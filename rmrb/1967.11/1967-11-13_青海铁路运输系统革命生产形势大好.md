The revolutionary workers of the Qinghai Railway system are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, strengthening ideological revolution, and promoting the flourishing development of the railway transportation industry. Since April, the transportation production indicators of the Xining Railway Bureau have been rising month by month, completing tasks every month. The volume of goods shipped and the efficiency of vehicle use have significantly improved, with no backlog of a single ton of materials, and a large number of car bodies have been saved for the state. The train operation order is normal, and not a single train has been delayed. The railway transportation industry throughout the province presents a busy yet orderly prosperous scene.

The Qinghai Railway workers regard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the best classroom for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They learn and apply in the struggle. The Xining Railway Bureau has three revolutionary mass organizations that have been fighting side by side during the Cultural Revolution and resolutely executing Chairman Mao's instructions on uniting the majority of cadres and the masses. They actively create conditions for fighting the "people's war" in revolution and production. They do not hold grudges against the deceived masses or narrow-minded interests of small groups but patiently do detailed ideological work, considering the winning over of one deceived mass as adding one more force to seize the revolution and promote production. For cadres who have made mistakes, they use the principle of "punishing the past to prevent the future and curing the sickness to save the patient," helping them recognize and correct their mistakes and quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To better seize the revolution and promote production, the three revolutionary mass organizations, after consultation and rectification, achieved a great alliance in June and established the Revolutionary Committee of the Railway System, setting up unified revolutionary organizations by unit. The great alliance of the revolutionary factions and the great unity of the revolutionary masses eliminated the difficulties caused by differences in opinion, forming a tremendous force for seizing the revolution and promoting production. In July and August this year, the Qinghai region experienced several heavy rains, and there were 63 water disasters in the railway and 6 in the electrical department within the jurisdiction of the Xining Railway Bureau, seriously threatening railway transportation. The bureau and its subordinate units united to organize a powerful anti-flood and rescue army, rushing to various dangerous sections, and tenaciously fighting against nature to repair the dangerous sections in time. The Xining Bureau and its subordinate units originally only managed transportation operations and did not manage engineering. To ensure smooth transportation, they did not request the higher authorities to send engineering teams but repaired some of the damaged bridges themselves with their utmost effort.

During the Cultural Revolution, both passenger and freight volumes have increased significantly. Railway workers, in the midst of busy transportation, have done everything possible to ensure normal transportation order. Loading and unloading are prepared in advance, and labor is organized scientifically for quick loading and unloading. The Qinghai Plateau has a relatively large railway slope, making it difficult for locomotives to start on uphill sections. The dispatching department pays attention to organizing intermediate trains, making it possible for downhill trains to give way to uphill trains, ensuring trains run on time.

The service staff at the Xining Station is relatively small. Whenever a train departs or arrives, off-duty workers voluntarily go to the platform to help maintain order. Sometimes, passengers from different mass organizations quarrel at the station or on the train, and some even make unreasonable demands to the station. Railway workers insist on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, using Chairman Mao's quotations to do ideological work for the passengers. Over the past half year, within the jurisdiction of the bureau, there has never been a situation where disputes affected the departure and normal operation of trains. Broad masses of workers, when talking about the good operation order, all excitedly say: "This is the great power of Mao Zedong Thought!"

Over the past half year, the Xining Railway Bureau has repeatedly helped brother provinces and regions transport various materials. When the brother provinces and regions lack power, they also actively dispatch locomotives to support them. This style has been praised by the brother bureaus.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Qinghai Railway Transportation System, in using Mao Zedong Thought to engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism, have severely criticized the revisionist goods pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Ministry of Railways, breaking some old frameworks that shackle productivity, and powerfully promoting the development of the transportation industry. The various units of the Xining Bureau, during the big criticism, organized shock troops to take the lead, attack key points, and mobilize the broad masses, fiercely criticizing the revisionist goods of indicators as the command, material incentives, and one-man management. They highlighted Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics, reforming some unreasonable rules and regulations. In transportation management, some procedures were previously too cumbersome, now simplified; some units had very rigid rules in the past, now adjusted more flexibly according to revolutionary needs. These have had a significant effect on further improving the railway transportation situation.

Recently, various factories and sections of the Xining Railway Bureau have set up full-time, part-time, and extracurricular Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to the characteristics of their units. The broad masses of workers are determined to, through self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, better execute Chairman Mao's cadre policy, better seize the revolution, and promote production.

    广大革命职工运用毛泽东思想不断斗私批修加强思想革命化
    青海铁路运输系统革命生产形势大好
    西宁铁路分局革命群众组织实现革命大联合，团结广大群众并肩战斗。四月份以来，运输生产指标逐月上升，月月完成任务，列车运行秩序正常，没有积压过一吨物资，没有少开出过一列车。
    本报讯　青海省铁路系统的革命职工，活学活用毛主席著作，不断斗私批修，破私立公，加强思想革命化，促进铁路运输事业蓬勃发展。今年四月份以来，西宁铁路分局的运输生产指标逐月上升，月月完成任务，货物的发运量和车辆的运用效率显著提高，没有积压过一吨物资，还为国家节省了大量的车皮；列车运行秩序正常，从来没有少开出一列车。全省的铁路运输事业，呈现出一派紧张而有秩序的繁荣景象。
    青海铁路职工把无产阶级文化大革命运动当作活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。西宁铁路分局有三个革命群众组织，在文化大革命中一直并肩战斗，并且坚决执行毛主席关于团结大多数干部和群众的指示，积极为在革命和生产上打
  “人民战争”创造条件。他们对于受蒙蔽群众，不计较个人恩怨和小团体的狭隘利益，而是耐心地做细致的思想工作，把多争取团结一个受蒙蔽群众，看作是为抓革命促生产多增加一分力量。他们对犯了错误的干部，运用“惩前毖后，治病救人”的原则，帮助他们认识和改正错误，迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。为了更有利于抓革命促生产，三个革命群众组织经过协商和整风，在六月份实现了革命大联合，成立了铁路系统革命派联合委员会，按单位建立了统一的革命组织。革命派大联合和革命群众大团结，消除了由于意见分歧而带来的困难，形成了抓革命促生产的巨大力量。今年七八月份，青海地区连续下了几场暴雨，西宁铁路分局管辖区内，工务上发生水害六十三处，电务上发生水害六处，严重地威胁着铁路运输。分局和所属单位，同心协力组织了强大的防洪抢险大军，分赴各个危险区段，顽强地同天斗同地斗，及时修复了险段。西宁分局和所属单位，原来只管运输营业不管工程，为了保证运输畅通，他们没有要求上级单位派工程队来，自己尽最大努力修复了一些遭受水害的桥梁工程。
    在文化大革命运动中，客货运量都大大增加。铁路职工在紧张繁忙的运输情况下，千方百计地保证正常的运输秩序。装车卸车都提前做好准备，科学地组织劳力快装快卸。青海高原铁道坡度较大，机车在上坡道起动较难，调度部门便注意组织途中列车，尽可能做到下坡车让上坡车，保证列车正点。
    西宁车站服务人员较少，每当列车开出或进站时，休班的职工都自动到站台帮助维持秩序。有时，属于不同群众组织的旅客在车站或车上发生争执，有的甚至向车站提出无法满足的要求，铁路工作人员坚持按毛泽东思想办事，引用毛主席语录给旅客做思想工作。半年多来，在分局管区内，铁路职工和旅客之间，旅客和旅客之间，从来没有发生因为闹纠纷而影响列车开出和正常运行的情况。广大职工在谈到运转秩序良好的情况时，都激动地说：“这是毛泽东思想的巨大威力！”
    半年多来，西宁铁路分局曾多次帮助兄弟省区运送各种物资，当兄弟省区分局动力缺少时，还主动调出机车去支援。这种风格，得到了兄弟省局的好评。
    青海铁路运输系统广大革命职工在运用毛泽东思想斗私批修中，狠批铁道部门党内一小撮走资派推行的修正主义黑货，破除了一些束缚生产力的旧框框，有力地推动了运输事业的发展。西宁分局各单位在大批判中，都组织了突击队打先锋，攻重点，带动广大群众，猛批指标挂帅、物质刺激和一长制等修正主义黑货，把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来。他们突出了毛泽东思想，突出了无产阶级政治，改革了一些不合理的规章制度。在运输管理上，以前有些手续过于繁琐，现在简化了；有些单位过去制度很死，现在根据革命需要作了比较灵活的调整。这些，对进一步改善铁路运输状况，产生了显著的效果。
    最近，西宁铁路分局各厂、段根据本单位特点，办起了脱产的、半脱产的和业余的毛泽东思想学习班。广大职工决心通过斗私批修，更好地执行毛主席的干部政策，更好地抓革命，促生产。
