We revolutionary cadres in the Jiamusi railway system, with the help of the propaganda team from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, have followed Chairman Mao's policy on cadres and released a large number of revolutionary leaders. However, there are still some reservations and misunderstandings about releasing the "first-in-command" at various levels. Some people think that the "first-in-command" is the "ringleader" of the bourgeois reactionary line and should not be released. Some people think that the "first-in-command" has many responsibilities and many mistakes, and that releasing them requires extreme caution. There are even some comrades who think that the "first-in-command" is subservient to the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and that there are hardly any good ones. These active thoughts directly affect the implementation of Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, hindering the "first-in-command" and more revolutionary cadres from coming forward.

What should we do? The propaganda team, in response to these active thoughts, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres" with the revolutionary cadres, guiding everyone to understand three issues: First, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are the ringleaders of the bourgeois reactionary line. The majority of the "first-in-command" unconsciously carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. They are both executors and victims of the bourgeois reactionary line and should not be regarded as "ringleaders." Second, for the "first-in-command," we should also follow Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, conduct a concrete analysis based on facts, look at the main issues, and look at the overall situation, rather than emphasizing "high position, high requirements." Third, the cadre policy of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and his "Self-Cultivation" have influenced and poisoned our cadres; however, Chairman Mao's cadre policy is dominant within the party. Most of our cadres are good or relatively good. The saying that there are "hardly any good ones" does not conform to the actual situation. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and analyze cadres comprehensively, historically, dialectically, and concretely, even for the "first-in-command" who have made serious mistakes.

After raising our awareness, we conducted a concrete analysis of the original division's "first-in-command," Party Committee Secretary Li Changhu. In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, he implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and suppressed and attacked revolutionary masses. However, he dared to admit and correct his mistakes, bravely took responsibility, sincerely welcomed the revolutionary factions' exposure and criticism of him, and drew a clear line with and fought against the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Historically, he grew from a locomotive driver to a cadre and, over the past decade, has always followed Chairman Mao's words, daring to fight against erroneous thoughts that oppose the prominence of proletarian politics, working seriously and responsibly, and maintaining the character of the working class. Thus, we saw both his current performance and his overall work situation, affirming that he is a revolutionary cadre. Therefore, we appointed him as the chairman of the revolutionary committee.

    怎样看待“第一把手”？
    我们佳木斯铁路系统的无产阶级革命派，在黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，遵照毛主席的干部政策，解放了一大批革命的领导干部。但是，对于解放各级第一把手，还有一些顾虑和模糊认识。有人认为“第一把手是推行资产阶级反动路线的‘罪魁祸首’，不能解放”。有人认为，“第一把手管事多，错误大，解放要慎之又慎之”；还有个别同志认为，“第一把手对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派唯命是从，没有几个好的。”等等。这些活思想，直接影响毛主席干部政策的贯彻执行，妨碍着第一把手和更多的革命干部站出来。
    怎么办？宣传队针对这些活思想，同无产阶级革命派一起，学习毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，引导大家认清了三个问题：一、党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是推行资产阶级反动路线的罪魁祸首。多数第一把手都是不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线，他们既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，又是受害者，决不能把他们当成“罪魁祸首”。二、对第一把手，同样要遵照毛主席的干部政策，实事求是地作具体分析，看大节，看主流，不能片面强调“职务高要求高”。三、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派推行的干部路线和他的《修养》，对我们干部有影响和毒害；但是，毛主席的干部路线在党内是占统治地位的，我们的干部大多数是好的或比较好的。所谓“没有几个好的”的说法，是不符合实际情况的。我们应当遵照毛主席的教导，全面地、历史地、辩证地、具体地分析干部，即使对犯了严重错误的第一把手也是一样。
    在认识提高以后，我们对原分局第一把手、党委书记李长湖进行了具体分析。在文化大革命初期，他执行过资产阶级反动路线，压制和打击过革命群众。但是，他敢于承认和改正错误，勇于承担责任，诚心诚意地欢迎革命派对自己的揭发批判，并同党内走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限，展开了斗争。从历史上看，他从一个火车司机成长为干部，十多年来，一直是听毛主席的话的，敢于同反对突出无产阶级政治的错误思想作斗争，工作认真负责，保持了工人阶级的本色。这样，我们既看到他现在的表现，又看到他一贯的工作情况，肯定他是革命干部。于是，选他担任了革委会主任委员。　龙卫东
