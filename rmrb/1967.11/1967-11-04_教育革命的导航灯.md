We members of the Beijing No. 23 Middle School Revolutionary Committee and the Military Training Team listened to Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution over the radio and immediately held a heated discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like a beacon, illuminating our path forward. We wholeheartedly support and will definitely carry out these instructions!

The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the Military Training Team carefully studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word. Team Leader Wang of the Military Training Team said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that revolution first requires solving the questions of who to rely on, who to unite with, and who to strike. Conducting an educational revolution also requires solving these questions first. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, relying on revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers to carry out a thorough proletarian educational revolution."

Comrade Liu Lin of the Revolutionary Committee said, "Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest encouragement, the greatest trust, and the greatest support for us, the proletarian revolutionary faction! We will not let Chairman Mao down. We will definitely fight a brilliant battle in this educational revolution!"

Everyone also recognized that thoroughly reforming the old educational system, teaching guidelines, and methods is an unprecedented great revolution. Only by resolutely following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, mobilizing the masses, and relying on the proletarian revolutionary faction, can we carry out the educational revolution well and establish a brand-new proletarian educational system. Our school has been reforming since May, combining classes with practice and reform. We fully mobilized revolutionary teachers and students to discuss and have already formulated an educational reform plan. In terms of the educational system, teaching content, methods, and other aspects, we have boldly carried out reforms and initially achieved some results. However, after seeing the educational reform plans of several schools like Shanghai Tongji University, we were greatly inspired and felt that there is still a significant gap. We must dare to innovate, break old traditions, and boldly create new things in the proletarian educational revolution to achieve new merits and innovations for the people.

    教育革命的导航灯
    北京二十三中革命委员会  解放军驻二十三中军训团
    我们北京二十三中革命委员会和军训团的同志们，从广播中听到了毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示后，立即进行了热烈的讨论。大家一致认为，毛主席的最新指示，就象一盏光芒四射的导航灯，为我们照亮了前进的路程。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办！
    革委会和军训团的同志们在一起，逐字逐句地反复琢磨，领会毛主席最新指示的精神。军训团王团长说：“毛主席教导我们，革命首先要解决依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁的问题。进行教育革命，也必须首先解决这个问题。我们要坚决遵照毛主席的最新指示，依靠革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，把无产阶级教育革命搞好，搞彻底。”革委会的刘琳同志说：“毛主席的最新指示，是对我们无产阶级革命派的最大鼓舞，最大信任，最大支持！我们决不辜负他老人家的教导。我们一定在这场教育革命中打一个漂亮仗！”
    大家还认识到，彻底改革旧的教育制度、教学方针、方法，是一场史无前例的大革命。只有坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，坚决依靠无产阶级革命派，才能把教育革命搞好，才能创立崭新的无产阶级教育制度。我们学校从五月份起，边复课，边实践，边改革，充分发动革命师生员工讨论，已经制定了教育改革方案，在教育体制、教学内容、方法等方面，大胆地进行了改革，初步取得了一些成绩。但是，当我们看了上海同济大学等几所学校的教改方案后，给我们很大启发，感到还有很大差距。我们一定要敢字当头，大破大立，大胆创新，在无产阶级教育革命中，为人民立新功创新劳。
