The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Datong City, Shanxi Province, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, and launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This has greatly promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres have brought the high revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into the struggle of production. The revolution and production in the whole city present an unprecedentedly good situation. The coal production in October increased significantly compared to September, and the coal production in November is even more thriving.

The ship sails by relying on the helmsman, and all things grow by relying on the sun. Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Datong City has never been as widespread and deep as it is today, and the masses' awareness of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls has never been as high as it is today. Reading Chairman Mao's works every day has become an unshakable institution.

Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad revolutionary masses have further aroused their hatred towards revisionism. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, combine it with the struggle-criticism-transformation in their own regions and units, and have launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the socialist labor enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses is even higher. In the Datong Coal Mine, which accounts for one-third of the city's population, the broad revolutionary cadres have expressed their determination to always put the public interest first, produce more coal for the revolution, and produce good coal. The revolutionary cadres of the No. 61 Coal Mining Team of the Red Second Mine have, under the difficult conditions of a long working face and thin coal seam, displayed the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting. They have continuously created the new record of double-shift mining per day, and have increased production efficiency many times over. Many family members of the cadres have also rushed to the mine to participate in voluntary labor, help in the cadre canteen, and propagate at the wellhead, doing everything possible to support coal production.

    大同形势空前大好  煤炭生产节节胜利
    最近两个月煤炭产量比九月份大幅度增长
    据新华社太原二十二日电　山西省大同市的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，大大促进人的思想革命化。广大革命职工把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的高度革命热情，运用到生产斗争中去。全市革命和生产都呈现出一派空前大好形势。十月份这里的煤炭产量比九月份大幅度增长，十一月份的煤炭生产更是蒸蒸日上。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。大同市活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动从来没有象今天这样广泛深入，广大群众用毛泽东思想改造灵魂的自觉性从来没有象今天这样高涨。天天读毛主席著作，已成为雷打不动的制度。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，通过活学活用毛主席著作，更加激起了对修正主义的仇恨。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，结合本地区本单位的斗批改，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，广大革命群众的社会主义劳动积极性更加高涨。在占全市人口三分之一的大同煤矿，广大革命职工表示，要时时、事事公字当头，为革命多出煤，出好煤。红二矿六一采煤队的革命职工，在工作面长、煤层薄的困难条件下，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，连续创造日采双循环的新纪录，成倍地提高了生产效率。许多职工家属也纷纷到矿上参加义务劳动，到职工食堂帮厨，到井口去宣传，千方百计支援煤炭生产。
