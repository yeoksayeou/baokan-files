Our great leader Chairman Mao has instructed us in his latest directive: "We must properly solve the problem of relations between superiors and subordinates, and between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres must go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

We must forever engrave this extremely important directive of Chairman Mao in our hearts and carry it out to the letter, ensuring that we truly do so.

The question of how to treat the masses has always been a touchstone for distinguishing true from false Marxist-Leninists and a key to the success or failure of the revolution.

Proletarian revolutionaries have always regarded themselves as the sons of the laboring people and students of the masses. In contrast, representatives of the exploiting classes have always treated the masses as "mob" and regarded themselves as "saviors" towering above the masses. Look: China's Khrushchev wants the masses to be his "tame tools," and the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Dehuai also calls himself the "father of the people."

The great tide of the Cultural Revolution has pushed many of us new cadres to the forefront of the revolutionary leadership. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We new cadres on the revolutionary leadership posts must work diligently and humbly to do our jobs well, without any reason to be complacent or satisfied with the status quo. We must especially remember Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The masses are the real heroes." "Without boundless enthusiasm, without the resolve to look down, without the desire to learn, without the spirit of putting down airs and being willing to be a small student, one is definitely unable to do it and definitely will not be able to do it well."

"Being students of the masses" is our Party's fine tradition. We must forever maintain this glorious tradition, stand among the masses, learn from the masses, and discuss and deliberate on issues with the masses, fully reflecting the revolutionary demands of the broad masses.

Through the great mass struggle of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, we have deeply realized that after the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, the struggle between the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the prevention of the restoration of the proletariat still exists. The bourgeoisie is always trying to corrupt and infiltrate us proletarian revolutionaries, especially the leadership core, and carry out "peaceful evolution." Therefore, before us, there are still two possible choices: one is to always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat; the other is to gradually develop a sense of complacency and self-satisfaction in victory, listen to different opinions less and less, and even suppress them, alienate oneself from the masses, and thus be hit by the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, fall into the mire of revisionism, and become new representatives of the bourgeoisie.

Therefore, turning Chairman Mao's great banner of "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" into great practice, and establishing a new type of cadre-mass relationship, is a strategic and fundamental task. Only in this way can we always maintain a firm and correct political direction, always maintain the simple and hardworking character of the laboring people, always maintain the "fish-water relationship" with the people, and ensure that our great motherland forever advances along the brilliant road of Mao Zedong Thought to victory!

    把群众路线的光荣传统接过来传下去
    天津大学八·一三红卫兵指挥部
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”
    我们要永远把毛主席的这个极其重要的指示，铭刻在心头，不折不扣地执行，切切实实地做到。
    如何对待群众的问题，向来是检验真假马克思列宁主义者的试金石，向来是革命胜败的关键。
    无产阶级革命家，从来就把自己看成是劳动人民的儿子，是群众的小学生。相反，历来的剥削阶级代表人物，都是把群众当作“群氓”，把自己看成是高踞于群众头上的“救世主”。试看：中国赫鲁晓夫要群众当他的“驯服工具”，反革命修正主义分子彭德怀也以“民之父母”自命。
    无产阶级文化大革命的激流，把我们一大批新干部推上了革命的领导岗位。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们新干部在革命的领导岗位上，只能兢兢业业、谦虚谨慎地把工作做好，而没有丝毫的理由沾沾自喜，满足于现状。我们更要牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“群众是真正的英雄”，“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的”。
      “做群众的小学生”，这是我们党的优良传统。我们要永远保持这个光荣传统，站在群众之中，向群众学习，跟群众一起商量、讨论问题，充分反映广大群众的革命要求。
    经过一年多来文化大革命的伟大群众斗争，我们深刻地认识到，无产阶级革命派掌权之后，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争依然存在。资产阶级每时每刻都在试图对我们无产阶级革命派，特别是对领导核心，进行腐蚀侵袭，搞“和平演变”。因此，在我们面前，仍然存在着两个可能的选择：一个是，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众，依靠群众，巩固和加强无产阶级专政；一个是，在胜利中逐渐滋长骄傲自满情绪，不同的意见愈来愈听不进去，甚至加以压制，脱离群众，这就有可能被资产阶级的糖弹所击中，跌入修正主义的泥坑，成为新的资产阶级代表人物。
    因此，把毛主席的“斗私，批修”这个伟大的纲领，变成伟大的实践，建立新型的干群关系，是具有战略意义的根本建设。只有这样，才能使我们永远保持坚定正确的政治方向，才能永远保持艰苦朴素的劳动人民的本色，才能永远保持同人民群众的“鱼水关系”，才能保证我们伟大祖国永远沿着毛泽东思想的光辉道路胜利前进！
