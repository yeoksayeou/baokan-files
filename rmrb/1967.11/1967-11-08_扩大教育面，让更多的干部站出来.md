Under the great call of Chairman Mao to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, we recently held a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. The participants were cadres who had made some mistakes and had not yet come forward. The study class started with education, adhering to the principle of "learning from past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," and conducted extensive political and ideological work on the cadres who had made mistakes, achieving remarkable results.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to dispel doubts and clarify the direction

In our unit, many cadres, influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line and poisoned by "Self-Cultivation," and with their bourgeois worldview not thoroughly transformed, made mistakes to varying degrees in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We analyzed the main reasons for these cadres' mistakes as being due to the "selfish" tendencies. To help them recognize and correct their mistakes, we must first eliminate the "selfish" tendencies and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

At the beginning of the study class, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. Chairman Mao's pointing out of the great situation inspired and deeply enlightened every cadre in the study class. Some comrades thought of their execution of the bourgeois reactionary line, which had obstructed the new things of the revolution, and felt deeply remorseful. With this understanding, everyone began to open up their thoughts. Many people talked about how, after making mistakes, they only passively waited for the organization to deal with them, and their mood was quite depressed. Some also talked about how, due to their many selfish thoughts, they previously wanted to discuss their thoughts with revolutionaries but were afraid of being accused of "trying to squeeze in," so their thoughts piled up more and more, and their mental burden became heavier. They said these erroneous thoughts were all products of the "selfish" tendencies and must be uprooted.

After the first stage of study, the participants felt much lighter, having put down their mental burdens. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, they clarified their direction, shifting from caring about personal matters to caring about national affairs.

Comparing with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to find one's own problems

Based on the mistakes made in the past and some common real thoughts, after basically opening up their thoughts, the study class organized everyone to focus on studying Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles on the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They distinguished who our enemies and friends are in the socialist period under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and drew the line between the bourgeois headquarters and the proletarian headquarters, and between the bourgeois reactionary line and the proletarian revolutionary line. Because these cadres had been working for a long time, they were more familiar with the democratic revolution, clearly distinguishing who the enemies and friends were in the struggle against landlords and distributing land, and clearly seeing who the enemies and friends were in fighting Chiang Kai-shek with clear weapons. Their thoughts were still basically stuck in the democratic revolution period, and they could not keep up when it came to the socialist revolution stage. Therefore, they did not understand Chairman Mao's repeated teachings that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, and the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Due to their unclear understanding, they could not hate the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and their exposure and struggle were weak.

To deepen the understanding of this issue, the cadres participating in the study class also linked it to reality during their study, conducting specific analyses of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in their region and unit. They connected these individuals' anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes with those of China's Khrushchev. Many facts showed that the handful of power-holders within the unit who are taking the capitalist road and China's Khrushchev are indeed birds of a feather. If their schemes succeed, our country will indeed change color, and the heads of millions of people will roll. At the same time, everyone reviewed the evil facts of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in pushing the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, further recognizing the conspiracy of these bad elements. This stage of study raised the banner of the struggle between the two lines, and everyone had many personal experiences of the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line and why the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road insist on pushing the bourgeois reactionary line and their conspiracies. Therefore, in their thoughts and emotions, they aroused hatred towards the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and their chief backer, China's Khrushchev. Due to the change in their thoughts and emotions, they exposed many new problems about the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in the study meetings. While hating the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, they also began to love the revolutionaries. They expressed their determination to fight alongside the revolutionaries and struggle to the end with the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

Using the "Three Articles" to touch the soul and uproot selfishness

After the participating cadres' awareness was raised, they further launched a thorough attack on "selfishness" to find the root cause of their mistakes. This stage focused on studying the "Three Articles."

Why did one make mistakes? In the past, some cadres found more objective reasons and fewer subjective ones. Later, although they all said in theory that it was due to "selfishness," when it came to themselves, it seemed not to be the case.

What is selfishness, and what is public-spiritedness? Initially, some people only measured themselves from minor aspects, but gradually, they realized that being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public-spiritedness. Many comrades, using this standard to examine themselves, found that they fell far short. Their minds were not led by the public-spiritedness but were dominated by selfishness. Chairman Mao called for: "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" But in their minds, they were considering personal gains and losses, wasn't this a big "selfishness"?

Through this stage of study, the awareness was raised to a higher level. The root of "selfishness" was found, and the mistakes made and criticized were accepted. In summarizing the study, some cadres said that after making mistakes, they recorded two accounts: one account was recorded on the head of the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road because they were deceived by him; the other account was recorded on their own head because their "selfishness" was not eliminated, and their worldview was not transformed well. They expressed their determination to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road led by China's Khrushchev, and to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

### 扩大教育面，让更多的干部站出来

    扩大教育面，让更多的干部站出来
    江西省供销社宜春专区办事处捍卫毛泽东思想战斗队
    在毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召下，我们最近开办了一期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习班的是犯过一些错误、还没有站出来的领导干部。学习班从教育入手，本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，对犯错误的干部进行了大量政治思想工作，收到了显著的效果。
        用毛泽东思想解除顾虑明辨方向
    我们单位的干部中，许多人由于受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，受了《修养》的毒害，加上自己的资产阶级世界观没有彻底改造，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中程度不同地犯了错误。我们分析这些领导干部犯错误的主要原因是“私”字作怪，要帮助他们认识和改正错误，必须首先打掉“私”字，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑。
    学习班一开始，我们就组织大家学习毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示。毛主席指出的一片大好形势，对学习班每个干部鼓舞很大，启发很深。有的同志想到自己执行资产阶级反动路线，对革命的新生事物起了阻碍作用，内心很沉痛。有了这个认识，大家纷纷亮思想。不少人谈到，犯了错误后，只是消极地等待组织处理，情绪比较消沉。还有的谈到，由于自己私心杂念多，过去想找革命派谈思想情况，怕人家说想“削尖脑袋钻进来”，于是思想问题越积越多，思想包袱也就越重。他们说，这些错误思想，都是“私”字的产物，必须把“私”字挖掉。
    通过第一阶段的学习，参加学习的同志思想包袱放下来了，感到轻松得多。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，他们明确了方向，由关心个人变为关心国家大事。
      对照毛主席的革命路线找自己的问题
    根据大家过去所犯的错误和一些共同的现实思想状况，在基本亮开思想以后，学习班就组织大家着重学习了毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，分清在社会主义时期，在无产阶级专政的条件下，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，划清资产阶级司令部和无产阶级司令部、资产阶级反动路线同无产阶级革命路线的界限。因为这些干部参加工作的时间比较长，他们对民主革命比较熟悉，打土豪分田地，明刀明枪打蒋介石，谁是敌人、谁是朋友一看就清楚，他们的思想，有的还基本上停留在民主革命时期，一到社会主义革命阶段就跟不上了。因此，对毛主席一再教导的，在无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派这一光辉理论认识不清。由于思想认识不清，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，感情上就恨不起来，揭发斗争也就口硬心软。
    为了加深对这个问题的理解，参加学习班的干部在学习中，还联系实际，对本地区、本单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行具体剖析，把他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行和中国的赫鲁晓夫对上号、挂上钩。许多事实说明，本单位的党内走资本主义道路当权派和中国的赫鲁晓夫的确是一丘之貉，他们的那一套如果得逞，我们的国家确实要改变颜色，千百万人头就要落地。同时，大家又回顾了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文化大革命运动中推行资产阶级反动路线的罪恶事实，进一步认清了这一小撮坏家伙的阴谋。这一阶段的学习，上了两条路线斗争这个纲，大家对资产阶级反动路线的危害性以及对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为什么要死死推行资产阶级反动路线的目的和阴谋也有了许多切身的体会，从而在思想感情上激起了对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨。由于思想感情上起了变化，他们在学习会上揭发了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派许多新问题。在对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派恨得起的同时，他们对革命派也爱起来了。他们表示要和革命派团结战斗在一起，和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争到底。
      用“老三篇”触灵魂，挖“私”根
    参加学习的干部认识提高以后，就进一步倒树盘根地向“私”字开火，找出犯错误的根本原因。这一阶段着重学习了“老三篇”。
    为什么自己会犯错误，过去有些干部在客观上找的原因多，主观上找得少，后来虽然在道理上都说是“私”字作怪，但一联系到本身，似乎又不是这么一回事。
    究竟什么是私，什么是公？开初有些人只是从小节方面衡量自己，后来，逐渐认识到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这就是最大的“公”。不少同志，拿着这个标准来对照自己，就发现差得很远，脑子里不是“公”字当头，而是“私”字在作怪。毛主席号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”而自己脑子里却是考虑个人得失的问题，这不就是一个很大的“私”字吗？
    通过这一阶段的学习，认识上了纲。“私”字这条根也就找到了，犯错误受批判也服气了。在总结学习心得时，有的干部说，犯了错误，记上两笔账：一笔账记在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的头上，因为受了他的蒙蔽；一笔账记在自己的头上，因为自己的“私”字没有打掉，世界观没有改造好。他们表示，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的教导，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒。　（新华社发，本报有删节）
