We walked into a barber shop in Pinggu County town, and a strong political atmosphere invigorated our spirits: at the center of the entrance, a large colored portrait of Chairman Mao hung prominently; on the whitewashed walls, there were quotations from Chairman Mao such as “You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!” and large-character slogans like “Uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.” There were also propaganda posters; on the table, a radio was broadcasting the revolutionary song “Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Lead the Cultural Revolution.” The barber shop was filled with the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

The radio began broadcasting a news program, introducing the experiences of liberating revolutionary cadres. A worker sitting there muttered to himself, “It’s good that revolutionary cadres have come forward. Chairman Mao teaches us to believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. After the two major factions in our construction company united, we first resolved the cadre issue, quickly achieved the revolutionary ‘three-in-one combination,’ and established a new leadership team.” As soon as he finished speaking, the barber chimed in, “That’s right. Those who couldn’t unite had many conflicts over the cadre issue.” I casually added, “Master, how is the great unity here going?” The barber, while washing someone’s hair, chuckled and said, “We united long ago. Chairman Mao issued the directive for great unity, and we discussed it through the night, resolutely carrying it out. We quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.”

Our conversation then turned to Liu Shaoqi, with each of us criticizing Liu Shaoqi’s revisionist fallacies such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle, the “three freedoms and one contract,” and the “four freedoms.”

As we left the barber shop and walked down the street, we discussed our impressions from the barber shop and came to a conclusion: Dear Chairman Mao, your brilliant thoughts illuminate everyone’s heart, and have fully mobilized hundreds of millions of people. This is the most reliable guarantee that our motherland will never change color!

    阳光照亮理发室
    我们走进平谷县城一个理发馆里，一派浓厚的政治空气使人精神振奋：进门的正中央，高挂着毛主席的彩色画像；刷白的墙壁上贴着毛主席语录“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”和大字标语
  “大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威”，另外还张贴了宣传画；桌案上的收音机里，正在播送着《工农兵文化革命打先锋》的战斗歌曲。理发馆里充满了毛泽东思想的阳光。
    收音机里开始广播新闻节目，介绍解放革命干部的经验。在座的一位工人自言自语地说：“革命的干部站出来，好得很。毛主席教导我们要相信和依靠干部的大多数，我们建筑公司两大派大联合后，先解决干部问题，很快就实现了革命的‘三结合’，成立了新的领导班子。”他的话刚完，理发师傅就开了腔：“谁说不是，联合不起来的，好些都是在干部问题上闹矛盾。”我随口插了一句：“老师傅，你们这里的大联合搞得咋样啊？”老师傅一边给别人洗头，一边笑呵呵地说：“早就联合了。毛主席他老人家发出了大联合的指示，我们连夜讨论，坚决照办，很快就实现了革命的大联合。”
    我们的话题又转到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，你一言，我一语，对中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义谬论，进行了狠狠的批判。
    我们理完发走到路上，谈论在理发馆的感受，得出一个结论：敬爱的毛主席呵，您老人家的光辉思想照亮了每一个人的心，把亿万群众都充分发动起来了，这就是我们祖国永不变色的最可靠的保证！
