Revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Agricultural University are resolutely carrying out the strategy of resuming classes and making revolution, determined to stay in school to carry out a thorough criticism and reform, and to create a brand-new proletarian educational system according to Chairman Mao's strategic deployment.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th, revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Agricultural University have, during the process of resuming classes and making revolution, launched a mass criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pursued by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the school. They are carrying out a struggle-criticism-reform movement within the school, and the educational revolution on campus is showing a very good situation. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students are determined to adhere to the direction of resuming classes and making revolution, to teach while reforming and practicing, and to implement the great leader Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution. They are determined to achieve new victories in creating a brand-new proletarian educational system.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at Beijing Agricultural University responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao to resume classes and make revolution in primary, secondary, and higher schools. They began resuming classes and making revolution on October 21st. Before resuming classes and making revolution, they held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, through which they criticized and repudiated revisionism and promoted and consolidated the revolutionary three-in-one combination and the revolutionary great alliance. At present, more than 95 percent of the cadres have been liberated, and cultural revolution groups have been established in every class.

In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary committee of the school first organized all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution and to seriously discuss the great significance of resuming classes and making revolution. This enabled everyone to clearly understand that the central task of resuming classes and making revolution is to carry out a great educational revolution, to carry out a struggle-criticism-reform movement within the school, and to thoroughly smash the old educational system, old teaching guidelines, and methods. They will blaze a trail for a brand-new proletarian educational system. They followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Starting from class education, they launched a great exposure, denunciation, and criticism of the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. In more than a month, the entire school, various departments, and various specialties held about eighty criticism meetings. They used Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to angrily denounce and criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who colluded with reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to seize the educational front and attempted to restore capitalism. This great criticism further exposed the cover of the seventeen-year struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines at Beijing Agricultural University, making the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie lose their prestige. It greatly aroused the hatred of the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff for the revisionist educational line pursued by China's Khrushchev and further strengthened their determination to thoroughly reform the old educational system. In the process of the great criticism, they took Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline. On the basis of preliminary investigation and research, they proposed dozens of plans for reforming agricultural education.

Just as the educational revolution at Beijing Agricultural University was about to advance a step further, some students thought that the current focus of the movement should shift from the great criticism to the debate on the educational reform plan, and that after the debate, everyone should "march" to the countryside. They believed that teaching professional courses before the teaching guidelines and system have been thoroughly reformed is actually a restoration of the old ways, and is "eating rotten pears." They advocated thoroughly reforming and then "eating new pears."

The revolutionary committee of the school promptly led the entire school to carry out a great debate in response to these active thoughts. Many comrades believed that the agricultural university must be established among five hundred million peasants, which is the correct direction for reforming agricultural education. However, the current task is to stay in school to carry out a thorough criticism and reform within the school according to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Chairman Mao taught us: "A brand-new social system must be established on the basis of the old system, and it must clear away this basis." To thoroughly smash the old educational system, we must sit down and do a great deal of painstaking work, and we cannot "walk away." Many comrades also reviewed the experience and lessons of the past educational reforms at the university. They said: The educational revolution in 1958 later took a U-turn, and in 1964, it fell for China's Khrushchev's "two educational systems." Apart from the fact that the leadership of the school was usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the failure to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie was an important reason. Now, although the proletarian revolutionary faction has seized the leadership of the school from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, it is still necessary to seize the educational power completely in politics, ideology, and theory. The urgent task at hand is to carry out a more extensive and in-depth great criticism and struggle-criticism-reform movement within the school, and to grasp the key points to thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist educational line that has been implemented at the university for the past seventeen years. Everyone also believed that while carrying out the great criticism, resuming some professional courses, teaching while practicing and reforming, is not a restoration of the old ways, but a necessary way to complete the proletarian educational revolution in practice. Everyone also believed that under the premise of adhering to the direction of resuming classes and making revolution, a small number of teams can be sent to the countryside and pastoral areas under leadership, planning, and with a purpose, to consult with poor and lower-middle peasants and herdsmen, to investigate and practice while studying the plans for reforming agricultural education.

Through this debate, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school unified their thoughts, raised their awareness, and decided to adhere to the direction of resuming classes and making revolution, to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle-criticism-reform movement within the school, to teach while reforming. They also realized that to adhere to the correct direction of resuming classes and making revolution, it is necessary to take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself" as the guideline and to closely combine the educational revolution with the thought revolution of the people.

    复课闹革命是当前学校中斗争大方向
    北京农业大学革命师生坚持复课闹革命，决心按照毛主席的战略部署，留在学校里搞好革命大批判和本单位斗批改，创造出崭新的无产阶级教育制度
    据新华社二十五日讯　北京农业大学革命师生在复课闹革命中，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在学校的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线展开了群众性的大批判，进行本单位的斗批改，全校的教育革命出现了一派大好形势。广大革命师生决心坚持复课闹革命的大方向，边教学，边改革，边实践，贯彻实行伟大领袖毛主席的教育革命思想，在创造崭新的无产阶级教育制度中立新功。
    北京农业大学的革命师生员工响应伟大领袖毛主席大中小学校都要复课闹革命的号召，于十月二十一日开始了复课闹革命。在复课闹革命以前，他们大办毛泽东思想学习班，通过斗私批修，大大促进和巩固了革命的三结合和革命的大联合。目前，全校百分之九十五以上的干部已经解放，各个班级普遍建立了文化革命小组。
    在复课闹革命中，校革命委员会首先组织全校革命师生员工反复学习毛主席有关教育革命的指示，认真讨论了复课闹革命的伟大意义，使大家明确认识到，复课闹革命的中心任务就是要进行一场极其伟大的教育革命，搞好本单位的斗批改，彻底摧毁旧的教育制度、旧的教学方针和方法，闯出一个崭新的无产阶级教育制度来。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的教导，从阶级教育入手，对资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象展开了大揭发、大控诉、大批判。一个多月以来，全校、各系、各专业举行了各种批判会约有八十次。他们以毛泽东思想为最锐利的武器，愤怒控诉和批判了党内一小撮走资派，勾结资产阶级反动学术“权威”，霸占教育阵地，妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。这场大批判进一步揭开了北京农业大学十七年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，使资产阶级反动学术“权威”威风扫地，极大地激发了广大革命师生员工对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线的仇恨，更加坚定了他们彻底改革旧教育制度的决心。在大批判的过程中，他们以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，在初步调查研究的基础上提出了几十个改革农业教育的设想方案。
    正当北京农业大学的教育革命运动需要前进一步的时候，一部分同学认为，当前运动的重点应当由革命的大批判转到辩论教改方案上去，辩论完了统统“杀”向农村，“坐在大楼里搞教改只能是小破小立”。他们还认为，在教学方针、体制没有进行彻底改革以前上业务课实际上是复旧，是“吃烂梨子”，主张彻底改革以后再“吃新的梨子”。
    校革命委员会针对这些活思想及时领导全校开展了一场大辩论。许多同志认为，农业大学一定要办到五亿农民中去，这是改革农业教育的正确方向。但是，当前必须根据毛主席的伟大战略部署，留在学校里搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。毛主席教导我们：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。”我们要彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，就要坐下来做巨大的、艰苦细致的工作，决不可以“一走了之”。不少同志还回顾了农大过去教育改革失败的经验教训。他们说：一九五八年的教育革命后来走了回头路，一九六四年又上了中国赫鲁晓夫“两种教育制度”的当。除了被党内一小撮走资派篡夺了学校的领导权这个原因外，对修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动学术“权威”没有好好批判是一个重要原因。现在无产阶级革命派虽然从党内一小撮走资派手中夺回了学校的领导权，但是还需要从政治上、思想上、理论上把教育大权完全夺过来。当务之急，就是要更加广泛深入地开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，一定要抓住要害，把农大十七年来所贯彻的一条修正主义教育路线系统地批深批透。大家还认为，在大批判的同时，复一定的业务课，边教学，边实践，边改革，决不是复旧，而是在实践中完成无产阶级教育革命的必要途径。大家也认为，在坚持复课闹革命的前提下，可以有领导、有计划、有目的地派出少量的小分队到农村和牧区去，向贫下中农和牧民请教，边调查边实践，研究改革农业教育的方案。
    通过这场辩论，全校革命师生员工统一了思想，提高了认识，决心坚持复课闹革命的大方向，搞好革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，一边教学，一边改革。他们还认识到，要坚持复课闹革命的正确方向，就必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，把教育革命和人的思想革命化紧密结合起来。（附图片）
