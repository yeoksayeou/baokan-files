Laotian Patriotic Military and People Achieve Major Victory in Rainy Season, Annihilating Over 5,000 Enemies

Prince Souphanouvong and the Liberation Army High Command Call for Greater Victories

KANGO, Nov. 15 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on Nov. 14, the Laotian People's Liberation Army High Command issued a report on Nov. 4 detailing the achievements of the rainy season (from June to October) this year. The report enthusiastically hailed the significant victories achieved by the Laotian patriotic military and people during the rainy season battles and called on them to press forward and achieve even greater victories in the winter and spring dry season battles.

The report stated that, according to statistics, the Laotian patriotic military and people engaged in 543 battles over the five months of this year's rainy season, annihilating 5,106 enemy troops, including 3,104 killed. During this period, the Laotian patriotic military and people also shot down and destroyed 82 enemy aircraft, sank 33 enemy boats, and captured or destroyed a large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, including 80 recoilless guns and mortars and 101 light and heavy machine guns.

The report said that the achievements of the Laotian patriotic military and people in the five months of this year's rainy season are close to the achievements of the 1966-1967 dry season over seven months and are twice as much as the achievements of last year's rainy season.

The report said that the victories achieved by the Laotian patriotic military and people in this year's rainy season are immensely significant and glorious. These victories prove that the leadership of the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front is correct. These victories demonstrate the resolute fighting spirit of the Laotian patriotic military and people and their rapid growth in all aspects.

The report said that these victories have pushed the enemy deeper into a desperate situation and have deepened their internal contradictions. The morale of the puppet army has also further declined.

The report called on the Laotian patriotic military and people to heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and smash all military adventures and plots by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving even greater victories in the winter and spring dry season.

KANGO, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on Nov. 15, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front, wrote a letter on Nov. 13 to the Laotian patriotic military and people, enthusiastically commending their glorious victories in the rainy season battles.

The letter said that the Laotian patriotic military and people achieved this great success "because all cadres, soldiers, and compatriots have highly demonstrated the spirit of loving the motherland and hating the enemy, the spirit of bravely sacrificing for the motherland and the people, the determination to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and actively followed the leadership of the Central Committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front."

The letter said that this victory has shattered the enemy's plans of gradual infiltration and attacks and has made them fall into a state of helplessness and desperation. At the same time, it has laid a good foundation for the Laotian patriotic military and people to smash the new military adventure plans of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and achieve greater victories in the dry season.

Prince Souphanouvong called on the Laotian patriotic military and people in the letter to further heighten their vigilance, be prepared at all times, strengthen their resolve to attack the enemy, and defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving even more glorious victories in the dry season. The Laotian People's Liberation Army will press forward to annihilate the enemy.
