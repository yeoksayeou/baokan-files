All levels of schools, from primary to university, must resume classes and carry out the revolution, as stipulated by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. We must execute this policy without any deviation. In the process of resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, various difficulties and new problems will inevitably arise. How should revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers address these difficulties and problems? The schools in Tianjin, including the 105th Middle School, did not adopt a passive and dependent attitude. Instead, they actively mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and self-reliantly solved various difficulties, ensuring that the resumption of classes and the revolution proceeded smoothly. This revolutionary spirit is worth learning from.

Overcome the "Wait" Mentality, Reform While Teaching

After our school resumed classes and carried out the revolution, we encountered a series of new problems regarding how to teach and how to reform. Some comrades, not knowing where to start, developed a "wait" mentality: waiting for experience, textbooks, and new educational systems before starting reforms. Some comrades said, "All schools across the country are resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, so we don't need to rush."

The PLA comrades executing military training tasks addressed this mindset by first organizing the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to study relevant documents, helping everyone understand that the educational revolution is a grand undertaking that previous generations have not accomplished. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and act, conducting teaching practices and reforms simultaneously, and absolutely not adopting a passive waiting attitude.

After raising awareness, those who had previously waited and observed no longer did so; those who had previously been idle no longer were. Everyone actively participated in various activities for resuming classes and carrying out the revolution. To better carry out teaching reforms, the school and each class established reform groups, taking Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline. They adhered to the mass line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, reforming and innovating while teaching, and each class created some experiences. Some classes exposed the crimes of the revisionist educational line, igniting the revolutionary spirit of revolutionary teachers and students. When encountering difficulties, some classes held "frontline" meetings, where everyone contributed ideas and solutions, collectively discussing and solving problems encountered during the resumption of classes.

    大中小学都要复课闹革命，是毛主席、党中央的方针，我们一定要不折不扣地执行。在复课闹革命的过程中，必然会碰到各种各样的困难，出现一些新的问题。我们革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人，应当用什么样的态度对待这些困难和问题呢？天津一○五中学等学校，没有采取消极等待和依赖的态度，而是积极发动群众，依靠群众，自力更生，解决了种种困难，使复课闹革命得以顺利进行。这种革命精神，值得学习。

    克服“等”字，边教学边改革
    我们学校复课闹革命以后，遇到了怎么教学，怎么改革等一系列新问题。有一些同志由于不知从何入手，产生了“等”的思想：等有了经验、教材、新的教育制度以后，再着手改革。有的同志说，全国各学校都在复课闹革命，我们不用着急。
    执行军训任务的解放军同志针对这种思想，首先组织全校革命师生学习有关文件，使大家认识到，教育革命是前人没有做过的豪迈事业，必须发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，一边进行教学实践，一边进行改革，绝不能消极等待。
    大家思想认识提高后，原来等待观望的同志不等了；原来逍遥的不再逍遥了，都积极投入复课闹革命的各种活动。为了更好地进行教学改革，校部和各班都成立了教改小组，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，坚持从群众中来，到群众中去的群众路线，边破边立，边教边改，各班都创造了一些经验。有的班大摆修正主义教育路线的罪状，激发了革命师生的革命斗志。有的班遇到难题时，召开“火线”会议，大家出主意，想办法，群策群力，共同研究，解决复课中的难题。
