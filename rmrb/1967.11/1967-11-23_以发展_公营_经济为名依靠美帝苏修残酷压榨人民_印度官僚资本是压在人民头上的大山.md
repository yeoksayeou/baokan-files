Over the past decade, the Indian reactionary government, under the pretext of building a "socialist-type society," has used the power of the reactionary state to develop state monopoly capitalism—bureaucratic capitalism—in the name of developing "state-owned" economy. At present, the paid-in capital of such "state-owned" enterprises in India has almost reached half of the total paid-in capital of all companies in India, becoming a heavy burden on the Indian people.

One characteristic of Indian bureaucratic capital is the concentration of capital and rapid accumulation. According to Indian official statistics, from the 1956-57 fiscal year to the 1964-65 fiscal year, over eight years, the number of Indian "state-owned" enterprises increased from 74 to 183, with paid-in capital increasing nearly fourteenfold. At that time, these 183 "state-owned" enterprises, although they accounted for only 0.7% of the total number of joint-stock companies in India, occupied 40% of the total paid-in capital of all companies.

The great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, summed up the history of imperialist aggression against China, pointing out: "For the sake of aggression, imperialism created a comprador system and bureaucratic capital in China." The situation in India is exactly the same.

Most of India's "state-owned" enterprises are built and expanded with the help of imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique. For example, many of India's railways, ports, water conservancy projects, and power generation enterprises are built with "loans" and technical equipment provided by the World Bank, which is dominated by the United States. The three steel plants of India's largest "state-owned" enterprise, Hindustan Steel, each with an annual production capacity of 100 million tons of steel, were built respectively by Britain, West Germany, and the Soviet Union. The construction of these enterprises provided a market for imperialism and the Soviet revisionists to export capital, technology, and equipment, deepening imperialist and revisionist control over India.

The development of Indian bureaucratic comprador capital is making the broad masses of the Indian people suffer from the ruthless exploitation of imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique. According to Indian newspapers, this year, India's debt repayment principal and interest amounted to more than 30 billion rupees, accounting for more than 40% of India's total export trade volume in the 1966-1967 fiscal year. This means that imperialism and revisionism have taken away nearly half of India's export products.

In 1958, U.S. imperialism, through the World Bank it controls, organized a so-called "India Aid Club" with Britain, West Germany, Japan, and Canada, becoming the overlord of India's economy. Even the mouthpiece of the Indian big bourgeoisie, the weekly "Link," had to admit: "The World Bank's control over the Indian economy is no longer limited to reviewing specific projects for aid; it has been rampant in the entire field of India's economic planning."

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's "aid" to India in building "state-owned" enterprises is also for the purpose of plundering and enslaving the Indian people. The Soviet revisionists' methods are no different from those of the American neocolonialists. A considerable part of India's heavy industry, including a quarter of steel smelting, half of oil refining, and a fifth of electricity, are already under the control of the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists and their lackeys in India shamelessly praise the "progressiveness" of Indian "state-owned" enterprises and play up the tune of the conflict between the "state-owned" sector and the private sector. However, the facts prove that the Indian bureaucratic capital cultivated by Nehru and his successors mainly serves private monopoly capital and a small number of bureaucratic privileged classes. The main business of India's "state-owned" financial institutions is to provide loans to private monopoly capital and to guarantee loans from private monopoly capital to foreign countries.

Indian bureaucratic capital is so closely linked with private monopoly capital that some Indian monopoly capitalists themselves are responsible for "state-owned" enterprises. Indian government ministers are agents of monopoly capitalists. For example, Birla not only participates in the decision-making and advisory bodies of the "national plan" but also directly serves as the director of important "state-owned" enterprises. Another head of Indian monopoly capital, Tata, serves as the chairman of the board of directors of the Indian "state-owned" international airline company. The current Minister of State for Finance, K.C. Pant, was a director of the Birla Company before becoming a minister. At the same time, a large number of "state-owned" enterprises, in the form of "joint-stock companies," partner with private enterprises, and private monopoly capitalists are shareholders of "state-owned" enterprises.

Indian state monopoly capital and private monopoly capital are also closely linked with feudal princes and landlords. Some feudal princes themselves are directors of large banks.

Comprador feudal state monopoly capitalism has become the economic foundation of the reactionary regime of the Indian National Congress.

    以发展“公营”经济为名依靠美帝苏修残酷压榨人民
    印度官僚资本是压在人民头上的大山
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：十多年来，印度反动政府在所谓建设“社会主义类型的社会”的幌子下，利用反动的国家政权的力量，以发展“公营”经济为名，大力发展国家垄断资本主义——官僚资本主义。目前，印度这种“公营”企业的实收资本，已将近占到印度全部公司实收资本总额的二分之一，成为压在印度人民头上的一座沉重大山。
    印度官僚资本的特点之一，是资本集中，积聚很快。据印度官方统计，从一九五六——五七年度到一九六四——六五年度，八年间，印度“公营”企业由七十四家增加到一百八十三家，实收资本增加近十四倍。当时，这一百八十三家“公营”企业虽只占印度全国合股公司总数的千分之七，但是，它们却占全部公司实收资本总额的百分之四十。
    世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席在总结帝国主义侵略中国的历史时指出：“为了侵略的必要，帝国主义给中国造成了买办制度，造成了官僚资本。”印度的情况也正是这样。
    印度的“公营”企业，大部分都是依赖帝国主义和苏修集团兴建和扩建起来的。例如印度的铁路、港口、水利工程、发电等企业，有许多是由美国支配的世界银行提供的“贷款”和技术装备。印度最大的“公营”企业印度斯坦钢铁公司所属三座年产百万吨钢的钢厂，就是分别靠英国、西德和苏联建立起来的。这些企业的兴建，给帝国主义和苏修集团提供了输出资本、技术、设备的市场，加深了帝、修对印度的控制。
    印度官僚买办资本的发展正在使印度广大人民遭受着帝国主义和苏修集团的残酷剥削。据印度报纸透露，今年印度应偿还外债的本息高达三十亿卢比以上，相当于印度一九六六——一九六七年度出口贸易总额的百分之四十以上，这就等于说，帝、修抢走了印度近一半的出口产品。
    一九五八年，美帝国主义通过它所支配的世界银行纠集了英国、西德、日本和加拿大等国，组织了一个所谓“援印俱乐部”，成了印度经济的太上皇。连印度大资产阶级喉舌《联系》周刊也不得不承认：世界银行对印度经济的控制，已经“不再局限于审查将要给予援助的具体工程项目，它已纵横驰骋于印度的整个经济计划领域”。
    苏修统治集团“援助”印度兴建“公营”企业，同样是为了掠夺和奴役印度人民。苏修的做法和美国新殖民主义者没有两样。印度相当大一部分重工业，包括钢铁冶炼的四分之一，石油提炼的二分之一和电力的五分之一，都已处于苏修的控制之下。
    苏修及其在印度的娄罗们，无耻地吹捧印度“公营”企业的“进步性”，大弹“公营部分”和私营部分矛盾的滥调。但是，事实证明，由尼赫鲁及其继承人培植的印度官僚资本，主要是为私人垄断资本和少数官僚特权阶层效劳的。印度的“公营”金融机构，主要业务就是向私人垄断资本提供贷款，并为私人垄断资本向国外借款提供保证。
    印度官僚资本同私人垄断资本结合得如此密切，一些印度垄断资本家本人就是“公营”企业的负责人，印度政府一些部长就是垄断资本家的代理人。象比拉，就不仅参加“国家计划”的决策和谘询机构的工作，而且直接担任重要“公营”企业的董事。印度垄断资本的另一头目塔塔，则担任印度“公营”国际航空公司的董事长。现任财政部国务部长的K·C·潘特，在当部长前，是比拉公司的董事。同时，大量“公营”企业以“混合股份公司”的形式，同私人合伙，私人垄断资本家就是“公营”企业的股东。
    印度的国家垄断资本、私人垄断资本，还同封建王公、地主阶级密切地结合在一起。一些封建王公本身就是大银行的董事。
    买办的封建的国家垄断资本主义，已成印度国大党反动政权的经济基础。
