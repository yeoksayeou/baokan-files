All poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside across the nation are determined to carry the struggle between the two lines to the end. We will definitely walk the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao!

Meetings and criticism sessions are being held everywhere, linking local realities to a thorough criticism of the series of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 24th, all poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across the nation are continuing to seriously study the important article "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside" published by the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have expressed that they will definitely remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," carry the struggle between the two lines and the two paths in the countryside to the end, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate and develop the socialist collective economy, and build our vast countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past two days, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, from the shores of the East China Sea to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, across our vast land, tens of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have listened to the broadcast of "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside" again and again, read the newspapers publishing this article again and again, and held discussion meetings or criticism sessions. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they link local realities to a thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies of "class struggle extinguished," "exploitation has merit," "developing the rich peasant economy," "four freedoms," "three autonomies and one contract," and "the experience of the Peach Garden." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres feel more and more that the Chinese Khrushchev is detestable and hateful. They have expressed that they will definitely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line deeply and thoroughly, criticize it to the point of stench, and throw it into the dustbin of history!

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the famous Daqing Brigade across the nation have always listened to Chairman Mao's words, engaged in a head-on struggle with the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and achieved one victory after another. The brigade leader Jia Jincai said, "The Chinese Khrushchev has always fiercely opposed the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's revolutionary line, attempting to restore capitalism, which is a heinous crime. Daqing has always followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, always advanced in the struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev, and always grown in the struggle between the two lines in the countryside. 'Only socialism can save China,' we poor and lower-middle peasants of Daqing will forever advance victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Shaoshan People's Commune, the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao, where the red sun rises, have studied this important article with strong class feelings and bitterly denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. They have resolved to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and carry the struggle between the two lines in the countryside to the end.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Hongqi Brigade, Jianshan County, Hainan Island, which was recommended by the great leader Chairman Mao in "The Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," recalled the course of the struggle between the two lines in this brigade. They said, "When the Chinese Khrushchev jumped out to advocate 'three autonomies and one contract,' a small handful of capitalist-roaders and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists actively responded, stirred up trouble, and attempted to dissolve our Hongqi Brigade, divide up the collective property, and eat it up. We poor and lower-middle peasants joined forces and repelled this capitalist wind. Every victory of our Hongqi Brigade is a victory of Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle. We will definitely remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class struggle."

When the article "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside" reached Taoyuan Brigade, Luning Commune, Lufeng County, Hebei Province, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants spread the news and were overjoyed! Wu Chen, the former party branch secretary of Taoyuan Brigade who had suffered severe persecution under the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line, said excitedly at the discussion meeting, "The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to use the bourgeois reactionary line to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, restore capitalism, and make us poor and lower-middle peasants go back on our path and suffer twice. We firmly do not agree! We will definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, take 'struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism' as the key link, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to the end."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of Xipu Brigade, Jianming Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, who were once called the "poor stick commune," recalled their victories in the struggle between the two lines in the countryside and said, "Back then, we 23 poor peasant households, with three donkey legs, started the 'poor stick commune.' In less than three years, we went from poverty to wealth, from three donkey legs to a herd of mules. This is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist path."

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Taiping Brigade, Zhongxing Commune, Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, a Daqing-style model unit, said, "The Chinese Khrushchev advocated developing the rich peasant economy and supported the rich peasants, which is a crime deserving of death."

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Zhuantang Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou City angrily denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's crimes of slashing cooperatives. They said, "The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents once waved the black flag of 'opposing adventurism,' slashing 37 out of our 46 cooperatives in one go. We will definitely settle this account with them! Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we poor and lower-middle peasants quickly reestablished advanced cooperatives, thus rapidly achieving collectivization. They firmly stated that the broad and smooth socialist path, we will definitely walk it! Whoever dares to oppose, we will fight to the end with them!"

Some revolutionary cadres in Anhui Province denounced the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents' heinous crimes of forcibly pushing "responsibility fields" and implementing "contracting production to households" in Anhui's countryside. They said, "If it weren't for our great leader Chairman Mao timely correcting the course, Anhui's countryside would have experienced a great retrogression. We will definitely wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen enemy, and smash their revisionist black goods to pieces."

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Yi and Han ethnic groups in Ala Brigade, Ala Commune, Guandu District, Kunming City said, "After land reform, we followed the path indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao and walked on the socialist road, feeling more and more enlightened. We will definitely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line to the point of stench, so that revisionism will never find soil in our place."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guizhou, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Jiangxi, Henan, Liaoning, and the suburbs of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, combined with their personal experiences, seriously studied the article "The Struggle Between the Two Lines in China's Countryside." They love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more and hate the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line even more. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said well: The socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao is the only bright, liberated, and emancipated path for us poor and lower-middle peasants. The path advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is the path of polarization, the path for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to come to power, the path for poor and lower-middle peasants to suffer twice, the path for the restoration of feudalism and capitalism. If we do not block the Chinese Khrushchev's black path, then laborers will have to be laborers again, beggars will have to hold their begging sticks again, tenants will have to till the land again, and our great motherland will change color. The tens of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants across the nation have most resolutely expressed that they will definitely, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carry the struggle between the two lines and the two paths in the countryside to the end, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to the end!

    全国亿万贫农下中农和农村革命干部决心把两条道路斗争进行到底
    毛主席指引的社会主义大道，我们走定了！
    纷纷举行座谈会或批判会，联系本地实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的一系列反革命修正主义谬论
    据新华社二十四日讯　全国亿万贫下中农和农村革命干部，继续认真学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的重要文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》。广大贫农下中农和革命干部表示，一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，把农村两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，巩固和发展社会主义集体经济，把我国广大农村建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    这两天，从黑龙江到海南岛，从东海之滨到康藏高原，在我国辽阔的国土上，亿万贫下中农和革命干部，一遍又一遍地收听《中国农村两条道路的斗争》的广播，一遍又一遍地阅读刊登这篇文章的报纸，纷纷举行座谈会或批判会。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，联系本地实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“发展富农经济”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“桃园经验”等一系列反革命谬论。广大贫农下中农和革命干部，越批越感到中国赫鲁晓夫可恶可恨。他们表示，一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批深批透，批倒批臭，把它抛到历史的垃圾堆里去！
    全国著名的大寨大队的广大贫下中农，最听毛主席的话，同中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线进行针锋相对的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。这个大队的大队长贾进才说，中国赫鲁晓夫一贯疯狂地反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛主席的革命路线，妄想复辟资本主义，真是罪恶滔天。我们大寨一直是沿着毛主席的革命路线走过来的，一直是在同中国赫鲁晓夫的斗争中前进的，一直是在农村两条道路的斗争中成长的。“只有社会主义能够救中国”，我们大寨贫下中农将永远沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进。
    红太阳升起的地方——我们伟大领袖毛主席的家乡韶山人民公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部学习了这篇重要文章，怀着强烈的阶级感情，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把农村两条道路斗争进行到底。
    伟大领袖毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中推荐过的海南岛琼山县建土桥公社红旗大队的贫下中农和革命干部，回忆了这个大队两条道路斗争的历程。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫跳出来大肆鼓吹“三自一包”时，一小撮走资派和地、富、反、坏、右积极呼应，兴风作浪，妄想解散我们红旗大队，把集体家当分光吃光。我们贫下中农拧成一股绳，击退了这股资本主义妖风。我们红旗大队的每一个胜利，都是毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争理论的胜利。我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，永远念念不忘阶级斗争。
    《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章传到河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队，广大贫下中农奔走相告，高兴极了！曾经遭受中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线残酷迫害的桃园大队原党支部书记吴臣，在座谈会上激动地说，中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用资产阶级反动路线对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，复辟资本主义，让我们贫下中农走回头路，受二遍苦，我们坚决不答应！我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    当年被称为“穷棒子社”的河北省遵化县建明公社西铺大队的广大贫下中农，在回顾他们在农村两条道路斗争中所取得的胜利时说，当年我们二十三户贫农，凭着三条驴腿办起了“穷棒子社”，不到三年，就由穷变富，由三条驴腿变成骡马成群，这是毛主席的革命路线的胜利！我们贫下中农跟着毛主席走社会主义道路走定了！
    黑龙江省的大寨式典型单位——甘南县中兴公社太平大队的贫下中农说，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹发展富农经济，为富农撑腰打气，真是罪该万死。
    杭州市郊转塘公社的贫下中农和革命干部，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社的罪行。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人当年打着“反冒进”的黑旗，曾经把我们这里的四十六个合作社，一下子砍掉了三十七个，这笔账我们一定要同他们算！在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，我们贫下中农很快又办起了高级社，这才迅速实现了合作化。他们坚定地表示，社会主义这条康庄大道，我们走定了！谁胆敢反对，我们就和他拚到底！
    安徽省有些革命干部，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在安徽农村强制推行“责任田”，实行“包产到户”的滔天罪行。他们说，如果不是我们伟大领袖毛主席及时拨正航向，安徽农村就会出现历史的大倒退。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，发扬痛打落水狗的精神，把他们的修正主义黑货通通砸个稀巴烂。
    昆明市官渡区阿拉公社阿拉大队彝、汉两族贫下中农和革命干部说，土改以后，我们沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，走在社会主义的大路上，越走心里越亮堂。我们一定要把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线批倒批臭，让修正主义永远在我们这里找不到土壤。
    湖北、江苏、山东、贵州、青海、内蒙古、四川、新疆、西藏、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、江西、河南、辽宁等地以及北京、上海、天津郊区的广大贫下中农，结合自己的亲身经历，认真学习《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章，他们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线更加仇恨。广大贫下中农说得好：毛主席指引的社会主义道路，是我们贫下中农唯一的光明的路，解放的路，翻身的路，幸福的路。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的那条道路，是两极分化的路，地、富、反、坏、右上台的路，贫下中农受二遍苦的路，封建主义、资本主义复辟的路。如果不把中国赫鲁晓夫这条黑路堵死，那时长工要重当，讨米棒要重拿，佃田要重种，伟大祖国要变色。各地亿万贫下中农最坚决地表示，一定要在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，把农村两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
