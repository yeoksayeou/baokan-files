The Red Sun Shines Brighter in My Heart

	Supporting personnel in Myanmar, Ní Liángchǔ

	Most revered and beloved great leader Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! For so many years, I have thought of you by day and dreamed of you by night. This time, I finally saw you. This is the greatest happiness of my life!

	You waved to us with a smile, so kind and loving! My eyes were filled with tears, my blood boiled, and warm currents flowed through my entire body. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! No matter how many words I use, I cannot express my boundless love and admiration for you!

	Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! Your energy is so abundant, your health is so robust. This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the greatest happiness for all the people of the world! From the bottom of my heart, I wish you a million times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

	Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! I was a cowherd in the old society. It was you who led us, the poor people, to make a revolution, overthrow the "three big mountains" that oppressed the Chinese people, dispelled the dark clouds, and let us see the sun. It was your sunshine and rain that nurtured me, making me a conscious worker and a revolutionary fighter of the proletariat who can serve the people of the world. It was your great thoughts that armed me, giving me unlimited confidence and boundless strength in the struggle against the reactionaries in Myanmar.

	Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! During my work in Myanmar, we always remember your teachings: "The people who have already won the revolution should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." We always remember your teachings, taking extreme responsibility for our work and having extreme enthusiasm for our comrades and the people. The workers of Myanmar were deeply moved and said, "You are the good experts sent by Chairman Mao, our brothers from Myanmar!"

	Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! In the four months of the struggle against violence, we withstood the anti-China waves of the Ne Win reactionary government and were not afraid of the guns and bayonets of the fascist thugs. "Surrounded by the enemy on all sides, I stand firm and unyielding." In the most difficult situations and the most treacherous environments, whenever we thought of your teachings, our bodies were filled with boundless strength. We often recited in our hearts: "Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." We deeply felt that the victory of this struggle against violence is a great victory of your brilliant thoughts.

	Chairman Mao, our brightest red sun in our hearts! You received us in the midst of your busy schedule, which shows that you care most about the people and understand our wishes the best. This is your greatest care for us and also your greatest encouragement. Chairman Mao, red sun! You shine brighter in my heart. Now, I promise you here: I will definitely study and apply your works more diligently, definitely follow your teachings: "Criticize and repudiate revisionism," firmly defend your revolutionary line, achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and resolutely contribute everything I have to support the world revolution!

    红太阳照得我心更亮
    援缅人员　倪良楚
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！多少年来，日里思，梦里想，这回终于见到了您老人家，这是我一生最大最大的幸福！
    您微笑着向我们招手，您是那样的慈祥！我热泪盈眶，热血沸腾，一股股暖流在我全身流淌。毛主席啊，毛主席！千言万语，万语千言也说不尽我对您的无限热爱，无限敬仰！
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！您的精力是那样充沛，身体是那样健康，这是全中国人民的最大幸福，也是全世界人民的最大幸福！我从内心里千万遍地祝愿：毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！我是旧社会里的放牛娃。是您领导我们穷苦人民闹革命，推翻了压在中国人民头上的“三座大山”，驱散了乌云，见了太阳。是您的阳光雨露，哺育了我，使我成为一个有觉悟的工人，成为一个能为世界人民服务的无产阶级革命战士。是您的伟大思想武装了我，使我在同缅甸反动派的斗争中，有无限的信心，有无穷的力量。
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！在缅甸工作期间，我们时时刻刻牢记您的教导：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们时时刻刻牢记您的教导，对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。缅甸工人非常感动地说：
  “你们是毛主席派来的好专家，是我们缅甸人民的亲兄弟！”
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！在四个月的抗暴斗争中，我们顶住了奈温反动政府的反华恶浪，不怕法西斯暴徒的枪口刺刀。“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动。”在最困难的情况下，在最险恶的环境里，我们一想到您老人家的教导，浑身就增添了无穷无尽的力量。我们经常在心中默诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们深深体会到这次抗暴斗争的胜利，就是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！您在万忙之中接见了我们，这是因为您最关心群众，最了解我们的心愿。这是您对我们的最大关怀，也是对我们的最大鞭策。毛主席啊，红太阳！照得我心更亮。现在，我在这里向您保证：我一定要更好地活学活用您的著作，一定要遵照您的教导：“斗私，批修”，坚决捍卫您的革命路线，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功，并且决心为支援世界革命贡献出自己的一切！
