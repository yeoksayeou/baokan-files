The experience of the Mao Zedong Thought study class for the August 18 Revolutionary Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Party, Government, and Mass Organizations has been widely broadcast across the country. They further conducted group discussions to summarize the gains from the previous period of study. Everyone unanimously affirmed that the three-in-one study class, attended by representatives from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres, and PLA leftist support personnel, has many advantages.

First, it facilitates mutual help and learning, promoting collective advancement. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and PLA comrades studying together can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, inspire each other, and promote self-revolution. Whenever there are ideological obstacles, they can seek the PLA's experience, increasing their courage for self-revolution. Those who dare to expose their private thoughts and engage in intense self-criticism are taken as teachers, and everyone learns from them, better achieving self-education among the masses. The three-in-one format for self-criticism yields quick results and significant effects.

Second, it is beneficial for mutual understanding between cadres and the masses, resolving issues, and strengthening relationships. Cadres, PLA, and masses living and studying together, with mutual encouragement, learning, and assistance, use Mao Zedong Thought to unify their understanding, intensely fight against selfishness, and solve all problems. It also helps cultivate class feelings. A representative from a revolutionary mass organization said: "Although we were previously in a superior-subordinate relationship with revolutionary leading cadres, we did not understand each other. Now, studying together, exposing private thoughts together, engaging in self-criticism together, and having heart-to-heart talks, we understand each other, see the strengths of the cadres, and our relationship has improved." "Previously, when cadres made mistakes, there was opposition from the revolutionary faction. We wanted to rely on the cadres but dared not, not knowing the details, fearing this and that. Once our thoughts came into contact, we dared to rely on and liberate the cadres. The cadres' enthusiasm and initiative also increased, and many cadres before and after the study seemed like two different people." Some revolutionary cadres said: "Before coming to study, I prepared to be criticized: to be a target, to be a typical example for criticism. After coming, seeing the revolutionary faction actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively exposing and criticizing private thoughts, I had great hopes for the cadres, which prompted me to expose my erroneous thoughts, receive everyone's help, and gain confidence in correcting my mistakes."

Third, it can promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Through study, exposing private thoughts, and self-criticism, mutual understanding is promoted, the cadres' background is known, and class feelings are established, laying the ideological foundation for the revolutionary three-in-one combination. If study classes are held separately, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres still do not meet, and their thoughts do not clash. The three-in-one study class accelerates the ideological combination, making organizational combination relatively easier. Currently, the study class is brewing a new high tide of further consolidating and developing the great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Fourth, it can learn the good thoughts, good style, and good experiences of the PLA face-to-face. They reflected that in the past, learning from the PLA was more talk than action. Now, living and studying with the PLA, talking heart-to-heart, learning face-to-face, everywhere can be seen and learned. Many representatives from revolutionary mass organizations said: "This way, we can directly learn the PLA's good experiences in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, changing worldviews, and grasping living thoughts, learn the three-eight style, strengthen our organizational discipline, and change our style."

Fifth, it can jointly summarize the experiences and lessons of cadres making mistakes, educating the proletarian revolutionary faction. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses studying together, jointly summarizing experiences and lessons, especially the lessons of cadres making mistakes, have a great educational effect on young people, helping to avoid or reduce mistakes.

Sixth, it can eliminate the officialdom and arrogance of cadres, establishing a new style. The study class is entirely equal, regardless of the rank of the leading cadres, they are all in the ranks, ordinary soldiers. This was not possible in the past. A representative from a revolutionary mass organization said: "In the past, some cadres, with high positions, long-term detachment from the masses, would often put on an official demeanor and scold people. Now it's different; cadres consciously study and live with the masses. The cadres' ideological style has changed, and the masses feel that the cadres are approachable, and the cadres' words are more acceptable."

Seventh, the PLA studying with revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres enhances their sensory understanding of the struggle between the two classes and two lines, further solidifying their resolve to support the left. Some leftist support comrades believe that studying and living with the revolutionary faction deepens their understanding and affection, making their line struggle more concrete, and their resolve to support them greater.

Eighth, studying literature and practicing martial arts, the study class is also an excellent preparation for war. The PLA deeply penetrates the masses, being both students and cultural-military instructors, one person leading many, everyone understanding some military knowledge. This way, if there is external aggression, billions of people can pick up weapons, burying all invading enemies in the vast ocean of people's war.

    三结合的毛泽东思想学习班好得很
    《红旗》杂志记者
    青海省级党政群系统八·一八联委会毛泽东思想学习班的经验在全国广播后，他们进一步通过群众性的座谈，总结前一段的学习收获。大家一致肯定，由革命群众组织的负责人、革命领导干部和解放军支左干部参加的三结合的学习班有很多优越性。
    一，便于互帮互学，共同提高。革命群众、革命干部同解放军同志一起学习，能够取长补短，互相启发，促进自觉革命。一有思想不通，就请解放军介绍经验，自我革命的勇气就增加了。谁亮私亮得好，斗私斗得狠，就以谁为师，向谁学习，更好地做到群众自己教育自己。以三结合形式去斗私，提高快，收效大。
    二，有利于干群之间互相了解，解疙瘩，密切关系。干部和解放军、群众，生活和学习在一起，有促、有学、有帮，用毛泽东思想统一认识，狠斗“私”字，什么问题都好解决，也便于培养阶级感情。革命群众组织负责人说：“同革命领导干部过去虽是上下级关系，但相互不了解，现在一起学习，一起亮私，一起斗私，一起谈心，互相了解，看到了干部的长处，关系也好了。”“过去干部犯了错误，同革命派有对立情绪。我们想靠干部又不敢靠，不知底细，怕这怕那。思想一有了接触，也敢靠、敢解放干部了。干部的积极性主动性也高了，不少干部学习前后，完全象是两个人。”有的革命干部说：“来学习前，作了挨整的准备：当活靶子，做典型批判。来后，看到革命派活学活用毛主席的最新指示，主动亮私斗私，对干部抱有很大希望，促使自己把错误思想亮出来，得到大家的帮助，改正错误的信心也足了。”
    三，可以促进革命的三结合。通过学习，亮私斗私，促进了互相了解，对干部有了底，建立了阶级感情，就为革命的三结合打下了思想基础。如果分头办学习班，革命群众和革命干部，还是互不见面，思想互不交锋。三结合学习班加速了思想上的结合，组织上的结合就比较容易了。现在，学习班里正在酝酿着一个进一步巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合的新高潮。
    四，可以面对面地学到解放军的好思想，好作风，好经验。他们反映，过去学习解放军，在口头上说得多，没有落实，现在同解放军生活在一起，学习在一起，谈心在一起，面对面地学习，处处可以看到，学到。不少的革命群众组织负责人说：“这样可以直接学到解放军活学活用毛主席著作、改造世界观、抓活思想的好经验，学到三八作风，增强我们的组织纪律性，改变我们的作风。”
    五，可以共同总结干部犯错误的经验教训，教育无产阶级革命派。革命干部和革命群众在一起学习，共同总结经验教训，特别是干部犯错误的教训，对青年人教育很大，可以避免重犯错误，或少犯错误。
    六，可以打掉干部的官气，娇气，树立新的作风。学习班一律平等，不管多大的领导干部，都不例外地站在队列之中，都是普通一兵，这是过去办不到的。一个革命群众组织的负责人说：“过去有些干部职位高了，长期脱离群众，动不动就摆官架子，好训人。现在不同了，干部自觉地同群众一块操课，一块生活。干部的思想作风转变了，群众就感到干部可亲，干部说话也爱听了。”
    七，解放军同革命群众、革命干部一起学习，增强了他们对两个阶级、两条路线斗争的感性认识，更坚定了支左的决心。有的支左同志认为，同革命派在一起学习，在一起生活，对他们了解多了，感情深了，对路线斗争的认识具体了，支持他们的决心更大了。
    八，习文又练武，办学习班也是很好的备战。解放军深入到群众中，既是学生又是文武教员，一人带很多人，大家都懂点军事。这样，一旦有了外来侵略，就可以有亿万群众拿起武器，把一切来犯敌人埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
