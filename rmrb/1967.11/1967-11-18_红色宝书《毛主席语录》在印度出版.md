Edition: 1

The beloved Red Treasure Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been published in Hindi by the Tide Bookstore on October 1st. This is a great joy for the Indian people.

The bookstore is also translating "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 1 into Hindi, scheduled to be published in December.

This year has seen the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the Indian people. The Indian revolutionary people have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and are studying his works with great enthusiasm. Many revolutionaries in India are translating "Quotations from Chairman Mao" into various Indian languages. Many of Chairman Mao's brilliant works, such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Rectify the Party Style of Work," "Oppose Liberalism," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Reform Our Study," and Mao's military works, have already been published in various Indian languages.

Currently, the supply of Mao's works translated and published in India cannot meet the demand, and some people who cannot buy them make copies themselves. The Indian revolutionary people praise Mao's books as "the most precious books in the world." They have organized many study groups to learn from Chairman Mao's works and are striving to combine the truths of Mao Zedong Thought with the realities of the Indian revolution. More and more Indian people have come to realize from countless lessons that the path of relying on the masses, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside to seize political power, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, is the only correct path for the Indian revolution. Currently, they are following this path, creating great turmoil for the Indian reactionaries, and striving for their own complete liberation.

    红色宝书《毛主席语录》在印度出版
    印度革命人民如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，努力把毛泽东思想的真理和印度革命的实际结合起来，沿着武装夺取政权的道路，大造印度反动派的反，争取自己的彻底解放。
    新华社十七日讯　新德里消息：全世界人民热爱的红色宝书《毛主席语录》的印地文版，已于十月一日由潮流书店出版。这是印度人民的大喜事。
    这家书店还正在把《毛泽东选集》第一卷翻译成印地文，预定在十二月出版。
    今年是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在印度人民中得到极其广泛传播的一年。印度革命人民无限热爱毛主席，如饥似渴地认真学习毛主席著作。印度很多革命者正在用印度各种不同的文字翻译出版《毛主席语录》。毛主席的许多光辉著作，如《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《反对自由主义》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《反对本本主义》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》、《论人民民主专政》、《改造我们的学习》，以及毛主席的军事著作，都已用印度不同的文字出版。
    目前，在印度翻译出版的毛主席的著作还供不应求，有的人买不到就设法借来自己刻印。印度革命人民把毛主席的书称颂为“世界上最宝贵的书”。他们组织了许多学习毛主席著作的小组，并正在努力把毛泽东思想的真理和印度革命的实际相结合。越来越多的印度人民从无数血的教训中认识到，毛主席指出的依靠群众、建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市这条武装夺取政权的道路，是印度革命唯一正确的道路。当前，他们正沿着这条道路，大造印度反动派的反，争取自己的彻底解放。
