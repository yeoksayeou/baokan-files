Our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, has issued the latest directives for the proletarian educational revolution, which our school's revolutionary teachers and students have enthusiastically responded to and resolutely carried out.

In the past, the broad masses of teachers and students were victims of the revisionist educational line and the old educational system. We deeply feel that the lengthy school system, the cumbersome examinations, and the retention of students due to "failure" are all part of a revisionist educational system, shackles that bind the revolutionary and creative spirit of the youth.

Primary school graduates go to middle school, middle school graduates take the college entrance exam, and college graduates achieve fame and fortune. In the past, this was considered natural and inevitable. Do you want to follow this path? You can. The condition is: good academic performance. This means studying hard, rote learning. Teachers teach for "grades," and students study for "grades," because "grades are everything."

What exactly is an examination?

Listen to what some teachers in our school say: "The teaching syllabus and reference materials are the best feed and the best fodder. Every exam, both teachers and students can't do without them." It turns out that every exam, teachers chew on the syllabus that others have chewed on, and students chew on what the teachers have chewed on. Parrot learning, repetition, repetition, and more repetition! This is the essence of examinations. No wonder some of our classmates say, "The more you study, the more stupid you become, the more you take exams, the more foolish you become."

The old educational system has poisoned how many young people! A female student in our senior year, during her six-year-long school life, to cope with exams, was always busy. In class, she took notes; after class, she copied notes; at home, she memorized notes; during exams, she recalled notes. Every day, she repeated the contents of the textbooks and syllabus. She couldn't participate in national affairs, political activities, or productive labor. As a result, she developed "neurasthenia." This female student's experience is a condemnation of the old educational system.

The Beijing Normal University Teaching Reform Group's ideas on reforming examinations, promotions, and admissions reflect the demands of our revolutionary teachers and students. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's directive to "revolutionize education" and thoroughly reform the old educational system, teaching principles, and methods.

Reforming the old educational system and establishing a new proletarian educational system is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest directives, rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. We firmly believe that the brand-new proletarian educational system established according to the great thought of Mao Zedong will definitely be born in our generation!

		The revolutionary cadres and military training personnel of Kaifeng Institute of Technology are determined to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives on the proletarian educational revolution. They are discussing the teaching reform plan.

    彻底改革旧的考试制度
    北京四十中革命委员会 
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席发出的无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，我校革命师生最热烈地响应，最坚决地贯彻。
    过去，广大师生是修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度的受害者。我们深深感到：漫长的学制，烦琐的考试，以及由于考试“不及格”带来的留级等等，完全是一套修正主义教育制度，是束缚青年革命创造精神的枷锁。
    小学毕业上中学，中学毕业考大学，大学毕业成名成家。这在过去看来是天经地义的。你要沿这条路走下去吗？可以。条件是：学习成绩好。这就必须死读书，读死书。教员为“分数而教”，学生为“分数而学”，因为“有了分数，就有了一切”。
    考试究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    听听我们学校一些教师中流传的话就清楚了。“教学大纲加参考资料，是最肥的草和最好的料，每次考试，教师和学生谁都离不了。”原来，每次考试，教师都是嚼别人教学大纲嚼过的“馍”，学生又嚼教师嚼过的“馍”。生搬硬套，重复，重复，再重复！这就是考试的实质。难怪我们有些同学讲：“越学越蠢，越考越傻。”
    旧教育制度毒害了我们多少青少年啊！我校高三年级有一位女同学，在长达六年的学习生活中，为了应付考试，每天都手忙脚乱，上课记笔记，下课抄笔记，回家背笔记，考试忆笔记，天天重复着课本、教学大纲里的东西。国家大事、政治活动和生产劳动，她都不能参加。结果，得了“神经官能症”。这位女同学的经历，就是对旧教育制度的控诉。
    北京师范大学教改组对改革考试、升留级和招生的设想，反映了我们革命师生的要求。我们坚决遵循毛主席“教育要革命”的教导，彻底改革旧的教育制度、教学方针和方法。
    改革旧的教育制度，建立无产阶级的新的教育制度，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。我们坚决遵照毛主席的最新指示，依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员和革命的工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。我们坚信：按照伟大的毛泽东思想创立起来的崭新的无产阶级的教育制度，一定会在我们这一代诞生！
