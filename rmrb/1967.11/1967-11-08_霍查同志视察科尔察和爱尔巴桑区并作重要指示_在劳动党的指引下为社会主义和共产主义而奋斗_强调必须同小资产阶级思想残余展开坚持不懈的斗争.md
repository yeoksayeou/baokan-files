Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, inspected the Korça and Elbasan regions of Albania from October 30 to November 3, and issued important instructions on many issues. He was warmly welcomed by the local people.

On October 30, Comrade Hoxha, accompanied by Politburo member of the Central Committee, Koço Theodhosi, and the First Secretary of the Korça Regional Committee, Mihallaq Qishti, inspected the "Laci Zheri" Middle School and participated in a mass rally held in Korça City to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the school's establishment. The "Laci Zheri" Middle School is a school in Albania with a rich revolutionary tradition. Comrade Hoxha once studied there. After inspecting the school, Comrade Hoxha wrote in the guestbook, encouraging the teachers and students: "You should cherish the immortal thoughts of Marxism-Leninism of our glorious Party, and under the banner of the Party that forever flies high, advance fearlessly for the great cause of the Party and the people, for socialism and communism, and for the victory of the proletarian revolution throughout the world!"

At the mass rally celebrating the 50th anniversary of the "Laci Zheri" Middle School, Comrade Hoxha spoke amidst thunderous applause and cheers. He said that the Albanian Party of Labour attaches great importance to the education of the youth because the youth are the future of Albania and the future of socialism and communism.

Comrade Hoxha also spoke about the great significance of the Party's consistent emphasis on maintaining close ties with the masses, listening to the voices of the masses, and fighting against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois remnants in people's minds. He stressed that Party members should take the lead in implementing the Party's instructions and line, setting an example of loyalty and self-sacrifice.

In his speech, Comrade Hoxha also discussed the great prospects in all aspects of life in Albania and the current international situation.

On October 31, Comrade Hoxha visited the "Utavari Semeli" Eight-Year School. Comrade Hoxha instructed the students to study harder with revolutionary spirit as the Party teaches, to love the people and the Party, and to become talented individuals in all aspects.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out to the students the importance of military arts courses, so that students can use weapons after graduating from middle school.

Comrade Hoxha told the teachers that the revolutionary teachers of our country should follow the Party's teachings, strive to educate the youth to be active, positive, and hardworking, and loving of learning and labor, rather than the lifeless youth that bourgeois educational principles demand, who obey all incorrect thoughts and demands. Comrade Hoxha said that the Party has always and will always educate teachers to be political workers first. Therefore, regardless of which subject they teach, they should first consider educating the younger generation with the Party's doctrine and lofty revolutionary spirit.

Comrade Hoxha then inspected the "Semistoli Gjermanji" Twelve-Year School. Comrade Hoxha encouraged the young men and women of this school, saying that the younger generation should be strong and tempered in thought, politics, culture, and military affairs.

On November 1, Comrade Hoxha inspected the Korça Glass Factory. In his speech, he instructed the factory's leading cadres to learn a skill in the units they lead and work in. He instructed the leaders of the trade union organizations to produce with the workers, understand their problems and needs.

Comrade Hoxha also discussed with some female workers the issue of involving more women in various fields of national life.

On November 2, Comrade Hoxha inspected the "Malic November 8" State Farm. Comrade Hoxha praised the achievements of the farm workers and cadres in various aspects. He pointed out that farm workers should be tempered in thought, master the Party's policies, and at the same time, wage a persistent struggle against the petty-bourgeois remnants in their own minds, to become advanced, brave, and unyielding workers against the enemy.

On November 3, Comrade Hoxha, accompanied by the First Secretary of the Elbasan Regional Committee of the Party of Labour, Jashar Mëzeqari, and the Chairman of the Regional People's Assembly Executive Committee, Muftar Grabocka, inspected the Shkëndija Agricultural Production Cooperative in Elbasan.

That morning, Comrade Hoxha attended a mass rally with more than 2,000 participants held in front of the management committee of the agricultural cooperative, and spoke amidst thunderous applause.

Comrade Hoxha also presented the red flag of the Sixth Congress of the Albanian Women's Union to the women's organization of the Shkëndija Cooperative at the rally, congratulating them on their victories and encouraging them to achieve greater successes in their efforts to further liberate women.

Comrade Hoxha returned to Tirana in the afternoon of the same day.

    在庆祝“拉奇·齐里奇”中学成立五十周年的群众大会上，霍查同志在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中讲了话。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党非常重视青年的教育，因为青年是阿尔巴尼亚的未来，是社会主义和共产主义的未来。
