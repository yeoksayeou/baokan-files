In the third anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's declaration "Support the Congolese (Kinshasa) People in Their Struggle Against U.S. Aggression," revolutionary people and national liberation organizations in Africa are enthusiastically celebrating this historic document.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on November 28, the Congolese (Brazzaville) friend Bu Kabeya told a Xinhua reporter: "The great helmsman of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, issued this declaration three years ago, which is a truly historic document in the annals of world revolution today." He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao teaches us, 'When dark clouds appear in the sky, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, darkness will soon pass, and dawn is just ahead.' Chairman Mao's teaching shows that the Congolese (Kinshasa) people and other revolutionary people, who love and respect Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit, will surely win." Kabeya emphasized: "The Congolese (Kinshasa) people, supported by 700 million Chinese people and people of other countries, will surely win the people's war against U.S. aggression. Kabeya enthusiastically expressed his wish: "Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader, commander, and helmsman of the Chinese people and oppressed people worldwide! Long live, long live! He shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the great leader of the world's revolutionary people!"

Another Congolese (Brazzaville) friend, Chongu Nongbo, said: "The contemporary Lenin, our highly respected world revolutionary leader Chairman Mao, issued a great historic declaration supporting the struggle of the Congolese (Kinshasa) brothers. This is a weapon provided by the Chinese people for the revolutionary struggle of the African people. Chairman Mao's brilliant declaration proves that Chairman Mao is the true defender of the struggles of the people of all countries." He stressed: "As long as we follow Chairman Mao's declaration, we can fearlessly confront any imperialism and colonialism. The result will be as Chairman Mao predicted, all devils will be destroyed."

The Congolese (Brazzaville) friend De Yosefu said: "Chairman Mao's declaration is a powerful weapon. It is a great encouragement to the revolutionary Congolese (Kinshasa) people in their struggle."

The Equatorial Guinean warrior N Donggo said that Chairman Mao's declaration shows that "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world. The Equatorial Guinean people, who suffer under imperialist rule, regard this declaration as one made for themselves. The Equatorial Guinean people firmly believe that the Congolese (Kinshasa) people will surely achieve final victory."

The Angolan warrior M Rigobert said that Chairman Mao's declaration is a guide for the Congolese (Kinshasa) people in their struggle for true liberation and a beacon for the Angolan people who are fighting. He emphasized: "Chairman Mao is our guiding star in the night. With this bright star, we can advance steadily in the dark."

The Cameroonian warrior F Kalubi said: Chairman Mao's declaration provides spiritual weapons for the Congolese (Kinshasa) people and revolutionary people worldwide. It is ironclad support for all revolutionary people, especially the Congolese (Kinshasa) people. It is a torch lighting the way for the revolutionary struggles of people worldwide.

In Cairo, many representatives of African nationalist organizations issued statements emphasizing the great significance of Chairman Mao's declaration three years ago in promoting the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people.

The representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, Nimrod Sejak, stated in his declaration that every word and sentence in Chairman Mao's declaration greatly encourages the Congolese (Kinshasa) people to wage a heroic revolutionary armed struggle against imperialism led by the United States.

Sejak said: In the declaration, Chairman Mao pointed out that the U.S. imperialist armed aggression against the Congolese (Kinshasa) "is not only to control the Congo but also to throw the entire African continent, especially the newly independent African countries, back into the net of U.S. neo-colonialism." Chairman Mao's argument provides rich lessons for the African people, encouraging them to determine to advance unyieldingly in the long struggle until imperialism is eliminated.

The representative of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Cairo, Fernande, also issued a statement supporting Chairman Mao's call in the declaration: "People of the world, unite and dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then, the world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

The chief representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee in Cairo, Xisolu, stated in his declaration: In the three years since Chairman Mao's declaration was issued, "the Congolese people's struggle for complete freedom is ongoing." The declaration emphasizes the need for a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism. The declaration concludes with the slogans: "People of the world, unite to oppose imperialism led by the United States! Down with Soviet modern revisionism! Advance towards the thorough liberation of the oppressed people! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

    非洲革命人民欢呼毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年
    毛主席声明照亮世界人民革命道路
    紧跟毛主席世界革命就能赢得胜利
    据新华社二十八日讯　在全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年的时候，非洲革命人民和民族主义组织热烈欢呼毛主席的这一具有伟大历史意义的文献。
    刚果（布）朋友布·卡贝雅对新华社记者说：全世界革命人民的伟大舵手毛主席在三年前发表的声明是“今天世界革命历史上真正具有历史意义的文献。”他说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席教导我们，‘当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。’毛主席的这一教导指出了无限热爱、无限崇敬毛主席和毛泽东思想的战斗中的刚果（金）人民和其他革命人民必定胜利。”卡贝雅强调说：得到七亿中国人民和其它各国人民支持的刚果（金）人民，必将赢得抗击美国侵略的人民战争的胜利。卡贝雅热情地表示“祝愿中国人民和全世界被压迫人民的伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”他高呼：“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”
    另一位刚果（布）朋友钟古·农博说：“当代的列宁、我们的具有崇高威望的世界革命领袖毛主席支持刚果（金）兄弟的斗争的伟大历史性声明，是中国人民给非洲人民革命斗争提供的武器。毛主席的光辉声明证明了毛主席是世界各国人民斗争的真正捍卫者。”他强调说：“只要紧跟毛主席的声明，我们就能永远无所畏惧地对付任何帝国主义和殖民主义。”结果必然象毛主席所断言的那样，一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。
    刚果（布）朋友德·约瑟说：“毛主席的这一声明是一个强有力的武器，它是对斗争中的革命的刚果（金）人民的巨大鼓舞。”
    赤道几内亚的战士恩·东戈说，毛主席的声明表明“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界所有革命人民的伟大领袖。同样遭受帝国主义统治之苦的赤道几内亚人民把这个声明看作是为他们自己发表的。赤道几内亚人民深信刚果（金）人民一定会取得最后胜利。”
    安哥拉战士姆·里戈贝尔说，毛主席的声明，是刚果（金）人民争取真正解放的正义斗争的指南，同时，也是正在进行斗争的安哥拉人民的灯塔。他强调指出：“毛主席是我们黑夜中的指路明星，有了这颗明亮的星，我们就能在黑夜中稳步前进。”
    喀麦隆战士弗·卡吕比说：毛主席的声明给予斗争中的刚果（金）人民和全世界革命人民以精神武器，是对一切革命人民、特别是刚果（金）人民的钢铁般的支持，是照亮全世界革命人民斗争道路的火炬。
    在开罗，许多非洲民族主义组织代表纷纷发表声明，强调毛主席三年前发表的声明，对促进非洲人民反帝斗争的巨大意义。
    南非泛非主义者大会代表尼姆罗德·塞贾克在声明中指出，毛主席声明中的每一字、每一句都极大地鼓舞着刚果（金）人民开展反对以美国为首的帝国主义的英勇革命武装斗争。
    塞贾克说：毛主席在声明中指出，美帝国主义武装侵略刚果（金），“不仅在于控制刚果，而且要把整个非洲，特别是新独立的非洲国家，重新投入美国新殖民主义的罗网。”毛主席这一论断给非洲人民以丰富的教益，促使非洲人民下定决心，不屈不挠，在长期斗争中前进，直到消灭帝国主义。
    争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟驻开罗代表费南德也发表声明，支持毛主席在声明中提出的号召：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会驻开罗首席代表西索尔在声明中指出：在毛主席声明发表后的三年中，“刚果人民争取完全自由的斗争正在进行”。声明强调必须同美帝国主义作坚决的斗争。声明最后高呼：“世界各国人民团结起来反对以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“朝着被压迫人民的彻底解放前进！”“毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”
