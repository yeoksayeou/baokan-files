Burmese workers break through military and police blockade to enthusiastically bid farewell to Chinese experts

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 4th, Yangon news: Burmese workers and the masses are strongly indignant at the reactionary government of Nay Win's unilateral abrogation of the economic and technological cooperation agreement between China and Burma and the expulsion of Chinese experts. They have expressed their concern and friendly sentiments towards the Chinese experts in various ways. This shows that the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is unbreakable by any reactionary forces.

Many Burmese workers often ask translators and cooks working for the Chinese experts to convey their greetings and request photographs as souvenirs. The Burmese people also show great concern for the Chinese experts. Currently, due to shortages in Burma, it is difficult to buy vegetables in the market, but some vegetable vendors always set aside some vegetables for the Chinese experts to express their goodwill. Some Burmese people, after seeing anti-China articles and cartoons in Burmese newspapers, angrily told the Chinese experts, "Nay Win is rotten to the core!" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

When the Chinese experts celebrated the 1967 National Day of China at the construction site, a large number of Burmese workers, despite the danger, broke through the military and police blockade to join the Chinese experts in the celebration. They expressed their love for Chairman Mao to the experts and enthusiastically praised the excellent style of work of the Chinese experts. They said, "The Burmese people have unlimited love for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is your great leader and also our great leader. You are the good experts sent by Chairman Mao. We can learn from your excellent examples about Chairman Mao's boundless concern for the peoples of the world." They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma!" They also sang songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations together with the Chinese experts.

Two days before the Chinese experts left the construction site, the reactionary government of Burma increased the number of troops, police, and secret agents around the experts' residence, tightening the blockade on the experts' residence and control over Burmese workers. However, many Burmese workers found ways to bid farewell to the Chinese experts and wish them a safe journey. On the eve of the Chinese experts' departure from a certain construction site, Burmese workers lined up at the door of the experts' dining hall to shake hands and say goodbye, and wished Chairman Mao a long life. Many Burmese workers fearlessly entered the Chinese experts' residence to visit them. Others, taking advantage of helping the experts prepare for their departure, warmly bid farewell to the Chinese experts. Some workers said, "The Chinese experts are being forced out by Nay Win. Only a small group of people are against China. Nay Win is driving you away, but the Burmese people are united with you in spirit. We will never forget you in our hearts. The Chinese people and the Burmese people will always be friendly. No one in the world can destroy our fraternal friendship." They reluctantly hugged the Chinese experts tightly.

Many Burmese workers asked the Chinese experts for Chairman Mao badges. They said that whenever they missed Chairman Mao and the Chinese experts, they would look at the Chairman Mao badges.

On the day of the experts' departure, the Burmese military and police imposed a curfew on the construction site. The Burmese reactionaries did not allow Burmese workers to go to see off the Chinese experts, nor did they allow them to pay their respects. Even in such circumstances, some Burmese workers broke through the blockade to come and bid farewell to the experts. Before dawn, a Burmese worker bypassed the military and police to the Chinese experts' dormitory, which was heavily surrounded by barbed wire, to say goodbye. He said that he represented the vast majority of workers to wish the Chinese experts a safe journey. When the Chinese experts left the dormitory for the train station, Burmese workers, despite the threats from the military and police, stood by the experts' dormitory door, on the roofs of their houses, or on nearby hills, waving enthusiastically to the Chinese experts.

    “奈温把你们赶走，但是缅甸人民同你们心连心”
    缅甸工人冲破军警封锁热情送别中国专家
    据新华社四日讯　仰光消息：缅甸工人和广大群众对奈温反动政府片面撕毁中缅两国经济技术合作协定、驱逐中国专家的蛮横行径感到强烈的愤慨，他们通过各种方式向中国专家表达他们的关怀和友好的情谊。这表明缅中两国人民的友谊是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。
    许多缅甸工人常常要求为中国专家工作的翻译和厨师代他们向中国专家问好，向中国专家索取照片留作纪念。缅甸的广大人民群众，也对中国专家非常关心。缅甸目前由于供应不足，在市场上不容易买到蔬菜，但是，有些菜贩总是特意为中国专家留下一些蔬菜，表示他们的心意。一些缅甸人民在缅甸报纸上看到反华文章和漫画之后，就愤慨地对中国专家说：“奈温坏透了！”并且高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    当中国专家在工地上庆祝一九六七年中国国庆节时，大批缅甸工人不顾危险，冲破军警的封锁线，同中国专家一起参加庆祝活动。他们向专家表示他们对毛主席的热爱，并且热烈赞扬中国专家的优良作风。他们说：“缅甸人民无限热爱毛主席。毛主席是你们的伟大领袖，也是我们的伟大领袖。”“你们是毛主席派来的好专家。我们能够从你们作出的卓越榜样，了解到毛主席对世界各国人民的无限关怀。”他们高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中缅人民友谊万岁！”他们还同中国专家一起唱毛主席语录歌。
    在中国专家离开工地的前两天，缅甸反动政府在中国专家住处周围，增派了大量的军队、警察和特务，对专家住处的封锁，对缅甸工人的控制都更严了。但是，许多缅甸工人想方设法同中国专家告别，祝中国专家一路平安。某个工地的缅甸工人在中国专家离开的前夕，排列在专家的餐厅门口，同专家握手告别，并且祝毛主席万寿无疆。不少缅甸工人毫不畏惧地进入中国专家的住所，探望他们。另外有些人利用帮助专家做动身准备的机会，热情地同中国专家道别。有的工人说：“中国专家完全是被奈温逼走的。”“反对中国的只是一小撮人。奈温把你们赶走，但是缅甸人民同你们心连心。我们心里决不会忘掉你们。中国人民和缅甸人民将永远友好相处。世界上没有人能破坏我们的胞波友谊。”“中国专家同我们一起劳动，一起生活，同甘苦共患难，正象我们的知心朋友一样。现在你们要离开我们了。这正象一家人要分开一样。我们心里很难过。我们将把奈温赶走中国专家和技术人员，撕毁中缅经济技术合作协定的真相告诉其他的人。”他们依依不舍地同中国专家紧紧拥抱。
    好些缅甸工人向中国专家索取毛主席像章。他们说，每当他们想念毛主席和中国专家的时候，他们就看看毛主席像章。
    在专家离开的当天，缅甸军警在工地实行戒严。缅甸反动派不准缅甸工人去给中国专家送行，甚至不准向专家致意。即使在这种情况下，仍然有些缅甸工人冲破封锁前来向专家告别。天还没有亮，一位缅甸工人绕过军警来到被铁丝网重重包围的中国专家宿舍外面，向中国专家道别。他说，他代表绝大部分的工人祝中国专家一路平安。当中国专家离开宿舍去火车站时，缅甸工人们不顾军警的威胁，站在专家宿舍门旁，站在自己的屋顶上，或是站在附近山坡上，向中国专家热情地挥手致意。
