Some Indian progressive publications have published articles exposing and condemning the betrayal of the revolution by the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements, their collusion with the traitorous Danji clique, and calling on the revolutionary members of the Indian Communist Party and the revolutionary people of India to resolutely take up armed revolutionary struggle.

A recent article in the Punjabi-language "Remembrance of Patriots" supporting the Naxalbari peasant movement pointed out that the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements do not support this movement but secretly support the Indian reactionary government's police actions, violent suppression, and atrocities against the peasants.

The article pointed out that although the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements split from the Danji clique into two factions, "they maintain their differences in words, but in reality, they are both vigorously suppressing honest, revolutionary communists. In other words, both sides continue to weaken or expel honest, revolutionary communists from the party, attempting to prevent genuine communists from forming parties or groups to oppose them, thoroughly exposing their revisionist faces or pro-Congress tendencies, and opposing their enthusiasm for the parliamentary road."

The article said that revisionists like Nambudiripad have already exposed their true colors. Their hostility and betrayal of the workers' and peasants' revolutionary movements have been fully revealed. The article said: "In the last general election, they mobilized party members and reached unprincipled electoral agreements with other parties to secure some seats in the legislative bodies and parliaments of some states, and shouted for the overthrow of the Congress Party government through voting. However, in Kerala, they are begging the central government to send rice there; in West Bengal, the revolutionary peasant movement has struck the correct targets and forced their class enemies to flee, but those leaders are attacking this peasant movement, defaming and slandering it, labeling the leaders of this movement as extremists, adventurists, etc., and asking the government to take police action against them, thus opening the door to the suppression of the just struggle of the Naxalbari peasants."

The article finally emphasized that the Naxalbari peasant movement and the government's suppression of it "have made the Indian people see through people's true colors in this major struggle, seeing who their friends are and who their enemies are."

An article in the August issue of the Indian magazine "People's Path" supporting the Naxalbari peasant movement condemned the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements for siding with the exploiters and landlords, suppressing the genuine demands of the peasants.

The article pointed out that the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements did not initially recognize the local leadership bodies that launched the peasant liberation movement and later justified the police actions. They "announced the expulsion of some leaders who sympathized with the Naxalbari peasants, which is quite surprising."

The article said that after the "Fourth General Election" in India at the beginning of this year, the Indian Communist Party's revisionist elements "have been particularly eager to compete with others for positions and privileged jobs in the political institutions of the bourgeoisie and landlords. Even in the places where they control the government, they have not been able to distinguish their actions from those of the Congress Party government. Those state machines, bureaucratic institutions, and police have treated the people with the same contempt as under the rule of the Congress Party government. They have become tools in the hands of the bourgeoisie and landlords and represent them in exercising power."

The article said: "It is exciting that within the Indian Communist Party, 'some people refuse to compromise with the betrayal of the people's movement and stand up to publicly clash with the ruling leaders.... When those ruling leaders betray a movement, those cadres have no choice but to rebel.'"

The article expressed the hope that the broad masses of the Indian Communist Party would rise up against the revisionists, "either by abandoning the opportunist leadership clique and putting the party in the hands of genuine revolutionaries; or by breaking away from the control of the new revisionists and uniting in a truly revolutionary party." The article pointed out that the time for making such a decision has matured.

    印度进步刊物谴责印修分子热衷于议会道路同叛徒丹吉集团同流合污
    号召印度革命人民起来进行武装斗争
    据新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：一些印度进步刊物发表文章，揭露和谴责印共修正主义分子背叛革命，同叛徒丹吉集团同流合污，并且号召印共要革命的党员和印度革命人民起来坚决进行革命的武装斗争。
    旁遮普文的《回忆爱国者报》不久以前发表的一篇表示支持纳萨尔巴里的农民运动的文章指出，印共修正主义分子不支持这个运动，而暗中支持印度反动政府对农民采取警察行动，进行武力镇压和采取暴行。
    文章指出，尽管印共修正主义分子同丹吉集团分裂为两派，“他们在口头上保持彼此之间的分歧，但是实际上他们都在起劲地镇压正直的、革命的共产党员。换句话说，双方都继续坚持从党内削弱或排除正直的、革命的共产党员，企图使真正的共产党员不去组成政党或小组来反对他们，彻底揭露他们的修正主义面目或亲国大党的倾向并反对他们热衷于议会道路。”
    文章说，南布迪里巴德等印共修正主义分子已经暴露出他们的真面目。他们对工农革命运动的敌视和叛卖也暴露无遗。文章说：“在上次大选中，他们通过动员党员群众以及同其他政党达成无原则的选举协议的办法，在一些邦的立法机构和议会中搞到一些席位，并且叫嚷要通过投票选举来推翻国大党政权。但是实际上，在喀拉拉，他们正在恳求中央政府往那里赶运大米；在西孟加拉，革命的农民运动打击了正确的目标并且迫使他们的阶级敌人逃跑，而那些领导人却打击这个农民运动，诋毁和诽谤它，攻击这个运动的领导人是极端主义分子、冒险分子等等，请求政府对他们采取警察行动，从而为镇压正义斗争的纳萨尔巴里农民打开了大门。”
    文章最后强调说，纳萨尔巴里农民运动以及政府对它的镇压“使印度人民在这场重大的斗争中看清人们的真面目，看清谁是他们的朋友，谁是他们的敌人”。
    印度《人民之路》月刊八月号刊载的一篇支持纳萨尔巴里的农民运动的文章，谴责印共修正主义分子同剥削者、地主站在一起，压制农民的真正要求。
    文章指出，印共修正主义分子一开始就不承认那些发动农民解放运动的地方领导机构，后来又为警察行动辩解。他们“宣布开除一些同情纳萨尔巴里的农民的领导人，这是十分令人惊讶的”。
    文章说，在今年初举行的印度“第四届大选”以后，印共修正主义分子“一直十分热衷于同其他一些人在资产阶级和地主的政治机构中抢地位，抢享有特权的职务。甚至在他们控制了政府的地方，他们也没有能够使他们的行动同国大党的行动划清界限。那些国家机器、官僚机构和警察采取同国大党政府统治下一样的轻视的态度去对付人民，它们已经成为资产阶级和地主的国家手中的工具。并且代表他们去行使权力。”
    文章说：令人兴奋的是，在印共内部，“有一部分人拒绝同叛卖人民运动的行为妥协，他们起来公开同处于统治地位的领导人发生冲突。……当那些处于统治地位的领导人背叛了一个运动的时候，那些干部没有别的办法，只有起来造反。”
    文章表示希望印共广大党员起来造修正主义者的反，“或者是他们抛弃机会主义领导集团，把党放在真正的革命者手中；或者是他们摆脱那些新修正主义分子的控制，集合在一个真正革命的党内。”文章指出，作出这样的决定的时机已经成熟了。
