The current situation in the countryside is excellent. Hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants, along with the revolutionary masses in the cities, have been fully mobilized. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they have engaged in self-criticism, criticized revisionism, and significantly raised their socialist consciousness. The great revolutionary movement has brought about a new surge in production, and this year's agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest. The countryside is full of a prosperous and thriving atmosphere.

To further deepen the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside and to eliminate its influence, is a major battle task for the current development of the socialist cultural revolution in the countryside.

China is a country with over 500 million peasants. Whether or not the peasant question can be correctly solved is a key to the success or failure of our democratic revolution, and it is also a key to the success or failure of our socialist revolution. After the nationwide victory, whether to lead the Chinese peasants towards socialism or towards capitalism, determines the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the fate of the socialist system.

It is precisely on this most important issue that, since liberation, there has been a fierce struggle between two roads and two lines.

On the eve of national liberation, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." "Without the socialization of agriculture, there will be no complete and consolidated socialism."

Our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, formulated a Marxist-Leninist line for the socialist revolution in the countryside. This is a line to eliminate capitalist exploitation in the countryside, to achieve the collectivization of agriculture, and to complete the socialist revolution on the agricultural front, guiding the peasants to walk the broad road of socialism.

But what has that greatest capitalist-roader within the Party, the Chinese Khrushchev, done in the field of agriculture over the past decade or so?

Before the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, he vigorously protected and developed the rich peasant economy and opposed the socialist collectivization of agriculture. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, he engaged in capitalist restoration activities, undermined the socialist collective economy, and fiercely sabotaged the socialist revolution in the countryside, opposing the vast poor and lower-middle peasants. He implemented a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist line, which is a line that attempts to achieve capitalist restoration in the countryside, and in fact, the restoration of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

To systematically and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is of great practical significance for adhering to the socialist road, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and uprooting the roots of revisionism.

The Chinese Khrushchev is a fervent advocate of the rich peasant economy

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the basic end of our country's democratic revolution and the beginning of the socialist revolution.

In March 1949, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, Chairman Mao pointed out: "After the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide and the solution of the land problem, the basic contradiction within the country is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The ninety percent of the national economy's total output value, which is composed of the scattered individual agricultural and handicraft economies, can and must be cautiously, gradually, and actively guided towards modernization and collectivization. The idea of letting things take their own course is wrong."

In accordance with Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist thought of uninterrupted revolution, that is, the thought of transforming from the bourgeois democratic revolutionary stage to the proletarian socialist revolutionary stage without interruption, after the land reform, it is necessary to strike while the iron is hot and promptly develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, gradually establish socialist production relations in agriculture, guide the peasants to take the socialist road, and limit and eliminate capitalist tendencies in the countryside.

In sharp contrast to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Chinese Khrushchev, representing the interests of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, immediately jumped out and fervently advocated capitalism, fiercely opposing socialism.

Just over a month after the closure of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, this Chinese Khrushchev rushed to Tianjin and vilely praised capitalists, proposing the infamous "exploitation is meritorious" theory.

Just after the nation was liberated, this Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated the development of the rich peasant economy. In January 1950, in his black "directive" to the great traitor An Zifeng, he rambled on about how "now exploitation is to save people, and not allowing exploitation is dogmatism. Now exploitation is necessary, and exploitation should be welcomed."

He opposed Chairman Mao's point in the report of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that the agricultural and handicraft economies could not be left to their own devices, and sang the opposite tune: "Hiring workers and individual farming should be left to their own devices," "let some rich peasants emerge," and he also propagated that hiring people to farm "should not be restricted," is "legal," and "beneficial to the poor."

He even raved: "In a few years, the number of households with three horses, one plow, and one cart should reach eighty percent."

In his speech in June of the same year, he said, "The policy of preserving the rich peasant economy is a long-term policy."

From these cries of the blood-sucking vampires, we can see the greed and madness of the capitalist forces in the countryside, which want to devour socialism. This is a thorough and thorough bourgeois philosophy of eating people!

What "exploitation saves people"! What "hiring workers is legal"! It "saves" the bourgeoisie, and it "legalizes" capitalism. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party, so fervently praises the exploitation system, describing the evil system of employing and enslaving people as if it were a "paradise." What black goods are in his five viscera and six bowels, is it not clear as day?!

What "developing households with three horses, one plow, and one cart"! Anyone with a little common sense knows that in the vast countryside, households with three horses, one plow, and one cart are not middle peasants, but rich peasants. So-called developing households with three horses, one plow, and one cart is to develop the rich peasant economy, let capitalism occupy the countryside, and make the vast poor and lower-middle peasants fall back into the miserable plight of being oppressed and exploited, destroying the alliance between workers and peasants, and destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat.

What "should not be restricted"! This number one capitalist-roader fervently praises the rich peasant economy precisely to "restrict" and strangle the initiative of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist road, and to clear the way for capitalist forces. He shouts "should not be restricted" only for capitalist exploitation. This is the class content of his so-called "freedom"!

The Chinese Khrushchev, to deceive the masses, actually turned black into white, saying: "With seventy percent of households having three horses, collective farms can be established in the future."

He maliciously slandered the poor peasants: "Do not think that those who oppose individual farming are all collectivists."

This is a great insult to the poor peasants and a great distortion of the socialist collectivization of agriculture! Chairman Mao pointed out: The vast poor and lower-middle peasants have "great socialist enthusiasm." They have been deeply exploited by landlords and rich peasants in the past, and they harbor deep hatred for the exploitation system. After the land reform, although their lives have improved or greatly improved compared to before, many people's economic status is still difficult (poor peasants), or still not rich (lower-middle peasants), which determines that they resolutely oppose individual farming and resolutely oppose the capitalist exploitation system, actively demanding to take the socialist collectivization road. They are the reliance of the Party in the countryside and the main force of the socialist revolution in the countryside. To attack the poor peasants is to attack the revolution and oppose socialism; to rely on the rich peasants to establish "collective farms" will not have a single bit of socialism, but will only be one hundred percent capitalism.

The so-called theory that "only when seventy percent of households have three horses can collective farms be established" is nothing but a fig leaf to cover up naked capitalism. To have seventy or eighty percent of individual farmers become rich peasants is completely a lie, it is absolutely impossible. And everyone knows that when the rich peasant economy controls the countryside, it is the day when "seventy percent" or more of the peasants fall back into the miserable life of poverty under the oppression of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. This is the so-called "benefit" of the Chinese Khrushchev for the "poor."

The Chinese Khrushchev summed up his anti-socialist theories into a program to negate the socialist revolution: "Now we are fighting to consolidate the New Democratic system."

The so-called "consolidation of the New Democratic system" is to maintain the interests of the bourgeoisie and to develop urban and rural capitalism. In the end, it is to drag liberated China back to the old road of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.

This reactionary program was severely criticized by Chairman Mao. In June 1953, Chairman Mao pointed out in a speech that such a proposition is harmful. He profoundly pointed out: The transitional period is full of contradictions and struggles. Our current revolutionary struggle is even more profound than the past armed revolutionary struggle. This is a revolution to thoroughly bury the capitalist system and all exploitation systems. The idea of "establishing a new democratic social order" is not in line with the actual situation of the struggle and hinders the development of the socialist cause.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line thoroughly exposed the reactionary nature of the Chinese Khrushchev's line of developing capitalism and pointed the way for the great socialist revolution. A great socialist revolution, in which tens of millions of peasants participated, began! A more acute and intense struggle between two roads began!

The Chinese Khrushchev is the number one capitalist-roader who strangled agricultural collectivization

The proletarian revolutionary party guides the peasants to take the road of collectivization, which is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and a consistent thought of Chairman Mao. In 1943, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "organize," profoundly pointing out: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, one family one household is a production unit, this scattered individual production is the economic basis of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives."

After national liberation, with the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement entered a new stage.

In 1951, in places like Shanxi, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, proposed to raise the mutual aid teams to try to establish agricultural cooperatives. This was a great revolutionary action. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, behind Chairman Mao's back, viciously wrote on a report: "After the land reform in the countryside, in the economic development, the spontaneous force of the peasants and class differentiation have begun to appear. Some comrades in the Party have already expressed fear of this spontaneous force and class differentiation and are trying to stop or avoid it. They fantasize that by using labor mutual aid teams and supply and marketing cooperatives, they can stop or avoid this trend. Some people have already put forward such opinions: it is necessary to gradually shake, weaken, and even negate the private basis, raise the agricultural production mutual aid organization to the level of agricultural production cooperatives, and use this as a new factor to 'defeat the spontaneous factors of the peasants.' This is an erroneous, dangerous, and utopian socialist thought in agriculture."

Look: This number one capitalist-roader who strangled agricultural collectivization, how much he hates the initiative of the poor and lower-middle peasants to take the socialist road!

The Chinese Khrushchev's "comment" is his confession of opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and his extreme hatred for the vast poor and lower-middle peasants. He actually slandered the socialist line of agricultural collectivization as "fantasy"; he actually slandered the new socialist things that have emerged in real life and broken through the capitalist forces as "dangerous" "utopian." His anti-socialist bourgeois counter-revolutionary stance is here exposed more clearly than ever! We can almost hear his gnashing teeth in hatred of socialism!

Our great leader Chairman Mao, after seeing this comment, with great indignation, resolutely refuted this fallacy. Chairman Mao creatively developed the extremely complete Marxist-Leninist theory on agricultural collectivization under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and personally formulated the first resolution of the Party Central Committee on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, successfully guiding the agricultural collectivization movement forward. The Chinese Khrushchev's plot failed.

In 1953, after the basic restoration of the national economy and the basic completion of the nationwide land reform, Chairman Mao put forward the general line and general task of our Party in the transitional period. He pointed out that some people, after the success of the democratic revolution, still stayed in the old place. They did not understand the change in the nature of the revolution and continued to do their "New Democracy," not to do the socialist transformation. This would lead to rightist errors. As for agriculture, the socialist road is the only road for Chinese agriculture. To develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement and continuously improve agricultural productivity is the center of the Party's work in the countryside.

Under the guidance of the beacon of the general line of the transitional period, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad peasant masses soared to an unprecedented height, and semi-socialist primary agricultural cooperatives sprouted up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, developing rapidly. Faced with this good situation, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his accomplices were frightened and panicked, hurriedly issued orders, shouting "anti-rush," and forced the peasants who had already joined the cooperatives to "withdraw and reorganize." Some newly established primary agricultural cooperatives were thus strangled.

In 1955, under Chairman Mao's great call, the high tide of agricultural collectivization swept across the country. However, the Chinese Khrushchev, taking advantage of Chairman Mao's absence from Beijing, once again planned the criminal "anti-rush" activities. In May of the same year, he and another greatest capitalist-roader within the Party conspired to formulate the reactionary policy of "stop," "shrink," and "rectify," and personally approved the plan to slash cooperatives. In just over two months, 200,000 cooperatives across the country were slashed.

Even now, this Chinese Khrushchev still does not admit his guilt. But the iron-clad evidence is as clear as day, and it cannot be denied. The Chinese Khrushchev's various excuses can only more fully expose his stubborn, reactionary, and evil face.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to find a "theoretical" basis for his opposition to the agricultural collectivization movement, dug out the "theory of productive forces" from the garbage heap of the revisionist trash of his ancestors, Bernstein, Kautsky, Bukharin, and the like. He advocated that "only after the nationalization of industry can large quantities of machinery be supplied to the peasants, and then the nationalization of land and the collectivization of agriculture can be possible."

His "mechanization first, collectivization later" theory has long been shamefully defeated in our agricultural socialist transformation movement. He denies the great revolutionary role of the people as the most important and active factor in the productive forces. In his view, the great promoting role of production relations and superstructure on productive forces, and so on, are all thrown to the clouds. According to his theory, in countries where productive forces are not developed, after the proletariat and poor and lower-middle peasants achieve victory in the democratic revolution, they do not have the right and should not timely transform the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, but must first let capitalism develop. Without machinery, being exploited by capitalists and rich peasants is deserved.

If we really act according to his theory, then we will inevitably sacrifice both the socialist agricultural collectivization of our country and the socialist industrialization.

If we really act according to his theory, will the socialist revolutionary cause not have been sacrificed long ago? Will our proletarian dictatorship state not have long ago become a state of bourgeois dictatorship?

The matter is clear, the so-called "mechanization first, collectivization later" is just an excuse used by the Chinese Khrushchev to oppose the socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist revolution. His evil purpose is to develop capitalism in our countryside, let the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists restore power, and make the vast poor and lower-middle peasants become cattle and horses for the landlords and rich peasants.

At the moment when the agricultural collectivization movement was about to be strangled by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao made the famous report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," and then personally wrote the preface and notes for the book "Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside." In these brilliant, epoch-making great documents, Chairman Mao scientifically, systematically, and completely solved the problem of socialist transformation of agriculture, greatly enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism, and thoroughly smashed the frenzied attacks of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices in theory and practice.

Chairman Mao highly praised the socialist enthusiasm of the vast peasant masses and sang with great enthusiasm: "Now, in the countryside across the country, socialist factors are increasing every day and every hour. The broad peasant masses are eager to organize cooperatives, and a large number of wise, capable, fair, and active leaders have emerged from the masses. This situation is very exciting."

Chairman Mao severely criticized the opportunists who tried to block the historical trend, pointing out in a penetrating way: They are completely "standing on the side of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or rich middle peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies, scheming for a few people."

Chairman Mao profoundly expounded on the dialectical relationship between agricultural collectivization and socialist industrialization, criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's absurd "mechanization first, collectivization later" theory. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Under the conditions of our country (in capitalist countries, it is to make agriculture capitalist), it is necessary to have collectivization first, and then it is possible to use large machinery. 'We should not separate and isolate industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and we should not emphasize one side and weaken the other side."

Chairman Mao's wise judgment solved such a major problem of universal significance: In countries where industry is not developed, after the proletariat leads the democratic revolution to victory, it is possible and necessary to timely transform the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution, rely on the powerful dictatorship of the proletariat, carry out the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, and promote the leapfrog development of social productive forces; in the situation where industry cannot provide a large number of agricultural machinery, it is possible and necessary to mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, first implement the socialist collectivization of agriculture, develop agricultural production, and thus open up a broad road for socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization.

The opportunist evil air went down, and the socialist righteous air rose up. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant theory, tens of millions of peasant households took action, and the great socialist revolutionary tide of tens of millions of peasants quickly washed away the revisionist line of a small handful of demons and ghosts. Their rightist opportunist faces were exposed in the great wave. The great mass movement of agricultural collectivization developed with unprecedented momentum. From the second half of 1955, in just over a year, agricultural collectivization was realized nationwide ahead of schedule, and the socialist transformation of agriculture was basically completed. In the struggle between the two lines, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved a great victory.

The Chinese Khrushchev is the mastermind of the "three freedoms and one contract" black wind

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, the social productive forces of our country have been greatly developed. In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the general line of socialist construction personally formulated by Chairman Mao, the national economy presented a thriving scene of great leaps forward, and a new form of social organization, the people's commune, emerged in the vast countryside of our country. The realization of the people's commune has brought the collectivization of agriculture to a new stage, accelerating the demise of capitalist forces in the countryside.

The class enemies are not reconciled to their defeat and are bitterly hating the new victory of socialism in the countryside, dreaming of restoring capitalism.

Just when our national economy was temporarily facing difficulties due to the sabotage of the Khrushchev traitor clique and three consecutive years of natural disasters, and when imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries launched a chorus of anti-China propaganda, the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, thought that this time they could "change the sky," and thus commanded their big and small lackeys to launch a full-scale, frenzied attack on socialism on all fronts of politics, economy, ideology, and culture.

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party fiercely attacked the people's commune, saying, "The peasants have not benefited from the collective economy in the past few years." Under his incitement, a black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" (free market, private plots, self-responsibility for profits and losses, and contract production to the household) swept through the countryside of our country. This was his attempt to sabotage the people's commune and carry out a capitalist restoration.

He openly shouted: "Do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," "the free market should still be carried out," "in industry, it should be withdrawn enough, and in agriculture, it should also be withdrawn enough, including contract production to the household, individual farming!"

On this point, another greatest capitalist-roader within the Party elaborated more vividly. He said: "As long as it can increase production, individual farming can also be allowed, regardless of whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat."

These two greatest capitalist-roaders within the Party also dispatched their trusted henchmen to go around "investigating" the so-called "experience" of "contract production to the household," trying to gather "ammunition" to attack the proletarian revolutionary line of our great teacher Chairman Mao.

Under the pretext of "increasing production," they actually aimed to sabotage the socialist collective economy, restore individual farming, and let capitalism spread freely in the countryside. This is the reactionary essence of their "three freedoms and one contract."

At that time, to promote the "three freedoms and one contract," the Chinese Khrushchev issued "directives" and made "reports," looking so arrogant! But now, this "well-cultivated" "big shot" shamelessly denies his debt, saying that during the three years of difficulty, he "did not attack" the people's commune.

The facts are clear, and he still wants to deny it. What a shameless face!

The "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev catered to the needs of capitalist forces in the countryside, encouraged the capitalist spontaneous tendencies of wealthy peasants, and opened the green light for speculators and new bourgeois elements. In some places where "contract production to the household" was forcibly implemented according to the black directives of the Chinese Khrushchev, various tricks to restore capitalism, such as "responsibility fields," "dividing land to households," and "production responsibility system," all emerged, seriously affecting and weakening the collective economy.

During the period when the "three freedoms and one contract" black wind blew, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev were all elated, thinking that they had finally found a way to restore capitalism in despair. They shook their heads and said: "When all hope is lost, a new village appears."

All this fully shows that the "three freedoms and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is a black wind that colludes with the capitalist forces in cities and countryside to launch a frenzied attack on the socialist front in the countryside. This is to sabotage the collective economy of the people's commune, undermine the foundations of socialism, and turn red China into black China. This is a capitalist restoration activity to prepare for their usurpation of the Party and the state.

It is no coincidence. The set of tricks played by the greatest capitalist-roader within the Party is exactly the same as the set played by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin in the countryside of the Soviet Union.

The heads of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique vigorously promoted the "principle of free sale of products," ordering the prohibition of "administrative regulation" of market prices. They announced that "the profit level should be the objective basis for evaluating the operational activities of collective farms and state farms." They repeatedly relaxed the restrictions on "private plots," encouraging the division of public land. They vigorously promoted the division of land to groups and households, openly fixing the nationalized land "legally" for group members to cultivate for a long period, and as long as a family had two or three laborers, it could be a group.

It is precisely under the rule of this counter-revolutionary revisionist line that, in the countryside of the Soviet Union, private economy has spread like a plague, the socialist economy has completely collapsed, and the polarization has intensified day by day, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and capitalism has fully restored.

Please think, if the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev were to succeed, what kind of situation would appear in the countryside of our country!

A great struggle around the socialist education movement

Just when the capitalist forces represented by the Chinese Khrushchev were fiercely attacking socialism, in the autumn of 1962, Chairman Mao personally presided over the convening of the historic Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, which had great historical significance. Chairman Mao sharply criticized the rightist opportunist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and stopped the black wind of capitalist restoration that he had stirred up.

At this meeting, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" to the whole Party and the people of the whole country, proposing the great task of "conducting socialist education," and sounding the bugle for the proletariat to counterattack the bourgeoisie on all fronts. It was like a thunderclap, shaking all the ghosts and monsters.

The socialist education movement in the countryside, carried out according to the instructions of Chairman Mao, is a revolution on the ideological and political front, and it is the deepening development of the socialist revolution in the countryside under new historical conditions. Surrounding this great revolutionary mass movement, the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev fought another fierce battle.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is concentrated in two great Marxist-Leninist documents, namely, the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on Several Current Problems in Rural Work" (the Ten Points) personally formulated by Chairman Mao and the "Some Current Problems in the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside" (the Twenty-Three Points).

According to the line of Chairman Mao, it is necessary to "grasp the key of class struggle and the key of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism," to solve the "contradiction between socialism and capitalism."

According to the line of Chairman Mao, it is necessary to "rely on the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and other revolutionaries, pay attention to uniting ninety-five percent of the masses and ninety-five percent of the cadres," and "to carry out sharp, head-on struggles against the capitalist forces and feudal forces that are now fiercely attacking us."

According to the line of Chairman Mao, "the focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." "Those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, some are in the open, and some are behind the scenes." Supporting these people in power, "there are some people who oppose socialism in the commune, district, county, region, and even in the provincial and central departments."

This Marxist-Leninist line touched the sore spot of the greatest capitalist-roader within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and shattered their dream of capitalist restoration. Seeing that the situation was not good, they adopted the counter-revolutionary two-faced method, took over the slogans of the socialist education movement, and threw out a reactionary line that was "left" in form but right in essence.

The first to jump out was another greatest capitalist-roader within the Party. This guy, who has always been in cahoots with the Chinese Khrushchev, opposed the socialist revolution in the countryside. He chopped down cooperatives, advocated "three freedoms and one contract," and this time he did it again. Just four months after the "Ten Points" was issued, he impatiently concocted a "Post-Ten Points" (draft) to directly confront the "Ten Points."

This "Post-Ten Points" (draft) used the counter-revolutionary method of cutting off the root to remove the fundamental content of the struggle between the two classes and two roads, and threw away all the lines, policies, and principles clearly stipulated by Chairman Mao in the "Ten Points." Under the pretext of drawing a clear "policy boundary," it did everything possible to exonerate the responsibility of the capitalist forces in the countryside, tie the hands of the broad masses, and vigorously shield the agents of the bourgeoisie within the Party. He used the name of "socialist education" to direct the struggle spearhead at the poor and lower-middle peasants. Another greatest capitalist-roader within the Party threw out this big poisonous weed, intending to use the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to extinguish the revolutionary flame of the socialist education movement personally ignited by Chairman Mao. This is one of his heinous crimes of opposing socialism and restoring capitalism.

Next, the Chinese Khrushchev dispatched his wife, Wang XX, to "stay in the countryside" and concocted a stinking "Taoyuan experience," shamelessly boasting and self-promoting all over the country, and based on this "experience," revised and modified the "Post-Ten Points" (draft) to produce a "revised draft." This is a representative work of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie that is "left" in form but right in essence, and it is a reactionary program opposing the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

The Chinese Khrushchev threw out this reactionary line of the bourgeoisie that is "left" in form but right in essence, intending to usurp the leadership of the socialist education movement and lead this great revolutionary movement astray. This is a vicious plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to brutally suppress the poor and lower-middle peasants and seize power from the proletariat. In the places and periods under his control, under the poisoning of this "left" but right line, many poor and lower-middle peasants were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and had their power taken away. The great achievements of the socialist education movement under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line were seriously damaged.

The Chinese Khrushchev deliberately avoided the most fundamental issue of the contradiction between socialism and capitalism, talking about the nature of the socialist education movement, such as "the contradiction between the four cleans and the four uncleans," "the intersection of contradictions between the Party and outside the Party, or the intersection of contradictions between the enemy and the people," and so on. He played this "smokescreen," first intending to make the revolutionary people forget the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and forget the dictatorship of the proletariat; second, to direct the spearhead at the vast poor and lower-middle peasants and the vast good and relatively good cadres, to shield the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party from being exposed. This is a very vicious plot.

The Chinese Khrushchev was extremely afraid that the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres would truly rise up, grasp the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the policies of the Party, and would dig out his lackeys. Therefore, he used the Kuomintang's "tutelage" method to suppress the masses, strike at the revolutionary cadres, and make the movement cold and desolate, intending to tightly cover the lid of class struggle and make the socialist education movement "go through the motions."

The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, whether they obliterated the struggle between the two roads or suppressed the masses or struck at the revolutionary cadres, ultimately aimed to muddy the water, confuse the class lines, shift the target of struggle, strike a large area, and protect the capitalist-roaders within the Party and protect themselves.

The reactionary line of the bourgeoisie that is "left" in form but right in essence of the Chinese Khrushchev is a line that puts the socialist education movement on the track of capitalist restoration, and it is a line that undermines the dictatorship of the proletariat and turns the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

As soon as this line was released, it was resisted and opposed by the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. The issuance of the "Twenty-Three Points," a document of great historical significance personally formulated by Chairman Mao, announced the failure of this reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the socialist education movement achieved great results. The capitalist forces in the countryside suffered a heavy blow. The people's commune was further consolidated, and the socialist front in the countryside was further strengthened. The subsequent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution pushed the socialist revolutionary movement in the countryside to a new stage.

With "criticize selfishness and oppose revisionism" as the key, carry the struggle between the two roads in the countryside to the end

The 500 million peasants of our country, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao, have navigated through treacherous waters and overcome evil winds and mists, and have walked along the socialist path for 18 years of glorious struggle.

The 18-year history of the struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside has provided us with extremely rich experience. The most important of these are:

First, "Socialist society is a relatively long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there are still classes, class contradictions, and class struggles, there is the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." In the countryside, because the overthrown landlords and rich peasants are unwilling to perish, they always try to restore power; because there are still bourgeois influences and old social forces in society; because there are spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small producers, therefore, class struggle is always very complex and very sharp, and it is always very intense at every historical turning point. In the issue of the socialist revolution in the countryside, the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev is the concentrated reflection of this struggle within the Party. The vast poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres must persist in the socialist road, must carry out the struggle between the two lines within the Party to the end, and must thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and eliminate its influence.

Second, the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside is, in the end, the struggle between consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the new historical conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the class enemies, in order to achieve their evil purpose of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat, always adopt the methods of corruption, infiltration, division, and dissolution, and look for their agents within the Party. The small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the most important and dangerous enemy of the vast poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev is their backer. His stubbornly pushing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the countryside is an extremely important part of his counter-revolutionary plot to achieve capitalist restoration in China and to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. If we let the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party usurp power, we will have to go back on our path and suffer twice.

Third, after the realization of agricultural collectivization, the socialist revolution on the economic front has not ended. The struggle between consolidating the socialist collective ownership and destroying the socialist collective ownership is still a prominent issue. The "three freedoms and one contract" is an important form of the class enemies' corruption and sabotage of the socialist collective ownership. The proletariat and the poor and lower-middle peasants must use the powerful force of the dictatorship of the proletariat to consolidate and develop the socialist collective ownership and take the road of common prosperity.

Fourth, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants are the social foundation of our socialist construction in the countryside and the reliance of the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the countryside. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to achieve the capitalist restoration in the countryside, always insists on relying on landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and strikes at the poor and lower-middle peasants, the bourgeois class line. We must do the opposite, in the entire historical period of socialism, insist on relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite the middle peasants, and make the power firmly in the hands of those who persist in the socialist road.

Fifth, "The serious problem is to educate the peasants." The basic task of the Party's political work in the countryside is to "continuously instill socialist ideas into the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies." But the Chinese Khrushchev wants to fiercely strike at the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants, vigorously promote material incentives, and strive to induce and utilize spontaneous capitalist tendencies to serve the capitalist restoration. This is a serious struggle to seize the ideological leadership of the peasants. The broad peasant masses and revolutionary cadres must emphasize proletarian politics, insist on Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, and in the process of severely criticizing the revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev, severely struggle against the "selfishness" of the bourgeoisie, and gradually uproot the roots of revisionism.

For 18 years, the Chinese Khrushchev stubbornly adhered to the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, opposed the vast poor and lower-middle peasants, made trouble, failed, made more trouble, failed again, until this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and finally met with complete destruction. His line of opposing the socialist revolution in the countryside has also been swept into the garbage heap of history.

The struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside must be carried out to the end. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the vast countryside must be carried out to the end in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in the countryside of our motherland!

    中国农村两条道路的斗争
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部
    当前农村形势大好。亿万贫农、下中农和城市的广大革命群众一样，充分地发动起来了。他们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，斗私，批修，大大提高了社会主义觉悟。伟大的革命运动带来了生产的新高涨，今年的农业生产获得了大丰收。农村到处是一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    进一步深入地批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒，是当前发展农村无产阶级文化大革命的一个重大的战斗任务。
    中国是一个有着五亿多农民的大国。能不能正确地解决农民问题，是关系我国民主革命成败的关键，又是关系我国社会主义革命成败的关键。在全国胜利以后，把中国农民引向社会主义，还是引向资本主义，决定着无产阶级专政的命运，决定着社会主义制度的命运。
    正是在这样一个头等重大的问题上，解放十几年来，一直存在着两条道路、两条路线的针锋相对的激烈斗争。
    全国解放前夕，我们伟大的领袖毛主席就指出：“严重的问题是教育农民。”“没有农业社会化，就没有全部的巩固的社会主义。”
    我们的伟大舵手毛主席，为农村社会主义革命制定了一条马克思列宁主义的路线。这是一条消灭农村资本主义剥削，实现农业集体化的路线，是一条彻底完成农业战线上的社会主义革命，引导农民走社会主义康庄大道的路线。
    而那个党内最大的走资派，中国的赫鲁晓夫，十几年来在农业问题上又干了些什么呢？
    在农业社会主义改造基本完成以前，他竭力保护和发展富农经济，反对农业的社会主义集体化；在农业社会主义改造基本完成以后，他又大搞资本主义复辟活动，瓦解社会主义集体经济，疯狂地破坏农村的社会主义革命，反对广大贫农、下中农。他推行了一条不折不扣的反革命修正主义路线，这是一条妄图在农村实现资本主义复辟，实际上也就是地、富、反、坏、右复辟的路线。
    用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，系统地、彻底地批判中国赫鲁晓夫这条反革命修正主义路线，对于坚持社会主义道路，巩固无产阶级专政，挖掉修正主义的根子，是有十分重大的现实意义的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是富农经济的狂热鼓吹者
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国民主革命基本结束和社会主义革命的开始。
    一九四九年三月，毛主席在党的七届二中全会的报告中就指出：“中国革命在全国胜利，并且解决了土地问题以后”，国内的基本矛盾就是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。
    毛主席还指出：“占国民经济总产值百分之九十的分散的个体的农业经济和手工业经济，是可能和必须谨慎地、逐步地而又积极地引导它们向着现代化和集体化的方向发展的，任其自流的观点是错误的。”
    按照毛主席这个马克思列宁主义的不断革命的思想，即不间断地由资产阶级民主革命阶段转变到无产阶级社会主义革命阶段的思想，在土地改革以后，必须趁热打铁，及时发展互助合作运动，逐步建立农业中的社会主义生产关系，引导农民走社会主义道路，限制和消灭农村中的资本主义。
    同毛主席这条无产阶级革命路线针锋相对，中国赫鲁晓夫代表了地、富、反、坏、右的利益，立刻跳出来狂热地宣扬资本主义，拚命地反对社会主义。
    七届二中全会闭幕才一个多月，这个中国赫鲁晓夫就跑到天津，卑鄙无耻地吹捧资本家，提出了臭名昭著的“剥削有功”论。
    全国刚刚解放，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫又大力鼓吹发展富农经济。一九五○年一月，他在对大叛徒安子文的黑“指示”中，胡说什么“现在剥削是救人，不准剥削是教条主义，现在必须剥削，要欢迎剥削”。①
    他针对毛主席在七届二中全会报告中提出的对农业经济和手工业经济不能“任其自流”的论点，大唱反调说：“雇工，单干，应该放任自流”，“流出点富农来好”。他还宣传雇人种地“不要限制”②，是“合法的”，“对穷人也是有好处的”③。
    他还疯狂地叫嚷：“三马一犁一车的农户，在数年后应发展到百分之八十”。④
    他在同年六月的讲话中还说，“保存富农经济的政策”，“是一种长期的政策”。⑤
    从这一阵阵吸血鬼的嚎叫中，我们可以看到农村中资本主义势力妄想吞掉社会主义的那种剥削阶级的贪婪和疯狂。这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的吃人哲学！
    什么“剥削是救人”！什么“雇工是合法的”！它“救”的是资产阶级的人，“合”的是资本主义的法。党内头号走资派，如此狂热地歌颂剥削制度，把万恶的雇佣奴役制，描绘得象“极乐世界”一样，他的五脏六腑里装的是什么黑货，不是昭然若揭吗？！
    什么“发展三马一犁一车的农户”！稍有一点常识的人都知道，在广大农村，拥有三马一犁一车的农户，决不是中农，而是富农。所谓发展三马一犁一车的农户，就是要发展富农经济，让资本主义占领农村阵地，使广大贫农、下中农重新沦于被压迫被剥削的悲惨境地，破坏工农联盟，破坏无产阶级专政。
    什么“不要限制”！这个头号走资派狂热地赞美富农经济，正是为了“限制”、扼杀广大贫农、下中农走社会主义道路的积极性，而为资本主义势力鸣锣开道。他叫嚣“不要限制”的仅仅是资本主义剥削而已。这就是他所谓“自由”的阶级内容！
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了欺骗群众，竟然颠倒黑白地说：“有了百分之七十有三匹马的农户，将来才好搞集体农庄。”⑥
    他切齿仇恨地诬蔑贫农：“不要认为反对单干的就都是集体主义者”。⑦
    这是对贫农的莫大污辱，这是对社会主义农业集体化的极大歪曲！毛主席指出：广大贫农、下中农有“极大的社会主义的积极性”。他们过去深受地主、富农的残酷剥削，对剥削制度充满了深仇大恨。土地改革以后，他们的生活虽然比以前有所改善，或者大为改善，但是，许多人的经济地位还很困难（贫农），或者仍然不富裕（下中农），这就决定他们坚决反对单干，坚决反对资本主义剥削制度，积极要求走社会主义集体化的道路。他们是党在农村中的依靠力量，是农村社会主义革命的主力军。打击贫农，就是打击革命，就是反对社会主义；依靠富农去搞什么“集体农庄”，就绝不会有一丝一毫的社会主义，而只能是百分之一百的资本主义。
    所谓要到“有了百分之七十有三匹马的农户”才能搞集体化的荒谬“理论”，不过是替赤裸裸的资本主义剥削加上一块遮羞布而已。要百分之七十、八十的单干农民都变成富农，这完全是骗人的，根本是不可能的。并且谁都知道，富农经济控制农村之日，就是“百分之七十”以上的农民在地、富、反、坏、右的压迫下重新陷于赤贫的痛苦生活之时。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫对“穷人”的所谓“好处”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫把他这套反社会主义的理论，概括成一个否定社会主义革命的纲领：“现在为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”。⑧
    所谓“巩固新民主主义制度”，就是要维护资产阶级的利益，就是要发展城乡资本主义。说到底，也就是要把解放了的中国重新拉回到半殖民地半封建的老路上去。
    这个反动纲领，遭到了毛主席的痛斥。一九五三年六月，毛主席在一次讲话中针锋相对地指出这种提法是有害的。他深刻地指出：过渡时期充满着矛盾和斗争。我们现在的革命斗争，甚至比过去的武装革命斗争还要深刻。这是要把资本主义制度和一切剥削制度彻底埋葬的一场革命。“确立新民主主义社会秩序”的想法，是不符合实际斗争情况的，是妨碍社会主义事业的发展的。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫发展资本主义的路线的反动本质，为伟大的社会主义革命指明了方向。一场几万万农民参加的伟大的社会主义革命开始了！一场更尖锐更剧烈的两条道路的斗争开始了！
    中国赫鲁晓夫是扼杀农业合作化的头号走资派
    无产阶级革命党引导农民走合作化的道路，这是马克思列宁主义的一条基本原理，是毛主席一贯的思想。一九四三年，毛主席就发出了“组织起来”的伟大号召，深刻地指出：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”
    全国解放以后，随着土地改革的完成，在毛主席这条正确路线的指引下，农业互助合作运动提到了一个新的阶段。
    一九五一年，山西等地广大贫农、下中农，根据毛主席的教导，提出把互助组提高一步试办农业合作社的要求。这是一个伟大的革命行动。然而，中国赫鲁晓夫却背着毛主席，在一个报告上恶狠狠地批道：“在土地改革以后的农村中，在经济发展中，农民的自发势力和阶级分化已开始表现出来了。党内已经有一些同志对这种自发势力和阶级分化表示害怕，并且企图去加以阻止或避免。他们幻想用劳动互助组和供销合作社的办法去达到阻止或避免此种趋势的目的。已有人提出了这样的意见：应该逐步地动摇、削弱直至否定私有基础，把农业生产互助组织提高到农业生产合作社，以此作为新因素，去‘战胜农民的自发因素’。这是一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想。”⑨
    请看：这个扼杀农业合作化的头号走资派，是多么仇恨贫农、下中农走社会主义道路的积极性啊！
    中国赫鲁晓夫的这个“批语”，是他反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想、极端仇恨广大贫农、下中农的自供状。他竟敢把农业合作化的社会主义路线，诬蔑为“幻想”；他竟敢把现实生活中冲破资本主义势力而发展起来的社会主义新生事物，诬蔑为“危险”的“空想”。他的反社会主义的资产阶级反革命立场，在这里暴露得再清楚也没有了！我们简直可以听见他咬牙切齿仇恨社会主义的声音！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席看到这个批语以后，以极大的愤慨对这种谬论进行了坚决的回击。毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于在无产阶级专政下实行农业合作化的极其完整的理论，并亲自制定了党中央第一个关于农业生产互助合作的决议，胜利地引导了农业合作化运动向前发展。中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋破产了。
    一九五三年，在国民经济基本恢复和全国土地改革基本完成之后，毛主席提出了我们党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。他指出，有人在民主革命成功以后，仍然停留在原来的地方。他们没有懂得革命性质的转变，还在继续搞他们的“新民主主义”，不去搞社会主义改造。这就要犯右倾的错误。就农业来说，社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路。发展互助合作运动，不断地提高农业生产力，这是党在农村中工作的中心。
    在过渡时期总路线的光辉灯塔照耀下，广大农民的社会主义热情空前高涨，半社会主义性质的初级农业合作社，如雨后春笋，迅速发展。面对这种大好形势，党内头号走资派及其同伙，吓慌了手脚，赶忙下命令，叫喊什么“反冒进”，强迫已入社的农民“退社转组”。一些刚办起的初级农业合作社就这样被扼杀了。
    一九五五年，在毛主席的伟大号召下，农业合作化的高潮遍及全国。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫又趁毛主席不在北京的机会，再次策划了“反冒进”的罪恶活动。同年五月，他和党内另一个最大的走资派合谋制订了“停”、“缩”、“整”的反动方针，并亲自批准了大砍合作社的计划。两个多月的时间，全国就有二十万个合作社被砍掉了。
    直到现在，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫还死不认罪。但是，铁证如山，赖是赖不掉的。中国的赫鲁晓夫百般狡辩，只能更加充分地暴露他顽固不化、恶贯满盈的反动嘴脸。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫为了给他反对农业合作化运动寻找“理论”根据，从他的老祖宗伯恩斯坦、考茨基、布哈林之流的修正主义垃圾堆里翻出了“生产力论”这个破烂武器。他鼓吹什么“有了工业的国有化，才能供给农民大量的机器，然后土地国有化、农业集体化才有可能。”⑩
    他的这种“先机械化，后合作化”的“理论”，在我们的农业社会主义改造运动中早已可耻地破产了。他否认作为生产力中最主要最活跃的因素的人民群众的伟大革命作用。在他那里，生产关系和上层建筑对生产力的伟大促进作用等等，都统统被抛到了九霄云外。按照他的这种“理论”，在生产力还不发达的国家，无产阶级和贫农、下中农取得民主革命胜利以后，没有资格也不应该及时把民主革命转变为社会主义革命，而必须先让资本主义发展。没有机器，受资本家和富农剥削也是活该。
    如果真的按照他的这种“理论”办事，那就必然是既断送我国的社会主义的农业合作化，又断送社会主义工业化。
    如果真的按照他的这种“理论”办事，社会主义革命事业岂不早就被断送，我们无产阶级专政的国家岂不早就变成了资产阶级专政的国家了吗？
    事情很清楚，所谓“先机械化，后合作化”，不过是中国赫鲁晓夫用来反对农业社会主义改造、反对社会主义革命的一个借口。他的罪恶目的，就是要在我国农村发展资本主义，让地、富、反、坏、右复辟，使广大贫农、下中农去给地主、富农当牛做马。
    在农业合作化运动面临被党内头号走资派扼杀的时刻，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，作了《关于农业合作化问题》的著名报告，接着又亲自为《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书写了序言和按语。毛主席在这些天才的、划时代的伟大文献中，科学地、系统地、完整地解决了对农业进行社会主义改造的问题，极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，从理论上和实践上彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的猖狂进攻。
    毛主席高度地赞扬了广大农民的社会主义积极性，以极大的热情歌颂说：“现在全国农村中，社会主义因素每日每时都在增长，广大农民群众要求组织合作社，群众中涌出了大批的聪明、能干、公道、积极的领袖人物，这种情况十分令人兴奋。”
    毛主席痛斥了中国赫鲁晓夫等妄图阻挡历史潮流的机会主义，一针见血地指出：他们完全是“站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意”。
    毛主席深刻地阐明了农业集体化同社会主义工业化的辩证关系，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“先机械化，后合作化”的荒谬“理论”。毛主席指出：“在我国的条件下（在资本主义国家内是使农业资本主义化），则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”
    毛主席的英明论断，解决了这样一个具有普遍意义的重大问题：在工业不发达的国家里，无产阶级领导民主革命取得胜利之后，必须而且可能及时把民主革命转变为社会主义革命，依靠强大的无产阶级专政，实行生产资料所有制的社会主义改造，促进社会生产力的飞跃发展；在工业还不能提供大量的农业机械的情况下，可能而且必须调动广大贫农、下中农的社会主义积极性，先实行农业的社会主义集体化，发展农业生产，从而为社会主义工业化和农业机械化开辟广阔的道路。
    机会主义的邪气垮下去，社会主义的正气升上来。在毛主席的光辉理论的指导下，几千万户的农民群众行动起来了，几万万农民伟大的社会主义革命的怒涛，把中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮妖魔鬼怪的修正主义路线迅速冲垮了，卷走了。他们的右倾机会主义的嘴脸在大浪潮中被照得一清二楚。农业合作化伟大的群众运动，以空前迅猛之势向前发展。从一九五五年下半年起，只经过一年多时间，就在全国提前实现了农业合作化，基本上完成了对农业的社会主义改造。在两条路线斗争中，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线获得了极其伟大的胜利。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是“三自一包”黑风的总根子
    生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，我国社会生产力得到了很大的发展。一九五八年，在毛主席亲自制定的党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，国民经济出现了蓬蓬勃勃的大跃进局面，我国广大农村出现了人民公社这一崭新的社会组织形式。人民公社化的实现，使农业集体化跃进到一个新的阶段，加速了农村资本主义势力的灭亡。
    阶级敌人并不甘心于他们的失败，他们对社会主义在农村的新胜利，恨得咬牙切齿，做梦都在想着复辟资本主义。
    就在我国国民经济由于赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团的破坏和连续三年自然灾害，遇到暂时困难，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起反华大合唱的时候，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，以为这一下可该“变天”了，于是指挥他们的大小娄罗，在政治、经济、思想、文化等各条战线上，向社会主义发起了全面的猖狂进攻。
    党内头号走资派大肆攻击人民公社说，“农民这几年从集体经济中间没有得到好处”?。在他的煽动下，我国农村刮起了一股“三自一包”（自由市场、自留地、自负盈亏、包产到户）的黑风。这是他妄图瓦解人民公社，实行资本主义复辟的一次大表演。
    他公然叫嚣：“不要怕资本主义泛滥”，“自由市场还是要搞下去的”?，“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干！”?
    对这一点，党内另一个最大的走资派发挥得更形象。他说：“只要能增产，单干也可以，不管白猫黑猫，捉住老鼠就是好猫。”
    这两个党内最大的走资派，还派出亲信爪牙，四处“调查”“包产到户”的所谓“经验”，妄图搜罗“炮弹”，攻击我们伟大导师毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    假“增产”之名，行瓦解社会主义集体经济之实，恢复单干，让资本主义在农村自由泛滥，这就是他们提出的“三自一包”的反动实质。
    想当初，为了推行“三自一包”，中国赫鲁晓夫发“指示”，作“报告”，多么神气十足！可是现在，这个“修养”到家的“大人物”却居然厚颜无耻地赖账说，在三年困难时期，他“没有攻击”人民公社。
    事实俱在，还想抵赖。真不要脸！
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”，迎合了农村中资本主义势力的需要，助长了富裕农民的资本主义自发倾向，为投机倒把分子、新生的资产阶级分子大开绿灯。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示强制推行“包产到户”的少数地方，什么“责任田”，什么“分田到户”，什么“产量责任制”等等复辟资本主义的花样，统统冒了出来，严重影响和削弱了集体经济。
    在刮起“三自一包”黑风的一段时间里，中国赫鲁晓夫卵翼下的一小撮的反革命修正主义分子，都得意忘形，以为在绝望之中又终于找到了一条复辟资本主义的妙计。他们摇头晃脑地说：“真是山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村。”
    这一切，都充分说明中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹的“三自一包”，是撮合城乡资本主义势力向农村社会主义阵地发动猖狂进攻的一股黑风。这是为了破坏人民公社集体经济，挖社会主义的墙脚，把红色的中国变为黑色的中国。这是替他们篡党篡政作准备的一场资本主义大复辟活动。
    无独有偶。党内最大的走资派鼓吹的这一套，同赫鲁晓夫及其继任者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流在苏联农村搞的那一套，是一模一样的。
    苏修叛徒集团的头头们大肆推行“产品自由售卖的原则”，下令禁止对市场价格实行“行政调节”。他们宣布“赢利水平应当成为客观上评价集体农庄和国营农场经营活动的基础。”他们一再放宽对“自留地”的限制，纵容私分公有土地。他们大搞分田到组、到户，公然把国有化的土地“从法律上”固定给小组长期耕种，而一家只要有两三个以上的劳动力，就可以是一个小组。
    正是在这样一条反革命修正主义路线的统治下，在苏联的农村，私有经济泛滥成灾，社会主义经济完全瓦解，两极分化日益加剧，富者越富，穷者越穷，资本主义已经全面复辟。
    请同志们想一想，如果让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞，在我国农村，将会出现一种什么样的情景呵！
    围绕社会主义教育运动的一场大搏斗
    正当以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资本主义势力向社会主义猖狂进攻的严重关头，一九六二年秋天，毛主席亲自主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十中全会。毛主席尖锐地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的右倾机会主义路线，煞住了中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的复辟资本主义的黑风。
    在这次会议上，毛主席向全党全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，提出了“要进行社会主义教育”的伟大任务，吹响了无产阶级向资产阶级全面反击的号角。它如一声惊雷，震撼了一切牛鬼蛇神。
    根据毛主席的指示开展起来的农村社会主义教育运动，是一场政治思想战线上的革命，是农村社会主义革命在新的历史条件下的深入发展。围绕着这场伟大的革命群众运动，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线又展开了一场激烈的搏斗。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，集中地体现在两个伟大的马克思列宁主义文件中，这就是毛主席亲自主持制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定》（即十条）和《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》（即二十三条）。
    按照毛主席这条路线，就是要“抓住阶级斗争这个纲，抓住社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这个纲”，解决“社会主义和资本主义的矛盾”。
    按照毛主席这条路线，就是要“依靠工人阶级、贫下中农、革命干部、革命知识分子和其他革命分子，注意团结百分之九十五以上的群众、团结百分之九十五以上的干部”，“向着正在对我们猖狂进攻的资本主义势力和封建势力作尖锐的针锋相对的斗争”。
    按照毛主席这条路线，“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。“那些走资本主义道路的当权派，有在幕前的，有在幕后的。”支持这些当权派的，“在上面的，有在社、区、县、地、甚至有在省和中央部门工作的一些反对搞社会主义的人。”
    这条马克思列宁主义的路线触到了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派的痛处，打破了他们复辟资本主义的美梦。他们见势不妙，就采取反革命的两面手法，把社会主义教育运动的口号接过去，抛出一条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线。
    首先跳出来的，就是党内另一个最大的走资派。这个家伙，一贯和中国赫鲁晓夫狼狈为奸，反对农村社会主义革命。大砍合作社有他，鼓吹“三自一包”有他，这次又有他。伟大的社会主义教育运动的“十条”发布不过四个月，他就急不可耐地炮制出了一个“后十条”（草案），同“十条”直接相对抗。
    这个“后十条”（草案），用反革命釜底抽薪的手法，抽掉了两个阶级、两条道路斗争这一根本内容，把毛主席在“十条”中所明确规定的社会主义教育运动的路线、方针和政策丢得一干二净。它打着要划清“具体的政策界限”的幌子，千方百计地为农村资本主义势力开脱罪责，束缚广大群众的手脚，竭力包庇资产阶级在党内的代理人。他假“社会主义教育”之名，把斗争矛头指向贫农、下中农。党内另一个最大的走资派抛出这棵大毒草，就是妄图用资产阶级反动路线，扑灭由毛主席亲自点燃的社会主义教育运动的革命烈火。这是他反对社会主义、复辟资本主义的滔天罪行之一。
    接着，中国的赫鲁晓夫指派他老婆王××下去“蹲点”，搞了一个臭不可闻的“桃园经验”，恬不知耻地到全国大吹大擂，自卖自夸，并且根据这个“经验”对“后十条”（草案）作了一番加工修改，搞出一个“修正草案”。这是一个形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线的代表作，是反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的反动纲领。
    中国赫鲁晓夫抛出这条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，就是要阴谋篡夺社会主义教育运动的领导权，把这场伟大的革命运动引入歧途。这是中国赫鲁晓夫一场残酷地镇压贫农、下中农，向无产阶级手中夺权的大阴谋。在他操纵的一定地方、一段时期内，在这条形“左”实右路线的毒害下，不少贫农、下中农被打成“反革命”，被夺了权。毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下的社会主义教育运动的伟大成果曾经因此遭到了严重的损害。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力回避社会主义和资本主义的矛盾这个最根本的问题，大谈什么社会主义教育运动的性质，是“四清和四不清的矛盾”，“党内外矛盾的交叉，或者是敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的交叉”等等。他玩弄这种“障眼法”，一是妄图使革命人民忘记无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政；二是为了把矛头指向广大贫农、下中农，指向广大好的和比较好的干部，以包庇党内一小撮走资派不被揭露。这是极其恶毒的阴谋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫极端害怕广大革命群众和革命干部真正发动起来，掌握了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和党的方针政策，就会把他的娄罗挖出来。因此，他拿出国民党的“训政”手段，压制群众，打击革命干部，把运动搞得冷冷清清，妄图把阶级斗争的盖子紧紧盖住，使社会主义教育运动“走过场”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙抹杀两条道路斗争也好，压制群众也好，打击革命干部也好，归根到底，就是要把水搅浑，搞乱阶级阵线，转移斗争目标，打击一大片，以便保护党内的走资派，保护他们自己。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这条形“左”实右的资产阶级反动路线，是一条把社会主义教育运动纳入复辟资本主义轨道的路线，是一条瓦解无产阶级专政，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的路线。
    这条路线一出笼，就受到了广大革命群众、广大革命干部的抵制和反对。毛主席亲自制定的“二十三条”这个具有伟大历史意义的文件的发布，宣告了这条资产阶级反动路线的破产。在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，社会主义教育运动取得了伟大的成果。农村的资本主义势力遭到了沉重的打击。人民公社进一步巩固了，农村的社会主义阵地进一步加强了。接着而来的无产阶级文化大革命，把农村社会主义革命运动又推向一个崭新的阶段。
    以“斗私，批修”为纲，把农村中两条道路的斗争进行到底
    我国五亿农民，紧跟伟大的舵手毛主席，绕过暗礁险滩，战胜妖风迷雾，沿着社会主义的航道走过了十八年光辉的战斗历程。
    十八年来农村两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，给我们提供了极其丰富的经验。其中最重要的是：
    第一、“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”在农村，由于被推翻的地主、富农不甘心于灭亡，总是企图复辟，由于社会上还存在着资产阶级的影响和旧社会的习惯势力，由于存在着小生产者的自发的资本主义倾向，因此，阶级斗争一直是非常复杂、非常尖锐的，在每一个历史的转折关头，总是十分激烈的。在农村社会主义革命问题上，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的斗争，就是这种斗争在党内的集中反映。广大贫农、下中农和革命干部要坚持社会主义道路，必须把党内两条路线的斗争进行到底，必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒。
    第二、革命的根本问题是政权问题。农村两条道路、两条路线的斗争，归根到底，就是巩固无产阶级专政和颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争。在无产阶级专政新的历史条件下，阶级敌人为了达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政的罪恶目的，总是要采取腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，软硬兼施的办法，在党内寻找自己的代理人。党内一小撮走资派，是广大贫农、下中农最主要最危险的敌人。中国赫鲁晓夫是他们的总后台。他在农村顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，是他妄图在中国实现资本主义复辟，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的反革命阴谋的极其重要的组成部分。我们如果让党内一小撮走资派篡夺了政权，那就要走回头路，吃二遍苦。
    第三、在实现农业合作化以后，经济战线上的社会主义革命并没有结束。巩固社会主义的集体所有制同破坏社会主义的集体所有制的斗争，仍然是很突出的一个问题。大搞“三自一包”，就是阶级敌人腐蚀和瓦解社会主义集体所有制的一种重要形式。无产阶级和贫农、下中农必须运用无产阶级专政的强大力量，巩固和发展社会主义集体所有制，走共同富裕的道路。
    第四、广大贫农、下中农，是我们建设社会主义在农村中的社会基础，是在农村中实现无产阶级专政的依靠力量。中国的赫鲁晓夫，为了实现农村的资本主义复辟，总是坚持依靠地、富、反、坏、右，打击贫农、下中农的资产阶级阶级路线。我们必须反其道而行之，在整个社会主义历史时期，坚持依靠贫农、下中农，团结中农的无产阶级的阶级路线，使印把子牢牢地掌握在坚持社会主义道路的人手中。
    第五、“严重的问题是教育农民。”党在农村“政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”。而中国赫鲁晓夫则要拚命打击农民的社会主义积极性，大搞物质刺激，竭力诱发和利用自发的资本主义倾向，为资本主义复辟服务。这是一场争夺对农民的思想领导权的严重斗争。广大农民群众和革命干部，一定要突出无产阶级政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，在狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义的同时，狠斗资产阶级的“私”字，逐步挖掉修正主义的根子。
    十八年来，中国赫鲁晓夫顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，同广大贫农、下中农为敌，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直到这次无产阶级文化大革命，终于遭到了彻底的灭亡。他那一条对抗农村社会主义革命的资产阶级反动路线，也正在被扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    农村中两条道路、两条路线的斗争一定要进行到底。广大农村的无产阶级文化大革命，一定要按照毛主席指出的方向，进行到底。
    让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在祖国的农村高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
