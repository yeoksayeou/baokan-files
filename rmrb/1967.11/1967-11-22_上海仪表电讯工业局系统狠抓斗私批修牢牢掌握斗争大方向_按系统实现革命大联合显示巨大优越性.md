The Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau system has been focusing on struggling against self and criticizing revisionism, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle. By achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system, it has shown tremendous superiority. This has greatly promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination, with about 70% of the grassroots units having established or about to establish revolutionary committees. It has further pushed forward the revolutionary great criticism to be widely and deeply carried out, effectively combining it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the units, and clarifying the direction of reform. It has ensured the implementation of the policy of "grab revolution, promote production," with the revolution being vigorous and production being lively. The total production value for the first three quarters has increased by 10% compared to the same period last year.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 21st, our correspondent's commentary: The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau system, who were the first to achieve revolutionary great alliance within the system, have closely followed the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, with the support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army. Recently, from the bureau and companies to all factories, they have achieved revolutionary great alliance within the system, by department, and by production (administrative) organization.

Over the past ten months, the revolutionary practice of this industry bureau system has shown that achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought has strong vitality and tremendous superiority.

Politically and ideologically, continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance within the system

Why has the revolutionary great alliance within the Shanghai Instrument and Telecommunications Industry Bureau system been able to continuously consolidate and develop? The proletarian revolutionary cadres of this industry bureau system and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army executing the task of supporting the left have three main experiences:

First, firmly grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle and paying full attention to policies and strategies is an important guarantee for achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of this industry bureau system have followed Chairman Mao's teachings. When achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system, they have firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle and paid great attention to policies and strategies, correctly handling various relationship issues, thus ensuring the continuous victory of the revolutionary great alliance.

Firstly, correctly handling the relationship with the grassroots units and revolutionary mass organizations that have not yet joined the system's revolutionary great alliance. For the grassroots units and revolutionary mass organizations that have joined the general liaison station, they have been strongly supported, but without compromising principles. For the grassroots units and revolutionary mass organizations that have not yet joined the general liaison station, they have not been discriminated against or excluded, but have been united, won over, and helped as much as possible. In their work, they have not supported one side and suppressed the other, but have promoted equal consultation and joint action between the two sides. The bureau revolutionary committee and the general liaison station have paid attention to listening to the opinions of the grassroots units and revolutionary mass organizations that have not yet joined the system's revolutionary great alliance, discovering their achievements in work, and actively inviting them to share their experiences at the industry-wide meeting; seeing their shortcomings in work, they have warmly provided individual criticism and help. In this way, these units and organizations have gradually come together in thought, promoting unity.

Secondly, correctly handling the relationship between "vertical" and "horizontal" organizations. When the cross-industry regional organizations, known as "horizontal," achieve revolutionary great alliance within the system, known as "vertical," they have emphasized that adjustments can only be voluntary and not forced. Some grassroots organizations have been obstructed by a few individuals in cross-industry organizations when joining the revolutionary great alliance within the system. The bureau revolutionary committee and the general liaison station have actively contacted those cross-industry organizations and solved problems through consultation based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought.

Thirdly, correctly handling the relationship between the revolutionary cadres of the bureau and the revolutionary cadres of the grassroots factories, consolidating and developing the revolutionary friendship forged in the struggle. The bureau revolutionary committee is composed mainly of revolutionary cadres from the bureau, but also includes representatives from the general liaison station and grassroots revolutionary masses.

Second, taking "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" as the key, politically and ideologically, continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance within the system.

After achieving revolutionary great alliance, the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this industry bureau system immediately focused on two tasks: first, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work and organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes; second, deeply carrying out the revolutionary great criticism and closely combining it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the units.

From early June to late October, the bureau revolutionary committee and the general liaison station organized ten sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 4,300 participants. Whether they had joined the system's revolutionary great alliance or not, everyone participated in the study classes together. Through exposing "self" (revealing thoughts), discussing "self" (talking about the harmfulness of "self"), and breaking "self" (eliminating selfish thoughts), especially by connecting with the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, they have broken "self" and established "public," unified their thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, improved their understanding, eliminated differences, enhanced unity, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. Therefore, each study class has had a positive effect on consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance within the system.

At the same time as the revolutionary great alliance has been continuously consolidating and developing, the revolutionary great criticism has also been widely and deeply carried out. Since April, there have been over 30 industry-wide criticism meetings, strongly exposing and criticizing the revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and his clique. Through the great criticism, everyone has not only further seen the serious problems common to the entire industry, found the root cause of past disagreements and contradictions, but also further understood the importance of uniting against the enemy, thus politically and ideologically consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance within the system.

Third, the People's Liberation Army has actively supported the left, making significant contributions to achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system.

The soldiers of the Navy stationed in Shanghai, executing the task of supporting the left in this industry bureau system, have been firm in their stance and clear in their banner. They have helped the proletarian revolutionary cadres to firmly grasp the four firsts, carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, continuously strengthen ideological and political work, and assist the proletarian revolutionary cadres in eliminating external interference and overcoming the impact of anarchist thoughts, correctly handling various internal contradictions, and firmly advancing along the course indicated by Chairman Mao. They have patiently persuaded and educated the grassroots units and revolutionary mass organizations that have not yet joined the system's revolutionary great alliance, helping them to understand the situation, grasp the direction, and quickly return to their units to participate in the revolutionary great alliance.

The soldiers of the Navy stationed in Shanghai, executing the task of supporting the left, have also taken a measure that is more conducive to promoting the deep development of the Cultural Revolution in the entire industry, based on actual conditions and with the approval of relevant leading organs. This is: establishing a support-left leading group at the bureau level to unify the support-left work of the army in all grassroots factories in the industry; establishing support-left leading groups in the four companies under the bureau to command the PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the factories under the companies. In this way, not only can it meet the needs of achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system, but it can also better promote the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great alliance.

The superiority of achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system has been fully demonstrated

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of this industry bureau system have established a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire industry, continuously consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance within the system, and on this basis, established a bureau revolutionary committee with broad representativeness and proletarian authority. The People's Liberation Army has also unified the support-left work within the system. The three lines have been twisted into one rope, thus making the revolutionary great alliance achieved within the system show tremendous superiority in all aspects.

First, it has greatly promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination. So far, about 70% of the grassroots units have established or are about to establish revolutionary committees.

Second, it has greatly promoted the revolutionary great criticism to be widely and deeply carried out and effectively combined it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the units. Since the revolutionary masses of the industry and units are most familiar with the situation of the industry and units, they have the deepest feelings about the harm caused by the revisionist line to the industry and units. Therefore, in the revolutionary great criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform, they know best what to struggle against, criticize, and reform in the industry and units, and how to struggle, criticize, and reform. Therefore, the revolutionary great criticism in this industry bureau system has been carried out effectively. Through meetings, small meetings, and class criticism, everyone has spoken out and written, not only clearing away the influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all aspects, but also combining the revolutionary great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform, clarifying the direction of reform from the great criticism.

Third, it has ensured the implementation of the policy of "grab revolution, promote production," with the revolution being vigorous and production being lively. The total production value of this industry bureau system for the first three quarters has increased by 10% compared to the same period last year.

In addition, achieving revolutionary great alliance within the system can fully mobilize the masses to help and supervise the cadres and leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations regularly, selecting the outstanding individuals who have been tempered and tested in the revolutionary storms to various leading positions. At the same time, it can rely on the masses of the units and organizations to remove the few bad individuals who have infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations.

    上海仪表电讯工业局系统狠抓斗私批修牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    按系统实现革命大联合显示巨大优越性
    大大促进了革命的三结合，百分之七十左右的基层单位已建立或即将建立革命委员会；进一步推动了革命大批判广泛深入开展，同本单位斗批改真正结合起来，明确了改革方向；保证了抓革命促生产方针的贯彻执行，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，前三个季度的生产总值，比去年同期增长了百分之十。
    据新华社上海二十一日电　本社记者述评：上海第一个按照系统实行革命大联合的仪表电讯工业局系统的无产阶级革命派，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，在人民解放军的支持帮助下，最近从局、公司到所有工厂全部按系统、按部门、按生产（行政）组织实现了革命的大联合。
    十个月来，这个工业局系统的革命实践表明：在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，按照系统实现的革命大联合，具有强大的生命力和巨大的优越性。
    从政治上、思想上不断巩固和发展按照系统的革命大联合
    上海市仪表电讯工业局系统的革命大联合为什么能不断地巩固和发展？这个工业局系统的无产阶级革命派和执行支左任务的人民解放军指战员，主要有三条体会：
    （一）牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，同时充分注意政策和策略，这是按照系统实现革命大联合的重要保证。
    这个工业局系统的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席的教导，在按照系统实现革命大联合的时候，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，同时十分注意政策和策略，正确处理各种关系问题，因而保证了革命大联合不断地胜利发展。
    首先，正确对待和处理同尚未参加这个系统革命大联合的基层单位和革命群众组织之间的关系。对于已经参加总联络站的基层单位和革命群众组织，固然大力支持，但是决不无原则的迁就；对于尚未参加总联络站的基层单位和革命群众组织，不歧视，不排斥，尽可能地团结、争取和帮助。他们在各项工作中，不是支持一方，压制另一方，而是促使双方平等协商，共同行动。局革命委员会和总联络站注意听取尚未参加系统革命大联合的基层单位和革命群众组织的意见，发现他们工作中的成绩，主动邀请他们在全行业大会上介绍经验；看到他们工作中的缺点，热情地进行个别的批评和帮助。这样，就使这些单位和组织，从思想上逐步靠拢，促进了联合。
    其次，正确对待和处理“条条”和“块块”的关系。当跨行业的地区组织，即所谓“块块”，按照系统即所谓“条条”实行革命大联合时，他们强调只能自愿调整，不能强迫命令。有些基层组织在参加按照系统的革命大联合的时候，受到某些跨行业组织中的少数人的阻拦，局革命委员会和总联络站主动跟那些跨行业的组织联系，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上协商解决问题。
    第三，正确对待和处理机关的无产阶级革命派和基层工厂的无产阶级革命派之间的关系，巩固和发展彼此在斗争中结成的革命友谊。局革命委员会既以局机关革命干部为主体，又以总联络站和基层革命群众为基础，吸收他们一定数量的代表参加。
    （二）以“斗私，批修”为纲，从政治上、思想上不断巩固和发展按照系统的革命大联合。
    这个工业局系统的无产阶级革命派实行革命大联合以后，立即抓了两项工作：一是把毛主席著作的大学习放在一切工作的首位，大办毛泽东思想学习班；二是深入开展革命的大批判，并把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。
    局革命委员会和总联络站从六月初到十月底，先后办了十期毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的已达四千三百多人。无论已经参加或尚未参加系统革命大联合的同志，都参加学习班，一道学习。大家通过摆“私”（亮思想），议“私”（大谈“私”字的危害性），破“私”（破除私心杂念），特别是联系两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，用毛泽东思想统一了思想，提高了认识，消除了分歧，增进了团结，加强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性。因此，每一期学习班，对巩固和发展按照系统的革命大联合都产生了积极的效果。
    在革命大联合不断巩固发展的同时，革命大批判也有了广泛深入的开展。从四月份以来，单是全行业举行的批判大会，就有三十多次，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其一小撮同伙推行的修正主义路线，进行了有力的揭发和批判。通过大批判，大家不仅进一步看到了全行业共同存在的严重问题，找到了过去发生分歧和矛盾的总根子，而且进一步体会到共同对敌的重要性，从而在政治上，思想上巩固和发展了按照系统的革命大联合。
    （三）人民解放军大力支左，对按照系统实现革命的大联合作出了积极的贡献。
    在这个工业局系统执行支左任务的人民解放军驻沪海军指战员，在按照系统实现革命大联合的过程中，他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，既帮助无产阶级革命派狠抓四个第一，大兴三八作风，不断加强思想政治工作，又协助无产阶级革命派排除外部的干扰和克服内部无政府主义思潮的冲击，正确处理各种内部矛盾，坚定地沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。他们对尚未参加系统革命大联合的基层单位和革命群众组织，进行耐心地说服教育，帮助他们认清形势，掌握方向，迅速回到本单位参加革命大联合。
    执行支左任务的驻沪海军指战员，还从实际出发，经过有关领导机关的批准，采取了一项更有利于促进全行业文化大革命深入发展的重要措施，这就是：在局一级建立支左领导小组，统一领导本行业所有基层工厂的部队支左工作；在局属四个公司分别建立支左领导小组，负责指挥公司所属工厂的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队。这样，不仅能适应按照系统实现革命大联合的需要，而且更好地促进了革命大联合的巩固和发展。
    按照系统实现革命大联合显示了巨大优越性
    这个工业局系统的无产阶级革命派由于建立了整个行业统一的革命群众组织，不断巩固和发展了按照系统的革命大联合，并且在这个基础上建立了具有广泛代表性和无产阶级权威的局革命委员会，人民解放军又按照系统统一领导支左工作，三条线拧成一股绳，因而使按照系统实现的革命大联合，从各方面显示了巨大的优越性。
    首先，大大促进了革命的三结合。到目前为止，已有百分之七十左右的基层单位建立或即将建立革命委员会。
    其次，大大推动了革命大批判广泛深入开展，并且把大批判和各单位的斗批改真正结合起来。由于本行业本单位的革命群众最熟悉本行业本单位的情况，对本行业本单位受修正主义路线毒害的感受最深，因而在革命大批判和斗批改中他们最懂得本行业本单位应当斗什么、批什么、改什么，应当怎么斗、怎么批、怎么改。因此，这个工业局系统的革命大批判，一直开展得很有成效。通过大会、小会和班组批判，人人口诛笔伐，不仅从各方面肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线的流毒和影响，还把革命大批判和斗批改结合了起来，从大批判中明确改革的方向。
    第三，保证了“抓革命，促生产”方针的贯彻执行，在革命运动开展得轰轰烈烈的同时，生产工作也搞得热气腾腾。这个工业局系统今年前三个季度的生产总值，比去年同期增长百分之十。
    此外，按照系统实行革命的大联合，还能充分发动群众对干部和革命群众组织负责人进行经常的帮助和监督，把在革命大风大浪中经过锻炼和考验的优秀分子，选拔到各级领导岗位上来。同时，还能依靠本单位、本组织的群众，把混进革命群众组织的个别坏人清除出去。
