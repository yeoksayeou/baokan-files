In the midst of the unprecedentedly excellent situation of the nationwide proletarian cultural revolution, and in the high tide of the proletarian educational revolution, the revolutionary Red Guards of higher education institutions in Shanghai held a representative congress from the 17th to the 19th of this month.

This congress was a gathering for the revolutionary Red Guards of Shanghai to further implement revolutionary unity and further promote a vibrant revolutionary spirit. The congress solemnly declared: "The source of the January Revolution, Shanghai, has united its higher education revolutionary Red Guards! The revolutionary, combatant, unified organization of the higher education revolutionary Red Guards in Shanghai—the Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Red Guards Congress—has been born!"

This congress was also a mobilization and oath-taking meeting to further mobilize and organize the broad masses of revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary faculty and staff to actively participate in the proletarian educational revolution. The congress called on all revolutionary Red Guards in higher education institutions in Shanghai to take action, closely follow the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on conducting the proletarian educational revolution, take "criticize self and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, and wholeheartedly participate in the unprecedentedly great, magnificent, and heroic proletarian educational revolution. They must thoroughly smash the old bourgeois educational system and establish a new proletarian educational system; with Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the guideline, they are determined to turn Shanghai's higher education institutions into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

This congress was held under the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. During the meeting, Zhang Chunqiao, a leading member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, and other leading members of the committee attended the congress. Zhang Chunqiao made an important speech at the meeting, warmly congratulating the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Red Guards Congress.

The congress was filled with a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere of the Red Guards throughout. The 17th was the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's talk with Chinese students and trainees in Moscow. Ten years ago, Chairman Mao warmly instructed Chinese revolutionary youth: "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your lives, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you.... The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." At the representative congress, the revolutionary Red Guards repeatedly read the great teacher's great instructions, feeling the highest honor and infinite pride. They excitedly expressed their determination not to disappoint the great leader's sincere hopes, vowing to be "revolutionaries who will carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end," and to definitely turn our great motherland into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought and build the world into a new world of Mao Zedong Thought.

This congress was held on the basis of the revolutionary Red Guards in various higher education institutions in Shanghai implementing revolutionary unity according to their systems and classes. Currently, the 37 full-time universities and half-work, half-study colleges in Shanghai have basically achieved revolutionary unity, established unified revolutionary Red Guard organizations for the entire school, and a considerable number of schools have established revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination. The successful convening of this congress marks a new development and consolidation of the revolutionary unity of the higher education Red Guards in Shanghai.

The congress listed the issue of educational revolution as the most important agenda item and conducted serious discussions. During the meeting, revolutionary Red Guards representatives from various schools also held on-site meetings at Tongji University and East China Normal University, which are at the forefront of the educational revolution in higher education institutions across the city. The representatives participated in the criticism meetings held by the two schools, exposed the harm of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, denounced the crimes of the bourgeois intellectuals' control over the schools, and exchanged experiences and insights on the educational revolution.

The congress also exchanged experiences on how to reform various disciplines such as engineering, science, liberal arts, medicine, and arts, and finally passed the "Draft Appeal of the Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Red Guards Congress on Launching the Proletarian Educational Revolution."

The congress believed that the proletarian educational revolution personally initiated and led by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao is a great revolution that overturns the heavens and the earth on the educational front, an extremely profound social revolution, and a continuation and development of the struggle for power. This great revolution is related to whether the proletarian cultural revolution can achieve a thorough victory, whether our revolutionary cause has successors, and whether the future and destiny of socialism are related. It is a matter of great importance for the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end." The meeting pointed out that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the fundamental policy and fundamental line for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. The attitude towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the attitude towards the proletarian educational revolution are the touchstone and dividing line for distinguishing "revolutionaries" from "conservatives" at present, and are an important sign for judging whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The congress called on every revolutionary Red Guard fighter in higher education institutions to firmly establish the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Each Red Guard must seriously understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strive to learn Chairman Mao's educational thoughts, regard the proletarian educational revolution as their sacred duty, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolution, and strive to be an active element in the proletarian educational revolution.

The congress also called on: Each revolutionary Red Guard must fiercely fight against the "self," set great aspirations, dare to tread the path that no one has ever trodden, dare to climb the peaks that no one has ever climbed, and strive to be revolutionaries who change the heavens and the earth, and not reformers who make minor repairs. Towards the old bourgeois educational system, it must be thoroughly criticized, and a brand-new proletarian educational system must be established. In the educational revolution, revolutionary Red Guards must conduct serious investigations and research. At present, it is still necessary to pay special attention to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and always direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Shanghai, Chen Pi and Cao Qiu. It is necessary to launch a broader and deeper wave of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation, further consolidate revolutionary unity, help revolutionary cadres come forward, and quickly achieve the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

At the congress, the representatives of the revolutionary Red Guards also seriously discussed the construction of the Red Guards and read the "Draft Provisional Regulations for the Organization of the Red Guards in Higher Education Institutions in Shanghai." The congress emphasized that the Red Guards are a vibrant revolutionary youth organization that must always maintain the proletarian revolutionary nature of the Red Guards and build the Red Guards into a strong combat force that will always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the proletarian revolution.

The congress, amidst the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" and thunderous applause, passed a telegram of respect to our most, most beloved great leader, the red commander of the revolutionary Red Guards, Chairman Mao. The nearly 2,000 revolutionary Red Guards who attended the congress and the more than 20,000 revolutionary Red Guard youths in the city sincerely wished our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    号召革命红卫兵以斗私批修为纲全心全意投入空前伟大的教育革命中去
    强调要把红卫兵建成为永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的坚强的战斗队伍
    新华社上海二十六日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，在无产阶级教育革命的高潮中，上海市大专院校革命红卫兵十七日到十九日召开了代表大会。
    这个大会，是上海革命红卫兵进一步实行革命大联合，进一步发扬朝气勃勃的革命精神的大会。大会庄严宣告：“一月革命”风暴策源地上海的大专院校革命红卫兵联合起来了！上海市大专院校革命红卫兵革命的战斗的统一组织——上海市大专院校红代会诞生了！
    这个大会，也是进一步发动和组织广大革命红卫兵和革命的师生员工，积极投入无产阶级教育革命的动员大会和誓师大会。大会号召全市大专院校革命红卫兵积极行动起来，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，全心全意地投入空前伟大、空前壮丽、空前豪迈的无产阶级教育革命中去，彻底摧毁旧的资产阶级教育制度，创建新型的无产阶级教育制度；以毛主席的“五·七”指示为指针，决心把上海大专院校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    这个大会是在上海市革命委员会的领导下召开的。会议期间，上海市革命委员会负责人张春桥同志、廖政国同志以及上海市革命委员会其他领导成员，都出席了大会。张春桥同志在会上作了重要讲话，热烈祝贺上海市大专院校红卫兵代表大会的成立。
    大会始终洋溢着革命红卫兵昂扬的战斗气氛。十七日是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在莫斯科会见我国留学生和实习生时的谈话十周年。十年前，毛主席亲切教导我国革命青年：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。……世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”在代表大会上，革命的红卫兵们反复地诵读了伟大导师的这一伟大教导，感到无上光荣，无限自豪。他们激动地表示，决不辜负伟大领袖的殷切希望，誓作“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，一定要把我们伟大的祖国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把世界建成毛泽东思想的新世界。
    这个大会，是在上海各个高等学校革命红卫兵按照系统、按照班级实行革命大联合的基础上召开的。目前，上海三十七所全日制大学和半工半读专科学校，都已基本上实现了革命的大联合，建立了全校统一的革命红卫兵组织，有相当一批学校已建立了三结合的革命委员会。这个大会的胜利召开，标志着上海大专院校革命红卫兵的革命大联合有了新的发展和巩固。
    大会把教育革命问题列为最重要的议题，进行了认真的讨论。会议期间，来自各校的革命红卫兵代表，还分别到在教育革命中走在全市高等学校前列的同济大学、华东师范大学，举行了现场会议。代表们参加了这两个学校举行的批判大会，同革命的师生员工一道揭发反革命修正主义教育路线的毒害，控诉资产阶级知识分子对学校统治的罪行，并且座谈交流了教育革命的心得体会。
    大会还就工科、理科、文科、卫生、艺术等学科如何进行改革，交流了经验，最后通过了《上海市大专院校红卫兵代表大会关于掀起无产阶级教育革命的号召书（草案）》。
    大会认为，由我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级教育革命，是教育战线上的一场天翻地覆的大革命，是一场极其深刻的社会革命，是夺权斗争的继续和发展。这一场大革命，关系到无产阶级文化大革命能否取得彻底胜利，关系到我们的革命事业是否后继有人，关系到社会主义的前途和命运，是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”会议指出，毛主席的这一最新教导，是进行无产阶级教育革命的根本方针，根本路线。对待毛主席这一最新指示采取什么态度，对待无产阶级教育革命采取什么态度，是当前区分“革”与“保”，是区分无产阶级革命派还是小资产阶级革命派的试金石和分水岭，是鉴别是否忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。
    大会号召，大专院校的每一个革命红卫兵战士，都要大树特树我们伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树战无不胜的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。每个红卫兵要认真领会毛主席的最新指示，努力学习毛主席的教育思想，把无产阶级教育革命当成自己神圣的职责，继续发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，争当无产阶级教育革命的积极分子。
    大会还号召：每一个革命红卫兵要狠斗“私”字，要树雄心，立大志，敢于走前人从未走过的道路，敢于攀登先辈从未攀登的高峰，要做改天换地的革命者，决不做修修补补的改良派。对旧的资产阶级教育制度，就是要彻底批判，从而建立起崭新的无产阶级教育制度。在教育革命中，革命的红卫兵要认真地进行调查研究。当前，仍然要特别注意紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头始终对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人陈丕显—曹荻秋之流。要更广泛、更深入地掀起革命大批判和斗批改的高潮，进一步巩固革命的大联合，帮助革命的干部站出来，迅速地实现革命三结合。
    在大会上，革命红卫兵的代表们还认真地讨论了红卫兵的建设问题，并且宣读了《上海大专院校红卫兵组织条例（试行草案）》。大会强调红卫兵是朝气勃勃的革命青年组织，要永远保持红卫兵的无产阶级革命性，要把红卫兵建设成为一支在无产阶级革命中永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的坚强的战斗队伍。
    大会在“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声和暴风雨般的掌声中，通过了上海市大专院校红卫兵代表大会给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、革命红卫兵的红司令毛主席的致敬电。参加大会的近两千名革命红卫兵和全市两万多名革命红卫兵小将，衷心地祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
