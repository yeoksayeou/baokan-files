The heroic patriotic military and civilian people of Laos' Xieng Khouang Province shot down a U.S. aircraft on October 29. This is the 700th U.S. aggressor aircraft shot down by the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos since May 17, 1964.

The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary saying that the brilliant victory achieved by the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos has frustrated the U.S. imperialists' so-called "air superiority" and contributed to further shattering the U.S. imperialists' plot of "special warfare" in Laos.

The commentary called on the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos to maintain high vigilance at all times, concentrate hatred on the muzzle of the gun, and shoot down more U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The New China News Agency, Khamkeut. According to a recent broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, over the past three years, the heroic patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have shot down 700 U.S. aggressor aircraft. The 700th U.S. aircraft was shot down by the patriotic military and civilian people of Xieng Khouang Province on October 29. On November 4, the Supreme Commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Kaysone Phomvihane, sent a telegram to the patriotic military and civilian people of Xieng Khouang Province, praising them for their brilliant victory. The telegram said that the victory of shooting down the 700th U.S. aggressor aircraft is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys.

The telegram said: "The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys attempt to use their air force to threaten the spirit of our military and civilian people, which is foolish. They cannot shake the will of our military and civilian people in the slightest. The more frantically they pursue their aggression, the more severe their defeats will be."

The telegram called on the military and civilian people of Xieng Khouang Province to further heighten their vigilance, summarize their combat experience, and shoot down more U.S. aggressor aircraft.
