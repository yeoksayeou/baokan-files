The Vietnamese Government strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' recent despicable act of sending bandit planes to savagely bomb Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The statement declares that the U.S. bandits' bombing of Hanoi has further ignited the Vietnamese people's hatred and strengthened their fighting spirit. The military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam are more determined than ever to advance bravely, exploiting their initiative to strike the enemy more fiercely and accurately in their most vulnerable spots as punishment for their aggression against the capital. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Since October 24, 1967, the U.S. government has dispatched aircraft to repeatedly attack Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. U.S. planes have dropped various bombs and fired missiles at the city center and suburbs, with particular barbarity in dropping cluster bombs on densely populated residential streets. In just the past few days, more than 200 innocent civilians have been killed or injured, and over 150 buildings have been burned or destroyed.

This is an extremely serious "escalation" in the U.S.'s war of destruction against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to extricate itself from the quagmire and desperate situation in South Vietnam.

Recently, U.S. President Johnson has been loudly proclaiming that the U.S. is "ready to negotiate at any time." However, it is clear that this is merely a ploy to cover up the U.S.'s efforts to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. In South Vietnam, the U.S. has not only increased the deployment of U.S. troops, aircraft, and warships but has also coerced the Saigon puppet regime and the puppet governments of Australia, Thailand, New Zealand, and South Korea to provide more mercenaries. In North Vietnam, the U.S. has been continuously attacking Haiphong over the past two months, continuously shelling the demilitarized zone with aircraft and artillery, and now is madly attacking the capital, Hanoi.

The U.S.'s extremely dangerous "escalation" of the war and new barbaric crimes are a blatant provocation against the people and international opinion of various countries who are firmly demanding that the U.S. unconditionally stop bombing North Vietnam and withdraw all its troops from South Vietnam, including U.S. public opinion.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests to the international community the U.S. government's crime of attacking Hanoi, demanding that the U.S. must unconditionally and permanently stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war, must stop the war of aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. troops and their lackeys from South Vietnam, and allow the people of South Vietnam to resolve their internal affairs themselves. The U.S. must fully respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam as stipulated in the 1954 Geneva Agreements on the Vietnamese question.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam calls on the governments and peoples of all socialist fraternal countries, other countries' governments and peoples, and all organizations and individuals who maintain peace, freedom, and justice to strongly protest and take resolute actions to sever the claws of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

The U.S. bandits' bombing of Hanoi has further ignited the Vietnamese people's hatred and strengthened their fighting spirit. The people of Hanoi have already given the aggressors their due punishment, shooting down many planes and capturing many bandits. The military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam are more determined than ever to advance bravely, exploiting their initiative to strike the enemy more fiercely and accurately in their most vulnerable spots as punishment for their aggression against the capital, Hanoi. The extremely serious "escalation" of the war by U.S. imperialism has further exposed its failure and desperate situation in the war of aggression against Vietnam, especially in the South, and further exposed its aggressive ambitions and deceitful rhetoric, leading to even more severe defeats for it on the Vietnamese battlefield, internationally, and within the U.S. The Vietnamese people are more spirited and confident than ever, more determined to fight and achieve victory, and more dedicated and steadfast in their long, arduous but inevitable struggle for their sacred national interests and to fulfill their lofty international duties to the world's people, contributing actively to peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress.

    越南政府强烈谴责美帝轰炸河内
    南北军民决心更狠更准打击美帝
    严正揭穿美帝大肆宣扬“随时准备谈判”以掩饰扩大战争的狡猾手段
    新华社河内三十一日电　越南民主共和国政府三十日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近接连派遣强盗飞机野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的滔天罪行。
    声明表示，美国强盗轰炸河内，进一步燃起了越南人民的仇恨怒火，增强了越南人民的战斗意志。越南南北两方军民更加奋勇前进，发扬主动进攻的优势，誓在敌人最致命的地方给敌人以更狠更准的打击，作为对它侵犯首都罪行的惩罚。声明全文如下：
    从一九六七年十月二十四日以来，美国政府派遣飞机连续袭击越南民主共和国首都河内。美国飞机向市中心和郊区投下了各种炸弹并发射导弹，特别野蛮的是，美国飞机向许多居民最稠密的街道投下了珠型炸弹。只在过去几天里，就有二百多名无辜居民被炸死炸伤，一百五十多幢房屋被烧毁或炸毁。
    这是美国在对越南民主共和国发动的破坏性战争中进行极其严重的“升级”，妄图摆脱它在越南南方深陷泥足和走投无路的处境。
    最近，美国总统约翰逊又大肆宣扬美国“随时准备谈判”的论调。但是，很明显，这只不过是为了掩饰美国竭力加强和扩大侵略越南战争的一种手段而已。对越南南方，美国不仅增派美国军队、飞机和军舰，而且还胁迫西贡走狗政权和澳大利亚、泰国、新西兰、南朝鲜等仆从政府给它提供更多的雇佣军。对越南北方，美国两个月来连续袭击海防，连续用飞机和大炮袭击非军事区，现在又疯狂地袭击首都河内。
    美国的这一极其危险的战争“升级”行动和新的野蛮罪行，对正在坚决要求美国无条件地停止轰炸越南北方和把军队全部撤出越南南方的各国人民和国际舆论，其中包括美国舆论，进行了明目张胆的挑衅。
    越南民主共和国政府向国际舆论强烈控诉美国政府袭击河内的罪行，要求美国必须无条件和永远地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须停止侵略越南的战争，把美军及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，让越南南方人民自己解决自己的内部事务，必须彻底尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议所规定的越南的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    越南民主共和国政府呼吁各个社会主义兄弟国家政府和人民，呼吁其他国家政府和人民以及所有维护和平、自由和正义的组织和人士，发出强烈的抗议，采取坚决的行动，以便斩断美帝国主义侵略越南的魔爪。
    美国强盗轰炸河内，进一步燃起了越南人民的仇恨怒火，增强了越南人民的战斗意志。河内军民已经给侵略者以应有的惩罚，接连击落许多飞机和活捉许多飞贼。越南南北两方军民更加奋勇前进，发扬主动进攻的优势，誓在敌人最致命的地方给敌人以更狠更准的打击，作为对它侵犯首都河内罪行的惩罚。美帝国主义目前进行的极其严重的战争“升级”，更加暴露了它在侵略越南战争中，尤其是在南方的失败和走投无路的处境，更加揭穿了它的侵略野心和狡猾论调，从而使它在越南战场上、在国际上和在美国国内遭到更加惨重的失败。越南人民比任何时候都更加振奋和充满信心，更加坚决战斗，坚决夺取胜利，更加努力和坚持不渝地为自己的神圣民族利益，为履行对世界人民崇高的国际义务而进行长期、艰苦但必定胜利的战斗，为和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步作出积极的贡献。
                           一九六七年十月三十日于河内
