Albanian "People's Voice" recently published an editorial titled "Defending the Ideals of the October Revolution in the Struggle Against Revisionism." The editorial points out that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has betrayed the October Revolution and has become a counter-revolutionary force. All true revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists must resolutely fight against this traitorous clique.

The editorial states that the victory of the October Revolution marked the beginning of a new era of proletarian revolution and socialism, the beginning of the struggle to overthrow colonialism and national oppression, and the beginning of the collapse of world capitalism and imperialism. It demonstrated to all that the oppressed, under the leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties, can achieve liberation and build a new life through their own revolutionary struggles.

The editorial notes that the anniversary of the October Revolution is a great international holiday for the working people of the world and for those oppressed by capitalism and imperialism. As the world prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution's victory, revolutionaries and people around the world pay tribute to those who inspired, prepared, and led this revolution, and to those who defended, developed, and advanced its historic cause—Lenin and his successor Stalin. The path of October is the embodiment of the great thoughts of Lenin.

The editorial points out that today, the attitude towards the cause of the October Revolution and the thoughts of Lenin and Stalin is the touchstone that distinguishes true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries from the traitors and enemies of Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism—modern revisionists. Marxist-Leninists are now the rightful heirs of the immense wealth of revolutionary thought and experience of the October Revolution; revisionists have thrown the banner of the October Revolution into the mud, while it is the Marxist-Leninists who have raised this banner and always march at the forefront of the fierce class struggle.

The editorial emphasizes that the experience of the October Revolution and the negative experience of the Soviet Union's revisionist tragedy teach Marxist-Leninists: as long as communism has not triumphed worldwide, the victory of revolution and socialism in any country cannot be considered final; before communism triumphs worldwide, there is always the danger of capitalist restoration, not only from external imperialist armed aggression but also from internal party and socialist state revisionist degeneration into bourgeois parties and states; revisionism poses a great threat to socialism. Therefore, Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries must always be on high alert against the danger of revisionism and fight it to the end without compromise.

The editorial states that today, the world situation is revolutionary and developing in favor of revolutionary and socialist forces. Peoples of various countries are rising up to struggle and revolt. The land under the feet of the world's reactionary center and the international gendarme, U.S. imperialism, is burning, and it is being surrounded and isolated by the world's revolutionary peoples, suffering increasingly heavy blows.

The situation for Khrushchev revisionism has become even more dire, as it continues to decline and has fallen into a deep and comprehensive crisis. Its traitorous face has been exposed, and its reputation is in tatters. Resistance and struggle against revisionism are developing everywhere. In many countries around the world, even in some countries ruled by revisionism, dozens of new Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have been established.

Under these conditions, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution is a new inspiration for Marxist-Leninists and all revolutionaries to fight against imperialist and capitalist oppression and the treacherous actions of the modern revisionist enemies of revolution.

The editorial exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to use this glorious holiday to cover up their betrayal of the historic victory of the October Revolution and their conspiracy to become counter-revolutionaries and White Guard bandits. The editorial states that they are holding large-scale celebrations for the October holiday while engaging in massive deception propaganda to promote their revisionist line through fraudulent means.

However, the Soviet revisionists' despicable opportunistic actions as the October Revolution anniversary approaches expose their efforts to strip the great October of its revolutionary content, distort historical events, and especially distort Lenin's theories and experiences on revolution and proletarian dictatorship. They are trying to introduce the great revolutionary upheaval of October 1917 in Russia with opportunistic concepts and views. According to them, the revolution was merely a peaceful transfer of power from the "noble" hands of the bourgeoisie to the working class, Lenin was just a liberal democrat, the civil war was just a misunderstanding among brothers confused by the revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and it was an insignificant painful event, and so on.

The editorial points out that the Soviet revisionist clique, in the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, has turned the Soviet Union into the main venue for introducing the "achievements" of the capitalist world. This is a great desecration and mockery of the glorious history of the October Revolution, the immortal cause of Lenin and Stalin, and the blood shed by millions of Soviet people in the war against foreign interventionists and Nazi invaders.

The editorial emphasizes that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is implementing a malicious plan to deny the glorious victory of the October Revolution and the magnificent victories achieved by the Soviet people in the past. However, the Soviet revisionists' efforts to steal the name of the October Revolution and justify their betrayal will not succeed. They are not the descendants of the October Revolution but the descendants of Kautsky, Trotsky, Bukharin, and other enemies of the revolution and Lenin. They are representatives of the reactionary forces that were defeated by the October Revolution and proletarian dictatorship and are now trying to take revenge. The Khrushchev revisionist clique has finally betrayed the ideals of the October Revolution and destroyed its historic cause. It has placed itself on the side of the mortal enemies of revolution, socialism, and people's freedom, on the side of imperialists and Social Democratic traitors, Titoites, and other rabid reactionaries. The Khrushchev revisionist clique has turned itself into a counter-revolutionary force.

In discussing the experience of the October Revolution, the editorial points out that the October Revolution was victorious because it resolutely and unyieldingly advanced on the path of Marxism-Leninism, firmly and uncompromisingly fighting against the opportunist line of the Second International and its representatives in Russia. Now, when Marxism-Leninism and new opportunism (modern revisionism) are engaged in a life-and-death struggle, true revolutionaries refer to and learn from the historically significant and still beneficial lessons of the October socialist revolution. The experience of the October Revolution teaches us that violent revolution is the inevitable path for the proletariat to overthrow the bourgeoisie and achieve victory. This is a universal law of proletarian revolution, valuable and indispensable for every country that has taken the revolutionary path. Arm the proletariat, educate the proletariat, and prepare to overthrow the bourgeoisie with armed force—this is the essence of the Bolshevik strategy in the October Revolution.

The editorial states that the October Revolution was carried out based on the idea of proletarian dictatorship. Lenin often said that proletarian dictatorship is the main thing in Marxist-Leninist theory. The actual experience of the October Revolution confirms that if the bourgeois state machine is not fundamentally smashed and destroyed, and proletarian dictatorship is not established in its place, the proletariat cannot defeat the bourgeoisie, build a new socialist and communist society, or defend the victories already achieved.

The editorial continues that another historical experience of the October Revolution is: to overthrow the bourgeoisie, establish and implement proletarian dictatorship, and successfully wage class struggle and build socialism, a Marxist-Leninist leadership of the proletarian revolutionary party is needed. Only a party built on Marxist-Leninist theory, which can creatively apply Marxist-Leninist theory to the specific conditions and circumstances of its own country, a party united by the conscious iron discipline of the proletariat, a party with a set of principled strategies and tactics, and a party that applies this set of strategies and tactics in any situation of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, can ensure such leadership.

The editorial states that the experience of the October Revolution is a call for all true revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists to rebel against the betrayal of revisionism, a call for the people of the Soviet Union and other revisionist countries to overthrow the traitorous clique that has usurped the leadership of the party and the state. Let the glorious day of the Russian socialist revolution inspire the true supporters of Red October and the descendants of those who overthrew the autocracy and established the Soviet power to bravely take the path of resolute struggle to overthrow this treacherous revisionist leadership!

The editorial expresses confidence that the communist revolutionaries of the Soviet Union will honorably fulfill their lofty responsibilities to socialism, to their people and their glorious homeland, and to the world revolutionary movement. They will inherit the glorious traditions of Lenin and Stalin's party—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)—and once again raise high the red flag of the great October Revolution and defend its cause.

The editorial concludes by stating that for the Albanian Party of Labor, the red flag of the October Revolution has been, is, and will forever be its banner. Loyalty to the revolutionary cause of the Albanian people, a high sense of internationalism for the fate of socialism and communism, loyalty to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the great thoughts of the October Revolution, have inspired and will continue to inspire our party in its unyielding struggle against Khrushchev's modern revisionism. The Albanian Party of Labor will unite with the glorious Communist Party of China and all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces around the world, shoulder to shoulder, to fight against imperialism and modern revisionism and to fight for the victory of the great ideals of the October socialist revolution worldwide.

    继承十月革命传统把世界无产阶级革命推向胜利
    十月革命的经验证明了暴力革命是工人阶级推翻资产阶级获得胜利的必由之路
    苏修集团彻底背叛了十月革命，一切马列主义者必须同这个叛徒集团坚决斗争
    新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》最近发表题为《在反对修正主义的斗争中保卫十月革命的思想》的社论，指出勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团背叛十月革命，已经变成了反革命势力，一切真正的革命者和马克思列宁主义者必须同这个叛徒集团进行坚决的斗争。
    社论说，由于十月革命的胜利，开始了无产阶级革命与社会主义的新时代，开始了为推翻殖民主义制度和民族压迫而斗争的时代，全世界资本主义和帝国主义崩溃的时代，它向所有的人表明，被剥削者在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，通过他们自己的革命斗争，是能够取得解放并建设新的生活的。
    社论说，十月革命节是全世界劳动人民、受资本主义与帝国主义剥削与压迫的人们的伟大国际节日。全世界革命者和全世界人民在准备庆祝十月革命胜利五十周年的时候，以崇敬的心情怀念着鼓舞、准备和领导这一革命的人，怀念着保卫、发展和把它的具有历史意义的事业推向新的胜利的人——列宁和他的事业的继承者斯大林。十月的道路是伟大的列宁的思想的体现。
    社论指出，今天，对十月革命事业的态度，对列宁和斯大林的思想的态度，是区别真正的马克思列宁主义者和真正的革命者与马克思列宁主义、革命和社会主义的叛徒和敌人，即现代修正主义者的试金石。马克思列宁主义者现在是十月革命思想和无限丰富的革命经验的巨大财富的合法继承者；修正主义者把十月革命的旗帜扔进了泥潭，而正是马克思列宁主义者把这面旗帜举了起来，并且始终高举着这面旗帜走在激烈的阶级搏斗的前头。
    社论强调指出，十月革命的经验和苏联发生修正主义悲剧的反面经验告诉马克思列宁主义者：只要共产主义尚未在全世界取得胜利，每一个国家的革命和社会主义的胜利就不能认为是最后的胜利；在共产主义在全世界取得胜利以前始终存在着资本主义复辟的危险，这种危险不仅来自外部，来自帝国主义的武装侵略，而且也来自内部，即党和社会主义国家发生修正主义的蜕化而变成资产阶级性质的党和国家；修正主义是对社会主义的非常大的威胁。因此，马克思列宁主义者和革命者对修正主义的危险始终保持着最高的警惕，并且毫不妥协地、毫不留情地与这种危险斗争到底。
    社论说，今天，世界形势是革命的，而且正在朝着有利于革命和社会主义力量的方面发展。各国人民相继奋起进行斗争和革命。世界反动派的中心及其国际宪兵美帝国主义的脚下的土地正在燃烧，它正受到世界革命人民的包围而陷于孤立，而且正遭到他们越来越沉重的打击。
    形势对赫鲁晓夫修正主义来说变得更加严重，赫鲁晓夫修正主义正在日益衰落，而且已陷入深刻和全面的危机之中。它的叛徒面目已被揭露，而且声望狼藉。对修正主义的反抗和斗争到处都在发展。在世界许多国家，甚至在修正主义所统治的一些国家中，已经建立起几十个新的马列主义政党和组织。
    在这些条件下庆祝伟大的十月革命五十周年对马克思列宁主义者和所有的革命者来说是一个新的鼓舞，动员他们起来对帝国主义和资本主义压迫，对革命的死敌现代修正主义者的叛逆行径进行斗争和革命。
    社论揭露了苏修领导集团，企图利用这个光辉的节日来掩盖自己对十月革命的历史性胜利的背叛，掩盖自己蜕化成为反革命分子和白卫军匪徒的阴谋。社论说，他们大规模地庆祝十月节，同时大肆进行骗人宣传，企图用欺诈手段来推行其修正主义路线。
    但是苏联修正主义者现在随着十月革命周年的临近所干的卑鄙的投机行径暴露他们使伟大的十月失去革命内容，歪曲历史事件，特别是歪曲列宁关于革命和无产阶级专政的理论和经验的行动。他们正在想用机会主义的概念和观点来介绍俄国一九一七年十月的伟大的革命动荡的历史。照他们说来，革命不过是把权力从资产阶级的“高贵的”手中和平地交到工人阶级的手中，列宁不过是一个自由民主党人，内战不过是被革命和无产阶级专政弄得晕头转向的兄弟之间的误会，是不值得一提的痛苦的事等等。
    社论指出，苏修集团在十月革命五十周年庆祝活动中，把苏联变成了介绍资本主义世界“成就”的主要场所，这种丑事，是对十月革命的光辉历史，对列宁和斯大林的不朽事业，对千百万苏联人民在抗击外国干涉者和纳粹侵略者的战争中流下的鲜血的莫大的亵渎和讽刺。
    社论强调指出，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团正在实施一个否定十月革命的光荣胜利，否定伟大战争和苏联人民过去取得的辉煌胜利的恶毒计划。但是，苏修为窃取十月革命的名义和为他们的背叛行为辩解所作的努力是不会得逞的。他们不是十月革命的后代，而是考茨基、托洛茨基、布哈林的后代，是革命和列宁的其他敌人的后代。他们是被十月革命和无产阶级专政打倒了和正在试图进行报复的反动势力的代表。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团已经最后背叛了十月革命的思想，破坏了它的具有历史意义的事业。它把自己置于革命、社会主义和人民自由的不共戴天的死敌的一边，置于帝国主义者和社会民主党叛徒、铁托分子和其他疯狂的反动派的一边。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团已经使自己变成反革命势力。
    社论在谈到十月革命的经验时指出，十月革命之所以胜利，是由于它是坚决地、不屈不挠地在马克思列宁主义的道路上前进，坚定地、毫不妥协地同第二国际及其在俄国的代表的机会主义路线进行斗争。现在，当马克思列宁主义和新机会主义（现代修正主义）正在进行一场生死大搏斗的时候，真正的革命者参考并吸取了十月社会主义革命的具有历史意义的及其至今仍然有益的教训。十月革命的经验教导我们，暴力革命，是推翻资产阶级，工人阶级获得胜利的必由之路。这是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，对于走上了革命道路的每一个国家都是宝贵的和不可缺少的。武装无产阶级，教育无产阶级，准备以武装的暴力推翻资产阶级，这就是布尔什维克在十月革命中的策略的精华。
    社论说，十月革命是根据无产阶级专政的思想进行的，列宁经常说，无产阶级专政是马克思列宁主义理论的主要的东西。十月革命的实际经验证实，如果不从根本上打碎、摧毁资产阶级的国家机器，不用无产阶级专政代替它，无产阶级就不能战胜资产阶级，就不能建立新的社会主义社会和共产主义社会，就不能保卫已取得的胜利。
    社论接着说，十月革命的另一个历史经验是：要推翻资产阶级、要建立和实行无产阶级专政，要胜利地展开阶级斗争和进行社会主义建设，那就需要无产阶级革命党的马克思列宁主义领导。只有一个按照马克思列宁主义理论建立起来的党，能够把马克思列宁主义理论创造性地运用于本国的具体条件和情况之中的党，为无产阶级的自觉的铁的纪律所统一起来的党，具有一整套原则性的战略和策略、并在革命斗争和社会主义建设的任何情况中运用这套战略和策略的党，才能确保这种领导。
    社论说，十月革命的经验是要求一切真正的革命者和马克思列宁主义者起来造反，反对修正主义背叛行为的号召，它是要求苏联和其他修正主义国家的人民起来推翻篡夺了党和国家领导的叛徒集团的响亮号召。让俄国社会主义革命的光荣节日鼓舞红十月的真正拥护者和那些推翻专制制度、建立苏维埃政权的人们的子孙们勇敢地走上为推翻这个卖国的修正主义领导而进行坚决斗争的道路吧！
    社论表示坚信，苏联革命的共产党人将光荣地完成他们对社会主义、对他们的人民和他们的光荣的祖国、对世界革命运动所担负的崇高的责任，他们将继承列宁和斯大林的党——苏联共产党（布尔什维克）的光荣传统，重新高高举起伟大十月革命的红旗并维护它的事业。
    社论最后说，对于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党来说，十月革命的红旗过去是、现在是、将来也永远是它的旗帜。对阿尔巴尼亚人民革命事业的忠诚、对社会主义和共产主义命运的高度的国际主义责任感、对马克思列宁主义教导和伟大十月革命思想的忠诚，曾经鼓舞并将继续鼓舞我们党对赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义进行不懈斗争。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党将同光荣的中国共产党和全世界所有马克思列宁主义政党和力量团结一致，肩并肩地把反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争、把争取十月社会主义革命的伟大思想在全世界取得胜利的斗争进行到底。
