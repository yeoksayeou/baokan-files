The People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible in the world.

Friends from various countries praise our army as the defender of world revolution and a reliable pillar of China's Cultural Revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought has become the spiritual sustenance of the People's Liberation Army. With such a strong army, it can ensure the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We sincerely wish the People's Liberation Army to be Mao Zedong's "mountain eagle" and the defender of world revolution. We firmly believe that with such heroic soldiers, China will never change color.

The People's Liberation Army is an invincible army nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army has been the most loyal executor and defender of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, becoming the pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great School of Mao Zedong Thought

The People's Liberation Army, established according to Chairman Mao's military thoughts, is a completely new type of army that the world has never seen before. The People's Liberation Army is not only a powerful fighting force and a close-knit working team that connects with the masses, but also an outstanding propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought. He emphasized that such a people's army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible in the world.

Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, is the most loyal executor of Mao Zedong's military thoughts. The People's Liberation Army directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao is the great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

U.S. imperialism is most afraid of the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of Chinese militia armed with Mao Zedong Thought. If U.S. imperialism dares to invade China, it will surely be beaten to a pulp and drowned in the vast ocean of people's war.

A Model for the Oppressed People of the World to Learn From

The People's Liberation Army established under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong provides the most important model for building a people's army against imperialism and reactionaries. This is a model that every Marxist-Leninist in every country should learn from.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the people's army is invincible because they are united with the people. This is not only proven correct by the victories of the People's Liberation Army but also by the victories of the Vietnamese people's army.

The People's Liberation Army is not only a powerful defender of the 700 million Chinese people but also a good model for the oppressed people of the world. This great army shows the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought.

A Strong Backbone for the Revolutionary Struggles of the People of the World

The People's Liberation Army created and led by the great leader Mao Zedong has a high level of political awareness. It insists on learning and applying Chairman Mao's teachings, arming itself with complete strategies and tactics and excellent weapons. Therefore, it is a powerful supporter of the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in their struggle against imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

The People's Liberation Army is a strong pillar for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and a powerful tool for defending the Chinese people. As the great teacher Chairman Mao said, "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

    毛泽东思想武装的中国人民解放军无敌于天下
    各国朋友盛赞我军是世界革命的保卫者
    中国文化大革命的可靠支柱
    毛泽东思想已经成为中国人民解放军的精神食粮，有这样一支坚强的军队，就能够保证无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行。我们衷心祝愿中国人民解放军成为毛泽东的“山鹰”，成为世界革命的保卫者。我们深信，有这样英勇的战士，中国永远不会改变颜色。

    中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想哺育下成长的一支战无不胜的军队。在无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军最忠实地执行和捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，成为无产阶级文化大革命的支柱。

    毛泽东思想的大学校
    根据毛主席的建军思想建立起来的中国人民解放军，是一支世界上从来没有过的完全新型的军队。中国人民解放军不仅是一支具有强大战斗力的战斗队和紧密联系群众的工作队，而且是一支出色的毛泽东思想的宣传队。他强调说，这样一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队是无敌于天下的。
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席是毛泽东建军思想的最忠实的执行者。由林彪副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军是毛泽东思想的大学校。
    美帝国主义最害怕用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军和广大的中国民兵。美帝国主义胆敢侵犯中国，它就必然会被打得头破血流，会被淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海里。

    全世界被压迫人民学习的榜样
    在毛泽东同志领导下建立的中国人民解放军，为建立反对帝国主义和反动派的人民军队提供了最重要的榜样。这是每一个国家的马克思列宁主义者都应该学习的榜样。
    毛泽东同志指出，人民军队无敌于天下，因为他们和人民打成一片。这一点不仅为中国人民解放军取得的胜利，而且为越南人民军队取得的胜利所证明是正确的。
    中国人民解放军不仅是七亿中国人民的强大的保卫者，而且是全世界被压迫人民的良好的榜样。这支伟大的军队表明了毛泽东思想的伟大。
                                        锡兰　《劳工报》
    世界人民革命斗争的坚强后盾
    由伟大的领袖毛泽东亲手缔造和领导的中国人民解放军具有高度的政治觉悟，它坚持学习和运用毛主席的学说，用完备的战略战术和精良的武器武装自己。因此，它是世界各国人民、特别是亚非拉人民反对帝国主义和苏联修正主义的有力的支持者。
    中国人民解放军是捍卫无产阶级专政的强大支柱，是保卫中国人民的有力工具。正如伟大的导师毛主席所说的：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
