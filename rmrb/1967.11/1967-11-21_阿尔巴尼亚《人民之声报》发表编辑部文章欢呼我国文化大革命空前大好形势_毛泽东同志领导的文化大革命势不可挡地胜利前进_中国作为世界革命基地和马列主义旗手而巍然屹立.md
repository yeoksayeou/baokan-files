Albania's "People's Voice" published an editorial article on November 17th titled "The Great Alliance of the Proletariat is an Irresistible Mighty Torrent of the Chinese People." The article warmly celebrates the new great victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article first warmly congratulates the revolutionary masses of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other places for achieving new victories in revolutionary great alliances under the guidance of the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is developing very smoothly. Chairman Mao said: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been mobilized so extensively and deeply."

The article points out: The great alliance of the revolution is an irresistible mighty torrent in the current new stage of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The victory of this great revolution is becoming deeper and deeper every day. In the fierce class struggle, in the resolute struggle to smash the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters, a new generation of revolutionaries is being tempered in the People's Republic of China. This new generation will ensure that the torch of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought is passed down from generation to generation, forever blocking the road to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in this great socialist country, and ensuring that the great People's China will never change its red color. This revolution of world-historical significance has defeated the revisionist plots of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices, defended the fruits of socialist victory, and made China stand tall and strong as the strongest socialist bastion, a powerful revolutionary base for the peoples of all countries, and an invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism.

The establishment of the revolutionary great alliance embodies the unshakable determination of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. These victories bring boundless joy to all true friends of the Chinese people and to those who prioritize the revolutionary and socialist cause. The Albanian people are loyal friends and comrades-in-arms of the brotherly Chinese people. They sincerely congratulate the new victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and celebrate the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Enver Hoxha has said: "The Chinese revisionists have been exposed, fully revealed, and isolated. Their positions have been fundamentally smashed, and their counter-revolutionary lines have been smashed and eliminated from all sides. The revolutionary masses, following the Marxist-Leninist teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, are seizing power and firmly holding it in their own hands, implementing revolutionary great alliances."

The article states: These victories are of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to all revolutionaries in the world. These victories inspire the oppressed peoples of various countries to struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and to fight for national and social liberation. The irresistible advance of the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a great example for the communists and peoples of the countries where the revisionist clique is in power, showing them how to rise up in revolution to overthrow the revisionists who have usurped the party and the state, and how to bring their countries back to the socialist road.

The brilliant victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made all the enemies of revolution and socialism tremble with fear. The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, and the reactionaries of various countries are constantly slandering and cursing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, trying every means to belittle its victories, and hiding the true situation of China from their own people. Traitor Brezhnev, in his speech on November 3, attacked People's China and maliciously and shamelessly slandered China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, once again barefacedly exposing his counter-revolutionary face. From the old spy Tito to the various running dogs like the traitor Djilas, under the command of the Kremlin's baton, they follow Brezhnev and echo his hysterical anti-China howls. This does not indicate their strength at all. On the contrary, it proves that the enemies are terrified, proving that they are extremely afraid of the victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its great influence among the peoples of various countries. The peoples of various countries have risen up, and in the future, they will rise up even more to oppose the slavery of capitalism, colonialism, and revisionism.

The article concludes: From the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong, the enemies have seen the complete failure of their anti-China, counter-revolutionary plots, and have seen their own doom approaching.

No force can stop the victorious advance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Hundreds of millions of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres are increasingly consolidating the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries and further strengthening the proletarian dictatorship of great People's China. The People's Republic of China will forever be red and will forever be the base of socialist revolution and the invincible base of Marxism-Leninism.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》发表编辑部文章欢呼我国文化大革命空前大好形势
    毛泽东同志领导的文化大革命势不可挡地胜利前进
    中国作为世界革命基地和马列主义旗手而巍然屹立
    新华社地拉那二十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十七日发表题为《无产阶级革命大联合是中国人民的势不可挡的强大洪流》的编辑部文章，热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命新的伟大胜利。
    文章首先热烈祝贺内蒙古自治区等地的无产阶级革命派遵循伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，实现革命大联合的新胜利。
    文章说，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在十分顺利地开展。毛主席说：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”
    文章指出：革命的大联合是当前进入新阶段的中国无产阶级文化大革命中的一股强大的和势不可挡的洪流。这场大革命的胜利正一天比一天深入。在尖锐的阶级搏斗中，在坚决摧毁反革命资产阶级司令部的斗争中，革命的新的一代正在中华人民共和国得到锻炼，这新的一代将保证毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的火炬世世代代传下去，在这个伟大的社会主义国家永远杜绝产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的道路，使伟大的人民中国永远不会改变自己的鲜红颜色。这场具有世界历史意义的革命，击败了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的修正主义阴谋，捍卫了社会主义的胜利果实，使中国作为最强大的社会主义堡垒，世界各国人民强大的革命基地和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的旗手而巍然屹立并得到加强。
    革命大联合的建立体现了亿万革命派把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的不可动摇的决心。这些胜利使中国人民的所有的真正朋友和以革命和社会主义事业为重的人们感到无限高兴。阿尔巴尼亚人民是兄弟中国人民的忠实朋友和战友，他们衷心祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的新胜利，欢呼毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。霍查同志说过：“中国的修正主义分子已经被揪出来，被充分揭露和孤立。他们的阵地已经从根本上被粉碎，他们的反革命阵线已经从四面八方被打垮和消灭。无产阶级革命派，按照毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的教导，正在把权力夺过来，可靠地掌握在自己手中，实行革命大联合。”
    文章说：这些胜利不仅对中国人民有着伟大的意义，而且对世界上一切革命者也有着伟大的意义。这些胜利鼓舞着各国被压迫人民反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，争取民族和社会解放的斗争。中国无产阶级文化大革命及其势不可挡的胜利前进，已成为修正主义集团当权国家的共产党人和人民的伟大榜样，向他们指出如何起来革命去推翻篡党篡国的修正主义者，如何使自己的国家重新回到社会主义的道路上来。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，使革命和社会主义的所有敌人怕得要死。以美国为首的帝国主义者，以勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派的大合唱，在不断诽谤和咒骂中国无产阶级文化大革命，千方百计地贬低它的胜利，对本国人民隐瞒中国的真实情况和现状。叛徒勃列日涅夫在十一月三日的讲话中攻击人民中国，最恶毒地和无耻地诽谤中国无产阶级文化大革命，再一次赤裸裸地暴露了他的反革命嘴脸。从美帝的老牌特务铁托起到叛徒丹吉之流的形形色色的走狗，在克里姆林宫的指挥棒指挥下，追随勃列日涅夫，附和他的歇斯底里的反华叫嚣。这丝毫也不表示他们有力量。相反，这证明敌人惊恐万状，证明他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利及其在各国人民中的巨大影响怕得要命。各国人民已经起来，今后将更多地起来反对资本主义、殖民主义和修正主义的奴役。
    文章最后说：从伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利中，敌人看到了自己的反华、反革命阴谋的彻底破产，看到了自己末日的来临。
    没有任何力量能够阻挡中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进。亿万中国工农兵群众，革命学生和革命干部正在日益巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，正在进一步加强伟大人民中国的无产阶级专政。中华人民共和国将永远是红色的，将永远是社会主义革命和战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的基地。
