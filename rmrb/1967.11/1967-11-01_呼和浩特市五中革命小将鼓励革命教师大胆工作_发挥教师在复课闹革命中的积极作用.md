The revolutionary young guards of the Fifth Middle School in Hohhot, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have been studying Chairman Mao's great instructions on fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism together with revolutionary teachers. They have been working together on the struggle, criticism, and transformation, and have played an active role in the teachers' work during the period of resuming classes and making revolution.

Currently, more than forty teachers in this school have returned to their teaching posts. Three teachers have been elected to the school's revolutionary leading group of the three-in-one combination. They are both teachers and students, studying Chairman Mao's works with the students, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, discussing teaching reforms, and preparing lessons together.

This school resumed classes and made revolution in July. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary young guards and revolutionary teachers denounced and criticized the reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number" in personnel issues pushed by China's Khrushchev. They studied Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, which helped many revolutionary young guards correct their attitudes towards teachers. They warmly welcomed the teachers back to the classrooms to resume classes and make revolution, which greatly promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the school.

At the beginning of resuming classes and making revolution, some teachers were not daring to take responsibility for their work. The revolutionary young guards then took the initiative to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the teachers, have heart-to-heart talks, and hold study sessions and self-criticism sessions on Chairman Mao's works. Many teachers seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings and were inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the young guards who dared to fight selfishness. They voluntarily examined and criticized their selfish thoughts, strengthened their sense of revolutionary responsibility. Some teachers said: The young guards' profound criticism of the revisionist educational line has been very helpful to us. Some teachers said: We are educators and also those who are educated. We must completely break with the bourgeois worldview and all old educational thoughts, and humbly learn from the revolutionary young guards, so that we can carry out the great educational revolution together with the revolutionary young guards.

The revolutionary young guards of this school pay great attention to giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the revolutionary teachers, warmly support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary teachers, and help them improve their work style. Many teachers, after more than a year of tempering through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly improved their ideological awareness. Some teachers, on the one hand, humbly learn from the revolutionary young guards, on the other hand, can grasp the students' ideological work with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, help and educate the revolutionary young guards to enhance their revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline. The broad revolutionary young guards firmly support the revolutionary actions of the teachers. Recently, many teachers, on the one hand, have been criticizing the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev together with the students, on the other hand, have put forward many constructive opinions on how to reform the teaching content. The revolutionary young guards actively help the teachers to supplement, modify, and enrich these opinions, and encourage the teachers to boldly go to the students to practice together, teach while reforming. What they have done has greatly promoted the teaching reform of this school.

    呼和浩特市五中革命小将鼓励革命教师大胆工作
    发挥教师在复课闹革命中的积极作用
    师生共同学习毛主席著作，共同讨论教学改革
    据新华社呼和浩特三十一日电　呼和浩特市第五中学的红卫兵革命小将，在解放军同志的帮助下，同革命教师一起认真学习毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，一起搞斗批改，发挥了教师在复课闹革命中的积极作用。
    现在，这个学校的四十多名教师已经回到教学班工作，有三名教师还被选进了学校革命三结合的领导班子。他们既当教师，又当学生，同学生一起学习毛主席著作，斗私批修，一起讨论教学改革，共同备课。
    这个学校七月份就已经复课闹革命。在解放军同志的帮助下，革命小将和革命教师控诉和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上所推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，学习了毛主席的干部政策，使得许多革命小将端正了对教师的态度。他们热情地欢迎教师回到班级复课闹革命，有力地促进了学校的革命大联合和革命的三结合。
    开始回班级复课闹革命的时候，有些教师工作不敢负责。革命小将们就主动和教师一起活学活用毛主席著作，一块谈心，一道开学习毛主席著作的讲用会和斗私批修会。不少教师认真学习了毛主席的教导，又为革命小将勇于斗私的革命精神所鼓舞，纷纷自觉地检查和批判自己的私心杂念，加强了革命责任感。有的教师说：革命小将对修正主义教育路线的深刻批判，给了我们很大的帮助。有的教师说：我们是教育者，同时也是受教育者。我们只有同资产阶级世界观和一切旧的教育思想彻底决裂，虚心向革命小将学习，才能同革命小将们一起，把伟大的教育革命进行到底。
    这个学校的革命小将，很注意发挥革命教师的主动性和积极性，热情支持革命教师的革命行动，并且帮助他们在工作中改进作风。许多教师经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，思想觉悟有了很大的提高。有些教师一方面虚心地向革命小将学习，同时又能够以毛泽东思想为指针大抓学生的政治思想工作，帮助和教育革命小将增强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。广大革命小将对于教师的这些革命行动，都表示坚决支持。最近，许多教师一方面同学生一起批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，一方面对如何改革教学内容提出了许多建设性的意见。革命小将们就积极地帮助教师补充、修改和充实这些意见，同时鼓励教师大胆地到学生中去共同实践，边教学，边改革。他们这样做的结果，对这个学校的教学改革起了很大的促进作用。
