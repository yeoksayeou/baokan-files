Albanian Newspaper Strongly Condemns the Soviet Revisionist Group's Heinous Crime of Betraying the October Revolution

The Thought of the Great October Socialist Revolution Remains Evergreen

China's Cultural Revolution and the Albanian Party of Labour's Revolutionary Measures Are New Contributions to Marxism-Leninism and a Powerful Weapon to Prevent the Emergence of Revisionism

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 7th: The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published an editorial on the 7th to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist group's betrayal of the October Revolution. The editorial pointed out that Marxist-Leninists around the world are holding high the banner of the October Revolution and pushing the revolution forward.

	In the editorial titled "The Thought of the Great October Socialist Revolution Remains Evergreen and Will Always Triumph," the "Voice of the People" said: The Great October Socialist Revolution showed that the imperialist system and world capitalism have been dealt a severe blow and have since been declining. The October Revolution showed that without fighting against various forms of opportunism, without defending and thoroughly implementing Marxism-Leninism, the socialist revolution cannot be realized, cannot be victorious, and cannot build socialism. The October Revolution showed that under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party of the proletariat, the October Revolution can be launched and carried out, the method being that the proletariat forms an alliance with the laboring peasants to launch an armed uprising, smash the bourgeois state machine, create a new state of the proletariat, and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The editorial pointed out: Today, the homeland of the Great October Revolution is experiencing its most serious period. The traitorous clique of Brezhnev-Kosygin has seized power, replacing the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the new bourgeoisie of the Soviet Union. They have joined forces with the imperialists led by American imperialism and all the traitors of communism in the world. The editorial pointed out: The party of the Soviet Union has become a bourgeois party, the dictatorship of the proletariat has become the dictatorship of the traitorous clique maintained by bayonets. The new bourgeoisie of the Soviet Union has formed, and the polarization between the exploiters and the exploited, the rich and the poor, is rapidly developing. Culture has become a variant of Western culture.

	The editorial said: In recent days, the traitors and swindlers in the style of Khrushchev have created a spectacle of "celebration activities" on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. However, whether it is a red paint job or sensational propaganda, it cannot cover up the betrayal and various crimes of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique in front of the Soviet people of all nationalities and all mankind.

	The editorial said: The echoes of the great October storm are still resonating in the hearts of the people and revolutionaries of the world, the storm of October has blown the flames and infinite power even more fiercely and vigorously, calling on people to persevere on the road of revolution, on the road of revolutionary struggle for national liberation, on the road of proletarian revolution, on the road of world revolution. The glorious Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong, our Party of Labour and its Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, all the true Marxist-Leninist parties, and the international proletariat that is resolutely fighting for the cause of socialism, freedom, and peace, have now tightly grasped the banner of the October Revolution that was discarded by the revisionists, raised it high, and pushed it forward.

	The editorial said: Our Communist Party and all the people are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labour at the same time. They are celebrating these two historic festivals closely linked together with the pride due to the Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, which has led our Communist Party and all the people from victory to victory. Our life and the historic achievements we have made confirm the ever-vibrant life of the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and confirm our eternal loyalty to Marxism-Leninism. Our Party, which has always firmly adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, has contemptuously rejected the invitation from the Moscow traitors to participate in the farce of the "celebration" of the 50th anniversary of the Russian October Revolution. As in the past, our Party will also resolutely fight against their betrayal, tear off all the masks of their deception, and expose and smash all the conspiracies and tricks they have plotted with imperialism and their revisionist lackeys in other countries, past, present, and future.

	The editorial concluded: Our Party firmly believes that the Soviet comrades, the Bolsheviks of Lenin-Stalin, will not tolerate the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists for long and will, as in the days of the Great October, rise up again to make a revolution, smash and bury this most vicious enemy, and thus save the Soviet homeland and live up to the expectations of revolutionaries all over the world.

	The newspaper "Unity" in the editorial titled "The Thought of the Great October Socialist Revolution Is Immortal" said: The Albanian Party of Labour, the glorious Communist Party of China, and other Marxist-Leninist parties, as well as all true revolutionaries, are the true successors of the Great October Socialist Revolution. They not only hold high the banner of the October Revolution but are also advancing the thought of the October Socialist Revolution. The Albanian Party of Labour and the glorious Communist Party of China have drawn lessons from the bitter experiences of the Soviet Union and further enriched Marxism-Leninism in the struggle against Khrushchev revisionism. The revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha in our country's national life, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and directly led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong in China, are new contributions to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism, a powerful weapon in the hands of communists to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and a reliable pillar for achieving the complete victory of socialism and communism in the world.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸强烈谴责苏修集团背叛十月革命的滔天罪行
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的思想永葆青春
    中国文化大革命和阿劳动党的革命化措施是对马列主义的新贡献是杜绝产生修正主义的强大武器
    据新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》七日发表社论，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年，强烈谴责苏修集团背叛十月革命的罪行，指出全世界的马克思列宁主义者正在高举十月革命的旗帜，把革命推向前进。
    《人民之声报》在题为《伟大的十月社会主义革命的思想永葆青春，永远胜利》的社论中说：伟大的十月社会主义革命表明，帝国主义体系和世界资本主义受到了极其沉重的打击，从此一蹶不振。十月革命表明，不同形形色色的机会主义作斗争，不捍卫和彻底贯彻执行马克思列宁主义，社会主义革命就不能实现、不能胜利，就不能建设社会主义。十月革命表明，在无产阶级的马克思列宁主义党的领导下，十月革命才能发动起来和进行到底，其办法就是无产阶级同劳动农民结成联盟发动武装起义，打碎资产阶级国家机器，创造无产阶级的新国家，建立无产阶级专政。
    社论指出：今天，伟大十月革命的祖国经历着最严重的时期。勃列日涅夫—柯西金这一伙叛徒集团，篡夺了政权，用苏联新资产阶级专政代替了无产阶级专政。他们同以美帝为首的世界帝国主义，同世界上所有的共产主义叛徒结成一伙。社论指出：苏联的党变成了资产阶级政党，无产阶级专政变成了靠刺刀来维持的叛徒集团的专政。苏联新的资产阶级已经形成，剥削者和被剥削者，富人和穷人之间的两极分化正在迅速发展，文化已经变成西方文化的变种。
    社论说：最近这些天，赫鲁晓夫式叛徒和骗子们，在伟大十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候，制造了“庆祝活动”的排场。但是，无论是涂一层红色的油彩，还是耸人听闻的大肆宣传，都不能在苏联各族人民和全人类面前掩盖勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团的叛卖和种种罪行。
    社论说：在世界各国人民和革命者的心中，伟大十月风暴的回声经久不息，一直在回荡着，十月革命的风暴把火焰和无穷的力量吹得越加炽烈和旺盛，号召人们在革命的道路上，在争取民族解放的革命道路上，在无产阶级革命的道路上，在世界革命的道路上，坚持到底。毛泽东的光荣的中国共产党，我们的劳动党及其以霍查同志为首的中央委员会，所有真正的马克思列宁主义党以及坚决地为社会主义、自由与和平事业而斗争的国际无产阶级，现在已经把被修正主义者丢弃的十月革命的旗帜紧紧握在手中，把它高高举起，推向前进。
    社论说：我国共产党人和全体人民，在同一个时候庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命五十周年和劳动党成立二十六周年，他们以对霍查同志为首的劳动党——党领导我国共产党人和全体人民从胜利走向胜利——应有的自豪感，欢庆紧密相联的这两个历史性的节日。我们的生活和我们所取得的历史性胜利成果证实了马克思列宁主义的不朽学说的生气勃勃的生命力，证实了我们对马克思列宁主义永世不变的忠诚。始终坚定不移地遵循马克思列宁主义原则的我们的党，蔑视地拒绝了莫斯科的叛徒们向我们党发出的参加俄国十月革命五十周年“庆典”丑剧的邀请。象到目前为止一样，我们党也将同他们的背叛进行坚决的斗争，将撕碎他们的全部骗局的假面具，将揭露和粉碎他们过去、现在和将来伙同帝国主义，伙同他们在其他国家的修正主义仆从所策划的一切阴谋诡计。
    社论最后说：我们党坚信，苏联兄弟们，列宁—斯大林的布尔什维克们，决不会长期容忍赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的叛卖，而将象在伟大十月的日子里那样，再次挺起身来闹革命，粉碎和埋葬这伙最凶恶的敌人，从而拯救苏维埃祖国，不辜负全世界革命者所寄托的希望。
    《团结报》在题为《伟大的十月社会主义革命的思想是不朽的》的社论中说：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、光荣的中国共产党和其他马克思列宁主义政党以及一切真正的革命者是伟大的十月社会主义革命的真正的继承者。他们不仅高举十月革命的旗帜，而且正在推进十月社会主义革命的思想。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和光荣的中国共产党吸取了苏联的惨痛教训并在同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的斗争中进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义。以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在我国国家生活中采取的革命措施，杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和直接领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是对马克思列宁主义宝库的新的贡献，是共产党人手中为杜绝产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的强大武器，也是争取社会主义和共产主义在全世界取得完全胜利的可靠支柱。
