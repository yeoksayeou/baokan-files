The editorial board notes: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call for the resumption of classes and the revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education has been enthusiastically responded to by the revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary students and teachers nationwide. Today, we publish some ideas from several schools, including Tongji University, on educational revolution, in the hope of sparking discussion among comrades and promoting the development of the educational revolution. These plans still need to be tested and verified through revolutionary practice.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To carry out a proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, those who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end." We hope that revolutionary cadres and masses nationwide will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and strive for great victories in the proletarian educational revolution.

Tongji University's Preliminary Ideas for Educational Reform

Based on Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," Shanghai's Tongji University sent over a hundred people to factories and construction sites in August and September to investigate and research educational reforms, and made bold plans for the school's structure.

The plan proposes transforming Tongji University into a "May 7th Commune." The commune would be an integrated entity comprising the school, design units, and construction units for teaching, design, and construction. This would change the current phenomenon of education being detached from production.

The "May 7th Commune" would abolish departments and research sections, establishing several professional committees instead. These committees would be composed of personnel from the school, production units, and design units. Under the professional committees, there would be teaching classes, each consisting of teachers, students, workers, and engineering technicians, and organized into military units.

The "May 7th Commune" would implement two "three-in-one" combinations: one being the combination of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary mass organization leaders, and militiamen, and the other being the combination of teaching, design, and construction.

Some teaching staff of the "May 7th Commune" would be rotated periodically to receive training and reform through production practice.

Political work departments would be established at all levels in the "May 7th Commune." Each professional committee would have a political instructor, and each class would have a political cadre.

The school term would be shortened to three years. Apart from courses on Mao Zedong Thought and military training, professional courses would gradually increase in theoretical content year by year. Each academic year would include participation in production practice. In the first year, half the time would be spent on construction engineering. In the second year, two-thirds of the time would be spent on design practice under the guidance of relevant technical personnel or teachers, learning the basics of design. In the third year, the focus would be on deepening the study of professional courses, continuing to participate in production labor with some of the time.

Revolutionary teachers and students at Tongji University have had heated discussions about this plan, believing that the "May 7th Commune" is a specific plan for implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" in engineering schools, with the following advantages:

1. The leadership of the school is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction, changing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the school.
2. It implements Chairman Mao's policy of combining education with productive labor, enriching teaching content and promoting production struggles and scientific experiments.
3. The teaching content is combined with specific engineering projects, greatly simplifying teaching content and changing the past phenomenon of repetitive, cumbersome, and complex course settings.
4. It is beneficial for the ideological reform of intellectuals and for eliminating the three major differences.

The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee attaches great importance to this plan, sending personnel to participate in the research and preparing to select 150 teachers, students, and staff from Tongji University, along with the East China Industrial Design Institute, to go to the 205th site on Fuxing Island for experimentation.

Beijing Forestry College Abolishes Research Sections and Establishes Professional Brigades to Lead Teaching and Reform

On October 23, Beijing Forestry College officially resumed classes. After resuming classes, they boldly made plans and reforms, abolishing the original department research sections and establishing "three-in-one" professional brigades by specialty. They combined teachers of basic professional courses and specialty courses. They changed the previous practice of researching teaching by grade to researching teaching by specialty. They have now merged the original 17 research sections of the Forestry Department into four professional brigades: Forestry, Forest Protection, Forestry Economics, and Water and Soil Conservation. They merged the original seven research sections of the Forest Industry Department into three professional brigades: Forestry Machinery, Wood Processing Machinery, and Forestry Chemistry. To strengthen the collective leadership of the brigades, each professional brigade has established a leadership group consisting of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary youngsters. This leadership group leads both the struggle, criticism, and transformation and teaching. It focuses on both politics and business. The current organizational form of the professional brigades has shown the following four advantages:

1. It breaks through the organizational structure that implements the old educational system.
2. It eliminates the previous tendency of various research sections being controlled by bourgeois professors and authorities, teachers being detached from the masses, and not focusing on political and ideological work.
3. Researching teaching by specialty is convenient for both reforming teaching and teaching itself. After resuming classes, each professional brigade will combine basic professional courses and specialty courses, combine specialty and practice, and become a one-stop teaching method. It can overcome the previous phenomenon of various research sections not communicating with each other, not coordinating with each other, and theory being detached from practice.
4. Merging research sections and organizing teaching by professional brigades can greatly save teaching resources.

Beijing Normal University's Teaching Reform Group's Ideas on Reforming Examinations, Promotion, Retention, and Admissions

1. Examinations

Chairman Mao once pointed out: "The current examination method is a method of dealing with the enemy, a sudden attack, asking eccentric and strange questions, and a method of examining eight-legged essays." The current examination method must be abolished. The new examination method must emphasize politics, link with reality, and focus on the ability to analyze and solve practical problems. It should encourage students to have independent views. Examinations should be for promoting learning, not for memorization, but for debate. It should oppose mechanical recitation of textbooks and encourage active learning and expression of personal views. However, examinations should not be too frequent, and there should be no sudden attacks. Some subjects can be exempted from examinations. The examination methods can include selective examinations, open-book examinations, and on-site examinations, allowing students to think thoroughly, discuss with each other, and refer to books.

2. Promotion and Retention

Abolish the retention system. Schools should first emphasize politics, fully mobilize students' subjective initiative in learning, and strengthen teachers' sense of responsibility in teaching.

3. Admissions

Admissions should implement the class line, with schools first opening their doors to workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Abolish the old admissions examination system. Adopt a combination of recommendations and selections, recruiting red and expert youth from graduating students and workers, peasants, and soldiers into higher-level schools.

Youth who have studied in various levels and types of part-time schools can also enter middle or higher schools for study based on their different levels.

Allow transfers. Transfers should not be restricted by age.

    关于教育革命的几个初步方案
    编者按：毛主席、党中央关于大、中、小学都要复课闹革命的号召，获得了全国广大革命群众、革命红卫兵、革命师生的热烈响应。今天，本报发表同济大学等几个学校关于教育革命的一些设想，以期引起同志们的讨论，推动教育革命的发展。这些方案，都还需要经过革命实践的检验。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”希望全国广大革命干部和革命群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的指示，为夺取无产阶级教育革命的伟大胜利而奋斗。
    同济大学教育改革的初步设想
    上海同济大学根据毛主席“五·七”指示精神，在今年八、九月间派出一百多人的调查队，到工厂、工地进行教学改革的调查研究，对学校的体制作了大胆的设想。
    设想拟把同济大学改为“五·七”公社。公社是一个由学校、施工单位、设计单位组成的教学、设计和施工三结合的统一体。这样将改变现在教育与生产脱节的现象。
      “五·七”公社废除系和教研室，设置若干专业委员会，委员会由学校、生产单位和设计单位的人员共同组成。专业委员会下设若干教学班，教学班里有教师、学生、工人、工程技术人员，并进行军事编组。
    “五·七”公社实行两个“三结合”：一是革命领导干部、革命群众组织负责人和民兵的三结合，二是教学、设计和施工的三结合。
      “五·七”公社的部分教学人员将实行定期轮换，使干部在生产实践中得到锻炼和改造。
    “五·七”公社各级建立政治工作部门，各专业委员会设政治指导员，各班配备政治干事。
    学制缩短为三年。课程除毛泽东思想课和军事课外，专业课分年度逐年增加理论课比例。每个学年都要参加生产实践。第一年以二分之一时间参加建筑工程施工。第二年以三分之二的时间，在有关技术人员或教员的指导下，通过参加设计实践，学习设计的基本知识。第三年突出重点，加深专业课程学习，继续以部分时间参加生产劳动。
    同济大学革命师生对这个方案进行了热烈讨论，认为“五·七”公社是在工科学校里执行毛主席“五·七”指示的具体方案，有如下优越性：
    一、学校的领导权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，改变了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。
    二、贯彻了毛主席的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。既丰富了教学内容，又反过来推动了生产斗争和科学试验的发展。
    三、教学内容是结合具体工程进行的，可以大大精简教学内容，改变过去课程设置重复、烦琐、庞杂的现象。
    四、有利于知识分子的思想改造，有利于消灭三大差别。
    上海市革命委员会，对这个设想极为重视，派人一道参加研究，并准备抽调同济大学一百五十名师生员工和华东工业设计院一起去复兴岛二○五号工地进行试验。
        北京林学院取消教研室组织专业连队领导教学和教改
    北京林学院，于十月二十三日正式开学。复课后，他们敢字当头，做了大胆的设想和改革，将原来的各系教研室取消，按专业组成三结合的专业连队，将教专业基础课的教师和专业教师合在一起。把以前按年级研究教学改为按专业研究教学。现在他们已把原林业系的十七个教研室，按专业合并成林业、森林保护、林业经济、水土保持四个专业连队。把森工系的原七个教研室合并为林业机械、木材机械加工、林产化学三个专业连队。为了加强连队的集体领导，每个专业连队都成立了包括革命干部、革命教师和革命小将三结合的领导小组。这个领导小组既领导斗批改，又领导教学。既抓政治，也抓业务。这个专业连队的组织形式，目前已看出有如下四点好处：
    一、冲破了推行旧教育制度的组织机构。
    二、摆脱了以前各教研室由资产阶级教授、权威控制教学和教师脱离群众、不抓政治思想工作的倾向。
    三、按专业研究教学，便于教改也便于教学。复课后各专业连队要和专业基础课和专业课相结合，专业和实际相结合，成为一条龙的教学方法。可以克服以前各教研室互不通气，互不对口，理论脱离实际的现象。
    四、教研室合并按专业连队组织教学可以大大地节约师资。
    北京师范大学教改组对改革考试、升留级和招生的设想
    一、考试
    毛主席曾经指出：“现在的考试方法是对付敌人的办法，是突然袭击，出偏题怪题，尽是考八股文的办法。”现行的考试方法，必须废除。新的考试方法，必须突出政治，联系实际，着重于分析和解决实际问题的能力，要鼓励学生有独立见解。考试是为了促进学习，不要搞成回忆性的，要搞成辩论性的，反对机械复述教材，鼓励活学活用，各抒己见。但是考试不宜过多，不搞突然袭击，有的科目可以不考。考试的方式，可以采取选题考试、开卷考试、现场考试，要让学生充分思考，允许相互讨论，参考书籍。
    二、升留级
    废除留级制。学校首先要突出政治，充分发挥学生学习的主观能动性，加强教师教学的责任感。
    三、升学
    招生要贯彻阶级路线，学校首先向工农兵开门。
    废除旧的升学考试制度。采取推荐和选拔相结合的方法，从应届毕业生中，从工农兵中，招收又红又专的青少年进入高一级学校。
    经过各级各类业余学校学习的青少年，根据不同程度，也可进入中等或高等学校学习。
    要允许插班。插班不应受年龄限制。
