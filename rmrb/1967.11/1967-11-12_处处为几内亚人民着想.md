Chinese experts assisting in the construction of the "October 2nd Hall" in Guinea are determined to teach their technical skills to Guinean workers without reservation, aiming to cultivate a group of skilled workers during the construction process. In addition to organizing technical training classes, Chinese experts also adopt the master-apprentice method to pass on their skills. Despite the language barrier, Chinese experts diligently learn French while using diagrams and demonstrations to teach Guinean workers until they can operate independently.

Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, Chinese experts often use the time before and after work, as well as during breaks, to collect and reuse short scraps, steel bar ends, and old nails on the construction site after processing them.

During high-risk operations, such as high-altitude work, Chinese experts always take the lead. When Guinean workers join them in high-altitude operations, Chinese experts ensure that the Guinean workers wear their safety belts and repeatedly check them.

In the early hours of April 1966, the weather suddenly changed, with thunder roaring and dark clouds gathering, and a cold wind carrying moisture. Chinese experts, who had been working hard all day and were sound asleep, were awakened by the thunder. They immediately thought of the cement and other materials on the construction site that were not covered. About twenty to thirty Chinese experts quickly rushed from their dormitories to the construction site, which was five to six kilometers away, and covered the construction materials just in time before the heavy rain came down.

An old worker named Abdoulaye said, "In my long life, I have worked with the French, Americans, Soviets, and Germans, but I have never seen experts as good as the Chinese experts. They always think of the interests of the Guinean people."

    处处为几内亚人民着想
    援助几内亚建设“十月二日大会堂”的中国专家，决心把技术毫无保留地教给几内亚工人，在大会堂建设过程中为几内亚培养一批技术工人。除了组织技术训练班以外，中国专家还用师傅带徒弟的办法传授技术。师徒之间语言不通，中国专家一面刻苦学习法文，一面利用画图和示范的办法教几内亚工人学技术，直至几内亚工人能单独操作为止。
    中国专家遵循毛主席的教导，经常利用上工前后及工间休息时间，在工地上收拣短残料、钢筋头、旧元钉，经过加工再利用起来。
    在工作中，遇到危险的高空作业时，中国专家总是抢先上去操作。当有几内亚工人同他们一起进行高空作业时，中国专家总要替几内亚工人带好安全带，还一再检查。
    一九六六年四月的一个深夜，天气突然变化，倾刻雷声隆隆，乌云密布，凉风中夹带着湿气。劳累了一天正在酣睡的中国专家被雷声惊醒，他们立即想到工地上的水泥和许多其它东西都没有覆盖。二、三十名中国专家立刻从宿舍赶到五、六公里以外的工地，抢在倾盆大雨下来以前及时盖好了建设物资。
    一位叫阿布杜拉耶的老工人说：“我活了这么大年纪，跟法国人、美国人、苏联人、德国人都做过工，但从来也没有见过象中国专家这样好的专家。他们处处为几内亚人民的利益着想。”
