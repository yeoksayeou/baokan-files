The "American way of life" has long been infamous. Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, has been loudly touting the so-called "Soviet way of life." One might say that this is a case of birds of a feather flocking together.

What exactly is this "Soviet way of life"? The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, *Pravda*, sums it up in one sentence: "The revolution has brought the people a great deal of welfare." In the end, it is still the old line of Khrushchev's "potatoes and beef stew."

However, this boasting of "welfareism" is just as deceitful as the so-called "welfare state" of the United States.

The Soviet revisionist clique, after carrying out a capitalist counterrevolutionary restoration in the Soviet Union, uses its control over the means of production to seek private interests for the bourgeois privileged stratum, throwing the broad masses of the Soviet people back into the abyss of oppression and exploitation. Today, the situation in the Soviet Union is one of stark wealth disparity and accelerating class differentiation. The broad masses of the Soviet people suffer hardships, while a small handful of the privileged stratum enjoy pleasures and comforts. Where is there any "welfare for all"?

There is, of course, some "social welfare," such as "bonuses" and the "five-day workweek," etc. These are the fig leaves used by the Soviet revisionist clique to cover up their system of exploitation, and the opium used to numb and corrupt the broad masses of the people. Those who truly benefit from such "social welfare" are still that small handful of the privileged stratum.

When it comes to the "way of life," there are two entirely different worlds. The laboring people have low incomes, struggle to make ends meet, and face the threat of being laid off. As for those new aristocrats and nouveaux riches, they are bloated with wealth, indulge in pleasures, and live lives of extreme luxury. Even the bourgeois press in the United States acknowledges that "Russia's new bourgeoisie is getting fatter and fatter," and that "possessing and enjoying possessions" is their purpose in life. Just look at the strange fashions, bizarre hairstyles, jazz music, twist dances, pornographic films, nude paintings, bars, and nightclubs that are all the rage in New York, Paris, and London. In today's Soviet Union, all of these are equally in vogue. And all of these are what the Soviet revisionist clique takes pride in.

What is the difference between this "Soviet way of life" and the so-called "American way of life"? Whether it is the "American way of life" or the "Soviet way of life," they are both decadent and declining ways of life of the bourgeoisie. The two are merely different brands of the same goods.

When *Pravda* boasts about the so-called "Soviet way of life," it hypocritically condemns the Western way of life as "capitalist boils." In fact, what is your so-called "Soviet way of life" if not a capitalist abscess?

    两种商标一路货色
    “美国生活方式”早已臭名昭著了。最近，苏修集团在十月革命五十周年的时候，又大肆宣扬起所谓“苏联生活方式”来。真可以说得上是无独有偶。
    所谓“苏联生活方式”究竟是什么玩艺儿呢？苏修集团的喉舌《真理报》把它概括为一句话，就是：“革命为全民谋得的大量福利”。说来说去，原来还是赫鲁晓夫的“土豆烧牛肉”那一套。
    但是，这种“福利主义”的标榜，和美国的所谓“福利国家”一样，完全是骗人的。
    苏修集团在苏联实行了资本主义反革命复辟，就利用他们支配生产资料的权力来谋取资产阶级特权阶层的私利，把广大苏联人民重新投进了被压迫、被剥削的深渊。今天苏联的情况是：贫富悬殊，阶级分化加速进行。广大苏联人民受苦受难，一小撮特权阶层享乐享福。哪里有什么“全民的福利”？
    “社会福利”，当然也并非没有，什么“奖金”啦，“五日工作制”啦等等，那是苏修集团用来掩盖他们剥削制度的遮羞布，麻醉和腐蚀广大人民的鸦片烟。而真正从这样一些“社会福利”中得到好处的，还是那一小撮特权阶层。
    说到“生活方式”，那是存在着两个迥然不同的世界。劳动人民收入低微，难得温饱，还遭受被解雇的威胁。至于那些新权贵、暴发户，则脑满肠肥，寻欢作乐，过着穷奢极欲的生活。连美国的资产阶级报刊也认为“俄国的新资产阶级越来越肥了”，“拥有财物和享受财物”就是他们生活的目的。君不见，在纽约、巴黎、伦敦风行的什么奇装异服、怪发型，什么爵士音乐、扭摆舞，什么黄色电影、裸体画，什么酒巴舞厅、夜总会，在今天的苏联，都无不大行其道。而所有这些，正是苏修集团引为自豪的。
    这样的“苏联生活方式”，同所谓“美国生活方式”又有什么两样呢？“美国生活方式”也好，“苏联生活方式”也好，都是资产阶级腐朽没落的生活方式，二者不过是不同商标的一路货色罢了。
    《真理报》在吹嘘所谓“苏联生活方式”的时候，还假惺惺地谴责西方生活方式是什么“资本主义的痈疽”。其实，你们的所谓“苏联生活方式”又何尝不是资本主义的脓包？
