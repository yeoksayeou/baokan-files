Vice Premier Li Xiannian tonight pointed out that a resolution on the Middle East issue recently passed by the United Nations Security Council is a product of the secret talks between the head of American imperialism and the head of modern revisionism in Glassboro. He said: "In the eyes of revolutionary people, the resolutions of the UN Security Council are not worth half a penny and can only be thrown into the dustbin of history; the suppression by imperialism and the betrayal by modern revisionism will only provoke stronger counterattacks from revolutionary people."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian reiterated that the 700 million Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Arab people. He also pointed out that as long as the Arab revolutionary people persist in their struggle, they will surely win the final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. Vice Premier Li Xiannian made these remarks at a reception held by Mauritanian Ambassador to China, Harouchi, tonight.

Vice Premier Li said: "A few days ago, the UN Security Council passed a resolution on the Middle East issue. This resolution is the product of the secret talks between the head of American imperialism and the head of modern revisionism in Glassboro. It is the product of certain big powers practicing power politics in the UN." He said: "The Palestinian people, who have suffered deeply, have the right to protest. The Arab people who have been invaded have the right to protest. All revolutionary and justice-loving people around the world have the right to protest. Why should the aggressors not be condemned and punished? Why should imperialism and modern revisionism so blatantly support Israel and force Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions?"

Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that the Arab revolutionary people, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, are not afraid of imperialist suppression and will not allow modern revisionist betrayal. He said: "The struggle of the Arab people is not isolated. The 700 million Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Arab people, and all anti-imperialist revolutionary people around the world stand on the side of the Arab people. Persist and struggle on, and you will grow from small to large, from weak to strong. A single spark can start a prairie fire. No matter how difficult and tortuous the road ahead is, we believe that the Arab revolutionary people will surely win the final victory in the anti-imperialist struggle. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: 'The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone.'"

    李先念副总理指出联合国所谓中东问题决议是帝修合谋的产物
    中国人民坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边
    阿拉伯人民只要坚持斗争定会赢得反帝斗争的最后胜利
    新华社二十七日讯　李先念副总理今晚指出，几天以前联合国安理会通过的一项所谓中东问题的提案，是美帝国主义总头目和现代修正主义总头目在葛拉斯堡罗密谈的产物。他说：“在革命人民心目中，联合国安理会的决议，值不了半个铜板，只能被扔在历史的垃圾箱里；帝国主义的镇压和现代修正主义的出卖只会激起革命人民更强烈的反击。”
    李先念副总理重申七亿中国人民坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，并且指出，阿拉伯革命人民只要坚持斗争下去，一定会赢得反帝斗争的最后胜利。李先念副总理是在毛里塔尼亚驻中国大使哈尔希今晚举行的国庆招待会上讲以上这些话的。
    李副总理说：“几天以前，联合国安理会通过了一项所谓中东问题的提案。这个提案，就是美帝国主义总头目和现代修正主义总头目在葛拉斯堡罗密谈的产物。是某些大国在联合国实行强权政治的产物。”他说：“灾难深重的巴勒斯坦人民有权提出抗议。受侵略的阿拉伯人民有权提出抗议。全世界一切革命的主持正义的人民有权提出抗议。为什么侵略者可以不遭受谴责和惩罚？为什么帝国主义和现代修正主义，如此明目张胆地支持以色列，压迫阿拉伯国家接受屈辱条件！？”
    李先念副总理指出，具有光荣反帝斗争传统的阿拉伯革命人民，决不害怕帝国主义的镇压，也决不允许现代修正主义的出卖。他说：“阿拉伯人民的斗争并不孤立，七亿中国人民坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，全世界一切反帝革命人民都站在阿拉伯人民一边。坚持下去，斗争下去，就会由小变大，由弱变强。星星之火可以燎原。不管前进的道路多么艰难曲折，我们相信，阿拉伯革命人民一定会赢得反帝斗争的最后胜利。正象毛泽东主席所说的：‘世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。’”
