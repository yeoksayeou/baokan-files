Joint Learning, Joint Improvement

The fear in the world is the fear of the word "seriousness."

Chinese students studying in Albania, during their language practice in local villages, rehearsed a program in Albanian to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They succeeded only after rehearsing twice. An Albanian teacher, after watching the performance, frankly pointed out: "Do you know why the first rehearsal was not successful? It's because you were not serious. The second time, you were serious, so it went well." He then, with deep feeling, read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The world fears the word 'seriousness,' and the Communist Party values 'seriousness' the most." He added, "You must remember this quotation."

Finding Answers in "Quotations from Chairman Mao"

Albanian students often study "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and propagate Mao Zedong Thought together with Chinese students. They write the quotations in Albanian on cards and utilize every possible moment to study and memorize them, even when standing in line to buy food. They also, together with Chinese students, set up movable quotation boards on the doors of their dormitories and place quotation cards on their desks, changing them according to their study needs. They study seriously and put what they learn into practice. When they encounter difficult problems, they find answers in the quotations. During a classroom discussion, students had a debate on how to evaluate youth. At that time, a student stood up and fluently recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The world is yours, and it is also ours, but in the end, it is yours. You young people are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The future is in your hands." Everyone applauded enthusiastically, and the debate ended satisfactorily.

Encouraging Chinese Students with Quotations from Chairman Mao

A Chinese student encountered many difficulties in his studies. This was noticed by an Albanian roommate, who wrote a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations on a small card: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He then warmly gave this quotation to the Chinese student. The Chinese student was deeply moved and from then on redoubled his efforts, overcame the difficulties, and made great progress in his studies.

    共同学习　共同提高
    世界上怕就怕“认真”二字
    中国留阿尔巴尼亚学生在当地农村进行语言实习时，用阿文排练节目，宣传毛泽东思想。他们前后排演了两遍才成功。一位阿尔巴尼亚教师观看后直率地指出：“你们知道第一次没有排练好的原因吗？就是因为你们不认真。第二次你们认真了，所以就排好了。”接着，他深有体会地读了一段毛主席语录：“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”他接着说：“你们得牢牢记住这段语录。”
    从《毛主席语录》中寻找答案
    阿尔巴尼亚学生经常同中国留学生在一起学习《毛主席语录》和宣传毛泽东思想。他们把语录用阿文抄在卡片上，利用一切可以利用的时间，甚至连在排队买饭的时候也抓紧学习和背诵。他们还同中国留学生一起，在宿舍的门上装上活动语录板，在桌子上放上语录牌，根据学习的需要，随时更换语录。他们认真地学，学了就用。遇到疑难问题，他们就从语录中找答案。在一次课堂讨论时，同学们对如何估价青年这个问题发生了争论。当时，一位同学站了起来，熟练地背了一段毛主席语录：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”全体同学听了后都热烈鼓掌。一场争论也就圆满结束了。
    用毛主席语录鼓励中国同学
    一位中国留学生在学习中遇到了不少困难。这事被同房间的阿尔巴尼亚同学发现了，这位阿尔巴尼亚学生就在一个小卡片上写上一段毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”然后，他热情地把这段语录送给了中国同学。这位中国同学深受感动，从此加倍努力，克服了困难，学习有很大进步。
