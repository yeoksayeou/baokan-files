The incident took place at the Akor-Chube small railway station in the Kazakh Republic. The station master and party secretary, Korimchinka, harbored extreme hatred and subjected the female ticket seller and Communist Party member, Karavinko, to relentless persecution. He even resorted to "any means necessary" to "forge documents" and frame the female ticket seller, defaming her. Why was this happening? It turns out that this female ticket seller had exposed the "family secrets" of the station's party organization: the party secretary, Korimchinka, and some party members frequently got drunk and staggered around the nearby town. The small railway station had become a place for "bribery and distribution of spoils" and a "transit point for speculation." For example, in the summer of 1965, in a place where there were no orchards, over 20,000 kilograms of private apples were shipped out with luggage tags. Moreover, the party secretary, Korimchinka, often installed water taps for private individuals, set prices arbitrarily, and pocketed all the money. If anyone had objections, he would stop the water supply.

    为什么受迫害？
    事情发生在哈萨克共和国阿科尔—丘别小火车站。该火车站加水站站长兼党组织书记柯里姆钦卡对火车站女售票员、共产党员卡拉温科极端仇视，百般加以迫害。他甚至“不择手段地”“伪造证件”对女售票员栽赃，进行诬害。这究竟为什么呢？原来这个女售票员揭了该车站党组织的“家丑”：党组织书记柯里姆钦卡和一些党员经常喝得醉熏熏的，在车站附近的小镇上东倒西歪地晃来晃去。小火车站变成了他们“行贿分赃的场所”和“投机倒把的转运站”。例如：一九六五年夏季，在这个根本没有果园的地方竟运出挂着“行李标签”的二万多公斤私人苹果。不仅如此，党组织书记柯里姆钦科本人经常给私人安装供水龙头，自己擅自规定价格，并把所得的钱统统塞入自己的腰包，谁对他有意见，他就停止供水。
