Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to the cause of the proletarian educational revolution. Last year, he issued the great "May 7th Directive" to the people of the whole country. Recently, he has issued the latest directive: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, one must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end." These directives all have great historical and strategic significance. They are the guiding principles for China's educational cause and the fundamental measures for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Education serves politics. The bourgeoisie and their agents will inevitably transform the world according to their worldview and cultivate and produce successors to the bourgeoisie according to their worldview. The proletariat will inevitably transform the world according to the proletarian worldview and cultivate and produce successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause according to the proletarian worldview. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have consistently opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and his great directive that "education must be revolutionized." They have striven to promote the bourgeois and revisionist educational line. The facts are clear: they are doing everything they can to contend with the proletariat for the younger generation. It is on this fundamental issue that there is a sharp struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines on the educational front. Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line is the beacon for all educational work in our country. The wise decision to "serve proletarian politics, combine education with productive labor," and "develop the students in terms of ideology, intelligence, and physique, and cultivate them into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture" is the only correct path to guide the younger generation to grow steadily into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause through the great storms of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

There are also two lines in the educational revolution. One is to rely on a few so-called "authorities" and "professors" to engage in so-called "reforms" through deep thought. The facts have proven that this path is unworkable and is a false reform. The other is Chairman Mao's line of trusting and relying on the masses. By following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, relying on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers, and relying on the proletarian revolutionaries, we can definitely carry out the educational revolution and establish a new educational system. The Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven that many schools have achieved fruitful results by following Chairman Mao's directives. Our army, following Chairman Mao's great directives, has also achieved fruitful results over the past year. Schools of Mao Zedong Thought have sprung up everywhere, and good soldiers of Chairman Mao have emerged everywhere. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have become new-type soldiers of the Mao Zedong era who can fight with guns, work with hammers, farm with hoes and plows, and write articles with pens—soldiers who are both soldiers, workers, and peasants.

Chairman Mao's latest directive has given us proletarian revolutionaries a new and glorious combat mission. We firmly support the broad proletarian revolutionaries in the schools, boldly break with the old and establish the new, thoroughly smash the old educational system, and establish a proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席的教育路线永放光芒
    解放军北京部队机关无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席历来重视无产阶级教育革命事业，去年向全国人民发出了伟大的“五·七”指示，最近又发出了最新指示：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”这些指示都具有伟大的历史意义和战略意义，是我国教育事业的指针，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本措施。
    教育是为政治服务的。资产阶级和他们的代理人，必定按照他们的世界观改造世界，按照他们的世界观培养和造就资产阶级的接班人。无产阶级也必定按照无产阶级世界观改造世界，按照无产阶级世界观培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人。党内一小撮最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，反对毛主席“教育要革命”的伟大指示，竭力推行资产阶级和修正主义的教育路线。事实很清楚，他们是千方百计地同无产阶级争夺青年一代。就是在这个根本性的问题上，在教育战线上存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。我们伟大的领袖毛主席提出的无产阶级教育路线，是我国一切教育工作的指路明灯。“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”，“使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的英明决策，是引导青年一代在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动的大风大浪中，逐步锻炼成长为无产阶级革命事业接班人的唯一正确道路。
    教育革命也有两条路线。一条是靠少数所谓“权威”、“教授”去冥思苦想，进行所谓“改革”。事实证明，这一条是行不通的，是假改实不革。一条是毛主席相信群众、依靠群众的路线。按照毛主席的革命路线办事，依靠广大革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人，依靠无产阶级革命派，就一定能够真正地把教育革命搞好，建立起新的教育制度。一年多来的文化大革命证明，许多院校遵照毛主席的指示办事，已经结出了丰硕之果。我们军队遵照毛主席的伟大指示，一年多来，也结出了丰硕之果。毛泽东思想的大学校到处林立，毛主席的好战士到处涌现，广大指战员成为拿起枪杆能打仗，拿起锤子能做工，拿起锄头犁耙能种田，拿起笔杆子能写文章的亦军、亦工、亦农的毛泽东时代新型的战士。
    毛主席的最新指示，给我们无产阶级革命派以新的光荣的战斗任务。我们坚决支持学校的广大无产阶级革命派，大胆破旧立新，彻底破除旧的教育制度，建立起闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级教育制度。
