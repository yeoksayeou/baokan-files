The revolutionary teachers and students of Caochangdi Middle School in Beijing have, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, taken a valuable step towards establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism. The revolutionary practice of the teachers and students of this school has given us a beneficial enlightenment: to carry out the proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to thoroughly break with the old teacher-student relationship and establish a new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism.

The proletarian educational revolution is a thorough cultural revolution. While fundamentally reforming the old educational system, it is necessary to fundamentally change the relationships between people.

Only a new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism, based on the great Mao Zedong Thought, can mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, promote the struggle-criticism-transformation in the unit, and rapidly achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking, which is beneficial to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Without destruction, there can be no construction; without stopping, there can be no progress; without blocking, there can be no flow. To establish a new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism, it is necessary to thoroughly break with the capitalist and feudal teacher-student relationships. The old teacher-student relationship is a breeding ground for servility and a shackle that stifles the revolutionary spirit. Without breaking away from this old teacher-student relationship, the proletarian revolutionary pioneering spirit of revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers cannot be promoted; the proletarian fighting style of revolutionary teachers and students cannot be established.

The fundamental point of the new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism is that revolutionary teachers and students unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Do not set up any personal authority, but rather, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The old teacher-student relationship, although seemingly harmonious on the surface, actually has serious divisions. This relationship does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and does not conform to the revolutionary interests of the proletariat. Revolutionary teachers and students should, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, promote each other politically, help each other ideologically, learn from each other in teaching, and care for each other in life.

Revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers should unite closely and, on the great road of the proletarian educational revolution, bravely forge ahead, overcoming all difficulties!

    建立社会主义的新型师生关系
    本报评论员
    北京市草场地中学的革命师生，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，为建立社会主义的新型师生关系迈出了可贵的一步。这个学校革命师生的革命实践，给了我们一个有益的启发，这就是：为了完成无产阶级教育革命，必须大破旧的师生关系，大立社会主义的新型师生关系。
    无产阶级教育革命是一场彻底的思想文化革命，在从根本上改革旧的教育制度的同时，必须在人与人的关系上，来一个根本的改变。
    只有建立在伟大的毛泽东思想基础上的社会主义的新型师生关系，才能调动广大革命师生的革命积极性，促进本单位的斗批改；才能迅速实现人的思想革命化，有利于培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    不破不立，不止不行，不塞不流。要建立社会主义的新型师生关系，就要大破特破资本主义和封建主义的师生关系。旧的师生关系，是培养奴隶主义的温床，是扼杀革命精神的桎梏。不破除这种旧的师生关系，革命学生和革命教师的无产阶级的革命首创精神就不能发扬；革命师生的无产阶级战斗风格就不能树立起来。
    社会主义的新型师生关系，它的根本之点，就是革命师生共同团结在毛泽东思想的旗帜之下。不要树立什么个人的权威，而是要大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。旧的师生关系，表面上一团和气，实际上存在严重的隔阂。这种关系不符合毛泽东思想，不符合无产阶级的革命利益。革命的师生应该按照毛主席的教导，在政治上互相促进，思想上互相帮助，教学上互相学习，生活上互相关心。
    革命的学生和革命的教师紧密地团结起来，在无产阶级教育革命的大道上，披荆斩棘，奋勇前进！
