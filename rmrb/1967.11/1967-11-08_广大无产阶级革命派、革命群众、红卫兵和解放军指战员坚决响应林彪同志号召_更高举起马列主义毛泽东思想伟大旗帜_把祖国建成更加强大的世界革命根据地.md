The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary forces, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers and officers resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to raise high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and build our motherland into an even stronger base for world revolution.

	The great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, in his speech at the capital's rally commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, has greatly inspired the 700 million Chinese people. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, Red Guard cadres, and PLA soldiers and officers across the country have held meetings and discussions to seriously study Comrade Lin Biao's important speech, as well as the important article "Advance Along the Road Opened by the October Socialist Revolution" by the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag, and Liberation Army Daily. They enthusiastically acclaim that in the past half-century, the world has undergone earth-shaking changes, and the flames of the October Revolution have blazed across the entire globe. The situation of world revolution is excellent. They angrily condemn the Soviet revisionist renegade clique for shamelessly trampling on the great banner of Leninism, betraying the cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and committing the heinous crime of fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. They unanimously declare that they will resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, definitely raise high the great banner of the October Revolution, and the great banner of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, build our great motherland into an even stronger base for world revolution, more powerfully support the world proletariat and the peoples of all countries in their revolutionary struggles against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and more extensively spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world, so that the great cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat initiated by the October Revolution will win victory throughout the world.

	Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of PLA soldiers and officers across the country, in their study, enthusiastically acclaim that today's world has entered a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. They say, our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, put forward the great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and personally initiated and led the first great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history, bringing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Today, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution, the most fundamental and important task is to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and spread the invincible Mao Zedong Thought more extensively throughout the world. We will strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

	Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guiyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Changsha, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Urumqi, and other places indignantly say: In the Soviet Union, with Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin as representatives, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has usurped the leadership of the Soviet party and state, fully restored capitalism, and shamelessly betrayed Lenin, betrayed the great banner of the October Revolution, and betrayed the Soviet people and revolutionary peoples of the world, turning into a pile of filth despised by humanity. They have committed heinous crimes against the Soviet people and revolutionary peoples of the world. They are the most vicious enemies of the Soviet people and the common enemy of revolutionary peoples throughout the world.

	Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country point out that the true Soviet communists nurtured by great Lenin and Stalin, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, tempered and tested by the anti-fascist war, will not tolerate the Soviet revisionist renegade clique riding on their necks for long. They will rise up in revolution under the great banner of Leninism, make the red star of the October Revolution shine brightly again, and bring the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track.

	Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guard cadres across the country say, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese people have always regarded the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution and regard this as a great honor." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are currently undertaking is the higher stage of the continuation of the great October Revolution under new historical conditions. Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers in Xining, Hohhot, Taiyuan, Harbin, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanning, Kunming, Chengdu, Baoding, Anshan, Fuzhou, Xi'an, Changchun, and other places resolutely declare that they will raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions to criticize and repudiate private interests and revisionism, do a good job in revolutionary criticism and struggle, and in the rectification of their regions and units, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, promote revolution and production, support the army and love the people, further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers in the industrial and transportation systems of Beijing, Shanghai, Anshan, Qinghai, and other places say, we Chinese proletariat bear the heavy and glorious task of supporting world revolution. We must study and master Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently, grasp revolution, promote production vigorously, and build our great motherland into a strong base for world revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students across the country enthusiastically declare that they will unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution, determined to be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly eliminate the influences of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in schools, thoroughly smash the old educational system, establish a brand-new educational system of the proletariat, cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color for ten thousand generations.

	Officers, soldiers, and workers of the various headquarters, various military branches, and Beijing Garrison Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have studied Comrade Lin Biao's important speech time and time again and held lively discussions. They say, Vice Chairman Lin's speech is brimming with the radiance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and every sentence speaks the hearts of the Chinese people and the peoples of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest proletarian revolutionary theory guiding the great revolutionary movements of contemporary times. To carry the Chinese revolution and world revolution through to the end, we must strive to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Our thousandfold and ten-thousandfold support for the peoples of the world in revolution is to spread Mao Zedong Thought extensively. We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works earnestly, resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to criticize and repudiate private interests and revisionism, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and spread Mao Zedong Thought more extensively throughout the world.
