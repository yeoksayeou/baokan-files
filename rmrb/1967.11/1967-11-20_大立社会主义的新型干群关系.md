For the broad ranks of new and old revolutionary cadres, establishing a socialist new-type relationship between cadres and the masses is a major issue that concerns whether new and old revolutionary cadres can always maintain their revolutionary character, whether the revolutionary masses of the proletariat can always hold and use power correctly, whether the achievements of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat over the past year can be consolidated, and whether capitalist restoration can be prevented and our socialist state can be guaranteed to remain unchanged in color.

Cadres taking the lead in revolution and strictly demanding of themselves is the key to establishing a socialist new-type relationship between cadres and the masses.

Whether new or old revolutionary cadres, they must first insist on criticizing and repudiating oneself, and in the struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves, and deeply planting the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their hearts, wholeheartedly serving the people. They must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords riding on the heads of the people."

Establishing a socialist new-type relationship between cadres and the masses is also a matter of correctly treating new and old revolutionary cadres for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. We should start from the desire to care for and cherish new and old revolutionary cadres, carry forward the spirit of high responsibility for the revolutionary cause, and actively and positively help them do their work with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Their words and deeds, as long as they conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we must firmly support; if we find they have shortcomings and mistakes, we must promptly point them out, help them overcome shortcomings, correct mistakes, and learn lessons.

    大立社会主义的新型干群关系
    对于广大新、老革命干部说来，大立社会主义的新型干群关系，是关系到新、老革命干部能不能永远保持革命本色，关系到无产阶级革命派能不能永远掌好权、用好权，关系到能不能巩固一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的成果，关系到能不能防止资本主义复辟，保证我国的社会主义江山永不变色的大问题。
    干部带头革命，严格要求自己，是大立社会主义新型干群关系的关键。
    不论新、老革命干部，首先要坚持斗私，批修，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，在灵魂深处大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，全心全意地为人民服务。要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”
    大立社会主义的新型干群关系，对于无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众说来，也是个正确对待新、老革命干部的问题。我们应该从关心和爱护新、老革命干部的愿望出发，发扬对革命事业高度负责的精神，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，积极主动地帮助他们做好工作。他们的言论和行动，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决支持；如果发现他们有缺点错误，就及时地提出批评，帮助他们克服缺点，改正错误，吸取教训。
