The PLA Navy places the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position that is higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, significantly raising their class consciousness and political awareness. In defending the nation's maritime borders, safeguarding the Cultural Revolution, supporting the countryside, supporting the army, and building a revolutionary army, they have made new contributions to the people. In the great storm of class struggle, they have grown stronger with each battle.

Xinhua News Agency, November 14th: The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the PLA Navy is surging forward, reaching a new high tide. In the great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have consciously placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position that is higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They study, discuss, memorize, and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively. The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought has greatly raised the class consciousness and political awareness of the officers and soldiers.

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "We must build a navy. This navy must be able to defend our maritime borders and effectively resist possible imperialist aggression." Since its inception, the People's Navy has followed Chairman Mao's teachings and achieved glorious victories in defending the maritime borders. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, grasped the revolution, promoted production, work, and preparedness, and made new contributions to the people in defending the nation's maritime borders, safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supporting the countryside, supporting the army, and building a revolutionary army in various tasks.

Over the past year, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the Navy have resolutely responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school, earnestly implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and launched a more extensive and deeper mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have made new leaps in their understanding and feelings towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and their class consciousness has reached unprecedented heights. With boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration, they praise and extol the great helmsman Chairman Mao, praise and extol the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and praise and extol Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the Navy camps, at the docks, at the airports, on the front lines, in the high-altitude sentry posts, on the ships and planes, everywhere you see Chairman Mao's quotations and portraits. The officers and soldiers say: "Submarines with Chairman Mao's portrait are like having sunlight underwater; planes with Chairman Mao's portrait are brighter inside than outside; outposts with Chairman Mao's portrait are like guarding by Chairman Mao's side." From the leadership at all levels to the broad ranks of cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members, everyone places the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. The first thing they do every day is to pay respects to Chairman Mao, the first words they say are to wish Chairman Mao long life, the first song they sing is "The East Is Red," and the first activity they engage in is studying the highest directives. The mobilization meetings before ships set sail, the evaluation meetings after planes fly, and various administrative meetings and party and league life meetings within the troops have all become meetings for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many units have held lectures for hundreds and thousands of cadres and soldiers, and military-civilian lectures, with leading cadres taking the lead in lecturing.

The broad ranks of cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members regard being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the highest principle for all their actions, the highest standard for transforming their souls, and the highest ideal for their lifelong struggle. They unconditionally obey and implement every word and every letter of Chairman Mao. Many officers and soldiers on naval vessels recite Chairman Mao's teachings of "Great winds and waves are nothing to fear. Human society has developed through great winds and waves" when encountering fierce storms at sea, and everyone stands tall and proud, facing the waves crashing down on them, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" over and over again, determined to tread the vast waves. Air force officers and soldiers, when executing the battle order of "spare no effort to annihilate the invading enemy," are full of energy and extraordinarily brave, shooting down enemy planes one after another. The officers and soldiers say: In the great era of Mao Zedong Thought, the extremely glorious and great task for every proletarian revolutionary soldier is to, throughout China and the world, greatly promote the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought, letting Mao Zedong Thought shine brightly over the land.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy over the past year has been developed more extensively and deeply in the great storm of class struggle through "criticizing and repudiating revisionism."

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers deeply feel that the great proletarian cultural revolution is the best classroom for studying Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and guidelines on revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The revolutionary masses of the Navy's direct-affiliated organs "Red Alliance General Headquarters" and schools, as well as those fighting on the front lines of "supporting the countryside, supporting the army," all regard the process of overcoming every wave in the movement as a victory in studying Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The more intense and complex the struggle, the more difficult and tense the situation, the more they proactively charge forward. They say: "Studying Mao Zedong Thought in the storm of struggle is the most practical, the most profound in understanding, and the most reliable in memory." The officers and soldiers who day and night guard the maritime front lines, although burdened with extremely heavy tasks of preparedness and combat, still find ways to throw themselves into the great storm of class struggle. They say: "Thousand-mile horses cannot be found in courtyards, and ten-thousand-year pines cannot be grown in flowerpots." Many units regard the local factories, villages, and schools as classrooms for two-line struggle education, sending officers and soldiers in batches to face the wind and rain, experience the world, live, work, study Chairman Mao's works, and carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle with local revolutionary masses. Some units' family committees also organize family members to take Chairman Mao's works to the countryside to participate in the revolutionary struggle of poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, workers, and family members study struggle in struggle and swim in swimming, greatly raising their awareness of implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, increasingly understanding the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and increasingly recognizing that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road with China's Khrushchev as the head are the most dangerous enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Because they have recognized the great significance of carrying out revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, they more closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, consciously implement and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and with the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, implement Chairman Mao's latest directives.

The officers and soldiers regard the great storm of the Cultural Revolution as the best battlefield for sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls and launching a fierce attack on the "self." They say: "The line struggle is the most intense in the Cultural Revolution, the public and private are the most distinct, the soul is the most profoundly touched, and only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and fiercely fighting the 'self' can one keep up with the situation forever." Therefore, they consciously use the "Three Articles" as weapons, with the spirit of continuous revolution, launching a fierce attack on the "self." The officers and soldiers deeply feel from the struggle practice that only by continuously and fiercely fighting the various selfish thoughts exposed in the great storm of class struggle can one always have a clear direction, bright eyes, grow stronger in battle, truly integrate the great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line into one's blood and soul.

    把活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上
    海军部队大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威
    文化大革命以来，广大指战员更加大学大用毛主席著作，极大地提高了阶级觉悟和思想政治水平。在保卫祖国海防、保卫文化大革命，在“三支”“两军”和部队革命化建设方面，为人民立下新功，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，越战越强。
    新华社十四日讯　中国人民解放军海军部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动波澜壮阔，出现了新高潮。广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争中，自觉地把活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上，大学、大讲、大背、大用。光焰无际的毛泽东思想的大普及，极大地提高了指战员们的阶级觉悟和思想政治水平。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“我们一定要建设一支海军，这支海军要能保卫我们的海防，有效地防御帝国主义的可能的侵略”。人民海军从诞生的那天起，遵循毛主席的教导，在保卫海防的斗争中，立下了辉煌战功。无产阶级文化大革命以来，广大指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，在保卫祖国海防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，在“三支”“两军”和部队革命化建设等各项工作中，又为人民立下了新功。
    一年多来，海军部队广大指战员坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的号召，认真贯彻林副主席关于把学习毛主席著作提高到新的阶段的指示，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，掀起了更加广泛、更加深入的活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮。广大指战员对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线，在认识和感情上，发生了新的飞跃，阶级觉悟空前提高。他们怀着无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，大赞大颂伟大统帅毛主席，大赞大颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，大赞大颂毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在海军营区，在码头，在机场，在前沿阵地，高山哨所，在舰艇和飞机上，到处都是毛主席语录、毛主席像。指战员说：“潜艇挂上毛主席像，水下一片太阳光；飞机挂上毛主席像，舱里更比舱外亮；阵地挂上毛主席像，好象守卫在毛主席身旁。”从各级领导干部到广大干部、战士、职工、家属，都把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，每天第一件事是向毛主席致敬，第一句话是敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，第一支歌是高唱《东方红》，第一次活动是学习最高指示。舰艇出海前的动员会，飞机飞行后的讲评会，以及部队里的各种行政会议和党团生活会，都变成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，不少部队还召开成百上千人的干部战士讲用会和军民讲用会，领导干部带头讲用。
    广大干部、战士、职工、家属把无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，作为自己一切行动的最高纲领，改造灵魂的最高标准，终身奋斗的最高理想。他们对毛主席的每一句话、每一个字，都坚决服从，坚决照办。许多舰艇部队指战员在海上巡逻遇到狂风恶浪时，背诵起毛主席教导的“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”就人人昂首挺胸，迎着劈头盖脑打过来的海水，一遍又一遍高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，决心踩下万顷巨浪。航空兵指战员执行“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的战斗命令时，浑身是劲，勇猛异常，击落了一架又一架入侵的敌机。指战员们说：在世界进入了伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，每一个无产阶级革命战士极其光荣而伟大的任务，就是要在全中国和全世界，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想光辉普照大地。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”海军部队这一年多来的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，就是在阶级斗争的大风大浪中通过“斗私，批修”，更广泛、更深入地发展起来的。
    广大指战员深深体会到，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，是学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策的最好的课堂。海军直属机关“红联总”和院校的无产阶级革命派，以及战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的人员，都把战胜运动中每一个风浪的过程，看成是学习毛主席革命路线的胜利。斗争越是尖锐复杂，情况越是艰苦紧张，他们越是主动迎上去。他们说：“在斗争的风浪中学习毛泽东思想，学得最实际，领会得最深刻，记得最牢靠。”日夜警惕地守卫在海防前线的指战员们，虽然担负着极其繁重的战备、战斗任务，仍然想方设法投身到阶级斗争大风浪中。他们说：“庭院里蹓不出千里马，花盆里养不出万年松。”许多部队把驻地工厂、农村和学校，当作两条路线斗争教育的课堂，分期分批地让指战员去经风雨、见世面，跟地方革命派同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习毛主席著作，同开展革命大批判。有些部队的家属委员会，还组织家属带着毛主席著作到农村去参加贫下中农的革命斗争。广大指战员、职工、家属在斗争中学习斗争，在游泳中学习游泳，大大提高了执行毛主席革命路线的自觉性，越来越深刻地懂得无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，越来越认清了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人。由于他们认清了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的伟大意义，他们更加紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，自觉地执行和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，对毛主席的每一个最新指示，都以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的速度贯彻执行。
    指战员们把文化大革命的大风大浪，看成是在灵魂深处爆发革命，向“私”字大打进攻战的最好的战场。他们说：“文化大革命中路线斗争最激烈，大公大私最分明，触及灵魂最深刻，只有活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗私字，才能使自己永远跟上形势。”因此都自觉地以“老三篇”为武器，用不断革命的精神，向“私”字猛烈进攻。指战员们从斗争实践中深深体会到，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中只有不断猛斗暴露出来的各种私心，才能始终方向明，眼睛亮，越战越强，真正把伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线溶进血液里，化为自己的灵魂。
