The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to consolidate its reactionary rule and to cultivate successors to revisionism, has been vigorously promoting bourgeois goods in the field of education and implementing a full set of revisionist lines.

The struggle for the hearts and minds of the youth has always been a crucial aspect of the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The Soviet revisionist clique, representing the new bourgeoisie of the Soviet Union, after seizing the party and government power, has paid particular attention to controlling the educational front. They have turned schools into important venues for peddling revisionist ideology, using various methods to corrupt and poison the younger generation.

Lenin once said, "The youth must link every step of their learning, education, and training with the ongoing struggle of the proletariat and laborers against the old exploitative society to learn communism." The Soviet revisionist clique, under the banner of "communist education" for the youth, actually educates and trains them in capitalism.

To train young people into bourgeois intellectuals, the Soviet revisionist clique makes students detached from labor, detached from the masses, and detached from reality. At the same time, they relentlessly instill revisionist thoughts, bourgeois selfishness, and a lifestyle of eating, drinking, and entertainment. In short, they strive to "educate" the youth into genuine revisionists to inherit their legacy and maintain their reactionary rule.

However, the Soviet people and youth are increasingly recognizing the reactionary nature of the Soviet revisionist clique. They will surely rise up to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, smash the revisionist educational system, and truly follow Lenin's teachings to strive for the learning of communism.

To meet the needs of a thorough restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionist leadership has fully implemented the bourgeois school management policy and the revisionist educational line in the field of education.

"Expert Rule in Schools"

The Soviet revisionist clique vigorously promotes the bourgeois policy of "expert rule in schools," turning schools into domains ruled by bourgeois scholars. These people's bourgeois worldview is entirely in sync with the Soviet revisionist clique's policy of restoring capitalism, making them faithful tools for the Soviet revisionist clique to implement the revisionist educational line.

In schools, bourgeois "experts" act arbitrarily and monopolize everything. According to Soviet revisionist publications, "In the 39-member party committee of Moscow University, 30 members are professors and associate professors. The situation in the party organizations of various departments is the same." Moreover, positions of power such as university presidents and deans are exclusively held by professors and doctors.

These people enjoy various privileges, the more academic and professional titles they have, the greater their privileges, and their income is tens of times higher than that of ordinary workers.

"Intellectual Education First"

To cultivate successors to revisionism, the Soviet revisionist clique vigorously promotes the reactionary policy of "intellectual education first" in schools. One of the Soviet revisionist leaders, Mazurov, advocated this year at the All-Soviet Conference of Higher Education Workers that the task of Soviet students is to "master their profession." The Minister of Higher and Specialized Secondary Education, Yelutin, also said that "the basic requirement for young people when entering university is to have profound and solid knowledge." This means that the sole criterion for admitting new students is their scores.

While promoting "intellectual education first" in schools, the Soviet revisionist clique vigorously excludes labor education. An article by a deputy professor in *Pravda* openly opposes labor education, saying, "Doesn't intellectual labor also temper will and character?" An editorial in the same newspaper openly advocates that "the practice of elementary school students participating in seasonal labor is harmful to education."

Poisoning Minds

To meet the needs of restoring capitalism, the Soviet revisionist clique injects a large amount of revisionist poison into students through teaching. The textbooks they compile, such as *History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union*, *Principles of Marxism*, *Principles of Marxist Philosophy*, and the new courses they open, such as *Sociology* and *Principles of Communism*, are all anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionist junk. These textbooks advocate that communism is "humanitarian," fiercely attack Stalin and the dictatorship of the proletariat, peddle the fallacies of the "party of the whole people" and the "state of the whole people," and create "theory" for the restoration of capitalism.

The various "professional" courses set up by the Soviet revisionist clique in schools also serve the restoration of capitalism. For example, after the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1965 passed the decision to vigorously promote the "new management system" for the restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionists immediately decided to open dozens of new economics departments in various higher education institutions in the Soviet Union, to open higher economics schools in several major cities, and to train a large number of "economists" who can implement this policy of restoring capitalism. Bourgeois reactionary "authorities" also responded enthusiastically, compiling new economics textbooks and reference books that advocate the restoration of capitalism.

Pursuit of Fame and Profit

The Soviet revisionist clique poisons the younger generation with bourgeois ideas of fame and profit. Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev openly advocates that the purpose of going to school is to become a "specialist" and an "official." Kosygin also said that young people should become "outstanding scientists listed in the world's scientific history and talented young scientists."

The Soviet revisionist clique has taken various measures to promote the pursuit of fame and profit among students through "material incentives." They use the bourgeois "academic title" system to "stimulate" scientific researchers. Writing a so-called "academic paper" that is appreciated by the Soviet revisionist clique can lead to obtaining some kind of "academic title." Once an "academic title" is obtained, the salary can be significantly increased, reaping both fame and profit. To cultivate successors to revisionism, the Soviet revisionist clique also opened so-called "experimental secondary schools" to cultivate "geniuses" and conducted a "Siberian Olympiad" composed of three rounds of examinations throughout Siberia to select so-called "genius" students. An article by a university president published in *Pravda* openly advocates using "economic incentives" to improve the "quality of higher education." In the Soviet Union, students' scholarships and stipends are distributed based on their scores, with higher scores receiving more money and lower scores receiving less or even having their stipends deducted. Last year, when the *Komsomolskaya Pravda* decided to establish scholarships for five teacher training colleges, it explicitly stipulated that scholarships should be awarded "based on examination results."

However, even Soviet publications have to admit that the Soviet revisionist clique's revisionist education has encountered "certain difficulties," and Soviet youth have developed "nihilism and skepticism" towards the Soviet revisionist clique. The Soviet people and youth will surely rise up to smash the Soviet revisionist clique's revisionist educational system along with the Soviet revisionist clique itself.

### 苏修集团推行修正主义教育路线的形形色色

    苏修集团推行修正主义教育路线的形形色色
    编者按：苏修叛徒集团为了巩固它的反动统治，为了培养修正主义的接班人，在教育方面大力推销资产阶级货色，实行一整套修正主义路线。
    争夺青年人，一直是资产阶级同无产阶级搏斗的一个重要内容。代表苏联新资产阶级的苏修集团，篡夺了苏联党政大权以后，更是十分注意霸占教育这个阵地。他们把学校作为贩卖修正主义思想的重要场所，采取各种方式腐蚀和毒害青年一代。
    列宁说过：“青年们只有把自己学习、教育和训练中的每一步骤同无产者和劳动者不断进行的反对旧的剥削者社会的斗争联系起来，才能学习共产主义。”苏修集团打着对青年进行“共产主义教育”的招牌，实际上却对青年进行资本主义的教育和训练。
    苏修集团为了把青少年教育和训练成资产阶级知识分子，就使学生脱离劳动、脱离群众、脱离实际，同时拚命向他们灌输修正主义思想、资产阶级的利己主义和吃喝玩乐的生活方式。一句话，他们极力要把青年“教育”成地地道道的修正主义者，来继承他们的衣钵，维持他们的反动统治。
    但是，苏联人民和青年正在日益认清苏修集团的反动面目，他们一定会起来推翻苏修集团的反动统治，砸烂修正主义的教育制度，真正按照列宁的遗训，努力学习共产主义。
    苏修领导集团为了适应彻底复辟资本主义的需要，在教育方面全面推行资产阶级办校方针和修正主义教育路线。
    “专家治校”
    苏修集团竭力推行资产阶级的“专家治校”的办校方针，使学校成了资产阶级学阀统治的天下。这伙人的资产阶级世界观同苏修集团的复辟资本主义的政策完全合拍，他们是苏修集团推行修正主义教育路线的忠实工具。
    在学校中，资产阶级“专家”们独断专行，垄断一切。据苏修报刊透露，“在莫斯科大学的三十九人组成的党委会中，有三十名委员是教授和副教授。各系的党组织的情况也是如此。”而执掌大权的大学校长、学院院长等职位，更是非教授、博士之类人物就不能担任。
    这伙人享有各种各样的特权，学衔和职衔越多，特权就越大，他们的收入要比普通工人高几十倍。
    “智育第一”
    为了培养修正主义接班人，苏修集团在学校中大力推行为反动政治服务的“智育第一”的方针。苏修头目之一马祖罗夫今年在全苏高等学校工作人员会议上鼓吹，苏联学生的任务就是“熟悉业务”。苏修高等和中等专业教育部部长叶留金还说什么“在入大学的时候，向青年提出的基本要求是：具有深刻而牢固的知识”。这也就是说，录取新生的唯一标准就是分数。
    苏修集团在学校中推行“智育第一”的同时，竭力排斥劳动教育。《真理报》刊载的一个副教授的文章，就公然反对劳动教育，说什么“难道脑力劳动就不锻炼意志和性格吗？”这家报纸的一篇社论还公开宣扬：“小学生参加季节性劳动的作法，对教育是有害的。”
    灌输毒素
    苏修集团为了复辟资本主义的需要，在教学中向学生大量灌输修正主义毒素。他们编制的《苏联共产党历史》、《马克思主义原理》、《马克思主义哲学原理》等等教科书，以及他们新开设的《社会学》、《共产主义原理》等课程，都是些反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的修正主义黑货。这些教科书鼓吹什么共产主义就是“人道”，大反斯大林和无产阶级专政，贩卖“全民党”、“全民国家”的谬论，为资本主义复辟制造“理论”。
    苏修集团在学校中设置的一些“专业”课程，也是为资本主义复辟服务的。例如，一九六五年，苏共中央九月全会通过了大力推行复辟资本主义的“新管理体制”以后，苏修立即决定在苏联各高等院校开设数十个新的经济系，在好几个大城市开设高等经济学校，大量培养能够贯彻这种复辟资本主义方针的“经济师”。资产阶级反动“权威”们也纷纷响应，编制鼓吹资本主义复辟的新的经济教科书和参考书。
    追逐名利
    苏修集团用资产阶级名利思想毒害青年一代。苏修头目勃列日涅夫公开鼓吹，上学就是为了当“专家”，当“干部”。柯西金还说什么，青年要当“名列世界科学史册的杰出科学家以及天才的青年科学家”。
    苏修集团采取了不少措施，大搞“物质刺激”来鼓励学生追名逐利。他们用资产阶级的“学衔”制度来“刺激”科研人员。写了一篇得到苏修集团赏识的所谓“学术论文”，就有可能得到这样或那样的“学衔”。一有了“学衔”，工资马上可以大大增加，名利双收。苏修集团为了培养修正主义接班人，还开设了专门培养“天才”的所谓“试验性中等学校”，在全西伯利亚进行由三轮考试组成的“西伯利亚奥林匹克”来选拔所谓“天才”学生。《真理报》刊载的一位大学校长的文章，公开鼓吹以“经济刺激”来提高“高等学校教育质量”。在苏联，学生的助学金、奖学金就是根据分数发的，分数高的得钱多，分数低的得钱少以至扣发助学金。苏联《共青团真理报》去年决定为五所师范学院设立奖学金时明确规定，奖学金“根据考试结果”颁发。
    但是，即使苏联报刊也不得不承认，苏修集团的这种修正主义教育，遇到了“一定的困难”，苏联青年已对苏修集团产生了“虚无主义和怀疑主义”。苏联人民和青年一定会奋起将苏修的修正主义教育制度连同苏修叛徒集团一起统统砸烂。
