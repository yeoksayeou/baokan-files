The United Nations General Assembly began debating the so-called "Chinese representation issue" on the 20th. On the 21st, Albanian representative Halim Budha spoke at the meeting, reaffirming the Albanian government and people's demand to immediately restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and expel the Kuomintang clique's "representatives" from the United Nations organizations. He enthusiastically praised China's foreign policy and the great achievements of the Chinese people, especially the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Budha also cited facts to strongly expose the sinister conspiracy of US imperialism and Soviet revisionism to collaborate against China, refuting the malicious anti-China fallacies of US imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and a few of their followers.

Budha said: Over the past 18 years, the great Chinese people have achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. China has become a major factor in maintaining international peace and security. She resolutely fights against the aggression and war policies of the US imperialists and their accomplices, unconditionally supports the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the peoples of all countries, and the revolutionary movements of the world for freedom, independence, and social progress. Great socialist China is today an impregnable fortress for all revolutionary and progressive forces in the world. Because of her firm Marxist-Leninist stance and her unwavering struggle for freedom and peace, she has won the sympathy and trust of the entire progressive humanity. China has developed atomic bombs, missiles, and recently hydrogen bombs, further breaking the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism, and dealing a heavy blow to the nuclear blackmail of the imperialist-revisionists. This is a great encouragement to the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples and countries of the world.

Budha went on to point out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved brilliant victories, which "have shattered the last illusions of the imperialists and revisionists to restore capitalism and the old colonial system in China. It has inspired the freedom-loving peoples of all countries, further enhancing and strengthening their courage and determination to fight against imperialism. More and more people are resolutely supporting socialist China, and the influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution in the world is increasingly great."

Budha pointed out that for this reason, US imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries have further intensified their collusion against China. He condemned the US imperialists for their consistent hostility towards the great Chinese people, constantly provoking China, and even building a military encirclement around China and threatening to launch an invasion.

Budha went on to say: "The criminal policy of the US ruling clique is increasingly supported by the Soviet revisionist clique, which has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the interests and wishes of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership openly colludes with US imperialism against China, shamelessly betraying the just cause of the Vietnamese and Arab peoples, indicating that this gang of traitors has today become the number one ally of US imperialism in implementing its anti-China policy and suppressing the national liberation and social liberation revolutionary movements of various countries. US imperialism and Soviet revisionism have today formed a counter-revolutionary 'holy alliance' to rally all reactionary and decadent forces around them."

When discussing the current state of the United Nations organization, Budha said, due to the manipulation of US imperialism and the collusion of the US and the Soviet Union, "the United Nations organization has today become an instrument serving the imperialist policy of aggression and oppression of various countries, and a center for trading the cause of the freedom-loving and peace-loving countries and peoples of the world."

Budha pointed out that the US imperialists have used various tricks to exclude the true representatives of 700 million Chinese people from the United Nations organization for a long time, which is unacceptable. He solemnly pointed out: There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is a province of China and an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The conspiracy of the so-called 'two Chinas' is doomed to complete failure.

In his speech, Budha also exposed the two-faced tactics of the Soviet revisionists on the issue of Chinese representation. He pointed out: "The Soviet revisionists, on the one hand, pretended to support the restoration of China's rights at the previous session, while at the same time, just before the vote on this issue, they distributed a 'Pravda' article here that maliciously slandered the People's Republic of China. This is one of the many examples of how the two superpowers collude to carry out anti-China activities."

    阿尔巴尼亚代表在联合国强烈谴责美帝苏修敌视中国的罪恶阴谋
    社会主义中国是世界革命力量的坚强堡垒
    任何反华活动和制造所谓“两个中国”的阴谋注定要彻底失败
    新华社二十四日讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：联合国大会从二十日起辩论所谓“中国代表权问题”。阿尔巴尼亚代表哈利姆·布多在二十一日的会议上发言，重申了阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民要求立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的一切合法权利，同时把蒋介石匪帮的“代表”从联合国机构中驱逐出去的严正立场。他热情赞扬中国的外交政策及中国人民所取得的巨大成就，特别是毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。布多还列举事实，有力地揭露了美帝苏修合伙反华的罪恶阴谋，驳斥了美帝、苏修及其一小撮追随者的恶毒反华谬论。
    布多说：十八年来，伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设的各个方面都取得了无比辉煌的成就，中国“已成为维护国际和平与安全的一个重大因素，她坚决地同美帝及其同伙的侵略和战争政策作斗争，无保留地支持各国人民反帝反殖的斗争，以及全世界争取自由、独立和社会进步的革命运动。伟大的社会主义中国，今天是世界上一切革命的和进步的力量的不可攻克的堡垒。由于她采取坚定的马列主义立场，为自由与和平事业进行坚持不懈的斗争，她得到了整个进步人类的同情和信任。中国拥有了原子弹，导弹，最近又拥有了氢弹，从而进一步打破了帝国主义和修正主义的核垄断，给予帝修的核讹诈以沉重打击，这是对爱好和平与自由的各国人民和国家的巨大鼓舞。”
    布多接着指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了辉煌的胜利，这一胜利“使帝国主义者和修正主义者妄图在中国复辟资本主义和旧的殖民制度的最后迷梦永远破灭了。它鼓舞了爱好自由的各国人民，进一步提高和加强了他们进行反帝斗争的勇气和决心。越来越多的人日益坚决地支持社会主义的中国，中国无产阶级文化革命在世界上的影响越来越大。”
    布多指出，正因为这样，美帝国主义者、苏联修正主义者和各国反动派，进一步加紧勾结反华。他谴责美帝国主义者一贯敌视伟大的中国人民，不断对中国进行挑衅，甚至在中国周围建立军事包围圈和以发动一场侵略战争相威胁。
    布多接着指出：“美国统治集团的这种罪恶政策，越来越得到背叛了马克思列宁主义、背叛了苏联各族人民和世界各国人民的切身利益和愿望的苏联修正主义集团的积极支持。”他指出，苏修领导集团公然勾结美帝反华，无耻地背叛越南人民和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争事业表明，这伙叛徒今天“已经成为美帝国主义推行它的反华和镇压各国人民的民族解放和社会解放的革命运动的政策的头号同盟军。美帝国主义和苏联修正主义今天已经结成了把世界上一切反动和腐朽势力纠集在它们周围的反革命‘神圣同盟’。”
    在谈到联合国组织的现状时，布多说，由于美帝的操纵和美苏勾结，“联合国组织今天已变成了一个为侵略和压迫各国人民的帝国主义政策服务的工具，变成了一个用爱好自由与和平的各国人民和国家的事业来作交易的中心”。
    布多指出，美帝使用种种阴谋诡计，长期把七亿中国人民的真正代表排除在联合国组织之外，这是不可容忍的。他严正指出：在世界上只有一个中国，这就是中华人民共和国，台湾是中国的一个省，是中华人民共和国领土不可分割的一部分，所谓“两个中国”的阴谋是注定要彻底失败的。
    布多在发言中还揭露了苏修在中国代表权问题上的两面手法。他指出：“苏联修正主义者在上届会议上，一方面假装支持恢复中国的权利，同时正好在就这个问题进行表决的前夕，在这里大肆散发《真理报》的一篇竭力诬蔑中华人民共和国的文章。这是突出地说明（美苏）两大国如何勾结在一起进行反华活动的许多事例之一”。
