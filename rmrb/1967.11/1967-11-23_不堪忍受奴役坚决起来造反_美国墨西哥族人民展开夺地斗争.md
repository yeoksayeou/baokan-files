The Mexican people residing in the southwestern United States, unable to endure their long-standing plight of unreasonable discrimination and brutal exploitation, have continuously launched a massive struggle to reclaim nearly 100 million acres of land that American white landlords seized from their ancestors over a hundred years ago. The struggle of the Mexican people has made the American ruling class anxious.

Since the early 1960s, the impoverished Mexican people living in New Mexico and Colorado states have organized to demand the return of their ancestral lands. According to scattered reports from American bourgeois newspapers this spring, the number of Mexican people participating in this struggle has already exceeded 30,000. Starting from last autumn, they have had multiple violent clashes with the police and once occupied a large forest in the northern part of New Mexico, establishing their own governing institutions.

In May of this year, in the small town of Tierra Amarilla in New Mexico, over 500 Mexican residents held a meeting, declaring their undisputed legal right to nearly 200,000 acres of land in the area. At the meeting, they elected a body to manage the town's administrative affairs and a militia commander. The reactionary ruling authorities in the United States carried out a frenzied suppression of this revolutionary action, arresting the leaders elected by the masses. Subsequently, in early June, hundreds of Mexican people launched a brave and clever surprise attack on the town, breaking into the county courthouse, killing the guarding police, freeing the detainees, and then calmly retreated to the mountainous areas in the northern part of New Mexico.

The reactionary ruling authorities, frightened by the revolutionary rebellion of the Mexican people, hastily dispatched 400 members of the "National Guard," equipped with tanks, to suppress the struggle. However, many soldiers of the "National Guard" refused to harm their own relatives and neighbors. The reactionary authorities had no choice but to send in a large number of state police the next day to carry out a reign of white terror, making arbitrary arrests and killings, temporarily suppressing the armed resistance struggle that the Mexican people had just launched.

The struggle of the Mexican residents in Tierra Amarilla gained active support from the broad masses of Mexican people in other regions of New Mexico and Colorado. They held marches and demonstrations to protest against the fascist atrocities of the reactionary authorities.

    不堪忍受奴役坚决起来造反
    美国墨西哥族人民展开夺地斗争
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：在美国西南部居住的墨西哥族人民，由于无法继续忍受他们长期遭受无理歧视和残酷剥削的悲惨处境，不断地掀起轰轰烈烈的夺地斗争，要求收回美国白人地主在一百多年前从他们祖辈手里夺去的近一亿英亩土地。墨西哥族人民的斗争使得美国统治集团惶惶不安。
    居住在美国新墨西哥州和科罗拉多州的墨西哥族贫苦人民，自六十年代初以来就先后组织起来，要求收回他们祖辈原有的土地。根据美国资产阶级报刊今年春天以来零星透露的材料，目前参加这一斗争的墨西哥族人民，已经超过三万人。从去年秋天起，他们曾经多次同警察发生激烈冲突，并曾一度占领新墨西哥州北部的一处大森林，建立起自己的政权机构。
    今年五月，在新墨西哥州的一个小镇蒂拉阿马里拉，五百多名墨西哥族居民举行了一次大会，宣布他们对当地近二十万英亩土地拥有无可争辩的合法继承权。会上选出了管理全镇行政事务的机构和民兵队长。美国反动统治当局对这种革命行动进行了疯狂的镇压，逮捕了群众选出的领导人。接着，在今年六月初，数百名墨西哥族人对这个小镇发动了一次勇敢而机智的突然袭击，打开县法院，打死守卫的警察，放出了被捕者，然后从容地撤退到新墨西哥州北部的山区。
    被墨西哥族人民的革命造反行动吓慌了的反动统治当局，急忙派出了四百名“国民警卫队”，开着坦克前去镇压。但是许多“国民警卫队”的士兵拒绝残害自己的亲友近邻。反动当局不得不在第二天改派了大批州的警察部队开进那个地区，疯狂地实行白色恐怖，滥捕滥杀，把墨西哥族人民刚刚掀起的一场武装抗暴斗争暂时压了下去。
    蒂拉阿马里拉镇墨西哥族居民的斗争，获得了新墨西哥州其他地区和科罗拉多州广大墨西哥族人民的积极声援。他们纷纷举行游行示威，抗议反动当局的法西斯暴行。
