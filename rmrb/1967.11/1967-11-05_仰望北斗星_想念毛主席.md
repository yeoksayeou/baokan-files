Gazing at the Big Dipper, Missing Chairman Mao

The Most Precious Souvenir

In a factory in Mali, a group of Chinese experts were about to return to China. This news reached a workshop director. The next day, he went early to visit the Chinese experts. Words could not express his deep affection and reluctance to part with them. As he was leaving, he said excitedly, "You are leaving, and I will no longer be able to receive your help. I am very sad. But I have thought it over all night and have come to understand. Please rest assured. Because you have left me the most precious souvenir: the works of Chairman Mao. I firmly believe that relying on Mao Zedong Thought, I will definitely overcome all difficulties and do a good job."

A Meaningful Gift

When Chinese students in France were about to leave France to return to China to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a French youth pondered, "What meaningful gift should I give them?" Later, she thought, "Chinese classmates often say, 'When encountering problems, first consult Chairman Mao.' So she took out the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and studied it carefully, finally finding a satisfactory answer. The next morning, she eagerly ran to find the Chinese students and said as soon as she entered the door, "Chinese classmates, you are the Red Guards of Chairman Mao. I have brought you a precious gift!" It turned out to be a flat, round, crystal-clear and beautiful sea stone, with a bright red five-pointed star engraved on it. She explained to the Chinese students, "Chairman Mao teaches us that the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the midst of the masses' struggles and are tempered and grown in the great storms of revolution. This stone was specially selected by me from the seaside. It has withstood countless winds and waves. You are about to return to China to participate in the great proletarian cultural revolution. I hope you will follow Chairman Mao's instructions and temper and grow in the great storms!"

"You Know Me Too Well"

When Chinese students in Algeria were about to return to China, at the invitation of an Algerian classmate, they went to his home to chat. The host took out a camera and pulled the Chinese students to stand in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. He said, "You are about to return to Chairman Mao's side. Let's take a meaningful farewell photo in front of Chairman Mao's portrait!" Before parting, the Chinese students gave him a French version of "On Contradiction" that he had long been looking forward to. He happily said, "You know me too well. I really want this book. Chairman Mao's thoughts are not only applicable to China but also to all countries in the world. Chairman Mao's works are a further development of Marxism-Leninism." Finally, he earnestly requested that the Chinese students write in Chinese on the cover: "Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution in China!" "Long live the unity of the people of the world!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Being a Good Student of Chairman Mao

When Chinese students were returning to China from the German Democratic Republic, many Asian, African, and Latin American students came to see them off. An African student repeatedly urged the Chinese students, "Please convey to Chairman Mao that we are reading his books, and we want to be his good students." His words expressed the sentiments of all progressive students in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    仰望北斗星　想念毛主席
    最珍贵的纪念品
    在马里的一个工厂里，有一批中国专家即将回国。这消息传到了一位车间主任那里。第二天，他一早就去看望中国专家。千言万语也说不尽他对中国专家依依惜别的深情。在临走时，他激动地说：“你们要走了，我再也得不到你们的帮助了，我心里非常难过。可是，我翻来复去想了一整夜，还是想通了。请你们放心吧！因为你们已经给我留下了最宝贵的纪念品：毛主席著作。我深信，依靠毛泽东思想，我一定会克服一切困难，做好工作。”
      有意义的礼物
    当中国留法学生快要离开法国回国参加无产阶级文化大革命的时候，一位法国青年左思右想：“送给他们什么有意义的礼品呢？”后来她想到：中国同学常说，“遇到问题首先向毛主席请教。”于是她拿出了《毛主席语录》，认真地学了起来，终于找到了满意的答案。次日清晨，她兴冲冲地跑来找中国同学，一进门就说：“中国同学们，你们是毛主席的红卫兵，我给你们带来了一件珍贵的礼物！”原来那是一块扁圆形的晶莹美丽的海石，上面镶刻着一颗鲜红鲜红的五角星。她对中国同学解释说：“毛主席教导我们，无产阶级革命事业的接班人是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命的大风大浪中锻炼成长的。这块石头是我特地从海边选来的，它经受过无数次风吹浪打。你们就要回国参加伟大的无产阶级文化大革命了，希望你们遵照毛主席的指示，在大风大浪中锻炼成长！”
     “你们太了解我了”
    中国留阿尔及利亚学生在快要回国的时候，应一位阿尔及利亚同学的盛情邀请，到他家去叙一叙。主人拿着照相机，拉着中国同学一起走到毛主席像前，他说：“你们就要回到毛主席身边了，让咱们一起在毛主席像前照个相吧，这是最有意义的临别纪念！”
    临别前，中国同学送给了他一本他盼望已久的法文版《矛盾论》。他接到宝书后高兴地说：“你们太了解我了，我非常想得到这本书。毛主席的思想不仅适用于中国，而且适用于世界各国。毛主席著作，是对马克思列宁主义的进一步发展。”最后他恳切地请求中国同学在封面上写上中文：“伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“世界人民大团结万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
      做毛主席的好学生
    中国留学生从德意志民主共和国回国的时候，许多亚、非、拉留学生都前去送行。一位非洲同学再三嘱咐中国同学说：“请你们转告毛主席他老人家，我们正在读他的书，我们要做他老人家的好学生。”他的话表达了亚、非、拉所有进步学生的心意。
