After World War II, the people of South Yemen (the British colonial territory of Aden and its protectorates) intensified their struggle for national liberation. The cunning British imperialists constantly concocted new neo-colonialist plots, attempting to divide and weaken the burgeoning national liberation movement in South Yemen. In February 1959, the British imperialists orchestrated the creation of a puppet "Federation of South Arabia," which was part of this malicious scheme.

The "Federation of South Arabia" consists of seventeen member states. Apart from the Aden colony, the rest are sultanates and emirates from the "East Aden Protectorate" and the "West Aden Protectorate."

The "East and West Aden Protectorates" are products of British imperialist colonial rule. In 1839, the British imperialists seized the port of Aden in South Yemen by force and used it as a colonial stronghold to expand into neighboring regions. At the same time, to strengthen their colonial rule, the British imperialists adopted a divide-and-conquer strategy, arbitrarily dividing the South Yemen region into the Aden colony and the "East and West Aden Protectorates." Thus, the so-called "East and West Aden Protectorates" were artificially created by British imperialism.

    “南阿拉伯联邦”和“东、西亚丁保护地”
    第二次世界大战后，南也门（即英帝占领下的亚丁殖民地和保护地）人民争取民族解放的斗争日益高涨。老奸巨猾的英帝国主义不断玩弄新殖民主义阴谋，妄图分化和瓦解南也门人民蓬勃发展的民族解放运动。一九五九年二月，英帝国主义一手操纵，拼凑了一个傀儡“南阿拉伯联邦”，就是这个恶毒阴谋的一部分。
    “南阿拉伯联邦”共有十七个成员。其中除亚丁殖民地外，其余都是“东亚丁保护地”和“西亚丁保护地”的苏丹国和酋长国。
    “东、西亚丁保护地”是英帝国主义殖民统治的产物。一八三九年，英帝国主义用武力强占了南也门的亚丁港后，就以亚丁作为其殖民据点，对邻近地区大肆扩张。同时，英帝国主义为加强其殖民统治，便采取分而治之的阴险手段，硬把南也门地区分成亚丁殖民地和“东、西亚丁保护地”三个部分，因而所谓“东、西亚丁保护地”就是这样被英帝国主义人为地制造出来的。
