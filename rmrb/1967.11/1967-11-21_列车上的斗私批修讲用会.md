The struggle against selfishness and revisionism on the train took place on the 71st passenger train from Beijing to Jilin. The passengers on the train came from all over the country, including men and women, old and young, from various professions. They gathered together and formed a combat unit, resolutely and seriously executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, turning the train car into a battlefield for the struggle against selfishness and revisionism. From this, one can clearly see: after more than a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people's ideological revolution has reached a new level. Everyone is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advancing victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

The 71st passenger train, departing from the world revolutionary center Beijing and heading towards the northern city of Jilin, was rushing forward under the bright morning sun.

The passengers in the train car, holding the red book of Chairman Mao's Quotations, led by the on-duty soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, were engaged in the first major activity of every morning: saluting our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and sincerely wishing Chairman Mao a long life! Following this, the passengers in the train car, amidst the high-spirited singing of "The East is Red," began the struggle against selfishness and revisionism meeting.

At the meeting, everyone discussed the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and shared their experiences in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism.

A comrade from a match factory in Hebei Province, responsible for procurement, was the first to speak. He talked about how, during the process of great unity, there was a "self" that made him think: our organization has more people and greater strength, so small organizations should submit to large organizations. Because of this, the two factions in the factory could not unite. We brought these problems to repeated study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, overthrew the "self," overcame factionalism, established party spirit, and eliminated factionalism. Under the great call of Chairman Mao to achieve revolutionary great unity by industry and system, we achieved revolutionary great unity.

Amidst enthusiastic applause, a comrade with a Hunan accent spoke. He said: This time, the organization assigned me to work in the Northeast, and I couldn't understand it at first. I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and struggled against my selfish thoughts on the way. The brilliant "Three Articles" made me realize: having selfish thoughts means one cannot completely and thoroughly serve the people. I am determined to go to the new work post, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, do a good job in the revolution, and achieve new merits for the people.

An elderly woman with white hair listened to everyone's speeches and was very moved. She said: With you young people who listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we old folks can rest assured. Chairman Mao said to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. This "self" must be struggled against. If we do not struggle against the "self," we will not uproot the root of revisionism, and in the future, the country will change color, and our good days will be ruined. The elderly woman recalled the bitterness of the old society with pain. She spoke with tears, and everyone listened with tears. She finally said: Khrushchev in China is constantly fertilizing and watering the "self"! In the countryside, he promotes what he calls "three selfs and one package"! These three "selfs" and one "package" add up to one "self." This guy wants to corrupt the hearts of poor and lower-middle peasants with "self," which is poison coated with sugar, sweet to the mouth but deadly to the heart. He wants us to go back, but we will never agree! Not in a thousand ways, not in a million ways! The elderly woman became more and more indignant, and her revolutionary passion resonated with the passengers in the train car. Shouts of "Down with Khrushchev in China" echoed again and again. The elderly woman continued: "Struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" is the battle call from our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts. We must carry it out a million times. Struggle against the "self," uproot the root of revisionism, and let our country remain unchanged for thousands of years.

    列车上的斗私批修讲用会
    武阳
    列车上的斗私批修讲用会，发生在由北京开往吉林的七十一次旅客列车上。列车上的旅客，来自天南地北，有男有女，有老有少，各行各业。他们来到一起，就成了一个战斗单位，最坚决、最认真地执行毛主席要斗私，批修的最新指示，把车厢变成了斗私批修的战场。从这里可以清楚地看到：我国人民经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，思想革命化达到了新的境界。大家正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。　——编者
    由世界革命中心北京驶往北国江城——吉林的七十一次旅客列车，迎着灿烂的朝霞向前飞奔。
    车厢里的旅客们，手持红彤彤的宝书《毛主席语录》，在执勤解放军战士的带领下，正在进行着每天清晨的第一件大事：向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席敬礼，衷心地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！随后，车厢里的旅客在一片高昂的《东方红》歌声中，开始了“斗私，批修”讲用会。
    讲用会上，大家畅谈了一年来无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，交流了自己执行毛主席要斗私，批修最新指示的体会。
    河北省一个火柴厂担任采购的同志第一个发言。他谈到在大联合中，因为有个“私”字，就这样想：我们组织人数多，力量大，小组织要服从大组织。正因为这样，厂里的两派组织一直联合不起来。我们带着这些问题反复学习了毛主席要斗私，批修的最新指示，斗倒了“私”字，克服了派性，树立了党性，铲除了山头主义，在毛主席按行业按系统实现革命大联合的伟大号召下，实现了革命的大联合。
    在一片热烈的掌声中，一位操着湖南口音的同志发言。他说：这次组织上调我到东北工作，自己一时想不通。我反复学习毛主席著作，一路上斗了私心。光辉的“老三篇”使我认识到：有私心就不能完全彻底为人民服务。我决心到新的工作岗位上，努力学习毛主席著作，搞好革命工作，为人民立新功。
    一位头发斑白的老大娘听了大家的发言非常激动，她说：有了你们这些听毛主席的话，照毛主席指示办事的人，我们这老一辈就一百个放心了。毛主席说要斗私，批修。这个“私”不斗不行。不斗掉“私”字，就绝不了“修”字的根，将来国家就会改变颜色，我们的好日子就会被糟踏。这位老大娘沉痛地回忆了旧社会的苦。她含着眼泪讲，大家含着眼泪听。她最后说：中国赫鲁晓夫一个劲的往“私”字上施肥浇水，在农村搞什么“三自一包”！这三个“自”字，一个“包”字，总起来是一个“私”字。这个家伙妄想用“私”字来腐蚀我们贫下中农的心，这是毒药蘸糖，甜嘴断肠。他想让我们走回头路，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！大娘越说越气愤，革命的缴情引起了车厢旅客的共鸣。打倒中国赫鲁晓夫的口号声，一遍又一遍地高呼起来。大娘接着说：“斗私，批修”是咱们心中的红太阳毛主席发出的战斗号召，我们要一万个照办，斗掉“私”字，拔掉“修”根，让我们国家千秋万代永不变色。
