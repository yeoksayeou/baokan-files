We must stand firm against the Chinese Khrushchev. We, the poor peasants of the Ma Gong Zui Production Brigade in Tianhua Commune, Changsha County, Hunan Province, are determined to do so.

The Chinese Khrushchev is a venomous snake, and all that comes from his mouth is poison. In April 1961, when he came to our Tianhua Commune for a "work visit," he spewed out a lot of venom. To restore capitalism in the countryside, he proposed a series of "three freedoms and one contract" black goods, including "production responsibility system," "segmented contracting," "household management of forests," "expanding private plots," "decentralizing collective sideline production to households," "abolishing basic rations," and "opening free markets." To promote these black goods, he sent a work team to our brigade for a trial.

As soon as the work team arrived, they faithfully followed the "instructions" of the Chinese Khrushchev, boasting that if we followed their methods, we would reap endless benefits, mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members, and have "oil" and "prospects." We were so angry that we could hardly breathe. They wanted to destroy our collective economy, decentralize agricultural and sideline production to households, and force us back to the old path of individual farming before liberation. With a belly full of anger, we kept silent at their community meeting. They knew the atmosphere was wrong and hastily adjourned the meeting. As soon as they left, we started our own meeting. Everyone said: What they are doing this time is completely opposite to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao called on us to organize and take the path of collectivization, but they want to destroy the collective economy. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of agriculture and handicrafts from individual ownership to socialist collective ownership, and the transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce to socialist ownership, will undoubtedly greatly liberate the productive forces. This will create social conditions for greatly developing industrial and agricultural production." But they said that individual farming has "enthusiasm," "oil," and "prospects." What kind of nonsense is this? Everyone was more and more indignant. The visitors did not come with good intentions; they were like a weasel visiting the chicken coop, with no good intentions!

In the subsequent meetings held by the work team, we questioned them: "Does the Communist Party still exist?" They said, "It should exist." We said, "As long as the Communist Party exists for one day, we will practice collectivization for one day! After liberation, the people of Tianhua have built water conservancy projects, improved soil, expanded cultivated land, and turned barren mountains into granaries. Which of these was not achieved through the power of the collective economy? Why don't you let us take the path of collectivization? If you talk about 'mobilizing enthusiasm,' we first ask: What kind of enthusiasm are you mobilizing? Is it socialist enthusiasm or capitalist 'enthusiasm'? We have no capitalist 'enthusiasm,' no matter how you 'mobilize' it, it's in vain! We are full of socialist enthusiasm! For more than ten years, we have walked this path. Why can't you see it? If you say that individual farming has 'endless benefits' and 'prospects,' our ancestors have all been individual farmers. How many years have we 'rushed' in individual farming, but what we rushed into was still the miserable life of 'three years of abundance, nine years of poverty'; if you say that 'contracting production to households' has 'oil,' it is just to let everyone skim the oil from the collective. The collective is in the middle, and individuals are on the sides. Everyone is attacking the collective, like peeling a radish, one knife here, one knife there, and destroying the collective economy. Why, when our collective economy ship is in the middle of the river, do you call everyone to dismantle the planks?"

In this way, everyone spoke up, and the work team sent by the Chinese Khrushchev was left speechless. With no other choice, they brought out their black backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, saying that this was the instruction of ×× (referring to the Chinese Khrushchev), and not implementing it would be "anti-party." We said, we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, regardless of who you are! Regardless of how high your rank is! We have Chairman Mao backing us, so what are we afraid of! They said again that the commune members of Ma Gong Zui specialize in attacking cadres. We said, if you don't act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will besiege and attack you, surround you completely, and attack you until you are defeated!

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought makes us dare to resist the black wind and countercurrent. Although the Chinese Khrushchev ordered the implementation of "three freedoms and one contract," forcing the dissolution of collective sideline production and expanding private plots, we have only Chairman Mao in our hearts, and we are determined to take the path of socialist collectivization as taught by Chairman Mao. The more they force us to implement their methods, the more the poor and lower-middle peasants yearn for the collective. They sent people to participate in our meetings, and we moved the meetings to the fields. They forced us to implement the disguised individual farming of "segmented contracting," and when they sent people to inspect the fields, we worked separately for a while. As soon as they left, we gathered together to work. They wanted to expand private plots, but we did not increase even a fraction of an inch, and instead managed the collective fields even better. They ordered the dissolution of the commune's bamboo mat factory, but our brigade restored the dissolved bamboo mat factory a few days later and has continued to this day. The Chinese Khrushchev had no way to deal with us and said, "It seems that some cadres in Tianhua are not only unwilling to cooperate with us but are also standing firm against us." We want to warn the Chinese Khrushchev: You are right, that's exactly it. We will stand firm against you! Whatever you advocate, we will oppose; whatever you oppose, we will support. It's all about standing firm against you! This is not because of anything else, but because you represent the landlords and the bourgeoisie and want to restore capitalism. We are poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, determined to build socialism under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The two classes, two roads, and two lines are fundamentally opposed, like water and fire, how can we not stand firm against each other?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The Chinese Khrushchev opposes us taking the socialist path, so we must firmly take the socialist path; the Chinese Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism, so we must firmly pull him down, criticize him thoroughly, and completely eliminate all capitalist filth.

    我们硬是要和中国赫鲁晓夫针锋相对
    湖南长沙县天华大队马公嘴生产队老贫农　常义全　彭昆晃
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一条大毒蛇，从他嘴里流出来的尽是毒。一九六一年四月，他到我们天华大队“蹲点”时，就放了不少毒。他为了在农村复辟资本主义，抛出了“产量责任制”、“分段包干”、山林“分户管理”、“扩大自留地”、集体副业“下放到户”、“取消基本口粮”、开放“自由市场”等一大串“三自一包”的黑货。为了推销这些黑货，他派工作队到我们生产队试点。
    工作队一进我们队，就忠实地按照中国赫鲁晓夫的“指示”办事，并吹嘘只要按照他们这一套去做，就会“好处无穷”，就可以“调动社员的积极性”，使大家“有油水”，“有奔头”。我们一听，肺都气炸了。他们要搞垮我们的集体经济，把农副业生产下放到户，这不是要拆我们人民公社的台、逼我们走解放前单干的老路是什么？我们按着一肚子火，在他们主持的社员会上一言不发，他们自知气氛不对，就草草散会。他们会一散，我们就开起会来。大家都说：这次他们来搞的名堂，怎么尽是和毛主席的号召相反的。毛主席号召我们组织起来，走集体化的道路，可他们却要搞垮集体经济。毛主席说：“农业和手工业由个体所有制变为社会主义的集体所有制，私营工商业由资本主义所有制变为社会主义所有制，必然使生产力大大地获得解放。这样就为大大地发展工业和农业的生产创造了社会条件”。他们却说单干“有积极性”，“有油水”，“有奔头”，这是什么鬼名堂？大家越议论越气愤。来者不善，他们是黄鼠狼给鸡拜年来了，没安好心肠！
    在以后工作队召开的会上，我们就责问他们：“共产党还存在不？”他们说：“要存在。”我们就说：“只要共产党存在一天，我们就要搞一天集体化！解放后，我们天华人民兴修水利，改良土壤，扩大耕地面积，穷山窝变成米粮仓，哪一件不是依靠了集体经济的力量？你们为什么不让我们走集体化道路？要说‘调动积极性’，我们首先要问是调动什么积极性？是社会主义积极性，还是资本主义‘积极性’？资本主义‘积极性’，我们一点没有，随你怎么‘调动’也是白费劲！社会主义积极性，我们浑身都是！十多年来，我们就是这么走过来的，为什么你们看不见？要说单干‘好处无穷’，有‘奔头’，我们祖祖辈辈都是单干的，单干‘奔’了多少年，但奔来的还不是‘三年提烂九只篮’的穷苦生活；要说‘包产到户’‘有油水’，还不是叫大家都揩集体的油。中间集体，四周个人，大家围着集体打，好比削萝卜那样，你一刀，他一刀，把集体经济搞垮。为什么当我们集体经济的船走到河中间时，你们叫大家拆船板？！”
    这样，大家你一言，我一语，把中国赫鲁晓夫派来的工作组问得哑口无言。没办法了，他们抬出了他们的黑后台中国赫鲁晓夫，说什么这是××（指中国赫鲁晓夫）的指示，不贯彻就是“反党”。我们说，我们按照毛主席的指示办，管你什么人！管你官有多大！我们有毛主席撑腰，怕你什么！他们又说，马公嘴的社员专门会围攻干部。我们说，你不按照毛主席指示办事，我们就是要围，就是要攻，把你们团团围住，把你们攻得落花流水！就这样，他们抵挡不住，逃走了。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想使我们敢于顶黑风，抗逆流。尽管中国赫鲁晓夫下令实行“三自一包”，强迫解散集体副业，扩大自留地，但是我们心里只有毛主席，只有毛主席教导的坚决走社会主义集体化道路。他们越是强迫我们实行他们那一套，我们贫农、下中农越是向往着集体。他们派人参加我们的会，我们就把会议搬到地头去开。他们强迫我们实行变相单干的“分段包干”，并派人到地头检查时，我们就分开干一段，他们人一走，我们又围拢到一起干活。他们要扩大自留地，我们硬是一分一厘不增加，反把集体的田经营得更好。他们下命令解散了大队篾席厂，我们队过不几天又把被解散的蔑席厂恢复起来，一直坚持到现在。中国赫鲁晓夫拿我们没有办法，就说：“看来，天华的一部分干部不仅是不同我们合作，而且是针锋相对。”我们要正告中国赫鲁晓夫：你说对了，就是这样，我们就是要同你针锋相对！你提倡什么，我们就反对什么；你反对什么，我们就拥护什么，反正是针锋相对！这不是因为别的，而是因为你代表地主、资产阶级，要搞资本主义。我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的贫农、下中农，要在毛主席领导下坚决干社会主义。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线，根本对立，水火不容，怎能不针锋相对？！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫反对我们走社会主义道路，我们就越要坚定不移地走社会主义道路；中国赫鲁晓夫要搞资本主义复辟，我们就要坚决把他拉下马，把他批倒批臭，彻底清除一切资本主义的污泥浊水。
