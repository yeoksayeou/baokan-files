Title: The Philosophy of Fleas

Three decades ago, Mr. Lu Xun wrote an article titled "Famous People and Famous Sayings." The literary patriarch of Soviet revisionism, Sholokhov, is a renowned "famous person" in today's world. This "famous person" is not just famous in name; he has written many "masterpieces" and uttered numerous "famous sayings."

"Without any reason, not only will there be no rebellion, but even fleas won't bite people." This is one of Sholokhov's "famous sayings." He said this in a letter to Gorky in June 1931, meaning: if it were not for the "mistakes" of the Soviet government, counter-revolutionaries would never launch rebellions.

What nonsense!

There are no fleas that do not bite people. With a reason, they bite people; without a reason, they still bite people. In short, fleas live by biting people; if they do not bite people, they cease to be fleas. Over 1,700 years ago, a Chinese writer wrote in an essay: "Those who catch fleas, without exception, grind them between their teeth, for they harm the body." Ancient people would crush caught fleas between their teeth because they hated these pests for biting and harming people.

"To create disorder, to fail, to create more disorder, to fail again, until annihilation—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." All reactionaries are "fleas" of humanity; they make a living by biting people and are prone to causing trouble.

The major counter-revolutionary Grigory in "And Quiet Flows the Don," and the White Guard officers and reactionary kulaks in "Virgin Soil Upturned," are all such "fleas." These "fleas," after the great victory of the October Revolution, unwilling to accept their defeat, constantly and in every way possible, try to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to make a comeback and restore capitalism. They launch counter-revolutionary rebellions not because the Soviet government made any "mistakes," but because their reactionary class nature compels them. If one must find a "reason," this is the only "reason."

Yet, this "famous person" Sholokhov, in broad daylight, spouts such nonsense: "Without any reason, not only will there be no rebellion, but even fleas won't bite people," turning the tables and blaming the Soviet government for the occurrence of counter-revolutionary rebellions.

Fleas bite people because of human "mistakes"—this is Sholokhov's philosophy. This is a philosophy of "fleas" through and through!

Sholokhov himself is a counter-revolutionary "flea." He has always stood on the side of the "fleas," using all his "wisdom, passion, and soul" to attack and defame the proletarian revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the Soviet people, and to glorify and praise counter-revolutionaries, reactionary kulaks, traitors, and all kinds of "fleas."

Birds of a feather flock together. Sholokhov's "dear Nikita Sergeyevich" had the audacity in 1963 to crown him as a "true Bolshevik writer." A "flea" wearing a laurel wreath, neither donkey nor horse, neither this nor that, is truly laughable and amusing!

Such a "true Bolshevik writer" reminds us of what Engels said about those impostors who infiltrated the Communist Party: "Marx probably would send these gentlemen the words Heine said about his imitators: 'I sowed dragon's teeth, but reaped fleas.'"

    跳蚤的哲学
    辛午
    三十二年前，鲁迅先生写过一篇文章，题目是：《名人和名言》。苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫，在当今的世界上，算得是一个赫赫有名的大“名人”；这位“名人”，“名”不虚传，不仅写了许多“名著”，而且说了不少“名言”。
    “无缘无故，不仅不会叛乱，连跳蚤也不会咬人。”——这就是肖洛霍夫的一句“名言”。这句“名言”，是他在一九三一年六月给高尔基的信中说的，意思是：如果不是由于苏维埃政权的“错误”，反革命分子是决不会发动叛乱的。
    这真是奇谈怪论！
    世上没有不“咬人”的跳蚤。有缘有故，它要“咬人”；“无缘无故”，它也要“咬人”。总之，跳蚤是以“咬人”为生的，不“咬人”就不成其为跳蚤。一千七百多年前，中国有一个文学家在一篇文章中这样写道：“得蚤者，莫不糜之齿牙，为害身也。”古代的人们，所以要把捉得的跳蚤放在自己的牙齿间嚼得粉碎，就是因为痛恨这个坏东西“咬人”、“害身”也。
    “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”一切反动派，都是人类的“跳蚤”，他们以“咬人”为业，捣乱成性。
    《静静的顿河》中的大反革命分子葛利高里，就是这样的“跳蚤”；《被开垦的处女地》中的白匪军官和反动富农，也是这样的“跳蚤”。这些“跳蚤”，在伟大的十月革命胜利以后，不甘心于他们的失败，时时刻刻，千方百计，要推翻无产阶级专政，妄图卷土重来，东山再起，复辟资本主义。他们发动反革命叛乱，决不是因为苏维埃政权有什么“错误”，而是由他们的反动的阶级本性所决定的。如果要找什么“缘故”的话，这就是唯一的“缘故”。
    可是，这位“名人”肖洛霍夫却白天说黑话，胡说什么“无缘无故，不仅不会叛乱，连跳蚤也不会咬人”，倒打一耙，把发生反革命叛乱的责任推到苏维埃政权的头上。
    跳蚤“咬人”，是由于人的“错误”——这就是肖洛霍夫的哲学。这是地地道道的“跳蚤”哲学！
    肖洛霍夫自己就是一个反革命“跳蚤”。他一贯站在“跳蚤”的立场上，用自己“全部的智慧、全部的热情、全部的心灵”，恣意攻击和丑化无产阶级革命、无产阶级专政和苏联人民，竭力美化和歌颂反革命分子、反动富农、叛徒等各种各样的“跳蚤”。
    惺惺惜惺惺。肖洛霍夫的那位“亲爱的尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇”，在一九六三年竟然厚着脸皮把他捧为“真正的布尔什维克作家”。“跳蚤”头上戴上了一顶桂冠，非驴非马，不伦不类，真是令人忍俊不禁，哑然失笑！
    这样的“真正的布尔什维克作家”，使我们想起了恩格斯对那些混入共产党内的冒牌的马克思主义者所说的一段话：“马克思大概会把海涅对自己的模仿者说的话转送给这些先生们：‘我播下的是龙种，而收获的却是跳蚤’。”
