The great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has guided Tianjin's proletarian cultural revolution to a great situation. Revolutionary great unity is increasingly developing and consolidating, revolutionary three-in-one combination is being rapidly realized, revolutionary great criticism is gradually deepening, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes are widely held, production and work present a new situation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 10th: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Tianjin is excellent. Revolutionary great unity is increasingly developing and consolidating, revolutionary three-in-one combination is being rapidly realized, revolutionary great criticism is gradually deepening, and in the midst of widely holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes and launching a new high tide of "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism," Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized to an unprecedented extent. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people are advancing along the victorious course opened by the great helmsman Chairman Mao.

After Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China reached Tianjin, revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the entire city have seen a new high tide. The revolutionary torrent surges forward, unstoppable. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers in the city's grassroots units have, in a very short time before National Day, basically realized revolutionary great unity. The appearance of a vast revolutionary army united by Mao Zedong Thought with the proletariat as the main body has rapidly developed the revolutionary situation in Tianjin. In late October, after Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the great call to realize revolutionary great unity according to systems, the proletarian revolutionaries in Tianjin have, with the fastest steps, studied and implemented this call. As of now, 70% of the factories in the entire city have realized revolutionary great unity according to systems, further consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity politically, ideologically, and organizationally.

Revolutionary great unity has promoted the deepening of revolutionary great criticism and the in-depth development of struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit. In the revolutionary great criticism, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in Tianjin have taken up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought in factories, schools, institutions, suburban villages, and neighborhoods, launching a fierce total attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin. Many units have everyone speaking and writing, treating revolutionary great criticism as a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Through recalling the history of the factory (village), family history, and personal blood-stained history in the old society, the broad masses of workers and peasants have, with ironclad facts, fiercely criticized the reactionary fallacies such as "exploitation is meritorious" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his 1949 "Tianjin Speech," which suppressed the working class, praised the bourgeoisie, and aimed to restore capitalism. In the high tide of revolutionary great criticism, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, through presenting facts, listing crimes, making comparisons, digging out roots, discussing lessons, not only exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist nature of the Chinese Khrushchev, further eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism, but also promoted their own ideological revolutionization, creating favorable conditions for struggle-criticism-transformation in their units.

After Chairman Mao issued the great battle call to "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism," the entire city, with the working class as the vanguard and "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, rapidly and widely established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Now, the entire city has established more than 4,700 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with 276,000 people participating in the study. Many study classes also adopt the form of lectures and usage meetings, gradually deepening the "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism." These lectures and usage meetings are combined with the specific situation of the unit and one's own ideological reality, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems and ideological problems, with good effects and great gains. The broad revolutionary masses generally reflect that through study, they love the great leader Chairman Mao even more, believe in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought even more, and are even more loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Under the drive of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new levels has emerged in the entire city.

On the basis of revolutionary great unity, Tianjin is seeing a new high tide of revolutionary three-in-one combination. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in struggle-criticism-transformation in one's own unit. One must solve this problem well." Many revolutionary leading cadres, together with the responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations, study Chairman Mao's works, "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism," actively listen to the masses' criticisms, examine themselves, and touch their souls deeply. Revolutionary mass organizations also enthusiastically help cadres who have made mistakes return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, boldly liberate cadres, use cadres, and combine with cadres, letting revolutionary leading cadres take on heavy responsibilities, achieve new merits, and play a core and backbone role in revolution and production. In this great situation, more and more grassroots units have realized revolutionary "three-in-one combination," established temporary power organs, and production and work have presented a new situation.

    毛泽东思想大普及　革命洪流不可挡
    天津文化大革命形势越来越好
    全市组成以工人阶级为主体的浩浩荡荡的革命大军，革命大联合日益发展巩固，革命三结合逐步实现，革命大批判步步深入，毛泽东思想学习班广泛举办，生产和工作一片新气象
    据新华社天津十日电　在伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线指引下，天津市无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。革命的大联合日益发展巩固，革命的三结合正在迅速实现，革命的大批判逐步深入，在大办毛泽东思想学习班、掀起“斗私，批修”新高潮中，毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，正在沿着伟大舵手毛主席开辟的胜利航道阔步前进。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列极为重要的最新指示传到天津以后，全市的革命大联合、革命的三结合出现了新的高潮。革命洪流滚滚向前，势不可挡。在毛泽东思想的指引下，全市基层单位的革命职工，在国庆节前的很短时间里，就基本上实现了革命大联合。用毛泽东思想统一起来的以工人阶级为主体的浩浩荡荡的革命大军的出现，使天津市的革命形势迅速发展。十月下旬，毛主席、党中央发出按照系统实现革命大联合的伟大号召以后，天津市无产阶级革命派，又以最迅速的步伐学习和贯彻这一号召。截至目前为止，全市百分之七十的工厂已经按系统实现了革命大联合，使革命的大联合从政治上、思想上、组织上进一步得到了巩固和发展。
    革命大联合促进了革命大批判和本单位斗批改的深入开展。在革命大批判中，天津市的广大无产阶级革命派，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，在工厂、学校、机关、郊区农村、街道，向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在天津的代理人展开了猛烈的总攻击。许多单位人人动口、个个动笔，把革命大批判当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。广大工农群众通过忆厂（村）史、家史和个人在旧社会的血泪史，用铁的事实狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”等反动谬论和他的一九四九年“天津讲话”这个镇压工人阶级、吹捧资产阶级、复辟资本主义的黑纲领。在革命大批判高潮中，广大无产阶级革命派通过摆事实，列罪状，搞对比，挖根源，谈教训，不仅揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的本质，进一步肃清了反革命修正主义的流毒，也促进了自己的思想革命化，为本单位斗批改创造了有利条件。
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号召以后，全市以工人阶级为先导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，迅速地、广泛地办起毛泽东思想学习班。现在，全市已经办起四千七百多个毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的有二十七万六千多人。很多学习班还采用开讲用会的形式，把“斗私，批修”一步步引向深入。这些讲用会同本单位的具体情况相结合，同自己的思想实际相结合，用毛泽东思想来解决实际问题、思想问题，效果很好，收获很大。广大革命群众普遍反映，通过学习，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加信仰战无不胜的毛泽东思想，更加忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在毛泽东思想学习班的带动下，现在全市已经出现了一个学出新水平、用出新水平的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮。
    在革命大联合的基础上，天津市正在出现革命三结合的新高潮。毛主席教导我们说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”很多革命的领导干部同革命群众组织负责人一起学习毛主席著作，“斗私，批修”，主动听取群众批评，检查自己，狠触灵魂。革命群众组织也热情地帮助犯错误的干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来，大胆地解放干部，使用干部，结合干部，让革命的领导干部挑重担，立新功，在革命和生产中发挥核心和骨干作用。在这一片大好形势下，越来越多的基层单位实现了革命的“三结合”，建立了临时权力机构，生产和工作出现了一片新气象。
