The brave military and civilians of Hanoi shot down an invading U.S. aggressor aircraft on the night of October 30. Shortly after, they shot down another U.S. aircraft in the early hours of October 31. Whether the U.S. air aggressors come by day or by night, they cannot escape the severe punishment of the highly vigilant military and civilians of North Vietnam.

It is reported from here that the military and civilians of Quang Ninh and Nghe An provinces shot down one U.S. aircraft each on October 30 and 31. The military and civilians of Quang Binh province shot down three U.S. aircraft on October 23, 25, and 30.

It is reported from here that the military and civilians of the Vinh Linh area of North Vietnam shot down an invading U.S. B-52 bomber on October 29.

That morning, a group of U.S. B-52 bombers invaded the skies over the Vinh Linh area. The highly vigilant military and civilians of Vinh Linh immediately launched a fierce counterattack, hitting one of the aircraft. This U.S. aircraft then crashed in the southern part of the demilitarized zone. This is the third U.S. B-52 bomber shot down by the military and civilians of North Vietnam.
