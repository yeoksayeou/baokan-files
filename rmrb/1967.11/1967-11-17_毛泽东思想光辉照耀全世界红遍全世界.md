Japanese artists from the Kokuritsuza Theater troupe visited the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao, Shaoshan, and enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought, wishing the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, eternal life. The Japanese artists spent a happy day in Shaoshan with boundless reverence.

Hearing that they would visit the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao today, the Japanese friends were overjoyed. Along the way, they loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations and sang "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" repeatedly. They also enthusiastically taught the accompanying personnel to sing the Hunan folk song "Liuyang River" that praises our great leader Chairman Mao. The passionate songs flew all the way to Shaoshan.

The mountains surrounding Shaoshan were bustling with drums and songs, creating a festive atmosphere. As soon as the Japanese friends arrived in Shaoshan, without resting, they immediately visited Chairman Mao's former residence. The Japanese artists were deeply moved, unable to contain their excitement, with some tears welling up, repeatedly shouting with the welcoming crowd: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

At Chairman Mao's former residence, actress Fumiko Bunko said excitedly, "In this remote village, the great leader Chairman Mao was born, and he liberated all the people of China. His splendor shines across the world and spreads across the world!" The troupe leader Fujikawa Natsuko said passionately, "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Shaoshan is where the red sun rises, and the red sun warms us. We will bring this warmth back to Japan, arm the Japanese people with Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely fight against the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, and modern revisionism. We will definitely apply what we have learned in Shaoshan and other places in China to the actual struggle in Japan and strive for greater victories!" Deputy leader Hattori Seikiku said, "Coming to Shaoshan makes us love Chairman Mao even more, respect Chairman Mao even more, and understand more deeply that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. After returning to our country, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and dedicate ourselves to the revolutionary cause in Japan."

At noon on October 23rd, our great leader Chairman Mao received the entire Kokuritsuza Theater troupe in Beijing. To commemorate this unforgettable moment, the Japanese revolutionary artists performed a song and dance show during their visit to China, depicting the scene of meeting Chairman Mao and their excited feelings. Today, they performed this show with great excitement for the people of Chairman Mao's hometown, and were warmly welcomed by the people of Shaoshan. After visiting Shaoshan, all members of the Kokuritsuza Theater troupe left a message in the guest book: "The birth of Chairman Mao is a great event for the Chinese people and all the people of the world. Chairman Mao is our best example and the red sun in the hearts of the world's people. This sun not only shines brightly in the sky but also warms our specific work with its warmth and becomes our model. We are fortunate to have such a great leader. We wish our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!"

The Kokuritsuza Theater troupe arrived in Changsha for a visit on the 14th.
