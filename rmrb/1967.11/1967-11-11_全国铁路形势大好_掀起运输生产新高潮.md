The national railway situation is excellent and a new high tide of transportation production is sweeping across the country. The national railway transportation work conference calls on all railway workers to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, to do a good job in revolutionary criticism and reform within the unit, and to strive to complete this year's transportation production tasks, welcoming the upcoming new leap in industrial and agricultural production.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other central leaders received all the representatives and gave important instructions.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the recent national railway transportation work conference held in Beijing called on all railway workers to ride the great momentum of the Cultural Revolution, to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination across the entire railway system, to do a good job in revolutionary criticism and reform within the unit, and to carry the Cultural Revolution in the railway system to the end. At the same time, it called on all railway workers to put revolution in command of production, to quickly launch a new high tide of railway transportation production, and to welcome the upcoming new leap in industrial and agricultural production.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other central leaders received all the representatives attending the conference during the meeting and gave important instructions.

This was a conference that held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and actively learned and applied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. It was also a conference that combined revolution with production. During the conference, representatives from all railway bureaus across the country seriously studied the extremely important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, and received great education and inspiration.

When the representatives reviewed the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the national railway system over the past more than a year, they pointed out that under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the national railway departments have undergone earth-shaking changes in the Cultural Revolution. The current situation across the railway system is excellent. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres have truly been mobilized. The agents of Khrushchev in China in the railway department have been exposed, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist goods they promoted in the railway department have been bankrupt. Among the railway workers, an unprecedented mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has formed. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres in the railway system have, with a combative attitude, completed the heavy transportation tasks in the Cultural Revolution. They have done their best to load one more car and run one more train, making the railway workers' team and organizational command work undergo a severe test and accumulate extremely valuable experience.

The conference focused on discussing the issue of promoting revolutionary great unity across the railway system. Everyone agreed that to achieve revolutionary great unity, we must first firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in our minds, fiercely fight against the "self" in our heads, establish the "public," thoroughly expose the petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes advocated by Comrade Lin Biao are good classrooms for fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations across the railway system should hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes in batches, taking "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to strengthen ideological education for all cadres and workers across the railway system, and to strive to promote, consolidate, and develop revolutionary great unity across the railway system.

During the conference, the Harbin Railway Bureau, Shanghai Railway Bureau, and Beijing Railway Bureau Guang'anmen Station introduced their experiences in achieving revolutionary great unity and putting Mao Zedong Thought in command of transportation production, which greatly inspired and educated the attending representatives.

The representatives seriously studied the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit. This must be solved." The representatives believed that the practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past more than a year has proven that the cadres in the national railway departments are mostly good or relatively good. The conference pointed out that the revolutionary mass organizations in each railway department must implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, release a batch of cadres, let them take on heavy responsibilities, and test them in class struggle and production struggle. Cadres who have made mistakes, including those who have made serious mistakes, must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, deeply examine their mistakes, draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and make new contributions to the people in the struggle.

The conference pointed out that since liberation, the national railway departments have been under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, promoting a set of revisionist goods. These revisionist goods have deep roots and great harm. The broad masses of revolutionary workers and cadres in the railway system must combine the great criticism movement against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the railway departments, thoroughly eliminate the poison and influence of these revisionist goods in all aspects, and at the same time carry out profound reforms in all aspects, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions in the people's railway.

The conference required all revolutionary railway workers to further firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasping revolution and promoting production," to quickly launch a new high tide of transportation production, and to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's transportation production tasks.

This conference was held from October 11th to 27th.

    全国铁路形势大好　掀起运输生产新高潮
    全国铁路运输工作会议号召全路职工以斗私批修为纲，尽快实现革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位斗批改，力争完成今年运输生产任务，迎接即将到来的工农业生产新跃进。
    周恩来总理和中央其他领导同志接见了全体代表并作了重要指示
    据新华社十日讯　最近在北京举行的全国铁路运输工作会议，号召全国铁路职工乘无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，以“斗私，批修”为纲，尽快地在全路实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，把铁路系统的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。同时号召全国铁路职工以革命统帅生产，迅速掀起铁路运输生产的新高潮，迎接即将来到的工农业生产新跃进。
    周恩来总理和中央其他领导同志在会议期间接见了出席会议的全体代表，并作了重要指示。
    这是一次高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的讲用会，也是一次抓革命促生产的会议。会议期间，来自全国各铁路局的代表，认真学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的极为重要的指示，受到了极大的教育和鼓舞。
    代表们在回顾全国铁路系统一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的情况时指出，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，全国铁路部门在文化大革命中，发生了翻天覆地的变化。目前全路形势一片大好。广大革命职工、革命干部真正发动起来了。中国赫鲁晓夫在铁路部门的代理人已经被揪了出来，他们在铁路部门推行的一套反革命修正主义货色已经破产。在铁路职工中，一个前所未有的群众性活学活用毛主席著作的热潮已经形成。全路广大革命职工、革命干部在文化大革命中，以战斗的姿态，完成了繁重的运输任务，他们千方百计地为多装一车货，多开一列车而进行顽强的劳动，使铁路职工队伍和组织指挥工作，都经受了一次严峻的考验，积累了极其宝贵的经验。
    会议着重讨论了促进全路革命大联合的问题。大家认为，要实现革命的大联合，首先必须在思想上大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底搞臭小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。林彪同志号召的举办毛泽东思想学习班，是斗私批修的好课堂。全路各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织，都要分期分批开办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，加强对全路广大干部和职工的思想教育，努力促进、巩固和发展全路的革命大联合。
    会上，哈尔滨铁路局、上海铁路局和北京铁路局广安门车站等单位，介绍了他们实现革命大联合和以毛泽东思想统帅运输生产的经验，使到会代表受到很大启发和教育。
    代表们认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”代表们认为，一年多来无产阶级文化大革命运动的实践证明，全国铁路部门的干部，绝大多数是好的和比较好的。会议指出，各铁路部门的革命群众组织一定要贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，解放一批干部，让他们挑重担，在阶级斗争和生产斗争中经受考验。犯有错误包括那些犯有严重错误的干部，要以“斗私，批修”为纲，深刻地检查自己的错误，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界线，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，在斗争中为人民立新功。
    会议指出，解放以来，全国铁路部门在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，推行了一套修正主义的货色。这些修正主义货色流毒很深，危害很大。全路广大革命职工和革命干部，必须把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，同铁路部门的斗批改结合起来，彻底肃清这些修正主义货色在各方面的流毒和影响，同时在各方面进行深刻的改革，让毛泽东思想占领人民铁路的一切阵地。
    会议要求全国铁路革命职工进一步坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，迅速掀起一个运输生产的新高潮。争取完成和超额完成今年的运输生产任务。
    这次会议是在十月十一日到二十七日举行的。
