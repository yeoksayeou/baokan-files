Pakistani communities hold grand gatherings to celebrate the official release of two versions of Chairman Mao's works

New China News Agency, Rawalpindi, November 11th: Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" — "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" — have been translated into Bengali and recently published as a standalone edition in Dacca, the capital of East Pakistan.

The publisher printed three quotations from Chairman Mao on the first page of the standalone edition regarding the mass line.

The translator wrote in the preface that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of great China but also the leader of all oppressed peoples around the world who are fighting for liberation. For those around the world who are fighting against imperialism, feudalism, and other reactionary forces, these three brilliant works will be a great guide.

The translation and publication of Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" in local Pakistani languages have been warmly welcomed by readers. The Karachi Publishing House published a Sindhi translation for readers in the southern Sindh region of West Pakistan earlier this month. In early this year, the "Three Articles" were published in Urdu in Karachi and Lahore. These three articles have also been published in several local newspapers and magazines. People are very fond of reading Chairman Mao's "Three Articles." One reader said, "In these three articles, Chairman Mao Zedong explains the greatest teachings to the revolutionary people in the most simple and understandable language."

New China News Agency, Rawalpindi: On the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution — November 7th — more than 200 people from various sectors in Pakistan held a gathering in Karachi to celebrate the official release of the Urdu and Sindhi versions of some of Chairman Mao's brilliant works. The gathering was organized by the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in Karachi.

Chairman Mao's works in Urdu have 13 standalone editions, including: "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Book Worship," "Oppose Liberalism," "It Is Good, Not Bad, to Be Attacked by the Enemy," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Talk with the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily." Chairman Mao's works in Sindhi have three standalone editions: "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." These standalone editions were officially released by the Karachi Publishing House.

At the gathering, the manager of the Karachi Publishing House, Zainuddin Khan, gave a speech. He said, today, on the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution, celebrating the official release of the translations of Chairman Mao's works is of special significance. The October Revolution, led by the great Lenin, established the first proletarian dictatorship in human history. The great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong has carried on the great cause of Lenin and raised high the banner of the October Revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is a historic development of Marxism-Leninism and will forever illuminate the bright path for the revolutionary people of the world.

He said, Mao Zedong Thought is guiding the struggle for liberation of all oppressed nations in the world.

The Chinese Consul to Karachi, Shen Peiwen, also gave a speech at the gathering.

A female poet recited a poem titled "The Dawn of the East," celebrating the liberation of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. During the gathering, Pakistani friends enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!" After the gathering, many people crowded around the bookstand to purchase the translated editions of Chairman Mao's works.

    毛主席的“老三篇”译成巴基斯坦地方语言出版，受到了读者热烈的欢迎。卡拉奇人民出版社曾在本月初为西巴基斯坦南部信德地区的读者出版了信德文译本。今年年初在卡拉奇和拉合尔出版了“老三篇”乌尔都文译本。这三篇文章还刊登在几家地方报纸和杂志上。人们非常喜欢读毛主席的“老三篇”。一位读者说：“在这三篇文章里，毛泽东主席用最通俗易懂的语言向革命人民阐明了最伟大的教导。”
