The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Ganzhou region of Jiangxi Province is unprecedentedly good, better than ever before. After more than a year of struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the broad masses of the people have been fully mobilized and deeply educated. The great thought of Mao Zedong has been firmly established in the hearts of the people throughout the region.

In Jiangxi Province, the struggle between the two lines in the Ganzhou region has been the sharpest and most intense. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in this region have vigorously promoted the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, inciting two major factions among the people, deceiving a portion of the masses, and brutally suppressing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, in order to defend the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, have fought bravely. At that time, this region seemed chaotic. In fact, under the wise leadership of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, the result was: the enemies hiding within the proletarian dictatorship apparatus were disrupted, the broad revolutionary masses were tempered, the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie was thoroughly defeated, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved decisive victory.

Currently, in the entire Ganzhou region, 90% of the revolutionary masses have achieved revolutionary great unity by system. The revolutionary great criticism, closely linked with the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit, is vigorously unfolding. Most counties and some communes in the entire region have established new temporary leadership bodies. Industrial production has exceeded the state plan for two consecutive months, and some factories have created the highest production levels in history. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all seen new developments, and grain harvests have reached the largest in history.

A significant sign of the good situation in Ganzhou is that the people have been fully mobilized. The broad revolutionary masses, following the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," have actively taken action and thrown themselves into the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Over the past year, in factories, rural areas, offices, schools, and the military throughout the region, everyone is concerned with state affairs. In the past, when a family got together, they would chat and talk about family matters. Now, fathers, sons, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, relatives, from children of ten or so years old to elderly women with white hair, when they get together, they discuss the issues of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gradually understanding how to carry out the revolution and prevent capitalist restoration under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything. Many people have achieved the goal of "not leaving Chairman Mao's book, not leaving Chairman Mao's words, and not leaving Chairman Mao's teachings in action," doing everything according to Mao Zedong Thought. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the tempering of the Cultural Revolution, a large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are growing up vigorously.

Currently, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses in the Ganzhou region are riding the great momentum of the good situation, taking "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, deeply carrying out the revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of the region and the unit, and striving for a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    乱了阶级敌人  锻炼了革命群众
    赣州地区文化大革命形势比以往任何时候都好
    据新华社南昌电　江西省赣州地区无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，比以往任何时候都好。广大人民群众经过一年多两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的锻炼，得到了充分的发动，受到了深刻的教育。伟大的毛泽东思想已经在全区人民的心目中树立起绝对的权威。
    在江西省，赣州地区的两条路线斗争是最尖锐、最激烈的。这个地区的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，竭力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，曾经在人民群众中挑起对立的两大派，蒙蔽一部分群众，疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派。无产阶级革命派为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，进行了英勇斗争。那时候，这个地区好象乱了。其实，在最高统帅毛主席的英明领导下，结果是：乱了隐藏在无产阶级专政机构内部的敌人，锻炼了广大的革命群众，资产阶级反动路线彻底破产，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性胜利。
    目前，赣州全区百分之九十的革命群众已经按系统实现了革命的大联合。革命大批判紧密结合本单位的斗批改，正在蓬勃展开。全区绝大部分县和部分公社已经建立起新的临时领导机构。工业生产连续两个月超额完成国家计划，部分工厂创造了历史上最高生产水平。农、林、牧、副、渔都有新的发展，粮食获得了历史上最大的丰收。
    赣州地区形势大好的一个重要标志是人民群众充分发动起来了。广大革命群众遵循伟大领袖毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，积极行动起来，投入了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。一年多来，在全区的工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队，人人都在关心国家大事。过去一家人碰到一块，说闲话、拉家常。现在，父子、夫妻、兄弟、姐妹、亲友，从十几岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老太太，碰到一块就讨论无产阶级文化大革命的问题，逐渐懂得在无产阶级专政条件下怎样进行革命，怎样防止资本主义复辟的大道理。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上。许多人做到“身不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席的教导”，处处按照毛泽东思想办事。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，经过文化大革命运动的锻炼，一大批无产阶级革命事业的接班人正在茁壮成长。
    目前，赣州地区无产阶级革命派和革命群众，正乘着大好形势的浩荡东风，以“斗私，批修”为纲，深入开展革命的大批判和本地区、本单位的斗批改，夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利。
