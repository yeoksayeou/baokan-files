The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the Third Central Primary School in Shanghai's Zhabei District are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's policy of resuming classes and making revolution. They are using Chairman Mao's directives on the education revolution as their guiding principles, conducting teaching while simultaneously carrying out reforms. In their teaching practice, they have thoroughly criticized the revisionist education line represented by China's Khrushchev, and have established Chairman Mao's proletarian education line.

This school has been conducting classes and making revolution for over eight months. From the beginning, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have been studying how to effectively carry out the resumption of classes and make revolution. They have learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction must be accompanied by reason, and construction is within it." Chairman Mao's words have enlightened them: only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing the revisionist education line can they firmly establish the proletarian education line.

How to destroy? Following Chairman Mao's instructions on "shortening the school system, revolutionizing education, and ending the domination of our schools by bourgeois intellectuals," they have targeted the key issues of the revisionist education line and carried out criticism from the following five aspects:

1. They have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois educational ideology of "intellectual education first" and "only reading is noble," and have established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The ideology of "intellectual education first," "grades first," and "entrance exams first" was particularly prominent in this primary school in the past. The broad revolutionary teachers and students have conducted in-depth exposure and criticism of this. Chairman Mao said: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." However, the revisionist education line advocates "all other occupations are inferior, only reading is noble," "fame and fortune," and "personal struggle," which are decadent bourgeois ideas that poison the minds of primary school students, harm their health, and cultivate revisionist seedlings.

Through the criticism of intellectual education first, political and ideological education has been greatly strengthened, and a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been initiated. They have placed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything else, made the study of Chairman Mao's works the most important course, and combined the study of Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary criticism.

2. They have thoroughly criticized the revisionist fallacies such as "two ears deaf to outside affairs, one heart only reads the classics," and have established the proletarian educational ideology of cultivating successors to the proletarian revolution from the great storms of class struggle.

In the past, the students of this primary school lived a life revolving around books from morning "book sounds" to the end of school, from low-grade literacy education to high-grade entrance exam guidance. They became "hothouse flowers" that could not withstand the wind and rain. The old textbooks were filled with class reconciliation fallacies, and the lectures also obscured class struggle. For example, they explained "People's Republic of China" as "a country where the Chinese nation's workers, peasants, men, and women live harmoniously together," and explained "child bride" as "a bride raised from childhood in the family," and so on. Many revolutionary teachers and students angrily said during the criticism that the revisionist education line advocates class reconciliation tunes and cultivates bourgeois "flowers"!

They have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggles and grow in the tempering of the great storms of revolution." They have made class struggle a main course in the school. They have also adopted the methods of "inviting in" and "going out," inviting activists who study Chairman Mao's works and old workers with rich class struggle experience to give lectures in the school, and organizing students to visit factories, listen to workers tell the bloody history of class struggle. Now, a team of over thirty old workers regularly takes turns giving lectures in the school, allowing students to receive a lively class struggle education once a week on average. The students have initially understood what class, exploitation, oppression, and revolution are. Many students have excitedly expressed: "Remember the class bitterness, do not forget the blood grudge, follow Chairman Mao, and make revolution forever!"

3. They have thoroughly criticized the old educational system that separates education from productive labor and have vigorously implemented the policy of combining education with productive labor.

During the 1958 education revolution, the primary school students of this school also rushed out of the classroom and participated extensively in labor. However, soon, they were cut off by China's Khrushchev's agents in the educational field under the pretext of "labor affecting teaching quality." Through studying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the broad revolutionary teachers and students have strongly demanded "learning from workers and peasants." The school revolutionary committee has strengthened the leadership of labor education, and the teachers have also organized a labor guidance group. They have actively linked up with factories and rural areas to arrange for students to labor. Currently, high-grade students labor one day a week, and low-grade students labor half a day a week. Through labor, students have strengthened their labor perspective and gradually cultivated their class feelings for the laboring people.

4. They have thoroughly criticized the old injection-style teaching method and have established lively and active learning methods.

In the past, primary school classroom teaching was entirely teacher-centered, with the teacher lecturing and the students listening. The revolutionary teachers and students of this school have criticized this old injection-style teaching method and advocated lively and active learning methods. Now, even middle and high-grade students can go up to the podium to share their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, criticize the revisionist goods in the old textbooks that advocate class reconciliation, and expound their understanding and views on certain articles.

Their teachers include teachers from the school and old workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants from the old society who have deep bitterness. They have begun to learn rich knowledge about class struggle and production struggle.

The teaching methods are diverse and inspiring. When teachers lecture, they often propose questions to stimulate students' thinking and let students discuss and solve them themselves. Even when correcting students' notebooks, it is different from the past. When teachers encounter students' poor or incorrect homework, they do not write a comment to reproach the students as in the past, but analyze the reasons for the poor performance, and based on the students' specific situations and active thoughts, write a passage from the quotations of our great leader Chairman Mao to encourage the students.

5. They have criticized the "authority of the teacher" and established a new type of revolutionary teacher-student relationship.

The revolutionary teachers and students have together criticized the crimes of a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party who have been cultivating students' slavish ideology since childhood. In the past, a small handful of capitalist-roaders, under the pretext of "the teacher's leading role," often advocated "the authority of the teacher," promoted feudal patriarchal rule, and used coercive methods on students. Those who were not coerced into submission were labeled as "bad students." In addition to "coercion," they also used slavish education to bind students, praising those who obediently listened as "good students" and setting them as examples for other students.

Since the resumption of classes and making revolution, revolutionary teachers have vigorously encouraged students' revolutionary rebellious spirit. For the content in the textbooks that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and for the words and deeds of teachers that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, they encourage students to criticize. At the same time, teachers treat students with an equal attitude and discuss matters with students. In the past, when teachers participated in students' activities, they would always give a few instructions. Now, teachers and students together hold meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and teachers also participate as ordinary members, sharing their experiences and thoughts with students, conducting self-criticism. Students can also boldly give suggestions to teachers. Recently, this school has launched a campaign to study, memorize, lecture, and apply the "Three Articles" in depth. According to the usual practice, memorizing texts is always done by primary school students reciting to teachers; but now, many teachers lead the students in reciting the "Three Articles" in class, deeply moving the students.

After Chairman Mao's latest directives on the education revolution were issued, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students conducted serious study and discussion, researched specific measures for implementation, and held workers' parent meetings, "three-in-one" (teachers, parents, students) heart-to-heart talks, visited poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and sought their opinions on implementing the education revolution and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, gaining support and cooperation from all sides.

### 遵循毛主席教育革命的指示  一边进行教学一边进行改革  上海闸北区第三小学在复课闹革命中，大破修正主义教育路线，大立无产阶级教育路线

     遵循毛主席教育革命的指示
    一边进行教学一边进行改革
    上海闸北区第三小学在复课闹革命中，大破修正主义教育路线，大立无产阶级教育路线
    本报讯　上海市闸北区第三中心小学的革命师生员工，坚决贯彻毛主席、党中央关于复课闹革命的方针，以毛主席关于教育革命的指示为纲领，一边进行教学，一边进行改革。在教学实践中，大破以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。
    这个学校已经复课闹革命八个多月。广大革命师生一开始就带着怎样搞好复课闹革命问题，学习了毛主席的教导：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”毛主席的话，使他们心明眼亮：只有彻底批臭修正主义的教育路线，才能牢固地树立无产阶级的教育路线。
    怎样破？他们遵照毛主席关于“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的教导，抓住修正主义教育路线要害开刀，从以下五方面进行批判：
    一、大破智育第一、“唯有读书高”的剥削阶级教育思想，大立政治第一，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    “智育第一”、“分数第一”、“升学第一”的思想，在这个小学过去十分突出。广大革命师生对此进行了深入的揭发和批判。毛主席说：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”而修正主义教育路线，则宣扬“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”、“成名成家”、“个人奋斗”等剥削阶级的腐朽货色，毒害小学生的思想，摧残小学生的健康，培养修正主义的苗子。
    通过对智育第一的批判，大大加强了政治思想教育，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作高潮。他们把宣传毛泽东思想放在高于一切的地位，把学习毛主席著作作为最主要的课程，把学习和革命的大批判结合起来。
    二、大破“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”等修正主义谬论，大立从阶级斗争的大风大浪中培养无产阶级接班人的无产阶级教育思想。
    过去，这个小学的学生，从早晨“书声琅琅”到放学回家，从低年级大抓识字教学到毕业班大搞升学指导，过着围绕书本打转转的生活，成为经不起风雨的“温室里的花朵”。旧教材里塞满了阶级调和的谬论，讲课时也是抹杀阶级斗争。如把“中华人民共和国”解释为“中华民族的工人、农民、男人、女人和和气气地生活在一起的国家”，把“童养媳”解释为“从小就养在家里的媳妇”等等。许多革命师生在批判时愤怒地说，修正主义教育路线宣扬的是阶级调和的破调子，培养的是资产阶级的“花朵”！
    他们认真学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”把阶级斗争作为学校的一门主课。并采取“请进来”、“走出去”的办法，请学习毛主席著作积极分子和有丰富的阶级斗争经验的老工人来校讲课，和学生一起开批判会，启发学生和老工人比童年生活，组织学生到工厂参观、访问，听工人讲阶级斗争的血泪史。现在，一个由三十多位老工人组成的讲师团，经常轮流来校讲课，使学生每周平均能受到一次生动的阶级斗争教育。学生们初步懂得什么是阶级、什么是剥削、什么是压迫、什么是革命。许多学生激动地表示：“牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命！”
    三、大破教育与生产劳动相脱离的旧教育体制，大力贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。
    在一九五八年教育革命中，这个学校的小学生也冲出了课堂，广泛地参加劳动。但不久，就被中国赫鲁晓夫在教育界的代理人，以“劳动影响教学质量”为借口，把劳动课砍掉了。通过学习毛主席的“五·七”指示，广大革命师生产生了强烈的“学工、学农”的要求。校革命委员会加强了对劳动教育的领导，教师也组织了劳动辅导组。他们主动和工厂、农村挂钩，安排学生劳动。目前，高年级学生每周劳动一天，低年级学生每周劳动半天。通过劳动，加强了学生的劳动观点，逐步培养了学生对劳动人民的阶级感情。
    四、大破注入式教学，大立生动活泼的学习方式。
    过去，小学的课堂教学，都是教师讲，学生听，讲台完全为教师所独占。这个学校的革命师生，批判了这种旧的注入式教学方法，提倡生动活泼的学习方式。现在，中、高年级学生也能走上讲台，发表自己活学活用毛主席著作的心得、体会，批判党内最大的走资派，批判过去学习的课本中一些宣扬阶级调和论的修正主义货色，阐述自己对某篇课文的理解和观点。
    他们的老师，有学校里的教师，也有在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人、贫农、下中农。他们开始学到了阶级斗争、生产斗争的丰富知识。
    教学方式多种多样，富有启发性。教师讲课时常常提出一些问题，启发学生思考，由学生自己讨论解决。就是批改学生作业本，也和过去大不相同。教师遇到学生作业做得不好或做错了，不是象过去那样写上一段批语责备学生，而是分析做得不好的原因，针对学生的具体情况和活思想，写上一段我们伟大领袖毛主席的语录，来鼓励学生。
    五、破“师道尊严”，立新型的革命师生关系。
    革命师生一起批判了党内一小撮走资派从小培养学生的奴隶主义的罪行。过去，一小撮走资派借口“教师的主导作用”，经常宣扬“师道尊严”，提倡封建家长式的统治，对学生采取压服手段。凡是压而不服的，就是“坏学生”。除了“压”以外，还用奴化教育来束缚学生，表扬俯首贴耳听话的“好学生”，作为学生的“标兵”。
    复课闹革命以来，革命教师竭力鼓励学生的革命造反精神。对于教材中不符合毛泽东思想的东西，对于教师中不符合毛泽东思想的言行，鼓励学生起来批评。同时，教师以平等态度对待学生，有事与学生一起商量。过去，教师参加学生的活动，总是指手划脚讲几句。现在，教师与学生一起开毛主席著作讲用会，教师也以普通一员的身份，和学生一起谈体会，亮思想，进行自我批评。学生也能大胆地向老师提意见。最近这个学校掀起了大学、大背、大讲、大用“老三篇”的热潮。按照往常惯例，背书总是小学生背给老师听；可是现在，不少教师在课堂上带头向学生背诵“老三篇”，使学生深受感动。
    毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示发表后，全校革命师生进行了认真的学习、讨论，研究了贯彻执行的具体措施。学校召开了工人家长会、“三结合”（教师、家长、学生）谈心会，访问贫农、下中农，征求他们对实行教育革命，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的意见，取得了各方面的配合和支持。
