Art troupes in Albania have gone deep into the grassroots and faced the workers and peasants in the course of the cultural revolution. Many drama troupes, such as the "Skampa" professional troupe in Elbasan, went to the countryside at the beginning of this year's drama season to serve the members of agricultural cooperatives and herdsmen.

These troupes have performed many new plays, which have been warmly received by the audience. The themes of these new plays are mainly about socialist construction, especially about further carrying out the cultural revolution and further emancipating women and fostering new people for socialist society.

Some professional troupes have, while strengthening their cooperation with playwrights and composers this year, actively adopted the method of self-reliance to rehearse plays. They have achieved good results in increasing new plays and developing revolutionary national drama.

Albanian artists also performed the modern Chinese large-scale ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" in Tirana, which was warmly received by the audience.

    文艺团体深入基层面向工农
    许多剧团为工农演出思想文化革命的新剧目
    阿尔巴尼亚戏剧艺术团体在思想文化革命运动中，深入基层，面向工农。全国许多剧团，如爱尔巴桑的“斯坎帕”专业剧团在今年戏剧季一开始就深入农村，为农业社社员和牧民服务。
    这些剧团上演了许多新剧目，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。新剧目的内容都是有关社会主义建设，特别是有关进一步开展思想和文化革命以及进一步解放妇女和培养社会主义社会的新人为主题的剧目。
    一些专业团体今年在加强同剧作家、作曲家合作的同时，积极采取自力更生的办法排练剧目。他们在增加新剧目和发展革命的民族戏剧方面取得了良好的效果。
    阿尔巴尼亚艺术家们还在地拉那演出了中国现代大型芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
