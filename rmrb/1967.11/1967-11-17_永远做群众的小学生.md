Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the guiding principles for us to resolve the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. This is a matter of whether our cadres can remain incorruptible; whether our proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated; and whether we can carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. We warmly welcome the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must study them earnestly and resolutely implement them in our practical actions.

Cadres of the Communist Party are servants of the people. Everything must be done in the interests of the people. We must never detach ourselves from the masses, and we must humbly learn from the masses, never acting like officials or lords. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership is necessarily 'from the masses, to the masses.'" However, the Chinese Khrushchev has long pursued a revisionist line for cadres. He used "Self-Cultivation" to spread poison, inducing cadres to detach themselves from the fierce class struggle, from reality, and from the masses, acting like officials and lords. Today, we must thoroughly purge the revisionist poison of the Chinese Khrushchev based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has smashed the revisionist shackles that suppressed the revolutionary new forces, and a large number of revolutionary new cadres have emerged from the masses and entered the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams at various levels. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, dare to speak, dare to think, dare to act, dare to revolutionize, shoulder heavy burdens, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and fight selflessly. They are a new revolutionary shock force, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We old cadres must wholeheartedly support and help them. We deeply feel that in this regard, we are indeed not as good as them, and we need to humbly learn from them, learn from their vigorous and lively revolutionary spirit. Of course, since the new cadres are in the process of growth, they lack experience in leadership work and are bound to have this or that shortcoming in their work. However, we should not pick faults and criticize, but should wholeheartedly use our own mistakes to help them.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant." No matter who it is, as long as one forgets the masses, one begins to slide into the swamp of the bourgeois reactionary line. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, through the tempering of the mass movement, I have burned away some of my officialdom and stagnation, and together with the masses, I have criticized the revisionist line. In this way, I have shared the same feelings and language with the majority of the masses. In our work, we encounter some problems, and a few people discuss them back and forth without finding a solution; but once we go to the masses, mobilize the masses to discuss and deliberate, the problem is solved in no time. As Chairman Mao instructs: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and the most capable are the most experienced fighters." From this experience, countless facts have made me deeply realize: the fundamental issue for revolutionary cadres is to insist on the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be a student of the masses. One must never be arrogant.

In the process of learning from the masses, measured by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I am still far from adequate and need to make further efforts. The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent, and the movement is developing in depth. In this great struggle, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the masses, humbly learn from the masses, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses more, maintain close contact with the masses, and together with the masses, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    永远做群众的小学生
    上海市革命委员会领导成员、原中共上海市委书记处书记　马天水
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的最新指示，是我们解决上下级关系、搞好干部和群众关系的指针。这是关系到我们的干部能不能永不变质的问题；关系到我们无产阶级的政权能不能巩固的问题；关系到当前能不能搞好斗批改、把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的问题。我们热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表，我们一定要认真地学习，并且坚决贯彻到实际行动中去。
    共产党的干部是人民的勤务员，一切要从人民的利益出发，一刻也不能脱离群众，要老老实实地眼睛向下，当群众的小学生，决不能高踞于群众之上做官当老爷。毛主席教导我们：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却长期推行一条修正主义干部路线。他利用《修养》大肆放毒，诱使干部脱离火热的阶级斗争，脱离实际，脱离群众，做官当老爷。今天，我们一定要根据毛主席的最新指示，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义流毒。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命砸烂了压制革命的新生力量的修正主义枷锁，群众中涌现了一大批革命的新干部，进入了各级革命三结合的领导班子。他们无限忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，敢说、敢想、敢闯、敢做、敢革命，挑着重担子，站在斗争的第一线，忘我地战斗着。这是一支新生的革命突击队，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们老干部必须满腔热诚地支持他们，帮助他们。我们深深地感到在这方面确实比不上他们，需要老老实实地向他们学习，学习他们这种朝气蓬勃、生动活泼的革命精神。当然，由于新干部正处在成长的过程中，缺乏领导工作的经验，在工作中难免有这样或那样的缺点。但是，我们决不应挑剔责难，只看支流不看主流，而是应该满腔热情地用自己犯错误的教训，去帮助他们。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。无论什么人，只要一忘记了群众，就开始向资产阶级反动路线的泥坑中滑下去。我在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，通过群众运动烈火的锻炼，烧掉了身上的一些官气、暮气，和群众一起批判修正主义路线，这样才和大多数群众有了共同的感情，共同的语言。我们在工作中遇到有些问题，几个人在上面讨论来讨论去，都没有办法解决；可是一到群众中去，发动群众来商量、讨论，三下两下就解决了。这正如毛主席所指示的：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”从这一段经历中，无数事实使我深深体会到：凡是要革命的干部，最根本的问题就是一定要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。千万骄傲不得。
    在向群众学习的道路上，用毛主席的最新指示来衡量，我还是做得非常不够的，还需要进一步的努力。当前无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，运动正在向纵深发展。我在这场伟大的斗争中，一定要遵循毛主席的教导，到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，更加尊重群众的首创精神，密切同群众的联系，同群众一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
