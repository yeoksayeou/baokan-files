The American Progressive Labor Party's organ, the bimonthly "Progressive Labor," recently published an article commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The article condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the path of the October Revolution and points out that the Soviet people will ultimately restore proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

The article, titled "Defeating Imperialism and Modern Revisionism on the Path of the October Revolution," states that the great October Socialist Revolution established the world's first socialist state. The international bourgeoisie's attempts to reverse this trend were all repulsed by the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin. The Soviet people's victories over both domestic and foreign enemies are magnificent. They defeated the imperialist blockade and crushed the invasion of Hitler fascism. They also defeated internal enemies such as Bernstein, Kautsky, Trotsky, and other counter-revolutionaries.

The article points out that the modern revisionists, represented by Khrushchev and his current faithful followers, have betrayed the path of the October Revolution. However, these traitors will ultimately be crushed by the Soviet people and the international proletariat.

The article states that under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are learning from the experiences of the Soviet Union. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will ensure the strengthening and invincibility of China's proletarian dictatorship.

The article states that the Chinese people are currently advancing the historical experience of the October Revolution, forging ahead and blazing new trails. They are demonstrating that revolution is invincible and that the revolutionary process is irreversible.

The article emphasizes that Mao Zedong Thought enriches Marxism-Leninism, and the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution clearly demonstrates this. The people's war in Vietnam also clearly demonstrates this.

The article concludes by stressing that the Soviet people and the people of other countries will draw correct conclusions from the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Soviet people will ultimately restore the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union. The international proletariat and all oppressed peoples will certainly advance along the path of the great October Socialist Revolution.

    新华社伦敦电　美国进步劳工党机关刊物《进步劳工》双月刊，最近在一篇纪念十月革命五十周年的文章中，谴责苏修领导集团背叛了十月革命的道路，并且指出，苏联人民最终将会在苏联重建无产阶级专政。
    这篇题为《沿着十月革命道路击败帝国主义和现代修正主义》的文章说，伟大的十月社会主义革命建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。国际资产阶级妄图扭转这一事态发展的各种努力，都被列宁和斯大林领导下的苏联人民所击退。苏联人民粉碎国内外敌人方面的胜利是伟大的。他们击败了帝国主义的包围，并且打垮了希特勒法西斯的侵略。他们击败了内部的敌人如伯恩施坦、考茨基、托洛茨基以及其他反革命分子。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫及其现在的忠实追随者为代表的现代修正主义分子，背叛了十月革命的道路。但是，这些叛徒最终将遭到苏联人民以及国际工人阶级的粉碎性的打击。
    文章说，中国人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，正在从苏联的经验中吸取教训。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命将保证中国的无产阶级专政得到加强和不可战胜。
    文章说，中国人民今天正在把十月革命的历史经验推向前进，他们正在披荆斩棘开辟新的道路，他们正在表明，革命是不可战胜的，革命的进程是扭转不了的。
    文章着重指出，毛泽东思想丰富了马克思列宁主义，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命清楚地表明了这一点，越南的人民战争也清楚地表明了这一点。
    文章最后强调说，苏联人民和其他各国人民将从伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命中得出正确的结论，苏联人民最终将会重建苏联的无产阶级专政。国际工人阶级和一切被压迫人民一定会踏着伟大的十月社会主义革命的道路前进。
