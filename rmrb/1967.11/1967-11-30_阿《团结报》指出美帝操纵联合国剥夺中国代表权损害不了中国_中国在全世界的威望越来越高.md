The Albanian "Unity" newspaper published an editorial on November 26 pointing out that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, the United Nations will forever be just a tool for the imperialists and revisionists to conspire to dominate the world.

The editorial says that this year, the U.S. imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists, according to the conspiracy plotted in Glasboro, are attempting to further encircle and isolate the People's Republic of China, to damage its reputation in international public opinion, and to reduce its increasingly significant role in the development of international affairs.

The editorial points out that the more these despicable and shameless wolves howl, the higher China's prestige and dignity in the world will rise; the more they conspire against the great 700 million Chinese people, the stronger and more united the Chinese people will become.

The editorial emphasizes that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is triumphantly unfolding throughout China, has thoroughly smashed the imperialists' and Khrushchev revisionists' dreams of promoting revisionism and restoring capitalism in China, turning China into a strong bastion of socialism and communism. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the People's Republic of China gain more friends around the world and has greatly inspired the struggle of the people of various countries against imperialism and revisionism.

The editorial says that although the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists control the United Nations General Assembly, the voices of various countries supporting great China are becoming louder and louder. This voice is particularly strong through the representatives of the People's Republic of Albania, a faithful friend and comrade of the People's Republic of China, and representatives of many other Asian, African, and Latin American countries. They refuted the lies of Washington and its followers and emphasized that expelling the "representatives" of Chiang Kai-shek and replacing them with the true representatives of the 700 million Chinese people is not only an undeniable right of the People's Republic of China but also a necessary condition for the existence of the United Nations itself. Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, the United Nations will forever be just a tool for the imperialists and revisionists to conspire to dominate the world.

    阿《团结报》指出美帝操纵联合国剥夺中国代表权损害不了中国
    中国在全世界的威望越来越高
    新华社地拉那二十七日电  阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》二十六日发表评论指出，没有中华人民共和国的参加，联合国将永远只能是为实现帝国主义、修正主义共同主宰世界的阴谋的一个工具。
    评论说，今年，美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者根据葛拉斯堡罗策划的共同阴谋，妄图加紧包围和孤立中华人民共和国，在国际舆论中损坏它的声誉，缩小它在国际事态发展中所起的日益增长的巨大作用。
    评论指出，这些卑鄙无耻的豺狼们越是咆哮，中国在全世界的威信和尊严就越加提高；它们越是策划反对伟大七亿中国人民的阴谋诡计，中国人民就越是强大和团结。
    评论强调指出，正在全中国胜利开展的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者妄想在中国搞修正主义和复辟资本主义的美梦，使中国变成为社会主义和共产主义的强大堡垒。无产阶级文化大革命使中华人民共和国在全世界的朋友更加增多，使各国人民反对帝国主义、修正主义的斗争得到巨大鼓舞。
    评论说，尽管美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者操纵着联大，但是各国人民支持伟大人民中国的呼声越来越高。这一呼声通过在联大的中华人民共和国忠实的朋友和战友阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的代表以及亚、非、拉其它许多国家的代表显得十分强大。他们驳斥了华盛顿及其追随者的谰言，并且强调指出，驱逐蒋介石的“代表”，代之以七亿中国人民的真正代表，不仅是中华人民共和国无可否认的权利，而且是联合国本身存在的必要条件。没有中华人民共和国的参加，联合国将永远只能是为实现帝国主义、修正主义共同主宰世界的阴谋的一个工具。
