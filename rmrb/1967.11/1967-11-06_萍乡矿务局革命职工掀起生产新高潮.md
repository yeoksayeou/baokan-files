	Revolutionary workers of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau in Jiangxi, with the help of the leftist support troops stationed at the mine, have launched a vigorous production surge under the banner of "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism." The first battle of the fourth quarter has already been won. Since September, the total output of the entire bureau has increased each decade. The output in the first decade of October increased by 17% compared to the end of September; the output in the middle decade of October increased by 25% compared to the first decade. Since October, the daily output plan of the Qingshan Mine has almost been broken every day, and it has exceeded the plan by about 30% several times. The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Mining Bureau is full of confidence in striving to complete the production plan for the fourth quarter.

    萍乡矿务局革命职工掀起生产新高潮
    江西萍乡矿务局革命职工，在驻矿支左部队的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，掀起轰轰烈烈的生产高潮，第四季度的第一仗已经取得胜利。自九月以来，全局的总产量一旬高过一旬。十月上旬比九月下旬提高百分之十七；十月中旬又比上旬提高百分之二十五。青山矿十月份以来日产量计划几乎天天被突破，并多次超过计划百分之三十左右。矿务局的无产阶级革命派满怀信心地争取完成第四季度的生产计划。
