Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. To destroy, one must argue logically; arguing logically is to construct. The key is to destroy, and construction is within it.” To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must first focus on destruction, thoroughly and deeply criticizing the revisionist educational line and old educational system represented by China’s Khrushchev.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party vigorously promotes the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. In 1954, the old Beijing Municipal counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, under the personal supervision of its leader Peng Zhen, drafted the “Decision on Improving the Quality of Education in Beijing’s Primary and Secondary Schools.” This is a black directive that vigorously advocates “professionalism first,” “grades first,” “intellectual education first,” “grades first,” and “admission first.” The counter-revolutionary revisionist education officials Deng Tuo and Liao Misha shouted, “From now on, schools are first about teaching, second about teaching, and third still about teaching.” They fiercely opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought on the educational front, attempting to lead the youth down the path of focusing solely on professional skills and ignoring politics, cultivating successors for revisionism.

Beijing No. 1 Girls’ High School was one of the “key” schools cultivated by the old Beijing Municipal Committee’s counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, serving as the “tip” of their so-called “small pagoda” and a typical example of fully implementing the black directive. This is evident in the following aspects:

1. Grades are the first standard for admitting new students. As long as the grades are high, even those with poor political and moral character are admitted, while those with good political and moral character are not. This first hurdle excludes a large number of politically and morally good working-class and peasant children from entering school.

2. Politics serve business. In the past, the school stipulated that students’ political activities and meetings should not exceed one and a half hours per week. Students studying Chairman Mao’s works during lunch breaks were considered to be affecting their rest and were deemed illegal. Even if studying was allowed, it was implemented in the form of coursework. For example, some students could get 100 points on their “political current events” exams, but their political ideology was very poor.

3. There are numerous exams, and sudden tests are frequently conducted, forcing students to cram and causing mental stress, harming their physical and mental health. In addition to classroom questions, small tests, and comprehensive practices, there are also unit exams, final exams, and entrance exams. The exam methods are hostile to students, conducting sudden attacks. Some teachers first conduct surprise exams and then teach, while others first teach and then conduct exams. Some teachers even hide exam questions in their pockets and suddenly take them out to attack students, making students tense and prepared for exams in every class.

4. To pursue a high admission rate, the school stipulates that students in the first and third years can skip labor in the countryside as scheduled and can skip welcoming guests and political gatherings. For students with the hope of admission, they are force-fed like ducks, cramming them with supplementary lessons.

This revisionist educational system of “intellectual education first” greatly harms the physical and mental health of the youth. We, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing No. 1 Girls’ High School, clearly understand that whether or not to carry out an educational revolution is a matter of whether the proletarian revolutionary cause has successors, whether our country can forever remain red, and is also a matter of great concern to the world revolution. We are determined to shoulder the responsibility of the educational revolution, follow the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao, forge ahead, and strive to thoroughly destroy the old educational system, establish a proletarian educational system, and cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    “智育第一”摧残了青年身心健康
    北京市女一中　宋凤楼
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”进行无产阶级教育革命，首先要破字当头，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线和旧教育制度进行彻底的深刻的批判。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，极力推行反革命修正主义教育路线。一九五四年，旧北京市反革命修正主义集团在其头目彭真的亲自主持下，炮制出《关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定》。这是个黑纲领，它竭力鼓吹“业务挂帅”、“分数挂帅”，大搞业务第一，智育第一，分数第一，升学第一。主管教育的反革命修正主义分子邓拓、廖沫沙，叫嚷
  “学校从现在起第一是教学，第二是教学，第三还是教学”。他们猖狂地反对在教育战线上突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，企图把青年引向只钻业务，不问政治的邪路上去，培养修正主义的接班人。
    女一中是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团培养的“重点”学校之一，是他们搞的所谓“小宝塔”的“尖”，是全面贯彻黑决定的一个典型。突出的表现在以下几方面：
    一、分数的高低是录取新生的第一标准。只要分数高，政治思想品德差的也录取，反之就不能录取。这第一道关，就排斥了大量的政治思想好的工农子女入学。
    二、政治为业务服务。过去学校规定学生每周政治活动的会议时间不得超过一个半小时。学生利用中午时间学毛主席著作，被认为影响了休息，不合法。即使允许学习，也被落实到功课上。如有的学生的“政治时事”考试可得一百分，而政治思想却差得很。
    三、考试名目繁多，大搞突然袭击，迫使学生死钻书本，精神紧张，摧残了身心健康。除了什么课堂提问、小测验、综合练习以外，还有单元考、期末考、升学考等等。考试方法与学生为敌，大搞突然袭击。有的先抽考后讲课，有的先讲课后考试。还有的教师把考题藏在衣袋里，在讲课中突然拿出来袭击学生，弄得学生节节课都精神紧张，时刻准备考试。
    四、为了追求高升学率，学校规定初、高三年级学生可以不按规定时间下乡劳动，可以不参加迎宾、集会等政治活动。对有升学希望的学生，就象填鸭一样地拚命给他们补习功课。
    这种“智育第一”的修正主义教育制度，大大摧残了青年的身心健康。我们女一中广大革命师生清楚地认识到，搞不搞教育革命，是关系到无产阶级革命事业是否后继有人的问题，是关系到我们国家能不能永远保持鲜红颜色的问题，也是关系到世界革命的大问题。我们决心挑起教育革命的重担，按照伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，披荆斩棘，为彻底摧毁旧的教育制度，创立无产阶级教育制度，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人奋斗到底。
