With the spirit of seizing the day, Beijing's middle schools and primary schools have generally resumed classes, and revolutionary teachers and students are carrying out reforms while teaching, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In Tianjin, over 300 middle schools and primary schools have resumed classes and made revolution, with revolutionary teachers and students jointly studying reform plans.

In Heilongjiang, over ten thousand primary school teachers have raised their consciousness through study, and primary schools in cities and countryside across the province have gradually resumed classes.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on November 4, revolutionary teachers and students in Beijing's middle schools and primary schools have resolutely responded to the call to resume classes and make revolution by the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. With the spirit of seizing the day, they have actively resumed classes and made revolution. Currently, over 300 middle schools and more than 800 primary schools in urban and suburban areas of the city have basically resumed classes. Over a million middle school and primary school revolutionary teachers and students are carrying out the educational revolution with the slogan of "criticize and repudiate revisionism and selfishness" and with Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline for the educational revolution. They are teaching while reforming, determined to turn Beijing's middle schools and primary schools into vibrant Mao Zedong Thought schools.

Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, especially studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out the revolution to resume classes. Revolutionary teachers and students in Beijing's middle schools and primary schools have taken studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the current most central political task. They have studied diligently, deeply understood, and recognized that resuming classes and making revolution is beneficial for achieving revolutionary great unity under revolutionary principles, promoting and consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination; it is beneficial for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and selfishness and carrying out the school's struggle-criticism-reform, promoting the educational revolution; it is beneficial for cultivating and strengthening the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools and primary schools to a new stage.

Through study, many schools' revolutionary committees and great unity organizations have taken on the task of leading the revolution to resume classes. Many schools' revolutionary teachers and students, with the spirit of self-reliance and making do with what is available, have repaired doors, windows, desks, and chairs by themselves; teachers and students have jointly compiled teaching materials. Beijing's 23rd Middle School, 35th Middle School, 36th Middle School, Railway Third Primary School, Xichanglu Primary School, Xishiku Primary School, and Yangshan Primary School have all made achievements in this regard.

Many middle schools and primary schools have recently opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, teachers, and students. Revolutionary youngsters, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," have enthusiastically helped cadres and teachers who have made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, helping them to stand up and participate in leading the revolution to resume classes.

Recently, middle schools and primary schools in urban and suburban areas that had not yet implemented military training in the previous stage have all started military training.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tianjin on November 4, Tianjin City has recently had over 120 middle schools and over 200 primary schools gradually resume classes, resuming classes and making revolution.

For several months, Tianjin's middle school and primary school Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, students, and revolutionary cadres have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's March 7th Directive, seriously studied the experience of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School in carrying out revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes and conducting educational revolution. Recently, they have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, under the guidance of the PLA's task of implementing military training, organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, extensively learned and applied the "Three Articles," fiercely criticized "selfishness," and established "public spirit." Under revolutionary principles, most middle schools have achieved revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, laying the foundation for resuming classes and making revolution.

Tianjin's middle school and primary school revolutionary teachers and students, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres," have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, daring to let cadres take on work. Many schools have established or are establishing revolutionary committees or revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership teams, strengthening the leadership of resuming classes and making revolution.

Some middle schools and primary schools, following Chairman Mao's instruction of "learning as the main focus, also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie," have carried out reforms and arrangements in teaching content and course settings. Currently, all schools, based on teaching classes, with the slogan of "criticize and repudiate revisionism and selfishness," have established the system of studying Chairman Mao's works every day, and combined with carrying out the school's struggle-criticism-reform. Revolutionary teachers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students jointly hold discussions, seminars, and criticism meetings, jointly study, jointly write criticism articles, and jointly study reform plans and teaching outlines.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Harbin on November 4, Heilongjiang Province has recently universally opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes for primary school teachers. In one month, over ten thousand primary school teachers have participated in the study, accounting for more than 90% of the province's primary school teachers.

Through study, primary school teachers have greatly increased their love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; greatly enhanced their class struggle consciousness and two-line struggle awareness; greatly promoted teachers' breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, striving to transform their worldview; greatly strengthened revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, thus promoting the great criticism, consolidating and developing the great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, promoting the struggle-criticism-reform on the educational front. During the study period, approximately one-quarter of the primary schools that had not united have all united, and a batch of cadres have been liberated. Most primary schools have established three-in-one combination leadership teams. Primary schools in cities and countryside across the province have gradually resumed classes starting from October 10, presenting a great situation.

Heilongjiang Province's primary school teachers' Mao Zedong Thought study classes have several forms. Most are held by communes; a few are held by counties; some spend half the time studying in counties and half in communes.

    首都中小学普遍开学，革命师生遵照毛主席最新指示边教学边改革
    天津三百多所中小学复课闹革命，广大革命师生共同研究教改方案
    黑龙江十多万小学教师经过学习提高觉悟，全省城乡小学陆续开学
    据新华社四日讯　首都中、小学广大革命师生，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席、党中央关于复课闹革命的战斗号召，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，积极复课闹革命。目前全市城区和近郊区三百多所中学和八百多所小学基本上开了学。一百多万中小学的革命师生以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为教育革命的最高纲领，掀起了群众性的教育革命。革命师生一边教学，一边改革，决心把首都中、小学办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    活学活用毛主席著作，特别是学好和用好毛主席的最新指示，是搞好中小学复课闹革命的根本保证。首都中小学广大革命师生，把学习和执行毛主席的最新指示作为当前最中心的政治任务。他们认真学习，深刻领会，认识到复课闹革命有利于在革命的原则下，按班级实现革命的大联合，促进和巩固革命的三结合；有利于斗私批修和开展本校的斗批改，搞好教育大革命；有利于培养和加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，把中小学的无产阶级文化大革命推向新阶段。
    通过学习，许多学校的革命委员会和大联合机构，担负起复课闹革命的领导工作。许多学校的革命师生本着自力更生，因陋就简的精神，自己动手修理门窗、桌椅板凳；教师和同学结合，自己编写教材。北京二十三中、三十五中、三十六中、铁路第三小学、西厂路小学、西什库小学、仰山小学等中小学都在这方面做出了成绩。
    许多中、小学在最近开办了有干部、教师和学生参加的毛泽东思想学习班。革命小将遵照毛主席“惩前毖后，治病救人”的教导，热情帮助犯错误的干部、教师认识错误，改正错误，帮助他们站出来参加复课闹革命的领导工作。
    最近，城区和近郊区的一些前一阶段还没有实行军政训练的中小学已全部开始军训。
    据新华社天津四日电　天津市最近已有一百二十多所中学和二百多所小学陆续开学，复课闹革命。
    天津市中小学的红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，几个月来，坚决贯彻毛主席的“三·七”指示，认真学习天津延安中学以教学班为基础实行革命大联合和进行教育革命的经验。最近以来，他们认真学习了毛主席的最新指示，在执行军训任务的解放军指战员的帮助下，组织了毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，在革命的原则下，大部分中学实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，为复课闹革命打下了基础。
    天津中小学革命师生遵照毛主席关于“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，认真执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆放手让干部站出来工作。不少学校建立和正在建立革命委员会或革命三结合的领导班子，加强了对复课闹革命的领导。
    有些中小学校遵照毛主席“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的教导，在教学内容和课程设置等方面进行了改革和安排。目前，各校都以教学班为基础，以“斗私，批修”为纲，建立了天天学习毛主席著作的制度，并结合进行本校的斗批改。革命教师、革命干部和革命学生一起开座谈会、讨论会、批判会，一起学习，一起写批判文章，共同研究教改方案和教学提纲。
    据新华社哈尔滨四日电　黑龙江省最近普遍举办小学教师毛泽东思想学习班，在一个月的时间内，有十多万小学教师参加了学习，占全省小学教师总数的百分之九十以上。
    经过学习，广大小学教师大大增强了对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的热爱；大大提高了阶级斗争的观念和两条路线斗争的觉悟；大大促进了教师破私立公，努力改造世界观；大大加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，从而推动了革命的大批判，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进了教育战线的斗批改。在学习期间，全省约有四分之一没有联合起来的小学全部联合起来了，并且解放了一批干部。大多数小学建立了三结合的领导班子。全省城乡小学从十月十日起，已陆续开学，呈现出一派大好形势。
    黑龙江省的小学教师毛泽东思想学习班有几种形式，多数是以公社为单位举办的；少数是以县为单位举办的；也有的一半时间在县学习，一半时间在公社学习。
