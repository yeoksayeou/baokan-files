The Chinese "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Baghdad on the evening of the 13th for a friendly visit and performance in Iraq.

The "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe was warmly welcomed by government officials from Iraq's Ministry of Culture and Guidance and Iraqi artists at the airport. The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Iraq, Zhang Weiping, also went to the airport to welcome them.

In the airport lounge, Chinese and Iraqi artists had a cordial conversation. The Chinese artists presented their most precious Chairman Mao badges to the Iraqi artists. An Iraqi artist who had already collected many Chairman Mao badges enthusiastically told the Chinese artists, "I love Chairman Mao badges. Chairman Mao's thoughts are the truth."

In the reception hall of the hotel where the troupe was staying, Hakki Shebri, Director of the Film and Drama Administration of Iraq's Ministry of Culture and Guidance, and Zhao Yuan, Director of the Chinese "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe, both gave speeches.

Shebri said in his speech, "Iraq thanks the Chinese people for their support for the struggle of the Arab people against imperialism and for the liberation of Palestine." The Iraqi government and people value cultural and artistic exchanges and cooperation between Iraq and China.

Zhao said in his speech, "In the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and Israel, the Chinese people will always stand with the Arab people."
