	Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers in Beijing warmly received the heroic messengers of the Albanian people—the delegation of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association.

	The delegation of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association and Albanian military attaché to China, Comrade Hatu, accompanied by Vice Minister of National Defense Wang Shusheng, attended a celebration held by the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Beijing to mark the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation. The unit's leader extended greetings to the Albanian comrades on the occasion, saying, "We will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: 'No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together.' He enthusiastically praised the Albanian people for consistently holding high the banner of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, and for their immortal achievements in defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism and advancing the world proletarian revolution. He also praised the Albanian people for their ongoing revolutionary movement. He said, China's people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army feel immensely proud and honored to have the heroic Albanian army and people as their closest comrades-in-arms.

	Comrade Shefqet Peçi, head of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association delegation, also delivered a passionate speech at the meeting. He said, The Albanian people are very happy and proud because the two parties, two peoples, and two armies of Albania and China are fighting together to defend socialism and Marxism-Leninism, and in the struggle, we are constantly strengthening and consolidating our friendship.

	Comrade Shefqet Peçi enthusiastically praised the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, The Albanian people believe that the People's Republic of China, the greatest socialist power, has become the strongest bulwark of socialism and world revolution, and the unwavering defender of Marxism-Leninism. Its existence is a great victory for all humanity and the world revolution.

	After the celebration, the Albanian comrades listened to the soldiers' accounts of their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and visited the company, watched the soldiers' shooting demonstrations, and enjoyed the performances by the soldiers' amateur troupe. The soldiers held up portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," expressing their deepest feelings to the Albanian comrades. At the end of the visit, Comrade Shefqet Peçi, holding the hands of his Chinese comrades, warmly said, "We have seen here the deep friendship of 700 million Chinese people for Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian people. We will definitely convey your profound fighting friendship to the Albanian people and army."
