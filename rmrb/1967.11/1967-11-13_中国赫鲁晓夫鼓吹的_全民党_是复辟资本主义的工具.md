The great leader Chairman Mao personally founded and leads the Communist Party of China, which is a shining example of a proletarian party in the contemporary world. After World War II, the leadership of many communist parties, particularly the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was usurped by the Khrushchev revisionist traitor clique, degenerated and became lackeys of imperialism and servants of the bourgeoisie. The Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao, the most outstanding leader of the contemporary proletariat, at its helm, has become the backbone of the international communist movement and the world revolution. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations around the world have grown significantly and are becoming increasingly powerful. For this reason, domestic and foreign enemies of all kinds not only fear and hate the boundless Mao Zedong Thought but also maliciously direct their attacks at the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, attempting to weaken and sabotage the strongest fortress of the revolutionary people of the world. China's Khrushchev, in order to meet the needs of imperialism and the domestic exploiting classes, waves the red flag to oppose the red flag, attempting to turn our Marxist-Leninist party into a revisionist "Whole People's Party," to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and to turn the socialist system into the capitalist system.

"The seas are in turmoil, the winds rage across the continents." Now, China's Khrushchev, the most dangerous enemy, has been exposed. His heinous crime of attempting to turn the Communist Party of China into a "Whole People's Party" must be thoroughly settled!

Attempting to Replace the Vanguard of the Proletariat with the "Whole People's Party"

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class. Our party is great, glorious, and correct precisely because it is an advanced detachment of the working class armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Any revision or usurpation of the proletarian nature of our party is the greatest betrayal of the proletarian cause and a public betrayal of revolutionary interests.

China's Khrushchev is the biggest agent of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated our party and the number one schemer and conspirator attempting to usurp the nature of our party.

China's Khrushchev has long advocated: "Our party is the party of the masses, the party of the people." It is the "vanguard of the people." He also rambles on about how "the Communist Party represents the righteousness of humanity" and is "the organization of the smartest and most outstanding men and women." This so-called "party of the people" and "vanguard of the people" is nothing but a euphemism for the "Whole People's Party." What is "human righteousness"? What is the "smartest and most outstanding"? Different classes have different standards. In the eyes of the proletariat, eliminating bloodsucking parasites and building a society without exploitation or oppression is human righteousness; the vanguard fighters of the proletariat, who take the liberation of all humanity as their historical mission, are the smartest and most outstanding people.

However, all exploiting classes, from their reactionary class positions, have completely opposite views from ours. Who are the "smartest and most outstanding men and women" in China's Khrushchev's eyes? He repeatedly urges our party to "welcome" those who want to "find a way into the Communist Party," "rely on the Communist Party to reduce taxes," and "be able to 'get ahead' in the future." He openly defies Chairman Mao's directive that traitors are not allowed to rejoin the party, personally instigating a group of scoundrels to betray the party, then keeping these traitors within the party, protecting and promoting them, allowing a group of traitors and turncoats to infiltrate the key departments of the party and seize a portion of the leadership.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: The establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, marked the basic end of the stage of the new democratic revolution and the beginning of the stage of socialist revolution. At such a time of great revolutionary transformation, China's Khrushchev openly opposed Chairman Mao, calling on party members to "struggle to consolidate the new democratic system." In addition to bowing down to capitalists and praising "exploitation is beneficial," he also called on party members to lead the way in hiring workers and leading exploitation, loudly proclaiming: "Exploitation can still make one a socialist," "party members who become rich peasants still retain their party membership," "it's not scary to have 10,000 rich peasant party members in Northeast China," "party regulations and laws allow individual farming and hiring people, prohibiting exploitation is dogmatism." After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, China's Khrushchev was impatient to bring a group of representatives of the bourgeoisie into the party. He once said to a capitalist: "You have become a capitalist, and we have not persecuted you. Now you have joined the party, which is even better." If, as China's Khrushchev advocates, rich peasants and capitalists can be party members, and party members can lead exploitation, wouldn't our party become the party of rich peasants and capitalists?

On one hand, China's Khrushchev welcomes such people to join the party with a smile, on the other hand, he colludes with another major power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, using every means to restrict the recruitment of party members from workers, peasants, and soldiers. They viciously shout: The working class is complex, "there are also unreliable elements," "don't think that relying on the working class will solve the problem," "recruiting party members from the working class should be done slowly." He also imposes numerous restrictions on recruiting party members from poor and lower-middle peasants. They arbitrarily restrict the recruitment of party members in the People's Liberation Army, saying that it is a time of peace, the PLA has not been tested in war, the term of service is short, and they will retire in a few years. Thanks to the resolute opposition of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, their plot did not succeed.

Chairman Mao taught us: "In this world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." Here, isn't the traitorous face of China's Khrushchev exposed clearly?

As stipulated by the nature and historical mission of our party, the members of our party are mainly from the working class and other laboring people. Although the proletarian party also recruits people from classes other than the working class, they are not joining the party as representatives of other classes. From the day they join the party, they must abandon their original class positions and stand on the side of the proletariat. Marx and Engels said: "If people from other classes participate in the proletarian movement, then first of all, they must be required not to bring in any remnants of bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, etc., prejudices, but to unconditionally master the proletarian worldview." The task of the Communist Party is to thoroughly eliminate the system of exploitation and achieve communism. It is precisely because there are exploiting classes in the world that there is a need for the Communist Party. China's Khrushchev imposes this set of blood-stained bourgeois "party regulations and laws" on our party, which can only prove that he himself is a representative of the blood-sucking bourgeoisie.

It is clear that he wants to do this to confuse the class lines and attempt to usurp the proletarian vanguard nature of our party from an organizational perspective.

Promoting the Bourgeois Worldview, Conspiring to "Peacefully Transform" the Communist Party into the "Whole People's Party"

China's Khrushchev conspires to turn the Communist Party into the "Whole People's Party." While attempting to usurp the proletarian vanguard nature of the party from an organizational perspective, he has long been promoting the decadent bourgeois worldview to party members, corrupting the party's ranks ideologically.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology is still a long, tortuous, and sometimes very intense struggle. The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to transform the world according to its worldview." Chairman Mao has always taught party members to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements, strive to learn Marxism-Leninism, and seriously overcome non-proletarian thoughts, establishing a proletarian worldview. However, China's Khrushchev, with extremely treacherous methods, instills bourgeois egoism into party members. In his "Cultivation," he says: "Party members have their personal interests and personal development," "party members can only develop themselves in the process of striving for the development, success, and victory of the party." He has also repeatedly shouted: "Only by following the Communist Party can individuals succeed," "serving the people will bring personal benefits." China's Khrushchev, based on his decades of experience in political opportunism and "cultivation," summarizes the above language, which is permeated with the psychology of a big speculator, into "gain a small advantage, suffer a big loss, suffer a small loss, gain a big advantage," and says it is "the law of development in the opposite direction"; "it is not selflessness, but public self-interest."

For the public is for the public, for the private is for the private. What is this "public self-interest"? In essence, it is using public interests to serve private interests. China's Khrushchev's so-called "public" is "suffering a small loss," and his so-called "private" is "gaining a big advantage." What is "public" and "suffering a small loss"? They are merely means to achieve the despicable goal of "private" and "gaining a big advantage."

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works wholeheartedly for the interests of the people." "Communist Party members should never put personal interests first, but should always subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." However, China's Khrushchev wants party members to treat the party as a "joint-stock company," and when the company makes money, the shareholders benefit. This is truly vulgar philosophy and a self-exposure of his extremely ugly and filthy soul.

Lenin once said: "The theoretical victory of Marxism has forced its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists. Such is the dialectic of history." On one hand, China's Khrushchev peddles bourgeois egoism, on the other hand, he also puts on makeup and lipstick, covering up his "egoism" with a beautiful facade. He says things like: "Without personal interests, there is no collective interest. Personal interests concentrated together are collective interests. The interests of the state are not formed by the interests of 650 million individuals?"

According to China's Khrushchev's logic, it means that the "650 million people," whether they are workers, peasants, or capitalists and landlords, when their interests are concentrated together, they become "collective interests." Can the interests of the exploited classes and the exploiting classes be "concentrated" together?

According to China's Khrushchev's logic, party members all work for personal interests, and the personal interests of party members added together become the collective interests of the party. In other words, just like China's Khrushchev and his traitor clique, in order to save their own skins, they do not hesitate to betray the interests of the party; then they deceive the party's trust, using the positions they have stolen to do all sorts of anti-party and anti-socialist deeds. The personal interests of these people concentrated together become the collective interests of the party!? This is something that only a traitor's mouth can spew out!

Is it for the public or for the private? This is a fundamental opposition between the worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "What is communism? In a certain sense, communism is for the public. Communism can be called 'public' productionism, it is for the public." The core of the ideological system of the exploiting classes is the character "private." Based on his own decades of "experience" in "being a person," China's Khrushchev believes that as long as the character "private" erodes the fighting will of Communist Party members, turning them into the petty people he requires, who are always calculating personal fame and profit and always putting money first, and "peacefully transforming" the party ideologically, then the dream of turning the Communist Party into a bourgeois "Whole People's Party" can be realized. Of course, this is like "an ant shaking a big tree, laughably overestimating itself." Our party is a great, glorious, and correct party. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, for decades, it has withstood the "surroundings and suppression" and persecution of enemies with guns, as well as the attacks of enemies without guns using sugar-coated bullets. China's Khrushchev attempts to "disintegrate" our party through heart-piercing tactics, but the result is the opposite. Through the struggle against all kinds of class enemies, including China's Khrushchev, our party has never been as strong as it is now, with a powerful immune system that can resist any virus, never as solid and strong as it is now, and never as experienced and combat-ready as it is now to defeat any enemy in the world.

The So-Called "Whole People's Party" is a Pure Bourgeois Party

China's Khrushchev, like Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, tries every means to turn the Communist Party into the "Whole People's Party." In fact, the "Whole People's Party" is pure nonsense. Like states, parties are tools of class struggle. All parties are class-based. Party nature is the concentrated expression of class nature. There has never been a non-class, super-class party, and there has never been a "Whole People's Party" that does not represent the interests of a certain class. The so-called "Whole People's Party" is actually a pure bourgeois party. The central task of the Communist Party is to wage class struggle, seize power, consolidate power, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without these, it is not a true Communist Party.

After the basic completion of socialist transformation in our country, Chairman Mao timely reminded us: "In our country, the struggle to consolidate the socialist system, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, who will defeat whom, will still go through a very long historical period." China's Khrushchev, in order to create a "basis" for his "Whole People's Party," loudly proclaims: "In the future, there will be no more revolutionary struggles, no more land reform, and no more socialist transformation," "heroes have no place to use their strengths, there are no more landlord class and bourgeoisie, we have eliminated them." He rambles on about how "the main task of the party is to develop productive forces as quickly as possible," "the most important task of the state is to organize social life." China's Khrushchev's set of clichés has nothing new; it is the same kind of goods as Khrushchev of the Soviet Union's advocacy of "economic issues and production issues being at the center of party organization activities, at the forefront of the entire work of party organizations." Internationally, imperialism has not relaxed its efforts to launch wars of aggression against our country for a single moment; domestically, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are constantly stirring up trouble. Can our party abandon class struggle and bury itself in "developing productive forces" and "organizing social life"? No! A thousand times no! A million times no! We must develop productive forces quickly, and we must organize social life, but the most important task of our party is to never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us: Politics is the commander, the soul; political work is the lifeline of all economic work; we must "grasp the revolution and promote production." The great practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year and more has further proven: Only by firmly grasping class struggle, digging out all kinds of "time bombs," and thoroughly eliminating the biggest hidden danger within our party, can we ensure the rapid development of socialist productive forces and truly organize social life well. China's Khrushchev attempts to disarm the party with priest-like sermons to achieve his plot of creating a "Whole People's Party," which is a pipe dream. Party members nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought deeply understand: The enemy's soft knives are no more "kind" than hard knives; we will not fall for the tricks of class enemies.

In fact, China's Khrushchev and his ilk advocate the theory of the extinction of class struggle, boasting about "the whole people" and "equality," which is not about not waging class struggle or not emphasizing class struggle. On the contrary, these are precisely their methods of waging class struggle against the proletariat. This method has been used more than once by old and new revisionists. Chairman Mao taught us: For decades, the old Social Democratic Party and for more than a decade, modern revisionism have never allowed the proletariat to have any equality with the bourgeoisie. They fundamentally deny that the history of several thousand years of humanity is a history of class struggle, fundamentally deny the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, fundamentally deny the revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, they are faithful dogs of the bourgeoisie and imperialism, together with the bourgeoisie and imperialism, insisting on the ideological system of the bourgeoisie oppressing and exploiting the proletariat and the capitalist social system, opposing the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist social system. The facts are exactly like this. While welcoming some ghosts and demons, social dregs to join the party, China's Khrushchev is not restricting the recruitment of party members from workers, peasants, and soldiers? His set of reactionary lines is not precisely protecting a small handful of bad people while madly attacking a large number of revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres? China's Khrushchev, this old counter-revolutionary, when he lulls party members and does not want them to grasp class struggle, is precisely when he is launching a fierce attack on the party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. His long-cherished "Whole People's Party" is naturally also a tool for the bourgeoisie to attack the proletariat. It is just that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the class struggle deepens, the hidden enemies who want to usurp the party and the country have to add a layer of deceptive disguise.

The Means is to Create the "Whole People's Party," the Goal is to Establish the Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie

Chairman Mao taught us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the maintenance of their power." The central task of a party is to wage class struggle, to serve the seizure of power and the consolidation of power. What kind of political direction there is, what kind of party should be built. The bourgeoisie's agents who have infiltrated the party must first usurp the party before they can usurp the government. China's Khrushchev has long conspired to implement bourgeois dictatorship in China, pulling our country onto the capitalist road. He has never given up his wolfish ambition to usurp the nature and program of our party for a single moment.

As early as the initial period of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution. And the ultimate goal of all communists is to strive for the final completion of the socialist society and the communist society." However, China's Khrushchev madly wants our party to abandon the revolutionary banner of communism, "sincerely and sincerely implement the Three Principles of the People," and "under the banner of the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang" to carry out the revolution. He also shouts: Chiang Kai-shek is the "revolutionary banner," "realizing the Three Principles of the People is realizing our minimum program." With the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang as the program of the Communist Party, and Chiang Kai-shek as the "revolutionary banner," what is the difference between this party and the Kuomintang? Isn't this proof that China's Khrushchev has long been wearing the sign of the "Communist Party" and has been a faithful executor of Chiang Kai-shek's policy of "merging the communists"?

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Chairman Mao pointed out: The revolutionary united front "must be under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China. Without the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, any revolutionary united front cannot be victorious." However, China's Khrushchev openly advocates the parliamentary road, wanting our party to give up the leadership of the revolution, handing over the army to the Kuomintang, "the army becomes the national army, the national defense army, the security force, the self-defense force, the party branches, party committees, and political commissars of our army are abolished, and party organizations are abolished in the army." He wants our party to hand over the leadership after becoming officials in the reactionary government of the Kuomintang, "becoming officials of the central government," "becoming one of the government parties (note: referring to the government party of the Kuomintang government), not in opposition but in power." He also shamelessly says: This is "merging" and "making money." If we do as he says, wouldn't our party have long since degenerated into a revisionist party like Thorez and Togliatti, becoming a tool of the bourgeoisie?

The proletarian party wages class struggle and implements the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao taught us: "Summarizing our experience, concentrating on one point, is the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party) based on the alliance of workers and peasants, the people's democratic dictatorship." However, China's Khrushchev advocates: "We should reorganize the branches like this, everyone likes cultural classes, then we should have cultural classes," "branch meetings can be more lively, hold a one-hour meeting, perform two hours of plays, everyone likes clubs, then turn it into a club meeting." Here, class struggle is gone, the dictatorship of the proletariat is gone. The party becomes a cultural and entertainment organization, a cultural study class. If it can still be called a party, then it is the "singing party," the "dancing party," the "performing party." China's Khrushchev's set of goods is not still executing Chiang Kai-shek's "merging the communists" policy that he could not execute? Undoubtedly, such a party can only be a Petofi Club for the development of capitalism.

The basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country has caused China's Khrushchev's plot to develop capitalism to fail. However, he is not willing to admit defeat and, in collusion with another major power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, and in collusion with agents in various places, conspires to transform our party into a tool for subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism.

The reactionary policy of the Kuomintang to "merge the communists" has long become a laughing stock in history; the dream of the Japanese invaders to eliminate the Communist Party has made them suffer a catastrophic disaster; today, although China's Khrushchev uses the tactic of infiltrating our party and causing trouble and sabotage from within, he will still not escape the fate of failure. Seven hundred million people are united in hatred and are conducting a solemn trial of him!

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently proposed the great program of "criticizing the private and criticizing revisionism." "Criticizing the private and criticizing revisionism" is the fundamental policy to ensure the comprehensive and thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and is also the fundamental policy to strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of our party. We must seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's great program, under the guidance of this program, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of "Whole People's Party" and other revisionist poisons he spread. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, turn the entire party and the entire country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that our country will never change color, and successfully complete the great, glorious task entrusted to our party in the world revolution!

    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“全民党”是复辟资本主义的工具
    北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作中心组
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的中国共产党，是当代无产阶级政党的光辉榜样。第二次世界大战后，许多国家的共产党的领导核心，首先是为赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团所篡夺的苏联共产党的领导核心，蜕化变质成为帝国主义的走狗和资产阶级的奴才。以当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖毛主席为代表的中国共产党，则成为国际共产主义运动和世界革命的中流砥柱。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，全世界马克思列宁主义的党和组织有了很大发展，正在日益壮大。正是因为这样，国内外形形色色的阶级敌人，不仅极端害怕和仇视光焰无际的毛泽东思想，而且凶恶地把矛头指向伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，千方百计地要削弱和破坏全世界革命人民这一最强大的堡垒。中国赫鲁晓夫适应帝国主义和国内剥削阶级的需要，打着“红旗”反红旗，妄图把我们马列主义的党变成修正主义的“全民党”，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，把社会主义制度变成资本主义制度。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”。现在，中国赫鲁晓夫这个最危险的敌人已经被我们揪了出来。他妄图把中国共产党变成“全民党”的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算！
      妄图用“全民党”代替无产阶级的先锋队
      我们伟大的领袖毛主席一贯教导我们：中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队。我们的党所以能够成为一个伟大的、光荣的、正确的党，就是因为它是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级的先进部队。对于我们党的无产阶级先锋队性质的任何修正和篡改，都是对无产阶级事业的最大背叛，也是对革命利益的公开出卖。
    中国赫鲁晓夫，是混进我们党内的最大的资产阶级代理人，也是篡改我们党的性质的头号野心家和阴谋家。
    中国赫鲁晓夫早就鼓吹：“我们的党是群众的党，是人民的党”。是“人民先锋队”。他还胡说什么：“共产党就是表示人类正气的”，“是最聪明的最优秀的男女组织起来的”。所谓“人民的党”、“人民先锋队”，不过是“全民党”的代名词。什么“人类正气”，什么“最聪明的最优秀的男女”，不同的阶级有不同的标准。在无产阶级看来，消灭吸血鬼、寄生虫，建立没有剥削、没有压迫的社会，就是人类正气；以解放全人类为自己的历史使命的无产阶级先锋队战士，才是最聪明的最优秀的人。
    可是，一切剥削阶级，从他们的反动阶级立场出发，同我们的看法完全相反。中国赫鲁晓夫心目中的“最聪明的最优秀的男女”是些什么人呢？他一再要我们党“欢迎”那些要“到共产党里来找出路”、“要依靠共产党减轻捐税”、“为了将来能够‘吃得开’”的人加入我们的党。他还公然对抗毛主席关于叛徒不准重新入党的指示，亲自策动一伙败类叛党，然后把这批叛徒留在党内，加以包庇重用，使一批叛徒、自首分子钻进党的要害部门，篡夺了一部分领导权。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国的成立，标志了新民主主义革命阶段的基本结束和社会主义革命阶段的开始。在这样一个革命大转变的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫公开和毛主席唱反调，他号召党员“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”。他除了拜倒在资本家的脚下，歌颂“剥削有功”外，还号召党员带头雇工，带头剥削，大肆叫嚷：“有剥削还可以做社会主义者”，党员成为富农“仍保留党籍”，“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”，“党规党法上允许单干，允许雇人，不准剥削是教条主义。”在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成后，中国赫鲁晓夫又迫不及待地要把一批资产阶级代表人物拉进党内。他曾当面对资本家说：“你资本家也当了，也没有整你，又入了党，则更好了。”如果象中国赫鲁晓夫主张的那样，富农、资本家可以作党员，党员可以带头剥削，我们的党岂不成了富农的党，资本家的党了吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫一方面眉开眼笑地欢迎上述这样一些人入党，另一方面，他却伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，千方百计地限制从工农兵中吸收党员。他们恶狠狠地叫嚣：工人阶级队伍复杂，“也是有不可靠的”，“不要以为依靠工人阶级就没有问题”，从工人阶级中发展党员要“慢慢来”。他对于在贫下中农中发展党员也是百般限制。他们还蛮横地限制在解放军中发展党员。胡说什么现在是和平时期，解放军没有经过战争考验，服役期限短，几年就退伍了。由于毛主席的最亲密的战友林彪副主席的坚决反对，他们的这一阴谋才没有得逞。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”在这里，中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒嘴脸不是暴露得十分清楚了吗？
    为我们党的性质和肩负的历史使命所规定的，我们党的成员，主要是来自工人阶级和其他劳动人民。无产阶级政党虽然也吸收工人阶级以外的其他阶级出身的人，但是他们并不是作为其他阶级的代表来参加党的。他们从入党的第一天起，就必须抛弃他们原来的阶级立场，站到无产阶级的立场上来。马克思和恩格斯说过：“如果其他阶级中的这种人参加无产阶级运动，那末首先就要要求他们不要把资产阶级、小资产阶级等等的偏见的任何残余带进来，而要无条件地掌握无产阶级世界观”。共产党的任务是彻底消灭剥削制度，实现共产主义。正是因为世界上有剥削阶级存在，所以要有共产党。中国赫鲁晓夫把这种充满血腥气味的资产阶级“党规党法”加在我们党的身上，只能证明他自己是一个吸血成性的资产阶级代表人物。
    很明显，他所以要这样，就是要搅乱阶级阵线，妄图从组织上篡改我们党的无产阶级先锋队的性质。
    宣扬资产阶级世界观，阴谋把共产党“和平演变”成“全民党”
    中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋把共产党变成“全民党”，他在妄图从组织上篡改党的无产阶级先锋队性质的同时，长期以来，向党员宣扬腐朽的资产阶级世界观，从思想上腐蚀党的队伍。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”毛主席一贯教导党员，要积极参加三大革命运动，努力学习马克思列宁主义，认真克服非无产阶级思想，树立无产阶级世界观。而中国赫鲁晓夫却以极其阴险的手段，向党员灌输资产阶级利己主义。他在《修养》中说：“党员是有他个人的利益，个人的发展”，“党员只能在争取党的发展、成功与胜利中，来发展自己”。他还不止一次地叫嚷：“只有跟着共产党，个人才能成功”，“为人民服务，个人利益就会来”。中国赫鲁晓夫还根据他几十年搞政治投机的“经验”和“修养”出来的“秘诀”，把上述渗透了大投机商心理的语言，概括成“占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜”，并且说“是向相反方向发展的规律”；“不是大公无私，而是大公有私”。
    为公就是为公，为私就是为私，什么“大公有私”，说穿了，就是假公济私。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“大公”就是“吃点小亏”，所谓“有私”就是“占大便宜”。什么“大公”啦、“吃点小亏”啦，都不过是达到“有私”、“占大便宜”这个卑鄙目的的手段。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席一贯教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”中国赫鲁晓夫却要党员把党作为“股份公司”，公司赚了钱，股东就有利了。这真是地地道道的市侩哲学，也是他极端丑恶肮脏灵魂的自我暴露。
    列宁曾经说过：“马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者，历史的辩证法就是如此。”中国赫鲁晓夫一方面大肆贩卖资产阶级利己主义，另一方面，他又为自己梳妆打扮、涂脂抹粉，为“利己主义”披上漂亮的外衣。他说什么“没有个人利益即无整体利益，个人利益集中起来即是集体利益。国家的利益，还不是由六亿五千万个个体利益集成的？”
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑，就是说，“六亿五千万人”，不论是工人、农民，还是资本家、地主，把他们的利益集中起来，就是“整体利益”。难道被剥削阶级的利益和剥削阶级的利益能够“集中”一起吗？
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑，党员都为个人利益去工作，党员的个人利益加起来就有了党的整体利益。也就是说，象中国赫鲁晓夫和他的叛徒集团一样，为了保全自己的狗命，不惜出卖党的利益；随后又骗取党的信任，利用窃取到的地位干尽反党反社会主义的勾当，把这些人的个人利益集中起来，就有了党的整体利益！？这真是只有叛徒嘴巴里才能吐得出来的货色！
    是为公还是为私，这是无产阶级与资产阶级两种根本对立的世界观。林彪副主席说：“什么叫做共产主义呢？在一定意义上来说，共产主义就是为公，共产主义可以叫做‘公’产主义，是为公的。”而剥削阶级思想体系的核心，就是一个“私”字。中国赫鲁晓夫根据他自己几十年“做人”的体验，认为只要用“私”字磨灭了共产党员的斗争意志，变成他所要求的斤斤计较个人名利、处处钞票挂帅的庸人，从思想上“和平演变”了党，这样，把共产党变成资产阶级“全民党”的梦想就可以实现了。当然，这是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。我们的党是伟大的光荣的正确的党。在伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，几十年来，既经受住了拿枪的敌人的“围剿”、迫害，也抵抗了不拿枪的敌人施用糖衣炮弹的袭击。中国赫鲁晓夫企图通过钻心战术“瓦解”我们的党，其结果正相反，经过同包括中国赫鲁晓夫在内的形形色色的阶级敌人的斗争，我们的党从来没有象现在这样有着强大的可以抵抗任何病菌的免疫力，从来没有象现在这样巩固和强大，从来没有象现在这样具有足以战胜世界上任何敌人的丰富经验和无比的战斗力。
    所谓“全民党”，是不折不扣的资产阶级党
    中国赫鲁晓夫，同苏联的赫鲁晓夫一样，千方百计地妄图把共产党变成“全民党”。其实，“全民党”，这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。政党和国家一样，是阶级斗争的工具。一切政党，都是具有阶级性的。党性是阶级性的集中表现。从来没有什么非阶级的、超阶级的政党，从来就不存在不代表一定阶级利益的“全民党”。所谓“全民党”，实际上是不折不扣的资产阶级政党。共产党的中心任务是搞阶级斗争，夺取政权，巩固政权，加强无产阶级专政。不搞这些，决不是真正的共产党。
    在我国社会主义改造基本完成之后，毛主席及时告诫我们：“在我国，巩固社会主义制度的斗争，社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的斗争，还要经过一个很长的历史时期。”中国赫鲁晓夫为了给他的“全民党”制造“根据”，却大肆叫嚷：“以后，革命斗争也没有了，土地改革也没有了，社会主义改造也没有了”，“英雄无用武之地，现在再没有地主阶级，资产阶级给我们消灭了”。胡说什么“党的主要任务，就是尽快地发展生产力”，“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”。中国赫鲁晓夫的这一套滥调，并没有什么新“创造”，它同苏联赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“经济问题和生产问题居于党组织活动的中心，居于党组织整个工作的首位”，完全是一路货色。在国际上，帝国主义一时一刻都没有放松对我国发动侵略战争；在我们国内，地富反坏右时常在兴风作浪，难道我们党能够离开阶级斗争去埋头“发展生产力”和“组织社会生活”吗？不能！一千个不能！一万个不能！我们要尽快地发展生产力，也要组织社会生活，但是我们党头等重要的任务是念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂；政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线；要“抓革命，促生产”。一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，更加证明：只有狠狠抓住阶级斗争，挖出形形色色的“定时炸弹”，彻底清除我们党内的最大隐患，才能保证社会主义生产力的迅速发展，也才能真正组织好社会生活。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用牧师式的说教来解除党的武装，实现他搞“全民党”的阴谋，是痴心妄想。用毛泽东思想哺育起来的广大党员深深懂得：敌人的软刀子并不比硬刀子“仁慈”；我们决不会上阶级敌人的当。
    其实，中国赫鲁晓夫之流宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，侈谈什么“全民”“平等”，决不是不搞阶级斗争或不重视阶级斗争。恰恰相反，这些正是他搞资产阶级对无产阶级的阶级斗争的一种手法。这种手法，新老修正主义者也不止一次地用过了。毛主席教导我们说：几十年以来的老的社会民主党和十几年以来的现代修正主义，从来就不允许无产阶级同资产阶级有什么平等。他们根本否认几千年的人类历史是阶级斗争史，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的革命和对资产阶级的专政。相反，他们是资产阶级、帝国主义的忠实走狗，同资产阶级、帝国主义一道，坚持资产阶级压迫、剥削无产阶级的思想体系和资本主义的社会制度，反对马克思列宁主义的思想体系和社会主义的社会制度。事实正是这样，中国赫鲁晓夫在欢迎一些牛鬼蛇神、社会渣滓入党的同时，不是就百般地限制从工农兵中吸收党员吗？他炮制的一套资产阶级反动路线，不就是竭力保护一小撮坏人，却疯狂地打击一大片革命群众和革命干部吗？中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命，当他麻痹党员，不要党员抓阶级斗争的时候，正是他向党、向无产阶级专政发动猖狂进攻的时候。他梦寐以求的“全民党”，自然也是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的工具。只不过在无产阶级专政的条件下，随着阶级斗争的深入，暗藏的敌人要篡党篡国，不得不加上一层骗人的伪装。
    搞“全民党”是手段，建立资产阶级专政是目的
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”政党的中心任务就是搞阶级斗争，是为夺取政权和巩固政权服务的。有什么样的政治方向，就要建设什么样的党。钻进党内的资产阶级代理人篡政必先篡党。中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来阴谋在中国实行资产阶级专政，把我国拉上资本主义道路，他一时一刻也没有放弃篡改我们党的性质和纲领的狼子野心。
    早在抗日战争初期，我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。而一切共产主义者的最后目的，则是在于力争社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最后的完成。”而中国赫鲁晓夫却疯狂地要我们的党放弃共产主义的革命旗帜，“诚心诚意实行三民主义”，“在国民党三民主义这面旗帜下”进行革命。他还叫嚷：蒋介石“是革命的旗帜”，“实现三民主义即实现我们的最低纲领”。以国民党三民主义为共产党的纲领，以蒋介石为“革命的旗帜”，这样的党同国民党还有什么区别？这难道不是证明，中国赫鲁晓夫早就挂着“共产党”的招牌，充当了蒋介石的“溶共”政策的忠实执行者吗？
    抗日战争胜利后，毛主席指出：革命统一战线“必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。”而中国赫鲁晓夫却公开鼓吹议会道路，要我们党放弃对革命的领导权，把军队交给国民党，“军队成为国军、国防军、保安队、自卫队，我军的支部、党委会、政治委员取消，在军队中是取消党的组织”。他要我们党交出领导权后，到国民党反动政府里去“做官，中央政府的官”，“成为政府党（按：指国民党政府的政府党）之一，不是在野而是在朝了”。他还厚颜无耻地说：这是“化得来的”、“赚钱的”。如果照他这样去做，我们的党不是早就堕落成多列士、陶里亚蒂之流的修正主义党，变成资产阶级的御用工具了吗？
    无产阶级政党是搞阶级斗争的，是搞无产阶级专政的。毛主席教导我们说：“总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。”而中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹说：“我们要改组支部就照这样改组，大家喜欢文化班就搞文化班”，“支部大会，可以活泼一点，开一个钟头会，演两个钟头戏，大家喜欢俱乐部，就把它变成俱乐部会”。在这里，阶级斗争不见了，无产阶级专政不见了。党成了文化娱乐团体，成了文化学习班。如果还能叫做党，那就是“唱歌党”、“跳舞党”、“演戏党”。中国赫鲁晓夫的这一套货色，不仍然是在执行着蒋介石所无法执行的“溶共”政策吗？毫无疑问，这样的党只能是为发展资本主义服务的裴多菲俱乐部。
    我国生产资料所有制社会主义改造的基本完成，使中国赫鲁晓夫发展资本主义的阴谋计划破产了。但是，他并不甘心失败，又伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，并串通在各地的代理人，阴谋把我们的党改造成颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。
    国民党反动派“溶共”的反动政策早已成了历史的笑柄；日本侵略者消灭共产党的梦呓，使它自己遭到了灭顶之灾；今天，中国赫鲁晓夫虽然采用的是钻进我们党内、从内部进行捣乱、破坏的战术，但是同样逃脱不掉失败的命运，七亿人民正同仇敌忾，对他进行严正的审判！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近提出“斗私，批修”的伟大纲领。“斗私，批修”，是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得全面彻底胜利的根本方针，也是加强我们党的思想建设和组织建设的根本方针。我们必须认真学习和深刻领会毛主席的这一伟大纲领，在这一纲领的指导下，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒批臭，彻底肃清他散布的“全民党”以及其他的修正主义毒素。我们要大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把全党全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校，保证我们的国家永不变色，胜利完成历史赋予我们党在世界革命中担负的伟大光荣任务！
