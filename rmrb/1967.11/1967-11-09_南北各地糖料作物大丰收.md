The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the sugar crop-producing areas of our country have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasped revolution firmly, and promoted production vigorously. Under the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has won decisive victories, they have won a bumper harvest of sugar crops. The main sugar cane-producing areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Yunnan provinces and autonomous regions have all seen better growth of sugar cane compared to last year, presenting a scene of bumper harvests everywhere. At present, sugar beets have been harvested in various places, with the total output increasing by more than 20 percent over the bumper harvest of last year, making it the best harvest year in history.

Since October, sugar mills in various places have started crushing sugar one after another. Because of the abundant raw materials, good news of increased production has been frequently reported.

    南北各地糖料作物大丰收
    我国糖料作物产区的广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，夺得了糖料作物大丰收。甘蔗主要产区的广东、广西、福建、云南等省和自治区，甘蔗的长势都好于去年，都是一派大丰收的年景。目前各地甜菜已收割完毕，总产量比丰收的去年又增长二成以上，是历史上收成最好的一年。
    十月份以来，各地制糖厂陆续开工榨糖。由于原料充沛，频频传出增产喜讯。
