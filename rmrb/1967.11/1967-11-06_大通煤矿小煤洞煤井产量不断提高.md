The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat at the small coal mine in Datong Coal Mine, Qinghai, are resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are continuously increasing the output of raw coal, and the quality of the coal has also significantly improved.

In September, the raw coal production of this coal mine exceeded the monthly production target by more than 4,500 tons. Due to the substantial overproduction of this coal mine, the entire mine exceeded the state plan and achieved the highest monthly production level so far this year. The production plan for October was also completed ahead of schedule by ten days.

    大通煤矿小煤洞煤井产量不断提高
    青海大通煤矿小煤洞煤井的无产阶级革命派，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，不断提高原煤产量，煤的质量也有显著提高。
    九月份这个煤井的原煤生产，超额四千五百多吨完成了月产任务。由于这个煤井的大幅度超产，全矿超额完成了国家计划，出现了今年以来的月产量最高水平。十月份生产计划也提前十天超额完成。
