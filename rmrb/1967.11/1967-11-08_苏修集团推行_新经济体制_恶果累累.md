The Soviet revisionist clique is hurriedly promoting what they call the "new economic system," which is a thoroughly capitalist economic system. It is a major step in their attempt to fully restore capitalism in the economic sphere.

	Promoting Profit as the Motto, Encouraging Free Competition

After seizing control of the Party and the state, the Khrushchev revisionist clique, in order to serve the interests of the bourgeois class they represent, has been relentlessly destroying the socialist economic foundation and establishing a new system of exploitation that fits their bourgeois dictatorship. Their hired scholar Liberman, under Khrushchev's instructions, published an article titled "Planning, Profit, and Bonuses" in *Pravda* in 1962. At that time, the Soviet revisionist clique hyped it up and created public opinion to pave the way for the "new system" they were determined to implement. However, Khrushchev did not have the chance to fully implement it before he was overthrown. The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique, upon taking power, immediately accelerated the implementation. They decided in late 1964 to first trial it in 400 light industry enterprises, and by early 1965, they expanded it to heavy industry. Subsequently, it was extended to the automobile transport, commercial, supply, and food industries. In September 1965, at the Soviet revisionist Central Committee plenum, they issued the so-called "Regulations on Socialist State-Owned Production Enterprises," legalizing it through resolutions and decrees. Starting in January 1966, they openly and brazenly implemented it nationwide. So far, more than 5,500 enterprises have adopted the "new system," accounting for one-third of the total industrial output. By 1968, all enterprises in industry, transportation, and other sectors will basically be fully implementing the "new system."

The core of the Soviet revisionist clique's "new system" is to use various measures to encourage enterprises to pursue profits and to drive production through material incentives. It expands the autonomy of enterprise operations, vigorously promotes the adjustment of production according to market conditions, and expands the authority of enterprise leaders to hire, fire, and reward workers. These measures turn socialist state-owned enterprises into capitalist enterprises, replacing socialist planned economy with capitalist free competition.

The implementation of the "new system" has brought serious consequences to the Soviet economy, causing production chaos, significantly lowering product quality, and failing to complete production plans. It has also led to rampant speculation and theft, further exacerbating class division.

	Enterprises Pursue Profits, Production in Chaos

To make more profits, factories and enterprises adjust production according to market conditions, leading to increasing supply and sales disputes. The "Shoe Trade Management Office" in Kazakhstan originally insisted that the republic's industrial organization produce fine wool boots, promising to sell 600,000 pairs a year. However, when new products appeared in the market, the commercial staff automatically reduced the sales volume by nearly half of the original order, causing a large accumulation of these boots.

Many enterprise leaders, in order to maintain the profit rate, are unwilling to improve product quality. The Minsk State Bearing Factory is unwilling to improve the precision of 14mm diameter balls by one level. Although this improvement can extend the life of the balls by 20%, it would cost an additional 30,000 rubles per year, thus reducing the profit rate, so the factory leader firmly refused.

Due to the production chaos caused by the "new system," many enterprises lack raw materials and have to reduce production or shut down.

Many enterprise leaders, in pursuit of profits, force workers to falsify records, cut corners, and secretly or indirectly raise prices. The manager of a certain garment factory gave workers a piece of wet raw material, 40 meters long, which, after stretching and drying, became 2-3 meters longer. After making the clothes and selling them, they shrank when they got wet, becoming too small to wear. Some fertilizer plants produce fertilizer that turns into rocks in the hands of consumers. The Soviet revisionist press says, "Sometimes it even becomes rocks as large as an entire car." Half of the products from the Bryansk Machine Manufacturing Plant are defective and unusable, and the same is true in Russia.

	Underground Factories Flourish, Free Trade of Production Materials

Many enterprises have set up underground factories, engaging in speculation and making huge profits. The design bureau of the Leningrad Construction Materials Bureau has 104 "unofficial workers" (those not registered on the worker list), and these "unofficial workers" earn money that is openly shared with the bureau chief, factory director, and the like. The chief engineer, deputy director, and workshop director of the Almaty Fruit Plant formed a gang, privately settled raw materials, and thus obtained a large amount of sugar, oil, milk, etc. outside the books, which they then sold through their accomplices in the commercial network, embezzling more than a million rubles. The director of a construction site in Tajikistan, colluding with his cronies, used his authority to embezzle a large amount of construction materials by overreporting and forging invoices, and then sold them, embezzling more than 10,000 rubles in a year. The chief engineer of a sewing and knitting factory, in collusion with the factory director, set up an underground factory, establishing unaccounted-for raw materials and fabric reserves, producing and selling their own products. They have property worth tens of millions of rubles in Odessa, Sverdlovsk, and other places.

Enterprises not only freely buy and sell products but also arbitrarily sell production materials to increase the "profit rate" and obtain "bonuses." The Soviet revisionist clique openly declared that the planned supply of production materials is "outdated" and stipulated that enterprises can sell or rent so-called "excessive unused equipment and tools."

Many enterprises, under the pretext of "avoiding excess equipment," have massively "written off" and "sold" so-called "worn-out" and "excessive" equipment. Last year, the Tashkent Tractor Factory "wrote off" 216,000 rubles of wear and tear and sold 127,000 rubles worth of "excessive equipment." Gorky and Sverdlovsk also held free markets for buying and selling production materials, with thousands of company representatives from various regions of the Soviet Union participating, trading in production materials from machine tools, cranes, generators, gasoline, seamless steel pipes, instruments to locomotives.

	Leaders Hold Absolute Power, Workers Suffer Brutal Oppression

Enterprise leaders use their authority to brutally oppress and exploit workers. They arbitrarily fire workers, deduct wages, and embezzle workers' labor fruits.

To increase the "profit rate," five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad laid off 239 people in five months, accounting for 4% of the total workforce. The "Red October" Steel Plant, after adopting the "new system," decided to "eliminate two workshops" to gain more profits, laying off 730 workers. Some enterprises hire more workers during busy production periods and lay off workers during idle periods by giving them "indefinite leave," causing a large number of workers to be unemployed and a large amount of labor force to flow.

While laying off a large number of workers, the brutal exploitation of apprentices and child laborers has become a common phenomenon in Soviet enterprises. Many enterprise leaders force apprentices and child laborers to work like adults, even exceeding the workload of adults. The "Metal Worker" Factory in Sverdlovsk and the Dawn State Farm, to exploit cheap labor, employ child laborers, extend working hours, and make them do heavy adult work. These child laborers have very low wages and are always at risk of being fired.

	Income Gap Widens, Class Division Accelerates

According to the Soviet revisionist "new system," a large portion of the enterprise's profits is directly embezzled or indirectly used for the privileged class by the enterprise leaders and a small group of engineers. Soviet newspapers reveal that most of the profits left to enterprises are used for bonuses and so-called "welfare facilities." For example, the Moscow Thermal Automatic Equipment Factory uses 50% of the remaining profits for rewards, 26% for cultural facilities and housing construction, and only 24% for "production development." Some enterprises have 90% of their over-plan profits at their own disposal. The "State Enterprise Regulations" stipulated by the Soviet revisionists also state that the profits from self-produced and self-sold products outside the plan are entirely at the disposal of the enterprise.

Because the Soviet revisionist leadership gives enterprise leaders a lot of power, they can "set the indicators and conditions for rewarding workers," allowing them to embezzle a large amount of bonuses for personal gain. The manager of the Lipetsk Industrial Construction Trust received seven bonuses in just one month, totaling more than 1,300 rubles, exceeding the two-year salary of an ordinary worker. Some enterprise leaders' bonuses account for 60%. Some enterprise leaders receive bonuses every month, while some workers do not receive a single penny. Many enterprise workers not only do not receive bonuses but also have their wages significantly reduced. In two self-supporting automobile depots in Leningrad, the wages of auxiliary workers decreased by 9%, while the leaders' wages increased by 40%.

Enterprise leaders not only have high salaries and many bonuses but also the so-called "welfare facilities" of the enterprise are actually for a small privileged class to use and occupy. The privileged class can have several rooms and villas, free medical treatment, etc., while workers have housing difficulties, living hardships, and cannot enjoy cultural welfare.

Due to the implementation of this "new system," the socialist distribution principle of "from each according to their ability, to each according to their work" has been completely destroyed. The income gap between enterprise leaders, engineering and technical personnel, senior staff, and workers is widening. A small privileged class is becoming richer, while the vast majority of workers are becoming poorer.

	Soviet People Strongly Oppose, Imperialists Cheer

However, the "new system" has encountered strong opposition and dissatisfaction from the Soviet people during its implementation. After Liberman proposed this in 1962, people immediately exposed its reactionary essence of fully restoring capitalism. They pointed out that if these measures were adopted, the national economy would be seriously disrupted, the planned economy would be abolished, and the achievements of the October Revolution would be lost. The Soviet people angrily said, "Now it's all about the ruble!" Workers with a glorious revolutionary tradition in the Soviet Union said well, "What new system? It's just making us workers work more for them!" This truly exposed the reactionary essence of the "new system."

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique's promotion of the "new system" to fully restore capitalism has been cheered by imperialists and reactionaries around the world. The mouthpiece of the American monopolies, the *Wall Street Journal*, joyfully said, "Welcome (the Soviet revisionist ruling clique) to join our club." Some bourgeois scholars also proudly said, "The Soviet Union has returned to the capitalist era of regulating economic relations through the market." The enemy's applause and praise further exposed that the "new system" advocated by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is the same as the capitalist principle of profit-seeking.

Chairman Mao taught us ten years ago: "The proletariat will inevitably defeat the bourgeoisie, socialism will inevitably defeat capitalism, and oppressed nations will inevitably defeat imperialism. Of course, there are still difficulties and twists and turns ahead for the people. But as Lenin said 36 years ago, 'The important thing is that the ice has been broken, the route has been opened, and the way has been shown.' Where there is oppression and exploitation, there will be resistance and struggle. No matter what tricks the Soviet revisionist ruling clique uses or what beautiful words they use to decorate themselves, they cannot deceive the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Soviet Union. The Soviet people will never allow themselves to be slaughtered and will inevitably rise up to revolt, thoroughly smashing all the shackles of the Soviet revisionists' restoration of capitalism."

    苏修集团推行“新经济体制”恶果累累
    本报讯　苏修集团正在加紧推行的所谓“新经济体制”，是一套彻头彻尾的资本主义经济体制，是他们在经济领域中全面复辟资本主义的一个重大步骤。
             推行利润挂帅　大搞自由竞争
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了党和国家的领导权以后，为了谋求他们所代表的资产阶级特权阶层的私利，千方百计破坏和摧毁社会主义的经济基础，建立和发展一个与其资产阶级专政的政权相适应的新的剥削制度。他们的御用学者利别尔曼在赫鲁晓夫授意下，于一九六二年在《真理报》上抛出了《计划、利润、奖金》一文。当时苏修集团就大肆吹捧，制造舆论，为推行他们决心要搞的“新体制”开道。可是，赫鲁晓夫还没有来得及放手试行就垮了台。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团一上台就迫不及待地加紧推行。他们在一九六四年底决定首先在四百个轻工业企业中试行，一九六五年初推广到重工业，随后扩展到汽车运输、商业、供应机构和食品工业中试行；一九六五年九月又在苏修中央全会上颁布了所谓《社会主义国营生产企业条例》，竟然用决议和法令形式使之合法化。一九六六年一月开始，就明目张胆地正式在全国普遍推行。到目前为止，实行“新体制”的企业已有五千五百多个，他们的生产占全部工业产品的三分之一。计划到一九六八年，所有的工业、运输业和其他部门的企业将基本上完全实行“新体制”。
    苏修集团的这套所谓“新体制”的中心，就是以各种措施鼓励企业追逐利润，依靠物质刺激推动生产。它扩大企业经营的自主权，大力推行按市场行情调节生产的制度，扩大企业负责人对职工的招收、解雇和奖惩的权力。这一系列措施，就把全民所有制的社会主义企业变成为资本主义企业，以资本主义的自由竞争代替了社会主义的计划经济。
    苏修集团实行“新体制”，已给苏联的经济带来了严重的恶果，不仅造成生产混乱，产品质量大大下降，生产计划不能完成，而且投机盗窃成风，进一步加剧阶级分化。
            企业唯利是图　生产一片混乱
    为了多赢利，工厂企业都按市场行情来调节生产，供销纠纷日益尖锐。哈萨克“靴鞋贸易管理处”原来坚决要求共和国工业组织生产细毛毡靴，答应一年销售六十万双，而当市场上出现了新产品以后，商业工作人员就自动削减了几乎占原订量一半的销售量，使这种毡靴大量积压。
    许多企业的负责人为了保持赢利率，不愿提高产品质量。明斯克市国营轴承厂，不愿把直径为十四毫米的滚珠精确度提高一级。尽管这种改进可使滚珠寿命延长百分之二十，但是每年却要多开支三万卢布，这样就降低了赢利率，于是工厂负责人坚决不干。
    由于“新体制”所造成的生产混乱，许多企业原料不足，不得不减产或停工。
    不少企业的负责人，为了追逐利润，强迫工人弄虚作假，偷工减料，暗地或变相提高价格。某服装工厂负责人给工人一块湿货原料，长四十米，经过拉幅烘干后竟拉长了二、三米之多。制成服装出售后遇水抽缩，小得不能再穿。有些化肥厂出产的化肥到了消费者手里变成了石块，苏修报刊说，“有时甚至成了有整个车厢大小的大石块。”布良斯州机器制造厂的产品一半是废品，不能使用，俄罗斯也是一样。
              地下工厂风行　生产资料自由买卖
    许多企业还纷纷开设地下工厂，进行投机倒把，牟取暴利。列宁格勒建筑材料总局的设计局就有一百零四名“非正式工作人员”（指工人登记表上没有的人），而这些“非正式工作人员”挣得的钱，公开和局长、厂长之类的头头们均分。阿拉木图果品厂的总工程师、副厂长、车间主任结成一伙，私自报销原料，从而获得许多账外的糖、油、牛奶等，然后再把它通过他们在商业网中的同谋卖出去，盗窃了百余万卢布。塔吉克一修建工区主任，勾结亲信，利用职权，用多报多领、假造货单的办法侵吞了大批建筑材料，然后再卖出去，一年中贪污一万多卢布。一个缝纫针织厂的总工程师，伙同厂长搞了个地下工厂，建立了不入账的原料、布匹贮备，制造和出售他们自己的产品。他们在敖德萨、斯维尔德洛夫斯克等地有价值数十万卢布的财产。
    各个企业不仅把产品大做自由买卖，而且随意出售生产资料，以提高“赢利率”，骗取“奖金”。苏修集团公开宣布：生产资料的计划供应“已经过时”，并且规定企业可以出售、出租所谓“多余的不用的设备、工具”。
    许多企业借口“避免装备过剩”，大量地自行“报销”和“出卖”所谓已“损耗了的”和“过剩的”装备。去年塔什干拖拉机厂就自行“报销损耗”二十一万六千卢布，出卖“多余的装备”十二万七千卢布。高尔基市和斯维尔德洛夫斯克还举办了买卖生产资料的自由市场，参加的有苏联各地区的公司企业代表数千人，买卖的生产资料，从机床、起重机、发电机、汽油、无缝钢管、仪表到火车头，无所不有。
               负责人独揽大权　工人遭受残酷压迫
    企业的负责人利用他们的职权，对职工进行残酷的压迫和剥削。他们任意解雇工人，克扣工资，多占“奖金”，侵吞职工的劳动果实。
    为了提高“赢利率”，莫斯科和列宁格勒五家汽车公司在五个月中就裁减了二百三十九人，占职工总数的百分之四。“红十月”钢铁工厂在改行“新体制”后，为了获得更多的利润，“决定撤销两个车间”，裁减七百三十名工人。有的企业生产忙时则多招工人，生产闲时则以无限期的给工人“放假”的办法，排除大量工人，这就造成了大批工人失业，大量的劳动力流动。
    在大量裁减工人的同时，残酷地剥削徒工和童工在苏联的企业中已成普遍现象。许多企业负责人强迫徒工和童工同成年工人一样劳动，甚至超过成年工人。斯维尔德洛夫斯克“金属工人”厂和曙光国营农场为剥削廉价劳动力，雇用童工，延长工时，还让他们干成年人的重活。这些童工工资极低，而且随时有被开除的危险。
           收入差距日益扩大　阶级分化加速进行
    根据苏修“新体制”的规定，企业的利润，很大一部分被企业领导人及工程师等一小撮特权阶层所直接侵吞或变相地为特权阶层服务。苏联报刊透露，留给企业的利润大部分用于奖金及所谓“福利设施”。如莫斯科热力自动装置工厂，将留下的利润百分之五十用于奖励，百分之二十六用于文化设施和住宅建设，只有百分之二十四用于“发展生产”。有些企业的超计划利润百分之九十归企业自行支配。苏修制定的“国营企业条例”还规定自产自销计划外的产品，所获利润全部由企业支配。
    由于苏修领导集团给予企业负责人很大的权力，他们可以“规定奖励工人的指标和条件”，他们就可以假公济私，任意侵吞大批的奖金。利佩茨克工业建筑托拉斯的经理仅仅在一个月内就拿了七次奖金，总共一千三百多卢布，超过一般工人两年的工资还多。有的企业领导人的奖金占百分之六十。有些企业领导人事事得奖，月月得奖，而有些工人连一分钱也得不到。许多企业的工人不但得不到奖金，连工资也在大量下减，列宁格勒两家自负盈亏的汽车场，辅助工人的工资下降了百分之九，而领导人的工资却上涨了百分之四十。
    企业领导人不但工资高、奖金多，而且企业的所谓“福利设施”，实际上都是为一小撮特权阶层服务，为他们所占有的。特权阶层可以有几套房间，还有别墅，可以免费疗养等等，而工人住房紧张，生活困难，更谈不到享受文化福利。
    由于实行这种“新体制”，“各尽所能，按劳分配”的社会主义分配原则已完全被破坏。企业负责人、工程技术人员和高级职员同工人之间的收入差距日益扩大。一小撮特权阶层越来越富裕，而广大工人则越来越贫困。
            苏联人民强烈反对　帝国主义喝采叫好
    但是，“新体制”在推行过程中，遭到了苏联人民的强烈反对和不满。利别尔曼在一九六二年抛出这个倡议以后，就纷纷有人揭露它的全面复辟资本主义的反动实质。他们指出，如果采用这些措施，就会严重破坏国民经济的平衡，取消计划经济，丧失十月革命的社会主义成果。苏联人民愤怒地说：“现在就是卢布决定一切！”有着光荣革命斗争传统的苏联工人说得好：“什么新体制？还不是让我们工人为他们多干活！”真是一语道破了“新体制”的反动实质。
    苏修统治集团大肆推行全面复辟资本主义的“新体制”，博得了帝国主义和各国反动派的喝采叫好。美国垄断财团的喉舌《华尔街日报》兴高采烈地说：“欢迎（苏修统治集团）加入我们的俱乐部。”一些资产阶级御用学者也洋洋得意地说：“苏联回到了通过市场调节经济关系的资本主义时代”。敌人的捧场和赞美，进一步揭穿了苏修统治集团鼓吹的“新体制”与资本主义唯利是图的利润原则完全是一样的货色。
    毛主席十年前教导我们：“无产阶级必然能够战胜资产阶级，社会主义必然能够战胜资本主义，被压迫民族必然能够战胜帝国主义。当然，在人民前面还有困难和曲折。但是，列宁在三十六年前说得好，‘重要的是，坚冰已经打破，航线已经开通，道路已经指明。’”哪里有压迫和剥削，哪里就有反抗和斗争。苏修统治集团不管用什么鬼花招，用什么样的漂亮词句来装饰自己，都是欺骗不了苏联广大工农兵群众的。苏联人民决不会听任宰割，必然要起来造反，彻底砸烂苏修复辟资本主义的一切枷锁。
