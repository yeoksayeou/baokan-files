The Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party Delegation, the Asia and Pacific Peace Liaison Committee, the Indonesian Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, the Malayan National Liberation League Delegation in China, and the Lao People's National Women's Union have recently issued statements strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by the Thai Thanom puppet regime, which is a faithful henchman of U.S. imperialism, in brutally persecuting Thai patriotic revolutionaries. They expressed their resolute support for the just struggle of the Thai patriots.

In a statement issued in Beijing, the delegation of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party pointed out that the atrocities committed by the Sarit-Thanon-Baibo fascist puppet regime of U.S. imperialism are in coordination with their opposition to the peoples of neighboring countries. They collude with U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits to sabotage the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people. They assist the reactionary forces of Malaysia and Indonesia in suppressing revolutionary and progressive movements in these regions. All these crimes clearly show that the Thai puppet regime has turned Thailand into a direct military base for U.S. imperialism to oppose the People's Republic of China and the peoples of all Southeast Asian countries. However, the Thai people will never allow their homeland to be used against the peoples of other Asian countries. Under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party and the Patriotic Front, the Thai people have been waging a glorious armed struggle and have achieved one victory after another. The statement warns the Thanom-Baibo regime and their American masters: blood debts must be repaid in blood. The peoples of Southeast Asia are fighting to free themselves from the shackles, exploitation, and poverty of old and new colonialism. As Chairman Mao Zedong has said: "The world is advancing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone." The statement said that the Burmese people stand firmly with the Thai Communist Party.

In its statement, the Secretariat of the Asia and Pacific Peace Liaison Committee called on all democratic and justice-loving peoples in the Asia-Pacific region and the world to support the struggle of the Thai people against the U.S.-Thanom regime and to support the Thai people's armed revolutionary struggle against the Thai reactionaries. The statement pointed out that all revolutionary and progressive peoples must immediately rise up against U.S. imperialism and its biggest accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys and partners in various countries!

In his statement, Ibrahim Isa, General Secretary of the Indonesian Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, pointed out that the heroic patriotic people of Thailand will not be intimidated by the fascist atrocities of the Thanom-Baibo regime. They will strengthen their unity and determination to deal more effective blows to the American lackey Thanom-Baibo regime and strive to liberate their beloved country and people from brutal fascist tyranny.

The Malayan National Liberation League Delegation in China stated that the Malayan people are indignant at the fascist atrocities committed by the Thanom puppet regime against Thai patriotic democrats. The Thanom puppet regime is also the enemy of the Malayan people. All the brutal measures taken by this reactionary regime only prove one truth: the greater the oppression of the people, the stronger the people's resistance.

In its statement, the Lao People's National Women's Union pointed out that the savage actions taken by the Thanom-Baibo fascist government of Thailand under the orders of U.S. imperialism openly trample on the democratic rights and dignity of the Thai people. The statement pointed out that the entire Thai people, united around the Thai Communist Party and the Thai Patriotic Front, will certainly drive U.S. imperialism out of their beloved land.

In addition, foreign experts in Beijing and revolutionary students and youth from various countries residing in Beijing have also issued statements, expressing their determination to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to stand together with the Thai people, and to fight to the end to defeat the common enemy of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

    缅共中央代表团等强烈谴责泰国傀儡集团疯狂迫害爱国者
    泰国人民必将摧毁反动统治赶走美国强盗
    呼吁世界革命人民以实际行动支持泰国人民的革命斗争
    据新华社三十一日讯  缅共中央代表团、亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会、印尼亚非人民团结组织、马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团、老挝全国妇女联合会等最近纷纷发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的忠实走狗——泰国他侬傀儡集团疯狂迫害泰国爱国革命人士的法西斯暴行，表示坚决支持泰国爱国者的正义斗争。
    缅甸共产党中央委员会代表团在北京发表的一项声明中指出，美帝国主义的法西斯傀儡——沙立—他侬—巴博集团制造的暴行，是同他们反对邻国的人民相配合的。他们勾结美帝国主义和国民党匪徒，破坏缅甸人民的革命斗争。他们帮助马来亚和印尼反动派镇压这些地区的革命和进步运动。所有这些罪行都清楚地表明，泰国傀儡集团已经把泰国变成美帝国主义直接反对中华人民共和国和整个东南亚国家的人民的一个军事基地。但是，泰国人民决不允许自己祖国的土地被用来反对亚洲其他国家。泰国人民在泰国共产党和爱国阵线的领导下，一直在进行一场光荣的武装斗争，取得了一个又一个重大的胜利。声明警告他侬—巴博集团和他们的美国主子：血债必须用血来还。东南亚各国人民正在为摆脱新老殖民主义的束缚、剥削和贫困而斗争。正如毛泽东主席说过的：“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”声明说，缅甸人民坚决站在泰国共产党一边。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平联络委员会秘书处在声明中呼吁亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界一切民主和爱好正义的人民，以实际行动支持泰国人民反对美国—他侬集团的斗争，支持泰国人民反对泰国反动派的革命武装斗争。声明指出，一切革命和进步人民必须立即起来反对美帝国主义和它的最大帮凶苏联现代修正主义及他们在各国的一切走狗和合伙者！
    印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织总书记易卜拉欣·伊萨在声明中指出，泰国的英雄爱国人民决不会被他侬—巴博集团的法西斯暴行所吓倒，他们将加强团结与决心，给予美国走狗他侬—巴博集团以更加卓有成效的打击，争取自己所热爱的祖国和人民从残暴的法西斯专制下解放出来。
    马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团声明说，马来亚人民对卖国的他侬法西斯集团对泰国爱国民主人士犯下的法西斯暴行感到愤怒。他侬傀儡集团也是马来亚人民的敌人。这个反动集团采取的一切残暴措施只证明了这样一个真理：对人民的压迫愈大，人民的反抗愈强烈。
    老挝全国妇女联合会在声明中指出，泰国他侬—巴博法西斯政府在美帝国主义指使下所采取的野蛮行动，公开地践踏了泰国人民的民主权利和尊严。声明指出，团结在泰国共产党和泰国爱国阵线周围的全体泰国人民，一定能把美帝国主义从自己可爱的国土上赶出去。
    此外，在北京的外国专家和居住在北京的来自各国的革命学生和青年也分别发表声明，表示要高举毛泽东思想红旗，同泰国人民团结在一起，下定决心，为打败共同的敌人美帝、苏修、各国反动派而战斗到底。
