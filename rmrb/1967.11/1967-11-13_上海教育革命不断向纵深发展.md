The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian education revolution have greatly inspired and mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in Shanghai. A mighty storm of educational revolution is rising in Shanghai, and the situation is excellent and getting better and better.

After the publication of the editorial "All Schools, Big, Medium, and Small, Should Resume Classes and Make Revolution" in the *People's Daily* in late October, Shanghai's primary, secondary, and higher education institutions immediately launched a high tide of resuming classes and making revolution. By the end of October, primary schools had basically all resumed classes, and secondary and higher education institutions were gradually resuming classes. Primary and secondary schools also enrolled new students. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff are teaching while reforming, and the revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of various schools are continuously deepening. On November 3, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian education revolution and the preliminary plans for educational revolution from Tongji University and other schools were published, further pointing out the path for Shanghai's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to resume classes, make revolution, and deeply carry out the educational revolution. A storm of educational revolution, with the central task of thoroughly destroying the old educational system and establishing a proletarian educational system, quickly and vigorously developed across Shanghai. Now, there are already advanced units in the educational revolution such as Tongji University, East China Normal University, Kongjiang Middle School, and the Third Central Primary School in Zhabei District, and many more schools are catching up and striving to keep up. Preliminary plans for educational revolution in various primary, secondary, and higher education institutions, as well as in science, engineering, liberal arts, and medical fields, have been proposed based on criticism, investigation, and practice.

The most prominent feature of the current excellent situation in Shanghai's educational front is that the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have been more widely and deeply mobilized. Walking into the schools, one can see big-character posters related to the educational revolution everywhere and hear heated discussions. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and the Red Guards are fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line represented by Liu Shaoqi, strongly denouncing the oppression of the old educational system on them, and angrily condemning the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the schools. They seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution, full of spirit and fighting spirit, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, and feel extremely honored and proud to establish a proletarian educational system in their generation.

In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, how to deeply carry out the educational revolution? The proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff on Shanghai's educational front have mainly focused on the following aspects and have gained some preliminary experience:

Fiercely Criticize the Counter-Revolutionary Revisionist Educational Line

Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the old educational system, and thoroughly smash the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the schools, this is an important task for carrying out the educational revolution at present. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." Without thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the old educational system, it is impossible to draw clear political, ideological, and theoretical lines between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the educational front, and it is impossible to grasp the key and essence of the old educational system to criticize and reform it. The reason why Tongji University can propose the preliminary plan for the educational revolution of the "May 7th Commune" and why some schools like Kongjiang Middle School can take a step forward on the path of educational revolution is that the revolutionary teachers and students in these schools have carried out a relatively in-depth criticism of the old educational system.

Currently, the criticism of the revisionist educational line and the old educational system on Shanghai's educational front is continuously deepening. Through the criticism, the cover of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the educational front has been further lifted, the poison of the revisionist educational line has been cleared, the class consciousness of the masses has been raised, and the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have further understood and mastered Chairman Mao's educational thoughts and the proletarian educational line. This has laid a solid ideological foundation for thoroughly reforming the old educational system, educational policies, and methods.

Fully Mobilize the Masses to Fight a People's War

To carry out the educational revolution well, we must rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and fight a people's war. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." The preliminary ideas for educational reform proposed by Shanghai's primary, secondary, and higher education institutions are all the crystallizations of the collective wisdom of the masses.

Currently, the vast majority of teachers, students, and staff on Shanghai's educational front have thrown themselves into this great struggle of educational revolution. East China Normal University has held five school-wide debates on educational reform, with thousands of people participating in each. Tongji University, Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School, Kongjiang Middle School, and many other schools frequently exchange experiences and study problems in the educational revolution. The relevant departments of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee recently held experience-sharing meetings on educational revolution in some pioneering primary, secondary, and higher education institutions, promoting the development of the educational revolution.

Reform Teaching in Combination with Teaching Practice

Reforming teaching must be combined with teaching practice, adhering to the principle of teaching while reforming. This is another experience of the proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's educational front in the educational revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "...If you want knowledge, you must take part in the practical struggle to change reality. If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear and taste it yourself." Various plans for educational reform can only be tested in teaching practice, through the discussion and criticism of the masses, to see if they are correct or wrong.

Based on the principle of teaching while reforming, the primary, secondary, and higher education institutions that have resumed classes use either newly compiled textbooks or the original teaching materials; some use teachers lecturing, while others adopt the method of classroom discussion and criticism between teachers and students. The preliminary plans for educational revolution that have been proposed are also being actively arranged and organized for revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to practice. In addition, many schools have planned, step-by-step, and led some revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to conduct investigations among the workers and peasants to provide a basis for the educational revolution.

Continuously Consolidate and Develop Revolutionary Great Unity and Revolutionary Three-in-One Combination

The practical experience of the educational revolution on Shanghai's educational front shows: revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination are necessary conditions and important guarantees for carrying out the educational revolution. In Shanghai, schools where the educational revolution is relatively well done have relatively solid revolutionary great unity and relatively good revolutionary three-in-one combination. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands and millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." In a school, if revolutionary great unity is not achieved, the thoughts of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff cannot be unified, and their steps cannot be consistent; if the revolutionary three-in-one combination is not done well, the educational revolution cannot be carried out in an organized and sustained manner.

Currently, Shanghai's primary, secondary, and higher education institutions have basically achieved revolutionary great unity. Ten districts and one county have established unified organizations for the Red Guards, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Red Guards in universities is about to convene. A considerable number of primary, secondary, and higher education institutions have established revolutionary committees. Recently, revolutionary teachers and students in many schools have been following Chairman Mao's latest instructions from his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China regions, and following Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, correctly treating cadres, helping cadres return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and speeding up the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism

Chairman Mao teaches us: we must fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. The broad proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's educational front deeply feel in the educational revolution that "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is not only the fundamental guideline for carrying out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat but also the fundamental guideline for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. Carrying out the proletarian educational revolution will not only encounter the fierce resistance of the bourgeoisie, requiring us to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against them; it will also cause a fierce struggle between the two thoughts in our own minds. Vice Chairman Lin points out: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." Only by well changing our subjective world in the educational revolution and using Mao Zedong Thought to change and arm ourselves can we carry out the educational revolution well.

Now, a more in-depth and extensive movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is rising on Shanghai's educational front. Daily reading of the "Old Three Articles" and studying Chairman Mao's works for two hours a day have become a system in most schools.

Shanghai Tongji University's revolutionary young fighters from the Bridge Engineering Department, Class 3, are discussing the reform of the teaching plan.

    用毛泽东思想狠批反革命修正主义教育路线
    上海教育革命不断向纵深发展
    革命师生员工认真学习和贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示
    据新华社上海十二日电　本社记者述评：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，极大地鼓舞和调动了上海广大革命学生、革命教员和革命工人的革命积极性和创造性。一个声势浩大的教育革命风暴正在上海兴起，形势一片大好，而且越来越好。
    十月下旬，《人民日报》《大、中、小学校都要复课闹革命》的社论发表以后，上海的大、中、小学立即掀起了复课闹革命的高潮。到十月底止，小学基本上已全部复课，大、中学校也陆续复课。中、小学还招收了新生。广大革命师生员工一边教学，一边改革，革命的大批判和各学校的斗批改，不断向纵深发展。十一月三日，毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示和同济大学等学校关于教育革命的初步方案的发表，向上海革命的师生员工进一步指明了复课闹革命，深入开展教育革命的前进道路，一个以彻底摧毁旧的教育制度、创建无产阶级教育制度为中心内容的教育革命风暴，便迅速在上海全市蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。现在，已经涌现出同济大学、华东师范大学、控江中学、闸北区第三中心小学等一批教育革命的先进单位，还有更多的学校正在急起直追，迎头赶上。一个个大、中、小学的，工科、理科、文科、医科的教育革命方案，在大批判、调查研究和实践的基础上提出来了。
    当前上海教育战线大好形势最显著的特点是，广大革命师生员工已经更广泛、更深入地发动起来。走进学校，到处可以看到有关教育革命的大字报，可以听到热烈的讨论。广大革命师生员工、红卫兵小将，狠批以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义教育路线，强烈控诉旧教育制度对他们的迫害，愤怒声讨资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。他们认真学习毛主席有关教育革命的指示，意气风发、斗志昂扬地争当决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，并且对将在自己这一代手中创建无产阶级的教育制度感到无比光荣和自豪。
    在复课闹革命中，如何深入开展教育革命？上海教育战线的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和革命师生员工主要抓了以下几个环节，摸索出以下的初步经验：
    狠批反革命修正主义教育路线
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠批反革命修正主义教育路线，大破旧的教育制度，大破资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治，这是当前搞好教育革命的重要任务。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”不对反革命修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度进行彻底批判，就不可能从政治上、思想上、理论上划清教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的界限，就不可能抓住旧的教育制度的关键和要害，针锋相对地进行批判，进行改革。同济大学之所以能提出“五·七”公社教育革命的初步方案，控江中学等一些学校之所以能在教育革命的前进道路上迈出一步，就是因为这些学校的革命师生对旧的教育制度进行了比较深入的批判。
    现在，上海市教育战线对修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度的大批判，正在不断地向纵深发展。通过大批判，进一步揭开了教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，清除着修正主义教育路线的流毒，提高了广大群众的阶级觉悟，同时也使广大革命师生员工进一步领会和掌握毛主席的教育思想和无产阶级的教育路线，这就为彻底改革旧的教育制度，改革旧的教育方针和方法，打下了坚实的思想基础。
    充分发动群众打一场人民战争
    要搞好教育革命，必须依靠群众，充分发动群众，打一场人民战争。毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”上海大、中、小学提出的一些教改初步设想，无一不是群众集体智慧的结晶。
    目前，上海教育战线上绝大部分师生员工，都投身到了教育革命这场伟大的斗争中来。华东师范大学先后举行了五次全校性的大辩论来讨论教改问题，每次都有几千人参加。同济大学、市六女中、控江中学等很多学校，还经常相互交流经验，研究教育革命中的问题。上海市革命委员会有关部门，最近分别在一些先行的大、中学校召开了教育革命现场经验交流会，推动教育革命的发展。
    改革教学同教学实践相结合
    改革教学，必须同教学实践相结合，坚持一边进行教学，一边进行改革。这是上海教育战线上的无产阶级革命派在教育革命中的又一个体会。毛主席教导我们：“……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”教育改革的各种方案，只有在教学的实践中，经过群众的讨论、批判，才能检验出它是正确的还是错误的。
    根据一边教学、一边改革的原则，开学复课的大、中、小学，有的是用新编的课本，有的仍用原有的教材；有的是由教师讲课，有的采用课堂师生共同讨论、批判的方法。已经提出的一些教育革命的初步方案，也正在积极安排，组织革命师生员工进行实践。此外，许多学校还有计划、有步骤、有领导地组织了一些革命师生员工，到工农群众中去进行调查，为教育革命提供依据。
    不断巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合
    上海教育战线教育革命的实践经验表明：革命的大联合和革命的三结合是开展教育革命的必要条件和重要保证。在上海，凡是教育革命搞得比较好的学校，革命大联合都比较巩固，革命的三结合也搞得比较好。毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”在一个学校里，如果没有实现革命的大联合，革命师生员工的思想就不可能统一，步调就不可能一致；如果没有搞好革命的三结合，教育革命就不可能有领导有组织地、深入持久地开展下去。
    目前，上海大、中、小学都已经基本上实现了革命的大联合，中学已有十个区、一个县成立了红卫兵的统一组织，大学红代会也即将召开。相当一批大、中、小学建立了革命委员会。最近，许多学校的革命师生，正遵照毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的最新指示，遵照毛主席的干部政策，正确地对待干部，帮助干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来，加速实现革命的三结合。
    以“斗私，批修”为纲
    毛主席教导我们：要斗私，批修。上海教育战线广大无产阶级革命派在教育革命中深深感到，“斗私，批修”不仅是进行无产阶级文化大革命的根本纲领，更是进行无产阶级教育革命的根本纲领。进行无产阶级教育革命，不仅会遇到资产阶级的疯狂反抗，需要我们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去同他们进行斗争；而且在我们自己头脑里也会引起两种思想的激烈斗争。林副统帅指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”只有在教育革命中很好地改造自己的主观世界，用毛泽东思想改造和武装我们自己，才能搞好教育革命。
    现在，一个更加深入、更加广泛的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，正在上海教育战线兴起。天天读“老三篇”，每天学习毛主席著作两小时，在大部分学校都已成为制度。（附图片）
