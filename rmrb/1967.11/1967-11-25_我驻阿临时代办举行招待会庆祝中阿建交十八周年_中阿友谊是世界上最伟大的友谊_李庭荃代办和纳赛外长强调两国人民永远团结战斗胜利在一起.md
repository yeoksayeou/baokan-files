Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Hosts Reception to Celebrate the 18th Anniversary of Sino-Albanian Diplomatic Relations

Sino-Albanian Friendship is the Greatest Friendship in the World

Li Tingqian, Chargé d'Affaires, and Foreign Minister Nasi Emphasize that the Peoples of the Two Countries Will Forever Stand Together in Unity, Struggle, and Victory

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 24 - On the evening of the 23rd, Li Tingqian, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, hosted a reception to enthusiastically celebrate the 18th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Albania.

	Attendees included: Albanian Foreign Minister Nasi, Minister of Culture and Education Dajana, Deputy Minister of Trade Kati, Chairman of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee Treska, and representatives from various sectors.

	At the reception, filled with revolutionary friendship and combative unity, Li Tingqian, Chargé d'Affaires, and Foreign Minister Nasi both delivered speeches.

	Li Tingqian stated in his speech that the Sino-Albanian friendship, personally forged by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. Over the 18 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the comprehensive friendly and mutually supportive cooperative relationship between our two countries has continued to develop and strengthen.

	He said that the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian government, and the Albanian people have wholeheartedly supported and highly praised our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically endorsed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and vehemently denounced the slanders by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries against our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has been a great encouragement and inspiration to our revolutionary people who are in the midst of a revolutionary high tide.

	Li Tingqian pointed out that the friendship and unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania have been continuously strengthened, which is of great significance in promoting the development of Marxist-Leninist forces in various countries, striving for greater victories in the international proletarian revolutionary cause, and the struggle of the world's people against imperialism and revisionism. All revolutionary people around the world are jubilant about this.

	Li Tingqian said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The great revolutionary transformation led by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has also achieved tremendous successes. This is a common victory for the two parties and peoples of China and Albania, and for all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world.

	Nasi, in his speech, pointed out that over the past 18 years, the friendly relations and fraternal cooperation between the Albanian people and the Chinese people have been continuously strengthened and developed in all aspects. This great friendship, based on the principles of proletarian Marxism-Leninism, has been tempered in the fiery struggle for the construction of socialism and against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist renegade clique.

	Nasi said that the Albanian Labor Party and our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha have deeply rooted in the hearts of the Albanian people the boundless love for the great seven hundred million Chinese people, for the glorious Communist Party of China, and for its great leader, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. The recent visit to the People's Republic of China by the Albanian party and government delegation led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu vividly embodies the great friendship between our two brotherly peoples. He pointed out that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is another great victory of great historical significance for the Chinese people and Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only of great significance to the fate of socialism and revolution in China but also of great significance to the fate of socialism and revolution in the world. This revolution has dashed to pieces the hopes of the American imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists to overthrow socialism and restore capitalism in China through a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power in China led by China's Khrushchev.

	Li Tingqian, Chargé d'Affaires, and Foreign Minister Nasi both expressed in their speeches that the peoples of China and Albania will, following the teachings of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, forever stand together in unity, struggle, and victory.

	During the reception, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted to the revolutionary and combative friendship between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, as well as to the health of the great creators of this friendship, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

    我驻阿临时代办举行招待会庆祝中阿建交十八周年
    中阿友谊是世界上最伟大的友谊
    李庭荃代办和纳赛外长强调两国人民永远团结战斗胜利在一起
    据新华社地拉那二十四日电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办李庭荃二十三日晚上举行招待会，热烈庆祝中国和阿尔巴尼亚建交十八周年。
    出席招待会的有：阿尔巴尼亚外交部长纳赛、文化教育部长德雅纳、贸易部副部长卡蒂、对外文化联络委员会主席特雷斯卡和各界人士。
    在充满着革命友谊和战斗团结气氛的招待会上，李庭荃临时代办和纳赛外长先后讲了话。
    李庭荃在讲话中指出，由中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志亲手缔造的、建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的中阿友谊，是世界上最伟大最珍贵的友谊。中阿建交十八年来，我们两国之间的全面的友好互助合作关系不断得到发展和巩固。
    他说，以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民，全力支持和高度评价我国无产阶级文化大革命，热情地赞扬毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，痛斥帝修反对我国无产阶级文化大革命的污蔑，这是对正处在革命高潮中的我国革命人民极大的支持和鼓舞。
    李庭荃指出，中阿两党、两国和两国人民的友谊和团结不断加强，对于促进世界各国马克思列宁主义力量的发展，争取国际无产阶级革命事业和世界人民反帝反修斗争的更大胜利，具有极其重大的意义。全世界革命人民为此感到欢欣鼓舞。
    李庭荃说，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的具有伟大历史意义的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，已取得了决定性胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志领导的伟大的革命化运动，已取得了巨大成就。这是中阿两党和两国人民，全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的共同胜利。
    纳赛在讲话中指出，十八年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友好关系和兄弟般合作，在各方面都不断得到巩固和发展。这种建立在无产阶级马克思列宁主义原则基础上的伟大友谊，是我们两个马克思列宁主义政党和我们亲爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志在为建设社会主义和反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争烈火中锤炼起来的。
    纳赛说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和我们亲爱的领袖霍查同志，把对伟大七亿中国人民、对光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的无比热爱的感情，深深地扎根在阿尔巴尼亚人民的心坎里。由部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团最近对中华人民共和国的访问，生动地体现了存在于我们两国兄弟人民之间的伟大友谊。他指出，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是中国人民和毛泽东同志马克思列宁主义思想具有重大历史意义的又一个伟大的胜利。无产阶级文化大革命不仅对中国的社会主义和革命的命运有着十分重大的意义，而且对全世界的社会主义和革命的命运也有着十分重大的意义。这场革命使美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图通过以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在中国推翻社会主义和复辟资本主义的希望化为灰烬。
    李庭荃临时代办和纳赛外长在讲话中都表示，中阿两国人民将遵照毛主席和霍查同志的教导，永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    招待会上，宾主不断为中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的革命的战斗的友谊及其伟大的缔造者毛泽东同志和霍查同志的健康频频干杯。
