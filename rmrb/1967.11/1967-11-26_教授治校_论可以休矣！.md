Title: The "Professor-Run School" Theory Can Be Laid to Rest!

The old Beijing University was a typical example of a school ruled by bourgeois intellectuals. Under the control of the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev, bourgeois intellectuals usurped the leadership of the school and department levels, implementing bourgeois dictatorship.

The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, in order to maintain the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over schools, advocated the right-wing "professor-run school" theory, attempting to achieve the goal of restoring capitalism and creating various fallacies.

First, they say: "Intellectual laborers are also part of the working class."

China's Khrushchev blatantly said at a symposium attended mostly by bourgeois intellectuals: "All kinds of different forms of selling labor power are part of the working class... Intellectual laborers are also part of the working class. The working class is determined to be the leading class, and most of you here are included." When revolutionary masses use Mao Zedong Thought to insist on class analysis of intellectuals, China's Khrushchev boosts the morale of bourgeois intellectuals by saying: "What do intellectuals do? They serve others. The landlords and capitalists are gone, so aren't you serving the workers and peasants?" The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi was even more blunt: "Changing the bourgeois worldview is a thing of the past or will soon be a thing of the past." He also harshly rebuked revolutionary cadres, saying: "Talking about bourgeois intellectuals, talking about bourgeois intellectuals, is unacceptable." This is a blatant opposition to Chairman Mao's views on class and class struggle.

Chairman Mao pointed out ten years ago: "Most of our intellectuals today come from the old society and are from non-laboring people's families. Even if some come from working-class or peasant families, they received bourgeois education before liberation, and their worldview is basically bourgeois; they are still bourgeois intellectuals." Chairman Mao also pointed out the extreme reactionary nature of the right-wing among bourgeois intellectuals, saying: "Such people do not like our proletarian dictatorship state; they yearn for the old society. At any opportunity, they will stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has exposed the reactionary essence of the "intellectual laborers are also part of the working class" advocated by China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi!

Second, they say: "The proletariat should learn from the bourgeoisie."

The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road praise bourgeois "scholarship" as if it were divine, while at the same time vilifying the proletariat. China's Khrushchev openly proposed: "The proletariat should learn from the bourgeoisie, acknowledging that the latter's cultural and technological level is higher than the former's." Lu Dingyi was even more obsequious: "Without the bourgeoisie, who will teach us?" Regarding Feng Youlan, the notorious bourgeois reactionary academic "authority," Lu Dingyi shamelessly praised him, saying: "I read Feng Youlan's book, and he is indeed more brilliant than us." He also openly advocated: "In schools, Marxism-Leninism should be studied, and Confucius' feudalism and capitalism should also be studied." This is thoroughgoing class capitulationism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." The argument that does not analyze scholarship from a class perspective is completely wrong. The truth that the proletariat has grasped in scholarship, the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, has long since surpassed and overwhelmed the bourgeoisie.

Third, they say: "Technology, the party cannot lead."

This is a common "trick" used by right-wing bourgeois elements to oppose proletarian dictatorship, which has long been exposed by the revolutionary masses. However, China's Khrushchev, using a roundabout and obscure language, has once again raised this "trick." Just as the educational revolution from 1958 to 1960 made the ruling position of bourgeois intellectuals in our schools shaky, he jumped out and said: "Currently, in higher schools, the system of the party committee leading and the president heading the school administration committee should be implemented, fully utilizing the role of the president, the school administration committee, and various administrative organizations." Who can be the president? Who can be on the school administration committee? Lu Dingyi explained: "Technology, the party cannot lead." "Small intellectuals leading big intellectuals, in any case, is not acceptable." "Outsiders cannot lead insiders." In 1961, Lu Dingyi openly invited anti-communist veterans like Jian Bozan and said: "All organizations should be led by party members, I disagree, today I invite you to be the president." He also clearly said: "Department heads and presidents have power." Lu Ping then pulled a large number of bourgeois intellectuals, even bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," into the school administration committee. Since then, the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools has become even more serious.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "Without the efforts of the Communist Party of China, without the Communist Party members being the backbone of the Chinese people, China's independence and liberation would be impossible, and China's industrialization and modernization of agriculture would also be impossible." The proletarian party must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything and command everything. It is clear that Lu Dingyi's proposition of "technology, the party cannot lead" is a fallacy against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, our great leader Chairman Mao is leading us, the millions of cultural revolutionaries of the proletariat, to smash the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over our schools. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" and thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and eliminate its poisonous influence.

    “教授治校”论可以休矣！
    北京大学文革《教学批判》编辑组
    旧北京大学是一个资产阶级知识分子统治学校的典型。在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的控制下，资产阶级知识分子窃踞了校、系各级领导大权，实行资产阶级专政。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了维护资产阶级知识分子统治学校，实行资产阶级右派“教授治校”的主张，妄图达到复辟资本主义的目的，制造了种种谬论。
    一曰：“脑力劳动者也是工人阶级的一部分。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫在一次大多数是资产阶级知识分子的教育工作者座谈会上露骨地说：“各种不同形式的出卖劳动力，都是工人阶级，……脑力劳动者也是工人阶级的一部分。确定工人阶级为领导阶级，在座诸位大多数在内。”当革命群众运用毛泽东思想坚持对知识分子进行阶级分析时，中国赫鲁晓夫为资产阶级知识分子打气说：“知识分子是干什么的呢？是为别人服务的。地主资本家没有了，你们难道不是就是为工农服务吗？”反革命修正主义分子陆定一更露骨地说：改造资产阶级世界观，“是过去的事或者将要过去的事了”。他还恶狠狠地训斥广大革命干部说：“开口资产阶级知识分子，闭口资产阶级知识分子，要不得。”这是公然反对毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的观点。
    毛主席在十年前就曾经指出：“我们现在的大多数的知识分子，是从旧社会过来的，是从非劳动人民家庭出身的。有些人即使是出身于工人农民的家庭，但是在解放以前受的是资产阶级教育，世界观基本上是资产阶级的，他们还是属于资产阶级的知识分子。”毛主席还指出了资产阶级知识分子中的右翼的极端反动性，他说：“这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”毛泽东思想的光辉把中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流鼓吹的“脑力劳动者也是工人阶级的一部分”的反动实质暴露于光天化日之下了！
    二曰：“无产阶级要向资产阶级学习。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把资产阶级的“学术”吹得神乎其神，同时又极力丑化无产阶级。中国赫鲁晓夫公然提出：
  “无产阶级要向资产阶级学习，承认后者的文化技术水平比前者高。”陆定一则说得更肉麻了：“离开资产阶级还有谁来教我们？”对于冯友兰这个臭名昭著的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，陆定一竟无耻地吹捧说：“我看了冯友兰的书，他的确比我们高明些。”他还公然主张“在学校里，马列主义要搞，孔夫子封建主义的、资本主义的东西也要搞”。这是彻头彻尾的阶级投降主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”那种对学术不作阶级分析的论调是完全错误的。无产阶级在学术上所掌握的真理，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理，早已大大地超过了和压倒了资产阶级。
    三曰：“技术，党不能领导。”
    这是资产阶级右派分子反对无产阶级专政常用的“法宝”，早已为广大革命群众识破了。而中国赫鲁晓夫却以一种曲折隐晦的语言，重新祭起了这一“法宝”。正当一九五八年至一九六○年的教育革命使得资产阶级知识分子对我们学校的统治地位摇摇欲坠的时候，他跳了出来说：“目前在高等学校中要实行党委领导下的以校长为首的校务委员会负责制，充分发挥校长、校务委员会和各级行政组织的作用。”什么人可以当校长？什么人可以当校务委员？陆定一作了解释：“技术，党不能领导。”“小知识分子领导大知识分子，无论如何是不行的。”“外行不能领导内行。”一九六一年，陆定一公然把反共老手翦伯赞等找去说：“一切组织都由党员来领导，我不同意，今天就请你们来当校长。”他还明确说：“系主任、校长是有权的。”陆平紧接着把一大批资产阶级知识分子、甚至资产阶级反动学术“权威”拉入了校务委员会。从此资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象更加严重了。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”“没有中国共产党的努力，没有中国共产党人做中国人民的中流砥柱，中国的独立和解放是不可能的，中国的工业化和农业近代化也是不可能的。”无产阶级政党就是要用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想领导一切，统帅一切。很清楚，陆定一提出的“技术，党不能领导”，是反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的谬论。
    今天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席率领着我们千百万无产阶级文化革命大军，摧毁了资产阶级知识分子对我们学校的统治。我们要坚决响应毛主席关于“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，彻底批判反革命修正主义教育路线，并肃清其流毒。
