The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has tempered a new generation, and a large number of revolutionary young people have been promoted to leadership positions. Our proletarian revolutionary cause has such a reliable group of successors, which is truly exciting!

Our factory's revolutionary committee has 21 members. Apart from five old cadres, most are revolutionary workers who have grown and been tempered during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Although some people sneer at them behind their backs, saying they "can't accomplish much," practice has proven that they have wisdom, courage, and ability. They have authority among the masses and can quickly learn what they don't know, managing socialist enterprises well. What is particularly worth learning from by us old cadres is that they have deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They always study Chairman Mao's instructions repeatedly, understand them deeply, and carry them out resolutely.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are a decisive factor. Therefore, it is our battle task to cultivate a large number of new cadres in a planned way." New cadres have many advantages, but they lack experience and are not yet politically mature. In their work, they inevitably make some mistakes and errors. This requires us old cadres to timely and enthusiastically help them improve their political level and work ability, help them summarize experiences and lessons, and solve practical difficulties.

In the early days of our taking power, some new cadres, due to lack of experience, were busy with administrative work and relaxed their leadership over the revolutionary criticism. In response to this situation, we studied Chairman Mao's works with the new cadres, especially repeatedly studied "The Working Method of the Party Committee." They understood that work should have a focus and also take care of the whole, so they concentrated their main forces and quickly carried out the revolutionary criticism. Some new cadres, after taking power, showed signs of alienation from the masses. We considered this a serious problem and studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line with them, inspiring them not to alienate themselves from the masses. This helped the new cadres mature politically and become people's servants who are always enthusiastic and never alienate themselves from the masses.

In the future, apart from frequently introducing our work experience and lessons from mistakes to them, it is more important to persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the new cadres. In the struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, we will cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." Currently, in our factory, new and old cadres respect each other and oppose unprincipled compromise; they cooperate closely and do not reconcile differences. A lively atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness has emerged between all the new and old cadres in the factory. Such an atmosphere is very beneficial for seizing the revolution and promoting production. Now, our factory's revolution is booming, and production is exceeding the plan every month.

    新老干部并肩战斗
    山东造纸总厂东厂革命委员会副主任委员、原党委副书记　姜作周
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，锻炼了一代新人，大批革命小将被提拔到领导岗位上来。我们的无产阶级革命事业有了这样一大批可靠的接班人，真是令人兴奋！
    我厂革命委员会有二十一名委员，除五个老干部外，大多数是这次无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼成长起来的革命工人。虽然有人在背后讥笑他们“成不了什么大事”，但是实践证明，他们有智慧，有魄力，有才干，在群众中有威信，完全能够很快学会自己不懂的东西，管好社会主义企业。特别值得我们老干部学习的是，他们对伟大领袖毛主席、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有深厚的阶级感情。他们对于毛主席的指示，总是反复学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。因此，有计划地培养大批的新干部，就是我们的战斗任务。”新干部有很多优点，但是，他们经验不足，政治上也还不成熟，工作中难免出现一些缺点和错误。这就需要我们老干部及时地热情地帮助他们提高政治水平和工作能力，帮助他们总结经验教训，解决实际困难。
    我们掌权的初期，少数新干部由于没有经验，忙于事务性工作，放松了对革命大批判的领导。针对这种情况，我们和新干部一起学习毛主席著作，特别是反复学习了《党委会的工作方法》。他们懂得了做工作，既要有重点，又要兼顾全面，于是集中主要力量，很快把革命大批判搞了起来。还有少数新干部掌权以后，有脱离群众的现象，我们认为这是个严重问题，就和他们一起学习毛主席关于群众路线的教导，启发他们不要脱离群众。这样使新干部在政治上尽快地成熟起来，做一个永远干劲十足，永远不脱离群众的人民的勤务员。
    今后，我们除了把自己的工作经验和犯错误的教训，经常给他们介绍以外，更重要的是要和新干部一起坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的过程中，培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”目前，我厂新老干部之间，既互相尊重，又反对无原则的迁就；既密切合作，又不调和折衷。全厂新老干部之间出现了团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的生动局面。这样一种局面，很有利于抓革命，促生产。现在，我们厂革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产也月月超额完成计划。
