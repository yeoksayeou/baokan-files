In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the editorial departments of *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* published the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Hongjin Brigade of Taicang County, Jiangsu, listened to the broadcast of this important article with great excitement during their intense autumn harvest and planting battles. Many poor and lower-middle peasants discussed it in the fields, and some held discussion meetings. They enthusiastically hailed the publication of this important article. They repeatedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

Met A'tao, an active learner and applier of Chairman Mao's works, said excitedly: "This article points out the direction for us to achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside. It thoroughly exposes the long-standing counter-revolutionary plot of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism in the countryside, and is a heavy artillery shell aimed at the vitals of this number one capitalist roader. Met A'tao angrily said, China's Khrushchev never forgets to restore capitalism and wants to push us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the pit of oppression and exploitation. He is the patron of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and the number one enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and resolutely take the socialist road. We will definitely use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror to expose the old counter-revolutionary China's Khrushchev completely. At present, we must focus on local conditions, further carry out revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose his various reactionary fallacies of restoring capitalism in the countryside, eliminate his influence, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Brigade Party Secretary Yang Mingeng said, the "three freedoms and one contract" black wind blown by China's Khrushchev also reached our Hongjin Brigade. At that time, the class enemies were very happy and spread it everywhere; the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were very angry, and we cadres strongly opposed it. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we firmly resisted this black wind. If we had followed the black wind of China's Khrushchev, capitalism would have really been restored, and the ghosts and snakes would have really come to power. How could we have the thriving socialist society we have today? How could we have the dictatorship of the proletariat? We must always remember the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Production Brigade Director Sun Xiaoguan said at the discussion meeting, China's Khrushchev fiercely blew the wind of individual farming, and some production teams were affected for a while, resulting in the obstruction of the development of collective economy. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely repelled this black wind and resolutely did not take this dead end. Chairman Mao teaches us: "As for agriculture, the socialist road is the only road for China's agriculture." We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, and make the collective economy of the people's commune better and better, with production developing year by year, truly like sesame flowers blooming higher and higher. This year, for more than a hundred days, there was no rain. If it were individual farming, the tragic scene of begging for food in the old society would come again. But, relying on the superior nature of the people's commune, riding the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and with the joint efforts of the broad masses of commune members and cadres, we finally overcame the severe disaster, and both cotton and rice achieved a bumper harvest.

Deputy Director of the Brigade Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Cultural Revolution Committee Wen Zhongying and Shen Xuelin said at the discussion meeting: The article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside" is the battle cry for mobilizing five hundred million peasants to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. We support it one thousand times and will carry it out ten thousand times! We must mobilize the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to seriously study this important article, take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and continue to carry out the struggle of "criticizing self and criticizing revisionism" extensively and deeply, launching a new high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside, fiercely fighting against the "self" in our minds, and fiercely criticizing the reactionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev and his local agents, thoroughly eliminating all their influences. We must further consolidate and develop the collective economy of the people's commune, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the socialist revolution in the countryside to the end.

    社会主义道路是我国农业唯一的道路
    洪泾大队贫农下中农座谈《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》发表了。江苏太仓县洪泾大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，在紧张的秋收秋种战斗中，以万分兴奋的心情，一次又一次地收听了广播。许多贫下中农在田头纷纷展开了议论，有些贫下中农和干部举行了座谈。他们热烈欢呼这篇重要文章的发表。他们一次又一次地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    活学活用毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃激动地说：“这篇文章给我们指明了夺取农村无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的方向。它彻底戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来妄图在农村复辟资本主义的反革命阴谋，是打中这个头号走资派要害的一颗重型炮弹。”顾阿桃愤怒地说，中国赫鲁晓夫念念不忘的就是要复辟资本主义，妄想把我们贫下中农重新推入受压迫受剥削的火坑里。他是地、富、反、坏分子的总后台，是我们贫下中农的头号死对头。我们贫下中农坚决听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义道路。我们一定用战无不胜的毛泽东思想这面照妖镜，叫老反革命中国赫鲁晓夫彻底现出原形。当前，我们要着重联系本地实际，进一步开展革命的大批判，彻底批倒批臭他在农村复辟资本主义的种种反动谬论，肃清其流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    大队党支部书记杨民生说，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起的“三自一包”黑风，也刮到了我们洪泾大队。当时，阶级敌人十分高兴，到处宣扬；广大贫下中农听了十分恼火，我们干部也非常反对。我们在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，坚决顶住了这股黑风。如果跟着中国赫鲁晓夫的黑风跑，那资本主义就会真的复辟，牛鬼蛇神就会真的上台。哪还会有我们今天欣欣向荣的社会主义？哪还会有无产阶级专政？我们要念念不忘农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的流毒。
    生产大队长孙小观在座谈会上说，中国赫鲁晓夫猖狂地大刮单干风，有的生产队一度受了影响，结果集体经济的发展遭到了阻挠。广大贫下中农坚决打退了这股黑风，坚决不走这条死路。毛主席教导我们：“就农业来说，社会主义的道路是我国农业唯一的道路。”我们坚决听毛主席的话，把人民公社的集体经济越办越好，生产一年比一年发展，真象芝麻开花节节高。今年一百多天没有下雨，如果是单干，旧社会逃荒要饭的悲惨光景又临到我们头上。但是，我们依靠人民公社的无比优越性，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，在广大社员、干部的共同努力下，终于战胜了特大的灾害，棉花和水稻都获得了大丰收。
    大队贫下中农文化革命委员会副主任闻忠英、沈雪林在座谈会上说：《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章，是发动五亿农民彻底摧毁中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的进军号。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办！一定要发动广大贫下中农和革命干部认真学习这篇重要文章，以毛泽东思想为武器，坚持毛主席的革命路线，继续广泛深入地开展“斗私，批修”，掀起农村无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮，狠斗自己头脑里的私字，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和他在本地代理人的反动谬论，彻底肃清他们的一切流毒。我们要进一步巩固和发展人民公社集体经济，巩固无产阶级专政，把农村社会主义革命进行到底。
