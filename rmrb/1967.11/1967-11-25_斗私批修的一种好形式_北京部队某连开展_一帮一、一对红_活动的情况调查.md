In early 1963, a certain platoon in the Beijing Military Region, in order to further implement the principles of "Four Firsts" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao and the directives for creating exemplary platoons and five-good soldiers, launched the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity.

"One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" means that within the squad, five-good soldiers and non-five-good soldiers, party members and non-party members, old soldiers and new soldiers, voluntarily pair up, study Chairman Mao's works together, help and educate each other, strive together to become five-good soldiers, and achieve ideological transformation.

Over the past five years, the platoon's party branch has actively led this activity. Every year, old soldiers are discharged and new soldiers are recruited, and the pairs change every year, but the activity has never stopped. The soldiers say: "'One Pair Becomes Red' has become our platoon's heirloom."

The most distinctive feature of this platoon's "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity is the emphasis on the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. They emphasize proletarian politics, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works first, and always, in everything, using Chairman Mao's teachings to examine themselves, criticize their selfishness, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide their every word and deed.

Using "Criticize Self and Rectify Errors" as the guideline, the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity was launched.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity in this platoon developed further. They focused on eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, "pledging to Chairman Mao every day and reporting to Chairman Mao every day" (i.e., "morning pledge, evening report"), making the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity regular and institutionalized. After Chairman Mao issued the call to criticize selfishness and rectify errors, they consciously used "Criticize Self and Rectify Errors" as the guideline in the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity, helping each other to criticize selfishness and study to rectify errors, raising the activity to a new level.

Every morning, they hold the shining red book, facing the brightest red sun in their hearts, the great leader Chairman Mao, and solemnly pledge: "We will read your books for life, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will defend you with our lives, defend your great thoughts with our lives, defend your proletarian revolutionary line with our lives, and be red soldiers loyal to the Party, to the people, and to you, old man."

With the pledge of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, they begin a day of vigorous struggle.

Every evening, the "One Pair" respectfully sits in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, reporting to the great leader Chairman Mao: "In every matter, how have I followed your instructions to eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, to criticize selfishness and rectify errors?" They use the method of "reporting, studying, criticizing, and changing" to summarize the day's thoughts and work with Mao Zedong Thought, seriously criticizing selfishness and rectifying errors.

"Reporting" means reporting to Chairman Mao about one's thoughts and actions of the day, with the spirit of "spearhead to the red," exposing one's fleeting selfish thoughts. In front of Chairman Mao, they are loyal and honest, not telling a single lie. They report both the selfishness they have overcome and the selfishness they have not overcome.

"Studying" means studying Chairman Mao's works together with questions, comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with one's own thoughts and work, seeing where one has solved problems well with Mao Zedong Thought, and where one's thoughts and actions do not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings.

"Criticizing" means using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with "Three Articles" as a motto, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit. "Do not forget the big direction in small matters," raising some problems to the height of the struggle between the two lines, which the soldiers call "raising the level and raising the line."

"Changing" means expressing the determination to change to Chairman Mao, thinking of ways to change, and reporting the results of the change.

In reporting to Chairman Mao, not only do they report themselves, but they also help each other report. If one has not reported the achievements of eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, the "pair" will report it to Chairman Mao on their behalf; if one has not recognized their shortcomings and mistakes, the "pair" will also point them out enthusiastically, truly helping and encouraging each other.

The "One Pair" reports to Chairman Mao every day to ensure that the soldiers are never idle on the battlefield of thought, carrying out the struggle between public and private every day, promoting ideological transformation. Day by day, month by month, accumulating small victories into big victories, they will cultivate a batch after another of communists who are selfless, "completely, thoroughly" serving the people.

During the revolutionary criticism, the platoon has a course called "Daily Criticism." To make "Daily Criticism" effective, preparation is necessary. They implement "Daily Criticism" through "One Pair." Each squad has a "pair" focusing on preparation, criticizing one issue at a time, studying together, and improving the quality of criticism.

In "Daily Criticism," "One Pair" uses the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the reactionary fallacies of China's Khrushchev, such as the philosophy of survival, the parliamentary road, "three selfs and one package," "three reductions and one annihilation," "suffering small losses to gain big advantages," and the bourgeois military line of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They criticize one problem each day, closely combining the rectification of errors with the criticism of selfishness.

In addition to "Daily Criticism," "One Pair" often studies and writes big-character posters criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents together. During holidays and days off, "One Pair" goes to the countryside together, working with poor and lower-middle peasants to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

"One Pair" are bosom friends. In thoughts, studies, and work, they exchange their experiences and insights; if there is anything they cannot understand, they immediately seek help from each other. In this way, in criticizing selfishness and rectifying errors, they grasp the fleeting thoughts in a timely and accurate manner, helping each other at the right points, and achieving quick results.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "One Pair" also helped each other solve the ideological problems of their families. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on: "The attitude of a communist towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance," helping each other to do detailed ideological work for their families. Some soldiers, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on "extreme responsibility" in work and "extreme enthusiasm" towards comrades and the people, wrote letters in the name of "One Pair" to help their families recall their history of being exploited, propagate the highest directives, explain the Party's policies, and criticize the capitalist reactionary line, helping their families to raise their awareness.

The "One Pair" reporting to Chairman Mao every day and criticizing selfishness and rectifying errors is a vivid manifestation of the soldiers' unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. It is a necessary result of emphasizing the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers unanimously say: "Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do; wherever Chairman Mao points, we charge; following Chairman Mao to make a revolution for life, our hearts will never change even if the sea dries up and the stones decay." Only by loving Chairman Mao unlimitedly can one hate revisionism to the bone, producing a great force to criticize selfishness and rectify errors.

Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings, making more self-criticisms, and correctly handling the contradictions that arise in the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity.

In the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity, contradictions often arise between the two parties, sometimes very sharp, with intense ideological struggles, even leading to a breakdown in communication. However, they have all solved these problems well.

The contradictions that arise in "One Pair" generally have the following situations:

1. Assuming the role of a helper, lecturing and commanding others, causing emotional estrangement;
2. Lacking the spirit of dialectical materialism, only seeing the other's shortcomings, making the other feel that they are deliberately "picking faults";
3. Criticizing with impatience and simple methods, revealing all the other's shortcomings at once, making the other lose heart;
4. Pressing with big hats, exaggerating, lacking the spirit of seeking truth from facts;
5. Criticizing hits the mark, touching the soul, and the other's selfishness plays tricks, temporarily unable to accept it.

To correctly handle the above contradictions, the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity can proceed normally and achieve results.

This platoon has summed up a basic experience from continuous practice: when contradictions arise, both parties should study Chairman Mao's works with questions, contrast with Chairman Mao's teachings, make more self-criticisms, examine their own shortcomings and mistakes, criticize selfishness, and correctly handle the contradictions that arise in the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity.

They contrast and examine mainly in the following six aspects, called "six contrasts, six examinations":

1. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely, thoroughly" serving the people, examining whether the purpose and motive of helping and learning is "for the revolution to help, for the revolution to learn";
2. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," examining whether there is deep class feelings towards comrades and whether helping others is sincere;
3. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind," examining whether the attitude is "helping others also learning from others, willingly being a small student";
4. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "dialectical materialism," examining whether the viewpoint is seeing both shortcomings and advantages in oneself and others;
5. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "paying attention to work methods," examining whether the methods are patient and detailed;
6. Contrasting with Chairman Mao's teachings on "seeking truth from facts," examining whether the criticism of others is reasonable.

When solving the contradictions that arise in the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity, most comrades in this platoon can consciously achieve "six contrasts, six examinations." This summer, the deputy squad leader of the reconnaissance squad and his "pair" had a contradiction during "daily training." This soldier had a large error in estimating distance, and when the deputy squad leader pointed it out, he did not accept it. The deputy squad leader measured the map to prove that his opinion was correct, but the soldier still did not accept it, saying: "The map is not necessarily correct." The deputy squad leader got angry: "You just don't bow to the truth, you are so stubborn!" The soldier spoke even more absolutely: "Even if you say there are stones on the mountain, I won't believe it!" In the evening report, they talked it out again. However, they both had the attitude of "not letting problems linger overnight," and went to study Chairman Mao's works. The soldier contrasted with Chairman Mao's teachings, examined that his fear of criticism was due to selfishness, expressing the determination to "correct mistakes for the people's interests"; the deputy squad leader contrasted with Chairman Mao's teachings, examined that his criticism of the other was "not for unity, not for progress, not for doing things well," and his shortcomings. In this way, the contradictions between them were resolved.

Sometimes, when "One Pair" has contradictions, the emotions fluctuate greatly, and the cadres will promptly do ideological work, guiding both parties to conduct "six contrasts, six examinations," promoting both parties to have heart-to-heart talks to resolve contradictions. This June, another squad's deputy squad leader and his "pair" weeded peanuts together. The platoon leader checked the quality and criticized the deputy squad leader, praising the soldier. The soldier's selfishness surfaced: "We are 'pairs,' during the evaluation, I should accompany you to receive criticism (the evaluation is based on 'pairs'), it's better to weed separately." Therefore, when the deputy squad leader called him to weed together, he refused. In the evening report to Chairman Mao, the deputy squad leader criticized the soldier: "You do not obey the leadership, you have no discipline." The soldier criticized the deputy squad leader: "Your weeding quality is not high." Both did not make self-criticisms, and were angry. The squad leader discovered this problem and studied Chairman Mao's works with them. Both examined that they only saw their own correct aspects and did not see their own wrong aspects; only saw the other's wrong aspects and did not see the other's correct aspects. The deputy squad leader sincerely examined: "I was wrong, I had selfishness, feeling that you did not listen to me, reducing my authority, wanting to scold you severely." The soldier moved: "No, deputy squad leader, your criticism is correct, it was I who feared not getting praise, but instead receiving criticism with you, so I did not obey the leadership." Both stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, excitedly saying: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Selfishness separated us, it is you, old man, who brought us together again."

When "One Pair" has contradictions, they can contrast with Chairman Mao's teachings, examine themselves, and make more self-criticisms because they love, believe in, worship, and are loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit. They say: "It's not listening to you, nor is it listening to me, we both listen to Chairman Mao."

The "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity has greatly changed the appearance of the platoon.

The great Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured revolutionary soldiers. The broad masses of soldiers in this platoon, in the "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize selfishness and rectify errors, and their spiritual appearance has changed greatly.

The most prominent change is that studying Chairman Mao's works and propagating Mao Zedong Thought have become the first need of the broad masses of soldiers. "Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being a good soldier of Chairman Mao" has become their code of conduct. They study every day, use every day, study a little, use a little, and wherever they go, they bring Mao Zedong Thought with them. Soldier Zhang Xianglin, when he first enlisted, could not recognize a single character, not even his own name. However, with the specific help of his "pair," he studied Chairman Mao's works with great perseverance and unyielding determination, becoming an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. Last winter, his father died, and on the train back home, he did not forget to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, although he encountered many "roadblocks" when reading Chairman Mao's quotations, he asked passengers for help while propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and everyone called him "Chairman Mao's good soldier." Back home, he broke through the shackles of old traditions, abandoned the feudal funeral rites, organized everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and propagated the revolutionary view of life and death. Before leaving home, he also used the money he had saved to buy dozens of Chairman Mao's works and gave them to the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village.

In production and training, they take on heavy tasks, going where there are difficulties, which has become a common practice in the platoon. They are determined to be like Lei Feng, dedicating their limited lives to the unlimited service of the people. In a disaster relief struggle, a soldier received a telegram from home that his mother was seriously ill and wanted him to return. He first thought not of his own family but of the broad masses of laboring people. He sent the money he had saved to treat his mother's illness while firmly defending his post and devoting himself to the arduous disaster relief struggle.

The "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity has promoted the ideological transformation of the soldiers, and the number of five-good soldiers has increased rapidly. Before the activity began in 1962, five-good soldiers accounted for only 20% of the entire platoon. In 1963, this number jumped to 62.5%, and it has been increasing year by year, reaching 89.5% in 1966. Many five-good soldiers have not rested on their laurels. They say: "Ideological transformation will never graduate, we will make a revolution for life, study Chairman Mao's books for life, and transform our thoughts for life." They take Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, and other good soldiers of Chairman Mao as examples, never being satisfied, and always moving forward.

The ideological transformation of the soldiers has made the appearance of the platoon completely new. Since the launch of this activity, everyone is full of vitality, striving to be the best, and good people and good deeds emerge in layers. The entire platoon has become a strong fighting collective, and in that year, it entered the ranks of exemplary platoons for the first time. In four years, it has maintained the glorious title of exemplary platoon for three years.

The "One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red" activity has mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of soldiers, creating a lively and vivid situation where "soldiers teach soldiers" and everyone does ideological work. As the political instructor said: "To grasp the fleeting thoughts of the platoon, relying on oneself and a few backbones is not enough. 'One Helps One, One Pair Becomes Red' embodies the mass line of ideological work, mobilizing everyone to do ideological work, making the platoon not just one political instructor, but many 'political instructors.' In this way, political and ideological work is done lively, timely, deeply, and specifically." The soldiers' response is also strong, they say: "'One Pair Becomes Red' uses Mao Zedong Thought to help each other, the more help, the closer, the more help, the redder, wholeheartedly serving the people."

Currently, the broad masses of soldiers and officers in this platoon, under the guidance of the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the great banner of "Criticize Self and Rectify Errors," are striding forward on the road of being highly proletarian and highly combat-ready.

    斗私批修的一种好形式
    ——北京部队某连开展“一帮一、一对红”活动的情况调查
    《红旗》杂志调查员
    一九六三年初，北京部队某连，为了进一步贯彻林彪副主席提出的“四个第一”的原则和创造四好连队、五好战士运动的指示，开展了“一帮一、一对红”的活动。
    “一帮一、一对红”，就是在班的范围内，由五好战士和非五好战士，党员和非党员，老战士和新战士，自愿结对，共同活学活用毛主席著作，互相帮助，互相教育，齐争五好，实现思想革命化。
    五年来，连队党支部积极地领导了这一活动。年年有老战士复员，新战士入伍，“对子”年年有变动，但是，活动一直没有中断。战士们说：“‘一对红’成了咱连的传家宝。”
    这个连队“一帮一、一对红”活动的最大特点，就是大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。他们突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位，时时、事事、处处根据毛主席的教导，来对照检查自己，狠斗私心，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅自己的灵魂，指导自己的一言一行。
    以“斗私，批修”为纲，开展“一帮一、一对红”活动
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，这个连队“一帮一、一对红”的活动，有了新的发展。他们围绕着破私立公，“天天向毛主席宣誓，天天向毛主席汇报”（即“早宣誓，晚汇报”），把“一帮一、一对红”的活动，经常化了，制度化了。在毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召以后，他们在“一帮一、一对红”活动中，自觉地以“斗私，批修”为纲，互相帮助斗私，互相研究批修，把这一活动提高到了新的水平。
    每天早晨，他们手持金光闪闪的红色宝书，面向心中最红最红的红太阳、伟大领袖毛主席庄严宣誓：“我们要一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，誓死保卫您，誓死保卫您的伟大思想，誓死保卫您的无产阶级革命路线，誓做一个忠于党，忠于人民，忠于您老人家的红色战士。”他们带着无限忠于毛主席的誓言，开始一天生龙活虎的战斗。
    每天晚上，“一对红”恭恭敬敬地坐在毛主席像前，向伟大领袖毛主席汇报：“一事当前，我是怎样按照您老人家的教导，破私立公、斗私批修的。”他们通过亮、学、斗、改，用毛泽东思想总结一天的思想和工作，严肃认真地斗私批修。
    亮，就是向毛主席汇报自己一天的所想所为，以“刺刀见红”的精神，暴露自己的活思想，包括一闪而过的私心杂念。他们在毛主席面前，忠诚老实，不撒一句谎。对“私”字，破了的汇报，没有破的也汇报。
    学，就是带着问题共同学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的教导同自己的思想、工作对上号，看看在哪些事情上，用毛泽东思想解决得好，有哪些想法和做法，不符合毛主席的教导。
    斗，就是以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以“老三篇”为座右铭，开展批评和自我批评，破私立公。“小事不忘大方向”，把有些问题提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，战士称之为“上纲、上线”。
    改，就是向毛主席表示改的决心，想出改的办法，汇报改的结果。
    在向毛主席汇报中，不仅自己汇报，而且互相帮助汇报。自己没有汇报出来的破私立公的成绩，“对子”就替他向毛主席汇报；自己没有认识到的缺点和错误，“对子”也热忱地向他指出，真正做到互相帮助，互相鞭策。
    “一对红”天天向毛主席汇报，是为了使战士在思想战场上永不停火，每天开展公对私的斗争，促进思想革命化。日积月累，积小胜为大胜，就会培养出一批又一批一心为公，“毫不利己专门利人”，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的共产主义战士。
    在革命大批判中，连队设有“天天批”的课目。“天天批”要收到实效，没有准备是不行的。他们把“天天批”落实到“一对红”身上。每个排有一个“对子”重点准备，一事一批，互相研究，提高批判质量。
    “一对红”在“天天批”中，红箭射黑靶，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学、议会道路、“三自一包”、“三降一灭”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等等反动谬论，以及彭德怀、罗瑞卿等的资产阶级军事路线。每天批判一个问题，把批修和斗私紧密地结合起来。
    除了“天天批”以外，“一对红”还经常共同研究写批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的大字报。利用节日、假日，“一对红”一块到农村，同贫下中农一起，揭露、批判党内最大一小撮走资派的滔天罪行。
    “一对红”是知心朋友，在思想上、学习上、工作上，谁有什么心得体会，就互相交流；有什么想不通的，也马上找对方帮助解疙瘩。这样，在斗私批修中，活思想抓得及时，抓得准，帮在点子上，收效快。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，“一对红”还互相帮助解决家属的思想问题。他们共同学习毛主席关于：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进”的教导，帮助对方向家属做细致的思想工作。有的战士根据毛主席对工作要“极端的负责任”，对同志对人民要“极端的热忱”的教导，以“一对红”的名义，写信帮助家里的人回忆受剥削的家史，宣传最高指示，讲解党的政策，批判资产阶级反动路线，使家里的人提高了认识。
    “一对红”天天向毛主席汇报，天天斗私批修，是战士们无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的生动体现，是大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威的必然结果。战士们异口同声地说：“毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么办；毛主席指到哪里，我们就冲到哪里；跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命，海枯石烂心不变。”只有对毛主席无限热爱，才能对修正主义刻骨仇恨，产生出斗私批修的巨大力量。
    对照毛主席的教导，多作自我批评，正确处理“一帮一、一对红”活动中出现的矛盾
    在“一帮一、一对红”活动中，双方也常常发生矛盾，有时矛盾很尖锐，思想斗争很激烈，甚至闹僵了，谈崩了。但是，他们都很好地解决了。
    “一对红”发生矛盾，一般地有以下几种情形：
    以帮者自居，教训人，指挥人，造成感情上的隔阂；
    缺乏一分为二的观点，只看对方的缺点，使人家感到是故意“找岔”、“挑刺”；
    批评时心情急躁，方法简单，一下子把对方缺点都抖露出来，说得对方泄了气；
    大帽子压人，无限上纲，缺乏实事求是的精神；
    批评打中了要害，触及了灵魂，对方“私”字作怪，一时接受不了。
    正确处理上述矛盾，才能使“一帮一、一对红”活动正常进行和收到实效。
    这个连队从不断的实践中总结出一条基本经验：在出现矛盾的时候，双方带着问题学习毛主席著作，对照毛主席的教导，多作自我批评，检查自己的缺点错误，狠斗“私”字，正确处理“一帮一、一对红”活动中出现的矛盾。
    他们对照、检查，主要有如下六个方面，称为“六对照，六检查”：
    对照毛主席关于“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，检查自己帮、学的目的和动机，是不是“为革命而帮，为革命而学”；
    对照毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，检查自己对同志有没有深厚的阶级感情，帮人是不是诚恳；
    对照毛主席关于“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，检查自己的态度，是不是“帮人也学人，甘当小学生”；
    对照毛主席关于“一分为二”的教导，检查自己的观点，是不是对人对己既看到缺点，又看到优点；
    对照毛主席关于“注意工作方法”的教导，检查自己的方法，是不是耐心，细致；
    对照毛主席关于“实事求是”的教导，检查对别人的批评是不是合情合理。
    这个连队在解决“一帮一、一对红”活动中出现的矛盾时，绝大多数同志都能自觉地做到“六对照，六检查”。今年夏天，侦察班副班长和他的“对子”在“天天练”时发生了矛盾。这个战士目测距离误差很大，当副班长给他指出来的时候，他不接受。副班长量过地图来证实自己的意见是正确的，战士还不接受，却说：“地图也不一定对”。副班长就发了火：“你就是不向真理低头，真顽固！”战士更是把话说绝了：“你说山上有石头我也不相信！”晚上汇报时，又谈僵了。但是，他们都抱着“有问题不过夜”的心情，去学习毛主席著作。战士对照毛主席的教导，检查了自己怕批评是“私”字作怪，表示决心“为人民的利益改正错的”；副班长对照毛主席的教导，检查了自己批评对方“不是为了团结，为了进步，为了把事情弄好”的缺点。这样，相互间的矛盾得到了解决。
    有时“一对红”双方发生矛盾，情绪波动很大，干部就抓紧做思想工作，分别引导双方进行“六对照、六检查”，促进双方谈心，来解决矛盾。今年六月，另一个班的副班长和他的“对子”一起锄花生。连长检查质量时，批评了副班长，表扬了这个战士。这个战士“私”字冒了尖：“我们是‘对子’，讲评时我得陪着你受批评（讲评是以“对子”为单位），不如分开单独去锄。”因此，副班长叫他一起锄，他不干。晚上向毛主席汇报时，副班长批评战士说：“你不服从领导，没有纪律性”。战士就批评副班长：“你锄的质量不高。”两个人都不作自我批评，气得鼓鼓的。班长发现了这个问题，就和他们一道学习毛主席著作。双方检查了只看自己对的方面，没看自己错的方面；只看对方错的方面，没看对方对的方面。副班长诚恳地检查说：“我错了，我有私心，感到你不听话，降低了我的威信，想狠狠地训你一顿。”战士感动地说：“不，副班长，你批评得对，是我怕得不到表扬，反而和你一块受批评，所以就不服从领导了。”两个人共同站在毛主席像前，激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！私心把我们分开，是您老人家又把我们团结起来。”
    在“一对红”双方出现矛盾的时候，他们所以能够对照毛主席的教导，检查自己，多作自我批评，是因为他们对毛主席、毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。他们说：“不是听你的，也不是听我的，咱们都听毛主席的。”
    “一帮一、一对红”活动，极大地改变了连队面貌
    伟大的毛泽东思想，哺育了革命战士。这个连队的广大战士，在“一帮一、一对红”活动中，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，精神面貌有了很大的变化。
    最突出的是，学习毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，已经成为广大战士生活的第一需要。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，已经成为他们的行动准则。他们天天学，天天用，学一点，用一点，走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想带到哪里。战士张祥林刚入伍时，斗大的字不识一升，连自己的名字也不会写。但是，他在“对子”的具体帮助下，以坚强的毅力，百折不挠的决心，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，成了学习毛主席著作的积极分子。去年冬天，他父亲病死了，在回家的火车上，他念念不忘宣传毛泽东思想。当时，尽管他读毛主席语录时遇到不少“拦路虎”，但是，他一面向旅客们请教，一面宣传毛泽东思想，大家称他为“毛主席的好战士”。回到家中，他冲破了旧传统的束缚，摈弃了封建的葬礼，组织大家学习《为人民服务》，宣传革命的生死观。离家前，他还用节省下来的钱，买了几十本毛主席著作，送给村里的贫下中农。
    在生产上、训练中，拣重担子挑，哪里困难往哪里去，在连队里已经蔚然成风。他们决心象雷锋一样，把有限的生命，投入到无限的为人民服务中去。在一次抗灾斗争中，一个战士接到了家里的电报，母亲病重，要他回去。他首先想到的不是自己的家庭，而是广大的劳动人民。他一面把平时节省下来的钱寄给母亲治病，一面坚守岗位，全力投入艰巨的抗灾斗争。
    “一帮一、一对红”活动，促进了战士的思想革命化，五好战士大量增加和迅速成长。在开展活动前的一九六二年，五好战士只占全连的百分之二十，一九六三年跃升到百分之六十二点五，以后逐年上升，一九六六年达到百分之八十九点五。许多五好战士并没有躺在“好”字上停滞不前。他们说：“思想改造永远拿不到毕业证，我们要干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想。”他们以雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等毛主席的好战士为榜样，永不满足，不断前进。
    战士的思想革命化，使连队的面貌焕然一新。自从开展这个活动以来，人人朝气蓬勃，力争上游，好人好事层出不穷，全连团结成为一个坚强的战斗集体，当年第一次跨进了四好连队的行列。四年中，有三年保持了四好连队的光荣称号。
    “一帮一、一对红”活动，调动了广大战士的积极性，出现了“兵教兵”、思想工作人人做的生动活泼的局面。正如指导员所说的：“要抓好连队活思想，光靠自己一人和少数骨干是不行的。‘一帮一、一对红’体现了思想工作的群众路线，发动大家都来做思想工作，连里就不是一个指导员，而是有很多‘指导员’。这样，政治思想工作就做得活，做得及时，做得深透，做得具体有力了。”战士们反映也很强烈，他们说：“‘一对红’用毛泽东思想互相帮助，越帮越亲，越帮越红，全心全意为人民。”
    目前，这个连队的广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“斗私，批修”伟大纲领的指引下，正在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的大道上阔步前进。
