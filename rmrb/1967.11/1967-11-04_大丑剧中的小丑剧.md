    The Farce Within the Farce

    "What will the theaters of Moscow perform in the year of the great celebration?"

    As the Soviet revisionist leadership clamors loudly to "commemorate" the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, the newspapers of Moscow are in a quandary over the selection of festive performances. Looking over the list of performances from the past year, what fills the stages of Moscow are all sorts of vulgar plays, such as "The Thief's Ball," "Love on One Hundred and Four Pages," and "The Nunnery," and the like. Such performances, although they cater to the tastes of the privileged class, are hardly appropriate for the festivities of the October Revolution.

    What to do? *Soviet Culture News* loudly proclaims: quickly create so-called "works that reflect modern life," and perform plays that supposedly reflect the "life of the working class and peasants," as well as dramas that describe "heroic days" and "battle merits." It seems that by doing so, they can cover up the ugly face of the Soviet stage and adorn the festive facade today.

    But isn't this just self-deception?

    Soviet revisionist traitors, you say you want to reflect the "life of workers and peasants," but what kind of workers and peasants, and what kind of life? In the years after the October Revolution, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the vast majority of workers and peasants in the Soviet Union dedicated themselves to the prosperity and strength of the socialist motherland, producing countless heroic figures. Do you dare to bring these glorious heroic images to the stage? It is precisely you who have turned the laboring people of the Soviet Union into slaves to be used by your small privileged class. Do you want to reflect their miserable lives of oppression and exploitation, or do you want to show their discontent and resistance towards you? It is clear that what you want to reflect can only be the distorted and ugly images of workers and peasants.

    You say you want to describe "heroic days" and "battle merits," but this is all nonsense. In the flames of the October Revolution, and in the days of defending Stalingrad, the Soviet people indeed created epic achievements. But these heroic days and battle merits have long been slandered by you. In your eyes, traitors are heroes, and surrender is merit. What you can reflect is only shameful betrayal.

    As for the so-called "reflection of modern life," then, your stage, apart from emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, is not lacking in all sorts of modern figures. Decadent and corrupt youth, money-grubbing fools, traitors who sell their souls, and even mad anti-China clowns, are all active roles on your stage. You are not without modern plays, you perform counter-revolutionary modern plays, and you imitate the mess of modern plays from the West. "Moscow has risen to Broadway" - didn't the American *Life* magazine cheer for your stage long ago?

    In fact, the Soviet revisionist clique does not need to bother to add new performances. Brezhnev and Kosygin, these leading actors on the Soviet stage, have not performed one political farce after another? Their activities today, pretending to "commemorate" the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, are, in the eyes of the revolutionary people of the whole world, the most ridiculous and laughable grand farce.

    大丑剧中的小丑剧
    “莫斯科各剧院在大庆之年将上演些什么？”
    在苏修领导集团大吹大擂地“纪念”十月革命五十周年的时候，莫斯科的报纸正在为选择节日剧目而发愁。翻翻一年来的剧目单，充斥莫斯科舞台的，全是一些黄色的戏剧，什么《小偷的舞会》呀，什么《一百零四页的爱情》呀，什么《女修道院》呀之类的货色。这样的剧目，尽管深合特权阶层的口味，但是在十月革命的节日中尽演这些东西，未免不大雅观。
    怎么办呢？《苏维埃文化报》大声疾呼：要赶紧创作所谓“表现现代的作品”，要上演一些所谓反映“工人阶级和农民生活”以及描写“英雄的日子”和“战斗的功勋”的戏剧。好象这么一来，就能遮住苏修舞台的丑态，装点今天的节日门面了。
    可是，这岂不是自欺欺人吗？
    苏修叛徒们，你们说要表现“工农生活”，究竟要表现什么样的工农，什么样的生活？在十月革命以后的年代里，在列宁和斯大林领导下，苏联的广大工人和农民，为社会主义祖国的繁荣富强进行了忘我的劳动，涌现出了许许多多的英雄人物。你们敢把这些光辉的英雄形象搬上舞台吗？正是你们早已把苏联的劳动人民变为供你们一小撮特权阶层役使的奴隶了。你们究竟是要反映他们受压迫、受剥削的苦难生活呢，还是要表现他们对你们的不满和反抗？很清楚，你们想要表现的，只能是被你们歪曲和丑化了的工农形象。
    你们说要描写“英雄的日子”和“战斗的功勋”，这也是一派鬼话。在十月革命的烽火中，在保卫斯大林格勒的日子里，苏联人民的确建立过史诗般的丰功伟绩。可是，这些英雄的日子和战斗的功勋早就被你们污蔑得不象样子了。在你们看来，叛徒才是英雄，投降便立功勋。你们所能表现的，只能是无耻的背叛。
    至于说到所谓“表现现代生活”，那末，你们的舞台上除了帝王将相、才子佳人之外，也并不缺少形形色色的现代人物。颓废堕落的青年，满身铜臭的财迷，出卖灵魂的叛徒，以至疯狂反华的小丑，都是活跃在你们舞台上的角色。你们并不是没有演现代戏，你们演的是反革命的现代戏，是模仿西方的乌七八糟的现代戏。“莫斯科学起百老汇来了”——美国《生活》杂志不是早就为你们的舞台喝彩了吗？
    其实，苏修集团又何必要为增添新的剧目而费心思呢？勃列日涅夫和柯西金这一些苏修舞台上的名角，不是演出了一幕又一幕的政治丑剧吗？他们今天正在装模作样地“纪念”十月革命五十周年的一切活动，在全世界革命人民看来，就是一出最荒唐可笑的大丑剧。
