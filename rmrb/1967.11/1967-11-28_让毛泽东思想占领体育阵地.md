Editor's Note: The revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers of Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Institute of Physical Education have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and carried out initial reforms on the three projects of radio calisthenics, martial arts, and gymnastics. They have applied the results of these reforms to teaching, pushing forward the proletarian educational revolution in their school by one step. Carrying out the proletarian educational revolution is an unprecedented undertaking. We must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, thoroughly establish the proletarian educational line of Chairman Mao, and in teaching practice, constantly create, constantly summarize, and constantly raise the level. Therefore, we must teach while reforming and cannot wait until "everything is reformed before starting classes" as some people think. Revolutionary teachers must take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, firmly grasp the transformation of the subjective world, discard the word "fear," and replace it with the word "dare." They must dare to teach and dare to reform, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

Let Mao Zedong Thought Occupy the Sports Field

Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Institute of Physical Education Revolutionary Committee

For more than a decade, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the sports circle, with the support of China's Khrushchev, have fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian sports policy of "developing sports to enhance the people's physique." They have promoted a revisionist line that emphasizes fame, championships, and techniques, separating sports from proletarian politics, revolutionary practice, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The proletarian revolutionaries in the sports circle face the arduous task of carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform.

Raising the Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the Radio Calisthenics Field

The fundamental task of the sports revolution is to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the entire sports field.

Radio calisthenics is a simple and easy-to-promote exercise that can effectively improve health and is widely welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our great leader Chairman Mao has actively advocated for radio calisthenics. However, the old Sports Commission, under the control of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, has done everything to suppress radio calisthenics. The tyrant in the sports circle even said, "Radio calisthenics cannot produce world champions and is of no use for exercise." In the radio calisthenics they compiled, there is not a hint of proletarian politics or the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. They only pursue so-called "novel" movements and "pleasing" music, completely lacking the thoughts and movements of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and lacking the national forms that the workers, peasants, and soldiers like and are familiar with.

With boundless reverence for Mao Zedong Thought, under the inspiration and enthusiastic help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, after three major revisions and experiments in more than ten units including workers, peasants, and students, we have initially compiled the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Calisthenics." This set of calisthenics takes "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link and highlights the thought of carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. While doing the calisthenics, loudly recite and sing the quotations of Chairman Mao, using accurate and powerful calisthenics movements to express boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless hatred for the class enemies, embodying the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries.

The "Quotations from Chairman Mao Calisthenics" has been warmly welcomed and enthusiastically cared for by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many movements were repeatedly pondered and experimented with by the compilers and the workers and peasants before being confirmed. A soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army said well: "The Quotations from Chairman Mao Calisthenics is a product of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Doing one set of calisthenics is like attending a lively class on Mao Zedong Thought."

Creating for the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and Utilizing for the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Sports originally belong to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers and firmly follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao of "combining with the broad masses of workers and peasants" to successfully complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Martial arts and wrestling are traditional national sports projects with a broad mass base among the workers and peasants. However, the old martial arts and wrestling, under the guise of inheriting national traditions, have taken a revisionist path of praising the past, advocating feudal superstitions, and cultivating bourgeois individualism. To make martial arts and wrestling truly serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers, since early September, the "Martial Arts Revolution" combat team of our institute has learned from the workers of the Nankou Railway Machinery Factory and together with the workers carried out the reform of martial arts and wrestling.

The workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao, their boundless hatred for the biggest capitalist roader within the Party, their high sense of responsibility for socialist construction, and their noble quality of public-spiritedness have given us great education. With the help of the worker comrades, we compiled the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Fist" and the "Poems of Chairman Mao Fist," using martial arts to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We studied and pondered with the workers, incorporating familiar tools and weapons of the workers, peasants, and soldiers such as hammers, hoes, sickles, and rifles into new martial arts projects to express the great image of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wrestling also closely followed the class struggle situation and combined with the needs of preparation for war, performing "Defending the Autumn Harvest," "Aiding Vietnam and Fighting America," "Militia Training," and so on for the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In the past two months, we have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's wise instruction that students should "focus on learning, while also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing bourgeois ideology" is the only correct direction for the struggle, criticism, and reform in schools.

Opening New Paths for Revolutionary Gymnastics

Competitive gymnastics is an imported sports project. The old gymnastics presented the decayed and rotten things of princes and princesses, and the musical accompaniment was all Swan Lake, Giselle, and other foreign music. In recent years, the world gymnastics competitions have been filled with vulgar and low-level items such as the twist dance. In the past, China's competitive gymnastics completely followed the foreign trend. Facing such a reality, some comrades thought that competitive gymnastics could not be revolutionized and had the idea of canceling the gymnastics project and changing careers early. The revolutionary teachers and students of the gymnastics class in our institute studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "For the art forms of the past era, we do not reject using them, but these old forms, once in our hands, after being transformed and added with new content, become revolutionary things serving the people." This firmly established their confidence in the revolution of gymnastics.

However, some comrades were afraid that after breaking the old framework, foreigners would laugh at us and worry about not getting points in international competitions. It was Chairman Mao's teachings that gave us boundless strength. Chairman Mao said: "Our Chinese nation... has the ability to stand on its own among the nations of the world." Where will world sports go? The revolutionary sports warriors of Mao Zedong have boundless ambition and soaring aspirations, daring to open up new paths and create unprecedented great achievements, opening new paths for world gymnastics.

Inspired by the great revolutionary practice of Comrade Jiang Qing leading ballet and symphony, the revolutionary teachers and students of the gymnastics class decided to reverse the reactionary trend of the world gymnastics becoming increasingly decadent and to open new paths for revolutionary gymnastics.

The first breakthrough in the gymnastics revolution was chosen to be the free exercise with the strongest revisionist flavor. The young revolutionaries said to do it and did it. In early July, they compiled "Crossing the Luding Bridge," making the stage of gymnastics appear for the first time the heroic image of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.

In the initial attempt of the sports revolution, we deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism" is the key to carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform, and is the fundamental policy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, all the revolutionary teachers and students in the institute, under the leadership of the institute's revolutionary committee, further deepen the revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist sports line, and apply the initial experience gained in the reform of the Quotations from Chairman Mao Calisthenics, martial arts, and gymnastics to teaching. Everyone is determined to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the key link of "criticize and repudiate revisionism," fully mobilize the masses, teach while reforming, go deep among the workers and peasants, thoroughly criticize and repudiate, and establish, and follow the bright direction pointed out by Chairman Mao of "developing sports to enhance the people's physique," and are determined to carry the sports revolution through to the end!

### 让毛泽东思想占领体育阵地

专栏：

    编者按：北京工农兵体育学院的广大革命学生、革命教员和革命工人，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，对广播操、武术、体操三个项目，进行了初步改革，并将改革成果运用到教学中去，把他们学校的无产阶级教育革命向前推进了一步。
    进行无产阶级教育革命，是一个史无前例的事业，需要我们大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，在教学实践中，不断创造，不断总结，不断提高。因此，我们应该一边教学，一边改革，决不能象有些人想的那样：“等改好了再上课”。革命的教师要以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓主观世界的改造，丢掉怕字，换上敢字。要敢于教学，敢于改革，同广大革命群众一道，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    让毛泽东思想占领体育阵地
    北京工农兵体育学院革命委员会
    十几年来，我国体育界的党内一小撮走资派在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，疯狂对抗毛主席的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的无产阶级体育方针，推行名利第一、锦标第一、技术第一，脱离无产阶级政治，脱离革命实践，脱离工农兵的修正主义黑线。体育界的无产阶级革命派，面临着艰巨的斗批改的历史任务。
    在广播操阵地上插上毛泽东思想红旗
    体育革命的根本任务，就是让毛泽东思想占领整个体育阵地。
    广播体操是一种简单易行，便于普及，能有效地增进健康的运动项目，深受广大工农兵的欢迎。我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾积极提倡作广播体操。但是旧体委在一小撮反革命修正主义分子把持下，竭力扼杀广播体操。体育界里的阎王竟胡说什么：“广播体操不能出世界冠军，活动活动没啥用处。”在他们编制的广播体操中，丝毫不突出无产阶级政治，不宣传毛泽东思想，只是片面追求所谓“新颖”的动作和“悦耳动听”的音乐，根本没有工农兵的思想感情和动作语言，没有为工农兵所喜闻乐做的民族形式。
    我们怀着对毛泽东思想的无限敬仰，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的启发和热心帮助下，经过三次大规模修改，经过在工农兵学等十几个单位的试验，初步创编成了《毛主席语录操》。这套语录操以斗私批修为纲，突出把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底这一思想。做操时，高声读唱毛主席语录，用准确有力的体操动作表现出对毛主席的无比热爱，对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，体现出无产阶级革命派的革命造反精神。
    《毛主席语录操》受到了工农兵群众的热烈欢迎和热情的关怀。许多动作都是创编人员与工农群众一起反复琢磨、试验，才肯定下来的。解放军某部战士说得好：“语录操是无产阶级文化大革命的产物，是毛泽东思想的胜利。做一次操，就是上一堂生动的毛泽东思想课”。
    为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用
    体育本来是属于工农兵的。我们必须深入工农兵，必须坚定不移地沿着毛主席所指出的“和广大的工农群众结合在一块”的方向走下去，才能胜利地完成斗批改的伟大历史任务。
    武术、摔跤是我国传统的民族运动项目，在工农中有广泛的群众基础。但是，旧武术、摔跤却是在继承民族传统的幌子下，走着一条颂古非今、宣扬封建迷信、培养资产阶级个人主义的修正主义道路。为了能使武术、摔跤真正为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，我院“武术革命”战斗队自九月初以来，向南口铁路机械厂工人学习，同工人一起进行武术、摔跤的改革。
    工人同志们对毛主席的无比热爱，对党内最大的走资派的无比憎恨，对社会主义建设事业的高度责任感，公而忘私的高贵品质都给了我们极大的教育。在工人同志的帮助下，我们创编了《毛主席语录拳》、《毛主席诗词拳》，通过武术来宣传毛泽东思想。我们与工人一同研究、琢磨，把铁锤、铁锹、镰刀、步枪等工农兵最熟悉的工具和武器编为新武术项目，用以表现工农兵的伟大形象。摔跤也密切配合阶级斗争形势，结合备战需要，为工农兵表演了《保卫秋收》、《援越抗美》、《民兵训练》等等。
    两个月来，我们深深地感觉到毛主席关于学生“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的英明指示，是学校斗批改的唯一正确的方向。
    为革命体操开创新的道路
    竞技体操是外来的运动项目。旧体操所表现的是王子、公主之类腐朽不堪的东西，音乐伴奏也全是天鹅湖、吉赛尔等洋音乐。近些年来，在世界体操比赛中更是充斥着扭摆舞等下流低级的货色。过去，中国的竞技体操完全是崇洋学洋。面对着这样的现实，有的同志认为竞技体操没法革命了，从而产生了取消体操项目，趁早改行的想法。我院体操班的革命师生学习了毛主席的教导：“对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了”，从而坚定了体操革命的信心。
    但是，还有的同志怕我们破了老框框之后，外国人会笑话，担心国际比赛得不到分数。还是毛主席的教导给了我们无穷的力量，毛主席说：“我们中华民族……有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”世界体育向何处去？毛主席的革命体育战士雄心如海，壮志凌云，敢于开天辟地，标新立异，创立前人所从未作过的伟大业绩，为世界体操开创新的道路。
    在江青同志领导芭蕾舞、交响乐伟大革命实践的鼓舞下，体操班革命师生下定决心，要扭转世界体操日益没落的反动潮流，要为革命体操开创新的道路。
    体操革命的第一个突破口，选定了修正主义味道最浓的自由体操。小将们说干就干，七月初，便创编了《飞夺泸定桥》，使体操舞台上第一次出现了中国工农红军的英雄形象。
    在进行体育革命的初步尝试中，我们深深体会到毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，是搞好斗批改的关键，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针。现在，全院革命师生在院革命委员会领导下，进一步深入开展革命大批判，大破修正主义体育路线，并把在改革语录操、武术和体操的实践中所取得的初步经验运用到教学中去。大家决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，充分发动群众，边复课，边改革，深入工农，大破大立，沿着毛主席所指出的“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的光辉方向，誓把体育革命进行到底！
