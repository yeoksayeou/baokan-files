The notorious literary forerunner of Soviet revisionism, Sholokhov, often speaks of "conscience." He says things like, "Literature, this is a matter of conscience," and so on.

In class society, different classes have different standpoints, and all ideas bear the stamp of class. There is no such thing as an abstract "conscience," nor has there ever been any classless "literature." In the eyes of the proletariat, literature is a tool of class struggle, and proletarian revolutionary literary workers are the spokesmen of the proletariat and the revolutionary people.

What kind of "conscience" does Sholokhov have?

Just after the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin, passed away, Sholokhov hypocritically lamented, "Father, farewell! Farewell, dear father whom I loved all my life!" Yet, the same Sholokhov, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, cursed Stalin for bringing "so many irreparable disasters to the Party." He also shamelessly and obsequiously expressed his "unspeakable" "admiration" for Khrushchev!

Turning over his hand to create clouds, and turning it back to create rain. Maliciously slandering Stalin and attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat—this is Sholokhov's "conscience"!

The great Soviet Red Army was created and led by Lenin and Stalin. In "And Quiet Flows the Don," the Red Army is depicted as "fearing the rebel army like quails fearing eagles," as "cowardly eggs." The protagonist of "One Man's Fate," praised by Khrushchev, is nothing but a "hero" who "legs tremble and body falls like a bundle of cut grass" at the sight of the German invaders!

To wantonly trample on the great wall of the Soviet people and to maliciously distort the image of the Soviet Red Army—this is Sholokhov's "conscience"!

Under Stalin's leadership, the great Soviet working people, in the agricultural collectivization movement, adhered to the Leninist line and triumphantly embarked on the broad road of agricultural collectivization. However, in Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned," the poor and middle peasants are depicted as cowardly, selfish, and destructive of the collectivization movement, slaughtering livestock and stealing seeds; the Party cadres are nothing but right-opportunists and hysterical madmen, even declaring that they want to "hang all the laboring masses"...

Frantically attacking the great agricultural collectivization movement and shamelessly slandering the Bolshevik Party led by Stalin and the Soviet people—this is Sholokhov's "conscience"!

Enough, enough! Heroes and traitors have never had a common language, and revolution and counter-revolution have never had common feelings.

In a word, Sholokhov's "conscience" is a betrayal of the revolution and cruelty to the people! This is the black "conscience" of counter-revolution!

The revolutionary people will never believe in the "conscience" of Sholokhov and his ilk. We must expose their rotten black hearts and reveal their true faces!

    肖洛霍夫的“良心”
    南卫东
    臭名远扬的苏修文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫，口头上经常挂着“良心”二字。什么“文学，这是良心问题”啊，如此等等。
    在阶级社会里，不同的阶级有不同的立场，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印，根本没有什么抽象的“良心”，也从来没有什么超阶级的“文学”。在无产阶级看来，文学是阶级斗争的工具，无产阶级革命的文学工作者是无产阶级和革命人民的代言人。
    肖洛霍夫的所谓“良心”，究竟是什么货色呢？
    伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林刚刚逝世的时候，肖洛霍夫曾假惺惺地悲呼：“父亲，永别了！永别了，亲爱的终生都热爱的父亲！”可是，同一个肖洛霍夫，在苏共二十大以后，却又破口大骂斯大林“给党带来了这么多不可弥补的祸害”；并肉麻地、恬不知耻地向赫鲁晓夫表白了“说不出口”的“男人的”“爱慕之情”！
    翻手为云，覆手为雨。恶毒地污蔑斯大林，攻击无产阶级专政——这就是肖洛霍夫的“良心”！
    伟大的苏联红军，是列宁、斯大林亲手缔造和领导的英雄军队。在《静静的顿河》里，红军却成了“象鹌鹑躲避老鹰似的”害怕叛军的“熊蛋包”。被赫鲁晓夫称赞不绝的《一个人的遭遇》，它的主人公索科洛夫也不过是一见德寇就“两腿发软，身子象一束割下的草那样倒下来”的“英雄”！
    对于苏维埃人民的伟大长城如此肆意糟踏，对于苏联红军的形象如此恶毒地歪曲——这就是肖洛霍夫的“良心”！
    伟大的苏联劳动人民，在斯大林的领导下，在农业集体化运动中，坚持列宁主义路线，胜利地走上了农业集体化的康庄大道。然而，在肖洛霍夫的《被开垦的处女地》中，贫下中农却是贪生怕死，自私自利，宰家畜，抢谷种，一味地对抗和破坏集体化运动的“坏分子”；党的干部又是地地道道的右倾机会主义者和歇斯底里的疯子，甚至声言要把劳动群众“全都绞死”……
    疯狂地攻击伟大的农业集体化运动，肆无忌惮地污蔑以斯大林为首的布尔什维克党和苏联人民——这就是肖洛霍夫的“良心”！
    够了，够了！英雄和叛徒从来没有共同的语言，革命和反革命本来就不存在相通的感情。
    一句话，肖洛霍夫的“良心”，就是对革命的背叛，对人民的残忍！这是反革命的黑“良心”！
    革命的人民，决不会听信肖洛霍夫之流的什么“良心”的那一套，我们一定要挖出他们烂透了的黑心，把他们的真面目拿来示众！
