The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has, over the past few years, under the banner of "aiding" underdeveloped countries, been swindling and deceiving their way across Africa. Under the guise of "aid," they have been plundering. Their despicable tricks are no different from those of U.S. imperialism. The following report on an incident in an African country fully exposes the true nature of the Soviet revisionists' economic "aid" to foreign countries and the enormous harm they have inflicted on African countries.

A few years ago, the Soviet revisionist leadership, taking advantage of the urgent desire of newly independent African countries to develop their national economies, "assisted" this African country in building a number of industrial and agricultural projects. These included a dairy factory, a meat processing plant, a fish processing plant, and three large farms. However, more than four years have passed, and the "aid" that the Soviet revisionists boasted about has not brought any benefits to this country. Instead, the heavy burden of debt has been placed on the backs of the people of this country.

According to the agreement, although the Soviet revisionists initially provided loans for these industrial and agricultural projects, no one knew exactly how much each specific project would cost. As a result, the construction cost of each industrial project increased significantly. In the eyes of the Soviet revisionists, as long as the money is spent, the debt will ultimately be repaid by the aid-recipient country.

The goods provided by the Soviet revisionists to cover local expenses for these projects either exceeded the market sales volume of this country by more than double or were junk items that the Soviet revisionists could not find a market for. As a result, the goods could not be sold, local expenses could not be paid, and the construction period was delayed again and again.

The pattern of the Soviet revisionists' "aid" in this country is: before starting each project, they first build comfortable and luxurious houses for the "experts," buy refrigerators and cars, and only after arranging everything comfortably for themselves do they start "working." When local expenses cannot be paid and the project is forced to halt, and local workers have not received a penny of wages for months, the Soviet revisionists' "experts," who have nothing to do all day, continue to receive high salaries. Their main "work" each day becomes buying imported goods. Some projects are delayed for one or two years, and they spend one or two years doing nothing. The Soviet revisionists' loans flow into the pockets of these "experts."

When designing these industrial and agricultural projects, the Soviet revisionists did not consider the actual situation of the aid-recipient country at all. Taking the dairy factory as an example, this country is a livestock-raising country, and the vast majority of people are accustomed to drinking cow and sheep milk. However, the Soviet revisionists built this dairy factory far away from the dairy supply area in the capital of this country, producing butter, cheese, and what they call "sanitary milk" for Europeans. Therefore, since the factory started production more than two years ago, due to insufficient milk supply, the operating rate has only reached one-fifth, and the products have been unsold due to their high prices and unpopularity among the majority of people.

Is it "aid" or plunder? Look at the meat processing plant that has already been completed in this African country, and it is clear. This plant, which can slaughter 5,000 cattle per month, was completed by the Soviet revisionists in more than four years. Before the factory started production, the Soviet revisionists demanded that this aid-recipient country repay a staggering amount of interest. This country had to send the meat products of the factory to the Soviet Union to repay the debt. It is estimated that it will take more than ten years to repay the loan. This means that the Soviet revisionists moved a meat processing plant to Africa and used the cheap raw materials and labor of African countries to produce for themselves for more than ten years. In more than ten years, this African country has not gained any benefits from this factory. On the contrary, it has to allocate more than ten million shillings (one-fifth of the country's total budget) from the national treasury each year to support the factory's operation. After more than ten years, what this African country gets is only some dilapidated factory buildings and machinery. No wonder someone angrily said: The Soviet revisionists' "aid" is simply extortion!

As for the large farms built by the Soviet revisionists in this country, they have long become overgrown with weeds and bushes, a wild world of wolves and pigs. Hundreds of tractors and other agricultural machinery are lying idle in the wild, rotting away due to lack of use. The Soviet revisionists' lies about a "grain base" and "self-sufficiency in oil" have already burst like soap bubbles.

### 挂“援助”之名　行掠夺之实  苏修的“援助”给受“援”国家造成巨大危害

    挂“援助”之名　行掠夺之实
    苏修的“援助”给受“援”国家造成巨大危害
    新华社讯　苏联修正主义领导集团几年来打着“援助”不发达国家的旗号，在非洲到处招摇撞骗，以“援助”为名，行掠夺之实。其卑鄙的伎俩，与美帝国主义的行径如出一辙。下面报道的发生在非洲一个国家的事实，就充分暴露了苏修对外经济“援助”的实质，以及它给非洲国家带来了多么大的危害。
    几年前，苏修领导集团利用非洲新独立国家要求发展民族经济的迫切心情，为这个非洲国家“援建”了一批工农业项目。其中，有牛奶厂、肉类加工厂、鱼类加工厂和三个大农场。但是，四年多的时间过去了，苏修吹得震天响的“援助”，不仅没有给这个国家带来任何好处，相反，磨盘石般的债务，却沉重地压在这个国家人民的脊背上。
    按照协议，苏修当初虽然为这批工农业项目提供了贷款，但是每个具体项目究竟要花多少钱，却无人知晓。结果，每个工业项目的造价都大大增加。在苏修看来，反正羊毛出在羊身上，无论花多少钱，债总是要受“援”国偿还的。
    苏修为解决这些工程的地方费用而提供的商品，有的超过这个国家市场的销售量一倍还多，有的则是苏修找不到出路而拿来倾销的破烂物品。结果，商品卖不出去，地方费用无法支付，致使工期一拖再拖。
    苏修在这个国家“援建”的规律是：在每个工程开始之前，先营造“专家”们漂亮而舒适的住房，购置电冰箱和汽车，等他们个人的生活安排得一切舒舒服服之后，再开始“工作”。而到地方费用支付不出，工程被迫中断，当地工人几个月拿不到一文钱的工资的时候，每天无所事事的苏修“专家”们，高工资却照领不误，他们每天的主要“工作”，成了抢购进口物资。有的工程拖期一、两年，他们就这样地混一、两年。苏修的贷款也就源源地流到这些“专家”们的私囊中去了。
    苏修在设计这些工农业项目时，毫不考虑受“援”国的实际情况。以牛奶厂为例，这个国家是一个畜牧业国家，广大人民习惯喝牛、羊奶。苏修却在远离供应原奶的牧区的这个国家的首都，建了这座牛奶厂，生产的又是欧洲人吃的黄油、奶酪以及什么“卫生牛奶”之类的东西。因此，自这个工厂投入生产两年多以来，由于原奶供应不足，开工率仅达五分之一，产品也因价格昂贵，且不合广大人民的习惯而滞销。
    到底是“援助”，还是掠夺？请看在这个非洲国家现已完工的肉类加工厂便一目了然。这座每月可屠宰五千头牛的工厂，是苏修花了四年多的时间完成的。工厂尚未生产，苏修就要求这个受“援”国偿还数字惊人的利息。这个国家只有把工厂的肉类产品送到苏联去抵债。据计算，要连续十多年才能偿清债款。这就是说，苏修把一座肉类加工厂搬到了非洲，利用非洲国家的廉价原料和劳动力为自己生产了十余年。在十多年中，这个非洲国家不仅从这座工厂中一点好处也得不到，相反，每年却要从国库中拨出一千多万先令（占这个国家总预算的二十分之一），来支撑工厂开工。十多年后，这个非洲国家所得到的只不过是一些陈旧不堪的厂房和机器。难怪有人气愤地说：苏修的“援助”，简直是讹诈！
    至于苏修在这个国家建的大农场呢？早已成了杂草丛生、灌木成林，狼奔豕逐的莽原世界了。几百台拖拉机和其他农业机械躺在野地里睡大觉，由于无人问津，已经在烂掉。苏修骗人的“粮食基地”、“油料自给”的神话，已经成了肥皂泡。
