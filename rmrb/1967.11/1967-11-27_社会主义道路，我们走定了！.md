After studying the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside," the poor and lower-middle peasants of Wugong Brigade, Wugong Commune, Rao Yang County unanimously said that this article speaks for their hearts and exposes the reactionary nature of China's Khrushchev. Everyone said that they must closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow Mao Zedong Thought, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they will thoroughly settle accounts with and criticize the poison of revisionism that China's Khrushchev spread in the countryside. They will resolutely follow the road indicated by Chairman Mao and continue on to communism.

In 1943, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "organize." The poor and lower-middle peasants of our brigade immediately responded and in that November organized the "land partnership." From then on, our brigade has been on the socialist road for twenty-four whole years. In these more than twenty years, the changes in our brigade have been tremendous. Just take grain production as an example: in the old society, the yield per mu was only about one hundred jin; now it has increased to seven or eight hundred jin. Apart from completing the state's procurement tasks year after year, our brigade has also stored more than three hundred thousand jin of grain. In the old society, the poor and lower-middle peasants could not even maintain a winter's supply of grain each year; now not only do they have enough to eat and wear, but most households also have stored grain and savings. Besides, now there is electric lighting, irrigation machines, tractors for plowing, and mills for grinding grain. These things were not even dared to be imagined in the old society. All of this is the result of advancing on the great socialist road under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao.

However, China's Khrushchev is extremely hostile to the socialist road of agricultural collectivization. He uses every means to sabotage the collective economy, protect the rich peasant economy, and advocate for the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" for each household. During the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, he maliciously said that "industry should retreat sufficiently, and agriculture should also retreat sufficiently." He advocates for contracting production to households and individual farming. The tricks that China's Khrushchev plays are not for anything else; they are to make the wheel of history turn backward, to make our country restore capitalism, and to make us poor and lower-middle peasants return to the old society to suffer again. But let me tell you, China's Khrushchev, with our invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, your wolfish ambitions will never succeed!

Chairman Mao teaches us: Only socialism can save China. The socialist road indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely walk! Even if our heads are chopped off, we will not take the road of ruining thousands of households to enrich one, and we will not go back. Now, our brigade, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has held three sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres and the masses. Through the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses have come to love Chairman Mao even more and hate China's Khrushchev, the son and grandson of landlords and rich peasants, even more. Everyone resolutely declares that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev, fight him down, and completely uproot the roots of revisionism.

    社会主义道路，我们走定了！
    耿长锁
    学习了《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章以后，俺们饶阳县五公公社五公大队的贫下中农一致反映，这篇文章说出了大家的心里话，戳穿了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动本质。大家都说，俺们一定要紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底清算和批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村散布的修正主义流毒，坚决按照毛主席指引的道路走下去，一直走到共产主义。
    一九四三年，毛主席发出了“组织起来”的伟大号召，俺们大队贫下中农立即响应，就在那年十一月组织起了土地“合伙组”。打那个时候起，俺们大队在社会主义道路上，已走了整整二十四个年头。在这二十多年里，俺们大队的变化可真是翻天覆地。就拿粮食产量来说，旧社会亩产不过百斤左右，现在亩产增加到七、八百斤，除了年年超额完成国家的征购任务以外，俺们大队还储备了三十多万斤粮食。旧社会，贫下中农每年收的粮食，连个冬饱也维持不住，现在不仅吃穿不愁，大多数的户都有存粮和存款。除此以外，现在照明有电灯，浇地有机器，耕地用拖拉机，磨面有加工厂……。象这些事，在旧社会连想都不敢想。这都是按照伟大舵手毛主席指引的方向，在社会主义大道上不断前进的结果。
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫极端仇视农业集体化这条社会主义道路。他千方百计地破坏集体经济，保护富农经济，提倡什么发展“三马一犁一车”的农户。在我国经济暂时困难时期，他胡说什么“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够”。他提倡包产到户，单干。中国赫鲁晓夫搞的这一套，不是别的，就是想让历史的车轮倒转，就是想让我们国家复辟资本主义，就是想让我们贫下中农回到旧社会吃二遍苦。但是，告诉你吧，中国的赫鲁晓夫，我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，你的狼子野心是决不会得逞的！
    毛主席教导我们：只有社会主义能够救中国。伟大领袖毛主席指引的社会主义道路，我们贫下中农走定了！砍了头也不能走那种败千家，富一户的回头路。现在，俺们大队紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，已举办了三期由干部和群众参加的毛泽东思想学习班。经过活学活用毛主席著作，使革命干部和革命群众更加无限热爱毛主席，恨透了中国赫鲁晓夫这个地富的孝子贤孙。大家坚决表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国赫鲁晓夫批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。
