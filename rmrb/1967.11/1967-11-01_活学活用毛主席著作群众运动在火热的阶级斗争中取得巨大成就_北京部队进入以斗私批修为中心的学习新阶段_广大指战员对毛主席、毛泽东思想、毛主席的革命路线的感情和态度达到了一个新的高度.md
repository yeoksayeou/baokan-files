In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison has entered a new stage in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In this mass learning movement, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have elevated their feelings and attitudes towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to a new height; they have learned and applied in the midst of struggle, reaching a new level; and they have engaged in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, entering a new realm in transforming their worldview.

The Beijing Garrison is a heroic unit. During the revolutionary wars and in the struggle to defend the motherland, they closely followed Chairman Mao and established immortal merits for the people. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, better studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and achieved even more outstanding results in defending Chairman Mao, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carrying out the glorious tasks of "supporting the left," "military control," and "three supports, two militaries." They have established new merits for the people.

Over the past year, the Beijing Garrison, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school, has seriously implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. They have consciously placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. Regardless of how busy the work is, at all levels of leadership, when arranging, inspecting, and summarizing work, they always place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works first. This year, more learning Chairman Mao's works enthusiastically conferences have been held than ever before, and more study and application meetings of Chairman Mao's works have been held and applied more actively than ever before. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have deeply felt that if you do not grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works tightly, you are grasping at nothing; if you do not busy yourself with self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, you are busy with nothing.

In the new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the Beijing Garrison have greatly deepened their profound class feelings towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have personally experienced the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. They have more deeply recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest truth of the proletarian revolution and the lifeblood of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. They have further established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The image of Chairman Mao is everywhere in the unit, songs praising Chairman Mao are sung non-stop, Chairman Mao's works are recited every day, and Chairman Mao's thoughts are applied in everything. In most companies, the practice of consulting Chairman Mao's works in the morning and checking one's words and deeds against Chairman Mao's works in the evening has become widespread. Company meetings, platoon meetings, and other meetings have all become meetings for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Officers and soldiers, in carrying out various tasks, regardless of what difficulties they encounter or what dangers they face, always keep Chairman Mao's book in hand, keep Chairman Mao's words in mouth, and keep Chairman Mao's teachings in action. A soldier named Wang Hao from the First Company of a certain unit was buried under a landslide. After more than four hours of rescue by his comrades, he was saved. When his body was numb and his breathing was extremely difficult, he still silently recited Chairman Mao's teachings. After being rescued, his head emerged first, and his first words were, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Because of his severe injuries, he fainted several times, and every time he regained consciousness, his first words were, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

In the new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to learn and apply in the midst of struggle, have actively participated in the fiery class struggle. They have diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's great theory of carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have consciously placed themselves in the struggle between the two lines and raised the issues to the level of the struggle between the two lines. Over the past year, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have deeply felt that in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the situation of struggle changes the fastest, the problems encountered are the most complex, the ideological struggle is the most intense, and the soul is touched the deepest. In this situation, they have brought urgent questions to Chairman Mao's works for answers, learned deeply, remembered firmly, applied effectively, and understood profoundly. In the education of the struggle between the two lines and the great criticism of the revolution, they have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works more actively, further clarified the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism in China, heightened the awareness of defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, and determined to "fight for the dictatorship of the proletariat in life and die for the dictatorship of the proletariat in death." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks have, through the extensive application of Chairman Mao's works, stood more firmly on the side of the left, loved what the left loved, hated what the left hated, and guided the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have learned the mass line in the great storm of the masses' struggle, further established deep class feelings with the revolutionary masses, and strengthened the relationship between the military and the people.

Some officers who used to appear before the masses in the attitude of "educators" have, after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and mass perspective in the struggle, now been able to go deep into reality, put down their airs, and humbly become students of the masses. Those who used to be unwilling to listen to the masses' criticisms and opposing opinions have, after learning and applying in the struggle, now been able to actively go to the masses to seek opinions, voluntarily check their shortcomings, and improve their work.

Vice Chairman Lin said, "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the Beijing Garrison, in accordance with Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, have, over the past year, extensively and deeply carried out the activity of breaking private interests and establishing public interests in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Through the struggle practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have deeply recognized that criticizing revisionism must start with self-criticism. Many officers and soldiers fighting on the front line of the "three supports, two militaries" have not only established new merits in supporting the left but have also been models in leading self-criticism. A certain regiment's deputy political commissar, Jo Xizeng, who was sent to Tianjin Yan'an Middle School to carry out military training tasks, felt that there was no precedent when a few students proposed the initiative to "realize great unity based on teaching classes." He was afraid of making mistakes and had a fierce struggle in his mind between "waiting" and "innovating." At this critical moment, they studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, realized that it was private interests at work, and resolutely threw away the word "fear" and replaced it with the word "dare." He firmly supported this new thing and, together with the revolutionary youngsters, created new experiences. When the experience of Yan'an Middle School was affirmed and supported by Chairman Mao, he and the revolutionary teachers and students had the tendency of "arrogance" in their minds. He timely studied Chairman Mao's teachings on being modest and prudent, took the lead in opening the door for rectification, listened to criticism, and further consolidated and developed the great unity of the revolution. He created the experience of resuming classes and making the revolution, and at the same time, won a great victory in breaking private interests and establishing public interests in his mind.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers have broken private interests and established public interests, transforming their worldview, and greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the unit. Many advanced individuals and moving deeds of public-spiritedness, selflessness, wholeheartedness for the public, and wholeheartedness for the people have emerged in the unit. A certain regiment's battalion commander, Liu Tiange, in the critical moment when the lives of the people and revolutionary comrades were in danger, had bravely and selflessly rescued others six times. Last year, during a live grenade throwing training for new recruits, a soldier, due to nervousness, threw the grenade near a nearby embankment. The smoking grenade quickly rolled back to the side of five soldiers. At this critical moment when these comrades' lives were seriously threatened, Liu Tiange stepped forward, grabbed the grenade body, and threw it out forcefully. As soon as he threw it, the grenade exploded. He himself was injured in 81 places, saving the lives of his class brothers. Liu Tiange was able to exhibit such heroic deeds because he had always broken private interests and established public interests with a high attitude and persistently used Mao Zedong Thought to transform his soul.

Now, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the Beijing Garrison are launching a learning movement centered on Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize private interests and revisionism." The broad ranks of officers and soldiers are determined to advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao with high fighting spirit!

    活学活用毛主席著作群众运动在火热的阶级斗争中取得巨大成就
    北京部队进入以斗私批修为中心的学习新阶段
    广大指战员对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线的感情和态度达到了一个新的高度
    新华社三十一日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国人民解放军北京部队活学活用毛主席著作群众运动进入了新的阶段。广大指战员在群众性的学习运动中，对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线的感情和态度提高到了一个新的高度；在斗争中学，在斗争中用，达到了一个新的水平；斗私批修，改造世界观，进入了一个新境界。
      北京部队是一支英雄的部队。在革命战争年代和保卫祖国的斗争中，紧跟毛主席，为人民立下了不朽的功勋。无产阶级文化大革命以来，广大指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”等各项光荣任务中，作出了更加优异的成绩，为人民立下了新的功勋。
    一年多来，北京部队遵照毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的伟大号召，认真执行了林副主席关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段的指示，更加自觉地把学习毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上。无论工作怎样千头万绪，各级领导在布置、检查和总结工作时，都把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位。今年召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子会议比以往任何一年都多，活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，也比过去开得普遍，用得活。广大指战员深有体会地说：千抓万抓，不抓紧活学活用毛主席著作就是瞎抓；千忙万忙，不忙斗私批修就是瞎忙。
    在群众性的活学活用毛主席著作新高潮中，北京部队广大指战员大大加深了对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线无比深厚的阶级感情。广大指战员在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，亲身体会到毛主席革命路线的无比正确，毛泽东思想的无穷威力，更加深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命的最高真理，是中国人民和世界革命人民的命根子，从而进一步树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。部队中毛主席的光辉形象处处可见，毛主席的颂歌唱不绝口，毛主席的著作天天诵读，毛主席的思想事事运用。广大连队普遍开展了早晨向伟大领袖毛主席的著作请教，晚上对照毛主席的著作检查一天的言论和行动的活动，班务会、排务会和其他会议都成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会。干部战士在执行各项任务中，不论遇到什么困难，不论面临何种险境，总是身不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席的教导。某部一连战士王浩，在一次塌方事故中，全身被埋在土石方下面，经过同志们四个多小时的抢救，才抢救出来。当他全身麻木，呼吸极端困难时仍然默念毛主席的教导。经过抢救，他的头部露了出来，第一句话就喊：“毛主席万岁！”因为伤重，他曾几次昏迷过去，每当清醒过来第一句话喊的都是“毛主席万岁！”
    在活学活用毛主席著作新高潮中，广大指战员遵照林副主席关于在斗争中学，在斗争中用的指示，积极投入了火热的阶级斗争，狠学狠用毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命的伟大理论，自觉地把自己摆到两条路线的斗争当中去，把问题提到两条路线斗争的纲上来。一年多来的实践，使广大干部战士深刻地体会到，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，斗争形势变化最迅速，遇到的问题最复杂，思想斗争最激烈，触及灵魂最深刻，在这种情况下带着迫切需要回答的问题向毛主席著作请教，学得懂，记得牢，用得上，理解最深。他们在两条路线斗争教育和革命的大批判中，活学活用毛主席著作，更加认清了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，提高了捍卫无产阶级政权的自觉性，决心“生为无产阶级政权而战，死为无产阶级政权而献身。”执行“三支”“两军”任务的广大干部战士，通过大学大用毛主席著作，更加坚定地站在左派一边，爱左派所爱，恨左派所恨，引导无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进。广大指战员在群众斗争的大风雨中学习群众观点，进一步同革命群众建立了深厚的阶级感情，密切了军民关系。　
    过去常以“教育者”姿态出现在群众中的个别干部，在斗争中反复学习毛主席关于群众观点、群众路线等方面的教导以后，现在做到了能深入实际，放下架子，甘当群众小学生。过去不大愿意听群众的批评和反面意见的同志，经过在斗争中学，斗争中用，现在能主动深入到群众中去征求意见，自觉地检查缺点，改进工作。
    林副主席说：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”北京部队广大指战员遵照林副主席这一指示，一年来在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中广泛深入地开展了破私立公的活动。他们通过无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，深刻地认识到，批修必须斗私。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的许多指战员，不仅在支左工作中立了新功，在带头斗私方面也是模范。到天津延安中学执行军训任务的某团副政治委员乔喜增，当少数同学提出“以教学班为基础实现革命大联合”的倡议时，他开始感到没有先例，怕弄不好犯错误，头脑里出现了“等”还是“创”的激烈斗争。在这个关键时刻，他们学习了毛主席的有关教导，认识到这是私心在作怪，于是毅然决然地抛掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，坚决支持这一新生事物，和革命小将一起创造了新经验。当延安中学的经验得到毛主席的肯定和支持后，他和革命师生在思想上出现了“骄”的苗头。他又及时学习了毛主席关于谦虚谨慎的教导，带头开门整风，听取批评意见，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合，创出了复课闹革命的经验，同时也在思想上打了一次破私立公的大胜仗。
    广大指战员破私立公，改造世界观，大大促进了部队的思想革命化。部队中出现了许多公而忘私，舍己为人，一心为公，一心为人民的先进人物和动人的事迹。某部营长刘天革在人民群众和革命战友的生命遇到危险的紧急关头，曾先后六次奋不顾身，舍己救人。去年在一次组织新战士手榴弹实弹投掷训练中，一个战士由于心情紧张把手榴弹投到近旁的堤坡上，冒烟的手榴弹迅速滚回到五个战士的身边。在这些同志生命受到严重威胁的紧急时刻，刘天革挺身而出，抓住弹体，猛往外一扔，刚一出手，手榴弹就爆炸了。他自己负伤八十一处，保护了阶级兄弟的生命。刘天革所以能够表现出这样的英雄行为，就是他平时以高姿态破私立公，坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂的结果。
    现在，北京部队广大指战员正在展开以毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召为中心的学习运动，广大干部战士决心以高昂的战斗激情，沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进！
