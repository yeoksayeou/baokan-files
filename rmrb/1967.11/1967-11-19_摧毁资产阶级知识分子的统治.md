	Destroy the Rule of the Bourgeois Intellectuals
	New Peking University Xiao Zheji

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not be allowed to continue." Chairman Mao's teachings point out the crucial issue in the education sector with precision.

	The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the education sector have madly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line, and peddling the black goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Old Peking University was a bastion of bourgeois reaction directly controlled by the Chinese Khrushchev. The authority of Mao Zedong Thought had not been established at all in Peking University. None of the science and language departments had courses on Mao Zedong Thought. Although some courses on Mao Zedong Thought were offered in the liberal arts departments, they were few and far between, serving merely as decorations. On the contrary, they vigorously strengthened bourgeois education, spreading bourgeois poison, corrupting the younger generation, and serving the restoration of capitalism.

	Since 1960, courses promoting "feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism" have significantly increased. For example, in eight majors such as Chinese literature, Chinese language, classical literature, philosophy, politics, law, economics, and library science, there are a total of 127 foundational courses, of which 37 courses, accounting for 29%, are permeated with feudalist poison. In the philosophy department's philosophy major, there are 40 specialized courses, of which 30 are courses on feudalism and capitalism. In the history of Chinese philosophy, there are 16 courses from "The Analects" to "Tan Sitong." Other chaotic bourgeois goods are all present.

	Under the instigation and encouragement of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Lu Ping, bourgeois intellectuals have been spreading poison in the classrooms. The reactionary academic "authority" and feudal remnant Feng Youlan has been fervently praising Confucius in the classroom, claiming that "Confucianism is a new thing with a bright future." Some reactionary writers have even said, "The reason Chinese people are Chinese is because of Confucius!" This is extremely arrogant.

	Since liberation, Peking University has been ruled by capitalist roaders within the party and bourgeois intellectuals, becoming a stronghold for their restoration of capitalism in China. On one hand, they have been ruthlessly attacking and persecuting revolutionary cadres of worker, peasant, and soldier origin; on the other hand, they have been recruiting and assimilating, forming cliques, and placing a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in key positions throughout the school, controlling the school's power, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship. These people have been rampant and tyrannical. When students raise criticisms, some bourgeois professors have even publicly declared: "In the classroom, my words are the law!" "My course is an imperialist course, a tyrannical course!"

	Look! The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling schools is so severe, and the evil of the old education system is so shocking!

	They are able to do this because they have power. To carry out the proletarian education revolution, we must, according to the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses, not only in organization but also in politics and ideology, seize power from the capitalist roaders within the party, and completely end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling schools. We, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the new Peking University, are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist education line, and run schools according to Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the education front!

    摧毁资产阶级知识分子的统治
    新北大　萧灼基
    毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的教导，一针见血地指出了教育界的要害问题。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人，疯狂反对毛主席的革命路线，大力推行反革命修正主义教育路线，贩卖封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货。旧北大是中国赫鲁晓夫直接控制下的一个资产阶级反动堡垒。毛泽东思想的权威在北大根本没有树立起来。全校理科、语言科各系，根本没有开设毛泽东思想课。文科各系虽开设一些毛泽东思想课，但比重少得可怜，只是作为点缀罢了。相反，他们极力加强资产阶级教育，大力散布资产阶级毒素，腐蚀青年一代，为复辟资本主义服务。
    一九六○年以来，宣扬“封、资、修”的课程大大增加。例如，中国文学、汉语、古典文学、哲学、政治、法律、经济、图书馆等八个专业，共有专业基础课一百二十七门，其中浸透着封建主义毒素的“史类”课三十七门，占百分之二十九。哲学系哲学专业的专业课共四十门，其中封建主义、资本主义课程有三十门。中国哲学史方面由《论语》到《谭嗣同》共有十六门。其它乱七八糟的资产阶级货色，应有尽有。
    在陆平反革命修正主义集团的怂恿、鼓励下，资产阶级知识分子在课堂上大肆放毒。反动学术“权威”、封建遗老冯友兰，在课堂上狂热地歌颂孔子，胡说什么“孔学是新生事物，具有远大前途。”有的反动文人胡说什么“中国人之所以成为中国人，是因为有了孔子！”真是狂妄已极。
    解放以来，北大被党内走资派和资产阶级知识分子所统治，成为他们在中国复辟资本主义的一个阵地。他们一方面大肆打击和迫害工农兵出身的革命干部，一方面招降纳叛，结党营私，把一批反革命修正主义分子安插到全校各个重要岗位上去，控制全校大权，在北大实行资产阶级专政。这些家伙飞扬跋扈，横行霸道。学生对他们提意见，有的资产阶级教授甚至公开叫嚣：“在课堂上，我讲的话就是法律！”“我的课就是帝国主义课，霸道课！”
    请看！资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象多么严重，旧教育制度的罪恶是多么触目惊心啊！
    他们之所以能这样做，就是因为他们有权。进行无产阶级教育革命，就要按照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，把权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手中，不但在组织上，而且在政治上、思想上向党内走资派夺权，彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象。我们新北大革命师生员工，决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步狠批反革命修正主义教育路线，按照毛主席的“五·七”指示办学，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在教育阵地上高高飘扬！
