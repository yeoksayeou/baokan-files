The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Qingdao Steel Plant, with the help of the PLA "support-left" forces, firmly and correctly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They boldly liberated a batch of cadres, including the first-in-command, the former Party Committee Secretary Liu Hua.

The former Party Committee Secretary Liu Hua, in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, once implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. He directed the struggle against the revolutionary masses, proposing erroneous slogans such as "layer-by-layer peeling" and "individual filtering," which resulted in many revolutionary workers being attacked.

When the revolutionary masses rose up to expose the problems of the former Qingdao Municipal Committee and the factory Party Committee, Liu Hua suppressed the revolutionary actions of the masses, becoming an obstacle to the revolutionary mass movement.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, revolutionary workers bravely broke through the obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, opening up a new revolutionary situation. In this context, Liu Hua, with the help of the revolutionary masses, underwent intense ideological struggle. He made public self-criticisms to the entire factory's revolutionary workers several times, gradually recognizing his mistakes.

	Maintaining the Initiative

After the proletarian revolutionary cadres of this factory seized power, they increasingly felt that to wield power correctly, they must correctly handle cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings and absorb revolutionary leading cadres into the "three-in-one" leadership cadre. Thus, the question of whether to liberate Liu Hua was raised.

As soon as the issue was raised, the factory immediately launched a heated debate.

Some people proposed: "Liu Hua is the top leader of the factory; we can't easily liberate him. We should first liberate cadres with lower positions." What is the standard for liberating cadres? Is the standard for liberating cadres the level of their positions? No! Revolutionary comrades said: As long as a cadre's mistakes are of the nature of contradictions within the people, and they have recognized their mistakes and are determined to correct them, they should be boldly liberated, and not distinguished by the level of their positions. Using the level of positions as the standard for whether to liberate cadres is not a class analysis viewpoint, but a metaphysical viewpoint.

Some people also whispered behind the scenes: "In the past, you shouted 'overthrow Liu Hua' and 'burn Liu Hua,' and now you want to liberate Liu Hua. You're on the defensive now!" Some comrades seemed to feel guilty when they heard this. After a discussion, everyone reached a unanimous view: In the past, "burning" was correct, and today's liberation is also correct; only by burning away the mistakes and shortcomings of cadres is there the possibility of liberating them. We act according to Chairman Mao's teachings and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and we will always be in the initiative; if we do not act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we will inevitably be passive.

After clarifying some incorrect ideological understandings, everyone felt that the most important thing in deciding whether to liberate Liu Hua was to determine whether he was on the side of the proletariat.

	Providing Comprehensive Materials to the Masses

Chairman Mao taught us: "We must not only look at a cadre's temporary actions, but also at the cadre's entire history and all his work. This is the main method of identifying cadres."

Liu Hua came to the factory three years ago from the PLA, from a poor peasant family, and had suffered since childhood. He joined the revolutionary army in 1940. In the more than twenty years from being a soldier to the political commissar of a regiment, he was loyal to the Party's cause, had a firm stance, and paid attention to studying Chairman Mao's works. He had health issues, but the organization persuaded him to retire, and he insisted on continuing to work for the Party. Although he had made some mistakes in the past, his overall stance was good.

The factory Revolutionary Committee comrades, after research and analysis, decided to provide comprehensive materials about Liu Hua to the masses. They believed that to let the masses identify cadres, the masses must fully understand the cadres, and they must firmly believe that the masses are the most adept at using Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish between good and bad cadres. This material was distributed down to the work teams, and the entire factory held a big discussion. Practice proved that the factory Revolutionary Committee's approach was successful, and the workers discussed it well, ultimately reaching a unanimous conclusion: Liu Hua is not a capitalist-road element in power; he is a cadre who made mistakes, and his problems are contradictions within the people.

	Helping Cadres Step Out of the Office

To liberate Liu Hua, we must help Liu Hua liberate his mind and truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The factory Revolutionary Committee comrades admonished him: "Comrade Liu Hua, the root of your mistakes is that you have detached yourself from the masses and do not trust the masses. You must decide to go to the masses for a good 'bath.'"

Liu Hua gratefully accepted this comradely care and help.

He voluntarily went to the Thin Plate Workshop's bundling team to labor. This was his first time working in the workshop in the more than two years since he came to the factory. As a Communist Party member, he had not followed Chairman Mao's words and had not insisted on the system of cadres participating in collective labor. He deeply felt ashamed. From then on, Liu Hua labored and lived with the workers every day, studying Chairman Mao's works with them. In a short time, the distance between him and the workers shortened.

During a "three autumns" labor, while resting by the field, a group of workers gathered around him and said: "Comrade Liu Hua, you were too distant from us workers in the past. It was harder for us to talk to you than to climb to the sky. When we went to your office, we had to go through several gates. It wasn't the secretary blocking us, nor the office director not letting us in, but they always said you were busy. Busy, busy, busy, you never showed your face to the workers, what could you be busy with? You never heard a word from us workers, how could you not make mistakes!" The workers' criticism hit the mark.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres' help to Liu Hua was serious and earnest. They let Liu Hua repeatedly go to the front lines of revolutionary criticism to "show his face" and undergo the test of the stormy struggle of the masses. They organized one meeting after another of different scales, letting Liu Hua listen to the masses' analysis and criticism of his mistakes. The leaders of the factory Revolutionary Committee also often had heart-to-heart talks with him.

What moved Liu Hua the most was a heart-to-heart talk between the factory Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member, worker Jiang Chongjing, and him. Jiang Chongjing had suffered greatly in the old society; his family of three generations begged for a living. In the Cultural Revolution, he was the first to rise up in revolution. However, the bourgeois reactionary line that Liu Hua implemented subjected him to various persecutions. This time, when Comrade Jiang Chongjing voluntarily came to have a heart-to-heart talk with him, Liu Hua was initially unnatural. But Jiang Chongjing's words were warm, frank, and sincere. He said: "Comrade Liu Hua, the masses struggle against you and criticize you, not to vent personal grievances or seek revenge. We hate you for deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, for your mistakes. We want you to quickly discard your mistakes, stand up, and become Chairman Mao's true good cadre."

After speaking, Jiang Chongjing handed over the collected study materials to Liu Hua, including Chairman Mao's and the central leaders' instructions and relevant materials criticizing China's Khrushchev. He said: "I hope you will study Chairman Mao's instructions well and deeply touch your soul."

When Liu Hua received the materials from this worker who had once suffered his cruel persecution, he couldn't help but shed tears.

In the past, Liu Hua did not understand the revolutionary mass movement and was not convinced by the proletarian revolutionary cadres. He always thought he was superior to the masses in every way. What was the reality? The revolutionary cadres understood and implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line so deeply and well. After seizing power, the entire factory quickly implemented revolutionary great unity, established a revolutionary committee, and carried out a thriving revolution. Production was booming, and the first quarter's state plan was completed more than twenty days ahead of schedule. The factory presented a prosperous scene.

In the face of facts, Liu Hua was convinced by the proletarian revolutionary cadres.

	"Trust" and "Let Go"

After Liu Hua stood up, a new problem arose: how should Liu Hua be used?

Initially, some people disagreed with reusing him, reasoning that: he was originally the top leader of the factory, and letting him take on an important position again was "not reassuring." Everyone discussed that this "not reassuring" was actually "not letting go." We dare to liberate cadres, so we must dare to boldly use cadres. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we can be one hundred percent reassured. In the end, everyone unanimously agreed to absorb him into the "three-in-one" factory Revolutionary Committee and serve as a standing committee member.

Liu Hua, with boundless gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Party, took up a new post. He did not disappoint the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers' trust in him. In the meetings of the Revolutionary Committee, he actively offered suggestions and gave advice to the revolutionary youngsters. He stayed in the factory long-term, ate in the factory, and went wherever he was needed. He no longer "locked" himself in the office as he did in the past. In the workshops, in the meeting halls, and in various venues, people often saw this fifty-year-old Communist Party member breathing and fighting with the masses.

The flames of the Cultural Revolution tempered Liu Hua to be young again. Workers said: "Liu Hua has changed; he truly has more vigor as he ages." Liu Hua himself recently wrote in a big-character poster with great emotion:

"Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! After I made mistakes, it was your teachings and a series of latest instructions that gave me boundless wisdom and strength, making me stand up again and return to the revolutionary path you indicated. It is you who gave me life, it is you who gave me everything!"

### 让群众全面地识别干部  让干部到群众中去“洗澡”

    让群众全面地识别干部  让干部到群众中去“洗澡”
    ——青岛钢厂解放原党委书记的前后
    青岛钢厂无产阶级革命派，在解放军“支左”部队的帮助下，坚定而正确地执行了毛主席的干部政策，大胆地解放了一批干部，其中包括第一把手、原党委书记刘华同志。
    原党委书记刘华，在文化大革命初期一度执行了资产阶级反动路线。他把斗争矛头指向革命群众，提出了什么“层层剥皮”、“逐个过滤”等错误口号，使不少革命职工受到了打击。
    当革命群众奋起揭发原青岛市委和工厂党委的问题时，刘华又压制了群众的革命行动，成了革命群众运动的绊脚石。
    在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，革命工人勇敢地起来冲破了资产阶级反动路线的阻挡，打开了革命的新局面。在这种情况下，刘华经过革命群众的帮助，经历了激烈的思想斗争，多次向全厂革命职工作了公开检讨，逐步认识了自己的错误。
                       主动和被动
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派夺权以后，越来越感觉到要掌好权用好权，就要按照毛主席的教导正确地对待干部，把革命的领导干部吸收到“三结合”的领导班子中来。于是，能不能解放刘华的问题就提到了日程上来了。
    问题一提出，厂里立即展开了一场激烈的争论。
    有人提出：“刘华是工厂的第一把手，不能轻易解放他，得先解放职位比他低的干部。”解放干部的标准是什么？难道职位高低是解放干部的标准？不对！革命派同志说：只要这个干部错误的性质是属于人民内部矛盾，对错误也有了认识，并决心改正，就应当大胆解放，而不应当以职位高低来区分解放的先后。拿职位高低作为能不能解放干部的标准，这不是阶级分析的观点，而是形而上学的观点。
    也有一些人在背后冷言冷语地说：“过去你们高喊打倒刘华、“火烧”刘华，现在又要解放刘华，你们被动啦！”有些同志听了也似乎觉得理亏了。经过一番讨论，大家得出了一致看法：过去“火烧”是对的，今天解放也是对的；烧掉了干部的错误和缺点，才有解放他们的可能。我们按照毛主席的教导去做，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就永远主动；不按毛主席的教导去做，就必然被动。
    在澄清了一些不正确的思想认识以后，大家认为，能不能解放刘华，最重要的还是要弄清他究竟是哪个司令部的人。
                    把全面材料告诉群众
    毛主席教导我们说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”
    刘华是三年前从解放军转业来的，贫农家庭出身，从小受苦，一九四○年就参加了革命部队。从当战士到团的政治委员的二十多年中，他对党的事业忠心耿耿，立场坚定，注意学习毛主席著作。他身体有病，组织上劝他退休，他却坚持要继续为党工作。虽然他过去也有过一些错误，但大节是好的。
    工厂革委会的同志经过研究分析，决定把有关刘华的全面材料告诉群众。他们认为，要让群众来识别干部，就要让群众全面了解干部，应当坚信群众是最善于运用毛泽东思想区分干部的好坏的。这份材料一直发到了班组，全厂展开了大讨论。实践证明，厂革委会的这个做法是成功的，工人们讨论得很好，最后得出了一致的结论：刘华不是走资本主义道路的当权派，他是一个犯了错误的干部，他的问题是人民内部的矛盾。
                     帮助干部走出办公室
    要解放刘华，就得帮助刘华解放思想，使他真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来。厂革命委员会的同志忠告他：“刘华同志，你犯错误的根源就是脱离群众，不信任群众，你要下决心到群众中去好好‘洗洗澡’。”
    刘华以感激的心情接受了这种同志式的关怀和帮助。
    他主动到薄板车间捆装组参加劳动。这是他来工厂两年多第一次下车间劳动。作为一个共产党员，过去他没有听毛主席的话，没有坚持干部参加集体劳动的制度，他深深地感到惭愧。从此，刘华每天和工人们劳动在一起，生活在一起，和工人们一起学习毛主席著作。不长的时间里，他跟工人的距离缩短了。
    在一次“三秋”劳动中，在地边休息的时候，一群工人围着他说：“刘华同志啊，你过去离我们工人太远啦，我们要跟你说句话比登天还难，到办公室找你，要过几道关，不是秘书挡驾，就是办公室主任不让，总是说你忙。忙，忙，忙，你成天不见工人的面，能忙出个啥名堂来？你耳朵里整天听不到咱工人的一句话，哪能不犯错误！”工人们的批评，击中了他的要害。
    无产阶级革命派对刘华的帮助是严肃的、认真的。他们让刘华一再到革命大批判的火线上去“亮相”，去经受群众斗争大风雨的考验。他们组织了一次又一次不同规模的会议，让刘华听取群众对他的错误进行的分析和批判。厂革命委员会的领导成员，也经常找他促膝谈心。
    使刘华最激动的是厂革委会常委、工人江崇敬和他的一次谈心。江崇敬在旧社会里饱受苦难，他家三代要饭过活。在文化大革命中，他最先起来闹革命。但是，刘华所执行的资产阶级反动路线却使他遭受了种种迫害。这次，当江崇敬同志主动走来找他谈心的时候，刘华开始很不自然。但江崇敬的谈话却是热情的、坦率的、真挚的。他说：“刘华同志，群众斗你，批你，不是泄私愤，图报复。我们恨你，是恨你离开了毛主席的革命路线，是恨你的错误。我们要你快些丢掉错误，站起来，成为毛主席的真正的好干部。”
    说罢，江崇敬把搜集来的十几份学习材料递给了刘华，其中有毛主席和中央首长的指示，有批判中国赫鲁晓夫的有关资料。他说：“希望你好好学习毛主席的指示，狠狠触及自己的灵魂。”
    当刘华从这个曾经遭受过他残酷打击的工人手里接过材料的时候，忍不住流下了眼泪。
    过去，刘华对革命的群众运动不理解，对无产阶级革命派不服气。他总以为自己什么都比群众高明。事实呢？革命派对毛主席的革命路线领会得那么深，执行得那么好。在掌权以后，全厂迅速实行了革命大联合，建立了革命委员会，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上，第一季度提前二十多天完成了国家计划，工厂出现了一片兴旺景象。
    在事实面前，刘华对无产阶级革命派信服了。
                  “放心”和“放手”
    刘华站出来以后，一个新问题又来到面前：应当怎样使用刘华？
    最初，有人不同意重用他，理由是：他原是工厂的第一把手，让他再担任要职“不放心”。大家议论说：这种“不放心”，其实就是“不放手”。我们既敢于解放干部，就要敢于大胆使用干部。只要按照毛主席的教导去做，可以一百个放心。最后，大家就一致同意吸收他参加“三结合”的厂革命委员会，担任常委。
    刘华带着对毛主席和党的无限感激之情，走上了新的战斗岗位。他没有辜负革命派和革命职工对他的信任，在革命委员会的会议上，他积极地提意见，为革命小将们出主意。他长期住在厂里，吃在厂里，哪里需要他，他就赶到哪里去。他再也不象过去那样把自己“锁”在办公室里了。在车间里，在会场上，在各种场合，人们经常看到这位五十岁的共产党员和群众呼吸在一起，战斗在一起。
    文化大革命的烈火，把刘华锻炼得年轻了。工人们说：“刘华变啦，他真是越老劲越足了。”刘华自己也在最近的一张大字报里满怀激情地写道：
    “毛主席啊，毛主席！在我犯了错误以后，是您老人家的教导和一系列最新指示给我增添了无穷的智慧和力量，使我重新站起来，回到您老人家所指引的革命道路上来，是您给了我生命，是您给了我一切！”
