The stars in the sky had not yet faded, and the first tram of Hanoi had just left the station. The entire unit of Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company 1, tasked with defending the capital, had already lined up in front of a flower bed with the words "Defend the Motherland to the Death." Political instructor Phan Chinh Yen stood at the front of the formation and indignantly said, "The Sword Lake Tram Station, the Xuan Dieu Bus Station, the flower kiosk in front of the Temple of Jade Mountain, and many streets in Hanoi such as Hang Bac Street and Hang Duong Street have all been destroyed by American bombs. Comrades, we must remember this new debt of blood from the American bandits..."

The political instructor's words had not yet finished when the entire company of soldiers unanimously declared with iron will: "Avenge Hanoi! Defend the motherland to the death!"

At noon, when the sun was at its hottest, Company Commander Nguyen Huy Kien stood on a mound in the middle of the position, observing the sky. At this moment, the observer reported the discovery of targets: six to seven batches of American bandit planes were flying towards Hanoi. Nguyen Huy Kien, from the observer's report, anticipated that a fierce battle was imminent.

The enemy planes arrived! With a command from the company commander, the guns quickly turned, locked onto the targets, and fired fiercely. The first volley of shells shot down one American bandit plane.

The observer continuously reported the enemy plane's situation: the cunning enemy came from different directions and altitudes... One plane first dove down, almost brushing against a factory building, then quickly rose and flew outwards, attempting to draw the counterattack fire away. However, the tricks played by the enemy planes could not deceive the alert and calm soldiers of Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company 1.

After a brief moment of calm in the sky, other enemy planes began to enter the fire net. Nguyen Huy Kien ordered the entire company, "Let them come in, chase them tightly, and aim calmly..." Four bandit planes flew in from different altitudes. Gunners A Nhien and A Hiep quickly turned the gun barrels, tightly aiming at the enemy planes without letting go.

Nguyen Huy Kien blew the command whistle, and the flags waved down, with all guns firing in unison. The first volley of shells hit a plane that had just started to dive. This plane did not have time to drop its bombs, and its tail caught fire. It frantically attempted to escape but was pursued by shell after shell, blown to pieces, and crashed near the position.

Under the brave counterattack of the military and people of Hanoi, the enemy's repeated attacks were all thwarted. Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company 1 shot down three enemy planes that day, achieving new military feats.

The entire unit of Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company 1 fought bravely and tenaciously in the battle. Political instructor Phan Chinh Yen was knocked down by the shockwave of a heavy bomb explosion but immediately stood up and issued a powerful command to the soldiers: "Fight bravely! Aim calmly and fire!" Observer Tran Quang Dat, from Ba Dinh District, Hanoi, had a shrapnel piece graze his shoulder, tearing his shirt, but he remained steadfast, continuing to observe the enemy situation. Gunner Nguyen Dat, with his right hand injured and bleeding, did not leave his post for a single minute.

When the sun set, the soldiers of Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company 1 had already cleaned their gun barrels, ready to face new battles.

    严惩美国强盗　誓死保卫祖国
    ——记高炮一连战士们英勇战斗的一天
    天上的星星还没有消逝，河内市第一辆有轨电车刚刚从总站里开出来，保卫首都的高炮一连全体指战员早已列队站在种成“誓死保卫祖国”字样的花圃前。连指导员范俊菴站在队伍前面愤慨地说：“还剑湖电车站、行灰街汽车站、玉山寺前的卖花小亭以及行银街、行帆街等河内市的许多条街道，都遭到美国炸弹的破坏。同志们要牢牢记住美国强盗的这笔新血债……”。
    指导员的话还没有说完，全连战士同声发出了钢铁般的誓言：“为河内报仇！誓死保卫祖国！”
    中午，这是一天中阳光最炽烈的时候。连长阮辉景站在阵地中间的土堆上，对空中进行观察。就在这时，观测员报告发现目标：六、七批美国强盗飞机正在飞向河内。阮辉景从观测员的报告中，预料到将会有一场激烈的战斗。
    敌机来到了！ 连长一声令下，各门炮迅速转动，捕捉住目标，猛烈开火，第一轮炮弹就击落美国强盗飞机一架。
    观测员不断报告敌机的情况：狡猾的敌人从不同的方向，不同的高度飞过来……。一架敌机先是俯冲下来，几乎擦着一所工厂的房子，然后又急速上升，向外围飞去，企图把还击的火力吸引过去。但是，敌机玩弄的这番诡计却骗不了机智沉着的高炮一连战士。
    天空平静了片刻之后，其他敌机开始闯进火网。阮辉景向全连战士发出命令：“让它们进来，紧紧追捕，沉着地瞄准……”。四架强盗飞机从不同的高度飞过来，炮兵阿壬和阿协迅速转动炮口，紧紧瞄住敌机不放。
    阮辉景吹响了指挥哨子，一支支小旗向下挥动，各炮齐鸣，又是第一轮炮弹就击中一架刚开始俯冲的敌机。这架敌机还没有来得及投弹，尾巴就起火了，它慌张地企图逃跑。但一发发炮弹追住它，把它打得粉身碎骨，坠落在离阵地不远的地方。
    在河内军民英勇的反击下，敌人的一次次进攻全被粉碎了。高炮一连在这天共打下三架敌机，立下了新的战功。
    高炮一连的全体指战员在战斗中表现得十分英勇顽强。连指导员范俊菴被一颗重型炸弹爆炸的气浪推倒，但他马上站起来，向战士们发出有力的命令：“英勇战斗！沉着地打！”观测员陈光得，是河内市巴亭区人，一块弹片从他的肩上擦过，把上衣撕破了，但他仍然屹立不动，坚持在那里观察敌情。炮兵班长阮达代，右手受伤流血，但他一分钟也没有离开自己的战斗岗位。
    当太阳下山的时候，高炮一连的战士们已经把自己的炮筒擦拭干净，准备迎接新的战斗。
