Title: The Wail of a Fly Hitting the Wall – A Critique of Simonov's *The Living and the Dead*

Among the Soviet revisionist writers, there is one named Simonov who wrote an anti-revolutionary novel titled *The Living and the Dead*, which maliciously curses the great Patriotic War. The propagandists of the Soviet revisionist literary world have been chirping and cheering, exclaiming that this book "clearly sings a new tune" and "reveals the truth of war," and so on.

What exactly is the "new tune" that Simonov sings and what "truth of war" does he write about? From the very first page of *The Living and the Dead*, one can hear Simonov's lamentations about how war brings disaster and destroys everything: "War is unfortunate," "War is the epitome of evil," "Every day thousands of people lose their heads," "How many people do not live to see the end," "Shells do not specify which are accidental and which are deliberate," and so on. He goes on and on, making a racket without end.

Behind these curses about war, Simonov goes on to exaggerate what he calls the "terrifying truth of war": "red thick blood," "bloody faces," "a leg severed at the knee," "tattered uniforms and mutilated bodies," "houses blown to smithereens," "trees in the garden blasted like matchsticks." The result of war is "a smoky wasteland" plus "death and hunger"!

Simonov's "new tune" boils down to one sentence: War destroys everything. In his view, in war, humanity has no struggle between justice and injustice, revolution and counter-revolution, but only the contradiction between life and death. Humanity does not need to be divided into classes, but should be divided into "the living and the dead"—this is the malicious intent behind the book's title. Either everyone should not have war and live as "the living," or everyone should perish together in war as "the dead." Since people "want to live so much," they should all "live on." Therefore, all wars should be opposed. This is Simonov's conclusion.

When Soviet critics were cheering for *The Living and the Dead*, they couldn't help but say that the appearance of this "new tune" should be sought in the "various events of our time after the 20th Congress of the CPSU." This is a clear admission. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Khrushchev came to power, and the United States and the Soviet Union jointly opened a "Soviet-American cooperation to rule the world" black business. The Khrushchev clique acted as accomplices to the tiger, engaging in black-market deals to betray the world revolution, becoming the number one accomplice of the U.S. imperialists in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people around the world. Khrushchev bared his teeth and threatened the revolutionary people, saying that they were not allowed to engage in armed struggle, that "atomic bombs do not follow class principles," that "any small 'local war' will become the spark that ignites a world war," that it "will destroy the earth," and that "the socialist issue will not exist at all, because their bodies will have been annihilated from our planet." The Khrushchev clique used the fallacy that war destroys everything to oppose the people's revolution and revolutionary war. The "new tune" of *The Living and the Dead* is nothing more than a joint performance directed by the American boss, played by Khrushchev, and blown by Simonov, to intimidate the revolutionary people, prevent the people from revolution, and prevent the people from waging revolutionary war!

Upon closer examination, Simonov's "new tune" is really not new at all. The old revisionist Kautsky and his ilk had long ago threatened the revolutionary people, saying that war "will completely destroy everything," "leaving only smoking ruins and rotting corpses," and that "no war is not a misfortune." He opposed analyzing "which wars are beneficial and which are harmful"; he advocated "you live, let others live too," begging for imperialist peace. Comparing *The Living and the Dead*, Simonov's "new tune" even has similar language to Kautsky's!

So, is Simonov's specially sung "new tune" really revealing some "truth of war"? Absolutely not!

"War is the continuation of politics by other means"—this is the truth of war.

"In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, without which the leap in social development cannot be completed, and the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain power."—this is the truth of revolutionary war.

"Historical wars can be divided into two types, one is just, and the other is unjust. ... We communists oppose all wars that hinder progress and are unjust, but we do not oppose progressive and just wars. For the latter type of war, we communists not only do not oppose it, but actively participate in it."—this is the only correct attitude of revolutionaries towards war.

Chairman Mao's teachings are immutable truths. It was precisely the October Revolution that created the world's first socialist country; it was the great Patriotic War that defended the Soviet Union and defeated Hitler. Our great motherland was also born in the fires of revolutionary war. "The whole world can only be transformed by the gun!" Revolutionary war destroys only the old system that eats people, and at the same time, it will enable the proletariat to obtain the whole world!

Simonov completely distorts history, tramples on facts, and what he says is not the "truth," but a deceptive "illusion." Of course, revolution will have sacrifices. Simonov does not talk about the political purpose of war at all, does not distinguish between just and unjust wars, revolutionary wars and counter-revolutionary wars, and tries to use the sacrifices of a few people in war and the massacres of the reactionaries to intimidate the people not to revolt. This is a pipe dream!

At a time when the people of the world are increasingly understanding that only through revolutionary war can they achieve thorough liberation, Simonov's advocacy of the theory that war destroys everything is essentially a opposition to all revolutionary wars, a prohibition on the people's revolution, and an attempt to force the people of the world to be slaves generation after generation, in order to cater to the needs of American imperialism to enslave the people of the world. However, the wheel of revolutionary war is still turning rapidly, and Simonov's so-called "new tune" is nothing more than the wails of a fly hitting the wall!

    碰壁苍蝇的抽泣
    ——评西蒙诺夫的《生者与死者》
    解放军某部五好战士　胜文
    苏修文人中有个叫西蒙诺夫的，写了一本恶毒咒骂伟大的卫国战争的反革命小说《生者与死者》。苏修文坛的吹鼓手们为此叽叽喳喳，欢呼雀跃，大叫这本书对战争“明显地唱起新的调子”，写出了“战争的真相”等等。
    究竟西蒙诺夫唱了什么“新调子”，写了什么“战争的真相”？从《生者与死者》的第一页开始，就可以听到西蒙诺夫咒骂战争带来灾难，战争毁灭一切的哀鸣：什么“战争是不幸的”，“战争就是万恶的生活”呀，什么“每天成千上万的人掉脑袋”，“有多少人活不到头”呀，什么“炮弹上并没有写明哪一个是偶然的，哪一个是专门的”，反正掉下来“一切都完了”呀，……絮絮聒聒，鼓噪个没完。
    在这些诅咒战争的“新调子”后面，西蒙诺夫又大肆渲染所谓“非常可怕”的“战争真相”：什么“红色的稠血”，“血淋淋的面孔”，“一只从膝头断掉的脚”，“军服碎片和残缺不全的人体”，什么房子“炸得粉碎”，“花园的树木被炸得象火柴棍”……战争的结果就是“剩下一块烟尘弥漫的空地”加上“死亡和饥饿”！
    西蒙诺夫的“新调子”就是一句话：战争毁灭一切。在他看来，人类在战争中，没有正义与非正义、革命与反革命的斗争，而只有生与死的矛盾；人类不必要再划分为阶级，而应当划分为“生者与死者”——这就是书名的恶毒用心所在。要末大家都不要战争，当个“生者”，要末大家在战争中同归于尽，当个“死者”；而人“是多么愿意活着”，也都“应该活下去”，所以要反对一切战争。——这就是西蒙诺夫的结论。
    苏修评论家们在为《生者与死者》捧场喝采时情不自禁地说，出现这种“新调子”，要“在苏共二十大后”，“在我们当代的各种事件里寻找原因”。真是不打自招。苏共二十大以后，赫鲁晓夫上台，美苏两家合伙开起“苏美合作主宰世界”的黑公司。赫鲁晓夫之流为虎作伥，大做叛卖世界革命的黑市交易，成了美帝镇压世界人民革命斗争的头号帮凶。赫鲁晓夫呲牙咧嘴地威吓革命人民不准搞武装斗争，说什么“原子弹不遵循阶级原则”，“任何一个小小的‘局部战争’都会成为引起世界大战的火灾的星星之火”，“将会毁灭地球”，“社会主义问题就根本不存在了，因为他们的肉体已经从我们的星球上消灭了”。赫鲁晓夫之流，就是用战争毁灭一切的谬论来反对人民革命，反对革命战争的。《生者与死者》的“新调子”，不过是美国老爷指挥，赫鲁晓夫按孔，西蒙诺夫吹气，合伙奏出来的恫吓革命人民，不准人民革命，不准人民发动革命战争的反革命嚎叫罢了！
    细细查来，西蒙诺夫的“新调子”也实在不新。老修正主义者考茨基之流早就恐吓革命人民，说战争“要彻底摧毁一切”，“留下的仅仅是冒烟的废墟和腐烂的尸体”，“没有一次战争不是一种不幸”。他反对分析“哪些战争有益，哪些战争有害”；他鼓吹“你活，让别人也活”，乞求帝国主义恩赐和平。对照一下《生者与死者》，西蒙诺夫的“新调子”连语言都跟考茨基差不多！
    那末，西蒙诺夫大唱特唱的“新调子”，难道真是写出了什么“战争的真相”吗？绝对不是！
    “战争是流血的政治”——这才是战争的真相。
      “在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”——这才是革命战争的真相。
      “历史上的战争分为两类，一类是正义的，一类是非正义的。……我们共产党人反对一切阻碍进步的非正义的战争，但是不反对进步的正义的战争。对于后一类战争，我们共产党人不但不反对，而且积极地参加”。——这才是革命者对待战争唯一正确的态度。
    毛主席的教导是颠扑不破的真理。正是十月革命战争，缔造了世界上第一个社会主义国家；正是伟大的卫国战争保卫了苏联，打败了希特勒。我们伟大的祖国也是在革命战争的烈火中诞生的。“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造”！革命战争毁灭的只是吃人的旧制度，与此同时，它将使无产阶级得到整个世界！
    西蒙诺夫完全颠倒了历史，践踏了事实，他说的不是“真相”，而是欺人的“假象”。当然，要革命就会有牺牲。西蒙诺夫根本不谈战争的政治目的，根本不分正义战争还是非正义战争，革命战争还是反革命战争，妄图用战争中少数人的牺牲和反动派的屠杀来胁迫人民不起来革命，这是白日做梦！
    在世界人民愈来愈懂得只有通过革命战争才能获得彻底解放的今天，西蒙诺夫鼓吹战争毁灭一切论，实质上就是反对一切革命战争，不准人民革命，企图强迫世界人民世世代代做牛马，以迎合美帝国主义奴役世界人民的需要。然而，革命战争的巨轮依然在飞转，西蒙诺夫的所谓“新调子”，不过是碰壁苍蝇的几声抽泣罢了！
