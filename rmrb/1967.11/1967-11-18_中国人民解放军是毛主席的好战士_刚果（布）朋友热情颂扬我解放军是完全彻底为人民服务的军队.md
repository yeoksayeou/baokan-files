Some Congolese (Brazzaville) friends who have visited China recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Brazzaville, enthusiastically praising the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which was personally founded and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, as a completely new type of, unparalleled, and thoroughly people-serving people's army armed with boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

A member of the civil defense team named Masamuna said: I have never seen such an army. It compares itself to a fish and the masses to water, never leaving the masses for a moment, completely immersing itself among the people, and thoroughly serving the people. A friend named Gabriel said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army always shares joys and sorrows with the masses and has a heart-to-heart connection with them. Therefore, it has won the enthusiastic love and support of the broad masses of the people. The relationship between the army and the people is intimate and united as one.

Another civil defense team member, Buwanduo Morris, loudly read a quote from Chairman Mao: "The army must unite with the people, so that the people see the army as their own. Such an army is invincible in the world..." He sighed and said: Only after personally interacting with the Chinese People's Liberation Army did I understand what kind of army can truly be called a people's army.

Buwanduo Morris highly praised the officer-soldier relationship in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said: In my interactions with the soldiers of the Liberation Army, what surprised me the most was that one could not tell who was the commander and who was the soldier. They are completely equal, respecting, caring for, loving, and helping each other.

He continued: This is because they all come from the people, are the people's children, and are Chairman Mao's good soldiers.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) friends also highly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army as "a armed group that executes revolutionary political tasks." Masamuna said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly responds to Chairman Mao's great call for the "People's Liberation Army to be a great school." When talking about his visit to a unit in Beijing, he said: The officers and soldiers of this unit actively participate in labor and production. This is a remarkable thing. Only an army armed with Mao Zedong Thought can achieve this.

Congolese (Brazzaville) friend Gabriel pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a fighting army and a labor army but also a propaganda army.

He said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army responds to Chairman Mao's call and actively participates in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Whether in people's communes or factories, one can see soldiers of the Liberation Army organizing the masses to "seize the revolution and promote production," helping the masses study Chairman Mao's works, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. He emphasized: The People's Liberation Army has achieved great results in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training.

Congolese (Brazzaville) friend Masamba Batiste said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an invincible army in the world. No force in the world can defeat it; it can only be defeated by it. Because the Chinese People's Liberation Army not only has atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs but also has an invincible spiritual atomic bomb—the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said: Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and reliable ideological weapon for revolutionary people. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest combat effectiveness and are therefore invincible in the world. He also said: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a completely new type of people's army, a people's army that the people can completely rely on. There is no army in the world today that can compare with it.

These Congolese (Brazzaville) friends all agreed: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the best example for all revolutionary armies to learn from. The path of growth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the path that every revolutionary people's army should follow.

    中国人民解放军是毛主席的好战士
    刚果（布）朋友热情颂扬我解放军是完全彻底为人民服务的军队
    新华社布拉柴维尔电　一些访问过中国的刚果（布）朋友最近在布拉柴维尔对新华社记者发表谈话时，热情赞扬由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的中国人民解放军，是一支用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的完全新型的、举世无双的、完全彻底为人民服务的人民军队。
    一位名叫马萨穆纳的民防团战士说：我从来没有见过这样一支军队，它把自己比作鱼，把群众看作水，一时一刻也不脱离群众，完全深入到群众中去，与人民群众打成一片，完全彻底地为人民群众服务。一位名叫加布里尔的朋友说：中国人民解放军永远与群众同甘苦，与群众心连心，因此它得到了广大人民群众的热烈爱戴和拥护。军民关系亲密无间，团结得象一个人一样。另一位民防团战士布万多·莫里斯高声朗读了毛主席的一段语录：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，……”他感慨地说：在我亲身与中国人民解放军相处之后，我才懂得了什么样的军队，才能称得起是人民的军队。
    布万多·莫里斯高度评价了中国人民解放军的官兵关系，他说：在我与解放军战士的接触中，感到最惊奇的是：人们根本看不出他们中间谁是指挥员，谁是战斗员。他们完全是平等关系，他们互相尊重，互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。
    他接着说：这是因为他们都是来自人民，是人民的子弟兵，是毛主席的好战士。
    刚果（布）朋友们还对中国人民解放军“是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”给予了高度评价。马萨穆纳说：中国人民解放军坚决响应毛主席关于“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召。他在谈到他参观了在北京的一支部队的时候说：这支部队的指战员积极参加劳动生产。这是一件了不起的事情。这只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队才能做到。
    刚果（布）朋友加布里尔指出，中国人民解放军不仅是一支战斗大军，劳动大军，还是一支宣传大军。
    他说：中国人民解放军响应毛主席的号召，积极参加了无产阶级文化大革命。无论在人民公社或工厂里，到处可以看到解放军战士在那里组织群众进行“抓革命，促生产”，帮助群众学习毛主席著作，向群众宣传毛泽东思想。他强调说：人民解放军在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等工作中取得了巨大的成绩。
    刚果朋友马桑巴·巴蒂斯特说：中国人民解放军是一支无敌于天下的军队，世界上任何力量也不能压倒它，而只能被它所压倒。因为中国人民解放军不仅有原子弹、氢弹，还有一个战无不胜的精神原子弹——伟大的毛泽东思想。他说：毛泽东思想是革命人民威力最大最可靠的思想武器，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人有最大的战斗力，因此他们是天下无敌的。他还说：中国人民解放军是一支完全新型的人民军队，是一支人民群众完全可以信赖的自己的军队，当今世界上没有任何一支军队能与它相比拟。
    这些刚果（布）朋友都一致认为：中国人民解放军是一切革命军队学习的最好榜样，中国人民解放军成长的道路就是每支革命人民军队都要遵循的道路。
