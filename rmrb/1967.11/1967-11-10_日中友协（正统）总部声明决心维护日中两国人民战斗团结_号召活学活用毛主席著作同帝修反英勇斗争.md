The headquarters of the (Genuine) Japan-China Friendship Association, which hoists the banner of Japan-China friendship, issued a statement on October 30, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of this organization, stating: We will study and apply Chairman Mao's works, bravely fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, resolutely smash the Japan Communist Party's Miyamoto clique, which has degenerated into revisionism, and its puppet organization, the pseudo-Japan-China Friendship Association, and strive to further consolidate the fighting solidarity of the peoples of Japan and China.

The statement condemns the anti-China activities of the Japan Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique and reaffirms the joint statement issued by the representatives of the Japan-China Friendship Association in Beijing on October 12, 1966, which correctly expresses the fighting will of the Japanese people to oppose the anti-China activities of the Japan Communist Party's Miyamoto clique and to hope for Japan-China friendship.

The statement discusses how, when the Japan Communist Party's Miyamoto clique attempted to violently sabotage the joint statement, the majority of the people who united under the banner of the headquarters of the (Genuine) Japan-China Friendship Association fought unyieldingly and bravely to maintain Japan-China friendship. Through their struggle, they have rallied more people who hope for Japan-China friendship under the banner of the headquarters of the (Genuine) Japan-China Friendship Association.

The statement also points out that, at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing to victory, and when the desperate and cornered U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism, with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique as its core, are launching anti-China activities internationally, the Sato government and the Japan Communist Party revisionists are even more blatantly carrying out anti-China activities. However, their anti-China actions are encountering increasingly strong opposition among the Japanese people.

The statement strongly condemns the Japan Communist Party's Miyamoto clique for its frenzied attacks on the seven hundred million people of China and the great leader Mao Zedong, who is revered by the people of the world.

The statement emphasizes that the current international and domestic situation in Japan is very favorable for the struggle of the Japanese people. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the decisive force in this favorable situation, greatly inspiring and encouraging the people of all countries in the world.

    日中友协（正统）总部声明决心维护日中两国人民战斗团结
    号召活学活用毛主席著作同帝修反英勇斗争
    新华社东京电　高举日中友好旗帜的日中友好协会（正统）总部十月三十日，在这个组织成立一周年的时候发表声明表示：要活学活用毛主席著作，勇敢地同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争，坚决粉碎堕落为修正主义的日共宫本集团及其操纵下的伪日中友协组织，为进一步巩固日中两国人民的战斗团结而奋斗。
    声明谴责日共宫本修正主义集团的反华活动，重申一九六六年十月十二日，日中两国友好协会代表团在北京发表的共同声明，正确地表达了日本人民反对日共宫本集团的反华活动、期望日中友好的战斗意志。
    声明谈到了在日共宫本集团妄图以暴力来破坏共同声明的时候，团结在日中友好协会（正统）总部中的大多数人民，为维护日中友好而进行的不屈不挠的勇敢斗争。他们通过斗争，把更多期望日中友好的人们团结在日中友好协会（正统）总部的旗帜之下。
    声明还指出，正当中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进，而走投无路、陷于绝境的美帝国主义、各国反动派和以苏修统治集团为核心的现代修正主义，在国际上掀起反华活动的时候，佐藤政府和日共修正主义分子也变本加厉地进行露骨的反华活动。但是，它们的反华行径，在日本人民中间正在遭到越来越强烈的反对。
    声明强烈谴责日共宫本集团疯狂地攻击中国七亿人民和世界人民心中最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    声明着重指出，目前国际和日本国内，处于一派大好形势，对日本人民的斗争非常有利。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利是这种大好形势的决定力量，它极大地鼓舞和激励了世界各国人民。
