At this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest directives on the proletarian education revolution. This is not only a great encouragement and support for the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in schools, but also a great encouragement and spur for us, the broad masses of revolutionary workers. We firmly support Chairman Mao's latest directives and are determined to follow them to the letter. We will definitely make the greatest contributions to the establishment of a proletarian education system.

In late October, over a hundred revolutionary teachers and students from Tongji University brought their "May 7th" Commune educational revolution plan to our construction site for trial implementation. They worked and fought alongside the workers, criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, conducted investigations and research, and sought our opinions on the educational revolution. This was warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses on our construction site. We believe that although the "May 7th" Commune educational revolution plan is only an initial proposal and is not yet perfect, it still needs to be tested in practice, but we feel that the students' general direction is correct, and this path is the right one! We firmly support it!

The three of us have different experiences. One is an old construction worker with over thirty years of work experience, one is a technical staff member who graduated from Tongji University in 1958 and has worked on construction sites for several years, and one is a designer who has worked for over a decade and then graduated from a part-time architectural college. Based on our different experiences and years of practice, we deeply feel that the old educational system, old teaching principles, and methods must be thoroughly reformed. The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue. The counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by the capitalist-roaders in the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, aims to restore capitalism. Schools run according to this line can never cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the past, we have also encountered such university students who, after reading many books in school, could do nothing when they came to the construction site; they thought they had knowledge and did not want to get close to the workers. Some of them were full of bourgeois ideas, looked down on the working people, and only wanted to be engineers, not to work hard, and even cursed us construction workers as "stinking mud masons." Seeing these phenomena, we hated the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev and the old educational system.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great "May 7th" Directive. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Students are also like this. They should focus on learning but also learn other things, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive is the only correct guideline for the educational revolution. Only by following Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive can we fundamentally reform the old educational system and turn our schools into red bastions of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." Chairman Mao's latest directive is not only a battle cry to the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in schools but also a battle call to us, the broad revolutionary masses. Schools have always been one of the places where the struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads are the most intense. The educational revolution is a major issue concerning the cultivation of proletarian revolutionary successors and the thorough implementation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The educational revolution is a revolution of the masses. The revolutionary Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in schools should be the vanguards and pioneers of the educational revolution. We, the broad revolutionary masses, should also actively participate in this great revolution. We should unite with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in schools and fight together to achieve a thorough victory in the educational revolution.

The educational revolution is a broad social reform. Now, the revolutionary teachers and students of Tongji University are conducting a trial of the educational revolution on our construction site, integrating teaching, design, and construction. Our construction site and design institute must also make corresponding reforms; otherwise, we cannot meet the needs of the educational revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us in the "May 7th" Directive: "Workers should focus on work but also learn military affairs, politics, and culture, and also carry out socialist educational movements and criticize the bourgeoisie. In places with conditions, they should also engage in agricultural and sideline production, such as the Daqing Oil Field." Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive is also our fighting program for revolutionizing the industrial sector and turning factories and enterprises into red bastions of Mao Zedong Thought. We must learn from the revolutionary Red Guards, carry forward the bold, daring, and revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, deeply carry out the great criticism, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform of our units. We will turn our construction site into a red bastion of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 为建立无产阶级教育制度贡献力量

    为建立无产阶级教育制度贡献力量
    上海市建筑公司二零五工地工人　黄阿春
    二零五工地技术员　王允恭
    华东工业设计院技术员　尤海涌
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，传来了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，这不仅是对学校广大革命红卫兵小将和革命师生员工的支持和鼓舞，也是对我们广大革命职工最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！我们坚决拥护毛主席的最新指示，决心句句照办，字字照办，一定要为建立无产阶级教育制度作出最大的贡献。
    十月下旬，同济大学的一百多个革命师生，带着他们“五·七”公社的教育革命方案，来到我们二零五工地进行试点。他们和工人们一起劳动，一起战斗，批判反革命修正主义的教育路线，进行调查研究，征求我们对教育革命的意见，受到我们工地上广大革命职工的欢迎。我们觉得，“五·七”公社的教育革命方案，虽然只是初步的设想，还不完善，更有待于实践的检验，但我们觉得同学们的大方向是正确的，这条路走对了！我们坚决支持！
    我们三个人，一个是已经有了三十多年工龄的老建筑工人，一个是一九五八年从同济大学毕业经过几年工作的工地技术员，一个是工作了十多年然后又从业余建筑学院毕业的设计人员。我们根据自己不同的经历，在多年的实践中，深深体会到，旧的教育制度，旧的教学方针和方法，必须彻底改革，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，目的是为了复辟资本主义。按照这条路线办的学校，根本不可能培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。过去我们也接触过这样一些大学生，他们在学校里读了许多书，可是到了工地，啥也做不来；他们自以为有知识，不愿意和工人接近。他们当中有的人满脑子资产阶级思想，看不起劳动人民，一心只想当工程师，不想好好劳动，甚至骂我们建筑工人是“臭泥水匠”。看到这些现象，我们对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线以及旧的教育制度恨透了。
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大领袖毛主席发出了伟大的“五·七”指示。毛主席教导我们：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的“五·七”指示，是教育革命唯一正确的纲领。只有根据毛主席的“五·七”指示办事，才能根本改革旧的教育制度，才能把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    毛主席最近又教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席的这一最新指示，不仅是对学校中广大革命师生员工发出的战斗动员令，也是向我们广大革命职工发出的战斗号令。学校从来就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最激烈的场所之一。教育革命是关系到培养无产阶级革命接班人的大事，是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事。教育革命是群众的革命。学校的革命红卫兵、革命师生员工要作教育革命的闯将、先锋，我们广大革命职工也应当积极参加这个伟大的革命。我们要和学校的广大革命师生员工团结在一起，战斗在一起，夺取教育革命的彻底胜利。
    教育革命是一项广泛的社会改革。现在同济大学的革命师生在我们工地进行教学、设计和施工三位一体的教育革命试点，我们建筑工地、设计院也一定要作相应的改革，否则就不能适应教育革命的需要。毛主席在“五·七”指示中教导我们：“工人以工为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化，也要搞社会主义教育运动，也要批判资产阶级。在有条件的地方，也要从事农副业生产，例如大庆油田那样。”毛主席的“五·七”指示，同样是我们工业部门进行革命，把工厂企业办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的奋斗纲领。我们一定要向革命的红卫兵小将学习，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神，以“斗私，批修”为纲，深入开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，把我们的工地办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。　（据新华社上海四日电）
