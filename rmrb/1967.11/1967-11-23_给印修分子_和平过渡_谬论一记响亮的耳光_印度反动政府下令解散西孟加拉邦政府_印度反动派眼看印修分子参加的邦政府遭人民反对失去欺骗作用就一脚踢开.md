The Indian reactionary government has ordered the dissolution of the West Bengal government. The Indian reactionaries, seeing that the state government, which includes Indian revisionist elements, has lost its deceptive effect due to popular opposition, have kicked it to the curb.

New Delhi, November 22 (Xinhua) — The reactionary central government, controlled by the Indian National Congress, ordered the dissolution of the West Bengal government late on the 21st. The Indian revisionists had hyped up this state government as a "people's government," but it collapsed after just about ten months. This shows that the Indian reactionaries' plot to deceive the people using it has quickly failed, and it is also another major failure of the "peaceful transition" line that the Indian revisionists have been vigorously advocating.

This state government, formed after the so-called "fourth general election" in India in February this year, had Jyoti Basu, an Indian revisionist, as the deputy chief minister, and there were also traitors from the Deng Xiaoping group holding official positions within it. Thus, the Indian revisionists attempted to use it to illustrate that "peaceful transition" through elections is "possible" and that the "parliamentary road" is "correct." They also advocated that such a state government is a "tool of struggle in the hands of the people" that can be used to "protect the interests of the people," actually covering up their treacherous acts of betraying the interests of the Indian revolution.

Over the past ten months, it has been proven that this state government, like other state governments in India, is a component of the Indian reactionary ruling machine. It not only cannot save the Indian people from their misery but also openly stands on the side of the landlords and big bourgeoisie, sending troops and police to brutally suppress the armed struggles of the peasants and the strikes of the workers. Its ugly face was quickly exposed to the Indian people. Seeing that this state government is opposed by the people and its deceptive effect is quickly lost, the Indian reactionaries simply removed it from power. After the collapse of this state government, the new chief minister who took the stage is strongly supported by the Indian National Congress. He had previously been a member of the Indian National Congress and had served as the chief minister of the first West Bengal government.

The Indian central government sent troops into the capital of West Bengal and the second-largest city in India, Calcutta, on the evening of the 21st. More than sixty trucks of troops patrolled the streets, banning gatherings of more than three people, and the entire city was placed under martial law.

In the northern part of this state, the revolutionary people continue to wage armed struggles under the leadership of the Indian Communist Party (Revolutionary). They reject the "parliamentary road" of the Indian revisionists and, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely struggle to open up the correct path for the Indian revolution.

    给印修分子“和平过渡”谬论一记响亮的耳光
    印度反动政府下令解散西孟加拉邦政府
    印度反动派眼看印修分子参加的邦政府遭人民反对失去欺骗作用就一脚踢开
    新华社二十二日讯　新德里消息：印度国大党控制的反动的中央政府，二十一日晚间下令解散西孟加拉邦政府。印共修正主义分子曾经把这个邦政府大肆吹捧为“人民政府”，但它只存在了十个月左右就垮了台。这表明印度反动派利用它来欺骗人民的阴谋迅速破产，同时也是印修拚命鼓吹的“和平过渡”路线的又一次大失败。
    今年二月印度“第四次大选”以后成立的这个邦政府，由印共修正主义分子乔蒂·巴苏当副首席部长，在邦政府内当官的还有叛徒丹吉集团分子。这样，印共修正主义分子就妄想利用它来说明，依靠选举来实现“和平过渡”是“可能的”，“议会道路”是“正确的”。他们还鼓吹什么这样的邦政府是“人民手里的斗争工具”，可以用来“维护人民的利益”，实际上是为他们叛卖印度革命利益的勾当打掩护。
    十个月来的事实证明，这个邦政府同印度其它邦政府一样，都是印度反动统治机器的组成部分。它不仅不能解救印度人民的苦难，而且公然站在地主和大资产阶级一边，出动军警血腥镇压农民的武装斗争和工人的罢工斗争。它的狰狞面目很快就暴露在印度人民面前。印度反动派看到这个邦政府遭到人民反对，欺骗作用迅速丧失，就干脆把它搞下台。在这个邦政府垮台以后，粉墨登场的新首席部长是得到国大党大力支持的，他曾经是国大党党员，并且担任过第一届西孟加拉邦政府的首席部长。
    印度中央政府在二十一日晚间把军队开入西孟加拉邦首府、印度第二大城市加尔各答。六十多卡车的军队在街上巡逻，严禁三人以上集会，全城宣布戒严。
    在这个邦的北部，革命的人民继续在印共革命派领导下开展武装斗争。他们唾弃了印修的“议会道路”，而在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，为开辟印度革命的正确道路而英勇奋斗。
