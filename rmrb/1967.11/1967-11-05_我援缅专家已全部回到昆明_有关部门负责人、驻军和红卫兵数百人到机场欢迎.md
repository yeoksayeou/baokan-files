	According to a report from the New China News Agency on November 4th - Rangoon News: The third batch of 132 Chinese experts departed Rangoon midday on November 4th on two special planes sent by the Chinese government. This was the last batch of Chinese experts to be repatriated by the Chinese government from Burma after the Ne Win reactionary government unilaterally tore up the Sino-Burmese economic and technological cooperation agreement and expelled the Chinese experts. Thus, all 412 Chinese experts working on various aid projects in Burma have returned to China.

	The Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Xiao Ming and embassy staff, along with personnel from other Chinese institutions, were at the airport to see off the Chinese experts. Some Burmese friends and representatives of over 800 patriotic overseas Chinese gathered outside the airport to bid farewell to the Chinese experts.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency on November 3rd - Rangoon News: The second batch of 140 Chinese experts departed midday on November 3rd on two special planes sent by the Chinese government.

	The Chinese Embassy's Chargé d'Affaires Xiao Ming and embassy staff, along with personnel from other Chinese institutions in Burma, went to the airport to see them off.

	Before leaving the Chinese Embassy for the airport, the Chinese experts gathered under a large banner with the Five-Star Red Flag and the words "Long Live Our Great Leader Chairman Mao!" written in red. They loudly read quotations from Chairman Mao and then sang the revolutionary song "The Ship Sails on with the Helmsman." Many patriotic overseas Chinese who came to the Chinese Embassy to bid farewell to the Chinese experts also sang with them, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life.

	Despite the Ne Win reactionary government dispatching plainclothes agents for stricter surveillance, some Burmese friends and even more patriotic overseas Chinese came to the airport to see off the Chinese experts. Overseas Chinese youth presented flowers to the Chinese experts. The patriotic overseas Chinese and the Chinese experts embraced tightly and shouted time and again, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao lives forever!"

    中国专家在离开中国大使馆前往机场之前，聚集在中国五星红旗和用红字写着“我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”的巨幅横幅下，高声朗读毛主席语录，然后齐唱革命歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》。到中国大使馆为中国专家送别的许多爱国华侨也和他们一起歌唱，敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。
    尽管缅甸反动政府派出便衣特务进行更严密的监视，但仍有一些缅甸朋友以及更多的爱国华侨到机场给中国专家送行。华侨青年向中国专家献了花。爱国华侨和中国专家紧紧拥抱，并一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
