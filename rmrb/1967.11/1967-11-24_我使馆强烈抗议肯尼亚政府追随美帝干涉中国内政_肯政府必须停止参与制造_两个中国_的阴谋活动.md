Our Embassy Strongly Protests the Kenyan Government's Following of U.S. Imperialism in Interfering in China's Internal Affairs
The Kenyan Government Must Stop Participating in the Conspiracy to Create "Two Chinas"

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: Nairobi News: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Kenya sent a note to the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, strongly protesting the Kenyan government's blatant following of U.S. imperialism in participating in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" and grossly interfering in China's internal affairs. The full text of the note is as follows:

Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Republic of Kenya sends the following note to the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

The Kenyan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in the Office of the President, Mr. Nyamweya, and two members of parliament visited Taiwan for four days on November 3rd. During the visit, Nyamweya met with the so-called "Vice President" and acting "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and held talks. Before leaving Taiwan, Mr. Nyamweya spoke to reporters, describing the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan as a "Chinese government striving to maintain democracy and freedom," and so on. Meanwhile, the Kenyan radio broadcasts and the *Nation* newspaper's propaganda both referred to Taiwan as the "Chinese government." The Kenyan government's blatant following of U.S. imperialism and participation in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" is a serious provocation against the Chinese government and the Chinese people, a gross interference in China's internal affairs, and a further serious step by the Kenyan government to worsen and destroy bilateral relations. The Government of the People's Republic of China strongly protests against the Government of the Republic of Kenya.

It is well known that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China and an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Chiang Kai-shek clique, under the protection of U.S. imperialist warships, is a bunch of traitors who have been fighting against the Chinese people. The U.S. imperialists support the Chiang clique to achieve their sinister plot of permanently occupying Taiwan and further attacking the Chinese mainland to enslave the Chinese people. The Chinese government has already declared: Any participation in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" is a hostile act and provocation against the Chinese people, and the Chinese government and people resolutely oppose it.

The Republic of Kenya and the People's Republic of China established formal diplomatic relations in December 1963, and both sides have exchanged ambassadors. The Kenyan government has repeatedly solemnly stated that it recognizes only the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China. However, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Kenya, some Kenyan ministers and members of parliament have visited Taiwan several times; the "Deputy Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Yang Xikun, has also visited Kenya several times. The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy have repeatedly made our solemn position clear to the Kenyan government. Now, the Kenyan government has sent the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in the Office of the President to visit Taiwan, and the Chinese government once again demands that the Kenyan government immediately stop participating in the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas." Otherwise, the Kenyan government will bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise.

    我使馆强烈抗议肯尼亚政府追随美帝干涉中国内政
    肯政府必须停止参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动
    新华社二十三日讯　内罗毕消息：中华人民共和国驻肯尼亚大使馆二十二日照会肯尼亚共和国外交部，强烈抗议肯尼亚政府明目张胆地追随美帝国主义，参与制造“两个中国”、粗暴干涉中国内政的阴谋活动。照会全文如下：肯尼亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻肯尼亚共和国大使馆照会肯尼亚共和国外交部如下：
    肯尼亚共和国总统办公室负责外交事务的国务部长尼亚姆韦亚先生和两名议员，于十一月三日到台湾访问了四天。在访问期间，尼亚姆韦亚曾拜会了蒋介石集团的所谓“副总统”和代理“外长”，并进行了会谈。尼亚姆韦亚部长先生在离开台湾前对记者的谈话，称赞台湾蒋介石集团是“努力维护民主自由的中国政府”，等等。与此同时，肯尼亚电台广播和《民族日报》的宣传中，都称台湾为“中国政府”。肯尼亚政府如此明目张胆地追随美国帝国主义，参与制造“两个中国”的活动，这是对中国政府和中国人民的严重挑衅，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是肯尼亚政府蓄意进一步恶化和破坏两国关系的又一严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国政府向肯尼亚共和国政府提出强烈抗议。
    众所周知，台湾是中华人民共和国的一个省，是中国领土不可分割的一部分。蒋介石集团是在美帝国主义军舰庇护下专同中国人民为敌的一伙民族败类。美帝国主义所以扶植蒋帮，是为了达到其永远霸占台湾，进而进攻中国大陆、奴役中国人民的侵略阴谋。中国政府早已声明：任何参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，都是对中国人民的敌视和挑衅，中国政府和中国人民坚决反对。
    肯尼亚共和国和中华人民共和国于一九六三年十二月建立了正式外交关系，双方并互派了大使。肯尼亚政府曾一再庄严地表示，只承认中华人民共和国政府为中国唯一的合法政府。但自中肯建交以来，肯尼亚的一些部长和议员曾数次去台湾访问；蒋介石集团的“外交次长”杨西昆也数次到肯尼亚进行访问。对此，中国政府和中国大使馆曾多次向肯尼亚政府表明了我们的严正立场。现在，肯尼亚政府竟又派出总统办公室负责外交事务的国务部长到台湾进行访问，中国政府再次提出，肯尼亚政府应该立即停止参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动，否则，由此而引起的一切后果，必须由肯尼亚政府全部承担。

    一九六七年十一月二十二日
