	Political line determined, cadres are the decisive factor. Therefore, it is our combat mission to train a large number of new cadres in a planned way.

	Growing Up Under the Nurture of Mao Zedong Thought

	Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, Kong Xiangshan

	Upon hearing the latest directive from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao: "We must solve the problem of relations between superiors and subordinates well, and improve the relations between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to walk around, see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." I felt particularly close to it. Chairman Mao liberated us, a batch of Red Guards, from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line, and directed us to seize power from the hands of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Because we did not study Chairman Mao's works enough and lacked experience, we were feeling the difficulties of work when Chairman Mao timely issued the latest directive to guide us forward. How could this not make one extremely excited and eager to jump and shout with joy!

	In the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution, I felt everywhere that Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in creating world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." are absolutely true. Whenever we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went among the masses to listen to their opinions, and fully mobilized the masses, we felt that we seemed to be much smarter, had more ideas, more enthusiasm, and things were much easier to do. Whenever we thought we were right and detached from the masses, did not mobilize the masses, we felt that our heads were empty, there was no way to work, things could not be done well, and mistakes were made. During the "January Revolution," we were preparing to seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, but we were still hesitant. However, once we went among the masses to discuss, the masses said: "The longer the capitalist-roaders rule, the more evil they do. We cannot wait any longer!" With the support of the broad revolutionary masses, we gained confidence, found a way, and seized power. At the beginning of the great criticism, we thought we were right, set topics, drew frames, and formed a criticism group. As a result, the masses did not understand the significance of the great criticism and did not get involved, the criticism group was exhausted, and the great criticism was not done well. We blamed the masses, the more we criticized, the worse it got. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's works, went down to hold investigation meetings, understood the reasons, and did ideological work, and the great criticism was carried out. The facts prove that once you become a cadre, you think you are extraordinary, you put on airs, the masses will not treat you as one of their own. No matter how clever you are, if the masses do not buy it, it is in vain. Moreover, without the masses, there will be no clever ideas.

	In addition to learning from the masses, we should also learn from revolutionary old cadres. Many revolutionary old cadres have deep feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. They dare to take on heavy responsibilities and care for and love the revolutionary youngsters very much. In our school, there is an old cadre who often works until late at night, and his body has obviously become thinner. We asked him to pay attention to his rest. He said: "You are young, you should pay more attention to your body." For comrades who hold different opinions, we wanted to suppress them. He used his past experiences and lessons to enlighten and educate us, helping us to correctly treat them. In correctly treating cadres and classmates who have made mistakes, he also repeatedly helped us, making us less likely to make mistakes. We learned a lot from him.

	Chairman Mao said: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of your life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." Chairman Mao has such high hopes for us! We must have the spirit to study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, never detach from the masses, and strive to be good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

### 在毛泽东思想哺育下成长

    政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。因此，有计划地培养大批的新干部，就是我们的战斗任务。    毛泽东
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长
    北京邮电学院革命委员会主任委员　孔祥山
    听到最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”我感到格外亲切。毛主席把我们这批红卫兵从资产阶级反动路线的枷锁下解放出来，指挥我们从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权。由于我们学习毛主席著作不够，又缺乏经验，正在感到工作困难的时候，毛主席适时地发出了最新指示，指导我们前进。这怎能不令人万分激动，怎能不令人跳跃欢呼！
    在文化大革命的斗争实践中，我处处感到毛主席他老人家的教导：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”是千真万确的真理。什么时候，我们遵照毛主席的教导，到群众中去听取意见，充分把群众发动起来，什么时候就觉得自己似乎聪明得多，有办法得多，干劲也足得多，事情也就好办得多。什么时候，我们自以为是，脱离群众，不发动群众，什么时候就感到头脑空虚，工作没有办法，事情搞不好，还要犯错误。“一月革命”时，我们准备夺党内一小撮走资派的权，不过还很犹豫，可是一到群众中去讨论，群众说：“多让走资派统治一天，就多让他们作恶一天。不能再等待了！”在广大革命群众的支持下，我们信心足了，办法有了，就夺了权。在革命大批判开始的时候，我们自以为是，出题目，划框框，搞了一个批判组，结果群众不了解大批判的意义，没有动起来，累坏了批判组，也没有把大批判搞好。我们责怪群众，越是指责，越是不行。后来，我们学习了毛主席著作，下去开调查会，了解了原因，又做了思想工作，革命大批判就搞起来了。事实证明，当了干部，就自命不凡，就摆架子，群众就不把你当自己人。你再高明，群众不买账也白搭。何况离开了群众，绝不会有什么高明的主意。
    除了要向群众学习，还要向革命老干部学习。许多革命老干部对党和毛主席的感情很深，他们敢于挑重担，对革命小将很关心爱护。我们学校有个老干部经常工作到深夜，身体很明显地瘦了，我们要他注意休息。他却说：“你们年轻，身体要更注意一些。”对持有不同意见的同志，我们想压。他就用自己过去的经验和教训来启发教育我们，帮助我们正确对待。在正确对待干部和犯过错误的同学方面，他也一再帮助我们，使我们不犯或少犯错误。我们从他身上学到了不少东西。
    毛主席说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”毛主席对我们寄予多大的希望啊！我们一定要有志气，努力学习毛泽东思想，永远听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，永远不脱离群众，争取当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
