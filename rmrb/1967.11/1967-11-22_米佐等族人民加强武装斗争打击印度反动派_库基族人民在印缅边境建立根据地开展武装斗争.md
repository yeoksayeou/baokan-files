In eastern India, the Mizo, Naga, and Kuki peoples, who have been waging armed resistance against the Indian reactionary regime, have repeatedly struck at Indian reactionary military and police forces in the past few weeks, causing great panic among the Indian reactionary government.

Armed Mizo people attacked an Indian reactionary armed police outpost near Tripura on the 15th, killing six reactionary policemen. The Chief Minister of the Manipur Central Directly Administered Area acknowledged that Mizo armed struggles are rapidly expanding in that area.

Recently, several hundred Naga people entered the Mizo Hills from Manipur to join forces with the Mizo armed struggle, strengthening attacks on Indian reactionary troops.

In other parts of Assam, the armed struggles of the Mizo and Naga peoples are also very active. Shortly after two bombs exploded in the local government offices in Shillong, the capital of Assam, in early November, the Indian reactionary government, fearing new attacks, deployed armed police to guard government offices day and night.

The national armed forces also burned down a strategic bridge about 45 miles south of Shillong on November 8.

Due to the near-total paralysis of the reactionary government in the Mizo Hills, the Indian central government is plotting to implement martial law there. It has already convened senior officials from the Eastern Command and local officials in New Delhi to discuss this issue.

The Mizo people have been in armed rebellion against national oppression since February 28, 1966. Their armed struggle has lasted nearly two years. The Naga armed struggle has lasted more than a decade. These facts refute the Indian revisionists' claim that there are no conditions for armed struggle in India.

It is also reported that another ethnic group in eastern India, the Kuki people, recently established a base in the Huama area of the Ukhrul subdivision, which borders India and Burma. Like the Naga and Mizo peoples, they are waging armed struggle against the Indian reactionary government.

    米佐等族人民加强武装斗争打击印度反动派
    库基族人民在印缅边境建立根据地开展武装斗争
    新华社二十一日讯  新德里消息：在印度东部，坚持武装反对印度反动统治的米佐族、那加族和库基族人民，在过去几周中一再打击印度反动军警，使印度反动政府十分恐慌。
    武装的米佐族人民十五日袭击了特里普拉附近印度反动武装警察的哨所，打死反动警察六人。附近的曼尼普尔中央直属领地的印度首席部长承认，那一带的米佐武装斗争正在迅速扩展。
    最近，好几百名那加族人民从曼尼普尔进入米佐山区，以便同米佐族武装联合起来，加强对印度反动军队的袭击。
    在阿萨姆邦的其它地区，米佐和那加族人民的武装斗争也很活跃。十一月初，在阿萨姆邦首府西隆的地方政府办公处爆炸了两颗炸弹之后，印度反动政府害怕新的袭击，出动武装警察昼夜守卫政府各办公处。
    民族武装还在十一月八日放火烧坏了西隆以南大约四十五英里的一座战略桥梁。
    由于统治米佐山区的反动政府几乎完全瘫痪，印度中央政府阴谋在那里实行军事管制。它已经把印度东部军区的司令和地方官员召到新德里举行有关这个问题的高级会议。
    米佐族人民是从一九六六年二月二十八日起举行武装起义，反抗民族压迫的。他们的武装斗争已经坚持了将近两年。那加族的武装斗争已经坚持了十多年。这些事实粉碎了印度修正主义分子所谓在印度没有条件开展武装斗争的谬论。
    另据报道，印度东部的另一个民族库基族人不久以前在印度和缅甸接壤的乌克鲁尔分区的胡马地方，建立了根据地，象那加、米佐等族一样，向印度反动政府开展武装斗争。
