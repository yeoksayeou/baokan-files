Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advancing victoriously along the revolutionary literary and artistic line of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Japanese Gear Seat Theater Troupe held their final performance in Shanghai on the evening of the 6th during their visit to China. A closing ceremony was held before the performance, attended by leading members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Wang Shaoyong, Ma Tianhui, Gao Zhirong, Xu Jingxian, Feng Guozhu, and Zhu Xiqin.

Wang Shaoyong, on behalf of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary people of Shanghai, extended the warmest congratulations to the Gear Seat Theater Troupe for their outstanding achievements in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and their tremendous success in their visit to China. He said, the Gear Seat Theater Troupe's visit to China not only brought the deep-felt fighting friendship of the Japanese proletarian revolutionary forces and the Japanese people, but also, through their performances, showed us the heroic revolutionary spirit and the brave fighting deeds of the Japanese people. This once again proves what Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." We are firmly convinced that, although the road of struggle is tortuous and arduous, under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a bright and brilliant socialist new Japan will surely emerge on the eastern horizon. Wang Shaoyong said, the proletarian revolutionary forces and the people of China and Japan, united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly make new and greater contributions to the unity and friendship of the peoples of China and Japan, to the cause of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and to the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world.

In her speech at the closing ceremony, Fujikawa Natsuko, the director of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe, expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf of all the revolutionary cultural warriors of the troupe to the Chinese people for their enthusiastic support. She said, we came to China to visit at the moment when the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victory. We feel boundless happiness that on October 23rd we finally saw the great leader of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao. This is a great encouragement and the greatest support for the Japanese revolutionary people who are bravely fighting against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and the revisionist group of Miyamoto. She said, the success of our visit to China is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese revolutionary literature and art have pointed out the direction for us to advance. Revolutionary literature and art armed with Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line is a powerful weapon to smash bourgeois and revisionist ideology. Fujikawa Natsuko said, after returning to Japan, we will definitely use the precious experience we have learned in the world revolutionary stronghold—China, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher under the leadership of the left wing of the Japanese Communist Party, and push the struggle against American imperialism, the Sato sell-out government, and the Miyamoto revisionist group to new heights, and resolutely advance for the liberation of the Japanese people.

The Japanese Gear Seat Theater Troupe performed eight shows in Shanghai. Their performances of the revolutionary and fighting-spirited plays "Wildfire" and "Advancing Against the Storm" were warmly welcomed and highly praised by the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai.

    日本齿轮座胜利完成访华演出
    藤川团长强调这次演出成功是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利
    据新华社上海八日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进的日本齿轮座剧团革命文艺战士，六日晚上在上海举行了访问中国的最后一场演出。在演出前举行了闭幕式，上海市革命委员会领导成员王少庸、马天水、高志荣、徐景贤、冯国柱、朱锡琪等出席了闭幕式。
    王少庸在闭幕式上代表上海市革命委员会和上海革命人民，最热烈地祝贺齿轮座剧团宣传毛泽东思想所取得的卓越成就和访华演出的巨大成功。他说，齿轮座剧团来我国访问演出，不仅带来了日本无产阶级革命派和日本人民深厚的战斗友谊，而且通过演出使我们看到了日本人民豪迈的革命志气和英勇斗争的事迹，这再一次证明了毛主席所说的“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”我们深信，尽管斗争的道路是曲折的、艰巨的，但是，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，一个红彤彤的光辉灿烂的社会主义的新日本，终将会出现在东方的地平线上。王少庸说，用毛泽东思想连接起来的中日两国无产阶级革命派和两国人民，必将为中日两国人民在毛泽东思想基础上的团结和友好、为反帝反修的革命事业，为毛泽东思想在全世界的伟大胜利，不断地作出新的更大的贡献。
    齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子在闭幕式上讲话时，代表剧团的全体革命文艺战士对中国人民的热情支持表示衷心感谢。她说，我们是在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻来到中国访问的。我们感到无限幸福的是：十月二十三日我们终于见到了世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席，这是对正在和美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团一伙进行英勇斗争的日本革命人民的巨大支持和最大鼓励。她说，我们这次访华演出的成功，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。在毛泽东思想指导下的中国革命文艺，给我们指出了前进的方向。用毛主席的革命文艺路线武装起来的革命文艺，是摧毁资产阶级、修正主义思想的有力武器。藤川夏子说，我们回国后，一定要运用在世界革命堡垒——中国所学到的宝贵经验，在日本共产党左派的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反对美帝国主义、佐藤卖国政府、宫本修正主义集团的斗争推向新的高潮，誓为日本人民的解放而奋勇前进。
    日本齿轮座剧团在上海共演出了八场。他们演出的具有革命战斗精神的《野火》、《迎着暴风雨前进》两个话剧，受到上海广大革命群众的热烈欢迎和高度赞扬。
