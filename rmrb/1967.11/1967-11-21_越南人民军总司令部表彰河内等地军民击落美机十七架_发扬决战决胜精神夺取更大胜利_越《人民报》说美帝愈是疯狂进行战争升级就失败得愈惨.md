The General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army sent a telegram on the 19th to the military and civilians of Hanoi and other regions, commending them for their brilliant victory of shooting down 17 American aggressor aircraft on the 19th. The commendation telegram said that the military and civilians of North Vietnam have given the American aggressors a thunderous blow, making the entire nation's military and civilians jubilant.

The telegram pointed out that the stubborn American aggressors, although suffering continuous defeats on all battlefields in both North and South Vietnam, still resort to various brutal and cunning tactics.

The commendation telegram called on the military and civilians of the North to remain vigilant, deepen their hatred for the enemy, and carry forward the spirit of decisive battle and victory to smash all the plots and tactics of the American aggressors and achieve greater victories.

The Vietnam People's Daily published an editorial on the 20th, enthusiastically hailing the heroic military and civilians of Hanoi and other regions for shooting down 17 American aggressor aircraft and capturing multiple American air pirates in a single day on the 19th.

The editorial said that the glorious achievements of Hanoi and other regions, along with the great victories in the South, are a stern warning to the Johnson administration, which is plotting in Washington to find a way out of the quagmire of the Vietnam War. The more frantically the American aggressors escalate the war and spread their deceitful peace talks, the more severe their defeats will be.

The editorial said that the American aggressors have never been in such a desperate and helpless situation as they are today. Our strength has never been as abundant as it is today. The momentum of our victory has never been as overwhelming as it is today. The victories in both the North and the South have never been as great as they are today.

The editorial concluded by saying that American imperialism is still recklessly and foolishly pursuing the path of war escalation. We must be vigilant against its sinister plots and be ready to strike it with even greater force at any time.

    越南人民军总司令部表彰河内等地军民击落美机十七架
    发扬决战决胜精神夺取更大胜利
    越《人民报》说美帝愈是疯狂进行战争升级就失败得愈惨
    新华社河内二十日电  越南人民军总司令部十九日打电报给河内市及其他地区军民，嘉奖他们在十九日击落美国强盗飞机十七架的辉煌胜利。嘉奖电说，越南北方军民这次给美国强盗以雷霆般的打击，使全国军民欢欣鼓舞。
    电报指出，顽固的美国强盗虽然在越南南北两方所有各个战场上接连遭到失败，但它还要玩弄许多残暴、狡猾的手段。
    嘉奖电号召北方军民必须提高警惕，加深对敌人的仇恨，发扬决战决胜精神，粉碎美国强盗的一切阴谋和手段，夺取更大的胜利。
    新华社河内二十日电  越南《人民报》二十日发表社论，热烈欢呼英雄的河内市和其他地区军民十九日一举击落美国强盗飞机十七架，活捉美国飞贼多名的辉煌胜利。
    社论说，河内等地的显赫战功和南方的各次大捷，是对正在华盛顿策划摆脱侵越战争困境阴谋的约翰逊集团的严厉警告。美国强盗越是疯狂地进行战争升级，越是散布狡诈的和平论调，就越遭到更加惨重的失败。
    社论说，美国强盗的处境从来也没有象今天这样窘迫和走投无路。我们的力量从来也没有象今天这样充沛。我们的胜利的气势从来也没有象今天这样磅礴。我国南北两方的胜利从来也没有象今天这样巨大。
    社论最后说，美帝国主义仍然冒险和愚蠢地沿着罪恶滔天的战争升级道路走下去。我们必须对它的不可告人的阴谋提高警惕，随时准备给它以更加猛烈的打击。
