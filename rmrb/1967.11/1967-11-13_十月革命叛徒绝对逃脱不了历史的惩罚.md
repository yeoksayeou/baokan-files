The farce staged by the Soviet revisionist leadership on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution cannot conceal the treacherous nature and desperate situation of the traitors. Brezhnev and Kosygin madly attack Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Cultural Revolution, but the Soviet people declare, "Salute to Mao Zedong!"

BEIJING, Nov. 12 (Xinhua) — The Soviet revisionist leadership has gone to great lengths to stage a so-called "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, which has now ended in a shambles. In this farce, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk shamelessly pose as the "heirs" of the October Revolution, engaging in deception to cover up their complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, to escape their dire internal and external predicaments, and to maintain their crumbling "thrones," continuing to push the revisionist line of Khrushchev. However, these traitors have only made things worse for themselves. The Soviet revisionist leadership has been busy for nearly a year preparing and staging this shameful performance. On January 4 of this year, they issued a resolution under the name of the "CPSU Central Committee" to prepare for the "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, signaling the start of the show. On June 25, they published the "commemoration" outline. On the eve of the anniversary, they followed up with various tricks such as awarding medals and honors to win hearts and minds. From November 3 to 7, they mobilized all their forces to organize various "commemoration" rallies, parades, and marches in Moscow, Leningrad, and other places. At the same time, they mobilized their entire propaganda machine, publishing numerous editorials and articles, and printing various pamphlets to spread deception. They also organized various so-called "international conferences" and "academic conferences" to support their own cause.

The most important part of the Soviet revisionist leadership's carefully planned deception was Brezhnev's long and stinking speech at the "commemoration" meeting in the Kremlin on November 3. This report peddled a whole set of revisionist goods from the 20th to the 23rd Congress of the CPSU and the "CPSU Program," serving as a confession of their betrayal of the path of the October Revolution, of Marxism-Leninism, and their continued pursuit of a counter-revolutionary revisionist line to fully restore capitalism in the Soviet Union and maintain imperialist and colonialist rule internationally.

In his report, Brezhnev brazenly distorted and falsified the history of the great October Revolution led by Lenin, making every effort to deny and oppose the violent revolution of the proletariat and the armed seizure of power. He deliberately avoided the fact that the Russian proletariat, under Lenin's leadership, seized power through violent revolution, instead emphasizing the so-called "peaceful and non-peaceful forms of struggle," the "diversity" and "flexible strategies" of the transition to socialism. The report stated that the "experience" of the world revolutionary movement over the past 50 years since the October Revolution had "expanded the concept of the paths and methods of revolutionary struggle," and that the October Revolution had shown that regardless of the form of revolution, the working class could "achieve victory." They attempted to smuggle in the idea of "peaceful transition," forcing the Soviet revisionist counter-revolutionary line onto the proletariat of various countries.

In his report, Brezhnev fiercely opposed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, socialism, and communism. He completely avoided the necessity of the proletariat smashing the bourgeois state machine and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and went all out to justify the crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership in abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union and establishing a brutal bourgeois dictatorship. He claimed that in the Soviet Union, "social antagonisms and national antagonisms" had "disappeared forever," and that all social classes were "united by their common interests, goals, and ideals." Therefore, in the Soviet Union, the state, which was originally the dictatorship of the proletariat, had become a "state of the whole people," a "political organization of the entire people." The report desperately covered up the fact that the Soviet revisionists had fully restored capitalism domestically, obscured the increasingly sharp class struggle between the Soviet working people and the bourgeois privileged class, and falsely claimed that the Soviet Union had been implementing a "cultural revolution" since the October Revolution and that there were no privileged classes and strata in the Soviet Union. The report boasted about Khrushchev's revisionist pseudo-communism, claiming that the "economic system" they promoted in various sectors of the national economy, with capitalist profit as its core, was the "principle of socialist management."

Internationally, Brezhnev vigorously promoted the revisionist goods of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition." He exaggerated the "disaster" of rocket and nuclear warfare, indiscriminately propagated that war was the "greatest evil," and opposed the armed struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations for liberation. He continued to play tricks of false support, false anti-imperialism, and false revolution, shamelessly declaring that the foreign policy of the Soviet revisionist leadership was supposedly "internationalist," that its "entire content was thoroughly revolutionary," and even falsely claimed that they had "resolutely abandoned" the "policy of secret diplomacy and collusion behind the backs of the peoples of various countries," and so on. Brezhnev's empty rhetoric was nothing more than an attempt to cover up the Soviet revisionist leadership's complete betrayal of proletarian internationalism, their counter-revolutionary global collusion with U.S. imperialism, their active role as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism, and their suppression of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

The so-called "commemoration" activities of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique for the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution were permeated with an anti-China line from beginning to end. At the "commemoration" meeting on November 3, Brezhnev took the lead in attacking China. He repeatedly named and viciously attacked the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally has thoroughly smashed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and has shaken the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership. Therefore, Brezhnev cursed this Cultural Revolution in his report and summoned the spirits of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in China who have been overthrown, inciting them to make a last-ditch struggle. He also slandered the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people for holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, opposing imperialism led by the United States, and opposing modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership as "chauvinism" and "great power chauvinism." He defamed the consistent principled position of the Chinese people in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, attacking China for not following these traitors in coordinating actions on the Vietnamese issue, attempting to cover up the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the Vietnamese people and acting as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism.

Brezhnev hoped to use his anti-China opening act to lead a group of lackeys to perform an anti-China chorus. However, contrary to his wishes, the only ones who dared to come out and openly shout anti-China slogans this time were the notorious lackey of U.S. imperialism, the great traitor Tito, and the obedient servant of the Indian reactionaries, Dange, as well as a few others like Gomulka and Zhivkov, making a cold and pathetic show.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China activities can absolutely not harm the deep friendship between the great Soviet people and the Chinese people, nor can they stop their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. On November 7, when the "commemoration" parade was held in Moscow, an elderly Soviet man in his sixties saw a Chinese comrade on the side of the road and warmly asked, "How is Chairman Mao?" The Chinese comrade told him that Chairman Mao was in good health. The old man said, "That's good." The Chinese comrade wished the old man a happy holiday, and he smiled and said, "Thank you, salute to Mao Zedong!" Two Soviet youths participating in the parade, as the procession was about to enter Red Square, actively asked the Chinese comrade for a portrait of Chairman Mao. The Chinese comrade immediately fulfilled their request. At this time, a Soviet secret police officer stepped forward to criticize the two youths, but was immediately rebutted by many people in the parade.

The Soviet revisionist leadership had planned to use the opportunity of the "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to convene a world gathering of traitors and scoundrels. Before this, they had been busy preparing for this anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary black meeting. Brezhnev once again shouted in his November 3 report to convene the black meeting and expressed his willingness to "exert every effort" for this purpose. However, only a few lackeys openly expressed support, and even then, they were discordant and out of tune. This once again reflected the deep-seated contradictions among the modern revisionists, who were in bed together but dreaming differently.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Reactionaries who appear in disguise give a false impression while hiding their true nature. But since they are reactionaries, they cannot completely hide their true nature." The bunch of thorough traitors and scoundrels in the Kremlin attempted to use the so-called "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to put gold on their own faces, but their reactionary essence will absolutely not change, and they will absolutely not deceive the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world. This bunch of traitors, under the banner of "commemorating" the October Revolution, engaged in counter-revolutionary criminal activities, which is a great insult to the great October Socialist Revolution. All those who betray the October Revolution will absolutely not escape the punishment of history. Khrushchev has already fallen. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is even more brazen in carrying out their treacherous policies, and their days are numbered. The Soviet people will definitely hoist the glorious banner of the October Revolution, launch a great offensive against the Soviet revisionist leadership, and defeat them completely.

    十月革命叛徒绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚
    苏修领导集团在十月革命五十周年上演的大丑剧掩饰不了叛徒的丑恶面目和狼狈处境勃列日涅夫疯狂攻击毛泽东思想和中国文化大革命，但苏联人民表示“向毛泽东致敬！”
    新华社十二日讯　本社记者报道：苏修领导集团费尽心机上演的所谓“纪念”十月革命五十周年的丑剧，已经草草收场。在这场丑剧中，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流恬不知耻地冒充十月革命事业的“继承者”，进行招摇撞骗，妄图借此掩饰自己彻底背叛马克思列宁主义的丑恶面目，摆脱内外交困的狼狈处境，维持他们支离歪斜的“宝座”，继续推行赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线。但是，这些叛徒弄巧成拙，欲盖弥彰。苏修领导集团为了准备和进行这场可耻的演出，几乎忙了整整一年。今年一月四日，他们以“苏共中央”名义通过筹备“纪念”十月革命五十周年的决议，敲响了开场锣鼓。六月二十五日，他们又发表了“纪念”“提纲”。在节日前夕，他们紧接着玩弄了颁奖授勋等花招，以笼络人心。从十一月三日到七日，他们倾巢出动，在莫斯科、列宁格勒等地组织了各种“纪念”集会、阅兵和游行。与此同时，他们开动了全部宣传机器，连篇累牍地发表社论、文章，大量出版各种各样的小册子，进行欺骗宣传。他们还组织了各种名目的所谓“国际会议”和“学术会议”，来为自己捧场帮腔。
    苏修集团苦心策划的这个大骗局的重要节目，是勃列日涅夫三日在克里姆林宫“纪念”大会上所作的又臭又长的报告。这个报告大肆贩卖苏共二十大到二十三大和“苏共纲领”的一整套修正主义货色，是一个疯狂地反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，疯狂地反共、反华、反人民、反革命、反社会主义的黑文件。它是苏修领导集团背叛十月革命道路，背叛马克思列宁主义，继续推行在苏联全面复辟资本主义、在国际上维护帝国主义和殖民主义统治的反革命修正主义路线的自供状。
    勃列日涅夫在报告中，明目张胆地篡改和歪曲伟大列宁所领导的十月革命的历史，千方百计地否定和反对无产阶级暴力革命，反对武装夺取政权。他极力回避俄国无产阶级在列宁领导下通过暴力革命夺取政权的事实，反而别有用心地大谈什么“和平的与非和平的斗争形式”、向社会主义过渡的“多样化”和“灵活策略”。报告说，“十月革命后五十年以来，世界革命运动”的“经验扩大了关于革命斗争的途径和方法的概念”，“十月革命表明”，“不管采取什么革命形式”工人阶级都“能取得胜利”，妄图用这种办法偷运“和平过渡”的私货，把苏修这条反革命路线硬塞给各国无产阶级。
    勃列日涅夫在报告中大肆反对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政、关于社会主义和共产主义的学说。他完全回避无产阶级打碎资产阶级国家机器和建立无产阶级专政的必要性，极力为苏修领导集团在苏联取消无产阶级专政，实行残酷的资产阶级专政的罪行辩解。他说，在苏联，“社会对抗和民族对抗”已经“永远消失了”，各社会阶级“由于利益、目标和理想的一致而联结在一起”，因此在苏联“作为无产阶级专政的国家”，已经“成了全民的国家”，成了“全体人民的政治组织”。报告拚命掩盖苏修在国内已全面复辟资本主义的事实，抹杀苏联劳动人民同资产阶级特权阶层之间日益尖锐的阶级斗争，胡说什么苏联从十月革命一开始“就实行了文化革命”，苏联现在“没有特权阶级和阶层”。报告大吹特吹赫鲁晓夫修正主义那一套假共产主义，说什么他们在国民经济各部门推行的以资本主义利润原则为核心的“经济体制”是“社会主义经营原则”。
    在国际方面，勃列日涅夫大肆鼓吹“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”等修正主义货色。他极力渲染火箭核武器战争的“灾难”，不分是非地宣传战争是“最大的坏事”，反对被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的武装斗争。他继续玩弄假支持、假反帝、假革命的手法，厚颜无耻地宣称苏修集团的对外政策是所谓“国际主义的”，“其全部内容是彻底革命的”，甚至诡称他们“坚决摒弃了”“秘密外交手腕和在各国人民背后进行勾结的政策”，等等。勃列日涅夫发出这些陈词滥调，无非是为了掩盖苏修集团彻底背叛无产阶级国际主义，同美帝大搞反革命全球大勾结，积极充当美帝的头号帮凶，扼杀各国人民的革命斗争的丑恶行径。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团的所谓“纪念”十月革命五十周年活动，自始至终贯穿着一条反华黑线。在三日的“纪念”大会上，勃列日涅夫大放厥词，带头反华。他多次指名恶毒地攻击当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，震撼了苏修领导集团的反动统治。因此，勃列日涅夫在报告中咬牙切齿地咒骂这场文化大革命，并为被打倒了的中国一小撮反革命修正主义分子招魂，煽动他们进行垂死挣扎。他还诬蔑中国共产党和中国人民高举无产阶级国际主义旗帜，反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，是什么“沙文主义”、“大国主义”。他诽谤中国人民一贯支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的原则立场，攻击中国不同他们这些叛徒在越南问题上搞什么“协调行动”，妄图借此掩盖苏修集团背叛越南人民，充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的反革命嘴脸。
    勃列日涅夫本想用他这一反华的开场锣鼓，带动一帮走卒起来串演反华大合唱。可是，事与愿违，这次敢于跳出来，跟着他的调子公开叫嚷反华的，只有臭名昭著的美帝忠实走狗、大叛徒铁托和印度反动派的驯服奴仆丹吉，以及哥穆尔卡、日夫科夫等寥寥数人，冷冷落落简直不成气候。
    苏修集团的反华活动绝对损害不了伟大的苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，阻挡不了他们对伟大领袖毛泽东主席的无限热爱。就在十一月七日，当莫斯科举行“纪念”节日的游行时，一位六十多岁的苏联老人看到路旁的中国同志，便亲切地问道：“毛主席好吗？”中国同志告诉他说，毛主席身体非常健康。这位老人说：“这就好。”中国同志向老人祝贺节日，他微笑着说：“谢谢，向毛泽东致敬！”两个参加游行的苏联青年在队伍快进入红场时，主动地向中国同志要毛主席像章，中国同志立即满足了他们的要求。这时苏修特务出面对这两位青年横加指责，但当即被游行队伍中的许多人顶了回去。
    苏修集团本想利用“纪念”十月革命五十周年的机会，策划召开世界叛徒工贼大集会。在此以前，他们一直为召开这种反共、反华、反人民、反革命的黑会而奔忙。勃列日涅夫在三日的报告中又一次声嘶力竭地鼓吹召开黑会，并表示准备为此“尽一切力量”。但是，只有少数娄罗公开表示支持，而且七嘴八舌，调子不一。这再一次反映了现代修正主义者们，同床异梦，矛盾重重。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”克里姆林宫中一伙彻头彻尾的叛徒和工贼，妄图通过所谓“纪念”十月革命五十周年的活动，往自己脸上贴金，但是，他们反革命的本质是绝对不会改变的，他们绝对欺骗不了苏联人民和世界革命人民。这伙叛徒打着“纪念”十月革命的旗号，进行反革命的罪恶勾当，是对伟大十月社会主义革命的莫大侮辱。一切背叛十月革命的人，绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。赫鲁晓夫早就垮台了。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团变本加厉地实行叛卖政策，他们的寿命也是长不了的。苏联人民一定会高举十月革命的光荣旗帜，大造苏修领导集团的反，把他们打个落花流水。
