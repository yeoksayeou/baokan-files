Our Harbin Municipal Fisheries Supply and Marketing Cooperative Red Rebel Corps has, since May, held six study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, with revolutionary cadres participating in each one. We have engaged in self-criticism and mutual criticism, fought against selfishness and revisionism, deepened our understanding of each other, and strengthened our unity.

We respect revolutionary old cadres, learn from them, take their strengths, and make up for our own weaknesses. They also take our strengths and make up for their own weaknesses. We learn from each other and make joint progress. A new type of relationship has been established between revolutionary old and new cadres.

After seizing power, the red rebels in our company firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "to lead a great revolution, we need a great party and many excellent cadres." We have made it a conscious action to learn from revolutionary cadres. We have found that many revolutionary leading cadres, after coming forward, dare to engage in self-criticism, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, consult with the masses on matters, and are good at doing detailed political and ideological work. We learn from these strengths of theirs and use them to strictly demand of ourselves. For example, we have observed that some revolutionary cadres, after coming forward, insist on going to the front lines to do hard work and participate in physical labor. We have promptly commended them and called on the masses to learn from them. In our Red Guard meetings and meetings of leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, we also invite them to participate, humbly seek their opinions, and ask them to serve as consultants. Revolutionary cadres, seeing that the masses trust and support them so much, also consciously learn from the revolutionary masses. For example, they see that the red rebels, after seizing power, eagerly study Chairman Mao's works; in the great criticism, dare to engage in head-to-head struggle with the capitalist roaders within the party, and so on, and they actively learn from the red rebels. While learning from revolutionary cadres, the red rebels also wholeheartedly help them correct their shortcomings and mistakes. For example, one leading cadre, after coming forward, did not dare to work boldly and had many selfish thoughts. The red rebels took the initiative to help him, finding the causes of these thoughts together, and helping him to change promptly. Revolutionary cadres, upon seeing the shortcomings of the red rebels, also promptly help them.

    向革命老干部学习
    我们哈尔滨市水产供销公司红色造反团，五月份以来，连续举办了六次毛泽东思想学习班，每次都有革命的领导干部参加。我们共同斗私批修，多作自我批评，促进互相的了解，增进了团结。
    我们尊重革命的老干部，向他们学习，取他们之长，补自己之短。他们也以我们之长，补自己之短。我们互相学习，共同提高，革命的新老干部之间建立了新型的关系。
    我们公司红色造反者在夺权以后，牢牢地记住毛主席关于“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部”的教导，把向革命干部学习，作为自觉的行动。我们发现许多革命的领导干部在站出来以后，勇于进行自我批评，刻苦学习毛主席著作，遇事找群众商量，又善于做细致的政治思想工作。我们就学习他们的这些优点，并用来严格要求自己。如我们观察到有的革命干部在站出来以后，要求到第一线去作艰苦工作和参加体力劳动。我们及时表扬了他们，并号召群众向他们学习。我们开红卫兵会和革命群众组织负责人会，也都邀请他们参加，虚心征求他们的意见，请他们当参谋。革命干部看到群众这样信赖和支持他们，也自觉地向革命群众学习。例如他们看到红色造反者在掌权以后如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作；在革命的大批判中敢于同党内走资派进行针锋相对的斗争，等等，就积极向红色造反者学习。红色造反者在向革命干部学习的同时，还满腔热忱地帮助他们改正缺点和错误。例如有一个领导干部在站出来以后，工作不大胆，私心杂念很重。红色造反者就主动帮助他，同他一起找产生这种思想的原因，使他及时地转变过来。革命干部在看到红色造反者的缺点以后，也及时地进行帮助。
