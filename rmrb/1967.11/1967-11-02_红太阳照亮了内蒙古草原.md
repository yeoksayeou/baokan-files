The red sun illuminates the Inner Mongolia grasslands.

A great piece of news has come from the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia. On the northern frontier of our country, a bastion against revisionism, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been established!

The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee marks the complete collapse of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and separatists in the region, severing the black hands of their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, reaching into Inner Mongolia, and delivering a resounding blow to the subversive plots of imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Mongolian modern revisionism. This is of great significance for consolidating our border regions, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, strengthening the unity of all nationalities in our country, and developing our socialist construction.

This is a decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, in Inner Mongolia! This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

We hereby express our highest respect and warmest congratulations to the revolutionary comrades and fellow fighters of the Inner Mongolia proletarian revolutionaries, and to the 13 million people of various nationalities in Inner Mongolia!

The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Revolutionary Committee is the result of the Inner Mongolia proletarian revolutionaries, under the loving care and wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the support and encouragement of the proletarian revolutionaries from all over the country, repeatedly contending and bravely fighting against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Inner Mongolia Party. The broad masses of the Inner Mongolia proletarian revolutionaries, in this heart-pounding class struggle, have been infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line, braving the dark winds and fierce waves, and passing severe tests. They have continuously strengthened their proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and created good conditions for achieving revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. The Inner Mongolia proletarian revolutionaries have established great merit for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Inner Mongolia region. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the Inner Mongolia region, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has, at critical moments, followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, stood forth, firmly and actively supported the proletarian revolutionaries, united with them, fought with them, and won the struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Inner Mongolia Party. The victory of the Inner Mongolia proletarian revolutionaries' seizure of power once again shows: no matter how sharp and complex the struggle is, no matter how great the obstacles and interference are, as long as Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is resolutely executed, and his great strategic deployment is closely followed, and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought is firmly established, there will be no failure.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees of our cause's victory."

Chairman Mao also says: "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle issue."

The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Inner Mongolia Party are feudal princes, nobles, landlords, and agents of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party. For a long time, they have been waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, frantically pushing the reactionary line of revisionism and nationalism, covering up class contradictions, inciting national relations, creating national splits, and undermining national unity. Their evil purpose is to restore capitalism to meet the needs of imperialism and modern revisionism.

The experience of the two classes, two roads, and two lines struggle in Inner Mongolia once again tells us: Chairman Mao's great theory and series of policies on the national question are the only correct guidelines for correctly handling national questions, and are the reliable guarantee for consolidating national unity. In our great socialist motherland, regardless of any nationality, the common ideological foundation is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; the common road is the road of socialism and communism. We must, with the class and class struggle viewpoint taught by Chairman Mao, correctly observe and handle national questions, and at any time, we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The forces of revolution are always advancing, and the forces of reaction are bound to fail. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Inner Mongolia region, after a tortuous and repeated process, has thoroughly exposed the true face of the class enemy, greatly tempered the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Now, the red sun illuminates the Inner Mongolia grasslands, and the revolutionary situation in Inner Mongolia is better than ever, and it will only get better in the future.

While celebrating the great victories we have already achieved, we should not forget that the domestic and foreign class enemies will never be content with their failure. They will continue to cause trouble. The military and people of Inner Mongolia, who are on the front line against revisionism, must be highly vigilant, strengthen their awareness of the enemy, timely expose and smash all the tricks and plots of the class enemy, consolidate the red power of the proletariat, and consolidate the borders of the motherland. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, and carry out the revolutionary criticism more deeply, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia, and thoroughly eliminate their poison. We must plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on every inch of the Inner Mongolia grasslands, and turn Inner Mongolia into a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

    红太阳照亮了内蒙古草原
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论
    从辽阔的内蒙古草原，传来了特大的喜讯。在我国北部边疆、反修前哨，内蒙古自治区革命委员会诞生了！
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会的成立，宣告了内蒙古地区的一小撮反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义分子的彻底垮台，斩断了他们的后台老板中国赫鲁晓夫伸向内蒙古的黑手，迎头痛击了帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和蒙古现代修正主义的颠覆阴谋。对于巩固我们边疆，巩固我国无产阶级专政，增强我国各民族的团结，发展我国社会主义建设，有着十分重大的意义。
    这是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命在内蒙古取得的决定性胜利！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们谨向内蒙古无产阶级革命派的同志们、战友们，向内蒙古一千三百万各族人民，致以崇高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺！
    内蒙古革命委员会的成立，是内蒙古无产阶级革命派，在毛主席亲切关怀和英明领导下，在全国各地无产阶级革命派的支持和鼓舞下，同内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反复较量和英勇斗争的结果。内蒙古广大的无产阶级革命派，在这场惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗中，无限忠于毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，顶黑风，战恶浪，经受住严重的考验。他们不断地增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，为实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合创造了良好条件。内蒙古无产阶级革命派为内蒙古地区的无产阶级文化大革命建立了功勋。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的驻内蒙古地区的人民解放军，在关键的时刻，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，挺身而出，坚定地、积极地支持无产阶级革命派，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利地进行了反对内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争。内蒙古无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，再一次表明：不管斗争多么尖锐复杂，不管有多大的阻力和干扰，只要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就无往而不胜。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    毛主席又说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”
    内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是混进党内的封建王公贵族、牧主、地主、资产阶级的代理人。他们长期以来打着红旗反红旗，疯狂地推行修正主义、民族分裂主义的反动路线，掩盖阶级矛盾，挑拨民族关系，制造民族分裂，破坏祖国统一。他们的罪恶目的，就是复辟资本主义，以适应帝国主义和现代修正主义的需要。
    内蒙古两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的经验再次告诉我们：毛主席关于民族问题的伟大理论和一系列方针政策，是正确处理民族问题的唯一正确的指南，是巩固祖国统一，增强民族团结的可靠保证。在我们伟大的社会主义祖国，不论哪一个民族，共同的思想基础，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想；共同的道路，就是社会主义、共产主义的道路。我们一定要以毛主席教导的阶级和阶级斗争观点，正确地观察和处理民族问题，任何时候都要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    革命的力量总是前进的，反动力量总是要失败的。内蒙古地区无产阶级文化大革命，经过一个曲折和反复，正好彻底暴露了阶级敌人的面目，大大锻炼了革命群众和革命干部。现在，红太阳照亮了内蒙古草原，内蒙古革命形势空前大好，今后还会越来越好。
    在欢庆我们已经取得伟大胜利的时候，我们不应该忘记，国内外阶级敌人是决不会甘心他们的失败的。他们还会捣乱再捣乱。处在反修前哨的内蒙古军民，必须高度警惕，加强敌情观念，及时揭穿和粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，巩固无产阶级的红色政权，巩固祖国的边疆。要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，更加深入地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人批倒批臭、批深批透，彻底肃清他们的流毒。把毛泽东思想伟大红旗，插遍内蒙古草原的每一寸土地，把内蒙古办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
