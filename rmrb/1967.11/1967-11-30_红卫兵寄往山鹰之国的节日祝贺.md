The 29th of November marks the 23rd anniversary of the liberation of heroic Albania.

We, the Red Guards of China, extend our warmest congratulations and revolutionary greetings to the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Hoxha, and to the heroic people of the Land of the Eagle!

This year, in June and July, I, as a member of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, participated in the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League and visited the heroic Land of the Eagle.

During our visit, we saw that the country was filled with the vigorous spirit of proletarian revolution and the surging tide of socialist construction. We constantly felt the boundless loyalty of the Albanian people and youth to the glorious Albanian Labor Party and its great leader, Comrade Hoxha, and their boundless love for our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao.

The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, held last winter, was a historic meeting of great significance. This congress formulated a program for achieving revolutionization, pushing Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction to a new stage. The call of the Fifth Congress, like a spring thunder, quickly spread throughout Albania's cities and villages, mountains, and plains. The heroic Albanian people resolutely responded to the call of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, launching a nationwide, vigorous campaign for further ideological revolutionization and a new high tide of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Albanian people, following the guidance of the Labor Party, carried out the slogan "think, work, and live like a revolutionary," and threw themselves into the great struggle on the ideological front, further advancing the revolutionization movement in the realm of ideology.

The Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has taken a series of revolutionary measures of great historical significance, fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Albanian people for socialist revolution, ensuring that heroic Albania advances victoriously along the socialist path. After Comrade Enver Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 and the announcement by the Albanian Labor Party and government on April 29, a new high tide of further deepening the revolutionization movement and the creative initiatives of the working masses has been launched in the Land of the Eagle. In this revolutionization movement, the heroic Albanian youth have always been at the forefront. They posted the first revolutionary lightning report (big-character poster), launching a fierce attack on bureaucracy and old customs. Revolutionary students from Albanian universities and colleges, following the party's guidance, took up pickaxes and went to the fields, took up tools and went to the factories, resolutely combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, tempering and transforming themselves through labor.

Under the guidance and nurturing of the party, in the heroic Albanian People's Army, in the highly politically conscious and revolutionary spirit of the working class, and in the thriving younger generation, new communist people are emerging. Adam Reka, Muhaqem Heti, Murtez Kepi, Qazim Haxhiu, Vath Keleshi, and many other heroic figures have become eternal examples inspiring the Albanian people to press forward bravely.

Whether in the glorious capital of Albania, Tirana, or in the "Port of Sino-Albanian Friendship," Durres; whether in the southern heroic city of Vlora, or in the northern stronghold of Shkodra, the central city of Berat, the Chinese Red Guards delegation was warmly welcomed everywhere. Wherever we went, the thunderous cheers of "Enver-Mao Zedong!" and "Long live the Red Guards!" echoed.

The Albanian people and youth enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and strongly supported the Red Guards movement. We visited the "Mao Zedong Textile Combine" in Berat. The workers of this factory had written a letter to the revolutionary masses of Shanghai during the "January Revolution" storm, expressing their enthusiastic support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On a voluntary labor site, a student from a normal school recited a poem titled "Salute to the Chinese Red Guards," expressing the boundless enthusiasm of Albanian youth for the Chinese Red Guards. The poem reads:

"The sky is clear and the sun rises in the east,
Its rays shine brightly, illuminating the land.
The warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought
—Red Guards, I salute you!"

The love of the Albanian people and youth for Comrade Hoxha and Chairman Mao is indescribable. I remember when we visited the tobacco factory in Durres, in the packaging workshop, when we met with the workers, they cheered "Enver-Mao Zedong" for five minutes. The Albanian comrades regarded the shining Mao badges, Mao's embroidered portraits, and photographs as the most precious gifts. In Shkodra, a young worker was very excited when he received the Mao portrait we gave him. He expressed his boundless love for Chairman Mao in enthusiastic words. He said, "I will hang this portrait together with Comrade Hoxha's portrait on my bed, looking at them every day and thinking of them every day."

During this visit, I deeply felt that the friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two youth of China and Albania is profound and sincere revolutionary friendship. As Chairman Mao said, "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades." All imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries will be smashed to pieces in the face of our iron-like unity.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Today, in Albania, where the revolutionization movement is being carried out, this beacon stands firmly on the Adriatic Sea, surrounded by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, shining with even more brilliant and dazzling light, becoming the hope of the revolutionary people of Europe.

The great Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Hoxha, said: "Albania was born in revolution, Albania fights through revolution, and Albania achieved victory through revolution. We will also enter communism through revolution." The Chinese people and revolutionary Red Guards firmly believe that the bright red flag of Albania will be even more brilliant in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, and will forever fly high!

    红卫兵寄往山鹰之国的节日祝贺
    上海同济大学　陈敢峰
    十一月二十九日，是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年。
    我们中国红卫兵向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，向以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向山鹰之国的英雄人民，致以热烈的节日祝贺和无产阶级革命的敬礼！
    今年六、七月间，我作为中国红卫兵代表团的一员，参加了阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会，并且参观和访问了英雄的山鹰之国。
    在访问中，我们看到这个国家到处洋溢着蓬勃的无产阶级革命的精神，到处激荡着高涨的社会主义建设的热潮；我们时刻感到阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年对光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的无限忠诚，对我们的伟大领袖、世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党去年冬天举行的第五次代表大会，是具有伟大历史意义的大会。这次大会制定了实现革命化的纲领，它把阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向一个新的阶段。“五大”的号召，象一声春雷，迅速地传遍了阿尔巴尼亚的城市和乡村，山区和平原。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，坚决地响应劳动党和霍查同志的号召，在全国轰轰烈烈地开展了进一步思想革命化运动，掀起了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民遵循劳动党的教导，执行“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的口号，投入思想战线上的巨大斗争中去，进一步开展意识形态领域里的革命化运动。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取的一系列具有重大历史意义的革命化措施，充分调动了阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义革命积极性，保证了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚沿着社会主义道路胜利前进。在今年二月六日恩维尔·霍查同志的纲领性讲话和四月二十九日阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府发表了公告以后，在山鹰之国又掀起了进一步深入开展革命化运动和劳动群众创造性倡议的新高潮。在这场革命化运动中，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚青年一直站在最前列。他们贴出了第一张革命的闪电报（大字报），向官僚主义和旧习俗展开猛烈的进攻。阿尔巴尼亚大专院校革命的青年学生，遵循党的教导，拿起铁镐走向田头，拿起工具走向工厂，坚决与工农兵相结合，在劳动中锻炼和改造自己。
    在党的教导和孕育下，在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军中，在具有高度政治觉悟和革命精神的工人阶级队伍中，在茁壮成长的青年一代中，共产主义新人辈出。亚当·雷卡、穆哈梅特·希胡、穆尔特扎·凯皮、恰齐姆·哈斯米、弗阿特·采拉等许多英雄人物，成为永远激励阿尔巴尼亚人民奋勇前进的光辉榜样。
    无论是在阿尔巴尼亚光荣的首都地拉那，还是在“中阿友谊港”都拉斯；无论是在南方的英雄城市发罗那，还是在北方重镇斯库台、中部城市培拉特，中国红卫兵代表团到处都受到热烈的欢迎。我们走到哪里，哪里就响起“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“红卫兵万岁！”的春雷一般的欢呼声。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命，热情支持中国红卫兵运动。我们访问了培拉特的“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”，这个工厂的职工，在上海“一月革命”风暴中，就曾经写信给上海无产阶级革命派，对我国无产阶级文化大革命表示热烈的支持。在一个义务劳动的工地上，一位师范学校的学生朗诵了一首题为《向中国红卫兵致敬》的诗，表达了阿尔巴尼亚青年对中国红卫兵的无限热情。诗中写道：
    “长空万里无云，一轮红日东升，
    光芒万丈，照耀得遍地通红。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士
    ——红卫兵，我向你们致敬！”
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年对霍查同志和毛主席的热爱是难以用语言形容的。记得我们访问都拉斯市烟草工厂，在包装车间同工人同志们见面时，他们欢呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”长达五分钟之久。阿尔巴尼亚的同志们把金光闪闪的毛主席像章、毛主席的织锦像和照片，看作是最珍贵的礼物。在斯库台，一位青年工人接到我们赠给他的毛主席照片时，十分激动。他用热情的语言表达了对毛主席的无限热爱。他说：“我要把这张照片和霍查同志的照片一起贴在我的床头上，天天看着，天天想着。”
    在这次访问中，我深深体会到中阿两党、两国人民和两国青年之间的友谊，是深厚的真挚的革命友谊。正如毛主席所说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。”一切帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，必将在我们这种钢铁般的团结面前碰得头破血流。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”今天，在进行革命化运动的阿尔巴尼亚，这盏明灯在受帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派包围的亚得里亚海边，巍然屹立，发出更加灿烂夺目的光辉，成为欧洲革命人民的希望。
    伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志说：“阿尔巴尼亚在革命中诞生，阿尔巴尼亚通过革命进行斗争，通过革命取得了社会主义的胜利。我们也将通过革命进入共产主义”。中国人民和革命的红卫兵坚信，阿尔巴尼亚这面鲜艳的红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争中，定将更加鲜艳，永远高高飘扬！
