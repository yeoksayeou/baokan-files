The Soviet revisionist clique, in the so-called “celebration” of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, have been trying to portray themselves as the “loyal successors” of the October Revolution. However, false is false, and all disguises cannot conceal the traitorous faces of this bunch of renegades. Over the years, they have betrayed the path of the October Revolution and committed the crime of vigorously advocating and implementing the “peaceful transition” line, thus exposing their traitorous features.

Marxism-Leninism has always openly declared the inevitability of violent revolution, pointing out that the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution is to take the path of violent revolution, to seize power through armed struggle, and to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: “The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power by armed force, to solve problems through war.” “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.” Chairman Mao’s famous statements are universal truths.

Fifty years ago, the October Socialist Revolution in Russia was a great revolution that solved the problem of the proletariat seizing power through “war.” This revolution showed the peoples of all countries that the proletariat seizing power through armed struggle is the inevitable path from capitalism to socialism. The modern Soviet revisionists, from Khrushchev to Brezhnev and Kosygin, have betrayed the path of the October Revolution, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, and have strenuously denied the universal significance of the October Revolution path, opposed violent revolution, and advocated a “peaceful transition” from capitalism to socialism. At the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956, Khrushchev proposed the line of “transition to socialism through the parliamentary road,” that is, the “peaceful transition” line. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has completely inherited this legacy.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, like preachers spreading the “gospel,” have been desperately preaching the “peaceful transition.” They have been loudly proclaiming that the opportunity for “peaceful transition to socialism” has “increased many times” compared to the past, and that under current conditions, the working class in various capitalist countries has the prospect of “seizing power without domestic war,” and so on.

This year, they took the opportunity of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution to further sing the praises of the “peaceful transition” line. They issued documents in the name of the “CPSU Central Committee” and published numerous articles in newspapers, shamelessly distorting the path of the October Revolution, distorting the reality of class struggle in contemporary times, and desperately peddling the “peaceful transition” poison. These documents and articles, when discussing the path of the October Revolution and its international significance, strongly oppose violent revolution. They use the excuse that the proletarian party must adopt “flexible strategies” and the excuse of changes in the balance of class forces to sing the praises of “peaceful struggle methods” and “peaceful struggle forms” for transitioning to socialism. They advocate that the “parliamentary road can become one form of revolutionary peaceful development”; they advocate that without the proletariat seizing power, “without the direct leadership of the proletariat,” it is “possible to advance towards socialism.” They recently even published an article by the leader of the French revisionists, Roger, in *Izvestia*, openly shouting that it is possible to “transition to socialism through a different path from that taken by the Russian working people,” that is, the path of the October Revolution.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique have also repeated Khrushchev’s old tricks, trying their best to paint the October Revolution with a “peaceful” color. Khrushchev and his ilk once openly advocated that the October Revolution was “almost peacefully completed” in order to deny the proletarian violent revolution. The Soviet revisionist magazine *Kommunist* in its tenth issue this year shamelessly described the October Revolution as a “rare bloodless” revolution. Articles in *Krasnaya Zvezda* on May 27 this year and in the second issue of *Voprosy Filosofii* this year even went so far as to say that “the socialist revolution does not necessarily include armed violence as a factor, its content is economic and political change.” “If the bourgeoisie is convinced that armed resistance is hopeless,” it will “peacefully surrender power.”

Over the years, this small clique of traitors to the proletariat has been trying every means in the international arena to implement the so-called “peaceful transition” counter-revolutionary line, to corrupt the revolutionary will of the peoples of various countries, and to disrupt the revolutionary struggles of the working class and revolutionary peoples of various countries.

In Europe, they have been vigorously advocating the “parliamentary road” of the so-called “peaceful transition” to socialism by the French, Italian, and other countries’ revisionist cliques, and have held up their activities in this regard as revolutionary actions of “principled significance” for communists in all countries, urging others to follow their example. In Asia, they have been singing the praises of the “peaceful transition” line implemented by the revisionist scoundrels like the Danjie clique in India. They have praised the so-called “socialist program” of the Ne Win reactionary clique in Burma to the skies, saying that Burma has “begun the transition to socialism” under the rule of the Ne Win clique, using Ne Win’s fake socialism to deceive the Burmese people; at the same time, they have collaborated with Ne Win to make the Burmese Communist Party abandon armed struggle, just like the Indian revisionists, to take the road of “peaceful development” and “peaceful transition.” In Latin America, they have been pushing the “parliamentary road” and “peaceful transition” poison, inciting some revisionist cliques in Latin America to disrupt the armed struggles of the peoples of this continent against the United States and against dictatorship.

The black hand of the Soviet revisionist leadership in pushing the “peaceful transition” line has also reached into Africa. The discussion meeting on “Africa: National and Social Revolution” they organized last October is a recent example of their peddling of the “peaceful transition” poison in Africa.

On the eve of the October Revolution, the great Lenin warned people: overthrowing the bourgeoisie’s rule cannot be achieved through “self-dissolution,” and according to general rules, it can only be achieved through violent revolution. In the years after the October Revolution, Lenin repeatedly stressed the inevitability of violent revolution. He said, “There has never been a revolution in history that did not involve civil war, and there has never been a true Marxist who thought that it was possible to transition from capitalism to socialism without civil war.” The Soviet revisionist leadership, with their constant talk of “peaceful transition” and their constant discussion of the possibility of the working class “seizing power without civil war,” their beautification of the bourgeoisie, their saying that they “will peacefully surrender power,” and their peddling of this kind of revisionist opium everywhere, and their deliberate attempt to portray the October Revolution as a “peaceful revolution,” is this not a shameless betrayal of Lenin and the cause of the October Revolution?

The gang of labor traitors in the Kremlin use the changes in the balance of class forces in recent decades as an excuse for their “peaceful transition” line. However, the ruthless facts of history are: in the half-century since the October Revolution, in all the continents of the world, people have not seen a single country that has peacefully transitioned from capitalism to socialism, but rather have seen many countries where the communist parties, due to pursuing “peaceful transition,” have suffered serious setbacks in their revolutions. In France and Italy, the revisionist elements like Thorez and Togliatti, who were determined to take the “parliamentary road,” squandered the great victories and excellent revolutionary situation that the peoples of these two countries had won through armed struggle during World War II. In India, the Danjie traitor clique and the likes of Nambudripad have been pursuing the “peaceful transition” line for many years. The result is that they betrayed the armed struggles of the peasants in Telangana and other regions from 1946 to 1951, and themselves have become tools of the reactionary Indian National Congress government in oppressing and exploiting the people. In Iraq, the once revolutionary-minded Iraqi Communist Party, due to external pressure, was forced to accept Khrushchev’s “peaceful transition” revisionist line. As a result, in the recent counter-revolutionary armed coup, they were caught off guard, and tens of thousands of Iraqi Communist Party members and revolutionary masses were massacred, causing serious losses to the revolutionary cause in Iraq.

All these experiences and lessons have ruthlessly exposed that Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin and this small clique of scoundrels are not the “loyal successors” of the October Revolution, but are a bunch of well-dressed political swindlers. It is clear that their so-called “peaceful transition” is to oppose revolution and to maintain capitalist rule in the capitalist world.

Experience and lessons have also educated the revolutionary peoples of the whole world, making them deeply understand the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on the proletarian revolution, understand the correctness of Chairman Mao’s famous statement that “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” and understand that to overthrow the old world and establish a new socialist world, one must take the path of the October Revolution and take up arms to struggle. The “peaceful transition” poison peddlers like Brezhnev and his ilk, whether they deceive or sabotage, will absolutely not be able to stop this revolutionary trend.

    拚命推销“和平过渡”黑货　妄图扼杀各国人民革命斗争
    苏修集团彻底背叛十月革命道路
    据新华社七日讯　本社记者述评：苏修领导集团在所谓“庆祝”十月革命五十周年的活动中，一心想把自己装扮成十月革命事业的“忠实继承者”。然而假的就是假的，一切伪装都掩饰不了他们这一伙叛徒的面目。多年来，他们背叛十月革命的道路，拚命鼓吹和推行“和平过渡”路线的罪行，就揭穿了他们的叛徒嘴脸。
    马克思列宁主义一向公开声明暴力革命的必然性，指出无产阶级革命的根本问题，就是走暴力革命的道路，通过武装斗争夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“枪杆子里面出政权”。毛主席的这些著名论断，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。
    五十年前在俄国发生的十月社会主义革命，就是用“战争解决”无产阶级夺取政权问题的一次非常伟大的革命。这次革命给各国人民指出，无产阶级通过武装斗争夺取政权，是由资本主义过渡到社会主义的必由之路。苏联现代修正主义者，从赫鲁晓夫到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，背叛十月革命的道路，背叛马克思列宁主义，极力否认十月革命道路的普遍意义，反对暴力革命，鼓吹从资本主义“和平过渡”到社会主义。赫鲁晓夫在一九五六年召开的苏共二十大上，提出“通过议会的道路向社会主义过渡”，即“和平过渡”的路线。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团完全继承了他的这一衣钵。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团象传播“福音”的神甫一样，拚命进行“和平过渡”的说教。他们大肆宣扬什么现在通过“和平的道路过渡到社会主义”的机会比过去“增加了很多倍”，在目前条件下，各资本主义国家的工人阶级有了“不经过国内战争取得政权的前景”等等。
    在今年，他们乘十月革命五十周年的机会，进一步为“和平过渡”路线大唱颂歌。他们用“苏共中央”的名义发表文件，通过报纸大量发表文章，无耻地歪曲十月革命的道路，歪曲当代阶级斗争的现实，拚命贩卖“和平过渡”的黑货。这些文件和文章，在谈到十月革命道路和它的国际意义时，极力反对暴力革命。他们借口无产阶级政党要采用“灵活策略”，借口阶级力量对比的变化，百般颂扬“和平斗争手段”和向社会主义过渡的“和平斗争形式”。他们宣扬“议会道路，可以成为革命和平发展的形式之一”；宣扬不经过无产阶级夺取政权，“没有无产阶级的直接领导”，也“有可能向社会主义前进”。他们最近还在《消息报》发表法修头子罗歇的文章，公开叫嚷“通过不同于俄国劳动人民所走过的道路”，即十月革命的道路，“向社会主义过渡”。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团还重演赫鲁晓夫的故技，费尽心机想为十月革命涂上一层“和平”的色彩。赫鲁晓夫之流当年为了否定无产阶级暴力革命，曾公然宣扬十月革命“几乎是和平完成的”。而苏修《共产党人》杂志今年第十期的一篇文章也无耻地把十月革命说成是一次“罕见的不流血的”革命。《红星报》今年五月二十七日、《哲学问题》杂志今年第二期发表文章，甚至胡说什么“社会主义革命不包含武装暴力这样一个必然因素，它的内容是经济与政治变革。”“如果资产阶级确信武装反抗是没有希望的”，它就“会和平地让出政权”。
    赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一小撮无产阶级的叛徒，多年来在国际上千方百计推行所谓“和平过渡”的反革命路线，来腐蚀各国人民的革命意志，破坏各国工人阶级和革命人民的革命斗争。
    他们在欧洲卖劲地鼓吹法国、意大利等国的修正主义集团所谓向社会主义“和平过渡”的“议会道路”，并把它们在这方面的活动标榜成“对一切国家的共产党人来说是有原则性意义”的革命行动，要别人效法。在亚洲，他们对印度的丹吉集团之类的修正主义败类推行“和平过渡”路线大加颂扬。他们把缅甸奈温反动集团的所谓“社会主义纲领”捧上了天，说缅甸在奈温集团的统治下，已“开始向社会主义过渡”，用奈温的假社会主义欺骗缅甸人民；同时，配合奈温要缅甸共产党放弃武装斗争，象印度修正主义分子一样走“和平发展”、“和平过渡”道路。他们在拉丁美洲也一直在推销“议会道路”、“和平过渡”的黑货，唆使拉丁美洲一些修正主义集团破坏这个大陆各国人民反美、反独裁的武装斗争。
    苏修领导集团推行“和平过渡”路线的黑手，同样也伸进了非洲。去年十月间他们一手策划举行的名为“非洲：民族和社会革命”的讨论会，就是他们在非洲推销“和平过渡”黑货方面最近的一个例证。
    十月革命前夕，伟大的列宁曾告诫人们：推翻资产阶级统治，是不能经过“自行消亡”来实现的，根据一般规律，只能靠暴力革命来实现。在十月革命以后几年中，列宁又多次反复强调暴力革命的必然性。他说，“历史上从来没有过一次不经过国内战争的大革命，并且也没有一个真正的马克思主义者会认为，不经过国内战争就能从资本主义过渡到社会主义。”苏修领导集团口口声声“和平过渡”，开口闭口大谈工人阶级“不经过国内战争取得政权”的可能性，美化资产阶级，说他们“会和平地让出政权”，到处兜售这类修正主义鸦片，而且处心积虑想把十月革命说成也是一次“和平革命”，这不是对列宁和十月革命事业的无耻背叛又能是什么呢！
    克里姆林宫中这帮工贼把最近几十年阶级力量对比的变化作为他们实行“和平过渡”路线的一个借口。然而，无情的历史事实是：在十月革命后这半个世纪的悠长岁月里，在世界各大洲，人们没有看到有任何一个国家从资本主义和平过渡到社会主义的先例，相反倒是经历了不少国家的共产党由于搞“和平过渡”而使革命遭到严重挫折的教训。在法国和意大利，多列士、陶里亚蒂之流的修正主义分子一心要走“议会道路”，断送了这两个国家的人民在第二次世界大战期间通过武装斗争赢得的伟大胜利果实和大好革命形势。在印度，丹吉叛徒集团和南布迪里巴德之流，多年来也是推行“和平过渡”路线的。结果是，他们叛卖了一九四六年至一九五一年期间在特仑甘纳等地区的农民武装斗争，而自己也完全成了国大党反动政府压迫和剥削人民的工具。在伊拉克，曾经充满了革命朝气的伊拉克共产党，由于外来压力，迫使他们接受了赫鲁晓夫“和平过渡”修正主义路线。结果，在几年前的反革命武装政变中措手不及，成千上万的伊共党员和革命群众惨遭杀害，伊拉克的革命事业受到严重损失。
    所有这一切经验和教训都无情地揭穿了赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一小撮败类根本不是十月革命事业的“忠实继承者”，而只是一帮衣冠楚楚的政治骗子。十分清楚，他们所谓“和平过渡”，就是反对革命，就是在资本主义世界维护资本主义统治。
    经验和教训也教育了全世界革命人民，使他们深深地认识到马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于无产阶级革命的学说的正确性，认识到毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断的正确性，认识到要推翻旧世界，建立社会主义的新江山，就得走十月革命的道路，拿起武器进行斗争。勃列日涅夫之流的“和平过渡”黑货贩子，欺骗也罢，破坏也罢，都绝对阻挡不了这样的革命趋势。
