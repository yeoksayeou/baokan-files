Wide Ranges of Cadres Actively Participate in Collective Production Labor

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 30 (Xinhua) -- Under the personal guidance of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Party of Labor of Albania and the Albanian people, the wide ranges of cadres in Albania have been carrying out the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. This system has played a great role in overcoming bureaucratism, preventing revisionism and dogmatism, promoting the revolutionization of cadres' ideology, and strengthening the ties between cadres and the masses.

	The cadres at various levels in Albania began to participate in collective production labor several years ago. After the open letter to the people of the whole country was issued by the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania last spring, this revolutionary measure was further carried out. After the successful conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, the wide ranges of cadres, under the guidance and encouragement of the decisions of the Fifth Congress, have participated in production labor more actively, and many advanced units and advanced workers have emerged. The cadres of the Tershani Agricultural Cooperative in the district of Lezhe have put forward the initiative of doing one hundred labor days each year, and the cadres and technical personnel of the Enver Mechanical Factory in Tirana have put forward the revolutionary initiative of participating in one hundred and twenty labor days each year, which has been warmly responded to throughout the country. At present, the political enthusiasm and initiative of Albanian cadres to participate in collective labor are unprecedentedly high, the system of cadres participating in collective labor is becoming more and more sound, and the ties between cadres and the masses are becoming more and more extensive, frequent and close.

	The leading cadres and technical personnel of the Durres Agricultural Machinery Factory began to implement the system of cadres participating in labor from December last year, stipulating that each person should participate in one hundred and twenty days of physical labor each year, and that each person should learn and master one production technology within two years, and established a chart to check the labor situation of cadres in the corridors of the workshops and factories. The director of the factory, Sabri Cevani, a member of the Party of Labor, goes to work with the workers and works with them. After work, he takes on the heavy task of leadership. This year in March, in addition to continuing to participate in labor, he moved his bed to the factory and spent the night in his office, thus greatly improving the relations between the cadres and the masses. The workers of this factory, in order to improve production efficiency, had asked the leadership to increase the number of people working on the production die from two to seven or eight, and to set up a special production group. However, the leadership, not understanding the production situation, refused to increase the number of people. After the cadres participated in labor, they quickly recognized through investigation and research that the suggestions put forward by the workers were very reasonable, and adopted the reasonable suggestions put forward by the workers, thus doubling the production efficiency.

	The Enver Mechanical Factory, which put forward the initiative for leading cadres and technical personnel to spend one-third of their time each year participating in labor, has sixty leading cadres and technical personnel, of whom three can only do sixty-five labor days each year due to special circumstances, and the rest each do one hundred labor days each year. Through participating in labor, they have greatly changed their leadership style, overcome bureaucratism, and replaced it with new, revolutionary methods and styles of work.

	The wide ranges of cadres in the districts of Lezhe, Shkodra, etc., have actively responded to the initiative of the cadres of the Tershani Agricultural Cooperative to do one hundred labor days each year, and have achieved remarkable results. Many cadres from the chairman of the agricultural cooperative to the production team leader have completed the labor quota for the first half of the year, and some have even exceeded the quota. Chairman Temal Caci of the Somane Agricultural Cooperative in the district of Kruja said: "We work with the members and turn the labor site into a battlefield for tempering our ideology, and build a wall to prevent the generation of bureaucratism, so that we are free from all bad things. Only by working with the members, by sweating with them, by tempering ourselves in the wind and rain, can we strengthen the correct revolutionary standpoint. Only by working with the members can we fight against the bad style of arrogance and self-satisfaction, overcome the tendency of commandism, the desire for ease, and all the old remnants in our minds." The chairman of the Kakaric Agricultural Cooperative in the district of Lezhe said: "Working with the members has helped us improve our work methods and styles. In labor, through contact with everyone, we have heard the precious opinions and criticisms of the members." The cadres of the Mulloje Agricultural Cooperative in the district of Shkodra actively take the lead in participating in production labor, and the members, under the influence and encouragement of the cadres, are making a big push for grain production and are expected to achieve grain self-sufficiency this year.

	The cadres at various levels in Albania have also followed the teachings of Marxism-Leninism on the importance of investigation and research, with the main leading cadres taking the lead, forming work teams, and going deep into the grassroots to conduct social investigations, and then formulating correct fighting strategies. A work team led by Comrade Temal Dini, Secretary of the Shkodra District Committee, went deep into the northern mountainous area and worked with the youth building the mountain highway, studied the implementation of the decision of the Party Central Committee on rural issues in June 1963, and drew conclusions on the basis of investigation and research. The Party Committee of Tirana sent out four work teams, and a work team led by Comrade Laci Yfdiqta, Secretary of the Party Committee, went to several agricultural cooperatives to work, investigate, and study, and improved the work methods and organizational construction of the grassroots Party organizations in the countryside. The District Committee of Gjirokastra sent out seven work teams to the countryside to conduct social investigations, solved some problems and contradictions among the people in the current countryside, and vigorously promoted the in-depth development of the women's liberation movement.

	Many leading organs have recently held meetings to check and summarize the situation of cadres participating in labor in the first half of the year, and have taken new measures to further carry out the system of cadres participating in labor. The District Committee of Fier held a standing committee meeting on July 22, had a heated discussion, found out the shortcomings in participating in labor in the previous stage, revised the quota for participating in labor, and re-studied the situation of implementation in early August, and submitted it to the masses for discussion on August 10. The meeting also decided to publish the results of cadres participating in labor every fifteen days.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, pointed out: "Any phenomenon that despises and belittles physical labor should be regarded as despising and belittling workers, peasants, and the broad masses of the people. This will lead to alienation from the people, alienation from labor, and alienation from the life of the people. This is the root of all evil." At present, the wide ranges of cadres in Albania are seriously studying and implementing the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha, striving to practice, and striving to achieve greater results on the road of revolutionization.

    克服官僚主义　防止修正主义　密切联系群众　促进思想革命化
    阿广大干部积极参加集体生产劳动
    新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚广大干部在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的亲切教导下，坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，对于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义、促进干部思想革命化，以及密切群众和干部的联系起着极大的作用。
    阿尔巴尼亚各级干部早在几年前就已经开始参加集体生产劳动。去年春天阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央致全国人民的公开信发表以后，这一革命化措施得到了进一步贯彻执行。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会胜利闭幕以后，广大干部在五大决议的照耀和鼓舞下，更加积极地参加生产劳动，涌现出许多先进单位和先进工作者。莱希区特拉沙尼农业合作社干部提出每年做一百个劳动日，地拉那恩维尔机械厂干部和工程技术人员提出每年参加一百二十天劳动的革命倡议，得到了全国各地的热烈响应。目前，阿尔巴尼亚干部参加集体劳动的政治热情和积极性空前高涨，干部参加集体劳动的制度越来越健全，干部同群众的联系也日益广泛、经常和密切了。
    都拉斯农业机械厂的领导干部和工程技术人员，从去年十二月份开始贯彻干部参加劳动的制度，规定每人每年参加体力劳动一百二十天，规定每人在两年之内学会并掌握一门生产技术，并在车间厂房的走廊里建立了考核干部劳动情况的图表。这个厂的厂长、劳动党员萨勃利·切瓦尼，同工人一起上班，一起劳动。下班后，他又担负起繁重的领导工作。今年三月，他除了一直坚持参加劳动外，并把床铺搬到工厂，在他的办公室里过夜，这样就大大改善了干群关系。这个厂的工人为了提高生产效率，曾要求领导上将生产冲模的人数从二人增到七至八人，成立一个专门的生产小组。但是领导上不了解生产情况，拒绝增加人数。干部参加劳动之后，经过调查研究很快认识到工人们提出的建议是非常合理的，便采纳了工人们提出的合理建议，使生产效率提高了两倍。
    提出领导干部和工程技术人员每年用三分之一的时间参加劳动的倡议的恩维尔机械厂，六十名领导干部和工程技术人员中，除三人因特殊情况每年只能做六十五个劳动日以外，其余每人每年都要做一百个劳动日。通过参加劳动，他们大大地改变了领导作风，克服了官僚主义，而代之以新的、革命的工作方法和工作作风。
    莱希、斯库台等区的广大农业社干部，积极响应特拉沙尼农业社干部提出的每人每年做一百个劳动日的倡议，取得了显著成绩。许多从农业社主席到生产队长一级的干部，胜利地完成了上半年的劳动定额，有的还超过了定额。克鲁亚区索马涅农业社主席捷马尔·恰奇说：“我们和社员一起劳动，把劳动场所变成了锻炼思想的阵地，并筑起了一道防止产生官僚主义的围墙，使我们免受一切坏东西的侵蚀。我们每个干部只有同社员一起流汗，在风里雨里摔打自己，才能加强正确的革命观点。只有和社员一起劳动，才能和骄傲自满的坏作风作斗争，克服命令主义、贪图安逸的倾向和思想当中的一切旧的残余。”莱希区卡卡里奇农业社主席说：“与社员共同劳动，帮助我们改进了工作方法和作风。在劳动中，通过和大家接触，我们听到了社员们的宝贵意见和批评。”斯库台区穆洛耶农业社的干部积极带头参加生产劳动，社员们在干部的影响和带动下，大搞粮食生产，可在今年实现粮食自给。
    阿尔巴尼亚各级干部还在参加劳动的过程中，遵循马克思列宁主义关于要注重调查研究的教导，由主要领导干部亲自出马，组成工作组，深入基层进行社会调查，然后定出正确的斗争策略。由斯库台区委书记捷马尔·迪尼同志率领的工作组，深入北部山区，和修筑大山公路的青年一起劳动，研究一九六三年六月党中央关于农村问题的决议的贯彻情况，并在调查研究的基础上得出了结论。地拉那党委派出了四个工作组，由党委书记拉奇·依弗迪察同志率领的工作组，到几个农业社边劳动，边调查，边研究，改进了农村党基层组织的工作方法和组织建设。纪诺卡斯特区委派出七个工作组到农村作社会调查，解决了当前农村中存在的一些问题和人民内部矛盾，有力地推动了妇女解放运动的深入开展。
    许多领导机关最近召开会议，检查和总结了上半年干部参加劳动的情况，采取了新的措施，以进一步贯彻执行干部参加劳动的制度。费里区委在七月二十二日召开常委会议，进行了热烈讨论，找出了前一阶段在参加劳动方面所存在的缺点，对参加劳动的定额作了修正，在八月初重行研究了贯彻执行的情况，并在八月十日提交群众讨论。会议还决定每十五天公布一次干部参加劳动的结果。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志指出：“任何轻视和贬低体力劳动的现象，都应当看成是轻视和贬低工人、农民、广大人民群众。这将导致脱离人民、脱离劳动和脱离人民生活。这是万恶之源。”目前，阿尔巴尼亚广大干部正在认真学习和贯彻霍查同志的教导，努力实践，争取在革命化的道路上做出更大的成绩来。
