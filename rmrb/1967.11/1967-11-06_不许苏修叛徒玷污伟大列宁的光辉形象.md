The Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed Lenin and betrayed Marxism-Leninism. However, the Soviet revisionist clique claims to be the "successors" of Lenin, arrogantly posing as "Leninists."

Lenin pointed out long ago: "The theoretical victory of Marxism has forced its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists; such is the dialectic of history." Similarly, the brilliant victories of Leninism around the world have forced the Soviet revisionist clique to desperately disguise themselves as "supporters" of Lenin and further to use Lenin's name to oppose Marxism-Leninism.

Revisionist literature is a tool of revisionist politics. When the Soviet revisionist traitors, under the banner of Lenin, launched a full-scale counter-revolution in the Soviet Union and restored capitalism, a batch of so-called "creations" on the theme of Lenin, serving revisionist politics, emerged on the Soviet literary scene. The poisonous weeds that distorted the great image of Lenin, which were produced in large numbers after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, are the products of the 20th Congress and an inseparable part of the Soviet revisionist political line.

Lenin is the revolutionary teacher of the proletariat. Lenin's life is the life of a great revolutionary of the proletariat. Stalin once vividly described the great image of Lenin. He said: "Lenin was born for the revolution.... He felt most at ease and happy in times of revolutionary upheaval," Lenin "is a leader of the highest type, a mountain eagle."

But the Soviet revisionist traitors, for their shameful political purposes, brazenly distorted Lenin, claiming that "Lenin is also a person" and even the "most human person," and vigorously advocating that Lenin should be "described as a person." A writer named Kazakevich shouted: "Because I am an artist, not a historian, my task is to describe Lenin as a person."

Well, let's see what kind of "person" these revisionist writers have "described" Lenin as?

In the first film script distorting Lenin, produced after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, "The Last Autumn," there are scenes where Lenin talks to a 17-year-old nurse, Sasha, about his "love history"; such as "I frankly tell you, I fell in love at first sight," "After eating the fifth pancake, I fell in love," "Without Natasha, I could not live," and so on. These shameless fabrications have completely tarnished Lenin's image.

"Lenin is also a person," so Lenin must also "laugh, hate, and grieve like everyone else," and must also "be saddened by mistakes." Thus, in Kazakevich's "The Blue Notebook," which is praised by the Soviet revisionists as the best work depicting Lenin's image, there are as many as twenty places where Lenin is described as "sad and melancholic." This traitorous revisionist writer, with malicious intent, has deliberately portrayed Lenin as a sentimentalist with a "heart full of sadness and loneliness." This is a pure desecration of the great Lenin!

"Lenin is also a person," and those feudal emperors and noble poets are also "people." Thus, the famous Bogatin shouted that one can "write about Lenin like A. Tolstoy wrote about Peter the Great," and the young poet Voznesensky, who has just emerged, even went mad, saying: "Perhaps, that Lermontov... in a moment, that is Lenin." How absurd!

"Lenin is also a person," so the Soviet reactionary writers each showed their skills, exaggerating Lenin's so-called "humanity." Some even openly fabricated history, creating myths about how Lenin was tolerant and forgiving to class enemies. The entire plot of Kazakevich's short story "The Enemy" is about how Lenin, behind the backs of the People's Commissars, tried every means to send the Menshevik leader Martov abroad, making this "enemy" of the revolution escape the just judgment of the Soviet people.

Everything is clear. Their advocacy of "describing Lenin as a person" is to fundamentally distort the great image of Lenin, to adapt to the Soviet revisionist clique's revisionist political line and to serve their bourgeois dictatorship.

Soon after the 22nd Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the old rightist Shelyvinsky's play "A Man Above His Fate" emerged. This script's distortion of Lenin is shocking. A character in the play asks Lenin, "What is Marxism?" This Lenin replies, "It is not people for the revolution, but the revolution for people." And what is communism? This Lenin says, "Love for people—this is communism." Anyone with eyes can see that this nonsense is copied from Khrushchev's propaganda of false communism.

Stein's play "Between Storms" is about the rebellion that broke out in Kronstadt in the spring of 1921. Regarding this counter-revolutionary rebellion, Lenin said clearly that it was the work of "Social Revolutionaries and White Guards abroad"; but Stein portrayed this rebellion as a spontaneous mutiny by sailors due to severe economic difficulties, so the Lenin in the play thought of the need to "immediately change the economic policy" and immediately implement the "New Economic Policy."

Why did Stein make the Lenin in the play advocate "changing the economic policy"? The reason is that the Khrushchev clique wants to "change the economic policy," bringing the Soviet economy completely onto the capitalist track and fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. To add a layer of "Leninism" to their traitorous faces, Khrushchev shamelessly compared his revisionist line to Lenin's New Economic Policy at the 22nd Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, with ulterior motives, letting his representatives "remember that after the end of the civil war, V.I. Lenin, with his characteristic insight and courage, immediately demanded a fundamental change in policy, sharply shifting the lever from the war communism system to the New Economic Policy."

The Soviet revisionist clique implemented a series of revisionist lines, causing serious damage to the socialist economy of the Soviet Union. These wastrels not only spent the grain reserves of the Stalin era but also threw the gold reserves of the Stalin era into the Western market to exchange for grain. To cover up for their masters, Stein even racked his brains to add the following lines to Lenin's dialogue: "We have gold, but gold is not something that can be eaten. Give all the gold to Krasin (he was the People's Commissar in charge of foreign trade at the time), let him go buy grain." Lenin did mention gold in a speech in March 1921, saying, "We have gold, but gold cannot be sold because gold is not something that can be eaten." The latter sentence, "Give all the gold to Krasin, let him go buy grain," is completely Stein's fabrication, a life preserver thrown to the Soviet people by Khrushchev, the traitor, in the name of Lenin. Look, Khrushchev squandered the family's assets, and his hired writers even portrayed him as following Lenin's "instructions." It is hard to believe that there is still shame in the world!

Shatrov's play "July 6th" distorts Lenin into a pacifist who opposes revolutionary war. This Lenin is afraid of war, saying, "War means the destruction of the Soviet government," saying, "The Russian people cannot fight anymore and do not want to fight anymore." This is a malicious slander of Lenin. Marxists have never looked at war with a sentimental eye and have never opposed revolutionary war. Lenin said well, "To get rid of this war, one must wage a revolutionary war." Everyone knows that the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary stance on the issues of war and peace is completely in line with Lenin's views; the Soviet revisionist clique has painstakingly distorted Lenin into a pacifist and used this to attack and slander China's people's firm proletarian stance of supporting world revolution, thus exposing their despicable faces of surrendering to American imperialism.

Another evil purpose of distorting Lenin's image is to launch a full-scale attack on Stalin. Using Lenin to attack Stalin is Khrushchev's "great invention." This great traitor shamelessly shouted many times that he launched a full-scale attack on Stalin and the dictatorship of the proletariat, "from the instructions of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, from his testament." This is a big lie. Almost all the poisonous weeds distorting Lenin that appeared after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party have a hidden theme of attacking Stalin. They are good artistic illustrations of Khrushchev's political lies. Kazakevich's "The Blue Notebook" is the most outstanding example.

In "The Blue Notebook," the Lenin has a long speech about "telling the truth to the masses." The Khrushchev clique once boasted that they launched a full-scale attack on Stalin, merely "telling the whole truth." Comparing the two, it is not difficult to find that the book's dialogue about "truth" is a replica of Khrushchev's black words when he attacked Stalin, completely defending Khrushchev's attack on Stalin. No wonder an old acquaintance of Kazakevich, after reading the manuscript of the novel, expressed his "special appreciation for Lenin's words about truth" and said to the author, "You have done a great favor for the party with this novel!" This "party" of course refers to the Khrushchev clique.

In "The Blue Notebook," Kazakevich also designed a silent monologue for Lenin: "In these twenty years, how many people have been lost!" Besides the old Bolsheviks who sacrificed themselves, "the outstanding Plehanov, the genius Martov, the capable Akselrod, the lovely and kind Vera Zasulich" were also "lost." How strange! After these opportunists were removed from the revolutionary ranks, wasn't the Bolshevik Party stronger? How can one talk about "loss"? More viciously, after Kazakevich described Lenin's endless praise for the "virtues" of the traitors, he then "with a high sense of responsibility and extreme seriousness" thought about the shortcomings of some comrades now: one is greedy for power, another is stupid, the third is indecisive, the fourth is frivolous, and so on, and thought about how these shortcomings would develop to a disgusting degree after seizing power.

Here, the "greedy for power" "one person" is obviously a reference to Stalin. Everyone remembers that it was the great traitor Khrushchev who cursed Stalin as a "dictator" and a "tyrant."

The poisonous weeds distorting Lenin's image that appeared after the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party are countless. Distorting Lenin is to betray Lenin. The rampant spread of these shameless slanders of Lenin in the so-called creations on the theme of Lenin is ironclad evidence that the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has betrayed Lenin, betrayed the October Revolution, and betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Ants climbing a paulownia tree boast of a great country, cicadas shaking a tree talk about how easy it is. No matter how the traitors of Lenin laboriously spread rumors and slander and distort and defame Lenin and Leninism, the glorious image of great Lenin and the revolutionary theory of Leninism will forever live in the hearts of the Soviet people, in the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world, and inspire them to fight unremittingly against the new tsars of the Kremlin until final victory. The light of Leninism and the sun of Mao Zedong Thought will ultimately dispel the clouds of revisionism and shine upon the vast land of Lenin's homeland.

    不许苏修叛徒玷污伟大列宁的光辉形象
    反帝反修文学所　范道底
    苏修统治集团背叛了列宁，背叛了马克思列宁主义。但是，苏修集团口口声声自称为列宁的“继承者”，俨然以“列宁主义者”自居。
    列宁早就指出：“马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者，历史的辩证法就是如此。”同样，列宁主义在全世界取得的光辉胜利，也逼得苏修集团竭力把自己装扮成列宁的“拥护者”，并进而假借列宁的名义反对马克思列宁主义。
    修正主义文艺是修正主义政治的附庸。当苏修叛徒集团打着列宁的旗号在苏联大反无产阶级专政、全面复辟资本主义的时候，一大批为修正主义政治效劳的所谓列宁题材的“创作”，便在苏修文坛应运而生。苏修二十大后大批出笼的歪曲伟大列宁形象的毒草，是苏修二十大的产物，也是苏联修正主义政治路线“不可分割的一部分”。
    列宁是无产阶级的革命导师。列宁的一生，是伟大的无产阶级革命家的一生。斯大林曾对列宁的伟大形象作过极为生动的描述。他说：“列宁是为革命而诞生的。……他在革命动荡时代觉得比任何时候都自在、愉快”，列宁“是一个最高典型的领导者，是一只山鹰”。
    但苏修叛徒为了自己的可耻的政治目的，肆无忌惮地歪曲列宁，胡说什么“列宁也是个人”，而且还是一个“最有人性的人”，拚命鼓吹要把列宁“作为一个人”来描写。有个名叫卡扎凯维奇的作家就叫嚷说：“因为我是艺术家，而不是历史学家，所以我的任务，可以仅仅把列宁描写成一个人”。
    那末，请大家来看看，这帮修正主义文人把列宁“描写”成了一个什么样的“人”呢？
    在苏修二十大后炮制的第一部歪曲列宁的电影剧本《最后的一个秋天》中有这样的镜头：列宁向十七岁的护士沙霞大谈自己的“恋爱史”；什么“我坦白告诉你，我那时一见就钟情了”，什么“吃完了第五张油饼时，就爱上了”，什么“没有娜秋莎，我就无法生活”等等。这些无耻的捏造，把列宁糟踏得简直不成样子。
    “列宁也是个人”，因此列宁一定也“象一切人那样会笑、会恨、会悲痛”，一定也会“因犯错误而悲伤”。于是在被苏修捧为“刻划列宁形象的最佳作”的卡扎凯维奇的《蓝色笔记本》中，写到列宁“悲哀伤感”的地方竟达二十处之多。这个出卖灵魂的修正主义文人，处心积虑地把列宁丑化成一个“心头常常涌上一股股悲哀和孤独之感”的感伤主义者。这纯粹是对伟大列宁的亵渎！
    “列宁也是个人”，而那些封建帝王、贵族诗人也无不是“人”。于是大名鼎鼎的鲍戈廷就叫嚷可以“象阿·托尔斯泰写彼得大帝那样地写列宁”，而初出茅庐的阿飞诗人沃兹涅辛斯基更是丧心病狂地胡诌：“可能，那莱蒙托夫……在某一瞬间，也就是列宁。”真是荒唐透顶！
      “列宁也是个人”，于是，苏修反动文人各显神通，大肆渲染列宁的所谓“人道精神”。有的甚至公开伪造历史，编造列宁如何对阶级敌人宽容忍让的神话。卡扎凯维奇的短篇《仇敌》的整个情节，就是描写列宁如何背着人民委员会，想方设法把孟什维克头子马尔托夫放到了国外，使这个革命的“仇敌”逃开了苏联人民对他的正义审判。
    一切都明白了。他们鼓吹的所谓“把列宁描写成一个人”，就是要从根本上歪曲伟大列宁的形象，以适应苏修集团的修正主义政治路线和为巩固其资产阶级专政服务的。
    苏修二十二大收场不久，老右派谢里文斯基的诗剧《人高于自己的命运》出笼了。这个剧本对列宁的歪曲简直使人发指。一个剧中人问列宁“马克思主义究竟是什么呢？”这个列宁回答说：“不是人为了革命，而是革命为了人。”那共产主义又是什么呢？这个列宁竟然说：“对人的爱——就是共产主义。”明眼人一看就知道，这一派胡言乱语，都是从赫鲁晓夫宣传假共产主义的黑话中抄来的。
    史泰因的剧本《暴雨之间》写的是一九二一年春爆发的喀琅施塔得叛乱。关于这次反革命叛乱，列宁是说得清清楚楚的，它是“社会革命党人和国外白卫分子的作品”；而史泰因却把这次叛乱写成是由于严重经济困难而引起的水兵们的自发的叛逆行动，于是剧中的列宁就想到需要立即“在经济政策上来个转变”，立即推行“新经济政策”。
    为什么史泰因要让剧中的列宁鼓吹“在经济政策上来个转变”呢？原因是赫鲁晓夫集团要“在经济政策上来个转变”，把苏联的经济完全纳入资本主义轨道，在苏联全面复辟资本主义。为了给自己的叛徒嘴脸加上一层“列宁主义”的油彩，赫鲁晓夫便在苏修二十二大上无耻地把他的修正主义路线和当年列宁的新经济政策相类比，别有用心地让他的代表们“不妨回想一下，在国内战争结束之后，弗·伊·列宁以其固有的洞察力和勇敢精神，立即要求对政策进行根本修改，把杠杆从战时共产主义体系急剧地转移到新经济政策。”
    苏修集团推行一系列修正主义路线，使苏联社会主义经济遭到了严重的破坏。这批败家子花光了斯大林时期的粮食储备不算，还拿斯大林时期的黄金储备抛到西方市场去换取粮食。史泰因为了给其主子遮丑，竟挖空心思地在列宁的台词中加了这样一段：“金子我们是有的，但金子是不能吃的东西，把黄金统统交给克拉辛（他是当时主管对外贸易的人民委员——引者），让他去买粮食好了。”列宁在一九二一年三月的一次讲话中确实提到过金子，他说：“金子我们是有的，但是金子不能卖，因为金子是不能吃的东西。”而后一句所谓“把黄金统统交给克拉辛，让他去买粮食好了”云云，却完全是史泰因的杜撰，是他假借列宁的名义抛给苏联人民的叛徒赫鲁晓夫的一个救生圈。看，赫鲁晓夫赔光了家底，竟然也被他的御用文人说成是根据列宁的“遗训”，真不知人间尚有羞耻二字！
    沙特洛夫的剧本《七月六日》则把列宁歪曲成一个反对革命战争的和平主义者。这个列宁害怕战争，说什么“战争意味着苏维埃政权的毁灭”，说什么“俄国人民不能再作战，而且也不想再作战。”这是对列宁的恶毒污蔑。马克思主义者从来不用伤感的眼光来看待战争，从来不反对革命战争。列宁说得好，“要摆脱这个战争就得进行革命战争。”谁都知道，中国共产党在关于战争与和平问题上的革命立场，和列宁的观点是完全吻合的；苏修集团煞费苦心地把列宁歪曲成一个和平主义者，并以此影射攻击中国人民支持世界革命的坚定的无产阶级立场，这就恰好暴露了他们投降美帝国主义的可恶嘴脸。
    歪曲列宁形象的另一个罪恶目的是大反斯大林。利用列宁反斯大林，这是赫鲁晓夫的“一大发明”。这个大叛徒曾恬不知耻地一再叫嚷，他大反斯大林，大反无产阶级专政，“是从弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的指示，从他的遗训出发的”。这是个弥天大谎。苏修二十大后出现的大批歪曲列宁的毒草几乎都有一个潜在的反斯大林的主题，它们正好为赫鲁晓夫的那个政治谎言作了艺术的注解，卡扎凯维奇的《蓝色笔记本》就是最突出的例证。
    《蓝色笔记本》中的列宁，有一大段关于应该“告诉群众真相”的议论。赫鲁晓夫之流当年就大言不惭地说过，他们大反斯大林，不过是“说出了全部真相”。两相对照，不难发现，书中关于“真相”的说白，是赫鲁晓夫当年反斯大林的黑话的翻版，完全是为赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林作辩护的。难怪卡扎凯维奇的一个老相识读完了小说清样后，便表示“特别欣赏列宁关于真相的那些话”，并且对作者说，“您用这部小说给党帮了个大忙！”这个“党”当然是指赫鲁晓夫集团。
    在《蓝色笔记本》中，卡扎凯维奇还给列宁设计了一个无声的独白：“在这二十年中损失了多少人呵！”除了牺牲了的老布尔什维克外，还“损失”了“杰出的普列汉诺夫，天才的马尔托夫，干练的阿克雪里罗得，可爱而善良的薇拉·扎苏里奇。”真是奇怪，从革命队伍中清除了这些机会主义分子后，布尔什维克党不是更加强大了吗？“损失”又从何谈起呢？！更恶毒的是，卡扎凯维奇描写的列宁在对叛徒们的“美德”赞不绝口之后，又“怀着高度的责任感和极度认真的态度想到现在一些同志的缺点：一个人贪于权势，另一个性情愚笨，第三个性格迟疑，第四个轻佻浮躁，——还想到在夺取政权之后，这些缺点将会发展到丑恶的程度。”
    这里，“贪于权势”的“一个人”，很明显是影射斯大林。人们都记得，就是大叛徒赫鲁晓夫破口咒骂过斯大林是个“独裁者”，是个“暴君”。
    苏修二十大后出现的歪曲列宁形象的毒草是数以百计的。歪曲列宁就是为了背叛列宁。这些无耻地污蔑列宁的所谓列宁题材创作的泛滥，是苏修统治集团背叛列宁、背叛十月革命、背叛无产阶级专政的铁证。
    蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。不管列宁的叛徒如何心劳日拙地造谣中伤和歪曲丑化列宁和列宁主义，伟大列宁的光辉形象和列宁主义的革命学说永远会活在苏联人民的心中，活在全世界革命人民心中，并鼓舞着他们去和克里姆林宫的新沙皇作坚持不懈的斗争，直到最后胜利。列宁主义的光芒，毛泽东思想的太阳终究会驱散修正主义的乌云，普照列宁故乡的辽阔大地。
