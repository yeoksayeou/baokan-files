In the presence of the great leader Chairman Mao, in the capital of our great motherland Beijing, the combat hero Mai Xiande met with Chairman Mao's good soldier Nian Siyang.

On the afternoon of the 17th, Nian Siyang visited the Naval General Hospital to see Mai Xiande, who had recently come to Beijing to participate in the conference of active representatives studying Chairman Mao's works. Upon hearing that Nian Siyang had arrived, Mai Xiande hurried to the staircase to greet him. The two met, shook hands warmly, and embraced like long-lost family, full of affection. Nian Siyang excitedly shouted, "Learn from comrade Mai Xiande!" Mai Xiande immediately shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Nian Siyang inquired about Mai Xiande's health with concern, and Mai Xiande expressed his gratitude for Nian Siyang's care, repeatedly stating his desire to learn from Nian Siyang. Nian Siyang said, "Your heroic deeds have deeply moved me and given me great help. I am far behind you in studying Chairman Mao's works. I must learn from you." Mai Xiande waved his hand and said, "No, I have not done enough. You have done well, I should learn from you! Study Chairman Mao's books diligently, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

As early as August this year, these two good soldiers of Chairman Mao, separated by thousands of miles, had already formed a deep revolutionary friendship. At that time, Mai Xiande heard from his comrades about Nian Siyang's heroic deeds in rescuing the train carrying Red Guards and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and was deeply moved. He specially asked his comrades to send a copy of the revolutionary treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and a notebook for studying to Nian Siyang, who was then in the hospital recovering from injuries. Nian Siyang received this precious gift from his distant comrade in the south, tears welling up in his eyes, repeatedly expressing his determination to learn from the combat hero Mai Xiande and to follow his example in actively applying Chairman Mao's works, "devoting his heart to the people." From then on, these two good soldiers of Chairman Mao encouraged and supported each other, hoping that one day they could sit together and discuss their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, and praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! On November 17th, their wish finally came true.

A few days ago, Nian Siyang had just undergone surgery. However, seeing Mai Xiande made him particularly excited. They talked about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Nian Siyang said, "We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'fight selfishness and criticize revisionism,' and fight against the enemy of the 'self' in our minds just as we would fight against class enemies, and thoroughly break down 'self' and establish 'public spirit.'" Mai Xiande added, "Yes, we must establish 'public spirit' and Mao Zedong Thought. Not even a bit of 'self' should be allowed!" When they talked about Liu Shaoqi, they immediately became filled with rage, clenched their fists, and shouted in unison, "Use Mao Zedong Thought to decisively fight him down and make him stink for all eternity, so that he will never be able to rise again."

During the meeting, they exchanged gifts. Mai Xiande wrote neatly on the album "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts": "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Presented to comrade Nian Siyang." During the meeting, they repeatedly and spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They sang "The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents' love is not as great as Chairman Mao's love" over and over again. They encouraged each other, expressing their determination to study Chairman Mao's books diligently, follow Chairman Mao's words, recover from their injuries as soon as possible, and return to the battlefield to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    两颗红心向太阳
    ——记麦贤得和年四旺的会见
    在伟大领袖毛主席身边，在伟大祖国首都北京，战斗英雄麦贤得会见了毛主席的好战士年四旺。
    十七日下午，年四旺到海军总医院探望最近来北京参加海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的麦贤得。麦贤得听说年四旺来了，急忙赶到楼梯口去迎接。两人见了面，热烈地握手，象久别重逢的亲人，亲热极了。年四旺兴奋地高呼：“向麦贤得同志学习。”麦贤得立即高呼：“毛主席万岁！”年四旺关切地询问麦贤得的身体情况，麦贤得十分感谢年四旺同志对自己的关心，一再表示要向年四旺学习。年四旺说：“你的英雄事迹使我很感动，给我很大帮助。我学习毛主席著作比你差得远，我一定要好好地向你学习。”麦贤得摆摆手说：“不，我做得不够。你做得好，我要向你学习！努力读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    早在今年八月间，这两个遥隔千里的毛主席的好战士，就结下了深厚的革命友谊。那时，麦贤得从战友那里听到年四旺抢救运载红卫兵小将的列车、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的英雄事迹，十分感动，特地托战友给正在住院养伤的年四旺同志送去了革命宝书《毛主席语录》和学习笔记本。年四旺收到这份从遥远南方的亲密战友那里捎来的珍贵礼物，激动得热泪盈眶，一再表示要向战斗英雄麦贤得学习，要象麦贤得那样活学活用毛主席著作，“掏尽红心为人民”。从此，这两个毛主席的好战士互相关心互相勉励，他们希望有一天能在一起畅谈学习毛主席著作的体会，颂扬伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想！十一月十七日，他们的愿望终于实现了。
    几天前，年四旺刚动了一次手术。但是，见到了麦贤得，他格外兴奋。他们谈起学习毛主席最新指示的体会，年四旺说：“要坚决响应毛主席‘斗私，批修’的伟大号召，对头脑里的‘私’字这个敌人一定要象对待阶级敌人一样狠狠地斗，一定要大破‘私’字、大立‘公’字。”麦贤得接着说：“对，要大立‘公’字，大立毛泽东思想。‘私’字半点也不能要！”谈到中国赫鲁晓夫，他们顿时怒火满腔，紧握拳头，异口同声地高喊：“要用毛泽东思想，坚决把他斗倒斗臭，叫他永世不得翻身。”
    在会见中，他们互相赠送了礼品。麦贤得在《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》的画册上端端正正写着：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！赠给年四旺同志。”在会见中，他们一次又一次情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”一遍又一遍高唱“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”他们互相鼓励，共同表示，要好好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，争取早日养好伤，重返战斗岗位，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。　（新华社）（附图片）
