Zhou Yang, the counter-revolutionary revisionist, is a complete hypocrite. He sometimes puts on a pitiful face, using the pretext of "people's nature" and "human love" to peddle the black goods of bourgeois art. At other times, he reveals his ferocious nature, openly opposing Chairman Mao's instructions and ruthlessly suppressing proletarian art. Using "soft knives" and "maces" alternately, his goal is to serve his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, in his attempt to restore capitalism.

I.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics do not exist in reality."

However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang openly opposes this teaching of Chairman Mao, boldly proposing to replace the clear party principles of proletarian literature with "people's nature." Look, he grits his teeth and shouts: "I do not agree with using terms like 'party principles' and 'party literary principles.'" What does he agree with? In his own words: "The term 'people's nature' can still be used," "with people's nature as the standard."

What "people's nature"! In essence, it is just a rehash of the reactionary bourgeois "human nature" theory; what opposition to "party principles"! In essence, it is just Zhou Yang and his ilk using a "mace" to suppress proletarian art. Zhou Yang and his ilk use this "mace" to strike down good works that strongly embody the party principles of the proletariat into the eighteenth layer of hell; on the contrary, they elevate black art that deviates from the party principles of the proletariat but possesses so-called "people's nature" to the ninth heaven!

According to Zhou Yang and his ilk, anything that can represent the "interests of all the people," shout the "voice of all the people," express the "wishes of all the people," in short, anything that can "satisfy the diverse needs of the broadest masses of the people," is all "good works" with "people's nature." Well, let's take a look at the works that Zhou Yang and his ilk enthusiastically praise as having "people's nature"! The reactionary film *The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty*, does the landlord head Guangxu represent the "interests of all the people"? He represents only the interests of the reactionary feudal ruling class in suppressing the people's revolution; the dog servant Wu Xun in *The Life of Wu Xun*, does he shout out the "voice of all the people" with tears and snot? He shouts out only the desperate "voice" of a dog servant trying to maintain the crumbling feudal dynasty; the "Sea Green Sky" in *The Dismissal of Hai Rui*, does he "plead for the people," expressing the "wishes of all the people"? He expresses only the "wishes" of so-called "clean officials" to "die for the feudal dynasty"; he expresses only the "wishes" of Peng Dehuai and his gang of right-opportunists to oppose the party and socialism. From this, it can be seen that Zhou Yang and his ilk loudly proclaim "people's nature" in order to blur and even cancel the party principles of proletarian art, allowing weeds to grow and demons to dance in the garden of art.

Chairman Mao says: "The literature and art of the proletariat are a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat, just as Lenin said, they are the 'gears and screws' of the entire revolutionary machine."

Zhou Yang and his ilk change the "party nature" of art into "people's nature," which is to change the proletarian party nature of art into bourgeois party nature, to change proletarian art into bourgeois art, to unscrew the "gears and screws" of art from the proletarian "revolutionary machine" and screw them onto the counter-revolutionary machine of the Chinese Khrushchev, to serve his counter-revolutionary restoration.

Vice Commander Lin says: "The pen and the gun, seizing power relies on these two, consolidating power also relies on these two." Zhou Yang stretches out the claws of "people's nature" to disarm us, to make art a tool for their capitalist restoration, how evil his intentions are!

II.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is no love without reason in the world, nor is there hatred without reason." In a class society, opposing classes can never have any "human love."

However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang comes out again to sing the opposite tune. Look, he throws out the "soft knife" of "human love," squeezing out a few fake tears, saying in a warm and affectionate voice: "We oppose 'love for humanity,' but we do not oppose human love. Do we advocate hatred for humanity?"

What a "compassionate" "great philanthropist"! What a philosophy of not advocating "hatred for humanity" and not opposing "human love"!

However, the written lies cannot cover up the living facts of class struggle. Zhou Yang and his gang's so-called "human love" is just a mask to deceive people. They have never shown the slightest "love" to the proletariat and the working people. In the big poisonous weed *Xie Yaohuan*, they fiercely shout to make our socialist ship "capsize" and "sink to the bottom of the sea," what "human love" is this?! In the big poisonous weed *The Peach Blossom Fan*, they reveal their killing intent and shout: "Once again, let the blood bloom red on the fan!" What "human love" is this?! In many of their counter-revolutionary films, dramas, novels, and poems that they have concocted, we can see the sword lights and shadows they brandish towards socialism, and we can hear the whistling sounds of the bullets they shoot towards the proletariat and the working people, what "human love" is this?! Of course, Zhou Yang and his gang's "human love" also have their "special" content. They love the landlord head Guangxu, love the feudal official Hai Rui, love the despicable servant Wu Xun, love the traitorous elements Hou Fangyu, Yang Sisheng, love the shameful traitor Li Xucheng. In short, they are very "loving" towards all ghosts and demons, social dregs, and at the same time, they love their comrades and themselves even more. In 1964, when the workers, peasants, and soldiers rose up with heavy clubs to criticize the lieutenants under the command of the head of the black line of literature and art, Zhou Yang, such as Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Yang Hansheng, Zhou Yang, together with the Chinese Khrushchev, covered up the sky with one hand, staging a farce of false criticism and true protection. In 1965, when the workers, peasants, and soldiers opened fire on Zhou Yang, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, his backer, the big boss Chinese Khrushchev, sent someone to visit Zhou Yang's sickroom, both "visiting" and "comforting," what a "love" it was! Look at the ugly appearances of the two Khrushchevs visiting abroad: the Chinese Khrushchev embracing the reactionary executioner, the Soviet revisionist Khrushchev kissing the head of the American bandit, what a deep affection, what "love" it was!

Looking at the positive and negative aspects, the truth of Zhou Yang and his gang's "human love" is revealed!

What "human love"! It is to make thousands and tens of thousands of Yang Bao-lao and Xi'er lower their fists of resistance to talk "love" with the blood-debt-ridden Huang Shiren, letting them insult at will. This is the shameless plaque hung outside their cannibalistic banquet hall of "righteousness and morality"!

What "human love"! It is to make thousands and tens of thousands of Li Yuhe put down the red lantern of revolution to talk "love" with the beast that eats people, Yaoshan, letting them slaughter at will. This is the mask worn by this group of devils who eat people without spitting out bones!

What "human love"! It is to make hundreds of millions of people in colonies and semi-colonies who are moaning in hunger and coldness throw down the weapons of revolutionary struggle to talk "love" with the fat capitalist bosses of Washington, letting them continue to exploit at will. This is the Buddhist robe they cover on their murderous knives!

In a word, the "human love" that Zhou Yang picked from the rubbish heap of his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, who said that "people are full of mutual help and love," is to allow only ghosts and demons to rebel, not to allow revolutionary people to rebel; to allow only them to "eat" us, not to allow us to overthrow them.

Where in the world is such a good deal!

"The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound mace, the jade sky is cleared of dust for ten thousand miles." We must hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the "mace" of Zhou Yang and his gang that opposes "party principles" and the "soft knife" that advocates "human love," and sweep Zhou Yang and his gang, along with their ultimate backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, into the garbage heap of history!

    周扬的“狼牙棒”与“软刀子”
    解放军某部战士　红天兵
    反革命修正主义分子周扬是一个十足的两面派。他时而装出一副悲天悯人的样子，打着“人民性”、“人类亲爱”的幌子，极力兜售资产阶级文艺的黑货，时而露出凶神恶煞的本相，明目张胆地对抗毛主席的指示，恶狠狠地扼杀无产阶级文艺。“软刀子”与“狼牙棒”交替使用，目的是为他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义效“犬马之劳”。
    一
    毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    然而，反革命修正主义分子周扬，公然反对毛主席的这一教导，明目张胆地提出要用“人民性”代替无产阶级文艺鲜明的党性原则。你瞧，他咬牙切齿地叫嚣：“我不赞成用‘党性原则’，‘党的文学原则’这类名词。”他赞成什么呢？用他的话说：“人民性这个名词还可用”，“以人民性为标准”。
    什么“人民性”！说穿了，不过是反动的资产阶级“人性论”的翻版；什么反对“党性原则”！说穿了，不过是周扬之流扼杀无产阶级文艺的一条“狼牙棒”。周扬之流用这条“狼牙棒”，把强烈体现无产阶级党性原则的好作品一棒打进十八层地狱；相反，把背离无产阶级党性原则，而具有所谓“人民性”的黑文艺捧到九天云上！
    按照周扬之流的说法，能代表“全体人民的利益”，喊出“全体人民的呼声”，表达“全体人民的愿望”的，一句话，能够“满足”“最广大人民”“多种多样的需要”的，统统是具有“人民性”的“好作品”。那么，请看周扬们狂热吹捧的具有“人民性”的作品吧！反动影片《清宫秘史》中的地主头子光绪，他代表的是“全体人民的利益”吗？他代表的，只是反动封建统治阶级镇压人民革命的“利益”；《武训传》中的狗奴才武训，他一把眼泪一把鼻涕喊出的是“全体人民的呼声”吗？他喊出的，只是狗奴才为维护摇摇欲坠的封建王朝而绝望的“呼声”；《海瑞罢官》中的“海青天”，他
  “为民请命”，表达的是“全体人民的愿望”吗？他表达的，只是所谓的“清官”为封建王朝“誓死效忠”的“愿望”；表达的只是彭德怀一伙右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义的“愿望”。由此可见，周扬之流大肆宣扬“人民性”，目的是为了模糊乃至取消无产阶级文艺的党性原则，让文艺园地里毒草丛生，群魔乱舞。
    毛主席说：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”
    周扬之流变文艺的“党性”为“人民性”，就是变文艺的无产阶级党性为资产阶级党性，就是变无产阶级文艺为资产阶级文艺，就是要把文艺这个“齿轮和螺丝钉”从无产阶级“革命机器”上拧下来，拧在中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命机器上，为他的反革命复辟服务。
    林副统帅说：“笔杆子、枪杆子，夺取政权靠这两杆子”，巩固政权也要靠这两杆子。周扬伸出“人民性”的魔爪，就是要缴我们的“械”，使文艺成为他们复辟资本主义的工具，用心何其毒也！
    二
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”在阶级社会中，对立的阶级之间根本不可能有什么“人类亲爱”。
    然而，反革命修正主义分子周扬又跳出来大唱反调。你瞧，他抛出“人类亲爱”的软刀子，挤出几滴假惺惺的泪水，“温情脉脉”地说：“我们反对‘人类之爱’，又不是反对人类亲爱，难道主张人类之恨吗？”
    好一位“悲天悯人”的“大慈善家”！好一套不主张“人类之恨”，不反对“人类亲爱”的哲学！
    但是，墨写的谎言掩盖不住活生生的阶级斗争的事实。周扬一伙所谓的“人类亲爱”不过是一张遮人耳目的画皮，他们对无产阶级和劳动人民是从来不讲半点“亲爱”的。在大毒草《谢瑶环》里，他们恶狠狠地叫嚣要使我们的社会主义大船“覆舟”，“沉于海底”，这是什么“人类亲爱”？！在大毒草《桃花扇》里，他们杀机毕露地狂呼：“再一番鲜血满扇开红花！”这是什么“人类亲爱”？！在他们炮制的许多反革命电影、戏剧、小说、诗歌中，我们都可以看到他们挥向社会主义的刀光剑影，都可以听到他们射向无产阶级和劳动人民的子弹呼啸声，这又是什么“人类亲爱”呢？！
    当然，周扬之流的“人类亲爱”也确有他们的“特殊”内容。他们爱地主头子光绪，爱封建官僚海瑞，爱卑鄙的奴才武训，爱民族败类侯方域、杨四郎，爱可耻的叛徒李秀成。总之，他们对一切牛鬼蛇神、社会渣滓都十分“亲爱”，同时他们更爱他们的同伙和自己。一九六四年当工农兵奋起千钧棒批判文艺黑线总头目周扬麾下的干将夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙的时候，周扬同中国赫鲁晓夫一手遮天，搞了一场假批判、真保护的丑剧。一九六五年工农兵向周扬这个反革命修正主义分子开火时，他的后台大老板中国赫鲁晓夫派人专程前往周扬病室，又是“看望”，又是“安慰”，这是何等的“亲爱”呵！再看两个赫鲁晓夫出国访问的丑态：中国赫鲁晓夫同反动刽子手拥抱，苏修赫鲁晓夫同美国强盗头子接吻，这又是何等的情投意合，何等的“亲爱”呵！
    正反一看，周扬之流的“人类亲爱”真相大白了！
    什么“人类亲爱”！就是要千千万万个杨白劳、喜儿垂下反抗的拳头，去同那伙血债累累的黄世仁们讲“亲爱”，让他们任意侮辱。这就是他们挂在人肉宴厅外的“仁义道德”的无耻匾额！
    什么“人类亲爱”！就是要千千万万个李玉和放下革命的红灯，去同吃人的野兽鸠山们讲“亲爱”，让他们任意宰割。这就是披在这伙吃人不吐骨头的魔鬼身上的画皮！
    什么“人类亲爱”！就是要亿万在饥寒交迫中呻吟的殖民地半殖民地人民，扔下革命斗争的武器，去同华盛顿大腹便便的资本家们讲“亲爱”，让他们继续任意压榨。这就是他们蒙在杀人刀上的佛衣！
    一句话，周扬从他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫的“人类中彼此充满了互相帮助，互相亲爱”的破烂堆里捡来的“人类亲爱”，就是只准牛鬼蛇神翻天，不准革命人民造反；只准他们“吃掉”我们，不准我们打倒他们。
    天下哪有这样的便宜事！
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”我们要高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底摧毁周扬一伙反对“党性原则”的“狼牙棒”和鼓吹“人类亲爱”的“软刀子”，把周扬之流及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫统统扫进历史垃圾堆！
