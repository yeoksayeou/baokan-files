The world has entered a new revolutionary era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In this great era, revolutionary people from all over the world look to the rising red sun in the East, their hearts turning towards the greatest leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. They day and night hope to come to the center of the world revolution today—China, to see the great teacher of the world revolution whom they think of day and night. People, with boundless affection, praise Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They say, the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the world's revolutionary people!

Chairman Mao, you are the lighthouse of the world's people

Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most respects the masses, and most supports the revolutionary actions of the masses. During the 18th anniversary of our country's founding, Chairman Mao in Beijing received many revolutionary friends from the five continents. All things grow with the help of the sun, and rain nourishes the crops. The friends from various countries regard Chairman Mao's reception of them as the greatest honor, the greatest happiness, and the greatest encouragement. They pour out their hearts in different languages, expressing their most sincere and excited feelings:

"Chairman Mao, you are the great savior of mankind!"

"Chairman Mao, you are the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time!"

"Chairman Mao, you are the lighthouse of the world's people!"

"The world's people have you, and thus have the guarantee of victory!"

"Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you in revolution, striving for the liberation of all the people of the world!"

The revolutionary friend from France, the president of the France-China Friendship Association delegation, Elena Machisio, brought the sincere wishes of the French revolutionary people to the great leader Chairman Mao. When she saw Chairman Mao, she was completely immersed in happiness, and suddenly became so excited that she couldn't speak. After the reception, she had a thousand words surging in her heart and immediately wrote a letter to Chairman Mao.

In the letter titled "Words Not Said to Chairman Mao in Time," she wrote: "Dear Chairman Mao, you are the reddest sun in our hearts, you are the beacon that all eyes turn to. Your thought illuminates the path we walk. Now we understand that we must bravely carry out the line you have formulated, and only then can we ultimately achieve victory. We will follow your teachings to carry out our country's revolution. We are prepared for a long struggle and for sacrifice, victorious but not arrogant, defeated but not discouraged. Every time we think of your reception, it will give us boundless strength in our struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and for socialism and communism."

Elena Machisio returned to her country with great ambition and passion. When she left China, she said that Mao Zedong Thought is the precious wealth of the world's people. In this era, if one does not study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot become a true revolutionary. She expressed her determination to do her utmost to promote Mao Zedong Thought, making it deeply rooted in the hearts of the French people.

Mao Zedong Thought will definitely achieve victory worldwide

During the National Day celebrations, revolutionary masses in the capital often saw a group of young people from Africa wearing shiny gold Mao badges and green uniforms, each holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." These young people were members of the youth organization delegation from the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville).

On October 3, Chairman Mao received these young friends from the fighting land of Africa. In this unforgettable moment of happiness, they raised high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The East Is Red." After the reception, they eagerly shared their feelings. They said, we came to China to see Chairman Mao and to learn Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the red sun in the hearts of the world's people has received us, which is a great support and encouragement to all the people of Congo (Brazzaville) and Africa. We will strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought for life. Mao Zedong Thought is the key for the oppressed people of all countries to struggle for liberation, and it illuminates the path for the people of Africa and the world to struggle for liberation.

"We have come to the East, and now the East is red, but the West will definitely be red too, and the whole world will be red. Mao Zedong Thought will definitely achieve victory around the globe!" This is the enthusiastic praise from comrades from the "Land of Eagles," Albania. The comrades from Albania, who are advancing on the road of socialist revolution and carrying out the movement to revolutionize their thinking, longed to see the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time and the closest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao! As soon as they set foot on Chinese soil, they repeatedly expressed their hope to see Chairman Mao. They said, "We really, really want to see Chairman Mao!"

On October 7, Chairman Mao received them. During the reception, many people were so moved that they shed tears. They immediately conveyed this happy news to their comrades back home. Some people wrote long diaries that night, recording this unforgettable moment in their lives. They excitedly said, Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, but also the red sun in the hearts of the Albanian people and the world's people. The president of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association delegation, Le Pedo, wrote a long poem praising Chairman Mao with great enthusiasm. The poem reads: "I, a warrior from Albania, my heart beats by Chairman Mao's side. The great helmsman Chairman Mao takes the helm, the revolutionary ship sails forward against the wind and waves. People shout joyfully, and I also express the revolutionary feelings of the Albanian people with the loudest voice. We shout a thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the helmsman is Chairman Mao

Several anti-imperialist fighters from Latin America, weary from the front lines of armed struggle against the U.S., came to China. They eagerly hoped to see Chairman Mao and urgently requested to learn Mao Zedong Thought. They said, Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual atomic bomb to smash imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teachings and persist in armed struggle. When they saw the great leader Chairman Mao, whom they had longed for day and night, joy and happiness surged in their hearts. A Bolivian friend said, "My long-cherished wish has come true! I will dedicate my life to the revolution." A Latin American friend wrote a poem after returning to his country, expressing his feelings at that time: "Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the oppressed, passed by my side, seeing him, how happy! Chairman Mao is the savior, breaking the chains on the people; Chairman Mao is the red sun, bringing life and happiness; Chairman Mao is the red star, illuminating the path for the oppressed people to advance." Another Latin American friend, Pablo from Colombia, also wrote: "The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the helmsman is Chairman Mao."

"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the helmsman is Chairman Mao." This is the conclusion drawn by revolutionary friends from various countries based on their own practices. Because they have clearly seen that only the path guided by Chairman Mao is the reliable guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries. The moving scenes of foreign friends visiting our country during the National Day celebrations, eagerly seizing every opportunity to learn Mao Zedong Thought, fully demonstrate the boundless faith and worship of the revolutionary people of all countries for Mao Zedong Thought.

The 72-year-old old worker, president of the Luxembourg-China Friendship Association delegation, Anton Frant, visited China for the third time this year. Each visit deeply moved him by the situation in China, which is advancing by leaps and bounds on the socialist road under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. This time, he personally witnessed the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and expressed his resolute support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, we support what imperialism opposes; we oppose what imperialism supports. After seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, he further strengthened his fighting resolve, disregarding his old age and weakness, enthusiastically visiting factories, rural areas, the army, and schools to learn and visit. Wherever he went, he always took the initiative to lead the reading of Chairman Mao's quotations. Someone advised him to rest a bit, but he said, Chairman Mao's books are the books that the world's people seek liberation from, studying Chairman Mao's works is more important than eating and resting. Chairman Mao is the strong pillar of the world revolution and the lighthouse of the world's people. The people of Luxembourg will definitely achieve victory by following the path indicated by Chairman Mao!

Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of the victory of the world revolution

The friends from the Norwegian regional trade union delegation, after arriving in China, often asked each other before each visit, "Have you brought your weapon?" The answer was always, "The weapon cannot be left behind." The weapon they referred to was the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This delegation, while visiting China, passed through Moscow. At the Moscow airport, someone asked them, "Have you brought your weapon?" They replied, "We have!" and immediately took out a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from their pockets. The Soviet revisionists present were dumbfounded. During their visit to China, they always carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them. They said, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is the weapon of the world's revolutionary people and the guarantee of the victory of the world revolution. The world's people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely achieve liberation.

The Uruguayan friend Nunez, after arriving in China, enthusiastically studied Mao Zedong Thought and praised the great helmsman Chairman Mao for pointing out the correct direction for the struggle of the people of all countries. Pointing to the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he excitedly said that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought emitted by this revolutionary little red book has already shone over Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The revolutionaries of Latin America have already understood that the path to their struggle for liberation lies in this red book. As Chairman Mao's teachings become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses, the revolutionary movements of all countries will accelerate their development.

During the visit of the 15th delegation of activists from the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) to China, a wave of studying the "Three Articles" swept through the delegation. The 60-year-old Ota, along with the young people, insisted on studying every day. They said, it is Chairman Mao who gave us these eyes, enabling us to see the future of the world's development and to fight to the end with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. On National Day, the delegation members, to express their love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, specially made a large red banner, on which was written, "Long live the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought!" On the reviewing stand, they faced Tiananmen Gate, looking at Chairman Mao, and sang "The East Is Red" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" over and over again.

Now, many foreign revolutionary friends have returned to their countries and returned to their battle stations. They brought back the great support and encouragement of the great leader Chairman Mao to the revolutionary people of all countries and the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the people of all countries. Many revolutionary friends, before leaving, all expressed with great ambition and determination: to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to follow the great leader Chairman Mao in making revolution, and to let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high all over the world.

    毛主席啊，世界革命人民永远跟着您！
    世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。在这个伟大的时代里，各国革命人民仰望着东方升起的红太阳，心心向着世界人民最伟大的领袖毛主席。他们日夜盼望能来到当今世界革命的中心——中国，能见到他们日思夜想的世界革命的伟大导师。人们怀着无限深情赞颂毛主席，赞颂毛泽东思想。他们说，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是世界革命人民的灵魂！
      毛主席，您是世界人民的灯塔
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，最相信群众，最尊重群众，最支持群众的革命行动。就在我国国庆十八周年期间，毛主席在北京接见了来自五大洲的许多革命朋友。万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮。各国朋友把毛主席对他们的接见，看做是最大的光荣、最大的幸福，是对他们的最大鼓舞。他们用不同的语言热情倾吐心声，表达他们最真挚最激动的感情：
      “毛主席，您是人类的大救星！”
      “毛主席，您是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者！”
      “毛主席啊，您是世界人民的灯塔！”
      “世界人民有了您，就有了胜利的保障！”
      “毛主席呀，我们永远跟着您干革命，争取全世界人民都解放！”
    来自法国的革命朋友——法中友好协会代表团团长埃伦娜·马希西奥，受法国革命者的委托，带来了法国革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席的衷心祝愿。当她见到毛主席时，她整个身心沉浸在幸福之中，顿时激动得说不出话来。接见以后，她千言万语涌上心头，马上写了一封信给毛主席。
    她在这封题为《未来得及向毛主席说的话》的信中写道：“亲爱的毛主席，您是我们心中的最红的红太阳，您是众目注视的明灯。您的思想照亮了我们所走的道路。现在我们懂得了，我们只有勇敢地贯彻执行您所制定的路线，我们才能最后取得胜利。我们将遵循您的教导进行我国的革命。我们作好长期斗争的准备，作好牺牲的准备，胜不骄，败不馁。我们一想到您的接见，就会使我们在反帝、反修和为社会主义和共产主义的斗争中产生无穷的力量。”
    埃伦娜·马希西奥满怀壮志豪情回国去了，她在离开中国的时候说，毛泽东思想是世界人民的宝贵财富，在当今的时代里，如果不活学活用毛泽东思想，就不能成为真正的革命者。她表示，要竭尽全力宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想在法国深入人心。
    毛泽东思想一定在全世界取得胜利
    在国庆期间，首都革命群众常常看到一队胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章、身穿草绿色制服的非洲青年，他们人人捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，走到那里就学到那里。这些青年，就是刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织代表团的朋友们。
    十月三日，毛主席接见了这些来自战斗的非洲的青年朋友。在这难忘的幸福时刻里，他们高高举起《毛主席语录》，热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。接见以后，他们纷纷畅叙感想。他们说，我们来到中国，就是要见毛主席的，就是来学习毛泽东思想的。现在，世界人民心中的红太阳接见了我们，这是对所有刚果（布）人民和非洲人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。我们一定要终生努力学习毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是各国被压迫人民争取解放的钥匙，它照亮了非洲和全世界人民争取解放的道路。
      “我们来到了东方，现在是东方红，但西方也一定会红，全世界一定会红。毛泽东思想一定会在全球得到胜利！”这是来自“山鹰之国”的阿尔巴尼亚同志们的热情赞语。正在开展思想革命化运动、在社会主义革命大道上阔步前进的阿尔巴尼亚同志，多么想见到当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友毛主席呀！一踏上中国的国土，他们就多次提出希望能见到毛主席。他们说：“我们非常非常想见毛主席！”
    十月七日，毛主席接见了他们。接见时，许多人激动地流下了眼泪。他们立即把这幸福的消息告诉给国内的同志们。有的人连夜写下长长的日记，记下这一生难忘的时刻。他们激动地说，毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民心中的红太阳，世界人民心中的红太阳。阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会代表团团长莱·培多热情洋溢地写了一首歌颂毛主席的长诗。这首诗写道：“我，一名阿尔巴尼亚的战士，心儿在毛主席身边跳动。伟大的舵手毛主席来掌舵，革命的航船乘风破浪向前进。人们尽情地高呼，我也用最响亮的声音表达阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命深情。我们千百次地高呼：万岁，毛主席！万岁，无产阶级文化大革命！”
    大海航行靠舵手，舵手就是毛主席
    几位拉丁美洲的反帝战士，风尘仆仆地从反美武装斗争的前线来到中国，他们热望见到毛主席，迫切要求学习毛泽东思想。他们说，毛泽东思想是摧毁帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的精神原子弹。我们将永远记住毛主席的教导，坚持武装斗争。当他们见到了时时刻刻想念的伟大领袖毛主席的时候，喜悦和幸福激荡着他们的心。一位玻利维亚朋友说：“我梦寐以求的愿望实现了！我将永远献身于革命。”一位拉丁美洲朋友回国后，满怀激情地写了一首诗，来表达他当时的心情：“毛主席，被压迫者心中的红太阳，就从我的身边经过，看到他，多么幸福！毛主席是救星，把人民身上的锁链打破；毛主席是红太阳，带来了生命和幸福；毛主席是红星，照亮了被压迫人民前进的道路。”另一位拉丁美洲朋友、哥伦比亚的巴勃罗也写道：“大海航行靠舵手，舵手就是毛主席。”
      “大海航行靠舵手，舵手就是毛主席。”这是各国革命朋友从自己的实践中得出的结论。因为他们已经清楚地看到，只有毛主席指引的道路，才是各国人民革命事业取得胜利的可靠保证。国庆期间来我国访问的外国朋友，如饥似渴地抓紧一切机会学习毛泽东思想的动人情景，充分说明了各国革命人民对毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限崇拜。
    七十二岁的老工人、卢森堡—中国友好协会代表团团长阿通夫·弗兰克，今年是他第三次访问中国。每次访问，他都被中国在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在社会主义道路上突飞猛进的情况所深深激动。这次，他亲眼看到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，他表示坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，帝国主义反对的，我们支持；帝国主义支持的，我们就反对。见到了伟大领袖毛主席，他更增强了战斗的决心，不顾年迈体弱，热情地到工厂、农村、部队、学校去学习访问，他每到一地总是主动领读毛主席语录。有人劝他休息一下，他说，毛主席的书是世界人民求解放的书，学习毛主席著作比吃饭重要，比休息重要。毛主席是世界革命的坚强柱石，是世界人民的灯塔。卢森堡人民走毛主席指引的道路，一定会取得胜利！
    毛泽东思想是世界革命胜利的保证
    挪威地区工会代表团的朋友们来到中国后，每次参观前常常互相问道：“带武器没有？”回答总是：“武器是不能离身的。”他们所说的武器就是红色宝书《毛主席语录》。这个代表团来中国访问路过莫斯科时，在莫斯科机场上有人问他们：“带武器没有？”他们就回答：“带了！”并且马上从口袋里拿出一本《毛主席语录》。在场的苏修分子目瞪口呆。在中国访问期间，他们更是《毛主席语录》不离身。他们说，《毛主席语录》是世界革命人民的武器，世界革命胜利的保证。世界人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就一定能获得解放。
    乌拉圭朋友努涅斯来到中国后热情学习毛泽东思想，称颂伟大的舵手毛主席给世界各国人民的斗争指出正确的方向。他指着红色宝书《毛主席语录》激动地说，这本革命小红书所放射的毛泽东思想的光辉，已普照亚非拉各洲，拉丁美洲的革命者已经懂得，这本红书里就有他们斗争谋解放的道路。随着毛主席的教导在广大人民中日益深入人心，各国革命运动就会加速发展。
    日中友协（正统）总部第十五次活动家代表团在中国访问期间掀起大学“老三篇”的热潮，六十多岁的太田也和青年一样坚持每天学习。他们说，是毛主席给了我们这双眼睛，使我们能看清世界发展的前途，能和帝修反斗争到底。国庆节那天，代表团全体成员为了表示对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的信仰，特意赶制了一个红色的大幅标语，上面写着：“光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！”在观礼台上，他们向着天安门，眼望毛主席一遍遍高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    现在，很多外国革命朋友已经回国去了，回到战斗的岗位去了，他们带回了伟大领袖毛主席对各国革命人民的巨大支持和鼓舞，带回了中国人民对各国人民的深情厚谊。许多革命朋友临行前，都满怀豪情壮志地表示：要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，跟着伟大领袖毛主席闹革命，让毛泽东思想的红旗在全世界高高飘扬。
