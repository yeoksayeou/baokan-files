Title: The British Colonial Empire Accelerates Its Decline as Fiscal and Economic Conditions Deteriorate

	British Prime Minister Wilson announced on the evening of the 18th that the pound would be devalued by 14.3 percent, changing the exchange rate from one pound to 2.8 dollars to one pound to 2.4 dollars. This is the result of the deepening crisis in the capitalist world and the accelerating decline of the British colonial empire, leading to a severe deterioration in Britain's fiscal and economic conditions.

	This is the third time the pound has been devalued in history. The first two occurred in 1931, during a widespread economic crisis in the capitalist world, and in 1949, when Britain's economy was severely damaged by World War II. Each devaluation of the pound has marked a further decline in the political and economic status of the British colonial empire.

	In his announcement of the pound's devaluation, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer also declared measures to tighten domestic credit, including raising the bank discount rate from the current 6.5 percent to 8 percent. He also announced that approximately $3 billion in foreign debt would be borrowed to "replenish" the severely depleted national treasury and support the crisis-ridden pound. The Labour government, in order to further shift the severe fiscal and economic difficulties onto the working people, also announced cuts in domestic consumption and clearly stated that despite the devaluation of the pound leading to price increases, workers' wages would not be raised accordingly. British bourgeois newspapers acknowledged that after the devaluation, the real income of the British working people would be reduced "in any proportion determined by the government."

	One fundamental cause of the pound's devaluation is that as the British imperialist colonial system collapses, Britain's economic situation continues to deteriorate, with annual trade deficits leading to a precarious position for the pound. Statistics show that from 1964 to the end of 1966, Britain's trade deficit amounted to approximately 1.2 billion pounds. Although the Labour government has relied on the United States for loans and has made severe cuts to the domestic working class over the past few years, the situation has not improved. It is estimated that this year and next year, the deficit will continue to grow. In this situation, Britain's gold and foreign exchange reserves are rapidly depleting, and the pound's position in the capitalist world is increasingly precarious. One of the main purposes of the Wilson government's announcement of the pound's devaluation is to use this "poisonous remedy" to stimulate exports, "improve" the international payment situation, and thus "save" the pound's position. However, even the spokesmen and newspapers of British monopoly capital have had to admit that the devaluation of the pound cannot cure Britain's economic ills.

    英殖民帝国加速衰落财政经济急剧恶化
    英国政府宣布英镑贬值
    英国报纸承认英镑贬值不可能医治英国经济的痼疾
    据新华社伦敦十八日电　英国威尔逊政府十八日晚间宣布英镑贬值百分之十四点三，即把英镑对美元的兑换率，由原来的一英镑等于二点八美元降为一英镑等于二点四美元。这是在资本主义世界总危机不断深化、英殖民帝国加速衰落的情况下，英国财政经济急剧恶化的结果。
    这次英镑贬值是历史上的第三次。前两次发生在资本主义世界普遍爆发经济危机的一九三一年，和遭到第二次世界大战严重破坏的英国经济陷于极端困难时期的一九四九年。英镑的每一次贬值，都标志着英殖民帝国的政治和经济地位的进一步衰落。
    英国财政大臣在宣布英镑贬值的声明中，还宣布采取紧缩国内信贷等措施，包括把银行贴现率由目前的百分之六点五进一步提高到百分之八；并且宣布将再借约三十亿美元的外债，来“充实”极度空虚的国库和支撑危机深重的英镑。工党政府为了把严重的财经困难进一步转嫁给劳动人民，还宣布要削减国内消费，并且明白表示，尽管英镑贬值将引起物价上涨，却不可以相应地提高工人工资。英国资产阶级报刊承认，英镑贬值后，英国劳动人民的实际收入“将按照政府决定的任何比例来降低”。
    造成英镑贬值的一个根本原因是，随着英帝国主义殖民体系的瓦解，英国的经济状况江河日下，国际收支连年出现巨额逆差，从而使得英镑地位越来越处于风雨飘摇之中。据统计，从一九六四年到一九六六年底，英国的国际收支赤字累计达约十二亿英镑之多。工党政府几年来虽然一面依靠美国，不断借债，一面竭力向本国劳动人民开刀，但是，情况并没有好转。据估计，今年和明年，这方面的赤字还将继续增长。在这种情况下，英国的黄金外汇储备日益枯竭，英镑在资本主义世界的地位日益垂危。威尔逊政府这次宣布英镑贬值的主要目的之一，就是想用这种“饮鸩止渴”的办法刺激出口，“改善”国际支付状况，从而“解救”英镑的地位。但是，连英国垄断资本的代言人和报刊也不得不承认英镑贬值不可能医治英国经济的痼疾。
