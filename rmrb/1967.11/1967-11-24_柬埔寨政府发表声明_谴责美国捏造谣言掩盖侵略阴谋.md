	Cambodian Government Issues Statement
	Denouncing U.S. Fabrication of Rumors to Cover Up Aggression Plots

	BEIJING, Nov. 21 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on Nov. 21, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement denouncing the U.S. for fabricating rumors in an attempt to cover up its plots to invade Cambodia.

	The statement refuted an article published on Oct. 29 by the U.S. newspaper "Daily News," written by its Saigon-based correspondent Joseph Fried. The article absurdly claimed that the armed forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam were building so-called "military bases" within Cambodian territory.

	The statement pointed out: "Clearly, there are no military bases of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam or the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Cambodian soil. However, U.S. propaganda agencies, disregarding the facts, are desperately trying to justify the failures of the U.S. invading forces in South Vietnam."

	The statement said that since the patriotic armed forces of South Vietnam control the majority of the regions, it is difficult to understand why these forces would seek refuge in Cambodia.

	The statement emphasized: "The Royal Government finally wants to stress that the U.S.'s continued propaganda campaign against Cambodia's neutrality shows that the U.S. is obstinately insisting on its plan to expand its aggression into Cambodia."

    柬埔寨政府发表声明
    谴责美国捏造谣言掩盖侵略阴谋
    新华社金边二十一日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十一日报道，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，谴责美国捏造谣言，妄图掩盖它侵犯柬埔寨的阴谋。
    声明驳斥了美国报纸《每日新闻》今年十月二十九日刊载的驻西贡记者约瑟夫·弗里德的一篇文章，这篇文章荒谬地造谣说越南南方人民解放武装力量在柬埔寨境内修建所谓“军事据点”。
    声明指出：“显然，在柬埔寨领土上，根本不存在越南南方民族解放阵线或越南民主共和国的任何军事基地，然而美国宣传机构却不顾事实而拚命为美国侵略军在南越所遭受的失败辩解。”
    声明说，既然南越爱国武装力量控制了绝大部分地区，那么人们就很难理解南越爱国武装力量为什么要在柬埔寨寻找庇护所。
    声明说，“王国政府最后要强调指出：美国反对柬埔寨的中立的这种继续不断的宣传运动表明，美国顽固坚持把侵略扩大到柬埔寨的计划。”
