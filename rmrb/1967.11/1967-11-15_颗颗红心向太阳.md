	Hearts Ablaze for the Sun
	Let More People Study Chairman Mao's Works

	A Vietnamese youth educator, Ah Yi, obtained a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," treasuring it as a precious gem. He studied it diligently every day. His four close friends, seeing this, were envious and said to him, "We can't read Chinese, can you translate it into Vietnamese so we can also read Chairman Mao's books?"

	Although this teacher understood Chinese, he had never done translation work before. Initially, he was a bit timid, fearing that he might make mistakes and not accurately convey the profound meaning of the original text. However, driven by his friends' eager desire to study Chairman Mao's works, he bravely took on the responsibility of translation. During the translation process, he encountered many difficulties. After a period of hard work, he finally translated the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" into Vietnamese. Later, he also translated Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," into Vietnamese. From then on, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao's works quickly spread throughout his workplace, and many people carefully copied them, reading Chairman Mao's books every day like Ah Yi.

	Centennial Elder Praises Chairman Mao

	In a deep mountain of the Laotian liberated area, there is a Hmong elder over a hundred years old. Upon hearing that two Chinese guests had come, she specially asked her granddaughter to invite them to her home. Seeing the Chinese friends, this white-haired old woman suddenly became younger, and she couldn't help but sing an old folk song in an ancient tune: "Ah! The friendship between the old and new peoples is evergreen! Chairman Mao, the red sun rising over China, illuminates the land of Laos!"

	Chairman Mao is the Hope of the World's People

	Once, several Chinese students returning from a university in Iraq to their dormitory saw an old man hurriedly crossing the road towards them. He immediately asked, "Are you from People's China?" The Chinese students replied, "Yes." The old man immediately smiled and shook hands warmly with the Chinese students, saying, "Greetings to Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is the hope of the world's people!" After saying this, he left. But after walking a short distance, he turned back and repeatedly reminded them, "Be sure to pass on my greetings to Mao Zedong!"

	Forever Hang Chairman Mao's Portrait

	More and more Indian workers, students, and other revolutionary masses yearn to obtain Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's portraits, and Chairman Mao's badges. An electrician obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao from a Chinese friend and immediately excitedly went out to frame it. When the crowd outside the shop saw the portrait of Chairman Mao he was holding, many people rushed over to view it. One of them kindly reminded him, "The government is anti-China. Won't you be in trouble with the police and spies if you hang Chairman Mao's portrait?" The electrician replied confidently, "Why be afraid? Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the world's working class and laboring people today. I must hang Chairman Mao's portrait." He continued, "Chairman Mao points the way for the world's working class and laboring people. Chairman Mao and we workers are forever heart to heart. Why shouldn't I hang Chairman Mao's portrait? I will forever hang Chairman Mao's portrait at home!"

	Thinking of Chairman Mao, One Feels Full of Strength

	One night, a Burmese worker dressed in black clothes, evaded numerous spies, bypassed several sentry posts of the reactionary military police, crawled for miles, crossed barbed wire, risking his life, and finally entered the quarters of the Chinese experts. When the Chinese experts warmly welcomed him into the room, they saw that both of his hands were scratched. He took out a shiny dagger from his chest and said, "Today, I specially sharpened this dagger. If I encounter Ne Win's people on the way, I will fight to the death." He angrily said, "Ne Win is a bad guy. He makes us have nothing to eat and nothing to wear." He said, "Sometimes I feel desperate, but when I think of the world's people's leader, Chairman Mao, I feel full of strength." Then, he placed the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the table on his chest. At this time, the expert and he together studied a passage from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao": "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." The Burmese worker said passionately, "Chairman Mao is right. I will study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' every day. I will follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao and go to revolution!"

    颗颗红心向太阳
    让更多的人学习毛主席著作
    越南青年教育工作者阿义得到一本《毛主席语录》，如获至宝，每天抓紧时间学习。他的四位好朋友看到后都羡慕不已，纷纷对他说：“我们看不懂中文，你能不能译成越文，让我们也能读毛主席的书。”
    这位教师虽然懂中文，但却从来不曾做过翻译工作。开始，他有些胆怯，怕译错了，不能正确地表达出原文的深刻含义。但是他在朋友们迫切要求学习毛主席著作的心情推动下，勇敢地担起了翻译工作的重担。在翻译过程中遇到了不少困难。经过一番艰苦的劳动，他终于把《毛主席语录》译成了越文。后来，他又把毛主席的《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇光辉著作译成了越文。从此，《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作就迅速地传遍了他工作的地方，许多人认真地抄写，象阿义那样天天读毛主席的书。
    百岁老人歌颂毛主席
    在老挝解放区的一座深山里，有位百岁开外的苗族老太太，听说有两位中国客人来到这里，就特地叫她的孙女去把他们请到家里作客。这位白发苍苍的老人见到中国朋友来了，顿时变得年轻了起来，情不自禁地用古老的民歌曲调唱起一首颂歌：“啊！老中人民的友谊啊！万古常青！毛主席啊，中国升起的红太阳，照耀着老挝的大地！”
    毛主席是世界人民的希望
    一次，几个中国留学生从伊拉克一个大学回宿舍，在路上看到一位老人急急忙忙地穿过公路迎面走来，劈头就问：“你们是从人民中国来的吗？”中国学生回答：“是的。”老人立刻笑逐颜开，紧紧地同中国同学握手，并且非常亲切地说：“向毛主席问好！毛主席是世界人民的希望啊！”说完就走了。但刚走不远，他又回过头来再三叮咛：“一定代我向毛泽东问好啊！”
    永远挂毛主席像
    越来越多的印度工人、学生和其他革命群众渴望得到毛主席著作、毛主席像和毛主席像章。一位电工从中国朋友那里得到毛主席像后，立即兴冲冲地上街去配镜框。当他手捧的毛主席像被商店门口的群众发现之后，许多人一涌而上，争相观看毛主席像。其中一个人好心地提醒说：“（印度）政府正在反华，你挂毛主席像，不怕警察特务前来找麻烦吗？”这位电工理直气壮地回答：“怕什么？毛主席是当今全世界工人阶级和劳动人民最伟大的领袖，我就是要挂毛主席的像。”他接着又说：“毛主席为全世界工人阶级、劳动人民指明方向，毛主席和我们工人永远心连心，我为什么不挂毛主席的像呢？我要把毛主席像永远挂在家里！”
    想到毛主席，浑身就有了力量
    一天晚上，一位缅甸工人换上了一身黑衣服，躲过了一个个暗探，绕过了反动军警的一座座岗楼，爬行数里，穿过铁丝网，冒着生命危险，终于进入了中国专家的宿舍。当中国专家亲切地把他迎进屋时，看见他的两只手都爬破了。他从怀里掏出一把寒光闪闪的匕首，说：“我今天特地把这把匕首磨得快快的，要是路上碰见奈温的人抓我，就和他拚了。”他愤怒地说：“奈温是个坏东西。他弄得我们没有吃，没有穿。”他说：“我有时感到绝望，但是一想到世界人民的领袖毛主席，就感到浑身是力量。”接着，他把桌子上的《毛主席语录》放在自己的胸口上。这时专家就和他一起学了一段毛主席语录：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”这位缅甸工人满怀激情地说：“毛主席说得很对。我要每天学《毛主席语录》。我要走毛主席指出的道路，去革命！”（据新华社）
