Editor's Note: In moments of life and death, one's worldview is fully revealed.

Yang Ziyun, a fuel inspection technician from the 3650th Unit, displayed extraordinary bravery during a firefighting operation. He fearlessly used his own body to block the fiery mouth of an oil tank, thereby saving the day. This heroic act fully demonstrates that he is a revolutionary fighter who has established a complete and thorough proletarian worldview.

The boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought is unparalleled. It is the sharpest weapon for transforming people's souls and worldviews. Yang Ziyun and countless other heroes share a common trait: they have all been nurtured by the "Three Articles" (old three articles). Their proletarian worldview, revealed in an instant, is not a result of chance but of their consistent and unyielding study of the "Three Articles," using them to fight against selfishness and establish selflessness. Because the "Three Articles" have deeply rooted in their minds, they can, in the most critical moments, resolutely act according to the proletarian worldview. This is the fundamental reason why a new generation of communists continuously emerges in our ranks.

The fundamental goal of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and achieve the transformation of people's thinking. Let us all learn from Yang Ziyun, constantly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the "Three Articles" as a sharp weapon to fight against selfishness and establish selflessness, and strive to become revolutionary fighters with a complete and thorough proletarian worldview!

The boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured countless selfless communists! Today, with hearts full of excitement, we introduce a selfless and fearless revolutionary fighter, Yang Ziyun, who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Yang Ziyun is a fuel inspection technician in the Wuhan Air Force. During a firefighting operation at an oil depot, he used his body to block the fire, writing a heroic epic of Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the clouds.

Fiery Trials, Redder Hearts

Comrades will never forget November 23, 1966.

On that day, the comrades from the Oil Supply Section received the honorable task of ensuring the readiness of a sister unit and the timely transfer of a batch of aircraft. With fiery enthusiasm, they began the task of transferring oil from the oil bunkers.

Yang Ziyun had been busy all day, and the next day he had new tasks. In the evening, comrades repeatedly urged him to rest, but he refused. He said, "The aircraft needs to be transferred to XX; this is a national matter. How can I rest?" With that, he and Comrade Guo Fengwen entered the dark and narrow No. 5 oil bunker, working diligently.

Just as they were deeply focused on their work, an unexpected event outside the bunker caused the oil vapor to ignite. A loud explosion echoed, and a fireball burst into the sky, quickly turning the entire bunker area into a sea of flames.

At that moment, Yang Ziyun, who was working inside the No. 5 oil bunker, vaguely heard the commotion outside. He turned around and saw the fire had already reached the "X" door of the No. 5 bunker. He shouted loudly, "Fire!"

As soon as the words left his mouth, a flame rushed into the oil tank's manhole (a hole used for maintenance, allowing entry and exit), and a long flame shot out from the tank. Quickly, the manhole glowed red! The steel plates around the manhole glowed red! The asphalt on the tank melted! The manhole became a powerful flame jet. Blocking this flame jet was the key to extinguishing the fire.

The fire threatened the safety of the bunker group! It threatened the safety of class brothers!

Yang Ziyun knew best: if the bunker group exploded, it would affect the readiness training of the sister unit and the timely transfer of the aircraft, causing significant losses to national property and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. What should he do? The fire sealed the bunker door, cutting off his communication with the outside. Guo Fengwen, who was working with him, had been knocked down by the flames and was unconscious. Only Yang Ziyun was left in the No. 5 bunker.

Yang Ziyun stood by the roaring flames. Time did not allow him a moment's hesitation. "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Chairman Mao's great teachings, he had studied a thousand times, ten thousand times, and now they felt especially close, giving him boundless strength. With an overwhelming heroic spirit, he rushed towards the flames! Upon reaching the manhole, he quickly turned around, standing like a wall in the flames, using his buttocks to firmly block the fiery mouth of the tank. Heroic Yang Ziyun used his body to block the fire, cutting off the fire path, stopping the airflow, and preventing the fire from spreading.

What a heart-stopping heroic act!

Look, our Yang Ziyun tightly, tightly blocked the fire mouth. The flames inside the tank and the surrounding inferno pounced on him like wild beasts. His clothes caught fire, his hair caught fire, Yang Ziyun was engulfed in flames. He stood firmly on the ground, using his hands, already burned by the steel plates, to strongly push against the opposite wall of the bunker. He loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He stood like an iron giant in the blazing doorway, unyielding against the twelve-level typhoon or the thousand-jin thunder.

The fire burned fiercer and fiercer.

Yang Ziyun stood calmly and firmly in the flames, his heart filled with immense emotion! He seemed to be listening to the warm teachings of our dearest leader, Chairman Mao: "To strive is to have sacrifices," "We die for the people, and it is a noble death"; he seemed to be reporting his studies of the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," sharing his insights; he also seemed to recall the conversation with his comrades the night before about studying the "Three Articles": "Whatever the people need, I will give. I dedicate everything to Chairman Mao, to the revolution!" It was our most beloved Chairman Mao who was directly commanding Yang Ziyun to fight against the sea of fire! It was the radiant "Three Articles" that gave Yang Ziyun the great wisdom and courage to serve the public...

Gradually, Yang Ziyun's feet became unstable, his hands could no longer support him, and his mind began to fade. But his head was still held high, his eyes fiercely gazing at the fire outside the bunker and the comrades fighting the fire.

The unit quickly arrived, and the nearby commune members also rushed to the scene. They bravely fought against the fire. "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Chairman Mao's great teachings echoed through the night, shaking the earth.

Suddenly, a strong flame blew Yang Ziyun out of the bunker door. People saw a fireball rolling out, and when they realized it was a person on fire, this person stumbled towards the fire mouth but finally fell to the ground...

"Comrade Yang, Comrade Yang!" Guard squad soldier Yu Honglin recognized Yang Ziyun, quickly extinguishing the flames on his body while calling out excitedly.

"Don't worry about me, quickly, go put out the fire!" Yang Ziyun woke up, his mind only on the words "put out the fire."

"Comrade Yang, the fire has been extinguished..." Yu Honglin, seeing his comrade burned so badly, could not continue.

"Little Yu, to strive is to have sacrifices!" Yang Ziyun said, struggling to get up, but his body shook and he fainted again.

After the fire was extinguished, comrades found deep footprints on the ground in front of the manhole of the No. 5 oil tank; on the opposite wall, they found handprints stained with asphalt. These were fearless handprints, heroic footprints. They shone with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, marking a new milestone in the journey of the heroic fighter on the path of Mao Zedong Thought.

Using the "Three Articles" to Fight Selfishness, Growing in the Process

To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, in moments of life and death, Yang Ziyun stood out, fearing no sacrifice, with not a trace of personal gain or selfish thoughts. This noble quality is exactly what Chairman Mao teaches in the radiant "Three Articles," a quality that every revolutionary fighter should strive to possess: "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Yang Ziyun said: "Fighting selfishness is fighting the selfish thoughts in one's mind, using the brilliant thoughts of the 'Three Articles' to fight, filling one's mind with the spirit of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains, making oneself forever loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao."

Yang Ziyun's growth shows us the broad path of using the "Three Articles" to fight selfishness, pointing out the necessary path for a revolutionary fighter's growth.

In the spring of 1960, Yang Ziyun, the eighteen-year-old son of a poor peasant, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the class enemy, entered the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Yang Ziyun will never forget the conversation with the political instructor soon after he enlisted. At that time, he had just joined the air force and dreamed of becoming a pilot to "fight in the sky." However, the organization assigned him to the logistics department for fuel inspection work. Yang Ziyun sincerely told the political instructor about his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his deep hatred for the class enemy. The political instructor understood this soldier's feelings and seriously told him: "Chairman Mao teaches us: Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests."

"Zhang Side is one of our comrades in this army." Yang Ziyun continued.

The political instructor kindly said: "Just knowing how to recite is not enough; more importantly, we must turn 'serving the people' into our actions."

Yang Ziyun's mind became clear, and he solemnly told the political instructor: "I will follow Chairman Mao's teachings!" He happily picked up his backpack and walked towards his new post.

In the spring of 1963, the unit launched a campaign to learn from Comrade Lei Feng, greatly promoting Yang Ziyun's ideological transformation. One day, Yang Ziyun was working in the laboratory when he heard someone say: "If the laboratory is like Yang Ziyun, by the end of the year, it will surely be a solid four-good unit." Hearing this, Yang Ziyun felt warm in his heart. That night, he opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with the fleeting sense of satisfaction. When he read "making a little contribution and feeling proud, liking to boast, fearing that others don't know," he felt that Chairman Mao was criticizing him. He asked himself: Why did Lei Feng think of Chairman Mao when he achieved success, not himself? Comparing Chairman Mao's teachings with Lei Feng's brilliant example, he blushed and criticized himself: This fleeting sense of satisfaction is not a dangerous signal? If it is not exposed and corrected according to the teachings of the "Three Articles," one will go astray. He decided to learn from Lei Feng, striving to study and apply the "Three Articles," deeply fighting against selfishness and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The next day at the meeting, when everyone praised him, he thoroughly exposed his fleeting selfish thoughts. He said: "Having 'self' in one's mind, even if it's just a fleeting thought, is a dangerous signal. If it is not exposed and corrected according to the teachings of the 'Three Articles,' one will go astray."

The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated Yang Ziyun's heart, and the spirit of the "Three Articles" permeated his soul. The unit circulated two stories about Yang Ziyun:

In the spring of 1965, Yang Ziyun and others were loading oil barrels onto a truck. When comrades were loading the barrels, suddenly one slipped to the side, about to roll down. This was a barrel full of waste oil, weighing over 200 kilograms, which would have been disastrous if it had fallen on a comrade! At this critical moment, Yang Ziyun leaped up, forgetting himself, using his shoulder to firmly hold the barrel, saving his comrades. Later, comrades found a deep scar on his shoulder.

In the autumn of 1966, Yang Ziyun and two other comrades were installing a crane neck on the top of an unloading rack. This was a several dozen kilograms heavy "U"-shaped iron pipe. They had one person pulling from above with a rope, one person pushing from below, and Yang Ziyun climbing the ladder in the middle to receive it. Just as they were about to pull it to the top, the rope slipped, and the crane neck fell towards the comrade below! At this moment, Yang Ziyun fearlessly, quickly used his leg to hook the crane neck, preventing an accident. When comrades helped him, his leg was already deeply bruised.

Thus, Yang Ziyun stepped by step towards the ideological peak guided by the "Three Articles," advancing...

Always with a Heart Towards Chairman Mao

In daily life, Yang Ziyun is a pioneer in fighting selfishness with the "Three Articles"; in the fire, Yang Ziyun is a hero in fighting selfishness with the "Three Articles." Now, he is seriously injured and in the hospital. The new environment and new battles have become Yang Ziyun's new battlefield for studying and applying the "Three Articles."

Yang Ziyun's injuries are very severe. The burn area is 61.5%, with 37% being third-degree burns. His life is in danger!

To save this wounded hero, the leadership sent doctors from Beijing and Shanghai. The heroic deeds strongly moved all the hospital staff, who were determined to restore the comrade's health, giving skin for skin, blood for blood.

Three days and three nights passed, suddenly, Yang Ziyun's body trembled slightly, and people involuntarily bent down, calling out in unison:

"Xiao Yang! Xiao Yang!"

Yang Ziyun woke up from his coma, slowly opening his eyes, looking at the unfamiliar environment, his gaze fixed on the portrait of Chairman Mao opposite him. He saw the brightest red sun in his heart, Chairman Mao, and a happy smile appeared on his lips, softly and deeply calling out:

"Chairman Mao!"

Instantly, the silent ward was filled with joy. Comrades wished he could say a few more words! They heard his low voice asking: "The oil depot?"

"It's safe."

"The transferred aircraft?"

"They have arrived in XX."

These few short sentences were his entire thoughts during the three days and three nights of coma; thinking of Chairman Mao was his entire emotion during the three days and three nights of coma!

Later, Yang Ziyun fainted several more times. But whenever he regained consciousness, he would look at Chairman Mao's portrait and recite the "Three Articles." Although it was difficult for him to recite, he did not miss a word or a character. He said with a determined gaze: "As long as I can see Chairman Mao and think of Chairman Mao's teachings, I can overcome any pain!"

After half a year of treatment, Yang Ziyun's health improved, but his legs were still straight as sticks, unable to move. "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Chairman Mao's warm teachings were inspiring him. The great victory of the Cultural Revolution was encouraging him, and he wanted to quickly get his legs moving to return to the battlefield.

One morning, a nurse entered the ward and found Yang Ziyun, contrary to his usual self, sitting on the edge of the bed, using both hands to support the bed frame, trying to stand up. The white bedsheet was soaked with blood, and his legs, with newly formed tender skin, were split open with bloody wounds. The nurse understood what had happened. She carefully cleaned the blood from his legs with alcohol, her heart aching and concerned: "Xiao Yang, you are not ready to get out of bed yet, why did you secretly practice on your own?" Yang Ziyun anxiously said: "Now is the crucial moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. How can I lie down! I want to get up and fight! I want to use my life to defend Chairman Mao!"

From these few short sentences of Yang Ziyun, the nurse saw his sincere heart towards Chairman Mao. Indeed, from the day he was admitted to the hospital, he could not be separated from Chairman Mao for a moment. When his almost paralyzed hand could first hold a pen to write, he neatly wrote eight golden words: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" Although he was in the hospital, his thoughts followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. He listened to the radio, read newspapers, and discussed with the Red Guards about studying Chairman Mao's works and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism...

Yang Ziyun began his arduous practice of walking. The weather in June was very humid. Yang Ziyun took five or six minutes to take each step. Wherever he walked, sweat dripped. This was not just practicing walking; it was fighting against the burns with an iron will, and it was participating in the battle against selfishness with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao! Look at him, full of confidence in victory, taking each step. With each step, he shouted: "One foot down"; with another step, he shouted: "Another foot down, making the Chinese Khrushchev never rise again!"

It was a sunny morning, and the song "East Is Red" was particularly melodious. Yang Ziyun, after more than a month of leg exercises, was ready to try walking out today...

Yang Ziyun wore a new military uniform, holding a bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," not needing anyone's support, not leaning on the wall, walking steadily and strongly. He walked out of the door, looking eastward, facing the rising sun, walking towards the golden path bathed in sunlight...

Although Yang Ziyun was in the hospital, he was very concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is him sharing his insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism with the young revolutionaries who came to visit him in the hospital.

Yang Ziyun, with an overwhelming heroic spirit, rushed towards the flames!

    无私无畏的革命战士杨梓云
    编者按：生死关头，是一个人的世界观大亮相的时刻。
    三六五○部队油料化验技术员杨梓云同志，在一场扑灭大火的战斗中，毫不犹豫地以自己的血肉之躯，死死地堵住了正在喷射着烈焰的油罐火口。这种英勇的行为，充分表现了他是一个树立了“完全”“彻底”的无产阶级世界观的革命战士。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想威力无比，是改造人的灵魂，改造人的世界观的最锐利的武器。杨梓云同志以及其他许许多多英雄战士都有一个共同点，就是他们都是经过“老三篇”的阳光雨露哺育成长的。他们在一瞬间亮出来的无产阶级世界观的崇高境界，并不是什么偶然因素所决定的，而是象杨梓云那样，经常不断地把光芒万丈的“老三篇”，当作斗私篇来学，当作公字篇来学，时时刻刻，在灵魂深处狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字的结果。
    由于“老三篇”在头脑中深深扎根，因而他们在最危急的时刻，就能毅然地以无产阶级世界观来统帅自己的一切。这是一代共产主义新人，在我们队伍中不断涌现的根本原因。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，是用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，实现人的思想革命化。让我们大家都向杨梓云同志学习，不断地活学活用毛主席著作，用“老三篇”这个锐利武器，斗私批修，破私立公，为做一个树立了完全、彻底的无产阶级世界观的革命战士而努力！
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育出千千万万一心为公的共产主义新人！今天，我们以无比激动的心情，向大家介绍一位用毛泽东思想武装起来的无私无畏的革命战士杨梓云。
    杨梓云同志是武汉空军某部油料化验技术员。在一次扑灭油库大火的战斗中，他用自己的身体堵住火口，以顶天立地的英雄行为，谱写了一曲响彻云霄的毛泽东思想的壮丽凯歌。
    烈火炼心心更红
    同志们忘不了一九六六年十一月二十三日。
    那一天，油运科的同志们，接受了保证兄弟部队战备训练和一批飞机转场的光荣任务。同志们带着火一样的热情，开始了油堡的倒罐作业。
    杨梓云同志白天忙了一天，明天还有新任务，晚上，同志们几次劝他回去休息，他怎么也不肯。他说：“飞机要转场到××，这是国家大事啊，我哪能休息！”说着，就和过凤文同志一起钻进了黑洞洞的五号油堡，紧张地工作起来。
    正当他们全神贯注地工作的时候，油堡外面由于一个意外的原因，引起了油蒸气的燃烧。只听“轰”的一声巨响，在半空中爆炸起一团火球，整个油堡区很快形成一片火海。
    这时，在五号油堡里工作的杨梓云同志，隐约听见外面人声呼叫，一回头，只见火已经冲到五号油堡的“八”字门口。他大声地喊道：
    “火！”
    话音刚落，一股火苗窜进了油罐人孔（油罐维修时，人由此孔出入，称人孔），从油罐里立即喷出一道长长的火龙。很快，人孔烧红了！人孔周围的钢板烧红了！油罐上的沥青烧化了！人孔变成了强大的喷火口！堵住这个喷火口，成为扑灭这场大火的关键。
    火，威胁着油堡群的安全！威胁着阶级兄弟的安全！
    杨梓云同志知道得最清楚：如果油堡群爆炸，那将会影响兄弟部队的战备训练和飞机的按期转场，将会给国家财产造成损失，将会给无产阶级文化大革命带来损失。怎么办？烈火封住了油堡门，隔断了他和外面的联系。同他一道工作的过凤文同志，已经被烈火扑倒昏过去。五号油堡里只剩下杨梓云一个人了。
    杨梓云站在火浪翻滚的火口旁。时间不容他有丝毫迟疑。“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。毛主席的伟大教导，他学过一千次，一万次，此刻，他感到格外亲切，给了他无穷无尽的力量。他以压倒一切的英雄气概，迎着烈火扑过去！一到人孔，猛一转身，象一堵墙似地挺立在烈火中，用臀部死死地堵住了正在喷射着烈焰的火口。英雄的杨梓云同志用自己的身体堵住火口，切断火路，断绝空气，阻止火势继续发展。
    这是多么惊心动魄的英雄行为啊！
    看，我们的杨梓云同志紧紧地、紧紧地堵住火口。油罐里的火流气浪，一个劲地要把他推出去；四周的烈火，猛虎恶狼般地向他扑来。他的衣服烧着了，他的头发烧着了，杨梓云同志浑身是火。他双脚牢牢地踩在地上，将一双已经被钢板烫烂的手，使劲地、使劲地撑在人孔对面的油堡壁上，高声朗读着伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他象钢打铁铸的巨人一样，岿然屹立在火光熊熊的门口。十二级台风吹不倒，万钧雷霆掀不翻。
    火，越烧越大，越烧越猛。
    杨梓云同志从容、坚定地屹立在烈火中，心里充满了无比激动的感情！他象是在谛听我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的亲切教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲”，“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”；象是正在讲用《为人民服务》，汇报自己学习这篇光辉著作的体会；又象是回想起大前天晚上同战友交谈学习“老三篇”心得时说的话：“人民需要我什么，我就拿出什么。我把我的一切都交给毛主席，交给革命！”是我们最最敬爱的毛主席，在直接指挥着杨梓云同志同火海搏斗！是光芒万丈的“老三篇”，给了杨梓云同志一心为公的大智大勇……
    渐渐地，杨梓云同志的脚站不稳了，手撑不住了，神智也有些不清了。但他的头却高高地昂着，双目炯炯地注视着油堡外的火海和救火的战友们。
    部队很快赶到了，附近人民公社的社员们也很快赶到了，他们同大火进行着英勇的搏斗。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的伟大教导，响彻夜空，震撼着大地。
    突然，“呼”地一声，强大的火焰把杨梓云同志冲到了油堡门外。人们只见一团火球滚了出来，等到看清是个火人时，这个火人又跌跌撞撞地向着火口冲去，但他终于倒在地上了……
    “杨技术员，杨技术员！”警卫班战士俞鸿林认出是杨梓云同志，一边替他扑灭身上的火苗，一边激动地呼唤着。
    “不要管我，快，快去救火！”杨梓云同志醒来，心里想的只有“救火”两个字。
    “杨技术员，火已经被扑灭了，……”俞鸿林看到自己的战友烧成这样，说不下去了。
    “小俞，要奋斗就会有牺牲！”杨梓云同志说着，一个劲地想挣扎起来，但是身子一抖动，又昏过去了。
    大火被扑灭以后，同志们在五号油罐的人孔前的地面上，发现了杨梓云同志堵人孔时留下的深深的脚印；在人孔对面的墙上，发现了他顶住火浪冲击时留下的沾着沥青的手印。这是无畏的手印，这是英勇的脚印。它放射着毛泽东思想的光芒，标志着英雄战士在毛泽东思想的大道上前进的新的里程。
    用“老三篇”斗私，在斗私中成长
    为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，在生死关头挺身而出，视死如归，没有一丝一缕的个人得失，没有半分半毫的私心杂念。杨梓云同志的这种高贵品质，正是毛主席在光芒万丈的“老三篇”中谆谆教导的、每个革命战士都要努力具备的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的共产主义精神。杨梓云同志说：“斗私，就是斗头脑里的私心杂念，就是用‘老三篇’的光辉思想斗，使自己头脑里装上张思德、白求恩的精神，老愚公的干劲，使自己永远忠于党，忠于毛主席。”
    杨梓云同志的成长，给我们展示出了用“老三篇”斗私的宽广道路，向我们指出了一个革命战士成长的必由之路。
    一九六○年春天，杨梓云，这个刚满十八岁的贫农的儿子，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，走进了人民解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校。
    杨梓云同志永远忘不了入伍不久指导员和他的一次谈话。那时候，他刚到空军，成天想当飞行员“上天”战斗。可是，组织上却决定他到后勤部门搞油料化验工作。杨梓云感情真挚地向指导员述说着自己对毛主席的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的无比仇恨。指导员很理解这个战士的心情，语重心长地告诉他：“毛主席教导我们：我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    “张思德同志就是我们这个队伍中的一个同志。”杨梓云同志接着背下来。
    指导员亲切地说：“光会背还不行啊，更重要的是把‘为人民服务’变成自己的行动。”
    杨梓云心里豁然开朗起来，他对指导员庄严地说：“毛主席说的，我坚决照办！”他愉快地背起背包走向新的工作岗位。
    一九六三年春天，部队掀起了向雷锋同志学习的热潮，大大促进了杨梓云同志的思想革命化。一天，杨梓云同志在化验室工作，听见有人说：“如果化验室都象杨梓云一样，到年底准是硬梆梆的四好。”听了这句话，杨梓云心里觉得热乎乎的。晚上他带着这一闪而过的自满情绪，打开《纪念白求恩》。当他读到“出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道”的时候，就觉得毛主席在批评他。他反问自己：雷锋同志取得成绩时为什么只想到毛主席，不想到自己？想想毛主席的教导，比比雷锋同志的光辉榜样，他红着脸批评自己：这一闪而过的得意心情，不正说明“私”字还顽固地潜藏在自己头脑里，一有机会就抬头吗！他决心象雷锋同志那样，努力活学活用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处大造“私”字的反，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。第二天开会，当大家一个劲地赞扬他时，他却彻底地把昨天一闪而过的私心杂念亮了出来。他说：“头脑里有‘私’字，那怕一闪而过的念头，也是危险的信号，如果不把它亮出来，不按照‘老三篇’的教导彻底改掉，就要走到邪路上去。”
    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了杨梓云同志的心，“老三篇”的精神浸透了他的灵魂。部队里流传着这样两件关于杨梓云的故事：
    一九六五年春天，杨梓云和大家一起装车。当同志们把一个个油桶装上汽车时，猛然间，一个油桶滑到一边，眼看要滚下去。这是一个装满了废油、重二百多公斤的油桶，砸在同志身上怎么得了？就在这千钧一发的时候，杨梓云一跃而上，忘记了自己，用肩膀将油桶死死扛住，使同志们脱了险。事后，同志们发现他肩上刻着一道深深的伤痕。
    一九六六年秋天，杨梓云和另外两个同志往卸油架顶上安装鹤管颈。这是一根几十斤重的“人”字形的铁管。他们一个人在高处用绳子拉，一个人在底下往上面送，杨梓云爬上梯子在中间接。快拉到顶时，不料拉绳没有卡住，鹤管颈向着底下的同志砸下来了！这时，杨梓云奋不顾身，飞快地用腿把鹤管颈钩住，避免了一桩事故。等同志们给他松开时，他的腿已被压了一道很深的印子。
    就是这样，杨梓云同志一步紧接一步地向着“老三篇”所指引的思想高峰努力攀登，前进……
    时时刻刻心向毛主席
    在平时，杨梓云同志是用“老三篇”哺育成长的斗私先锋；在火场，杨梓云同志不愧为用“老三篇”武装起来的斗私英雄。现在，他身受严重烧伤入院了。新的环境，新的战斗，成为杨梓云同志活学活用“老三篇”的新战场。
    杨梓云同志的伤势非常严重。烧伤面积达百分之六十一点五，其中三度烧伤占百分之三十七。他的生命处于危险中！
    为了抢救这位光荣负伤的战士，领导上派来了北京的、上海的医生。英雄的事迹，强烈地感动着医院全体人员，只要能恢复战友的健康，要皮有皮，要血有血。
    三天三夜过去了，突然，杨梓云同志的身子微微抖动了一下，人们情不自禁地伏下身子，同声喊了起来：
    “小杨！小杨！”
    杨梓云从昏迷中醒过来了，他慢慢地睁开了眼睛，看了看这陌生的环境，目光直直地落在对面的毛主席像上。他看见了心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，嘴角上浮起了幸福的微笑，轻轻地、无限深情地喊道：
    “毛主席！”
    刹时间，沉寂的病房出现了欢乐的气氛。同志们多么希望他能再多说几句话啊！只听得他声音低沉地问道：“油库？”
    “保住了。”
    “转场的飞机？”
    “到达××了。”
    短短的几句话，是他三天三夜昏迷中的全部思想；想念毛主席，是他三天三夜昏迷中的全部感情！
    以后，杨梓云同志又好几次昏过去。但只要一清醒过来，他睁眼就看毛主席像，张口就背“老三篇”。尽管他背起来很费劲，却一句不漏，一字不错。他闪着坚毅的目光说：“我只要能看到毛主席，想到毛主席的教导，再大的痛苦也能战胜！”
    经过半年的治疗，杨梓云的健康状况有了一定的好转，但他那两条腿还是直得象木棍一样，动也不能动一下。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的亲切教导在激励着他。文化大革命的伟大胜利在鼓舞着他，他要尽快地让腿动起来，到战斗岗位上去。
    一天早晨，护士一进病房，就发现杨梓云同志一反往常地坐到床沿上，双手扶着床架想站起来。雪白的床单上浸着一滩血，再看他的腿，新生的嫩皮嫩肉，暴裂开一道道的血口。护士明白是怎么回事了。她用酒精小心翼翼地替他洗净腿上的血迹，又是心痛又是关切地说：“小杨，你现在还不到下床的时候，怎么就自个儿偷偷练起来了？”杨梓云着急地说：“现在是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我怎么能躺得下去啊！我要起来参加战斗！我要用生命保卫毛主席！”
    从杨梓云同志这短短的几句话里，护士同志看到了他那颗忠于毛主席的赤诚的心。是啊，从入院那天起，他一时一刻离不开毛主席。当他那几乎失去功能的手，第一次能够拿起笔来写字的时候，端端正正写下的是八个金光闪闪的大字：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”虽然他身在病房，但他的思想却紧紧地跟着毛主席的伟大战略部署在前进。他听广播，看报纸，和红卫兵小将交谈学习毛主席著作、斗私批修的心得体会。……
    杨梓云开始了艰难的练步。六月的天气，闷热得很。杨梓云每迈一步，都得五六分钟。他走到那里，汗水就淌在那里。这不仅仅是练步，是以钢铁般的意志在同烧伤作斗争，这更是以一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心在参加斗私批修的战斗啊！你看他，充满必胜的信心迈出每一步。迈一步，就喊一声：“踏上一只脚”；再迈一步，再喊一声：“再踏上一只脚，叫中国的赫鲁晓夫永世不得翻身！”
    这是一个阳光灿烂的早晨，《东方红》的歌声格外嘹亮。杨梓云同志经过一个多月的练腿，今天要走出去试试了……
    杨梓云同志穿着一身崭新的军装，手里拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不要人搀，不扶墙壁，走得那么稳，那么有力。他走出大门，放眼向东方望去，迎着一轮红日，向着铺满金色阳光的大道走去。……
