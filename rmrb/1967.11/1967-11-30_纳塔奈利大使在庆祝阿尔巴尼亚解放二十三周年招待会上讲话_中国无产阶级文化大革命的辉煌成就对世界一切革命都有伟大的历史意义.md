Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear Comrade Chen Boda, dear Comrade Kang Sheng, dear Comrade Li Fuchun, dear Comrade Jiang Qing, dear Chinese comrades and friends, respected friends, ladies and gentlemen:

Today, the Albanian people are celebrating the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation and the victory of the people's revolution with particular joy. On behalf of my colleagues and in my personal capacity, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to you for attending this reception held in honor of the glorious day of the Albanian people. In the great Chinese cities, our allies, the brotherly Chinese people, revolutionary workers and cadres, heroic soldiers of the liberation army, diligent commune members, and brave Red Guards have once again strongly expressed their high sentiments of combat friendship and internationalist solidarity with the Albanian people. Allow me to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude to the seven hundred million people of revolutionary China, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the Government of the People's Republic of China.

After five years of armed struggle against the Italian and German fascist occupiers, the Albanian people completely liberated their country on November 29, 1944, and drove the enemy beyond their national borders, thus making their contribution to the great anti-fascist war of the enslaved and freedom-loving peoples of the world. In the national liberation war, the landlord and bourgeoisie of our country collaborated with the occupiers and participated in the armed struggle against the people, thus suffering the same fate as the foreign enemies. Under the brave and wise leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (today's Labor Party), led by the founder and leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people overthrew the exploitative feudal-bourgeoisie on November 29, 1944, and seized power into their own hands. Albania embarked on the path of independent development and socialist revolutionary transformation. The entire history of our people, especially the period of the national liberation war from 1939 to 1944 and subsequent events, has proven that the Albanian people regard freedom and independence as the most precious things, and they have always preferred to die standing rather than live kneeling.

Under the consistent, steadfast, and confident leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, after 23 years of heroic and unremitting labor, our people are celebrating their liberation and the victory of the people's revolution in a completely new situation. Semi-feudal, semi-colonial Albania has become a country with a socialist economy. The party's Marxist-Leninist policies have triumphed and continue to advance in industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and the old dark culture and reactionary class ideology have been fundamentally overthrown. Industrial production has increased by more than thirty-nine times compared to pre-war levels. Many important industrial sectors, such as mining, oil, metallurgy, electricity, chemicals, machinery, and textiles, have achieved significant development. Agricultural collectivization has created conditions for utilizing our country's fertile land by expanding cultivated areas and deep plowing. Currently, the cultivated area has increased by more than one and a half times, and the irrigated area has increased by six and a half times. Thousands of tractors and agricultural machinery serve the farmers who used primitive tools before the war. In both urban and rural areas, eight-year compulsory education has been implemented. Today, one-quarter of our population is studying in primary, secondary, and higher schools. The living standards of the people continue to improve. The entire population enjoys free health services. The defensive power of our motherland is invincible. Around our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the people of our country are united like steel. The international prestige of our motherland is higher than ever.

The great achievements made by our people in these 23 years have been achieved in the struggle against the difficulties caused by the backward economy and technology inherited from the past, as well as in the continuous struggle against the sabotage, interference, economic and military blockade, pressure, plots, and blackmail of imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys, the revisionists Khruchev and Tito. Throughout these 23 years, the slogan of our party, "One hand with a gun, one hand with a pickaxe," has been consistently upheld. The attempt by the Soviet revisionist leadership to subjugate the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party has failed miserably due to the revolutionary firmness and vigilance of our party and people, and the unbreakable unity between our party and people.

The revolutionary atmosphere and surging momentum in labor and other aspects of life, especially in recent years, have fully mobilized the laboring masses of our country. Due to these resolutions and other profound ideological measures, phenomena such as bureaucracy, selfishness, careerism, and placing personal interests above collective interests, which generate and develop revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, have been struck with devastating blows. Our party is determined to carry the proletarian revolution to the end in all fields. To make small socialist Albania, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, forever a "great beacon of socialism in Europe," the party pays special attention to the revolution in the fields of thought and culture.

The comprehensive internationalist assistance provided by great People's China to our people is an important factor in our great achievements. Our people will forever be grateful to the brotherly Chinese people, party, Government of the People's Republic of China, and our closest friend Chairman Mao Zedong for this assistance. The great friendship that has withstood severe tests binds the Albanian people and the Chinese people together. It has withstood the impact of stormy waves, and no force, whether imperialist or revisionist, can violate this friendship. It is indestructible because it has been forged by the two Marxist-Leninist parties and the great leaders Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha of the two countries. It serves the highest interests of our two peoples, the interests of socialism and the revolutionary cause, and the unity of the international communist movement, and therefore it will be continuously strengthened. The visit of the Albanian party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu to the friendly ally, the People's Republic of China, played a major role in further strengthening our friendship, cooperation, and unbreakable unity. A year ago, Chairman Mao Zedong's historic telegram to our party's Fifth National Congress was the highest expression of this friendship. In the heart of every Albanian, the immortal words of Chairman Mao Zedong are written in golden letters: "The two countries of China and Albania, though separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades." "Believe, comrades, no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together." Our people, party, and government are proud and happy for this friendship and are determined to safeguard it from any enemy's encroachment and to continuously strengthen it under any circumstances.

Dear comrades and respected friends:

The Albanian people are also celebrating the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation and the victory of the people's revolution with a new great victory, that is, the brilliant historical victory achieved by the brotherly Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the faithful successor of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has overthrown the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road led by China's Khrushchev, and is eliminating their bourgeois and revisionist ideology on Chinese soil. The achievements of this revolution in one and a half years not only have a great historical significance for the fate of China but also for the people of all countries fighting for freedom and independence, for all revolutionary and liberation movements, and for the international communist movement. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized seven hundred million Chinese people to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, which is not only the concretization of Marxism-Leninism under Chinese conditions but also has great theoretical and practical significance for further enriching scientific socialism. The great waves of the Cultural Revolution have exposed and eliminated a batch of disguised counter-revolutionary revisionists and struck a heavy blow to their social base—the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to the positions of conservative forces, careerists, and selfish individuals and has created a large number of daring-to-criticize, daring-to-fight, and daring-to-win red revolutionary teams across the country.

The Cultural Revolution has made people's thoughts unprecedentedly revolutionary and, on this basis, has implemented Chairman Mao's famous slogan "Grasp revolution, promote production." The current situation is excellent. Revolutionary great alliances and three-in-one combinations are being achieved victoriously across the country, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fighting selfishness, criticizing revisionism, and Mao Zedong Thought study classes are pushing the Cultural Revolution to a new and higher stage.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great Chinese people have shown to the world that the banners of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, the October Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution will forever fly high and pure over revolutionary China. The victories in industry, agriculture, defense, and the recent achievements in nuclear weapons explosions, as well as the smashing of counter-revolutionary peaceful evolution in China, have brought infinite joy to the Albanian people and the revolutionary people of the world, and have caused our common enemies—the imperialists and revisionists, Johnson, Brezhnev, and Kosygin—to tremble. For this reason, they have joined forces to oppose People's China, oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and oppose the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong; but the true revolutionaries are increasingly uniting more closely around the great, glorious, and indomitable China and are continuously winning victories. The existence of powerful revolutionary People's China led by the great outstanding Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao Zedong is a decisive factor in defending the revolution and an important factor in the struggle for liberation by the peoples and oppressed nations of all countries. Our great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "We Albanian communists confidently point out that, especially in the current situation, the existence of powerful, revolutionary People's China and the great Chinese Communist Party, led by the outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, which is fighting, steadfast, and loyal to Marxism-Leninism, is a great fortune for the freedom of the peoples of all countries, world peace, the fate of Marxism-Leninism and socialism."

In foreign relations, over the past 23 years, the People's Republic of Albania has consistently pursued a correct, principled foreign policy based on Marxist-Leninist principles, serving to strengthen the independence, sovereignty, and international status of the People's Republic of Albania and the interests of the revolutionary and socialist cause. It fully supports the foreign policy of the Government of the People's Republic of China and firmly believes that Taiwan will definitely be liberated. The People's Republic of Albania condemns the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists for plotting various schemes, with the support of other reactionaries, to politically and militarily encircle China and force it to accept their nuclear monopoly. On all contemporary political issues and issues in the international communist movement, there is complete agreement between the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China, which makes us very happy.

Imperialism and revisionism can never isolate the People's Republic of Albania geographically. She will consistently pursue a policy of good neighborliness and the establishment of normal relations with neighboring countries, and no force can stop her from advancing. Albania on the Adriatic Sea, just as great China on the Pacific Ocean, will forever hold high the red flag of revolution and will forever be a steadfast warrior in supporting the oppressed and freedom-loving peoples of all countries. We are grateful for the unconditional support of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and our closest and greatest friend Chairman Mao Zedong for our foreign policy. We are grateful for the seven hundred million Chinese people's resolute stand on the side of the Albanian people.

Dear comrades and respected friends:

Currently, the development of international events, especially the new upsurge in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, indicates that the balance of power is increasingly favorable to socialism and the liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries. The failure of imperialism and modern revisionism is inevitable. They are openly colluding to conspire against the freedom-loving peoples, attempting to realize the so-called "two superpowers dividing the world." The weakness of U.S. imperialism is now more evident in Vietnam, where the heroic, brotherly Vietnamese people have inflicted heavy losses on the invaders in the south and north. The strategy of people's war has defeated the imperialist global strategy. The victories of the heroic Vietnamese people not only have great significance for defending the north, liberating the south, and achieving national reunification but also have great significance for exposing the inhuman face and rotten essence of U.S. imperialism and the treacherous behavior of the Soviet modern revisionist group. Our people, party, and government firmly support the just struggle of the heroic, brotherly Vietnamese people and firmly believe that their struggle will definitely achieve a thorough and final victory. The imperialist and revisionist peace talks and the savage bombing by U.S. imperialism will never subjugate the heroic Vietnamese people. We are delighted to see that great People's China is giving great, resolute, and unconditional support to the brotherly Vietnamese people. Another new event in the imperialist war policy is the sudden invasion of the imperialists and Israel against the Arab people. The Middle East invasion exposed the conspiracy of the United States and the Soviet Union to collude against the freedom and independence of the Arab people and at the same time showed the world who their true friends are.

The Albanian people and government firmly condemn this act of aggression and will forever support the just cause of the struggle of the brotherly Arab people.

After the Glassboro talks between Johnson and the traitor Kosygin, Soviet-American cooperation has been continuously strengthened, and they are conspiring behind the people's backs to eliminate socialism, extinguish revolutionary wars, and liberation wars of the peoples of all countries, ultimately achieving the goal of the two superpowers ruling the world.

The greatest obstacle to their realization of these conspiracies is the existence of People's China, which is illuminated by the great thoughts of Chairman Mao. People's China, like a giant, has become an indomitable fortress of revolution and socialism in Asia and the world, a standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and a steadfast warrior against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

All the leading Marxist-Leninist parties of the world, the freedom-loving peoples of all countries who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism, racism, and all kinds of oppression and exploitation, the peoples of all countries who are fighting against the ruling revisionist groups, and all the peoples of all countries who are threatened by the aggression and interference of imperialism and modern revisionism are standing with great China. Mao Zedong's China, which is continuously winning victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is an insurmountable fortress against the common enemies of all humanity.

Please allow me to:

Toast to the great, indestructible friendship between the Albanian people and the brotherly Chinese people and the militant Marxist-Leninist unity between our two parties,

To the glorious, great, revolutionary China and her heroic people,

To the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,

To the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, the closest friend of the Albanian people, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao Zedong,

To the health of Comrade Lin Biao,

To the Government of the People's Republic of China and the health of Comrade Zhou Enlai,

To the Albanian Labor Party led by the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha,

To the health of Comrades Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, and Jiang Qing,

To the health of the diplomatic envoys and their spouses attending this banquet,

To the health of all friends attending this banquet,

Cheers!

    纳塔奈利大使在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年招待会上讲话
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成就
    对世界一切革命都有伟大的历史意义亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的陈伯达同志，亲爱的康生同志，亲爱的李富春同志，亲爱的江青同志，亲爱的中国同志们和朋友们，尊敬的朋友们，女士们，先生们：
    今天阿尔巴尼亚人民以格外愉快的心情来庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放和人民革命胜利二十三周年。我谨代表我的同事们，并以我个人的名义，衷心地感谢你们光临这个为阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣日子所举行的招待会。在伟大的中国各地为庆祝这个值得纪念的日子所举行的庆祝活动中，我们的同盟者、兄弟的中国人民，革命的工人和干部、英雄的解放军战士、勤劳的公社社员和英勇的红卫兵，再一次强有力地表达他们对阿尔巴尼亚人民的战斗友谊的崇高感情和国际主义的团结。请允许我借这个机会向革命中国的七亿人民、向以伟大的领袖毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，表达我们的深切的感激。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民经过了五年的反对意大利和德国法西斯占领者的武装斗争以后，在一九四四年十一月二十九日全部地解放了自己的国家并追击敌人于自己祖国的边界以外，从而为受奴役和热爱自由的各国人民的伟大的反法西斯战争作出了自己的贡献。在民族解放战争中，我国的地主资产阶级同占领者勾结在一起，并参加了反对人民的武装斗争，从而他们遭受了和外来敌人同样的失败命运。阿尔巴尼亚人民在以党的创始人和领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党（今天的劳动党）的勇敢而英明的领导下，在一九四四年十一月二十九日打倒了剥削的封建—资产阶级，并把政权掌握在自己的手中。阿尔巴尼亚走上了独立发展和进行社会主义性质的革命改造的道路。我国人民的全部历史、特别是一九三九年至一九四四年民族解放战争的这个历史阶段和往后的许多事件证明了阿尔巴尼亚人民把自由和独立看成是最宝贵的东西，他们始终是宁可站着死，不愿跪着生。
    在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党一贯忠诚的、坚定的、充满信心的领导下，经过了二十三年的英勇和不懈的劳动之后，我国人民今天是在一个完全新的形势下来庆祝自己的解放和人民革命的胜利的。半封建、半殖民地的阿尔巴尼亚变成了一个具有社会主义经济的国家。在工业化和农业合作化方面，党的马克思列宁主义政策取得了胜利并不断地向前发展，旧的黑暗的文化和反动阶级的意识形态从根本上被推翻了。工业产量同战前相比，增加了三十九倍以上。许多重要工业部门，象矿业、石油、冶金、电力、化学、机械和纺织等部门现在都取得了很大的发展。农业的合作化在扩大耕地面积和深耕细作方面为利用我国富饶的土地创造了条件。目前耕地面积增加了一倍多，灌溉面积增加了六倍半。成千辆拖拉机和农业机械为在战前使用原始工具的农民所服务。在城乡，八年制的教育成为义务教育。今天在我国有四分之一的人口在大、中、小学念书。人民的生活水平不断地提高。全国人民免费地享受卫生服务。我们祖国的国防力量是不可战胜的。在以我们敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的周围，我国人民钢铁般地团结在一起。我们祖国的国际威望比任何时候都高。
    我国人民在这二十三年期间所取得的伟大成就，是在同过去遗留下来的落后的经济技术所造成的困难以及在反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其仆从赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义的种种破坏、干涉、经济军事封锁、压力、阴谋和讹诈的不断的斗争中取得的。在这二十三年中始终贯穿着我们党的“一手拿枪、一手拿镐”的口号。苏共修正主义领导集团要使阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党屈服的企图，由于我们党和人民的革命的坚定性和警惕性，由于我们党和人民之间的牢不可破的团结，遭到了可耻的失败。
    在劳动中和在生活的其他各个领域里所掀起的革命气氛和冲天干劲，特别是最近几年以来对党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和党所采取的其他革命化措施的贯彻，把我国的劳动人民群众充分地发动起来了。由于这些决议和其他的具有深刻内容的思想方面的措施，对官僚主义、利己主义、向上爬的思想、把个人利益放在整体利益之上等等这些产生、发展修正主义和复辟资本主义的危害现象给予了摧毁性的打击。我们党有决心把各个领域里的无产阶级革命进行到底，为了使小的社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚象毛泽东主席所说的永远是“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”，党特别重视在思想和文化领域里的革命。
    伟大的人民中国给予我国人民的兄弟般的国际主义的全面援助，是我国人民取得这一伟大成就的一个重要因素。我国人民永远感激兄弟的中国人民、党、中华人民共和国政府和我国人民的最亲密的朋友毛泽东主席给予我们的这种援助。经历了严重考验的伟大友谊把阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民联结在一起，它坚定地经受住了惊涛骇浪的冲击，世界上没有任何力量、不管是帝国主义或是修正主义能够侵犯这一友谊，它是牢不可破的，因为这是由我们两个马克思列宁主义党和两国伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所锤炼起来的，它有利于我们两国人民的最高的利益、有利于社会主义和革命的事业以及国际共产主义运动的团结，因此它将日益不断地得到加强。最近以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团对友好的同盟者中华人民共和国的访问，在进一步加强我们的友谊、合作和牢不可破的团结中，起了重大的作用。一年以前，毛泽东主席给我们党的第五次全国代表大会的历史性的贺电是这一友谊的最高的表现。在每个阿尔巴尼亚人民的心坎里，都用金光闪闪的字眼写下了毛泽东主席的不朽的词句：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”我国人民、党和政府为这一友谊感到幸福和自豪，并决心维护它免受任何敌人的侵害，在任何情况下都要不断地加强它。
    亲爱的同志们和尊敬的朋友们：
    阿尔巴尼亚人民同样以新的伟大的胜利，即兄弟的中国人民在由马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的忠诚的继承者、当代杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席亲自发动、领导的无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的光辉的历史性的胜利，来庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放和人民革命胜利二十三周年。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命打倒了以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在中国的国土上正在清除他们的资产阶级和修正主义思想。在一年半中这场革命所取得的成就，不仅对中国的命运，而且对争取自由和独立的各国人民，对一切革命和解放运动，对国际共产主义运动，都具有非常伟大的历史意义。文化大革命动员了七亿中国人民来学习和掌握毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想不仅是马克思列宁主义在中国条件下的具体化，而且对进一步丰富科学社会主义具有伟大的理论意义和实践意义。文化大革命的巨浪揪出了和消灭了一批伪装的反革命修正主义分子，沉重地打击了他们所依靠的社会基础——地、富、反、坏、右。无产阶级文化大革命极大地打击了守旧势力、向上爬的人、利己主义者的阵地，并在全国各地造成了一批敢于批判、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的无数的红色的革命队伍。
    文化大革命使人们的思想空前地革命化，并在这个基础上贯彻毛泽东主席的有名的口号“抓革命，促生产”。当前的形势是大好的。在全国各地正在胜利地实现革命的大联合和三结合，毛主席的最新指示要斗私，批修和毛泽东思想学习班，把文化大革命推进到一个新的更高的阶段。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的中国人民向全世界表明，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜、十月革命的旗帜和中国革命的旗帜，将永远纯洁地、高高地飘扬在革命中国的上空。在工业、农业、国防方面所取得的胜利和最近在核武器爆炸中再次表现出来的科学成就以及反革命和平演变在中国的被粉碎，使阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界革命人民感到无限的高兴，使我们的共同敌人——帝国主义者和修正主义者，约翰逊、勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流感到恐惧。为此，他们勾结在一起，反对人民中国，反对无产阶级文化大革命和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席；但是，真正的革命者则日益更加紧密地团结在伟大的、光荣的、坚强不屈的中国的周围，并且不断地取得胜利。有伟大的杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的、强大的革命的人民中国的存在，是保卫革命的一个决定性的因素，是各国人民和被压迫民族争取解放的一个重要的因素。我们的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志说：“我们阿尔巴尼亚共产党人满怀信心地指出，特别是在目前的情况下，有强大的、革命的中华人民共和国的存在，有以杰出的领袖毛泽东同志为首的战斗的、坚强的、忠实于马克思列宁主义的伟大的中国共产党的存在，对各国人民的自由、世界和平、马克思列宁主义和社会主义的命运，是极大的幸运”。
    在对外关系方面，二十三年以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一贯奉行建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础之上的，为加强阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的独立、主权和国际地位、为革命和社会主义事业利益服务的正确的原则性的对外政策。她完全支持中华人民共和国政府的对外政策并坚决相信台湾一定要获得解放。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国谴责美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者，背着中华人民共和国，在其他反动派的支持下，为了实现对中国的政治军事包围，为了迫使她接受他们的核垄断所策划的种种阴谋。在当代所有的政治问题和国际共产主义运动中的问题上，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间存在着完全一致的看法，这使我们感到十分高兴。
    帝国主义、修正主义在地理上的包围从来也不能孤立阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。她将一贯地对邻国奉行睦邻政策和建立正常关系的政策，没有任何力量能阻止她向前迈进。阿尔巴尼亚在亚得里亚海边上，正象伟大的中国在太平洋边上一样，将永远高举革命的红旗，永远作支持受压迫、热爱自由的各国人民的坚强战士。我们对中国人民、中国共产党和我国人民最亲密、最伟大的朋友毛泽东主席对我国外交政策毫无保留的支持表示感激，感激七亿中国人民坚决地站在阿尔巴尼亚人民一边。
    亲爱的同志们和尊敬的朋友们：
    目前，国际事件的发展特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲出现的新的高潮表明，力量对比越来越有利于社会主义和各国人民的解放斗争。帝国主义和现代修正主义的失败是不可避免的。他们公开地勾结在一起，共谋反对热爱自由的人民，妄图实现所谓“两大国分割世界”的阴谋。美帝国主义的弱点目前在越南可以看得更清楚，英雄的、兄弟的越南人民在南方和北方使侵略者遭受了很大损失。人民战争的战略战胜了帝国主义的全球战略。英雄的越南人民的这些胜利不仅对于保卫北方、解放南方，实现祖国统一具有伟大的意义，而且对美帝国主义的反人类的嘴脸和腐朽的本质的揭露以及对苏联现代修正主义集团的叛变行为的揭露也有着重大的意义。我国人民、党和政府坚决支持英雄的、兄弟的越南人民的正义斗争，并且深信他们的斗争一定会取得彻底的最后的胜利。帝修的和谈手法和美帝国主义的野蛮轰炸决不能使英雄的越南人民屈服。我们以无限高兴的心情看到伟大的中华人民共和国给予兄弟的越南人民以伟大的、坚决的、毫无保留的支持。帝国主义战争政策的另一个新的事件是帝国主义和以色列突然向阿拉伯人民发动了罪恶的侵略。中东的侵略事件暴露了美国和苏联阴谋勾结在一起反对阿拉伯人民的自由和独立的共同协定，同时向全世界表明谁是他们的真正的朋友。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府坚决谴责这一侵略行为，并永远支持兄弟阿拉伯人民的正义斗争的事业。
    约翰逊和叛徒柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后，苏美合作不断地加强了，他们背着人民正在策划新的阴谋，企图消灭社会主义，扑灭革命战争和各国人民的解放战争，最后达到两大国主宰世界的目的。
    他们实现这些阴谋诡计的最大的障碍是有毛主席的伟大的思想照耀下的人民中国的存在。人民中国象一个巨人一样成为亚洲和全世界革命和社会主义的坚强不屈的堡垒，成为马克思列宁主义的旗手和反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的坚强战士。
    全世界的领导着强大的革命运动的马克思列宁主义党，反对帝国主义、殖民主义、种族主义和各种压迫和剥削的热爱自由的各国人民，反对执政的修正主义集团的各国人民，一切受帝国主义和现代修正主义侵略和干涉威胁的各国人民，都同伟大的中国站在一起。无产阶级文化大革命正在不断取得胜利的毛泽东的中国是全人类的共同敌人的不可逾越的堡垒。
    请允许我：
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民和兄弟的中国人民之间的伟大的牢不可破的友谊和我们两党之间的战斗的马克思列宁主义的团结，
    为光荣的、伟大的、革命的中国和她的英雄的人民，
    为光荣的中国共产党和无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，
    为中国人民伟大的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友、卓越的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的身体健康，
    为林彪同志的健康，
    为中华人民共和国政府，为周恩来同志的健康，
    为以阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，
    为陈伯达同志、康生同志、李富春同志、江青同志的健康，
    为出席这个宴会的外交使节和他们的夫人的健康，
    为所有参加这个宴会的朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
