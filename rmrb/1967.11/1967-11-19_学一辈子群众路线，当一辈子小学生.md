When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was just established, a large number of revolutionary old cadres and new cadres took up "three-in-one combination" leadership positions. Chairman Mao issued new instructions. He kindly taught us, "You must handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates well, and handle the relationship between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be the masses' primary school students. In a certain sense, the smartest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

We found Chairman Mao's instructions particularly heartwarming. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, encouragement, and exhortation for the new and old revolutionary cadres.

To cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is a great strategic thought and deployment of Chairman Mao. Currently, it is a major principle related to the consolidation and development of the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs of the revolution. In the long run, it has profound and far-reaching significance for ensuring that the proletarian dictatorship will never change color and for the healthy growth of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Revolutionary old cadres correctly treating revolutionary new cadres is, in essence, an attitude towards the mass movement, an attitude towards the active elements and their representatives who have emerged in the mass movement, and a major political issue of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If revolutionary old cadres, after joining the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organs, look down on revolutionary new cadres, make things difficult for them or flatter them without principle, and ignore their revolutionary role, they will go back on their tracks and fall into the quagmire of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a severe test and profound education for revolutionary old cadres. In the early stages of the movement, I did not understand the mass movement and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, committing the error of executing the bourgeois reactionary line. I stood on the wrong side, using the wrong attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement. Over the years, my position had grown, and my arrogance had increased, severely alienating me from reality and the masses. When the movement began, I could not stand the fearless revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary youngsters, with fear as my guiding principle, fearing that social order would be disrupted, fearing that work in various units would be disrupted. In reality, I did not trust the masses and did not truly understand the principle that "the masses are the real heroes." With the wrong stance, black and white would be reversed, and right and wrong would be confused. As a result, the spearhead of the struggle was directed at the masses, suppressing the proletarian revolutionary factions, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," and protecting a handful of bad elements.

Just as I was in danger of losing my way and sliding down the wrong path, the "Sixteen Points" drafted and promulgated by our great leader Chairman Mao were issued, and Chairman Mao's wise instructions at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee were conveyed. I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went among the masses. At the Inner Mongolia Normal College, the revolutionary youngsters talked to me for five days straight. They introduced the class struggle situation at the college over the years with deep class feelings, angrily denounced the bourgeois reactionary line, and earnestly encouraged me to join the revolution. They criticized my mistakes bluntly and without reservation, asking after each issue, "Has it touched your soul?" and insisting that I express my attitude towards the issues they raised. They saw my slight progress and enthusiastically encouraged me, and if they saw that I had not yet understood the issues, they continued to criticize me. In these five days, I gradually understood the revolutionary youngsters' wholehearted dedication to the revolution. Their boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, and unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply moved me. Seeing the new generation personally nurtured by Chairman Mao growing up, I felt very happy from the bottom of my heart. At the same time, I began to feel that I was indeed lagging behind. In these five days, I heard things I had never heard before, understood things I had never understood before, learned things I had never learned before, and received education I had never received before. They quoted a lot of Chairman Mao's teachings in their conversations with me, which made me deeply feel that they understood Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution more profoundly than I did. For decades, I had often been the teacher of the masses, but this time I received the deepest education from the masses, which had a profound impact on my soul and made me understand Chairman Mao's teaching that "the masses are the real heroes" more profoundly. I made up my mind to learn from the masses humbly and be willing to be the masses' primary school student.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, the broad masses launched a high tide of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. At this crucial juncture, Chairman Mao issued a great call: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, I resolutely went among the masses and listened to the broad masses' criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line we had executed. Through the masses' education and my own ideological struggle, I deepened my understanding of the seriousness of the mistakes I had made, further made up my mind to break with the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and resolutely stand with the broad revolutionary masses, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. This continuously raised my ideological awareness, promoted my ideological revolutionization, and deepened my class feelings with the masses. This spring, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and his agent in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region stirred up a counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration tide. At this critical moment, I summarized the lessons from the mistakes I had made in the past, resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went among the masses, shared weal and woe with the revolutionary masses, and fought shoulder to shoulder. In this fierce struggle, I learned more profound and richer practical struggle knowledge from the masses, and at the same time, I forged a deep friendship with the masses in the battle of life. From not trusting the masses to trusting the masses, from alienating myself from the masses to not being able to do without the masses, I gradually changed in this heart-rending class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and gradually changed in this extensive and in-depth mass movement. Through more than a year of tempering by fighting side by side with the masses, I deeply felt that without the masses, I would inevitably make mistakes and accomplish nothing.

The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause nurtured by Chairman Mao in class struggle are growing vigorously, and many of them have taken up leadership positions in various levels of revolutionary committees. There is the issue of properly handling the relationship between superiors and subordinates here, and there is also the issue of handling the relationship between cadres and the masses well. Under these circumstances, revolutionary old cadres have new and more important responsibilities. Revolutionary old cadres must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, cooperate well with new cadres, learn from them humbly, and wholeheartedly support and help them. Leading this new force that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the need of the Party's revolutionary cause and the inescapable responsibility of revolutionary old cadres.

In the course of fighting and working with these revolutionary youngsters, I felt that the first thing is to learn from them sincerely and humbly. Learn from their firm stance, clear banner, and vigorous revolutionary style; learn from their daring to charge, daring to do, fearless of difficulties, and revolutionary spirit. Only by learning from them humbly can we see their main and subsidiary aspects, and only then can we strictly demand of them politically and use correct attitudes and effective methods to help them. Revolutionary old cadres can only strictly demand of themselves politically to effectively support and help the growth of revolutionary new cadres according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The best way to make revolutionary new cadres grow rapidly is to tell them the lessons from our mistakes and at the same time boldly let them take on responsibilities and work freely. Revolutionary old cadres should go among the masses with them, learn from the masses, and prevent them from repeating the mistakes we once made of alienating ourselves from the masses.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly encouraged revolutionary old cadres, new cadres, and the broad revolutionary masses. With the deep implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions, the ideological revolutionization of the cadre ranks will be greatly promoted, and cadres and the masses, new cadres and old cadres will be more closely united. In the great struggle to complete the historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will make new and greater contributions.

    学一辈子群众路线，当一辈子小学生
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会常委、原自治区党委书记处书记　权星垣
    当内蒙古自治区革命委员会刚成立，大批革命老干部和革命新干部走上“三结合”领导岗位的时候，毛主席发出了最新指示。他老人家亲切地教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”我们对毛主席的这个教导，感到格外亲切，这是毛主席对革命的新老干部最大的关怀，最大的鼓励，最大的鞭策。
    经常地培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这是毛主席的伟大战略思想和伟大战略部署。从当前来讲，是关系着革命的三结合临时权力机构的巩固和发展的重大原则问题；从长远来讲，对保证无产阶级政权永不变色，对无产阶级革命事业接班人的健康成长，有着极为深远的重大意义。
    革命的老干部正确地对待革命的新干部，实际上是正确对待群众运动的态度问题，是正确对待在群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子和他们的代表人物的问题，是对待毛主席的革命路线的态度的重大政治问题。如果革命的老干部参加三结合的临时权力机构以后，对革命的新干部瞧不起，刁难他们或无原则捧场，忽视他们的革命作用，就会走回头路，就要陷入资产阶级反动路线的泥坑里去。
    无产阶级文化大革命对革命老干部是一场最严峻的考验，也是一场最深刻的教育。我在运动初期，对群众运动很不理解，对毛主席的革命路线很不理解，犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误，站在错误的立场上，用错误的态度对待了革命的群众运动。这些年来，自己“官”做大了，架子也大了，严重地脱离实际，脱离群众。运动开始，对革命小将的那种天不怕、地不怕、神不怕、鬼不怕的革命精神看不惯，怕字当头，怕把社会秩序搞乱，怕把各单位的工作搞乱。实际上是不相信群众，没真正懂得“群众是真正的英雄”的道理。立场错了，就会颠倒黑白，混淆是非。结果是把斗争的矛头指向了群众，打击了无产阶级革命派，把革命群众打成“反革命”，保护了一小撮坏人。
    正在我迷失方向往邪路滑下去的危险时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”发布了，毛主席在八届十一中全会上的英明指示传达了。我遵照毛主席的教导，走到群众中去。在内蒙古师范学院，革命小将一气给我谈了五天，他们满怀阶级深情向我介绍多年来师范学院阶级斗争的情况，愤怒地控诉资产阶级反动路线，殷切地鼓励我起来革命。他们单刀直入地毫不客气地批评了我的错误，谈完一个问题还要问我一句：“触及你的灵魂了没有？”并且还一定要我对他们提出的问题表示态度。他们看到我有一点进步，就热情鼓励，看到我对问题还没有认识，就继续批评。在这五天里，使我逐渐理解了革命小将们一心一意为革命的心情。他们无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线的精神，深深地感动了我。看到毛主席亲手培养的一代新人的成长，我从内心里感到十分高兴。同时，我开始感觉到自己确实是落后了。在这五天里，我听到了过去没有听到过的话，懂得了过去不懂得的道理，学到了过去没有学到的东西，受到了过去没有受到过的教育。他们和我谈话中间，引用了大量的毛主席的教导，这使我深深地感到，他们对毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列指示，比我理解得深刻。几十年来，自己多是当群众的先生，这次受到了群众的最深刻的教育，对自己的灵魂是一次最大的触动，比较深刻地理解了毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”的教导。我下定决心，虚心向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命深入发展，广大群众掀起了批判资产阶级反动路线的高潮。在这个重要的关头，毛主席发出了伟大号召：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”遵照毛主席的这一教导，我坚决深入到群众中去，并听取广大群众对我们所执行的资产阶级反动路线的批判。经过群众的教育，经过自己的思想斗争，我对自己所犯错误的严重性加深了认识，进一步下定了决心，同资产阶级反动路线决裂，坚决回到毛主席的革命路线上来，坚决同广大革命群众站在一起，批判资产阶级反动路线，从而不断地提高了自己的思想认识，也不断地促进了自己的思想革命化，加深了和群众的阶级感情。今年春季，党内最大的走资派及其在内蒙古自治区代理人掀起了一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流。在这个关键时刻，我总结了过去所犯错误的教训，坚决根据毛主席的教导，到群众里面去，与革命群众风雨同舟，患难与共，并肩战斗。在这场激烈的斗争中，我向群众学到了更为深刻更为丰富的实际斗争知识，同时在战斗的生活中，也和群众结下了深厚的友谊。我从不信任群众到信任群众，从脱离群众到离不开群众，是在无产阶级文化大革命这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争中逐渐转变过来的，是在这场广泛深入的群众运动中逐渐转变过来的。经过一年多来和群众滚在一起共同战斗的磨练，使我深深感到，离开了群众，就必然犯错误，就什么事情也办不成。
    毛主席在阶级斗争中培养起来的一代无产阶级革命事业接班人正在茁壮地成长，他们之中有不少人走上了各级革命委员会的领导岗位。这里有很好地解决上下级关系的问题，也有搞好干部和群众关系的问题。在这种情况下，革命的老干部负有新的更为重要的责任。革命的老干部一定要遵照毛主席的教导，同新干部很好地合作，虚心地向他们学习，满腔热忱地支持他们、帮助他们。带好这支无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的新生力量，是党的革命事业的需要，也是革命老干部义不容辞的责任。
    在和这些革命小将共同战斗中，在和他们一起工作中，我体会到，首先是要虚心地诚恳地向他们学习的问题。学习他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，朝气蓬勃的革命风格；学习他们敢冲敢闯，敢做敢为，不畏艰难的革命气魄。只有虚心地向他们学习，看清他们的主流和支流，才能做到在政治上严格要求他们，才能用正确的态度和有效的方法去帮助他们。革命的老干部只有在政治上严格要求自己，才能按照毛主席的教导，有效地支持、帮助革命新干部成长。使革命的新干部迅速成长的最好方法，是把我们自己犯错误的教训告诉他们，同时也要大胆地让他们挑担子，放手让他们工作。革命老干部要同他们一起，经常到群众中去，向群众学习，使他们不要重复我们曾犯过的脱离群众的错误。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了革命的老干部、新干部和广大革命群众。随着毛主席这一指示的深入贯彻执行，必将极大地促进干部队伍的思想革命化，促使干部和群众、新干部和老干部更加紧密团结，在完成无产阶级文化大革命历史任务的伟大斗争中，作出新的更大贡献。
