The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hongqi Coal Mine in Xiahuayuan, Hebei Province, has actively assisted the local proletarian revolutionary factions in implementing the line of "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and in carrying out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." This has led to an unprecedentedly good situation in the mine area, where revolution is booming and production is flourishing. The mine has completed its annual production task four months ahead of schedule, with stable coal quality, improved labor efficiency, and continuously decreasing costs.

With the help of the soldiers, the revolutionary mass organizations in the mine quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Since the beginning of this year, the broad revolutionary workers have consistently adhered to the eight-hour workday system, and have persistently carried out revolution above ground and promoted production below ground. They have never allowed production to be affected by differing viewpoints.

    红旗煤矿完成全年生产任务
    在河北省下花园红旗煤矿执行支左任务的人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，积极帮助当地无产阶级革命派以
  “斗私，批修”为纲，贯彻执行毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使这个矿区出现了一派革命轰轰烈烈、生产热气腾腾的空前大好局面，提前四个月超额完成了全年生产任务。并且做到了原煤质量稳定，劳动效率提高，成本不断下降。
    在指战员们的帮助下，这个矿的革命群众组织很快实现了革命大联合。广大革命职工今年以来始终如一地遵守八小时工作制，坚持井上闹革命、井下促生产，从来没有因观点不同而影响生产。
