The Chinese Communist Party is a great, glorious, and correct party. It is a party created and nurtured by Chairman Mao. It is a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has usurped key positions in the party and the state, colluded with traitors, formed cliques, and under the guise of "red flags," opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He has attempted to achieve his evil goal of seizing the party and the country.

To seize the party, the Chinese Khrushchev first aims to erase the party's class nature, scheming to turn the vanguard of the proletariat, the Chinese Communist Party, into a revisionist party, a bourgeois party, as part of his organizational preparations for restoring capitalism.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he openly raised the black flag of the "Whole People's Party," opposing Chairman Mao's line on party building. He claimed: "The Chinese Communist Party is an organization of the most intelligent and outstanding men and women of the Chinese nation." The Chinese Communist Party is "the most advanced detachment of the Chinese people." Here, he replaced the "vanguard of the proletariat" with the "vanguard of the Chinese nation" and "the Chinese people." Is this just a difference in a few words? No, this is a fundamental alteration of the nature of our party, denying that the Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. This fully exposes the Chinese Khrushchev's thorough betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Marxism-Leninism holds that all parties have class characteristics, and party nature is the concentrated expression of class nature. There has never been a non-class, super-class party, and there has never been a so-called "Whole People's Party" that does not represent the interests of a certain class. The Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of the Chinese working class. However, the Chinese Khrushchev wants to turn the Communist Party into a so-called "national party," a "people's party," which is utterly absurd! Every nation has exploiting and exploited classes. The concept of "people" has different contents in different historical periods and different countries. If, as the Chinese Khrushchev says, the Chinese Communist Party is "the most advanced detachment of the Chinese people," then during the War of Resistance Against Japan, our party was not the vanguard of the proletariat but a party of all classes and strata willing to resist Japan, including the bourgeoisie and enlightened gentry. During the period of socialist construction, our party would become a party of all classes and strata that support and advocate for socialist construction, including the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. In this way, our party would become a club for various classes, wouldn't it?

The Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda is precisely the revival of the old revisionists Bernstein, Kautsky, and their ilk's "People's Party," and it is a replica of the modern revisionist Khrushchev's "Whole People's Party." Marx and Lenin have long since refuted this "Whole People's Party" to the point of leaving it with no shred of dignity. Marx pointed out bluntly: "The 'Whole People's Party' is 'against the proletarian nature.'" Lenin pointed out: "The attempt to include various classes in 'one party' is a characteristic of bourgeois democrats." "Conscious workers will always oppose the idea of any super-class party." The Chinese Khrushchev, who claims to be the "authority on party building" and a "good student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin," is actually a great traitor to Marxism-Leninism and the biggest traitor to the working class.

After liberation, to steer China towards the capitalist road, the Chinese Khrushchev even more brazenly propagated the reactionary theory of the "Whole People's Party." He openly proposed that rich peasants and capitalists could join the party, shamelessly demanding that party members lead in hiring workers and lead in exploitation. He even absurdly said, "The party rules and laws allow individual farming and hiring people, but not exploitation, is dogmatism." This is sheer nonsense!

In the world, which Marxist-Leninist proletarian party's "party rules and laws" allow party members to hire workers and exploit? Only the "party rules and laws" of a bourgeois party allow hiring people and exploitation. Isn't the Chinese Khrushchev blatantly standing on the side of the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists to reform the party? If we follow the Chinese Khrushchev's words, our party would become the party of the rich peasants and the bourgeoisie.

The theoretical basis of the Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda of the "Whole People's Party" is the reactionary theory of the extinction of class struggle. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Khrushchev advocated class reconciliation, attempting to abandon our party's sharp class struggle with the Kuomintang, cancel our party's sharp class struggle with the bourgeoisie, landlords, and rich peasants, and pursue a line of class capitulation. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Khrushchev actively advocated the parliamentary road, even wanting Communist Party members to "serve as officials" in the Kuomintang government, attempting to "dissolve" our party into the Kuomintang and turn it into a tool of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev even more brazenly propagated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, absurdly saying that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended," and "the issue of whether socialism or capitalism will prevail has now been resolved." He actively advocated pulling a group of representatives of the bourgeoisie into the party.

Chairman Mao pointed out that in our country, "the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended." The party is a tool of class struggle. As long as class struggle exists, there will be class parties. The Communist Party is the party of the proletariat. The so-called "Whole People's Party" is actually a genuine bourgeois party.

The "Whole People's Party" and its theoretical basis propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev are purely deceptive lies and poisonous drugs.

The purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda of the "Whole People's Party" is to change the nature of the party. In this way, he can legally pull capitalists, rich peasants, traitors, and so on into the party, place landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters into important departments of the proletarian dictatorship, so that when the time comes, they can collaborate internally and externally to realize his wolfish ambition of restoring capitalism.

Now, the Chinese Khrushchev has been pulled down from his horse by the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen dog, expose him thoroughly in politics, ideology, and theory, and overthrow and disgrace him forever. Let the "Whole People's Party" of the Chinese Khrushchev and the "Whole People's Party" of the Soviet Khrushchev both go to hell!

    中国共产党是无产阶级的先锋队
    ——痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫篡改党的性质、鼓吹“全民党”的谬论
    华北局“红联”　崔剑
    中国共产党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的党，是毛主席亲手缔造和培育的党，是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党。毛主席教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，窃取党和国家的要职，招降纳叛，结党营私，打着“红旗”反红旗，一贯把自己乔装打扮成“党的权威”，“党的化身”，“党的最高领袖”等等，疯狂反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，妄图实现其篡党、篡国的罪恶目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了篡党，首先就要抹煞党的阶级性，阴谋把无产阶级先锋部队的中国共产党，变成修正主义的党、资产阶级的党，作为他复辟资本主义的组织上的准备。
    他在抗日战争时期，就公开打起“全民党”的黑旗，反对毛主席的建党路线。他声称：“中国共产党是中华民族最聪明的最优秀的男女组织起来的。”中国共产党“是中国人民中最先进的部队”。在这里，他把“工人阶级的先锋队”换成了“中华民族”、“中国人民”的先锋队。这难道是几字之差吗？不，这是从根本上篡改了我们党的性质，否定了共产党是无产阶级先进部队。这充分暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的背叛。
    马克思列宁主义认为，一切政党都是具有阶级性的，党性是阶级性的集中表现。从来没有非阶级的、超阶级的政党，从来就不存在不代表一定阶级利益的所谓“全民党”。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队，中国赫鲁晓夫却要把共产党建成所谓“民族的党”，“人民的党”，这真是荒唐之至！每个民族都有剥削阶级和被剥削阶级。人民这个概念，在不同历史时期、不同的国家，有着不同的内容。如果象中国赫鲁晓夫说的：中国共产党“是中国人民中最先进的部队”的话，那么，我们的党在抗日战争时期，就不是工人阶级先锋队了，而是一切愿意抗日的阶级、阶层，其中包括资产阶级和开明绅士的党。在社会主义建设时期，我们的党就成了一切赞成和拥护社会主义建设的阶级、阶层，其中包括小资产阶级和资产阶级的党。这样一来，我们的党岂不是变成了各个阶级的联合俱乐部了吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的这套货色，正是老修正主义者伯恩施坦、考茨基之流所鼓吹的“人民党”的复活，正是现代修正主义者赫鲁晓夫“全民党”的翻版。对于“全民党”这个破烂，马克思、列宁早就把它批驳得体无完肤了。马克思一针见血地指出：“全民党”是“反对无产阶级性质”。列宁指出：“用‘一个政党’包括各个阶级的企图”，是“资产阶级民主派的特点”。“觉悟工人将永远反对一切超阶级政党的思想”。自称为“建党权威”，“马恩列斯的好学生”的中国赫鲁晓夫，实际上是马克思列宁主义的大叛逆，是出卖工人阶级的最大工贼。
    解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫为了把中国引向资本主义道路，就变本加厉地宣扬“全民党”的反动理论。他公开提出富农、资本家可以入党，无耻地要求党员带头雇工、带头剥削。甚至胡说“党规党法上，允许单干，允许雇人，不许剥削是教条主义。”这简直是混账透顶！
    世界上哪一个马克思列宁主义的无产阶级政党的“党规党法”允许党员雇工，允许党员剥削？允许雇人、允许剥削的只能是资产阶级政党的“党规党法”。中国赫鲁晓夫不是明目张胆地站在地主、富农、资本家的立场上来改造党吗？如果照中国赫鲁晓夫所说的去做，我们的党就会变成富农的党，资产阶级的党。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“全民党”的所谓理论基础，就是反动的阶级斗争熄灭论。早在抗日战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫就鼓吹阶级调和，妄图放弃我党同国民党的尖锐的阶级斗争，取消我党同资产阶级、地主、富农的尖锐的阶级斗争，推行一条阶级投降主义的路线。抗日战争胜利以后，中国赫鲁晓夫积极鼓吹议会道路，竟要共产党员到国民党政府里去“做官”，企图把我党“溶解”到国民党里去，变成资产阶级的御用工具。解放以后，特别是在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，中国赫鲁晓夫更大肆宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，胡说什么“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，“社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了。”他积极主张把一批资产阶级代表人物拉到党内来。
    毛主席指出，在我国，“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”党是阶级斗争的工具，只要有阶级斗争存在，就有阶级的政党。共产党就是无产阶级的政党。所谓“全民党”，实际上是不折不扣的资产阶级政党。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“全民党”及其理论基础，纯粹是骗人的鬼话，害人的毒药。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“全民党”的目的，就在于改变党的性质。这样，就可以合法地把资本家、富农、叛徒等统统拉到党里来，把地富反坏，牛鬼蛇神安插到无产阶级专政机构内的重要部门，以便时机一到，里应外合，实现他复辟资本主义的狼子野心。
    现在，中国赫鲁晓夫已经被无产阶级革命派拉下了马。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，把他从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、斗倒、斗臭，叫他永世不得翻身。让中国赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”，和苏联赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”，一齐见鬼去吧！
