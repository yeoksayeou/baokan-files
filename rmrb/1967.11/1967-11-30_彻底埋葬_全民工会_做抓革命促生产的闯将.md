Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the 56th issue of the Shanghai *Workers' Rebel News*. It sharply exposes the counter-revolutionary revisionist essence of China's Khrushchev on the trade union issue. Two short pieces are selected from a set of articles. We hope that the proletarian revolutionary factions on all fronts will fully mobilize the masses, deeply launch a revolutionary criticism, further purge the poison spread by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by China's Khrushchev, in various fields, seize the revolution, promote production and work, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all battlefields.

Today, our newspaper publishes a set of articles criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist trade union line. It makes us see that whether it is the "All-People's Trade Union" or the "Production Trade Union," they are all the revisionist trash that China's Khrushchev madly opposes Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the workers' movement.

For a long time, China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have injected a whole set of fallacies into the trade union organizations of the working class and formulated a series of black programs. What is the history of human society? What is the workers' movement? What is the "core link" of trade union work? What is the true promotion of production? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." "In China, the main form of struggle is war, and the main organizational form is the army. All other things, such as the organization of the masses and the struggle of the masses, etc., are extremely important, are definitely indispensable, definitely cannot be neglected, but are all for the war." "To grasp ideological education is the core link for uniting the whole Party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." "To seize the revolution, promote production."

Chairman Mao's teachings clearly show that our struggle against China's Khrushchev's revisionist trade union line is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. The "All-People's Trade Union" and the "Production Trade Union" are the poisonous fruits on the poisonous vine of this revisionist trade union line.

We, the working class, are the working class with great Mao Zedong Thought. We have always loved Mao Zedong Thought immensely, and we have always hated the class enemies immensely. Whoever supports Mao Zedong Thought, we will be close to them, and whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the death! We will smash the "All-People's Trade Union" and the "Production Trade Union" advocated by China's Khrushchev against Mao Zedong Thought to smithereens!

To do well in socialist production is our duty as the working class. We have always loved socialist labor, loved state property, and resolutely opposed damaging state property. When the counter-revolutionary economic wind of black reaction tried to blow down the socialist economy, it was we, the working class, who stood up and smashed this anti-Mao Zedong Thought, anti-socialist black wind. But we, the working class, engage in production to build socialism and communism, to liberate all mankind. If we follow China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "productionism," we can only take the road of restoring capitalism.

Only by seizing the revolution can we truly promote production. Only workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can consciously use the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat to do well in socialist production. Things like "welfare first" can only undermine the revolutionary fighting spirit of the working class and damage socialist production.

At present, the most important task before us is to follow Chairman Mao's great instructions to fight self and criticize revisionism, to thoroughly break with the "self" in our minds and thoroughly break with the revisionist poison in our minds, and thus to criticize China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically deeply, thoroughly, and completely, so that he can never rise again. In this great criticism, the criticism of the "All-People's Trade Union" and the "Production Trade Union" is also a very important part. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing the poison of money first, welfare first, production first, expert first, and technology first, can we truly establish the proletarian political line and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principles.

We, the working class, must be the vanguard in fighting self and criticizing revisionism, and be the pioneers in seizing the revolution and promoting production, determined to achieve a double harvest in revolution and production. This vanguard is daring to fight to the death with all the ideological forms of the exploiting classes, and this pioneer has the heart of "looking at Tiananmen Square and embracing the world." Let us raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, with practical actions, to welcome the new victories of the Cultural Revolution! Welcome the new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production!

    彻底埋葬“全民工会”  做抓革命促生产的闯将
    《工人造反报》评论员
    编者按：此文原载上海《工人造反报》第五十六期，它一针见血地揭露了中国赫鲁晓夫在工会问题上的反革命修正主义本质。所载一组短文中，选了两篇。希望各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，都要充分发动群众，深入开展革命大批判，进一步肃清以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大一小撮走资派在各个领域中散布的毒素，抓革命、促生产、促工作，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍所有阵地。
    今天，本报发表了一组批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义工运路线的文章。使我们看到，“全民工会”也好，“生产工会”也好，都是中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席关于工人运动光辉思想的修正主义臭货色。
    中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，长期以来对工人阶级的工会组织灌输了一整套臭谬论，制定了一大堆黑纲领。什么“人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史”，什么“生产运动就是工人运动”，什么“以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育三位一体”，什么“以生活促生产”等等。这些臭货色概括起来，其实就是五毒挂帅：钞票挂帅，福利挂帅，生产挂帅，专家挂帅，技术挂帅。五毒挂帅就是不要无产阶级政治挂帅。就是要把我们工人阶级的工会组织，变为一个不要社会主义革命，不要阶级斗争，单纯地为生产而生产的工会；搞成一个跟资本主义，修正主义一样的工会。
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史”。什么是真正的人类社会发展史？毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“生产运动就是工人运动”。什么是真正的工人运动？毛主席教导我们：“在中国，主要的斗争形式是战争，而主要的组织形式是军队。其他一切，例如民众的组织和民众的斗争等等，都是非常重要的，都是一定不可少，一定不可忽视，但都是为着战争的。”
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育三位一体”。什么是真正的工会工作的“中心环节”？毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“以生活促生产”。什么才是真正的促生产？毛主席教导我们：要“抓革命，促生产”。
    毛主席的教导清楚地表明，我们同中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义工运路线的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。“全民工会”，“生产工会”就是这条修正主义工运路线毒藤上的毒瓜。
    我们工人阶级是具有伟大的毛泽东思想的工人阶级。我们历来无限热爱毛泽东思想，我们历来对阶级敌人无比憎恨。谁拥护毛泽东思想我们就跟他亲，谁反对毛泽东思想我们就是要跟他拚！对于中国赫鲁晓夫反毛泽东思想的“全民工会”，“生产工会”就是要砸它个稀巴烂！
    搞好社会主义生产，是我们工人阶级的职责。我们从来都是热爱社会主义劳动，热爱国家财产，坚决反对损害国家财产。当反革命经济主义黑风妄想吹垮社会主义经济时，正是我们工人阶级挺身而出，粉碎了这股反毛泽东思想、反社会主义的黑风。但是我们工人阶级搞生产，是为了建设社会主义、共产主义，是为了全人类的解放事业。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“唯生产论”搞下去，只能是走上复辟资本主义的道路。
    只有抓革命，才能真正促生产。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，才能自觉地用无产阶级的革命精神去搞好社会主义生产。什么“福利挂帅”之类，都只能瓦解工人阶级革命斗志，使社会主义生产受到破坏。
    当前，摆在我们面前的最重要任务，就是要按照毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，同自己头脑中的“私”字彻底决裂，同自己头脑中的修正主义流毒彻底决裂，从而把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上，批深、批透、批倒、批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。在这个革命的大批判中，对“全民工会”，“生产工会”的批判，也是一个十分重要的内容。只有彻底批臭钞票挂帅，福利挂帅，生产挂帅，专家挂帅，技术挂帅，才能真正树立起无产阶级政治挂帅，毛泽东思想挂帅。
    我们工人阶级要做“斗私，批修”的尖兵，要当“抓革命，促生产”的闯将，誓夺革命、生产双丰收。这个尖兵是敢于同一切剥削阶级意识形态拚刺刀的尖兵，这个闯将是具有“眼望天安门，胸怀全世界”心胸的闯将。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以实际行动，迎接文化大革命的新胜利！迎接抓革命、促生产的新高潮！
