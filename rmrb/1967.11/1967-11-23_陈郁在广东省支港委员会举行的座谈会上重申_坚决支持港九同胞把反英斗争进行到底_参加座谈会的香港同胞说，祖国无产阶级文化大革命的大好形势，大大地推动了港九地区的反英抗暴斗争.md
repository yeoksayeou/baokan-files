Chen Yu, at a symposium held by the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong, reiterated that we firmly support Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots in continuing the anti-British struggle to the end. Hong Kong compatriots participating in the symposium said that the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland has greatly promoted the anti-British and anti-violence struggle in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

	New China News Agency, Guangzhou, November 22nd - The Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong recently held a symposium in Guangzhou, inviting workers from Hong Kong and Kowloon who are on the front lines of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle, as well as some patriotic industrial and commercial figures from Hong Kong and Kowloon participating in the 1967 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair. Chen Yu, the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong, reiterated at the meeting: The people of Guangdong Province, together with the people of the entire country, are determined to be the strong backing of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots and resolutely support Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots in continuing the anti-British and anti-violence struggle to the end.

	Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong, Yan Fusheng and Huang Ye; Deputy Chairman of the 1967 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair, Jia Shi; and relevant department heads attended the symposium.

	Workers from Hong Kong and Kowloon who are on the front lines of the anti-British and anti-violence struggle, and patriotic industrial and commercial figures, with hearts full of admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They detailed the heroic deeds of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots who, to defend the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, maintain the dignity of the motherland, and uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, displayed a fearless revolutionary spirit, and fought the British imperialists to the point of utter confusion and disarray. The patriots pointed out at the symposium: Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots in their anti-British and anti-violence struggle. In this struggle, they have upheld the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shown indomitable spirit, fearlessly confronted violence, and fought the Hong Kong British authorities head-on, achieving one victory after another. They also pointed out that the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland have greatly promoted the anti-British and anti-violence struggle in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

	The patriots participating in the symposium also mentioned that the Hong Kong British fascist authorities have arrested thousands of patriots, from the old to the young, from men to women, but they have not surrendered. Some young students in Hong Kong schools, which are deeply controlled by the Hong Kong British authorities, have risen up to fight under the inspiration of the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and have also started to fight against the Hong Kong British authorities. They pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities are still struggling desperately, enacting many fascist "laws" to intensify the suppression of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The more they persecute the revolutionary people, the more they will promote a broader and more intense revolution." The Hong Kong British authorities are increasingly finding it difficult to cope with the brave struggle of our Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots and are becoming more and more disarrayed.

	Chen Yu spoke at the symposium, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities in brutally suppressing our Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots, and highly praising the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots for upholding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launching a magnificent anti-British and anti-violence struggle. He praised the glorious tradition of the Hong Kong and Kowloon working class for being at the forefront of the anti-violence struggle. Chen Yu said, this great anti-British and anti-violence struggle is a continuation of the anti-imperialist struggle of our people over the past hundred years. Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition will never allow imperialism to run rampant on our land. Chen Yu emphasized that victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, learn from, apply, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, advance bravely, and victory will surely be ours.

	The symposium was filled with passionate sentiments, fully demonstrating the determination of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots to continue the anti-British and anti-violence struggle to the end. After the symposium, the Guangdong Provincial Committee for Supporting Hong Kong and the China Export Commodities Fair jointly held a movie evening to entertain the Hong Kong and Kowloon workers and patriotic industrial and commercial figures participating in the symposium.

    陈郁在广东省支港委员会举行的座谈会上重申
    坚决支持港九同胞把反英斗争进行到底
    参加座谈会的香港同胞说，祖国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大大地推动了港九地区的反英抗暴斗争
    新华社广州二十二日电　广东省支港委员会邀集来自反英抗暴斗争前线的港九职工和部分参加一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会的港九爱国工商界人士，最近在广州举行座谈会，广东省支港委员会主任委员陈郁在会上重申：广东省人民和全国人民一道，誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾，坚定不移地支持港九爱国同胞将反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    广东省支港委员会副主任委员晏福生、黄业，一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会副主任委员贾石，以及有关部门负责人出席了座谈会。
    来自反英抗暴斗争前线的港九职工和爱国工商界人士，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限敬仰的心情，一再高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们以亲身的斗争经历，详细介绍了港九爱国同胞为了捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，维护祖国的尊严，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬大无畏的革命造反精神，把港英帝国主义打得焦头烂额、狼狈不堪的英勇壮举。爱国同胞们在座谈会上指出：毛泽东思想是港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争力量的源泉。他们在反英抗暴斗争中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，表现了英勇顽强的精神，不畏强暴，与港英当局进行了针锋相对的斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。他们还指出，祖国的无产阶级文化大革命，不断取得胜利的大好形势，更大大地推动了港九地区的反英抗暴斗争。
    参加座谈会的爱国同胞还谈到，港英法西斯当局先后逮捕了爱国同胞数千人，从老到少，从男到女，他们都没有屈服。香港一些被港英当局统治较深的学校中的青年学生，在祖国无产阶级文化大革命胜利的鼓舞下，以毛泽东思想为指导，也已经起来斗争，大造港英当局的反。他们指出，港英当局，还在作垂死的挣扎，制订了许多法西斯“法令”，对港九爱国同胞加紧镇压。但是，正如毛主席所指出的：“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”港英当局在我港九爱国同胞的英勇斗争面前，已经越来越难于招架，越来越狼狈不堪了。
    陈郁在座谈会上讲话，强烈谴责港英法西斯当局血腥镇压我港九爱国同胞的滔天罪行，高度赞扬港九爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起波澜壮阔的反英抗暴斗争。赞扬具有光荣传统的港九工人阶级走在抗暴斗争的最前列。陈郁说，这场伟大的反英抗暴斗争，是我国人民近百年来反帝斗争的继续，具有反帝光荣传统的港九爱国同胞，绝不容许帝国主义在我们土地上横行霸道。陈郁强调说，取得反帝、反修斗争胜利靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习、运用、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    座谈会上，群情激昂，充分显示了港九爱国同胞誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底的决心。座谈会后，广东省支港委员会和中国出口商品交易会联合举行电影晚会，招待参加座谈会的港九职工和爱国工商界人士。
