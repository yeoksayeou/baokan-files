Once, an Afghan youth saw a Chinese student holding a book he had long desired: "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He eagerly requested that the Chinese student give it to him as a precious gift. However, this Chinese student only had one copy, and after a moment's hesitation, he did not immediately fulfill the youth's wish. The youth misunderstood and, both anxious and earnest, said: "Oh, please rest assured! I will definitely overcome all difficulties and strive to study Chairman Mao's works."

    努力学习毛主席著作
    一次，一位阿富汗青年看到中国留学生手里拿着一本他梦寐以求的宝书《毛主席语录》。于是，他热切地要求这个中国学生作为珍贵礼物送给他。谁知这个中国学生就只有这么一本，他犹豫了一下，没有立即满足那位青年的愿望。那位青年误会了，因此既着急又恳切地说：噢，请你放心吧！我一定克服一切困难，努力学习毛主席著作。
