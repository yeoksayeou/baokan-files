The Dominican People's Movement recently issued a statement expressing its "unwavering support for the Chinese Cultural Revolution" and highly praising the great significance and revolutionary influence of this great revolution.

The statement said: "The excellent results of the Chinese Cultural Revolution" will enhance the "spiritual and material strength of the oppressed peoples of the world."

The statement said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is the center of the new tide of the world proletariat, "this tide has become a great revolutionary transformation, shaking the imperialist foundations in various parts of the world."

The statement said: "Since the start of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary tide in China and abroad has surged even higher." The statement emphasized that the "influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is reaching the working masses of the Dominican Republic." In the Dominican Republic, this revolutionary tide has arrived through the in-depth study of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other works of Chairman Mao.

The statement said: "Our people have great respect for Chairman Mao. The revolutionary people of the Dominican Republic are studying the works of Chairman Mao Zedong with increasing enthusiasm." The statement pointed out that the revolutionary workers, peasants, and students in the Dominican Republic often discuss Chairman Mao's teachings on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "no investigation, no right to speak," "divide into two parts," and so on.

The statement then discussed the tasks of the Dominican People's Movement in the current political situation in the Dominican Republic, saying that the Dominican People's Movement is "planning to organize and lead the people in a revolutionary struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys in our country, taking armed struggle as the only way out, and taking the countryside as the main stage of this struggle." The statement said that the Dominican People's Movement "takes strengthening political work among the peasants and sending outstanding party members to the countryside as the central task." It also pointed out that it is necessary to fight against Soviet revisionism.

The statement stressed the importance of the ideological front in opposing revisionism and the struggle of revolutionaries against the "self" in their minds. It pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought should be used as a weapon to oppose all kinds of enemies. It said: "While we are opposing the enemy, we must also struggle against ourselves. If we do not fight against selfishness and individualism every day, it will be impossible to establish the leadership of proletarian ideology among us, and our battlefield will be surrounded and occupied by non-proletarian ideology."

The statement said that one should use Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and other works to examine oneself every day. "One of the great teachings of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is that we must carry out ideological revolutionization at all levels of the party, which is an indispensable guideline for all our organizational life. Therefore, we should become students who practice the above three articles."

The statement concluded: "Our party is already prepared to take the most concentrated expression of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—as a guide to continue leading us and the exploited people of our country. This is the only way to liberate the people of our country from the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys."

    多米尼加人民运动坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命
    以毛泽东思想为指针进行武装革命争取解放
    革命者应该天天用毛主席的“老三篇”等著作对照自己促进思想革命化
    新华社二十四日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加人民运动最近发表声明，表示“坚定不移地支持中国无产阶级文化大革命”，并高度赞扬这一大革命的伟大意义和它的革命影响。
    声明说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的优异成果”，将增强世界被压迫人民的“精神力量和物质力量”。
    声明说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是世界无产阶级新潮流的中心，“这股潮流已经变成了革命的大变革，在世界各地动摇了帝国主义的泥沙的基础”。
    声明说：“自从中国文化大革命开展以来，中国国内外的革命高潮更加高涨。”声明着重指出，中国“无产阶级文化大革命的影响正在到达（多米尼加）劳动群众中间”。在多米尼加，这个革命热潮是通过深入学习《毛主席语录》和毛主席的其他著作而来到的。
    声明说：“我国人民对毛主席十分崇敬。多米尼加革命人民以越来越高的热情学习毛泽东主席的著作。”声明指出，多米尼加革命的工人、农民和学生经常谈到毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”、“没有调查就没有发言权”、一分为二等等教导。
    这项声明接着谈到多米尼加人民运动在当前多米尼加政治形势中的任务说，多米尼加人民运动正在“计划组织、领导人民进行反对美帝国主义及其在我国的走狗的革命斗争，把武装斗争作为唯一出路，并且把农村作为这一斗争的主要舞台”。声明说，多米尼加人民运动“把加强农民中的政治工作，派优秀党员到农村去，作为中心任务”。它还指出，必须同苏联修正主义进行斗争。
    声明强调思想战线上反对修正主义以及革命者向自己头脑中私字作斗争的重要性。它指出，应该以毛泽东思想为武器，反对形形色色的敌人。它说：“我们在反对敌人的同时也必须同自己作斗争，如果不每天和私字、个人主义作斗争，就不可能在我们中间建立无产阶级思想的领导权”，“我们斗争的阵地就会被非无产阶级思想包围和占领”。
    声明说，应该每天用毛主席的“老三篇”等著作对照自己。“中国无产阶级文化大革命给我们伟大的教导之一，就是必须在各级党员中进行思想革命化，这是我党一切组织生活必不可少的纲领。因此我们应该成为把上述三篇文章付诸实践的小学生。”
    声明最后说：“我党已经作好了准备，把当代马克思列宁主义最集中的表现——毛泽东思想，作为指南来继续领导我们和我国被剥削的人民，这是把我国人民从美帝国主义及其走狗的统治下解放出来的唯一办法。”
