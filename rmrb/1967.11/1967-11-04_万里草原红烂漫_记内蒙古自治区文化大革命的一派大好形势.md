In the northern frontier and anti-revisionist frontline of our motherland, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has washed the vast grasslands, making them even more radiant. The radiant thoughts of Chairman Mao illuminate the land. The Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been established. This marks that the 13 million people of various nationalities in Inner Mongolia, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have, after a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, announced the complete failure of the evil plot by the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Inner Mongolia to restore capitalism and split the great family of the motherland. They have achieved a great victory in defending the socialist mountains and rivers, safeguarding the unity of the motherland, and strengthening the unity of the people of all nationalities. Now, the entire autonomous region is in a state of great rejoicing. People are advancing victoriously in this great situation to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Beacon Guiding the Revolutionary People to Victory

Chairman Mao teaches us: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the entire people."

Over the past year, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been just like this. From the Great Xing'an Mountains to the Badain Jaran Desert, from Hohhot to the vast pastoral areas, from factories to rural areas, from government agencies, schools to street residents, from society to the family, all have entered the battlefield of a great struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads.

A small clique of capitalists within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party attempted to extinguish the blazing revolutionary flames. They implemented a bourgeois reactionary line from June to August last year, labeling a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." From February to May this year, they launched another capitalist restoration counter-current, once again labeling a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." In these five months, they deliberately confused the class lines, attempting to obstruct the forward march of history. However, the stupid enemies lifted a stone to drop it on their own feet. In this struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, between proletarian seizure of power and bourgeois counter-seizure of power, the enemy fully exposed themselves, and their performance created the conditions for their own downfall. The broad masses have become even stronger through this sharp and complex struggle.

In this extremely sharp and complex class struggle, the brave revolutionary organizations of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, such as "Hutou Sanwei," "August 18," and "Fire Engine," have always stood at the forefront of the struggle. Under their leadership, millions of revolutionary masses have joined this unprecedented Cultural Revolution. The elderly put up slogans and delivered messages for the revolutionary masses. Twelve- and thirteen-year-old students bravely and intelligently broke through numerous obstacles to send materials exposing counter-revolutionary restoration plots to Beijing.

"Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and you will fear nothing in the world!" The great thoughts of Mao Zedong have never been as widespread as they are today. People have further realized through their personal struggle experience that the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong are the beacon guiding the revolutionary people to victory, the red sun driving away the demonic fog for the revolutionary people!

	The Unprecedented Great Unity of All Nationalities

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle between nationalities, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue."

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has more than a dozen nationalities. Since liberation, Chairman Mao's nationality policy has promoted the great unity of all nationalities.

A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and national separatists in Inner Mongolia have long been madly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and nationality policy. On the one hand, they used the fallacies of "not dividing, not struggling, not delineating classes" and "steps should be steady, handling should be broad, time should be long" to resist the socialist revolution and protect the upper-class feudal pastoral lords, landlords, and bourgeoisie in the pastoral areas. On the other hand, they more viciously created national separatism, claiming that "emphasizing nationality issues is the greatest emphasis on politics" and crazily opposing Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "in the struggle between nationalities, class struggle appears in the form of national struggle." In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they incited national relations, attempting to lead the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads to the bourgeois nationalist path. However, the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary vanguard of various nationalities, armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, saw through the tricks of the class enemy. They did not use nationality to draw the battle lines but used class analysis to judge major issues of right and wrong based on the principle of whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and whether or not to follow the socialist road.

"Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will overthrow them!" This is the common battle slogan of the people of all nationalities.

In this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of all nationalities, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have fought shoulder to shoulder, establishing a common sentiment—unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and walking the same road—the happy socialist road. This is the solid foundation for the eternal unity of the people of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia.

The imperialists, Soviet revisionists, Mongolian revisionist leadership, and other reactionaries had high hopes for the counter-revolutionary revisionist and national separatist clique and sent spies to extend their black hands to subvert proletarian dictatorship. However, now the unprecedented great unity of all nationalities in Inner Mongolia has turned the enemy's beautiful dream into a wisp of smoke. The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed national unity to a new height.

	A New Generation is Growing Strong

Chairman Mao instructs us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The proletarian revolutionary vanguard of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, tempered by struggle, is growing stronger.

At the most difficult moment of the struggle, the proletarian revolutionary vanguard such as "Hutou Sanwei" had temporarily fallen into a disadvantageous position. But under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," they, with the heroic spirit of "not being a hero until reaching the Great Wall," firmly grasped the direction of the struggle and, united with the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary vanguard, broke through the darkness before dawn, repelled the capitalist restoration counter-current, and achieved decisive victory.

Of course, they are not without mistakes, but what is precious is that once they realized their mistakes, they bravely corrected them.

Not long after their victory, some people's minds began to swell with the "self" character: the issue of who is the core emerged; the phenomenon of "big faction oppressing small faction" appeared; cracks emerged within the revolutionary ranks that had once fought side by side, showing signs of "internal war."

At this critical moment, the responsible comrades of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group timely organized the revolutionary youngsters to sit down and personally studied Chairman Mao's works and the theories, lines, policies, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally formulated by Chairman Mao with them. They enthusiastically guided them to fight against the "self" character in their minds and invited comrades from worker and peasant organizations to warmly help the youngsters. The revolutionary youngsters received profound education, understanding that as reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, they could not for a moment leave Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "In the past difficult days of struggle, we seized every minute and second, with tears of joy, to study Chairman Mao's works. But after victory, due to relaxing the study of Chairman Mao's works, the 'self' character occupied the upper hand, which is dangerous!" Through study, the broad revolutionary youngsters truly realized that revolutionary leftists are not self-proclaimed but must seriously study the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, daring to overthrow others and daring to overthrow themselves. Through study, through self-criticism, through the ideological revolution of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, they finally avoided splitting, avoided "internal war," overcame the vacillation of petty-bourgeois ideology, and advanced the revolutionary ranks along the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Revolutionary Cadres Fight Together with the Masses

Chairman Mao affectionately calls on cadres at all levels: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better."

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has a considerable number of revolutionary cadres who faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's great instruction and played an important role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Especially, many cadres of the original Autonomous Region Party Committee and People's Committee have been fighting side by side with the proletarian revolutionary vanguard and have won the trust and support of the masses.

These revolutionary cadres, although they implemented the bourgeois reactionary line to varying degrees in the early stage of the movement and also made various mistakes in their work over a long period, had been impacted by the revolutionary youngsters. However, they followed Chairman Mao's great instruction, boldly went among the masses, and accepted the education of the masses. A secretary of the original Autonomous Region Party Committee, when he first arrived at the Normal University, had no common language with the proletarian revolutionary vanguard. However, after living with the revolutionary youngsters for five days and five nights, he began to realize the serious consequences of implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. When the youngsters denounced the bourgeois reactionary line, this cadre was moved to tears and finally established a deep affection with the youngsters, sincerely examined his mistakes, and decided to make revolution with the youngsters.

These revolutionary cadres, in fighting together with the masses, not only humbly learned from the masses but also played to their strengths of being politically more mature, having stronger organizational abilities, and having richer struggle experience, guiding the youngsters to grasp the policies and strategies of the struggle.

	The Iron Wall of the Frontier

Chairman Mao wisely asserts: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

The broad cadres and soldiers of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and various units stationed in Inner Mongolia have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call of "three supports and two militaries," excellently completed the glorious tasks of defending socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and established new merits for the people.

The People's Liberation Army listens to Chairman Mao the most. At the most intense moment of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, the People's Liberation Army firmly stood with the proletarian revolutionary vanguard and fought together. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party was terrified and hated the People's Liberation Army for supporting the proletarian revolutionary vanguard. They viciously incited the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary vanguard, deceiving and misleading some masses to attack the soldiers of the Liberation Army. However, the soldiers responded to the class enemy with steel-like voices: "You have misjudged us. We are an army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. No matter what methods you use, we will be with the proletarian revolutionary vanguard."

The People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary vanguard have forged a solid fighting friendship in the struggle between the two lines. When a proletarian revolutionary vanguard soldier has problems in his thoughts, the Liberation Army soldier will find him to study Chairman Mao's works together until the knot in his thoughts is untied.

On the battlefield of class struggle, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have been tempered and become even stronger. They say: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a classroom that cannot be found, a teacher that cannot be invited, and teaching materials that cannot be bought." The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary vanguard have learned good experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works from the Liberation Army, learned the good tradition of emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, and carrying forward the Three-Eight style from the Liberation Army, greatly strengthening their ideological revolution. Now the unity between the military and the people is as solid as a rock. It stands like an iron wall, firmly standing on the northern frontier of our country.

This year, due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution and promote production," the agricultural and pastoral production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have both achieved a rare great harvest in history, and both revolution and production are in a great situation. The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary vanguard are, in this great situation, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, breaking waves and advancing to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    万里草原红烂漫
    ——记内蒙古自治区文化大革命的一派大好形势
    在祖国北部边疆、反修前哨内蒙古自治区，无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨，把万里草原洗涤得更加明媚，光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照着大地。内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立了。这标志着内蒙古一千三百万各族人民在毛主席革命路线的光辉指引下，经过一场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争以后，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在内蒙古的代理人复辟资本主义、分裂祖国大家庭的罪恶阴谋的完全破产，取得了保卫社会主义江山，保卫祖国的统一和增强各民族人民的团结的伟大胜利。现在，全自治区到处一片欢腾，人们正在一派大好形势下乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
         指引革命人民走向胜利的灯塔
    毛主席教导我们：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    一年多来，内蒙古自治区无产阶级文化大革命的形势正是这样。从大兴安岭林区到巴彦淖尔沙漠，从呼和浩特到广大牧区，从工厂到农村，从机关、学校到街道居民，从社会到家庭，统统走上了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗的战场。
    内蒙古自治区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派妄图扑灭革命的熊熊烈火，曾在去年六月到八月推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命群众打成“反革命”。今年二月到五月，他们又刮起了一股反夺权的资本主义复辟黑风，再次把大批革命群众打成“反革命”。在这五个月之久的时间内，他们故意把阶级阵线搅乱，妄图阻挡历史车轮的前进。但是，愚蠢的敌人搬起石头砸了自己的脚。在这场革命与反革命、无产阶级夺权与资产阶级反夺权的决斗中，敌人充分暴露了自己，他们的表演为自己垮台创造了条件。广大群众在尖锐复杂的斗争实践中锻炼得更加坚强。
    在这场极其尖锐复杂的阶级搏斗中，英勇的内蒙古自治区“呼三司”、“八·一八”、“火车头”等革命组织，始终屹立在斗争的最前列。在他们带动下，千千万万的革命群众都投入了这场史无前例的文化大革命。老人们为无产阶级革命派张贴标语和传递消息。十二三岁的小学生，勇敢机智地冲破重重障碍，把揭发反革命复辟阴谋的材料送往北京。
    “读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，走遍天下都不怕！”伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样普及，人们从切身的斗争经验中进一步认识到，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是指引革命人民走向胜利的灯塔，是为革命人民驱散妖雾的一轮红日！
                各族人民空前的大团结
    毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”
    内蒙古自治区有十几个民族。解放以来，毛主席的民族政策促进了各民族的大团结。
    内蒙古一小撮反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义分子，曾经长期地丧心病狂地反对毛主席的革命路线和民族政策。他们一方面在牧区用“不分、不斗、不划阶级”以及“步子要稳，处理要宽，时间要长”等等谬论来抵制社会主义革命，保护上层封建牧主、地主和资产阶级；另一方面，更恶毒地制造民族分裂，胡说什么“突出民族问题就是最大的突出政治”，疯狂地反对毛主席的“在民族斗争中，阶级斗争是以民族斗争的形式出现的”这一光辉思想。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又挑拨民族关系，企图把两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争引向资产阶级民族主义的歧路。但是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的各民族的广大无产阶级革命派，识破了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。他们不是用民族来划分斗争的战线，而是用阶级分析的方法，从执行不执行毛主席的革命路线，走不走社会主义道路的原则立场上来判断大是大非问题。
      “谁反对毛主席，我们就打倒谁！”这是各民族人民共同的战斗口号。
    在这场波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，各族人民在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，并肩战斗，建立了共同的感情——无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，走着同一条道路——幸福的社会主义道路，这是内蒙古各族人民千秋万代团结的坚实基础。
    帝国主义，苏修、蒙修领导集团以及其它反动派，曾对反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团寄托无限希望，并且派出特务，伸出颠覆无产阶级专政的黑手。但是，现在内蒙古各民族的空前大团结，使敌人的美梦化为一缕青烟。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把民族大团结推进到一个新的高峰。
        一代新人正在茁壮地成长
    毛主席指示我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    内蒙古自治区的无产阶级革命派，经过斗争的冶炼，正在茁壮地成长。
    在斗争最困难的时刻，一直冲锋陷阵的“呼三司”等无产阶级革命派，曾暂时处于劣势。但他们在毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导下，以“不到长城非好汉”的英雄气魄，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，和广大无产阶级革命派团结一致，冲破黎明前的黑暗，击退了资本主义复辟逆流，取得了决定性的胜利。
    当然，他们并不是没有犯过错误，可贵的是他们一旦认识到自己错了，就勇敢地改正。
    刚刚胜利不久，有些人脑子里“私”字开始膨胀起来：以谁为核心的问题突出了；以山头压山头、大山头压小山头的现象出现了；曾经并肩战斗过的革命队伍内部出现了裂痕，露出了“打内战”的苗头。
    就在这个关键时刻，内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组的负责同志及时地组织革命小将们坐下来，亲自和他们一起学习毛主席著作以及由毛主席亲自制订的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，满腔热情地引导他们狠斗头脑里的“私”字，并且邀请工人和农民组织的战友对小将们进行了热情的帮助。革命小将们受到了深刻的教育，懂得了作为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人，一时一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。他们说：“过去在艰苦的斗争日子里，我们争分夺秒，含着热泪学习毛主席著作。可是胜利以后，由于放松了毛主席著作的学习，头脑里的‘私’字就占了上风，这真是危险啊！”通过学习，广大革命小将真正认识到，革命左派不是自封的，必须认真学习伟大的毛泽东思想，既敢于革别人的命，又敢于革自己的命。通过学习，通过自我批评，通过破私立公的思想革命，他们终于避免了分裂，避免了“内战”，战胜了小资产阶级的摇摆性，使革命队伍沿着毛泽东思想的轨道高歌猛进。
      革命领导干部和群众一起战斗
    毛主席亲切地向各级领导干部发出号召：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    内蒙古自治区有相当一批革命的领导干部，忠实地执行了毛主席的这一伟大指示，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中发挥了重要作用。特别是原自治区党委、人委有不少领导干部一直和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，取得了群众的信任和支持。
    这些革命的领导干部，虽然在运动初期不同程度地执行了资产阶级反动路线，并且在过去长时期的工作中也都有不少这样或那样的错误，因而曾经受到革命小将的冲击。但是他们遵照毛主席的伟大教导，大胆地到群众中去，接受群众的教育。原自治区党委一位书记，刚到师范学院的时候，同无产阶级革命派还没有共同语言，可是当他和革命小将一起生活了五天五夜之后，开始认识到自己执行资产阶级反动路线造成的严重后果。在小将们控诉资产阶级反动路线的时候，这位领导干部被感动得热泪盈眶，终于和革命小将建立了深厚感情，认真地检讨了自己的错误，决心和小将们一起闹革命。
    这些革命的领导干部在和群众共同战斗中，不但虚心地向群众学习，而且发挥了他们政治上比较成熟、组织能力较强、斗争经验比较丰富的特长，引导小将掌握斗争的政策和策略。
          边疆的钢铁长城
    毛主席英明地断言：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    中国人民解放军内蒙古军区和驻内蒙古各部队广大指战员，坚决执行了毛主席“三支”“两军”的伟大号召，出色地完成了保卫社会主义祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的光荣任务，为人民立下了新的功勋。
    人民解放军最听毛主席的话。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争最激烈的时刻，人民解放军坚定地和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起。内蒙古自治区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对人民解放军支持无产阶级革命派，吓得胆战心惊，恨得咬牙切齿。他们恶毒地挑拨人民解放军和广大无产阶级革命派的关系，欺骗、蒙蔽一部分群众围攻解放军战士。但是战士们用钢铁般的声音回答阶级敌人说：“你们看错了人，我们是无限忠于毛主席的军队。不管你们用什么样的办法，我们也要和无产阶级革命派在一起。”
    人民解放军和无产阶级革命派，在两条路线的斗争中，结下了牢固的战斗友谊。有那个无产阶级革命派战士思想上有了问题，解放军战士就找他一起学习毛主席著作，直到把思想上的疙瘩解开。
    在阶级斗争的战场上，人民解放军广大指战员锻炼得更加坚强。他们说：“无产阶级文化大革命，是找不到的课堂，请不到的老师，买不到的教材。”而广大的无产阶级革命派，则从解放军那里学到了活学活用毛主席著作的好经验，学到了突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的好传统，大大加强了自己的思想革命化。现在军民团结坚如磐石，它象一座钢铁的长城，牢固地屹立在我国北部边疆。
                        ×　×　×
    今年，内蒙古自治区广大革命群众由于执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，农牧业生产都获得了历史上少有的大丰收，革命和生产都是一片大好形势。广大无产阶级革命派，正在这种大好形势下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，乘风破浪，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
