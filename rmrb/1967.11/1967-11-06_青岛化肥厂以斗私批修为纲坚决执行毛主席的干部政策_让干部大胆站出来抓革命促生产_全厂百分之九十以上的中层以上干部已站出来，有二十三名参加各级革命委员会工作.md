The Qingdao Fertilizer Plant's proletarian revolutionary faction, with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the plant, has taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. Over 90% of the plant's mid-level and above cadres have come forward, with 23 of them participating in the work of various levels of revolutionary committees, playing a pivotal and core role. Because the cadre issue has been well resolved, the plant's revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have become increasingly solid, the revolutionary criticism has been carried out vigorously, and production has been thriving. From January to October, the plant's total fertilizer production increased by 12.76% compared to the same period last year.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant believes that to let revolutionary cadres come forward and boldly use revolutionary cadres, one must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policies on cadres. They say: Chairman Mao's policies on cadres are the guiding light for us to resolve the cadre issue, while fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism is the powerful driving force to ensure the implementation of Chairman Mao's policies on cadres.

Chairman Mao said: "After the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Since the proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant took power, they have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and placed the resolution of the cadre issue on the important agenda of the plant's revolutionary committee.

After analysis, the revolutionary faction of this plant believes that the vast majority of cadres in the plant are good or relatively good. Although many of them carried out the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this is a case of good people making mistakes. The revolutionary committee and the revolutionary faction decided to focus on the political and ideological education of cadres, using Mao Zedong Thought to address various erroneous thoughts among cadres, and help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Some cadres of this plant, due to their worldview not being well transformed and being poisoned by "The Cultivation of the Self," have a serious "self" problem in their minds. Some of them do not clearly recognize their mistakes and cannot bravely draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line; some have resistance towards the revolutionary faction. To address these active thoughts among cadres, this plant has held 13 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, specifically organizing cadres who made mistakes to study Chairman Mao's "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "Put Down Your Pack and Open the Machine," and the "Three Articles" and other brilliant works, learning while fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. At the same time, the study classes also let these cadres personally listen to the revolutionary faction members who had been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line to accuse the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in formulating and promoting the bourgeois reactionary line, helping these cadres to raise their awareness and better recognize their mistakes.

Through the study in the classes, some cadres realized that the reason they had resistance towards the revolutionary faction was mainly because they had a "self" in their minds. Only by fighting selfishness could they correctly treat the revolutionary actions of the masses and truly unite with the revolutionary faction in thought and emotion; only by fighting selfishness could they draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and engage in resolute struggle.

Recently, Chairman Mao taught us: "The method of having heart-to-heart talks is very good." The proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant also conducted political and ideological work with cadres through individual heart-to-heart talks. Before and after meals, before and after shifts, before and after meetings, one could often see revolutionary faction members and cadres who made mistakes having heart-to-heart talks. The revolutionary faction, with the purpose of "clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades," presented facts, explained reasons, and enthusiastically helped many cadres who made mistakes to quickly raise their awareness and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary committee and the proletarian revolutionary faction, while strengthening political and ideological work with cadres, also actively addressed the active thoughts among some revolutionary masses on the cadre issue.

Due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, there was still opposition between some revolutionary masses and cadres who made mistakes in this plant. Some revolutionary masses opposed the liberation of cadres who had carried out the bourgeois reactionary line; some said: "We fought and criticized him in the past, now let him come forward, if he comes back for revenge, we can't bear it," and so on. To correct these erroneous thoughts, the plant's revolutionary committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the plant, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organizing leaders of various levels of revolutionary committees, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, and some revolutionary masses in batches to study Chairman Mao's works on the cadre issue. At the same time, they carried out a revolutionary criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev in the cadre issue of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on believing and relying on the majority of cadres, and after studying Mao Zedong's theory, line, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they realized that whether or not to boldly liberate and use revolutionary cadres is a matter of attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

With their awareness raised, they further studied the "Three Articles," using the standard of completely and thoroughly serving the people, to expose and criticize their selfish thoughts in the cadre issue. Everyone realized that "self" is the biggest obstacle to correctly understanding and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policies. One must jump out of the "self" small circle and, from the standpoint of proletarian party spirit, deal with the cadre issue to correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policies. The revolutionary masses of the Mobile Machinery Workshop's Hoisting Group were severely persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. When someone proposed to liberate the original workshop party branch secretary Wang Daozhe, who had carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, they strongly opposed it. Later, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, through fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, they realized that Wang Daozhe was deceived and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, and should be enthusiastically helped to study Mao Zedong's works, correctly recognize his mistakes, learn from his lessons, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They did so, which deeply educated Wang Daozhe, who seriously examined his mistakes and finally came forward.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this plant, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, boldly uses cadres and further examines and improves them in the process of use. For those who have participated in the temporary power organs of the "three-in-one combination" at various levels and taken on leadership work, the revolutionary faction fully supports their correct leadership, enabling them to better perform their duties.

    青岛化肥厂以斗私批修为纲坚决执行毛主席的干部政策
    让干部大胆站出来抓革命促生产
    全厂百分之九十以上的中层以上干部已站出来，有二十三名参加各级革命委员会工作
    据新华社济南四日电  青岛化肥厂无产阶级革命派，在驻厂的解放军同志热情帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。全厂百分之九十以上的中层以上干部已经站了出来，其中有二十三名被吸收参加各级革命委员会工作，发挥了骨干作用和核心作用。由于干部问题解决得好，整个厂的革命大联合和革命三结合越来越巩固，革命大批判搞得轰轰烈烈，生产蒸蒸日上。一至十月份，全厂化肥的总产量比去年同期增加了百分之十二点七六。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派认为，要让革命干部站出来，大胆使用革命干部，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策。他们说：毛主席的干部政策，是指导我们解决好干部问题的指路明灯，而斗私批修则是保证毛主席的干部政策得以贯彻的强大推动力。
    毛主席说：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以来，就遵照毛主席的教导，把解决干部问题放到厂革命委员会的重要议事日程上来。
    经过分析，这个厂的革命派认为，全厂绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的，其中虽然有不少人在无产阶级文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，但，这是属于好人犯了错误。厂革命委员会和革命派决定大抓干部的政治思想教育，用毛泽东思想解决干部的各种错误思想，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    这个厂的一些犯错误的干部，由于世界观没有得到很好的改造，加上中了《修养》的毒害，头脑中严重地存在着“私”字。他们中间有的对自己的错误认识不清，不能勇敢地同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线划清界线；有的对革命派有抵触情绪。针对干部的这些活思想，这个厂先后开办了十三期毛主席著作学习班，专门组织犯错误的干部学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》《放下包袱，开动机器》以及“老三篇”等光辉著作，边学习边斗私批修。同时，学习班还让这些干部亲自听那些受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的革命派战士控诉中国赫鲁晓夫制定和推行资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行，帮助这些干部提高觉悟，更好地认识自己的错误。
    经过在学习班的学习，一些干部认识到他们之所以对革命派有抵触情绪，主要是自己头脑里有个“私”字，只有斗私，才能正确对待革命群众的革命行动，和革命派真正从思想感情上打成一片；只有斗私，才能同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界线，进行坚决的斗争。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。”这个厂的无产阶级革命派，还以个别谈心的方式，对干部进行政治思想工作。在饭前饭后，班前班后，会前会后，时常可以看到革命派群众和犯错误干部在促膝谈心，革命派抱着“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的目的，摆事实，讲道理，热情帮助不少犯错误的干部迅速提高觉悟，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    革命委员会和无产阶级革命派，在对干部加强政治思想工作的同时，针对部分革命群众在干部问题上的活思想，在群众中也积极地展开了工作。
    由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，这个厂部分革命群众和犯错误的革命干部之间还存在着对立情绪。有的革命群众反对解放执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部；有的说：“我们过去把他斗了、批了，现在让他站出来，他要是来一个‘秋后算账’，可吃不消”，等等。为了纠正这些错误思想，厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军同志的帮助下，开办了毛主席著作学习班，分期分批组织各级革命委员会负责人、革命群众组织负责人以及部分革命群众学习毛主席有关干部问题的著作。同时对中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线展开了革命的大批判。他们学习了毛主席的要相信和依靠干部的大多数的教导，学习了毛主席有关无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策以后，认识到能不能大胆解放和使用革命干部，是对毛主席的革命路线抱什么态度的问题。
    认识提高了，他们又进一步学习了“老三篇”，以完全、彻底为人民服务的标准，大亮、大斗在对待干部问题上的私心杂念。大家认识到，“私”字是正确理解和坚决执行毛主席干部政策的最大障碍。一定要跳出“私”字小圈子，从无产阶级的党性出发来对待干部，才能正确执行毛主席的干部政策。机动车间起重组的革命群众，在文化大革命初期受资产阶级反动路线的迫害较重。车间有人提出要把执行过资产阶级反动路线的原车间支部书记王道哲解放出来时，他们激烈反对。后来，在解放军同志的帮助下，通过斗私批修，他们认识到王道哲是受了蒙蔽才执行资产阶级反动路线的，应当热情帮助他学习毛主席著作，正确认识自己的错误，吸取教训，回到毛主席革命路线上来。他们这样做了，使王道哲受到深刻教育，认真地检查了自己的错误，终于站了出来。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派，坚决按照毛主席的教导，大胆使用干部，并且在使用的过程中进一步考察他们，提高他们。对于参加了各级“三结合”的临时权力机构，担任了领导工作的革命干部，革命派对于他们的正确领导都大力加以支持，使他们更好地行使自己的职责。
