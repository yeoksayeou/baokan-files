The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, in collusion with the Chinese Khrushchev, stands on the reactionary bourgeois position and hates the people's communes to death and is terrified of them. In 1962, he took advantage of the temporary difficulties brought about by three years of natural disasters and openly jumped out to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao and attack the people's communes. He ranted that "a considerable number of peasants demand the distribution of land... the peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is all nonsense and a pack of counter-revolutionary fallacies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Agriculture, from individual ownership to socialist collective ownership... will inevitably greatly liberate the productive forces. This will create the social conditions for greatly developing industrial and agricultural production." It is by relying on the collective power of the people's communes that we have fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants, overcome various natural disasters, ensured bumper harvests in agricultural production, and created miracles unprecedented in history. Take my hometown as an example. My hometown is in Huilong Village on the southern bank of the Zhang River in Wei County, Hebei Province. In the summer of 1961, our village suffered a drought. For three or four months, there was no rain, the Zhang River dried up, the leaves turned yellow, and the sorghum was gasping for breath. Even in flat areas, it was difficult to dig down half a foot to find moist soil, which brought serious difficulties to sowing. Facing the severe drought, our village party branch held an "anti-drought rally." All party members, youth league members, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants decided to move mountains with the spirit of Yu Gong, overcome all difficulties, and defeat the drought. Old poor peasant Shen Xi said: "We do not rely on heaven or earth, nor on the Dragon King or the Earth King. We rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the collective power of the people's commune." Thus, sheds were built in the fields, and the entire village's young and strong labored day and night in the fields. From the elderly over fifty or sixty years old to children seven or eight years old, everyone carried buckets and pots, planting grain by grain and watering hole by hole. After more than a month of struggle, relying on the amazing power of collective strength, the entire village sowed, planted, and cultivated a total of more than 2,500 mu of land, and still achieved a bumper harvest in the autumn. During the autumn harvest, poor peasant Zhang Tianlai held up a stalk of wheat like a wolf's tail and said: "This year, despite the severe drought, the crops grew so well. It is all thanks to Chairman Mao's blessings and the victory of the collective power of the people's commune! Remembering the year 1943, our village also suffered a drought. Seeing that the land could not be cultivated, I fled to Shanxi to beg for food, and my family of four starved to death. Now, despite the disaster, we have a good harvest. This is all the advantage of collectivization! We poor and lower-middle peasants must forever follow Chairman Mao and walk the path of collectivization." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants unanimously sang: "Collectivization, great power, fear no natural disasters." Through this anti-drought struggle, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have an even deeper understanding of the superiority of the people's commune and have an even stronger confidence and determination to follow the path of collectivization.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party says that "the peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is the howling of landlords and rich peasants and is absolutely not what the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants say. In our village, the landlord Zhao Yutang, while the poor and lower-middle peasants were fighting against the drought, spread rumors everywhere, shouting, "In such a year, it would be better to distribute the land to each household. Let those with ability cultivate it! Whether it's a black cat or a white cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat. As long as it can produce more crops, it's fine. If the land is not distributed to each household, the crops cannot be planted, it's still better to divide it up." This shows that the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's nonsense is completely in tune with the landlord class. He is the faithful spokesman of the landlord class. The peasants he refers to are absolutely not our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, but landlord elements and rich peasant elements. He is using the banner of "peasants" to incite the landlords and rich peasants to revolt, attempting to sabotage the people's communes and the socialist system, and drag us onto the capitalist road.

We revolutionary soldiers are the descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most. The path of collectivization of the people's communes, we will definitely follow. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party wants to stop us from following the path of collectivization of the people's communes, which is absolutely impossible. We will definitely follow the path of collectivization and march towards an even more beautiful communism. Whoever dares to block our way forward will be crushed by the wheels of history.

    贫下中农永远走集体化道路
    四七二○部队五好战士　锋锐
    党内另一个最大的走资派，和中国赫鲁晓夫串通一气，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，对人民公社恨得要命，怕得要死。一九六二年，他利用三年的自然灾害给我们带来的暂时困难，公然跳出来疯狂地反对毛主席，攻击人民公社。他胡说什么：“相当多的农民要求分配土地……，农民对集体经济丧失了信心。”这完全是一派胡言乱语，一派反革命谬论。
    毛主席教导我们说：农业“由个体所有制变为社会主义的集体所有制，……必然使生产力大大地获得解放。这样就为大大地发展工业和农业的生产创造了社会条件。”我们就是依靠人民公社集体力量，充分发挥了贫下中农的生产积极性，战胜了各种自然灾害，保证了农业生产的丰收，创造了历史上没有的人间奇迹。就拿我的家乡的事实来说吧。我家乡在河北省魏县漳河南岸的回隆村。一九六一年夏，我们村遭了旱灾，三、四个月没有下雨，漳河晒干了底，树叶枯黄了，春高粱也奄奄一息。平地半尺来深也挖不出湿土，给播种带来了严重的困难。面临着严重旱灾，我村党支部召开了“抗旱誓师大会”。全村党团员和广大贫下中农，决心以愚公移山的精神，排除万难，战胜旱灾。老贫农申喜说：“我们不靠天不靠地，不靠龙王、不靠地王，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是人民公社的集体力量。”这样，在地里搭了一个个工棚，全村青壮年日夜奋战在田间。上至五六十岁的老太太，下至七、八岁的儿童，都担桶提罐，一粒粒地种、一坑坑地浇。经过一个多月的战斗，依靠集体力量发出的惊人威力，全村播种、点种耕地共二千五百余亩，秋季照样获得了大丰收。在秋收的日子里，贫农张天来拿着狼尾巴似的谷穗说：“今年大旱，庄稼长得这样好，是托毛主席老人家的洪福，是人民公社集体力量的胜利啊！回想民国三十二年，咱村也遭了旱灾。眼看着地没法种，我逃到山西讨饭，饿死了我一家四口。现在受了灾，却获得了好收成，这都是集体化的好处啊！咱们贫下中农要永远紧跟毛主席，走集体化道路。”广大贫下中农齐声歌颂：“集体化，力量大，什么天灾都不怕。”广大贫下中农经过这场抗旱斗争，更加认识到人民公社的优越性，更加提高了走集体化道路的信心和决心。
    党内另一个最大的走资派说什么“农民对集体经济丧失了信心”，这是地主、富农的嚎叫，根本不是广大贫下中农说的话。我村地主赵玉堂，在贫下中农奋起抗旱的时候，就到处煽阴风，大嚷“这样的年景不如把土地分配到户，谁有能耐谁就种吧！不管黑猫白猫，捉住老鼠就是好猫。只要能多收庄稼就行，土地不分到户，庄稼就种不上，还是分开好呀。”这就看出，党内另一个最大的走资派的胡言乱语完全和地主阶级唱的是一个腔调。他就是地主阶级的忠实代言人。他所指的农民绝不是我们广大贫下中农，而是地主分子，富农分子，他是打着“农民”的旗号，叫地富翻天，妄图搞垮人民公社，搞垮社会主义制度，把我们拉到资本主义道路上去。
    我们革命战士是贫下中农的后代。我们广大贫下中农最听毛主席的话。人民公社集体化的道路我们走定了。党内另一个最大的走资派企图阻止我们走人民公社集体化的道路，一千个办不到，一万个办不到，我们就是坚定不移地走集体化的道路，一直奔向更加美好的共产主义。谁敢阻挡我们奋勇前进，就将被历史的车轮碾得粉碎。
