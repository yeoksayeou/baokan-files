	Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate that intellectuals go to the masses, go to the factories, go to the countryside." In conducting the proletarian educational revolution, we must also strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and go to the workers and peasants to humbly learn from them.

	How should we conduct the educational revolution and establish a new proletarian educational system to cultivate a new generation? Those with the most revolutionary struggle experience and production experience are the workers and peasants. They have the most authority to speak. From their personal experiences, they fully understand the kind of talent needed for socialist revolution and socialist construction, and they can provide insightful and profound criticisms of the old educational system. They are our best teachers. We should respectfully be their students.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing Normal University has stepped out of the campus, delved into factories and villages, conducted investigations among the workers and peasants, and together with them criticized the revisionist educational line promoted by China's Khrushchev. They have also studied reform plans for teaching, proving that good results have been achieved, which is a powerful demonstration.

	Learn from the Workers and Peasants, Take the Revolutionary Road to the End
	Beijing Normal University Education System Reform Group

	Education must be reformed. How? We believe that the most important thing is to thoroughly understand two aspects. First, Chairman Mao's educational thoughts are the highest guiding principles for conducting the educational revolution and the fundamental basis. We must strive to learn and deeply understand them. Second, we must start from reality, conduct investigations, learn from the masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses. In other words, we must learn from the masses and go to the masses.

	In early July of this year, after the reform group was established, there were discussions on how to carry out the work. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that we should go to the actual situation, go to the workers and peasants, learn from the masses, and start with investigations and research. Based on this understanding, comrades packed their bags and enthusiastically went deep into factories, villages, and schools. In nearly two months, they conducted a large amount of investigation and research work.

	The old educational system must be thoroughly reformed

	Through investigations and research, we further understood the consequences of the bourgeois educational line, strengthened our sense of responsibility for the educational revolution, and also explored some paths for educational reform.

	"Shorten the school system, revolutionize education, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not continue." Before going down to contact the masses, our understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction was not deep. Although we had studied in the old schools for more than ten years, some of us had even been teachers for more than ten years, but we were deeply poisoned, detached from the masses, and detached from reality. Our thoughts were somewhat numb. This investigation systematically understood the various crimes of the bourgeois educational line and, together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students and the workers and peasants, conducted a criticism. A large number of living facts gave us great enlightenment. We had a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction that "education must be revolutionized." Thus, conducting a thorough educational revolution became everyone's conscious demand.

	"Shocking!" This was the common conclusion reached by the reform group members after conducting extensive investigations at the grassroots level. We used Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution and a series of instructions to observe and analyze the current educational system. We discovered that the revisionist educational line promoted by China's Khrushchev in schools was heinous. Many schools, from the training objectives, teaching guidelines, teaching content, to teaching methods, had very serious problems. These problems boiled down to one point: the focus was on the admission rate. In other words, the direction of running schools was wrong. For example, in a middle school in Beijing, some teachers vigorously promoted the idea of "exam-oriented education," saying things like "if you don't study hard, you will only be able to sell soy sauce and vinegar in the future." To improve the admission rate, some class teachers even resorted to unscrupulous methods, using tactics like "persuading students to drop out," "forcing students to drop out," "repeating a grade," and "expelling" to gradually eliminate students with poor academic performance and those who were "disobedient." This school used the above methods, reducing a class that originally had more than fifty students to only about thirty by graduation. Most of those "eliminated" were children of workers and peasants. In another middle school in Beijing, the following two sentences were widely circulated among students: "Grades, grades, the lifeline of students; exams, exams, the magic weapon of teachers." Students, in order to cope with exams and get good grades, spent all day memorizing books, just for the sake of promotion and admission, seriously damaging their health. A student, because he could not be admitted to his "ideal" university, developed paranoid schizophrenia.

	The old curriculum, textbooks, and teaching methods indeed tied the students down, leaving them no energy to study Chairman Mao's works and participate in the three great revolutionary movements. Students spent all day listening to lectures, memorizing books, rushing to complete assignments, and competing for grades, with no room for independent thinking, and were not lively and vivid. Over time, their thoughts became rigid, and they lost the ability to analyze problems. Due to constant dizziness and tension, students' physical condition declined year by year. In a middle school in Beijing, the percentage of students with nearsightedness in the first year was about 10%, in the second year about 20%, and in the third year it reached about 40%. In addition, there were several students in each class of the second and third years who suffered from neurasthenia and neurotic disorders.

	The broad masses of workers and peasants deeply exposed the crimes of the bourgeois educational line. They pointed out with precision that the old educational system served the exploiting class and cultivated successors of the bourgeoisie. They expressed great indignation over the fact that a small handful of capitalist roaders within the party did not implement Chairman Mao's educational policies, did not emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, did not implement the party's class line, and that theory was seriously detached from reality, the school system was too long, and the teaching content was too complicated. A worker from the Beijing Shijingshan Steel Plant said: "In the past, schools taught a lot of useless things, produced a lot of defective products, and taught little about Mao Zedong Thought and social practice, production practice." In the Zhongyue Friendship People's Commune, there was a folk song criticizing the old educational system: "Middle school graduates, nine years of effort in vain, return to the team to be an accountant, the abacus is not fluent, go to the fields to work, equivalent to a female laborer."

	The workers and peasants are the masters of the educational revolution

	The process of investigation was actually the process of criticism and destruction. The broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary teachers and students gave us a vivid and lively class struggle course. It was a thorough cleansing and criticism of the influence of bourgeois educational thoughts on us, providing a solid ideological foundation for us to carry out the educational revolution.

	We are all teachers and students of the education system, studying education, engaging in education, and having done educational reform work in the past. Superficially, this seems to be a favorable condition. But in fact, we were deeply influenced by bourgeois educational thoughts, poisoned, and had more frameworks. Through this investigation and research, and by humbly learning from the masses, we deeply felt that it was the masses who liberated us from the shackles of bourgeois educational thoughts and guided us onto the path of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Facts have proven that the workers and peasants understand Chairman Mao's educational thoughts the best and apply them the best. They repeatedly pointed out our mistakes and broke our frameworks. The preliminary plan for teaching reform underwent five or six revisions, and each revision was "forced" by the masses.

	Should the promotion and retention system be abolished or retained? This is a question of reform and preservation. The broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary teachers and students are taking the revolutionary road to the end. In the investigation, someone initially proposed to abolish this system, but we did not accept it, believing that the promotion and retention system was to ensure teaching quality and could promote teaching. If abolished, students would have uneven levels, teaching would be difficult, and the level would be reduced. Students would also not study hard. Of course, we also believed that using students' academic performance as the sole standard for promotion and retention was unreasonable, so we found a so-called "reasonable" method: first, students, teachers, and leaders jointly evaluate and decide the promotion and retention of students; second, implement subject-based promotion and retention, allowing students to skip grades. The methods we proposed were widely solicited for opinions among the workers and peasants, and although some people advocated retaining the promotion and retention system, the majority were opposed. After analyzing these opinions from a class perspective, we realized that the masses' opinions were correct, while ours were reformist and compromising. Because the old promotion and retention system, as well as the examination system and enrollment system, were actually tools for bourgeois intellectuals to implement dictatorship in education. It was precisely this system that kept millions of workers and poor peasants' children out of school; it was precisely this system that resulted in the evil of emphasizing professional skills and neglecting politics; it was also precisely this system that tied students down, preventing them from fully exerting their initiative in learning. Therefore, the promotion and retention system must be thoroughly abolished, and the school should mainly rely on emphasizing politics and arousing students' initiative in learning.

	Chairman Mao said: "The current examination method is a method of dealing with the enemy, a sudden attack, asking eccentric and strange questions, and a method of examining eight-legged essays." In discussing the reform of the examination system with the masses, they clearly proposed that the purpose of the examination should be to promote learning. If the examination is mechanically reciting the textbooks, it loses its meaning. Concentrating the opinions of the masses, we proposed that the examination method should be argumentative, opposing the preliminary plan of recitation.

	Chairman Mao's educational thoughts are the compass of the educational revolution

	Stalin said: "Practice without revolutionary theory as a guide will become blind practice." Chairman Mao's educational thoughts are the highest guiding principles for the educational revolution. The process of investigation and research was also the process of our continuous learning, understanding, and applying Chairman Mao's educational thoughts. Before the investigation and research, we concentrated on studying Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" and other related educational discussions, which gave us a clear political direction in our work. During the investigation, we continued to study Chairman Mao's works, analyze the investigation materials, and find answers in Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems. For example, regarding the question of whether examinations and promotions should be retained, there was a debate among the masses. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we began to think about a question: work, what should we rely on? Is it political and ideological work first, or is it the dead system first? Different worldviews have different views. From the bourgeois perspective, the system is authority, using coercive methods to promote students' learning. This can only backfire. From the proletarian perspective, people are the first factor, political and ideological work is the first factor, and the system is secondary, playing an auxiliary role. Only by mobilizing people's subjective initiative and consciousness can teaching work be done well. Therefore, reforming the old examination, promotion, and enrollment systems, the most important and fundamental thing is to emphasize politics and emphasize Mao Zedong Thought.

	Recently, Chairman Mao issued the latest instructions on conducting the proletarian educational revolution. This is the greatest trust, support, and encouragement for us revolutionary teachers and students. We are determined to strive to learn Chairman Mao's educational thoughts and take the revolutionary road to the end.

### 向工农群众请教，走彻底革命的道路
北京师范大学教育系教改组

专栏：

    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去。”我们进行无产阶级教育革命，也完全应该遵照毛主席的教导，到工农群众中去，虚心向工农群众请教。
    怎样进行教育革命，创立新型的无产阶级教育制度，培养一代新人呢？最有革命斗争和生产斗争实践经验的工农群众，最有发言权。他们从切身体会中，完全知道社会主义革命和社会主义建设所需要培养的人材，完全能够对旧教育制度提出中肯和深刻的批评意见。他们是我们最好的先生。我们应该恭恭敬敬地做他们的小学生。
    北京师范大学的无产阶级革命派，走出校园，深入工厂农村，向工农群众作调查，和工农群众一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线，一起研究改革教学方案，已经取得了良好的经验，就是有力的证明。
    向工农群众请教，走彻底革命的道路
    北京师范大学教育系教改组
    教育必须改革。如何改？我们认为，最重要的是吃透两头。第一，毛主席的教育思想，是进行教育革命的最高指导思想，是最根本的依据，一定要努力学习、深入领会；第二，从实际出发，调查研究，向群众学习，集中群众的智慧，也就是说，要从群众中来，到群众中去。
    今年七月初，教改组成立后，对如何开展工作，是有争论的。经过讨论，一致认为，要到实际中去，到工农群众中去，向群众学习，从调查研究开始。在这样认识的基础上，同志们打起背包，兴高采烈地深入到工厂、农村和学校中去，在将近两个月的时间里，进行了大量的调查研究工作。
    旧的教育制度必须彻底改革
    通过调查研究，我们进一步认识了资产阶级教育路线的恶果，加强了教育革命的责任感，从中也摸索到一些教育改革的路子。
    “学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”对毛主席的这一指示，我们在没有下去接触群众以前，理解是不深刻的。虽然我们在旧学校中学习了十几年，有的还当了十几年的教师，但中毒太深，又脱离群众、脱离实际，思想都有点麻木了。这次调查，系统地了解了资产阶级教育路线的种种罪行，并与广大的革命师生、工农群众一起进行了批判。大量活生生的事实，给我们很大启发。我们对毛主席“教育要革命”的指示，有了深刻的认识。这样，进行一场彻底的教育革命，也就成了大家的自觉要求。
    “触目惊心！”这是教改组同志在深入基层进行大量调查工作之后，得出的一个共同结论。我们运用毛主席关于教育革命的思想和一系列的指示，去观察和分析现行的教育制度，发现中国赫鲁晓夫在学校中推行的一套修正主义教育路线，罪恶滔天。许多学校从培养目标、教学指导思想到教学内容和教学方法，都存在着十分严重的问题。这些问题集中到一点，就是升学率挂帅。也就是说，办学的方向是错误的。例如，北京市一个中学，有的教师向学生大力传播“升学至上”的思想，说什么“你不努力学习，将来就只能去打酱油、卖醋”。为了提高升学率，有些班主任竟不择手段，采取“搬掉绊脚石”的办法，把学习成绩差的、所谓“不听话”的学生，用“劝告退学”、“勒令退学”、“留级”、“开除”等等名目逐步淘汰出去。这个学校采用上述办法，使一个原有五十多人的班，在毕业时只剩下三十多人了。被“淘汰”出去的，大多数都是工农的子女。北京另一个中学的学生中，普遍流行这样两句话：“分，分，学生的命根；考，考，老师的法宝。”学生为了应付考试，得个好分数，一天到晚死啃书本，为的就是升级、升学，严重地损害了健康。有个学生，因为升不了自己“理想”的大学，竟得了妄想型的神经分裂症。
    过去的一套课程、教材和教学方法，确实是把学生束缚死了，弄得学生没有精力学习毛主席著作和参加三大革命运动。学生成天听课、背书，赶做作业，争分数，毫无独立思考的余地，没有生动活泼可言。久而久之，思想僵化，丧失分析问题的能力。由于终日晕头转向，精神紧张，学生体质逐年下降。北京一个中学，初一患近视眼的为百分之十左右，初二为百分之二十左右，初三则达到百分之四十左右。此外，患神经衰弱、神经官能症的，二、三年级各班都有几个。
    广大的工农群众，对资产阶级教育路线的罪行，进行了深刻的揭露。他们一针见血地指出，旧教育制度是为剥削阶级服务的，培养的是资产阶级的接班人。他们对过去党内一小撮走资派不执行毛主席的教育方针，不突出毛泽东思想，不执行党的阶级路线，理论严重脱离实际，学制年限太长，教学内容繁琐，等等，都表示了极大的愤慨。北京石景山钢铁厂一位工人说：“过去的学校学习无用的东西多，出废品多，学习毛泽东思想少，社会实践、生产实践少。”在中越友好人民公社，有一首控诉旧的教育制度的顺口溜：“初中毕业生，白费九年功，回队当会计，算盘不灵通，下地干农活，顶个妇女工。”
    工农群众是教育革命的主人
    调查的过程，实际上就是批判的过程，“破”的过程。广大的工农群众、革命师生给我们上了活生生的大批判课。对我们所受的资产阶级教育思想的影响，是一次思想上的大清理、大批判，为我们搞教育革命提供了思想基础。
    我们都是教育系的师生，是学教育的，搞教育的，过去也搞过教育改革的工作。表面上看，这是有利的条件。但事实上，我们受资产阶级教育思想的影响多，中毒很深，框框更多。经过这次调查研究，虚心向群众学习，我们深深感到，是群众把我们从资产阶级教育思想的束缚下解放出来，是群众把我们引导到毛泽东思想的轨道上来。
    事实证明，工农群众理解毛主席的教育思想最好，运用得也最好。他们一次又一次地指出了我们的错误，破了我们的框框。教学改革初步方案经过了五、六次修改，每一次修改，都是群众“逼”出来的。
    升留级制度究竟是废除还是保留？这是一个革和保的问题。广大工农群众和革命师生是走彻底革命的道路的。在调查中，开始有人提出要废除这种制度，但我们没有接受，认为升留级制度是为了保证教学质量，可以促进教学；如果废除，学生程度不齐，教学有困难，会降低水平，学生也会不好好学习。当然，我们也认为单纯地以学生学习成绩好坏作为升留级标准是不合理的，于是寻找了所谓“合理”的方法：一，由学生、教师、领导三结合评定，决定学生的升留级；二，实行分科升留级，允许跳级学习。我们提出的方法，拿到工农群众中去广泛征求意见，虽然也有人主张保留升留级制度，但大多数人是反对的。对这些意见进行了阶级分析后，我们认识到，群众的意见是正确的，而我们的意见则是改良主义的、折衷的。因为旧的升留级制度，以及考试制度、招生制度，事实上是资产阶级知识分子在教育上实行专政的一种工具。正是这种制度，把千千万万工人、贫下中农的子弟拒之学校的门外；正是这种制度，形成了突出业务、忽视政治的恶果；也正是这种制度，把学生束缚得紧紧的，不能充分发挥学生在学习中的主动精神。因此，升留级制度必须彻底废除，学校主要靠突出政治，靠启发学生的学习自觉性。
    毛主席说：“现在的考试方法是对付敌人的办法，是突然袭击，出偏题怪题，尽是考八股文的办法。”在和群众讨论改革考试制度时，他们明确地提出，考试的目的应当是为了促进学习，如果机械地复述教材便失去了考试的意义。集中群众的意见，于是，我们提出了考试方法应该是辩论性的，反对回忆性的初步方案。
    毛主席的教育思想是教育革命的指针
    斯大林说：“实践若不以革命理论为指南，就会变成盲目的实践。”毛主席的教育思想是教育革命的最高指导思想。调查研究的过程，就是我们不断学习、领会和运用毛主席教育思想的过程。我们在调查研究之前，集中学习了毛主席的“五·七”指示和其他有关教育的论述，使我们在工作中有了明确的政治方向。在调查过程中，我们又不断学习毛主席著作，对调查的材料进行分析，遇到问题时从毛主席著作中找答案。如关于考试、升留级要不要的问题，在群众中是有争论的。我们学习了毛主席的指示后，开始思考一个问题：工作，究竟以什么作依靠？是政治思想工作第一，还是死的制度第一？不同的世界观，有不同的看法。从资产阶级的观点看，制度就是权威，使用强制性的办法来促进学生学习。这只能适得其反。从无产阶级的观点看，人的因素第一，政治思想工作第一，制度是次要的，起辅助的作用。只有调动人的主观能动性、自觉性，才能搞好教学工作。因此，改革旧的考试、升留级、招生制度，首先要破除对这些制度的迷信，而新的考试、升留级、招生制度，最重要最根本的，就是要突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。
    最近，毛主席发出了进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，这是对我们革命师生的最大信任，最大支持和最大鼓舞。我们决心努力学习毛主席的教育思想，走彻底革命的道路。
