Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Institute of Physical Education's revolutionary students, teachers, and workers actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, teaching and reforming simultaneously, taking the first step on the road of educational revolution.

The Beijing Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Institute of Physical Education, with "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the guiding principle, promoted the educational revolution. At the beginning of the resumption of classes and the initiation of revolution, some teachers had reservations: "There is no new curriculum to teach, and teaching the old one might provoke student rebellion. What should we do?" They brought this question to the study of Chairman Mao's works, actively criticized the erroneous idea of "waiting for reforms to be completed before teaching," and established the resolve and confidence to "persist in what is good for the people and correct what is wrong for the people." Most teachers discarded the fear and replaced it with daring, expressing their willingness to teach boldly and reform daringly.

Establishing a proletarian educational system is an unprecedented great historical task. How to reform? Where to start? These were the first questions they encountered. Comrade Jiang Qing's great initiative in reforming Peking Opera set a brilliant example for the educational revolution. The revolutionary committee of the institute studied the situation of various projects and decided to start the reform with martial arts and gymnastics, as martial arts had the most feudal dross and gymnastics had the strongest revisionist smell. To carry out this work, they dispatched a special team composed of a few revolutionary teachers and students to factories, rural areas, and the military to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers and jointly carry out reforms. At the same time, revolutionary teachers and students in the gymnastics major, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, created the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" gymnastics with workers, peasants, and soldiers, raising the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the broadcast gymnastics field, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Currently, the reforms of broadcast gymnastics, martial arts, and gymnastics have been completed, and some experiences and insights have been initially summarized and promoted throughout the institute. The reforms of these three projects have played a driving role in the educational revolution of the entire institute.

The rapid development of the educational revolution has changed the past organizational structure that served the bourgeois educational line. Revolutionary teachers and cadres broke free from the constraints of offices and research rooms, joining student classes by department and by grade. Members of the revolutionary committee of the institute all went deep into the classes, working with the revolutionary teachers and students to carry out struggle, criticism, and transformation. Revolutionary teachers and students unanimously agreed: to resume classes and make revolution, one must teach and reform simultaneously. In the past, martial arts classes taught basic fist techniques, which students found dull and difficult to master; now, they teach the "Quotations Fist," which is both a martial arts class and a class on Mao Zedong Thought, and students' enthusiasm for learning is very high, and they master the movements quickly. In the past, teaching content was monopolized by teachers, but now students arrange it themselves, changing the situation where students revolved around teachers, greatly arousing students' initiative and enthusiasm for learning.

    边教学　边改革
    北京工农兵体育学院通过实践改革了三个体育项目
    本报讯　北京工农兵体育学院广大革命的学生、教员、工人，积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，边教学，边改革，在教育革命的道路上迈出了第一步。
    北京工农兵体育学院以“斗私，批修”为纲，推动教育革命。在开始复课闹革命时，有些教师思想有顾虑：“教新的没有，教旧的又怕学生造反，怎么办？”他们带着这个问题学习毛主席著作，主动批判了“等改好了再上课”的错误思想，树立了“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”的决心和信心。大多数教师都丢掉了怕字，换上了敢字，表示敢教学，敢大胆改革。
    建立无产阶级教育制度，是史无前例的伟大历史任务。怎样改？从何着手？是他们首先碰到的问题。江青同志抓京剧改革的伟大创举，为教育革命树立了光辉的样板。院革命委员会研究了各个项目的情况，认为武术的封建糟粕最多，体操的修正主义气味最浓，就决定先从武术、体操开始改革。为了做好这一工作，他们派出由少数革命师生组成的专门队伍，有计划有目的地到工厂、农村、部队，向工农兵学习，同工农兵一起进行改革。同时，体操专业的革命师生根据工农兵的要求，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，和工农兵一起创编了《毛主席语录操》，在广播操阵地上插上了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，受到广大工农兵的热烈欢迎。目前，广播操、武术、体操的改革已告一段落，并初步总结了一些经验、体会在全院推广。这三个项目的改革，对全院教育革命起了推动作用。
    教育革命的迅猛发展，改革了过去那一套为资产阶级教育路线服务的组织机构。革命的教师、干部都冲破了办公室、教研室的束缚，按系、按年级编入学生班。院革命委员会的成员都深入班级，与广大革命师生一起搞斗批改。广大革命师生一致认为：复课闹革命，必须一边教学，一边改革。过去武术课是上初级拳，学生感到枯燥无味，不易掌握；现在改上语录拳，既是武术课，又是毛泽东思想课，学生学习积极性很高，掌握动作又快。过去教学内容由教员包办，现在由学生自己安排，改变了学生围着教师转的情况，大大调动了学生学习的主动性和积极性。
