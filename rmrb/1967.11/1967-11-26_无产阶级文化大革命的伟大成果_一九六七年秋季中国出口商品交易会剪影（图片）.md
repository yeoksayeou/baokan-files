Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 1967 Autumn China Export Commodities Fair opened grandly in Guangzhou.

This fair, with its fresh appearance and unprecedented scale, reflects the great achievements of our people in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out the "revolutionary struggle, promote production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It reflects the great achievements of our socialist construction and the thriving development of our foreign trade. Friends from the trade circles of various countries and regions around the world, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, are all thrilled and enthusiastic, praising the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries bark like mad dogs, maliciously slandering and viciously attacking our fair. The prosperous scene of the fair has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy.

At the fair, we were delighted to see the touching scenes of friends from various countries around the world and overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao expressing their boundless love for our greatest leader, the great mentor of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. Today's world has entered a new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become a mass movement on a global scale. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought will spread more rapidly and widely throughout the world, and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought will illuminate the entire world!

    无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果
    ——一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会剪影
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会在广州隆重开幕了。
    这次交易会，以崭新的面貌和空前盛大的规模，反映了我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命中“抓革命，促生产”的伟大成果，反映了我国社会主义建设的伟大成就，反映了我国对外贸易事业的蓬勃发展。来自世界各国、各地区的贸易界朋友，海外华侨和港澳同胞，无不为之欢欣鼓舞，热情赞颂毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，狂犬吠日，对我们的交易会进行了无耻的诽谤和恶毒的攻击。交易会欣欣向荣的景象，给了敌人以沉重的打击。
    在交易会上，我们高兴地看到了世界各国朋友和海外华侨、港澳同胞对我们最伟大的领袖、世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席无限热爱的动人情景。今天的世界，已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。学习和运用毛泽东思想已经成为一个世界范围的群众运动。战无不胜的毛泽东思想将在全世界更迅速、更广泛地传播，毛泽东思想的无际光焰照亮全世界！
