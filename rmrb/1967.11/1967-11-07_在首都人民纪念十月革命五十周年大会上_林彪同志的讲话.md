Comrades, Red Guards, young revolutionaries, friends:

Today, the people of our country, together with the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world, solemnly commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

The great October Revolution led by Lenin was a turning point in human history.

The victory of the October Revolution shattered the dark rule of capitalism, established the first proletarian dictatorship in the world, and opened a new era of world proletarian revolution.

Since Marx and Engels founded the scientific theory of socialism, the international proletariat has, for over a hundred years, fought tirelessly and heroically to realize the great ideal of communism, making immortal contributions to the cause of human liberation.

In his struggle against the revisionism of the Second International and in leading the great practice of the October Socialist Revolution, Lenin solved a series of problems regarding proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, solved the problem of the victory of socialism in one country, and developed Marxism to the stage of Leninism. Leninism is Marxism for the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. The October Revolution's cannon blast brought Leninism to the entire world, changing the face of the world.

Over the past fifty years, the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, have, following the path of the October Revolution, pushed world history into a new era—an era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. This is a great new era of the final showdown between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on a global scale.

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after achieving victory in the national democratic revolution, have also achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Socialist China has become a strong fortress of world revolution. The heroic people of Albania have steadfastly followed the path of the October Revolution and have raised a brilliant red flag in Europe. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation has set a brilliant example for the anti-imperialist struggle of all peoples of the world. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing rapidly. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are continually swelling, and the international communist movement is presenting a new situation.

Now, compared to half a century ago, the content of the world proletarian revolution is much deeper, the scale is much broader, and the struggle is much more intense. The new historical era presents a series of new major problems to Marxists-Leninists. However, fundamentally, it is still the most fundamental issue of seizing and consolidating power.

Chairman Mao has said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." This is a great truth of Marxism-Leninism.

The struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism has always been focused on this fundamental issue. The modern revisionism represented by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, crazily opposes the world people's revolution, openly abolishes the proletarian dictatorship, and carries out a comprehensive restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. This is a great betrayal of the October Revolution. This is a great betrayal of Marxism-Leninism. This is a great betrayal of the great Soviet people and all the people of the world. Therefore, if we do not thoroughly smash the rampant attacks of modern revisionism, if we do not resolutely defend the great path of the October Revolution opened by Lenin, and if we do not, under the new historical conditions, continue to advance along this path and thoroughly solve the problem of how to seize and consolidate power, the proletariat will not be able to achieve final victory. Even if power is seized, it is still possible to lose it again, just like the Soviet people, and be ruled by a new bourgeois privileged class.

Fortunately, due to Comrade Mao Zedong's comprehensive inheritance and development of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, the most fundamental problem of the world proletarian revolution, that is, the problem of the path to seizing and consolidating power, has been raised to a higher stage both in theory and practice. Our great leader Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new and lofty peak. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have experienced the longest, most intense, most arduous, and most complex people's revolutionary war in the history of the world proletarian revolution, establishing a red political power of proletarian dictatorship.

The path led by Chairman Mao to seize power by armed force can be summarized as: under the leadership of the proletarian party, mobilize the peasant masses in rural areas to wage guerrilla warfare, carry out land revolution, establish rural base areas, surround the cities from the countryside, and finally seize the cities. This is a new and great development of the path of seizing power by armed force in the October Revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "The victory of revolution always begins first in places where the forces of counter-revolution are relatively weak, develops first, and achieves victory first." In the contemporary world, since all reactionary ruling classes tightly control the central cities, revolutionary parties must make use of the weak links and weak areas of reactionary rule, fully mobilize the masses, wage guerrilla warfare, create a solid revolutionary base area, in order to accumulate and temper their own strength, and gradually achieve complete victory in the revolution through long-term struggle. Therefore, relying on the masses, establishing rural revolutionary base areas, and surrounding the cities from the countryside, these are historical tasks that must be seriously considered and solved by the oppressed nations and peoples of the world in their struggle to seize power by armed force.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only creatively developed Leninism in the problem of the proletariat seizing power but also, in the contemporary most important problem of consolidating proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration, epoch-makingly and creatively developed Leninism.

From the first day of the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin paid great attention to consolidating the newly born Soviet power. He saw the sharpness and longevity of class struggle under the proletarian dictatorship and pointed out: "The transition from capitalism to communism is a whole historical epoch. As long as this epoch has not ended, the exploiters will inevitably harbor hopes of restoration and turn these hopes into restoration actions."

The restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries is the greatest lesson in the history of the international communist movement over the past fifty years. This cruel fact has prominently placed the problem of how to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration before all Marxists-Leninists in the world.

It is precisely the great teacher of the contemporary world proletariat, Comrade Mao Zedong, who, under new historical conditions, systematically summarized the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship internationally, scientifically analyzed the contradictions of socialist society, deeply revealed the laws of class struggle in socialist society, and proposed a complete set of theories, lines, policies, methods, and policies for continuing the revolution under the proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao, with his great vision and high wisdom, led the first great proletarian cultural revolution in history to victory. This is a very significant mark of the development of Marxism-Leninism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The victory of the proletarian cultural revolution has opened up a bright path to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and carry the socialist revolution through to the end in China, which has a quarter of the world's population. The proletariat and revolutionary people of the world who are fighting against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, resolutely support our proletarian cultural revolution. They draw great inspiration from the victory of our proletarian cultural revolution, see a bright future, and strengthen their confidence in victory.

The imperialists led by the United States and their running dogs, the modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries, have exhausted all their efforts to curse and defame our proletarian cultural revolution. This, on the contrary, proves that our victory has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy, and they are just a group of vampires that are bound to perish.

The world is moving forward. The theory that reflects the laws of the world is also developing continuously.

Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our era.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the oppressed nations and peoples can obtain liberation through their own struggles.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, countries that have already established proletarian dictatorship can, through their own struggles, prevent capitalist restoration.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the people of countries whose power has been usurped by revisionism can, through their own struggles, overthrow the rule of revisionism and restore proletarian dictatorship.

Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought combined with the revolutionary practice of all peoples of the world can smash the old world to pieces.

Comrades, Red Guards, young revolutionaries, friends:

The fifty years since the October Revolution have been fifty years of intense struggle and victory between socialism and capitalism, Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. The imperialist system has long been on the verge of collapse, gasping for breath. The emergence of Khrushchev revisionism is a product of imperialist policy, reflecting the struggles of imperialism on its deathbed. Although imperialism and revisionism may collude to cause trouble, the reactionary tide will never become the mainstream. The dialectics of history are irresistible. In the future, the world proletariat and revolutionary people will raise the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought even higher and advance in big strides along the path begun by the October Revolution!

All those who betray the October Revolution will absolutely not escape the punishment of history. Khrushchev has already fallen. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique is even more treacherous in carrying out betrayal policies, and their days are numbered. The glorious revolutionary tradition of the Soviet proletariat and working people will not forget the teachings of the great Lenin and Stalin. They will certainly rise up under the banner of Leninism, overthrow the rule of the revisionist reactionary clique, and bring the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track.

Comrades, Red Guards, young revolutionaries, friends!

Our great motherland is in a great situation. The proletarian cultural revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is advancing victoriously.

We must raise the great banner of the October Revolution even higher, raise the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

We must build our great motherland into an even stronger world revolutionary base.

We must more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the world proletariat and the peoples of various countries.

We must, together with the revolutionary people of the whole world, carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist traitor clique through to the end.

We must strive even harder to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought and spread Mao Zedong Thought more widely throughout the world.

This is the glorious mission bestowed upon us by history, and it is the internationalist duty of the Chinese people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has called: "All Marxists-Leninists of the world, unite! All revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without an exploitative system, must be established."

Let us struggle bravely to realize Chairman Mao's great call!

Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Workers of the world, unite!

Workers of the world and oppressed peoples and nations, unite!

Long live the invincible Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

### 在首都人民纪念十月革命五十周年大会上  林彪同志的讲话

    在首都人民纪念十月革命五十周年大会上
    林彪同志的讲话同志们，红卫兵小将们，朋友们：
    今天，我国人民同全世界无产阶级和革命人民一道，隆重纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年。
    伟大列宁领导的十月革命，是人类历史的转折点。
    十月革命的胜利，冲破了资本主义的黑暗统治，建立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家，开辟了无产阶级世界革命的新纪元。
    自从马克思、恩格斯创立科学社会主义的学说以来，国际无产阶级为了实现共产主义的伟大理想，前赴后继，英勇牺牲，进行了一百多年的艰苦斗争，为人类的解放事业立下了不朽的功勋。
    列宁在对第二国际修正主义的斗争中，在领导十月社会主义革命的伟大实践中，解决了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的一系列问题，解决了社会主义在一个国家内胜利的问题，把马克思主义发展到了列宁主义的阶段。列宁主义就是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。十月革命一声炮响，把列宁主义带到了全世界，使世界的面目为之一新。
    五十年来，全世界无产阶级和革命人民，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，沿着十月革命的道路，把世界历史推进到了又一个崭新的时代，这就是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。这是无产阶级和资产阶级在全世界进行大决战的伟大新时代。
    中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，在民族民主革命胜利之后，又取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。社会主义的中国已经成为世界革命的坚强堡垒。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，坚持了十月革命的道路，在欧洲竖起了一面鲜艳的红旗。越南人民的抗美救国战争，为全世界人民反帝斗争树立了光辉的榜样。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，正在猛烈发展。马克思列宁主义的队伍不断壮大，国际共产主义运动出现了新局面。
    现在，和半个世纪以前相比，世界无产阶级革命的内容要深刻得多了，规模要广阔得多了，斗争要激烈得多了。新的历史时代在马克思列宁主义者面前，提出了一系列新的重大问题。但是，归根结底，仍然是夺取政权、巩固政权这个最根本的问题。
    毛主席说过：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”这是一个马克思列宁主义的伟大真理。
    马克思列宁主义同修正主义的斗争，从来就是集中在这个根本问题上。以赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为代表的现代修正主义，疯狂地反对世界人民革命，公然取消无产阶级专政，在苏联实行资本主义的全面复辟。这是对十月革命的大背叛。这是对马克思列宁主义的大背叛。这是对伟大的苏联人民和全世界人民的大背叛。因此，如果不彻底粉碎现代修正主义的猖狂进攻，不坚决起来捍卫伟大列宁所开辟的十月革命道路，并在新的历史条件下沿着这条道路继续前进，彻底解决如何夺取政权和巩固政权的问题，无产阶级就不能获得最后胜利，即使夺得了政权，仍然有可能重新丧失政权，象苏联人民那样，被新的资产阶级特权阶层所统治。
    值得我们庆幸的是，由于毛泽东同志全面地继承和发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，世界无产阶级革命的这个最根本的问题，即夺取政权和巩固政权的道路问题，已经在理论上和实践上提高到了更高的阶段。我们伟大的领袖毛主席，把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的高峰。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利时代的马克思列宁主义。
    毛主席在领导中国革命的伟大斗争中，天才地解决了武装夺取政权的一系列复杂的课题。在毛主席领导下，中国人民经历了世界无产阶级革命史上最长期、最激烈、最艰苦、最复杂的人民革命战争，建立了无产阶级专政的红色政权。
    毛主席领导中国人民武装夺取政权的道路，概括起来，就是在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村中发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。这是十月革命武装夺取政权道路的新的伟大发展。
    毛主席说：“革命的胜利总是从那些反革命势力比较薄弱的地方首先开始，首先发展，首先胜利”。在当代，由于一切反动统治阶级总是严密地控制着中心城市，革命的政党就必须利用反动统治的薄弱环节，薄弱地带，充分发动群众，进行游击战争，造成革命的巩固的根据地，以便积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，在长期战斗中，逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。因此，依靠群众，建立农村革命根据地、以农村包围城市，这些都是今天世界上被压迫民族和被压迫人民为武装夺取政权而奋斗时所必须认真思考和解决的历史任务。
    毛泽东同志不仅在无产阶级夺取政权的问题上，创造性地发展了列宁主义，而且在巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟这个当代最重大的问题上，划时代地、创造性地发展了列宁主义。
    列宁从十月革命胜利的第一天起，就十分重视巩固新生的苏维埃政权。他看到了无产阶级专政下阶级斗争的尖锐性、长期性，指出：“从资本主义过渡到共产主义是一整个历史时代。只要这个时代没有结束，剥削者就必然存着复辟希望，并把这种希望变为复辟行动。”
    苏联和其他一些社会主义国家出现了资本主义复辟，这是五十年来国际共产主义运动史上最大的教训。这一严酷的事实，把如何巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的问题，突出地提到了全世界马克思列宁主义者面前。
    正是当代世界无产阶级的伟大导师毛泽东同志，在新的历史条件下，系统地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，科学地分析了社会主义社会的矛盾，深刻地揭示了社会主义社会的阶级斗争规律，提出一整套关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。毛主席以他伟大的气魄，高度的智慧，胜利地领导了历史上第一次无产阶级文化大革命。这是马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想阶段的一个极其重大的标志。
    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，在占世界人口四分之一的中国，开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政、将社会主义革命进行到底的光明大道。正在同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的全世界无产阶级和革命人民，都坚决地支持我们的无产阶级文化大革命，他们从我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利中，得到了极大的鼓舞，看到了光明的前途，增强了胜利的信心。
    以美国为首的帝国主义者和他们的走狗现代修正主义者和各国反动派，他们费尽心机，咒骂、毁谤我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正好从反面证明了我们的胜利对敌人的打击是多么沉重，而他们只是一群必将灭亡的吸血鬼而已。
    世界是向前发展的。反映世界规律的理论也在不断发展。
    毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜。
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，被压迫民族和被压迫人民，就能够经过自己的斗争，得到解放。
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家，就能够经过自己的斗争，防止资本主义复辟。
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，被修正主义篡夺了政权的国家的人民，就能够经过自己的斗争，推翻修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级专政。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同全世界各国人民的革命实践相结合，就可以把整个旧世界打得落花流水。
    同志们，红卫兵小将们，朋友们：
    十月革命以来的五十年，是社会主义同资本主义、马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义激烈搏斗、并节节取得胜利的五十年。帝国主义制度早已日薄西山，气息奄奄。赫鲁晓夫修正主义的出现，是帝国主义政策的产物，反映了帝国主义临死前的挣扎。尽管帝国主义和修正主义还会勾结起来进行捣乱，但是，反动的逆流终究不会变成主流。历史的辩证法是不可抗拒的。今后，世界无产阶级和革命人民，将会更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，沿着十月革命开始的道路大踏步前进！
    一切背叛十月革命的人，绝对逃脱不了历史的惩罚。赫鲁晓夫早就垮台了。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团变本加厉地实行叛卖政策，他们的寿命也是长不了的。具有光荣革命传统的苏联无产阶级和劳动人民，决不会忘记伟大列宁和斯大林的教导。他们一定会在列宁主义的旗帜下起来革命，推翻修正主义反动集团的统治，使苏联重新回到社会主义的轨道上来。
    同志们，红卫兵小将们，朋友们！
    我们的伟大祖国是一片大好形势。无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的指引下，正在胜利地向前发展。
    我们一定要更高地举起十月革命的伟大旗帜，更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们一定要把我们伟大的祖国建设成为更加强大的世界革命根据地。
    我们一定要更有力地支援世界无产阶级和各国人民的革命斗争。
    我们一定要同全世界革命人民一道，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    我们一定要更加努力地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想更广泛地传播到全世界。
    这是历史赋予我国人民的光荣使命，是我国人民应尽的国际主义义务。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席号召：“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”
    让我们为实现毛主席的这个伟大号召而英勇斗争吧！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    全世界无产者联合起来！
    全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！
    战无不胜的马克思主义、列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！
