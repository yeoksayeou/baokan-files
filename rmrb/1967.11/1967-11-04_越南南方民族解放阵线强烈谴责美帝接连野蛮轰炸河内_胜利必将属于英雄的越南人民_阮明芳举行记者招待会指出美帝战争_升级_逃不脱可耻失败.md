The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' continuous brutal bombing of Hanoi. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people.

Nguyen Minh Huong holds a press conference pointing out that the U.S. imperialists' war "escalation" cannot escape a shameful defeat.

Hanoi, November 3 (Xinhua) According to a report by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently issued a statement strongly condemning the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in sending planes to brutally bomb the city of Hanoi.

The statement, after listing the crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the people of Hanoi from October 24 to 28 and the recent dispatch of more troops to South Vietnam, pointed out: "These acts of war once again prove that U.S. imperialism is plotting to intensify and expand the war of aggression. The cunning words of peace and deception from the U.S. ruling clique cannot cover up their aggressive crimes against the independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese people."

The statement firmly demands that U.S. imperialism must unconditionally and permanently stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and all other acts of war, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam, and recognize the National Liberation Front as the sole legitimate representative of the people of South Vietnam.

The statement said that the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam, armed with revolutionary heroism, are determined to advance and decisively achieve greater victories in the winter and spring, to liberate the South and defend the North.

The statement sternly warns U.S. imperialism that if it continues stubbornly down the path of crime, it will only hasten its way to a more disastrous and shameful defeat.

The Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory. The U.S. imperialist aggressors and the traitorous clique will surely suffer a thorough defeat.

Hanoi, November 3 (Xinhua) Nguyen Minh Huong, deputy head of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, held a press conference this morning to introduce the situation of the second conference of model and heroic soldiers of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam, expressing the firm belief of the military and people of South Vietnam to carry on the spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, and to carry the anti-U.S. war of national salvation to the final victory.

Nguyen Minh Huong said that since the first conference of model and heroic soldiers of the armed forces of South Vietnam was held more than two years ago, the military and people of South Vietnam have undergone severe tests. U.S. imperialism has been beaten by the military and people of South Vietnam to the point of being at a loss and in a passive and helpless situation. He pointed out that the military and people of South Vietnam are firmly convinced that no matter what the situation is, no matter how many troops the enemy sends, the military and people of South Vietnam are fully capable of defeating U.S. imperialism, and victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people with revolutionary heroism.

Nguyen Minh Huong strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' continuous sending of bandit planes to brutally bomb Hanoi while shouting for "peace talks." He pointed out that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will surely not escape a shameful defeat.

    声明在列举了美帝国主义于十月二十四日到二十八日对河内市人民犯下的罪行以及最近又向越南南方增派军队的战争行动之后指出：“这些战争行动再一次证明，美帝国主义正在阴谋加强和扩大侵略战争。美国统治集团的狡诈和平言词，掩盖不了它破坏越南人民的独立主权的侵略罪行。”

    声明严厉警告美帝国主义，如果它继续顽固地沿着罪恶的道路走下去，就只能加速走向更为惨重和可耻的失败。
    越南人民必定取得最后胜利。美帝国主义侵略者和卖国走狗集团必定遭到彻底失败。

    阮明芳说，越南南方人民解放武装力量第一届英模大会召开两年多来，越南南方军民经受了严峻的考验，美帝国主义已经被越南南方军民打得走投无路，陷入一筹莫展的被动困境。他指出，越南南方军民坚信：不管在怎样的情况下，不管敌人怎样增兵，南方军民完全有可能打败美帝国主义，胜利必将属于富有革命英雄主义的越南人民。
    阮明芳强烈谴责美帝国主义接连派遣强盗飞机野蛮轰炸河内同时又叫嚷什么“和谈”的滔天罪行。他指出，美帝国主义及其走狗终将逃不脱可耻的失败。
