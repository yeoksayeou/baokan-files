300,000 troops from Hebei Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "definitely tame the Haihe River," are riding the mighty tide of the Cultural Revolution. They are full of spirit and fighting fervently to secure victory in the third battle to tame the Haihe River. This is one of the eight major projects to tame the Haihe River, the Huangbi Village Reservoir construction site. The workers are rushing to complete the construction. This year's progress and quality of the project have surpassed any year since the reservoir's construction began.
