On the eve of national victory, our great leader Chairman Mao, in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, set forth the basic guidelines for class struggle and economic construction after the proletariat seizes power. In this report, Chairman Mao analyzed the situation of various economic components in China at that time, clearly pointing out that capitalism must be restricted and socialism must be developed. He warned us: "Restriction and counter-restriction will be the main form of class struggle within the new democratic state. If we think that we do not need to restrict capitalism now, if we think that we can abandon the slogan of 'regulating capital,' this is completely wrong, this is the viewpoint of right opportunism." At that time, restricting capitalism was a special form of class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, relying on the strong dictatorship of the proletariat. Its purpose was to ultimately and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeoisie and capitalism.

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions pointed out the correct direction for the ship of New China. It was under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that our national economy was rapidly restored, and great achievements were made in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, with the socialist economic foundation continuously consolidated and developed.

Chinese Khrushchev, on the other hand, was determined to develop capitalism and establish bourgeois dictatorship. He openly opposed Chairman Mao, vigorously opposing the restriction of capitalism. In April 1949, just after the conclusion of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, he rushed to Tianjin—the largest industrial and commercial city in the liberated areas at that time—giving speeches and issuing directives everywhere, frantically advocating for the development of capitalism. In labor relations, public-private relations, and foreign trade, he proposed a whole set of black guidelines, performing a farce of currying favor with the bourgeoisie and developing capitalism.

Restricting the Bourgeoisie or Restricting the Proletariat?

In old China, the working class suffered from the oppression of imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and feudal forces, "the severity and cruelty of which were rarely seen among the peoples of the world." After the working class seized power, although private capitalism could not be immediately eliminated, it was absolutely necessary to ensure that the working class held political power and to immediately improve the working conditions of the workers appropriately, restricting the exploitation of capitalism. The broad masses of workers and revolutionary cadres were engaged in this struggle.

The heroic struggle of the working class shattered Chinese Khrushchev's beautiful dream of developing capitalism and establishing bourgeois dictatorship. Thus, this reactionary, who had always regarded the masses as "mob," immediately began to bully the workers upon his arrival, harshly criticizing them and shouting, "The workers have gone too far, they must be persuaded not to do this." What should be done then? He set the tone: "Basically, things should remain the same as before."

What a "basically, things should remain the same as before"! These eight words of confession already vividly depict the ugly face of this representative of the bourgeoisie. It turns out that Chinese Khrushchev's ultimate goal was not the liberation of the working class but, on the contrary, a historical regression, attempting to hand over the revolutionary achievements won by the Chinese people through decades of bloody struggle to the bourgeoisie, making the working class continue to suffer from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the bourgeoisie!

Let us look at a few blood-stained indictments to see what devilish schemes are hidden behind Chinese Khrushchev's words of "basically, things should remain the same as before"?

An investigation of 112 small factories in the textile and metal industries in Tianjin revealed that as late as the summer of 1951, nearly two-thirds of the factories required workers to work more than 13 hours a day, with 14 factories requiring workers to work more than 17 hours a day. Other factories required workers to work at least 12 hours a day. More than half of the workers had no holidays at all, and those who did have holidays were mostly given only one day off per month. Some capitalists even used tricks like moving the clock hands to extend the working hours of the workers.

Moreover, capitalists dared to continue beating and scolding workers in a feudal manner. In the investigation of 118 factories at that time, 30 factories' apprentice workers reflected that they had been beaten and scolded. For example, all the apprentice workers in the Rongchang Iron Works had been beaten.

Capitalists also used every means to obstruct workers from participating in political activities. In addition to extending working hours, they also used despicable methods such as dismissing workers, striking at activists, reducing wages, and threatening through intermediaries. The manager of the Ruchang Iron Works once gathered all the workers in the factory and openly threatened, "None of you should join the union. If you join the union, you won't make money every day. Besides, what will you do if the Kuomintang comes back?" Look, how enthusiastically the capitalists played under the black baton of Chinese Khrushchev's "basically, things should remain the same as before"!

It was not just that. Chinese Khrushchev even openly shouted that capitalists had the "right to dismiss workers" and incited capitalists to say, "You must fight with the workers." Under his direct orders, Tianjin even stipulated in writing that "the employer has the freedom to dismiss workers." With Chinese Khrushchev, this giant monster, backing them up, and with the legal stick of "freely dismissing workers," the capitalists' arrogance reached its peak. They dismissed a large number of workers and union cadres who dared to fight against them, and carried out brutal suppression of the workers. For example, in the struggle of the workers of Tianjin Shengxifu Hat Shop to restrict the capitalists from withdrawing funds in June 1949, which lasted for ten months, Chinese Khrushchev's agent in Tianjin parroted his master's tone and shouted, "The current situation in China is not that there is too much capital, but that there is too little capital," and absurdly said that the workers "supervised the production of the employers...reducing the employers' interest in management." Thus, the union chairman was transferred, and the capitalists were allowed to dismiss 16 female workers. It was only allowed for the capitalists to play tricks, but not for the workers to catch them!

Think about it: the above-mentioned bloody facts are so similar to the scene of British capitalists cruelly exploiting and oppressing the working class in the early 19th century as described by Marx! What Chinese Khrushchev meant by "basically, things should remain the same as before" was to establish bourgeois dictatorship in China, wasn't it?

However, the ant's arms can never block the wheel of history. "To establish a capitalist society with bourgeois dictatorship after the victory of anti-imperialist and anti-feudalism in China is indeed a complete delusion!" Just so! Looking back at Chinese Khrushchev's arrogant posture of barking "basically, things should remain the same as before" at that time, it was nothing more than the performance of a fool blinded by greed.

Restricting Capitalism or Restricting Socialism?

The relationship between the state, state-owned economy, and capitalist industry and commerce, that is, the so-called "public-private relationship," is an important aspect of the struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie in restricting and counter-restricting. At the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, our great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The existence and development of Chinese capitalism are not like those in capitalist countries, unrestricted and allowed to spread. It will be restricted in several aspects—in the scope of activities, in tax policies, in market prices, and in labor conditions." He also taught us that "state-owned economy should become the leading component of the entire national economy." These wise instructions, like a lighthouse with beams of light, guided us in correctly handling this public-private relationship and achieving continuous victories in the struggle against the bourgeoisie.

However, Chinese Khrushchev jumped out and sang the opposite tune. After arriving in Tianjin, he racked his brains to put makeup on the capitalists, shouting hoarsely to peddle the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation is progressive," and passionately advocating "not to restrict capitalists from making too much money." He also openly advocated the development of capitalism under the pretext of developing production. He said: "Perhaps in the future, private production will exceed public production, but the government is not afraid. Our main goal is to develop production and we do not oppose the development of production." At that time, the bureaucratic capital we confiscated accounted for about 80% of the entire capitalist production in old China. Under the condition that the state-owned economy had an absolute advantage, Chinese Khrushchev actually imagined that "in the future, private production will exceed public production." Wasn't this to restrict state-owned production and vigorously develop capitalism to the point of flooding? Wasn't this to insist on taking the capitalist road with a heart of madness?

The state's strong management of raw material supply is an important measure to prevent the free spread of urban and rural capitalism, but Chinese Khrushchev viciously said: the state trade company "monopolizes raw materials and the market," which is "only for itself, that is wrong, that is against the party's policy." He ordered "public and private enterprises to combine into a single economic system," to "from raw materials to the market, jointly discuss and allocate with state-owned and private enterprises, this is called 'everyone eats, everyone makes money'." He also bowed and scraped to promise the capitalists: "You have some difficulties, such as raw materials, you can declare to the government, and the government will help as much as possible."

Under the pressure of Chinese Khrushchev's "joint discussion" and "as much help as possible," the Tianjin State-owned Cotton and Textile Company not only continuously supplied a large amount of cotton to various private textile mills but also gave special preferential treatment in the cotton exchange rate. At that time, for state-owned yarn mills, one piece of yarn exchanged 610 jin of cotton, while for private yarn mills with basically the same equipment, one piece of yarn exchanged 625 jin of cotton. Just this item alone, the capitalists made a huge profit. For example, the Hengyuan Textile Mill made an additional 20,000 jin of cotton per month because of this.

Even more despicable was that for every 20-count cotton yarn, it could produce 41.5 pieces of Red Star cloth, but the State-owned Cotton and Textile Company, under the pressure of Chinese Khrushchev's emphasis on "as much help as possible" and "joint discussion," in the whole year from spring 1949 to spring 1950, stipulated that every 20-count cotton yarn could only exchange 27 pieces of Red Star cloth. According to the incomplete statistics of eight months, the capitalists thus handed over about 90,000 pieces of cloth less to the state. The state was cheated, and the capitalists were fattened—this was Chinese Khrushchev's "as much help as possible"!

Many other industries were the same. For example, the Egg Product Company, to solve the difficulties of raw materials and sales channels for private factories, let private factories process for the state, and the result of "joint discussion" was to guarantee private factories a net profit of 16.18%.

The state bank is an important lever for promoting the development of state-owned economy and restricting the free spread of capitalism, but Chinese Khrushchev was madly trying to turn it into a pillar for developing capitalism. In 1949, he incited capitalists in Tianjin: "Loans should also be discussed together," and "everyone should get a share." The capitalists, who were only interested in profit, immediately understood and pretended to be in difficulty, asking the state for money, shamelessly shouting that "public should come before private." Under the orders of Chinese Khrushchev, state loans were mainly directed towards capitalists:

By the end of May 1949, private industry accounted for 58.6% of the industrial loans from the People's Bank. By 1950, loans to private industry and commerce increased significantly, with the loan balance reaching 307 billion yuan (old currency, equivalent to 307 million yuan in current currency) by the end of March, and surging to 1,552 billion yuan by the end of October. According to statistics from June 1950, loans from the state bank to private enterprises reached as high as 85.57%.

The struggle over market prices is an important aspect of the struggle between restricting and counter-restricting. At that time, capitalists took advantage of the fact that the War of Liberation was still ongoing, production had not yet fully recovered, and the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure were not yet balanced, constantly stirring up trouble, driving up prices, and making huge profits. Chinese Khrushchev turned a blind eye to this and shamelessly shouted: "Capitalists making money is legal, no matter how much they make, colorful and fancy, rouge and powder, feasting and drinking are all legal." This copper-smelling black talk concentratedly reflected the greedy and extravagant psychology of those greedy and extravagant capitalists. They were overjoyed, saying that from now on "capitalists need not be afraid." Thus, from April 1949 to the end of the year, they created three waves of price increases in the market. These people made huge profits from this harmful and evil activity. For example, the general manager of Tianjin Zhenye Asbestos Company, under the name of "joint operation," monopolized the asbestos market, raised prices, and embezzled state assets totaling 100 billion yuan from 1949 to 1951.

In early 1950, the unified management and leadership of national financial and economic work were realized, stabilizing prices and providing favorable conditions for further restricting and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. The capitalists, who were accustomed to speculation, felt at a loss and cried out in difficulty. Chinese Khrushchev immediately stepped forward, loudly calling out: "The people's government should provide them with various necessary convenient conditions," "help them succeed in their business." Attempting to make our society return to a world of free capitalism.

Under the black directive of Chinese Khrushchev, when goods were stagnant in May and June 1950 in Tianjin, to help capitalists "succeed," despite the accumulation of state-owned commercial inventory and sales difficulties, and despite the state's heavy losses, they still purchased a large number of goods hoarded by capitalists for speculation and products produced blindly. For example, the Tianjin Trust Company and the Department Store purchased 2,500 bags of soda, losing more than 8 billion yuan. The Department Store purchased fertilizer from Yongli Chemical Company at a high price, losing more than 70 billion yuan. According to statistics from six companies in Tianjin, including the State-owned Trust, Department Store, Egg Product, Grain, Petroleum, and Oil, from January to August 1950, the total value of purchases in more than ten industries, including textiles, knitting, chemicals, and rubber products, private enterprises accounted for 76%. Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "the people's government should provide capitalists with various necessary convenient conditions" was actually to make socialist commerce serve the development of capitalism.

Even worse, at that time, the state-owned Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company used waste materials to create matchbox paper, which was of high quality and low price, and was very popular in the market. Private paper mills immediately held a meeting of the industry, complaining and coercing the state-owned paper mill to help solve their "difficulties." As a result, the Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company was forced to stop this production and hand it over to private paper mills to produce, and raised the original selling price to ensure the profits of private paper mills. This was an example of implementing Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "our party, government, trade bureau, and state-owned factories must actively unite with capitalists and actively cooperate with them"!

Capitalists are personified capital, and their ultimate pursuit is profit. Under Chinese Khrushchev's "as much help as possible," in 1949, the rate of return on capital for private industry in Tianjin was more than double that of local state-owned industry, and in 1950, the rate of return on capital for private industry increased by another 29.12%, with the total profit amounting to more than four times that of 1949. What kind of goods was the "mutual benefit" advocated by Chinese Khrushchev? Isn't it clear now?

Taxation is another important weapon to restrict the free spread of capitalism. To grab huge profits, capitalists would naturally do everything possible to sabotage our tax policies. From 1949 to 1951, they evaded taxes amounting to more than 800 billion yuan. In addition, they were very good at "legal" struggle. When Chinese Khrushchev came to Tianjin to support the capitalists, the greedy capitalists competed to "complain" and demand tax reductions. Chinese Khrushchev nodded in agreement. On the one hand, he shamelessly distorted the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, turning the state's taxation of capitalists (which in essence is the state reclaiming part of the surplus value that capitalists have exploited back into the state) into a vicious slander of "the state exploiting you (referring to capitalists)"; on the other hand, he issued a black directive in front of the capitalists: "If the tax is too heavy, it can be modified to be more reasonable," "how to modify, please give your opinions, propose a new tax rate table." Under the pressure of Chinese Khrushchev, Tianjin established a "Tax Review Committee" and a "Price Review Committee" dominated by capitalists to review and audit disputes over taxation, fines, and other issues in capitalist industry and commerce, giving capitalists the "legal" right to attack socialist taxation. According to statistics, the production of Tianjin's capitalist industry in 1951 increased by 46.3% compared to 1950, growing faster than the same period of socialist industry production, but state taxation actually decreased by 0.2% compared to 1950. More seriously, according to the reactionary line of restricting socialism and developing capitalism advocated by Chinese Khrushchev, the principle of "equal taxation for public and private" was adopted, openly destroying the principle of differentiated taxation for public and private, thus fundamentally strangling the role of taxation in restricting the free spread of capitalism.

Control Foreign Trade or Act as the Chief Agent?

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out at the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee: "The recovery and development of the national economy of the People's Republic cannot be achieved without a policy of controlling foreign trade." "The restriction of capital at home and the control of trade abroad are the two basic policies of this country in economic struggle." He also emphasized that once we enter large cities, we must "immediately control foreign trade and reform the customs system." Without implementing the control of foreign trade, the door is wide open, allowing private merchants to collude with imperialism, which not only cannot guarantee that our country will take the socialist road but will inevitably regress to the old road of semi-colonialism.

However, Chinese Khrushchev, who wanted to be a "red" comprador, once again jumped out to oppose Chairman Mao on this crucial issue. This chief comprador, who came to Tianjin in April 1949, immediately began to lecture our party with a stern face: the control of foreign trade "should be relaxed, not too strict," and he ordered to "absorb capitalists to participate in the 'Foreign Trade Commission,'" advocating that private merchants "do business with imperialists and foreigners if it is beneficial." Under his indulgence and incitement, by July 1949, private foreign trade merchants in Tianjin had increased threefold in just two or three months, reaching 340. By the end of the year, private merchants and foreign merchants had increased to 556, plus the branch offices of private import and export merchants in the East China region stationed in Tianjin, totaling 717. This was the so-called "Tianjin's foreign trade has achieved unprecedented prosperity." In 1949, private merchants accounted for 66.6% of the total import value in Tianjin and 77.7% of the total export value. These shocking figures show that it was not the state but the capitalists who basically monopolized the foreign trade of Tianjin.

So, what were the "benefits" of private merchants "doing business with imperialists"? Let the facts speak for themselves.

First of all, it made it easy for capitalists to make huge "legal" profits. Under the policy of "as much help as possible" of this chief comprador, the profits of foreign trade merchants were guaranteed to be maintained at more than 10% during the import and export pricing. According to investigations, from April to the first half of May 1950, four companies—Jiancheng, Hengtong, Yiji, and Xinglong—made a total profit of more than 22 billion yuan. Among them, Hengtong Company, after Chinese Khrushchev's visit to Tianjin a year later, had its business capacity expanded by three times compared to before liberation.

Secondly, some merchants used "legal" operations as a cover to engage in various evil activities. For example, Tianjin Xingdong Company illegally bought 758 taels of gold, using more than 300 taels for black market speculation and smuggling of prohibited items, and the rest were all smuggled out of the country. Tianjing Trade Company illegally exported a large number of domestic urgently needed kaolin, embezzling state assets totaling 8 billion yuan.

As for the reactionary capitalist Song Qiying, who was praised to the skies by Chinese Khrushchev, he did even better. He lied about buying machines and asked the state for 190,000 US dollars in foreign exchange, and Chinese Khrushchev nodded in agreement. As a result, he took this huge sum of money and all his assets and betrayed the country to the enemy.

Under the policy of "as much help as possible" of Chinese Khrushchev, foreign trade merchants, taking the state as a fool, colluded with each other, asking for more and more, using the method of sending in and pulling out to conspire to seize the loan leadership of the Bank of China in Tianjin. As a result, the Bank of China in Tianjin lent more than 90% of its foreign trade loans to private import and export merchants and significantly reduced the interest rates. Foreign trade merchants used despicable means to cheat foreign trade loans. For example, Tianjin Jufenghua Trading Company, an import and export merchant, used six stinking ditches inside the company as collateral to cheat a huge loan.

All of these indeed benefited the comprador capitalists, merchants, swindlers, and imperialists, but at the same time, they seriously harmed socialism and the young proletarian state. This was the class essence of the "benefits" pursued by Chinese Khrushchev!

To cover up his traitorous face, to open the door of the state's foreign trade to capitalists, Chinese Khrushchev also solemnly said: capitalists "doing business with imperialists and foreigners," "this is doing business, politics is another matter."

This is a shameless lie!

In a class society, there has never been a purely "business" that does not belong to a certain politics, and foreign trade is no exception. Allowing capitalists to establish foreign trade relations with imperialism is not a non-political issue of "not losing sovereignty," but precisely a political issue of currying favor with the enemy and selling out the country. Isn't allowing capitalists to collude with imperialism and jointly launch a fierce attack on socialist economy and the state of proletarian dictatorship still a political issue?

Economics is the foundation, and politics is the concentrated expression of economics. The rampant spread of capitalist economy and the degeneration of the socialist economic foundation will inevitably lead to bourgeois dictatorship. Therefore, in the special historical conditions of the early days of liberation, the struggle between restricting and counter-restricting is essentially a struggle between two political lines, two roads, and two destinies of China. From the farce performed by Chinese Khrushchev during his visit to Tianjin, and from the harm he brought to the work in Tianjin after liberation, we have a deeper understanding of this.

The above historical iron-clad evidence from several aspects indisputably shows: Chinese Khrushchev did not restrict the bourgeoisie but restricted the proletariat; he did not restrict private enterprises but restricted state-owned enterprises; he did not control foreign trade but wanted to act as the chief comprador. In a word, Chinese Khrushchev wanted to develop capitalism, establish bourgeois dictatorship, and oppose proletarian dictatorship. He has been hating socialism with gritted teeth for decades and has been madly in love with capitalism. Stripping off the disguise, standing there is such a great traitor!

Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to turn Tianjin into an experimental field for establishing bourgeois dictatorship was frustrated due to the resolute resistance and opposition of the working class and the broad revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Especially in 1952, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao launched the great "Five Antis" campaign, giving those big belly merchants who were celebrating the "golden age" a hard blow, bringing a more vigorous new look to Tianjin, and making the socialist economic foundation more consolidated and developed.

    工贼的表演和海河的见证
    ——斥中国赫鲁晓夫解放初期在天津发展资本主义、打击社会主义的罪行
    天津大学《八·一三》杂志编辑部
    全国胜利前夕，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议的报告中，规定了无产阶级夺取政权后，进行阶级斗争和经济建设的基本方针。毛主席在这个报告中着重分析了当时中国各种经济成份的状况，明确指出，要限制资本主义，发展社会主义。他告诫我们：“限制和反限制，将是新民主主义国家内部阶级斗争的主要形式。如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。”当时，限制资本主义是无产阶级依靠强大的无产阶级专政，同资产阶级进行阶级斗争的一种特殊形式，它的目的是为了最后彻底消灭资产阶级和资本主义。
    毛主席的光辉指示，指明了新中国这条航船的正确航向。正是在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，我国国民经济迅速恢复，社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得了伟大的成就，社会主义经济基础不断地得到巩固和发展。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一心发展资本主义，建立资产阶级专政。他公然同毛主席大唱反调，拚命地反对限制资本主义。一九四九年四月，党的七届二中全会刚刚结束，他就急不可待地跑到天津——当时解放区最大的工商业城市，到处作报告，发指示，猖狂地为发展资本主义奔走呼号。他在劳资关系、公私关系和对外贸易等方面，提出了一整套黑纲领，表演了一场投靠资产阶级，发展资本主义的活丑剧。
    限制资产阶级，还是限制无产阶级
    在旧中国，工人阶级身受帝国主义、资产阶级和封建势力三种压迫，“这些压迫的严重性和残酷性，是世界各民族中少见的”。工人阶级夺取政权后，尽管私人资本主义还不能够马上消灭，但是，确保工人阶级在政治上当家作主的地位，并立即适当地改善工人的劳动条件，限制资本主义的剥削，则是完全必要的。广大工人群众和革命干部正是这样进行斗争的。
    工人阶级的英勇斗争，打破了中国赫鲁晓夫发展资本主义、建立资产阶级专政的黄粱美梦。于是，这个一向把群众看作“群氓”的反动家伙，下车伊始，就对工人群众大发淫威，横加指责，大叫工人群众“左”了，“必须说服工人不能这样做”。那么，究竟应该怎样做呢？他定下了基调：“基本上照过去一样”。
    好一个“基本上照过去一样”！这八个字的自供，就已经维妙维肖地勾划出他这个资产阶级总代理人的丑恶嘴脸。原来，中国赫鲁晓夫追求的根本不是什么工人阶级的解放，恰恰相反，他要的是实行历史的大倒退，妄图把中国人民几十年浴血奋战换来的革命成果拱手交给资产阶级，要工人阶级“照过去一样”地继续受资产阶级的残酷压迫和剥削！
    让我们从几份血迹斑斑的控诉书中，看一下中国赫鲁晓夫“基本上照过去一样”的这句混账话，究竟包藏着什么鬼主意？
    天津市纺织、五金等行业一百一十二家小型工厂的调查表明：一直到一九五一年夏，将近三分之二的工厂，工人要劳动十三小时以上，其中劳动十七小时以上的达十四家。其他各厂工人至少也要劳动十二小时。工人平时根本没有假期的占总数的一半以上，其他虽有假期，但大多每月只放假一天。有些资本家，还用偷拨钟表的伎俩延长工人劳动时间。
    不仅如此，资本家竟敢对工人继续进行封建性的打骂。在当时调查的一百一十八家工厂中，有三十家工厂的工人学徒反映了挨打挨骂的遭遇。例如荣昌铁工厂所有的学徒工，没有未挨过打的。
    资本家更千方百计地猖狂阻挠工人参加政治活动。为此，他们除了靠延长劳动时间以外，还玩弄解雇、打击积极分子、降低工资以及通过介绍人进行威胁等等卑劣手法。瑞昌铁工厂经理就曾把全厂工人召集起来，公然威胁说：“你们都不要参加工会，入了工会每天开会就赚不了钱了，再说你们参加工会后，国民党来了怎么办？”看，在中国赫鲁晓夫“照过去一样”的黑指挥棒下，资本家演奏得何等起劲！
    岂止如此而已，中国赫鲁晓夫还公然叫嚷资本家有“辞退工人的权力”，并煽动资本家说：“你们必须要和工人斗争”。就在他的直接指使下，天津市竟明文规定“资方解雇工人是自由的”。资本家有了中国赫鲁晓夫这个庞然大物为他们撑腰壮胆，又有“合法”解雇工人的大棒，气焰嚣张达于极点，解雇了大批敢于和他们斗争的工人和工会干部，对工人实行残酷镇压。例如，一九四九年六月发生的天津盛锡福帽庄工人限制资本家抽逃资金的斗争，坚持了十个月之久，中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的代理人，鹦鹉学舌地用其主子的腔调叫嚷“当前中国的情况不是资本太多，而是资本太少”，胡说工人“督促资方生产……使资方经营的兴趣减弱下来”。于是将工会主任调离，并纵容资本家解雇十六名女工。真是只许资本家捣鬼，不许工人捉鬼！
    请大家想一想：上述一些血淋淋的事实，和马克思所描述的十九世纪初叶英国资本家残酷剥削压迫工人群众的景象何等相似！中国赫鲁晓夫所谓的“照过去一样”，不是要在中国实现资产阶级专政又是什么？
    然而，螳臂毕竟挡不住历史的巨轮，“要在中国反帝反封建胜利之后，再建立资产阶级专政的资本主义社会，岂非是完全的梦呓？”正是这样！回头看看中国赫鲁晓夫当年飞扬跋扈地吠叫“照过去一样”的神态，只不过是一个利令智昏的小丑的表演而已。
    限制资本主义，还是限制社会主义
    国家、国营经济同资本主义工商业之间的关系，即所谓“公私关系”，是工人阶级同资产阶级之间限制和反限制斗争的一个重要的方面。在党的七届二中全会上，我们伟大领袖毛主席就明确提出：“中国资本主义的存在和发展，不是如同资本主义国家那样不受限制任其泛滥的。它将从几个方面被限制——在活动范围方面，在税收政策方面，在市场价格方面，在劳动条件方面。”并且教导我们要“使国营经济成为整个国民经济的领导成份”。这些英明指示，如同光芒万丈的灯塔，指引着我们正确处理这种公私关系，在同资产阶级进行斗争中不断胜利前进。
    然而，中国赫鲁晓夫却公然跳出来大唱反调。他到天津后挖空心思地为资本家浓施粉黛，声嘶力竭地叫卖资本家“剥削有功”、“剥削进步”的反动谬论，狂热地鼓吹“不要限制资本家赚钱太多”，并且借口发展生产而明目张胆地主张发展资本主义。他说：“也许将来私营生产会超过公营的，但政府并不怕，我们的主要目的是在发展生产，并不反对那样生产发展得多。”当时，被我们没收的官僚资本，占旧中国整个资本主义生产的百分之八十左右，就在这种国营经济占有绝对优势的条件下，中国赫鲁晓夫竟然设想“将来私营生产会超过公营的”，这不是要拚命限制国营生产，极力发展资本主义使其泛滥成灾又是什么？！这不是丧心病狂地坚持走资本主义道路又是什么？！
    国家对原料供应进行强有力的管理，是防止城乡资本主义自由泛滥的重要措施，但中国赫鲁晓夫却恶狠狠地说：国家贸易公司“统治原料、市场”，是“只顾到自己，那就是不对的，是违反党的政策的。”他下令“公私企业要结合起来成为一个整个的经济体系”，要“从原料到市场，由国营私营共同商量，共同分配，这叫做‘有饭大家吃，有钱大家赚’”。他还卑躬屈膝地向资本家许愿：“你们有些困难，象是原料等问题，可以向政府声明，政府能办到的，一定尽量帮助。”
    就在中国赫鲁晓夫的“共同商量”、“尽量帮助”的压力下，天津国营花纱布公司不仅源源不断地向各私营纺织厂大量供应棉花，并且在换棉率上给予特殊优待。当时，对国营纱厂一件纱换棉六百一十斤，而对设备条件基本一致的私营纱厂，一件纱却换棉六百二十五斤。仅此一项，资本家就不知牟取了多少暴利。例如，恒源纺织厂就因此每月多赚约两万斤棉花。
    更可恶的是，每件二十支棉纱，本可生产红星布四十一匹多，但国营花纱布公司委托私营织染业加工时，迫于中国赫鲁晓夫强调“尽量帮助”和“共同商量”的压力，在一九四九年春至一九五○年春的整整一年中，却规定每件二十支棉纱只换回红星布二十七匹。仅据其中八个月的不完全统计，资本家因此就少交给国家约九万匹布。亏了国家，养肥了资本家——这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的“尽量帮助”！
    其他许多行业也是这样。例如，蛋品公司为了解决私厂原料和销路的困难，就让私厂为国家加工，“共同商量”的结果，竟保证私厂净得百分之十六点一八的高额利润。
    国家银行是扶植国营经济发展、限制资本主义自由泛滥的重要杠杆，但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却丧心病狂地要把它篡改成发展资本主义的支柱。一九四九年他在天津鼓动资本家说：“贷款方面也要互相商量”，要“大家分一点”。唯利是图的资本家心领神会，纷纷伪装困难，向国家伸手要钱，肆无忌惮地嚎叫什么“不能先公后私”。就在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，国家贷款竟主要面向了资本家：
    一九四九年五月底，人民银行的工业贷款中，私营工业就占百分之五十八点六。到一九五○年，更大大增加了对私营工商业的贷款，贷款余额一九五○年三月底为三百零七亿元（旧人民币，折合现人民币为三百零七万元，下同），十月底猛增为一千五百五十二亿元。据一九五○年六月份统计，国家银行贷款中，私营企业贷款竟高达百分之八十五点五七。
    市场价格的斗争，是限制和反限制斗争的一个重要侧面。当时，资本家利用解放战争还在进行，生产还没有完全恢复，国家财政收支尚未平衡，便不断兴风作浪，哄抬物价，牟取暴利。中国赫鲁晓夫对此讳莫如深，并且无耻地大肆叫嚷：资本家“赚多少钱都是合法的，多到什么程度，花花绿绿，胭脂水粉，大吃大喝都是合法的。”这番铜臭熏天的黑话，集中地反映了那些贪婪无厌、挥霍无度的大腹贾们的利欲心理。他们喜出望外地说，从此“资本家不用害怕了”。于是，只从一九四九年四月到年底，就接连三次制造市场物价涨风。这帮家伙从这种危害国计民生的罪恶活动中，大发横财。例如天津振业石棉公司总经理以“联营”为名，垄断石棉市场，高抬价格，一九四九年至一九五一年三年中，就窃取了国家资财达百亿元。
    一九五○年初，实现了全国财政经济工作的统一管理和统一领导，稳定了物价，为进一步限制和改造资本主义工商业提供了有利条件。投机成性的资本家，感到走投无路，大喊困难。中国赫鲁晓夫又立即挺身而出，大声疾呼：“人民政府应当给予他们以各项必要的便利条件”，“帮助其事业的成功”。妄图使我国社会重新成为资本主义自由泛滥的天地。
    就在中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示下，当一九五○年五、六月份货物滞销时期，在天津市，为了帮助资本家“成功”，不顾国营商业库存积压和销售困难，不顾国家亏损累累，仍大量收购资本家投机囤积的货物和盲目生产的产品。例如，天津市信托公司与百货公司，收购碱面二千五百包，赔本八亿多元。百货公司高价收购永利化学公司的肥田粉，赔本七十多亿元。根据天津市国营信托、百货、蛋品、粮食、石油、油脂六个公司的统计，一九五○年一至八月份对纱布、针织、化工、橡胶制品等十多个行业的收购总值中，私营竟占百分之七十六。中国赫鲁晓夫所谓人民政府应当给予资本家以各项必要的便利条件，实际上就是要使社会主义商业为发展资本主义服务。
    尤有甚者，当时国营天津纸浆造纸公司，利用废料创制火柴纸，质优价廉，大受市场欢迎。私营纸厂立即召开同业座谈会，纷纷“诉苦”，胁迫国营纸厂帮助解决其“困难”。结果，天津纸浆造纸公司竟被迫停止此项生产，让给私营纸厂制造，并将原售价提高，以保证私营纸厂的利润。这就是实行中国赫鲁晓夫所谓的“我们的党、政府、贸易局、公营工厂，必须主动的联合资本家，主动的和他们合作”的一个“范例”！
    资本家就是人格化的资本，他们一心追求的就是利润。在中国赫鲁晓夫的“尽量帮助”下，一九四九年天津市私营工业的资金利润率竟比地方国营工业的高出一倍以上，而一九五○年私营工业的资金利润率又进一步提高了百分之二十九点一二，利润总额更比一九四九年猛增四倍以上。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“公私两利”到底是什么货色，难道还不清楚吗？
    税收是限制资本主义自由泛滥的另一重要武器。资本家为了捞取暴利，必然千方百计地破坏我们的税收政策。从一九四九年到一九五一年的三年间，他们偷税漏税竟达八千多亿元。此外，他们还很会进行“合法”的斗争。当中国赫鲁晓夫到天津为资本家撑腰打气时，利欲熏心的资本家，争相“诉苦”，要求减税。中国赫鲁晓夫连连点头。他一则无耻地歪曲马列主义的根本原理，把国家向资本家征税（它实质上是国家把资本家剥削的剩余价值的一部分重新收回到国家手中），竟恶毒污蔑为“国家剥削你们（指资本家）了”；二则当着资本家的面发出黑指示：“税收重了，可以修改得合理一些”，“怎么修改，请你们提意见，提议个新的税率表”。就在中国赫鲁晓夫的压力下，天津市成立了以资本家为主的“税收复议委员会”、“货价评议委员会”，复核审查资本主义工商业的征税、罚款等争议问题，使资本家取得向社会主义税收进攻的“合法”权利。据统计，天津资本主义工业生产一九五一年比一九五○年猛增百分之四十六点三，比同期社会主义工业生产增长得还快，但国家税收却反而比一九五○年下降了百分之零点二。更为严重的是，根据中国赫鲁晓夫的限制社会主义、发展资本主义的反动路线，竟采取了所谓“公私一律平等纳税”的原则，公然破坏了公私区别对待的税收原则，这就从根本上扼杀了税收的限制资本主义自由泛滥的作用。
    统制对外贸易，还是充当头号买办
    毛主席在党的七届二中全会上明确指出：“人民共和国的国民经济的恢复和发展，没有对外贸易的统制政策是不可能的。”“对内的节制资本和对外的统制贸易，是这个国家在经济斗争中的两个基本政策。”并且强调指出我们一旦进入大城市，就必须“立即统制对外贸易，改革海关制度”。不实行对外的统制贸易，门户洞开，让私商同帝国主义勾结起来，就不但不能保证我国走向社会主义道路，反而势必倒退到半殖民地的老路上去。
    然而，一心想当“红色”买办的中国赫鲁晓夫，在这样一个要害问题上又一次跳出来同毛主席大唱反调。这个头号买办，一九四九年四月来到天津，就板着面孔教训我们党：对外贸易的管制，“应放宽些，不应管得太死”，他还下令要“吸收资本家参加”“对外贸易委员会”，鼓吹私商“和帝国主义来往，和外国人做生意有好处就做”。就在他的纵容和鼓动下，到一九四九年七月，私营外贸商户在短短两三个月内，就剧增三倍，达到三百四十家之多。及至年底，私商及洋商更剧增为五百五十六家，加之华东区私营进出口商驻津分支机构，共达七百一十七家之多。这就是当时大吹大擂的所谓“形成了天津对外贸易空前繁荣的状态”。一九四九年全年，私商在天津市进口总值中就占百分之六十六点六，而在出口总值中竟占百分之七十七点七。这些触目惊心的数字，说明了不是国家而是资本家，基本上垄断着天津市的对外贸易。
    那么，私商“和帝国主义来往”，究竟有些什么“好处”呢？还是让事实来说话吧。
    首先是使资本家轻而易举地赚得了巨额“合法”利润。在这个头号买办的“尽量帮助”方针下，在进出口划价时，保证外贸商的利润维持在百分之十以上。据调查，仅一九五○年四月到五月上半月期间，建成公司、亨通公司、义记商行、兴隆商行四家就获纯利二十二亿元以上。其中亨通公司，在中国赫鲁晓夫天津之行一年后，经营能力较解放前扩大了三倍。
    再者，某些奸商还以“合法”经营为幌子，进行种种罪恶活动。例如，天津醒东公司非法私买黄金七百五十八两，其中三百多两用于黑市投机和贩卖禁品，其余则全部走私出口。天兴贸易行则非法出口国内急需的大批粘土，盗窃国家资财达八亿元。
    至于被中国赫鲁晓夫吹捧上天的反动资本家宋棐卿，就作得更绝了。他谎言要买机器，伸手向国家索要十九万美元外汇，中国赫鲁晓夫点头应允。结果，他却携带这笔巨款及全部资金，叛国投敌去了。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫“尽量帮助”的方针下，外贸奸商们以国家为可欺，他们串通一气，得寸进尺，用派进来、拉出去的办法，阴谋篡夺天津中国银行的贷款领导权。结果，天津中国银行把百分之九十以上的外贸贷款都贷给了私营进出口商，并将利息大大降低。外贸奸商纷纷用卑鄙手段，骗取外贸贷款。例如，天津聚丰华行进出口商竟以该行内六条臭水沟冒充洗棉池作为押品，骗得巨额贷款。
    所有这些，的确使买办资本家、奸商、骗子手，还有帝国主义，都大大地得到了好处，但同时就严重地损害着社会主义和年青的无产阶级国家。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫所追求的“好处”的阶级实质！
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了掩盖自己卖国贼的反动嘴脸，为了把国家对外贸易的大门向资本家全部敞开，还煞有介事地说：资本家“和帝国主义来往，和外国人做生意”，“这是讲生意，政治问题是另外一回事”。
    这真是无耻的谎言！
    在阶级社会中，从来就没有不属于一定政治的单纯的“生意”，对外贸易岂能例外？放手让资本家和帝国主义建立外贸关系，决不是什么“不丧失主权”的非政治问题，而恰恰是媚敌卖国的政治。难道让资本家和帝国主义相互勾结起来，共同向社会主义经济、向无产阶级专政的国家猖狂进攻，还不是政治问题？
                      ×　×　×
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教导我们：经济是基础，政治是经济的集中表现。资本主义经济的泛滥，社会主义经济基础的蜕变，势必导致资产阶级专政。因而，在解放初期这个特定的历史条件下，限制和反限制的斗争，实质上是两条政治路线的斗争，两条道路的斗争，两个中国命运的斗争。从中国赫鲁晓夫天津之行所表演的这出活丑剧上，从他给解放后天津工作带来的危害上，我们更深刻地认识到这一点。
    以上几个方面的历史的铁证无可置辩地表明：中国赫鲁晓夫不去限制资产阶级，而是限制无产阶级；不去限制私营企业，而是限制国营企业；不去统制对外贸易，而要充当头号买办。一言以蔽之，中国赫鲁晓夫就是要发展资本主义，搞资产阶级专政，反对无产阶级专政。他几十年如一日地对社会主义咬牙切齿的仇恨，对资本主义如痴似醉的狂恋。剥开伪装的画皮，站着的就是这么一个大工贼，大叛徒！
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把天津变成他建立资产阶级专政试验场的阴谋，由于用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级和广大革命干部的坚决抵制和反对，终于遭到可耻的破产。特别是一九五二年，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发动了伟大的“五反”运动，将那些大放五毒，庆幸“黄金时代”的大腹贾们，打了个焦头烂额，给天津带来了更加蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，社会主义经济基础更加巩固，更加发展。
