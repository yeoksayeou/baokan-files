One day, a reporter came to our Hongqi District Scales Factory for an interview. I led him into the half-room office of the Revolutionary Committee. As soon as he lifted his foot to step over the threshold, he gave a "thud" and hit his head on the door frame. I couldn't help but complain in my heart: this half-room, low, dilapidated house is also called an office? The Revolutionary Committee of more than ten people can't even fit in here to discuss matters. No matter what, we have to change the office. After sending off the reporter, I hurried to discuss with Yang Lianying, the main leader of the Revolutionary Committee who came from the worker class.

Old Yang was helping the workshop unload aluminum blocks into the shed. I said to Old Yang, "Vacate two rooms from the original party branch's rooms to use as offices..." Old Yang said, "Right, you go and vacate the room, move in right away!" Hey, this time it was really straightforward!

The room was cleaned up, and Old Yang came in to look around with satisfaction, then said to the people outside, "Move in!" At this moment, I realized that there were two cars full of aluminum blocks parked outside. I was instantly stunned. Storing these raw materials, this still looks like an office?! I was very dissatisfied with Old Yang's approach. I just called out "Old Yang," and Old Yang took out the shiny red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his pocket and read, "To make our country prosperous and strong, we need several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposition to waste in building our country frugally." After reading, Old Yang affectionately said, "Small Rong, hard struggle is the fundamental way for us to keep our revolutionary youth. We proletarian revolutionaries have taken power, shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production. If we want to sit in spacious offices, show off, and detach ourselves from the masses, in my opinion, this is like a drop of seawater splashing onto the shore, which will dry up in no time." He pointed to the aluminum blocks on the car and said, "This is state property, and we must take good care of it."

After hearing Old Yang's words, I immediately rolled up my sleeves and helped Old Yang and the comrades unload the car.

    半间屋的办公室
    一天，一位记者来我们红旗区衡器厂采访，我把他让进革命委员会半间屋的办公室里。他刚一抬脚迈进门坎，就“咚”的一声，头碰到门框上了。我心里不禁埋怨起来：半间矮矮的破屋也叫办公室？革委会十来个人研究个事，都容不下。说什么也得换个办公室。等送走了记者，我急忙去找工人出身的革命委员会主要负责人杨连营商量。
    老杨正在帮着车间把铝块卸到席棚里。我对老杨说：“把原党支部那几间房子腾出两间来作办公室，……”老杨说：“对，你快去腾房，马上搬！”咦，这次真痛快！
    房子打扫干净了，老杨进来满意地打量了一番，然后向屋外的人说：“搬进来吧！”这时，我才发现门外停着两车铝块，我顿时呆住了。存上这些原料，这还象办公室！？我对老杨这种做法很不满意，刚叫了声老杨，老杨便从口袋里掏出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》读道：“要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”读完，老杨亲切地说：“小王，艰苦奋斗，是我们永葆革命青春的根本，咱们无产阶级革命派掌了权，肩挑革命、生产两副重担，如果想要坐宽敞的办公室，摆摆阔气，脱离了群众，依我看，这就象一滴海水，溅到海岸上，不用多久就会干了。”他指着车上的铝块说：“这是国家的财产，我们一定要保管好。”
    听了老杨的这番话，我马上卷起袖子，跟着老杨和同志们一起卸车了。
