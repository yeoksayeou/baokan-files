Military and civilian personnel across the country are holding discussions on the important editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily. They are studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation and are determined to follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment and advance with victory.

It is essential to always use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation, to emphasize education on the situation, to extensively discuss the unprecedented excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to extensively discuss the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and to extensively discuss the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This will ensure that we always maintain a clear mind and the correct direction.

A Xinhua News Agency report from November 9th stated that the editorial "Focus on Education on the Situation" in the People's Liberation Army Daily on November 9th conveyed the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any other time. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. No mass movement has ever been mobilized as broadly and deeply as this one." This greatly inspired revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary officials across the country. They said, "We must study it seriously and propagate it widely. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and observe the situation, emphasize education on the situation, extensively discuss the unprecedented excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extensively discuss the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and extensively discuss the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This will ensure that we always maintain a clear mind and the correct direction, follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and more consciously and effectively implement Chairman Mao's great instructions. We will seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

After the publication of the editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily, revolutionary masses across the country, with hearts full of excitement, held study sessions, experience-sharing meetings, or situation reports. The more they studied, the more they felt that Chairman Mao's analysis of the situation was incredibly insightful and correct, the more they felt that Mao Zedong Thought was immensely powerful, and the more they studied, the clearer the direction became. Members of the core group of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress said during their study and discussion: The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. It is excellent because the masses have been broadly and fully mobilized, because the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev has been destroyed, because the movement to study Chairman Mao's works has entered a new stage, because Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, because bourgeois ideology has been greatly impacted, and because the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks is being guided onto the path of proletarian revolution. What we need to do now is to extensively discuss the excellent revolutionary situation, boost the morale of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, crush the arrogance of the class enemies, greatly enhance the class consciousness of the revolutionary masses, and more consciously follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Many local and unit revolutionary committees, revolutionary committee preparatory groups, and revolutionary mass organizations have deeply felt through more than a year of cultural revolution struggle practice that emphasizing education on the situation is extremely important. Only by constantly using the great Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation with the broad revolutionary masses, and by analyzing and summarizing the new trends, new achievements, new experiences, and new problems that arise in the movement, can we step by step follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, correctly understand and firmly implement the policies and directives set by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and ensure that the cultural revolution advances from victory to new victories. Some leaders of the "Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters" said, "Whenever we have a relatively correct understanding of the political situation, we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more quickly and closely, and our work is on the right track; whenever we cannot correctly understand the political situation, we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment less closely, and our work is prone to errors." They unanimously agreed that the editorial "Focus on Education on the Situation" in the People's Liberation Army Daily is a very important article. Not only leaders should study it well, but also the broad masses of soldiers should study it well, to better understand the current excellent situation, further mobilize revolutionary enthusiasm, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, be alert to the desperate struggles and counterattacks of the class enemies, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The standing committee members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee have been discussing the excellent situation across the country and the province at every meeting in recent days. Many comrades, when studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also placed themselves in the situation, using Mao Zedong Thought to examine and compare their worldview and method of looking at problems. They said, "When we analyze the situation, we must look at the essence and the mainstream. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, correctly estimate and analyze the current situation, correctly understand and consciously implement Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's policies, directives, and deployments, emphasize education on the situation, and make the people of the entire province better grasp Mao Zedong Thought and better advance in the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao."

Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and revolutionary officials across the country expressed their determination with high spirits while studying the editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily, saying, "The great victories we have achieved are only the first step of our great cause's ten-thousand-li long march. We must be humble and cautious, and in this unprecedented excellent situation, more consciously follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, more broadly and deeply carry out the great criticism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, do a good job in struggle-criticism-transformation in local areas and units, focus on revolution and vigorously promote production, and be determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end as proletarian revolutionaries."

A Xinhua News Agency report from November 9th stated that the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces today seriously studied the important editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily: "Focus on Education on the Situation." With hearts full of excitement, they repeatedly studied the editorial's conveyance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any other time. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. No mass movement has ever been mobilized as broadly and deeply as this one." They unanimously expressed their determination to emphasize education on the situation, further recognize the unprecedented excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and more consciously follow the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment. They will do a better job in defending the motherland, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the "three supports and two militaries" and other work.

Early this morning, after many units heard the important editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily on the radio, they immediately launched study activities. The cadres and soldiers extensively discussed the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A certain unit of the Navy organized a report meeting and experience-sharing meeting on the excellent situation. Some ships and companies also held "letter exhibitions," reflecting the great achievements of the billion people of our country under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through letters from all over the country. Border defense troops stationed in Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places braved the cold to propagate the spirit of the editorial and discuss the excellent revolutionary situation. Members participating in the plenary meeting of the Air Force Party Committee and representatives participating in the Beijing Garrison's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works all specially discussed the spirit of the editorial and determined to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions well and emphasize education on the situation.

The broad cadres and soldiers pointed out in their study and discussion that the situation of the cultural revolution is developing very rapidly. Only by constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation of class struggle can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and do a good job in various tasks. Many cadres and soldiers in the Beijing, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Guangzhou garrisons said, "Correct policies, directives, and deployments come from a correct analysis of the political situation and a correct assessment of class forces. Only by correctly recognizing the situation can we deeply understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly grasp the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle, and steadfastly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; only then can we see far and wide, and in the revolutionary struggle, always maintain a clear mind." Many cadres and soldiers in the Nanjing, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Jinan, Lanzhou, and Kunming garrisons believed in their discussion that Mao Zedong Thought is the telescope and microscope for observing and analyzing the situation of class struggle. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation can we grasp the essence, see the mainstream, recognize the direction, and always advance.

The broad cadres and soldiers of various general departments, military branches, and the Beijing Garrison and Qinghai troops, when studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation, reviewed the glorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They pointed out that the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have spread across the entire country, with billions of people mobilized, forming a vast revolutionary army, destroying the counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized as never before. All of this most vividly and eloquently illustrates that the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the greatest. Through their review, the cadres and soldiers had a deeper understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a greater love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and a greater hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev.

Many military party committees and leading organs, when studying the editorial, also seriously summarized the experience of conducting education on the situation in the previous stage, repeatedly studied the plans and measures for strengthening the army's education on the situation, and determined to mobilize the masses widely, make the education on the situation lively and vivid, and ensure that the broad cadres and soldiers always grasp the correct direction, follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    各地军民纷纷座谈讨论《解放军报》重要社论
    认真学习毛主席关于形势的最新指示
    决心紧跟毛主席的战略部署乘胜前进
    一定要经常用毛泽东思想观察和分析形势，抓好形势教育，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，始终保持清醒的头脑和正确的方向。
    新华社九日讯　《解放军报》九日社论《抓好形势教育》传达了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”极大地鼓舞了全国各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众、红卫兵小将和革命干部。他们说，我们一定要认真学习，广泛宣传。我们一定要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想分析和观察形势，抓好形势教育，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，始终保持清醒的头脑和正确的方向，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，更自觉更得力地贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    《解放军报》社论发表后，各地革命群众怀着无比兴奋的心情，纷纷举行学习座谈会、讲用会或形势报告会。大家越学越感到毛主席对形势的分析无比英明正确，越学越感到毛泽东思想威力无穷，越学方向看得越明。北京市工代会核心组成员在学习和座谈时说：无产阶级文化大革命形势就是大好，好在群众广泛、充分发动起来了，好在以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命的资产阶级司令部被摧毁了，好在学习毛主席著作的群众运动进入了新阶段，好在毛泽东思想空前大普及，好在资产阶级思想受到了大冲击，好在我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想正在被引导到无产阶级革命的轨道。我们现在就是要大讲特讲大好革命形势，大长无产阶级革命派和革命群众的志气，大灭阶级敌人的威风，大大提高革命群众的阶级觉悟，更加自觉地紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。内蒙古自治区革命委员会主任委员滕海清在形势报告会上说，形势大好最本质的内容，就是毛主席所指出的“人民群众充分发动起来了”，就是毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线空前广泛、深刻地掌握了广大革命群众。我们学习领会毛主席关于形势的最新指示，必须抓住最本质的东西，看得远一点，想得深一点，努力吃透最高指示的基本精神。我们正确认识了大好形势，就能更加充满信心，狠斗“私”字，放开眼界看未来，更正确地理解和更自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    许多地方和单位的革命委员会、革命委员会筹备小组和革命群众组织，通过一年多来的文化大革命斗争实践深刻体会到，抓好形势教育极为重要。只有经常地和广大革命群众一起，用伟大的毛泽东思想观察、分析形势，对运动中出现的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题进行分析和总结，才能步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正确理解和坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席和党中央制定的方针政策，保证文化大革命从胜利走向新的胜利。上海“工总司”的一些负责人说，凡是我们对政治形势分析认识比较正确的时候，对毛主席的伟大战略部署就跟得快，跟得紧，工作就对头；凡是我们对政治形势不能正确认识的时候，对毛主席的伟大战略部署就跟得不紧，工作就容易犯错误。他们一致认为，《解放军报》社论《抓好形势教育》，是一篇极其重要的文章，不仅负责人要好好学，广大战士也要好好学，要更好地认识当前大好形势，进一步调动革命积极性，继续发扬革命造反精神，警惕阶级敌人垂死挣扎和反扑，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。黑龙江省革命委员会的常委们，最近几天每次开会，都首先畅谈当前全国和全省的大好形势。许多同志在领会毛主席的最新指示时，还把自己摆进去，用毛泽东思想检查对照自己的世界观和看问题的方法。他们说，我们分析形势，一定要看本质，看主流。我们一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，正确估计和分析当前形势，正确地理解和贯彻执行毛主席和党中央制定的方针、政策和部署，抓好形势教育，使全省人民更好地掌握毛泽东思想，更好地沿着伟大领袖毛主席所指引的方向前进。
    各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众、红卫兵小将和革命干部在学习《解放军报》社论时意气风发地表示，我们已经取得的伟大胜利，还只是我们伟大事业的万里长征的第一步。我们一定要戒骄戒躁，在空前大好形势下，更自觉地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更广泛、深入地开展革命大批判，巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本地区、本单位斗批改，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    新华社九日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，今天认真学习了《解放军报》的重要社论：《抓好形势教育》。他们怀着万分激动的心情，一遍又一遍地学习了社论传达的伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”他们一致表示决心抓好形势教育，进一步认清当前无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，更加自觉地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，把保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”等各项工作做得更好。
    今天清早，许多单位从广播里听到《解放军报》的重要社论后，立即展开了学习活动。指战员们大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。海军某部组织了大好形势报告会、讲用会，有的舰艇、连队还举办“家信展览”，通过来自全国各地的封封家信，反映出我国亿万人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中取得的伟大成就。驻守在西藏、新疆、内蒙古等地的边防部队，冒着严寒，宣传社论精神，畅谈大好革命形势。正在参加空军党委全体会议的成员、正在参加北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表，都专门讨论了社论精神，决心学好毛主席的最新指示，抓好形势教育。
    广大指战员们在学习讨论中指出，文化大革命的形势发展非常迅速，只有不断用毛泽东思想观察、分析阶级斗争的形势，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署做好各项工作。北京、武汉、沈阳、广州等部队的许多指战员说，正确的方针、政策和部署，来源于对政治形势的正确分析和对阶级势力的正确估量。只有正确认识形势，才能更深刻地领会毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边；才能站得高，看得远，在革命斗争中始终保持清醒的头脑。南京、福州、成都、济南、兰州、昆明等部队许多指战员在讨论中认为，毛泽东思想是观察、分析阶级斗争形势的望远镜和显微镜，只有运用毛泽东思想分析形势，才能抓住本质，看清主流，认清方向，永远前进。
    各总部、各军种兵种和北京卫戍区部队、青海驻军广大指战员，在学习毛主席关于形势问题的最新指示时，都回顾了无产阶级文化大革命的光辉历程。他们指出，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，燃遍了全中国，亿万人民发动起来，组成了浩浩荡荡的革命大军，摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命的资产阶级司令部，战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前未有的大普及。所有这一切，最生动最雄辩地说明无产阶级文化大革命的成绩最大最大最大。指战员们通过回顾，对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义有了更深刻的理解，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，对中国的赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨。
    许多部队党委和领导机关在学习社论的时候，还认真总结了前一阶段进行形势教育的经验，反复研究了加强部队形势教育的计划和措施，决心广泛发动群众，把形势教育搞得轰轰烈烈，生动活泼，使广大指战员始终掌握正确的方向，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
