The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has forcefully impacted every family, bringing about earth-shaking changes. The family of soldier Xia Jia is no exception.

Xia Jia's father is the deputy principal of a financial and commercial cadre school, and his mother is the director of the Women's Federation. Due to their lack of understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution, they have been slow to come forward and participate in the struggle. Xia Jia's younger brother and sister are students at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, both of whom are daring and enterprising Red Guards, and have long been dissatisfied with their parents' situation.

A fierce struggle is brewing in this ordinary cadre's family. The two young warriors discussed, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. Father and Mother are both in positions of authority. They neither come out to join the rebel faction nor support our revolutionary actions. We should help them." They then posted a big-character poster, sharply criticizing their parents.

Xia Jia's father, after seeing the big-character poster, was very angry, thinking, "Others have already posted big-character posters against me, and now you have too!" From then on, whenever the four of them were together, they would engage in debates. They debated for half a month, reaching a stalemate, always "two to two." Xiao Hong remembered that her older brother was in the army, so she wrote a letter to seek his support.

Xia Jia, after reading his sister's letter, was both happy and troubled. He was happy because the young warriors' revolutionary spirit was truly strong and should be firmly supported; he was troubled because he feared "offending" his parents. Just as he was in a dilemma, Chairman Mao's great directive on "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left" was issued. Xia Jia immediately made up his mind, firmly supporting his younger brother and sister's revolutionary actions, and wrote a letter urging his parents to come forward and participate in the revolutionary struggle.

With the support of his older brother, the situation in the family debate changed, from "two to two" to "three to two." The younger brother and sister were very happy, and their confidence in winning increased. Every time they returned home, they studied Chairman Mao's works together with their parents.

With the help of their children, Xia Jia's parents quickly came to their senses and actively came forward to participate in the struggle. Later, they became "three-in-one combination" targets in the school and organization.

    三比二
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，猛烈地冲击着每一个家庭，引起了翻天覆地的变化。战士小贾的家庭也没有例外。
    小贾的父亲是财贸干校的副校长，母亲是妇联主任，由于对文化大革命的伟大意义很不理解，迟迟没有站出来参加斗争。小贾的弟弟和妹妹在抗大战校念书，都是敢闯敢干的红卫兵小将，对父母的情况早就不满意了。
    一场激烈的斗争在这个普通干部的家庭中酝酿着。两位小将议论着：“无产阶级文化大革命是触及灵魂的大革命，父亲和母亲都是当权派，他们既不站出来参加造反派，又不支持我们的革命行动，我们应该帮助他们。”于是就贴出一张大字报，尖锐地向父母提出了批评。
    小贾的父亲看了这张大字报，很生气，心想：“别人已经给我贴了大字报，你们也给贴起来了！”从此，四口人到一起，就展开辩论。一直辩论了半个月，相持不下，老是“二比二”。小红想起了大哥是解放军，于是写信争取他的支持。
    小贾看了妹妹的信，又高兴，又为难。高兴的是，小将造反精神真强，应当坚决支持；为难的是，怕“得罪”了父母。正在进退两难，毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号令发布了，小贾立即下了决心，坚决支持弟弟妹妹的革命行动，写信劝父母亲站出来参加革命斗争。
    有了哥哥的支持，家庭辩论的形势发生了变化，“二比二”成了“三比二”。弟弟妹妹都很高兴，争取胜利的信心更足了。他们每次回家都和父母亲一起学习毛主席著作。
    在儿女们的帮助下，小贾的父母亲很快觉悟过来，积极站出来参加斗争，后来成了学校、机关“三结合”对象。
