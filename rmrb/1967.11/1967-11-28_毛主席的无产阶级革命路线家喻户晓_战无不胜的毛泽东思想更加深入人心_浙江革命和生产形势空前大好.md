After more than a year of intense, complex, and fierce class struggle, Zhejiang Province, located on China's coastal defense front, has seen an unprecedentedly good situation in its Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has become known to all; the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been deeply rooted in people's hearts; and the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached an unprecedented high tide. Now, from the remote mountains of southern Zhejiang to the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou plain in northern Zhejiang, from the border of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces in western Zhejiang to the Zhoushan Islands in the East China Sea, the broad revolutionary masses in factories, rural areas, urban streets, government agencies, and schools throughout the province, regardless of gender or age, all care about state affairs and actively participate in the Cultural Revolution. No previous mass movement has been as widely mobilized and deeply rooted as this one.

The most inspiring aspect of Zhejiang's unprecedentedly good situation in the Cultural Revolution is that the great Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized and spread. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become essential for every revolutionary's struggle and life. Throughout the province, whether in cities or rural areas, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a high tide. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have enthusiastically and resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness and repudiate revisionism," quickly establishing tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in cities and rural areas across the province, with over 500,000 people participating in the study. Various places have also widely held meetings to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and to criticize and repudiate revisionism. The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres throughout the province, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and prior to everything. With deep class feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, they study and apply Chairman Mao's works every day, in everything. They excitedly say: The power of Mao Zedong Thought is greater than the sky and the earth; Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is closer than parents; Chairman Mao's favor is deeper than rivers and seas; Chairman Mao's books are better than anything else.

The revolutionary masses in various places in Zhejiang Province have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and launched a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and struggle-criticism-transformation. Revolutionary criticism columns are ubiquitous in factories, government agencies, schools, and streets throughout the province. Many rural people's communes have also held criticism meetings in the fields and at home. Jiaxing County has promoted the experience of deeply carrying out criticism at the production team level, with the broad revolutionary masses taking action, criticizing verbally and in writing, closely combining it with the struggle-criticism-transformation in their own units, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and fiercely criticizing the revisionist trash of the Chinese Khrushchev. The revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary unity. More than 90% of the factories, government agencies, and schools in Hangzhou City have achieved revolutionary unity. The broad revolutionary masses in various prefectures and counties throughout the province are actively developing and consolidating revolutionary unity politically, ideologically, and organizationally under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad revolutionary factions throughout the province have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, enthusiastically helped revolutionary leading cadres to come forward, boldly liberated and used cadres, and are creating conditions for the rapid establishment of revolutionary committees.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," the industrial and agricultural production situation in Zhejiang Province is also better than ever. The total industrial output value of the province in October increased by 8.9% compared to September. Some factories and enterprises have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded them. After the bumper harvests of spring grain and early rice, late rice has also been harvested well. Cotton, hemp, cocoons, and tea have all been harvested well. Marine fishery production along the coast of the province has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. The province's railways, highways, and inland waterways are unobstructed. The market is bustling, and the supply of goods is sufficient, presenting a prosperous scene in both urban and rural areas.

The great People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits in grasping the revolution and promoting production throughout the province. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks in various places in Zhejiang have resolutely carried out the instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao, firmly stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, taken a clear stand, and firmly supported the broad leftist masses. They have also actively gone deep into factories, government agencies, schools, and rural people's communes to help establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, arm the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and have made new contributions to promoting the thought revolutionization of people, seizing the double victory of revolution and production.

    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线家喻户晓
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加深入人心
    浙江革命和生产形势空前大好
    据新华社杭州二十五日电　经过一年多来尖锐、复杂、激烈的阶级斗争，地处我国海防前哨的浙江省，无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势空前大好，越来越好。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，已经家喻户晓；战无不胜的毛泽东思想更加深入人心；活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动空前高涨。现在，从浙南偏僻山区到浙北杭嘉湖平原，从浙西闽浙赣三省边境到东海的舟山群岛，全省工厂、农村、城镇街道、机关、学校的广大革命群众，无论男女老少，人人关心国家大事，积极参加文化大革命。从来的群众运动，都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。
    浙江文化大革命空前大好形势中最最令人欢欣鼓舞的：是伟大的毛泽东思想得到了空前大普及、大传播。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已经成为每一个革命者斗争和生活的必需。全省不论城市、农村，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动形成了高潮。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众，最积极最坚决地响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，在全省各地城乡迅速办起了上万个毛泽东思想学习班，已有五十多万人参加了学习。各地还普遍地举行了活学活用毛主席著作和“斗私，批修”讲用会。全省各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，以中国人民解放军为榜样，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、重于一切、先于一切的地位。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情，做到毛主席著作天天学，天天用，事事学，事事用。他们激动地说：天大地大，不如毛泽东思想威力大；爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席的革命路线亲；河深海深，不如毛主席的恩情深；千好万好，不如毛主席的宝书好。
    浙江省各地无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，掀起了革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合和斗批改的新高潮。全省各地城镇的革命大批判专栏，遍布工厂、机关、学校和街道。许多农村人民公社也纷纷举办田头批判会、家庭批判会。嘉兴县推广以生产队为单位深入开展大批判的经验，广大革命群众人人动手，口诛笔伐，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，用毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货。革命的大批判推动了革命的大联合。杭州市百分之九十以上的工厂、机关、学校，已实现了革命大联合。全省各专区、县的广大革命群众，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，也正在积极地从政治上、思想上、组织上，广泛地发展和巩固革命的大联合。
    全省广大革命派认真学习毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，热情帮助革命领导干部站出来，大胆解放干部和使用干部，正为迅速建立革命委员会创造条件。
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指引下，浙江全省工农业生产形势也空前大好。全省工业生产总产值，十月份比九月份又增长了百分之八点九。部分工厂企业已提前超额完成全年生产计划。粮食生产继春粮、早稻大丰收之后，晚稻又获得了好收成。棉、麻、茧、茶，收成都很好。全省沿海渔业生产，比去年增长一成多。全省铁路、公路、内河航运畅通。市场繁荣，货源充足，城乡呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    伟大的中国人民解放军在全省抓革命、促生产中建立了不朽的功勋。在浙江各地执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员，坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的指示，坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决支持左派广大群众。他们还深入工厂、机关、学校和农村人民公社，积极帮助举办毛泽东思想学习班，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，为促进人的思想革命化，为夺取革命和生产的双胜利，建立了新的功劳。
