The 6408 Unit of the People's Liberation Army has gained important experience in executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in Anhui Province. They firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's instructions to "support the leftist broad masses." They have helped the two major revolutionary mass organizations achieve revolutionary unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, thus bringing about a favorable situation for the Cultural Revolution in Anhui Province. Their key experience is to firmly support the left without supporting factions.

The unit's Party Committee believes that in supporting the left, one must not stand on one side of a revolutionary mass organization. If the supporting unit stands on one side, it will inevitably pressure another part of the revolutionary masses, which is not conducive to revolutionary unity. Therefore, they treat the two factions equally and promote unity based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought. Initially, some revolutionaries did not understand this approach, thinking it lacked clear principles and was merely compromising. After a period of practice, the broad revolutionary masses realized that the 6408 Unit's actions were genuinely supporting Mao Zedong's revolutionary line and truly helping them.

The 6408 Unit supports or does not support an organization based on whether it genuinely loves and unconditionally supports Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters led by Mao, and whether it unconditionally executes the decisions of Mao and the Party Central Committee. They firmly support any revolutionary mass organization that is loyal to Mao, resolutely implements Mao's revolutionary line, and executes the orders of the proletarian headquarters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Cultural Revolution." The 6408 Unit has learned from their support work that the unit must be good at guiding revolutionary masses to struggle against petty-bourgeois factionalism, wholeheartedly helping them to carry out self-criticism and criticize revisionism, so they can overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and advance along Mao's revolutionary line.

In their support work, the 6408 Unit vigorously propagates Mao Zedong Thought, establishes Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and uses all means to guide the broad revolutionary masses to follow Mao's great strategic deployment. They have realized that as long as the work among the broad revolutionary masses is done well and the masses are truly mobilized, the few who want to engage in petty-bourgeois factionalism will be resisted by the broad revolutionary masses. Class enemies who try to use factionalism to stir up trouble will inevitably lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet, meeting a shameful failure.

Firmly supporting the left without supporting factions is key to vigorously promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works within the unit, using "criticize revisionism, rectify the self" as the main focus, and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts. The Party Committees at various levels of the 6408 Unit often mobilize cadres and soldiers to use the "Three Articles" as weapons to break down private interests and establish public interests, sparking a revolution in their souls. The broad cadres and soldiers often study Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's relevant instructions, consciously examine and check their words and actions, and often carry out criticism and self-criticism, ensuring that the unit always maintains clear principles and stands firm, regardless of any interference or impact, firmly supporting the left without supporting factions.

    解放军六四○八部队取得重要经验
    坚决支左不支派
    关键在于狠抓部队活学活用毛主席著作，克服形形色色非无产阶级思想
    本报讯　解放军6408部队在安徽省执行“三支”“两军”任务中，坚决按照毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，帮助两大派革命群众组织在毛泽东思想原则基础上，实现革命大联合，使安徽省无产阶级文化大革命出现一派大好形势。他们在支左工作中取得一条重要经验是：坚持支左不支派。
    这个部队党委认为，在支左中，对待两派革命群众组织，绝不能片面地站在某一革命群众组织一边。如果支左部队片面地站在某个组织的一边，就势必对另一部分革命群众产生压力，不利于革命的大联合。因此，他们对待两派革命群众组织，一视同仁，促进两派在毛泽东思想的原则基础上联合起来。部队这样做，开始有些革命群众不理解，认为这样旗帜不鲜明，搞折衷，和稀泥。经过一段时间的实践，广大革命群众认识到：6408部队这样做，是真正站在毛主席革命路线一边，是真心实意地支持我们，帮助我们。
    6408部队对一个组织支持不支持，是看它对毛主席、对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，是不是真正地热爱，无条件地拥护；对毛主席和党中央的决定是不是无条件地执行。凡是忠于毛主席，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，坚决执行无产阶级司令部的命令的革命群众组织，他们就坚决支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”6408部队在支左工作实践中体会到，部队要坚持支左不支派，就必须善于引导革命群众同小资产阶级派性作斗争，满腔热忱地帮助他们开展斗私批修，使他们克服小资产阶级派性，沿着毛主席的革命路线前进。
    6408部队在支左工作中，大力宣传毛泽东思想，大办毛泽东思想学习班，尽最大的努力，用一切办法，引导广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们体会到，只要把广大革命群众的工作做好了，群众真正发动起来了，极少数人要搞小资产阶级派性，就会遭到广大革命群众的抵制。阶级敌人想利用派性进行挑拨离间，就必然会搬起石头打自己的脚，遭到可耻的失败。
    坚持支左不支派，关键在于狠抓部队活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，克服形形色色的非无产阶级思想。6408部队各级党委经常发动干部、战士以“老三篇”为武器，破私立公，在灵魂深处爆发革命。广大干部、战士经常学习毛主席和党中央的有关指示，自觉对照检查自己的言论和行动，经常开展批评和自我批评，使部队始终旗帜鲜明，坚持原则，不管受到什么样的干扰和冲击，坚持支左不支派。
