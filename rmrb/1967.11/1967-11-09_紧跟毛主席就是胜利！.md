Following Chairman Mao means victory!

A unprecedentedly good situation has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi. Throughout the province, a vast movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is sweeping across cities and countryside. Driven by the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination, a warm scene of supporting the army and loving the people is unfolding. There is an unprecedented surge in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on November 8, after more than a year of intense and fierce class struggle, Jiangxi Province's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has presented an unprecedentedly good situation. From the foot of Jinggang Mountain to the banks of Poyang Lake, from cities to rural areas, everywhere is a scene of revolutionary fervor. Every factory, rural people's commune, government agency, school, and military unit, down to every family, has been swept into the great tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people, and the masses have been fully mobilized.

As the movement deepens, revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination are surging one after another, victory after victory. Currently, all six districts, two cities, and more than eighty counties in the province have achieved revolutionary unity. In the provincial capital of Nanchang, more than 95% of the units have achieved revolutionary unity by system, by industry, and by class. Millions of revolutionary masses have organized themselves into a powerful cultural revolution army. The broad revolutionary masses have directed the boundless enthusiasm aroused by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production and work, powerfully promoting the development of socialist construction. Since the fourth quarter, the province's industrial daily output has significantly increased compared to the previous quarter. Mechanical industry has grown by 65%, textile industry by 34%, light industry by 32%, handicraft industry by 6%, and steel and coal have also seen significant increases. Following the bumper harvest of early rice across the province, the late rice harvest is also excellent. Oil crops, hemp, and other economic crops have seen a rare bumper harvest in history. Livestock and forestry have also developed. The province's urban and rural transportation is smooth, with railways, highways, and waterways in good order. Urban and rural markets are bustling, with abundant goods, effectively promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

The revolutionary Jiangxi proletariat, the heroic children of Jinggang Mountain, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and the most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on conducting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the intense and complex class struggle, they have established a firm belief: "Following Chairman Mao means victory!" "Do as Chairman Mao instructs." They use their attitude towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the standard to measure everything. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, they act on it immediately and decisively; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, they firmly resist and struggle against it. They study and apply Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest ideological weapon to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism. They have exposed, criticized, and fought against the treacherous plots of the clique of power-holders within the party taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Jiangxi, who betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat and attempted to restore capitalism. Recently, they have actively responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, using the boundless Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, fiercely fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and self-criticism and revisionism struggle meetings have quickly been set up across the province's cities and countryside. Many revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, Red Guards, government officials, and People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers have taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, analyzing and criticizing the non-proletarian thoughts in their minds as part of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

The working class has played a decisive role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi. They have joined forces with the Red Guards and played a leading role in the struggle to smash the bourgeois headquarters and their agents in Jiangxi. They have taken the lead in the high tides of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination. They have shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, maintaining the revolutionary order with the spirit of masters.

The People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province. The troops sent to Jiangxi to carry out the task of supporting the left have firmly carried out the instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao, stood firmly, held high the banner, supported the broad leftist masses, and supported the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its affiliated organizations, helping them quickly gain the upper hand politically and organizationally. The broad officers and soldiers of the supporting-left troops have helped the proletarian revolutionaries arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, accelerating the revolutionization of their thinking.

In more than a year of intense and fierce struggle, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi Province has thoroughly exposed and overthrown the clique of power-holders within the party taking the capitalist road; their bourgeois reactionary line has been thoroughly exposed, and their series of counter-revolutionary revisionist lines have thoroughly failed. The revolutionary people have been fully tempered, and their strength has been fully demonstrated.

Now, what lies before us is: a vast movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works sweeping across the entire province's cities and countryside; a good situation of revolutionary unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination developing vigorously under the drive of revolutionary criticism; a warm scene of supporting the army and loving the people; an unprecedented surge in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

    紧跟毛主席就是胜利！
    江西无产阶级文化大革命一片空前大好形势
    全省展现一个遍布城乡的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的洪流，一个在革命大批判推动下蓬勃发展的革命大联合和革命三结合的大好局面，一个拥军爱民的热烈景象，一个前所未有的抓革命促生产的新高潮。
    据新华社南昌八日电　经过一年多尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，江西省无产阶级文化大革命出现了空前未有的大好形势，从井冈山麓到波阳湖畔，从城市到农村，到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。每个工厂、农村人民公社、机关、学校、部队，直到每个家庭，都投入了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大洪流。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线越来越深入人心，广大群众充分地发动起来了。
    随着运动的深入发展，革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合，一个高潮接一个高潮，一个胜利接着一个胜利。目前，全省六个专区、二个市、八十多个县，实现了革命的大联合。在省会南昌，百分之九十五以上的单位，按系统、按行业、按班级实现了革命的大联合。千百万革命群众组织起来，形成了一支坚强的文化革命大军。广大革命群众把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲，用到生产和工作中去，有力地推动了社会主义生产建设事业的发展。第四季度以来，全省工业日产水平较上一季度大幅度上升。机械工业增长百分之六十五，纺织工业增加百分之三十四，轻化工业增长百分之三十二，手工业增长百分之六，钢铁、煤炭都有较大幅度的增长。农业继全省早稻大丰收以后，晚稻又是个好年成。油料、麻类等经济作物是历史上少有的大丰收。畜牧业、林业，都有所发展。全省城乡交通畅通无阻，铁路、公路、航运秩序井然。城乡市场活跃，物资丰富，有力地促进了工农业生产的发展。
    富于革命斗争精神的江西无产阶级革命派，英雄的井冈山儿女，最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，忠实地执行毛主席关于进行无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。他们在尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，树立了一个坚强的信念：“紧跟毛主席就是胜利！”“毛主席怎么指示，就怎么办。”他们把对毛主席的态度，对毛泽东思想的态度，对毛主席革命路线的态度，作为衡量一切的标准。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，他们就闻风而动，坚决照办，大办特办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，他们就坚决抵制，坚决斗争。他们用最大的热情活学活用毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，并且以毛泽东思想这个最锐利的思想武器，深入开展革命的大批判，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在江西的代理人背叛无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，彻底肃清他们的流毒。最近，他们又积极响应伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命，狠斗“私”字，狠批修正主义。全省城乡很快地办起数以千计的毛泽东思想学习班和斗私批修讲用会。许多革命工人、革命农民、红卫兵小将、机关干部、人民解放军指战员，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把自己头脑中非无产阶级思想提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的纲上来分析批判，大大地促进了人的思想革命化。
    工人阶级在江西文化大革命运动中，起了决定性的作用。他们和红卫兵结合在一起，在摧毁资产阶级司令部及其在江西的代理人的斗争中发挥了主力军的作用。他们在革命大批判、大联合、三结合的高潮中起了先锋和带头作用。他们挑起了革命和生产两副重担，以主人翁的精神，主动地维护革命秩序。
    中国人民解放军在江西省无产阶级文化大革命运动中建立了不朽的功勋。到江西省执行支左任务的部队，坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的指示，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，支持左派广大群众，支持经过考验的江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会及其所属组织，使他们很快地在政治上、组织上占了优势。支左部队广大指战员帮助无产阶级革命派用毛泽东思想武装头脑，加速了思想革命化。
    江西省无产阶级文化大革命运动在一年多的时间里，经过尖锐、激烈的斗争，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底地暴露了，彻底地垮台了；他们执行的资产阶级反动路线彻底暴露了，他们执行的一系列反革命修正主义路线也彻底失败了。革命人民得到了充分的锻炼，他们的力量充分地表现了出来。
    现在，展现在我们面前的是：一个遍布全省城乡的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的洪流；一个在革命大批判推动下蓬勃发展的革命大联合、革命三结合的大好局面；一个军爱民、民拥军的热烈景象；一个前所未有的抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
