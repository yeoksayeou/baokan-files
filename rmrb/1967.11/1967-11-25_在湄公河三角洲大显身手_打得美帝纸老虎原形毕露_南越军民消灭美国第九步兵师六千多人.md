The U.S. 9th Infantry Division, which entered the Mekong Delta at the beginning of this year, had by October been decimated by the Vietnamese people and soldiers of South Vietnam, with 6,200 of its soldiers killed, including an entire artillery battalion, a battalion command, four companies, and many platoons.

The report said that at the beginning of this year, two brigades of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division entered Long An (most of An Xuyen and Tien Giang provinces) and My Tho provinces, attempting to encroach on the liberated areas and rescue the puppet army's dire situation. However, they were beaten back and fell into the people's war of the people and soldiers of the Mekong Delta.

The 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division entered the Di An area of Long An Province on February 20, and the 3rd Brigade entered the Phuoc Long area of My Tho Province on January 22. As soon as they arrived in these areas, the people and soldiers of the two provinces established tight encirclement and annihilation rings around their strongholds. The people and soldiers of the two provinces, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, continuously attacked the enemy, making the American aggressors unable to defend themselves and causing them to lose sleep and appetite. In the thriving "Find and Annihilate the Americans" competition, the Di An encirclement ring annihilated 1,776 American soldiers from February to September, including an entire company; the Phuoc Long and Day Diem encirclement rings annihilated 1,115 enemy soldiers from March to September; and the Phuoc Long encirclement ring annihilated 1,229 enemy soldiers from January to June.

During these battles, the people and soldiers of the two provinces produced more than 20 "Brave Units in Annihilating Americans," over 350 "Heroes in Annihilating Americans," "Heroes in Destroying Military Vehicles," and "Heroes in Destroying Aircraft," including elderly people, women, teachers, and young heroes in their teens.

The U.S. 9th Infantry Division, after suffering continuous encirclement and attacks from the people and soldiers of the two provinces, launched many "sweeping" operations but all ended in heavy defeats. The 9th Infantry Division was beaten when attacking and could not hold when defending. Finally, the enemy had to dispatch a brigade from the 25th Infantry Division, the 199th Light Infantry Brigade, and a naval regiment to rescue them, but they met with the same failure. On the night of October 11 to the early morning of October 12, the people and soldiers of Long An Province launched an attack on Highway 4 in the Long Phu area, completely annihilating an artillery battalion of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division, killing and wounding nearly 200 enemy soldiers, destroying 10 cannons, 38 military vehicles, 52 barracks, and many warehouses. The people and soldiers of My Tho Province sank and damaged 16 enemy ships on the Ba Lai River on September 15, killing and wounding 500 American aggressors.

Vietnamese Liberation Army soldier Le Van Thao, in one battle, annihilated 13 American aggressors and shot down one American helicopter, earning the glorious title of "Hero in Annihilating Americans."

    在湄公河三角洲大显身手　打得美帝纸老虎原形毕露
    南越军民消灭美国第九步兵师六千多人
    新华社河内二十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，在今年年初进驻湄公河三角洲的美国第九步兵师，到今年十月为止，已被越南南方军民消灭了六千二百多名，其中包括全歼一个炮兵营、一个营指挥部、四个连和许多个排。
    报道说，今年年初，美国第九步兵师的两个旅进驻隆安（即新安省和堤岸省的大部分）和美萩两省，妄图蚕食解放区，挽救伪军的危局。但是它却被打得焦头烂额，陷入了湄公河三角洲军民的人民战争的汪洋大海中。
    美国第九步兵师的第二旅在二月二十日进驻隆安省的迪建地区，第三旅在一月二十二日进驻美萩省的平德地区。他们刚刚到达上述地区，这两省军民就建立起严密的歼美包围圈，把他们的据点包围起来。两省军民怀着对敌人的刻骨仇恨，不断袭击敌人，使美国强盗无法招架，寝食不安。在蓬勃发展的“找美国佬歼”竞赛运动中，迪建包围圈在二月到九月期间共消灭美军一千七百七十六名，包括全歼一个连；平静和日早包围圈从三月到九月消灭敌人一千一百十五名；平德包围圈从一月到六月消灭敌人一千二百二十九名。
    两省军民在这些战斗中，出现了“英勇歼美单位”二十多个，“歼美勇士”、“打军车勇士”和“打飞机勇士”三百五十多名，其中包括老人、妇女、教师和十几岁的小勇士。
    美国第九步兵师由于连续遭到两省军民的包围和袭击，曾发动了多次“扫荡”，但都遭到了惨重的失败。第九步兵师进攻挨了打，防守也守不住。最后，敌人不得不增派第二十五步兵师的一个旅、第一九九轻步兵旅和海军的一个战团前去营救，但也遭到了同样失败的命运。隆安省军民十月十一日夜间到十二日凌晨在四号公路上发动的袭击战中，在龙富地区全歼美国第九步兵师的一个炮兵营，打死打伤敌人近二百名，击毁大炮十门、军车三十八辆、营房五十二座和许多仓库。美萩省军民在九月十五日在巴莱河上击沉击伤敌人战船十六艘，打死打伤美国侵略军五百名。（附图片）
