Members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation Share Their Impressions of Visiting China
The Great Combat Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian Peoples Is Indestructible
They Warmly Praise the Brilliant Victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Tirana, Albanian newspapers reported that members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, who recently visited China for a friendly visit and participated in the activities marking the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, shared their impressions of visiting China after returning home, enthusiastically praising the indestructible combat friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

Comrade Ramiz Alia, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, a secretary of the Central Secretariat, and a member of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, gave a report on his impressions of visiting China at an expanded meeting of teachers and students of the Natural Sciences Department of the University of Tirana on November 2.

Comrade Alia spoke about the enthusiastic, brotherly, and heartfelt reception given to the Albanian delegation by the Chinese working people; about the extremely cordial meetings with the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and other leaders; and about the brotherly contacts with Chinese workers, peasants, soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. He said that these meetings demonstrated the brotherly combat friendship that binds our two peoples and two Marxist-Leninist parties together.

Comrade Alia particularly spoke about the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong. He said that this revolution fundamentally destroyed the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, headed by China's Khrushchev, and reduced to ashes the imperialists' and Khrushchev revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in China.

The audience listened attentively to Comrade Alia's report, repeatedly applauding with thunderous applause.

A similar report meeting was also held in Korça. At the meeting, Comrade Mihallaq Qishti, a member of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, spoke to the party and government cadres of the Korça District, leaders of various factories, enterprises, and organizations, about the enthusiastic reception given to the delegation by the brotherly Chinese people, about the boundless love of the Chinese people for the Albanian people, and about the great revolutionary friendship between the two parties and peoples of Albania and China, forged by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Similar report meetings and gatherings were also held in the Gjirokastër District. Comrade Teilo Meçini, a member of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, recounted to several hundred cadres and workers of the Gjirokastër District the delegation's very cordial meeting with the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, and the great achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects, especially the great victories of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrades Saranda and Zongo, members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation, also enthusiastically shared their impressions of visiting China during their meetings with the garrison soldiers, comrades of the Ministry of Interior, and cooperative members of Gjirokastër.

    据新华社地拉那电　据阿尔巴尼亚报纸报道：不久前来中国进行友好访问和参加中华人民共和国成立十八周年活动的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团成员回国后，在各地畅谈访华观感，热情颂扬阿中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团团员拉米兹·阿利雅，二日在地拉那大学自然科学系师生的扩大会议上，作了访华观感报告。
    阿利雅同志谈到了中国劳动群众对阿尔巴尼亚代表团热烈的、兄弟般的和满腔热情的接待；谈到了同中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和其他领导人的极其亲切的会见，同中国工人、农民、中国人民解放军指战员，同红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子的兄弟般的接触。他说，这些会见表现了连结我们两国人民和两个马克思列宁主义政党之间的兄弟般的战斗情谊。
    阿利雅同志特别谈到了由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的光辉胜利。他说，这一革命从根本上摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，使帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义企图在中国复辟资本主义的美梦化为灰烬。
    与会者聚精会神地听取了阿利雅同志的报告，不断报以暴风雨般掌声。
