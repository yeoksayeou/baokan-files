	We Communists are distinguished from all other political parties by our close ties with the broadest masses of the people.

	Mao Zedong

	Learn from Mistakes, Always Be with the Masses

	Member of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee, Former Secretary of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, Xu Leijian

	Our great leader Chairman Mao in his latest instructions teaches us: "We must properly solve the problem of relations between superiors and subordinates, and between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult the masses on all matters, and be the students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those who have the most practical experience."

	I have studied this latest instruction and received a very profound education.

	During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I made serious mistakes. Under the education of the great thought of Mao Zedong and with the sincere help of the revolutionary masses, I broke free from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line and returned to the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	My main mistake during the Cultural Revolution was my attitude towards the masses. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point means we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." I, however, went against Chairman Mao's teachings.

	On June 1, 1966, Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster. This poster, like a sudden clap of thunder, immediately shook the nation. At that time, Qingdao, like the rest of the country, saw a wave of big-character posters and mass criticism, with the revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, exposing and criticizing the capitalist roaders within the party. However, just as the revolutionary masses were about to expose the capitalist roaders within the old municipal committee, I was anxious and fearful. I thought: the municipal committee is "revolutionary," and you (mainly referring to the revolutionary youngsters) are causing "chaos" by "rushing around and fighting." There must be "bad elements" behind this. Under the influence of this wrong thinking, I stood on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, together with the capitalist roaders within the old municipal committee, executing the bourgeois reactionary line of "suppressing a large number and protecting a few," labeling many revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," "rightists," and "ambitious elements," committing serious errors, and bringing extremely negative influences to the Cultural Revolution in Qingdao.

	The proletarian revolutionary masses in Qingdao, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, broke through layer upon layer of obstacles and achieved great victories in the struggle for power. They then, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shandong Province and Qingdao.

	I was one of the main leaders of the old municipal committee and executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement. It was only natural that I should be subjected to the masses' investigation and criticism. However, due to my selfishness, when the masses exposed and criticized me, I either could not accept it or had a resistant attitude. When the masses asked me to answer questions, I would stammer and avoid the main points, not daring to touch the core of the issue. As the movement deepened, I often went among the masses to accept criticism, and my contact with the proletarian revolutionary masses increased, as did the education I received. Many issues gradually became clear to me. I began to realize that my mistakes started from alienating myself from the masses and fearing the masses. To truly recognize and correct my mistakes, I could not adopt the method of "self-cultivation" and "reflecting in solitude" as advocated in "Self-Cultivation." I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must put politics in command, go among the people, be with the people, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better." I must go among the people and, in the revolutionary fire of the people's struggle, burn away my mistakes.

	At first, I did not fully understand the serious consequences caused by the old municipal committee and me faithfully executing the bourgeois reactionary line. Through great exposure, criticism, and struggle, I gradually awakened. The broad revolutionary masses are the direct victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. They, out of their limitless love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and out of their intense hatred for Liu Shaoqi, counter-revolutionary revisionism, and the bourgeois reactionary line, would become full of passion when mentioning Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and filled with righteous indignation when mentioning the bourgeois reactionary line. All of this, I saw with my own eyes and remembered in my heart. The more I listened, the more I was convinced, and the heavier my heart became. I never imagined that just because I implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, many revolutionary masses would suffer persecution. Countless shocking facts deeply educated me. I gradually recognized my mistakes and also recognized the various crimes of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Shandong Province and Qingdao.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." Through the masses' exposure and criticism, and by studying Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt both particularly close and extremely ashamed. In the past, in the eyes of the masses, I was no longer a servant of the people but an official. During the criticism, many masses said: if it were not for the Cultural Revolution, we would never have seen you big officials! If we had something to report, we would have to make ten or eight trips before being received; you rarely come down, and when you do, it's in a small car, either to see the secretary or the factory director. Where do you see the masses? You just know how to sit in the office, not investigate, not study, not consult the masses on matters, only allow yourselves to criticize the lower levels, not allow the masses to criticize you, and scold people at the slightest provocation. Who dares to speak!

	I felt that the masses' criticism of me was very accurate. This was an opinion I had never heard or wanted to hear before. Thinking about myself, I had indeed changed a lot. For more than ten years, I had enjoyed high positions and rich rewards, lived in luxury, alienated myself from the masses and reality, knew nothing about workers and peasants, let alone students, and did not understand their strong desires and demands for the socialist revolution. In my daily work, I only wanted to hear good things and did not want to hear bad things; when I heard negative opinions, especially those that touched my sore spots, I would feel resentful and always try to find excuses to suppress criticism. The masses had opinions about me, but they had no chance to express them and dared not to. During the Cultural Revolution, these opinions exploded, which was the greatest education and salvation for me. My mistakes during the Cultural Revolution were actually the development and concentration of my past mistakes.

	During the criticism, the masses said I was the "ringleader of suppressing the mass movement," and so on. At that time, I could not understand and had a lot of resistance. I thought, although I had made mistakes, it was not a matter of enemy versus us. Why did you have to put such a big hat on me? The comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction, targeting my active thoughts, asked me to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation on the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and a paragraph from the editorial of the 14th issue of "Red Flag" magazine last year: "For some excessive language and actions in the masses' criticism, one should not have any antagonistic feelings. One should see that their general direction is correct, understand their feelings, and believe that the majority of the masses are reasonable and understanding." After studying, I realized that my resistance was actually still an attitude problem towards the masses, a class standpoint and class feeling problem. When I executed the bourgeois reactionary line, I did not look at the general direction of the revolutionary masses but grasped some minor issues to suppress them; today, when the masses criticize me, I still do not look at the general direction but only at the minor issues, feeling dissatisfied. In essence, this is the same thing. The difference is that the situation has changed today, the proletarian revolutionary faction is in power, and I do not dare to openly suppress the masses. But I feel that if I do not solve this problem fundamentally, it is very dangerous. Once I have the chance, I might "relapse" and commit similar mistakes again.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us a bit wiser, and our work will be done better." I will definitely learn from the profound lessons of the movement, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

### 记取教训，时时刻刻和群众在一起

    我们共产党人区别于其他任何政党的又一个显著的标志，就是和最广大的人民群众取得最密切的联系。    毛泽东
    记取教训，时时刻刻和群众在一起
    青岛市革命委员会委员、原中共青岛市委书记处书记　徐雷健
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”我学习了这段最新指示，受到极为深刻的教育。
    我在无产阶级文化大革命中犯了严重错误，在伟大的毛泽东思想教育下，在无产阶级革命派热诚帮助下，才摆脱资产阶级反动路线的枷锁，回到了毛主席的革命路线一边。
    我在文化大革命中最主要的错误，就是对待群众的态度问题。毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我却违背了毛主席的教导。
    去年六月一日，毛主席亲自批准发表了第一张马列主义大字报。这张大字报，象平地一声春雷，立即震动了全国。当时，青岛也同全国各地一样，广大革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大鸣大放，大字报，矛头纷纷指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。但是，正当革命群众要揪出旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的时候，我却忧心忡忡，怕得要死。当时我想：市委是“革命”的，你们（主要是指革命小将）这样“乱冲乱斗”，简直是“胡闹”，背后一定有“坏人”操纵。在这种错误思想支配下，我就站在资产阶级反动路线一边，同旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一起，执行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，把许多革命群众打成了“反革命”、“右派”、“野心家”，犯下了严重错误，给青岛市的文化大革命带来了极为恶劣的影响。
    青岛市的无产阶级革命派，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，冲破了层层障碍，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。接着，又紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山东省、青岛市的代理人，展开了大揭发、大批判、大斗争。
    我是旧市委的主要领导成员之一，在运动中又执行了资产阶级反动路线，接受群众的审查和批判，是理所当然的事。但是，由于我“私”字当头，当群众揭发批判我的时候，不是听不进去，就是有抵触情绪。群众要我回答问题，也是吞吞吐吐，避重就轻，不敢触及灵魂。随着运动的深入发展，我经常到群众中去接受批判，同无产阶级革命派的接触越来越多，受到的教育越来越大，许多问题才逐渐想通了。我才开始认识到，自己犯错误，就是从脱离群众、害怕群众开始的，要真正认识和改正错误，决不能采取《修养》“闭门思过”的一套，必须按照毛主席的“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”的教导，到群众中去，在群众斗争的革命烈火中，烧掉自己的错误。
    开始，我对旧市委和我忠实执行资产阶级反动路线所造成的严重后果认识不足。经过大揭发、大批判、大斗争，我逐渐觉悟过来。广大革命群众是资产阶级反动路线的直接受害者，他们出于对毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的无限热爱，出于对中国赫鲁晓夫、反革命修正主义和资产阶级反动路线的无比愤恨，在发言中一提到毛主席的革命路线，就满腔热情，一提到资产阶级反动路线，就义愤填膺。所有这一切，都使我看在眼里，记在心里。我越听越服气，心情也越来越沉重。我万万没有想到，只是由于我贯彻执行了资产阶级反动路线，使大批革命群众遭受迫害。许许多多触目惊心的事实，深深地教育了我。我逐步认识了自己的错误，同时也认识了中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山东省、青岛市代理人的种种罪行。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。通过群众的揭发批判，再来学习毛主席的教导，既感到特别亲切，又非常惭愧。过去，在群众眼里，我已经不是人民的勤务员，而是官老爷。在接受批判时，有不少群众说：要不是文化大革命，我们可见不到你们这些大官呀！有事情找你们，十趟八趟都不接见；你们又常年不下来，偶而下来一次，也是坐着小汽车，不是找书记，就是找厂长，你们眼里哪里有群众？你们光知道坐办公室，不调查，不研究，有事不同群众商量，只许你们批评下边，不许群众批评你们，动不动就训人，谁还敢讲话！
    我觉得群众对我的批评十分中肯，这是我过去听不到也不愿意听的意见。想想自己，确实变的不轻，十多年来，高官厚禄，养尊处优，脱离群众，脱离实际，既不了解工农，更不了解学生，不理解他们对社会主义革命的强烈愿望和要求。在平时的工作中，只愿听好的，不愿听坏的；听到反面的意见，特别是刺到自己疼处的意见，就有反感，总是企图寻找借口，压制批评。群众对我有意见，平时没有机会讲，也不敢讲，文化大革命中爆发出来了，这对我是最大的教育，最大的挽救。我在文化大革命中的错误，实际上也是过去错误的发展和集中的暴露。
    在接受群众的批判时，群众说我是“镇压群众运动的罪魁祸首”等等。当时我思想不通，抵触情绪很大。心想，我虽然有错误，但还不是敌我问题，你们为什么要给我乱戴大帽子？无产阶级革命派的同志们，针对我的活思想，要我学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》这一光辉著作，学习去年《红旗》杂志十四期社论上的一段话：“对于群众批判中某些过头的语言和做法，不应当产生任何对抗的情绪，应当看到他们的大方向是正确的，应当理解他们的心情，应当相信群众的大多数，相信群众是通情达理的。”学习之后，我认识到自己这种抵触情绪，实际上还是对待群众的态度问题，是阶级立场和阶级感情问题。我过去执行资产阶级反动路线时，对革命群众就是不看他们的大方向，而是抓住一些枝节问题，借口压制他们；今天群众批判我，我还是不看大方向，只看枝节问题，心存不满，实质上这是一个东西。所不同的，是今天的情况变了，无产阶级革命派掌权了，我不能也不敢去公开压制群众了。但是我觉得，如果不从根本上解决这个问题，就很危险，一旦有了机会，我还会“旧病复发”，有可能再犯同类性质的错误。
    毛主席教导我们：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”我一定永远记取运动中的深刻教训，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极斗私批修，在文化大革命中立新功。
