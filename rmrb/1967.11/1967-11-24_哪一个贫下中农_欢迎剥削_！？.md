We poor and lower-middle peasants have been cruelly exploited and oppressed by the landlords for thousands of years, living like cattle and horses. Finally, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and smashed the chains of exploitation from our necks. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, seeing that we peasants are rebelling in the countryside and disturbing the dreams of the gentry, hates it so much that he gnashes his teeth. In the year 1950, after liberation, he shouted for the landlords and rich peasants, saying that "exploitation is meritorious" and that "peasants do not oppose exploitation but welcome it." This is a thoroughly reactionary fallacy, a deliberate attempt to push us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the old society's pit of fire, his intentions are so evil.

My family has been cruelly exploited by the landlords for generations. My father worked for the landlords all his life, eventually working himself to death, spitting blood, and being driven out by the landlords. My two elder brothers and I also worked for the landlords. Our family of seven still had nothing to eat or wear. The first landlord I worked for was named Wang Baopi. I worked for him for six years, but he didn't pay me a single penny and finally drove me out. The world is full of black crows. The second landlord I encountered was named Guo Laohan. I worked for him year-round, coming and going under the stars, but in the end, I got nothing. In terms of farming, I was one of the best in the village, but in terms of living conditions, I was the poorest. To change my poverty, I entered the third landlord's house. This landlord was named Na Qihouzi and was even more cunning. I worked for him for seven years, lacking food and clothes, and that's not all. One year, my father wove a mat to prepare for the New Year, but on the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month, the landlord's wife snatched it away to settle a debt. When I got married and had my first child, I didn't even have a diaper. I had no choice but to tear off the two patches from the knees of my pants to make a diaper for the child. Looking back at the landlords, they didn't carry a single burden or hold a single basket all year round, didn't move a single shovel, or touch a single knife. They ate until their mouths flowed with oil, and their faces were fat and round. Who did they rely on for their livelihood? They relied on us. Na Qihouzi, the year I entered his house, he only had two large carts, fourteen horses, and 140 mu of land. After I worked for his family for seven years, he had three large carts, eighteen horses, and 210 mu of land. At that time, he harvested 950 dan of grain per year, but only gave us 15 people who worked for him 77 dan. The grain we watered with our sweat was all cruelly exploited by the landlords. We lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Which poor and lower-middle peasant welcomes exploitation?

In our New Victory Village, there were twelve people who worked for the landlords in the old society, and none of them ever became a household head. The Chinese Khrushchev said, "Exploitation is meritorious." What merit is there in that? The poor people either worked themselves to death, or those who are still alive lack food and clothes. This is the merit? Fortunately, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party saved us poor people. The landlords owe us an uncountable debt and countless grievances. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party said, "Peasants do not oppose exploitation but welcome it." I heard this and was so angry that I gnashed my teeth and my lungs nearly burst. This big villain is truly heartless, malicious, and wolf-like. We must overthrow him and stomp on him, so he never stands up again.

    哪一个贫下中农“欢迎剥削”！？
    黑龙江省望奎县幸福公社敏六东大队　谢长有
    我们贫下中农几千年来受着地主老财的残酷剥削和压迫，过着牛马一般的生活。终于在毛主席、共产党的领导下推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，砸碎了套在我们脖子上的剥削枷锁。可是，党内最大的走资派，看到我们“农民在乡里造反，搅动了绅士们的酣梦”，就和地主、富农一样恨得咬牙切齿，竟在解放后的一九五○年，为地主、富农大喊大叫，说什么“剥削有功”，“农民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”这是反动透顶的谬论，是存心要把我们贫下中农再推进旧社会的火坑中去，他的用心该有多么恶毒。
    我的家世世代代受着地主老财的残酷剥削。我的父亲给地主扛了一辈子大活，最后累得吐血，被地主赶出门外。我的两个哥哥和我又给地主扛活，我们全家七口人还是没吃没穿。我扛活遇上的第一个地主叫王扒皮。我在他家扛了六年大活，一个钱没给，最后被轰了出来。天下乌鸦一般黑。我碰到的第二个地主叫郭老狠。我成年累月星星里来，星星里去，到头来还是个空。论干农活，我在全屯数一数二，论生活全屯数我最穷。为了改变穷境，我又进入第三个地主的大门，这个地主叫那六猴子，更狡猾。给他扛了七年大活，我缺吃少穿还不算，有一年，我的父亲编了一领炕席，准备过年铺炕，可是腊月二十八那天，却被地主婆抢走顶了债。我结婚生第一个孩子时，连一块褯子都没有，没办法把单裤膝盖上的两块补钉撕下来，给孩子做了块褯子。反过来看看地主老财，他们一年到头肩不担担，手不提篮，一锄不动，一刀不摸，吃的满嘴流油，肥头大耳，他们靠着谁养活？靠我们。那六猴子，我进他家大门的那年，他只有两台大车，十四匹马，一百四十垧土地。我给他家扛七年大活之后，他就有了三台大车，十八匹马，二百一十垧土地了。那时，他每年收九百五十石粮，给我们十五个扛活的只是七十七石。用我们汗水浇灌出来的粮食，全被地主残酷地剥削去了。我们过着牛马不如的生活。哪一个贫下中农“欢迎剥削”？
    我们新胜屯旧社会有十二个扛大活的，一辈子没成上家。中国赫鲁晓夫说：“剥削有功”，功在什么地方？穷人有的累死了，活着的也缺吃少穿，这就是功吗？多亏毛主席共产党把我们穷人救了出来。地主欠下了我们算不清的账，数不尽的仇。可是党内最大的走资派却胡说什么“农民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”我听到气得直咬牙帮骨，肺都气炸了。这个大坏蛋，真是心狠，意毒，豺狼性。我们要把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身。
