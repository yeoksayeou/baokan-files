The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Bai Jia Zhuang Middle School were thrilled and enthusiastically cheered when they heard Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution. Chairman Mao's latest directives are the greatest trust, encouragement, and urging from our great leader to the revolutionary teachers and students. Everyone expressed their determination to immediately follow the directives, word for word, sentence for sentence.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, Bai Jia Zhuang Middle School achieved revolutionary unity based on teaching classes in early May and established a revolutionary committee with the "three-in-one combination." Subsequently, the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school were full of vigor and high morale, engaging in the struggle of criticism and revolutionizing education. Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," the revolutionary teachers and students carried out educational reforms, abolished the teaching research groups, and established company committees by grade to unify the leadership of the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, and to resume classes and make revolution. They also linked up with factories and rural areas, with teachers and students participating in one production labor session per week.

During the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students followed Chairman Mao's guidance on "training methods, which should promote a mass training movement of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," and implemented democratic teaching. Revolutionary youngsters boldly took to the lectern to teach. The revolutionary youngsters of Class 6, Grade 1, with the support and help of the People's Liberation Army and teachers, selected a few classmates to prepare lessons collectively. First, one student would explain, then everyone would discuss, and finally, the teacher would guide and summarize, achieving very good results. The revolutionary committee promoted this method throughout the school. So far, 149 students have taken to the lectern to teach. The greatest advantage of this method is that it can mobilize the enthusiasm of the students, inspire everyone to think, and make the teaching lively and vigorous.

Chairman Mao's latest directives are the guiding light for our educational revolution. Our proletarian revolutionary faction will definitely follow the course set by Chairman Mao, take "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, reform the old educational system, teaching guidelines, and methods, and forge a red and shining educational system that radiates the thoughts of Mao Zedong.

    最大信任　最大鼓舞　最大鞭策
    白家庄中学革命委员会
    北京市白家庄中学广大革命师生，当听到毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示的时候，群情振奋，热烈欢呼。毛主席的最新指示，是我们的伟大领袖对革命师生的最大信任，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。大家纷纷表示一定马上照办，字字照办，句句照办。
    白家庄中学在解放军的帮助下，五月初就实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合，建立了“三结合”的革命委员会。接着，全校革命师生意气风发，斗志昂扬，投入大批判和复课闹革命的斗争。革命师生遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，进行了教育改革，取消了教研组，按年级建立了连委会，统一领导学校的斗批改和复课闹革命；并且与工厂、农村挂钩，师生每周参加一次生产劳动。
    在复课闹革命中，广大革命师生遵照毛主席“练兵方法，应开展官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的群众练兵运动”的教导，实行民主教学，革命小将大胆走上讲台上课。初一（六）班的革命小将，在解放军和教师的支持和帮助下，选出了几个同学集体备课。先由一个同学讲解，然后大家讨论，最后由教师辅导、总结，取得了很好的效果。革命委员会在全校推广了这种做法，到目前为止，全校已有一百四十九名学生走上讲台讲课。这种方法最大的好处是能够调动学生的积极性，启发人人动脑筋思考，使教学生气勃勃。
  毛主席的最新指示，是我们进行教育革命的指路明灯。我们的无产阶级革命派，一定沿着毛主席指引的航向，以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底批判修正主义教育路线，改革旧的教育制度、教学方针、方法，闯出一个红彤彤的闪耀毛泽东思想光辉的教育制度来。
