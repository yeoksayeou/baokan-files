Our great leader Chairman Mao, during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, gave a series of extremely important instructions on the current situation and tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao emphasized: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of an excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. No mass movement in the past has been as extensive and deep as this one."

Chairman Mao's analysis of the situation is the most accurate and inspiring summary of the magnificent mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. Only by understanding the situation in this way can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, correctly define our struggle tasks, and avoid losing our way and going astray.

As Chairman Mao pointed out, this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has truly mobilized the masses. Look at today's China: every factory, every village, every office, every school, and every military unit are all discussing the issues of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Except for traitors, spies, die-hard anti-party elements within the party, and the ghosts and monsters in society (those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed), everyone is concerned about national affairs, the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship, and the future of the Chinese people and the people of the world. A significant phenomenon is that even within families, between fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, even children in their teens and elderly women with white hair, all participate in the debates. It can be said with pride that this is unprecedented. Only our Chairman Mao has such great courage, such profound Marxist-Leninist wisdom, to dare to trust the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' initiative, and mobilize the masses to launch such a massive revolutionary mass movement that shakes the whole of China and the world.

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been an unprecedented movement to popularize and spread Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has been more closely combined with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. A new era has begun where the laboring people directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Hundreds of millions of laboring people support Mao Zedong Thought, which is not only a good situation in China but also in the world. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the necessity for every revolutionary's struggle and life. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries across the country, with "criticizing the self and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, have carried out a mass self-education movement, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of new revolutionary talents have emerged. The broad masses learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is a matter of great significance. Fundamentally, it is the fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism from usurping the leadership of the party and the state, to prevent capitalist restoration, and to ensure that our proletarian dictatorship socialist state does not change color.

The clique of capitalist roaders within the party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, has been exposed by the revolutionary masses and is now being thoroughly and deeply criticized theoretically, politically, and ideologically. The capitalist headquarters within the party has been destroyed. This has eliminated a major hidden danger within the party. To assess the situation, one must compare. Last year, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents still had considerable strength. Today, after just over a year, their counter-revolutionary line has collapsed. Their plot to usurp the party's leadership and carry out capitalist restoration has been thoroughly smashed.

Under the personal call of our great commander, a new upsurge of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and struggle-criticism-transformation is surging across the country. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary mass organizations have broadly united politically, ideologically, and organizationally. A large number of revolutionary cadres have stood up and united with the revolutionary masses, forming a new relationship between proletarian cadres and the masses. Revolutionary criticism is beginning to combine with the struggle-criticism-transformation within each unit. Under the call of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a powerful mass movement of proletarian educational revolution has begun.

The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved a decisive great victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved a decisive great victory.

Chairman Mao has said: "Never before have we seen the people so spirited, so full of fighting spirit, and so full of vigor. The exploiting classes have completely sunk into the vast ocean of the laboring masses; they have to change even if they do not want to. Those who insist on dying with a granite head to see God will certainly exist, but that is of no consequence. All decayed ideologies and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are crumbling day by day. It will still take time to thoroughly sweep away these rubbish; but the trend of their collapse is already definite."

Chairman Mao's vivid words are also the best description of the current situation of the Cultural Revolution.

To assess the situation, one must grasp the essence and mainstream of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everything has a mainstream and a sidestream. If we cannot see the mainstream, cannot see the essential aspects, but only see the sidestream, only see certain phenomena, then we will lose our way and fall into the enemy's trap. This point must be constantly kept in mind.

Some places seemed chaotic for a while, but in fact, it was the enemy who was in chaos, and the masses were tempered. When we assess the situation, we must correctly view this temporary "chaos." After a period of chaos, contradictions are fully exposed, class enemies are more exposed, and the correct and incorrect sides are fully revealed, making it possible to solve problems more thoroughly. From the perspective of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, such "chaos" is mainly about defeating the enemy, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party, making them fall into disarray. Such "chaos" is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In this excellent situation, we must be soberly aware of a handful of class enemies and anticipate possible twists and turns. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is long-term, complex, and sharp. Class struggle will not extinguish, and class enemies will not lay down their weapons voluntarily. The law of struggle is often that the better the situation, the closer the enemy is to complete annihilation, the more they will struggle desperately and try every means to sabotage the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter must not relax vigilance.

The broad masses of workers and peasants, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have made indelible contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to criticize the self and repudiate revisionism, to support the army and love the people, to seize revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and to do a better job in all aspects. Open your eyes to the future. We can confidently say that the overall situation will become even better and better.

    形势比以往任何时候都好
    任立新
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，在视察华北、中南和华东地区时，对当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势和任务，作了一系列极为重要的指示。
    毛主席强调指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”
    毛主席对形势的这种分析，是一年多来波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的最准确、最鼓舞人心的总结。我们只有这样认识形势，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，正确地规定自己的斗争任务，才不至于迷失方向，走到邪路上去。
    正如毛主席所指出的，这次无产阶级文化大革命，真正把群众发动起来了。请看今日之中国，一切工厂，一切农村，一切机关，一切学校，一切部队，到处都在讨论无产阶级文化大革命的问题。除了叛徒、特务、顽固不化的党内走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神（即没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右）以外，大家都在关心国家大事，关心无产阶级政权的巩固，关心我国人民和世界人民的前途和未来。一个有意义的现象是，甚至在家庭内部，父子之间，兄弟姐妹之间，夫妻之间，连十几岁的娃娃和白发苍苍的老太太，都参加了辩论。可以无愧地说，这是前无古人的。只有我们的毛主席，有这样伟大的气魄，有这样深刻的马克思列宁主义的智慧，才敢于这样相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，放手发动群众，敢于掀起这样规模的震动全中国和全世界的革命群众运动。
    一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一次史无前例的大普及、大传播的运动。毛泽东思想同亿万革命群众更广泛地结合起来了。一个劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新纪元开始了。亿万劳动人民拥护毛泽东思想，这不仅在中国，而且在全世界也是大好形势。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，成了每一个革命者斗争和生活的必需。全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，以“斗私，批修”为纲，开展了群众性的自我教育运动，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，涌现了大批的新的革命人材。广大群众学习和运用毛泽东思想这一件大事，具有深远的意义。从根本上说来，这是防止修正主义篡夺党和国家的领导，防止资本主义复辟，使我们无产阶级专政的社会主义国家不改变颜色的最根本的保证。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，被革命群众揪了出来，正在从理论上、政治上、思想上受到彻底的深刻的批判。党内的资产阶级司令部被摧毁了。这就消除了党内的一个大隐患。看形势，要比较地来看。去年，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，还是有相当实力的。今天，仅仅过了一年多的时间，他们的反革命阵线已经土崩瓦解了。他们妄图篡夺党的领导、实行资本主义复辟的阴谋被彻底粉碎了。
    在我们伟大统帅的亲自号召下，一个革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的三结合和斗批改的新高潮，正在全国范围内蓬蓬勃勃地兴起。在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，革命的群众组织广泛地从政治上、思想上、组织上联合起来了。大批革命干部站了出来，同革命群众结合在一起，正在形成崭新的无产阶级的干部同群众的关系。革命的大批判，正在开始同本单位的斗批改结合起来。在毛主席的最新指示的号召下，一个声势浩大的无产阶级教育革命的群众运动开始了。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的伟大胜利。无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的伟大胜利。
    毛主席说过：“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变。至死不变、愿意带着花冈岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的，那也无关大局。一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”
    毛主席的这段生动的话，也是对当前文化大革命形势再好不过的描绘。
    看形势，必须抓住无产阶级文化大革命的本质和主流。任何事情，总是有主流和支流的。假如我们看不清楚主流，看不清本质的方面，而只看到支流，只看到某些现象，那就会迷失方向，就上了敌人的大当。这一点，必须时刻引起我们的注意。
    有些地方前一段好象很乱，其实那是乱了敌人，锻炼了群众。我们看形势，就要正确地看待这种暂时的“乱”。乱了一下，矛盾充分暴露了，阶级敌人更加暴露了，正确方面与错误方面也充分展现了，问题反而可以解决得更彻底。用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的观点来看，这样的“乱”，主要是把敌人，把党内一小撮走资派，把党内的资产阶级代表人物打得落花流水，把他们打乱了。这样的“乱”，是无产阶级文化大革命的大胜利。
    在大好形势下，我们要清醒地看到一小撮阶级敌人，要预计到可能的曲折。在无产阶级专政下，无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，仍然是长期的、复杂的、尖锐的。阶级斗争不会熄灭，阶级敌人也不会自动放下武器。斗争的规律往往是，形势越是大好，敌人越是面临彻底覆灭的命运，他们就越要垂死挣扎，千方百计地破坏文化大革命的伟大成果。每个无产阶级革命战士，务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。
    广大工农群众、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部和革命知识分子，在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，建立了不可磨灭的功绩。我们应当坚决响应毛主席的号召，要斗私、批修，要拥军爱民，要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好。放开眼界看未来。我们可以满怀信心地说，整个形势将会变得更好，越来越好。
