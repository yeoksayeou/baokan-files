	Afterword

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The work of ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and meticulous task. One cannot expect to change people's ideological consciousness, which has been formed over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings."

	In the process of liberating cadres, it is inevitable that some cadres will have fluctuations in their thinking. Some cadres who have made mistakes may not understand immediately and should be given time to think more. If they understand for a moment but encounter some issues and then do not understand, we should patiently wait. If one sees that cadres who have made mistakes have fluctuations in their thinking and then loses confidence in them, or even discriminates against them, that is wrong.

	Allowing cadres to have fluctuations in their thinking does not mean we can passively wait. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat should adopt an active and enthusiastic attitude, do more patient and meticulous ideological work, help cadres recognize and correct their mistakes, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only in this way can we truly unite the majority of cadres, which is beneficial for achieving great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, for seizing the revolution, promoting production, work, and preparedness for war.

    编后
    毛主席教导我们：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”
    在解放干部的过程中，干部思想出现一些反复，这是难免的。有一些犯错误的干部一时想不通，就应该给他们时间，让他们多想一想。一时想通了，遇到一些事又想不通，也要耐心等待。如果一看到犯错误的干部思想有反复，就对他们失去信心，甚至歧视他们，那是不对的。
    允许干部思想有反复，绝不意味着可以消极等待。无产阶级革命派要采取积极而热情的态度，多做耐心的、细致的思想工作，帮助干部认识错误，改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线一边来。这样，才能真正团结干部的大多数，以利于实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，以利于抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备。
