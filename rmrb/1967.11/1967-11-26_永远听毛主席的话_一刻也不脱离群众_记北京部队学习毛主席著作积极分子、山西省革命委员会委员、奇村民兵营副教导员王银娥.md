The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories.

From the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, a large number of revolutionary "little people" have emerged. After their positions have changed, will they always follow Chairman Mao, always stay among the masses, be diligent and honest public servants and ordinary people, or will they stand above the masses, put on airs, seek special treatment, and become officials and masters? This is a major issue facing them.

Wang Yinyu, deputy political instructor of the militia camp in Qicun, Shanxi Province, and a member of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, follows Chairman Mao's great teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common person." After being elected as a member of the district and county revolutionary committees and the provincial revolutionary committee, she has never left the masses for a moment and has maintained the character of a laborer and a revolutionary pioneer.

In the Face of New Severe Tests

On May 10, the sun was shining brightly. At the village entrance and on the main street of Qicun, thousands of people lined up, looking towards the road to the county seat, their hearts filled with great excitement, waiting for Wang Yinyu, who had just returned from Chairman Mao's side.

Wang Yinyu participated in the Shanxi delegation to Beijing for study. Today, she returned home. During her time in Beijing, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao received the Shanxi delegation on May 1 at Tiananmen Gate and shook hands with and took photos with all the members of the delegation. This news spread to Qicun and immediately caused a sensation throughout the village and the commune. Today, hearing that Wang Yinyu had returned, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and militia were even more overjoyed and flocked from all directions. Everyone wanted to be the first to see Wang Yinyu, who had met Chairman Mao, to be the first to hear her convey the great news of Chairman Mao's excellent health, and to be the first to shake the hand that had shaken Chairman Mao's.

At this moment, some people were also discussing: "Half a pound of white flour and eight ounces of yeast, Yinyu has really made it this time, I wonder if she still recognizes us!" Others said: "She is a member of the provincial committee now, who knows when she will be transferred to the provincial or county seat to work."

People's discussions about Wang Yinyu are understandable. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she led the rebellion, bravely fought, and suffered various persecutions from the bourgeois reactionary line. Thousands of big-character posters attacking her did not scare her; four days of struggle sessions did not scare her; being followed and surveilled did not scare her. She had Chairman Mao in her heart, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, uniting and relying on the broad masses, from an eight-person combat team to the great unity of revolutionary masses throughout the village, achieving one victory after another. Now, she has grown from a poor child of a poor family into a leader supported by the masses, from an ordinary militia cadre to a member of the provincial revolutionary committee elected by the masses. This is a great change. People are very concerned: Can Yinyu pass this severe test? Can she give a satisfactory answer to the question of "where to go after becoming a committee member"?

Wang Yinyu's actions on the first day of her return to the village were the opposite of some people's discussions: she was still wearing her faded blue jacket, carrying her yellow bag with Chairman Mao's works, and during her stay in Beijing for dozens of days, her attire had not changed at all. She was still the same as when she returned from other places, not drying her sweat, not going home, but busy visiting poor and lower-middle peasants. She went from house to house conveying the great news of Chairman Mao receiving the Shanxi delegation and asked about everything from firewood, rice, oil, and salt to the three great revolutionary struggles. She still had her old habits, and despite working late into the night that day, the next morning, as soon as it was light, she was the first to go to the fields to work.

Gradually, people were reassured: "Yinyu is still one of us farmers; except that her thoughts are higher than ours, everything else is the same, she hasn't changed!"

In fact, Wang Yinyu had changed. Chairman Mao said: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people." "We must make sure that our comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, and unassuming attitude, and we must make sure that our comrades continue to maintain a spirit of hard struggle." Chairman Mao's great teachings made her more humble, more modest, her spiritual realm higher, and her heart closer to the masses.

This year on May 1, when Chairman Mao received the Shanxi delegation at Tiananmen Gate, Chen Yonggui comrade pulled Wang Yinyu and the "Iron Girl" of Dazhai, Jia Xiu Lan, to his side. When taking photos, because they had to take a group photo with the Shanghai delegation, the positions moved a bit, and Wang Yinyu happened to stand next to Chairman Mao. She felt this was the greatest happiness and greatest honor of her life. At this most happiest moment, she thought of Chen Yonggui comrade holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, making great contributions to the revolution, and should be closer to Chairman Mao, so she voluntarily gave her position to Chen Yonggui comrade. Chen Yonggui comrade repeatedly declined, but everyone insisted that he stand next to Chairman Mao.

Once, the small car from the military sub-district was returning to the headquarters from Qicun, and Wang Yinyu also needed to go to the city for a meeting, which was convenient. If she took the car, the 45-mile journey would be over in an instant; the driver would definitely take her. However, she excused herself, saying she still had some things to take care of, and politely declined. In the end, she rode her bicycle into the city. Isn't it okay for a provincial committee member to take a small car for official business? In her view, taking a small car cannot be universally regarded as bourgeois thinking; the question is about one's attitude towards taking a small car. If a person, after taking power, thinks more about comfort, they will inevitably think less about revolution, going back and forth in cars all day, and without a car, they can't walk. If this continues, what will happen? Isn't this giving the green light to bourgeois thinking?

Another time, the provincial military region notified her to go to Taiyuan for a meeting. Before leaving, she carried a cold steamed bun in her chest and only brought nine cents of pocket money. Nine cents, in the eyes of some people, is insignificant, not enough to go out, let alone go to the provincial city. She, however, cherished every drop of the laborers' sweat. Except for buying a thimble for two cents to help the army soldiers sew quilts and a hairband for one cent for her sister, she still had six cents left. Did she not have money? No. This year, she went out for meetings more often, and the state gave her daily subsidies, but she bought many copies of Chairman Mao's works, portraits of Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao badges to give to the people. Almost all the militia in the village had received her precious gifts. Who wouldn't be moved by her noble character! She was not like some people who, after doing a little work, thought they were great, loved to boast, afraid that others wouldn't know, and competed for the limelight, space, and seats, gesturing and lecturing others. She often said: "Honor is given by Chairman Mao, achievements are created by the masses, serving the people is my duty." Therefore, she rarely took the certificates of merit given by her superiors home; she never hung the photos taken by reporters; she did many good deeds but never publicized them.

Do not think these are trivial, mundane "small matters." A person being hit by a sugar-coated bullet, degenerating, and ultimately being despised by the people, is precisely because of these "small matters" that a breach was opened; while the iron wall of anti-revisionism and anti-modern revisionism in one's mind is precisely built up brick by brick through such unremitting efforts!

Being an Ordinary Farmer

Chairman Mao said: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor.... This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism."

Wang Yinyu comrade deeply understands and practices Chairman Mao's teachings. She knows: laziness is the beginning of degeneration, not working means leaving the masses; no matter how much it changes, the character of a laborer cannot change, no matter how busy, one must participate in collective production labor. Therefore, after entering the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre, she did not reduce her participation in collective production labor but increased it. She did not ask about the difficulty of the work, did not care about the weather, did not calculate the work points, and was always with the masses, sweating together. Whatever hard, heavy, dirty, or difficult work, she was always at the forefront.

This year in May, cotton aphids appeared, and if not treated urgently, the 700-plus mu of cotton would suffer serious losses. However, this area lacked experience in growing cotton, and due to not mastering the technology of spraying pesticides, some community members were poisoned during spraying, and the masses had a sense of difficulty. At this time, Wang Yinyu took the lead, leading other cadres, on the one hand, propagating Chairman Mao's teaching of "strategically, we must despise all enemies; tactically, we must take all enemies seriously" to everyone, on the other hand, personally leading the spraying. Under their influence, the masses dispelled their concerns and actively joined the pest control battle, thus ensuring the normal growth of the cotton seedlings.

The more one participates in collective production labor, the closer one's heart is to the masses; the more one sweats, the deeper one's class feelings are with the masses. In collective production labor, Wang Yinyu was always where it was difficult, where it was hard, and at every critical moment, she was among the masses, leading the masses forward.

One night in August, Wang Yinyu comrade had just finished a meeting and returned home when she suddenly heard an emergency flood prevention notice on the radio. She knew that the dry river to the west of the village had no rain or water, a little rain or water, a lot of rain or water, and since the riverbed was higher than the farmland, if the dike broke, thousands of mu of crops would be flooded. She immediately picked up her tools and rushed to the front line of flood prevention. At this time, the rain was pouring, the sky was pitch black, and the river water was rising rapidly. Wang Yinyu, together with the "supporting agriculture" troops stationed in the village, led the militia to jump into the river, press tree branches, and fill the embankment, guiding the water into the irrigation canal. The north in August is relatively cool, plus the wind and rain, the people working in the water were shivering from the cold.

"Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

"Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)."

These two quotations from Chairman Mao are battle cries, spiritual atomic bombs with unlimited power. Wang Yinyu comrade thought of these two shining quotations from Chairman Mao and immediately became hot-blooded and full of energy. Under Wang Yinyu's leadership, more than 300 soldiers, militia, and community members, both in the water and on the shore, together loudly recited these two quotations. This voice shook the heavens and the earth. People fought until the next day at ten o'clock, still full of spirit and fighting spirit. Wang Yinyu comrade fought in the water for more than five hours, sometimes fainting in the water, being helped up, but she still fought tenaciously. People praised: Yinyu has given everything for everyone.

Being the Heart of the Masses

Wang Yinyu comrade cares for the masses and is considerate of her comrades. She warms the hearts of her class brothers with her fiery proletarian feelings. The masses all like her, praise her, and say she is the "good daughter of the poor and lower-middle peasants" and the "confidant of the militia."

Chairman Mao said: "Solve the problems of the masses' clothing, food, housing, firewood, rice, oil, salt, illness, and hygiene. In short, all the practical problems of the masses' lives are problems that we should pay attention to." Wang Yinyu keeps Chairman Mao's teachings in mind and implements them in her actions.

When autumn turns to winter, she thinks of those poor and lower-middle peasants and bachelors: have they mended their cotton clothes? Have they sealed their windows? Every time a festival comes, she thinks of the military dependents and martyrs' dependents: do they lack firewood and rice? Do they lack oil and salt? When the army comes to the village to "support agriculture," she always remembers the soldiers' clothes: are they dirty? Have they been washed? Are they torn? Have they been mended? She often takes cadres and militia to visit every household, helping them bit by bit.

Militia camp activist Zhou Dezhen, who suffered from severe arthritis, could not move his limbs. Wang Yinyu took her comrade's pain as her own, took her comrade's difficulties as her own, sought doctors everywhere, and bought medicine with her hard-earned money to send to her. She encouraged Zhou Dezhen to fight the disease with Mao Zedong Thought and introduced the story of Shen Yuying, an activist from Hongjin Village, Jiangsu Province, who fought against the disease, greatly boosting Zhou Dezhen's courage to overcome the disease.

As a revolutionary cadre, is it enough to just care about the masses' eating and dressing problems? Chairman Mao said: "Mastering ideological education is the key link to uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle." Wang Yinyu follows Chairman Mao's teachings and pays special attention to propagating Mao Zedong Thought. She is determined to let every poor and lower-middle peasant and militia member master Mao Zedong Thought and take big strides on the road of ideological revolution.

Militia cadre Hou Zhiming, a junior high school graduate, was not content with agricultural production, wanted to make a name for himself, and had a personal "May Plan." Wang Yinyu had tried to persuade him with kind words, but who would have thought he wrote in his diary: "The candy seller's mouth is sweet, but my heart is as hard as iron and won't be fooled." Seeing that she couldn't persuade him after several attempts, Wang Yinyu wanted to give him a good scolding. However, she thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must understand that ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and meticulous task, and we cannot expect to change people's ideological consciousness, which has been formed over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings." She patiently helped Hou Zhiming. Once, Wang Yinyu was digging a well, and Hou Zhiming was repairing a canal. Whenever they rested, Wang Yinyu would bring hot water to Hou Zhiming. Another time, Wang Yinyu saw Hou Zhiming carrying corn to grind flour and quietly went to help. Gradually, Hou Zhiming understood Wang Yinyu better. Wang Yinyu also gave Hou Zhiming two precious books, "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," and studied Mao Zedong Thought with him, inspiring him to use the spirit of Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune, compare and examine himself, fight against "selfishness," and establish "public spirit." At the militia camp's meeting to share experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works, Hou Zhiming dug out his selfishness, tore up the "May Plan," and read out his plan to study Chairman Mao's works. Now, he no longer wants to be the "head" of this or that, but is determined to take root in the countryside, seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

How many comrades have been helped by Wang Yinyu, not just Hou Zhiming! She is happy when her comrades make progress and helps when her comrades fall behind. In her view, helping one class brother more is adding one more strength for the revolution.

Wang Yinyu treats the process of helping the masses as a process of learning from the masses and remolding herself. Militia squad leader Jia Xingwang, a son of poor and lower-middle peasants, once wanted to quit because a few militia cadres in his squad were not united. At that time, Wang Yinyu thought: Jia Xingwang used to listen to my words, now that I have entered the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre, a few words of criticism from me should solve the problem. Who would have thought that after she criticized him, Jia Xingwang retorted, and after talking several times, they still couldn't reach an agreement. During the fourth heart-to-heart talk, Wang Yinyu, with bitterness leading to bitterness, talked and talked until both cried. Wang Yinyu said very sincerely: "In the old society, we were all bitter gourds on the same vine, heart to heart; now, under Chairman Mao's leadership, why can't we be even more united for the revolution?" Jia Xingwang was very moved and later told others: "Now I truly understand Wang Yinyu." He, with Wang Yinyu's correct attitude towards him, united with other militia cadres, and their relationships gradually improved.

Through this incident, Wang Yinyu realized an important truth: after one's position changes, the attitude of treating people equally must not change. At any time, one must, as Chairman Mao taught, have extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people, not regard oneself as an educator, but always be a student of the masses, learning and helping each other with the masses.

Being Brave in Fighting Selfishness

Chairman Mao teaches us: fight selfishness, criticize revisionism.

Wang Yinyu comrade has always consciously fought selfishness and established public spirit. She feels that the more fiercely she fights selfishness, the closer she follows Chairman Mao; the deeper she fights selfishness, the closer she is to the masses.

Chairman Mao said: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses for a moment." Wang Yinyu follows Chairman Mao's great teachings and works hard on "never leaving the masses for a moment," checking herself at all times, comparing herself in everything, and practicing it bit by bit.

In the past, when she went out wearing patched clothes, her face would turn red. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on hard struggle, she realized that if she pursued "good looks" and paid attention to her attire, she would open a door to bourgeois hedonism and would gradually forget the masses and leave them. She thought: face turning red means her heart is not red, and if her heart is red, her face will not turn red; she is not afraid of torn clothes, but afraid of torn thoughts. From then on, she remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly "rebelled" in her mind, fought selfishness and established public spirit, and maintained the character of a laborer.

Wang Yinyu comrade, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "attack is the main means to destroy the enemy," fiercely grasped the "selfishness" "momentary thought," actively launched an attack on "selfishness," let "public spirit" occupy the ideological battlefield, and cared for the masses everywhere, helped the masses, took her comrades' joy as her own joy, and took her comrades' happiness as her own happiness.

During a trip out for a meeting, one evening, she watched a movie. Wang Yinyu, in order to let the cook go to watch the movie, voluntarily went to the canteen to help the cook wash dishes and clean up. After a while, she thought: it's better to watch the movie first and then do it. This thought just flashed by, and she immediately felt it was "selfishness" at work, not having wholehearted enthusiasm for her comrades, not being extremely responsible for her work. She firmly grasped this "momentary thought," actively attacked, insisted on washing the dishes, cleaned the canteen and kitchen, and then went to watch the movie. Wang Yinyu comrade is like this, never letting go of a hint of selfishness, becoming more and more concerned about the masses. Wherever she goes, good deeds follow, and many people praise: "Yinyu is truly a model of learning from Chairman Mao's works, a comrade like Lei Feng."

Wang Yinyu comrade's fighting selfishness and establishing public spirit in dealing with the masses' issues is not only about "correcting the direction in small matters," but also about finding problems when she thinks there are none.

Once, Wang Yinyu went to the militia's 16th squad she was in to attend a meeting. She asked the militia for their opinions about her, but no one could come up with anything. On her way home, she thought: why can't everyone come up with any opinions? The main reason is that recently she has been more active upstairs and less active in her own team and squad. From then on, she not only did a good job in the brigade and militia camp but also often went deep into the production teams and militia squads and classes, studying, working, and having heart-to-heart talks with the militia and community members, and her relationship with the masses became closer and closer.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently issued a call: "We must solve the problem of superior-subordinate relations well, and do a good job in the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots level to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses more on matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." After studying Chairman Mao's great teachings, Wang Yinyu comrade further realized the great strategic significance of doing a good job in superior-subordinate relations and cadre-mass relations. She resolutely implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, takes "fighting selfishness, criticizing revisionism" as the key, works hard on remolding her worldview, and works hard on correctly treating the masses' issues, doing a good job in never leaving the masses for a moment, humbly learning from the masses, consulting with the masses on matters, being a lifelong student of the masses, a lifelong servant of the people, following the great leader Chairman Mao to do a lifelong revolution.

    永远听毛主席的话　一刻也不脱离群众
    ——记北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、山西省革命委员会委员、奇村民兵营副教导员王银娥
    无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    从两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中冲杀出来的一大批革命的“小人物”，当地位发生变化以后，是永远紧跟毛主席，永远深入于群众之中，做一个勤勤恳恳的人民勤务员和普通的老百姓，还是高踞于群众之上，摆架子，搞特殊，当官做老爷？这是摆在面前的重大课题。
    山西省忻县奇村民兵营副教导员王银娥同志，遵循毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导，在被选为专区和县革命委员会常委、省革命委员会委员以后，一刻也不脱离群众，保持了劳动人民和革命闯将的本色。
    在新的严峻考验面前
    五月十日，阳光灿烂。奇村村头和大街上，数千名群众排着队，眼望着通往县城的公路，怀着十分激动的心情，等候从毛主席身边归来的王银娥。
    王银娥参加山西省赴京学习代表团，今天到家。在北京期间，我们日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席，“五一”节在天安门城楼上接见了山西代表团，并同代表团全体同志握了手，照了相。这个消息传到奇村，立刻轰动了全村、全公社。今天，听说王银娥回来了，广大贫下中农和民兵更是欢喜雀跃，不由得从四面八方赶来。大家都想第一个看到见过毛主席的王银娥，都想第一个听到她传达毛主席身体非常非常健康的特大喜讯，都想第一个握着她与毛主席握过的手。
    就在这个时候，也有一些人在议论：“半斤白面八两肥（酵母），银娥这下可发了，不知还认识咱不！”还有的说：“人家是省委员了，不定那天要调到省城、县城去工作了。”
    人们对王银娥同志的这种议论是可以理解的。无产阶级文化大革命中，她带头造反，勇敢冲杀，曾遭到了资产阶级反动路线的种种迫害。上千张的大字报围攻，她不怕；连续四天的揪斗，她不怕；跟踪盯梢，她更不怕。她心中有毛主席，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，依靠和团结广大群众，从八个人的战斗队到全村革命群众大联合，取得了一个又一个胜利。现在，她由一个贫苦家庭出身的穷孩子成长为群众拥护的“带头人”，由一个普普通通的民兵干部，被群众推选为省革命委员会的委员。这是一个很大的变化。人们十分关心：银娥能不能经受住这场严峻的考验，能不能在这张“当了委员向何处去”的考卷上作出令人满意的答案？
    王银娥回村第一天的行动，和有些人的议论恰恰相反：她还是穿着那件褪了色的蓝布衫，挂着装有毛主席著作的黄挂包，在北京几十天，她身上的装束没有添一丝一缕。她还和往常从外地归来时一样，汗不干，家不回，就忙着走访贫下中农。她挨家挨户传达毛主席接见山西代表的特大喜讯。并从柴米油盐一直问到三大革命斗争。她还是老习惯，尽管当天夜里忙工作忙到深夜，第二天天一亮，下地劳动又走在社员前头。
    逐渐地，人们放心了：“银娥还是咱庄稼人，她除了思想比咱高，什么都和咱一样，没变！”
    其实，王银娥还是变了。毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”毛主席的伟大教导，使她变得更谦逊了，更朴素了，精神境界更高了，和群众的心贴得更紧了。
    今年“五一”节，毛主席在天安门城楼上接见山西代表团时，陈永贵同志把王银娥和大寨“铁姑娘”贾秀兰拉到身旁。照相时，因为要和上海代表团一起合影，位置移动了一下，王银娥正好站到了毛主席身边。她感到这是一生中最大的幸福、最大的光荣。在这最最幸福的时刻，她想到陈永贵同志毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，对革命贡献大，应该靠毛主席更近些，因此，她主动把自己的位置让给陈永贵同志。陈永贵同志再三谦让，大家仍硬要他站在毛主席身边。
    一次，军分区的小汽车从奇村回机关，王银娥也要进城开会，正好顺路。如果坐车，四十五里路眨眼就到；司机也一定要捎上她走。但是，她借故还有事没有办妥，婉言谢绝，最后骑自行车进城了。难道当了省的委员有公事坐小汽车也不可以吗？在她看来，坐小汽车不能一律看成是资产阶级思想，问题是看你对坐小汽车的态度。如果一个人当权以后，舒服想得多了，革命必然就想得少了，整日里车来车去，没车就不能走路，那么发展下去竟会怎样？这不是为资产阶级思想开绿灯吗？
    还有一次，省军区通知她去太原开会。临行前，她怀里揣了个凉窝窝头，身边只带了九分零花钱。九分钱，在一些人的眼里是微不足道的，是不能出门的，更不消说是进省城了。她却非常珍惜劳动人民的点滴汗水。九分钱除帮助部队战士缝被子时用二分钱买了个顶针，用一分钱给妹妹买了一根头绳外，还剩六分。是她没有钱吗？不是。今年她外出开会时间较多，国家每天都给她补助，她却买了许多毛主席著作、毛主席像和毛主席像章，送给群众。全村绝大多数民兵都收到过她的珍贵礼品。谁不为她这种高尚品德所感动！她更不象某些人，出了一点力就觉得了不起，喜欢自吹，生怕人家不知道，到处争镜头，争版面，争席位，指手划脚，好为人师。她经常说：“荣誉是毛主席给的，成绩是群众创造的，当人民勤务员，好好地为人民服务，这是我的本分。”因此，上级给她发的奖状，她很少往家里拿，从不往外挂；记者给她拍的照片，她从不往外挂；她做了大量的好事，从不对外声张。
    千万不要以为这些是细微末节、平常琐碎的“小事”。一个人被糖衣炮弹所打中，蜕化变质，最后遭到人民的唾弃，正是从这些“小事”上被打开缺口的；而思想上反修防修的铜墙铁壁，也正是靠这种不倦的努力，一砖一瓦建设起来的啊！
    当普通的庄稼人
    毛主席说：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。……这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    王银娥同志对毛主席这一教导，认真领会，身体力行。她懂得：懒，就是变质的开始，不劳动，必然要脱离群众；千变万变，劳动人民的本色不能变，不管多忙，也要参加集体生产劳动。因此，她进入革命三结合的领导班子以后，参加集体生产劳动不是差了，而是更好了。她劳动不问活计轻重，干活不论天气好坏，出勤不计工分多少，什么时候都和群众干在一起，汗水流在一起。什么苦活、重活、脏活、难活，她都是打头阵。
    今年五月，棉花生了蚜虫，不紧急除治，七百多亩棉花将遭到严重损失。但是这一带种棉花还缺乏经验，由于没有掌握好喷洒药剂的技术，个别社员在喷药时中了毒，群众中产生了畏难情绪。这时，王银娥挺身而出，带领其他干部，一面向大家宣传毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，一面亲自带头喷药。在他们的带动下，群众打消了顾虑，积极投入到灭虫斗争中去，从而保证了棉苗的正常生长。
    多参加一次集体生产劳动，和群众的心就靠近一分；多出一身汗，和群众的阶级感情就加深一层。在集体生产劳动中，王银娥总是那里艰巨到那里，那里困难到那里，每当关键时刻，她总是出现在群众之中，率领群众前进。
    今年八月的一个深夜，王银娥同志刚开完会，回到家里，突然听到广播里传来了防洪的紧急通知。她知道，村西头那条干河是没雨没水，小雨小水，大雨大水，加之河床比庄稼地高，要是堤坝决口，几千亩庄稼将会被淹没，她马上拿起工具，带头奔赴防洪第一线。这时，雨下得正大，天黑得伸手不见五指，河水一个劲地上涨。王银娥同驻本村的“支农”部队一起，带领民兵们毅然跳进河里，压树枝，填土方，把水引到灌溉渠里。北方八月的凌晨是比较凉的，加上刮风下雨，在水中作业的人们，冷得发抖。
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    “发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”
    毛主席这两条语录是战斗的进军号，是威力无穷的精神原子弹。王银娥同志想起毛主席这两条金光闪闪的语录，立刻热血沸腾，干劲倍增。在王银娥的带领下，水中岸上，三百多名解放军战士、民兵和社员，一起高声朗诵这两条语录。这声音，震撼着天地。人们战斗到次日十点，依然精神焕发，斗志昂扬。王银娥同志在水中连续战斗了五个多小时，有时晕倒在水里，被人扶起，她仍顽强战斗。人们称赞说：银娥为了大伙儿，什么都豁出来了。
    当群众的贴心人
    王银娥同志关心群众，体贴同志，她用火一般的无产阶级感情温暖着阶级弟兄的心。群众都亲近她，称赞她，说她是“贫下中农的好闺女”，“民兵的知心人”。
    毛主席说：“解决群众的穿衣问题，吃饭问题，住房问题，柴米油盐问题，疾病卫生问题，婚姻问题。总之，一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”王银娥把毛主席这一教导牢记在心上，落实在行动中。
    当秋去冬来的时候，她就想起那些贫下中农和单身汉，他们的棉衣缝好了没有？窗户糊严了没有？每逢节日，她就更想起军属、烈属柴米缺不缺？油盐短不短？解放军到村里来“支农”时，她总是惦记着战士们的衣服脏了洗了没有？衣服破了补了没有？她经常带着干部和民兵，挨家挨户登门访问，一点一滴地帮助。
    民兵营学习毛主席著作积极分子周德贞，得了严重的关节炎，四肢不能动弹。王银娥把同志的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，把同志的困难当作自己的困难，到处求师访医，把省吃俭用的钱买上药品送去。她鼓励周德贞用毛泽东思想和疾病作斗争，并介绍江苏洪泾大队学习毛主席著作积极分子沈玉英和疾病作斗争的故事，大大提高了周德贞战胜疾病的勇气。
    作为一个革命干部，仅仅关心群众的吃饱穿暖问题就够了吗？毛主席说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”王银娥遵循毛主席的教导，特别重视宣传毛泽东思想。她决心让每一个贫下中农和民兵都能掌握毛泽东思想，都能在思想革命化的道路上大踏步前进。
    基干民兵侯治明，是初中毕业生，不安心农业生产，想成名成家，还订有个人奋斗的“五月计划”。王银娥曾苦口婆心地开导过他，谁料他在日记上写道：“卖糖公公口儿甜，无奈我铁打心肠不受骗。”王银娥见三番五次说不动他，想狠狠地批评他一顿。但是，她想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”就耐心地帮助侯治明。一次，王银娥打井，侯治明在修渠。每逢休息时，王银娥就提开水给侯治明送去。还有一次，王银娥看见侯治明拿着玉米去磨面，便不声不响地走去帮忙。慢慢地，侯治明对王银娥更了解了。王银娥又送给侯治明《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两本宝书，并同他一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，启发他用张思德、白求恩的精神，对照检查自己，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。在民兵营召开的学习毛主席著作讲用会上，侯治明狠挖了自己的私心，撕掉了“五月计划”，宣读了学习毛主席著作计划。现在，他不再想当这个“家”、那个“家”了，决心在农村中扎根，认真地学习毛主席著作，积极地宣传毛泽东思想。
    受到过王银娥帮助的同志，何止侯治明一人！同志进步她高兴，同志落后她去帮。在她看来，多帮助一个阶级兄弟，就为革命多增加一份力量。
    王银娥把帮助群众的过程，当作学习群众的过程和改造自己的过程。民兵排长贾兴旺，是贫下中农子弟，一度因本排几个民兵干部不团结，想撂挑子不干。当时，王银娥想：贾兴旺过去比较听我的话，现在我进入了革命三结合的领导班子，我批评他几句准能解决问题。谁料她一批评，贾兴旺却顶撞起来，接着谈几次都谈不拢。第四次谈心时，王银娥以苦引苦，两人谈着谈着都哭了。王银娥非常诚恳地说：“在旧社会，我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，心连着心；现在，在毛主席的领导下，我们为了革命，为什么不能团结得更好呢？”贾兴旺很受感动，事后对别人说：“现在我才真正认识了王银娥。”他以王银娥对待自己的正确态度，团结其他民兵干部，互相间的关系逐渐好起来。
    通过这件事，使王银娥悟出了一个很重要的道理：地位变了以后，平等待人的态度决不能变。任何时候都要象毛主席教导的那样，对同志对人民极端的热忱，不以教育者自居，而要永远当群众的小学生，同群众互相学习，互相帮助。
    当勇于斗私的人
    毛主席教导我们：要斗私，批修。
    王银娥同志一贯自觉地破私立公。她体会到，斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧；斗私越深，和群众越亲。
    毛主席说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。王银娥遵循毛主席这一伟大教导，在“一刻也不脱离群众”上狠下功夫，时时检查，事事对照，一点一滴身体力行。
    过去，她穿打补钉的衣服上街时，脸就发红。学习毛主席的艰苦奋斗的教导以后，她认识到如果追求“好看”，讲究穿戴，就给资产阶级享乐思想打开了口子，就会慢慢地忘记群众，脱离群众。她想：脸红，正说明自己的心不红，心红了，脸也就不红了；不怕衣服破，只怕思想破。从此，她牢记毛主席的教导，不断地在自己头脑里进行“暴动”，破私立公，保持劳动人民的本色。
    王银娥同志遵照毛主席“进攻，是消灭敌人的主要手段”的教导，狠狠地抓住“私”字“一闪念”，主动向“私”字发起进攻，让“公”字占领思想阵地，处处关心群众，帮助群众，把同志的快乐当作自己的快乐，把同志的幸福当作自己的幸福。
    在一次外出开会期间，有一天晚上看电影，王银娥为了让炊事员能去看，就主动到食堂帮助炊事员洗刷碗筷，搞卫生。过了一会，她想：还是看完了电影再来干吧。这个念头刚一闪过，她马上感到这是“私”字作怪，对同志不是满腔热情，对工作不是极端负责任。她紧紧抓住这个“一闪念”，主动进攻，坚持洗完了碗筷，把食堂和伙房打扫干净以后，才去看电影。王银娥同志就是这样，从不放过半点私心，越来越关心群众。她走到那里，好事就做到那里，许多人夸奖说：“银娥真不愧是学习毛主席著作积极分子，真是雷锋式的好同志。”
    王银娥同志在对待群众问题上的破私立公，不只是注意“在小问题上端正大方向”，同时，在自己认为没有问题的时候，她越要去找问题。
    一次，王银娥到她所在的民兵十六排参加会议，她征求民兵对自己的意见，但是，谁也提不出什么。她在回家途中，边走边想：为什么大家提不出什么意见呢？主要是最近自己到上边活动多，回本队本排少了，群众对自己不够了解。从此以后，她不仅做好大队和民兵营的工作，而且经常深入到生产队和民兵排、班，同民兵和社员一起学习，一起劳动，一起谈心，和群众的关系越来越密切了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近发出号召：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”王银娥同志学习了毛主席这一伟大教导以后，进一步认识到搞好上下级关系和干群关系的伟大战略意义。她坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，在正确对待群众的问题上狠下功夫，做到一刻也不脱离群众，虚心向群众学习，遇事和群众商量，当一辈子群众的小学生，当一辈子人民的勤务员，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。

    王银娥和奇村的民兵们以解放军为榜样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，把毛泽东思想作为民兵建设的根本，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，在无产阶级文化大革命中，充分发挥民兵的作用，为人民立新功建新劳。这是她正在给民兵们上课。
