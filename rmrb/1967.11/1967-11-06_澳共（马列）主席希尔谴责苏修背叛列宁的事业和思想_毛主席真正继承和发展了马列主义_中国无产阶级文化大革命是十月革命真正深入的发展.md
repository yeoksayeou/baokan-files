	Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) Chairman Hill, in an article titled "China Upholds the Tradition of October (Revolution)," stated that Chairman Mao is the "genuine inheritor and developer of Marxism-Leninism," and the "defender of the October Revolution."

	The article, published in the November 2nd issue of *The Vanguard*, says: "This year, all revolutionaries will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the great October Revolution. Fifty years ago, the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Russia seized power. The central issue of the October Revolution was the armed seizure of power by the working class, the smashing of the capitalist state machine, and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat."

	The article points out that the October Revolution proved that Lenin's views were absolutely correct. However, the Soviet revisionists have betrayed Lenin's cause and thought.

	The article, discussing the "outline" recently put forward by the Soviet revisionist leadership on the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, says: "Only a complete traitor could come up with such a pathetic hodgepodge. They grovel on the ground, crawling and begging for the respect of the bourgeoisie."

	The article continues, "The proletarian dictatorship practiced by the Chinese people carries forward the tradition of the October Revolution. Chairman Mao has defended and truly creatively developed Lenin's thought."

	The article says: "Mao Zedong pointed out that in a socialist society, classes still exist, class struggle must be carried out, and the proletariat must continue to seize power from the remnants of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes and the emerging bourgeoisie."

	The article believes that the vicious attacks by the bourgeoisie on China and Chairman Mao prove the correctness of China and Chairman Mao, proving that China and Chairman Mao are upholding the October Revolution.

	The article says: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the true deepening of the October Revolution."

	The article points out that in contrast to the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, the Chinese people are continuing to struggle for socialism. "They have consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are engaged in fierce class struggle against China's Khrushchev and his followers. They have laid a solid foundation to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This is the greatest loyalty and contribution to the October Revolution."

	The article concludes, saying that all revolutionaries are celebrating the victory of the October Revolution with great joy, because although the Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the October Revolution, the spirit of the October Revolution still exists and continues to inspire people. China and Chairman Mao have provided a guarantee for the eternal existence and development of the spirit of the October Revolution. The peoples of all countries will take this as an example.

    澳共（马列）主席希尔谴责苏修背叛列宁的事业和思想
    毛主席真正继承和发展了马列主义
    中国无产阶级文化大革命是十月革命真正深入的发展
    新华社墨尔本四日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔，在一篇题为《中国继承了十月（革命）的传统》的文章中说，毛主席是“马克思列宁主义的真正继承者和发展者”，是“十月革命的维护者”。
    这篇刊登在二日的《先锋报》上的文章说：“今年，所有的革命者都将庆祝伟大的十月革命五十周年。五十年前，俄国的工农兵夺取了政权。十月革命的中心问题是工人阶级武装夺取政权，打碎资本主义的国家机器和建立无产阶级专政。”
    文章指出，十月革命证明，列宁的观点是绝对正确的。而苏联修正主义者背叛了列宁的事业和思想。
    文章在谈到苏修领导集团不久前就十月革命五十周年抛出的“提纲”时说：“只有彻头彻尾的叛徒才能提出这样一篇可悲的大杂烩。他们趴在地上，匍匐爬行，以博得资产阶级的尊敬。”
    文章接着说，中国人民实行的无产阶级专政发扬了十月革命的传统。毛主席维护并真正创造性地发展了列宁的思想。
    文章说：“毛泽东指出，在社会主义社会中仍然存在着阶级，必须进行阶级斗争，无产阶级必须继续向残余的资产阶级和封建阶级以及新兴的资产阶级夺权。”
    文章认为，资产阶级对中国和毛主席的恶毒攻击，恰好证明中国和毛主席的正确，证明中国和毛主席是维护十月革命的。
    文章说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是十月革命真正深入的发展。”
    文章指出，同苏联资本主义复辟成为对照的是：中国人民正在继续为社会主义而斗争。“他们巩固了无产阶级专政。他们正在同中国的赫鲁晓夫及其追随者进行激烈的阶级斗争。他们已经奠定了防止资本主义复辟的牢固基础。这是对十月革命的最大忠诚和最大贡献。”
    文章最后说，一切革命者正以无比高兴的心情庆祝十月革命的胜利，因为尽管苏修领导集团背叛了十月革命，十月革命的精神仍然存在，并且在鼓舞着人们。中国和毛主席为十月革命精神的永存和发扬光大提供了保证。世界各国人民将以此为榜样。
