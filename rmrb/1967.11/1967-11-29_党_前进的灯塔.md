    The Party—The Beacon of Progress
    The majestic mountains and rivers of Albania prepare a gift for you, you shine like a pearl. You make us proud, you are brighter than the stars. Every mine and factory we build illuminates the motherland like new stars. March forward, bravely march forward, towards the communist paradise. Party! The spring of the motherland, we feel boundless glory for you. Your words are the beacon of progress, the helmsman braves the raging waves and fierce winds. Party! The spring of the motherland, we feel boundless glory for you. Your words are the beacon of progress, the helmsman braves the raging waves and fierce winds.

    党——前进的灯塔
    阿尔巴尼亚　布拉哈壮丽的河山为你束装，你象珍珠一样辉煌。你使我们感到自豪，你比繁星更加明亮。我们建设的每座矿山工厂，都象新星把祖国照亮。向前进，奋勇向前进，奔向共产主义天堂。党啊！祖国的春天，我们为你感到无上荣光。你的话是前进的灯塔，舵手哪怕浪急风狂。党啊！祖国的春天，我们为你感到无上荣光。你的话是前进的灯塔，舵手哪怕浪急风狂。
