In the face of a new examination

— A Record of Beijing Post and Telecommunications University Graduates Filling Out the Allocation Preference Form with Public Spirit

"The words 'in the face of a new examination' were what we heard when we visited the graduates of Beijing Post and Telecommunications University. Some graduates, when introducing their situation of filling out the graduation allocation preference form, said: 'This is our final examination in university, and it is also our most recent examination in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!'"

A Unique Examination

The "examination paper" the graduates received was a simple form issued by the state to solicit the preferences of the graduates before allocation—a Graduation Allocation Self-Report Form. The form had five columns in the middle, allowing the filling of five units and regions, indicating each person's opinion on their work allocation after graduation. Filling out one form only required writing a few dozen words and took three to five minutes, so what was difficult about this examination?

In reality, this was not a new problem. Even before the Cultural Revolution, many graduates had considered what kind of work would best utilize their professional skills and which region would best suit their living habits. At the same time, some graduates, when accepting allocations, had the idea of "fighting for the three academies" (research institutes, colleges, and design institutes) and in regional choices, "fighting for Shanghai, striving for Beijing, and not too far, not too near, in Tianjin." These thoughts had some influence among them.

However, after more than a year of earth-shaking revolutionary mass movements, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved decisive victories. Currently, the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great battle call of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," driving our great motherland's revolution and construction towards new and greater victories. It is under such a situation that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao issued a mobilization order to the graduates: face the factories, face the countryside, face the grassroots, and go to where the socialist revolution and socialist construction are most needed!

To the Places Most Needed by the Revolution

The times are advancing, and history is leaping forward. Can we use the old answers from before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to participate in this new examination?

"No!" a female student answered firmly. This young person, born into a poor peasant family, had considered the issue of work allocation after graduation before the Cultural Revolution, with "selfishness" at the forefront. After thinking it over, it was nothing more than personal interests, hobbies, and future prospects. However, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution opened her eyes. The living facts of class struggle made her see that the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road had implemented a revisionist educational line in the school to serve the restoration of capitalism, and she herself was a victim of this revisionist educational line. Why did she not want to return to the countryside after leaving it for a few years? Why did she seek comfort and ease and not want to throw herself into the fiery struggle of the masses? After a fierce struggle in her thoughts, she determined that it was still Chairman Mao's teachings that were most intimate: "Communist Party members, regardless of the time and place, should not put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." Thus, she put "public spirit" at the forefront, resolutely abandoned the old answers to this examination, and this time wrote on the form with ten bold and powerful characters: "Go to where the revolution is most needed!"

A drop of water can reflect the sun. This female student's change in attitude towards graduation allocation in just over a year showed the tremendous changes in our era, showing the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. A large number of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, nurtured under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and baptized in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have undergone tremendous changes in their spiritual outlook. Resolutely fight against selfish thoughts

A young man who served as the leader of a revolutionary mass organization in his class had a segment of his thoughts during the graduation allocation that was another good example. In over a year of the Cultural Revolution, he, together with all the revolutionary youngsters in the school, closely followed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fiercely attacked the handful of power-holders within the Party who took the capitalist road. However, it was this daring and adventurous revolutionary youngster who, when it came to graduation allocation, had a thought in his mind: given his performance in the Cultural Revolution, the leadership would probably "consider" him and allocate him to Beijing! However, Chairman Mao's great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" quickly alerted him: why hope that the leadership would "consider" him? Wasn't participating in the Cultural Revolution to eradicate revisionism and prevent our country from restoring capitalism, rather than for personal gain? He was shocked by his fleeting thought, feeling ashamed of the Cultural Revolution he had fought for over a year, feeling guilty towards the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. He decided to, in this new examination, bring out the revolutionary rebellious spirit of charging forward in the Cultural Revolution and open fire on the "selfishness" in his mind! Thus, when filling out the graduation allocation preference, he did not write Beijing, which he had once considered the most ideal, but wrote the three most remote provinces and regions in this allocation plan—Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang.

Some classmates who had once been deceived and stood on the wrong side in the graduation allocation of this new examination showed particular excitement. They recalled the soul-stirring Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, recalling how the bourgeois reactionary line had poisoned them and how Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line had educated and liberated them, and their hearts resonated with the songs "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." A classmate firmly stated in this graduation allocation: "In the great examination hall of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, my test scores are not as good as many of my classmates. The reason is that I did not study Chairman Mao's works well and had selfish thoughts. With this lesson, I am determined to, in this new examination of graduation allocation, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, and achieve good results!"

The broad graduates deeply understood that they had grown up under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought and graduated in the unprecedented revolutionary storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The needs of the revolution were their aspirations. "Wherever Chairman Mao arranges us, we will firmly screw ourselves in place like a bolt." This was the graduates' oath. Opening the graduation allocation self-report form, one could see that phrases like "obey the country's allocation" or "firmly obey the needs of the revolution" almost became the common first choice of the more than 700 graduates in the entire school!

Offering Revolutionary Red Hearts to Chairman Mao

However, how could the simple words "obey the country's allocation" or "firmly obey the needs of the revolution" contain the boundless admiration of the revolutionary youngsters for Chairman Mao, how could they contain the revolutionary enthusiasm they had unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how could they contain their great aspirations to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over China and make it red all over the world?

Look at those graduation allocation self-report forms filled with strong revolutionary passion! Look at those graduates who are about to embark on their journey, see how they explained their aspirations to the country and the people in the "explanation" column!

One student wrote: "Without Chairman Mao's leadership and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no me today. I belong to the Party and the people. Therefore, although I wrote down my personal aspirations, I am completely obedient to the country's allocation."

Another student wrote: "Apart from the needs of the Party, the people, and the revolution, I have no other personal aspirations."

Some students copied Vice Chairman Lin Biao's precious instructions on the form to replace their explanations: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

Some students quoted Chairman Mao's great teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade."

Some students wrote down magnificent poems, offering their revolutionary red hearts to Chairman Mao. One poem reads:

"Pick up the heaviest burden on the shoulder,
Swear to protect the red mountains of the motherland.
With the determination of moving mountains like Yu Gong,
Break through countless difficulties.
A red heart like a flame,
Turn into a red flag and march forward forever!"

This is not just filling out a graduation allocation preference; this is a pledge! This is a pledge to the country, to the people, to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

Worthy of Our Great Era

Of course, in this new examination, not everyone passed with flying colors. The question is how to deal with the "selfishness" that has already been exposed. A graduate, when filling out the allocation preference, had emphasized his poor health and requested the leadership to "consider" him, allocating him to work in Guangdong, even expressing that he would "obey the correct allocation of the organization." This incident, if it had happened before the Cultural Revolution, might not have been a big deal, but in the Cultural Revolution, which has achieved decisive victories, and at the time when Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the situation was different. He felt that his thoughts were too out of sync with our great era, feeling that he was the kind of person Chairman Mao criticized: "When faced with a matter, first think of oneself, then think of others." What made him feel particularly ashamed was after studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" Comparing with Chairman Mao's instructions, he deeply realized that he had not passed this new examination, so the next day he resolutely took a "re-examination"—in a written statement, he solemnly declared: "My aspirations written yesterday are invalid; my greatest aspiration now is: firmly obey the allocation!"

Now, the graduation allocation self-report forms of Beijing Post and Telecommunications University graduates have been filled out, but the examination seems not to have ended. When we concluded our visit, some graduates said to us: "'Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism' is the great guideline that Chairman Mao has set for us, and it is also our lifelong honorable mission to strive for. Although this examination has ended, a new examination is waiting for us. We must, as Chairman Mao teaches, 'start anew from the beginning!'"

    在新的考试面前
    ——记北京邮电学院毕业生破私立公填写分配志愿表的故事
    “在新的考试面前”这几个字，是我们访问北京邮电学院毕业生时听到的。一些毕业生在介绍他们填写毕业分配志愿情况的时候说：“这是我们在大学里的最后一次考试，也是我们在无产阶级文化大革命中的最新的一次考试！”
                    一次不同寻常的考试
    毕业生们拿到的“试卷”，是国家在分配前征求毕业生本人志愿的一张很简单的表格——毕业生分配自报表。表格的中间有五个栏目，可以同时填写五个单位和地区，表示每个人在毕业后对于分配工作的意见。填一张表，只要写几十个字，花三五分钟就可以填完交卷，这样的考试有什么困难的呢？
    实际上，这也并不是什么新问题。早在文化大革命以前，对于做什么工作适宜于发挥自己的业务专长，到哪个地区去更合乎自己的生活习惯，他们中间的不少人已经考虑过，有了自己的小算盘。同时，过去一些毕业生接受分配时，在工作单位上“争三院”（研究院、学院、设计院）和在地区选择上“战上海，争北京，不远不近在天津”，这类思想在他们中间也发生过一定影响。
    但是，经过一年多震天动地的革命群众运动，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。当前，广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，热烈响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令，正在推动着我们伟大祖国的革命和建设走向新的更大的胜利。正是在这样的形势下，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部向毕业生们发出了动员令：面向工厂，面向农村，面向基层，到社会主义革命和社会主义建设最需要的地方去！
                   到革命最需要的地方去
    时代在前进，历史在飞跃。能够拿无产阶级文化大革命以前的老答案，来参加这次新的考试吗？
    “不能！”一个女同学斩钉截铁地回答。这个出生在贫农家庭的年轻人，在文化大革命前考虑毕业后分配工作的问题时，“私”字当头，考虑来考虑去，不外乎个人的兴趣、爱好和前途。但是，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命擦亮了她的眼睛。阶级斗争的活生生的事实使她看到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在学校推行了一条为复辟资本主义服务的修正主义教育路线，而自己正是这条修正主义教育路线的受害者。为什么自己离开农村几年就不愿再到农村去？为什么自己贪图舒适安逸而不愿投身到人民大众的火热的斗争中去？经过激烈的思想斗争，她认定还是毛主席的教导最亲切：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”于是，她“公”字当头，坚决摈弃了对这场考试的老答案，这次在表上毅然写下了十个刚劲有力的大字：“到革命最需要的地方去！”
    一滴水能够见太阳。这个女同学在仅仅一年多时间里对于毕业分配态度的改变，显示了我们时代天翻地覆的巨大变化，显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。一大批无产阶级革命事业接班人，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的洗礼下，精神面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。狠斗私心一闪念
    有个在班级里担任革命群众组织头头的小伙子，这次在毕业分配中的一段思想活动，是又一个很好的例证。在一年多的文化大革命中，他同全校的革命小将一道，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。可是，就是这个敢想敢闯的革命小将，在临到毕业分配的时候，脑子里却闪过这样一个念头：凭着自己在文化大革命中的表现，大概领导上会“照顾”一下，给分配在北京吧！然而，毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，使他很快警觉起来：为什么希望领导上“照顾”呢？难道自己参加文化大革命，不是为了根除修正主义、防止我们的国家复辟资本主义，反倒是为了个人的私利吗？他为自己一闪的念头吃惊，他感到有愧于为之奋斗了一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，他感到对不起最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。他决心在这次新的考试中，拿出在文化大革命中猛冲猛打的革命造反精神，向自己头脑里的“私”字开火！就这样，他在填写毕业分配志愿时，没有写他曾经认为最理想的北京，而是写上了这次分配方案中规定的三个最边远的省区——新疆，云南，黑龙江。
    一些曾经受过蒙蔽、一度站错了队的同学，在毕业分配的新考试中，显得特别激动。他们回想起一年多来触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命，回想起资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害而毛主席的无产阶级革命路线又是怎样教育和解放了自己，心头不禁回荡起《大海航行靠舵手》和《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》的颂歌声来。有个同学这次在毕业分配中，坚决表示要服从祖国分配。他严肃地说：“在无产阶级文化大革命这个大考场里，我跟许多同学比较起来，考试成绩差一些。原因是自己没有很好学习毛主席著作，有私心杂念。有了这个教训，我决心在毕业分配这次新的考试中活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，破私立公，考出好成绩来！”
    广大毕业生深深懂得，自己是靠着毛泽东思想的阳光雨露成长起来的，是在无产阶级文化大革命这个史无前例的革命大风暴中毕业的，革命的需要就是自己的志愿。“毛主席把我们安排在哪里，我们就要象螺丝钉一样牢牢地拧在哪里。”这就是毕业生们的誓言。翻开毕业生分配自报表就可以看到，类似“服从祖国分配”或者“坚决服从革命需要”这样的字眼，几乎成了全院七百多名毕业生共同的第一志愿！
                   向毛主席献出革命红心
    但是，“服从祖国分配”或者“坚决服从革命需要”这样简短的几个字，又怎么能容得下革命小将们无限敬仰毛主席的赤胆忠心，怎么能容得下他们在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命豪情，怎么能容得下他们要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国、红遍全世界的远大抱负？
    请看看那一张张洋溢着强烈革命激情的毕业生分配自报表吧！看看那些即将踏上征途的毕业生们，是怎样在“说明”一栏里向祖国和人民解释自己的志愿的吧！
    一个同学写道：“没有毛主席的领导，没有毛泽东思想的哺育，就没有我的今天。我是属于党和人民的。因此，我虽然写上了个人的志愿，但我是完全服从祖国分配的。”
    一个同学写道：“除了党的、人民的、革命的需要以外，我没有自己任何别的个人志愿。”
    有的同学在表上抄录了林彪副主席的宝贵指示来代替自己的解释：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    有的同学摘引了毛主席的伟大教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”
    还有些同学写下了豪迈的诗篇，向毛主席献出自己的革命红心。有一首诗写道：
   “专拣重担挑在肩，
    誓保祖国红江山。
    立下愚公移山志，
    力破万重困难关。
    一颗红心似火焰，
    化作红旗永向前！”
    这哪里是在填写毕业分配志愿呢？这是在宣誓！这是在向祖国宣誓，向人民宣誓，向我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席宣誓！
                   不愧于我们伟大的时代
    当然，在这次新的考试中，并不是所有的人都一下子考得好的。问题是对自己已经暴露出来的“私”字采取什么态度。有个毕业生在填写分配志愿时，曾经过分强调自己身体不好而要求领导上“照顾”，分配他到广东工作，甚至表示只“服从组织正确的分配”。这件事情要是发生在文化大革命以前，也许算不得什么，但是在文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的今天，在毛主席发出“斗私，批修”伟大号召的时候，情形就不同了。他感到自己的思想和我们伟大的时代太不合辙了，他感到自己就是毛主席批评的那种人：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”他感到特别惭愧的，是在学习了毛主席的这个教导以后：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”对照毛主席的指示，他深深意识到自己在这次新的考试中没有及格，因此在第二天毅然决然地来了一次“补考”——在一份书面声明中郑重表示：“我昨天写的志愿作废；我现在的最大志愿是：坚决服从分配！”
    现在，北京邮电学院毕业生的毕业分配自报表已经填完了，但考试看来并没有结束。在我们结束访问的时候，有的毕业生对我们这样说：“‘斗私，批修’是毛主席给我们规定的伟大纲领，也是我们要终生奋斗的光荣任务。这次考试虽然已经结束了，新的考试又在等待着我们。我们一定要象毛主席教导的那样：‘而今迈步从头越！’”
