According to Xinhua News Agency from Tirana on the 4th, the editorial of the Albanian Trade Union Central Council's organ, the "Labor Newspaper," recently published an article commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The article exposes and severely condemns the crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership in domestic capitalist restoration and strengthening the oppression and exploitation of the working class. The article points out that the Soviet people will surely rise up to defend the fruits of the October Socialist Revolution, smash the traitorous group of Khrushchev revisionists, and bring the Soviet Union back to the path of Marxism-Leninism.

The article states that the traitorous group of Khrushchev revisionists seized power and fundamentally undermined the historically significant cause of the October Revolution—the cause of Lenin, Stalin, and millions of Soviet people. Today, a new type of bourgeoisie has formed in the Soviet Union, which has usurped the power of the working class and ruthlessly oppresses and exploits the working class. The social foundation of the capitalist and revisionist system, due to the establishment of the economic foundation of the capitalist and revisionist system and the implementation of the capitalist production law, is gradually being strengthened.

The article states that the deceptive nature is a characteristic of the economic policies of the revisionist leadership. The so-called "new economic reforms" advocated by the Khrushchev revisionists are merely a bridge to capitalism. The "new economic reforms" use "material incentives," "material interests," "enterprise profits," and other pretexts to suppress the resistance of the working class, undermine the great principles of socialist concentration and planned economy, and introduce anarchism into production, thus establishing a blind economy. The article states that Soviet workers are angry about these actions and are rising up in rebellion.

The article points out that the "new economic reforms" leading to decentralized management have opened the way for anarchic production and the maximum extraction of profits from the laboring masses. Phenomena such as the pursuit of profit, placing narrow personal interests above collective and long-term interests, and other phenomena of capitalist society are rampant in the Soviet Union. Phenomena such as the strong preying on the weak and layer-by-layer exploitation are increasing. Due to the promotion of capitalist labor competition, the result is that workers are being laid off and unemployment is increasing. In some regions, many dismissals have sparked workers' protests and strikes, and the revisionists use the same methods and means as capitalists to deal with them, first and foremost using sticks, threats, coercion, and high-pressure tactics.

The article states that the Soviet economy's subjugation to foreign capital is one of the main paths to degeneration into capitalism. The great October Revolution drove out and eliminated the capitalist society that sucked the blood and sweat of the Russian proletariat under the tsarist regime. On the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet revisionist group is concluding and continuing to conclude contracts with capitalist countries, allowing monopolistic capitalists from Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and other countries to invest in the Soviet Union. Brezhnev and Kosygin await the arrival of the blood-sucking vampires of capitalist trusts and companies in the Kremlin with religious devotion.

The article concludes by stating that the Soviet working class is increasingly recognizing the treacherous actions of the Khrushchev revisionist leadership and is dispelling the fog of revisionist propaganda. Communists and the working class have strengthened their resistance to the rule of Khrushchev revisionism. The faithful successors of Lenin, Stalin, and the glorious Bolsheviks will not long tolerate this unprecedented betrayal in the history of the people. The great Soviet people will rise up in revolution, defend the great October Revolution, overthrow and thoroughly smash the traitorous group of Khrushchev, and bring the Soviet Union back to the path of Marxism-Leninism.

    阿《劳动报》揭露和谴责苏修集团在国内复辟资本主义
    苏联人民必将起来保卫十月革命的胜利果实
    推翻苏修叛徒集团，使苏联重新回到马列主义的道路上来
    据新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会机关报《劳动报》最近就十月社会主义革命五十周年发表编辑部文章，揭露和严厉谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在国内大搞资本主义复辟，加强压迫和剥削工人阶级的可耻罪行。文章指出，苏联人民必将起来保卫十月社会主义革命的胜利果实，砸烂赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团，使苏联重新回到马克思列宁主义的道路上来。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团窃取了政权，从根本上破坏了十月革命具有历史意义的事业——列宁、斯大林和千百万苏联人民的事业。今天，在苏联已经形成了一个新型的资产阶级，它篡夺了工人阶级的政权，无情地压迫和剥削工人阶级。资本主义、修正主义制度的社会基础，由于资本主义、修正主义制度经济基础的建立和资本主义生产规律的实施，正在逐步地得到加强。
    文章说，欺骗性是修正主义领导的经济政策的特征。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早就鼓吹的所谓“新经济改革”，只不过是通向资本主义的桥梁。“新经济改革”以“物质刺激”、“物质利益”、“企业利润”等等为借口，竭力压制工人阶级的反抗，破坏社会主义集中和计划经济的伟大原则，把无政府主义推行到生产中去，从而建立盲目的经济。文章说，苏联工人对这些行径感到愤怒，正在起来造反。
    文章指出，导致经济分散经营的“新经济改革”，为生产的无政府主义、最大限度地从劳动群众身上谋取利润开辟了道路。唯利是图，把个人的狭隘利益置于整体利益和长远利益之上等等资本主义社会的一切现象，正在苏联泛滥。弱肉强食和层层压榨等现象越来越多。由于推行资本主义的劳动竞争，结果工人被逐，失业增加。在一些地区，许多解职事件引起了工人的抗议和罢工，而修正主义者采取资本家一样的手段和方法来加以对付，首先就是使用棍棒、恐吓、强制和高压手段。
    文章说，苏联经济屈从于外国资本，是堕落为资本主义的主要途径之一。伟大的十月革命，赶走和消灭了在沙皇恩赐下吸吮俄国无产阶级血汗的资本主义社会。在纪念十月革命五十周年的今天，苏联修正主义集团却同资本主义国家缔结了并正在继续缔结契约，让英、法、日、意等垄断资本家在苏联投资。勃列日涅夫和柯西金以敬神般的虔诚，在克里姆林宫等候资本主义托辣斯和公司的吸血鬼的到来。
    文章最后说，苏联工人阶级正在日益认清赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导的背叛行径，正在驱散修正主义蛊惑宣传的迷雾。共产党人和工人阶级已经加强了他们对赫鲁晓夫修正主义统治的反抗活动。列宁、斯大林和光荣的布尔什维克忠实的继承者，决不会长久地容忍这一人民历史上空前的叛卖。伟大的苏联人民必将起来革命，捍卫伟大的十月革命，推翻和彻底砸烂赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团，使苏联重新回到马克思列宁主义的道路上来。
