Editor's Note: The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary workers on the coal industry front have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have achieved remarkable results by "going to the pits to carry out the revolution and going underground to promote production."

Coal is the lifeblood of industry. Coal production is related to the socialist construction of our country, to industrial and agricultural production, to the lives of urban and rural people, to the successful conduct of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great strategic decision to prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people. Therefore, we hope that the proletarian revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front will, with a strong sense of responsibility as masters of the state, direct the boundless enthusiasm released by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. We hope that the revolutionary cadres at all levels on the coal industry front and related departments will quickly go to the production front line and work together with revolutionary workers to promote coal production further. We hope that the PLA soldiers who are supporting the left and supporting work on the coal front will make new contributions to promoting coal production.

Currently, it is also a very important task to vigorously promote coal conservation. We must carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," widely publicize the great economic and political significance of coal conservation to industrial users, urban and rural residents, and mine workers, and definitely do a good job in coal conservation.

Revolutionary Workers Strive to Produce More and Better Coal

Coal Production in Henan and Inner Mongolia Thrives

Henan Holds Provincial Coal Industry Telephone Conference to Deploy Current Coal Production Tasks

Thirty-six Mines in Inner Mongolia See Significant Increase in Production Compared to the Same Period Last Year

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 20 — Coal production in Henan Province is thriving. The province's raw coal production has significantly increased since September.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers on Henan's coal industry front, inspired by the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the workers on the coal industry front, are full of fighting spirit and enthusiasm. After Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," every coal mine in the province set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to break down "selfishness" and criticize revisionism, thereby promoting the progress of various tasks. Revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones are increasingly consolidated and developed, and the production leadership teams are continuously strengthened and improved.

The frontline command department for "grasp revolution and promote production" in Henan Province recently held a provincial coal industry telephone conference to further implement the policy of "grasp revolution and promote production" and deploy the current coal production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot — The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the strong support of the PLA's left-supporting troops, are vigorously promoting revolution and production. Raw coal production is steadily increasing, and the entire coal industry front is in a very good situation.

The raw coal production of thirty-six large, medium, and small coal mines in the region has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. By the end of the third quarter, the raw coal production of medium and small coal mines in the entire region had completed more than 80% of the annual plan, with six mines completing the annual national production plan one quarter ahead of schedule. In October, the region's raw coal production increased by more than 10% compared to September.

The excellent situation on the coal industry front in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the result of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao. Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front in the region have, in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and insisted on promoting revolution above ground and production below ground, achieving a double harvest of revolution and production. They concentrated their firepower and targets, exposing and criticizing Khrushchev's Chinese lackey and his agents in Inner Mongolia, thoroughly eliminating the poison spread by revisionism in coal enterprises. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad masses of revolutionary workers have greatly increased their proletarian consciousness and their enthusiasm for socialist labor has reached an unprecedented height. They regard every shovel of coal as a contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, producing more coal for the revolution and better coal for the revolution, and the attendance rate is continuously improving.

Recently, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers in various mines have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, actively carried out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, and further established and improved the system of studying Chairman Mao's works. Before and after work, the broad masses of workers study the "Old Five Articles," break down "selfishness," establish "public spirit," and firmly uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers in coal mines have achieved revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, effectively promoting coal production.

    煤炭是工业的粮食。煤炭生产，关系到我国社会主义建设，关系到工农业生产，关系到城乡人民生活，关系到无产阶级文化大革命的胜利进行，关系到实现毛主席的备战、备荒、为人民的伟大战略决策。因此，希望煤炭工业战线上的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，以国家主人翁的高度责任感，把无产阶级文化大革命焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产上去。希望煤炭工业战线和有关部门的各级革命干部迅速走上生产第一线，和革命工人一起，同心协力，再接再厉，把煤炭生产进一步促上去。希望在煤炭战线上支左支工的解放军指战员，为促进煤炭生产作出新的贡献。
    当前，狠抓节约用煤，也是一项十分重要的工作。我们要贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，向工业用户、城乡居民和矿区职工，广泛宣传节约煤炭的重大经济意义和政治意义，一定把节约煤炭工作做好。
