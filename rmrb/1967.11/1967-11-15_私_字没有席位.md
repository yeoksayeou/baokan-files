Now, some revolutionary mass organizations are engaged in endless debates over the so-called "seat" issue, which hinders the consolidation and development of the great alliance of revolutionaries.

How should this problem be correctly solved? The experience of Qingdao City's Paohua Alkali Factory is: guided by Mao Zedong Thought, to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to make more self-criticisms, and to promote the genuine unity of revolutionaries on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, everyone becomes one faction, becomes the faction of Mao Zedong Thought, and all problems are easily resolved.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members should not vie for personal military command (they absolutely must not vie, and must never learn from Zhang Guotao again), but should vie for the military command of the Party, should vie for the military command of the people."

The comrades of Qingdao City's Paohua Alkali Factory are doing exactly this according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are doing the right thing. They understand: the proletariat only has the issue of contending for and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Within the proletariat, there is no fundamental conflict of interests, and therefore, there should be no contention for power among them; instead, they should unite as one on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and jointly exercise power well.

All proletarian revolutionaries must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, and wage a resolute struggle against the "self" in their own minds, striving to consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolutionaries.

### “私”字没有席位

    “私”字没有席位
    现在，有一些革命群众组织，为所谓“席位”问题争论不休，妨碍了革命大联合的巩固和发展。
    怎样正确解决这个问题呢？青岛市泡花碱厂的经验是：以毛泽东思想为指导，破私立公，多作自我批评，促使革命派真正在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来。这样，大家都成了一派，成了毛泽东思想派，一切问题就迎刃而解了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“共产党员不争个人的兵权（决不能争，再也不要学张国焘），但要争党的兵权，要争人民的兵权。”
    青岛市泡花碱厂的同志们就是遵照毛主席的教导去做的。他们做得很对。他们懂得：工人阶级只有对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，才有争权、夺权的问题。在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突，因此，彼此之间也就不应该争权；而应该在毛泽东思想的基础上团结一致，共同掌好权用好权。
    一切无产阶级革命派，都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，为巩固和发展革命的大联合而努力。
