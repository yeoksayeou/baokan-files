The "Iron and Steel Platoon" is a unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Western Region of South Vietnam that has achieved outstanding military feats.

When talking about the "Iron and Steel Platoon," it is truly as strong as steel. Over four years, this unit has fought bravely and tenaciously, achieving brilliant victories despite being outnumbered and outmatched.

In the Battle of Kinh Thoai, the "Iron and Steel Platoon" faced an enemy force of six battalions, supported by two armored car companies and hundreds of aircraft. However, the heroes of the "Iron and Steel Platoon" repulsed the enemy's twenty assaults, routing them completely.

Not long ago, in the Vinh Long region, the "Iron and Steel Platoon" encountered an enemy force forty-eight times larger than their own, and the terrain was unfavorable. However, none of this could shake the soldiers' iron will to destroy the enemy. They utilized the power of close combat, closing in on the enemy and bravely and cleverly dividing and annihilating them in small groups. As a result, the "Iron and Steel Platoon" decimated the enemy forces.

The "Iron and Steel Platoon" has been able to achieve continuous victories not only because of the soldiers' bravery but also because they have the support of the people and have forged deep bonds with them. Everywhere they go, they focus on propaganda work and organizing the masses, helping the people build air-raid shelters, assisting with production, and fortifying combat villages. Even during intense battles, they rush to save homes and rice from fires, and rescue people from collapsed air-raid shelters. The people regard the soldiers of the "Iron and Steel Platoon" as their own family.

    杀敌如猛虎　爱民如亲人
    “钢铁连队”坚如钢
    “钢铁连队”是越南南方西区立过出色战功的一支解放军部队。
    说起“钢铁连队”，真是象钢铁一样。在四年时间里，这支部队英勇顽强，以弱胜强，以少胜多，建立了光辉的战绩。
    京帅一战，在“钢铁连队”面前的是拥有六个营兵力，以及两个装甲车支团、成百架飞机的强敌，但是“钢铁连队”的英雄却击退了敌军发动的二十次冲锋，把敌人打得落花流水，一败涂地。
    不久前在永远地区，“钢铁连队”碰上了比自己多四十八倍的敌军，而且当时地形对“钢铁连队”很不利。但是，这一切压不倒战士歼敌的钢铁意志，他们发挥了近战的威力，逼近敌人，勇敢、机智地把敌人分成小块加以消灭。结果，“钢铁连队”把敌人打得土崩瓦解。
      “钢铁连队”所以能这样不断取胜，除了战士们的英勇之外，还因为他们有人民的支持，同人民结下了深厚的感情。他们每到一个地方都注意搞宣传工作、群众工作，替人民修建防空洞，帮助人民搞生产、巩固战斗乡。甚至在进行激烈战斗的时候，他们还抢救失火的民房、稻谷，抢救被炸塌的防空洞里的人民。人民把“钢铁连队”的战士看成是自己的亲人。
