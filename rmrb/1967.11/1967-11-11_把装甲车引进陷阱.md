One day, just as dawn was breaking, a large enemy force invaded a certain village, with a squad of armored vehicles following behind, attempting to surround and capture the guerrillas.

When C saw this squad of armored vehicles, he muttered to himself, "Just wait, I'll lead you into the pigsty!"

He then circled around to the enemy's rear and launched an attack, killing two enemy soldiers.

The enemy turned around and fired in C's direction. C then ran towards a bare hill, deliberately allowing the enemy to spot him.

The enemy commander ordered the soldiers and armored vehicles to pursue C. The armored vehicles led the way, rumbling up the hill. Suddenly, with a loud boom, the leading armored vehicle fell into a trap set by the guerrillas, and the four enemy soldiers inside were crushed to death. The following armored vehicles and enemy soldiers, frightened out of their wits, hastily retreated.

    把装甲车引进陷阱
    一天，天刚发亮，大批敌人闯进了某乡，还有一队装甲车跟在后面，企图包围活捉游击队员。
    C同志看见这队装甲车时，便自言自语地说：“等着吧，我要把你们带进猪圈里去！”
    于是他就绕到敌人背后进行袭击，打死两名敌人。
    敌人掉过头来向C的方向扫射。C便向一个光秃的山岗跑去，有意让敌人发现。
    敌军指挥官下令士兵和装甲车追赶C。装甲车走在前面，??地爬上山坡。突然轰?一声，走在前头的一辆装甲车掉进了游击队的陷阱，车上的四名敌人被撞死在车里。后面的装甲车和敌人吓破了胆，慌忙掉头逃回去了。　（据新华社讯）
