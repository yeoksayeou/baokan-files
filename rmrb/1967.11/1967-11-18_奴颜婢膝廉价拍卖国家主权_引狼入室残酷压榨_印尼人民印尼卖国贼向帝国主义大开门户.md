The fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia recently held an "Indonesia Investment Conference" in Geneva, attended by monopolistic capitalists from imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain. At this conference, they conducted a large-scale auction of Indonesia's natural resources and national sovereignty.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the conference, which ran from the 2nd to the 4th of this month, was attended by nearly seventy monopolistic capitalists from the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland, and Australia, as well as representatives from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, all of which are controlled by the United States.

The Indonesian fascist military regime sent an official delegation, consisting of Foreign Minister Malik, Minister of Economics and Finance Bawono, and fourteen high-ranking officials, to participate in the conference.

The representatives of the Indonesian fascist military regime performed shamelessly at the conference, fully exposing their traitorous and ugly faces. The head of this regime, Suharto, sent a congratulatory message to the conference, stating that his regime is striving to create a "politically and economically stable atmosphere" to attract more foreign capital. Malik shamelessly proclaimed at the conference that the Indonesian fascist military regime offers "interesting and promising prospects" for foreign monopolistic capital to invest in Indonesia. Bawono gave a lengthy speech, opening the door to thieves and inviting imperialist monopolistic capital to invade Indonesia. He shamelessly told the monopolistic capitalists attending the conference, "Indonesia has a population of 110 million, of which 72 percent live in agricultural areas, which is a vast and potential market for your industries." He also mentioned that Indonesia has undeveloped mineral resources and abundant cheap labor. He urged imperialist monopolistic capital to invest in the mining of nickel, tin, and other minerals, as well as in forestry and fisheries in Indonesia.

Suharto's senior advisor, Salim, revealed at the conference that there are more than fifty investment projects under negotiation between imperialist monopolistic capital and the Indonesian fascist military regime. He said that monopolistic capitalists from the United States and Canada are "very interested" in mining tin, bauxite, gold, silver, and nickel in Indonesia, while those from France, Japan, and Australia are interested in developing Indonesia's forests.

Malik, Bawono, and Salim were all eager to sell out their country, urgently requesting monopolistic capitalists from the United States, Britain, and other countries to conduct on-site investigations in Indonesia.

    奴颜婢膝廉价拍卖国家主权　引狼入室残酷压榨
    印尼人民印尼卖国贼向帝国主义大开门户
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，最近在日内瓦举行的由美、英等帝国主义国家的垄断资本家出席的“印尼投资会议”上，对印尼自然资源和国家主权进行了一次大拍卖。
    据西方通讯社报道，出席这次从二日开到四日的会议的，有来自美国、英国、日本、西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、加拿大、瑞士和澳大利亚的近七十个垄断资本家以及由美国控制的世界银行、国际货币基金组织和经济合作与发展组织的代表。
    印尼法西斯军人政权派遣由外交部长马利克、经济和财政部长布沃诺和十四名高级官员组成的官方代表团参加了会议。
    印尼法西斯军人政权的代表在这个会议上竞相表演，赤裸裸地暴露了他们的卖国贼的丑恶面目。这个政权的头目苏哈托在打给会议的“贺电”中表示，他的政权正努力为吸引更多的外国资本而“创造政治经济稳定的气氛”。马利克在会上恬不知耻地宣扬说，印尼法西斯军人政权向外国垄断资本在印尼进行投资“提供了有兴趣的和有希望的前景”。布沃诺在会上做了长篇发言，开门揖盗，要求帝国主义垄断资本侵入印尼。他无耻地向出席会议的垄断资本家说：“印尼有一亿一千万人口，其中百分之七十二居住在农业地区，这是你们的工业的广阔的、潜在的市场”，印尼还有“没有开发的矿产资源和丰富的廉价劳动力”。他要求帝国主义垄断资本向印尼的镍、锡等矿藏开采、森林开伐和渔业等方面进行投资。
    苏哈托的高级顾问萨利姆在会上透露，帝国主义垄断资本同印尼法西斯军人政权正在商谈的投资项目，已达五十多个。他说，美国、加拿大等国的垄断资本家对开采印尼的锡、铁矾土、金、银、镍等“很感兴趣”，而法国，日本和澳大利亚等国的垄断资本家则对开发印尼的森林“感兴趣”。
    马利克、布沃诺和萨利姆都卖国心切，竭力要求美、英等国垄断资本家到印尼去进行现场调查。
