On November 14, the red diplomats who had just returned from Jakarta to the capital, back to Chairman Mao's side, saw the great leader they had longed for day and night.

Facing Chairman Mao, these iron warriors who had once stood tall and defiantly faced the muzzles of Indonesian fascist thugs could no longer hold back their emotions, and each one shed tears of joy.

Facing Chairman Mao, these heroes who had maintained national dignity with their blood during the anti-fascist struggle shouted over and over, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Facing Chairman Mao, these red diplomats nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought were stirred and deeply moved, whispering in their hearts:

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts. During the days and nights of the anti-fascist struggle, we thought of you every moment. It is you who gave us courage and wisdom, and it is your brilliant thoughts that guided us to victory in the struggle!"

The dignity of the motherland is inviolable! The Five-Star Red Flag is inviolable!

It was the early hours of October 1. In Jakarta, the Chinese Embassy, this piece of red soil, was festive. In the center of the embassy hall, a giant statue of Chairman Mao shone brightly, and the bright lights illuminated the red characters "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China" in front of the hall. Twenty Chinese red diplomats who had been fighting against the Indonesian reactionaries for a long time wore shining Mao badges on their chests, cherished thoughts of Chairman Mao, and were ready to celebrate the holiday with the people of the motherland in the hall in front of Chairman Mao's statue, sharing in the glorious victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland.

At this very moment, a horrifying and unprecedented fascist atrocity in the history of international relations occurred. The right-wing military regime led by Suharto-Nasution, in order to beg for more dollars and rubles, and to completely destroy the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people established in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism, drove fully armed police and a large number of thugs, screaming, into the inviolable Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. They brandished knives and guns, rampaged, and committed all manner of evil.

A severe struggle was placed before our red diplomats.

The dignity of the motherland is inviolable! The twenty heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately mobilized. They said: "The Suharto-Nasution reactionary government deliberately chose the great national holiday of the Chinese people, the National Day, to create new fascist atrocities. This is an extremely serious provocation to our great motherland. We are diplomats sent by Chairman Mao, and we must use our lives to defend the dignity of the motherland."

The red diplomats each stood firm at their posts, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," fearless of violence, unafraid of sacrifice, and angrily shouting, "Fascist thugs, get out!" "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" In the anti-fascist struggle, many comrades were injured, their bodies covered in blood, but they still recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They looked at the Five-Star Red Flag flying over the embassy and touched the Mao badges on their chests, determined to fight to the end with the enemy.

On one side of the embassy, Acting Charge d'Affaires Huang Wenxing and Comrade Yang Zhengguo were engaged in a fierce struggle with the thugs. Suddenly, a bullet flew in and hit Huang Wenxing in the chest. Huang Wenxing fell in a pool of blood. After a while, he regained consciousness and said to Yang Zhengguo beside him, "Little Yang, don't worry about me, go tell the comrades to fight to the end!" He then repeatedly recited the quotations from Chairman Mao: "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

The thugs rushed to Yang Zhengguo's side and knocked him unconscious with a bottle. At this moment, Yang Zhengguo suddenly remembered that there was a small Five-Star Red Flag on the table. The Five-Star Red Flag is a symbol of our great motherland and must not fall into the hands of the enemy. He struggled free from the thugs and lunged forward, clutching the Five-Star Red Flag in his hand. The thugs beat him and threatened him with guns, demanding that he hand over the flag. Yang, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, was fearless and unyielding, and finally protected the red Five-Star Red Flag with his blood.

On the other side of the embassy, Chen Jinpei and Zhou Qinglong and others, despite the fierce shooting by the thugs, tenaciously defended their positions. At the most brutal moment of the enemy's attack, both Chen Jinpei and Zhou Qinglong were injured, but they remained spirited and read Chairman Mao's quotations, standing firm. Chen Jinpei loved Chairman Mao dearly, studied "Old Three Articles" and other works of Chairman Mao seriously, and put into practice what he learned. After the Indonesian reactionaries launched an anti-China wave, he had made three flagpoles for the embassy. If the Indonesian thugs attacked, one flagpole was destroyed, the Five-Star Red Flag of the great motherland would quickly rise on another flagpole. He said: "We may be beaten, our property may be smashed, but our Five-Star Red Flag, no matter what, must always fly high." This time, in the struggle with the thugs, his head was smashed, blood flowing, but he still encouraged the injured Zhou Qinglong, despised the thugs, and continued the struggle.

Twenty warriors, each making a steel oath: "Head can be cut off, blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be lost!" Twenty warriors, each determined: "The dignity of the motherland is inviolable! The Five-Star Red Flag is inviolable!"

The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, each stood tall and fearless. They looked down on the enemy as dirt, fought bravely against the invading thugs, showing the great fearlessness of the Chinese people and the invincible heroism of the great Chinese people.

The despicable thugs grew more numerous, driven by Indonesian reactionary officers like a pack of mad dogs, closing in on our red diplomats. The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland glared at the thugs with hatred, arm in arm, standing tall. They shouted in unison over and over, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" They recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison over and over, "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." And they repeatedly shouted loudly, "Fascist thugs, get out of the Chinese Embassy!" In front of our unyielding red diplomats, the thugs were cowardly and despicable.

After several hours of anti-fascist struggle, our twenty red diplomats had all been shot or beaten. The Indonesian reactionaries, in order to achieve their shameful goal of looting and illegally searching our embassy, disregarding the strong protests of our red diplomats, forcibly abducted all personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta and took them to the Central Army Hospital in Jakarta. Our red diplomats clearly knew: the struggle was not over. But no matter what despicable means the Indonesian reactionaries used, what tricks they played, they were determined to practice Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of death, it will trample all enemies, and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight."

Just as the comrades were preparing for the new battle, the clock in Jakarta struck nine. It was exactly 10:00 AM Beijing time. The great moment that the world was watching had arrived. Twenty warriors, forgetting the pain of their wounds, twenty warriors, twenty red hearts, beating with the hearts of 700 million people of the motherland. At this moment, their hearts flew to the capital of the great motherland, and they seemed to hear the melody of "The East Is Red," and seemed to see our great leader, the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, stepping onto Tiananmen Gate in the cheers. How moved the twenty sons and daughters of the motherland were! They could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

The red diplomats thought of Chairman Mao, thought of the great motherland, and suddenly felt an endless source of strength. They wished they could immediately sprout wings and fly back to the embassy to tell the Indonesian revolutionary people, to tell the patriotic Chinese in Indonesia, to announce: All anti-China clowns will ultimately be hoisted by their own petard. Warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. Although the reactionaries look terrifying, they have no real power." Just as our great leader Chairman Mao made the wise judgment, the Indonesian reactionaries are paper tigers. Under the resolute struggle of our twenty red diplomats backed by 700 million Chinese people, the plots of the Indonesian reactionaries were completely foiled. The Suharto-Nasution reactionary government was forced to agree to all the serious demands of our red diplomats: immediately remove the red and white flag hung inside the Chinese Embassy, immediately withdraw the thugs occupying our embassy, take responsibility for treating our injured personnel, and immediately send our personnel back to the embassy.

Victory! The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland won!

On the same night, at the moment when the great people of the motherland were celebrating the National Day, our red diplomats, except for a few comrades with serious injuries who remained in the hospital, all returned to the embassy in triumph.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland are the red diplomats nurtured by your thoughts, and the victory of the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland is the great victory of your brilliant thoughts. Returning to the door of the embassy, the red diplomats lined up and recited Chairman Mao's teachings on cultivating revolutionary heroism in unison, solemnly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The slogans pierced the night sky of Jakarta, stirring the heart.

The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, reciting the highest directives, entered the embassy, returned to the sacred territory of our great motherland, and returned to their battlefield. Before their eyes was a scene of looting, all the buildings and furnishings of the embassy had been ravaged by the thugs. The comrades were filled with anger, but at the same time, they were more alert, ready to repel any thugs who dared to attack, striving for greater victory.

The diplomats with hearts turned to the great leader Chairman Mao found a picture of Chairman Mao, then found a few wooden sticks to make a frame, and then hung it high in the center of the hall. The quotation board of Chairman Mao in the hall was destroyed by the thugs, and the comrades found two small blackboards and wrote Chairman Mao's teachings on them with chalk: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, unafraid of fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland looked up at Chairman Mao's picture with deep emotion, and each made a solemn vow from the heart, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts! Seeing you, our eyes are bright and our direction is clear; seeing you, our hearts are red and our bones are hard. Dear Chairman Mao, rest assured! In the stormy international class struggle, we must read your books better, listen to your words, act according to your instructions, and be your loyal and devoted good warriors.

The words of Chairman Mao are our struggle program.

The next day, at dawn, the red sun rose. Our red diplomats came to the embassy lawn and raised a national flag protected with blood. The Five-Star Red Flag flew high in the sky over Jakarta again, looking more solemn and beautiful, announcing to the people of the world: The great China of the Mao Zedong era is inviolable!

As expected, the Indonesian fascist military regime sent armed police with machine guns and rocket launchers to surround our embassy. From then on, our red diplomats launched a long-term struggle against the blockade by the Indonesian reactionaries.

Our embassy's external communications were cut off, and the diplomats' freedom to go out was severely curtailed. They lost contact with the motherland. What should they do? Everyone said: "No matter how difficult it is, it cannot stop the warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's works are the highest directives for us! The words of Chairman Mao are our struggle program!" From then on, our red diplomats studied Chairman Mao's works more diligently, drawing endless strength from them. As soon as the sky brightened, the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland began to read Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures, some reciting the "Old Three Articles," and others reading Chairman Mao's quotations about serving the people wholeheartedly. A few comrades in the hospital, without Chairman Mao's works or the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," relied on memory, reciting to each other, arming their minds, encouraging themselves, and urging themselves to fight against the enemy. Nine days later, due to the struggle of the embassy comrades, the Indonesian reactionary government was forced to allow the embassy comrades to visit them. On the day the comrades met, the embassy comrades brought Chairman Mao's picture, the beloved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges to the few seriously injured comrades. The comrades were so happy, they hung Chairman Mao's picture by their beds and wore Mao badges on their chests. Everyone had tears in their eyes, gazing at Chairman Mao's picture for a long time, vowing in their hearts: "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Truly the heroic sons and daughters of the great motherland.

"You have greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and greatly dampened the arrogance of the American imperialist running dog, the Indonesian reactionaries."

"You are truly the heroic sons and daughters of the great motherland, truly the red diplomats of Chairman Mao. Your heroic deeds have set a brilliant example for all foreign affairs personnel in our country." ...

On October 9, the embassy comrades turned on the radio to listen to the broadcast from the motherland and suddenly heard a familiar voice broadcasting Premier Zhou Enlai's telegram on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, sent on October 7, to all red diplomats.

"This is the voice of the motherland, this is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for us!"

In an instant, the embassy was in an uproar, the red diplomats had tears streaming down their faces, gathered around the radio, listening carefully word by word, and then carefully recording the telegram.

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The comrades held the telegram for a long time, excitedly shouting slogans of infinite love and gratitude for the great leader Chairman Mao. When they saw in the telegram "We hope you continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be ready at any time to face more acute struggles, and strive for greater victories" in the telegram, they said: "This is the requirement of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the people of the motherland for us, and we will resolutely carry it out." That night, the red diplomats of the motherland wrote a pledge to the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. The pledge read:

"We have heard the voice of the reddest sun in our hearts, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! We have heard the voice of 700 million people of the motherland! This is the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us! We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times, 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!' All our comrades resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and no matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, we are determined to defend the dignity of the motherland with our blood and lives, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely fight to the end with the Indonesian reactionaries!"

Victory! The red diplomats' struggle won!

The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland returned to the great capital of the motherland on November 3, bringing with them the fighting friendship of the Indonesian people for the Chinese people, and returned to the side of the beloved great leader Chairman Mao in glory.

Victory! The red diplomats' struggle won!

The heroic deeds of the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland are another triumphant march of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛泽东思想的一曲雄壮凯歌
    ——记红色外交战士在印尼抗暴斗争的英雄事迹
    十一月十四日，刚刚从雅加达回到首都、回到毛主席身边的红色外交战士，见到了日夜想念的最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。
    迎着毛主席，这些曾经昂首挺胸、横眉怒对印尼法西斯暴徒枪口的钢铁战士，再也无法抑制自己的感情，个个流下了幸福的热泪。
    迎着毛主席，这些曾经在抗暴斗争中，用鲜血维护了祖国尊严的英雄儿女们，一遍遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    迎着毛主席，这些在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的红色外交战士，心潮澎湃，万分激动，在内心中自语：
    “毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。在抗暴斗争的日日夜夜，我们时时刻刻想念您，是您给了我们勇敢和智慧，是您的光辉思想指引我们取得了斗争的胜利！”
    祖国尊严不可侮！五星红旗不可侮！
    那是十月一日凌晨。在雅加达，中国大使馆这块红色土地上，呈现着一派节日景象。大使馆大厅的中央，毛主席的巨像，光芒四射，明亮的灯光映着厅前的“毛主席万岁”和“庆祝中华人民共和国成立十八周年”的鲜红大字。坚持同印尼反动派进行了长期斗争的二十名中国红色外交战士，胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，心里怀念着毛主席，准备着在大厅的毛主席像前，和祖国人民一起欢度节日，共庆祖国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。
    就在这一刻，一场骇人听闻的国际关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行发生了。以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人政权，为了乞求更多的美元和卢布，为了彻底破坏中国人民同印尼人民在反帝反殖的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊，按照预定的计划，驱使着全副武装的军警和大批暴徒，嘶叫着冲进了不可侵犯的我国驻印尼大使馆。他们挥刀开枪，横冲直闯，无恶不作。
    一场严峻的斗争摆在我国红色外交战士面前。
    祖国的尊严不可侮！用毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国的二十名英雄儿女立即动员起来。他们说：“苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政府特意选择在中国人民的伟大节日国庆节，制造新的法西斯暴行，这是对我们伟大祖国的极端严重的挑衅。我们是毛主席派来的外交战士，我们一定要用生命来维护祖国的尊严。”
    红色外交战士们，各人坚守在自己的岗位上，手拿红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，愤怒高呼：“法西斯暴徒滚出去！”“打倒印尼反动派！”在抗暴斗争中，许多同志受伤了，鲜血流了满身，仍然背诵着毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们望着飘扬在使馆上空的五星红旗，抚摸着佩戴在胸前的毛主席像章，决心和敌人战斗到底。
    在使馆的一侧，黄文胜临时代办和杨正国同志，正在同暴徒进行着英勇的搏斗。突然，一颗子弹飞来，打中黄文胜同志的胸部。黄文胜同志倒在血泊中。不一会，他从昏迷中醒了过来，对着在他身边的杨正国同志说：“小杨，你别管我，去告诉同志们，要坚持斗争到底！”说罢就连连念着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    匪徒们冲到了杨正国同志的身边，用一只酒瓶把他打晕了。就在这时，杨正国同志突然想起，有一面小型的五星红旗还放在桌子上，五星红旗是我们伟大祖国的象征，绝不能让它落在敌人的手里。他挣开了暴徒，猛地扑过去，把五星红旗攥在自己的手里。暴徒们打他，用枪威胁他，要他交出国旗。在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的小杨，英勇不屈，怒斥敌人，终于用鲜血保护了这面鲜红的五星红旗。
    在使馆的另一侧，陈金培和周庆隆等同志不顾暴徒的疯狂射击，顽强地坚守着。在敌人袭击最凶狠的时候，陈金培和周庆隆两同志都受伤了，但是他们仍然斗志昂扬，朗读着毛主席语录，岿然不动。陈金培同志无限热爱毛主席，平时认真学习“老三篇”和毛主席的其他著作，并且学了就照着去干。在印尼反动派掀起反华浪潮以后，他曾经想方设法为大使馆制了三根旗杆。如果印尼暴徒来袭击，一根旗杆被破坏了，伟大祖国的五星红旗，就将迅速从另一根旗杆上庄严升起。他说：“我们人可能被打，财物可能被砸，可是我们的五星红旗，不管在什么时候，都要高高飘扬。”这次，在同暴徒的搏斗中，他的头被打破，鲜血直流，仍然同受了伤的周庆隆同志，相互鼓励，蔑视暴徒，坚持斗争。
    二十名战士，一个个发出钢铁誓言：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！二十名战士，一个个下定决心：祖国的尊严不可侮！五星红旗不可侮！
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的祖国的英雄儿女们，人人大义凛然，个个气盖山河。他们视敌人如粪土，英勇不屈同来犯的暴徒进行搏斗，表现了伟大中国人民大无畏的革命精神，表现了伟大中国人民不可战胜的英雄气概。
    无耻的暴徒越来越多了，他们在印尼反动军官的驱赶下，象一群疯狗，逼近了我红色外交战士。祖国的英雄儿女们，向暴徒们射出仇恨的目光，手挽着手，昂首屹立。他们一遍又一遍地齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”一遍又一遍地齐声朗诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”并且不停地高声喝斥：“法西斯暴徒，滚出中国大使馆！”在我威武不屈的红色外交战士面前，暴徒们个个鼠头贼脑，十分卑劣。
    经过几个小时的抗暴斗争，我二十名红色外交战士已经全部被枪伤或打伤。印尼反动派为了达到洗劫和非法搜查我大使馆的可耻目的，不顾我红色外交战士的强烈抗议，竟强行把我国驻雅加达大使馆全体人员绑架离开大使馆，带到了雅加达陆军中央医院。我红色外交战士清楚地知道：斗争并没有结束。但是，不管印尼反动派施展什么卑鄙手段，玩弄什么阴谋诡计，他们决心实践毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    就在同志们准备新的战斗的时刻，雅加达的钟声响了九下，这时正是北京时间上午十时整。举世瞩目的伟大时刻来到了。二十名战士，忘记了伤口的疼痛，二十名战士，二十颗红心，同祖国七亿人民的心一起跳动。此刻，他们的心飞向伟大祖国的首都，耳边好象响起了《东方红》的乐声，好象看见我们伟大的领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，在欢呼声中健步登上天安门城楼。二十名祖国的儿女是多么激动啊！他们情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛泽东思想武装的战士是不可战胜的
    红色外交战士们想着毛主席，想着伟大的祖国，顿时感到自己有了无穷无尽的力量。他们恨不得马上插上翅膀飞回大使馆，去告诉印尼革命人民，去告诉在印尼的爱国华侨，向他们宣告：一切反华的小丑们，到头来只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士是不可战胜的。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所作的英明论断那样，印尼反动派是一只纸老虎。在有七亿中国人民作后盾的我二十名红色外交战士坚决斗争下，印尼反动派的阴谋遭到了彻底破产。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政府被迫答应了我红色外交战士提出的全部严正要求：立即扯下挂在中国大使馆内的红白旗，立即撤出侵占我使馆的暴徒，负责对我受伤人员进行治疗，立即把我人员送回大使馆。
    胜利了，祖国的英雄儿女们胜利了。
    就在当天夜里，就在伟大祖国人民欢度国庆之夜的时刻，我国红色外交战士，除了几个身负重伤的同志留在医院之外，全部胜利回到大使馆。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。毛主席啊，毛主席！祖国的英雄儿女，是您的思想哺育出来的红色外交战士，祖国英雄儿女的胜利，是您的光辉思想的伟大胜利。回到大使馆门前，红色外交战士们排好队，齐声背诵毛主席关于发扬革命英雄主义精神的教导，庄严地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”口号声冲破雅加达的夜空，动人心魄。
    祖国的英雄儿女们背诵着最高指示走进了大使馆，回到我们伟大祖国的神圣领土上，回到了他们战斗的地方。眼前是一片被劫的景象，使馆的所有建筑物和一切陈设，都被暴徒们糟踏得不成样子。同志们怒火填胸，同时更加提高警惕，准备迎击任何敢于来犯的暴徒，争取更大的胜利。
    红心向着伟大领袖毛主席的外交战士们，找出一张毛主席像，又找了几根木条做了像框，然后高高地挂在大厅正中。大厅里的毛主席语录牌被暴徒毁坏了，同志们找来两块小黑板，用粉笔在上面端端正正地写上毛主席的教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”祖国的英雄儿女们，深情地仰望着毛主席像，一个个坚定地从内心里发出誓言，毛主席啊，毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！看见您，我们眼亮方向明；看见您，我们心红骨头硬。敬爱的毛主席，您老人家放心吧！在严峻的国际阶级斗争的风浪中，我们一定要更好地读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的忠心耿耿的好战士。
    毛主席的话就是我们的斗争纲领
    第二天，东方破晓，红日升起。我红色外交战士来到使馆草坪，升起一面用鲜血保护起来的国旗。五星红旗又在雅加达上空高高飘扬了，她显得格外庄严美丽，她向全世界人民宣告：毛泽东时代的伟大中国不可侮！
    不出所料，印尼法西斯军人政权，又派出了带着机关枪、火箭筒的武装军警，把我大使馆团团围住。从此，我红色外交战士又同印尼反动派展开了反封锁的长期斗争。
    我使馆对外电讯联系被断绝了，外交战士外出的自由横遭剥夺。他们和祖国失去了联系。怎么办呢？大家说：“千难万难，难不住用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士。毛主席的著作就是给我们的最高指示！毛主席的话就是我们的斗争纲领！”从那以后，我红色外交战士更加努力学习毛主席著作，从中汲取无穷的力量。每天天刚亮，祖国的英雄儿女们，就开始阅读毛主席的革命宝书了，有的在背诵“老三篇”，有的在朗读毛主席有关完全彻底为人民的语录。在医院里的几个同志，手里没有毛主席著作，没有《毛主席语录》，他们就依靠记忆，相互背诵，武装自己的头脑，鼓舞自己，鞭策自己同敌人战斗。九天以后，由于使馆同志的斗争，印尼反动政府被迫让使馆的同志来看望他们了。在战友们会见的这一天，使馆的同志给几个重伤员同志带来了毛主席像，带来了心爱的《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。同志们是多么高兴啊，他们把毛主席像挂在自己的床头，把毛主席像章戴在胸前。大家眼含热泪，久久地望着毛主席像，在内心发誓：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
        不愧为伟大祖国的英雄儿女
      “你们的英勇斗争，大长中国人民的志气，大灭美帝走狗印尼反动派的威风。”
      “你们不愧为伟大祖国的英雄儿女，不愧为毛主席的红色外交战士。你们的英雄事迹，给我国全体外事工作人员树立了光辉的榜样。”……
    十月九日，使馆的同志打开收音机，收听祖国的广播，突然听到一个亲切的声音正在播送周恩来总理代表党中央和国务院，在十月七日发出的慰问全体红色外交战士的电文。
    “这是祖国的声音，这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀！”
    刹时间，大使馆沸腾起来了，红色外交战士们热泪滚滚，围着收音机，一字一句仔细倾听着，又一字一句把慰问电文记录下来。
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”同志们久久地捧着慰问电文，激动地高呼无限热爱、无限感激伟大领袖毛主席的口号。当他们从电文中看到“希望你们继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，随时准备迎接更尖锐的斗争，争取更加伟大的胜利”的时候，他们说：“这就是毛主席、党中央和祖国人民对我们的要求，我们坚决执行。”当天夜里，祖国的红色外交战士们，向伟大的领袖毛主席，向祖国人民写下一份决心书。决心书中写道：
      “我们听到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的声音！听到了祖国七亿人民的声音！这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！我们千遍万遍高呼：‘毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！’我们全体同志，坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不论在任何艰难困苦的情况下，决心用自己的鲜血和生命，捍卫祖国的尊严，捍卫毛泽东思想，坚决同印尼反动派斗争到底！”
    胜利了！红色外交战士斗争胜利了！祖国的英雄儿女们带着印尼人民对中国人民的战斗友谊，在十一月三日，光荣地回到了伟大祖国的首都，回到了敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边。
    胜利了！红色外交战士斗争胜利了！祖国英雄儿女的英勇斗争事迹，是毛泽东思想的又一曲壮丽凯歌。
