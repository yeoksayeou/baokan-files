The editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily have published an important article titled "The Struggle Between Two Roads in China's Countryside." This article is excellent! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade all say that this article speaks for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and it is a heavy blow to Liu Shaoqi; it will push the revolutionary criticism movement in our countryside to a broader and deeper new stage.

Liu Shaoqi is the enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants. For a long time, he has opposed us poor and lower-middle peasants from taking the socialist road, claiming that "in many places, even the cadres, the peasants demand individual farming, demand the distribution of land to households, or contract production to households." Pfft! This is all nonsense, this is a great slander against our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, with each family as a production unit. This dispersed individual production is the economic foundation of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives."

In the old society, our village was famous for being poor. In the entire village of ninety households, more than seventy had coarse grains and vegetables for half a year's food, and they could not eat their fill or wear warm clothes. Many people were driven to desperation, separated from their families, and their homes and lives were destroyed.

Fortunately, we welcomed the savior Chairman Mao, who led us poor and lower-middle peasants to overthrow the landlords and rich peasants, distribute the houses and land, seize the power, and achieve a great political liberation. We were overjoyed and ecstatic, thinking that our days would be better from now on.

However, a few years later, our village saw a polarization, and some poor and lower-middle peasants returned to the path of poverty. At that time, we were puzzled: after the land reform, why were there phenomena of hiring labor and buying and selling land? Now we understand, originally these landlords, rich peasants, and rich middle peasants with capitalist tendencies had Liu Shaoqi backing them. Soon after the land reform, Liu Shaoqi eagerly shouted: "The policy of preserving the rich peasant economy" is a "long-term policy," claiming that hiring people to farm "should not be restricted." This is a thoroughly reactionary fallacy. What "should not be restricted"? It means not restricting the development of capitalism, not restricting landlords and rich peasants from continuing to exploit us poor and lower-middle peasants!

Our great leader Chairman Mao understands and cares the most about us poor and lower-middle peasants. He pointed out: "Implementing collectivization, eliminating the rich peasant economic system and individual economy in the countryside, and making all rural people prosperous together." Chairman Mao's words are like a bright lamp, illuminating our poor and lower-middle peasants, and we found the direction to move forward.

In the spring of 1955, twenty-six households of poor and lower-middle peasants in our village responded to Chairman Mao's great call and established a primary cooperative, and that year we had a bumper harvest, demonstrating unparalleled superiority. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Following Chairman Mao's words is correct."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself." Our victory caused the panic and hatred of the class enemies. Liu Shaoqi saw that his dream of developing the rich peasant economy in China had not come true, and saw that the enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for the socialist road had risen, and he was scared to death and hated to death. Thus, in desperation, he shouted that the masses establishing cooperatives was "rush and blind advance," slandering the promotion of agricultural mutual aid teams to cooperatives as "a wrong, dangerous, and utopian agricultural socialist thought." He colluded with another major capitalist-roader within the party and a handful of right-opportunists to severely cut down on cooperatives, sabotage the collective economy, and attempt to drag the poor and lower-middle peasants back to the old road of suffering and hunger.

Chairman Mao teaches us that agricultural collectivization is the necessary path for the broad masses of peasants "to go from poverty to prosperity." We firmly advance along the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, and in 1958 we established the people's commune.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." During the three years of temporary economic difficulties in our country, Liu Shaoqi, in collaboration with the domestic and foreign class enemies' anti-China chorus, attempted to reverse the wheel of history. He said things like "industry should retreat sufficiently, and agriculture should also retreat sufficiently, including contract production to households and individual farming," "free markets should continue," "don't be afraid of the spread of capitalism." This completely exposed his wolfish ambition to restore capitalism. Under his incitement, his agents in the countryside, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, all came out, and a black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" blew fiercely, and the counter-revolutionary arrogance was extremely rampant.

If we follow Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, we poor and lower-middle peasants will go back on the old road and suffer twice. Liu Shaoqi loves capitalism and hates socialism; he is the enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants!

Let me tell you, Liu Shaoqi! Your plots will never succeed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, and they listen to Chairman Mao the most. The socialist bright path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely walk, and we will walk forever!

### 中国赫鲁晓夫是贫农下中农的死对头

    中国赫鲁晓夫是贫农下中农的死对头
    北京市平谷县山东庄公社桥头营大队革命委员会主任　李树金
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部发表了重要文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》。这篇文章好得很！我们大队广大贫下中农都说，这篇文章说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，是打中了中国赫鲁晓夫要害的一发重型炮弹；它将把我们农村的革命大批判运动，推向更广阔、更深入的新阶段。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是我们贫下中农的死对头。长期以来，他反对贫下中农走社会主义道路，胡说什么“许多地方的农民，甚至于干部，要求单干，要求分田到户，或者包产到户。”呸！这完全是胡说八道，这是对我们广大贫下中农的极大污蔑。
    毛主席教导我们：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社。”
    在旧社会，我们村是有名的穷村。全村九十户人家，就有七十多户糠菜半年粮，吃不饱穿不暖。许多人被逼得走投无路，妻离子散，家破人亡。
    多亏盼来了救星毛主席，领导我们贫下中农斗倒了地主、富农，分了房，分了地，夺得了印把子，政治上得到了大翻身。我们欢欣鼓舞，兴高采烈，心里想，以后的日子就好过了。
    可是，没过几年，我们村出现了两极分化，有些贫下中农又重新走上了贫困的道路。那时候，我们心里纳闷：搞了土改，怎么又有雇工剥削、买卖土地的现象呢？现在才明白，原来这些地主、富农和具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农，有中国赫鲁晓夫给他们撑腰。土改不久，中国赫鲁晓夫就迫不及待地叫嚷：“保存富农经济的政策”“是一种长期的政策”，胡说什么雇人种地“不要限制”。这是反动透顶的谬论。什么“不要限制”？就是不要限制发展资本主义，就是不要限制地主、富农继续剥削我们贫下中农！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最了解最关心我们贫下中农，他老人家指出：“实行合作化，在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度，使全体农村人民共同富裕起来。”毛主席的话象一盏明灯，照得我们贫下中农心明眼亮，找到了前进的方向。
    一九五五年春，我们村二十六户贫下中农，响应毛主席的伟大号召，办起了初级合作社，当年就得到大丰收，显示了无比的优越性。贫下中农说：“听毛主席的话，没错。”
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”我们的胜利，引起了阶级敌人的惊慌和仇恨。中国赫鲁晓夫看到要在中国发展富农经济的美梦没做成，看到广大贫下中农走社会主义道路的积极性起来了，怕得要死，恨得要死。于是狗急跳墙，大喊群众办合作社是“盲目冒进”，污蔑要把农业互助组提高到合作社是“一种错误的、危险的、空想的农业社会主义思想”。他伙同党内另一个最大的走资派，伙同一小撮右倾机会主义分子大砍合作社，破坏集体经济，妄图把贫下中农拉回到受苦挨饿的老路上去。
    毛主席教导我们农业合作化是广大农民“由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。我们坚定地朝着毛主席指引的光明大道前进，在一九五八年建立了人民公社。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”在我国三年暂时经济困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫配合国内外阶级敌人的反华大合唱，要想扭转历史车轮。胡说什么“工业上要退够，农业上也要退够，包括包产到户、单干”，“自由市场还要搞下去”，“不要怕资本主义泛滥”。这就彻头彻尾地暴露了他妄想复辟资本主义的狼子野心。在他的鼓吹下，他在农村的代理人，以及地、富、反、坏分子纷纷出笼，大刮“三自一包”的黑风，反革命气焰非常嚣张。
    如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫这一套反革命修正主义路线搞下去，我们贫下中农就会走回头路，受二遍苦。中国赫鲁晓夫爱的是资本主义，恨的是社会主义，他是我们贫下中农的死对头！
    告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫！你的阴谋永远也不能得逞。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，心最红，眼最亮，最听毛主席的话，毛主席指引的社会主义阳关大道我们走定了，永远走定了！
