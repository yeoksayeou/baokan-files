The revolutionary workers of Shuangyashan Station in Heilongjiang Province, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, have been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on revolution and promoting production. For several months, they have continuously completed their transportation tasks ahead of schedule.

This station is responsible for transporting coal produced in the Shuangyashan mining area to various parts of the country. In recent months, the revolutionary masses of the Shuangyashan mining area have directed the boundless enthusiasm released during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into coal production. The output of raw coal has surged, sometimes exceeding the state plan by more than 80 percent. The excellent situation in coal production has presented new demands for railway transportation at Shuangyashan Station. Some people thought that completing such a large volume of transportation without increasing locomotives and manpower was impossible. Under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region, the revolutionary masses of Shuangyashan Station have emphasized proletarian politics, taken "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, promoted the thought revolutionization of the people, and fully unleashed the tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses. They launched a thorough criticism and rectification movement, criticizing the revisionist line long advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents, and breaking the shackles of foreign dogmas and old frameworks that restricted the masses. The thorough criticism and rectification movement greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses put "public" first, "dare" first, and "revolution" first. The entire station presented an unprecedented vibrant scene, and many difficulties were solved. They pooled their wisdom, broke old regulations, fully mobilized all positive factors, and formulated a transportation plan to ensure that the amount of coal produced is the amount transported. Many drivers, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, insisted on pulling more and faster, solving the problem of insufficient locomotives.

To ensure the smooth completion of the coal transportation task, the revolutionary workers of this station also actively coordinated with the mining area to hold "cooperation meetings." The dispatchers went to various mines to conduct in-depth investigations and research, making sure to understand the situation thoroughly and have a clear mind, ensuring the needs of the mining area without wasting rolling stock. In the past, dispatchers only cared about their own "section," as long as their own "section" did not have problems. Now, dispatchers take responsibility for the revolutionary cause as a whole and actively implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They strive to compile more cars, compile faster, compile direct trains, and strive to ensure production and save rolling stock.

    双鸭山车站职工狠抓革命猛促生产
    矿区产多少煤　列车运多少煤
    在解放军同志帮助下，连续几个月提前完成运输任务
    据新华社哈尔滨电  黑龙江省双鸭山车站的革命职工，在黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，几个月来连续提前完成运输任务。
    这个车站担负着将双鸭山矿区所产的煤运往全国的任务。近几个月来，双鸭山矿区无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到煤炭生产上，原煤产量一跃再跃，有时日产量超过国家计划百分之八十多。煤炭生产的大好形势，对双鸭山车站铁路运输提出了新的要求。有人认为，要完成这样大的运输量，不增加机车和人力是不可能的。双鸭山车站无产阶级革命派在黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，突出无产阶级政治，以“斗私，批修”为纲，促进人的思想革命化，把革命群众中蕴藏的巨大革命积极性充分发挥出来，保证了煤炭运输任务的顺利完成。他们发动广大革命群众深入开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。广大革命职工狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人长期以来推行的修正主义路线，大破束缚群众手脚的洋教条、旧框框。革命的大批判和斗批改，极大地促进了革命群众的思想革命化。广大革命职工“公”字当头、“敢”字当头、“革”字当头，全车站出现了前所未有的朝气蓬勃的局面，许多困难迎刃而解。他们集思广益，打破旧规章，充分调动各方面积极因素，订出确保矿区产多少运多少的运输计划。许多司机不怕苦，不怕累，坚持多拉快跑，解决了机车不足的困难。
    为了保证煤炭运输任务顺利完成，这个车站的革命职工还主动同矿区联系召开“协作会”。车站调度人员分头下到各矿井，进行深入的调查研究，做到摸清底，心里有数，既保证矿区需要，又不浪费车皮。过去调度员各管“一段”，只要自己“一段”不出问题就行了。现在调度员都为革命的全局负责，积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们想方设法，多编车，快编车，编直达列车，努力保证生产，节约车皮。
