In the midst of the revolutionary criticism movement, many families of workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company held revolutionary criticism meetings. From children as young as ten to elderly people with white hair, everyone actively participated in the revolutionary criticism movement. This situation powerfully demonstrates that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and the broad masses have truly been mobilized.

The family criticism meetings first appeared in the magnesite mine of Dashiqiao, which is affiliated with Anshan Steel. During the high tide of revolutionary criticism, some revolutionary workers in this mine organized their families to hold revolutionary criticism meetings, with the entire family gathering together to criticize and repudiate revisionism. This form of family criticism meeting quickly spread. Recently, the Anshan Steel Defense of Mao Zedong Thought Battle Headquarters held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of revolutionary workers in Dashiqiao holding family criticism meetings. Now, more and more Anshan Steel workers are holding family criticism meetings.

These family criticism meetings are mostly held on weekends or after dinner. The forms of family criticism meetings are varied. Some families gather together to criticize and repudiate revisionism; some invite relatives and friends to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism; some neighbors join together to criticize revisionism.

The holding of family criticism meetings has deepened the understanding of revolutionary workers and their families about the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, raising their class consciousness. Many workers and their families, through family criticism meetings, further recognized the heinous crimes of the clique headed by the Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism, and further understood the great significance of consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Some children as young as ten and some elderly women in their sixties and seventies can powerfully criticize the fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is beneficial." They all expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, to follow Chairman Mao, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Through family criticism meetings, revolutionary workers and their families have developed a deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. With profound class feelings, they eagerly study the works of Chairman Mao, creating a high tide of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many workers and their families, including some children as young as six or seven, can now recite "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and some can recite the entire "Three Articles." They not only can recite Chairman Mao's works but also put Chairman Mao's teachings into practice.

Holding family criticism meetings has also promoted the thought reform of workers and their families. In the past, some families focused on food and clothing and appearance, but now such phenomena are rare. Families that care about the collective, care about state affairs, and care about revolution and production are becoming more and more common.

### 毛泽东思想深入人心，群众充分发动起来了  鞍钢职工家庭摆战场  深入开展革命大批判

    毛泽东思想深入人心，群众充分发动起来了
    鞍钢职工家庭摆战场  深入开展革命大批判
    新华社鞍山九日电　在革命大批判的高潮中，鞍山钢铁公司的许多职工家庭举行革命批判会，从十来岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，都自觉地投入了革命大批判运动。这个情况有力地表明，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经深入人心，广大群众真正发动起来了。
    家庭批判会最先是在鞍钢所属大石桥镁矿出现的。在革命大批判高潮中，这个矿一些革命职工带动家属举行革命批判会，全家老小聚在一起，斗私批修。这种家庭批判会一出现，发展很快。最近，鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部召开现场会议，推广了大石桥镁矿革命职工举行家庭批判会的经验。现在，鞍钢职工举行家庭批判会的越来越多了。
    这种家庭批判会，大多利用星期假日或晚饭后的时间进行。家庭批判会的形式多种多样。有的一家老小共聚一堂斗私批修；有的邀请亲友忆苦思甜，批判中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行；有的邻里联合起来批判修正主义。
    家庭批判会的举行，使革命职工和家属对毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义有了较深刻的理解，提高了阶级觉悟。许多职工和家属，通过家庭批判会，进一步认清了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，进一步认识到巩固和加强无产阶级专政的重大意义。一些十来岁的小孩，六七十岁的老妈妈，都能有力地批判中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“剥削有功”等谬论。他们纷纷表示，坚决听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    通过家庭批判会，革命职工和家属对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想更加热爱。他们怀着深厚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，出现了大学大用毛主席著作的高潮。许多职工和家属，包括有些六、七岁的小孩，现在都能熟背《为人民服务》，有的能背全部“老三篇”。他们不但能背诵毛主席著作，并且把毛主席的教导贯彻到行动中去。
    举行家庭批判会，还促进了职工和家属的思想革命化。过去，一些家庭那种论吃穿、讲穿戴的现象少见了，关心集体，关心国家大事，关心抓革命、促生产的家庭越来越多。
