Indian reactionaries, in collusion with Indian revisionists, have launched a counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign to extinguish the revolutionary flames of Naxalbari. However, the revolutionary spirit of the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) and the revolutionary peasants remains undaunted as they continue their armed struggle.

New Delhi, November 4 (Xinhua) — Despite the brutal suppression by the Indian reactionary government, in collusion with Indian revisionists, against the armed struggle of peasants in Naxalbari, the leaders of this movement, the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary), and the revolutionary peasants remain undeterred and continue their struggle to welcome the new revolutionary storm.

The Indian reactionary government carried out ruthless suppression against the uprising peasants in Naxalbari in July, August, and September. It dispatched large numbers of police to the area to establish numerous outposts and conducted house-to-house searches, arresting over 1,300 members of the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) and peasant associations who participated in the uprising. In addition to suppression, the Indian reactionary government also employed deception to soften the resolve of the uprising peasants. Police authorities held public meetings in areas where armed struggles occurred, with officials falsely promising to "immediately resolve" disputes between peasants and landlords, urging peasants to hand over disputes to county authorities for "resolution" rather than handling them "arbitrarily." The Indian reactionaries attempted to use such empty promises to lure peasants into abandoning their struggle against landlords.

The Indian reactionary government also exploited Indian revisionists to serve their purposes. The revisionist faction of the Communist Party of India collaborated with the reactionaries, persecuting party members who supported the Naxalbari struggle, expelling two-thirds of the party members in Darjeeling County. Hare Krishna Konar, the Minister of Land and Revenue of West Bengal, a revisionist of the Communist Party of India, closely cooperated with the police authorities, visiting prisoners to persuade the leaders of the peasant movement to surrender.

However, the counter-revolutionary tactics of suppression and deception by the Indian reactionaries and Indian revisionists failed to extinguish the revolutionary flames and could not shake the determination and confidence of the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) and the revolutionary peasants in their struggle.

According to a report by the weekly "Lightning," the Indian reactionary government still cannot capture the main leaders of the Naxalbari movement. The police authorities confirmed that one of the main leaders of the movement is currently active in the Naxalbari area, "holding secret meetings with the main members of the peasant association every night." The police have tried hard to capture him but are "powerless" because the leader's "counter-intelligence activities are far more effective than the police." Once, the police raided a forest area they believed to be hiding the revolutionary leader at dawn, but found it empty as the leader and his comrades had already left.

The members of the peasant associations in the area also remain confident and continue their struggle. A reporter from the weekly "Lightning" who recently visited Naxalbari reported that the awareness of the peasant association members under the leadership of the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) in the area "has far surpassed their immediate economic demands," and they "understand the meaning of armed struggle." The "Statesman" revealed that the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) "has developed a strong core of steadfast workers among the peasants," who believe that "class struggle in rural areas will inevitably be arduous, and initial setbacks due to police suppression will lead to powerful armed uprisings and the seizure of power."

According to Indian newspapers, the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) and the revolutionary peasants are tenaciously continuing their struggle.

An article from the "Statesman" correspondent in Naxalbari stated that the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) "is still on the path of war." A reactionary politician from the United Socialist Party who went to Naxalbari to gather intelligence in late September revealed that the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) in Naxalbari "is still very active," and he worriedly said, "Unless the police remain vigilant at all times, new troubles may arise in Naxalbari." A leader of the Indian National Congress who went to Naxalbari also revealed that the revolutionary peasants in Naxalbari "are reorganizing underground movements," and they "continue to raise the slogan of 'Mao Zedong Thought.'"

Currently, the police authorities are very afraid that there may be "new troubles" during the harvest season starting at the end of November. The peasants who participated in the Naxalbari uprising "may once again collectively refuse to share crops with landlords."

Moreover, Indian newspaper reports reveal that the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) in Darjeeling County and West Bengal, and even in the northern state, are actively expanding their revolutionary forces under the inspiration of the Naxalbari movement.

A reactionary official in Darjeeling County exclaimed that almost all the communists in Darjeeling County have abandoned the revisionist leadership and sided with the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary). In many other areas of West Bengal, the revolutionary faction "has already gained considerable strength."

The "Ganesh Market Report" reported that in late September, the West Bengal government "received reports from various places in Darjeeling County about organized attempts to seize land in the manner similar to that in Naxalbari."

According to the "Hindustan Times," over 200 agricultural workers and landless peasants began occupying over 300 acres of surplus land in the Langviu area of the Karson district, about 15 miles from the Naxalbari area, on October 19. They hoisted red flags and camped on the occupied land. The newspaper exclaimed that currently, this area "has once again become a headache for the police authorities."

The "Indian Express" reported that the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) in the northern state proposed the slogan of "collecting weapons and selecting areas," actively preparing to take root in rural areas and establish bases to take mass actions to safeguard the legitimate rights of farmers and workers.

The "Statesman" recently reported that the committee supporting the Naxalbari peasant struggle held a conference in Calcutta in early September, calling on Indian peasants to abandon the old methods of demonstrating in front of the government and parliament, and to organize peasant committees to prevent large landlords from harvesting crops. Peasant committees should seize the rice and paddy hoarded by large landlords and distribute them to the local people. Speakers at the conference especially pointed out that "the peasants of Naxalbari have chosen the correct path by launching struggles to achieve 'land to the tiller.'" The conference passed a resolution condemning the West Bengal "non-Congress" state government's attitude towards the Naxalbari movement as reactionary.

Great Leader Chairman Mao taught us: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national disasters; but such rampancy not only indicates that these dark forces still have strength, but also indicates their last struggles, indicating that the masses of the people are gradually approaching victory. This is the case in China, in the entire East, and in the world."

The Indian reactionaries, in collusion with Indian revisionists, launched a large-scale counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" campaign in Naxalbari, but failed to extinguish the peasants' revolutionary struggle and could not stop the development of revolutionary forces. On the contrary, it has raised the awareness of the Indian people and strengthened their revolutionary resolve. The revolutionary path of Naxalbari, which the Communist Party of India (Revolutionary) insists on, will ultimately achieve complete victory in India.

    印度反动派勾结印修分子发动反革命“围剿”扑灭不了纳萨尔巴里革命烈火
    印共革命派和革命农民斗志昂扬坚持武装斗争

    新华社讯　新德里消息：尽管印度反动政府勾结印度修正主义分子，玩弄反革命两手，对纳萨尔巴里的农民武装斗争进行了极为残暴的镇压，但领导这个运动的印共革命派和革命农民依然斗志昂扬，为迎接新的革命风暴而坚持斗争。
    印度反动政府在七、八、九月份对纳萨尔巴里起义农民进行了残酷镇压。它派出大批警察到这个地区去建立了许多据点，挨村挨户进行搜捕，逮捕了一千三百多名参加起义的印共革命派和农会会员。除了采取镇压一手外，印度反动政府还采用欺骗的一手来软化起义农民。警察当局在发生武装斗争的地区举行公众集会，由官方出面假惺惺地许诺农民“立即解决”他们同地主之间的纠纷，要求农民把纠纷交给县当局“解决”，而不要“随意处理”。印度反动派妄图用这种空洞的诺言，诱骗农民放弃对地主的斗争。
    印度反动政府还利用印度修正主义分子为他们效劳。印共修正主义分子配合反动派，对支持纳萨尔巴里斗争的党员进行迫害，把大吉岭县占全部党员人数三分之二的党员开除出党。西孟加拉邦政府的土地和税收部长、印共修正主义分子哈雷·克里希纳·科纳，密切配合警察当局，到狱中去向农民运动的领导人进行诱降。
    但是，印度反动派和印度修正主义分子的镇压和欺骗的反革命两手，都扑灭不了革命的火焰，也无法动摇印共革命派和革命农民的斗争决心和信心。
    据《闪电》周报报道，到现在，印度反动政府仍然抓不到纳萨尔巴里运动的主要领导人。警察当局证实，运动的一位主要领导人现在正在纳萨尔巴里地区积极活动，“每天晚上同农民协会的主要成员举行秘密会议”。警方极力设法抓他，但是“无能为力”，因为这位领导人的“反谍报活动的效力远远超过警方”。有一次，警察在清晨袭击了他们认为革命派领导人隐藏的丛林地区，但是，警察到达那里时，却扑了一个空，运动领导人和他的伙伴已经离开了。
    那里的农民协会会员也依然信心十足地坚持斗争。最近访问过纳萨尔巴里的一名《闪电》周报记者报道，在这个地区印共革命派领导下的农民协会会员的觉悟，“已经远远超过了他们眼前的经济要求”，“他们懂得武装斗争的含意”。《政治家报》透露，印共革命派“在农民中发展了一个由坚定的工作者组成的坚强的核心”，他们相信，“农村地区的阶级斗争必然是艰苦的，由于警察镇压，在最初阶段必然有的挫折，将导致强大的武装起义和夺取政权。”
    据印度报纸透露，印共革命派和革命农民顽强地坚持着斗争。
    《政治家报》记者发自纳萨尔巴里的一篇文章说，印共革命派“仍然在走战争的道路”。一名曾在九月下旬去纳萨尔巴里刺探情报的统一社会党的反动政客透露，印共革命派在纳萨尔巴里“仍然很活跃”，他忧心忡忡地说：“除非警察经常保持警戒，否则在纳萨尔巴里可能会爆发新的麻烦”。一名国大党头目去纳萨尔巴里活动后也透露，纳萨尔巴里的革命农民“正在再次组织地下运动”，他们“继续在提‘毛泽东主义’的口号”。
    现在警察当局非常害怕在十一月底开始的割稻季节“再次出乱子”。参加纳萨尔巴里起义农民，“可能再次集体拒绝同地主分庄稼”。
    不仅如此，印度报纸的报道还透露，大吉岭县各地和西孟加拉邦、乃至北方邦的印共革命派正在纳萨尔巴里运动的鼓舞下积极展开斗争，扩展革命力量。
    大吉岭县的一个反动官员惊呼，大吉岭县的共产党人几乎已经全部抛弃了修正主义的领导而站到印共革命派方面来。在西孟加拉邦的其他许多地区，革命派“已经拥有很大的力量”。
    《甘露市场报》报道，在九月下旬，西孟加拉邦政府“从大吉岭县各地收到了关于发生类似在纳萨尔巴里进行的那种方式的有组织地试图强占土地的运动的报告”。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》报道，二百多名农业工人和无地农民从十月十九日开始，在大吉岭县离纳萨尔巴里地区只有十五英里的克尔宋大区的朗维尤地区，强行占据了朗维尤种植园的三百多英亩剩余土地。他们在占领的土地上挂起了红旗，并在那里露营。这家报纸惊呼，目前，这个地区“又成为警察当局头痛的问题”。
    《印度快报》报道，北方邦的印共革命派提出了“收集武器和选择地区”的口号，积极准备到农村地区扎根和建立根据地，以便采取群众行动，保障农民、工人的合法权利。
    《政治家报》不久前报道，支持纳萨尔巴里农民斗争委员会九月初在加尔各答举行的一次大会上，号召印度农民们抛弃过去在政府、议会等前面举行示威等老方法，而要组织农民委员会，以阻止大地主收获农作物。农民委员会应该没收大地主囤积的大米和稻子，分发给当地人民。在大会上发言的人特别指出，“纳萨尔巴里的农民们通过发动斗争来实现耕者有其田，是选择了正确的道路。”大会通过一项决议，谴责西孟加拉“非国大党”邦政府对纳萨尔巴里运动的态度是反动的。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。这在中国是如此，在整个东方也是如此，在世界也是如此。”
    印度反动派勾结印度修正主义分子，在纳萨尔巴里进行的大规模的反革命“围剿”，扑灭不了农民的革命斗争，也阻挡不了革命力量的发展，相反，提高了印度人民的觉悟，加强了他们革命的决心。印共革命派坚持的纳萨尔巴里革命道路，最终将在印度取得彻底胜利。
