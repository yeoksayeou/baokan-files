Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Hainan Island, an important base for subtropical cash crops in China, has seen significant increases in the planting area and yield of many major subtropical crops, surpassing any previous year. The renowned Wuzhishan red tea production has nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. Over 200,000 mu of oil palms are thriving, with 80,000 mu already in bloom and bearing fruit, yielding a good harvest. The pepper cultivated collectively by rural people's communes has exceeded the total area planted since liberation by several times.

    海南岛亚热带经济作物获得好收成
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动的推动下，我国亚热带经济作物重要基地海南岛，许多主要的亚热带作物种植面积和产量都大大超过以往任何一年。著名的五指山红茶比去年同期增长近一倍。二十几万亩油棕长势喜人，有八万亩已开花结果，收成良好。农村人民公社集体种植的胡椒，面积超过了解放后十几年的总和。
