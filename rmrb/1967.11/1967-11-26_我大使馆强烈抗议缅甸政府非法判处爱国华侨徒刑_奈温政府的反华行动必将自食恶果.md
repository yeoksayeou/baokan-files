	The Chinese Embassy Strongly Protests the Illegal Sentencing of Patriotic Overseas Chinese by the Burmese Government
	The Ne Win Government's Anti-China Actions Will Surely Backfire

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, Yangon: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, strongly protesting the Burmese government's disregard for multiple warnings from the Chinese Embassy and its brazen sentencing of innocent patriotic overseas Chinese students, including Yang Dehong, on the 18th of November.

	In the note, the Chinese Embassy reiterated that the patriotic overseas Chinese students Yang Dehong, Tan Tingwei, Jiang Qijian, Jiang Rulin, Li Shaocheng, and the patriotic overseas Chinese youth Li Panhua, Lin Yongchun, and Zeng Guangbin are completely innocent. The note sternly pointed out that the Burmese government's unreasonable sentencing of innocent patriotic overseas Chinese students is a serious political persecution of the students and a deliberate step to further deteriorate relations between the two countries.

	The note pointed out that it is well known that the Burmese government has deliberately sabotaged relations between China and Burma, unreasonably depriving overseas Chinese in Burma of their legitimate rights to love their leaders and their homeland; restricting patriotic overseas Chinese youth from loving their leaders and their homeland. The Burmese government then used this as an excuse to orchestrate and organize inhumane fascist atrocities against the Chinese, organizing mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy, killing Chinese experts, and injuring Chinese diplomatic personnel. Now, the Burmese government has illegally sentenced innocent patriotic overseas Chinese students, while the true culprits remain at large. The Burmese government's despicable actions will only backfire, and they will reap what they sow. The Chinese Embassy solemnly warned the Burmese government to repent and demanded that the Burmese government immediately release the patriotic overseas Chinese students Yang Dehong and others unconditionally.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 24th, Yangon: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd, strongly protesting the Burmese government's illegal arrest and sentencing of Chinese nationals Zhao Runqi and seven others.

	The note stated that Zhao Runqi, Yang Jinnan, Lai Paul, Ye Fucheng, and four others are Chinese nationals residing in Burma. During the Burmese government's rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, the Burmese government directed thousands of mobs armed with weapons to attack their workplaces and residences, putting their lives in danger. They had attempted to go to the Chinese Embassy to handle repatriation procedures, but the Burmese military police and secret agents blocked the Chinese Embassy, making it impossible for them to handle the proper repatriation procedures.

	The note stated that under these circumstances, they had no choice but to travel together by land to return to China. However, the Burmese government illegally arrested them on July 21st and thereafter, subjected them to torture and illegal interrogation in prison, and illegally sentenced them to three years in prison on November 13th.

	The note sternly pointed out that the Chinese nationals Zhao Runqi and seven others are completely innocent. The Burmese government's court trial and sentencing of them are completely illegal. The Chinese people and government express great indignation over this and demand that the Burmese government immediately release Zhao Runqi and the seven others unconditionally, allowing them to handle formal procedures to return to China.

    我大使馆强烈抗议缅甸政府非法判处爱国华侨徒刑
    奈温政府的反华行动必将自食恶果
    据新华社二十四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十二日照会缅甸外交部，对缅甸政府不顾中国大使馆的多次警告，在十一月十八日悍然把无辜爱国华侨学生杨德荣等判处严刑提出强烈的抗议。
    中国大使馆在照会中再一次重申，爱国华侨学生杨德荣、谭廷伟、江启建、江儒林、李绍崧及爱国华侨青年李泮华和林永春、曾广斌等人完全是无罪的。照会严正指出，缅甸政府无理判处无辜爱国华侨学生徒刑是对华侨学生的极为严重的政治迫害，同时也是蓄意进一步恶化两国关系的严重步骤。
    照会指出，众所周知，是缅甸政府蓄意破坏中缅两国关系，无理剥夺旅缅华侨热爱自己的领袖和祖国的正当权利；限制爱国华侨青年热爱自己的领袖和祖国的活动。缅甸政府又以此为借口，一手策划和组织了对华侨的惨无人道的法西斯暴行，组织暴徒袭击中国大使馆，杀死中国专家，砍伤中国外交人员。现在缅甸政府竟对无辜的爱国华侨学生非法判刑，而真正的罪魁祸首却逍遥法外。缅甸政府的卑鄙行径只能搬起石头砸自己的脚，自食其果。中国大使馆在照会中郑重地警告缅甸政府必须幡然悔悟，并要求缅甸政府立即把爱国华侨学生杨德荣等无条件释放。
    据新华社二十四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十三日照会缅甸外交部，对缅甸政府非法逮捕中国侨民赵润畦等七人和对他们非法判处徒刑提出强烈的抗议。
    照会说，赵润畦、杨基南、赖保罗、叶福清等七人都是旅居缅甸的中国侨民。在缅甸政府猖狂反华排华暴行中，缅甸政府指使成千暴徒带着凶器袭击他们的工作单位和住宅，使他们的生命安全毫无保障。他们曾经设法来中国大使馆办理回国手续，但缅甸政府的军警特务又层层封锁中国大使馆，无法办理正当回国手续。
    照会说，在这种情况下，他们不得不结伴从陆路回国。然而缅甸政府在七月二十一日和以后非法逮捕了他们，在狱中对他们进行拷打和非法审讯，并于十一月十三日对他们非法判处三年徒刑。
    照会严正指出，中国侨民赵润畦等七人是完全无罪的。缅甸政府法庭审讯和判处他们徒刑是完全非法的。中国人民和中国政府对此表示极大的愤慨，并且要求缅甸政府立即无条件释放赵润畦等七人，让他们办理正式手续回国。
