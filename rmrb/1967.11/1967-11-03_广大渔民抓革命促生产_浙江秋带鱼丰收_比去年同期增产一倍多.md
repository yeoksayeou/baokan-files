Fishermen along the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, inspired by the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for production. By October 20, they had produced over 400,000 dan of autumn hairtail, more than double the amount produced in the same period last year.

In the past year and a half of the Cultural Revolution, the fishermen have diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "Three Constantly Read Articles," promoting their ideological revolution. They have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, using the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as their weapon, exposing and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang who attempted to restore capitalism in the fishing areas. They have resolutely eliminated the revisionist poison of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party who promoted material incentives in fishery production. This has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the fishermen to improve collective production.

    广大渔民抓革命促生产
    浙江秋带鱼丰收
    比去年同期增产一倍多
    新华社杭州三十一日电　浙江省沿海渔区的无产阶级革命派和广大渔民，在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的鼓舞下，生产积极性空前高涨，到十月二十日已生产秋带鱼四十多万担，比去年同期产量增加一倍以上。
    广大渔民在一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，大学“老三篇”，促进了思想革命化。他们高举革命的批判大旗，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，愤怒揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人妄图在渔区复辟资本主义的种种罪行，坚决肃清党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在渔业生产上大搞物质刺激等修正主义流毒，从而进一步激发了广大渔民搞好集体生产的积极性。
