Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the educational revolution have pointed out a revolutionary course for us to establish a new socialist educational system. This is a new call to battle. We must definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to practice and daring to create, and become pioneers of the proletarian educational revolution.

In July of this year, all the revolutionary teachers and students of our school followed Chairman Mao's great call to "resume classes and make revolution," acting swiftly and with great revolutionary enthusiasm, we threw ourselves into the battle of the educational revolution. For more than a decade, our school has been a battleground between two lines. One line is to rely on a few "experts" and "authorities" to close the doors and create a bourgeois educational system that is detached from politics and from workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is how the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within our party have done it. The other line is to mobilize the masses, trust and rely on the broad revolutionary teachers and students, combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and create a socialist educational system for the postal and telecommunications industry that serves workers, peasants, and soldiers and serves proletarian politics.

Those bourgeois intellectuals, "authorities," and "experts" have been forcefully instilling into students the idea that "postal and telecommunications mainly serve the cities, the countryside doesn't need it," "facing the countryside is correct, but what use are college students in the countryside?" This is essentially the question of what kind of successors to the postal and telecommunications industry we are cultivating, and for whom the postal and telecommunications industry serves. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing to and actually combine with the workers and peasants." "Our country has over 500 million agricultural population. The situation of the peasants is of great importance to the development of our economy and the consolidation of our political power." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we are determined to face the grassroots, go deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, send out a batch of educational revolution investigation teams, go deep into the countryside, factories, and postal and telecommunications departments, conduct pilot studies and investigations, learn from workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, shift our foothold to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and together with them carry out the educational revolution, burying the revisionist educational system.

Our investigation, exploration, and pilot teams have been active in factories and rural communes, humbly learning from revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Along the way, they conducted investigations and visits, and organized short-term training classes for switchboard operators and broadcasters, learning from each other and exchanging experiences. The poor and lower-middle peasants welcomed them warmly, calling them "red electricians from Beijing."

Through investigations and pilot studies, we have deeply realized that to make education serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. We firmly rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers of the entire school, break down the old and establish the new, carry forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, and build a brand-new proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We will advance courageously along the course of the proletarian educational revolution charted by Chairman Mao!

    沿着毛主席指引的教育航道前进
    北京邮电学院革命委员会
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，给我们指出了创立一个新的社会主义教育制度的革命航道，是新的战斗号召。我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，发扬敢于实践、敢于创造的革命精神，做无产阶级教育革命的闯将。
    今年七月份，我们全院革命师生遵循毛主席发出的“复课闹革命”的伟大号召，雷厉风行，以极大的革命热情投入了教育革命的战斗。十几年来，我院一直存在着两条路线的斗争。一条是只靠少数“专家”、“权威”闭门造车，搞出一个脱离政治，脱离工农兵的资产阶级教育制度。中国的赫鲁晓夫和我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就是这样搞的。另一条是放手发动群众，相信和依靠广大革命师生，和工农兵相结合，创造出一个使邮电为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的社会主义邮电事业的教育制度。
    那些资产阶级知识分子，“权威”、“专家”，极力向同学们灌输“邮电主要是为城市服务，农村不需要”，“面向农村是对的，大学生到农村有什么用？”这实质是培养什么样的邮电事业接班人的问题，是邮电事业为谁服务的问题。毛主席教导我们说：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”“我国有五亿多农业人口，农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大。”遵循毛主席的教导，我们决心面向基层，深入工农兵，派出一批教育革命调查组，深入农村、工厂、邮电部门，进行试点和调查，向工人和贫下中农请教，把立足点移向工农兵，和工农兵一起搞教育革命，埋葬修正主义教育制度。
    我们的调查探索试点小分队，活跃在工厂和农村人民公社，向革命的工人、贫下中农虚心请教。他们沿途调查访问，并且为话务员、广播员组织短期训练班，互相学习，交流经验。贫下中农非常欢迎，叫他们“北京来的红电工”。
    通过调查试点，使我们深刻地认识到，要使教育为工农兵服务，必须彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。我们坚决依靠全院广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，大破大立，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，建立一个崭新的闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级教育制度，沿着毛主席指引的无产阶级教育革命的航道，勇往直前！
