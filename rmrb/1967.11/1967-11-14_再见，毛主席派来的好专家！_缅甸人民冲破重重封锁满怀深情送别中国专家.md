The news that the Ne Win reactionary government of Burma had decided to expel Chinese experts sparked immense indignation among the Burmese people. In the residential areas around the Chinese-aided projects in Burma, people spread the word with hearts heavy with parting: "The comrades sent by Chairman Mao are leaving!" Countless hearts flew towards the Chinese experts' dormitories, and countless sharp gazes stared angrily at the reactionary military police tightly surrounding the Chinese experts.

Under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, the Ne Win reactionary government went crazy with anti-China frenzy. It added barbed wire fences around the Chinese experts' dormitories at various project sites, built watchtowers, and deployed large numbers of military police and special agents to patrol day and night as if facing a major enemy.

At the Swar rubber plywood factory, more than 20 Chinese experts were crammed into a row of four small wooden houses. The Ne Win reactionary government dispatched over 50 military police to monitor them. Four watchtowers were built at the corners of the wooden houses, and several more watchtowers were constructed in the distance, all connected by barbed wire. The reactionary army even set up a military radio station to report the situation of the experts' residence to Rangoon every day. Whenever the Chinese experts went out, they were escorted by at least four military police, sometimes even with guns pointed at them. The Chinese experts' dormitory at the Patheing textile factory was also surrounded by three layers of security: disguised special agents closely monitored the experts; fully armed soldiers stood guard in newly built watchtowers; and there were many plainclothes special agents outside preventing local residents from approaching the experts.

The Burmese workers who had long worked side by side with the Chinese experts were extremely angry at the fascist actions of the Ne Win reactionary government. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep friendship for the Chinese people, they braved the persecution of the reactionary military police and flocked to the doors of the Chinese experts' residences, demanding to go in and say their goodbyes. The reactionary military police blocked them with bayonets, so they found various ways to meet the Chinese experts. Some took advantage of delivering water or firewood to go in; others used the pretext of repairing lights to enter; some slipped through the barbed wire at night to see the experts. There were also workers who could not get in and had to ask others to convey their messages.

The Burmese workers had so much to say to their Chinese brothers! Those who entered the experts' dormitory immediately bowed respectfully to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall. Then they tightly grasped the experts' hands, tears streaming down their faces. They said, "We know very well what Ne Win's expulsion of you is all about. The deeds of the Ne Win clique are not the wish of the Burmese people!" "I have worked under the 'experts' from Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and all I got was beatings and scoldings. Where can you find such good experts like you? You are sent by Chairman Mao, you are our brothers!" "A Soviet 'expert' slapped me in the face, and I will remember the crimes of the Soviet revisionists for life. The photo of me with you, I will keep it for generations!" "When you reach Beijing, please convey my greetings to Chairman Mao! He is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the Burmese people!" They shouted over and over again in Chinese, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

There was also a young Burmese worker who tried three times to enter the heavily guarded Chinese experts' residential area. The first time, he pretended to be taking a walk and reached the barbed wire fence but could not get in. The next day after work, he borrowed a cow from a nearby village and took it to graze around the Chinese experts' residential area, looking for a chance to get in, but he failed again. The third time, he hitched a ride on a truck going to the Chinese experts' residential area to deliver goods and finally got in. He told the farmer driving the truck, "Drive slowly, let me talk to the Chinese experts for just one more minute!" Seeing the Chinese experts, he was so excited! He had so much to say but didn't know where to start, only raising his hands and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" Then he hugged the experts warmly. He also took a portrait of Chairman Mao and had a photo taken with the experts. He left the Chinese experts reluctantly, instructing them to remember to greet Chairman Mao when they return to their country and wish him eternal life.

The Burmese workers loved the Chinese experts not only because they learned various production techniques from them but more importantly, they felt the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought from these experts and saw the spirit of the Chinese people under Chairman Mao's guidance. A Burmese worker at the Snow Paper Factory said well: "I have read Chairman Mao's 'In Memory of Norman Bethune.' Now, from your actions, I further understand the meaning of this brilliant work. Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly worth learning from."

The day the Chinese experts were forced to leave finally came. These red internationalists cleaned their rooms thoroughly, tidied their beds neatly, and handed them over to the Burmese side. Then, they faced the guns of the Burmese reactionary military police, repeatedly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations such as "All reactionaries are paper tigers..." and singing revolutionary songs, walking proudly to the train station. Even a Burmese official receiving the house said, "Only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have such courage."

Along the way from the project site to the train station, the Ne Win reactionary government imposed martial law, with military police lining both sides. The car carrying the Chinese experts was also escorted by armed military vehicles in front and behind. All large and small train stations along the route were under martial law. The Ne Win government was still not satisfied and specially dispatched two cars full of armed soldiers to follow the experts' train along the public road next to the railway, fearing that the Burmese people might see their Chinese brothers one more time.

However, the Burmese people who cherish the Sino-Burmese friendship braved the risk of unemployment and persecution, finding various ways to see the experts off. Many people, despite the military police's obstruction, stood outside the cordon, on the hills, in the fields, on the sky bridges of the train stations, and in the vegetable markets next to the railway, waving farewell with tears in their eyes. Some brought their entire families, walking tens of miles away, waiting at the places where the special train was supposed to pass, just to see the experts one last time. At the Patheing textile factory, the car carrying the Chinese experts had traveled more than 20 miles when suddenly more than 20 workers rushed out from the side of the road, breaking through the military police's blockade, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" to see the Chinese experts off. A Burmese worker at the Swar rubber plywood factory knew that the train station was heavily guarded, so he hid in a train running parallel to the experts' special train in advance. After the experts boarded the train, he stuck his head out and waved enthusiastically to say goodbye. Another worker, because of the obstruction by the Burmese reactionary military police, could not see the Chinese experts off. Later, he walked hundreds of miles to Yangon to the Chinese Embassy to say goodbye to the Chinese experts. He asked the experts to tell the beloved Chairman Mao when they reach Beijing: "The Burmese people miss you very much! They miss the good experts you taught!"

The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Burmese peoples has been further consolidated and developed through the test of the anti-China reverse current stirred up by the Ne Win reactionary regime. The mad anti-China actions of the Burmese reactionaries can only backfire. As many Burmese workers told the Chinese experts, "The days of the Ne Win government will not last long, and you will definitely come back!"

### 再见，毛主席派来的好专家！——缅甸人民冲破重重封锁满怀深情送别中国专家

    再见，毛主席派来的好专家！
    ——缅甸人民冲破重重封锁满怀深情送别中国专家
    缅甸奈温反动政府背信弃义地决定驱逐中国专家的消息传出以后，激起了缅甸人民的无比愤慨。在中国援缅工程工地周围的居民点里，人们怀着惜别的心情奔走相告：“毛主席派来的亲人要走了！”于是，无数颗火热的心飞向中国专家宿舍，无数锋利的目光怒视着紧密包围中国专家的反动军警。
    奈温反动政府在美帝苏修的指使下，疯狂反华以后，就在各援缅工程工地的中国专家宿舍周围加设了铁丝网，修建了岗楼，大批军警特务如临大敌一般昼夜巡逻。
    在斯瓦胶合板厂，二十多名中国专家挤住在一排四间小木房里。奈温反动政府派了五十多名军警进行监视。木房周围的四角修起了四座地堡，远处又建了几座岗楼，各岗楼之间用铁丝网连接起来。反动军队还专门架设了军用电台，每天向仰光报告我专家住地情况。我专家外出，每次都有军警四人以上押送，有时甚至用枪口对着中国专家。密铁拉纺织厂的中国专家宿舍也有三层包围圈：装扮成各种勤杂人员的特务对专家严密监视；全副武装的军队在新建的岗楼上放哨；在外围还有许多便衣特务阻止当地居民同专家接近。
    同中国专家长期并肩劳动的缅甸工人，对奈温反动政府的这种法西斯行径感到极大的愤怒，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱和对中国人民的深厚友谊，不顾反动军警的迫害，纷纷涌到中国专家住宅的门口，要求进去同毛主席派来的亲人话别。反动军警的刺刀挡住了他们，他们就想尽各种办法，同中国专家会面。有的是利用送水、送柴的机会进去的；有的是用修理电灯的名义进去的；有的在黑夜里，穿过铁丝网，去见专家。还有一些实在进不去的工人，就托别人向专家捎句话。
    缅甸工人要向他们的中国兄弟说的话真是千言万语也说不完！进了专家宿舍的工人，一看到墙上的毛主席像，马上恭恭敬敬地行礼。然后紧紧握住专家的手，激动得泪流满面。他们说：“我们很清楚奈温驱逐你们是怎么一回事。奈温一伙干下的勾当，绝不是我们缅甸人民的心愿！”“我曾经在日本、英国、苏联
  ‘专家’手下干过活，不是挨打就挨骂；哪里有你们这样的好专家呀！你们是毛主席派来的人，是我们的亲兄弟！”“苏联‘专家’打了我一个耳光，我要把苏修的罪行记一辈子；你们和我合照的像片，我要留存几辈子！”“你们到了北京，代我向毛主席问好！他不仅是中国人民的领袖，也是我们缅甸人民的领袖！”他们一遍又一遍地用中国话喊：“中缅人民友好万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    还有一位缅甸青年工人曾经先后三次想方设法要进入被重重包围的中国专家居住区。第一次，他装作散步，走到铁丝网外，但是进不去。第二天下班后，他到附近村上借了一头牛，牵到中国专家居住区周围放牧，找机会进去，又没有成功。第三次，他搭上一辆到中国专家居住区拉东西的大车，终于进了中国专家宿舍。他向赶大车的农民说：“装车要慢些，让我同中国专家多谈一分钟也好！”见到了中国专家，他是多么地激动啊！他有千言万语要对专家讲，但又不知从哪里谈起，只是举起双手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”随后同专家热烈拥抱。他还拿起一张毛主席画像，和专家一起拍了照。他依依不舍地离开了中国专家，嘱咐专家回国后千万不要忘记向毛主席问好，祝他老人家万寿无疆。
    缅甸工人这样热爱中国专家，不仅仅因为他们从专家那里学会各种生产技术，更重要的，是从这些专家身上，体会到光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大，看到在毛主席教导下成长的中国人民的精神面貌。雪当纸厂的一位缅甸工人说得好：“我读过毛主席的《为人民服务》。现在，从你们的行动中我进一步懂得了这篇光辉著作的意义。世界上只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才最值得学习。”
    中国专家被迫离开的日子终于来到了。这些红色援外战士们，把房间打扫得干干净净，床铺收拾得整整齐齐，移交给缅方。然后，他们横眉冷对缅甸反动军警的刀枪，不断朗诵“一切反动派都是纸老虎。……”等毛主席语录，高唱革命歌曲，昂首阔步，前往火车站。连一个缅方接收房子的人员也感动地说：“只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才有这样的气魄。”
    在中国专家离工地去火车站的一路上，奈温反动政府都实行戒严，两旁军警密布。中国专家所坐的汽车，也由武装军警的车辆前后押送。专车途经的大小火车站，一律戒严。奈温政府还不放心，特地加派两辆汽车，满载武装士兵，在铁道旁的公路上，死跟着专家乘坐的火车走，生怕缅甸人民同他们这些中国兄弟多见一次面。
    但是，无限珍惜中缅友谊的缅甸人民，冒着失业和受迫害的危险，想出各种办法为专家送行。许多人不顾军警的阻拦，站在警戒线外边，在小山上，在田野里，在火车站的天桥上，在铁道旁的菜市场中，含着热泪向专家挥手告别。有的人带着全家老小，走出十几里外，在专车预定要经过的地方等候，以便再见专家一面。在密铁拉纺织厂，中国专家的汽车开出了二十多里，突然有二十几个工人从路旁跑出来，冲破军警的封锁，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”为中国专家送行。斯瓦胶合板厂的一个缅甸工人，知道火车站上戒备森严，就事先躲在同中国专家的专车并排的一列火车里，专家上车以后，他就探出身子，起劲地挥手告别。另一位工人，因为缅甸反动军警的阻拦，没有能给中国专家送行。事后，他走了几百里，赶到仰光中国大使馆，向中国专家告别。他请专家到北京时告诉敬爱的毛主席：“缅甸人民非常想念您！非常想念您教导的好专家！”
    中国人民和缅甸人民之间的战斗情谊，经过奈温反动政权掀起的反华逆流的考验，是更加巩固和发展了。缅甸反动派的疯狂反华，只能搬起石头打自己的脚。正象许多缅甸工人向中国专家所说的：“奈温政府的日子不会很长了，你们一定还会回来的！”
