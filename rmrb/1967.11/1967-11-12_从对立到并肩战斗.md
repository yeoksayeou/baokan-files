Revolutionary cadres must achieve new merits in the Cultural Revolution

Minutes of a discussion by some revolutionary cadres in Shanghai who participated in the "three-in-one combination"

Editors' note from *People's Daily* and *Wenhui Daily*: The following are excerpts from speeches made by some cadres at a joint meeting of revolutionary leading cadres organized by reporters from our two newspapers in Shanghai.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Old cadres have made contributions in the past, but they cannot rely on past merits. They must temper and reform themselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieve new merits and new achievements."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolutionary furnace of communism. It has educated and tempered our cadres and saved some who have made mistakes.

The facts prove that the vast majority of our cadres are good and are willing to fight side by side with the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards. Some have made mistakes in their work, but as long as they correct them, they can continue to achieve new merits for the Party and the people.

The comrades who participated in the discussion deeply felt from their personal experiences that they must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fight against selfishness and revisionism, replace the "self" with "public," replace "fear" with "dare," and replace "believing in oneself" with "believing in the masses." They must go to the masses and to the forefront of class struggle, and together with the broad masses, grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness for war, and dare to take on heavy responsibilities for the revolution.

From Opposition to Fighting Side by Side

Zhang Jingbiao, Head of the Yangpu District Revolutionary Committee, former Secretary of the Yangpu District Committee

I used to serve as the Secretary of the Yangpu District Committee. During my tenure of over a decade, I made many mistakes. In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, I faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line. When the revolutionary masses rose up to criticize and struggle against me, I was in opposition to them for a long time. I thought that as the responsible person of the district committee, I was following the Shanghai Municipal Committee, which was a matter of subordinates obeying superiors, and it was legitimate. During the struggle sessions, I thought to myself, "The country was won by us, and you cannot overthrow me." The Red Guards did ideological work on me, advising me not to "rely on past merits." I thought to myself, "You have not even earned any merits to rely on." The revolutionary faction said, "You should believe in the majority of the masses." I thought to myself, "You should believe in the majority of the cadres." In this way, I harbored serious opposition to the revolutionary faction and the revolutionary masses.

How did I change?

On one hand, the broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai exposed, criticized, and struggled against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, uncovering the lid of class struggle in the old Shanghai Municipal Committee. The shocking struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads made me wake up. I realized that at this critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, I had completely taken the wrong side. Through the criticism and struggle of the revolutionary masses, I deeply felt the seriousness of my mistakes, truly feeling guilty. I began to understand: opposing the masses is opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

On the other hand, the broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guard organizations conducted a special criticism, exposing and criticizing my series of mistakes over the seventeen years since liberation. To expose and criticize thoroughly, they organized special investigation groups and conducted in-depth investigations and research on me. They even investigated my family history before I was born. They found my old superiors and old comrades-in-arms. I had been the district committee secretary for eleven years, and they reviewed the records of the 539 district committee standing committee meetings I presided over. It was on the basis of mastering a large amount of material that they conducted their special criticism of me, each time deeper and more hitting the mark. At that time, my spiritual pressure was heavy, but my emotions gradually changed. In the past, I always thought that the revolutionary faction was enthusiastic but lacked depth. Now, seeing them do such thorough and detailed investigation work, mastering so much material, and their criticism of me being so reasonable, I admired them from the bottom of my heart, was grateful to them, and deeply felt happy for our Party and country to have such a large number of successors who have grown up in the great winds and waves of class struggle.

Later, the revolutionary faction helped me study Chairman Mao's works and helped me with self-reflection and comparison. Chairman Mao had already sounded the alarm for us at the Seventh Plenum of the Second Central Committee: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist." I did not heed Chairman Mao's words. In the peaceful life after liberation, I abandoned class struggle in my mind and unknowingly underwent a "peaceful evolution." I went from seriously alienating myself from the masses, fearing the masses' revolution, to the point of suppressing my own class brothers, becoming a accomplice of the bourgeois reactionary line. I betrayed the Party's long-term cultivation of me, forgot my miserable childhood, and forgot my comrades who shed blood and sacrificed their lives. Thinking of this, I extremely hated the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev that poisoned me. I must thoroughly break with the bourgeois reactionary line.

At the meeting for the great unity of the revolutionary faction in the district-level organs, when the revolutionary faction announced my release and invited me to participate in the work of the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, I was so moved that I shed tears. I said, "In the future, even if I am crushed to pieces, I will carry the revolution through to the end!"

Through this struggle, my feelings with the revolutionary faction have deepened. After I participated in the work of the Revolutionary Committee, they supported and helped me even more enthusiastically.

From my serious opposition to the proletarian revolutionary faction to fighting side by side with them today, I have undergone a transformation in my stance. In the future, I will read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will always maintain the character of the working class, always be an ordinary laborer, humbly learn from the revolutionary masses, and together with all the revolutionary masses in the district, strive to build the Yangpu District, which has a tradition of proletarian revolution, into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 从对立到并肩战斗

    革命干部要在文化大革命中立新功
    上海参加“三结合”的部分革命干部座谈会纪要
    《人民日报》、《文汇报》编者按：这里发表的，是我们两个报社的记者在上海联合召开的革命领导干部座谈会上一部分干部的发言。
    毛主席教导我们：“老干部过去有功劳，但是不能靠吃老本，要很好地在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼改造自己，要立新功，立新劳。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一个共产主义的革命熔炉。它教育和锻炼了我们的干部，也挽救了一些犯了错误的干部。
    事实证明，我们绝大多数干部是好的，是愿意同无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将并肩战斗的。有些人在工作中犯了错误，只要改了就好，就能够继续为党和人民立新功。
    参加座谈会的同志从切身体会中深深感到，一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，要斗私，批修，把“私”字换成“公”字，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”，到群众中去，到阶级斗争最尖锐的地方去，同广大群众一起抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，敢为革命挑重担。
    从对立到并肩战斗
    上海市杨浦区革命委员会负责人原杨浦区委书记  张敬标
    我原来担任杨浦区区委书记，在区委工作十几年中犯过许多错误，文化大革命运动初期，又忠实地执行了资产阶级反动路线。当革命群众起来批判、斗争我时，我很长时间和群众对立。我认为自己是区委负责人，保旧上海市委，是下级服从上级，名正言顺。在批判斗争会上，我心里就想：“天下是我们打的，你们打不倒我。”红卫兵小将做我的思想工作，劝我不要“吃老本”。我心里想：“你们还没有老本可吃。”革命派说：“你要相信群众的大多数。”我心里想：“你们要相信干部的大多数。”就这样，我同革命派和革命群众抱着严重对立情绪。
    我是怎样转变过来的呢？
    一方面，上海市广大革命群众对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在上海的代理人的大揭发、大批判和大斗争，揭开了旧上海市委阶级斗争的盖子。惊心动魄的两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的斗争，使我清醒过来。我认识到在两条路线斗争的关键时刻，我完全站错了队。经过革命群众的批判、斗争，我才深感自己的错误性质严重，真是罪恶深重。我开始明白：我反对了群众，就是反对了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    另一方面，是广大革命群众和红卫兵组织专题批判，揭发批判了我在解放十七年来的一系列错误。为了揭深批透，他们组织了专案小组，对我进行了深入的调查研究。连我出生前十年的家庭历史也调查到了。他们找遍了我的老上级、老战友。我当了十一年的区委书记，他们翻阅了我主持的五百三十九次区委常委会议记录。正是在掌握大量材料的基础上，他们对我的专题批判，一次比一次深入，一次比一次击中我的要害。当时，我的精神压力很重，但是感情上却逐渐有了转变。过去，我总觉得革命派热情高，水平不高。现在，看到他们做了那样深入细致的调查工作，掌握了那么多材料，而对我的批判又是那样合情合理，我从心里佩服他们，感激他们，而且深深为我们党和国家有了这样一大批在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长起来的接班人而感到无比高兴。
    后来革命派帮助我学习毛主席著作，帮助我进行回忆对比。毛主席早在党的七届二中全会上，就对我们敲了警钟：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”。我没有很好地听毛主席的话。在解放后的和平生活里，我头脑中放弃了阶级斗争，不知不觉地在“和平演变”着。我由严重地脱离群众，害怕群众起来革命，最后走到镇压自己阶级兄弟的地步，当了资产阶级反动路线的帮凶。我辜负了党对我多年的培养，忘记了自己苦难的童年，忘记了流血牺牲的战友。想到这里，我极端痛恨毒害我的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。我一定要和资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂。
    在区级机关革命派大联合的会上，当革命派宣布解放我并吸收我参加革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构工作时，我激动得掉下泪来。我说：“今后即使粉身碎骨，也要把革命干到底！”
    经过这场斗争，我和革命派之间的感情更深了。在我参加革命委员会工作以后，他们更加热情地支持我、帮助我。
    从我和无产阶级革命派的面对面的严重对立，到今天和他们心连心的并肩战斗，我经历了一个立场的转变过程。今后，我要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。我要永远保持工人阶级的本色，永远当一名普通劳动者，虚心向革命群众学习，和全区革命群众一起，努力把富有无产阶级革命传统的杨浦区建设成毛泽东思想的大学校。
