Once, Chinese students studying in Albania, who were about to return home to participate in the Cultural Revolution, decided to embroider a banner. They would embroider their love for the great leader onto the banner and present it to Chairman Mao. They selected nine classmates to go to the "Migjani" handicraft cooperative in Tirana to buy silk and velvet for making the banner. A female worker named Noti at the cooperative heard that the banner was to be presented to Mao Zedong and volunteered to come to the Chinese students' dormitory on her day off to help embroider the banner. She said: "The banner embroidered by the Chinese students expresses their love for Comrade Mao Zedong. I can embroider a few stitches on this banner and feel very happy. This also represents my support for the great Chinese people's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong."

She also said, "Not only do we Albanian people, but all true Marxist-Leninists around the world draw inspiration from the thoughts of Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the theory of scientific communism."

Another Albanian student also enthusiastically came to help embroider the banner. The banner read: "Dear Chairman Mao, wishing you eternal life!" When this Albanian student learned that he was embroidering the lower half of the character "您" (you), which is the character "心" (heart), he happily said: "I am embroidering the character '心' (heart), which represents my love for Chairman Mao."

    锦旗献给毛主席
    有一次，即将回国参加文化大革命的中国留阿尔巴尼亚学生决定绣一面锦旗，把自己对伟大领袖的热爱心情绣在锦旗上，敬献给毛主席。他们推选了九个同学到地拉那“米吉安尼”手工业合作社去买做锦旗的绸缎和丝绒。这个合作社的女工诺蒂听说要给毛主席献锦旗，就乘星期日休息时，自动来到中国同学的宿舍里帮助绣锦旗。她说：中国同学绣的锦旗，表现了他们对毛泽东同志的热爱。我能在这面旗帜上也绣上两、三针，感到十分幸福，这也表示我对伟大的中国人民在杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志领导下进行的无产阶级文化大革命的支持。她还说：“不仅我们阿尔巴尼亚人民，而且全世界一切真正的马克思列宁主义者都从毛泽东主席的思想中得到教益。毛泽东思想是科学共产主义的理论。”另一位阿尔巴尼亚同学也热情地前来帮助绣锦旗。锦旗上写着：“敬爱的毛主席，祝您万寿无疆！”当这位阿尔巴尼亚同学知道他绣的正是“您”字下半边的“心”字时，高兴地说：“我绣的是‘心’字，正代表我热爱毛主席的心意。”
