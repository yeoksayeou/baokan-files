	Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 13: Under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, and under the great call to arms of Chairman Mao to "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism," the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou has been established.

	On the morning of the 9th, ten million revolutionary workers, peasants from the suburbs, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou from the army, navy, and air force gathered at the Yuexiu Mountain Stadium to hold a grand celebration meeting. Responsible comrades from the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, including Kong Shiquan, Yan Fusheng, and Chen De, attended the meeting.

	The venue was filled with red flags and the sound of drums. The revolutionary masses were in high spirits, holding colorful portraits of Chairman Mao and red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and surging into the venue from all directions. Many revolutionary workers' teams, after entering the venue, read aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao in unison, expressing their boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao.

	The meeting began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." When the host announced the formal establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou, the entire venue was filled with the sound of firecrackers and thunderous applause. The people cheered again and again: "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

	The Central Cultural Revolution Group and the State Council sent a telegram of congratulations to the meeting. When the host read this telegram to the meeting, the revolutionary masses in the entire venue shouted again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

	The working class of Guangzhou, in the more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, raised high the banner of revolutionary rebellion is justified, broken through the heavy suppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, and with great revolutionary spirit, launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, bravely defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the dictatorship of the proletariat. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" and the latest instructions that "within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions," the three major revolutionary mass organizations of workers in Guangzhou conducted repeated studies and serious discussions. They deeply felt the great responsibility of the working class in the cultural revolution and recognized the importance of the great unity of the working class. Under these circumstances, after thorough preparation and democratic consultation, the three organizations finally united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and established the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou.

	The host said in his speech: The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou shows the invincible power of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and is another resounding victory song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou is also inseparable from the great support and help of the great People's Liberation Army of China. He hoped that the working class of Guangzhou would continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity in their minds, promote the great unity of other fronts, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically. They must resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, believe in and rely on the majority of cadres, help revolutionary cadres stand up, and realize the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." He also hoped that the working class of Guangzhou would be the pioneers of the revolution and the models of production, while also greatly enhancing their revolutionary vigilance and resolutely smashing all sabotage activities of the class enemies at home and abroad.

	Comrade Kong Shiquan, a responsible comrade of the Guangzhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting, representing all the soldiers and officers of the Guangzhou Military Region to extend their warmest congratulations to the working class of Guangzhou. He highly praised the working class of Guangzhou, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, for listening to Chairman Mao's words the most and setting an example for the great unity of the revolution in the Guangzhou region, making new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Guangzhou region. Kong Shiquan hoped that the working class of Guangzhou would better use Mao Zedong Thought to unify their thoughts and actions, take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key, and hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes to strengthen the ideological construction of the revolutionary ranks. He said, we must firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and turn every factory and enterprise into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	Comrade Chen De, a responsible comrade of the Guangdong Provincial Military Region, also spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he expressed his belief that after the working class of Guangzhou unites, they will definitely be able to further promote the great unity of the entire revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Guangzhou region with their model actions. He also expressed his belief that the working class of Guangzhou, after achieving revolutionary great unity, will definitely be able to better carry out the great policy of "Grasp the Revolution and Promote Production" of the great leader Chairman Mao, better unite against the enemy, jointly criticize revisionism, and thoroughly criticize and repudiate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, and other representatives attending the meeting pointed out in their speeches that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The whole history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will win." This is an unshakable great truth. They said, the working class unites, can better resist the impact of petty-bourgeois factionalism, better unite all revolutionary forces, promote the great unity of all fronts, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and more powerfully promote the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory.

	The meeting, amid warm applause, passed a telegram of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao and passed the declaration of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of the Revolutionary Working Class in Guangzhou. The meeting ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," followed by a grand demonstration march. (Photo attached)
