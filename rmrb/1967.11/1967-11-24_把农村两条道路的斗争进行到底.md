The publication of the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside" is a new mobilization order issued by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev, and a powerful ideological weapon to promote the victory of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside. This article systematically criticizes the heinous crimes committed by China's Khrushchev in the countryside, expressing the sentiments of us poor and lower-middle peasants. It is truly excellent! We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further ignite a new high tide of revolutionary criticism in the countryside, thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and carry the struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside to the end.

China's Khrushchev is the representative of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. He has always opposed the poor and lower-middle peasants in walking the socialist road, singing counterpoint to Chairman Mao. From land reform to the present, every step we take forward, he has driven a nail, harming us poor and lower-middle peasants. Take his advocacy of the "three horses, one plow, one cart" rich peasant economy, for example. He rambles on about how only when the "three horses, one plow, one cart" rich peasant economy develops to 70% of the households, can collective agriculture be achieved. How can the countryside possibly have 70% of households with "three horses, one plow, one cart"? Absolutely not! Just take our Fourth Production Brigade, for instance. There are 22 households with 1,020 mu of land. A household with "three horses, one plow, one cart" generally needs 300 mu of land to farm. This way, just three households can farm all the land in the village, and the rest would have to carry heavy loads and do odd jobs. Isn't China's Khrushchev clearly advocating exploitation and aiming to restore capitalism in the countryside? This is his evil scheme!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote more extensive and more violent revolutions." China's Khrushchev's harm to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants has aroused our boundless hatred. We are sworn enemies with him! In this Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have taken up our pens and voices to launch a great criticism, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev from head to toe. Now, in our Red Star Brigade, the black goods peddled by China's Khrushchev have become rats crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them.

In the past year of revolutionary criticism, we have severely criticized China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We have criticized "self-reliance, self-management, and self-sufficiency," "material incentives," and those who pursued small freedoms and competed for work points in the production brigades have disappeared. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of the commune members. As Comrade Lin Biao said: "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, becoming an invincible spiritual atomic bomb." The past year's revolutionary criticism has brought about earth-shaking changes in our brigade, with the situation being excellent. Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Every family cares about state affairs, and everyone fights against selfishness and criticizes revisionism. Everyone's heart is with Chairman Mao, and everyone's heart is with the Communist Party. The revolutionization of people's thoughts has brought about a bumper harvest in production. This year, our brigade's grain output is higher than any other year. Agricultural basic construction has developed unprecedentedly, electricity has been installed, and electric wells have been dug. The commune members say: "This is the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in our Red Star Brigade, and this is the victory of the Cultural Revolution."

Currently, we must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with "criticize selfishness and revisionism" as the guideline, further criticize China's Khrushchev, eliminate his poisonous influence, and uproot the roots of revisionism. We resolutely follow the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    把农村两条道路的斗争进行到底
    黑龙江省巴彦县永发公社红星大队老贫农　满清海
    《中国农村两条道路的斗争》一文的发表，是伟大领袖毛主席、党中央向咱们贫下中农下达的一道彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的新的动员令，是推动农村文化大革命胜利前进的强大思想武器。这篇文章系统地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村所犯的滔天罪行，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，真是好得很！我们坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在农村进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的流毒，把农村两条道路和两条路线的斗争进行到底。
    中国赫鲁晓夫是地主、资产阶级的总代表，他一贯和毛主席唱对台戏，反对贫下中农走社会主义道路。从土改到现在，我们在前进道路上每走一步，他都埋下一个钉子，坑害我们贫下中农。就拿他鼓吹的“三马一犁一车”的富农经济来说吧，他胡说什么只有“三马一犁一车”的富农经济发展到农户的百分之七十，才能搞农业集体化。农村怎么可能出百分之七十的“三马一犁一车”的农户呢？绝对不能！就说我们第四生产队，共有二十二户人家，一千零二十亩地。一个“三马一犁一车”的农户，一般的要有三百亩土地才够种。这样，只要三户就可以把全村土地包种了，其余的人都得去扛大活、打短工。中国赫鲁晓夫这不明明是提倡剥削，是要在农村复辟资本主义吗！这是他的一条毒计！
    毛主席教导我们说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”中国赫鲁晓夫对广大贫下中农的毒害激起了我们无比的仇恨，我们和他誓不两立！在这次毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们广大贫下中农动笔动口，开展大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫从头到尾批得稀臭。现在，在我们红星大队，中国赫鲁晓夫叫卖的那一套黑货，已经成了过街的老鼠，人人喊打。
    一年来的革命大批判中，我们狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，大树特树了毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们批判了“三自一包”、“物质刺激”，在生产队里过去搞小自由的人、争工分的人没有了。毛泽东思想照亮了社员的心。正象林副主席说的：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”一年来的革命大批判，使我们大队发生了翻天覆地的变化，形势一片大好。毛泽东思想照亮了我们贫下中农的心，家家关心国家大事，人人斗私批修。人人心向毛主席，个个心向共产党。人的思想革命化，带来了生产的大丰收，今年我们大队的粮食产量比以往任何一年都高。农田基本建设空前大发展，办起了电，打了电井。社员们说：“这是毛主席的革命路线在我们红星大队的胜利，这是文化大革命的胜利。”
    当前，我们要更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫，肃清他的流毒，挖掉修正主义的根子。我们坚决走毛主席指引的社会主义道路，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
