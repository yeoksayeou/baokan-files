The notorious Central Intelligence Agency of the United States is the mastermind behind the fascist military regime of Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia, orchestrating their maddened anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China crimes. It is the black hand that reaches into every corner of Indonesian society to plot conspiracies.

The CIA's tentacles extend into Indonesia's political, military, economic, educational, and party and mass organizations. The U.S. Embassy in Indonesia serves as the CIA's main lair for its conspiratorial activities.

The U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Green, is a major CIA operative. He previously served as the head of a special group in the U.S. State Department responsible for researching policy towards China, earning him the title of a so-called "China expert." During his tenure as the U.S. Consul General in Hong Kong and Counselor at the "U.S. Embassy" in South Korea, he committed numerous atrocities. The riots orchestrated by Chiang Kai-shek's agents in Kowloon in 1965 and the farce of replacing the puppet Lee Sung-man in South Korea were both carried out under his direct involvement and direction. This anti-communist, anti-China veteran took up his post in Indonesia just before the Suharto-Nasution fascist military coup in 1965.

Another major CIA operative in Indonesia is Bill Palmer, the former head of the "American Film Association" in Indonesia. This old spy infiltrated Indonesia in 1950 under the guise of an employee of the "American Asia Foundation." He then continued his conspiratorial activities as the distributor of American yellow films in Indonesia. According to Indonesian newspapers, the U.S. Ambassador consults with him on "major policies" for Indonesia. The revolutionary people of Indonesia expelled him in 1965 and seized CIA black documents from his home.

The U.S. Information Service is another important base for the CIA's conspiratorial and sabotage activities in Indonesia. It was forced to close in 1965 due to strong opposition from the Indonesian people. The CIA also conducts cultural infiltration and political bribery in Indonesia through the "Ford Foundation."

As the fascist military regime in Indonesia intensifies its anti-communist and anti-China campaigns, the CIA's collusion with this regime becomes even more intimate.

Currently, a large number of Americans are flooding into Indonesia under various identities. The "Indonesia Grand Hotel" in Jakarta is filled with American "guests." The notorious CIA spy Palmer, who was previously expelled by the Indonesian people, has returned to Indonesia. U.S. Ambassador Green recently personally visited places like Padang and Makassar to conspire with local right-wing leaders.

At the same time, some suspicious American figures have secretly arrived in Indonesia. John D. Rockefeller III, who claims to be "neither a politician nor a businessman," visited his "old friend" Suharto and Malik in Indonesia this September. This Rockefeller is the head of the "Rockefeller Foundation," which has close ties with the CIA.

For a long time, the CIA has been colluding with and cultivating pro-American forces in Indonesia, committing heinous crimes. Every counter-revolutionary armed rebellion in Indonesia has been orchestrated by the CIA. In 1956, during the local armed rebellion in Indonesia, the CIA's top spy Allen Dulles personally directed the operations. In 1958, the CIA-employed American pilot Allen Pope assisted the rebels in bombing Indonesian territory. In September 1965, the CIA directly orchestrated the counter-revolutionary military coup led by the right-wing "Command Council" of Suharto and Nasution. In February of last year, the CIA also participated in Suharto's further seizure of power. According to foreign news agencies, at that time, personnel from U.S. institutions in Indonesia frequently "visited" the leaders of the yellow unions, reactionary parties, and right-wing student organizations such as the "Indonesian Student Action Union."

The U.S. imperialists, through their CIA, have committed countless atrocities against the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people will one day settle this blood debt with U.S. imperialism.

    伸黑手　耍阴谋　煽妖风　搞侵略
    美国中央情报局是印尼反动派的幕后操纵者
    据新华社讯　臭名昭著的美国中央情报局，是印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权疯狂进行反共、反人民、反华罪恶勾当的幕后操纵者，是伸进印尼各个领域里进行阴谋活动的一只大黑手。
    美国中央情报局的魔爪伸入印尼政治、军事、经济、文教以及政党、群众团体等各个部门，而美国驻印尼大使馆就是美国中央情报局在印尼进行阴谋活动的大黑窝。
    美国驻印尼大使格林本人就是美国中央情报局的一个大特务。他曾任美国国务院研究对华政策的特别小组负责人，是一个所谓“中国通”。在他历任美国驻香港总领事和南朝鲜“大使馆”参赞期间，干尽了坏事。一九六五年蒋帮特务在九龙搞的暴乱事件和南朝鲜上演的更换走狗李承晚的丑剧，都是在他直接参与和导演下进行的。这个反共、反华老手，正是在一九六五年苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团进行反革命军事政变前不久到印尼走马上任的。
    美国中央情报局在印尼的另一个大特务是前印尼“美国电影协会”的头子比尔·帕默尔。这个老特务，早在一九五○年，以美国“亚洲基金会”职员的身份潜入印尼。随后又以美国黄色电影在印尼发行人的身份进行阴谋活动。据印尼报纸透露，美国大使决定对印尼的“重大政策”时，都要跟他“磋商”。印尼革命人民一九六五年赶走了他，并在他家里抄出美国中央情报局的黑文件。
    美国新闻处是美国中央情报局在印尼搞阴谋破坏活动的另一重要据点。一九六五年遭到印尼人民强烈反对，被迫封闭。美国中央情报局还通过“福特基金会”对印尼进行文化侵略和政治收买活动。
    随着印尼法西斯军人政权反共、反华日益加剧，美国中央情报局同这个法西斯军人政权的勾结也更加紧密。
    目前，大批美国人以各种不同身份涌进印尼。雅加达“印尼大旅馆”挤满了美国“住客”。曾被印尼人民赶走的臭名昭著的美国特务帕默尔已经重返印尼。美国大使格林最近还亲自到巴东、望加锡等地“访问”，同当地右派头目加紧勾结。
    与此同时，美国一些可疑人物也偷偷来到印尼。自称“不是政治家也不是商人”的美国石油垄断资本家约翰·戴维森·洛克菲勒第三今年九月到印尼“访问”了他的“老朋友”苏哈托、马利克。这个洛克菲勒就是同美国中央情报局有密切关系的“洛克菲勒基金会”的负责人。
    长期以来，美国中央情报局一直在印尼勾结、培植亲美势力，进行罪恶活动。印尼历次反革命武装叛乱都是由美国中央情报局一手策划的。一九五六年，印尼地方武装叛乱时，美国中央情报局的头号特务艾伦·杜勒斯曾亲自出马到印尼督阵。美国中央情报局雇用的美国飞行员阿伦·波普一九五八年还协助叛匪轰炸印尼国土。一九六五年九月，美国中央情报局又直接策划了以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的右派“将领委员会”发动的反革命军事政变。去年二月，美国中央情报局还参与了苏哈托进一步夺权的勾当。据外国通讯社透露，当时，美国驻印尼机构的人员“频繁”地“拜访”印尼的黄色工会、反动政党以及右派学生组织“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的头目。
    美帝国主义通过它的中央情报局对印尼人民犯下种种的滔天罪行，印尼人民终有一天要向美帝国主义算清这笔血债的。
