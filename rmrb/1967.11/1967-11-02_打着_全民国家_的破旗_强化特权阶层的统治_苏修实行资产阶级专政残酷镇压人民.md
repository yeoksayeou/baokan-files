The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, while frenziedly attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, has once again raised the tattered banner of the "people's state," claiming that there are no antagonistic classes in Soviet society and that the laboring people enjoy "broad possibilities for participating in the management of state, economic, and social affairs," and so on. This is a barefaced lie. In reality, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been strengthening the rule of the bourgeois privileged class and has been carrying out ruthless bourgeois dictatorship over the Soviet people.

	Mass Purges and the Elimination of Dissidents; Recruiting Traitors and Placing Trusted Followers
	After seizing power through a bourgeois coup d'état, Khrushchev and his gang carried out a large-scale purge of the original party and state leadership nationwide from top to bottom. They demoted those they did not trust and placed their own trusted followers in leadership positions. According to reports, nearly 70 percent of the Central Committee members elected at the 19th Congress of the CPSU in 1952 were purged by the time of the 22nd Congress in 1961. Even nearly 60 percent of the Central Committee members elected at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956 were purged by the time of the 23rd Congress in 1966. More were purged in the local party and state organizations. In last year's "election" of Supreme Soviet representatives, two-thirds of the people were elected for the first time. The Soviet revisionist leadership, under the pretext of promoting "experts" who can lead major undertakings, has stuffed various levels of party and state organs, economic, and cultural and educational departments with a large number of bourgeois elements and revisionists, constantly strengthening the rule of the privileged class.

	Strengthening the Repressive Apparatus and Brutally Suppressing People's Resistance
	The Soviet revisionist clique has strengthened the state apparatus under its control, including the army, police, prisons, and courts, to carry out bourgeois dictatorship over the Soviet people. In addition to carrying out purges within the army, they have been vigorously instilling revisionist ideology into the broad ranks of Soviet soldiers, making the revisionist general line the "guide to action for military cadres." The heads of the Soviet revisionist leadership in the military have arrogantly ordered their officers to "unconditionally execute" the policies of the Soviet revisionists and threatened that those who do not "enrich" themselves with Soviet revisionist theory "will eventually be removed from their posts" and "will be dismissed from their posts like throwing away a bundle." The Soviet revisionist leadership has mobilized the army to brutally suppress and massacre Soviet revolutionary masses who rose up to oppose revisionism and to suppress striking workers. It is revealed that in June of this year, there was an incident of suppressing a workers' demonstration in the city of Chimkent in Central Asia. The automobile workers in this city held a demonstration because the police had unreasonably beaten a driver to death, and they attacked and burned down the headquarters of the city police and a nearby police station. As a result, the authorities mobilized tanks and armored vehicles to suppress the demonstration, killing dozens of people, and many others were injured and arrested.

	The Soviet revisionists originally had a huge public security force and police, but they still felt they could not maintain "social order" due to the people's increasing awakening and continuous resistance. In July of last year, they established the "All-Union Republic Department of Public Order" and specially increased motorized police patrols in major cities in the Soviet Union. At the same time, local "people's patrols" were reorganized, and reliable people were sent to "strengthen" the leadership. The Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin admitted that the Soviet Union has "strengthened" the work of the courts and police stations in recent years, and the number of police has increased.

	To suppress and persecute the broad masses of the Soviet people who insist on Marxism-Leninism and dare to struggle and resist, the Soviet revisionists have spread plainclothes agents throughout the country and set up a large number of fascist-style concentration camps. This is already well-known in the Soviet Union. It is revealed that at the beginning of this year, the Soviet security organs carried out large-scale arrests in Western Ukraine and other places, and many people were sent to concentration camps.

	The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, in order to suppress the people's resistance, has threatened to "punish" those who spread "rumors and fabricated stories." At the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine, the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party openly declared that those who spread views that are "incompatible with the views of the Soviet revisionists" should be subjected to "social punishment." It is reported that the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic has formally passed the "punishment" law. At the beginning of this year, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic added new clauses to its criminal law, stipulating that those who "defame the Soviet political and social order" and "spread anti-Soviet rumors" should be sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In January, some Soviet youth held a march and demonstration to protest the addition of these clauses, but they were suppressed by the police, and two young people were sentenced to three years' imprisonment for "disrupting public order."

	"Millionaires" Act Arbitrarily; Workers Become Hired Slaves
	The Soviet working class's resistance and dissatisfaction with the Soviet revisionist leadership's comprehensive restoration of the capitalist "new economic system" has also made the Soviet revisionist clique tremble with fear. The Soviet revisionist clique passed the so-called "resolution on strengthening labor discipline" in December last year, emphasizing the need to fully utilize "administrative measures stipulated by law" and strengthen the role of the "Procuratorate of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union," revealing their ferocious intent to suppress the Soviet working class.

	Under the rule of the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique, members of the privileged class, using their power and control over the means of production, engage in embezzlement, speculation, and corruption, and ruthlessly oppress and exploit the broad masses of the Soviet people, with many becoming "millionaires." Those bourgeois elements disguised as "managers" and "factory directors" act arbitrarily and do as they please. Under the rule of these bourgeois elements, the Soviet working people have become hired slaves, deprived of all rights. As long as they express the slightest dissatisfaction with the "leaders," they will be subjected to various forms of punishment, dismissed, or even imprisoned.

	It is clear that today's Soviet Union is a place where there is a sharp class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is carrying out a naked bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist clique's claim that the Soviet Union under their rule is a "people's state" is a barefaced lie.

### 打着“全民国家”的破旗　强化特权阶层的统治  苏修实行资产阶级专政残酷镇压人民

    打着“全民国家”的破旗　强化特权阶层的统治
    苏修实行资产阶级专政残酷镇压人民
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团最近在疯狂攻击无产阶级专政的同时，再次打出“全民国家”的破旗，叫嚷什么苏联社会已经没有敌对阶级了，劳动人民享有“参加管理国家、经济和社会事务的广泛可能性”等等。这完全是无耻的谎言。实际上，苏修领导集团一直在强化资产阶级特权阶层的统治，对苏联人民实行残酷的资产阶级专政。
            大肆清洗排除异己  招降纳叛安插亲信
    赫鲁晓夫及其一伙通过资产阶级政变，篡夺苏联的党和国家政权之后，就在全国范围内自上而下对原党政领导机构进行了大规模的清洗，把他们所不信任的人打下去，把他们的亲信安插到领导岗位上。据报道，一九五二年苏共第十九次代表大会选出的中央委员，到一九六一年苏共二十二大时有近百分之七十被清洗。连一九五六年苏共第二十次代表大会选出的中央委员，到一九六六年苏共第二十三次代表大会时，也有近百分之六十被搞掉。地方各级党政组织中被清洗的更多。在去年进行的最高苏维埃代表“选举”中，有三分之二的人是第一次当选的。苏修领导集团还借口重用“有能力领导大事业”的“专家”，把大批资产阶级人物、修正主义分子塞进各级党政机构、经济和文化教育部门，不断加强特权阶层的统治。
            大力强化专政机器  残暴镇压人民反抗
    苏修集团大力强化他们所控制的军队、警察、监狱、法庭等国家机器，对苏联人民实行资产阶级专政。他们除了在军队中进行清洗外，并向广大苏联官兵大力灌输修正主义思想，把修正主义总路线定为“军事干部的行动指南”。苏修领导集团在军界的头目曾气势汹汹地命令他们的军官，要“无条件执行”苏修的政策，并威胁说，那些不以苏修理论“充实”自己的人“最后会下台”，会“象摔包袱一样解除他们的职务”。苏修领导集团曾调动军队残暴地镇压和屠杀起来反对修正主义的苏联革命群众，镇压罢工工人。据透露，今年六月苏联中亚细亚的奇姆肯特市就发生过一起镇压工人示威的事件。这个城市的汽车工人因警察无理打死汽车司机而举行了示威，工人袭击并焚毁了市民警总部和附近的一个派出所，结果当局调动坦克和装甲车进行镇压，打死数十人，还有许多人受伤和被捕。
    苏修本来已有庞大的公安部队和警察，但慑于人民的日益觉醒和不断反抗，仍感不能维持“社会治安”。在去年七月又成立了“联盟—共和国社会治安部”，并在苏联的各大城市专门增设了摩托化民警部队巡逻放哨。与此同时，各地还改组了“人民纠察队”，派了他们认为靠得住的人去“加强”领导。苏修头目柯西金供认，苏联近年来“加强”了法院和民警局的工作，“民警的人数增加了”。
    为了镇压和迫害坚持马克思列宁主义、敢于斗争和敢于反抗的苏联广大群众，苏修在全国各地密布便衣特务，设立了大批法西斯式的集中营。这在苏联已经是人所共知的事。据透露，今年年初，苏修保安机关就曾在西乌克兰等地进行了大逮捕，许多人被关进了集中营。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团为了压制人民的反抗，还扬言要对所谓散布“谣言和捏造的话”的人进行“制裁”。乌克兰共产党的头目在乌克兰共产党第二十三次代表大会上作总结报告时，公然叫嚷要对那些同苏修观点“格格不入的观点的传播者”“进行社会制裁”。据报道，现在俄罗斯联邦已正式通过了“制裁”的法律。今年年初俄罗斯联邦在刑法中增加了新条款，对所谓“诋毁苏联政治和社会秩序”、“散布反苏谣言的人”要判处三年的徒刑。今年一月有些苏联青年为了抗议增加这些条款而举行了游行示威，结果遭到警察镇压，有两名青年被以“破坏公共秩序”的罪名判刑三年。
          “百万富翁”飞扬跋扈  工人沦为雇佣奴隶
    苏联工人阶级对苏修领导集团全面复辟资本主义的“经济新体制”的抵制和不满，也使苏修集团胆战心惊。苏修集团在去年十二月通过所谓“加强劳动纪律的决议”，强调要充分利用“法律规定的行政措施”，加强“苏联检察机关和苏联最高法院”的作用，凶相毕露地对苏联工人阶级实行镇压。
    在勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团的统治下，特权阶层分子利用他们的权势和对生产资料的支配地位，贪污盗窃、投机倒把、营私舞弊，对广大的苏联人民实行残酷的压迫和剥削，许多人成了“百万富翁”。那些披着“经理”、“厂长”外衣的资产阶级分子，飞扬跋扈，为所欲为。苏联劳动群众在这些资产阶级分子的统治下沦为雇佣奴隶，被剥夺了一切权利。只要他们对“领导者”稍许表示一些不满，就要遭到各式各样的处分，被开除，甚至坐监牢。
                        ×　×　×
    十分明显，今天的苏联，存在着资产阶级同无产阶级之间尖锐的阶级斗争。苏修统治集团在苏联实行的是赤裸裸的资产阶级专政。苏修集团把他们统治下的苏联说成是什么“全民国家”，不过是一个弥天大谎。
