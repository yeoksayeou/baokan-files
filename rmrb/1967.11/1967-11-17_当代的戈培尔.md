During the Second World War, the Nazi propagandist Goebbels boasted about the invincibility of the German army. In no time, this clown became a laughing stock of the world. However, more than twenty years after the victory of the anti-fascist war, on the heroic soil of the Soviet Union that once defeated the German fascists, the Soviet revisionist writer Simonov is licking the spittle of Goebbels, shamelessly praising the strength of the German devils, and reweaving the myth of the invincibility of the German army.

In his counter-revolutionary novel *The Living and the Dead*, Simonov, under the banner of reflecting the Soviet Patriotic War, exaggerates the "glorious victories" of the German devils and the "step-by-step retreats" of the Soviet Red Army. He shamelessly proclaims: "The German devils are strong."

In Simonov's portrayal, the German devils are like gods of war. Look, he calls the German planes "steel bees." When the Red Army planes encounter these "steel bees," they either "plummet down in thick smoke" or "crash down like dry wood into a blazing fire," with no chance to retaliate. After these "steel bees" finish off the Red Army planes, they "happily" "maneuver in the air, exchanging positions," and play around.

In Simonov's depiction, the Soviet Red Army is like "sand grains" under the "wheels of German war." Some are so frightened that they "lose their minds," "trembling all over," while others, fearing capture, "bury their documents." As soon as the German army attacks, the Red Army's ranks fall into chaos, with subordinates "shooting their superiors," and comrades "killing each other." Communication is lost up, down, and all around, and planes that "haven't had time to take off" are "burned one by one on the ground." The Red Army is like "every blade of grass is a soldier," fleeing at the sight of the enemy. Before the enemy even arrives, the battlefield is already "desolate."

Writing the Red Army as cowards is to show the invincibility of the German army. On a day when Hitler has long since collapsed, Simonov still wants to resurrect the dead and play the old tune of Goebbels, truly more Goebbels than Goebbels.

Lies can never cover up the iron facts.

The German army, which rampaged across Western Europe and acted as if it were invincible, suffered heavy losses as soon as it entered Soviet territory. Even the German devils had to admit that the Soviet Red Army was "a formidable force." The great Soviet Patriotic War ultimately sentenced the German fascists to death, and the victorious red flag flew high above the Reichstag building in Berlin.

Yet, to this day, Simonov still stubbornly portrays a few buzzing flies of the German fascists as invincible "steel bees," and defames the great Soviet Red Army as "sand grains" under the "wheels of German war," boosting the morale of the German devils and undermining the spirit of the Soviet Red Army. He completely reverses the heroic history of the entire Soviet Patriotic War. This shameless Soviet revisionist writer, who worships the Hitler gang, already buried by the Soviet Red Army, and tramples on the dignity of his own nation and the honor of his country, is truly exposed!

Goebbels, in his time, boasted about the invincibility of the German army to serve Hitler's arrogant plan to dominate the world. Today, Simonov boasts about the might of the former German fascists to promote the strength of contemporary American imperialism. Today's Johnson is the Hitler of the 1960s. The Soviet revisionists, from Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin to the likes of Simonov, are all "Goebbels" of American imperialism!

    当代的戈培尔
    解放军某部五好战士　张宗荣
    第二次世界大战时期，德国法西斯的喇叭人物戈培尔，曾经大吹大擂德国军队不可战胜的神话。曾几何时，这位小丑就成了世界人民的一块笑料。可是，在反法西斯战争胜利了二十多年的今天，在当年打败德国法西斯的苏维埃英雄国土上，苏修文人西蒙诺夫竟然又舔起戈培尔的唾涎，无耻地赞颂德国鬼子的强大，重新编造了德国军队不可战胜的神话。
    西蒙诺夫在他的反革命小说《生者与死者》里，打着反映苏联卫国战争的旗号，大写德国鬼子的“辉煌胜利”，大写苏联红军的“节节败退”。他无耻地宣扬：“德国鬼子是强大的”。
    在西蒙诺夫笔下，德国鬼子就象神兵天将。你看，他把德国飞机称为“钢蜂”，红军的飞机遇到了这样的“钢蜂”，不是“冒着浓烟掉下去”，就是“象干柴凑着烈火一样”“栽下去”，没有一点还手之力。这些“钢蜂”们打完了红军的飞机之后，还“愉快地”“在空中彼此让开，互换位置”，戏耍一番。
    在西蒙诺夫笔下，苏联红军成了“德国战争车轮下的”“砂粒”。他们有的吓得“神经错乱”，“浑身颤栗”，有的怕当俘虏，“把证件埋藏起来”。德军一进攻，红军的队伍就乱作一团，下级“用手枪对着上级”，自己人“打死了自己人”，上下左右都失去了联系，飞机“没来得及上升”，就“在地上一架架焚毁”。红军简直是“草木皆兵”，望风而逃，敌人还没有到，阵地上已经“荒无人烟”。
    把红军写得象熊包，是为了显示德军的“不可战胜”。在希特勒早已彻底垮台的今天，西蒙诺夫还要这样借尸还魂，重弹戈培尔的老调，真是比戈培尔还要戈培尔。
    谎言终究掩盖不住铁的事实。
    在西欧战场上横冲直撞、不可一世的德国军队，进入苏联的国土后，就遭到了苏联红军的严重打击。连德国鬼子也不得不承认，苏联红军“是一种可怕的力量”。伟大的苏联卫国战争，最后宣判了德国法西斯的死刑，胜利的红旗高高飘扬在柏林帝国议会大厦的上空。
    可是，直到今天，西蒙诺夫还硬把德国法西斯几个嗡嗡叫的苍蝇说成是无敌的“钢蜂”，把伟大的苏联红军污蔑为“德国战争车轮下的”“砂粒”，长德国鬼子的威风，灭苏联红军的志气，把整个苏联卫国战争的英雄历史，来了个大颠倒。这个无耻的苏修文人，竟对早已被苏联红军彻底埋葬的希特勒匪徒如此顶礼膜拜，而对自己民族的尊严，祖国的荣誉却极尽污辱践踏之能事。西蒙诺夫究竟是个什么东西，岂不是昭然若揭了吗！
    戈培尔在当年胡吹这套德国军队不可战胜的神话，是为希特勒独霸全球的狂妄计划服务的。今天，西蒙诺夫吹嘘昔日之德国法西斯的威武，目的是为了宣扬今日之美帝国主义的强大。当今的约翰逊就是六十年代的希特勒。苏修一伙，从赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金到西蒙诺夫之流，都是美帝国主义的“戈培尔”！
