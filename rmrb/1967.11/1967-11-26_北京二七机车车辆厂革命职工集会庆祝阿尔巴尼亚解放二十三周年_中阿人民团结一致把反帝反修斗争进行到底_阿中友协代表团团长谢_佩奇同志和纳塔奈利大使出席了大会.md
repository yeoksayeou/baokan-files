Beijing No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory's revolutionary workers and their families, together with Albanian comrades, celebrated the glorious holiday of the heroic Albanian people—the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation.

This factory, which has a revolutionary tradition, was filled with the atmosphere of revolutionary fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. When the delegation of the Albania-China Friendship Association, led by Comrade Shej Peçi, and Albanian Ambassador Natanaili arrived at the factory, the shouts of "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong" echoed through the factory. The workers held high portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," warmly welcoming the Albanian comrades.

At the celebration meeting for the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation held in the factory, Wang Feng, the chief of the factory's revolutionary committee, spoke first. He enthusiastically praised the heroic Albanian people for holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and making great contributions to the worldwide anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggle. He expressed that the Chinese working class and people would, together with the Albanian working class and people, carry the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle through to the end.

Comrade Shej Peçi said in his speech that the Albanian people and the great people of China have a great and unbreakable fighting friendship. In the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, our friendship and fighting unity are increasingly strengthened, and it will surely make new contributions to the socialist cause and the world revolution.

Comrade Shej Peçi highly evaluated the great significance of China's unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. He said that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, with its earth-shaking force, has dealt a devastating blow to the revisionists who attempt to obstruct the great advance of China towards socialism and communism. The victory of the proletarian cultural revolution is a great victory of Marxism-Leninism. It is not only of great historical significance to the destiny of Chinese socialism but also to the destiny of world socialism and the world revolution.

After Comrade Shej Peçi's speech, he presented a banner to the factory. The factory representatives presented an axe used by the old workers of No. 7 in their struggle against imperialism and feudal warlords to the Albanian comrades.

In the afternoon, the Albanian comrades visited the workshops of the No. 7 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory and were warmly welcomed by the workers. The responsible comrades of the factory's revolutionary committee also introduced the situation of the factory's successful development of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Accompanying the Albanian comrades to visit the factory and attend the celebration meeting were Chu Tu-nan, president of the China Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and representatives of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress.
