Albania's agriculture has made rapid strides and achieved tremendous successes. At present, 98% of the country's households and 98.3% of the cultivated land have joined agricultural cooperatives.

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 26 (Xinhua) — Over the past 23 years since liberation, under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania, Albania's socialist agriculture has achieved remarkable and daily-growing successes.

	Before liberation, Albania was a backward country with a small-scale peasant economy. After liberation, agriculture gradually realized socialist cooperation. Especially after the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, some mountainous villages that had not yet achieved collectivization were rapidly organized within less than three months. Now, 98% of the households and 98.3% of the cultivated land nationwide have joined cooperatives.

	In agricultural production, tremendous achievements have also been made. According to preliminary statistics, Albania's total agricultural output in 1967 will be nearly double that of the pre-war year 1938.

	In the development of farmland, water conservancy, and mechanization, outstanding achievements have also been made. Compared with 1938, the sown area nationwide has more than doubled, and the irrigated area has increased by 6.5 times. The once barren Malichi and Terbuf marshes have now become Albania's granaries. In 1938, Albania had only 30 standard tractors nationwide. Now, there are 8,900 standard tractors in regular use nationwide, with their work volume increased by 850 times compared with 1938.

	Over the past two years, Albania has launched a movement to further revolutionize national life and people's thinking. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been further enhanced. Especially after the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha's important speech on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the Government" on February 6 this year, the broad masses of agricultural laborers have resolutely fought against bureaucracy, religious superstition, backward customs, and bad elements that discriminate against women; they have also reduced private plots and paid more attention to the development of the collective economy.

	Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, pointed out at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, "The only way for socialist construction in rural areas is the collectivization of agriculture." "Developing agriculture is the most important link in completing the main economic tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan." "Increasing grain production is the fundamental task of agriculture and the entire national economy."

	Following these teachings, the broad masses of agricultural laborers in Albania have been universally mobilized, displaying the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. They have put forward the bold slogan of "reclaiming grain from barren mountains and hills" and launched a struggle against nature, developing agricultural production at a faster pace. In the first ten months of this year, the members of agricultural production cooperatives and state tractor stations across the country have completed this year's reclamation task of 2,800 hectares over the plan. During the same period, 11,000 hectares of terraced fields were built nationwide, and many water conservancy and irrigation projects were completed, increasing the fertilizer application for crops and strengthening field management. This year, the average yield of wheat nationwide has reached the highest level in history.

	Many mountainous agricultural cooperatives have begun to shake off the long-term dependence on state-subsidized grain and strive to sell surplus grain to the state.

	In the mountainous southern region of Albania, Tepelena, only 27 agricultural cooperatives could be self-sufficient in grain last year. This year, all 33 agricultural cooperatives in the entire region have achieved grain self-sufficiency.

	The Elbasan region also achieved grain self-sufficiency this year. Many members of the cooperatives in this region are not satisfied with the achievements they have made and are determined to struggle for surplus grain production.

	The farmers in the Skrapar mountainous region have worked hard to increase grain production, and many agricultural cooperatives have had a bumper harvest this year.

	The 17 agricultural cooperatives in the Dukagjin Mountains of the northern Shkodra region have fought tenaciously against the rugged high mountains and finally achieved grain self-sufficiency this year.

	The broad masses of cooperative members are also actively striving to sell surplus grain and other agricultural products to the state. This year, the state's procurement plans for sugar beets, tobacco, sunflowers, olives, dairy products, vegetables, and eggs will all be over-fulfilled.

	While actively developing agricultural production, the commercial network, power grid, road transportation, and cultural and health facilities in rural areas are also being continuously established and expanded.

	Now, after 23 years of brilliant achievements, the broad masses of agricultural laborers in Albania are welcoming the anniversary of the country's liberation with pride and great confidence. They are determined to follow the Party's instructions, strive for greater achievements, and strive for greater victories.

    敢于斗争　敢于胜利　向大自然开战　向荒山要粮
    阿尔巴尼亚农业迅速发展取得巨大成就
    目前全国百分之九十八的农户和百分之九十八点三的耕地都已入合作社
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三年来，在以霍查同志为首的劳动党的正确领导下，社会主义农业取得了日新月异的巨大成就。
    解放以前，阿尔巴尼亚是一个落后的小农经济的国家。解放以后，农业逐步实现了社会主义合作化，特别是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会以后，还没有实现集体化的一些山区农村在不到三个月的时间内就迅速地组织起来。现在，全国百分之九十八的农户和百分之九十八点三的耕地都已入社。
    在农业生产方面也取得了巨大的成就。据初步统计材料，一九六七年，阿尔巴尼亚全国农业总产值将比战前的一九三八年增长近两倍。
    在发展农田、兴修水利和机械化方面也取得了出色的成绩。同一九三八年相比，现在全国的播种面积扩大了一倍多，灌溉面积扩大了六点五倍。解放前荒凉的马利奇、特尔布弗等大面积沼泽地，现在变成了阿尔巴尼亚的谷仓。一九三八年，阿尔巴尼亚全国只有三十台（标准台）拖拉机。现在全国经常使用的拖拉机达八千九百台（标准台），其工作量比一九三八年增长了八百五十倍。
    近两年来，阿尔巴尼亚全国开展了国家生活和人的思想进一步革命化的运动，广大农民的社会主义觉悟有了进一步的提高。特别是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和霍查同志今年二月六日作了关于“党和政权的进一步革命化”的重要讲话以后，广大农业劳动者同官僚主义、宗教迷信、落后习俗和歧视妇女的坏人坏事进行了坚决斗争；他们并缩小了自留地，更加关心发展集体经济。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志在劳动党第五次代表大会上指出，“……农村社会主义建设的唯一道路是农业的集体化。”“发展农业是完成第四个五年计划主要经济任务的最主要的环节。”“增加粮食生产是农业和整个国民经济的基本任务。”
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者遵照这些教导，普遍动员起来，发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄气概，提出“向荒山秃岭要粮”的豪言壮语，向大自然开展斗争，以更快的步伐发展农业生产。今年头十个月，各地农业生产合作社社员和国营拖拉机站工人，就超计划二千八百公顷完成了今年全年的开荒任务。同一期间，全国共修筑梯田一万一千公顷，兴修了许多水利灌溉工程，增加了农作物的施肥量，并且加强了田间管理。今年全国小麦平均产量达到了历史上最高的水平。
    许多山区农业合作社已经开始摆脱长期以来依靠国家补助粮食的状况，并且争取向国家交售余粮。
    群山连绵的阿尔巴尼亚南部台佩莱纳区，去年只有二十七个农业合作社粮食能够自给，今年全区三十三个农业合作社已经全部做到粮食自给。
    爱尔塞克区今年也实现了粮食自给。这个区的许多合作社社员不满足于已得的成绩，决心为争取生产余粮而斗争。
    斯克拉巴里山区的农民努力增产粮食，许多农业合作社今年获得了大丰收。
    北部斯库台区杜卡金山区的十七个农业合作社的社员，同乱石峥嵘的高山展开顽强的斗争，也终于在今年实现了粮食自给。
    广大社员并积极争取向国家交售余粮和其它农产品。今年国家收购甜菜、烟草、向日葵、橄榄、奶类、蔬菜和蛋类的计划，都将超额完成。
    在积极发展农业生产的同时，农村的商业网、电力网、公路交通运输和文教卫生设施等，也正在不断建立和扩大。
    现在，在二十三年中取得了光辉成就的阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者，正怀着自豪的心情和百倍的信心，迎接祖国解放的节日。他们决心遵循党的指示，奋发图强，去争取更大的胜利。
