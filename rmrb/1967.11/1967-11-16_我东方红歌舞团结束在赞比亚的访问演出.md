The Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe successfully concluded its one-month friendly visit to the Republic of Zambia and departed for Tanzania on November 13, carrying with them the deep friendship of the Zambian people.

The Chinese troupe performed in nine cities across Zambia, giving a total of twenty shows to an audience of over 40,000 people.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and Vice President Simon Kapwepwe, along with officials from various local governments, attended the performances.

The performances by the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe, filled with revolutionary spirit, reflected the new spirit of the 700 million Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They also demonstrated the Chinese people's determination to support the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The performances were highly praised by the Zambian audience.

One spectator said, "The performance by the Chinese artists is the only truly people-oriented performance I have seen in many years. Your performance embodies an ideology—Mao Zedong Thought." A Zambian government official, after watching the performance in the capital Lusaka, said: "We have benefited greatly from your performance. The Zambian people want to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. We are friends in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism. No matter what happens, the eternal friendship between the peoples of China and Zambia is unbreakable."

The Chinese Embassy in Zambia held a reception on November 11 to celebrate the successful conclusion of the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe's visit to Zambia. Over 300 Zambian friends, including the Minister of Commerce and Industry and Foreign Trade, Elijah Mudenda, and the Minister of Local Government and Housing, Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, attended the reception.
