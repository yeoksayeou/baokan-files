The brave and skilled armed forces of the people of the southern Vietnamese province of Tuyen Duc, from October 28 to November 1, carried forward the spirit of fearless fatigue and continuous battle. They launched a series of fierce attacks on the enemy entrenched in the city of Loc Ninh, annihilating four American battalions and one company, severely damaging and annihilating one puppet battalion, nine companies, and one platoon, and shooting down and destroying eight enemy aircraft.

The report said that the battle to attack Loc Ninh city began late on the 28th. After a short period of fierce fighting, they entered the city and annihilated four enemy companies and four platoons. Under the heavy blows of the people's armed forces, the American invaders panicked and, in the afternoon of the 29th, dispatched a combat group of more than three battalions of American and puppet troops to rescue Loc Ninh. The people and soldiers of Tuyen Duc, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, were already well-prepared. They launched a sudden attack in the night of the 30th, while the enemy's footing was not yet stable, and quickly annihilated this combat group of enemies. On the night of the 31st, the people's armed forces, riding on the momentum of victory, launched a fierce artillery barrage on the invading bandits of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division stationed in Loc Ninh County, once again causing heavy casualties among the enemy. Immediately afterwards, on November 1, the people and soldiers of Tuyen Duc launched a fierce assault on the American troops in the Menh Lai area west of Loc Ninh County. After two hours of intense fighting, they annihilated one American battalion, destroyed two artillery positions, and shot down two enemy aircraft. At the same time, the people's armed forces also bombarded the enemy's military support base and the training base of the American special forces in Loc Ninh, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

The report said that during these five days, the people's armed forces also assisted the local people in rising up to overthrow the puppet regime's rule, severely punished a group of thugs in the local puppet government, and destroyed many "strategic hamlets." A large number of puppet soldiers deserted and fled.

    新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英勇善战的越南南方土龙木省人民解放武装力量，从十月二十八日到十一月一日，发扬不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，接连向盘踞在禄宁县城的敌人发动了猛烈的进攻，歼灭美军四个营和一个连，重创和消灭伪军一个营、九个连和一个排，击落击毁敌机八架。

    报道说，在这五天中，人民解放武装力量还协助当地人民奋起推翻伪政权的统治，严惩了当地伪政权中一批恶棍，并且捣毁了许多“战略村”。大批伪军士兵纷纷开小差逃跑。
