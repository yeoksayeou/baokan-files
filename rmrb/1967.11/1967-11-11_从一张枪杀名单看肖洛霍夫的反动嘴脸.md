Title: Seeing the Reactionary Face of Sholokhov Through a List of Executions

In the second part of *And Quiet Flows the Don*, Sholokhov lists a roll call of Red Army soldiers to be executed. This list tediously enumerates the names of seventy-five Red Army soldiers, followed by a “sentence” for each: the lightest being “executed by firing squad,” the heaviest “hanged.”

This list has no connection to the plot of the novel, yet Sholokhov spends so much ink and paper on it. Why? Is it to make people believe that the White Guards actually executed seventy-five Red Army soldiers in one go, thereby inciting hatred against the White Guards? Is it to make people see the brutality of the White Guards from the sentences of “execution” and “hanging”? No, not at all! This list reflects Sholokhov’s deep-seated hatred for the Soviet Red Army.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: “Towards the people, towards the people’s labor and struggle, towards the people’s army and the people’s party, we should of course praise them.”

In *And Quiet Flows the Don*, Sholokhov not only fails to depict the Red Army’s brave and tenacious fighting spirit and their fearlessness in the face of bloodshed and sacrifice, but instead, he deliberately defames the Red Army, fabricating their “ugly” behavior and cowardice on the battlefield. Let us quote a few passages:

	“In the Red Guard (note: the Red Guard is the precursor to the Red Army) lines scattered around the border of Narych Bay, there was a flurry of nervous activity. Many workers who had just picked up guns for the first time felt terrified and crawled around…”

	“…The terrified Stepanov, his face pale, squawked like a chicken nearby; behind him, a railway worker, a friend of Krutogorov, buried his head in the ground, crouched down, slightly raised his outstretched feet, and lay there like a turtle.”

This is a gross slander against the Soviet Red Army! We cannot help but ask: if the Soviet Red Army were such cowards, how did they defeat the ferocious attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies and achieve great victory in the civil war? How did the Red Army defeat the vicious fascist invaders and achieve great victory in the Patriotic War?

Sholokhov not only portrays Red Army soldiers as cowards but also imposes the corrupt and ugly soul of the bourgeoisie onto the Soviet Red Army. In his depiction, every Red Army soldier is a drunkard, a smoker, a womanizer, and a gambler. He blatantly writes:

	“The Red Guards looted indiscriminately along the way… They ignored the threats and orders from the command, marching in droves into the village, starting to slaughter sheep, and in one corner of the village, they raped two Cossack women… By night, the entire column was filled with the smell of alcohol (every supply wagon was loaded with alcohol).”

	“The Red Guards in Petrov’s unit and the sailors who had recently arrived in Mokro-Ussovo were playing ‘big points’ at the table. Surrounded by the smell of tobacco, they loudly threw their cards.”

Sholokhov actually portrays the Red Army, which was personally founded by Lenin and Stalin, as even worse than the White Guard army! This is a wanton defamation of the Soviet Red Army!

Sholokhov also deliberately places the Red Army in an antagonistic position with the people. In his depiction, the Soviet Red Army is like a “savage” and “bandit” horde, wherever they go, there is wailing and chaos, crops are destroyed, and houses are burned. The people hate the Red Army to the core, and when they see the Red Army, they flee like they would from a plague. “The Cossacks looked at each other and began to silently disperse. The girls and children ran away in a clatter. After five minutes, the street was dead silent.” However, when they heard that they were going to fight the Red Army, “from sixteen to seventy years old,” everyone who could pick up a gun did so.

This is pure fabrication and malicious attack! Sholokhov’s insult to the Soviet Red Army and the Soviet people has reached a frenzied level!

All of this proves that Sholokhov stands on the side of the enemies of the Soviet Red Army to depict the Red Army. Every word he uses to describe the Red Army is a poisoned arrow and a poisoned knife aimed at the Red Army. This is why he gnashed his teeth and, with his black pen, “executed” seventy-five Red Army soldiers in one go, listing this black roll call, and putting on the face of an executioner on the scaffold. This list of executions exposes his ugly and reactionary soul to the Soviet people and the people of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “In this world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason.” Sholokhov’s deep-seated hatred for the Soviet Red Army is determined by his class nature. Sholokhov was born into a family of a mill manager who was good at scheming and profiteering. The cannon fire of the October Revolution sounded, and the Soviet Red Army destroyed the rule of the tsar and repulsed the ferocious attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies; at the same time, it also disrupted the capitalist dreams of ambitious people like Sholokhov. Can Sholokhov not harbor resentment in his heart? To overthrow the Soviet government and restore their lost “paradise,” he wields the black pen of counter-revolution, cheering for the counter-revolutionary restorationists, and viciously attacks the pillar of the Soviet government, the Soviet Red Army.

We solemnly warn the likes of Sholokhov: don’t be too happy too soon! The wheel of history is unstoppable! The Soviet people are brewing a second revolution. One day, the Soviet people will re-establish their own armed forces, pick up the guns of revolution, and rise up in revolt, bringing about a second 1917. Your doomsday will arrive!

### 从一张枪杀名单看肖洛霍夫的反动嘴脸

    从一张枪杀名单看肖洛霍夫的反动嘴脸
    解放军某部五好战士　姚永亮
    在《静静的顿河》的第二部里，肖洛霍夫开列了一张枪杀红军战士的名单。这张名单不厌其烦地排列了七十五名红军战士的名字，又在每个人的名字下面一个个作了“判决”：轻者“枪决”，重者“绞首”。
    这张名单与小说情节毫无关系，可是，肖洛霍夫却如此不惜篇章，不惜笔墨，这是为什么？是要人们相信白匪确实一次就枪杀了七十五名红军战士，从而激发人们对白匪的仇恨吗？是要人们从“枪决”“绞首”的判决中，看到白匪的凶狠残暴吗？不是，完全不是！这张名单反映了肖洛霍夫对苏联红军的刻骨仇恨。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“对人民群众，对人民的劳动和斗争，对人民的军队，人民的政党，我们当然应该赞扬。”
    肖洛霍夫在《静静的顿河》中，不但不描写红军的勇敢顽强的杀敌精神，不怕流血牺牲的战斗意志，相反，却是竭力丑化红军，随心所欲地捏造红军在战场上的“丑态”和贪生怕死的“心理”。我们不妨摘引几段：
      “散布在拿里柴湾的边境上的赤卫军（注：赤卫军即红军前身）阵线中间显出了奔忙的不安。许多头一次拿起枪的工人们感到了恐怖，爬来爬去……”。
      “……恐怖得脸发绿的司台潘诺夫在他附近象鸡一般叫；后面是克鲁托郭诺夫的朋友，一个铁路工人把头钻进土里，弯着身子，略微把伸出去的脚颠起了一点，象乌龟一般伏着。”
    这是对苏联红军天大的污蔑！我们不禁要问：如果苏联红军是这样的“怕死鬼”，那么，苏联红军是如何战胜国内外阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，取得国内战争的伟大胜利的呢？红军又是如何打败凶恶的法西斯强盗，取得卫国战争的伟大胜利的呢？
    肖洛霍夫不仅把红军战士描写成“怕死鬼”，而且还把资产阶级腐朽丑恶的灵魂强加到苏联红军身上。在他的笔下，红军战士个个都是“喝”不够的酒鬼，“抽”不够的烟鬼，“玩”不够的色鬼，“赌”不够的财鬼。他赤裸裸地写道：
      “赤卫军沿途任意掳掠。……他们不管指挥部的恐吓与禁令，成堆地向村中走去，开始杀羊，在村庄的一头强奸了两个哥萨克女子，……夜里队伍全部充满了酒气（每一辆辎重车上都载了酒精）”。
      “彼得洛夫队伍中的赤卫军和不久以前开到莫柯洛乌索夫的海军在桌旁掷‘大点儿’。被烟草的气息熏蒸着的他们响亮地掷着纸牌”。
    肖洛霍夫竟然把列宁、斯大林亲自缔造的苏联红军写得比白匪军还要坏！这是对苏联红军恣意的丑化！
    肖洛霍夫还硬把红军放在同人民敌对的位置上。在他的笔下，苏联红军象“野蛮的”“盗群”，所到之处，鬼哭神嚎，鸡犬不宁，庄稼被毁，房屋被烧。人民对红军恨之入骨，见了红军就象见了瘟神一样，“哥萨克们互相望着，开始沉默地散开了，姑娘和小孩子们唏哩哗啦都跑了。过了五分钟，街道变成死的了。”然而，听说要打红军，“从十六岁到七十岁”“一切能拿起枪来的”人都拿起枪来了。
    这是纯粹的捏造，恶毒的攻击！肖洛霍夫污辱苏联红军和苏联人民，已经达到了疯狂的地步！
    这一切都证明：肖洛霍夫完全是站在苏联红军的敌人的立场上来描写红军的。他所用来描写红军的一字一句，都是射向红军的毒箭，砍向红军的毒刀。正因为如此，他才咬牙切齿地用他的黑笔一气“枪杀”了七十五名红军战士，开了这张黑名单，摆出一副刑场上刽子手特有的面孔来。这张枪杀名单，把他既丑恶而又反动的灵魂活生生地暴露在苏联人民和世界人民面前。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”肖洛霍夫这样刻骨仇视苏联红军是他的阶级本性所决定的。肖洛霍夫出生在一个善于钻营牟利的“磨坊经理”的家庭。十月革命的炮声响了，苏联红军摧毁了沙皇的统治，击退了国内外阶级敌人的猖狂进攻；同时，也搅乱了象肖洛霍夫这样野心勃勃的财迷们发展资本主义的美梦。对此，肖洛霍夫能不怀恨在心吗？为了推翻苏维埃政权，恢复他们失去的“天堂”，他操起反革命的黑笔杆，为反革命复辟狂们捧场喝采，对苏维埃政权的柱石苏联红军肆意进行攻击。
    我们要严正警告肖洛霍夫之流，别高兴得太早了！历史的车轮，是挡不住的！苏联人民正在孕育着第二次革命，总有一天，苏联人民要重新建立自己的武装，拿起革命的枪杆子起来造反，出现第二个一九一七年。你们的末日就要来临了！
