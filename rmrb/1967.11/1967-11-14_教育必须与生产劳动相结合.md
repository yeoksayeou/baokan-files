Title: Education Must Be Combined with Productive Labor

Education must be combined with productive labor. I graduated from a technical school in 1961 and was assigned to work at a certain design unit. From more than six years of practical work, I deeply feel that "education must be revolutionized." The old education system is seriously disconnected from production, with theory detached from practice, resulting in what is learned being useless. Most of the content we studied in school does not align with practical needs, and some of it is completely unsuitable for socialist construction. Our method of studying was rote memorization, spending the whole day from the dormitory to the dining hall, and from the dining hall to the classroom. What the teachers taught and what we learned was all from books to books, from theory to theory. Most of what I learned in school is now useless in my actual work.

The old education system causes a disconnect between teaching, design, and construction. We students who come out of school only know how to copy from others and have to carry a basket of books to the site, truly losing our way without a cane. As a result, we often bump our heads in the face of reality. For example, once a technician designed a project requiring a cast-iron pipe with a diameter of ninety centimeters, six meters long, and nearly two tons in weight, without considering how to install such a massive object to the designated position. Workers asked the designer for a solution, but the designer was also at a loss and had to admit that they had no idea, designing it "as if." In actual work, following the old methods from school, flipping through books, looking at samples, and copying blindly, it is common to see designs that cannot be implemented.

From a political standpoint, China's Khrushchev advocates for "striving to be first in technology," "to cultivate experts, one can prevent them from joining the party and participating in political activities," promoting "two ears deaf to outside affairs, one heart devoted to reading sacred books," promoting fame and fortune, fame and benefit, and relentlessly instilling bourgeois ideology into the minds of the youth, cultivating bourgeois successors. How can such a situation continue!

    教育必须与生产劳动相结合
    我是一九六一年从技术学校毕业的，毕业后分配到某设计单位工作。从六年多的实际工作中，我深深体会到“教育要革命”。旧的教育制度严重地与生产脱节，理论脱离实际，以致所学非所用。我们在学校读的书，大部分内容和实际结合不起来，有的根本不适合社会主义建设的需要。我们读书的方式是注入式的，一天到晚就是从宿舍到饭堂，由饭堂再到教室。老师教的和自己学的，都是从书本到书本，从理论到理论。我过去在学校学的东西，现在在实际工作中大部分都用不上。
    旧的教育制度造成教学、设计和施工三者脱离。我们这些从学校出来的学生，只会抄人家的东西，去现场还要背上一篓筐书，真是丢了拐棍走不了路。结果常常在实际面前碰得头破血流。比如有一次一个技术员为某工程设计，要求工程用直径九十厘米粗、六米长、近二吨重的铸铁管，但是根本没有考虑怎样才能把这样的庞然大物安装到预定的位置上去。工人们请设计人员想办法，设计人员也抓瞎，只好承认自己也没有办法，是“想当然”设计出来的。在实际工作中，只按学校的老方法，翻本本，看样本，照抄照搬，设计出来的图纸无法施工的现象是屡见不鲜的。
    再从政治上看，中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“在技术上力争第一”，“为了培养专家，可以不让他们入党，不让他们参加政治活动”，宣扬“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，宣扬成名成家，有名有利，拚命往青年的脑子里灌输资产阶级思想，培养资产阶级的接班人。这样的情况怎么能继续下去呵！
