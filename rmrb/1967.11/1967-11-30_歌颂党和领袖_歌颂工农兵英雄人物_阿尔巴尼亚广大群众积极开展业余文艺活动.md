In the sweeping cultural revolution that has engulfed Albania, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, who hold a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, are actively engaged in amateur arts activities under the leadership of party organizations at all levels. They enthusiastically sing the praises of the Party of Labor and the beloved leader Enver Hoxha, enthusiastically sing the praises of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and vigorously promote the current revolutionary movement and the Party's policies.

Recently, the Korça region held a music and dance performance. One hundred amateur performance troupes from cities and villages in this region participated in the performance. More than 50% of the songs they sang were self-composed. In the vast rural areas of Shkodër, 170 amateur performance troupes have been established, forming a powerful force to propagate the Party's policies and the revolutionary movement in the countryside. In the mountainous rural areas of the previously backward districts of Mirdita and Librazhd, amateur arts activities are also flourishing. Under the inspiration of Comrade Hoxha's report on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" delivered in February this year, Albanian women have broken free from the shackles of feudal patriarchal ideology, daringly risen up in rebellion, and bravely stepped onto the stage. In the Mat district's Kurdali Agricultural Cooperative alone, more than 70 female members have joined the amateur arts group and performed in other cooperatives.

In the performances, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, with deep gratitude and love for the Party and Comrade Hoxha, sincerely sing praises of their beloved leader and the new socialist life. Recently, in the amateur drama performance held in Shkodër by township, the amateur actors performed "Singing Praises to Our Dear Party" and "Welcome, Comrade Enver, to Our Place for Inspection."

Drawing creative themes from the fiery class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments is a distinctive feature of Albanian workers', peasants', and soldiers' arts. Following the play "Our Collective's Son," which praises the communist warrior Adam Reka, the workers of the "Mihal Mirdita" handicraft cooperative in Tirana created and performed the large-scale song and dance drama "Adam Reka." The amateur actors of the "Petroleum Workers" Cultural Palace in Stalin City recently self-composed and performed a large-scale poetic chorus praising Muhamed Hixha and Murtaz Kapi, heroes of the petroleum front who were martyred in a fire last year, and received the audience's praise. The soldiers of the People's Army, who are always vigilant in defending the socialist motherland, have also composed and performed many artistic programs depicting revolutionary heroes.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers in various places also use artistic forms to combine current struggles and vigorously promote Comrade Hoxha's important report and the current revolutionary movement. The amateur performance troupe in Pukë, in response to Comrade Hoxha's call at the Fifth National Congress of the Party of Labor to turn barren mountains into fertile land, self-composed and performed the drama "The Mountains Are Laughing" and performed in the labor sites of mountain road construction and many villages, powerfully inspiring people to fight against nature.

    歌颂党和领袖　歌颂工农兵英雄人物
    阿尔巴尼亚广大群众积极开展业余文艺活动
    据新华社地拉那电　在席卷阿尔巴尼亚全国的轰轰烈烈的思想文化革命化运动中，一手拿镐，一手拿枪的阿尔巴尼亚广大工农兵群众，在各级党组织领导下，积极开展业余文艺活动，热情歌颂劳动党和敬爱的领袖霍查同志，热情歌颂工农兵英雄人物，大力宣传当前的革命化运动和党的政策。
    不久前，科尔察区举行了音乐舞蹈会演。来自这个区的城市和农村的一百个业余演出团体参加了会演。他们演唱的歌曲中，百分之五十以上是自己创作的。在斯库台的广大农村里，已经建立了一百七十个业余演出团体，组成了在农村中宣传党的政策和革命化运动的一支强大队伍。以前比较落后的米尔迪塔区和利布拉什德区的山区农村，业余文艺活动也正在蓬勃开展起来。在霍查同志今年二月六日关于“党和政权的进一步革命化”的报告的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚广大妇女摆脱了封建宗法思想枷锁的束缚，大胆地起来造反，勇敢地登上了舞台。仅马蒂区库尔达里农业社，就有七十多名女社员参加了业余艺术团体，并到其他合作社演出。
    在演出的节目中，广大的工农兵群众怀着对党和霍查同志无限感激的深情，衷心歌唱自己的敬爱领袖和社会主义新生活。不久前在斯库台举行的以乡为单位的杂剧会演中，业余演员们演出了《歌唱亲爱的党》、《欢迎恩维尔同志到我们这里来视察》等节目。
    从火热的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中挖掘创作题材，是阿尔巴尼亚工农兵文艺的显著特点。继歌颂共产主义战士亚当·雷卡的话剧《我们集体的儿子》后，地拉那“米杰尼”手工业合作社的职工创作并演出了大型歌舞剧《亚当·雷卡》。斯大林城“石油工人”文化宫的业余演员，不久前自编自演了歌颂去年被大火烧伤英勇牺牲的石油战线上的英雄穆哈梅特·希胡和穆尔特扎·凯皮的大型诗歌联唱，受到了观众的赞扬。时刻警惕地捍卫着社会主义祖国的人民军战士，也编演了许多描写革命英雄形象的文艺节目。
    各地工农兵群众，还通过文艺形式，结合当前斗争，大力宣传霍查同志的重要报告和当前的革命化运动。普克区的业余演出团，为响应霍查同志在劳动党第五次全国代表大会上发出的把荒山变成富饶土地的战斗号召，自编自演了杂剧《高山在欢笑》，并到修筑山区公路的劳动工地和许多农村进行演出，有力地鼓舞着人们同大自然作斗争。
