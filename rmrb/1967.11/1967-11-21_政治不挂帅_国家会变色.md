	Mao Zedong Quotations
	Politics is the commander, the soul.
	The basic task of political work is to continually instill socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticize capitalist tendencies.
	Chinese Khrushchev's black words: I think the main contradiction lies in the distribution problem. If workers and peasants do not get enough, they will cause trouble. If you give them more, it will be easier to educate them. Feed them first, and if they don't work hard, it will be easier to criticize them.

	Without Political Leadership, the Country Will Change Color

	Li Shusong, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, political leader of the Fourth Production Brigade

	These black words of Chinese Khrushchev are indeed sugar-coated poison, sweet on the outside but deadly inside.

	Does the main contradiction in the countryside lie in the distribution problem? No, no, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no. The principal contradiction during the transitional period is between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. The fundamental issue in the countryside is the question of which road to take. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and insisting on political leadership, "continuously instilling socialist ideology in the peasant masses and criticizing capitalist tendencies," can we consolidate and develop the collective economy and ensure that our peasants advance along the socialist path.

	"The more you give them, the easier it is to educate them." This statement is even more vicious, completely in the tone of landlords and capitalists. In the past, landlords and capitalists did exactly this: give you a little sweetener to make you listen to them and let them exploit you.

	Chinese Khrushchev's black words, boiled down, are all about not having political leadership and promoting material incentives to achieve his plot to restore capitalism.

	What kind of enthusiasm does material incentive stimulate? It only stimulates individualistic and capitalist "enthusiasm." If we fall for Chinese Khrushchev's poison and implement material incentives, the thoughts of the community members will become more and more confused. Without political leadership and implementing the piecework system, when working on a piecework basis, to grab work points, people only care about quantity, not quality. They rush to the fields to grab the best spots; the clods are as big as bowls, the smallest as fists, whether they are cat heads or dog heads, as long as the work points are right. When doing daily miscellaneous work, they don't care about efficiency, they lag behind in going to the fields, look at the situation, work lazily, and consider a day's work done. When it comes to evaluating work points, they argue and quarrel, just as the community members say, "Deducting a fen is like cutting off a tongue." In short, material incentives only make the "self" spread and capitalist tendencies flourish. If we continue this way, the collective economy will collapse, the countryside will change, the poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice, and endure twice the hardship. Implementing material incentives is to implement the restoration of capitalism, isn't this obvious?

	Political leadership, everything goes smoothly; without politics, everything is empty. We must thoroughly criticize Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of material incentives, eliminate its poison, insist on emphasizing politics, and insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. We must turn the countryside into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 政治不挂帅  国家会变色

    毛主席语录
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。
    政治工作的基本任务是向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：我想，这矛盾主要重大表现在分配问题上，工人农民分配不多就要闹事。给了他，更容易教育他。先给你吃饱，你不好好工作，就好批评。
    政治不挂帅  国家会变色
    学习毛主席著作积极分子第四生产队政治队长  李树松
    中国赫鲁晓夫这些黑话，真是砂糖夹砒霜，甜里带毒，毒透毒透。
    农村的矛盾“主要重大表现在分配问题上”吗？不是，不是，一千个不是，一万个不是。过渡时期的主要矛盾是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的矛盾。农村的根本问题，是走什么道路的问题。只有象毛主席教导的那样，坚持政治挂帅，“向农民群众不断地灌输社会主义思想，批评资本主义倾向”，才能巩固和发展集体经济，保证我们农民沿着社会主义的方向前进。
    “给了他，更容易教育他。”这种话，更是恶毒，完全是地主、资本家的腔调。过去地主、资本家就是这样做的，先给你一点甜头，要你好好听他的话，让他剥削。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这些黑话，讲来讲去就是要我们不要政治挂帅，去搞物质刺激，好让他实现复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    物质刺激会刺激出什么样的干劲来？只能刺激出个人主义的“干劲”，资本主义的“干劲”。要是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，搞什么物质刺激，社员思想就会越弄越糊涂。政治不挂帅，实行定额记分制，做计件工的时候，为了抢工分，只管数量，不管质量，出工抢在前头，到了田头抢好?头，泥块大的象钵头，小的象拳头，不管猫头狗头，只要工分对头；做起按日计算的杂务工，就不讲工效，出工落在后头，到了田头，看看苗头，干活当中，撑撑锄头，做过一天就算数。评起工分，你争我吵，真象社员讲的，“扣掉一分厘头，好比割掉舌头”。总之一句话，物质刺激只会使“私”字泛滥，资本主义倾向大发展。这样搞下去，集体经济就会垮台，农村就会变天，贫下中农就会吃二遍苦，受二遍罪。搞物质刺激，就是搞资本主义复辟，这不是很明显的吗？
    政治挂帅，一通百通；离开政治，一空百空。我们一定要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫物质刺激的谬论，肃清它的流毒，坚持突出政治，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
