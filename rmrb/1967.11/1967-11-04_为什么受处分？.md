In the Bryansk Gas Trust, turner Balyasnikov and engineer Tredtyakov are both Communist Party members. The two had a heated argument over an issue. One said this, the other said that, the argument turned into a quarrel, and finally ended in mutual insults. Of course, both sides were at fault. But how did the Party Executive Committee of the Trust handle this matter? It decided to punish only the turner Balyasnikov.

The turner Balyasnikov indignantly said that the meaning of the speeches made at the meeting of the Party Executive Committee could be summed up as follows: one can forgive the leader, but not the worker. The secretary of the Party Executive Committee bluntly stated: "Comrade Tredtyakov is the chief engineer, while Balyasnikov is just a worker, and therefore they cannot be treated equally." Infuriated by this attitude, Balyasnikov left the meeting to protest. The Party Executive Committee then gave Balyasnikov a warning for "insulting the chief engineer" and for walking out of the executive committee meeting.

However, the punishment did not subdue the turner Balyasnikov; instead, it made him see more clearly that under the rule of the revisionist clique, workers are considered inferior to engineers and experts. He said: "I think the punishment given to me is unjust. If the engineer had also been punished, it would have been different. Now I have come to the conclusion: the chief engineer and I are both Communist Party members, but we are not equal. He has certain rights, while I do not. What is allowed for him is not allowed for me."

    为什么受处分？
    在布良斯克州煤气托拉斯，旋工巴利亚斯尼科夫和工程师特列季雅科夫都是共产党员。他们两人为一件事展开了激烈的争论。你一句，我一句，争论变成了争吵，最后以互相谩骂结束。当然，双方都有责任。可是托拉斯的党执行委员会是如何处理这件事的呢？它决定仅仅处分旋工巴利亚斯尼科夫。
    旋工巴利亚斯尼科夫气愤地说，在党的执行委员会会议上发言的意思可以归纳为：可以原谅领导人，但不能原谅工人。党执行委员会书记直截了当地说：“特列季雅科夫同志是总工程师，而巴利亚斯尼科夫只不过是一个工人，因而，不能平等相待。”被这种态度激怒了的巴利亚斯尼科夫离开了会场，以表示抗议。党的执行委员会就以“侮辱总工程师”和退出执行委员会会议的罪名给予巴利亚斯尼科夫警告处分。
    然而处分不但没有压服旋工巴利亚斯尼科夫，反而使他更看清楚了在苏修集团统治下的工人是比工程师、专家低一等的。他说：“我认为，对我的处分是不对的。如果也处分了工程师，那就不一样了。现在我得出这样的结论：总工程师和我都是共产党员，但是彼此是不平等的。他有一种权利，而我却没有。允许他做的事情，却不允许我做。”
