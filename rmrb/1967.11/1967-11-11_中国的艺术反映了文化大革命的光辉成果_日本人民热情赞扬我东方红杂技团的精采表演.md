China's art reflects the glorious achievements of the Cultural Revolution. The Japanese people enthusiastically praise the superb performance of the Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe.

According to Xinhua News Agency, according to the East Asian News Agency: The superb performance of the Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe from China in Japan has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. They cheer for the victory of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution and express their boundless respect and love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Professor Inoue Kiyoshi of Kyoto University, after watching the performance, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary nature of Chinese acrobatics. He said, "The Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe uses the form of acrobatics to vividly perform the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fully reflecting the boundless enthusiasm of the Chinese people in responding to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness. This is an important reform that pushes acrobatics to a new stage. This also shows the glorious achievements of the Cultural Revolution, which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

Ideshi Kazuo, a social activist from the Hyogo Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), was deeply moved after watching the acrobatics troupe's performance. He said, "The Chinese acrobatics performance shows that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a great people. Although the Japanese Communist Party revisionists have viciously attacked the great Chairman Mao, this in no way diminishes the sun-like brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, nor can it stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought among the Japanese people."

Sakaue Shigeo, a social activist from the Hyogo Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, "The Chinese acrobatics troupe's performance was excellent. We have boundless love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. Every time the stage shows the image of the benevolent and radiant Chairman Mao, I feel a sense of reverence that is indescribable. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will definitely achieve victory in the struggle."

Daisuke Otaka, the principal of the Osaka Japan-China Friendship Academy, enthusiastically praised the performance of the Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe.

He said, "The performance of the Chinese acrobatics troupe is full of the courageous spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the 700 million Chinese people." He said, "The Chinese acrobatics art, which has been tempered and developed through the proletarian Cultural Revolution, makes us believe that as long as the people are armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles."

In Kyoto, a 76-year-old elderly person wrote in the guestbook: "Advancing along the brilliant path indicated by Chairman Mao is victory." Another audience member from Osaka wrote, "The superb skills with the theme of praising workers, peasants, and soldiers are excellent." "Chinese acrobatics embodies Chairman Mao's policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art."

A 52-year-old teacher in Kyoto wrote in the guestbook, "The superb performance of the Chinese acrobatics troupe makes one deeply feel the greatness of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution. The acrobats' powerful, healthy, and boundlessly respectful performance for Chairman Mao reflects the glorious victory of the Cultural Revolution under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership." A 19-year-old female student, after watching the acrobatics performance, told a Chinese reporter, "We feel incredibly fortunate to have Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's people." She also told the Chinese reporter, "Please convey the greetings of Japanese youth to the Chinese people and wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Kondo Ryozaburo, the chairman of the Kyoto branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said, "The 700 million Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting to 'criticize and repudiate revisionism' to ensure that socialist China will never change color. The excellent programs of the Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe were created in the Cultural Revolution, which is advancing from victory to victory under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao. The visit of the Chinese acrobatics troupe to Japan will definitely bring new encouragement and strength to the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people."

The Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe was able to perform in Nagoya thanks to the efforts of the Aichi Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) overcoming various difficulties and fighting tenaciously against the obstruction and sabotage of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. The chairman of this organization, the famous physicist Ariyama Kenko, told the troupe leader, "The acrobatics now are completely different from before. Watching it gives one a lot of strength." The chairman Murai Ryoichi enthusiastically said, "The superb performance of the Dongfanghong Acrobatics Troupe has planted the seeds of friendship between the peoples of China and Japan."

A 18-year-old young worker in Nagoya expressed the audience's feelings in the guestbook. He wrote:

"The superb performance shows that the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to criticize and repudiate revisionism. Such a revolution is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

    中国的艺术反映了文化大革命的光辉成果
    日本人民热情赞扬我东方红杂技团的精采表演
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：中国东方红杂技团在日本进行的精采表演，受到了广大日本人民的热烈欢迎，他们欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，对伟大领袖毛主席表示了无比的崇敬和爱戴。
    京都大学教授井上清看了演出后热情地赞扬中国杂技艺术的革命化。他说：“东方红杂技团运用杂技艺术的形式，大力表演工农兵的英雄形象，充分地反映了中国人民响应毛主席的抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备的号召而迸发出来的冲天干劲，这是把杂技艺术推向一个新阶段的重要改革。这也显示了文化大革命的光辉成果，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部社会活动家郡司和男看了杂技团的表演后极为感动。他说，中国的杂技表演表明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是伟大的人民。尽管日共修正主义分子对伟大的毛主席进行了恶毒的攻击，但是，这丝毫不能减弱毛泽东思想的太阳般的光辉，也不能阻挡毛泽东思想在日本人民中间广泛的传播。
    日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部社会活动家阪上重夫说：“中国杂技团的表演太好了。我们无限热爱世界人民伟大的领袖毛主席。每当舞台上映出了慈祥的光辉的毛主席的形象时，我就产生一种说不出来的肃然起敬的感情。我们只要按照毛主席的指示办事，就一定会取得斗争的胜利。”
    大阪日中友好学院院长大塚有章，热烈赞扬中国东方红杂技团的演出。
    他说：“中国杂技团的表演充满了中国七亿人民的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英勇气概。”他说，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼发展起来的中国杂技艺术使我们确信，人民群众只要以伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，就能创造奇迹。
    在京都，一位七十六岁的老人，在留言簿上写道：“沿着毛主席指出的光辉道路前进，就是胜利。”另一位来自大阪的观众写道：“以歌颂工农兵为主题的高超技艺，好得很。”“中国杂技体现了毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方针。”
    京都一位五十二岁的教师在留言中写道：“中国杂技团的精采演出，使人深深感到中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大。杂技演员那种强有力的、健康的、充满着对毛主席无限敬爱的表演，反映了在毛主席英明领导下的文化大革命的光辉胜利。”一个十九岁的女学生在看完杂技演出后，对中国记者说：“我们以有毛主席这样英明的世界人民的伟大领袖而感到无比幸福。”她还对中国记者说：“请转达日本青年对中国人民的问候，祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！”
    日中友好协会（正统）京都总部理事长近藤良男说：“七亿中国人民正在毛泽东思想的指引下，展开‘斗私，批修’，为使社会主义中国永不变色而斗争。东方红杂技团的优秀节目，是在毛主席亲自发动和领导下从胜利走向胜利的无产阶级文化大革命中创作出来的，是沿着毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线前进的。中国杂技团的访日公演，一定会给日本人民的革命斗争带来新的鼓舞和力量。”
    东方红杂技团在名古屋能够公演，是由于日中友好协会（正统）爱知县总部克服了各种困难，在同日共修正主义的阻挠和破坏作顽强斗争中实现的。这个组织的会长、著名物理学者有山兼孝对杂技团团长说，“现在的杂技和以前的大不相同了，看了它，给人增加了很大的力量。”理事长村井泷一热情地说：“东方红杂技团的精采表演，为日中两国人民播下了友谊的种子。”
    名古屋的一位十八岁的青年工人在留言簿上表达了观众的感想。他写道：
  “精采的演出，表明中国无产阶级文化大革命是破私立公的大革命，这样的革命，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想的胜利。”
