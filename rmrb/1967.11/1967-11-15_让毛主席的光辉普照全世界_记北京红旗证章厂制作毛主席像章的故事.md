The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Red Flag Badge Factory have been meticulously producing badges of our great leader Chairman Mao since the beginning. They have received countless letters from all over the country and from around the world. Each letter is filled with gratitude and heartfelt hopes.

A group of naval soldiers wrote: "How much we need to wear Chairman Mao's badges! Wearing it, we will never lose our way in the vast ocean. Wearing it, we can stand firmly on the deck in high winds and waves. Wearing it, we are always spirited and full of fighting spirit, full of strength. Wearing it, we are filled with hatred towards the enemy. Wearing it, we think of our compatriots in Taiwan and the three billion oppressed class brothers around the world, bravely fighting on the ocean."

A soldier from the People's Liberation Army of South Vietnam, who was fighting on the anti-American front, received a Chairman Mao badge. He held it in both hands, looked north, and chanted, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, long live Chairman Mao!" Then he wore it proudly on his chest and bravely joined the battle.

In Albania, on the anti-revisionist front, people have an infinite love for Chairman Mao. Once, after a performance by a Chinese song and dance troupe, the audience eagerly asked the performers for Chairman Mao badges. In an instant, all the badges were taken. People carefully wore them on their chests, looking at Chairman Mao's badge with deep affection, and excitedly shouted, "Mao Zedong!"

In Leipzig, there was a retired old worker who had an infinite love for Chairman Mao and hoped to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. Later, his wish came true, and he was overjoyed. No matter how strictly the revisionists monitored him, the old worker always wore the Chairman Mao badge on his chest. He said, "Wearing Chairman Mao's badge on my chest makes me forever young and more powerful."

A young man from Myanmar wrote: "Every time I see someone wearing a Chairman Mao badge on their chest, I envy them and look at their chest several times. Later, I obtained one, but a friend from the mountains wrote to me asking for it. I knew that people in the mountains had more difficulty obtaining a Chairman Mao badge than we did in Yangon. I thought for a long time, should I give it or not? I only have this one! At this moment, I thought of Dr. Norman Bethune's selfless spirit, dedicating himself to others, and decided to give my only Chairman Mao badge to them. I eagerly hope that you will produce more Chairman Mao badges."

Is this just a letter? No, it is the hearts of millions of people who love Chairman Mao flying towards Beijing. It shows that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon the entire world, and the great image of Chairman Mao greatly inspires the revolutionary people of the world to fight unyieldingly against all enemies.

Letter after letter filled with excitement has greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Red Flag Badge Factory.

However, the factory experienced an unusual struggle in the production of Chairman Mao badges.

At the beginning, the workers of the Red Flag Badge Factory produced the badges with hearts full of infinite love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. The first person to think of producing Chairman Mao badges was the mold worker Tian Zhihai. He became an apprentice at the factory in 1962. At that time, the country was in the midst of a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works. Tian Zhihai was puzzled by a phenomenon in the factory: why were they only producing "long-life locks" and other "four olds" products, and not making Chairman Mao badges? He decided to forge a new path.

To carve the mold for Chairman Mao badges, one must be able to sculpt Chairman Mao's image, but he had never learned sculpture, and carving molds was difficult. However, difficulties could not deter a worker who loved Chairman Mao. Starting in August 1965, Tian Zhihai began collecting images of Chairman Mao from the People's Daily, carefully observing and thinking. He used his saved wages to buy clay and plaster to practice sculpting. The factory's clique of capitalists within the party knew about this and considered it "not doing one's job," not giving him time to practice. This did not deter Tian Zhihai. He used his rest time to practice sculpting, often sculpting until midnight or one or two in the morning. The first few dozen times, he could not sculpt it right. What should he do? So he sat down to study Chairman Mao's works. He believed that to carve the brilliant image of Chairman Mao, one must first carve the brilliant image of Chairman Mao in one's heart. He did not know how many sleepless nights he spent, but finally, he sculpted a half-bust of Chairman Mao that he was somewhat satisfied with. He took it to his neighbors for their opinions, even to a three-year-old child, asking, "Who is this?" The child laughed and said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao." Tian Zhihai was overjoyed. To sculpt Chairman Mao's image, he spent a full eight months.

With the help of many veteran workers, Tian Zhihai carved the first set of molds for Chairman Mao badges and requested that the factory's leadership arrange for the production of Chairman Mao badges. The factory leadership had to agree to produce 300,000 Chairman Mao badges per month.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began! Chairman Mao's works were in short supply, and Chairman Mao badges were also in short supply. The revolutionary workers of the Red Flag Badge Factory posted big-character posters in the factory, exposing the crimes of the clique of capitalists within the party who followed the revisionist line, denouncing them for producing only "long-life," "three immortals," and "qilin" locks, while refusing to produce Chairman Mao badges. At that time, the clique of capitalists within the party used excuses such as "no orders, the plan cannot be arranged," "producing too much will not be wanted," and so on, still refusing to produce in large quantities.

One day, the electrician Zhao Yonglin saw on the street that many Red Guards endured fatigue and cold, patiently queuing to buy Chairman Mao badges. Just as it was the turn of a Red Guard, the badges were sold out. The Red Guard cried in frustration. Zhao Yonglin saw this and felt a pang in his heart. With a heart full of excitement, he returned to the factory and connected with comrades Tian Zhihai, Ren Kezhong, Chong Xiuzhen, and others, determined to break through all obstacles and produce more Chairman Mao badges, letting more Chairman Mao badges meet with the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the world.

On August 18, 1966, Chairman Mao inspected the Red Guards for the first time at Tiananmen. The young guards presented red guard armbands to Chairman Mao, each with seven Chairman Mao badges, including those made by the workers of the Red Flag Badge Factory. The news reached the factory, and the workers could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" Subsequently, the Red Guards, wearing Chairman Mao badges, went to various parts of the country to ignite the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They wrote in letters to the workers, "Chairman Mao is always with us, we fear nothing!"

"Let's produce more, faster, and better golden Chairman Mao badges and send them to the people of the whole country and the people of the world!" This is the hope of millions of letter writers and the wish of all the workers in the factory.

Since the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Red Flag Badge Factory seized power from the clique of capitalists within the party, the number of Chairman Mao badges produced each month has greatly increased. They worked diligently, responsibly, and tenaciously overcame various difficulties to ensure that the brilliant image of the great leader Chairman Mao was as true to life as possible. From carving molds, stamping, polishing, to acid washing, painting, and drying, the revolutionary workers spent countless efforts. To produce more Chairman Mao badges, they enthusiastically supported nearly a hundred units with hundreds of sets of molds. In this way, tens of thousands of Chairman Mao badges flew from the Red Flag Badge Factory to all of China and to the world, inspiring hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to charge towards the old world.

    让毛主席的光辉普照全世界
    ——记北京红旗证章厂制作毛主席像章的故事
    北京红旗证章厂的革命职工，自从精心制作了我们伟大领袖毛主席的像章以后，不断收到来自全国各地和世界各地大量来信。每封来信都充满了他们的感激和殷切的期望。
    一群海军战士在来信中写道：“我们多么需要佩戴毛主席像章啊！戴上它，在茫茫大海里航行，永远不会迷失方向。戴上它，在大风大浪中能坚定地屹立在甲板上。戴上它，时刻精神焕发，斗志昂扬，浑身都是力量。戴上它，面对敌人，仇恨满胸膛。戴上它，想到台湾同胞和世界上三分之二受苦的阶级兄弟，英勇战斗在海洋上。”
    战斗在反美前线的南越人民解放军的一个战士，得到了一枚毛主席像章，双手捧着，抬头望北方，口里念着“毛主席，毛主席，毛主席万岁！”然后端端正正地佩戴在胸前，端起枪勇敢地投入了战斗。
    在反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚，人们无限热爱毛主席。有一次，中国的歌舞团演出后，群众纷纷向演员要毛主席像章。一转眼把像章都抢光了。人们小心翼翼地戴在胸前，两眼无限深情地看着毛主席像章，激动地叫一声“毛泽东！”
      在来比锡，有一位退休老工人，他无限热爱毛主席，希望得到一枚毛主席像章。后来他果然如愿以偿，他高兴极了。不管德修怎样严密监视，这位老工人一直把毛主席像章戴在胸前。他说：“胸前戴上毛主席像章，使我永远年青，更加有力量。”
      缅甸的一位青年来信说：“每当我看到别人胸前戴着毛主席像章时，就会羡慕地朝他胸前多看几次，……后来，我曾得到一枚，可是山芭的同学来信向我要。我知道山芭的人得到毛主席像章，比我们住在仰光的人困难得多。想了好久，给呢，还是不给？我只有这一枚呀！这时，我想到白求恩大夫毫不利己，专门利人的精神，就决定把仅有的一枚毛主席像章送给了他们。我渴望你们制作更多的毛主席像章。”
    难道这仅仅是信吗？不，这是千万颗无限热爱毛主席的心飞向北京。它表明了毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界，毛主席的伟大形象极大地鼓舞着全世界革命人民向一切敌人进行不屈的斗争。
    一封封激动人心的来信，使北京红旗证章厂革命职工受到了极大的鼓舞。
    然而，这个厂在制作毛主席像章中却经历了一场不平常的斗争。
    开始，红旗证章厂的工人，是怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情而制作像章的。最早想制作毛主席像章的是模具工田治海同志。他是一九六二年到这个厂当徒工的。这时，全国正掀起学习毛主席著作高潮。田治海对厂里的一种现象百思不解：为什么只生产“长命锁”等“四旧”产品，而不制作毛主席像章呢？他下定决心要闯出一条路来。
    要刻出毛主席像章的模具，必须会雕塑毛主席的像，他却没有学过雕塑，刻模具有困难。但是，困难难不倒热爱毛主席的工人，田治海从一九六五年八月开始，就把《人民日报》上刊登的毛主席像搜集在一起，仔细地观察、思考。他把自己节省下来的工资，买胶泥、石膏，练习雕塑。这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派知道后，认为这是“不务正业”，不给他练习时间。这也没有难倒田治海。他利用休息时间练习雕塑，常常雕塑到午夜一两点钟。头几十次，怎么也雕不象，怎么办呢？于是他坐下来学习毛主席著作。他认为要刻出毛主席的光辉形象，首先要把毛主席的光辉形象刻在心坎上。不知道度过了多少个不眠之夜，终于塑出了一个自己比较满意的毛主席半身像，他拿去找邻居征求意见，甚至找到一个三岁的小孩，问道：“这是谁？”孩子笑着说：“毛主席，毛主席。”田治海高兴了。为了塑造出毛主席像，他花费了整整八个月的时间。
    田治海在许多老工人的帮助下，雕刻出了第一套毛主席像章模具，要求厂的领导安排制作毛主席像章，厂里的领导不得不答应每月制作三十万枚毛主席像章。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始了！毛主席著作供不应求，毛主席像章也供不应求。红旗证章厂的革命职工，给厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派贴出了大字报，揭露了他们推行修正主义路线的罪行，声讨他们只生产“长命百岁”、“三仙”、“麒麟”锁，而拒绝制作毛主席像章的罪恶勾当。当时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派借口“没订户，计划不好安排”，“生产多了没有人要”等等，仍然拒绝大量制作。
    一天，电工赵永林在街上看到许多红卫兵小将不怕疲劳，不怕寒冷，耐心地排队购买毛主席像章。刚好挨到一个红卫兵小将时，像章却卖完了。这个红卫兵急得直哭。赵永林看到这件事，心象针扎一样难过。他满怀激动的心情回到工厂，串连了田治海、任克忠、崇秀珍等同志，决心冲破一切障碍，多制作毛主席像章，让更多的毛主席像章与全国人民和全世界革命人民见面。
    一九六六年八月十八日，毛主席在天安门第一次检阅红卫兵。小将们向毛主席献红卫兵袖章，上面别有七枚毛主席像章，其中就有红旗证章厂工人们的心血。消息传到工厂以后，工人们情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”随后，红卫兵小将们戴着毛主席像章，走向全国各地去点燃无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。他们在写给工人的信上说：“毛主席时刻和我们在一起，我们什么也不怕！”
      “要更多地更快地更好地把金光闪闪的毛主席像章，送到全中国人民和全世界人民胸前！”这是千万个来信者的期望，也是全厂职工的心愿。
    自从红旗证章厂无产阶级革命派夺了厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，每月制作的毛主席像章大大地增长。他们兢兢业业、认真负责，顽强地克服各种困难，努力保证让伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象逼真又逼真。从刻模、冲压、打光，到酸洗、描漆、烘干，革命职工不知花费了多少心血。为了制作更多的毛主席像章，他们热情地支援了近百个单位数百套模具。就这样，成千成万枚的毛主席像章，从红旗证章厂飞到全中国，飞向全世界，鼓舞着亿万革命人民向着旧世界去冲锋陷阵。
