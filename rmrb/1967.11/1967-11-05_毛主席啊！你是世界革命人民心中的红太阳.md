The red sun shines over the world, and the spring thunder roars across the land. Under the command of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping across the globe like a mighty east wind, thunderous and resounding, shaking the entire world. Revolutionary people all over the world praise and cheer, “Mao Zedong is the dawn of the new era, Mao Zedong is the hope of humanity, Mao Zedong is the banner of victory, Mao Zedong is the brightest red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world.” The world’s people follow you, from victory to victory.

Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, we will carry them out a million times!

Just after National Day, one morning, a crowd of foreign friends gathered at the entrance of the hotel’s postal service. Each of them held a copy of the People’s Daily, discussing Vice Chairman Lin’s speech at the celebration of the 18th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. As we approached, a New Zealand friend called out to us, “Soldiers, (pointing to Vice Chairman Lin’s speech) Vice Chairman Lin conveyed the latest instructions from the world’s highest commander, Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen: ‘Fight selfishness, criticize revisionism.’ The revolutionary people of New Zealand firmly support this and will carry it out a million times!”

He excitedly said, “Living in great China, I feel extremely fortunate. I can hear the voice of Mao Zedong and see Chairman Mao’s latest instructions firsthand. I feel incredibly proud and honored; this is the greatest happiness for the people of New Zealand.”

After a pause, he clenched his teeth, tightened his fists, and angrily denounced the Chinese Khrushchev, saying, “I came to China to study Mao Zedong Thought and return home to make a revolution. But the Chinese Khrushchev told us to reflect in seclusion and practice self-cultivation behind closed doors, not allowing us to face the wind and rain or see the world. I will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao’s great call, go to the countryside, go to the fiery class struggle, better use and master Mao Zedong Thought. Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and in the battle of ‘fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism,’ temper and transform myself to become a selfless person.”

The next day, this foreign friend and several other experts went to work in the suburbs of Beijing.

Red Sun Shines Over the Land, Red Hearts Turn to the Sun

One day, the radio broadcast the lively song “The East Is Red.” Two Japanese friends came out of the hotel, carefully taking out three shiny gold Mao badges wrapped in red silk from their pockets. They proudly shared with us their excitement after visiting Yan’an. One friend said, “With boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and boundless reverence for Mao Zedong Thought, carrying the revolutionary friendship of the Japanese people, we flew over mountains and seas to visit the holy land of the Chinese revolution—Yan’an. When I entered Chairman Mao’s former office, it was as if I were in the palace of the sun, feeling incredibly warm and bright! This is the greatest happiness of my life. I felt as if I had seen Chairman Mao personally leading the revolution in Yan’an, with a red sun shining over the land, commanding millions of brave soldiers, conquering all enemies in the north and south. Under the shadow of the Pagoda Mountain in Yan’an, Chairman Mao pointed the way for the world revolution. The revolutionary fire of Yan’an spread across China, and the revolutionary storm of Yan’an shook the world. Chairman Mao is our great helmsman, the most beloved leader of all the people of the world. The path of Mao Zedong is the path to the victory of the world revolution. Following the path of Mao Zedong, communism will surely come.”

She raised her hands and jumped up, shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!!!” She sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life and long life!

Then, she handed over the three Mao badges with both hands and said, “These three Mao badges were specially brought back from our visit to Yan’an. They symbolize the boundless love of the Japanese people and all the people of the world for Chairman Mao and their boundless reverence for Mao Zedong Thought. Wear them and serve the Chinese people and all the people of the world wholeheartedly, fight for the complete liberation of the three-fifths of the suffering people in the world for life.”

The Heartfelt Expectations of Friends from Five Continents

Our guard company received a gift wrapped in red silk from friends from more than thirty countries on five continents. On the red silk, two lines of golden characters were written in neat Chinese: “The heartfelt expectations of friends from five continents: Defend Chairman Mao to the death.” As the news spread, all the comrades in the company rushed over. The political instructor opened it to find more than ten color portraits of Chairman Mao and more than forty different styles of Mao badges shining brightly. Inside were more than thirty letters, written in the most beautiful languages and most sincere emotions, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone looked on, their hearts stirred with excitement, tears of joy streaming down their faces, shouting “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!!!” They sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life and long life!

In the letters, a Brazilian friend wrote, “Dear comrades of the People’s Liberation Army, Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong is the outstanding leader of the proletariat, Mao Zedong is the most brilliant flag bearer of the international communist movement, Mao Zedong is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. With Mao Zedong, the revolution will be victorious, with Mao Zedong, the world will be red! We love Mao Zedong the most, you must defend the great helmsman Mao Zedong to the death.” A British friend wrote, “The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism in the world today, it is the lifeblood of the revolutionary people of the world. It is the invincible spiritual atomic bomb to defeat American imperialism, it is the powerful ideological weapon to overcome revisionism. The people of the world have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, the fate of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is doomed to complete failure. The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought must fly over the entire world!”

In the collective letter from friends on five continents, it was written, “The People’s Liberation Army of China is the contemporary Lenin-Mao Zedong’s personally created, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, unparalleled, invincible new-type people’s army in the world. We friends from five continents sincerely hope that you will defend Chairman Mao to the death.”

Unlimited Happiness in One Sentence: Long Live Chairman Mao!

In the hotel, there was a friend from an Arab country. When he heard that Chairman Mao would receive them on National Day at Tiananmen, he was overjoyed! He immediately rushed back to the office, found the interpreter, and insisted on learning to shout “Long live Chairman Mao!” in Chinese. He said, “I can see the great commander, the brightest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, whom I think of every year, every month, and every day. This is the greatest happiness of my life, a great joy for my country’s people. On Tiananmen, I must let Chairman Mao hear the shouts of the Arab people in Chinese, ‘Long live Chairman Mao!’”

That night, he learned word by word, shouted phrase by phrase, until late into the night. On the morning of October 1, this friend came to Tiananmen. Before the car stopped, he was the first to jump out, quickly running to stand in front of Chairman Mao’s giant color portrait. Looking up at Chairman Mao, his heart surged. He shouted word by word: Mao—Zhu—Xi—Wan—Sui! Mao—Zhu—Xi—Wan—Sui! Expressing the boundless love of the Arab people for Chairman Mao and the loudest voice in the hearts of all the people of the world. The revolutionary masses and friends from five continents on the scene joined in the shout.

    毛主席啊！你是世界革命人民心中的红太阳
    红日照寰宇，春雷动大地。我国无产阶级文化大革命在伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的指挥下，如浩荡东风，轰轰雷鸣，震荡全世界。全世界革命人民声声赞颂，尽情欢呼：“毛泽东是新时代的曙光，毛泽东是人类的希望，毛泽东是胜利的旗帜，毛泽东是全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。”世界人民跟着您，从胜利走向胜利。
    毛主席的最新指示，一万个照办！
    国庆刚过，一天上午，宾馆邮电所门口挤满了一群外国朋友，他们每人手里拿着一份《人民日报》，正在谈论着林副主席在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的讲话。我们刚走到跟前，一位新西兰朋友喊住我们：“解放军同志，（边说边指着林副主席的讲话）林副主席在天安门上传达了世界人民最高统帅毛主席的最新指示，‘要斗私，批修。’我们新西兰革命人民坚决拥护，一万个照办！”
    他兴奋地说：“我生活在伟大的中国，深感到非常幸福。我能听到毛泽东的声音，优先看到毛主席的最新指示。我感到无比骄傲和自豪，这是新西兰人民的最大幸福。”
    停了一会，他咬着牙齿，握紧拳头，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫，他说：“我来到中国是为了学习毛泽东思想回国闹革命的。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫，叫我们闭门思过，关门修养，不让我们去经风雨，见世面。我要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村去，到火热的阶级斗争中去，更好地运用和掌握毛泽东思想。向贫下中农学习，在‘斗私，批修’的战斗中，认真地锻炼改造自己，做一个无私的人。”
    第二天，这位外国朋友和其他几位专家就到北京郊区劳动去了。
                 红日照大地　红心向太阳
    一天，喇叭里传来了响亮的《东方红》歌曲声，两位日本朋友兴高采烈地从宾馆走出来，小心地从衣袋里掏出用红绸包着的三枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章，自豪地向我们倾诉她们参观了延安后激动的心情。一位朋友说：“我们怀着对毛泽东主席的无限热爱和对毛泽东思想无限敬仰的心情，带着日本人民的革命友谊，飞越千山万水，渡过大海汪洋，参观了中国革命圣地——延安。当我走进毛主席当年的办公室，犹如置身在太阳宫一样，感到无比温暖，无比明亮！这是我一生最大的幸福。我好象亲眼看到了毛主席当年在延安高举革命大旗，一轮红日普照大地，指挥百万雄兵，南征北战全无敌。宝塔山下延安城，毛主席为世界革命指前程，延安革命之火燃遍全中国，延安革命风暴震撼全世界。毛主席是我们伟大的舵手，是全世界人民最敬爱的领袖。毛泽东的道路是世界革命胜利的道路。走毛泽东的道路，共产主义一定要到来。”
    说着，她举起双手，跳起来高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！衷心敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！”
    随后，她把三枚毛主席像章双手赠送给我们并且说：“这三枚毛主席像章是我们参观延安时，特地带回来的。这标志着日本人民和全世界人民无限热爱毛主席，无限敬仰毛泽东思想的红心。你们戴上它，要全心全意为中国人民和全世界人民服务，为彻底解放世界上三分之二的受苦人民战斗终身。”
                    五大洲朋友的殷切期望
    我们警卫连收到了来自五大洲三十多个国家的外国朋友送来的一份用红绸包好的礼物。红绸上用中文端端正正写着两行金光闪闪的大字：“五大洲朋友的殷切期望：誓死保卫毛主席。”喜讯一传开，全连同志不约而同地涌了上来。指导员打开一看，十多张毛主席的彩色画像和四十多枚各式各样的毛主席像章闪闪发光。包里装着三十多封信，这些信用世界上最美好的语言、最真挚的感情，倾诉对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限信仰。大家看着，激动的心不能平息，含着幸福的热泪，一次又一次地高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！
    来信中，一位巴西朋友说：“亲爱的解放军同志们，毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东是无产阶级最杰出的领袖，毛泽东是国际共产主义运动最英明的旗手，毛泽东是世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。有了毛泽东，革命就胜利，有了毛泽东，世界红彤彤！我们最爱毛泽东，你们要誓死保卫伟大的舵手毛泽东。”一位英国朋友说：“光焰无际的毛泽东思想是当今世界上最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是世界革命人民的命根子。是打败美帝国主义威力无穷的精神原子弹，是战胜修正主义的强大思想武器。世界人民掌握了毛泽东思想，帝、修、反的命运注定要彻底完蛋。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗一定要飘扬全世界！”
    五大洲朋友的集体来信中写道：“中国人民解放军是当代列宁——毛泽东亲手缔造的，是毛泽东思想哺育起来的举世无双的无敌于天下的新型人民军队。我们五大洲朋友殷切期望你们誓死保卫毛主席。”
              无限幸福化成一句话：毛主席万岁！
    宾馆里有一位阿拉伯国家的朋友，听到毛主席要在国庆节在天安门城楼上接见他们。他高兴极了！立即跑回办公室，找到了翻译，一定要翻译教会他用中国话高呼毛主席万岁！他说：我能够见到年年想、月月思、日日盼的当代最了不起的伟大统帅，世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，这是我一生最大的幸福，是我国人民天大的喜事。在天安门城楼上我一定要让毛主席他老人家听到我们阿拉伯人民用中国话高呼毛主席万岁的欢呼声。
    晚上，他一字一字地学，一遍一遍地呼，一直学到深夜。十月一日清晨，这位朋友来到天安门，车子还没停稳，他第一个跳下汽车，飞快地跑到毛主席巨幅彩色画像前站立，两眼仰望着毛主席，心潮翻涌。他一字一字地高呼着：毛—主—席—万—岁！毛—主—席—万—岁！呼出了阿拉伯人民对毛主席的无限热爱，呼出了全世界人民心里最响亮的声音。在场的革命群众和五大洲朋友一起高呼起来。
