The spokesman for the Communist Party of Thailand has called on the people to smash the U.S.-Thanom-Praphat clique's sham election fraud.

The armed struggle led by the Thai Communists has become the hope of the entire nation.

Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: According to the "Voice of the Thai People" radio broadcast, the spokesman for the Communist Party of Thailand recently issued a statement titled "Resolutely Wage People's War to Smash the U.S.-Thanom-Praphat Clique's Political Fraud." The statement exposes the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique's plan to soon issue a fake constitution and hold fake elections to deceive the people. The statement emphasizes that armed struggle is the only way for the Thai people to expel U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, and achieve true national independence and democracy.

The statement says: At a time when the Thanom-Praphat puppet clique is intensifying the sale of the country to serve U.S. imperialism, intensifying the suppression, massacre, and arrest of patriotic and democratic people, plunging the entire nation into unprecedented misery, they are putting on a show of issuing a fake constitution and holding fake elections. This is actually a performance of a grand political fraud jointly planned by U.S. imperialism, the Thanom-Praphat puppet clique, and revisionist traitors. Their goal is to use this grand political fraud to split and destroy the revolutionary ranks, extinguish the flames of people's armed struggle, and maintain their reactionary rule to continue their treacherous, fascist dictatorship, and harm the country and its people.

The statement says: Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, all patriotic and democratic people have resolutely risen up and consistently fought against U.S. imperialism's aggression and the Thanom-Praphat gang's betrayal of national independence and destruction of people's freedoms. The Thanom-Praphat gang not only suppressed and arrested patriotic and democratic people but also increasingly exposed their treacherous and reactionary nature. They have willingly become loyal servants of U.S. imperialism. They have turned our beloved country into a new type of colony of U.S. imperialism. Our territory has become an important strategic base for U.S. imperialism to wage wars of aggression. The Thanom-Praphat clique has also allowed the U.S. to station B-52 bombers in Thailand, using our air bases to launch savage bombings against Vietnam and Laos, and sending Thai troops to participate in the war of aggression in South Vietnam and to suppress the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Lao people. Even worse, they have participated in the U.S. strategic plan to encircle and threaten the People's Republic of China. The traitor Thanom-Praphat clique has also allowed tens of thousands of American bandit soldiers to come to Thailand to destroy our national honor, run amok, and arbitrarily bully and harm the Thai people. They have colluded to plunder and suck the blood of the people, causing the people to suffer greatly from hunger and poverty. Therefore, the movement to oppose the crimes of the U.S.-Thanom gang has spread throughout the country.

The statement says: Over the past few years, the lessons bought with the blood and resolute struggle of the people have educated our people, organizing them to use revolutionary and patriotic armed forces to resist and strike back against the armed traitors of the U.S.-Thanom gang. This has made the people see that armed struggle is the only way to expel U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat clique, and achieve true national independence and democracy, and improve the people's lives.

The statement says: Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed struggle has received the enthusiastic support of the people. The flames of armed struggle that started in the northeast have now spread to the plains and forests of the south, central, and northern regions of the entire country. The armed struggle has inspired the entire nation and has become the hope of the entire nation.

The statement points out: The development of people's armed struggle has made the U.S.-Thanom gang increasingly panicked. They have formulated various plans and increased their forces to carry out increasingly savage suppression. The patriotic armed forces not only can effectively resist but also have dealt blow after blow to the U.S.-Thanom gang, causing them to suffer losses. The patriotic armed forces have not only not been destroyed but have instead grown stronger and more resilient. Therefore, the U.S.-Thanom clique has desperately resorted to the aforementioned political fraud to try to deceive the people and make the people fall for their tricks to engage in peaceful struggle and parliamentary struggle. The so-called "constitution," "political parties," and "elections" they are promoting are all to deceive the people, hoping to create chaos and division within the revolutionary ranks and attempting to isolate and even make the patriotic armed forces surrender and surrender to them. However, the U.S.-Thanom gang's despicable plot will not deceive the people. The people have learned from their own experiences that the path of peaceful struggle and parliamentary struggle cannot solve the problems of the nation and the people. It can only become a tool to serve the fraud of the U.S.-Thanom gang.

The statement says: The Communist Party of Thailand and the patriotic armed forces of Thailand under the party's leadership have resolved to unite with all patriotic and democratic people to resolutely carry out the line of armed struggle and persist in waging people's war. No matter how savage and brutal the methods the U.S.-Thanom clique uses to suppress, or how they alternate between political fraud and armed suppression, they will not gain anything. Instead, they will only further expose their faces of aggression and treachery. Our party and all patriotic and democratic forces will launch a fierce counterattack against the U.S.-Thanom clique and smash all their plots and tricks.

The statement points out: The path of people's armed struggle is a bright and promising road. Our patriotic and democratic struggle is progressive and just. The patriotic people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the world are on our side and support us. The difficulties and twists we currently face are only temporary. As long as we are determined, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties, we will gradually achieve victory. The U.S.-Thanom gang, due to their aggressive and treacherous actions being reactionary and unjust, will inevitably face opposition from people both domestically and internationally. Their doom is undoubted.

The statement calls on the Thai people to denounce the treacherous and oppressive actions of the Thanom-Praphat clique, resolutely expose and oppose their political fraud, strongly oppose their fake democracy and sham elections, actively participate in, support, or cooperate with the armed struggle, to expel U.S. imperialism and overthrow the Thanom-Praphat clique, to establish a united government that implements policies of independence and democracy, and to build our beloved country into a prosperous and progressive nation!

The statement concludes with the slogan: "U.S. imperialism and the Thanom traitorous gang must perish! The Thai people will surely triumph!"

    泰国共产党发言人号召人民起来粉碎美帝—他侬集团的伪选骗局
    展开武装斗争驱逐美帝推翻卖国集团
    泰共领导的武装斗争已成为全国人民的希望
    新华社十八日讯　据“泰国人民之声”电台广播：泰国共产党发言人最近发表题为《坚决进行人民战争，粉碎美帝—他侬集团的政治大骗局》的声明。声明揭露他侬—巴博卖国集团打算最近颁布伪宪法和举行伪选举来欺骗人民。声明强调指出，武装斗争才是泰国人民驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团和争取国家的真正独立民主的唯一出路。
    声明说：正当他侬—巴博傀儡集团加紧出卖国家，为美帝国主义效劳，加紧镇压、屠杀和逮捕爱国爱民主的人民，使全国人民陷于从来没有过的水深火热的痛苦中的时候，它们作出一种姿态，表示将于最近颁布伪宪法和举行伪选举。这实际上就是美帝国主义、他侬—巴博傀儡集团和修正主义叛徒共同策划的政治大骗局的一场表演。它们的目的在于利用这场政治大骗局来分裂和破坏革命的队伍，扑灭人民武装斗争的烈火，以保持其反动统治和继续从事卖国、法西斯独裁、祸国殃民的勾当。
    声明说：几年来，在泰国共产党的领导下，一切爱国爱民主的人民，已经坚决地起来并且始终坚持反对美帝国主义的侵略，反对他侬—巴博匪帮出卖民族独立和破坏人民的自由权利。他侬—巴博匪帮不仅镇压和逮捕了反对他们的爱国爱民主的人民，还越来越明显和越严重地暴露出它们卖国反动的本性。它们已经甘心充当美帝国主义忠实的奴才。它们使我们亲爱的国家完全沦为美帝国主义的新型殖民地。我们的国土已经变成美帝国主义进行侵略战争的重要战略基地。他侬—巴博集团还让美国把Ｂ—52轰炸机进驻泰国，使用在我国的空军基地对越南和老挝进行野蛮的轰炸，同时还派遣泰国军队到越南南方参加侵略战争，并且参加镇压老挝人民的抗美救国斗争。更甚的是，它们还参加了美国对中华人民共和国进行包围和威胁的战略计划。卖国贼他侬—巴博集团还让数万名美国强盗兵到泰国来毁坏我民族的荣誉，横行霸道，任意欺凌和残害泰国人民。它们狼狈为奸，进行巧取豪夺，吮吸人民的血，使人民遭到极大的痛苦、饥饿和贫困。因此，反对美帝—他侬匪帮罪行的运动，便在全国广泛地展开。
    声明说：几年来，人民用鲜血和坚决顽强的斗争换来的教训，教育了我们的人民，使他们组织起来，用革命的和爱国的武装去反抗和打击美帝—他侬匪帮反动卖国的武装。这就使人民看到：武装斗争是驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博集团的唯一出路，是使国家取得真正的独立民主，使人民的生活得到改善的唯一出路。
    声明说：两年来，在泰国共产党领导下的武装斗争，受到人民热烈的支持。在东北部燃起的武装斗争的烈火，现在已经蔓延到包括南部、中部和北部的全国平原和山林地区。武装斗争鼓舞着全国人民，并已成为全国人民的希望。
    声明指出：人民武装斗争的发展，使美帝—他侬匪帮越来越惊慌。它们制定了各种计划并且增加兵力进行越来越疯狂的镇压。爱国人民武装不仅能够进行有效的抵抗，并且给美帝—他侬匪帮以一次又一次的打击，使它们遭到损失。爱国人民武装不但没有被消灭，相反地，力量却越来越壮大和坚强起来。因此，美帝—他侬集团才竭力转而采取上述政治大骗局，以图欺骗人民，使人民受其迷惑去进行和平斗争和议会斗争。他们搞的所谓“宪法”、“政党”和“选举”这些东西，是为了欺骗人民的，希望能在革命队伍内部制造混乱和分裂，并且企图使爱国人民武装孤立，甚至放弃武装斗争并向他们投降。但是，美帝—他侬匪帮这一卑劣阴谋，是欺骗不了人民的。人民从自己的切身经验中体会到，和平斗争和议会斗争道路是不能解决国家和人民的问题的。它只能成为替美帝—他侬匪帮的骗局效劳的工具。
    声明说：泰国共产党和在党领导下的泰国爱国人民武装，已经下定决心同全体爱国爱民主的人民联合起来，坚决实行武装斗争的路线，并且将坚持进行人民战争。不论美帝—他侬集团将采取怎样野蛮残暴的手段进行镇压，也不管它们把政治骗局和武装镇压怎样地交替使用，它们是决捞不到什么东西的，相反地，只能更加暴露它们的侵略和卖国反动的面目。我们党和全体爱国爱民主的力量，将会对美帝—他侬集团进行猛烈的反击，并将粉碎它们的一切阴谋诡计。
    声明指出：人民武装斗争的道路，是一条前途光明灿烂的道路。我们的爱国爱民主的斗争，是进步的和正义的斗争。全国爱国人民和全世界革命人民是站在我们一边和支持我们的。我们目前遭到的困难和曲折，只是暂时的。只要我们下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，就会逐步地争取胜利。而美帝—他侬匪帮，由于它们的侵略和卖国行径是反动的和非正义的，所以遭到国内外人民的反对。它们将遭到毁灭是毫无疑问的。
    声明号召泰国人民，声讨他侬—巴博集团的卖国和压迫行为，坚决揭露和反对它们的政治大骗局，强烈反对它们的假民主和伪选举，积极参加、支持或配合武装斗争，为驱逐美帝国主义和推翻他侬—巴博集团，为建立一个实行独立、民主政策的联合政府，为把我们亲爱的国家建设得繁荣进步而斗争！
    声明最后高呼：“美帝国主义和他侬卖国匪帮集团必亡！”“泰国人民必胜！”
