	Correctly Treating Oneself and the Masses
	Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Municipal Transportation Group Leader, Former Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Committee's Municipal Transportation Political Department, Huang Tao

	In the past, I always thought of myself as a good or relatively good cadre. During the movement, the masses said I had taken the wrong side, criticizing me for executing a bourgeois reactionary line. At that time, I couldn't understand it. I thought that this time I had made a serious mistake because I had become the deputy director of the old Municipal Committee's Municipal Transportation Political Department, and in the past two years, I had also acted as the number one leader. If I hadn't become such a big "official," I wouldn't have made such a big mistake. I also thought that if I were still in the factory, if I were still in the army and hadn't been transferred, I wouldn't have ended up like this.

	I also felt that I had "no merit, but at least some hard work," that I had been "diligent and active in working for the Party."

	Through continuous study of Chairman Mao's works and through the continuous criticism and struggle of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary factions, I gradually became aware. Originally, I had the burden of being an "old cadre" in my mind, and as my "seniority" increased, my thoughts also became more and more outdated. I was "living off old merits" and not striving to "achieve new merits." Especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses. For whom was I working so hard? Isn't this a matter of great principle? Just this one point, isn't it enough to deeply touch my soul?

	I feel that only by correctly treating myself and my mistakes can I correctly treat the masses and correctly treat the masses' criticism and struggle.

	Do I accept the masses' exposure, criticism, and struggle? This is also a key issue. In the past, I criticized others but not myself. Now, once the masses touch my soul, I can't take it. But what should I do? Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must put politics in command and go among the masses." So, I braced myself and went among the masses. I told the revolutionary factions all the problems I couldn't understand and asked them to help me. After comrades pointed out and enlightened me, some problems were resolved. In the past, I always pointed fingers and educated others; this time, when I was criticized, I couldn't take it, and thoughts like "I'm finished anyway," "fight, criticize, and leave" emerged. The path of "leaving" is not feasible. The only correct attitude should be "fight, criticize, and change," it can only be "change." "Fight, criticize, and leave" essentially still resists the masses' criticism and struggle, creating a distance in thoughts and emotions. This is also a distance from the revolution, a distance from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. My mistakes are already very serious, and if I further distance myself from the masses, what kind of consequences will that produce?

	In countless interactions with the masses, I increasingly felt that the masses are reasonable and clear about right and wrong. The fearless revolutionary spirit they showed during the Cultural Revolution is something I should learn from. It is they who have established immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	If we talk about personal gains and losses, through this Cultural Revolution, I lost the spiritual shackle of "Cultivation" that had long been weighing me down, and I gained the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong; I lost the slavish mentality of yes-manism, and I gained the fighting spirit of the proletarian party nature; I lost the muddy waters in my mind, and I gained a revolutionary political outlook. In the end, I lost the "self," and I gained the "public." Thinking of these, what is there to be dissatisfied with?

	I truly understood Chairman Mao's teaching: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this point means not obtaining even the most basic knowledge." I must forever learn from the masses and forever be a small student of the masses.

### 正确对待自己　正确对待群众

    正确对待自己　正确对待群众
    上海市革命委员会市政交通组领导成员原上海市委市政交通政治部副主任  黄涛
    过去，我一向以为自己是一个好的或比较好的干部。运动中，群众说我站错了队，批判我执行了资产阶级反动路线。我当时想不通。我以为这次犯了严重错误，是因为当上了旧市委市政交通政治部的副主任，而且，这两年又代理过第一把手。如果不是当了这么大的“官”，就不会犯这么大的错误。又想，如果我还在工厂，如果我还在部队没转业，更不致如此了。
    我还感到自己“没有功劳，也有苦劳”，是为党“勤勤恳恳、积极工作”的。
    经过不断学习毛主席著作，又经过革命派和革命群众的不断批判和斗争，才使我逐步清醒过来。原来我思想上背着“老干部”的包袱，并且随着“资格”的变“老”，自己的思想也在一天天地变“老”。我是在“吃老本”，而不再努力“立新功”。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，我忠实执行了资产阶级反动路线，对革命群众实行了资产阶级专政，这又是在为哪个司令部卖力呢？这难道不是“大节”吗？就这一条，不就已经足够狠触自己的灵魂了吗！
    我觉得，只有正确对待自己，正确对待自己的错误，才能正确对待群众、正确对待群众的批判和斗争。
    对群众的揭发、批判和斗争服气不服气？这同样是一个关键问题。过去，自己整人不整己。现在群众一旦触及了自己的灵魂，就受不了。可是怎么办呢？毛主席教导说：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去”。于是我硬着头皮到群众中去。我把自己想不通的问题全盘告诉了革命派，请他们帮助。经同志们指点、开导，有的问题就想通了。过去，我一贯指手划脚，教育别人；这回自己受了批判，就经受不起了，什么“反正不行了”，“斗批走”之类的思想都冒出来了。“走”，这条路是行不通的。唯一正确的态度，应该是“斗批改”，只能是“改”。“斗批走”，实质上还是对群众的批判、斗争有抵触，思想感情上有距离。这也就是对革命有距离，对毛主席的革命路线有距离。我的错误已十分严重，再把自己同群众的距离拉开，又将产生一种什么样的后果呢？
    我在多少次同群众接触中，越来越感到群众是通情达理、是非分明的。他们在文化大革命中所表现出来的大无畏革命精神，就很值得我学习。正是他们，在无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了不朽的功勋！
    如果要论个人的得失，通过这场文化大革命，我失去的是《修养》这个长期压在我身上的精神枷锁，得到的是光焰无际的毛泽东思想；失去的是唯唯诺诺的奴隶主义，得到的是战斗的无产阶级党性；失去的是自己思想上的污泥浊水，得到的是革命的政治思想面貌。归根到底，失去的是“私”字，得到的是“公”字。想到这些，还有什么不服气的？
    我真正体会到了毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我一定要永远向群众学习，永远做群众的小学生。
