Our red diplomats, led by Charge d'Affaires Huang Wensheng of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and 20 embassy staff, departed Jakarta on a special plane sent by our country on November 31, accompanied by Pei Mornong, Deputy Director of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. They were warmly seen off by diplomatic envoys from various friendly countries.

After the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime subjected our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia to a series of persecutions and unreasonably demanded that the Chinese government withdraw all embassy and consulate personnel, the Chinese government was forced to temporarily close the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in Indonesia and withdraw all embassy personnel.

Our red diplomats, upon leaving Jakarta, were seen off at the airport by envoys from friendly countries including the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Romania, Cuba, Afghanistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pakistan, and Cambodia, as well as representatives from the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in Jakarta.

On the morning of November 31, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia raised the solemn Five-Star Red Flag as usual. During the closing ceremony of the embassy, all staff recited Chairman Mao's quotations:

"The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly triumph, whether sooner or later..."

Our red diplomats, on their way from the embassy to the Jakarta airport in cars provided by envoys from various friendly countries in Indonesia, encountered a state of panic by the Indonesian reactionary government. Military police were stationed everywhere, and security was tight, as if facing a major enemy. Armored military vehicles and motorcycles tightly escorted them from the front and rear. The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia cannot be destroyed by anyone. Along the way, Indonesian people and patriotic overseas Chinese, filled with sentiments of farewell and sympathy for our red diplomats, waved and greeted them. Some overseas Chinese had tears in their eyes and waved repeatedly to say goodbye.

Our red diplomats, who had long been fighting and were besieged by the Indonesian reactionary government for a month, arrived at the airport. Seeing the representatives, medical staff, and the special plane crew sent by our country to welcome them, and the red slogan "The Sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought Shines All Over the World" written on the plane, they were deeply moved and tears welled up in their eyes. They warmly embraced the welcoming comrades and together shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"

Deputy Director Pei Mornong of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Chinese Foreign Ministry delivered a speech at the airport. He expressed heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to the envoys from various countries for their concern and assistance to the injured personnel of our embassy during the armed attack and siege, and for coming to see off our embassy personnel.

Before boarding the plane, our red diplomats held high the portrait of Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Five-Star Red Flag of our great motherland, waving the red-bound "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and bidding farewell to the envoys from various countries and to the Indonesian people and patriotic overseas Chinese who were isolated outside the airport. Our red diplomats boarded the special plane at 12:15 Beijing time and left the disaster-stricken archipelago under the rule of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime.

On the eve of our red diplomats' departure from Jakarta, on October 30, they held a farewell reception. Envoys and diplomats from 15 countries, including the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in Jakarta, Romania, Cuba, Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Cambodia, Ceylon, the United Arab Republic, Poland, Iraq, Algeria, Switzerland, and France, attended the reception.

Due to the unreasonable obstruction by the Indonesian reactionary government, Charge d'Affaires Huang Wensheng of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia could not return from the hospital to participate in the reception.

At the reception, Consul General Shi Jinkang of the Chinese Consulate in Jakarta exposed the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary government in its long-term anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, deliberately sabotaging the relations between China and Indonesia. After the reception, envoys from various countries visited the scene of the embassy, which had been attacked and damaged by Indonesian fascist thugs and reactionary military police. The envoys expressed great indignation at the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government. The envoys also took away the English version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao Zedong badges placed at the reception.

    高举伟大领袖毛主席画像和五星红旗
    我红色外交战士离雅加达回国
    印尼人民和爱国华侨向我外交战士挥手致意依依惜别　各友好国家使节热情欢送
    新华社三十一日讯　雅加达消息：我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办黄文胜和使领馆全体人员二十人，在专程前往迎接他们的我国外交部第一亚洲司副司长裴默农陪同下，三十一日乘坐我国派去的专机离开雅加达回国，受到各国友好使节的热烈欢送。
    在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权对我驻印尼外交人员进行一系列的迫害，并无理要求中国政府撤回使领馆全部人员后，我国政府不得不暂时关闭中国驻印尼大使馆和领事馆并撤回使领馆全部人员。
    我红色外交人员在离开雅加达时，到机场送行的有：越南民主共和国、罗马尼亚、古巴、阿富汗、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、巴基斯坦、柬埔寨等兄弟国家和友好国家的使节以及越南南方民族解放阵线驻雅加达代表。
    我驻印尼大使馆三十一日早晨五时许，照常升起庄严的五星红旗。在闭馆并离开使馆时，举行了降旗仪式，全体同志高声朗读毛主席语录：
    社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。……
    我红色外交战士在乘坐各友好国家驻印尼使节提供的汽车，从大使馆到雅加达飞机场的道路上，印尼反动政府恐慌万状，到处军警林立，戒备森严，如临大敌，满载武装军警的大卡车和摩托车紧紧前导后随。中国和印尼两国人民的战斗友谊是任何人破坏不了的。沿途印尼人民和爱国华侨，满怀着对我红色外交战士惜别和同情的心情，挥手致意，有的华侨眼里含着泪水，频频招手告别。
    长期坚持斗争并被印尼反动政府武装袭击、围困达一个月之久的我红色外交战士来到飞机场，看到祖国政府派来的专程前来迎接他们的代表、医务护理人员以及专机组人员，看到机身上用红字书写的“毛泽东思想的阳光普照全世界”的鲜红标语以后，非常激动，热泪盈眶。他们同前来迎接的亲人热烈拥抱，共同高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    我国外交部第一亚洲司副司长裴默农，在机场发表了讲话。他代表我国外交部向各国使节在我大使馆遭到武装袭击和围困期间，对我使馆全体负伤人员所给予的关怀和帮助表示衷心感谢，并对他们前来为我使领馆人员送行表示感谢。
    我红色外交战士在上飞机前，高举伟大领袖毛主席画像和伟大祖国五星红旗，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向前来送行的各国使节告别，向被隔离在机场外面的印尼人民和爱国华侨告别。我红色外交战士于北京时间十二时十五分登上专机，离开了在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权统治下的灾难深重的千岛之国。
    我红色外交战士离开雅加达前夕，于十月三十日举行了告别招待会。越南民主共和国临时代办以及使馆全体人员、越南南方民族解放阵线驻雅加达代表、罗马尼亚、古巴、阿富汗、叙利亚、巴基斯坦、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、柬埔寨、锡兰、阿联、波兰、伊拉克、阿尔及利亚、瑞士、法国等十五个国家的使节和外交官出席了招待会。
    由于印尼反动政府的无理刁难，我驻印尼大使馆临时代办黄文胜不能从医院返回使馆参加招待会。
    在招待会上，我驻雅加达代总领事师晋侃在讲话中揭露了印尼反动政府长期反华排华、蓄意破坏中国和印尼两国关系的滔天罪行。招待会后，各国使节观看了被印尼法西斯暴徒和反动军警武装袭击，遭到破坏的大使馆现场。各国使节对印尼反动政府的法西斯暴行表示极大的愤慨。各国使节还带走了陈放在招待会上的英文版《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。
