Carry Out People's War to Annihilate U.S.-Thai Reactionaries

Thai People's Armed Forces Kill Over a Thousand Enemies in Two Years

Currently, the people's armed forces led by the Thai Communist Party are carrying out armed struggle in 27 provinces.

Xinhua News Agency reports from Bangkok: According to the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station's broadcast on October 25, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the flames of the Thai people's armed struggle are burning more fiercely. Currently, armed struggles are being carried out in 27 provinces across the country.

The radio station said that the Thai people's armed forces have employed the strategies and tactics of people's war, fully demonstrating the immense power of people's war. Over the past two years, they have killed or wounded 1,106 enemies and captured 35, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique.

The radio station said that the rapid development and growth of the people's armed forces, and the widespread armed struggle, have made the U.S.-Thai reactionaries very anxious. They have intensified their suppression, attempting to annihilate the people's armed forces. However, the enemy's suppression and "sweeping" operations have been repeatedly foiled.

The radio station emphasized that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the people's armed forces will unswervingly carry out people's war, continuously develop and grow stronger in the face of enemy "encirclement and suppression," until they completely annihilate the U.S.-Thai reactionaries and achieve final victory.

    这家电台说，泰国人民武装运用了人民战争的战略战术，发挥了人民战争的无比威力，二年多来共打死打伤敌人一千一百零六人，俘虏三十五人，沉重地打击了美泰反动集团。
    电台说，人民武装的迅速发展壮大，武装斗争烈火到处燃烧，使美泰反动派十分惊慌。它们加紧镇压，妄图消灭人民武装。但是，敌人的镇压“扫荡”一次又一次地被粉碎了。
