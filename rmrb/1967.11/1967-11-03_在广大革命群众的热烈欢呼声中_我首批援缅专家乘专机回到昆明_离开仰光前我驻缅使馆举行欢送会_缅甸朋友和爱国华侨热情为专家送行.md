In the midst of the enthusiastic cheers of the revolutionary masses, the first batch of Chinese experts assisting Myanmar returned to Kunming by special plane. Before leaving Yangon, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar held a farewell ceremony, and Myanmar friends and patriotic overseas Chinese enthusiastically saw the experts off.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 2nd: The first batch of 140 Chinese experts and technicians assisting Myanmar arrived in Kunming today by two special planes from Yangon. They were warmly welcomed and greeted by over 2,000 revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming.

The responsible comrades of the Kunming Military Region, including Lu Ruilin, and relevant department heads welcomed the experts at the airport. The Foreign Economic Liaison Commission also sent representatives to Kunming to welcome them.

The special planes safely arrived at Kunming Airport around 4 PM. When the red Chinese experts and technicians assisting Myanmar, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" as they descended from the aircraft, the welcoming crowd immediately erupted in enthusiastic applause. People continuously raised their arms and shouted:

"Heartily welcome the victory return of our country's experts and technicians assisting Myanmar!"
"Strongest protest against the reactionary crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government's anti-China and expulsion policies!"
"Strongest protest against the Ne Win reactionary government's expulsion of our experts and technicians assisting Myanmar!"
"Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!"
"Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Comrade Lu Ruilin and others warmly shook hands with the red Chinese experts and technicians assisting Myanmar, extending their cordial greetings. Today, those who came to the airport to welcome them also included the red diplomatic fighters from the Chinese Embassy and Consulate in Indonesia who had just returned to Kunming.

The comrades from the Consulate General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming also came to the airport to welcome them.

According to Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Yangon news: Due to the treacherous actions of the Ne Win reactionary government in Myanmar, which unilaterally tore up the economic and technological cooperation agreements between China and Myanmar and expelled Chinese experts, the first batch of 140 Chinese experts today boarded two special planes sent by the Chinese government and returned to their homeland.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, Xiao Ming, and other embassy staff, as well as staff from other Chinese institutions in Myanmar, went to the airport to see them off. Some Myanmar friends and representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese also came to the airport to see them off.

Before leaving the Chinese Embassy for the airport, the Chinese experts gathered under a large banner reading "Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" They loudly read quotations from Chairman Mao and took a group photo with the embassy staff.

Some Myanmar friends and hundreds of representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese, upon hearing the news that the Chinese experts were leaving Myanmar to return to their homeland, defied the strict surveillance of plainclothes agents sent by the reactionary government and rushed to the airport to bid farewell to the Chinese experts.

The flight attendants presented portraits of Chairman Mao and shiny Mao badges to the experts under the two planes to express their respect for the Chinese red experts. Before boarding the planes, all present held the red treasure book and read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" aloud. They also sang the revolutionary song "The East is Red." The patriotic overseas Chinese also joined in the singing. The melodious voices echoed through the sky.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, November 2nd: The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar held a grand farewell ceremony for the Chinese experts on the evening of the 1st. These Chinese experts were brutally expelled due to the Ne Win reactionary government's unilateral tearing up of the economic and technological cooperation agreements between China and Myanmar. They had just arrived in Yangon from various work sites, preparing to return to their great motherland.

Acting Charge d'affaires Xiao Ming of the Chinese Embassy spoke at the farewell ceremony, condemning the Ne Win reactionary government's treacherous actions of unilaterally tearing up the economic and technological cooperation agreements between the two countries and expelling Chinese experts.

Xiao Ming praised the Chinese experts for following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, working hard, and sharing joys and sorrows with the Myanmar people. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Myanmar peoples cannot be destroyed by any reactionary forces. He finally asked the Chinese experts to convey the highest respect of the Chinese Embassy and all staff of Chinese institutions in Myanmar to our great leader Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life.

Zhang Wenqi, a representative of the Chinese experts, spoke on behalf of all Chinese experts. He strongly condemned the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government, saying that the Chinese experts, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, worked hard with the Myanmar people, sharing joys and sorrows, and forged deep friendships. No one in the world can destroy this friendship.

Zhang Wenqi said that after returning to China, the experts will continue to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and actively participate in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The farewell ceremony was filled with a warm atmosphere of revolutionary comradeship. Everyone continuously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" They also sang "The East is Red," "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helmsman," and songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."
