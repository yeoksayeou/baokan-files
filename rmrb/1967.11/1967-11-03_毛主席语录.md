	Chairman Mao's Quotations
		Students are the same. They should focus on learning as their main task, while also studying other subjects. This means not only studying literature but also studying industry, agriculture, and military affairs. They should also criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not be allowed to continue.

    毛主席语录
    学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。
