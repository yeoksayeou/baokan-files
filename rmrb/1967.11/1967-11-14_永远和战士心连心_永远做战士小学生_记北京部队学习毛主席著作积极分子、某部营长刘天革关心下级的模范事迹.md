The greatest and most sublime love in the world is the revolutionary masses' love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The most sincere and profound emotion in the world is the blood-bonded affection between class brothers.

Comrade Liu Tiange, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Military Region and a company commander in a certain unit, loves Chairman Mao deeply and has a heart full of warmth for his class brothers. He never separates himself from the masses, humbly learns from them, and constantly draws nourishment from them. He is willing to sacrifice his life for his class brothers. He says: "Mao Zedong Thought is like sunlight and rain, nurturing my growth and strength; the people are like soil and air, cultivating my roots and sprouts."

To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai

On the afternoon of September 3, 1966, it was drizzling by the Bohai Sea. Company Commander Liu Tiange personally led several dozen new soldiers to conduct their first live grenade training.

The grenade throwing cover was set on the slope of the flood embankment. The new soldiers, filled with hatred for the American imperialists and class enemies, treated the throwing field as a battlefield and practiced real combat skills. Grenades flew from east to west, accurately hitting the targets and exploding with loud booms.

When it was New Soldier Miao Fawang's turn to throw, an unexpected situation occurred. He wanted to throw the grenade farther, but due to excessive body rotation and delayed release, he threw it off course, landing it only about two meters away on the left side of the flood embankment slope.

The grenade was smoking and rolling back down the slippery slope. Grenades explode three seconds after the pin is pulled. Five soldiers standing in the exposed area within two to eight meters of the impact point were in grave danger!

At that moment, Company Commander Liu Tiange was standing in the cover to the right of Miao Fawang.

In this critical moment, the words "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" flashed through his mind. He had only one thought: "Sacrifice myself to save my class brothers!"

Liu Tiange shouted, "Hit the ground!" and himself leaped out of the cover, pushing Miao Fawang aside, and rushed forward to the soldiers in front of him, straight towards the smoking grenade rolling down.

"To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai," this great voice guided Liu Tiange's every action. To block the grenade fragments from hitting the soldiers, he deliberately took another step forward, propped himself up with his right hand, raised his body, and with his left hand grabbed the grenade, forcefully throwing it out towards the embankment.

Just as the grenade left his hand, it exploded in mid-air. With a loud bang, Liu Tiange collapsed to the ground. He was hit by over eighty large and small fragments, with severe injuries to his head. The five soldiers behind him, however, were unharmed.

The Bohai Sea is wide, but not as wide as the broad hearts of revolutionary soldiers; the Bohai Sea is deep, but not as deep as the affection between class brothers.

The soldiers rushed over, gathering around Liu Tiange. They had tears of excitement in their eyes and called out affectionately, "Company Commander, Company Commander!" Each of their hearts swelled with waves of emotion. Company Commander Liu, in over twenty years of battle, you have faced death countless times. You have thought of the revolution, of your class brothers, but never of yourself.

When you were a soldier, a grenade fell near two comrades, you rushed over, grabbed the about-to-explode grenade, and threw it into the pond, saving your comrades.

When you were a squad leader, the unit was advancing south, crossing mountains and rivers. Suddenly, a flood surged, you risked being swept into the abyss to rescue three comrades.

When you were a staff officer, a soldier accidentally pulled a connected detonator, this detonator fell among hundreds of other detonators, ready to explode at any moment. You rushed over, grabbed the detonator, and threw it out of the courtyard.

When you were a platoon leader, the unit was working, a several dozen-pound stone rolled down the slope, about to hit the soldiers below. You immediately ran over, blocking and hugging the stone to stop it.

When you were a deputy section chief, disregarding your poor swimming skills, you jumped into the river, bravely saving a child who had fallen into the water.

Today, you used your body to protect our safety....

The soldiers' tears of excitement fell on the company commander. Liu Tiange regained consciousness from his faint. He heard the soldiers' calls and with great effort opened his eyes, anxiously saying, "Don't worry about me, quickly go save the others!"

The soldiers excitedly said, "Company Commander, don't worry, we are all fine!"

Liu Tiange was a bit disbelieving, saying, "Let me see." He tried to get up to check for himself. But due to his severe head injury, as soon as he lifted his head, he fainted again.

The soldiers quickly loaded Liu Tiange onto the ambulance. The communication officer leaned over him and asked, "Company Commander, what should we bring to the hospital for you?" Liu Tiange, in his faint, replied, "Don't forget to bring my Chairman Mao's works."

On the night of September 5, after the doctor removed the fragments from Liu Tiange's skull, he lay in the hospital bed, unconscious for three whole days. The unit leaders, officers, soldiers, and Red Guards came to visit him, filled with excitement and anxiety, but he knew nothing. On the morning of September 8, Liu Tiange seemed to hear someone calling him affectionately:

"Company Commander, open your eyes and look, Chairman Mao is smiling at you."

Liu Tiange's body pain seemed to disappear instantly, he hurriedly loosened his head bandage, and with great effort opened his eyes.

The bright sunlight illuminated the ward, making it exceptionally bright. Liu Tiange focused his gaze on the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in front of his bed. Chairman Mao was smiling at him! A warm current of happiness surged through his heart and spread throughout his body:

"Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the brightest red sun in our hearts! Thinking of you, I have the boundless strength to overcome everything!"

Liu Tiange lay in the hospital bed and shouted with all his might, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Then he softly sang:

The East is red, the sun is rising,
China has given birth to Mao Zedong.

Soon, Liu Tiange's injured right hand began to move. He struggled to get out of bed, leaned over the table, and tried to write. But as soon as he picked up the pen, his hand trembled. He then took a matchstick, dipped it in ink, and wrote five large characters, expressing his boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao:

Long live Chairman Mao!

Our cadres must care for every soldier

Comrade Liu Tiange's touching deed of risking his life to save his class brothers fully embodies his care and love for the soldiers and his profound class feelings. This deep class feeling permeates his every word and deed.

New soldier Guo Jingyu, after enlisting, wanted to learn some skills but was assigned to a production unit, causing him to have some grievances and often causing trouble. The unit's officers and soldiers all reflected: this new soldier is too mischievous.

Liu Tiange thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together.... Our cadres must care for every soldier, all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." He realized that soldiers having flaws is not surprising; helping soldiers progress is the duty of cadres.

One day, Liu Tiange had a heart-to-heart talk with Xiao Guo. He first told the story of Zhang Zedong burning charcoal, then told his own family history. When he spoke of his father being driven to death by the landlord, causing his family to be ruined, he shed tears of sorrow and spoke earnestly to Xiao Guo, "We must not forget the past bitterness, we must not forget our roots! Without Chairman Mao, without countless heroes like Comrade Zhang Zedong who toiled for the revolution, how could we have today's socialist country. We do revolution, we must take Comrade Zhang Zedong as an example, do what the Party asks us to do."

Liu Tiange's words touched Xiao Guo's class feelings. In the old society, Xiao Guo's mother worked for the landlord and suffered cruel torment. He choked back tears and said painfully, "Company Commander, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, not forget the past bitterness, and do as Comrade Zhang Zedong did. I hope the company commander will help me more." Liu Tiange happily said, "We are bitterness gourds on the same vine, class brothers, let's help each other in the future."

From then on, Liu Tiange and Guo Jingyu became a pair, starting the "Red Pair" activity. When the evaluation came, Xiao Guo did not get the "Five Good" rating, and soon fell ill, developing a "break the pot and smash it" mentality. Liu Tiange then studied "Put Down Your Burdens and Start Your Engines" with Xiao Guo, encouraging him, "A traveler with a burden cannot walk far; a revolutionary with selfishness cannot revolutionize to the end. Having a sick body is not a big deal, but having a sick mind is. Xiao Guo's thoughts cleared, his spirit soared, and he often received praise, developing a sense of complacency. Liu Tiange then studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind" with Xiao Guo, encouraging him to prevent arrogance and strive for better. Under Liu Tiange's patient help, Xiao Guo made rapid progress, soon joined the League, and was rated as a "Five Good" soldier.

Chairman Mao said: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless to the enemy, crush it, annihilate it; second, be united with our own people, the people, comrades, superiors, and subordinates, be united." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, Liu Tiange treats soldiers with fiery enthusiasm.

During the autumn harvest, a platoon leader reported to Liu Tiange, "There is an old soldier who has been lacking in spirit recently, it must be because the production tasks are heavy, afraid of hardship." Liu Tiange thought, "If a soldier does not progress quickly, it shows that our ideological work is not done well, we cannot blame the soldier first." He then instructed the platoon leader, "Help the soldier patiently," and went to the class himself to understand the old soldier's situation.

A few days later, the platoon leader came to report the old soldier's problem again. Liu Tiange smiled and asked him, "Have you seen 'Battle on Shangganling Mountain'?" The platoon leader said confusedly, "I've seen it several times!" Liu Tiange said, "Why didn't the leadership send biscuits to the 8th Company, but sent them water?" The platoon leader said, "Because biscuits cannot quench thirst!" Liu Tiange said, "Right! They lack water, no matter how many biscuits you send, it's useless. Digging a tree, dig the roots; beating a drum, beat the heart; ideological work must be done to the point. I think the old soldier is not afraid of hardship, you investigate again."

The platoon leader returned to the platoon and, after thorough investigation, found that the old soldier's work spirit was not high indeed because he had arthritis. Thinking of how he had wronged the soldier, he felt very sad.

This incident deeply educated the platoon leader. He said to the company commander, "The soldier is sick, why didn't I discover it so soon, it shows that I don't care enough for the soldiers." Liu Tiange said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Our cadres must care for every soldier.' Do not underestimate this problem! If cadres cannot care for and love soldiers, the army cannot be united, cannot have strong combat effectiveness, and cannot be the people's army of the proletariat."

Consult with the masses on every matter, be a student of the masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Many people do not handle the relationship between officers and soldiers, military and civilians well, thinking it is a matter of method. I always tell them it is an attitude (or fundamental purpose) problem. This attitude is to respect soldiers and respect the people." He also said, "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the people's heads."

Liu Tiange remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, regards himself as an ordinary laborer, respects soldiers, and never puts on an official air, honestly being a student of the masses.

When the unit was harvesting rice, Liu Tiange took turns going to each company to work with the soldiers. He saw that a platoon leader in the 2nd Company rarely worked and put on airs. He went over and said to the platoon leader, "Come, let's have a competition." Saying this, the two started swinging their sickles. At first, the speed was about the same, but later the platoon leader fell behind. Liu Tiange saw the platoon leader fall behind and slowed down to let him catch up, asking him, "How is it, falling behind?" The platoon leader said, "What's the big deal, just work hard!" Liu Tiange smiled warmly, "That's right! I work in front, you don't fall behind; you work in front, the soldiers don't fall behind. Cadres leading by example is a silent order, a powerful call!"

A few words made the platoon leader's face flush. He finally understood the company commander's intention to compete with him. He said, "In the future, I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, not shout in the field, but work in the field!"

Liu Tiange then emphasized, "Work, there is a more important meaning. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, it helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism.' We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always regard ourselves as ordinary laborers. A machine that is not used for a long time will rust; a person who does not work for a long time will become revisionist!"

Liu Tiange educates subordinate cadres like this, and he himself is a model in this regard. During training, he rolls in the mud with the soldiers; during construction, he insists on working with the class, going to the most difficult and dangerous places; during production, he works with the soldiers.

One early morning in March last year, the cold wind howled, and the water surface was covered with ice. The team's production office director Zheng Quan got up and walked towards the construction site. He saw a person standing in the water, shoveling mud. He thought, "Who is working so early, not afraid of the cold, what spirit!" Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Company Commander Liu Tiange. Only seeing him standing in the water barefoot, his legs red from the cold. He said, "Old Liu, you can't take this!" Liu Tiange smiled and said, "Today the unit is digging river mud, I came to try it first." Zheng Quan advised, "It's so cold, you are in your forties, how can you compare with the young guys!" Liu Tiange said, "Old Zheng, Chairman Mao teaches us, to know the taste of a pear, you must taste it yourself. I don't try it first, I have no basis. If I don't taste the soldiers' bitterness, I won't know their hearts, how can I command the unit?"

Among the masses, Liu Tiange is not only an ordinary laborer and a common soldier, but also a humble student. He deeply feels from practice the wisdom of Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge."

In the autumn of 1965, Liu Tiange had been a company commander for just over two months. One day, he went to various companies to inspect the internal affairs. When he arrived at the 3rd Company's 2nd Platoon, a new soldier said to him, "Don't just look at the internal affairs, don't always squat in the company, come to our platoon and squat!" Liu Tiange heard this, smiled, and did not pay much attention.

On the way back, Liu Tiange thought about the new soldier's words. Reflecting on the past two months, he had been busy trying to complete the tasks given by the Party and Chairman Mao. But he was always busy, focusing on superficial and clerical work. Sometimes when he went to the companies, he only checked the beds and internal affairs, picking at the small things and missing the big picture. Thinking of this, Liu Tiange suddenly felt that the new soldier's criticism was very important. He asked himself two questions: one is to grasp the fundamentals, grasp the center, grasp the key points; the other is to go deep into the actual situation, go deep into the masses, and do more investigations and research. This soldier's criticism hit the nail on the head.

Liu Tiange corrected his mistakes. He immediately went to the 2nd Platoon, first found the new soldier, thanked him for his good advice, and further asked him for guidance. Then he squatted in the 2nd Platoon to investigate. Through the investigation, he found that the 2nd Platoon indeed had some big problems: the relationship between the platoon leader and the deputy platoon leader, and the squad leaders was not good, and there were problems with their management methods. Liu Tiange studied Chairman Mao's works with the soldiers of the 2nd Platoon, solved the problems, and the work of the 2nd Platoon made great progress.

This incident gave Liu Tiange a great enlightenment. This shows that the higher the position, the farther from the soldiers, the more likely one is to detach from the masses. Therefore, one must go to the masses more, learn from the masses. Only by placing oneself among the masses can one do a good job in ideological revolutionization and do a good job.

In early April, the first batch of nylon film seedlings began. This is the key to ensuring a bumper harvest of rice for the year. The newly hatched seedlings are afraid of cold, heat, wind, and rain. The early spring on the Bohai coast has unpredictable weather changes, often with cold waves. The seedlings could be harmed at any time. At this critical moment, Liu Tiange decided to go to the production front line to command the battle. Someone tried to stop him, saying, "The company commander should stay in the company to oversee the overall work." "The seedling field is only over two thousand meters away from the company, it's convenient to go and check at any time." Liu Tiange said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'All practical workers must go down to investigate.' To find reasons not to go down, one can always find them, but this is an excuse for the lazy. The most important thing is to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

Liu Tiange went to the 2nd Platoon, worked with the soldiers during the day, studied with the soldiers at night, and slept with the soldiers in the small shed by the field at night. When there were ideological problems, he asked the soldiers for criticism and help, and when there were work difficulties, he discussed and researched with the soldiers. He relied on the wisdom and creativity of the masses to overcome one difficulty after another.

Not long after the seedlings grew, one evening, a frost warning was suddenly received, the seedlings would be seriously threatened. What to do? A phone call to the regiment said, "We haven't thought of a solution yet," and asked the company commander to go to the regiment to discuss.

Before going to the regiment meeting, Liu Tiange first held a "Zhuge Liang" meeting with the soldiers, asking the soldiers for advice. Everyone discussed repeatedly, and there was only one way: cover the nylon film with quilts, coats, etc. Liu Tiange brought this suggestion to the regiment, and it was immediately accepted.

A grand battle to protect the seedlings began. The entire company's officers and soldiers covered all the seedlings with their quilts, mattresses, coats, raincoats, and everything that could be used, ensuring the safety of all the seedlings.

That night, Liu Tiange and the soldiers squeezed into the small shed by the field, singing songs, feeling warm-hearted. The soldiers' wisdom and public-spirited noble qualities deeply moved him. The vivid facts fully proved: the most intelligent, most talented, and most experienced in practice are the soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

"The people, only the people, are the creators of world history."

Comrade Liu Tiange said, from studying Chairman Mao's great teachings, he deeply felt that believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit is a big issue related to our Party, our army, and our country never changing color. He is determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, regard himself as a revolutionary force, and constantly regard himself as the object of the revolution. Be a lifelong servant of the people, be a lifelong student of the masses, fight selfishness and criticize revisionism for a lifetime, only in this way can one maintain revolutionary youth for a lifetime, follow the great leader Chairman Mao for a lifetime, and do revolution for a lifetime.

    永远和战士心连心　永远做战士小学生
    ——记北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部营长刘天革关心
    下级的模范事迹
    世界上最伟大、最崇高的爱，是革命群众对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。
    世界上最真挚、最深厚的感情，是阶级兄弟之间的血肉深情。
    北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部营长刘天革同志，对毛主席无限热爱，对阶级兄弟满腔热忱。他一刻也不脱离群众，虚心向群众学习，不断地从群众中吸取营养。他为了阶级兄弟不惜献出自己的生命。他说：“毛泽东思想好比阳光和雨露，照耀我成长壮大；人民群众好比土壤和空气，培育我生根发芽。”
    为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重
    一九六六年九月三日下午，渤海岸边下着蒙蒙细雨。营长刘天革亲自带领几十名新战士，进行第一次实弹投掷训练。
    投弹掩体设在防洪堤的坡上。新战士们怀着对美帝国主义和阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，把投弹场当战场，苦练实战过硬本领。手榴弹一个个由东向西，准确地飞向目标，爆发出声声巨响。
    当轮到新战士苗发旺投掷时，一个意外情况发生了。他本想使劲把手榴弹投远些，但由于转体过大，出手过晚，投偏了方向，把手榴弹投到了左侧只有二米多远的防洪堤坡上。
    手榴弹冒着青烟，沿着光滑的斜坡，直往回滚下来。手榴弹在拉火后三秒多就要爆炸。离弹着点二至八米的暴露地形上，站着五名战士，他们的生命受到严重威胁！
    营长刘天革，这时正站在苗发旺右侧的掩体里。
    在这千钧一发的时刻，他脑子里闪出了十三个金光闪闪的大字：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。他心里只有一个念头：“宁可牺牲自己，也要抢救阶级兄弟！”
    刘天革大喊一声：“卧倒！”自己却猛地跃出掩体，推开苗发旺，一下窜到战士们的前头，直向冒烟滚来的手榴弹扑去。
      “为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，这个伟大的声音指挥着刘天革的每一个行动。他为了用身体挡住手榴弹爆炸时飞向战士的弹片，特地又向前跨了一步，右手撑地，抬高身姿，左手抓着弹体，使劲向堤外撩去。
    手榴弹刚出手，就在空中爆炸了。随着一声巨响，刘天革昏倒在地上。他身中大小弹片八十多处，头部负了重伤。而在他身后的五名战士，却安全无恙。
    渤海湾宽哪，宽不过革命战士广阔的胸襟；渤海水深哪，深不过阶级兄弟友爱的深情。
    战士们一齐涌上去，围在刘天革身边，他们含着激动的泪珠，亲切地呼唤：“营长，营长！”个个心头激起滚滚波涛。刘营长啊！在二十多年战斗的岁月里，你出生入死，你想到的是革命，是阶级兄弟，唯独没有想到自己。
    你当战士的时候，一枚手榴弹落到两名战友脚下，你冲上去，抓起即将爆炸的手榴弹，扔进水塘，保护了战友。
    你当班长的时候，部队向南进军，横渡山河，突然山洪爆发，你冒着自己被冲下深渊的危险，救护三名战友脱险。
    你当参谋的时候，一个战士不慎将接续好的雷管拉着，这个雷管掉在几百个雷管堆当中，随时可能引起爆炸。你飞奔过去，抓起这个雷管，掷出院外。
    你当连长的时候，部队施工，一块几十斤重的石头顺坡下滚，眼看要砸着下面的战士。你立即跑上去，连堵带抱，把石头挡住。
    你当副股长的时候，不顾自己水性不好，跳到河里，奋不顾身地救起失足落水的儿童。
    今天，你又用自己的身体，保护了我们的安全。……
    战士们激动的泪珠，掉到营长身上。刘天革从昏迷中清醒过来了。他听到战士的呼唤声，用力睁开眼睛，焦急地说：“你们不要管我，快去救别的同志！”
    战士们激动地说：“营长，你放心吧，我们都是好好的呀！”
    刘天革有些不相信，说：“让我看看。”他想起身亲自查看一下。但由于头部负伤过重，刚抬起头，又昏倒了。
    战士们很快把刘天革抬上救护车。通信员伏在他身边问道：“营长，到医院要给你带些什么？”刘天革在昏迷中回答说：“别忘了给我带上毛主席著作。”
    九月五日夜间，医生从刘天革同志的颅脑里取出弹片后，刘天革躺在病床上，整整三天昏迷不醒。部队首长、干部战士、红卫兵小将们，怀着激动和焦急的心情来看望他，他一点也不知道。九月八日早晨，刘天革好象听到有人在亲切地喊着：
    “营长，你快睁开眼睛看一看，毛主席向你微笑哩。”
    刘天革全身的疼痛似乎立即消失了，他连忙松了松头部的绷带，用力睁开眼睛。
    灿烂的阳光把病房照得分外明亮。刘天革定神注视着挂在床前的毛主席像，毛主席微笑着在看他哩！顿时一股幸福的暖流涌上心头，传遍全身：
      “毛主席啊毛主席！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！一想到您，我就有了战胜一切的无穷力量！”
    刘天革躺在病床上，用力喊了声：“毛主席万岁！”接着又小声地唱起来：
    东方红，太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东。
    不久，刘天革负伤的右手开始能动弹了。他使劲爬下床，伏到桌子上，想写字。可是，钢笔一拿到手里，手就发抖。他便拿了一根火柴棒，沾了墨水，一笔一划地写下五个大字，表达了他对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情：
    毛主席万岁！
    我们的干部要关心每一个战士
    刘天革同志冒着生命危险抢救阶级兄弟的动人事迹，高度地体现了他对战士的关心、爱护，对阶级兄弟无比深厚的阶级感情。这种深厚的阶级感情，贯注在他平时的一言一行里。
    新战士郭景玉入伍后，满心想学点技术，没想被分配到担任生产任务的连队，思想上有了疙瘩，常爱闹点别扭。连队干部战士都反映：这个新战士太调皮。
    刘天革想到毛主席的教导：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”使他认识到，战士有缺点，并不奇怪；帮助战士进步，是干部的责任。
    一天，刘天革找小郭谈心。他先讲了张思德烧木炭的故事，又讲了自己的家史。当讲到父亲被财主逼死，弄得家破人亡的时候，伤心地流了泪，语重心长地对小郭说：“我们不能忘记过去的苦，不能忘本哪！没有毛主席，没有千万个象张思德同志那样为革命埋头苦干的先烈，哪能有今天的社会主义江山。咱们干革命，就要以张思德为榜样，党叫干啥就干啥。”
    刘天革一席话，触动了小郭的阶级感情。在万恶的旧社会，小郭的妈妈给地主当佣人，受尽残酷的折磨。他含着眼泪沉痛地说：“营长，我一定听毛主席的话，不忘过去的苦，照张思德的样子去做。希望营长多多帮助。”刘天革高兴地说：“咱俩是一根藤上的苦瓜，是阶级兄弟，以后互相帮助。”
    从此，刘天革和郭景玉结了对，开始了“一对红”活动。总评的时候，小郭因为没评上五好，不久又生了病，产生了“破罐子破摔”的思想。刘天革便和小郭一起学习《放下包袱，开动机器》。开导小郭说：“赶路的人，背着包袱走不了长路；革命的人，带着私心不能革命到底。干革命不是为了受表扬。身体有病不要紧，要紧的是思想不能有病。”小郭思想一通，干劲大了，进步更快，经常受表扬，又产生了自满情绪。刘天革又和小郭一起学习毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，鼓励小郭防止骄傲，好上加好。在刘天革耐心帮助下，小郭进步很快，不久入了团，评上了五好战士。
    毛主席说：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”遵循毛主席的教导，刘天革以火一般的热忱对待战士。
    秋收的时候，有位排长向刘天革反映：“有个老战士这一阵劲头不大，准是生产任务重，怕吃苦。”刘天革想：“战士进步不快，说明我们思想工作没做好，不能首先怪战士。”便一面交代排长：“帮助战士要耐心。”一面自己就亲自到班里了解那个老战士的情况。
    过了几天，排长又来反映那个老战士的问题。刘天革笑着问他：“你看过《上甘岭》吗？”排长迷惑不解地说：“看过好几遍啦！”刘天革说：“领导上为什么不给八连送饼干，而给他们送水呢？”排长说：“因为饼干解不了渴啊！”刘天革说：“对呀！人家缺的是水，你饼干送得再多也没用，刨树要刨根，敲锣要敲心，思想工作要做到点子上。我看那个老战士不是怕苦，你再调查调查。”
    排长回到排里，经过深入了解，才知道那个老战士劳动劲头不大，确实是因为有关节炎。想到过去自己错怪了战士，心里很难过。
    这件事深刻地教育了排长。他对营长说：“战士有病，我为什么这么久没发现，说明自己对战士关心不够。”刘天革说：“我们要牢记毛主席的教导：‘我们的干部要关心每一个战士’。决不要小看这个问题啊！干部如果不能关心爱护战士，军队就不能团结一致，就不可能有坚强的战斗力，也就不能成为无产阶级的人民军队。”
    遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生
    毛主席教导我们：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。”又说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”
    刘天革牢记毛主席的教导，把自己当作普通劳动者，尊重士兵，从来不摆官架子，老老实实做群众的小学生。
    部队割稻子的时候，刘天革轮流到各连和战士一起劳动。他看到二连一个排长，很少劳动，摆起架子来。他走过去对这个排长说：“来，咱们比试比试。”说着，两人挥镰干起来了。开始速度差不多，后来排长慢慢掉队了。刘天革看排长掉远了，便放慢速度等他赶上来，问他：“怎么样，掉队了吧！”排长说：“那有什么，使劲干呗！”刘天革亲切地笑着说：“是嘛！我干在前面，你不肯落后；你干在前面，战士就不肯落后。干部以身作则，就是无声的命令，有力的号召！”
    几句话，说得排长脸上直发烧。他这才明白营长要同他比赛的用意。便说：“今后一定听毛主席的话，不在田头喊，要在地里干！”
    刘天革又加重语气说：“干，还有更重要的意义。毛主席教导我们：‘干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。’我们要牢记毛主席的教导，永远把自己当作一个普通劳动者。机器长久不开动，就要生锈；一个人经常不劳动，就要变修！”
    刘天革这样教育下级干部，他自己更是这方面的模范。训练时和战士一起摸爬滚打；施工中坚持跟班作业，哪里最艰苦、最危险就到哪里；生产时和战士一起劳动。
    去年三月间一天清早，寒风呼啸，水面结着冰凌。团生产办公室主任郑全兴起床后向工地走去，看到一个人站在水里挥锹挖泥。心里想：“谁这么早就干上了，也不怕冷，干劲真足。”走近一看，原来是营长刘天革。只见他光着脚站在水里，两腿冻得通红。便说：“老刘，你这样干可吃不消啊！”刘天革笑着说：“今天部队挖河泥，我先来试试。”郑全兴劝道：“这么冷天，你四十来岁的人，怎能同小伙子比？”刘天革说：“老郑，毛主席教导我们，要知梨子味，亲口尝一尝。我不先干一干，心里没底。不尝战士苦，就不知战士心哪！怎么指挥部队？”
    在群众之中，刘天革不仅是一个普通劳动者，普通一兵，而且是一个虚心的小学生。他从实践中深刻体会到毛主席的英明教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”
    一九六五年秋天，刘天革担任营长才两个多月。一天，他到各连检查内务。走到三连二班，一个新战士向他说：“别光看内务，也别老蹲营部，到我们班里来蹲蹲吧！”刘天革听了，笑了笑，没有在意。
    回来的路上，刘天革想起这个新战士的话。细想两个月来，自己是努力想把党和毛主席交给的任务完成好。可是，整天忙忙碌碌，抓表面上的、事务性的工作，有时到连队，也只是查查铺，看看内务，抓住芝麻，掉了西瓜。想到这里，刘天革顿时感到这个新战士的批评非常重要。他给自己提出了两个问题：一个是工作要抓住根本，要抓中心，要抓住重点；一个是要深入实际，深入群众，多作调查研究。这个战士的批评，正中自己的要害。
    刘天革知错就改。他立即到了二班，首先找这个新战士，感谢他提了很好的意见，并进一步向他请教。接着就蹲在二班作调查。经过调查，发现二班确实存在一些较大的问题：班长与副班长、小组长的关系不太好，管教方法有问题。刘天革与二班战士一起学习毛主席著作，问题解决了，二班工作有了很大进步。
    这件事，给了刘天革很大启发。这说明，职务越高，离战士越远，就越容易脱离群众。这就越是要多到群众中去，向群众学习。只有把自己放在群众之中，才能搞好思想革命化，才能做好工作。
    四月初，第一批尼龙薄膜育秧开始了。这是争取全年水稻丰收的关键。刚刚出壳的秧苗，怕冷怕热，怕风怕雨。而渤海滩上的早春，气候变化无常，常有寒流袭击。秧苗随时都可能遭到伤害。在这节骨眼上，刘天革决定到生产第一线去指挥战斗。有人劝阻说：“营长要在营里抓全面工作。”“秧苗地离营部只有两千多米，随时去看看也很方便。”刘天革说：“毛主席教导我们：‘一切实际工作者必须向下作调查。’要找不下去的‘理由’，总能找到，但这是懒人找的借口。千重要，万重要，照毛主席指示办事最重要。”
    刘天革到了二班，白天和战士一起劳动，晚上和战士一起学习，夜里和战士一起住在田头的小窝棚里。有了思想问题，请战士批评帮助，工作遇到困难，和战士商量研究。他依靠群众的智慧和创造，克服了一个个困难。
    秧苗长出不久，一天傍晚，突然接到霜冻预报，秧苗将受到严重威胁。怎么办？打电话请示团里，回答说“还没想出办法”，要营长到团里研究。
    在去团部开会以前，刘天革先找战士开“诸葛亮”会，向战士请教。大家反复研究，只有一个办法：把棉被、大衣等盖到尼龙薄膜上。刘天革把这个建议带到团部，立即被接受了。
    一场轰轰烈烈的保苗战斗开始了。全营干部、战士，把自己的被子、褥子、大衣、雨衣等一切能盖的东西，都铺到秧苗田的尼龙薄膜上，保证了全部秧苗的安全。
    这天夜里，刘天革和战士们一起，挤在田头的小窝棚里，唱着歌，心里暖烘烘的。战士的智慧和一心为公的高贵品质，使他深深感动。生动的事实充分证明了：最聪明、最有才能、最有实践经验的，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    刘天革同志说，从学习毛主席的伟大教导中，深深体会到，相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众的首创精神，是关系到我们党、我们军队、我们国家永不变色的大问题。他决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决响应毛主席关于要斗私，批修的伟大号召，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又不断地把自己当作革命的对象。当一辈子人民的勤务员，做一辈子群众的小学生，搞一辈子斗私批修，这样才能一辈子保持革命的青春，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。
