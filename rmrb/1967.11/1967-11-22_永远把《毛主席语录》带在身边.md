Always Keep the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" With You

In the German Democratic Republic, a Ghanaian student received a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and jumped for joy. He said: "None of you can understand my feelings right now. I am so excited! This is my most precious treasure. I will always carry the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' with me. I will always study! Without studying Chairman Mao's works, one cannot make revolution!"
