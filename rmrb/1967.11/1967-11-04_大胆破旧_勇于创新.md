Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao issued new directives on educational revolution: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end." We firmly respond and resolutely carry out these directives.

To fundamentally uproot the soil for the restoration of capitalism and prevent revisionism, we must thoroughly revolutionize the existing educational system in our country. We must completely overthrow the old educational system and establish a brand-new proletarian educational system guided by Mao Zedong Thought. This is the extremely glorious and great historical task facing all of us revolutionary masses, especially all revolutionary teachers and students.

We are engaged in an extremely glorious and great undertaking that our predecessors have never done before. We must be bold, and with the unparalleled courage of the proletarian revolutionaries to thoroughly destroy the old world and build a new world, dare to defy the ancients, defy foreigners, and defy "authorities." We must overthrow and trample underfoot all irrational old things. If we hesitate and fear to break with the old, and are full of misgivings about creating new things, we will only end up with reformism. We must, under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, dare to imagine, dare to create, dare to experiment, and resolutely fight against difficulties to achieve the great victory of the educational revolution. In this regard, Shanghai Tongji University and other schools have set us an example.

Secondary education is an important link in the entire educational process, bearing the heavy responsibility of providing personnel for the socialist revolution and construction and cultivating students for higher-level schools. The middle school stage plays a crucial role in determining which class the youth will succeed. The direction and line of secondary education directly relate to the future color of our country. However, the existing secondary education system is basically a continuation of the system established in the 18th century in England and America, plus some junk imported from the Soviet Union by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the educational field. It completely fails to meet the needs of the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment in the 1960s. Therefore, we, the proletarian revolutionaries in secondary education, must immediately carry out a thorough revolution in the secondary education system and contribute all our efforts to the entire proletarian educational revolution.

There are many irrational aspects in the old secondary education system that must be immediately reformed. Here, we would like to discuss the three principles that must be followed in reforming the secondary curriculum:

1. **Emphasize Politics**: In the past, the curriculum was severely detached from politics and class struggle, especially failing to prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with practical issues. Although some of Chairman Mao's works were included in the curriculum, they were often studied theoretically without practical application, sometimes even as ordinary literary works. This phenomenon must be thoroughly changed. In the future, the study of Chairman Mao's works and Mao Zedong Thought must be the primary content of secondary education. We must, as Chairman Mao taught, make class struggle a core subject, so that students, through a few years of study and practical struggle, can basically establish a proletarian revolutionary worldview and stand firm in the face of complex class struggles. We must fundamentally change the revisionist educational line of focusing on transmitting knowledge and make mastering the stance, viewpoint, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought the top priority.

2. **Connect with Reality**: The old secondary curriculum is severely detached from reality and productive labor. Many students from urban families, after years of study, still cannot distinguish between grains and vegetables, and lack the thought and feelings of the working people. If this trend continues, they will inevitably become spiritual aristocrats standing above the working people. Therefore, we must follow Chairman Mao's directive: "To combine education with productive labor," and make productive labor an important and fixed subject in secondary education. At the same time, all subjects must be closely linked to the practical struggles of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, so that what is learned can be applied and solve practical problems, fundamentally changing the situation where "after years of study, one knows nothing when asked; knowledge is abundant, but nothing can be done."

3. **Single Progression**: Currently, the secondary curriculum is completely copied from the "genius education" of the West. The characteristic of bourgeois "genius education" is the so-called "natural selection," with many stages, repetitions, and layers of "selection," ultimately cultivating a few "elites" to serve the bourgeoisie. Some subjects are taught repeatedly in primary school, junior high, and senior high, in a cycle that is very cumbersome. We believe that we must completely break away from the four-tier system of primary, junior high, senior high, and establish a single ordinary education system. From the goal of better and faster cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, we should unify the curriculum, highlight the main subjects, and cultivate students into "socialist-minded, cultured laborers." In this way, the school system can be greatly shortened, and teachers and equipment can be greatly saved, enabling the proletarian educational cause to develop better and faster.

Reforming the entire old educational system is a long-term and arduous task that requires all revolutionary teachers and students to engage in persistent and arduous struggles. We follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the creative spirit of the masses. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as our goal, we will surely achieve victory!

Our goal must be achieved.

Our goal will definitely be achieved.

    大胆破旧　勇于创新
    北京三十一中革命委员会
    最近，我们伟大的领袖毛主席向我们发出了关于教育革命的最新指示：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”我们坚决响应，坚决执行。
    为了从根本上铲除复辟资本主义的土壤，防止修正主义，必须对我国现存的教育体系进行彻底的革命。彻底破除旧的教育体系，建立以毛泽东思想为指针的崭新的无产阶级教育体系，这是我们广大革命群众，特别是全体革命师生面临的极其光荣伟大的历史任务。
    我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我们必须敢字当头，拿出无产阶级革命派彻底破坏旧世界、建立新世界的无比勇气，敢于藐视古人，藐视洋人，藐视“权威”，把不合理的旧事物推翻打倒，踩在脚下。如果对破除旧事物犹豫害怕，对创立新事物顾虑重重，那就只能是修修补补的改良主义。我们必须在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导下，敢于设想，敢于创造，敢于试验，坚决同困难作斗争，争取教育革命的伟大的胜利。在这一点上，上海同济大学等学校，为我们做出了榜样。
    中学教育是整个教育过程中的一个承上启下的重要环节，担负着为社会主义革命和社会主义建设输送人材，为高一级学校培养学生的重大任务。青年学生究竟成为哪一个阶级的接班人，中学阶段起着十分重要的作用。中学教育按照什么方向，什么路线去办，直接关系到我们国家未来的颜色。而现存的中学教育体系，基本上是沿袭英美十八世纪以后创立起来的一套，再加上中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育界的代理人从苏修贩买来的一些破烂货；完全不能适应二十世纪六十年代进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命的需要。因此，我们中学无产阶级革命派，必须立即对中学教育制度进行彻底的革命，为整个无产阶级教育革命贡献我们的一切力量。
    旧的中学教育制度有许多不合理的地方必须立即加以改革。这里，我们想先谈一谈改革中学课程设置必须遵循的三个原则：
    一、突出政治。过去的课程设置严重地脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争，特别是没有把联系实际学习毛主席著作放在首要地位。虽然过去也安排了几篇毛主席著作的学习，但往往是从理论到理论地学，甚至作为普通的文学作品来学。这种现象必须彻底改变。今后，一定要把学习毛主席著作，学习毛泽东思想，作为中学教育的主要内容。一定要象毛主席教导的那样，把阶级斗争作为一门主课，使学生通过几年的学习和实际斗争的锻炼，基本上树立起无产阶级革命的世界观，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中经得起考验。必须从根本上改变中学以传授知识为主的修正主义教育路线，而把掌握毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法作为头等重要的任务。
    二、联系实际。旧的中学课程设置严重地脱离实际，脱离生产劳动。不少家在城市的学生学了几年，依然五谷不分，菽麦不辨，既不能参加生产劳动，更缺乏劳动人民的思想感情，发展下去，必然成为高踞于劳动人民头上的精神贵族。因此，我们必须遵照毛主席的指示：“使教育与劳动联系起来”，把生产劳动作为中学教育的一门重要的固定的课程；同时，使所有课程都紧密地联系阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的实际，学了就能用上，能解决实际问题，从根本上改变“学了好几年，一问三不知；‘知识’一大堆，样样干不了”的现状。
    三、单一递进。现在中学的课程设置，完全是从英美的“天才教育”那里照搬过来的。资产阶级“天才教育”的特点，就是所谓“自然淘汰”法，环节多，重复多，层层“淘汰”，最后培养出少数为资产阶级服务的“尖子”。有的课程，小学学过了，初中又学一遍，初中学过了，高中再学一遍，循环往复，十分繁琐。我们认为，必须彻底打破初小、高小、初中、高中的四级制，建立单一的普通教育制度，从更好更快地培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的目标出发，统一设置课程，突出主要科目，把学生培养成为“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。这样，学制就可以大大缩短，师资和设备就可以大大节约，无产阶级教育事业就能更快更好地发展。
    改革整个旧的教育制度，是一项长期的艰巨的任务，需要我们全体革命师生进行艰苦的持久的斗争。我们遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为目标，就一定能取得胜利！
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。
