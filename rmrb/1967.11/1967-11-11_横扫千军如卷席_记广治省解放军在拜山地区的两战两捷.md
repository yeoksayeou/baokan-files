One morning in September, a fine drizzle fell over Baishan Village at the foot of Baishan Mountain in Quang Tri Province. The village was shrouded in a veil of rain. At that time, the brave and skilled armed forces of Quang Tri Province were already in ambush in the forests on the surrounding hills, tightly gripping their weapons, waiting for the arrival of the American aggressors. This was because the clever scouts had already reported: the marine corps of the 26th division, 3rd battalion, which had just been transferred to the American Kunthien base, was preparing to attack Baishan Village on that day.

Since the rainy season began, the liberation forces had continuously dealt heavy blows to the enemy in the Baishan area, making the American aggressors in the Kunthien and Donghe bases anxious day and night. This time, the American aggressors gathered some forces to engage the liberation forces once again.

Fortified and Ready to Capture the Enemy

They waited until eleven o'clock. It was only then that a reconnaissance platoon of the cowardly American aggressors appeared on the road. They looked around nervously and fired randomly, fearing they would fall into the ambush of the liberation forces. Finally, they saw Baishan Village and thought they would not be attacked by the liberation forces this time. However, just as they were about to enter the village, they stepped on a series of landmines laid by the guerrillas. A series of explosions left seventeen American aggressors lying on the ground, and the rest screamed and crawled back. The liberation forces' soldiers, hidden on the mountain, saw the pathetic state of the American aggressors and couldn't help but laugh to themselves.

At two o'clock in the afternoon, two companies of American aggressors, protected by ten tanks, finally entered Baishan Village. After rushing into the village, they fired randomly everywhere, but found no one. At that time, the rain was getting heavier, and the American aggressors quickly chose a place to set up camp.

As soon as the American aggressors had set up their camp, the commander of the liberation forces gave the order, and all the light and heavy weapons on the surrounding mountains opened fire on the enemy lines. A barrage of mortar shells quickly destroyed many of the enemy's tanks, and the fierce gunfire from light and heavy machine guns made the enemy stagger and suffer heavy casualties. The enemy in the nearby bases quickly sent planes to bomb and strafe, trying to cover the American aggressors trapped in the village to break out, but two planes were shot down by the liberation forces' soldiers on the spot. After more than an hour of intense battle, the liberation forces, after inflicting a devastating blow on the more than four hundred enemy soldiers in the two companies, quickly withdrew from the battle.

A Surprise Attack and Overwhelming Victory

After suffering this heavy blow, the enemy was both terrified and enraged, searching everywhere for the liberation forces but finding no one. Unexpectedly, three days later, the liberation forces suddenly appeared, launching a fierce attack on the American marine corps' positions on Huixi Mountain and several nearby hills. The artillery of the liberation forces first conducted a concentrated bombardment on the enemy positions on the 5-6 hill. The American artillery positions were completely destroyed before they could retaliate. Under the cover of powerful artillery fire, the spearhead team led by Second Platoon Commander Yang Wenxing rushed forward, destroying two enemy tanks and paving the way for victory. Although Squad Leader Nguyen Truong Thanh was injured in the leg, he still led his comrades to bravely charge into the enemy lines, using grenades and bayonets to eliminate dozens of enemy soldiers. After a short but intense battle, the soldiers quickly captured the enemy positions on the 5-6 hill.

Next, the soldiers launched a fierce assault on the enemy positions on Huixi Mountain and the 6-7 hill. The artillery of the liberation forces once again demonstrated their power, causing chaos in the enemy positions. Under the cover of powerful firepower, the soldiers quickly broke through the enemy lines and engaged in fierce close combat with the enemy. In the end, the enemy fled down the mountain in a disorderly manner, and even the tank crew abandoned their tanks and fled in panic.

In these two battles, a total of nine hundred American aggressors were eliminated, and thirty enemy tanks were destroyed. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    横扫千军如卷席
    ——记广治省解放军在拜山地区的两战两捷
    九月的一天早上，天下着蒙蒙细雨，广治省拜山山脚下的拜山村蒙在一层雨丝织成的轻纱中。这时，英勇善战的广治省解放军武装部队已经埋伏在四周山岗上的丛林里，紧紧握着手中的武器，等待着美国鬼子的到来。因为机智的侦察兵们早就报告：刚调到美军昆天据点的海军陆战队第二十六团第三营的部队，准备在这一天进犯拜山村。
    进入雨季以来，解放武装力量接连在拜山地区给予敌人以重大打击，弄得昆天和东河据点里的美国鬼子日夜不安。这次，美国鬼子结集了一些兵力，要同解放武装力量再作一次较量。
    壁垒森严　瓮中捉鳖
    一直等到十一时，胆小如鼠的美国侵略军的一个侦察排才出现在公路上。他们一路上东张西望，胡乱打枪，害怕落进了解放武装力量的伏击圈。最后，他们看到了拜山村，以为这一次不会遭到解放武装力量的袭击了。不料，刚要走进村子，就踩响了游击队埋下的一连串地雷。一阵猛烈的爆炸，美国鬼子一下子躺倒了十七个，其他的都嚎叫着连滚带爬逃回去了。埋伏在山上的解放武装力量的战士们看到美国鬼子的这种狼狈相，个个暗自发笑。
    到了下午两时，两个连的美国鬼子在十辆坦克的掩护下才开进了拜山村。他们闯进村子后到处胡乱开枪，可是最后发现村子里连个人影也没有。那时，雨越下越大了，美国鬼子急忙选了个地方扎起营来。
    等美国鬼子刚刚把营扎好，解放武装力量的指挥员就一声令下，四周山上的所有轻重武器一齐向敌阵猛烈开火。一阵阵迫击炮弹迅速摧毁了敌人的许多辆坦克，轻重机枪的猛烈的火舌更打得敌人东歪西倒，伤亡惨重。附近据点里的敌人急忙派出飞机进行轰炸扫射，企图掩护被围困在村子里的美国侵略军突围出去，但是又被解放武装力量战士们当场击落两架。经过一个多小时的激烈战斗，解放武装力量在给予这两个连的四百多名敌人以歼灭性的打击以后，就迅速撤出了战斗。
    异军突起  摧枯拉朽
    在遭到这一沉重打击以后，敌人又是恐慌，又是恼怒，到处寻找解放武装力量，但是连一个人影也找不到。不料，三天后，解放武装力量突然兵临城下，对胡溪山以及附近几个高地上的美国海军陆战队阵地发起了猛烈袭击。解放武装力量的炮兵部队首先对五六高地上的敌人阵地进行了密集的轰击，美军炮兵阵地还来不及回击就被全部摧毁。在强大炮火掩护下，第二分队分队长杨文省率领的一个尖刀组冲在前面，接连摧毁敌人的坦克两辆，为战斗开辟了胜利的道路。排长阮长青虽然腿部负了伤，仍然带领同志们奋勇冲入敌阵，用手榴弹和刺刀消灭了几十个敌人。经过短时间的激烈战斗，战士们迅速地攻占了五六高地上的敌军阵地。
    接着，战士们又猛攻胡溪山和六七高地上的敌军阵地。解放武装力量的炮兵部队再次发挥了威力，打得敌人阵地上一片混乱。战士们在强大火力的支援下迅速突破了敌人的阵地，同敌人展开了激烈的近战。最后，敌人纷纷连滚带爬逃下山去，连敌人的坦克手也丢掉了坦克仓惶逃命。
    这两次战斗，一共消灭美国侵略军九百人，摧毁敌人坦克三十辆。（据新华社讯）
