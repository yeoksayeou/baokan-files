Spanish Workers Observe Anti-Fascist Struggle Day

Spanish workers recently held a nationwide day of struggle to protest against the fascist policies of the Franco dictatorship, to protest against rising prices, and to demand wage increases. This strike was held despite the numerous threats and sabotage attempts by the Franco reactionary government. In Madrid, workers in many factories went on strike, held demonstrations, and organized protest rallies.

Students at the University of Madrid also held demonstrations to express their support for the workers' struggle.

French Workers Launch Fight Against Unemployment

The struggle of French workers to demand wage increases and fight against unemployment is intensifying across the country. In the capital of Sarthe Province, Le Mans, several thousand workers of the Renault automobile company defied police orders and recently held a demonstration to demand wage increases. Police, in an attempt to prevent the workers from marching, set up barbed wire on major streets and released a large quantity of tear gas. The demonstrators retaliated fiercely with bottles and stones against the police who came to suppress them. The battle lasted for five hours. Fifty workers were arrested by the police.

At the same time, workers in other factories and enterprises in Le Mans also held demonstrations.

Workers in Many Peruvian Cities Go on Strike

Workers in many cities in Peru have recently gone on strike one after another to protest against the rising cost of living and to demand wage increases to maintain a basic standard of living. The latest wave of strikes began in mid-October in the country's second-largest city, Arequipa. Workers there launched a city-wide general strike to demand wage increases to offset the increase in living costs caused by currency devaluation. Following Arequipa, cities such as Cusco, Juliaca, and Puno also erupted in general strikes.
