The new immigrants' hotel Mao Zedong Thought study class will hold its opening ceremony tomorrow. Old worker Su Lianhai is so excited that he can't sleep. He thinks he has a lot to say, but he is also afraid that he has never spoken in front of so many people before, and he might get nervous and not be able to speak. After thinking it over, he decides to write a big character poster.

How to write it? Where to start?

Su Lianhai lies in bed, looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao, thinking deeply and widely. This is his habit; whenever something happens, he thinks this way.

Master Su thinks back to the days when he was an apprentice before liberation. Back then, under the capitalist's whip, he worked like an ox or a horse, never having enough to eat or wear, and when he lost his job, life was even harder. Liberation came, and Chairman Mao saved him from the fire, giving him a happy life. This time, calling him to the study class to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions is another expression of Chairman Mao's warm concern for him. The more he thinks about it, the more excited he gets.

Master Su also thinks back to the early days of the Cultural Revolution. One day, he heard on the radio that there was a top capitalist roader within the Party who was madly trying to restore capitalism. When he heard that they wanted to go back to the old ways, he was so angry he could burst. He made up his mind to fight to the end with those who wanted to restore capitalism. Later, he heard that the Red Guards were Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, specially organized to rebel against capitalism, revisionism, feudalism, and capitalist roaders within the Party. Master Su also signed up to join the Red Guards, firmly supporting the young rebels in their revolution. The top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were pulled down from their horses and became rats that everyone wanted to beat. Now, Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line," and Master Su is determined to carry it out. He thinks, capitalists are extremely selfish people. If we have selfish thoughts and don't expose and criticize them, letting them develop, won't we end up with hearts like capitalists? Master Su is determined to be a model in criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

Master Su thought a lot, but he wrote a very short big character poster. The poster reads:

	I am participating in the opening ceremony of the Mao Zedong Thought study class today, and classes will start tomorrow. This is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's concern for me. Thinking back to the days in the old society, working for the capitalists, I couldn't even guarantee my meals, let alone study? We workers' gratitude to Chairman Mao is to shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

The big character poster is short, and the language is simple, but it expresses the deep and sincere feelings of this old worker, who suffered greatly in the old society, for our great leader Chairman Mao!

    老工人的一张大字报
    新侨饭店毛泽东思想学习班明天就要举行开学典礼。老工人苏连海，高兴得睡不着觉，心想自己有很多话要说，又怕从来没有当着那么多人说过话，到时候一紧张，讲不出来。想来想去，还是决定写张大字报。
    怎么写呢？从哪里写起呢？
    苏连海躺在床上，两眼看着毛主席像，想得很远，很多。这是他的习惯，每当有了什么事，他总是这样。
    苏师傅想到解放前当学徒的年月。那时候，在资本家的皮鞭下，象牛马一样的干活，吃不饱，穿不暖，失了业，日子就更难过……。解放了，毛主席把他从火海里救出来，过上了幸福的生活。这一回叫他上学习班，活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，这又是毛主席对他的亲切关怀。他越想心里越激动。
    苏师傅又想到文化大革命初期的事情。有一天，从收音机里听到，党内有个最大的走资派，疯狂地想搞资本主义复辟。他一听到要走回头路，真是气炸了肺。他下定决心，要和那搞资本主义复辟的人拚到底。后来，听说红卫兵就是毛主席指挥的红小兵，专造资本主义、修正主义、封建主义和党内走资派的反，苏师傅也报名参加红卫兵，坚决支持红卫兵小将们造反。党内最大的一小撮走资派被拉下马了，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。现在，毛主席又发出了“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，苏连海老师傅决心坚决照办。他想，资本家都是极端自私自利的人，如果我们有私心，不亮不斗，让它发展下去，不是会变成和资本家的心肠一样了吗？苏师傅决心在斗私批修中做模范。
    苏师傅想了很多很多，却写了一张很短的大字报。大字报是这样的：
    我今天参加毛泽东思想学习班开学典礼，明天就上课。这是共产党毛主席对我的关怀，想起在万恶的旧社会给资本家做工时，吃饭都保不住，哪还能学习呢？我们工人阶级对毛主席的感谢，就是高呼：毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
                              苏连海
                                    十月三十日
    大字报很短，语言很朴实，但却表现出这位在旧社会饱经苦难的老工人，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴心情，是多么的炽烈，多么的真挚！
