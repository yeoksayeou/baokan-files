Chairman Mao said: "Everything should be done according to the principle of thrift." However, some comrades in our unit believe that revolution cannot be done with thrift, saying that we should calculate political accounts and not economic accounts, and that spending more money during the Cultural Revolution is inevitable.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we analyzed thrift and waste, making everyone understand that thrift in revolution is not just about saving a few dollars, but more importantly, it is about uprooting the roots of revisionism in our minds. This is the greatest "political account."

After the analysis, everyone realized the great significance of thrift in revolution and paid attention to thrift in every aspect. Originally, some comrades wrote big-character posters and slogans using good paper and large sheets, but later they used rough paper and old newspapers from the warehouse. Cars and propaganda vehicles, which were originally controlled for use, were later completely banned. Everyone not only took the lead in thrift but also supervised each other. Administrative and financial comrades also tightened the controls and plugged some loopholes for waste.

These things may seem small, but when accumulated, the amount saved is significant. This year, we did not spend any state funds to purchase new items. Compared to the same period last year, office expenses decreased by 18%, water and electricity fees decreased by 28%, and gasoline expenses decreased by 87%. This is not just a simple percentage, but the result of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking!

    这是最大的政治账
    毛主席说：“什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。”可是，我们单位有的同志却认为搞革命不能讲节约，说什么要算政治账，不要算经济账，搞文化大革命多用几个钱是难免的。
    我们遵照毛主席的教导，对节约和浪费进行了分析，使大家认识到：节约闹革命不仅是为了少用几个钱，更重要的是为了从思想上挖掉修正主义的根子，这是最大的“政治账”。
    经过分析，大家认识到节约闹革命的重大意义，处处注意节约。原来有的同志写大字报、标语，要用好纸、大纸，后来就用仓库里积压的粗纸、废报纸；小汽车和宣传车，原来是控制使用，后来一律禁止使用。大家不但自己带头节约，还互相监督。行政和财会方面的同志也注意把紧关口，堵塞一些浪费漏洞。
    这些事看来都很小，但积累起来，节约的数字却很大。今年我们没有用国家的钱添置一件用具。上半年与去年同期比较，办公用费下降了百分之十八，水电费下降百分之二十八，汽油费下降了百分之八十七。这不是一个简单的百分比，而是战无不胜的毛泽东思想促进人们思想革命化的成果！
