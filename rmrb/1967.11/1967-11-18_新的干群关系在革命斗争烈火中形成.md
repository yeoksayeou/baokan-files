New Relationships Between Cadres and the Masses Formed in the Fiery Struggle of the Revolution

Editor's Note: How can cadres who have made mistakes quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? The experience of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant tells us: Cadres must go to the fiery struggle of the masses to be tempered and tested, and fight against selfishness and revisionism together with the masses to thoroughly cleanse their minds of erroneous thoughts, thereby raising their proletarian consciousness. Only in this way can the masses truly recognize them and regain their trust and support.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," and also says, "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most capable are the most experienced fighters." However, some of our cadres have forgotten Chairman Mao's teachings. Over the years, they have become arrogant, thinking they are great because they have become officials. They act haughtily, do not consult with the masses on matters, treat people unequally, and like to scold others. The result is that they have seriously alienated themselves from the masses, even executing the bourgeois reactionary line and committing serious errors.

To seriously learn from this lesson, it is not enough to adopt the method of "reflecting in solitude." One must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go among the masses, blend with them, and in work "persist in the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be a student of the masses," earnestly improving the relationship with the masses.

The Shanghai Third Steel Plant established a revolutionary committee in late September, with the original plant director Chen Dasheng serving as the chairman. Chen Dasheng made many mistakes during his tenure as plant director and party committee secretary over the years, some of which were serious. For example, he implemented the revisionist enterprise line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai; at the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he also implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. However, looking at his entire career and history, his fundamental principles are good. In his long-term revolutionary work, he has been diligent and responsible. As long as he is sincerely helped, he can return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

High Temperatures Forge Good Steel

How to help Chen Dasheng recognize and correct his mistakes? Chen Dasheng, although he has made many self-examinations, always "reflects in solitude" and cannot correct his mistakes. The proletarian revolutionary comrades of this plant believe that to rescue Chen Dasheng from his mistakes, he must be placed in the fiery struggle of the masses, through mass exposure and criticism, to deeply touch his soul, so that he can truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They vividly metaphorically say: High temperatures forge good steel! The capitalist and revisionist poison in Chen Dasheng's mind is like impurities in molten steel, which must be burned away through the fiery struggle of the masses.

Chen Dasheng participated in nearly thirty large and small criticism meetings. A large amount of facts and serious criticism made him deeply shocked. After intense ideological struggle, he began to realize the seriousness of his mistakes.

After the criticism meetings, revolutionary comrades helped him study Chairman Mao's works, helping him truly understand what is the socialist road, what is the capitalist road, what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and what is the bourgeois reactionary line. This help greatly raised his level of Mao Zedong Thought, further promoting his self-awareness to fight against selfishness and consciously revolutionize. On the basis of gradually raising his ideological awareness, Chen Dasheng made several self-examinations. The masses were generally satisfied during the discussions in various workshops.

During the process of being criticized, Chen Dasheng was assigned to work in the revolutionary production command post. He accepted the criticism of the masses while actively completing his work tasks. As soon as a criticism meeting ended, he would put on a safety helmet and go to the workshop. In one criticism meeting, the broad revolutionary masses used a large amount of facts to expose and criticize his mistake of pursuing production profits one-sidedly and not valuing the human factor. After the meeting, he actively went to the workshop to check his mistakes with the worker comrades and, at the same time, mobilized everyone to study and improve measures together. Revolutionary masses said: "Large and small criticism meetings are the process of our recognizing Chen Dasheng, and also the process of Chen Dasheng's 'revealing himself.' This lays a good foundation for the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination.'"

A Struggle of Selflessness and Public Spirit

After Chen Dasheng entered the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, how should his work be arranged? Should he be a committee member or the first-in-command? This was a much-debated issue. Some people thought: "Since Chen Dasheng has returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, he can be the first-in-command." Others thought: "Chen Dasheng was the first-in-command of the original Shanghai Third Steel Plant. Now, if he is to be the first-in-command, is it not giving him power back?" Still, others worried: "'Once power is in hand, orders are issued,' if Chen Dasheng becomes the first-in-command, will he retaliate against the revolutionary faction?" Chen Dasheng himself was not very willing to be the first-in-command. He thought: "Being the first-in-command is too risky. In the future, when movements arise, I will be the first target of criticism." Ultimately, it is a matter of "selfishness" at play. Therefore, whether it was the revolutionary faction or Chen Dasheng, a struggle between public and private interests was laid out before them.

The comrades from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the plant helped them organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class, organizing the revolutionary faction and Chen Dasheng to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and relevant instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, helping them reveal their thoughts and fight against selfishness. Through fighting selfishness, the proletarian revolutionary faction realized: Our purpose in rising up in revolution is not to become officials. This power is given to us by Chairman Mao and the people. Whoever holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high, whoever holds power is most beneficial to the people and the Party's cause, we support and believe in him. Since Chen Dasheng has resolutely returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he should be boldly used. Fear of losing power and fear of retaliation are manifestations of selfishness.

Chen Dasheng, under the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and revolutionary comrades, through the practical application of the "Three Constantly Read Articles," fought against selfish thoughts, raising his ideological awareness. He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us to be selfless and dedicated, to take on heavy burdens. But why do I think of myself first when faced with a task? This shows I have selfish thoughts. I must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly and consciously fight against selfishness and revisionism, daring to take on heavy burdens, and achieve new merits for the people."

At the same time, the revolutionary faction went deep into workshops and teams to listen to the opinions of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. Many workers unanimously said: "For revolutionary cadres like Chen Dasheng, since he has recognized his mistakes and corrected them, truly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, he should be allowed to serve as the first-in-command." This further solidified their belief in letting Chen Dasheng serve as the first-in-command.

New Type of Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses

After Chen Dasheng became the first-in-command, he was still somewhat hesitant and not daring to lead boldly. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army stationed in the plant and the leaders of the revolutionary faction discovered this problem and immediately pointed out: Since he is to be the first-in-command, he must be trusted, supported, and encouraged to boldly take on work. Otherwise, combining but not using him boldly is not a true "three-in-one combination." Therefore, they educated the revolutionary comrades to support Chen Dasheng on one hand, and on the other hand, they focused on doing ideological work with Chen Dasheng, encouraging him to bravely take on the revolutionary burden. The leaders of the revolutionary faction also supported Chen Dasheng with practical actions, such as actively taking on some administrative tasks for him, allowing him to focus on considering and handling major issues of the entire plant.

Under the help of the comrades from the People's Liberation Army stationed in the plant and the revolutionary faction, Chen Dasheng fought against selfishness and revisionism, learning the revolutionary spirit and fighting style of daring to think, speak, act, and take responsibility from the revolutionary faction, consciously taking on heavy burdens. He also used his own mistakes to educate new revolutionary cadres. When he found that a workshop director was focusing too much on production and not enough on studying Chairman Mao's works, he earnestly told him: "Production is tight, but focusing only on production is not good. As the main responsible person, at any time, you must focus on studying Chairman Mao's works, emphasize politics, and promote the ideological transformation of people. Only in this way can you do a good job in production and all other work. Otherwise, you will lose your direction. I made this mistake in the past." Later, this comrade actively focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, and the masses responded positively.

Chen Dasheng insisted on working one day a week and often went deep into workshops and teams, studying Chairman Mao's works with the broad masses of workers and discussing how to grasp revolution and promote production.

    新的干群关系在革命斗争烈火中形成
    上钢三厂原厂长参加革委会过程中正确解决和群众的关系
    编者按：犯了错误的干部，怎样才能迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来？
    上钢三厂的经验告诉我们：干部必须到群众斗争的烈火中去经受锻炼和考验，和群众一起斗私批修，狠触自己的灵魂。只有这样，才能彻底清除头脑里的错误思想，提高自己的无产阶级觉悟；才能让群众真正识别自己，并且重新取得群众的信任和支持。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，又说，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”可是，我们的有些干部，忘记了毛主席的教导。这些年来，自以为官做大了，自以为了不起，就摆架子，有事不跟群众商量，不平等待人，喜欢训人。其结果是，严重脱离了群众，甚至执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了严重的错误。
    要认真吸取这个教训，绝不是采取“闭门思过”的办法所能做到的，必须遵照毛主席的教导，到群众里面去，和群众打成一片，在工作中“坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”，认真地搞好同群众的关系。
    上海第三钢铁厂在九月下旬成立了革命委员会，原厂长陈大同担任革命委员会主任委员。陈大同在先后担任厂长和党委书记的十几年中，犯过许多错误，有些错误甚至是严重的。例如，他执行过中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人所推行的修正主义办企业路线；无产阶级文化大革命初期，又执行了资产阶级反动路线。但是，从他的全部工作和历史来看，他的大节还是好的。在长期的革命工作中，他基本上是勤勤恳恳、积极负责的。只要热情地加以帮助，他是能够回到毛主席的革命路线上来的。
    高温才能炼好钢
    怎样帮助陈大同认识并改正错误呢？陈大同对自己的错误，虽然做过多次检查，但老是“闭门思过”，始终改不掉。这个厂的无产阶级革命派同志认为，要想把陈大同从错误中挽救过来，必须把他放到群众斗争的烈火中去，通过群众性的揭发、批判，狠触灵魂，才能使他真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们非常形象地比喻说：高温炼好钢嘛！陈大同脑子里的资本主义、修正主义毒素，就象钢水里的杂质一样，必须通过群众斗争的烈火，才能烧掉。
    陈大同先后参加了将近三十次的大小批判会。大量的事实，严肃的批判，使他触目惊心。经过激烈的思想斗争，他开始认识到自己错误的严重性。
    批判会后，革命派同志又和他一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他真正认识到什么是社会主义道路，什么是资本主义道路，什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线。这种帮助，大大提高了他的毛泽东思想水平，进一步促使他狠斗私心，自觉革命。在思想觉悟逐步提高的基础上，陈大同先后做了数次检查。各车间讨论时，群众都比较满意。
    在受批判的过程中，陈大同被分配在抓革命促生产第一线指挥部工作。他一面接受群众的批判，一面积极完成工作任务。批判会一开完，他就戴起安全帽到车间去。一次批判会上，广大革命群众用大量事实揭发、批判了他片面追求生产利润、不重视人的因素的错误。会后，他主动到车间去向工人同志检查错误，同时发动大家一起研究改进措施。革命群众说：“大大小小的批判会，是我们识别陈大同的过程，也是陈大同本人‘亮相’的过程。”这就给革命的“三结合”打下了良好的基础。
    一场破私立公的斗争
    陈大同进入“三结合”临时权力机构以后，工作如何安排？是当委员还是当第一把手？这是大家争论比较多的问题。有人认为：“陈大同既然已经回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了，就可以当第一把手”。有人却认为：“陈大同是原上钢三厂的第一把手，现在要他担任第一把手，是不是把权还给他了？”还有人担心：“‘一朝权在手，便把令来行’，陈大同当了第一把手，会不会对革命派打击报复？”而陈大同自己也不大愿意当第一把手。他认为：“担任第一把手，风险太大，将来搞起运动来，又是首当其冲，是第一个批判对象。”归根结底，一个“私”字在作怪。因此，不管是革命派还是陈大同，一场公与私的斗争摆在面前。
    解放军某部驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，帮助他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，组织革命派和陈大同一起学习“老三篇”和毛主席、党中央的有关指示，帮助他们亮思想，斗私心。通过斗私，无产阶级革命派认识到：我们起来革命的目的，不是为了当官。我们这个权是毛主席给的，人民给的。毛泽东思想伟大红旗谁举得高，谁掌权对人民最有利，对党的事业最有利，我们就拥护他，相信他。陈大同既然坚决地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就应该大胆使用他。怕失权，怕报复，是私字作怪。
    陈大同本人在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革命派同志帮助下，通过活学活用“老三篇”，狠斗私心杂念，提高了思想觉悟。他说：“毛主席教导我们，要毫不利己专门利人，担子拣重的挑。可是我为什么一事当前，先想到自己呢？这说明我有私心杂念，我一定按照毛主席的教导，不断地自觉地斗私批修，勇于挑重担，为人民立新功。”
    同时，革命派分头深入车间、班组，听取广大革命群众和革命干部的意见。许多工人异口同声地说：“象陈大同这样的革命干部，既然认识了错误，能知过改过，真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就应该让他担任第一把手。”这就更坚定了他们让陈大同担任第一把手的信念。
    新型的干群关系
    陈大同担任第一把手以后，开始还有些缩手缩脚，不敢大胆领导。驻厂解放军同志和革命派负责人发现这个问题后，立即指出：既然要他担任第一把手，就要信任他，支持他，鼓励他大胆放手工作，否则，结合而不放手使用，就不是真正的“三结合”。于是，他们一方面教育革命派同志支持陈大同；一方面抓紧对陈大同做思想工作，鼓励他勇敢地挑起革命担子。革命派负责人还用实际行动支持陈大同，如主动地替他分担一些事务性工作，让他抽出身来考虑和处理全厂重大事宜。
    陈大同在驻厂解放军同志和革命派帮助下斗私批修，学习革命派敢想、敢说、敢干、敢于负责的革命精神和战斗风格，自觉地挑起重担。他还用自己犯错误的教训教育革命的新干部。他发现一个车间负责人对生产抓得较紧，对毛主席著作学习抓得不够时，就语重心长地对他说：“生产紧是事实，但是就生产抓生产是抓不好的。作为主要负责人，任何时候，都要抓好毛主席著作的学习，突出政治，搞好人的思想革命化，只有这样，才能搞好生产和各项工作。否则，就会迷失方向。我过去就是犯了这方面的错误。”后来，这位同志积极抓毛主席著作学习，群众反映很好。
    陈大同坚持每星期劳动一天，平时还经常深入车间、班组，和广大职工共同研究学习毛主席著作和抓革命、促生产等问题。　本报记者（附图片）
    上钢三厂无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆地解放干部，实行革命的“三结合”。原上钢三厂厂长陈大同（左二）担任厂革命委员会第一把手后，突出无产阶级政治，大力组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，同全厂革命职工一起以“斗私，批修”为纲，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，为完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务而奋斗。　新华社记者　郑震孙摄
