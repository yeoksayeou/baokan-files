Arab opinion points out that one cannot rely on the United Nations to solve the Middle East problem. One must engage in resolute struggle to defeat the aggressors. The Arab people will no longer be fooled by the United States and those who surrender to the United States.

	New China News Agency, November 23rd: Arab opinion points out that the Arab people cannot place their hopes in the United Nations. Resolute and tenacious struggle is the only path for the Arab people to achieve liberation.

	The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* recently published an editorial stating that many events in the United Nations have proven that colonialism is continuing to attack the Arab people. The Arab people will no longer be fooled by the United States and those who attempt to surrender to the United States. The Arab people have never placed their hopes in the "conscience" of US imperialism or in international conferences. The Arab people will never take the path of defeatism and surrender.

	Another Syrian newspaper, *Al-Thawra*, published an editorial stating that the only path to liberation is resolute struggle. The only language that US imperialism understands is the resolute struggle adopted by the heroic Vietnamese people.

	The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Nil* said that the United Nations has supported the aggressors and has shaken hands with the murderers, kissing their blood-stained butcher knives.

	The Sudanese newspaper *Al-Ra'y al-'Amm* said that the United Nations does not condemn Israel's aggression, and this is not an isolated incident because the United Nations will not condemn aggression. This newspaper said that for a long time, the United Nations has yielded to American political pressure. The United States has used the United Nations to attack Korea, interfere in the national revolution of the Congo (Kinshasa), and refuse to restore the legal rights of the People's Republic of China, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population. The newspaper concluded by saying that those who shout "prudence," "non-adventurism," and exaggerate the enemy's strength are defeatists who attempt to persuade us to acknowledge the imperialist tool, Israel. The newspaper emphasized that the only path the Arab people can take is to mobilize the masses and prepare for a long war until they achieve complete victory.

	The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shukairy, recently said: "The United Nations cannot achieve a political solution to the Palestinian problem because the United Nations is a place for conspiracy activities." He also said: "The liberation of Palestine can only be achieved through armed struggle, not through speeches at the United Nations."

	The Sudanese Minister of Defense, Adam Mahmoud Musa Madibbo, recently stated in a declaration: Arab countries should not rely on the United Nations to seek a solution to the Middle East crisis. He pointed out that Arab countries must solve the Middle East crisis through military action, and military action is necessary to recover the Arab territories that have been occupied.

    阿拉伯舆论指出决不能指望美帝工具联合国解决中东问题
    必须进行坚决斗争打败侵略者
    阿拉伯人民再也不上美国和那些投降美国人的当
    新华社二十三日讯　阿拉伯舆论指出，阿拉伯人民不能把希望寄托在联合国，坚决顽强的斗争是阿拉伯人民获得解放的唯一道路。
    叙利亚《复兴报》最近发表一篇社论说，在联合国所发生的许多事情证明，殖民主义在继续进攻阿拉伯人民。阿拉伯人民再也不上美国和那些企图向美国投降的人的当了。阿拉伯人民从来没有把希望寄托在美帝国主义的“良心”发现和国际会议上。阿拉伯人民决不会走上失败主义和投降的道路。
    叙利亚的另一家报纸《革命报》发表社论说，争取解放的唯一道路是坚决斗争。美帝国主义唯一懂得的语言是英雄的越南人民所采取的坚决斗争。
    苏丹的《尼罗河报》说，联合国支持了侵略者，并且同杀人犯握手，吻他们的血淋淋的屠刀。
    苏丹的《舆论报》说，联合国不谴责以色列的侵略，这并不是个别的事例，因为联合国不会谴责侵略。这家报纸说，长期以来，联合国一直屈服于美国的政治压力，美国利用联合国进攻朝鲜，干涉刚果（金）的民族革命，以及拒不恢复占世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。报纸最后说，那些叫喊“明智”、“非冒险主义”和夸大敌人力量的人，是失败主义者，他们企图说服我们承认帝国主义工具以色列。报纸强调说，阿拉伯人民所能采取的唯一道路，是动员群众和准备长期战争，直到取得完全胜利。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里最近说：“联合国不可能对巴勒斯坦问题求得政治解决，因为联合国是进行阴谋活动的场所。”他还说：“巴勒斯坦的解放，只能通过武装斗争的道路来实现，而不能通过在联合国发表演说来实现。”
    苏丹国防部长阿丹·马哈茂德·穆萨·马迪博最近在他发表的一篇声明中说：阿拉伯国家不应该依靠联合国来寻求解决中东危机的办法。他指出，阿拉伯各国必须通过军事行动来解决中东危机，而军事行动是收复阿拉伯被占领的领土所必需的。
