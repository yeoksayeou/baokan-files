The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy. So far, out of more than 700 cadres at various levels in the entire company, 85% have been liberated, and many cadres have taken up leadership positions.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taken "criticize and rectify oneself, criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They have boldly liberated and used cadres, helped cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, broken down the "private" character, and established the "public" character, daring to shoulder the revolutionary burden. So far, out of more than 700 cadres at various levels in the entire company, 85% have been liberated; out of the 18 units under the company, nine units have liberated 90% of their cadres; ten units have achieved a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," establishing revolutionary committees. Nearly 50% of the members of the revolutionary committees are revolutionary cadres, and most of them serve as chairmen of the revolutionary committees. Revolutionary leading cadres from three companies have been elected into the "three-in-one combination" leadership teams.

In the struggle against "private" interests, cadres are boldly liberated

Are most cadres good or bad? At the beginning, there were differences of opinion within the proletarian revolutionary faction:

Some comrades said: The Beijing Municipal Transportation Company has a "special situation," most cadres have implemented the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee in managing enterprises, and during the Cultural Revolution, they have implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, these comrades believed that there were not many good cadres. Some comrades were unwilling to do ideological work for cadres, fearing that the "conservative" hat would fall on their own heads. In response to these active thoughts, the PLA comrades stationed in the company repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres" and "not only looking at a cadre's one-time or one-event actions, but also looking at the cadre's entire history and entire work." After repeated discussions, everyone realized that most cadres in the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company love Chairman Mao, have done a lot of work over the past ten or several decades, and their achievements are the main aspect. Some have resisted the revisionist line, and some have implemented the revisionist line because they were influenced by Liu Shaoqi's theory of "tame tools." In this way, everyone established the idea of "believing in and relying on the majority of cadres" and had the determination to liberate cadres.

However, in the specific work of liberating cadres, some comrades still had difficulties understanding. Some comrades said: "A certain person implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the past, suppressing us to the point where we couldn't breathe, and we have just turned over. How can we let them rise again!" Some comrades said: "We have struggled against some cadres who made serious mistakes in the past, and if we let them rise again, they will give us a hard time, and we won't be able to bear it!" In response to these ideological problems, the PLA comrades continued to help everyone establish the great spirit of the proletariat not only liberating themselves but also liberating all mankind. If the proletariat cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated. They guided everyone to recognize that after this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most cadres have raised their political awareness, will follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and perform new feats in the great criticism; they will remove the political dust from their bodies after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and improve their relationship with the masses. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary faction should enthusiastically educate and unite the majority of cadres, and for those who have made serious mistakes but are not stubborn and unrepentant, they should insist on implementing the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient." With the help of the PLA comrades, everyone decided to do the work of educating cadres. The Fourth Automobile Transport Factory has 45 cadres, and many of them implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the movement, causing a serious confrontation with the masses. The proletarian revolutionary faction organized cadres to study "Investigation Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and the "Three Articles," helping revolutionary cadres recognize their past mistakes. Now, most cadres have been liberated. In the Sixth Workshop, there was a deputy secretary of the party committee who implemented the revisionist line of managing the workshop before the Cultural Revolution; at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he deceived some masses to leave the workshop, seriously affecting the revolution and production. The revolutionary masses criticized him and once proposed to overthrow him. Through studying Chairman Mao's cadre policy, they reanalyzed his mistakes comprehensively and realized that this cadre had been active in his work in the past, only because he did not understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the great significance of the Cultural Revolution at that time, he made mistakes. The revolutionary faction should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, unite and educate him. Therefore, he was allowed to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and "criticize and rectify oneself, criticize and repudiate revisionism" together with the revolutionary faction. This cadre was very moved and sincerely examined his mistakes. When the revolutionary committee was established in the Sixth Workshop, he was elected into the "three-in-one combination" leadership team.

In the struggle against "private" interests, cadres are boldly used

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this company believes that not only should revolutionary cadres be boldly liberated, but they should also be boldly used. However, some comrades said: "It's good enough that you are liberated, and now you want to lead me?" "I liberated you, you have to listen to me, and I have to be the head of the family!"

Who should be the head of the family? The PLA comrades believe that on the issue of "power," this is a big problem of whether to let "public" interests be in charge or let "private" interests be in charge. Therefore, they organized the revolutionary faction to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's statements on "after the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor" and "the Communist Party of China is a party leading a great revolutionary struggle in a nation of tens of millions of people, without a majority of morally and intellectually outstanding leading cadres, it cannot complete its historical mission," guiding everyone to fight against "private" interests, break down petty-bourgeois factionalism, establish proletarian party spirit, to grasp the power of the proletariat, not the power of individuals or small groups. These comrades realized that their previous views were "factionalism," "revolutionary individualism," "selfishness," etc., and were the result of "private" interests. A deputy manager and a deputy secretary of the party committee of the Beijing Municipal Transportation Company are both cadres who have been tempered for a long time, and during the Cultural Revolution, they stood on the side of the rebels. Most comrades believed that they should be elected into the "three-in-one combination" leadership team. However, some comrades disagreed, believing that "if they are in charge, where do we put ourselves?" The PLA comrades helped the proletarian revolutionary faction to eliminate "private" interests, recognizing that although they had implemented the revisionist line of managing enterprises, they still had some resistance. Now, these two cadres have been elected into the "three-in-one combination" leadership team.

    勇于斗私批修　勇于解放干部
    北京市运输公司无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，到目前为止，全公司七百多名各级干部中已解放百分之八十五，很多干部担任了领导职务
    本报讯　北京市运输公司的无产阶级革命派，在解放军的帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆解放干部，大胆使用干部，帮助干部活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，勇敢挑起革命重担。到目前为止，全公司七百多名各级领导干部中，已解放百分之八十五；公司所属十八个单位，有九个单位解放干部达百分之九十；有十个单位实现了革命“三结合”，成立了革命委员会。革命委员会的成员中，革命干部将近百分之五十，大部分担任革命委员会主任。三个公司的革命领导干部被选进了“三结合”的领导班子。
        在斗“私”中大胆解放干部
    干部大多数是好的，还是坏的？开始，无产阶级革命派内部有分歧：
    有些同志说：运输公司“情况特殊”，大部分干部执行了旧北京市委的修正主义办企业路线，在文化大革命中又执行了资产阶级反动路线。因此这些同志认为没有几个干部是好的。有的同志不愿作干部的思想工作，怕“保皇派”帽子落在自己头上。针对这些活思想，驻公司的解放军同志，反复宣传毛主席关于“要相信和依靠干部的大多数”，“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导。经过反复讨论，大家认识到运输公司干部的大多数是热爱毛主席的，在十几年或几十年中作了不少工作，成绩是主要的。有的对修正主义路线有所抵制，有的是因为受了中国赫鲁晓夫
  “驯服工具”论的影响才执行修正主义路线的。这样，大家树立起了“要相信和依靠干部的大多数”的思想，有了解放干部的决心。
    但是在解放干部的具体工作中，还有一些同志一时想不通。有的同志说：“某人过去执行资产阶级反动路线，压得我们喘不过气来，好容易翻过身来了，怎么也不能让他们再起来！”有的同志说：“我们前一段时间对某些犯错误的干部进行了斗争，要是再让他们起来，会给咱们穿小鞋，受不了！”针对这些思想问题，解放军又继续帮助大家树立“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放”的伟大胸怀，引导大家认清，大多数干部经过这场无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，政治觉悟更加提高了，会紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命的大批判中立新功；他们经过无产阶级文化大革命，去掉了身上的政治灰尘，会改进自己同群众的关系。因此，无产阶级革命派要热情地教育和团结干部的大多数，对于犯了严重错误的干部只要不是坚持不改和屡教不改的，都要坚持实行“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针。经过解放军同志帮助，大家都决心来做教育干部的工作。汽车运输四厂共有干部四十五名，不少人在运动初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，造成了与群众严重对立的情况。无产阶级革命派的同志组织干部学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》和“老三篇”，帮助革命干部认识了过去的错误。现在大多数干部都解放出来了。六场有个党委副书记，文化大革命前执行修正主义办场路线；文化大革命开始后蒙蔽一部分群众离场，严重影响了抓革命促生产。革命群众对他进行了批判，曾经提出要打倒他的口号。通过学习毛主席的干部政策，重新全面地分析了他的错误，认识到这个干部过去工作积极，只是因为一时不理解毛主席的革命路线和文化大革命的伟大意义，才犯了错误。革命派应该按照毛主席的指示办事，团结、教育他。因此让他参加了毛泽东思想学习班，和革命派一起“斗私，批修”。这个干部很受感动，诚恳地检查了自己的错误。六场成立革命委员会时，他被选入“三结合”领导班子。
              在斗“私”中大胆使用干部
    这个公司的无产阶级革命派认为，不但要大胆解放革命干部，而且要大胆使用革命干部。但是有少数同志说：“解放你就不错了，还让你领导我？”“是我把你解放的，你得听我的，这个家得我当！”
    到底这个家让谁当？解放军同志认为，在“权”字问题上，这是一个让“公”字当家，还是让“私”字当家的大问题。于是就组织革命派学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素”和“中国共产党是在一个几万万人的大民族中领导伟大革命斗争的党，没有多数才德兼备的领导干部，是不能完成其历史任务的”等论述，引导大家狠斗“私”字，大破小资产阶级派性，树立无产阶级党性，要掌无产阶级的权，不要掌个人或小团体的权。这些同志认识到，原先那种看法是“派性”，是“唯我独革”、“利己主义”等，是“私”字作怪。运输公司一个副经理和一个党委副书记，都是经过长期锻炼的干部，在文化大革命中又站在造反派一边。大部分同志认为要把他们选入“三结合”领导班子。但是也有一部分同志不同意，认为“他们做领导，我们往那放？”解放军同志帮助无产阶级革命派斗掉了“私”字，认识到虽然他们执行过修正主义办企业路线，但他们仍然有所抵制。现在这两个干部已被选入“三结合”领导班子。
