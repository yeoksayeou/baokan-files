The reactionary Ne Win government in Burma, which launched a nationwide anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign in late June, had been planning and meticulously preparing for this for a long time. After Ne Win, the fascist leader of the Burmese reactionary government, secretly met with the head of American imperialism, Johnson, in Washington in September last year, the government took the open and aggressive path of anti-China actions.

The Ne Win reactionary government's turn to anti-China policies is based on its domestic and foreign policy needs. Furthermore, it attempts to use anti-China sentiment to obstruct the unprecedented influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong in Burma. When the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution exposed China's Khrushchev, Ne Win could not help but lament, saying that he had lost the intermediary connecting him with China, and further accelerated his anti-China steps.

The Ne Win clique, in order to carry out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, first spread anti-China propaganda. Ne Win himself, at the second annual conference of the Burmese "Socialist Programme Party" held in November last year, jumped out to slander the great People's Republic of China, shouting that "China is the main enemy of Burma." At this meeting, the Ne Win clique openly determined anti-China as its basic policy.

Since the beginning of this year, the Ne Win reactionary government has taken a series of anti-China and hostile actions towards China in Sino-Burmese relations. During the negotiations to sign a new Sino-Burmese trade agreement, the Burmese reactionary government insisted on deleting the phrase "Sino-Burmese friendship" from the draft agreement, which was included in past agreements. On February 6, Chinese experts sent a representative to the Soviet embassy to protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists in Moscow against Chinese students passing through, Burmese foreign ministry officials immediately summoned the Chinese chargé d'affaires to attack the actions of the Chinese experts, saying that they were "not just." The official newspapers of Burma, such as the *People's Voice* and the *Guardian*, also openly provoked the Chinese people, repeatedly referring to the Kuomintang bandits as the "Kuomintang China."

The Ne Win reactionary government openly colluded with the Indian reactionary government, supporting the Indian reactionary government's evil plot to annex large tracts of Chinese territory. The northern end of the Burma-India border should traditionally be at the eastern end of the eastern segment of the Sino-Indian border. The Ne Win government signed a Burma-India border agreement with the Indian reactionary government in March. However, in the attached map, the northern end of the Burma-India border was extended northward into Chinese territory, all the way to the Dapu Pass. In fact, this placed the 90,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory that the Indian reactionary forces have long illegally occupied north of the eastern segment of the traditional Sino-Indian border and south of the illegal McMahon Line, according to the unreasonable demands of Indian expansionists, within Indian territory. After the Chinese government issued a serious warning to the Ne Win reactionary government, it still insisted on its reactionary stance against the Chinese people, exchanging the ratification documents of the agreement with the Indian reactionary government at the end of May.

In the first half of this year, the Ne Win reactionary government also openly dispatched troops and aircraft, repeatedly and seriously violating China's sacred territory and airspace.

The Ne Win fascist reactionary government's frenzied anti-China actions are a serious provocation to the great seven hundred million Chinese people. Since the Ne Win clique fired the first shot of anti-China actions, the Chinese people have the right to retaliate.

    大造反华舆论　进行周密策划　不断挑起事端
    奈温反动政府反华排华蓄谋已久
    据新华社二日讯　本社记者报道：缅甸奈温反动政府在六月底掀起的全国规模的反华排华逆流，是蓄谋已久和经过周密策划的。缅甸反动政府在它的法西斯总头目奈温去年九月到华盛顿朝拜美帝国主义头子约翰逊进行密商以后，就走上了公开猖狂反华的道路。
    奈温反动政府走上反华的道路是基于它在内政外交上的需要。此外，它还妄图以反华来阻挠史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响和战无不胜的毛泽东思想在缅甸的传播。当中国无产阶级文化大革命揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫以后，奈温情不自禁地发出哀鸣，说什么使他失去了同中国联系的牵线人，并进一步加快了反华步伐。
    奈温集团为了反华排华，首先大造反华舆论。奈温本人在去年十一月举行的缅甸“社会主义纲领党”第二次年会上，跳出来大肆诽谤伟大的中华人民共和国，叫嚷“中国是缅甸的主要敌人”。在这次会议上，奈温集团公然确定以反华作为它的基本政策。
    今年年初以来，奈温反动政府在中缅两国关系上，公然采取了一系列反华和敌视中国的行动。在中缅两国谈判签订新的中缅贸易协定时，缅甸反动政府坚持要求把协定草案中按照过去的协定提到“中缅友好”的字样删去。今年二月六日，中国援缅专家派出代表，到苏联大使馆抗议苏修在莫斯科红场殴打过境的中国留学生的法西斯暴行，缅甸外交部官员在事后立即约见中国大使馆临时代办，攻击中国专家的行动“不是正义的”。缅甸官方的《劳动人民报》、《卫报》等反动报纸还公然向中国人民挑衅，一再把蒋介石匪帮称为“国民党中国”。
    奈温反动政府公然同印度反动政府勾结，配合印度反动政府实现它妄图霸占大片中国领土的罪恶阴谋。缅印边界线的北端，本来应在中印边界东段传统习惯线的东端终点。奈温政府同印度反动政府在今年三月签订了缅印边界协定。在协定的附图中却把缅印边界线北端，向北延伸到中国境内，一直到底富山口，实际上就把中印边界东段传统习惯线以北、非法的麦克马洪线以南，印度反动派长期以来霸占的九万平方公里的中国领土，按照印度扩张主义者的无理要求，划为印度的领土。中国政府向奈温反动政府发出备忘录提出严重警告后，它仍然一意孤行，顽固坚持与中国人民为敌的反动立场，同印度反动政府在五月底交换了协定的批准书。
    在今年上半年，奈温反动政府还公然派遣军队和飞机，连续多次严重侵犯中国神圣的领土和领空。
    奈温法西斯反动政府疯狂反华是对伟大七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。由于奈温集团开了反华第一枪，中国人民就取得了还击的权利。
