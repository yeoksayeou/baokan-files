The head of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, Brezhnev, in his "report" at the Moscow "celebration of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution," began by shamelessly distorting the path of the October Revolution.

Brezhnev actually referred to the great October Socialist Revolution as the "October coup." He did not mention violent revolution, did not mention smashing the bourgeois state machine, did not mention replacing bourgeois dictatorship with proletarian dictatorship; instead, he maliciously talked about "accumulating a wealth of experience in various forms of struggle (legal and illegal, peaceful and non-peaceful, underground and open) in preparing for the October coup." The party was ready to quickly switch between these forms, and so on. This was actually a blatant denial that the victory of the October Revolution was a victory of violent revolution, a denial that the path of the October Revolution was the path of violent revolution.

In his book "Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," Lenin said: Kautsky used "a set of tricks" to make "the revolution disappear harmlessly." "Kautsky needed to use all kinds of evasions, sophistry, and fraudulent forgeries, precisely to avoid violent revolution, to cover up his betrayal of this revolution." The disciples of the traitor Kautsky, Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin, are also adept at playing this set of revisionist tricks.

In the past, Khrushchev's method was to directly falsify history, claiming that the October Revolution was "almost bloodless," "demonstrated magnanimity and humanity"; and according to the painstaking "research" of his group of hired "scholars," the cannon shot of the October Revolution, the cannon fired by the "Aurora" cruiser at the Winter Palace, was just a blank shot with no shells. Now, Brezhnev and Kosygin's gang twist and turn to describe the October Revolution as both "peaceful" and "non-peaceful," as a result of using "various means of struggle." Although the method is more cunning than Khrushchev's, the essence is the same. The fallacies of Khrushchev and his successors are all to cover up their betrayal of the October Revolution, to oppose violent revolution, to peddle the black goods of "peaceful transition," to help imperialism and reactionaries in various countries deal with revolutionary people.

The Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique, under the banner of "celebrating" the October Revolution, blatantly deny that the October Revolution is a great revolution in which the proletariat seizes power through revolutionary violence. This is a great insult to the great Lenin, a great insult to the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Soviet people, a great insult to the revolutionary forerunners who shed blood and sacrificed their lives to create the world's first proletarian dictatorship!

The world's proletariat and revolutionary people will never forget that on the eve of the October Revolution, Lenin repeatedly emphasized the need to educate the masses to understand: the proletarian state must replace the bourgeois state through violent revolution. He pointed out: "The bourgeois state being replaced by the proletarian state (proletarian dictatorship) cannot be achieved through 'self-dissolution,' according to general laws, it can only be achieved through violent revolution."

In July 1917, the counter-revolutionary Kerensky government suddenly struck at the revolution, and the streets of Petrograd were soaked with the blood of workers and soldiers. Under Lenin's guidance, the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik Party decided on the policy of armed uprising. Then, Lenin and the Bolshevik Party firmly led the workers and soldiers to carry out an armed uprising, overthrowing the bourgeois government and achieving the great October Socialist Revolution.

After the establishment of the Soviet government, the overthrown landlords and bourgeoisie, with the support of foreign armed interventionists, launched counter-revolutionary armed rebellions. In the spring of 1918, Lenin pointed out: "Now the class struggle has turned into civil war." The Soviet state went through another three and a half years of war, using revolutionary violence to crush the domestic counter-revolutionary rebellion and foreign armed intervention, and thus consolidated the victory of the revolution.

In 1919, Lenin summed up the experience of the October Revolution, saying: "In the October Revolution, revolutionary violence achieved a brilliant victory."

The October Revolution is a triumphant anthem of violent revolution that echoes through the heavens, a great victory of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of violent revolution. The cannon shot of the October Revolution will forever resonate in the hearts of revolutionary people, forever inspiring their fighting spirit, and strengthening their belief in taking up arms to engage in armed struggle. A few despicable traitors will never be able to make this thunderous roar disappear from the hearts of revolutionary people.

Brezhnev, in order to peddle the counter-revolutionary goods of "peaceful transition," not only arbitrarily distorts the history of the Soviet Union but also wants to rewrite the history of the world revolution over the past fifty years since the October Revolution. He said that "in the fifty years since the October Revolution, the world revolutionary movement has accumulated rich and varied experience," and that the transition from capitalism to socialism has seen "diversified" paths. What a "diversification"! The proletarian revolution has only one path, the path of violent revolution, and there is no such thing as "diversification." Brezhnev's "diversification" is actually the notorious "peaceful transition."

In the fifty years since the October Revolution, the world's proletariat and revolutionary people have advanced along the bright path opened up by the October Revolution and indeed accumulated rich experience. This experience precisely further proves that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution, while the so-called "peaceful transition," "parliamentary road" is all deceitful nonsense.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power by armed force, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist principle of revolution is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

Chairman Mao led the Chinese people in a twenty-two-year revolutionary war, achieving great revolutionary victories. He brilliantly and creatively solved a series of complex issues in seizing power by armed force, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new height. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Chairman Mao's leadership of the Chinese people in seizing power by armed force, in summary, is under the leadership of the proletarian party, mobilizing the peasant masses in the countryside to wage guerrilla warfare, carrying out land revolution, establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and finally seizing the cities." This is a new and great development of the path of seizing power by armed force in the October Revolution.

In the fifty years of world proletarian revolution, there have been both positive and negative experiences.

People will not forget that after World War II, some countries saw a counter-revolutionary revisionist trend that opposed violent revolution and advocated the parliamentary road. This trend brought great losses to the revolutions in some European and Asian countries. In France, Thorez handed over the people's weapons, which were won with the lives and blood of the revolutionary people. In Italy, Togliatti disbanded the guerrilla forces and insurgent workers' forces that had grown in battle. In India, the Indian Communist Party's revisionists betrayed the armed struggle of the peasants in the Telangana region. These traitors of the proletariat, in order to beg for a little leftovers from the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, ruined the revolutionary cause of the people in these countries.

By 1956, the great traitor Khrushchev openly advocated "peaceful transition" at the 20th Congress of the CPSU, forming a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Over the past decade, Khrushchev and his successors have crazily promoted this line, with the result that not a single country has "peacefully transitioned" from capitalism to socialism, but indeed, a number of socialist countries, including the Soviet Union, have "peacefully transitioned" to capitalism, and a number of communist parties, including Iraq, have suffered the disaster of party and leadership annihilation! Are these not the most serious lessons in the history of the international communist movement?

Fifty years of countless facts have repeatedly proven from both positive and negative aspects the great truth of Chairman Mao's proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Today, under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, the flames of people's armed struggle are blazing fiercely in vast regions around the world.

The great Vietnamese people are waging a great people's war, piercing the paper tiger of the so-called strongest imperialist in the world, the United States, with countless wounds.

The peoples of Laos, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, India, Indonesia, and other countries are taking up and persisting on the path of revolutionary armed struggle.

In Africa, Lumumba's blood deeply educates the oppressed nations and peoples. The drums of revolutionary armed struggle are shaking the African continent.

Latin America, which was once the quiet "backyard" of U.S. imperialism, has also become a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.

"Follow the path of Mao Zedong!" "Follow the path of the Chinese revolution!" This is the common conclusion drawn by millions of revolutionary people around the world from their own struggles.

In such a situation, imperialism and its various lackeys cannot but be anxious. Therefore, the Soviet revisionist traitors, who are tasked with maintaining imperialist rule in the capitalist world, naturally have to do everything they can to oppose violent revolution, oppose revolutionary armed struggle, in order to lull the people's fighting spirit, to make the people lay down their guns. They know that the fallacy of "peaceful transition" has long been thoroughly bankrupt, but they still cling to it. This is the law of class struggle, which is unchangeable.

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as twenty-nine years ago: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun."

The traitors of the October Revolution, the clowns who alter history, will ultimately be drowned by the torrent of history. "Thousands of sails pass by the wrecked ship." The proletariat and the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, are advancing bravely along the brilliant path opened up by the October Revolution. They will certainly use the gun to bury the entire dark old world and use the gun to create a bright red new world!

    绝不许苏修叛徒歪曲十月革命的道路
    丁学雷
    苏修叛徒集团的头目勃列日涅夫，在莫斯科“庆祝十月革命五十周年大会”上所作的“报告”中，一开头就对十月革命的道路进行无耻的歪曲。
    勃列日涅夫竟然把伟大的十月社会主义革命，称作“十月政变”。他绝口不提暴力革命，不提打碎资产阶级国家机器，不提用无产阶级专政代替资产阶级专政；而别有用心地大谈
  “在准备十月政变时已经积累了各种斗争形式（合法的与不合法的、和平的与非和平的、地下的与公开的）最丰富的经验。党已经准备好迅速地替换使用这些形式”，等等。这实际上就是公然否认十月革命的胜利是暴力革命的胜利，否认十月革命的道路是暴力革命的道路。
    列宁在《无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基》一书中说过：考茨基使用了“一套骗术”，以便使“革命就安然无事地消失了”。“考茨基需要运用一切遁词、诡辩和骗人的伪造，正是为的避开暴力革命，为的掩盖他背弃这种革命的行为”。叛徒考茨基的徒子徒孙，赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，也正是以玩弄这一套修正主义骗术为能事。
    过去，赫鲁晓夫采取的手法是，直截了当地篡改历史，胡说什么十月革命是“几乎是不流血的”，“表现了宽宏大量和人道的革命”；而且根据他的一批御用“学者”煞费苦心“考证”的结果，十月革命那一声炮响，即“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰射向冬宫的炮也只是一发没有炮弹的空炮……。现在，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流则拐弯抹角地把十月革命说成又“和平”、又“非和平”，说成是什么运用“各种斗争手段”的结果。手法虽然比赫鲁晓夫更狡猾了，但实质仍然是一样的。赫鲁晓夫及其继承者的这些谬论，都是为了掩盖他们对十月革命的背叛，为了反对暴力革命，推销“和平过渡”的黑货，帮助帝国主义和各国反动派对付革命的人民。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团打着“庆祝”十月革命的旗号，公然否定十月革命是无产阶级用革命暴力夺取政权的伟大革命。这是对伟大列宁的莫大侮辱，对苏联人民的光荣革命传统的莫大侮辱，对那些为缔造世界上第一个无产阶级专政国家而流血牺牲的革命先烈们的莫大侮辱！
    世界无产阶级和革命人民不会忘记，在十月革命前夕，列宁曾反复强调要教育群众认识到：无产阶级国家代替资产阶级国家必须通过暴力革命。他指出：“资产阶级国家由无产阶级国家（无产阶级专政）代替是不能经过‘自行消亡’来实现的，根据一般规律，只能靠暴力革命来实现。”
    一九一七年七月，反革命的克伦斯基政府，突然向革命开刀，彼得格勒街头洒遍了工人和士兵的鲜血。在列宁的指导下，布尔什维克党第六次代表大会决定了武装起义的方针。接着，列宁和布尔什维克党坚决领导工人和士兵举行武装起义，推翻了资产阶级政权，实现了伟大的十月社会主义革命。
    苏维埃政权成立以后，被推翻的地主和资产阶级，在外国武装干涉者的支持下，进行反革命武装叛乱。列宁在一九一八年春指出：“现在阶级斗争已经变成了内战”。苏维埃国家又经过了三年半的战争，用革命的暴力粉碎了国内反革命叛乱和国外武装干涉，才巩固了革命的胜利。
    一九一九年列宁总结十月革命的经验说：“在十月革命中，革命暴力取得了辉煌的胜利”。
    十月革命是一曲响彻云霄的暴力革命的凯歌，是马克思列宁主义关于暴力革命学说的伟大胜利。十月革命的炮声，永远响在革命人民的心中，永远鼓舞着他们的斗志，坚定着他们拿起枪杆子进行武装斗争的信念。一小撮卑劣无耻的叛徒永远也不能使这一声轰然巨响从革命人民心中消失。
    勃列日涅夫为了贩卖“和平过渡”的反革命货色，不仅任意歪曲苏联的历史，还想涂改十月革命以来五十年的世界革命的历史。他说什么“十月革命后的五十年以来，世界革命运动已积累了丰富的多方面的经验”，从资本主义向社会主义过渡，出现了“多样化”的道路。好一个“多样化”！无产阶级革命只有走暴力革命的道路，根本没有什么“多样化”的道路。勃列日涅夫宣扬的“多样化”，其实就是臭名昭著的“和平过渡”的同义语。
    十月革命以后的五十年，世界无产阶级和革命人民沿着十月革命开辟的光明大道前进，的确积累了丰富的经验。这些经验恰恰进一步证明暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，而所谓“和平过渡”、“议会道路”完全是骗人的鬼话。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    毛主席领导中国人民进行了二十二年的革命战争，取得了革命的伟大胜利。他天才地、创造性地解决了武装夺取政权的一系列复杂的课题，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的高峰。林彪同志指出：“毛主席领导中国人民武装夺取政权的道路，概括起来，就是在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村中发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。”这是十月革命武装夺取政权道路的新的伟大发展。
    五十年来世界无产阶级革命的历史，有正面经验，也有反面经验。
    人们不会忘记，在第二次世界大战以后，一些国家出现一股反对暴力革命，鼓吹议会道路的反革命修正主义逆流。这股逆流，给欧洲和亚洲一些国家的革命，带来了巨大损失。在法国，多列士拱手交出了革命人民用生命和鲜血换来的人民武装。在意大利，陶里亚蒂解散了在战斗中成长起来的游击队和起义工人队伍。在印度，印共修正主义分子出卖了特仑甘纳地区的农民武装斗争。这些无产阶级的叛徒，为了从大地主、大资产阶级那里讨到一点残羹剩饭，断送了这些国家人民的革命事业。
    到了一九五六年，大叛徒赫鲁晓夫在苏共二十次代表大会上公开宣扬“和平过渡”，形成了一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义路线。十多年来，赫鲁晓夫及其继承者疯狂地推行这条路线，其结果，没有一个国家从资本主义“和平过渡”到社会主义，倒确确实实地有苏联等一批社会主义国家“和平过渡”到资本主义，有伊拉克等一批共产党遭到亡党、亡头的惨祸！这些，难道不是国际共产主义运动史上最严重的教训吗？
    五十年来的无数事实，从正反两方面反复证明了毛主席提出的“枪杆子里面出政权”这一颠扑不破的伟大真理。
    今天，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，人民武装斗争的烈火，正以燎原之势，在世界上的广大地区猛烈地燃烧。
    伟大的越南人民正在进行着一场伟大的人民战争，把号称全世界最强大的美帝国主义纸老虎戳得千疮百孔。
    老挝、缅甸、菲律宾、泰国、印度、印尼等国人民，正在走上和坚持革命武装斗争的道路。
    在非洲，卢蒙巴的鲜血深深教育了被压迫民族和被压迫人民。革命武装的战鼓声震动着非洲大陆。
    拉丁美洲这个美帝国主义当年的安静的“后院”，也已成为一座随时爆发的火山。
      “走毛泽东的道路！”“走中国革命的道路！”这是世界上千百万革命人民从自己的斗争实践中得出的共同结论。
    在这样的形势下，帝国主义和它的形形色色的走狗们是不能不发慌的。因此，以维护帝国主义在资本主义世界的统治为己任的苏修叛徒们，就自然要千方百计地反对暴力革命，反对革命的武装斗争，借以麻痹人民的斗志，要人民放下枪杆子。他们明知道那个“和平过渡”的谬论早已彻底破产，但是他们还是死死地咬住不放。这是阶级斗争的规律，是改变不了的。
    毛主席早在二十九年前就指出：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”
    十月革命的叛徒、涂改历史的小丑，最后只能被历史的洪流所淹没。“沉舟侧畔千帆过”。全世界无产阶级同被压迫人民、被压迫民族，高举着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，正在沿着十月革命开辟的光辉道路奋勇前进。他们一定能够用枪杆子埋葬掉整个黑暗的旧世界，用枪杆子创造出一个红彤彤的新世界！
