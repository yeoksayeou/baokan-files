The Lao People's Liberation Army High Command has issued a mobilization directive, calling on the patriotic military and civilians of Laos to press forward and build on the great victories of the rainy season, achieving even greater and more glorious victories in the dry season.

The directive states: This year's rainy season was a season of victory. Patriotic military and civilians across the country have actively competed and fulfilled the tasks set by the High Command, achieving many brilliant victories.

The directive states: The patriotic military and civilians are fighting stronger and stronger, achieving greater victories. The enemy not only failed to achieve their plan to encroach and attack the liberated areas but were also defeated by our military and civilians, pushing them into an even more passive and chaotic situation.

The directive states: As the dry season approaches, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, in an attempt to salvage their failures, are plotting to intensify and expand the war across the entire Indochina. Therefore, the situation in the dry season will be even more intense, difficult, and complex, and U.S. imperialism will escalate the "special war" in Laos to a more serious level.

The directive states: To implement the resolutions of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, during this dry season, our military's task is to, together with the patriotic people and patriotic neutral forces across the country, resolutely and proactively thwart all enemy schemes to encroach and attack the liberated areas. In all aspects, especially in political and ideological aspects, we must actively build a powerful tripartite armed force, vigorously win over people of all ethnic groups, build the liberated areas into a strong revolutionary base, increase production, and practice strict economy.

The directive states: To complete the above arduous tasks, the specific work of our military in the dry season is: All units must always firmly grasp the initiative, annihilate a large number of enemies, and keep the enemy in a passive and more disastrous position; vigorously establish revolutionary grassroots organizations, widely and deeply propagate the line, policies, and victories of the revolutionary struggle of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front among the people of all strata, actively, seriously, and resolutely implement the policy of national unity and military discipline; seize every opportunity to increase production, practice strict economy, oppose corruption and waste, actively improve the life of the troops; from political, military, and logistical aspects, vigorously build and consolidate a powerful army, improve the revolutionary quality of the army, and pay attention to expanding democracy within the army.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, November 22nd, according to the broadcast of the Pathet Lao radio station: The brave patriotic military and civilians of the Nam Bao area of Luang Prabang Province, Laos, have fought tenaciously from March to October this year, annihilating 2,128 enemy troops.

According to statistics, the patriotic military and civilians of the Nam Bao area also sank 33 enemy motorboats and motorized boats, destroyed 19 cannons and machine guns of various calibers, and seized 1,065 weapons and a large amount of military supplies during this period.

    指示说：为了完成上述的繁重任务，我们军队在旱季里的具体工作是：所有各个部队必须时刻牢牢掌握主动权，消灭大量敌人，使敌人经常处于被动地位和遭到更惨重的失败；大力建立革命基层组织，在各阶层人民中广泛和深入地宣传老挝爱国战线党中央的路线、政策和革命斗争的胜利，积极、严肃和坚决地贯彻民族团结政策和军队纪律；争取一切时间增加生产，厉行节约，反对贪污、浪费，积极改善部队生活；从政治、军事、后勤等方面大力建设和巩固强大的部队，提高军队的革命素质，注意扩大军队中的民主。
