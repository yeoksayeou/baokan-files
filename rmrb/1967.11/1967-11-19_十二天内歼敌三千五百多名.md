South Vietnamese military and civilians in Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province have launched the first battle of the winter-spring campaign, achieving remarkable victories.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Southern East Zone Command recently issued a communiqué, enthusiastically celebrating the brilliant achievements of the military and civilians in the northern parts of Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province at the end of October and the beginning of November.

The communiqué stated that from October 28 to November 8, the military and civilians in the northern parts of Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province collectively eliminated and disintegrated more than 3,500 enemy troops (including over 2,000 American invaders). They completely annihilated five enemy battalions (four American battalions), thirteen companies (three American companies), and one puppet armored unit. They destroyed forty-five tanks and armored vehicles, shot down and destroyed thirteen aircraft, destroyed thirty-six 105mm, 155mm, and 175mm artillery pieces, demolished numerous bunkers and barracks, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The communiqué said that from the battle situation in the northern parts of Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province over the past twelve days, it can be seen that our military and civilians have a very high determination to eliminate the enemy. We have fought continuously and decisively defeated the American puppet forces. The coordination among the three armed forces and various battlefields is also very harmonious.

The communiqué said that the military and civilians in the northern parts of Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province have been continuously tempered and grown in battle practice. Therefore, at the beginning of the 1967-1968 winter-spring season, in a very short period, on a battlefield with a small area and population, and under the condition that the enemy has aircraft and artillery, they were able to defeat the American puppet forces and eliminate a large number of enemy troops. In the battle, the people's liberation armed forces used extremely flexible tactics, with infantry and artillery closely coordinating, acting very quickly, decisively, secretly, and suddenly, making the enemy unable to resist.

The communiqué said that the victory of the military and civilians in the northern parts of Tuyen Duc Province and Binh Dinh Province has extremely significant implications. It first indicates that our military and civilians are determined to fully implement the call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam for a great victory in the winter-spring season. No matter how stubbornly the American aggressors strengthen the war of aggression and how they play tricks with the "peace talks" deception, our military and civilians will fight resolutely and will definitely achieve victory.

    南越土龙木省和边和省军民打响夺取冬春季大捷第一仗
    十二天内歼敌三千五百多名
    南越解放武装力量运用极其灵活的战术，紧密配合，迅速行动，使敌人无法招架
    新华社河内十八日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方人民解放武装力量南部东区指挥部最近发表公报，热烈欢呼土龙木省北部和边和省北部军民十月底和十一月初取得的辉煌战果。
    公报说，据不完全统计，从十月二十八日到十一月八日，土龙木省北部和边和省北部军民共消灭和瓦解敌人三千五百多名
  （其中美国侵略军二千多名），全歼敌人五个营（美军四个营）、十三个连（美军三个连）和一个伪军装甲支队；击毁坦克和装甲车四十五辆，击落和击毁飞机十三架，击毁一○五、一五五和一七五毫米口径大炮三十六门，摧毁许多碉堡和兵营，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    公报说，从土龙木省北部和边和省北部军民过去十二天的战斗情况可以看到，我们军民的歼敌决心是非常高的，我们连续战斗，坚决战胜美伪军。三种武装力量之间、各个战场之间配合得也非常协调。
    公报说，土龙木省北部和边和省北部军民在战斗实践中得到了不断的锤炼和成长，因而在进入一九六七——一九六八年冬春季的时候，在很短期间内，在一个地区不大、人口不多的战场上，在敌人占有飞机、大炮的情况下，能够战胜美伪军，消灭大量敌人有生力量，歼灭许多敌军建制单位。在战斗中，人民解放武装力量运用极其灵活的战术，步兵与炮兵紧密配合，行动非常迅速、坚决、秘密和突然，使敌人无法招架。
    公报说，土龙木省北部和边和省北部军民的胜利，具有极其重大的意义。它首先表明了我们军民彻底实现越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团夺取冬春季大捷的号召的意志。不管美国强盗怎样顽固地加强侵略战争，怎样大肆玩弄“和平谈判”的骗局，我们军民将坚决战斗，并且必定取得胜利。
