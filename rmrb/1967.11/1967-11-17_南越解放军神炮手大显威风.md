The brave South Vietnamese Liberation Army in the Kun Song province has, on the 16th, for the second consecutive day, launched a fierce artillery barrage on the American military base in De Tu, causing heavy losses and chaos among the enemy.

This base is a crucial supply point for the more than 10,000 American and puppet troops operating in the rugged and heavily forested De Tu region. Since November 4th, the Liberation Army of Kun Song province has launched a fierce offensive in this area, annihilating and severely damaging the enemy's twelve companies in eight days. The American invaders were greatly alarmed and hastily dispatched a brigade from the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, totaling 6,000 troops, along with a large number of puppet forces to reinforce the area.

After luring the enemy into this mountainous region, the Liberation Army immediately took advantage of the terrain to launch attacks and ambushes, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the 15th, the Liberation Army, from morning to evening, launched four consecutive fierce artillery barrages on this base from the heavily forested hills surrounding the base. The concentrated artillery shells accurately destroyed the runway and facilities of the airfield, rendering the transport planes that the American and puppet forces relied on unable to land. The gunners of the Liberation Army also destroyed the base's ammunition depot, causing a massive explosion within the base. The fire burned from morning to evening and only extinguished the next morning. A camp of a special forces unit of the American and puppet forces near the ammunition depot was completely destroyed. The artillery shells also hit the warehouse storing poison gas that the American invaders planned to use in this battle, filling the base with a thick cloud of poison gas. The American soldiers, in their panic, had to don gas masks as they fled.

On the morning of the 16th, the Liberation Army launched two more fierce artillery barrages on the base, causing chaos within. According to reports from Western news agencies, a pilot of an American C-130 transport plane described the scene of the fierce barrage: "We had just stepped out of the plane when the first volley of shells exploded beside the plane." "The second volley hit the tail of another C-130 transport plane next to us. I saw fragments flying, and I shouted, 'Mortars are coming!' Everyone ran. As soon as we saw a hole or a shelter, we dove in." Another American lieutenant, after the barrage, was still shaken and said, "They (the Liberation Army) have excellent mortar crews."

Currently, the Liberation Army's fierce artillery barrages on this base are still ongoing.

On the 14th, the Liberation Army south of the Demilitarized Zone shot down a helicopter carrying Brigadier General Bruno Hochmuth, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division, and his two aides, as well as three crew members, near Hue City. This American military leader and his entourage were on an inspection tour of the U.S. Marine Corps, which had been severely battered by the Liberation Army south of the Demilitarized Zone, when their helicopter was shot down.

On November 15th, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a series of fierce artillery barrages on the American airbase in De Tu, turning this important supply base of the American invaders into a sea of fire.

    南越解放军神炮手大显威风
    接连猛轰昆嵩省德都美军基地打得敌人一片混乱
    摧毁基地弹药库，引起猛烈大爆炸，大火燃烧一昼夜，敌军营地全烧光
    据新华社河内十六日电　英勇的越南南方昆嵩省人民解放武装力量十六日接连第二天猛烈炮击美军德都基地，打得敌人损失惨重，狼狈不堪。
    这个基地是正在这个山岭险峻、森林茂密的德都地区作战的一万多美伪军的重要供应基地。昆嵩省人民解放武装力量自十一月四日在这个地区内发起猛烈攻势，在八天中接连歼灭和重创敌人十二个连。侵越美军头目大为惊慌，急忙调动美国第四步兵师的一个旅和第一七三空降旅共六千人以及大量伪军到这个地区增援。
    人民解放武装力量在把敌人吸引到这个山区以后，立即利用有利的地势，到处袭击和伏击敌人，使敌人遭到严重伤亡。十五日，人民解放武装力量在这个美军基地森林茂密的山岭上，从早上到晚上对这个基地进行了连续四次猛烈的炮击。密集的炮弹准确地击毁了机场的跑道和设施，美伪军赖以接济的运输机已无法在这个机场降落。人民解放武装力量的炮手们还摧毁了基地的弹药库，在基地内引起了猛烈的爆炸，大火从早上烧到晚上，一直到第二天早上才熄灭。在弹药库附近的一个美伪军特种部队的营地被全部烧毁。炮弹还击中了美国侵略军准备在这次战斗中使用的毒气弹的仓库，基地内漂荡着一片毒气，美国少爷兵在狼狈逃命时不得不都戴上了防毒面罩。
  十六日上午，人民解放武装力量又接连两次对这个基地进行猛烈的炮击，打得基地内一片混乱。据西方通讯社报道，一个美军C—130运输机的驾驶员战战兢兢地描绘这次猛烈炮击的情景说，我们刚刚走出飞机，“突然第一阵炮弹就在飞机旁边爆炸起来”。“第二阵炮弹又击中了我们旁边的另一架C—130运输机的尾部。我看到了碎片飞起来，我大叫：‘迫击炮打来了！’每个人都跑起来。我们一看到洞子和掩体就钻进去。”另一个美国侵略军的中尉在炮击后更心有余悸地说：“他们（人民解放武装力量）那里有十分优秀的迫击炮手。”
    现在，人民解放武装力量对这个基地猛烈炮击还在继续进行中。
    非军事区以南的人民解放武装力量十四日在顺化市以北击落了美国海军陆战队第三师师长布鲁诺·霍克穆斯少将乘坐的直升飞机。这个美军头目和他的两个随员以及三名机组人员全部摔死。他的这架直升飞机是在视察非军事区以南被人民解放武装力量打得焦头烂额的美国海军陆战队时被击落的。（附图片）
    十一月十五日，越南南方解放武装力量连续猛烈炮击德都的美军机场，把这个侵越美军的重要供应基地炸成一片火海。
