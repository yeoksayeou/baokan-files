The editorials of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside," sounded the charge to thoroughly criticize the counterrevolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in rural work. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in the Civil Aviation Administration, and the broad revolutionary masses, resolutely stand with the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, following the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, to thoroughly settle accounts with the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev in the agricultural sector over the past decade.

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, starting from the third year after the founding of New China, our civil aviation industry began operations to prevent and treat crop pests and diseases, directly serving agricultural production. Guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, it powerfully supported the socialist collective economy. Therefore, the Chinese Khrushchev hated it to the core. While strangling agricultural cooperativization, he used every means to prevent civil aviation from serving China's socialist agriculture.

In 1955, under Chairman Mao's great call, the wave of agricultural cooperativization swept the nation. Agricultural cooperativization opened up a vast sky for agricultural aviation. In 1955, agricultural aviation increased by 295% compared to 1954. Chairman Mao taught us: "In agriculture, under the conditions of our country (in capitalist countries, it is to make agriculture capitalist), cooperativization must come first, and then large machinery can be used." The practice of agricultural aviation operations powerfully proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment. A single household's small peasant economy could not possibly use machinery, let alone an airplane, a large piece of machinery. The Chinese Khrushchev's absurd "theory" of "mechanization first, cooperativization later" was merely an excuse to hack down agricultural cooperatives, oppose the socialist revolution in the countryside, and its evil purpose was to restore capitalism in the countryside, keeping the vast poor and lower-middle peasants in perpetual poverty, serving as beasts of burden for the landlord and bourgeoisie. History is merciless; the wheel of agricultural cooperativization rolled forward, and hundreds of millions of peasants, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao's guidance, advanced bravely on the broad avenue, shattering the beautiful dreams of the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists.

Just as we were better serving the socialist economy in the countryside according to Chairman Mao's teachings, in early 1956, the Chinese Khrushchev issued a black "directive" to the civil aviation industry: "Special aviation must be developed... mainly focusing on heavy industry, transportation, magnetometry, and photography," "first meeting the needs of industry, transportation, and water conservancy, and then arranging some for agriculture and forestry." He deliberately lowered the status of agricultural aviation, attempting to weaken the support of civil aviation for agricultural cooperativization, sabotage agricultural production, and brazenly oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary leading cadres and masses of civil aviation, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely resisted the Chinese Khrushchev's black "directive," smashed the various plots of his handful of black claws in civil aviation, and prioritized the development of agricultural aviation. Especially after the establishment of people's communes in 1958, civil aviation agricultural aviation developed even more, and the proportion of agricultural aviation in the entire special aviation industry quickly increased to 80%. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, with the most beautiful language, thanked the great leader Chairman Mao for his warm concern and thanked Chairman Mao for sending airplanes to support agriculture.

"The enemy will not be eliminated by itself." The Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen, during a period of temporary difficulties in our national economy, collaborated with the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary forces to spread the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract" at home, attacking Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, attempting to disintegrate the collective economy in agriculture, restore individual farming, and let capitalism run rampant in the countryside. It was under these circumstances that agricultural aviation was also greatly affected, and the workload plummeted. However, in the face of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, all the plots of the Chinese Khrushchev were doomed to fail. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants were fully mobilized, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution brought about a bumper harvest in agriculture. This year's civil aviation agricultural aviation has also developed greatly, with the highest workload in history.

The Chinese Khrushchev caused trouble, failed, caused more trouble, and failed again, and finally suffered a thorough defeat in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Great Mao Zedong Thought has occupied the rural battlefield, and the socialist countryside is leaping forward. Our aviation industry serving socialist agriculture is also leaping forward!

    坚决地为社会主义农业服务
    ——揭露中国赫鲁晓夫破坏农业飞行的滔天罪行
    民航总局机关无产阶级革命派
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的重要文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，吹响了彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村工作中的反革命修正主义路线的进军号。我们民航总局机关无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，坚决和亿万革命人民一起，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫十几年来在农业方面所犯下的滔天罪行。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，从新中国成立后的第三年开始，我国的民用航空事业，就开始了防治农作物病虫害等直接为农业生产服务的作业。它在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，有力地支援了社会主义集体经济。因此，中国赫鲁晓夫对它恨之入骨，他在扼杀农业合作化的同时，千方百计阻止民用航空为我国社会主义农业服务。
    一九五五年，在毛主席的伟大号召下，农业合作化的高潮遍及全国。农业合作化为农业飞行开辟了广阔的天地，一九五五年的农业飞行就比一九五四年增长了百分之二百九十五。毛主席教导我们：“在农业方面，在我国的条件下（在资本主义国家内是使农业资本主义化），则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”农业飞行作业的实践，有力地证明了毛主席的英明论断。一家一户的小农经济，根本不可能使用机器，更谈不上使用飞机这样大型的机械。中国赫鲁晓夫
  “先机械化，后合作化”的荒谬“理论”，只不过是用来大砍农业合作社，反对农村社会主义革命的一个借口，其罪恶目的是要在农村复辟资本主义，使广大贫农下中农永远处于贫困的地位，为地主资产阶级做牛做马。历史是无情的，农业合作化的巨轮滚滚向前，亿万农民沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的康庄大道奋勇前进，打破了中国赫鲁晓夫等一小撮反革命修正主义分子的美梦。
    正当我们按照毛主席的教导，更好地为农村社会主义经济服务的时候，一九五六年初，中国赫鲁晓夫对民航下了一道黑“指示”：“专业航空要搞起来……主要着重重工业、交通、磁测、摄影”，“先满足工业、交通、水利航测，再安排一些农业林业。”他尽力压低农业飞行的位置，妄图削弱民航对农业合作化的支持，破坏农业生产，猖狂地反对毛主席的革命路线。民航的革命领导干部和革命群众在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，坚决地抵制了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑“指示”，粉碎了他伸向民航的一小撮黑爪牙的种种阴谋，优先发展了农业飞行。尤其是一九五八年人民公社化以后，民航农业飞行得到更大的发展，农业飞行在整个专业航空中的比重迅速增至百分之八十。广大贫下中农以最最美好的语言，感谢伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，感谢毛主席派来了飞机支援农业。
    “敌人是不会自行消灭的。”中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙，在我国国民经济处于暂时困难时期，又配合帝修反，在国内刮起了“三自一包”的黑风，攻击毛主席的革命路线，妄图瓦解农业集体经济，恢复单干，让资本主义在农村自由泛滥。正是在这种情况下，农业飞行也大受影响，工作量骤然下降。但是，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，中国赫鲁晓夫的一切阴谋都是永远不能得逞的。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，亿万贫下中农充分发动起来了，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命带来了农业大丰收，今年的民航农业飞行又得到了极大的发展，工作量是历史上最高的一年。
    中国赫鲁晓夫捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，终于在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，遭到了彻底的失败。伟大的毛泽东思想占领了农村阵地，社会主义的农村在飞跃前进，我们为社会主义农业服务的飞行事业也在飞跃前进！
