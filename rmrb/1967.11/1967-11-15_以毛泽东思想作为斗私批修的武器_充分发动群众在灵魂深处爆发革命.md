The support and leftist team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force helped the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Computer Technology Research Institute hold a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. They gained some experience in breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism, establishing proletarian party spirit, and consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity in terms of politics and ideology. These experiences can be summarized as follows: Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fully mobilizing the masses to consciously undergo a revolution in their souls, breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, especially mobilizing the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to take the lead in making self-criticisms, opening up a breakthrough in breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism, making petty-bourgeois factionalism stink, and solidifying the ideological foundation for revolutionary great unity.

The two revolutionary mass organizations in this institute, which had long been engaged in "internal warfare," have now united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a united and friendly revolutionary fighting collective. Revolutionary masses participating in the study class said with confidence: Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we have broken down factionalism and achieved revolutionary great unity, which will surely yield more abundant results in revolution and scientific research.

The key to breaking down factionalism lies in fighting selfishness

The first experience of the Mao Zedong Thought study class in this institute in breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism is: Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly exposing the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism, and thoroughly digging up the ideological root of petty-bourgeois factionalism—“selfishness,” continuously raising the consciousness of the revolutionary masses to break down petty-bourgeois factionalism and establish proletarian party spirit.

When the study class was first established, many participants had an insufficient understanding of the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism. The military support and leftist team guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary great unity and to discuss the situation of revolutionary great unity in their unit. Everyone clearly saw during the discussion of the situation that the main obstacle to revolutionary great unity was petty-bourgeois factionalism. They further analyzed the various harms of petty-bourgeois factionalism: First, emphasizing “me as the core,” “only I am left,” “only I am revolutionary,” hindering revolutionary great unity; second, easily directing the struggle against their own comrades, engaging in endless “internal warfare,” deviating from the revolutionary struggle's grand direction; third, affecting the unity of revolutionary mass organizations in fighting against the enemy, unable to better concentrate forces to carry out a thorough criticism and reform of the unit; fourth, often treating cadres with sectarianism, interfering with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, hindering the revolution's “three-in-one combination”; fifth, being Marxist towards others and liberal towards oneself, affecting the revolutionization of thought; sixth, mutual obstruction, affecting cooperation, hindering production; seventh, treating the People's Liberation Army, which supports the left, with small-groupism, unable to properly implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of “supporting the army and loving the people,” affecting military-civilian unity.

The harms of petty-bourgeois factionalism were laid bare, and the military support and leftist team and the study class members believed: This is only the beginning of overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism. Hidden behind petty-bourgeois factionalism is the character “selfishness.” If “selfishness” is not overcome, factionalism will not stink, and the key to breaking down factionalism lies in fighting selfishness. Therefore, they fiercely fought against selfishness. Some comrades from the original rebel faction said: In the past, they one-sidedly believed that only they were the genuine revolutionary faction, while some cadres from the “East is Red” side were seen as “revisionist sprouts,” and they always wanted to overthrow them during the movement. Originally, some comrades from the “East is Red” corps also checked: When some comrades from the other side proposed to “pull out the sprouts,” they would “retaliate” by exaggerating the issue. Everyone said: In the past, such “internal warfare” was actually “selfish warfare.” After exposing the harms of petty-bourgeois factionalism and digging up the roots, everyone fought against selfishness, and the consciousness of breaking down factionalism was greatly enhanced.

Make self-criticisms and do not keep “selfishness” secret

The second experience of this study class in breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism is: Firmly implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to make more self-criticisms, mobilizing everyone to consciously undergo a revolution in their souls, daring to fire at the “selfishness” in their minds.

At the beginning, the participants in the study class had different understandings of how to fight selfishness and break down petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some still had a stomach full of anger, advocating first to debate and affirm their faction's grand direction before fighting selfishness. The military support and leftist team organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on making more self-criticisms and Vice Chairman Lin's related instructions, making everyone clearly understand that serious self-criticism is an effective weapon for us to get rid of bad habits and maintain good habits. Those proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end must not only regard themselves as a force for the revolution but also continuously regard themselves as the object of the revolution. Otherwise, it would be impossible to complete the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

After studying, everyone truly realized that whether or not to make more self-criticisms is a sign of one's revolutionary consciousness and a key to quickly breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism. Thus, self-criticism quickly became a trend. Originally, some comrades who had a stomach full of anger and were prepared to criticize others in the study class felt ashamed after hearing others' sincere self-criticisms, immediately dissipated their anger, and also publicly made self-criticisms. Some comrades even took out all their “internal warfare diaries” and made self-criticisms, asking comrades to criticize them. He said: “I will not keep ‘secrets,’ keeping ‘secrets’ is equivalent to keeping ‘selfishness.’”

Leaders take the lead in opening up a breakthrough in breaking down factionalism

The third experience of this study class in breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism is: Leaders take the lead in opening up a breakthrough in breaking down factionalism, leading the masses, and the masses promoting the leaders, quickly launching a wave of breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism, and solidifying the ideological foundation for revolutionary great unity. This study class fought selfishness and broke down factionalism, starting first with the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations. The military support and leftist team believed that these leaders are the backbone of the masses. As long as they take the lead, the masses will follow. Their consciousness is relatively high, they love Chairman Mao, and they listen to Chairman Mao's words, so they can take the lead in revolutionizing themselves. Of course, they also have concerns, mainly fearing to appear ugly or painful. In response to this situation, the military comrades studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the “Three Articles” with them, firmly supporting and encouraging them, helping them break with petty-bourgeois factionalism. When some masses lagged behind the situation and pulled their legs, the military comrades patiently did ideological work among the masses.

The leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations actively made public and sincere self-criticisms, which caused a strong reaction among the masses. The proletarian revolutionary factions in various rooms, departments, and workshops immediately took action, convened a self-criticism and rectification oath-taking meeting, and in just a few days, more than ten study classes were set up at the grassroots level, universally holding heart-to-heart talks and sharing sessions with fighting selfishness as the center. Leaders leading the masses, and the masses promoting the leaders, a mass movement of fighting selfishness and breaking down petty-bourgeois factionalism quickly formed throughout the Computer Technology Research Institute.

    空军某部怎样帮助计算技术研究所革命派实现革命大联合的？
    以毛泽东思想作为斗私批修的武器  充分发动群众在灵魂深处爆发革命
    据新华社十四日讯　人民解放军空军某部支左小组帮助中国科学院计算技术研究所无产阶级革命派举办的毛泽东思想学习班，在大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，从政治上、思想上巩固和发展革命大联合方面，取得了一些经验。这些经验集中到一点就是：以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，充分发动群众自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，特别是发动革命群众组织的头头带头多作自我批评，打开破小资产阶级派性的突破口，把小资产阶级派性搞臭，把革命大联合的思想基础打牢。
    这个研究所过去长期打“内战”的两大革命群众组织，经过学习班的学习，现在已经统一在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，结成团结友爱的革命战斗集体。参加学习班的革命群众满怀信心地说：我们在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，破除派性，实现了革命大联合，必将在革命和科研方面结出更丰硕的成果。
    破派性的关键在于斗私
    这个研究所的毛泽东思想学习班，破小资产阶级派性的第一条经验是：以毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭小资产阶级派性的危害，狠挖产生小资产阶级派性的思想根源——“私”字，不断提高革命群众大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性的自觉性。
    学习班刚成立时，参加学习的不少同志对小资产阶级派性的危害认识不足。部队支左小组引导大家大学毛主席关于革命大联合的指示，大摆本单位革命大联合的形势。大家在摆形势的时候，清楚地看到，革命大联合的障碍，主要是小资产阶级派性作怪。他们进而分析了小资产阶级派性的种种危害：一、强调“以我为核心”、“唯我独左”、“唯我独革”，妨碍革命的大联合；二、容易把斗争矛头指向自己的战友，“内战”不休，背离革命斗争大方向；三、影响革命群众组织之间团结对敌，不能更好地集中力量搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改；四、往往以宗派主义对待干部，干扰毛主席的伟大战略部署，妨碍革命的“三结合”；五、对人是马克思主义，对己是自由主义，影响思想革命化；六、互相扯皮，影响协作，妨碍生产；七、以小团体主义对待支左的人民解放军，不能很好地贯彻毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大指示，影响军民团结。
    小资产阶级派性的危害摆出来了，部队支左小组和学习班的学员们认为：这只是克服小资产阶级派性的开始。隐藏在小资产阶级派性背后的是一个“私”字。“私”字斗不倒，派性臭不了，破派性的关键在于斗私。于是，他们猛斗私心。原造反团的一些同志说：过去片面地认为唯有自己是响当当的革命派，而把“东方红”那边的一些骨干看成是“修正主义苗子”，运动中总想把人家整垮。原来“东方红”兵团的一些同志也检查说：当对方一些同志提出拔“苗子”时，就“以牙还牙”，给对方无限上纲。大家说：过去这样打“内战”，实际上是打“私战”。经过揭小资产阶级派性的危害，挖根源，大家斗私心，破派性的自觉性大大提高了。
    多作自我批评，绝不为“私”保密
    这个学习班破小资产阶级派性的第二条经验是：坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于多作自我批评的教导，发动大家自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，敢于向自己头脑中的“私”字开火。
    参加学习班的同志开始在怎样斗私心，破小资产阶级派性的问题上，认识不一致。有的还憋着一肚子气，主张先辩论，肯定了本派的大方向以后再斗私。部队支左小组组织大家反复学习毛主席关于多作自我批评的指示和林副主席的有关指示，使大家明确认识到，认真的自我批评，是使我们去掉不良作风，保持优良作风的有效的武器。决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。否则，就不可能完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。
    经过学习，大家真正认识到了能否多作自我批评是自己革命觉悟高低的标志，是能否迅速破除小资产阶级派性的关键。这样，自我批评便很快形成了风气。原来憋着一肚子气准备在学习班大整别人的同志，听了别人诚恳的自我批评，感到很惭愧，马上消了气，也公开作了自我批评。有的同志还拿出自己所有的“内战日记”，作了自我批评，还请同志们批评。他说：“我决不保‘密’，保‘密’就等于保‘私’。”
    头头带头打开破派性的突破口
    这个学习班破小资产阶级派性的第三条经验是：头头带头打开破派性的突破口，头头带群众，群众促头头，迅速掀起大破小资产阶级派性的热潮，把革命大联合的思想基础打得牢牢的。这个学习班斗私心，破派性，首先是从两派革命群众组织的头头着手的。解放军支左小组认为，这些头头是群众中的骨干分子，只要他们走在前面，群众一定会跟上去。他们的觉悟比较高，热爱毛主席，听毛主席的话，是能够带头革自己的命的。当然，他们也有顾虑，主要是怕丑、怕痛。针对这种情况，部队的同志就和他们一起学习毛主席的最新指示，学习“老三篇”，坚决地支持和鼓励他们，帮助他们同小资产阶级派性决裂。当有些群众跟不上形势，拉他们的后腿时，部队的同志又耐心地去做群众的思想工作。
    两派革命群众组织的头头主动作了公开的、诚恳的自我批评，在群众中引起了强烈的反应。各室、处、车间的无产阶级革命派立即行动起来，召开了斗私批修誓师大会，在短短几天内基层单位就办起了十几个学习班，普遍举行了以斗私为中心内容的交心会、讲用会。头头带群众，群众促头头，一个群众性的斗私心，破小资产阶级派性的自我革命的学习热潮，很快地在整个计算技术研究所形成了。
