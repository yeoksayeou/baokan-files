Foreign friends in China commemorated the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant document, "Statement in Support of the People of the Congo (Leopoldville) Against U.S. Aggression." On the eve of this anniversary, various foreign friends expressed their views to Xinhua News Agency correspondents, enthusiastically hailing the great victories achieved by the world's revolutionary peoples under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, uniting to fight against U.S. imperialism and all its lackeys.

In discussing the great historical significance of Chairman Mao's statement, the foreign friends expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao. They spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They wished Chairman Mao eternal life and vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of the great teacher of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, to summon courage, dare to fight, fear no hardships, and press forward to open fire on imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and to annihilate all demons.

Sudanese friend Muhammad Wafi said, Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the People of the Congo (Leopoldville) Against U.S. Aggression" is not only a great encouragement and support for the struggle of the Congolese people and the African people, but also a great encouragement and support for the struggle of all the peoples of the world for freedom and independence. This statement, issued from the East, has shaken the entire world. It is a heavy blow to all reactionary forces.

Wafi excitedly said, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the entire African continent has been set ablaze, and the call to fight against imperialism and modern revisionism is resounding everywhere. The African people clearly see that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought, only by following the teachings of Chairman Mao on people's war, can they achieve victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle. He said, the revolutionary peoples of Africa love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought boundlessly. Now, many revolutionaries in Africa are carrying Chairman Mao's Little Red Book because they know that Chairman Mao's book is an invincible weapon for people's revolution. Using it, the world revolution can achieve victory and defeat imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism.

Palestinian friend Basim Hakim said, Chairman Mao's statement is a great Marxist-Leninist document, a thought weapon for all the peoples of the world in their struggle. It shines like a lighthouse, illuminating the path forward for all oppressed peoples of the world.

Basim Hakim angrily denounced the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Arab people and the peoples of the world. He said, in the struggle against the aggression of Israel and the struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Arab people have fully realized that only by uniting and taking Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and persisting in people's war, can they defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel. To oppose U.S. imperialism, one must oppose Soviet modern revisionism. We, the revolutionary peoples of Arabia, are determined to fight along the path indicated by Chairman Mao until we achieve final victory.

Japanese director of the Gear Wheel Theater, Fujikawa Natsu, said, Chairman Mao's statement has given unlimited fighting courage to all oppressed nations and peoples of the world. The Japanese people deeply understand that the various counter-revolutionary acts of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Miyamoto revisionist clique are merely putting a noose around their own necks and lifting stones to drop on their own feet.

Fujikawa Natsu said, under the leadership of the left wing of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people resolutely, together with all the peoples of the world, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance along the path of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, and march forward bravely.

Colombian friend Leonardo Cruz said, Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the People of the Congo (Leopoldville) Against U.S. Aggression" has greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary peoples and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism. Chairman Mao's statement has pointed out the path forward for all the peoples of the world, calling on all the peoples of the world to unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys. All the peoples of the world, from Chairman Mao's teachings, have further realized that the fundamental way to defeat U.S. imperialism is to take up arms and engage in revolutionary struggle. Under Chairman Mao's call, the anti-U.S. struggle of all the peoples of the world is surging, and the national liberation movement is thriving, presenting a very good revolutionary situation throughout the world.

Leonardo Cruz said, U.S. imperialism is the most greedy and brutal international policeman, stretching its hands far and wide, invading everywhere, and encountering strong opposition from all the peoples of the world. It cannot escape its doomed fate. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement, U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that is tightening the noose around its own neck. All the peoples of the world, from Chairman Mao's wise teachings, have drawn unlimited inspiration and drawn boundless strength. The increasingly awakened peoples of Latin America remember Chairman Mao's teachings, unite, and persist in struggle, determined to bury U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries together.

Italian friends Maria Regis and Giuseppe Regis pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement issued three years ago is increasingly resonating in the hearts of the peoples of the world and is guiding the world's revolutionary peoples in their victorious struggle against imperialism and revisionism. They said, Chairman Mao is the great teacher of all the revolutionary peoples of the world. All the revolutionary peoples of the world, united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, can advance from victory to victory, defeat all enemies, and achieve thorough liberation.

    在我国的各国朋友纪念毛主席的光辉文件发表三周年
    世界人民团结在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下
    向帝修反猛烈开火坚决消灭一切害人虫
    新华社二十七日讯  毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年前夕，在中国的各国朋友向本社记者发表谈话，纪念这一光辉文件的发表，热烈欢呼世界革命人民遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，团结起来，在反对美帝国主义及其一切走狗的斗争中取得了伟大的胜利。
    各国朋友在谈到毛主席这一声明的伟大历史意义时，热情地表达了他们对毛主席的无限热爱。他们情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的指引下，鼓起勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，向帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派猛烈开火，消灭一切魔鬼。
    苏丹朋友穆罕默德·瓦菲说，毛主席发表的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，不仅是对刚果人民、非洲人民斗争的鼓舞和支持，而且是对全世界人民争取自由和独立斗争的巨大鼓舞和支持。这个声明发自东方，震撼了整个世界。这个声明是对一切反动势力的沉重打击。
    瓦菲兴奋地说，在毛主席光辉思想的指引下，整个非洲已经沸腾起来，到处响遍了反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的号角。非洲人民清楚地看到，只有依靠毛泽东思想，只有遵循毛主席人民战争思想的教导，才能取得反帝反殖斗争的胜利。他说，非洲革命人民无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。现在非洲许多革命者都拿着毛主席的红书，因为他们知道毛主席的书是人民革命的不可战胜的武器，运用它，世界革命就能取得胜利，就能打倒帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义。
    巴勒斯坦朋友巴思姆·哈克姆说，毛主席的声明，是伟大的马克思主义的文件，是全世界人民进行斗争的思想武器，它象灯塔一样照耀着全世界受压迫人民的前进道路。
    巴思姆·哈克姆愤怒谴责美苏勾结起来镇压阿拉伯人民和世界人民的革命斗争。他说，阿拉伯人民在反对以色列的进攻中，在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，充分认识到，只有团结起来，以毛泽东思想为武器，坚持人民战争，才能打败美帝国主义及其走狗以色列。要反对美帝国主义，就必须反对苏联现代修正主义。我们阿拉伯革命人民决心沿着毛主席指引的道路进行斗争，直到取得最后的胜利。
    日本齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子说，毛主席的声明，给了全世界被压迫民族、被压迫人民以无限的斗争勇气。日本人民深深认识到，美日反动派、苏联现代修正主义和宫本修正主义集团的种种反革命行径，只不过是把绳索套在它们自己的脖子上，搬起石头打自己的脚而已。
    藤川夏子说，日本人民在日本共产党左派的领导下，坚决和全世界人民一道，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指引的斗争大道，奋勇前进。
    哥伦比亚朋友列奥布尔多·克鲁斯说，毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义的威风。毛主席的声明指出了全世界人民前进的道路，号召全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗。全世界人民从毛主席的教导中进一步认识到，打败美帝国主义的根本途径，就是拿起枪杆子，进行革命斗争。在毛主席的号召下，全世界人民的反美斗争日益高涨，民族解放运动蓬勃发展，全世界呈现一片大好的革命形势。
    列奥布尔多·克鲁斯说，美帝国主义是最贪婪、最残暴的国际宪兵，它把手伸得很长很长，到处进行侵略，遭到了全世界人民的强烈反对，它无法逃脱其失败的命运。正如毛主席在声明中指出的，美帝国主义就是把绞索紧紧套在自己脖子上的一只纸老虎。全世界人民从毛主席的英明教导中，受到了无限鼓舞，汲取了无尽的力量。日益觉醒的拉丁美洲人民牢记毛主席的教导，团结起来，坚持斗争，决心把美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派一起埋葬。
    意大利朋友玛丽娅·雷吉斯夫人和朱塞佩·雷吉斯指出，毛主席在三年前发表的这个声明，在全世界越来越深入人心，正在指导着世界革命人民进行反帝反修的胜利斗争。他们说，毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大导师。全世界革命人民团结在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，就能够从胜利走向胜利，打败一切敌人，获得彻底解放。
