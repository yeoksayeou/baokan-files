The Air Force Party Committee recently held a full meeting to seriously study the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, and to discuss how, in the period of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on struggling against selfishness and revisionism, to launch a revolution from the depths of the soul, and to thoroughly reform one's worldview. This is to ensure that the leadership cadres at all levels of the Air Force remain forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever loyal to Vice Chairman Lin, and forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

This meeting was held under the close attention and care of the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, as well as other central leaders, received the comrades attending the meeting, which greatly inspired everyone and gave them tremendous spiritual strength. The comrades attending the meeting repeatedly and word by word studied Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. They took "struggling against selfishness and revisionism" as the key task, using criticism and self-criticism as weapons, and linking their thoughts and the actual struggle between the two lines, to summarize the experiences and lessons from the previous stage of the Cultural Revolution in the Air Force leadership organs and the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work in the troops. Everyone unanimously reflected that this meeting was a great study and discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a meeting to exchange experiences in reforming one's worldview, and a session of Mao Zedong Thought study class.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat must change the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its own worldview. In this respect, the question of who will win between socialism and capitalism has not yet been truly settled." Everyone unanimously agreed that to make the Air Force troops forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the key lies in the thought reform of the leading cadres. The task before us now is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to launch an attack on the "revisionist" and "selfish" elements. On one hand, we must continue to deeply criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, to thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically; on the other hand, we must launch an attack on the "selfish" elements within our own souls, using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome bourgeois individualism and all exploitative class ideologies, to thoroughly reform our worldview, and to firmly establish the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the glorious and great mission bestowed upon us by the times, and it is an extremely important strategic task.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the most fundamental standard for reforming one's worldview. The meeting believed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul, aiming to solve the problem of one's worldview. The core of reforming one's worldview is to overthrow the "selfish" elements and uproot the "revisionist" roots, and to firmly establish the "public" elements. The most fundamental standard of the "public" is to be forever loyal, infinitely loyal, and absolutely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is a very important issue. We must focus on the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought." Chairman Mao is our supreme leader, supreme commander, the highest authority of the proletariat, and the contemporary Lenin. Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our times and the most active Marxism-Leninism. Supporting Chairman Mao is revolutionary, it is great public spirit; opposing Chairman Mao is counter-revolutionary, it is great selfishness. For proletarian revolutionary fighters, loyalty to Chairman Mao is the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental awakening, and the most precious quality, it is the highest revolutionary principle. For a leader, loyalty to Chairman Mao, honestly following Chairman Mao's instructions, is the greatest ability, the greatest skill, and the most qualified leadership; loyalty to Chairman Mao, mastering Mao Zedong Thought, is the only way to truly gain the right to speak and the right to lead. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Everyone said, the history of our Party and our army over the past few decades is a history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and all opportunist lines of "left" and "right" deviations. The focus of the struggle has always been the attitude towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In short, it is the attitude towards Chairman Mao. This struggle must continue and will run through the entire period of socialist transition. The outcome of the struggle will determine the future and destiny of our Party, our country, and the world. There are countless things and countless changes in the situation. Grasping this one point is grasping the most fundamental issue, and forgetting this one point is the greatest confusion.

Loyalty to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao, means following Mao Zedong Thought. The process of following Chairman Mao is the process of arming and reforming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting pointed out that some of our comrades have come from the democratic revolution and lack ideological preparation for continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The situation is new, but the perspective is still old, so they do not fully understand the Cultural Revolution and are not prepared for the current revolution, which is a revolution against those who have already made the revolution. Therefore, to follow Chairman Mao, we must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, deeply understand and master Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and principles on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, constantly regard ourselves as an object of the revolution. While reforming the objective world, we must also reform our subjective world.

"The Three Articles" are the best treasures for reforming one's worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The meeting pointed out that whether a leading cadre can achieve this fundamental transformation relates to whether one can forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and whether one can study, reform, and follow until old age. The best treasure for achieving this fundamental transformation is "The Three Articles." Vice Chairman Lin instructed us that "The Three Articles" should be studied by cadres at all levels, and after studying, they should be applied to promote thought reform. To launch a revolution from the depths of the soul, "The Three Articles" are the weapons for the revolution; to launch an attack on the "selfish" elements, "The Three Articles" are the weapons for the attack; in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, "The Three Articles" play the greatest role. The study of "The Three Articles" must focus on the "application" aspect. Especially in the struggle between the two lines, in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, we must study and apply "The Three Articles" diligently. The study of "The Three Articles" is not only to be firm in daily life but more importantly to be firm in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and to dedicate oneself to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in death, is the most fundamental purpose of studying "The Three Articles" and the most important sign of proletarian worldview.

The meeting believed that as long as we follow Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to "study 'The Three Articles' as a motto," and keep "The Three Articles" in mind, always use them as a reference, and keep "two rulers" with us, always measure ourselves, and keep "three images" in mind, always compare ourselves, we can gradually eliminate the "selfish" elements and cleanse the dirt and impurities from the depths of our souls, and the proletarian worldview can truly be established in our minds.

Criticism and self-criticism are effective weapons for reforming one's worldview. The meeting fully used the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to struggle against the "revisionist" and "selfish" elements. Everyone unanimously agreed that whether a leading cadre has the spirit of criticism and self-criticism is a manifestation of whether they have revolutionary spirit and principles; for a leading cadre, whether they have the spirit of criticism and self-criticism is a manifestation of whether they have fighting spirit and vitality. "Revisionism is a disaster, selfishness is the root." "If the 'selfish' elements are not overthrown, errors will not be corrected, revisionism will not be overcome, and prevention of revisionism will not be effective." We must struggle against the "selfish" elements and there is no room for compromise. We must overthrow the "selfish" elements and rebel against them, and we must not engage in reformism or opportunism. We must launch an offensive, a close combat, and not a defensive battle. To launch a revolution from the depths of the soul, the so-called "revolution" is not peaceful. To thoroughly reform one's worldview, one must undergo long-term and even painful tempering.

Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. If one does not revolutionize oneself, the revolution will not be successful." The meeting emphasized that one must revolutionize oneself, and if one does not revolutionize oneself, others will have to revolutionize them. A leading cadre must maintain their integrity and not change their colors. They must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, practice high self-awareness, self-revolution, and thorough revolutionary spirit, actively engage in self-criticism, consciously cleanse their impurities, promote thought reform, and closely follow the footsteps of our great leader Chairman Mao.

The fiery class struggle of the masses is the best battlefield for reforming one's worldview. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has once again proven that leading cadres going among the masses, experiencing hardships, and participating in the revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people is the fundamental way to achieve thought reform.

Everyone believed that whether to open the door for revolution or to close the door for self-cultivation is not a matter of two methods but of two stances, and it is an important part of the struggle between the two lines. Opening the door for revolution means becoming more public; closing the door for self-cultivation means becoming more revisionist. Sitting in a room is a lifetime of not being able to learn Mao Zedong Thought. Floating above all the time, the more one puts on airs, the more special one's life becomes, and one will inevitably become detached from reality and from the masses, slowly becoming revisionist.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the future, cadres should go down to the lower levels to walk around and see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything, becoming students of the masses." The meeting required that leading cadres at all levels of the Air Force must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and go deep into the fiery class struggle of the masses. This is a fundamental measure to prevent and guard against revisionism. The older one's experience, the higher one's position, and the greater one's responsibility, the more one must correctly treat oneself, the more one must eliminate officialism, arrogance, and special privileges, and forever be an ordinary laborer, forever be a student of the masses, and forever be heart to heart with the masses.

Going among the masses means going to the places where class struggle is the fiercest and most intense. Every moment of struggle there contains the struggle between the public and the selfish, and it touches the soul of a person. Only in the stormy class struggle can one learn Chairman Mao's works most vividly, discover one's own problems most quickly, and receive the greatest education and tempering; only then can one thoroughly reform one's worldview and forge an unchanging red heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

The comrades attending the meeting decided that under the good situation both domestically and internationally, they would resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carry the revolution to the end, and turn the Air Force into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    空军党委全体会议以斗私批修为纲总结文化大革命和“三支”“两军”经验
    忠于毛主席是高于一切的革命大节
    各级领导一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，特别要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，到火热的群众斗争中去，彻底改造世界观，搞好思想革命化，在文化大革命中立新功，把空军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校
    新华社二十六日讯　中国人民解放军空军党委最近召开全体会议，认真学习伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，深入讨论在无产阶级专政下继续革命的时期，如何遵照毛主席要斗私，批修的教导，从灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，使空军各级领导班子永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席革命路线，永远忠于林副主席，永远忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。
    这次会议，是在伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲切关怀下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势下召开的。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，以及中央其他领导同志，接见了出席会议的同志，使大家受到了极大的鼓舞，得到了巨大的精神力量。到会同志反复地、逐字逐句地学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的极为重要的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以批评和自我批评为武器，联系思想实际和两条路线斗争的实际，总结了空军领导机关前一阶段文化大革命运动和部队“三支”“两军”工作的经验教训。大家一致反映，这次会议是对毛主席最新指示的一次大学习，大讨论，是一次改造世界观的经验交流会，是一期毛泽东思想学习班。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。在这一方面，社会主义和资本主义之间谁胜谁负的问题还没有真正解决。”大家一致认为，要使空军部队永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，关键在于领导干部思想革命化。当前摆在我们面前的任务，就是要跟紧毛主席的伟大战略部署，向“修”字、“私”字进一步展开进攻。一方面对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿继续深入展开大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底地把他们批倒斗臭；一方面要向自己灵魂深处的“私”字展开进攻战，用毛泽东思想战胜资产阶级个人主义和一切剥削阶级思想，彻底改造世界观，大树特树我们伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这是时代赋予我们的光荣而伟大的使命，是极端重要的战略任务。
    忠于毛主席是改造世界观的最根本标准。会议认为，无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。改造世界观的核心，就是要斗倒“私”字，挖掉“修”根，大立“公”字。公的最根本标准，就是要永远忠于、无限忠于和绝对忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席。
    林副主席指示我们：“对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是一个很重要的问题。我们就是要抓对毛主席的态度、对毛泽东思想的态度问题。”毛主席是我们的最高领袖，最高统帅，是无产阶级的最高权威，是当代的列宁。毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜，是最高最活的马克思列宁主义。拥护毛主席就是革命，就是大公，大好；反对毛主席就是反革命，就是大私，大坏。对无产阶级革命战士说来，忠于毛主席是最根本的立场，最根本的觉悟，最宝贵的品质，是高于一切的革命大节。对一个领导者说来，忠于毛主席，老老实实照毛主席指示办事，是最大的才能，最大的本事，最称职的领导；忠于毛主席，掌握毛泽东思想，才能真正取得发言权和领导权。我们一定要以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    大家说，我党我军几十年的历史，就是一部以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线战胜一切“左”右倾机会主义路线的斗争史。斗争的焦点，始终是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线，一句话，对毛主席的态度问题。这个斗争还要继续下去，将贯串于整个社会主义过渡时期，斗争的结局如何，决定着我们党、国家和世界的前途和命运。事情千头万绪，情况千变万化，抓住这一条就抓住了最根本，忘记了这一条就是最大的糊涂人。
    忠于毛主席，跟毛主席走，就要跟上毛泽东思想。跟毛主席走的过程，就是用毛泽东思想武装自己、改造自己的过程。会议指出，我们一些同志是从民主革命走过来的，对在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命缺乏思想准备。情况是新情况，眼光还是老眼光，就对文化大革命不大理解，对现在的革命是革我们原来革过命的命没准备。因此，要跟上毛主席，必须认真地活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，深刻理解和掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象，在改造客观世界的同时改造自己的主观世界。
    “老三篇”是改造世界观的最好法宝。毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。会议指出，一个领导干部能不能实现这个根本的转变，关系到能否永远忠于毛主席，能否做到老，学到老，改到老，跟到老的问题。而实现这个根本的转变的最好法宝，就是“老三篇”。林副主席指示我们，“老三篇”那一级干部都要学，学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。从灵魂深处爆发革命，“老三篇”是爆发革命的武器；向“私”字展开进攻战，“老三篇”是进攻的武器；在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，“老三篇”发挥着最巨大的威力。学习“老三篇”，必须在“用”字上狠下功夫。特别是要在两条路线斗争中狠学狠用，在斗私批修中狠学狠用。学“老三篇”，不只是要在日常生活中“过得硬”，首要的是要在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中“过得硬”。无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线，生为毛主席革命路线战斗，死为毛主席革命路线献身，是学习“老三篇”最根本目的，是无产阶级世界观最重要的标志。
    会议认为，只要我们遵照林副主席“要把‘老三篇’作为座右铭来学”的指示，把“老三篇”刻在脑子里经常照，把“两把尺子”装在身上经常量，把“三个形象”放在心里经常比，就能把“私”字一点一点地磨掉，把灵魂深处的污泥浊水冲刷得干干净净，无产阶级世界观就能在我们的头脑里真正确立起来。
    批评和自我批评是改造世界观的有效武器。会议充分运用了批评和自我批评的武器，向“修”字，“私”字进行了斗争。大家一致认为，有无批评和自我批评精神，对一个领导干部说来，是有无革命性、原则性的表现；对一个领导班子说来，是有无战斗力、生命力的表现。“修是祸，私是根”，“‘私’字斗不倒，错误断不了，反修反不掉，防修防不好”。对“私”字就要斗，没有什么客气可讲。革“私”字的命，造“私”字的反，不能搞改良主义、机会主义，要打进攻战，白刃战，不能打防御战。从灵魂深处爆发革命，所谓爆发，就不是和平的。彻底改造世界观，必须经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨炼。
    林副主席指示我们：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”会议强调指出，命是一定要革的，自己不革，就只能叫群众来革。一个领导干部要保持晚节，不变颜色，就要认真地活学活用毛主席著作，发扬高度的自觉革命，自我革命，彻底革命精神，主动地多作自我批评，自觉地不断地清洗自己的污浊，搞好思想革命化，紧紧跟上我们伟大统帅毛主席的前进步伐。
    火热的群众革命斗争是改造世界观的最好战场。一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，又一次证明了，领导干部到群众里面去经风雨，见世面，投身于亿万革命群众运动之中，是实现思想革命化的根本途径。
    大家认为，开门革命还是闭门修养，不是两种方法问题，而是两种立场问题，是两条路线斗争的一个重要内容。开门革命，越革越公；闭门修养，越养越修。坐在房子里，是一辈子也学不到毛泽东思想的。整天浮在上面，架子越摆越大，生活越来越特殊，就必然脱离实际，脱离群众，慢慢慢慢“修”过去。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”会议要求空军各级领导干部必须遵照毛主席的教导，深入到火热的群众斗争中去。这是反修防修的一项根本措施。资格越老，地位越高，担负的责任越大，越要正确地对待自己，越要打掉官气、娇气、特殊化，永远做一个普通劳动者，永远做群众的小学生，永远和群众心连心。
    到群众中去，就要到阶级斗争最火热、最激烈的地方。那里斗争的每一刹那，都包含着公与私的斗争，都触及到人的灵魂。只有在阶级斗争的暴风骤雨中，才能把毛主席著作学得最活，发现自己身上的毛病最快，受到的教育和锻炼最大；才能彻底改造世界观，才能炼成一颗永不褪色的忠于毛主席的红心。
    到会同志决心在国内外一派大好形势下，坚决响应林副主席伟大号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把空军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
