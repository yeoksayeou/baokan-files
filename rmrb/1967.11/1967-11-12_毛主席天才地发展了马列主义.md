The organ of the Danish Communist Working Group, *The Line*, recently published an article entitled "Fifty Years of the October Revolution!" in which it enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao for further developing Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The article first pointed out that the October Revolution proved in practice the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism regarding proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. It then emphasized: "Lenin, with his genius and creativity, applied the scientific method and universal truths of Marxism to the realities of Russia and the international situation at that time. Thus, he further developed Marxism, bringing it to the stage of Marxism-Leninism. Through his practical revolutionary activities and his theoretical summation of proletarian experience, he discovered new universal truths and recorded them in his works.

"Mao Zedong, with his genius and creativity, applies Marxism-Leninism to the realities of China and the contemporary international situation. Thus, he further develops Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to the stage of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Through his practical revolutionary activities and his theoretical summation of proletarian experience, he discovers and continues to discover new universal truths and records them in his works."

In discussing the lessons that Chairman Mao and the Chinese revolution led by him have given to Western European communists, the article said: "Only Mao Zedong Thought has taught us to correctly understand the lessons of the October Revolution. Only Mao Zedong Thought has taught us to correctly understand Lenin's works."

The article said that while the Soviet revisionist leading clique was "celebrating" the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution by speeding up the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, "we must use Mao Zedong Thought to once again study—and this time truly understand—Lenin's analysis of the objective realities of Russia and the world at that time, so as to learn how to analyze the capitalist realities of Denmark and Western Europe."

The article concluded with enthusiastic cheers: "Long live the great October Socialist Revolution! Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!"

    丹麦共产主义工作小组机关报热情欢呼马列主义、毛泽东思想万岁
    毛主席天才地发展了马列主义
    据新华社讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产主义工作小组机关报《方针报》，最近在一篇题为《十月革命五十年！》的文章中，热烈赞扬毛主席进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，使它达到了毛泽东思想的新阶段。
    文章首先指出，十月革命从实践上证明了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政等一系列基本原理。接着，文章强调说：“列宁天才地、创造性地把马克思主义的科学方法及其普遍真理运用到了俄国的现实和当时的国际现实。这样，他便进一步发展了马克思主义，使它达到了马克思列宁主义的新阶段。通过他的实际革命活动和他在理论上对无产阶级经验的总结，他发现了新的普遍真理，并在他的著作中写下了这些真理。
      “毛泽东天才地、创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用到了而且仍然在运用到中国的现实和当代的国际现实。这样，他便进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，而且已经使它达到了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新阶段。通过他的实际革命活动和他在理论上对无产阶级经验的总结，他发现了而且仍然在发现着新的普遍真理，并在他的著作中写下了这些真理。”
    文章在谈到毛主席和毛主席领导的中国革命给予西欧共产党人的教益时说：“只有毛泽东思想教会了我们正确地理解十月革命给我们的教诲。只有毛泽东思想教会了我们正确地理解列宁的著作。”
    文章说，当苏联修正主义领导集团用加紧在苏联全面复辟资本主义来“庆祝”十月革命五十周年的时候，“我们必须运用毛泽东思想来再一次学习——而且这一次是要真正理解——列宁对当时俄国和全世界的客观现实的分析，从而学会如何分析丹麦和西欧的资本主义现实”。
    文章在结束时热情欢呼：“伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！”“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”
