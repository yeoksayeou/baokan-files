Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 30th: The newly built large rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have completed the first quarter's national production plan five and eight days ahead of schedule, respectively. In the first quarter of this year, they produced a large number of seamless steel tubes, heavy rails, and round steel for the country.

    With the help of Soviet experts, the technical level of the workers in these two plants has been continuously improving. Now the workers in the seamless steel tube plant are able to carry out production independently and can produce thirteen different calibers of seamless steel tubes. Compared with December of last year, the output per hour has now increased by 88 percent. Due to technical improvements, the rate of first-class products in the seamless steel tube production in the first quarter has also exceeded the national plan by 9 percent.

    After successfully trial-rolling channel steel, the large rolling mill is now able to produce heavy rails, tube billets, round steel, channel steel, and other products. The level of workers' mastery of automated machines is also constantly improving. The efficiency of changing rolling mill rolls has increased five times compared to when production started, and the proportion of first-class products is also very high. The large rolling mill also paid attention to careful calculation and strict budgeting in production, saving 544 tons of steel billets in February alone, thus significantly reducing the cost of steel.

    大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂完成首季生产计划
    【新华社鞍山三十日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，已先后提前五天和八天完成了第一季度国家生产计划。它们在今年第一季度中为国家生产了大批的无缝钢管、重型钢轨和圆钢。
    这两厂在苏联专家帮助下，职工的技术水平不断提高。现在无缝钢管厂职工已能独立地进行生产，并能生产十三种不同口径的无缝钢管。和去年十二月份比较，现在每小时的产量已提高百分之八十八。由于技术上的改进，第一季度无缝钢管生产的一级品的比率也已超过国家计划百分之九。
    大型轧钢厂试轧槽钢成功后，现在已能生产重型钢轨、管坯、圆钢、槽钢等产品。职工掌握自动化机器的水平也在不断提高，轧钢机换轧辊的效率比开工生产时已提高了五倍，产品中的一级品也占很高的比率。大型轧钢厂在生产中并注意精打细算，仅二月份就节省了五百四十四吨钢坯，因而使钢材的成本降低不少。
