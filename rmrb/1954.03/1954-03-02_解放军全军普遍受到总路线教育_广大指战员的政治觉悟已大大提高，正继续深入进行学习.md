Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: The movement to vigorously promote the general line of the state during the transition period throughout the Chinese People's Liberation Army has come to an end, and will enter a stage of in-depth study from March.

Over the past three months, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have universally received education on the general line. The political consciousness of cadres and soldiers has been greatly enhanced, and they have a clearer understanding of the goals of our people's struggle and the current tasks of our army. Everyone understands and clearly recognizes that building socialism is not a distant matter, but is being realized step by step right before our eyes. "Building a socialist society cannot wait," and relies on everyone's efforts. Therefore, everyone is full of confidence and vigor in their work. Under the slogan "Everything for Socialism," the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have greatly developed their work enthusiasm and creativity, and a new atmosphere is emerging in all aspects of the troops. In military training, cadres and soldiers, unafraid of the cold weather, practice diligently and actively study the advanced military science and technology of the Soviet Union. Cadres and soldiers guarding land, sea, and air defenses link their responsibilities with the realization of the general line. They have expressed their determination to heighten vigilance, be loyal to their duties, and ensure that the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation proceed smoothly in a safe environment.

After receiving education on the general line, all cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have more actively responded to various national calls and implemented various national policies, and have widely publicized them to the masses. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers enthusiastically purchased national economic construction bonds and overfulfilled the subscription plan in a short period of time. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have also written letters mobilizing their families to sell their surplus grain to the state and actively participate in agricultural production mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives. Many cadres and soldiers took advantage of family visits to the troops or helped the local people with their daily labor to promote the general line to them. Many troop leading organs sent working groups to assist local party committees and governments in publicizing the general line and grain policies. For example, the military sub-districts under the Jiangsu Military Region alone successively transferred 228 cadres in early December to form 43 working groups to work in the countryside, achieving great results.

The propaganda and education movement of the general line has also greatly promoted the troop's thrift movement. The financial expenditures of various troop organs have been carefully calculated, and the rear service departments have actively cleared warehouses, checked accounts, reviewed supply standards, utilized waste products, and promoted thrift experience, saving wealth for the country bit by bit.

At present, the propaganda of the general line in the People's Liberation Army has come to an end. From March, the broad masses of cadres will enter a stage of in-depth study. The general line will also be the main content of political education among soldiers, and will be combined with the Party's important resolutions, policies, and the current tasks of the troops to carry out education, so that all tasks of the army can follow and improve along the general line.

    解放军全军普遍受到总路线教育
    广大指战员的政治觉悟已大大提高，正继续深入进行学习
   【新华社二十八日讯】中国人民解放军中全军大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期总路线的运动已告一段落，从三月份起将转入深入学习阶段。
    近三个月来，人民解放军广大干部、战士普遍地受到了总路线的教育。干部、战士的政治觉悟已大大提高，对我国人民的奋斗目标和我军当前任务有了更加明确的认识。大家明白认清了建设社会主义并不是遥远的事，而是眼前就在一步步地实现，“建设社会主义社会不能等待”，要靠大家努力，因而大家对自己的工作充满信心和朝气。广大干部、战士在“一切为了社会主义”的口号下，大大地发挥了工作积极性和创造精神，部队各方面都呈现着新的气象。在军事训练中，干部、战士不怕天寒地冻，认真操练，积极学习苏联的先进军事科学和技术，守卫着陆防、海防、空防的干部、战士更把自己的职责和实现总路线联系起来，他们纷纷表示决心，要提高警惕，忠于职守，使国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造在安全的环境中顺利进行。
    人民解放军的全体干部、战士在受到总路线的教育后，更加积极地响应国家的各项号召和执行国家的各项政策，并广泛地向群众进行宣传。广大干部、战士踊跃认购国家经济建设公债，并在短期内超额完成了认购计划。广大干部、战士还纷纷写信动员家属把余粮卖给国家，积极参加农业生产互助组或农业生产合作社；许多干部、战士趁家属来部队看望的机会或在帮助驻地人民进行日常劳动中向他们宣传总路线；许多部队领导机关派出了工作组协助当地党委和政府宣传总路线和粮食政策，仅江苏军区所属各军分区就在十二月初先后抽调了二百二十八名干部，组成了四十三个工作组下乡工作，取得了很大成绩。
    总路线的宣传教育运动也大大地推动了部队的节约运动。各部队机关的经费开支都做到了精打细算，各后方勤务部门都积极清理仓库、检查账目、审核供给标准、利用废品，并推广节约经验，一点一滴地为国家节省财富。
    目前，人民解放军中总路线的宣传已经告一段落，从三月份起，广大干部将转入深入学习的阶段，在战士中亦将以总路线作为政治教育的主要内容，同时结合党的重要决议、政策和部队当前任务进行教育，使全军各项工作都能遵循着总路线前进和提高。
