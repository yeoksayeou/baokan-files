China's female workforce is growing steadily, becoming an important force in industrial production.

    As the motherland enters large-scale economic construction, China's female workforce is growing steadily, and they have become an important force in industrial production. Many of them have become advanced figures and model workers in creative labor.

    Due to the needs of the rapid development of national industry, many women have continuously stepped onto the industrial production front from rural areas, schools, and families. Historically, many jobs that women have never done before are now being undertaken by them. According to statistics, in terms of civil engineering and construction, the number of female workers in the four major regions of North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest China reached more than 16,300 in 1953. In terms of national railway transportation, the number increased by 20% in 1953 compared to 1952. In China's newest Anshan Iron and Steel Company's factories and mines, there are now more than 6,000 female employees. In Shanghai's machinery industry, there were no female workers in the past, but now there are 10,000 female workers. In Dalian City's 59 types of heavy machinery technical operation departments, there are also female workers. Now, whether it is by the steelmaking furnace, in the machine workshop, in the electrical room, on the construction site, or on the motherland's water and land transportation lines, you can see women of New China engaged in creative labor skillfully and intently.

    Women, in various industrial production posts, contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland with high labor enthusiasm. In the textile industry, where female workers account for more than 60%, female workers, together with male workers, overfulfilled the 1953 production plan in order to produce a large number of the most durable and beautiful yarn and cloth. The technical level of female textile workers is also constantly improving. In 1949, female workers in state-owned cotton mills could only operate an average of 2 to 4 ordinary looms and 12 to 16 automatic looms, but in 1953 they reached the level of operating 8 ordinary looms and 26 automatic looms. The spindle watching ability has also increased from an average of 300 to 400 spindles per person in 1949 to 600 spindles per person. Many outstanding female textile workers can watch more than 1,000 spindles. Female employees in many other industrial positions are also mastering new technologies with tenacious spirit. In Anshan Iron and Steel Company, there are many young women from rural areas, schools, and female soldiers transferred from the army. After hard work, they quickly mastered many first-class technologies. Ding Xiuying, a 17-year-old female operator working on the No. 1 operating platform of the heating furnace in the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory, was a rural girl who had never even seen a factory a little over a year ago, but now she can operate the most modern and complex machines. Many female foundry workers, female fitters, female lathe operators, female electrical workers, and female welders have also grown rapidly, and many advanced figures have emerged. Wu Yulan of the Electrical Repair Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, leading an instrument repair team, created two types of relays that were in short supply in the factory and created and improved seven production methods, greatly improving production efficiency and product quality. This team has become a model team in Anshan, and Wu Yulan was also selected as a special-class labor model in Anshan City in 1953. In the basic construction sector, many brave and diligent female geologists, female drillers, and female surveyors are traversing thousands of mountains and rivers to explore the motherland's treasures and engage in the survey of various huge projects. Such as the nationally famous "March 8th" Women's Survey Team participating in the Huai River Foziling Reservoir Project, the "March 8th" Women's Survey Team of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry Design Company, etc., they often work selflessly regardless of hardship, braving wind, frost, rain, and snow. In the state-owned commercial and trade departments, many female model shop assistants and female model salespersons have also emerged in recent years. They enthusiastically serve customers in urban and rural areas and strive to strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and accelerate the turnover of national funds. Liu Shuzhen's team in the Second Store of Shenyang Department Store Company overfulfilled the plan for selling hardware and electrical materials every quarter, and because of improved business management, the capital turnover rate was shortened from once every 88 days to once every 22 days.

    Under the care and cultivation of the Communist Party and the People's Government, women workers have made great progress in politics, technology, and culture in recent years. Many female workers have taken up work in trade unions and the Communist Youth League. The number of female workers promoted to technicians, engineers, and administrative leading cadres is increasing. In the general election movement, a large number of outstanding female workers were loved by the masses and elected as people's representatives. Many female workers with a high degree of political awareness in various jobs have joined the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In order to further adapt to the needs of the motherland's construction, female workers have stepped up their spare-time political, technical, and cultural studies. In Beijing last year, more than 1,200 female workers were sent to study at the Party School of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Workers' School of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions.

    With the development of production, the living and welfare benefits of female workers have been significantly improved. Many factories have established and expanded nurseries and developed a variety of childcare organizations, so that female workers can concentrate on production. In order to reduce the incidence of gynecological diseases and miscarriages among female workers, more than 40 female worker health rooms have been established in state-owned textile factories across the country. Many factories have strengthened the publicity of women and infant hygiene knowledge, and in factories in larger cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Shanghai, physical examinations are often conducted for female workers before and after childbirth, and lectures on women and infant hygiene are held. Some factories also implement a menstrual card registration system, which has played a great role in protecting the health of female workers. Many factories have also set up canteens for pregnant women and lactation rooms. In recent years, the footprints of female labor models who are recuperating often remain in scenic areas such as Qingdao and West Lake.

    我国女工队伍日益壮大
    成为工业生产上一支重要力量
    随着祖国进入大规模的经济建设，我国女工的队伍日益壮大，她们已成为工业生产上一支重要的力量。其中许多人在创造性的劳动中并成为先进人物和劳动模范。
    由于国家工业迅速发展的需要，许多妇女从农村、从学校、从家庭源源地走上了工业生产战线。历史上很多从来没有妇女做过的工作，现在也由她们担当起来了。据统计，在土木建筑工程方面，一九五三年华北、华东、中南、西南四个大区的女工已达一万六千三百多人。在全国铁路运输方面一九五三年比一九五二年增加了百分之二十。在我国最新型的鞍山钢铁公司的工厂和矿山中现在已有六千多名女职工。上海市的机械工业过去没有女工，现在已有一万名女工。大连市的五十九种重型机械的技术操作部门，也都有了女工。现在，不论在炼钢炉旁、机器车间、电器室里、建筑工地上以及祖国的水、陆运输线上，都可以看到新中国妇女在熟练而紧张地从事着创造性的劳动。
    妇女们在工业生产的各个岗位上，以高度的劳动热情，为祖国的建设贡献出自己的力量。在女工占百分之六十以上的纺织工业中，女工们为了生产出大量的最耐用最漂亮的纱布，她们和男工一道超额完成了一九五三年的生产计划。纺织女工们的技术水平也在不断提高。一九四九年国营棉纺厂女工平均只能看普通布机二台到四台、自动布机十二台到十六台，一九五三年就达到看普通布机八台，看自动布机二十六台的水平。看锭能力也由一九四九年平均每人看三百锭到四百锭提高到每人看六百锭。许多优秀的纺织女工看锭能力达到一千多锭。在其它许多工业岗位上的女职工们也都以顽强的精神，去掌握新的技术。鞍山钢铁公司里就有着许多来自农村、来自学校的青年妇女和部队转业来的女战士，她们经过刻苦的努力，很快就掌握了许多头等的技术。在鞍山无缝钢管厂加热炉第一号操作台上工作的十七岁的女运转工丁秀英，一年多以前还是一个连工厂都没看见过的农村姑娘，但是现在她已能操纵最现代化的复杂的机器了。许多女铸造工、女钳工、女车床工、女电器工、女电焊工也都迅速的成长起来，并出现了许多先进的人物。鞍山钢铁公司电修厂的武玉兰，领导着一个计器修理小组，曾经创造出两种厂内十分缺乏的继电器，并创造和改进了七种生产方法，大大提高了生产效率和产品质量。这个小组已成为鞍山的模范小组，武玉兰也在一九五三年被选为鞍山市特等劳动模范。在基本建设部门中，许多勇敢而勤劳的女地质勘察家、女钻探家、女测量员们正踏遍千山万水去探寻祖国的宝藏和从事各种巨大工程的勘察。如全国闻名的参加淮河佛子岭水库工程的“三八”女子勘察队，中央人民政府重工业部设计公司测量队“三八”女子测量分队等，她们经常是不辞艰苦，冒着风霜雨雪而忘我地劳动。在国营商业贸易部门，几年来也出现了许多女模范店员，女模范推销员。她们热情地为城乡的顾客们服务，并为了加强城乡物资的交流、加速国家资金的周转而努力。沈阳市百货公司第二商店刘淑珍小组，推销五金电料，每季都超额完成计划，并且因为改进经营管理，使资金周转率从八十八天周转一次缩短到二十二天一次。
    在共产党和人民政府的关心和培养下，女工们几年来在政治、技术、文化等方面都有很大的提高。不少女工担任了工会和青年团的工作。女工提升为技术员、工程师和行政领导干部的正日益增多。在普选运动中，大批优秀的女工受到群众的爱戴，当选为人民代表。各种工作中那些具有高度政治觉悟的女工，有许多已加入了中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团。为了进一步适应祖国建设的需要，女工们都加紧了业余的政治、技术和文化的学习。北京市去年有一千二百多名女工被送到中国共产党北京市委员会党校和北京市总工会职工学校学习。
    随着生产的发展，女工的生活福利待遇已有了显著的改善。许多工厂都建立和扩大了托儿所，并发展了多种多样的托儿组织，使女工们能安心进行生产。为了减少女工患妇科病和流产的现象，全国国营的纺织工厂已设立了四十多个女工卫生室。许多厂加强了妇婴卫生常识的宣传工作，在北京、天津、沈阳、上海等较大城市的工厂中经常为女工进行产前产后的身体检查，举办妇婴卫生讲座等。有些工厂并推行月经卡片登记制度，对保护女工的身体健康起了很大作用。许多工厂并设置了孕妇食堂、哺乳室。近年来，在青岛、西湖等风景幽美的地区，经常留下休养的女劳动模范们的足迹。
