The "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and Reclaiming Virgin and Idle Lands" adopted by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) after listening to the report by Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, published in "Pravda" yesterday, will occupy a very important place in the history of our people's struggle to build a communist society.

For the past half year, the Party and the government have formulated and successfully implemented a series of measures to rapidly improve agriculture. The resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and the subsequent decisions passed by the government and the CPSU Central Committee put forward a detailed program for developing public animal husbandry, expanding the production of potatoes and vegetables, improving the work of machine tractor stations and enhancing their role in collective farm production, and strengthening the leadership of Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs over agriculture.

Currently, the Party is arming collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms with a concrete fighting program for further developing the grain economy, which constitutes the foundation of the entire agricultural production.

The September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee put forward the most urgent task for the entire people under the current conditions: on the basis of the strong development of socialist heavy industry, to fully satisfy the growing demands of our people for consumer goods within the next two to three years and to ensure the supply of raw materials to light industry and the food industry.

Following the resolution of the plenary session, the Party and Soviet organs have carried out tremendous work over the past period, creating the necessary conditions for fulfilling the task of vigorously improving all sectors of agriculture. Collective farmers, machine tractor stations, and state farm workers have completed autumn field work better than in previous years.

The measures taken by the Party and the government to increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of agricultural production have greatly increased the income of farmers. The income of collective farms and collective farmers increased by more than 13 billion rubles in the past year.

In the struggle to implement the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Party paid close attention to cadres, especially the cadres of machine tractor stations, which play a decisive role in agriculture. After the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, approximately 1.25 million tractor drivers, tractor team leaders, mechanics operating complex agricultural machinery, and other personnel were included in the fixed staff of machine tractor stations. In recent months, more than 100,000 agronomists and animal husbandry specialists have been dispatched to machine tractor stations to serve collective farms. Twenty-three thousand engineers and technicians have been transferred from industry and other sectors of the national economy to work in machine tractor stations.

Currently, the plan to strengthen the material production base of machine tractor stations is being successfully implemented.

The great Lenin envisioned the day when there would be 100,000 tractors in our country. Now we already have millions of tractors. This demonstrates the great power of socialist industry, especially heavy industry, which was, is, and remains the foundation of our peaceful economic prosperity and the foundation of our national defense.

The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee cited the work that has been completed, while also pointing out the serious shortcomings that exist in the practical work of Party organizations, Soviet organs, and agricultural organs in implementing the resolution of the Central Committee's September Plenary Session and the subsequent decisions on agricultural issues passed by the Party and the government. Many states have not yet fully staffed the machine tractor stations, nor have they properly allocated expert cadres, so that many backward collective farms with weak economic strength still lack experts. Only a few Party organizations have begun to strengthen collective farms by appointing experienced farm chairmen, familiar with the business, and good at leading the collective farmers to the upsurge of the public economy.

The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee pointed out that the heads of the Ministry of Machine Building Industry and many factory directors have not satisfactorily completed the production tasks of agricultural machinery, and they have not adopted an attitude that proceeds from the interests of the country on this issue.

To this day, Party organizations have not eliminated the phenomenon of irresponsibility in agricultural leadership.

The six months since the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee is a short period of time. However, during this short period, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have done a tremendous amount of work. The current task is to rely on the achievements already made and make a great leap forward in expanding agricultural production, especially in developing grain production. The Party calls on the entire Soviet people to work together to accomplish this task.

The "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and Reclaiming Virgin and Idle Lands" adopted by the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee sets out the tasks for grain production, the most important sector of socialist agriculture, and points out the path to victory.

The resolution states: "In order to fulfill the national task put forward by the Party and the government of rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods nationwide, it is of particular importance to further develop grain, which is the basis of the entire agricultural production."

The further upsurge of all other sectors of agriculture, the satisfaction of the growing needs of residents and the entire national economy, all depend on the success of grain economy development.

At the same time, as the resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee points out, the current level of grain production, whether in terms of total harvest or marketable volume, cannot meet the growing needs of the national economy. The amount of grain held by the state does not correspond to the need for grain.

The serious errors made by the Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms in formulating the plan for sown acreage, especially in formulating the plan for sown acreage of grain and pasture, are one of the fundamental reasons why the level of development of grain production does not meet the growing need for grain by residents and the national economy. Due to the rigid implementation of the pasture crop rotation system without considering the characteristics of various regions of the country, the sown acreage of grain in Ukraine, the North Caucasus region, the Volga River Basin, and the Central Black Earth Belt has been reduced.

A top priority task facing socialist agriculture and the entire country is to rapidly expand grain production so that, in the next few years, the state can control 35 to 40 percent more grain in terms of grain procurement and acquisition than in 1953.

The resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee points out the ways to accomplish this task. In expanding grain production, in addition to increasing the yield of grain, which is the main task of agriculture, the reclamation of new land is also of great significance. In the short term, expanding the sown acreage of grain by reclaiming idle and virgin lands in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and parts of the North Caucasus is an important and fully realistic source of increasing grain production.

The most important national task put forward by the Party is to expand the sown acreage of grain by at least 13 million hectares by reclaiming idle and virgin lands in 1954-1955. In 1955, 1.1 to 1.2 billion poods of grain should be obtained from these cultivated lands, including 800 to 900 million poods of marketable grain.

The state has allocated first-class machinery and equipment for land reclamation. Now, the main issue is people, is cadres. The responsibility of Party, Soviet, trade union, and youth league organizations at all levels is to select and dispatch experienced leaders, experts, and skilled workers to the state farms and machine tractor stations that are reclaiming new land this year, based on extensive explanatory work. The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved the initiative of the Youth League organization to select 100,000 mechanics from Youth League members and youth on a voluntary basis to participate in the reclamation of virgin and idle lands.

The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee exposed the serious shortcomings in the formulation of agricultural plans and the distribution of crop sown acreage. The Soviet State Planning Committee, the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, and the Soviet Ministry of State Farms have implemented an erroneous line in formulating agricultural plans. That is, in the arid and semi-arid regions of the southern Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the North Caucasus, and in the southeastern regions of our country, the sown acreage of low-yielding perennial pastures was unjustifiably expanded, while the sown acreage of grain, especially corn, beans, rice crops, and grain forage crops, was greatly reduced.

These errors must be resolutely eliminated and the distribution of cultivated land must be changed so that the southern and southeastern regions, starting from 1954, reduce the sown and cultivated acreage of low-yielding perennial pastures and drastically expand the sown acreage of grain, especially rice crops, beans, and grain forage crops.

In addition to formulating a number of measures to increase grain production, the resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee also formulated various methods to increase the production of industrial raw material crops, develop orchard and grape cultivation, and consolidate the feed base for animal husbandry.

State farms play an important role in realizing the various major tasks facing agriculture. They have every possibility to become model and highly profitable farms. However, many state farms have not made good use of their land and have supplied the country with very little grain, meat, milk, wool, and other products.

The backward state of many state farms and the lack of care for the production of state farms, especially grain production, are the result of the poor leadership of the Soviet Ministry of State Farms and its indifferent attitude toward adopting advanced experiences. The Soviet Ministry of State Farms has not had good management of the use of state farm land. When formulating plans for developing state farm production, the ministry did not stipulate the use of large areas of state farm land to expand the production of grains, industrial raw material crops, potatoes, and vegetables, and to develop animal husbandry more rapidly. The most serious mistake of the Soviet Ministry of State Farms is that it tolerated a large reduction in the proportion of grain sown acreage in some state farms, which is obviously extremely contrary to the interests of the country.

The Party has formulated a detailed plan to improve the work of state farms. The task put forward to state farms is to increase the grain sold to the state to at least 500 million poods in the next two to three years, while also greatly increasing the amount of meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products sold to the state. All staff members of state farms should strive to complete this task.

The complexity and extreme importance of the tasks put forward by the Party and the government to agriculture require that Party and Soviet organs must conduct more skilled and in-depth leadership over all sectors of agricultural production.

Harmful, bureaucratic, and red tape methods of leading agriculture must be eliminated. The reorganization of Party district committees in rural areas must be completed in the shortest possible time, and the work of Party district committee secretaries and other staff members of the district committee should be organized according to the areas of activity of machine tractor stations so as to eliminate the phenomena of irresponsibility and lack of accountability in the leadership work of machine tractor stations and collective farms, not just formally, but actually. Political work in rural areas must be resolutely strengthened. The organizational work of Party and Soviet organs should further consolidate collective farms organizationally and economically. The collective farm system is an advanced social system. Collective farms have unlimited potential to increase agricultural production. Efforts must be made to raise all collective farms without exception to the level of advanced farms. Various measures should be taken to resolutely strengthen labor discipline in collective farms, improve labor organization, insist on adopting advanced production quotas that can continuously improve the labor productivity of collective farms in agricultural work, and rationally use the land allocated to collective farms so as to obtain more agricultural products from each hectare of land. Collective farms must be filled with experienced cadres, and the best staff members must be selected from Party and Soviet activists and agricultural experts to serve as chairmen of collective farms.

The resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee and the recently held plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee are a combat program for further accelerating the development of the entire agriculture. At present, the most important task for Party organizations is to expound the resolutions passed by the Party and mobilize the working people in urban and rural areas to successfully implement these resolutions.

The resolution states: "The plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee calls on all Communist Party members and Youth League members in rural areas, all collective farmers, and all staff members of machine tractor stations and state farms to widely launch a socialist competition, strive to vigorously increase grain production, strive for a bumper harvest of all crops, and strive to further increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of livestock products."

This warm call of the Party has penetrated the hearts of every Soviet person. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are realizing this program of vigorously developing socialist agricultural productive forces.

    全体人民的最迫切的任务
    ——苏联“真理报”三月七日社论
    昨天“真理报”刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会日前举行全体会议的公告和全会在听取了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告后，所作的“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”。
    苏共中央全会“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”，将在我国人民争取建成共产主义社会的斗争历史中占有极重要的地位。
    半年来，党和政府制定了并成功地实现着关于急剧提高农业的一系列的措施。苏共中央九月全会的决议及政府和苏共中央随后所通过的各项决定，提出了发展公共饲畜业、扩大马铃薯和蔬菜的生产、改进机器拖拉机站的工作、提高它们在集体农庄生产中的作用以及加强党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关对农业的领导的详尽纲领。
    目前党正在用进一步发展构成整个农业生产基础的谷物经济的具体战斗纲领，来武装集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。
    苏共中央九月全会提出了在当前条件下全民最迫切的任务：在社会主义重工业强大发展的基础上，在今后两、三年内充分满足我国人民对日用品日益增长的要求，并保证以原料供应轻工业和食品工业。
    党和苏维埃机关遵循着全会的决议，业已在过去一段时间内进行了巨大的工作，为完成大力提高农业一切部门的任务创造必要条件。集体农民，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员已经比前几年更好地完成了秋季田间工作。
    党和政府所采取的提高集体农庄和集体农民在发展农业生产中的物质利益的措施，大大地增加了农民的收入。过去一年集体农庄和集体农民的收入就增加了一百三十多亿卢布。
    党在实现苏共中央九月全会决议的斗争中，非常注意干部，特别是对农业起决定性作用的机器拖拉机站的干部。在苏共中央九月全会之后，列入机器拖拉机站固定人员编制的有一百二十五万名左右的拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队队长、操纵复杂农业机器的机械师及其他工作人员。近几月来，已经派遣了十万多名农艺师和饲畜师到机器拖拉机站去为集体农庄服务。从工业和国民经济其它部门抽调了两万三千名工程师和技师到机器拖拉机站工作。
    目前正在顺利地实现着加强机器拖拉机站物质生产基础的计划。
    伟大的列宁曾理想在我国有十万部拖拉机的日子。而现在我国已经有上百万部的拖拉机了。这表现出了社会主义工业，首先是重工业的伟大力量，重工业过去是、现在仍然是我国和平经济繁荣的基础，是我国国防力量的基础。
    苏共中央全会举出了业已完成的工作，同时也指出了党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关在实现中央九月全会决议及党和政府随后通过的关于农业问题的各项决议的实际工作中所存在的严重缺点。许多州到现在为止，还没有把机器拖拉机站的工人配备齐全，没有正确地分配专家干部，以致许多落后的、经济力量薄弱的集体农庄到现在还没有专家。只有少数党组织开始委派了有经验、熟悉业务、善于把集体农民群众引向公有经济高涨的道路的农庄主席来加强集体农庄。
    苏共中央全会指出：机器制造工业部负责人和许多工厂厂长对农业机器的生产任务完成得不能令人满意，他们对这个问题不是采取从国家利益出发的态度。
    到现在为止，党组织还没有消除在农业领导中无人负责的现象。
    苏共中央九月全会后这六个月是一段很短的时期。然而在这段短短的期间，苏联人民在共产党领导下已经做了巨大的工作。目前的任务就是要依靠既得成就，在扩大农业生产，首先是发展谷物生产方面进行一个巨大的跃进。党号召全体苏联人民来协力完成这项任务。
    苏共中央全会“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”，规定了在谷物生产这一社会主义农业最主要部门的任务并指出了取得胜利的途径。
    全会的决议写道：“为了完成党和政府所提出的、急速提高全国日用品生产的全民任务，进一步发展作为整个农业生产的基础的谷物，就具有特别重要的意义。”
    农业其他一切部门的进一步高涨，满足居民和全部国民经济日益增长的需要，都取决于谷物经济发展的成就。
    同时，正如苏共中央全会的决议所指出，现有的谷物生产水平，无论就其收获总量或商品量来说，都不能满足国民经济日益增长的需要。国家所掌握的谷物数量和谷物需要量不相适应。
    苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部在拟订播种面积的计划，特别是在拟订谷物和牧草的播种面积计划方面所犯的严重错误，是造成谷物生产的发展水平与居民及国民经济对粮食的日益增长的需要不相适应的基本原因之一。由于呆板地实行牧草作物轮种制，而不考虑国内各地区的特点，因而使乌克兰、北高加索区、伏尔加河流域和中央黑土地带的谷物的播种面积减少了。
    社会主义农业和全国所面临的一个头等重要任务就是要急剧扩大谷物生产，以便在最近几年内，使国家在谷物征购和收购方面能掌握较一九五三年多百分之三十五到四十的谷物。
    苏共中央全会的决议指出了完成这一任务的途径。在扩大谷物生产方面，除了提高谷物的收获量这一农业的主要任务以外，开垦新土地也具有重大的意义。在短时期内，在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索部分地区，用开垦熟荒地和生荒地的方法来扩大谷物的播种面积，是增大谷物生产的重要的和完全现实的源泉。
    党所提出的最重要的国家任务就是要在一九五四—一九五五年，靠开垦熟荒地和生荒地至少把谷物的播种面积扩展一千三百万公顷。在一九五五年，从这些耕地上应当获得十一亿至十二亿普特的谷物，其中包括八亿到九亿普特的商品谷物。
    国家为开垦土地拨出了头等的机器设备。现在，主要的问题是人、是干部。各级党、苏维埃、工会和青年团组织的职责，就是要在广泛的解释工作的基础上，在今年，向各个开垦新土地的国营农场和机器拖拉机站，选拔和派遣有经验的领导者、专家和熟练的工人。苏共中央全会批准了青年团组织关于按照自愿方式，从青年团员和青年中抽调十万名机械师参加开垦生荒地和熟荒地的倡议。
    苏共中央全会揭发了在制订农业计划和分配农作物播种面积的计划中的严重缺点。苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部在拟订农业计划时执行了错误的路线。这就是在乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国南部和摩尔达维亚苏维埃社会主义共和国的干旱和半干旱地区，在北高加索和我国东南部地区，毫无根据地扩大收获量很低的多年生牧草的播种面积，同时并大量减少谷物，特别是玉蜀黍、豆类、制米作物和谷物饲料作物的播种面积。
    必须坚决消除这些错误并改变耕地面积的分配，以便使南部和东南部地区，从一九五四年起减少对收获量低的多年生牧草的播种和耕作面积，急剧扩大谷物、特别是制米作物、豆类和谷类饲料作物的播种数量。
    苏共中央全会的决议，除制订了增加谷物生产的一些措施以外，还制定了增大工业原料作物的生产、发展果园业和葡萄种植业、巩固饲畜业的饲料基地的各种办法。
    在实现农业所面临的各种重大任务中，国营农场起着重要的作用。它们拥有一切可能使自己成为示范的和有高度赢利的农场。但是很多国营农场没有良好地使用自己的土地，供应国家的谷物、肉类、牛奶、羊毛和其它产品很少。
    许多国营农场处于落后状态和国营农场的生产、特别是谷物生产的无人照管，是苏联国营农场部领导得不好、它对采用先进经验抱着漠不关心的态度的结果。苏联国营农场部对国营农场土地的使用没有良好的管理。该部在制定发展国营农场生产的计划时，没有规定利用国营农场的大片土地来扩展谷类、工业原料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜的生产，以及更迅速地发展饲畜业。苏联国营农场部最严重的错误是，它竟容忍一些国营农场大量减少谷物播种面积的比重，而这显然是极端违背国家利益的。
    党制定了改进国营农场工作的详尽计划。向国营农场提出的任务是，在最近两、三年内要把交售给国家的谷物至少提高到五亿普特，同时并要大大地增加交售给国家的肉类、牛奶、羊毛和其它农产品的数量。国营农场所有的工作人员都应努力完成这个任务。
    党和政府向农业所提出的任务的复杂性和极端重要性，要求党的和苏维埃的机关必须对农业生产的一切部门进行更加熟练和深入的领导。
    必须消灭对农业的那种有害的、官僚主义和文牍主义的领导方法。必须在最短的时期内完成农村党的区委会的改组工作，并按照机器拖拉机站的活动区域来组织党的区委书记和区委会其他工作人员的工作，以便不再是形式地、而是实际地消除对机器拖拉机站和集体农庄领导工作中的无人负责和不负责任的现象。必须坚决加强农村政治工作。党和苏维埃机关的组织工作应当从组织上和经济上进一步巩固集体农庄。集体农庄制度是一种先进的社会制度。集体农庄拥有提高农业生产的无限潜在力。必须努力把所有的集体农庄无例外地都提高到先进农庄的水平。应当采取各种措施来坚决地加强集体农庄的劳动纪律，改进劳动组织，在农业工作中坚持采用能够不断提高集体农庄劳动生产率的先进生产定额，合理地使用分配给集体农庄的土地，以便从每一公顷的土地上得到更多的农产品。必须用有经验的干部来充实集体农庄，从党和苏维埃积极分子中选拔最优秀的工作人员，选拔农业专家充任集体农庄主席。
    苏共中央九月全会和日前举行的苏共中央全会的决议，是进一步加速整个农业发展的战斗纲领。目前对党组织说来，最重要的任务莫过于阐述党所通过的决议，并动员城乡劳动人民来顺利实现这些决议。
    决议中说：“苏共中央全体会议号召农村中的全体共产党员和青年团员，全体集体农民和机器拖拉机站及国营农场的工作人员，广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，争取大力提高谷物生产，争取全部农作物丰收，争取进一步增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜产品的生产率。”
    党的这个热烈的号召已经深入到每个苏联人的心中。苏联人民在共产党领导下正在实现着这个大力发展社会主义农业生产力的纲领。
