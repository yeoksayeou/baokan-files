Comrades!

First of all, let me express my heartfelt thanks to you and all the other voters in the Moscow City Electoral District for trusting me and giving me the high honor of nominating me as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

I consider it an honor to be your representative, and I assure you and all my other voters that I will strive not to betray your trust in me.

Comrades! Our current election campaign, like those in previous years, is being conducted under the sign of the unbreakable unity among the multi-ethnic people of the Soviet Union. This unity demonstrates the strength and vitality of the Soviet system established in our country by the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Four years have passed since the last election. Looking back at the path we have traveled during this period, we can see that the lives of the Soviet people have improved year by year. Now, thanks to the well-known resolutions passed by the Communist Party and the government to rapidly develop agriculture and consumer goods production, this improvement will proceed even more rapidly.

This is because the main purpose of the activities of our Communist Party is to work for the benefit of the Soviet people and to raise their material and cultural standards.

In its message to the voters on the eve of the last election, the Central Committee of our Communist Party stated that the Party would devote all its energies to further improving the living standards of the Soviet people and strengthening the power of the Soviet Union. Fulfilling these tasks has been the main goal of our Party and the Soviet government over the past four years.

What achievements have we made?

After the end of the war, the main attention of our Party and government was focused on the development of heavy industry. This was necessary because we had to create conditions for the smooth and rapid development of all other sectors of the national economy. Despite the enormous destruction caused by the war and the loss of manpower, our heavy industry has long surpassed pre-war levels and possesses powerful and modern technical equipment. Heavy industry is now capable of manufacturing the most complex and efficient machines and equipment, high-grade steel and alloys, and any modern weapons.

Comrades! These are very great achievements. It should be remembered that in the thirteen years since 1940, we spent four years fighting a war of unprecedented scale, and almost as much time recovering our war-torn national economy.

Heavy industry is the leading force in our national economy, creating conditions for the development of all sectors of the national economy and ensuring the strengthening of our armed forces.

If we had not produced the necessary quantities of pig iron, steel, non-ferrous metals, the latest machine tools and equipment, coal, oil and electricity, our heroic Soviet Army and Navy would not have been equipped with tanks, artillery, automobiles, warships and other weapons during the Great Patriotic War, and they would not have even better equipment today.

The development of our heavy industry has promoted the entire economic life and the entire national economy of our country, including light industry, and especially agriculture. All this has contributed to the improvement of the cultural level of the Soviet people. In industry, skilled workers and technicians have emerged, and in agriculture, tractor drivers, combine operators and other specialists have emerged. Our country has many engineers and scientists in all fields.

Thus, on the basis of socialist industrialization, we have completed a revolution in the economy. As a result, our country has become an advanced and great country in all aspects.

All these achievements were made after we completed the pre-war Five-Year Plans under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party headed by J.V. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's immortal cause.

Due to the progress made in the development of heavy industry, the Party and the government were able to raise the issue of rapidly increasing the production of manufactured goods and food.

This is not just a matter of generally increasing the output of daily necessities year by year, as has been the case until now. The task now is to greatly increase the quantity of high-quality manufactured goods and food, beautiful textiles, footwear, clothing, furniture, meat, butter, etc. supplied to the people in the next two to three years.

It would be wrong to think that concern for the welfare of the working people only began when these resolutions were passed. Before that, a lot of work had already been done in this area. For example, the development of retail trade proves this point. Because the Soviet people are buying more goods than before, their incomes have increased, stores are more well-stocked, and prices have been lowered, these are all facts. Since the abolition of the rationing system in 1947, state retail prices for daily necessities have been reduced every year, which has brought very practical benefits to all Soviet people.

What conclusions can be drawn from all this? The conclusion is this: the promise made by our Communist Party to improve the living standards of the people has been fulfilled in practice. Life has truly improved and is still improving. Our Party will continue to implement plans to improve the welfare of the working people with the same determination and perseverance.

At the same time, comrades, we cannot fail to mention the fact that we still have many needs, especially material needs, and not all of these needs can be fully met at present. For example, although we have built residential buildings with a total construction area of more than 183 million square meters for workers and employees in cities and industrial areas, and more than 4 million houses for collective farmers and rural intellectuals in rural areas since the end of the war, the housing problem remains the most acute problem. There are basically two reasons for this: the war caused too much damage to housing, and the urban population increased rapidly.

Moscow's housing has doubled since before the revolution. Many new houses are completed every year. But Moscow's housing needs are still very large. We have a ten-year general plan for the reconstruction of Moscow (1951-1960) approved by the government. According to this plan, residential buildings with a construction area of 10 million square meters will be built in Moscow, which is almost equal to the total housing in Moscow before the revolution. Moscow's Party organizations and Soviet organizations must do a lot of work to fully implement this plan and solve the housing problem in our capital.

Comrades, recently, the Party and the government have paid great attention to the further development of agriculture. It is impossible to implement our plan to improve the people's livelihood without further developing agriculture and increasing agricultural production.

Last September, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party formulated a plan to further develop animal husbandry, further increase the production of potatoes and vegetables, and improve the work of machine tractor stations (the role of machine tractor stations in developing collective farm production is now particularly enhanced).

In order to implement the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, attention was mainly focused on the issue of cadres, especially the cadres of machine tractor stations. More than 100,000 agronomists and animal breeders have been sent to machine tractor stations to serve collective farms. 23,000 engineers and technicians from industry and other sectors of the national economy have gone to work at machine tractor stations. Machine tractor stations have also received a large number of new equipment, such as tractors, grain harvesting combines, tractor-drawn seeders and other first-class agricultural machines. Machine tractor stations now have more than one million tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower).

The resolution of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party on further expanding grain production in the Soviet Union and reclaiming virgin and abandoned land is a new and extremely important contribution to the plan for further vigorously developing agriculture.

At the plenary session, staff from local Party, Soviet, agricultural and purchasing organs, chairmen of collective farms and staff from state farms participated in the discussion on this issue.

The resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party pointed out the great importance of grain cultivation to the country, and stipulated as an important national task to greatly increase the output of wheat and other grains by reclaiming virgin and abandoned land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River basin and the North Caucasus, and to expand the grain sown area by at least 13 million hectares in 1954-1955, so that these lands can be used to increase grain production by more than 1 billion poods in 1955.

Comrades, this is a difficult task, but it is completely practical and within our capabilities.

In order to reclaim virgin and abandoned land, the state will supply 120,000 tractors, 10,000 combines and many other equipment this year. Many experts and skilled workers have already set off for the reclamation areas, and many more will go there. Our glorious Communist Youth League has decided to send 100,000 agricultural machine operators from members of the Youth League and youth to reclaim the land.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Party also adopted many other resolutions on agriculture. The purpose of these resolutions is to produce abundant agricultural products in our country.

The struggle for the rapid development of agriculture is one of the most important tasks of communist construction at present. Comrades, this is a national, all-people's task. Not only rural areas participate in completing this task, but also cities. The Soviet people have responded to the call of the Party and the government in the past, solved the problems they encountered more than once and achieved their goals. This time, there is no doubt that it will be the same in the matter of further developing agriculture. This task will also be completed.

The overall result of the development of our socialist economy shows that it is constantly advancing, which creates favorable conditions for the cultural development of the Soviet people. The Soviet system has aroused a strong demand for education and culture among the broad masses of the people, unprecedented in human history. In our country, the number of people receiving secondary and higher education is increasing year by year. Literature, art and science have made great progress in our country.

Without the great progress of the people in culture, without their all-round development in wisdom and body, it is unimaginable to transition from socialism to communism. Therefore, the Party and the government will continue to care for the development of Soviet science and culture, and the improvement of the cultural level of the Soviet people in the future.

Comrades, if we work harder and if we make full use of our potential, we can achieve even greater achievements in the socialist economy.

Take industry as an example. There are still many big shortcomings in this sector of the national economy, and we cannot close our eyes to this fact and pretend not to see it. On the one hand, there are many well-managed factories, but unfortunately there are also quite a few factories that have not completed the tasks stipulated by the state plan. Many factories have not yet fully adopted the advanced experience of innovation workers. Not all existing equipment has been fully utilized everywhere. Not all enterprises have completed the task of reducing production costs. As for Moscow's industry, the overall performance is not bad, but these shortcomings also exist in many factories in Moscow.

In our industry, as in our agriculture, there are still many reserves and untapped potentials that we have not yet touched, or to put it more simply, are often placed before our eyes. If the backward factories, collective farms, state farms and machine tractor stations are raised to the advanced level, if all their reserves are fully utilized, you can imagine what a powerful new source of increased production we can get!

The current huge tasks of our national economy require us to make more determined efforts to further improve labor productivity. Therefore, we must expand socialist competition more widely. We must be bolder and more ruthless in criticizing the shortcomings in our work, and strive to eliminate these shortcomings as quickly as possible.

One of the main conditions for guaranteeing the victorious completion of the tasks set by the Party and the government is to resolutely eliminate the bureaucratic leadership method of being high above, which is that leaders and those being led are buried in a pile of documents, unable to see the living problems and living people behind the documents. The Party is taking resolute measures to eliminate this erroneous leadership method, and there is no doubt that it will be successful in this important issue.

Comrades, in the period since the last election to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the international position of the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp has been further consolidated.

The governments of the socialist and democratic camp countries, in accordance with the will of their people, have consistently and resolutely waged a resolute struggle to ease international tensions, to establish normal relations between countries, and to maintain and safeguard peace.

The peaceful nature of Soviet foreign policy was once again very vividly demonstrated at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference. This conference helped to clarify some issues and showed that the measures taken by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions are producing results.

An agreement was reached in Berlin to hold a meeting of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and China—in April this year. In this way, the People's Republic of China will be placed alongside other major powers and gain its legitimate position.

The powerful international force that China now represents cannot be ignored or disregarded. The People's Republic of China has only been established for about four and a half years. During this period, the People's China has not only healed the wounds caused by war and intervention, but has also implemented huge democratic reforms, promoted its economy, and begun planned economic development. Today, the People's Republic of China, linked by unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union, has become a truly great power and a strong bastion of peace and security in the Far East.

All the people's democratic countries have also made great achievements on their path of development. The governments of these countries are now focusing their efforts on further improving the welfare of the working people and raising their living standards.

The entire socialist and democratic camp has become stronger and more united in recent years. The economic and political ties between the countries in this camp have become stronger. Let us wish our friends in Europe and Asia continued success in building a new life and improving their living standards. May the fraternal friendship between the people's democratic countries be further consolidated!

On the eve of the last election to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, our Party said that it would work tirelessly to strive for international cooperation and to strengthen the front of peace, democracy and socialism. Now we see that the Party has fulfilled this promise.

In the future, the Communist Party and the Soviet government will, as stated in the message of the Central Committee of the Party to all voters, "do everything possible to stop a new war, to enable the people of all countries to live in peace, to ease international tensions, and to establish normal international relations."

This is the basis and essence of our foreign policy.

Comrades, since the last election to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, all the main forces that form the foundation of the strength of our Soviet socialist country have grown stronger.

Soviet society, this great working family united by the unity of the economic and political interests of its members, is more closely united than before. In the war, the unity of Soviet society was most vividly manifested in the unwavering determination to defeat the enemy, and now, this unity is most vividly manifested in the work of completing communist construction and the struggle to defend peace.

One of the main pillars of our country's strength, the alliance of the working class and the collective peasantry, has been further consolidated.

The friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union has also been further consolidated, which is also the source of the strength of the socialist country.

A vivid manifestation of the friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is the celebration this year of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. This festival of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples is also a festival of all other nationalities in the Soviet Union.

The patriotism of the Soviet people has become stronger and deeper. The Soviet people, seeing and feeling the continuous growth of the strength of our socialist motherland and the expansion of its influence in international affairs, are rightly proud of its achievements and are stepping up preparations to defend it.

Comrades, in the past four years, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have taken and are still taking measures to improve our country's defense capabilities and strengthen our armed forces, because the imperialists are constantly increasing their armed forces.

If we do not strengthen our armed forces, then we are bound to make an irreparable mistake. There are too many facts and examples that show that the imperialist forces, headed by the United States, are openly pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war against us and the people's democratic countries. The accelerated arms expansion of the US-British bloc countries, the construction of military bases in Europe and other territories, and the policy of reviving German militarism—all this clearly shows what the imperialists are pursuing and in what direction they are heading.

In this situation, we have no right to waste time, and we must not be complacent and deceive ourselves, thinking that we have already won victory in the war, and that we have the most powerful army in the world. Everyone knows that if you don't move forward, you will fall behind, and if you fall behind, you will be beaten.

Therefore, after we won victory in the Great Patriotic War, our Party and government did not relax their efforts to consolidate our national defense. In recent years, thanks to various efforts, the Soviet Army and Navy have mastered the combat experience of the Great Patriotic War, and have learned to master the latest military equipment fully supplied under the care of the Party and the government. Therefore, they have made great progress in organizational, strategic and tactical preparation, and in improving their combat effectiveness.

The main thing in the military field is the continuous improvement of the armed forces. And this is especially true in the air force, where technological progress is particularly rapid. In these years, we have strived to develop our aviation technology, striving not to lag behind modern requirements. And we have done a lot of work in this area. Now, our air force has the latest high-speed jet aircraft. In this regard, we have taken all necessary measures for the army as well. The Party and the government also constantly care about strengthening our navy on the basis of the latest naval technology. Our brave navy, together with the Soviet Army, jointly and reliably defends our country's coastal defense.

The technical equipment of our armed forces is increasing year by year. But everyone knows very well that even the most modern weapons cannot guarantee victory in battle if the people who use the weapons do not master the method of using them and cannot use their full potential. In this regard, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with our personnel. Our armed forces have experienced officers and generals who are infinitely loyal to the motherland and are capable of educating and training the army according to modern requirements. At present, the engineering and technical training of officers and soldiers is being vigorously carried out in our armed forces. Since the army and navy now get young people from industry and agriculture who have the technical knowledge and practical experience to operate various machines and machinery, this task is much easier to carry out.

As I have already said, the main task of our army and navy remains to tirelessly and meticulously improve the operational readiness of all services. The constant operational readiness of our army and navy is the most reliable guarantee against any eventuality.

We cannot think that the imperialists are spending a lot of material resources and large sums of money to expand their armaments just to scare us.

We cannot believe in the compassion of the imperialists, and reality has proven that they will not hesitate to use any weapons of mass destruction.

We must always be prepared to give any enemy who possesses any weapon a head-on blow.

After the death of J.V. Stalin, some people in the international reactionary group began to harbor hopes and various plans, thinking that various entanglements would inevitably occur within the Soviet Union.

Only those who have a wrong understanding of the actual situation in the Soviet Union and do not take into account that the entire activities of our Party and government are guided by the immortal theory of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin—a theory that clarifies our goals and directions—would think this way.

Our strength lies in the collective wisdom of the Party and the government. The current leadership of our country, composed of loyal comrades and students of Lenin and Stalin, is united, united, coordinated, strong, and able to guarantee the continuous prosperity of our socialist motherland in practice.

As for our Soviet people, they have become more closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government in the past year, and under their leadership, are advancing along the road pointed out by the great Lenin, the road to communism.

Long live our great socialist motherland!

Long live our heroic Soviet people and their government!

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which leads our people to communism with full confidence!

(N.A. Bulganin's speech was constantly interrupted by stormy applause.)

### 在莫斯科市选区的选民大会上  尼  ·亚·布尔加宁同志的演说

专栏：

    在莫斯科市选区的选民大会上
    尼  ·亚·布尔加宁同志的演说同志们！
    首先让我衷心地感谢你们以及莫斯科市选区的其他一切选民，感谢你们信任我，给我以崇高的荣誉，提名我为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人。
    我认为做你们的代表是光荣的，我向你们以及我的所有其他选民保证，我将努力不辜负你们对我的信任。
    同志们！我们这一届选举运动和前几年一样，是在多民族的苏联人民之间牢不可破的团结的标志下进行的。这种团结说明了伟大的十月社会主义革命在我国建立起来的苏维埃制度的力量和生命力。
    自从上届选举以来已经有四年了。回顾我们在这个时期内所经历的道路，我们可以看到苏联人民的生活一年比一年改善了。现在，由于共产党和政府通过了众所周知的迅速发展农业和日用品生产的决议，这种改善将更加迅速地进行。
    其所以如此，是因为我们共产党的活动的主要目的在于为苏联人民的利益而工作，在于提高他们的物质和文化水平。
    我们共产党中央委员会在上届选举的前夕发表的告选民书中说，党将以全部精力来进一步提高苏联人民的生活水平，加强苏联人民的力量。完成这些任务是我们的党和苏联政府在过去四年中的主要目标。
    我们取得了什么成就了呢？
    战争结束以后，我们的党和政府的主要注意力放在重工业的发展方面。这是必要的，因为我们必须为顺利地、迅速地发展国民经济的其他一切部门创造条件。尽管战争造成了巨大的破坏和人力的损失，我们的重工业早就超过了战前的水平，而且拥有强大的、最新式的技术设备。重工业现在能够制造最复杂的、效率最高的机器和设备，高级的钢和合金，以及任何现代化的武器。
    同志们！这些都是非常大的成就。应该记住，自一九四○年以来的十三年中，有四年我们进行了一个规模空前的战争，又花了几乎同样多的时间来恢复我们的饱受战争破坏的国民经济。
    重工业是我们国民经济的领导力量，它为一切国民经济部门的发展创造着条件，并保证我们武装部队的力量的加强。
    假如我们没有生产必要数量的铣铁、钢铁、有色金属、最新式的工作母机和设备、煤、石油和电力的话，我们英勇的苏联陆海军在伟大的卫国战争中就不会配备有坦克、大炮、汽车、军舰和其他武器，今天他们也不会有更精良的配备了。
    我们的重工业的发展推进了我国整个经济生活和整个国民经济，包括轻工业，特别是农业在内。所有这一切都促进了苏联人民文化水平的提高。在工业方面，出现了熟练的工人和技术人员，在农业方面，出现了拖拉机手、联合机手及其他专家。我们的国家在各方面都有了许多工程师和科学家。
    这样，在社会主义工业化的基础上，我们在经济中完成了一次革命。结果，我们的国家在各方面都成了一个先进的、伟大的国家。
    所有这些成就都是我们在以列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林为首的共产党中央委员会的领导下，完成了战前五年计划以后取得的。
    由于在发展重工业方面取得的进展，党和政府才能够提出迅速增加制成品和食品生产的问题。
    这不仅是一个一般地逐年增加日用品产量的问题，像直到现在为止的情形一样。现在的任务是，要在今后两三年内大大增加供应给人民的高等制成品和食品、漂亮的纺织品、鞋类、服装、家具、肉类、奶油等的数量。
    如果认为只是从通过这些决议的时候起才开始关心劳动人民的福利的话，那就错了。在此以前，在这方面已经做了很多工作。譬如，零售贸易的发展就证明了这一点。因为苏联人民买进的货物比以前增多了，他们的收入增加了，商店里的存货更充足了，价格也减低了，这些都是事实。自从一九四七年废除配给制以来，日用品的国家零售价格每年都在减低，这给全体苏联人民带来了非常实际的好处。
    从所有这些能得出什么结论呢？结论是这样的：我们共产党提出的提高人民生活水平的诺言已经在实际上履行了。生活已经真正得到改善而且还在改善中。我们的党将同样坚决地、坚持不渝地继续实行增进劳动人民福利的计划。
    同时，同志们，我们也不能不谈到这个事实，就是我们仍然有许多种需要，特别是物质需要，而现在并不是所有这些需要都能得到充分满足的。譬如，尽管自战争结束以来，我们已经为城市和工业区的工人和职工建造了建筑面积达一亿八千三百多万平方公尺的住宅，为农村的集体农民和农村知识分子建筑了四百多万幢住宅，但是房屋问题仍然是最尖锐的问题。这基本上有两个原因：战时房屋破坏太大，城市人口迅速增加。
    莫斯科的住宅已比革命前增加了一倍。每年有许多新住宅落成。但是莫斯科的住宅需要仍然很大。我们有了一个政府所通过的莫斯科改建十年总计划（一九五一—一九六○年）。根据这个计划，将在莫斯科建造建筑面积达一千万平方公尺的住宅，差不多等于革命前莫斯科市的全部住宅。莫斯科的党组织和苏维埃组织必须做许多工作来充分实现这个计划，解决我们首都的住宅问题。
    同志们，最近期间，党和政府对于进一步发展农业一直予以极大的注意。如果不进一步发展农业，不增加农业生产量，就不可能实行我们制订的改善人民生活的计划。
    去年九月党中央委员会全体会议制订了一项进一步发展饲畜业、进一步增加马铃薯和蔬菜产量以及改进机器拖拉机站（机器拖拉机站在发展集体农庄生产方面的作用现在特别增大了）工作的计划。
    为了执行党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议，注意力主要集中在干部问题上，特别是机器拖拉机站的干部问题上。已有十万多个农艺师和动物饲养人员被派往机器拖拉机站去为集体农庄服务。工业和国民经济其他部门的二万三千个工程师和技术人员已到机器拖拉机站去工作。机器拖拉机站还得到了大量的新设备，如拖拉机、谷物收割联合机、拖拉机牵引播种机和其他头等农业机器。机器拖拉机站现在有一百多万部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）。
    党中央委员会最近一次全体会议关于进一步扩展苏联谷物生产及开垦处女地和荒废的土地的决议，对于进一步大力发展农业的计划是一个新的极其重要的贡献。
    在全体会议上，地方的党、苏维埃、农业和征购机关的工作人员，集体农庄主席和国营农场工作人员都参加了关于这个问题的讨论。
    党中央委员会全体会议的决议指出了谷物种植对国家的巨大重要性，并作为一项重要的国家任务规定大大提高小麦和其他谷物的产量，办法是开垦哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域以及北高加索的处女地和荒废的土地，在一九五四—一九五五年至少扩大谷物播种面积一千三百万公顷，以便在一九五五年可以利用这些土地增产十亿普特以上的谷物。
    同志们，这是一个艰巨的任务，但是是完全切实可行并且是我们的能力可以办得到的。
    为了开垦处女地和荒废的土地，国家今年将供应十二万部拖拉机、一万部联合机和其他许多的设备。许多专家和熟练工人已经动身前往开垦地区，还有许多人将要到那里去。我们的光荣的共产主义青年团已决定从青年团员和青年中派出十万名农业机器操使者前去开垦。
    党中央委员会全体会议还通过了其他许多关于农业的决议。这些决议的目的都是为了要在我国生产丰富的农产品。
    为迅速发展农业而斗争是目前共产主义建设的最重要的工作之一。同志们，这是全国的、全体人民的任务。参加完成这一任务的不仅有农村，而且有城市。苏联人民过去响应党和政府的号召，不止一次地解决了他们所遇到的问题并达到了目的。这一次，在进一步发展农业问题上无疑地也会是这样的。这个任务也会完成的。
    我国社会主义经济发展的总结果，说明它是不断前进的，这为苏维埃人的文化发展创造了有利的条件。苏维埃制度唤起了广大人民的、在人类历史上没有先例的、对于教育和文化的热烈要求。在我们的国家中，受中等和高等教育的人数一年比一年增多。文学、艺术和科学在我国有了很大的进展。
    如果没有人民在文化上的巨大进步，如果没有他们在智慧和身体上的全面发展，要从社会主义过渡到共产主义是不可想象的。因此，党和政府在今后仍将继续关怀苏维埃科学和文化的发展，以及苏联人民文化水平的提高。
    同志们，假如我们更加努力，假如我们充分利用我们的潜在能力的话，我们在社会主义经济中还能获得更大的成就。
    以工业为例。在国民经济的这个部门中仍然存在着许多很大的缺点，对于这个事实我们不能闭起眼睛，装作不看见。一方面有许多管理得很好的工厂，但是不幸同时有不少的工厂没有完成国家计划所规定的任务。许多工厂还没有充分采用革新工作者的先进经验。并不是现有的设备在所有的地方都已经得到充分的利用的。并不是所有的企业都完成了降低生产成本的任务的。至于莫斯科的工业，整个说来成绩还不坏，但是莫斯科的许多工厂中也存在着这些缺点。
    在我们的工业中像在我们的农业中一样，仍然有许多后备力量和未利用的潜力至今还没有被我们接触到，或者说得通俗一些，还常常摆在我们的眼前。假如把落后的工厂、集体农庄、国营农场以及机器拖拉机站提高到先进的水平，假如它们所有的后备力量得到充分利用的话，你们就能想像到，我们能够得到一个多么强大的、增加生产的新泉源！
    我国国民经济当前的巨大任务，要求我们更坚决地努力来进一步提高劳动生产率。因此，必须更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛。我们必须更大胆地，更不留情地批评工作中存在的缺点，并为最迅速地消灭这些缺点而努力。
    保证胜利完成党和政府所规定的任务的主要条件之一，就是坚决消除高高在上的官僚主义领导方法，这种方法就是，领导和被领导者都埋头在一大堆文件中，看不见文件后面的活的问题与活的人。党正采取坚决的措施来消灭这种错误的领导方法，无疑的，在这个重要问题上会得到成功的。
    同志们，自上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以来的这段时期中，苏联以及整个民主阵营的国际地位已经进一步巩固了。
    社会主义和民主阵营各国政府根据它们人民的意志，到现在为止一直在坚持不渝地进行坚决的斗争，以争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取各国之间建立正常的关系，并维持和保障和平。
    苏联外交政策的和平性质最近在柏林外长会议上再一次得到了非常生动的证明。这次会议有助于澄清一些问题，并说明苏联采取的缓和国际紧张局势的措施正在产生效果。
    在柏林达成了协议，决定在今年四月举行五大国——苏联、美国、法国、英国、中国——会议。这样，中华人民共和国将和其他大国并列，得到它合法的地位。
    不能忽视或无视中国现在所代表的强大的国际力量。中华人民共和国成立迄今只不过约四年半的时间。在这段时期内，人民中国不仅是治愈了战争和干涉所造成的创伤，而且实行了巨大的民主改革，推进了它的经济，开始了有计划的经济发展。今天，中华人民共和国以牢不可破的友谊和苏联联系着，成了一个真正的大国，成了远东和平和安全的坚强堡垒。
    所有的人民民主国家在它们的发展道路上也有了巨大的成就。这些国家的政府现在正集中力量进
  一步增进劳动人民的福利，提高他们的生活水平。
    整个社会主义和民主阵营近几年来变得更加强大、更加团结了。这个阵营各国之间的经济和政治联系更加牢固了。让我们祝我们在欧洲和亚洲的朋友们在建设新生活和提高他们的生活水平方面继续取得胜利。祝人民民主国家间的兄弟般的友谊更加巩固！
    在上届苏联最高苏维埃选举前夕，我们的党曾经说过，它要不倦地工作，来争取国际合作，争取加强和平、民主和社会主义的阵线。现在我们看到，党已经履行了这个诺言。
    在将来，共产党和苏维埃政府还要像党中央委员会告全体选民书中所说的一样，“竭尽全力制止新战争，使各国人民和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势，建立正常的国际关系。”
    这就是我们的外交政策的基础和实质。
    同志们，自从上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以后，作为我们的苏维埃社会主义国家力量的基础的一切主要力量更加成长壮大了。
    苏维埃社会，这个由于社会成员的经济和政治利益的一致性而结合起来的伟大的劳动大家庭，团结得比以前更加紧密了。在战争中，苏维埃社会的团结最生动地表现在毫不动摇的打败敌人的决心上，而现在，这种团结就最生动地表现在完成共产主义建设的工作中和保卫和平的斗争中。
    我国的强大力量的主要支柱之一，工人阶级和集体农民的联盟更加巩固了。
    苏联各族人民之间的友谊也更加巩固了，这也是社会主义国家力量的泉源。
    苏联各族人民之间的友谊的生动表现就是今年庆祝的乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。俄罗斯和乌克兰人民的这一个节日也是苏联所有其他民族人民的节日。
    苏联人民的爱国主义更加坚强、更加深刻了。苏联人民由于看到并感觉到我们社会主义祖国力量的不断增长，以及它在国际事务中的影响的扩大，理所当然地为它的成就而感到骄傲，并正加紧准备来保卫它。
    同志们，在过去四年中，共产党和苏维埃政府采取了而且现在还在采取措施来提高我们国家的防御能力，并加强我们的武装部队，因为帝国主义者正不断增加它们的武装部队。
    假如我们不加强我们的武装部队，那么我们必然就要犯下一个不可弥补的错误。有太多的事实和例子说明，以美国为首的帝国主义力量，正在公开地奉行准备对我们和各人民民主国家进行新战争的政策。美英集团国家的加紧扩充军备，在欧洲和其他领土上建筑军事基地，复活德国军国主义的政策——这一切十分清楚地说明帝国主义者所追求的是什么，他们在朝那个方向走。
    在这种情况下，我们没有权利浪费时间了，我们更不能够自满和欺骗自己，以为我们已经在战争中取得了胜利，以为我们拥有世界上最强大的军队。大家都知道，不前进就要落后，既落后就要挨打。
    因此，我们在伟大的卫国战争中获得胜利后，我们的党和政府并没有放松它们的巩固我们国防力量的努力。最近几年来，由于进行了各种工作，苏联陆海军已经掌握伟大的卫国战争中的战斗经验，而且学会掌握在党和政府的关怀下充分供应的最新式的军事设备，因此，它们已经在组织上、战略和战术准备上，以及在提高他们战斗效力上有了很大的进步。
    在军事方面的主要事情，就是武装部队的不断改进。而在技术进步得特别快的空军这一方面，情况更是如此。在这几年中，我们努力发展我们的航空技术，力求不落后于现代的要求。而且在这一方面做得很有成绩。现在，我们的空军有了最新式的高速喷气飞机。在这一方面，我们对陆军也同样采取了一切必要的措施。党和政府同样经常关心在最新的海军技术基础上加强我们的海军。我们勇敢的海军和苏联陆军一起，共同可靠地保卫着我们国家的海防。
    我们武装部队的技术装备一年比一年增加。但是大家都很知道，如果使用武器的人不掌握武器的使用方法，不能利用它们的全部潜力的话，那末即使是最新式的武器也是不能保证战斗的胜利的。在这一方面，我们没有理由不满意我们的人员。我们的武装部队有着经验丰富的、无限忠于祖国的、有能力按照现代的要求来教育和训练军队的军官和将领。目前我们的武装部队中正在大力进行官兵的工程—技术训练。由于陆海军现在从工业和农业中得到具有操使各种机器和机械的技术知识和实际经验的青年，这个任务执行起来就比较容易得多了。
    正如我已经说过的，我们的陆军和海军的主要任务仍然是不倦地、精益求精地改进各兵种的作战准备。我们陆军和海军的经常的作战准备，是应付任何意外的最可靠的保证。
    我们不能以为帝国主义者花费大量的物质资源和大笔款项来扩充军备，仅仅是为了吓吓我们。
    我们也不能相信帝国主义者的恻隐之心，现实已经证明他们是不惜使用任何大规模毁灭性武器的。
    我们必须经常准备给予拥有任何武器的任何敌人以迎头痛击。
    在约·维·斯大林逝世后，国际反动集团中有一些人开始怀抱希望和各种打算，以为苏联内部不可避免地要发生各种各样的纠葛。
    只有对苏联实际情况有错误的了解、而且不考虑到我们党和政府的整个活动是以马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的不朽学说——明确我们的目的和方向的学说——为指针的人才这样想。
    我们的力量在于党和政府的集体智慧。由列宁和斯大林的忠实战友和学生们组成的我们国家目前的领导，是统一的、团结的、协调一致的、强大的，并且是能够在实践中保证我们社会主义祖国的不断繁荣的。
    至于我们苏联人民，他们在过去一年中更加紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，并在它们的领导下沿着伟大的列宁所指出的道路、共产主义的道路前进。
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！
    我们英勇的苏联人民和他们的政府万岁！
    满怀信心地领导着我国人民走向共产主义的苏联共产党万岁！
