He said: "You are guarding the long border of the motherland day and night, and you have wiped out the US-Chiang armed special agent Osman and other bandits, defended the border of the motherland, and maintained the peaceful life of all ethnic groups. You have also resolutely implemented the task of the People's Liberation Army as both a fighting force and a working force, so that the political, economic, and cultural outlook of Xinjiang has been completely renewed. You have also diligently reclaimed more than one million mu of land, built water conservancy projects, and carried out large-scale agricultural production, turning deserts into fertile fields. You have also built many factories in Xinjiang, bringing modern industry to Xinjiang. You have resolutely implemented the Party's ethnic policies and have been wholeheartedly loved by the people of all ethnic groups." Finally, Yuan Renyuan told everyone: "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are both in good health, and they care for you as they care for their children thousands of miles away!" At this time, all the commanders and fighters present stood up and thanked Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for their deep concern with thunderous applause. Then, Yang Mingxuan said: "The various achievements of the People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang have ensured the unprecedented and truly unified unity of the great motherland."

In the future, we must strive to learn the general line of the country during the transition period and improve the socialist ideological consciousness of the troops. We must strive to improve our military, political, and cultural levels so that we can better fulfill the task of defending the border of the great motherland. Our reclamation troops must also constantly improve their various production technical levels and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that they can become construction shock troops with skilled technology on the production front. We will abide by the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, strengthen unity within the army, strengthen unity between the army and the government and the people of all ethnic groups, and strive to thoroughly realize the Party's general line during the transition period and build our country into a great socialist country!"
