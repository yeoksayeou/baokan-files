    Do a Good Job of Publicizing Advanced Agricultural Production Experience
     Ti Xin
    In agricultural propaganda in newspapers, in addition to inspiring and guiding the peasant masses to organize and implement mutual aid and cooperation, it is also necessary to promote the peasant masses to actively improve farming techniques and raise the level of agricultural technology. In raising the level of agricultural technology, promoting existing advanced experiences in agricultural production is an important link; this is one of the main methods to tap the potential of agricultural production and increase yield per unit area under current conditions. In the March 16, 1953, instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to party committees at all levels regarding spring plowing production, in addition to requiring rural party committees at all levels to correctly lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it also required them to "summarize and improve the good production experiences of the peasant masses according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions of 'from the masses, to the masses,' and then promote them." It pointed out: "In this way, the continuous development and improvement of agricultural production will be guaranteed, and our country's industrialization will be able to obtain cooperation and support from agriculture." As a powerful assistant to the Party in economic construction, newspapers, especially those in agricultural areas, should also attach great importance to the publicity of advanced agricultural production experiences and strive to do a good job in this publicity.
    In the publicity of promoting advanced experience and improving agricultural technology, some newspapers have taken detours. Some newspapers, after the land reform, did not clearly point out the development direction of the small-peasant economy and actively guide peasants to take the socialist road of mutual aid and cooperation, but only publicized the issue of improving agricultural technology in isolation, creating an impression among readers that the current task of peasants was only "to fight against nature." This was propaganda without a line, and it was impossible to launch a truly mass-based technical reform movement. A few newspapers also emphasized the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but neglected or relaxed the issue of improving agricultural technology, and did not strive to discover and disseminate the existing advanced experiences of individual regions and individual production experts. This could not effectively criticize the "production has reached its limit" thinking among peasants and oppose the general leadership style among cadres, mobilize the broad masses to fully tap production potential; and it could not promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement by promoting advanced agricultural technology. It should be recognized that the promotion of advanced agricultural production experience must be combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On the one hand, only organized peasants can better use their superior conditions of collective operation to adopt and develop advanced agricultural technology. On the other hand, the promotion of advanced agricultural technology will help organized peasants increase production and income, thereby enriching the content of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; and educate individual farmers to recognize the care of the Party and government for farmers' production, and to recognize the superiority of organization in improving agricultural technology, so as to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation. This is the logic inherent in life itself. Therefore, newspapers must be good at organically and closely combining the publicity of promoting advanced agricultural production experience with the publicity of mutual aid and cooperation. Neglecting the improvement of agricultural technology and publicizing the improvement of agricultural technology in isolation are both unrealistic.
    There is a perception that hinders newspapers from more fully publicizing advanced agricultural production experience. That is, some comrades believe that newspapers are a tool for the Party to conduct political and ideological education of the people, and it should not publicize production technology, including agricultural technology, too much. This is a one-sided view. Since improving agricultural technology is of great importance in the struggle to improve agricultural production, and since the broad masses of peasants are increasingly dissatisfied with the old and backward farming methods, agricultural propaganda in newspapers cannot but touch on the issue of agricultural technology. If newspapers evade this issue raised by the cause of economic construction, it is inevitable that they will be divorced from reality and from the masses in an important aspect. At the same time, it should also be seen that the agricultural production process is not as complex as the industrial production process, and therefore agricultural technology is not as complex and diverse as industrial technology. For example, the principle of rational close planting is not only applicable to many regions, but also applicable to many crops. As long as newspapers are good at popularizing agricultural technology, general readers and peasants can easily understand it. Therefore, newspapers, especially those in agricultural areas, have a greater responsibility for the publicity of agricultural technology than for the publicity of industrial technology.
    However, the Party's official newspapers above the provincial and municipal level are political newspapers, which are different from professional publications. They do not have to report all production technology issues, large and small, nor can they publicize advanced experience in production technology from a purely business and technical point of view, but should first and foremost focus on the economic and political significance of advanced experience for publicity. The main concern of newspapers should be the key issues in current production. It should strive to discover and promote typical experiences on these key issues, that is, decisive advanced experiences with universal significance. The reason why it is important to publicize this decisive advanced experience is because once this advanced experience is popularized to a wide range of areas and mastered by millions of peasants, the level of agricultural production can be greatly improved on the existing basis. Take the example of Zhaoyuan's (i.e., the later Horqin Right Front Banner, same below) high-yield experience. This experience not only provided an example of the mass line working method of going deep into the masses to summarize farming experience and then promoting it in agricultural production leadership, but also proposed and began to solve the key problems of increasing agricultural production in Heilongjiang Province and Northeast China, that is, implementing rational close planting to overcome the widespread phenomenon of missing seedlings, insufficient number of plants, and wasting land fertility; using this method, only by improving on the old farming basis can the yield per unit area be increased by one to two times. According to preliminary estimates, the result of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience in various parts of Northeast China last year was that the region increased grain production by about one million tons. This shows how significant the promotion of decisive advanced experience is for improving agricultural production. The Northeast Daily and the Heilongjiang Daily correctly recognized the significance of the Zhaoyuan experience, conducted large-scale publicity of this advanced experience over the course of more than a year, and organized its promotion in a planned and systematic manner. This grasped a major contradiction in the current increase in production and made a certain contribution to solving this contradiction, thereby better exerting the role of newspapers in promoting economic construction. However, not all newspapers are good at organizing the publicity of agricultural technology. Some newspapers often fail to grasp the decisive advanced experience, and over-publicize general technical issues, resulting in the shortcoming of "strong technical content but poor promotion of advanced experience."
    Different from promoting advanced experience in industrial production, the promotion of advanced agricultural production experience must firmly grasp a principle, that is, to take care of the characteristics of the current small-peasant economy, and to take care of the low cultural level of peasants and the differences in natural conditions in various places. This requires our newspapers to adhere to the working method of "from the masses, to the masses" and the principle of "taking materials locally and promoting them locally" in the publicity of advanced agricultural production experience. Newspapers should not only guide practical work with such principles, but especially embody the above principles deeply in their own publicity reports. It is not understanding life to try to promote advanced agricultural technology with a simple formula according to subjective wishes alone. When the Anhui Daily publicized Chen Yongkang's high-yield rice experience in Songjiang, Jiangsu, it did not achieve the due effect because it did not pay attention to how to specifically apply it according to the soil, climate, and seed conditions of various regions in Anhui. However, when the newspaper introduced the experience of changing dry land to paddy fields and changing to high-yield crops in Huaibei, and when it introduced the experience of full seedling and replanting, it had a great impact because it was combined with key experiments and was also local experience. This is a very good illustration. But on the other hand, it is also wrong to overemphasize the decentralization of the small-peasant economy and the regional nature of agricultural production, and not to adapt to the production conditions and mass demands at the time and in the local area, and to actively and correctly publicize and promote advanced experience that has been effective locally or elsewhere. Some newspapers, when inspecting the deviation of blind advance during spring plowing production last year, even publicized the experience of "deep plowing, fine cultivation, rational fertilization, sparse seeding and close planting" that had been summarized by the local masses. If newspapers adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards advanced agricultural production experience, they cannot but fall behind life.
    Although Chinese peasants have accumulated many good experiences in their long-term production practice, which is precisely the starting point for our current agricultural technology reform; at the same time, it should also be seen that because Chinese peasants used to produce under feudal production relations and the small-peasant economy, these experiences are not very systematic or scientific. Therefore, newspapers cannot be satisfied with merely introducing the farming methods of this or that production expert, but should strive to deeply explain their working methods and give scientific summaries to their experiences; they should use the brilliance of advanced agricultural science to illuminate the original production experience of peasants, eliminate the dross and preserve the essence. To achieve this, newspapers must strengthen their ties with agricultural science and technology workers, and especially attract them to participate in the publicity of advanced experience. After large areas of Henan Province suffered frost damage in April last year, the Henan Daily, on the one hand, promptly introduced the experience of watering wheat to protect seedlings by Li Yunsheng, an old farmer in Huiguozhen, Gong County, and on the other hand, organized agricultural experts to explain and summarize the method of watering wheat from a scientific point of view, which played a great role in enhancing the confidence of the peasant masses in overcoming natural disasters and promoting the rescue of wheat seedlings in various places. However, the publicity of advanced agricultural experience by some newspapers often makes the mistake of empiricism. The publicity of these newspapers only played the role of "notification," lacking a deep and thorough explanation of why the advanced experience itself is advanced; sometimes it even deviates from scientific principles and disseminates erroneous "experience." Combining new agricultural science and technology with the rich experience of the peasant masses in production practice, and continuously improving the technical level of agriculture in our country, this is the goal to be achieved by newspapers in the publicity of advanced agricultural experience. It is certainly wrong to mechanically apply so-called "science and technology" regardless of local production conditions and mass demands; it is equally wrong to stay at the existing production technology level of peasants without taking a step forward.
    Experience has proved that the process of promoting advanced agricultural technology is a process of new and old struggles. For the broad masses of peasants, this is first and foremost a struggle between advanced and conservative thinking; for the leadership of agricultural production, this is a struggle between the mass line work style and the general leadership work style. Only by investing in the center of this struggle can newspapers effectively guide the development of the struggle and pave the way for the popularization of new things. The reason why the Heilongjiang Daily has achieved greater results in publicizing the Zhaoyuan experience is precisely because the editorial department has gone deeper into the masses to conduct investigation and research, familiarized themselves with the actual work and the ideological situation of the masses, and mastered the law of promoting this experience. Therefore, the newspaper can specifically and vividly compare the old and new farming methods, explain the benefits of the new farming methods, and publicize scientific principles in response to the ideological concerns of the masses; it can guide the promotion work in other areas based on the experience of Zhaoyuan in promoting new farming methods; and it can combine the development of the actual movement to timely set up examples, eliminate ideological obstacles, and reveal the problems in the promotion. If newspapers do not go deep and specifically understand the main problems in the growth and promotion process of advanced experience, it is naturally difficult to effectively exert their publicity, mobilization, and organizational role. This is the reason why the publicity of advanced experience by some newspapers cannot be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and the promotion of advanced experience is weak. Naturally, the Heilongjiang Daily also had shortcomings at the beginning of the publicity of the Zhaoyuan experience; that is, it did not publicize the mass line working method of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee in leading agricultural production deeply and vividly enough. And the emergence of this shortcoming is inseparable from the fact that the newspaper did not go deep enough into reality and did not grasp the many specific characteristics of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee's working methods.
    After vigorously publicizing the general line, the broad masses of peasants not only actively participated in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, but also greatly improved their enthusiasm for increasing production. At the same time, with the development of the country's industry, Chinese peasants are and will be getting more and more new-style farm tools and other equipment. This has created extremely favorable conditions for further carrying out agricultural technology reform. The responsibility of newspapers is to combine the mutual aid and cooperation movement, actively and correctly promote advanced agricultural production experience, promote the broad masses of peasants to carry out mass-based technology reform, and strive to successfully achieve the 1954 production increase plan for grain, cotton, and other economic crops. At present, some newspapers in Northeast China and other regions have strengthened the publicity of promoting advanced agricultural experience on the basis of vigorously publicizing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, which is undoubtedly very necessary. However, some newspapers in some areas have not paid enough attention to the publicity in this regard, which should be improved urgently.

    作好农业生产先进经验的宣传
     湜辛
    报纸上的农业宣传，除了必须启发和引导农民群众组织起来，实行互助合作以外，还必须推动农民群众积极改进耕作技术，提高农业技术水平。在提高农业技术水平方面，推广农业生产中现有的先进经验，是一个重要的环节；这是在目前条件下，挖掘农业生产潜力，提高单位面积产量的主要方法之一。中共中央在一九五三年三月十六日发出的关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示中，除要求农村中的各级党委正确领导互助合作运动外，并要求他们“按照毛泽东同志的‘从群众中来，到群众中去’的指示，把农民群众好的生产经验加以总结提高，然后加以推广”。指出：“这样，农业生产的不断发展和提高就有了保证，我们国家的工业化也就能得到农业方面的配合和支援。”作为党在经济建设中的有力助手，报纸特别是农业地区的报纸，同样应该十分重视农业生产先进经验的宣传，并努力作好这一宣传。
    在推广先进经验、改进农业技术的宣传中，某些报纸曾经走过弯路。有的报纸在土地改革以后，没有明确地指出小农经济的发展方向，积极引导农民走互助合作的社会主义道路，仅仅孤立地宣传改进农业技术问题，在读者中造成一种印象，好像当前农民的任务只是“向自然界作斗争”。这就是没有路线的宣传，并且也不可能掀起真正群众性的技术改革运动。也有少数报纸，强调了互助合作运动，就忽视或放松了改进农业技术的问题，不去努力发现和传播个别地区、个别生产能手已有的先进经验。这就不能有力地批判农民中的“生产到顶”思想和反对干部中的一般化领导作风，动员广大群众充分挖掘生产潜力；并且不能通过推广先进的农业技术来推动互助合作运动。应该认识，推广农业生产的先进经验，必须和互助合作运动相结合。一方面，只有组织起来了的农民，才能更好地运用他们集体经营的优越条件，采用和发展先进的农业技术。另一方面，先进农业技术的推广，又会帮助组织起来的农民增加生产增加收入，从而充实互助合作运动的内容；并教育单干农民认识党和政府对农民生产的关怀，认识组织起来在改进农业技术方面的优越性，从而积极地参加互助合作。这就是生活本身所具有的逻辑。因此，报纸必须善于把推广农业生产先进经验的宣传和互助合作的宣传有机地、密切地结合起来。忽视改进农业技术和孤立地宣传改进农业技术，都是不切实际的。
    有一种认识，妨碍着报纸更充分地宣传农业生产的先进经验。这就是，有的同志认为报纸是党向人民群众进行政治思想教育的工具，它不应该多宣传生产技术，包括农业技术。这是一种片面的看法。既然在提高农业生产的斗争中，改进农业技术具有很大的重要性，既然广大农民已日益不能满足于老一套的落后的耕作方法，报纸上的农业宣传就不能不接触到农业技术问题。报纸如果回避为经济建设事业所提出来的这个问题，它就不免在一个重要的方面脱离了实际，脱离了群众。同时还应该看到，农业生产过程不如工业生产过程那样复杂，因而农业技术也不如工业技术那样复杂、多样。例如合理密植的原则，不仅适用于许多地区，而且适用于许多作物。报纸只要善于通俗地宣传农业技术，一般读者和农民也是容易懂得的。因此，报纸特别是农业地区的报纸，对农业技术的宣传，比对工业技术的宣传负有更大的责任。
    但是省、市以上的党的机关报是政治的报纸，它不同于专业性的报刊，它不必报道一切大大小小的生产技术问题，也不能从单纯业务和技术的观点出发去宣传生产技术方面的先进经验，而应该首先和主要地从先进经验的经济意义和政治意义着眼来进行宣传。报纸主要关心的所在，应是当前生产中的关键问题。它要力求发现和推广在这些关键问题上的典型经验，也就是带有普遍意义的决定性的先进经验。宣传这种决定性的先进经验之所以重要，就是因为一旦这种先进经验普及到广大地区，为千百万农民所掌握，农业生产的水平就能在现有的基础上大大提高一步。以肇源（即郭尔罗斯后旗，下同）丰产经验为例。这个经验不仅在农业生产领导上提供了深入群众总结耕作经验然后加以推广的群众路线工作方法的范例，而且在农业技术上提出并开始解决了当前黑龙江省和东北地区农业增产的关键问题，即实行合理密植，克服普遍存在的缺苗断苗、株数不够、浪费地力的现象；采用这种办法，只是在旧的耕作基础上加以改良，就可以提高单位面积产量一倍到两倍。去年东北各地推广肇源经验的结果，据初步估计，全区因此约增产粮食一百万吨。这说明了推广决定性的先进经验，对于提高农业生产具有怎样重大的意义。东北日报和黑龙江日报正确地认识了肇源经验的意义，在一年多的过程中对这个先进经验进行了大张旗鼓的宣传，并有计划有系统地组织了推广，这就抓住了当前增产中的一个主要矛盾，并对解决这个矛盾作了一定的贡献，从而较好地发挥了报纸推动经济建设的作用。但是并非所有的报纸都善于组织农业技术的宣传。有些报纸常常没有抓住决定性的先进经验，而对一般性的技术问题又作了过多的宣传，结果便产生了“技术性强而先进经验又推广得不好”的缺点。
    和推广工业生产先进经验不同，农业生产先进经验的推广，必须紧紧掌握一个原则，就是要照顾目前小农经济的特点，要照顾农民文化水平低和各地自然条件的差别。这就要求我们的报纸在农业生产先进经验的宣传中，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法和“就地取材，就地推广”的方针。报纸不仅要以这样的原则来指导实际工作，尤其要在自己的宣传报道中深刻地体现上述原则。仅仅按照主观的愿望，企图用一个简单的公式，来推广先进的农业技术，那就是不懂得生活。安徽日报在宣传江苏松江陈永康的水稻丰产经验时，因为不注意如何根据安徽各个不同地区的土质、气候、种籽等条件具体运用，就没有收到应有的效果。而该报在介绍淮北旱地改种水稻和改种高产量作物时，在介绍全苗补苗经验时，由于做到了与重点试验相结合，且又都是本地经验，因而影响很大。这就是很好的说明。但是另一方面，过分强调小农经济的分散性和农业生产的地域性，而不去适应当时当地的生产条件和群众要求，积极地、正确地宣传和推广在本地或外地已经行之有效的先进经验，那也是不对的。有些报纸在去年春耕生产时，在检查了盲目冒进的偏向以后，甚至对当地群众中所总结出来的“深耕细作、合理施肥、稀播密植”等经验也很少宣传。报纸对待农业生产先进经验如果采取自流的态度，就不能不掉在生活的后面。
    我国农民虽然在其长期的生产实践中积累了许多好的经验，正是目前我们进行农业技术改革的出发点；但是同时也要看到，由于我国农民过去是在封建的生产关系和小农经济条件下进行生产的，这些经验还不是很有系统、很科学的。因此，报纸不能满足于仅仅介绍这个或那个生产能手进行耕作的方法，而且应当力求深入地解说他们的工作方法，给经验以科学的总结；应当用先进农业科学的光辉来照耀农民原有的生产经验，去其糟粕，存其精华。要作到这一点，报纸就要加强和农业科学、技术工作者的联系，特别是要吸引他们来参加先进经验的宣传。河南日报在去年四月间河南大部地区遭受霜灾袭击后，一方面及时介绍了巩县回郭镇老农李云生等浇麦保苗的经验，另一方面组织农业专家们从科学的观点上阐明和总结了浇麦的方法，对于提高农民群众战胜自然灾害的信心和推动各地挽救麦苗，起了很大的作用。但是有些报纸关于农业先进经验的宣传，时常犯经验主义的毛病。这些报纸对先进经验的宣传仅仅起了“通知”的作用，对先进经验本身为什么是先进的缺乏深刻的、透彻的说明；有时甚至离开了科学的原则，传播了错误的“经验”。将新的农业科学技术和农民群众在生产实践中的丰富经验结合起来，不断提高我国农业的技术水平，这就是报纸在农业先进经验的宣传中所要达到的目标。不顾当地生产条件和群众要求，机械地搬用所谓“科学技术”，固然是错误的；停留在农民现有的生产技术水平上，不去提高一步，同样是错误的。
    经验证明，先进的农业技术的推广过程，是一系列的新旧斗争过程。对于广大农民来说，这首先是先进思想和保守思想的斗争；对于农业生产的领导来说，这又是群众路线工作作风和一般化领导作风的斗争。报纸只有投入这一斗争的中心，才能有力地指导斗争的开展，为新生事物的普及开辟道路。黑龙江日报在宣传肇源经验上所以取得较大的效果，正是因为编辑部比较深入地到群众中去作了调查研究，熟悉了实际工作和群众思想的情况，掌握了推广这个经验的规律。因此，报纸能够针对群众的思想顾虑，具体而生动地进行新旧耕作方法的对比，说明新耕作法的好处，宣传科学的道理；能够根据肇源推广新耕作法的经验，来指导其他地区的推广工作；并能结合实际运动的发展，及时地树立榜样，扫除思想障碍，揭示推广中的问题。如果报纸不去深入而具体地了解先进经验的成长和推广过程中的主要问题，那自然难以有效地发挥自己的宣传、鼓动和组织作用。有些报纸宣传先进经验所以不能深入人心，推广先进经验所以软弱无力，原因就在这里。自然，黑龙江日报在肇源经验的宣传上，开始时也曾有过缺点；这就是对于肇源县委领导农业生产的群众路线工作方法这一个重要的方面，宣传得还不够深刻和生动。而这一缺点的产生，又是和报纸深入实际不足，没有抓住肇源县委工作方法的许多具体特点分不开的。
    经过大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，广大农民不仅积极地参加了互助合作运动，而且大大提高了增产热情。同时随着国家工业的发展，我国农民正在和将要得到越来越多的新式农具及其他装备。这就为进一步开展农业技术改革工作创造了极为有利的条件。报纸的责任，就是要结合互助合作运动，积极地正确地推广先进的农业生产经验，推动广大农民开展群众性的技术改革，为胜利实现一九五四年粮食、棉花和其他经济作物的增产计划而斗争。目前东北和其他地区的一些报纸，在大力宣传互助合作运动的基础上，已经加强了推广农业先进经验的宣传，这无疑是十分必要的。但是也有一些地区的报纸对这方面的宣传还注意得不够，这是亟应改进的。
