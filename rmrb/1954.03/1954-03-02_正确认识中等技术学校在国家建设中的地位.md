    Correctly Recognize the Position of Secondary Technical Schools in National Construction

    Editor's Note: Many students and graduates of secondary technical schools have written to inquire: Why can't graduates of secondary technical schools directly apply to universities, and why is there a requirement for a certain period of service? Now, we will briefly answer this question as follows:

    We know that socialist construction is a great collective undertaking involving division of labor and cooperation. It requires all kinds of talents. Therefore, in the cause of socialist construction, we not only need a large number of various senior technical cadres, but also a large number of various intermediate technical cadres. As early as 1952, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government pointed out in the "Instructions on Consolidating and Developing Secondary Technical Education": "In about five or six years, the national economic construction will need about 500,000 intermediate and junior technical cadres." Since 1949, our secondary technical schools have developed more than threefold, and the number of students has exceeded more than double the highest annual number during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. A group of intermediate technical personnel has been trained, and many of them have played a role in their work positions. However, according to the actual needs of today's large-scale national economic construction for various intermediate technical cadres, there is still a long way to go. The main task of secondary technical schools is to train intermediate technical cadres for the country. If these students all go to universities after graduation, where will the intermediate technical personnel come from? If a factory only has engineers, experts, and workers but no technicians, and all difficult problems in the production process have to be solved by experts, it is actually impossible. Similarly, if there are no intermediate technical cadres in the entire national economic construction, the progress of socialist construction will be greatly hindered. With the needs of socialist construction for various talents, secondary technical schools must also develop accordingly. Therefore, we not only need a large number of intermediate technical cadres at present, but also more intermediate technical cadres in the future. The past and present experience of the Soviet Union fully tells us this. One of the resolutions of the July 1928 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was: "Expand the network of technical schools and students so that the ratio between the number of engineers and technicians is no less than two to three by the end of the Five-Year Plan." From the academic year of 1930-1931, the number of secondary technical schools and other secondary vocational schools in the Soviet Union greatly developed. In the academic year of 1929-1930, there were a total of 1,115 secondary vocational schools in the Soviet Union. By the following year, that is, the academic year of 1930-1931, there were already 2,955. By the academic year of 1938-1939, there were 3,732, and the number of students increased to 26.6 times that of the pre-war period. According to the plan for restoring and developing the Soviet national economy from 1946 to 1950, the number of students in secondary vocational schools should increase to 1.28 million by 1950. In fact, there were 1.384 million in 1951, which is 38.5 times larger than in 1914. From these figures, we can understand the significant role of secondary technical talents in socialist construction.

    Does this mean that graduates of secondary technical schools have no possibility of entering universities? Of course not. In capitalist countries such as France and the United Kingdom, graduates of secondary vocational schools do not have the right to enter universities. The Kuomintang reactionary rule consistently despised technical education, so technical schools did not have a definite system. The new school system in our country attaches great importance to technical education. Technical schools occupy their proper position in the school system, and secondary technical schools are also connected to various vocational schools. After graduating from secondary technical school and working for a certain period of time, as long as the work can be left and with the consent of the leading unit, one can apply to universities for further study. The interim implementation measures for secondary technical schools stipulate that: "Those who have excellent academic and service performance may be recommended by the competent business department to a higher-level school of the same nature for further study." Therefore, as long as one studies hard and works hard, there are still many opportunities to apply to universities for further study.

    The reason why secondary technical schools occupy a certain important position in the entire national economic construction is originally known to many students of secondary technical schools, but some students clearly know this reason, why are they not at ease in studying in secondary technical schools, and even after graduation are not at ease in intermediate technical work, but are determined to directly apply to universities? This is mainly an ideological problem. They believe that graduates of secondary technical schools "develop slowly," "can't do big things, and it's a waste of talent for small things"; "there is no future for individuals, and the contribution to the country is not great"; "it is better to study at university and become an engineer or expert in the future." Obviously, this understanding is very wrong. Our country uses various methods to train our engineers and experts. Students of secondary technical schools are also intermediate experts trained by the state. Today, every student in the learning position and every technician in the working position has the possibility of developing into a senior expert. The question is how to determine one's professional ideology, settle down to study, and delve into business to give full play to one's wisdom and talents. We have seen that many graduates of secondary technical schools have made great achievements in production positions. Some have been able to serve as factory directors, workshop directors, and surveying team leaders after short-term training in production and construction. Some have made creations and improvements to production soon after leaving school. For example, Yu Baogang, a graduate of Shenyang Mechanical Industry School, created the rapid steel rolling method in Anshan Iron and Steel, Wang Zuoxian improved the sintering furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant, and Zhang Xingzhou improved the iron melting furnace in Xi'an Mining Bureau, and were all named labor models. From this, we should draw the conclusion that the provision of service years in secondary technical schools is not only completely in line with the situation and meets the needs, but also for every graduate of technical schools, after a certain number of years of service, they can enrich their perceptual knowledge, and can also upgrade the problems encountered in practice to the rational stage through research. Therefore, every student and graduate of technical schools must correctly treat the major they have learned, give full play to their greatest wisdom and ability under the supreme principle of serving the collective interests of the people, and obtain true honor. The view that graduates of secondary technical schools do not contribute much is obviously not in line with reality. Our country is building a beautiful and happy socialist society. All students who are studying and have graduated from secondary technical schools should correct their thoughts and attitudes. Obey the needs of the socialist construction of the motherland, and study enthusiastically and diligently. In the future, all secondary technical schools should strengthen the political and ideological leadership of students, thoroughly implement socialist education, so that students can correctly handle the relationship between individuals and the country, correctly understand the present and the future, and strive for the great cause of socialist construction.

### 正确认识中等技术学校在国家建设中的地位

    正确认识中等技术学校在国家建设中的地位
    编者按：很多中等技术学校在校同学与毕业生来信询问：中等技术学校毕业生为什么不能直接投考高等学校，而要规定一定的服务年限？现在，我们对这个问题简单地答复如下：
    我们知道社会主义建设是一项伟大的分工合作的集体事业，它需要各种各样的人材，因此，在社会主义建设事业中，我们不仅需要大批的各类高级技术干部，同样，也需要大批的各类中级技术干部。一九五二年中央人民政府政务院在“关于整顿和发展中等技术教育的指示”中早就指出：“在五六年内，全国经济建设约需中级和初级技术干部五十万人左右。”一九四九年以来我们中等技术学校虽已发展了三倍多，在校学生已超过国民党反动派统治时期的最高年度的一倍以上。并已培养出一批中级技术人员，其中不少已在工作岗位上发挥了作用。但根据今天国家大规模经济建设对各种中级技术干部的实际要求，还距离很远。中等技术学校主要任务是为国家培养中级技术干部，如果这些学生毕业以后都升入高等学校，试问中级技术人员从什么地方来呢？假如一个工厂只有工程师、专家和工人而没有技术员，而生产过程中所有困难问题都要靠专家来解决，事实上是不可能的。同样，在整个国家经济建设中如果没有中级技术干部，对社会主义的建设事业的进展，也会受到很大的障碍。随着社会主义建设对各种人材的需要，中等技术学校还必须相应地发展。因此，我们不仅目前需要大批中级技术干部，将来还需要更多的中级技术干部。苏联过去和目前的经验也充分地告诉我们这一点。一九二八年联共（布）中央七月全会决议就有一条是：“扩大技术学校网与学生，以便到五年计划终结时，工程师与技师数量间的对比不少于二比三。”苏联从一九三○—一九三一学年起中等技术学校和其他中等专业学校的数目有了很大的发展。一九二九—一九三○学年苏联共有一千一百一十五所中等专业学校，到次年，即一九三○—一九三一学年，已经有二千九百五十五所，到一九三八—一九三九学年则有三千七百三十二所，学生较战前时期增加到二六．六倍。按一九四六年到一九五○年恢复与发展苏联国民经济计划的规定，到一九五○年中等专业学校学生数要增加到一百二十八万人，实际上一九五一年已有一百三十八万四千人，即比一九一四年时大三八．五倍。从这些数字中我们就可以了解到中等技术人材在社会主义建设中的重大作用。
    中等技术学校的毕业生是否就全没有升入大学的可能呢？当然不是的。在资本主义国家里如法国、英国等中等专业学校毕业生是没有权利升入高等学校的；国民党反动统治时一贯轻视技术教育，因而技术学校没有一定的制度。我们国家的新学制十分重视技术教育。技术学校在学校系统中占了应有的地位，中等技术学校也是和各种专科学校相衔接的。中等技术学校毕业后经过一定服务年限，只要工作可以离开，并且经过领导单位同意，是可以投考高等学校继续学习的。中等技术学校暂行实施办法中规定：“在校成绩与服务成绩均属优良者，得由主管业务部门保送至高一级同性质的学校继续深造。”因此，只要自己努力学习，努力工作，那么投考高等学校继续深造的学习机会还是很多的。
    关于中等技术学校在整个国家经济建设中占有一定的重要地位的道理，原是好多中等技术学校学生都知道的，但是有些学生明明知道这个道理，为什么偏偏不安心在中等技术学校学习，甚至毕业以后不安心于中级技术工作，而一心要直接投考高等学校呢？这主要有个思想问题。他们认为中等技术学校毕业出来“发展慢”，“大事干不了，小事屈材料”；“对个人没有前途，对国家贡献不大”；
  “不如读大学将来可以做工程师、做专家光荣”。显然，这种认识是十分错误的。我们的国家是用各种方法来培养我们的工程师和专家的。中等技术学校学生也就是国家所培养的中级专家。今天在学习岗位上的学生和工作岗位上的技术人员每个人都有发展成为高级专家的可能。问题在于自己如何确定专业思想，安心学习、钻研业务，以发挥智慧和才能。我们看到有不少的中等技术学校毕业生在生产岗位上做出了很大成绩，有的在生产建设中经过短期训练已能担任厂主任，车间主任，测量队长等职务，有的出了学校不久就对生产有了创造和改进，如沈阳机械工业学校毕业生于保刚曾在鞍钢创造了快速轧钢法，王作先改进了鞍钢化工厂的焙烧炉，张兴周改进了西安矿务局的化铁炉等，并都被评为劳动模范，由此应该得出结论：中等技术学校服务年限的规定不仅完全合乎情况适应需要，而且对每个技术学校的毕业生说来，经过一定年限的服务，既可以丰富自己的感性知识，又可以把实践中所遇的问题经过钻研上升到理性的阶段。因此，每个技术学校的同学和毕业生，必须正确对待自己所学的专业，在服从人民集体利益最高原则下，发挥自己最大的智慧与能力，获取真正的荣誉。那种认为中等技术学校毕业生贡献不大的看法，显然是不符合实际的。我们的国家正在建设美好幸福的社会主义社会，所有中等技术学校在校和毕业的同学应该很好的端正思想和态度。服从祖国社会主义的建设需要，热忱地刻苦地学习。各中等技术学校今后应该加强对学生的政治思想领导，深入贯彻社会主义教育，使同学们正确地处理个人与国家的关系，正确地认识现在和将来，为社会主义建设的伟大事业而奋斗。
