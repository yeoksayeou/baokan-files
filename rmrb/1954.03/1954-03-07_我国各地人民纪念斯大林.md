Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: People across China widely commemorated the first anniversary of the death of the great revolutionary teacher Stalin. Many cities and towns, from the interior to the border regions, held memorial meetings, report meetings, discussion forums, as well as photo exhibitions on Stalin's life and deeds, and exhibitions of Stalin's works. On the 5th, all major and medium-sized cities and small towns across the country flew flags at half-mast in commemoration at Party, government, military organs and people's organizations.

The people from all walks of life in cities where the central bureaus of the Chinese Communist Party are located—Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Xi'an—held memorial meetings on the 4th and 5th. Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau, Song Renqiong, First Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Southwest Bureau, Li Xiannian, Third Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Central and South China Bureau, Li Zhuoran, Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau, and Zhao Boping, Director of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, delivered reports at these memorial meetings. In their reports, they unanimously spoke of Stalin's achievements in leading the Soviet people to build a socialist society and gradually transition to a communist society after Lenin's death, as well as his great contributions to Marxism-Leninism, to the liberation cause of the oppressed nations of the world, and especially to the Chinese revolution. They particularly pointed out that the theory of the transition from capitalism to socialism, created by Marx and Engels and developed by Lenin and Stalin, has great significance for our country's construction of socialism. They called on all Party cadres and all the people to earnestly study Lenin and Stalin's theories, learn from the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people in building socialism, work hard in production and work, and raise socialist consciousness. They also particularly emphasized the importance of strengthening the Party's unity, calling on everyone to unite under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and strive to realize our country's general line and general task during the transition period. At memorial meetings held in Guangzhou, Jinan, Gui Sui, Urumqi, and other cities, the heads of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau, Shandong Sub-bureau, Meng Sui Sub-bureau, and Xinjiang Sub-bureau also delivered memorial reports.

Memorial gatherings and various activities commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death were widely held in cities and villages across the country. On the 4th and 5th, more than 30 cities where the provincial committees of the Chinese Communist Party were located and other large and medium-sized cities held memorial meetings one after another, and the local heads of the CCP committees delivered reports at the meetings. Farmers in Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—Chairman Mao's hometown—gathered on the afternoon of the 5th to commemorate Stalin. Mao Weiang, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Shaoshan Township Branch, reported on Stalin's deeds in assisting the Chinese revolution and construction. Agricultural labor models and model family members of soldiers also spoke at the meeting. In the evening, farmers in various villages held discussion forums. The people of the entire township unanimously pledged to use the action of increasing grain production by 170,000 jin this year to express their commemoration of Stalin. More than 1,000 representatives from various organs, cadres, troops, and schools participated in the memorial meeting held in Yan'an, the sacred place of the revolution. At the discussion forum held in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi, Shanxi, the farm members deeply expressed their gratitude to Stalin for guiding the farmers to take the path of collectivization, and unanimously expressed that they would commemorate him with practical actions to achieve greater harvests. In Anshan and Daye, important steel industry bases in our country, local workers held memorial meetings and various report meetings and discussion forums. At these meetings, the workers engaged in steel industry construction expressed one after another that they would create greater and more new production achievements to commemorate Stalin. In the border areas of the motherland, people of all ethnic minorities held commemorations with the most solemn ceremonies. Memorial meetings were held in the distant cities of Lhasa and Xigaze, and in Manzhouli City and the counties under the jurisdiction of the Heihe area on the Sino-Soviet border. In Pingxiang Town, Guangxi Province, only a dozen kilometers from the Sino-Vietnamese border, more than 600 Zhuang and Han people, as well as Vietnamese repatriated overseas Chinese and Vietnamese expatriates living there, gathered together to express their deep remembrance and respect for Stalin, the great leader of all nations in the world.

On the day of commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death, the broad masses of working people in our country recalled the vows they made a year ago today to turn grief into strength to mourn the great leader. Now these vows have become reality. Liu Guanglu, steelmaking foreman of the foundry workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and Beijing model worker, proposed on behalf of the group at the memorial meeting for Comrade Stalin last year: to improve steelmaking technology and shorten steelmaking time. As a result, from the third day after Stalin's death, the daily steelmaking increased from four furnaces to five furnaces. Later, they learned the Soviet open-hearth single-slag steelmaking method, and the daily steelmaking increased from five furnaces to eight furnaces. The whole group increased production by more than 7 billion yuan for the country last year. Over the past year, the Xin Zixiu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xia Gushan Village, Lushan County, Henan Province, has learned the Soviet advanced rational close planting method, which increased the yield of wheat and rice by 53% to 123% compared with 1952. They also learned the Soviet cotton sowing method, which also increased the cotton harvest by 87.5% compared with the past. These achievements are the result of their implementation of the resolution passed last year, "Commemorating the great teacher by learning from the Soviet advanced agricultural production experience." Now, the people's remembrance of Stalin has formed a new force. Countless workers and farmers have expressed their intention to commemorate Stalin with new production achievements on the day of commemorating this closest friend of the Chinese people. The entire staff of the advanced production workshop of Daye Huaxin Cement Plant—the fine grinding workshop—formulated a plan at their memorial meeting to increase the production of cement by 7,000 tons and cement raw materials by 8,000 tons in the first quarter. Workers in the electric furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant put forward the slogan "In order to commemorate Stalin, we must make steel faster, more, and better." On the same day that the slogan was put forward, the No. 1 electric furnace of the plant created the highest record since the opening of the plant with seven furnaces of steel per day.

    我国各地人民纪念斯大林
    据新华社讯：我国人民普遍纪念伟大革命导师斯大林逝世一周年。从内地到边疆的许多城市和乡镇纷纷举行了纪念会、报告会、座谈会以及斯大林生平事迹图片展览、斯大林著作展览。五日这一天，全国各大、中城市和小城镇的党政军机关和人民团体，都悬挂半旗纪念。
    中国共产党各中央局所在地——上海、重庆、武汉、沈阳、西安等城市的各界人民，在四、五两日分别举行了纪念大会。中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林、中共中央西南局第一副书记宋任穷、中共中央中南局第三副书记李先念、中共中央东北局宣传部部长李卓然、中共中央西北局宣传部部长赵伯平等分别在这些纪念会上作了报告。他们在报告中一致地谈到伟大的斯大林在列宁逝世后领导苏联人民建成社会主义社会并逐步过渡到共产主义社会的功绩，以及他对马克思列宁主义，对全世界被压迫民族解放事业，特别是对中国革命事业的伟大贡献。他们特别指出：由马克思、恩格斯创立而由列宁、斯大林发展起来的由资本主义到社会主义过渡的理论，对我国建设社会主义有着伟大的意义。他们号召全党干部和全体人民认真学习列宁斯大林的学说，学习苏联共产党和苏联人民建设社会主义的经验，努力生产和工作，提高社会主义觉悟。他们还特别强调了加强党的团结的重要性，号召大家团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会领导下，为实现我国过渡时期的总路线、总任务而奋斗。在广州、济南、归绥、乌鲁木齐等城市举行的纪念会上，中共中央华南分局、山东分局、蒙绥分局、新疆分局的负责人也都分别作了纪念报告。
    在全国广大城市和乡村中普遍举行了纪念斯大林逝世一周年的集会和各种活动。四、五两日，全国共有三十多个中共省委所在的城市和其他大、中城市先后举行了纪念大会，当地中共党委负责人都在会上作了报告。毛主席故乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山乡的农民在五日下午集会纪念斯大林。中共韶山乡支部副书记毛伟昂在会上报告了斯大林援助中国革命和建设的事迹。会上还有农业劳动模范和军人家属模范讲话。晚间，各村农民都举行了座谈会。全乡人民一致保证要用今年增产粮食十七万斤的行动来表示对斯大林的纪念。在革命圣地延安所举行的纪念会上，有各机关干部和部队、学校的代表一千多人参加。在山西长治中苏友好集体农庄举行的座谈会上，庄员们都深深感激引导农民走集体化道路的斯大林，一致表示要用获得更大丰收的实际行动来纪念他。在我国重要的钢铁基地鞍山和大冶，当地工人都举行了纪念会和各种报告会、座谈会，在这些会上，从事钢铁工业建设的工人们都纷纷表示：要创造更大更多的新的生产成绩，来纪念斯大林。在祖国的边陲地带，各少数民族人民都用最隆重的仪式来举行纪念。在辽远的拉萨市、日喀则市，在中苏边境上的满洲里市和黑河地区所属各县，都举行了纪念会。在距离中越边境仅十几公里的广西省凭祥镇，六百多名僮族、汉族人民以及居住在该地的越南归国侨胞和越南侨民聚集在一起，向世界各民族的伟大领袖斯大林表示深沉的怀念和敬仰。
    在纪念斯大林逝世一周年的日子里，我国广大劳动人民都回忆起他们在一年前的今天为悼念伟大领袖所作的把悲痛化为力量的誓言。现在这些誓言都已变成事实。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间炼钢工长、北京市劳动模范刘广禄在去年追悼斯大林同志大会上代表小组提出保证：要提高炼钢技术，缩短炼钢时间，结果，从斯大林逝世后的第三天起，每天炼钢就从四炉提高到五炉，以后又学习了苏联平炉单渣炼钢法，每天炼钢又从五炉提高到八炉。全组去年一年就为国家增产七十亿元以上。河南省鲁山县下孤山村辛自修农业生产合作社一年来学习苏联先进的合理密植法，使小麦和水稻的产量比一九五二年提高了百分之五十三到一百二十三，他们又学习了苏联的棉花点播法，使棉花的收获量也比过去提高了百分之八十七点五。这些成绩都是他们执行了在去年通过的“以学习苏联先进农业生产经验来纪念伟大的导师”的决议的结果。现在，人们对于斯大林的怀念又形成了一种新的力量。无数的工人和农民都在纪念这位中国人民的最亲密的朋友的日子里，表示要以新的生产成就来纪念斯大林。大冶华新水泥厂先进生产车间——细磨车间全体工人在他们举行的纪念会上，制订出要在第一季度增产七千吨水泥和八千吨水泥生料的计划。大冶钢厂电炉车间工人提出了“为了纪念斯大林，一定要把钢炼得更快、更多、更好”的口号，就在提出这个口号的当天，该厂第一号电炉就创造了日产七炉钢的开厂以来的最高纪录。
