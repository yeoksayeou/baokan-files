    Mixed Train Service Begins Between Chengdu and Zhongba on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway between Chengdu and Zhongba has started a daily mixed train service in both directions since February 25th to handle transport business. The Chengdu-Zhongba section is 159 kilometers long and officially opened to traffic on January 1st of this year. Zhongba is a distribution center for local products from several nearby counties. Pig bristles, furs, medicinal materials, and tree fungus produced in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Pingwu County in northern Sichuan, and Wenxian and Wudu counties in Gansu Province, are mostly concentrated in Zhongba, and then transferred from Zhongba to Chengdu for sale to various places. In the past, cargo transport between Zhongba and Chengdu mainly relied on carts and a small number of trucks, resulting in low transport capacity and high freight costs. Local specialties often faced sluggish sales. Now, these local specialties can be transported in large quantities by train, and freight costs will be reduced significantly.

    宝成路成都中坝间通混合列车
    宝成铁路成都中坝间，已从二月二十五日起每天对开一次混合列车开始办理运输业务。成都到中坝全长一百五十九公里，是在今年一月一日正式通车的。中坝是附近几个县的土产集散地。四川北部平武县藏族自治区和甘肃省文县、武都等地出产的猪鬃、毛皮、药材、木耳等，大都集中到中坝，再由中坝转运成都销售各地。过去中坝、成都间的货物运输多是用板车和少数汽车，运量不大，运费又高。土特产常有滞销现象。现在这些土特产就可以利用火车大量运出，运费也会降低很多。
