Xinhua News Agency, March 9th:
    341 state-owned, locally state-owned factories and mines in North China, as well as the Kailuan Coal Mine, the largest in North China, exceeded the February national production plan. Among the state-owned and locally state-owned factories and mines, many major factories and mines such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Yangquan Iron Plant, Datong Coal Mine, Fengfeng Coal Mine, Yangquan Coal Mine, Lu'an Coal Mine, Fujiatan Coal Mine, Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau, Datong Power Plant, Tangshan Power Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Plant, Tianjin Power Machine Plant, Tianjin Bicycle Factory, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, Beijing People's Machinery Factory, Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, and Tianjin Paper Mill all completed the February plan.

    The completion of the plan by various factories and mines in North China this month broke the past practice that the February plan often could not be completed. Although there were fewer working days in February, many factories and mines completed the production plan better in February than in January. For example, Kailuan Coal Mine exceeded the plan by 0.09 in January, and exceeded the plan by 1.9 in February. Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau, Jinhua Textile Factory, Taiyuan Paper Mill and other nine factories exceeded the national plan by an average of 6.23 percent in January, and exceeded the national plan by an average of 16.21 percent in February. Yangquan Iron Plant did not complete the plan in January, but it also exceeded the plan by 5.35 percent in February.

    The implementation of the production inspection system and the normal attendance of employees ensured the completion of the February national production plan. In February, leading cadres of many factories in Shanxi Province, Beijing and Tianjin went deep into workshops and production teams to check the implementation of the plan. After the publicity and education of the general line, the attendance of employees in various factories and mines before and after the Spring Festival was generally good. On February 1st and 2nd, 14 factories and mines such as Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory completed the daily plan; employees who returned to their hometowns during the Spring Festival were also able to return to the factory on time. The average attendance rate of employees in ten large factories in Tianjin reached over 94 percent, and the attendance rate of employees in eighteen factories in Shijiazhuang on the first day after the Spring Festival also reached over 95 percent.

    华北区有三百四十一个厂矿
    超额完成二月份国家生产计划
    【新华社九日讯】华北各地有三百四十一个国营、地方国营厂矿和华北区最大的开滦煤矿，超额完成了二月份国家生产计划。在国营和地方国营厂矿中，许多主要厂矿如太原钢铁厂、石景山钢铁厂、唐山钢厂、天津钢厂、阳泉铁厂、大同煤矿、峰峰煤矿、阳泉煤矿、潞安煤矿、富家滩煤矿、太原电业局、大同发电厂、唐山发电厂、太原矿山机器厂、张家口探矿机械厂、天津动力机厂、天津自行车厂、华北农业机械总厂、北京人民机器厂、北京清河制呢厂、天津造纸总厂等都完成了二月份计划。
    华北区各厂矿这一个月完成计划的情况，打破了往年二月份往往不能完成计划的惯例。虽然二月份工作日少，可是许多厂矿完成生产计划的情况二月份却比一月份更好，如开滦煤矿一月份超过计划零点零九，二月份超过计划一点九。太原电业局、晋华纺织厂、太原造纸厂等九个工厂，一月份平均超过国家计划百分之六点二三，二月份平均超过国家计划百分之十六点二一。阳泉铁厂原来一月份没有完成计划，可是二月份也超额百分之五点三五完成了。
    执行生产检查制度和职工的正常出勤，保证了二月份国家生产计划的完成。山西省、北京市和天津市许多工厂的领导干部，二月份都深入车间和生产小组检查计划的执行情况。经过总路线的宣传教育，各厂矿职工春节前后的出勤情况一般也都良好。二月一日和二日，唐山机车车辆修理工厂等十四个厂矿都完成了日计划；春节回乡的职工也都能按期返厂，天津市十个大厂职工春节后出勤率平均达到百分之九十四强，石家庄十八个工厂的职工，春节后第一天的出勤率也达到百分之九十五以上。
