The United States, ever since its failure in the war of aggression against Korea, has been further intensifying the implementation of its plan to rearm Japan. In early May of last year, US Secretary of State Dulles announced that the "Mutual Security Act" was applicable to Japan and used the funds it provided for purchasing weapons as bait, attempting to force Japan to accept "assistance" at a time when its economy was experiencing difficulties due to its shift towards militarization, in order to accelerate rearmament. On the eve of the United States being forced to agree to an armistice in Korea, the "Mutual Security Act Assistance" negotiations between the United States and the Yoshida government officially began in Tokyo on July 15th of last year.

According to Article 511 of the US "Mutual Security Act," all "assisted" countries must do their utmost to contribute to expanding, strengthening, and maintaining the so-called "defense of the free world," and must actively take "all reasonable measures" necessary to develop their own military strength. This provision is no exception for Japan. US Ambassador to Japan Allison made it clear at the first meeting between the US and Japan that Japan's acceptance of this "assistance" would require it to take various "reasonable measures" necessary to develop its military strength and to "fulfill its military obligations under multilateral or bilateral agreements and treaties involving the United States." Since the start of negotiations between the US and Japan to conclude the "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," the bourgeois newspapers and news agencies of the US and Japan have made no secret of the US's aim to make Japan the main supplier of cannon fodder in the US's planned Pacific aggression bloc. US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson said after the agreement was signed that this agreement was the "beginning of a major plan" to expand the Japanese army. The Associated Press also reported that this agreement would lead to Japan's participation in an "American-backed Pacific pact."

During the eight months of negotiations between the US and Japan, the US repeatedly urged Japan to formulate a rearmament plan, particularly requesting Japan to focus on expanding its ground forces. Dulles clearly stipulated in the US Senate on July 9th of last year that Japan should expand its 110,000-man "Security Force" to ten divisions, 350,000 men. The Japanese bourgeois magazine "Toyo Keizai Shinpo," published on November 14th of last year, pointed out: "The number of 350,000 is roughly equivalent to the ground forces currently sent by the United States to the Far East." This shows that in order to realize its vicious plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," the United States is attempting to use Japanese mercenaries to extricate itself from the Far East.

Due to the fierce opposition of the Japanese people and actual economic difficulties, the Yoshida government was unable to fully meet the US's demands on the issue of expanding armaments. However, during the negotiations, the Yoshida government constantly put forward plans to expand armaments to the United States, and had long been preparing to revise the "Security Agency Law" in order to complete the legal procedures for expanding US mercenaries in preparation for accepting "Mutual Security Act assistance." On March 2nd, the Yoshida government submitted two rearmament bills to the Diet: the "Self-Defense Forces Law" and the "Defense Agency Organization Law." These bills stipulate that the "Security Force" expanded by US military "aid" be renamed the "Self-Defense Forces," the current disguised military department "Security Agency" be renamed the "Defense Agency," the "Self-Defense Forces" can be dispatched to serve as US aggressive cannon fodder, and a "reserve voluntary system" is adopted to expand the source of troops. At the request of the United States, the Yoshida government has already made preparations for expanding the army in the 1954 fiscal year budget. These concrete measures show that the Yoshida government's emphasis on the difficulty of Japanese rearmament to the United States is a lackey's bargaining with its master. The Japanese Jiji Press's "Political and Business Report" long ago stated bluntly that the Yoshida government's approach in the US-Japan negotiations was to "resist as much as possible in order to get as much (dollars) from the United States as possible." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also said: The Yoshida government believes that "Japan does not need to take a rash attitude. The United States knows Japan's importance in the Far East and will not abandon Japan because of this."

With the United States using "Mutual Security Act Assistance" as a means to collude with Japanese reactionaries to drag Japan into the US's Asian aggression plan in this new step, the US and Japanese reactionaries will further intensify their enslavement of the Japanese people. Simultaneously with accepting US military "assistance," the Yoshida government is stepping up preparations to revive militarist rule. The Yoshida government is forcing the Diet to formulate laws to deprive teachers and staff of the right to engage in political activities and restore wartime police rule, and is also preparing to submit bills such as the "Military Secrets Protection Law," which suppresses freedom of speech and publication during wartime, to the Diet in accordance with the conditions for accepting US "Mutual Security Act assistance." In the economic field, Yoshida has already asked the Japanese people to live a "tightening their belts" life. The rearmament that comes with the signing of the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" will only make Japan's economy shift more towards military production and deepen Japan's economic crisis. Many Japanese economists have constantly written articles pointing out the harm of rearmament to the Japanese economy. Usami Seijiro, a professor at Hosei University in Japan, published a commentary in the "Chuo Koron" magazine entitled "Accepting Mutual Security Act Assistance is Asking the People to Tighten Their Belts," pointing out that the US's "assistance" is being carried out on the basis of making the Japanese people live a "tightening their belts" life. After accepting "Mutual Security Act assistance," the increasingly heavy burden of military spending will plunge the people's lives into an even more miserable situation, Japan's economy will be further militarized, and US monopoly capitalists will also use the path opened up by "assistance" to further control the Japanese economy. In order to obtain excessive profits from exploiting colonies, they will inevitably lower the wages of Japanese workers and destroy Japanese national industry and commerce. Usami Seijiro emphasized that as a result of accepting US "Mutual Security Act assistance," the "tightening their belts" life will, along with the fascistization of the political system, trap the Japanese people in a state of military prison.

### 美日“共同防御援助协定”把日本进一步推向扩军备战的危险道路

    美日“共同防御援助协定”把日本进一步推向扩军备战的危险道路
    美国自从在侵略朝鲜战争中失败，就在进一步加紧执行重新武装日本的计划。去年五月初，美国国务卿杜勒斯宣布“共同安全法”适用于日本，并以它提供了购买武器的款项为钓饵，企图乘日本经济因转向军事化而发生困难的时机迫使日本接受“援助”，以加速重新武装。在美国被迫在朝鲜停战的前夕，美国和吉田政府之间的“共同安全法援助”谈判在去年七月十五日正式在东京开始举行。
    按照美国“共同安全法”第五百五十一条规定，凡受“援”国都必须尽力对扩充、加强和维持所谓“自由世界的防御”有所贡献，并须积极地采取对发展本身军事力量所必要的“一切合理措施”。这个规定对于日本也不例外。美国驻日本大使艾利逊在美日双方第一次谈判会上就明确地说明：日本接受这种“援助”，就必须采取各种发展它的军事力量所需的“合理措施”，必须“履行它在有美国参加的多边或双边协定和条约中所承担的军事义务”。自从美日双方谈判缔结“共同防御援助协定”以来，美日资产阶级的报纸和通讯社并不掩饰美国的目的是要使日本充当美国策划中的太平洋侵略集团中的主要炮灰供应者。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在协定签字后说：这个协定是扩充日本军队的“一个大计划的开始”。合众社的消息也说，这个协定将导向日本参加一个“美国支持的太平洋公约”。
    在美日双方八个月的谈判过程中，美国一再督促日本拟订重整军备计划，特别是要求日本着重扩充地面部队。杜勒斯在去年七月九日在美国国会参议院明确地规定：日本应将拥有十一万人的“保安队”扩充到十个师，三十五万人。去年十一月十四日出版的日本资产阶级的“东洋经济新报”杂志曾指出：“三十五万人这个数目，大体相等于现在美国派到远东的地面部队。”这就表明，美国为了实现它的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒计划，企图利用日本的雇佣兵来使自己从远东“脱身”。
    由于日本人民的激烈反对和经济方面的实际困难，吉田政府未能在扩充军备的问题上完全满足美国的要求。但是在谈判过程中，吉田政府不断向美国提出了扩充军备的计划，并为接受“共同安全法援助”早就在准备修改“保安厅法”，为扩充美国雇佣兵完成法律手续。三月二日，吉田政府向国会提出了“自卫队法”和“防卫厅组织法”两项重整军备的法案。这些法案规定把美国军事“援助”所扩充起来的“保安队”改名为“自卫队”，目前的变相军部“保安厅”改名为“防卫厅”，“自卫队”可以出动去充当美国侵略炮灰，并采用“后备志愿制度”以扩充兵源。按照美国的要求，吉田政府已在一九五四会计年度预算中作了扩充军队的准备。这些具体措施说明：吉田政府向美国强调日本重整军备困难，是奴才对主子的讨价还价手段。日本时事通讯社出版的“政界特报”早就一语道破说：在美日谈判中，吉田政府的办法是“尽量抗拒，以便尽量从美国要得更多（美元）”。“读卖新闻”也说：吉田政府认为：“日本无需采取急躁的态度。美国深知日本在远东的重要性，不会因此就把日本丢开”。
    随着美国以“共同安全法援助”为手段，勾结日本反动派把日本拖入美国的亚洲侵略计划的这个新步骤，美国和日本反动派将进一步加紧奴役日本人民。与接受美国军事“援助”同时，吉田政府正在加紧准备复活军国主义统治。吉田政府正在强制国会制订剥夺教职员政治活动权利和恢复战时警察统治的法案，还准备按照接受美国“共同安全法援助”的条件向国会提出战时压制言论出版自由的“军机保护法”之类的法案。在经济方面，吉田已经要求日本人民过“勒紧裤带”的生活。随着美日“共同防御援助协定”的签订而来的重整军备，只会使日本的经济更加转向军事生产，加深日本的经济危机。日本许多经济学者曾不断著文指出重整军备对日本经济的危害。日本法政大学教授宇佐美诚次郎就曾在“中央公论”杂志上以“接受共同安全法援助是要求国民勒紧裤带”为题发表评论指出：美国的“援助”是在使日本国民过“勒紧裤带”的生活的基础上进行的。在接受“共同安全法援助”后，越来越沉重的军费负担将使国民的生活陷于更悲惨的境地，日本的经济将进一步军事化，而美国垄断资本家也将利用“援助”所打开的道路进一步控制日本经济。他们为了获得剥削殖民地的超额利润，就必然要降低日本工人的工资和破坏日本民族工商业。宇佐美诚次郎着重说：由于接受美国“共同安全法援助”的结果，“勒紧裤带”的生活将和政治体制的法西斯化一道，使日本人民陷于军事监狱的状态中。（新华社）
