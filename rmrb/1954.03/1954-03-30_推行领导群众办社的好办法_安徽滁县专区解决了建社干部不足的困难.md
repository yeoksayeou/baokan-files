Good Methods for Promoting Leadership by the Masses in Running Cooperatives
Chuxian Prefecture, Anhui Province, Solves the Difficulty of Insufficient Cadres for Cooperative Building

    In the past year, Anhui Province's Chuxian Prefecture had two leadership methods in establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives: one was "cadres stationed in cooperatives, dividing forces to guard," and the other was "leadership in control, masses running it themselves." In areas that adopted the former leadership method, such as the Shiliying Cooperative in Xuyi County, cadres were stationed in the cooperative for a long time, taking over everything, which caused a serious dependence mentality among the masses. Even trivial matters such as twisting cow ropes, selling grass, or even family disputes among cooperative members had to be resolved by the stationed cadres. In the Ding Houjie Cooperative in Fengyang County, the accounts were managed by the stationed cadres. When Lian Zhuang Cooperative was established in Langya Township, Chuxian County, the stationed cadres took over everything, staying in the cooperative for a year without daring to let go. As a result, the cooperative was still not run well. This year, some places still adopted this leadership method in establishing cooperatives, which resulted in a great shortage of cadres at the county and district levels, causing some mutual aid teams that were qualified to transition to cooperatives to be delayed and not transitioned in time. The latter method of running cooperatives generally yielded great results. This method involves "inviting in" representatives from surrounding new cooperatives and mutual aid teams to learn from the experience of key cooperatives while stationed cadres lead the establishment of key cooperatives, and "sending out" personnel from key cooperatives to spread experience, so that key cooperatives drive the development of surrounding cooperatives and groups, with county and district cadres only assisting, keeping abreast of the situation, and providing timely guidance. In 1953, Dianfa and Machang Townships in Banta District, Lai'an County, under the influence of the Dayuying Cooperative, developed eight new cooperatives by adopting this leadership method. This year, the entire district adopted this leadership method, and under the guidance of the old cooperatives, thirty-one new cooperatives were established in seven townships. Although there were only five people in the work group working in these townships, they did not feel that it was difficult to run the cooperatives because they relied on the masses to spread experience and run the cooperatives on their own initiative. This year, many areas in Chuxian Prefecture also used other methods in establishing cooperatives, such as establishing joint meetings of cooperative directors in districts and townships, mobilizing the first established cooperatives to lead the later established cooperatives, and organizing members of newly established cooperatives to visit members of old cooperatives to promote and lead the work of establishing cooperatives, all of which have achieved great results. The district is now further promoting this leadership method.

    推行领导群众办社的好办法
    安徽滁县专区解决了建社干部不足的困难
    安徽省滁县专区在去年建立农业生产合作社中，有两种办社的领导方法：一种是“干部驻社，分兵把守”，另一种是“领导掌握，群众自办”。采用前一种领导方法的地方，如盱眙县十里营社，因为干部长期驻社，包办代替，造成群众严重的依赖思想，社内搓牛绳、卖草，甚至社员家庭发生纠纷等的零碎事情，都要找驻社干部解决；凤阳县丁侯杰社的账目收支都由驻社干部掌管；滁县琅琊乡建立连庄社时，驻社干部包办代替，在社里住了一年，还不敢放手，结果社仍然没有办好。今年在建社中，有些地方还采用了这一领导方法，就发生了县、区干部力量大感不足的现象，竟使若干已经够条件转社的互助组，拖延下来，没有及时转社。采用后一种办社方法的，一般的都收到很大效果。这一方法是，在驻社干部领导重点社建社的时候，就把周围要建立的新社和互助组的代表“请进来”学习经验，把重点社的人员“派出去”传播经验，使重点社带动周围社、组发展，县、区干部只是从旁帮助，掌握情况，及时指导。一九五三年来安县半塔区殿发、马厂两个乡，就是采用这一领导方法，在大余营社的影响下，发展了八个新社；今年全区采用这一领导方法，在老社的带动下，又在七个乡建立了三十一个新社。在这些乡工作的工作组虽然只有五个人，可是因为依靠群众自己传播经验，主动办社，并没有感觉到社多不好办。滁县专区不少地区，今年在建社中，还运用了其他各种办法，如在区、乡建立社主任碰头会、发动先建立的社带领后建立的社，组织新建社的社员访问老社社员等的办法，推动和领导建社工作，都收到很大成效，现该区正进一步推广这一领导方法。
