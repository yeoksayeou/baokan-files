The Disaster of the South Korean People
　　Li Gao

　　Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, once pointed out: "From the first day the United States entered the southern half of our country until today, it has consistently implemented its pre-prepared plan, which is to colonize our country, enslave our people, and turn our country's territory into a base for its aggression in the Far East." (Report at the rally in Pyongyang on August 15, 1950, commemorating the fifth anniversary of the "August 15" liberation) Facts have proved that after the US aggressors suffered defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, which they launched to realize this plan, they have not abandoned their arrogant attempt. On the one hand, it continues to undermine the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and attempts to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; on the other hand, it is stepping up various measures in the southern half of Korea, which it occupies, to turn South Korea into a US base of aggression and a colony.

　　After the signing of the armistice agreement, when the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party called on the people to devote all their efforts to restoring and developing the post-war people's economy and strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the United States signed the so-called "US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Li Seung-man gang on August 8. According to this treaty, the United States attempts to "legitimize" the "indefinite" occupation of South Korea by sending troops, and tightly bind the Li gang to the US war machine. The Korean people pointed out that this treaty is nothing more than a replica of the "Japan-Korea Protection Treaty" that Japanese militarists forced the traitorous government of the Li Dynasty to sign in 1905.

　　Under US occupation, not only is the command of the South Korean army under the United States, and all military strongholds, transportation lines, and ports in South Korea are already "forbidden areas" for the United States, but all South Korea's internal affairs and diplomatic powers are controlled by the United States. The so-called "United Nations Civil Assistance Command in Korea" and various US-established institutions in the name of "aid" control all sectors of South Korea's industry, finance, finance, food, culture and education, and even the examination of refugees, the right of ordinary residents to ride in vehicles, and the licenses of street vendors are subject to their management. The Li Seung-man puppet regime is nothing more than an auxiliary institution used by the United States to suppress the people, collect cannon fodder, and plunder military expenses and resources in South Korea.

　　In accordance with the will of the United States, the Li Seung-man gang announced a so-called nine-point military plan on the fourth day after the Korean armistice, including "systematically conscripting strong men into the army" and "implementing an effective militia system" and other military expansion measures. Up to now, the United States has successively announced the expansion of four divisions of the Li puppet army after the armistice. At the same time, the Li gang forced all young and middle-aged people in South Korea aged 17 to 40 to undergo fascist military training in the name of the pseudo "militia team" in order to expand the army on a large scale. Van Fleet and others openly said that using the Li puppet army to replace the US army to carry out aggressive tasks can save the United States more than 95% of the money. This is an arrogant plan in the US so-called "new look" military aggression policy.

　　This "cheap" calculation in the US aggression plan is based on the unlimited increase of the war burden on the South Korean people. An Associated Press dispatch on February 13 this year revealed that the Li gang's current "annual military expenditure - about one billion US dollars, is only 400 million US dollars less than South Korea's national income." That is, on average, for every seven yuan the South Korean people earn, five yuan will be plundered for military expenses. The so-called "aid" given by the United States to Li Seung-man is also a disguised way to increase the burden on the South Korean people. According to the so-called "economic agreement" signed by the United States and the Li Seung-man gang in Seoul on December 14 last year, the Li gang must provide "counterpart fund" deposits for the materials and labor of the US "aid," and the right to use this "deposit" belongs to the so-called "Joint Economic Board" controlled by the United States. In this way, for every dollar of so-called "aid" the United States gives to the Li gang, the Li gang must plunder another dollar from the South Korean people to supply his American masters for aggressive purposes.

　　In order to completely turn South Korea into a US colony, the United States, under the guise of "aid," on the one hand, sells US surplus products and plunders resources in South Korea, and on the other hand, uses various excuses to prevent South Korea from restoring its industry. A "special investigation team" headed by Henry J. Tasca, appointed by Eisenhower, publicly released a report after its activities in South Korea stating that South Korea should continue to import US domestic surplus commodities such as butter and non-fat milk powder. The Associated Press reported: "US representatives made a guarantee in Japan that the funds for aiding (South) Korea will be spent in Japan, so that Japan's economy can continue to be supported." Wood, the US person in charge of the so-called "economic aid" in South Korea, repeatedly stated: "South Korea is not yet at a time when it can establish industry," it "should use the funds of the (US) Foreign Operations Administration to import consumer goods." In this way, the so-called "aid" that the United States gives to South Korea, in addition to being used for military purposes and to step up the mining of tungsten sand and other minerals exclusively for US plunder, the rest is used to import consumer goods that hit South Korea's civilian industry. South Korea's industry, which was almost completely collapsed during the war, shows no signs of recovery. The US "International News Service" revealed on January 24 that the US and Li were drafting a so-called "Korean Five-Year Plan," which is all about building military facilities convenient for the US occupiers and some government buildings to decorate the facade, and there is no mention of industry and agriculture. Not only that, but US monopoly capital also wants to use the former Japanese colonial institutions that it has revived to return to South Korea to step up its plunder. For example, the Japanese "Oriental Development Company," which plundered Korea for 40 years, has made a request to the Li gang to "return" their previous property in South Korea, and the stock of this colonial "company" has been approved for sale in the United States.

　　These measures taken by the United States in South Korea have first and foremost caused the South Korean people to continue to suffer boundless suffering. After the Korean armistice, the people in the northern half of Korea have been rapidly rebuilding a peaceful life and striding forward on the bright road of vigorously restoring and building the national economy, with rapid recovery of industry and agriculture, steady decline of prices, and stable people's lives. Now, a large-scale three-year construction plan has begun, and in the words of a "Times of India" reporter, "the whole country is a wave of construction." But in South Korea, millions of people are still locked up in the Li Seung-man gang's concentration camp-style "shelters" or wandering around the city and countryside, homeless. South Korea's young and middle-aged people are either snatched away by the Li gang's conscription team or thrown into the ranks of the unemployed. According to the Li gang's own admitted figures, there are more than two million unemployed people in South Korea. The South Korean working people not only have to suffer the direct plunder of the Li gang's hundreds of kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies, but also suffer the indirect plunder of inflation and rising prices. As of February 15 this year, the amount of counterfeit currency issued by the Li gang had swelled to 24.6 billion won, an increase of 120% over a year ago, which is more than 900 times the amount of currency in circulation in South Korea at the time of Korea's "August 15" liberation. Last December, the United States and the Li Seung-man gang devalued the South Korean counterfeit currency by two-thirds in an "agreement." Prices in South Korea have continued to rise after the armistice. Even according to the greatly reduced statistics published by the pseudo "Bank of Korea," the "cost of living index" in early March was 75% higher than in July last year. At the same time, the wages of workers and employees were "frozen" and reduced. The South Korean people have generally fallen into hunger. In 1953, South Korea lacked as much as 7.17 million stones of grain, and the Li gang also planned to transport 1.5 million stones of looted grain to Japan in exchange for munitions. This has made starvation, starvation, suicide, and begging fill every corner of South Korea. In Busan alone, about 1,600 people died on the streets last year. Foreign reporters reported: "The streets of Seoul are full of hungry and cold children." According to the figures admitted by the pseudo "Ministry of Health," there are as many as 313,000 "waitresses" in South Korea, and more than 30% of them are sick.

　　At the same time, in order to implement the slavery policy of the American masters, the Li gang, under the direct instructions of the United States, greatly strengthened the secret service, police organizations, and other various activities to suppress and slaughter the people. According to the Li gang's so-called "Field Headquarters for the Suppression of Guerrillas," in December 1953 alone, in 34 counties and cities in South Korea, the Li gang, under the pretext of "suppressing" the people's guerrillas, burned down the houses of more than 171,000 people, robbed the food of more than 658,000 people, and seized the clothes of more than 563,000 people. These situations, as a reporter for the "Times of India" said: "In short, Li Seung-man's South Korea is, in the words of a South Korean reporter: 'a place of death and dying'."

　　Under the enslavement and plunder of foreign interventionists and the Li Seung-man reactionary government, the South Korean people are increasingly resisting strongly. They long for an early end to the current deep disaster. The upcoming Geneva Conference should respect the wishes of the Korean people, help Korea restore national unity on the basis of Koreans solving their own problems, and lead Korea from armistice to lasting peace.

    南朝鲜人民的灾难
  　李　高
    朝鲜人民的领袖金日成元帅曾经指出：“美国从进驻我祖国南半部的头一天起直到今天，一贯地实施着他们早有准备的计划，即是使我祖国殖民地化，奴役我们人民，变我祖国疆土为他们侵略远东的基地的计划。”（一九五○年八月十五日在平壤“八·一五”解放五周年庆祝大会上的报告）事实证明：美国侵略者在为实现这一计划而发动的侵朝战争中遭遇失败之后，仍未放弃它的狂妄图谋。一方面，它不断地破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施并企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决；另一方面正在它所占据的朝鲜南半部加紧进行使南朝鲜变成美国侵略基地和殖民地的各种措施。
    停战协定签订后，当朝鲜劳动党中央委员会第六次全体会议号召人民全力恢复和发展战后人民经济，争取祖国的和平统一的时候，美国却在八月八日和李承晚匪帮签订了所谓“美韩共同防御条约”。根据这个条约，美国企图派兵“无限期地”占领南朝鲜“合法化”，并把李匪帮紧紧地缚在美国战车上。朝鲜人民指出：这一条约无异是一九○五年日本军国主义者迫使李朝卖国政府签订的“日韩保护条约”的翻版。
    在美国占领之下，不但南朝鲜的军队指挥权属于美国，南朝鲜所有军事要冲、交通运输线和港口等早已是美国的“禁地”，而且南朝鲜的全部内政、外交权都操在美国手里。所谓“联合国军民事处”以及美国以“援助”为名建立的各种机构，控制着南朝鲜的产业、金融、财政、粮食、文化教育等各个部门，甚至连难民的审查、一般居民的乘车权、摊贩的执照也受它们的管理。李承晚的傀儡政权，不过是美国利用来在南朝鲜镇压人民、搜括炮灰、掠取军费和资源的一种辅助机构罢了。
    禀承着美国的意志，李承晚匪帮在朝鲜停战后的第四天就公布了一个所谓九点军事计划，其中包括“有系统地征调壮丁入伍”、“实行有效的民兵制”等扩军措施。到目前为止，美国在停战后已先后宣布扩建了四师李伪军。同时，李匪帮又以伪“民兵队”名义强迫南朝鲜所有十七岁到四十岁的青壮年都要受法西斯军事训练，以便大规模扩充军队。范佛里特等公然说：使用李伪军以代替美国军队执行侵略任务，美国所花的钱可以少百分之九十五以上。这就是美国所谓“新面貌”军事侵略政策中的一个狂妄打算。
    美国侵略计划中的这种“廉价”算盘，是以无限制地加重南朝鲜人民的战争负担为基础的。合众社今年二月十三日电透露：李匪帮目前“每年军费开支——约十亿美元，仅比南朝鲜的国民收入少四亿美元。”即南朝鲜人民平均每收入七块钱就要被掠去五块钱做军费。美国给李承晚的所谓“援助”，也是一种变相地加重南朝鲜人民负担的办法。根据去年十二月十四日美国和李承晚匪帮在汉城签订的所谓“经济协定”，李匪帮必须为美国“援助”的物资和劳务提供“对等基金”存款，而这种“存款”的动用权属于美国掌握的所谓“联合经济局”。这样一来，美国每给李匪帮一块钱所谓“援助”，李匪帮就必须向南朝鲜人民身上搜括另一块钱来供他的美国主子用于侵略目的。
  为了把南朝鲜彻底地变成美国的殖民地，美国又假“援助”为名一方面在南朝鲜推销美国剩余产品和掠取资源，另一方面又以各种借口阻止南朝鲜恢复工业。由艾森豪威尔指派的亨利·杰·塔斯卡为首的一个“特别调查团”在南朝鲜活动后公开发表报告说：南朝鲜应该继续输入美国国内的牛油、脱脂奶粉等剩余商品。合众社报道：“美国代表们在日本提出了保证说，援助（南）朝鲜的款项将在日本花费，这样就可继续支持日本的经济。”美国派在南朝鲜主持所谓“经济援助”的负责人伍德屡次声言：“南朝鲜还不到能建立工业的时候”，它“应该用（美国）援外事务管理署的款项输入消费品”。就这样，美国给南朝鲜的所谓“援助”，除了供军事用途及用来加紧开采专供美国掠夺的钨砂等矿产之外，其余的就用来输入打击南朝鲜民用工业的消费品。战时已经近乎全部垮台了的南朝鲜工业，没有一点点恢复的迹象。美国“国际新闻社”在一月二十四日透露了美李双方正在拟订中的一个所谓“韩国五年计划”，这个“计划”中全部是搞一些便利美国占领者使用的军事设施和一些装饰门面的政府建筑物之类的“建设”，其中只字也未提到工业和农业。不仅这样，美国垄断资本还想假手它所复活起来的前日本殖民机构重新回到南朝鲜以加紧进行掠夺。例如曾经在朝鲜劫掠了四十年的日本“东方开发公司”等，已向李匪帮提出了“归还”它们以前在南朝鲜的财产的要求，这个殖民“公司”的股票并已获准在美国出卖。
    美国在南朝鲜的这些措施，首先是使南朝鲜人民继续遭受无边的苦难。朝鲜停战后，朝鲜北半部人民已在迅速重建和平生活、大力开展恢复和建设国民经济的光明大道上猛步前进，工农业迅速恢复，物价稳步地降低，人民生活安定。现在又开始了大规模的三年建设计划，用“印度时报”记者的话说，“全国到处是建设的浪潮。”可是在南朝鲜，数百万人仍然被关在美李匪帮的集中营式的“收容所”里或漂泊城乡流落无依。南朝鲜青壮年不是被李匪帮的征兵队抓走就是被抛入失业群中。仅据李匪帮自己承认的数字，南朝鲜竟有二百万以上的失业者。南朝鲜劳动人民不仅要遭受李匪帮数百种苛捐杂税的直接搜括，而且还要受通货膨胀、物价上涨的间接掠夺。到今年二月十五日为止，李匪帮的伪币发行额膨胀到了二百四十六亿圆，比一年前增加了百分之一百二十，为“八·一五”朝鲜解放时南朝鲜货币流通额的九百倍以上。去年十二月美国和李承晚匪帮在一次“协议”中，就将南朝鲜伪币贬值三分之二。南朝鲜的物价在停战后仍是不断上涨。即使根据伪“韩国银行”发表的大大缩小了的统计，三月初的“生活费用指数”也比去年七月提高了百分之七十五。同时，工人、雇员的工资却被“冻结”和降低。南朝鲜人民普遍沦入饥饿中，一九五三年南朝鲜缺粮达七百一十七万石之多，而李匪帮还计划以掠夺来的粮食一百五十万石输往日本换取军火。这就使冻死、饿死、自杀和乞食者充满了南朝鲜的每一角落。仅在釜山市内，去年就约有一千六百人死在街头。外国记者报道说：“汉城街上到处是饥寒的儿童。”据伪“卫生部”承认的数字，南朝鲜的“女侍”多达三十一万三千余人，而且其中患病的占百分之三十以上。
    与此同时，李匪帮为了执行美国主子的奴役政策，又在美国直接指使下大大加强特务、警察组织和其他各种镇压、屠杀人民的活动。据李匪帮的所谓“讨伐游击队野战司令部”承认，仅一九五三年十二月在南朝鲜的三十四个郡和市境内，李匪帮就以“讨伐”人民游击队为名，烧掉了十七万一千多人的房子、抢光了六十五万八千多人的粮食和抢夺了五十六万三千多人的衣物。这些情况，正如“印度时报”一个记者所说的：“简而言之，李承晚的南朝鲜就是，用一个南朝鲜记者的话来说：‘死亡和垂死的地方’。”
    南朝鲜人民在外国干涉者和李承晚反动政府的奴役和掠夺下，日益坚强地进行反抗。他们渴望早日结束目前的深重灾难。即将举行的日内瓦会议应该尊重朝鲜人民的愿望，帮助朝鲜在朝鲜人自己解决自己的问题的基础上恢复国家的统一，并使朝鲜从停战导向持久的和平。
