Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th. In the capitalist world, while hundreds of millions of working people are in a state of not having enough to eat or wear, the warehouses of many capitalist countries' governments and enterprises are piling up with more and more so-called "surplus" grain and cotton.

According to a report released by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on the 21st, the stocks of wheat, rice, butter, cheese, skim milk powder, vegetable oil, and cotton held by the governments and enterprises of many countries in the capitalist world have "increased significantly" in the past year. These stocks are hoarded by governments and capitalists in order to maintain the high prices of commodities, even though working people are increasingly unable to afford their food and clothing.

The organization pointed out that most of these stocks are piled up in the United States. In this country, even according to the materials acknowledged by Truman during his presidency, one-third of the population eats very poorly. The organization also pointed out that the large-scale accumulation of agricultural products is currently a "fairly widespread problem" in the capitalist world. In Southeast Asia, a large amount of rice is stockpiled. Cuba has a large amount of sugar and tobacco in storage. Italy has a lot of tobacco in storage. Some Mediterranean countries have a large backlog of dried fruits. The Netherlands has a large backlog of milk powder. The amount of these stockpiled items is rapidly increasing. By July 1954, rice stocks may have nearly doubled compared to last December, and wheat and cotton stocks are likely to increase by 20 to 33 percent this season.

According to the organization's report, the phenomenon of large-scale "surplus" of agricultural products in capitalist countries has aroused concerns in many countries. The organization convened a meeting of a "working group" composed of representatives from Argentina, Egypt, France, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States on the 23rd to specifically study the so-called "commodity surplus problem." According to a United Press report, at the biennial conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization held last December, "the surplus problem has become one of the main issues of discussion, and many countries have expressed concern that the situation may develop as it did in the 1930s." United Press admitted that despite the existence of large food-deficient areas in the capitalist world, a plan to use these "surplus" grains by a unified international organization to relieve famine was abandoned at this meeting because representatives from the United States and other grain-producing countries expressed "lack of enthusiasm."

    资本主义世界农产品“过剩”危机日益严重
   【新华社二十七日讯】华盛顿消息：在资本主义世界里，当亿万劳动人民处于吃不饱、穿不暖的状态时，许多资本主义国家的政府与企业的仓库中却堆积起愈来愈多的所谓“剩余”粮食和棉花。
    据联合国粮食与农业组织二十一日发表的报告说：在过去一年内，资本主义世界许多国家的政府与企业手中积存的小麦、大米、牛油、乳酪、脱脂奶粉、植物油与棉花“大大增加”。这些存货是政府和资本家为了保持商品的高昂价格而囤积起来的，虽然劳动人民已愈来愈买不起他们的衣食。
    该组织指出：大部分这种存货堆积在美国。在这个国家里，即使按照杜鲁门在任总统时所承认的材料，也有三分之一的人口吃得很坏。该组织同时指出：农产品大量堆积目前已经是资本主义世界“颇为广泛的问题”。在东南亚地区，积存了大量的大米。古巴积存了大量的糖和烟草。意大利积存了许多烟草。某些地中海国家积压了大量干水果。荷兰积压了大量奶粉。这种积压起来的物品量还在迅速增加。到一九五四年七月，大米的存货可能比去年十二月增加差不多一倍，小麦与棉花的存货很可能在本季节增加百分之二十至百分之三十三。
    据该组织的报告说，资本主义世界各国农产品大量“过剩”的现象已经引起了许多国家的忧虑。该组织已在二十三日召开一个由阿根廷、埃及、法国、印度、荷兰、新西兰、联合王国与美国的代表组成的“工作小组”的会议，专门研究所谓“商品过剩问题”。据合众社的消息说，在去年十二月举行的粮食与农业组织两年一度的大会上，“过剩问题已成为讨论的主要问题之一，许多国家表示担忧情况可能像三十年代那样发展。”合众社承认：在这次会上尽管资本主义世界存在大量缺粮区，但是一个把这些“过剩”粮食由一个统一的国际组织用来救济饥荒的计划，却因美国与其他产粮国的代表表示“不热心”而放弃。
