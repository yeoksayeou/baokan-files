    The Civil Aviation Industry of New China
    Peng Cheng
    With the help of the Soviet Union, and after four years of effort since liberation, China had a total of 15,900 kilometers of civil aviation routes by the end of 1953. Starting from Beijing, there are several routes to reach famous cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, Nanning, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Harbin, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Urumqi. There are also three international routes connecting to Chita, Almaty, and Irkutsk in the Soviet Union, and connecting with the Soviet civil aviation routes to reach Moscow and the capitals of various People's Democratic countries in Eastern Europe. The establishment and development of the civil aviation industry are of particular importance to our country, because China is one of the largest countries in the world. Cities like Kunming and Urumqi are not considered very remote in our country, but if using railways and highways, it would take about eleven days to travel from Beijing to Kunming, and at least thirteen days to Urumqi. Even taking a train from Beijing to Lanzhou takes four days. With civil aviation, these cities are now at most within one or two days of travel.
    A few years ago, the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed many airports and equipment when they fled. These airports and equipment have now been restored and rebuilt one after another, and some places have even greatly exceeded the original scale. The civil aviation industry of New China has seen great development.
    The civil aviation industry of New China is entirely dedicated to serving production and peaceful construction. The silver planes bearing the five-star red flag carry cadres, engineers, and workers busy with national construction, as well as Soviet experts helping with our country's construction. Shanghai electrical workers Shi Liangkui and Zhang Quanxin flew from Shanghai to Beijing, and then transferred to a plane to Harbin to repair generators. Many leaders of state organs also often travel by plane to attend meetings or arrange work. Many cultural and trade groups visiting New China are also part of the passengers on civil aviation international and domestic routes. In addition, some students and housewives occasionally travel by plane for private affairs.
    Patients traveling by plane for treatment receive special care from civil aviation staff. Last December, Dai Boliang, a surveying intern from the Central Communications Department's Navigation Bureau, was injured on duty. When he flew from Hankou to Beijing for treatment, the pilot showed him great concern, specially selecting an altitude with relatively stable airflow and using particularly gentle movements during take-off and landing.
    Our country is undergoing large-scale construction, and a large amount of materials needs to be transported. Due to its rapid nature, civil aviation transportation undertakes the task of transporting urgent materials needed in various places. For example, a factory in Chongqing lacked diamond drill bits in its production, and the Fuxin Mining Bureau needed enameled wire in its basic construction project. These materials were all transported by air. Because air transport was able to deliver these urgently needed materials in a timely manner, it ensured that the construction of these projects and the production of factories and mines would not be interrupted. In 1953, more than 50 percent of civil aviation freight was industrial equipment. This included precision instruments, design drawings, samples, and raw materials, some of which were as light as less than one kilogram, while others were as heavy as more than one ton. Last November, a chemical factory in Shanxi obtained the entire oxygen production machine through air transport. Because of the rapid arrival of this machine, many factories in the area received oxygen supply in advance and completed their tasks on schedule.
    In the summer of 1953, civil aviation aircraft carried out locust extermination tasks in Jiangsu for the first time. The locust extermination work was done very well, with a kill rate of 80 percent. Aircraft sprayed powder over more than 100,000 mu, replacing 350,000 person-days of manual labor, saving the state at least 3.5 billion yuan.
    Insecticide powder, fine Xinjiang sheep breeds, Jiangnan silkworm eggs, fish fry, and plant seeds used in agricultural production are sometimes also transported by plane. Parts of several national newspapers, most of the films, and some medicines and daily necessities operated by state-owned trading companies are frequently transported by air. Thanks to air transport, people in Chongqing can read Beijing's newspapers on the same day three days a week; residents of major central cities can also see newly released movies at almost the same time. Last autumn, in order to meet the needs of schools in Kunming in a timely manner, the government used air transport to supply young students with more than ten tons of textbooks.
    The Chinese people, engaged in the great cause of peaceful construction, particularly understand the importance of forest resources for various construction tasks. In order to prevent and eliminate forest fires, mass forest protection and fire prevention work is being carried out in vast forest areas. The Civil Aviation Administration has been dispatching aircraft to participate in forest protection and fire prevention work since 1952. During the forest protection season, more than 100,000 square kilometers of forest area are closely protected under the patrol of aircraft every day. If a fire is detected, the aircraft immediately notifies and directs ground personnel to rescue. Sometimes, the aircraft airdrops food and clothing to residents entering the mountains to fight fires, or distributes propaganda materials for forest protection education in the forest area. Using aircraft to participate in forest protection work is an unprecedented initiative in our country's history; this initiative has formed a huge political encouragement among residents in forest areas. An old villager, because he was too old to go up the mountain to fight fires, specially sent his son to go. He said: "The plane is here, how can we not go?"
    In 1953, the Civil Aviation Administration and the Central Forestry Department cooperated to conduct the first trial of forest photography work. The national forestry authorities will use the photos to create detailed maps, which will be used as important data for formulating forest development plans. Last year, the Central Forestry Survey Agency used civil aviation aircraft to conduct a forest inspection of more than 700,000 square kilometers. During this inspection, some new forests were discovered.
    In 1953, the Civil Aviation Administration cooperated with the Central Geological Department to conduct an experimental flight to detect mineral deposits using aircraft. This is based on the advanced experience of the Soviet geological department, installing an instrument on the aircraft that is sensitive to magnetism, which can be used to fly over mining areas. The type and direction of underground mineral deposits can be read from the instrument's records. This experiment completed the area that took two years to survey manually in only three flights. Further trials of this advanced survey technology on a larger scale are being planned and prepared.
    In socialist countries and people's democratic countries, aircraft have become an important tool for promoting the improvement of various productive forces. Because China's civil aviation has always taken Soviet civil aviation as its development direction and learning model, the ability of civil aviation staff in New China to actively promote the application of civil aviation in various professional production departments is inseparable from the guidance of Soviet civil aviation's advanced experience.
    For more than three years, China's civil aviation industry has maintained a high degree of safety. Since its opening, the new civil aviation has not had any accidents involving passenger casualties, or even lost or damaged luggage or cargo. The high political responsibility of civil aviation staff and the continuously improving technology and systems based on learning from Soviet advanced experience are important guarantees for the new civil aviation to maintain a high degree of safety. Moreover, China's civil aviation has relied on unremitting investigation and organization of passenger and cargo sources, striving for and organizing reasonable allocation according to the tonnage of flights, so that an average of more than 84.6 percent of the tonnage has been utilized. Such a high load factor cannot be achieved by any airline in capitalist countries.
    Civil aviation personnel have also made great achievements in the production increase and economy drive. Taking flight personnel as an example, they have greatly saved gasoline consumption for each flight by careful calculation and improved operating methods. In July last year, all flight personnel saved 5.8 percent compared with the prescribed fuel consumption.
    For more than three years, the Civil Aviation Administration has repeatedly lowered fares. For example, the fare between Beijing and Chongqing is now 35.6 percent lower than when the route opened in 1950.
    The civil aviation industry of New China is currently in a young and growing period. Because our country is one of the largest countries in the world, such a vast territory first provides the necessary and favorable conditions for the development of civil aviation. The large-scale flow of personnel and materials caused by our country's huge construction undertaking will inevitably require correspondingly more air transport. We still have many provincial capitals and medium-sized cities, as well as many border areas that are not yet accessible by air, and in the future, many air routes will be needed to connect them. Using aircraft for sowing, fertilizing, pest control, and weeding also has a very broad field in future collectivized agriculture. Using aircraft to scout for schools of fish and hunt marine animals in fisheries and hunting, as well as using aircraft for various scientific expeditions and surveying work, are all tasks we want to try to carry out. It is entirely possible to estimate the development of New China's civil aviation industry according to the scale and speed of the development of the Soviet civil aviation industry during the socialist construction period.

    新中国的民用航空事业
    鹏程
    中国人民在苏联的帮助下，解放后经过四年的努力，到一九五三年年底共有长达一万五千九百公里的民用航空线。由北京出发，有好几条航线可以通达上海、武汉、重庆、昆明、南宁、广州、沈阳、哈尔滨、西安、兰州和乌鲁木齐等著名城市；还有三条国际航线，通向苏联境内的赤塔、阿拉木图、伊尔库茨克，和苏联的民用航空线衔接起来，通达莫斯科以及东欧各人民民主国家的首都。民用航空事业的建立和发展，对我国有着特别重要的意义，因为我国是世界上领土最大的国家之一，昆明和乌鲁木齐这样的城市，在我国并不算是十分边远的，但是，如果利用铁路和公路，由北京到昆明就要花费十一天左右的时间，由北京前往乌鲁木齐至少要十三天左右。就是由北京坐火车到兰州也需要四天时间。这些城市在有了民用航空之后，最多处在一两天的航程以内了。
    几年以前，国民党反动派在逃走时，破坏了很多地方的机场和设备。这些机场和设备，现在已先后恢复和重建了，有些地方还大大地超过了原有的规模，新中国的民用航空事业有了很大的发展。
    新中国的民航事业完全是为生产与和平建设事业服务的。在标志着五星红旗的银色飞机上，载运着忙于国家建设工作的干部、工程师、工人和帮助我国建设的苏联专家。上海电机工人施凉奎和张泉鑫从上海搭飞机到北京，在北京换乘飞机往哈尔滨去修理发电机。国家机关很多的领导人员为了参加会议或布置工作也常常搭机来往。来新中国访问的很多文化和贸易团体也是民航国际和国内航线上旅客的一部分。另外有的学生和家庭妇女，也偶尔因为私人事务搭机旅行。
    乘飞机移地治疗的病人，更受到民航工作人员的特别照顾。去年十二月，中央交通部航务总局的测量实习生戴伯良因公致伤，由汉口搭机到北京治疗时，驾驶员对他表示了极大的关怀，特地为他选择了气流比较平稳的高度，并且在起落时采用了特别轻柔的动作。
    我们国家正在进行大规模的建设，大量的物资需要运输。民航运输由于具有快速的特点，便承担着输送各地需要的紧急物资的任务。例如重庆某厂生产中缺少金钢钻，阜新矿务局在基本建设工程中需要漆包线，这些器材都是利用空运送到的。由于空运能够及时送到这些急要的器材，保证了这些工程的建设和厂矿的生产不致于中断。一九五三年民航货运中有百分之五十以上是工业器材。其中包括精细仪器、设计图纸、样品和原料，这些东西轻便的每件不到一公斤，笨重的可以达到一吨多。去年十一月间，山西有一家化学厂利用空运取得了全部制氧的机器；因为这批机器的迅速到达，使该地很多工厂提前获得了氧气供应，如期完成了任务。
    一九五三年夏天，民航飞机在江苏首次担任了灭蝗的任务。灭蝗的工作做得很好，杀伤率达到了百分之八十。飞机喷粉达十多万亩，代替了三十五万个人工工作日，至少替国家节约了三十五亿元。
    农业生产上所用的杀虫粉，优良的新疆羊种，江南蚕种，鱼苗和植物种子有时也是利用飞机来运送的。几家全国性报纸的一部分，大部分电影片，以及国营贸易公司经营的一部分医药用品和日用百货经常交空运。由于有了空运的关系，人们在重庆一个星期中有三天可以读到当天北京的报纸；各大中心城市的居民也可以在差不多同一时间内看到新出的电影片。去年秋天，政府为了及时供应昆明各学校开学的需要，曾经利用空运供给青年学生们十吨以上的教科书。
    从事于巨大和平建设事业的中国人民特别了解森林资源对于各项建设工作重要的意义。为了防止和消灭森林火灾，在广大的林区内进行着群众性的护林防火工作，民用航空局从一九五二年起派遣了飞机参加护林防火的工作。在护林季节，每天有十多万平方公里的林区在飞机的巡逻下受到严密的防护；如果发现火情，飞机立刻通知并指示地面人员去施救。有时飞机替入山救火的居民投送粮食和衣物，或者在林区散发护林教育的宣传品。使用飞机来参加护林工作，是我国历史上从来没有过的创举；这一创举在林区居民中间形成了巨大的政治鼓舞力量。有一位老乡因为年纪大了不能上山去救火，特地派了他的儿子去。他说：“飞机都来了，我们还能不去吗？”
    一九五三年民用航空局和中央林业部合作，首次试办森林摄影的工作。国家林业机关将根据照片制成详图，用来作为制定森林开发计划的重要资料之一。中央林业调查机关在去年使用民航飞机进行了一次七十多万平方公里的森林视察。在这一次视察中，有些新的森林被发现了。
    民用航空局在一九五三年和中央地质部合作，使用飞机进行了一次试验性的探测矿藏的飞行。这是按照苏联地质部门的先进经验，在飞机上装置一种对磁性产生感应的仪器，用以飞过矿区，就可以从仪器的记录上读出地下矿藏的种类和走向等。这次试验中只用三次飞行就测完了过去用人工勘测了两年的区域。进一步在更大的范围内试用这一先进的勘测技术正在计划和准备中。
    在社会主义国家和人民民主国家内，飞机已经成为促进各种生产力提高的重要工具之一。由于我国民航一向以苏联民航为自己发展的方向和学习榜样，新中国的民航工作人员能够积极努力推广民航在各专业生产部门中的应用，是和苏联民航先进经验的指导分不开的。
    三年多来，我国民用航空事业一直保持着高度安全性。新民航自开航以来没有出过伤亡旅客、甚至没有出过遗失损毁行李货物的事故。民航工作人员的高度政治责任心和在学习苏联先进经验基础上不断完善起来的技术和制度，是新民航能够保持高度安全性的重要保证。而且我国民用航空事业依靠对客货源进行了不懈的调查和组织，按照班机吨位争取和组织了合理的配载，使平均有百分之八四点六以上的吨位获得了利用。这样高的载运比率是任何资本主义国家里的航空公司所不能达到的。
    民用航空事业人员在增产节约运动中也取得很大成绩，以飞行人员为例，他们由于精打细算，改进了操作方法，大大节约了每次飞行消耗的汽油。去年七月份全体飞行人员较规定耗油量节约百分之五点八。
    三年多来，民用航空局曾多次降低运价。如以北京重庆间的票价为例，现在已经比一九五○年开航时降低了百分之三五点六。
    新中国的民用航空事业目前还处在年轻的成长的时期，由于我国是世界上领土最大的国家之一，这样广阔的国土就首先提供了必须和有利于发展民航的条件。我们国家巨大建设事业所引起的大规模人员和物资的流动，必然会需要有相适应的更多的航空运输。我们还有很多省城和中等城市，也还有许多边区目前还没有通航，将来都需要用很多航空线把他们连接起来。利用航空播种、施肥、杀虫和除草，在今后的集体化的农业中还有着非常广阔的园地。在渔业和狩猎方面使用飞机侦察鱼群和猎捕海兽，以及使用飞机于各项科学考察和勘测工作都是我们所要尝试开展的工作。新中国的民用航空事业完全有可能按照苏联民用航空事业在社会主义建设时期发展的规模和速度来估计自己的发展。
