Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on the 26th that the National Committee of the Communist Party USA issued a statement regarding the US Congress's commencement of discussions on a bill to outlaw the Communist Party. The statement said: The discussion of a bill to outlaw the Communist Party demonstrates that American-style fascism—McCarthyism—has become alarmingly rampant in our national life. Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany also began with outlawing the Communist Party. The passage of such a law will make it clear to the world that McCarthyism rules our Congress.

    The fascist methods are essentially the same: first, attack and slander the Communists, then attack and slander all those who oppose fascism. In McCarthyism's view, it is only a logical step from slandering the Communist Party as rebellious to scolding the Democratic Party's twenty years of rule as treasonous. From outlawing the Communist Party to outlawing trade unions, black organizations, New Deal Democrats, and liberal Republicans is also part of the same ruthless fascist approach.

    This kind of bill violates the basic principles of the United States. It will inevitably trample on freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association. The congressmen know that our Constitution explicitly prohibits outlawing an organization by name. The fact that they are even considering this step—passing an unconstitutional bill of attainder—shows how seriously some congressmen have violated traditional constitutional standards.

    The reactionary monopoly capitalist groups in our country hope to use these bills to stop the people's increasingly strong resistance to the developing economic crisis, the huge war budget, and the activities that have already begun to actively undermine our democratic system.

    The issue here is not whether one agrees with communism or not. The issue is entirely about defending the Constitution. To defend the democratic rights of all, it is necessary to defend the rights of Communists.

    The passage of such a law would allow the flood of McCarthyism to run rampant. It would inevitably undermine the trade union movement, which has long recognized that to protect the American standard of living, it is necessary to protect American civil rights. This law would also inevitably trample on the right of every American to express his or her thoughts on domestic and foreign policy, on peace, on black rights, on the high cost of living, and on all current issues.

    We call on all workers, masses, and fraternal organizations who cherish the fundamental rights of the American people to loudly protest this un-American bill.

Note: Since Eisenhower issued the call to outlaw the Communist Party USA in his State of the Union address this January, more than a dozen bills demanding that the CPUSA be declared illegal have been introduced in the US Congress. The House Judiciary Subcommittee began discussing these bills on March 18.

### 美共指责美国国会开始讨论反共法案  号召全国人民起来保卫美国人民的民主权利

    美共指责美国国会开始讨论反共法案
    号召全国人民起来保卫美国人民的民主权利
    【新华社柏林三十日电】纽约“工人日报”二十六日报道，美国共产党全国委员会就美国国会开始讨论取缔共产党的法案事发表声明。声明说：讨论取缔共产党的法案是表明美国式的法西斯主义——麦卡锡主义已在我们的全国生活中令人吃惊地猖獗起来，墨索里尼的意大利与希特勒的德国也是从取缔共产党开始的，通过这样的法律将使全世界清楚地看到麦卡锡主义统治着我们的国会。
    法西斯的一套办法在本质上是相同的：先是对共产党人进行攻击与诽谤，然后对所有反对法西斯主义的人进行攻击与诽谤。在麦卡锡主义看来，从诽谤共产党造反到责骂民主党的二十年统治是卖国统治，只不过是一个逻辑步骤而已。从取缔共产党到取缔工会、黑人组织、主张新政的民主党人与自由主义的共和党人同样也是冷酷的法西斯办法的一部分。
    这种法案破坏了美国的基本原则。这必然会蹂躏思想自由、言论自由、出版自由与结社自由。议员们知道我们的宪法明文禁止指名取缔一个组织。他们甚至还考虑这个步骤——通过一个褫夺公权的违宪法案，这说明了某些议员多么严重地违背了传统的宪法标准。
    我们国内的反动垄断资本集团，希望通过这些法案来制止人民对于发展中的经济危机、庞大的战争预算以及已经开始的积极破坏我们的民主制度的活动的越来越有力的反抗。
    这里问题不在于同意还是不同意共产主义。问题完全在于保卫宪法。要保卫一切人的民主权利，就必须保卫共产党人的权利。
    通过这种法律就会使麦卡锡主义的洪水得以到处为害。这必然会破坏工会运动，工会运动早就认识到要保卫美国的生活水平，就必须保卫美国的民权。这种法律同样必然会蹂躏每一个美国人说出他对内政与外交政策、对和平及对黑人权利与生活费用高昂以及所有当前问题的想法的权利。
    我们号召所有珍视美国人民基本权利的工人、群众与兄弟组织大声疾呼，反对这种非美法案。
    按：自今年一月艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中发出取缔美国共产党的叫嚷后，美国国会中即有人接连提出了一打以上的要求宣布美共为非法的法案。众议院司法小组委员会从三月十八日起已开始讨论这些法案。
