    Hunan Province Mobilizes Farmers to Build Small-Scale Farmland Irrigation Projects
    In order to ensure a bumper harvest this year, Hunan Province has mobilized more than 2 million farmers to participate in the construction of small-scale farmland irrigation projects. After the completion of these projects, the irrigated area in mountainous regions will be expanded by more than 2 million mu, and more than 1 million mu of rice fields in lake areas will be reduced or exempted from waterlogging disasters. At present, the Dongting Lake dike maintenance project in the lake area is nearing completion, and the focus is beginning to shift to waterlogging drainage, slope protection projects, and planting shoreline forests. Projects in mountainous areas started later, but about 60% of all projects have now been completed. This includes the completion of more than 70,000 ponds, more than 12,000 dams, more than 100 reservoirs, and more than 8,000 other projects that have been repaired and newly built. Farmers in the mountains and valleys of the upper reaches of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers originally had experience in building mountain valley reservoirs. After liberation, the People's Government summarized and promoted this experience. Now, many reservoir networks have been built in areas around Xupu County in western Hunan. This year, more than 400 reservoirs have been started across the province, including eleven large-scale demonstration reservoir projects invested by the government with more than 5 billion yuan, which have completed 50% of the original plan.
    Because of the short time and heavy tasks involved in this year's water conservancy projects in Hunan Province, leadership at all levels attached great importance to this work from the beginning. Many members of the CPC Prefectural Committees and County Committees personally went to the countryside to lead the masses in rushing to repair water conservancy facilities, and organized inspection teams to conduct inspections and help the masses solve difficulties. Changde Prefecture organized 63 inspection teams with more than 260 cadres to work in the countryside. Shaoyang Prefecture also organized six inspection teams to go to the countryside for inspection. All localities also paid attention to concentrating the efforts of cadres and the masses to tackle key projects and projects with more problems. At present, the spring plowing production season is approaching. In order to complete the winter repair projects in a timely manner and prepare for spring plowing production, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and the Hunan Provincial People's Government recently transferred more than 200 cadres from directly affiliated agencies, organized six inspection teams led by ministers and directors of various departments and bureaus, and went to various places to conduct inspections and promote rural production. The Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee also issued "Opinions on Current Water Conservancy Work," requiring all localities to complete water conservancy projects before mid-March in order to switch to spring plowing production in a timely manner, and at the same time to prevent and correct the tendency of hasty completion.

    湖南省发动农民兴修小型农田水利
    湖南省为保证今年丰收，发动了二百余万农民参加小型农田水利的兴修工程。这些工程完工后，山区将可扩大灌溉面积两百余万亩，湖区将可减少和免除一百多万亩稻田遭受渍灾。现在，滨湖地区洞庭湖堤垸岁修工程已接近全部完工，开始重点转向排渍、护坡工程和植护岸林等工作。山区工程开始较晚，目前已完成全部工程百分之六十左右，计已完工整修与新修的塘七万多口，坝一万二千多条，水库一百多个，其他工程八千多处。湘、资、沅、澧上游的丛山峡谷中的农民，他们原来就有修建山谷水库的经验，解放后，人民政府又加以总结推广，现在湖南西部溆浦县一带已修成许多的水库网。今年全省又动工修建四百多座水库，其中政府投资五十多亿元修建的规模较大的十一座示范水库工程，已完成原计划百分之五十。
    湖南省今年水利工程由于时间短、任务大，各级领导机关对这一工作开始就很重视，很多中共地委和县委委员多亲自下乡领导群众抢修水利，并组织检查组巡回检查，帮助群众解决困难。常德专区各县组织了六十三个检查组，二百六十多名干部下乡工作。邵阳专区也组织六个检查组下乡检查。各地并注意集中干部、群众力量突击重点工程和问题较多的工程。目前，春耕生产季节已经迫近，为了及时完成冬修工程，做好春耕生产的准备工作，最近中共湖南省委和湖南省人民政府又抽调了直属机关二百多名干部，组织六个检查组、由各部、厅长带领分赴各地进行检查和推动农村生产工作。省委农村工作部并发出“对当前水利工作的意见”，要求各地在三月中旬以前全部完成水利工程，以便及时转入春耕生产，同时也要防止和纠正草率收工的偏向。（邓光诰）
