On the morning of March 4th at 7:00 AM, three enemy European-African battalions, under the cover of three tanks and numerous cannons, advanced in two directions towards Hill 836 north of Dien Bien Phu. One route directly attacked the hill, while the other attempted to encircle the People's Army from the flank.

Fierce fighting continued until 5:00 PM, during which the enemy launched a total of twelve attacks, all of which were repelled by the People's Army. The enemy was finally forced to retreat. The attacking enemy forces suffered approximately one company in casualties, and the two ambulances and four large trucks that returned to Dien Bien Phu were filled with wounded and dead enemy soldiers.
