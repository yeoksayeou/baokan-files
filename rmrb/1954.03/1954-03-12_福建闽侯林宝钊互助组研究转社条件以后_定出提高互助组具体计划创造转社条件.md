Following the study of the General Line, some members of the Lin Baozhao Mutual Aid Team in Zhouwei Village, Minhou First District, Fujian Province, were highly enthusiastic and actively demanded to transition to a cooperative. However, recently, when the team specifically assessed the conditions for transitioning, they discovered that the conditions were not yet met. They decided to continue improving the mutual aid team, focusing on cultivating core members, enhancing the collective spirit of the team members, and conscientiously implementing mutually beneficial policies, to create the conditions for establishing a cooperative this winter.

After studying the General Line, Lin Baozhao, the leader of the Lin Baozhao Mutual Aid Team, wanted to transform the mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative. However, at the time, he did not understand that establishing a cooperative required not only enthusiasm but also the necessary conditions. The team's specific situation last year was that mutual aid and mutual benefit were not sufficiently implemented. For example, work point recording and accounting were nominal, and the accounts for spring plowing and drought resistance were not settled for a long time. Mutual aid was only practiced when digging river mud and clearing fields, while there was no mutual aid in harvesting rice or general drought resistance activities. Therefore, the foundation of mutual aid was not yet solid. In January, when the team leader Lin Baozhao heard that the Lin Changtai Mutual Aid Team in the village was going to establish a cooperative, he discussed it with the deputy leader Lin Dasui and also wanted to establish a cooperative. They convened a meeting of ten team members for discussion, fully expecting to establish the cooperative at once. However, four team members remained silent at the meeting. When their opinions were solicited after the meeting, two households with more land and less labor were afraid of suffering losses if they joined the cooperative and said, "You go ahead first, I'll wait a while." The other two households did not clearly understand the nature of agricultural production cooperatives, so they also hesitated and said, "Let's see what happens next season." Therefore, the team's current transition to a cooperative is not desired by all members.

Lin Baozhao and Lin Dasui informed Lin Changtai, the head of another newly established agricultural production cooperative, about this situation and asked for his help. Lin Changtai, knowing that their team's mutual aid foundation was weak and that the conditions for transitioning to a cooperative were not yet met, advised them to improve the mutual aid team and establish a cooperative when the conditions were met. However, Lin Baozhao and Lin Dasui felt that it was not glorious to fail to establish a cooperative after all their efforts, so they no longer wanted to be the leaders of the mutual aid team. They both requested to leave the team and join Lin Changtai's cooperative. Lin Changtai politely refused, saying, "You are the leader and deputy leader, like the helmsman on a ship. If my cooperative takes you in, it will wreck your team, which is not good." Lin Dasui could not understand and went to the county for instructions. After clarifying the situation of his team, the comrades of the County Party Committee's Mutual Aid and Cooperation Committee helped him analyze the conditions that his team did not meet for transitioning to a cooperative: First, the team members were not truly voluntary; second, the core members for establishing a cooperative, other than Lin Baozhao, had not been cultivated; and third, the past mutual aid equivalence had not been done well. If these conditions were ignored and the transition to a cooperative was forced, it would not be easy to consolidate in the future. At the same time, it was pointed out that leading the mutual aid team to improve production was equally glorious and also supported national construction; if the mutual aid team was well-managed and the conditions for establishing a cooperative were met, the cooperative would not take detours in the future. Lin Dasui understood this reasoning and returned to the village to explain these principles to Lin Baozhao, which dispelled the idea of forced cooperation. From then on, Lin Baozhao and Lin Dasui clearly recognized the shortcomings of their team and criticized their unrealistic and face-saving thinking within the team.

Subsequently, they convened a large meeting of team members. After a lively discussion, all team members decided to consolidate and improve the mutual aid team, actively create conditions, and establish a cooperative this winter. The unanimous opinion of the entire team was: in the future, we must strengthen the work of cultivating core members, the leader and deputy leader should often learn from the Lin Changtai cooperative, and the team should first cultivate an accountant and a technician; in terms of mutual aid and mutual benefit, we should try our best to achieve mutual aid in all aspects, and the work point recording and accounting should be clear; the team should accumulate a certain amount of public funds this year to further expand production and develop production. After several discussions, the team finalized this year's production plan. Now, the enthusiasm of all team members for production is even greater, and the leader and deputy leader also expressed their commitment to lead everyone in laying a solid foundation for establishing a cooperative. The four team members who originally disagreed with establishing a cooperative also stated that they would contribute their land as shares in the autumn and participate in the agricultural production cooperative after seeing that the mutual aid team was consolidated.

    福建闽侯林宝钊互助组研究转社条件以后
    定出提高互助组具体计划创造转社条件
    福建省闽侯一区洲尾村林宝钊互助组的一些组员，在学习总路线以后，一时热情很高，都积极要求转社。但最近该组具体衡量转社条件时，发觉条件还不具备，就决定继续把互助组提高一步，从培养骨干、提高组员集体主义思想和认真执行互利政策等方面，来创造条件，准备今年冬天办社。
    林宝钊互助组在学习总路线后，组长林宝钊就想把互助组转为农业生产合作社。但是他当时不明了办社不光是要有热情，还需要具备办社的条件。该组去年的具体情况是，互助互利做得很不够，如记工算账有名无实，春耕、抗旱的账很长时间结不清；在生产上挑河泥、通田时才互助，割稻和一般抗旱活动都没有互助。所以互助的基础还不稳固。在一月里，组长林宝钊听说村里林长泰互助组要办社，就和副组长林大遂商量，也要办社，他俩召集十户组员开会讨论，满以为一下子就可以把社办起来了。可是在会上有四户组员不讲话，会后征求他们的意见，有两户土地多、劳力少的怕入社吃亏，便说：“你们先走一步，我缓一缓”，另外两户对农业生产合作社的性质都认识不清，因此也犹豫不决地说：“看看下季再说吧。”所以该组现在转社也不是组员都愿意的。
    林宝钊和林大遂把这种情况告诉了另一新建立起来的农业生产合作社社长林长泰，要他帮助。林长泰因为平日知道他们组的互助基础薄弱，转社还不够条件，就劝他们好好提高互助组，等具备了条件再办社。但是林宝钊和林大遂觉得闹了半天办社，现在又办不成，实在不光荣，就不想当互助组长了。他们两人要求离开组，自己去参加林长泰社，林长泰婉言拒绝说：“你们是正副组长，好像船上的掌舵的一样，我社收了你们，就把你组拉垮，这可不好。”林大遂想不通，又跑到县里请示，县委互助合作委员会的同志问清楚了他组的情况以后，便帮助他分析他组还不够转社的条件：第一、组员还没有真正自愿；第二、办社的骨干除林宝钊外，其他社干部没有培养起来；第三、过去互助等价也没有做好。如果不顾这些条件，勉强转社，将来也不容易巩固。同时指出，领导互助组把生产搞好，也一样光荣，同样是支援了国家建设；互助组办好了，具备了办社条件再办社，以后就不会走弯路。林大遂懂得了这番道理，回村又把这些道理讲给了林宝钊，才把勉强办社的想法打消了。林宝钊和林大遂从此更认识清楚了自己组里的缺点并在组里批判了自己不切实际，爱面子的思想。
    接着，他们召集组员开了一个大会，全组组员经过热烈讨论，决定要巩固和提高互助组，积极创造条件，在今年冬天办社。全组一致的意见是：今后要加强培养骨干的工作，正副组长应时常向林长泰社学习，组内还应先培养一个会计和一个技术员；在互助互利方面，要尽量在各方面做到互助，记工算账要清楚；组里在今年并积一定数量的公积金，以进一步扩大生产，发展生产。组里经过几次讨论，最后并订出了今年的生产计划。现在全组组员的生产劲头更大了，正副组长也表示要全力领导大家打好办社基础。原来不同意办社的四户组员，见到互助组巩固了，也表示秋后要把土地入股，参加农业生产合作社。
