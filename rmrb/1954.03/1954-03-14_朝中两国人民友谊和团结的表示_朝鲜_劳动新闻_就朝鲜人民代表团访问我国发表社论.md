Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 13th: "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on March 13th entitled "A Symbol of Friendship and Solidarity Between the Chinese and Korean People" on the departure of the Korean People's Delegation to visit China.

The editorial begins by stating: The friendship and solidarity between the people of China and Korea, forged with blood under the banner of proletarian internationalism, is higher than Mount Tai and deeper than the sea. The friendship and solidarity between the people of China and Korea are being consolidated and developed day by day, and this noble spirit will forever flow in the veins of the people of both countries.

The Korean people will never forget the great benevolence of the Soviet people in liberating and assisting us, the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people forged in the common struggle, and the great assistance that our Chinese brothers continue to provide us.

The editorial points out: The enormous assistance that the fraternal Chinese people continue to provide during our period of reconstruction, together with the assistance from the people of other fraternal countries led by the Soviet Union, is an important guarantee for the victory of the Korean people's reconstruction and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Therefore, we Korean people are deeply concerned and strive to further strengthen the friendship and solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people, and continuously strengthen the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Sending a delegation to visit China this time stems from this deep concern and sincerity. The delegation will visit the construction achievements of the Chinese people and convey the struggle stories of the Korean people in order to further consolidate and strengthen the fighting friendship, solidarity, and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Korean people.

The editorial then points out: The continuous strengthening of the friendship, solidarity, and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Korean people is an important guarantee for consolidating and developing the great victory achieved by the people of the two countries through common struggle and for consolidating peace and security in Asia. Therefore, the people of China and Korea are working resolutely towards this. The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, which came to Korea not long ago, has achieved great results in strengthening the friendship, solidarity, and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Korean people.

The editorial concludes by emphasizing that we, the Korean people, while sending a people's delegation to visit China, are determined to further strengthen the traditional friendship and solidarity with the fraternal Chinese people, and further consolidate and develop the economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, so as to successfully complete the task of restoring and developing the national economy after the war and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

The power of the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people, with the support of the world's peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, will make a brilliant contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the maintenance and consolidation of peace and security in the Far East.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”就朝鲜人民代表团访问我国发表社论
      【新华社平壤十三日电】“劳动新闻”十三日就朝鲜人民访华代表团启程赴我国访问发表题为“朝中两国人民友谊和团结的表示”的社论。
    社论首先写道：朝中两国人民在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下以鲜血结成的友谊团结，比泰山还高，比大海还深。朝中两国人民的友谊和团结正在日益巩固和发展着，这种高贵的精神将永远流在两国人民的血管里。
    朝鲜人民在任何时候，都不会忘记苏联人民解放和援助我们的伟大惠泽和朝中人民在共同斗争中所结成的友谊和团结，以及中国兄弟们继续给予我们的伟大的援助。
    社论指出：兄弟般的中国人民在我国恢复建设时期继续给予的莫大援助，与以苏联为首的其他兄弟国家人民的援助一起，是朝鲜人民恢复建设事业和争取祖国和平统一的斗争取得胜利的重要保证。因此，我们朝鲜人民深切地关心并努力进一步地加强与兄弟般的中国人民的友谊团结，不断地加强两国的经济及文化合作。这次派遣访华代表团就是由这种深切的关心和诚意出发的。访华代表团将参观中国人民的建设成就，传达朝鲜人民的斗争事迹，以进一步巩固和加强朝中两国人民的战斗友谊团结和文化交流。
    社论接着指出：朝中两国人民的友谊团结和互助精神的不断加强，是巩固和发展两国人民以共同斗争而取得的伟大胜利和巩固亚洲和平与安全的重要保证。因此，朝中两国人民为此正在进行着坚毅的工作。不久以前来到朝鲜的中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，在加强朝中两国人民的友谊团结和文化交流的事业上，已取得很大的成果。
    社论最后强调说，我们朝鲜人民在派遣人民代表团访问中国的同时，都决心进一步加强与兄弟般的中国人民的传统友谊团结，进一步巩固、发展两国的经济及文化合作关系，以便胜利地完成我国战后人民经济的恢复发展和祖国的和平统一的任务。
    朝中两国人民牢不可破的友谊团结的力量，将在以苏联为首的全世界和平民主阵营的支援下，对和平解决朝鲜问题和维护、巩固远东和平与安全的事业作出光辉的贡献。
