Xinhua News Agency: With spring arriving in Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units stationed on the Kaesong and Kumhwa frontlines are actively helping returning North Korean people settle down and resume production.

In the Daedoksan area, six kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, over 400 North Korean households have returned to this area, which is close to the northern edge of the demilitarized zone and was severely damaged by the enemy during the war. After returning to their homes, the North Korean government provided them with agricultural loans and large quantities of cloth. Volunteer Army units in the area also helped them repair many houses and build over 20 new ones. Many units also provided them with food and clothing they had saved. The Volunteer Army units are now planning to assist the local North Korean government in building a huge water barrier dam, which can irrigate hundreds of acres of paddy fields with the floodwaters it holds. The Volunteer Army stationed here also plans to require every commander and soldier to plant three trees during the tree-planting season to transform the barren mountains around Daedoksan into beautiful green forests. Now, one can see many North Korean people and Volunteer Army soldiers diligently filling bomb craters, building dikes, or reclaiming land in the fields that was abandoned during the war for the soon-to-return North Korean refugees.

On the Kumhwa frontline, in an area of over 100 square kilometers west from the vicinity of Triangle Hill (Sangganling) to the North Han River, the Volunteer Army is also actively helping the North Korean people rebuild their homes. These areas were recovered by our army during last year's summer counterattack. During the enemy's occupation, the US and Syngman Rhee invading forces drove out the North Korean residents of this vast area, many houses were burned to ashes, and some abandoned fields were covered with weeds over one meter deep. After the ceasefire, the local North Korean government and the Volunteer Army units guarding the area formed a command organization to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and actively helped residents carry out reconstruction work. In just eleven days, from March 3rd to 13th, the Volunteer Army units built 121 houses for the North Korean people in seven villages, including Kohori, Chestnut Village, and Chestnut Sand Village. Construction has also begun on the thirteen irrigation canals, totaling more than 11,000 meters in length, and a flood control dam more than 200 meters long, planned by the Volunteer Army units. Currently, the Volunteer Army units in this area are helping residents clear weeds from the fields and transport fertilizer to the fields, actively preparing for spring plowing and production.

    志愿军驻开城和金城前线部队
    积极帮助重返家园的朝鲜人民安家生产
    据新华社讯：朝鲜现在已经春暖花开了。守卫在开城和金城前线的中国人民志愿军部队正积极帮助重返家园的朝鲜人民安家生产。
    在板门店东北六公里的大德山一带，已经有四百多户朝鲜人民先后回到了这紧靠着非军事区北缘、在战争中遭到敌人严重破坏的地区。这些难民在重返家园后，朝鲜政府曾给他们发放了农业贷款和大批布匹，志愿军在该地的部队也帮助他们修补了许多房屋和盖了二十多座新房子。许多部队还将自己节约下来的粮食和衣物救济他们。现在志愿军部队正计划协助当地朝鲜政府修建一条巨大的挡水坝，这条挡水坝拦蓄的洪水可以灌溉稻田数百亩。驻守在这里的志愿军还计划在植树季节时，要求每个指挥员、战斗员都栽植三棵树，使大德山一带的秃山变成美丽的绿色山林。现在，人们可以看到在这一带的山岭和田野间，每天都有许多朝鲜人民和志愿军战士在辛勤地填平弹坑、修筑堤坝，或者为即将归来的朝鲜难民开垦在战争中荒芜的土地。
    在金城前线西起上甘岭附近、东至北汉江纵横一百多平方公里的土地上，志愿军帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的工作也正在积极进行。这些地区是我军在去年夏季反击战役中收复的。在敌人盘踞期间，美、李侵略军赶走了这片广大土地上的朝鲜居民，许多房屋被烧成灰烬，有些荒芜的田地里长着一人多深的野草。停战以后，当地的朝鲜政府和守卫在这个地区的志愿军部队组成了协助居民重建家园的指挥机构，积极帮助居民进行恢复建设工作。仅三月三日到十三日的十一天中，志愿军部队就为科湖里、栗洞、栗沙里等七个村庄的朝鲜人民修建了住宅一百二十一所。志愿军部队计划修建的十三条共长一万一千多公尺的水渠和一条长二百多公尺的防洪水坝也已开始动工。现在，这个地区的志愿军部队正帮助居民铲除田野里的荒草和向田间运送肥料，积极进行春耕生产的准备工作。
