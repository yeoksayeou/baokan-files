I am Ren Guodong, a recipient of the 1952 “National Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal” and Secretary of the CPC Horqin Right Wing Front Banner Committee of Heilongjiang Province.

I am honored to have received the 1952 "National Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal" from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. This should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of the Party and the higher-level People's Government. As for myself, I am just an ordinary member of the broad masses, and even if I have made a small contribution to the people, I should not be arrogant and complacent.

This year is the second year of our country's entry into the first five-year construction plan. We must maintain closer ties with the masses, promote the style of going deep among the masses and delving into work, and in the process of vigorously publicizing and implementing the general line, further consolidate, improve, and develop mutual aid and cooperation, extensively launch mass-based technical reform movements, and strive to harvest more grain to support national industrialization.

The favorable conditions for agricultural production increase in Horqin Right Wing Front Banner (i.e., Zhaoyuan County) in 1954 are: there have been two years of experience in mass-based technical reform movements. In particular, since last winter, the general line of the country during the transition period has been vigorously publicized, and the socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for expanding production among farmers have been greatly enhanced. However, we must also see the difficulties on the other hand, that is, the shortage of manure this year; due to excessive rain and land abandonment last year, the soil quality is poor this year, and we must do our best to prepare for spring plowing as early as possible. In the case of insufficient manure, in addition to vigorously opening up manure sources, we must also effectively use manure, pay attention to improving the quality of spring plowing, create labor-saving conditions for summer hoeing, and lay a good foundation for increasing production throughout the year.

    继续发扬深入群众钻研工作的作风
    一九五二年度“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者
    中共黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗旗委书记
    任国栋
    我荣幸地接受了中央人民政府农业部一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”。这首先应当感谢和归功于党和上级人民政府的正确领导。至于我个人只是广大群众行列中的普通一员，即或是对人民有一点贡献，也不应该骄傲自满。
    今年是我们国家进入第一个五年建设计划的第二年，我们要更加密切联系群众，发扬深入群众钻研工作的作风，在大力宣传和贯彻总路线的过程中，进一步巩固提高和发展互助合作，广泛开展群众性的技术改革运动，争取打更多的粮食，支援国家工业化。
    郭尔罗斯后旗（即肇源县）一九五四年农业增产的有利条件是：已有两年群众性的技术改革运动经验，特别是去年冬季以来，大张旗鼓地宣传了国家在过渡时期的总路线，农民的社会主义觉悟和扩大生产的积极性大大地提高了。但是，还必须看到另一方面的困难，就是今年粪肥不足；去年雨多地荒，今年的地底不好，必须尽全力早动手准备春耕。在粪肥不足的情况下，除大力开辟粪源外，还要有效地使用粪肥，注意提高春耕生产质量，为夏锄创造省工条件，给全年增产打下良好的基础。
