Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 28th: The Tenth Pan-American Conference will open in Caracas on March 1st. Participants will include the United States and nineteen other Latin American countries, excluding Costa Rica. Costa Rica refused to participate in the conference to protest its being held in Venezuela, which is under a dictatorship.

The conference agenda is divided into five items, including political and legal issues, economic and trade relations between participating countries of the "Organization of American States," and social and cultural issues. As can be seen from newspaper reports, the serious differences between the United States and most Latin American countries will be evident at the conference. The United States is attempting to intensify its attacks on democratic forces in Latin American countries under the guise of opposing "communism" and to legitimize U.S. imperialist interference in the internal affairs of these countries.

However, American newspapers admit that Latin American public opinion is largely unconcerned about the "communism" issue raised by the United States. "New York Times" reporter Brüé pointed out: "Many people believe that Latin American countries are mainly concerned about the economic issues that will be discussed at the conference." Associated Press reporter Elman believes: "In discussing the issue of communism in the Western Hemisphere, the positions of the U.S. delegation and the delegations of various Latin American countries will obviously be completely opposed."

According to Latin American sources, under the influence of the demands of the broad masses, even some government officials advocate that the Caracas conference should mainly focus on economic issues. Colombian Foreign Minister Sourdís recently stated that the Colombian delegation to the Caracas conference will pay special attention to economic issues. The Mexican newspaper "El Moderno," published on February 13th, carried a statement by Chilean Foreign Minister Ortiz, who also pointed out that the Caracas conference should mainly focus on economic issues. Latin American newspapers unanimously pointed out that no previous Pan-American conference has aroused such widespread controversy as this one, and conflicts between Latin American countries and the United States will inevitably first occur on economic issues.

Some Latin American newspapers have exposed the purpose of the United States in attending the Caracas conference. Uruguay's "El Debate" said: "North America's purpose in coming to Caracas is to protect the capital and profits of the 'United Fruit Company' and to have the foreign ministries of South American countries do business for this company." Uruguay's "Justicia" wrote: "The Caracas conference is a new link in the chain of Wall Street's monopoly capital enslaving Latin America, a new step for American billionaires to systematically encroach upon and plunder our wealth and to use our people as cannon fodder. The United States will advocate in Caracas the adoption of measures against democratic freedom, against the communist parties of the American continent, and against the working people, in order to achieve their goal of undermining the anti-imperialist liberation movement that has already unfolded on the American continent."

    第十届泛美会议在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯举行
    美报承认美国与拉丁美洲各国有严重分歧
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二月二十八日讯：第十届泛美会议将于三月一日在加拉加斯开幕。参加会议的将有美国及除开哥斯达黎加以外的其他十九个拉丁美洲国家。哥斯达黎加拒绝参加会议是为了表示抗议这个会议在实行独裁制度的委内瑞拉举行。
    会议议程共分五项，其中包括政治和法律问题、“美洲国家组织”参与国之间的经济及贸易关系问题以及社会和文化问题。由报纸的消息可以看出，美国与大多数拉丁美洲国家之间的严重分歧将在会上表现出来。美国企图以反对“共产主义”作幌子来加紧进攻拉丁美洲国家的民主力量，并使美帝国主义对这些国家内部事务的干涉合法化。
    但是，美国报纸承认，拉丁美洲舆论界大都对美国提出的关于“共产主义”的问题不甚关心。“纽约时报”记者布吕埃指出：“许多人认为拉丁美洲国家所关心的，主要是那些将在会上讨论的经济问题。”美联社记者埃尔曼认为：“在讨论西半球的共产主义问题时，美国代表团和拉丁美洲各国代表团的立场显然会是完全对立的。”
    据拉丁美洲的消息，在广大群众的要求影响下，甚至某些政府人士也主张加拉加斯会议主要应注意经济问题。哥伦比亚外交部部长索尔迪斯最近说过，哥伦比亚出席加拉加斯会议的代表团将特别注意经济问题。在墨西哥出版的“现代报”二月十三日刊载了智利外交部部长奥尔蒂斯的声明，他也指出，加拉加斯会议主要应注意经济问题。拉丁美洲报纸并一致指出，以前历届泛美会议都没有像这届会议一样地引起如此广泛的争论，拉丁美洲国家与美国之间不可避免的首先要在经济问题上发生冲突。
    一些拉丁美洲国家的报纸揭露了美国参加加拉加斯会议的目的。乌拉圭的“辩论报”说：“北美洲到加拉加斯来的目的是要保护‘联合果品公司’的资本和红利，要南美各国的外交部帮这个公司做生意。”乌拉圭的“乌斯蒂西亚报”写道：“加拉加斯会议是华尔街的垄断资本奴役拉丁美洲的锁链中的新的一环，是美国亿万富翁有系统地侵占和掠夺我们的财富，把我们的人民拿去做炮灰的一个新的步骤。美国将在加拉加斯主张采取措施，反对民主自由，反对美洲大陆各国的共产党，反对劳动人民，以达到他们破坏已在美洲大陆上展开的、反帝国主义解放运动的目的。”
