    The State-Owned Shanghai Qinfeng Paper Mill Should Not Allow Capitalists to Misappropriate Machinery
    Reader Yu Yinyu writes: There are serious chaotic phenomena in the work of the State-Owned Shanghai Qinfeng Paper Mill (hereinafter referred to as "the Paper Mill"), and some machines are even allowed to be arbitrarily misappropriated by capitalists.
    Zhang Qingcai, the capitalist of the privately-owned Xiangxing Machinery Factory, used to be a foreman in the Paper Mill before Liberation. After Liberation, the administrative leaders of the Paper Mill actually allowed him to enter and exit at will and allowed him to misappropriate machinery casually. In 1953, a lathe in the Paper Mill was borrowed by him several times, one of which lasted for three months, and it was not recovered until the property was checked at the end of the year. In 1952, the Paper Mill blindly added a drilling machine, which was never used. In August last year, Zhang Qingcai obtained the consent of the leaders of the Paper Mill and brought raw materials to the Qinfeng Paper Mill to produce private goods with this drilling machine free of charge. After the drilling machine was damaged, the Paper Mill did not ask him to compensate, but decided to dispose of it as stagnant material. It was not until the East China Office of the Central Ministry of Light Industry investigated that Zhang Qingcai was asked to compensate for the repair.
    The waste of machinery and raw materials in the Paper Mill due to poor storage is also very serious. When the factory formulated a basic construction plan in 1952, it applied for ten tons of bamboo-joint steel. Later, the plan changed, and this batch of national wealth was abandoned in the open-air warehouse. After a year of wind and rain, it has become scrap iron and was recently reported as scrap material. There is currently a paper machine and two diesel generators in the open-air warehouse, which are also about to become scrap iron due to long-term abandonment. The rags (paper making raw materials) stored in the factory are moldy due to poor storage, resulting in the factory's repeated production of defective products.
    The leadership of Qinfeng Paper Mill condones capitalists in disguised theft of state property and shows no love for the people's property. This kind of wrong behavior is not allowed by the state and the people. It is recommended that the East China Office of the Central Ministry of Light Industry conduct a thorough inspection of the factory.

### 国营上海勤丰造纸厂不应让资本家挪用机器

专栏：读者来信摘要

    国营上海勤丰造纸厂不应让资本家挪用机器
    读者余引玉来信：国营上海勤丰造纸厂（以下简称“造纸厂”）工作中有着严重的混乱现象，有些机器甚至让资本家任意挪用。
    私营祥兴机器厂资本家张庆才在解放前曾在造纸厂当工头，解放后造纸厂行政领导同志竟然还让他任意出入，并且允许他随便挪用机器。一九五三年内，造纸厂的一台车床被他借用数次，其中一次借出时间长达三个月，直至年底清查财产时才被追回。一九五二年造纸厂盲目添置钻床一台，从未使用。去年八月间，张庆才得到造纸厂领导方面的同意，就带了原料到勤丰造纸厂无代价地用这台钻床生产私人商品。钻床被损坏后，造纸厂也不要他赔偿，却决定当作呆滞物资处理。直到中央轻工业部华东办事处追查后，才要张庆才赔偿修理。
    造纸厂的机器和原材料，因保管不善而造成浪费的情况也很严重。在一九五二年厂里制订基本建设计划时，申请了竹节钢十吨。后来计划改变，这批国家财富就弃置在露天仓库。经过一年来的雨淋日晒，已经变成废铁，最近以呆滞物资报了废。露天仓库中目前尚有造纸机一具、柴油发电机两具，也因长期弃置而快要变成废铁。厂里所存的破布（造纸原料）因为保管得不好，霉烂很多，造成了该厂屡次出产废品。
    勤丰造纸厂领导方面纵容资本家变相盗窃国家财富，并且对人民财产毫不爱护，这种错误行为是国家和人民不能容许的。建议中央轻工业部华东办事处对该厂进行一次彻底检查。
