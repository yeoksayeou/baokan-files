    Strengthen the Anti-Espionage and Confidentiality Work of State Organs and Enterprise Departments
    The recent cracking of the "Qingfeng Society" counter-revolutionary special agent organization jointly by the People's Public Security Organs of Guangdong Province, Hunan Province, and Guangzhou City indicates that during the historical period of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, international imperialists and their running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, will inevitably intensify their sabotage by various means. In addition to directly dispatching special agents and spies from outside to infiltrate our country to carry out sabotage, they will certainly seek out reactionary elements from the classes that have been overthrown by the people and die-hard counter-revolutionary elements who have escaped the net within our country to undermine our construction undertakings. Therefore, we must maintain revolutionary vigilance at all times and be ready to smash all sabotage activities of the enemy, and we must not be negligent in any way.
    This case also sharply reminds us that undermining our economic construction is one of the most important goals of counter-revolutionary sabotage now and in the future. The principal culprit in this case, Luo Ding'an, had infiltrated the Yuebei Qujiang No. 16 Mine and the Shaoguan City Liputou Telecommunications Section and other factories, mines, and basic construction sites. He cunningly took advantage of the lack of revolutionary vigilance and political paralysis of some of our cadres, using the No. 16 Mine as a base for counter-revolutionary activities for a long time, and attempted to establish intelligence strongholds along the Yuehan Railway line, turning the entire Yuehan Railway into an enemy intelligence line, to steal our military and economic construction intelligence, blow up railway bridges, and burn down warehouses. Although these conspiracy plans of the enemy have been smashed by us, this fact deserves the serious vigilance of our factories, mines, basic construction, and other departments, so as to attach importance to and strengthen economic security work, improve the security organizations of economic construction departments, strengthen the education and leadership of mass anti-espionage and confidentiality organizations in economic construction departments, and strictly guard against and pay attention to the sabotage activities of some counter-revolutionary elements who may have or have already infiltrated economic construction departments. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth progress of our national economic construction.
    In addition, the cracking of this case also reminds us that the enemy is trying every means to penetrate our vital departments—the leading organs of military and political departments—to carry out long-term lurking activities in order to steal our military, economic, and political intelligence, and to carry out other sabotage activities. The principal culprit in the case, Luo Ding'an, ordered the special agents in the case, Yang Sufen, Huang Lijuan, Chen Zuying, etc., to infiltrate our confidential organs as nannies and odd-job workers under the guise of unemployed workers. These facts show that some of our organs, due to the various social reform movements in recent years, especially the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, have begun to breed complacency and underestimation of the enemy, gradually weakening political vigilance and relaxing the anti-espionage and security work of the organs. In recent years, many serious incidents of losing and leaking secrets have occurred in many organs and departments, and even incidents of being infiltrated by counter-revolutionary elements who set fires and explosions have occurred, which are also the evil consequences of this thought of underestimating the enemy and complacency. Therefore, strengthening the anti-espionage and confidentiality work of the leading organs of military, political, and economic departments, and blocking the gaps in the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements is a political task that brooks no delay for these departments at present.

    加强国家机关和企业部门的防奸保密工作
    最近广东省、湖南省、广州市的人民公安机关共同破获的反革命特务组织“青锋社”案指明：在我国进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的历史时期中，国际帝国主义者及其走狗蒋匪帮必然要加紧采取各种办法进行破坏。他们除直接从外面派遣特务间谍分子潜入我国境内进行破坏外，势必还会在我国境内物色那些已被人民打倒了的阶级中的反动分子和漏网的坚决反革命分子，来破坏我们的建设事业。因此，我们必须时刻保持革命的警惕，随时准备粉碎敌人的一切破坏活动，而不能有任何麻痹大意。
    这件案件还尖锐地提醒我们：破坏我国经济建设，是目前也是今后反革命破坏的最重要目标之一。这一案件中的主犯罗定安即曾先后混入我粤北曲江一六矿山和韶关市黎铺头电务段等厂矿和基本建设工地，狡猾地利用了我某些干部革命警惕性不高和政治麻痹的空子，长期以一六矿山作为反革命活动的基地，并企图沿粤汉铁路线建立情报据点，将粤汉铁路全线作为敌人的情报干线，来偷窃我军事、经济建设情报，爆破铁路桥梁，烧毁仓库。敌人这些阴谋计划虽然被我们粉碎了，但这件事实却值得引起我们工厂、矿山、基本建设等部门的严重警惕，从而重视和加强经济保卫工作，健全经济建设部门的保卫组织，加强对经济建设部门群众防奸保密组织的教育和领导，严密警戒和注意一些可能和已经混入经济建设部门中的反革命分子的破坏活动。只有这样，才能确保我们国家经济建设事业的顺利进行。
    另外，这个案件的破获还提醒我们：敌人正想尽一切办法打进我们的要害部门——军、政部门的领导机关，进行长期潜伏活动，以盗窃我军事、经济和政治情报，及进行其他破坏活动。该案主犯罗定安即曾命令该案特务分子杨素芬、黄丽娟、陈祖英等以失业工人身份，分别打入了我机要机关充当保姆和勤杂人员。这些事实说明：我们有些机关由于近年来经过各项社会改革运动，特别是镇压反革命运动，已经开始滋长着麻痹大意现象和轻敌思想，逐渐削弱了政治警惕，放松了机关防奸保卫工作。近年来有不少机关部门发生严重的失密和泄密事件，甚至有的发生了被反革命分子混进去纵火爆破等事件，也是这种轻敌麻痹思想所造成的恶果。因此，加强军、政、经济部门领导机关的防奸保密工作，堵塞反革命分子破坏活动的空隙，是目前这些部门刻不容缓的政治任务。
