    While people all over the world eagerly anticipate seeking the restoration of peace in Indochina through the Geneva Conference, the U.S. warmongering clique is intensifying a series of conspiracies in Washington and Paris to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina, further interfere in the Indochina War, seize war command from France, and attempt to turn the Indochina War into another Korean War.

    In Paris, the cry of "End the Indochina War immediately" is rising unprecedentedly. However, U.S. Ambassador to France Dillon recently held three consecutive meetings with French Foreign Minister Bidault in a week, pressuring France to continue this difficult and desperate war instead of negotiating peace. Dillon brazenly threatened the French government, saying that if peace is negotiated in the spirit of international consultation, "it would be tantamount to surrender and would cause serious repercussions in the United States." He acted like a master, stating that according to the U.S.-France agreement, the United States "has paid more than 75 percent of the cost of the Indochina War," and "Washington will be unwilling to accept a peace that violates the spirit of the agreement without objection" (United Press).

    Since they are unwilling to see the restoration of peace in Indochina, the masters of Wall Street, of course, must first drive the French to continue this bloody war in Indochina. The key figure of the U.S. warmongering clique, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, recently said publicly in an interview with a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report": "We are supplying the French with military equipment and technical assistance. Our purpose in doing so is to hope that the French and the Federal State can carry out more and more military operations." He also nakedly explained an important aggressive purpose of the U.S. interference in the Indochina War: The United States must firmly maintain and promote its colonial rule over Southeast Asia in order to control and arbitrarily plunder the region's abundant resources and vast markets. He stated that if Indochina is peaceful and the people of Indochina are independent, "it would endanger the entire Southeast Asia... the important raw materials and markets of this vast region would no longer be available to us for trade."

    However, in the eyes of the U.S. warmongering clique, the French government is far from being active enough in carrying out the task of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Defense is actively planning for the United States to "take over" the Indochina War. According to the U.S. "Newsweek" published on March 8, the U.S. Department of Defense is "increasingly annoyed" with the French government's lackluster attitude toward the Indochina War. Therefore, "Pentagon chiefs are putting strong pressure on France to accelerate the training of Indochinese troops and to more clearly guarantee the freedom of the Indochinese (i.e., force France to allow the Indochinese puppets to completely break away from the French Union)." This is actually to let the United States directly control the puppet regime and puppet army of Indochina. "Newsweek" reported: "Among the highest-level officials in the United States, a possible solution to the Indochina problem is being discussed: placing the U.S. diplomatic and military missions in Indochina under the command of one person, who must have sufficient prestige to push the French to take more vigorous action and accept our views more readily." The magazine also revealed that the U.S. government is considering sending Van Fleet to carry out the task of seizing command of the Indochina War from the French in the next step. What kind of person is Van Fleet? Everyone is very familiar with him: He is a notorious executioner whose hands are stained with the blood of the Greek and Korean people, and he has experience in squeezing the British out of Greece.

    As an important step in seizing command of the war, the U.S. government has appointed O'Daniel, former commander of the U.S. First Corps in the Korean War and commander of the U.S. Pacific Army, as the head of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina. Washington has recently been intensifying pressure on Paris, forcing it to hand over the power to train and control the Indochinese puppet army to O'Daniel. It is said that the U.S. Department of Defense has made such a "proposal" to the French government: the United States should send a large military mission consisting of one thousand people to Indochina to train the puppet army. Needless to say, the actual task of this military mission is to take over command of the war from the French. Although France has repeatedly expressed its rejection of this "proposal" from the United States, and the Pentagon is well aware that France is "very unhappy with the U.S. proposal to send a training group," and the "strong pressure" Washington has placed on Paris has made "U.S.-French relations quite tense," the U.S. Department of Defense has not taken the attitude of its Parisian partner into account, and it still unswervingly insists that its proposal "remains valid." It is revealed that the first thing O'Daniel is scheduled to do after arriving in Indochina in early April is to "discuss" this "proposal" face-to-face with French Commander-in-Chief of the invading forces in Indochina, Navarre. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will directly force French Foreign Minister Bidault to accept this "proposal" when he goes to Paris in April to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting.

    At the same time, the U.S. warmongering clique is moving step by step towards the path of directly participating in the Indochina War. U.S. President Eisenhower has recently hinted twice at press conferences that the United States wants to formally participate in the war. At a press conference on March 10, when a reporter asked what the United States would do if U.S. Air Force personnel in Indochina were captured or killed, Eisenhower said: "Our country (referring to the United States) will not be involved in the war without Congress exercising its constitutional right to declare war." The meaning is that the U.S. government may use the killing of U.S. Air Force personnel currently participating in the Indochina War as an excuse to obtain approval from the U.S. Congress to formally participate in the Indochina War. At a press conference on the 17th, Eisenhower further said: Whether or not a declaration of war should be passed by Congress "cannot be generalized." He said, "It is impossible to predict exactly what will happen in the future." This expression of the U.S. warmongering clique's desire to formally participate in the Indochina War was made more blatant in Radford's mouth. According to the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published on March 5, the magazine reporter asked Radford the following question: "To what extent are we prepared to deal with another 'Korean War' (... for example, in Indochina)?" Radford replied: "This is a contingency that we must be prepared for."

    However, the series of dangerous measures and blindly adventurous intentions taken by the U.S. warmongering clique have not only failed to intimidate anyone, but have aroused great dissatisfaction among the American people. This sentiment is reflected in the U.S. Congress. U.S. Democratic Congressman Smith said on the 15th, referring to Eisenhower's remarks on the 10th: "In view of the actions taken by the (U.S. government) in Indochina to date, our people are currently asking us whether we may be drawn into the war, because we have already expanded military assistance there, and we have recently sent military aircraft and personnel there." He said: "The whole country is very concerned about our policy, fearing that it may lead to another undeclared war." Smith warned: "If we have not yet participated in the Indochina War, then we are very dangerously close to this war, whether declared or not."

    People can see very clearly: The U.S. warmongering clique, which has already suffered heavy losses in the war of aggression against Korea, has not learned enough lessons from that tragic failure. People all over the world are closely watching the adventurous activities of the U.S. warmongering clique. The U.S. warmongering clique will be severely judged by world public opinion.

### 美国好战集团阻挠在印度支那恢复和平

    美国好战集团阻挠在印度支那恢复和平
    正当全世界人民热切期待通过日内瓦会议谋求恢复印度支那和平的时候，美国好战集团却在华盛顿和巴黎加紧进行一系列的阴谋活动，阻挠在印度支那恢复和平，进一步干涉印度支那战争，从法国手中夺取战争指挥权，并企图把印度支那战争变为另一场朝鲜战争。
    在巴黎，“立刻结束印度支那战争”的呼声正在空前高涨。但是，美国驻法大使狄龙最近却在一星期中接连和法国外交部长皮杜尔进行了三次会谈，压迫法国把这场艰难的、绝望的战争继续打下去，而不要谈判和平。狄龙蛮横地恫吓法国政府说：如果按照国际协商的精神谈判和平，“就是投降，就会在美国引起严重影响。”他俨然以主子的身份表示：按照美法间的协议，美国“已经付出了印度支那战争百分之七十五以上的费用”，“华盛顿将不愿意无异议地接受违反协议精神的和平”（合众社）。
    既然不愿意看到在印度支那恢复和平，华尔街的主人们首先要做的，当然就是驱使法国人在印度支那继续进行这场流血战争。美国好战集团的重要头目、美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福最近在对“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志记者谈话时公开地说：“我们正在供给法国人以军事装备和技术援助。我们这样做的目的，是希望法国人和联邦国家能够进行越来越多的军事行动。”他并且赤裸裸地说明了美国干涉印度支那战争的一个重要侵略目的：美国要坚决保持并推行对东南亚的殖民统治，以便控制并任意掠夺这个地区的丰富资源和广大的市场。他表示：如果印度支那和平了，印度支那人民独立了，“就会危及整个东南亚，……这一广大地区的重要原料和市场就不会再供给我们和让我们做买卖了。”
    但是，在美国好战集团看起来，法国政府在执行替美国火中取栗的任务中，还远不够积极。因此，美国国防部正在积极策划由美国“接管”印度支那战争。据三月八日出版的美国“新闻周刊”说：美国国防部对于法国政府对印度支那战争的没精打采的态度，“愈来愈感到厌烦”。因此，“五角大楼的头子们正在对法国施以强大压力，叫它加速训练印度支那军队，并且更明白地保证印度支那人的自由（按即强迫法国允许印度支那的傀儡完全脱离法兰西联邦）”。这实际上就是要法国让美国来直接控制印度支那的傀儡政权和傀儡军队。“新闻周刊”报道说：“在美国的最高级官员中间，正在讨论一个解决印度支那问题的可能的办法：把美国驻在印度支那的外交和军事使团置于一个人的指挥之下，这个人要有足够的威信来推动法国人采取更有力的行动，使他们更多地接受我们的看法。”该刊并透露：美国政府正考虑在下一步派遣范佛里特去执行这个从法国人手中夺取印度支那战争指挥权的任务。范佛里特是一个什么样的人呢？大家都很熟悉：他是双手沾满了希腊人民和朝鲜人民的鲜血的恶名昭彰的刽子手，而且有着从希腊排挤掉英国人的惯熟的经验。
    作为夺取战争指挥权的一个重要步骤，美国政府已经任命前侵朝美军第一兵团司令、美国太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔继任美国驻印度支那“军事援助顾问团”团长。华盛顿最近正在加紧对巴黎施加压力，强迫它将训练和控制印度支那傀儡军队的权力交给奥丹尼尔。据说：美国国防部已经向法国政府提出这样一个“建议”：由美国派遣一个由一千人组成的庞大军事使团，到印度支那去训练傀儡军队。不用说，这个军事使团的实际任务，就是要从法国人手中接收战争指挥权。虽然法国已经一再表示拒绝美国的这项“建议”，五角大楼也很清楚地了解：法国“对美国建议派遣训练团是很不痛快的”，而华盛顿对巴黎所加的“强大压力”已使
  “美法关系颇为紧张”，但是，美国国防部并没有把它的巴黎伙伴的态度放在眼里，它还是毫不动摇地坚持它的这项建议“仍然有效”。据透露：奥丹尼尔预定在四月初到印度支那后的第一件事情，就是要和法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔当面“商谈”这个
  “建议”。同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯在四月间去巴黎出席北大西洋集团会议时，也将直接强迫法国外交部长皮杜尔接受这个“建议”。
    与此同时，美国好战集团正在一步紧一步地走向直接参加印度支那战争的道路。美国总统艾森豪威尔最近曾接连两次在记者招待会上暗示美国想正式参战。在三月十日的记者招待会上，当一个记者问如果现在印度支那的美国空军人员被俘或被打死，美国将怎么办时，艾森豪威尔说：“不经国会行使其宪法权利宣战，我国（指美国）不会卷入战争。”意思就是：美国政府可能利用现在印度支那参战的美国空军人员被打死作为借口，来取得美国国会的批准，正式参加印度支那战争。在十七日的记者招待会上，艾森豪威尔又进一步说：宣战是否要通过国会，“不能一概而论”。他说：“不能确切地预言将来终于会发生什么事情”。美国好战集团这种要正式参加印度支那战争的表示，在雷德福的嘴里说得更加露骨。据三月五日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载：该刊记者向雷德福提出下面这样一个问题：“我们对于应付另一次
  ‘朝鲜战争’（……譬如说在印度支那）的准备，到了什么程度了？”雷德福回答说：“这是一种我们必须对之有所准备的意外事件。”
    但是，美国好战集团所采取的一系列危险措施和盲目冒险的意图，不仅没有恫吓着什么人，反而引起了美国人民的很大不满。这种情绪在美国国会中反映出来。美国民主党议员史密斯十五日在谈到艾森豪威尔十日的谈话时说：“鉴于（美国政府）迄今在印度支那所采取的行动，我们的人民目前正在询问我们是否可能卷入战争，因为我们已经在那里扩大了军事援助，我们最近并已经派了军用飞机和人员到那里去。”他说：“全国非常关怀我们的政策，怕它可能会导致另一个不宣而战的战争。”史密斯并警告说：“如果我们还没有参加印度支那战争的话，那么，我们已经是很危险地接近这个战争了，不管宣战与否。”
    人们可以看得很清楚：已经在侵朝战争中碰得头破血流的美国好战集团，并没有从那次悲惨的失败里取得足够的教训。全世界人民都在密切地注视着美国好战集团的冒险活动。美国好战集团将受到世界公正舆论的严正审判。（新华社）
