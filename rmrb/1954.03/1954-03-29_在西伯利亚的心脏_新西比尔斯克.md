    In the Heart of Siberia—Novosibirsk
    By Sai Zhelkov, Soviet Union
    …Early morning, the first pedestrians are hurrying along the streets of this big city. Comfortable buses speed past, and gorgeous trams clang their bells as they move forward. The radio broadcasts the lively and cheerful melody of morning exercise music. The daily labor of Novosibirsk begins.

    After the sun rises from the east, everything on the city's main thoroughfare—Red Avenue—becomes active. This avenue stretches like a wide ribbon from the pine forest in the north to the banks of the Ob River in the south. Tall and beautiful buildings line both sides of the avenue. In the city center, the silver-white dome of the opera house can be seen. No matter where you look, you are presented with magnificent buildings—tall residences, office buildings, clubs, schools, specialized secondary schools, and further out, beyond the city, one factory after another.

    Creator of Giant Lathes
    The Heavy Machine Tool and Hydraulic Press Manufacturing Plant is the pride of Novosibirsk. Here, people call it the "factory of factories." The giant lathes manufactured by the workers in this plant can replace more than ten medium-sized lathes.

    Let's go to the assembly workshop and take a look. The work team led by fitter Tatarnikov is assembling a vertical lathe. The size of this lathe can be inferred from the following figure: some of the parts processed on it weigh up to one hundred and fifty tons. Two such lathes have already been manufactured and installed in factories in Leningrad and Kharkov.

    In another workshop, a longitudinal planer has just been installed. The fitters, electricians, and engineers testing the machine look like little dolls compared to this machine.

    The products of the machine-building workers of Novosibirsk are transported to various cities in the Soviet Union to supply various peaceful construction projects. These include construction machinery and railway machinery for the great construction projects of the Volga and Dnieper Rivers, as well as metal supports and other machines for high-pressure engines.

    Specialized Schools and Academy of Sciences Branch
    Novosibirsk is a city of specialized universities and specialized secondary schools. When we visited one of them—the Kuibyshev Institute of Civil Engineering—the lecture hall was full of people. The students were attentively listening to Mikhailov, a Master of Technical Sciences, lecture on gypsum raw materials from Siberian minerals. This Institute of Civil Engineering trains various types of engineering experts, such as industrial and civil construction engineers, water conservancy and waterway construction engineers, as well as hydroelectric power station construction engineers and architects. The school has been established for fifty years. For fifty years, it has trained thousands of experts for various sectors of the national economy. Some of them are now working in Blagoveshchensk, some are working on the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station construction site, and others are working in Moscow and other cities.

    While the Second World War was raging fiercely, the West Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was established in Novosibirsk. This is the scientific center of Siberia. In the branch's Institute of Mineral Geology, Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, and Institute of Transportation and Power, huge research work on the nature and economy of West Siberia is now being carried out to most effectively develop its resources. The branch's Institute of Animal Husbandry has also achieved great scientific achievements. On the day we went to Novosibirsk, Alexander Ovsyannikov, the Director of the Institute of Animal Husbandry and winner of the Stalin Prize, was giving a speech entitled "The Transformation of the Barabinsk Lowland and the Prospects for Its Animal Husbandry Development" in the broadcasting room of the city broadcasting committee. He said: "The vast Barabinsk Lowland, thanks to the work of Soviet scientists, is becoming a powerful feed base. This will further develop animal husbandry in Siberia. The various tasks we are carrying out in the Barabinsk Lowland are promoting the increase in the production of cattle and sheep in collective farms, and improving forestry, fishery, and peat extraction."

    At the Railway Station
    Novosibirsk Station is the largest and most beautiful station on the Siberian Railway.

    Across the plains and through vast forests, heavy freight trains and brand-new, gleaming express passenger trains speed towards Novosibirsk from all directions. Just stay in the station building for an hour or two, and you can see travelers from major cities across the country.

    There are more than a hundred rooms of various kinds in the station: waiting rooms, ticket offices, a hotel (with thirty-eight fully equipped rooms), passenger lounges, and lounges for women with children. In the women's lounge, there are also entertainment rooms and rest rooms specially set up for children, as well as medical rooms with nurses and doctors to specially care for the children. In addition, there are thirty-seven snack bars and a restaurant in the railway station.

    Now, the train is arriving at the station. Passengers are coming out of the train to the station square, where dozens of taxis are waiting for them. Among the newly arrived passengers, we can see Dr. Cherepanov and his wife and daughter. Cherepanov has come to Novosibirsk from Voronezh to settle down. He will work in the municipal clinic, and comrades from the sanatorium are welcoming him at the station. Before he arrived, an apartment in a new building on Zhdanov Street had already been prepared for him and his family.

    Among a group of young people over there, we can see graduates from Moscow State University. One of the girls is Lyudmila Kechakova, who will work as a process technician in a factory.

    Many people came to Novosibirsk on this day. Some came to live and work in this city, while others came to meet their relatives and friends.

    Cultural Entertainment and Recreation
    The workday is over. The residents of Novosibirsk are all going home to eat. After that, they will rest, go to the theater, the cinema, or the club.

    However, not all citizens work on this day; some people rest on this day. They spent this day outside the city, strolling in the scenic pine forests, going to the sports field, or going to the "Day Rest Home" in Berdsk, a suburb of Novosibirsk. In Berdsk, there are several sanatoriums and rest homes belonging to river transport workers, machine-building workers, and universities.

    In the evening, all the libraries, reading rooms, and cinemas in Novosibirsk are crowded with people.

    At this time, Mussorgsky's opera "Boris Godunov" is being staged at the Opera and Ballet Theater. This magnificent theater—the main hall, boxes, and galleries—is filled with audience members. Boris in the play is played by Arganov, a Siberian genius singer and Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This actor, who has been engaged in stage art for twenty-five years, is deeply welcomed and loved by the audience.

    The Novosibirsk Theater is not only the largest theater in Siberia, but also one of the best in many other large cities.

    Night. The wide streets of the city have become quiet again. The lights in most of the windows have been turned off. However, trucks have already driven out of various garages to transport products and goods to the shops, and printing houses are printing the local morning newspaper... Novosibirsk has not yet said goodbye to yesterday, but is entering a new day—another day full of creative and peaceful labor in a large Soviet city is beginning. (Attached photo)

    在西伯利亚的心脏—新西比尔斯克
    苏联　塞·热尔科夫
    ……清晨，在这个大城市的街道上已经有第一批行人在匆忙赶路了。一辆辆舒适的公共汽车疾驰而过，华丽的电车也叮叮当当地响着铃向前行驶。广播器里传来了早操进行曲的活泼愉快的旋律。新西比尔斯克日常劳动的一天开始了。
    太阳从东方升起以后，本城的一条主要干路——红色大街上的一切都活跃起来了。这条大街自北至南像一道宽广的带子似地从松林一直伸展到鄂毕河畔。大街两旁高耸着整齐美观的建筑物。在城市的中心看得见歌剧院的银白色的圆屋顶。不管你向那儿眺望，在你眼前到处都呈现着巍峨的建筑物——高大的住宅、办公大厦、俱乐部、学校、专科学校，再下去，在城外，便是一个个的工厂。
    巨大车床的创造者
    重型车床与水压机制造厂是新西比尔斯克的骄傲。在这里，人们管它叫做“工厂的工厂”。这个厂里的工人所制造出来的巨大车床，可以用来替代十个以上的中型车床。
    让我们到装配车间去看一看吧。由钳工塔塔尔尼科夫领导的工作小组，正在装配一座立式车床。这座车床的大小，只要从下面这一数字就可以推断出来了：在它上面加工的部件，有的重量达一百五十吨。现在已经制造了两座这样的车床，并已安装在列宁格勒和哈尔科夫的工厂里了。
    在另外一个车间里，刚刚装置好了一座纵式刨床。正在那里试车的钳工、电气工人和工程师们，和这座机器比较起来，简直就像小娃娃一样。
    新西比尔斯克的机器制造工人们的产品，运往苏联各个城市里去，供给各项和平建设事业之用，这里面有供给伏尔加河和第聂伯河的伟大建筑工程之用的建筑机器和铁路机器，也有高压联动机的金属支座和别的机器。
    专科学校和科学院分院
    新西比尔斯克是一个专科大学和专科中学的城市，当我们到其中的一所——古比雪夫建筑工程学院去参观的时候，大讲堂里正坐满了人。学生们正在专心地听着技术科学硕士米哈依洛夫关于西伯利亚矿藏的石膏原料的演讲。这个建筑工程学院训练着各种不同的工程专家，如工业和民用建筑工程师、水利和河道建筑工程师以及水电站的建筑工程师和建筑学家等等。该校已成立了五十年了。五十年来，它已经为国民经济各部门培养出了几千个专家。现在他们有的在伯力工作，有的在古比雪夫水电站建筑工地上工作，也有在莫斯科和其他城市里工作的。
    正当第二次世界大战激烈进行的时候，苏联科学院西西伯利亚分院在新西比尔斯克成立了。这是西伯利亚的科学中心。在分院的矿物地质研究院、化学冶金研究院和运输动力研究院中，现在正进行着关于西西伯利亚的自然和经济的巨大的研究工作，以便最有效地开发它的富源。分院的畜牧科学研究院也获得了巨大的科学成就。在我们到新西比尔斯克去的那一天，畜牧研究院院长、斯大林奖金获得者亚力山大·奥弗西杨尼科夫正在市广播委员会的广播室里作题为“巴拉宾斯克低地的改造及其畜牧业发展的前途”的演讲。他说：“广大的巴拉宾斯克低地，由于苏联科学家们的工作，正成为有力的饲料基地。这将使西伯利亚的畜牧业更为发展。我们在巴拉宾斯克低地所进行的各项工作，促进着集体农庄的牛、羊产量的增加，改进着林业、渔业和泥炭的采掘。”
    在火车站上
    新西比尔斯克车站是西伯利亚铁路干线上的最大和最漂亮的一个车站。
    越过平原，穿过巨大的森林，载着货物的重型火车和崭新闪亮的特快客车，从四面八方向新西比尔斯克疾驰而来。只要在车站大厦内停留那么个把钟头，就可以看到从全国各大城市前来的旅客。
    站内有一百间以上的各式各样的房间：候车室、售票室、一个旅馆（内有三十八间各项设备俱全的房间）、旅客休息室和携带小孩的妇女休息室。在妇女休息室里还专为孩童辟设了娱乐室和休息室以及专门看护小孩的有护士和医生的医药室。此外，在火车站里，还有三十七家点心铺和一家饭店。
    现在，火车进站了。旅客们纷纷从车内出来到车站广场上，那里正有几十辆出差汽车在等候他们。在刚抵达的旅客中我们可以看到契列巴诺夫医生和他的太太与女儿。契列巴诺夫是从沃龙涅什到新西比尔斯克来定居的。他将在市立诊疗院中工作，疗养院的同志们正在站上欢迎着他。而在他未到达之前，这里就已经为他和他的家庭在日丹诺夫街的一幢新房子里准备好寓所了。
    在那边一群青年人中间，我们可以看到国立莫斯科大学的毕业生。其中有一位姑娘是柳德米拉·凯查科娃，她将要在一所工厂里当工艺技师。
    这一天到新西比尔斯克来的人非常多。有的是到这个城市里来居住和劳动的，也有是来会见他们的亲戚和朋友的。
    文化娱乐和休息
    劳动的一天结束了。新西比尔斯克的居民们都回家吃饭去了。这以后他们就要休息，上剧院、电影院或者俱乐部去。
    可是，并不是所有的市民都在这天工作，也有人是在这天休息的。他们在城外度过了这一天，在风景幽美的松树林里散步，到运动场去，或到新西比尔斯克的郊区——勃德斯克的“一日休养所”去。在勃德斯克有好几所疗养院和分属于河运工人、机器制造工人与高等学校的休养所。
    一到晚上，新西比尔斯克市内所有的图书馆、阅览室和电影院都挤满了人。
    这时，歌舞剧院的舞台上在上演着穆索尔斯基的歌剧“波里斯·戈都诺夫”。这座壮丽的剧院里——正厅、包厢、楼座里都坐满了观众。剧中波里斯一角由西伯利亚的天才歌唱家、俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋演员阿尔加诺夫饰演。这位从事舞台艺术工作已达二十五年之久的演员深得观众的欢迎和热爱。
    新西比尔斯克剧院不但是西伯利亚最大的一个剧院，即在其他许多大城市的剧院里它也是数一数二的。
    夜晚。城内的宽广的街道上又复宁静了下来。大部分的窗子里灯火都已熄灭了。可是，从各个汽车房里已经有卡车开出来载运产品和货物到铺子里去，印刷所也在印刷本地的晨报了……新西比尔斯克还没有和昨天道别，却又在进入新的一天了——苏联大城市的又一个充满了创造性的和平劳动的日子开始了。（附图片）
