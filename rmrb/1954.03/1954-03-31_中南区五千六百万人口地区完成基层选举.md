Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 30th: Basic-level election work in the Central-South China region is progressing rapidly. As of now, the entire region has victoriously completed elections in more than 24,280 basic-level units, covering approximately 56.2 million people. Among them, Jiangxi Province and the cities of Wuhan and Guangzhou have all concluded their elections, and Xiangnan District in Hunan Province and the Huanggang and Xiaogan Special Districts in Hubei Province have also basically completed their elections. Furthermore, seven counties and cities in Jiangxi Province have convened their first People's Congresses. Currently, over 26,800 basic-level units in the region are on the verge of completing their election work. Election work is being rolled out in another 23,900 basic-level units.

After the commencement of the basic-level election work in the Central-South China region, all localities closely integrated it with the general line, launching extensive popular election propaganda activities. Many townships and towns in Guangdong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces mobilized a large number of propagandists, using methods such as reports, seminars, visits, and recollection comparisons to explain the significance of popular elections to voters. Many areas also used local people's favorite folk art forms such as mountain songs and operas to promote the elections to voters. In Tonggu, Yongxiu, Dongxiang, Poyang and other counties in Jiangxi Province, the popular election workers and activists went deep into the fields to lead farmers in production while carrying out popular election propaganda. Yang Jintang, a poor peasant from Mengzhuang Township, Zhongmu County, Henan Province, said: Chairman Mao has handed the seal of power to us; we must manage our household well. In many areas, after the popular election work teams publicized the significance of the elections, mutual aid groups spontaneously held meetings to discuss election work, actively engaging in production during the day and enthusiastically participating in popular election activities in the evening.

During the popular election movement, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in the Central-South China region for participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and production has generally increased. Farmers in the first district of Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, quickly completed the task of repairing dikes with 320,000 cubic meters of earth, repaired sixteen ponds, and intensely carried out agricultural activities such as weeding rapeseed during the popular election movement. In Qujiang County, Guangdong Province, farmers from seventeen townships automatically organized 585 mutual aid groups while completing population surveys and voter registration.

With the extensive unfolding of the popular election movement, election committees in various localities have paid attention to strengthening leadership over the election work. The four provinces of Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong have successively dispatched work groups to conduct in-depth inspections of the popular election work in order to discover and solve problems and ensure the smooth progress of the election work.

    中南区五千六百万人口地区完成基层选举
    【新华社武汉三十日电】中南区基层选举工作进展很快。截至目前止，全区已在二万四千二百八十多个基层单位、约五千六百二十余万人口的地区胜利完成。其中江西省和武汉、广州两市已全部结束，湖南省湘南区和湖北省黄冈、孝感两专区也已基本结束。江西省并有七个县、市召开了首次人民代表大会。目前，全区二万六千八百多个基层单位也即将完成选举工作。其他二万三千九百多个基层单位正在陆续展开。
    中南区基层选举工作展开后，各地便密切结合总路线展开了广泛的普选宣传活动。广东、河南、湖北、江西等省许多乡、镇，都动员了大批宣传员，通过报告、座谈、访问、回忆对比等方式，向选民说明普选的意义。很多地区并运用当地群众最喜爱的山歌、戏曲等民间文艺形式向选民进行宣传。江西省铜鼓、永修、东乡、鄱阳等县的普选工作人员和积极分子，并深入田间一面领导农民生产，一面展开普选宣传。河南省中牟县孟庄乡贫农杨金堂说：毛主席把印把子交给咱，咱可要把家当好。许多地区在普选工作队宣传普选意义后，互助组自动开会讨论选举工作，白天积极生产，晚上踊跃参加普选活动。
    在普选运动中，中南区广大农民参加互助合作运动和生产的积极性普遍提高了。江西省临川县第一区的农民，在普选运动中很快完成了三十二万土方的修堤任务，修好了十六口水塘，并紧张地展开了锄油菜等农事活动。广东省曲江县十七个乡的农民在完成人口调查，选民登记的同时，自动组织了五百八十五个互助组。
    随着普选运动的广泛展开，各地选举委员会都注意加强对选举工作的领导。河南、湖南、湖北、广东四省已先后派出了工作组，深入检查普选工作，以便发现和解决问题，保证选举工作的顺利进行。
