Pingyao County's Daobei Township Changes Its Backward Appearance Through General Election

Daobei Township in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, has changed its backward appearance after the grassroots election. Daobei Township is composed of Daobei and Houguo villages, with 969 households. The land is flat and agricultural products are abundant. Although various political movements have been carried out since liberation, especially after the establishment of the township, various grassroots organizations have been established, but they are very unsound. The door of the township people's government is often closed, the Party's leadership is weak, and some Party members and Youth League members neglect politics, are not active in their work, and relax their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation and production work. More seriously, the grassroots political power organizations are seriously impure. Eight of the 22 main cadres in the township were bad elements. For example, Hou Shouyi, Hou Shidun, Wang Xuewen, who served as the cultural and educational committee member and the political instructor of the agricultural production cooperative, were "model village chiefs" and "special commissioners" during the enemy-puppet period. Before liberation, they helped the enemy arrest "regular soldiers" and locked up the masses who could not pay grain in cold houses to freeze and starve. Hou Shidun, nicknamed "Red Monkey," sheltered landlords after the land reform to carry out counter-settlements. Therefore, various policies could not meet the masses and could not be implemented. The vast majority of young women did not participate in political activities. Most farmers were buried in production and did not care about politics. The township always had arrears in public grain burdens every year. Therefore, people in other villages ridiculed Daobei Township as a "bankrupt township."

After vigorously publicizing the general line of the state's transition period and the purchase of surplus grain to the peasants, the masses' awareness has been raised more than before, and a number of new activists have emerged. When the general election began, the working group carefully studied and discussed the backward characteristics and favorable conditions of the township on this basis, and decided to continue to publicize the general line in the general election, raise the political awareness of the masses and general cadres, strengthen the grassroots political power and the Party's leadership role through the general election, purify the grassroots organizations, improve the institutions, and then promote mutual aid and cooperation and production work, and change the face of the backward township. The working group first held a series of township cadre and Party member, Youth League member, and activist meetings to explain to them the great significance, policies, and practices of the election, and patiently educated them separately to dispel the "change of shifts" thinking of some cadres. Then, the working group and township cadres organized to start by helping the masses solve problems in mutual aid and cooperation and production, and carried out extensive publicity, using methods of recalling, comparing, and calculating political accounts to improve the political awareness of the masses. After full ideological mobilization, the masses realized that the current good life is because of the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's control of political power. In the future, if they want to take the socialist road, they must elect good cadres and hold the "knife handle" tightly, so they enthusiastically participated in the election. Ninety-four percent of the voters participated in the election. The political awareness of the masses was improved, and the criminal facts of counter-revolutionary elements such as Hou Shouyi, Hou Shidun, and Wang Xuewen who were drilled into the grassroots organizations were exposed, and they were removed from the grassroots political power. All the voters in the township seriously selected the people they were most satisfied with to be representatives with the attitude of masters. Voters kindly and sincerely pointed out the shortcomings of some cadres with shortcomings in their work style and helped them correct them. Under the identification of the masses, the cadres received a profound democratic education. They took the initiative to make self-criticism to the masses and expressed that they would overcome their shortcomings and serve the people well in the future. This further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses. Finally, 33 people's representatives were elected who were upright, selfless, connected with the masses, actively worked, and led the masses to take the socialist road. Many of them were activists who emerged during the grain purchase and organization of mutual aid and cooperation. The first township people's congress held on February 12 elected the township head and deputy township head and members of the township people's government, and studied and adopted three resolutions, including increasing grain production by 220,000 jin in the township in 1954. The Party, Youth League, and armed forces departments were also rectified. The Party branch absorbed six advanced elements who emerged in the general election campaign and the production campaign into the Party, and the Youth League branch absorbed 14 activists into the League, strengthening the leadership force.

After the completion of the general election work, cadres and the masses took active actions to conscientiously implement the resolutions of the township people's congress, and the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses were greatly improved, showing a vigorous new atmosphere. Party branch secretary Ren Liangfu, township head Qiao Chengshan and other main cadres often lived in the township people's government and often went to the villages to inspect and guide the work. The Civil Affairs Committee completed the rectification of preferential treatment for substitute cultivation within two days and urged the recovery of more than 1,000 jin of substitute cultivation rice. The Mediation Committee mediated five disputes for the masses at a time. The Water Conservancy Committee is organizing the masses to repair the collapsed bridges according to the requirements of the masses. The Production Committee actively leads the masses to vigorously develop and rectify mutual aid and cooperative organizations, carry out fertilizer accumulation and spring plowing preparation work, build and expand two agricultural production cooperatives, and 57 mutual aid groups. The organized farmers have increased from 40% to 65%. In terms of spring plowing preparation, more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer have been accumulated in the township, and spring watering and harrowing have begun. Because the committees have clear division of labor after the general election, the masses said that this general election can greatly change the appearance of Daobei Township. In the past, most of the cadres did not move, and no one was responsible for finding anyone, and nothing could be done well. Now, the cadres have a clear division of labor, unite as one, and are actively responsible, and the work is done quickly and well.

After the general election, the broad masses of the people established the idea of being masters and conscientiously supervised the work and style of representatives and cadres, such as criticizing the pure profit-making views of supply and marketing cooperatives and medical joint cooperatives. The cadres of each unit conducted inspections and paid attention to correcting them. After the general election, the masses automatically paid off the arrears of public grain over the years. And they subscribed to 12.27 million yuan of economic construction bonds in a few days.

The township people's government has established a simple and easy meeting reporting system, and cadres and the masses are satisfied because there are fewer meetings and less delay in work.

    平遥县道备乡经过普选改变了落后面貌
    山西省平遥县道备乡经过基层选举，改变了原来的落后面貌。道备乡是由道备、侯郭两个村组成，有九百六十九户人家，土地平坦，农产也很丰富。解放后虽然经过历次政治运动，特别是在划乡后，各种基层组织都建立起来了，但很不健全，乡人民政府的大门时常关闭着，党的领导薄弱，有一部分党员和团员，忽视政治，工作不积极，放松对互助合作和生产工作的领导。更严重的是基层政权组织严重不纯，全乡二十二个主要干部中竟有八个是坏分子，如担任文教委员、农业生产合作社政治教员的侯守益、侯世墩、王学文等曾是敌伪时期的“模范村长”和“特派员”，解放前帮助敌人抓“常备兵”，把交不起粮的群众关进冷房子冻饿。绰号“红猴儿”的侯世墩，在土地改革后曾包庇地主进行倒算。因而各种政策都和群众见不了面，不能贯彻。青年妇女绝大部分不参加政治活动。大部农民埋头生产，不问政治。公粮负担，该乡年年有尾欠。因此外村人讥讽道备乡为“倒闭乡”。
    经过大张旗鼓地向农民宣传了国家过渡时期总路线和收购余粮以后，群众觉悟较前提高，并涌现出一批新的积极分子。普选开始，工作组便在这个基础上，详细研究讨论了这个乡的落后特点和有利条件，确定在普选中继续宣传总路线，提高群众和一般干部的政治觉悟，通过普选，加强基层政权和党的领导作用，纯洁基层组织，健全机构，进而推动互助合作和生产工作，改变落后乡的面貌。工作组首先召开了一系列的乡干部和党员、团员、积极分子会议，向他们说明选举的重大意义、政策和做法，并分别进行了耐心的教育，打消了一部分干部的“换班”思想。然后，工作组和乡干部组织起来，从帮助群众解决互助合作和生产上的问题入手，开展广泛的宣传，用回忆、对比、算政治账的方法，提高了群众的政治觉悟。经过充分的思想发动，群众认识到现在的美好生活，是因为有共产党的领导和人民掌握了政权，今后要想走社会主义的路，必须选好干部握紧“刀把子”，因而热烈参加了选举。参加选举的选民达到百分之九十四。群众的政治觉悟提高了，把钻在基层组织中的反革命分子侯守益、侯世墩、王学文等的罪恶事实都揭露出来，并把他们从基层政权中剔除出去。全乡选民都以主人翁的态度认真挑选自己最满意的人来当代表。对一些作风上有缺点的干部，选民们善意地、诚恳地指出他们的毛病，帮助他们改正。干部在群众鉴别之下，受到一次深刻的民主教育。他们主动向群众作了检讨，并表示今后要克服缺点，好好为人民服务。这样就进一步密切了干部与群众的关系。最后选出了为人正派、大公无私、联系群众、积极工作、领导群众走社会主义道路的三十三个人民代表，其中很多是收购粮食和组织互助合作时涌现出来的积极分子。二月十二日召开的第一次乡人民代表大会，选举了正副乡长和乡人民政府委员，研究制订并通过了一九五四年全乡增产二十二万斤粮食等三项决议。党、团、武装部等组织也进行了整顿。党支部吸收了在普选运动中和生产运动中涌现出来的六个先进分子入党，团支部吸收了十四个积极分子入团，加强了领导力量。
    普选工作完成后，干部和群众均以积极的行动认真贯彻乡人民代表大会的决议，群众的政治积极性和生产积极性都大大提高，出现了生气勃勃的新气象。党支部书记任良富、乡长乔成山等主要干部经常住在乡人民政府，并经常下乡到各村检查指导工作。民政委员会在两天内完成了优抚代耕的整顿工作，催收了代耕米一千余斤。调解委员会一次便给群众调解了五件纠纷。水利委员会正根据群众要求，开始组织群众修建塌毁了的桥梁。生产委员会积极领导群众，大力发展和整顿互助合作组织，开展积肥和春耕准备工作，新建和扩大了两个农业生产合作社，五十七个互助组，组织起来的农户已由百分之四十增加到百分之六十五。在春耕准备工作方面，全乡已积肥十万斤以上，春浇和耙耱地已经开始。由于普选后各委员会分工明确，群众反映说：这次普选可把道备乡大变样了，过去的工作是多数干部不动，找谁谁也不负责，什么事也办不了，办不好；现在是干部分工明确，团结一致，都积极负责，工作办得又快又好。
    经过普选，广大人民群众树立了主人翁思想，认真监督代表和干部的工作和作风，如批评供销社和医联社的单纯营利观点。各该单位的干部便进行了检查，注意改正。普选后群众自动把历年的尾欠公粮交清。并在几天内认购了一千二百二十七万元的经济建设公债。
    乡人民政府建立了简便易行的会议汇报制度，干部群众都因开会少、误工少而感到满意。
