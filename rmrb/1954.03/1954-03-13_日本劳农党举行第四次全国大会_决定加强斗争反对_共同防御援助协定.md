Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 12th: The Fourth National Congress of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party was held in Tokyo from the 8th to the 10th. The congress decided that the future direction of struggle would be to oppose the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" and overthrow the Yoshida government, and elected a new leadership.

    The congress pointed out that the new agreement between the United States and Japan for the US imperialist rule of Japan, the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," etc., is deepening Japan's status as a vassal, and the rule of monopoly capital is also being strengthened. Therefore, the Japan Labor-Farmer Party decided to form a united front to strive for national independence and democracy, to fight for crushing the rearmament budget, defending peace, democracy, and the Japanese Constitution, and promoting Japan-China and Japan-Soviet trade.

    The congress elected a new leadership consisting of sixty-four members of the Central Committee and four members of the Supervisory Committee. Hisao Kuroda was re-elected as the chairman of the party, and Kenji Nakahara was re-elected as the general secretary of the party.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 11th: Kenji Nakahara, the General Secretary of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party, issued a statement strongly opposing the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement."

    Kenji Nakahara said that the Yoshida government, colluding with the war forces of the United States, has put the new yoke of the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" on Japan's neck, attempting to make Japanese youths and former soldiers wear military uniforms. He pointed out that the implementation of a conscription system and the revision of the Constitution will follow the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." The US-Japan reactionaries are also preparing to formulate reactionary laws such as the law prohibiting teachers from engaging in political activities and the "Military Secrets Protection Law."

    Kenji Nakahara declared: We will do everything in our power to fight against the above-mentioned conspiracy of the Yoshida government.
