Various Forms of Servility

	The Lackey's "Demonstration"

	On January 22nd, over two thousand Franco supporters in Madrid launched an anti-British and French demonstration. The demonstrators demanded that Britain return Gibraltar and also "protested" against France's colonial policies in Monaco. They smashed the windows of the British Embassy with stones and tore a French flag in front of a store to shreds, then raised an American flag.

	According to a United Press dispatch from Madrid on January 22nd, before this demonstration, Franco's newspapers had already issued provocative signals, saying that when the Franco government "was about to implement the treaty with the United States exchanging aid for bases," Britain and France had criticisms, which damaged Franco's "reputation." Why did the fascist dictator in Madrid become so presumptuous towards Britain and France? It is not difficult to understand that since the US government and Franco signed a military agreement on September 26th last year, Franco became dizzy with success, thinking he had a backer, and constantly barked at his neighbors. The image of a dog relying on its "master's" power is fully displayed here.

	Seeking Advice from a "Junior"

	According to a TASS report on November 13th last year, the Adenauer group requested his American master to send the American fascist Senator McCarthy to Bonn. It is said that "spies" were discovered in the West German press and radio stations, and McCarthy was invited to "screen" them because McCarthy was the "person for the job."

	People know that the West German lackey made this request not without reason, because the Wall Street bosses had long planned to bring McCarthy's "screening" methods to West Germany. In order to make this matter "legitimate," the Wall Street bosses spread the word that West German newspapers had gone astray in many ways. Of course, Adenauer understood his master's intention. Although he himself was a veteran fascist, he had to ask the "rising star" American fascist for advice in order to curry favor with his master.

		Complete Betrayal

	According to a report in the American "Herald Tribune" last November, on November 8th last year, when US Vice President Nixon arrived in Taiwan, the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly begged to include the large and small islands near Taiwan within the US-Taiwan joint defense system. People remember that Chiang Kai-shek had made similar proposals more than once. Last August, after the United States and Syngman Rhee signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang told Higgins, a reporter for the American "Herald Tribune," that he hoped that the United States and Taiwan would also have a "defense treaty similar to the one between the United States and South Korea." He said that American "aid" to Taiwan was only a "temporary guarantee," and he "hoped that this guarantee would become a permanent guarantee of an international treaty."

	It is a universally known fact that Taiwan is the territory occupied by the United States, and Chiang Kai-shek is the watchdog for the United States in Taiwan. However, Chiang Kai-shek feels guilty and always feels that his position as a running dog is unstable. Therefore, the "temporary guarantee" cannot satisfy him, and he wants his master to give him a "permanent guarantee." The true colors of a running dog are truly revealed. (Picture Attached)

    形形色色的奴才相
    奴才的“示威”
    一月二十二日，两千多佛朗哥分子在马德里掀起了一个反英、法示威运动。示威者要求英国交还直布罗陀，还“抗议”法国在摩纳哥的殖民政策，他们用石头砸碎了英国大使馆的门窗，并且把一家商店的法国旗子撕得粉碎，然后升起了一面美国国旗。
    据美联社马德里一月二十二日电讯报道，在这次示威以前，佛朗哥的报纸就发出了寻衅的信号，说是当佛朗哥政府“要实施与美国缔结的以援助交换基地的条约时”，英、法两国曾有非议，这些非议败坏了佛朗哥的“名誉”。马德里的法西斯独裁者为什么对英、法两国这样放肆起来了呢？不难理解，自从去年九月二十六日美国政府和佛朗哥签订了军事协定以后，佛朗哥自以为有了靠山，便得意忘形，不断地向四邻狂吠。狗仗“人”势的形象在这里十足地表现出来了。向“后辈”请教
    据塔斯社去年十一月十三日报道，阿登纳集团曾请求他的美国主子把美国法西斯参议员麦卡锡派到波恩去。据说在西德的新闻界和广播电台发现了“特务”分子，要请麦卡锡去“甄别”一番，因为麦卡锡正是“干这事的人”。
    人们知道，西德奴才提出了这个请求，不是没有来由的，因为华尔街老板早就打算要把麦卡锡的一套“甄别”方法，带到西德去。为了把这件事做得“名正言顺”，华尔街老板便放出风声来说，西德报纸在许多方面走错了路线。当然，阿登纳领会了主子的这个意旨，虽然自己是老牌的法西斯，但是为了奉承主子，不得不向“后起之秀”的美国法西斯请教了。
      彻底的出卖
    据去年十一月份美国“先驱论坛报”报道，去年十一月八日，当美国副总统尼克松到达台湾时，匪首蒋介石曾一再哀求要把台湾附近的大小岛屿，划入美国和台湾联防制度以内。人们记得，蒋匪类似这样的提议，已不止一次了。去年八月，当美国和李承晚签订了所谓“共同防御条约”以后，蒋介石匪帮曾向美国“先驱论坛报”的记者希金斯说，他希望美国和台湾也有一个“类似美国和南朝鲜的防御条约”，他说美国“援助”台湾只是“暂时的保证”，他“希望这种保证成为一项国际条约的永久保证”。
    台湾是被美国霸占的天下，蒋介石是美国在台湾的看家狗，这已是举世皆知的事实。但是蒋匪作贼心虚，总觉得自己这个走狗的地位不稳，于是“暂时的保证”不能满足了，还要主子给他来个“永久的保证”。走狗的本色，真是活现了。（附图片）
