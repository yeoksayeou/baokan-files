    "Stalin Death Anniversary Exhibition" opened on the 6th at the Beijing Library. The opening ceremony was held at 10:15 in the morning, with Feng Zhongyun, director of the Beijing Library, delivering the opening address. In the morning, Ding Xilin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, heads of various democratic parties, people from all walks of life, diplomatic officials from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries' embassies in China, and representatives of the Soviet Union's Foreign Cultural Association in China visited the exhibition.

    In the center of the exhibition hall stood a huge statue of Stalin, and the room was filled with a quiet and solemn atmosphere. The entire exhibition is divided into eight units, exhibiting more than 200 photographs related to Stalin's life, revolutionary activities, and writings, as well as more than 150 books and periodicals in twenty languages. The content from the first to the third unit narrates Stalin's childhood and early revolutionary activities in the Caucasus, as well as the scenes of leading the October Revolution uprising with Lenin.

    From the fourth to the sixth unit, visitors can see moving pictures and writings of Stalin leading the Soviet people in building a socialist society and advancing victoriously towards communism after defeating the fascist German invaders. Among the translations in various languages of Stalin's historically significant work "On the Questions of Leninism" on display, there is Chiang Kuang-chi's translation of "The Principle of the National Question in Leninism" (i.e., Chapter 6 "The National Question" of "Foundations of Leninism") published in the fourth issue of the "New Youth" quarterly in December 1924, and Qu Qiubai's summarized translation of "An Outline of Leninism" published in the first issue of the "New Youth" monthly in April 1925. These are the earliest versions of Stalin's theoretical works introduced to China.

    In the seventh unit, labeled "The Greatest Friendship," the first exhibit is a facsimile of the original text of Stalin's famous essay "Do Not Forget the East," published on November 24, 1918. When visitors saw the photo of "The Tomb of the Heroic Soviet Air Force Martyrs Sacrificed in Wuhan," they couldn't help but recall the history of the arduous years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when Stalin sent outstanding Soviet sons and daughters to help the Chinese people resist the Japanese invaders, and more than one hundred heroic Soviet pilots shed their blood on Chinese soil. Here, visitors also saw many pictures of Chairman Mao's visit to the Soviet Union to meet Stalin, the signing ceremony of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and Soviet experts helping China build Anshan Iron and Steel Works. Chairman Mao's speech at the celebration of Stalin's 60th birthday by all circles in Yan'an and his article "Stalin is a Friend of the Chinese People" written at that time, as well as the book "The Greatest Friendship," are also displayed here.

    The last unit illustrates Stalin's great contribution to the cause of world peace. The pictures reflect the active construction of various People's Democratic countries with Soviet assistance, as well as the portraits of outstanding peace fighters from various countries who won the Stalin International Peace Prize from 1950 to 1953 "For Strengthening International Peace."

    “斯大林逝世一周年纪念展览会”在京开幕
    【新华社讯】“斯大林逝世一周年纪念展览会”六日在北京图书馆开幕。开幕式在上午十时十五分举行，由北京图书馆馆长冯仲云致开幕词。当天上午，有中央人民政府文化部副部长丁西林，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，各民主党派负责人，各界人士，苏联和各人民民主国家驻我国使馆的外交官员以及苏联对外文化协会驻我国代表等前往参观。
    展览会的正中放置着斯大林巨大的塑像，室内充满了静穆、庄严的气氛。全部展览分为八个单元，展出有关斯大林生平革命活动和著述的图片二百多幅，及二十种文字的书刊一百五十多册，从第一个单元到第三个单元的内容，叙述了斯大林的幼年时代，和早期在高加索各地领导革命活动以及和列宁一起领导十月革命起义的情景。
    第四个单元到第六个单元，可看到斯大林领导苏联人民建设社会主义社会和战胜法西斯德寇后，向共产主义胜利前进的动人图片和著述。会上陈列着的斯大林的具有历史意义的著作“论列宁主义底几个问题”的各国文字译本中，有一九二四年十二月出版的“新青年”季刊第四期上刊载的蒋光赤译的“列宁主义之民族问题的原理”
  （即“论列宁主义基础”第六章“民族问题”）和一九二五年四月出版的“新青年”月刊第一号发表瞿秋白摘要译述的“列宁主义概论”一文。这是最早介绍到中国来的斯大林理论著作的版本。
    标写着“最伟大的友谊”的第七个单元里，首先展出的是斯大林同志在一九一八年十一月二十四日发表的“不要忘记东方”著名论文的原文影印部分。参观者看到“武汉英勇牺牲的苏联空军烈士墓”照片时，不禁使人回忆起在抗日战争的艰苦年代里，斯大林派来了苏联优秀的儿女，帮助中国人民反抗日寇的侵略，一百多位英勇的苏联飞行员把鲜血洒在中国土地上的史迹。在这里，参观者又看到毛主席访问苏联会见斯大林、中苏友好同盟互助条约签订仪式和苏联专家帮助我国建设鞍钢等的图片多幅。毛主席在延安各界庆祝斯大林六十寿辰大会上的讲话和当时所写的“斯大林是中国人民的朋友”一文以及“最伟大的友谊”一书也陈列在这里。
    最后一个单元说明斯大林对全世界和平事业的伟大贡献，图片中反映了在苏联帮助下，各人民民主国家积极建设的面貌，还有从一九五○年到一九五三年“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者世界各国杰出的和平战士们的肖像。
