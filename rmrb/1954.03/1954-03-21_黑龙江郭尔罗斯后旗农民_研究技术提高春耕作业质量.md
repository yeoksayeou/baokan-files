Farmers in Gorlos Posterior Banner (i.e., Zhaoyuan County), Heilongjiang Province, which was awarded the honorary title of "High-Yield County" in 1952, are actively preparing for spring ploughing and studying techniques to improve the quality of spring operations.

This year, the total cultivated area of Gorlos Posterior Banner will reach more than 131,000 hectares, of which more than 115,300 hectares will be grain crops. The total output is required to reach 970,000 shi, an increase of 9.5% over the bumper year of 1952 and an increase of 35.6% over the disaster-stricken year of 1953. Recently, the CPC Gorlos Posterior Banner Committee convened a banner-wide party representative meeting to mobilize all party members to lead farmers in further promoting technological reforms, creating more effective high-yield experiences, and completing the production increase plan. Based on the instructions of the CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the banner's technological reform experience over the past two years, the Banner Committee proposed new technical yield-increasing methods of "soil preparation to preserve moisture, increased application of base fertilizer, equidistant wide sowing, and thinning to protect seedlings." It also guided cadres and farmers to focus on studying improved methods for fertilization, seed treatment, and sowing to preserve moisture during spring ploughing, and proposed technical requirements for sowing major crops such as sorghum, millet, soybeans, corn, and wheat. Through the agricultural technology reform movement, in addition to generally improving general farming methods, it is also necessary to cultivate high-yield fields accounting for 20% of the banner's grain crop area, with a yield per hectare required to be more than 85% higher than the normal yield. To set higher yield examples for farmers, each district must cultivate one or two high-yield villages, and each village must cultivate two or three high-yield mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives.

In order to complete this year's production increase task, farmers in the banner began preparing for spring ploughing as early as last winter. According to statistics from more than a month ago, the banner added 786 head of major draft animals, 615 carts, and more than 6,600 various farm implements. 97% of the farmers in the banner have been organized, of which 47% have joined year-round mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 90. Over the past two years, the banner has also vigorously promoted technological reforms, stimulating the creativity of farmers in increasing production out of patriotism. Therefore, this year's agricultural production increase in the banner has more favorable conditions.

    黑龙江郭尔罗斯后旗农民
    研究技术提高春耕作业质量
    一九五二年获得“丰产县”光荣称号的黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗（即肇源县）的干部和农民，正积极准备春耕，研究提高春耕作业质量的技术。
    郭尔罗斯后旗今年耕地总面积将达到十三万一千余垧，其中粮食作物为十一万五千三百多垧，总产量要求达到九十七万石，比丰产的一九五二年提高百分之九点五，比受灾的一九五三年增产百分之三十五点六。最近中共郭后旗委会，召开了全旗党代表会议，动员全体党员带动农民，进一步推行技术改革，创造更有成效的丰产经验，完成增产计划。旗委根据中共黑龙江省委的指示及该旗两年来的技术改革经验，提出了“整地保墒、增施底肥、等距宽播、间苗保苗”新的技术增产办法；并领导干部和农民着重研究了春耕中施肥、种籽处理、播种保墒等工作的改进办法，提出了高粱、谷子、大豆、苞米、小麦等主要作物的播种技术要求。通过农业技术改革运动，除普遍改进一般耕作方法外，并要培植占全旗粮谷作物面积百分之二十的丰产田，每垧产量要求比常年产量提高百分之八十五以上。为给农民树立更高的产量榜样，各区都要培养一两个丰产村，每村培养两三个丰产互助组或农业生产合作社。
    该旗农民为完成今年增产任务，早在去年冬天就开始进行春耕准备工作。据一个多月前的统计，全旗增添了七百八十六头主要耕畜，六百十五辆车，各种农具六千六百多件。全旗百分之九十七的农户已经组织起来，其中百分之四十七的农户参加了常年互助组，农业生产合作社发展到九十个。两年来该旗又大力提倡技术改革，激发了农民爱国增产的创造性。所以，该旗今年的农业增产具有更为有利的条件。
