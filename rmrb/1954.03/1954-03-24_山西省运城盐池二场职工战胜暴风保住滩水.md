    Shanxi Province, Yuncheng Salt Pond No. 2 Farm Workers Overcome Storm and Preserve Pond Water
    After studying the General Line, the workers of the state-owned No. 2 Farm of Yuncheng Salt Pond in Shanxi Province have greatly increased their enthusiasm for labor and love their salt farm even more.
    On the evening of March 9th this year, a sudden storm arose, and the northern embankment of the "polygonal" evaporation pond, which stored 46,500 cubic meters of pond water, was breached. When the workers of the first group learned of this, they immediately grabbed iron shovels, baskets, and sacks and ran to the rescue. Later, the workers of the second group also came to help. They said, "We must learn from the spirit of the Volunteer Army in the Battle of Shangganling, and we will not go back until we stop the water!" They worked continuously for five or six hours, finally completing the task of blocking the water and preserving the pond water.

    山西省运城盐池二场职工战胜暴风保住滩水
    山西运城盐池国营二场职工，经过总路线学习后，劳动积极性大大提高，更加热爱自己的盐场。
    今年三月九日晚上，忽然刮起了暴风，储存四万六千五百立方滩水的“多角形”蒸发池北堰被水打开了。第一组工人知道后，立即拿着铁锨、筐子、麻袋跑去抢救。后来，第二组的工人也来支援。他们说：“我们要学习志愿军在上甘岭战斗的精神，堵不住水决不回去！”他们接连工作了五六小时，终于完成了堵水任务，保住了滩水。
