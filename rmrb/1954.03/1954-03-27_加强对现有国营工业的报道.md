Strengthen Reporting on Existing State-Owned Industries
    Dong Qian
    While concentrating efforts on establishing a new industrial base, the Party and the government attach great importance to managing well and fully utilizing existing state-owned industries. China's existing state-owned industries are the material foundation for current production development and economic prosperity, the leading force in the socialist transformation of non-socialist economies, and an important force supporting new enterprises. Our provincial and municipal newspapers, especially those in industrial cities, should undoubtedly report well on the production and operation of existing state-owned industries.

    Clearly Understand What Should Be Publicized
    To do a good job in publicizing existing state-owned industries, we must first clearly understand what to publicize. Based on the situation of existing state-owned industries and the experiences and lessons learned from some newspapers' publicity, the following points should be focused on in terms of publicity content:

    First, popularize and concretely promote the significant meaning of rebuilding, managing well, and fully utilizing existing state-owned industries for realizing national socialist industrialization, and struggle against ideological tendencies that ignore this important meaning. The purpose of doing this is to encourage people to explore the potential of existing state-owned industries, improve labor productivity and equipment utilization, and improve existing industries, so that existing industries can make greater contributions to national industrialization. In this publicity, some newspapers, because they themselves do not attach enough importance to the issue of tapping the potential of existing state-owned industries, have neither explained its important significance and contribution to national industrialization nor criticized bad ideological tendencies. In addition, some newspapers, although relatively重视, and have made certain efforts in promoting the tapping of potential, finding shortcuts, and improving labor productivity and equipment utilization in existing state-owned industries, have not done enough in publicizing its significance and criticizing the ideological tendencies of ignoring existing state-owned industries. Taking Anhui Daily as an example, in the reports on the Huainan state-owned factories and mines and the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant on February 1st and 19th, it was stated that the Xin Zhuangzi Coal Mine had begun to carry out mechanized transportation reform in the fourth quarter of last year, and the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant had improved the equipment of the furnace after learning the advanced design method of the Soviet "full wind fast material method," thereby improving labor productivity and equipment utilization. If the newspaper could explain what significance these achievements have for realizing national socialist industrialization, and under what ideological guidance they were achieved, it would have a profound educational and promoting effect on overcoming the thought of not being content with working in existing factories, and mobilizing people to actively improve existing state-owned industries. However, the newspaper did not explain this point. This weakened the ideological guiding role of the newspaper in the publicity of existing state-owned industries. The phenomenon of only reporting production processes and production achievements in isolation without focusing on this central idea also exists in some newspapers.

    Second, promote improving the operation and management of existing socialist industries, improving technology, strengthening planning management and technical management, strengthening economic accounting, reducing costs, improving quality, increasing production under the condition of ensuring quality, and comprehensively completing and overfulfilling the state plan. This publicity must be the center that newspapers always pay attention to. In this regard, in general, all newspapers have made publicity, the difference lies in the quantity and quality of the reports. For example, the Lüda People's Daily focused on reporting on improving quality, reducing costs, comprehensively carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and striving to complete the state plan in June, November, and December of last year. In these reports, on the one hand, it praised the Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau for cooperating with factories and mines to conduct quality appraisal, and promoting leading cadres of factories and mines to pay attention to improving quality; the hard alloy workshop of Dalian Steel Plant for completing the annual plan ahead of schedule and supplying the needs of 85 factories and mines in Anshan, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, etc. On the other hand, it criticized the poor product quality of Jinzhou Textile Factory and Lüda Knitting Factory, as well as the failure of Electrical Engineering Plant No. 2 and others to complete the May plan, affecting the progress of Anshan Iron and Steel basic construction, etc. In some of the newspaper's commentaries, it also particularly required leading cadres of factories and mines to establish the overall concept of subordinating to the state plan, overcome departmentalism, and strive to complete this central task. From the depth or breadth of the above reports, the Lüda People's Daily has made certain efforts in grasping this link. For another example, Anhui Daily also reported on the campaign to increase production and practice economy in local state-owned industries last year, and reported in February this year that various mines of the Huainan Mining Bureau and eleven local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Bengbu City had overfulfilled the January production plan, and reflected readers' criticisms of the poor quality of matches produced by the Wuhu Match Factory, etc. These reports undoubtedly have a certain promoting effect on the work. However, it has not been able to reflect the main situations and main problems in the actual work, so that readers cannot clearly see the whole picture of the progress of this work. It is understood that the work of six state-owned factories and mines and seventy local state-owned factories and mines in Anhui Province last year has been improved to varying degrees in all aspects. There has also been a significant improvement in product quality, and the poor quality phenomena such as "soap deformation," "poor cigarette taste, paper roll cracking," "matches that do not light, or do not light on the stick," and "sad yarn" have been changed. Production costs have also been reduced. According to the statistics of seventeen factories, the total cost has been reduced by an average of 3% compared with the annual plan. At the same time, through the campaign to increase production and practice economy, many factories and mines have changed the backward state of production. The state-owned factories and mines in the province overfulfilled the state plan by 11.5%, and the profits turned over also exceeded 55%. If the newspaper could systematically report on these rich and vivid materials in actual work, it would enrich the content of the newspaper's publicity on existing state-owned industries and encourage people's enthusiasm to improve existing state-owned industries.

    Third, promote the contributions of existing state-owned industries in supplying new factories and mines with machines and various equipment, supplying new factories and mines with cadres and technical workers, and accumulating the funds needed to develop new industries. As reported by Anhui Daily on March 6th, Anhui's local industries have supplied various machines and equipment to industry and agriculture in recent years, such as air compressors, pumps, waterwheels, cotton gins, etc. In the past two years, only a part of the factories and mines have accumulated more than 100 billion yuan of funds for the state. However, in the past, not only Anhui Daily, but also many other newspapers have not paid enough attention to reporting on this aspect. Taking the Lüda People's Daily, which pays more attention to this publicity, as an example, the newspaper focused on reporting on the issue of "producing machines and producing talents" to support national key construction last year. The newspaper not only reported on the achievements of many factories in trial-producing new products and their contributions to national key construction, but also revealed the departmentalism of some factory cadres who believed that the trial production of new products was a "burden," "accessory," and "it doesn't matter if it is delayed," etc. At the same time, the newspaper also published nearly 30 reports, reflecting the situation of training and transferring cadres. Among them, the reports on the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory and other four factories, Dalian Crane Factory and other thirteen factories published on December 4th and 31st last year comprehensively reflected the situation of actively training talents and sending excellent talents to new factories and new industrial bases across the country to support national key construction. Supplying new factories and mines with machines and technical workers is the responsibility of existing state-owned industries to help national construction, and it is also an important content of our newspaper reports. Therefore, we must pay attention to this publicity.

    Of course, the reports of the Lüda People's Daily in this regard are not always done well. According to the Lüda People's Daily's inspection, there are still many vivid examples of supporting national key construction that the newspaper has not reported.

    Fourth, promote how existing state-owned industries complete the task of meeting the people's needs for industrial products. In a considerable period of time, the industrial products needed by the people mainly rely on the supply of existing state-owned industries. Taking Anhui and Lüda as examples, many industrial products needed by the state and the people are directly supplied by local existing state-owned industries. Such as train passenger cars, waterwheels, fertilizers, textiles, furniture, matches, etc. However, newspapers rarely report on these. For example, the Lüda People's Daily said in its inspection that the quality of some products of local state-owned industries has been significantly improved recently, such as enamel utensils, gold pens, cloth, and flannel shirts, which are welcomed by the masses, but the newspaper has not reported much. This makes people unable to see the close relationship between industrial production and their own interests from industrial reports, and cannot get the power of encouragement.

    Finally, newspapers should also pay appropriate attention to publicizing the leading role of existing state-owned industrial enterprises in the socialist transformation of non-socialist economies. It should be understood that in order to complete China's socialist industrialization, the existing capitalist industry and handicrafts must be transformed into socialism. Therefore, this is also an aspect that cannot be ignored in the publicity of existing state-owned industries.

    Main Methods of Deeply Expressing Content
    After understanding the content of the reports, we must also pay attention to publicity methods, otherwise, we cannot express deep ideological content. There are many methods of publicity, but the most effective method to attract local people to actively participate in improving existing industries and supporting national construction is "to use explanations and statements to derive the interests of local people from the national interests, and to propose specific local tasks to the local people." (Resolution of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921: "On the Program of Local Newspapers")

    The Lüda People's Daily stated this point in the 1953 report summary, that is, any report that can proceed from local characteristics, explain the benefits of national key construction to the existing state-owned industries and the people's interests in Lüda, explain the role of existing state-owned industries in national key construction, and point out that supporting national key construction is the specific task and direction of efforts of the people of Lüda can play a role in inspiring and mobilizing the masses. Otherwise, it cannot or cannot play this role well.

    The Lüda People's Daily's reports "The Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory Actively Completes Anshan Iron and Steel Orders" and "Freight Cars from the Steel Capital" published on September 18th and December 12th last year are better reports. For example, the former report, on the one hand, explained the role of national key construction in the existing state-owned industries in Lüda by supplying most of the steel needed by Anshan Iron and Steel to Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory to produce 60-ton bottom-turning cars, small locomotives, and road rollers; on the other hand, it explained the role of existing state-owned industries in national industrialization by Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory completing the order tasks for Anshan Iron and Steel. This enables workers and the masses to specifically understand the principle of "Anshan Iron and Steel supports us, and we support Anshan Iron and Steel; supporting Anshan Iron and Steel is supporting the whole country" from their personal experience, so as to actively invest in the upsurge of national economic construction. The report said: After experiencing that the materials supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel were of good quality, suitable hardness and softness, and fast and good work, the workers of the factory expressed that "we must better support Anshan Iron and Steel, so that Anshan Iron and Steel can produce better and more things, so that the motherland can be industrialized as soon as possible." In economic construction, the role that Anshan Iron and Steel key construction plays in Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory is not only this point, nor is it limited to this factory; at the same time, in addition to Anshan Iron and Steel key construction, other national key construction is also supporting the existing state-owned industrial enterprises in Lüda, and is also affecting the people's economic life. For example, a large number of production raw materials such as steel and castings used by many factories in Lüda are supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel; the equipment expanded by many factories is supplied by state-owned machine manufacturing factories across the country; the fuel used by many factories is supplied by Fuxin, Fushun, and other coal mines; the petroleum raw materials used by Dalian Petroleum Factory are supplied by Yumen Oil Mine in the far northwest. All this vividly illustrates the role of national key construction in local existing state-owned industries, and can vividly derive the interests of local people and the interests of factories and mines from the national interests, and attract people to participate in the construction work in the common political and economic life. However, in this regard, as the Lüda People's Daily inspected, due to the unclear guiding ideology in the past, these vivid examples were not seized for prominent reports.

    Through these vivid examples, the newspaper can not only educate all the people to recognize the extremely important significance of national socialist industrialization, and recognize that it is the highest interest of the people of the whole country, and also the immediate interests of the local people; but also can powerfully refute the erroneous ideas that violate the general line such as "industrialization is not important" and "industrialization has no benefit to the local people." Publicizing the general line through various specific examples, criticizing all ideological tendencies that violate the general line, and guiding people to strive to realize the general line is the special mission given to the Party newspaper by the Party in the transition period.

    The main tasks of the existing factories and industrial bases are to supply new factories and new industrial bases with machines and various equipment, to supply cadres and technical workers, and to accumulate the funds needed to develop new industries. Therefore, in addition to explaining the national interests and the specific local interests, it is also necessary to propose specific tasks to the local people. For example, the main tasks and characteristics of the existing industry in Lüda are to supply machines and talents for key construction. The enlarged meeting of the CPC Lüda Municipal Committee in 1952 pointed out: "Lüda is a city that was liberated earlier and has a more solid industrial foundation. In large-scale economic construction, it should shoulder the task of producing machines, producing cadres, and producing skilled workers." The specific local tasks proposed by the Lüda Municipal Committee to the people of Lüda according to the characteristics of Lüda are precisely what the Lüda People's Daily should specifically implement in the publicity of existing state-owned industries.

    The practice of the Lüda People's Daily over the past year has proved that reports that can specifically implement and embody this central idea through typical events can have a relatively profound impact on the local masses. The report on the successful trial production of high-grade cement by the Seventh Cement Plant reported on January 17 last year, and the Dalian Steel Plant event reported continuously in July, August, and September are two relatively prominent examples. The former publicized the significance and role of existing state-owned factories in supporting national key construction through the specific facts that the employees of the Cement Plant overcame difficulties, actively completed tasks, and ensured the needs of a certain important project of Anshan Iron and Steel after knowing that they were manufacturing high-grade cement for Anshan Iron and Steel, and encouraged the labor enthusiasm of workers and the masses to fight for supporting national key construction. The latter powerfully illustrates that if existing state-owned industries are not managed well, the entire national construction will be harmed through the typical event that Dalian Steel Plant has not completed the national plan for six consecutive months, affecting the production of more than 100 factories. Because this report seized a typical event in the local industrial construction, it achieved great results. Not only did the responsible cadres of Dalian Steel Plant make a review, but also the responsible persons of five factories including Dalian Motor Factory conducted inspections in the newspaper in connection with this event.

    However, because the central idea of supporting national key construction has not been systematically formed into the guiding ideology of the newspaper, the number of reports that embody this central idea as mentioned above is still small. As the Lüda People's Daily said in its inspection, many reports are often irrelevant and do not talk about the topic.

    Here is just one example to illustrate. Last year, Dalian Crane Factory manufactured a large number of earth-moving vehicles for the Huai River project. Because of the poor quality, it was criticized by the Huai River migrant workers. The workers who went to the construction site to repair the factory reported the opinions of the Huai River migrant workers to the factory, explaining that the poor quality of the earth-moving vehicles they manufactured affected the situation of the great Huai River project, and everyone actively improved the quality. This is the most vivid and convincing example of specifically promoting the worker-peasant alliance and industry supporting agriculture. However, the newspaper did not seize these main points for prominent publicity, but only made a general report on improving technology and improving quality. This cannot educate the broad masses to recognize the relationship between managing the existing state-owned industries well and the country and themselves, and therefore cannot deeply achieve the effectiveness of the newspaper's publicity and mobilization.

    The above experience proves that, according to local characteristics, a large number of facts mainly taken from the local area are reflected, and through these facts, the role of national key construction in the local existing industry, the role of the local existing industry in supporting national key construction, and the role of the existing industry in meeting the needs of the people's production and life are explained to the local people, and various erroneous ideological tendencies that ignore national industrialization and ignore the full utilization of existing state-owned industries are struggled against. This is an important method to do a good job in the publicity of existing state-owned industries and complete the work of mobilizing the masses to participate in national economic construction. Our provincial and municipal newspapers, especially the newspapers of industrial cities, should attach importance to this experience, strengthen the reports on existing state-owned industries according to local characteristics, and further improve the ideological level of the reports.

专栏：报纸工作述评

    加强对现有国营工业的报道
    董　谦
    党和政府在集中力量建立新的工业基础的同时，十分重视办好和充分利用现有的国营工业。我国现有的国营工业是目前发展生产、繁荣经济的物质基础，是对非社会主义经济进行社会主义改造的领导力量，也是支持新建企业的重要力量。我们的省、市报纸特别是工业城市报纸，毫无疑问，应该很好地报道现有国营工业的生产与经营情况。
    要明确了解应该宣传什么
    作好现有国营工业的宣传工作，首先要明确了解宣传什么。依据现有国营工业的情况和一些报纸宣传的经验教训，在宣传内容上，主要应该抓取以下几点：
    第一，通俗而具体地宣传改建、办好和充分利用现有国营工业对实现国家社会主义工业化的重要意义，并和那些忽视这一重要意义的思想倾向进行斗争。这样做的目的，是为了推动人们发掘现有国营工业的潜在力量，提高劳动生产率和设备利用率，改进现有的工业，从而使现有的工业对国家工业化作出更大的贡献。在这一宣传中，有些报纸因为本身就对发挥现有国营工业潜力的问题不够重视，所以既未说明它的重要意义和对国家工业化的贡献，也未批判不良思想倾向。另外，有些报纸虽比较重视，并在推动现有国营工业挖潜力、找窍门、提高劳动生产率和设备利用率方面，作了一定的努力，但在宣传它的意义和批判忽视现有国营工业的思想倾向方面，却作得很不够。以安徽日报为例，在二月一日、十九日关于淮南国营工厂矿山和马鞍山铁厂的报道中，曾表明新庄孜煤矿由于去年第四季度着手进行了机械化运输改革，马鞍山铁厂由于学习了苏联“全风快料法”的先进设计方法后，改善了炉子的设备，从而提高了劳动生产率和设备利用率。报纸如果能说明这些成就对实现国家社会主义工业化有什么意义，又是在什么思想指导下取得的，那么，它就会对克服不安心于现有工厂工作的思想，和动员人们积极改进现有的国营工业发生深刻的教育和推动作用。可是，报纸没有去说明这一点。这就削弱了报纸在现有国营工业宣传中的思想指导作用。不围绕这一中心思想而只孤立报道生产过程、生产成就的现象，在一些报纸中也是存在着。
    第二，宣传改善现有的社会主义工业的经营管理，提高技术，加强计划管理和技术管理，加强经济核算，降低成本，提高质量，在保证质量的条件下增加产量，全面地完成和超额完成国家计划。这个宣传，必须是报纸经常注意的中心。在这一方面，总的来说，各报都作了宣传，所不同者是报道数量和报道质量上的差异。例如，旅大人民日报在去年六、十一、十二月间，曾着重报道了提高质量、降低成本、全面开展增产节约运动，争取完成国家计划。在这些报道中，一方面表扬了旅大市工业局协同厂矿进行质量鉴定，推动厂矿领导干部注意改进质量；大连钢厂硬质合金车间提前完成全年计划，供应了鞍山、上海、天津等地八十五个厂矿的需要，等等。另一方面，批评了金州纺织厂、旅大针织厂产品质量低劣，以及电工二厂等未完成五月份计划，影响鞍钢基本建设进度，等等。在该报的一些评论中，还特别要求厂矿领导干部必须确立服从国家计划的整体思想，克服本位主义思想，努力完成这一中心任务。从上述报道的深度或广度说，旅大人民日报在抓取这个环节上是作了一定努力的。再如，安徽日报也在去年报道了地方国营工业中的增产节约运动，在今年二月份报道了淮南矿务局各矿和蚌埠市十一个地方国营、公私合营工厂超额完成一月份生产计划，并反映了读者对芜湖市火柴厂所生产的火柴质量低劣所提出的批评，等等。这些报道无疑对工作都有一定的推动作用。但是，它还没能反映出实际工作中的主要情况和主要问题，使读者还不能清晰地看出这一工作进展的全貌。据了解，去年安徽省六个国营厂矿、七十个地方国营厂矿的工作，在各方面都有程度不同的改进。在产品质量方面也有显著提高，已经改变了“肥皂变形”、“香烟味差，纸卷裂口”、“火柴不着火，着火不上杆”、“伤心纱”等质量低劣现象。在生产成本方面，也有所降低，据十七个厂的统计，总成本较年计划平均降低百分之三。同时，经过增产节约运动，有很多厂矿改变了生产上的落后状态，全省国营厂矿超额完成国家计划百分之十一点五，上缴利润也超过百分之五十五。像实际工作中这许多丰富生动的材料，如果报纸能系统地加以报道，那就更会丰富报纸对现有国营工业宣传的内容，鼓舞人们改善现有国营工业的积极性。
    第三，要宣传现有国营工业在供给新工厂、新矿山以机器和各种装备，供给新工厂新矿山以干部和技术工人，积累发展新工业所需要的资金等方面的贡献。正如三月六日安徽日报所报道的，安徽地方工业几年来为工业和农业供应了各种机器和装备，如空气压缩机、抽水机、水车、轧花机，等等。最近两年来，仅一部分厂矿就为国家积累了一千多亿元的资金。可是，过去对于这方面的报道，不仅安徽日报，即其他许多报纸也是注意不够的。以比较注意这一宣传的旅大人民日报为例。该报在去年曾着重报道了“出机器、出人材”，支援全国重点建设的问题。报纸不仅报道了许多工厂试制新产品的成就和对全国重点建设的贡献，并且揭露了某些工厂干部认为试制新产品是“负担”、“附属品”、“拖一拖不要紧”等本位主义思想。同时，报纸也发表近三十篇的报道，反映培养和抽调干部的情况。其中如去年十二月四日、三十一日发表的关于大连机车车辆制造工厂等四个厂，大连起重机器厂等十三个厂的报道，就曾比较全面地反映了积极培养人材、输送优秀人材给全国各新工厂和新工业基地的情况，支援国家重点建设。供给新工厂、新矿山以机器和技术工人，这是现有国营工业帮助国家建设的责任，也是我们报纸报道的重要内容，因此，必须重视这一宣传。
    自然，旅大人民日报在这一方面的报道，并不是经常都作得很好的。据旅大人民日报的检查，还有许多支援国家重点建设的生动事例，报纸还没有报道。
    第四，宣传现有国营工业怎样完成满足人民对工业产品的需要的任务。在相当时间内，人民需要的工业产品，主要还是依靠于现有国营工业的供应。仍以安徽和旅大为例，国家和人民需要的许多工业品，都是由当地现有的国营工业直接供应的。如火车客车、水车、肥料、纺织品、家具、火柴，等等。但是，报纸却很少报道这些。如旅大人民日报在检查中说，近来地方国营工业有些产品的质量有显著改进，如珐琅器具、金笔、布、绒衬衣等，都受到群众欢迎，报纸却报道不多。这样就使人们从工业报道中看不出工业生产和他们切身的关系，得不到鼓舞的力量。
    最后，报纸还应适当注意宣传现有国营工业企业对非社会主义经济进行社会主义改造的领导作用。应该了解，为了完成我国社会主义工业化，必须对现有的资本主义工业和手工业进行社会主义改造。因此，这也是现有国营工业宣传中不可忽视的一个内容。
    深刻表达内容的主要方法
    了解了报道的内容以后，还必须注意宣传方法，否则，也不能表达出深刻的思想内容。宣传的方法有很多，但最能吸引当地人民群众积极参加改进现有工业和支援国家建设的方法，还是“用解释和说明从全国利益中引伸出来的当地群众的利益，用向当地人民提出具体地方任务的方法”。（一九二一年俄共（布）中央的决议：“关于地方报纸的纲领”）
    旅大人民日报在一九五三年的报道总结中就表明了这一点，即凡能从地方特点出发，说明国家重点建设对旅大现有国营工业的利益和人民群众的利益，说明现有国营工业对国家重点建设的作用，并指明支援国家重点建设是旅大人民的具体任务和努力方向，这样的报道就能起到鼓舞和动员群众的作用。反之，就不能或不能很好地起到这个作用。
    旅大人民日报去年九月十八日、十二月十二日发表的“工矿车辆厂积极完成鞍钢订货”和“从钢都来的货车”等报道，都是较好的报道。例如前一篇报道，一方面通过鞍钢供应大连工矿车辆厂生产六十吨翻底车、小机车、压路机等产品所需用的大部分钢材的事实，说明了国家重点建设对旅大现有国营工业的作用；另方面通过大连工矿车辆厂为鞍钢完成订货任务的事实，说明现有国营工业对国家工业化的作用。这就使职工群众从切身体验中具体地认识“鞍钢支援我们，我们支援鞍钢；支援鞍钢，就是支援全国”这一道理，从而积极地投入国家经济建设的热潮。报道中说：该厂工人在生产中体验到鞍钢供给的料质量好，硬软合适，干起活又快又好后，表示“一定要更好地支援鞍钢，使鞍钢生产的东西又好又多，使祖国早日工业化”。在经济建设中，像鞍钢重点建设对大连工矿车辆厂所发生的这种作用，并不只此一点，也不限于在这一个厂；同时，除鞍钢重点建设外，全国其他重点建设也在支援着旅大各现有国营工业企业，也在影响着人民经济生活。例如，旅大许多工厂用的大批生产原料如钢材、铸件，都是由鞍钢供应的；许多工厂扩建的设备，都是从全国各地国营机器制造厂供应的；许多工厂用的燃料，是从阜新、抚顺等煤矿供应的；大连石油厂用的石油原料，是从远在西北的玉门油矿供应的。这一切，都生动地说明全国重点建设对当地现有国营工业的作用，都可以生动地从全国利益中引伸出来说明当地群众的利益和工矿的利益，而吸引人民群众参加共同的政治经济生活中的建设工作。可是，在这一方面，正如旅大人民日报所检查的，由于过去指导思想不明确，就没有抓住这些生动的事例作突出的报道。
    报纸通过这些生动的事例，不仅可以教育全体人民认识国家社会主义工业化的极端重要的意义，认识它是全国人民的最高的利益，也是当地人民的切身利益；而且可以有力地反驳那些“工业化不重要”、“工业化对当地人民没啥利益”等等违反总路线的错误思想。通过各种具体事例宣传总路线，批判一切违反总路线的思想倾向，引导人们为实现总路线而奋斗，这正是党在过渡时期赋予党报的特殊使命。
    现有的工厂和工业基地的任务，主要就是供给新工厂和新工业基地以机器和各种设备，供给干部和技术工人，并积累发展新工业所需要的资金。因此，除了说明全国利益和当地具体利益而外，也还需要向当地人民提出具体的任务。例如，旅大现有工业的主要任务和特点，也正是供给重点建设以机器和人材。一九五二年中共旅大市委扩大会议曾指出：“旅大是解放较早、工业较有基础的城市，在大规模经济建设中，应担负起出机器、出干部、出熟练工人的任务。”旅大市委根据旅大特点向旅大人民所提出的具体地方任务，也正是旅大人民日报在现有国营工业的宣传中应该加以具体贯彻的。
    旅大人民日报一年来的实践证明，凡能通过典型事件，具体贯彻和体现这一中心思想的报道，就能在当地群众中发生比较深刻的影响。去年一月十七日报道的第七水泥厂试制高级水泥成功，和七、八、九月间连续报道的大连钢厂事件，便是两个比较突出的例子。前者通过水泥厂职工在知道了为鞍钢制造高级水泥后，如何克服困难，积极完成任务，保证了鞍钢某项重要工程需要的具体事实，宣传了现有的国营工厂对支援国家重点建设的意义和作用，并鼓舞了职工群众为支援国家重点建设而斗争的劳动热情。后者通过大连钢厂连续六个月没有完成国家计划，影响一百多个厂生产的典型事件，有力地说明了不办好现有的国营工业，就会使整个国家建设受到危害。正因为这一报道抓住了当地工业建设中一个典型的事件，所以取得很大的成效。不仅大连钢厂的负责干部作了检讨，就连大连电机厂等五个工厂的负责人员也联系这一事件在报纸上进行了检查。
    但因为支援国家重点建设的这一中心思想，没有系统地形成为报纸的指导思想，所以，像上述那样体现这一中心思想的报道，还是为数不多的。正如旅大人民日报在检查中所说，有不少报道往往是言不及义，说不到题目上来。
    这里只举一个例子来说明。去年，大连起重机器厂为治淮工程制造了大批运土车。因为质量不好，受到治淮民工的批评。该厂到工地修理的工人回厂向职工反映了治淮民工的意见，说明了由于他们制造的运土车质量不好，影响了伟大的治淮工程的情况，大家便积极地改善了质量。这是具体宣传工农联盟、工业支援农业的最鲜明而有说服力的事例。可是，报纸并没有抓住这些主要之点作突出的宣传，而只作了一般化的改进技术提高质量的报道。这就不能教育广大群众认识办好现有国营工业对国家对自己的关系，因而也就不能深刻地达到报纸宣传鼓动的成效。
    上述经验证明，根据地方特点，大量反映以取自当地为主的事实，通过这些事实，向当地人民说明全国重点建设对当地现有工业的作用，说明当地现有工业支援全国重点建设的作用，说明现有工业对满足人民生产生活需要的作用，并对忽视国家工业化和忽视充分利用现有国营工业的各种错误思想倾向进行斗争，是作好现有国营工业宣传、完成动员群众参加国家经济建设工作的重要方法。我们的省、市报纸特别是工业城市的报纸，都应该重视这个经验，并根据当地的特点，加强对现有国营工业的报道，并进一步提高报道的思想水平。
