Significant Development in Ethnic Minority Trade Work in the Southwest Region

    Over the past four years, the ethnic minority trade work in the Southwest region has seen significant development, promoting economic prosperity and improving the livelihoods of ethnic minority people in the region.

    In the southwest of our motherland live over ten million ethnic minority compatriots, distributed across the mountainous border areas of more than ten counties in Sichuan, the mountainous regions of Xikang, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Due to the reactionary rule of successive dynasties, especially the Kuomintang, compounded by the obstruction of high mountains and turbulent rivers, inconvenient transportation, and underdeveloped commerce, many areas lacked trade markets. The abundant local specialties had no outlet, and the tea, salt, cloth, and agricultural tools needed by the various ethnic groups were not supplied.

    With the liberation of the Southwest and the progress of ethnic work, state-owned ethnic commerce has gradually been established and grown stronger in ethnic minority areas. By the end of 1953, there were 500 ethnic trade organizations in the region, with over 5,700 employees, of whom ethnic minority cadres accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total number of employees. Ethnic trade companies have been established in county towns with relatively concentrated populations of ethnic minorities in Sichuan Province, and state-owned ethnic stores and purchasing and marketing groups have been set up in key valleys and villages. In Guizhou Province, ethnic trade organizations are located throughout the ethnic minority areas of the province. In the border areas of Yunnan, state-owned ethnic trade organizations more than doubled in 1953 compared to 1951. State-owned trade departments have also helped to establish and restore markets in these ethnic minority areas. The March Street in Dali County, Yunnan Province, was originally a market for the Tibetan, Lisu, Yi, Moxi, Hui, and Tujia ethnic groups in western Yunnan. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, ethnic minorities were afraid to go to the market, and it was deserted for many years, but it has now been restored.

    With the rapid development of state-owned ethnic trade, the economic landscape of ethnic minority areas is gradually changing. From 1951 to the end of 1953, the total sales of ethnic trade companies in ethnic minority areas reached over 1.3 trillion yuan. The supply in 1953 increased by more than two times compared to 1951, and the cloth, salt, and tea needed by the various ethnic groups were adequately supplied. In 1953 alone, ethnic minority compatriots throughout the region purchased 1.4 million bolts of homespun cloth and 340,000 dan of salt from ethnic trade companies. While supplying necessities, various places also strengthened the supply of agricultural tools, which are particularly needed for mountain production. Last year, Yunnan Province supplied 310,000 pieces of agricultural tools to farmers of various ethnic groups. From 1952 to September 1953, the Honghe area supplied more than 170,000 pieces of agricultural tools, which vigorously promoted the development of mountain production. The purchase volume in ethnic minority areas is also increasing year by year. From 1951 to the end of 1953, the total purchase volume of ethnic trade companies was over 1.09 trillion yuan, and the purchase volume in 1953 increased by more than three times compared to 1951. During the purchase process, various places paid special attention to the purchase of local specialties, opening up broad sales channels for the local specialties of various ethnic groups. For example, in Wangmo County, Guizhou, Rheum palmatum, which was previously burned as firewood due to lack of sales channels, as well as Tetrapanax papyriferus, Areca catechu, Broussonetia papyrifera, and Kapok which rotted on the mountains, now have sales channels. The income from minor local specialties alone can be exchanged for more than 1.7 million dan of salt per year, enough for the 110,000 people of various ethnic groups in the county to eat for two years. In the purchase of local specialties, various ethnic forms such as god-dancing festivals, exhibitions, and seminars were used to promote the production and processing of local specialties, and to guide the production of local specialties and improve specifications. In transactions, in addition to conscientiously implementing the policy of equivalent exchange, various places have also planned to lower the prices of industrial products and increase the prices of local specialties. In Leibo County, Sichuan Province, one dan of Gastrodia elata could be exchanged for 61 bolts of homespun cloth in 1951, but now it can be exchanged for 145 bolts. In the border areas of Yunnan, the prices of industrial products in 1953 were on average 8 to 12 percent lower than in 1952. In the Tibetan areas of Xikang, the ratio of Fritillaria cirrhosa exchanged for tea in 1953 increased by 98 percent compared to 1952. Now, people of all ethnic groups generally reflect: "We have bought things we couldn't buy before, and sold things we couldn't sell before," and "Ethnic trade companies are our own companies."

    In order to further develop ethnic trade work, the Southwest Commercial Bureau convened a Southwest Region Ethnic Trade Work Conference from March 1st to 13th this year, emphasizing that ethnic trade organizations at all levels should further strengthen the purchase of local specialties this year, while conducting in-depth investigations and research on the needs of various ethnic groups, vigorously supplying the goods they need and like, and helping ethnic minorities develop production and improve their lives.

    西南区少数民族贸易工作有显著发展
    四年来，西南区少数民族贸易工作有显著发展，促进了少数民族地区经济的繁荣和少数民族人民生活的改善。
    在祖国的西南，居住着一千多万少数民族同胞，他们分布在四川的十余县边沿山区，西康的山岳地带，和云贵高原。由于受历代皇室，特别是国民党的反动统治，高山急流的重重阻隔，交通不便，商业不发达，许多地区没有贸易集市，富饶的土特产没有销路，各族人民需要的茶叶、盐巴、布匹和农具无人供应。
    随着西南的解放，民族工作的进展，国营民族商业在少数民族地区也逐步建立和壮大起来。至一九五三年底，全区已有民族贸易机构五百个，职工五千七百余人，其中少数民族干部占职工总人数的近五分之一。在四川省各少数民族地区人口较集中的县城已设立了民族贸易公司，各重点沟、寨有国营民族商店和购销组；贵州省的民族贸易机构则遍及全省少数民族地区；云南边疆地区国营民族贸易机构一九五三年也较一九五一年增加了一倍半以上。国营贸易部门并在这些少数民族地区帮助建立和恢复了集市。云南省大理县三月街，原是云南西部藏、傈僳、彝、摩西、回、土家等民族的集市，国民党反动统治时期，少数民族不敢赶集，冷落多年，现已恢复。
    随着国营民族贸易的迅速发展，已逐渐改变着少数民族地区的经济面貌。一九五一年至一九五三年底民族贸易公司在少数民族地区的销货总额达一万三千余亿元，一九五三年供应量比一九五一年增加了两倍多，各族人民需要的布匹、盐巴、茶叶得到了适当的供应。仅一九五三年一年中，全区少数民族同胞就从民族贸易公司买到土布一百四十万匹，盐巴三十四万担。供应生活资料的同时，各地还加强了山区生产特别需要的农具的供应。云南省去年供应各族农民的农具达三十一万件，红洪区一九五二年至一九五三年九月供应农具十七万余件，有力地促进了山区生产的发展。在少数民族地区的收购量也是逐年增加的。民族贸易公司一九五一年至一九五三年底，收购总额共一万零九百多亿元，一九五三年收购量较一九五一年增加了三倍多，收购中各地特别注意了土特产品的收购，为各族人民的土特产品开辟了广阔的销路。如贵州望谟县过去因无销路当作柴烧的大黄草，霉烂在山上的通草、水槟榔、构皮、木棉等，都有了销路，木耳已行销广州、柳州等地。该县每年小土特产品的收入就能换到一百七十多万担盐巴，够全县十一万多各族人民吃两年。在收购土特产中利用各种民族形式的跳神会、展览会、座谈会等，进行土特产生产和加工的宣传，指导了土特产的生产，改进了规格。交易中各地除了认真贯彻等价交换政策外，并有计划地降低工业品价格提高土特产品价格。四川省雷波县的天麻一九五一年每担换土布六十一匹，现在可换一百四十五匹；云南边沿地区工业品价格一九五三年比一九五二年平均降低百分之八至十二；西康藏族区的贝母换茶比率一九五三年较一九五二年提高了百分之九十八。现在各族人民普遍反映：“我们买不到的东西买到了，卖不出去的东西卖掉了”，“民族贸易公司是我们自己的公司”。
    为了进一步开展民族贸易工作，西南商业局于今年三月一日至十三日召开了西南区民族贸易工作会议，着重要求各级民族贸易机构在今年内要进一步加强土特产的收购，同时深入调查研究各族人民的需要，大力供应为他们所需要和喜爱的货物，帮助少数民族发展生产，改善生活。
