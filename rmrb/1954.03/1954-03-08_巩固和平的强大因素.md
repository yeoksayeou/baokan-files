    A Powerful Factor in Consolidating Peace
    Soviet Union, G. Astafayev
    The characteristic of the current international situation is that an increasingly broad range of people in all countries are demanding effective measures to ease international tensions, improve relations between major powers, and consolidate peace and security.
    The people of all countries know that only the joint efforts of the five major powers can guarantee the easing of international tensions and the achievement of agreements on important international issues. From this point of view, the Soviet Union has consistently believed, and still believes, that it is impossible to resolve important issues concerning Asia—and not only Asia—without the participation of the People's Republic of China.
    The participation of People's China in resolving important international issues contributes to the easing of international tensions. The short-sighted American policy, which goes against common sense, of ignoring and fundamentally obliterating the rights and interests of the great five hundred million Chinese people, cannot promote the elimination of international tensions. Now, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has become an independent and sovereign country, gaining recognition and prestige among the people of Asia and the world, and has become—whether the United States likes it or not—a true great power. Without its participation, the solution of fundamental international issues is inconceivable. The United States refuses to recognize the legitimate rights of the great Chinese people, attempting to ignore historical changes, forgetting that China has gained national independence and has become a strong and unified country. The era of foreigners dominating China's destiny is long gone.
    If China played an extremely important role in world politics for many centuries, then now the People's Republic of China has become an important factor in developing international economic and political relations and safeguarding peace and universal security.
    In the past, the struggle for hegemony in China among foreign powers created an extremely tense political situation in the Far East. The focus of their contradictions in China often became a potential breeding ground for war. It was precisely here, in 1937, that the flames of World War II were first ignited.
    At the same time, in China, despite the conspiracies and death throes of the colonialists and domestic anti-people groups, the powerful people's liberation movement led by the Communist Party continued to consolidate and develop year after year. The victory of the Soviet Union in World War II and the defeat of Japanese militarism with the active participation of the Chinese people promoted a tremendous surge in this movement. The Chinese people achieved a great historical victory in the fierce struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which plotted to completely sell China out to foreign imperialism.
    Today, for the first time in its thousands of years of history, China appears before the world as a unified, independent, and sovereign country with a democratic central government.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China represents the entire Chinese people, and its entire policy enjoys unanimous support throughout the country. It is this situation that has made it possible for the Central People's Government of China to achieve tremendous achievements in the political, economic, and cultural fields in a short historical period: unifying the country, building solid local governments, implementing land reform, stabilizing and unifying the monetary system, achieving budget balance, completing the restoration of the national economy, which had been devastated by war, within three years, and beginning the implementation of large-scale plans for national industrialization, and embarking on genuine democratic general elections at all levels of government across the country.
    These achievements of New China have determined its status as a great power and have determined its great influence on the development of affairs in Asia and even the whole world.
    The leaders of many countries now clearly understand the international role of the People's Republic of China as a great power. Indian Prime Minister Nehru justly pointed out in a speech in London on June 12, 1953: "The emergence of a 'powerful, unified, and united China' has become one of the determining factors in modern life." In a speech at a meeting in Madras on October 2, 1953, Nehru said:
  "Does anyone doubt the existence of such a China? It has a strong central government. It is not a question of whether you like it or not. The fact is that this great power exists there, and its rule extends throughout the vast territory."
    The existence of People's China affects the international relations of Asia and the world. To ignore this fact is to attempt to develop current international relations in a distorted direction, that is, to attempt to create a source of international tension.
    The people of Asia warmly congratulate the appearance of a strong and independent China on the international stage. Even the American press has had to admit this. For example, American journalist Mark Gayn wrote in "The New Republic" magazine in September 1953: "Indians understand its relationship with China, because both nations have suffered from Western imperialism in the past... Indians praise China's social and economic achievements... Indians celebrate this Asian country's rise to the status of a great power."
    The most important demand in current world politics is the demand to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    The entire peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, unswervingly defends the legitimate rights of the great people's country—China. Representatives of Asian countries advocate satisfying this demand.
    Indian representative Menon said at the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly:
  "The Chinese government... is a unified government capable of fulfilling the obligations stipulated in the current charter, and it has the right to send representatives and should send representatives here as a unified government."
    British business people, many officials in Britain, France, and other Western European countries, have also expressed the same view.
    An important feature of the current political situation is that the People's Republic of China has established genuinely friendly and peaceful relations with all its neighbors. This has changed international relations in Asia. To illustrate this relationship, we can mention the fact that when the United States tried its best to get the United Nations to pass the shameful and illegal resolution declaring the People's Republic of China as an "aggressor" in 1951, twelve Asian countries spoke out in strong opposition. Later, this resolution was passed only because of a series of behind-the-scenes activities and crude pressure by the United States on countries receiving "American aid."
    The relations between People's China and various countries in Asia and Europe are being increasingly consolidated and are developing smoothly. Now, the People's Republic of China has diplomatic relations with many countries, large and small.
    Due to the deterioration of world trade and the increase in competition in the world market, the industrial and commercial circles of Asian countries are increasingly insisting on finding ways to restore and strengthen trade relations with China, despite the "embargo" (prohibition of trade with China). The People's Republic of China, which never implements discriminatory policies, is very happy to welcome them under the conditions of conducting trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In 1952 and 1953, in addition to expanding trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the Chinese government also established trade relations with India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia in Asia. Trade with China is of great significance to these countries, because it reduces their dependence on American monopoly capital and makes it possible for them to demand higher product prices (the United States has used its position as a monopoly buyer to reduce these prices to extremely low levels). Therefore, these countries are increasingly expanding trade with China despite the tyrannical oppression of the United States. Even the industrial and commercial circles in Malaya, Thailand, and the Philippines are eagerly demanding the establishment of trade relations with China. In Malaya, the demand to restore trade with China has been formally put forward by the Legislative Council.
    The Japanese Diet has passed a resolution demanding the development of trade with the People's Republic of China. In October 1953, a delegation organized by Japanese parliamentarians visited China. This delegation signed a trade agreement in Beijing for the exchange of 30 million pounds worth of goods between China and Japan.
    Recently, an Egyptian business delegation also visited China. Their trip was to explore the possibility of expanding the sale of Egyptian cotton in China.
    The facts show that trade between Western European countries and China is indispensable to their economies. The growth of crisis phenomena in Western European countries is forcing representatives of the business community in these countries, despite the notorious "embargo" imposed on them by American reactionaries, to increasingly insist on seeking to establish trade relations with the People's Republic of China.
    Among the Western European countries, those that trade with the People's Republic of China include Britain, Italy, West Germany, France, and other countries. In 1953, delegations sent by the British and French business communities visited China. The British delegation signed a trade agreement with China for a total value of 30 million pounds each.
    China's cultural ties with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are increasingly consolidated and developed. The mutual visits of delegations from the Sino-Indian Friendship Association and the India-China Friendship Association, and the wide-ranging development of the activities of the two associations, show that the relations and friendship between these two great nations are becoming increasingly consolidated. China's cultural ties with other countries are also being established and continuously expanded.
    The development of trade and cultural ties between the People's Republic of China and Western European and Asian countries is conducive to mutual understanding and the improvement of international relations. This vividly demonstrates the bankruptcy of the policies of blockade, embargo, and non-recognition. This fact once again proves that the People's Republic of China not only gains tremendous political prestige on the international stage, but also has a pivotal influence on economic and cultural relations between countries.

    Today, without the participation of great China, it is impossible to smoothly solve any major international problem, and it is even more impossible to ease international tensions. The foreign ministers of France, Britain, and the United States have also had to indirectly acknowledge this, recognizing that it is possible and necessary to discuss Asian issues, especially the Korean and Indochinese issues, jointly with the People's Republic of China.
    The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference of the five major powers has received such a wide response and approval around the world that Western countries have found it impossible to completely reject it. The purpose of the Soviet proposal is to correct the current abnormal relationship: some countries have ignored the fundamental changes that have taken place in Asia, marked by the founding of the great People's Republic of China. After long discussions, the representatives of the Western countries at the Berlin Conference had to agree to convene a conference in Geneva with the participation of the People's Republic of China. There is no doubt that the convening of this conference will help ease international tensions and help eliminate the difficulties in resolving the Korean issue and restoring peace in Indochina. The convening of this conference is conducive to peace and international security.

    巩固和平的强大因素
    苏联　格·阿斯塔费耶夫
    目前国际形势的特点是，世界各国愈来愈广泛的社会人士，要求采取有效的措施来缓和国际紧张局势，改善各大国之间的相互关系，以巩固和平与安全。
    世界各国人民知道，只有五大国共同努力，才能保证国际紧张局势的缓和，并在重要的国际问题上达成协议。从这一点出发，苏联曾经坚决认为并仍然认为，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加，就不可能解决有关亚洲——而且不仅是亚洲——的重要问题。
    人民中国的参加解决重要的国际问题，有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。目光短浅的、违背常识的美国政策对于伟大的五亿中国人民的权利和利益的忽视和根本抹杀，是不能促进国际紧张局势的消除。现在，在中华人民共和国成立以后，中国已成了一个独立自主的国家，在亚洲人民与全世界人民中间获得了承认和威信，并成为——不管美国愿意不愿意——一个真正的大国。没有它的参加，带有根本性的国际问题的解决是不能设想的。美国拒不承认伟大的中国人民的合法权利，企图忽视历史性的变化，忘记中国已经得到了民族独立和已成为一个强大的统一的国家的事实。今天外国人支配中国命运的时代是早已一去不复返了。
    如果过去许多世纪以来中国在世界政治中起过极其重要的作用，那么现在中华人民共和国则已成为发展国际经济与政治关系、维护和平与普遍安全的重要因素了。
    过去外国列强争夺在中国霸权的斗争，曾造成远东的极度紧张的政治形势。它们在中国的矛盾的焦点，往往成为战争的潜在的温床。正是在这里，在一九三七年首先点燃了第二次世界大战的火焰。
    与此同时，在中国尽管殖民者和国内反人民集团进行种种阴谋和垂死挣扎，共产党所领导的强大的人民解放运动仍是年复一年地巩固和发展了。苏联在第二次世界大战中的胜利以及在中国人民积极参加下日本军国主义的被打败，推进了这一运动的巨大高涨。中国人民在反对图谋使中国完全卖身投靠于外国帝国主义的蒋介石集团的残酷斗争中取得了伟大的历史性的胜利。
    今天，中国在其数千年历史上第一次作为一个有着民主的中央政府的、统一、独立和自主的国家出现在全世界的面前。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表着全体中国人民，它的全部政策获得举国一致的支持。正是这种情况使得中国的中央人民政府有可能在短短的历史时期内在政治、经济和文化领域中取得了巨大的成就：统一了国家，建设了巩固的地方政权，实行了土地改革，稳定和统一了货币制度，达到了预算平衡，在三年内完成了历遭战争浩劫的国民经济的恢复工作，开始执行国家工业化的大规模的计划以及在全国范围内着手进行各级政权机构的真正的民主普选。
    新中国的这些成就决定了它的大国的地位，并且决定了它对亚洲乃至全世界事务发展的巨大影响。
    许多国家的领袖现在都已清楚地懂得中华人民共和国作为一个大国的国际作用。印度总理尼赫鲁一九五三年六月十二日曾在伦敦的一次演说中公正地指出：“强大的、统一的、团结的中国”的出现已成为现代生活中的决定因素之一了。在一九五三年十月二日尼赫鲁在马德拉斯集会上的演说称：
  “难道还有人怀疑有这样的一个中国的存在吗？它有一个强有力的中央政府。这不是你喜欢它不喜欢它的问题。事实是这个大国是存在在那里，它的统治遍及整个广大的国土。”
    人民中国的存在影响到亚洲和世界的国际关系，忽视这个事实，就是企图使目前的国际关系朝着畸形的方向发展，也就是企图造成国际气氛紧张的源泉。
    亚洲人民热烈地祝贺强大的和独立的中国出现在国际舞台上。甚至美国报刊也不得不承认这一点。例如，美国记者马克·费尔一九五三年九月在
  “新共和”杂志上写道：“印度人理解它和中国的关系，因为过去这两个民族都吃过西方帝国主义的苦头……印度人赞扬中国的社会和经济成就……印度人庆贺这个亚洲国家上升到大国的地位”。
    当前世界政治中最重要的要求，就是要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营，不屈不挠地维护伟大的人民国家——中国的合法权利。亚洲国家的代表们主张满足这种要求。
    印度的代表梅农在第七届联合国大会上说过：
  “中国政府……是有能力履行目前宪章规定的义务的统一的政府，是有权利派代表和应该派代表到这里的统一的政府。”
    英国的商界人士，英国、法国及其他西欧国家的许多官方人士，也表示了同样的主张。
    目前政治局势的重要特点是，中华人民共和国已和它的所有的邻国建立了真正友好和平的关系。这就改变了亚洲的国际关系。为了说明这种关系，可以提一下这个事实，当一九五一年美国竭力要使联合国通过宣布中华人民共和国为“侵略者”的这个可耻的和非法的决议时，有十二个亚洲国家发言表示坚决反对。后来只是由于美国对接受“美援”的国家进行了一系列的幕后活动和粗暴压力，这个决议才得以通过。
    人民中国及亚洲和欧洲各国的关系正在日益巩固和顺利发展着。现在，中华人民共和国与许多大小国家都有着外交关系。
    由于世界贸易情况的恶化和世界市场上竞争的增长，亚洲各国工商业界不顾“禁运”（禁止与中国贸易），日益坚持地努力寻找与中国恢复和加强贸易关系的道路。绝不实行歧视政策的中华人民共和国，在以平等互利为基础进行贸易的条件下，非常高兴地欢迎他们。在一九五二年和一九五三年中，中国政府除了扩展了与苏联和各人民民主国家贸易之外，并与亚洲的印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、锡兰和印度尼西亚等国建立了贸易关系。这些国家与中国进行贸易，对于它们有着重大的意义。因为这样就减轻了它们对美国垄断资本的依赖，并使他们提高产品价格的要求成为可能（美国曾利用自己的垄断购买人的地位，把这种价格减到极低的水平）。所以，这些国家不顾美国的横暴压迫，日益扩展与中国的贸易。甚至马来亚、泰国和菲律宾的工商界，也迫切地要求与中国建立贸易关系。在马来亚，与中国恢复贸易的要求，已被立法委员会正式提出。
    日本国会曾通过了要求发展与中华人民共和国的贸易的决议。一九五三年十月，由日本议员所组织的代表团曾访问了中国。这个代表团在北京签订了中日双方换货三千万英镑的贸易协议。
    最近，埃及商务代表团也访问了中国。他们此行是为了了解扩大埃及棉花在中国销售的可能性。
    事实表明：西欧各国与中国进行贸易，在它们的经济上是不可缺少的。西欧各国中危机现象的增长，迫使这些国家的商界代表人物，不顾美国反动派强加于他们的臭名昭著的“禁运”，日益坚持地寻求与中华人民共和国建立贸易关系。
    在西欧国家中，和中华人民共和国进行贸易的有英国、意大利、西德、法国及其他国家。一九五三年访问中国的有英国和法国商界派遣的代表团。英国代表团和中国签订了双方总额各达三千万英镑的贸易协议。
    中国与苏联及人民民主国家的文化联系日益巩固和发展。中印友好协会和印中友好协会代表团的互相访问，两个协会的活动的广泛展开，说明了这两个伟大民族的关系和友谊正日趋巩固。中国和其他国家的文化联系也在建立中和不断扩大中。
    中华人民共和国与西欧及亚洲国家贸易、文化联系的发展，是有助于相互谅解和改善国际关系的。这就鲜明地表明封锁、禁运和不承认政策的破产。这个事实再一次证明：中华人民共和国不仅在国际舞台上获得巨大的政治威望，而且在各国人民间经济及文化关系方面也有举足轻重的影响。
              ×　　　×　　　×
    今天，没有伟大中国的参与，就不可能顺利地解决任何重大国际问题，当然更不可能缓和国际紧张局势了。法、英、美三国外交部部长也不得不间接承认这一点，他们承认了和中华人民共和国共同讨论亚洲、特别是朝鲜及印度支那问题是可能的和必要的。
    苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议在全世界得到了如此广泛的响应和赞同，以致西方国家认为不可能完全加以拒绝。苏联建议的目的是纠正目前的这种不正常关系：某些国家忽视了在亚洲发生的、以伟大的中华人民共和国的成立为标志的根本变化。经过长期讨论后，西方国家的代表在柏林会议上不得不同意在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议。毫无疑问，这个会议的召开会有助于缓和国际紧张局势，有助于消除在解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题方面的困难。这个会议的召开是有利于和平及国际安全的。
