　　Newspaper Review

　　Labor Achievement Symposium
　　Various localities are actively conducting education on the General Line for the broad masses of workers. To deepen this education, newspapers have a responsibility to promptly report and promote all good experiences in publicity and education. The Shanxi Daily's coverage of the Labor Achievement Symposium is a noteworthy example.

　　On January 23, the newspaper reported on the Labor Achievement Symposium held by the Fourth Workshop of State-owned Factory 145. The symposium was convened after a series of preparations. Leading cadres of the workshop first studied the workers' ideological types in detail, helped them summarize advanced ideas, and organized propaganda teams to cooperate through individual conversations, group deliberations, and publicity to family members. The symposium covered five topics: (1) Discuss the achievements and experiences of the past year. (2) Examine existing shortcomings in the spirit of the General Line. (3) Define ideological boundaries. Clarify what ideas should be established and what ideas should be opposed to realize the national General Line. (4) Look at the prospects of socialism, recall the changes in the past four years in personal, factory, and national aspects, and see what socialist Soviet Union is like. (5) Under the illumination of the General Line, find the direction for future efforts. The newspaper pointed out that this symposium was a new creation that closely combined the publicity of the General Line and General Task with the workers' current labor and thinking, thereby enhancing the workers' socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm. Indeed, this was the case. After the symposium, Bai Shikai, who had been unwilling to teach his electric saw grinding skills to others for three years, realized that socialist construction requires many technical talents and decided to impart his skills and teach his apprentices well. All production teams in the workshop also launched enthusiastic labor competitions, guaranteeing to comprehensively, evenly, safely, and over-fulfill the state plan and realize the national General Line. Promptly discovering and promoting various lively ways of publicizing the General Line, and fully publicizing its significance and role, is an aspect that newspapers should not neglect in going deep into reality and deep into the General Line publicity.

　　In the editorial on the same day, the Shanxi Daily pointed out that the publicity and education work of the General Line in many factories and mines is generally not linked to the actual thinking of the employees, and therefore cannot achieve the due publicity effect. However, holding a Labor Achievement Symposium can inspire workers to educate themselves with concrete facts from their own experiences, and through recalling and comparing these five symposium contents, guide workers to connect daily labor with the goal of socialist industrialization, and connect the national General Line with the real life of the working masses, turning it into a huge material force. Therefore, the editorial issued a call to factories and mining enterprises throughout the province: they should flexibly use this method according to their own specific circumstances, and continue to create various lively and powerful publicity methods, and lead the education of the General Line to a climax in the short term. Through its important voice, the newspaper supported the new creations and new experiences of the masses, placed it in a more important position in real life, and promoted everyone to pay attention and promote it.

　　However, for more than a month, the Shanxi Daily has not continued to report on the issues in promoting this experience, and organized the promotion of this experience. This is an issue that should be paid special attention to in the future. Because the responsibility of the newspaper is not only to discover and publicize the budding creations and advanced experiences of the masses, but also to strive to organize and promote it into the wealth of the broad masses.

### 劳动成果座谈会

    劳动成果座谈会
    各地正积极向广大工人群众进行总路线的教育。为了使这一教育深入开展，报纸就有责任将宣传教育中的一切好的经验及时地报道出来，加以推广。山西日报关于劳动成果座谈会的宣传，是值得注意的一个例子。
    该报在一月二十三日报道了国营一四五厂第四车间举办劳动成果座谈会的消息。座谈会是经过一系列的准备工作才召开的。车间领导干部事先详细研究了工人的思想类型，帮助他们总结了先进思想；又组织宣传队伍，用个别谈话、小组酝酿、向家属进行宣传等活动作了配合。座谈的内容共五项：（一）谈一谈一年来的成绩和经验。（二）以总路线的精神查一查存在的缺点。（三）划一划思想界限。明确实现国家总路线应该树立什么思想，反对什么思想。（四）看一看社会主义前途，回想一下四年来个人、厂内、全国等方面的变化，再看看社会主义苏联是个啥样。（五）在总路线这一灯塔照耀下，找一找今后努力的方向。报纸指出：这个座谈会是把总路线总任务的宣传和工人当前的劳动、思想紧密结合起来，从而提高工人的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情的一个新创造。事实也的确如此。举行了座谈会后，三年来一直不肯将磨电锯的技术教给别人的白士凯，认识到建设社会主义需要很多技术人材，便决心要传授自己的技术，教好徒弟。全车间的各个生产小组，也普遍展开热烈的劳动竞赛，保证要全面、均衡、安全、超额地完成国家计划，实现国家总路线。及时地发现和推广宣传总路线的各种新鲜活泼的方式，并且充分宣传它的意义和作用，这是报纸在深入实际、深入总路线宣传中的一个不可忽视的方面。
    山西日报在同日的社论中指出：许多厂矿中总路线的宣传教育工作，一般还没有和职工的思想实际联系起来，因此不能收到应有的宣传效果。而举办劳动成果座谈会，则能启发工人用亲身经历的具体事实来教育自己，并且通过回忆、对比这五项座谈内容，引导工人把日常劳动和社会主义工业化的目标联系起来，把国家总路线和工人群众的现实生活血肉不可分地联系起来，变成巨大的物质力量。因此社论向全省的厂矿企业发出号召：应该根据自己的具体情况灵活运用这一方式，和继续创造多种多样生动有力的宣传方式，在短期内把总路线的教育引向高潮。报纸通过自己重要的言论力量，支持了群众中的新创造新经验，把它放在现实生活中更重要的位置上，推动大家加以重视和推广。
    可是，山西日报一个多月来还没有针对推广这个经验中的问题，继续进行报道，并组织这一经验的推广工作。这是今后应特别注意的问题。因为，报纸的责任，不仅要发现、宣传群众中萌芽的创造和先进经验，而且要努力组织和推广它变成为广大群众的财富。（张浅）
