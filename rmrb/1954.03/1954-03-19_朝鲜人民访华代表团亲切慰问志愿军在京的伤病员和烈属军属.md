Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: A portion of the Korean People's Delegation to China, led by head of delegation Kim Ung-gi and deputy heads of delegation Kim Dal-hyun and Lee Young-ho, visited an army hospital and the Peking Union Medical College Hospital on the morning of the 18th to comfort wounded and sick Chinese People's Volunteers who had returned to China for recuperation. The delegation representatives were warmly welcomed and cordially received in both locations.

In his message of condolence, delegation head Kim Ung-gi said, "The Korean people will never forget the heroic feats performed by the valiant Chinese People's Volunteers in the war to liberate our motherland. You defended the people of our motherland with your own blood. All the Korean people regard your wounds as their own and sincerely wish you a speedy recovery." The wounded and sick responded with enthusiastic applause.

Zhang Zaitian, political commissar of a certain army hospital, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of all the wounded and sick, saying, "The heroic spirit shown by the heroic Korean people in the great struggle against American imperialist aggression, and the fearless spirit and determination shown in economic recovery after the armistice, have infinitely encouraged us. Many of the convalescents and staff in our hospital participated directly in the Korean people's war against American imperialist aggression. Therefore, the arrival of the delegation today makes us doubly excited." Cui Jianguo, a special-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, replied on behalf of the wounded and sick, saying, "We will recuperate well and strive to recover our health as soon as possible, return to our posts, and study hard the general line of our country during the transition period, improve our awareness, and defend our socialist construction, defend peace in the Far East and the world, to thank you and, through you, thank all the Korean people for your warm concern."

Delegation members went to the wards and shook hands with the wounded and sick one by one. When delegation head Kim Ung-gi presented flowers to Du Chaozhen, a second-class meritorious service member of the Chinese People's Volunteers, he also made a brief speech.

Among the representatives visiting were Jang Hyun-hwa, a combat hero of the Korean People's Army, and Choi Bun-ok, a female tank driver. They chatted cordially with Cui Jianguo, a special-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and other female comrades for about half an hour. Cui Jianguo mentioned that he had performed missions on Highland 1421, which was guarded by Jang Hyun-hwa, and both were filled with the laughter of victors. They both took out notebooks to sign for each other as souvenirs.

The representatives and the wounded and sick were reluctant to part when they said goodbye. Delegation head Kim Ung-gi wrote an inscription on a piece of green satin. He wrote: "The Chinese People's Volunteers marched thousands of miles to our motherland and showed unparalleled perseverance in the severe winter snow and under the hail of bullets, and were wounded in stubborn battles, which makes us very sad. Thanks to the joint battle of you and the Korean People's Army, the war ended victoriously. We wish you an early recovery and to participate in the socialist construction of your great motherland."

Xinhua News Agency: On the 18th, representatives of the Korean People's Delegation to China comforted the families of martyrs and military personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Beijing. The consolation meeting was held at Zhongshan Hall. Deputy heads of the delegation Baek Nam-un and Lee Dong-young, representatives Seo Young-hee, Park Chan-soo, Goo Bu-ryuk, Choi Hye and other thirteen people attended the consolation meeting. More than 400 families of martyrs and military personnel of the Volunteers participated in the meeting, including Guo Dama, Jia Lanwen, Bai Yuzhen, Wang Wenru and other model military families of the Volunteers.

Zeng Zhaolun, vice chairman of the Beijing Anti-American Aid Korea Branch, delivered the opening speech.

Then, deputy head of the delegation Baek Nam-un delivered a message of condolence. He extended cordial greetings to the families of the martyrs and military personnel of the Volunteers who sent their loved ones to the front lines in Korea. He said: When we were in the most difficult time, the Chinese people not only gave moral and material support, but also supported us with the blood of your most beloved people, ensuring our victory. The feats established by your sons, husbands and brothers on the land of Korea will be passed down for generations in the hearts of the Korean people. We will cherish this precious friendship as we cherish our own eyes.

Model military family member Jia Lanwen delivered a reply. She expressed the welcome of the families of martyrs and military personnel of the Volunteers in Beijing to the Korean People's Delegation to China, and expressed sincere gratitude for their condolences.

At the meeting, families of martyrs and military personnel of the Volunteers and representatives presented flowers to each other. They shook hands warmly, and the mothers of Korea and the mothers of China embraced each other with tears in their eyes. Prolonged applause rang out in the hall.
