    Second Year of North Fei River Drainage Project Begins
    The second year of the North Fei River Drainage Project, a drainage and irrigation demonstration project in the Huai River basin, has recently commenced. Participating in this project are 53,000 laborers from Suixi, Huaiyuan, and Wuhe counties, as well as the Anhui Provincial Labor Engineering Corps. The first half of the project will conclude by the end of May, and a total of over 6.6 million cubic meters of earthwork for river management, drainage, control, and transportation will be completed. Prior to the commencement, in terms of financial supply work, a total of eighteen grain and grass supply stations were established, and over ten million jin of rice and over four million jin of coal were transferred. In terms of equipment, in addition to the transfer of a large number of baskets, shovels, and spades, many special tools have also been prepared to ensure the smooth progress of the project.
    The North Fei River area of Anhui Province is one of the most severely waterlogged areas along the Huai River. In order to fundamentally eliminate this disaster, and to gain experience to facilitate large-scale drainage projects in the Huai River basin in the future, the Huai River Governance Committee has specially organized a key demonstration project of drainage and irrigation in the North Fei River. The first year of the project started in April last year and ended in late January this year. A total of over 185,000 laborers participated in the construction, completing over 10 million cubic meters of earthwork, ensuring that more than 700,000 mu of land are no longer flooded. After the completion of this year's project, the land within an area of over 11 million square kilometers in the Suixi, Suxian, Huaiyuan, and Wuhe counties in the Xie River, Da Hong Gou, and Yanwo Da Gou basins will be basically free from waterlogging disasters even in the event of heavy rain.

    北淝河排涝工程第二年度工程开工
    淮河流域排涝灌溉示范工程——北淝河排涝工程第二年度工程已于最近开工，参加这项工程的有濉溪、怀远、五河三县民工及安徽省劳动工程总队共五万三千多人，上半年工程将在五月底结束，共要完成治河、排涝、控制、交通等项六百六十多万公方土的工程。开工前，在财务供应工作方面，共建立了十八个粮草供应站，调运了一千多万斤大米和四百多万斤煤。器材上除调运了大批的筐、锹和铣等外，并准备了许多特种工具，保证了工程的顺利进行。
    安徽省北淝河一带是沿淮内涝较重地区之一，为了根治这一灾害，并吸取经验，便于将来在淮河流域进行大规模排涝工程，治淮委员会特在北淝河举办排涝灌溉重点示范工程。第一年度工程从去年四月开始，到今年一月下旬结束，参加施工的民工共达十八万五千多人，完成土工一千多万公方，保证了七十多万亩土地不再受淹。今年工程完成后，将使懈河、大洪沟、沿涡大沟流域的濉溪、宿县、怀远、五河四县境内一千一百多万平方公里面积内的土地，碰到暴雨时，仍可基本上解除内涝灾害。
