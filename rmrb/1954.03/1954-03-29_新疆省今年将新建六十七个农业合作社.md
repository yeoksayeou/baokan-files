    Xinjiang Province will establish sixty-seven new agricultural producers' cooperatives this year, based on the specific circumstances of mutual aid and cooperation development in various regions. Before the spring plowing, fifty-four cooperatives can be established in agricultural areas with a relatively good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, and thirteen more can be established after the autumn harvest.
    The land reform in Xinjiang Province's agricultural areas has been successfully completed, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also laid a certain foundation, and Party and Youth League organizations have been established. Many areas already possess the basic conditions for establishing cooperatives. The local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party in various regions have successively convened joint meetings of county Party secretaries and county heads to convey and study instructions and documents related to the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and have held training classes for cooperative establishment cadres. About four hundred cooperative establishment cadres have been trained throughout the province. Various regions have also determined that leading comrades from the regional and county Party committees will be specifically responsible for leading the cooperative establishment work. The CPC Urumqi Regional Committee has determined that Zhang Shigong, the regional Party secretary, will specifically lead the cooperative establishment work in the region, and has specifically stipulated that in addition to the county Party secretary or deputy secretary personally leading the cooperative establishment work in each county, stronger department heads or district Party secretaries and stronger working cadres should be selected to live in the cooperative establishment areas for a long time and persist in all cooperative establishment work. The CPC South Xinjiang Regional Committee, Kashgar Regional Committee, and Yanqi Regional Committee have all organized work teams to directly lead the cooperative establishment work. The CPC Xinjiang Branch has also sent a work team to Turpan County to pilot cooperative establishment work in order to gain cooperative establishment experience.
    The targets selected for establishing cooperatives in various regions are mutual aid groups with a good mutual aid foundation, some accumulated public property, and strong leading backbone members. The eleven mutual aid groups selected for cooperative establishment in the Ili region have twelve new-style plows, two horse-drawn harvesters, two horse-drawn seeders, one corn threshing machine, and four seed drills. Among them, nine mutual aid groups have seven Communist Party members, three Youth League members, and ten labor models. At present, various regions are actively carrying out various tasks for establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    新疆省今年将新建六十七个农业合作社
    新疆省根据各地互助合作发展的具体情况，今年将新建六十七个农业生产合作社。春耕前，全省可在互助合作运动基础较好的农业地区建立起五十四个社，秋后还可再建立十三个社。
    新疆省农业地区的土地改革已胜利完成，互助合作运动也有了一定的基础，并建立了党、团组织，许多地区都已具备了建社的基本条件。各地中共地委都先后召开了县委书记和县长联席会议，传达和研究了有关建立农业生产合作社的指示和文件，并举办了建社干部训练班，全省大约训练了四百名建社干部。各地还都确定了由地委、县委负责同志专门领导建社工作。中共乌鲁木齐地委确定地委书记张世功同志专门领导该专区的建社工作，并具体规定各县的建社工作除由县委书记或副书记亲自领导外，还要选派较强的部长或区委书记与较强的工作干部长期地住在建社地区，坚持全部建社工作。中共南疆区党委、喀什地委、焉耆地委都已组织工作组直接领导建社工作，中共新疆分局也派工作组到吐鲁番县试办建社工作，以便取得建社经验。
    各地选择建社的对象都是互助基础较好、积累了一些公有财产和领导骨干较强的互助组，伊犁专区所选择的十一个建社互助组，就有十二架新式犁、两架马拉收割机、两架马拉播种机、一架包谷脱粒机和四架摆耧，其中九个互助组就有七名共产党员，三名团员和十名劳动模范。目前，各地正在积极进行建立农业生产合作社的各项工作。
