Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, Laos, March 3rd: According to a Laotian News Agency report from Laos on the 2nd, the Laotian Resistance Government announced that the Lao People's Liberation Army annihilated and routed nearly all enemy forces in Phong Saly Province in northern Laos from February 19th to 24th, liberating the provincial capital of Phong Saly Province and nearly all of the province's territory. Phong Saly Province is a large province in northern Laos bordering Vietnam and China.

The communique stated that the Lao People's Liberation Army launched the offensive on Phong Saly with two columns advancing. The first column started from the northern part of the Muang Xai region, rapidly advancing north and encircling the enemy forces stationed at Ban Tai, 40 kilometers southwest of the provincial capital of Phong Saly. Under the severe threat of the Lao People's Liberation Army, the enemy forces had no choice but to withdraw from Ban Tai on February 19th and flee north. The Lao People's Liberation Army immediately pursued, catching up with the enemy forces the next day, forcing the majority of the enemy to surrender and capturing the enemy commander, Lieutenant Renault.

At the same time, the second column, starting from Muang Khoua, advanced towards the provincial capital of Phong Saly. The enemy forces defending Phong Saly panicked upon hearing the news on the afternoon of February 23rd and abandoned the city, fleeing north. At 10:00 PM that evening, the Lao People's Liberation Army entered the provincial capital of Phong Saly and pursued the fleeing enemy. At 8:00 AM on February 24th, the Lao People's Liberation Army caught up with the enemy forces 18 kilometers from Phong Saly, annihilating nearly all of the fleeing enemy, including killing the enemy commander, Lieutenant Richaud, and capturing Lieutenant Deroist and Lieutenant Rio, as well as many French officers. Currently, the remaining enemy are surrendering to the Lao People's Liberation Army in droves.

The communique continued, saying that the Lao People's Liberation Army was warmly welcomed by the residents along the way and in the provincial capital of Phong Saly during their advance.

The communique concluded by pointing out that this victory is another major victory for the Lao People's Liberation Army this spring, following continuous victories in the Nam Ou River basin in northern Laos, Highway 9 in central Laos, and the Bolovens Plateau in southern Laos.

    寮国解放军解放封萨里省大部分
    歼灭和击溃了封萨里省将近全部的敌军
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社寮国二日讯：寮国抗战政府发表的公报说，寮国人民解放军在二月十九日至二十四日歼灭和击溃了寮国北部封萨里省的将近全部的敌军，解放了封萨里省省会和该省的将近全部的土地。封萨里省是寮国北部与越南和中国接连的一个大省份。
    公报说，寮国人民解放军向封萨里发动的进攻是分两路纵队推进的。第一路纵队从芒塞地区的北部出发，迅速地向北推进并包围了驻扎在封萨里省省会西南四十公里邦太的敌军。敌军在寮国人民解放军的严重威胁下，不得不于二月十九日从邦太撤退并向北逃窜。寮国人民解放军当即跟踪追击，在第二天追上了敌军，迫使绝大部分敌军投降，并俘掳了敌军指挥官雷诺中尉。
    同时，从芒苛出发的第二路纵队向封萨里省省会推进。防守封萨里的敌军于二月二十三日下午闻风仓皇弃城向北逃窜。当天晚上十时，寮国人民解放军进入封萨里省省会，并追击逃敌。二月二十四日上午八时，寮国人民解放军在离封萨里十八公里的地方追上了敌军，歼灭几近全部的逃敌，其中击毙敌军指挥官理夏中尉并俘掳德洛斯特中尉和里奥中尉以及许多法军士官。目前，残敌正纷纷向寮国人民解放军投降。
    公报接着说，寮国人民解放军在前进的道路上，受到沿路和封萨里省省会居民的热烈欢迎。
    公报最后指出，这次胜利，是寮国人民解放军今年春季在寮国北部的南乌江流域、寮国中部的第九号公路和寮国南部的波罗芬高原接连取得胜利后的又一个重大的胜利。
