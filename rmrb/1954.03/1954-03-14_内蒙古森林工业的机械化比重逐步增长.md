    The proportion of mechanization in the forest industry of Inner Mongolia, a major timber supply base for our country, is gradually increasing.
    The Dahingganling forest region of Inner Mongolia is rich in Larch reserves. The wood is of good quality and is a main source of wood for construction of bridges and buildings. However, felling has always been carried out using handicraft methods. Most of the workers are farmers during the slack season, and production is limited to the spring and winter seasons. Therefore, the production time is short and the efficiency is very low. After liberation, in order to meet the country's large demand for timber, the Inner Mongolia forest industry sector gradually added mechanical equipment. In terms of improving timber transportation, forest railways were built successively, and tractors and mechanical log rafting machines were added. Last year, the Tuli River Forest Farm used fifty tractors to transport timber, and mechanically rafted timber accounted for more than 60% of the total timber rafted in the region. In addition, the Tuli River and Arxan Forest Industry Bureaus also utilized machinery to salvage timber and began to use mobile sawmills and log skidders. As the proportion of mechanization continues to increase, it has played a significant role in improving production efficiency. For example, the tractors driven by Zhou Baoyin and Wan Guoxing of the Tuli River Motor Transport Workshop traveled 107 kilometers a day and transported 386 cubic meters of timber, increasing the efficiency of timber transport by more than 25 times compared with animal power.

    内蒙古森林工业的机械化比重逐步增长
    我国木材的主要供应地之一——内蒙古大兴安岭林区，森林工业的机械化比重正在逐步增长。
    内蒙古大兴安岭林区所产的落叶松储积量既丰富，材质又好，是建筑桥梁和房屋的主要木材。但采伐一向是用手工业方法进行的。大部工人都是农闲时期的农民，生产局限于春、冬两季。因此，生产时间较短，效率很低。解放后，为了适应国家对木材的大量需要，内蒙古森林工业部门便逐步增添了机械设备。在改进木材运输方面曾先后修筑了森林铁路，增添了拖拉机和机械出河机。图里河林场去年使用五十部拖拉机搬运木材，机械出河的木材已达到全区出河数量的百分之六十以上。此外，图里河和阿尔山两个森林工业局还利用机械打捞木材和开始运用移动制材机和集材机等。由于机械化比重不断增长，对提高生产效率起了很大作用。如图里河机运车间周宝印和万国兴所驾驶的拖拉机，一天就跑了一百零七公里的路程，运输了三百八十六立方公尺的木材。比畜力运材效率提高了二十五倍以上。
