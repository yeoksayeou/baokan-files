    Further Expand Soviet Grain Production
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    "Further expand Soviet grain production!" The resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on March 2nd immediately received enthusiastic responses from workers across the Soviet Union. More young patriots are applying to develop land in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union; in Ukraine alone, more than 40,000 people have applied. From Moscow to Altai, from Ukraine to Kazakhstan, thousands of young people immediately plunged into land reclamation work. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union are competing to propose plans for reclaiming thousands of hectares of new land. Agricultural laborers across the Soviet Union have pledged to greatly develop grain production by expanding the area sown with grain and increasing grain yields. Factories across the Soviet Union that manufacture agricultural machinery and parts have launched a competition to complete the task of supplying agriculture in a timely manner.
    Grain production is the foundation of agricultural production. The Communist Party, government, and people of the Soviet Union have always paid attention to grain production and continuously improved it. As early as during the period of socialist construction, the Soviet Union implemented the socialist transformation of agriculture by guiding individual farmers to take the road of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, thereby greatly developing agricultural production, increasing grain and commodity grain output, and solving the grain problem. The war from 1941 to 1945 and the drought in 1946 brought difficulties to the Soviet Union in terms of grain shortages. Through the organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms and the improvement of farming techniques, Soviet grain production recovered to pre-war levels in the third year after the war, and exceeded this level in the following years, with a significant increase in commodity grain. The grain problem was solved once again. In 1952, the total grain harvest in the Soviet Union reached 8 billion poods (131.04 million metric tons), and the total harvest in 1953 was almost the same, which greatly exceeded the total harvest of 119 million metric tons in 1940. With the rapid development of the national economy, the need for grain is growing dramatically. There are five reasons to expand grain production. First, to better meet the growing need of the entire Soviet population for high-quality food. Second, to provide a sufficient supply of feed for the rapidly developing animal husbandry industry (in the Soviet Union, corn, barley, and oats are all used as feed). Third, as the areas for planting cotton, flax, vegetables, potatoes, and animal husbandry expand, the grain supply to the residents of these areas needs to be increased. Fourth, the country's grain reserves need to be renewed annually. Fifth, the country's need to export surplus grain is increasing. Therefore, after holding a series of meetings with advanced workers from machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms, and summarizing experience, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union timely made a resolution to further expand grain production, so that grain production can quickly adapt to objective needs.
    The resolution to further expand grain production was put forward half a year after the successful implementation of the resolution to further develop agriculture. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union discussed and made two historically significant documents for building communism in half a year, which once again shows that what the Communist Party cares about is the interests of the people. To greatly develop agriculture, to ensure the supply of abundant agricultural products to the people, and to ensure that agriculture is adapted to industry, is one of the central tasks of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at present.
    In the past six months, the Soviet Union has done a lot of work in developing public animal husbandry, expanding the planting of vegetables and potatoes, improving the work of machine tractor stations, and strengthening the leadership of the Party and the government over agriculture. The main focus was on strengthening agricultural cadres, especially strengthening the work of machine tractor stations. More than 100,000 agronomists and animal husbandry technicians throughout the Soviet Union went to machine tractor stations to serve collective farms. 23,000 engineers, technicians, and many mechanical technicians were transferred from industry and other sectors of the national economy to machine tractor stations. Machine tractor stations have added many agricultural machines. Now, machine tractor stations throughout the Soviet Union have more than one million tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit).
    The Soviet people are actively implementing the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Taking Ukraine as an example, 23,000 agronomists and animal husbandry technicians went from agricultural agencies to collective farms. 4,775 engineers and technicians were sent to machine tractor stations, and another 1,400 went to machine tractor stations in fraternal republics. 9,000 cadres with Party work experience and knowledge of collective farm production were transferred from urban Party organizations to rural areas to strengthen the work of Party district committees, machine tractor stations, and collective farms. Collective farms in the Ukrainian Republic harvested well last year, completed the task of selling grain and other agricultural products to the state in a timely manner, and carried out autumn plowing and wintering of livestock well. Collective farms and state farms will increase the planting of potatoes and vegetables by 49,000 hectares this year. The Trubezh River Bay depression will be reclaimed to increase the planting of vegetables and potatoes to meet the needs of Kiev residents. In order to increase the planting of vegetables, collective farms will expand greenhouses by 26,000 square meters more than last year, prepare 500,000 more hotbed frames, and have prepared 350 million peat humus blocks.
    The requirement to further expand grain production is put forward on the basis of the achievements of further developing agriculture in the past six months and the people's high labor enthusiasm. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union required that the state's requisition and purchase of grain be increased by 35 to 40 percent compared with 1953 in the next few years, and pointed out the method of achieving this arduous task by reclaiming virgin and fallow land, expanding grain planting, and increasing yields.
    In order to greatly increase grain production in a shorter period of time, the work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River basin, and certain parts of the North Caucasus has already begun. More than 13 million hectares of grain will be planted in these areas in two years. In 1955, 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion poods (approximately 189 million metric tons of grain) will be harvested from these reclaimed lands, of which 800 to 900 million poods (approximately 134 million metric tons) will be commodity grain. This means that the grain income from these reclaimed lands alone in 1955 will be equal to one-eighth to one-seventh of the total grain harvest in 1953, and the commodity grain income will be equal to more than one-third of the total commodity grain in the Soviet Union before the war.
    Taking Kazakhstan as an example, agricultural laborers in the republic will reclaim 6.3 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in two years to increase grain planting. In 1955, 550 million to 600 million poods of grain will be harvested from these reclaimed lands. The republic is capable of not only completing but also exceeding this task. There are more than 30 million hectares of arable land there, and more than 12 million hectares of uncultivated fertile land. These large areas of land are conducive to machine farming. After reclaiming 6.5 million hectares of land, Kazakhstan will catch up with Ukraine in terms of wheat planting area in 1955 and become one of the granaries of the Soviet Union. The great development of grain production is an important guarantee for the great development of animal husbandry in Kazakhstan. The entire Soviet Union is supporting Kazakhstan in reclaiming virgin and fallow land. Ukraine is assisting it with 15,000 tractor drivers, combine operators, and other technicians. A large number of agricultural machines have been transported there. This year, machine tractor stations and state farms in Kazakhstan will receive 53,800 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit). 92 grain state farms, each with a planting area of 20,000 to 30,000 hectares, are being established. Agricultural laborers are stepping up preparations to welcome spring plowing. This spring, 605,000 hectares of wheat and 50,000 hectares of other grains will be planted on the reclaimed land.
    In addition to reclaiming new land, agricultural laborers throughout the Soviet Union are exerting their potential to increase grain yields. This year, various parts of southern and southeastern Soviet Union will reduce the planting area of those perennial pastures with very low yields and use these lands to sow grain, especially feed grains. For example, Ukraine will plant 900,000 hectares more corn than last year. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms throughout the Soviet Union are preparing for timely spring sowing, more fully applying organic and mineral fertilizers, and more widely adopting advanced sowing methods, striving for a large increase in grain production this year.

    进一步扩展苏联谷物生产
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李　何
    进一步扩展苏联谷物生产！——苏联共产党中央全会三月二日的决议，立刻得到苏联全国劳动者热烈的响应。更多的青年爱国者申请到苏联东部地区开垦；仅仅在乌克兰，申请的人已达四万多。从莫斯科到阿尔泰，从乌克兰到哈萨克的几千青年，立即投入开垦工作。苏联东部地区各个集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场，竞相提出开垦成千上万公顷大块新地的计划。苏联全国各地农业劳动者纷纷保证：以扩大谷物的耕种面积，以提高谷物的收获量，大大发展谷物的生产。苏联各地制造农业机器和零件的工厂，展开了及时完成对农业的供应任务的竞赛。
    谷物生产，这是农业生产的根本。苏联共产党、政府和人民一向注意谷物生产和不断改进谷物生产。远在建设社会主义时期，苏联以引导个体农民走农业集体化和机械化的道路，对农业实行社会主义改造，从而大大发展了农业生产，提高了谷物和商品谷物的产量，解决了谷物问题。一九四一年到一九四五年的战争和一九四六年的旱灾，曾经带给苏联以谷物不足的困难。经过集体农庄在组织上和经济上的巩固，农作技术水平的提高，苏联谷物生产在战后第三年就恢复到了战前水平，随后几年就超过了这个水平，商品谷物也大大增加了。谷物问题又一次解决了。一九五二年苏联谷物的总收获量达到八十亿普特（十三亿一千零四十万公担），一九五三年的总收获量也差不多，这已超过了一九四○年十一亿九千万公担的总收获量很多。随着国民经济的迅速发展，对于谷物的需要急剧地增长着。有五个原因要求扩大谷物的生产。第一，要更好地满足全苏联居民对于上等食品日益增长的需要。第二，要供给在迅速发展的养畜业以充足的饲料（在苏联，玉米、大麦、燕麦都用作饲料）。第三，由于种棉花、亚麻、蔬菜、马铃薯以及养畜地区在扩大，对这些地区的居民要增加粮食供应。第四，国家的粮食储备要每年更新。第五，国家输出剩余的粮食的需要在增加。所以，苏联共产党中央委员会在召开机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄的先进工作者的一连串会议，总结经验以后，及时地作出了进一步扩大谷物生产的决议，以使谷物的产量与客观的需要迅速地适应起来。
    进一步扩大谷物生产的决议，是在进一步发展农业的决议顺利实行半年之后提出的。苏联共产党中央全会在半年中讨论了并且作出了两个对于建设共产主义有历史意义的文献，这又一次说明共产党所关心的就是人民的利益。大大发展农业，以保证供给人民以丰富的农产品，以保证农业与工业相适应，这是苏联共产党当前中心任务之一。
    在这半年中，苏联在发展公有养畜业、扩种蔬菜和马铃薯，改进机器拖拉机站工作，加强党和政府对于农业的领导，做了许多工作。主要的注意力集中于加强农业干部，特别是加强机器拖拉机站的工作。全苏联有十万名以上农艺师和养畜技师下到机器拖拉机站去为集体农庄服务。从工业和其他国民经济部门调了二万三千名工程师、技师和许多机械技术人员到机器拖拉机站去。机器拖拉机站增添了许多农业机器。现在苏联全国机器拖拉机站仅仅拖拉机（以每台十五匹马力计算）就有一百万台以上。
    苏联人民积极地执行着苏联共产党中央九月全会的决议。以乌克兰为例，二万三千名农艺师和养畜技师从农业机关下到了集体农庄去。四千七百七十五名工程师和技师被派到了机器拖拉机站，另有一千四百名到了兄弟共和国的机器拖拉机站。从城市党组织调了九千名有党工作经验并且知道集体农庄生产的干部到农村，以加强党区委会、机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的工作。乌克兰共和国各集体农庄去年很好地收割，及时地完成了向国家交售粮食和其他农产品的义务，很好地进行了秋耕和牲畜过冬的工作。各集体农庄和国营农场今年将增种四万九千公顷马铃薯和蔬菜。将开垦特鲁别热河湾洼地来增种蔬菜和马铃薯，以满足基辅居民的需要。为了增种蔬菜，各集体农庄比去年将扩增二万六千平方公尺温室，多准备了五十万个温床架，并且已准备了三亿五千万个泥炭腐植土泥块。
    进一步扩大谷物生产的要求，就是在半年来进一步发展农业的成就和人民的高涨的劳动热情的基础上提出来的。苏联共产党中央全会要求在最近几年内使国家征购和收购的粮食，比一九五三年增加百分之三十五到四十，并且指出了以开垦生荒地和熟荒地、扩种谷物和提高收获量的办法来实现这个艰巨任务。
    为了在较短期间大大增产谷物，在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索某些地方开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作已经开始。两年内在这些地区将种植一千三百万公顷以上的谷物。在一九五五年从这些被开垦的土地上将收获十一亿到十二亿普特（约一亿八、九千万公担谷物），其中八、九亿普特（约一亿三、四千万公担）是商品谷物。这就是说，在一九五五年仅从这些被开垦的土地上收入的谷物，就等于一九五三年谷物总收获量的八分之一到七分之一，收入的商品谷物等于战前全苏联商品谷物的三分之一以上。
    以哈萨克为例，共和国农业劳动者在两年内将开垦六百三十万公顷生荒地和熟荒地以增种谷物。在一九五五年将从这些被开垦的土地上收获五亿五千万到六亿普特的谷物。共和国是有可能不仅完成而且超过这个任务的。那里有三千多万公顷可耕的土地，而未开垦的肥沃土地在一千二百余万公顷以上。这些大块土地是利于机器耕作的。开垦了六百五十万公顷土地以后，哈萨克在小麦种地面积方面在一九五五年将赶上乌克兰，而成为苏联的谷仓之一。谷物生产的大发展，是哈萨克养畜业大发展的重要保证。全苏联都在支援哈萨克开垦生荒地和熟荒地。乌克兰援助它一万五千名拖拉机手、联合机手和其他技术人员。大批农业机器已经运到它那里。今年哈萨克的机器拖拉机站和国营农场将得到五万三千八百台拖拉机（以每台十五匹马力计算）。九十二个种地面积各两三万公顷的谷物国营农场在建立着。农业劳动者在加紧进行迎接春耕的准备工作。今年春天在被开垦的土地上将种下六十万五千公顷小麦和五万公顷其他谷物。
    除了开垦新地以外，苏联全国农业劳动者都在为提高谷物的收获量而发挥潜在能力。苏联南部和东南部各地今年将缩小那些收获量很低的多年生牧草的种地面积，把这些地用来播种谷物，特别是饲料谷物。例如乌克兰今年将比去年多种九十万公顷玉米。全苏各地集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场都准备以及时的春播，更充分地施用有机和矿质肥料，更广泛地采用先进的播种方法，争取今年的谷物大增产。
