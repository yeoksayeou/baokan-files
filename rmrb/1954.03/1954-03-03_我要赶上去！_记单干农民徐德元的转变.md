I Want to Catch Up!
    —A Record of the Transformation of Individual Farmer Xu Deyuan
  　Gao Changren
    Xu Deyuan is a young farmer from Houwang Village, Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang County, Hubei Province. His ancestral home is in Huanggang County. Without land of his own, he herded cattle for others from a young age, and began working as a laborer at twelve. He has lived in Houwang Village for twelve years. Years of labor have made him a strong and capable farmer. When he works, one person can do the work of one and a half. The villagers say he is "full of energy." He is honest and straightforward. Whether he is working for himself or helping others, he always does his best and never slacks off or tries to be clever. When he sees something unfair, he can't help but speak his mind. During the land reform, he was an active participant in the struggle against landlords. Because of these excellent qualities, after the land reform in 1951, he was elected as a member of the Gongjiaqiao Township Farmers' Association.

    In the spring of 1952, Xu Deyuan responded to the government's call and briefly participated in the temporary mutual aid team of Zeng Heqing in Houwang Village. At that time, this mutual aid team had many problems: Zeng Heqing himself was a seriously selfish person. He asked everyone to help him farm the land while he went to sell cloth and engage in "sideline occupations," saying that he would share the profits when he made money. As a result, Zeng Heqing made money but deliberately said he had lost it, and the team members helped him farm for a season for nothing. The evaluation of work and recording of points were also unreasonable. Regardless of the strength of the labor force, one day was counted as one work point, which was most disadvantageous for strong laborers like Xu Deyuan. As a result, this mutual aid team collapsed. The young Xu Deyuan did not learn from the failure of the mutual aid team. On the contrary, he believed: "Mutual aid teams have too many people and too many opinions. Everyone has their own agenda and will never succeed." He believed that with his own strong labor force, he would definitely farm the land better than a mutual aid team. From the autumn of 1952, he went solo. Later, the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team mobilized him to join several times, but he refused.

      Competing with the Mutual Aid Team
    During the spring plowing and production in 1953, township cadres and mutual aid team leaders attended a meeting at the township government to set production plans. The Lin Baoqing mutual aid team set high production targets: 1,000 catties of rice per mu for high-yield fields, 800 catties per mu for fertile fields, and 650 catties per mu for ordinary fields. Moreover, they introduced methods for achieving high yields: deep plowing, close planting, using the "Victory Xian" improved variety, applying more base fertilizer, and timely topdressing. Based on his own experience, Xu Deyuan determined that the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team's high-yield plan was impossible to achieve. He thought, "Even comparing it to the best fields in the past, with enough fertilizer, the most you could get was 600 catties per mu. They set 650 catties for ordinary fields, which they can't possibly achieve. Saying they can get 800 catties or 1,000 catties is even more nonsense. Moreover, if the rice grows too well, it will lodge." The more he thought about it, the more he disliked the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team for making empty promises and bragging. When returning from the meeting, he said to his cousin Yu Mingshan (the deputy leader of the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team): "If your mutual aid team can complete the plan, I will give you all the grain I harvest." At this time, the solo farmer Xu Deyuan secretly wanted to compete with the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team.

    This competition began when transplanting rice seedlings. At that time, the mutual aid team was busy digging field banks (i.e., removing weeds and small tree roots from the edges of the fields), and Xu Deyuan followed suit; the mutual aid team cut sod to accumulate fertilizer, and Xu Deyuan followed suit; the mutual aid team carried pond mud, and Xu Deyuan followed suit. The mutual aid team went to the fields at the crack of dawn every day, and Xu Deyuan went to the fields before dawn. On the surface, Xu Deyuan seemed to be working faster than the mutual aid team. However, the quality was much worse. The mutual aid team could only dig one field bank per person per day, but they cleared all the weeds and small tree roots at once. Xu Deyuan could dig three to four field banks a day, but he could only remove the grass roots, not the tree roots, because he couldn't manage it alone. The same was true for cutting sod to accumulate fertilizer: he was fast in the first few days, but when the results were compared, the mutual aid team could apply more than 140 loads of fertilizer per mu, while he only applied a little more than 42 loads per mu.

    When it came to transplanting rice seedlings, Xu Deyuan hired eight short-term laborers for a day, starting the transplanting a few days earlier than the mutual aid team. He could transplant 1.4 mu of rice seedlings per day by himself, but he planted them very sparsely. The mutual aid team only transplanted 1.05 mu per person per day, practicing close planting at five by eight inches. Xu Deyuan secretly laughed at the mutual aid team: "How can the rice grow if you plant it so densely?" When he finished transplanting a few days earlier than the mutual aid team, he even said a few sarcastic remarks to the mutual aid team: "You guys are transplanting fast, I'm falling behind." At that time, the summer famine had not completely passed, and he had some financial difficulties, so he picked up his small hammer and went to Guanshan Mountain to break stones for a sideline occupation.

    When it came to weeding, Xu Deyuan's difficulties arose. At this time, he had to go to the mountains to break stones and also weed the fields. But with so much land and only his sixteen-year-old younger brother and himself to work, he was always stretched thin. While he was breaking stones in the mountains, the weeds in the fields quickly grew into a thick blanket. By the time he came to weed the fields, he could only weed a little more than 0.2 mu a day. Because the mutual aid team had already weeded the fields once or twice, there were not many weeds left, and they could weed more than 0.84 mu a day. Later, seeing that the weeds were growing rapidly and he couldn't keep up, he simply stopped weeding and went to break stones instead. In this stage of the competition, he admitted that his crops were not as good as the mutual aid team's.

    Individual Farming is Ultimately No Match for Mutual Aid Teams
    When the crops were about to ripen and the township launched a field visit and comparison campaign, the farmer representatives believed that the rice of the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team was growing well and could achieve the high-yield plan. Yu Mingshan's more than 8.42 mu of land could also yield more than 50 shi of grain. Although Xu Deyuan's own crops were not as good as the mutual aid team's, he still didn't believe that the mutual aid team could achieve that "bragging" high-yield plan. He was convinced that the rice fields of the mutual aid team, which generally practiced close planting, would inevitably lodge and reduce production when the time came. He was particularly unconvinced that his cousin Yu Mingshan's more than 8.42 mu of land could yield more than 50 shi of grain. He said to Yu Mingshan again: "Your field used to yield only 30 shi of grain. Even if it grows well this year, it can only yield 40 shi. I'll make a bet with you. If you can yield 50 shi, I'll give you all the grain I harvest."

    The facts of the autumn harvest shattered Xu Deyuan's conservative thinking. The mutual aid team did achieve high yields, and Yu Mingshan did indeed harvest more than 50 shi of grain (he had one mu of high-yield land, which also yielded 1,380 catties). The mutual aid team's high-yield plans were all realized, and the closely planted rice did not lodge. Faced with the facts, Xu Deyuan began to waver. He looked at his own yields: the average yield per mu was only a little more than 300 catties of rice. There was a piece of more than 1.7 mu of land adjacent to Yu Mingshan's, with the same area and soil quality. Yu Mingshan harvested 12 shi of grain, while he only harvested 8 shi. Through this lesson, he believed that mutual aid teams could overcome difficulties and produce more grain. He also remembered that he had engaged in sideline occupations while farming solo, which had interfered with agricultural production. In the mutual aid team, some people also had financial difficulties in the summer, but they solved their problems through mutual assistance and loans, or by individuals engaging in sideline occupations, with the mutual aid team helping them with agricultural production. Thinking of this, he believed that mutual aid teams were indeed stronger than individual farming. The Lin Baoqing mutual aid team was not bragging in the spring, but had truly achieved a bumper harvest.

    He Participated in the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative
    This year, the farmers of Gongjiaqiao Township studied the General Line, and he understood the bright future for farmers—the path of collectivization—more deeply than others. Because he already had the personal experience that mutual aid teams were stronger than individual farming. He wanted to join the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team, but he estimated that the members of the mutual aid team would ridicule him when they met. However, things turned out differently than he expected. After studying the General Line, the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team was going to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. One evening, Lin Baoqing enthusiastically came to him and talked about the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, soliciting his opinions and asking if he was willing to join. Xu Deyuan was very grateful for the brotherly care of the mutual aid team. He said to Lin Baoqing: "I took the wrong path in the past. This time, I am determined to do a good job in agricultural production. Since you all think highly of me, I am determined to join your agricultural production cooperative. I didn't join the mutual aid team in the past, but now I want to catch up. I have abandoned the idea of getting rich alone."

    After this conversation, Xu Deyuan studied the articles of association of the agricultural production cooperative with the members of the Lin Baoqing mutual aid team, preparing for the establishment of the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative. At many meetings, he reported his failure in the competition with the mutual aid team to everyone, advising individual farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and encouraging qualified mutual aid teams to break down their concerns and transform into agricultural production cooperatives.

    Xu Deyuan's transformation was welcomed by the masses in Houwang Village. When the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative was established on January 9th, he was elected as a member of the cooperative's management committee.

    我要赶上去！
    ——记单干农民徐德元的转变
  　高长任
    徐德元是湖北省武昌县龚家桥乡后汪村的一个青年农民。他的老家在黄冈县，无田无地，从小帮人家放牛，十二岁便卖工。他搬到后汪村已有十二年了。多年的劳动把他锻炼成一个健壮的种田能手。他做起活来一个人可以顶一个半人。村里人都说他“浑身是劲”。他为人老实、直爽，不管是自己做活或帮人做活，总是尽力干，从不偷懒图巧。看到不公平的事，他就忍不住要说直话。土地改革中他是斗争地主的积极分子。因为他有这些优秀的品质，一九五一年土地改革结束后，就被选为龚家桥乡农民协会的委员。
    一九五二年春天，徐德元响应人民政府的号召，曾一度参加过后汪村曾和卿的临时互助组。那时这个互助组存在很多问题：曾和卿自己就是一个严重的自私自利的人。他要求大家帮他种田，他去贩卖布匹，搞“副业”，讲好了赚钱回来大家分。结果，曾和卿赚了钱故意说赔了本，而组员们就白白帮他种了一季田。评工记分也不合理，不管劳动力强弱，一天算一个工，像徐德元这样劳动力强的人最吃亏。结果，这个互助组就垮台了。年青的徐德元没有总结互助组失败的教训，反而认为：“互助组人多嘴多，一人一条心，人人都为自己打算，永远也搞不好。”凭自己强壮的劳动力，田地一定会种得比互助组好。一九五二年秋天起，他就单干了。以后林宝卿互助组曾几次动员他参加，他都拒绝了。
      向互助组竞赛
    一九五三年春耕生产的时候，乡干部、互助组长在乡政府开会，订生产计划。林宝卿互助组订了高额丰产田每亩产水稻一千斤，丰产田产八百斤，一般田产六百五十斤的生产计划，而且，介绍了争取丰产的办法：深耕、密植，用“胜利籼”良种，多施底肥，及时追肥。徐德元凭自己的经验，断定林宝卿互助组的丰产计划是不能实现的。他想：“拿过去的好田来比，肥料上的再足，最多的每亩田只打六百斤。他们一般田就订了六百五十斤，怎么也打不了，说打八百斤、一千斤更是吹牛。而且，谷子长的太好，就会倒伏。”他越想越讨厌林宝卿互助组说空话、吹牛。散会回来时，他对他的表哥余明山（林宝卿互助组的副组长）说：“你们互助组要是能完成计划，我打的粮食都送给你们。”这时单干的徐德元就暗地里想向林宝卿互助组竞赛。
    这个竞赛是从下秧苗的时候开始的。当时，互助组忙着挖田岸（即锄去田边的杂草和小树根），徐德元也跟着挖；互助组砍草皮积肥，徐德元也跟着砍；互助组挑塘泥，徐德元也跟着挑。互助组每天天一亮就下田，徐德元天不亮就下田。表面上看来，徐德元干的活，确比互助组快一些。但质量上就差的多了。互助组一个人平均每天只能挖出一条田岸，但是把杂草、小树根一下子都挖个净光。徐德元一天能挖三条到四条田岸，但只能锄了草根，没有锄去树根，因为他一个人忙不过来。挖草皮积肥也是这样：开始几天他搞的快，但结果一比较，互助组每亩田能上一百四十多担肥料，他一亩田只上四十二担多一点。
    插秧了，徐德元请了八个短工插了一天，又比互助组早开几天秧门。他一个人一天能插一亩四分田的秧，但插的很稀。互助组一人一天只插一亩零五厘田，实行了五八寸密插。徐德元暗地里笑着互助组：“看你们插的那么密，谷子怎么长的起来。”当他比互助组早几天插完秧的时候，他还对互助组说了两句风凉话：“你们插的快，我是掉队了。”那时夏荒还没有完全度过，他生活上还有些困难，就拿起小铁锤，上官山打石子搞副业去了。
    薅草的时候，徐德元的困难来了。这时他又要上山打石子，又要薅草，而田又多，只有一个十六岁的弟弟和他两个人劳动，总是顾了这头，丢了那头。当他在山上打石子的时候，田里的草很快长成厚厚的一片，这时他才来薅田，一天只能薅二分多田，而互助组田里的草因为已薅过一两遍，草不多了，一天能薅八分四厘多田。后来，他看草长的猛，薅不过来，索性不薅草，专去打石子了。在这一段比赛中，他承认自己的庄稼是没有互助组好。
    单干到底比不上互助组
    庄稼将要成熟，全乡展开田间参观评比运动的时候，农民代表们都认为林宝卿互助组谷子长的好，可以达到丰产的计划。余明山的八亩四分二厘多田，也可以打到五十多石谷。徐德元自己庄稼虽不如互助组，但他总不相信互助组会达到那个“吹牛”的丰产计划。他认定了互助组普遍实行密植的稻田，到时候一定要倒伏减产。他特别对他表哥余明山的八亩四分二厘多田能打五十多石谷不服气，他又对余明山说：“你这田过去只能打三十石谷，今年就算长的再好，也只能打四十石，我和你打个赌你要是能打五十石，我收的谷子全送给你。”
    秋收的事实打破了徐德元的保守思想，互助组的确是丰产了，余明山果真打了五十多石谷（他有一亩高额丰产田，还打了一千三百八十斤）。互助组的丰产计划都实现了，密植的水稻也没有倒伏。在事实面前，徐德元开始震动了。他看一看自己的产量：每亩田平均只产水稻三百多斤，有一块一亩七分多田和余明山毗连，同样面积和土质，余明山收了十二石谷，自己只收八石。通过这个教训，他相信互助组就是能克服困难，多打粮食。他又想起自己单干搞了副业，就误了农业的事情来，互助组里夏天也有人生活困难，但他们通过了互助互借或者个别人搞副业，互助组帮他搞农业，都解决了困难。想到这里，他就相信互助组的确比单干强。林宝卿互助组春天并没有吹牛，而是真正获得了丰收。
    他参加了胜利农业生产合作社
    今年龚家桥乡农民学习了总路线，他对农民的光明前途——走合作化的道路的道理，比别人领会的更深刻。因为已经有了互助组比单干强的亲身体验。他有心参加林宝卿互助组，但估计互助组的人见了面，一定会讽刺他，可是事情出乎他的意料之外。林宝卿互助组学习总路线之后，要转成农业生产合作社了，有一天晚上，林宝卿还满怀热心地来找他，和他谈起要成立农业生产合作社的事，征求他的意见，问他愿不愿意参加。徐德元受到互助组兄弟般的关怀，非常感激，他对林宝卿说：“我过去走错了路，这回坚决把农业生产搞好，你们大家瞧得起我，我是坚决参加你们的农业生产合作社的。我过去没参加互助组，现在我要赶上去，单独发财的思想，我是丢掉了。”
    这次谈话以后，徐德元就和林宝卿互助组的组员们一起学习农业生产合作社的章程，准备成立胜利农业生产合作社。在许多会议上，他都把自己和互助组竞赛失败的经过向大家报告，劝单干农民参加互助合作，并鼓励有条件的互助组打破顾虑转为农业生产合作社。
    徐德元的转变，受到后汪村群众的欢迎，当一月九日胜利农业生产合作社成立的时候，他被选为社务管理委员会的委员。
