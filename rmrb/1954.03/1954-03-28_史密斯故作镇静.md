    Smith Pretends to Be Calm
　  Dá Rén
    According to a Vietnam News Agency report on March 8th: On March 4th and 6th, the Vietnamese People's Army attacked the heavily guarded Gia Lam Airport near Hanoi and the Cat Bi Airport near Haiphong, destroying seventy-eight aircraft. According to the Associated Press, "Many of the destroyed aircraft were recently shipped from the United States in order to transport more supplies and reinforcements to Dien Bien Phu." Furthermore, two hundred American airmen participating in the Indochina War were stationed at Cat Bi Airport. The sudden attack by the Vietnamese People's Army not only inflicted the French Air Force's greatest defeat since the beginning of the Indochina War, but also dealt a major blow to the American airmen "involved in the Indochina War." After the airport attacks, the French military authorities had to "take strict security measures" immediately in Hanoi, declare "Haiphong in a state of emergency," "reinforce the guard posts" at Cat Bi Airport, and "urgently order all bases to immediately step up security measures."
    However, Senator Alexander Smith, chairman of the Far East Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told an American reporter that he was "not overly surprised" by the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on the airport near Haiphong where American airmen were stationed, and believed that "such things could happen anywhere in the world."
    Are the American rulers really so "calm" and "composed"? Let's listen to the reactions of Senator Smith's colleagues! According to a Washington Associated Press dispatch on March 7th, Democratic Senator Walter George said with alarm: "They (referring to the American airmen in Indochina) may be in great danger." According to another Washington Associated Press dispatch on March 9th, another Senator, John Stennis, was also "alarmed by the Viet Minh's attack on the airport where American technicians were repairing French aircraft." And the Associated Press itself had to admit that the Vietnamese People's Army "achieved a chilling victory" in the attack.
    Clearly, the explosions at Gia Lam Airport and Cat Bi Airport shook not only Hanoi, but also Washington! Smith's pretense of calmness is nothing more than putting on a brave face.

    史密斯故作镇静
　  达仁
    据越南通讯社三月八日消息：越南人民军在三月四日和六日，先后袭击了敌军警卫森严的河内附近的嘉林机场和海防附近的吉碑机场，炸毁了七十八架飞机。据合众社说：“被炸毁的飞机中许多都是最近从美国运到这里来的，为的是可以多运一些供应品和增援部队到奠边府去”。而且参加侵略印度支那战争的二百名美国空军人员就驻在吉碑机场。越南人民军的突然袭击，不仅使法国空军遭到自印度支那战争开始以来最大的一次失败，而且给“参与印度支那战争”的美国空军人员以重大的打击。袭击机场事件发生后，法军当局不得不在河内立刻“采取严格的保安措施”，宣布“海防已处于紧急状态”，在吉碑机场上“加强了岗哨”，并且“火速命令各基地立即加紧实行安全措施。”
    可是，美国参议院外交委员会远东事务小组委员会主席、参议员亚历山大·史密斯却对一位美国记者说：他对越南人民军袭击海防附近驻有美国空军人员的机场“并不感到过分吃惊”，而且认为“这样的事情能够在世界任何地方发生”。
    难道美国统治者真是如此“坦然”和“镇静”吗？我们再听一听美国参议员史密斯的同僚们的反应吧！据合众社华盛顿三月七日电讯报道，民主党参议员华尔特·乔治惊悸地说：“他们（指在印度支那的美国空军人员）可能陷于很大的危险之中。”另据合众社华盛顿三月九日电讯报道，另一位参议员约翰·史坦尼斯，也对“越盟向美国技术人员检修法国飞机的机场进行攻击一节，感到惊慌。”而合众社自己呢，也不得不承认：越南人民军在袭击中“获得了令人寒心的胜利”。
    显然，嘉林机场和吉碑机场上的爆炸声，不仅震撼了河内，而且震撼了华盛顿！史密斯的故作镇静，不过是打肿脸充胖子而已。
