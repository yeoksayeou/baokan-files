North China regions, in accordance with the needs of national economic construction and the people's livelihood, have formulated specific plans for increasing agricultural production this year.

Hebei Province aims to achieve an average yield of 146 jin per mu for grain crops this year, an increase of 24.3 percent compared to last year, with a total output increase of 28.1 percent compared to last year. It also aims to plant 16 million mu of cotton, an expansion of approximately 14 percent compared to last year, with an average yield of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 21.6 percent compared to last year, and a total output increase of 39.1 percent compared to last year. Furthermore, it aims to plant 6.4 million mu of oil crops, an expansion of 19.3 percent compared to last year. Shanxi Province aims to increase grain production by 7 percent based on 1953; expand cotton planting area by 630,000 mu, increase the unit area yield by 8 percent, and increase the total output by 26.7 percent; at the same time, it requires appropriate expansion of the planting area of oil crops, vegetables, and other crops according to needs. Beijing and Tianjin municipalities have also put forward specific requirements for agricultural production in suburban areas. Beijing suburbs are required to increase vegetable production by 120 jin per mu this year, increase grain production by 13 jin, and appropriately expand the planting area.

In order to complete this year's agricultural production tasks, in addition to actively and steadily developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, leading farmers to accumulate fertilizer, preserve soil moisture, and strengthen wheat field management, Cangxian, Tongxian, Baoding, Zhangjiakou and other special districts in Hebei Province have also transported more than 3 million jin of spring wheat seeds, more than 30 million jin of fine fertilizer, more than 40,000 jin of pesticides, and more than 10,000 sprayers to the countryside ahead of schedule. In order to meet the needs of expanding cotton fields, the cooperative federations of various counties have also prepared more than 2.9 million jin of S-brand cotton seeds. Due to thorough preparation, early-maturing crops in various regions can be sown on time, and Tianjin, Cangxian and other special districts have completed the sowing of more than 500,000 mu of spring wheat. In order to ensure the timely sowing of 50 million mu of autumn fields and 4 million mu of cotton fields, and the completion of the cultivation work of nearly 20 million mu of wheat fields, Shanxi Province has sent work groups led by Li Bingquan, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, to Yuci, Yanbei, Xinxian, Linfen, and Yuncheng special districts to inspect and promote drought prevention and resistance, process seeds, and promote close planting methods. The work groups will implement the policy of providing assistance by district and category during the inspection. In Yuci, Linfen, Yuncheng and other special districts, the main task is to help the local areas complete the task of expanding cotton fields and strengthen technical guidance for cotton fields; in Yanbei special district, the main task is to help the local areas ensure the completion of the expanded planting area of oil crops; in Xinxian special district, the main task is to help investigate and explore the production potential of mountainous areas, assist local leading departments in formulating comprehensive development plans for agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in mountainous areas, and create experience in leading production in mountainous areas.

    华北各地订出今年粮棉增产计划
    华北各地按照国家经济建设和人民生活的需要，已订出今年农业增产的具体计划。
    河北省今年要求粮食作物每亩平均产量达到一百四十六斤，比去年提高百分之二十四点三，总产量比去年提高百分之二十八点一；要求棉花播种一千六百万亩，比去年约扩大面积百分之十四，每亩平均产四十斤皮棉，比去年提高百分之二十一点六，总产量比去年提高百分之三十九点一；要求油料作物种植六百四十万亩，比去年扩大百分之十九点三。山西省要求在一九五三年的基础上，增产粮食百分之七；扩大棉花种植面积六十三万亩，单位面积产量提高百分之八，总产量增加百分之二十六点七；同时要求根据需要适当扩大油料、蔬菜等作物种植面积。北京、天津两市对郊区农业生产也都提出具体要求。北京郊区今年要求每亩蔬菜地增产一百二十斤，粮食增产十三斤，并适当扩大播种面积。
    为了完成今年农业生产任务，各地除积极稳步地发展互助合作运动，领导农民积肥、保墒、加强麦田管理外，河北省沧县、通县、保定、张家口等专区并提前把三百多万斤春麦种、三千多万斤细肥、四万多斤农药、一万多架喷雾器运到农村。为了适应扩大棉田的需要，各县合作社联合社还准备了二百九十多万斤斯字棉种籽。由于准备充分，各地早熟作物都能按时播种，天津、沧县等专区已完成春麦播种五十多万亩。山西省为了保证五千万亩秋田、四百万亩棉田适时播种及将近两千万亩麦田加工工作的完成，已由省农业厅副厅长李秉权等率领工作团分赴榆次、雁北、忻县、临汾、运城各专区检查和推动防旱抗旱、处理种籽和推广密植法。工作团在检查中将贯彻分区、分类帮助的方针。在榆次、临汾、运城等专区，主要为帮助当地完成扩大棉田任务和加强棉田技术指导；在雁北专区，主要为帮助当地保证完成扩大油料作物的种植面积；在忻县专区，主要是帮助调查发掘山区生产潜在力，协助当地领导部门制订山区农林牧全面发展计划，创造领导山区生产的经验。
