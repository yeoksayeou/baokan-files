Title: The Person on the Cart

    The rubber-wheeled cart rattles and rolls forward,
    The person on the cart is strong and young,
    With trousers adorned with red flowers, a sky-blue top,
    Rose-colored cheeks, and a snow-white headscarf.
    The lively Spring Festival has just passed,
    The vernal equinox is almost upon us,
    The young people have long been impatient,
    The awakened land is already urging them on.
    The rubber-wheeled cart rattles and rolls forward,
    The person on the cart also sways, half-asleep, half-awake,
    Not longing for the joy of the festival at her mother's home,
    She is imagining the scene of rushing back:
    The commune's plows must have been repaired,
    How much manure to apply to which plot has been decided,
    The golden wheat seeds have been turned out and checked,
    Just waiting for her to rush back and start spring plowing.
    In the distance, she sees a figure at the cooperative's entrance,
    Perhaps he has been waiting there to greet her?
    The person on the cart has lost patience,
    Urging the horse: Go faster!

    车上的人儿
    孙滨
    胶皮轱辘车摇呀摇的前进，
    车上的人儿壮实又年轻，
    红花朵朵的裤子，天蓝的上身，
    玫瑰色的脸儿，雪白的头巾。
    才过了热闹的春节，
    论时节也快近春分，
    年轻的人们早就等不及了，
    醒来的土地已经在催促着他们。
    胶皮轱辘车摇呀摇的前进，
    车上的人儿也摇呀摇的半睡半醒，
    倒不是留恋娘家过节的快乐，
    她在想像着赶回家去的情景：
    社里的犁头想来都已经修好，
    哪块地该上多少粪也早分匀，
    金黄的麦种已经翻出来检查过，
    就等着她赶回去动手春耕。
    远远地望见合作社门口有个人影，
    也许是他早就等在那儿相迎？
    车上的人儿已经失去了耐心，
    催促着马儿：你快快前进！
