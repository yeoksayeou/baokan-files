Xinhua News Agency, March 24th:

    The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is preparing, according to the predetermined plan of the US side, to forcibly enlist all 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war abducted from Korea to Taiwan into the Chiang bandit army. According to a message from the Chiang bandit gang's news agency, in order to further force the Volunteer Army prisoners of war to join the Chiang bandit army, the Chiang bandit gang directed its secret agents on the 23rd to force all Volunteer Army prisoners of war to sign the list of those joining the Chiang bandit army. Prior to this, more than 60 Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were abducted from Korea to Taiwan by the US-Syngman Rhee bandit gang in October last year were all forced to join the Chiang bandit army on March 10th.
    The trick played by the Chiang bandit gang is the final step in realizing the US conspiracy to force prisoners of war to serve as cannon fodder. According to a report by the Pan-Asia News Agency, which has close ties with the Chiang bandit gang, on January 29th of this year, relevant parties of the Chiang bandit gang stated as early as when the Volunteer Army prisoners of war were abducted to Taiwan that these Volunteer Army prisoners of war would be "organized into a division with the support and equipment of the United States." In order to realize this criminal conspiracy, the Chiang bandit gang imprisoned the Volunteer Army prisoners of war in three concentration camps in northern Taiwan, and preserved the special agent ringleaders and their entire set of terrorist organizations who had persecuted prisoners of war in the US prisoner of war camps, forcing the prisoners of war to undergo "ideological education" and military training. According to a report by "New York Times" reporter Reubman on January 28th, these prisoners of war "are as well organized as they were in the Korean prisoner of war camps - organized into squadrons... Each unit has a leader (referring to special agent ringleaders)." When Chiang Ching-kuo, the head of the Chiang bandit secret agents, went to the concentration camp in Dahu on January 28th to inspect the work of these secret agents, he openly stated that he would force the prisoners of war to undergo "political training and security police work (referring to special agent training)," and would take "appropriate measures" against prisoners of war who resolutely opposed joining the Chiang bandit army.
    This criminal conspiracy carried out by the US in directing the Chiang bandit gang once again proves to the world that the US's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is completely a deception built on the blood and tears of prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly stated that the US is at all times fully responsible for tracking down and handing over all prisoners of war it has forcibly detained. The US must not escape the responsibility it should bear for this crime.

### 蒋匪准备把劫走的志愿军战俘强迫编入匪军  再一次证明美方所谓“自愿遣返”是血腥骗局

    蒋匪准备把劫走的志愿军战俘强迫编入匪军
    再一次证明美方所谓“自愿遣返”是血腥骗局
    【新华社二十四日讯】蒋介石残余匪帮正在按照美方的预定计划，准备把被美方从朝鲜劫往台湾的一万四千名中国人民志愿军被俘人员全部强迫编入蒋匪军。据蒋匪帮通讯社的消息透露，为了进一步强迫把志愿军被俘人员编入蒋匪军，蒋匪帮已在二十三日指挥特务分子强迫全部志愿军被俘人员在参加蒋匪军的名册上签了名。在这以前，在去年十月间被美李匪帮从朝鲜劫往台湾的六十多名志愿军被俘人员，已在三月十日全部被强迫参加了蒋匪军。
    蒋匪帮玩弄的这个花样是它实现美国强迫战俘充当炮灰的阴谋的最后步骤。据与蒋匪帮有密切关系的泛亚通讯社今年一月二十九日的报道，蒋匪帮有关方面早在志愿军被俘人员被劫往台湾之时就已表示，这些志愿军被俘人员将“在美国的支持和配备下，编成一个师。”为了实现这个罪恶阴谋，蒋匪帮把志愿军被俘人员囚禁在台湾北部的三个集中营里，并且保存了原在美方战俘营里迫害战俘的特务头子及其一整套恐怖组织，强迫对战俘进行“思想教育”和军事训练。据“纽约时报”记者赖勃曼一月二十八日报道，这些战俘“像在朝鲜战俘营内一样，被很好地组织起来了——以中队组织起来……每一个单位有一个首领（按即特务头子）。”蒋匪特务头子蒋经国在一月二十八日到大湖的集中营里去检查这些特务分子的工作时公开表示，他要强迫战俘进行“政治训练和保安警察工作（按即特务训练）”，并且对坚决反对参加蒋匪军的战俘采取“适当的办法”。
    美国指挥蒋匪帮进行的这个罪恶阴谋再一次向全世界证明：美方的所谓“自愿遣返”完全是一个建筑在战俘的鲜血和眼泪上的骗局。朝中方面已经一再声明，美方对于它所强迫扣留的战俘，在任何时候都负有全部追回、并提出交代的责任。美方决不能逃脱对这一罪行所应承担的责任。
