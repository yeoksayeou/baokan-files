Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: The national grain planned purchase policy implemented by the state starting last November has achieved a great victory due to the enormous efforts of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels and local people's governments, and the soaring patriotic enthusiasm of farmers across the country. According to statistics up to the end of January this year, the total amount of grain purchased by the state from July 1953 through market purchases and planned purchases already accounts for more than 85 percent of the state's grain purchase plan. Of this, the amount purchased in the last three months exceeded the amount purchased in the three months from November 1952 to January 1953 by 126 percent. Judging from the current situation of farmers selling grain in various regions, it is possible that the state's grain purchase plan will be overfulfilled. By the end of January, the amount of grain purchased by the state had increased by more than 70 percent compared to the same period last year, exceeding the level of any year since liberation.

    With the start of China's planned construction period, various construction projects are flourishing, requiring the state to have sufficient grain to ensure supply to cities, industrial and mining areas, market towns, and grain-deficient households in the vast rural areas, to guarantee stable grain prices, and to support industrial construction. In 1953, China's grain output exceeded the highest pre-war annual output level by 10 percent, an increase of more than 45 percent compared to the early days of liberation in 1949. However, due to the Chinese farmers' habit of "using a little money, selling a little grain," and the influence of the free market and private merchant speculation, they had a "wait-and-see attitude, reluctant to sell," which considerably affected the completion of the state's grain purchase plan. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out the work of planned grain purchase nationwide, mobilizing farmers with surplus grain to sell most of their surplus grain to the state. This planned purchase of grain only accounts for a part of the surplus grain in the hands of farmers, and the price is fair, with the planned purchase price being about 8 percent higher than the average purchase price in 1952. As a result, grain-selling farmers across the country increased their income by approximately three trillion yuan.

    When carrying out the grain planned purchase movement in various regions, the first step was to convene cadre meetings from top to bottom. After the cadres understood the policy and gained experience through key experiments, the planned purchase movement was then fully launched. The momentum and scale of this movement can be compared to our great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Millions of cadres across the country participated in the grain planned purchase. After arriving in the countryside, they first vigorously promoted the Party's general line for the transition period to the farmers, patiently explaining to the farmers the benefits of selling surplus grain to the country and to themselves. After the vast number of farmers realized that selling grain would support industrial construction and strive for a bright socialist future, the enthusiasm for "selling patriotic grain" generally soared. The first to sell large quantities of surplus grain were Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Farmers participating in production cooperatives and mutual aid teams harvested more grain and sold more grain, setting an example for all farmers. Three or four thousand agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Northeast China, North China, Henan, Shaanxi, and other places took the lead in selling grain, promoting the grain selling movement. The actions of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, selling more than 1.8 million catties of surplus grain, and the collective grain selling of 984 agricultural production cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, were admired by the vast number of farmers. In Jianshe Village, Huachuan County, twelve farmers sold more than 10,000 catties of surplus grain each. "It is glorious to sell surplus grain" has become a new fashion in the countryside.

    Close integration with production is a prominent feature of the planned purchase movement. "Selling surplus grain to expand production" and "Supporting industrial construction" are resounding slogans in the rural grain selling movement. During the planned purchase, all parts of the country started by guiding farmers to "plan production," and finally formulated grain selling plans. In areas where the planned purchase work has basically ended, local Party committees and governments are leading farmers to carry out a production movement to welcome spring plowing.

    After the farmers were educated in the general line, their enthusiasm for participating in mutual aid and cooperation in production greatly increased. Based on this situation, the Party committees in various regions formulated plans for developing agricultural mutual aid and cooperation this year. The Party committees and government departments in various parts of Shanxi Province formulated plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives while formulating grain purchase plans. This year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide may increase from the existing 14,000 to about 45,000, and there will also be a great development of mutual aid teams. At present, the movement for farmers in various regions to participate in mutual aid and cooperation in developing production has gradually unfolded.

### 国家粮食计划收购获得巨大胜利  农民互助合作发展生产的积极性空前高涨

    国家粮食计划收购获得巨大胜利
    农民互助合作发展生产的积极性空前高涨
      【新华社二十八日讯】国家从去年十一月开始实行的粮食计划收购政策，由于中国共产党各级组织和各地人民政府的巨大努力和全国农民爱国热情的高涨，已获得巨大胜利。截至今年一月底的统计，国家从一九五三年七月开始在市场收购和计划收购的粮食总量，已占国家购粮计划的百分之八十五以上，其中最近三个月的收购量，超过了一九五二年十一月到一九五三年一月三个月的百分之一百二十六。从目前各地农民售粮情况看来，国家购粮计划可能超额完成。到一月底止，国家收购的粮食的数量，比去年同期增加了百分之七十以上，超过了解放以来任何一年的水平。
    我国有计划建设时期开始，各项建设蓬勃发展，要求国家能掌握充分的粮食，以保证供应各城市、工矿区、集镇以及广大农村中的缺粮户的需要，保障粮价稳定、支援工业建设。一九五三年我国粮食的产量已超过战前年产最高水平百分之十，比一九四九年解放初期，增产了百分之四十五以上，但由于我国农民习惯于“用一点钱、卖一点粮”，而且由于自由市场的存在和私商投机的影响，有“待价惜售”的心理，相当影响了国家购粮计划的完成。因此必须在全国范围内展开计划收购粮食的工作，动员有余粮农民把余粮的大部分卖给国家。这次计划收购的粮食只占农民手中余粮的一部分，而且价格公道，计划收购价格比一九五二年平均收购价格提高了百分之八左右。全国卖粮农民因此就增加了大约三万亿元的收入。
    各地在开展粮食计划收购运动时，首先是自上而下地召开干部会议，在干部了解了政策并经过重点试验取得经验后，再全面展开计划收购运动，这个运动的声势和规模，都可以和我国伟大的抗美援朝运动相比拟。全国参加粮食计划收购的有数百万干部。他们到达农村后，首先大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线，耐心地向农民说明出售余粮对国家和自己的好处。广大农民认识了出卖粮食支援工业建设和争取社会主义美好前途后，“卖爱国粮”的热情普遍高涨。首先出卖大批余粮的是共产党员、青年团员和参加互助合作组织的农民。参加生产合作社和互助组的农民，粮食打的多、卖的多，为全体农民树立了榜样。东北、华北、河南、陕西等地三、四万个农业生产合作社和互助组带头卖粮，推动了售粮运动。松江省桦川县星火集体农庄出售余粮一百八十多万斤和山西长治专区九百八十四个农业生产合作社集体卖粮的行动，受到广大农民的敬仰。桦川县建设村有十二户农民出卖余粮都在一万斤以上。“卖余粮光荣”已成为农村新的风尚。
    和生产密切结合是计划收购运动中突出的特点。“卖余粮扩大生产”和“支援工业建设”，是农村售粮运动中的响亮口号。全国各地在计划收购时，都从领导农民“打生产谱”着手，最后又订出了售粮计划。在计划收购工作基本结束的地区，当地党和政府就领导农民开展迎接春耕的生产运动。
    农民经过总路线的教育后，参加互助合作的生产积极性大大提高。中共各地党委根据这种情况拟订了今年发展农业互助合作计划。山西省各地党委和政府部门在制订粮食收购计划的同时，制订了发展农业生产合作社的计划。今年全国农业生产合作社由现有的一万四千多个可能发展到四万五千个左右，互助组也将有广大发展。目前，各地农民参加互助合作发展生产的运动已逐步展开。
