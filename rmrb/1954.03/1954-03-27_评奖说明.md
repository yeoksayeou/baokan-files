    Award Announcement

    I. The National Mass Song Award work for the past three years was conducted by the Mass Song Selection Committee established by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The Selection Committee consisted of Lü Ji (Chairman), Zhou Weizhi, Zhao Feng (Vice Chairmen), He Luting, Ma Sicong, Li Ling, Sun Shen, Ma Ke, He Shide, Li Huanzhi, Li Wei, Zhang Fei, Liang Hanguang, Tian Han, Guang Weiran, Yuan Shuipai, Tian Jian, Lin Mohan, An E, Song Zhidi, and Yan Wenjing, totaling twenty-one members. A working group was also established to assist in the work.

    II. A total of 208 mass songs were recommended by various regions to participate in the award, including works by 167 composers and 187 lyricists. Specifically:

      (1) A total of 111 songs were recommended by various regions based on major administrative areas (13 from North China, 19 from East China, 20 from Northeast China, 26 from Central and South China, 24 from Southwest China, 6 from Northwest China, and 3 from Inner Mongolia).

    (2) A total of 36 songs were recommended by various directly affiliated central units.

      (3) A total of 40 songs were recommended by the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government.

    (4) In addition, 29 songs were added by the Music Department of the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government based on the list of popular songs nationwide investigated by the National Musicians Association.

    The total number of mass songs above is 216. Among them, 8 songs were duplicates recommended by various regions, so the actual number is 208.

    III. Regarding the scope of mass songs: The songs sent to the central government for this award are diverse in form. In addition to mass unison songs, there are also choruses, medleys, solo songs, etc., as well as film scores and opera arias. After research by the Selection Committee, it was considered that mass songs are not limited to unison singing, but can also include many of the above forms. As long as the masses love to sing and can sing them, they are mass songs.

    IV. The issue of inconsistent levels of lyrics and melodies: Many songs are loved by the masses because of their good melodies, but their lyrics are often extremely empty. Some songs have high-level lyrics, but are not easily popularized due to poor melodies. Regarding this issue, the Selection Committee believes that the best mass songs should be works with both excellent lyrics and melodies. If the melody is very good but the lyrics are poor, or the lyrics are very good but the melody is poor, a lower award should be given.

    V. In the past, many mass songs played a certain propaganda role in coordinating with the political movements of the time and had a certain mass base. However, a considerable portion of them were forgotten by the masses after the movements because of their poor ideological and artistic qualities. Regarding the handling of such songs, the Selection Committee believes that their historical role should be affirmed, but the best mass songs should be works that can unify propaganda effect and artistic value. Those works with poor ideological and artistic qualities will not be awarded, but this does not negate their historical role.

    VI. Currently, many songs are created based on folk melodies. There are the following four situations for this type of work:

      (1) Organizing folk melodies, arranging harmony, and filling in new lyrics. Such as "Singing about Chairman Mao by the Fireside."

    (2) Comprehensive creation from several folk songs. Such as "From the Grassland to Beijing."

    (3) Development on the theme of a folk song. Such as "Beating the Jackals."

      (4) The melody is basically unchanged, mainly filling in new lyrics. Such as "Little Song of Free Marriage."

    For this type of song, the selection should mainly be based on the effort and effect of the adapter. As for songs adapted by ethnic minorities themselves, especially songs popular in ethnic minority areas, even those that use old folk songs with new lyrics should be rewarded as much as possible.

    VII. In terms of the award period, in order to achieve uniformity, works that are not published within the prescribed period will not be selected.

    VIII. A total of 114 works won awards, including 9 songs winning first prize (each song awarded a bonus of 5 million yuan, with 2.5 million yuan each for the composer and lyricist); 43 songs winning second prize (each song awarded a bonus of 3 million yuan, with 1.5 million yuan each for the composer and lyricist); and 62 songs winning third prize (each song awarded a bonus of 2 million yuan, with 1 million yuan each for the composer and lyricist).

    IX. There are as many as 10,000 mass songs published in various regions in the past three years. Although this selection was recommended from the bottom up, layer by layer, and the Music Department of the Art Affairs Administration Bureau made some additions, omissions are still inevitable due to the short selection time in various regions. If there are truly outstanding mass songs that have been omitted, they can be remedied in future mass song awards.

    X. The award-winning works will be compiled into a "Collection of Award-Winning Mass Songs" for promotion. Those that have not been made into records but are suitable for promotion will be recommended for record production.

    评奖说明
    一、三年来全国群众歌曲评奖工作，由中央人民政府文化部、中国文学艺术界联合会成立群众歌曲评选委员会负责进行。评选委员会由吕骥（主任委员）、周巍峙、赵沨（副主任委员）、贺绿汀、马思聪、李凌、孙慎、马可、何士德、李焕之、李伟、张非、梁寒光、田汉、光未然、袁水拍、田间、林默涵、安娥、宋之的、严文井共二十一人组成。另设立工作组协助工作。
    二、这次各地推荐参加评奖的群众歌曲计二百零八首。包括作曲者一百六十七人、作词者一百八十七人的作品。计：
      （一）各地以大行政区为单位推荐参加评选的共一百一十一首（华北十三首、华东十九首、东北二十首、中南二十六首、西南二十四首、西北六首、内蒙三首。）
    （二）中央各直属单位推荐参加评选的共三十六首。
      （三）中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部推荐参加评选的共四十首。
    （四）此外，由中央人民政府文化部艺术事业管理局音乐处根据全国音协调查的全国流行歌曲名单，提出补充的共二十九首。
    以上合计群众歌曲共二百一十六首。其中有八首因各地推荐时重复，故实为二百零八首。
    三、关于群众歌曲的范围问题。这次送来参加中央评奖的歌曲，在形式上是多样的，除群众齐唱歌曲外，还有合唱、联唱、独唱等等，且有电影插曲和歌剧曲等。经评选委员会研究，认为群众歌曲可不仅限于齐唱，也可包括上述的许多形式。只要是群众爱唱、能唱的，便是群众歌曲。
    四、歌词与曲调水平不一致的问题。不少歌曲因曲调较好而为群众所喜爱，但其歌词却往往异常空洞；也有部分歌曲的歌词水平较高，因曲调较差而不易流行。对这一问题，评选委员会认为，最好的群众歌曲应是曲词俱佳的作品。如曲调很好，歌词较差，或歌词很好而曲调不佳者，便应给予较低的奖。
    五、过去有不少群众歌曲，在配合当时的政治运动中曾经起过一定的宣传作用，也有一定的群众基础。但其中颇大的一部分由于思想性、艺术性均较差，运动过后即被群众遗忘。对这类歌曲的处理，评选委员会认为应该肯定其历史作用，但最好的群众歌曲，应是宣传作用与艺术价值能够统一的作品。对于那些思想性、艺术性较差的作品，虽不予给奖，但并非否定其历史作用。
    六、目前歌曲创作中，有不少是根据民歌曲调，进行加工创作的。这类作品有如下的四种情况：
      （一）将民间曲调加以整理，配置和声并改填新的歌词。如“炉边合唱毛主席”。
    （二）从几首民歌综合创作。如“草原到北京”。
    （三）在一首民歌的主题上发展。如“打豺狼”。
      （四）曲调基本上未动，主要是填配新词。如“自由结婚小唱”。
    对于这类歌曲，主要应根据改编者所费的劳力与效果来评选。至于少数民族自己改编的歌曲，特别是在少数民族地区流行的歌曲，即是利用旧民歌填上新词者，也尽可能予以奖励。
    七、在评选时限上，为求划一，凡不是在规定期限内发表的作品，一律不予评选。
    八、得奖作品共一百一十四首，计获一等奖歌曲九首（每首授予奖金五百万元，作曲、作词者各得二百五十万元）；二等奖歌曲四十三首（每首授予奖金三百万元，作曲、作词者各得一百五十万元）；三等奖歌曲六十二首（每首授予奖金二百万元，作曲、作词者各得一百万元）。
    九、三年来各地发表的群众歌曲有一万首之多。此次评选虽系从下到上，层层推荐，并由艺术事业管理局音乐处作了部分补充，但因各地评选时间短促，遗漏仍恐难免。如有确被遗漏的优秀群众歌曲，也可在将来的群众歌曲评奖中予以补救。
    十、得奖作品将编印为“评奖群众歌曲集”一册，以便推广。其未制唱片但适合推广者，将推荐制成唱片。
