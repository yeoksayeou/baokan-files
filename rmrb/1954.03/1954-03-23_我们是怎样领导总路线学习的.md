    How We Led the General Line Study
    The CCP Hebei Provincial People's Government Public Security Department Party Committee
    Under the leadership of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee and the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Party Committee, and due to the great importance attached to the study by the administrative leaders of our department, as well as the active efforts of the broad masses of cadres, the three-month-plus study of the General Line has yielded great results. Based on understanding the spirit and essence of the General Line, everyone has initially improved their work. In leading the study of the General Line, we have explored the following methods to continuously deepen the study:
    I. Make plans at all levels, especially good plans for study groups. We first made a plan for the entire department, and each branch studied specific measures to realize the plan based on this plan. The groups also conducted detailed discussions, combined with specific situations, to formulate specific study plans for the groups to carry out the study. This allows each cadre to clarify the direction and steps, have a clear understanding in their minds, and facilitate the exertion of consciousness and initiative in the study, and to carry out the study in a planned way. If we are only satisfied with the overall plan and do not have specific plans, it will often lead to waiting for arrangements every day, which wastes time and makes the study passive.
      II. Combining supervision, inspection, and testing. After the study plan and study system are formulated, in addition to strengthening ideological leadership and timely resolving ideological obstacles, regular inspections and supervisions are carried out. Our specific practices are: (1) Spot-checking notes to understand the learning situation (whether the documents have been carefully read, the degree of understanding, whether the learning focus is clear, etc.), so that everyone develops the habit of reading and taking notes, and gradually improves the method of taking notes (from excerpts, to recording key points, to recording learning experiences). This is of great help in consolidating the learning system and systematically understanding key issues. Now more than two-thirds of the comrades in our department who participate in theoretical study have taken study notes on the General Line, and some groups even have notes for each person.
  (2) In order to ensure one and a half hours of study every day from Monday to Thursday, in addition to uniformly formulating attendance books held by each group leader to take attendance, we also conduct unannounced in-depth inspections of the study situation in each group, and publish the inspection results, and conduct timely criticism and praise. (3) Conduct regular and irregular study tests. According to the study documents, we organize oral or written tests on key points after learning each issue. This method is very popular with everyone. On the one hand, it allows everyone to deeply study the documents, clarify the learning focus, and consolidate the learning results; on the other hand, it also helps the study leaders to understand the learning situation, so as to guide the study more effectively and deeply on this basis.
    III. Hold good discussion meetings. (1) Prepare well before the discussion meeting. We first determine the discussion questions for each section from top to bottom and from bottom to top according to the key points and requirements of the documents and the difficult problems raised by everyone in reading, and issue them to each group for discussion. Before the discussion, we also conduct research and deployment at the meetings attended by the propaganda committee members and study tutors of the branches, according to the key points and requirements of the discussion questions, in order to reach a consensus and have a clear understanding in mind, which is convenient for mastering the leadership. (2) After the discussion questions are determined, each group prepares separately, and everyone writes an outline of their speech, and then conducts the discussion. During the discussion, the tutors should be good at grasping the focus of the debate on the issue and induce everyone to start a heated debate. When the main issues are almost discussed, the tutor will make a comprehensive speech, affirming the correct opinions and appropriately criticizing the incorrect opinions, so as to facilitate everyone's systematic understanding of the issues and correct ideological understanding. In the discussion, it is necessary to prevent general discussions without preparation and without a center, or entanglement in trivial issues while relaxing the discussion of major issues. At the same time, issues that cannot be resolved in the discussion should be submitted to the leadership for answers. (3) When there are major differences of opinion on important issues, large-scale discussion meetings with full preparations can be organized for further in-depth research. For example, on the policy issues of the bourgeoisie, many confused concepts have been generated in the study. We have compiled five focus of debate and issued them to each group for full preparation. Each group selected representatives with different opinions to speak. After two days of debate, a consensus was finally reached, clarifying many confused concepts and gaining a lot.
    IV. Strengthen the learning leadership of cadres working outside. Since the number of cadres working outside is large, doing a good job in the study of cadres working outside has become an important issue. The methods we adopted are: (1) Before the cadres go out to work, we assign them learning tasks according to the length of their time working outside, and formulate a learning system (they must adhere to six hours of study every week and report to the sub-Party committee or branch once every ten days). When several people go out together, we organize them into study groups and appoint a group leader to lead the study. (2) The sub-Party committee or branch maintains frequent contact with the work group outside, and promptly sends them relevant materials such as study plans, study points, discussion questions, and thinking questions. They also report according to the prescribed system (including specific plans, learning situations, and difficult problems, etc.). The sub-Party committee also promptly puts forward opinions on the content of the report to help and supervise them. (3) After returning from working outside, the group leader will make a comprehensive learning report. Those with good results will be commended by each branch, and those with poor results will be criticized, and the direction of future efforts will be pointed out. The above methods have been very effective. The vast majority of cadres working outside can report on time, conscientiously adhere to the study system, and more than half of the comrades have taken study notes. When studying the grain policy, due to the close combination of study and work, the cadres working outside were generally able to correctly implement the grain policy and successfully complete the work tasks. Facts have proved that as long as the Party committee attaches importance to and strengthens specific leadership, the study of cadres working outside can be done well.
    V. Pay attention to linking with reality to achieve the purpose of improving and improving work. According to the instructions of the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Party Committee, the Public Security Department, on the basis of understanding the basic spirit of the General Line, adopted a top-down approach to make inspirational speeches linking work at all levels, that is, starting with the responsible comrades of each unit, then everyone learns to do it, and finally the leading comrades of the department make a summary report linking work, driving everyone to study in depth. Now, cadres at all levels have not only initially clarified the basic content and basic spirit of the General Line, but also clarified the importance of public security work for the implementation of the General Line, thereby improving everyone's work enthusiasm and initially improving our work.

    我们是怎样领导总路线学习的
    中共河北省人民政府公安厅分党委
    在中共河北省委和省直属机关党委的领导下，由于我厅行政负责同志对学习很重视，以及广大干部的积极努力，三个多月的总路线学习收获很大。大家在领会总路线精神实质的基础上，初步改进了工作。我们在领导总路线学习中，曾摸索出如下几个办法，使总路线的学习得以不断深入。
    一、层层订计划，特别是订好小组计划。我们首先订出全厅计划，各支部根据这个计划研究实现计划的具体措施，小组也经过详细讨论，结合具体情况制订小组的具体学习计划，进行学习。这样可使每个干部明确方向步骤，心中有数，便于发挥学习中的自觉性、主动性，并能有计划的进行学习。如果只满足于大计划而没有具体计划，就往往形成天天等待布置，既浪费了时间，又使学习陷于被动。
      二、督促、检查和测验相结合。在学习计划和学习制度制定后，除加强思想领导及时解决思想障碍外，并进行经常的检查督促。我们的具体做法是：（一）抽查笔记，了解学习情况（对文件是否认真阅读、领会程度如何、学习重点是否明确等），使大家养成阅读和记笔记的习惯，逐步改进记笔记的方法（从摘记，到记重点，直到记学习心得），这对巩固学习制度，系统领会重点问题帮助很大。现在我厅参加理论学习的同志有三分之二以上都作了总路线的学习笔记，有的组甚至每人都有笔记。
  （二）为了保证星期一至星期四每天一个半小时的学习，除统一制定签到簿由各组长掌握签到外，同时不定时地深入各组检查学习情况，并将检查结果公布，及时进行批评和表扬。（三）进行定期和不定期的学习测验。我们根据学习文件，在每学完一个问题时，按重点组织口头或文字测验。这种方法很受大家欢迎，一方面使大家深入钻研了文件，明确了学习重点，巩固了学习成果；另一方面也帮助学习领导上了解学习情况，以便在此基础上更加有效地深入指导学习。
    三、开好讨论会。（一）作好讨论会之前的准备工作。我们首先根据文件的重点、要求和大家在阅读中所提出的疑难问题，自上而下和自下而上地确定每节的讨论题，印发给各组讨论。讨论前，我们并根据讨论题的重点和要求，在支部宣传委员和学习辅导员参加的会议上，进行研究布置，以便取得一致意见，作到心中有数，便于掌握领导。（二）讨论题确定后，各组即分头进行准备，每人都写出发言提纲，然后进行讨论。讨论时辅导员要善于抓住问题的争论焦点，诱导大家展开热烈的争论。当主要问题讨论差不多时，辅导员即作综合性发言，肯定正确的意见，适当批判不正确的意见，便于大家系统地领会问题，端正思想认识。在讨论时必须防止无准备无中心的泛泛讨论，或纠缠于枝节问题而放松主要问题的讨论，同时对讨论中争执不下的问题应提交领导解答。（三）对重要问题有了重大分歧意见时，为了进一步深入研究，可组织有充分准备的大型讨论会。如对资产阶级的政策问题，学习中产生了许多糊涂观念，我们即整理了五条争论焦点，印发各组充分准备。各小组选出不同意见的发言代表，经过两天的论战，最后得到了一致的认识，澄清了许多糊涂观念，收获很大。
    四、加强外出干部的学习领导。由于外出工作干部人数很多，搞好外出工作干部的学习，就成为一个重要问题。我们采取的办法是：（一）干部外出工作之前，我们根据外出工作时间长短，分别给他们布置学习任务，订出学习制度（每星期必须坚持六小时学习，十天向分党委或支部作一次学习汇报）。数人一起出去时，我们给他们编好学习小组，指定组长领导学习。（二）分党委或支部经常和外出工作组保持联系，及时将学习计划、学习要点、讨论题和思考题等有关材料寄给他们，他们也按规定制度作汇报（包括具体计划、学习情况和疑难问题等），分党委并对汇报内容及时提出意见，以对他们进行帮助和督促。（三）外出工作回来后，由组长作全面学习汇报，成绩好的由各支部进行表扬，对不好的进行批评，并指出今后努力方向。采用以上办法效果很好，绝大多数外出工作干部都能按时汇报，认真坚持学习制度，并有一半以上同志作了学习笔记。在学习粮食政策时，由于密切结合工作进行学习，外出干部大都能正确地贯彻粮食政策，胜利地完成了工作任务。事实证明，只要党委重视，加强具体领导，外出工作干部的学习是可以搞好的。
    五、注意联系实际，以达到提高与改进工作的目的。公安厅根据省直属机关党委指示精神，在领会了总路线基本精神的基础上，采用自上而下做层层联系工作的启发发言，即先由各单位负责同志做起，然后大家都学习着做，最后由厅领导同志作联系工作的总结报告，带动大家深入学习。现在，各级干部不仅初步明确了总路线的基本内容和基本精神，而且明确了公安工作对实行总路线的重要性，从而提高了大家的工作积极性，并初步改进了我们的工作。
