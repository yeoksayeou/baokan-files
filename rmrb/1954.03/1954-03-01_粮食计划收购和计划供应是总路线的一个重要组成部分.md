    Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Grain are an Important Part of the General Line
    According to the "Order on Implementing Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Grain" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, starting from the fourth quarter of last year, a mass movement of selling and purchasing grain was launched in the vast rural areas of the country in conjunction with the publicity of the general line. In major and medium-sized cities, planned supply measures have also been implemented successively. Up to now, the grain purchase plan is nearing completion, and the supply work is also proceeding smoothly. The situation of purchasing less grain and selling more has changed, the behavior of speculators and profiteers in hoarding grain and driving up grain prices has been stopped, and the anxiety of urban and rural people about the state's inability to supply grain has been alleviated. This is a great victory on our grain front, another victory for the economic policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and also a victory in an important aspect of implementing the general line.
    The planned purchase and planned supply of grain is an important policy in the transition period. The planned purchase of grain means that, in addition to paying agricultural tax, surplus grain households (excluding grain-deficient households and self-sufficient households) must sell a certain amount of surplus grain to the state at a reasonable price stipulated by the state, and merchants are not allowed to buy grain from farmers. The planned supply of grain means that the state divides sales areas according to a certain price and sells the necessary grain to everyone in the cities and every grain-deficient household in the rural areas on time, and no one is allowed to hoard and speculate, let alone speculators and profiteers who exploit the urban and rural people. The policy of planned purchase and planned supply is formulated based on the current grain situation and the state's requirements for the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is in line with the current interests of the state and the people, and also in line with the long-term interests of the state and the people.
    What is the basic situation of grain in our country at present? Everyone knows that the grain situation is inseparable from the development of the urban and rural economy. In the past few years, the recovery and development of China's rural economy has been quite rapid, and grain production has increased year by year, and has exceeded the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, the current rural economy in our country is mainly a small-scale peasant economy. What kind of economy is a small-scale peasant economy? It is a consumption economy with extremely low commodity rates and mostly self-sufficient. This means that the commodity grain provided by the small-scale peasant economy is originally limited. In addition, the improvement of farmers' lives in the past few years has made many surplus grain households not urgently need to sell grain for turnover; especially the existence of the free market and the speculation and disruption of grain merchants have further encouraged the psychology of surplus grain households to hoard and wait for high prices and not be willing to sell grain quickly. On the other hand, our socialist industrialization is developing day by day, the urban and industrial population is increasing rapidly, the area of raw material crops is expanding year by year, and the demand for commodity grain is also increasing rapidly. Therefore, although the total grain output of the country has not decreased, as long as the dispatch is proper and the measures are appropriate, it is not only enough to eat and use, but also can have a slight surplus; however, after the autumn harvest last year, the state's plan to purchase grain still could not be completed on schedule in many areas, and grain sales far exceeded the plan, forming an imbalance between purchase and sales. Taking Shanxi Province as an example, last year's grain output increased by about 1.2 billion catties compared with 1952, and the agricultural tax and the state's grain purchase plan were only 200 million catties more than in 1952, but before the implementation of planned purchase, many places could not complete the purchase plan, and even could not catch up with the purchase volume in 1952. This shows the seriousness of the grain problem. If we do not take decisive measures to carry out unified and planned purchase and supply by the state, the state will not be able to control enough grain, and will not be able to guarantee the supply for the people's consumption; and if there is a shortage of grain in the market, it may cause price fluctuations, which will affect the normal progress of economic construction, and finally will put our country's economic life in serious difficulties.
    In terms of the state's socialist transformation of agriculture, the difficulties in purchasing and the imbalance between supply and sales in the grain market after the autumn harvest last year essentially reflected the contradiction between the state's planned economy and the small-scale peasant economy and the free market, and reflected the contradiction between the road of socialist industrialization and the spontaneous forces of the peasants and the capitalist road of the bourgeoisie's opposition to restriction. In the final analysis, it reflects the contradiction between socialist factors and capitalist factors. Therefore, if these contradictions are not fundamentally resolved, the grain problem cannot be completely solved. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have, on the one hand, strived to promote the mutual aid and cooperation and technical improvement of agricultural production, so as to increase grain production and gradually increase the speed of grain production development to a level sufficient to ensure the forward development of the national economy; on the other hand, they have taken the following measures throughout the country: First, implement the policy of planned purchase of grain from surplus grain households in rural areas; second, implement the policy of planned supply of grain to urban people and rural grain-deficient people; third, implement the policy of strict state control over the grain market and strictly prohibit private merchants from freely operating grain; fourth, implement the grain management policy of division of labor and responsibility between the central government and local governments under the unified management of the central government. These are all necessary measures to fundamentally solve the grain problem. Because the above policies are implemented, not only can the contradiction between grain supply and demand be properly resolved under the current conditions, but also prices can be stabilized more effectively, and it is conducive to the conservation of grain; and more importantly, as a result of the struggle between the state and grain speculators and the spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas, the free grain market is basically abolished, which will inevitably make the spontaneous forces in rural areas lose the free grain market as a basis, and to a large extent restrict the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas, and gradually bring the decentralized small-scale peasant economy into the orbit of the state plan in an important aspect, and will accelerate the promotion of farmers' awareness of socialism, and thus be able to promote the vast number of farmers to embark on the road of socialist transformation of mutual aid and cooperation. Therefore, the implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of grain is also an important measure for the socialist transformation of agriculture, and an indispensable part of the general line of the state during the transition period.
    The experience of planned purchase and planned supply of grain for more than three months has proved that our grain policy is completely correct, and the people of the whole country support and enthusiastically support this policy. Therefore, not only on the grain front, but also in the entire national economic life and the socialist transformation of agriculture, many victories have been achieved.
    In terms of the grain market situation, this is to eliminate the imbalance between purchase and sales. After the implementation of the planned purchase of grain, the amount of surplus grain sold by farmers and the amount of grain purchased by the state increased sharply. The amount of grain purchased in November 1953 increased by 85.52% compared with October, and increased by 72.22% in December compared with November, and increased by 137.34% compared with the same period in 1952, and increased by 325.14% in January this year compared with the same period last year. Judging from the current progress of grain purchase, the national grain purchase task can not only be completed, but also can be guaranteed to be exceeded. At the same time, due to the elimination of speculative grain merchants and the elimination of the tense atmosphere of grain, the sales volume of grain in various places has decreased according to a reasonable degree. Before the implementation of planned supply in Beijing, the supply of flour was very tight. After the implementation of planned supply, the actual monthly sales volume of flour decreased by 30% to 40% compared with before the planned supply. The situation of purchase and sales in other parts of the country is roughly the same.
    In terms of national economic life, due to the elimination of speculative grain merchants and the unification of grain purchase and sales by the state, the phenomenon of inconsistency between grain brand prices and market prices has been eliminated first. For example, after the new grain was put on the market last year, grain merchants in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao and other places rushed to purchase wheat, beans and oilseeds in Xuanhua, Hebei and other places, which once caused the local market price to be about 40% higher than the brand price; after the implementation of planned purchase and planned supply, this phenomenon was quickly stopped, and as a result, the vast number of urban and rural people were spared the losses caused by speculators and profiteers lowering prices and raising prices. Secondly, it makes it possible for the state to further improve the supply of grain. At present, in major cities, industrial and mining areas, and economic crop areas, the grain stored by the state exceeds the amount of grain stored in previous years, which can not only guarantee the current supply, but also is enough for the whole year. The unified plan for grain supply to rural areas and some disaster areas has also begun to be made now. Again, especially importantly, due to the stability of the grain market, the price stability in other areas is further guaranteed, and the price stability is one of the most basic conditions for planned economic construction.
    In terms of promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, through the publicity and education of the general line and the planned purchase and planned supply of grain, the socialist consciousness of farmers has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation and production has been improved. In recent years, with the development of the rural economy, the spontaneous capitalist forces of farmers have also increased. After a small number of farmers have accumulated some grain or other sideline income, they have gradually begun to engage in capitalist activities such as hoarding grain, hiring labor, lending usury and concurrently engaging in commerce. In Rongxian Special District of Guangxi Province, 91 seated merchants in a county town were changed from farmers. A militia captain in Jiangsu Province made a 100-word "five-year plan" and planned to become a rich peasant in three years and a landlord in five years. Another village cadre's "five-year plan" is: first hoard grain and lend money, then build houses and buy land, and change from a poor peasant to a rich peasant. Obviously, it would be very unfavorable to the country and the farmers if this trend were allowed to develop. After the publicity of the general line and the implementation of the planned purchase policy, the vast number of rural cadres and farmers were given the most extensive and profound socialist education, and many farmers who had confused ideas also became aware of it, and recognized the two roads of rural economic development. "It is glorious to work hard to produce more grain, and it is more glorious to sell surplus grain to the state to support national construction" has become the patriotic slogan of the vast number of farmers. At the three-level cadre meeting of various counties in Xinyang Special District of Henan Province, after the national transition period general line was conveyed, Li Tingkai, a representative of the 14th District of Xinyang County, said: "My family has more than 4,000 catties of surplus grain, and I originally wanted to use it to buy land and hire long-term workers. After this meeting, I feel clear in my heart. This capitalist road that makes most people suffer can no longer be taken, I want to take the road of everyone's prosperity. After I go back, I will definitely sell the surplus grain to the state." Obviously, this represents the thinking of the vast number of farmers. Therefore, in the areas where the planned purchase of grain has been completed, a new atmosphere of expanding production and organizing mutual aid and cooperation has emerged everywhere. The improvement of farmers' socialist consciousness and the higher enthusiasm for production, the role of which plays in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture in the future is immeasurable. Stalin said: "We must take all measures to raise the consciousness of the peasants, educate them, and bring them closer to the leader of our revolution - the working class, so that we will make the peasants a more firm and reliable ally of our proletariat." ("On the peasant, the ally of the working class") Practice has proved that these words have extremely profound practical significance for us.
    Now, as we announce the victory that has been achieved on the grain front, and as we initially summarize this victory, we must also point out that all the work in the past is only a beginning to successfully solve the grain problem. In a considerable period of time in the future, before the rural economy is completely collectivized, the grain problem will always be an important problem that cannot be ignored; our country's new grain policy is not a temporary measure, but a longer-term measure that the state must take during the transition to socialism. The planned purchase and planned supply work in front of us is still an extremely arduous task. Therefore, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have made, but should sum up the experience of implementing planned purchase and planned supply of grain this year, so as to create more favorable conditions for better implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of grain work in the future.

    粮食计划收购和计划供应是总路线的一个重要组成部分
    根据中央人民政府政务院“关于实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的命令”，从去年第四季度开始，在全国广大农村中结合总路线的宣传，展开了一个售粮和购粮的群众运动；在各大中城市里，也先后实行了计划供应的措施。截至目前为止，粮食收购计划已接近完成，供应工作的情况也很平稳。粮食工作中购少销多的情况变化了，投机奸商抢粮囤粮哄抬粮价的行为被制止了，城乡人民担心国家供应不上粮食的心情安定了。这是我们在粮食战线上的一个巨大胜利，是共产党和人民政府的经济政策的又一次胜利，也是在实行总路线中的一个重要方面的胜利。
    粮食的计划收购和计划供应，是过渡时期中的一项重要政策。粮食的计划收购，就是农民除了缴纳公粮以外，凡余粮户（缺粮户和不余不缺粮户不在内）必须按照国家规定的合理价格将一定数量的余粮卖给国家，并不许商人再向农民买粮食。粮食的计划供应，就是由国家按照一定的价格划分销区，按时卖给城市里的每个人和农村里的每个缺粮户以必需的粮食，不准任何人囤积居奇，更不准奸商投机倒把剥削城乡人民。计划收购和计划供应的政策，是根据目前粮食情况和国家对农业进行社会主义改造的要求而制定的，它既符合于国家与人民的目前利益，也符合于国家与人民的长远利益。
    现时我国粮食的基本情况是怎样的呢？谁都知道，粮食的情况是和城乡经济的发展密不可分的。过去几年来，我国农村经济的恢复和发展是相当快的，粮食产量逐年增加，并已超过抗战以前最高水平。但是我国目前的农村经济主要的还是小农经济。小农经济是什么样的经济呢？是商品率极低、多半自给自足的消费经济。这就是说：小农经济所提供的商品粮食本来是有限的。再加之几年来农民生活的改善，许多余粮户不急切需要出售粮食来进行周转；特别是自由市场的存在和粮商的投机捣乱，更助长了余粮户贮存观望、等待高价、不愿迅速出卖粮食的心理。而另一方面，我们的社会主义工业化事业正在日益发展，城市和工业人口迅速增加，原料作物区逐年扩大，对商品粮食的需要也随之迅速增大。因此，虽然全国粮食总产量没有减少，只要调度得法和措施恰当，不仅够吃够用，还能略有积余；可是去年秋收后却仍然出现了国家收购粮食的计划在很多地区不能按期完成，粮食销售却远远超出计划的情况，形成购销不平衡的局面。以山西省为例，去年粮食产量比一九五二年约增加十二亿斤，公粮与国家购粮计划只比一九五二年多二亿斤，但在实行计划收购以前，很多地方完不成收购计划，甚至赶不上一九五二年的收购量。这说明了粮食问题的严重性。我们如果不采取断然措施，由国家统一地有计划地进行收购和供应，国家就不能掌握足够的粮食，就不能保证对人民食用的供应；而如果市场粮食缺乏，就可能引起物价波动，就会影响经济建设的正常进行，最后就会使我们国家的经济生活处于严重困难的境地。
    就国家对农业进行社会主义改造来说，去年秋收后粮食市场上收购困难和供销不平衡的状况，其本质是反映了国家计划经济与小农经济和自由市场之间的矛盾，反映了社会主义工业化的道路与农民自发势力和资产阶级反限制的资本主义道路的矛盾，归根结蒂，是反映了社会主义因素与资本主义因素之间的矛盾。因此，如果不从根本上解决这些矛盾，也就不能彻底解决粮食问题。从去年第四季度起，中国共产党和人民政府一方面努力促进农业生产的互助合作化和技术改良，借以增产粮食，把粮食生产发展的速度逐步提高到足以保证国民经济向前发展的水平；另一方面，在全国范围内采取了如下的措施：一、在农村向余粮户实行粮食计划收购的政策；二、对城市人民和农村缺粮人民，实行粮食计划供应的政策；三、实行由国家严格控制粮食市场，严禁私商自由经营粮食的政策；四、实行在中央统一管理之下，由中央与地方分工负责的粮食管理政策。这些都是从根本上解决粮食问题的必要措施。因为实行了上述政策，不但在现在的条件下可以妥善地解决粮食供求的矛盾，更加切实地稳定物价，和有利于粮食的节约；而更重要的是由于国家与粮食投机商以及农村的资本主义自发势力作斗争的结果，基本上取缔了粮食的自由市场，就必然使农村的自发势力失去了粮食自由市场做依据，在很大的程度上限制农村资本主义自发势力的发展，而在一个重要方面把分散的小农经济逐步地纳入国家计划的轨道之内，并将加快地促进农民对于社会主义的觉悟，因而也就能够促进广大农民加快地走上互助合作的社会主义改造的道路。所以，实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应，也是对农业实行社会主义改造的一个重要措施，是国家过渡时期总路线的一个不可缺少的组成部分。
    三个多月来，粮食计划收购和计划供应的经验，证明了我们的粮食政策是完全正确的，全国人民都是拥护和热情支持这个政策的。因而，不仅在粮食战线上，而且在整个国家经济生活和农业的社会主义改造方面都取得了很多的胜利。
    表现在粮食市场情况方面，这就是消除了购销不平衡的局面。实行粮食的计划收购以后，各地农民出售余粮和国家收购粮食的数量猛然提高，一九五三年十一月份比十月份的粮食收购量增加了百分之八十五点五二，十二月份又比十一月份增加了百分之七十二点二二，比一九五二年同期增加了百分之一百三十七点三四，今年一月份比去年同期增加了百分之三百二十五点一四。从目前的购粮进展情况来看，全国粮食收购任务不但可以完成，还可以保证有所超过。与此同时，由于取缔了投机粮商和消除了粮食的紧张空气，各地粮食销售量则按照合理的程度下降。北京市实行计划供应以前，面粉供应的情况是很紧张的，实行计划供应以后，每月实销面粉量较计划供应前减少了百分之三十至四十。购销情况的这种变化，对进一步作好粮食供应工作创造了良好的条件。全国其他各地的情况亦大体与此相同。
    表现在国家经济生活方面，由于取缔了投机粮商和由国家统一了粮食的购销工作，因而首先就消灭了粮食牌价和市价不一致的现象。例如去年新粮上市后，天津、北京、上海、青岛等地的粮商，纷纷到河北宣化等地抢购小麦、豆类和油料，曾造成当地市价高于牌价百分之四十左右的情况；实行计划收购和计划供应后，这种现象很快地就被制止了，结果就使得广大城乡人民避免了由于奸商压价、抬价而遭致的损失。其次，就使国家有可能进一步作好粮食的供应工作。目前，在各大城市、各工矿地区以及经济作物地区，国家储存的粮食，超过了历年的存粮数量，不仅可以保证目前的供应，也足够全年的供应。对农村及一些灾区的粮食供应，在现在也已开始作出了统一的计划。再次，特别重要的，就是由于粮食市场的稳定，从而也就更加保证了其它方面的物价稳定，而物价的稳定，乃是进行有计划的经济建设的最基本的条件之一。
    表现在促进农业的社会主义改造方面，就是通过总路线的宣传教育和粮食的计划收购与计划供应工作，大大地提高了农民的社会主义的觉悟，和提高了互助合作和生产的积极性。几年来，随着农村经济的发展，农民的资本主义自发势力也随之增长，少数农民积存了一些粮食或其它副业收入后，就逐渐开始了囤粮、雇工、放高利贷和兼营商业等等资本主义活动。广西省容县专区一个县城内，有九十一个座商是由农民改业的。江苏省一个民兵队长订了个一百字的“五年计划”，打算三年作富农，五年当地主。另一个村干部的“五年计划”是：先囤粮放债，再盖房买田，由贫农变成富农。显然的，如果听任这种趋势发展下去，对国家对农民都是十分不利的。经过总路线的宣传和贯彻计划收购政策以后，给广大农村干部和农民进行了一次最广泛最深刻的社会主义教育，很多有过糊涂思想的农民也都觉悟过来了，认清了农村经济发展的两条道路。“劳动生产多打粮食光荣，将余粮卖给国家支援国家建设更光荣”，已成为广大农民爱国主义的行动口号。河南省信阳专区各县三级干部会议上，传达了国家过渡时期总路线以后，信阳县第十四区代表李廷恺说：“我家有余粮四千多斤，原想拿来买田地，雇长工。这个会一开，我心里亮堂了。这条使大多数人受苦的资本主义道路再也不能走了，我要走大家富裕的道路。回去后，我一定把多余的粮食卖给国家。”显然的，这是代表着广大农民的思想的。因此，在完成了粮食计划收购的地区，到处出现了扩大生产和组织互助合作的新气象。农民社会主义觉悟的提高和生产情绪的更加高涨，这对今后农业的社会主义改造所起的推动作用是无法估计的。斯大林说：“我们要采取一切办法来提高农民的觉悟，教育他们，使他们靠近我国革命的领袖——工人阶级，这样，我们就会使农民成为我国无产阶级更坚定的更可靠的同盟者。”（“论工人阶级的同盟者农民”）实践证明，这些话对我们具有极深刻的现实意义。
    现在，当我们宣布在粮食战线上已经取得的胜利，当我们初步总结这个胜利的时候，我们也必须指出：过去的一切工作，还只是顺利解决粮食问题的一个开端，在今后一个相当长的时期内，当农村经济完全实现集体化以前，粮食问题将始终还是一个不可忽视的重要问题；我们国家这一新的粮食政策，也不是一个临时性的措施，而是国家在向社会主义过渡时期中所必需采取的一项较长期的措施，摆在我们面前的计划收购和计划供应工作，仍然还是一项极其艰巨的任务。因此，我们绝不能满足于既得的成绩，而应该很好地总结今年实行粮食计划收购和计划供应的经验，为今后更好地实行粮食计划收购和计划供应工作创造更为有利的条件。
