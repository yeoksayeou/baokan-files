A Commentary on Newspaper Work

    From Agricultural Economic Propaganda to Discuss Why Newspapers Must Have a Clear Line
    Dong Qian
    According to inspections of newspapers in various regions, reports on various economic tasks such as industry, agriculture, and commerce in the past generally conformed to the spirit of the general line and played a certain role in promoting the realization of the general line and general tasks of the transition period. However, the level of our economic construction propaganda still cannot keep up with the requirements of practical work. This is mainly manifested in the fact that many economic construction reports still lack a clear line and cannot effectively mobilize people to participate in the economic construction of the motherland wholeheartedly.
    How can we make the economic construction propaganda of newspapers have a clear line? Where does a clear line come from? The clear line of economic construction propaganda of newspapers is to clarify the direction of economic development according to the general line of the Party and the country and the specific lines of various economic tasks, through typical examples, point out the paths and methods of advancing along this direction, in order to guide and mobilize people to fight for the continuous growth of socialist economic components through correct paths and methods.
    Lenin, in the statement of the editorial department of "Iskra", when saying that newspapers cannot become a simple accumulation of various viewpoints, pointed out: "We will guide it in the spirit of precise and definite direction. This direction can be expressed by the word Marxism." [Note 1] Stalin also told us in the inaugural issue of "The Struggle": "The Social Democratic newspaper must always give clear answers to all issues related to the workers' movement, ... and illuminate every phenomenon encountered by workers with the light of scientific socialism." [Note 2] These teachings of the great revolutionary leaders of the world proletariat show that only by illuminating the direction and path for people to move forward with the light of socialism and pointing out the methods of work can the party's newspapers and periodicals play their role as collective propagandists, agitators, and organizers, and can they have a clear line. Otherwise, it will become: "A journal without direction is an absurd, clumsy, ugly, and harmful thing." [Note 3]
    To guide people in the direction of socialism and mobilize people
    Taking agricultural economic propaganda as an example, to clearly indicate the direction of agricultural economy, we must, from the perspective of scientific socialism, clearly point out to people that the agricultural economy must gradually realize socialist transformation. In the current period, it is to "rely on the consolidated alliance of poor and middle peasants, gradually develop mutual aid and cooperation, and restrict rich peasant exploitation." [Note 4] in order to further "realize our ultimate goal in the countryside—to guide all peasants towards socialism and communism" [Note 5]. Therefore, in agricultural economic propaganda, newspapers should mobilize peasants to support the road of mutual aid and cooperation and take the socialist road based on this basic policy of the Party, in order to gradually transform the backward, small-scale production of the individual economy into the advanced, large-scale production of the cooperative economy; it should mobilize peasants to oppose the capitalist road and oppose the spontaneous trend of capitalism, so as to restrict and gradually eliminate the exploitation of rural capitalism.
    In the past, many newspapers made many reports on the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural economy propaganda, and played a certain role in promoting practical work. However, some newspapers did not always grasp this policy and conduct specific and in-depth propaganda and education to the broad masses of peasants. Therefore, many reports lack a clear direction and do not clearly indicate "what to support and what to oppose".
    For example, some newspapers, during the spring plowing last year, because they opposed the blind and rash advancement of mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas, rarely publicized or abandoned the publicity of the direction of mutual aid and cooperation, and even encouraged farmers to "go it alone." Some newspapers, in view of the serious agricultural socialist ideology existing among peasants after the land reform, thought that promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement might also fuel this erroneous ideology, so they mistakenly "dared not promote" the direction of mutual aid and cooperation, and only vaguely promoted "everything for production." As for how to develop production and what production is for, they did not "give clear answers." These practices are obviously wrong. One of the important reasons for the emergence of blind and rash advancement and agricultural socialist ideology is that some peasants and rural work cadres do not have a deep understanding of the correct mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, the way to prevent or correct these deviations should not be not promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement and giving up eating because of choking; but should be to deeply promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement and point out its specific methods.
    In addition, although some newspapers vigorously promoted the activities of temporary mutual aid groups and year-round mutual aid groups last year, they rarely further promoted agricultural production cooperatives on this basis. The publicity of exemplary state-owned farms was even more neglected. The reports of these tasks must be greatly strengthened this year.
    In the propaganda of agricultural production, water conservancy construction, loans, disaster relief, etc., newspapers mostly promote the achievements of these tasks and the "benefits" given to peasants, and the peasants' gratitude to the government; they rarely use these typical examples to explain what the long-term interests of peasants are, so as to enlighten and improve the socialist consciousness of peasants. Some newspapers even failed to point out that this was the result of neglecting socialist education, abandoning leadership, and neglecting the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy when some mutual aid groups seriously affected its development due to the growth of spontaneous capitalist tendencies. The newspapers did not do this, which also reflects that the newspapers themselves abandoned "leadership", abandoned "advancement", and abandoned the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy.
    Lenin said that the propaganda and agitation of daily newspapers should have a real communist nature. This requirement put forward by Lenin for newspapers is equally applicable to our party newspapers in the transition period. Our agricultural economic propaganda also lacks a clear line and direction, lacks ideological and combative power, and lacks agitation, and thus causes some dissatisfaction among the masses, who feel that newspapers cannot solve their problems precisely because it lacks a real communist nature.
    To oppose bourgeois ideology with a clear combativeness and irreconcilability
    The lack of a clear direction in newspapers is not only manifested in the fact that they are not resolute and thorough in "supporting what", but also lacks a clear combativeness and irreconcilability in "opposing what". Some newspapers have shown such shortcomings in mobilizing peasants to oppose the capitalist road, oppose the spontaneous trend of capitalism, and restrict and gradually eliminate the exploitation of rural capitalism. Before October last year, they rarely exposed or even "dared not report" the capitalist spontaneous forces that had already begun to rise in rural areas, such as the phenomenon of buying and selling green seedlings and land, lending money at usurious rates, and hoarding grain. Some newspapers also one-sidedly emphasized "ensuring peasants' ownership of the means of production" and "freedom of lending" and "freedom of hiring labor." These propaganda efforts have objectively fueled the tendency of spontaneous capitalist forces and even encouraged rural usury, leading the masses in the wrong direction.
    The Party teaches us that building socialism in the countryside is to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, restrict and gradually eliminate the exploitation of rural capitalism, and enable agriculture to gradually change from a backward small-scale production of the individual economy to an advanced large-scale production of the cooperative economy. This is the greatest and most profound social transformation in our country's countryside. In such a great transformation, we must of course respect the peasants' ownership of their land property, but the private ownership of basic means of production in agriculture, like the private ownership of other means of production, will be gradually transformed into collective ownership on the basis of voluntary association of peasants, so the slogan of "ensuring" peasants' private ownership of the means of production is wrong. The unrestricted capitalist "freedom of lending" and "freedom of hiring labor" cannot but be gradually restricted and eliminated. Therefore, our newspapers must closely follow the general line of the Party, maintain a high degree of vigilance on the ideological front, timely correct any deviations from the general line, and oppose the bourgeois ideological system with the unique combativeness and irreconcilability of the Party newspaper, and consolidate the socialist ideological system. "Being dominated by the bourgeois ideological system is to exclude the socialist ideological system." [Note 6] During the period of building socialism, newspapers must not ignore this serious ideological struggle.
    To clearly answer people: How should we build socialism?
    Past practice has proven that if newspapers' economic construction propaganda is to have a clear line, it is not only necessary to guide and mobilize people in the direction of socialism, but also to clearly answer people: the paths and methods of how to build socialism. When Lenin delivered a speech at the All-Russian Political Education Work Conference of the Provincial and County People's Education Bureaus in 1920, he said: "The old-style propaganda is to narrate and illustrate what communism is. Now this old-style propaganda is no longer applicable anywhere, because it is necessary to show from practice how to build socialism. All propaganda should be based on the political experience of economic construction..." [Note 7] These words of Lenin after the October Revolution have great practical significance both for our ideas on running newspapers during the transition period and for the methods of economic construction propaganda.
    For example, in agricultural economic propaganda, we should not only narrate and illustrate what agricultural collectivization or socialization is, but more importantly, after pointing out this direction, clearly tell people the paths and methods of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture and gradually transitioning to socialism. The Central Committee's resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation made in December 1951, and the Central Committee's resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives announced in January this year, clearly outline the correct path and specific methods for carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture.
    The correct paths and specific methods mentioned here are, in general, the path of "actively leading, steadily advancing", from small to large, from low to high, and gradually cooperativizing, which is the method of "starting from the current production status of the small-scale peasant economy" and transforming the small-scale peasant economy. However, some newspapers did not clearly reflect the correct paths and specific methods stipulated by the Party in the publicity of mutual aid and cooperation because they did not clearly understand the direction of agricultural economic development, and inappropriately emphasized that the mutual aid groups changing from large to small (even collapsing) is a normal phenomenon. The reports did not further analyze the reasons why these mutual aid groups changed from large to small (even collapsed), nor did they clearly point out how to develop from small to large and from low to high. In the publicity of implementing the policy of "actively leading, steadily advancing", some newspapers made greater efforts in opposing the tendencies of rash and reckless advancement, implementing the "three major principles", adhering to "steady progress" and "starting from the current production status of the small-scale peasant economy", and played a certain role in promoting the steady development of mutual aid and cooperation. However, there was little reporting and criticism of the right-leaning phenomenon of letting things drift, only "steady progress" but not "advancement", which existed at the same time in the work and later grew. Our newspapers should, of course, start from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, such as decentralization, private ownership, conservatism, regional differences, and the conservative psychology and the psychology of worrying about gains and losses of peasants arising from these characteristics, and patiently and earnestly persuade them in the publicity of transforming the individual small-scale peasant economy and developing mutual aid and cooperation; but they must also adopt an active leadership attitude, and must not adopt a passive and laissez-faire attitude, and must also point out the correct, bright, and broad path of socialist transformation to the small-scale peasant economy, and must not only be satisfied with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy. Only by adopting this correct attitude and approach can our newspapers' agricultural economic propaganda correctly and clearly reflect the Party's path and methods for carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, and thereby play the role of the collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer of newspapers in the struggle for the gradual transition of national agriculture to socialism.
    The inspection results of many newspapers show that if economic construction propaganda is to have a clear line, it should use clear and vivid examples to correctly indicate the direction, path, and methods of economic development. In 1946, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), when requiring newspapers to regularly explain the various tasks of the new five-year plan and mobilize the working masses to complete and overfulfill the five-year plan, pointed out in this way: "...newspapers should use clear and convincing examples to show the economic and cultural development prospects of the states, the ways and means of improving labor productivity in the basic sectors of the national economy, to fight for the fastest development of the leading economic sectors, ...to point out the ways to overcome the difficulties encountered in solving economic and political tasks." [Note 8] The above-mentioned principles and methods put forward by Lenin, Stalin, and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for the propaganda and agitation of Soviet newspapers are powerful weapons for overcoming the lack of a clear line in newspaper propaganda from the perspective of newspaper management thought. This has begun to prove to be effective in our practice. Taking the recent publicity of grain purchase and mutual aid and cooperation in many newspapers as an example, precisely because there is a relatively clear line, pointing out the direction of socialism and criticizing the spontaneous capitalist tendencies, the peasants feel that "there is a way out" and "there is hope", and understand "what to support and what to oppose", thereby improving the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in selling grain to the state, expanding production, and participating in mutual aid and cooperation. For example, the Anhui Daily's report on November 6 last year on the mechanical farming farm using tractors to help Li Shulan's mutual aid group plant wheat, precisely because it reflected the peasants' dissatisfaction with the small-scale peasant economy and the idea of ​​demanding to take the socialist road, the educational role for the peasants and the promotion role for the work were relatively large. There are many such vivid examples in other newspapers. This shows that once the economic construction propaganda of newspapers has a clear line, it can more fully exert its combat power during the period of building socialism.

### 从农业经济宣传来谈报纸一定要有明确的路线

    从农业经济宣传来谈报纸一定要有明确的路线
    董　谦
    据各地报纸的检查，过去关于工业、农业、商业等各项经济工作的报道，一般地说，都还符合总路线的精神，并对实现过渡时期总路线总任务起了一定的推动作用。但我们经济建设宣传的水平，还是赶不上实际工作的要求的。这主要表现在不少经济建设报道还缺乏明确的路线，不能有力地动员人们奋不顾身地参加祖国经济建设工作。
    怎样才能使报纸的经济建设宣传具有明确的路线？明确的路线又从何而来？报纸经济建设宣传的明确的路线，就是根据党、国家的总路线和各项经济工作的具体路线，通过典型事例阐明经济发展的方向，指出循着这个方向前进的道路和方法，以引导和动员人们经过正确的道路和方法，为争取社会主义经济成份的不断增长而斗争。
    列宁在“火星报”编辑部的声明中说到报纸不能变成各种各样观点的简单的堆积时，指出：“我们将以精确肯定的方向的精神引导它。这个方向可以用马克思主义这个字表现出来。”〔注一〕斯大林在“斗争报”创刊号中也告诉我们说：“社会民主党的报纸必须对一切有关工人运动的问题经常给以明确的答复，……并以科学社会主义的光芒照耀工人所遇到的每一种现象。”〔注二〕世界无产阶级伟大革命领袖的这些教导表明，党的报刊只有用社会主义的光芒照亮人们前进的方向和道路，指出工作的方法，才能发挥自己作为集体的宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的作用，也才能具有明确的路线。否则，就会成为：“没有方向的杂志，便是荒谬的、笨拙的、丑恶而有害的东西。”〔注三〕
    要以社会主义的方向引导人们，动员人们
    以农业经济宣传为例，要明确地表明农业经济的方向，就必须以科学社会主义的观点，向人们明确地指出农业经济必须逐步实现社会主义改造，在目前时期是“依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削”。〔注四〕以便进一步“实现我们在农村中的最后目的——引导全体农民走向社会主义和共产主义”〔注五〕。因此，报纸在农业经济宣传中，就应该根据党的这一基本方针动员农民起来拥护互助合作道路，走社会主义道路，以便逐步地把落后的小规模生产的个体经济变为先进的大规模生产的合作经济；就应该动员农民起来反对资本主义道路，反对资本主义自发趋势，以限制和逐步排除农村资本主义的剥削。
    很多报纸，过去在农业经济宣传中，对发展互助合作运动都作了不少报道，并在实际工作中起了一定的推动作用。但是也有一些报纸，它们并不是经常都掌握了这个方针，并向广大农民群众进行具体的深入的宣传教育。因而很多报道缺乏明确的方向，没有明确表明“拥护什么和反对什么”。
    例如，有的报纸，在去年春耕时，因为反对农村中互助合作的盲目冒进偏向，就很少宣传或者放弃了宣传互助合作方向，甚至鼓励农民去“单干”。有的报纸鉴于土地改革后农民中存在着严重的农业社会主义思想，就以为宣传互助合作运动也可能助长这种错误思想，于是错误地“不敢宣传”互助合作方向，而只笼统地宣传“一切为了生产”。至于怎样才能发展生产，发展生产又是为了什么，却都没有“给予明确的答复”。这些作法，显然都是错误的。产生盲目冒进偏向和农业社会主义思想的重要原因之一，就是由于某些农民和农村工作干部对正确的互助合作运动没有深刻的认识。因此，防止或纠正这些偏向的办法，不应该是不宣传互助合作运动，因噎废食；而正应该深入地宣传互助合作运动，并指出它的具体作法。
    另外，有些报纸在去年虽然大力宣传了临时互助组、常年互助组的活动，但却很少在这一基础上再进而宣传农业生产合作社。对于示范性的国营农场的宣传就更被忽视了。这些工作的报道，在今年必须大大加强。
    对农业生产、兴修水利、贷款、救灾等方面的宣传，报纸多是宣传这些工作的成就及其所给予农民的“恩惠”，和农民对政府的感激；很少通过这些典型事例说明什么是农民的长远利益，从而启发和提高农民的社会主义觉悟。有些报纸甚至在某些互助组由于滋长起自发的资本主义倾向而严重影响到它的发展时，也没有指出这是忽视社会主义教育的结果，这是放弃领导的结果，这是忽视对小农经济改造的结果。报纸没有这样去作，也反映了报纸本身放弃了“领导”，放弃了“前进”，放弃了对小农经济的改造。
    列宁说过，日报的宣传和鼓动，应当带着真正的共产主义的性质。列宁对报纸所提出的这个要求，对于我们过渡时期的党报来说，同样是完全适用的。我们的农业经济宣传，也正是因为缺乏真正的共产主义的性质，所以缺乏明确的路线和方向，所以缺乏思想性、战斗性、鼓动性，并从而引起一些群众的不满，觉得报纸不能解决他们的问题。
    要以鲜明的战斗性和不调和性反对资产阶级思想
    报纸缺乏明确的方向，不仅在“拥护什么”方面表现得不坚决不彻底，同样在“反对什么”方面也缺乏鲜明的战斗性和不调和性。有些报纸在动员农民起来反对资本主义道路、反对资本主义自发趋势，限制和逐步排除农村资本主义的剥削方面，就曾表现了这样的缺点。在去年十月份以前，它们对于农村中已经开始抬头的资本主义自发势力，如买卖青苗和田地、放高利贷、囤积粮食的现象，是很少揭发甚至“不敢报道”的。有些报纸还片面地强调了“确保农民生产资料所有制”以及“借贷自由”、“雇工自由”等等。这些宣传，都在客观上助长了资本主义自发势力的倾向，甚至鼓励了农村的高利贷，而把群众引导到错误的方向。
    党教导我们说，在农村中建设社会主义，就是要发展互助合作运动，限制和逐步排除农村资本主义的剥削，使农业能够由落后的小规模生产的个体经济逐步地变为先进的大规模生产的合作经济，这是我国农村中一个最伟大最深刻的社会变革。在这样的大变革中，我们当然必须尊重农民对于他们的土地财产的所有权，但是农业的基本生产资料的私有制也和其他生产资料的私有制一样，是要在农民自愿联合的基础上逐步转变为集体所有制，因此提出“确保”农民生产资料私有制的口号就是错误的。对于那种不受限制的资本主义的“借贷自由”、“雇工自由”，更不可能不逐步受到限制和排除。因此，我们的报纸必须紧紧遵循着党的总路线，在思想战线上保持高度的警觉性，及时纠正脱离总路线的任何偏差，并以党报特有的战斗性与不调和性，反对资产阶级思想体系，巩固社会主义思想体系。“受资产阶级思想体系支配就是排斥社会主义思想体系”。〔注六〕在建设社会主义时期，报纸是决不能忽视这个严重的思想斗争的。
    要明确地答复人们：应该怎样来建设社会主义
    过去的实践证明，报纸的经济建设宣传要有明确的路线，不仅要以社会主义的方向去引导人们，动员人们，并且要明确地答复人们：应该怎样来建设社会主义的道路和方法。列宁在一九二○年的省、县人民教育局全俄政治教育工作会议上发表演讲时说：“旧式的宣传是叙述和举例说明什么是共产主义。现在这种旧式宣传无论那里也不适用了，因为需要从实践中表明应当怎样来建设社会主义了。一切宣传都应该建立在经济建设的政治经验之上……”〔注七〕列宁在十月革命后说的这些话，无论对于我们在过渡时期的办报思想来说，也无论对于经济建设宣传的方法来说，都有极大的现实意义。
    例如，在农业经济宣传中，我们就不应该只是叙述和举例说明什么是农业集体化或社会主义化，而更重要地是在指出这一方向之后，明确地告诉人们对农业实行社会主义改造、逐步过渡到社会主义的道路和方法。中央一九五一年十二月所作的关于农业生产互助合作的决议，以及今年一月公布的中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，就清楚明确地规划出对农业实行社会主义改造的正确道路和具体办法。
    这里所说的正确道路和具体办法，在一般的情况下，就是“积极领导，稳步前进”，由小到大，由低级到高级，逐步合作化的道路，就是“从小农经济的生产现状出发”又对小农经济实行改造的办法。可是，有些报纸由于对农业经济发展的方向认识不明确，在互助合作宣传中就没有明确地体现党所规定的正确道路和具体办法，而不适当地强调了互助组由大变小（甚至垮台）是正常的现象。报道中既没有进一步分析这些互助组由大变小（甚至垮台）的原因是什么，又没有明白指出应该如何由小发展到大，由低级发展到高级。在贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”这一方针的宣传中，有些报纸曾在反对急躁冒进偏向、贯彻“三大原则”、坚持“稳步”和“从小农经济的生产现状出发”方面，作了较大的努力，并对稳步发展互助合作起了一定的推动作用。但是对于如何提高农民互助合作积极性和社会主义觉悟，以及对于工作中同时存在的和后来滋长的放任自流、只“稳步”而不“前进”的右倾现象，则很少进行报道和批判。我们的报纸对于改造个体的小农经济和发展互助合作的宣传，固然应该从小农经济的分散性、私有性、保守性、地域差别性以及由这些产生的农民的守旧心理和患得患失心理等特点出发，耐心地循循善诱；但也必须采取积极领导的态度，而不能采取消极放任的态度，也必须给小农经济指出社会主义改造这一条正确的光明的广阔的出路，而不能只安于小农经济的现状。只有采取这种正确的态度和作法，我们报纸的农业经济宣传，才能正确地、明确地体现党对农业实行社会主义改造的道路和办法，并从而发挥报纸在为全国农业逐步过渡到社会主义而斗争中的集体宣传者、鼓动者和组织者的作用。
    很多报纸的检查结果表明，经济建设宣传要有明确的路线，就应当用鲜明的和生动的事例来正确地表明经济发展的方向、道路和方法。一九四六年，联共（布）中央在要求报纸经常解释新五年计划的各项任务，动员劳动群众来完成和超额完成五年计划时，就曾这样指出：“……报纸应当用鲜明的和令人信服的例子来表明州的经济文化发展前途，表明国民经济基本部门中提高劳动生产率的途径和手段，为主导的经济部门最迅速发展而斗争，……指出克服在解决经济政治任务中所遇到的困难的途径。”〔注八〕上述列宁、斯大林以及联共（布）中央对苏联报纸宣传和鼓动所提出的原理、原则和方法，是从办报思想上克服报纸宣传缺乏明确路线的有力武器。这在我们的实践中已开始证明是行之有效的。就以最近不少报纸对粮食收购、互助合作的宣传来说，正因为有了比较明确的路线，指出了社会主义的方向，批判了自发的资本主义倾向，使农民感到“有了出路”，“有了奔头”，明白了应该“拥护什么，反对什么”，因而提高了广大农民爱国售粮、扩大生产和参加互助合作的积极性。如去年十一月六日安徽日报对机耕农场用拖拉机帮助李树兰互助组种麦的报道，也正因为反映了农民对小农经济不满，要求走社会主义道路的思想，所以，对农民的教育和对工作的推动作用就比较大。在其他报纸上也有不少这样生动的例子。这说明，报纸的经济建设宣传一旦有了明确的路线，就能在建设社会主义时期更充分地发挥它的战斗力量。〔注一〕“列宁全集”俄文版第四版，第四卷，第三二九页。〔注二〕“斯大林全集”第一卷，人民出版社版，第七页。〔注三〕“列宁全集”，俄文版第四版，第三十四卷，第三八○—三八一页。〔注四〕“中国共产党中央委员会关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”。〔注五〕中国共产党中央委员会一九五一年十二月所作的“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”。〔注六〕斯大林：“略论党内意见分歧”，“斯大林全集”第一卷，人民出版社版，第八十六页。〔注七〕“列宁全集”俄文版第四版，第三十一卷，第三四六页。〔注八〕联共（布）中央“关于改进‘锤’（顿河岸上罗斯托夫市），‘伏尔加公社’（古比雪夫市）与‘库尔斯克真理’各州报的办法”。
