Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: The "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition," organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, after half a year of preparation, will officially open in Beijing in early April.

    The purpose of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in holding the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition" is to promote and disseminate the technological innovation experience of various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the important advanced experience in the basic construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company to the whole country, so as to further promote the labor emulation campaigns carried out in various places and ensure the completion and over-completion of the state's economic construction plan.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the Party and with the specific help of Soviet experts, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has carried out tremendous technological innovation work in production. For example, the successful smelting of low-silicon iron from sintered ore, the promotion of Soviet advanced experiences such as the "smooth operation method of full air and fast charging" and "rapid steelmaking method" in ironmaking, have greatly improved the labor productivity of various factories and mines, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. In the autumn of 1952, after Zhang Mingshan, an old worker of a small rolling mill, successfully created the "anti-surround disc," the technological innovation of various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel Company formed a mass movement, achieved great achievements, and guided the majority of employees from the past shock-style physical labor emulation to a competition movement that paid great attention to reforming production technology. Due to the development of this movement, the labor productivity of various factories and mines in Anshan Iron and Steel Company has been improved, production costs have been reduced, product quality has been improved, and labor conditions have been greatly improved, enabling the state's production plan and increase production and practice economy plan for 1953 to be overfulfilled.

    The "Anshan Iron and Steel Technology Innovation Exhibition" will be exhibited in the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, and the content will be divided into two pavilions: "Technology Innovation" and "Basic Construction." At present, the installation of exhibits, real objects and models of these two pavilions is nearing completion. When the exhibition opens, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions will invite delegations of leading cadres of party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as advanced producers, labor models, veteran workers, and engineering and technical personnel from factories and mines across the country, to come to Beijing to visit and study the experience of technological innovation and basic construction in Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

    “鞍钢技术革新展览会”四月初将在京揭幕
   【新华社二十一日讯】中华全国总工会举办的“鞍钢技术革新展览会”，经半年来的筹备，将于四月初在北京正式揭幕。
    全国总工会举办“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的目的，是为了把鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿中的技术革新经验和鞍钢基本建设中的重要先进经验，向全国推广和传播，以便把各地开展的劳动竞赛向前推进一步，保证完成和超额完成国家的经济建设计划。
    几年来，鞍山钢铁公司在党的领导和苏联专家的具体帮助下，进行了巨大的生产技术革新工作。如炼制烧结矿低矽铁的成功，炼铁中“全风快料顺行操作法”和“快速炼钢法”等苏联的先进经验的推广，使得各厂矿的劳动生产率大大提高，为国家创造了大量财富。一九五二年秋天，小型轧钢厂老工人张明山创造“反围盘”成功以后，鞍钢各厂矿的技术革新形成了群众性的运动，获得了重大成就，并引导广大职工由过去带突击性的拼体力的劳动竞赛变成十分注意改革生产技术的竞赛运动。由于这一运动的开展，鞍钢各厂矿都提高了劳动生产率，降低了生产成本、提高了产品质量，并大大改善了劳动条件，使一九五三年的国家生产计划和增产节约计划得以超额完成。
    “鞍钢技术革新展览会”将在北京劳动人民文化宫展出，内容分为“技术革新”和“基本建设”两个馆。目前这两个馆展览品的实物和模型的安装工作接近完成。展览会开幕时，全国总工会将邀请全国各地厂矿企业包括党、行政、工会、青年团的领导干部及先进生产者、劳动模范、老工人和工程技术人员的代表团，前来北京参观学习鞍钢技术革新的经验和基本建设的经验。
