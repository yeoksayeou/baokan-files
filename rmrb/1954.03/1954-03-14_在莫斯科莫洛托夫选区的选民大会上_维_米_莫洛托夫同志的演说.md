    Comrades, first of all, let me express my heartfelt gratitude to you and to all the voters of the Molotov Constituency who have nominated me as a candidate for Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, for granting me such a high honor and trust (applause).
    I will regard it as my primary duty, as the duty of a Communist Party member, to live up to your trust, comrades, voters! (Applause)
    The foundation of our Party's achievements is the unwavering trust of the working people in it. We should all cherish this trust. Every Communist Party member has a sacred duty to strive to deepen this trust further, to serve his people honestly, and to unite the working people around our Party, the Central Committee of the Party, and the Soviet Government (prolonged applause).
    You have all seen the Party Central Committee's letter to all voters, which summarizes the achievements of the Soviet people's work in recent years and puts forward tasks for the future in domestic and foreign policy.
    These achievements can be seen first of all in the development of industry. It is enough to point out that, for example, in 1953, the Soviet people's total industrial production exceeded that of 1940, the pre-war year, by 150 percent.
    We all remember Lenin's teaching: Heavy industry is the foundation for a prosperous national economy and the foundation for national defense.
    The Soviet people have achieved important successes in this area. This can be illustrated with simple figures.
    In 1953, we produced 38 million tons of steel and 320 million tons of coal, both twice as much as in 1940. In 1953, electricity production was three times that of 1940, and the production of machinery and equipment was almost four times that of 1940. These facts demonstrate the powerful surge of our heavy industry. We have been able to achieve these results due to the increasing development of construction, the development of transportation, the continuous improvement of the technological foundation of our entire national economy, and, of course, the unprecedented increase in the number of our cadres.
    At the same time, thanks to the achievements in developing heavy industry, it has been possible to vigorously promote the production of consumer goods and to begin vigorously developing agriculture.
    In a series of resolutions, the Party and the government have proposed measures to accelerate the expansion of the food and light industries in every possible way, and also to increase the production of daily necessities. The results of these measures were already clearly visible in the second half of last year, when the goods circulating in our retail trade network increased significantly. We have also made various efforts to improve the quality of goods, expand their variety, improve supply, and fully satisfy consumers' interests. Nearly 300 new consumer goods factories began production in 1953 alone.
    The existing food and light industry enterprises are largely being re-equipped with new machinery.
    The further development of our industry depends in many ways on better utilizing the untapped potential in industry, relying on production reserves.
    For example, who doesn't know that the work of our enterprises is hot and cold on many occasions, and therefore not efficient enough? In the metallurgical industry, the coal mining industry, the chemical industry, the food factories, and the light industry enterprises, especially in the machine manufacturing industry, the work efficiency in the first ten days of a month is usually much lower than at the end of the month. Is this situation tolerable? Is it normal, in our opinion, that the production level reached by an enterprise in the last ten days of a month is always reduced again at the beginning of the next month? However, if our administrative staff, engineers and technicians, and all our Party organizations and other organizations strive to ensure that the work of each enterprise proceeds at a strictly balanced pace, and that the production level is not lowered at the beginning of the month, then they can greatly improve the work of the enterprise and ensure a further significant increase in industrial products. In this respect, Muscovites should also set a good example and let everyone know how it should be done.
    Now, the Party and the government are paying special attention to the issue of accelerating agricultural development. The Party Central Committee's September Plenum and the Party Central Committee's recently concluded Plenum have greatly promoted this work.
    The Party is vigorously implementing the task of accelerating the development of animal husbandry and vegetable cultivation, as well as further increasing the production of industrial raw material crops. At the same time, the Party and the government tell us that the foundation of the entire agricultural production must be the further, great development of grain cultivation, maximizing grain production.
    We cannot be satisfied with the achievements already made in agriculture. We should not close our eyes to the fact that the development of agriculture has lagged behind the development of our industry and the needs of the rapidly growing population. Therefore, our Party has put forward the following urgent, nationwide task: in the next two to three years, on the basis of the strong development of socialist industry, to meet the growing needs of our people for consumer goods, and to ensure a rapidly expanding light industry and food industry with raw material supply.
    The Party believes that the main task remains to increase the yield per unit area in various regions of the country. At the same time, it has stipulated the task of increasing grain production by reclaiming new land.
    Therefore, we must reclaim a total area of at least 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River basin, and parts of the North Caucasus in the next two years.
    This year, 120,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and many other agricultural machines and automobiles have been transported to machine tractor stations and state farms to reclaim new land. The victorious completion of this task will guarantee an increase of more than one billion poods of grain on these lands in 1955.
    Important measures are now being taken to ensure the further development of agriculture.
    The production of tractors and agricultural machinery has reached a high level. In addition, machines of ever-changing styles are currently being adopted, which will greatly reduce the labor of collective farms and state farms and greatly increase labor productivity.
    The Party knows that the victorious completion of every national economic task depends on cadres, depends on living people, so the Party pays great attention to the issue of cadres and is striving to strengthen the cadre lineup of machine tractor stations and provide experts for collective farms.
    In addition, the Party and the government are taking important measures to give collective farms and collective farmers economic incentives, which are necessary for the development of agriculture. As everyone knows, measures such as changing the purchase prices of certain agricultural products and adjusting agricultural taxes, as well as certain other measures, have already been implemented. This will require the state to pay a large amount of funds and materials, including funds for building machine tractor stations and expanding livestock houses.
    In implementing all these measures, including the new measures to give collective farms and collective farmers economic incentives, the principle on which the Party and the government are based is that it is necessary to further strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry and ensure the leading role of the working class.
    The great Lenin said:
    "The supreme principle of the dictatorship is to maintain the alliance of the proletariat and the peasantry in such a way that the proletariat can retain its leadership and state power."
    J.V. Stalin, the great successor of Lenin's cause, in expounding Lenin's doctrine on the worker-peasant alliance, said:
    "Lenin taught us that the alliance of the working class and the peasantry is the fundamental principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We should not forget this. ... And the dictatorship of the proletariat relies on the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. Therefore, if we destroy or weaken the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, then all our tasks will hang in the air."
    We must never forget that, in the current situation, this Leninist principle has not lost its greatest political significance. We must remember this, and we must pay attention to consolidating the Leninist alliance of the working class and the collective peasantry, because this alliance is the foundation of the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the entire Soviet society, and therefore also the foundation of its strength and invincibility (stormy applause).
    The Party has inspected the situation in agriculture and once again directed our attention to the shortcomings existing in the work of state organs.
    Constant contact with the people, the study of important details of a certain issue, and a deep and concrete understanding of practical problems have been replaced by bureaucratic methods high above, and endless paper instructions and orders. This situation cannot be tolerated. The Party has made a demand of all of us: criticism of shortcomings, especially criticism from those with practical experience from below, should not be suppressed; leaders of agencies and organizations should listen to this criticism and draw timely and appropriate conclusions from it.
    The overall development of our country's economy is the foundation for improving the welfare of the working people and continuously increasing the real wages of workers and staff and the income of collective farmers. Since the war, the prices of manufactured goods and food have been reduced six times in a row. Today, everyone sees that the policy of reducing prices is not some temporary or transitional measure, but one of the main foundations of the entire economic activity of the Soviet state (applause).
    We already have the possibility of greatly expanding trade. In the past year alone, 21 percent more goods were sold to the people than in the previous year. The Communist Party and the government have decided to vigorously improve the organization of Soviet trade and service to urban and rural consumers.
    Building houses for the working people is a matter of constant concern to our Party and government. We have had to use a great deal of strength and resources to rebuild cities and villages destroyed during the enemy occupation. After the war, houses with a construction area of more than 183 million square meters have been built for workers and staff in cities and industrial areas. During the same period, more than 4 million houses were built in rural areas for collective farmers and rural intellectuals. However, we still lack houses, and we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Our task is to further expand housing construction in order to further greatly improve the living conditions of the people.
    The cultural needs of our people are growing rapidly. We must do our best to expand the construction of schools, hospitals, children's institutions, and cultural institutions.
    Our Party has shown constant concern for the development of the socialist culture of all nationalities of the Soviet state. In our country, more than 57 million people are studying. Doesn't this one fact explain many things? Last year, there were 220,000 graduates from institutions of higher learning, and this number will increase this year.
    We cannot but be happy about the rapid upsurge of our country's cultural forces and the continuous development of the socialist culture of all nationalities.
    We are proud of the achievements of Soviet science and engineering, and Soviet art and literature. Our scientists are playing an increasingly leading role in the progress of world science. In terms of the achievements in obtaining atomic energy, our scientists and engineering workers have clearly shown how much the strengthening of the Soviet state's power and the increase of its international prestige depend on their efforts and practical achievements (applause).
    The history of our country shows that the victory of socialism is very important for the destiny of all nationalities.
    In the era of the old bourgeois-landlord system, the state could not be maintained without inciting hostility between nationalities, without carrying out colonial oppression against all nationalities, without provoking conflicts between the Armenian and Turkish nationalities, without anti-Semitism, and so on. The October Socialist Revolution ended this shameful situation and paved the way for the free development of all nationalities and their cultures. The fraternal friendship of all nationalities in our country is being consolidated day by day.
    Take the relationship between Russia and Ukraine as an example.
    As everyone knows, in the old days, no one mentioned the issue of launching mass celebrations of the 100th, 200th and other anniversaries of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia. In the case of the forced Russification of Ukraine, no one would have raised this issue. Now, in the case of the free development of Soviet nationalities, the situation is different. In the socialist Soviet state, this year we are commemorating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine and Russia, and we regard it not only as a festival of the Ukrainian and Russian nationalities, but also as a solemn festival of all Soviet nationalities (applause).
    Significant changes have taken place in the international situation recently.
    We naturally cannot ignore that the aggressive forces are still following the old path. The arms race is still continuing. The military budgets of the countries of the aggressive bloc remain extremely large. The production of atomic weapons is underway. The United States is still establishing military bases in European countries and countries outside Europe, with their spearheads pointing at the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.
    In the area of international trade, the restrictions and absurd discriminatory policies that were adopted in the past against the Soviet Union, People's China, and other people's democracies are still largely in effect. Due to the increasingly obvious signs of economic crisis in the capitalist countries and the increasing number of unemployed people, pursuing this aggressive policy, which runs counter to the vital interests of many countries, is causing increasing divisions within the imperialist bloc and is increasingly suffering setbacks.
    Comparing the current situation with the situation a year ago, we cannot but point out that some progress has been made in easing international tensions.
    The fact of the Korean armistice is enough to prove this. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement marked the failure of the policy of the aggressive group that launched the Korean War. Three years of war and great sacrifices did not destroy the heroic Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and their glorious achievements will forever be recorded in the history of the national liberation struggle (prolonged applause). The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement is a victory for the entire peace and democracy camp.
    We also cannot ignore that the recently held Berlin Conference finally broke the situation of not holding great power conferences for many years. On the other hand, the Berlin Conference itself took an important step by recognizing the need to convene a conference in Geneva with representatives from the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, as well as representatives from other countries, to jointly discuss the unresolved Korean issue and the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The people of Indochina have been fighting a long-term struggle for their freedom and national rights.
    The Soviet people welcome the fact that the People's Republic of China will occupy its legitimate position at the conference together with several other major powers (prolonged applause). In this way, the international situation makes the restoration of the Chinese people's rights in resolving pressing international issues and the restoration of the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations even more necessary and more urgent.
    The Soviet Union's foreign policy has played a great role in promoting the achievements already made in easing international tensions. The aim of this policy of the Soviet Union is to further ease international tensions and consolidate world peace (prolonged applause). At the same time, the Soviet Union is promoting cooperation and developing business relations with all countries on the basis of mutual benefit, as long as they are willing to do so.
    The recently concluded Berlin Conference of the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union paid special attention to the German issue.
    It is now clear that the governments of France, Britain, and the United States are not currently proposing the task of restoring German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. Therefore, they are not interested in concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The European plan of the three Western countries is currently inseparable from the attempt to establish the so-called "European Army" of six Western European countries. The "European Army" will actually be controlled by the revived West German armed forces. Therefore, this plan to remilitarize West Germany is leading to the revival of German militarism.
    Of course, the Soviet Union cannot agree to this method of resolving the German issue.
    Like other peace-loving European countries, the Soviet Union opposes the plan to revive German militarism and any efforts to re-establish German armed forces commanded by Nazi generals. On the other hand, it is very clear that the remilitarization of West Germany is in line with the interests of German revanchists and militarists who are attempting to prepare for a new war in Europe.
    In response to the plan to establish a new military group of European countries, the Soviet Union has put forward its own proposals for guaranteeing the collective security of the peoples of European countries.
    The Soviet government put forward a draft of the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe" at the Berlin Conference. The purpose of this draft is to guarantee the peace and security of all European countries, regardless of their social systems. Reaching an agreement on this issue would greatly promote peace in Europe and at the same time ease international tensions.
    While putting forward the draft of the All-European Treaty, the Soviet delegation pointed out that various amendments could be made to this draft, as long as the principle of collective security for the peoples of European countries is recognized. Many criticisms of this draft so far have not diminished the peaceful value of the Soviet proposal.
    For example, it is said that it is inappropriate for the United States not to join the European Collective Security Treaty. However, during the Berlin Conference, no one said that the corresponding amendments proposed to the draft could not be considered.
    Some people also say that the European Collective Security Treaty may create unpleasant advantages for countries like the Soviet Union, because it is stronger than other European countries. However, the Soviet Union has not demanded to occupy any special position in the European collective security system.
    Of course, these and other possible opinions and amendments should be given due attention and can be considered in further discussions of this draft.
    The Soviet Union's draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe" provides a practical and feasible path to guaranteeing security. It is incompatible with the attempt to establish a military group of European countries leading to a new war in Europe. This draft is a tool for uniting the peoples of European countries to consolidate peace and international security (stormy applause).
    The Soviet Union is unswervingly striving to consolidate world peace. But we know that conspiracies against the peace-loving Soviet Union have not stopped. We should not ignore that reactionary forces are openly pursuing a policy of preparing for a new war. Therefore, in order to ease international tensions, the Party and the government have to pay attention to doing their best to consolidate the power of the Soviet state, and to further unswervingly consolidate and improve the Soviet armed forces that defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the security of our country (stormy, prolonged applause).
    Today, the powerful democratic and socialist camp is defending peace together with the Soviet Union. The great alliance and fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people has strengthened the forces of peace in the Far East and the world (applause).
    The fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic are being strengthened day by day. The peace, democracy, and socialism camp has the strong support of millions of active peace fighters in other countries, and is receiving increasing support from the people of all countries.
    The elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR are a general test of the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. This election also brings the Soviet people closer to the Communist Party and the government.
    The alliance of Party members and non-Party members, which demonstrates the increasingly close ties between our Party and the broad masses of the working people and demonstrates the unity of our people around the Party, is growing stronger! (Stormy, prolonged applause)
    The great unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the heroic Soviet people is being consolidated and strengthened day by day (Stormy, prolonged applause)
    Long live the Communist Party, the leading and guiding force of Soviet Society! (Stormy and continuous applause)
    Long live the great Soviet people, the builders of communism!
  (Stormy and sustained cheers. All stand)

### 在莫斯科莫洛托夫选区的选民大会上  维·米·莫洛托夫同志的演说

专栏：

    在莫斯科莫洛托夫选区的选民大会上
    维·米·莫洛托夫同志的演说
    同志们，首先让我向你们和提名我为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的莫洛托夫选区的全体选民表示由衷的感谢，感谢你们给我这样崇高的荣誉和信任（鼓掌）。
    我要把不辜负你们的信任当作我的首要责任，当作一个共产党员的责任，同志们，选民们！（鼓掌）
    我们的党的成就的基础就是劳动人民对它的不可动摇的信任。我们大家应该珍视这种信任。每一个共产党员都负有神圣的责任，要努力使这种信任继续加深，要老老实实地为他的人民服务，把劳动人民团结在我们的党、党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围（经久不息的掌声）。
    你们大家都看到了党中央委员会的告全体选民书，其中总结了近几年来苏联人民工作的成果，并提出了今后在国内和外交政策方面的任务。
    这些成果首先可以从工业的发展中看到。指出一点就足以说明了，例如，一九五三年，苏联人民的工业总生产量超过了战前一九四○年的百分之一百五十。
    我们都记得列宁的遗训：重工业是繁荣国民经济的基础，是国防的基础。
    苏联人民在这方面取得了重要的成就。这一点可以用简单的数字加以说明。
    一九五三年，我们生产了三千八百万吨钢和三亿二千万吨煤，两者都为一九四○年的两倍。一九五三年，电力产量为战前一九四○年的三倍，机器和设备的产量差不多为战前一九四○年的四倍。这些事实证明了我们的重工业的强大高涨。我们之所以能够取得这些成绩是由于建设事业的日益发展，由于运输的发展，我们整个国民经济的技术基础的不断提高，自然，也由于我们的干部数目的空前增加。
    同时，由于发展重工业方面的成就，才有可能大力推进日用品生产和着手大力发展农业。
    党和政府在一系列的决议中，提出了以种种可能的方法来加速扩大食品工业和轻工业、并同样增加日用品生产的措施。这些措施的结果在去年下半年已经可以清楚地看出，那时在我们的零售贸易网流通的货物已大大增加了。我们也作了各种努力来提高货物的质量，扩大它们的种类，改进供应并充分满足消费者的兴趣。单在一九五三年就差不多有三百家新的日用品工厂开始生产。
    原有的食品工业和轻工业企业在很大程度上正用新式机器改装。
    我们工业的进一步发展在许多方面要依靠更好地利用工业中还没有发掘的潜力，依靠生产的后备力量。
    例如，谁不知道我们企业的工作在许多场合下时冷时热，因而效率不够高呢？在冶金工业、采煤工业、化学工业、食品工厂和轻工业的各企业，特别是机器制造工业中，一个月中照例总是头十天的工作效率比月底的要低得多。难道这种情况是可以容忍的吗？一个企业在一个月的后十天所达到的生产水平到下月初又总是降低下去，难道我们认为这种情况是正常的吗？但是，如果我们的行政人员、工程师和技师，我们所有的党组织和其他组织尽力保证各企业的工作按照严格的均衡的速度进行，不准在月初降低生产水平，那么，他们就可以大大地改进企业的工作，并保证工业产品进一步大大地增加。在这一方面，莫斯科人也应该树立一个好榜样，让大家知道应该怎样做。
    现在，党和政府特别重视加速农业发展的问题。党中央委员会九月全体会议和党中央委员会最近结束的全体会议，大大推动了这个工作。
    党已经在大力执行加速饲畜业和蔬菜种植的发展速度的任务，以及进一步提高工业原料作物产量的任务。同时，党和政府告诉我们，整个农业生产的基础必须是谷物种植的进一步的、大大的发展，把谷物产量尽量提高。
    我们不能满足于农业已经取得的成就。我们不应该闭着眼睛不看事实：农业的发展已经落后于我们工业的发展和人民的迅速增长的需要了。因此，我们党提出了下列迫切的、全国性的任务：在今后两三年中，在社会主义工业的强大发展的基础上，满足我国人民对日用品的不断增长的需要，并且保证以原料供应迅速扩大的轻工业和食品工业。
    党认为主要的任务仍然是提高国内各地区的单位面积产量。同时，它规定了用开垦新地的方法来增加谷物产量的任务。
    因此，我们必须在今后两年中，在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域各区，以及北高加索的部分地区开垦总面积至少达一千三百万公顷的处女地和荒废的土地。
    今年已把十二万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和其他许多农业机器以及汽车，运往机器拖拉机站和国营农场去开垦新地了。这个任务的胜利完成，将保证一九五五年在这些土地上增产十亿普特以上的谷物。
    现在正在采取重要的措施来保证农业的进一步发展。
    拖拉机和农业机器的生产已达到高度的水平。此外，目前正在采用日新月异的式样的机器，这种机器将大大减轻集体农庄和国营农场的劳动并将大大提高劳动生产率。
    党知道每一个国民经济任务的胜利完成，都取决于干部，取决于活的人，因此党非常注意干部问题，并正在努力设法加强机器拖拉机站的干部阵容和为集体农庄提供专家。
    此外，党和政府正在采取重要措施来给予集体农庄和集体农民以经济上的鼓励，这对于农业的发展是必要的。大家知道，像改变若干农产品的征购价格和调整农业税这样的措施和其他某些措施已经付诸实施了。这将需要国家付出大量的款项和物资，包括兴建机器拖拉机站和扩大牲畜房的经费在内。
    在执行所有这些措施（包括给集体农庄和集体农民以经济鼓励的新措施）时，党和政府所根据的原则是：有必要进一步加强工人阶级和农民的联盟，保证工人阶级的领导作用。
    伟大的列宁说：
    “专政的最高原则就是维持无产阶级与农民的联盟，使无产阶级能够保持自己的领导作用和国家政权。”
    列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林在阐释列宁关于工农联盟的学说时说：
   “列宁教导我们，工人阶级和农民的联盟，乃是无产阶级专政底基本原则。我们不应该忘记这一点。……而无产阶级专政是依靠于工人阶级与农民的联盟。因此，要是我们破坏或削弱工人阶级与农民的联盟，那我们的一切任务便悬在空中了。”
    我们决不要忘记，在目前的情况下，这个列宁主义的原则没有失去它的最伟大的政治意义。我们必须记住这一点，必须注意巩固工人阶级和集体农民的列宁主义的联盟，因为这个联盟是整个苏维埃社会的精神上和政治上的牢不可破的团结的基础，因此也就是它的强大和不可战胜的基础（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    党检查了农业中的情况，再度引导我们注意国家机构的工作中所存在的缺点。
    和人民的经常联系，对某一问题的重要细节的研究，对实际问题的深刻的、具体的了解，这些都被高高在上的官僚主义的方法，永无休止的纸上指示和命令所代替了。这种情况决不能容忍。党向我们大家提出了要求：对缺点的批评，特别是来自下面的有实际经验的人的批评，不应受到压制，机关和组织的负责人应该倾听这种批评，并从这种批评中得出及时的、适当的结论。
    我国经济的总的发展是增进劳动人民福利、不断增加职工的实际工资和集体农民收入的基础。战后，制成品和食品的价格已经接连减低六次。今天，大家都看到，减低物价的政策并不是某种暂时的、过渡性的措施，而是苏维埃国家整个经济活动的主要基础之一（掌声）。
    我们已经有了大大扩大贸易的可能性。单在去年，卖给人民的货物就比前年多百分之二十一。共产党和政府已经决定大力改进苏维埃贸易的组织和对城乡消费者的服务。
    为劳动人民建筑房屋是我们的党和政府经常关怀的事情。我们曾不得不把很大的力量和资源用来重建在敌人占领时期受到破坏的城市和乡村。战后在城市和工业区已为职工们建筑了建筑面积达一亿八千三百多万平方公尺的房屋。在同一时期，农村中为集体农民和农村知识分子建筑了四百多万幢住宅。但是，我们还缺乏房屋，我们不能满足于已有的成就。我们的任务是进一步扩大房屋建筑，以便进一步大大改善人民的居住条件。
    我们人民的文化需要正在迅速增长。我们必须尽力扩大学校、医院、儿童机关和文化机关房屋的建筑。
    我们的党对苏维埃国家各族人民的社会主义文化的发展表现了经常的关怀。在我们国家中，有五千七百多万人在学习。单是这一个事实不是就可以说明许多问题了吗？去年高等学校的毕业生有二十二万人，今年，这个数目还会增加。
    我们不能不对我国文化力量的迅速高涨和各族人民社会主义文化的不断发展感到高兴。
    我们以苏维埃科学和工程、苏维埃艺术和文学方面的成就感到自豪。我们的科学家在世界科学的进展中所起的领导作用越来越大。就获得原子能这一方面的成就来说，我们的科学家和工程方面的工作者已经清楚地表明了：苏维埃国家力量的加强和它的国际威望的提高，是多么有赖于他们的努力和实际成就（鼓掌）。
    我们国家的历史说明，社会主义的胜利对各民族的命运是非常重要的。
    在过去资产阶级—地主制度的时代，国家如果不靠煽动各族人民之间的敌视，不靠对所有民族进行殖民压迫统治，不靠挑拨亚美尼亚民族和土耳其民族之间的冲突，不靠反犹太民族主义等等，就不能维持下去。十月社会主义革命结束了这种可耻的情况，为各族人民和它们的文化的自由发展铺平了道路。我国各族人民的兄弟般的友谊正在一天比一天巩固。
    以俄罗斯和乌克兰之间的关系为例。
    大家知道，在旧时代，没有人提过关于发动人民群众广泛庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯一百周年、二百周年和其他周年的问题。在强迫实行乌克兰俄罗斯化的情况下，是不会有人提出这个问题的。现在，在苏维埃各民族自由发展的情况下，情况就不同了。在社会主义苏维埃国家中，今年我们正在纪念乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年，我们不但把它当作是乌克兰民族和俄罗斯民族的节日，而且把它当作是苏联各民族的隆重节日（鼓掌）。
    近来国际形势已发生了显著的变化。
    我们自然不能忽视，侵略势力仍在走过去的老路。扩充军备仍在继续进行。侵略阵营各国的军事预算仍然异常庞大。原子武器的生产正在进行中。美国仍在欧洲各国和欧洲以外的国家建立矛头指向苏联和各人民民主国家的军事基地。
    在国际贸易方面，过去对苏联、人民中国和其他人民民主国家所采取的限制和荒谬的歧视政策大部分仍在实行。由于各资本主义国家内的经济危机的征兆日益明显，失业人数日益增加，奉行这种和许多国家的切身利益背道而驰的侵略政策，使帝国主义阵营内部日益分裂，日益遭到失败。
    拿现在的情况和一年以前的情况比较一下，我们不能不指出，在缓和国际紧张局势方面已经获得了某些进展。
    朝鲜停战这一事实就足以证明。朝鲜停战协定的签订标志着发动朝鲜战争的侵略集团的政策的失败。三年的战争和重大的牺牲没有摧毁英雄的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，他们的光荣业绩将永垂民族解放斗争的史册（经久不息的掌声）。朝鲜停战协定的签订是整个和平民主阵营的胜利。
    我们也不能忽视，不久前举行的柏林会议终于打破了持续多年的长期不举行大国会议的局面。另一方面，柏林会议本身采取了一个重要的步骤，认为有必要在日内瓦召开美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国代表，以及其他国家代表的会议，来共同讨论尚未完全解决的朝鲜问题以及恢复印度支那和平的问题。印度支那的人民为争取他们的自由和民族权利进行了长期的斗争。
    对于中华人民共和国将在会议上和其他几个大国一起占有它的合法地位这一事实，苏联人民表示欢迎（经久不息的鼓掌）。这样，国际局势使得恢复中国人民在解决迫切的国际问题上的权利，以及恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的权利的事情，更加必要、更加迫切了。
    苏联的外交政策对于在缓和国际紧张局势方面已取得的成就，起了巨大的促进作用。苏联的这一政策的目的是要进一步缓和国际紧张局势，巩固世界和平（经久不息的掌声）。同时，苏联正在促进在互利的基础上和所有国家合作并发展事务关系，只要它们愿意这样做。
    不久前结束的法、英、美、苏四国外长柏林会议特别注意德国问题。
    现在事情很清楚，法国、英国和美国三国政府目前并未提出在民主与和平的基础上恢复德国统一的任务。因此，他们对于缔结对德和约是不感兴趣的。三个西方国家的欧洲计划目前和建立六个西欧国家的所谓“欧洲军”的企图是分不开的。“欧洲军”实际上将受到复活起来的西德武装部队的控制。因此，这种使西德重新军国主义化的计划是导向德国军国主义的复活的。
    当然，苏联不能同意这种解决德国问题的方法。
    和其他爱好和平的欧洲国家一样，苏联反对复活德国军国主义的计划和重新建立由纳粹将领统率的德国武装部队的任何努力。另一方面，十分清楚，西德的重新军国主义化是符合于企图在欧洲准备新战争的德国复仇主义者和军国主义者的利益的。
    针对着建立新的欧洲国家军事集团的计划，苏联提出了它自己的保障欧洲各国人民集体安全的建议。
    苏联政府在柏林会议上提出了“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，这个草案的目的在于保障所有欧洲国家——不论它们的社会制度如何——的和平和安全。在这个问题上获致协议就会大大促进欧洲的和平，同时缓和国际紧张局势。
    苏联代表团在提出全欧条约草案的同时指出，对这个草案可以作各种修正，只要欧洲各国人民的集体安全的原则得到承认。迄今对这个草案的许多批评意见并未减少苏联建议的和平价值。
    例如，据说，美国不能加入欧洲集体安全条约是不适宜的。但是在柏林会议开会期间，并没有人说不能考虑对草案提出的相应的修正。
    还有人说，欧洲集体安全条约可能给苏联这样的国家造成令人不愉快的有利地位，因为它比其他欧洲国家更强大。然而，苏联并没有要求在欧洲国家集体安全体系中占有任何特殊的地位。
    当然，这些以及其他可能有的意见和修正应该予以适当的注意，并且可以在进一步讨论这个草案时加以考虑。
    苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案提供了走向保障安全的实际可行的道路，它和建立导向欧洲新战争的欧洲国家军事集团的企图是不相容的。这个草案是团结欧洲各国人民来巩固和平和国际安全的工具（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏联坚持不渝地为巩固世界和平而努力。但是我们知道，反对爱好和平的苏联的阴谋并没有停止。我们不应该忽视：反动势力正在公开地奉行准备新战争的政策。因此，为了缓和国际紧张局势，党和政府不得不注意尽力巩固苏维埃国家的力量，进一步坚持不懈地巩固并提高保卫苏联人民的和平劳动和我们国家的安全的苏联武装部队（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    今天，强大的民主和社会主义阵营和苏联一起保卫着和平。苏联和中国人民之间的伟大同盟和兄弟般的友谊加强了远东和全世界的和平力量（鼓掌）。
    苏联和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国及德意志民主共和国的兄弟般的友谊和合作，正在日益加强。和平、民主和社会主义阵营有着其他各国的千百万积极的和平战士的强大支持，并得到各国人民日益加强的支持。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举是对共产党和苏联政府的国内和对外政策的总考验。这次选举同时使苏联人民更加靠近共产党和政府。
    表现了我们党和广大劳动人民群众日益紧密的联系、并表现了我国人民在党周围的团结的党和非党联盟，正在日益壮大！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    共产党、苏联政府和英雄的苏联人民的伟大团结，正在日益巩固、日益壮大。（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量——共产党万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    共产主义的建设者——伟大的苏联人民万岁！
  （暴风雨般的、经久不息的欢呼声。全体起立）
