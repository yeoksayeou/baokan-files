    Soviet Union Holds Meeting of Activists in the Shipping Industry
    Malenkov, Khrushchev, and Others Attend

    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th] TASS, Moscow: The six-day Soviet meeting of activists in the maritime and inland river shipping industry concluded in Moscow on the 7th. The conference discussed water transport work in 1953 and the tasks for 1954. Participants included sea captains, water transport workers from the fourteen seas of the Soviet Union, sailors, mechanics, cargo ship captains from river transport areas including more than 100,000 rivers, workers from icebreakers and transport ships on the Northern Sea Route, scientific workers, shipbuilding workers, and representatives from other related departments.

    G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and L.M. Kaganovich, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, attended the meeting.

    V.V. Shashkov, Minister of Maritime and Inland River Shipping of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the meeting. He pointed out that the Communist Party and the government attach great importance to the development of water transport. We are carrying out unprecedented route transformation work. After the completion of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, the five seas in the European part of our country have been connected into a unified domestic waterway transportation system. The massive Molotov and Gorky hydraulic engineering complexes are nearing completion. The world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station, Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station, and Kakhovka, Novosibirsk, and other hydraulic engineering complexes will also be completed successively. These hydraulic engineering complexes will not only provide the country with a large amount of electricity, but also fundamentally change the face of water transport. At the same time, the Soviet fleet is undergoing further technical modifications. The inland river fleet, which suffered huge losses during the Great Patriotic War, now has almost one and a half times the transportation capacity as before the war. The Soviet water transport industry has also added technically more advanced ships, especially fast freighters. The carrying capacity of seagoing vessels has also increased. In 1953, the cargo transported by sea and inland rivers increased by one and a half times compared to 1940. However, all these achievements are far from meeting the needs of the national economy and have not fully exploited the potential of water transport itself. When talking about the water transport tasks for 1954, Shashkov pointed out that the primary task this year is to resolutely improve transportation services for agriculture and increase and accelerate the transportation of consumer goods. In developing foreign trade with the People's Democracies of Europe and the People's Republic of China, the role of Soviet seagoing vessels must be enhanced. In addition, preparations must be made for seagoing vessels to transport goods stipulated in the agreements concluded between the Soviet Union and many capitalist countries.

    The meeting then held discussions on this report. Attendees were divided into nine groups to discuss in detail the operation, repair, construction, and cadre work of the water transport industry.

    L.M. Kaganovich, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a lengthy speech at the closing meeting, which was warmly welcomed by the participants.

    苏联举行航运业活动分子会议
    马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫等出席会议
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联海上和内河航运业活动分子会议在莫斯科举行了六天，已于七日闭幕。会议讨论了一九五三年水运工作和一九五四年的任务。参加会议的有海船船长，苏联十四个领海的水运工作人员，包括十万多条河的河运区的水手、机械师、货船船长，北部海洋航线上的破冰船和运输船的工作人员，科学工作者，造船工人，以及其他有关部门的代表。
    苏联部长会议主席马林科夫、苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇参加了会议。
    苏联海上和内河航运部部长夏希科夫在会上作了报告。他指出，共产党和政府非常重视发展水运事业。我们正在进行历史上从未有过的航线改造工作。列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河建成后，我国欧洲部分的五个海已连成了一个国内水路交通的统一运输系统。规模巨大的莫洛托夫和高尔基两个水力综合工程枢纽即将建成。世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站、斯大林格勒水电站和卡霍夫卡、新西伯利亚等水力综合工程枢纽也将相继完工。这些水力综合工程枢纽不仅将使国家得到大量的电力，同时也将根本改变水运面貌。同时，苏联的船队正在实行进一步的技术改装。在卫国战争时期受到巨大损失的内河船队，现在的运输能力几乎增为战前的一倍半。苏联水运业还补充了技术上较完善的船只，特别是快速货船。海船的载运量也提高了。一九五三年，海上和内河运输的货物已增为一九四○年的一倍半。但是，这一切成绩还远远赶不上国民经济的要求，还没有发挥水运本身的潜力。夏希科夫在谈到一九五四年的水运任务时指出，今年的首要任务是坚决改进为农业服务的运输工作，增加和加速消费品的运输。在发展和欧洲各人民民主国家和中华人民共和国的对外贸易方面，必须提高苏联海船的作用。此外还要准备海船，运输苏联和许多资本主义国家缔结的协定中所规定的货物。
    会议接着就这个报告进行了讨论。到会者分成九个小组，分别详细地讨论了水运事业的经营、修理、建设、干部工作等问题。
    苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇在闭幕会议上发表了长篇演说，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
