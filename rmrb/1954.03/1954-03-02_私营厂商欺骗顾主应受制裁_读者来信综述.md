    Summary of Readers’ Letters
    Private Factories Cheating Customers Should Be Sanctioned

    This newspaper has received many letters from readers in the Northeast region exposing the fraudulent behavior of many private leather factories in Wanxian City, Sichuan Province, including Shulian, Jianguo, Guangrong, Jianhua, Heping, and Bayi. In August and September of last year, these private leather factories sent out promotional leaflets to many factories, mines, schools, and government offices in various parts of the Northeast, boasting that the leather shoes they manufactured were cheap and of high quality, and that delivery was prompt. As a result, many workers, revolutionary soldiers, government cadres, students, etc., were deceived into sending remittances to place orders. The large number of orders received by these leather factories exceeded their own production capacity, and some even misappropriated the order money, resulting in large numbers of orders being delayed, and the leather shoes produced were of inferior quality due to cutting corners. For example, Huo Yun from the Liaodong Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' General School wrote: "Our shoe money was remitted more than three months ago, and now that the severe winter has arrived, the leather shoes are still nowhere to be seen. As a result, some of the revolutionary disabled soldiers have suffered frostbite on their feet." Song Ziwu from Qingyuan, Northeast, wrote: "We ordered cotton leather shoes, but they have not been sent. The winters in the Northeast are particularly cold, and we exploration workers face wind and snow every day in the mountains. This fraudulent behavior of private merchants has affected our work." They unanimously demanded that the People's Government sanction these illegal merchants.

    After this newspaper reported these situations to the Wanxian City People's Government, the Wanxian City People's Government has taken the following actions regarding the fraudulent behavior of these leather factories: ordered each private factory to rush to produce a portion of the orders and return the order money for orders exceeding their own production capacity; formed a working group to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the raw materials and finished products of each private factory, and decided that in the future, the finished products of private factories will be purchased and supplied by the China Department Store Wanxian City Purchasing and Supply Station; arrested and prosecuted the capitalists of the Heping and Jianhua factories who committed serious illegal acts.

    Ordering goods by mail is a form of cross-regional sales, which not only disrupts the supply plans of state-owned commerce, causing unreasonable transportation and increasing circulation costs, but also allows some speculative merchants to take advantage of this to seek exorbitant profits. This is detrimental to both producers and consumers. Therefore, local people's governments should prohibit private merchants from handling mail order businesses and strengthen management of them.

    私营厂商欺骗顾主应受制裁
    ——读者来信综述
    本报收到很多东北地区的读者来信，揭发四川省万县市术联、建国、光荣、建华、和平、八一等不少私营制革厂的欺骗顾主行为。去年八、九月间，这些私营制革厂向东北各地很多厂矿、学校、机关散发承揽订货的宣传单，夸说他们制造的皮鞋价廉物美，而且交货迅速。因此，不少工人、革命军人、机关干部、学生等就被骗汇款订购。这些制革厂收到的大批订货超过了本身的生产能力，有的还把订款挪用了，因而大批订货拖延不能交付，制出的皮鞋也因偷工减料而质量低劣。如辽东省革命残废军人总校霍云来信说：“我们的鞋款汇去了三个多月，现在时届严冬，结果还是不见皮鞋寄来。有一部分革命残废军人因而冻伤了脚。”东北清原宋子武来信说：“我们订购了棉皮鞋，可是一直没有寄来。东北的冬天特别寒冷，我们勘探工作者每天都在山野里面临着风雪工作。私商的这种欺骗行为已经影响了我们的工作。”他们一致要求人民政府制裁这些不法奸商。
    经本报把这些情况反映给万县市人民政府，万县市人民政府已经对这些制革厂的欺骗行为作了如下处理：责令各户私营厂赶制一部分订货，并将超过本身生产能力的订货款退回；组成工作组对各私营厂的原料、成品进行全面检查，并决定今后私营厂的成品由中国百货公司万县市采购供应站统购；对严重违法的和平、建华两厂的资本家逮捕法办。
    函购业务是一种越区推销的性质，不仅会打乱国营商业的供应计划，造成不合理的运输，增加流转费用；而且会使有些投机奸商乘此牟取暴利。这对生产者和消费者都是不利的。因此，各地人民政府应该制止私商办理函购业务，对他们加强管理。
