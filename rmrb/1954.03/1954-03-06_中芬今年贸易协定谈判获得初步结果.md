    The 1953 trade agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Finland expired on February 28th. The implementation of the trade agreement was very satisfactory. Representatives of the Chinese and Finnish governments have conducted negotiations in Beijing regarding the 1954 Sino-Finnish trade agreement and have achieved preliminary results. It is expected that the total value of commodities exchanged between China and Finland in 1954 will increase by approximately 19% compared to 1953. The commodities exchanged and the methods of exchange are fully in line with the economic interests of both countries. The Chinese government has also agreed to pay a portion of the value of certain Finnish export commodities in foreign exchange.

    Currently, the representatives of both parties have reported these preliminary results to their respective governments. After approval, they are prepared to sign the agreement in Helsinki. Regarding the technical issues related to the 1954 Sino-Finnish trade agreement, both parties are still continuing discussions.

    中芬今年贸易协定谈判获得初步结果
    【新华社五日讯】中华人民共和国和芬兰共和国间所签订的一九五三年贸易协定已于二月二十八日期满，贸易协定执行的情况是很完满的。中芬两国政府代表已在北京进行了关于一九五四年中芬贸易协定谈判，并已获得了初步结果。预计一九五四年中芬两国间的互换商品的总金额将较一九五三年增长百分之十九左右；交换的商品和进行交换的方式是完全符合两国的经济利益的；中国政府并同意对芬方若干出口商品的部分货值以外汇支付。
    现在，双方代表业已将这一初步结果各自报告本国政府。俟批准后，准备在赫尔辛基签字。至于有关一九五四年中芬贸易协定的技术性问题，双方仍在继续进行商谈中。
