Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, Paris: The French National Assembly held a debate on the Indochina issue on the 5th. Although the deputies of various parties who spoke at the meeting viewed the Indochina issue from different perspectives, they all agreed to end the war through negotiations rather than through military force, which had no hope of victory. Many deputies particularly fiercely criticized the French government's policy of relying on the United States to continue the Indochina War.

Daniel Mayer, leader of the Socialist Party and chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, who requested the debate, questioned in his speech: At the Geneva Conference, would France "quarrel with Communist China alongside the United States, or adopt an independent attitude without relying on the United States?" He said that if the United States not only wanted to provide money, but also offer opinions, it was necessary to explain to them that there must be a certain limit. De Chambeiran, a member of the Republican Union for Progress, also suspected that American "aid" was attached with "political conditions." He said that finding a solution to the Indochina issue was primarily a matter for France and the Vietnamese people. He also asked the Ranier government to honor its promise to seize any peace proposals.

Arthur Giovoni, a member of the French Communist Party, pointed out in his speech that the Indochina War had placed France in a "position completely at the mercy of the United States."

Under the accusations of the deputies, Ranier had to admit in his speech that the National Assembly was now unanimously in favor of ending the war through negotiations. He even stated: "France will welcome a solution to this war through diplomatic means." However, he immediately declared: "Obviously, during the upcoming talks, our military efforts will not be relaxed." He also put forward so-called "ceasefire conditions": the people's armed forces of Laos and Cambodia must "withdraw"; at the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army must "withdraw" or "disarm" from the Red River Delta and South Vietnam, and the Vietnamese People's Army in the Sino-Vietnamese region must be "concentrated" in "strictly defined areas." Even Ranier himself believed that these conditions would not be accepted, which only exposed Ranier's intention to use the so-called "ceasefire conditions" to pre-emptively place a roadblock on the road to a peaceful resolution, so that France could continue to rely on the United States to wage war.

Ranier's speech aroused dissatisfaction in the parliament. Former Radical Socialist Prime Minister Daladier expressed disappointment with Ranier's speech. He said that it was unreasonable to demand that the Vietnamese People's Army withdraw from most of the Red River Delta that they had liberated as a condition for a ceasefire. He also pointed out that the Bao Dai "government" was not trusted by the Vietnamese people. He also questioned whether France would be bound by the agreement signed with the United States in June 1953, which stipulated that France, which accepted American "aid," could not hold peace talks without the consent of the United States.

French Socialists commented on Ranier's speech, saying, "These conditions are less a truce proposal than 'surrender conditions.'"

The French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" said: Ranier's "conditions" "seem to have extinguished a glimmer of hope for achieving peace in Indochina." French public opinion has increasingly realized that various methods of strengthening the Indochina War, including increased "aid" from the United States, cannot enable France to achieve military victory. The "Volunteer Army News" admitted on the 5th that no matter what reports French politicians bring back from Indochina, two conclusions are undeniable: (1) Even if the United States increases "aid," a military solution is unimaginable. (2) The genuine replacement of the French Expeditionary Force by the Indochinese puppet army will remain a "slim hope" for a long time.

    法国民议会就印度支那问题进行辩论
    法国各党派议员都主张通过谈判结束战争
    拉尼埃提出的所谓“停火条件”引起议会和舆论的不满
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会五日就印度支那问题进行辩论。在会上发言的各党派议员，尽管他们从不同的角度来看印度支那问题，但是，他们全部赞成用谈判而不是用没有胜利希望的武力的方式来结束战争，许多议员特别激烈地抨击法国政府依附美国继续印度支那战争的政策。
    要求举行这次辩论的社会党领袖、国民议会外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶在发言时提出质问说：在日内瓦会议上，法国“究竟是和美国在一起与共产党中国争吵呢？还是采取不依附美国的独立态度呢？”他说：如果美国不仅要给钱，而且也要提供意见，那么就有必要向他们说明必须有一定限度。进步共和联盟议员德香布兰也怀疑美国的“援助”是附有“政治条件”的。他说：找出一种解决印度支那问题的办法首先是法国和越南人民的问题。他并要求拉尼埃政府信守它所许下的要抓紧任何和平建议的诺言。
    法国共产党议员阿图尔·希奥沃尼在发言中指出，印度支那战争已使法国处于“完全听凭美国摆布的地位”。
    在议员的纷纷责难下，拉尼埃在发言时不得不承认：国民议会现在是一致赞成以谈判来结束战争。他甚至也表示：“法国将欢迎通过外交方式来解决这个战争”。但是，他随即声明：“很明显的，在即将到来的会谈期间，我们的军事努力将不会放松。”他并提出了所谓“停火条件”：寮国和高棉的人民武装必须“撤退”；同时，越南人民军必须从红河三角洲和南越“撤退”或“解除武装”，在中越的越南人民军必须“集中”在“严格划定的地区”。关于这些条件，连拉尼埃自己也相信不会被接受，这只是暴露了拉尼埃利用所谓“停火条件”预先在和平解决的道路上安置一个路障，以便于法国继续依附美国进行战争的意图。
    拉尼埃的发言在议会中引起了不满。前激进社会党总理达拉第对拉尼埃的演说表示失望。他说：要求越南人民军撤出大部分为他们所解放的红河三角洲来作为一个停火的条件，这是不合理的。他并指出，保大“政府”并不为越南人民所信任。他还质询法国是否将受一九五三年六月和美国签订的协定的约束，这个协定规定接受美国“援助”的法国不得在未取得美国的同意的情况下举行和平谈判。
    法国社会党人在评论拉尼埃的发言时说，“这些条件与其说是停战建议，不如说是‘投降条件’”。
    法国资产阶级报纸“战斗报”说：拉尼埃的“条件”“似乎已经扑灭了在印度支那获致和平的一线希望”。法国舆论已经越来越认识到：包括美国增加“援助”在内的各种加强印度支那战争的办法，都不可能使法国取得军事上的胜利。“义勇军报”五日承认：不管法国政治家从印度支那带来什么报告，但是有两个结论是不容置辩的：（一）即使美国增加“援助”，军事的解决也是不可想像的。（二）由印度支那伪军真正来代替法国远征军，在很长的时间中仍将是一个“渺茫的希望”。
