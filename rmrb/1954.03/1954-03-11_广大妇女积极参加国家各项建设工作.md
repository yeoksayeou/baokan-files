The Growing Number of Female Industrial Technicians Among Ethnic Minorities in Xinjiang Province

The number of female industrial technicians among ethnic minorities in Xinjiang Province is growing. In 1952, Xinjiang began establishing some modern industrial and mining enterprises, and young women from various ethnic minorities successively walked out of the countryside and their homes and into major factories. Now, there are hundreds of young female technicians from the Uyghur, Kazakh, Hui, Xibe, Uzbek, Tajik, and other ethnic groups in the province, including more than 70 who have gone to Suzhou to learn modern silk reeling techniques.

The factories attach great importance to the training of young female workers from ethnic minorities. The October Automobile Repair Factory uses the method of Han veteran workers mentoring apprentices, and has trained 20 female ethnic minority lathe workers in just over a year. In order to enable them to understand mechanical principles and continue to improve their operating skills, this factory has begun offering them two- to four-year cultural and technical education this year. In January of this year, the July 1st Cotton Textile Factory selected a group of Han female workers with the best skills to specifically help 55 young female workers from various ethnic minorities who had just entered the factory to learn textile technology. In less than two months, 23 of them were basically able to operate the machines. Under the planned training of the factories, young female workers from ethnic minorities are making rapid progress. Kuwan Xilifu, a young Uyghur female electroplating worker at the October Automobile Repair Factory, completely mastered the electroplating technology in less than a year with the help of Han veteran workers, and was elected as a first-class labor model by the factory's employees in 1953. Ayisham, a young Uyghur female worker who only entered the cotton textile factory in January of this year, now produces Tianshan brand cotton cloth with a quality rate of over 92% every day.

Vast Numbers of Rural Women in Hebei Province Actively Participate in Agricultural Production Cooperatives

Vast numbers of rural women in Hebei Province are actively participating in agricultural production cooperatives. According to statistics from 37 relatively large agricultural production cooperatives with more than 30 households in 14 counties, including Mancheng and Yi counties in Baoding Prefecture alone, 2,393 women are participating in the cooperatives, accounting for 49.4% of the total number of members. Among them, 431 women cadres serve as group leaders or higher. Throughout the province, outstanding figures such as Jin Xuexian from Daming County and Zhao Heini from Xingtai County, female heads of agricultural production cooperatives, have also emerged.

Women in agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province have already demonstrated their role in agricultural labor last year. For example, in the Zhou Luokang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuaicun, Ding County, the work points earned by female members in harvesting millet, picking cotton, scraping yam slices, threshing, and pinching millet in the autumn accounted for 36.76% of the cooperative's total work points. Around the autumnal equinox last year, the cooperative had to plant 85 mu of wheat and pick 97 mu of cotton, but at that time, there were only 10 male laborers in the cooperative, and they could not finish the work. Later, 13 female full-time laborers were mobilized to participate in wheat planting, and women with children picked cotton, completely solving the problem of insufficient labor. The large-scale participation of women in agricultural production provides more favorable conditions for intensive farming in agricultural production cooperatives. In the Zhang Luoqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dajia Village, Mancheng County, millet was thinned by hand, corn was artificially pollinated, and cotton was pinched and pruned by hand last year, increasing labor by about one time, which was mainly done by women. The cooperative adopted new techniques last year, and the yield of millet per mu reached 800 to 1,000 jin. In agricultural production cooperatives in various places, many women participated in sideline production due to the rational division of labor. In the Zhang Yushu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanshijiang Village, Zhuozhou County, 15 women, in addition to directly participating in agricultural production, also designated six people to make tofu and grind sesame oil. The tofu dregs were used to raise five large sows, which gave birth to 40 piglets, earning a profit of more than 2.7 million yuan, and the two old and weak donkeys were replaced with two good ones. In addition, the oil mill accumulated 6,400 jin of fertilizer, earning a net profit of 2.5 million yuan, which greatly supported the cooperative's agricultural production increase that year.

After the Communist Party of China's Hebei Provincial Committees and women's federations at all levels strengthened leadership and education, and with the actual role of women in production, the idea of ​​men underestimating women's labor gradually changed among many male farmers. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various places have begun to pay attention to "equal pay for equal work" for men and women. The gradual implementation of this method will greatly stimulate women's enthusiasm for participating in agricultural production cooperatives and greatly improve women's family and social status.

Chairman of the People's Government of Rehe Province Commends Female Elementary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production

On the eve of "March 8th" International Women's Day, Shen Yue, Chairman of the People's Government of Rehe Province, and Yang Yumin, Vice Chairman, met with Li Enfeng, a female labor model and graduate of elementary school who attended the province's Mutual Aid and Cooperation Bumper Harvest Model Conference. During the meeting, Chairman Shen Yue and Vice Chairman Yang Yumin commended Li Enfeng's new ideas and qualities for participating in agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation after graduating from elementary school. They also inquired in detail about her participation in agricultural production and congratulated her on being elected as a labor model to attend this provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Bumper Harvest Model Conference. The Rehe Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League also issued instructions calling on League members and young people throughout the province to learn from Li Enfeng's example of participating in agricultural production.

Li Enfeng is a female member of the Communist Youth League in Sanfendi Village, Aohan Banner, Rehe Province, and is 19 years old this year. She was educated in school and visited a nearby agricultural machinery exhibition, recognizing the prospects of socialist agricultural production, and began to change her past mistaken idea that "agricultural production is unpromising." After graduating from elementary school last year, she participated in agricultural production. Later, with the help of the League branch, she gradually strengthened her confidence in participating in production. During this period, the Sanfendi Village branch of the Communist Party of China also helped her overcome family obstacles. Soon, she joined the Song Zhenbang mutual aid team in the village, actively learning and mastering production technology, and mobilizing women in the team to participate in production. Under her leadership, some women became production experts. During the autumn harvest, the daily labor points of five women were only one point lower than those of men. Li Enfeng's deeds were praised by everyone in the village, so she was unanimously elected by the masses as a labor model for the village and banner.

Southwest Minority Women Participate in Government Work

Southwest minority women actively participate in government work and national construction. In recent years, the Communist Party committees and people's governments at all levels in the Southwest region have paid great attention to training women cadres while vigorously training minority cadres. There are a certain number of women in the people's government committees and people's representatives in various ethnic minority areas, and some women have also served as county heads, district heads, and township heads. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the 19 counties have 20 female government committee members and 255 female people's representatives. Xiang Biying, the deputy county head of Bijie County, Guizhou Province, is a Miao farmer woman. In the first phase of basic-level elections in 23 townships in the Miao Autonomous Region of Lushan County, Guizhou Province, 102 women were elected as people's representatives, township people's government committee members, or township heads. They are all working women who have gradually grown up under the cultivation of the Communist Party in recent years, and many of them have joined the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. People's governments at all levels pay great attention to recruiting minority women to study in various ethnic minority cadre training classes or ethnic schools to help them improve their political and cultural levels.

A considerable number of women from various ethnic minorities have begun to participate in national construction work. On the Kangzang Plateau, many Tibetan women drive yaks to support the construction of the Kangzang Highway, and 21 women support models have emerged in Kangding. Many women in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province have also participated in the construction of the Cheng'a Highway. In Lhasa, many women have also participated in the city's construction work. In the areas of Guizhou and Yunnan where land reform has been carried out, women of all ethnic groups have actively participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and many women have become excellent mutual aid team leaders and labor models. The people's governments in various places have taken many measures to improve women's labor skills. Agricultural technology guidance stations or training classes in Daofu, Ganzi, Danba and other counties in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province have trained 74 Tibetan women who can use new-style plows and master other agricultural technologies. The Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province has specially opened a textile training class for Qiang women, enabling Qiang women to learn more advanced textile techniques. In addition, the health departments of people's governments in various places have also trained many female health workers and midwives. Guizhou Province alone has more than 790 female new-method midwives, including Zhang Boying, a first-class midwifery model from the Miao ethnic group. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    广大妇女积极参加国家各项建设工作
    新疆省各少数民族的女产业技术工人正在成长
    新疆省各少数民族的女产业技术工人正在成长。一九五二年新疆开始建立一些现代化的工矿企业，各少数民族的青年妇女就相继从农村、从家庭走进了各大工厂。现在，全省已有数百名维吾尔、哈萨克、回、锡伯、乌兹别克、塔吉克等族青年女技术工人，其中到苏州学习现代化缫丝技术的就有七十多人。
    各工厂十分重视对少数民族青年女工的培养。十月汽车修配厂采用汉族老工人带徒弟的办法，一年多培养了二十名少数民族女车床工人。为了使她们懂得机械原理，继续提高操作技术，今年这个工厂又开始向她们进行两年到四年期限的文化技术教育。七一棉纺织厂今年一月挑选了一批技术最好的汉族女工，专门帮助刚进厂的五十五名各少数民族青年女工学习纺织技术，不到两个月就有二十三人基本上可以操纵机器了。在各工厂有计划地培养下，少数民族青年女工进步很快。十月汽车修配厂维吾尔族青年女电镀车工库完希里甫，在汉族老工人帮助下，不到一年就完全熟练地掌握了电镀技术，一九五三年被全厂职工选为一等劳动模范。今年一月才进入棉纺织厂的维吾尔族青年女工阿衣夏木，现在每天织出来的天山牌市布，质量已达到百分之九十二以上。
  河北省广大农村妇女积极参加农业生产合作社
    河北省广大农村妇女积极参加农业生产合作社。仅据保定专区的满城、易县等十四个县三十七个三十户以上的较大农业生产合作社统计，参加社的妇女就有二千三百九十三人，占社员总数的百分之四十九点四。其中担任小组长以上的妇女干部达四百三十一人。在全省范围内，还出现了如大名县的晋学贤、邢台县的赵黑妮等农业生产合作社女社长的优秀人物。
    河北省各地农业生产合作社中的妇女在去年一年农业劳动中，已显示出她们的作用。例如定县帅村周洛康农业生产合作社的女社员在秋季参加割谷子、摘棉花、擦山药片、打场、掐谷子等庄稼活所得的工分，占全社总工分的百分之三十六点七六。该社在去年秋分前后，要种八十五亩小麦，又要摘九十七亩棉花，但当时社里只有男劳力十人，活做不过来。后来发动了十三个妇女整劳力参加种麦，有孩子的妇女摘棉花，劳力不足的困难全解决了。大量的妇女参加农业生产，给农业生产合作社的精耕细作以更加有利的条件。满城县大贾村张洛乔农业生产合作社去年谷子用手提间苗，玉米用人工授粉，棉花用手掐尖、掰杈，用工约增加一倍，这些都主要由妇女去做。该社去年因为采用了新的技术，每亩谷子产量达八百斤到一千斤。在各地农业生产合作社里，由于做到合理地分工分业，许多妇女参加了副业生产。涿县南石家务村张玉书农业生产合作社十五个妇女除直接参加农业生产外，还抽出六人作豆腐和磨香油。豆腐渣养了五口大母猪，生了四十个小猪，获利二百七十多万元，把两个老弱的驴换成了两个好的驴。并且油坊积酱肥六千四百斤，赚纯利二百五十万元，给当年该社的农业增产以很大的支持。
    经过中共河北省各级党委和妇联组织加强领导和教育，以及妇女们在生产中的实际作用，许多男农民轻视妇女劳动的思想逐步得到扭转。各地农业生产合作社和互助组，开始注意了男女劳力的“同工同酬”。这种办法的逐渐实行，将更大地激发起妇女参加农业生产合作社的热情，大大提高妇女的家庭地位和社会地位。
  热河省人民政府主席表扬参加农业生产的高小女毕业生
    在“三八”节前夕，热河省人民政府主席沈越、副主席杨雨民接见了出席该省互助合作丰产模范会议的高小毕业生——妇女劳动模范李恩凤。在接见中，沈越主席和杨雨民副主席对李恩凤从高小毕业后参加农业生产和互助合作的新思想新品质加以表扬。并详细询问了她参加农业生产的情况，祝贺她当选劳动模范出席这次全省互助合作丰产模范会议。中国新民主主义青年团热河省委员会也发出指示，号召全省团员和青年学习李恩凤参加农业生产的榜样。
    李恩凤是热河省敖汉旗三分地村的女青年团员，今年十九岁。她在学校里受到教育，又参观了附近的一次农业机器展览会，认识了社会主义农业生产的远景，开始扭转了过去认为“农业生产没出息”的错误思想。去年她在高小毕业后，便参加了农业生产。以后在团支部的帮助下，又逐渐坚定了参加生产的信心。在这期间，中共三分地村支部又帮助她克服了家庭的阻碍。不久，她便参加了村内宋振帮互助组，积极学习掌握生产技术，并动员组内妇女参加生产。有些妇女在她带动下，成了生产的能手。在秋收中，有五名妇女每日的劳动分数仅较男人低一分。李恩凤的事迹，在村中受到人人称赞，因此被群众一致推选为村、旗的劳动模范。
  西南少数民族妇女参加政权工作
    西南各少数民族妇女积极参加政权工作及祖国各项建设。几年来，西南地区中共各级党委和各级人民政府在大力培养少数民族干部中，很注意培养妇女干部。各民族地区人民政府委员和人民代表中，都有一定的妇女名额，有些妇女并担任了县长、区长和乡长等职务。西康省藏族自治区十九个县就有二十名女政府委员、二百五十五个女人民代表，贵州省毕节县的副县长是苗族农民妇女项毕英，贵州炉山县苗族自治区第一期二十三个乡的基层选举中，有一百零二名妇女被选为人民代表、乡人民政府委员或乡长。她们都是几年来在共产党的培养下逐渐成长起来的劳动妇女，其中有不少人已加入中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团。各级人民政府很注意吸收少数民族妇女在各种民族干部训练班或民族学校学习，帮助她们提高政治、文化水平。
  各少数民族已开始有不少妇女参加了国家各项建设工作。在康藏高原上，许多藏族妇女赶着牦牛支援康藏公路的建设，康定就出现了二十一名妇女支援模范。四川藏族自治区也有不少妇女参加成阿公路的建设。在拉萨还有很多妇女参加了市内的兴建工作。贵州和云南已进行土地改革的地区，各族妇女积极参加了互助合作组织，有许多妇女已成为出色的互助组组长和劳动模范。各地人民政府曾经采取了许多措施来提高妇女的劳动技术。西康省藏族自治区道孚、甘孜、丹巴等县的农业技术指导站或训练班，已培养出七十四名能使用新式步犁和掌握其他农业技术的藏族妇女。四川藏族自治区专门为羌族妇女开办了一所纺织训练班，使羌族妇女们学到了较进步的纺织技术。此外，各地人民政府的卫生部门还培养了许多妇女卫生员和接生员，仅贵州省就有七百九十多名女新法接生员，其中有一等接生模范苗族妇女张伯英。（据新华社讯）
