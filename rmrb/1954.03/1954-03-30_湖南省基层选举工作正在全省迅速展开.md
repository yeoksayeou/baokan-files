    Hunan Province's basic-level election work is rapidly unfolding throughout the province. As of March 20th, among the province's more than 15,000 basic-level units, more than 4,800 have completed basic-level elections, and more than 10,500 are in the process of nominating representative candidates. In many townships and towns that have completed basic-level elections, the voter turnout has reached over 90%. The vast number of voters regard the voting day as a solemn festival. Yang Mingxun, a voter from Hengyang County, specially brought his wife back from another place the day before the vote. Farmer Yang Chengjia's mother is blind, but on the day of the election, she asked Yang Chengjia to help her attend the election meeting. After the launch of the general election movement in various places, the vast number of voters put forward the slogan "Do a good job in production and welcome the general election." During the general election process, farmers in Caotang Township, Hengyang County, plowed nearly 100 mu of paddy fields, repaired 24 ponds, and accumulated nearly 1,000 dan of fertilizer. Xianfeng Township in Changsha County was originally a township with a weak work foundation. After the general election movement, the township's work on repairing ponds and dams, accumulating fertilizer, and purchasing national economic construction bonds was completed quickly. During the general election work in Shanyin Township, Xiangtan County, the original 34 mutual aid groups were rectified and consolidated. In this township, the Han Jinshan mutual aid group, which had failed to be established after more than 50 meetings, was established during this general election movement. The elected representatives regarded the voters' trust in them as a great honor, and expressed that they would better connect with the masses and do their work well in the future. Gong Lin, a people's representative from Shimen Township, Hengshan County, launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign with the mutual aid group the day after the township people's congress was held. Li Fengyun, a family member of a volunteer soldier from Taojiang Township, Lingling County, was elected as a people's representative. Holding the certificate of election, she said: "I will write to my husband in Korea and promise to do a good job in production and work together to strive for greater glory." (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南省基层选举工作正在全省迅速展开
    湖南省基层选举工作正在全省迅速展开。到三月二十日止，全省一万五千多个基层单位中，完成基层选举的有四千八百多个基层单位，正在进行代表候选人提名的有一万零五百多个基层单位。许多已经完成基层选举的乡、镇，参加投票的选民都达到百分之九十以上。广大选民把投票日当作一个庄严的节日。衡阳县选民杨名勋，在投票的前一天，特地把妻子从外地接了回来。农民杨成嘉的母亲已双目失明，进行选举的那天，她要杨成嘉搀着去参加了选举大会。各地普选运动展开后，广大选民都提出了“搞好生产，迎接普选”的口号。衡阳县草塘乡农民在普选过程中，犁了近百亩稻田，修好了二十四口塘，积肥近千担。长沙县先锋乡原为工作基础较差的乡，普选运动以后，该乡的修塘坝、积肥、认购国家经济建设公债等项工作都很快地完成了。湘潭县杉荫乡在进行普选工作中，整顿和巩固了原有三十四个互助组。这一个乡有一个曾经开了五十多次会都没建立起来的韩金山互助组，在这次普选运动中建立起来了。当选的代表们把选民对自己的信任引为莫大的荣誉，表示今后要更好地联系群众，做好工作。衡山县石门乡人民代表龚林，在开了乡人民代表大会的第二天，便领导互助组展开了积肥运动。零陵县桃江乡志愿军家属李凤云当选为人民代表后，拿着当选证书说：“我要写信告诉在朝鲜的丈夫，保证把生产和工作搞好，共同争取更大的光荣。”　（新华社）
