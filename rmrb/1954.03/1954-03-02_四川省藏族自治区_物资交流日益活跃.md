Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region
Material Exchange Increasingly Active

The material exchange in the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region is becoming increasingly active. This is a new scene brought about by the opening of the Cheng-A Highway from Chengdu to the autonomous region. At present, many material distribution centers have formed along the highway. Large quantities of local products and special products are being shipped out continuously, and the fabrics, tea, salt, and rice needed by the people of all ethnic groups are also being supplied in large quantities. For example, after the highway opened to Xuecheng Town in Li County in March of last year, the area's imports in one month were four times that of the month before the opening of the highway, and its exports in one quarter were eleven times more than the quarter before the opening. At the same time, the prices of various daily necessities have also generally decreased. In Li County, local cloth has dropped from 80,000 or 90,000 yuan per bolt to over 60,000 yuan, and tea has dropped from 300,000 yuan per dan to around 160,000 yuan. State-owned trading companies have also reasonably increased the purchase prices of local products, which has generally increased the purchasing power of the people of all ethnic groups and improved their lives. Last year, more and more people in the mountainous areas added new clothes and quilts. In Daqi Mountain Village near Xuecheng Town alone, 57 households added more than 100 quilts last year.

With the booming material exchange and the increase in people's purchasing power, the towns along the highway are gradually becoming prosperous. The number of industrial and commercial households in Li County has increased by 80% compared to before the highway opened. The turnover of both public and private shops has risen rapidly. The turnover of the state-owned trading company in Xuecheng Town last year was two and a half times more than the previous year. Many new market towns and villages have also appeared along the highway. For example, Shuajin Temple used to be a barren dam, but now more than 500 new houses have been built. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川省藏族自治区
    物资交流日益活跃
    四川省藏族自治区物资交流日益活跃，这是成阿公路从成都通车到自治区后带来的新景象。目前公路沿线已形成许多物资集散点，大宗土产和特产品源源外运，各族人民需要的布匹、茶叶、食盐、大米也大量得到供应。如去年三月公路通车到理县薛城镇后，该区一个月内进口的物资，就相当于通车前一个月的四倍，一个季度出口的物资，比通车前一个季度多十一倍。同时各种日用品的价格也普遍降低了。在理县，土布每匹由八、九万元降到六万多元，茶叶每担由三十万元降到十六万元左右。国营贸易公司还合理提高了土产品的收购价格，使各族人民的购买力普遍提高，生活得到改善。去年山区里添制新衣、新被子的人越来越多。仅薛城镇附近大岐山寨的五十七户人家，去年就添制了一百多床被子。
    随着物资交流的旺畅和人民购买力的提高，公路沿线的城镇逐渐繁荣起来。理县全县的工商户，比通车前增加了百分之八十。公私商店的营业额都迅速上升。薛城镇国营贸易公司去年的营业额就比前年增加了两倍半。公路沿线还出现了不少新的集镇和村落，如刷金寺过去是一个荒坝，现在已修起五百多间新房子。（新华社）
