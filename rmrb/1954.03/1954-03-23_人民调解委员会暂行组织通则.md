  (Adopted at the 206th Political Affairs Council Meeting of the Government Administration Council on February 25, 1954)
Article 1: These Regulations are formulated to establish People's Mediation Committees (hereinafter referred to as Mediation Committees) to promptly resolve civil disputes among the people, strengthen patriotic and law-abiding education among the people, and enhance internal unity among the people, in order to benefit people's production and national construction.
Article 2: The Mediation Committee is a mass mediation organization that works under the guidance of the basic-level People's Government and the basic-level People's Court.
Article 3: The tasks of the Mediation Committee are to mediate general civil disputes and minor criminal cases among the people, and to conduct propaganda and education on policies and laws through mediation.
Article 4: The establishment of Mediation Committees shall generally be based on the jurisdiction of the police station or street in urban areas, and on the township in rural areas. The Mediation Committee shall be composed of three to eleven members.
Article 5: Members of the Mediation Committee shall generally be elected by representatives of residents in urban areas under the auspices of the basic-level People's Government; in rural areas, they shall be elected by the township People's Congress. The Mediation Committee shall have one chairman and may have one to two vice-chairmen, who shall be elected by the members of the Mediation Committee. Elections shall be held annually, and members may be re-elected. Anyone among the people who has a clear political background, is fair-minded, maintains contact with the masses, and is enthusiastic about mediation work may be elected as a member of the Mediation Committee. If a member of the Mediation Committee violates the law, neglects his duties, or is incompetent during his term of office, he may be removed and re-elected by the original election organization at any time.

          1. Mediation must be conducted in accordance with the policies and laws of the People's Government;
          2. The consent of both parties must be obtained, and mediation shall not be forced;
          3. It must be understood that mediation is not a necessary procedure for filing a lawsuit, and the parties shall not be prevented from filing a lawsuit with the People's Court because they have not undergone mediation or mediation has failed.
Article 7: The disciplines that the Mediation Committee must observe:
          1. It is forbidden to be corrupt or accept bribes or engage in malpractice for personal gain;
          2. It is forbidden to impose penalties or detain the parties;
          3. It is forbidden to engage in any suppression or retaliation against the parties.
Article 8: When mediating cases, the Mediation Committee should use spare time from production to carry out its work, listen to the opinions of the parties, conduct in-depth investigation and research, clarify the facts of the case, and conduct mediation with an amiable and patient attitude and in a manner of reasoning. After a settlement is reached in the mediation of a case, it may be registered, and a mediation statement may be issued to the parties if necessary.
Article 9: If the Mediation Committee mediates a case in violation of policies or laws, the People's Court shall correct or revoke it.
Article 10: Basic-level People's Governments and basic-level People's Courts shall strengthen guidance and supervision over the Mediation Committee and assist it in its work.
Article 11: These Regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government.
