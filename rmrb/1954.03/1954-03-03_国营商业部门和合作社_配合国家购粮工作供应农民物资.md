State-Owned Commercial Departments and Cooperatives
    Coordinate with National Grain Purchase Work to Supply Farmers with Materials
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives, in coordination with the state's planned purchase of grain, actively supply rural areas with daily-use industrial products and means of production.
    Due to the development of national industry, the prices of certain industrial products, such as sugar, salt, cloth, and matches, have been reduced in this round of supplies to farmers organized by state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives. The price of cloth has been lowered by 3.5 percent. Statistics from just four commodities—cloth, towels, socks, and undershirts and pants—show that over the past year, a total of 563.1 billion yuan has been saved for urban and rural people, the vast majority of which was sold to rural areas. In terms of means of production, the price of fertilizer powder in 1953 was 200 yuan per jin lower than in 1951. Last year, cooperatives supplied nearly 500,000 tons of fertilizer powder, saving farmers nearly 200 billion yuan in this item alone.
    During the period when farmers enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state, the quantity and variety of materials supplied to rural areas by state-owned commercial organizations were unprecedented in history. For example, comparing the period from November of last year to January of this year with the period from November of the year before last to January of last year, the sales volume of the most common commodities sold in rural areas increased as follows: kerosene increased by 96.28 percent, matches increased by 71.67 percent, socks increased by 95.8 percent, and towels increased by 64.18 percent. Several large cities with more concentrated industries, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Chongqing, began shipping various goods to small and medium-sized cities and the vast rural areas, especially grain-producing areas, starting in August of last year. The quantity of general merchandise allocated to rural areas in the Northeast, North China, and Central and Southern China in the fourth quarter of last year increased by more than 30 percent compared to the same period of the year before last. The percentage of state-owned commercial departments' sales to cooperatives in the total sales of each department increased from 10 to 20 percent before the planned purchase to 30 to 40 percent after the planned purchase of grain.
    In order to make the materials as suitable as possible to the needs of the rural market, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in major regions and large cities across the country also sent personnel deep into grain-producing areas to investigate farmers' needs for daily necessities and means of production after selling surplus grain. They used various methods to organize the supply of materials suitable for rural needs to the countryside. Large white towels for farmers to wrap their heads, multi-strand thick yarn socks, buttoned flannel shirts, small scented soaps, and inexpensive cigarettes, which were transported to the countryside in large quantities, were extremely popular in rural areas. The cold-proof supplies transported to rural areas by state-owned commercial departments in Northeast China were well-received by farmers because they appropriately took into account the characteristics of farmers in various regions.
    While supplying living materials, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country attached great importance to the supply of means of production, especially means of production for spring plowing. In the three months of planned purchase, according to incomplete statistics, the total value of means of production supplied to rural areas by the national cooperative system exceeded more than three times that of the same period last year. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen counties in eight provinces, including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Suiyuan, Ningxia, and Xinjiang, cooperatives organized and supplied a total of more than 29,600 head of livestock to farmers in the fourth quarter of last year, using materials exchange meetings and acting as purchasing agents for farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Rehe, and Heilongjiang provinces also vigorously sold or bought livestock. The supply of other various agricultural implements also greatly exceeded that of previous years. In the situation where national basic construction needed a large amount of timber, the state also allocated 150,000 cubic meters of timber to supply and marketing cooperatives in various places at the end of last year to meet the needs of rural areas for manufacturing agricultural implements and building houses in the spring. In addition to the state's supply of steel for manufacturing agricultural implements, cooperatives across the country began to purchase a large amount of scrap steel last winter, planning to solve the raw material problem for rural handicrafts with 91,000 tons of iron this spring.
    In order to appropriately meet the needs of farmers to expand production in spring plowing, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country are now taking the organization of means of production to supply rural areas and support spring plowing as an urgent task. The cooperative system in North China has expanded the operation of means of production, adding means of production sales departments, stalls, and processing plants. Supply and marketing cooperatives in East China have held materials exchange meetings in some places, and in others, they have convened production and sales meetings with local handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft representatives to study ways to expand the supply of means of production.

    国营商业部门和合作社
    配合国家购粮工作供应农民物资
    国营商业和合作社配合国家计划收购粮食，积极以日用工业品、生产资料供应农村。
    这次国营商业和合作社组织供应农民的物资，由于国家工业的发展，有若干工业品如糖、盐、布、火柴等日用必需品的价格降低了。布价格调低了百分之三点五。现仅从布、毛巾、袜子、卫生衫裤四种商品统计，去年一年来共为城乡人民节省五千六百三十一亿余元。其中绝大部分是销往农村的。生产资料方面，肥田粉的价格一九五三年比一九五一年每斤降低二百元，去年合作社供应的肥田粉将近五十万吨，仅这一项就为农民节省近两千亿元。
    在农民踊跃出售余粮给国家期间，国营商业组织供应农村的物资，数量之大、品种之多是历史上空前的。如把去年十一月到今年一月和前年十一月到去年一月做比较，在农村销售最普遍的商品销售量，煤油增加百分之九十六点二八，火柴增加百分之七十一点六七，袜子增加百分之九十五点八，毛巾增加百分之六十四点一八。上海、天津、沈阳、武汉、重庆等几个工业较集中的大城市，从去年八月开始，就把各种货物运到各中小城市和广大农村特别是粮产区去。东北、华北、中南在去年第四季度调拨到农村的百货数量，比前年同期增加百分之三十以上。各地国营商业部门，批发给合作社的商品销售额占各该部门销售总额的百分比，从计划收购前的百分之十到二十，增加到计划收购粮食后的百分之三十到四十。
    为了使物资尽可能适应农村市场需要，全国各大区和大城市国营商业部门和合作社还抽出人员深入粮产区调查农民出售余粮后对生活用品、生产物资的需要的情况，用各种办法组织适合农村需要的物资下乡。大量运到农村中去的农民包头用的大条白毛巾、合股的粗线袜子、开襟绒衣、小型香肥皂、价钱便宜的纸烟等，在农村都极受欢迎。东北国营商业部门运到农村去的防寒用品，由于适当照顾了各地农民的特点，受到农民的欢迎。
    与供应生活资料同时，全国各地供销合作社十分重视生产资料的供应，特别是春耕生产资料的供应。在计划收购的三个月中，据不完全统计，全国合作社系统供应农村的生产资料总值超过了上年同期的三倍以上。河南、山东、河北、山西、四川、绥远、宁夏、新疆等八个省十七个县的不完全统计，去年第四季度内，合作社利用物资交流会采取为农民代购等方式，组织供应给农民的牲畜共有二万九千六百多头。内蒙古自治区和山东、河北、山西、河南、热河、黑龙江等省的供销合作社，也大力卖出或买进牲口。其他各种农具的供应数量也大大超过往年。在国家各项基本建设需要大批木材的情况下，去年年底国家还拨出木材十五万立方公尺给各地供销合作社，供应农村春天制造农具和修建房屋等需要。制造农具的钢铁除靠国家供应外，全国合作社在去冬就开始大量收购废钢铁，计划到今春以九万一千吨铁解决农村手工业的原料问题。
    为了适当满足农民春耕扩大生产的要求，现在全国各地供销合作社，都把组织生产资料供应农村，支援春耕，作为当前的紧急任务。华北区合作社系统已扩大生产资料的经营，增设生产资料门市部、货摊和加工厂等。华东各地供销合作社有的召开物资交流会，有的召集当地手工业生产合作社和手工业代表举行产销会议，研究扩大生产资料供应的办法。（新华社）
