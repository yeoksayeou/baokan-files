Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: New York dispatch: People in Latin America are widely protesting the United States' policy of promoting slavery in Latin America at the Pan-American Conference and expressing support for Guatemala's struggle against U.S. interference in its internal affairs at the conference.

	In Uruguay, various enterprises held gatherings to condemn the U.S. delegation's attempt to use the conference to intensify the enslavement of Latin American countries and suppress national liberation movements. Many labor organizations, such as the Uruguayan Leather and Shoemaking Workers' Union, the Construction Workers' Union, Montevideo dockworkers, aluminum factory workers, and many other workers, are opposing the Pan-American Conference. Cesar Reyes Daglio, secretary of the Printing Workers' Union, said that the purpose of the Caracas conference was to intensify the persecution of trade unions. Ilario González, leader of the Seamen's Union, pointed out that Uruguayan sailors would not allow the implementation of the Dulles Plan.

	The preparatory committee for the "Brazilian National Liberation" conference issued an "Open Letter to the Brazilian People," exposing the colonial aims of the Tenth Pan-American Conference. The letter pointed out that the conference was a "conspiracy against the Latin American people's liberation movement." The letter said that the so-called "international communist interference in the affairs of American continent countries" was an excuse fabricated by imperialists to declare the people's liberation movements in colonies and dependencies illegal. The purpose of the Tenth Pan-American Conference was to eliminate human rights in the Americas and "permanently eliminate the right of self-determination of the Latin American people."

	Sixty-eight members of the Chilean Congress sent a telegram to Guatemalan Foreign Minister Toriello, who was attending the Pan-American Conference, assuring him that they would support Guatemala when its sovereignty was threatened.

Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: TASS, New York, March 16th: On March 12, more than 1,000 people held a rally at Manhattan Plaza Hall to express their opposition to interference in Guatemala's internal affairs. Professor Robert Morse Lovett, former Governor of the Virgin Islands, denounced the United Fruit Company's activities to undermine Guatemala's land reform. He said that the United States was using the excuse of "opposing communism" to "interfere in any Latin American people who maintain their national independence."

	Paul Robeson said that the American working people stand on the side of the Guatemalan people.

	The conference passed a resolution expressing its determination to tell the American people "the dangers of our current policy so that they will rise up against interference in Guatemala's internal affairs."

    拉丁美洲各国人民反对美国推行奴役政策
    纽约人民集会反对美国干涉危地马拉内政
   【新华社十七日讯】纽约消息：拉丁美洲人民广泛抗议美国在泛美会议上推行奴役拉丁美洲的政策，并表示支持危地马拉在会上的反对美国干涉内政的斗争。
    在乌拉圭，各企业举行各种集会，谴责美国代表团企图利用这次会议来加紧奴役拉丁美洲国家和镇压民族解放运动。许多工人组织，如乌拉圭皮革与制鞋工人工会、建筑工人工会、蒙得维的亚码头工人、制铝工厂工人和其他许多工人都在反对泛美会议。印刷工人联合会秘书塞萨尔·雷耶斯·达格利奥说，加拉加斯会议的目的是要加紧迫害工会。海员工会领导人伊拉里奥·冈萨列斯指出，乌拉圭的海员不让执行杜勒斯计划。
      “巴西民族解放”会议筹备委员会发表了“告巴西人民书”，揭露第十届泛美会议的殖民目的。告人民书指出，这次会议是一个“反对拉丁美洲人民解放运动的阴谋”。告人民书说，所谓“国际共产主义干涉美洲大陆国家事务”的问题，是帝国主义者为了宣布殖民地和附属国中的人民解放运动为非法而捏造的借口。第十届泛美会议的目的，是要在美洲大陆上消灭人权，“永远取消拉丁美洲人民的自决权”。
    智利六十八名国会议员给出席泛美会议的危地马拉外交部长托里埃略一封电报，向他保证当危地马拉的主权遭到威胁时，他们将支持危地马拉。
   【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十六日讯：三月十二日，一千多人在“曼哈顿普拉萨堂”举行大会，表示反对干涉危地马拉内政。前维尔京群岛总督罗伯特·摩尔斯·罗维特教授斥责联合果品公司进行的破坏危地马拉土地改革的活动。他说，美国借口“反对共产主义”来“干涉任何维护本国独立的拉丁美洲人民”。
    保罗·罗伯逊说，美国劳动人民站在危地马拉人民一方面。
    大会通过了一个决议，表示决心告诉美国人民“我们目前的政策的危险性，以便使他们起来反对干涉危地马拉的内政”。
