Comrades and friends,

Our Korean People's Delegation, entrusted by the fatherland and the people, has come to Beijing, the capital of the great People's Republic of China, to extend our warm congratulations to the entire Chinese people for their brilliant achievements in the struggle to build a new China, through you.

The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has a long history. Especially in the just Fatherland Liberation War of the Korean people against the American imperialist aggressors, the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people was further consolidated and developed.

All the Korean people extend warm gratitude and honor to the great Chinese people and their great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, who held high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea during the just Fatherland Liberation War, supported our struggle in various ways, especially by dispatching the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to aid us with their blood, and who continue to provide us with fraternal assistance in the post-war reconstruction period.

The task of the Korean People's Delegation is to learn from the achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in the struggle for socialist construction under the wise leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong; and to convey it to the Korean people. It is to further consolidate the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people, forged in blood, and to promote and develop cultural exchanges between the two peoples.

We are confident that with the active assistance of the Chinese people, our Korean People's Delegation will brilliantly accomplish this glorious task.

Finally, on behalf of the Korean People's Delegation, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the people of all circles in Beijing for their warm welcome.

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the eternal friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the internationalist friendship and solidarity of the world's peace-loving democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!

Long live Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union!
