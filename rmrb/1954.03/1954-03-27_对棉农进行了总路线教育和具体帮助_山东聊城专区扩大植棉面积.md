　　Through General Line Education and Concrete Assistance
　　Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, Expands Cotton Planting Area

　　Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, has reversed the trend of farmers reducing cotton fields, and the planned cotton planting area has reached 2.37 million mu, exceeding the original target by 20,000 mu.

　　In reversing the trend of farmers reducing cotton fields, Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, first educated cadres, cooperative members, mutual aid team leaders, and model workers on the general line. In the two enlarged meetings of the prefectural party committee held this year and the instructions issued by the prefectural commissioner's office in mid-February, the leadership specifically emphasized expanding the planting area of cash crops and proposed that the cotton planting area should generally increase by 5% compared to last year. At mutual aid and cooperation training classes and model worker meetings, the prefecture and county leadership mobilized and educated more than 6,000 cooperative members, mutual aid team leaders, and model workers, pointing out the significant importance of planting cotton for supplying the needs of national industry and the people, and explaining the 1954 grain-cotton price ratio policy, which had a great effect. Many people said that they would go back and communicate with cooperative members, team members, and individual farmers to appropriately expand cotton fields. Fang Xizhong, a farmer from Shazhen in the seventh district, said: "Our team originally only planned to plant 10 mu of cotton, enough for our team's use. We didn't consider the needs of the country. Now we understand the significance of increasing cotton production. This time, when I go back, I will plant 25 mu of cotton."

　　The district also carried out propaganda and education to the vast number of farmers. Before carrying out propaganda to the farmers, they first understood the farmers' reluctance to plant more cotton, and then, in response to the farmers' thoughts, carried out education on the national general line, pointing out that planting cotton is of great benefit to the country and the farmers, and guiding the farmers to revise the cotton planting plan. The Zeng Guangfu Cooperative in Shen County originally planned to reduce cotton fields by 50% compared to last year. After ideological education, it was decided that the cotton planting area would be increased by 66% compared to the original plan. When leading farmers to revise the cotton planting plan, all localities first focused on deliberating the revision of the plan within cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and then led the farmers of the whole village and township to expand the cotton planting area. For example, after the Zeng Guangfu Cooperative in Shen County revised the plan, the cooperative cadres introduced it at the mass meeting and reviewed the erroneous idea of not wanting to expand cotton fields, leading the whole village to increase the cotton planting area by 44% compared to last year.

　　Liaocheng Prefecture helped farmers solve specific problems in a timely manner, which was the key to promoting farmers to increase cotton planting. First of all, attention was paid to doing a good job in planned supply, eliminating farmers' ideological concerns. For example, after Tianqi Temple Village in the fourth district of Gaotang issued grain purchase certificates to Li Chunliang's team in a timely manner, team member Jiang Fengqi said: "Planting cotton still means having grain to eat. All my land suitable for planting cotton will be planted with cotton this year." Later, the whole team revised the plan to expand cotton fields. Secondly, preparations were made for the supply of means of production. Now, the difficulty of seed shortage and the problem of insufficient fertilizer in the district have been largely resolved. Agricultural tools and pesticides have been distributed to the counties, and cooperatives are promoting sales. Thirdly, all counties have used one or two days in mutual aid and cooperation training classes to explain and discuss farming techniques, especially cotton cultivation techniques. County technology promotion stations have printed and distributed technical introductions, going deep into villages, cooperatives, and teams to summarize the experience of the masses and help the masses. Fourthly, in order to ensure timely sowing and achieve complete and vigorous spring seedlings, all counties grasped the leadership to help farmers prevent drought and preserve soil moisture before and after the Spring Festival, and under the leadership of mutual aid teams and cooperatives, helped individual farmers carry out spring plowing, spring harrowing, drought prevention and soil moisture preservation activities. Now the soil moisture in the district is good, and most of it can be sown in a timely manner.

　　After taking the above specific measures, Liaocheng Prefecture not only reversed the trend of farmers reducing cotton fields, but also made the planned cotton planting area in the entire district exceed the tasks stipulated by the higher authorities. Now farmers are actively carrying out various preparations for planting cotton.

    对棉农进行了总路线教育和具体帮助
    山东聊城专区扩大植棉面积
    山东省聊城专区扭转了农民缩小棉田的趋势，计划植棉的面积已达二百三十七万亩，超过原规定任务两万亩。
    山东省聊城专区在扭转农民缩小棉田的趋势时，首先对干部、合作社、互助组骨干、劳动模范进行了关于增植棉花的教育。在今年召开的两次地委扩大会议及专署二月中旬下达的指示中，领导方面都特别强调扩大经济作物的种植面积，提出了棉花的种植面积，一般的比去年增加百分之五的要求。专区、县领导方面在互助合作训练班中，在劳动模范会议上，对六千多名合作社、互助组骨干及劳动模范，进行了动员和教育，指出了种植棉花对供应国家工业和人民需要的重大意义，讲解了一九五四年的粮棉比价政策，收到很大效果。许多人都表示要回去打通社员、组员和单干农民的思想，适当扩大棉田，七区沙镇农民房西忠说：“我组原先只打算种棉花十亩，够本组用的就行，没考虑国家需要，现在明白增产棉花的意义了，这次回去要种棉花二十五亩。”
    该区还向广大农民进行了宣传教育。在向农民进行宣传前，就先了解农民不愿多种棉田的思想情况，然后针对农民的思想，进行国家总路线的教育，指出种棉对国家和对农民都有很大好处，领导农民修订植棉计划。莘县曾广福社，原来打算比去年缩小棉田百分之五十，经过思想教育后，决定植棉面积比原计划增加百分之六十六。各地在领导农民修订植棉计划时，都是先有重点地在合作社、互助组内酝酿修订计划，然后带动全村全乡农民扩大植棉面积。如莘县曾广福社修订计划以后，社里干部就在群众会上介绍，并检讨了不愿扩大棉田的错误思想，带动全村比去年增加了植棉面积百分之四十四。
    聊城专区各地，及时帮助农民解决具体问题，是推动农民增植棉花的关键。首先是注意作好计划供应工作，解除农民思想顾虑，如高唐四区天齐庙村给李春良组及时发下购粮证后，组员姜凤起就说：“种棉花一样有粮食吃，我的适合种棉花的地今年都要种棉花了。”后来全组都修订了扩大棉田的计划。其次，是作好生产资料供应的准备。现在该区缺种籽的困难，肥料不足的问题，大部分都已得到解决，农具农药已经分到各县，合作社正在推销。第三，各县都通过互助合作训练班抽出一、两天时间讲解和讨论了耕作技术，特别是棉花栽培技术，县技术推广站都印发了技术介绍，深入到村、社、组总结群众中的经验，帮助群众。第四，为了保证适时下种，达到春苗齐全旺盛，各县在春节前后就抓紧领导农民防旱保墒，在互助组、合作社带动下，帮助单干农民开展了春耕、春耙、防旱保墒运动，现在全区墒情良好，大部都能够适时下种。
    聊城专区采取了以上各项具体措施以后，不但扭转了农民缩小棉田的趋势，而且使全区计划种棉的面积超过了上级所规定的任务。现在农民正在积极进行种棉的各项准备工作。
