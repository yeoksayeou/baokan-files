    Opposing Formalism in Tree Planting Campaigns
    Reader Wu Yajun writes: Every spring, the Fuyang County People's Government in Anhui Province mobilizes cadres, students, and residents in the urban area to carry out tree planting campaigns. The Fuyang Special District Farm provides the county with over ten thousand saplings each spring. These saplings are planted annually on the city walls and along the major and minor roads leading from the county seat in all directions; however, by summer, the saplings become dry firewood, and soon they are pulled up and burned for fuel. This cycle of planting trees year after year, without seeing them grow, is a great waste. Now that the tree planting season is here again, the Fuyang County People's Government must correct its past formalistic practices and take proper measures after planting to ensure that the planted trees can survive, that people's labor can achieve the desired results, and that Fuyang County can become a city surrounded by greenery in a few years.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    反对形式主义的植树运动
    读者吴亚军来信：安徽省阜阳县人民政府每年春季都发动城区的干部、学生和居民开展植树运动，阜阳专区农场每年春季都供给该县一万余株树苗。这些树苗年年都栽在城墙上及从县城通向各方的大小公路两旁；可是一到夏季树苗就成为干柴，不久就被人拔掉烧火了。这样年年栽树，年年不见成长，真是一个很大的浪费。目前又是植树季节，阜阳县人民政府必须纠正过去形式主义的做法，在植树后采取妥善措施，使种植的树木能够成活，使人们的劳动能收到应有的效果，使阜阳县在几年后能成为一座绿荫围绕的城市。
