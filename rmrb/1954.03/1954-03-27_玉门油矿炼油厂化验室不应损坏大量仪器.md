Yumen Oilfield Refinery Laboratory Should Not Damage Large Quantities of Instruments

Reader Du Ming writes: The Yumen Oilfield Refinery Laboratory damaged a total of 105 pieces of laboratory equipment in the 72 days from December 1st of last year to February 10th of this year, averaging about one and a half pieces of equipment damaged per day. The director of the laboratory frequently went to the factory director to complain that there were not enough instruments and asked for additions, even suggesting that "instruments be quickly transported from Shanghai by plane." When leading comrades asked, "Why are the instruments being damaged so quickly?" the director said, "Alas! There are many apprentices, and their skills are not proficient."

Is the reason for the large-scale damage to instruments really due to the apprentices' lack of technical proficiency? In fact, it is not. Apprentice Guo Zhi, although not proficient in his skills, has never damaged a single instrument in his work. So, what is the real reason? Let's look at the actual situation!

The motor in the laboratory had been malfunctioning for a long time. Although everyone had made many suggestions for timely repairs, the director of the laboratory did not pay attention to it. Assistant technician Chen Longnian took the initiative to repair it, but the director criticized him, "Why did you repair it without going through me?" But he forgot that he had the responsibility to order relevant personnel to repair the malfunctioning motor in a timely manner. As a result, the motor burned out, and the octane rating machine had to stop production.

The labor discipline of some staff members in the laboratory is lax, and no one cares. Some people do private things during working hours, and some even arbitrarily do not come to work. Some staff members damaged seven instruments in just over two months. However, in order to avoid "undermining" the work morale of the laboratory personnel, the director of the laboratory neither criticized those who arbitrarily did not come to work nor reported them to the personnel department; no one was held accountable for who damaged the instruments, and no one educated everyone to learn from the lessons, let alone launched criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, this situation has not been corrected.

The serious damage to instruments directly affected production. For example, after the pour point thermometer was damaged, the pour point of the cold pressing plant could not be measured in time, making production impossible. The director of the laboratory must pay close attention to this issue, seriously check the work, and strengthen ideological education work for the staff, rectify labor discipline, and correct this bad phenomenon of damaging a large number of instruments.

### 玉门油矿炼油厂化验室不应损坏大量仪器

专栏：读者来信摘要

    玉门油矿炼油厂化验室不应损坏大量仪器
    读者杜明来信：玉门油矿炼油厂化验室从去年十二月一日到今年二月十日的七十二天中，共损坏化验仪器一百零五件，平均每天损坏仪器约一件半。化验室主任经常跑到厂长那里去诉说仪器不够用，要求添置，有时甚至提出要“赶快用飞机从上海运仪器来”。领导同志问：“为什么仪器损坏得这样快？”主任说：“唉！学徒多，技术不熟练。”
    仪器大量损坏的原因真的是学徒技术不熟练吗？事实上并不如此。学徒郭智技术虽然不熟练，在工作中，却从来没有损坏过一件仪器。那么，真正原因究竟是什么呢？让我们来看实际情况吧！
    化验室的马达很早就有了毛病，虽然大家提出很多意见，要求及时修理，但是并没有引起化验室主任的重视。助理技术员陈隆年曾主动地去修理，主任反而批评他：“为什么不通过我就修理呢？”但是他却忘记了自己有责任命令有关人员及时修理有毛病的马达。结果，马达烧坏了，辛烷值机器就只能停止生产。
    化验室部分工作人员的劳动纪律松弛，无人过问。有人在工作时间内做私事，有的甚至任意不上班。有的工作人员在两个多月中就搞坏了七件仪器。但是，化验室主任为了避免“打击”化验人员的工作情绪，对于任意不上班的人，既不提出批评，也不向人事股作汇报；谁打坏了仪器，也不追究原因，教育大家接受教训，更没有展开批评和自我批评。因此，这种情况就一直不能得到纠正。
    严重损坏仪器的结果，直接影响了生产。例如倾点温度计损坏后，冷榨厂的倾点不能及时测定，使生产不能进行。化验室主任必须切实重视这个问题，认真检查一下工作，并对工作人员加强思想教育工作，整顿劳动纪律，纠正这种大量损坏仪器的不良现象。
