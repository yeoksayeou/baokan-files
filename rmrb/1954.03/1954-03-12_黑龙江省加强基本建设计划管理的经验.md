Heilongjiang Province, based on the characteristics of basic construction and its existing management level, focused on strengthening planning management in all its work last year. During the spring construction preparation phase, emphasis was placed on compiling construction organization designs, conducting year-round engineering scheduling, and balancing design, materials, equipment and tools, labor, and finance. After construction began, the focus shifted to promoting operational planning, establishing accountability systems, and implementing mass quality inspections. During the increase production and practice economy movement, the focus was on mass campaigns centered around the compilation and implementation of completion operation plans. In total, all sixteen construction units in the province compiled construction organization designs before construction, and dispatch organizations were generally established. Operational plans were implemented on sixty-two out of seventy-one construction sites in the province.

The gains from strengthening planning management are significant. First, it accelerated project progress, ensured quality, and reduced waste. The compilation of construction organization designs provided a planned and orderly approach to site layout and all preparation work, reducing chaos and blind spots, avoiding much waste, and creating favorable conditions for construction. For example, the reasonable stacking of materials greatly reduced short-distance transportation, preventing roads from being blocked by sand and gravel, and making them convenient to use when needed. The 401 construction site of the Construction Engineering Bureau placed small stones used for the foundation on the inner layer, larger stones in the middle layer, and bricks on the outer layer, saving 120 million yuan in short-distance transportation alone. At the same time, labor and tools could also be prepared thoughtfully and reasonably; the fact that there were no major problems with water and electricity for construction this year is also largely related to the compilation of construction organization designs. As for the implementation of construction operation plans, it not only accelerated the progress of the project but also played a significant role in ensuring quality and conserving resources. Some construction sites, due to the implementation of operational plans, were completed more than forty days ahead of the national schedule, saving several hundred million yuan in material costs, and the quality was also very good. In the completion phase, many construction sites implemented completion operation plans, enabling miscellaneous finishing projects to be carried out in an orderly manner, preventing delays in completion projects.

Due to the strengthening of planning management, the management level of construction enterprises has also been improved. Construction organization designs and operational plans acted like a red thread, organizing the work of various departments, processing plants, and the actions of all employees, enabling everyone to arrange their work around the plan, cooperate with each other, and strive together as a whole towards a common goal. This enabled leading cadres and site directors of each unit to have a clear understanding of the situation. As a result of last year's practice, each unit has accumulated some experience in this area, laying the foundation for further improving management levels this year. For example, this year's construction organization designs have been greatly improved compared to last year.

The implementation of operational plans has also enhanced the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers. Workers said, "With an operational plan, there is something to strive for, and working is also more enjoyable." Many worker groups often proactively requested the next period's plan from the leadership, feeling that without a plan, there would be no direction. In order to complete the operational plan, the attendance rate of workers has also increased. Units with better implementation of operational plans often maintained an attendance rate of around 94 to 95 percent. Some workers even postponed their wedding dates or worked in the rain without resting in order to complete the operational plan.

Finally, the implementation of operational plans has given political work a lively and concrete content and provided specific goals for labor emulation campaigns. Some workers without operational plans requested plans from the leadership, feeling that without a plan, they could not compete and could not see whether they had completed and exceeded the task.

The above is what Heilongjiang Province has gained from implementing planning management over the past year. The main points of experience are as follows:

(1) It is necessary to pay attention to the laws and characteristics of basic construction, with construction organization designs and construction operation plans as the two basic links. A comprehensive construction organization design should be prepared in the construction preparation stage, and construction operation plans should be implemented during construction. Without a construction organization design, it is impossible to prevent chaotic phenomena on the site, and the operation plan will lose its basis; and the construction operation plan is the most effective method to implement the construction organization design, and also the central link to implement planning management.

When compiling and implementing construction organization designs and operation plans, attention must be paid to adopting advanced parallel flow operation methods. For example, the engineering team of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant not only adopted parallel flow operations between projects and between construction teams in the construction organization design and operation plan, but also implemented flow operations and professional division of labor within the same construction team. This not only accelerated the progress but also ensured the quality, avoiding the problem of some construction sites advancing on all fronts, resulting in some trades being busy and others idle, technical workers doing the work of ordinary workers, and the project being loose at the beginning and tight at the end.

When compiling construction organization designs and operation plans, it is also necessary to pay attention to the different characteristics of the early, middle, and late stages of construction. For example, in the early stage of construction, when workers first enter the site, there may be many shortcomings in the preparation work such as water and electricity supply, tools and equipment, and workers' lives; ordinary workers and technical workers may not be in harmony; underground foundation projects may also have unexpected obstacles such as large stones and tomb pits; in addition, advanced experiences have not been promoted, and most workers may not reach the national labor quotas. Therefore, on the one hand, the construction organization design should make plans for measures to solve the problems that may occur during this period; at the same time, the requirements for labor efficiency should not be too high during this period. After a period of time, the preparation work is more complete, and the workers are also more comfortable to work, and the labor efficiency can be required higher when compiling the plan, but at this time, the impact of rainy days between summer and autumn should also be estimated. By the time of the finishing project, the weather is cold, the days are short, the work is sporadic, and there is a lot of cooperation between trades. At this time, it should be estimated that the work efficiency of some trades will decline. In short, these characteristics must be noted when compiling the plan, and the labor time quota should be continuously grasped during construction, and the original records should be strengthened to ensure the advanced and practical nature of the operation plan.

In strengthening planning management, balance work must also be done well. Balance work is an indispensable condition for compiling and implementing construction organization designs and construction operation plans, and it is also a comprehensive inspection of construction preparation work. The main contents of the balance are design, materials, tools and equipment, labor, and finance, and the method is to hold balance meetings attended by responsible cadres and activists of relevant business departments every month. When balancing during construction, special attention should be paid to the connection and balance between processes, the connection between semi-finished products of processing plants and the on-site construction plan, so that the operation plans of construction sites, construction sections, and groups and the supply plans of materials, tools and equipment, labor, and semi-finished products of processing plants are connected to each other to form a whole plan. Otherwise, if the above-mentioned departments make their own plans and do not organize balance, the entire construction plan will inevitably go bankrupt.

(2) Strengthening planning management must implement the mass line. The practices of construction units throughout the province are roughly two types. The first practice can be exemplified by the engineering team of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant. When compiling construction organization designs and operation plans, they gathered 56 technical personnel, work area directors, construction workers, worker group leaders, and veteran technical workers to form eleven groups for carpentry, bricklaying, concrete, electrical, materials, tools and equipment, and labor wages. They divided the work and cooperated to compile, and finally integrated. The advantage of doing this is to ensure the feasibility of the plan, solve the difficulties of insufficient technical cadres, and strengthen the combination of technical personnel and workers. Technical personnel from the departments raised questions from the technical requirements and calculation aspects, and workers and construction workers raised questions from the practical experience aspects, and both sides improved. After the plan was compiled, they mobilized all workers to discuss the construction plan progress and construction methods, quality standard section, and mobilized various departments to discuss parts related to themselves. In the implementation of the plan, they regularly mobilized workers to check the implementation of the plan and often listened to the opinions of workers on the plan, thereby ensuring the implementation of the plan and improving the level of the plan. The second practice is the opposite of the first one. The operation plan is compiled by the construction planning section or a few engineering and technical personnel based on the intentions of the leadership and some technical documents. As a result, the plan is not practical and the enthusiasm of the masses has not been brought into play. This is one of the basic reasons why the construction plan of most construction sites failed repeatedly last year.

(3) The implementation of construction operation plans should be from low to high, gradually improved. At the beginning of the implementation of construction operation plans in Heilongjiang Province, it was emphasized that the implementation should start from the main projects and main trades of the construction site, and gradually expand to secondary trades, and gradually expand from the construction site to the processing plant and departments related to technical supply. The content of the operation plan also requires that the operation plan should be gradually simplified and concise to scientific and complete. If the operation plan is required to be complex and comprehensive at the beginning, it will not be easy for employees to grasp, but it will not be able to be implemented. Of course, it is also wrong to be satisfied with low-level operation plans, not to pay attention to improving the quality of the plan in the implementation, not to pay attention to the coordination and connection of various plans, and not to pay attention to summarizing experiences and lessons like some construction sites.

(4) The implementation of construction operation plans must grasp the following links:

First, establish and implement the responsibility system. To implement construction organization designs and operation plans, there must be a strict responsibility system as a guarantee. The first is the system of one chief and area management, especially the grass-roots responsibility system. It is necessary to clearly stipulate that from the site director to the group leader, they must be fully responsible for completing their operation plan. All trades in the construction site and construction section must obey the plan and allocation of the construction site and construction section leader, otherwise the construction operation plan will be in a state of no one being responsible, or will be destroyed due to lack of cooperation. The second is the technical quality responsibility system. Special technical personnel should put forward technical measures to ensure the operation plan in time according to the construction operation plan, so as to prevent technical accidents and affect the timely completion of the construction operation plan. The third is the technical supply responsibility system. The material, labor, and tool and equipment departments should formulate supply plans and material quality inspection, storage, and transportation systems according to the requirements of the construction operation plan to ensure that the construction needs are met and waste and backlog are prevented. Finally, the dispatch responsibility system must also be clearly defined. It is necessary to correct the phenomenon that the dispatch office is regarded as a business office or the dispatch office takes over the work of other departments and becomes a "general affairs agency."

Second, give play to the role of the dispatch organization. The task of dispatch work is to supervise the implementation of construction operation plans and help overcome all obstacles in the normal progress of the project. To give play to the role of the dispatch organization, in addition to clearly defining the dispatch responsibility system, the dispatch work must be valued both from above and below. When the leadership handles matters within the scope of dispatch work, it must go through the dispatch organization; and it must often participate in dispatch meetings and check dispatch work. On the one hand, dispatch personnel must often go deep into the site, grasp the daily project progress and the completion of construction operation plans, as well as the technical supply situation, and assist leading cadres in solving key problems in the project; on the other hand, they should maintain close contact with relevant parties and actively participate in the construction organization design and construction operation plan. The compilation of the plan is of great importance to the dispatch work itself and to the compilation of the plan.

Third, strengthen technical management and implement the economic accounting system. Strengthening technical management is one of the important factors to ensure quality and ensure the timely realization of the plan. The construction operation plan must have a corresponding technical measure plan as a guarantee. Such as doing a good job in drawing review and research, explaining drawings, quality standards and operating procedures at all levels, strengthening technical inspection, and solving technical problems in the project in time, so as to prevent technical accidents, ensure project quality and construction period, and avoid waste. In terms of economic accounting, various quotas should be strictly controlled, labor should be properly allocated, material backlog should be prevented, and material receiving and issuing systems should be improved. In order to complete the operation plan, some construction sites blindly allocated a large amount of labor, causing great losses to the country. This practice must be opposed.

Fourth, vigorously promote advanced experience and carry out labor emulation. Only the operation plan compiled based on the conditions for promoting advanced experience is an advanced operation plan; only the practical promotion of advanced experience can ensure the realization and exceeding of the operation plan. Many construction sites and worker groups have listed the promotion of advanced experience as the main measure to ensure the realization of the operation plan. For example, after the Han Jingyou plastering team of the Industrial Engineering Company promoted nine advanced experiences, it completed the half-month plan in eleven days. Labor emulation is a powerful tool to stimulate and organize the broad masses of workers to complete the operation plan. Taking the guarantee of completing the operation plan as the central content and carrying out evaluation according to the completion cycle of the operation plan is one of the characteristics of labor emulation in the basic construction sector last year.

(5) The implementation of planning management must have strong political and ideological work. Heilongjiang Province's experience in this regard is: First, political work must be carried out according to the characteristics of different periods. For example, in the early stage of implementing planning management, it is necessary to oppose the "conditional theory" that emphasizes the complexity and changes of basic construction, so it is impossible to implement planning management, and the idea of canceling the plan such as being afraid of "trouble" and "the same construction without a plan," as well as the subjectivism of technical personnel in compiling plans that deviate from reality. For example, when workers generally fail to meet the quotas at the beginning of construction, it becomes the center of political work to mobilize workers to find tricks and promote advanced experience to break through the quotas. When construction is tense, it is necessary to prevent the idea of rushing progress and neglecting quality. In the final stage of the project, it is necessary to oppose the negative emotions that think that the work is sporadic, it is not easy to make plans, and that the project "has passed the big head" and does not pay attention to the plan. Second, the general problems in construction are to pay attention to speed and neglect quality and savings, and safety is rarely considered. Therefore, when strengthening planning management, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive education of "good, fast, saving, and safe" to all workers, otherwise it will cause major losses. Third, attention should be paid to the overall ideological education in the implementation of the plan. It is necessary to educate employees to understand that the previous process must create conditions for the next process to complete the plan, and the secondary project plan must obey the main project plan. Between the construction unit (Party B) and the contracting unit (Party A), it is also necessary to overcome the reliance, evasion, mutual shirk, and other departmentalism ideas that affect the completion of the plan.

These are some of the experiences of Heilongjiang Province in implementing planning management. However, since planning management is a new work in Heilongjiang Province, there is a lack of experience, and some grass-roots cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of planning management, so there are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, the phenomenon that the construction organization design and operation plan are not practical and not comprehensive is more common. The leadership pays more attention to the operation plan of the class team and less attention to the operation plan of the construction section and construction site. Some only compile plans according to national quotas, do not analyze the original records, and require bricklayers to build 1,300 bricks a day from the start of construction to the completion, and do not consider the different technical levels of each group. Some only have construction section plans but no semi-finished product processing and material and labor supply plans, and some only have plans for major trades and major sub-project items, but no operation plans for secondary trades. No one is responsible for implementing the construction organization design, and most of them only played a certain role in the construction preparation stage, and no one cared about it after the start of construction. There are very few who adhere to the operation plan to the end and implement it well. Although the dispatch organization has been generally established, it is also a minority that really plays a role. In terms of political work, there are shortcomings such as only paying attention to mobilizing workers to complete the plan, and not paying attention to the compilation of the plan by department technical personnel. These shortcomings must be overcome in this year's work.

    黑龙江省加强基本建设计划管理的经验
    去年，黑龙江省根据基本建设的特点和现有的管理水平，以加强计划管理为中心进行了各项工作。在春季施工准备阶段，强调了编制施工组织设计，进行全年工程排队和设计、材料、设备工具、劳动力、财务等项工作的平衡；施工开始以后，以推行作业计划为中心进行了建立责任制与群众性的质量检查；增产节约运动中，又以编制与贯彻竣工作业计划为中心开展了群众性的竞赛。总计全省十六个施工单位都在施工前编制了施工组织设计，并普遍建立了调度组织；全省七十一个工地中有六十二个推行了作业计划。
    加强计划管理的收获是很大的。首先是加快了工程进度，保证了质量，减少了浪费。由于编制了施工组织设计，使现场布置各项准备工作与全年工作有了计划和秩序，减少了混乱与盲目性，避免了许多浪费，给施工创造了有利条件。如材料堆放合理就大大减少了小运搬，不至于被砂子石子挡住道路，用的时候也方便。建筑工程局四○一工地将地基先用的小石块放在里层，后用的大石块放在中间，砖放在外层，仅小运搬一项就节省了一亿二千万元。同时，劳动力与工具也能准备得周到合理；今年施工用的水电没有发生多大问题和编制施工组织设计也有很大关系。至于施工作业计划的贯彻，不仅加速了工程进度，而且对保证质量和节约也起了很大作用。有些工地因推行了作业计划，比国家要求提前四十多天竣工，节省了材料费几亿元，质量也很好。在竣工阶段，许多工地推行了竣工作业计划，使零星的结尾工程能够有秩序地进行，防止了结尾工程的拖延。
    由于计划管理的加强，也提高了建筑企业的管理水平。施工组织设计与作业计划像一条红线似的将各个科室、各个加工厂的工作和全体职工的行动组织了起来，使大家围绕着计划安排自己的工作，互相配合衔接成为一个整体，共同为一个目标而奋斗。这样就使各单位的领导干部与工地主任都做到了心中有数。去年实践的结果，各单位都在这方面积累了一些经验，为今年进一步提高管理水平打下了基础。例如今年的施工组织设计就比去年有了很大改进。
    由于推行作业计划，还提高了广大职工的积极性和创造性。工人说：“有了作业计划，有个奔头，干活也痛快。”不少工人小组经常主动地事先向领导上要下期计划，感到没有计划就没有了方向。为了完成作业计划，工人的出勤率也提高了。作业计划推行得较好的单位，出勤率经常保持百分之九十四五左右。有的工人为了完成作业计划，甚至推迟结婚日期，或者冒雨干活不肯休息。
    最后，由于推行作业计划，使政治工作与经济工作的结合有了生动具体的内容，劳动竞赛也有了具体目标。有些没有作业计划的工人就要求领导上给他们计划，觉得没有计划就不能竞赛，看不出自己是否完成和超过了任务。
    上述这些就是黑龙江省一年来贯彻计划管理的收获。在经验方面，则主要有以下几点：
    （一）必须注意基本建设的规律和特点，以施工组织设计与施工作业计划作为两个基本环节。在施工准备阶段应做好全面的施工组织设计，在施工时应贯彻施工作业计划。没有施工组织设计就不能防止现场的混乱现象，作业计划就失去依靠；而施工作业计划又是贯彻施工组织设计最有效的方法，也是贯彻计划管理的中心环节。
    在编制与贯彻施工组织设计和作业计划时必须注意采用先进的平行流水作业方法。如齐齐哈尔市机车车辆制造厂工程队在施工组织设计和作业计划中不仅在工程之间和工种队之间采用平行流水作业、即在同一工种小组之内也实行了流水作业与专业分工。这样既加速了进度又保证了质量，避免了像有些工地齐头并进，造成工种之间忙的忙，闲的闲，技术工人做普通工人活，工程前松后紧的毛病。
    在编制施工组织设计与作业计划时，还要注意施工初期、中期、末期的不同特点。例如在施工初期，工人刚进入现场，水电供应、工具设备及工人生活等准备工作可能有很多缺点；普通工人和技术工人可能不合手；地下基础工程也可能有意外的大石、墓坑等障碍；再加上先进经验未推广，多数工人可能达不到国家规定的劳动定额。因此，一方面在施工组织设计中间要作出解决这一时期可能发生问题的措施计划；同时，这时期对劳动效率的要求也不应过高。等过了一个时期，准备工作比较周全了，工人干活也顺手了，编计划时对劳动效率就可要求得高一些，但这时也要估计夏秋之间雨天的影响。到结尾工程时，天气冷，白天短，工作零星，工种之间配合多，这时又应该估计到某些工种的工作效率将会下降。总之，在编制计划时必须注意这些特点，并在施工中不断掌握工时定额，加强原始纪录，以保证作业计划的先进和切实。
    在加强计划管理中间，还必须做好平衡工作。平衡工作是编制与贯彻施工组织设计及施工作业计划不可缺少的条件，也是对于施工准备工作的全面检查。平衡的主要内容是设计、材料、工具设备，劳动力与财务五个方面，其方法是按月召开有关业务部门负责干部与积极分子参加的平衡会议。在施工期间进行平衡时，应特别注意工序之间、加工工厂半成品与现场施工计划的衔接平衡，使工地、工段、小组的作业计划与材料、工具设备、劳动力及加工厂半成品的供应计划互相衔接，成为一个整体计划。否则，上述各个部门各作自己的计划，不组织平衡，势必使整个施工计划破产。
    （二）加强计划管理必须贯彻群众路线。全省各施工单位的做法大体有两种。第一种做法可以齐齐哈尔市机车车辆制造厂工程队为例。他们在编制施工组织设计与作业计划时，集中了技术人员、工区主任、施工员、工人组长和老技术工人五十六人，组成了木工、瓦工、混凝土、电气、材料、工具设备、劳动工资等十一个小组，分工合作编制，最后加以综合。这样做的好处是保证了计划的切实可行，解决了技术干部不足的困难，并加强了技术人员与工人的结合。科室技术人员由技术要求与计算方面提出问题，工人和施工员由实际经验方面提出问题，互相都有所提高。在计划编好以后，他们便发动全体工人讨论施工计划进度和施工方法、质量标准部分，发动各科室讨论与自己有关部分。在执行计划中，又定期发动工人检查计划执行情况，经常听取工人对计划的意见，从而保证了计划的实现，并提高了计划的水平。第二种做法与第一种相反，作业计划是由施工计划科或少数工程技术人员根据领导意图和部分技术文件编的，结果计划不切实，群众积极性未发挥。这是去年多数工地的施工计划一再破产的基本原因之一。
    （三）推行施工作业计划应是由低级到高级，逐步完善提高。黑龙江省在推行施工作业计划之初，强调由施工现场的主要工程和主要工种开始，逐渐扩展到次要的工种，由施工现场逐渐扩展到加工厂和与技术供应有关的科室。在作业计划的内容上也要求由简单扼要逐步达到科学完备，如果一开始就要求复杂、全面，职工不易掌握，反而推行不了。当然，像有些工地那样，满足于低级的作业计划，不在推行中注意提高计划的质量，不注意各种计划的配合衔接，不注意总结经验教训，当然也是不对的。
    （四）贯彻施工作业计划必须抓住以下几个环节：
    第一、建立与贯彻责任制。要贯彻施工组织设计与作业计划，必须要有严格的责任制作保证。这里首先是一长制与区域管理制，特别是基层责任制。要明确规定由工地主任到小组长都要对完成自己的作业计划负有完全责任。各工种在工地、工段之内都要服从该工地与工段长的计划与调配，否则施工作业计划就会处于无人负责状态，或由于互不配合而遭到破坏。其次是技术质量责任制。专责技术人员应根据施工作业计划及时提出保证作业计划的技术措施，以防止发生技术事故，影响施工作业计划的如期完成。再次是技术供应责任制。材料、劳动力、工具设备部门都应根据施工作业计划的要求订出供应计划与材料质量检查、保管、运输等制度，以保证既满足施工需要，又防止浪费与积压。最后，还必须明确规定调度责任制。必须纠正将调度室当做事务办公室或调度室包办其他部门工作成为“大杂会机关”的现象。
    第二、发挥调度组织作用。调度工作的任务是监督施工作业计划的执行，并帮助克服工程正常进行中的一切障碍。而要发挥调度组织的作用，除了明确调度责任制外，主要是上下都要重视调度工作。领导上处理属于调度工作范围的事情时，一定要通过调度组织；并要经常参加调度会议，检查调度工作。调度人员本身一方面要经常深入现场，掌握每日工程进度与施工作业计划完成情况，以及技术供应情况，协助领导干部解决工程上的关键问题；另一方面应与有关方面密切联系，积极参加施工组织设计与施工作业计划的编制工作，这对调度工作本身和编制好计划都有重要作用。
    第三、加强技术管理和贯彻经济核算制。加强技术管理是保证质量、保证计划按期实现的重要因素之一。施工作业计划必须有相应的技术措施计划作保证。如做好图纸审查研究，逐级交代图纸、质量标准和操作规程，加强技术检查，及时解决工程上的技术问题等等，以防止发生技术事故，保证工程质量和工期，避免浪费。在经济核算方面应严格掌握各种定额，正确地调配劳动力，防止材料积压健全领退料制度等等。有的工地为了完成作业计划，盲目调配大量劳动力，给国家造成了很大损失。这种做法是必须反对的。
    第四、大力推广先进经验，开展劳动竞赛。只有根据推广先进经验的条件编制的作业计划才是先进的作业计划；只有切实推广先进经验才能保证作业计划的实现和超过。有许多工地和工人小组都将推广先进经验列为保证作业计划实现的主要措施。如工业工程公司韩景有抹灰组推广了九种先进经验后，十一天完成了半月计划。劳动竞赛是激发和组织广大职工完成作业计划的有力工具。以保证完成作业计划为中心内容，并根据作业计划完成的周期进行评比，是去年基本建设部门中劳动竞赛的特点之一。
      （五）贯彻计划管理必须有强有力的政治思想工作。黑龙江省在这方面的经验是：第一、要根据各个不同时期的特点来进行政治工作。例如在推行计划管理初期，就要反对强调基本建设复杂和变化大，因而不能推行计划管理的“条件论”和怕“麻烦”与“没有计划也一样施工”等取消计划的思想，以及技术人员在编制计划中脱离实际的主观主义。再如开工初期工人普遍达不到定额，这时发动工人找窍门，推广先进经验突破定额，就成为政治工作的中心。在施工紧张时，要防止赶进度忽视质量的思想。在结尾工程阶段则要反对认为工作零星，不好作计划和觉得工程“大头过去了”，不重视计划的松劲情绪。第二、在施工中一般的毛病是注意快，忽视质量和节省，在安全方面也很少考虑。因此，在加强计划管理时，必须对全体工人进行“好、快、省、安全”的全面教育，不然就会造成重大损失。第三、要注意贯彻计划中的整体思想教育。要教育职工懂得上一工序要为下一工序完成计划创造条件，次要工程计划要服从主要工程计划。在施工单位（乙方）和发包单位（甲方）之间，也要克服依靠、推诿、互相扯皮等影响计划完成的本位主义思想。
    这些就是黑龙江省在推行计划管理中间的一些体会。但是，由于计划管理在黑龙江省是一个新的工作，经验缺乏，再加一部分基层干部对计划管理的意义认识不足，所以工作中还存在不少缺点。例如施工组织设计和作业计划不切合实际、不全面的现象比较普遍。领导上偏重班组作业计划，对工段、工地的作业计划注意得差。有的只是按照国家定额编计划，不分析原始记录，从开工到完工都要求瓦工日砌一千三百块砖，也不考虑各小组不同的技术水平。有的只有工段计划而没有加工半成品和材料、劳动力供应计划，有的只有主要工种与主要分部工程项目的计划，而没有次要工种的作业计划。施工组织设计没有专人负责贯彻，多数只是在施工准备阶段起了一定的作用，施工开始以后就无人过问了。对作业计划坚持到底，贯彻较好的是很少数。调度组织虽普遍建立，但真正发挥作用的也是少数。在政治工作方面则存在着只注意发动工人完成计划，没有注意科室技术人员编好计划等缺点。这些缺点都要在今年的工作中努力克服。
