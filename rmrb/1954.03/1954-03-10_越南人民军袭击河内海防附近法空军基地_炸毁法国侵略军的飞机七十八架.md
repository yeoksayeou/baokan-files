Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: According to Vietnam News Agency on March 8th, the Vietnamese People's Army recently attacked the French army's Gia Lam Airport near Hanoi and Cat Bi Airport near Haiphong, destroying a total of seventy-eight French aircraft, inflicting a serious blow on the French army.

On March 4th, the Vietnamese People's Army attacked the French army's Gia Lam Airport, only a few kilometers from Hanoi, destroying eighteen Dakota transport planes, one gasoline depot, and two generators.

Two days later, on the evening of March 6th, the Vietnamese People's Army attacked the French army's Cat Bi Airport, six kilometers southeast of Haiphong, completely destroying sixty enemy aircraft parked on the airfield, including thirty-eight B-26 aircraft, ten fighter-bombers, three transport planes, and nine reconnaissance planes. During the attack, a large number of bombs and shells exploded, and the explosions continued from 1:00 AM to 5:00 AM on the 7th. The explosions also destroyed some enemy aircraft. Cat Bi is one of the three largest air force bases of the French in Indochina. The enemy has expanded the airfield to allow heavy aircraft to land; American pilots and air force personnel are also stationed at this airport.

In the two days of the 4th and 6th, the Vietnamese People's Army destroyed a total of seventy-eight French aircraft. This is a major victory following the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on Tu Son Airport southeast of Haiphong on January 31st, which destroyed five French transport planes.

Since the French army suffered defeats in Lai Chau province in northwestern Vietnam and northern Laos last winter and this spring, they have had to hold out in isolated strongholds far from their bases, such as Dien Bien Phu. To supply these besieged isolated strongholds, the enemy has had to use a large number of aircraft for air transport over hundreds of kilometers. Gia Lam and Cat Bi are two of the enemy's main air force bases, from which enemy aircraft take off to transport supplies to the besieged French troops in Dien Bien Phu in northwestern Vietnam and other isolated strongholds in northern Laos. This time, the People's Army destroyed seventy-eight enemy aircraft, creating new difficulties for the enemy in terms of transportation and supply.

Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The successive attacks by the Vietnamese People's Army on the French airfields near Hanoi and near Haiphong, where American air force personnel are stationed, have caused significant losses to the French colonialists and aroused the concern of American senators.

The Associated Press reported on the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on Gia Lam Airport, not far from Hanoi city, in the early morning of the 4th, saying, "They placed containers of high explosives under the engines of one aircraft after another on the main runway of this airport," causing "a big explosion." "The sirens and the explosions at Gia Lam woke up the entire city of Hanoi." The Vietnamese People's Army's attack on Gia Lam Airport caused significant losses to the French air transport force, which is receiving increased support from the United States. The French military headquarters in Hanoi vaguely stated that the attack caused an "unspecified number" of aircraft to explode. However, United Press International revealed that "many of the aircraft destroyed were recently shipped here from the United States in order to transport more supplies and reinforcements to Dien Bien Phu." After suffering this loss, "authorities (French) expressed concern that the destruction of these aircraft would greatly reduce the amount of airlift to Dien Bien Phu, Luang Prabang, and Muong Sai."

After the attack on Gia Lam Airport, it immediately caused panic among the American air force personnel stationed at the airport near Haiphong, who were sent to participate in the Indochina War. United Press International said that initially, "it was believed that these Americans who flew in from Japan were safe because Haiphong was within the French-controlled Red River defense ring centered on Hanoi." However, the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on Gia Lam Airport on the outskirts of Hanoi was "chilling." The French aggressor troops, frightened by the explosions at Gia Lam Airport, "hurriedly took strict security measures in the city (Hanoi)," and especially "strengthened the sentry posts" around Cat Bi Airport near Haiphong, where American air force personnel are stationed.

However, the French army's strengthened precautions were not able to stop the heroic Vietnamese People's Army from attacking the French army airfield near Haiphong. On the evening of the 6th, the Vietnamese People's Army attacked Cat Bi Airport. United Press International said, "These commandos bypassed armored vehicles and mobile sentries, as well as patrols by specially trained police dogs, crossed electric fences and barbed wire obstacles, and placed explosives on parked aircraft," and then lit the explosives. Despite the fact that French authorities' "strict censorship prohibited the disclosure of the extent of the losses," the Associated Press admitted that Cat Bi Airport was "badly damaged" by the Vietnamese People's Army.

At the beginning of the dispatch of American air force personnel to participate in the Indochina War, U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland, in order to conceal the seriousness of their participation in the war and alleviate American people's concerns about their safety, issued a statement on February 15th to disguise the situation, saying that the American air force personnel participating in the Indochina War were "neither in important war zones nor near important war zones," and that "they rarely or never face danger to their lives." The Vietnamese People's Army's attack on the French military airfield shattered Weyland's lies and boasts, causing panic among some American senators. According to United Press International, members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed "concern" over the news of the attack on Cat Bi Airport. Senator Walter F. George, a Democratic member of the committee, said that the American air force personnel stationed in Indochina "may be in great danger." Other senators were even more worried that the United States was being "dragged step by step" into the Indochina War.

Xinhua News Agency: American air force personnel dispatched by the U.S. government to participate in the Indochina War are currently distributed in French air bases along the coast of Vietnam.

According to the Associated Press, some American air force personnel are stationed at the French air base in Da Nang on the central coast of Vietnam. "Just a few miles from this base, you can see smoke and hear a low rumble." This American air force personnel team stationed in Da Nang, called the "Little America" team, as well as another team north of Da Nang, are commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Walter Miller, a "veteran American air force pilot and mechanic." The "second team" of American air force personnel is stationed in Tu Son, southeast of Haiphong in North Vietnam, and consists of 103 airmen and four officers.

The Associated Press also revealed that these American air force personnel arrived in Indochina "quickly" on February 3rd. They were originally stationed at three U.S. air bases in Asia—Tachikawa and Iwakuni air bases in Japan, and Clark Air Base near Manila in the Philippines.

    越南人民军袭击河内海防附近法空军基地
    炸毁法国侵略军的飞机七十八架
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社八日讯：越南人民军最近先后袭击法军河内附近的嘉林机场和海防附近的吉碑机场，总共炸毁法军飞机七十八架，使法军遭到严重的打击。
    三月四日，越南人民军袭击距河内仅数公里的法军嘉林机场，炸毁达科他式运输机十八架、汽油库一座、发电机两部。
    两天以后，越南人民军在三月六日晚上又袭击海防东南六公里的法军吉碑机场，完全摧毁停在机场上的六十架敌机，其中包括B—二十六型飞机三十八架、战斗轰炸机十架、运输机三架和侦察机九架。袭击时曾使大批炸弹和炮弹爆炸，爆炸声从七日晨一时一直继续到五点；炸弹和炮弹的爆炸也炸毁一些敌机。吉碑是法国在印度支那的三个最大的空军基地之一。敌人已经把这个飞机场加以扩建，使重型飞机可以降落；美国驾驶员与空军人员也驻在这个机场上。
    在四日和六日两天，越南人民军总共炸毁了法军飞机七十八架。这是越南人民军在一月三十一日对海防东南的涂山机场进行袭击、炸毁法军运输机五架之后，取得的一次重大的胜利。
    法军自去冬今春在越南西北部的莱州省和寮国北部遭到失败以后，就不得不在远离基地的如奠边府等一些孤立据点中困守。为供应这些被围困的孤立据点，敌人又不得不动用大批飞机来进行几百公里长的空运。嘉林和吉碑是敌人两个主要的空军基地，敌机从这里起飞运送供应品给越南西北部的奠边府以及寮国北部的其他孤立据点的被围困的法国军队。人民军这一次炸毁了七十八架敌机，使敌人在运输与供应问题上遭到了新的困难。
    【新华社九日讯】越南人民军接连突击河内近郊的和驻有美国空军人员的海防近郊的法军飞机场，使法国殖民者遭到重大损失，并引起美国参议员的忧虑。
    美联社报道越南人民军在四日凌晨袭击距离河内市区不远的嘉林机场的情况说，“他们在这个机场的主要跑道上一个飞机接着一个飞机地把装在容器里的高度炸药放在飞机的引擎之下”，造成了“大爆炸”。“警报声和嘉林爆炸声惊醒了整个河内城”。越南人民军对嘉林机场的突击，使受到美国加紧支援的法军空运力量遭到重大损失。河内法军司令部含糊地说：这次突击使得“数目不详”的飞机爆炸。但是，合众社透露，“被炸毁的飞机中许多都是最近从美国运到这里来的，为的是可以多运一些供应品和增援部队到奠边府去。”遭到这次损失之后，“（法军）当局表示担心这些飞机的被破坏会大大减少对奠边府、琅勃剌邦和芒塞的空运数量”。
    嘉林机场遭到袭击之后，立即引起了被派参加印度支那战争的驻在海防附近机场的美国空军人员的惊惶不安。合众社说，最初，“人们认为这些从日本飞来的美国人是安全的，因为海防是在以河内为中心的法国控制得很严的红河防圈以内”。但是，越南人民军对河内边缘嘉林机场的袭击，“令人心寒”。被嘉林机场的爆炸吓慌了的法国侵略军，“急忙在该城（河内）采取严格的保安措施”，并特别在驻有美国空军人员的海防附近的吉碑机场的周围“加强了哨岗”。
    但是，法军加强了的戒备，并没有能够阻挡英勇的越南人民军对海防近郊法军机场的袭击。六日晚上，越南人民军袭击了吉碑机场。合众社说，“这些突击队员们避闪开装甲车和流动哨以及专门训练的警犬的巡查，越过电网和铁丝网障碍物，对停放着的飞机安放了炸药”，然后把炸药点着。尽管法军当局“严格的新闻检查制度不准透露损失的情况”，美联社承认，吉碑机场被越南人民军“打得不好使用了”。
    在美国空军人员被派遣到印度支那之初，美国远东空军司令威兰为了掩盖他们参战的严重性和减缓美国人民对他们的安全的顾虑，曾在二月十五日发表声明掩饰说：参加印度支那战争的美国空军人员“既不在重要战区，也不在重要战区附近”，“他们很少有或者说没有生命危险”。越南人民军这次对法军机场的袭击，粉碎了威兰的谎话和吹嘘，引来了一部分美国参议员的惶恐。据合众社透露，美国参议院外交委员会的委员们对吉碑机场遭到袭击的消息表示“关怀”。该委员会民主党参议员华尔特·弗·乔治说：驻在印度支那的美国空军人员“可能陷于很大的危险之中”。其他参议员们更担心：美国正在“一步一步”地被拉入印度支那战争。
    【新华社讯】由美国政府派遣参加印度支那战争的美国空军人员，现正分布在越南沿海的法国空军基地。
    据美联社报道，美国空军人员有一部分驻扎在越南中部海岸的法国空军基地岘港。“距离这个基地只几英里的地方可以望见烟雾缭绕并听到低沉的隆隆（炮）声”。这支驻在岘港叫做“小美国”队的美国空军人员队伍以及岘港北边的另一支队伍，都是由“老资格的美国空军驾驶员兼修理员”华特尔·米勒中校负责指挥。美国空军人员“第二队”则驻在北越海防东南的涂山，由一百零三名空军和四名军官组成。
    美联社并透露，这些美国空军人员是在二月三日“迅速地”来到印度支那的。他们原先分驻在美国在亚洲的三个空军基地——在日本的立川和岩国空军基地以及在菲律宾的马尼拉附近的克拉克空军基地。
