    Baotou City Fully Prepares for Basic Construction

    This year, Baotou City's basic construction tasks have increased several times compared to last year. In order to prepare for and better serve the construction of the Baotou industrial base, in addition to the City Construction Committee actively carrying out surveying, mapping, drilling, and collecting various data for the planning of the new urban area, the Enterprise Administration Bureau will build and expand fifteen relatively large-scale local state-owned factories. After these factories are completed, they will, in the future, meet the needs for bricks, tiles, stones, oxygen, refractory bricks, hardware, and other materials in basic construction for a certain period.

    The Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Third Party Representative Conference in late December last year, explicitly listing basic construction as the central task for a considerable period to come. Over the past few months, all construction units, construction companies, and the entire staff of factories and enterprises directly serving basic construction in the city, inspired by the general line of the state during the transition period and the spirit of the Third Party Representative Conference resolutions, have been actively carrying out various preparatory work for basic construction. At present, the city's construction tasks have been uniformly assigned according to the nature of the project, the complexity of the structure, and the strength and capabilities of the construction units' technical forces. The Municipal Finance Committee and relevant departments have conducted detailed research on the allocation of labor and transportation forces, and a basic solution has been obtained. In order to achieve planned supply of building materials and to balance the production, supply, and sales of building materials in the city, the Municipal Finance Committee has convened relevant units several times to specifically study and resolve issues, overcoming the blindness in the material preparation work. In addition, requests for central allocation have been made, and the city is actively organizing the production of materials such as bricks, tiles, rubble, and crushed stone that need to be supplied in large quantities locally, in order to ensure timely supply after the start of construction.

    Preparatory work for the construction and expansion of the fifteen local state-owned factories is actively underway. The factories have begun preliminary site inspections, and are required to start construction as soon as possible. Factories serving this year's basic construction are actively purchasing machinery, surveying factory sites, and preparing for design. In order to strengthen the leadership of this year's basic construction and create conditions for undertaking larger-scale basic construction tasks in the future, the Mengsui Sub-bureau and the Municipal Party Committee have transferred a considerable number of outstanding cadres to strengthen and improve the basic construction leadership organizations, and strengthen the leadership of local state-owned factories.

    包头市全面进行基本建设准备工作
    今年包头市的基本建设任务，较去年增加了数倍。为了筹备和更好的服务于包头工业基地建设，今年除城市建设委员会积极进行勘察、测量、钻探和搜集各种资料进行新市区的规划外，企业管理局将新建和扩建十五项规模较大的地方国营工厂。这些工厂建成后，将在今后一定时期内，满足基本建设中砖、瓦、石头、氧气、耐火砖、五金等器材的需要。
    中共包头市委曾于去年十二月下旬，举行了第三次党代表会议，明确地把基本建设列为今后一个相当长的时期内的中心任务。几个月来，全市各建设单位，施工单位和直接为基本建设服务的各工厂、企业的全体职工，在国家过渡时期总路线和第三次党代表会议决议精神的鼓舞下，积极进行基本建设的各项准备工作。目前，全市的建筑任务，已根据工程性质、结构繁简和施工单位技术力量强弱，建筑能力大小，统一分配。关于劳动力和运输力量的调拨，市财委和各有关部门进行了详细研究，并获得基本解决。为了做到建筑器材的计划供应和做到本市建筑器材产供销的平衡，市财委曾数次召集各有关单位，具体研究解决，克服了备料工作中的盲目性。此外，需要中央调拨的已请求调拨，需要本市大量供应的砖、瓦、块石、碎石等器材，本市积极组织生产，以保证工程开工后的及时供应。
    十五项地方国营工厂新建和扩建的准备工作，已积极进行。各厂已开始进行厂址的初察工作，要求尽早开工。为今年基本建设服务的工厂，正在积极进行机器购置、勘测厂址，准备进行设计。为加强今年基本建设领导，创造今后担当更大规模基本建设任务的条件，蒙绥分局和市委抽调了相当数量的优秀干部，充实和健全了基本建设领导机构，加强了地方国营工厂的领导力量。　（白石河）
