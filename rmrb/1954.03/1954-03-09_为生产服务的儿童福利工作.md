    Child Welfare Work Serving Production
    Zhang Jiafen
    With the development of production endeavors, China's childcare work has seen new progress in recent years.

    In cities, various methods have been created to solve the problem of breastfeeding for female workers. For example, factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places generally have established nurseries. Mothers send their children to the nurseries when they go to work and take them home after work. Some factories have cleared out rooms to establish breastfeeding rooms, allowing female workers to send their children to the breastfeeding rooms for timely feeding. With the development of family work, many factories have also used the strength of family members to establish children's playgrounds or nurseries in dormitories. This solves the problem of childcare for older children, allowing female workers to focus on production and enabling male and female workers on night shifts to rest quietly.

    In factories with female workers or a large number of female workers, if the leadership can pay attention to solving the problem of childcare, they can promote the smooth completion or over-completion of production tasks by female workers. For example, in the first quarter of last year, female workers at Chengdu Yuhua Cotton Mill lost a total of 56 workdays due to childcare issues. If we calculate that each person watches four looms and each loom produces 30 yards of cloth per day, then 6,720 yards of cloth were lost in those 56 days. In June of the same year, the factory combined production reform with attention to nursery work. The absenteeism rate of female workers with children decreased by 95 percent, and the quality of the products remained at the top level, exceeding the task.

    The leadership of many factories also absorb the childcare workers from nurseries to participate in the factory's production competition movements. Nursery staff members sign contact agreements with mothers, guaranteeing to take good care of the children while also guaranteeing to increase production. This raises the production enthusiasm of female workers and strengthens the sense of responsibility of childcare workers. For example, all the childcare workers at the nursery of the Jin Sheng Textile Factory in Taiyuan signed contracts with the mothers during the competition: the childcare workers guaranteed to take good care of the children and prevent accidents; the mothers guaranteed not to give the children snacks and to be punctual for work, exceeding the production tasks. In the summary, 15 of the 28 mothers in Class C of the nursery exceeded their tasks; eight mothers in Class B won red flags, and three mothers were named factory production models.

    In addition, urban organizations and schools have also established kindergartens, nurseries, and small childcare rooms to solve the difficulties for female cadres who cannot bring their children to work. Some places have also established street and neighborhood childcare stations to solve the childcare problems for some female public employees and female workers. This has played a certain role in improving the work efficiency of female public employees. For example, Wang Huiqin, a female teacher at Yixianqiao Primary School in Nanjing, had difficulty managing her work because she had many children. Later, when her two children entered the childcare room, her work improved rapidly, and she was promoted to director of teaching affairs.

    The same is true in rural areas. Wherever the problem of children is solved and solved well, mothers can better participate in agricultural production. For example, after Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province (now named Guo Houqi, same below), used various methods to solve the care of about 18,000 children, more than 11,000 mothers (about 40 percent of the county's female labor force) participated in production. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many women need to participate in labor, and solving the childcare problem has become even more urgent. The mutual aid groups in four counties in Anhui Province greatly affected the production enthusiasm of women because no one was taking care of the children. After this problem was solved, a large number of women participated in production. For example, 160,000 women in the Anqing, Wuhu, and Fuyang special districts were put into production the year before last.

    However, solving the childcare problem must be based on the voluntary participation of farmers, and various methods must be adopted according to the local situation at the time to achieve good results. We can adopt the method of "relatives helping relatives, neighbors helping neighbors," or the form of "north and south houses, facing kang," because these methods are most popular among farmers. Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, used the above methods to solve the childcare problem for more than 14,500 children.

    With the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the work of "baby groups" in better mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives has become part of the division of labor in production organizations. Young and middle-aged women participate in field production, while elderly or pregnant women can take care of children at home. According to statistics from seven counties in the Wendeng Special District of Shandong Province, more than 2,800 "baby groups" were organized in 1952, and in 1953, 53 out of 83 agricultural production cooperatives had established "baby-holding groups."

    In many rural areas, as the childcare problem is gradually solved, mothers actively participate in production, so they can do timely farming, not violate the agricultural season, increase yields, and increase family income. For example, in Mengkeli Village, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, the entire village's 121 mothers with children learned production techniques and participated in thinning work by using voluntary entrustment and other methods to solve the childcare problem. During the spring plowing last year, 140 women learned to go to the fields to flatten the soil, and women maintained five winning red flags (out of a total of eleven in the village) in the two red flag competitions. Seventy or eighty women learned to hoe the ground, and more than twenty could hold the plow and plant seeds. Mengkeli Village's ability to implement new cultivation methods and achieve comprehensive high yields is inseparable from the active participation of women in production. As the men in the village said: "If you want a good harvest, you can't do without women; if other villages don't mobilize women, they can't compete with us."

    为生产服务的儿童福利工作
    张家芬
    随着生产事业的发展，我国儿童保育工作近年来有新的发展。
    在城市中，为了给女工们解决孩子的喂奶问题，各地创造了多种多样的办法。如天津、上海、青岛等地工厂，一般都设立了托儿所，母亲上工时把孩子送到托儿所来，下工时把孩子抱回家去；有的工厂腾出房子成立了哺乳室，使女工们能按时把孩子送到哺乳室来喂乳。随着家属工作的开展，许多工厂还运用家属的力量在宿舍中成立了儿童乐园或托儿所。这就解决了年龄较大的孩子的寄托问题，使女工们能安心生产，并使作夜班的男女工人也能够安静地休息。
    在有女工或女工多的工厂，领导方面如果能注意解决孩子的寄托问题，就能推动女工顺利完成或超额完成生产任务。如成都裕华纱厂在去年第一季度中女工因孩子问题而请假的工时共五十六天，如果以每人看四台布机，每台布机日产三十码布计算，五十六天中就少出六千七百二十码布。同年六月间，工厂结合生产改革，注意做好托儿所工作，有孩子的女工缺勤率减少了百分之九十五，并且产品的质量保持在甲级上，超额完成了任务。
    许多工厂的领导方面还吸收托儿所的保育人员参加工厂的生产竞赛运动。托儿所工作人员与母亲订立联系合同，一方面保证带好孩子，一方面保证提高生产。这就提高了女工们的生产热情，加强了保育员的工作责任心。如太原市晋生纺织厂托儿所全体保育员在竞赛中和母亲们订立了合同：保育员保证看好孩子，不出事故；母亲们保证不给孩子吃零食，保证按时出勤，超额完成生产任务。总结时，托儿所丙班二十八个母亲中就有十五个超额完成了任务；乙班有八个母亲夺取了红旗，三个母亲被评为全厂生产模范。
    此外，城市中的机关、学校，也举办保育院、托儿所、小型托儿室等，解决女干部工作时不能带孩子的困难。有些地方还举办了街道、里弄托儿站，解决某些女公教人员和女工的孩子寄托问题。这对提高女公教人员的工作效率起了一定的作用。如南京市逸仙桥小学女教师王惠琴，因孩子多工作忙不过来，后来两个孩子进了托儿间，她的工作进步很快，被提升为教导主任。
    在农村中同样如此，凡是孩子问题得到解决而且解决得好的地方，就能使有孩子的母亲更好地参加农业生产。如黑龙江省肇源县（现名郭后旗，下同）运用各种办法解决了约一万八千名孩子的照管问题以后，有一万一千多个母亲（约占全县妇女劳动力的百分之四十）参加了生产。随着互助合作运动的发展，许多妇女需要参加劳动，孩子照管问题的解决就更显得迫切了。安徽省四个县的互助组，因为孩子没有人照顾，大大影响了妇女的生产情绪。这个问题解决以后，大批妇女参加了生产，如安庆、芜湖、阜阳三个专区前年就有十六万妇女投入生产中。
    但是孩子寄托问题的解决，必须在农民自愿的基础上，根据当时当地的情况，采取多种多样的办法，才能收到良好效果。我们可以采取“亲帮亲，邻帮邻”的办法，也可以采取“南北屋，对面炕”的形式，因为这些办法最受农民欢迎。黑龙江省肇源县就是采用上述办法解决了一万四千五百余名孩子的寄托问题。
    随着农业互助合作组织的发展，在比较好的互助组和农业生产合作社里，娃娃组的工作，已成为生产组织中劳动分工的一部分。青壮年妇女参加田间生产，老年或孕妇可以在家照顾孩子。据山东省文登专区七个县的统计，一九五二年组织了二千八百多个娃娃组，到一九五三年在八十三个农业生产合作社里，就有五十三个社建立了抱娃娃组。
    农村中许多地区由于逐步地解决了孩子的照管问题，母亲们积极投入生产，因而能做到按时耕作，不违农时，提高了产量，增加了家庭收入。如黑龙江省肇源县孟克里村，由于运用自愿委托等办法解决了孩子寄托问题，全村一百二十一名有孩子的母亲，学习了生产技术，参加了间苗工作。去年春耕时，有一百四十名妇女学会下地打楂子，在两次红旗竞赛中妇女自始至终保持了五面优胜红旗（全村共有十一面）。有七、八十名妇女学会铲地，二十多名能扶犁点种。孟克里村之能够实行新耕作法，获得全面丰产，是和妇女们的积极参加生产分不开的。正如该村男人们所说的：“要想丰产，缺了妇女可不行；别的村要是不把妇女发动起来，那可赛不过我们。”
