Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 13th: "Voice of Vietnam" Radio published a commentary on Indian Prime Minister Nehru's proposal regarding the cessation of the Indochina War. The full text is as follows:

On February 22nd, Indian Prime Minister Nehru read out a proposal regarding the cessation of the Indochina War at a meeting of the Indian Parliament. This proposal has aroused widespread repercussions internationally.

The Indian government and Prime Minister Nehru have previously expressed their support for peace and have contributed to the Korean armistice. Now, Nehru is again calling for an end to the Indochina War. This new effort reflects the Indian people's love of peace and their opposition to imperialist wars of aggression.

Currently, the American imperialists are actively interfering in the Indochina war of aggression. They are not only stepping up the supply of weapons to the French aggressor troops, continuously dispatching many military delegations to Indochina to realize their conspiracy to seize direct command of the Indochina war, but also, in February, shamelessly sent many US Air Force personnel to directly slaughter the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. These shameless activities irrefutably prove that the American interventionists are deliberately carrying out and plotting to expand the Indochina war. It is obvious that they are not only directly infringing upon the independence of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, but also threatening the sovereignty of other countries in the Far East, just as the American imperialists are now actively plotting to turn Pakistan into military bases, thereby threatening the sovereignty of India and other countries.

As for the French colonialists, despite repeated disastrous defeats, and despite the resolute opposition of the French people and other people around the world, they are still colluding with the American interventionists to continue this hopeless and dirty war. French Prime Minister Laniel's statement on March 5th in the French National Assembly regarding the ceasefire in Vietnam exposed this sinister conspiracy: the French colonialists talk about peace in words, but in fact, they hope to continue their war of aggression.

The position of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is very clear. In response to an interview by Mr. Niger, the editor-in-chief of the Swedish newspaper "Expressen," on November 26, 1953, President Ho Chi Minh said: The war in Vietnam was imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French government. The Vietnamese people were forced to take up arms and fight heroically for seven or eight years to defend national independence and the freedom of peaceful life. Now, if the French colonialists continue their war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out their patriotic struggle to the final victory. However, if the French government has learned a lesson from more than seven years of war and is willing to negotiate to obtain a ceasefire and resolve the Vietnam issue, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to accept this French proposal.

In response to the question, "Is it currently possible to achieve a truce or ceasefire? On what basis?", President Ho Chi Minh said: The French government must cease hostilities, and then a ceasefire in Vietnam can be achieved. The basis for this ceasefire is: the French government must truly respect the independence of Vietnam.

Foreign Minister Hoang Minh Giam of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam reiterated this position of safeguarding independence and peace in a statement on March 9th protesting the US government's dispatch of air force personnel to expand intervention in the Indochina War.

The Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that the just war to safeguard independence and peace, which has won increasing support from the people of the world, will surely be victorious.

    评尼赫鲁关于停止印度支那战争的建议
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社北越十三日电：“越南之声”电台就印度总理尼赫鲁关于停止印度支那战争的建议发表了评论，全文如下：
    二月二十二日，印度总理尼赫鲁在印度国会会议上宣读了关于停止印度支那战争的建议。这个建议在国际引起了广泛的反响。
    印度政府和总理尼赫鲁过去曾经表示拥护和平，并对朝鲜停战有过贡献。现在，尼赫鲁又呼吁停止印度支那战争。这个新的努力反映了反对帝国主义侵略战争的印度人民对和平的热爱。
    目前，美帝国主义者在积极干预印度支那的侵略战争。他们不仅加紧对法国侵略军的武器供应，连续派遣许多军事代表团到印度支那来实现他们的取得印度支那战争的直接指挥权的阴谋，而且在二月份无耻地派来许多美国空军人员来直接屠杀越南、高棉和寮国人民。这些无耻的活动都确凿地证明了，美国干涉者在蓄意进行、并阴谋扩大印度支那战争。显而易见，他们不仅直接侵犯了越南、高棉、寮国三国人民的独立，而且威胁着远东其他国家，正如美帝国主义者现在正在积极策划把巴基斯坦变成军事基地，从而威胁着印度和其他国家的主权一样。
    至于法国殖民者，尽管连续遭到惨败，尽管法国人民和世界其他地方人民的坚决反对，他们仍然与美国干涉者串通一气来继续这场毫无希望的肮脏战争。法国总理拉尼埃三月五日在法国国民议会就越南停战发表的声明暴露了这个罪恶的阴谋：法国殖民者口头谈着和平，事实上却希望进行他们的侵略战争。
    越南民主共和国人民和政府的立场是十分清楚的。胡志明主席一九五三年十一月二十六日在答复瑞典报纸“快报”主编尼哥时说：越南战争是法国政府强加于越南人民身上的。越南人民是被迫拿起武器，为保卫民族独立与和平生活的自由而英勇奋斗了七八年。现在假如法国殖民主义者继续其侵略越南的战争，越南人民是有决心将自己的爱国斗争进行到最后胜利的。但是，假如法国政府因七年多的战争已得到教训，愿意经过谈判，获得停战，并解决越南问题，越南民主共和国的人民和政府是愿意接受法国这项建议的。
    在回答“目前是否有可能实现休战或停战？在什么基础之上？”这个问题时，胡志明主席说：法国政府必须停止敌对行为，然后越南停战便可实现。这种停战的基础就是：法国政府真正尊重越南的独立。
    越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴三月九日在抗议美国政府派遣空军人员扩大干涉印度支那战争的声明中重申了这种维护独立与和平的立场。
    越南人民深信，赢得了世界人民越来越大的支持的维护独立与和平的正义战争是一定会取得胜利的。
