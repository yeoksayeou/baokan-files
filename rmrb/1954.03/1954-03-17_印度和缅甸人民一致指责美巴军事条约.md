   Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 14th: Muslims in various parts of India are opposing American conspiracies and condemning the US-Pakistan military treaty as a threat to peace in Asia and the world.

    Following a meeting of Muslims in Lucknow on the 7th to condemn US military "aid" to Pakistan, Muslims in Bombay also held a meeting on the 8th. The meeting denounced the US-Pakistan military treaty, saying that the treaty would mean the destruction of Pakistan.

    In Madras Province, Raga Khan, a Muslim League member of the Madras Provincial Legislative Assembly, said in a speech to the Legislative Assembly that concluding a military treaty with the United States would not benefit Pakistan in the slightest.

    Maulana Hafzur Rehman, a member of the Indian Parliament and a prominent Indian Muslim leader, said recently in an interview with a reporter from the Delhi Muslim newspaper "Indian Herald" that the United States and its allies want to turn Asians into cannon fodder. US military "aid" to Pakistan is an open provocation to Asia. This is the United States' attempt to expand its rule over Asian countries. Referring to the US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson's statement that the United States should rule Asia indefinitely, Hafzur Rehman said that military "aid" to Pakistan is the first step in that direction. He said that the aggressive intent of the United States in providing such "aid" is very clear.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: According to the Indian News Service: A mass meeting was held in Calcutta on the 11th. A resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting stated that the military treaty between the United States and Pakistan would strengthen imperialism's colonialism in Asia and the Middle East. The resolution stated that due to US military "aid" to Pakistan, it is inappropriate for US "military observers" to remain in Kashmir. The resolution demanded the immediate removal of US "observers" from the United Nations observer group in Kashmir.

    Lalewala, leader of the National Front of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, also condemned US military "aid" to Pakistan at a mass meeting near Patiala on the 11th. He said that the situation created by this "aid" requires better national unity in India.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Rangoon dispatch: The Executive Committee of the Rangoon Branch of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a meeting on the 6th and unanimously resolved to protest the US-Pakistan military treaty to the US Ambassador to Burma. The protest letter stated that the US-Pakistan military treaty and the United States' current active aggression in Southeast Asia are undoubtedly a serious threat to Burma.

    Burmese public opinion continues to criticize US military "aid" to Pakistan. The Burmese newspaper "People's Daily" in Mandalay recently wrote: "Pakistan's actions have brought new dangers to peace-loving people all over the world. Asian newspapers have pointed this out, and we cannot but express our views because we are only a wall away from Pakistan." The newspaper said that the United States must be responsible for the current situation. "What the United States is doing in international politics now is completely passing off its own will as the will of the Asian people."

    印度和缅甸人民一致指责美巴军事条约
   【新华社新德里十四日电】印度各地的回教徒纷纷反对美国在亚洲的阴谋，指责美巴军事条约威胁亚洲和世界和平。
    继勒克瑙的回教徒在七日举行大会谴责美国给巴基斯坦军事“援助”之后，孟买的回教徒也在八日举行大会。大会指斥美巴军事条约，说这个条约将意味着巴基斯坦的毁灭。
    在马德拉斯省，马德拉斯省立法院的回教联盟议员拉加·康恩在立法院演说时说，与美国缔结军事条约，一点也不会使巴基斯坦得到利益。
    印度国会议员、著名的印度回教领袖毛拉纳·哈弗朱尔·雷赫曼最近在接见德里回教报纸“印度文汇报”记者时说，美国和它的盟友想把亚洲人变成战争炮灰。美国给予巴基斯坦的军事“援助”是对亚洲的公开挑衅。这是美国想扩大对亚洲国家的统治。谈到美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊所说的美国应该无限期地统治亚洲，哈弗朱尔·雷赫曼说，给予巴基斯坦的军事“援助”是朝这个方向走的第一步。他说，美国给予这种“援助”的侵略意图是很明显的。
    【新华社十三日讯】据印度新闻处报道：加尔各答在十一日举行群众大会。大会一致通过的一项决议说，美国与巴基斯坦之间的军事条约将会加强帝国主义在亚洲和中东的殖民主义。决议认为：由于美国对巴基斯坦进行的军事“援助”，美国“军事观察员”继续留在克什米尔是不适当的。决议要求立即撤除在克什米尔的联合国观察小组中的美国“观察员”。
    巴地阿拉与东旁遮普土邦联盟民族阵线领袖拉雷瓦拉，十一日也在巴地阿拉附近的群众大会上谴责美国对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”。他说：这种“援助”造成的局势要求印度全国更好的团结。
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会仰光分会执行委员会六日举行会议，一致决议向美国驻缅甸大使抗议美巴军事条约。抗议书上说，美巴军事条约和美国目前积极进行的侵略东南亚的活动，毫无疑问是对缅甸的一个严重的威胁。
    缅甸舆论也在继续抨击美国给巴基斯坦军事“援助”。曼德勒的缅甸文报“人民报”最近写道：“巴基斯坦的行动已给全世界各地爱好和平的人民带来了新的危险。亚洲各报都已指出这一点，我们不能不表明我们的看法，因为我们与巴基斯坦只有一墙之隔。”该报说，美国必须要对目前的情形负责。“美国现在在国际政治中的所作所为，完全是把它自己的意志冒称是亚洲人民的意志。”
