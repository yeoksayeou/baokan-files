Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

The 慰问 activities of the Direct Sub-General Delegation of the National People's 慰问 Delegation to the People's Liberation Army, to the various organs and schools of the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the leading organs of the various branches of the People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Beijing, have been successfully concluded.

The 慰问 activities of the Direct Sub-General Delegation lasted for 24 days, from February 21st to March 16th. At many 慰问 rallies, the representatives met with a large number of People's Liberation Army commanders, fighters, political workers, logistics workers, and wounded and sick personnel, conveying the people's love and expectations for their own soldiers. The representatives also went to the mountainous areas on both sides of the Yongding River, far from the urban area of Beijing, to extend 慰问 to the engineering troops who were building the Fengtai-Shacheng section of the railway. The representatives held sincere discussions and get-togethers with many cadres and soldiers, and visited the troops' dormitories, canteens, drill grounds, classrooms, and various exercises and performances of the troops. The Direct Sub-General Delegation also specially organized 20 report meetings to report to the troops on the general line of the country during the transition period and the achievements of the capital's construction over the past few years. Sixteen theatrical troupes, quyi acrobatics troupes, and film projection teams enthusiastically performed extensive 慰问 performances for the People's Liberation Army cadres, soldiers, and wounded and sick personnel in the troops, schools, and hospitals.

The noble qualities, skilled military techniques, and excellent equipment of the People's Liberation Army cadres and soldiers left an extremely deep impression on the representatives. The representatives expressed that they must convey to the broad masses of the people the deeds of the People's Liberation Army in loving the motherland and struggling arduously. The enthusiastic 慰问 of the 慰问 Delegation greatly inspired the will of the People's Liberation Army cadres and soldiers to defend peace and defend the socialist construction cause of the motherland. Responding to Chairman Mao and the care of the people of the whole country with practical actions has become a resounding slogan in the troops. Cadres and soldiers have written letters of thanks to the 慰问 Delegation and Chairman Mao, expressing that they will definitely, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, strive to strengthen military, political, and cultural learning, work actively, and strive to strengthen national defense and build a modernized and regularized national defense army.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Representatives of the Ninth Sub-Delegation of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation of the National People's 慰问 Delegation to the People's Liberation Army recently braved the severe cold to extend 慰问 to the heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers who are working hard day and night to guard the primeval forests of Northeast China.

The 慰问 Delegation held a 慰问 rally in the deep mountains. Cui Cai, Deputy Head of the Ninth Sub-Delegation, reported to the soldiers on the Party's general line during the transition period and the great achievements of the motherland's construction in various aspects over the past four years, presented gifts to the soldiers, and pinned 慰问 commemorative badges on the chests of the troops' commanders. The 慰问 Delegation's cultural troupe performed many literary and artistic programs for the soldiers. The film projection team screened films such as "National Day of 1953" for the soldiers. The soldiers here had not seen a movie for more than a year. When they saw Chairman Mao appear on Tiananmen Square on the screen, they applauded enthusiastically for a long time and cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The 慰问 Delegation representatives and troops' cadres, meritorious personnel, and model workers also held forums and interviews. Li Jinfu, a model worker from Jilin Province's industry, and others reported to the soldiers on their model deeds and the situation of the people of the motherland doing a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Jin Dezhou, a second-class meritorious serviceman of the troops, and others reported to the representatives on their heroic deeds in overcoming difficulties and protecting the security of the motherland and the wealth of the motherland in the primeval forest.
