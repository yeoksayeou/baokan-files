    Volunteer Army Units Actively Help Korean People Prepare for Spring Plowing
    Units Plan to Reclaim Wasteland to Grow Vegetables

    [Xinhua News Agency] The first spring plowing season after the Korean armistice is approaching, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army units are actively helping the Korean people prepare for spring production. In the Shangganling area, a unit of the Volunteer Army is not only filling in bomb craters in the fields to expand arable land but also helping Korean people build irrigation canals. A unit of the Volunteer Army on the western front will allocate a large number of laborers to fill in more than 11,000 bomb craters in the stationed area, and is also preparing to help local residents repair waterlogged land and dams and reservoirs destroyed by enemy aircraft. After the completion of these projects, the cultivated area can be expanded by more than 800 mu. A unit will assist people returning to their homes in building 14 irrigation canals, with a total length of about 6,000 meters. The Fourth Company of a Volunteer Army unit on the Pingkang front returned the large training ground they had built by filling bomb craters to the Korean people returning to their homes for spring plowing.

    Volunteer Army units are learning from the local people about the amount of labor and production tools they need for spring plowing production, so as to provide help in a planned and organized manner. A unit of the Volunteer Army on the central front adopted a system of division of responsibility, assigning specific tasks to its subordinate units, so that every county, village, and every household lacking labor within the stationed area has a designated unit specifically responsible for helping solve production difficulties. Many units have begun to help the people in their stationed areas deliver manure and repair agricultural implements. Zhong Xianquan, the squad leader of a Volunteer Army unit on the east coast who was awarded the title of "People-Loving Meritorious Person" by the Jiangyuan-do government, and all the soldiers in his squad have helped the people in their stationed area deliver more than 1,000 jin of fertilizer.

    In order to cooperate with the spring plowing of the Korean people, a Volunteer Army unit on the Pingkang front also cooperated with the local government to hold a "Chinese Agricultural Production Photo Exhibition." The Korean farmers who visited the exhibition were greatly encouraged and educated, and they are determined to cultivate the land deeply and carefully to increase grain production for the motherland.

    [Xinhua News Agency] The commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are currently actively preparing to grow their own vegetables to ensure that the troops can get enough vegetables.

    The weather in Korea is gradually warming up. After consulting with the local Korean government, the Volunteer Army units will reclaim wasteland near their stationed areas and prepare to grow 80 jin of vegetables per person this year. The soldiers guarding the western front are planning to cultivate the land near the positions, which is full of bomb craters, to turn these wastelands near the positions into neat and lush vegetable fields. Many units have also established vegetable growing mutual aid groups or vegetable growing research groups, and some units have also learned vegetable growing methods from the Korean people in their stationed areas. A unit of the Volunteer Army on the central front has sent people to the Xipu Farm in Jiangyuan South Road to learn how to grow vegetables in the Korean soil.

    The soldiers of each unit are also collecting scrap iron and making their own vegetable growing tools. The Third Company of a Volunteer Army unit on the eastern front has collected more than 2,000 jin of scrap iron to supply the unit's blacksmith shop to make hoes and rakes. The soldiers of an engineer company of a Volunteer Army unit on the east coast have collected various scrap iron from mountain gullies and roadsides and are making shovels and hoes. A blacksmith shop of a unit has manufactured more than 140 implements in a short period of time.

    Volunteer Army units have begun to turn over and dry various kinds of manure in preparation for vegetable growing fertilizer. A certain battalion paid attention to using urine storage ponds, garbage dumps, and manure piles to accumulate fertilizer last winter, and by February this year, it had accumulated about 65,000 jin of fertilizer. A Volunteer Army unit on the eastern front has accumulated about one million jin of dried manure.

    志愿军各部队积极帮助朝鲜人民准备春耕
    各部队指战员计划开垦荒地自种青菜
    【新华社讯】朝鲜停战后的第一个春耕季节快要来到了，中国人民志愿军各部队正积极帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕生产的准备工作。上甘岭地区的志愿军某部除正在填平田野里的弹坑以扩大耕地面积外，还帮助朝鲜人民修建水渠。西线志愿军某部将抽调大批劳动力，填平驻区内的一万一千多个弹坑，并准备帮助当地居民修整涝地和被敌机炸毁的水坝、蓄水沟等。这些工程完成后可扩大耕种面积八百多亩。某部将要协助重返家园的人民修建十四条水渠，全长约六千公尺。平康前线志愿军某部四连将自己填平弹坑修建起来的大操场归还给重返家园的朝鲜人民进行春耕。
    志愿军各部队正向当地人民了解他们在春耕生产中所需要的劳动力和生产工具的数量，以便有计划、有组织地进行帮助。中线志愿军某部采取分区负责制的办法，责成所属各部具体分工，以便驻地范围内每一个郡、里和每一个缺乏劳动力的农户，都有指定的单位专门负责帮助解决生产中的困难。许多部队已开始帮助驻地人民送粪和整修农具。东海岸志愿军某部荣获江原道政府授予“爱民功臣”称号的班长钟先全和全班战士已帮助驻地人民送了一千多斤肥料。
    为了配合朝鲜人民的春耕，平康前线志愿军某部还协同当地政府举办了“中国农业生产图片展览会”，参观过这个展览会的朝鲜农民受到了很大的鼓舞和教育，他们决心深耕细作为祖国增产更多的粮食。
    【新华社讯】中国人民志愿军的指挥员战斗员们目前正积极准备自种蔬菜，以保证部队能充分地吃到青菜。
    现在朝鲜天气正逐渐转暖。志愿军各部队在商得当地朝鲜政府的同意后，将要开垦驻地附近的荒地，准备全军今年每人自种青菜八十斤。守卫在西部前线的战士们正在计划翻耕阵地附近弹坑累累的土地，使这些靠近阵地的荒地变成整齐鲜绿的菜田。许多部队还成立了种菜互助组或种菜研究小组，有些部队还向驻地朝鲜人民学习种菜方法。中部前线志愿军某部已抽调专人到江原南道洗浦农场学习在朝鲜的土壤上应怎样种菜。
    各部队的战士们还正在搜集废铁，自制种菜用具。东部前线志愿军某部三连已搜集废铁二千多斤，供给该部铁匠炉制造锄头和钉耙。东海岸志愿军某部工兵连的战士们从山沟里和公路旁拾回各种废铁，正在制造铁锹和锄头。某部一个铁匠炉在短期内已制造了一百四十多件用具。
    志愿军各部已开始翻晒各种粪肥，积极地准备种菜用的肥料。某营在去年冬天就注意利用蓄尿池、垃圾堆和粪堆积肥，到今年二月已积有约六万五千多斤肥料。东部前线志愿军某部已积下晒干的粪肥约百万斤。
