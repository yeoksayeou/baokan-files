    [This Newspaper Dispatch] The CCP Central South Directly Subordinate Organs Committee has, according to instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the Central South Bureau, arranged for cadres of its subordinate organs to study documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CCP. Li Xiannian, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Central Committee Central South Bureau, delivered a report on March 15 to senior cadres of the Central South Directly Subordinate Organs and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, conveying and explaining the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

    This study requires Party member cadres at the level of Director of Central South First-Level Bureaus and above to deeply research the main documents of the Fourth Plenary Session and earnestly conduct discussions. At the same time, they should relate the spirit of the documents to their own thinking and work, particularly conducting examinations regarding issues related to Party unity and collective leadership. For Party member cadres below the level of Bureau Director, the main requirement is to study the prescribed study documents well. On the basis of understanding the spirit of the documents, they can appropriately relate them to their own thinking and work, consciously conduct some self-examination and self-criticism, thereby improving understanding through study and achieving the goal of further strengthening Party unity.

    To help cadres understand the documents and deepen the effect of study, during the study period, the directly subordinate organs will organize a report on the study of the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session in each system.

    Currently, all units of the directly subordinate organs have begun studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session on the basis of deeply studying the General Line and combining it with the examination and summarization of work. The study time is set: advanced group and middle and junior group cadres for theoretical study are to complete it before April 15th and April 10th respectively.

    In order to check the effectiveness of this study, it is also stipulated that after the study, units above the Central South First-Level Bureaus must write reports on the study and examination of senior cadres, and the branch party committees must write a summary report on the study of all cadres in their system.

    Furthermore, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CCP has decided that on the basis of the city's cadres studying the General Line and examining and summarizing work, from March 15th to April 15th, they will further study the documents of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session of the Party.

    From March 15th, Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CCP, and Zhang Pinghua, Second Secretary, have respectively delivered reports on the resolution of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session to senior Party cadres and Party member cadres above the section chief level throughout the city. The aim is that through this study, all Party cadres, especially senior Party cadres, will further understand the great achievements of the entire Party in various tasks under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao since the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and understand the correctness of the Party Central Committee's political line and organizational line during this period, so as to strengthen the Party's organization and discipline, strengthen the Party's unity and the Party's collective leadership, and oppose decentralism, individualism, and complacency. It is required that Party member responsible cadres of municipal-level departments, commissions, bureaus, and district (party) committees conduct serious discussions on the various documents and transmission reports of the Seventh Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, and carry out criticism and self-criticism in the discussions, examining their own shortcomings in leadership, especially regarding the examination of issues related to Party unity and the system of collective leadership. Party member cadres above the section chief level are required to conduct necessary discussions on the basis of studying the documents, and appropriately relate them to their own thinking and work. For general Party member cadres, they are required to carefully read the documents, understand the principle of the Party's collective leadership and unified leadership, and the importance of strengthening the Party's leadership for realizing the General Line. Non-Party cadres will study together with general Party member cadres on a voluntary basis.

    Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Directly Subordinate Organs Party Committee, the Trade and Cooperation Party Committee, the Jiang'an District Committee and other units have convened conferences of all Party members and Party member cadres, and the responsible comrades of the Party Committee have conveyed and deployed the tasks level by level. The Trade and Cooperation Party Committee also drew up a plan, assigning eight reporters to prepare reports on Party unity and collective leadership issues for non-Party cadres to help them study.

    为了帮助干部理解文件以加深学习效果，在学习期间，准备由直属机关各个系统分别组织一次关于学习七届四中全会文件的报告。
    目前，直属机关各单位都已在深入学习总路线并结合检查总结工作的基础上，开始了四中全会文件的学习。学习时间规定：理论学习高级组和中、初级组干部，分别至四月十五日和四月十日以前结束。

    从三月十五日起，中共武汉市委第一书记王任重同志、第二书记张平化同志已分别向全市党的高级干部和科长以上的党员干部作了关于七届四中全会决议的传达报告。要求通过这次学习，使全党干部、特别是党的高级干部进一步了解自党的七届三中全会以来，全党在党中央和毛主席领导下，在各项工作中的伟大成就，了解在此期间，党中央的政治路线和组织路线的正确性，以加强党的组织性、纪律性，加强党的团结和党的集体领导，反对分散主义、个人主义和骄傲情绪。要求市级各部、委、局和区（党）委的党员负责干部，对中共七届四中全会的各项文件和传达报告，进行认真的讨论，并在讨论中开展批评与自我批评，联系自己在领导方面的缺点加以检讨，特别是对于有关党的团结和有关集体领导制度的检查。要求科长以上的党员干部在学习文件的基础上，进行必要的讨论，适当联系到自己的思想和工作。对于一般党员干部，则要求认真阅读文件，领会党的集体领导与统一领导的原则和加强党的领导对于实现总路线的重要意义。非党干部则在自愿的原则下与一般党员干部一道学习。
