    Tao Yuming, a maintenance worker in the spinning workshop of the private Minfeng Yarn Factory in Changzhou, successfully modified old spinning frames, increasing cotton yarn production by 912 pieces per year, worth more than 6.78 billion yuan.
    The Minfeng Yarn Factory has a total of eighteen spinning frames, which were purchased more than thirty years ago. The style is very old. There were many yarn breakages and defective yarns during production, which limited the speed of the spindles and caused uneven twist in the spun yarn, seriously affecting the output and quality of the cotton yarn.
    Tao Yuming, a technician in the maintenance workshop, saw that the old spinning frames were seriously affecting production. As early as 1952, when the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched, he suggested modifying the spindles, but some people thought it was not certain to succeed, so they did not take action. Later, Tao Yuming further studied the problems of the machine and redesigned a style that did not require changing the spindles. Last spring, the trade union supported his proposal, and after obtaining the consent of the capitalist, he started the modification. After more than a month of efforts, the modification was finally successful. From the second half of last year to now, fifteen spinning frames have been successively modified. By March of this year, all eighteen frames will be successfully modified.
    The modified spinning frame overcomes many of the problems of the original machine. For example, when the original spindle was running at 200 revolutions, there were 300 end breaks per hour per thousand spindles. Now, the spindle speed has been increased to 232 revolutions, and the end breakage rate is maintained at about 160, which reduces the labor intensity of female workers and facilitates the implementation of the Hao Jianxiu work method. As a result, the roller lap has been reduced from 1.098 percent in the past to 0.593 percent, and there are very few defective yarns. The spindle production has increased from 1.15 pounds to 1.32 pounds. The eighteen frames can increase cotton yarn production by 912 pieces per year, which is of great importance to ensuring the completion of the factory's production plan.

    常州市私营民丰纱厂保全工人陶玉明
    改装旧细纱机一年增产六十多亿元
    常州市私营民丰纱厂细纱间保全工人陶玉明，改装旧式细纱机成功，一年可增产棉纱九百十二件，共值六十七亿八千多万元。
    民丰纱厂共有十八台细纱机，是三十多年前购置的，式样很旧，生产时断头多，坏纱多，因而限制了车头的转速，并使纺出的纱捻度不匀，严重影响了棉纱的产量和质量。
    保全间技工陶玉明看到旧细纱机严重影响生产，早在一九五二年开展增产节约运动时，他就建议要改掉车头，但有些人认为没有把握，因此不曾动手。后来陶玉明又进一步研究机器的毛病，重新设计了一种式样，不需要再改动车头。去年春天，工会支持了他的建议，在取得资方的同意后，就动手改装，经过一个多月的努力，终于改装成功。从去年下半年到现在，已陆续改装了十五台细纱车。到今年三月间，十八台车就将全部改装成功。
    经过改装的细纱机，克服了原有机器的很多毛病。如原来车头开到二百转，每小时每千锭有三百个断头，现在，车头速度加快到二百三十二转，断头率保持在一百六十个左右，这样就减轻了女工的劳动强度，便利了郝建秀工作法的执行。因此，皮辊花已从过去的百分之一·○九八减少到百分之○·五九三，坏纱很少了；锭扯产量已从一·一五磅增加到一·三二磅，十八台车一年可增产棉纱九百十二件，对保证完成全厂生产计划有很大作用。
