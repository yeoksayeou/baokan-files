In order to help tea farmers improve tea planting techniques and increase the yield and quality of tea, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Xikang Provincial People's Government recently held a tea farmer training class. In the past, tea farmers in the province used old farming methods, and the survival rate and yield of tea trees were very low. After this study, tea farmer representatives understood advanced farming techniques such as selecting seeds with clean water, soaking seeds in salt water, deep plowing and shallow sowing, uniform row spacing, and reasonable fertilization. In particular, after the tea farmer representatives visited the Ya'an Tea Experiment Farm and saw the tea plantations cultivated using advanced farming methods, their confidence in increasing production this year was boosted. They all said: We will definitely promote it well to the tea farmers when we go back and lead them to improve their techniques to increase the yield and quality of tea.

Furthermore, in order to produce more tea this year, the farmers of Tongxin Village, Shizhen Township, Yingjing County, Xikang Province, actively cleared the tea gardens and weeded the wild grass in the tea gardens as early as last winter. At present, more than 80 percent of the tea gardens in the village have been weeded once, and some farmers have also fertilized the tea trees once. In the past, the farmers in this village did not have the habit of fertilizing tea trees. Last spring, Deputy Township Chief Li Shaolin fertilized his tea garden once, and not only did the tea trees grow very strong, but the tea leaves also grew densely and thickly, and he picked two crops of tea. Li Shaolin's increased production facts educated the farmers, so this year many farmers in the village fertilized the tea trees and paid attention to improving the management of the tea gardens.

    西康省举办茶农训练班
    为了帮助茶农改进种茶技术，提高茶叶的产量和质量，西康省人民政府农林厅最近举办了茶农训练班。过去该省茶农沿用旧的耕作方法，茶树的成活率和产量都很低。经过这次学习，茶农代表们懂得了用清水选种、盐水浸种、深耕浅播、行株均匀、合理施肥等先进耕作技术。特别是茶农代表参观了雅安茶叶试验场采用先进耕作方法培植的茶园后，对今年增产的信心提高了。都表示：回去一定好好地向茶农宣传，带动他们改进技术提高茶叶的产量和质量。
    又讯：西康省荥经县石滓乡同心村农民为了今年增产更多的茶叶，早在去年冬季就积极清理茶园，薅除茶园里的野草，目前全村百分之八十以上的茶园，都薅了一次草，有些农民还给茶树施了一次肥。过去该村农民没有给茶树施肥的习惯，去年春天，副乡长李绍霖的茶园上了一次肥，不仅茶树长得很壮，而且茶叶长得又密又厚实，连摘了两道茶。李绍霖的增产事实教育了农民，所以今年该村不少的农民给茶树施了肥，并注意改进茶园的经营管理。
