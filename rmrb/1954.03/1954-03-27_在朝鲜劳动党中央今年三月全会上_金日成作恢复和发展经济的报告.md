Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 26th: The "Rodong Sinmun," "Democratic Korea," and other newspapers in Pyongyang published on the 25th the report made by Kim Il Sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held from March 21st to 23rd, 1954. The title of the report is: On the various shortcomings in the industrial and transportation sectors, and the current tasks of the Party, state, and economic organs and their staff to correct these shortcomings.

In his report, Kim Il Sung first pointed out the great achievements made by the Korean people in the short months after the armistice with the fraternal support of the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. He said: During this period, our party and government mainly carried out preparations for the comprehensive restoration of the people's economy that is about to begin.

Kim Il Sung listed the various measures taken by the Korean Workers' Party and the government after the armistice, saying: In order to stabilize the lives of the people who lived in caves and air-raid shelters during the war, and to ensure their temporary housing, we secured farmland for the farmers in order to quickly restore the damaged rural areas, allowing farmers who had been displaced and scattered during the war to return to their hometowns and make a living, and we solved their problems with grain, livestock, farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. We quickly restored factories and manufacturing plants that could start production, and put them into operation. We ensured the normal restoration of railway transportation. We carried out the design work and all preparations for the comprehensive restoration of the people's economy. We moved the equipment that had been evacuated and dispersed back to the factories and manufacturing plants; we reorganized the damaged factories and enterprises; we concentrated materials and raw materials in the factories and enterprises. As the most important preparation for the comprehensive restoration and construction, we established brick-making, tile-making factories, and building materials factories in various places. We prepared and trained a large number of technical personnel and technicians necessary for the restoration and construction.

Kim Il Sung said: Our entire people enthusiastically support the policies of the Party and the government. In cities and villages, in industrial and transportation organizations, they are working together to restore the people's economy after the war. Thus, in just a few months after the armistice, tens of thousands of temporary houses have been built in our cities and villages; farmers who had been evacuated to remote mountainous areas have begun to rebuild their hometowns; market prices have fallen, and the people's lives are gradually stabilizing; and the damaged cities, factories, and manufacturing plants are being restored from the ruins; many enterprises will soon start full production.

Kim Il Sung then pointed out: However, this is only the starting point for carrying out the arduous task of restoring and developing the postwar people's economy. The more difficult tasks facing us are: to restore and rebuild the cities and villages that have been turned into ruins, as well as factories, enterprises, railways, ports, roads, bridges, and educational, cultural, and health facilities. These tasks have been clearly pointed out in the draft of the 1954-1956 People's Economic Plan. This draft was formulated in accordance with the basic principles of the Three-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the People's Economy after the War, which was stipulated at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party held shortly after the armistice, and will soon be submitted to the Supreme People's Assembly for discussion and approval.

Regarding the draft of the Three-Year People's Economic Plan for 1954-1956, Kim Il Sung said: By the last year of the three-year plan, 1956, our industry will reach approximately 153 percent compared to 1949 before the war, of which heavy industry will reach 120 percent, light industry will reach 137 percent, and the chemical building materials industry will reach 90 percent. Almost all sectors of the people's economy will reach or exceed pre-war levels. The damaged large factories, enterprises, mines, and coal mines will be fully restored and expanded, and many new modern factories will be built and put into production.

Kim Il Sung pointed out that the Korean people are fully capable of realizing this huge plan for restoring and developing the postwar people's economy. He said: We have the great economic and technical assistance of the people of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, rich natural resources, and the rich experience and people's power tempered in the five years of peaceful restoration and construction and the three years of arduous Fatherland Liberation War. Kim Il Sung then pointed out some shortcomings in the restoration and construction work, and successively talked about the issue of improving the leadership level of the provinces and bureaus of the industrial sector, the issue of selecting and allocating economic and technical personnel, the issue of labor organization and labor force, the issue of accumulating funds and reducing costs, the issue of ensuring the realization of the plan, the issue of basic construction and design, the issue of improving production and culture, and the issue of strengthening the Party's leadership over the industrial sector; and pointed out the current tasks of the Party, state, and economic organs and their staff to correct the shortcomings.

Kim Il Sung said at the end of the report: As long as our Party organs, Party organizations, all Party members, and all the people are more firmly united around our Party Central Committee and the Republic government, correct all bad tendencies, and launch unremitting struggle with infinite loyalty to the Party and the motherland in order to complete the glorious tasks facing the Party, overcome the various shortcomings existing in the industrial sector in the shortest possible time, fundamentally improve the leadership of all economic sectors and raise it to the level of political tasks, then we will surely successfully complete the arduous and glorious task of restoring and building the postwar people's economy facing our Party, our country, and our people, and restore and build our country to be more beautiful and prosperous.

    在朝鲜劳动党中央今年三月全会上
    金日成作恢复和发展经济的报告
   【新华社平壤二十六日电】平壤的“劳动新闻”、“民主朝鲜报”及其他各报在二十五日发表了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会委员长金日成在二十一日—二十三日举行的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会一九五四年三月全体会议上所作的报告。该报告的题目是：关于在产业、运输部门中的各种缺点，和为了纠正这些缺点，党、国家和经济机关及其工作人员的当前任务。
    金日成在报告中首先指出在停战后的短短几个月期间，朝鲜人民在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家人民兄弟般的支援下所取得的巨大成就。他说：在这段时期内，我们党和政府主要是为即将着手全面恢复人民经济进行了准备工作。
    金日成列举朝鲜劳动党和政府在停战以后所采取的各种措施说：我们为了安定在战时住在窑洞和防空壕里的人民的生活，保障了他们的临时住宅。为了迅速地恢复被破坏的农村，使在战时背井离乡分散到各处的农民重新回到自己的家乡，并得以维持生计，我们保障了农民的耕地，并给他们解决了粮食、畜力、农具、种籽、肥料等问题。我们迅速地恢复了能够开工生产的工厂、制造所，使之开工生产。我们保障了铁道运输的正常恢复。我们进行了全面恢复人民经济的设计工作和一切准备工作。我们把曾经疏散和分散的设备搬回工厂、制造所去；整理了被破坏的工厂、企业；集中了资材和原料到工厂、企业中去。作为全面恢复建设事业最重要的准备工作，我们在各地建立了制砖、制瓦工厂和建筑材料工厂。我们大量地准备和培养了恢复建设事业所必须的技术人员和技工。
    金日成说：我们全体人民都热烈拥护党和政府的政策，在城市和农村，在产业机关和运输机关，一致努力进行战后人民经济的恢复工作。这样，在停战后不过几个月中，就已在我们的城市和农村里，建设了数万所临时住宅；曾疏散到山间僻地的农民开始重建自己的家乡；市场的物价降低，人民的生活在逐步安定；被破坏的城市和工厂，制造所正在从废墟上恢复起来；很多企业不久将全面地开始生产。
    金日成接着指出：但是，这只不过是执行恢复发展战后人民经济的艰巨任务的起点。摆在我们面前更困难的任务是：把已经变成废墟的城市和农村，把工厂、企业、铁道、港口、道路、桥梁以及教育、文化、保健等设备恢复重建起来。这些任务已在一九五四—一九五六年人民经济计划草案中明确指出。这个草案是依据停战后不久召开的党中央委员会第六次全体会议所规定的战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划的基本方针制订的，不久将提交最高人民会议加以讨论和批准。
    关于一九五四—一九五六年的三年人民经济计划草案，金日成说：到三年计划的最后一年即一九五六年，我们的产业，和战前的一九四九年相比，大约将达到百分之一百五十三，其中重工业将达到百分之一百二十，轻工业将达到百分之一百三十七，化学建筑材料工业将达到百分之九十。几乎所有人民经济各部门都将达到或超过战前水平。被破坏的大工厂、企业、矿山和煤矿将全部恢复和扩大，许多新的现代化工厂将被建设起来并开始生产。
    金日成指出朝鲜人民完全能够实现这个恢复发展战后人民经济的巨大计划。他说：我们有着伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家人民的巨大的经济和技术援助，有着丰富的自然富源，有着在五年和平的恢复建设中和三年艰苦的祖国解放战争中经受考验而锻炼出来的丰富经验和人民政权。金日成接着指出了在恢复建设工作中的一些缺点，并依次谈到了关于提高产业部门各省、局的领导水平问题，关于选拔和配备经济人员和技术人员问题，关于劳动组织和劳动力问题，关于积累资金和降低成本问题，关于保证实现计划问题，关于基本建设和设计问题，关于提高生产、提高文化问题和关于加强党对产业部门的领导问题；并指出了为纠正缺点，党、国家和经济机关及其工作人员的当前任务。
    金日成在报告的最后说：只要我们党的机关、党的组织、全体党员和全体人民更加巩固地团结在我们党中央委员会和共和国政府的周围，纠正一切不良的倾向，为了完成摆在党的面前的光荣任务，以对党和祖国的无限忠诚展开不懈的斗争，在最短期间内克服在产业部门中存在的各种缺点，根本地改进各经济部门的领导工作并把它提高到政治任务的水平，那么，我们一定会胜利地完成摆在我们党、我们国家和我们人民面前的恢复建设战后人民经济的艰巨而光荣的任务，把我们的国家恢复建设得更美丽、更富强。
