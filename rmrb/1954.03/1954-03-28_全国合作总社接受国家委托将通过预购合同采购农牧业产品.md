Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Entrusted by the state, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives will pre-purchase seven kinds of agricultural and pastoral products from farmers and herdsmen in 1954, including grain, cotton, peanuts, tea, silkworm cocoons, hemp for sacks, and wool. The purpose of the state's advance purchase of these products is to stimulate agricultural production, coordinate with the state to complete the purchase plan, further strengthen the planning of industrial and agricultural production, and guide the small-scale peasant economy to gradually integrate into the national plan. In February, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives separately signed pre-purchase agreements with the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Central People's Government for cotton, peanuts, tea, and hemp for sacks, and jointly issued instructions for the pre-purchase of silkworm cocoons and wool with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the China Animal Husbandry Company. After implementing the planned purchase of grain, this year the state grain department, in order to better implement the policy of planned grain purchase and solve the difficulties of farmers in production and life, has also entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives to pre-purchase a portion of grain from farmers.
    This year's pre-purchase of agricultural products covers a wide range, and the pre-purchase areas for cotton and peanuts include more than 20 provinces such as Hebei and Shanxi in North China, Henan and Hubei in Central and Southern China, and Jiangsu and Shandong in East China. The pre-purchase of various agricultural products is mostly carried out in more concentrated producing areas, or areas where increased planting is planned, and areas where the planting area is unstable and needs to be stabilized. The main targets of pre-purchase for the seven products are agricultural production cooperatives, year-round mutual aid groups, and supply and marketing cooperative member groups. Pre-purchase is also carried out for farmers who have products to sell but have current production difficulties after appropriate organization. The form of pre-purchase is a simple pre-purchase contract signed between the grass-roots organizations of supply and marketing cooperatives and farmers. The supply and marketing cooperative pays a portion of the order cash to the farmers in advance according to the contract. According to the pre-purchase agreements signed between the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and various departments, the organized farmers will receive more deposits.

    全国合作总社接受国家委托将通过预购合同采购农牧业产品
   【新华社二十七日讯】中华全国合作社联合总社接受国家委托，一九五四年将对广大农民和牧民预购粮食、棉花、花生、茶叶、蚕茧、麻袋用麻、羊毛等七种农、牧业产品。国家预购这些产品的目的，是为了刺激农业增产，配合国家完成收购计划，进一步加强工农业生产的计划性，并引导小农经济逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。在二月份内，全国合作总社已分别和中央人民政府商业部、纺织工业部、农业部、对外贸易部签订了棉花、花生、茶叶、麻袋用麻的预购协议书，并和对外贸易部、中国畜产公司分别发出了预购蚕茧、羊毛的联合指示。国家在实行粮食的计划收购后，今年国家粮食部门为更好地贯彻粮食计划收购政策，解决农民生产上和生活上的困难，也委托供销社向农民预购一部分粮食。
    今年预购农产品的范围较广，预购棉花、花生的地区，包括华北的河北、山西，中南的河南、湖北，华东的江苏、山东等二十多个省份。各种农产品预购多在比较集中的产区，或准备增植的地区以及播种面积不稳定而需要稳定的地区。七种产品预购的主要对象是农业生产合作社和常年互助组、供销合作社社员小组，对于有产品可卖但眼前生产上有困难的农户，经适当组织后也进行预购。预购的形式是由供销合作社的基层组织和农民订立简便的预购合同。供销合作社按照合同预付一部分订购现金给农民。按照全国合作总社和各部门签订的预购协议书规定，组织起来的农民得到的订金将要多些。
