From the Examples of Increased Cotton Production in 1953, Looking at Ways to Tap the Potential for Increased Cotton Production
　　Yang Shufan
Although 1953 was a year of relatively severe natural disasters in our country, the cotton yield per unit area still reached the level of 1952. This is the result of the Party and the People's Government leading cotton farmers to organize and improve cultivation techniques over the past few years. In 1953, all cotton-growing areas promoted autumn plowing and deep plowing. Generally, farmers accumulated more fertilizer than in previous years. In addition, with the supply of commercial fertilizer, more base fertilizer and topdressing were applied to cotton fields, making the soil fertility much better than in previous years. Last year, in the northern cotton-growing areas, under the same spring drought conditions as in 1951, most cotton fields applied sowing techniques that seized moisture and connected moisture, making the sowing period about ten days earlier than in 1951, which was of great benefit to cotton growth and early harvesting. All regions also attached importance to checking seedlings, replanting, and transplanting seedlings, overcoming the serious phenomenon of missing seedlings. All regions advocated close planting, increasing the number of cotton plants in cotton fields. In the main cotton-growing areas of Shanxi Province, 70% of the cotton fields have reached more than 3,500 plants per mu; in cotton-growing areas such as Shangqiu and Huaiyang in Henan, which have always had the habit of sparse planting, the number has also increased from about 1,500 plants per mu in the past to 2,000 to 3,000 plants. Not only was the cotton pruning work more common than in the past, but also the pruning techniques were improved. Many cotton-growing areas did a more careful job of removing redundant buds and terminal buds than in previous years. After the continuous rain in July and August in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Northeast and other places, the experience of continuing pruning, pushing plants together, sunning the land, and weeding to promote early maturity of cotton was promoted in a timely manner, reversing the trend of reduced production due to excessive growth and late maturity of cotton. Agricultural production cooperatives in various places generally have higher cotton yields than mutual aid teams and individual households because they have more favorable conditions for improving technology. In addition, in 1953, some new cotton-growing areas in our country, after paying attention to improving technology, also greatly improved cotton production. For example, the production troops in the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang achieved a large-scale cotton harvest in the area; the Jinghuiqu cotton area in Shaanxi Province reversed the trend of declining production in previous years after improving cultivation and irrigation techniques; and Xinzhou County in Hubei Province also gained experience in increasing production of both wheat and cotton. This year, as long as cotton farmers in our country are further organized, improve technology, and constantly learn from the experience of increasing cotton production in various regions, they can tap the potential for increased cotton production and complete the task of increasing cotton production in our country.

Organizing Can Rapidly Improve Cotton Production
Cotton is a technical crop that requires more meticulous cultivation and management than other crops, requiring more capital and labor. Organizing can expand the strength of production investment, properly allocate labor, achieve more fertilizer application, implement deep plowing, sow in a timely manner, and do a good job in pest control, pruning, weeding, and cultivating, thereby increasing the yield of cotton per unit area. At the same time, cotton is also an important cash crop, and most or all of the cotton produced by cotton farmers must be sold. Therefore, planned increase in cotton production and organizing cotton farmers to join mutual aid teams and cooperatives are particularly important. Although natural disasters were severe in 1953, the unit area yield of agricultural production cooperatives and state farms in various cotton-producing areas not only did not decrease in most cases, but increased compared with 1952. This fully proves the superiority of collective production. For example, the cotton fields of agricultural production cooperatives throughout Shanxi Province averaged 189 jin of seed cotton per mu in 1953, an increase of 38 jin compared with 1952, which was 35.8% higher than the average cotton field yield in the province in 1953. Zhang Gendi's mutual aid team in Yizao Township, Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, consisting of twelve households, only produced an average of 60 jin of seed cotton per mu before being organized in 1951; after being organized in 1952, the average yield was 90 jin of seed cotton per mu; and in 1953, the average yield was 120 jin of seed cotton per mu. The entire team had 91 mu of cotton fields, and in 1953, the production of seed cotton increased by 5,460 jin compared with before the organization, with an average increase of more than 400 jin of seed cotton per household.

In 1953, state farms across the country also achieved higher cotton yields. State farms and agricultural production units at all levels in Xinjiang Province produced an average of 72.3 jin of lint cotton per mu on more than 60,000 mu of cotton fields, which is more than double the average cotton yield per mu of farmers in the province (31.8 jin of lint cotton). The state-owned Wulidian, Changhua, and Heyi farms in the suburbs of Beijing planted a total of 4,935 mu of cotton in 1953, with an average yield of 214 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is about 60% higher than the average cotton yield per mu in the suburbs.

The Results of Promoting Advanced Cotton Planting Technology in the Manas River Basin
The Manas River Basin is located west of Urumqi, Xinjiang, north of 44 degrees north latitude. Local farmers had never grown cotton before and believed that it was an area unsuitable for growing cotton. The agricultural production units of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, in order to supply raw materials to the national textile industry, have been trying to grow cotton in this area since 1950. Over the past four years, not only has the trial planting been successful, but also the yield per unit area has increased year by year. In 1950, the average yield was 51.2 jin of seed cotton per mu, 78.9 jin in 1951, and 120.4 jin in 1952. In 1952, cotton planting expert Chen Youle and others even achieved a bumper harvest record of more than 700 jin per mu in a small area. In 1953, 20,000 mu of cotton were planted, with an average yield of 402 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than three times that of 1952; of which, 72.45 mu had an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu; and 1.6 mu had the highest yield, with an average yield of 1,349 jin of seed cotton per mu.

The bumper harvest of cotton in the Manas River Basin is the result of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and improving cultivation techniques. Since the winter of 1952, under the guidance and help of Soviet expert Comrade Titov from Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, the production units have applied the advanced cotton planting experience of the Soviet Union and improved cotton planting techniques according to the specific local conditions. During last year's production process, Comrade Titov provided specific guidance throughout, and held many training courses, with more than 5,300 people receiving direct training and indirect instruction. The Xinjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry also organized cotton planting models from Turpan, Korla, and Kuqa to visit and practice in the Manas River Basin, which greatly inspired cotton farmers.

Our country is a country suitable for planting cotton and has vast areas suitable for planting cotton. In addition to the existing vast areas suitable for planting cotton, areas such as the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang have superior conditions and vast land for developing cotton. In the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Shandong, there are also millions of mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed for planting cotton. Sichuan has gained experience in planting cotton in mountainous areas, and there is also a wide range of land suitable for planting cotton in hilly areas below 1,600 meters above sea level. These areas will gradually increase the planting area of cotton fields and improve cotton planting technology with the development of my country's national economy, just like the Manas River Basin, making them new cotton planting bases.

The Role of Improving Cotton Field Irrigation Techniques in the Jinghuiqu Irrigated Cotton Area
The Jinghuiqu irrigated cotton area in Shaanxi Province has about 400,000 mu of cotton fields. In the years before 1952, the yield per unit area not only did not increase, but decreased year by year. In the winter of 1952 and the spring of 1953, cadres from the agricultural water conservancy department, under the guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Antonov, conducted several investigations and studies before finding out that the main reasons for the decrease in production were: improper irrigation, continuous cropping of cotton fields, and poor cultivation techniques. Based on the results of several inspections, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry formulated the "Guiding Plan for Cotton Planting Technology in the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area" and the "Implementation Plan for Work in 1953," proposing to promote winter irrigation, advance spring irrigation, change the method of flooding irrigation to ditch irrigation, implement crop rotation, advocate manure accumulation, sow in a timely manner, promote seedling development, improve pruning techniques, and strengthen the prevention and control of pests and diseases. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry also printed and distributed 5,000 copies of the inspection report, 20,000 copies of irrigation wall charts, and 50,000 copies of comic strips, and used broadcasting tubes, blackboards, etc. to carry out extensive publicity. In addition, a working group was formed to provide on-site technical guidance. After this series of technical improvements, in 1953, the average lint cotton yield per mu in the 380,000 mu of cotton fields in the entire irrigation area increased to about 60 jin, an increase of 1.4 times compared with 1952.

Developing cotton field irrigation is an important measure to increase cotton production. In the future, in cotton-growing areas with conditions such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Henan, Xinjiang, and Jiangsu, opening canals, digging wells, and tapping the potential of existing irrigation equipment can greatly expand the irrigated area of cotton fields. If we can also pay attention to improving irrigation technology, we can greatly increase cotton production.

An Example of Comprehensive Increase in Wheat and Cotton Production in Double-Cropped Cotton Areas
Hubei Province is a major cotton-producing province, and 90% of the cotton fields are cultivated in a double-cropping system. More than half of the winter crops in double-cropped cotton fields are wheat with a relatively long growing period. In order to summarize the experience of increasing production in double-cropped cotton areas, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry set up a base point in Liuji Township, Xinzhou County, E'dong. In 1953, under the circumstances that cotton production generally decreased in the province, the 3,596.95 mu of double-cropped cotton fields in the township still harvested an average of 250 jin of wheat and 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. Cai Xiubo, a labor model, harvested an average of 335 jin of wheat and 311.5 jin of seed cotton per mu on 1.4 mu of high-yield land.

The cultivation experience gained by Liuji Township, Xinzhou County, in increasing production of both cotton and wheat over the past two years mainly includes: selecting early-maturing and high-yielding Dai-character cotton seeds and "Nanda 2419" wheat seeds that are late-sown, early-maturing, and have stalks that do not lodge; timely pulling out cotton stalks and carrying out autumn plowing, strip-sowing wheat so that cotton can be strip-sown between wheat rows in a timely manner; applying sufficient base fertilizer to wheat fields, applying topdressing fertilizer to wheat fields before jointing in early spring, and applying base fertilizer to cotton fields between wheat rows when wheat is in full ear and nearly milky ripe; quick hoeing after wheat harvest, and then applying water manure to promote seedling emergence and promote the development of cotton seedlings. In addition, attention was paid to cotton field thinning and transplanting, weeding and cultivating, timely topdressing, drought resistance and drainage, topping and pruning, and pest control to promote early maturity of cotton.

In the southern cotton-growing areas, double-cropped cotton fields planted with winter crops account for about 30% of the total cotton field area in the country. Generally, the pre-crop and cotton yield are very low. The experience of Liuji Township proves that it is entirely possible to improve cultivation techniques on the basis of the original double-cropping system and strive to increase the yield of both wheat and cotton.

Low-Yield Cotton Areas Cannot Be Called Low-Yield Forever
Since the Southern Cotton Area Technical Symposium proposed the issue of improving historical low-yield cotton areas in February 1953, the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Central South Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry have organized forces three times to conduct systematic investigations and analyses in the low-yield cotton areas of northern Hubei, and put forward specific improvement opinions: First, it is necessary to develop mutual assistance and cooperation in response to the situation in the cotton areas of northern Hubei, where there are few people and a lot of land, a lack of labor, and extensive cultivation, in order to improve labor efficiency; second, it is necessary to open up fertilizer sources in many ways in response to the heavy and infertile soil, improve manure accumulation and fertilization methods, and gradually deepen the cultivated layer to improve the soil quality; again, it is to improve the double-cropping cultivation technology of wheat and cotton, and overcome the shortcomings of not plowing the land, not applying base fertilizer, and scattering lazy flowers before sowing cotton in the double-cropping system; in addition, attention must be paid to seed selection, pest control, drought resistance, flood prevention and other work. At the Hubei Provincial Cotton Production Technical Conference in December 1953, the issue of how to improve the cotton yield in the cotton areas of northern Hubei was discussed in detail, and the "Production Increase Plan for Cotton Areas in Northern Hubei" was formulated, preparing to set up 19 key points in the main cotton-producing areas of Xiangyang Prefecture in 1954, strengthen leadership, allocate sufficient technical cadres, and vigorously promote this work, in order to change this historical low-yield situation from 1954.

The areas of northern Hubei, southern Henan, and Fuyang and Suxian in Anhui Province, and Huaiyin in Jiangsu Province, with a total of more than 6.6 million mu of cotton fields, are all historical low-yield cotton areas. Strengthening technical guidance to these cotton areas, adopting different methods according to different conditions, and exploring potential can increase production.

At present, various places are arranging to appropriately expand cotton fields in areas suitable for growing cotton according to the needs of national industrial production and civilian cotton wool, which is completely necessary. However, the main way to increase cotton production in our country is to improve the yield per unit area. Therefore, organizing cotton farmers according to the different conditions of each region, studying and improving cotton planting technology, and tapping the potential for increasing production, so that the original high-yield areas are further improved, and the yield of low-yield areas is gradually improved, is of greater significance. The above-mentioned some examples of increased cotton production in 1953 are worth publicizing widely in various places to inspire cotton farmers to improve cotton planting technology, increase their confidence in increasing production, and work hard to complete the national plan.

    从一九五三年棉花增产的范例中，看挖掘棉花增产潜力的途径
  　杨树藩
    一九五三年虽然是我国自然灾害比较严重的一年，但是棉花单位面积产量仍达到了一九五二年的水平。这是几年来党和人民政府领导棉农组织起来改进耕作技术的结果。一九五三年，各棉区都推行了秋耕深耕，一般农家所积肥料都多于往年，再加上商品肥料的供应，棉田中增施了基肥和追肥，使土壤的肥力比往年好得多了。北方棉区去年在相同于一九五一年的春旱情况下，多数棉田都应用了抢墒、接墒的播种技术，使播种期比一九五一年提早了十天左右，这对棉花生长和提早收摘期都有很大好处。各地还都重视了查苗、补种、移苗工作，克服了严重的缺苗现象。各地提倡密植，使棉田中棉花株数普遍增多，山西省的主要棉区，百分之七十的棉田，每亩已达三千五百株以上；河南商邱、淮阳一带一向有稀植习惯的棉区，也由过去每亩一千五百株左右，提高到二千株至三千株。棉花整枝工作不但较过去普遍，而且在整枝技术上也有所提高，许多棉区对打赘芽、摘边心的工作都做得比往年细致。河北、山西、河南、山东、东北等地，在七、八月份连绵霪雨以后，及时地推广了继续整枝、推株并垄、晒地、锄地等促进棉花早熟的经验，挽回了棉花疯长晚熟的减产趋势。各地农业生产合作社因为改进技术的条件比较优越，棉花产量一般都高于互助组、单干户。此外，一九五三年我国一些新的植棉区，在注意改进技术以后，棉花生产也大大提高，如新疆玛纳斯河流域生产部队就在该地获得了棉花大面积丰收；陕西省泾惠渠棉区改进耕作和灌溉技术以后，扭转了历年减产的趋势；湖北新洲县也获得了棉麦两熟都能增产的经验。我国棉农今年只要进一步组织起来，改进技术，并不断学习各个地区棉花增产的经验，就可以挖掘棉花增产的潜力，完成我国棉花增产的任务。组织起来才能迅速提高棉花生产
    棉花是技术作物，在耕作、管理上要比旁的庄稼细致，需要的资金多、劳力也多。组织起来，就可以扩大生产投资的力量，适当调配劳力，做到多施肥料、实行深耕、及时播种，并做好治虫、整枝、除草中耕工作，提高棉花单位面积产量。同时，棉花又是重要的商品作物，棉农生产的棉花，大部或全部要出售，所以有计划地增产棉花，组织棉农加入互助组、合作社，就更显得特别重要。一九五三年自然灾害虽然严重，但各产棉区农业生产合作社和国营农场的单位面积产量，不但大部没有降低，反比一九五二年提高了，这就充分证明了集体生产的优越性。如山西省全省农业生产合作社的棉田，一九五三年平均每亩产籽棉一百八十九斤，比一九五二年增产三十八斤，高于一九五三年全省棉田平均产量百分之三十五点八。江苏省南汇县一灶乡张根弟互助组，十二户，一九五一年没有组织起来以前，平均每亩只产籽棉六十斤；一九五二年组织起来以后，平均每亩产籽棉九十斤；一九五三年平均每亩产了籽棉一百二十斤。全组有棉田九十一亩，一九五三年比组织起来以前增产籽棉五千四百六十斤，平均每户增加了四百多斤籽棉的收入。
    一九五三年全国各地国营农场的棉花，也都获得了较高的产量。新疆全省各级国营农场及农业生产部队，在六万多亩棉田上，平均每亩产皮棉七十二点三斤，相当于全省农民平均每亩棉花产量（三十一点八斤皮棉）的一倍多。北京郊区的国营五里店、彰化、和义等农场，一九五三年共种四千九百三十五亩棉花，平均每亩产籽棉二百十四斤，高于郊区平均每亩棉花产量百分之六十左右。玛纳斯河流域推行先进植棉技术的成果
    玛纳斯河流域在新疆乌鲁木齐以西，北纬四十四度以北。当地农民过去没有种过棉花，并认为那是不适合种棉花的地区。驻新疆人民解放军农业生产部队，为了供应国家纺织工业原料，自一九五○年起在这个地区试种棉花，四年来不但试种成功，而且单位面积产量逐年上升。一九五○年平均每亩产籽棉五十一点二斤，一九五一年为七十八点九斤，一九五二年为一百二十点四斤，一九五二年植棉能手陈友乐等更获得了小面积每亩七百斤以上的丰产纪录。一九五三年种棉两万亩，平均每亩产籽棉四百零二斤，为一九五二年的三倍多；其中平均每亩产量在八百斤以上的，有七十二点四五亩；产量最高的一点六亩，平均每亩产籽棉一千三百四十九斤。
    玛纳斯河流域的棉花丰收，是学习苏联先进经验，改进耕作技术的结果。自一九五二年冬季开始，生产部队即在新疆八一农学院苏联专家提托夫同志的指导和帮助下，根据当地具体情况，运用了苏联先进植棉经验，改进了植棉技术。在去年生产过程中，提托夫同志一直进行具体指导，先后举办了许多期训练班，受到直接训练和间接传授的有五千三百多人。新疆省农林厅并曾组织吐鲁番、库尔勒、库车等地的植棉模范赴玛纳斯河流域参观实习，给棉农以极大的启发。
    我国是一个适宜植棉的国家，有广阔适宜植棉的地区：除现有的广大适宜植棉的地区外，新疆玛纳斯河流域等地区对发展棉花有优越条件和广阔的土地，在江苏、山东沿海地区，还有几百万亩可以开垦植棉的荒地。四川在山地植棉已取得了经验，在海拔一千六百公尺以下的丘陵地区，也有广泛的适宜植棉的土地。这些地区将随着我国国民经济的发展，和玛纳斯河流域一样，逐步地增加棉田种植面积，改进植棉技术，使之变为新的植棉基地。
  泾惠渠灌溉棉区改进棉田灌溉
    技术的作用
    陕西省泾惠渠灌溉棉区，有四十万亩左右的棉田，在一九五二年以前的几年，单位面积产量不但没有得到提高，反而一年比一年降低了。一九五二年冬和一九五三年春天农业水利部门干部，在苏联专家安东诺夫同志指导下，经过几次调查研究，才找出了减产的主要原因是：灌溉不得法，棉田多连作，耕作技术不好。陕西省农林厅根据几次考察的结果，制定了“泾惠渠灌溉区植棉技术指导方案”与“一九五三年工作实施计划”，提出了推行冬灌、提早春灌，改大水漫灌方法为沟灌，实行倒茬轮作，提倡积肥，适时播种，促进幼苗发育，提高整枝技术，加强防治病虫害等改进措施。农林厅并印发了考察报告五千册，灌溉挂图二万份，漫画五万份，同时利用广播筒、黑板报等，进行广泛宣传。此外，还组成了工作组，实地进行技术指导。经过这一系列的技术改进，一九五三年全灌溉区三十八万亩棉田，平均每亩皮棉产量提高到六十斤左右，比一九五二年增产了一点四倍。
    发展棉田灌溉，是增产棉花的一项重要措施。今后在河北、山西、陕西、山东、河南、新疆及江苏等有条件的棉区，开渠、打井，并发挥现有灌溉设备的潜力，即可大量扩大棉田灌溉面积，如果还能注意改进灌溉技术，就能够大大提高棉花产量。
  两熟棉区小麦棉花全面增产的
      一个范例
    湖北省是一个主要产棉省，百分之九十的棉田是两熟制栽培，两熟棉田的冬季作物有半数以上是生长期比较长的小麦。湖北省农林厅为了总结两熟棉区的增产经验，在鄂东新洲县刘集乡设立了基点。一九五三年在全省一般棉区普遍减产的情况下，该乡三千五百九十六点九五亩两熟棉田，平均每亩仍收小麦二百五十斤，收籽棉一百五十斤。劳动模范蔡秀波一点四亩丰产地，平均每亩收小麦三百三十五斤，收籽棉三百十一点五斤。
    新洲县刘集乡两年来在棉麦两熟增产上，取得的耕作经验，主要是：选种早熟丰产的岱字棉种，和晚播、早熟、秆梗不倒伏的“南大二四一九”号麦种；适时赶拔棉秸，进行秋耕，条播种麦，以便及时在麦行间条播棉花；施足麦田基肥，早春小麦拔节前施麦田追肥，当小麦齐穗近乳熟期可在麦行间施棉田基肥；小麦收割后要快锄，并随即施用水粪提苗，促进棉花幼苗发育。此外，还注意了棉田间苗移苗、除草中耕、适时追肥、抗旱排水、摘心整枝、防治虫害等工作，促进棉花早熟。
    南方棉区种冬季作物的两熟棉田，约占全国棉田总面积的百分之三十左右，一般棉花的前期作物和棉花产量都很低。刘集乡的经验证明，在原有两熟的基础上改进耕作技术，争取小麦和棉花都提高产量，是完全可能的。
  不能叫低产棉区永远低产
    自一九五三年二月南方棉区技术座谈会上，提出了改进历史性低产棉区的问题以后，中央农业部、中南农林局、湖北农林厅，曾组织力量，三次深入鄂北低产棉区，进行了有系统的调查分析，并提出了具体的改进意见：首先必须针对鄂北棉区人少地多，劳力缺乏，耕作粗放的情形，发展互助合作，以提高劳动效率；其次，要针对土质粘重瘠薄的情况，多方面开辟肥源，改进积肥和施肥方法，并逐步加深耕层，改善土质；再次是改进麦棉两熟栽培技术，克服两熟制棉花播种前不耕地、不施基肥及撒懒花的缺点；此外，并须注意选种、治虫、抗旱、防涝等工作。一九五三年十二月湖北省棉产工作技术会议上，对如何提高鄂北棉区的棉花产量问题，又作了重点讨论，制订了“鄂北棉区增产方案”，准备一九五四年在襄阳专区主要产棉地区设置十九个重点，加强领导，配备足够的技术干部，大力推进这一工作，以求从一九五四年起改变这一历史性的低产情况。
    鄂北、豫南以及安徽省阜阳、宿县、江苏省淮阴一带，共有六百六十余万亩棉田的地区，都是历史性的低产棉区。加强对这些棉区的技术指导，根据不同条件，采取不同的方法，发掘潜力，就可提高产量。
    目前，各地正在按照国家工业生产和民用絮棉的需要，布置在宜于种棉的地区适当扩大棉田，这是完全必要的。但是，我国棉花增产主要还是靠提高单位面积产量，所以，按照各地区的不同情况，把棉农组织起来，研究改进植棉技术，发挥增产潜力，使原来产量高的更加提高，使低产地区的产量逐步提高，是具有更为重大的意义的。上面所谈的
  一九五三年棉花增产的一些事例，值得在各地广泛宣传，以启发棉农改进植棉技术，提高增产信心，为完成国家计划努力。
