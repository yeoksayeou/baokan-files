Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 25th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Steel Plant completed the first quarter's state production plan eight days ahead of schedule. The steel produced by the steel plant workers in the first quarter was more than the output in the first half of 1943 during the puppet Manchukuo period.

After studying the Party's general line during the transition period, the steel plant workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and collectivism. Each shift created favorable steelmaking conditions for the next shift and further studied the Soviet Union's fast steelmaking experience. As a result, high-quality steel made by the rapid steelmaking method appeared in many open-hearth furnaces. On February 20th, March 5th, and March 15th, the highest daily output records since the plant opened were created three times in a row. The new record created on March 15th was 9% higher than the highest daily output last year.

In the first quarter, the steel plant workers produced a large number of high-quality steels such as seamless steel and heavy rail steel, which strongly supported the country's economic construction. The steel produced by the steel plant workers for the country in the first quarter, if rolled into steel bars, would be enough to build dozens of five-story buildings.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan: Anshan Iron and Steel Company recently selected more than 80 excellent cadres and workers to study advanced production management methods and production technology in the Soviet Union. Most of them are workshop directors, team leaders, group leaders, and skilled workers with many years of practical work experience and promising prospects for development. There are also some factory directors and section-level cadres. They will study in the Soviet Union for one to one and a half years. After returning to China, they will participate in the work of the newly built and expanded thin plate plant, the second steelmaking plant, the second primary rolling plant, and other factories and mines. Previously, the two batches of employees sent by Anshan Iron and Steel to study in the Soviet Union have now become the mainstays in the production and management of large rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants. They also conscientiously teach the technology and experience they have learned in the Soviet Union to many other management cadres, technical personnel, and workers.

    鞍钢炼钢厂提前八天完成第一季度计划
    鞍钢又选派了优秀的干部和工人到苏联学习
    【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂提前八天完成了第一季度的国家生产计划。炼钢厂工人在第一季度所生产的钢，比伪满时期一九四三年上半年的产量还要多。
    炼钢厂工人学习了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，发挥了高度的积极性和集体主义精神，各班都相互为下一班创造良好的炼钢条件，并进一步学习了苏联快速炼钢的经验。这样，在许多平炉上都出现了快速炼钢法所炼成的优质钢，在二月二十日、三月五日、三月十五日连续三次创造了开厂以来日产量的最高纪录。三月十五日那天所创造的新纪录比去年最高日产量要多百分之九。
    在第一季度，炼钢厂工人炼出了无缝钢、重轨钢等大批的优质钢，有力的支援了全国的经济建设。炼钢厂工人在第一季为国家所增产的钢，如果轧制钢筋，足可以盖数十座五层楼的大厦。
   【新华社鞍山讯】鞍山钢铁公司最近又选派了八十多个优秀的干部和工人，赴苏联学习先进的生产管理方法和生产技术。其中大部分是有多年实际工作经验和有培养前途的车间主任、班长、组长和技术工人，也有些厂长和处长级干部。他们将要在苏联学习一年到一年半，归国以后，将参加新建和扩建成功的薄板厂、第二炼钢厂、第二初轧厂和其他厂矿的工作。以前，鞍钢派往苏联学习的两批职工，现在已成为大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂在生产和管理工作中的主要骨干，他们并把在苏联学到的技术和经验，认真地传授给其他许多管理干部、技术人员和工人。
