    Southwest Region Completes General Election in Areas with Over 70 Million People
    Third Phase of Grassroots Elections Expanding Widely to Remote Areas
    The second phase of grassroots election work in the Southwest Region has been basically completed. Currently, the third phase of grassroots elections in the region is expanding widely towards border and mountainous areas.
    According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of February, general elections have been completed in areas with approximately 71 million people in the entire Southwest Region. The grassroots elections in Xikang, Chongqing, Chengdu and other provinces and cities have all concluded. Sichuan Province has also basically concluded its elections. Currently, over 12,600 grassroots units in the province have completed their elections, accounting for approximately 96.8 percent of the total number of grassroots units that should hold elections in the province, with a population of approximately 56 million. In Guizhou Province, general elections have been completed in over 3,000 townships and towns, with a population of over 7 million. Yunnan Province, where the general election work started later, has completed the elections in over 300 townships and areas with a population of approximately 2 million. Currently, grassroots elections in the Southwest Region are being carried out in depth in remote areas. Guizhou Province started the third phase of general elections around mid-February. Yunnan Province comprehensively launched the general election campaign in eleven special districts, including Chuxiong, Qujing, Dali, Lijiang, and Yuxi, in January this year. Many border and remote mountainous areas in the province are enthusiastically carrying out elections.
    The second phase of grassroots election work in the Southwest Region was carried out on the basis of in-depth study of the general line of the state's transition period by the broad masses of people. People from all walks of life have shown particularly high political enthusiasm and actively participated in the elections. In many counties and cities in Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces, the number of voters participating in the elections reached 90 percent or more, even 95 percent or more. All localities put forward the slogans of "Electing active elements who are enthusiastic about the cause of socialism" and "Electing leaders who take the socialist road," and selected the representatives they were most satisfied with. Gao Fuxing, the director of the agricultural production cooperative in the seventh village of Beiwa Township, Daxian County, Sichuan Province, often conducted socialist education among the masses. Under his leadership, the first agricultural production cooperative was established in the township, and all voters in the village unanimously elected him as a people's representative. Among the 719 representatives elected from 23 grassroots units in the suburban area of Wutongqiao City, Leshan Special District, 48 percent were excellent Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Eleven Communist Party members in Yongshou Township, Luxian County, had a high prestige among the masses and were all elected as people's representatives.
    The second phase of the general election movement in the Southwest Region fully absorbed the experience of the pilot areas and the first phase of the general election, especially the experience combined with production, which promoted production work. Voters in Chuxiong, Yiliang, Mengzi, Xuanwei and other counties in Yunnan Province put forward the slogan of "Organizing to do a good job in production and welcoming the general election." They actively repaired ditches and weirs, solving the problem of water shortage in the early spring. In the general election, Erjia Township, Nanchong County, Sichuan Province, closely combined the election with production, which mobilized the 72 mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the township to take active action. They built 13 river weirs, prevented and controlled rice borers in 500 mu of farmland within three days, and completed the mid-tillage work of wheat fields throughout the township.

    西南区已在七千多万人口地区完成普选
    第三期基层选举正向边远地区广泛展开
    西南区第二期基层选举工作已基本完成。目前，该区第三期基层选举正向边疆和山区地带广泛展开。
    据不完全统计，截至二月底止，西南全区已有约七千一百多万人口的地区完成普选工作。西康、重庆、成都等省、市的基层选举已全部结束。四川省也已基本结束。目前该省结束选举工作的有一万二千六百多个基层单位，约占全省应进行选举的基层单位总数的百分之九十六点八，人口共约五千六百多万。贵州省也有三千多个乡、镇、七百多万人口的地区完成普选。普选工作开展较迟的云南省已在三百多个乡、约二百万人口的地区内完成。目前，西南区基层选举正向边远地区深入展开。贵州省已在二月中旬前后开始了第三期普选。云南省今年一月份内已在楚雄、曲靖、大理、丽江、玉溪等十一个专区全面展开了普选运动，该省许多边疆和遥远的山区地带正热烈地展开选举。
    西南区各省第二期基层选举工作是在广大人民群众深入学习国家过渡时期总路线的基础上进行的。各界人民政治热情特别高涨，踊跃参加选举。四川、贵州等省许多县、市参加选举的选民都达到了百分之九十或百分之九十五以上。各地都提出“选热心于社会主义事业的积极分子”、“选走社会主义道路的带路人”的口号，挑选他们最满意的代表。四川省达县北外乡第七村农业生产合作社社长高复兴经常向群众进行社会主义教育，在他带头推动下，全乡建立了第一个农业生产合作社，全村选民一致选他为人民代表。在乐山专区五通桥市郊区二十三个基层单位选出来的七百一十九名代表中，有百分之四十八是优秀的共产党员和青年团员。泸县永寿乡十一个共产党员在群众中具有很高的威信，全部被选为人民代表。
    西南区第二期普选运动充分吸收了试办地区和第一期普选的经验，特别是结合生产的经验，使普选运动推动了生产工作。云南省楚雄、宜良、蒙自、宣威等县的选民都提出“组织起来搞好生产，迎接普选”的口号。他们积极修沟、修堰，解决了小春缺水的困难。四川省南充县二家乡在普选中紧密结合了生产，使该乡七十二个互助组联合单干农民积极行动起来，修筑了十三道河堰，三天内在五百亩面积的农田里防治了螟虫，并完成了全乡小麦地的中耕工作。　（新华社）
