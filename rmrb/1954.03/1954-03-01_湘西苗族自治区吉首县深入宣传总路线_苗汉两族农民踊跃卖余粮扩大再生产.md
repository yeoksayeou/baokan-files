Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, Deeply Publicizes the General Line
Miao and Han Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain to Expand Reproduction

More than 70,000 Miao and Han farmers in Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, have received education on the general line. Their socialist awareness has been raised, and they voluntarily sell their surplus grain to the state to support national construction, and invest the money from selling grain into agricultural production.

Jishou County is one of the minority areas in Hunan Province that has completed land reform. Last November, the county party committee organized more than 2,000 Miao and Han cadres and farmer representatives to study the general line. In the study, the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present and picture exhibitions was adopted to explain the changes in farmers' production and life before and after liberation, the comparison of prices of industrial and agricultural products, and the benefits of organizing and the harms of taking the capitalist road. In the past, Miao farmers lived on wild vegetables and kudzu root flour. After liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, in 1953 alone, they received a total of more than 800 million yuan in loans, grain loans, and relief funds, which enabled the county to harvest more than 8.2 million catties of rice than in 1952, and people were able to eat rice and corn. Through these facts, they realized the benefits of socialist industrialization in improving the production and life of ethnic minorities. Miao cadre Comrade Chen Qianwen said: "If the national industry had not developed, how could we eat such cheap salt!" Some Miao farmer representatives said: "With Chairman Mao's leadership, the Miao people can be their own masters. There is no mistake in following the path pointed out by Chairman Mao." Many cadres and representatives made plans to increase production and practice economy, and voluntarily sell surplus grain to the state to realize socialism sooner.

In Jishou County, the general line is also publicized to the masses in the form of the Miao language and Miao song teams. Miao farmers love Miao songs. Miao song teams have been generally organized in various townships in the Fifth District. At the beginning and end of each meeting, and during production or rest, they sing songs publicizing the general line. Chen Xufeng, an 84-year-old Miao farmer, never attended meetings, but came when he heard the singing. He heard people sing "There are two roads in front of the farmers, one is dark and the other is bright, may I ask brother singer where to go..." and sang along: "To go towards socialism." Miao farmer Xiong Mingde immediately volunteered to sell 1,000 catties of surplus grain after hearing others sing: "Don't forget Chairman Mao when you get the land, don't forget the tree planter when you eat the fruit, if you have grain and don't sell it to the cooperative, how can you be worthy of your relatives." In addition, various places also adopted methods of informal talks, recalling the past and comparing accounts, and mobilizing close friends to launch patriotic grain sales. Miao women love labor and can play an active role in various tasks. Special attention was paid to mobilizing women when publicizing the general line in various places. Miao woman Yang Changxiu said that she couldn't even afford embroidery needles in the past, but now she can sew lace clothes with cheap embroidery needles: "The benefits of industrialization are really great, we must also support industrial construction; the more grain is sold, the sooner good days will come." After the Miao and Han farmers received the publicity and education of the general line, they sold more than 5.58 million catties of surplus grain. Miao farmers in the Second District sent all 760,000 catties of surplus grain to the state warehouse within 15 days. On the way to deliver grain to the cooperative, Long Shenglai, a Miao farmer from Pai Xiong Township, was stopped by profiteers who tried to buy it at a price of 3,000 yuan more per dou of grain. He said angrily: "I won't sell it to you even if you give me 10,000 more, I will carry it to the cooperative even if I sweat all over."

Now, Miao and Han farmers in Jishou County are actively participating in mutual aid organizations, vigorously repairing ponds and accumulating fertilizer, and investing the money from selling grain into expanding reproduction. They know deeply that only by producing more grain and supporting industrial construction can they live a prosperous life together. Miao farmers in Jibai Township newly organized eight temporary mutual aid teams, and four mutual aid teams that had broken up were also restored. The original sixteen mutual aid teams expanded by thirty-two households. Farmer Shi Layuan said: "Our Miao people want to go to socialism with everyone, and there is only one broad road to get organized." Driven by the mutual aid teams, sixty-eight Dingguan ponds for drought prevention in mountain fields were newly built in the county. Miao farmers in Pingyang Township bought 7,350 catties of dried cake fertilizer and 289 catties of pig iron from Baojing County, more than a hundred miles away, with the money they earned from selling grain, preparing to make farm tools and expand reproduction.　　　(Tan Jun)

    湘西苗族自治区吉首县深入宣传总路线
    苗汉两族农民踊跃卖余粮扩大再生产
    湘西苗族自治区吉首县十万多苗、汉两族农民，已有七万多人受到了总路线的教育。他们的社会主义觉悟提高了，自愿把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设，并把卖粮所得的钱，投入农业生产。
    吉首县是湖南省完成土地改革的少数民族地区之一。去年十一月间，县委组织了二千多个苗、汉两族干部和农民代表进行总路线学习。在学习中，采用回忆对比和图片展览的方法，说明解放前后农民生产、生活的变化，工农业品价格的对比，以及组织起来的好处和走资本主义道路的害处。苗族农民过去吃野菜、葛粑过日子，解放后，在党和人民政府的领导和扶助下，单在一九五三年就得到贷款、贷粮、救济款共八亿多元，使全县比一九五二年多收获八百二十多万斤稻谷，人们能够吃上米和苞谷了。通过这些事实，他们认识到了社会主义工业化对提高少数民族生产、生活的好处。苗族干部陈千文同志说：“要不是国家工业有了发展，哪里能够吃到这么便宜的盐啊！”有的苗族农民代表说：“有毛主席领导，苗家才得当家作主，照毛主席指点的路走没有错。”许多干部和代表订出增产节约计划，自愿把余粮卖给国家，好早一天实现社会主义。
    吉首县各地还用苗族语言和苗歌队的宣传形式向群众宣传总路线。苗族农民热爱苗歌。五区各乡普遍组织了苗歌队，在每次会议的会头会尾，在生产或休息的时候，唱宣传总路线的歌，八十四岁的苗族老农陈绪凤从来不参加会，听到歌声也赶来了，他听了人家唱“农民面前路两条，一条黑暗一条明，请问歌兄何处去……”跟着唱：“要朝社会主义行。”苗族农民熊明德听了别人歌唱：“得田不忘毛主席，吃果不忘种树人，有粮不卖合作社，如何对得起亲人”，立即自愿卖出余粮一千斤。此外，各地还采用漫谈、回忆对比算细账和知心人发动知心人的办法，发动爱国卖粮工作。苗族妇女爱好劳动，在各种工作中都能起积极作用。各地在宣传总路线时特别注意了发动妇女。苗族妇女杨昌秀谈到过去连绣花针都买不起，现在能用便宜的绣花针缝花边衣服穿时说：“工业化的好处真不小，我们也要来支援工业建设；粮卖得多，好日子就来得快。”苗、汉两族农民经过总路线的宣传教育，卖出余粮五百五十八万多斤，二区苗族农民把七十六万多斤余粮在十五天内全部送入国家仓库。排兄乡苗族农民龙生来挑粮送到合作社的路上，奸商拦路以每斗粮多给三千元的价钱企图抢购，他愤愤地说：“多出一万也不卖给你，我挑出一身汗水也要送到合作社。”
    现在，吉首县苗、汉两族农民正积极参加互助组织，大力修塘积肥，把卖粮所得的钱投入扩大再生产。他们深深知道：只有更加多打粮食，支援工业建设，才能过大家富裕的生活。吉白乡苗族农民新组织了八个临时互助组，四个散伙的互助组也恢复了，原有十六个互助组扩大了三十二户。农民石腊远说：“我们苗族要和大家一起到社会主义，只有走组织起来一条大路。”在互助组的带动下，全县新修了山田防旱的鼎罐塘六十八个。坪阳乡苗族农民把卖粮得的钱从一百里以外的保靖县买回枯饼七千三百五十斤，毛铁二百八十九斤，准备打农具，扩大再生产。　　　（谭军）
