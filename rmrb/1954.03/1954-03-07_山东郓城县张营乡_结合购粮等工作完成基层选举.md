Shandong Yuncheng County Zhangying Township
Completes Grassroots Elections in Conjunction with Grain Procurement and Other Work

Zhangying Township in the Second District of Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, completed its grassroots general election in conjunction with central tasks such as grain procurement. All the work in the township was carried out under the unified leadership of the Party branch. The Party branch assigned specific personnel to be responsible for the general election work and formulated a general election work plan and publicity materials. The township's propagandists, based on the publicity materials formulated by the Party branch, carried out publicity on the significance of the general election to the masses in various ways, divided by street. Before carrying out the general election work, the township trained twenty-seven general election technical personnel. After the general election technical personnel went to the countryside, they conducted population surveys and voter registration using mobile registration methods while carrying out publicity work, and combined this with reviewing voter qualifications. The entire township completed the population survey in three days. At this time, the township election committee formally announced the list of voters. The township Party branch and representatives of people's organizations negotiated and proposed a preliminary list of representative candidates. Then, each electoral district, with mutual aid teams as the main body, absorbed voters from outside the teams to participate in discussions on the preliminary list. After the work of the township's voters discussing the representative candidates was completed, the masses began to consider organizing mutual aid teams, carrying out winter plowing, and voluntarily reporting the amount of surplus grain they would sell to the state. At this time, the township election committee used the gaps in the schedule to convene election meetings in each electoral district. The elected people's representatives introduced their understanding of the general line and the general election work at the meeting, as well as their production plans and plans to sell surplus grain to the state. The representatives also expressed that they must lead everyone to do a good job in production and mutual cooperation, and strive to achieve socialism at an early date. Soon, the township convened a People's Congress. That evening, the first meeting of the Township People's Government Committee was held.

Zhangying Township completed the general election in conjunction with the central work, and the general election work in turn promoted the completion of other tasks. For example, 3,900 mu of land in the township has already been winter-plowed, accounting for more than 86% of the spring land. The farmers have also launched a high tide of accumulating dry ash and accumulating urine fertilizer; some farmers have bought cattle and are preparing to expand production this year. In the past, only six households in the township participated in mutual aid teams, but now 338 households have participated in mutual aid teams, accounting for half of the total number of households in the township. The farmers of the whole township are also actively selling surplus grain to the state. According to preliminary statistics alone, more than 21,000 jin of surplus grain has been sold.

    山东郓城县张营乡
    结合购粮等工作完成基层选举
    山东省郓城县第二区张营乡结合购粮等中心工作，完成了基层普选。该乡的各项工作，是在党支部的统一领导下进行的。党支部确定了专人负责普选工作，制订了普选工作计划和宣传材料。乡的宣传员，依据党支部制订的宣传材料，按街道分工，运用各种方式向群众展开了普选意义的宣传。该乡在开展普选工作之前，训练了二十七名普选工作技术人员。普选技术人员下乡后，在进行宣传工作同时，采用流动登记办法，进行人口调查和选民登记工作，并结合审查选民资格。全乡在三天内就完成了人口调查工作。这时，乡选举委员会正式公布选民名单。中共乡支部和人民团体代表协商提出代表候选人初步名单。然后各选区以互助组为主吸收组外选民参加讨论初步名单。全乡选民讨论代表候选人的工作结束后，群众就开始酝酿组织互助组，进行冬耕，并自报向国家卖余粮的数字。这时乡选举委员会利用空隙，在各选区分别召开选举大会。当选的人民代表，在会上介绍了自己对总路线和普选工作的认识，以及自己的生产计划，向国家卖余粮的打算。代表们还表示一定要领导大家搞好生产和互助合作工作，为争取早日实现社会主义而努力。不久，全乡召开了人民代表大会。当天晚上又召开了第一次乡人民政府委员会议。
    张营乡结合中心工作完成了普选，普选工作又反过来推动了其他各项工作的完成。例如全乡已冬耕地三千九百亩，占春地的百分之八十六强。农民们并掀起了积干灰、积尿肥的热潮；有的农民买了牛，准备今年扩大生产。过去全乡只有六户参加互助组，现在有三百三十八户参加了互助组，占全乡总户数的一半。全乡农民并积极把余粮卖给国家，仅初步统计，已卖出余粮两万一千余斤。
