All employees participating in the construction of the Northeast Region's 220 kV extra-high voltage transmission line project wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong on February 10th, reporting their victorious early completion of the construction task. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are excited to report to you that the newly built 220 kV extra-high voltage transmission line project in the Northeast Region was completed ahead of schedule on January 23rd, with a saving of 2.1 billion yuan in investment. After testing, inspection, and trial operation, the transmission line has proven to be of excellent quality and was officially energized on January 27th.

This project was designed and constructed entirely by our country, following the advanced technical regulations of the Soviet Union, with more than 90% of the equipment and materials supplied domestically. Because we had no experience in the design, processing, and construction of extra-high voltage transmission line projects, and because time was tight, this task was extremely complex and arduous for us. However, by following your teachings, under the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the higher authorities, with the specific guidance of Soviet experts and the strong support of fraternal enterprises and the Party, government, and farmers in the counties and districts along the line, we finally overcame various difficulties and victoriously completed the entire project ahead of schedule.

In order to welcome more and more arduous construction tasks in the future and strive for greater victories, we are determined, under your teachings, under the brilliant light of the general line, and under the leadership of the Party and higher authorities, to give full play to the working class's spirit of hard struggle, further learn from the Soviet Union, strive to improve our political, technical, and management levels, and greet and complete the national construction plan without arrogance or impetuosity, and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization! We extend to you our highest respects and wish you boundless longevity!

The entire staff participating in the extra-high voltage transmission line project of the Northeast Electric Power Administration of the Central People's Government Ministry of Fuel Industry

    参加东北超高压送电线路工程的全体职工向毛主席报告提前完成建设任务
   【本报讯】全体参加建设东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线路工程的职工，曾在二月十日写信给毛泽东主席，报告他们胜利地提前完成建设任务。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们兴奋地向您报告：东北区新建的二十二万伏超高压送电线路工程，已在一月二十三日提前竣工，并节省投资二十一亿元。送电线路经过试验、检查及试运转，证明质量优良，已于一月二十七日正式送电。
    这一工程是按照苏联的先进技术规程，完全由我国自行设计及施工的，所用器材百分之九十以上由本国供应。因为我们在超高压送电线路工程的设计、加工、施工方面没有经验，又因时间紧迫，所以这一任务对我们来说是极为复杂而艰巨的。但由于遵照了您的教导，在中共中央东北局及上级的正确领导下，经苏联专家的具体指导与各兄弟企业及沿线县、区的党、政、农民的大力支持，我们终于克服了各种困难，胜利地提前完成了全部工程任务。
    为了迎接今后更多更艰巨的建设任务，争取更大的胜利，我们决心在您的教导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，在党及上级的领导下，高度发挥工人阶级艰苦奋斗的精神，进一步向苏联学习，努力提高政治、技术与管理水平，不骄不躁地迎接与完成国家建设计划，为实现国家社会主义工业化而奋斗！谨向您致最崇高的敬礼，并祝您万寿无疆！

            一九五四年二月十日
