    The Girl with the Soldier's Medal of Honor
    ——An Interview with Choi Bun-ok, a Female Tank Driver and Model Combatant of the Korean People's Army
  　Zhu Bo
    Have you seen the dance "Rose" performed by the Korean National Art Theater? The red flowers, set off by the green leaves, grow in the misty rain. Suddenly, a storm comes, roaring to destroy these blooming roses. However, the roses do not succumb; they unite and fight the storm. Finally, they overcome the storm and reopen in the bright sunshine after the victory. The flowers appear even more vibrant.
    When we see this beautiful dance, we cannot help but think of the heroic Korean women who, in the war against American imperialist aggression, didn’t they demonstrate their steadfast and unyielding character just like the roses fighting the storm? Now that they have won, don't their images appear even more glorious? Choi Bun-ok, a female tank driver and model combatant of the Korean People's Army, is one of the millions of heroic Korean women.
    Choi Bun-ok was born into a poor peasant family. In 1949, to defend her country and the new life after liberation, she joined the People's Army.
    In 1950, not long after she learned to work as a nurse, American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea. Like countless Korean women, she swore an oath to the motherland and wrote down her determination. She said: I will not bow my head under any difficulties. I will definitely complete the task given to me by the people of the motherland because of their trust in me. I must not let this trust down. So, she followed the People's Army in pursuing the enemy, from the 38th parallel all the way to the Nakdong River. She completed her tasks excellently in every battle.
    One day in August 1950, on a mountain peak near the riverbank, soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Army were using this high ground to monitor the fleeing enemy and provide cover for their own troops crossing the river. The dying enemy sent hundreds of planes every day, taking turns bombing the mountain peak, trying to stop the People's Army's advance.
    At that time, Choi Bun-ok was working as an assistant in a field surgery room in a valley near the front line. She worked tirelessly from morning till night every day. When night fell, she also participated in the rescue of the wounded.
    The front line was on a towering mountain peak, full of trees and rocks, with no passable road. Medical personnel had to carry the wounded on their backs. At first, everyone carried one person with three people. Choi Bun-ok thought it was too slow, so she carried one wounded person on her own.
    To complete this task required not only physical strength but also unparalleled courage, because the enemy planes did not stop bombing, and flares were dropped one after another, illuminating the mountains and fields. Choi Bun-ok boldly used the enemy's flares, carried the wounded on her back, grabbed the low-hanging branches with her hands, and stepped on the protruding stones on the mountain peak to climb back down the mountain. She worked like this until dawn, and then she went into the operating room to take on the work of an assistant. Sometimes, when she was too tired to bear it, she encouraged herself: Persevere, don't forget your oath.
    She persisted like this for seven days and seven nights, without food, water, or rest. Her rosy face turned pale, her eyes were red and swollen, and her lips were chapped and bleeding. However, her spirit was not diminished at all because she knew that she was completing the task given to her by the people of the motherland. Hard struggle brought her honor. The unit leader personally awarded her a medal of merit and announced that he would also request the Supreme People's Assembly to award her two Soldier's Medals of Honor.
    But Choi Bun-ok was not satisfied with her achievements. She often said: The Party's cause is so great, and I have done too little work. (Attached picture)

    戴着战士荣誉勋章的姑娘
    ——访朝鲜人民军坦克女司机、模范战斗员崔粉玉
  　朱波
    你看过朝鲜国立艺术剧场演出的舞蹈——“蔷薇”吗？那红色的花朵，陪衬着翠绿的叶子，在蒙蒙细雨中生长着。忽然，暴风雨来临了，它怒吼着要摧残这盛开的蔷薇，然而，蔷薇花并没有屈服，她们团结在一起和暴风雨搏斗，最后终于战胜了狂风暴雨，在胜利后的明媚的阳光下重新开放着，花朵显得更鲜艳了。
    当我们看见这个幽美的舞蹈的时候，不能不想起英雄的朝鲜妇女，她们在反对美帝国主义侵略战争中，不是正像和暴风雨搏斗的蔷薇一样，表现了她们坚贞不屈的性格吗？如今，胜利了，她们的形象不是显得更光辉了吗？朝鲜人民军坦克女司机、模范战斗员崔粉玉就是千百万英雄的朝鲜妇女中的一个。
    崔粉玉出生在一个贫农的家庭里，一九四九年，她为了保卫祖国，保卫解放后的新生活，参加了人民军。
    一九五○年，她学会作护士工作不久，美帝国主义就发动了侵朝战争。她就像无数朝鲜妇女那样，向祖国宣誓，还写下自己的决心书。她说：我在任何困难下都不低头，一定完成祖国人民因信任我而给我的任务，我一定不能辜负这种信任。于是她随着人民军追击敌人，从“三八”线一直到洛东江岸。每次战斗她都是出色地完成了任务。
    一九五○年八月里的一天，在靠近江岸的一个山峰，人民军某部战士们正利用这个高地，监视着逃跑的敌人，并掩护自己渡江的部队。垂死的敌人，每天出动千百架飞机，轮番轰炸着山峰，企图阻止人民军的进攻。
    当时，崔粉玉在临近火线的一个山谷中，担任战地手术室的助手，她每天不歇气地从早晨工作到晚上。当黑夜到来的时候，她又参加了抢救伤员的工作。
    火线在高耸的山峰上，满山都是树林和乱石，没有一条可以通行的道路。医务人员不得不采取背的办法来抢救伤员。开始，大家都是三个人背一个，崔粉玉嫌这样太慢，她就一人背一个伤员。
    为了完成这一任务不仅需要体力，还需要无比的勇敢，因为敌人的飞机并没停止轰炸，照明弹一个接一个地投下来，照亮了山野，崔粉玉就大胆地利用敌人的照明弹，背起伤员，手攀着低垂的树枝，脚蹬着山峰上突出的石头，从山上爬回来。就这样一直工作到天亮，她又钻进手术室担负起助手的工作。有时她疲倦得实在支持不住了，她就鼓舞自己：坚持下去，不要忘记自己的誓言。
    她这样一连坚持了七天七夜，得不到饭吃，得不到水喝，也得不到休息。她那红润的面孔变得苍白了，两只眼睛也红肿起来了，嘴唇干裂得流出鲜血，但是，她的精神一点都没有减弱，因为她知道，她正在完成祖国人民给她的任务。艰苦斗争换来了荣誉，部队首长亲自把军功章授给她，并且宣布：还要呈请最高人民会议颁发给她两枚战士荣誉勋章。
    可是崔粉玉并不满足自己的成就。她常常这样说：党的事业是那么大，自己工作得太少了。（附图片）
