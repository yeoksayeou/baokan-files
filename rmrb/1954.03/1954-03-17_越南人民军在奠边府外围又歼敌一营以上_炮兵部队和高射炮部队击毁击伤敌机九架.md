Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese People's Army, while attacking the enemy's most fortified position at Him Lam outside Dien Bien Phu on March 13th, began shelling and attacking two other enemy positions outside Dien Bien Phu, namely Muong Thanh and Doc Lap Hill. In three days of fighting, they annihilated another enemy battalion or more and shot down or damaged three enemy aircraft on the battlefield.

On the afternoon of March 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army shelled the enemy position at Muong Thanh, destroying many fortifications and killing or wounding 150 enemy soldiers, including French Colonel Commander Hautecoeur and two captains. On the 14th, the Vietnamese People's Army shelled 300 paratroopers airdropped by the enemy in the rice fields of the Muong Thanh area, killing a portion of them. On the same day, the Vietnamese People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery units shot down a French reconnaissance plane on the battlefield, and two other fighter-bombers were hit and caught fire.

At 5:00 PM on March 14th, the Vietnamese People's Army began shelling Doc Lap Hill, a fortified French stronghold three kilometers north of Muong Thanh. At 2:00 AM on the 15th, infantry began attacking the enemy, and after fierce fighting until 7:00 AM, they completely occupied Doc Lap Hill. The entire 5th Battalion of the 7th North African Regiment defending the hill was annihilated. At the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army repelled an enemy battalion coming to rescue the Doc Lap Hill garrison, destroying one enemy tank.

In the three days from March 13th to 15th, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated more than two enemy battalions outside Dien Bien Phu. Among them, the enemy lost a total of 632 men in the battle of Him Lam on the 13th, including one major, four captains, and many officers and sergeants.

After capturing the Him Lam stronghold, the Vietnamese People's Army carefully treated the wounded enemy soldiers and notified the French commander of Dien Bien Phu, De Castries, to transport the wounded French soldiers back. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy sent ambulances to Him Lam to transport the wounded soldiers back to Dien Bien Phu. This action of releasing wounded enemy prisoners of war on the spot once again proves the lenient policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th. A military reporter from Vietnam News Agency reported from the Dien Bien Phu front on the Vietnamese People's Army's attack on the enemy near Dien Bien Phu on March 13th:

Dien Bien Phu has a cluster of French strongholds dotted with bunkers, defended by thirteen enemy mobile battalions composed of over ten thousand elite troops. The enemy is stationed in three military sectors: seven battalions in the main military sector, three battalions in the southern military sector, and another three battalions in the northern military sector. All three military sectors are located on the Muong Thanh Plain, which is about ten kilometers long. Defending this stronghold are also many M24 heavy tanks, more than forty heavy artillery pieces, 155mm and 105mm caliber cannons, and 120mm caliber mortars.

To supply the besieged Dien Bien Phu with weapons, ammunition, and food, the enemy relies entirely on two large airfields capable of handling heavy aircraft located in the main and southern military sectors. These airfields are constantly filled with transport planes, reconnaissance planes, and fighter-bombers.

On the afternoon of March 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army heavily shelled Muong Thanh, an important stronghold commanding the two French airfields and artillery positions. As the People's Army launched its attack, eight enemy fighter-bombers flew in to join the battle, but due to the bombardment by the People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery units, they dared not fly low and dropped two bombs haphazardly before flying away.

The Vietnamese People's Army infantry units, in coordination with the fierce artillery fire of the anti-aircraft artillery units, launched an attack on Him Lam, an important enemy stronghold in the northeast of Dien Bien Phu, covering the main military sector's positions. The main force defending this stronghold was the 3rd Battalion of the Foreign Legion, as well as a company of Thai puppet troops. The stronghold was built with many fortifications, bunkers, and barbed wire. After two hours of fighting, the People's Army first destroyed the two strongholds in the northeast and southwest. Later, the People's Army attacked the third stronghold in the northwest, where the 3rd Battalion headquarters was also located. The two sides fought fiercely until 11:00 PM, when the Vietnamese People's Army completely removed the Him Lam stronghold, killing or wounding 632 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnamese People's Army continued to shell the enemy airport around Dien Bien Phu, destroying another six enemy aircraft.

At 9:00 AM on March 13th, the People's Army artillery units hit a French Dakota aircraft at the Dien Bien Phu airport. At noon, a French Hellcat fighter-bomber was hit and caught fire, and another Hellcat aircraft and a Dakota aircraft were heavily damaged. At 4:00 PM, another Hellcat aircraft was destroyed. At 2:30 PM on the same day, the People's Army artillery units shelled the newly built French airfield at Hong Khou, four kilometers south of Dien Bien Phu, and a Dakota aircraft caught fire. In total, six French aircraft were destroyed on the 13th alone. Prior to this, the People's Army artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units had destroyed and shot down a total of six enemy aircraft around Dien Bien Phu on the 11th and 12th.

The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army has awarded the units that destroyed enemy aircraft on the 13th with the Third Class Military Merit Medal.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th. According to Vietnam News Agency on the 13th: The Vietnamese military and civilians in the Tuy Hoa area of central Vietnam annihilated 915 enemies in 40 days and recently severely damaged an enemy transport convoy.

Since the French invading army landed on the coast of the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen Province in the liberated zone of central Vietnam, it has tried to expand its occupied area and carry out conscription and plunder of the people's property. However, the enemy's advance has met with stubborn resistance from the Vietnamese military and civilians in the Tuy Hoa area, suffering heavy losses. The Vietnamese military and civilians in the Tuy Hoa area annihilated a total of 915 enemy soldiers in the forty days from January 20th to February 28th.

On March 7th, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in the Tuy Hoa area ambushed an enemy transport convoy of 28 trucks escorted by a European-African company on a highway 30 kilometers northwest of Tuy Hoa. After 15 minutes of battle, they completely destroyed 26 enemy trucks, killed most of the enemy soldiers, and captured 28 enemies. These enemy soldiers belonged to the 3rd European-African Battalion of the 10th Mobile Group; the 10th Mobile Group was an elite unit used by the enemy in the amphibious landing in the Tuy Hoa area.

    越南人民军在奠边府外围又歼敌一营以上
    炮兵部队和高射炮部队击毁击伤敌机九架
   【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军在三月十三日进攻奠边府外围防御最巩固的敌军阵地兴垄的同时，开始炮轰和攻击奠边府外围的另外两个敌军阵地孟清和独立高地，在三天战斗中又歼敌一营以上，并在战地击落、击伤敌机三架。
    三月十三日下午，越南人民军炮轰敌军阵地孟清，击毁了许多防御工事，并击毙和击伤敌军一百五十名，其中有法军上校指挥官奥契特和两名上尉。十四日，越南人民军炮击敌人空投在孟清地区稻田的三百名伞兵，击毙其中的一部分。同一天，越南人民军高射炮部队在战地击落法军侦察机一架，另两架战斗轰炸机被击中着火。
    三月十四日下午五时，越南人民军开始用炮火轰击孟清以北三公里的法军强固据点——独立高地。十五日清晨二时，步兵开始向敌军发动攻击，激战至早晨七时，完全占领独立高地。防守这高地的部队——第七北非团所属第五营全部被歼灭。越南人民军同时并击退前来援救独立高地守军的敌军一个营，击毁敌军坦克一辆。
    自三月十三日至十五日的三天中，越南人民军在奠边府外围共已歼灭敌军两个营以上。其中敌人在十三日兴垄的战斗中共损失六百三十二名，包括少校一名、上尉四名以及许多军官和军士。
    越南人民军在拔除兴垄据点后，小心地为受伤的敌军医治，并通知奠边府的法军司令德卡斯特莱把法军伤兵运回。十五日早晨，敌人派来救护车到兴垄把伤兵运回奠边府。这种就地释放敌方受伤战俘的行动，再一次证明越南民主共和国的宽大政策。
    【新华社十六日讯】越南通讯社军事记者自奠边府前线报道越南人民军十三日在奠边府附近攻击敌军的经过说：
    奠边府有着成群的碉堡密布的法军据点，它们由一万多名精锐部队组成的十三个敌军机动营防守着。敌军分驻在三个军分区：七个营驻在主要军分区；三个营驻在南部的军分区；另外三个营驻在北部的军分区。三个军分区都位于孟清平原上，长约十公里。防守这个据点的还有许多M二十四型的重型坦克，四十多门重炮，一百五十五公厘和一百零五公厘口径的大炮和一百二十公厘口径的迫击炮。
    为了供应被包围的奠边府武器、弹药和粮食，敌人完全要依靠设在主要军分区和南部军分区的两个可以起落重型飞机的大机场，这两个机场上经常停放着许多架运输机、侦察机和战斗轰炸机。
    三月十三日下午，越南人民军以大炮猛烈轰击孟清——指挥两个法军机场和大炮阵地的重要据点。在人民军发动攻击时，先后有八架敌军战斗轰炸机飞来参加战斗，但是由于人民军高射炮部队的轰击，它们不敢低飞，胡乱投了两颗炸弹后就飞走了。
    越南人民军步兵部队在高射炮部队猛烈炮火的配合下，向奠边府东北掩护着主要军分区阵地的敌军重要据点兴垄发动进攻。守卫这个据点的敌军主力部队是外籍军团第三营，另外还有一连泰族伪军。据点内筑有许多防御工事、碉堡和铁丝网。经过两小时的战斗，人民军首先摧毁了东北和西南两个据点。后来，人民军又进攻西北的第三个据点，第三营营部也在那里。双方激战到晚上十一时，越南人民军完全拔除了兴垄据点，杀伤敌军六百三十二名。
   【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军继续在奠边府周围炮击敌军机场，又击毁敌机六架。
    三月十三日上午九时，人民军炮兵部队击中奠边府机场的一架法军达科他式飞机。中午，一架法军恶猫式战斗轰炸机中弹起火，另一架恶猫式飞机和一架达科他式飞机受重伤。下午四时又击毁一架恶猫式飞机。当天下午二时半，人民军炮兵部队向奠边府以南四公里的鸿库地方新建的法军机场轰击，一架达科他式飞机着火。总计在十三日一天之内共击毁法军飞机六架。在这以前，人民军炮兵和高射炮部队已于十一日和十二日在奠边府周围击毁和击落敌机共六架。
  　越南人民军总司令部已以三级军功章授予十三日击毁敌机有功的部队。
     【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社十三日讯：中越南部绥和地区的越南军民在四十天中歼敌九百
  一十五名，并在最近重创敌军运输车队。
    法国侵略军自在中越南部解放区的富安省绥和地区的海岸登陆后，力图扩大占领区，并进行抓丁和掠夺人民财物。但是敌人的进犯遭到绥和地区的越南军民的顽强抵抗，蒙受了重大损失。绥和地区的越南军民在从一月二十日到二月二十八日的四十天中，共歼灭敌军九百一十五名。
  　三月七日，绥和地区的越南人民武装在绥和西北三十公里的公路上伏击一队由一个欧非连护送的、由二十八辆卡车组成的敌军运输车队，经过十五分钟战斗，彻底击毁了敌军卡车二十六辆，击毙敌军大部，并俘敌二十八名。这些敌军隶属于第十机动团第三欧非营；第十机动团是敌军在绥和地区进行两栖登陆时使用的精锐部队。
