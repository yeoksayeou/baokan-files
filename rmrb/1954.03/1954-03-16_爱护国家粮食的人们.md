    People Who Cherish National Grain
    Not Letting Snow Water Dampen the Nation's Grain
    Jing Guilian, a 78-year-old woman from Shangduan Village, Third District, Anyi County, Shanxi Province, has always cherished the public grain stored in her home by the state as if it were her own. She carefully sealed the cracks in the granary door with cloth strips to prevent pests from entering. In December of last year, when Anyi County was conducting grain storage work, due to insufficient granary space, eleven bags of millet (totaling over 2,300 catties) were temporarily piled under the eaves outside the granary. Unexpectedly, a heavy snow fell. Jing Guilian, who lived in the granary courtyard, fearing that the melted snow would dampen the grain, covered the grain with her own kang mat and quilt. When the county grain bureau work team inspected and discovered that Jing Guilian, in the severe winter, was able to spare a quilt to protect the nation's grain, preventing it from getting damp, they immediately expressed their sympathy. She said cordially, "The quilt can be dried if it gets wet, but if the grain gets wet, the state's property will suffer a loss. This is what I should do."
    On February 7th of this year, the Anyi County People's Government held a meritorious service conference to reward Jing, the model grain protector. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government also awarded her a certificate and prizes; the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office awarded her a banner. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government also issued a notice throughout the province commending Jing Guilian's exemplary action of cherishing national grain.
    Rescuing Grain in the Face of Fierce Wind and Rain
    Qin Fuxiang is a grain custodian at the Grain Experiment Depot of the Xingtai Special District Grain Bureau in Hebei Province. In his four years of grain custody work, he has consistently protected the nation's grain, preventing it from being damaged.
    One afternoon in July of last year, while he was helping workers sweep up grain from the ground, the weather suddenly changed, with a fierce wind followed by a torrential rain. Qin Fuxiang, thinking that the mats on the open-air grain stacks might be blown away by the wind, braved the rain and ran towards the stacks. As he expected, the mats on some of the stacks had been blown open by the wind. He carried a ladder and a sewing needle and climbed onto the stacks. Because the wind was too strong to stand firmly, he climbed up and fell down repeatedly, finally managing to get up after three attempts. In this fierce wind and rain, he persisted for over an hour, working with other comrades to secure over forty dangerous grain stacks, preventing the grain from being damaged. During his rest periods, he often helped the female workers at the warehouse sweep up the grain on the ground, saying, "Even a single grain damaged is a loss to the nation and the people." Because of his conscientious and responsible grain custody, he was recognized as a work model and has been repeatedly commended by higher authorities.
      Covering Grain with a Woolen Blanket
    Wang Azhao, a 70-year-old relative of an overseas Chinese in Peikeng Village, Shishi Town, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, lent her warehouse to the state for storing grain. One day in August of last year, when the custodian had moved 30,000 catties of rice out to dry, a sudden wind and rainstorm struck. Seeing that the custodian alone could not rescue the grain in time, Wang immediately covered the rice with her own woolen blanket, mosquito net, and flower mat, and quickly blocked the windows and doors of the warehouse. At this time, neighbors also rushed to help rescue the grain, allowing it to be moved back into the warehouse in time, preventing any loss. She said, "The People's Government takes such good care of us overseas Chinese relatives, how can I not protect the nation's grain well?" Wang Azhao's exemplary action was praised by the Shishi Grain Depot.
    The Achievements of a Demobilized Soldier
    Last spring, the surface of the grain piles in the Beijie Grain Depot in Xinyi County, Guangdong Province, was covered with dust, marked with obvious rat footprints and bird claws, and the grain suffered from a serious insect infestation. By the autumn grain purchase season last year, the Beijie Grain Depot had completely changed its appearance. The weeds outside the warehouse were cleared away, the window frames and doors of the ventilation holes were wiped clean, there were no cobwebs inside the warehouse, and the grain rarely suffered from mold or insect damage. Why was this possible? This is inseparable from the hard work of the warehouse director, Lü Tianli.
    Lü Tianli is a demobilized soldier. Although he had been wounded in many battles and was not in good health, he still often took the lead in holding a hoe and broom, sweeping the inside and outside of the warehouse, and working actively while working at the Beijie Grain Depot. The daily morning and afternoon inspection system and the "small inspection every three days, large inspection every seven days" system were gradually established. He didn't understand the business at first, but he was able to learn humbly, and gradually understood what he didn't understand. He saw that the space under the platform was full of spilled grain, which needed to be cleaned out, but the passage was long and narrow, making it difficult to do. He used small pieces of wood to install on a long bamboo pole, making a small grain scraper, and squatted at the entrance to slowly clean it up. In this way, he turned a bad warehouse into a good one.
      Carefully Inspecting the Warehouse
    Wu Chuan'nian is the leader of the grain storage team of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Sixteenth District of Huangpi County, Hubei Province. Because he often carefully inspects every grain warehouse and cherishes the nation's grain as if it were his own eyes, the grain he has kept has never suffered from mold.
    In addition to adhering to regular inspections, whenever it rains or the weather changes suddenly, he carefully checks whether the roof tiles and walls are leaking. When he finds that the temperature of the rice has increased, he mobilizes everyone to spread the rice into several wave-like grain trenches to allow the rice to ventilate and lower the temperature. Some time ago, there was heavy snow, and some civilian houses had snow leaking from the eaves, and there was thick snow next to the rice stacks, but the open space around the stacks was too small for people to crawl in and shovel the snow. Seeing that the weather was clearing and the snow was about to melt, and the grain would be damaged, in this emergency, they came up with the idea of using a long-handled rake to rake out the snow; at the same time, they also put some dry soil and soil brick powder into the side of the stacks to absorb the melted snow, and then rake out the wet soil, so that the rice could avoid being damp.
    Bringing the Strength of the Porters into Play
    On the night of February 13th, the sky was gloomy, and it looked like it was about to rain. At this time, farmers in Baoxin, Dongyue, and other districts of Xixian County, Henan Province, were transporting grain to the city by cart. When the workers of the Xixian County Porters' Union learned of this situation, they were all very worried. One worker said: The peasant brothers sell their surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction, and we cannot let the grain suffer the slightest loss. We should go out to meet the peasant brothers immediately. This suggestion was supported by all the porters. So, they lit gasoline lamps and horse lanterns and went outside the city to meet the peasant brothers, like lighting lanterns on the night of the Lantern Festival.
    As soon as the grain arrived at the warehouse gate in the city, snow mixed with rain began to fall. The porters helped the farmers rush to put the grain into the warehouse. In this way, the workers and peasant brothers worked all night in the wind and snow, so that all the grain was safely put into the warehouse.
    Rescuing Grain by Jumping into the Water
    On January 15th of this year, two bamboo rafts carrying more than 3,000 catties of rice and a bamboo raft carrying tiles from the Shaxi Grain Depot in Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province, were traveling side by side towards Baisha. When the bamboo rafts reached Baiku Village, Jishui County, because the river surface was narrow and the water flow was rapid, one of the bamboo rafts carrying more than 1,600 catties of grain was overturned by the bamboo raft carrying tiles and pressed under the tile raft, and all the grain fell into the water. At that time, the weather was very cold, and it was raining lightly. When Li Zhengfu and Gong Duliang, the warehouse cadres of the Baiku Village grain purchasing point, discovered this situation, they jumped into the water to rescue the grain, and as a result, they salvaged about 1,100 catties of rice from the bottom of the river. When the masses saw them rescuing grain regardless of danger, they also jumped into the water to salvage the grain, and salvaged another 100 catties or so. Under their enthusiastic rescue, the state's property suffered less loss.

    爱护国家粮食的人们
    不让雪水淋湿了国家的粮食
    山西省安邑县第三区上段村七十八岁的景贵莲老大娘，对于国家寄放在她家的公粮，从来都是像自己的粮食一样地爱护。他把粮库的门缝都用布条严密地糊起来，防止害虫飞进去。去年十二月间，安邑县进行粮食入库工作时，由于粮库不够使用，把十一袋小米（共二千三百余斤），暂时堆放在粮库外边的屋檐下，不料下了一场大雪，住在粮库院里的景贵莲老大娘，怕溶化了的雪水淋湿了粮食，便用自己的炕席和被子把粮食盖起来。当县粮食局工作组检查时，发现景贵莲老大娘，在严寒的冬天里，能抽出一条被子来遮护国家的粮食，使粮食没有受到潮湿的爱国行动后，就马上对她进行了慰问。她亲切地说：“被子淋湿了，一晒就干，粮食淋湿了，国家财产就要受损失，这是我应该做的事。”
    今年二月七日，安邑县人民政府举行了贺功大会，奖励护粮模范景老大娘。山西省人民政府还奖给她奖状、奖品；运城专员公署奖给了她一面锦旗。山西省人民政府并通报全省表扬景贵莲老大娘爱护国家粮食的模范行动。
    冒着狂风骤雨抢救粮食
    秦福祥是河北省邢台专区粮食管理局粮食试验库的粮食保管员。他在四年的粮食保管工作岗位上，始终如一地保护着国家的粮食，不使粮食受到损坏。
    去年七月的一天下午，他正在帮助工人打扫地上的粮食，天气突然变化，起了一阵狂风，接着就来了暴雨。秦福祥想起了露天粮垛，恐怕被风把席子刮开，就冒着大雨跑向粮垛。果然不出他所料，有的粮垛的席被风刮开了，他扛了梯子，拿着缝针爬上垛去，因为风大站不住，爬上去摔下来，一连三次才上去了。在这狂风骤雨中，他坚持了一个多钟头，和其他同志一块把四十多个危险的粮垛都收拾好了，使粮食没有受到损失。他休息时，还经常帮助仓库女工去扫掉在地上的粮食，他说：“一粒粮食损坏了，也是对国家对人民的损失。”因为他这样认真负责的保管粮食，他被评为工作模范；受到了上级屡次的表扬。
      把毛毯盖在粮食上
    福建省晋江县石狮镇培坑村七十岁的侨属王阿招将仓房借给国家放粮。去年八月间有一天，保管员搬了三万斤稻谷出来晒，忽然风雨大作，王老大娘见保管员一人抢救不及，马上把自己的毛毯、蚊帐、花席等盖在谷子上面，并赶紧堵塞仓房窗门。这时邻居们也都赶来协助抢救，使这些谷子及时收进仓房，未受损失。她说：“人民政府对我们侨属照顾得这么好，国家的粮食我怎么能不好好保护呢？”王阿招的模范行动，受到了石狮粮库的表扬。
    转业军人的功绩
    去年春天，广东省信宜县北界粮仓的粮堆面上布满了灰尘，印着显明的鼠脚雀爪，粮食发生了严重的害虫。到去年秋谷收购期中，北界粮仓却完全改变了过去的样子，仓外野草铲除得很干净，通风洞的窗框窗门，揩抹得很干净，仓内完全没有蜘蛛网，粮食很少发生霉坏和虫害。为什么能这样呢？这是和仓库主任吕天立的努力工作是分不开的。
    吕天立是一个转业军人。他虽然在多年战斗中受过伤，身体不好，可是在北界粮仓工作时，仍然经常带头拿着锄头扫把，打扫仓内外，积极工作。每天上下午的检查制度和“三天一小检、七日一大检”的制度也逐渐建立起来了。他开始不懂得业务，但他能虚心学习，不懂的也逐渐懂得了。他看见地台下面漏满谷子，要清扫出来，但是通路又长又窄不好办，他就利用小木片安装在一根长竹上，做成一个小谷扒，蹲在洞口慢慢地清理。就这样，使一个坏仓库变成了好仓库。
      细心检查仓库
    吴传年是湖北省黄陂县十六区供销合作社粮食保管小组的小组长，由于他经常细致地检查每一个粮食仓库，像爱护自己的眼睛一样地爱护国家的粮食，所以经他保管过的粮食，从来没有发生过霉烂现象。
    他除了坚持定期检查外，每遇下雨或天气骤然变化时，就细心检查屋瓦、墙壁是否漏水。发现了稻谷热度增高时，就动员大家把稻谷扒成几条波浪式的谷沟，使稻谷透风降低温度。前些时下了大雪，有的民房檐边漏雪，稻谷囤子旁边有很厚的雪，可是囤子周围的空地太小，人不能钻进去扒雪，眼看天晴雪化，粮食要受到损失。在这个紧急的情况下，他们想出了用长柄扒子把雪扒出来；同时又弄了一些干土、土砖沫倒入囤子旁边，以吸收溶雪水分，然后再把湿土扒出，使稻谷避免了受潮湿。
    发挥搬运工人的力量
    二月十三日的深夜，天阴沉沉的，眼看就要下雨。这时河南息县包信、东岳等区的农民，正在用大车往城里运粮食。当息县搬运工会的工人们知道这个情况后，大家都很着急。有一个工人说：农民兄弟把余粮卖给国家，为的是支援国家的工业建设，我们可不能让粮食受到一点损失，应当马上去迎接农民弟兄。这一建议，得到了全体搬运工人的拥护。于是，就点起了汽灯和马提灯，像正月十五日晚上出灯一样，到城外去迎接农民弟兄们。
    粮食刚到城内仓库门口，雪夹着雨就下起来了。搬运工人们帮助农民抢着把粮食入库。就这样工人和农民兄弟在风雪中工作了一夜，使全部粮食安然的入了库。
    下水抢救粮食
    今年一月十五日，江西省永丰县沙溪粮库有两只竹筏载运三千余斤稻谷和一只运瓦的竹筏并排运向白沙。竹筏行至吉水县百库村时，因江面狭水流急，其中一只装载一千六百多斤谷子的竹筏，被运瓦的竹筏碰翻，压在瓦筏下面，谷子全部倒入水中。当时天气很冷，还下着小雨，这时百库村粮食收购点仓库干部李正福和龚都良发现这个情况后，就下水抢救，结果从江底捞起了约有一千一百多斤稻谷。群众看到他们这样不怕危险抢救粮食，也下水去捞，又捞起了一百多斤。在他们热心的抢救下，使国家财产少受了损失。
