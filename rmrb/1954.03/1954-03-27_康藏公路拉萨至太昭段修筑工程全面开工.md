Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 26th: Full-scale construction of the Lhasa-Tachao section of the Kangzang Highway began in mid-March. Tens of thousands of Tibetan laborers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and engineering technicians from the interior of the motherland are scattered along the hundreds of miles of construction line, battling against the treacherous high mountains and turbulent rivers. The sound of explosions blasting rocks echoes through the valleys like spring thunder. Medical personnel from the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and staff members from the state-owned Tibet Trading General Company have arrived at the construction site to provide services.

The construction project for the Lhasa-Tachao section this year is planned in two phases. The construction section of the first phase project has already crossed the Daxueshan Mountain, which is over 5,000 meters above sea level, and entered the river valley covered with forests. After the second phase project is completed, the highway will pass through Tachao and connect with the eastward-extending highway in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. The engineering quantity of this construction plan is double the amount of construction last year; it also includes key projects such as erecting more than ten bridges and blasting more than one hundred thousand cubic meters of hard rock.

The laborers, soldiers, and engineering technicians participating in the road construction have expressed unparalleled confidence and determination to complete this year's road construction task. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are bravely taking the lead in the road construction project, have undertaken the most arduous tasks. Before the construction, each squad, platoon, and company wrote letters of determination to their superiors, unanimously proposing: "Use our best efforts to ensure that the highway to Lhasa opens to traffic as soon as possible." More than 40 Tibetan laborers from the Zong and Xika of Tibet gathered at the construction site immediately after the Tibetan New Year in order to start the highway construction ahead of schedule, and held a get-together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the construction site.

Due to the vastness of the construction project, the support transportation work is also becoming increasingly busy. From the end of last autumn to this spring, thousands of yaks, mules, and camels have been continuously transporting large quantities of materials to the construction site. Now, thousands of tons of rice, flour, zanba, canned food, explosives, and various road construction tools are being transported to the construction site from Sichuan, Qinghai, and various parts of Tibet. In order to further improve the support work, the Tibetan local government prepared a large amount of purchased grain and materials last winter. Daiben Xiajiang Suoba led nearly 2,000 Tibetan laborers in January this year, braving wind and snow to fell and transport road construction timber in a certain forest area. When the road construction troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Mozhugongka and Lamu and other places set off, the local people automatically organized five or six hundred livestock to send the troops to the construction site. The Tibetan people in the villages along the construction area cleaned their houses long ago in preparation for the road construction troops to live in.

[Another Dispatch] The Tibetan and Han workers in the factories affiliated to the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are working selflessly to manufacture a large number of equipment and tools to support the construction of the Kangzang Highway. From December last year to February this year, the workers in the iron and wood factory have manufactured more than 40,000 pieces of bridge equipment and road construction tools for the Kangzang Highway. These equipment and tools have been successively transported to the construction area before the start of construction; now a batch of equipment is transported from the factory to the construction site every other day. Workers in the leather factory and wool spinning factory are rushing to make various leather goods and moisture-proof and warm sheepskin felt for the road construction troops. Workers in the clothing factory are also rushing to make various quilts and clothes suitable for the climate of various construction areas.

    康藏公路拉萨至太昭段修筑工程全面开工
    【新华社拉萨二十六日电】康藏公路拉萨至太昭段修筑工程已在三月中旬全面开工。数以万计的藏族民工、人民解放军战士和来自祖国内地的工程技术人员，分布在几百里长的施工线上，和艰险的高山岩石及奔腾汹涌的河流搏斗。爆炸岩石的炮声像春雷一样地震荡着山谷。人民解放军西藏军区派到工地的医务人员和国营西藏贸易总公司的工作人员已先后到达工地服务。
    今年拉萨到太昭段的修筑工程，计划分两期进行。现在第一期工程计划的施工地段，已越过拔海五千多公尺的大雪山，进入满布森林的河谷地带；等第二期工程结束后，公路将穿过太昭，在雅鲁藏布江下游地区和东段向西延伸的公路接连。这个施工计划的工程数量，较去年全年施工数量增多了一倍；其中还包括架设十多座桥梁和爆炸十几万立方公尺坚石的重点工程。
    参加筑路的民工、战士和工程技术人员，对完成今年的筑路任务，表示了无比坚强的信心和决心。在筑路工程中奋勇当先的人民解放军的战士们，承担了工程中最艰巨的任务，施工前各个班、排、连都向上级写了决心书，一致提出：“用最大努力，争取公路早日通车拉萨”。西藏地区四十多个宗和溪卡的藏族民工，为了使公路提前开工，一过完藏历春节，就集拢到工地，在工地上和人民解放军战士举行了联欢会。
    由于修筑工程的浩大，支援运输工作也日益繁忙。从去年秋末到今年春天，成千的牦牛、骡马和骆驼，源源向工地运送大批物资。现在，上千吨的大米、白面、糌粑、罐头、炸药和各种筑路工具，从四川、青海和西藏各地运到工地。西藏地方政府为进一步做好支援工作，去年冬天就把代购的大批粮食和物资筹办齐全。代本夏江苏巴今年一月曾带领近两千藏族民工，冒着风雪到某地森林区伐运筑路木材。驻墨竹工卡和拉木等地的人民解放军修路部队在出发时，当地人民并自动组织了五六百头牲口，把部队送到工地去。施工区沿线各个村庄的藏族人民，很早就把房子打扫得干干净净，准备让修路部队居住。
   【又讯】人民解放军西藏军区所属各工厂的藏、汉族工人，正以忘我的劳动为支援康藏公路的修筑制造大批器材和工具。铁木工厂工人从去年十二月到今年二月已为康藏公路制造了四万多件桥梁器材和筑路工具，这些器材工具已在开工前陆续运到施工地区；现在每隔一天就有一批器材从工厂运往工地。皮革工厂和毛纺厂的工人们正在为筑路部队赶制各种皮件和防潮保暖的羊皮毡。被服工厂工人也在赶制适合各施工地区气候的各种被子和衣服。
