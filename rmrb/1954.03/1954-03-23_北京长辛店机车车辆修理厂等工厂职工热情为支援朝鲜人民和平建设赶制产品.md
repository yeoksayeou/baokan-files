Xinhua News Agency Report: Workers in factories such as the Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory in Beijing, the Beijing Bureau of Weights and Measures Factory, the Beijing People's Machine General Factory, the Beijing Enamel Factory, and the Beijing Metal Casting Factory are enthusiastically rushing to produce a batch of goods to support the Korean people in their reconstruction efforts. These products include freight cars, concrete mixers, stone screening machines, sand screening machines, rubber-wheeled carts, enamel bathtubs, canvas mailbags, and balances needed for restoration work in Korea.

The Changxindian Railway Vehicle Repair Factory is tasked with repairing thirty-one freight cars and guard cars for the Korean people in the first quarter's repair work. Upon receiving the task, the workers in the freight car workshop immediately proposed to do everything possible to complete this glorious mission. On the afternoon of accepting the task of renovating eight guard cars, the cutting and material requisition work area rushed to prepare the materials for the eight guard cars before 5:30 PM. Subsequently, all the workers in the mounting work area also completed the mounting work. All work areas freed up time to help with riveting. Liu Lu, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" strike and a cutting work area leader, along with two foremen, riveted one car after completing the daily plan. The workers proposed to strive to complete the renovation of this batch of freight cars and guard cars ahead of schedule. The Beijing Bureau of Weights and Measures Factory received the task in January to manufacture precision analytical balances, platform balances, and two types of verification weights for health agencies, industrial, and mining enterprises in Korea. The factory's Chinese Communist Party organization, trade union, and Communist Youth League organization immediately proposed: To ensure product quality, all employees are required to achieve four "goods": select good materials; make good tools and templates; operate well; and inspect well. The workers responded to this call with great internationalist enthusiasm. In order to ensure that the products were free of sand holes, the workers in the foundry workshop switched to using dry molds for sand molds and used pure copper as raw material. The mechanics workshop also selected the workers with the highest technical skills to make this batch of products. Now the precision chemical analysis balances have all been completed. The platform balances and two types of verification weights that the workers are manufacturing will also be completed ahead of the scheduled delivery date. On March 20th, all employees also wrote a letter to the visiting Korean People's Delegation, stating: We felt infinitely honored upon receiving the task of producing materials to assist the Korean people in their construction. We guarantee to support our heroic Korean brothers with products of the highest quality. The large bathtubs made by the local state-owned Beijing Enamel Factory for the Korean people are newly developed products that they have just successfully trial-produced. After accepting this order, the factory's employees felt very honored to undertake this task, and proposed not only to deliver the goods on time but also to ensure good quality. The Beijing Metal Casting Factory is rushing to produce rubber-wheeled carts, and the factory's engineer, Du Binwu, designed a method to install automobile wheel brakes onto the cart wheels to make them suitable for mountainous terrain in Korea.
