Xinhua News Agency report: DPRK Vice Premier Hong Myong-hui published an article in "Pravda" stating that the economic and cultural mutual assistance agreement between the DPRK and the Soviet Union is the first equal international agreement in the history of the Korean people. This agreement has had, and continues to have, great political, economic, and cultural significance for the Korean people. It is a reliable guarantee for the victorious construction of a happy new life in North Korea. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union has provided, and continues to provide, great assistance and support to North Korea, helping it engage in economic and cultural construction.

Hong Myong-hui cited many examples to illustrate how this fraternal assistance, along with the help of China and other people's democratic countries, has contributed to the smooth development of various sectors of the DPRK's national economy.

Hong Myong-hui went on to say that the relationships between countries in the imperialist camp are completely different. This can be seen in the relationship between the United States and South Korea. The American occupiers in South Korea have eliminated all the political rights of the people, completely destroyed its national economy, and brought the South Korean people to the brink of starvation and destitution.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States continues to implement its plan to plunder South Korea and turn it into a military springboard for aggression against the people of Asia.

Hong Myong-hui also emphasized that the entire Korean people unanimously support the decision of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to convene the Geneva Conference, and hope that the participants will find a common basis for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Xinhua News Agency report: "Izvestia" published an article by DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Korean Economic and Cultural Mutual Assistance Agreement, titled: "Our Friendship is Permanent and Unshakable."

Nam Il reviewed the DPRK's situation in restoring its economy, which had been devastated by war. He said that with the fraternal and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, the Korean people have made significant achievements in peaceful construction in the seven months since the armistice.

Finally, Nam Il, on behalf of the Korean people, thanked the Soviet Union for protecting their interests in the international arena. The decision made by the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to convene the Geneva Conference on April 26 is a great achievement. This conference, with representatives from the five major powers as well as the DPRK and other relevant countries, will certainly help to peacefully resolve the Korean issue (which the Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world have long hoped for) - if the participants in the Geneva Conference respect the legitimate interests of the Asian people, especially the Korean people.

### 朝鲜洪命熹副首相和南日外务相分别撰文  感谢苏联帮助朝鲜从事经济和文化建设

    朝鲜洪命熹副首相和南日外务相分别撰文
    感谢苏联帮助朝鲜从事经济和文化建设
    据新华社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国副首相洪命熹在“真理报”发表文章说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与苏联之间的经济文化互助协定，是朝鲜人民历史上第一个平等的国际协定。这个协定对朝鲜人民一直、并且仍然有着很大的政治、经济和文化意义，它是朝鲜北部胜利建设幸福的新生活的可靠保证。根据这个协定，苏联已经供给，并且还在供给朝鲜很大的援助和支持，帮助朝鲜从事经济和文化建设。
    洪命熹举出了许多例子来说明这种兄弟般的援助以及中国和人民民主国家的帮助有助于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国民经济各部门的顺利发展。
    洪命熹接着说，帝国主义阵营国家间的关系就完全不同了。这可以从美国和南朝鲜之间的关系中看出来。美国占领者在南朝鲜取消了人民所有的政治权利，完全破坏了它的国民经济，并使南朝鲜人民濒于饥饿和穷困的边缘。
    在朝鲜停战协定签订以后，美国还继续实施掠夺南朝鲜、把它变成侵略亚洲人民的军事跳板的计划。
    洪命熹并强调说，朝鲜全体人民一致拥护柏林四国外长会议关于召开日内瓦会议的决议，并希望参加会议的人将找出和平解决朝鲜问题的共同基础。
    据新华社讯：“消息报”在苏朝经济文化互助协定签订五周年之际登载了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日的一篇文章，题为：“我们的友谊永久不渝”。
    南日回顾了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国恢复遭受战争破坏的经济的情况。他说，在苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的兄弟般的、无私的援助下，朝鲜人民在停战后七个月中，在和平建设方面取得了重大的成就。
    最后，南日代表朝鲜人民感谢苏联在国际场合中保护了他们的利益。柏林四国外长会议所作出的在四月二十六日召开日内瓦会议的决议是一个很大的成就。有五大国代表以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和其他有关国家代表参加的这个会议一定能有助于朝鲜问题的和平解决（这是朝鲜人民和全世界所有爱好和平的人民希望了很久的事）——如果日内瓦会议与会者尊重亚洲人民、特别是朝鲜人民的合法利益的话。
