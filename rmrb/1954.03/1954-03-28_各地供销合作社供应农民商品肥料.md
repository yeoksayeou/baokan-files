Supply and marketing cooperatives across the country are actively carrying out the storage and supply of commodity fertilizers. According to incomplete statistics, the quantity of oilseed cake fertilizer prepared by various regions has exceeded that of the same period last year by 40%, and the quantity of chemical fertilizer has exceeded that of the same period last year by 14%.

This year, farmers in various regions need a large quantity of fertilizer. According to a survey by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the national demand for fertilizer last year was more than 5 million tons, and this year it is about 7 million tons. In addition to vigorously opening up sources of supply and actively storing fertilizers such as oilseed cake, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are also actively cooperating with local Party committees and governments to mobilize farmers to accumulate natural fertilizers. For example, the Xinji Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, organized farmers to dig pond mud, which can fertilize 8,000 mu of land. Xinhui, Zhongshan, Luoding, Nanhai and other counties in Guangdong Province have organized farmers to accumulate various miscellaneous fertilizers such as fish fertilizer, shrimp bran, and chicken feathers.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have successively launched fertilizer supply work. Cooperatives in many regions have signed contracts with organized farmers to supply fertilizers in a planned way. The cooperatives in Xinzhou, Yongji, Jiangxian, and Wenxi counties in Shanxi Province signed contracts with 560 agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams to supply more than 2.04 million jin of various fertilizers. The Xishui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hubei Province promoted the "deposit-in-kind pre-sale contract" in rural areas. Many mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives voluntarily deposited cotton, oil and other materials into the cooperative to order fertilizers and other means of production. In Jinqiao Village, Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, in the case of insufficient fertilizer, households lacking fertilizer were organized into groups to negotiate and distribute fertilizer according to the planting ratio of major crops, so that fertilizer could be used on crops particularly needed by the state.

### 各地供销合作社供应农民商品肥料

    各地供销合作社供应农民商品肥料
    全国各地供销合作社积极进行商品肥料的储备和供应工作。据不完全统计，各地目前已备妥油饼肥料的数量超过去年同期百分之四十，化学肥料数量超过去年同期百分之十四。
    今年各地农民需要肥料的数量很大，据全国合作总社调查了解，去年全国农民需要肥料五百多万吨，今年约为七百万吨上下。各地供销合作社除大力开辟货源，积极储备油饼等肥料外，并积极配合各地党委、政府动员农民积累自然肥料。如安徽省颍上县新集供销合作社在当地党委、政府领导下，组织农民挖塘泥，可肥地八千亩。广东省新会、中山、罗定、南海等县都组织农民积累了鱼肥、虾糠、鸡毛等各种杂肥。
    从去年第四季度开始，各地供销合作社即陆续展开肥料供应工作。许多地区的合作社和组织起来的农民签订合同，有计划地供应肥料。山西省新绛、永济、绛县、闻喜等四县的合作社即和五百六十个农业生产合作社及互助组签订合同，供应各种肥料二百零四万余斤。湖北省浠水县供销合作社在农村推广“存实预售合同”，许多互助组、农业生产合作社自愿地把棉花、油料等存到合作社里，订购肥料等生产资料。江苏省吴县津桥村在肥料不足的情况下，组织缺肥料户按小组根据主要作物种植比重协商分配，使肥料用在国家特别需要的作物上。
