Educating Female Workers to Actively Participate in Socialist Industrial Construction
Deputy Director of the Research Office of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Huang Gan Ying

    Realizing the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, and building a bright and splendid socialist motherland, is the highest interest and the common goal of struggle for the people of the whole country, and this has a more profound significance for the vast number of female workers, female staff members, family members of workers and staff, and working women. Because, only by realizing a socialist society can the political and economic status of women be further improved, can complete equality between men and women be achieved, and can women achieve complete liberation. With the development of socialist industrialization, the number of women participating in social production is increasing day by day, and the socialist economic system has created the most necessary conditions for women to achieve complete liberation.

    To realize socialist industrialization, we must rely closely on the high socialist consciousness and selfless labor of both male and female workers. In the past four years, in the great cause of building the motherland, women have increasingly become an important force in socialist industrial construction. Female workers, together with male workers, have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, actively participated in labor competitions, and contributed greatly to increasing production and fulfilling national production plans. For example, in September 1953, 135 out of 150 female worker groups in the fine spinning workshops of eight state-owned cotton textile factories in Qingdao comprehensively completed the state plan. In production, female workers, with the attitude of masters of the country, sought out tricks, tapped potential, and created many new production records. For example, Han Guihua, a female worker at the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, created the national record of watching 1,400 spindles, and Zhang Sihua, a female worker at the fine spinning workshop of the Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory, proposed a suggestion for machine modification, which can save the country 360 million yuan annually. In the labor competition of industrial production, a large number of female labor models and female advanced workers have emerged in various places, and many of them have been trained as leading cadres. According to incomplete statistics from Qingdao and Jinan alone, since 1951, 153 female workers have been trained as factory administrative cadres, and 158 have been trained as trade union cadres.

    At present, the vast number of female workers are, together with male workers, actively and conscientiously studying the general line of the country during the transition period. Through study, their enthusiasm for production has been further encouraged. They feel keenly that socialist society is not only a beautiful ideal, but a concrete and attainable reality in the long-term perspective. Therefore, they are more energetic in production, and have expressed their willingness to accelerate the construction of socialist industrialization and accelerate the arrival of socialism with practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, after studying the general line, the female workers of the Dongya Enterprise Company Woolen Mill studied how to improve labor efficiency and reduce waste wool, and reallocated the locomotives, with highly skilled workers using old locomotives and leading less skilled workers. As a result, production greatly increased, and the waste wool rate significantly decreased, from an average of 270 jin of wool spun per person per day in the past to an average of 300 jin of wool spun per person per day, and from an average of four pounds of waste wool produced per hundred jin of raw wool in the past to one pound of waste wool produced. After studying the general line, the ideological awareness of many female workers has also been further improved, and some ideological problems have also been resolved, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production. Huang Jinlan, a female worker at the Fuzhou Flax Spinning Factory, was dissatisfied with the adjustment of wages in the past and was not active in production. Others produced 22 jin per day, but she planned to produce 16 jin per day, and actually produced a maximum of 13 jin. After studying the general line, she conducted a self-criticism and greatly increased her output in production. Now her daily output is 30 jin, and the scrap rate has also dropped from 21% to 12.5%. However, among the masses of female workers, due to the limitations of past historical and social conditions, the burden of housework and children, and the opportunities to participate in social activities and study are generally less than those of male workers. Therefore, in addition to the non-proletarian ideological consciousness that they share with male workers, generally speaking, female workers have a greater sense of inferiority, a shorter vision, and a poorer sense of career. But because they have suffered the most in the past, and long for the beautiful life of socialist society and the true equality between men and women, they are pure and enthusiastic, and accept new things quickly. As long as the truth is clearly explained, they will quickly raise their awareness and actively participate in socialist industrial construction. Therefore, in carrying out the propaganda and education of the general line among female workers, in addition to generally explaining the beautiful prospects of socialism, focusing on pointing out the responsibilities of female workers in the great cause of building socialism, clarifying the direction of efforts, and explaining the difficulties in construction, so as to promote them to more consciously participate in labor production, it is also necessary to conduct more popular and detailed propaganda and education in light of the characteristics and specific ideological conditions of female workers. The content of propaganda and education should focus on the following points:

    First, we must be good at enlightening female workers to understand the relationship between daily labor and the current construction of socialist society. It should be explained that the quality of our labor and production every day is related to the speed of the country's construction. If every female worker can actively improve her skills and learn advanced experience like Hao Jianxiu and Han Guihua, the speed of socialist construction will be accelerated. Conversely, if every worker fails to complete the state plan, the construction task may be delayed. When conducting this kind of propaganda, we can guide the enthusiasm of female workers for daily labor production into the current movement to increase production and practice economy by using the method of detailed accounting based on the situation of local factories, in order to establish advanced ideas and learn from advanced figures. For example, the Hengda Tobacco Factory, in conjunction with the propaganda of the general line, calculated an account for the female workers: in the past four years, the profits earned by the Hengda Tobacco Factory and the national taxes paid (the funds accumulated for the country) can be used to build ten new factories of the same scale as Hengda. If only the third workshop packs 100 more packs of cigarettes per person per day, the entire workshop can increase production by 11.193 billion yuan per year. If everyone in the factory wastes ten minutes a day, the loss will be 940 million yuan per month. After listening to this, many female workers greatly improved their awareness of labor production and understood that a beautiful socialist society is built from everyone's labor and the production of every machine tool.

    Second, we must be good at guiding female workers to broaden their horizons, pay attention to the future, and understand that today's arduous struggle is for a better life tomorrow, and that today's most important task is to work hard to produce, increase the quantity of products, improve the quality of products, and complete the state plan. Only when production is improved can the lives of workers be improved, and only on the basis of production development can the special problems of female workers be gradually solved. Excessive demands for increased wages and welfare, or disregarding the overall interests in order to satisfy one's own immediate economic needs, are behaviors that are detrimental to the great cause of building socialism. It is necessary to educate them to subordinate personal interests to national interests, and to subordinate immediate interests to long-term interests. In the past, in some areas, work was done solely from the perspective of meeting the welfare needs of female workers, and many welfare undertakings were carried out, but no education on the future of socialism was combined. As a result, many welfare undertakings were carried out, but the purpose of increasing production was not achieved, but instead the thoughts and behaviors of a few female workers who only cared about their personal interests were encouraged.

    Third, it must be repeatedly explained to female workers that improving skills and learning advanced experience are of great significance for improving production and completing the state production plan. Without skills, without ability, and without creativity, it is impossible to play a sufficient role in the cause of building socialism. Female workers generally have a poor technical foundation, so this issue needs to be emphasized. In the propaganda, not only should we propose to learn from China's advanced male and female workers and technicians, but also emphasize learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and learning advanced experience must first learn the advanced ideas of the advanced. It is a mistake to regard advanced experience as a simple working method or as a purely technical issue. Much advanced experience is created by advanced workers who possess the noble qualities of the working class, under the continuous education of the Party, with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, socialist ideas, a master's creative selfless labor, a spirit of tenacious overcoming difficulties, and a bold struggle against old traditions and old standards. If the leadership does not have a sufficient understanding of this point, it will not produce good results. Therefore, in the propaganda, we must change the conservative and complacent ideas existing among female workers, patiently guide them to strengthen their sense of career, keep their eyes on the future, and pay attention to the great prospects of a beautiful socialist future; encourage them to enthusiastically learn from the advanced and learn from the advanced. And the leading cadres of the factory should also be particularly enthusiastic about caring for and supporting the rationalization proposals and inventions of female workers, and patiently helping female workers improve their skills and learn advanced experience.

    When carrying out the propaganda and education of the general line among female workers, generally speaking, young female workers, because they have more opportunities to participate in study and accept advanced ideas more quickly, quickly move once they are mobilized. They often become advanced and leaders in the movement to increase production and practice economy, so it is right to strengthen education for young female workers and attach importance to their role. But the education work for married female workers, especially female workers with children, needs to be grasped even more tightly. The reason why it is important is not only because the number of married female workers and female workers with children is increasing day by day, and female workers with children often account for more than half of the number of female workers (according to statistics, every four female workers give birth to an average of one child per year), but the most important thing is that these married female workers and female workers with children are generally workers with longer seniority and more skilled skills, and should have become the backbone in production, but due to the burden of housework and children, some people also have some problems in their thinking, have more concerns, and have a heavier sense of inferiority, coupled with insufficient in-depth and specific education for them, so some of them play a far less role in production than young female workers. In carrying out the propaganda and education of the general line, it should be required to pay special attention to them, improve their ideological awareness, help them overcome difficulties, and gradually make them become the backbone in production. If we give up educating them, it will affect the completion of the national production plan. In the past, all workshops and groups in the Tianjin No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill were unwilling to have female workers with children, because they were troublesome and afraid of affecting the completion of the group's plan. The factory administration and the trade union paid attention to this problem, strengthened the work for married female workers, cared about their difficulties, assigned them to suitable workshops according to the characteristics of breastfeeding female workers, and conducted family visits to solve some problems that could be assisted in solving (such as family disputes, the economic status of female workers in the family, etc.), so that married female workers could concentrate their energy on production; the factory trade union and the female workers' committee went deeper into the workshops, cultivated typical examples, summarized the advanced experience of some advanced female workers with children, and established banners, which resulted in other female workers with children becoming active in production. For example, the attendance rate of the female worker group with breastfeeding children reached 96% from January to September last year (the average attendance rate of the whole factory was 93%), and the rate of substandard cloth was also significantly reduced. In December last year, the rate of substandard cloth in the female worker group with breastfeeding children was 2% to 1%, while the rate of substandard cloth stipulated by the state was 3%. Facts have proved that summarizing the typical advanced experience of female workers with children has a great effect on encouraging and driving the production of female workers with children, because they are easy to accept. Therefore, in the propaganda of the general line and other education work, this law should be grasped.

    The general line is a bright lighthouse, it illuminates our various tasks, and also illuminates the road for our women to achieve complete liberation. As long as we correctly guide all female workers to study hard, improve their political awareness, improve their scientific and technological level, actively participate in labor competitions, abide by labor discipline, and learn and create advanced experience, and unite with male workers, help each other, supervise each other, and learn from each other, they will definitely be able to play a greater role in the cause of building socialism.

    教育女职工积极参加社会主义工业建设
    中华全国民主妇女联合会研究室副主任　黄甘英
    实现国家过渡时期的总路线、总任务，建设光辉灿烂的社会主义祖国，是全国人民最高的利益和一致奋斗的目标，这对于广大的女工、女职员、职工家属和劳动妇女来说，有着更深刻的意义。因为，只有实现了社会主义社会，妇女的政治、经济地位才能进一步提高，才能完全实现男女平等，才能达到妇女彻底的解放。随着社会主义工业化的发展，妇女参加社会生产事业的数量日益增加，社会主义的经济制度，创造了妇女求得彻底解放的最必需的条件。
    实现社会主义工业化，必须紧紧地依靠男女职工高度的社会主义觉悟和忘我的劳动。四年来，在建设祖国的伟大事业中，妇女日益成为社会主义工业建设中的一支重要力量。女职工和男职工在一起，发挥了高度的爱国热情，积极参加劳动竞赛，为提高生产、完成国家生产计划而贡献了很大的力量。如一九五三年九月青岛八个国营棉纺织厂细纱车间一百五十个女工小组中，就有一百三十五个小组全面地完成了国家计划。女职工们在生产中，以国家主人翁的态度，找窍门，挖潜力，创造了许多新的生产纪录。如唐山华新纺织厂女工韩桂花创造了看一千四百锭的全国最高纪录，济南仁丰纱厂细纱车间女工张司华提出了改装机器的建议，每年可为国家节约三亿六千万元。在工业生产的劳动竞赛中，各地涌现出了大批的女劳动模范和女先进工作者，她们中有不少人已被培养为领导骨干。仅据青岛、济南二市不完全的统计，一九五一年以来，女工中被培养为工厂行政干部的有一百五十三人，被培养为工会干部的有一百五十八人。
    目前，广大的女职工群众正和男职工一起积极认真地学习国家过渡时期的总路线。通过学习，更加鼓舞了她们的生产热情。她们亲切地感到社会主义社会已不仅是美好的理想，而是具体可及的现实的远景，她们因而在生产上更加起劲，纷纷表示要以增产节约的实际行动来加速社会主义工业化的建设，加速社会主义的到来。如东亚企业公司毛织厂的女工们，学习总路线之后，研究了如何提高劳动效率及减少废毛的问题，重新调配了机车，由技术高的工人使用旧的机车并带动技术差的工人，因而生产量大大提高，废毛率显著下降，从过去每人每天平均纺二百七十斤毛，增至平均每人每日纺三百斤毛，从过去每百斤原毛平均出四磅废毛，降低到出一磅废毛。经过总路线的学习，许多的女职工的思想觉悟也进一步提高了，某些思想问题也得到解决，生产上出现了一片新的气象。福州麻纺厂女工黄金兰，过去对调整工资不满，生产不积极，别人每天生产二十二斤，她订计划一天生产十六斤，实际最多生产十三斤。学习总路线后，她自己进行了检讨，生产中大大地提高了产量，现在日产量是三十斤，废品率也由百分之二十一降至百分之十二点五。但是，在女职工群众中，由于过去历史条件和社会条件的限制，家务、孩子的牵累，参加社会活动和参加学习的机会一般比男职工少一些，因此，她们除了和男职工共同存在一些非无产阶级的思想意识外，一般说来女职工的自卑感更甚一些，眼光比较短小一些，事业心比较差一些。但又由于她们过去受的痛苦最深，渴望着社会主义社会的美好生活，和男女的真正平等，她们纯朴而热情，接受新事物快，只要真正把道理讲清楚，她们就会很快地提高觉悟，积极参加社会主义工业建设。因此，向女职工进行总路线的宣传教育，除要一般地讲清社会主义的美好远景，着重指出女职工在建设社会主义伟大事业中的责任，明确努力方向，并说明建设中的困难，促使她们更加自觉地参加劳动生产之外，还要针对女职工的特点和具体的思想情况，更加通俗地、细致地进行宣传教育。宣传教育内容应着重以下几点：
    第一，要善于启发女职工了解日常劳动与当前建设社会主义社会的关系。说明我们每人每天的劳动生产的好坏，都关系着祖国建设的快慢。如果每个女工都能够像郝建秀、韩桂花那样积极地提高技术，学习先进经验，社会主义的建设速度就会加快。反之，如果每个工人都完不成国家计划，建设任务就可能推迟。进行这种宣传时，可以根据当地工厂的情况，用算细账的办法，把女职工的日常劳动生产的热情引向当前的增产节约运动中去，以树立先进思想，向先进人物看齐。如恒大烟草厂结合总路线的宣传给女工们算了一笔账：四年来，恒大烟草厂获得的利润和上缴国税（为国家积累的资金）可再建设十个与恒大同样规模的新厂，仅第三车间如果每人每天多包一百包烟，全车间一年即可增产一百十一亿九千三百万元。如果全厂每人每天浪费十分钟，一个月就损失九亿四千余万元。许多女工听了之后，大大地提高了劳动生产的自觉性，懂得了美好的社会主义就是从每个人的劳动和每一台机床的生产中建立起来的。
      第二，要善于引导女职工打开眼界，注视将来，懂得今天的艰苦奋斗是为了明天的美好生活，而今天最主要的任务就是努力生产，增加产品数量，提高产品质量，完成国家计划。只有生产提高了，工人的生活才能提高，也只有在生产发展的基础上，女职工的特殊问题才能逐步得到解决。过高的要求提高工资和福利，或为了满足自己一点眼前的经济上的要求，而不顾整体的利益，是对建设社会主义的伟大事业不利的行为。要教育她们个人的利益服从国家的利益，眼前的利益要服从长远的利益。过去在工作中，有的地区曾单纯从满足女职工的福利要求出发，举办了很多福利事业，而并未结合进行社会主义前途教育，结果福利事业是办了不少，但未达到提高生产的目的，反而助长了少数女工只顾个人利益的思想和行为。
    第三，必须向女职工反复说明，提高技术，学习先进经验，对提高生产和完成国家生产计划具有十分重大的意义。没有技术，没有能力，没有创造性，就不能在建设社会主义的事业中起足够的作用。女职工一般技术基础较差，所以这个问题就更有着重提出的必要。在宣传中，不仅应该提出向中国的先进男女工人、技术人员学习，还要强调学习苏联的先进经验，而学习先进经验又必须首先学习先进者的先进思想。如果把先进经验看作是简单的工作方法，或看作是单纯的技术问题，是十分错误的。多少的先进经验，都是先进工作者们具备了高贵的工人阶级的品质，在党的不断的教育下，以高度的爱国主义国际主义的思想，社会主义思想，主人翁的创造性的忘我劳动，顽强地克服困难的精神和大胆地向旧的传统、旧的标准进行不屈的斗争中创造出来的。如果领导上对这一点认识不足，就不会产生良好的结果。为此，在宣传中，要改变女职工中存在的保守和满足现状的想法，耐心地引导她们加强事业心，眼睛注视着将来，注视美好的社会主义的远大前途；鼓舞她们热情地向先进者学习，向先进者看齐。而工厂的领导干部也应特别热情地关心和支持女职工的合理化建议与发明创造，耐心地帮助女职工提高技术、学习先进经验。
    在向女职工进行总路线的宣传教育时，一般说来，青年女工因为参加学习的机会多，接受先进思想较快，一经发动，很快就动起来，她们常常成为增产节约运动中的先进者和带头人，因此对青年女工加强教育，重视她们的作用是对的。但对已婚的女工特别是有孩子的女工的教育工作更需要抓紧。其所以重要，这不仅是因为已婚的和有孩子的女工的数量日益增加，有孩子的女工常常占女工数量的一半以上（据统计每四个女工每年平均要生一个孩子），而最主要的是，这些已婚的和有孩子的女工，她们一般的是工龄较长，技术较熟练的工人，本来应当成为生产中的骨干，但由于家务、孩子的牵累，有的人在思想上也存在一些问题，顾虑较多，自卑感也较重，加之对她们的深入具体的教育不够，因此她们之中有些人在生产上发挥的作用远不如青年女工。在进行总路线的宣传教育中，应该要求对她们特别加以重视，提高她们的思想觉悟，帮助她们克服困难，使她们逐渐成为生产中的骨干。如果放弃对她们的教育，就将会影响国家生产计划的完成。过去，天津国棉三厂各车间各小组都不愿意要有孩子的女工，嫌麻烦，怕影响小组计划的完成。工厂行政和工会注意了这一问题，加强了对已婚女工的工作，体贴她们的困难，根据哺乳女工的特点来分配她们到适宜的车间，并进行了家庭访问，解决了一些可以协助解决的问题（如家庭纠纷、女工在家庭中的经济地位等），使已婚的女工能集中精力于生产；厂工会及女工委员更深入车间，培养典型，总结某些先进的有孩子的女工的先进经验，树立旗帜，结果带动了其他有孩子的女工在生产上积极起来。如有哺乳孩子的妈妈女工组去年一月至九月的出勤率达百分之九十六（全厂平均出勤率是百分之九十三），次布率也显著地减少了。去年十二月份妈妈女工组的次布率是百分之二至百分之一，而国家规定的次布率是百分之三。事实证明，总结有孩子女工的典型先进经验，对鼓舞和带动有孩子女工的生产有极大的作用，因为她们容易接受。因此，在宣传总路线和进行其他的教育工作中，都应当抓住这个规律。
    总路线是光明的灯塔，它照耀着我们各项工作，也照亮了我们妇女达到彻底解放的道路，只要我们正确地引导全体女职工努力学习，提高政治觉悟，提高科学技术水平，积极参加劳动竞赛，遵守劳动纪律，学习和创造先进经验。并与男职工团结在一起，互相帮助，互相督促，互相学习，在建设社会主义事业中一定能发挥更大的作用。
