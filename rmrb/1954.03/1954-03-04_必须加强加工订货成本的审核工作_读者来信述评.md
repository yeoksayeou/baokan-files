    The Audit Work of Processing and Ordering Costs Must Be Strengthened
    ——Comments on Readers' Letters
  　Jiang Jun
    Processing and ordering is one of the forms and steps of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry by the state. Verifying the cost of processing and ordering, and reasonably adjusting the wage-labor profit, plays a significant role in doing a good job in processing and ordering. In the past, most of the wage-labor and goods prices set for processing and ordering were appropriate; however, there were also cases of being too high or too low in some industries. According to readers' letters to this newspaper, there are still many cases of overestimating costs and excessive profits in processing and ordering. The preliminary inspection by the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce of private industry proved that in the seventeen processing and ordering tasks accepted by the machinery manufacturing and metal products manufacturing industries alone, most of them had varying degrees of cost overestimation. After auditing one hundred and twenty-eight processing and ordering contracts signed by the Beijing Trust Company, it was found that many private factories accepting processing and ordering had falsely reported working hours, wages, materials, and operating expenses. The Beijing Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Company signed processing contracts with twenty-seven private iron factories in August, September, and October of last year, totaling more than 2,200 tons; after the contracts were signed, the costs were re-audited in the factories, and many factories reduced the original costs, with the smallest reduction being 9.84% of the original total cost, and the largest being 23%. In Guangzhou's new pharmaceutical industry, the net profit margin per unit of finished product is generally above 50%, and some are as high as 725%. In Tianjin's pharmaceutical industry, the annual profit of injections is generally around 300%, and tablets are as high as 200%; after adjustments by professional meetings, it is still above 150%. The average processing and ordering profit of the cotton textile and machinery industries in Yingkou City, Liaodong Province, is 100.4%. The annual profit rate of the Beijing private Qunli Yuji Foundry is over 900%. The above situation shows that the situation of overestimating costs and unreasonable profits by some private factories when processing and ordering for the state is quite serious.
    The reasons for this situation are, on the one hand, due to the varying degrees of backwardness in the production, operation, and management of my country's capitalist industry. Many private factories lack workshop records and cost accounting, or if they have them, they are not complete, which affects the correct accounting of product costs. But the more important reason is that some capitalists intentionally falsely report expenses in order to obtain illegal profits, and calculate higher costs based on abnormal output in the past or the output quota during trial production or initial production; or they believe that the products sell well and the market demand exceeds the supply, taking the opportunity to raise costs and expenses. For example, the Chunxing Iron Factory in Dalian City processed 5,703 sets of weft spindles, which actually required 566 labor hours, but falsely reported 1,354 labor hours, making a profit of more than 70%. The Tongkang Iron Factory in Xi'an City undertook 3,500 milling cutters for a certain unit, with a cost of 76,000 yuan each, but overestimated it to 170,000 yuan. The cost of each dozen of No. 210 gold pens from the Guangzhou Huanan Gold Pen Factory was 398,560 yuan, but falsely reported 485,100 yuan. It should be pointed out that the behavior of capitalists intentionally falsely reporting costs in an attempt to obtain illegal profits is not an isolated case at present, and the local administrations for industry and commerce and processing and ordering departments should pay attention to it.
    To prevent capitalists from falsely reporting costs and correctly determining wage-labor and goods prices, cadres in the processing and ordering departments should be educated to attach importance to and earnestly do a good job in auditing the cost of processing and ordering. On the one hand, they should be made to realize that this work is one of the methods for the state to utilize, restrict, and transform capitalist industry. If it is not done well, it will not only increase the expenditure of wage-labor fees and increase the burden on the state and the people; but it will also encourage some capitalists to take chances and engage in speculation, which is not conducive to the improvement of the operation and management of private industry. On the other hand, they should also be helped to become as familiar as possible with production technology and understand the actual working hours and materials required for the product, so that they have the conditions to do the work well. At the same time, we must rely on the broad masses of workers to supervise the capitalists. The workers, especially the old technicians, are the most familiar with production technology and the most understanding of the production process. The capitalists' behavior of overestimating costs cannot be hidden from their eyes. This will not only prevent capitalists from overestimating costs, but also guarantee the specifications, quality, and completion date of the processed and ordered products.
    In addition, doing a good job in auditing the cost of processing and ordering also requires gradually unifying cost items. This is a rather complex and meticulous task, which requires the local administrations for industry and commerce to uniformly lead the processing and ordering departments to gradually and systematically carry out the work according to the specific conditions of various industries in the area and the state policies. This work is currently not possible in all industries and all processing and ordering, but in the regular and large-volume processing and ordering of important industries, costs can and should be verified, and cost items should be unified; cost items can also be gradually unified in the main processing and ordering in a large number of small industries. The audit of costs and the unification of cost items should be based on the principle of a medium and reasonable standard, playing a role in encouraging the advanced and promoting the backward. In principle, unreasonable material quotas, excessive waste, and unreasonable expenses that are not necessary for production should not be included in the cost. A more reasonable profit standard should be stipulated based on the supply and demand of various goods, the interests of the manufacturers, sellers, and consumers, and taking into account the stability of market prices. Generally speaking, this standard should be calculated according to different situations, so that enterprises can obtain a profit of about 10% to 30% per year based on their capital under normal and reasonable management. This profit should be calculated according to the medium standard of normal and reasonable management. If some private enterprises improve their operation, reduce costs, and improve quality, and some profits exceed this regulation under the circumstances of meeting social needs, complying with state regulations, and taking into account the purchasing power of consumers, it is also permissible. If this work is done well, it will promote private factories to improve their operation and management, reduce costs, and the sales of products will gradually broaden, and production can also be appropriately developed.
    The general line is like a lighthouse, illuminating the road for all the people of our country to move forward. The local administrations for industry and commerce and processing and ordering departments should take the audit of processing and ordering costs as a specific task to implement the general line, and earnestly do it well; the broad masses of workers in private factories should also give play to the leading role of the working class and supervise the capitalists; the private industries that process and order for the state should also accept socialist transformation, actively improve operation and management, and eliminate illegal acts of falsely reporting costs.

    必须加强加工订货成本的审核工作
    ——读者来信述评
  　姜军
    加工订货是国家对资本主义工业进行社会主义改造的形式和步骤之一。核实加工订货成本，合理调整工缴利润，对做好加工订货工作有着重大作用。过去加工订货所定的工缴和货价大多数是恰当的；但是在部分行业中也有偏高偏低的现象。根据本报读者来信反映，目前加工订货中，成本估计过高、利润过大的现象仍然不少。北京市工商管理局对私营工业初步检查的结果证明：仅机器制造和金属品制造两行业在接受国家十七宗加工订货任务中，大部分有不同程度的高估成本行为。北京市信托公司签订的一百二十八份加工订货合同，经过审核，发现不少接受加工订货的私营厂有虚报工时、工资、用料和经营费用的行为。中国五金机械公司北京市公司在去年曾与二十七家私营铁工厂签订八、九、十月份加工合同，共计二千二百余吨；合同签订后，经过下厂重核成本，不少厂降低了原成本，少的降低了原成本总数的百分之九点八四，多的降低了百分之二十三。广州市新药业，单位成品纯利率一般在百分之五十以上，有的甚至高达百分之七百二十五。天津市制药业针剂年利一般均在百分之三百左右，片剂也高达百分之二百；经过专业会议调整后仍在百分之一百五十以上。辽东省营口市棉织和机械工业的加工订货利润，平均是百分之一百点四。北京私营群力玉记铸造厂年利率达百分之九百以上。以上情况，说明部分私营工厂在为国家加工订货时成本估计过高、利润不合理的情况是相当严重的。
    造成这种情况的原因，一方面固然由于我国资本主义工业在生产、经营和管理上都带有不同程度的落后性，很多私营工厂缺乏车间纪录和成本会计，纵或有也不健全，影响到产品成本的正确核算。但更重要的原因还是有些资本家为了获得非法利润，有意虚报开支用额，根据以往不正常的产量或试制、初制时的产量定额算出较高的成本；或者认为产品销路好，市场上供不应求，乘机高抬成本费用。如旅大市春兴铁工厂加工纬纺锭子五千七百零三套，实际需工五六六个，却虚报为一三五四个工，获利在百分之七十以上。西安市同康铁工厂承接某单位三千五百个铣刀，每个成本七万六千元，竟高估为十七万元。广州华南金笔厂二一零号金笔每打成本为三十九万八千五百六十元，却虚报为四十八万五千一百元。应该指出，资本家有意虚报成本、企图获取非法利润的行为，在目前并不是个别的，各地工商行政部门和加工订货部门应该引起注意。
    要防止资本家虚报成本的行为，正确地核定工缴货价，应该教育加工订货部门的干部切实重视并认真做好加工订货成本的审核工作。一方面，应该使他们认识，这项工作，是国家对资本主义工业进行利用、限制和改造的方法之一。如果做得不好，不但会增加工缴费的支出，加重国家和人民的负担；而且会助长某些资本家投机取巧的行为，不利于私营工业经营管理的改进。另一方面，还应该帮助他们尽可能地熟悉生产技术，了解产品实际所需的工时和用料，以便有条件把工作做好。同时，必须依靠广大职工对资本家进行监督。职工们，尤其是老技工们，是最熟悉生产技术和最了解生产过程的，资本家高估成本的行为不可能瞒过他们的眼睛。这样作，不仅能够防止资本家高估成本的行为，而且对加工订货产品的规格、质量和完工日期等都能起到保证作用。
    此外，做好加工订货成本的审核工作，还需要逐步地统一成本项目。这是一项相当复杂而细致的工作，需要各地工商行政部门统一领导加工订货部门根据当地各行业的具体情况和国家政策，逐步地、有计划地进行。这项工作目前还不可能在一切行业和一切加工订货中做到，但在重要行业的经常而大宗的加工订货中，可以而且应该核实成本，统一成本项目；大量小行业中的主要加工订货也可以逐步统一成本项目。审核成本和统一成本项目，应该以中等合理标准为原则，起到鼓励先进、推动落后的作用。凡是原材料定额不合理，浪费太多和不是生产必需的不合理开支，原则上都不应计入成本。应该根据各种货品的供求情况，根据制造者、贩卖者与消费者三方面的利益，并照顾到市场物价的稳定，规定一个比较合理的利润标准。一般地说，这个标准应按照不同情况，使企业按其资本计算，在正常合理经营的情况下，每年获得百分之十到百分之三十左右的利润。这个利润应按正常合理经营的中等标准计算。某些私营企业，如果因为改善经营、降低成本、提高质量，在适应社会需要、遵守国家规定、又照顾到了消费者的购买能力的情况下，有些利润超过这个规定也是可以的。这项工作做好了，就能促使私营工厂改善经营管理，降低成本，产品销路也会逐渐广阔，生产也能得到适当的发展。
    总路线像灯塔一样，照耀着我国全体人民前进的道路。各地工商行政部门和加工订货部门应把审核加工订货成本作为贯彻总路线的一项具体工作，认真把它做好；私营工厂的广大职工也应该发挥工人阶级的领导作用，对资本家进行监督；为国家加工订货的私营工业也应该接受社会主义改造，积极改进经营管理，肃清虚报成本的不法行为。
