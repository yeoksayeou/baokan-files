Building a Factory Must Have a Thorough Overall Plan and Reasonable Construction Procedures
Harbin Electric Motor Factory Chief Engineer Zhao Shuoxin

The completion of a heavy machinery manufacturing factory, from design to civil engineering installation and the start of full-scale production, takes at least three to five years. During this considerable period, the work involves a multitude of tasks, all interconnected and mutually constraining. Some can be done in parallel, while others must follow a specific sequence, one thing waiting for another. If we do not understand and grasp these principles, and do not design and construct according to a certain order, we will inevitably cause various kinds of waste: delayed progress, reduced quality, increased investment, and "rework." From the large and small events we have experienced since the factory's construction and the waste of tens and hundreds of millions of yuan of state investment, we have deeply realized that a thorough overall plan and reasonable construction procedures are absolutely indispensable in factory construction work.

Starting from the Remote Office
The first permanent building completed near our factory area was a two-story building intended for use as a central research laboratory in the future, and temporarily as an office. The plan for temporary use was not too bad in itself, but the problem was that this building was erected before the final determination of the master plan. Since the completion of this building, the factory's product plan has changed several times, and the master layout plan has been revised more than a dozen times. Sadly, this building intended for long-term use has been moved far away from the factory area. As the current nerve center of the entire factory, the office building is separated from the current factory area by a piece of open space. Going to the production workshop and back requires walking about one kilometer, and going to and from the farthest oxygen workshop takes three to four minutes. Leaving aside the current inconvenience, what will happen to this building when the formal office and research laboratory are established in the future? Of course, the building will not be useless, but such an unreasonable "plan" is indeed intolerable.

In order to speed things up, we also built a production workshop, two warehouses, a boiler room, and part of the railway and pipeline system before the master layout was determined. However, except for one production workshop that received appropriate "care" and only needed slight modifications, the other projects almost all need to be rebuilt. Rebuilding means demolishing the old and building the new. To date, we have rebuilt the railway and pipeline system. Soon, the obstructive warehouses will also be demolished, and the initial boiler room can only be kept as a backup. In short, a considerable portion of the basic construction projects that should have been planned for the long term only "completed" their historical mission in the process of one or two years because they were built too early and did not conform to the later-decided overall design. This is the result of designing and constructing simultaneously.

The Isolated Production Workshop
In order to save time and prioritize production, our enthusiastic factory designers concentrated their efforts and completed the technical design of a production workshop very early. Our construction unit also concentrated its efforts to build this workshop in order to start production. The workshop was indeed built and put into production in about a year. However, production is an integrated whole of many active units. A workshop is not an all-encompassing, omnipotent unit and must rely on the cooperation of other workshops. The workshop needs tools, but our tool supply depends on a temporary workshop several kilometers away. If a pin or screw breaks temporarily on a tool, or if a die becomes blunt and needs to be sharpened, sometimes it cannot be resolved without transporting it back and forth for a dozen kilometers. The machine equipment in the workshop is bound to be damaged and need repair. It is also necessary to repair and assemble some parts during the installation of the machines, but our repair workshop has not yet been established, so we have to squeeze the repair work into the production workshop. As a result, the repair team complained of being dependent on others, lacking equipment and space; the production workshop complained that the repair work disrupted its work schedule; and the installation department complained that the production department did not support basic construction and did not solve the problem of parts processing. The result was serious equipment damage, slow repair progress, and passive installation work. The production workshop needs a large number of castings, but our foundry workshop was established far later than the machining workshop. For a long period, the castings relied on a temporary workshop located elsewhere; when supplies were insufficient, they had to be outsourced to private merchants. Occasionally, if defective products occurred and needed to be remade, the production section's dispatchers and handlers had to run back and forth between the two locations in a panic. Other processes, such as annealing weldments, pouring alloy for bearings, and electroplating parts, could not be solved by the production workshop itself. This production workshop is like a bare body, without hands or feet. For more than a year, although it has produced some products, it has brought many unnecessary losses and waste to production because it is isolated and lacks the cooperation of auxiliary workshops and other workshops.

Uneven Roads, Dim Lights, Unreliable Telephones
The factory has a popular "three no's" rhyme, which undoubtedly reflects the masses' dissatisfaction with the factory. Indeed, in our factory construction procedure, the internal roads were built in the later stages. In recent years, the factory has been growing rapidly. During the most intensive construction season, tens of thousands of workers and countless vehicles traveled within the factory area, but there was not a single smooth and wide road in the factory area. When it rained, the muddy roads were simply impassable. Repairing a section of cinder road temporarily would be useless after a few trips by large trucks. Therefore, people naturally complained about "uneven roads." "Dim lights" illustrates an even bigger problem. The establishment of the entire factory's power system was also lagging behind. Not only was it often necessary to solve problems by pulling temporary lines inside the workshops, but almost every workshop's power system had to go through a "temporary" process, some for two or three months, and some for a year and a half. This investment of several billion yuan in temporary lines is the price we paid for not following the proper procedures in our design and construction. Unreliable telephones are the same story. According to the design, the entire factory's communication system includes dispatch telephones, factory director telephones, ordinary automatic telephones, and a broadcasting network, etc. However, these systems have not yet been established, but work cannot be done without telephones for a single day, so we had to solve it temporarily. Of course, it is difficult to solve the problem for departments with complex businesses, such as the production section and the material section, with only one or two telephones that are paged through a switchboard.

In fact, the "three no's" rhyme only reflects a small part of the problem. The establishment of other public utilities and welfare facilities in the factory is almost always behind the needs. Most of the factory buildings have been built, but only one-third of the designed capacity of the boilers has been installed. The steam supply cannot meet the needs, the workshop heaters cannot be opened regularly, and many new workshops are frozen. Only less than half of the designed capacity of the compressed air compressors has been installed, and the air pressure cannot be maintained. The backup water source is still being designed. When there are problems with the city water source, it cannot guarantee a 24-hour water supply. However, a 24-hour uninterrupted supply of water, electricity, steam, and air is the basic condition for a manufacturing factory to maintain production. The situation of welfare facilities not being coordinated is equally serious. The increase in dormitories has always been disproportionate to the increase in the number of employees, and there are many people who have registered for several months but have not been able to get a house. The formal canteen is only planned to be built this year, and workers have been squeezed into eating in the warehouse for almost two years. Other facilities such as medical clinics, nurseries, cooperatives, and bathrooms have either not been established at all, or although they have been established, they are far from meeting the needs. Because these material conditions are not available, the factory often feels difficulty with the living and welfare problems of employees. Of course, this is not to say that "welfare comes first," but welfare facilities that are adapted to the development of factory construction are necessary and must be considered in a timely manner.

The Design is Permanent, the Factory Needs to Do Temporary Work Itself
It must be admitted that production is constantly advancing and therefore constantly changing. Especially in factories like ours that mainly produce single products, it is impossible for the actual products produced to remain unchanged according to the product plan designed for the factory. When actual production exceeds the scope of the product plan stipulated by the new factory design, it is inevitable to add some corresponding equipment and take certain technical measures. For example, we have done this when manufacturing larger 6,000 kW hydro-generators in the medium-sized electric motor workshop. This is easy to understand and relatively reasonable. But I want to talk about another situation: simply because a certain part of the design has not been completed, but production urgently needs it, so we have to take temporary measures. For example, according to the design, the factory should have gas supply, so annealing furnaces for weldments, holding furnaces for forging, annealing furnaces for cast steel parts, core baking furnaces, heating furnaces, etc., no less than dozens of pieces of equipment throughout the factory are designed to use gas, and many gas pipelines have already been installed, but the gas station has just begun to be designed. Obviously, our foundry, forging, welding, and other workshops cannot wait until there is gas before starting work. Therefore, the design department informed us that the design is permanent and the factory needs to do temporary work for production needs, and we had to do so when necessary. Steel melting furnaces have already been producing, but the ventilation design drawings have not yet come out, so we installed temporary ventilation. The equipment for the constant temperature room in the tool workshop does not yet have detailed specifications, but precision machines have already been moved in and are about to be started. The room is so cold that you can't stretch out your hands, so we had to temporarily install heating radiators. The coal transportation equipment for the boiler room could not catch up, so we installed temporary cranes. The products came out, but there was no finished product warehouse, so we had to pile the motors east and west to barely cope. Accustomed to dealing with things temporarily, the design has lost its seriousness. In some places, we simply threw the design department aside and did it ourselves. This approach is wrong and we should try to prevent it as much as possible in the future. But whether the design department agrees with our temporary measures or our self-determined temporary measures, in any case, it always requires an investment; when the formal design comes out, we have to demolish the old and build the new; some also have to temporarily stop work, affecting production. We have not calculated this loss in detail. If we were to calculate it, it would undoubtedly be shocking.

Overall Plan and Reasonable Construction Procedures
The above are just some typical examples, but these examples are enough for us to realize why factory construction must have a thorough overall plan and reasonable construction procedures. The so-called overall factory construction plan, according to our understanding, is the overall outline and procedure of the design and construction of the factory construction project. The design department and the construction unit should, based on the amount of engineering work stipulated in the preliminary design and the factory construction deadline required by the state, make appropriate arrangements for the design and construction of the entire factory's unit projects and the production preparation work for the start of workshops. The formulation of this plan should take into account the most economical and rational use of state investment, the relatively reasonable distribution of annual engineering volume, the coordination between public utilities and production units, the coordination between auxiliary workshops and main workshops, the order of opening dates of each workshop, the preparation of production technology, and the training of personnel, etc. According to the principles we have experienced, public utilities such as the entire factory's water supply, steam supply, power, and communication systems should be built first; roads, railways, and some warehouses should also be established before the workshops, because these projects are not only necessary from the beginning of production, but are also needed in basic construction projects. The order of establishing workshops should be: first the tool workshop and repair workshop, because tool production must be ahead of product production by a stage. The early establishment of the repair workshop can greatly facilitate the machine installation of other workshops; second, the preparation workshops, such as the foundry, forging, and sheet metal workshops, so that the machining workshop has sufficient supply; finally, the machining workshop, assembly workshop, and testing workshop. Only with the full support and timely cooperation of auxiliary workshops and preparation workshops can the production workshop truly exert its capabilities. At the same time as establishing the factory area project, we should consider the increase in personnel in each period, thereby stipulating a phased construction plan for dormitories, canteens, offices, and other welfare facilities. Only under the guidance of the overall plan is it possible to avoid rework and unreasonable phenomena such as engaging in temporary projects and reluctantly coping. Needless to say, the method of designing and constructing simultaneously should not be adopted.

Not only should unit projects have a certain sequence, but within a unit project, design and construction must also be carried out according to a certain procedure. For example, in a workshop, the workshop substation, power pipeline, heating system, etc., must be installed first, just as the entire factory's public utilities should be established as early as possible. The crane equipment in the heavy workshop must be started before other installation projects begin; otherwise, the heavy machinery cannot be installed. Before the start of partial production, the foundation and floor must be laid. Before laying the floor, underground buried projects such as power branch lines, power pipelines for single equipment, and safety grounding networks must not be omitted; otherwise, the phenomenon of hitting the floor and then chiseling it will be difficult to avoid. These seem to be obvious principles, but we have learned these lessons from painful events. In the process of building our factory, we have consulted Soviet experts in various aspects on technical issues in design and construction, but we have neglected to obtain the guidance of Soviet experts on the important issue of the overall factory construction plan and construction procedures. From the suggestions and materials recently provided by some Soviet experts, it shows that our teacher, the Soviet Union, has also accumulated a complete set of experiences in this area. If we can collect the materials in this area in a timely manner and strive for expert guidance, I believe we will definitely take many fewer detours. Factory construction is a process of exploration for us. We have paid a huge price for obtaining our meager experiences and lessons. I hope that design units and construction units across the country will pay attention to the overall factory construction plan and construction procedures, and do not repeat our mistakes.

    建厂一定要有周密的总体计划和合理的建设程序
    哈尔滨电机厂主任工程师　赵硕欣
    一个重型机器制造工厂的建成，从设计到土建安装，开始全面生产，至少得经历三年至五年的过程。在这相当长的时间内，工作是千头万绪而且都是互相关联着牵制着的，其中有些可以平行作业，有些却是一件等着一件，有着一定的顺序。如果我们不了解不掌握其中的规律，不按照一定的顺序来设计和施工，那就不可避免地会造成各种的浪费：延缓进度，降低质量，增加投资，以及“返工”。从我们建厂以来所经历的大小事件和成十成百亿元国家投资的浪费中，我们深深地体会到周密的总体计划和合理的建设程序是建厂工作中一个绝对不能忽视的问题。
    从遥远的办公室说起
    在我们厂区附近第一座落成的永久性建筑物，是一座准备将来作为中央研究室，暂时作为办公室的二层楼。这个临时代用的打算倒还并不太坏，问题在于这座建筑是在总平面图最后确定前诞生的。从这座楼的完成日子起，工厂的产品方案变更了若干次，总平面布置图改了十几版，可怜这座百年大计的大楼，竟被改得远离了厂区。作为目前全厂神经中枢的办公楼，和现在的厂区远隔着一片空地，去一次生产车间，来回得走上一公里左右的路程，到最远的氧气车间来去一趟，路上得耽搁三四十分钟。目前的不方便且不说，到将来正式的办公室和研究室建立起来之后，这座楼怎么办？当然房子是不会没有用处的，但是这样不合理的“计划”确实叫人不能容忍。
    为了图快，在总平面布置确定之前，我们还建立起了一个生产车间、两个仓库、一座锅炉房，以及一部分的铁路和管路系统。但是现在除了一个生产车间得到适当的“照顾”，只须稍作修改之外，其他的工程几乎都需要重建。重建就是拆除旧的，建立新的。到目前为止，我们已经重建过铁路和管路系统，不久，碍事的仓库也将被拆除，初期的锅炉房仅能留作备用。总之，有相当部分应该是百年大计的基本建设工程，只因为建立得早了一些，与后来决定的总体设计不符合，仅在一年或两年的过程中就“完成”了它们的历史任务。这就是一边设计一边施工所得的结果。
      孤立的生产车间
    为了争取时间，为了生产第一，我们热情的工厂设计者，集中力量，很早地完成了一个生产车间的技术设计，我们建设单位也集中力量建设这个车间，以便开始生产。车间果然在一年左右的时间内建立起来而且开工生产了。但是，生产是许多活动单位结合起来的整体，一个车间不是包罗万象全能的单位，必须依靠其他车间的配合。车间生产需要工具，我们的工具供应却仰给于若干公里以外的一个临时车间，工具上临时折断了一个销子或螺丝，或者冲模用钝了需要磨一下，有时非得来回运输十几公里不能解决。车间内的机器设备不免要发生损坏，需要修理，在安装机器的过程中也必然要修配些零件，但是我们的修配车间还没有建立，不得已将修配工作挤在生产车间里。结果修理班抱怨寄人篱下，没有设备，没有地方；生产车间抱怨修配活打乱了它的作业进度；安装部门抱怨生产部门不支援基本建设，不给解决零件加工问题；结果是设备损坏严重，修理进度迟缓，安装工作被动。生产车间需要大量的铸件，而我们的铸工车间却远在加工车间之后才建立。铸件在很长的一段时期内依靠一个不在一处的临时车间；来不及供应时，还得包给私商；偶而发生废品需要重做，生产科的调度人员及搬运人员就得两地奔跑，慌乱得很。其他如焊件需要退火，轴承需要浇合金，零件需要电镀等等，均非生产车间本身所能解决。这个生产车间，好比一个光光的躯体，没有手，又没有脚。一年多来，虽然也生产了若干产品，但是因为它是孤立的，没有辅助车间及其他车间的配合，给生产上带来了许多不必要的损失和浪费。
    道路不平，电灯不明，电话不灵
    厂里流传着“三不”的歌谣，无疑的是群众对于工厂不满的反映。不错，在我们建厂的程序中，厂内公路是放在后阶段修建的。几年来，工厂在飞速地成长，在施工最紧张的季节里，上万的工人及无数的车马在厂区内来往，可是厂区内就没有一条平整宽阔的公路，下起雨来，泥泞的道路简直叫人寸步难行。临时修一段煤屑路吧，给大车汽车压上几趟就完事了，因此人们自然就发出了“道路不平”的牢骚。“电灯不明”则说明了一个更大的问题。全厂电力系统的建立，也是落在后面的，不仅在车间内部常要靠拉临时线解决问题，差不多每个车间的电力系统都得经过一番“临时”的过程，有的需要两三个月，有的需要一年半载，这笔若干亿元的临时线路的投资，就是我们的设计和施工没有按着应有的程序办事所付出的代价。电话不灵也是同样的道理。按照设计，全厂通讯系统有调度电话、厂长电话、普通自动电话，以及广播网等等，但是这些系统至今还没有建立起来，工作上却又不能一天没有电话，因此只得临时解决。当然，像生产科、材料科那些业务纷繁的部门，一两台靠交换台传呼的电话是难以解决问题的。
    实际上“三不”歌谣反映的还仅是问题的一小部分，厂里其他公用设备和福利设施的建立差不多都是落在需要后边的。厂房大部分都盖起来了，锅炉只安装了设计容量的三分之一，蒸汽供不上需要，车间暖风不能经常开放，许多新车间里冻上了冰。压缩空气机也只安了不到设计容量的一半，空气压力维持不住。保险水源还正在设计，城市水源有问题时，不能保证二十四小时供水。而水、电、汽、风二十四小时无间断地供应，正是一个制造工厂维持生产的基本条件。福利设施不配合的情况也一样严重，宿舍的增加始终与职工人数的增加不成比例，登记了好几个月得不到房子住的人也不少。正式的食堂今年才计划修建，工人已在仓库中挤着吃饭快两年了。其他如医疗所、托儿所、合作社、浴室等等，或者根本没有建立，或者虽已建立，但远不能满足需要。因为这些物质条件不具备，厂里为了职工生活福利问题常感到困难。当然，这里并不是说要“福利第一”，但是与工厂建设的发展相适应的福利设施，是有必要而且必须及时予以考虑的。
      设计是永久的，厂里需要自己搞临时的
    必须承认，生产是不断前进的，因此也是不断变化的，尤其在像我们主要是单一生产的工厂里，实际生产的产品不可能按照工厂设计的产品方案一成不变。当实际生产超出了新厂设计规定的产品方案范围时，难免要增加一些相应的设备和作一定的技术措施。譬如我们在中型电机车间制造较大的六千瓩水轮发电机时，就曾这样做过，这是容易理解的，也是比较合理的。可是我要谈的是另外一种情况：仅仅是因为某一部分设计还没有完成，但是生产上又急迫需要，只好来个临时措施。譬如说，按照设计，厂里要有煤气供应，因此焊件退火炉、锻工焖炉、铸钢件退火炉、泥芯烘炉、加热炉等等，全厂不下数十台设备按设计要用煤气，而且好些煤气管路也已经安上了，可是煤气站还刚开始设计。显然，我们的铸工、锻工、电焊等等车间不能等到有了煤气才开工，于是设计部门通知我们，设计是永久性的，厂里生产需要搞临时的，不得已时我们也只好这样做了。熔钢炉已经生产了，通风设计图还未出来，我们装临时通风。工具车间恒温室的设备还没有详细规格，但是精密机器已经搬进去要开动了，房间内冻得伸不出手来，只好临时加装暖气包。锅炉房运煤设备赶不及，我们安临时吊车。产品出来了，还没有成品仓库，只好将电机东堆西放勉强对付。临时应付惯了，设计就失却了严肃性，有些地方我们索性将设计部门扔在一边自己干了起来。这样做法是不对的，以后要尽量注意防止。但是无论设计部门同意我们的临时措施也好，我们自作主张的临时措施也好，不管怎样总得需要一笔投资；等正式设计出来时，又得拆除旧的，建立新的；有的还要暂时停工，影响生产。这笔损失，我们没有详尽地计算，如果统计一下，无疑将会令人大吃一惊。
    总体计划和合理的建设程序
    上面所举的仅是一些典型的事例，但就这些事例，就已足够使我们体会到为什么建厂一定要有周密的总体计划和合理的建设程序。所谓建厂总体计划，据我们的了解，就是建厂工程的设计和施工总的轮廓和程序。设计部门和建设单位应该根据初步设计所规定的工程工作量和国家要求完成的建厂期限，对全厂单位工程的设计和施工以及车间开工的生产准备工作，作出适当的安排。这个计划的制订，要考虑到国家投资最经济合理的使用，年度工程量相对合理的分布，公用设施与生产单位之间的配合，辅助车间与主要车间之间的配合，各个车间开工日期的先后顺序，生产技术的准备，以及人员的培养训练等等。根据我们体会到的规律，全厂性的供水、供汽、电力、通讯系统等等公用设施，应该首先建成；公路铁路以及一部分仓库也应先车间而建立，因为这些工程不仅生产一开始就必需，而且基本建设工程中就需用它们。车间建立的次序，最先应该是工具车间和修配车间，因为工具生产一定要比产品生产提前一个阶段，修配车间的提前建立，可以给其他车间的机器安装增加很大的方便；其次是准备车间，如铸工、锻工、冷作车间等，以便加工车间有足够的供应；最后才是机械加工车间、装配车间以及试验车间。只有在辅助车间及准备车间的充分支援和及时配合之下，生产车间才能真正发挥它的能力。在建立厂区工程的同时，就应考虑各个时期内人员的增长，从而规定宿舍、食堂、办公室以及其他种种福利设施分期建设的计划。只有在总体计划指导之下，才有可能免除返工和搞临时工程及勉强应付等等不合理的现象。不消说，一边设计一边施工的方法更是不应该采用的。
    不仅单位工程要有一定的先后次序，在一个单位工程内，也必须按照一定的程序来设计施工。譬如在一个车间内，车间变电所、动力管路、取暖系统等等，正如全厂的公用设施应尽先建立一样，也必须首先安装好。重型车间内的吊车设备，必须在其他安装工程开始以前就开动，不然重型机器就无法安装。部分生产开始以前，基础和地坪一定应该打好，而在打地坪之前，电力支线、单台设备的动力管路以及安全接地网等地下埋设工程不可稍有遗漏，不然一面打好一面凿开的现象将难以避免。这些看来都是显而易见的道理，但在我们却都是从一件件沉痛的事件中得来的教训。在我们建厂的过程中，关于设计和施工上的技术问题，曾多次请教过各方面的苏联专家，但是在建厂总体计划和建设程序这个重要问题上，却忽视了取得苏联专家的指导。从最近某些苏联专家所提供的建议和资料中，说明我们的老师苏联在这方面也是积累了一套完整的经验的，如果我们能及时搜集这方面的资料和争取专家的指导，相信一定要少走很多的弯路。建厂工作对我们是一段摸索的过程，我们些微的经验教训的获得，是花了浩大的代价的，希望全国的设计单位和建设单位，要注意建厂总体计划和建设程序，不要重蹈我们的覆辙。
