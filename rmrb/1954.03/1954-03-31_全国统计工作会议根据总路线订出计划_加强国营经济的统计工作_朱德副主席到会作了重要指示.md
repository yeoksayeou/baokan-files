    [This Newspaper’s News] The State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government convened the Third National Statistical Work Conference from February 16th to March 5th.

    The conference heard a report by Xue Muqiao, Director of the State Statistical Bureau, on "Review of 1953 Work and Key Points of 1954 Work." In his report, Xue Muqiao first pointed out that under the correct leadership of the Central Government and Party committees at all levels, and relying on the joint efforts of statistical workers nationwide and the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, the statistical departments have basically completed the glorious tasks assigned by the state. He said that the statistical work of the past year has been successful, but there are still many shortcomings in the work. The main shortcomings of the State Statistical Bureau in terms of leadership are: insufficient grasp of the correct principles of the Second National Statistical Work Conference in specific implementation, the statistical methods and systems formulated are still very rough, insufficient attention is paid to the research and analysis of statistical data, and the business leadership of statistical agencies at all levels and statistical agencies of various business departments is weak.

    Regarding the statistical work for 1954, Xue Muqiao pointed out that it must be carried out in accordance with the spirit of the general line of the state during the transition period, the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, and this year's annual plan. The statistical work of the transition period should correctly reflect the gradual realization of the general line. Different survey and statistical methods should be adopted for different economic components during the transition period, closely combined with planning work, and the statistical work should be continuously improved as the proportion of the socialist economy continues to increase. Based on this principle, the central task for 1954 is to continue to strengthen the statistical work of the state-owned economy—especially state-owned industry and capital construction—and accordingly strengthen the statistical work of material distribution, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, transportation, and social, cultural, educational, and health undertakings; to do a good job in the statistical work of labor wages, financial costs; to improve the statistical work of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce; and to strengthen the statistical work of mutual aid and cooperation and state capitalism. In addition, temporary surveys will be conducted when necessary. In order to complete the above tasks, Xue Muqiao pointed out that it is necessary to continue to improve survey and statistical methods, study and analyze, strengthen the statistical work of grass-roots units and business departments, and strive to train national statistical cadres and improve their political understanding and business capabilities.

    During the conference, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission Li Fuchun, and Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Lu Dingyi successively attended the conference and gave instructions.

    In his instructions, Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out that statistical work is a scientific and systematic social survey. In planned economic construction, statistical workers bear a major responsibility. Statistical work has been successful in the past year, but it is far from meeting the needs of planned economic construction. Therefore, Party and government organs and business departments at all levels must strengthen the leadership of statistical work, continue to enrich statistical agencies, and strengthen statistical work. In order to end the intolerable chaos in past statistical data, strict statistical work discipline must be established, and various important statistical figures should be uniformly controlled by statistical agencies and be responsible for supply.

    Li Fuchun, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission, gave instructions in response to the issues raised at the conference. He first pointed out that the gradual realization of socialist construction and socialist transformation during the transition period is also a gradual construction process of statistical work. In this rather long process, the steps must be steady, the methods must be diverse, the focus must be grasped, and a regular statistical system must be established for the socialist economy and semi-socialist economy; and for other non-socialist economic components, typical surveys and other methods must still be adopted. In the country's planned construction, statistics must serve the country's plan well and regard it as the main basic task. In order to complete this glorious task, first, accurate statistical data must be provided; second, research and analysis must be conducted to discover problems; and third, solutions to problems must be proposed, so that the role of inspection and supervision can be truly played. At present, the first step has not yet been done well. Therefore, it is required that national statistical cadres be specialized, settle down to work, study business, and continuously improve their working ability.

    Through this conference, the participants further clarified the principles and tasks of statistical work during the transition period. The 1954 statistical work plan formulated based on this general principle and task has been carefully discussed and studied at the meeting, and guarantees for specific implementation have been obtained. Everyone believes that in order to complete the work tasks for 1954, it is necessary to continue to enrich statistical agencies, strengthen statistical work, and especially strengthen the statistical agencies and statistical work of business departments and grass-roots enterprises. It is also believed that training cadres is the key to improving work in the future. Statistical agencies above the provincial and municipal levels and business departments must make specific plans for the rotation training of cadres and take effective measures to solve this problem.

    Before the end of the conference, Lu Dingyi, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a report on the general line of the transition period. In his report, he pointed out the breadth and depth of socialist transformation, answered the questions raised at the meeting, and focused on elaborating on the policies of socialist transformation for agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. He also called on everyone to strengthen unity and strive to successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Party under the illumination of the general line and following the instructions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, with a humble attitude and a spirit of self-criticism.

    全国统计工作会议根据总路线订出计划
    加强国营经济的统计工作
    朱德副主席到会作了重要指示
    【本报讯】中央人民政府国家统计局在二月十六日到三月五日召开了第三届全国统计工作会议。
    会议听了国家统计局局长薛暮桥关于“一九五三年工作检讨和一九五四年工作要点”的报告。薛暮桥在报告中首先指出：一年来在中央和各级党政的正确领导下，依靠全国统计工作人员的共同努力和苏联专家的热情帮助，统计部门基本上完成了国家所交给的光荣任务。他说，一年来的统计工作是有成绩的，但工作中还有不少缺点。国家统计局在领导方面的主要缺点是：在具体执行第二届全国统计工作会议的正确方针上掌握得不够稳，所制订的统计工作方法制度还很粗糙，对统计资料的研究分析注意不够，对各级统计机构和各业务部门统计机构的业务领导薄弱。
    关于一九五四年的统计工作，薛暮桥指出：必须根据国家过渡时期的总路线、第一个五年计划的基本任务的精神和今年的年度计划来进行。过渡时期的统计工作应正确地反映总路线的逐步实现过程，对过渡时期的不同经济成份应采用不同的调查统计方法，密切与计划工作结合，在社会主义经济比重不断增长的过程中来不断提高统计工作。根据这一方针，一九五四年的中心任务是：继续加强国营经济—特别是国营工业和基本建设的统计工作，相应地加强物资分配、国营商业和合作社商业、交通运输业及社会文教卫生统计工作，做好劳动工资、财务成本的统计工作，改进个体农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的统计工作，加强互助合作和国家资本主义的统计工作。此外，必要时还将进行一些临时调查工作。为了完成上述任务，薛暮桥指出：必须继续改进调查统计方法，学习分析研究，加强基层单位和业务部门的统计工作，努力培养全国统计干部，提高他们的政治认识和业务能力。
    会议期间，中央人民政府副主席朱德，国家计划委员会副主席李富春，中共中央宣传部副部长陆定一先后到会作了指示。
    朱德副主席在指示中指出：统计工作是一种科学的系统的社会调查，在有计划的经济建设中，统计工作人员负有重大的责任。一年来统计工作是有成绩的，但还远不能满足有计划的经济建设的需要，因此，各级党政机关和业务部门必须加强对统计工作的领导，继续充实统计机构，加强统计工作。为了终止过去统计资料中不能容忍的混乱现象，必须建立严格的统计工作纪律，各种重要统计数字应由统计机关统一掌握，负责供给。
    国家计划委员会副主席李富春，针对会议中所提出的问题，作了指示。他首先指出：过渡时期社会主义建设和社会主义改造的逐步实现过程，也就是统计工作的逐步建设过程。在这一个相当长的过程中，步骤要稳，方法要多，要掌握重点，对社会主义经济和半社会主义经济要建立正规的统计制度；而对其它非社会主义经济成份，还必须采用典型调查等方法。在国家有计划的建设中，统计必须很好地为国家计划服务，并把它当作主要的基本的任务。为了完成这一光荣任务，第一要提供正确的统计资料，第二要研究分析发现问题，第三要提出解决问题的办法，这样才能真正起到检查监督的作用。目前第一步还未作好，因此，要求全国统计干部专业化，安心工作，钻研业务，不断提高自己的工作能力。
    通过这次会议，到会人员进一步明确认识了过渡时期统计工作的方针任务。根据这个总的方针任务所拟订的一九五四年的统计工作计划，经过会议的认真讨论研究，获得了具体实现的保证。大家认为：为了完成一九五四年工作任务，必须继续充实统计机构，加强统计工作，特别要加强业务部门和基层企业的统计机构和统计工作。并且认为：培养干部是今后提高工作的关键，省市以上和业务部门的统计机构必须作出轮训干部的具体计划，并采取有效措施来解决这一个问题。
    会议结束前，中共中央宣传部副部长陆定一作了关于过渡时期总路线的报告，他在报告中指出了社会主义改造的广泛性和深刻性，解答了会上提出的问题，着重阐述了对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的政策。并号召大家在总路线的照耀下，遵循着党的四中全会的指示，以谦逊的态度和自我批评的精神，加强团结，为胜利完成党所交给的任务而努力。
