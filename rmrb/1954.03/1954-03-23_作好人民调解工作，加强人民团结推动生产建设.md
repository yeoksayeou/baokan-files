Unity is strength. Unity is the power to drive the masses of the people to engage in production and construction. Under the leadership and education of party committees and people's governments at all levels, especially after successive social reform movements, the political awareness of the Chinese people has greatly improved, and the majority of the people have been able to consciously abide by state laws, decrees, and policies. Therefore, disputes among the masses have decreased compared with before liberation, and the internal unity of the people has been unprecedentedly strengthened. However, the number of cases accepted by basic-level people's governments and basic-level people's courts has increased year by year. This is because: During the period of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the courts were reactionary ruling institutions that oppressed the people. They not only had a set of cumbersome litigation systems that were inconvenient for the people, but also extorted and exploited the people in every possible way, arbitrarily bullying and infringing upon the people. Therefore, people generally did not want to file lawsuits when disputes arose. After the liberation of the whole country, since the government and the courts belong to the people themselves, the masses are generally willing to ask the people's government to resolve disputes, or to file lawsuits in the people's courts. The vast majority of these civil disputes are related to land, housing, mountains, forests, water conservancy, marriage, and debt issues. If they cannot be resolved promptly and correctly, they will affect the unity among the masses and hinder their production and work, and may even lead to fighting and homicides. Such adverse consequences are obviously detrimental to the development of production. Therefore, the people's governments and the people's courts have the responsibility to properly resolve these civil disputes, and must not ignore them as trivial matters. However, if all civil disputes are to be resolved by district and township people's governments and basic-level people's courts, that is impossible, and some effective organizational forms and working methods must be adopted to resolve them. The people's mediation committee, created by the masses, is a good organizational form that is both convenient for resolving civil disputes and convenient for implementing the mass line in judicial work. It is a mass organization for the people to conduct self-education.

According to the experience of areas that established this kind of civil mediation work earlier and achieved better results, implementing this method has the following benefits: First, because the mediation organization is located in the local township, the mediators are familiar with the situation and can easily absorb the opinions of the masses, so they can handle problems more promptly and greatly save the masses time in appealing to the government or the court. According to incomplete statistics from the Sichuan Provincial People's Court, the people's mediation committees in 117 counties resolved more than 40,000 civil disputes between January and September 1953. If these civil disputes had to be resolved by the people's court or the people's government, not only would they not be resolved in a timely manner, but the money spent by the masses traveling back and forth between the county seat and the countryside, and the production time wasted, would also be incalculable losses. Second, through mediation, the people's mediation committee can conduct propaganda and education on policies and laws for the masses, enabling them to become familiar with policies and laws, improve their political awareness and sense of law-abiding, strengthen internal unity among the people, and prevent and reduce the occurrence of civil disputes and criminal acts, which is also beneficial to production and construction. Because Pingzheng County, Shanxi Province, has done a good job in civil mediation and paid attention to propaganda and education, the masses reported: "Disputes are decreasing year by year, and grain is increasing year by year." The People's Mediation Committee of Zhaixi Township, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, mediated a water conservancy dispute last year when there was a drought in July. At the same time, it publicized the people's government's policy of fighting drought and protecting autumn harvests, explained the principle that farmers should unite and help each other, and as a result, the masses automatically negotiated a reasonable water use system, fundamentally solving the problem. Due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places, some places have now begun to distribute people's mediation committee members to mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives to assist in resolving disputes between group members and cooperative members, and to conduct socialist education through mediation, which has promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Third, doing a good job in people's mediation work also has a very important role in improving the work of basic-level regimes and basic-level courts. If civil disputes are to be resolved by basic-level regimes or basic-level courts, many district and township cadres will not be able to concentrate their efforts on leading the people in various production and construction projects, and basic-level courts will not be able to concentrate their efforts on handling some major cases. Even if these cadres are busy mediating civil disputes all day long, they will still have a backlog of cases and cause dissatisfaction among the masses. Doing a good job in people's mediation work can greatly reduce the time spent by district and township cadres in mediating mass disputes, and can concentrate their efforts on leading the masses in production and construction. Therefore, people's mediation organizations that truly play a role are generally welcomed and valued by district and township cadres; for basic-level people's courts, they significantly reduce the number of cases accepted, and can concentrate their efforts on handling major cases that seriously violate state policies and laws and undermine economic construction.

It is precisely because people's mediation work has such importance that the Second National Judicial Conference held last April determined that the establishment and improvement of people's mediation committees in cities and villages across the country in a guided and planned manner should be an important task in people's judicial construction in the future, and also an important task for district and township party organizations and regime organizations in mobilizing the masses to further participate in regime construction. The "Provisional Organizational Regulations for People's Mediation Committees" promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government now more specifically stipulates the nature, tasks, scope of authority, organization, and principles of work of the people's mediation committees, so that the people's mediation committees have a clear basis when carrying out their work.

In order to smoothly carry out people's mediation work in the future, we should first correct some cadres' erroneous views on this work. During the anti-"Five Excesses" campaign in rural areas last year, some places regarded people's mediation committees as redundant organizations and canceled or merged them into other organizations without considering the actual situation. The occurrence of this phenomenon is mainly because some cadres do not understand the role of people's mediation committees, and at the same time misinterpret the meaning of anti-"Five Excesses." The "Five Excesses" are the product of subjectivism and commandism, which are a burden on the masses and basic-level cadres, affecting their production and work, and should of course be resolutely opposed. However, people's mediation committees that truly play a role not only do not increase the burden on the masses and cadres, but are organizations that are urgently needed by the masses and basic-level regimes and basic-level courts, and are conducive to production and work. Some people's mediation committees do not play a role, mainly because the local people's courts and people's governments lack leadership over them, and must not generally negate the role of people's mediation committees for this reason. Since last year, although some places have canceled the people's mediation committees, they still "exist in name but not in reality" among the masses; some places have accepted the demands of the masses and restored them.

The people's mediation committee is a mass organization that resolves civil disputes by the people using methods of criticism and self-criticism under the guidance of the district and township people's governments and basic-level people's courts, and is not a judicial organ. Its task is to mediate general civil disputes and minor criminal cases, and to conduct propaganda and education on policies and laws for the masses through daily mediation work, in order to prevent and reduce the occurrence of civil disputes and criminal acts. Therefore, the people's mediation committee must resolutely implement the three principles stipulated in the Provisional Organizational Regulations for People's Mediation Committees when carrying out its work: handle affairs in accordance with the policies and laws of the people's government, and do not conduct mediation without principles; mediation must be based on the voluntary participation of both parties concerned, and must not force mediation, nor force the parties to fulfill the mediation "agreement"; mediation is not a necessary procedure for litigation, and must not prevent the parties from filing lawsuits in the people's court because they have not been mediated or mediation has failed. In the past, the people's mediation committees in many places correctly implemented these principles, and the mediation work achieved remarkable results, and was welcomed and supported by the local masses. However, there are also some people's mediation committees that have violated these principles, using pressure on the parties concerned, or adopting rough methods such as "holding struggle meetings" and "passing by raising hands" to force the parties to accept and fulfill the mediation "agreement"; or failing to conduct appropriate criticism and education on the erroneous opinions of one of the parties, but adopting an attitude of blindly accommodating, resulting in unsuccessful mediation, or mediation agreements that do not conform to policies and laws and damage the interests of the other party concerned; there are also mediators who mistakenly believe that the people's mediation committee is a judicial organization at a certain level, and has the same power as the people's court, and therefore there have been undesirable phenomena such as "those who have not been mediated are not allowed to file lawsuits," "restricting lawsuits," "cases cannot leave the village," "lawsuits must be introduced by the district and village," and treating mediation agreements as judgments and forcing the parties to enforce them. These errors must be resolutely corrected in order to correctly exert the role of people's mediation work, help resolve civil disputes, and avoid harming the interests of the masses and causing dissatisfaction among the people with the government. In the future, in addition to promptly correcting and revoking cases that should not be mediated or are improperly mediated, the people's courts in various places must also organize mediators to study the "Provisional Organizational Regulations for People's Mediation Committees," and educate mediators with typical examples, in order to improve their policy and ideological level and working ability, and prevent the occurrence of errors.

According to the experience of various places over the years, the basic key to doing a good job in people's mediation work lies in the leadership of party and government at all levels, especially the basic-level people's courts and district and township people's governments must strengthen specific guidance on this work. In the past, the people's courts in many places did not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of people's mediation work, and established people's mediation committees solely from the perspective of assisting the court in clearing up backlog cases. After the work of clearing up backlog cases was completed, they rarely led this work. There are also some people's courts that are not cautious enough in carrying out people's mediation work, and only issue a document, requiring the lower levels to generally establish mediation organizations, but afterwards, due to insufficient subjective strength, they relax their leadership. As a result, some people's mediation committees are not pure in organization, are controlled and manipulated by a small number of bad elements, and use them to harm the people. Some of them are due to the poor ability of the mediators, lacking a certain level of policy and ideological understanding, and not understanding the nature and tasks of people's mediation work, so that some people's mediation committees are nominal and formalistic, or there are deviations such as not handling affairs according to principles. The people's courts in various places should remember these lessons and adopt a positive but steady approach in carrying out people's mediation work in the future. In areas where land reform has been completed, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is relatively thorough, and mediation organizations have not yet been established, the cities should use streets as units, and the rural areas should use townships as units, and the local people's courts should cooperate with the district and township people's governments to establish people's mediation committees in a guided, focused, and step-by-step manner. Never repeat the mistakes of "spreading out all at once, difficult to lead" and becoming formalistic. In places where the conditions for establishing a people's mediation organization are not yet available, civil disputes can be resolved through district and township people's representative conferences, people's congresses, and other mass organizations, and there is no need to rush to establish a people's mediation committee. For mediation committees that have been established but do not play a role, or have impure organizations and bad work styles, the local people's courts should use the opportunity of going to the countryside to handle cases or conducting circuit trials to obtain the active assistance of the district and township people's governments, conduct in-depth understanding, grasp the actual situation, and jointly rectify them in a guided and step-by-step manner to make them sound and pure. After the people's mediation committee is established or after rectification, the district and township people's governments and basic-level people's courts must conscientiously strengthen their leadership over it ideologically, politically, and organizationally, and regularly supervise and inspect its work. According to the experience of various places, the most important way for the people's court to lead the mediation committee is through circuit courts. The courts in various places should regard leading mediation work as one of the regular and important tasks of the circuit court.

Establishing and improving people's mediation work in a guided and step-by-step manner to reduce and timely handle civil disputes, strengthen patriotic and law-abiding education among the people, enhance internal unity and cooperation among the people, enable the masses to concentrate their efforts on production and construction, and enable basic-level regime cadres to concentrate their efforts on leading production and construction, is of great importance for gradually realizing the country's general line and general task during the transition period. The people's courts in various places should regard carrying out people's mediation work as one of the regular and important tasks, and actively cooperate with the basic-level people's governments to do it well.

### 作好人民调解工作，加强人民团结推动生产建设

    作好人民调解工作，加强人民团结推动生产建设
    团结就是力量。团结是推动人民群众进行生产建设的力量。在各级党委和人民政府的领导和教育之下，特别是经过历次的社会改革运动，我国人民的政治觉悟已有很大的提高，大多数的人民群众都已能自觉地遵守国家的法律、法令和各种政策，因而群众之间的纠纷已较解放以前减少，人民内部的团结已空前地加强。但是，基层人民政府和基层人民法院的收案数量却年年上升。这是因为：在国民党反动统治的时期，法院是压迫人民的反动统治机构，它不仅有一套繁琐的不便于人民的诉讼制度，而且百般地对人民敲诈勒索，任意地欺压和侵害人民。因此人民有了纠纷一般都不愿起诉。全国解放以后，由于政府和法院是人民自己的，群众有了纠纷，一般都愿意请求人民政府解决，或到人民法院起诉。这些民间纠纷绝大多数是有关土地、房屋、山林、水利、婚姻和债务等问题的，如不能得到及时的和正确的解决，就会影响群众之间的团结，妨害他们的生产和工作，有时甚至会因此酿成械斗和凶杀等不良后果，这对于发展生产显然是不利的。因此，对于这些民间纠纷，人民政府和人民法院有责任加以妥善的解决，决不能以为这些都是琐屑小事而置之不理。但是，如果所有的民间纠纷，都要区乡人民政府和基层人民法院来解决，那是不可能的，必须采取一些有效的组织形式和工作方法来加以解决。由群众所创造的人民调解委员会，就是一个既便于解决民间纠纷，又便于在司法工作中贯彻群众路线的良好组织形式。它是人民进行自我教育的群众性组织。
    根据建立这种民间调解工作较早、工作成绩也较好的地区的经验，实行这种办法有以下几种好处：第一，因为调解组织就在本乡本地，调解人员熟悉情况，又容易吸收群众意见，所以处理问题比较及时，而且大大节省群众到政府或法院去申诉的时间。仅据四川省人民法院不完全的统计，一百一十七个县的人民调解委员会，在一九五三年一月到九月之间，就解决了民间纠纷四万多件。如果这些民间纠纷都要到人民法院或人民政府解决，不仅是解决不及时，而且群众往返于县城和农村之间所耗费的金钱和所耽误的生产时间，也是无法计算的损失。第二，通过调解，人民调解委员会可以对群众进行政策法令的宣传教育，使他们熟悉政策法令，提高政治觉悟和守法观念，加强人民内部的团结，预防和减少民间纠纷和犯罪行为的发生，这对于生产建设也是有利的。山西省平顺县因为民间调解工作作得好，并且注意了宣传教育，群众反映是：
  “纠纷一年比一年少，粮食一年比一年多。”浙江省桐庐县窄溪乡人民调解委员会在去年七月天旱时调解了一件水利纠纷，同时向群众宣传了人民政府抗旱保秋的政策，说明了农民应当团结互助的道理，结果群众自动商议出一个合理的用水制度，从根本上解决了这一问题。由于各地互助合作运动的发展，现在有的地方已经开始把人民调解委员分布到互助组和农业生产合作社中去，协助解决组员之间和社员之间的纠纷，并通过调解进行社会主义的教育，这就推动了互助合作运动的发展。第三，作好人民调解工作对改进基层政权和基层法院的工作也有很重大的作用。如果民间纠纷都要由基层政权或基层法院来解决，许多区乡干部就不能集中力量去领导人民进行各项生产建设，基层法院也就不能集中力量去处理一些重大案件，而且即使这些干部整天忙于调解民间纠纷，仍然会积案累累，引起群众不满。作好了人民调解工作，就可以大大减少区乡干部为调解群众的纠纷而花费的时间，可以集中力量领导群众进行生产建设，因而凡是真正起作用的人民调解组织，普遍受到区乡干部的欢迎和重视；对于基层人民法院来说，则是显著地减少了收案数量，可以集中力量处理严重违犯国家政策法令和破坏经济建设的重大案件。
    正是由于人民调解工作具有这样的重要性，去年四月召开的第二届全国司法会议曾确定：在全国的城市和乡村中，有领导有计划地建立和健全人民调解委员会，应是今后人民司法建设中的一项重要工作，也是区乡党组织和政权组织在发动群众进一步参加政权建设的一项重要工作。现在中央人民政府政务院公布的“人民调解委员会暂行组织通则”，更具体地规定了人民调解委员会的性质、任务、职权范围、组织和进行工作的原则，使人民调解委员会在进行工作时有了明确的依据。
    为了在今后顺利地开展人民调解工作，应该首先纠正一部分干部对于这一工作的错误看法。去年农村反“五多”时，有些地方曾经把人民调解委员会当成多余的组织，不看实际情况，一律取消或并入其他组织。这种现象的发生，主要是由于有些干部不了解人民调解委员会的作用，同时也曲解了反
  “五多”的意义。“五多”是主观主义和命令主义的产物，对于群众和基层干部都是一种负担，影响了他们的生产和工作，当然应该坚决反掉。但是真正起作用的人民调解委员会却不仅不加重群众和干部的负担，而且是群众和基层政权、基层法院所迫切需要的、有利于生产和工作的组织。有一部分人民调解委员会不起作用，则主要是当地人民法院和人民政府对它们缺乏领导所致，决不能因此就一般地否定了人民调解委员会的作用。去年以来，有的地方虽然把人民调解委员会取消了，但它在群众中还是“名亡实存”；有的地方则接受群众的要求，把它恢复起来了。
    人民调解委员会是在区乡人民政府和基层人民法院的指导下，由人民采用批评和自我批评的方法解决民间纠纷的群众性组织，而不是司法机关。它的任务是调解一般的民事纠纷和轻微的刑事案件，并通过日常的调解工作对群众进行政策法令的宣传教育，以预防和减少民间纠纷和犯罪行为的发生。因此人民调解委员会在进行工作时，必须坚决执行人民调解委员会暂行组织通则中所规定的三个原则：按照人民政府的政策法令办事，不得无原则地进行调解；调解必须出于当事人双方的自愿，不得强迫调解，也不得强迫当事人履行调解“协议”；调解不是诉讼的必经程序，不得因未经调解或调解不成而阻止当事人向人民法院起诉。过去很多地方的人民调解委员会正确执行了这些原则，调解工作就获得了显著的成绩，受到当地群众的欢迎和拥护。但是，也有一些地方的人民调解委员会违背了这些原则，对当事人使用压力，或采取“开斗争会”和“举手通过”等粗暴方式，强制当事人接受和履行调解“协议”；或者是对当事人一方的错误意见不敢进行适当的批评和教育，而采取一味迁就的态度，结果调解不成，或调解协议不符合政策法令，损害了当事人另一方的利益；还有的调解人员误以为人民调解委员会是一级司法组织，和人民法院具有同等的权力，因而发生了“未经调解者，不准起诉”，“限制起诉”，“案子不能出村”，“起诉要经区村介绍”，以及把调解协议当成判决书，强制当事人执行等不应有的现象。必须坚决纠正这些错误，才能正确地发挥人民调解工作的作用，有助于民间纠纷的解决，而不致损害群众的利益，引起人民对政府的不满。各地人民法院今后除应及时纠正和撤消不该调解和调解不当的案件外，还必须组织调解人员学习“人民调解委员会暂行组织通则”，以典型事例教育调解人员，借以提高他们的政策思想水平和工作能力，防止错误的发生。
    根据历年来各地的经验，要作好人民调解工作，基本关键在各级党政的领导，特别是基层人民法院和区乡人民政府要加强对这一工作的具体指导。过去有不少地方的人民法院对人民调解工作的重要性认识不足，单纯从协助法院清理积案的观点出发而建立人民调解委员会。在清理积案工作完成后，就很少去领导这一工作。还有一些地方的人民法院，对于开展人民调解工作不够慎重，仅发一纸公文，就要下面普遍建立起调解组织，而事后则因主观力量不够，放松了领导。结果是部分人民调解委员会组织不纯，为少数坏分子所把持、操纵，利用它来危害人民。有的则因调解人员的能力较差，缺乏一定的政策思想水平，对人民调解工作的性质、任务等也不够了解，使部分人民调解委员会形同虚设，流于形式，或者发生了不按原则办事等偏向。各地人民法院应记取这些教训，在今后开展人民调解工作时采取积极的而又是稳步前进的方针。凡是土地改革已经完成、镇压反革命比较彻底而尚未建立调解组织的地区，城市以街道为单位，农村以乡为单位，由当地人民法院协同区乡人民政府，有领导有重点有步骤地建立起人民调解委员会。绝不要重蹈“一下铺开、难于领导”而流于形式的覆辙。凡是尚未具备建立人民调解组织的条件的地方，可以通过区乡人民代表会议、人民代表大会及其他群众性组织以解决民间纠纷，不要急于去建立人民调解委员会。对于已建立而不起作用、或组织不纯、作风恶劣的调解委员会，当地人民法院应利用下乡办案或巡回审判的机会，取得区乡人民政府的积极协助，经过深入了解，掌握确实情况，共同有领导有步骤地切实加以整顿，使之健全和纯洁起来。在人民调解委员会建立起来或经过整顿以后，区乡人民政府和基层人民法院必须认真地从思想上、政治上和组织上加强对它的领导，并经常督促和检查其工作。根据各地的经验，人民法院领导调解委员会的最主要方式，就是通过巡回法庭。各地法院应该把领导调解工作当作巡回法庭的经常重要任务之一。
    有领导有步骤地建立和健全人民调解工作，以减少和及时处理民间纠纷，加强人民中的爱国守法教育，增进人民内部的团结合作，使人民群众能够集中力量从事生产建设，使基层政权干部能集中精力领导生产建设，对于逐步实现国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务是有重要作用的。各地人民法院应把开展人民调解工作当作经常的重要任务之一，积极协同基层人民政府把它作好。
