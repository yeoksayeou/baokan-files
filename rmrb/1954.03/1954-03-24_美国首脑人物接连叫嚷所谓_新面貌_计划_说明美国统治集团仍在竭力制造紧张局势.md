Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: Recently, leading figures in the American government, from Eisenhower and Dulles to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, have successively published articles, given speeches, and testified before Congress, touting the so-called "New Look" plan. These articles and speeches illustrate that the American ruling clique is unwilling to peacefully resolve international problems and is still striving to promote a "policy of strength" that continues to create international tension.

Last week, Dulles specially wrote an article for the "Foreign Affairs Quarterly" to be published in April and released his talks at press conferences and his speeches before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, boasting about this "New Look" policy. Dulles explained that the "New Look" plan is a "long-term plan" to develop so-called "defense forces" "at a rate that can maintain, rather than exhaust, the economic strength of our allies and ourselves." However, when Dulles exemplified the meaning of this "defense," he cited examples of American aggressive deployments around the world, such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the US-Japan and US-South Korea (Syngman Rhee) and US-Philippines military treaties, and the Turkish-Pakistani military agreement established under US instigation, proving that the entire plan is aimed at aggression against other countries. He also emphasized that maintaining military bases in other countries is a "concrete manifestation" of this military plan. When talking about the implementation of this plan in Europe and Asia, Dulles emphasized that the United States would station a "highly mobile navy, air force, and amphibious force" in Asia. He reiterated that the United States wants to maintain its occupation of Okinawa. In Europe, Dulles said that the United States wants to urge the European Defense Community to be established quickly. He stated that the United States intends to maintain a large number of troops in Europe, "on the one hand, to support the forward strategy of defense, and on the other hand, for political reasons," which is actually to put pressure on France to approve the European army quickly. In his article, Dulles again clamored for big atomic air force-ism. According to this doctrine, the American strategy is to launch attacks "by means of our own choosing, at the time and place of our own choosing."

It is not accidental that Dulles chose this time to sing loudly about the "policy of strength." The situation of negotiated victory created by the Berlin Conference and the upcoming Geneva Conference has alarmed the war forces in the United States. They are shouting that peace is unfavorable to the United States. Dulles's arguments precisely illustrate that he is trying to make the somewhat relaxed international situation very tense in order to disrupt the Geneva Conference.

The American policy of continuing to create tension is also reflected in the remarks of other leading American figures.

In answering questions from reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford explained that the "New Look" military plan is "long-term preparation." He wants everyone to be prepared to endure a period of tension lasting ten, twenty, or even more years. In his testimony before the US Congress, he pointed out that this "new" strategy arose because it was necessary to establish "a strong military posture" during the "long period" of the "Cold War." He specifically explained the American plan to use the youth of other countries as cannon fodder. He said that the United States will continue to implement a so-called military "aid" plan of 3 billion to 3.5 billion US dollars each year to order its "allies," including West Germany, to expand their armies. He said that the United States hopes to rely more on the local troops of "friendly countries," "supported by a mobile American navy and air force." This means that the people who sacrifice their lives for American monopoly capital will be the French, Germans, etc. in Europe, and the people of Asian countries in Asia. He also pointed out that other countries can build and equip troops cheaper than the United States, which means that the United States can spend less money.

Using a method that saves money and manpower, and allows the people of other countries to die for them, to create tension and prepare for new wars. This is the old trick that the United States refuses to let go of. Its purpose, Dulles said very clearly: "In this long-term effort, the United States has a deep interest in guaranteeing the economic and political systems of its allies and those areas within the free world that have not assumed obligations." Translated, this sentence means that the United States not only wants to interfere in and control the political and economic systems of its allies, but also wants to interfere in and control other countries, such as the political and economic systems of some Asian countries. In a word, to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, attempting to dominate the world.

    美国首脑人物接连叫嚷所谓“新面貌”计划
    说明美国统治集团仍在竭力制造紧张局势
    【新华社二十二日讯】最近，美国政府的首脑人物，从艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯到美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，接二连三地发表文章、谈话和在国会作证的证词，吹嘘所谓“新面貌”计划。这些文章和谈话说明，美国统治集团不愿和平解决国际问题，它仍在竭力推行继续制造国际紧张局势的“实力政策”。
    上周，杜勒斯特地为四月间出版的“外交季刊”写了一篇文章，并且发表了他在记者招待会上的谈话和在美国参议院外交委员会上的发言，吹嘘这个“新面貌”政策。杜勒斯解释说，“新面貌”计划就是“用一种可以保持而不是耗尽我们盟友以及我们自己的经济力量的速度”发展所谓“防御力量”的“长期计划”。但杜勒斯在举例说明这个“防御”的含义时，举出了美国在全球的侵略部署如北大西洋公约、美日及美李（承晚）和美菲等军事条约以及在美国主使下成立的土巴军事协定等作为范例，这证明整个计划是以侵略别国为目标。他并强调美国在其他国家保持军事基地就是这种军事计划的“具体表现”。谈到这个计划在欧、亚两洲的执行时，杜勒斯强调，美国将在亚洲驻留一支具有“高度机动性的海军、空军和两栖部队”。他重申美国要保持对冲绳岛的占领。在欧洲方面，杜勒斯说美国要催促欧洲防务集团赶快建立。他表示：美国打算在欧洲保持大量军队，“一方面支持防务的前进战略，另一方面也是为了政治上的理由”，其实就是想要借此对法国施加压力，要它赶快批准欧洲军。杜勒斯在他的文章里又叫嚣了一番大原子空军主义。根据这种主义，美国的战略是用“我们所选择的手段、在我们所选择的时间和地点”发动攻击。
    杜勒斯选择这个时机高唱“实力政策”，并不是偶然的。柏林会议所造成的协商胜利的局势，和日内瓦会议将要召开，已使美国的战争势力感到惊慌。他们正在高喊和平对美国不利。杜勒斯的论调正说明他在努力想把有了一些缓和的国际局势弄得十分紧张，以便在日内瓦会议中捣乱。
    美国继续制造紧张局势的政策，也从美国其他首脑人物的言论中反映出来。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在答“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志记者问时，解释“新面貌”军事计划就是“长期准备”。他要大家准备忍受十年、二十年以至更长的紧张时期。他在美国国会作证时指出，这种“新”战略的产生是因为有必要在“冷战”的“漫长时期”建立“一种强大的军事形势”。他特别说明美国利用其他国家青年充当炮灰的计划。他说，美国将继续执行一个每年三十亿到三十五亿美元的所谓军事“援助”计划，来命令它的“盟国”、包括西德在内，扩充它们的陆军。他说，美国希望更多地依靠“友好国家”的当地军队，“而以一支机动的美国海、空军支持它们”。这就是说，为美国垄断资本牺牲性命的人，在欧洲将是法国人、德国人等，在亚洲的将是亚洲各国的人民。他又指出，其他国家能够建立和装备比美国为便宜的部队，这就是说，美国可以少花钱。
    用又省钱又不费人力，叫他国人民替死的办法来制造紧张局势，准备新战争。这就是美国死不肯放手的老算盘。其目的，杜勒斯说得很清楚：“在这种长期努力中，美国在保证它的盟国及自由世界内的那些没有承担义务的地区的经济与政治制度方面，是具有深切的利益的。”翻译出来，这句话的意思就是，美国不但要干涉和控制它的盟国的政治经济制度，并且想干涉和控制其他国家，如一些亚洲国家的政治经济制度。一句话，到处干涉别国的内政，企图称霸世界。
