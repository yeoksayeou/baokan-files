    Northeast Forest Industry Bureau Improves Timber Allocation Work
    The Northeast Forest Industry Bureau has taken concrete steps to improve timber allocation work.
    The Northeast Forestry industry bears the responsibility of supplying more than 56% of the total national basic construction and production timber needs. However, for a long time, the bureau's allocation tasks have been poorly completed, often resulting in empty allocations and non-compliance with specifications and quality. In 1953, the bureau only completed 89.4% of the planned allocation of logs of grade and above. Empty allocations were severe in each quarter, affecting user needs and disrupting railway transportation plans. On the other hand, a large amount of logs unsuitable for allocation plan requirements were stockpiled, and several sawmills were affected in production due to timber stockpiles.
    The main reason for the failure to complete the allocation tasks is that leaders at all levels of the forest industry bureau only focused on production and neglected sales. Internal organizations did not cooperate closely, and production, transportation, and sales were not well integrated. The allocation department itself did not actively establish close contact with other departments of the Forest Industry Bureau. In order to prevent empty allocations, they sometimes deliberately under-allocated, affecting user needs. Railways failed to allocate cars according to balanced plans; users blindly wanted good timber and not inferior timber, long timber and not short timber, which also affected the allocation work.
    In order to reverse this situation, the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau decided to vigorously improve timber allocation work. This year, it is required to basically eliminate the phenomenon of empty allocations and strive to reduce stockpiles. The unified allocation and planning of logs, finished timber, grade timber and off-grade timber will be the responsibility of the Northeast Timber Allocation Bureau (under the leadership of the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau). The timber allocation plan will be jointly studied and determined by the planning, production, and timber departments and incorporated into the operation plan, which will be jointly responsible for ensuring its completion by all units. Strengthen the cooperation of all units up and down the forest industry system, strengthen scheduling work, and promptly reflect problems through scheduling to solve them. Each forest industry bureau will designate a director in charge of allocation to regularly supervise and inspect, and take effective measures to ensure the integration of production, transportation, and sales. Promote advanced experience in timber allocation work. Strengthen log yard management, be aware of the situation, and actively promote the sales of off-grade timber. Vigorously carry out guaranteed delivery work (i.e., door-to-door delivery). This year, the amount of goods delivered should strive to reach 60% of the total allocation volume. In order to do the above work well, the Timber Allocation Bureau must strengthen investigation and research to understand the needs of users (especially major departments such as construction, railways, and paper making), so as to ensure supply. The Northeast Forest Industry Bureau will strengthen the inspection of lumberyards and clarify the reward and punishment system. Finally, strengthen the ideological leadership and political education of the staff of the timber allocation system, organize them to study, and improve their political level and professional ability.
    Because the leaders of the forest industry bureaus have attached importance to sales work and grasped the link of production, transportation and sales, and initially taken the above improvement measures, coupled with the fact that there were more logs stored in the lumberyards at the end of last year, the timber allocation work in January this year has improved, completing 97.1% of the national target, which is the best month for the bureau to complete the allocation task in recent years.

    东北森林工业管理局改进木材调拨工作
    东北森林工业管理局采取切实步骤改进木材调拨工作。
    东北森林工业担负着全国基本建设和生产用材总额百分之五十六以上的供应任务，但是长时期来，该局调拨任务完成情况不好，经常发生拨空及规格质量不符现象。一九五三年，该局只完成等内原木调拨计划的百分之八十九点四，各季度拨空现象都很严重，影响了用户需要，并打乱了铁路运输计划。但另一方面，不适于调拨计划要求的原木又大量积压，若干制材厂因木材积压而影响生产。
    完不成调拨任务的主要原因，是各级森林工业局领导上只顾生产，忽视推销，内部组织没有密切协作，产、运、销结合得不好。调拨部门本身也没有主动地与森林工业局其他各部门取得密切联系，为了防止拨空，有时竟故意少拨，影响用户需要。铁路不按计划平衡配车；用户盲目地要好材不要劣材，要长材不要短材，对调拨工作也有影响。
    为了扭转这一局面，东北森林工业管理局决定大力改进木材调拨工作，今年要求基本上消灭拨空现象，努力减少积压。把原木、成材和等内材、等外材的调配和计划统一由东北木材调配局（归东北森林工业管理局领导）负责，木材分配计划由计划、生产、木材部门共同研究确定，列入作业计划中，由各单位共同负责保证完成。加强森林工业系统上下左右各单位的协作，加强调度工作，通过调度及时把问题反映上来，加以解决；各森林工业局指定一个局长管调拨，经常督促检查，并采取有效措施保证产、运、销结合。推广木材调拨工作中的先进经验。加强楞场管理，做到心中有数，并积极推销等外材。大力开展保送工作（即送货到门），今年送货量争取达到全部调拨量的百分之六十。为了做好上述各项工作，木材调配局要加强调查研究，摸清用户（特别是建筑、铁路、造纸等主要部门）需材的规律，以便保证供应。东北森林工业管理局要加强对贮木场的检查，严明奖惩制度。最后，加强对木材调拨系统工作人员的思想领导和政治教育，组织他们进行学习，提高其政治水平和业务能力。
    由于各森林工业局领导上重视了推销工作，抓紧了产运销结合这一环节，初步采取了上述改进措施，加上去年年终贮木场积存原木较多，今年一月份木材调拨工作已有好转，完成了国家指标的百分之九十七点一，为该局几年来完成调拨任务最好的一个月份。
