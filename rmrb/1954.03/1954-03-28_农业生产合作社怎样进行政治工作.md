It is of course voluntary for farmers to join agricultural production cooperatives; however, this does not mean that once they join, all their ideological problems are completely resolved. Some people are voluntary, but not entirely consciously so. Some joined the cooperative by "following the crowd" with a "let's give it a try" attitude, without truly understanding the benefits of joining. Some recognize the benefits of joining, but do not understand the difficulties of running the cooperative, and may waver when faced with difficulties. Some only think about how joining the cooperative is good for them, but are unwilling to contribute all their strength for the common interests of everyone. Some have just handed over their private land, livestock, and farm tools to the cooperative for unified use, and inevitably feel a bit uneasy, always fearing that this is "giving everything away." Everyone has just changed from decentralized operation to collective operation, and inevitably feels somewhat unaccustomed.

After the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative, the relationship between people will change, and the relationship between members, between the masses of members and the leading core, will be very different from before joining the cooperative. This change will bring many ideological problems. Agricultural production cooperatives will also have close relationships with the masses outside the cooperative, with mutual aid teams, with other cooperatives, and with the state, and ideological problems will constantly arise in these relationships. Furthermore, agricultural production cooperatives are not fixed after their establishment; they must gradually expand and improve step by step, and production tools and technology must be continuously improved. In the process of expansion, improvement, and renovation, many new ideological problems will inevitably arise. If these ideological problems are not resolved, it will be impossible to run the cooperative well. To solve these ideological problems, it is necessary to do a good job in political work. (The political work mentioned here mainly refers to political and ideological education work, and also includes the propaganda work of promoting advanced agricultural technologies and the mobilization work in production.)

Doing a good job in political work is an important guarantee for running agricultural production cooperatives well, and it is also an important guarantee for the cooperatives to move towards socialism step by step. To consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives, increasing production and increasing the income of members are certainly the most fundamental and important things, but at the same time, ideological education work must also be done well. If ideological problems are not resolved, they will hinder the increase in production; if production cannot be increased, everyone's income will naturally not be increased. Moreover, if ideological problems are not resolved, even if production and income are increased, the cooperative will still not be able to consolidate; some people, after their income increases, their lives become prosperous, and they have surplus money, may withdraw from the cooperative to engage in speculative business and take the capitalist road. In order to run the cooperative well, and in order to move forward step by step, the core members and all the members should study politics and culture well, and arm their minds with advanced ideas.

From what aspects should political work be carried out?

Although there are many ideological problems among the members, in general, they are nothing more than the following issues: First, they are not familiar with the socialist road, they are not "fully confident" about whether the cooperative is good or not, and they still have some nostalgia for the old road. Second, they do not care about collective interests and national interests, and they do not understand the relationship between individual interests and the interests of the whole cooperative, the interests of all farmers, and the interests of the state. Third, they do not believe in advanced science and technology, they have conservative ideas, and they are unwilling to change backward farming methods. What kind of lock should be opened with what kind of key? How should these ideological problems be solved?

First, it is necessary to continuously carry out socialist education (including education on the two different new and old roads of socialism and capitalism, education on the worker-peasant alliance, education on the glory of labor and the shame of exploitation, education on the superiority of cooperatives, etc.). It is necessary to recognize clearly: Socialism means that no one exploits anyone, the better you work, the more you earn, and everyone becomes prosperous together. Becoming prosperous together is definitely not "equalizing" everyone according to their current living standards, but using the method of constantly increasing production to make the poor become rich, and the rich even richer. Capitalism means that a very small number of non-laborers exploit the vast majority of laborers, only a few people become rich, and most people become poor. To take the socialist road, to constantly increase production, it is necessary to follow the Communist Party, to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and to consolidate and develop cooperatives. Joining the cooperative means taking the right path. If you continue to walk along this road, you will be able to live a better and better life. However, after embarking on this road, you still have to walk it well; walking this road is not like buying a ticket and sitting on a train, where you can reach socialism without moving. Setting up a cooperative provides good conditions for increasing production, increasing income, and moving towards socialism; but if you do not work hard, are unwilling to take it one step at a time, and do not make good use of the good conditions of the cooperative, everything is still empty; if you do not engage in proper business, engage in commerce, or excessively increase the remuneration for the means of production, turning it into exploitation of labor, it will not only fail to increase production, but also lead to the wrong path of capitalism. Running a cooperative is a new thing, and everyone has changed from decentralized operation to collective operation, lacking experience, and inevitably encountering some difficulties in the process of advancing; for the sake of a more beautiful socialist life in the future, do not be afraid of these difficulties, and do not want to retreat at the slightest difficulty; as long as everyone is of one mind, the power of the masses can overcome the difficulties. If everyone truly understands these principles, they can strengthen their wavering hearts and actively participate in labor in the cooperative; the problems that may arise when the cooperative is further expanded and gradually improved will be easier to solve.

Second, it is necessary to continuously carry out collectivist and patriotic education (including education on abiding by labor discipline, education on cherishing public property, education on abiding by state laws and responding to state calls, education on supporting national industrialization, education on unity, friendship, mutual assistance between middle peasants and poor peasants, old members and new members in the cooperative, education on uniting the masses outside the cooperative, etc.). It is necessary to recognize clearly: "If the big river has no water, the small canals will dry up," any loss suffered by the cooperative is a loss for every member; if everyone treats the public affairs and public property of the cooperative with the idea of "how much can I get from my share," everyone's losses will be many, not few. Small improvements in personal life in the present should be subordinate to large improvements in the future; as production increases and income increases, the public property of the cooperative must also increase. Only when the strength of the cooperative is greater, the public accumulation fund and capital construction are more, can production be increased even more, and life can be better. In order to improve the production of the entire cooperative, everyone should consciously abide by labor discipline; labor discipline is not to tie people down, but to ensure that everyone actively labors, cooperates closely, and does not miss work or delay things. It is also necessary to recognize that the interests of all farmers are consistent; the joining of a new member strengthens the cooperative's strength, and should be welcomed, not excluded; after new members join, old members should unite with them well to expand production, and not lose sight of the big picture because of small gains. The interests of poor and middle peasants in the cooperative are also consistent, and solving all problems should start from strengthening the unity of poor and middle peasants. For laboring peasants who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative, they should also be treated as good friends, and there should be no estrangement in their hearts; as long as they are united and helped well, they will eventually become members. It is also necessary to recognize that only when the country is rich and strong and industry is developed can the lives of farmers be happier and more fulfilling. The best way for farmers to support national industrialization is to produce various agricultural products needed by the state according to the state's plan, and sell them to the state according to the state's planned purchase method. Agricultural production cooperatives have relatively large strength and scale, which is convenient for obtaining state assistance, convenient for increasing production, and convenient for carrying out production according to the state's plan. Everyone should make good use of these good conditions. If everyone understands these principles, the relationship between the cooperative internally and externally, and between the cooperative and the state, can be close, and the phenomenon of individualism and departmentalism can be gradually reduced.

Third, it is necessary to continuously promote the improvement of agricultural technology (including education on the benefits of new-style farm tools, education on the necessity of improving farming techniques, etc.). It is necessary to recognize clearly: For agricultural production cooperatives to increase production, the adoption of new-style farm tools and new technologies is of decisive significance. Agricultural production cooperatives should actively adopt new-style farm tools and new technologies to improve labor productivity. In the past, with long-term decentralized operation, it was not easy to improve farm tools and technology, and many people did not believe in the benefits of new-style farm tools and new technologies. After organizing agricultural production cooperatives, there are good conditions for improving farm tools and technology, and the superiority of the cooperative should be fully utilized in this regard; if production is still carried out using old methods, it will not be easy to increase production, and may even lead to losses. To use new technologies, everyone must have a clear understanding in their minds before they can act in unison and implement them well; if some people do not have a clear understanding and still use old methods, they will not be able to cooperate well, which will affect the overall increase in production. If everyone understands the benefits of using new-style farm tools and new technologies and breaks down conservative ideas, the agricultural capital construction and production reform in the cooperative will be easier to carry out.

In addition, for the leading core members of the cooperative, it is also necessary to continuously conduct education on working methods and democratic style, to ensure collective leadership and normal democratic life within the cooperative, and to prevent "patriarchal" and "foreman-style" leadership.

For both male and female members, it is necessary to conduct education to mobilize women to participate in production and participate in the management of cooperative affairs, so that members recognize that women are an important force in agricultural production cooperatives. Only when women participate in production labor and participate in the management of cooperative affairs can the enthusiasm of women be brought into play, so that the entire cooperative can increase production more and each household can increase income more. Women must also be made to realize that only by participating in agricultural production cooperatives and actively engaging in labor and production can they achieve truly equal status and complete liberation.

What methods should be used to carry out political work?

How should ideological education be carried out? The most important thing is to connect with the actual lives and specific thoughts of the members, and inspire them to educate themselves with vivid examples from their own experiences and what they have seen with their own eyes. What we said earlier about from what aspects to carry out ideological education is just to point out some topics for carrying out ideological education. When carrying out ideological education, it is not enough to talk about some big principles; it is not enough to have no topic, and it is still empty if there is a topic but no specific content. Where can specific content be found? It depends on everyone finding living examples locally and in their own cooperatives. Two principles should also be noted when carrying out ideological education: one is to combine it with production activities, and try to find ways to carry out propaganda and mobilization in production activities, so that it can directly promote production and not waste production time; the other is to combine it with solving specific problems. Some ideological problems arise because some specific problems have not been solved, such as if there are indeed unreasonable aspects in the use of the means of production, the assessment of workdays, and the distribution of income, then ideological education alone cannot completely solve the problem.

According to these principles and the practical experience of various places, the following methods can be used to carry out political work in agricultural production cooperatives:

1. Summarize the work of agricultural production cooperatives according to the season and the year, so that members recognize where the superiority of the cooperative is specifically manifested, and consolidate the members' determination to take the socialist road. At the end of each agricultural season and at the end of the year, the important achievements in agricultural production and sideline production can be summarized and compared with the production of the previous year, and also compared with the production of local mutual aid teams and individual households. If there are relatively advanced and relatively backward production teams within the cooperative, they can also be compared, and reported to all members. After the report, organize everyone to discuss the reasons for the achievements. This is easy to do. Some cooperatives have done this, and the members naturally said: "Mutual aid teams are stronger than individual work, and cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid teams." "This road is the right one to take, let's walk it well!"

2. Carry out patriotic production increase competitions and award labor models. Competitions can be held throughout the year or during certain production seasons between several agricultural production cooperatives in a township or village, between cooperatives and mutual aid teams, between small teams within a cooperative, and between members. In the middle of the competition, mutual visits can be organized and regular evaluations can be made. The purpose of competition, evaluation, and awards is to encourage advanced elements, exchange experiences, set examples, and drive all members and the masses outside the cooperative to improve technology, increase production, and take the socialist road.

3. Use living people and living events to carry out praise and criticism, and point out the direction of efforts for all members. In each agricultural production cooperative, there are some people who produce well, some people who produce even better, and there may be some people who do not produce well. This can be used to promote people who produce well to push people who do not produce well, and to call on people who produce well to learn from people who produce even better. For example, after the Wang Zhiqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, changed to "piece-rate contracting" last summer, the Liu Deqi contracting team, in order to earn seven more work points, damaged the eight-cent seedlings. The seedlings were not separated, and the weeds were not hoeed clean. Some people think: It is their own business to earn more work points, and it is everyone's business if the seedlings are damaged. Member Han Xingjia was the opposite, and he cherished the cooperative's property very much. During the wheat harvest, he picked up five ears of wheat that fell on the road and handed them over to the cooperative. The cooperative seized on these two typical examples and organized members to start a discussion. Some members said: "Liu Deqi's approach is called 'losing a watermelon for a sesame seed'." Some said: "Although eight-cent seedlings and five ears of wheat are both small things, the two ideas are different. The former is harmful to the cooperative and also harmful to oneself, and the latter is beneficial to the cooperative and also beneficial to oneself." After discussion, the members further realized that the cooperative belongs to everyone, and everyone must love the cooperative. Liu Deqi also admitted his mistake and said that he would never do anything harmful to the cooperative again. On this ideological basis, the agricultural production cooperative formulated weeding discipline and launched a summer harvest competition to not lose a single grain. In order to regularize this kind of criticism and self-criticism, a system of life review meetings can also be established. Some agricultural production cooperatives stipulate that such meetings should be held every seven days, some stipulate every ten days or half a month, and some, in addition to holding life review meetings, hold team affairs meetings every half a month and a cooperative-wide evaluation meeting every quarter. At these meetings, criticism and self-criticism are carried out, and the labor attitude, the attitude of cherishing public property, the attitude of learning advanced experience, the situation of abiding by labor discipline, and the situation of implementing state laws of each member in daily production are checked. Larger problems can be discussed and conclusions can be made. This will have a greater educational effect on everyone. To hold such meetings well, leading cadres must take the lead in making self-criticisms and listen to everyone's opinions with an open mind. Of course, the self-criticisms of leading cadres should be based on facts, and their mistakes and shortcomings should not be reduced or exaggerated. In addition, individual persuasion and education can be carried out at any time according to the specific situation.

4. Hold classes regularly and systematically explain the general line and the policy on agricultural production cooperatives in a more systematic way. Those who give lectures should pay attention to: First, they should understand the ideological situation of the members in advance, and study and prepare the content of the lectures together with the leading core members of the cooperative; second, they should give more practical examples, especially local examples, when giving lectures; third, they should clarify the central idea of the lesson each time, and not talk about too many clues; fourth, after the lecture, they should lead everyone to discuss and be responsible for answering questions.

In addition, general methods of propaganda and mobilization in rural areas, such as running blackboards, organizing reading groups, rooftop broadcasting, and showing slides, can all be adopted.

Who should lead and carry out political work?

Who should lead the political work of agricultural production cooperatives? Mainly the Communist Party branch.

Rural Communist Party branches, whether established by agricultural production cooperatives or by villages, should take leading agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation as their central work. In leading agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, they should regard ideological education as the most important task. The branch committee should frequently understand the ideological situation of the party members and the general members of the cooperative, and regularly discuss the content and methods of political and ideological education work in the cooperative in each period. In order to do this work well, the branch secretary and branch members should not only closely contact the masses, but also first study the party's general line and the specific policies of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and advanced agricultural production technology. They should also always pay attention to cultivating activists and forming a strong leadership core in the cooperative.

In the branch, propaganda and education work should be strengthened; the ranks of propagandists should be strengthened; at the same time, it must also be pointed out that the entire party must do propaganda work. Every party member should use all opportunities to conduct propaganda and education to the masses anytime and anywhere; more importantly, they should set an example with their own actions and play a model role in production activities and political activities. There are such sentences circulating in the rural areas of Wuxiang, Shanxi: "Villages look at villages, households look at households, and the masses look at the Party branch." Some non-Party masses also said: "Communist Party members walk in front; we do what they do." Farmers are paying attention to every action of party members. Party members must not let down the trust and expectations of the masses, but must resolutely take the road of collectivization, put the interests of the collective first, work hard, abide by discipline, actively respond to the government's call, strive to learn advanced technology, and lead all members and the masses outside the cooperative to move forward together.

    农业生产合作社怎样进行政治工作
    燕凌
    农民加入农业生产合作社是自愿的；可是这决不是说，只要入了社，每个人思想上所有的问题就完全解决了。有的人虽然自愿，却并不是完全自觉的。有的人是“随大流”抱着“试试看”的态度入社的，并不真正认识入社的好处。有的人虽然也认识入社的好处，可是还不了解办社的困难，碰到一些困难就又会动摇。有的人只想到入社对自己好，却不肯为大家共同的利益拿出自己的全部力量来。有些人刚把私有的土地、牲畜、农具交给社里统一使用，总难免有些心神不定，总害怕这是“归大堆”。大家刚从分散的经营改变成集体的经营，总难免有些不习惯。
    成立了农业生产合作社，人和人的关系就要发生变化，社员和社员之间，社员群众和领导骨干之间，关系和入社以前大不相同了，这个变化会带来不少思想问题。农业生产合作社和社外群众，和互助组，和别的合作社，和国家，都要发生密切的关系，这中间也会不断地发生一些思想问题。再说，农业生产合作社不是成立了以后就固定下来的，它要渐渐扩大，还要一步一步提高，生产工具和技术也要不断改进；在扩大、提高和改进的过程中，也必然会不断发生许多新的思想问题。这些思想问题不解决，就不可能把社办好。要解决这些思想问题，就必须做好政治工作。（这里所说的政治工作，主要是指政治思想教育工作，也包括推广农业先进技术的宣传工作和生产中的鼓动工作。）
      做好政治工作，是把农业生产合作社办好的重要保证，也是使社一步步向社会主义前进的重要保证。要使农业生产合作社巩固和发展，增加生产量和增加社员收入固然是最根本、最重要的事情，但同时也必须做好思想教育工作。思想问题不解决，就会妨碍增加生产；生产不能增加，大家的收入自然也就不可能增加。再说，如果思想问题不解决，即使增加了生产、增加了收入，社也还是会巩固不住的；有的人在收入增加以后，生活富裕了，有了余钱了，还会退出社去做投机生意，走资本主义道路。为了把社办好，为了一步一步前进，社里的骨干和全体社员们都应该好好学习政治，学习文化，用先进的思想把自己的头脑武装起来。
      从哪些方面进行政治工作
    社员们的思想问题虽然很多，总起来说，最主要的不外是这样几个问题：一、对社会主义道路还不熟悉，对合作社到底好不好还不“托底”，对旧道路还有些留恋；二、对集体利益、国家利益还不关心，不了解个人利益和全社的利益、全体农民的利益、国家的利益的关系；三、对先进的科学技术还不相信，有保守思想，不愿改变落后的耕作方法。什么锁子要用什么钥匙开；这些思想问题应该怎样来解决呢？
    第一、要不断地进行社会主义的教育（包括关于社会主义和资本主义两条新旧不同道路的教育，关于工农联盟的教育，关于劳动光荣、剥削可耻的教育，关于合作社的优越性的教育等等）。要认识清楚：社会主义就是没有人剥削人的事情，劳动得越好收入越多，大家一同富裕起来；一同富裕决不是按目前的生活“一律削平”，而是用不断增加生产的办法，使穷的变富，富了还要更富。资本主义就是最少数不劳动的人剥削最大多数劳动的人，只有很少的人富裕，大多数人都成为穷人。要走社会主义的道路，要不断增加生产，就要跟着共产党走，就要加强工农联盟，就要巩固和发展合作社。入了社，就是走对了路。顺着这条路一直走下去，就能把日子过得越来越美。可是，走上这条路以后，还得要好好走才行；走这条路，并不是像买票坐火车一样，坐上去不用动弹就能走到社会主义。办了社就有了增加生产、增加收入、向社会主义前进的好条件；可是，如果不好好劳动，不肯一步一步走，不好好利用合作社的好条件，仍然什么都是空的；如果不务正业，经营商业，或者过分提高生产资料的报酬，变成对劳力的剥削，那不但不能增加生产，还会走到资本主义的歪路上去。办社是新事情，大家由分散经营转变成集体经营，缺乏经验，在前进中难免要碰到一些困难；为了将来更美好的社会主义生活，决不要害怕这些困难，不要碰到一点困难就想往后退；只要大家一条心，大伙的力量是能够把困难打倒的。大家真正认识了这些道理，就能把动摇不定的心坚定起来，就能积极地在社里参加劳动；在合作社进一步扩大和一步步提高的时候可能发生的问题，也就比较容易解决了。
    第二、要不断地进行集体主义和爱国主义的教育（包括遵守劳动纪律的教育，爱护公共财物的教育，遵守国家法令、响应国家号召的教育，支援国家工业化的教育，社内中农和贫农、老社员和新社员团结友爱互相帮助的教育，团结社外群众的教育等等）。要认识清楚：“大河没水小渠干”，社里受了任何一点损失，都是社员们每一个人的损失；如果每个人都抱着“分到我名下能有多少”的想法来对待社里公共的事情、公共的财物，每个人的损失就会很多，并不很少。个人生活眼前的小改善，应当服从于将来的大改善；生产增加了，收入增多了，社里的公共财产也要增加，只有社的力量大了，公积金、基本建设多了，生产才能更多增加，生活才能更好。为了把全社的生产搞好，大家要自觉地遵守劳动纪律；劳动纪律并不是为了把人拴住，而是为了大家都积极劳动，密切配合，不误工，不误事。还要认清：全体农民的利益都是一致的；有一个新社员入社，就是壮大了全社的一分力量，应该欢迎，不应该排斥；新社员入社以后，老社员应该很好地和他们团结一致，扩大生产，不要因小失大。社内贫农中农的利益也是一致的，解决
  一切问题要从加强贫农和中农的团结着眼。对于暂时还不愿入社的劳动农民，也应该当作好朋友，心里不要存什么隔阂；只要好好团结他们、帮助他们，他们以后终于也是要成为社员的。还要认清：只有国家富强了，工业发达了，农民的生活才能更幸福、更美满。农民支援国家工业化的最好的方法，就是按照国家的计划生产为国家所需要的各种农产品，并且按国家计划收购的办法卖给国家。农业生产合作社力量比较大，规模比较大，便于得到国家的帮助，便于增加生产，并且便于按国家的计划进行生产，大家应该好好地利用这些好条件。大家明白了这些道理，社内部、社内外、社和国家的关系就可以密切起来，闹个人主义、本位主义的现象就可以渐渐减少。
    第三、要不断地提倡改进农业技术（包括关于新式农具的好处的教育，关于改进耕作技术的必要性的教育等等）。要认识清楚：农业生产合作社要增加生产，采用新式农具和新技术是有决定性的意义的。农业生产合作社应该积极地采用新式农具和新技术，提高劳动生产率。在过去长期分散经营，不容易改进农具和技术，很多人也不相信新式农具和新技术的好处。组织农业生产合作社以后，有了改进农具和技术的好条件，就应该在这方面把合作社的优越性充分地发挥出来；如果还是用老办法生产，不但不容易增加生产，还可能遭到损失。使用新技术，一定要大家思想都通了，才能行动一致，实行得好；有些人思想不通，还用老办法，就不能好好配合，就会影响全社的增产。大家都明白了使用新式农具和新技术的好处，打破了保守思想，社里的农业基本建设和生产改革就便于进行了。
    此外，对于社内的领导骨干，还要不断进行工作方法和民主作风的教育，保证社内的集体领导和正常的民主生活，防止“家长式”、“长工头式”的领导。
    对于男女社员，都要进行发动妇女参加生产、参加社务管理的教育，使社员们都认识妇女在农业生产合作社里是一支重要的力量，妇女参加生产劳动、参加社务管理，把妇女的积极性发挥出来，才能使全社更多增加生产，使各户更多增加收入。还要使妇女们认识：只有参加农业生产合作社，积极劳动生产，才能得到真正平等的地位，才能得到彻底解放。
      用什么方法进行政治工作
    怎样进行思想教育呢？最重要的是要联系社员的实际生活和具体思想，启发社员用自己亲身经历和亲眼看到的生动的事例来教育自己。我们在前边所说的从哪些方面进行思想教育，只不过是指出一些进行思想教育的题目。在进行思想教育的时候，光空谈一些大道理是不行的；没有一定的题目不行，光有了题目，没有具体内容，也还是空的。具体内容从那里找？就要靠大家在当地在本社找活的事例了。进行思想教育，还有两条原则应当注意：一条是要和生产活动结合起来，尽量想办法在生产活动中进行宣传鼓动，这样既能直接推动生产，又可以不误生产时间；一条是要和解决具体问题结合起来，有些思想问题的产生是因为确实有些具体问题没有解决，譬如在生产资料的使用、劳动日的评定、收益的分配如果确实有不合理的地方，光进行思想教育还是不能彻底解决问题的。
    根据这些原则和各地的实际经验，可以采用这样几种办法在农业生产合作社内进行政治工作：
    一、按季节、按年总结农业生产合作社的工作，使社员认识合作社的优越性具体表现在那里，巩固社员们走社会主义道路的决心。可以在每个农事季节末尾和年终，把农业生产、副业生产方面的重要的成就总结一下，并且和去年的生产作个比较，还可以和当地互助组、单干户的生产作个比较，社内各队生产有比较先进的、有比较落后的，也可以作个比较，向全体社员报告。报告以后，组织大家讨论获得成就的原因。这是很容易作到的。有的社这样做了，社员们很自然地说：“互助组就是比单干强，合作社就是比互助组强。”“这条路可走对了，好好走下去吧！”
    二、开展爱国增产评比竞赛，奖励劳动模范。一乡一村之内的几个农业生产合作社之间，社和互助组之间，社内的小队和小队之间，社员和社员之间，都可以进行全年的或者一定生产季节的竞赛。在竞赛中间，可以组织互相参观，定期评比。竞赛、评比、奖励的目的，都是为了鼓励先进，交流经验，树立榜样，带动全体社员和社外群众改进技术、增加生产，走社会主义的道路。
    三、用活人活事进行表扬和批评，给全体社员指出努力的方向。在每个农业生产合作社中，都有一部分人生产得好，一部分人生产得更好，也可能有一部分人生产得不好。这就可以用生产得好的人去推动生产不好的人，号召生产好的人还要向生产得更好的人学习。例如：河北邢台县王志琪农业生产合作社去年夏天改成“按件包工”以后，刘德起包工小组，为了多挣七分工票，把八分小苗锄坏了，苗没有分开，草没有锄净。有人认为：自己多挣点工分是自己的，苗锄坏了是大伙的。社员韩兴甲和他们相反，很爱护社里的财产。在麦收时，他把拉麦子丢在路上的五个麦穗也拾回来交给社里。社里就抓住这两个典型事例，组织社员展开了讨论。有的社员说：“刘德起的作法叫‘为了芝麻丢了西瓜’。”有的说：“八分小苗和五个麦穗，虽然都是小事，可是两种思想就不同了，前一种是害社也害己，后一种是利社也利己。”经过讨论，社员们进一步认识到社是大家的，大家必须爱社。刘德起也承认了自己的错误，表示以后再不干这害社的事了。农业生产合作社，就在这样的思想基础上，订出了锄苗纪律，开展了不丢一粒粮的夏收竞赛。为了把这种批评和自我批评经常化，还可以建立生活检讨会的制度。这样的会，有的农业生产合作社规定七天开一次，有的规定十天或半月开一次，还有的除了召开生活检讨会外，半月召开一次队务会议，一季开一次全社评比会。在这些会上，开展批评和自我批评，检查每个社员在日常生产中的劳动态度，爱护公共财产的态度，学习先进经验的态度，遵守劳动纪律的情形，执行国家法令的情形。较大的问题，讨论后，并且可以作出结论。这样对大家的教育作用会更大。要开好这种会议，领导干部要带头检讨，虚心听取大家的意见。当然领导干部的检讨，应该是实事求是的，既不要缩小，也不要夸大自己的错误和缺点。此外，还可以根据具体情况，随时进行个别的说服教育。
    四、定期上课，按部就班地比较系统地讲解总路线和关于农业生产合作社的政策。讲课的人应当注意：第一，事前要了解社员的思想情况，并和社里的领导骨干一同研究准备讲课的内容；第二，讲课时要多举实际例子，特别是本地方的例子；第三，每次要把课文的中心思想讲清楚，不要讲得头绪太多；第四，讲课后，要领导大家讨论，还要负责解答问题。
    此外，一般农村中进行宣传鼓动的方式，像办黑板报、组织读报组、屋顶广播、放映幻灯等等，都是可以采用的。
      谁来领导和进行政治工作
    谁来领导农业生产合作社的政治工作呢？主要是共产党的支部。
    农村共产党支部，不论是以农业生产合作社为单位建立的，还是以村为单位建立的，都应当把领导农业生产互助合作当作自己的中心工作。在领导农业生产互助合作中，又应当把思想教育工作当做最重要的任务。支部委员会要经常了解社里的党员和一般社员群众的思想情况，定期讨论每个时期社里的政治思想教育工作的内容和方法。为了把这个工作做好，支部书记和支部委员一方面要密切联系群众，一方面自己要先好好学习党的总路线和农业生产互助合作的具体政策以及先进的农业生产技术。还应当经常注意培养积极分子，在社内形成一个坚强的领导核心。
    在支部里，应当加强宣传教育工作；应当加强宣传员的队伍；同时，也必须指出，全党都要做宣传工作。每一个党员，都要随时随地利用一切机会向群众进行宣传教育；更重要的是以自己的行动做榜样，在生产活动、政治活动中起模范作用。山西武乡农村里流传着这样几句话：“村看村，户看户，群众看的是党支部。”还有些非党群众说：“共产党员，走在前边；他们咋办，咱就咋办。”党员的每一个行动，农民都在注意看着。党员同志们千万不要辜负了群众的信任和期望，要坚决走合作化的道路，把集体的利益放在第一位，努力劳动，遵守纪律，积极响应政府号召，努力学习先进技术，带动全体社员和社外群众一起前进。
