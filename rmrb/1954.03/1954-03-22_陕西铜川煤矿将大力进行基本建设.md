    In order to fully supply the growing demand for coal from industries such as electricity, textiles, and machinery manufacturing in the Xi'an and Xianyang areas, the Shaanxi Tongchuan Coal Mine, one of the major state-owned coal mines in the Northwest region, will build a new pair of mine shafts and renovate two pairs of mine shafts this year. After the construction and renovation of these mine shafts is completed, the coal production of the Tongchuan Coal Mine will increase to more than six times the production volume of 1953. In order to rapidly increase coal production, the Northwest Coal Mine Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government will also continue to conduct drilling in the 58-square-kilometer area surrounding the Tongchuan mining area, so as to build new mine shafts in the future.
    The pair of mine shafts to be newly built by the Tongchuan Coal Mine this year is currently the largest modern mine shaft in the Northwest region. The main production process of this mine shaft, from underground coal mining to ground transportation, will use machinery instead of manual labor. After the completion of this pair of new mine shafts, its annual production capacity will be 50% greater than the current annual output of the entire mine. The two pairs of mine shafts to be renovated will also have mechanical equipment. At present, the Tongchuan Coal Mine is stepping up various preparations before construction. Various construction machines such as steam-powered rock grabbers, air compressors, wind drills, and lifting pumps, as well as a large number of wood and steel cables, have been transported to the construction site one after another. The renovated Tongchuan Thermal Power Plant has also officially supplied power recently. In order to enable workers to master the technology of mechanized coal mining, the Tongchuan Coal Mine has transferred a group of workers and cadres to coal mines in Northeast China, Huainan and other places for study. Another group of workers is now using their spare time to study basic knowledge of electricity and machinery.

    陕西铜川煤矿将大力进行基本建设
    为了充分供应西安、咸阳地区日益增长的电力、纺织、机械制造等工业用煤需要，西北区主要的国营煤矿之一——陕西铜川煤矿今年将新建一对矿井和改建两对矿井，这些矿井新建、改建完成后，铜川煤矿的产煤量将增加到一九五三年产量的六倍以上。中央人民政府燃料工业部西北煤矿管理局为迅速提高煤产量，还将继续在铜川矿区周围五十八平方公里地区内进行钻探，以便将来再建设新的矿井。
    铜川煤矿今年准备新建的一对矿井，是目前西北区规模最大的一个现代化矿井，这个矿井从井下采煤到地面运输的主要生产过程将采用机械来代替。这对新矿井建成后，它的年产能力要比目前全矿的年产量还多百分之五十。改建的两对矿井，也将有机械设备。现在，铜川煤矿正加紧进行施工前的各项准备工作。汽力抓岩机、空气压缩机、风钻、吊泵等各种施工用的机器和大批的木材、钢丝绳等都已陆续运到工地。修建后的铜川火力发电厂也在最近正式供电。为使工人掌握机械化采煤的技术，铜川煤矿已抽调一部分工人和干部到东北、淮南等地煤矿去学习，另有一部分工人，现在利用业余时间进行电气、机械等基本知识的学习。
