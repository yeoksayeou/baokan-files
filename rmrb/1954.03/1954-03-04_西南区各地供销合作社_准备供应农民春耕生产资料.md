The supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest region are seizing the opportunity to actively prepare to supply spring ploughing production materials.

As early as last winter, under the direct leadership of the CCP committees at all levels, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the Southwest region successively held various business meetings to study the preparatory work for supplying farmers with spring ploughing production materials, and formulated supply plans. Due to the fact that in the process of studying the general line, cooperative cadres in various places examined and criticized the capitalist business ideas and practices that existed in the supply work in the past, their work enthusiasm was improved, and they actively organized sources of goods to meet the needs of farmers to expand production. After the Tongren Special District Office of the Guizhou Provincial Cooperative Union formulated a supply plan for production materials in the fourth quarter of last year, it has purchased millions of catties of tung seeds and is now extracting a large amount of tung oil to obtain tung cake. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the entire special district have mastered hundreds of thousands of catties of pig iron and old iron, and have processed a large number of iron, bamboo and wooden farm tools. By the end of January this year, according to incomplete statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives in twelve counties and cities in Nanchong Special District, Sichuan Province, the prepared production materials such as farm tools, seeds, bone meal, sprayers, and chemical fertilizers increased by 74.2 percent compared with the same period in 1953. Many supply and marketing cooperatives have also increased the variety of operations.

In order to avoid the blindness of the past in supply work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have strengthened investigation and research work when organizing sources of goods. Supply and marketing cooperatives in many counties in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces have specially organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations in townships and villages, focusing on the quantity and specifications of production materials required by one village, one agricultural production cooperative, one mutual aid group, or one farmer household, and then held meetings of directors and supervisors to conduct research and formulate supply plans. And according to the different needs of farmers in different regions, they purposefully organize sources of goods.

In the process of organizing sources of goods, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places generally strengthened the organization and leadership of handicraftsmen. Under the leadership of the local party and government organs, supply and marketing cooperatives in Mianyang, Changshou, Yingshan and other places in Sichuan Province also specially held representative meetings or symposiums of handicraftsmen to conduct socialist education for handicraftsmen and sign processing and ordering contracts. After signing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, many handicraftsmen eliminated their concerns about the backlog of products and actively produced with confidence and boldness.

Some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have strengthened the connection between districts and counties and done a good job in the adjustment between regions in the preparation of spring ploughing production materials. At the joint meeting of directors and business managers of six primary cooperatives in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, more than 27,000 pieces of various farm tools were mutually adjusted. Recently, the county cooperative union also sent cadres to strengthen contacts with cooperative societies in Xinping, Eshan and other counties to solve the problem of insufficient supply of farm tools in the county. Supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas of Sichuan Province held internal material exchange meetings. Before holding an internal material exchange meeting, the Mianyang County Federation of Cooperatives notified the supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts to conduct investigations and research on the production and sales of agricultural production materials in their districts, and then adjusted the existing materials within the district at the exchange meeting of the County Federation of Cooperatives, and also exchanged the materials that can be produced in various districts, which further increased the content of the internal material exchange meeting.

However, there are still some problems in the work of preparing for the supply of spring ploughing production materials in some supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, the persons in charge of the cooperative unions in a few counties do not pay enough attention to the work of supplying production materials, and even think that "farmers will find their own way," so they do not actively organize sources of goods. Some primary supply and marketing cooperatives emphasize objective difficulties, do not actively try to improve their work, and have a mentality of simply relying on higher-level cooperatives. Secondly, some cooperative cadres underestimate the material needs of farmers to expand production, are blindly optimistic, and therefore no longer carry out the necessary preparatory work. In addition, many supply and marketing cooperatives only pay attention to the supply of farm tools, but neglect the preparation of fertilizers and seeds. They think that "anyway, fertilizers are lacking," so they simply do not try to find sources of goods. These shortcomings should be corrected immediately.

    西南区各地供销合作社
    准备供应农民春耕生产资料
    西南区各地供销合作社正抓紧时机，积极准备供应春耕生产资料。
    早在去年冬季，西南各地供销合作社在中共各级党委的直接领导下，就先后召开了各种业务会议，研究了供应农民春耕生产资料的准备工作，并制订了供应计划。各地合作社干部由于在学习总路线过程中，检查批判了已往在供应工作中存在着的资本主义经营思想和作法，工作热情提高，积极组织货源，满足农民扩大生产的需要。贵州省合作社联合社铜仁专区办事处，于去年第四季度制订出生产资料的供应计划后，已收购桐子数百万斤，现正大量榨油取桐枯；全专区供销合作社掌握了数十万斤毛铁和旧铁，已加工了大量的铁制、竹制和木制农具。四川省南充专区到今年一月底，据十二个县、市的供销合作社的不完全统计，已准备好的农具、种籽、骨粉、喷雾器、化学肥料等生产资料，较一九五三年同一时期增加百分之七十四点二。很多供销合作社还增加经营品种。
    各地供销合作社为避免已往在供应工作中的盲目性，组织货源时大都加强了调查研究工作。四川、贵州两省不少县的供销合作社曾专门组织力量深入乡、村重点调查一个村、一个农业生产合作社、一个互助组或一户农民需要生产资料的数量和规格，然后召开理、监事会议进行研究，制订供应计划。并按照不同地区的农民的不同需要，有目的地组织货源。
    各地供销合作社在组织货源中，一般都加强了对手工业者的组织领导。四川省绵阳、长寿、营山等地供销合作社在当地党政机关领导下，还专门召开了手工业者代表会或座谈会，对手工业者进行社会主义教育，签订加工、订货合同。很多手工业者经与供销合作社签订合同后，消除了怕产品积压的顾虑，放心大胆地积极生产。
    有些地区的供销合作社，在准备春耕生产资料工作中，加强了区与区、县与县的联系，做好地区之间的调剂工作。云南省玉溪县有六个基层社在理事主任及负责业务的干部联席会上，互相调剂了各种农具两万七千多件；最近该县合作社联合社还派出干部加强与新平、峨山等县合作社的联系，以解决本县农具供应不足的困难。四川省有些地区的供销合作社召开了内部物资交流会。绵阳县联社在召开内部物资交流会前，通知各区供销合作社对本区农业生产资料的产销情况作了调查研究，然后在县联社的交流会上调剂了内部现有物资，还交换了各区可以生产的物资，更增加了内部物资交流会的内容。
    但是，有些供销合作社在准备供应春耕生产资料的工作中还存在一些问题。如少数县的合作社联合社的负责人，对供应生产资料的工作没有足够重视，甚至认为“农民自己会想办法”，便不积极组织货源。有些基层供销合作社强调客观困难，不主动设法改进工作，存有单纯依靠上级社的情绪。其次，有的合作社干部对农民扩大生产的物资需要估计不足，盲目乐观，因而不再进行必要的准备工作。还有，不少供销合作社只重视了供应农具，却忽视了准备肥料、种籽，他们认为“反正肥料缺乏”，竟干脆不设法寻找货源。这些缺点均应立即纠正。
