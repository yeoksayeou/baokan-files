The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau convened the North China Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference from February 13th to 25th. Participants included the Minister of the CCP Inner Mongolia Branch and the Rural Work Departments of various provincial committees, secretaries of the Rural Work Committees of various municipal committees, secretaries of local and some county committees, and personnel from relevant organizations and groups at the North China level, totaling over 300 people.

The conference analyzed the current development situation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the North China region, believing that the overall development of the movement was good and healthy. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line, the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants in the North China region was high, and they actively demanded to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Mutual aid teams have greatly developed, and agricultural production cooperatives have also exceeded the original development plan. On average, organized farmers account for more than 50% of the total number of farmers; advanced areas account for 70% to 80%. Farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives account for about 5% of the total number of farmers in the region.

The conference believed that there were still some problems in the movement in a few areas: some leading cadres overestimated the enthusiasm of the peasants and mistook the demands of some activists for the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants; in some areas where the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation was not good, the movement also developed suddenly with rough work; and in individual areas, there were some phenomena of coercion and commandism due to the simple pursuit of quantity.

In view of this, the conference emphasized that turning around some unhealthy phenomena in development and shifting the leadership's focus to consolidation is the central task in the current development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The conference required all regions to strengthen the consolidation of new and old cooperatives. For newly established cooperatives, a thorough inspection and review should be conducted in conjunction with production activities based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit to help solve existing problems within the cooperatives, so that they can quickly transition to spring plowing production. In conjunction with production activities, necessary and feasible systems should be established within the cooperatives to carry out the "four evaluations" of labor, land, livestock, and farm implements, formulate annual and seasonal production plans with planting plans as the main focus, and establish production management, labor organization, and financial management systems. In addition, all regions should systematically train key personnel, coupled with necessary and possible economic support from the state, to help newly established cooperatives solve production difficulties. At the same time, close attention should be paid to solving certain ideological concerns of new members, strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership within the cooperatives, and continuously improving the socialist enthusiasm and production increase enthusiasm of the members, ensuring increased grain and cotton production, thereby ensuring the consolidation of newly established cooperatives. For old cooperatives, attention must be paid to the various problems that exist currently with the development of production and the expansion of the cooperatives, such as the different demands of middle peasants and poor peasants for the distribution of land and labor benefits, the inconsistent interests of new and old members in certain aspects, and the inconsistent opinions of members on the accumulation of public funds and the demand for more individual distribution. The solution of these problems has become a decisive factor in whether old cooperatives can advance and improve. The conference put forward the principle opinions for solving these problems: at present, it is not appropriate for the proportion of land and labor distribution to be too high or too low; however, on the basis of increased land yield in the cooperatives, increased income of members, and improved ideological awareness, land distribution should be gradually reduced, labor remuneration should be increased, and the accumulation of public property should be gradually expanded; at the same time, the operation and management within the cooperatives should be strengthened. Only in this way can the existing problems in agricultural production cooperatives be solved and gradually improved. The conference pointed out that it is wrong to rush to improve the organizational form of agricultural production cooperatives without considering the specific conditions and the level of awareness of the members. The contradictions in the interests of new and old members should mainly rely on carrying out political education to improve their awareness and unify them in a way that they can accept.

The conference emphasized that although agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have achieved great development this year, it must be seen that the number of farmers joining the cooperatives only accounts for about 5% of the total number of farmers; while mutual aid teams and individual farmers still account for more than 90%. At present, the main focus of increasing grain production, especially the large-scale production of marketable grain, still lies with them. At present, to greatly increase grain production, especially to increase marketable grain production, the leadership must pay attention to strengthening the leadership of mutual aid teams and giving play to the potential of individual farmers in increasing grain and cotton production. Vigorously developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and combining mutual aid and cooperation with the patriotic production increase movement is still very important. After criticizing the idea of some cadres who underestimate mutual aid teams, the conference put forward methods for consolidating and developing mutual aid teams, pointing out that various regions should promote existing experience, use forms such as mutual aid and cooperation networks to drive mutual aid teams with agricultural production cooperatives, and often study and solve internal problems of mutual aid teams to consolidate and improve them; at the same time, strengthen the leadership of individual farmers, and educate and attract them to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation with the superiority of organization. In terms of state loans and supply of fertilizers, appropriate consideration should be given to mutual aid teams and individual farmers. It is wrong to underestimate mutual aid teams and discriminate against individual farmers.

The conference also studied the production and mutual aid and cooperation in urban suburbs, pointing out that suburbs should focus on vegetable production and, where possible, appropriately increase the production of fruits, milk, and meat to meet the needs of urban people. At the same time, based on the special conditions of urban suburbs, such as relatively developed economy and culture and flat land, agricultural production cooperatives can also be directly established on the basis of mass voluntariness; and because labor, technology, and investment in vegetable production are different from general agricultural production in various aspects, the proportion of labor distribution in suburban agricultural production cooperatives should also be greater than that of general cooperatives.

Finally, the conference emphasized that rural workers should have a comprehensive view and have a correct understanding of the relationship between the main body and the two wings of the general line, industry and agriculture, workers and peasants, and cities and villages. They cannot only bury themselves in agriculture and isolate rural work and agricultural socialist transformation. The conference pointed out that the essence of the worker-peasant alliance is that the working class leads the peasants to socialism; the country's socialist industrialization is the most fundamental and long-term interest of the peasants. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out education among the peasants on agricultural production supporting industrial construction, explaining that at present, industrial production can only help agricultural production where possible, and only when the country is socialist industrialized can industrial production vigorously help agricultural production and rapidly change the face of the countryside. Rural cadres must understand the path and methods of agricultural socialist transformation, and the secretaries of Party committees at all levels in rural work must personally take action to earnestly implement the "relying on the solid alliance of poor and middle peasants, gradually developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants" pointed out in the CCP Central Committee's decision on developing agricultural production cooperatives. This systematic policy strengthens the Party's leadership and closely combines the Party's political work and economic work to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    中共中央华北局召开农业互助合作会议
    要求各地巩固农业生产合作社
    中共中央华北局于二月十三日到二十五日召开了华北农业生产互助合作会议。参加会议的有中共内蒙古分局和各省委农村工作部部长，各市委农村工作委员会书记，各地委和部分县委书记，以及华北级各有关机关团体人员共三百多人。
    会议对华北区当前互助合作运动发展的形势作了分析，认为全区运动的发展情况基本上是良好的、健康的。在总路线光辉的照耀下，华北区农民的社会主义热情高涨，积极要求参加互助合作组织，互助组有很大发展，农业生产合作社也已超过原定的发展计划。组织起来的农户平均占总农户百分之五十以上；先进地区占到百分之七十到八十。参加农业生产合作社的农户占到全区总农户的百分之五左右。
    会议认为少数地区运动中还存在一些问题：有些领导干部过高估计了农民的热情，把一部分积极分子的要求误认为广大农民的热情；有些互助合作基础并不好的地区，运动也突然大发展，工作粗糙；还有个别地区因单纯追求数量，出现某些强迫命令现象。
    据此，会议着重指出：将发展中的某些不健康现象扭转过来，把领导力量转到巩固方面来，是当前互助合作运动发展中的中心任务。
    会议要求各地加强对新社和老社的巩固工作。对新建社，应根据自愿互利原则，结合生产活动普遍进行一次深入的检查和审查，帮助解决社内存在的问题，使其迅速转入春耕生产。并结合生产活动，在社内建立必要可行的制度，进行劳力、土地、牲畜、农具的“四评”工作，制订以种植计划为主的全年的和季节的生产计划，建立生产管理，劳动组织和财务管理等制度。此外，各地要有计划地训练骨干，加上国家必要可能的经济支援，帮助新建社解决生产上的困难。同时，要十分注意解决新入社社员思想上的某些顾虑，加强党在社内的政治思想领导，不断提高社员社会主义的热情和增产热情，保证粮棉增产，从而保证新建社的巩固。对老社，必须注意到它们随着生产的发展和社的扩大，在当前存在的各种问题，如中农和贫农对土地、劳动分益要求不同的问题，新社员和老社员在某些利益方面不一致的问题，社员对公积金积累和要求个人多分的不一致的问题。这些问题的解决，成为老社能否前进和提高的决定因素。会议提出了解决这些问题的原则意见：在目前土地和劳力分益的比例偏高或偏低都不妥当；但在社内土地产量增加、社员收入也有增加和思想觉悟提高的基础上应逐步降低土地分益，提高劳动报酬，逐渐扩大公共财产的积累；同时要加强社内的经营管理。这样才能解决农业生产合作社内现存的问题，并使之逐步提高。会议指出：不看具体条件和社员的觉悟程度，急于提高农业生产合作社的组织形式是错误的。对新社员和老社员利益上的矛盾，应主要依靠进行政治教育提高其觉悟，并以他们能够接受的办法，使其一致起来。
    会议强调指出：今年各地农业生产合作社虽获得很大发展，但还必须看到入社农户才占总农户百分之五左右；而互助组和个体农民仍占百分之九十以上，目前粮食增产特别是商品粮的大量生产，主要的还是他们。当前要大量增产粮食，特别是增产商品粮食，领导力量还必须注意加强对互助组的领导和发挥个体农户在增产粮棉中的潜在能力。大力发展互助合作运动，把互助合作和爱国增产运动结合起来，仍然是十分重要的。会议批判了某些干部轻视互助组的思想之后，提出了巩固和发展互助组的办法，指出各地应推广已有的经验，用互助合作网等形式，以农业生产合作社带动互助组，并经常研究解决互助组内部的问题，使其巩固和提高；同时加强对个体农民的领导，以组织起来的优越性去教育和吸引他们走互助合作的道路。在国家贷款和供应肥料方面，都应给互助组和个体农民以适当照顾。轻视互助组和歧视单干农民的作法是错误的。
    会议还研究了城市郊区的生产和互助合作的问题，指出郊区应以蔬菜生产为中心，并在可能条件下适当增产水果、乳类和肉类，供应城市人民需要。同时根据城市郊区的经济文化比较发展和土地平坦等特殊条件，在群众自愿的基础上，也可直接建立农业生产合作社；又因蔬菜生产中的劳动、技术和投资各方面与一般农业生产有所不同，郊区农业生产合作社劳动分益的比例，也应大于一般社的劳动分益。
    最后，会议着重指出：农村工作者要有全面观点，对总路线的主体和两翼、工业和农业、工人和农民、城市和乡村各方面的关系，要有正确的理解。不能只埋头于农业，把农村工作和农业社会主义改造孤立起来。会议指出：工农联盟的实质，就是工人阶级领导农民走向社会主义；国家的社会主义工业化，就是农民最根本最长远的利益。因此，在农民中必须进行农业生产支援工业建设的教育，说明在目前工业生产还只能在可能的情况下帮助农业生产，只有国家社会主义工业化了，工业生产才能大力帮助农业生产，迅速改变农村的面貌。农村干部必须懂得农业社会主义改造的道路和方法，农村工作的各级党委书记要亲自动手，认真贯彻中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中所指出的“依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削。”这一系统的政策，加强党的领导，把党的政治工作和经济工作密切结合起来，逐步实现农业的社会主义改造。
