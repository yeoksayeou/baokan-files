Lantern Slides: A Powerful Tool for Cultural, Educational, and Scientific Popularization
    Ye Fu
    China's lantern slide industry was not very developed in the past, and few people paid attention to it within the scope of cultural and educational undertakings. After liberation, the People's Government listed it as a major item in cultural, educational, and scientific popularization work, and promoted and popularized it in a planned way. From the central government to the cultural and educational departments of major administrative regions, there are specialized institutions and personnel responsible for this work, and science popularization associations in various regions also attach great importance to this work. Some regions have also held training courses for lantern slide workers, organized lantern slide projection teams, and established lantern slide or lantern slide projector production institutions. From 1949 to 1953, in just four years, 19 state-owned lantern slide and lantern slide projector factories were established nationwide, and some private merchants also voluntarily formed 45 private lantern slide companies. In order to better develop this undertaking and facilitate strengthened management nationwide, in 1952, the Ministry of Culture also established the "China Lantern Slide Company," and attached a lantern slide and projector manufacturing plant to the company. The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, and other central ministries have also established working institutions for compiling lantern slides, and regularly compile and draw lantern slides related to their unit's business. In these four years, approximately 40,000 lantern slide projectors and more than 600,000 sets of lantern slides were distributed nationwide. If each set is projected an average of five times, with an average audience of 100 people each time, at least 300 million people have received lantern slide education in four years.
    Among these lantern slides, the ones with the largest distribution and most welcomed by the masses are "The Road to Happiness," "Aunt Wang Attends the Fair," "When the Grapes are Ripe," "The New Look of the Chinese Countryside," "The Child Bride's Emancipation," "Qiu Guanxing Becomes Deputy County Chief," "Young Guards," "Chairman Mao's Little Heroes," "New Child-Rearing Methods," and so on. After these lantern slides were projected in rural areas, towns, and front-line troops, they greatly inspired the patriotic and production enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, encouraged the fighting courage of the soldiers, resolved many family disputes, and improved the scientific knowledge of the masses. From around the Spring Festival of 1954, the China Lantern Slide Company and lantern slide institutions in various regions have drawn many lantern slides related to the general line propaganda to conduct socialist education among the broad masses. Among the products of the China Lantern Slide Company, there are twelve types of lantern slides promoting national industrialization, agricultural cooperation, and introducing Soviet construction, among which "Anshan Iron and Steel," "Spark Collective Farm," "How the Soviet Union Implemented Industrialization," and "A Siberian Collective Farm" have larger sales. In addition, the China Lantern Slide Company and lantern slide institutions in various provinces and cities have also compiled and printed many lantern slides to cooperate with the general election work.
    The reason why the lantern slide business has developed so rapidly is not only due to the government's vigorous promotion and popularization, but also mainly due to the general improvement of the masses'—especially the peasants'—lives, and their urgent need for cultural entertainment. At present, lantern slides are more suitable for their appreciation level and needs. They call lantern slides "earth movies." Like movies, lantern slides can be watched collectively, and there are also people to explain them. The projection time can be freely controlled by the projection personnel, allowing the audience to understand slowly. When Chairman Mao appears, it is entirely possible to stay for a few more minutes at the audience's request. When lantern slides are projected in a village, even old women often come from several miles away to watch. Sometimes when lantern slides are projected in the square, it suddenly rains heavily, but the audience often refuses to leave and continues to watch with their clothes over their heads. Rural cadres often say to lantern slide projectionists: "One time you project lantern slides is better than we hold ten meetings."
    According to some incomplete investigation materials, the lantern slide work in Shaoxing and Shengxian in Zhejiang, Jieyang in Guangdong, Pinghe in Fujian, Lushan in Henan, Tongxian in Hebei, Xiyang in Shanxi, and Longjiang in Northeast China has been relatively successful. For example, Shaoxing County has more than 200 lantern slide projectors, and they are often used, becoming an indispensable program for farmers' gatherings and a major propaganda tool for promoting movements and arranging production tasks. The Shaoxing County Bureau of Culture and Education and the County Cultural Center have mastered this powerful propaganda tool, organizing primary school art teachers and folk artists to compile or copy various lantern slides in combination with the propaganda tasks at the time and place. Hundreds of farmer projectionists and commentators have been trained to undertake lantern slide propaganda work. During the patriotic donation movement, Dongguan District of the county inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses through lantern slide propaganda and overfulfilled the glorious task of "Dongguan" fighter plane.
    However, precisely because this undertaking has developed so rapidly, there are inevitably shortcomings in the work. Here are a few suggestions for comrades engaged in lantern slide work to consider:
    (1) Although there are many lantern slide factories at present, they are all small in scale, and there are too many institutions, the organization is unsound, and the work pace is inconsistent. There is no reasonable division of labor, and the themes and contents of the lantern slides drawn are often the same, resulting in many unnecessary repetitions and waste. We know that there are only two lantern slide factories in the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union's lantern slide business is very developed. Almost every collective farm, factory, mine, school, group, and even most families, have lantern slide projector equipment, and lantern slides can be bought in shops that sell cigarettes and at the entrances of parks. The Soviet people not only regard lantern slides as a form of cultural entertainment and propaganda education, but also widely use them as a tool for school education and scientific research. It can be seen from this that the number of lantern slide factories we have at present is not small, but with many institutions, manpower and material resources are bound to be dispersed. It is very necessary to make a reasonable adjustment according to the current specific situation; at the same time, strengthen the management of private lantern slide companies, clarify the division of labor, streamline institutions, adjust public-private relations, so as to improve the quality of lantern slides and better exert their propaganda and educational effectiveness.
    (2) Some people say: "Lantern slides are only a temporary substitute for movies. When movies become popular, no one will want to watch lantern slides." Some lantern slide workers also have this view. This view is wrong. Because everyone knows that the Soviet Union's film industry is very developed, but the lantern slide business is also very developed. This fully shows that lantern slides cannot be completely replaced by movies. Of course, when movies become popular in rural areas, the peasants' cultural level will gradually improve, and they will also become accustomed to appreciating movies. But at that time, we will be like the Soviet Union today, and the scope of use of lantern slides will also be broader. The lantern slide business will not decline due to the popularity of movies; on the contrary, it will develop along with the development of cultural construction. Therefore, how to improve the lantern slide workers' understanding of this work, and how to improve the lantern slide workers' political and ideological level and professional level, is one of the most urgent tasks for the leading comrades of the lantern slide work. It is hoped that leadership will be strengthened in this regard.
    (3) The content of lantern slides is the central issue of the entire lantern slide business. How deep the educational effect and the power of infection on the masses depend entirely on the ideological and artistic nature of the content of the lantern slides. Otherwise, all other operations management, production, sales and other work will be in vain. Among the more than 400 kinds of lantern slides compiled and drawn in the past four years, many are of low level, the characters depicted in the pictures are not vivid and prominent enough, and the scope of the themes is not broad enough. It seems that everyone is writing articles under the same topic, all the same. The explanatory text is also not popular and moving enough. Some of them are simply unintelligible to the peasant masses, thus reducing the power of propaganda and mobilization. In order to overcome these shortcomings, first of all, the compilers and painters are required to work hard to improve their ideological and artistic level. In addition to extracting ready-made materials from newspapers and magazines, compilers also need to vigorously organize external contributions and adopt fresh themes different from general current affairs reports from all aspects, and compile some revolutionary stories that reflect the people's life struggle, introduce the new things of the great motherland, and the revolutionary deeds of heroes of various periods and are suitable for children. At the same time, attention must also be paid to the diversity of styles, and strive to avoid formalism and conceptualization. The authors of the paintings must always pay attention to the technical training and theoretical study in their own artistic practice, combine the needs of creation, and often go to the masses to experience life and enrich the source of creation. It is necessary to appropriately organize and select ready-made external drafts, and in terms of explanatory words, we should study the vividness of the language more, learn the vocabulary of the masses, or compile the explanatory words into lyrics such as "clappers," "mountain songs," and "lotus falls," and strive to be lively, popular and easy to understand.
    (4) We should reproduce more lantern slides from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries that are suitable for the current needs of our people, introduce the advanced experience and scientific knowledge of fraternal countries in production and construction, and appropriately improve the imbalance between the supply of lantern slide products sometimes falling short of demand and sometimes products being overstocked. In terms of production and sales, state-owned production institutions did not pay much attention to sales work in the past, thinking that "we are state-owned institutions and do not need to rely on advertising and publicity, and people will naturally come to us." As a result, the supply of lantern slides was not timely. The lantern slides that projection units urgently need often cannot be bought, while outdated lantern slides are overstocked in the factory and cannot be sold. While adjusting the institutions, we should also strengthen enterprise management, improve production efficiency and product quality, and improve distribution technology, so that products can be delivered to the masses in a timely manner.
    The lantern slide business has a bright and splendid development prospect. It already has a certain foundation. We must continue to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings in our work so that this emerging business can gradually move forward!

    幻灯——文教科学普及工作的利器
    野　夫
    我国幻灯事业，过去不很发达，在文化教育事业的范围里，很少有人注意。解放后，人民政府才把它列为文教科学普及工作中的主要一项，有计划地加以提倡和推广。从中央到各大行政区的文教部门，都有专门机构和专责人员从事这方面的工作，各地区的科学普及协会也很重视这项工作。有的地区还举办幻灯工作人员讲习班，组织幻灯放映队，设立幻灯片或幻灯机的生产机构。从一九四九至一九五三这短短的四年当中，全国就成立了国营的幻灯片和幻灯机制造厂十九个，有些私商也自动组成了私营幻灯社四十五家。为了使这个事业能更好地发展，和便于在全国范围内加强管理，一九五二年，中央文化部还设立了“中国幻灯公司”，并在该公司内附设幻灯片、机制造厂。中央卫生部、农业部等，也都成立了编制幻灯片的工作机构，经常编绘结合本单位业务的幻灯片。在这四年中，全国发行的幻灯机约四万多架，幻灯片约六十多万套。如果每套平均放映五次，每次观众平均一百人，四年中受到幻灯教育的群众，至少在三万万人以上。
    这些幻灯片中发行数最多、最受群众欢迎的有“走向幸福的道路”、“王大娘赶会”、“葡萄熟了的时候”、“中国农村新面貌”、“童养媳翻身”、“邱关兴当了副县长”、“少年近卫队”、“毛主席的小英雄”、“新育儿法”等等。这些幻灯片在农村、市镇及前后方部队里放映后，都大大启发了工农群众爱国增产的劳动热情，鼓舞了战士们的战斗勇气，解决了不少家庭间的纠纷和提高了群众的科学知识。从一九五四年春节前后起，中国幻灯公司和各地幻灯机构更绘制许多有关总路线宣传的灯片，向广大群众进行社会主义教育。在中国幻灯公司出品中，宣传国家工业化、农业合作化与介绍苏联建设的幻灯片有十二种，其中“鞍钢”、“星火集体农场”、“苏联怎样实行工业化”、“一个西伯利亚的集体农场”等销路较大。此外，中国幻灯公司及各省市的幻灯机构，还编印了不少配合普选工作的幻灯片。
    幻灯事业所以发展得这样迅速，除了由于政府大力提倡和推广以外，更主要的是由于群众—特别是农民生活的普遍提高，和他们对于文化娱乐的迫切需要。目前，幻灯是比较适合他们的欣赏水平和需要的。他们称幻灯为“土电影”。幻灯也像电影一样，可以集体观赏，而且还有人讲解。放映的时间可以由放映人员自由控制，能够让观众慢慢的理解。当毛主席出场的时候，观众要求多逗留几分钟，也完全可以办得到。当幻灯在一个村庄里放映的时候，常常连老太婆都从好几里以外赶来观看。有时在广场上放映幻灯，中途忽然下起大雨来，观众往往不肯散场，把衣服顶在头上继续看下去。农村干部常常对幻灯放映员说：“你们放一次幻灯，胜过我们开十次会。”
    根据一些不完全的调查材料来看，浙江的绍兴、嵊县，广东的揭阳，福建的平和，河南的鲁山，河北的通县，山西的昔阳，东北的龙江等地区的幻灯工作，都是比较有成绩的。例如绍兴一县就有二百多架幻灯机，而且经常使用，成为农民集会不可缺少的节目，成为推动运动、布置生产任务的主要宣传工具。绍兴县文教科及县文化馆，掌握了这有力的宣传工具，组织小学美术教师和民间艺人，结合当时当地的宣传任务，编绘或复制各种幻灯片。培养了数百名农民放映员和讲解员，担负幻灯宣传工作。在爱国捐献运动中，该县东关区通过幻灯宣传，鼓舞了群众的爱国热情，曾超额完成了
  “东关号”战斗机一架的光荣任务。
    可是正因为这事业发展得很快，工作中难免有缺点。这里提出几点意见，给从事幻灯工作的同志们参考：
    （一）目前幻灯工厂虽有不少，但都规模不大，而且机构太多，组织不健全，工作步调不一致，没有做到合理的分工，绘制的幻灯片题材内容往往雷同，造成了许多不必要的重复与浪费。我们知道，苏联全国只有两个幻灯工厂，但是苏联的幻灯事业却是非常发达的，差不多每一个农庄、工厂、矿山、学校、团体、甚至大多数的家庭里，都有幻灯机的设备，凡是能买得到烟卷的店铺和公园门口，都可以买到幻灯片。苏联人民不仅把幻灯作为文化娱乐和宣传教育的一种形式，同时也普遍采用为学校教育和科学研究工作上的一种工具。由此可见，我们目前的幻灯工厂，在数量上是不算少的，但机构一多，人力物力势必分散，很需要按目前具体情况，作一次合理的调整；同时加强对私营幻灯社的管理，并明确分工，精简机构，调整公私关系，以提高幻灯片的质量，更好地发挥它的宣传教育的效能。
    （二）有人说：“幻灯仅是暂时代替电影的东西，等到电影普及以后，幻灯便没有人要看了。”有些幻灯工作者也有这样的看法。这种看法是错误的。因为大家知道，苏联的电影事业是很发达的，但是幻灯事业也同样很发达。充分说明了幻灯并不能完全为电影所代替。当然，当电影普及到农村以后，农民们的文化水平逐步提高了，对电影的欣赏也习惯了。但到那时候，我们将像今天的苏联一样，幻灯使用的范围也会更加广阔。幻灯事业不但不会因电影的普及而衰退，相反，它将会跟着文化建设的发展而发展。因此，如何提高幻灯工作人员对于这一工作的认识，如何提高幻灯工作人员的政治思想水平和业务水平，是幻灯工作领导同志当前最迫切的任务之一。希望在这方面加强领导。
    （三）幻灯片的内容问题，是整个幻灯事业的中心问题，它对群众所起的教育作用和感染力深度如何，完全依靠幻灯片内容的思想性和艺术性。否则，其他经营管理、生产、推销等一切工作都会落空。过去四年来编绘的四百多种幻灯片，其中有不少水平很低，画面所表现的人物形象不够生动突出，题材的范围也不够广阔，好像大家在同一个题目底下作文章，千篇一律。说明文字，也不够通俗动人，有的，农民群众简直没法听懂，因此也就减少了宣传鼓动的力量。为克服这些缺点，首先要求编绘工作者努力提高思想与艺术水平。编撰者，除了从报章杂志上撷取现成的材料以外，更需大力组织外稿，并向各方面采取不同于一般时事报道的新鲜题材，有计划地编撰些反映人民生活斗争、介绍伟大祖国的新事物和各个时期英雄人物的革命事迹和适合于少年儿童的故事。同时还须注意体裁的多样性，极力避免公式化和概念化。绘画的作者，在自己的艺术实践中，必须经常注意技术的锻炼与理论的钻研，结合创作的需要，经常到群众中去体验生活，丰富创作源泉。必须适当地组织和选用现成外稿，在说明词方面，应多多研究语言的生动性，学习群众的语汇，或将说明词编成“快板”、“山歌”、“莲花落”之类的唱词，力求生动活泼，通俗易懂。
    （四）应该多多翻制苏联及其他人民民主国家的适合于当前我国人民需要的幻灯片，介绍兄弟国家在生产建设上的先进经验和科学知识，适当改善幻灯片出品有时供不应求、有时产品积压的不平衡的状况。在生产和推销方面，国营的生产机构，过去不大注意推销工作，认为“我们是国营机构，不必靠广告宣传，人家自然会上门。”致使幻灯片供应不及时。放映单位迫切需要的幻灯片常常买不到，而过时的幻灯片却积压在厂里卖不出去。在调整机构的同时，并应加强企业管理，提高生产效率和产品质量，改进发行技术，使产品能及时送到群众中去。
    幻灯事业是有其光辉灿烂的发展前途的，目前已有了一定的基础，我们要在工作中不断地克服上述缺点，使这一新兴事业逐步向前迈进！
