    Yellow River Conservancy Commission Reviews Negligent Work Style

    Letter from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Ji Shutai on January 29 criticizing our commission for a "negligent work style that has caused huge losses to the country." This criticism is basically correct. We are now informing you of the results of our review.

    In January of last year, when the commission was compiling the annual material supply plan, the Shandong Yellow River Bureau reported that 233 cubic meters of shipbuilding timber would be needed in the fourth quarter. This plan was included in the commission's annual plan and reported to the Ministry of Water Resources for the record. In the third and fourth quarters, the bureau did not submit a quarterly plan, and we did not inquire in a timely manner. When the bureau urged the allocation of shipbuilding timber in the fourth quarter, the commission's planning staff were all working at the Ministry of Water Resources in Beijing, and the personnel at the agency failed to find the shipbuilding timber figures and irresponsibly replied to the bureau that "there was no such plan." The Luokou Shipping Team of the bureau then compiled a plan on October 9, requesting an additional 170 cubic meters of shipbuilding timber in the fourth quarter, which was reviewed by the commission and forwarded to the Ministry of Water Resources. At this time, the allocation of shipbuilding timber for the fourth quarter had been completed, and additional materials could only be adjusted internally. Although the Ministry of Water Resources transferred 170 cubic meters of shipbuilding timber from the Northeast, which could have been supplied by the end of November, it was not suitable for use due to its small size. Therefore, this problem had to be resolved in the preliminary allocation of materials at the beginning of this year.

    The above situation reflects the serious bureaucratic work style of the Finance Department of the commission and the serious disconnection in internal communication. We are determined to learn from this lesson and correct this shortcoming in future work.

### 黄河水利委员会检讨漫不经心的工作作风

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    黄河水利委员会检讨漫不经心的工作作风
    黄河水利委员会来信：一月二十九日人民日报刊登了读者纪书台批评本会“漫不经心的工作作风给国家造成了巨大损失”的来信。这一批评基本上是正确的，现在把我们的检查结果告诉你们。
    去年一月，本会编制年度物资供应计划时，山东黄河河务局曾申报第四季度需用的造船材二百三十三立方公尺。这项计划当时已编入本会年度计划，报水利部在案。在第三、四季度，该局没有报送季度计划，我们也没有及时查问。到第四季度该局催拨造船材时，本会编拟计划的工作人员都在北京水利部工作，在机关的人员没有查出造船材数字，就不负责任地答复该局“无此项计划”。该局洛口航运队就在十月九日编报计划，要求在第四季度增拨造船材一百七十立方公尺，由本会核转水利部。这时，第四季度造船材已经分配完毕，增拨物资只能从内部调剂。水利部虽从东北调给一百七十立方公尺造船材，十一月底即可供应，但因规格小，不宜使用。因此，这个问题只好在今年年初预拨物资中解决。
    以上情况反映了本会财务处工作中的严重官僚主义作风以及内部联系上的严重脱节现象。我们决心接受这个教训，在今后工作中纠正这种缺点。
