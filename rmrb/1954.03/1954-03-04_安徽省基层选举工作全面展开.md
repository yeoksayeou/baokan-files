    Anhui Province's grassroots election work has been fully and deeply launched. As of now, based on incomplete statistics from only five special districts—Wuhu, Anqing, Fuyang, Chuxian, and Suxian—and three cities—Bengbu, Huainan, and Anqing—a total of 7,337 grassroots units, including townships, towns, and urban districts, have commenced election work.
    Before the comprehensive launch of grassroots election work in Anhui Province, relatively thorough preparatory work was carried out. Party and government leaders at the provincial and all other levels attached great importance to the general election movement and closely monitored the preparation work. On February 9th, the Anhui Provincial Election Committee dispatched eight cadres to Anqing, Fuyang, Suxian, and Chuxian special districts, as well as Chao County, to inspect the deployment and preparation of general election work. The Anqing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued multiple instructions and notices to the county committees, making specific arrangements for the general election work, and also transferred five cadres to form a work team to go to various places to conduct in-depth supervision and guidance of the preparations for the general election. The Wuhu Special District convened an election work conference as early as the 12th of last month, summarizing the experience of pilot projects for grassroots elections, determining the timing and steps for the comprehensive launch of election work, and discussing issues such as combining the general election with production, allocating cadre strength, and establishing people's courts. A three-level cadre meeting was held to deploy spring plowing production and general election work. While convening a three-level cadre meeting of county, district, and township officials to deploy the general election work, Hanshan County also organized the cadres attending the meeting to study the general election.
    In order to ensure the smooth and healthy progress of the general election movement, various places have transferred and trained a large number of cadres. According to incomplete statistics from Wuhu, Lu'an, and Fuyang special districts, and Huainan and Tunxi cities, a total of 15,785 guiding cadres for election work have been transferred and trained, with Fuyang Special District alone accounting for 8,611.
    After the comprehensive launch of grassroots election work, various localities first conducted general election propaganda work among the people. In the propaganda, various places dispatched tens of thousands of Party reporters, propagandists, and trained cadres, using effective and popular propaganda methods and forms such as oral reports, informal discussions, recollection and comparison, individual visits, blackboard newspapers, local broadcasts, reading groups, clapper talks, and cross talks, creating a vast momentum and strong atmosphere for the general election. Newspapers and periodicals in various places also treated the general election as one of the important propaganda contents during this period. Through such extensive and in-depth propaganda, the broad masses of the people received democratic education and their political enthusiasm was high, and they threw themselves into the general election movement as masters of the country. When Pingxiao Township in Caishi District, Hanshan County, held a women's meeting to promote the general election, it was after rain and snow, the roads were muddy, and the weather was cold, but 173 women attended, accounting for 70 percent of the total number of adult women in the township. After carrying out general election propaganda in Qishibu Township, Feixi County, women generally said: "Chairman Mao leads us so well! In the old society, women could only stand by and listen when men spoke, but now women can also elect representatives like men." In the past, women in the township had the habit of visiting their parents' homes around the Spring Festival, but this year, because of the general election, fewer women visited their parents' homes. Many voters in the Shi Jialong Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township said in a casual discussion about the general election that they must elect good people as representatives to lead them to build the country into socialism and make their lives better.
    Various places closely integrated election work with production. The broad masses of the people also dedicated their achievements in production to the general election. The people of Fuyang Special District, who have overcome years of natural disasters under the leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, have launched a wave of hard work and production, determined to greet the general election with their achievements in production. The Lu Dongyang Agricultural Production Cooperative expressed its joy in celebrating the general election by planting a thousand trees. Farmers in Huji Township, Funan County, held meetings at night to discuss the general election and worked during the day, weeding 173 mu of wheat and planting 1,596 trees in three days.

    安徽省基层选举工作全面展开
    安徽省基层选举工作已经全面深入展开。到目前止，仅据芜湖、安庆、阜阳、滁县、宿县等五个专区和蚌埠、淮南、安庆等三个市的不完全统计，开始选举工作的乡、镇和市辖区等基层单位共有七千三百三十七个。
    安徽省基层选举工作全面展开前，进行了比较充分的准备工作。省和各级党政领导对于普选运动都很重视，对普选的准备工作抓得紧。安徽省选举委员会在二月九日曾派出八个干部分别到安庆、阜阳、宿县、滁县等四个专区和巢县，检查普选工作的部署和准备情况。中共安庆地委曾多次向各县委发出指示和通知，对普选工作作了具体部署，同时抽调五个干部，组成工作组到各地深入督导普选的准备工作。芜湖专区早在上月十二日就召开了选举工作会议，总结了基层选举典型试办的经验，确定了全面开展选举工作的时间、步骤，并讨论了普选结合生产、调配干部力量、建立人民法庭等问题。三级干部会议，布置了春耕生产和普选工作。含山县在召开县、区、乡三级干部会议布置普选工作的同时，还组织到会干部进行了普选学习。
    为保证普选运动顺利地健康地进行，各地抽调和训练了大批干部。据芜湖、六安、阜阳等三个专区和淮南、屯溪两市的不完全统计，共抽调和训练选举工作指导干部一万五千七百八十五名，其中仅阜阳专区就达八千六百十一名。
    基层选举工作全面展开后，各地首先向人民群众进行了普选宣传工作。宣传中，各地出动了数万名党的报告员、宣传员和经过训练的干部，运用了口头报告、漫谈讨论、回忆对比、个别访问和黑板报、土广播、读报组、快板、相声等有效且为群众喜闻乐见的宣传方法和形式，造成了浩大的普选声势和强烈的普选气氛。各地报纸和刊物也在这个时期把普选作为重要的宣传内容之一。经过这样广泛深入的宣传，广大人民受到民主教育，政治热情高涨起来，以国家主人翁的姿态投入了普选运动。含山县采石区平晓乡在召开妇女会议宣传普选时，正在雨雪之后，道路泥泞，天气寒冷，但是到会的妇女有一百七十三人，占全乡成年妇女总数的百分之七十。肥西县七十埠乡在进行了普选宣传后，妇女普遍说：“毛主席领导得真好！在旧社会男子讲话妇女只能站在旁边听，现在妇女也能和男子一样选代表了。”过去该乡妇女在春节前后都有走娘家的习惯，今年春节期间因进行普选，妇女走娘家的就少了。该乡施夹衖农业生产合作社的许多选民在漫谈普选时表示：一定要把好人选出来当代表，带领我们把国家建设成社会主义，使我们的生活更好。
    各地在进行选举工作时，密切结合了生产。广大群众也都以生产上的成绩向普选献礼。在中国共产党和人民政府领导与支持下战胜了连年灾荒的阜阳专区人民，掀起了努力生产的热潮，决心用生产上的成就迎接普选。吕东扬农业生产合作社以植树千棵来表示欢庆普选的心意。阜南县胡集乡农民晚上开会讨论普选，白天生产，三天锄麦一百七十三亩，植树一千五百九十六棵。
