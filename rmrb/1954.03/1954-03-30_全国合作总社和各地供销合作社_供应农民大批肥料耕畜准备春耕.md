Xinhua News Agency, March 29th - According to rough estimates from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the national demand for commercial fertilizer from farmers aiming to increase production of grain, cotton, and other crops will rise from approximately five million tons last year to around seven million tons this year. The cooperative system nationwide has expanded its fertilizer management plan accordingly, based on farmers' needs for increased production. According to incomplete statistics, various types of cake fertilizer prepared by cooperatives in various regions before the start of spring ploughing have increased by 40% compared to the same period last year, and chemical fertilizers have increased by 14%. Cooperatives in Hunan, Shanxi, Anhui, and other regions had already stored more than half of their fertilizer supply plan for this year by the end of last December. The total amount of fertilizer stored and supplied to farmers by Hubei Province's cooperatives around the start of spring ploughing reached more than 250 million jin. Now that farmers have started spring ploughing, the work of cooperatives supplying farmers with fertilizer for spring ploughing is fully underway. The North China District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had supplied farmers with over 115 million jin of various types of cake fertilizer by the end of January. One-third of the fertilizer stored by Jiangxi Province's cooperatives has been transported to fertilizer-deficient areas. Many cooperatives in Jiangsu and Anhui have signed supply contracts with agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Xinjiang, Yongji, Jiangxian, and Wenxi counties in Shanxi Province have signed contracts with more than 560 agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations to supply fertilizer. According to the contracts signed between supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various regions, farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation will receive the necessary fertilizer first. At the same time, cooperatives in various regions have also taken into account the needs of individual farmers in their supply efforts.

Historically, Chinese farmers have mainly used farm manure and rarely had money to buy commercial fertilizer. After liberation, with the development of agricultural production, farmers expanded their production investments, and the amount of fertilizer purchased also increased continuously. The amount of commercial fertilizer supplied by cooperatives in various regions within the customs in 1953 was equal to 368% of the supply in 1951. After the state implemented planned grain purchase last winter, farmers invested 30% to 40% of their grain sales revenue into production, and the demand for fertilizer this year has reached a new peak. To meet the large needs of farmers, cooperatives in various regions have begun to pay attention to using local materials and managing natural fertilizers, which are low in cost and very popular among farmers. The Dai Yucai mutual aid group in Siyang County used natural fertilizer for their corn last year, and their net income was six times the cost. This spring, the amount of phosphate mineral fertilizer (limestone, etc.) and miscellaneous fertilizer managed by cooperatives in various regions has greatly increased.

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th - The number of draft animals supplied to farmers by supply and marketing cooperatives across the country has greatly increased. After the country began implementing planned grain purchases last November, farmers received large amounts of money from grain sales and generally requested to increase draft animals. From that time until the end of January this year, cooperatives in thirteen provinces including Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan, have supplied farmers with more than 45,000 draft animals. Before and after the spring ploughing this year, the demand for draft animals from farmers is even greater, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have generally begun to manage draft animals in large quantities according to the requirements of farmers. Seven provinces and cities including Henan, Ningxia, Hebei, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Changchun, as well as two special districts in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, plan to manage 132,972 draft animals this year, and some of these draft animals will be supplied to farmers during the spring ploughing period. Other provinces and cities are also actively carrying out the purchase and transportation of draft animals. Counties in Heilongjiang have universally held livestock exchange meetings, where cooperatives supplied and farmers exchanged and sold small animals for large animals totaling more than 21,000 heads of livestock. The People's Bank of China in Kaitong County in the province also issued 500 million yuan in livestock loans. The Hebei Provincial Cooperative Federation sent a draft animal purchasing team to Heilongjiang, Henan, and other places to purchase draft animals and has now secured a supply of more than 11,300 heads of draft animals. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative system sent personnel to northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Luohe in Henan, and other places to purchase draft animals and estimates that it can purchase 15,000 heads before and after the spring ploughing.

Farmers in various regions not only need a significantly increased number of draft animals, but also, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, a large number of draft animals are now raised centrally and used collectively. At this time, farmers feel that it is not cost-effective to raise small draft animals such as cattle and donkeys, and the demand for large draft animals such as horses and mules has also increased. The increased use of new large-scale farm implements has also increased the demand for horses and mules with strong traction. According to the plan to promote 300,000 new farm implements this year, more than 400,000 additional draft horses are needed. However, the breeding of draft animals in our country is currently very unbalanced. The breeding volume of cattle and donkeys is relatively high, while the breeding volume of horses and mules, which farmers need more of, is very low. According to a 1953 survey, the current breeding rate of horses in our country is only 3%, and the annual breeding of horses and mules is only about 200,000, which is far from meeting the needs of farmers. This year, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives has decided to import 10,000 horses from the Mongolian People's Republic. Most of these imported horses are mares carrying foals or pregnant, which will not only increase productivity but also increase the breeding volume of horses and mules for draft animals in the future.

    全国合作总社和各地供销合作社
    供应农民大批肥料耕畜准备春耕
    【新华社二十九日讯】据中华全国合作社联合总社概略的计算，今年全国农民为增产粮食、棉花等农作物，对商品肥料的需要量将由去年的五百万吨增加到七百万吨上下。全国合作社系统根据农民增产的需要，相应地扩大了经营肥料的计划。据不完全统计，在春耕开始前，各地合作社已备妥的各种饼肥比去年同期增加了百分之四十，化学肥料增加了百分之十四。湖南、山西、安徽等地合作社，在去年十二月底储备的肥料就占今年肥料供应计划的一半以上。湖北省合作社在春耕开始前后储备和供应到农民手中的肥料，总计达两亿五千多万斤。现在农民已开犁春耕，合作社供应农民春耕用肥的工作正在全面开始。华北区供销合作社在一月底已供应到农民手中的各种饼肥达一亿一千五百多万斤。江西省合作社储备的肥料有三分之一已运到缺肥地区。江苏、安徽不少合作社已和农业互助合作组织签订了供应合同。山西省新绛、永济、绛县、闻喜四个县的供销合作社和五百六十多个农业互助合作组织订下了供应肥料的合同。按照各地供销合作社和农业互助合作组织订下的合同，参加互助合作的农民将首先得到需要的肥料。同时，各地合作社在供应中也照顾了单干农民的需要。
    我国农民历史上以用农家肥为主，很少有钱去购买商品肥料。解放后随着农业生产的发展，农民扩大了生产投资，购买肥料的数量也不断增加。一九五三年关内各地合作社供应的商品肥料，已等于一九五一年供应量的百分之三百六十八。去年冬季国家实行粮食计划收购后，农民把百分之三十到四十的售粮款投入生产，今年对肥料的需要量达到了新的高峰。为满足农民的大量需要，各地合作社在经营肥料中，已开始注意就地取材，经营自然肥料，这种肥料的成本低，极为农民欢迎。泗阳县戴玉才互助组去年种的玉米使用了自然肥料，纯收入为成本的六倍。今年春季，各地合作社经营的磷矿质肥料（灰石等）和杂肥的数量大有增加。
    【新华社二十九日讯】全国各地供销合作社供应农民耕畜的数量大大增加。去年十一月份全国开始实行粮食计划收购后，农民得到大批售粮款，普遍要求增加耕畜。从那个时候起到今年一月底止，河南、山东、山西、河北、四川、黑龙江、辽东、辽西、松江、云南、陕西、甘肃、绥远等十三个省份的合作社，已供应给农民的耕畜达四万五千多头。今年春耕前后，农民对耕畜的需要量更大，各地供销社普遍根据农民的要求，开始大量经营耕畜。河南、宁夏、河北、山西、江苏、长春等七省市以及云南、四川省的两个专区，今年计划经营的耕畜达十三万二千九百七十二头，这些耕畜有一部分将在春耕期间供给农民。其他各省市也都正在积极进行耕畜的购运工作。黑龙江各县普遍召开了牲畜交流会，会上由合作社供应的和农民相互串换、卖小买大的牲畜共计二万一千多头。该省开通县人民银行并发放了五亿元牲畜贷款。河北省合作社联合总社派出购耕畜采购小组到黑龙江、河南等地采购，现已掌握耕畜货源一万一千三百多头。山东省合作社系统派人到皖北、苏北、河南漯河等地采购耕畜，估计在春耕前后可以采购一万五千头。
    各地农民不但需要耕畜的数量大大增加，而且随着互助合作运动的发展，大批耕畜已集中饲养、集体使用，这时农民感到牛、驴等小耕畜饲养不合算，对大耕畜马匹、骡子的需要量也增多了。采用新式大型农具的数量增多，也增大了对牵引力强的马匹、骡子的需要量。按今年计划推广的三十万件新式农具计算，就需要新增加耕马四十多万匹。但我国目前耕畜增殖品种很不平衡，牛、驴的繁殖量较高，而农民需要多的马、骡的繁殖量很低。据一九五三年调查，我国现有的马匹繁殖率仅达百分之三，每年繁殖马、骡不过二十万头左右，远不能满足农民的需要。今年中华全国合作社联合总社决定从蒙古人民共和国进口马一万匹。此项进口马匹，大部分是带驹、怀驹的母马，不但可以增加生产力，而且将增加今后马、骡耕畜的繁殖量。
