Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 17th: Premier Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sent a telegram to Chairman Malenkov of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the 16th, congratulating him on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. The telegram reads as follows:

    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and warm congratulations to you, respected Comrade Chairman, and through you to the Soviet government and the great Soviet people, on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the entire Korean people, and myself.

    Over the past five years, the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed between the DPRK and the Soviet Union has become one of the important guarantees for strengthening the friendship and economic and cultural ties between the people of the two countries and for their prosperity and development.

    The selfless assistance continuously provided by the Soviet people and their government to the Korean people has played a tremendous role in the victories achieved by the Korean people during the past period of peaceful construction and in the just war against the American imperialists for freedom and independence. This continued assistance is of great significance for restoring and constructing the war-torn Korean people's economy, peacefully resolving the Korean issue, and ensuring peace and security in the Far East.

    The Korean people ardently hope to further strengthen the friendship and unity between the people of the two countries and wish the great Soviet people new achievements in the construction of communism.

    In addition: Kim Doo-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, and Foreign Minister Nam Il also sent telegrams to Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and Foreign Minister Molotov on the 16th, expressing their congratulations.
