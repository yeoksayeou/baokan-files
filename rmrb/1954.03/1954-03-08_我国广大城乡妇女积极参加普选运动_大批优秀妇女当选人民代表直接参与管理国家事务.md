    Broad Masses of Urban and Rural Women in Our Country Actively Participate in the General Election Movement
    A Large Number of Outstanding Women are Elected as People's Representatives to Directly Participate in the Management of State Affairs
    Through the general election movement, the political status of women in our country has been further improved, and a large number of outstanding women have been elected as representatives of grassroots political power, directly participating in the management of state affairs.
    Currently, the general election movement in our country has been fully launched nationwide. The broad masses of women in urban and rural areas are participating in the general election activities with great interest and enthusiasm. Women's federation organizations in almost all regions convened meetings at the beginning of the general election movement to mobilize women to participate. In the 215 grassroots units in Qinghai Province that conducted the first phase of the general election, generally one or two women's representative meetings were held during the election period, and 95 percent of female voters participated in the election. In Tianjin, after in-depth publicity, every female voter in the city basically understood the significance of the general election and thus enthusiastically participated in the election activities. The general election movement has progressed relatively quickly in the Northeast region, and the ideological awareness of the broad masses of women has been further improved after the general election. Taking Paoziyan Village in Yushu County, Jilin Province, as an example, the village had only three female cadres before the general election; after the general election, 35 new female activists emerged throughout the village. According to statistics from 30 streets in the Tiexi, Huanggu, and Beiguan districts of Shenyang, 52 women served as jurors in temporary people's courts during the general election movement. They all demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and conscientiously assisted the people's courts in handling election cases. In the Zhanqian Street of the city, an old woman named Chen Yazhao reported four landlord class elements who had stolen the right to vote when reviewing voter qualifications.
    Women have realized from their own experiences the great significance of the people holding political power for the cause of women's liberation. The broad masses of women in Shanxi Province recalled their political and economic status in the old society, and they loved the people's democratic regime even more, enthusiastically participating in the election. Rural women north of Chaohu in Anhui Province have historically suffered from the oppression and rule of the feudal system. Since ancient times, other places have been characterized by "men plowing and women weaving," but here, there is a saying that goes "Working the fields, working the fields, the old woman goes forward," and "Men weave cloth, women farm the fields." Before liberation, female infanticide was often cruelly practiced here. In this general election movement, a female voter named Pan Chunlan, who had been forced by her family to drown her own daughter before liberation, participated in the election holding her other daughter. She said with emotion: "If we had a democratic regime earlier, my daughter would not have been killed alive!" Because the democratic regime directly protects their interests, all female voters participated in the election with great interest and enthusiasm. The day of voting in various places truly formed a solemn day for reviewing the strength of women. Whether young, middle-aged, or elderly women, many of them wore festive costumes with flowers in their hair and enthusiastically participated in the election. According to materials from various regions, the proportion of women participating in the election generally reached more than 80 percent. In Sichuan, Xikang, Chongqing, Chengdu, and other provinces and cities, as well as in parts of Guizhou and Yunnan, where grassroots elections have been completed, the participation rate of women in the election reached more than 90 percent. In Baimiao Township, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, 100 percent of female voters in 25 electoral districts participated in the election. In Guizhou Province, a 104-year-old Miao woman named Tian Lao Zutai also happily participated in the election with three generations of her family.
    In this general election movement, a large number of outstanding women in various places were elected as people's representatives, directly managing state affairs. The large-scale participation of women in political power work foreshadows that grassroots political power in our country will have a broader and closer connection with the people. According to incomplete statistics from the six cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Fushun, more than 2,200 women were elected as people's representatives. In the nine counties of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang provinces, 814 of the 3,900 people's representatives elected in 135 townships were women. In various places, many female people's representatives have been elected as members of district and township people's governments and representatives to county people's congresses. In 1,703 townships in 39 counties including Jie County and Qi County in Shanxi Province, 1,977 women were elected as members of township people's governments and township heads, including 723 township heads and deputy township heads, and 1,254 members of township people's governments. These outstanding individuals, after being entrusted by the people, faithfully fulfilled their duties. In the Northeast region, thanks to the hard work of a large number of female people's representatives and the increased awareness of the women themselves, the number of women participating in production in the region's campaign to increase production and conserve food last year was higher than in any previous year. Zhao Songqiu, a people's representative from Heping District in Shenyang, actively collected proposals and helped people solve difficulties after being elected. Now she has become a role model for people's representatives throughout the city to learn from. In Shanghai, more than 1,000 outstanding women were elected as district people's representatives in the general election movement. Now they are contributing their strength to the country's construction in various work positions in industry, culture, education, and municipal administration. In many areas, after women are elected as people's representatives, they not only receive the support of the broad masses but also the encouragement of their families and the assistance of male cadres, which makes their work more active and their working ability improved faster. In Shiqiaozi District of Benxi City, seven women were elected as village heads and deputy village heads in seven villages. After they were elected, many of them even considered work while sleeping at night and worked tirelessly to study and improve their abilities. Now, some have initially learned the working methods of the mass line. Kang Shuqin, deputy village head of Xiangshandong Village in the city, has consistently gone deep into the masses after the general election, leading the groups and households to respond to the call of the higher authorities, carrying out the campaign to increase production and conserve food and autumn harvest work, and as a result, the tasks were successfully completed on schedule. Kang Shuqin also actively takes care of housework in the evenings and spare time, which not only won the support of the masses but also the support and encouragement of her family.

    我国广大城乡妇女积极参加普选运动
    大批优秀妇女当选人民代表直接参与管理国家事务
    经过普选运动，我国妇女的政治地位有了进一步的提高，大批优秀妇女当选为基层政权的代表，直接参与管理国家事务。
    目前我国普选运动已在全国范围内全面展开。广大城乡中的妇女群众都抱着极大的兴趣和热情参加普选活动。几乎所有地区的妇女联合会组织都在普选运动一开始便召开了会议，动员妇女群众参加普选运动。青海省第一期进行普选的二百一十五个基层单位，在普选期间一般都开过一次到二次妇女代表会议，百分之九十五的女选民参加了选举。天津市经过深入宣传，市内每一个女选民基本上都了解了普选的意义，因而踊跃地参加选举活动。东北地区普选运动进展较快，广大妇女经过普选以后，思想觉悟已进一步提高。以吉林省榆树县泡子沿村为例，该村在普选以前只有三名妇女干部，普选以后，全村涌现出三十五名新的妇女积极分子。据沈阳市铁西、皇姑、北关三个区三十个街的统计，在普选运动中，有五十二名妇女担任了临时人民法庭陪审员的职务，她们都发挥了高度的积极性，认真地协助人民法庭处理普选案件。该市站前街有一位名叫陈亚照的老大娘，在审查选民资格时，检举了四个窃取选举权利的地主阶级分子。
    妇女们从切身的体验中，了解到人民自己掌握了政权对于妇女解放事业的重大意义。山西省广大妇女回忆起在旧社会所处的政治和经济地位，更加热爱人民民主政权，踊跃地参加了选举。安徽省巢湖以北的农村妇女，历来饱受封建制度的压迫和统治，从古以来别处是“男耕女织”，这里却流行着“做田，做田，老婆头子向前”、“男的织布，女的种田”的谚语。解放以前，这里常常残酷地溺杀女婴。在这次普选运动中，有一位在解放前曾被家庭强迫溺死自己女孩的女选民潘春兰，抱着她另一个女孩参加了选举，她感动地说：“要是早有了民主政权，我那个女孩就不会活活弄死了！”因为民主政权直接保护了她们的利益，所有女选民都以极大的兴趣和热情参加了选举。各地投票的那天，真正形成了检阅妇女力量的庄严的日子。无论青年、中年或老年妇女，她们很多人都穿着节日的盛装，头上插着鲜花，热烈地参加选举。根据各地材料，妇女参加选举的比例一般都达到百分之八十以上。已经完成基层选举的四川、西康、重庆、成都等省市及贵州、云南一部分地区，妇女参加选举的达到百分之九十以上。陕西省临潼县白庙乡有二十五个选区的女选民百分之百地参加了选举。贵州省有一个一百零四岁的苗族老人田老祖太，也欢欢喜喜地带着全家三代参加了选举。
    在这次普选运动中，各地有大批优秀的妇女被选为人民代表，直接管理国家事务。妇女们大量地参与政权工作，预示着我国基层政权将更加广泛地和人民群众发生更紧密的联系。根据北京、上海、天津、西安、武汉、抚顺六个市的不完全统计，当选的女人民代表有二千二百多名。青海、甘肃、新疆三省九个县的一百三十五个乡所选出的三千九百个人民代表中有八百一十四个是妇女。各地并有许多女人民代表被选为区、乡人民政府的委员和县人民代表大会的代表。山西省解县、祁县等三十九个县的一千七百零三个乡中，妇女被选为乡人民政府委员和乡长的有一千九百七十七人，其中正副乡长七百二十三人。乡人民政府委员一千二百五十四人。这些优秀人物受到人民的信托以后，忠实地履行了她们的职能。东北地区由于大批女人民代表的努力工作和妇女群众本身觉悟的提高，去年全区在增产节约粮食的运动中，妇女参加生产的人数比以往任何一年都多。沈阳市和平区人民代表赵松秋当选以后，广泛地和选民联系，积极地搜集提案和帮助人民解决困难，现在她已成为全市人民代表学习的榜样。上海市在普选运动中，有一千多名优秀妇女当选为区人民代表。现在她们正在工业、文教和市政等各种工作岗位上，为国家建设事业贡献自己的力量。不少地区的妇女当选为人民代表以后，不仅得到广大群众的支持，而且得到家庭的鼓励和男干部的帮助，这就使她们的工作更加积极，工作能力得到更快的提高。本溪市石桥子区有七个村选出了七名正副女村长，她们当选以后，有许多人晚上睡觉也考虑工作，并且孜孜不倦地进行学习，提高自己的能力。现在，有的已初步学会了走群众路线的工作方法。该市向山东村副村长康淑琴从普选以后，工作一贯深入群众，带动各组各户响应上级号召，开展增产节约运动和秋收工作，结果按期胜利地完成了任务。康淑琴晚间和空闲时间还积极料理家务事情，这样就不仅得到了群众的拥护，而且得到了家庭的支持和鼓励。
