Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 2nd

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued its "Final Report" on February 20th. The full text of the report is as follows:

**Preamble**

1. The Commission's "Interim Report" was submitted to the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers on December 28, 1953. The "Interim Report" discusses the Commission's activities from September 9, 1953, to December 23, 1953, which includes the most important part of the Commission's work, namely the handling and interpretation of the repatriation of prisoners of war.

2. The events discussed in the "Final Report" occurred after the events described in the "Interim Report." Therefore, the "Final Report" is a supplement to the "Interim Report" and not a replacement.

**Chapter 1: Termination of Explanation**

1. On December 23, 1953, the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers, in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation," submitted a plan to the Commission for the continuation of the explanation work. They requested that the remaining unexplained prisoners from Camp Bu-4 be taken out for explanation. In a letter to the Commission's Chairman on December 23, 1953, they stated:

   "Since the beginning of the explanation work, there have been five interruptions, totaling sixty days lost. The first and third interruptions were quickly resolved, resulting in only two days lost. The other interruptions were prolonged due to the Commission's passive attitude. During the fourth and fifth interruptions, despite the Commission's responsibility under the 'Scope of Authority' and 'Detailed Rules' to provide isolation arrangements to resume the explanation work, and despite the Chairman's promise on November 6 to provide isolation tents, and despite the Commission's multiple changes to the explanation camps to facilitate the taking out of prisoners for explanation, the Commission ignored all these efforts. Even after providing isolation tents on December 10, the Commission insisted that spies would not allow prisoners to be isolated, preventing the explanation work from proceeding. However, due to our insistence, prisoners were isolated on December 21, and the explanation work resumed. The claim that the Commission could not act because spies refused isolation and explanation has been proven false. On the contrary, as of December 21, if the Commission had firmly stopped the spies' obstruction under the 'Scope of Authority,' the explanation days would not have been lost. Therefore, the significant loss of explanation days, for which the United Nations Command is primarily responsible, is also directly attributable to the Commission's failure to enforce the 'Scope of Authority.'"

   "Now, our explanation work has only been conducted for ten days by December 23. We firmly demand that the explanation work continue until the full ninety-day period is completed. We believe that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should satisfy this reasonable request."

2. At its 65th meeting on December 23, 1953, the Commission considered the request from the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers for the continuation of the explanation work. The views of the Commission's members are summarized below.

3. The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Commission stated that the "Scope of Authority" is an integral whole; only the Commission has the right to explain; the explanation of each article must be consistent with the explanation of other articles; the termination of the explanation is related to Article 8 of the "Scope of Authority"; Article 8 stipulates a ninety-day explanation period; therefore, the "contact with prisoners by representatives" in Article 8 refers to the ninety-day explanation period; since the explanation has only been conducted for ten days, it must be continued to complete the full period; and only by continuing the explanation can the Commission fulfill the key Article 8 of the "Scope of Authority."

4. The Czechoslovak and Polish members recalled that the decision on the ninety-day explanation period was a compromise reached after lengthy negotiations between the belligerent parties. One side proposed a six-month explanation period, while the other side sought to limit the explanation period to thirty or sixty days. The ninety-day period stipulated in the "Scope of Authority" is a compromise. Setting December 23, 1953, as the termination date for the explanation without guaranteeing the full ninety-day period is arbitrary.

5. The Swedish member stated that the meaning of Article 8 of the "Scope of Authority" is clear; Article 8 explicitly states that the explanation work for prisoners of war should be completed "within ninety days from the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over." Since the Commission took over on September 24, 1953, the explanation work should end on December 23, 1953. Therefore, the interpretation of Article 8 by the Czechoslovak and Polish members does not conform to its content. Moreover, Article 11 of the "Scope of Authority" clearly states that the contact between the representatives of one party and the prisoners should be terminated after the ninety-day period from the date the prisoners are handed over to the Commission. Regarding the compensation principle advocated by the Polish member, the Swedish member stated that since the Commission agreed to the letters sent to both sides on September 24, 1953, the Commission has acknowledged the ninety-day period as fixed and has also acknowledged that the Commission has no authority to change this period. The sole purpose of Article 11 of the "Scope of Authority" is to prevent the indefinite detention of prisoners of war, and there is no record in the armistice negotiations that supports the opposite view. Therefore, he advocated that since both sides have not agreed to extend the explanation period, the Commission should implement the "Scope of Authority" as it is and adhere to the timetable stipulated therein.

6. The Swiss member stated that Article 8 of the "Scope of Authority" does not say "within" a ninety-day period, but "within" ninety days; this means that the explanation work should be completed within this period, and after this period, the representatives should no longer contact the prisoners. The compensation principle has been discussed in the Military Armistice Commission but has not been agreed upon on this basis. The Commission has no authority to change the period stipulated in the "Scope of Authority" for the explanation work.

7. The Indian delegation believed that there are two separate issues here: first, from the perspective of the purpose of the "Scope of Authority," whether it is necessary to extend the explanation period; second, whether the Commission has the authority to allow this extension. Although the Indian delegation supported the extension of the explanation period, they believed that only through an agreement between the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers could the extension be implemented. The Commission's letters to both sides on September 24 and 28, 1953 (see "Interim Report" paragraphs 36, 37, and Appendix 9) assumed that the Commission itself had no authority to allow the extension of the explanation period; and Article 11 clearly states: "The custody of prisoners of war... after the expiration of ninety days... the contact of the representatives... shall be terminated..." Since the date of custody transfer is fixed, the date of contact termination is also fixed. Only through an agreement between both sides can the extension of the date and the explanation be possible.

8. The Commission's final decision on the termination of the explanation work was communicated to the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers by the Chairman in a letter dated December 24, 1953 (see Appendix 1 (2)). This letter was adopted by a majority vote at the Commission's 66th meeting on December 24, 1953, with the Czechoslovak and Polish members voting against. The following is an excerpt from the letter:

   "The Commission has no authority to allow your representatives to contact prisoners of war to conduct explanations as stipulated in Article 8 of the 'Scope of Authority.' Only the signatory countries of the armistice agreement can reach an agreement to extend any contact time."

9. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers protested the Commission's decision. This protest was made by General Lee Sang-cho in a letter to the Chairman on December 27, 1953 (see Appendix 1 (3)). The following is an excerpt from the letter:

   "The provisions of the 'Scope of Authority' are an integrated whole and cannot be arbitrarily divided. The 'Scope of Authority' guarantees a ninety-day explanation period to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation. This fundamental spirit is an indispensable premise for Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority.' Due to the deliberate delay by the U.S. side in the construction of explanation equipment, the obstruction by spies preventing prisoners from listening to explanations, and the resistance to the isolation of prisoners, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's failure to take effective measures to break the spies' control over the prisoners and ensure the necessary conditions for the explanation work, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides has not only not started on time but has also not been conducted continuously. By December 23, the Korean and Chinese sides have only conducted ten days of explanation work, and less than 15% of the prisoners have listened to the explanations. The premise of Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority' has thus been completely destroyed. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only failed to take necessary measures to ensure the ninety-day explanation work but also, three days after the explanation work was resumed through the efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, arbitrarily announced the termination of the explanation work under the pretext of the so-called mandatory provisions of Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority.' This is completely disregardful of the facts, arbitrarily divides the articles, and is absolutely unconvincing. Is Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority' the only mandatory provision? Does the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have the authority to delay the explanation work for twenty days, to allow the U.S. side and its arranged spies to interrupt the explanation work for sixty days, and to allow nearly 85% of the nearly 20,000 of our captured personnel to have no opportunity to listen to explanations, but does not have the authority to ensure the ninety-day explanation work as stipulated in Article 8 of the 'Scope of Authority'? The decision by the majority of the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to terminate the explanation work is obviously incompatible with the impartial and just position of the neutral nations."

**Chapter 2: Interpretation of Article 11 of the "Scope of Authority"**

10. After the Commission decided by a majority vote that the stipulated explanation period had ended and could only be extended through an agreement between both sides, it proceeded to determine the further measures to be taken for the handling of prisoners of war. In the letter accompanying the "Interim Report" submitted to both sides on December 28, 1953, the Chairman stated:

   "As the Chairman and Executive of the Commission, I wish to express a hope shared by all other members of the Commission, that you will give serious consideration to the handling of prisoners of war in a manner consistent with the basic objectives embodied in the 'Scope of Authority.'"

11. Paragraph 104 of the "Interim Report" drew the attention of both sides to the specific problems faced by the Commission:

   "According to Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority,' the Commission has an obligation to 'hand over the problem of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the expiration of ninety days... to the political conference proposed to be convened under Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement...'. Such a political conference has not yet been realized. Therefore, the Commission cannot submit the handling of these prisoners to the political conference and must submit the entire problem to both sides for consideration in accordance with the Commission's report. At the same time, the manner in which Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority' should be implemented should also be considered, especially the problem of announcing 'any prisoner of war who has not exercised his right to repatriation within one hundred and twenty days after being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody and has not been agreed upon by the political conference for any other handling... shall be released from his prisoner of war status and become a civilian' (see footnote in paragraph 104 of the 'Interim Report' for the reservation made by the Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Commission)."

12. To fully implement the "Scope of Authority," including Article 11, the Chairman submitted a memorandum to the Commission (see Appendix 2 (1)) outlining several more important issues facing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force. The Chairman also proposed a draft letter to the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers (see Appendix 2 (2)) for the Commission's consideration. The Commission considered this draft letter and memorandum at its 68th meeting on January 2, 1954.

13. The Swiss member of the Commission stated that while he did not oppose the purpose of the two documents, he opposed their wording, finding them contradictory and misleading. The Swedish member also stated that he disagreed with the letter and the memorandum regarding the explanation period, custody of prisoners of war, and the dissolution of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

14. The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Commission stated that although they had already expressed their specific views on the various items listed in the memorandum, they still believed it would be appropriate to clarify the positions of both sides. They said they supported the Chairman's suggestion to submit the memorandum to both sides.

15. The Commission approved the Chairman's draft letter for submitting the memorandum to both sides without any amendments by a vote of three to zero. The Swedish and Swiss members abstained.

16. The views of the United Nations Command on the Commission's "Interim Report" and the issues raised in the Chairman's letter and memorandum of January 2, 1954, are seen in the two letters from General Mark W. Clark, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, to the Chairman of the Commission on January 3 and 6, 1954 (see Appendix 2 (3)). The views of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers were communicated to the Chairman in a letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on January 7, 1954 (see Appendix 2 (4)).

17. On January 11, 1954, the Swedish member proposed that the Commission consider his draft resolution (see Appendix 2 (5)). He proposed that the Commission should resolve:

   "With regard to the handling of prisoners of war, Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority' should be interpreted as follows: the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should announce on January 22, 1954, that prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation shall be released from their prisoner of war status and become civilians. This is on the assumption that before the aforementioned date, the political conference mentioned in Article 11 of the 'Scope of Authority' has not agreed on any other handling, or because the political conference has not been convened before that day, or because the political conference, although convened, has not reached any other agreement on handling by that day."

   The Commission discussed this draft resolution at its 70th meeting on January 11 and 12, 1954. The Commission rejected the draft resolution supported by the Swiss member. The speeches of the Commission's members supporting or opposing the Swedish draft resolution are recorded in Appendix 2 (6).

**Chapter 3: Handling of Prisoners of War**

18. In the "Interim Report" submitted to the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers, the Commission stated several facts and circumstances that had existed and, for the most part, continued to exist, surrounding the Commission's efforts to fulfill its responsibilities regarding the implementation of the "Scope of Authority." Due to these facts and circumstances, only a small number of prisoners of war exercised their right to repatriation, and they did so secretly or at the risk of their lives. However, during the Commission's custody, a much larger number of prisoners of war were unable to utilize the procedures for exercising their right to repatriation as stipulated in the "Scope of Authority" and the "Detailed Rules" formulated based on the "Scope of Authority."

   Note: The Swedish and Swiss members, when referring to their "Individual Reports" attached to the Commission's "Interim Report," believed that although prisoner organizations existed, prisoners had the opportunity to apply for repatriation during the Commission's custody. The fact that 638 prisoners of war were repatriated, and 136 of them were through the explanation procedure, is proof of this.

19. The basic purpose of the "Scope of Authority" is "to ensure that all prisoners of war... have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation." The majority of the Commission's members felt that every effort must be made to ensure the further and more complete implementation of the procedures and purposes of the "Scope of Authority." Considering this purpose, the majority of the Commission's members agreed to the Chairman's letter to both sides and the accompanying memorandum (see paragraph 12 and Appendix 2 (1), (2)).

20. The response from the United Nations Command (see paragraph 16 and Appendix 2 (3)) clearly stated opposition to the continuation of the explanation. The United Nations Command believed there was no reason for any further discussion on the handling of unrepatriated prisoners of war and questioned whether the Indian Custodial Force had the right to custody prisoners of war after January 23, 1954, at 00:01.

21. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers agreed that the explanation period should be extended, the explanation should be resumed, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force should continue to perform "their unfinished legal duties."

22. Since the majority of the Commission's members had decided (see paragraph 8) that the explanation period could only be extended through an agreement between both sides, and such an agreement had not been reached, the Commission was in a dilemma regarding the handling of prisoners of war. The Commission was even unable to implement the mandatory provisions of Article 11. This provision requires the Commission to submit the handling of unrepatriated prisoners of war to the political conference proposed to be convened under Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement.

   Note: The Swedish and Swiss members believed that the "Scope of Authority" clearly stipulates that regardless of how much time the explanation work took, the explanation period should end on the 90th day after the takeover. The aforementioned members also believed that only if the political conference is convened within 120 days after the takeover, the provision to submit the prisoner of war issue to the political conference can be mandatory.

23. When the Commission rejected the Swedish draft resolution, it stated that it could not release the prisoners of war as civilians. Due to Article 24 of the "Scope of Authority," this position later became a binding decision for the Commission (see paragraph 33).

24. In the circumstances described in paragraphs 18 to 23, the Chairman of the Commission, as the Executive of the Commission and as the representative of the country providing the custodial force, wrote to both sides on January 14, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (1), (2)). The Chairman proposed that both sides return the custody of prisoners of war to the original detaining parties before January 23, 1954. The following is a summary of the relevant parts of the letter:

   "As the Chairman and Executive of the Commission, I wish to declare in the clearest terms: I am returning the custody of prisoners of war to the original detaining parties because I can neither maintain custody of the prisoners of war nor further implement the 'Scope of Authority,' nor release them. I am doing this without intending to change their status or their final handling. Furthermore, in accordance with the Commission's authority to interpret the 'Scope of Authority,' the Commission believes that any change in the status of prisoners of war, whether by announcing them as civilians or by any other means, requires the prior implementation of the explanation work and the political conference steps; such steps must be carried out to a legal conclusion in accordance with the aforementioned authority (Scope of Authority), unless both sides agree on other steps or measures regarding the status and handling of prisoners of war. Any unilateral action by any party will not be in accordance with the 'Scope of Authority.' In taking this path, I am acting out of a sincere desire to advance the purposes of the Armistice Agreement, to follow legal and impartial procedures in the current situation, to avoid the possibility of violence, and to act in accordance with the purposes and spirit of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war."

25. The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Commission opposed and protested the return of the custody of prisoners of war to the original detaining parties. Their statements on this issue are recorded in Appendix 3 (2a).

26. Although the Swedish and Swiss members opposed the Chairman's proposal to both sides and his unilateral action, based on humanitarian and practical reasons, they believed that returning the custody of prisoners of war to the original detaining parties was reasonable.

27. The United Nations Command, in its reply to the Chairman's letter of January 14, 1954, on January 16, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (3)), stated that although it was willing to take custody of the prisoners of war, it was also determined to "release" them on January 23, 1954. The following is an excerpt from the reply:

   "I reiterate that the United Nations Command is firmly convinced that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has the solemn duty to fulfill its responsibilities and release all prisoners of war who have refused repatriation as civilians by January 23, 00:01. The failure of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to fulfill this duty would be an important element in evading the 'Scope of Authority,' and the United Nations Command cannot agree to an action that constitutes a breach of contract by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The United Nations Command cannot agree to take custody of these prisoners of war under the conditions you proposed. However, given that you have declared to unilaterally release the prisoners of war starting from January 20, the United Nations Command is prepared to arrange for their reception and handling. It must be clearly understood that our reception of these individuals after they leave the demilitarized zone is out of respect for humanitarian considerations and to ensure that the prisoners of war continue to enjoy the benefits specified in the agreement to the fullest extent possible. The United Nations Command will respect its obligations under the agreement on prisoners of war and treat them as completely free individuals, just like civilians, on January 23. You are already aware of the detailed reception plan that the United Nations Command has already made. The return of personnel to the United Nations Command before January 23, 00:01, can only be considered as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's failure to fully perform its duties, but it must be emphasized that this does not affect the prisoners of war's right to become civilians at that time, regardless of where they are."

   Since this reply was a unilateral action that ignored the views expressed by the majority of the Commission's members, the Chairman, in a letter to the United Nations Command on January 18, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (4)), reaffirmed his position on the issue of changing the status of prisoners of war.

28. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers, in their reply on January 19, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (5)), protested the Chairman's proposal to return the custody of prisoners of war and demanded the continuation of the explanation and the Commission's continued custody of the prisoners of war.

**Chapter 4: Return of Custody of the South Camp**

29. The Indian Custodial Force began returning the custody of the South Camp prisoners of war at 08:50 on January 12, 1954, and handed over all 21,805 prisoners of war to the United Nations Command by 03:00 on January 21, 1954.

30. During the transfer of custody, 72 Chinese prisoners of war and 32 Korean prisoners of war sought protection from the Indian Custodial Force, and 92 expressed the desire to be repatriated. The Indian Custodial Force also protected 12 Chinese prisoners of war and 89 Korean prisoners of war who had escaped from their respective camps and expressed the wish to go to a neutral country. On the day of the transfer of custody, these prisoners of war refused to be handed over to the United Nations Command. Later, 15 Korean prisoners of war changed their minds and were returned to the custody of the United Nations Command on February 4, 1954. The remaining 12 Chinese prisoners of war and 74 Korean prisoners of war were sent to India with the first batch of the Indian Custodial Force leaving the demilitarized zone on February 8, 1954 (see Appendix 7 (1) for the list of these 86 prisoners of war). These prisoners of war will remain under the protection of the Indian government pending a decision on their final handling.

   Note: The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Commission believed that without conducting the explanation procedure and without the political conference studying the issue, any handling of prisoners of war is a violation of the "Scope of Authority" and the Armistice Agreement (see paragraph 25 of this report), and they believed that releasing the aforementioned prisoners of war from the Commission's custody is also a violation of the "Scope of Authority."

31. Seventeen prisoners of war accused of murder based on circumstantial evidence were detained by the Indian Custodial Force.

32. It should be noted that the prisoners of war who requested repatriation during the transfer of custody to the United Nations Command did so through their own resolute and fearless actions. The Indian Custodial Force had informed the prisoners of war of their right to repatriation. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers broadcasted to the prisoners of war on nearby mountains, informing them of their right to stay under the Commission's custody, their right to listen to explanations, and their right to be repatriated. If they were forced to leave the prisoner of war camp, they had the right to find the Indian Custodial Force to apply for repatriation. However, due to the efforts of the "representatives" of the prisoners of war (see paragraph 10 of the "Interim Report," note (1)) to prevent any prisoners of war from escaping to seek repatriation, it was extremely difficult for anyone, except the most fearless and reckless, to approach the Indian guards to seek repatriation. Therefore, the fear of the leaders and the influence of the organization were still present until the last moment. It must be reiterated that the Commission and the Indian Custodial Force had experienced this fear too many times.

   Note: On the other hand, the Swedish and Swiss members believed that even if some prisoners of war attempted to obstruct those who wished to be repatriated, the arrangements made by the Indian Custodial Force for the prisoners of war to leave the enclosure and be handed over to the United Nations Command also allowed the prisoners of war to seek repatriation or request to be sent to a neutral country. The fact that 104 prisoners of war utilized this opportunity also shows that the situation was indeed such.

33. After the Commission returned the custody of the South Camp prisoners of war, it reiterated its position on the handling and status of these prisoners of war. At the 73rd meeting held on January 21, 1954, the Commission adopted the following resolution by a majority vote:

   "The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission,

   (a) Noting that:

   (1) Most of the prisoners of war under its custody did not have the opportunity to exercise their right to repatriation and were unable to utilize the procedures for exercising their right to repatriation as stipulated in the 'Scope of Authority' and the rules formulated based on the 'Scope of Authority';

   (2) The explanation procedure, which all prisoners of war are entitled to and which the Commission is responsible for implementing, was only conducted for a small portion of all prisoners of war under the Commission's custody;

   (3) According to the 'Scope of Authority,' the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be submitted to the political conference proposed to be convened under Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement. This is a mandatory provision and cannot be replaced by any other procedure;

   (b) Noting that the Chairman and Executive of the Commission have, on January 20, 1954, returned the custody of prisoners of war who were originally under the custody of the United Nations Command and have not been directly repatriated to the United Nations Command, and have requested the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers to similarly accept the custody of prisoners of war who were originally under the custody of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers and have not been directly repatriated;

   Resolves:

   (1) To declare that any change in the status of prisoners of war who have been returned or are to be returned, whether by announcing them as civilians or by any other means, before the implementation of the explanation procedure and the political conference's discussion, is a violation of the 'Scope of Authority' and the Armistice Agreement.

   (2) To notify the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers of this resolution."

   The Swedish and Swiss members of the Commission opposed this resolution because they did not believe the Commission had the authority to make statements regarding the status of prisoners of war no longer under its jurisdiction.

   Both the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers received the Chairman's letter of January 21, 1954, and were aware of the Commission's resolution. However, the United Nations Command unilaterally and in disregard of the Commission's decision released the prisoners of war on January 23, 1954.

34. The Commission's situation left it with no other option but to reiterate the position adopted by the majority on the release of prisoners of war as civilians, hoping that the signatory parties to the "Scope of Authority" could implement the Commission's decisions, as both sides had granted the Commission the exclusive right to interpret the "Scope of Authority." As previously stated (see paragraph 23), the Commission's interpretation of Article 11 of the "Scope of Authority" excludes the release of prisoners of war or their status as civilians.

35. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers, in their letter of January 22, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (7)), strongly protested the return of the South Camp prisoners of war to the custody of the United Nations Command. The following is an excerpt from the protest:

   "We firmly oppose your return of our captured personnel who have not exercised their right to repatriation to the United Nations Command. You were fully aware that the United Nations Command was planning to unilaterally release, that is, forcibly detain, this group of our captured personnel. The facts have proven that the entire transfer process was carried out under the strict organization of the United Nations Command's threat of violence. Furthermore, our captured personnel handed over to the United Nations Command have been forcibly sent to the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan and the Lee Syngman clique in South Korea to be used as cannon fodder. Your actions have facilitated the United Nations Command's forcible detention of our captured personnel; the 'Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' has thus been completely destroyed. We firmly oppose your actions. We hereby lodge a serious protest."

36. The situation after the return of the South Camp prisoners of war to the custody of the United Nations Command was discussed at the Commission's 74th meeting on January 25, 1954. The speeches of the Commission's members are recorded in Appendix 3 (11).

**Chapter 5: Prisoners of War in the North Camp**

37. On January 21, 1954, the Chairman of the Commission again wrote to the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers (see Appendix 3 (6)) in response to the letter from Marshal Kim Il-sung and General Peng Dehuai on January 19, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (5)). Regarding the prisoners of war in the North Camp, he proposed the following:

   "I sincerely and earnestly hope that you will consider it advisable to accept the custody of the prisoners of war in the Songgul-li Prisoner of War Camp by January 22, 1954, at midnight. If the custody cannot be transferred in the manner suggested here, I will regretfully be forced to take the only option left to me, which is to withdraw the custody of the Indian Custodial Force from the Songgul-li Prisoner of War Camp."

38. The Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers, in their reply to the Chairman on January 22, 1954 (see Appendix 3 (7)), stated their position as follows:

   "We strongly oppose your proposal to return the custody of prisoners of war to the original detaining parties and demand the continuation of the explanation and the Commission's continued custody of the prisoners of war."

Title: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's Report on the Handling of Prisoners of War in Korea
Author:
Date: 1954-02-22
Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 22nd.

“……We cannot agree to the decision that the Indian custody forces will withdraw from the management of the Songgul-li POW camp after midnight on January 22, 1954. Regarding the issue of prisoners of war in the Songgul-li POW camp, we will submit it to the Military Armistice Commission and the Political Conference for resolution. Therefore, I now urgently notify you that we request the Indian custody forces to continue to be responsible for the management of the Songgul-li POW camp during their stay in Korea, so that the Military Armistice Commission and the Political Conference can handle the related issues. The issue of continuing the management of the Songgul-li POW camp should not and cannot be unilaterally resolved. Before this issue is resolved through agreement, any situation such as the abduction or escape of the prisoners currently detained in the Songgul-li POW camp will be your responsibility.”

39. Because the Chairman believed that the custody of this committee ended at midnight on January 22, 1954, and this opinion was shared by the majority of the committee members, the Indian custody forces were ordered to withdraw from custody at the designated time. The matter was handled in this way. However, the prisoners remained in the camp. The Indian custody forces then took necessary steps to protect the facilities for the prisoners in that area.

40. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers protested formally against the withdrawal of custody and demanded the restoration of custody. As for those prisoners, they said they opposed being handed over as prisoners of war and should be allowed to go through the procedures specified by the "Scope of Authority," and their future should be determined so that they could resume their civilian status.

41. On January 26, 1954, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in a letter to the Chairman of the Commission (Note: see Annex 3 (8)), stated that since the entire Indian custody forces would leave the demilitarized zone in the near future, and since the prisoners themselves had requested the Korean and Chinese sides to grant them the right to stay through the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, the Korean and Chinese sides agreed to allow the representatives of the above-mentioned Red Cross organizations to receive the 347 prisoners.

The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:

“……The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers firmly cannot agree to accept the prisoners in the northern POW camp, and at the same time, we believe that the Indian custody forces should not only not be handed over but should continue to manage these prisoners.

Now, you stated on January 23 that the Indian forces will leave Korea in two weeks. However, the United Nations Command has already refused to reach an agreement with the Korean and Chinese sides on the handling of prisoners of war at the Korean Military Armistice Commission, and the Political Conference, which should make the final decision on the prisoners of war, has not been convened due to the obstruction activities of the U.S. government. This situation puts the prisoners in the northern POW camp in a difficult position.……

In order to alleviate the difficulties of the prisoners in the northern POW camp and to reach a temporary arrangement with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the handling of the above-mentioned prisoners, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have agreed to the request of the Red Cross of Korea and China. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese sides are willing to point out that due to the failure to resolve the issue of prisoners who were not directly repatriated according to the basic objectives and steps specified in the 'Scope of Authority' of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Korean and Chinese sides must make a satisfactory explanation and resolution on this issue when the issue of prisoners of war is discussed at the Political Conference or other relevant international conferences stipulated in the armistice agreement. For this, the Korean and Chinese sides propose that the Indian forces hand over the above-mentioned 347 prisoners, along with their lists, certificates, and other items, to the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China.”

42. The Chairman of the Commission, in response to the above letter, stated in a letter to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on January 27, 1954 (Note: see Annex 3 (9)) that the Indian custody forces had withdrawn from custody at 00:01 on January 23, 1954, and therefore could not participate in any procedure for the handover of those prisoners. However, the Chairman was willing to request the Indian Red Cross representatives to hand over the lists containing the names of the prisoners and other materials to the representatives of the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. These lists were the only documents received by the Indian custody forces when they took over the management of those prisoners.

43. On January 28, 1954, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers reiterated their stance in a letter to the Chairman (Note: see Annex 3 (10)), and stated as follows:

“We will notify the Korean and Chinese Red Cross representatives to arrive at the Songgul-li camp in the northern demilitarized zone at 10:00 on January 28, 1954, to handle the handover of 347 prisoners with the Indian Red Cross.”

44. On the same day, the Indian Red Cross handed over the lists to the representatives of the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, who then took 325 South Korean prisoners, 21 American prisoners, and 1 British prisoner from the Songgul-li camp to the north. Two South Korean prisoners had previously stated that they wished to go to a neutral country rather than be handed over to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and were therefore isolated and sent to India with the first batch of Indian custody forces leaving the demilitarized zone on February 8, 1954. (Note: The names of these two prisoners are listed in Annex 7 (2)). These prisoners will be placed under the protection of the Indian government pending a final decision on their handling. (Note: see paragraph 30, second note)

Chapter 6: Verification of Prisoner Lists

45. During the execution of its administrative duties, the Indian custody forces decided to verify the list of prisoners in the South Camp. Therefore, it was decided to bring the prisoners from their tents to the area between the inner and outer barbed wire fences for verification. The "representatives" of the Chinese prisoners agreed to this procedure, but the "representatives" of the Korean prisoners could not decide and requested time to consider.

46. The first verification of the list was carried out on December 31, 1953, in the Yi-zi enclosure for Chinese prisoners. During the process, 131 prisoners expressed their wish to be repatriated. The Indian custody forces' usual administrative work was misunderstood by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, who protested against it. This protest was conveyed to the Chairman in a letter from General Li Xiangchao on December 31, 1953 (Note: see Annex 4 (1)). The following is an excerpt from the letter:

“We believe that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custody forces do not want to harm their neutral position. We firmly oppose any screening of prisoners or actions. We believe that a truly neutral country, at the very least, should not do anything that can legalize the U.S. side's plot to detain prisoners. We hope that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian custody forces will seriously consider our views.”

47. The Chairman of the Commission, in a letter to General Li Xiangchao on January 2, 1954 (see also Annex 4 (2) for General Li Xiangchao's letter of January 4, 1954), explained the true nature and intention of the work carried out by the Indian custody forces:

“On December 31, 1953, the commander of the Indian custody forces informed me that during the verification of the list of prisoners in the Yi-zi enclosure, 135 (Note: out of the 135 prisoners, 4 prisoners later changed their minds, so actually 131 were repatriated) Chinese prisoners took the opportunity to express their wish to be repatriated, which may have been due to the presence of more than the usual number of custody forces, making them feel safe. You will remember that during the investigation of the alleged Zhang Zilong murder case on November 2, several prisoners had requested repatriation. In fact, on the first day of taking over the prisoners, 9 Korean prisoners sought repatriation. Therefore, it is not understandable why the repatriation of 135 prisoners could be considered 'screening' in any sense of the word.

From the testimony of some recently repatriated prisoners, it is known that the camp leaders had obviously told the prisoners that after December 23, no one could seek repatriation. The commander of the Indian custody forces felt it necessary to dispel this mistaken impression. Therefore, he arranged for a broadcast to the prisoners, saying that those who wished to be repatriated still had the right to do so. This may have encouraged some prisoners to seek repatriation on December 31.

I wish to clearly and emphatically state that, based on the direct experience of the past four months, in my opinion, the fact that hundreds of prisoners sought repatriation in this special way in no way changes the facts described in the report of this Commission. These facts remain unchanged. The prisoner organization still exists, and its coercive nature and harmful influence also remain.”

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in General Li Xiangchao's letter of January 4, 1954 (Note: see Annex 4 (2)), responded to the Chairman's letter, noting the Chairman's assurance that the "verification of the list was not any form of screening" (Note: The original text of General Li Xiangchao's letter reads, "In your letter, you stated that the work carried out by the Indian custody forces in the Yi-zi enclosure on December 31, 1953, was the verification of the list and not any form of 'screening'") and that the "Indian custody forces would not arbitrarily replace the 'Scope of Authority' with the so-called 'screening' procedure."

48. The Commission also learned of the strong opposition from the authorities of the Republic of Korea to the verification of the prisoner lists.

49. When the Indian custody forces tried to resume the verification of the lists, they encountered opposition not only from the "representatives" of the Korean prisoners but also from the "representatives" of the Chinese prisoners. The "representatives" of the Chinese prisoners tried to explain that their change of attitude was due to their sense of unity with the Korean prisoners. The attitude of the prisoner "representatives" once again made it difficult for the Indian custody forces to carry out ordinary administrative duties. Indeed, the "representatives" of the Chinese prisoners had requested the return of those who had sought repatriation on December 31, 1953.

Chapter 7: Judicial Procedures

50. The Commission had mentioned in its "Interim Report" (Note: see "Interim Report" paragraph 93 and Annex 19) several murder cases committed by prisoners of war. All these murders occurred because the victims either wanted to be repatriated or were suspected of wanting to be repatriated. The Indian custody forces organized courts of inquiry for all nine known cases and prosecuted those cases where there was evidence to implicate certain prisoners.

51. On October 3, 1953, a brutal murder case was reported in the second camp of the Ding-zi enclosure, where a Chinese prisoner named Zhang Zilong was killed. An inquiry committee was formed. The committee concluded that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to implicate seven prisoners in the second camp of the Ding-zi enclosure. The defendants were prosecuted, and the commander of the Indian custody forces convened a military court on December 12, 1953.

52. The defendants, in accordance with Article 105 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, expressed their choice of defense counsel and requested that their wishes be communicated to the United Nations Command. The United Nations Command then proposed the names of two American lawyers. The majority of the Commission members believed that Article 105 of the Geneva Convention gave the defendants full freedom to choose their defense counsel, and therefore the lawyers provided by the United Nations Command should be accepted. (Note) The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers protested the hiring of defense counsel, insisting that only one Indian lawyer should be appointed, and said that unless the lawyer was changed, they would not cooperate in the military court trial. They stated that the hiring of defense counsel provided by the United Nations Command was not in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the "Scope of Authority," and would mean an extension of the control of the previous detaining side over the prisoners, which was unacceptable. They therefore refused to submit witnesses from the prosecution side, who had testified before the inquiry committee and were subsequently repatriated. The correspondence between the Chairman of the Commission and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on this matter is recorded in Annex 5. Under these circumstances, the military court could not be held. Subsequently, the military court had to be dissolved to form a new military court to try several Korean prisoners in the Wu-zi enclosure, Camp 38, who were accused of murdering four of their fellow prisoners who wanted to be repatriated.

Note: The Czech and Polish members of the Commission opposed the defense counsel provided by the United Nations Command for the defendants, as it was politically, morally, and legally unacceptable. They believed that the United Nations Command had no right to provide lawyers for prisoners not under its custody, and that in the absence of the defendants' choice, only the lawyers chosen by the authorities currently in custody of the prisoners were permissible under the Geneva Convention.

53. Since the witnesses from both the prosecution and the defense were under the custody of the Commission, the new military court trial began on January 6, 1954, and continued until January 19, 1954. On January 20, 1954, when the custody of the South Camp prisoners was handed over, the defense counsel stated that they could not attend the trial. The United Nations Command stated that it would not allow personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers (such as interpreters) to enter the Indian custody area in the South Camp, where the military court was being held. Faced with this situation, the military court could not proceed on January 20 and 21, 1954, and had to be suspended.

54. The military court reconvened on January 22, 1954. At the usual time of the military court on January 23, 1954, neither the defense counsel nor the defense witnesses were present. Regarding this, it can be explained that before the handover of the custody of the South Camp prisoners, the following letter was sent to the United Nations Command on January 19, 1954:

“These prisoners are important defense witnesses in the ongoing trial of three Korean prisoners. These people should be handed over to you on January 20. The detailed materials are listed in the attached list.

We request you, if the military court needs them to attend, to arrange for these prisoners to attend until the military court trial process is completed.”

55. The United Nations Command replied in a letter on January 20, 1954 (Note: see Annex 6 (1)), stating as follows:

“Therefore, the United Nations Command is convinced and must strongly insist that the Indian custody forces of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have no other legal means except to release the relevant Korean suspects by no later than 00:01 on January 23. The United Nations Command suggests that the trial records and any other materials and suggestions be handed over at this time for further appropriate action.

Regarding the witnesses listed in the annex to the above letter, it is hereby notified that the relevant personnel will not be considered to be under the custody of the United Nations Command, and they will resume their civilian status.”

56. The Commission, in a letter to the United Nations Command on January 22, 1954 (Note), expressed its attitude. The following is an excerpt from the letter:

“When the prisoners of the Dongchangli POW camp were handed over to the United Nations Command on January 20, 1954, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had, in accordance with Article 119 of the Geneva Convention, detained prisoners of war who were accused of murder and whose criminal trials had either begun or were about to begin. The intention of the Chief of Staff on January 19, 1954, in the letter '36-125' to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, was included.……

Therefore, it is proposed to continue the trials that have already begun and to start trials for other prisoners who have been preliminarily determined to have committed murder based on circumstantial evidence. I therefore must request you to provide witnesses for the trial of the above cases (or each case) and to cooperate with the Commission to ensure the speedy execution of justice.” Note: see Annex 6 (2). The Swiss member disagreed with this letter, stating that the accused prisoners should be handed over to the United Nations Command because the custody of all prisoners, including the right to try them, had ended.

57. Since no reply had been received from the United Nations Command by January 27, 1954, the Commission sent another letter (Note: see Annex 5 (5)) to the United Nations Command on that day, pointing out that as long as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission existed, it had the right and duty to enforce its laws and regulations, especially to implement the humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Convention, and emphasized that punishing those who committed crimes was one of the humanitarian provisions contained in Article 119 of the Convention.

58. The Commission particularly emphasized the following aspects of this issue:

“The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot participate in the release of any prisoners who have been established as having committed murder based on circumstantial evidence. Such a release would be a complete denial of justice. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot help create such a precedent with serious consequences.”

And “The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot abandon its responsibility, and therefore, for the sake of justice, it must seek cooperation from the United Nations Command. Therefore, if such cooperation is refused, it will be a regrettable matter for the Commission. Therefore, the Commission sincerely hopes that the United Nations Command, after re-considering this matter, will be able to provide cooperation, send witnesses, and allow defense counsel to attend the court.”

59. The United Nations Command, in its reply to the Commission's letter of January 27, 1954, on January 30, 1954 (Note: see Annex 5 (6)), reiterated its position on the release of prisoners under its custody. It said that the prisoners had been allowed to go to the country of their choice, and therefore, the United Nations Command could not provide witnesses for the trial. The letter concluded as follows:

“Whenever necessary, we, like you, are also willing to ensure the execution of justice. We reiterate our proposal that we are willing to accept the relevant personnel and any records and suggestions you wish to submit, so that they can be promptly transferred to the relevant governments.”

60. On February 1, 1954, the Chairman of the Commission again appealed to the United Nations Command (Note: see Annex 5 (7)). The relevant part of the Chairman's letter reads as follows:

“Therefore, the Commission hopes that you, after further consideration, will cooperate and send witnesses and allow defense counsel to attend the court. The Commission is eager to complete these trials before its dissolution date. If the witnesses listed by the defense as prisoners have been released, arrangements can still be made to bring them to the court. Because these prisoners have been handed over to the United Nations Command for custody and the responsibility for sending out these prisoners lies with the United Nations Command, I request that arrangements be made as soon as possible to send them out.”

61. The United Nations Command, in its reply on February 3, 1954 (Note: see Annex 5 (8)), still insisted on its position in its letter of January 30, 1954.

62. On February 16, 1954, due to the approaching dissolution of the Commission and the continued refusal of the United Nations Command to comply with the Commission's request to send out the defendants' indicated defense witnesses and to allow defense counsel to attend the court, the Chairman of the Commission notified the United Nations Command that the only course of action he could take was to hand over the accused prisoners along with the case records to your custody at 10:00 on February 18, 1954. The relevant part of the Chairman's letter reads as follows (Note: see Annex 5 (10)):

“If these prisoners are handled in any way without completing the proper legal procedures, it will be equivalent to pardoning the said crimes.

As the Chairman and executor of the Commission and as the representative of India in the Commission, I must protest against your command's refusal to cooperate in upholding the principle of justice.

Because the Commission is about to end and because the Commission cannot try the accused prisoners, the Commission has no choice but to comply with your position after protesting. At the same time, I must continue to hope that you will, for the sake of justice, not take any steps that will undermine justice and allow criminals to escape punishment. I must also point out that this responsibility lies with the United Nations Command and not with any other authority.

It is under these circumstances that I will hand over these 17 prisoners along with the relevant records to your custody at 10:00 on February 18.”

63. On February 16, 1954, the Chairman also sent a letter to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers (Note: see Annex 5 (11)), informing them of the situation regarding the handover of the prisoners. Previously, on February 13, 1954 (Note: see Annex 5 (9)), the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers had protested against the proposed action. After receiving the Chairman's letter of February 16, 1954, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in a letter on February 17, 1954 (Note: see Annex 5 (13)), again protested against the handover of the prisoners. They considered the handover of the prisoners to be a violation of the "Scope of Authority" and the Geneva Convention.

64. The Commission discussed the Chairman's letters to both sides at its 78th meeting. The Czech and Polish members spoke (Note: see Annex 5 (12)) and opposed the handover of the accused prisoners to the United Nations Command. They believed that this step, like the previous handover of 21,805 prisoners to the original detaining side, was an illegal act, contrary to the "Scope of Authority" and the armistice agreement. They believed that the United Nations Command was behind the prisoner organizations that committed the said crimes. Therefore, handing over the accused prisoners to the side that had shown its unwillingness to cooperate in the execution of justice, from political, legal, and moral points of view, was unacceptable.

65. The Swedish member, in his statement on January 27, 1954, expressed his attitude. According to this statement, he believed that as long as the Commission existed, it had the responsibility to continue the trials as much as possible. Given the situation of the Commission itself, that is, the lack of defense counsel and witnesses that made it impossible to continue the trials, and given that the Commission was about to dissolve, he believed that there was no other way except the unilateral action that the Chairman was about to take, that is, handing over the prisoners to the United Nations Command and hoping that it would take the necessary steps to complete the trials and punish the criminals according to law.

66. According to the opinion of the Swiss member, the defendants should have been handed over to the United Nations Command on January 22, 1954, along with suggestions on what further steps should be taken. This was the only step the Commission could take, because in his opinion, the custody of the prisoners had ended, and after this date, the trial could not continue due to lack of jurisdiction. Moreover, even if the trial was completed, there was no guarantee that any judgment passed by the court could be executed due to the time factor.

67. The 17 accused prisoners and the case records were handed over to the United Nations Command at 10:00 on February 18, 1954. Among the prisoners handed over in this way, there were three defendants whose actual trial had begun but was suspended on January 20, 1954 (Note: see paragraph 53), and preliminary investigations had established circumstantial evidence of murder cases for the other 14 defendants.

Chapter 8: Medical Support for Prisoners

68. Because India could not meet the demands for personnel and equipment in the prisoner hospitals, the Chairman, before the establishment of the Commission, had requested both sides to provide hospital accommodations and equipment for the prisoners they managed in the demilitarized zone on both sides of the military demarcation line in accordance with the "Scope of Authority" Article 17. However, India could provide all the personnel for the health examination rooms in the prisoner camps. This issue was discussed at the Commission's meetings on September 9 and 11, 1953, and the Commission agreed to request the original detaining sides to provide medical equipment for the prisoners they handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Chairman therefore wrote to both sides on September 13, 1953, saying that if both sides could provide the assistance requested by the Commission, he would be grateful.

69. The United Nations Command stated that it could agree if neither side brought its personnel or equipment into the hospital managed by the other side's personnel. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers also agreed, but said that to prevent the prisoners from being influenced by the original detaining side, the hospital equipment and personnel should be placed far away from the ordinary prisoners. The personnel moved in around September 17, 1953.

70. When the Commission discussed the request of the commander of the Indian custody forces to retain some of the main service personnel provided by the United Nations Command in the South Camp on September 26, 1953, the Polish representative felt that there were too many personnel in the South Camp hospital and requested arrangements to be made for a visit to the hospital. The Chairman agreed and made arrangements for the doctors attached to each delegation to visit the hospital from October 1 to October 1, 1953. During the visit, the prisoners in the hospital and the nearby camps staged demonstrations. The Indian custody forces were forced to open fire on the nearby Camp 43 of the Gang-zi enclosure, resulting in several casualties. Later, the attached institutions' members were unwilling to risk entering the hospital, so the visit had to be stopped, and the group was therefore unable to visit the entire hospital.

71. After the visit, the Polish medical officer submitted a report on the hospital, which was submitted to the Commission by the Polish member on October 6, 1953. The report requested arrangements to be made for a thorough investigation of the hospital and said that there was evidence that the hospital was the center of an organization between the prisoner camps. The number of beds set up in the hospital was too many, and the ratio of administrative personnel to medical personnel was also too high. The Commission agreed to arrange another visit to the hospital when the prisoners were a bit calmer.

72. On October 8, 1953, the deputy director of the medical department of the Indian custody forces submitted a report based on the speech of the Polish doctor. He said that if the poor living conditions of the prisoners and the fact that the long-term sick patients handed over by the United Nations Command were about 1,000 were taken into account, the number of beds set up was not too many. He did not feel that the administrative personnel or medical personnel were too many. That number and the number required for a normal Indian army hospital with 2,000 beds were similar.

73. On November 21, 1953, the Commission discussed this report at its meeting. The Polish member said that his medical officer had studied the report of the Indian custody forces and still maintained his previous opinion. The fact that the hospital was used to influence the prisoners and that the hospital played a central role in the terrorist organization in the prisoner camps seemed undeniable. Therefore, it was necessary to designate an attached institution to conduct a thorough investigation of the hospital. The Czech member supported his opinion. The Swiss and Swedish members, although they believed that according to the international standards of field hospitals, the beds and medical administrative work in the hospital were not too many, still agreed that if there was any political activity in the hospital, it should be stopped. The Commission decided to organize an attached institution to study the work of the hospital.

74. The deputy director of the medical department of the Indian custody forces replied to the accusations of the Polish member on November 27, 1953, and again explained that the hospital was arranged to deal with all unexpected events. The commander of the Indian custody forces submitted an individual report, (Note: see "Interim Report" Annex 17 (C)) stating that it seemed undeniable that the hospital was being used as a center to organize prisoners, convey messages, and communicate with people outside the demilitarized zone, and that some of the hospital personnel were involved.

Chapter 9: Conclusion

75. The Commission believes that it is unnecessary to repeat the conclusions it has already reached and stated in its "Interim Report," (Note: The conclusions of the Swiss and Swedish members are recorded in the "Individual Reports" of Switzerland and Sweden attached to the "Interim Report" of the Commission.) which have not been harmed by any matter described in the "Final Report," but have been further confirmed. The trial process of the military court and the testimony of witnesses from both the prosecution and the defense clearly and unequivocally demonstrate the existence of the prisoner organization (Note: see "Interim Report" Part 4 Chapter 1) and expose the basic nature and purpose of the prisoner organization.

76. The prisoner organization in the South Camp and the leaders who presided over these organizations denied all assumptions or claims about free choice. In the "Interim Report" of the Commission (paragraph 11), it has been stated that "any prisoner who wishes to be repatriated must secretly risk his life" or be protected by the Indian custody forces. The Commission must frankly state its belief based on its own experience that to believe that these prisoners have voluntarily chosen not to be repatriated without more fully and further implementing the "Scope of Authority" is a baseless claim without any evidence to support it.

77. The Commission must also declare: when the contracting parties solemnly signed the agreement on the "Scope of Authority," they gave the Commission the sole right to interpret the "Scope of Authority." In exercising this right, the Commission has decided that the legal prerequisite for declaring the release of prisoners of war to become civilians does not exist, and therefore such "release" is illegal.

78. The Swedish and Swiss members have detailed their different opinions on the main issues mentioned in paragraphs 76 and 77 in the appendix to this report.

Chapter 10: Dissolution of the Commission

79. At the 79th meeting of the Commission held on February 18, 1954, the Commission passed by a majority vote the resolution proposed by the Indian delegation on the dissolution of the Commission:

“The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission

Considering that the 'Scope of Authority' Article 11 stipulates a time limit, and that the Commission cannot continue to work after this time limit,

Resolves that the Commission will announce its dissolution at 24:00 on February 21, 1954.”

The Czech and Polish members believed that this resolution was illegal and protested against it.

The speeches of the members on the draft resolution and the protest of the Czech and Polish members are recorded in Annex 8.

The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers protested against this decision of the Commission on February 20, 1954. (Note: see Annex 9)

Appendix

Different Conclusions of the Swedish and Swiss Members

The Swedish and Swiss members of the Commission do not agree with the conclusions contained in paragraphs 76 and 77 of this report. They acknowledge the existence of a strong prisoner organization in the prisoner camps, but believe that during the entire custody period of the Commission, especially when the prisoners were handed over to the original detaining side, the prisoners still had the opportunity to apply for repatriation. The fact that a considerable number of prisoners (726) were actually repatriated or applied to be sent to a neutral country during the custody period proves this point.

The Swedish and Swiss members agree that the interpretation of the "Scope of Authority" belongs to the Commission. They also acknowledge that the Commission has decided by a majority vote to interpret the relevant provisions of the "Scope of Authority" in such a way that the conditions for declaring the release of prisoners of war to become civilians have not been fulfilled. However, they believe that this interpretation is not correct and is contrary to the text and spirit of the "Scope of Authority." They believe that the "Scope of Authority" Article 11 clearly assigns the Commission the responsibility to declare the release of prisoners of war to become civilians upon the expiration of 120 days after the start of custody, and that other conditions are of no significance.

    中立国遣返委员会最后报告
   【新华社开城讯】中立国遣返委员会在二月二十日发表了“中立国遣返委员会最后报告”，报告的全文如下：
      序言
    一、本委员会之“临时报告”已于一九五三年十二月二十八日送交联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面。“临时报告”论述本委员会自一九五三年九月九日至一九五三年十二月二十三日的活动，因此包括了本委员会最重要的一部分工作，即战俘看管之承当与解释工作之进行。
    二、“最后报告”所论述的事件都发生于“临时报告”所述事件之后，因而与“临时报告”同为综述本委员会解散以前的所有活动。所以“最后报告”并不是替代“临时报告”，而是补充“临时报告”的。
    第一章  解释的终止
    一、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面于一九五三年十二月二十三日为了执行“解释和访问工作细则”第二十三款的规定，于一九五三年十二月二十四日将进行解释的计划送达本委员会秘书处。该方要求自乙字第四号营场（注：见“临时报告”第八十一段）带出其余未经解释的战俘以听取解释。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军于一九五三年十二月二十三日致函本委员会主席（注：见附件一（一）。）陈述其意见如下：
    “解释工作开始后已连续停顿达五次之多，其原因是由于特务拒绝使战俘听取解释和由于委员会预期特务将会如此而断然通知我方停止解释。这样又使我方总共损失了六十个解释日期。五次停顿之中除第一、第三两次因我方迅速让步而仅仅损失了两天以外，其他各次均因委员会基本上采取了坐视态度而陷于长期停顿。在第四、第五两次停顿中，尽管委员会根据‘职权范围’和‘工作细则’有无可逃避的责任提供隔离安排来使我方解释工作得以恢复，尽管阁下在十一月六日曾经许诺提供隔离帐篷，尽管我方曾多次改变解释营场以便委员会易于带出战俘来听取解释，但委员会对于这一切都丝毫不予重视，甚至在十二月十日终于提供了隔离帐篷之后，委员会仍然强调特务不许战俘隔离，使我方解释工作无从进行。但是由于我方的据理力争，十二月二十一日战俘终被隔离，解释工作因之恢复，所谓由于特务拒绝隔离和听取解释因之委员会不能有所行动的说法已证明不是事实。正相反，以十二月二十一日情况来看，如果委员会根据‘职权范围’的规定，坚决制止特务的阻挠活动，则我方解释日期原是可以不致遭受损失的。由此可见，我方解释日期所受的重大损失虽然应由联合国军方面负其主要责任，但委员会由于未能坚决实施‘职权范围’而引致了这个损失，也是不能不负有直接责任的。
    现在，我方解释工作到十二月二十三日为止仅仅进行了十天。我方坚决要求解释工作必须继续进行直至补足了九十天的解释期限为止。我们认为中立国遣返委员会应该满足我方这个合理的要求。”
    二、本委员会在其一九五三年十二月二十三日第六十五次会议上考虑了朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面为继续解释所提出的要求。本委员会各委员的看法即于以下几段予以叙述。
    三、本委员会捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员说“职权范围”是一个整体；只有本委员会有解释权利；对每一款的解释必须与其他各款的解释一致；据以终止解释的第十一款是与“职权范围”第八款有关的；“职权范围”第八款规定有九十天的解释期限；因此“第八款中所规定的代表们对战俘的接触”是指九十天解释的接触；由于解释只进行了十天，所以解释必须予以继续，以补满十足的期限；且只有继续解释，本委员会才能实现“职权范围”关键所系的第八款。
    四、捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员回忆说，九十天解释期限的决定是交战双方经过长期谈判后所得到的折衷办法；交战一方曾提议六个月的解释期限，而交战另一方则力求将解释期限约束为三十天或六十天。“职权范围”规定的九十天期限是一个折衷的结果。把一九五三年十二月二十三日定为解释终止的日期而不保证十足九十天的解释期限，是一种武断。
    五、瑞典委员说“职权范围”第八款的意义已无可置疑；第八款明白规定战俘解释工作应“在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天（期）内”予以完成。本委员会既于一九五三年九月二十四日接管，解释工作应于一九五三年十二月二十三日结束。因此，捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员对该款的解释并不符合该款内容。而且“职权范围”第十一款明白指出有关一方的解释代表与被俘人员的接触应于战俘交由本委员会看管之日起的九十天期满后予以终止。对于波兰委员所主张采用的补偿原则，瑞典委员声称由于本委员会已同意一九五三年九月二十四日所致双方函件，本委员会已承认九十天期限为确定不移，同时亦已承认本委员会无权更动该项期限。“职权范围”第十一款之唯一目的在于防止无限期看管战俘，而停战谈判记录中并无任何记载可以支持相反的意见。他因此主张双方既未协议延长解释期限，本委员会即应按照“职权范围”之现有文字予以实施并确守其中所规定的时间表。
    六、瑞士委员说“职权范围”第八款并未说
  “在”九十天期间，而是说“在”九十天“内”；这就是说解释工作应在该期限内结束，而在该期限以后，解释代表即不再与战俘接触。补偿原则在军事停战委员会中已有讨论，但并未在此一基础上达成协议。本委员会无权更动“职权范围”为解释工作所规定的期限。
    七、印度代表团认为，此中包括两个不同的问题：第一、从“职权范围”的目的来考虑，有没有必要延长解释期限；第二、本委员会是否有权允许这一延长。印度代表团虽然赞成延长解释期限，但认为只有经过联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军双方之间的协议，延长方能实行；本委员会一九五三年九月二十四日与二十八日致双方的函件
  （见“临时报告”第三十六、三十七段与附件九），是假定本委员会本身无权允许解释期限的延长的；而第十一款明白规定：“战俘的看管移交……九十天期满后，……代表们……的接触应即终止……”。看管移交的日期既固定不移，接触终止的日期自然也固定不移。唯有双方协议，日期的顺延和解释的延长才有可能。
    八、本委员会对终止解释工作这一问题的最后决定已由主席在其一九五三年十二月二十四日信中
  （注：见附件一（二））通知朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面。此信于一九五三年十二月二十四日本委员会第六十六次会议上以多数票获得通过，捷克斯洛伐克委员与波兰委员投票反对。以下为此信的有关摘录：
      “……本委员会没有权力允许你方解释代表接触以便他们能按照‘职权范围’第八款进行解释。只有停战协定那些签字国达成了协议，才能获得任何接触时间的顺延。”
    九、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面抗议本委员会此一决定。此项抗议是李相朝将军在其一九五三年十二月二十七日致主席函中（注：见附件一
  （三））提出的。以下为该函的有关摘录：
    “‘职权范围’的各项规定是一个互相关联的整体，是不容加以任何割裂的。‘职权范围’保证九十天的解释以使全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利的基本精神，与‘职权范围’第八款对此的具体规定，是‘职权范围’第十一款的不可缺少的前提。由于美方蓄意拖延解释设备的修建，指使特务不准战俘听取解释，抗拒隔离战俘的规定，而中立国遣返委员会则始终未采取有效措施打破特务对战俘的控制，保证解释工作的必要条件，朝中方面的解释工作既未能按期开始，又未能不间断地进行。
    到十二月二十三日为止的九十天的期间，朝中方面仅能进行了十天的解释工作，已听取解释的战俘不及全部战俘的百分之十五。‘职权范围’第十一款的前提因而已被破坏无遗。但中立国遣返委员会不但没有采取必要措施保证九十天的解释工作，却反而在解释工作在朝中方面的努力下方才恢复三天后，借口‘职权范围’第十一款的规定是所谓强制性的，无理宣布解释工作的终止。这是完全不顾事实，任意割裂条文，绝对不能令人信服的。难道
  ‘职权范围’第十一款以外的其他条款，特别是第八款，是没有强制性的吗？难道中立国遣返委员会只有权推迟解释工作达二十天之久，只有权坐视美方及其所布置的特务屡次中断解释工作达六十天之久，只有权坐视百分之八十五以上的将近两万名的我方被俘人员根本不能听取解释，却无权按照‘职权范围’第八款的规定保证九十整天的解释工作吗？中立国遣返委员会多数委员终止解释工作的这个决定显然是与中立国主持公道的公正立场不相容的。”
    第二章  “职权范围”第十一款的解释
    十、本委员会在以多数票决定了规定的解释期限业已终止并只有经双方协议才能予以延长之后，就着手确定处理战俘所应采取的进一步措施。主席在其一九五三年十二月二十八日将本委员会多数通过的“临时报告”提交双方时所附之信件中，以下列说法将问题提出：
      “我以本委员会的主席和执行人的资格，愿意表达一个为本委员会所有其他委员所共有的希望，即希望贵方对战俘的处理问题以符合于‘职权范围’中所体现的基本目标的态度予以认真的考虑。”
    十一、“临时报告”第一百零四段曾提请双方注意本委员会所面对的具体问题：
      “按‘职权范围’第十一款，本委员会负有一项义务，即‘九十天期满后……未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题，应交由停战协定草案第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议……’。这样的一个政治会议还没有实现。因此本委员会不能将他们的处理问题提交政治会议，故不得不将整个问题提交双方依照本委员会的报告加以考虑。同时‘职权范围’第十一款应以何种方式予以实施也应考虑，特别是有关宣布‘任何战俘，凡在中立国遣返委员会负责看管他们后的一百二十天内尚未行使其被遣返权利，又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法者……解除他们的战俘身分使之成为平民’的问题。（注：请查阅‘临时报告’第一零四段脚注本委员会捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员所作的保留。）”
    十二、为了充分实施“职权范围”，包括其第十一款在内，主席曾交本委员会备忘录一则（注：见附件二（一）），说明中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队所面临之若干更为重要的问题。主席并且提出一项致联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的信稿（注：见附件二（二））以供本委员会考虑。本委员会在其一九五四年一月二日第六十八次会议上考虑了此项信稿与备忘录。
    十三、本委员会瑞士委员声称虽不反对这二个文件的目的，但反对其中的说法，认为这些说法有所矛盾而且令人误会。瑞典委员声称他也不同意该信以及该备忘录中关于解释期限、战俘看管、和解散中立国遣返委员会等项内容。
    十四、本委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员与波兰委员声称，虽然他们对于备忘录中所列各种事项已经表示了他们的具体观点，但仍以问明双方主张为宜。他们说他们支持主席将备忘录送交双方的建议。
    十五、本委员会未作任何修正即以三对零票批准了主席为提交该备忘录而致双方的信稿。瑞典与瑞士委员弃权。
    十六、联合国军对本委员会“临时报告”之意见以及对主席一九五四年一月二日信中与备忘录中所提的问题的意见，已见该方总司令赫尔将军一九五四年一月三日和六日先后致本委员会主席的两封信中（注：见附件二（三））。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的意见已于一九五四年一月七日金日成元帅与彭德怀将军的来信中（注：见附件二
  （四））通知主席。
    十七、瑞典委员于一九五四年一月十一日建议本委员会考虑他所提出的决议案草案（注：见附件二（五））。他建议本委员会应决议：
    “就战俘的处理而言，‘职权范围’第十一款应解释为：中立国遣返委员会应于一九五四年一月二十二日宣布解除尚未行使遣返权利之战俘的战俘身分使之成为平民，这是假定在上述日期之前，‘职权范围’第十一款所述的政治会议未协议其他处理办法，或由于政治会议在该日以前尚未召开或由于政治会议虽已召开而在该日以前并未作出任何其他处理的协议。”
    本委员会在其一九五四年一月十一日与十二日召开的第七十次会议上讨论过此项决议案草案。本委员会否决了瑞士委员所支持的瑞典决议案草案。
    本委员会各委员支持或反对瑞典决议案草案的发言载于附件二（六）。
    第三章  战俘的处理
    十八、在提交给联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面的“临时报告”中，本委员会已陈述了若干事实与情况，这些事实与情况曾经存在过，而且大部分曾继续存在，并且包围着本委员会对履行其有关实施“职权范围”的责任的努力。由于这些事实与情况，仅有一小部分战俘行使了被遣返的权利，而且他们是偷偷摸摸或冒着生命危险这样做的。但在本委员会看管下曾留有数目多得多的战俘未能利用“职权范围”中与根据“职权范围”而制定的“工作细则”中所规定的关于他们行使被遣返权利的程序。〔注〕
        注：瑞典与瑞士委员提及它们的附在本委
    员会“临时报告”中的“个别报告”时认为，
    虽有战俘组织之存在，但战俘在本委员会看管
    期间曾有申请遣返的机会。六百三十八名战俘
    已获遣返，而且其中一百三十六名是经过解释
    的程序的，就是这一事实的证明。
    十九、“职权范围”的基本目的为“为保证全部战俘……有机会行使其被遣返的权利”，本委员会多数委员感到对此必须作一切努力以保证进一步并更充分地实施“职权范围”的程序与宗旨。本委员会多数委员考虑到此一目的，因而同意主席致函双方及附于该函的备忘录（注：见第十二段和附件二（一）、（二））。
    二十、联合国军的答复（见第十六段及附件二
  （三））清楚说明反对继续解释。联合国军认为没有任何理由来作任何进一步的讨论以考虑未遣返的战俘的处理，联合国军并对印度看管部队于一九五四年一月二十三日零时一分以后是否有权看管战俘提出疑问。
    二十一、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面同意解释期限应予延长，解释应予恢复，及中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队应继续履行“其尚未完成的合法职务”。
    二十二、鉴于本委员会多数委员已决定（注：见第八段）解释期限只能经过双方协议才能延长，而此种协议并未达成，本委员会因而在战俘的处理问题上陷入困境。本委员会甚至未能实施第十一款强制性的规定。这一规定要求本委员会将未遣返的战俘的处理问题提交停战协定第六十款中所建议召开的政治会议。〔注〕
        注：本委员会瑞典、瑞士委员认为“职权
    范围”清楚规定，无论解释工作究竟用了多少时
    间，解释期限均应于接管后的第九十天终止。
        上述各位委员并认为只有政治会议确在接
    管后一百二十天内召开，将战俘问题提交政治
    会议的规定才能是强制性的。
    二十三、本委员会多数委员在否决瑞典的决议案草案时，表示不能把战俘释放成为平民身分。由于有了“职权范围”的第二十四款，此一立场后来成为本委员会有约束性的决定。（注：见第三十三段。）
    二十四、在第十八段到第二十三段所陈述的情况下，本委员会主席作为本委员会的执行人，并作为提供看管部队的委员国代表，乃于一九五四年一月十四日致函双方。（注：见附件三（一）、（二）。）主席建议双方将于一九五四年一月二十三日以前将战俘交还原拘留各方看管。以下为该函有关部分的摘要：
      “作为本委员会的主席与执行人，我愿以最明确的方式声明：我把战俘交还原拘留一方看管，是因为我既不能保持对战俘的看管，又不能进一步实施‘职权范围’，也不能把他们释放。我这么做并不是要对他们的身分作任何改变，或者对战俘的最后处理。
    此外，遵照本委员会解释‘职权范围’的职权，本委员会认为若用宣布成为平民身分，或者用任何其他方式的处理来改变战俘的身分，都需要在此之前实施解释工作和政治会议的步骤；这种步骤须根据上述职权（范围）的规定进行到合法的终局，除非双方关于战俘身分与处理商定其他步骤或做法。任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于‘职权范围’。
    在采取这一路径时，我是出于诚挚的愿望以推进停战协定的目的，按现时存在的情况遵守合法的、不偏不倚的程序，避免暴力的可能爆发，并依照关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约的目的与精神来行事。”
    二十五、本委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员与波兰委员反对并抗议将战俘交还原拘留各方看管。他们对于此一问题所持态度的发言载于附件三（二甲）。
    二十六、鉴于瑞典委员主张在一九五四年一月二十二日释放战俘为平民身分的提议未为本委员会所采纳，瑞典、瑞士委员虽然反对主席致双方函中的倡议、反对他片面采取行动，但基于人道主义及实际理由，认为将战俘交还原拘留各方是合理的。
    二十七、联合国军在其一九五四年一月十六日答主席一九五四年一月十四日函的复函中（注：见附件三（三））声明虽然愿意接管战俘，但也同样地决意于一九五四年一月二十三日将战俘“释放”。
    以下为该复函有关部分：
    “我重申联合国军不可更改地确信中立国遣返委员会有履行其责任并将全部已经拒绝遣返的战俘在一月二十三日零时一分释放成平民身分的庄严义务。中立国遣返委员会之不能完成这一义务将是有意逃避‘职权范围’的一个重要的要素，而联合国军不能同意一种构成中立国遣返委员会不履约的行动。
    联合国军不能同意按照你建议中的条件接管这些战俘。然而，鉴于你已经声明要从一月二十日开始片面释放战俘，联合国军只得准备好安排他们的收容和处理。必须明确了解我们在这些人员离开非军事区后加以接待是出于尊重人道主义的考虑，并且是为了保证战俘尽可能充分地继续享受协议指定应保证给他们的利益。联合国军将尊重它按照关于战俘的协议的义务，在一月二十三日把他们当作像平民一样地完全享有自由的人来对待他们。你已经知道联合国军所已经作出的详细接待计划。在一月二十三日零时一分以前将人员交还联合国军之事，只能被认为中立国遣返委员会未能充分履行其职务，但是必须强调，这绝不影响战俘有权届时成为平民，不论他们身处何地。”
    因为此一答复是无视本委员会多数委员所表示的意见的片面行动，主席就在其一九五四年一月十八日致函联合国军（注：见附件三（四））重申其对于改变战俘身分问题的立场。
  二十八、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在其一九五四年一月十九日复函中（注：见附件三
  （五））抗议主席交还战俘看管之建议，要求继续进行解释，并要求本委员会保持对战俘的看管。
    第四章  南营看管之交还
    二十九、印度看管部队于一九五四年一月十二日八时五十分开始将南营战俘的看管交还，并于一九五四年一月二十一日三时零分将二万一千八百零五名战俘全数送交联合国军看管。
    三十、在移交看管过程中，有七十二名中国籍战俘与三十二名朝鲜籍战俘寻求印度看管部队的保护，并且有九十二名希望遣返。印度看管部队还保护了先后从其各自营场中逃出来的、并表示愿去中立国的十二名中国籍战俘与八十九名朝鲜籍战俘。在移交看管之日，这些战俘断然拒绝被交给联合国军。其后有十五名朝鲜籍战俘改变主意，在一九五四年二月四日交还联合国军看管。其余十二名中国籍战俘与七十四名朝鲜籍战俘于一九五四年二月八日已随同离开非军事区的第一批印度看管部队送往印度。（注：该八十六名战俘的名单载于附件七
  （一））这些战俘将留于印度政府保护之下以待对其最后处理的决定。（注）
        注：本委员会捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员认
    为：在未实行解释程序及未由政治会议研究之
    前，对战俘进行任何处理都是违反“职权范
    围”和停战协定的（见本报告第二十五段），
    他们认为将上述战俘由本委员会之看管下释放
    出来也是违背“职权范围”的。
    三十一、依据形迹证据而成立的谋杀案的十七名战俘被告已为印度看管部队所扣留。
    三十二、兹指出在移交与联合国军看管时要求遣返的战俘，其要求遣返是由于他们自己坚决无畏的行动。印度看管部队曾把战俘遣返的权利告知了战俘。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军在邻近山上对战俘广播通知他们有权利留在本委员会看管之下，有权听取解释并被遣返；如果他们被迫离开战俘营，他们有权去找印度看管部队申请遣返。然而由于战俘“代表”（注：见临时报告第十段，注（一））很想阻止任何战俘逃脱以寻求遣返，因而设法使战俘从他们的营场中出来时，除了最无畏与不顾死活的战俘以外，任何人都极难接近印度守卫以寻求遣返。所以，对首脑的恐惧，以及组织的影响，直到最后还是存在着的。必须重新申说的是，本委员会与印度看管部队对这种恐惧的存在是经验得太多了。（注）
        注：在另一方面，瑞典与瑞士委员认为即
    使有些战俘企图阻挠那些愿意遣返的人，印度
    看管部队在战俘离开围场移交给联合国军时所
    作的安排也使战俘有可能寻求遣返或要求送往
    中立国。有一百零四名战俘利用了这一机会的
    事实也说明了情况显然是这样的。
    三十三、本委员会将南营战俘的看管交还以后，曾再次申述其对这些战俘的处理与身分问题的态度。在一九五四年一月二十一日举行的第七十三次会议上，本委员会以多数票通过了以下的决议：
      “中立国遣返委员会，
      （甲）鉴于：
      （子）它所看管的大部分战俘都没有机会行使他们的被遣返权利，未能利用‘职权范围’和根据
  ‘职权范围’拟订的规则中所规定的关于行使他们的被遣返权利的程序；
      （丑）根据‘职权范围’一切战俘都有权享受的、并责成委员会执行的解释程序，只对委员会看管下的全部战俘中的一小部分进行过；
    （寅）根据‘职权范围’，未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题应由委员会提交根据停战协定第六十款召开的政治会议，把这个问题提交政治会议是强制性的规定，不能以任何其他程序来代替；
      （乙）注意到委员会的主席和执行人已在一九五四年一月二十日把委员会看管下的、原来从联合国军看管下接收过来的不直接遣返战俘交还给联合国军看管，他并已要求朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面同样接收本委员会看管下的、原来由朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面看管的不直接遣返战俘；
    兹决议：
      （一）声明在实施解释程序和经过政治会议讨论之前，用宣布成为平民身分或用任何其他方式，来对已经交还的或准备交还的战俘的身分作任何改变，都是违反‘职权范围’和停战协定的。
    （二）把这项决议通知联合国军和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面。”
    本委员会瑞典、瑞士委员反对此一决议，因为他们不认为本委员会有权就不复归它管辖的战俘作有关其身分的声明。
    联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面都接获本委员会主席一九五四年一月二十一日函而得悉本委员会的此一决议。
    但联合国军片面地且不顾本委员会的决定，于一九五四年一月二十三日将战俘释放。
    三十四、本委员会的处境使本委员会无其他办法，而只有申述本委员会经多数决议所采取的对释放战俘为平民身分的立场，以冀“职权范围”的协议双方能够执行本委员会各项决定，而根据“职权范围”，双方已将解释“职权范围”的专有权利给与本委员会。如已说明的（注：见本报告第二十三段），本委员会对“职权范围”第十一款的解释是排除战俘的释放或使其成为平民身分的。
    三十五、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在其一九五四年一月二十二日信中（注：见附件三
  （七））强烈抗议将南营战俘交还联合国军看管。以下为该项抗议的有关摘录：
   “我们坚决反对你将未行使遣返权利的我方被俘人员交还联合国军。你在作出这一决定时完全知道联合国军是计划片面释放亦即强迫扣留这批我方被俘人员的。事实证明，整个移交过程是在联合国军严密组织起来的暴力威胁之下进行的。并且，被交还联合国军的我方被俘人员已被强迫送往台湾国民党残余匪帮和南朝鲜李承晚集团准备当炮灰。你的行动方便了联合国军强迫扣留我方被俘人员；‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’已因此而被破坏无遗。我们坚决反对你这一行动。我们向你提出严重抗议。”
    三十六、将南营战俘交还联合国军看管后的情况在一九五四年一月二十五日本委员会第七十四次会议上作了讨论。本委员会各位委员的发言载于附件三（十一）。
    第五章  北营的战俘
    三十七、一九五四年一月二十一日本委员会主席又致函（注：见附件三（六））朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面以回答金日成元帅与彭德怀将军一九五四年一月十九日函（注：见附件三（五））。关于北营的战俘，他建议如下办法：
    “……我恳切地与诚挚地希望你方将认为于一九五四年一月二十二日午夜以前接受松谷里战俘营之战俘的重新看管是属于得策，倘不能照这里所建议的方式移交看管，我将遗憾地被迫采取留给我的唯一途径，即从松谷里战俘营撤除印度看管部队的看管。”
    三十八、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在其一九五四年一月二十二日答主席函中（注：见附件三（七））说明其态度如下：
      “……我们不能同意印度看管军将在一九五四年一月二十二日午夜以后撤退对松谷里战俘营看管的你的决定。关于收容在松谷里战俘营中的战俘的问题，我们将提交军事停战委员会和政治会议解决。因此我现在紧急通知你，我们要求印度看管军在其留在朝鲜期间继续负责看管松谷里战俘，以便军事停战委员会与政治会议得以处理有关他们的问题。继续看管松谷里战俘营的问题不应亦不容许片面解决。在这个问题得到协议解决前，目前收容在松谷里战俘营中的战俘如有被劫持或跑散等情况，
  一概由你负责。”
    三十九、因为主席认为本委员会的看管于一九五四年一月二十二日午夜中止，而这一意见又为本委员会多数委员所共有，印度看管部队遂受命于指定时间撤回看管。事情就这样做了。但战俘仍然留于营场。印度看管部队于是采取必要步骤以对该区域的战俘设备给予保护。
    四十、朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面对撤回看管又提出正式抗议并要求恢复看管。至于那些战俘，他们说他们反对把他们作为战俘予以交还，应使他们能够经过“职权范围”所规定的程序，并应确定地决定他们的前途，以便他们能恢复他们的平民身份。
    四十一、一九五四年一月二十六日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在致本委员会主席函中
  （注：见附件三（八））声明，因全部印度看管部队将在短期内离开非军事区，且因战俘自己曾通过朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会要求朝中方面给予他们居留权利，朝中方面允许上述红十字会的代表接收该三百四十七名战俘。
    函中有关部分如下：
    “……朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面坚决不能同意接受看管北部战俘营中的战俘，同时，我方并认为印度看管部队不仅不应交还，并且还应继续看管这些战俘。
    现在，阁下在一月二十三日声称，印度部队将于两星期后全部离开朝鲜。但联合国军方面则已经拒绝在朝鲜军事停战委员会上与朝中方面就战俘处理问题取得协议，而应对战俘作出最后处理的政治会议又因美国政府的阻挠活动以致未能召开。这种情况使北部战俘营中的战俘处于困难境地。……
    为了解除北部战俘营中的战俘的困难，为了与中立国遣返委员会就上述战俘的处理问题取得临时安排，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面已对朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会的请求表示同意。同时，朝中方面愿意指出，由于未予直接遣返的战俘问题未能按照‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’所规定的基本目标和步骤取得解决，因此，当战俘问题在停战协定所规定的政治会议或其他有关国际会议上提出讨论时，朝鲜停战缔约双方必须就此项问题作出满意的交代和取得解决。为此，朝中方面建议印度部队将上述三百四十七名战俘连同他们的名册、证件及其他物品点交朝鲜红十字会和中国红十字会。”
    四十二、本委员会主席为答复上述一函，于一九五四年一月二十七日致函朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面（注：见附件三（九））重新说明印度看管部队已于一九五四年一月二十三日零时一分撤回其看管，因此，不能参加移交那些战俘的任何程序。但主席表示愿请印度红十字会代表将含有战俘姓名与其他材料的名单移交给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会代表。这些名单是印度看管部队在接受看管那些战俘的工作时所收到的仅有的文件。
    四十三、一九五四年一月二十八日朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在其致主席函中重申其态度（注：见附件三（十）），并声明如下：
    “我将通知朝中红十字会代表于一九五四年一月二十八日十时到达非军事区北部松谷里营场与印度红十字会办理三百四十七名战俘接交事宜。”
    四十四、同日，印度红十字会将名单移交朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的与中华人民共和国的红十字会代表，然后由他们将三百二十五名南朝鲜籍战俘，二十一名美国籍战俘与一名英国籍战俘从松谷里营场带往北方。两名南朝鲜籍战俘前此曾声明他们希望到中立国而不希望被移交给朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面，因而被隔离起来，并与第一批离开非军事区的印度看管部队一起于一九五四年二月八日送往印度。（注：这两名战俘的名单载于附件七（二））这些战俘将留置于印度政府的保护之下以待有关他们的最后处理的决定。（注：见第三十段，第二个注）
    第六章  核对战俘名单
    四十五、印度看管部队在执行其行政职司的过程中，决定核对南营战俘的名单。因此决定将战俘自其帐篷中带至里层铁丝网与外层铁丝网之间的地段中，一一与名单核对。中国籍战俘的“代表”同意此一程序，但朝鲜籍“代表”不能决定并要求时间以进行考虑。
    四十六、第一次名单之核对是一九五三年十二月三十一日在中国籍战俘乙字围场进行的。在进行过程中，一百三十一名战俘出而表示遣返愿望。印度看管部队此等通常例行的行政工作为朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面所误解，他们对此提出了抗议。此一抗议是在一九五三年十二月三十一日李相朝中将的来函中（注：见附件四（一））传达给主席的。以下为该函有关摘录：
    “我们相信中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队是不愿意损害自己的中立地位的。我们坚决反对任何甄别战俘的主张或行动。我们认为真正的中立国家最低限度不应作任何事可以使美方扣留战俘的阴谋合法化。我们希望中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队郑重考虑我们的意见。”
    四十七、本委员会主席在一九五四年一月二日致李相朝中将的复函中（关于此一问题请同时参看附件四（二）中所列的一九五四年一月四日李相朝中将的来信），说明了印度看管部队所进行的此项工作的真情与意图：
     “一九五三年十二月三十一日，印度看管部队司令官通知我，在查对乙字围场战俘的名单的过程中，一百三十五名（注：一百三十五名战俘中有四名战俘后来改变了主意，因此实际上被遣返的是一百三十一名）中国籍战俘趁机表示了他们要求遣返的愿望，这可能是由于有多于通常数目的看管部队在场使他们觉得安全有了保证。你会记得，在十一月二日对据称张子龙凶杀案的情况进行调查的过程中，若干名战俘曾要求遣返。其实在接管战俘的第一天就有九名朝鲜籍战俘寻求遣返。因此不能了解何以一百三十五名战俘的遣返能被认为是‘甄别’，无论从这个名词的任何意义上来讲。
    从一些新近遣返的战俘的证词中得知，营场首领显然曾对战俘说十二月二十三日以后任何人都不能寻求遣返。印度看管部队司令官觉得必须清除这一谬误的印象。因此，他安排了一次对战俘的广播，说那些愿意遣返的人仍然有权这样作。这件事可能鼓励了若干战俘在十二月三十一日寻求遣返。
    我愿明确而着重地说明，根据过去四个月的直接的经验，在我看来，数百余名战俘以这种特殊的方式寻求遣返一事，无论如何都不改变本委员会报告中所叙述的事实。这些事实依然如故。战俘组织依然存在，其胁迫的性质与有害的影响也依然存在。
    我相信，鉴于我以上所说的话，你会了解，在看管部队的思想上决不想以据称的‘甄别’手续来武断地代替‘职权范围’的规定。”
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在李相朝中将一九五四年一月四日的来信里（注：见附件四
  （二））答复了本委员会主席的这封信，注意到了本委员会主席的保证，这个保证是“查对名单的工作绝不是任何形式的甄别”（译注：——按我方李相朝将军去信的原文为“信中你表示一九五三年十二月三十一日印度看管部队在东场里乙号围场所进行的是查对名单的工作而绝不是任何形式的“甄别”）以及“印度看管部队绝不会以据称的甄别手续来武断地代替‘职权范围’的规定。”
    四十八、本委员会也获悉大韩民国当局对查对战俘名单的强烈反对。
    四十九、当印度看管部队努力恢复名单的查对时，不仅遭到朝鲜籍战俘“代表”的反对，且遭到中国籍战俘“代表”的反对。中国籍战俘“代表”力求说明他们态度上的改变是由于与朝鲜籍战俘之间的团结感。战俘“代表”的态度又一次使印度看管部队连在执行普通的行政职司时也遭到困难。的确，中国籍战俘“代表”曾要求归还那些在一九五三年十二月三十一日寻求遣返的战俘。
    第七章  司法处理过程
    五十、本委员会在其“临时报告”中（注：见“临时报告”第九十三段及其附件十九）曾提及战俘所犯的若干谋杀案。所有这些谋杀案之所以发生，是因为那些被害者希望遣返或被怀疑抱有此种愿望。印度看管部队对所有已知的九起案件都组织了调查庭，并对那些有可能把犯罪行为归之于某些战俘的案件提出起诉。
    五十一、一九五三年十月三日在丁字围场第二十八号营场中就发生了这样的一起据称的残暴谋杀案，当时一名叫做张子龙的中国籍战俘遭到杀害。一个调查委员会组成了。该委员会得出这样的结论：已有充分依据形迹而推定的证据证明丁字围场第二十八号营场中七名战俘的罪状。被告受到起诉，印度看管部队司令官于一九五三年十二月十二日曾召开一个军事法庭。
    五十二、被告按照有关战俘待遇的日内瓦公约第一百零五条表示了他们对辩护律师的选择，并要求将其愿望通知联合国军。联合国军因而提出了两个美国籍律师的名字。本委员会多数委员认为日内瓦公约第一百零五条给予被告完全的自由来选择辩护律师，因此联合国军提供给被告的律师应予接受。（注）朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面对聘用辩护律师一事提出了抗议，坚持只应指派一名印度律师，并说除非更换律师，他们就不在军事法庭的审判过程中予以合作。他们表示聘用联合国军所提供的辩护律师对日内瓦公约与“职权范围”均属不合，且将意味着延长了前拘留一方对战俘的控制，而这是不能容许的。他们因而不肯提交提起公诉一方的证人，这些证人在调查委员会面前已经作过证、随后就获得遣返。本委员会主席和朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面之间关于此事之来往信件载于附件五。在此种情况之下，军事法庭已无法举行。接着，军事法庭只得解散，以便能够组成新的军事法庭以审判戊字围场第三十八号营场的若干朝鲜籍战俘，这些战俘被控谋杀他们之中四名希望遣返的战俘伙伴。
    注：本委员会捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员反对由联合国军方面提供的律师替被告进行辩护，因为在政治上、在道义上和在法律上都是不能许可的。他们认为联合国军方面无权提供律师替不在其看管下的战俘进行辩护，并认为在被告自己无有选择时，按照日内瓦公约只有正在看管战俘的当局所选择的律师才是许可的。
    五十三、由于提起公诉一方及辩护一方的证人均在本委员会看管之下，新军事法庭的审判于一九五四年一月六日开始，并一直继续到一九五四年一月十九日。一九五四年一月二十日移交南营战俘的看管责任时，辩护律师表示在审判过程中不能到场。联合国军表示不允许朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的人员（例如译员）进入南营印度看管部队地区，而当时军事法庭是正在南营举行的。面临此种情况，军事法庭在一九五四年一月二十日与二十一日已无法进行工作而只得停开。
    五十四、军事法庭于一九五四年一月二十二日复会。在军事法庭于一九五四年一月二十三日通常时间召开时，辩护律师与辩护证人皆未出席。关于这一点可以说明，在移交南营战俘的看管责任之前，曾把以下函件于一九五四年一月十九日送交联合国军：
    “这些战俘乃是现在正在进行的三名朝鲜籍战俘审判中的重要辩护证人。这些人应于一月二十日移交给你们。其详细材料见后附清单。
    兹要求你们，如果军事法庭需要他们出席，一直到军事法庭的审判过程结束时为止，请你们保证安排让这些战俘出席。”
    五十五、联合国军在一九五四年一月二十日来函作答（注：见附件六（一）），其中声明如下：
    “因此，联合国军确信并必须强烈地坚持：中立国遣返委员会印度看管部队除了不迟于一月二十三日零时一分释放朝鲜籍有关嫌疑犯之外没有其他合法的办法。联合国军建议把迄今为止的审判记录以及任何其他材料和建议在此时移交给联合国军，以进行进一步的适当措施。
    至于上述尊函附件所列的证人，兹通知你：有关人员将不被认为是在联合国军看管之下，他们将复归为平民身份。”
    五十六、本委员会于一九五四年一月二十二日致函联合国军（注）表明自己的态度。以下为该函有关摘录：
   “在一九五四年一月二十日将东场里战俘营战俘移交给联合国军看管时，……中立国遣返委员会已按照日内瓦公约第一百十九条扣留了被控犯谋杀罪而其刑事审判即将进行或已实际开始的战俘。主席的参谋长一九五四年一月十九日给你的中立国遣返委员会‘三六’一二五号信中已包含此意图在内。……
    因此特建议继续已经开始的审判，并对其他案情已依据形迹上的证据而告推定的战俘开始审判。我因此须要求你为了进行对上述案件（或各案件）的审判，提供证人，并与本委员会合作以保证司法的迅速执行。”注：见附件六（二）。瑞士委员不同意这封信，表示被控告的战俘应送交联合国军，因为全部战俘的看管责任包括裁判权在内已经终止。
    五十七、由于到一九五四年一月二十七日还没有接到联合国军的答复，本委员会乃于该日另函
  （注：见附件五（五））联合国军，指出只要中立国遣返委员会存在，中立国遣返委员会便有权利与义务贯彻其法令与规章，特别是实施日内瓦公约人道主义的规定，并强调惩处那些犯罪者是该公约第一百十九条内所包含的一个此类人道主义的规定。
    五十八、本委员会特别强调此项问题的下述方面：
   “中立国遣返委员会不能参加释放任何已确立犯有依据形迹证据而推定的谋杀案件的战俘。这种释放等于完全否定司法。中立国遣返委员会不能帮助创造这种充满着严重后果的先例。”
    以及“中立国遣返委员会不可能放弃其责任，因此为了司法的利益，它必须寻求联合国军的合作。所以，假使拒绝予以这种合作，对本委员会说来，那将是一件遗憾的事。因此，本委员会恳切地希望联合国军在重新考虑这问题以后，将能予以合作，派遣证人并允许辩护律师出席法庭。”
    五十九、联合国军在一九五四年一月三十日答复本委员会一九五四年一月二十七日一函（注：见附件五（六））重申它在释放交还其看管的战俘问题上的态度。它说战俘已获准前往其选择的国家，因此，联合国军不能为审判提供证人。该函结尾如下：
      “只要有所需要，我们和你一样也愿保证司法的执行。我们重申我们的提议，即我们愿接受有关人员以及你所愿意提出的记录和建议，以便迅速转交有关各政府。”
    六十、一九五四年二月一日本委员会主席又向联合国军呼吁（注：见附件五（七））。主席去信的有关部分如下：
    “因此，本委员会希望，你在进一步考虑后能给与合作而派遣证人并允许辩护律师出席法庭。本委员会渴望在其解散日期之前完成这些审判。假如辩护人所列举作为证人的战俘已经释放，仍然可以作出安排把他们带到法庭来。因为这些战俘已交给联合国军看管而送出这些战俘的责任是属于联合国军的，我请求能为了送出他们而早日作出安排。”
    六十一、联合国军在其一九五四年二月三日复函中（注：见附件五（八））仍然坚持其一九五四年一月三十日来函中的态度。
    六十二、一九五四年二月十六日，由于本委员会解散之期日渐迫近，而联合国军仍然不愿依从本委员会的要求派出被告所指出的辩护一方的证人，也不愿准许辩护律师出席法庭，本委员会主席于是通知联合国军说他所能采取的唯一办法就是将被控的战俘随同案件记录于一九五四年二月十八日十时交由该方看管。主席去函的有关部分如下（注：见附件五（十））：
     “若不完成正当的法律程序而对这些战俘作任何处理，将等于宽赦所说的罪行。
    作为委员会的主席和执行人以及作为印度参加委员会的代表，我必须就你的司令部拒绝合作以维护正义的原则一点提出抗议。
    因为本委员会即将结束并由于本委员会无法对被控战俘进行审判，本委员会不得已并在提出抗议之后默从你方所采取的主张。同时我必须继续希望你方为了司法的利益，将不采取任何会破坏正义并使罪犯能逃出法网的步骤。我也必须说明，这一责任是在于联合国军而不在于任何其他当局。
    是在这种情况下，我才要在二月十八日十时把这十七名战俘随同有关记录交由你看管。”
    六十三、一九五四年二月十六日，主席也致函朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面（注：见附件五十一）），告以所以要把战俘交给联合国军的情况。前此，在一九五四年二月十三日（注：见附件五
  （九）），朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面对拟议中的做法曾提出抗议。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面在收到主席一九五四年二月十六日函以后，在一九五四年二月十七日的来函中（注：见附件五
  （十三））又一次对战俘的移交提出了抗议。他们把移交战俘看作是违反“职权范围”与日内瓦公约。
    六十四、本委员会在其第七十八次会议上讨论了主席致双方各函。捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员发言注：见附件五（十二））反对将被控的战俘交由联合国军看管。他们认为这种步骤与以前将二万一千八百零五名战俘交还原拘留一方一样，是一种非法行为，既有背“职权范围”也违反停战协定。他们认为联合国军是处于那些犯有所述罪行的战俘组织的幕后的。因此，将被控的战俘交给曾以不合作来表示不准备协助执行司法的那一方，从政治、法律、与道德观点来看都是不能容许的。
    六十五、瑞典委员在其一九五四年一月二十七日的发言中表示了他的态度。照这一发言，他认为只要本委员会存在一天就有责任尽可能继续审判。鉴于本委员会本身的处境，也就是说鉴于没有辩护律师与证人以致无法继续审判，并鉴于本委员会即将解散，他认为除了主席所将采取的片面行动外，也就是说把战俘交给联合国军、希望其采取必要步骤来完成审判并依法惩处罪犯，别无他法。
    六十六、根据瑞士委员的意见，各被告于一九五四年一月二十二日后即应交与联合国军，并附以应采取何种进一步步骤的建议。这是本委员会所能采取的唯一步骤，因为按他的意见，战俘的看管已经结束，过了这一日期该项审判将以无裁判权而不能继续。而且由于其中的时间因素，即使完成了审判，法庭通过的任何判决是否能执行也是没有保证的。
    六十七、十七名被控的战俘及案件记录均于一九五四年二月十八日十时交与联合国军。在这样移交的战俘中，有三名被告，其实际审判曾经开始，但于一九五四年一月二十日陷于停顿（注：见第五十三段），而初步调查在其他十四名被告身上亦已确立了依据形迹上的证据而推定的谋杀案件。
    第八章  为战俘提供的医药支援
    六十八、由于印度不能应付战俘医院的工作人员与设备方面的要求，主席在本委员会成立以前，曾要求双方按照“职权范围”第十七款在军事分界线两边各自一方的非军事区内为所看管的战俘提供医院住房和设备。但印度能够提供战俘营中各健康检查室的全部工作人员。这一问题在本委员会一九五三年九月九日与十一日的会议上曾予以讨论，本委员会协议应要求原拘留双方对其移交给中立国遣返委员会的战俘提供医药设备。主席因此在一九五三年九月十三日致函双方说，如双方能给予本委员会所要求的这一协助，他将表示感激。
    六十九、联合国军表示，如果任何一方不把自己的人员或装备带进对方工作人员所管理的医院，则可同意。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面也同意了，但是说为了使战俘免受原拘留一方的任何影响，医院设备和工作人员应置于远离看管普通战俘的地方。工作人员在一九五三年九月十七日左右移入。
    七十、当本委员会于一九五三年九月二十六日讨论印度看管部队司令官所提出的在印度看管部队的南营保留联合国军所提供的某些主要勤杂人员这一要求时，波兰代表觉得该南营医院工作人员太多，要求作出安排以便对该医院进行访问。主席同意了，并为附属于各代表团的诸位医生作了安排，以便在一九五三年十月一日至该医院进行访问。在进行访问时，医院营场及邻近各营场的战俘都举行了示威。印度看管部队被迫向邻近的庚字围场第四十三号营场开枪，酿成若干伤亡。后来附属机构各委员不愿冒险进入医院，因此那次访问只得停止，而小组也因此未能访问这个医院的全部。
    七十一、那次访问之后，波兰医务官提出了一份关于这个医院的报告，这一报告在一九五三年十月六日由波兰委员提交本委员会。该报告要求进行安排对该医院的全部再作一次访问，并且说有证据说明该医院是各战俘营场之间的一个组织的中心。医院中所设床位的数目过多，行政人员对医务人员的比例数也是过大。本委员会同意当战俘们略较安静时，再安排一次对医院的访问。
    七十二、一九五三年十月八日，印度看管部队医务处副处长根据波兰医生的发言提出了一个报告。他说，如把战俘生活的恶劣条件以及联合国军交来的长期病号约有一千名左右的事实估计在内，则所设床位并不过多。他并不觉得行政人员或医务人员已为数过多。那一数目和有二千床位的正常的印度陆军医院所需要的数目是相彷佛的。
    七十三、一九五三年十一月二十一日，在本委员会的会议上讨论了这个报告。波兰委员说，他的医务官已研究了印度看管部队的报告，并仍然保持其以前的意见。该医院被利用来影响战俘以及该医院在战俘营所存在的恐怖组织中占有中枢地位的事实，似无可怀疑之处。因此有必要指定一附属机构以对该医院进行一次彻底调查。捷克斯洛伐克委员支持他的意见。瑞士与瑞典委员虽然认为根据野战医院的国际标准，该院床位及医务行政工作人员绝不过多，但是仍同意在医院中如有任何政治活动则应该予以制止。本委员会决定组织一个附属机构以研究该医院的工作。
    七十四、印度看管部队医务处副处长在一九五三年十一月二十七日答复了波兰委员的指控，并再次说明该医院布置仅够应付所有意外事件。印度看管部队司令官提出了一个个别报告，（注：见“临时报告”附件十七（丙））报告说看来毫无疑问该医院正被利用作为一个中心来组织战俘、传递信息、并与非军事区以外的人通讯，而且该医院的某些工作人员是牵涉在内的。
    第九章  结  论
    七十五、本委员会认为重复其已经得出的、并在其“临时报告”中已申述过的结论是不必要的，（注：瑞士与瑞典委员的结论载于本委员会“临时报告”所附的瑞士、瑞典“个别报告”内。）那些结论和事实不仅未为“最后报告”所叙述的任何事物所损害，反而得到了更多的确证。军事法庭的审判经过及提起公诉一方与辩护一方证人的证词，都明白无误地说明战俘组织的存在（注：见“临时报告”第四部分第一章），并暴露了战俘组织的基本性质与目的。
    七十六、南营战俘组织及主持这些组织的领袖否定了关于自由选择的一切假设或妄言。在本委员会“临时报告”（第十一段）已陈述过，“任何愿意遣返的战俘都不得不秘密地冒着生命的危险”或经印度看管部队的卫兵予以保护。本委员会必须坦白陈述其以自己的经验为基础的信念，即若不更充分与进一步地执行“职权范围”而认为这些战俘已自愿选择了不遣返的说法，都是毫无任何证据作支持的妄言。
    七十七、本委员会必须同时声明：当缔约各方庄严签署“职权范围”的协议时，即赋予了本委员会以唯一的解释“职权范围”的权利。在行使这一权利时，本委员会已经决定：宣布解除战俘身分使之成为平民所必需的法律上的先决条件并不存在，因而这种“解除”是不合法的。
    七十八、瑞典与瑞士委员已将其对第七十六与第七十七段内所提及的主要问题的不同意见详陈于本报告的附录中。
    第十章  本委员会的解散
    七十九、在一九五四年二月十八日举行的本委员会第七十九次会议上，本委员会以多数票通过印度代表团所提出的关于解散本委员会的下述决议：
      “中立国遣返委员会
    鉴于‘职权范围’第十一款规定了一个期限，而超过这一期限本委员会即不能进行工作，
    决议本委员会于一九五四年二月二十一日二十四时宣布解散。”
    捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员认为这一决议是非法的，并对此提出抗议。
    各位委员对决议草案所持态度的发言以及捷克斯洛伐克与波兰委员的抗议均载于附件八。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军于一九五四年二月二十日对本委员会此项决定提出抗议。（注：见附件九）
      附    录
    瑞典与瑞士委员的不同结论
    本委员会瑞典与瑞士委员不赞同本报告第七十六与第七十七段内所含有的结论。他们虽然承认战俘营内存有坚强的战俘组织，但认为在本委员会的整个看管时期内，特别是在把战俘交还原拘留一方时，战俘们依然有机会申请遣返。在看管时期内实际上有不少战俘（七百二十六名）曾予遣返或申请送往中立国，即已说明此点。
    瑞典与瑞士委员同意“职权范围”的解释归本委员会。他们也承认本委员会已经以多数票决定对“职权范围”的有关规定作这样的解释，即宣布解除战俘身分使之成为平民的条件并未履行。但他们认为这一解释并不正确且有背于“职权范围”的文字与精神，他们并认为“职权范围”第十一款明确赋予本委员会以责任：在开始看管后之一百二十天期满时宣布解除战俘身分使之成为平民，并认为除这一期间的过程外其他条件无足轻重。
