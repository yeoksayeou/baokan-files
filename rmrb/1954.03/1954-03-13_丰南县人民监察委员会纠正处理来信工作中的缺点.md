    Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee Corrects Shortcomings in Handling Letters from the People

    A letter from the Fengnan County People's Supervisory Committee, Hebei Province: The "Summary of Readers' Letters" column on January 20th published a letter from Jin Mingqiao of the Tangshan Peasant News, criticizing our shortcomings in handling letters from the people. This criticism is correct, and we sincerely accept it.

    Last May, we successively received letters from the Tangshan Peasant News and the Tangshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office, relaying mass accusations of human rights violations by village cadres in the seventh district of our county. At the same time, we also received a letter directly from soldier Shen Kun. We immediately cooperated with the county's People's Armed Forces Department to investigate and handle the matter. District cadre Meng Xiangming's violation of human rights has been given an administrative warning, and he was ordered to go to Xiaozhanggezhuang to apologize to the person concerned.

    After this issue was resolved, we only replied to the Tangshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office and Comrade Shen Kun, but we forgot to reply to the Tangshan Peasant News. When the Tangshan Peasant News sent a letter the first time urging action, we replied perfunctorily, saying that we would promptly investigate and understand the situation; when they sent a letter the second time urging action, we irresponsibly said that we had not received the previously forwarded letters. Upon review, the reason for this error is mainly that we are not responsible enough in handling letters from the people, and secondly, the receiving and sending, and registration system is chaotic. We have now educated cadres to further emphasize the work of handling letters from the people, and are establishing various systems.

### 丰南县人民监察委员会纠正处理来信工作中的缺点

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    丰南县人民监察委员会纠正处理来信工作中的缺点
    河北省丰南县人民监察委员会来信：一月二十日“读者来信摘要”栏刊登了唐山农民报金明桥的来信，批评我们处理人民来信工作中有缺点。这一批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    去年五月，我们先后接到唐山农民报和唐山专署转来群众揭发我县七区区村干部侵犯人权的来信，同时还接到军人沈昆直接给我们的来信。我们当即协同县人民武装部作了调查和处理。区干部孟祥明侵犯人权，我们已给予行政警告处分，并责令他去小张各庄向当事人道歉。
    这一问题解决后，我们只将处理结果答复了唐山专署和军人沈昆同志，却忘记给唐山农民报回信。唐山农民报第一次来信催办时，我们敷衍了事地复信，说要及时调查了解；第二次来信催办时，我们竟然不负责任地说没有收到以前转来的信件。现在检查起来，产生这一错误的原因，主要是我们对待人民来信还不够负责，其次是收发、登记制度混乱。我们现在已教育干部进一步重视处理人民来信的工作，并正建立各种制度。
