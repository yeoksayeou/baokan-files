Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to TASS, at the morning session on March 15th of the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, Z. Novak, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report on the fourth item on the agenda: "Tasks for Developing Agriculture and Necessary Measures to Increase Agricultural Production in 1954 and 1955."

Novak pointed out: Accelerating agricultural development and rapidly increasing agricultural production are the main issues in all of the Party's work at the current stage. The achievements of Poland's socialist industrialization enable the Party today to concentrate all its efforts on developing agriculture. In order to guarantee a more rapid increase in the supply of agricultural products to residents and the national economy, it is necessary in 1954-1955 to increase the harvest of major grains to approximately 12 million tons; cattle to 8 million head; pigs to 11 million head; sheep to 4.5 million; to raise the annual average milk production per dairy cow to approximately 1,800 liters; and to greatly increase the yield per unit area of industrial raw material crops, root crops, vegetables, and fruits. Grain production has been, and remains, the fundamental and central issue in the development of our country's entire agricultural production.

Novak then discussed the state's assistance to laboring peasants in developing production, pointing out that last year, appropriations for land reclamation increased by 85 percent compared to 1952, and will increase by another 40 percent this year. At the end of January this year, the government decided to allocate 882.2 million zlotys (Polish currency) as long-term and short-term loans to help laboring peasants. Some resolutions recently adopted by the Polish government also stipulate other means of material encouragement to encourage individual laboring peasants to improve farm management, obtain higher yields, develop animal husbandry, and produce more agricultural products for the market. The provisions in the draft resolution of the Congress regarding maintaining the compulsory sales quota at the current level and expanding the scope of reductions in the coming years is an important step in this regard.

Novak emphasized that whether achievements are made in increasing agricultural production depends entirely on constantly strengthening the ties between the working class and the broad masses of laboring peasants. Only by creatively applying Lenin's principles of relying on the poor peasants, strengthening the alliance with the middle peasants, and adhering to the struggle against the rich peasants in all our activities, especially in our daily work, can we rely on the practical and concrete plans we have formulated to help peasants to expand and strengthen ties with peasants.

Novak pointed out that measures to increase the agricultural output of individual laboring peasants are closely linked to the struggle for the socialist transformation of the countryside. In the five years since the end of the First Party Congress, our country's agricultural producers' cooperatives have developed greatly. Currently, there are approximately 8,500 agricultural producers' cooperatives with approximately 200,000 participating farmers. They collectively own more than 1.5 million hectares of land. However, compared to our current tasks, these achievements are not large, because members of agricultural producers' cooperatives currently only account for 7 percent of all laboring peasants. In order to develop agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is necessary to strengthen political and organizational work among poor and middle peasants, refute and expose the absurd arguments of class enemies against cooperatives, and pay special attention to strengthening the ties between individual laboring peasants and the socialist agricultural sector. When organizing cooperatives, the principle of voluntariness must be strictly observed, and the principle of giving material encouragement to cooperative members must be strictly observed in improving labor productivity and raising production indexes. The state machine tractor station is the main way to help agricultural producers' cooperatives and the main lever for the socialist transformation of the countryside. This year, the number of machine tractor stations will reach 462. These machine tractor stations will have 19,700 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower).

State-owned farms are a considerably important factor in increasing agricultural production. The land of state-owned farms accounts for approximately 12.2 percent of the total arable land in Poland and owns 29,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower). Field work on state-owned farms is almost entirely mechanized, and the number of pigs, beef cattle, dairy cattle, and sheep has increased several times. In 1955, the crop yield of state-owned farms will increase by 150,000 to 170,000 tons compared to 1952, and the sugar beet yield will increase by 15 to 20 percent. In the next two years, the number of beef cattle and dairy cattle on state-owned farms will increase by 30 to 35 percent, and pigs will increase by 20 percent.

Novak also mentioned that reclaiming certain fertile areas of land can provide an important reserve force for increasing industrial production.

Novak then discussed improving leadership over agriculture, giving play to the initiative of peasants, training skilled agricultural workers, as well as the role of science in developing agricultural production and the Party's work in the countryside.

    在波兰统一工人党代表大会十五日会议上诺瓦克报告今明两年发展农业生产的任务
   【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员泽·诺瓦克，在第二次党代表大会十五日上午会议上，就第四项议程“一九五四年和一九五五年发展农业的任务和增加农业生产的必要措施”作了报告。
    诺瓦克指出：加速农业发展和急速增加农业生产，是党在现阶段全部工作中的主要问题。波兰社会主义工业化的成就使得党在今天能够集中一切力量来发展农业。为了保证更迅速地增加对居民和国民经济的农产品供应，必须在一九五四—一九五五年，把主要谷物的收获量增加到约一千二百万吨；牛增加到八百万头；猪增加到一千一百万口；羊增加到四百五十万只；每头乳牛的每年平均产乳量提高到约一千八百公升；并把工业原料作物、根类作物、蔬菜和水果的单位面积产量大大增加。谷物生产过去是、现在仍然是我们国家整个农业生产发展的基本和中心问题。
    诺瓦克接着谈到了国家对劳动农民发展生产的援助，他指出：去年，用于垦荒的拨款比一九五二年增加了百分之八十五，今年将再增加百分之四十。今年一月底政府决定拨八亿八千二百万兹罗提
  （波币名）作为长期和短期贷款来帮助劳动农民。波兰政府最近所通过的一些决议还规定了另外一些物质鼓励的办法，鼓励个体劳动农民改善农庄经营、获得更高产量、发展饲畜业和为市场生产更多的农产品。代表大会决议草案关于在今后几年内把义务交售额维持在目前的水平并扩大减免范围的规定，是这一方面的一个重要步骤。
    诺瓦克强调说：在增加农业生产方面是否获得成就，完全取决于经常不断地加强工人阶级和广大劳动农民的联系。只有在我们的一切活动中，特别是在日常工作中，创造性地运用列宁的关于依靠贫农、加强和中农的联盟并坚持对富农的斗争的原理，那么，我们才能依靠我们所拟订的实际而具体地帮助农民的计划，来扩大和加强与农民的联系。
    诺瓦克指出：增加个体劳动农民的农业产量的措施，是和农村社会主义改造的斗争密切联系的。在第一次党代表大会结束以来的五年中，我国的农业生产合作社已大大发展了。目前约有八千五百个农业生产合作社，入社农民约有二十万人。它们共拥有一百五十多万公顷的土地。但是，这和我们当前的任务比较起来，这些成就并不算大，因为农业生产合作社的社员目前只占全体劳动农民的百分之七。为了发展农业生产合作社，必须加强对贫农和中农的政治工作和组织工作，必须驳斥和揭发阶级敌人反对合作社的荒谬论调，特别注意加强个体劳动农民和社会主义农业部门之间的联系。在组织合作社时，要严格遵守自愿的原则，在提高劳动生产率和提高生产指数等方面，要严格遵守给合作社社员以物质鼓励的原则。国家机器拖拉机站是帮助农业生产合作社的主要方式，是农村社会主义改造的主要杠杆。今年，机器拖拉机站的数目将达到四百六十二个。这些机器拖拉机站将有一万九千七百台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）。
    国营农场是提高农业生产的相当重要的因素。国营农场的土地约占波兰耕地总面积的百分之十二点二，拥有二万九千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）。国营农场的田间工作几乎全部机械化了，猪、食用牛、乳牛和绵羊的头数增加了好几倍。一九五五年国营农场的农作物产量要比一九五二年增加十五万到十七万吨，甜菜产量将要增加百分之十五到二十。在今后两年内，国营农场食用牛和乳牛的头数将增加百分之三十到三十五，猪将增加百分之二十。
    诺瓦克还提到开垦某些地区的十分肥沃的土地，可以为增加工业生产提供重要的后备力量。
    诺瓦克接着谈到了改进对农业的领导、发挥农民的积极性、训练熟练的农业工作人员、以及科学在发展农业生产中的作用和党在农村的工作等问题。
