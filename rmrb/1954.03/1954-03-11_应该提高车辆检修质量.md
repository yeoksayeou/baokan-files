Column: Reader's Letters Summary

    Editor's Note: The following three letters from readers reflect the serious situation of some railway vehicle departments neglecting the quality of vehicle maintenance and failing to comply with railway regulations. The work of railway vehicle departments is related to the safety of train operations and the efficiency of railway transportation. However, some vehicle depots in certain railway bureaus have a tendency toward departmentalism and a purely task-oriented view. When repairing vehicles, they only care about completing the repair numbers but do not pay attention to the quality of maintenance, resulting in a large number of technically deficient vehicles running freely on the railway lines, increasing the possibility of train accidents. This not only hinders the railway transportation industry from better serving the country's industrial construction and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, but may also cause huge losses to state property. Therefore, the Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways should urge vehicle departments at all levels to inspect the work of their subordinate vehicle depots, educate cadres to establish an overall perspective, and conscientiously promote the advanced experience of the China-Changchun Railway, to strive to improve vehicle quality and eliminate train accidents.

    Don't Let Technically Deficient Cars Pass
    Xiao Lian from the Nanchang Transportation Sub-bureau Traffic Safety Supervision Office writes: Last October, the Ministry of Railways vehicle inspection team inspected the vehicle depots in Guangzhou, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, and Nanchang, as well as the train repair shops at various stations and lines, and found that many units often failed to conduct scheduled inspections and repairs on trains on time, seriously neglecting vehicle quality. Leading comrades from the Ministry of Railways Vehicle Bureau and Soviet experts gave a special report to relevant personnel, criticizing the erroneous practice of focusing on quantity rather than quality in maintenance work. Responsible cadres such as the depot chiefs listened to the report, discussed it, and formulated specific measures to improve their work. However, a few days later, at Xiangxi Station within the jurisdiction of the Nanchang Sub-bureau, a train No. 21020 originating from Guangzhou and bound for the Shanghai Railway Bureau was found to have eight closed cars among its twenty-one insulated cars, and four cars were continuously coupled in violation of railway technical management regulations. In order to prevent accidents en route, the traffic safety supervisor of the Nanchang Sub-bureau detained the train at Xiangxi Station for transport and repair. On November 21st, at Shangrao Station of the Shanghai Railway Administration, train No. 858 originating from Guangzhou was found to have eight wheel treads with excessive abrasion; however, this train was released from the Guangzhou Vehicle Depot and passed through the Guangnan, Shaoguan, Chenxian, Hengyang, Zhuzhou, Pingxiang, Xinyu, and Xiangxi train repair shops under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, as well as the Yingtan train repair shop under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, traveling 1,247 kilometers without being detected. Such a technically deficient car traveled "unimpeded and unchecked" all the way, posing a great threat to traffic safety.
    According to the technical management regulations of the Ministry of Railways, it is forbidden to incorporate cars with excessively abraded wheel treads into trains; moreover, the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly instructed all depots not to release technically deficient cars to each other. The Guangzhou Railway Administration's continuous release of technically deficient cars shows that they do not pay enough attention to vehicle maintenance issues and have not implemented the spirit of higher-level instructions in their specific work.

    Improve Braking Devices on Vehicles
    Geng Huairen from the Boketu Vehicle Depot writes: The braking device on a vehicle is the main part that ensures the safe operation of trains at high speeds on the railway. Therefore, the quality of brake maintenance is closely related to the safety of train operation. Since 1951, accidents caused by brake failure or poor maintenance have occurred from time to time. For example, on September 27th last year, when train No. 21001 arrived at Lamadianzi Station, nearly half of the brakes failed, causing a serious train collision accident. On January 4th of this year, at Daguanling Station within the jurisdiction of the Mudanjiang Sub-bureau, a train caused a signal overrun accident due to excessive brake failure on vehicles. The locomotive and vehicles overturned, and three locomotive crew members were killed on the spot. The losses suffered by the state in this type of accident are incalculable.
    However, the above situation has not given the relevant leading departments the lessons they should have learned, and the brake maintenance situation is still very poor. We inspected four trains in two days from January 7th to 8th and found that 28% of the vehicles had lost their braking effectiveness, and the piston strokes of many were not up to standard. We also inspected 427 cars on January 14th of this year and found that 149 of them had brake strokes that did not meet the standards (although they were immediately adjusted, they have affected the on-time performance of subsequent trains). More seriously, the entire brake stroke of the two trains No. 21003 and 21067 on that day did not meet the standards.
    Since February of last year, I have continuously reported the deterioration of train braking to the People's Railway Daily and the Vehicle Department of the Harbin Railway Administration, but it has not received enough attention from the leading departments, so that accidents continue to occur, causing irreparable losses to state property. It is recommended that the Vehicle Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways cooperate with the supervisory agencies to deeply understand the problems existing in vehicle braking, and severely criticize and give necessary punishments to units that violate technical management regulations and release vehicles in poor technical condition, in order to gradually reduce or even eliminate train accidents caused by poor brakes.

    Why is the Train Maintenance System Reduced to a Mere Formality?
    Qun Yi from the Baichengzi Transportation Sub-bureau writes: Recently, we inspected the Baichengzi and Zhengjiatun train repair shops and found that 432 of the 1,947 cars were technically deficient, with the most damage to the brake beams and safety brackets. These cars were all released from other bureaus, but the Baichengzi and Zhengjiatun train repair shops adopted an irresponsible attitude, always emphasizing that they did not have materials or time for repairs; they even used the excuse that the country urgently needed vehicles and arbitrarily released unqualified trains, which seriously affected traffic safety. We have reported the above situation to the leading departments of the train repair shops—the vehicle depot. The cadres in the depot believe that the poor quality of repaired cars is a common occurrence, turn a blind eye to violations of regulations, and even openly release technically deficient cars.
    I believe that the reason why the vehicle maintenance system has become a mere formality is mainly that the railway's vehicle departments at all levels have relaxed leadership and inspection, so that technically deficient cars are running everywhere, increasing the occurrence of accidents. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Railways will quickly put forward improvement measures to ensure the safety of passenger and freight transportation.

### 应该提高车辆检修质量

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该提高车辆检修质量
    编者按：下面发表的三封读者来信，反映了某些铁路车辆部门忽视车辆检修质量以及不遵守铁路规章的严重情况。铁路车辆部门的工作，关系着行车安全和铁路运输的效率。可是有些路局的车辆段存在着本位主义和单纯任务观点，在修车时只关心完成修车数字，却不注意检修质量，致使大批技术不良的车辆在铁路线上自由运行，增加了发生行车事故的可能性。这种情况不但妨碍了铁路运输事业更好地为国家工业建设和城乡物资交流服务，而且还可能造成国家财产的巨大损失。因此，铁道部车辆局应督促各级车辆部门对所属车辆段的工作进行检查，教育干部树立整体观念，并认真推广中长路的先进经验，为提高车辆质量和消灭行车事故而斗争。
    不要让技术不良车通行
    南昌运输分局行车安全监察室效廉来信：去年十月间，铁道部车辆检查组检查了广州、衡阳、株州、南昌四个车辆段及各站、线的列车检修所，发现很多单位对列车经常不按时进行定检扣修，严重地忽视车辆质量。铁道部车辆局领导同志和苏联专家就专门对有关人员作了一次报告，批判了检修工作中单顾数量不求质量的错误作法。各段段长等负责干部听了报告后进行了讨论，并订出了改进工作的具体措施。但是，几天以后，在南昌分局管内的向西站发现一列由广州始发到上海路局去的第二一○二○次列车，其中二十一辆保温车中就有八辆是关门车，并有四辆违反了铁路技术管理规程连续连挂。为了防止在途中发生事故，南昌分局行车安全监察员就把该列车扣留在向西站运休待修。到十一月二十一日，在上海铁路管理局的上饶站又发现由广州始发的第八五八次列车有八个车轮踏面全部擦伤过限；可是这节列车从广州车辆段放行，途中经过广州路局所辖的广南、韶关、郴县、衡阳、株州、萍乡、新喻、向西列车检修所及上海路局所辖的鹰潭列车检修所，走行了一千二百四十七公里竟未被发现。这样一辆技术不良车一路“通行无阻、漏检漏扣”，对行车安全是个很大的威胁。
    按照铁道部技术管理规程的规定，车轮踏面擦伤过限是禁止编入列车的；而且铁道部也一再指示各段不得互放技术不良车。广州铁路管理局连续放出技术不良车，这说明他们对车辆检修问题不够重视，没有把上级指示的精神贯彻到具体工作中去。
    改善车辆上的制动装置
    博克图车辆段耿怀仁来信：车辆上的制动装置是保证列车在铁路上高速度安全行驶的主要部分，因此制动机检修的质量和列车的运行安全有很大关系。一九五一年以来，由于制动机失效或检修不良而造成的事故时有发生。如去年九月二十七日，第二一○○一次列车行抵喇嘛甸子车站时，由于将近半数的制动机失效，造成列车冲突的严重事故。今年一月四日，牡丹江分局管内的大官岭车站有一个列车因车辆制动机失效过多而肇成冒出信号事故，机车、车辆颠覆，机车乘务员三名当场殉职。在这一类事故中，国家所受的损失是无法计算的。
    但是，以上情况并没有使有关领导部门得到应有的教训，制动机检修情况仍旧很不好。我们在一月七日至八日两天内检查了四个列车，发现有百分之二十八强的车辆已失去了制动效能，很多鞲鞲行程也不合标准。我们又在今年一月十四日检查了四百二十七辆车，发现其中有一百四十九辆车制动行程不合标准（虽然立即进行了调整，但已影响以后列车的正点）。更严重的是当日第二一○○三次和二一○六七次两个列车的全部制动行程竟全部不合标准。
    从去年二月份起，我就把列车制动恶化的情况陆续反映给人民铁道报社及哈尔滨铁路管理局车辆处等单位，但一直没有引起领导部门足够的重视，以致事故仍然继续发生，造成国家财产无可弥补的损失。建议中央铁道部车辆局配合监察机构深入了解车辆制动中存在的问题，对违反技术管理规程及排放技术状态不良车辆的单位给以严厉的批评和必要的处分，以期逐渐减少以至于消灭因制动机不良而肇成的行车事故。
    为什么使列车检修制度流于形式
    白城子运输分局群一来信：最近，我们对白城子和郑家屯两列车检修所进行了检查，发现在一千九百四十七辆车中就有四百三十二辆是技术不良车，其中以制动梁及安全托遭受损坏的为最多。这些车全部是由外局放入的，但白城子和郑家屯两列车检修所却采取了不负责任的态度，总是强调没有材料或者没有时间而不加修理；甚至借口国家急需车辆使用，就擅自把不合规格的列车放走，以致严重影响行车安全。我们曾把上述情况反映给列车检修所的领导部门——车辆段，段上干部却认为检修车质量不佳是普遍情况，对违章作业等现象熟视无睹，甚至公开放出技术不良车。
    我认为，车辆检修制度所以流于形式，主要是铁路上各级车辆部门放松了领导和检查，以致技术不良车四处通行，增加了事故的发生。希望中央铁道部迅速提出改进措施，以保障旅客和货物的运送安全。
