Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 10th: The US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," signed in Tokyo on the 8th, has not only been strongly opposed by the Japanese people, but, according to Agence France-Presse, even "most Conservative Party followers and important newspapers" are "unenthusiastic" about the agreement, considering it a "disaster."

    Hiroo Wada, Secretary-General of the Japanese Left-wing Socialist Party, stated that his party opposes the agreement. He said: The "assistance" provided by the United States "is purely military assistance." "The United States, through a military advisory group of up to 600 people, will comprehensively interfere in our domestic affairs, such as defense, foreign policy, budget, finance, trade, etc. This danger is about to become a reality." Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japanese Right-wing Socialist Party, also criticized that after the signing of this agreement, "Japanese politics will inevitably move in a reactionary, backward direction of rearmament and constitutional revision."

    Japanese bourgeois public opinion has expressed concern about the consequences that the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" will bring to Japan. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated on the 8th that this agreement should never have been signed. The newspaper said: This agreement clearly makes Japan take the road of rearmament, and rearmament violates Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which condemns war. It also pointed out: The obligation of rearmament that Japan is now undertaking is full of danger. The newspaper also expressed concern that the agreement did not guarantee that Japan would not be forced to send troops abroad. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also worried about the danger of the US military assistance advisory group interfering in Japanese domestic affairs.

    Japanese economic figures, who had hoped to use US "aid" to save Japan's economic crisis, also expressed that they could not be optimistic about this purely military "assistance." According to Kokusai News Agency, Japanese financial circles believe that this agreement "will not have a good impact on the entire Japanese economy, although this agreement will increase arms production." Aiichiro Fujiyama, President of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in commenting on the agreement: "Financial circles should not have too much hope for this agreement." Kogoro Uemura, Vice Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, said, "It would be excessive to think that the munitions industry will become the pillar of reviving the entire Japanese economy."

### 日本舆论反对美日“共同防御援助协定”

    日本舆论反对美日“共同防御援助协定”
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：八日在东京签订的美日“共同防御援助协定”不但遭到日本人民的强烈反对，据法新社说，甚至“大多数保守党的追随者和重要报纸”对这个协定都“毫不热情”，认为它是一件“祸事”。
    日本左派社会党总书记和田博雄表示该党反对这个协定，他说：美国提供的“援助”，“纯粹是军事援助”。“美国将通过数达六百人的军事顾问团，对于我国内政，诸如国防、外交方针以及预算、财政、金融、贸易等等，全面地进行干涉，这种危险性即将成为现实”。日本右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎也指责说：这个协定签订后，“日本的政治必然地要走向重整军备、修改宪法的反动的开倒车的方向”。
    日本资产阶级舆论对美日“共同防御援助协定”将带给日本的后果表示忧虑。八日的“朝日新闻”认为，照理决不应该签订这个协定，该报说：这个协定明确地使日本要走重新武装的道路，而重新武装是违反日本宪法中斥责战争的第九条。它并指出：日本现在所承担的重新武装的义务，是充满危险的。该报还对协定并没有保证日本不会被迫派遣部队出国一事表示担心。“读卖新闻”也忧虑美国军事援助顾问团干预日本内政的危险。
   　曾希望利用美“援”来挽救日本经济危机的日本经济界人士，也表示对这种纯军事性的“援助”不能乐观。据国际新闻社讯，日本财政界人士认为，这个协定，“不会对日本整个经济有良好的影响，尽管这个协定会增加军火生产”。日本商工会议所会长藤山爱一郎在评论这个协定时说：“财政界人士不应该对这个协定抱太大的希望”。日本经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎说，“若认为军火工业将成为复兴日本整个经济的支柱，那是过分的。”
