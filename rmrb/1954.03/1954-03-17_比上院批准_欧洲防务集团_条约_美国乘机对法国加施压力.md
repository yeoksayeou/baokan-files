    Belgian Upper House Approves "European Defence Community" Treaty
    US Takes Opportunity to Pressure France
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] Brussels Dispatch: After two weeks of fierce debate, the Belgian Senate approved the "European Defence Community" treaty on the 12th with 125 votes in favor, 40 votes against, and 2 abstentions.
    The debate and voting on the "European Defence Community" treaty in the Belgian Senate, like the debate and voting in the Lower House last November, caused a deep split within the various bourgeois political parties. Moreover, the proportion of votes against the treaty increased somewhat. During the debate, many members of bourgeois political parties stated in their speeches that they opposed the ratification of the "European Defence Community" treaty, believing that the treaty violated the constitution, infringed upon Belgian sovereignty, and would revive West German militarism. During the vote, many members of the Catholic Social Party, the Socialist Party, and the Liberal Party disregarded their party's voting discipline and voted against the treaty together with the Communist Party members.
    The United States, anxious about the long-term failure to realize the "European Army" plan, took the opportunity to exert pressure on France. According to reports from Paris, U.S. Ambassador to France Dillon met with French Foreign Minister Bidault twice within 24 hours before and after the Belgian Senate's approval of the "European Defence Community" treaty to discuss issues such as the ratification of the "European Defence Community" treaty. On the same day as the Belgian Senate vote, West Germany's "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" also threatened France, saying that if the French Parliament did not ratify the "European Defence Community" treaty, the United States and Britain might sign an agreement with West Germany on their own, abolish the occupation regulations, recruit West German troops, or allow Greece, Turkey, and West Germany to form an alliance, thereby connecting West Germany with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    比上院批准“欧洲防务集团”条约
    美国乘机对法国加施压力
    【新华社十五日讯】布鲁塞尔消息：比利时议会上院经过两个星期的激烈辩论后，在十二日以一百二十五票赞成、四十票反对和两票弃权，批准了“欧洲防务集团”条约。
    比利时议会上院对“欧洲防务集团”条约的辩论和表决，和去年十一月下院辩论和表决这个条约时一样，在资产阶级各政党内部发生了深刻的分裂，而反对的票数，在比重上还有些增加。在辩论中，许多资产阶级政党的议员在发言时表示反对批准
  “欧洲防务集团”条约，认为这个条约违反宪法，侵犯比利时的主权，并且要使西德军国主义复活。在表决时，天主教社会党、社会党和自由党都有许多议员不顾本党的投票纪律，和共产党议员一道投反对票。
    因“欧洲军”计划长时期未能实现而焦躁不安的美国乘机对法国施行压力。据巴黎消息，美国驻法国大使狄龙在比利时议会上院批准“欧洲防务集团”条约前后二十四小时内，曾两次会见法国外交部长皮杜尔，谈批准“欧洲防务集团”条约等问题。在比利时上院表决的同一天，西德的“法兰克福环球报”也恫吓法国说：如果法国议会不批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，美国和英国就可能自行和西德签订协定，废除占领法规，招募西德军队，或者让希腊、土耳其和西德联盟，而使西德和北大西洋公约联系起来。
