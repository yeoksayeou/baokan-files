Soldier Park Si-hyun from a certain unit of the People's Army wrote on a wall newspaper commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death: "A year ago, we were extremely saddened when we heard the news of Stalin's death at the front, but we immediately transformed our grief into strength, held our positions, and repelled the enemy's frantic attacks.
