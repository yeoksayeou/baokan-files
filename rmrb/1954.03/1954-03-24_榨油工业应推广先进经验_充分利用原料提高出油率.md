    Oil Extraction Industry Should Promote Advanced Experience
    Fully Utilize Raw Materials to Increase Oil Yield

    Editor's Note: In order to ensure an adequate supply of oil and continuously improve the people's living standards, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Increasing the Production of Oil Crops" on December 25th of last year. In addition, oil extraction plants in various regions should also fully utilize raw materials and increase oil yield to increase the production of edible oil. The Northeast region has already summarized and promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction operation method and has achieved very good results in this regard. According to readers' letters, some oil plants are now blindly pursuing more oil stacks (note: a stack is the raw material piled on the oil extraction equipment) in production, resulting in waste of oil and reduced oil yield. It is hoped that oil extraction plants in various regions will actively study and improve operating techniques, summarize and promote advanced production experience, so that existing oil materials can produce more edible oil.
      (I)
    Wang Yumin of the Songjiang Provincial Enterprise Company writes: In the first half of last year, oil plants in Songjiang Province promoted Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction operation method, and the average oil yield in the province was 12.1%, an increase of 1.25% compared to 1952. However, in the fourth quarter of last year, oil plants in more than ten counties did not implement the Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method, but adopted the method of unlimited stacking to increase production, resulting in a sharp drop in oil yield. The oil yield of oil plants in Tonghe and Mulan counties remained at the level of 8% to 9%. In Wuchang Oil Plant, the average oil yield was 12.17% when no stacking was added in October; in November, 13 stacks were added, and the oil yield dropped to 11.6%; in December, two more stacks were added, and the oil yield dropped to 11.21%.
    Adopting the method of unlimited stacking beyond the capacity of the equipment seems to increase production on the surface; however, due to the shortening of pressing time and oil seepage time, the oil in the oil material is not completely extracted before pressing stops, which not only reduces the oil yield but also wastes raw materials. This is contrary to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. At the same time, the stacking method will reduce the quality of soybean oil, affect the coagulation of protein in the beans, and the aggregation of small oil droplets, resulting in high moisture and low temperature in soybean oil.
    Implementing and carrying out Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction method can avoid stacking and increase oil yield. It is recommended that all oil plants in Songjiang Province adhere to the implementation of Li Chuanjiang's oil extraction method to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy.
    In order to avoid the occurrence of stacking, the grain departments of Songjiang Province should also gradually strengthen planning in the procurement and supply of oil materials, soybean oil, and oil cake, so that oil extraction plants have the conditions to produce in a balanced manner. The frequent shutdowns for lack of materials in the second and third quarters and the rush production in the first and fourth quarters in Songjiang Province's oil extraction industry last year were objective reasons that contributed to the stacking phenomenon.
        (II)
    Zhang Bingqian of the Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company writes: In December of last year, the Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company allocated 600,000 jin of peanut kernels to the Jiucheng Oil Plant (hereinafter referred to as the Oil Plant) of the Shulu County Cooperative Federation for processing. The first batch of peanut kernels had a high moisture content, and the Oil Plant did not carefully press them, so each hundred jin of raw materials could only produce 21 or 22 jin of oil. Later, the Hebei Provincial Oil and Fat Company transferred this batch of wet material to a certain oil mill for pressing, and the oil yield per hundred jin of raw materials immediately increased to 30 jin. And the Oil Plant received good materials, but each hundred jin only yielded 31 or 32 jin of oil; after testing, the oil content of the produced oil cake was still 4% to 5% higher than that of ordinary oil cake. It is calculated that the oil extracted by the Oil Plant per hundred jin of raw materials is 4 to 9 jin less than that of ordinary oil mills and oil plants. If calculated according to the total amount of raw materials they processed, the state will suffer a loss of about 30,000 jin of peanut oil.
    Why does this happen? The main reason is that the leading cadres of the Oil Plant have a simple "profit" view, only seeking to extract more raw materials and receive more processing fees, while not caring about increasing oil yield and saving state assets. They only regard "extracting more oil stacks" as an indicator of production increase competition. In order to extract more oil stacks, the workers are not careful when roasting raw materials, and they do not straighten the oil stacks when they are skewed during pressing, and even unload them and replace them with new stacks before the oil stacks are fully pressed. As a result: the oil yield is reduced, the oil content of the oil cake is increased, the raw materials are wasted, and the increase in production and savings has turned into a reduction in production and waste.

### 榨油工业应推广先进经验  充分利用原料提高出油率

专栏：读者来信摘要

    榨油工业应推广先进经验
    充分利用原料提高出油率
    编者按：为了保证油料的适当供应，保证人民生活不断提高的需要，中央人民政府政务院已在去年十二月二十五日发布了“关于增产油料作物的指示”。此外，各地榨油厂也应该充分利用原料，提高出油率，以增加食油的产量。东北地区已经总结和推广了李川江先进榨油操作法，在这方面取得了很好的效果。据读者来信反映，现在，有某些油厂在生产中采取了盲目追求多榨油垛（按：垛是堆在榨油设备上的原料。）的办法，结果浪费了油料，降低了出油率。希望各地榨油工厂积极研究改进操作技术，总结并推广先进生产经验，使现有的油料生产更多的食油。
      （一）
    松江省企业公司王育民来信：松江省各地油厂在去年上半年推广了李川江先进榨油操作法，全省平均出油率为百分之十二点一，比一九五二年提高了百分之一点二五。但是，去年第四季度内有十多个县份的油厂没有贯彻李川江榨油法，采取了无限制的加垛办法来增加产量，因此出油率骤减。通河、木兰两县的油厂出油率仍停留在百分之八至九的水平上。五常油厂十月份没有加垛时平均出油率百分之十二点一七；十一月份加了十三个垛，出油率降低到百分之十一点六；十二月份又加了两个垛，出油率又降到百分之十一点二一。
    采取无限制的超过设备能力的加垛办法，表面上似乎增加了产量；但是由于压榨时间、渗油时间缩短了，油料内的油尚未榨完就不榨了，不仅降低了出油率，而且浪费了原料。这是和增产节约的精神相违背的。同时，加垛办法会降低豆油的质量，影响豆内蛋白质的凝固，小油滴的集聚，使豆油水分高、温度低。
    推行和贯彻李川江榨油法，就可以避免加垛，提高出油率。建议松江省各油厂坚持执行和贯彻李川江榨油法，达到增产节约的目的。
    为了避免加垛现象的发生，松江省粮食部门在油料以及豆油、油饼的采购供应工作中也应该逐步加强计划性，使榨油工厂有条件来均衡生产。松江省榨油工业在去年二、三季度内经常停工待料，一、四季度内突击生产，这是助长加垛现象的一个客观原因。
        （二）
    河北省油脂公司张秉谦来信：去年十二月河北省油脂公司拨交束鹿县合作社联合社旧城油厂（以下简称油厂）花生仁六十万斤进行加工。第一批花生仁潮分较大，油厂也不认真榨制，因此每百斤原料只能出二十一、二斤油。后来河北省油脂公司把这批潮料转拨给某油坊榨制，每百斤原料的出油量马上就提高到三十斤。而油厂领了好料，每百斤也只出到三十一、二斤油；所产油饼经化验后，含油率仍比一般油饼高百分之四至五不等。经计算，油厂每百斤原料所榨的油要比一般油坊和油厂少四斤到九斤。如果按照他们加工的原料总数计算，将使国家受到约三万斤花生油的损失。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？主要是因为油厂领导干部存在着单纯的“利润”观点，只图多榨原料、多领加工费，对提高出油率节约国家资财则毫不关心。他们光把“多榨油垛”作为增产竞赛的指标。工人们为了多榨油垛，炒原料时就不认真，榨油时油垛歪了也不扶正，甚至不等油垛榨干就卸下来另换新垛。结果是：出油率降低了，油饼含油率增大了，原料被糟蹋了，增产节约变成了减产浪费。
