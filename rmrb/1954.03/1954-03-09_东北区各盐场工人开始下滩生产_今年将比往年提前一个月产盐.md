    Workers in Salt Fields in Northeast China Begin Salt Production on the Beaches
    This Year's Salt Production Will Start One Month Earlier Than in Previous Years
    Workers in salt fields in Northeast China have started working on the beaches on March 1st, commencing this year's production. With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, and the increase in the demand for industrial salt and people's needs, the production task of salt fields in Northeast China this year will increase by an average of 50% compared with last year's actual output. Moreover, production will start one month earlier than in previous years, with formal and large-scale salt production beginning in early March.
    As early as after the end of last winter's production, the Northeast Salt Affairs Bureau and the Northeast Salt Industry Union, based on the increase production and practice economy movement, arranged this year's production preparations. Various fields have successively promoted the advanced experience of Liu Guoxi, a national salt industry labor model, in "drawing water under the ice to cultivate brine"; and launched a competition for cultivating brine and repairing beaches. In order to increase the brine concentration, many production teams worked on the beaches before dawn every day, even in the severe cold of minus ten degrees. As a result, the amount of brine stored this year exceeded that of the same period last year by a significant amount. For example, the Sanlitai and Sanguanmiao field affairs offices of the Jinzhou Salt Field took in a large amount of tidal water to the beach fields with the most serious water shortage in previous years as early as December last year. The amount of brine cultivated by the Wangjiawaizi Field Affairs Office in January this year exceeded that of the same period last year by 53%.
    This year's production task in the Northeast Salt District must be guaranteed to be completed without increasing the area of salt fields, equipment, and manpower, so the task is very arduous. However, due to the fact that the broad masses of employees have studied the general line and general task of the country, their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. In addition, this year's production preparations have been sufficient, with more new brine, less dead brine, and a high salt content. Moreover, with the experience of light moon production in April last year, the broad masses of employees have the confidence to complete and over fulfill this year's production task.
    With the increase in output this year, there may be an imbalance in labor load. The Northeast Salt Affairs Bureau has instructed all salt fields to pay attention to the adjustment of labor load during the peak production period and establish a labor transfer system to ensure safe production.

    东北区各盐场工人开始下滩生产
    今年将比往年提前一个月产盐
    东北各盐场工人已在三月一日下滩，开始了今年的生产工作。随着工农业的迅速发展，工业用盐和人民需要量的提高，今年东北各盐场的生产任务平均要比去年实产量提高百分之五十，而且要比往年提前一个月生产，在三月上旬就要正式大量产盐。
    早在去冬生产结束后，东北盐务局和东北盐业工会即在增产节约运动的基础上，布置了今年的生产准备工作。各场都陆续推广了全国盐业劳动模范柳国喜“冰下抽水养卤”的先进经验；并开展了养卤、修滩竞赛。为了提高卤水含量，很多生产小组即使在零下十度的严寒气候下，每天黎明前就下滩工作。因此，使今年的卤水结存量超过了去年同期很多。如金州盐场三里台、三官庙等场务所早在去年十二月即将历年缺水最严重的滩场纳入了大量潮水。王家隈子场务所今年一月份的养卤量超过了去年同期百分之五十三。
    东北盐区今年的生产任务要在不增加盐田面积、设备和人力等条件下保证完成，因此任务很艰巨。但由于广大职工学习了国家总路线和总任务，生产热情空前高涨，加以今年的生产准备工作充分，新卤多、死卤少，含盐率高，并且有了去年四月间淡月生产经验，广大职工有信心完成和超额完成今年的生产任务。
    随着今年产量的提高，可能产生劳动负荷不平衡的现象，东北盐务局已指示各盐场在旺产期重视劳动负荷的调剂工作，并建立劳动调动制度，以保证安全生产。　（时进）
