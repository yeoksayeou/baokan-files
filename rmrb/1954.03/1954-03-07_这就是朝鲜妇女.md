    This is a Korean Woman
    Wang Chengyuan

    Editor's Note: Starting from this issue, this publication will launch a special column called "Letters to the Motherland." This column uses the form of letters to report on the care of the volunteer soldiers for the construction of the motherland and the encouragement of the construction of the motherland to the volunteer soldiers, to report on the confidence and determination of the volunteer soldiers in defending the motherland and defending world peace, to report on the volunteer soldiers learning culture, improving military technology, vigilantly guarding the positions, and helping the Korean people to restore and rebuild. This column will also report on the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, and the selfless labor of the Korean people in the arduous struggle during the war and in the post-war reconstruction. We sincerely hope that the broad masses of readers, especially volunteer comrades, Chinese workers and technicians assisting Korea in recovery and construction, and other Chinese comrades who have visited Korea will assist us in making this column a success.

    Dear sisters of the motherland:

    In a few days, it will be the "March 8th" International Women's Day. Needless to say, on that day, you will celebrate your own festival with joy and cheer for your great victories in the cause of defending peace and building the motherland. Dear comrades, please allow me, on the distant Korean front, to extend my cordial greetings to you and wish you even greater achievements in the cause of socialist industrialization of the motherland!

    In Korea, this heroic country, I am constantly moved by the many inspiring and heroic deeds of Korean women. Especially now, as the festival of working women around the world approaches, I feel I have a lot to say to you. In the years of war, they sent their husbands and sons to the front lines, took on the work of husbands and sons, and many women personally went to the forefront of the motherland's anti-aggression war, even bravely dedicating their blood and lives; after the war, they quickly plunged into the Republic's reconstruction, began selfless labor, and struggled for a better tomorrow. They have already paid the greatest price for world peace and the happiness of all mankind, and have also set a brilliant example for us!

    There are too many touching deeds of heroic Korean women in the war. I just want to talk about one person, one thing. It was last July when our army launched a strong counterattack against the enemy on the Kim Seong front. Behind the position, there was a highway surrounding the mountains leading directly to the front line, which was the only transportation line. After the artillery fire started, whether day or night, the personnel and vehicles coming and going on this road were always in a constant stream. And July in Korea is the rainy season, this road was washed out, affecting the transportation to support the front line, so on this road, in the pouring rain, whether day or night, there were always groups of people repairing this road that was washed out by the water. Among these people were more than thirty women, who transported stones from the ravines, filling the road that was washed out by the rain. The heavy rain poured down for days, and the enemy's artillery and planes kept bombarding, but they acted as if nothing had happened, guaranteeing the smooth flow of this route at all costs. When tools were lacking, they used their own two hands to replace them. Some women's hands were bleeding, and some women's feet were blistered, but they were still working hard indifferently.

    On the evening of July 18th, a group of stretcher teams came down the road when suddenly, four enemy planes drilled out of the clouds and strafed them.

  A middle-aged stretcher bearer was hit by a bullet while covering a volunteer soldier who was wounded. At this time, a woman who was repairing the road shouted and rushed to the side of the stretcher bearer who was hit. When she ran there, the stretcher bearer had already fallen in a pool of blood. She took out a snow-white handkerchief, wiped the blood off his face, and stared at him intently. She looked very sad, but also very strong. She gritted her teeth and, taking advantage of the moment when the enemy plane flew away, was about to lift the stretcher with another stretcher bearer when the wounded soldier, who had been awakened from the bombing, opened his weak eyes and looked at everything around him. He understood everything, could not say a word, and tears streamed down his face. The woman's face, full of anger, immediately turned into compassionate concern. She gently stroked the wounded soldier and said kindly and decisively: "Comrade, don't be sad. All misfortunes are brought to us by the American devils. We must take revenge!" Although the language was not understandable, the wounded soldier had fully understood her meaning from her expression and tone. The wounded soldier closed his eyes, which were still shedding tears.

    Dear sisters, this is an ordinary Korean woman. Her name is Gu Fuli, and she is the chairperson of the Women's League Committee of Zhouyi Village, Changdao County, Jiangyuan Province. The stretcher bearer who had just been sacrificed was her husband, named Jin Fuhan, a member of the Labor Party. In the Battle of Shangganling, he had won the "Model of Supporting the Front" medal, and it was also at that time that his leg was injured, and the wound would ache whenever it was cloudy or rainy. However, after the artillery fire of the Kim Seong counterattack was launched, he signed up to join the stretcher team again. Before leaving, Gu Fuli asked him: "Can your leg take it?"

      "It's nothing."
    "Okay, then you go. If your leg hurts too much, just persevere a little!"

    Now, her husband has shed his last drop of blood for the victory of the Republic. Gu Fuli swallowed the tears that welled up in her eyes and made up her mind: "I will definitely complete the task that my husband did not complete!" So, she and another stretcher bearer lifted the stretcher and moved forward. The sky gradually darkened, the road was rugged and slippery, and they had to constantly cross flooded rivers. She had been working hard all day and hadn't eaten. Her face looked pale. Others advised her to rest for a while, but she replied firmly: "The wounded are important. Let's persevere. If I rest, I may not be able to lift it again!" She gritted her teeth and reached her destination. Sure enough, she fainted as soon as she put down the stretcher. After first aid, it took a while to wake up.

    That night, she returned home late at night. She had a fourteen-year-old boy who had been working hard all day at the boiling water station set up for the wounded and was now quietly waiting for his father and mother at home. But, comrades, the child did not expect that he would never see his father again. When his mother told him the unfortunate news, he couldn't help but cry. Gu Fuli hugged the child and said gently but firmly: "Child, we cannot yield to the enemy! Don't cry, and don't be afraid, remember this debt and avenge your father!" "Mom, I want to take revenge!" The child stopped crying. "Good boy." "Tomorrow, I won't go to the boiling water station. I want to carry stretchers!" "Can you carry it?" "I can carry it. If two people can't carry it, then we will carry it with four people!"

    So, the child immediately went to the village to contact other children.

    The next day, on that steel transportation line, a stretcher team consisting of more than thirty women and four children appeared. In the artillery fire, in the wind and rain, they kept transferring the wounded. Comrades, this is the women's stretcher team led by Gu Fuli! This stretcher team fought until the moment when the artillery fire completely stopped in Korea!

    Not long after the war stopped, the troops sent us, with gifts, to her home to express our condolences. At that time, she was leading the women of the whole village, actively working in the fields and on the ruins. Seeing us coming, she greeted us with a smile. She said to us: "Our construction has difficulties, but, comrades, don't worry, next time you come again, we will definitely be able to build this place more beautiful than before the war!"

    From her enthusiastic smile and simple words, I once again deeply felt a kind of strength, the strength of a heroic nation that can never be conquered.

    Dear sisters, let us pay tribute to these heroic Korean women! There are too many of them, too common, in Korea, in all positions! Gu Fuli is just one of them!

专栏：寄祖国

    这就是朝鲜妇女
    王程远
    编者按：从这一期起，本刊特辟“寄祖国”专栏。这一专栏是用写信的形式，报道志愿军战士对祖国建设的关怀和祖国建设对志愿军战士的鼓舞，报道志愿军保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的信心和决心，报道志愿军学习文化，提高军事技术，警惕地守卫阵地以及帮助朝鲜人民恢复和重建的情形。这个专栏还要报道中朝人民的兄弟般的友谊，报道朝鲜人民在战时的艰苦斗争和战后重建中的忘我劳动的情形。我们热忱期望广大读者，特别是志愿军同志，帮助朝鲜恢复和建设的中国工人、技术人员以及其他访问朝鲜的中国同志协助我们，把这个专栏办好。亲爱的祖国的姊妹们：
    再过些日子，就到“三八”国际妇女节了。不用说，到那一天，你们要欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝自己的节日，来欢呼自己在保卫和平和建设祖国事业中的巨大胜利。亲爱的同志们，请允许我，在遥远的朝鲜前线，向你们致以亲切的慰问，并预祝你们在祖国社会主义工业化的事业中取得更大的成就！
    在朝鲜这个英雄的国度里，我始终为朝鲜妇女许多可歌可泣的英勇事迹激动着。特别是现在，全世界劳动妇女的节日临近的时候，我更觉得有很多话要向你们说。她们，在战争的年代里，把自己的丈夫和儿子，送上前线，担当起丈夫和儿子的工作，许多妇女还亲自走到了祖国反侵略战争的最前线，甚至英勇地献出了自己的鲜血和生命；战争结束后，她们又很快地投入到共和国的恢复建设中去，开始了忘我的劳动，为一个美好的明天而斗争。她们，已经为全世界的和平和全人类的幸福付出了最大的力量，也为我们做出了光辉的榜样！
    朝鲜英雄的妇女，在战争中表现的感人的事迹太多了，我只想谈这样一个人，这样一件事。那是去年七月，我军在金城前线向敌人展开了强大的反击战。阵地的后方，有一条环绕着群山直通前沿的公路，这是一条唯一的运输线。炮火打响以后，不论白天黑夜，这条公路上来往的人员、车辆，总是川流不息。而朝鲜的七月，正是多雨的季节，这条公路被冲坏了，影响着支援前线的运输，于是在这条公路上，在倾盆的大雨中，不管是白天还是黑夜，总有成群的人在抢修这条被水冲坏的公路。在这些人群中有三十多个妇女，她们一趟一趟地从山沟里运来了石块，填补着被雨水冲坏了的公路。大雨连日倾泻着，敌人的大炮和飞机，不断地在轰击着，但是，她们却若无其事，冒着一切危险保证这条路线的畅通。工具缺乏，她们就用自己的
  一双手来代替。有些妇女的手流血了，有些妇女的脚磨破了，她们还是满不在乎地在紧张劳动着。
    七月十八日的傍晚，一批担架队沿公路下来了，突然，四架敌机从云缝里钻出来，跟踪扫射。
  一个壮年的担架队员，为了掩护志愿军伤员被一颗子弹打中了。这时正在修路的一个妇女叫了一声，向那个被打中的担架队员身边扑去。等她跑到那里时，那个担架队员已经倒在血泊里。她掏出雪白的手巾，擦了擦他脸上的鲜血，凝神地注视着他。看样子她十分难受，但也十分坚强。她咬了咬牙，趁着敌机飞走的时刻，就要和另一个担架队员抬起担架走，这时从轰炸声中惊醒过来的伤员睁开了无力的眼睛，看了看周围的一切。一切，他都全部明白了，一句话也说不出来，两眼扑簌簌地直淌眼泪。那个妇女满脸的愤怒立即变成慈祥的关切，她轻轻地抚摸着伤员，亲切而果断地说：“同志，别难过。一切不幸，都是美国鬼子给我们带来的，我们要报仇！”尽管语言不通，但从她的表情和声调中，伤员已经把她的意思全部领会了，伤员又闭上了他那还在冒着泪珠的眼睛。
    亲爱的姐妹们，这是一个普通的朝鲜妇女。她的名字叫具富丽，是江原道昌道郡邹依里女性同盟委员会的委员长。刚刚牺牲了的那个担架队员，就是她的丈夫，叫金富汉，是劳动党员。在上甘岭战斗中，他曾荣获过“支前模范”的奖章，也就在那个时候，他的腿受了伤，每逢阴天下雨，伤口就要发痛。但是，金城反击战的炮火打响了以后，他又报名参加了担架队。临走时，具富丽问他：“腿受得了吗？”
      “这没有什么。”
    “好，那你就去吧。腿痛得厉害了，就坚持着点！”
    现在，她的丈夫为了共和国的胜利，已经洒出自己最后的一滴鲜血。具富丽咽下了涌进了眼眶的泪水，下了决心：“我丈夫没有完成的任务，我一定替他完成！”于是，她就和另一个担架队员抬起担架前进了。天渐渐黑下来，路又崎岖又滑，又要不断穿过起了洪水的河流，她已经紧张劳动了一天，又没吃饭，她的脸显得苍白了。别人劝她休息一下，她坚强地回答：“伤员要紧，坚持着走吧，要是休息了，也许我再就抬不起来！”她就这样咬着牙到了目的地。果然，刚刚放下担架，她就昏过去了。经过急救，好一会才苏醒过来。
    那天晚上，她回到家里已经是深夜了。她有个十四岁的男孩子，白天在为伤员设立的开水站上劳累了一天，现在在家里静静等候着自己的爸爸和妈妈。可是，同志们，孩子并没有想到他再不能看到自己的爸爸了。当他妈妈告诉了他这个不幸的消息时，他就禁不住大哭起来。具富丽抱着孩子温和而又坚定地说：“孩子，我们不能向敌人屈服呀！不要哭，也不要怕，记住这笔债，给你爹报仇！”“妈，我要报仇！”孩子不哭了。“好孩子。”“明天，我不去开水站了。我要抬担架去！”“抬得动吗？”“抬得动。两个人抬不动，我们就四个人抬！”
    于是，那个孩子马上到村里去联络其他的小朋友了。
    第二天，在那条钢铁运输线上，就出现了一队由三十多个妇女和四个孩子组成的担架队。在炮火里，在风雨里，他们不停地转运着伤员。同志们，这就是由具富丽率领下的妇女担架队！这个担架队，一直战斗到炮火在朝鲜完全停止的时刻！
    战争停止以后不久，部队就派我们，带着礼品，到她家去慰问。那时，她正带着全里的妇女，在田野里，在废墟上积极地劳动着。看到我们来，就满面笑容地迎接过来。她对我们说：“我们的建设是有困难的，但是，同志们，你们放心吧，下次你们再来的时候，我们这里一定能建设得比战前更美好了！”
    从她热情的笑和朴实的话里，我再一次深深感到一种力量，英雄的民族永远不可能被征服的力量。
    亲爱的姐妹们，让我们向这些英雄的朝鲜妇女致敬吧！她们在朝鲜，在各个岗位上是太多了，太普遍了！具富丽只不过是其中的一个罢了！二月十八日
