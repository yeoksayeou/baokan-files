    Soviet People Welcome the Election
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    The election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet will be held on March 14. The Soviet people are welcoming it with labor and political enthusiasm that is rising day by day.

    This election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet is the fourth election since 1937, 1946, and 1950. The Soviet Supreme Soviet, with a term of four years, is elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot. It is the highest organ of state power. It is composed of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities, to ensure that it reflects both the general interests of all Soviet workers and the special interests of all Soviet nationalities. The Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet – the head of state – is elected by the Soviet Supreme Soviet. The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union – the highest administrative organ of the state – is formed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet. These are all events that have occurred in the period since the Soviet Union built a socialist society and, after the adoption of the new constitution in 1936, gradually transitioned from socialism to communism. Prior to this, when the Soviet Union was still in the transitional period of socialist transformation, in the period of socialist construction, and under the conditions of class struggle, the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union was the All-Union Congress of Soviets. In order to prevent elements of the exploiting classes from infiltrating into high-level state power organs, it was elected through multiple levels of elections. Workers elected representatives to the city, township, and village Soviets and to the congresses of Soviets of republics, border regions, and provinces. From these Soviets and congresses of Soviets, representatives were then elected to the All-Union Congress of Soviets. In order to consolidate the leading role of the working class in state power, at that time, one representative was elected for every 25,000 voters in cities, and one representative was elected for every 125,000 voters in rural areas. The All-Union Congress of Soviets elected the Central Executive Committee, composed of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities, which in turn elected the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee and formed the highest administrative organ of the state – the Soviet People's Commissariat. Therefore, the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union has developed from the three links during the construction of socialism – the All-Union Congress of Soviets, the Central Executive Committee, and the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee – to the two links during the construction of communism – the Soviet Supreme Soviet and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.

    The Soviet regime is a regime of laborers led by the working class and headed by the Communist Party. The Soviet Supreme Soviet, serving the people, determines the major affairs of the state according to the line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The current Soviet Supreme Soviet, like previous ones, has completed tremendous work. For example, in March 1953, after the death of Comrade Stalin, the Fourth Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet approved the list of government personnel proposed by Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. This session also passed a decree adjusting the structure of government departments. This decree improved and strengthened the work of state administration, reduced administrative expenses, and allowed many specialized personnel to move from offices to production. In this way, the state saved 6.5 billion rubles in 1953. The Soviet Supreme Soviet annually discusses and approves the state budget, which ensures the development of the Soviet national economy. In August 1953, the Soviet Supreme Soviet session passed a decree reducing agricultural taxes. This decree increased the income of Soviet farmers and boosted their enthusiasm for increasing production. The huge task that the Soviet people are now vigorously completing – to greatly increase the production of daily necessities in two to three years, and first to further develop the production of agriculture supplying food and raw materials – was proposed by Comrade Malenkov at the Fifth Session of the Soviet Supreme Soviet.

    Therefore, the Soviet people, who cherish their country and their regime, are welcoming the election of the Soviet Supreme Soviet as if it were a major national celebration. The election campaign began two months before the election day. After the Presidium of the Soviet Supreme Soviet promulgated the election day and electoral districts in accordance with the constitution, it then approved the list of the Central Electoral Commission, headed by Shvernik, proposed by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, based on the nominations of various social organizations and groups. Then, in the electoral districts, at meetings of various social organizations and groups, and at meetings of laborers, nominations of candidate representatives began. Next, candidate representatives are registered; meetings are held between candidate representatives and voters. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a letter to all voters, calling on them to participate in the election and to vote for the candidate representatives of the alliance of communists and non-communists. The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions also issued letters of the same nature to young voters and worker voters.

    In the movement to welcome the election, a huge propaganda and mobilization work is being carried out throughout the Soviet Union. Millions of people are directly participating in local election committees, mobilization stations, and propaganda teams. In Moscow alone, there are 1,400 mobilization stations, and nearly 300,000 mobilizers are carrying out mass work among the voters. The election has become the propaganda center of thousands of Soviet newspapers and a vast broadcast network during this period. The propaganda and mobilization teams vigorously publicize and explain to voters the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, the principles of the Soviet Constitution, and the superiority of the socialist social system and state system. The propaganda and mobilization work requires that every voter understand the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the recent decisions of the Party and government. For young voters participating in the election for the first time, the principles of the election law and the election system must also be publicized. This propaganda and mobilization work links political principles with the specific tasks of industrial, agricultural, and cultural construction. After the nomination of candidate representatives, the propaganda and mobilization work enters the crucial period of introducing the candidate representatives. Introducers and mobilizers enable voters to understand the social and political activities and work of the candidate representatives. Introducing candidate representatives is to ensure that outstanding individuals are elected to the highest organ of state power, and their examples also educate the people.

    All of the nominated candidate representatives are figures who have shown unlimited loyalty to the people and to the cause of building communism. Among them are leaders of the Party and government, leaders of Party, government, trade union, and youth league organizations in various regions, advanced workers, collective farmers, and outstanding scientific and cultural workers. Among them are Party members and non-Party members. All of the nominated are candidate representatives of the alliance of communists and non-communists. This is very natural. Because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which leads the people in building communism, represents the interests of all the people. All representatives of the people have grown up under the education of the Communist Party. For example, Pavel Bykov, the candidate representative nominated by the "October" electoral district in Moscow, is a worker who pioneered the high-speed cutting method and a Party member. He is not only proficient in technology himself, but also good at teaching his experience to young workers. Non-Party workers also expressed their intention to vote for him. Alexander Babavin, the candidate representative nominated by the Yaroslavl electoral district, is a train driver who initiated the movement to extend the running distance of locomotives without major repairs and is a non-Party member. He has served on the railway for 45 years and has worked on the same locomotive for 26 years. This locomotive has never undergone major repairs and has traveled more than 1.5 million kilometers, exceeding the quota by more than two times. Party members will also vote for him.

    Welcoming the election, especially the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the voters, has aroused a new upsurge of labor and political enthusiasm among workers, peasants, and intellectuals in Soviet cities and rural areas. In the socialist competition to welcome the election, Soviet workers are discovering and utilizing the potential of industry and are successfully completing production plans. The workers of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Kuznetsk Stalin Iron and Steel Combine completed the February plan ahead of schedule on February 25, producing an additional 2,000 tons of steel, and will produce an additional 3,000 tons by the end of the month. The workers of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace workshop of the Magnitogorsk Stalin Iron and Steel Combine increased production by 3,500 tons over the plan in February. The largest coal mine in Kuzbass named after Kirov has increased its average daily coal production by 500 tons compared with last year, and the miners guarantee to overproduce 26,000 tons of coal ahead of schedule before the election day. In welcoming the election, Soviet agricultural laborers have launched a competition to prepare well for spring plowing and strive to increase production this year, and a large number of young people are volunteering to reclaim new land in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union. In welcoming the election, Soviet public opinion unanimously supports the efforts of the Soviet government at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to ease international tensions and strive to convene a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. The election movement demonstrates the great unity of the Soviet Party, government, and people.

    苏联人民在迎接选举
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联最高苏维埃的选举，将于三月十四日举行。苏联人民以一天比一天高涨的劳动和政治热情迎接它。
    这次苏联最高苏维埃的选举，是继一九三七、一九四六、一九五零年以来的第四次选举。四年为期的苏联最高苏维埃，是用普遍、平等、直接和秘密投票的方式来选举的。它是国家政权的最高机构。它由联盟院和民族院组成，以保证既能反映全苏联劳动者的普遍利益又能反映全苏联各民族的特殊利益。由苏联最高苏维埃选出苏联最高苏维埃主席团——国家的首脑。由苏联最高苏维埃产生苏联部长会议——国家最高行政机构。这些都是在苏联建成社会主义社会，在一九三六年通过新宪法以后，从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的时期的事情。在这以前，当苏联还在社会主义改造的过渡时期，还在社会主义建设时期，在阶级斗争还存在的条件下，苏联国家政权的最高机构是全苏联苏维埃代表大会。为了防止剥削阶级分子钻到高级政权机构中去，它是经过多级选举的。劳动者选举代表到市、乡、村苏维埃和共和国、边疆、州苏维埃代表大会去，从这些苏维埃和苏维埃代表大会再选举代表到全苏联苏维埃代表大会去。为了巩固工人阶级在政权中的领导作用，当时在城市二万五千选民选一个代表，在乡村十二万五千选民选一个代表。全苏联苏维埃代表大会选出由联盟院和民族院组成的中央执行委员会，由中央执行委员会再选出中央执行委员会主席团和产生国家最高行政机构——苏联人民委员会。因此苏联国家政权的最高机构是从建设社会主义时期的三个环节——全苏联苏维埃代表大会、中央执行委员会、中央执行委员会主席团，发展到建设共产主义时期的两个环节——苏联最高苏维埃和最高苏维埃主席团。
    苏维埃政权是由共产党带头的工人阶级领导的劳动者的政权。为人民服务的苏联最高苏维埃，根据苏联共产党的路线，决定着国家大事。本届苏联最高苏维埃，像历届一样，完成了巨大的工作。例如：一九五三年三月，斯大林同志逝世以后，苏联最高苏维埃第四次会议批准了苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志所提的政府人员名单。这次会议也通过了调整政府各部机构的法令。这个法令改进和加强了国家管理工作，缩减了行政开支，使许多专门人材从办公室下到生产中去。这样，在一九五三年为国家节约了六十五亿卢布。苏联最高苏维埃每年讨论和批准保证苏联国民经济发展的国家预算。一九五三年八月，苏联最高苏维埃会议通过了减低农业税的法令。这个法令增加了苏联农民的收入，提高了他们增产的热情。苏联人民现在所大力完成的巨大任务——要在两三年内大大地增加日用品的生产，首先进一步发展供应粮食和原料的农业的生产——就是由马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上提出的。
    所以，爱护自己国家，爱护自己政权的苏联人民，像办全国大喜事似的迎接苏联最高苏维埃的选举。选举运动在选举日前两个月就开始了。苏联最高苏维埃主席团按照宪法颁布了选举日和选举区以后，接着根据各社会组织和团体的提名，批准了以全苏工会中央理事会所提的以什维尔尼克为主席的中央选举委员会名单。然后在各选举区，各社会组织和团体的会议上，劳动者的会议上，候选代表的提名开始了。接着，登记候选代表；举行候选代表与选民的会面。苏联共产党中央委员会发表了告全体选民书，号召他们都参加选举，都投票选举共产党员与非党员的联盟的候选代表。苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和全苏工会中央理事会也发表了同样性质的告青年选民和职工选民的信。
    在迎接选举的运动中，全苏联进行着巨大的宣传鼓动工作。几百万人直接参加各地选举委员会、鼓动站、宣传队。仅在莫斯科就设着一千四百个鼓动站，近三十万鼓动员在选民中进行着群众工作。选举成为苏联几千种报刊和广大广播网在这一个时期的宣传中心。宣传鼓动队伍大力向选民宣传和解释苏联共产党和政府的国内政策和对外政策，苏联宪法原则和社会主义社会制度和国家制度的优越性。宣传鼓动工作要求做到使每个选民都了解苏联共产党九月全会的决议和最近以来党和政府的决定。对于初次参加选举的青年选民，还要宣传选举法和选举制度的原则。这些宣传鼓动工作把政治原则与工业、农业、文化建设的具体任务联系起来。在候选代表提名以后，宣传鼓动工作进入了介绍候选代表的紧要时期。介绍人和鼓动员使选民认识候选代表的社会政治活动和工作情形。介绍候选代表，这是为了保证把优秀人物选举到国家政权的最高机关去，而他们的榜样同时也教育着人们。
    所有的被提名的候选代表，都是对人民对建设共产主义的事业，表现着无限忠诚的人物。他们当中有党和政府的领袖，各地党、政府、工会、青年团组织的领导者，先进的工人、集体农民，出色的科学和文化工作者。他们当中有党员也有非党员。所有被提名的都是共产党员与非党员的联盟的候选代表。这是很自然的。因为领导人民进行共产主义建设的苏联共产党，代表着全体人民的利益。所有人民的代表，都是在共产党的教育下成长起来的。例如，莫斯科市“十月”选区所提的候选代表巴维尔·贝科夫，是首创高速切削法的工人，是党员。他不仅自己精通技术，而且善于把自己的经验教授给青年工人，非党的工人也表示要投票选举他。雅罗斯拉夫市选区提出的候选代表亚历山大·巴巴维英，是发起不用大修理地延长机车行驶路程的运动的火车司机，是非党员。他在铁路上服务了四十五年，在同一机车上工作了二十六年，这机车从来没有大修理，已经走了一百五十万公里以上，超过定额两倍。党员也将投票选举他。
    迎接选举，特别是苏共中央告选民书，在苏联城市和农村引起了工人、农民、知识分子的劳动和政治热情的新高涨。在迎接选举的社会主义竞赛中，苏联工人发掘和利用着工业的潜在力，顺利地完成着生产计划。库兹涅茨克斯大林钢铁联合工厂第一平炉间工人在二月二十五日提前完成了二月份计划，额外多炼了二千吨钢，到月底还要多炼三千吨。马格尼托哥尔斯克斯大林钢铁联合工厂第三平炉间工人在二月份超计划增产了三千五百吨钢。库兹巴斯以基洛夫为名的最大煤矿每昼夜平均采煤量比去年增加五百吨，矿工们保证到选举日前超计划多采二万六千吨煤。在迎接选举中，苏联农业劳动者展开了很好地准备春耕争取今年增产的竞赛，大批青年志愿到苏联东部地区开垦新地。在迎接选举中，苏联舆论一致拥护苏联政府在柏林四国外长会议上所作的缓和国际紧张局势和争取召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的努力。选举运动表现着苏联党、政府和人民的伟大的团结。
