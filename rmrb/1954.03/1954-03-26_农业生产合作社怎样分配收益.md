How Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives Distribute Income
Wang Licheng, Ou Haibin

The distribution of income in agricultural producers' cooperatives is what the members care about most. Farmers join the cooperative basically because the agricultural producers' cooperative has a "good direction and high yield," hoping that joining the cooperative will "produce more grain and increase income." After joining the cooperative, they want to know how much they can produce and how much they can distribute, and whether they can increase their income. Those with more and better land and more and stronger labor are afraid of suffering losses after joining the cooperative, and those with less and weaker labor are also afraid of reducing their income after joining the cooperative. Some people say: "We'll work if we get a big share, and we'll quit if we get a small share." If the distribution is appropriate, the income of the members will generally increase, and their enthusiasm will be greatly improved. Some members say: "Even if you beat me with a big stick, I won't leave the cooperative."

The income distribution is also what the vast majority of farmers outside the cooperative pay the most attention to. If the production of the agricultural producers' cooperative increases and the income of the members increases, they will be willing to join the cooperative or form new agricultural producers' cooperatives.

**It must conform to the transitional nature of the agricultural producers' cooperative**

How exactly do agricultural producers' cooperatives distribute income?

The resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives points out: "When solving the distribution problem of cooperatives, it must be understood that the characteristics of the existing form of agricultural producers' cooperatives are that it is a transitional form of cooperative towards complete socialization, containing two aspects of private and cooperative nature. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt some flexible and diverse transitional distribution methods." Agricultural producers' cooperatives have land shares. Although the land is used uniformly, it is still privately owned, and a certain amount of remuneration must be distributed; many other means of production, such as draft animals and farm implements, are still privately owned, and can also be obtained through rent, employment and other means. A certain amount of remuneration. On the other hand, according to the cooperative nature of agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is also necessary to adopt certain methods of distributing dividends according to the amount and quality of labor, and gradually accumulate some public property (including public accumulation funds and public means of production). According to the transitional nature of agricultural producers' cooperatives, with the gradual improvement of the cooperative's production level, labor efficiency, and the consciousness of the masses, labor remuneration may gradually increase; after a certain period, the method of complete payment according to work can be adopted according to the willingness of the members. However, this must be done step by step, and it must be done when everyone is truly willing. Now, the labor, land, livestock, and farm implements of each household in the cooperative must receive a certain amount of remuneration.

How is the distribution work done? How to do it well? The most important thing is to see if it conforms to its private, cooperative, and transitional nature. Currently, the most important issue is the proportion of dividends for labor, land, and other means of production.

**To ensure that those with strong labor and more land do not suffer losses**

How should the dividend ratio be determined? The principles are: First, the interests of each member should be taken care of, and the distribution results should ensure that the general members do not suffer losses; on the basis of continuous increase in production, the members should be able to generally increase some income than before joining the cooperative, and increase it every year. Generally speaking, poor peasants have less land and other means of production, and relatively more labor; middle peasants have more land and other means of production, and relatively less labor. The distribution ratio determined by the cooperative should be calculated to ensure that the income of poor and middle peasants is not reduced; if the cooperative increases production, the income of both poor and middle peasants should be increased. Second, the increase or decrease in labor remuneration or land remuneration in distribution should generally change gradually with the growth of the production level. In agricultural producers' cooperatives, it is absolutely not allowed to arbitrarily increase the remuneration for land and other means of production and suppress labor remuneration, so as to create disguised exploitation. However, it is also inappropriate to blindly and hastily increase labor remuneration regardless of the development of production level and other related conditions; that will reduce the income of some middle peasants with more means of production, harm their enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation and their enthusiasm for expanding production investment, which is detrimental to the improvement of the entire cooperative's production. If production cannot be developed well, it will not benefit all members.

How can these principles be correctly implemented? First, the specific economic conditions and requirements of each member must be considered. The specific economic conditions of each member are not completely the same, for example, the strength of labor and the level of technology are different, the amount, quality, distance, and proximity of the land are different, the amount, size, strength, and weakness of livestock are different, the amount and condition of farm implements are different, the ability to invest is different, and the conditions for engaging in sideline production and other production activities are different. Therefore, the requirements reflected in the distribution are also different. When determining the ratio, it is necessary to try out the accounts with different ratios for the actual situation of each household in advance, compare it with his past income, compare it with the income of other members, and compare it with the income of mutual aid group members and individual farmers with similar conditions. After such careful and repeated trials, a more appropriate distribution ratio can be found. After democratic discussion by the members, a ratio that everyone can accept can be determined. Second, the general characteristics of the cooperative must be considered. In some cooperatives, the labor force and the amount of land occupied by each household are roughly the same, and it is possible to increase labor remuneration faster; in some cooperatives, the labor force and the amount of land occupied by each household vary greatly, then the increase in labor remuneration should be more cautious. At the same time, the production level and other related conditions of the cooperative must also be considered. Generally speaking, in the case of a large increase in production, the proportion of labor remuneration can be gradually increased. In short, each district, each township, each village, and each cooperative should be allowed to have different distribution ratios. It is not allowed to mechanically copy, force uniformity, or subjectively draw a circle and restrict it. It should also be noted that when trying out various different distribution ratios, a very small number of households may be difficult to take care of from the general ratio. For example, members who have lost too much work due to illness or other special reasons, and elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed people who have no labor force or only half of the labor force. These households can be taken care of from the public welfare fund, or solved by voluntary mutual assistance among the members, and they should be taken care of at any time in the allocation of light work in the daily labor process. It is inappropriate to revise the distribution ratio because of these few households.

What method should be adopted to stipulate the dividend ratio? At present, the distribution methods adopted by agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places can be mainly divided into two types: one is to distribute income according to the proportion of labor and land, and the income of land and labor increases as the output increases; the other is to fix the rent of land, and all the increase in output is distributed to labor, and the actual amount of land dividends does not increase. There is also an intermediate form: the proportion of dividends distributed by labor for the increased part of production is larger, and the rest is distributed according to the general proportion. These methods are not rigid and fixed, and each cooperative can flexibly use them according to its own conditions. This method can be used this year, and another method can be used next year. As long as everyone is willing and it is conducive to the development of production, it is possible.

How should the remuneration for the members' livestock and farm implements be calculated? At the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, generally speaking, it is more appropriate to adopt the method of renting to the cooperative, and the members will evaluate a certain rent; if it is damaged, the cooperative will compensate or repair it. It is also possible to convert it into a share and distribute dividends. The dividend ratio can also be determined by democratic discussion among the members. Some cooperatives have adopted the method of converting the price to public ownership, and the cooperative will pay the price in installments. This method cannot be widely used yet. If the cooperative pays money in one or two years, it will reduce the income of some members; if the delay is too long, the original owner will be dissatisfied. If the members are completely willing and the cooperative can afford it without reducing the income of the members, this method is of course feasible. The price or dividend ratio of livestock and farm implements should also be fair and reasonable. On the one hand, it should not be too high, becoming a disguised exploitation of the general members; on the other hand, it should not make those who have livestock and farm implements suffer losses, hindering their enthusiasm for investment.

**The amount of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund to be retained should be appropriate**

Whether the income distribution is appropriate, in addition to the appropriate distribution ratio of labor, land, and other means of production, the proportion of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund to be retained should also be appropriate. Generally speaking, the proportion of public accumulation fund and public welfare fund to be withdrawn is appropriate at 1% to 5% of the total income of the entire cooperative each year. When determining how much public accumulation fund and public welfare fund to retain, it must be kept in mind that they are very important parts of the socialist component in agricultural producers' cooperatives. On the one hand, it is wrong to expand them too hastily regardless of the conditions, because that may reduce the personal income of the members and affect the consolidation of the cooperative. On the other hand, it is also wrong not to accumulate when there are conditions for accumulation or to accumulate very little when there are conditions for appropriately more accumulation. It must be known that if there is more public accumulation fund, the cooperative can increase production investment and do big things, greatly increasing production; if there is more public welfare fund, it can carry out welfare undertakings that cannot be done by individual households, and also enable each member to get help and overcome difficulties when they encounter unexpected misfortunes.

**It must go through a democratic and detailed discussion by all members**

Who should do the distribution work? It is not for the working cadres to act arbitrarily, nor is it enough for a few cadres in the cooperative to discuss it. Distribution is a major event for all members, and every member must actively participate in it. If everyone participates, it can ensure that the distribution is indeed fair and reasonable; at the same time, in the process of everyone's joint discussion, the ability to jointly handle everyone's affairs and the ideological awareness of collectivism can be improved a step further, and the ideological understanding of labor being glorious and labor creating value can be improved a step further. When it is about to be harvested, various accounts must be cleared and announced, and reviewed and corrected by all members; at the same time, the cadres must correctly and comprehensively explain the distribution principles to everyone, dispel some ideological concerns of the members, and analyze the fundamental reasons for increasing production. Then, appropriately estimate the harvest, everyone democratically discusses and formulates a budget distribution plan, uses the originally stipulated distribution ratio for trial calculation, and sees if the originally stipulated distribution ratio is reasonable. If it is reasonable, it will be distributed according to the originally stipulated distribution ratio. If it is unreasonable, the appropriate distribution ratio will be re-stipulated, and some specific problems will be proposed and solved at the same time (such as: problems left over from the establishment of the cooperative, the members' fertilizer discount problem, the problem of adjusting the public accumulation fund withdrawal ratio; and some problems about deducting next year's production investment, etc.).

During the harvest process, it can be divided as it is harvested. Cooperatives that mainly produce grain should pay special attention to fairly resolving the adjustment of grain quality and dryness among the members of each household, and the collocation of other crops and sideline products. A small amount of "contingency grain" should be left during grain distribution, ready to make up for it.

After the harvest is over, it is necessary to clear each household's accounts, calculate how much each household should actually distribute, how much should be supplemented, and how much should be refunded, and clear them up in time.

In the entire distribution process, no matter what problem is solved, it must go through democratic discussion by the members; everyone must make a general summary of the year's production in the distribution process. On the one hand, through the comparison of various specific facts, further understand the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, understand the importance of labor, and on the other hand, find out the shortcomings and difficulties that should be overcome, work together with one heart, and continue to move forward.

    农业生产合作社怎样分配收益王立诚　欧海滨
    农业生产合作社的收益分配是社员们最关心的。农民入社，基本上就是为了农业生产合作社“方向好，产量高”，图入社能“多打粮食，增加收入”。他们入社以后想早知道究竟能打多少，分多少，是不是能增加收入。土地多土地好的和劳力多劳力强的都怕入社以后吃亏，劳力少劳力弱的也怕入社以后减少收入。有些人说：“分多了就干，分少了就散。”分的恰当，社员一般收入有所增加，积极性就大大提高，有的社员说：“用大杠子打也不出社了。”
    收益分配也是广大社外农民最注意的。农业生产合作社的生产增加了，社员的收入增加了，他们也就愿意入社，或者成立新的农业生产合作社。
    要符合农业生产合作社的过渡的性质
    农业生产合作社究竟是怎样分配收益的呢？
    中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议中指出：“在解决合作社的分配问题时，必须了解到现有形式的农业生产合作社的特点，它是走向完全社会主义化的过渡形式的合作社，包含有两方面的性质即私有的和合作的性质。因此，也就必须采取一些灵活的和多样的过渡的分配办法。”农业生产合作社是土地入股的，土地虽然统一使用，但是仍然是私有的，还要分取一定的报酬；其他的许多生产资料，像耕畜、农具等，也仍然是私有的，并且通过吃租、雇用等方式，也可以得到一定的报酬。另一方面，根据农业生产合作社的合作的性质，也要采取一定的按劳动的多少好坏分红的办法，还要逐渐地积累一些公有财产（包括公积金和公有的生产资料）。根据农业生产合作社的过渡的性质，随着社的生产水平、劳动效率和群众觉悟的逐步提高，劳动报酬就可能逐步增长；到一定时期以后，就可以根据社员们的自愿，采取完全按劳取酬的办法。不过，这要一步一步地来，要到大家真正自愿的时候才这么办。现在社里各家的劳力、土地和牲口、农具都是要得到一定的报酬的。
    分配工作怎样做？怎样做好？顶重要的就是看是不是合乎它的私有的、合作的、过渡的性质。当前来说，顶重要的就是劳力、土地和其他生产资料分红的比例问题。
    要使劳力强的、土地多的都不吃亏
    分红比例该怎样确定呢？原则是：第一、应该照顾到每个社员的利益，分配的结果要使一般社员都不吃亏；在不断增加生产的基础上，还要使社员能够比入社以前普遍增加一些收入，并且年年有些增加。一般地说，贫农的土地和其他生产资料较少，劳力相对地较多；中农的土地及其他生产资料较多，劳力相对地较少。社里确定的分配比例，算下来要使贫农中农都不至于减少了收入；社里增加了生产，要使贫农中农都能增加收入。第二、分配中劳动报酬或土地报酬的提高或降低，一般应随着生产水平的增长而逐步改变。在农业生产合作社中，决不允许任意提高土地及其他生产资料的报酬，压低劳动报酬，以至造成变相的剥削。但是，不顾生产水平的发展及别的有关的条件，盲目地、过急地提高劳动报酬，也是不恰当的；那就会使一部分生产资料较多的中农收入减少，伤害了他们的互助合作的积极性和扩大生产投资的积极性，对整个社的生产的提高是不利的。如果生产不能好好发展，对全体社员也都是没有好处的。
    怎样才能正确地实行这些原则呢？第一，要考虑每一个社员的具体经济条件和要求。各个社员的具体经济条件是不会完全一样的，例如劳力强弱、技术高低不同，土地多少、好坏、远近不同，牲口多少、大小、壮弱不同，农具多少、新旧不同，投资能力大小不同，经营副业等生产活动的条件也不同，因此，他们在分配中所反映出来的要求也不一样。在确定比例的时候，事先需要就每一户的实际情况用各种不同的比例试算一下账，比较一下他在过去的收入，比较一下别的社员的收入，比较一下条件差不多的互助组员和个体农民的收入。这样慎重地反复试算后，就可以找出比较恰当的分配比例。再经过社员民主讨论，就能确定一个大家都能接受的比例。第二，要考虑社里的一般特点。有的社各户社员的劳动力和占有土地的数量都大体相当，就有可能将劳动报酬提高得快一些；有的社各户社员的劳动力和占有土地数量相差较大，那么劳动报酬的提高就要更慎重一些。同时，还要考虑社里的生产水平和别的有关的条件。一般地说，在增产较多的情况下，劳动报酬的比例可以逐渐提高。总之，要允许每一个区、每一个乡、每一个村、每一个社有不同的分配比例，不能生搬硬套，强求一致，或主观主义地划个圈圈箍起来。也要注意到，在试算各种不同的分配比例时，可能有极少数的户很难从一般的比例上照顾解决。比如因为害病或其他特殊原因误工太多的社员和老弱孤寡，没有劳力或只有半劳力的户等等。对于这些户可以从公益金中照顾，或由社员自愿互济解决，并且要在日常劳动过程中在轻活分配上随时照顾他们。因为这样一些少数户而修改分配比例是不恰当的。
    采取什么方式规定分红比例呢？目前各地农业生产合作社采用的分配方式，主要的可以分为两种：一种是劳力、土地按比例分配收益，产量增加了土地、劳力的收入都增加；一种是土地固定租额，产量增加了都归劳力分配，土地分红的实际数目不增加。还有一种中间形式：增产的部分劳力分的红的比例大一些，其余的按一般的比例来分。这些办法都不是死板的、固定的，各个社可以按照自己的条件灵活运用。今年用这个办法，明年也可以换别的办法。只要大家都自愿，对发展生产有利，就可以。
    对于社员的牲口、农具，怎样算报酬呢？社初办的时候，一般地说，采取租借给社里的方式，由社员大家评定出一定的租金，是比较合适的；损坏了由社里赔偿或者修理。折成价钱入股分红，也可以。分红的比例也可以由社员民主讨论确定。有的社采取了折价归公的办法，由社里分期给代价。这种办法还不能普遍采用。社里一两年给钱，会使一些社员收入减少；延期太久，原主又会不满意。如果社员完全自愿而社里又出得起、不降低社员们的收入，这办法当然也是可以实行的。牲口农具的代价或分红比例，也要公平合理，一方面不能太高，成为对一般社员的变相剥削；一方面也不能使有牲口、农具的人吃亏，妨碍他们投资的积极性。
    留公积金、公益金的数目要适当
    收益分配得是不是恰当，除了劳力、土地和别的生产资料的分配比例要适当以外，留公积金和公益金的比例也要适当。一般来说，目前公积金和公益金的抽存比例以每年全社总收入的百分之一到百分之五为合适。在确定公积金、公益金留多少的时候，必须想着它们是农业生产合作社中社会主义成分的很重要的部分。一方面，不顾条件过急地扩大是不对的，因为那就有可能使社员个人收入减少，影响到社的巩固。另一方面，在有条件积累时不积累或者在有条件适当地较多地积累而很少积累，也是不对的。要知道，公积金多了，社里就可以增加生产投资，可以办大事情，大大增加生产；公益金多了，就可以举办一家一户办不起的福利事业，还可以使每一个社员在遭受到意外的不幸事故的时候都能得到帮助，渡过困难。
    要经过全体社员民主的细致的讨论
    分配工作由谁来做呢？不是由工作干部独断独行，也不是社裹的几个干部商量一下就算数。分配是全体社员的大事，是要每个社员都积极参加的。大家都参加，就能保证分配得确实公平合理；同时，还可以在大家共同商议的过程中把共同办大家务的能力和集体主义的思想觉悟提高一步，把劳动光荣，劳动创造价值的思想认识提高一步。在快要收获的时候，就要清理和公布各种账目，由全体社员审查订正；同时，干部要向大家正确地全面地讲解分配原则，打消社员们的一些思想顾虑，分析增加生产的根本原因。接着，就适当地估计收成，大家民主讨论，制订预算分配的方案，用原来规定的分配比例进行试算，看看原来规定的分配比例是否合理，合理，就按照原来规定的分配比例分配，不合理，就重新规定适当的分配比例，同时提出并解决一些具体问题（如：建社时所遗留下来的问题，社员肥料折价问题，调整公积金抽存比例的问题；以及关于扣除明年生产投资的一些问题等等）。
    在收获过程中，可以随打随分。以产粮食为主的社，特别要注意公平地解决各户社员间粮食成色、干潮的调剂，和其他作物及副产品的搭配。分粮中应留下少部分“机动粮”，准备找补。
    收获完了以后，就要清结各户账目，算出每户应实分多少，应补应退多少，及时清补。
    在整个分配过程中，无论解决什么问题，都必须经过社员民主讨论；大家要在分配过程中对一年的生产大体上作个总结。一方面通过各种具体事实的对比，进一步认识农业生产合作社的优越性，认识劳动的重要性，一方面找出应当克服的缺点和困难，同心协力，继续前进。
