To promote the socialist transformation of agriculture and gain experience in mechanized farming, the East China region plans to build fifteen new agricultural machinery stations this year. Among them, Shandong Province will have nine, and Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces will each have three.

All localities attach great importance to the establishment of agricultural machinery stations. They are currently surveying sites for station construction and preparing for necessary infrastructure construction. Responsible cadres for each station have been assigned in a short period, and other cadres in machinery, agronomy, finance, and other fields are being actively transferred. To effectively manage agricultural machinery stations, the main cadres in charge of station construction from each province have gone to the Ministry of Agriculture for short-term study, absorbing the experience of old stations in station construction and contract farming.

The contract farming targets of agricultural machinery stations are mainly agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural machinery stations that have made earlier preparations for construction can participate in spring plowing. The Guangbei Agricultural Machinery Station, established on the basis of the state-owned Guangbei Mechanical Farm service team, plans to plow 28,500 mu of land for farmers, harrow 18,000 mu, cultivate 4,000 mu, sow 3,000 mu, harvest 2,500 mu with combine harvesters, and mechanically irrigate 35,000 tons. Other stations will strive to carry out summer plowing for agricultural production cooperatives. (Chen Jinyu)

In addition: Songjiang Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, in order to adapt to the needs of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and further improve agricultural production, has decided to select areas with a good foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, sufficient water sources but difficult manual irrigation, and urgent demands from the masses in Songjiang and Jinshan counties to focus on the trial operation of three pumping stations. The Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Songjiang Prefectural Administration sent cadres to Changlou Township, Songjiang County, as early as the end of last year to conduct investigations and research on mutual aid and cooperation, water source rivers, and the natural environment, and to conduct preliminary discussions on station construction among the masses, listening to and studying their opinions. The masses generally expressed their welcome. Now the relevant leaders are compiling charts, designing the dredging and excavation of ditches and rivers, planning the allocation of cadres and equipment, and calculating costs and burdens; and further organizing the masses to dredge and excavate ditches.

    华东区将新建农业机器站十五处
    江苏省松江专区重点试办三个抽水机站
    为促进农业的社会主义改造与吸取机械耕种的经验，华东地区计划在今年新建农业机器站十五处。其中山东省九处，江苏、安徽两省各三处。
    各地对建立农业机器站工作都非常重视，现正在勘察建站地址，准备进行必要的基本建设，各站的负责干部已在短期内配齐，其他机务、农艺、财务等干部正在积极抽调中。为了切实办好农业机器站，各省建站的主要干部已到中央农业部进行短期的学习，吸收老站的建站和代耕经验。
    农业机器站的代耕对象，以农业生产合作社为主。建站准备工作进行得较早的农业机器站，即可参加春耕。以国营广北机械农场服务队为基础而建立起来的广北农业机器站，计划为农民耕地二万八千五百亩，耙地一万八千亩，中耕四千亩，播种三千亩，联合收割机收割二千五百亩，机械灌溉三万五千吨。其他各站，将争取为农业生产合作社进行伏耕。（陈锦余）
    又讯：江苏省松江专区为适应互助合作运动发展的需要，进一步提高农业生产，决定在松江、金山两县境内，选择互助合作基础较好、水源充足但人力灌溉困难、群众又有迫切要求的地区，重点试办三个抽水机站。中共松江地委与松江专署早在去年年底便派出干部，到松江县长溇乡，就互助合作、水源河道、自然环境等方面进行调查研究，并在群众中进行建站的初步酝酿，听取与研究群众的意见。群众普遍表示欢迎。现在有关领导方面正编制图表，设计沟渠河道的疏通与开挖，筹划干部、器材的配备以及计算成本和负担；并进一步组织群众疏通与开挖沟渠。
