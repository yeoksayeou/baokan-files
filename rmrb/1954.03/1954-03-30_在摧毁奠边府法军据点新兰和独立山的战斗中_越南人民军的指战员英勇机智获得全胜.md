(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 29) The heroic and resourceful commanders and fighters of the Vietnamese People's Army recently achieved a complete victory with flexible tactics in the battles to destroy the two resistance centers in the north of the French invading army's Dien Bien Phu Group stronghold – Xinlan and Duli Mountain.

　　On the afternoon of the 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army, under the cover of artillery fire, began to attack the 3rd Battalion of the French Foreign Legion entrenched in Xinlan. A certain unit's assault team, led by squad leader Han Wenshi, advanced with the mission of removing Bunker No. 3. However, during the movement, they discovered a French army bunker. Han Wenshi immediately dispersed the team into a fan-shaped encirclement. He himself agilely approached the left side of the bunker's exit, using a machine gun to sweep inside and eliminate the French troops in the bunker. Then, they advanced along the trench, capturing three prisoners on the way. They ordered the prisoners to lead the way and walked straight to Bunker No. 3. At that time, the French troops in this bunker were randomly firing machine guns outwards. Han Wenshi threw a hand grenade into the gun hole and then told a French prisoner to shout a message. As a result, the French troops in the bunker came out to surrender. Han Wenshi then led the prisoners to Bunker No. 4, and similarly, after throwing a round of hand grenades at the bunker, he again told the French prisoner to shout a message. As a result, more than 20 French troops in this bunker laid down their weapons. At the end of the battle, Han Wenshi's squad captured a total of 46 French troops alive, and no one in the team was injured or killed.

　　In attacking another support point of Xinlan, the soldier Xian of the second assault group of a certain unit of the People's Army lost contact after rushing into the breakthrough. But he calmly continued to advance along the trench. In a branch trench, he saw a French soldier burying his head and firing a submachine gun. So, he cleverly went around to the side and forced the guy to hand over his gun. Soldier Xian later encountered Zhou, a soldier from another unit who had lost contact. Together, they solved a firing point and shouted a message to make the French troops in a bunker come out and surrender. Later, Soldier Xian caught up with the assault group and advanced together.

　　Another group of People's Army soldiers attacking Xinlan, after blasting the barbed wire, Nguyen Huu Oanh, the leader of the assault group of a certain company, took the lead in rushing into the breakthrough, rapidly and bravely developing into the depths. In less than a quarter of an hour, they captured the highest commanding point of Xinlan – the top of the French army's battalion command post, throwing hand grenades down, then rushing into the command post and forcing the enemy's acting commander, a captain, to surrender.

　　After the People's Army annihilated a French battalion in Xinlan, they attacked another battalion of French troops entrenched in Duli Mountain at 2 a.m. on the 15th. As the charge began, the first squad of the People's Army first inserted into the breakthrough. At that time, several soldiers were wounded by artillery shells, but they still insisted on staying on the front line. Led by the squad leader Tran Ngoc Vien and the deputy squad leader and combat hero Nguyen Van Cac, this squad quickly developed into the depths. The soldiers of the first squad used hand grenades to destroy an enemy recoilless gun, and then occupied the high ground, and then advanced towards the enemy's battalion command post.

　　Another People's Army unit attacked Duli Mountain from the south. Squad leader and assault group leader Tue carried out 65 consecutive explosions, blasting a gap in a layer of barbed wire 104 meters thick in total, and led the soldiers to advance along the trench, successively eliminating several French army firing points. Later, when they reached a place, they saw that there were still French troops holding a machine gun and stubbornly resisting. At this time, several soldiers went around from above the trench to the back of the French troops. Before long, they captured an Algerian soldier. The soldiers then had him shout a message, and all the French troops obediently came out to surrender. By the end of the battle, this assault group had destroyed a total of seven French army firing points and captured 20 French troops alive.

　　In the battle of Duli Mountain, the squad led by combat hero Duong was also the first to enter the depths. This squad encountered a French army firing point on the way. The squad leader tried to attract the fire, and then let several soldiers quietly approach the firing point and destroy it with grenades and hand grenades. This squad successively destroyed three machine gun nests while continuing to advance. When approaching the last machine gun nest, a grenade was suddenly thrown out from inside. A soldier immediately threw in a hand grenade. They only heard someone shout in Thai language and then fell silent. So, this soldier shouted loudly in Thai: "If you don't come out again, I'll pull the mine!" After shouting, a Thai puppet soldier rushed out first, followed by more than a dozen French soldiers. At the end of the battle, the squad of combat hero Duong captured a total of 59 French troops, seized seven light and heavy machine guns, and suffered no casualties.

    在摧毁奠边府法军据点新兰和独立山的战斗中
    越南人民军的指战员英勇机智获得全胜
    【新华社北越二十九日电】英勇机智的越南人民军的指挥员和战斗员，最近在摧毁法国侵略军奠边府集团据点北面的两个抵抗中心——新兰和独立山的战斗中，以灵活的战术取得了全胜。
    十三日下午，越南人民军在炮火掩护下开始向困守新兰的法军外籍军团第三营进攻。某部突击队在小队长汉文诗带领下前进，任务是拔除第三号碉堡。但是他们在运动中发现了一个法军掩蔽部，汉文诗立即把队伍散开形成扇形包围圈，他自己敏捷地接近掩蔽部出口的左侧，用机枪向里扫射，消灭了掩蔽部里的法军。接着，他们顺着交通壕前进，在路上抓到三个俘虏；他们就叫俘虏带路，一直走到了第三号碉堡跟前。当时，这碉堡里的法军正胡乱地用机枪向外射击。汉文诗向枪眼扔进一个手炮后，就叫一个法国籍俘虏起来喊话，结果碉堡里的法军都出来投降。汉文诗又带着俘虏向第四号碉堡前进，同样地在向这碉堡打了一阵手榴弹之后，又叫那个法国籍俘虏喊话。结果，这个碉堡的二十多名法军都放下了武器。战斗结束，汉文诗小队共生俘法军四十六名，全队没有一人伤亡。
    在攻击新兰另一个支撑点时，人民军某部第二突击组的战士献，在冲进突破口后失掉了联络。但他沉着地沿着交通壕继续向前进。在一条支壕里，他见到一个法国兵埋着头打冲锋枪。于是，他机灵地绕到侧面去，逼着这个家伙交了枪。战士献后来遇到别单位的一个失掉联络的战士周，他们二人共同解决了一个火力点，又喊话使一个掩蔽部的法军出来投降。后来，战士献又赶上了突击组，一同前进。
    进攻新兰的另一支人民军战士们，爆破铁丝网后，某连突击组组长阮有莺带头冲进了突破口，迅速勇猛地向纵深发展。不到一刻钟，他们就攻上了新兰最高的制高点——法军的营指挥所顶上，向下扔手炮，接着冲进了指挥所，逼迫敌上尉代理指挥官投降。
    人民军在新兰歼灭法军一个营之后，又在十五日清晨二时向困守独立山的另一营法军攻击。冲锋发起了，人民军的第一小队首先插入突破口，当时有几个战士被炮弹打伤，但仍坚持不下火线。这个小队在正队长陈玉远和副队长、战斗英雄阮文各带领下，迅速向纵深发展。第一小队的战士们用手炮炸坏敌人一门无后坐力炮，随即攻占了高地，紧接着便向敌人的营指挥所推进。
    另一支人民军部队从南面攻进了独立山。小队长兼突击组长慧，接连进行了六十五次爆破，把一层层共厚一百零四公尺的铁丝网炸开了一个缺口，又带领着战士们顺着交通壕向前发展，接连消灭了法军的几个火力点。后来到一个地方，见到还有法军守着一挺机枪在顽抗。这时，几个战士从交通壕上面绕到法军的背后，不一会，俘掳了一个阿尔及利亚籍士兵，战士们便让他喊话，所有的法军也乖乖地出来投降了。到战斗结束时为止，这个突击组一共摧毁了法军七个火力点，生俘法军二十名。
    在独立山战斗中，战斗英雄杨带领的小队也是最先进入纵深的。这个小队在运动途中遇到法军的一个火力点，小队长就设法吸引住火力，然后让几个战士悄悄地接近火力点，用手榴弹和手炮炸毁了这个火力点。这个小队在继续前进中又接连摧毁了三个机枪巢。当接近最后一个机枪巢时，里面突然投出手榴弹，一个战士马上投进一个手炮，只听得里面有人用泰族话喊叫了一声便不响了。于是，这个战士就用泰族话大声喊：“你们再不出来，我就拉地雷了！”喊话之后，只见一个泰族伪军抢先出来，随后是十多个法国籍士兵。战斗结束后，战斗英雄杨的小队一共俘掳法军五十九名，缴获轻重机枪七挺，而自己无一伤亡。
