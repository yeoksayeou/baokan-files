Two Villages, Two Different Scenes

In eastern Shaanxi, near the confluence of the Wei and Yellow Rivers, are two small villages in Huayin County, facing each other across a river. To the south is Nie Village, and to the north is Chen Village. The farmers of these two villages were once dragged half-dead by the reactionary government. After liberation, with the implementation of land reform, the farmers of both villages were emancipated together. The situations of the two villages were similar, and in some respects, Chen Village was better than Nie Village. However, in recent years, the farmers of Nie Village have been getting better and better off, while most people in Chen Village have become poorer and poorer.

Among the original fifty-eight poor and lower-middle peasant households in Nie Village, thirty-three are now living as middle peasants; only three have more difficult lives because they farm river滩地(river beach land), and suffered consecutive floods last year and the year before; the rest have no worries about food and clothing. In the past few years, the entire village of seventy-one households has added seven head of livestock and two large carts, all but one of which were added by the original poor and lower-middle peasants. Among these poor and lower-middle peasants, twenty-one households built twenty-eight new houses and repaired forty-four old houses. Four middle peasant households built twenty-two new houses. People who used to wear tattered pants and ragged clothes for many years now have new clothes. Last winter alone, the entire village sewed fifteen overcoats. Nie Huaibao, who used to be constantly in debt, is no longer in debt. He had never worn fine cloth clothes in his thirty-odd years, but now he wears cotton clothes and a cotton overcoat made of市布(Shibu - market cloth). His wife, Hua Guiying, had never used soap in her sixteen years of marriage, but now she uses scented soap and towels. Most families have bought thermos bottles, rain boots, flashlights, and enamel basins. Some families even have surplus money and grain; the original thirty poor and lower-middle peasant households and four middle peasant households have deposited 15.39 million yuan in the People's Bank and credit cooperatives. Four middle peasant households and two original poor peasant households sold 3,000 catties of surplus grain to the state.

Chen Village presents a different picture. Of the village's original fifty-seven poor and lower-middle peasant households, only two are living as middle peasants, while fifty-five continue to live with inadequate food and clothing; one middle peasant household has declined into poverty because their crops were flooded for two years, selling a cow and four mu of land, and had to rely on selling green vegetables and peanuts to make a living last winter. The poor peasant Chen Chanwa and his wife sold the two mu of land they were allocated during land reform last year to repay debts. His wife, seeing that there was nothing to eat, recently ran away. The old poor peasant Wang Wenchang fell ill last spring and sold the two rooms he was allocated during land reform, forcing him to live in a thatched hut. The entire village has added only one cow in recent years, and it was bought with a loan. Only ten new houses have been built in the village, and they were built by a few people with relatively comfortable lives. The remaining four wealthy middle peasant households hire long-term laborers and short-term workers, exploiting others.

Two Villages, Two Roads

Why have the two villages experienced such great changes in just a few years? In terms of land area, Chen Village has 491 people and 1,200 mu of land, averaging more than two mu per person; Nie Village has 295 people and 404 mu of land, averaging only about one and one-third mu per person. In terms of land quality, although all of Nie Village's 400-plus mu are irrigated land, while Chen Village only has 100 mu of irrigated land, by local standards, one mu of irrigated land is equivalent to more than two mu of dry land, so the two villages are not that different. In terms of draught animals and farm tools, the two villages were also similar in the past. Nie Village had eight head of livestock, with each animal responsible for cultivating just over 50 mu of land; Chen Village had twenty-one head of livestock, with each animal responsible for cultivating just over 56 mu of land. Relatively speaking, although Chen Village had slightly fewer livestock than Nie Village, all of Chen Village's livestock belonged to middle peasants; in Nie Village, most people did not have livestock. Chen Village had eight large carts, while Nie Village only had two. This means that the root cause of the changes cannot be found in the original economic conditions of the two villages.

So, where is the root cause? The root cause lies here: one village took the road of getting organized, while the other village has been working independently for several years. Just compare these few things:

In the past, Nie Village, like Chen Village, faced the greatest difficulty in farming: a lack of manure. In the past, many families engaged in side occupations, and no one accumulated fertilizer, so fertilizer relied entirely on the few livestock. Most people did not have livestock, so they had to rely on hair manure and picking up manure. Before 1952, only forty-plus mu of the village's 140-plus mu of cotton could receive more than 2,000 catties of manure. The 200-plus mu of wheat land received no base fertilizer at all, only 3,000 catties of surface fertilizer in the spring, so yields were naturally difficult to improve. However, in the spring of the year before last, Nie Village organized seven mutual aid teams, and all the farmers in the village participated, which solved the manure problem. The mutual aid teams selected more than forty young people to carry manure and urine from Tongguan City, carrying more than 3,000 loads in one spring, universally applying top dressing to more than 200 mu of wheat land and applying 2-3,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu to more than 100 mu of cotton land. This added up to more than twice as much fertilizer as in the past.

In order to improve farming techniques, all seven mutual aid teams subscribed to a newspaper, regularly studying and discussing advanced experiences, and technology was greatly improved. In the past, wheat was "ten wheat, nine unweeded," but this spring, the mutual aid teams selected more than forty women to participate in weeding wheat and also selected cotton seeds. This village is close to the Yellow River滩地(river beach land), and strong winds often blow during the wheat harvest, causing the wheat grains of late harvests to fall off. Being organized made work faster, so they were not affected by wind disasters. The crops changed greatly this year, with wheat yielding 210 catties per mu, more than double the average yield in the township, and was rated as a second-class high-yield village in the county. Cotton land also yielded more than 100 catties of ginned cotton per mu, more than double the average yield in the township and more than 30% higher than the county's average yield per mu. Last year, the seven mutual aid teams learned from Shi Anfu's experience in high wheat yields, selected "Bima No. 1" wheat seeds, and implemented reasonable close planting, as well as winter hoeing and winter irrigation. As a result, this year, the entire village's 164 mu of wheat yielded an average of 495 catties per mu, more than three times the average yield per mu in the township; it was rated as a first-class high-yield wheat village in the county. Seeing that getting organized led to more grain, the seven temporary mutual aid teams have all successively turned into permanent mutual aid teams. Recently, the farmers studied the general line of the state during the transition period and are also discussing the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives!

What about Chen Village? Although eight temporary mutual aid teams were also organized in the spring of the year before last, everyone still wanted to work individually, and no one led properly, so they slowly became empty shells. This made production more difficult. The fifty-seven poor and lower-middle peasant households, farming 7-800 mu of land, only had one cow and no large carts. Nie Village's mutual aid teams could carry manure from the city, with other team members doing the farm work; Chen Village, relying on individual work, naturally could not achieve this. Going to Lin Guan, twenty li away, one person could only carry one load a day, and could not take care of both carrying manure and doing farm work. With little manure and no accumulation of fertilizer, each mu of land could only receive 2,000-plus catties of manure. The village did not subscribe to newspapers or study advanced experiences. Except for two middle peasant households who improved some farming, everyone used old methods. People said that Chen Village was: "No mutual aid, no newspaper subscriptions, old-fashioned farming methods, and low wheat and cotton yields." This is not false at all. The year before last's wheat, because the land was not fertile and the farming was not good, most of the wheat was blown "green dry," yielding only 70-plus catties per mu, with three mu only yielding the same as one mu in Nie Village. Last year, the rainfall was good, yielding 150 catties per mu, but Nie Village had already reached 495 catties.

In previous years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of both villages did not have enough to eat in winter, so they had to go into side occupations, relying on "shoulder poles for food." Now, Nie Village is organized, and labor is well allocated, so they can achieve both agriculture and side occupations. In the winter of the year before last and the spring and winter of last year, the entire village selected more than twenty laborers to work for the Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, packing cotton bales, packing bean buns, and building walls, earning more than 10 million yuan in wages. The team members who went out to engage in side occupations had their farm work done by the team, and there was no delay in planting. Last spring, two widowers who had difficult lives were introduced to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative to sew cotton bales, earning more than 400,000 yuan each in one spring, which solved their livelihood problems. Their farm work was done by the mutual aid team, and there was no delay in planting.

Chen Village was not so lucky. The poor and lower-middle peasants' crops have not been doing well, and their income is not high, so they still rely on "shoulder poles for food." Now, more than fifty poor peasants, with thirty-one households relying on digging river coal, pulling boats, fishing, and selling bamboo wares to make a living. This side occupation has gradually become their "main occupation," further neglecting agricultural production. Eight households who do not engage in side occupations simply go to sell short-term labor.

Two Villages Advance Together

After studying the state's general line during the transition period, the cadres and farmers of Chen Village realized that they had taken the wrong road in the past and were determined to turn back from the wrong road and take the right road. In early February, they invited Nie Huaibao, the leader of the large mutual aid team in Nie Village, to help reorganize the village's original eight mutual aid teams, elected Chen Ansuo as the leader of the large team, and learned from Nie Village to actively improve the mutual aid teams. Farmer Chen Keyou said: "Our village and Nie Village border each other, and people are getting more and more prosperous because they are organized, but we are getting worse and worse. This won't do! We must also take the road of getting organized so that everyone can get rich."

    两个村庄走了两条路
    王德兴
    两个村庄两样光景
    在陕西东部靠近渭河跟黄河汇合点的地方，有两个华阴县属的小村庄，隔河相望。南边是聂家村，北边是陈家村。这两个小村的农民，从前都被反动政府拖得半死不活。解放以后，实行了土地改革，两村的农民一块翻了身。两个村的情况相差不多，有些地方，陈家村比聂家村要好些。可是这几年来，聂家村农民的光景越来越好，陈家村多数人却越过越穷了。
    聂家村原有的五十八户贫雇农当中，已有三十三户过着中农的生活；只有三户因为种的是河滩地，去年和前年又接连遭了水灾，生活比较困难；其余的都不愁吃穿了。几年当中，全村七十一户，共添了七头牲口，两辆大车，里边除一辆大车外，都是原来的贫雇农添的。这些贫雇农中，还有二十
  一户盖了二十八间新房，修了四十四间旧房。四户中农盖了二十二间新房。过去穿了多少年的破裤烂袄的人，现在换了新衣服。光去年冬天，全村就缝了十五件大衣。过去欠债不断的聂怀保，如今再不欠债了。他活了三十多岁没穿过细布衣服，如今穿上了市布棉衣和市布棉大衣。他老婆花桂英和他结婚十六年，没用过肥皂，现在也用上了香皂和毛巾。大多数人家都买下了暖水壶、雨鞋、手电筒、搪瓷脸盆。有的人家还有了余钱余粮；原来的三十户贫雇农和四户中农，在人民银行和信用合作社里存了一千五百三十九万元。四户中农和原来的两户贫农，卖了三千斤余粮给国家。
    陈家村却是另一种光景。全村原有的五十七户贫雇农，除两户过着中农生活外，有五十五户照旧过着少吃没穿的生活；有一户中农因为两年的庄稼被水淹了，已经下降成贫农，他卖掉了一头牛、四亩地，去年冬天只好靠卖青菜和花生来糊口。贫农陈缠娃两口人，为了还债，去年把土地改革时分下的二亩地卖了。老婆见没吃的，最近也跑了。贫农王文昌老汉去年春上害了一场病，把土地改革时分下的两间房卖了，自己只得住草房。全村几年来只添了一头牛，还是用贷款买的。全村只盖了十间新房，也是少数生活较宽裕的人盖的。剩下的四户富裕中农，则雇长工、叫短工，剥削别人。
      两个村庄两条道路
    为什么几年的工夫，两个村竟有这么大的变化呢？论土地数量，陈家村四百九十一口人，一千二百亩地，平均每人有二亩多地；聂家村二百九十五口人，四百零四亩地，平均每八只有一亩三分地。论土地质量，虽然聂家村的四百多亩地都是水地，陈家村只有一百亩水地，可是，按当地平均一亩水地顶二亩多旱地计算，合起来两村也不差上下。论耕畜农具，过去两个村也差不多，聂家村八头牲口，每头牲口担负着五十亩多点的耕地；陈家村二十一头牲口，每个牲口担负着五十六亩多的耕地。比较起来，陈家村虽然比聂家村的牲口少一点，可是两个村的牲口全都是中农的；聂家村没牲口的人还占多数。陈家村有八辆大车，聂家村只有两辆。这就是说，从两个村庄原有的经济条件上找不到变化的根由。
    那么，根由到底在那里呢？根由原来在这里：一个村庄走了组织起来的道路，一个村庄几年来各干各的。不信就从这几件事情上比一比吧：
    过去聂家村也和陈家村一样，做庄稼最大的困难是缺粪。过去许多人家搞副业，没人积肥，粪肥完全靠那几头牲口。多数人又没有牲口，便只好靠毛粪和拾点粪了。一九五二年前，全村一百四十多亩棉花，只有四十多亩能上两千多斤粪。二百多亩麦地，根本不上底粪，只在春季上三千多斤浮粪，这样，产量自然很难提高。可是聂家村在前年春天组织了七个互助组，全村农民都参加了，就把粪的问题解决了。互助组抽出四十多个小伙子，到潼关城里去担粪尿，一春天就担了三千多担，给二百多亩麦地普遍上了追肥，一百多亩棉田每亩上到两三千斤底粪。合起来比过去多上了两倍多粪。
    为了改进耕作技术，七个互助组都订了一份报纸，经常学习、讨论先进经验，技术有很大的改进。过去的小麦是“十麦九不锄”，这年春天，互助组里抽出了四十多个妇女参加锄麦，还选了棉种。这村离黄河滩近，每年收麦时常刮大风，收迟的麦子常叫风吹落麦颗。组织起来做活快，就没受风灾。这年的庄稼大变样，小麦每亩收到二百一十斤，比全乡平均产量高一倍多，被评成全县二等丰产村。棉地每亩也收到一百多斤皮棉，比全乡平均产量高一倍多，比全县每亩平均产量高百分之三十多。去年七个互助组学习了史安福的小麦丰产经验，选了“碧蚂一号”麦种，实行了合理密植，又做到了冬锄、冬灌。结果，这年全村一百六十四亩小麦，每亩平均收到四百九十五斤，比全乡每亩平均产量高三倍多；被评为全县一等小麦丰产村。大家看到组织起来多打粮，七个临时互助组又都先后转成常年互助组了。最近农民们学了国家过渡时期的总路线，还商量着建立农业生产合作社呢！
    陈家村呢？在前年春天，虽然也组织了八个临时互助组，可是大家仍旧想单干，又没人好好领导，慢慢就成了空架子。这样，生产上困难就大了。五十七户贫雇农，种着七、八百亩地，却只有
  一头牛，连个大车也没有。聂家村互助组能到城里担粪，庄稼有别的组员做；陈家村靠单干自然闹不成，去临关二十里，一个人一天只能担一趟，顾了担粪，顾不了庄稼活，粪少又不积肥，每亩地只能上两千多斤粪。村里不订报，也不学习先进经验，除过两户中农改进了一些作务，大家都用旧办法。人们说陈家村是：“不互助、不订报，做庄稼老一套，麦棉产量提不高。”这话一点也不假。前年的小麦，因为地不壮，作务又不好，大部分小麦叫风吹“青干”了，每亩只打了七十多斤，三亩只能顶上聂家村一亩的产量。去年雨水好，每亩打了一百五十斤，可是聂家村却已打到四百九十五斤。
    往年，两个村的贫雇农，冬季不够吃，只得往副业行里钻，靠“扁担吃饭”。现在聂家村组织起来，劳力搭配得好，能做到农业副业两不误，前年冬天和去年春冬两季，全村抽出二十多个劳力，给四区供销合作社打棉花包、装豆包、打墙等等，挣了一千多万元的工资。出去搞副业的组员，庄稼有组里调配劳力做，没有误下。去年春上，有两户鳏寡生活困难，就把他们介绍到供销合作社缝棉花包，一春每人挣了四十多万元，解决了生活困难。他们的庄稼由互助组代耕，也没误下。
    陈家村就不行了，贫雇农的庄稼一直做不好，收入不多，照旧靠“扁担吃饭”。现在五十多户贫苦农民，有三十一户靠挖河炭、拉船、打鱼、贩卖竹器过活。这副业就渐渐变成了他们的“正业”，把农业生产越发丢到一边去了。有八户不搞副业的就干脆去卖短工。
      两个村庄一同前进
    经过国家过渡时期总路线的学习，陈家村的干部和农民，认识到自己过去走错了路，决心从错路上回过头来，走正路。二月初旬，便邀请聂家村互助组大组长聂怀保帮助，把全村原来八个互助组整顿了一下，推选陈安锁当大组长，向聂家村学习，积极搞好互助组。农民陈克有说：“咱们村里和聂家村连畔种地，人家组织起来，日子越过越好，咱们却越过越烂，这不成！咱们也要走组织起来的道路，让大家都富裕起来。”
