    In the past year, China's statistical work has made great progress. First, statistical institutions above the provincial and municipal levels have been largely established nationwide, and statistical institutions in various business departments have also been strengthened compared to the past. A unified national statistical reporting system and statistical accounting methods have been initially established. This has effectively overcome the chaotic phenomena in statistical work in the past, enabling statistical work to be carried out in a planned and systematic manner. Second, various important data from various sectors of the national economy during the recovery period, especially in 1952, have been collected and organized, providing the statistical data necessary for the state to formulate long-term and annual plans, and beginning to exert the function of statistics in inspecting the implementation of national plans. Third, according to the Government Administration Council's "Instructions on Cleaning Up Existing Survey and Statistical Forms and Prohibiting the Random Issuance of Survey and Statistical Forms," combined with the anti-"Five Excesses" movement in various regions, survey and statistical forms were cleaned up nationwide, some impractical or repetitive and wasteful survey and statistical forms were abolished, and some survey and statistical forms that still needed to be implemented were revised and simplified. On this basis, a strict reporting approval system was established. This has greatly overcome the decentralism in statistical work, reduced the burden on grassroots cadres, especially rural cadres, and improved the quality of statistical data.

    However, the current state of survey and statistical work in our country is still far from meeting the needs of national construction. As everyone knows, our country's various construction tasks are developing in a planned and proportionate manner, following the basic economic laws of socialism. However, how can we formulate correct plans and appropriately arrange various economic proportions? In addition to correctly reflecting the requirements of the basic economic laws of socialism in the plans, one of the main methods is to establish and strengthen scientific statistical work. Through statistics, the current state of objective things, the process of movement are recorded, organized, and analyzed to discover regularity, to study the level, direction, and speed of social and economic development, as well as the relationships between various proportions, thereby providing a reliable basis necessary for formulating plans. From the above requirements, the quantity of our current statistical data cannot meet the needs of planning work, and the quality is not high; there is still a lack of scientific and systematic organization and research of the existing data, and the arrangement and requirements of statistical work are not entirely practical. Therefore, according to the needs of national planned construction, striving to improve statistical work is still an important task at present.

    Since statistics are the basis of planning, statistical agencies at all levels must take serving planning as their primary and fundamental task. This requires learning from the advanced experience of Soviet statistics work, combined with China's specific situation, and steadily, with emphasis, and gradually establishing scientific statistical work suitable for national management, the formulation, and inspection of national plans, based on the principles of need and possibility. At present, the focus of statistical work is first and foremost on doing a good job in the statistics of the socialist state-owned economy. In the past, although the statistics of the state-owned economy had a certain foundation, it was still very unsound. In addition to the relatively complete statistics on output value and output, the statistics on labor wages were very poor, the statistics on financial costs were even worse, and the statistics on technical economics can be said to be non-existent. The statistics on capital construction were a bit worse than the statistics on industrial production, and their accuracy has not been fully guaranteed. The statistics of state-owned transportation and state-owned commerce are also very weak. Except for the better statistics on procurement, sales, and inventory, other statistics in state-owned commerce have not yet been seriously established. The statistics of state-owned farms are also very poorly done. These state-owned economies are directly planned and managed by the state, and the requirements for statistics are strict. It is necessary to gradually establish a scientific statistical reporting system with the continuous improvement of enterprise management, and truly achieve timely, accurate, and comprehensive statistics. Secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in the statistics of semi-socialist cooperatives (agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives) and joint state-private enterprises. With the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce by the state, this part of the economy will continue to increase in the future. A statistical system must be established to bring them into the orbit of the national plan. The above two aspects are the focus of statistical work, and efforts must be concentrated to do a good job. As for the survey and statistics of individual agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, in addition to some necessary and feasible ones, a certain number of relatively simple statistical reports can be arranged for key parts under strict control. Generally, typical survey methods should be adopted to obtain data. As long as the typical examples are selected appropriately, the comprehensive data extrapolated on this basis are basically practical. The idea and practice of disregarding typical surveys and uniformly arranging statistical reports for all economic components are inappropriate. Because carrying out comprehensive surveys of scattered economic units will inevitably disperse forces, making the work lose focus and may cause confusion, so it must be corrected.

    In order to improve the national statistical work on the existing basis, the following tasks must be carried out earnestly in 1954:

    First, continue to establish a unified leadership system for statistical work. Statistical agencies of governments at all levels and various business departments must, under the leadership of party and government leaders at the same level and heads of departments, be responsible for organizing the statistical work of their regions and departments, and formulate unified work plans and work systems. The statistical forms of various units must be strictly reviewed in accordance with the prescribed approval system to ensure the uniformity of calculation methods and avoid repeated rework. All kinds of important statistical figures should be uniformly controlled by the statistical agencies, which are responsible for supplying them. Every figure provided by the statistical agencies should be seriously responsible and guaranteed to be accurate. In short, a strict statistical work discipline must be established, and various contradictory statistical figures must not be reported one after another, and the chaotic phenomena existing in the past statistical work must be further overcome.

    Second, the statistical accounting methods must be continuously improved. In socialist economic components, a strict statistical accounting system must be established so that statistical work can gradually play a role in supervising and inspecting the implementation of the national plan. For agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, various flexible survey and statistical methods must also be adopted to collect data and conduct scientific organization work; in particular, their socialist transformation process must be studied so that the leading organs can formulate plans based on the party's policies and these data. Statistical accounting methods must be unified nationwide, and the calculation methods of planning and statistics must also be consistent to ensure that the statistical data of various regions, departments, and years in the country can be comprehensively and mutually compared, and that the statistical data can truly become the basis for formulating plans and inspecting the implementation of plans.

    Third, gradually carry out the analysis and research work of statistical data. In order to provide correct data, statistical agencies at all levels must carefully analyze and study the data they have mastered, so as to discover problems and further propose solutions to the leaders, and give full play to the due effect of statistical work. Statistical agencies at all levels must closely integrate their work with national construction, national plans, and various central tasks, improve the political and policy level and professional knowledge of cadres, and cultivate the ability to analyze problems and judge things.

    Fourth, vigorously strengthening the statistical work of various business departments, especially grassroots units, is the focus of organizational construction in this year's statistical work. If the statistical figures of grassroots units are not accurate, our statistical data will have no reliable basis. Therefore, various business departments should be determined to vigorously strengthen the statistical work of grassroots enterprises, allocate appropriate cadres, care about their work and life, and reduce the mobility of statistical cadres, so that their work ability can be gradually improved.

    Finally, we must strive to cultivate statistical cadres across the country and improve their political and ideological level and work ability. Statistical cadres across the country must study hard, work with peace of mind, and oppose the erroneous idea that statistical work is just addition and subtraction, thus despising statistical work and not working with peace of mind. We must build our motherland into a socialist country, so we must establish scientific planning and statistical work. Without scientific statistical work, without accurate statistical data, it is impossible to formulate practical national plans, nor can we conduct timely and comprehensive inspections, and it is impossible to ensure the correct implementation of national plans, which will cause immeasurable losses to our national construction. Statistical cadres must fully recognize the important responsibility they bear for national construction and do a good job in statistical work conscientiously. It must be recognized that statistical work is a rather complex specialized work, and must have a certain political and theoretical level and a considerable amount of professional knowledge to do this work well. Therefore, it must be specialized and must study honestly. All statistical cadres should study hard the general line of the transition period and various policies of the Party, learn from the experience of Soviet socialist construction, especially the experience of planning and statistical work, and strive to temper and improve themselves in practical work, and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the state.

### 进一步加强经济建设时期的统计工作

    进一步加强经济建设时期的统计工作
    过去一年来，全国的统计工作有很大进步。首先，全国省市以上的统计机构大体上已建立起来，各业务部门的统计机构也比过去健全，全国统一的统计报表制度和统计核算方法已初步建立起来。这就有效地克服了过去统计工作中的混乱现象，使统计工作能够有计划、有系统地进行。其次，收集和整理了恢复时期特别是一九五二年国民经济各部门的各种重要资料，提供了国家编制长期计划和年度计划所必需的统计资料，开始发挥了统计对国家计划执行情况的检查作用。再次，根据政务院“关于清理现行调查统计表格及禁止乱发调查统计表格的指示”，结合着各地的反“五多”运动，在全国范围内清理了调查统计表格，废止了一些不切实际或重复浪费的调查统计表格，修订及简化合并了一部分仍须继续执行的调查统计表格，并在这一基础上建立了严格的报表审批制度。这就大大地克服了统计工作中的分散主义，减轻了基层干部特别是乡村干部的负担，也提高了统计资料的质量。
    但是，目前我们国家的调查统计工作距离国家建设的需要还是很远的。大家都知道：我们国家的各项建设工作，是遵循着社会主义的基本经济法则，有计划地按比例发展的。但是，怎样才能制订正确的计划和适当地安排各种经济的比例呢？除了在计划中正确地反映社会主义基本经济法则的要求之外，主要方法之一，就是要建立和加强科学的统计工作。通过统计，将客观事物发展的现状，运动的过程记录下来，加以整理分析，从中发现规律性，研究社会经济发展的水平、方向和速度，以及各种比例的关系，从而提供编制计划所必需的可靠的依据。从以上要求说来，我们目前的统计资料的数量是不能满足计划工作需要的，质量是不高的；对已有的资料还缺乏科学的、系统的整理和研究，统计工作的布置和要求也不尽切合实际。因此，根据国家有计划建设的需要，努力把统计工作提高一步，仍是当前一项重要任务。
    统计既然是计划的基础，各级统计机构就必须把为计划服务作为主要的基本的任务。这就要学习苏联的先进的统计工作经验，结合中国的具体情况，根据需要与可能的原则，稳步地有重点地逐步建立起适合国家管理、编制和检查国家计划所需要的科学的统计工作。目前统计工作的重点，首先是做好社会主义性质的国营经济的统计。过去国营经济的统计，虽然有一定的基础，但还很不健全，除产值和产量的统计作得比较完全以外，劳动工资的统计还很差，财务成本的统计更差，技术经济的统计可以说是没有。基本建设的统计比工业生产的统计又差一点，其正确性还没有充分保证。国营交通运输业和国营商业的统计也很薄弱。国营商业除收购、销售、库存的统计较好以外，其他统计至今还没有认真建立起来。国营农场的统计也还做得很差。这些国营经济是由国家直接实行计划管理的，对统计的要求是严格的，必须随着企业管理水平的不断提高，逐步建立起科学的统计报表制度，真正作到及时、正确、全面的统计。其次要做好半社会主义性质的合作社（农业生产合作社和手工业生产合作社）和公私合营企业的统计。随着国家对个体农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的逐步实现，这一部分经济今后将不断增加，必须建立起统计制度，把它们纳入国家计划的轨道。以上两方面就是统计工作的重点，必须集中力量认真作好。至于对个体农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的调查统计，除某些必需而且也能作到的，可以在严格控制下对重点部分布置一定数量的比较简单的统计报表以外，一般地应采取典型调查的方法来取得资料。只要典型选得适当，在这一基础上推算出来的全面资料，基本上是切合实际的。那种轻视典型调查，不管什么经济成份，一律采取全面布置统计报表的想法和作法，是不适当的。因为对分散的经济单位进行全面调查必然分散力量，会使工作失去重点，并可能造成混乱，因此必须纠正。
    为了使全国的统计工作在现有的基础上提高一步，一九五四年必须认真进行下列几件工作：
    第一、继续建立统计工作的统一领导制度。各级政府及各业务部门的统计机关，必须在同级党政和部门首长的领导下，负责组织本地区和本部门的统计工作，制订统一的工作计划和工作制度。各单位的统计表格要严格按照规定的审批制度经过审查，以保证计算方法的统一，并避免重复返工。各种重要的统计数字应由统计机关统一掌握，负责供应。而统计机关所提供的每一个数字，都应认真负责，保证确实。总之，必须建立起严格的统计工作纪律，不能再让各种互相矛盾的统计数字纷纷上报，进一步克服过去统计工作中存在的混乱现象。
    第二、必须继续改进统计核算方法。在社会主义经济成份中，必须建立严格的统计核算制度，使统计工作能够对国家计划的执行情况逐步发挥监督和检查的作用。对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业，也必须采用各种灵活的调查统计方法，收集资料，进行科学的整理工作；特别要研究它们的社会主义改造过程，以便于领导机关根据党的政策和这些资料来制订计划。统计核算方法必须全国统一，计划和统计的计算方法也必须一致，才能保证全国各地区、各部门及历年的统计资料能够综合和互相比较，也才能使统计资料真正成为编制计划和检查计划执行情况的依据。
    第三、逐步开展对统计资料的分析研究工作。各级统计机关为了提供正确的资料，就必须对自己所掌握的资料加以认真的分析研究，要作到从中发现问题，并进一步向领导上提出解决问题的办法，充分发挥统计工作应有的效果。各级统计机关必须把自己的工作，紧紧地与国家建设、国家计划及各项中心工作结合起来，提高干部的政治、政策水平和业务知识，养成分析问题、判断事物的能力。
    第四、大力加强各业务部门特别是基层单位的统计工作，是今年统计工作中组织建设的重点。基层单位的统计数字如果不确实，我们的统计资料就没有可靠的基础。因此，各业务部门应下决心大力加强基层企业的统计工作，配备适当的干部，关心他们的工作和生活，并减少统计干部的流动性，使他们的工作能力能够逐步提高。
    最后，必须努力培养全国的统计干部，提高他们的政治、思想水平和工作能力。全国的统计干部要努力学习，安心工作，反对那种认为统计工作只是加加减减，因而轻视统计工作，不安心做统计工作的错误思想。我们要把祖国建设成为一个社会主义国家，就必须建立科学的计划工作和统计工作。如果没有科学的统计工作，没有确实的统计资料，就不可能编制切合实际的国家计划，也不能进行及时的、全面的检查，就不可能保证国家计划的正确执行，这将使我们的国家建设遭受不能估量的损失。统计干部必须充分认识自己对国家建设所担负的重大责任，兢兢业业做好统计工作。要认识统计工作是一项相当复杂的专门工作，必须有一定的政治、理论水平和相当丰富的业务知识，才能把这工作做好。因此就必须专业化，必须老老实实学习。全体统计干部都应该好好学习过渡时期的总路线和党的各种政策，学习苏联社会主义建设的经验，特别是计划、统计工作的经验，并努力在实际工作中去锻炼提高自己，好好地完成国家所交给的光荣任务。
