Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Seeing the growing calls within France for an end to the Indochina War, the United States is plotting to directly control the Bảo Đại clique and use it as a tool to promote policies obstructing a truce in Indochina.

According to a United Press Washington dispatch, U.S. Department of Defense "senior military experts" advocate, at this "present stage": "more direct communication between U.S. officials and (Bảo Đại) Vietnam." Because, as calls for a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue grow, the morale of the Bảo Đại puppet troops is "gradually declining." "More direct communication" between the U.S. and Bảo Đại can reassure the Bảo Đại clique that "if a truce is declared, the United States will do everything possible to boost their morale." To achieve this goal, the U.S. is more urgently demanding to intervene in the training of the Bảo Đại puppet troops to control them. United Press said that these U.S. Department of Defense "senior experts" feel "deeply" that dispatching a U.S. training group to Indochina "would be an effective way to improve the morale of Vietnam, which has been affected by the possibility of holding peace talks." They believe that the presence of a U.S. training group in Vietnam can "clearly demonstrate" that the U.S. "is still concerned and continuing to help anti-communist Vietnamese."

In the political sphere, the U.S. is trying to expand the influence of pro-American factions within the puppet group, pressuring France to grant the puppet regime more "independence" to increase its political capital at the Geneva Conference. Three days before France and the "delegation" headed by Bảo Đại's "Prime Minister" Bửu Lộc (formerly translated as Bao Lu) held "independence" negotiations – on March 5th, according to foreign news agencies, the U.S. instigated "nationalists" in Saigon to openly demand that Bảo Đại end his "personal rule" and establish a pseudo-National Assembly through "free elections" before the Geneva Conference. These pro-American factions also demanded the establishment of a "government fully responsible to the National Assembly" and to empower the pseudo-National Assembly with the power to "ratify any future treaties of independence." That is to say: any agreement that Bảo Đại "concludes with France should be considered invalid" without the approval of this pseudo-National Assembly.

The U.S.'s activities, taking advantage of the negotiations between France and Bảo Đại, to weaken France's control over the Bảo Đại puppet have aroused unease in France. Agence France-Presse said that the publication of the demands put forward by Vietnamese "nationalists" has "created an uneasy political atmosphere" for the "independence" negotiations between France and Bảo Đại. Therefore, the French colonial authorities are trying to suppress pro-American factions. Bảo Đại police searched the Saigon "Era" newspaper offices of the Hoa Hao sect, Cao Đài sect, and Đại Việt Nationalist Party, as well as the Cao Đài headquarters, on the 5th, in order to confiscate materials that "embarrass" the Bảo Đại regime. At the same time, France is preparing to bring Bảo Đại to Paris so that Bảo Đại can escape the pressure from pro-American factions. According to the Associated Press, if Bảo Đại is not in Vietnam, "the institutions for carrying out reforms will not be able to operate."

    美国急图控制保大阻挠结束印度支那战争
    【新华社九日讯】美国看到法国国内要求结束印度支那战争的呼声越来越高，正在阴谋直接控制保大集团，把它作为推行阻挠印度支那停战政策的工具。
    据合众社华盛顿消息，美国国防部“高级军事专家们”在“现阶段”主张：“美国官员和（保大）越南之间更直接地互通声息”。因为，随着和平解决印度支那问题的呼声日高，保大伪军的士气“逐渐在低落”。美国和保大之间“更直接地互通声息”，可以叫保大集团“放心”：“如果宣布停战，美国是会竭尽所能增强他们的士气的”。为了达到这个目的，美国更迫切地要求早日插手训练保大伪军以便加以控制。合众社说，这些美国国防部“高级专家们”“深深”感到：派遣美国训练团前往印度支那，“对于提高因为可能举行停战谈判而受到影响的越南士气，会是一种有效的办法”。他们认为，美国训练团在越南的出现，可以“清楚地证明”美国“仍然关心并且在继续出力援助反共越南人”。
    在政治方面，美国正在设法扩充亲美派在傀儡集团内部的势力，压迫法国给傀儡政权更多的“独立”，以增加在日内瓦会议上的政治资本。在法国与以保大的“总理”宝禄（前译保禄）为首的“代表团”进行“独立”谈判的前三天——三月五日，据外国通讯社消息，美国就策动西贡的“民族主义者”公开要求保大结束他的“个人政权”，并在日内瓦会议召开前通过“自由选举”成立伪国民议会。这些亲美派还要求成立一个“完全对国民议会负责的政府”和赋给伪国民议会以“批准将来的任何独立条约”的权力。这就是说：未经这个伪国民议会的批准，保大“与法国缔结的任何协定都应视为无效”。
    美国利用法国和保大谈判的机会，企图削弱法国对保大傀儡的控制的活动，已引起法国的不安。法新社说，越南“民族主义者”提出的要求的公布，已给法国与保大的“独立”谈判“造成了一个不安的政治气氛”。因此，法国殖民当局正在设法对亲美派进行压制。保大警察在五日曾抄查了西贡的和好教、高台教和大越党的“时代报”报馆以及高台教的总部，以便查禁给保大政权“为难”的材料。同时，法国正准备把保大搞到巴黎去，使保大逃脱亲美派的压力。据美联社说，如果保大不在越南，“进行改革的机构将不能活动”。
