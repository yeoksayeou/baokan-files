Celebrating the Supreme Soviet Elections with New Achievements
Entire Moscow Metro Circle Line Opens
[Moscow Dispatch, March 15th] (By our correspondent Li He) Communist construction projects are underway not only above ground in Moscow but also beneath it. This is the construction of the Moscow Metro. On March 14th, the Moscow Metro celebrated the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections with a new achievement. The final section of the Circle Line (5.1 kilometers long, including two new stations) has opened, completing the entire loop. Moscow's underground transportation will now be even more convenient. The Moscow Metro previously carried over two million passengers daily, and this number will now increase.

The Circle Line now has a total of twelve stations. Like a belt, it encircles the center of Moscow underground, connecting eighteen districts and seven major railway stations of the city. A complete circuit on this twenty-kilometer underground railway line takes only half an hour by electric train. The Circle Line intersects with the other three straight lines at six points, with transfer passages at each.

This extensive Circle Line began construction during the Soviet Patriotic War. Its first six stations, forming a semicircle from the southwest to the east of Moscow, opened on January 1, 1950. Its second set of four stations, extending towards the northeast and north of Moscow, opened on January 30, 1952. The newly opened Kievskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya stations of the Circle Line are located in the west of Moscow.

Only a socialist country that cares about the interests of the people would so actively construct underground transportation lines to benefit the masses.

Kievskaya and Krasnopresnenskaya stations of the Circle Line, like all the other stations, are magnificent underground palaces. Marble pillars and granite floors gleam softly under the illumination of large chandeliers. The artworks are particularly admirable. Being there is like being in a unique art gallery.

The waiting hall of the Kievskaya station of the Circle Line has nine pairs of marble pylons, decorated with eighteen colored panels. These panels are made of millions of small pieces of colored stone and porcelain. They are themed around the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. In these wonderful murals, one can see the unbreakable friendship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples for three hundred years, their joint struggle against foreign invaders, their joint struggle against Tsarist autocracy and capitalist exploitation, and the friendly cooperation of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. The waiting hall of the Krasnopresnenskaya station is decorated with reliefs on the pylons on both sides, which narrate the revolutionary achievements of the Russian proletariat, especially the revolutionary battles of the Krasnopresnensky workers in 1905 and 1917.

Only a highly cultured socialist country would so beautifully decorate public places.

The engineering of the Circle Line is enormous. Its tunnels cross under the Moscow River four times, with a total of 2.3 million cubic meters of earth excavated along the entire line, and 450,000 tons of large iron pipes and nearly 400,000 cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete laid. The work is mechanized.

The Moscow Metro construction workers are now embarking on new construction: they will build underground railways in the north and southwest of Moscow, connecting the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition in the northern suburbs and the Lenin Hills Moscow State University in the southwestern suburbs with the city center.

Only an industrialized socialist country has the strong power to continuously carry out such large-scale underground construction.

### 以新的成就庆祝最高苏维埃选举  莫斯科地下铁道大环行线全线通车

    以新的成就庆祝最高苏维埃选举
    莫斯科地下铁道大环行线全线通车
    【本报莫斯科十五日电】记者李何报道：共产主义建筑工程不仅在莫斯科地面上，而且在莫斯科地下进行着。这就是莫斯科地下铁道的建筑。三月十四日，莫斯科地下铁道以新的成就庆祝了苏联最高苏维埃的选举。大环行线的最后一段（五点一公里长，包括两个新站）通车了，整个大环行线合圈了，莫斯科地下交通今后更加方便了。莫斯科地下铁道以前每天运载二百万以上的乘客，今后还要增多。
    大环行线现在一共有十二个站。它像一条腰带，在地下围绕着莫斯科中心，把莫斯科市十八个区和七个大火车站连贯起来。在这二十公里长的地下铁道线上，乘电车打一转，不过半点钟。大环行线与其他三条直线六处交叉的地点，都有转车的过道。
    这条四通八达的大环行线，在苏联卫国战争时期才开始建筑。它的第一批六个站，从莫斯科的西南面到东面构成半弧形，是一九五○年一月一日通车的。它的第二批四个站，向莫斯科的东北面和北面延续，是一九五二年一月三十日通车的。新通车的大环行线的基辅站和红色普列斯尼雅站在莫斯科的西面。
    只有关心人民的利益的社会主义国家，才会这样积极地建筑地下交通线，为大众谋方便。
    大环行线的基辅站和红色普列斯尼雅站和其他各站一样，是辉煌的地下宫殿。那里的大理石壁柱和花岗石地面，在大挂灯的照耀下发出柔和的光彩。特别令人赞叹的是它们的美术品。到了那里，犹如置身在别有风味的画廊里。
    大环行线的基辅站的候车大厅有九对大理石精壁，上面装饰着十八幅彩画。这些壁画是用百万小块彩石和彩瓷镶成的。它们以纪念乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年为主题。人们在这些精彩的壁画上可以看到，俄罗斯与乌克兰两个民族三百年来的牢不可破的友谊，他们共同反对外国侵略者，共同反对沙皇专制和资本主义剥削制度的斗争，苏联各民族的友好合作。红色普列斯尼雅站的候车大厅两旁壁柱上装饰着浮雕，那些浮雕叙述俄国无产阶级的革命史绩，特别是红色普列斯尼雅工人在一九○五年和一九一七年的革命战斗。
    只有高度文化的社会主义国家，才会这样美丽地装饰公共场所。
    大环行线的工程是巨大的。它的隧道四次经过莫斯科河河底，全线掘出了二百三十万立方公尺土，铺下了四十五万吨大铁管和近四十万立方公尺混凝土与钢筋混凝土。工作是机械化的。
    莫斯科地下铁道建筑工人现在着手进行新的建筑：将在莫斯科北面和西南面各建筑一条地下铁道，把北郊的全苏农业展览会，把西南郊的列宁山莫斯科大学与市区联接起来。
    只有工业化了的社会主义国家，才有雄厚的力量这样不断地进行着大规模的地下建筑。
