Heilongjiang Province's supply and marketing cooperative system has organized livestock exchanges within the province to ensure farmers' needs for draught animals and livestock.

After vigorously publicizing the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, farmers' enthusiasm for production has generally increased. Many farmers want to buy horses to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, and farmers who already have horses also want to exchange them for better horses to expand production. According to the farmers' legitimate demands and the specific situation of horse production in Heilongjiang Province, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the province have promoted internal exchanges. Up to now, most counties have held livestock exchange meetings, and some counties have held several meetings by region. From December of last year to January of this year, according to preliminary statistics from eight counties including Longjiang and Nehe, internal exchanges within each county have resolved the issue of 1,141 horses and 222 cattle. In addition to the internal exchanges organized by each county and district, more extensive exchanges have also been carried out between counties throughout the province. According to statistics from December of last year alone, fifteen counties including Taonan, Baicheng, and Kaitong purchased 1,825 horses from counties with more horses, and twelve counties including Kaitong and Taonan purchased 15,787 dairy cows from counties with more cattle, and have sold them to farmers one after another.

At present, except for a few counties that are still organizing internal exchanges, the problem of draught animals and livestock regulation has been basically resolved, ensuring the needs of farmers for draught animals to expand production this spring, and basically meeting the needs of pastoral areas for livestock.

    黑龙江省组织牲畜交流保证了农民的需要
    黑龙江省供销合作社系统组织省内牲畜交流，保证了农民对耕畜和牧畜的需要。
    经过大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务以后，农民生产积极性普遍高涨，许多农民要买马参加农业生产合作社，有马的农民也要换更好些的马扩大生产。全省各级供销合作社根据农民这一正当要求，针对黑龙江省产马的具体情况，提倡内部交流。到现在为止，各县大部分都开过了牲畜交流会，有的县并分区开过数次。从去年十二月到今年一月，据龙江、讷河等八个县初步统计，各县内部交流解决马一千一百四十一匹，牛二百二十二头。除各县、区内部组织交流外，全省各县之间也开展了比较广泛的交流，仅据去年十二月统计，洮南、白城、开通等十五个县从多马的县买进一千八百二十五匹，开通、洮南等十二个县由多牛的县买进乳牛一万五千七百八十七头，并已先后卖给农民。
    现在，除少数县还正在组织内部交流外，耕畜、牧畜调剂问题已经基本解决，保证了今春农民扩大生产的耕畜需要，基本上满足了草原地区对牧畜的需求。
