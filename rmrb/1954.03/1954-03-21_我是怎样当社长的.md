How I Became a Cooperative Chairman
1952 "Patriotic丰产 Golden Star Medal" Winner
Guo Yu'en, Chairman of the Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative, PingShun County, Shanxi Province.

In the spring of 1951, our mutual aid team transitioned into an agricultural production cooperative, and everyone elected me as chairman. Now, I will talk about how I became the chairman.

Over the past three years, I have deeply realized that to be a good chairman, one must lead by example and consult with everyone. Only then can things be done well. In the spring of 1951, when our cooperative was discussing land shares, many members were unwilling to contribute good land or nearby land. Guo Zongkui and Guo Xinhao (both Party members) and I were the first to contribute good land and nearby land, which motivated other members to contribute their good land and nearby land as well. After the land was pooled, the problem the cooperative faced was how to distribute the fruits of labor after the autumn harvest. Those with more land and those with more labor were afraid of being at a disadvantage. Some people with poor land insisted that land, regardless of its quality, should be counted equally. I seized on this issue and discussed it with everyone. Everyone agreed that in order to distribute income fairly and reasonably, labor should be the primary basis for dividends, and dividends should also be distributed according to the normal yield of each piece of land, depending on its quality. In this way, the distribution issue was resolved. Later, as the members' awareness continued to improve, in 1952 we absorbed the experience of other agricultural production cooperatives and fixed the land rent, so that more labor would result in more dividends, which further boosted everyone's enthusiasm for production.

It is right for a chairman to put in more effort, but one cannot take on everything single-handedly. At first, I did not clearly recognize this and was often so busy that I didn't know what to do first. In the first few days after our cooperative was established, it happened to be the busy spring season, and every task was urgent. Every day after breakfast, members would come to me to ask for work. By the time the work was assigned, it was late, and a lot of work was wasted. Later, I convened a meeting of the members, and everyone raised many opinions. According to everyone's opinions, the cooperative was divided into production teams, and plans were made for all the work that needed to be done, and then things started to fall into place. In the spring of 1952, our cooperative expanded. At this time, we drew up a plan for when to hold members' meetings and when to hold meetings of the cooperative affairs committee. Before spring plowing, we also drew up a production plan for the year, which was discussed and approved by the members and then distributed to each team for execution. I checked the production situation of each team at any time and reported to the cooperative affairs committee every ten days. We also discussed the production tasks for the next ten days at the cooperative affairs committee. By doing so, the members knew what work to do at what time, and I was not as busy as I used to be.

As a chairman, one must discover and solve problems at any time. At first, some members of our cooperative were not very aware, and they did not go to the fields after breakfast, and they were slow in their work. The cooperative looked lively, but not much work was being done. Seeing this, I convened a meeting of the members and asked everyone to think of a way. Everyone proposed that to make everyone willing to work, the "dead division and live evaluation" should be changed to a "contract system" with fixed work, fixed time, and fixed quality. If the cooperative's standards were not met, fewer work points would be recorded. Since the implementation of the "contract system", each team has also established an inspection system, and no one has been slow in their work. Later, we implemented the "contract output system," which guaranteed the completion of the production plan. Before the contract output system, although the work in the millet fields was done well, because there was no contract for catching stem borers, no one went to catch them when the time came, and production was reduced. After the implementation of the "contract output system," each team contracted what crops to plant, what fertilizer to apply, how many times to weed, and how much grain to harvest in the autumn. If a team planted well and harvested a lot of grain, they would be rewarded. If a team planted poorly and harvested less grain, they would be asked to compensate according to the cooperative's regulations. In the past, members went to the fields to endure the sun; now, they work quickly and well.

Regularly conducting collectivist education for all members is also an important task of the chairman. Some farmers often only care about themselves and do not care about everyone after joining the cooperative. For example, when the cooperative was first established, the livestock was not pooled, and the cooperative hired members' livestock to cultivate the land. In order to earn wages, those with large livestock would partner with other owners of large livestock to plow large plots of land and nearby land. However, small livestock were idle, and no one wanted to plow distant land and small plots of land. When the work was relaxed, everyone asked to draw people from their own team to engage in sideline occupations. When the work was tight, no team was willing to draw people to engage in sideline occupations. After we studied this situation, we reasonably evaluated wages according to the size of the livestock and the distance of the land. On the other hand, we conducted collectivist education for the members, explaining that they should take care of the entire cooperative and not just try to take advantage of others for their own benefit. On March 18th last year, our entire cooperative criticized the members with selfish ideas. Since then, the members have made great progress, and everyone has been helping and criticizing each other. For example, last spring, the farmers on the platform of the Chuandi natural village had no water to drink, so the members opened the wells to give them water to drink, so that they no longer had to run five miles to Xigou village to carry water. Therefore, the spring plowing production plan was completed on time. Member Li Tianzhu repaired the dam crookedly, and the production team criticized him. The next day, he took the initiative to repair it again.

The chairman should always think of the members and have long-term plans. There are many people and little land in our Chuandi village. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, I led everyone to plan to draw the remaining labor to engage in sideline occupations. In 1951 alone, we earned more than 6,000 kilograms of millet. In the spring of 1952, I responded to the call of the Party and the government to build the mountainous areas for a long time, and led everyone to use more than 3,000 surplus labor days to build a canal, turning more than 130 acres of dry land into semi-irrigated land. For long-term construction, I also led all the members of the cooperative to draw up a five-year basic construction plan in the winter. According to this plan, in five years we will build 47 water-blocking dams, irrigate and silt 250 acres of land, plant 15,000 pepper trees, 100 acres of fruit trees, and plant 3,000 acres of trees. By that time, it is estimated that our total income will increase by at least twice as much as it is now.

The farmers of our Chuandi village, listening to the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have taken the road of organization, and production has increased year by year, and life has improved day by day. In 1951, our cooperative averaged 423 kilograms of grain per mu, which was 114 kilograms more than the best mutual aid team. 1953 was a year of severe natural disasters, but because we fought against natural disasters, the average yield per mu of the cooperative's more than 470 mu of land still increased by 10 kilograms compared with 1952, which was 57 kilograms more per mu than the Guo Zhiren mutual aid team. Our more than 100 mu of corn averaged 596 kilograms per mu. Six mu also created a new record for large-scale high-yield production in mountainous areas, averaging 966 kilograms and 13 taels per mu.

After studying the general line, the farmers of Chuandi village sold their surplus grain to the state one after another. Our cooperative sold more than 23,000 kilograms to the state. Because we all know that only when industrialization is realized can farmers live a happier life. Now our cooperative has expanded to 150 households. I believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, coupled with the efforts of all the members, we will definitely be able to complete the 1954 plan to increase grain production by 50 kilograms per mu to support the country's industrial construction.

    我是怎样当社长的
    一九五二年度“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者
    山西省平顺县郭玉恩农业生产合作社社长  郭玉恩
    一九五一年春天，我们的互助组转为农业生产合作社，大家选我做社长。现在我来讲讲我是怎样当社长的。
    三年来，我深深体会到：当社长要以身作则，多和大家商量，事情才能办好。一九五一年春天，我们社讨论土地入股时，不少社员不肯拿出好地、近地来。我就和郭宗奎、郭新好（都是党员）首先拿出好地、近地，带动了其他社员也都把好地、近地入了社。土地入社后，社里遇到的问题就是秋后怎样分配劳动果实。地多的和劳力多的人，都怕自己吃亏。有些地不好的人主张地不管好坏，有一亩顶一亩。我就抓住这一问题和大家商量。大家认为：要想把收入分配得公平合理，就必须以劳力分红为主，同时根据土地的好坏，按每块土地的常年产量分红。这样，分红问题就解决了。后来，随着社员的觉悟不断提高，在一九五二年我们吸取了别的农业生产合作社的经验，把土地分红定为死租，多出了劳力就可多分红，大家生产劲头就更大了。
    当社长多费心是对的，可是也不能包办一切。开头我就没有明确认识这一点，经常忙得手脚不着地。像我们合作社刚成立那几天，正赶上春忙的时候，那一样活也挺急。每天吃过早饭，社员们就来找我要活干。把活分配完，天也不早了，不少的工就这样浪费掉。后来我就召开了一次社员大会，会上，大家提出了不少意见。按照大家的意见，社里划分了生产小组，把该做的活都作了计划，才有了个头绪。一九五二年春天，我们社扩大了。这时，我们就订出什么时候开社员大会，什么时候开社务委员会的计划。春耕前，又订出一年的生产计划，经过社员讨论通过以后，分配到各小组去执行。我随时检查各组的生产情况，每十天向社务委员会报告一次。我们并且在社务委员会上讨论后十天的生产任务。这样做，什么时候干什么活，社员心里就亮堂了，我也不像以前那样忙得手脚不着地了。
    当社长要随时发现问题，解决问题。起初，我们社有些社员觉悟不高，吃了早饭不下地，干起活来“磨洋工”。社里看起来挺热闹，可是没多少干活的。我看到这种情况，就召开了社员大会，叫大家想办法。大家提出要使人人愿意干活，就得把“死分活评”改成定工、定时、定质量的“包工制”，要是达不到社里的标准就少记工。自从实行了“包工制”，各组又建立了检查制，就没有人再“磨洋工”了。后来我们实行了“包工包产制”，保证了增产计划的完成。在没有包产以前，谷子地里的活，虽然都做得好，但因为没有包下捉钻心虫的工，到时候没人去捉，就减产了。实行了“包工包产制”后，全社土地种什么庄稼，上什么粪，锄几遍草，秋收该打多少粮食，都由各组包下来。那个组种得好多打了粮食，就奖励，那个组种得不好少打了粮食，就叫他们按社里的规定赔偿。从前社员下地是熬日头，现在是做得又快又好。
    经常对全体社员进行集体主义教育，也是社长的一个重要任务。有些农民入社以后往往光顾自己，不顾大家。比如刚成立社的时候，牲口没入社，社里雇社员的牲口耕地。有牲口户为了挣工资，大牲口户就找大牲口户合犋，抢着耕大块地和近地。可是小牲口却闲着，远地和小块地没有人愿意去耕。活松了一些的时候，大家都要求抽自己组里的人去搞副业。活紧了，那个组也不愿意抽人搞副业。我们研究了这一情况以后，就一方面按照牲口的大小、土地的远近，合理地评定了工资，一方面又对社员进行了集体主义的教育，向社员说明要照顾全社，不要光为了自己占别人的便宜。去年三月十八日，我们全社又对有自私自利思想的社员进行了一次批评。以后，社员们就有了很大的进步，大家都互相帮助和互相批评。如去年春天，川底自然村圪台上的农民没有水吃，社员们就放开水井，给他们水吃，使他们不再跑五里路到西沟村担水，因此，按时完成了春耕生产计划。社员李天柱把堰修歪了，生产小组就批评他，第二天他又主动重修了一 遍。
    社长要处处为社员着想，有长远的打算。我们川底村人多地少，在成立了农业生产合作社以后，我就领导大家有计划地抽出剩余劳动力去搞副业。一九五一年一年就赚了六千多斤小米。一九五二年春天，我响应党和政府长期建设山区的号召，领导大家把剩余的三千多个劳动日用来修了一条渠，把一百三十多亩旱地变成了半水地。为了长期建设，冬天我还领导全社社员订出了五年基本建设计划。根据这个计划，我们在五年里要打四十七条拦水坝，浇地、淤滩地二百五十亩，栽一万五千棵花椒树，一百亩果木树，植树造林三千亩，盖七十间新房。到那时候，估计我们全社每年的收入，最少也要比现在增加一倍。
    我们川底村的农民，听了共产党和毛主席的话，走了组织起来的道路，生产年年增加，生活也
  一天天提高了。一九五一年，我们全社每亩地平均打粮四百二十三斤，比顶好的互助组多打一百十四斤粮食；一九五三年是自然灾害挺重的一年，但由于我们向自然灾害进行了斗争，全社四百七十多亩地，每亩地平均产量还比一九五二年增加了十斤，比郭芝仁互助组每亩多打五十七斤。我们种的一百多亩玉米，每亩平均收到了五百九十六斤；有六亩还创造了山区大块丰产的新纪录，平均每亩收九百六十六斤十三两。
    川底村的农民学习了总路线后，纷纷把余粮卖给国家。我们社就卖给国家二万三千余斤。因为我们都知道：只有实现了工业化，农民才能过更幸福的生活。现在我们这个社已扩大到一百五十户了。我相信：在党和政府的领导下，再加上全体社员的努力，我们一定能完成一九五四年每亩增产五十斤粮食的计划，来支援国家的工业建设。
