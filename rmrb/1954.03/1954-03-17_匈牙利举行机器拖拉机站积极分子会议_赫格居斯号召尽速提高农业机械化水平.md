    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 16th: According to the Hungarian News Agency, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian Council of Ministers held a national meeting of machine tractor station activists on the 12th and 13th. Rakosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Working People's Party, Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, other party and government leaders, as well as many outstanding members of agricultural production cooperatives also attended the meeting.

    At the meeting, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Agriculture, András Hegedüs, delivered a report. He pointed out that, in accordance with Hungary's natural conditions, it is impossible for Hungary to significantly increase the area of cultivated land. Therefore, to increase agricultural output, the only way is to increase the yield per unit area of cultivated land. One of the ways to solve this problem is to rapidly increase the level of mechanization of agricultural work. He said that the most important task at present is to rapidly improve the technical level of workers at machine tractor stations. Various industrial departments should send outstanding technical personnel to participate in agricultural work.

    The attendees discussed Hegedüs' report.

    Rakosi spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the party and government's decision on developing agriculture is a key issue in developing the national economy in the coming years. A large part of the task of developing agriculture falls on the staff of machine tractor stations. The successful implementation of the national plan depends to a considerable extent on the good work of the machine tractor station staff. If they do their job well and win the trust of the working peasants, they will also have completed an important political task in strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Rakosi finally emphasized strengthening the party's work in machine tractor stations and called on party members to stand on the most difficult work posts and achieve victory in spring plowing.

    During the meeting, outstanding machine tractor station staff were also rewarded by the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic.

    匈牙利举行机器拖拉机站积极分子会议
    赫格居斯号召尽速提高农业机械化水平
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】据匈牙利通讯社讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和匈牙利部长会议，在十二日和十三日召开了全国机器拖拉机站积极分子会议。劳动人民党中央委员会第一书记拉科西、部长会议主席纳吉、其他党政领袖，以及许多优秀的农业生产合作社社员也参加了会议。
    会上，部长会议第一副主席兼农业部部长安·赫格居斯作了报告。他指出：按照匈牙利的自然条件，匈牙利不可能大大增加耕地面积，因此，要提高农业产量，只有提高耕地的单位面积产量。而解决这个问题的办法之一，就是尽速提高农业工作的机械化水平。他说：目前最重要的任务是迅速提高机器拖拉机站工人的技术水平。各工业部门应当派遣优秀的技术人员参加农业工作。
    到会者对赫格居斯的报告进行了讨论。
    拉科西在会上讲了话。他指出：党和政府关于发展农业的决议，是今后数年内发展国民经济的关键问题。发展农业的一大部分任务落在机器拖拉机站工作人员的身上。国家计划的胜利执行，在相当大的程度上要依靠机器拖拉机站工作人员的良好工作。如果他们的工作做得好并赢得劳动农民的信任，他们同时也就是在加强工农联盟方面完成了重要的政治任务。拉科西最后在强调了加强党在机器拖拉机站中的工作之后，号召党员站在最困难的工作岗位上并在春耕中取得胜利。
    会议期间，优秀的机器拖拉机站工作人员并得到了匈牙利人民共和国主席团的奖励。
