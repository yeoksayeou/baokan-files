    Marching Along the Road Indicated by Stalin
    Lǐ Déquán
    It has been a year since the passing of our most beloved teacher and dearest friend, Comrade Stalin. Though he has left us, his great name still shines brilliantly upon us and the entire world.

    On the morning of March 6, 1953, when the devastating news of Comrade Stalin’s passing reached us from the Kremlin, I was residing in Moscow. At that time, my heart was filled with immense sorrow and grief. I witnessed Soviet workers, collective farmers, intellectuals, men, women, old, and young, day and night, continuously streaming towards the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions to pay their respects to the remains of the greatest and dearest teacher of all mankind—Comrade Stalin—and bid him a final farewell.

    Comrade Stalin, together with Comrade Lenin, were the inspirers and leaders of the great October Socialist Revolution, the founders of the world’s first socialist state, and the creators of human happiness. Comrade Stalin inherited Lenin's immortal cause, leading the Soviet people to further achieve the victory of building socialism in the Soviet Union, a victory of world historical significance. Because of this victory, the Soviet Union defeated the aggression of imperialist bandits; because of this victory, the Soviet people's economic, material, and cultural lives are thriving. This is not only a victory for the Soviet people, but also a common victory for all progressive mankind.

    Comrade Stalin was deeply concerned about the Chinese people. He pointed out to the Chinese people a path to seek liberation, enabling the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to achieve a historic victory and begin the work of socialist industrialization.

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed with the personal participation of Comrade Stalin and Chairman Mao, is now four years old. The development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has demonstrated great strength in the cause of defending world peace and democracy. Facts have proven that China and the Soviet Union are strong bulwarks against new threats of aggression and for defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    The Soviet government and people have given the new China sincere and selfless assistance. According to the results of the Sino-Soviet negotiations in 1953, the Soviet government decided to systematically and comprehensively provide assistance from beginning to end for the 141 large-scale projects that China newly built and renovated. In order to enable us to master the newly built and renovated enterprises, they also vigorously assisted our country in training technical personnel. In the past few years, the Soviet government has sent experts in various fields who sincerely taught the Chinese people everything they knew. Under their patient education and assistance, many new types of construction talents have been cultivated in China's factories and mines. In addition, a large number of Chinese students have been accepted to study in the Soviet Union. This assistance demonstrates the great internationalist spirit of socialist countries, which is inseparable from Comrade Stalin's concern and teachings during his lifetime.

    Comrade Stalin was also very concerned about China's health care and the people's health. As early as during the Anti-Japanese War, he dispatched outstanding Soviet medical experts to China. They served the wounded and sick together with Chinese medical workers in the most difficult war environment, and trained many medical cadres for our country. In 1949, when the plague was severely prevalent in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, Comrade Stalin sent the best experts to go deep into the epidemic areas. They not only helped us quickly eliminate the plague, but also improved China's sanitary and epidemic prevention measures. In order to help China improve medical education, Comrade Bykov, a medical education expert who previously worked in the Ministry of Health, suffered a relapse of an old illness due to working day and night and died of illness after returning to his country. This great internationalist spirit is inseparable from Comrade Stalin's teachings.

    Now, under the guidance of the general line of the state during the transition period, the people of the whole country are working hard to complete the first five-year construction plan. The great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party is leading us to advance along the road indicated by Lenin and Stalin. I vow to strive to study the theories of Lenin and Stalin and work hard for the cause of socialist construction under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. I also hope that our national health workers will study Marxism-Leninism well, learn from the advanced Soviet medical experience, learn from the new medical style of Soviet medical workers, establish a correct attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly, earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism in the medical field, achieve genuine unity, earnestly transform ourselves, and strive to ensure the smooth completion of the country's various construction projects.

    沿着斯大林指示的道路前进
    李德全
    我们最敬爱的导师和最真挚的朋友斯大林同志逝世已经一周年了。他虽然离开了我们，但是他那伟大的名字仍然光辉灿烂地照耀着我们和全世界。
    当一九五三年三月六日的早晨，斯大林同志病逝的噩耗从克里姆林宫传出来的时候，我正住在莫斯科。那时，我的心情是万分沉重，悲哀填满了心胸。我看到苏联的工人、集体农民、知识分子，男、女、老、幼，不分昼夜，川流不息地前往工会大厦圆柱大厅瞻仰全人类最伟大最亲爱的导师—斯大林同志的遗容，和他作最后的告别。
    斯大林同志和列宁同志，是伟大的十月社会主义革命的鼓舞者和领导者，世界上第一个社会主义国家的缔造者，是人类幸福的创造者。斯大林同志继承了列宁的不朽事业，领导苏联人民进一步获得了在苏联建成社会主义的具有世界历史意义的胜利。由于这个胜利，苏联击败了帝国主义强盗的侵略；由于这个胜利，苏联人民的经济物质、文化生活蒸蒸日上。这不只是苏联人民的胜利，也是全世界进步人类共同的胜利。
    斯大林同志十分关心中国人民，他给中国人民指出了一条谋求解放的道路，使中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，获得了历史性的胜利，并开始了社会主义工业化的建设工作。
    在斯大林同志和毛主席的亲自参加下签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，今年已经四年了。中苏两国人民友谊的发展和巩固在保卫世界和平民主的事业上，表现出了伟大力量。事实证明，中苏两国是反对新侵略威胁，保卫远东和世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    苏联政府和人民给予新中国以真诚无私的援助。根据一九五三年中苏两国商谈的结果，苏联政府决定对我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，系统地从头到尾地全面地给予援助。为了使我们能掌握新建与改建的企业，又大力协助我国培养技术人员。在过去几年中，苏联政府曾派来各方面的专家，他们诚恳地把所知道的东西尽量教给中国人民。在他们耐心教育与帮助下，我国各厂矿企业中培养出许多新型的建设人才。另外，还接受我国大批学生到苏联学习。这些援助都表现了社会主义国家伟大的国际主义精神，这是与斯大林同志的关怀和生前的教诲分不开的。
    斯大林同志对我国的保健事业和人民的健康也是十分关心的。远在抗日战争时期，就曾派遣苏联优秀的医学专家来中国，他们在最艰苦的战争环境里与我国医务工作者一起为伤病员服务，并为我国培养了不少的医务干部。一九四九年当我国东北、察蒙鼠疫严重流行时，斯大林同志又派来了最优秀的专家，深入疫区。他们不但帮助我们很快地扑灭了鼠疫，并且改进了我国的卫生防疫措施。为帮助我国改进医学教育，前在中央卫生部工作的医学教育专家比阔夫同志，由于夜以继日地工作，旧病复发，回国后竟不治逝世。这种伟大的国际主义精神是与斯大林同志的教导分不开的。
    现在，全国人民正在国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，为完成第一个五年建设计划而努力工作着。伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党正领导我们沿着列宁、斯大林指示的道路前进。我誓愿在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，努力学习列宁、斯大林的理论，为社会主义建设事业努力奋斗。我更希望我们全国卫生工作者，要好好地学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进医学经验，学习苏联医务工作者新的医疗作风，树立全心全意为人民服务的正确态度，认真展开医务界的批评与自我批评，达到真正的团结，切实地改造自己，为保证国家各项建设顺利完成而努力。
