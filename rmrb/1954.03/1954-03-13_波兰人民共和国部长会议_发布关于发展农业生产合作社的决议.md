    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 8th: The Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland has passed a resolution on the development of agricultural production cooperatives.

    The resolution first pointed out the achievements of the cooperativization movement. Since the launch of the cooperativization movement in rural areas in 1949, more than 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been established nationwide in Poland, with approximately 200,000 members and about 1.5 million hectares of land (1 hectare equals 15 mu). The level of mechanization of agricultural operations has been improved. In 1953, 70 percent of the cooperatives' plowing, harvesting, and threshing work was completed by machine tractor stations. Agricultural production cooperatives have also made great achievements in developing collectively owned livestock farming.

    In order to further expand the cooperativization movement, the resolution stipulates a substantial increase in state loans to agricultural production cooperatives. This year, long-term loans to agricultural production cooperatives for basic construction will increase by 71 percent compared to last year. The Polish government is prepared to lend 230 million zlotys to newly established agricultural production cooperatives to help them solve their current economic difficulties. The resolution also stipulates comprehensive assistance to cooperatives in developing livestock farming. State loans for soil improvement work and electrification of agricultural production cooperatives will also be greatly increased.

    The resolution stipulates the task of the state machine tractor stations to further mechanize the agricultural operations of agricultural production cooperatives. This year, 60 new machine tractor stations will be built nationwide. In 1954, the number of tractors at machine tractor stations will increase from approximately 16,400 to approximately 19,700 (each calculated at 15 horsepower). Machine tractor stations will also receive more potato planters, grain harvesting combines, potato diggers, threshing machines, and other agricultural machinery than last year. The resolution also established some measures for cultivating specialized personnel for machine tractor stations and agricultural production cooperatives.

    波兰人民共和国部长会议
    发布关于发展农业生产合作社的决议
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社华沙八日讯：波兰人民共和国部长会议通过了关于发展农业生产合作社的决议。
    决议首先指出了合作化运动的成就。波兰自一九四九年在农村中展开合作化运动以来，全国已成立了八千多个农业生产合作社，它们共有社员约二十万人，土地约一百五十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。农业操作的机械化水平已经提高。一九五三年，合作社有百分之七十的耕耘、收割和打谷工作由机器拖拉机站完成。农业生产合作社在发展公有饲畜业方面也获得了很大的成绩。
    为了进一步扩大合作化运动，决议规定大量增加国家对农业生产合作社的贷款。今年贷给农业生产合作社作基本建设用的长期贷款，将比去年增加百分之七十一。波兰政府准备贷款二亿三千万兹罗提（波币名）给新近成立的农业生产合作社，帮助它们解决目前经济上的困难。决议还规定全面地帮助合作社发展饲畜业。对农业生产合作社的土壤改良工作和电气化的国家贷款也要大量增加。
    决议规定了国家机器拖拉机站进一步使农业生产合作社的农业操作机械化的任务。今年全国将新建六十个机器拖拉机站。一九五四年机器拖拉机站的拖拉机数目将由约一万六千四百台增加到一万九千七百台左右（每台以十五匹马力计算）。机器拖拉机站还将获得比去年更多的马铃薯栽种机、谷物收割联合机、马铃薯挖掘机、脱粒机和其他农业机器。决议并订出了培养机器拖拉机站和农业生产合作社的专门人才的一些措施。
