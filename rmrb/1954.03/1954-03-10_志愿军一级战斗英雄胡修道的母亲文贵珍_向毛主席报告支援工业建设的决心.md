Volunteer Army First-Class Combat Hero Hu Xiudao's Mother, Wen Guizhen
Reports to Chairman Mao Her Determination to Support Industrial Construction

Respected Chairman Mao:

I am the mother of Hu Xiudao, a Special-Class Meritorious Person and First-Class Combat Hero of the Volunteer Army. After liberation, we were given land, houses, and farming tools. Production is increasing day by day, and our lives are getting better and better. Last July, the Provincial People's Government even sent cadres to Chengdu to cure my eyes, which had been dim for decades. This is something I never dreamed of. I thank you for your wise leadership and am determined to follow the Communist Party forever.

After studying the General Line, my mind has become much clearer. I know that we farmers should actively support the country's industrialization and participate in mutual aid and cooperation, taking the happy road of socialism. Over the four years since liberation, we have learned from personal experience the help that national industrial construction provides to farmers and the benefits of being organized. For example, the cotton on my family's 3.4 mu of hillside land yielded 156 jin of seed cotton per mu last year because we used chemical fertilizer manufactured by our worker brothers, more than four times the yield of the previous year. Also, before liberation, even coarse cloth was so expensive it was a bite to afford, and we had no money to make clothes, so we wore torn rags in the dead of winter, our bodies frozen blue and red. Now that industrial production has developed, daily necessities are cheaper. We wear fine cloth clothes that we never wore in the past, and we have even sewn new cotton-padded jackets. Last year, when I returned from Chengdu, I took the train, which was fast and comfortable, and the fare was cheap. This is also the creation of our worker brothers! My second son, Hu Xiuzhi, and his two brothers have joined a mutual aid team, which has increased production and improved my family's life.

Now, I have instructed Hu Xiuzhi and his two brothers to work harder to improve the mutual aid team, increase the production of more grain and cotton, and supply the needs of national industrial construction. I also plan to turn the mutual aid team into an agricultural production cooperative in the future, gradually taking the road to common prosperity. Of the 400,000 yuan my family earned from selling grain to the state, 200,000 yuan is planned to be used to buy fertilizer and other means of production; the remaining 200,000 yuan was originally deposited in the bank, but recently we held a family meeting and decided to use it to buy public bonds, so that the state can increase construction funds.

Respected Chairman Mao, I assure you that I will not be arrogant or complacent, but will humbly unite with the masses, actively engage in labor and production, and dedicate all my strength to the victorious completion of this year's production increase plan and the early realization of socialism.

    志愿军一级战斗英雄胡修道的母亲文贵珍
    向毛主席报告支援工业建设的决心敬爱的毛主席：
    我是志愿军特等功臣、一级战斗英雄胡修道的母亲。解放后，我们分得了田地、房子、农具，生产一天一天提高，生活也一天一天好起来。去年七月，省人民政府还派干部接我到成都去，把我几十年不明亮的眼睛治好了。这真是我做梦也想不到的事。我感谢您的英明领导，决心永远跟着共产党走。
    这回经过总路线的学习，我的脑筋开通多了。我知道我们农民应该积极支援国家工业化的事业，并且参加互助合作，走社会主义的幸福道路。解放四年来，我们已经从亲身体验中认识了国家工业建设对农民的帮助和组织起来的好处。如我家的三亩四分山坡地的棉花，去年因为使用了工人老大哥制造的化学肥料，每亩都收了一百五十六斤籽棉，比前年增产四倍多。又如解放前连土棒棒布也贵得咬人，我们没钱做衣服，寒冬腊月还穿着一件破布衫，身上冻得青一块、红一块；现在工业生产发展了，日用品也便宜了，我们穿上了过去从来没有穿过的细布衣服，还缝了新棉袄。去年从成都回家时我还坐了火车，又快又舒服，车钱也便宜，这也是工人老大哥的创造呀！我二儿胡修治等三弟兄已经参加了互助组，提高了生产，改善了我家的生活。
    现在，我已经叮嘱胡修治等三弟兄加劲把互助组搞得更好，增产更多的粮食和棉花，供给国家工业建设的需要；并且准备将来把互助组转为农业生产合作社，逐步走上大家富裕的道路。我家把粮食卖给国家所得的四十万元钱，有二十万元准备买肥料和其它生产资料；节余下来的二十万元原已存入银行，最近我们开了家庭会，决定拿来买公债，让国家增加建设的资金。
    敬爱的毛主席，我向您保证：一定不骄不傲，虚心团结群众，积极劳动生产，为胜利完成今年增产计划和争取社会主义早日实现而献出我的全部力量。
