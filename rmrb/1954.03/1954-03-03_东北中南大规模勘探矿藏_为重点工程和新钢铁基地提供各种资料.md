Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. The geological exploration teams of the Northeast Non-ferrous Metals, Ferrous Metals, and Coal Mine systems will provide preliminary design and technical design data for fifteen key projects this year. These fifteen key projects all belong to the 141 projects aided by the Soviet Union to build China, including the Wangou in Tonghua, the Donglutian Coal Mine in Fushun, the Xing’antai Coal Mine in Hegang, and the Dagushan Iron Mine in Anshan. Mineral reserve data will be delivered in the first half of this year, and construction of the Chengzihe Coal Mine in Jixi will soon begin. In addition to ensuring the construction of the aforementioned key projects, the Northeast Coal Mine System will also provide mineral reserve data for more than ten inclined shafts and vertical shafts this year, and will also complete the survey of new coalfields such as Tonghua and Nanpiao.

In order to meet the needs of this year's geological exploration tasks, the geological management departments of the Northeast systems have strengthened various preparatory works since December last year. They have opened various winter training classes for geology, surveying, drilling, etc. The staff have generally studied the general line and technical theory in the training classes. The Northeast Geological Bureau, the Northeast Branch of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Non-ferrous Metals Administration, and other units have also opened advanced experience training classes, and drillers have mostly learned advanced Soviet drilling experience such as the "mud operation method." The roads, bridges, and lighting devices in each exploration area have also been repaired, and the required drilling machines, diesel engines, and other equipment have also been prepared. Now, a larger-scale geological exploration work in the entire region is about to begin. Thousands of drillers who are drilling at key construction sites such as Tonghua Wangou and Anshan Dagushan have continuously started drilling into frozen ground in the severe winter. A certain surveying team in Jinxi only rested for one day during the Spring Festival holiday to ensure the timely construction of the key project there. After completing the surveying of six square kilometers of the mining area in January, they have now started the topographic surveying of another mining area. Exploration teams in Xi'an, Jiaohe, Fuxin and other mining areas have adopted various methods to improve work efficiency, and have drawn a large number of personnel and drilling machines to support the key project of Fushun Donglutian Coal Mine. Now, the geological surveying and exploration work of Fushun Donglutian Coal Mine has begun. A large number of geological surveying and exploration personnel from the Northeast Geological Bureau, the Northeast Branch of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's Non-ferrous Metals Administration, and other units are reorganizing their teams and will be successively dispatched to the construction sites. Many geological surveying and exploration personnel at the construction sites have set up canvas houses, sorted out offices and dormitories, and are preparing for full-scale work.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd. According to China's first Five-Year Construction Plan, many large-scale modern enterprises will be built in the Central-South region. In order to prepare resource conditions for these enterprises, the geological exploration department has decided to explore the reserves of six minerals in twelve mining areas in Central-South this year, and carry out large-scale prospecting work in nearly 20,000 square kilometers. This year, the primary task is to provide sufficient coking coal and power coal for the new steel base in the future Daye area. The Central-South Geological Bureau has concentrated many skilled technicians and geologists to form three strong coal mine exploration teams, who will explore the definite reserves of coal in the Pingdingshan area, Yuxian area, and Doulishan area of Hunan. The results of preliminary exploration and industrial experiments in these areas last year proved that they all contain high-quality coking coal. This year, the Central-South region will also vigorously explore manganese mines, and has decided to focus on a large manganese mining area discovered last year as the focus of exploration. According to preliminary estimates, the reserves of this large manganese mining area are not only sufficient to supply the steelmaking needs of the Daye steel base, but also can supply the increasing needs of many domestic steel plants for manganese. Almost all of the lead-zinc mines planned to be explored nationwide this year are also in the Central-South region. The Central-South region not only has world-famous tungsten and antimony, but also has the richest reserves of lead and zinc in the country. On the basis of last year's exploration work, the Central-South Geological Bureau has sent three lead-zinc exploration teams to Taolin, Shuikoushan in Hunan, and Sidingchang area in Guangxi.

In order to actively prepare for the various resources needed for the national long-term plan, the Central-South region will conduct larger-scale, targeted and planned prospecting work this year in addition to key exploration. According to the records of historical materials and the clues of mass ore reporting last year, the Central-South region will conduct coal, iron, and copper prospecting work in central Henan and the Funiu Mountains this year, conduct lead-zinc, phosphorus, and tungsten surveys in southeastern Hunan and western Hunan, and investigate important chemical raw material pyrite in Guangdong and other places.

In order to adapt to this heavy geological exploration task, the geological exploration projects in the Central-South region this year have increased by nearly two times compared with last year. The workload has increased a lot, such as drilling increasing by more than 20,000 meters and trenching increasing by more than 70,000 cubic meters compared with last year. The number of various field exploration teams will increase by more than double compared with last year, and the number of people will increase by more than 1,000. A large number of geological college students and university geology graduates will also participate in the prospecting work in the Central-South region. The Central-South Geological Bureau has also decided to take learning and promoting advanced Soviet geological exploration experience and implementing planned management as the central work to be implemented throughout the year. In order to improve the technical level of employees, various professional training courses will be held in stages.

    东北中南大规模勘探矿藏
    为重点工程和新钢铁基地提供各种资料
   【新华社沈阳二日电】东北有色金属、黑色金属和煤矿三个系统的地质勘探队，今年将为十五处重点工程提供出初步设计和技术设计的资料。这十五处重点工程都属于苏联全面帮助我国建设的一百四十一项工程之内，其中通化的湾沟、抚顺的东露天煤矿、鹤岗的兴安台煤矿和鞍山的大孤山铁矿等，都要在今年上半年内交出矿量资料来，鸡西的城子河煤矿并且即将开始建设。东北煤矿系统除了保证上述有关重点工程的建设以外，今年还要提供出十多处斜井和竖井的矿量资料，同时完成通化、南票等新煤田的调查。
    东北各系统的地质管理部门为了适应今年地质勘探任务的需要，从去年十二月起就加强了各项准备工作。他们开办了地质、测量、钻探等各种冬季训练班，职工们在训练班里普遍进行了总路线和技术理论的学习。东北地质局、中央重工业部有色金属管理局东北分局等单位并开办了先进经验训练班，钻探人员们大都学习了“泥浆作业法”等苏联先进的钻探经验。各勘探区的道路、桥梁和照明装置也都进行了修建，所需要的钻探机、柴油机等设备也已作了准备。现在，全区更大规模的地质勘探工作即将展开。在通化湾沟、鞍山大孤山等重点工地上进行钻探的数千个钻探人员，在严寒的冬天就已连续地向冻地开钻。锦西某测量队为了保证该处重点工程按期建设，春节假期只休息了一天。他们在一月份完成了六平方公里的矿区测量后，现在又开始了另一矿区的地形测量。西安、蛟河、阜新等矿区的勘探队采用各种办法提高工作效率后，抽出大批人员和钻探机支援抚顺东露天煤矿的重点工程。现在，抚顺东露天煤矿的地质测量和勘探工作已经开始。东北地质局、中央重工业部有色金属管理局东北分局等单位的大批地质测量人员和勘探人员正在整顿队伍，即将陆续开往工地。不少工地上的地质测量、勘探人员已支撑起帆布房子，整理办公室和宿舍，准备全面开工。
   【新华社武汉二日电】根据我国第一个五年建设计划，中南地区将要兴建许多规模巨大的现代化企业。为了给这些企业准备资源条件，今年地质勘探部门已决定在中南的十二个矿区内探明六种矿产的储量，并在近两万平方公里的地区内展开大规模的普查找矿工作。今年，首要的任务是为未来大冶地区的新的钢铁基地提供足够的炼焦煤和动力用煤。中南地质局已为此集中许多熟练的技术工人和地质人员，组成了三个强有力的煤矿勘探队，他们将在河南的平顶山地区、禹县地区和湖南的斗笠山地区探明煤的确实储量。这些地区经去年初步勘探和工业试验的结果，证明都蕴藏着质量良好的炼焦煤。今年，中南区还将大力勘探锰矿，并决定以去年发现的一个大锰矿区作为勘探重点。据初步估计，这个大锰矿区的储量，不但足够供给大冶钢铁基地的炼钢需要，而且还可以供应国内许多钢铁厂对于锰的日益增长的需要。今年全国计划勘探的铅锌矿，也几乎全部在中南区。中南区不仅有世界闻名的钨和锑，而且铅锌的储量也是全国最丰富的。在去年勘探工作的基础上，中南地质局已向湖南的桃林、水口山和广西的泗顶厂地区派出三个铅锌勘探队。
    为了积极准备国家远景计划所需要的各种资源，中南区今年在重点勘探以外，还将进行更大规模的有目标有计划的普查找矿工作。根据历史材料的记载和去年群众报矿的线索，今年中南区将在河南中部和伏牛山区进行煤、铁、铜的普查工作，在湖南东南部和湘西地区进行铅锌、磷、钨的调查，并在广东等地调查重要的化工原料黄铁矿。
    为适应这一繁重的地质勘探任务，中南区今年地质勘探项目比去年增加了近两倍。工作量增加很多，如钻探比去年增加两万多公尺，槽探增加七万多立方公尺。各种野外勘探队队数将比去年增加一倍多，人数增加一千多人。大批地质学院学生和大学地质系毕业生也将参加中南区的普查找矿工作。中南地质局并决定今年以学习和推广苏联先进的地质勘探经验，实行计划管理，作为贯彻全年的中心工作。为了提高职工技术水平，并准备分期举办各种专业训练班。
