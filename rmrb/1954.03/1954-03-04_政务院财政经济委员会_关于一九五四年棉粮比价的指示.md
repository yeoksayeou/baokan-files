Directive of the State Council's Financial and Economic Committee on the Cotton-Grain Price Ratio for 1954

    In the past four years, thanks to the people's government's adoption of a policy to reward increased cotton production and a series of policies to support increased cotton production, the needs of China's textile industry and civilian cotton wadding have been guaranteed. 1954 is the second year that the country has entered planned construction. In order to guarantee production and the people's growing needs, the cotton field area should be appropriately increased and the yield per unit area should be increased on the premise of not affecting grain production. For this reason, the cotton-grain price ratio for 1954 is hereby stipulated as follows:

    (1) Cotton-grain price ratio for 1954:
    Area		Grain Type		Quantity of Grain Exchanged per Jin of 7/8-inch Medium-Grade Fine Lint Cotton
    Hebei, Shandong, Central Shanxi, Northern Henan	Millet		7.5 to 8.4 Jin
    Shaanxi, Henan, Southern Shanxi			Wheat		6.62 to 8 Jin
    Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan					Second-Grade Rice	7.4 to 8.4 Jin
    Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui				Medium Indica Rice	7.4 to 8.4 Jin
    Northeast		To be determined by the Northeast Financial Committee with reference to the above standards
    Southwest		To be determined by the Southwest Financial Committee with reference to the above standards

    (2) The Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government shall, before the purchase of new cotton, uniformly stipulate the cotton purchase prices in various places according to the above cotton-grain price ratio. Cooperatives should, with the assistance of state-owned trading companies, carry out pre-purchases and sign pre-purchase contracts with farmers.

    (3) Continue to implement the policy of "superior quality, superior price; inferior quality, inferior price" to encourage cotton farmers to develop the planting of good cotton varieties. In the purchasing work, the grading and inspection technology should be improved, and the price should be given fairly and reasonably according to the grade, and it is strictly forbidden to suppress the grade and price.

    (4) In fiscal levy, implement the policy of equal burden on cotton fields and grain fields, and the policy of cotton fields using cotton to offset public grain.

    Director Chen Yun
    March 3, 1954

    政务院财政经济委员会
    关于一九五四年棉粮比价的指示
    四年来，由于人民政府采取了奖励棉花增产的方针和一系列扶植棉花增产的政策，保证了我国纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要。一九五四年是国家进入有计划建设的第二年，为了保证生产和人民日益增长的需要，在不影响粮食增产的前提下，应适当增加棉田面积和提高单位面积的产量。为此，特将一九五四年的棉粮比价规定如下：
    （一）一九五四年棉粮比价：地区粮食种类每斤7／8吋中级细绒皮棉换粮数量河北、山东晋中、豫北小　米　七斤半至八斤四两陕西、河南、晋南　小　麦六斤十二两至八斤湖北、江西、湖南　二级米
　七斤四两至八斤四两江苏、浙江、安徽　中籼米　七斤四两至八斤四两东　北　由东北财委参考以上标准自行规定西　南　由西南财委参考以上标准自行规定（二）由中央人民政府商业部在新棉收购前，根据以上棉粮比价，统一规定各地棉花收购价格。合作社应在国营贸易公司协助下，进行预购，与农民订立预购合同。
    （三）继续贯彻“优级优价、低级低价”的政策，鼓励棉农发展良棉种植。在收购工作中应提高分级检验技术，公平合理按级给价，严禁压级压价。
   （四）财政征收，贯彻棉田、粮田同等负担以及棉田以棉花抵交公粮的政策。
