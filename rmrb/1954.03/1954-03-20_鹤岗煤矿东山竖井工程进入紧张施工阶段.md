The Dongshan vertical shafts, a pair of large-scale, modern projects under construction by the Hegang Mining Bureau in Northeast China, are expected to be completed this year. Once production begins, they will yield a significant amount of high-quality raw coal and coking coal, playing a crucial role in guaranteeing the development of China's steel and iron industries.

The workload for the Dongshan vertical shafts this year is four times the total workload of previous years. Currently, the project has entered its most intensive construction phase, with underground workers working day and night on tunneling and mining area layout, and the installation of mechanical equipment inside the shafts is about to begin. Above ground, construction workers are proceeding with winter construction.

In order to ensure the timely completion of the project plan and handover to production, the Hegang Shaft Construction Engineering Bureau has taken measures to strengthen specific leadership. First, linking the publicity of the general line and general task with the handover of production, concretely publicizing the significance of the handover of production and its role in economic construction, and further mobilizing all employees to understand the great significance of ensuring the completion of this task ideologically. Second, balancing mining, installation, and civil engineering, implementing project numbering to ensure that various projects are closely connected during construction and completed according to plan. Third, workers working in key underground areas have signed production contracts with the administration, and on this basis, ongoing labor competitions centered on promoting advanced experience are being carried out. Fourth, strengthening transportation, electrical and mechanical, and raw material supply work to ensure that rock loading vehicles in underground roadways circulate regularly and without obstruction, eliminate electrical and mechanical accidents, and overcome the phenomenon of untimely raw material supply.

    鹤岗煤矿东山竖井工程进入紧张施工阶段
    东北鹤岗矿务局正在建设的一对规模巨大的近代化的东山竖井，今年内即可完工。将来开工生产后，可生产大量质量优良的原煤和炼焦煤，对我国炼钢和炼铁工业的发展，将起重大保证作用。
    东山竖井，今年的工程量相等于过去工程量总和的四倍。目前，已进入最紧张施工阶段，井下工人正在日夜进行送巷道和采区布置，并将开始井内的机械设备安装工程。井上建筑工人，正在进行冬季施工。
    鹤岗建井工程局为了保证按期完成工程计划移交生产，已采取措施加强具体领导。一、把总路线总任务宣传和移交生产的工作联系起来，具体宣传移交生产的意义和它在经济建设中的作用，进一步动员全体职工从思想上认识保证完成这一任务的重大意义。二、将矿务、安装、土建工程加以平衡，实行工程排号，保证各项工程在施工中紧密衔接，按计划完成。三、凡是在井下重点工区作业的工人，都和行政签订生产合同，并在此基础上展开以推广先进经验为内容的经常性的劳动竞赛。四、加强运输、机电、原材料供应工作，保证井下各巷道装岩车正规循环、畅通无阻，消灭机电事故，克服原材料供应不及时的现象。
