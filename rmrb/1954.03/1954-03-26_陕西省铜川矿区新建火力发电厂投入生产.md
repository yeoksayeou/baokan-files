    Newly Built Thermal Power Plant in Tongchuan Mining Area, Shaanxi Province, Put into Production

    A newly built semi-automated thermal power plant in Tongchuan, Shaanxi Province, was officially put into production on March 7 this year. The Tongchuan Power Plant began construction in October 1952. During the intense construction process, the workers learned from the advanced Soviet experience in winter construction, carrying out foundation work and pouring concrete in the freezing winter. They installed boilers weighing more than 80,000 jin and turbine generators weighing dozens of tons, basically completing the project by the end of August 1953. After more than two months of trial operation, it was proven that the quality met the standards.

    Tongchuan is one of the major coal-producing areas in Northwest China, with three mines and thousands of workers. However, in the past, coal production in Tongchuan was mostly manual and could not meet the growing needs of Northwest industry. After the Tongchuan Power Plant officially supplies electricity, it will provide sufficient power for the existing coal mining industry and other industrial production in Tongchuan. In addition, the Tongchuan Power Plant can also guarantee the electricity needs for the construction of a new pair of mine shafts and the renovation of two pairs of mine shafts in Tongchuan Coal Mine this year, providing a material basis for the complete mechanization and automation of the new mine shafts from underground coal mining to surface transportation. After the Tongchuan Power Plant officially generates electricity, the Tongchuan city market will also become increasingly prosperous.

    陕西省铜川矿区新建火力发电厂投入生产
    陕西省铜川新建一座半自动化火力发电厂，于今年三月七日正式投入生产。铜川电厂是从一九五二年十月开始修建的。在紧张的施工过程中，职工们学习了苏联冬季施工的先进经验，在滴水成冰的冬天，进行打底脚工程和浇灌混凝土工程；安装了八万多斤重的锅炉和几十吨重的透平发电机，到一九五三年八月底基本完成。先后经过两个多月的试运转，证明质量合乎标准。
    铜川是西北的主要产煤区之一，有三个矿井，几千职工。但是铜川煤矿过去大多是手工生产，不能满足西北工业日益增长的需要。铜川电厂正式供电后，将使铜川现有煤矿工业及其他工业生产得到充足的动力。此外，铜川电厂还可保证今年铜川煤矿新建一对矿井和改建两对矿井的工程用电需要，给新建矿井从井下采煤到地面运输全部机械化和自动化提供了物质基础。铜川电厂正式发电后，也将使铜川市面日益繁荣起来。
