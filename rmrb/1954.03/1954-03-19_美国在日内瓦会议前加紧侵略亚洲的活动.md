Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: Commentator Jiang Nan comments on the United States' intensified activities of aggression in Asia before the Geneva Conference: As the date of the Geneva Conference draws closer, the US authorities, instead of following the wishes of people all over the world and creating favorable conditions for the conference to make progress and negotiate solutions to urgent Asian problems, are intensifying the "Cold War" in the Asian region and interfering in the "hot war" in this region.

The Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference agreement stipulates that one of the important tasks of the Geneva Conference is to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.
This issue is closely related to the vital interests of the people of Asia and the people of the world. People of all countries hope that the Geneva Conference can achieve a reasonable solution to the peaceful reunification of Korea on a democratic basis, and transform the current unstable armistice into a solid peace. However, the US ruling group obviously has other plans. Since the agreement to convene the Geneva Conference was reached, the statements of Washington officials, members of Congress, and the US propaganda machine have openly stated that the United States is not interested in serious consultations. They predict that no agreement can be reached on the Korean issue except to maintain the "stalemate" of the military armistice. Walter Robertson, US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, made no secret of saying that the United States' diplomatic approach is to keep the Korean issue on the agenda for a long time. This reflects the US government's policy toward Korea. It has no intention of seeking a solution to the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference through serious consultations, but attempts to use the protracted unresolved Korean issue as a means to continue pursuing its expansionist policy and maintain tension in the Far East.

The actual actions of the US government also show that it is not interested in the rights of the Korean people to peace, freedom, and independence, but is trying its best to support and use the Syngman Rhee group, which is hostile to the peace, freedom, and independence aspirations of the Korean people, to create obstacles on the road to peaceful reunification of Korea. On the one hand, the United States is stepping up the military expansion of the Syngman Rhee army and, in violation of the armistice agreement, is shipping large quantities of reinforcement combat materials, including disassembled and packed jet aircraft, to South Korea to equip the Rhee puppet army; on the other hand, it is politically backing up the Syngman Rhee's swindling, the Syngman Rhee group has repeatedly clamored to "resist" the Geneva Conference and reject any reasonable plan for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. The US authorities not only did not stop it, but took this opportunity to announce that it would use a one-sided agreement between the United States and Rhee to limit the Geneva Conference to a "deadline" of no more than ninety days, while also guaranteeing that Syngman Rhee could arbitrarily reject any resolution passed by the majority. The US Congress also recently approved the US-Rhee "Mutual Defense Treaty," giving Syngman Rhee the right to launch new adventures under any pretext, placing the Korean people under constant threat of renewed war. Obviously, the whole set of ideas embodied in the words and deeds of US generals and politicians is in conflict with the urgent need for peaceful consultation to resolve the Korean issue.

On the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, which will be discussed at the Geneva Conference, the United States has even more nakedly demonstrated its intention, which is completely contrary to the goals of the conference. The United States regards Indochina as the "center" of US aggression and expansion in Asia after the Korean armistice, believing that the war against the people of Indochina must not be stopped. US State Department officials and members of Congress have openly stated that the Indochina issue cannot be resolved by "political means." According to a report by "Wall Street Journal" reporter Cromley on March 8, "US policymakers are determined to continue the Indochina war at almost any cost," and the State Department and the Department of Defense are certain that the discussions at the Geneva Conference "will fail." Harold Stassen, director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, openly stated after returning from an inspection tour of Indochina that the United States has no other policy than to continue to strengthen the war in Indochina to achieve "victory."

Now, the US authorities are attempting to turn this war waged by the French colonialists into a war directly controlled by the United States, and are using all kinds of methods to tie France tightly to the war chariot for the United States to extract chestnuts from the fire. The US government is pouring large numbers of personnel, equipment, and money into the Indochina battlefield. Recently, the United States has sent hundreds of air force personnel and a large number of military aircraft to directly participate in the war, and announced that it will expand the Indochina puppet army by another sixty battalions this year. The military "aid" given by the United States to France, according to the French side, totals 1.84 billion US dollars this year. As a step to further participate in the war, General O'Daniel, a capable person under the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, has recently been appointed as the head of the "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina. O'Daniel is eager to take over the training of the Indochina army and gradually seize control of the Indochina army from France. At the same time, the United States is stepping up its intimidation and deception of France, demanding that France continue this unpopular war. The US propaganda machine says on the one hand that if the Indochina war is stopped, France's status as a great power will be "damaged," and on the other hand, regardless of the ruthless facts on the battlefield, it creates an atmosphere of so-called "military optimism." The purpose of all these actions is to make France follow the wishes of the United States and work with the United States to obstruct the restoration of peace in Indochina.

In coordination with the measures in Korea and Indochina, the United States has taken a series of coordinated actions in the entire Asian region without delay. The US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," which has been negotiated for nearly eight months, was signed in Tokyo on March 8. This is an important step in stepping up the rearmament of Japan to serve as a tool for US aggression in Asia. At the same time, in Thailand, the United States is stepping up the construction of naval and air force bases and strategic highways, attempting to turn Thailand into a bridgehead threatening China and a base for suppressing the national liberation movement in Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, the United States has established and is continuing to establish huge military bases everywhere. According to US news agencies, US military authorities are turning the Philippines into the "southern hub" and "strategic supply center" of the US military base network in the Western Pacific. The US Air Force is conducting large-scale airlifts from these bases to supply the war in Indochina. In addition, the United States also instigated Turkey and Pakistan to sign a military agreement and announced military "aid" to Pakistan. Washington dispatched a "military survey team" to Pakistan on March 15 to discuss the issue of military "aid" in concrete terms. At the same time, news has revealed that the United States will soon negotiate with Pakistan on the issue of establishing air force bases in Pakistan.

Comparing all these facts with the goal of the Geneva Conference agreed by the US authorities to consult and resolve urgent Asian issues to ease international tensions, it is not difficult for people to see the alarming distance between the words and deeds of the US rulers.

Obviously, what the United States is currently doing is not proceeding from the interests of peace, but from the interests of the United States' continued aggression and expansion. Recent disclosures of US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson's testimony in Congress show that the US policy is to continue the "Cold War" in Asia and promote a "policy of strength" in order to rule the Far East indefinitely and maintain a constant threat of military aggression against the People's Republic of China. Indications show that this policy will also be applied to the Geneva Conference. On the second day after the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference closed, Agence France-Presse Washington news said, "Secretary of State Dulles and his advisers in the State Department believe that the Western countries and their allies in the Far East must participate in the meeting with the communists in Geneva with a position of strength. The United States believes that it would be a serious mistake for the free countries to relax their defense efforts because the Berlin Four-Power Conference arranged the Geneva Conference." Facts to date have proven that the United States is acting along this line. That is, using all means to continue and promote the "hot war" in Indochina and the "cold war" in Korea and other regions in order to prevent the easing of tensions in Asia and the world.

### 美国在日内瓦会议前加紧侵略亚洲的活动

    美国在日内瓦会议前加紧侵略亚洲的活动
    【新华社十八日讯】本社评论员江南评美国在日内瓦会议前加紧在亚洲的侵略活动说：随着日内瓦会议会期的日益临近，美国当局不但没有遵从各国人民的愿望，为会议的取得进展和协商解决亚洲迫切的问题创造有利的条件，反而在加紧进行亚洲地区的“冷战”和干涉这个地区的“热战”。
    柏林外长会议协议规定日内瓦会议的重要任务之一，就是要寻求朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    这个问题关系着亚洲人民和全世界人民的切身利益。各国人民渴望日内瓦会议能够在民主的基础上使朝鲜和平统一问题获得合理的解决，使目前不稳定的停战转为巩固的和平。但是美国统治集团显然另有一套打算。自从召开日内瓦会议的协议达成以来，华盛顿官方人士、国会议员和美国宣传机关的言论公开表明美国对于认真的协商并不感到兴趣，他们预告在朝鲜问题上除了保持军事停战的“僵局”以外，不可能达成任何协议。美国负责远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊毫不隐讳地说，美国外交上的做法就是要使朝鲜问题长期留在日程上。这反映了美国政府对朝鲜的政策，它无意通过认真的协商在日内瓦会议中谋取朝鲜问题的解决，而企图利用拖延未决的朝鲜问题作为继续推行扩张政策和保持远东紧张局势的手段。
    美国政府的实际行动同样表明它所感到兴趣的并不是朝鲜人民和平、自由、独立的权利，而是要竭力扶植和利用敌视渴望和平、自由、独立的朝鲜人民的李承晚集团来在通向朝鲜和平统一的道路上设下障碍。美国一面在军事上加紧扩充李承晚军队，并违反停战协定把大批增援性作战物资包括拆卸装箱的喷气式飞机源源运入南朝鲜，用以装备李伪军；一面又在政治上替李承晚的招摇撞骗撑腰，李承晚集团已一再叫嚣要“抵制”日内瓦会议，拒绝任何和平解决朝鲜问题的合理方案，美国当局不但不予制止，反而趁此宣布要以美李之间的片面协议来限制日内瓦会议会期不得超过九十天的“限期”，同时还保证李承晚可以任意拒绝大多数通过的任何决议。美国国会还在最近批准了美李“共同防御条约”，使李承晚有权在任何借口下发动新的冒险，使朝鲜人民经常处于战争重起的威胁之下。很显然，美国将军和政治家的言行中所体现的一整套观念，是与和平协商解决朝鲜问题的迫切需要互相抵触的。
    在日内瓦会议将要讨论的恢复印度支那和平的问题上，美国更赤裸裸地表现了与会议目标截然相反的意图。美国把印度支那当作朝鲜停战以后美国在亚洲进行侵略扩张的“中心”，认为决不能停止对印度支那人民作战。美国国务院官员和国会议员已公开表示印度支那问题不能用“政治方法”加以解决。据三月八日“华尔街日报”记者克罗姆莱的报道说：“美国决策者决意几乎不惜以任何代价”把印度支那战争继续打下去，国务院和国防部并且肯定日内瓦会议的讨论“将遭到失败”。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生从印度支那视察回国以后公开表明：美国除了继续加强进行印度支那战争以取得
  “胜利”之外，别无其他政策。
    现在，美国当局正在企图把法国殖民者所进行的这个战争变成由美国直接来控制的战争，并用尽种种办法把法国紧紧缚在为美国火中取栗的战车上。美国政府正在把大批人员、装备和金钱倾注到印度支那的战场上，在最近时期中，美国已派遣数百名空军人员和大批军用飞机直接参战，宣布要在今年内再扩充六十个营的印度支那傀儡军队，美国给予法国的军事“援助”，据法国方面宣布，今年共达十八亿四千万美元之多。作为进一步参预战争的一个步骤，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福手下的得力人物奥丹尼尔最近已被任命为驻印度支那的“军事援助顾问团”团长。奥丹尼尔正在跃跃欲试地企图接手训练印度支那军队，并逐步从法国手中夺取对印度支那军队的控制权。与此同时，美国正在对法国加紧进行恫吓和诱骗，要法国把这场不得人心的战争继续打下去。美国的宣传机器一面说什么如果停止印度支那战争，法国的大国地位就要受到“损害”，一面不顾战场上无情的事实，制造所谓“军事上乐观”的空气，这一切举动的目的，就是要法国遵照美国的意旨和美国一起来阻挠印度支那和平的恢复。
    与在朝鲜和印度支那的措施互相配合，美国在整个亚洲的范围内迫不及待地采取了一系列协同行动。谈判了将近八个月的美日“共同防御援助协定”已在三月八日在东京签字，这是加紧重新武装日本来充当美国侵略亚洲的工具的重要步骤。同时，在泰国，美国正加紧修建海、空军基地和战略公路，企图把泰国变成威胁中国的桥头堡和镇压印度支那人民与整个东南亚民族解放运动的根据地。在菲律宾，美国已经在各处建立了并在继续建立着庞大的军事基地，据美国通讯社透露，美国军事当局正在把菲律宾变成美国在西太平洋军事基地网的
  “南部枢纽”和“战略供应中心”，美国空军正从这些基地进行大规模空运，以供应印度支那战争。此外，美国还主使土耳其和巴基斯坦签订军事协定，宣布给巴基斯坦以军事“援助”，华盛顿已于三月十五日派遣“军事调查团”前往巴基斯坦就给予军“援”问题进行具体商讨，同时，已有消息透露，美国不久即将和巴基斯坦谈判在巴基斯坦建立空军基地问题。
    把所有这些事实和美国当局所同意举行的日内瓦会议的协商解决亚洲迫切问题以缓和国际紧张局势的目标对照一下，人们就不难看出美国统治者言行之间的可惊的距离。
    很显然，美国目前的所作所为并不是从和平的利益出发，而是从美国的继续侵略扩张的利益出发的。最近透露的美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在国会作证时的发言表明：美国的政策就是在亚洲继续进行“冷战”和推行“实力政策”，以便无限期地统治远东，并对中华人民共和国保持经常的军事进攻的威胁。迹象显示，这种政策还将被应用到日内瓦会议上去。就在柏林外长会议闭幕的第二天，法新社华盛顿消息说，“国务卿杜勒斯和国务院里他的顾问们认为，西方国家及其远东的盟国必须以实力地位来参加与共产党在日内瓦举行的会议。美国认为，如果以为自由国家因柏林四大国会议安排了日内瓦会议就可以放松它们的防御努力的话，那对它们说来将会是一个严重的错误。”迄今为止的事实证明，美国正是按照这一条路线来行事的。这就是利用一切手段把印度支那的“热战”和朝鲜以及其他地区的“冷战”继续保持和推进下去，以阻止亚洲和全世界紧张局势的缓和。
