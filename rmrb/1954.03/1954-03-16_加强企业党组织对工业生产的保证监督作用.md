    Strengthening the Guarantee and Supervisory Role of Party Organizations in Enterprises Over Industrial Production

    To bring into full play the greatest enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and to mobilize the broad masses of workers to complete and overfulfill industrial production plans and capital construction plans with unparalleled perseverance, is the basic task of Party organizations in state-owned enterprises in implementing the Party's general line during the transition period.

    The key to Party organizations guaranteeing and supervising the implementation of state plans lies in strengthening political and ideological leadership over economic work. After the correct guidelines and lines have been determined, one of the important tasks of the Party organization is to educate and mobilize the masses to strive for the realization of the Party's guidelines and lines. At the same time, it should struggle against, criticize, and educate all erroneous ideas that distort the Party's guidelines and lines and hinder their realization. In 1953, when our country began to implement the first year of the Five-Year Plan, the political and ideological work of Party organizations in state-owned enterprises began to be strengthened and achieved results. Last year, through various central tasks, Party organizations repeatedly criticized conservative ideas in production leadership and impetuous and rash advances in capital construction; exposed the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres who were divorced from reality and the masses; criticized the tendency of economism among the masses; and began to rectify labor discipline, especially after the education on the general line began to be carried out among workers at the end of last year. The class consciousness of the broad masses of workers has greatly improved, and their labor enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. They have broken through old production quotas and created higher labor productivity. This has ensured that most industrial sectors overfulfilled the state plan and created a good start for the realization of the Five-Year Plan. However, we must not only see these achievements and ignore the fact that the broad masses of workers do not have a deep and comprehensive understanding of the general line, and ignore the fact that some workers are still contaminated with bourgeois ideology. Although these ideas have been criticized, it is impossible to completely eliminate them in the short term. If these are ignored, the Party organization will relax its political and ideological leadership, allowing these erroneous ideas to spread and grow, endangering the great cause of national socialist industrialization. At the same time, in 1954, the speed of industrial development in our country will continue to increase, and the plan for 1954 should be more advanced, and the completion of the plan should be better. Therefore, it is also required that the Party organizations in state-owned enterprises should further strengthen the political and ideological leadership over economic work, in order to educate and urge all workers and staff to further improve their management level, technical level and ideological level.

    To strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership over economic work, it is necessary to further integrate political work and economic work. In the past, political work in enterprises was able to play a great role precisely because the Party organization penetrated into all aspects of economic work, using political and ideological work to ensure the completion of economic plans. After learning from the experience of the Party organization in Factory 53, many factory and mining Party organizations first seriously unified leadership thinking when accepting each major task. In the process of unifying thinking, the Party committee led everyone to repeatedly study relevant directive documents, conduct in-depth investigations and research, thereby overcoming the one-sidedness of everyone's understanding, establishing correct ideas, criticizing erroneous ideas, and achieving consistency in leadership thinking. This is the first step in correctly and comprehensively implementing the Party's policies and guidelines and various instructions into economic work. Many Party organizations have also learned to use the method of establishing advanced figures and advanced ideas to promote economic work. When the call of the Party and the government is accepted by the masses, new advanced figures will soon appear among the masses. The Party organization promptly seizes these advanced figures, not only cooperating with the administration and trade union to summarize their advanced experience in operation technology, but also summarizing their advanced ideas, spreading and promoting them among the masses, making them banners to lead the broad masses forward and role models for the masses to learn from. In the process of realizing the plan or carrying out various major reforms, some Party organizations go deep into the production process, discover key problems, conduct detailed ideological investigations, find out the ideological roots of why key problems cannot be solved, and then carry out ideological education for the masses, assisting and urging the administrative side to quickly solve key problems. The Party organization has grasped these main links, so that the Party's political work is closely integrated with economic work, and deepens step by step with the development of economic activities.

    However, there are still many industrial and mining enterprise Party organizations that are not good at integrating political work and economic work well. The situation in which the Party organization is entangled in administrative trivialities and relaxes political and ideological work is quite common. The reason why the Party organization takes over and replaces administrative work is mainly because the Party workers lack experience and do not understand how the Party organization should lead economic work. They believe that since the Party wants to strengthen its leadership over economic work, the Party must "manage" these things. How can it lead without "managing"? Some people also believe that: "The reason why the Party has to take over and replace is because the administrative organs are not agile and the administrative cadres are procrastinating and cannot solve problems in time", so they have to "do it if you don't do it". These ideas are all wrong. The Party organization naturally has to "manage" economic work, but the Party organization does not directly handle economic affairs like economic organs, but influences and promotes economic work through political and ideological leadership. These comrades underestimated the great significance of political and ideological work, forgetting that "ideological work is the Party's primary responsibility, and neglecting this work may cause irreparable losses to the interests of the Party and the state." (Malenkov: Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress). Facts have fully proven this: in these Party organizations, Party workers only care about busy with approving notes and chasing parts all day long, but do not consider the Party's policies and guidelines; here, capitalist management ideas and technical ideas are easy to influence economic activities, hindering the exertion of enterprises' potential; the bourgeois selfish individualism is easy to erode the ranks of the working class, but the Party organization has no time to solve these problems. These comrades also do not understand the Party's method of leading the economy, and do not realize that the result of the Party organization replacing economic organs is that the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of economic management personnel is getting lower and lower, relying on the Party committee in everything, and these institutions are becoming more and more paralyzed. The Party organization cannot become an independent political organization, but has become an assistant to the administrative organs, working hard and covered with the dust of bureaucracy. At the same time, it has created a chaotic phenomenon of inconsistent production command and uncoordinated work. It should also be pointed out that in a few people, this idea also hides a certain degree of individualism, that is, Party workers and administrative cadres are arguing about "who has the final say", "who is higher than whom", "who is in charge of whom", and so on. These comrades have forgotten the purpose of the Party sending themselves to the enterprise. What they care about is not the good or bad of production, but their "size of power", "height of status", and even make the Party committee fall into the quagmire of arguing and dealing with "personal relationships". Since last year, although this phenomenon has been reduced, it should still arouse the attention of Party committees at all levels, because its harm is serious.

    Another deviation in the work of the Party organization is to be divorced from economic work, engage in Party affairs work and political movements in isolation, and they only use generalized political mobilization to call on the masses to complete the production plan. They mistakenly believe that since the Party and the administration have a division of labor, and there are Party member cadres in the administrative system, the Party does not need to ask about production anymore. There are also a few Party organizations that one-sidedly emphasize the importance of political work, and do not consider the needs of economic work in deploying work, allocating leisure time, and using manpower, and strengthen political work by weakening economic work. These ideas and practices are all wrong. If the Party wants to conduct ideological leadership over economic work, it must go deep into the production process to discover problems, raise problems and solve problems. Facts have proven that political work that is not combined with economic work cannot lead economic work. It seems that these Party organizations are busy with political work all day long, but because the political work they do is only generalized empty mobilization and calls, rather than being suitable for the characteristics of the enterprise's economic activities, raising problems from actual economic activities, and solving these problems through the Party's political and ideological work, they cannot promote the progress of economic work. Some Party organizations in enterprises are shouting to establish socialist management ideas and oppose capitalist management ideas, but they do not know what capitalist management ideas exist in their own enterprises; some Party organizations are mobilizing all workers to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign, but they turn a blind eye to the various budding advanced things among the workers and the chaotic waste phenomena in production. The Party organizations in these units do not understand that no matter when, political work itself is not our ultimate goal. The purpose of carrying out political work is to ensure better completion of economic work plans. Therefore, it is never allowed to strengthen political work by weakening economic work in any way.

    Party workers must clarify the basic tasks of the Party organization in the enterprise and the division of labor between the Party organization and the economic organs in actual work. The Party's political and ideological leadership and the Party's guarantee and supervision role should be concentrated in the fact that the resolution of any important economic issue in the enterprise is in line with the Party's policies and guidelines. The Party organization cannot be indifferent to economic work, nor can it directly handle economic work, but it must be good at inspiring and cultivating the advanced thinking of those who formulate and implement resolutions, criticizing their erroneous backward conservative thinking, and promoting them to handle economic problems in accordance with the Party's principles.

    To make political work and economic work so closely integrated, it is required that the Party committee can be quite familiar with economic business and master the laws of economic activities. Because, only by being familiar with the business, can the Party committee accurately grasp the ideological dynamics of the workers through complex economic activities in a timely manner, and at the same time, according to the laws of economic activities, arrange the order of the Party's political work. At present, most of the Party workers in factories and mines are only familiar with how to engage in general mass movements and social reforms, and are very lacking in economic knowledge. Even the comrades who transferred to civilian work earlier, although they are relatively familiar with the business, many of them cannot keep up with the needs of economic work development. At the same time, cadres will continue to be transferred from other departments to strengthen the industrial sector, that is, new cadres in the industrial sector will continue to increase. Therefore, Party workers in factories and mines must humbly and diligently learn economic knowledge from the workers, technicians, administrative management cadres, and Soviet experts. However, learning is a long-term process. At present, in the case that many Party workers are not familiar enough with economic work, is it impossible to combine political work and economic work more appropriately? No, the way lies in improving the Party's collective leadership and promoting intra-Party democracy, which is the organizational guarantee for doing a good job in the Party's political and ideological work. The guarantee and supervision work of the Party organization in the enterprise is not the work of the Party committee secretary alone, nor is it only the work of the Party committee members in the Party committee, but the work of all Party members and the broad masses of non-Party activists united by the Party. The victory of the Party's cause at any time relies on the collective wisdom and the strength of the masses, and not just on a few leading cadres. In the Party organization of the enterprise, the Party committee secretary and a few full-time Party cadres may not be familiar with economic work today, but the Party committee members generally include Party member cadres responsible for administrative work and even technical work. In the entire Party organization, there are also many advanced producers and management personnel and technicians who are proficient in business. These comrades are relatively familiar with technical and economic issues. If the Party committee secretary is good at organizing and mobilizing everyone to jointly discuss major issues from all aspects, if the Party committee is good at adopting various effective measures to mobilize and attract all Party members and even non-Party activists to jointly participate in the Party's work, the Party organization will be able to integrate political work and economic work well, and will become a fighting fortress that can fully play its guarantee and supervision role. The Party committee secretary and other professional Party workers will also gradually learn more economic business knowledge in this collective leadership process, coupled with long-term unremitting study, after a considerable period of time, Party workers will also become cadres who can skillfully master the Party's policies and are familiar with economic business. Conversely, if the Party committee secretary is only accustomed to deciding issues personally, and the Party committee limits the guarantee and supervision work only to the Party committee, not to mention that the Party workers lack experience and do not understand the business, even if they are all proficient in the business, the Party's work will still be weak and inevitably subjective and one-sided errors will occur. Because the production activities of modern large machine industry are very complicated, and any individual's understanding of the problem is often limited, and it is difficult to discern all relevant aspects of a problem. At present, the collective leadership of many of our Party organizations is unsound, and intra-Party democracy is not promoted enough. This issue should attract the attention of enterprise Party organizations and local Party committees.

    In order to combine political work and economic work, Party workers must also strive to improve their ideological level. Because, the purpose of Party workers being familiar with economic business is still to do a good job in ideological work, otherwise Party workers will become mediocre transactionalists.

    The great task of realizing socialist industrialization requires Party organizations to greatly improve the level of political and ideological leadership. In the past few years, Party organizations have initially learned how to conduct political and ideological leadership in industrial production that they are not familiar with. As long as Party organizations are good at promoting collective wisdom and experience, and are willing to work hard to study things that they are not familiar with, they will be able to successfully complete this great task.

### 加强企业党组织对工业生产的保证监督作用

    加强企业党组织对工业生产的保证监督作用
    发挥工人阶级最大的积极性和创造性，动员广大工人群众以无比的毅力完成和超额完成工业生产计划和基本建设计划，是国营企业党组织贯彻实现党在过渡时期总路线的基本任务。
    党组织保证和监督实现国家计划的关键在于加强对经济工作的政治思想领导。正确的方针路线已经确定以后，党组织的重要任务之一就是教育群众动员群众为实现党的方针路线而奋斗，同时，和歪曲党的方针路线以及阻挠实现党的方针路线的各种错误思想进行斗争、批评和教育。一九五三年，我们国家开始执行五年计划的第一个年度，国营企业中党组织的政治思想工作已经开始加强，并且获得了成绩。去年党组织通过各项中心工作，反复地批判了生产领导中的保守思想和领导基本建设中的急躁冒进情绪；揭发了领导干部中的脱离实际脱离群众的官僚主义作风；批判了群众中的经济主义倾向，开始整顿了劳动纪律，特别是去年年底开始向工人们进行总路线的教育以后，广大工人群众阶级觉悟大大提高，劳动热情空前高昂，纷纷突破旧的生产定额，创造更高的劳动生产率。从而保证了大多数工业部门超额完成国家计划，为五年计划的实现创造了良好的开端。但是，我们决不能只看到这些成绩，便忽视了广大工人群众对于总路线的认识还不够深刻不够全面，忽视有些工人还沾染了资产阶级思想，这些思想虽然已经受到批判，但是还不可能在短期内彻底肃清。如果忽视了这些，党组织便会放松了政治思想领导，使这些错误思想得以蔓延滋长，危害国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业。同时，一九五四年，我国工业发展的速度将要继续增强，一九五四年的计划应该更为先进，完成计划的情况应该更为良好。因而也就要求国营企业中的党组织更加加强对经济工作的政治思想领导，以便教育和督促全体工人和职员更加提高自己的管理水平、技术水平和思想水平。
    要加强党对经济工作的政治思想领导，就需要把政治工作和经济工作进一步结合起来。过去，企业中的政治工作所以能发挥很大的作用，正是因为党组织深入到经济工作的各个方面，用政治思想工作保证了经济计划的完成。不少厂矿的党组织在学习了五三工厂党组织的经验以后，在接受每一项重大任务时，都首先认真地去统一领导思想。在统一思想的过程中，党委会领导大家反复地学习有关的指示文件，深入进行调查研究，从而克服大家认识的片面性，树立正确思想，批判错误思想，取得领导思想的一致。这是把党的方针政策以及各项指示正确地全面地贯彻到经济工作中的首要的一步。很多党组织还学会了用树立先进人物和先进思想的办法去推动经济工作。当党和政府的号召被群众接受之后，群众中很快就会出现新的先进的人物。党组织及时抓住这些先进人物，不但协同行政、工会总结他们在操作技术方面的先进经验，而且总结他们的先进思想，在群众中传播、推广，使他们成为带领广大群众前进的旗帜，成为群众学习的榜样。在实现计划或进行各种重大改革的过程中，有些党组织深入生产过程，发现关键问题，进行细致的思想调查，找出关键问题不能解决的思想根源，而后对群众展开思想教育，协助和督促行政方面迅速解决关键问题。党组织抓住了这些主要的环节，就使党的政治工作紧密结合经济工作，并随着经济活动的展开步步深入。
    但是，也还有很多工矿企业党组织不善于把政治工作和经济工作很好地结合起来。党组织纠缠于行政琐事而放松政治思想工作的情况是相当普遍的。党组织所以包办代替行政工作，主要是因为党工作人员缺少经验，不懂得党组织应该怎样领导经济工作。他们认为：既然要加强党对经济工作的领导，就得让党来“管”这些事情，不“管”怎么能领导呢？还有些人认为：“党所以要包办代替，是因为行政机构动转不灵，行政干部拖拖拉拉不能及时解决问题”，因而只好“你不干，我干”。这些想法都是不对的。党组织自然要“管”经济工作，但是，党组织不是像经济机关一样直接动手处理经济事务，而是通过政治思想领导来影响和推动经济工作。这些同志正是低估了政治思想工作的重大意义，忘记了“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。”（马林科夫：在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）。事实已经充分证明了这一点：在这些党组织里，党工作人员整天只顾忙于批条子、追部件，而顾不上考虑党的政策方针问题；在这里，资本主义的经营管理思想和技术思想就容易影响经济活动，阻碍企业潜在能力的发挥；资产阶级的自私自利的个人主义思想就容易侵蚀工人阶级的队伍，而党组织却无暇解决这些问题。这些同志也不懂得党领导经济的方法，没有认识到党组织代替经济机关的结果是经济管理人员的积极性和责任心越来越低了，事事依赖党委，这些机构也越来越瘫痪不灵了。党组织则不能成为独立的政治组织，而变成了行政机构的助手，辛辛苦苦，蒙上了官僚主义的灰尘。同时造成了生产指挥不统一，工作不协调的混乱现象。还应该指出，在少数人中间，这种思想后面还隐藏着某种程度的个人主义情绪，这便是党工作人员和行政干部斤斤计较“谁说了算”，“谁高于谁”，“谁管谁”等等。这些同志忘掉了党派遣自己到企业中来的目的，他们关心的不是生产的好坏，而是自己的“权力大小”、“地位高低”，甚至使党委会陷于争论和处理“个人关系”的泥淖中。去年以来，这种现象虽然已经有所减少，但是还应该引起各级党委的注意，因为它的危害是严重的。
    党组织工作的另一个偏向是脱离经济工作，孤立地搞党务工作和政治运动，他们只用一般化的政治鼓动去号召群众完成生产计划。他们错误地认为：既然党和行政有了分工，而行政系统又有党员干部，党就不必再过问生产了。也有少数党组织片面地强调政治工作的重要，在部署工作、分配业余时间和使用人力等方面不考虑经济工作的需要，用削弱经济工作的办法来加强政治工作。这些想法和作法都是不对的。党要对经济工作进行思想领导，就必须深入到生产过程中去发现问题提出问题而又解决问题。事实已经证明，不结合经济工作的政治工作是不能领导经济工作的。看起来这些党组织成天忙于政治工作，但是，因为他们所做的政治工作只是一般化的空洞的动员、号召，而不是适合本企业经济活动的特点，从实际的经济活动中提出问题，通过党的政治思想工作来解决这些问题，所以，就不能推动经济工作前进。有些企业中的党组织一面在叫嚷着树立社会主义的经营管理思想反对资本主义经营管理思想，但是却不知道本企业中究竟存在着那些资本主义经营管理思想；有些党组织一面在动员全体工人开展增产节约竞赛，一面却对工人群众中的各种萌芽的先进事物以及生产中的混乱浪费现象都熟视无睹。这些单位的党组织还不明白，不管什么时候，政治工作本身都不是我们的最后目的，进行政治工作的目的在于保证更好地完成经济工作的计划，因此，就决不允许以任何削弱经济工作的办法去加强政治工作。
    党工作人员在实际工作中必须弄清楚党组织在企业中的基本任务以及党组织和经济机关的分工。党的政治思想领导、党的保证监督作用，应该集中表现在企业中任何重要经济问题的解决都是符合于党的政策方针的。党组织不能对经济工作漠不关心，也不能直接去处理经济工作，而是要善于启发和培养那些制定决议和执行决议的人的先进思想，批判他们错误的落后保守的思想，推动他们去按照党的原则来处理经济问题。
    要使政治工作和经济工作这样密切地结合起来，就要求党委能够相当熟悉经济业务，掌握经济活动的规律。因为，只有熟悉了业务，党委才能及时地透过复杂的经济活动确切地掌握工人群众的思想动态，同时根据经济活动的规律，来安排党的政治工作的秩序。而目前，厂矿中的党工作人员大多还是只熟悉怎样搞一般性的群众运动和社会改革，而十分缺少经济知识。就是转业较早的同志，虽然比较熟悉业务，但是其中很多人也还赶不上经济工作发展的需要，同时，将继续从其他部门抽调干部来增强工业部门，也就是工业部门的新干部将不断增加。因此，厂矿中的党工作人员，必须虚心地刻苦地向工人群众、向技术人员、向行政管理干部和苏联专家学习经济知识。但是，学习是一个长期的过程，目前，许多党工作人员对经济工作还不够熟悉的情况下，是否就不可能把政治工作和经济工作比较适当地结合起来呢？不是的，办法在于健全党的集体领导和发扬党内民主，这是做好党的政治思想工作的组织保证。党组织在企业中的保证监督工作，不是党委书记个人的工作，也不仅是党委会中的党委委员们的工作，而是全体党员和党所团结的广大非党积极分子大家的工作。党的事业的胜利任何时候都是依靠集体的智慧和群众的力量，而不仅仅是依靠少数的领导干部。在企业的党组织中，党委书记和少数党的专职干部今天可能是不熟悉经济工作的，但是，在党委委员中一般都还包括有负责行政工作以至技术工作的党员干部，在整个党组织中还有许多精通业务的先进生产者以及管理人员和技术人员，这些同志都是比较熟悉技术和经济问题的。党委书记如果善于组织和发动大家从各个方面来共同商讨重大问题，如果党委会善于采取各种有效措施来发动和吸引全体党员以至非党积极分子来共同参与党的工作，党组织就能够很好地把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，就会成为一个能够充分发挥保证监督作用的战斗堡垒。党委书记和其他专业党工作人员也会在这种集体领导的过程中逐渐学习到更多的经济业务知识，再加上个人长期不懈的钻研，在相当时间以后，党的工作人员也会成为既能熟练掌握党的政策又能熟悉经济业务的干部。相反地，如果党委书记只习惯于个人决定问题，党委会把保证监督工作只局限在党委会内，不要说党工作人员是缺乏经验和不懂业务的，就是他们都精通业务，党的工作也仍然会是软弱无力的，甚至必不可免地会发生主观片面的错误。因为，现代化大机器工业的生产活动是十分复杂的，任何个人对问题的理解都常常有局限性，都很难洞察一个问题的各个有关方面。而目前，我们许多党组织的集体领导是不健全的，党内民主发扬得也很不够。这一个问题应该引起企业党组织以及地方党委的注意。
    为了把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，党工作人员还必须努力提高思想水平。因为，党工作人员熟悉经济业务的目的还是为了做好思想工作，否则党工作人员就会成为庸庸碌碌的事务主义者。
    实现社会主义工业化的巨大任务要求党组织大大地提高政治思想领导的水平。几年来，党组织已经初步学会了怎样在自己所不熟悉的工业生产中进行政治思想领导，只要党组织善于发扬集体的智慧和经验，肯于努力钻研自己所不熟悉的东西，就能够胜利地完成这一伟大任务。
