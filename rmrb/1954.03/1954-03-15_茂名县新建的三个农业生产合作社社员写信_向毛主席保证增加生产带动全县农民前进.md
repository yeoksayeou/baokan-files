Members of Three Newly Established Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Maoming County Write to Chairman Mao Guaranteeing Increased Production to Lead Farmers Throughout the County Forward

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are members of the first group of newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Maoming County, Guangdong Province: Xie Village, Xinpo, and Liantang, totaling forty-seven households and two hundred and twenty-three members. Before liberation, we were exploited by landlords, working like animals, and during the spring famine, we couldn't even get sweet potato leaf soup to eat. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, we overthrew the landlords, recovered our long-lost land, and followed your instructions to organize mutual aid teams and develop production. Over the past year, we have utilized collective strength to overcome natural disasters and various difficulties, improve farming techniques, and practice intensive cultivation, achieving a bumper harvest. For example, the original Xie Village mutual aid team increased production by 29 percent last year compared to the year before. Deng Donghai, a member of the team, had a field of 1.67 mu of yellow mud soil, which yielded only 81 catties of rice in the autumn before last year. Last year, with the help of the mutual aid team, he carried 300 loads of pond mud to improve the soil, and the autumn harvest yielded 315 catties, an increase of 290 percent. Xinpo experienced the worst drought in fifty years last summer. Mutual aid team members cooperated and irrigated and transplanted seedlings, planting fifteen days earlier than individual farmers, increasing production by 15 percent. When we recall the suffering of past famine years and the landlords' forced rent, we feel the sweetness of today even more. Chairman Mao! Today's good days are all thanks to your wise leadership and following your words!

After studying the General Line and the CCP Central Committee's resolution on developing agricultural production cooperatives, our minds have been further enlightened. Everyone is enthusiastically demanding to organize agricultural production cooperatives and take the road to socialist common prosperity. Under the leadership of the county and district committees, our three mutual aid teams have been transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. Although land reform ended late in our Maoming County, we have the confidence and determination to run the agricultural production cooperatives well. We know that the main key to running agricultural production cooperatives well is to increase production. After two or three discussions, all three of our cooperatives have determined this year's production increase plans: Xie Village Cooperative aims to increase production by 50 percent this year, Xinpo Cooperative by 31 percent, and Liantang Cooperative by 35 percent, for a total increase of 51,389 catties of grain. At the same time, we will strive to reduce production costs.

In order to complete the production increase plan, we will do the following work: 1. Improve the soil. The three cooperatives will carry a total of 16,365 loads of pond mud to improve 53.7 mu of soil, accounting for 27 percent of the total cultivated area. 2. Accumulate and manufacture large quantities of local and miscellaneous fertilizers. This spring, the three cooperatives will accumulate 11,400 loads of pond mud fertilizer, 4,000 loads of green manure, and 5,850 loads of manure water; an average of 110 loads of these three types of fertilizer will be applied per mu, an increase of more than 50 percent compared to last year. 3. Practice intensive cultivation and improve farming techniques. This spring plowing requires two plows and four harrows to three plows and four harrows. Seeds will be generally selected with salt water, and small-seedling close planting will be used in the descending-style seedbeds. 4. Lead the peasant masses outside the cooperative to jointly repair farmland water conservancy to overcome drought; and do a good job in field management to overcome insect pests. Now the members are working hard to complete this plan.

We are enthusiastically helping the surrounding peasant brothers to develop mutual aid and cooperation movements, telling them our experience in running mutual aid teams. In Yangdipo Village, where the Xie Village Cooperative is located, the number of households organized has now accounted for 80 percent of the total number of households. We are also working enthusiastically with mutual aid teams and individual farmers to accumulate fertilizer, eliminate insects, and improve the soil to prepare for spring plowing, launching a patriotic production increase movement. We will use the practical examples of running agricultural production cooperatives well and increasing production to lead the 800,000 farmer brothers in the county steadily forward on the bright road of socialism.

Members of Xie Village, Xinpo, and Liantang Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    茂名县新建的三个农业生产合作社社员写信
    向毛主席保证增加生产带动全县农民前进敬爱的毛主席：
    我们广东省茂名县第一批新建的谢村、新坡和莲塘三个农业生产合作社，共有四十七户，二百二十三个社员。解放前，我们替地主做牛做马，春荒时连番薯叶汤也吃不到。解放了，我们在党领导下，斗垮了地主，收回自己久别了的田地，并且听您的话，组织起互助组，发展生产。一年来，我们发挥了集体力量，战胜天灾和各种困难，改良耕作技术，精耕细作，获得了丰收。如谢村原互助组去年比前年增产百分之二十九。组员邓东海的一丘一亩六分七厘黄泥田，前年秋天只收稻谷八十一斤；去年在互助组帮助下，担了三百担塘坭改良土壤，秋天收三百一十五斤，增产百分之二百九十。新坡在去年夏天发生了五十年来未有过的大旱灾，互助组组员分工合作，车水插秧，比单干农民兄弟早种十五天，增产一成半。我们想起过去荒年失收、地主逼租的苦，更加觉得今天日子的甜。毛主席！今天的好日子都是由于有了你的英明领导，听了你的话才得来的呀！
    学习了总路线和中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议以后，我们的脑筋又进一步开通了。大家都热烈要求组织农业生产合作社，走社会主义大家富裕的道路。在县委和区委的领导下，我们三个互助组已转为农业生产合作社。虽然我们茂名县土地改革结束迟，但是我们有信心、有决心把农业生产合作社办好。我们知道，办好农业生产合作社的主要关键是增加生产量。经过两三次研究，我们三个社都已确定了今年的增产计划：谢村社今年要增产百分之五十，新坡社增产百分之三十一，莲塘社增产百分之三十五，三个社共计增产粮食五万一千三百八十九斤，同时还要尽力降低生产成本。
    为了完成增产计划，我们要做好以下工作：一、改良土壤。三个社共担塘坭一万六千三百六十五担，改良土壤五十三亩七分，占耕地总面积百分之二十七。二、大量积制土杂肥。三个社今春要积塘坭肥料一万一千四百担，绿肥四千担，粪水五千八百五十担；这三种肥料平均每亩要施用一百十担，比去年增加百分之五十以上。三、精耕细作，提高耕作技术。今年春耕要求做到二犁四耙至三犁四耙，普遍用盐水精选种子，下合式秧田，插小株密植。四、带动社外农民群众，合修农田水利，以战胜旱灾；并做好田间管理，战胜虫灾。现在社员们正紧张地为完成这个计划而努力着。
    我们正热情帮助周围的农民兄弟开展互助合作运动，把办互助组的经验告诉他们，谢村社所在的秧地坡村，现在组织起来的农户已占总户数百分之八十。我们还和互助组和单干农民一起热烈积肥、除虫，改良土壤，准备春耕，掀起了爱国增产运动。我们要用办好农业生产合作社、增加生产量的实际事例，带动全县八十余万农民兄弟在社会主义的光明大道上稳步前进。
  谢村、新坡、莲塘三个农业生产合作社社员
