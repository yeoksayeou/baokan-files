    Shanghai Aquatic Products Company Fishing Vessel Catches Whale Weighing 80,000 Jin

    On March 3rd, a fishing vessel of the state-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company caught a huge whale in the Yellow Sea. This whale weighed approximately 80,000 jin. It was discovered already injured and dead. It is a large whale rarely seen in the coastal waters of East China and has now been towed to Shanghai.

    This whale is approximately 70 feet long, nearly two people tall, and when its mouth is opened, a person can stand upright and walk in and out. The whale's vertebrae are more than one foot in diameter. It is roughly estimated that the whale contains more than 20,000 jin of whale oil, and the entire body of whale meat can be made into approximately 15,000 jin of fishmeal. The most valuable part is the whale brain oil, which can be used as a lubricant for various precision machines and instruments. The Shanghai Aquatic Products Company is now devising a way to transport it ashore for utilization. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海水产公司渔轮捞获一条八万斤重的鲸鱼
    三月三日，国营上海水产公司的一艘渔轮在黄海海面上，捞获一条巨大鲸鱼。这条鲸鱼重约八万斤，发现时已受伤而死，是华东沿海罕见的大鲸鱼。现已拖运到上海。
    这条鲸鱼身长七十英尺左右，有近两人高，鱼嘴拉开，一个人可站直走进走出，鱼脊椎骨直径长一英尺多，据粗略估计，该鲸鱼含的鱼油有二万多斤，全身鱼肉可制成鱼粉约一万五千斤。其中最贵重的是鲸脑油，可作各种精密机器和仪器的润滑油。现上海水产公司正设法把它搬运上岸，加以利用。　　（新华社）
