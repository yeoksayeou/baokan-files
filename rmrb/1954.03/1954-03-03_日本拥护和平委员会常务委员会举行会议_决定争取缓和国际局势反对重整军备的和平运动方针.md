    Regarding the issue of Japanese rearmament, the meeting decided to launch a movement against the US Mutual Security "Assistance," against rearmament, and against amending the Peace Constitution, and to cooperate with other peace groups to launch propaganda and signature campaigns.
    In addition, the meeting also decided to continue to promote the movement to invite representatives of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to visit Japan.
