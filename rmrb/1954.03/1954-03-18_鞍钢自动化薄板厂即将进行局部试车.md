In the northeast corner of Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill stands the enormous factory building of China's first automated thin plate mill. The workers have cleaned it meticulously. The rows of skylight glass on the roof of the factory building gleam dazzlingly under the warm spring sunshine, appearing especially beautiful. Inside the spacious factory building, workers and technicians are cleaning and adjusting various machines.

Currently, the factory building, walls, metal structures, various pipelines, the installation of various machines, and the electrical installation projects including transformers, operating machines, wiring ducts, crane motor tracks, electromagnetic stations, electrical panels, and automatic switches have all been completed, either entirely or mostly.

At present, 90% of the factory's cable lines have been laid. If the remaining cable lines arrive on schedule, full trial runs of the factory's most important machinery and equipment—the roughing mill and finishing mill—can begin in late April. By late March, the roller table section will undergo trial runs, and partial trial runs of other parts of the project will continue as well.

    鞍钢自动化薄板厂即将进行局部试车
    在鞍钢大型轧钢厂的东北角，屹立着我国第一座自动化薄板厂的巨大厂房。工人们已把它修饰得非常整洁。厂房房顶的一排排的天窗玻璃在初春的暖和的阳光照耀下，发出耀眼的光芒，显得格外美丽。在宽大的厂房里面，工人和技术人员正清洗、调整各种机器。
    现在，该厂的厂房、墙壁、金属构架、各种管道、各种机器的安装和电装工程的变压器、操纵机、电线管道、吊车摩电道、电磁站、电盘、自动开关等工程都已全部或大部完工。
    目前，全厂的电缆线已穿完百分之九十，其余一部分电缆线如按期到达，四月下旬即可开始进行全厂最主要的机器设备——荒轧机、精轧机的全部试车。到三月下旬，辊道部分即将进行试车，其他部分工程也将继续进行局部试车。
