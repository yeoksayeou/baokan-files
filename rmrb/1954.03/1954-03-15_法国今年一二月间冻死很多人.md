Xinhua News Agency report: Europe has been particularly cold this winter. From the end of January to the beginning of February, the temperature dropped to ten to twenty degrees below zero Celsius, an unusually cold spell not seen in over eighty years. Under the attack of the cold, more than ten people froze to death every day in France, especially the elderly and children.

During the Second World War, 600,000 houses in France were destroyed, and the housing shortage has long been a serious social problem throughout the country. However, only 23 percent of the old houses have been rebuilt so far, and many French people have no choice but to sleep in the streets, under bridges, or at church doors.

    法国今年一二月间冻死很多人
    据新华社讯：今年冬天欧洲特别寒冷。从一月底到二月初，气温曾下降到摄氏零下十几度到二十多度，这是八十多年来没有的奇寒。在寒冷的袭击下，法国每天总有十多人冻死，其中以老年人和小孩特别多。
    法国在第二次世界大战期间有六十万间房屋遭受破坏，房荒早就成为全国一个严重的社会问题。可是，到现在为止修建起来的旧房屋只有百分之二十三，许多法国人民便不得不露宿街头、桥下或是教堂门口。
