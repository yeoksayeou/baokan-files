Comrades!

    The Third World Congress of Trade Unions is of great importance to the development of the workers' movement in various countries around the world.
    The situation since the Third World Congress has proven that the movement of the working masses against the arms race and preparations for another world war is surging.
    With the strength of the laboring people and all progressive humanity growing stronger, the most reactionary forces, while verbally claiming to safeguard peace, are actually opposing the people's struggle for easing international tensions.
    The increasingly louder movement of people of all countries demanding peaceful resolution of all disputes has forced the governments of the largest capitalist countries to accept the Soviet Union's proposal for a meeting of the four foreign ministers.
    The Berlin Conference attracted the attention of the laboring people of all countries.
    Millions of people believe that seeking concrete steps to ease international tensions is the main task and essence of the Berlin Conference.
    The Soviet Union, which has consistently strived for peace, put forward a series of proposals at the Berlin Conference, a concrete and comprehensive action program for resolving outstanding international issues.
    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union proposed holding a conference of the five major powers to discuss outstanding international issues and suggested convening a world general disarmament conference in 1954.
    Faced with a situation where the U.S. monopoly capitalists' policy of expanding armaments has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction, and the Soviet Union's peace-seeking policy, which is in line with the interests of the laboring people, has gained increasingly enthusiastic support, the Western countries had no choice but to agree to convene a meeting in Geneva with representatives from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, to resolve the Korean issue and discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    The Berlin Conference also reached the following agreement: The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should take steps to promote a successful resolution of the disarmament issue, or at least a substantial reduction in armaments.
    On the German issue, the Soviet Union also put forward a series of concrete proposals.
    However, the representatives of the Western countries rejected these proposals, just as they rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for guaranteeing collective security in Europe.
    The Western countries, determined to restore German militarism, rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on the Austrian issue.
    The Berlin Conference and the resumption of direct contact between the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are of positive significance.
    The policy of the imperialist forces is not one of easing international tensions, but one of strengthening and expanding their aggressive treaties and blocs, and establishing various military alliances and groups.
    American diplomats fear that rearmament plans and the "European Defense Community" headed by the revived German Wehrmacht will be threatened.
    This policy of preparing for and provoking a new war has aroused resistance from the laboring people of all countries and all peace-loving people.
    The task of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations is to make the working class's struggle against the arms race, against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties, and against Germany's joining the European countries' aggressive bloc, more vigorous and more powerful.
    The Third World Congress of Trade Unions clearly defined the position of the world workers' movement. In the appeal to the workers and trade unions of European countries adopted at the congress, it called on the laboring people of Europe to stop the realization of the vicious plan to revive German militarism, prevent the re-establishment of the Hitler Wehrmacht, and the formation of military blocs of European countries.
    The struggle to ease international tensions and safeguard peace should become the most pressing concern of millions of laboring people who are overwhelmed by the burden of armaments.
    The expansion of armaments by the U.S. military-industrial monopolies has placed an excessive burden on the budgets of capitalist countries, leading to increased taxes, rising prices, and a further reduction in the living standards of the vast majority of laboring people.
    We know that the deepening economic crisis in the United States has a disastrous impact on the economies of other capitalist countries.
    Indicative of the crisis are the reduction in production, the increase in unemployment, the decline in wages, and the decline in people's purchasing power.
    Due to the arms race, the continuous deterioration of the situation of the people in capitalist countries, and the increasing impoverishment of the people in colonies and dependent countries, the important task of the trade unions at present is to strengthen the working class's struggle for its own interests and pressing demands. The workers' movement is increasingly transcending the narrow scope of localized struggles for limited demands, and taking on the scale of a worldwide movement of the broad masses of people striving for democracy, freedom, national independence, and peace.
    The widespread response and support for the Third World Congress of Trade Unions shows that the laboring people regard this congress as an important contribution to strengthening the international workers' movement. The Soviet people paid great attention to the work of the congress with great interest.
    After the conclusion of the congress, meetings and trade union cadre conferences were held in major industrial enterprises, institutions, and workers' residential areas in the Soviet Union, with the participation of the congress delegates.
    In cities such as Moscow, Stalingrad, and Tashkent, tens of thousands of people participated in such conferences. Many resolutions expressed heartfelt support for the unity of the working class, which the World Federation of Trade Unions is resolutely promoting.
    The factory employees in our country unanimously support the congress resolution, and believe that the World Federation of Trade Unions will unite the vast laboring people of all countries in the world to implement its resolutions.
    The current task is for the World Federation of Trade Unions to unite the laboring people with different trade union affiliations around the plan formulated by the congress. To this end, it is first necessary to make the vast laboring people of all countries in the world aware of the resolutions of the Third World Congress of Trade Unions, especially the laboring people in countries where the workers' movement is led by reformist trade union leaders, because these trade union leaders are doing everything possible to prevent the inspiring resolutions of the congress from reaching factories, mines, coal mines, and all places where the vast laboring people are exploited by capitalism. This is even more important because the enemies of the working class are doing their utmost to distort the resolutions of the congress and slander the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" have recently stepped up their sabotage activities. The chairman of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" issued a provocative statement at the end of January, making shameless attacks and slanders against the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The leadership of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" ordered its affiliated unions not to respond to our Third Congress's "Open Letter" and not to maintain any relations with the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    We must expose this divisive act by the splitters, who slander the World Federation of Trade Unions in order to undermine trade union unity.
    Therefore, it is necessary for the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions to issue a statement exposing the divisive policies of the leadership of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions."
    I would like to draw the attention of the members of the Executive Bureau to some facts about the anti-labor sabotage activities carried out by the leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," who are pursuing the policies of the American aggressive bloc.
    Take the issue of developing trade between East and West as an example. Developing this trade can help ease international tensions and, first and foremost, raise the living standards of the laboring people.
    Even some government officials in Western European countries admit that it is necessary to expand trade in order to strengthen peaceful relations between countries.
    Only the American aggressive bloc is a fierce opponent of developing trade relations between West and East.
    And now, what is the attitude of the leadership of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"?
    It is completely in line with the policies of the American aggressive bloc.
    Moreover, as broadcast by the American radio station in late February, the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" put forward some questions to its members, one of which was the provocative question of how, in their opinion, to ban the sale of goods produced by "forced labor" – meaning the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies – in their countries.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions must very strongly expose the sabotage activities of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" leadership against the interests of the workers, and must counterattack every provocative word of theirs.
    Now, trade unions that have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions are increasingly clearly seeing that the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations are the true rulers of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," and all the activities of this organization are subject to the will of the leaders of the AFL and CIO, who defend not the interests of the laboring people, but the interests of the imperialists.
    Comrades, I would like to talk about the World Federation of Trade Unions' work plan for 1954.
    The secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions has proposed a work plan for this year that involves many issues. The implementation of this plan will enable the World Federation of Trade Unions to greatly strengthen and expand its influence. The next task is to ensure the realization of this plan. However, in order to realize this plan, it is necessary to specify some of its provisions.
    The secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions plans to organize several visits by staff members of the World Federation of Trade Unions and its trade union internationals to some countries, in order to study the situation on the ground and provide practical assistance to trade union organizations. We believe that this plan is absolutely correct.
    We believe that, under the current circumstances, when the general economic crisis is deepening and the living conditions of the laboring people in capitalist and colonial countries are deteriorating, it is increasingly necessary to strengthen the World Federation of Trade Unions' activities in the United Nations Economic and Social Council and in the International Labour Organization.
    In the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions must help to objectively analyze the economic situation of the laboring people and must expose the policies of the reactionary leaders in the workers' movement that violate the interests of the workers.
    In implementing the resolutions of the Third World Congress of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Trade Unions should consider the national and economic conditions of every capitalist country, colonial country, and semi-colonial country.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions must determine its course of action based on these characteristics and after studying them, without changing the basic principles of our organization's program and charter.
    Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions should consider the opinions and suggestions of the trade union centers of various countries in its practical work.
    The Executive Bureau must indicate its position on the proposal put forward by the World Peace Council to hold an international conference in 1954. The purpose of this conference is to promote the easing of international tensions. We are willing to support this proposal. The World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations should actively participate in this international conference. The World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliated organizations have a responsibility to do everything possible to assist the World Peace Council, so that trade union organizations that have not yet joined the World Federation of Trade Unions can also participate widely in this conference.
    In order to continue to uphold the cause of peace, the World Federation of Trade Unions must make unremitting efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the cessation of the war in Indochina, and the consolidation of world peace.
    We believe that it is necessary for the Executive Bureau to make recommendations to the secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the trade union organizations of various countries to strengthen the work of interpreting and implementing the resolutions of the Third World Congress of Trade Unions.
    It is equally necessary to draw the attention of the secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to the fact that it should strengthen the struggle of the workers against the Paris and Bonn militarist treaties.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions must urge the trade unions of European countries, especially Germany and Germany's neighboring countries, to stop the resurgence of German militarism and revanchism, because German militarism and revanchism are a serious threat to peace and international security.
    Finally, on the issue of international trade, the Executive Bureau should call on the trade union organizations and workers of various countries to strive to expand economic and trade relations between the West and the East, in order to consolidate peaceful relations between countries and improve the living standards of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries.
    The resolution of the Executive Bureau passed at this meeting will further strengthen the influence of the World Federation of Trade Unions among the broad masses of factory workers, office staff, and intellectuals.
    Persistently implementing the resolutions of the Third World Congress of Trade Unions and the Executive Bureau will achieve new victories in strengthening the unity of the international workers' movement.

### 在世界工会联合会执行局会议上  尼·米·什维尔尼克同志的发言

    在世界工会联合会执行局会议上
    尼·米·什维尔尼克同志的发言
    同志们！
    世界工会第三次代表大会对世界各国工人运动的发展是十分重要的。
    第三次代表大会以后的形势证明，劳动群众反对扩军和准备另一次世界大战的政策的运动正在高涨。
    在这种劳动人民和全体进步人类的力量日益强大的情况下，最反动的势力口头说维护和平，实际上却在反对人民争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争。
    各国人民要求和平解决所有争端的日益高涨的运动，曾经迫使最大的资本主义国家的政府接受苏联的关于召开四国外长会议的建议。
    柏林会议吸引了各国劳动人民的注意。
    千百万人民认为，寻求具体步骤来缓和国际紧张局势是柏林会议的主要任务和实质。
    一贯努力谋取和平的苏联在柏林会议上提出了一系列的建议，一个解决悬而未决的国际问题的具体的、全面的行动纲领。
    大家知道，苏联建议举行五大国会议来讨论悬而未决的国际问题，并建议在一九五四年召开一个世界普遍裁军会议。
    美国垄断资本家的扩军政策引起了日益强烈的不满，苏联的符合于劳动人民利益的谋取和平的政策得到了日益热烈的拥护，面临着这种形势，西方国家才不得不同意在日内瓦召开美国、法国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国及其他有关国家代表的会议，来解决朝鲜问题和讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    柏林会议也达成了下列协议：美国、英国、法国和苏联政府应该采取步骤来促进裁军问题或至少是大量裁减军备问题的顺利解决。
    在德国问题上，苏联也提出了一系列的具体建议。
    但是，西方国家的代表拒绝了这些建议，就像他们拒绝苏联的保障欧洲集体安全的建议一样。
    一心要恢复德国军国主义的西方国家拒绝了苏联关于奥地利问题的建议。
    柏林会议和法、英、美、苏外长直接接触的恢复是具有肯定的意义的。
    帝国主义势力的政策并不是缓和国际紧张局势的政策，而是加强与扩大他们的侵略条约和集团以及建立各种军事同盟和集团的政策。
    美国外交家们害怕重新武装计划和以复活的德国国防军为首的“欧洲防务集团”受到威胁。
    这种准备和挑拨新战争的政策引起了各国劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人民的反抗。
    世界工联及其所属组织的任务是使工人阶级反对军备竞赛、反对批准波恩和巴黎条约以及反对德国加入欧洲国家侵略集团的斗争，变得更有生气、更有力量。
    世界工会第三次代表大会明确地规定了世界工人运动的立场。在大会通过的告欧洲各国工人与工会书中号召欧洲劳动人民制止复活德国军国主义的恶毒计划的实现，阻止希特勒国防军的重新建立和欧洲国家军事集团的组成。
    争取缓和国际紧张局势与维护和平的斗争应该成为千百万被军备重担压得喘不过气来的劳动人民最关心的问题。
    美国的军火工业垄断资本所进行的扩充军备运动使得资本主义国家的预算有了过重的负担，使得赋税增加，物价上涨，并使广大劳动人民的生活水平更加降低。
    我们知道，美国的正在加深的经济危机对于其他资本主义国家的经济有灾难性的影响。
    说明危机征兆的是生产的缩减，失业人数的增加、工资的下降与人民购买力的下降。
    由于军备竞赛，资本主义国家人民情况的不断恶化、殖民地与附属国人民的日益贫困，工会当前的重要任务就是加强工人阶级争取切身利益与迫切要求的斗争。工人运动正在越来越大的程度上超越争取有限要求的局部性斗争的狭小范围，而具有了广大人民争取民主、自由、民族独立与和平的世界范围运动的规模。
    世界工会第三次代表大会所得到的广泛响应与支持说明劳动人民把这次大会看作是对加强国际工人运动的一个重要贡献。苏联人民以极大的兴趣注意大会的工作。
    大会结束以后，在苏联各大工业企业、机关与工人住宅区，在大会代表的参加下，举行了会议与工会干部大会。
    在莫斯科、斯大林格勒、塔什干等城市，成千成万的人参加了这样的大会。许多决议表示了衷心拥护世界工联正在坚决促进的工人阶级的团结。
    我国工厂职工一致拥护大会决议，并相信世界工联将团结世界各国的广大劳动人民来执行它的决议。
    当前的任务是由世界工联来把工会关系不同的劳动人民团结在大会所拟订的计划的周围。为此，首先有必要使世界各国的广大劳动人民知道世界工会第三次代表大会的决议，尤其是要让那些由改良主义者的工会领袖领导工人运动的国家的劳动人民知道，因为这些工会领袖千方百计地阻挠大会的令人鼓舞的决议传到工厂、矿山、煤矿、以及广大劳动人民受资本主义剥削的一切地方。由于工人阶级的敌人费尽心机要想歪曲大会的决议并诬蔑世界工联，这一点也就更加重要。
    “国际自由工会联合会”的领袖最近加紧了他们的破坏活动。“国际自由工会联合会”主席在一月底发表了一个挑衅性的声明，对世界工联进行了无耻的攻击与诽谤。
    “国际自由工会联合会”领导方面命令它所属的工会不要答复我们第三次代表大会的“公开信”，并且不要和世界工联维持任何关系。
    我们必须揭穿分裂者的这种挑拨行为，他们诬蔑世界工联以破坏工会的团结。
    因此，世界工联执行局有必要发表声明，揭穿“国际自由工会联合会”领导上的分裂政策。
    我请执行局的委员们注意奉行美国侵略集团的政策的“国际自由工会联合会”领袖们进行反劳工的破坏活动的某些事实。
    以发展东西方贸易问题为例。发展这种贸易能有助于缓和国际紧张局势，并且，首先能提高劳动人民的生活水平。
    甚至西欧国家的某些政府人士也承认必须扩大贸易来加强各国人民的和平关系。
    只有美国侵略集团才是发展西方和东方贸易关系的激烈反对者。
    而现在，“国际自由工会联合会”领导方面的态度又是怎样呢？
    它完全是符合于美国侵略集团的政策的。
    此外，就像美国电台在二月底所广播的，“国际自由工会联合会”向它的会员提出了一些问题，其中一个挑拨性的问题是，根据它们的意见，怎样在他们国内禁止销售“强迫劳动”——意指苏联和人民民主国家——所生产的商品。
    世界工联必须非常有力地揭穿“国际自由工会联合会”领导方面的反工人利益的破坏活动，并且要对他们的每一个挑衅的字句予以反击。
    现在，还没有参加世界工联的工会越来越清楚地看到，美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会的领袖是“国际自由工会联合会”的真正的支配者，这个组织的一切活动都服从于劳联和产联的领袖的意志，而这些人所维护的，不是劳动人民的利益，而是帝国主义者的利益。
    同志们，我想谈一谈世界工联一九五四年的工作计划。
    世界工会联合会书记处所提出的今年的工作计划涉及了许多问题。这个计划的执行将使世界工联能够大大加强并扩大它的影响。接着的任务就是，保证这个计划的实现。但是，为了实现这个计划必须把其中的某些规定具体化。
    世界工联书记处计划组织世界工联和它的工会国际的工作人员到一些国家去作若干次访问，以就地研究情况并对工会组织提供实际帮助，我们认为这个计划是绝对正确的。
    我们认为，在目前的情况下，当经济总危机正在加深、资本主义和殖民地国家的劳动人民的生活条件日益恶化的时候，加强世界工联在联合国经社理事会以及在国际劳工组织中的活动是有日益迫切的需要的。
    在联合国经社理事会中，世界工联的代表，必须帮助客观地分析劳动人民的经济状况并必须揭露工人运动中的反动领袖们的违反工人利益的政策。
    在执行世界工会第三次代表大会的决议时，世界工联应该考虑每一个资本主义国家、殖民地国家和半殖民地国家的民族与经济条件。
    世界工联必须根据这些特点并对它们加以研究后，在不改变我们组织的纲领和会章的基本原则下，决定它的活动方针。
    因此，世界工联在它的实际工作中应该考虑各国工会中心的意见和建议。
    执行局必须表明它对世界和平理事会提出的在一九五四年举行国际会议的建议的立场。这次会议的目的是要促进国际紧张形势的缓和。我们愿意支持这个建议。世界工联及其所属组织都应该积极参加这次国际会议。世界工联及其所属组织都有责任尽力协助世界和平理事会，使得还没有参加世界工联的各工会组织也能够广泛参加这次会议。
    为了继续维护和平事业，世界工联必须为和平解决朝鲜问题、停止印度支那战争以及巩固世界和平而不懈地努力。
    我们认为执行局有必要向世界工联书记处和各国的工会组织提出建议，要它们加强解释和执行世界工会第三次代表大会决议的工作。
    同样有必要提起世界工联书记处的注意：它应该加强工人们的反对巴黎与波恩军国主义条约的斗争。
    世界工联必须促使欧洲各国的工会、首先是德国以及德国各邻国的工人阶级，制止德国军国主义和复仇主义的再起，因为德国军国主义和复仇主义是和平与国际安全的严重威胁。
    最后，关于国际贸易问题，执行局应该号召各国的工会组织与工人们为扩大西方与东方的经济及贸易关系而努力，以便巩固各国间的和平关系和提高资本主义国家、殖民地与各附属国家的生活水平。
    在这次会议上通过的执行局的决议，将进一步加强世界工联在广大的工厂工人、机关职员与知识分子中间的影响。
    坚持不渝地执行世界工会第三次代表大会和执行局的决议，将在加强国际工人运动的团结上获得新的胜利。
