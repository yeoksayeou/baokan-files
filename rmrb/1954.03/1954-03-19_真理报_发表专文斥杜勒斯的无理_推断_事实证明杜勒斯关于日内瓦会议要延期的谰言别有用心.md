Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 18th: TASS, Moscow, March 18th: "Pravda" published an article today entitled "Mr. Dulles' Baseless Deductions."

The article states: U.S. Secretary of State Mr. Dulles held a press conference in Washington on March 16th. In the United States, it has become a custom for press conferences to be used as a tool to force American newspapers to accept the State Department's views, and this time was no exception. After Dulles elaborated on the official position on various international issues to reporters, he took the opportunity to express his views on some questions raised by reporters regarding the convening of the Geneva Conference.

Dulles told reporters that after he returned from Caracas, he knew that the State Department had discovered "some signs proving that Moscow was adopting delaying tactics in the actual arrangements for holding the meeting." After listing these baseless "signs," Dulles added: "Now there seems to be the impression that the Chinese Communists are not entirely happy with the arrangements made for them. The Chinese originally hoped to become one of the so-called five major powers. They were rejected on this point, so the Soviet Union has some explaining to do, which may result in a delay."

When asked if the current situation would postpone the Geneva Conference, Dulles replied affirmatively that it was "conceivable."

Dulles knew that his remarks were unfounded because he could not produce any facts to prove them, so he explained that what he said above was his "deduction."

However, as the saying goes, facts speak louder than words.

If we put aside the very strange "deductions" derived from Dulles' unique logic and look at the facts, then the situation is completely different. As everyone knows, the Berlin Conference reached an agreement to convene a Geneva Conference on April 26th, with representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, as well as representatives from other relevant countries. It can be seen that this agreement stipulates that representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China and representatives of major powers such as the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will jointly discuss the Korean issue and the Indochina issue.

In addition, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs also notified the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on March 3rd that the Government of the People's Republic of China had agreed to participate in the Geneva Conference.

All these facts do not provide any basis for Dulles' "deductions." It must be pointed out that Dulles's fabrication about the Soviet Union adopting "delaying tactics" is unfounded. On the contrary, the Soviet Union has consistently and firmly advocated that there should be no obstacles to hinder the organizational and technical work in preparing for the Geneva Conference. As everyone knows, on March 17th, the Soviet government expressed its views on many issues related to the practical measures for preparing for the Geneva Conference. All of this is also a fact. Judging from the above facts, isn't it more correct to say that Mr. Dulles' "deductions" about the possible postponement of the Geneva Conference do not explain the real situation, but only reveal ulterior motives?

### “真理报”发表专文斥杜勒斯的无理“推断”  事实证明杜勒斯关于日内瓦会议要延期的谰言别有用心

    “真理报”发表专文斥杜勒斯的无理“推断”
    事实证明杜勒斯关于日内瓦会议要延期的谰言别有用心
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”今天刊载一篇文章，题目是“杜勒斯先生的毫无根据的推断”。
    文章中写道：美国国务卿杜勒斯先生于三月十六日在华盛顿举行了记者招待会。在美国已经成为一种风气，记者招待会历来被当作强制美国报纸接受国务院的观点的工具，这一次也是这样。杜勒斯向记者阐述了官方对各种国际问题的说法之后，就利用这个机会对记者提出的关于召开日内瓦会议的一些问题表示了意见。
    杜勒斯向记者说道，当他从加拉加斯回来之后，他知道国务院发现有“一些迹象，证明莫斯科在举行会议的实际安排方面采取拖延策略”。杜勒斯在列举这些毫无根据的“迹象”以后还说：“现在似乎有这种印象：中国共产党人对于为他们所作的安排并不完全感到愉快。中国人本来希望成为所谓五大国之一。他们在这一点上遭到了拒绝，所以苏联就有一些解释工作要作，结果就可能造成延迟。”
    有人问目前局势是否会使日内瓦会议延期，杜勒斯肯定地答复说，这是“可以想像的”。
    杜勒斯知道他的谈话是没有根据的，因为他举不出事实来证明，所以他解释道，他上面所说的话是他的“推断”。
    然而，常言说得好，事实胜于雄辩。
    如果抛开杜勒斯独特的逻辑所引伸出来的十分奇怪的“推断”而来看看事实的话，那么，情况便完全不同了。大家知道，柏林会议达成了协议，要在四月二十六日召开美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国代表以及其他有关国家的代表参加的日内瓦会议。可见，这个协议规定中华人民共和国政府的代表和美、英、法、苏等大国的代表，共同讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题。
    此外，苏联外交部还在三月三日通知美、英、法三国政府：中华人民共和国政府已同意参加日内瓦会议。
    所有这些事实都没有为杜勒斯的“推断”提供任何根据。不能不指出，杜勒斯胡诌什么苏联采取“拖延策略”的论调是没有根据的。相反的是，苏联一直坚决主张：不应有任何障碍，使准备日内瓦会议的组织和技术性工作发生困难。大家知道，三月十七日苏联政府就有关准备日内瓦会议的实际措施的许多问题表示了自己的意见。所有这一切也都是事实。从以上的事实看来，杜勒斯先生关于日内瓦会议可能延迟的“推断”不能说明真实情况，而只是说明别有用心，这样说，不是更正确些吗？
