Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 28th: Tens of millions of livestock in the vast pastoral and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas of Northwest China have successively left winter pastures and are moving to spring pastures. Governments at all levels have successively dispatched large numbers of working cadres to go deep into pastoral areas to guide herdsmen in spring grazing and the prevention and control of animal diseases. In some areas where winter and spring pastures are far apart, working cadres have also organized herdsmen to discuss the time, routes, and order of the transfer in advance. In most of the semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas of Xinjiang Province, heavy snowfalls not long ago have affected the livestock transfer work. The special commissioner's offices have sent working groups to various places to specifically guide herdsmen in disaster prevention and animal protection. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Animal Husbandry Department has also organized transportation forces to promptly transport fodder to various places to ensure livestock survive the spring. Local People's Banks have begun issuing livestock protection loans to help herdsmen solve the problem of fodder shortages in early spring.

Last spring and summer, some areas of Northwest China experienced drought and fodder shortages. In order to protect livestock and ensure their safe overwintering, governments at all levels dispatched large numbers of cadres before winter to go deep into pastures to help people of all ethnic groups carry out mass movements for fodder harvesting, pen repair, and wolf hunting, based on unity. According to incomplete statistics, herdsmen throughout the region harvested and stored more than 3.8 billion catties of winter fodder, built and repaired more than 52,000 sheds and pens, killed more than 9,600 wolves, dug more than 180 springs, and dug 510 wells, which played a significant role in protecting livestock through the winter. Herdsmen in some areas paid attention to winter lambing work, so the survival rate of lambs was relatively high. For example, the winter lamb survival rate in Qinghai Province is generally above 80 percent. Herdsmen in spring lambing areas are also currently busy preparing for lambing or are in the process of lambing. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups have also formulated patriotic plans to increase and protect livestock, striving for a large increase in livestock production this year to support industrial and agricultural production.

    西北数千万头牲畜转向春季牧场
   【新华社西安二十八日电】西北广大牧业区、半农半牧区的数千万头牲畜已陆续离开冬季牧场，向春季牧场转移。各级人民政府曾先后派出大批工作干部，深入牧区指导牧民进行春牧和防治兽疫工作。部分冬、春牧场相距较远的地区，工作干部并事先组织牧民群众商定了转移的时间、路线和次序。新疆省大部分半农半牧区，由于不久前降落大雪，影响牲畜转移工作，各专署已派出工作组赶赴各地具体指导牧民防灾保畜，新疆省人民政府畜牧厅并组织运输力量，及时把草料运往各地，保证牲畜过春。各地人民银行开始发放保畜贷款，帮助牧民解决初春缺草等困难问题。
    去年春、夏两季西北部分地区天旱草缺，各地人民政府为了保护牲畜安全过冬工作，入冬前，各地人民政府曾派出大批干部，深入牧场帮助各族牧民在团结的基础上开展了群众性的打草、修圈、打狼等保畜运动。据不完全统计，全区牧民共割储冬草三十八亿多斤，搭修棚圈五万二千多个，打狼九千六百多只，挖泉一百八十多处，打井五百一十口，对于保护牲畜过冬起了很大作用。部分地区牧民重视冬季接羔工作，因而羔羊的成活率都比较高。如青海省冬季羔羊成活率一般都在百分之八十以上。春季产羔地区的牧民，目前也正在紧张地准备接羔或正在进行接羔工作。各族牧民还订出爱国增畜保畜计划，争取今年牲畜大增产，以支援工业、农业生产。
