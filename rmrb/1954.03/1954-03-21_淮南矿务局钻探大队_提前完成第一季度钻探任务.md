    Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team
    Completes First Quarter Drilling Task Ahead of Schedule
    The Huainan Mining Bureau Drilling Team has completed this year's first quarter drilling task twenty-eight days ahead of schedule, according to national standards. Among them, the ninth team, which exceeded its monthly targets every month, completed its drilling task for the first half of the year on March 13. The hydrological work, which was relatively weak in the past, has also made great progress in the first quarter.
    The Huainan Drilling Team achieved fruitful results in completing the first quarter's task. In addition to collecting the geological data of the Laishanjie well field in advance, they also discovered new, well-developed coal seams outside the planned drilling line in the Laishanjie well field. At the same time, they confirmed that there are seventeen well-developed coal seams buried between 330 meters and 600 meters underground in the Datong Mine. The early provision of these underground data provides a reliable basis for the Huainan Coal Mine to build new mines and extend the life of old mines.

    淮南矿务局钻探大队
    提前完成第一季度钻探任务
    淮南矿务局钻探大队已按照国家规定的标准，提前二十八天完成了今年第一季度的钻探任务。其中月月超额完成任务的第九组，在三月十三日就完成了今年上半年的钻探任务。过去比较薄弱的水文工作，第一季度也做了很多。
    淮南钻探大队在完成第一季度任务中得到了丰硕的收获。他们除了提前搜集好癞山集井田区的地质资料以外，还在癞山集井田区原计划的钻探线以外，发现了新的发育良好的煤层。同时，他们证实在大通矿三百三十公尺以下、六百公尺以上的地下，埋藏有十七层发育很正规的煤层。这些地下资料的及早提出，就使得淮南煤矿建设新的矿井和延长老矿井的寿命有了可靠的依据。
