The more than six hundred and thirty people's representatives elected in the general election in Changchun City have established broad connections with the voters, enabling the first district people's congresses held in each district to fully reflect the opinions of the voters and receive their deep concern.

Before the convocation of the people's congresses in each district of Changchun City, each representative conducted two to five visits, propagandas, and symposiums among the voters. In these activities, they repeatedly publicized the significance of convening the district people's congresses to the voters and widely collected proposals. Some representatives even brought the work reports that had been prepared in advance by the district people's governments to the voters and grassroots cadres to solicit opinions. The election committees of each district did a lot of work to assist the people's representatives in carrying out these activities. The Fourth District Election Committee specifically convened a meeting of the heads of various government agencies and units in the district, requesting them to support the activities of the people's representatives.

Encouraged by the enthusiasm of the voters, the representatives conscientiously fulfilled their functions at the first district people's congresses. When electing members of the district people's governments, they reviewed and compared each candidate, and when discussing candidates, they were generally able to express their opinions of agreement or disagreement face to face. The people's representatives of each district also expressed their full opinions on the work reports of the district people's governments over the past year. The people's representatives of the Fifth District pointed out some shortcomings in the work report of the people's government, and their opinions were ultimately written into the resolution to urge the government to overcome these shortcomings. The people's governments of each district seriously handled and answered the proposals of the people. Regarding the opinions raised by the masses concerning criticism of cadres, they immediately conducted self-criticism and took appropriate actions. The Changchun City Cooperative General Agency also sent representatives to the people's congresses of each district to review the shortcomings in their work that had been criticized by the masses, and made comprehensive improvements in the service attitude of employees and the supply of non-staple foods. Now, the masses praised: "The city's cooperatives have all changed."

The proposals collected by the people's representatives reflected the people's concern for national affairs. Some voters in the Fourth District put forward three proposals that should be resolved uniformly at the national level, such as the unified system of weights and measures, and the representative conference has transferred these proposals to the Central People's Government for processing. The content of many voters' and people's representatives' proposals is closely related to the implementation of the general line. A voter in the Second District, based on his personal experience, suggested to the conference that when publicizing the general line among street residents, first introduce the happy life of the Soviet people, and then explain our country's general line, which is easier for the masses to accept and has a greater effect. The district is now preparing to fully promote this method. Many representatives also criticized their own idea of ​​"everything is waiting to be done" without regard to the overall situation at the conference in accordance with the spirit of the general line.

The people's congresses of each district have made resolutions centered on publicizing and implementing the general line. Now, the representatives are widely meeting with voters to convey the spirit of the meeting. The members of the Fourth District People's Government are assigned to regions to gather with representatives regularly to help them conduct general line education for residents. The representatives of each district also assisted the government in training more than 10,000 grassroots cadres in the streets to help the masses study the general line, so that 90% of adults in the city have received more than three educations. When explaining the general line to residents, three people's representatives of Chongqing Street in the Fourth District not only dispelled the impatient demands of some residents to build cinemas and parks, but also personally led the residents' groups to formulate production increase and economy plans.

    长春市内各区人民代表密切联系群众
    使各区首届人民代表大会开得很好
    在普选中当选的长春市市内六百三十多名人民代表，和选民们建立了广泛的联系，使各区召开的首届区人民代表大会充分反映了选民的意见并受到选民们的深切关怀。
    长春市内各区在召开人民代表大会以前，各个代表都在选民中进行了两次到五次访问、宣传和座谈。在这些活动中，他们反复向选民宣传了召开区人民代表大会的意义，并广泛地搜集提案。有的代表还将区人民政府提前印好的工作报告带给选民和基层干部征求意见。各区选举委员会为协助人民代表进行这些活动，都作了很多工作。第四区选举委员会曾专门召集了区内各机关单位的负责人开会，要求他们支持人民代表的活动。
    在选民们的热情鼓舞下，代表们在第一次区人民代表大会上都认真地履行他们的职能。在选举区人民政府委员时，对每一个候选人都进行了审查评比，在讨论候选人时，他们大都能够当面提出同意或不同意的意见。各区的人民代表对区人民政府一年来的工作报告也都发表了充分的意见。五区人民代表对人民政府的工作报告指出了一些缺点，他们的意见最后被写进决议里，以便督促政府克服这些缺点。各区人民政府对人民群众的提案都作了严肃的处理和解答。对群众所提出的有关对干部批评的意见，都立即进行了检讨，而加以适当处理。长春市合作总社还派出了代表向各区的人民代表大会检讨了他们为群众所指责的工作中的缺点，并在社内职员的服务态度和副食品供应等方面作了全面的改进。现在，群众赞扬说：“全市合作社都变样了。”
    人民代表所征集的提案中，反映了人民对于国家大事的关怀。四区有的选民提出了统一度量衡制度等三件应在全国范围内统一解决的提案，代表大会已将这些提案转交中央人民政府处理。许多选民和人民代表的提案内容都和贯彻总路线的问题有着密切的联系。二区一个选民根据他亲身体会向大会建议在街道居民中宣传总路线时，首先介绍苏联人民的幸福生活，再解释我们国家的总路线，群众容易接受，效果较大。现在该区准备全面推广这个方法。不少代表在大会上还按照总路线的精神，批判了自己那种“百废俱兴”不顾全局的思想。
    各区的人民代表大会都作出了以宣传贯彻总路线为中心的决议。现在，代表们正广泛地和选民见面，传达会议的精神。四区人民政府委员按地区分工定期和代表集会，帮助他们向居民进行总路线教育。各区代表还协助政府在街道中训练了一万多名帮助群众学习总路线的基层干部，使市内百分之九十的成年人受到了三次以上的教育。四区重庆街的三名人民代表在向居民讲解总路线时，不仅打消了部分居民主张立即修建电影院、公园等不急迫的要求，还亲自领导居民小组订立了增产节约计划。
