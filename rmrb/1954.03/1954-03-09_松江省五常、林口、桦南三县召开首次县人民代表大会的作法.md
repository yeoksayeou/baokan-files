    Practices of Wuchang, Linkou, and Huanan Counties in Songjiang Province in Convening Their First County People's Congresses
    Zhang Weiqun
    Wuchang, Linkou, and Huanan counties in Songjiang Province convened their county People's Congresses in mid-to-late December last year. The People's Congresses of these three counties were relatively successful and gained some experience due to strong leadership, thorough preparation, genuine promotion of democracy, and especially the ability to use the spirit of the general line as the guiding ideology of the congress.
    Before convening the People's Congresses, the three counties conducted extensive publicity and education work. Before the publicity, some cadres did not sufficiently recognize the importance of the People's Congresses, or thought that the People's Congresses were no different from the previous People's Representative Conferences, or had the idea of "none of my business," disliked trouble, and were indifferent. In response to this situation, each county first started with improving the ideological understanding of cadres, so as to carry out publicity and education from cadres to the masses. In the three counties, responsible cadres made reports at the meetings of all cadres directly under the county, and various units conducted discussions and discussions separately. All districts generally transmitted and arranged meetings at the district-wide party member meetings or party branch secretaries' and village heads' joint meetings. After that, each county organized a strong propaganda force to go deep into the countryside and streets, combining with the central work to conduct extensive publicity to the masses. In addition to focusing on publicizing the superiority of the People's Congresses and the democratic nature of the election, the counties also paid attention to closely combining the publicity of the convening of the county People's Congresses with the publicity of the general line of the state's transition period, so as to make it a driving force for promoting current work. After the Bancheng Hezi Village in Huanan County publicized the general line and general tasks to the masses, it pointed out that it is necessary to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, convene the county People's Congress to elect leaders of the whole county on the basis of the successful conclusion of the grass-roots elections, so as to lead the people of the whole county to realize the general line and general tasks of the state's transition period. After such publicity, the masses were greatly encouraged and unanimously supported the convening of the county People's Congress. People's Representative Sun Changshan immediately took the lead in selling 5,500 jin of surplus grain, which smoothly completed the village's grain purchase plan and exceeded 10,000 jin.
    Before convening the county People's Congresses, the three counties fully studied the central topics of the congress and prepared the work reports of the congress well. Before determining the central topics, the secretaries of the county party committees of Wuchang and Linkou counties personally led working groups to investigate the situation, and the county party committees discussed them many times. This made the central topics fully in line with the actual situation of the county, and solved the existing problems effectively. Huanan County originally planned to take winter production and safe transportation of public grain and grain purchases as the central topics. After the working group went deep into understanding, it found that the masses were most concerned about and urgently demanded, in addition to winter production, the issue of horse feed supply. There were 81 proposals related to this issue. Secondly, because farmers had a lot of cash after selling grain, some people ate, drank, and squandered waste. Therefore, strengthening rural economic work, including winter production and supply and marketing work, was listed as the central topic.
    When preparing various work reports, the above three counties also focused on checking and summarizing the key issues in production in the past few years, and put forward opinions on future production. For example, various work reports in Wuchang County have clear purposes: the report on the general line is the guiding ideology of the congress, and is the criterion for reviewing the government work report and discussing the central topics; the purpose of the government work report is to summarize the experience of leading production, overcome shortcomings, promote democracy, and improve leadership; the report on future work opinions is to specifically implement the general line. Therefore, the government work report focused on checking and summarizing central tasks such as agricultural production and mutual assistance and cooperation; the report on future work opinions mainly put forward issues such as winter production, mutual assistance and cooperation, and grain purchases, and put forward specific methods. This not only made the central topics of various work reports prominent, but also made the content simple and concise.
    The generation of representatives to the county People's Congresses reflected the principle of working-class leadership, while also taking into account the broadness of the representatives. The number of worker representatives in the People's Representatives of the three counties has increased compared with the past People's Representative Conferences. Since the three counties are mainly engaged in agricultural production, farmer representatives accounted for a large proportion. The three counties adopted two different methods for the generation of representatives: the first is to jointly nominate by party branches, village people's governments, women's federations, youth leagues, etc., and then deliberate and discuss in voter groups or mutual aid groups, and finally determine formal representative candidates according to the opinions of the majority of the masses, and elect them at the village People's Congress; the second is to nominate by the masses and elect them at the village People's Congress. Experience has proved that the first method is the best and the best method of combining leadership and the masses.
    The counties had collected proposals before the meeting. The main methods adopted are four kinds: the first is to collect in combination with publicity and education; the second is to collect when convening voter group meetings to deliberate and discuss representative candidates; the third is to collect when convening village People's Congresses to elect county People's Representatives; the fourth is to collect by convening mass forums and individual visits after the representatives are elected. Experience has proved that all four methods can be adopted, especially the latter. If used properly, it will make the relationship between the People's Representatives and the people closer. After the responsible cadres of the county are elected and elected in the village, they must visit the masses to collect proposals.
    The duration of the county People's Congresses was five days for Wuchang and Huanan counties and four and a half days for Linkou County. One of the contents of the People's Congress is to review the work of the government in the past period. This requires, on the one hand, educating county and district cadres on the significance of the People's Congress's review of the work of the People's Government, criticizing the erroneous understanding that reviewing the work of the People's Government at the congress is just a formality and not preparing to humbly listen to the opinions of the representatives to improve their work; on the other hand, it is also necessary to educate the People's Representatives on the powers of the People's Representatives, explaining that reviewing the work of the People's Government is the right and responsibility of every representative. When reviewing the work of the People's Government, we should grasp the key points and guide the representatives to check the main work. We must make the People's Representatives realize that the People's Government has done many good things for the people in the past few years to improve the political consciousness of the People's Representatives; at the same time, we must fully promote democracy so that the representatives dare to boldly criticize the work of the People's Government. If this work is done well, it will greatly help the county oppose bureaucracy and improve leadership. The People's Congresses of the three counties mainly checked agricultural production, followed by supply and marketing work, and combined the checks of local industry, culture, education, health, and political power construction. At the meeting, the representatives spoke freely and their enthusiasm was extremely high. The People's Representatives of Huanan County focused on criticizing the government's phenomenon of being greedy and rash first, and then letting go of the implementation of the policy of mutual assistance and cooperation. They also focused on criticizing the problem of soybean cake out of stock. Worker representatives in Linkou County criticized the People's Government for not having a clear idea of serving production and not paying enough attention to industrial and mining areas. The representatives also exposed and criticized the bureaucratic and commandist work style of some staff members. The representatives also reviewed their shortcomings in the spirit of self-criticism. Many representatives also put forward suggestions for improving work while making criticisms. According to the criticisms and suggestions of the representatives, the People's Government immediately took measures to improve its work.
    Before discussing the central topics, the secretaries of the county party committees made reports on the general line and general tasks, and the representatives were greatly encouraged and had a clearer understanding of the relationship between industry and agriculture and the road of agricultural development. However, when discussing the central topics in connection with the local situation, some representatives still had confused ideas, such as thinking that "there is nothing to do in winter production" and lacking confidence in the work of rectifying, consolidating, and improving mutual aid organizations. Therefore, we should first start with improving the understanding of the representatives and let the representatives put forward the problems and ideological understanding existing in winter production and mutual assistance and cooperation organizations. In response to these problems and ideas, mobilize the representatives to discuss, find out the causes and solutions. Because the congress can fully promote democracy and the wisdom of the masses, many problems have been solved. For example, the main reason for the problems in the mutual assistance and cooperation movement is that party members and cadres in the past did not sufficiently recognize that mutual assistance and cooperation is the only way to implement the general line in agriculture, and relaxed specific leadership. After discussion, it was generally recognized that if mutual assistance and cooperation is not done well, it will be difficult to develop production; the masses have the desire to develop production and also have the desire to organize; coupled with the experience of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in advanced areas, especially after the general line is publicized and the masses' awareness is further improved, the mutual assistance and cooperation movement will be greatly developed. Therefore, the representatives were full of confidence. Representatives from the central village of Wuchang County originally thought that "there is nothing to do in sideline production." After discussion, they found that there are six or seven kinds of sideline production that have a way out. Representatives of Huanan County came up with various ways of sideline production. If realized, the masses in the county can increase their income by 10.3 billion yuan in winter.
    The People's Congresses of the three counties made resolutions based on the opinions discussed by the representatives. This is a democratic resolution that comes from the masses and goes to the masses, and it will also become the conscious action of the people of the county.
    In order to handle the proposals of the congress responsibly, the three counties have established proposal review committees. The specific methods for handling proposals are to first register the total amount to understand and grasp the overall situation; secondly, classify them according to different natures such as criticism, suggestions, inquiries, and requirements for separate handling; then separate the issues related to the central topics from the general issues, separate what should be handled from what should be explained, and separate what can be solved immediately from what needs to be solved gradually. Finally, transfer the proposals to the relevant departments. After the proposals are transferred, people are sent to supervise and inspect to ensure the rapid and conscientious handling of the proposals. Most of the proposals received by the Wuchang County Department Store criticized the service attitude of the staff. To this end, the company specifically convened a staff meeting, combined the proposals for inspection, launched a movement to learn from advanced worker Sun Fangzhi, improved business management, and promoted the movement to increase production and save money.
    Proposals related to the central topics are submitted to the congress for discussion, and solutions are added to the resolutions. Proposals that are not related to the central topics but have major problems are also submitted to the People's Congress for discussion to seek solutions. For example, the issue of long-term delayed payment of labor fees in Wuchang County was discussed by the representatives and a resolution was made by the congress. As for individual problems and problems that are difficult to solve for a while, the representatives were also informed at the congress.
    The People's Congresses of the three counties elected county heads, deputy county heads, and government members, and established new county people's governments. The method of nominating candidates for members of the county people's governments in Wuchang and Linkou counties was joint nomination by the county's communist party organizations, people's organizations, the congress presidium, and representative group leaders. Before the joint nomination, the representatives were educated on the democratic essence of the joint nomination method. After the joint list was proposed, the representatives were given detailed introductions to the situation of each government member candidate, and then the representatives were mobilized to carefully identify and repeatedly discuss. The representatives put forward opinions or hopes for each government member candidate in an extremely responsible spirit. This gave each candidate a democratic education. For example, when discussing in Wuchang County, representative Fu Zhenting said: "County Head Zhang can endure hardship, has a stable stand, overcame all difficulties in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and completed the task. In the past few years, he has done many good things for the people. I represent the whole village in electing him to continue as county head." When discussing the candidate for government member and trade union chairman Liu Shande in Huanan County, they criticized his problem of not being thorough enough in his work and asked him to seriously correct it.
    Because the elections in the three counties were carefully carried out in advance, fully promoting democracy and repeated discussions, the elections proceeded smoothly and all candidates were elected. The first People's Congresses of the three counties elected representatives to the provincial People's Congress.
    After the closing of the congress, the three counties adopted many specific measures to implement the resolutions of the congress. Immediately after the meeting, Wuchang County convened the first meeting of the County People's Government Committee to discuss and formulate a work plan for implementing the resolutions, and put forward different methods and requirements for rural areas, cities and towns, and organs and enterprises. To this end, the county party committee issued a notice requiring the district party committees and rural branches to conscientiously implement the resolutions. One hundred and twenty cadres were dispatched to go deep into various districts, villages, and streets to specifically assist the representatives in conveying and implementing the resolutions. Therefore, the people of the county quickly took action. Farmers in the third district sent out more than 300 hectares of fertilizer in nine days and earned more than 7 million yuan in various sideline occupations; representative Gu Tai quickly reorganized and consolidated five mutual aid groups. Under the leadership of the People's Representatives, the resolutions of the county People's Congress have become the actions of the broad masses of the county.

    松江省五常、林口、桦南三县召开首次县人民代表大会的作法
    张维群
    松江省五常、林口、桦南三县在去年十二月中旬和下旬分别召开了县人民代表大会。三县的人民代表大会由于领导较强，准备充分，真正发扬了民主，特别是由于能够以总路线的精神作为大会的指导思想，因而会议开得比较成功，取得了一些经验。
    三县在召开人民代表大会之前，曾进行了广泛的宣传教育工作。未进行宣传之前，有些干部对于人民代表大会的重要性认识不足，或是以为人民代表大会和过去的人民代表会议没有什么两样，也有人抱着“与我无关”的想法，嫌麻烦，而不闻不问。根据这种情况，各县首先从提高干部的思想认识入手，以便从干部到群众展开宣传教育。三县都由负责干部在县直属机关全体干部会议上作了报告，各单位分别进行了座谈和讨论，各区则普遍地在全区党员大会或党支部书记、村长联席会上作了传达布置。之后，各县都组织了较强的宣传力量，深入农村、街道，结合中心工作，向群众进行了广泛的宣传。各县除着重宣传了人民代表大会的优越性及选举的民主性之外，并注意使召开县人民代表大会的宣传和国家过渡时期总路线的宣传密切结合起来，使之成为推动当前工作的动力。桦南县半截河子村向群众宣传了总路线总任务后指出：必须进一步巩固人民民主专政的政权，在基层选举胜利结束的基础上召开县人民代表大会选举全县的领导人，以便领导全县人民实现国家过渡时期的总路线总任务。经过这样宣传之后，群众受到很大鼓舞，一致拥护县人民代表大会的召开。县人民代表孙长善立即带头出卖余粮五千五百斤，使全村购粮计划顺利完成，而且超过一万斤。
    三县在召开县人民代表大会之前，对于大会的中心议题作了充分的研究，并很好地准备了大会的工作报告。五常、林口两县在确定中心议题之前，由县委书记亲率工作组下去调查情况，并经县委会议多次讨论。这样就使中心议题和全县的实际情况完全符合，针对存在的问题加以切实解决。桦南县原来准备以冬季生产、公粮和购粮的安全运输作为中心议题，后经工作组深入了解，发现群众当前最关心和最迫切的要求，除冬季生产外，就是马料供应问题，有关此项问题的提案达八十一件；其次，由于农民卖粮后，有大量现款，有人大吃大喝、挥霍浪费；因此就把加强农村经济工作包括冬季生产和供销工作列为中心议题了。
    上述三县在准备各项工作报告时，也都以检查与总结几年来生产中的关键问题为中心，并对今后生产提出意见。如五常县各项工作报告均有明确的目的：总路线的报告是大会的指导思想，是审查政府工作报告和讨论中心议题的准绳；政府工作报告的目的是总结领导生产的经验，克服缺点，发扬民主，改进领导；今后工作意见的报告，是具体地贯彻总路线。因此，在政府工作报告中，着重检查与总结了农业生产与互助合作等中心工作；在今后工作意见的报告中，主要提出了冬季生产、互助合作与购粮等问题，并提出具体办法。这样不仅使各项工作报告中心突出，且内容也简单扼要。
    县人民代表大会代表的产生，体现了工人阶级领导的原则，同时又照顾了代表的广泛性。三县的人民代表中，工人代表比过去人民代表会议的名额均有增加。由于三县都以农业生产为主，农民代表占了很大的比例。代表的产生，三个县采取了两种不同的方法：第一种是由党支部、村人民政府、妇联、青年团等单位联合提名，然后以选民小组或互助组为单位酝酿讨论，最后按照多数群众的意见确定正式代表候选人，在村人民代表大会上选举产生；第二种是由群众提名，在村人民代表大会上选举产生。经验证明，第一种方法最好，是领导与群众相结合的最好方法。
    各县会前曾进行了搜集提案的工作。采取的方法主要有四种：第一种是结合宣传教育进行搜集；第二种是在召开选民小组会酝酿讨论代表候选人时搜集；第三种是在召开村人民代表大会选举县人民代表时搜集；第四种是在代表选出后采取召开群众座谈会和个别访问的方法搜集。经验证明，四种方法都可以采用，特别是后一种，如果运用得当，会使人民代表和人民群众的关系更加密切。县负责干部在村应选并当选后，更必须访问群众，搜集提案。
    县人民代表大会的会期，五常、桦南二县为五天，林口县为四天半。人民代表大会的内容之一，是审查政府过去一个时期的工作。这就需要一方面向县区干部进行由人民代表大会审查人民政府工作的意义的教育，批判那种认为在大会上审查人民政府工作只是“走走”形式，而不准备虚心听取代表的意见来改进自己的工作的错误认识；另一方面，也必须向人民代表进行人民代表的职权的教育，说明审查人民政府工作是每一个代表的权利和责任。在审查人民政府工作时，应该掌握重点，引导代表检查主要工作。必须使人民代表认识到人民政府几年来给人民办了许多好事，以提高人民代表的政治觉悟；同时，也必须充分发扬民主，使代表敢于大胆地对人民政府工作提出批评。这一工作作好了，对县的反对官僚主义改进领导有很大帮助。三县的人民代表大会都是以检查农业生产为主，供销工作为次，结合检查了地方工业、文教、卫生、政权建设等项工作。会上，代表畅所欲言，情绪极为高涨。桦南县人民代表着重批评了政府贯彻互助合作政策先贪多冒进、后又放任自流的现象，还着重批评了豆饼脱销问题。林口县工人代表批评人民政府为生产服务的思想不明确，对工矿地区注意不够。代表们对某些工作人员的官僚主义、命令主义的工作作风也进行了揭发和批评。代表们也本着自我批评的精神，检讨了自己的缺点。许多代表更在进行批评同时，提出了改进工作的建议。根据代表们的批评和建议，人民政府立即采取了改进工作的措施。
    各县在讨论中心议题之前，都由县委书记作了关于总路线总任务的报告，代表们受到很大鼓舞，对工农业之间的关系和农业发展的道路有了较明确的认识。但在联系本地情况，讨论中心议题时，部分代表仍有着糊涂思想，如认为“冬季生产无啥可搞”，对整顿、巩固和提高互助组织的工作也缺乏信心。因此，就先从提高代表认识入手，让代表们提出冬季生产和互助合作组织中存在的问题和思想认识。针对这些问题和思想，发动代表讨论，找出产生的原因和解决的办法。因为大会能充分发扬民主，发扬群众的智慧，许多问题都得到解决。如互助合作运动中发生问题的主要原因是党员和干部过去对互助合作是在农业方面贯彻总路线的唯一道路认识不足，而放松了具体领导。经过讨论之后，普遍认识到如果不搞好互助合作，生产就很难发展；群众有发展生产的要求，也有组织起来的要求；加上先进地区互助合作运动的经验，特别是在宣传过总路线，群众觉悟进一步提高之后，互助合作运动会得到很大发展。因此，代表们都充满了信心。五常县中心村代表原来认为“副业无啥可搞”，经过讨论，发现有六、七种副业生产有出路。桦南县代表想出了各种副业生产的门路，如果实现后全县群众在冬季可增加收入一百零三亿元。
    三县人民代表大会根据代表们讨论的意见，做出了大会决议。这是从群众中来到群众中去的民主决议，也将成为全县人民的自觉行动。
    为了认真负责地处理大会提案，三县都成立了提案审查委员会。处理提案的具体作法，是首先进行总的登记，以了解和掌握全面情况；其次，按批评、建议、询问、要求等不同性质加以分类，以便分别处理；然后把有关中心议题和一般性的问题分开，把应该处理和应该解释的分开，把可以立即解决的和需要逐步解决的分开。最后把提案转交有关部门。提案转出后，即派人进行监督、检查，以保证提案的迅速和认真处理。五常县百货公司收到的提案，大部分是批评工作人员的服务态度的，该公司为此专门召开了工作人员大会，结合提案进行检查，发起学习先进工作者孙芳芝的运动，改进了经营管理，并推动了增产节约运动。
    提案中有关中心议题的，都交大会讨论，解决办法加到决议中去。与中心议题无关但问题重大的提案，也交代表大会进行讨论，求得解决。如五常县的长期拖延代耕费的问题，由代表作了讨论，并由大会作出决议。至于个别问题和一时尚难解决的问题，也在大会上向代表作了交代。
    三县的人民代表大会都选举了县长、副县长和政府委员，成立了新的县人民政府。县人民政府委员候选人的提名的方法，五常、林口两县是由县的共产党组织、人民团体与大会主席团、代表组长等联合提名，在联合提名前，并向代表进行了关于联合提名方式的民主实质的教育，提出联合名单后，又向代表详细介绍了每一个政府委员候选人的情况，然后发动代表认真鉴别，反复讨论。代表们以极其认真负责的精神，给每个政府委员候选人提出意见或希望。这使每一个候选人都受到一次民主的教育。如五常县在讨论时，代表傅振庭说：“张县长能吃苦，立场稳，在抗美援朝中克服一切困难，完成了任务，这几年给人民办了许多好事，我代表全村选他继续当县长。”桦南县在讨论政府委员候选人工会主席刘善德时，曾批评他工作不够深入的毛病，要求他认真改正。
    三县的选举因为事先进行了细致的工作，作到充分发扬民主，反复讨论，选举进行得都很顺利，候选人全部当选。三县首次人民代表大会上都选举了出席省人民代表大会的代表。
    三县在大会闭幕后，都采取了许多具体办法贯彻大会决议。五常县在会后立即召开了县人民政府委员会第一次会议，讨论和制订了贯彻执行决议的工作计划，对农村、城镇和机关企业提出了不同的方法和要求。县委并为此发出通知，要求区委和农村支部认真贯彻决议。并派出一百二十名干部，深入各区、村、街道具体协助代表传达贯彻决议。因此，全县人民就很快行动起来。第三区农民在九天之内送出三百多垧地的粪，在各种副业中收入七百余万元；代表谷太很快的就把五个互助组重新整顿巩固起来。县人民代表大会的决议，在人民代表带头贯彻执行下，已变成全县广大群众的行动。
