    We Must Lead Farmers to Solve the Fertilizer Shortage Problem
    ——Reader Letters and Commentary
     Pei Guoxun
    Reasonably increasing the application of fertilizer is an important link in ensuring increased production of grain, cotton, hemp, and other crops. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, readers report that some areas still have a fertilizer shortage. For example, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in Heilongjiang Province is less than half of what should be applied. In Qin County and Licheng County, Shanxi Province, the existing fertilizer only reaches about 60% of the planned fertilization amount. In Muqiao Village, Xinyu Township, Nan County, Hunan Province, 515 mu of the 935 mu of cultivated land currently have no fertilizer to apply. According to our understanding, this situation is not isolated. Therefore, how to solve the fertilizer shortage problem for farmers has become a noteworthy issue at present.
    The main reason for the fertilizer shortage in some areas this year is that county and district leaders in these areas relaxed their leadership over fertilizer accumulation work during the winter production period. According to readers, the leading organs in Rongcheng and Qingyuan counties, Hebei Province, did not pay enough attention to how to carry out the general election work around production. As a result, many district and village cadres were only busy "rushing to complete tasks" and did not actively lead farmers to accumulate fertilizer. Another reason is that some cadres have a blindly complacent mentality. As Jiangxi reader Xiong Yan wrote, "Some cadres believe that after the general line was publicized, the farmers' awareness has increased, and it is no longer necessary to put in much effort in production." Reader Liang Zhongjiang also wrote, "Some cadres in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, and other places say that production work is the same old thing, and it is not necessary to lead it." Because cadres lacked leadership in fertilizer accumulation work, local farmers did not accumulate fertilizer seriously. For example, in Hengchenghao Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, more than 200 pigs were scattered outside and no one cared about them, so a large amount of pig manure could not be collected. In some rural areas of Huayang County, Sichuan Province, there are abundant sources of natural fertilizer, but cadres have not actively led the masses to develop them.
    Some county and district leaders in some areas, although they also realize that the farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased, the investment in production has increased, and the demand for fertilizer has also increased, and they have begun to pay attention to leading the work of fertilizer accumulation. However, since they do not start from improving their own leadership methods to solve the fertilizer problem, they are only satisfied with general meeting arrangements and appeals. Before the arrangements, they do not investigate the shortage of fertilizer, and they do not understand the local people's original habits of accumulating fertilizer. After the arrangements, they lack in-depth inspection and supervision, and they fail to solve the problems existing among the masses. As a result, although there are arrangements, the figures for fertilizer accumulation still cannot meet the needs. Some county and district leaders even, to some extent, have the idea of relying on the higher authorities to allocate commercial fertilizers. It should be pointed out that this generalized leadership method and the idea of relying on the supply of commercial fertilizers from higher authorities are very harmful. It must be recognized that only by going deep into the countryside, and truly grasping the situation of manure fertilizer, and being clear about it, can we specifically lead the work of fertilizer accumulation. At the same time, it must also be recognized that the state's supply of commercial fertilizers can only be gradually increased under the current circumstances, and cannot fully meet the needs of farmers. Facts have proved that as long as all localities attach importance to fertilizer accumulation work, actively lead farmers to explore fertilizer sources in accordance with local conditions, and carry out mass fertilizer accumulation work, the fertilizer shortage phenomenon can be overcome. The Fodangling Zhang Shuangquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, mobilized its members to research and come up with fourteen ways to find fertilizer sources, such as cleaning chicken coops, fumigating barren manure, and beating kang soil. The entire cooperative launched a fertilizer accumulation competition and accumulated more than 3,700 dan of fertilizer in ten days.
    The spring plowing season is coming, wheat fields need topdressing, and autumn fields need basal fertilizer. Solving the fertilizer problem is a very urgent task. After the farmers have studied the general line, their enthusiasm for production has been further improved. As long as the county and district leading organs attach importance to this issue and actively carry out leadership and organization, they will use their wisdom and strength to solve this difficulty. At the same time, fertilizer production units should further tap their potential and increase production on the basis of existing production equipment according to the needs of the masses. Fertilizer supply units should also actively organize fertilizer sources and supply the stored fertilizer to the farmers who need it most in time to support agricultural production and help farmers solve the fertilizer shortage problem.

    必须领导农民解决缺肥问题
    ——读者来信述评
  　裴国勋
    合理地增施肥料，是保证增产粮食、棉、麻以及其他作物的一个重要环节。现在春耕季节已到，但据读者反映，部分地区尚有肥料不足的现象。如黑龙江省积肥数量还不及应施肥料的一半。山西沁县、黎城等县，现有肥料仅达计划施肥量的百分之六十左右。湖南南县新鱼乡木桥村九百三十五亩耕地，有五百十五亩田目前还没有肥料可施。根据我们了解，这种情况并不是个别的。因此，如何解决农民的缺肥问题就成为当前一个值得注意的问题。
    今年某些地区肥料不足的主要原因，是这些地区的县、区领导干部在冬季生产期间对积肥工作放松了领导。据读者反映，河北容城、清苑等县的领导机关，在进行普选工作时，对如何围绕生产去进行普选工作的问题注意不够。这样，不少区、村干部就只忙于“赶任务”，而不去积极领导农民积肥。另一个原因是，有一些干部存在着盲目自满的思想。如江西读者熊焰来信反映：“有的干部认为宣传总路线后，农民觉悟提高了，搞生产再不要费劲了。”读者梁中江也反映：“河北清苑等县有些干部说生产工作是老一套，不领导也可以。”由于干部对积肥工作缺乏领导，当地农民就没有认真积肥。如吉林永吉县恒成号村有二百多口猪散放在外面没人管，大批猪粪就没有能够聚积起来。四川华阳县有些农村有丰富的自然肥的来源，干部没有积极领导群众去开辟。
    有些地区的县、区领导干部，虽然也认识到目前农民的生产积极性提高了，生产投资增加了，需要的肥料也增多了，开始注意领导积肥工作。但由于他们不从改进自己的领导方法着手来解决肥料问题，仅满足于一般的会议布置和号召，在布置以前对缺肥的情况不摸底，对当地群众原有积肥习惯不了解；在布置以后，又缺乏深入的检查督促，解决群众中存在的问题。其结果虽有布置，积肥数字仍然不能满足需要。有些县、区的领导甚至在某种程度上还存在依赖上级调拨商品肥料的思想。应当指出：这种一般化的领导方法与依赖上级供应商品肥料的思想是十分有害的。必须认识：只有深入到农村中去，切实掌握粪肥情况，做到心中有数，才能具体领导积肥工作。同时，也必须认识：国家供应商品肥料在目前的情况下只能是逐步增加，尚不能完全满足农民的需要。事实证明：各地只要重视了积肥工作，积极领导农民因地制宜地发掘肥源，开展群众性的积肥工作，肥料不足的现象是可以得到克服的。山西平顺县佛堂岭张双全农业生产合作社发动社员研究出清鸡窝、熏荒粪、打炕土等十四种找肥源的办法，全社展开了积肥竞赛，在十天时间内就积肥三千七百余担。
    春耕季节到来了，麦田需要上追肥，秋田需要上基肥，解决肥料问题是一个十分紧迫的任务。农民群众经过总路线的学习后，生产积极性已进一步提高，只要县、区领导机关重视这个问题，积极进行领导和组织，他们是会用自己的智慧和力量来解决这个困难的。同时，肥料生产单位应该根据群众需要，在既有生产设备的基础上进一步发挥潜力，提高生产；肥料供应单位也应该积极组织肥源，并及时把储备着的肥料供应给最需要的农民，以支持农业生产，帮助农民解决缺肥问题。
