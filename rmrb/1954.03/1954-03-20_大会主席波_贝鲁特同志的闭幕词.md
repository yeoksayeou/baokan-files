Comrades Delegates, our Party's Second Congress has now concluded its work. Our Congress demonstrated a complete unity of purpose, an unwavering and unified will, the unbreakable solidarity of our ranks, and a harmony of aspirations and sentiments. All of this inspired all the delegates present at this Congress and guided the work of this Congress, which is so crucial for the Party, the nation, and the people.

Although some useful, constructive, bold, and incisive criticisms were raised on the platform of this Congress, criticizing the many shortcomings that still exist in the activities of our Party and the state, what does the fact that the Congress was so completely unanimous in adopting resolutions mean?

What does this attitude taken by the delegates, due to their comprehensive concern for the Party, their wholehearted love for the Party, their love for the cause of the Party, and their love for the great tasks decided and formulated by our Second Congress, mean? It means that our Party has become a strong and unbreakable fortress, an unshakable and reliable force. It is closely united with the people, infinitely concerned with the interests of the people.

The Congress proved that since the merger of the Polish Socialist Party and the Workers' Party, our Party has done a great deal of work. It has led the people and guided them with tremendous selfless efforts to build socialism in People's Poland and strengthen the strength of Poland as an integral part of the great camp of peace and socialism led by the Soviet Union.

The Second Congress proved that the invincible ideology of Marxism-Leninism, which inspires our Party and points out the path it should take, is uniting our Party's ranks as firmly as a rock.

The Second Congress proved how our Party has consistently adhered to Lenin's time-tested policy of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance as the only path to the victory of socialist construction.

The Congress proved how our Party has consolidated its ranks, how its members have grown, strengthened, and been tempered in the arduous struggle of building socialism, in the struggle against class enemies and agents of imperialism.

The Second Congress brilliantly demonstrated proletarian internationalism, the connection and solidarity between us and the working masses of capitalist countries, the fraternal cooperation between us and other People's Democratic countries, and our ever-deepening, firm friendship and loyalty to the great Soviet Union—the bastion of the struggle of all progressive humanity for peace, progress, and democracy.

The Second Congress summarized the work we have done and the achievements we have made in implementing the Six-Year Plan and formulated a clear program of work for the coming years. The Congress emphasized the absolute necessity of developing agriculture and rapidly improving the people's living standards.

The Second Congress undoubtedly made a creative contribution to solving the basic problems of our socialist construction—the development and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

The Second Congress proved that criticism and self-criticism are a powerful weapon for the Party to improve its work, correct mistakes and deviations, and expand its ties with the working masses and the broad masses of the people. The Second Congress proved that the Polish United Workers' Party is the vanguard of the people, striving to increase the strength and welfare of the people.

The Second Congress more clearly than before demonstrated the undeniable fact, confirmed by our entire development process, that the progress and happiness of all working people, the progress and happiness of the entire country, depend on the strength and unity of our Party. The Party led the people in the struggle for liberation, and the Party led the people in restoring the country destroyed by the war. The Party has become an inspiring force in the great task of Poland's industrialization. Today, the Party is mobilizing the entire people to carry out the great tasks of rapidly developing agriculture, rapidly improving living standards, and victoriously completing the great Six-Year Plan.

The Party, inheriting the finest progressive traditions of the Polish people, has become the backbone and main force of the National Front. It maintains close ties with the people and leads all working people's organizations—state institutions and public organizations. The entire Party must work based on the understanding of this point, and the newly elected Central Committee of our Party will reallocate our forces based on this point to carry out the tasks set by the Congress.

We will follow the path prescribed by the Second Congress, continue to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, tirelessly improve our agricultural production and the living and cultural standards of the working people, and we will tirelessly improve the economic and defense strength of our people's state.

We want to help millions of people, Party members and non-Party people, to more deeply understand the tasks of our Party in the construction of a new life in People's Poland!

We want to make the people understand the great significance of the great ideas that unite our people, illuminate our entire lives, and are used by the Party to illuminate the path guiding our country towards progress and prosperity.

The Party Constitution adopted by the Second Congress embodies this idea.

We must constantly strive to consolidate our alliance with the Soviet Union in all aspects. We must constantly strive to consolidate our fraternal and combatant ties with the heroic Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which guides the path for all mankind, in all aspects.

Long live the leader of the Polish people, the Polish United Workers' Party!

Long live the collective leadership body of our Party, the Central Committee!

Long live the People's Republic of Poland!

Long live the Polish people!

Advance towards new victories!

Advance towards socialism! (Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, based on TASS)

    大会主席波·贝鲁特同志的闭幕词
    代表同志们，现在，我们党的第二次代表大会已经结束它的工作。我们的代表大会显示了完全一致的目的，不可动摇的、统一的意志，我们队伍的牢不可破的团结以及愿望和感情的一致，这一切都鼓舞了出席这次代表大会的全体代表，并指导了这次对党、对全国和对人民如此紧要的代表大会的工作。
    虽然大家在这次代表大会的讲台上提出了一些有用的、建设性的、大胆的、尖锐的批评，批评我们党和国家的活动中依然存在的许多缺点，代表大会在通过决议时，还是这样完全一致，这个事实意味着什么呢？
    代表们由于全面地关心党、由于全心全意地热爱党，热爱党的事业、热爱我们第二次代表大会所决定并拟订的巨大任务而采取的这种态度又意味着什么呢？这意味着我们的党已经变成了一个强大的、牢不可破的堡垒，变成了一股不可动摇的、可靠的力量。它和人民紧密地团结在一起，无限关怀人民的利益。
    代表大会证明，自从波兰社会党和工人党合并以后，我们的党做了很多的工作，它领导着人民、并引导他们以巨大的忘我的努力来在人民波兰建设社会主义，并加强作为以苏联为首的伟大的和平和社会主义阵营的不可分割的一部分的波兰的力量。
    第二次代表大会证明，鼓舞我们的党并指出它应走的道路的马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的思想正把我们党的队伍团结得像磐石一样坚固。
    第二次代表大会证明，我们的党一直坚持不渝地奉行列宁的久经考验的方针——巩固工农联盟是走向社会主义建设胜利的唯一的道路。
    代表大会证明，我们的党如何巩固了它的队伍，它的党员如何在建设社会主义的艰苦斗争中、在反对阶级敌人和帝国主义代理人的斗争中增长了，坚强了并受到了锻炼。
    第二次代表大会出色地表现了无产阶级国际主义，表现了我们和资本主义国家劳动群众的联系和团结，表现了我们和其他人民民主国家的兄弟合作和我们对伟大的苏联——全体进步人类争取和平、进步和民主的斗争的堡垒——越来越深的、牢固的友谊和忠诚。
    第二次代表大会总结了我们在执行六年计划中所做的工作和所取得的成就，并且制订了今后几年的明确的工作纲领。代表大会着重地指出了发展农业和迅速地提高人民生活水平的绝对必要。
    第二次代表大会毫无疑问地对解决我们社会主义建设的基本问题——发展和巩固工农联盟——有了创造性的贡献。
    第二次代表大会证明，批评和自我批评是党改善工作、纠正错误和偏差、扩大与劳动群众和广大人民的联系的一个有力的武器。第二次代表大会证明，波兰统一工人党是人民的先锋队，是在为提高人民的力量和福利而努力。
    第二次代表大会比以前更明显地表明了为我们整个发展过程所证实的不容争辩的事实，即全体劳动人民的进步和幸福、整个国家的进步和幸福都有赖于我们党的力量和团结。党在争取解放的斗争中领导了人民，党在恢复为战争所破坏的国家时，领导了人民。党在波兰工业化的伟大任务中，成为了鼓舞的力量。今天，党动员全体人民来执行迅速发展农业、迅速提高生活水平、胜利地完成伟大的六年计划的伟大任务。
    党继承波兰人民最优秀的进步传统，成了全国阵线的骨干和主要力量，它和人民取得紧密的联系，领导一切劳动人民的团体——国家的机构和公众的团体。整个党必须根据对这一点的认识来进行工作，我们党新选举出来的中央委员会将根据这一点来重新调配我们的力量，执行代表大会所规定的任务。
    我们将遵循第二次代表大会所规定的道路，继续巩固工农联盟，不倦地提高我们的农业生产和劳动人民的生活和文化水平，我们将不倦地提高我们人民国家的经济和国防力量。
    我们要帮助千百万群众、党员和非党人民更深刻地了解我们党在人民波兰的新生活建设中的任务！
    我们要使人民了解团结着我们人民、照耀着我们整个生活以及党用来照亮引导我们国家走向进步和繁荣的道路的伟大思想的巨大意义。
    第二次代表大会通过的党章就表明了这种思想。
    我们要经常努力在各方面巩固我们和苏联的联盟。我们要经常努力从各方面巩固我们和为全人类指引道路的英雄的苏联共产党的兄弟般的战斗联系。
    波兰人民的领导者、波兰统一工人党万岁！
    我们党的集体领导机构、中央委员会万岁！
    波兰人民共和国万岁！
    波兰人民万岁！
    向新的胜利前进！
    向社会主义前进！（新华社据塔斯社华沙讯）
