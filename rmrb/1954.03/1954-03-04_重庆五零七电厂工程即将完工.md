The Chongqing 507 Power Plant project, one of the 141 enterprises being built with Soviet assistance to China, is entering its final stage. Since construction began on the 507 Plant over a year ago, more than fifty major civil engineering projects have been successfully completed, and the installation work is nearing its end. Currently, some of the mechanical equipment has begun trial operation for final inspection and testing. To ensure the successful completion of the final work, a temporary start-up acceptance committee has been established at the construction site. On February 17, the coal conveying system, an important component of the power plant, officially began trial operation. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the operating workers started the conveyor belt and sent coal for the first time to the main plant building, which is several tens of meters high. On the 19th, a certain boiler also began to increase pressure and send steam to flush the pipes. After more than a day of intense preparation, a strong stream of steam was successfully sent out at just after 2 p.m. that day. Other coal pulverizers, coal feeders, and exhaust fans have also been started up one after another. So far, the general trial operation has been normal.

Some unfinished installation projects are proceeding intensely. In order to strive for early power generation, the workers have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. The main mechanical equipment of the power plant, the steam turbine, has begun to have its second layer of cement poured on its base, after workers corrected it all night and Soviet experts inspected it. The workers installing a certain boiler voluntarily gave up their Spring Festival holiday in order to allow the boiler to send out steam as soon as possible; Soviet experts also came to the construction site to provide guidance during the Spring Festival, and some experts even personally helped with the welding. Thanks to the workers’ creative and proactive efforts, the inner shell of the water pump room, which is crucial to whether the power plant can generate electricity, was completed five days ahead of schedule. In the construction of this project, the use of movable wooden molds for pouring concrete not only saved a large amount of wood but also greatly shortened the construction period, allowing the installation work to begin twenty-five days earlier. Currently, the machine installation work in the water pump room is being carried out in three shifts. Crane operators also completed the hoisting of hundreds of tons of huge machinery ahead of schedule.

Simultaneous with the intense construction and trial operation, the 507 Plant is actively carrying out production preparations. The operating personnel who were sent to the Northeast and Zhengzhou for training last year have returned. The four short-term training courses for operating personnel in boilers, turbines, and chemical analysis, which were run by the plant itself, have also been completed. They are now all undergoing practical training in the new plant buildings, preparing to welcome formal production.

    重庆五零七电厂工程即将完工
    苏联帮助我国建设的一四一项企业之一——重庆五零七电厂工程已进入结尾阶段。五零七厂兴工一年多来，五十多项重大的土建工程已胜利完工，安装工作即将结束。目前，部分机械设备已开始进行试运转，作最后的检查、试验。为保证结尾工作胜利完成，工地成立了临时启动验收委员会。二月十七日，电厂的重要组成部分——输煤系统正式开始试运转。在苏联专家指导下，运转工人开动了运输带，第一次把煤送到了几十公尺高的主厂房里。十九日，某号锅炉也开始升压并送蒸汽冲洗管道，经过一天多的紧张准备，在当天下午两点多钟，顺利地送出了强烈的蒸汽。其他磨煤机、喂煤机、排粉机等也都先后进行了启动。到目前为止，一般试运转情况都很正常。
    部分未安装完的工程正紧张地进行着。为了争取早日发电，工人们发挥了高度的劳动热忱。电厂的主要机械设备汽轮机，经工人们连夜的校正和苏联专家的检查后，已开始在机座上浇灌第二次水泥。安装某号锅炉的工人们，为使锅炉能早日送出蒸汽，自动放弃春节休假；苏联专家们在春节中也照样来到工地指导，有的专家还亲自动手帮着电焊。关系电厂能否发电的水泵房，在工人们创造性的积极努力下，内壳工程已提前五天完工。在此项工程施工中，采用活动木模浇灌混凝土，不仅节约了大批木料，而且大大缩短了工期，使安装工程提前二十五天进行。目前水泵房的机器安装工作正分三班进行。起重工们也提前完成了成百吨庞大机械的吊装任务。
    与紧张施工、试运转的同时，五零七厂正积极进行生产准备工作。去年先后送往东北、郑州学习的运转人员已经回来了，本厂开办的锅炉、透平、化验等四个运转人员短期训练班，也已结业，现在都在新的厂房里进行实习，准备迎接正式生产。
