Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesperson of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 22nd regarding the release of wounded enemy soldiers captured by the Vietnam People's Army at Dien Bien Phu. The statement said:

　　1. After the Vietnam People's Army completely annihilated the 3rd Battalion of the 13th Foreign Legion Brigade and the 5th Battalion of the 7th Foreign Legion Regiment at enemy strongholds surrounding Dien Bien Phu during the attacks on March 13th and 14th, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, following the instructions of President Ho Chi Minh, released seventy-eight wounded enemy prisoners of war.

　　However, the General Headquarters of the French Far East Expeditionary Force has treated this humanitarian act with an unwarranted attitude, which proves that the French military headquarters has shown that it does not value the lives of its wounded soldiers.

　　2. In the days from March 15th to 19th, although the French military headquarters was clearly aware of the location of the Vietnam People's Army hospital area, it continued to use American bombers and fighter planes with napalm bombs to bomb our military hospitals from time to time.

　　3. Since March 15th, the French military headquarters has been using Dakota transport planes, under the guise of the Red Cross emblem, to transport ammunition for 105mm howitzers and 120mm mortars to the Dien Bien Phu airfield. Enemy artillery in the trenches constantly bombarded locations they believed to be Vietnam People's Army positions, and these planes attempted to land and unload during the bombardment.

　　We are making public the truth about the wounded French soldiers at Dien Bien Phu to French and world public opinion so that everyone will not be deceived by the malicious slanders spread by the French military headquarters and certain elements of the French colonialist group.

    越南人民军总部发言人就释放奠边府被俘敌军伤兵一事发表声明
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国人民军总司令部发言人二十二日就释放越南人民军在奠边府俘虏的敌军伤兵事发表声明。声明说：
    一、越南人民军在三月十三日和十四日进攻奠边府周围敌军据点全歼外籍军团第十三旅第三营和外籍军团第七团第五营以后，越南人民军总司令部遵照胡志明主席的指令，释放了七十八个受伤的敌军俘虏。
    然而，远东法国远征军总司令部以不应有的态度来对待这种人道的行动，这种态度证明，法军总司令部已表示它是不重视它的伤兵的生命的。
    二、在三月十五日到十九日的几天中，虽然法军总司令部很清楚地知道越南人民军的医院区的所在，但是它仍不时以美国轰炸机和战斗机用凝固汽油弹来轰炸我们的军事医院。
    三、从三月十五日以来，法军总司令部假借红十字的标志，利用达科他式运输机把一零五公厘口径大炮和一二零公厘口径迫击炮所用的弹药运到奠边府机场。战壕中的敌军大炮不断向他们以为是越南人民军阵地的地点轰击，这些飞机就企图在轰击时着陆和卸货。
    我们将奠边府法军受伤士兵事件的真相向法国和世界舆论公布，以便大家不致被法军总司令部和法国殖民者集团的某些分子所散布的恶毒谰言所欺骗。
