Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st dispatch from TASS: The Thirteenth Plenary Session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions was held on the 18th and 19th in the Column Hall of the House of Unions in Moscow.

    Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the meeting on the tasks of the trade unions in implementing the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Developing Virgin and Fallow Lands." In his report, he pointed out that since the Party Central Committee held its plenary session last September, Soviet trade unions have done much work in mobilizing workers and staff to implement the instructions of the Party and government on further developing agriculture. A socialist competition is underway in industry to complete the government's tasks of manufacturing agricultural machinery and other parts ahead of schedule. Currently, Soviet trade unions must guide the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, engineers, and office staff to implement the tasks stipulated in the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Developing Virgin and Fallow Lands." It is necessary to organizationally strengthen the work of trade union organizations in machine tractor stations and state farms. Shvernik then spoke in detail about the construction of housing and cultural and social service facilities for workers, agricultural experts, and staff in machine tractor stations and state farms. He said that from 1954 to 1956, 10,800 houses and 3,000 apartments will be built in machine tractor stations. 450 million rubles will be allocated annually to help private housing construction. This year, it is planned to build houses with a construction area of approximately 400,000 square meters in state farms. The government has also allocated 148 million rubles to build cultural and social service facilities.

    After Shvernik's report, the plenary session held a heated discussion on the report.

    The plenary session finally passed a resolution specifying the concrete tasks of trade union organizations in implementing the resolutions of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏工会中央理事会于十八、十九两日在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了第十三次全体会议。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席什维尔尼克，在会上作了工会在执行苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的决议的任务的报告。他在报告中指出：苏联工会自从党中央去年九月举行全体会议以来，在动员职工执行党和政府的进一步发展农业的指示方面已作了许多的工作。工业中正在展开提前完成政府关于制造农业机器和其他零件的任务的社会主义竞赛。目前苏联工会必须引导工人、工程师和机关工作人员的积极性和创造性，来执行党中央委员会全体会议“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的决议中所规定的任务。必须在组织上加强机器拖拉机站和国营农场工会组织的工作。什维尔尼克接着详细地谈到了为机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人、农业专家和工作人员建筑住宅和文化与社会服务机关的问题。他说：在从一九五四年到一九五六年这段时期中，将在机器拖拉机站建筑一万零八百幢住宅和三千个公寓。每年将拨四亿五千万卢布来帮助私人建筑住宅。今年计划在国营农场建造建筑面积约为四十万平方公尺的房屋。政府并已拨出了一亿四千八百万卢布来建筑文化和社会服务机关。
    什维尔尼克报告以后，全体会议就对这一报告展开了热烈的讨论。
    全体会议最后通过了一项决议，规定了工会组织在执行苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议中的具体任务。
