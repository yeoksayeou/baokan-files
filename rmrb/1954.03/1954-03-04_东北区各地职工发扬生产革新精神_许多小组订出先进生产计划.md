    Under the radiant light of the General Line, workers in Northeast China are actively learning from the pioneering actions of Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and Wei Yuxi, combining production innovation with the completion of national plans, and formulating production plans to ensure the overfulfillment of national plans. The Han Shuwen team in the casting workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory formulated an advanced plan to complete one year and six and a half months' worth of production quotas in one year; the Zhao Zhonglu team in the first workshop of the Harbin Tool Factory formulated a fighting plan to complete the first quarter's national plan thirty-seven days ahead of schedule; Zhang Benlian, a lathe operator at the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory, aimed to complete the first quarter's national plan thirty days ahead of schedule; the Wang Baohua team at the locally state-owned Shenyang Cotton Weaving Factory prepared to complete the first quarter's plan five days ahead of schedule; the Wang Kelin team at the Nonferrous Metal Processing Factory and the Joint Third Team of the Third Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory also formulated advanced plans.
    The advanced plans of various units were proposed on the ideological basis of workers' improved socialist consciousness after receiving education on the General Line. When formulating advanced production plans, workers in various places regarded the promotion of decisive advanced experience as the main method for completing national plans ahead of schedule. In the process of formulating the plan, the Zhao Zhonglu team learned and promoted four advanced experiences, such as "non-rocking indexing plate," "electric spark strengthening knife," and "Wei Yuxi's shortening of auxiliary working hours," which greatly shortened working hours. In the discussion of the plan, the Han Shuwen team found that the core-making workers could not keep up with the progress of the molding workers, so the molding workers helped the core-making workers to study and improve their skills. The core-making workers also successfully developed a card wire machine and a straight wire machine, which improved the efficiency of core-making and made the work efficiency of the core-making workers compatible with that of the molding workers. Hou Zhanshan, an old worker of the Joint Third Team of the Third Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, and the workshop technician studied and improved the operation method, which solved the problem of low processing quality of certain parts. The old worker Fu Fengxiang successfully developed a round tool holder fixture and then proposed a method to improve sharpening, which increased the machine tool utilization rate. The Wang Kelin team of the Nonferrous Metal Processing Factory found the trick of adding salt and charcoal powder to molten steel, which improved the metal quality and recovery rate.
    In order to ensure the realization of advanced plans, many units have formulated measures plans, included the advanced experiences to be learned and promoted in the measures plans, and made specific provisions on quality assurance, machine maintenance, and attendance rates.

### 东北区各地职工发扬生产革新精神  许多小组订出先进生产计划

    东北区各地职工发扬生产革新精神
    许多小组订出先进生产计划
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，东北各地职工积极学习张明山、王崇伦、韦玉玺的首创行为，把生产革新和完成国家计划结合起来，纷纷订出保证超额完成国家计划的生产计划。沈阳水泵厂铸工车间韩述文小组订出一年完成一年零六个半月生产定额的先进计划；哈尔滨工具厂第一车间赵忠禄小组订出提前三十七天完成第一季度国家计划的奋斗计划；哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂车工张本连要提前三十天完成第一季度国家计划；地方国营沈阳棉织厂王宝华小组准备提前五天完成第一季度计划；有色金属加工厂王克林小组、沈阳第三机床厂三车间联合三组等也都订出了先进计划。
    各单位的先进计划是在工人们经过总路线教育，提高了社会主义自觉性的思想基础上提出的。在制订先进生产计划时，各地工人都以推广决定性的先进经验作为他们提前完成国家计划的主要方法。赵忠禄小组在制订计划的过程中，学习与推广了“不摇分盘”“电火花强化刀”“韦玉玺缩短辅助工时”等四种先进经验，使工时大大缩短。韩述文小组在讨论计划中发现打芯工人跟不上铸型的进度，铸型工人便帮助打芯工人研究改进了技术，打芯工人自己也研究成功了卡铁丝机和直铁丝机，提高了打芯子的效率，使打芯工的工作效率和铸型工相适应。沈阳第三机床厂三车间联合三组老工人侯占山和车间技术员研究改进了操作方法，解决了某种部件加工质量低的问题；老工人傅凤祥研究成功了圆刀架治具，接着又提出改进磨刀的办法，提高了机床开动率。有色金属加工厂王克林小组找出熔钢加食盐和木炭粉的窍门，提高了金属质量和实收率。
    为了保证先进计划的实现，许多单位订出了措施计划，把决定要学习和推广的先进经验订到措施计划中去，另外对保证质量、机器保养和出勤率等都作了具体规定。
