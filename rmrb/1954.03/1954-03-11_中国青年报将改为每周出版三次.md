    China Youth Daily to be Published Three Times a Week
    According to instructions from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, China Youth Daily has decided to change its publication frequency from twice a week to three times a week (published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) starting April 1 this year. After changing the publication schedule, China Youth Daily will further improve its content, strengthen its connection with reality, enhance its guidance for the youth movement and its socialist ideological education for the broad masses of young people, and increase the number of articles on literature, art, sports, scientific knowledge, and illustrations in accordance with the characteristics of youth.
    China Youth Daily was founded on April 27, 1951. Based on the situation at that time and the Youth League's work, the Central Committee of the Youth League decided that the newspaper would be temporarily published twice a week. At present, the country has entered a period of planned economic construction, and the development of various national construction works and Youth League work requires the newspaper to more rapidly reflect the progress of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, strengthen socialist ideological education and cultural and scientific knowledge education for young people, and at the same time more rapidly guide the national youth movement, timely convey the decisions of leading organs, and disseminate grassroots work experience. Publishing twice a week can no longer meet the needs of the Youth League's work and satisfy the growing demands of the broad masses of young people for learning cultural knowledge, so it is being changed to publishing three times a week.

    中国青年报将改为每周出版三次
    中国青年报根据中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会指示，决定自今年四月一日起，由每周出版二次改为每周出版三次（每逢星期二、四、六出版）。改变刊期后的中国青年报，将进一步改善报纸内容，加强与实际的联系，增强对青年运动的指导性和对广大青年的社会主义的思想教育，并按照青年特点，增加文艺、体育、科学知识、图画等篇幅。
    中国青年报是一九五一年四月二十七日创刊的。根据当时的形势和青年团工作状况，青年团中央确定该报暂时每周出版二次。目前国家已经进入有计划的经济建设时期，国家各项建设工作和青年团工作的发展，要求报纸更迅速地反映国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的进展面貌，加强对青年的社会主义的思想教育和文化科学知识的教育，同时更迅速地指导全国青年运动，及时地传达领导机关的决议，传播基层工作经验。每周出版二次，已不能符合青年团工作的需要和满足广大青年对学习文化知识的日益增长的要求，因此改为每周出版三次。
