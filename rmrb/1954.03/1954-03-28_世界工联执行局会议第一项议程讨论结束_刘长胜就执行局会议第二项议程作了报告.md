Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 25th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting continued on the 25th. After the discussion of the first item on the agenda, WFTU General Secretary Louis Saillant made a concluding speech.

He pointed out that the speeches made by the members of the Executive Bureau when discussing his report enabled them to understand the successful implementation of the resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress and the increasingly active struggle of the working people of all countries to achieve various economic and social demands.

Saillant emphasized that the struggle of the working people of Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia to achieve economic and social demands has been, and is now, inextricably linked with the struggle against the power politics of American monopoly capital, against the arms race, and for national independence and the establishment of lasting and solid peace.

Saillant said that it is necessary to mobilize the broadest masses of working people to unite in action against the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. The WFTU should establish closer ties with the West German working class to support their struggle against the rearmament of West Germany.

Saillant called for strengthening united action with working people who have not yet joined the WFTU, and exposing the anti-working class policies of the leaders of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," the "International Federation of Christian Trade Unions," the American Federation of Labor, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

Finally, WFTU Secretary Liu Changsheng gave a report on "The Struggle to Achieve Recognition and Implementation of the Basic Principles of Defending Trade Union Rights and the Preparations for the 1954 'May Day' International Labor Day."

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 26th: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Executive Bureau meeting on the 25th heard a report by WFTU Secretary Liu Changsheng on "The Struggle to Achieve Recognition and Implementation of the Basic Principles of Defending Trade Union Rights and the Preparations for the 1954 'May Day' International Labor Day."

Liu Changsheng said that the resolution of the Third World Trade Union Congress greatly emphasized the struggle of working people and trade unions for the winning and defense of trade union rights and democratic freedoms. The Congress particularly pointed out that, in the face of increasingly rampant attacks by monopoly capital and governments in capitalist countries on trade unions and social laws formulated after the tenacious struggles of working people, the slogan for celebrating the 1954 "May Day" must be to defend and strive for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

Liu Changsheng said that reactionary forces are gradually dragging capitalist countries onto the path of fascism and infringing upon the legitimate rights and freedoms of working people. A series of laws enacted by the U.S. government have greatly infringed upon the economic and social rights of workers. Political and other persecutions of progressive trade unionists are very rampant. Hundreds of foreign-born trade unionists have been expelled from the United States under the McCarran Act for participating in anti-unemployment strikes. Anyone who opposes Senator McCarthy's fascist "activities" is being dismissed. The head of the Paris Chamber of Commerce is demanding that the government enact laws prohibiting political strikes. The director of the Fiat factory in Italy has demanded the dismissal of five hundred workers for the sole reason that they are communists and socialists. In Britain, discrimination against trade union activists who participate in strikes has also become more common. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, democratic freedoms and trade union rights are being brutally violated.

Liu Changsheng went on to say that the working people are answering the attacks, terror, and infringements on democratic freedoms and trade union rights by the reactionaries with heroic struggles for better lives, for national independence, and for peace and bread. The activities of workers and trade union organizations have strengthened, and the unified actions of workers to fight for their rights have also strengthened.

Liu Changsheng emphasized that the WFTU is providing concrete assistance to the struggles of working people through various trade union internationals and national trade union centers, encouraging them to take more resolute and unified actions to defend and strive for trade union rights and democratic freedoms. Liu Changsheng suggested developing the closest possible cooperation with legal professionals on an international and national scale to oppose infringements on the trade union rights of working people. On behalf of the WFTU Secretariat, he proposed the establishment of a committee to draft a charter of trade union rights for working people, which, after extensive discussion by WFTU members and trade union members who have not yet joined the WFTU, would be submitted to the next meeting of the WFTU Council for approval.

The first to speak during the discussion of Liu Changsheng's report was Baumgart, General Secretary of the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone Workers' International. He described the violations of trade union rights and democratic freedoms in capitalist and colonial countries.

L.N. Soloviev, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, then spoke. He emphasized that the attempt by the reactionaries to deprive the working class of one of the basic means of defending their interests, the right to strike, is a serious threat to the trade union rights and democratic freedoms of working people. Therefore, special attention should be paid to protecting the right to strike.

WFTU Vice-Presidents Toledano and Saling also spoke in the discussion.

    世界工联执行局会议第一项议程讨论结束
    刘长胜就执行局会议第二项议程作了报告
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十五日讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议二十五日继续进行。世界工联总书记路易·赛扬在第一项议程讨论结束后，作了总结发言。
    他指出，大家在讨论他的报告时所作的发言，使执行局的委员们了解到世界工会第三次代表大会的决议胜利执行的情况，以及各国劳动人民日益积极地为达到经济与社会的各种要求而进行斗争的情况。
    赛扬强调说：欧洲、美洲、非洲、亚洲的劳动人民为达到经济与社会要求的斗争，过去和现在都是和反对美国垄断资本的实力政策、反对军备竞赛、争取民族独立及建立持久和巩固和平的斗争不可分割地联系着的。
    赛扬说：必须动员最广泛的劳动人民统一行动起来，反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。世界工联应当与西德工人阶级建立更紧密的联系，支援他们反对重新武装西德的斗争。
    赛扬号召加强与还没有参加世界工联的劳动人民一致行动，揭露“国际自由工会联合会”、“国际基督教工会联合会”、美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会的头子们的反对工人阶级的政策。
    最后，世界工联书记刘长胜做了关于“争取承认和履行保卫工会权利的基本原则的斗争和一九五四年‘五一’国际劳动节的筹备工作”的报告。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十六日讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议二十五日听取了世界工联书记刘长胜关于“争取承认和履行保卫工会权利的基本原则的斗争和一九五四年‘五一’国际劳动节的筹备工作”的报告。
    刘长胜说：世界工会第三次代表大会的决议十分强调劳动人民和工会为争取和保卫工会权利和民主自由而进行的斗争。大会特别指出，在资本主义国家的垄断资本和政府对工会和经过劳动人民的顽强斗争后制定的社会法律的进攻日益猖狂的情况下，庆祝一九五四年“五一”节的口号必须是保卫和争取工会权利和民主自由。
    刘长胜说，反动势力正把资本主义国家日渐拖上法西斯主义和侵犯劳动人民的合法权利与自由的道路。美国政府制定的一连串的法律大大侵犯了职工们的经济与社会权利。对进步工会工作者的政治和其他迫害行动非常猖獗。数百位在外国出生的工会工作者因为参加了反失业的罢工而被根据麦卡伦法逐出了美国。凡是反对参议员麦卡锡的法西斯
  “活动”的人们都在被解雇。巴黎商会的负责人正在要求政府颁布禁止政治罢工的法律。意大利的菲亚特工厂厂长已经要求解雇五百名工人，唯一的理由是他们是共产党员和社会党员。在英国，歧视参加罢工的工会活动分子的事情也更为常见了。在殖民地和半殖民地国家中，民主自由和工会权利正受到残酷的侵犯。
    刘长胜接着说，劳动人民为改善生活、为民族独立、为和平和面包而进行英勇的斗争，来回答反动派的进攻、恐怖和侵犯民主自由与工会权利的活动。工人和工会组织的活动加强了，工人们为争取自身权利的一致行动也加强了。
    刘长胜强调指出，世界工联正通过各工会国际和各国工会中心对劳动人民的斗争给予具体的帮助，鼓舞他们采取更坚决、更一致的行动来保卫并争取工会权利和民主自由。刘长胜建议在国际和全国的规模上发展与法律工作者之间的尽可能密切的合作，来反对侵犯劳动人民的工会权利。他代表世界工联书记处建议成立一个委员会来起草劳动人民工会权利章程，经过世界工联和还未加入世界工联的工会会员广泛讨论以后，交世界工联理事会下届会议批准。
    在讨论刘长胜的报告时首先发言的是邮电工人工会国际总书记鲍姆加特。他叙述了资本主义和殖民地国家中工会权利和民主自由受到侵犯的情况。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记列·尼·索洛维耶夫接着发言。他强调指出，反动派想剥夺工人阶级的保卫他们利益的基本手段之一的罢工权的企图，是对劳动人民工会权利和民主自由的严重威胁。因此，应该特别注意保卫罢工权。
    在讨论中发言的还有世界工联副主席托列达诺和萨林。
