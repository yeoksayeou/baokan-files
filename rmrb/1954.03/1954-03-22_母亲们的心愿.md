　　Mothers' Wishes

　　It was the morning of March 18th. A fierce wind whipped up dust and sand across the land, and the sky was covered with light gray clouds, causing a sudden drop in temperature. However, inside the Zhongshan Hall in Beijing's Zhongshan Park, a warm current still prevailed. Here, over four hundred family members of fallen and serving soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Beijing met with thirteen representatives of the visiting delegation from the People's Republic of Korea. Among them, many had husbands and children who had shed blood or even given their lives in the struggle against a common enemy. Today, separated by thousands of miles, they gathered together, how could they not be moved?

　　It was truly an unforgettable moment! Look: Auntie Tian, a fifty-eight-year-old woman with graying hair, received a bouquet of flowers from Gu Fuli, a member of the Korean People's Visiting Delegation and a "Model of Support for the Front," and the two embraced. Another one approached. This was Auntie Ban, a people's representative and model military family member from Chongwen District. Gu Fuli also embraced her. Two, three... they all came forward, Gu Fuli embracing each one. These glorious mothers embraced each other, smiling, tears of excitement and emotion streaming down their faces. Tears fell on the milky white collar of the Korean mother and on the excited face of the Chinese mother. They lifted Gu Fuli up, carrying her from the right corner of the stage all the way to the stage, as waves of applause and beautiful music echoed throughout the hall.

　　In the lounge, a dozen or so representatives of the families of fallen and serving soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers chatted with the Korean comrades. Gu Fuli told the Chinese mothers about her experiences supporting the front lines. She said, "Originally, there were eight people in my family: my husband, Jin Fuhuan, four boys, two girls, and myself. In 1951, three of my boys were killed by enemy bombs. Last year, during the counterattack south of Jin City in July, my husband also sacrificed himself to protect wounded Volunteer soldiers. My husband's sacrifice naturally brought me sorrow, but it also gave me greater strength to support the front lines and eliminate the enemy. My surviving son, Jin Jilong, and I replaced my husband in carrying stretchers. After the war, I organized the women of the entire village to work hard in production and participate in post-war reconstruction. When I heard that I was coming to China this time, I felt truly fortunate. I so wanted to see the Chinese mothers who raised and educated the heroic Volunteers! Now I've seen them!" Gu Fuli's words touched the hearts of every Chinese mother, and tears welled up in their eyes again. Bai Yuzhen, a model military family member from Beijing, took a slice of orange from the coffee table, peeled it, and offered it to Gu Fuli's mouth, wiping away her tears as she said, "We've long heard, long heard of the heroic Korean people's support for our husbands and children. My husband is still in Korea, and I'm going to write to him and tell him to guard his position well and be on guard against the enemy!" Gu Fuli smiled. She held Bai Yuzhen's hand tightly and said, "We Korean women will never forget October 25th. On that day, we Korean people all write letters of慰问to the Volunteers. After I return to my country, I will immediately write to your husband and say: I saw your wife, Bai Yuzhen, in China!" Gu Fuli's sincere and kind words brought a burst of joyful laughter from the Chinese mothers.

　　At this time, Peng Bilin and Cui Zhen also began to talk. This thirty-seven-year-old mother had sent all three of her children to join the army. Her daughter, Zhao Qi, even earned a third-class merit award during the counterattack south of Jin City last year. She herself was a midwife, and she had put so much effort into the happiness of mothers and children! She had delivered more than three hundred babies without a single death. She held Cui Zhen's hand tightly, leaned close to him, and personally placed a slice of orange into Cui Zhen's mouth, saying, "Eat, child. I know Korean mothers treat my children the same way!"

　　It was time to say goodbye, and everyone was so reluctant to part! Hou Yanping hugged Cui Zhen tightly. Her second son, Li Tianji, sacrificed himself on the Korean front on June 9, 1952. Now, holding a child from the land where her son gave his life, she said with tears in her eyes, "You finally got to see a Chinese mother, and I finally got to see a Korean child."

  　母亲们的心愿
    这是三月十八日的上午。狂风吹卷着大地上的尘沙，天空罩上了淡灰色的云层，温度突然下降。但是，在北京中山公园的中山堂里，依然洋溢着一股暖流。这里，北京市的四百多个志愿军的烈、军属和朝鲜人民访华代表团的十三位代表见面了。在他们中间，很多人的丈夫和儿女曾在反抗共同敌人的斗争中流过鲜血甚至献出了生命，今天，远隔千山万水的他们欢聚在一堂了，怎能不激动呢？
    真是令人难忘的时刻！看吧：田大妈，一位五十八岁头发斑白的老人，双手接过来朝鲜人民访华代表团团员、“支前模范”具富力献给她的一束鲜花，两个人就拥抱起来了。又一个，走过来了。这是崇文区的人民代表、模范军属班大娘。具富力也把她拥抱起来了。两个、三个……，都走过来了，具富力一个一个拥抱着。这些光荣的母亲们相互拥抱着，笑着，激动、兴奋的热泪从她们的眼里淌了下来。泪水，落在朝鲜母亲乳白色的衣襟上，落在中国母亲激动的面庞上。她们把具富力抬起来了，从主席台的右角一直抬到主席台上，一阵阵的掌声和悠美的音乐在整个大厅里回荡着。
    在休息室里，十几位志愿军的烈、军属代表和朝鲜同志们畅谈起来了。具富力给中国母亲们介绍了自己支援前线的情况。她说：“我原来家中共八口人：丈夫金福焕、四个男孩两个女孩和我。一九五一年，三个男孩都叫敌人的炸弹炸死了。在去年七月金城以南的反击战中，丈夫为了掩护志愿军伤员，也牺牲了。丈夫的牺牲，自然给我带来了悲痛，但也给我带来了更大的力量去支援前线，消灭敌人，我和活着的男孩子金基龙代替我的丈夫抬担架了。战争结束后，我就组织全里妇女努力生产，参加战后恢复工作。这次听说要到中国来，我真觉得幸运，我是多么想看看抚养了和教育了英雄的志愿军的中国母亲啊！现在可看到了！”具富力的话，感动着每一个中国母亲的心，她们眼里又淌出了泪花。北京市军属模范白玉贞，从茶几上拿过来一瓣切开了的橘子，送到了具富力的嘴里，擦干了眼泪说：“早就听到了，早就听到了英雄的朝鲜人民对我们丈夫和儿女的支援。我的爱人还在朝鲜，我要写信给他，叫他好好守卫住阵地，防备着敌人！”具富力笑了。她紧紧握住白玉贞的手说：“我们朝鲜妇女永远忘不了十月二十五日的日子。在那一天，我们朝鲜人民都要给志愿军写慰问信。回国后，我马上给你的爱人写信，就说：我在中国看到你的爱人白玉贞了！”具富力这几句诚恳亲切的话，引起了中国母亲们一阵愉快的笑声。
    这时，彭碧林和崔?也谈起来了。这位三十七岁的母亲，把三个儿女都送去参军了。女儿赵奇，在去年金城以南反击战中，还立过一次三等功。她自己是助产士，为了母亲和孩子的幸福，她曾付出了多少心血啊！她曾为三百多个母亲接过生，没有一个死亡。她紧紧握着崔?的手，挨着他的身子，把一瓣橘子亲手递到崔?的嘴里，说：“吃吧，孩子。我知道朝鲜的母亲也是这样对待我的孩子的！”
    要分别了，大家是多么依依不舍啊！侯彦平把崔?紧紧拥抱起来了。她的二儿子李天骥，一九五二年六月九日在朝鲜前线牺牲了。现在他抱着从他儿子献出生命的土地上来的孩子，眼里含着激动的泪水说：“你总算看到了中国的妈妈，我也总算看到了朝鲜的孩子。”
