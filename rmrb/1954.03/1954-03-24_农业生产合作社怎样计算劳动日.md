How Agricultural Production Cooperatives Calculate Labor Days
    Shi Linqi
    In agricultural production cooperatives, a certain amount of remuneration according to labor must be implemented. However, in labor production, there is a big difference between diligence and laziness, tightness and looseness. What should be done? It is said that it is calculated according to "labor days", but what if the quality of labor is different every day? If you work well and do more, one day is counted as one "labor day", if you work badly and do less, one day is counted as one "labor day", then who is willing to work harder and more attentively?
    This is indeed a very important issue in running a cooperative. If this problem is not solved well, it will hinder the production of the cooperative and affect the income of the members. For the members, some will suffer losses and some will benefit; for the whole cooperative, the overall result will be that everyone suffers losses. Therefore, the work of calculating labor days (generally called "recording work") must be done well.
    Two Calculation Methods Can Be Adopted
    According to the experience of some agricultural production cooperatives that have been successfully run in the past, there are roughly two methods for calculating labor days:
    One calculation method is "fixed score, flexible evaluation", which is: according to the strength of labor and the level of technology, evaluate the "base score" of each person; then, according to each person's actual labor situation, add points for good performance and deduct points for poor performance. If the difference is not big, the original "base score" will still be used for work recording, and every ten points will be counted as one labor day. For example, some people have good technology and strong labor, and the "base score" is rated as ten points. However, if he is not active in his work, and does it roughly or slowly, then, when recording labor days (generally called "recording work"), points should be deducted; if he does it particularly well, particularly quickly, and is significantly better than others, then, when recording labor days, points should be added; if two points are added every day for five days, then, if he works for five days, it will be counted as six labor days. Some people's "base score" is only rated as seven points based on their labor strength and general agricultural work skills. But he has certain expertise, for example, he specializes in weeding, and weeds better and faster than others, then when weeding, points should be added to him according to his actual weeding situation.
    Another calculation method is "piecework", which is to determine the quality standards (good or bad) of various agricultural tasks according to the difficulty, weight, technical work and general work of agricultural tasks, as well as the different seasons of busy and slack farming, and then take the amount (how much) that a medium labor force can complete in one day as the standard, as one labor day. Those who meet this standard will be recorded as one labor day, those who exceed the standard will increase, and those who do not meet the standard will decrease. For example: weeding, how fine and uniform it should be; according to this quality standard, a medium labor force can weed three mu in one day, then "weeding three mu, how fine and uniform" is the standard for calculating labor days for weeding. If the quality of weeding meets the standard of fineness and uniformity, and the quantity exceeds it, for example, four and a half mu are weeded, then one and a half labor days should be recorded. If only one mu or one and a half mu are weeded, then only one-third or one-half of a labor day will be recorded. However, there are also some agricultural tasks that are not allowed to exceed the quantity standard, for example, it is stipulated that two mules are used to plow six and a half mu of land a day, plowing six inches deep, and harrowing once, and the ground is level, then one labor day will be recorded; if the standard is not met, less will be recorded, but it cannot be exceeded. This is because it is necessary to protect the livestock and prevent it from being too tired.
    The former method is relatively simple and easy to handle, but it is not reasonable enough. It is not easy to accurately determine the "base score", and there is no certain standard in the "flexible evaluation". It is relatively difficult to evaluate, and can only achieve general fairness. The second method is relatively reasonable, but the calculation is quite complicated. Under the current conditions, there is little experience and the agricultural work is miscellaneous, and it is still difficult to accurately calculate everything. Therefore, most agricultural production cooperatives now adopt both methods at the same time. All those that are easy to calculate quantity and quality standards, or easy to calculate the amount of individual labor (such as: carrying manure, how many loads; picking cotton, how many catties, etc.), can be calculated by piecework; some that are not easy to calculate, or that require several people to do at the same time, and it is impossible to calculate the amount of work done by each person, can only adopt the method of "group contracting and individual flexible evaluation" to evaluate each person's labor days. For example, although it can be stipulated that weeding how much and what kind counts as one labor day, it is not possible for one person to weed a piece of land, but several people must weed in a piece of land at the same time, then it is determined how many labor days are needed in total to weed this piece of land, and contracted to these people; after completion, they can mutually evaluate the labor days of each person.
    Should Be Suitable for Various Specific Conditions
    Calculating the labor days of members is a complicated task. Because the labor force of agricultural production cooperatives is large, with strengths and weaknesses, different levels of technology, and different expertise, some specialize in plowing, some specialize in sowing, some specialize in weeding, some specialize in feeding livestock, etc.; at the same time, there are many and miscellaneous tasks in the cooperative, including agriculture and sideline occupations, as well as different levels of lightness, heaviness, skill, clumsiness, roughness, fineness, busy, and slack. With so many different people and so many different things, it is necessary to calculate accurately and precisely in order to be fair and reasonable. However, according to the current conditions of agricultural production cooperatives, it is not possible to completely and accurately calculate everything all at once. It can only be improved step by step with the development of production and the increase of experience.
    When implementing the method of "fixed score, flexible evaluation", attention should be paid not to "deduct" too rigidly, and not to argue every bit, as long as it is generally fair and there is not much objection from each other; but it should not be too careless, and mutual evaluation should also be carried out according to the actual situation of the work, so as to ensure that there is indeed no major objection from each other.
    When implementing the method of "piecework", attention should be paid to taking care of heavy work and technical work. Work that is more strenuous or requires higher skills should be given more remuneration. For example, plowing and sowing with a plow is a technical job, and the remuneration should be set higher when setting the standard. If a local medium labor force can sow three mu of land a day, it can be counted as 1.2 labor days; it can also be converted to another algorithm, sowing two and a half mu of land counts as one labor day. Making adobe bricks for building houses, generally a labor force can make more than 500 a day, but because this kind of work is more strenuous, it can be counted as 1.3 labor days; or it can be stipulated that making 400 bricks counts as one labor day.
    There are also some special jobs whose calculation methods are different from general agricultural labor. For example, the labor days of sheep workers are sometimes stipulated that grazing a certain number of sheep and grazing them in a certain way, contracting for a year, and calculating how many labor days or giving how much remuneration, so there is no need to calculate how much each labor day counts. Some are calculated according to the sheep worker's technology, how many labor days are counted per day, and labor days are recorded by day. Another example is the labor days of feeding draft animals. Some are stipulated that they are responsible for feeding and managing the pen and out of the pen, stipulating how much feed is used for each draft animal, how well it is fed (for example, how much weight is gained in how much time), and how many draft animals are fed, which counts as one labor day; some do not stipulate the standard because it is not easy to determine how well it is fed, but only increase or decrease labor days according to the situation during the feeding process. Some sideline workers record labor days by piecework contracting, some record labor days by technology, and some record labor days by income (such as carpenters doing work outside, handing over the wages earned to the cooperative according to a standard slightly higher than the local general agricultural wage standard, and the cooperative records one labor day for him; additional labor days are recorded for the extra payment). Technical personnel in orchards can implement annual contracting according to the number of trees, the level of technology, and the size of income.
    For female members, they should receive due remuneration for the amount and quality of work they do, just like male members. If a female member does the same kind of work as well and as much as a male member, the labor days recorded for her should be the same as for this male member; if a female member does a certain kind of work more and better than a male member, the labor days recorded for her should be more than for this male member; if she does a certain kind of work not as well as a male member, the labor days should also be recorded less. However, the cooperative and the female members themselves should also pay attention to their physical strength and the specific conditions of their current family life. It is not good to damage their health or hinder the normal life of their families just to earn labor days.
    How should labor days be calculated for the cooperative's cadres? When the cooperative is first organized, if the cooperative is not too large and the affairs of the cooperative are not too complicated, they should also participate in agricultural or sideline production labor and record labor days in the same way as ordinary members; at this time, the members generally do not understand the importance and necessity of the cadres' mental labor, and the time spent on mental labor is not too much. If they do not participate in physical labor, they will be divorced from the masses. Only when they miss work for the cooperative should they be given a score and recorded work appropriately. If the cooperative has the conditions for expansion and expands into a large cooperative, after discussion by the members and with everyone's consent, a certain remuneration can be given to one or two cadres who specialize in managing the work within the cooperative (such as the director and the accountant).
    The above methods have all been adopted by many cooperatives. Some of them can be used by general cooperatives, and some still need to be improved; at the same time, the conditions in different regions and different cooperatives are different, and the same method cannot be adopted uniformly. Better methods still need to be constantly studied, created, and summarized by cadres and members in various places.
    No matter what method is adopted, there are two principles that must be adhered to: one is that it must be carefully discussed by the members and agreed upon by everyone; the other is that it must be as fair and reasonable as possible, and be able to give play to the enthusiasm for labor and improve labor efficiency. Only in this way can the superiority of collective labor be demonstrated and the positive role of remuneration according to labor be brought into play.

    农业生产合作社怎样计算劳动日
    史林琪
    农业生产合作社里，要实行一定的按劳取酬。可是在劳动生产中，一勤一懒，一紧一松，差别就很大，该怎么办呢？说是按“劳动日”计算，要是每一天劳动的好坏多少不一样怎么办呢？干的好干的多，干一天也算一个“劳动日”，干的坏干的少，干一天也算一个“劳动日”，那谁还肯加劲用心干活呢？
    这的确是办社的一个十分重要的问题。这个问题解决不好，就会妨碍社里的生产，也会影响社员的收入。对于社员来说有人会吃亏，有人会占便宜；对于全社来说，总的结果会是大家都受损失。因此，必须把计算劳动日（一般也叫“计工”）的工作做好。
    可以采取两种计算方法
    根据过去已经办好的一些农业生产合作社的经验，劳动日的计算，大体上有两种方法：
    一种计算方法是“死分活评”，就是：按劳动力强弱，技术高低，评出每个人的“底分”；再按每个人实际劳动的情形，好的加分，差的减分，相差不大的就仍按原来评定的“底分”记工，每十分算一个劳动日。比如有的人技术好，劳力强，“底分”评成十分。但是，他在做活的时候不积极，做的粗或者慢，那么，在记劳动日（一般也叫“记工”）的时候，就要减分；如果他做得特别好，特别快，很显著地比别人强，那么，在记劳动日的时候，就应当加分；如果有五天每天都加了两分，那么，他做了五天活就算做了六个劳动日。也有的根据他的劳动力强弱和一般农活上的技术情况，“底分”只评成七分。但是他有某种专长，比如他专长锄苗，锄得比别人又好，又快，那么在锄苗的时候，就应当按他锄的实际情况给他加分。
    另一种计算方法是“按件计工”，就是根据农活难易、轻重、技术活和一般活，以及农忙、农闲不同季节，分别定出各项农活的质量（做得好坏）标准，然后按一个中等劳动力在一天中能完成的数量（做的多少）为标准，作为一个劳动日。凡做够这个标准的，就记一个劳动日，超过标准的就增加，不足的就减少。比如：锄苗，要锄得怎样细、怎样匀；依这个质量标准，一个中等劳动力一天能锄三亩，那么“锄三亩，锄得怎样细、匀”就是计算锄苗的劳动日的标准。如果锄的质量够得上细、匀的标准，数量又超过了，比如锄了四亩半，那就应当记一个半劳动日。如果只锄了一亩或一亩半，那就只记一个劳动日的三分之一或者一半。不过，也有一些农活是不许超过数量标准的，比如规定用两头骡子，一天耕地六亩半，耕六寸深，再耙一次，地面平整，就记一个劳动日；达不到标准的少记，但不能超过。这是因为要保护牲口，不使它过于受累。
    这两种办法，前一种比较简单好办，但不够合理，定“底分”不容易准确，在“活评”的时候也没有一定标准，评定时比较困难，只能做到大体公平。第二种办法比较合理，但是计算起来相当复杂，在现在的条件下，经验少，农活杂，还很难件件都去精确计算。所以，现在一般农业生产合作社都是两种办法同时采用。凡是容易计算数量、质量标准的，或是容易计算个人劳动的数量的（比如：担粪、担多少担；摘棉花，摘多少斤等等），就可以按件计工；有些不容易计算的，或者是需要几个人同时做的，不可能计算每个人的做工数量，就只能采取“小组包工，个人活评”的办法，来评定各人的劳动日。比如锄苗，虽然可以规定锄多少、锄什么样算一个劳动日，但是不能一个人去锄一块地，而要几个人同时在一块地里去锄，那么就定出来锄这块地总共需要多少劳动日，包给这几个人；做完以后，他们互相评定一下各个人的劳动日就行了。
    应当适合各种具体条件
    计算社员的劳动日，这件工作很复杂。因为农业生产合作社的劳动力多，有强有弱，技术高低不同，各人的专长也不同，有的专长犁地，有的专长播种，有的专长锄苗，有的专长喂养牲口，等等；同时，社里的活计又多又杂，有农业有副业，还有轻、重、巧、笨、粗、细、忙、闲等等不同。有这么多不同的人，这么多不同的事，就要算得精、算得准，才能公平合理。但是，根据目前农业生产合作社的条件，还不可能完全一下子就都能又精又准地计算出来。只能随着生产的发展和经验的增长，一步步改进。
    在实行“死分活评”的办法时，应当注意不要“扣”得太死，不要一点一滴都去死争，只要大体上公平互相没有多大意见就行了；但也不能太马虎，也要根据做活的实际情况，去互相评定，要做到确实互相没有什么大意见。
    在实行“按件计工”的办法时，要注意照顾重活和技术活，活比较吃力或者需要较高的技术的，应当多算一些报酬。比如扶犁播种，是技术活，定标准时就应当把报酬定高一点，如果当地中等劳力一天能种三亩地，可以算做一·二个劳动日；也可以换一个算法，种二亩半地算一个劳动日。打盖房子用的坯，一般一个劳动力一天能打五百多个，但因为这种活比较吃力，可以算做一·三个劳动日；或者规定成打四百个坯算一个劳动日。
    还有些特殊工，计算方法和一般农业劳动也有不同。比如羊工的劳动日，有的是规定放多少羊，放成什么样，一年包下来，算给多少劳动日，或给多少报酬，这就不去计算每个劳动日算多少了。有的是根据羊工技术，一天算多少劳动日，按天记劳动日。又如饲养耕畜的劳动日，有的是规定负责饲养并且管垫圈、出圈，规定每头耕畜用草料多少，饲养成什么样（比如多少时间长膘多少），饲养多少耕畜等，算一个劳动日；有的因饲养成什么样不好定，就不规定标准，只是规定在饲养过程中看情况增减劳动日。副业工有的是按件包工记劳动日，有的是按技术记劳动日，有的是按收入记劳动日（如木工在外做活，按稍高于当地一般农业工资标准把所得工资交给社里，社里给他记一个劳动日；多交的加记劳动日）。果园的技术人员，可以按树木多少，技术高低，收入大小，实行全年包工。
    对于女社员，应该按照她们做的工作的多少和好坏，和男社员一样，得到应有的报酬。同样一种活计，一个女社员做得和一个男社员同样好同样多，给她记的劳动日就应该和这个男社员一个样；一个女社员做某一种活比一个男社员做这种活做得又多又好，给她记的劳动日就应该比这个男社员多；做某一种活比不上男社员，劳动日也应当少记。不过，社里和女社员自己也要注意她们的体力和当前家庭生活的具体条件，只是为了挣劳动日，损害了身体健康或者妨害了家庭的正常生活，也是不好的。
    给社里的干部怎样计算劳动日呢？在合作社开始组织起来的时候，如果社还不太大，社里的事情还不太复杂，他们还应该参加农业或副业生产劳动和一般社员同样记劳动日；这时，社员群众一般还不了解干部的脑力劳动的重要和必要，脑力劳动占的时间也还不太多，他们如果不参加体力劳动，就会脱离群众。只是在他们为社里办事误了工的时候，应该酌量地给评分记工。社具备了扩大的条件，扩充成大社了，经过社员讨论，大家同意，对于一两个专门管理社内工作的干部（比如主任和会计），可以给他们一定的报酬。
    以上这些办法，都是许多社采用过的，有些是一般社都可以用的，有些是还需要改进的；同时，各地区、各个社的条件不同，也不能千篇一律地采取同一个办法。更好的办法，还要各地干部和社员群众不断地研究、创造、总结。
    不论采取什么办法，有两条原则是必须坚持的：一条是要经过社员仔细讨论，取得大家同意；一条是要尽量做到公平合理，能够发挥劳动的积极性，提高劳动效率。只有这样，才能显示出来集体劳动的优越性，发挥按劳取酬的积极作用。
