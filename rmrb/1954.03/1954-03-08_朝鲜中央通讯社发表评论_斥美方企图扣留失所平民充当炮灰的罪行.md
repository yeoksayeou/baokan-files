Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 7th. The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 6th, condemning the US side's crimes of forcibly detaining displaced civilians.

The commentary wrote: The US side is arrogantly trampling on the provisions of the armistice agreement, attempting to forcibly detain a large number of our displaced civilians. On March 2nd, the US side only repatriated 37 of our displaced civilians. This is 33 fewer than the number the US side formally notified us on February 18th, and one fewer than the number the US side submitted on February 27th. Two displaced civilians included in the list already submitted to us by the US side were also not repatriated. The commentary pointed out: However, in South Korea, under US military control, there is a large number of displaced civilians who were abducted from our areas during the war. These displaced civilians are scattered throughout South Korea, all longing to return to their hometowns as soon as possible. The reason why the US side wants to forcibly detain our displaced civilians is the same as the US side forcibly detaining our prisoners of war and handing them over to the Li and Chiang bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. Their purpose is to use the displaced civilians as cannon fodder and slaves.

The commentary pointed out: The US side has committed various atrocities in order to forcibly detain our displaced civilians. According to the revelations of repatriated displaced civilians: the US side, in its military control areas, did not implement the provision of widely announcing the content of Article 59 of the armistice agreement, nor did it provide the displaced civilians with conditions to ensure their return home. The US side used force, threats, and deception to prevent displaced civilians from registering, and even forcibly cancelled their right to register. Taking Geoje Island as an example, there are more than 600 displaced civilians in Jangseungpo on the island, all of whom hoped to return home, but after being "reviewed" by five "review offices," they had to be forced to "give up" their wish to return home due to US coercion.

The commentary emphasized: The ragged and haggard appearance of the repatriated displaced civilians is a true portrayal of the lives of our displaced civilians who are forcibly detained in large numbers in South Korea by the US side. All our displaced civilians hope to return home, but due to US obstruction, they continue to live a miserable life in South Korea. The Korean people, together with all kind people in the world, must not allow US imperialism to forcibly detain our displaced civilians. The US side should thoroughly implement the provisions of the armistice agreement and repatriate all our displaced civilians who are still scattered in South Korea. If the US side does not abandon its sinister attempt to forcibly detain our displaced civilians and continues to trample on Article 59 of the armistice agreement, then it must bear the responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 7th. Returned displaced civilians from our side revealed that in Gyeongsangnam-do, South Korea alone, at least 1,100 displaced civilians from our side registered to return home, but were forcibly detained by the US side using terror tactics.

On Geoje Island, there are approximately 100,000 displaced civilians from our side. Due to the US side's methods of forced detention, not a single person has been able to return. Kim Yong-bok, a repatriated displaced civilian, heard from people coming from Yeoncho-myeon on Geoje Island shortly before leaving Masan in South Korea that in Yeoncho-myeon alone, more than 600 displaced civilians from our side had registered to return home. However, after these people registered, US police, military police, and secret agents threatened them, forcing them to cancel their registration. The secret agents openly threatened them, saying that those who demanded to return home were "red elements" and would be severely punished. Displaced civilian Lee Geum-ja was visited ten times by plainclothes US police on February 17th and 18th after registering in early February, scaring her into hiding in her neighbor's house. The police threatened that if she wanted to return home, she would have to leave her nine-year-old child behind. Some displaced civilians who registered to return home were arrested by the police, tortured, and then forced to cancel their registration.

Won Tae-sook, a displaced civilian who returned from Busan, was summoned to the Li bandit police station for questioning after registering. Inside the police station, she saw four other men who had registered to return home being taken to prison for insisting on returning home despite the threats of the Li bandit police. In Busan, many other displaced civilians from our side were unable to return home after registering because the US side deliberately did not tell them the date and assembly point for repatriation. Kim Bal, a friend of Lee Ki-jong, a repatriated displaced civilian from our side, was unable to return for this reason. Kim Dong-sik, another displaced civilian who returned from Busan, said that after his friends Joo Kwon-cheol and Joo Saeng-geum registered to return home, the Li bandit newspaper spread rumors that they had automatically cancelled their registration, and the Syngman Rhee displaced persons registration agency forced them to cancel their registration based on these rumors.

Because the US side adopted these despicable and shameless methods to prevent displaced civilians from returning home, a very terrifying atmosphere was created among the displaced civilians, making many displaced civilians who were willing to return home afraid to register.

The US side shamelessly claimed that they had widely publicized the agreement on the repatriation of civilians between the two sides. The repatriated displaced civilians unanimously revealed that this was a most shameless and vile rumor. None of the thirty-seven repatriated displaced civilians had heard the US side's broadcast about the repatriation of displaced civilians, nor had they seen any promotional materials of this content. The US side not only did not widely publicize the agreement on the repatriation of displaced civilians, but also violated many provisions of the armistice agreement, depriving displaced civilians of their right to return home. Kim Yong-bok, a returned displaced civilian, said that the US-Li bandit gang had illegally announced that displaced civilians who had not lived in a place for at least six months were not allowed to register, and his friend Kim Gye-jeon was refused registration for this reason. In Busan and other places, the US-Li bandit gang also illegally announced that registration for displaced civilians would be closed on February 18th, and many displaced civilians who went to register after February 18th were therefore refused.

    斥美方企图扣留失所平民充当炮灰的罪行
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜中央通讯社六日发表评论，斥责美方强迫扣留失所平民的罪行。
    评论写道：美方正在蛮横地蹂躏着停战协定的规定，企图大量强迫扣留我方失所平民，三月二日，美方从我方失所平民中仅仅遣返了三十七名。这比美方在二月十八日正式通知我方的数字少了三十三名，比美方二月二十七日提出的数字又少了一名。还有两名包括在美方已提交给我方的名单中的失所平民也没有被遣返。评论指出：但是，在美方军事控制下的南朝鲜，有着在战争期间被从我方地区掳走的大批失所平民。这些失所平民流落在南朝鲜各地，都渴望早日返回家乡。美方之所以要强迫扣留我方失所平民，正像美方强迫扣留我方战俘交给李、蒋匪帮充当炮灰一样，其目的是要把失所平民也拿来充当炮灰和奴隶。
    评论指出：美方为了强迫扣留我方失所平民而制造了各种暴行。据遣返归来的失所平民揭露：美方在它的军事控制地区内，并没有执行广泛宣布停战协定第五十九款内容的规定，更没有给失所平民以保障他们能够返回家乡的条件。美方用武力威胁和欺骗手段阻挠失所平民登记，甚至强迫取消了失所平民登记的权利。以巨济岛为例，该岛长承浦有六百多名失所平民，他们都希望返乡，但经过五个“审查所”的“审查”以后，由于美方的胁迫，他们不得不被迫“放弃”了返乡的愿望。
    评论强调指出：遣返归来的失所平民的那种褴褛和憔悴的样子，是被美方大量强迫扣留在南朝鲜的我方失所平民真实生活情况的一个写照。所有我方失所平民都是希望返乡的，但由于美方的阻挠，继续流落在南朝鲜过着悲惨的生活。朝鲜人民与全世界善良人民一起，绝不能容许美帝国主义强迫扣留我方失所平民。美方应彻底执行停战协定的规定，遣返现仍流落在南朝鲜的一切我方失所平民。如果美方不放弃强迫扣留我方失所平民的罪恶企图，继续蹂躏停战协定第五十九款的话，那么，它就必须承担由此而引起的一切后果的责任。
    【新华社开城七日电】归来的我方失所平民揭露：仅仅在南朝鲜的庆尚南道，至少有一千一百多名我方失所平民登记要求返乡，但是被美方用恐怖手段强迫扣留下来。
    在巨济岛上约有近十万名我方失所平民，由于美方的强迫扣留的手段，没有一个人能够回来。归来的我方失所平民金龙福在离开南朝鲜的马山前不久，曾听到从巨济岛上来的人说，仅巨济岛延草面一地就曾有六百多名我方失所平民登记要求返乡。但是，在这些人登记以后，美方警察、宪兵和特务就对他们进行威胁，强迫他们取消登记。特务们公然恫吓他们说，要求返乡的就是“赤色分子”，要遭到严厉的处罚。失所平民李金子在二月初旬登记后，美方便衣警察在二月十七、十八两天曾来逮捕她十次，吓得她藏到邻居家里去。警察扬言说：如果她要回乡，就要把她九岁的孩子留下来。有的登记返乡的失所平民被警察捕去拷打一顿，然后被强迫取消登记。
    从釜山归来的失所平民元太淑在登记以后，曾被李匪警察署叫去审问，她在警察署内看到另外四个已经登记返乡的男子因为不顾李匪警察的威胁坚持返乡而被押入监狱。在釜山，还有许多我方失所平民登记后因为美方故意不告诉他们返乡日期和集中地点而无法返乡，归来的我方失所平民李基钟的朋友金发就是因为这样而没有能够回来。另一个从釜山归来的失所平民金铜植说，他的朋友朱权哲和朱生今登记返乡以后，李匪报纸造谣说他们已自动取消了登记，李承晚的登记失所平民的机关就根据这些谣言强迫他们取消了登记。
    由于美方采取这种卑鄙无耻的手段阻止失所平民返乡，在失所平民中造成了一种十分恐怖的气氛，使得许多愿意返乡的失所平民不敢去登记了。
    美方曾无耻地声称：他们曾广泛地宣传双方有关平民返乡的协议，归来的我方失所平民一致揭露，这完全是一种最无耻、最卑劣的谣言。归来的三十七名失所平民都没有听到过美方有关失所平民返乡的广播，也没有看到过这种内容的宣传品。美方不但没有广泛宣传关于失所平民返乡的协议，反而作了许多违反停战协定的规定，剥夺失所平民返乡的权利。归来的失所平民金龙福说：美李匪帮曾非法宣布：失所平民在一地居住不满六个月者不许登记，他的朋友金计全就因为这个缘故被拒绝进行登记。在釜山等地，美李匪帮还非法宣布失所平民的登记到二月十八日截止，许多在二月十八日以后去登记的失所平民都因此遭到拒绝。
