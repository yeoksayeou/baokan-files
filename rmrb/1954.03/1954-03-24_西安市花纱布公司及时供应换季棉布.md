    Xi'an Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Promptly Supplies Seasonal Cotton Cloth
    The Xi'an Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company vigorously organizes the supply of seasonal goods according to the needs of the people.
    In January, the Xi'an Municipal Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, in accordance with the supply plan, had already shipped a large quantity of spring and summer supplies from East China in advance. The storefront windows display various light-colored printed cotton cloth, bleached cloth, large-patterned serge, and gabardine. The red cloth, brown cloth, and blue cloth produced by the Xi'an New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, as well as the recently produced indanthrene cloth, have also been put on the market in large quantities. There are also newly arrived imported printed cotton cloth, Gaoyang printed cotton cloth, various poplins, floral linen fabrics, and Hong Kong lawn. In the internal sample room, people can see hundreds of different seasonal printed cotton cloths, including more than one hundred kinds of summer light-colored printed cotton cloth and poplin. At present, the number of customers at the Xi'an Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's storefronts is increasing daily, and they are purchasing summer cotton cloth in large quantities. Among the sales of cotton cloth, the sales volume of printed cotton cloth has increased the most. For example, in January, the company's printed cotton cloth group and supply group only sold more than 3,000 bolts of light-colored printed cotton cloth, but in February, the sales volume increased more than threefold. The supply group's supply of various poplins to cooperatives, department stores, and trading companies in February also increased by more than 50% compared with January. The sales volume of other items such as light indanthrene, Hong Kong lawn, imported printed cotton cloth, and poplin have also increased significantly. The most popular of these cotton cloths among consumers is the worker-peasant-soldier light-colored printed cotton cloth produced in East China. The patterns and color schemes of some of these cotton cloths are even imitated from Soviet printed cotton cloth. The newly transferred Fuliduo printed cotton cloth, Shimei printed cotton cloth, and Gaoyang printed cotton cloth are also very popular due to their novel patterns and colors.
    The Xi'an Municipal Company will strengthen its investigation and research on the needs of urban and rural people based on the internal sample exhibition room and storefront sales situation, organize sources of goods, and prepare the second quarter's procurement plan. When organizing sources of goods, it will also actively support and guide the production of local textile and printing and dyeing industries. (Zhang Baolin)

    西安市花纱布公司及时供应换季棉布
    中国花纱布公司西安市公司根据人民需要大力组织供应换季商品。
    中国花纱布公司西安市公司在一月份已按照供应计划把大量春、夏季需用物资自华东提前运到，门市部的橱窗里陈列着各色各样的浅花布、漂白布和大花哔叽、贡呢，西安新西北印染厂出品的红布、酱布、蓝布和最近出厂的士林布，也已大量上市，还有新到的进口花布、高阳花布、各色府绸、花麻纱和香港罗等。在内部样品室里，人们可以看到数百种不同季节的花布，其中夏季浅花布、府绸等就已有一百多种。现在西安市花纱布公司门市部顾客日有增加，他们大批购进夏季棉布。在棉布的销量中以花布的销售量增加最大，如一月份该公司花布组和供应组浅花布只销出三千多匹，到二月份销量就增加了三倍多；供应组二月份供应给合作社、百货、贸易公司的各种府绸也较一月份增加了百分之五十以上。其他如浅士林、香港罗、进口花布和府绸等的销售量都大有增加。这些棉布中最受消费者欢迎的是华东生产的工农兵浅花布，这种棉布的花色，有些还是仿照苏联花布的图案、配色来印染的。新调来的福利多花布、时美花布、高阳花布等，因花样、色泽都很新颖，也很受欢迎。
    西安市公司将根据内部样品展览室和门市销售情况，加强调查研究城乡人民的需要，组织货源，做好第二季度的进货计划，在组织货源时，还要积极扶植与指导地方纺织、印染工业的生产。（张宝林）
