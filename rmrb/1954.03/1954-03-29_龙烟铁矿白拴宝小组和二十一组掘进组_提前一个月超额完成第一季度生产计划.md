The Bai Shuanbao Team and the Twenty-First Excavation Team of the Western Mining Department of Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province exceeded their first quarter production plans one month ahead of schedule.

The Bai Shuanbao Team and the Twenty-First Team of the Western Mining Department of Longyan Iron Mine completed the first quarter production plan one month ahead of schedule on February 28. The Bai Shuanbao Team exceeded the plan by 12.67 percent, and the Twenty-First Team exceeded it by 6.149 percent.

Last year, the workers of the Bai Shuanbao Team completed the annual production plan sixty days ahead of schedule. After the entire team thoroughly and systematically studied the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, their enthusiasm for labor was further enhanced. Therefore, in January of this year, they formulated an advanced plan to complete the annual production task one hundred days ahead of schedule. Now, the first quarter plan has been successfully realized. After studying the general line, the workers of the Twenty-First Team have increased their enthusiasm. Both teams actively improved their operating techniques based on their experience. The Bai Shuanbao Team improved the center slotting and bottoming operating methods. The workers of the Twenty-First Team learned the operating method of using large and small drill bits to drill "quartzite" from the Ma Wanshui Team, which greatly improved production efficiency.

Now, all the workers of these two teams have expressed that they will continue their efforts, further study technology, and unleash their potential to strive for the early completion of the 1954 production plan!

    河北省龙烟铁矿西部采矿部白拴宝小组和二十一组掘进组，提前一个月超额完成第一季度计划。
    龙烟铁矿西部采矿部白拴宝小组和二十一组，在二月二十八日提前一个月完成第一季度生产计划，白拴宝小组超额百分之十二点六七；二十一组超额百分之六点一四九。
    去年白拴宝小组工人，提前六十天完成了全年生产计划。全组工人经过深入地、系统地学习了党在国家过渡时期总路线总任务后，劳动热情更加提高了，因此他们在今年一月份，就订出了提前一百天完成全年生产任务的先进计划。现在第一季度的计划，已经胜利地实现了。二十一组的工人，经过总路线学习后，工人的积极性提高了。这两个小组都根据他们的经验，积极改进操作技术，白拴宝小组改进了中心掏槽和拉槽卧底等操作法，二十一组工人学习了马万水小组用大小头钎子打“石英岩”的操作方法，生产效率大大提高。
    现在，这两个小组全体工人表示要再接再厉，进一步钻研技术，发挥潜在力量，为提前完成一九五四年度生产计划而奋斗！
