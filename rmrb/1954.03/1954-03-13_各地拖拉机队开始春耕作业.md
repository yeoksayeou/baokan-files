Tractor teams across the country begin spring ploughing operations

[This newspaper's report] Agricultural machine tractor stations, tractor work teams, and state farm tillage teams across the country are about to comprehensively begin spring ploughing operations. The main tasks for this spring's operations are ploughing, harrowing, and sowing. According to incomplete statistics from agricultural machine tractor stations in places like Huachuan, Keshan, Hailong, Shenyang, Shuangcheng, Yushu, Beijing, Changzhi, Jiaoxian, Xihua, Bo'ai, and the Yiliba and Gaokan Village agricultural machine tractor work teams, as well as tillage teams from some state farms, this spring they will plough more than 80,000 mu of land for nine collective farms and 119 agricultural cooperatives, harrow more than 100,000 mu, and sow more than 70,000 mu. Currently, some stations and teams have already begun spring ploughing operations, such as the Beijing station, which has dispatched ten machines to plough land and roll wheat fields for cooperatives in Heiqiao, Sanjiaocun, and Zhangguozhuang.

In order to further maximize the effectiveness of machine cultivation and ensure the completion of this year's production increase targets, all stations and teams have successively carried out work inspections and revisions of regulations, and have completely overhauled more than 60 tractors, more than 130 ploughs and harrows, more than 50 seeders, and more than 30 rollers used in this year's spring ploughing. At the same time, all stations and teams have also cooperated with the villages and cooperatives they serve in carrying out various spring ploughing preparations. For example, the Huachuan station helped the villages and cooperatives it serves to generally check the quality and germination rate of spring wheat seeds, and the Shuangcheng station helped cooperatives exchange high-quality wheat seeds capable of planting 20 hectares of land. The Changzhi station helped the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm carefully select and sun-dry more than 15,000 jin of seeds. All stations and teams are also preparing to train more than 200 agricultural technicians for the villages and cooperatives during the spring ploughing operations.

Due to the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the attractiveness of the superiority of machine cultivation, the number of units served by each station and team this year, especially the number of households served and the area of cultivated land, have increased significantly. Taking the Beijing station as an example, the service targets have expanded from 130 households in six cooperatives last year to 1,550 households in 32 cooperatives, equivalent to twelve times last year. The area of cultivated land has expanded from 3,000 mu last year to 25,000 mu. The area of cultivated land served by the Bo'ai station has also expanded from 1,200 mu to 3,280 mu. For the convenience of machine cultivation, the members have automatically consolidated their land and removed obstacles from the cultivated land. In Bo'ai, the Gaozhuang and Niuwangmiao cooperatives filled four dry wells and removed many trees in the already consolidated land.

Through tillage services, each station and team will work together with the villages and cooperatives they serve to strive to increase the production of more grain and cotton to meet the needs of the country and the people. The Changzhi station and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm have jointly formulated a plan requiring a further increase in output of 24 percent this year on the basis of last year's increase. The Huachuan station is preparing to work together with the tillage service units to increase the average yield of rice to 10,000 jin per hectare this year. The Hailong station is preparing to increase grain production by 122 tons on 550 hectares of cultivated land. The Beijing station plans to increase cotton production on cultivated land from 162 jin to 200 jin.

    各地拖拉机队开始春耕作业
    【本报讯】各地农业机器拖拉机站、拖拉机工作队和国营农场代耕队即将全面开始春耕作业。今春作业的主要内容是耕、耙和播种。据桦川、克山、海龙、沈阳、双城、榆树、北京、长治、胶县、西华、博爱等农业机器拖拉机站和依力巴、高坎村农业机器拖拉机工作队和部分国营农场代耕队的不完全统计，今春将为九个集体农庄、一百一十九个农业合作社耕地八万多亩、耙地十万多亩、播种七万多亩。目前，部分站、队已经开始春耕作业，如北京站就已出动十台机器替黑桥、三角村、张郭庄等合作社耕地和镇压麦田。
    为了进一步发挥机器耕作效能、保证完成今年增产任务，各站、队先后进行了工作检查和制度修订等工作，并全部检修了今年春耕中所使用的六十多台拖拉机、一百三十多台犁和耙、五十多台播种机和三十多台镇压器。同时，各站、队还配合所代耕的庄、社进行了各项春耕准备工作。如桦川站帮助其所服务的庄、社普遍检查了春麦种籽的质量和发芽率，双城站帮助合作社串换了能种二十垧地的优良麦种。长治站帮助中苏友好集体农庄精选和翻晒了一万五千多斤种籽。各站、队还准备在春耕作业中为各庄、社培养二百多个农业技术手。
    由于互助合作运动的迅速发展和机器耕作优越性的吸引，各站、队今年代耕的单位，特别是代耕的户数和耕地面积都有显著的增加。以北京站为例，代耕对象已由去年六个社一百三十户扩大到三十二个社一千五百五十户，相当于去年十二倍。代耕面积已由去年三千亩扩大到二万五千亩。博爱站代耕面积也由一千二百亩扩大到三千二百八十亩。社员们为了机器耕作的便利，都自动进行土地连片和清除耕地中的障碍。博爱的高庄、牛王庙两社在已连片的地中填了四眼枯井、挖去许多树木。
    各站、队通过代耕将和它们所服务的庄、社共同努力争取增产更多的粮食和棉花，以适应国家和人民的需要。长治站和中苏友好集体农庄已共同制订计划，要求今年在去年增产基础上再提高产量百分之二十四。桦川站准备和代耕单位共同努力，使今年水稻每垧平均产量提高到一万斤。海龙站准备在五百五十垧代耕地上增产粮食一百二十二吨。北京站计划使代耕地棉花产量从一百六十二斤提高到二百斤。
