Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th: TASS, Moscow, March 28th -- On March 26th of this year, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister V.V. Kuznetsov handed a note to Mr. M.S. Ali Beg, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Pakistani Embassy in Moscow. The note reads as follows:

"Having received Pakistan's note of December 19, 1953, the Soviet Government considers it necessary to make the following statement:

In its note of November 30, 1953, the Soviet Government referred to reports of negotiations between the Pakistani government and the United States government on the establishment of U.S. air force bases on Pakistani territory and Pakistan's participation in the organization of a Middle East military bloc, and urged the Pakistani government to pay attention to this. It pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot ignore such reports because the establishment of foreign air force bases in Pakistan and Pakistan's participation in the establishment of the aforementioned Middle East bloc have a direct bearing on the security of the Soviet Union.

The subsequent activities of the Pakistani government have proven that the Soviet government had reason to issue the aforementioned note.

From this point of view, the Soviet government cannot consider the Pakistani government's reply of December 19 to the Soviet government's note as satisfactory.

Pakistan's note affirms that the issue of allowing the United States to establish military bases in Pakistan has never existed. However, it may be worthwhile to mention the fact that, according to an interview with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali published in the January 15th issue of "U.S. News & World Report," Mr. Muhammad Ali said that in the event of an "emergency," the Pakistani government would be prepared to hand over to the United States the military bases established with U.S. military assistance. The Prime Minister also said that the Pakistani government plans to have senior U.S. military advisors serve in the Pakistani army headquarters in order to train Pakistani officers.

It is known that on February 25th of this year, the news of the agreement reached between Pakistan and the United States on the United States providing the aforementioned military assistance to Pakistan was announced simultaneously in Karachi and Washington. It can be seen from the above remarks of the Pakistani Prime Minister that, in this regard, the Pakistani government not only undertook the obligation to hand over the military bases in Pakistan to the United States, but also undertook the obligation to place the Pakistani army under the command of a foreign headquarters.

In its note, the Pakistani government completely evaded replying to the question raised in the Soviet government's note regarding Pakistan's participation in the negotiations to establish a Middle East aggression bloc. Both the Pakistan-Turkey official communiqué published in Karachi and Ankara on February 19th of this year, and the aforementioned remarks made by the Pakistani Prime Minister when he met with reporters, show that a military bloc is now being established in the Near and Middle East, with its spearhead aimed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving Asian countries.

However, it is known that Pakistan is not threatened by any aggression, and therefore there is no legitimate reason whatsoever for establishing such a military bloc with Pakistan's participation.

Neither handing over military bases in Pakistan to foreign control, nor Pakistan's participation in a military bloc that serves as a tool of imperialist aggression, stems from any defensive considerations on the part of Pakistan, and is fundamentally inconsistent with Pakistan's true national interests. These steps will not benefit the Pakistani people in the slightest. The Pakistani people, like the people of other countries, are concerned with peace, with defending their independence, and with increasing their well-being.

In view of the above reasons, the Soviet government considers it necessary to call the attention of the Pakistani government to the fact that Pakistan's participation in the aforementioned bloc, as well as allowing U.S. armed forces to establish military bases on Pakistani territory, will inevitably damage relations between the Soviet Union and Pakistan. The Pakistani government should bear responsibility for this situation." Mr. M.S. Ali Beg promised to forward the note to the Pakistani government.

    苏联政府照会巴基斯坦政府
    指出巴基斯坦参加中东侵略集团和让美国在巴基斯坦建立基地势将损害苏巴关系
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日电：今年三月二十六日，苏联外交部副部长瓦·瓦·库兹涅佐夫将一件照会交给巴基斯坦驻莫斯科临时代办米·西·阿里·柏格先生。照会内容如下：
    “在收到巴基斯坦一九五三年十二月十九日的照会之后，苏联政府认为有必要作下列声明：
    苏联政府在一九五三年十一月三十日的照会中曾提到关于巴基斯坦政府与美国政府商谈在巴基斯坦境内建立美国空军基地和巴基斯坦参加组织中东军事集团的计划的消息，并促请巴基斯坦政府加以注意。并且指出，苏联对这一类消息不能置之不理，因为在巴基斯坦建立外国空军基地和巴基斯坦参加建立上述中东集团的计划，对苏联的安全有着直接的关系。
    巴基斯坦政府在以后的一些活动，证明苏联政府提出上述照会是有理由的。
    从这一点考虑，苏联政府不能认为巴基斯坦政府十二月十九日答复苏联政府的照会是令人满意的。
    巴基斯坦的照会肯定地说，让美国在巴基斯坦建立军事基地这样一个问题向来就是不存在的。但是，这里倒不妨提到如下一个事实，即据今年一月十五日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”所刊载的一篇对巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里先生的访问记，穆罕默德·阿里先生曾经说，一旦发生“紧急状态”，巴基斯坦政府准备将依靠美国军事援助而建立的军事基地交给美国支配。总理并说，巴基斯坦政府计划让美国的高级军事顾问在巴基斯坦军队司令部供职，以便训练巴基斯坦军官。
    大家知道，今年二月二十五日，在喀喇蚩和华盛顿同时公布了巴基斯坦和美国所达成的关于美国对巴基斯坦提供上述军事援助的协议的消息。从巴基斯坦总理的上述谈话中可以看出，在这方面，巴基斯坦政府不仅是承担了将巴基斯坦境内的军事基地交给美国支配的义务，而且承担了使巴基斯坦军队实际上受外国司令部指挥的义务。
    巴基斯坦政府在其照会中对苏联政府照会里所提出的关于巴基斯坦参加建立中东侵略集团计划的谈判的问题，完全回避答复。无论是从今年二月十九日喀喇蚩和安卡拉公布的巴基斯坦—土耳其官方公报来看，或是从巴基斯坦总理在接见记者时所发表的上述谈话来看，都可以知道现在正在中近东建立一个矛头针对苏联和其他一些爱好和平的亚洲国家的军事集团。
    然而大家知道，巴基斯坦并没有受到任何侵犯的威胁，因而建立这样一个有巴基斯坦参加的军事集团是根本没有任何正当理由的。
      无论是把巴基斯坦境内的军事基地让外国支配，或是巴基斯坦参加作为帝国主义侵略势力的工具的军事集团，都不是出于巴基斯坦的任何一种防御上的考虑，而且也是和巴基斯坦的真正民族利益根本不相符合的。这些步骤对巴基斯坦人民不会有丝毫好处。巴基斯坦人民和其他各国人民一样，关心和平，关心保卫他们的独立和增进他们的幸福。
    鉴于上述原因，苏联政府认为有必要促请巴基斯坦政府注意这一事实，即巴基斯坦参加上述集团以及让美国武装部队在巴基斯坦境内建立军事基地，势必会损害苏联和巴基斯坦的关系。巴基斯坦政府应为这一情况担负责任。”米·西·阿里·柏格先生答应将照会转呈巴基斯坦政府。
