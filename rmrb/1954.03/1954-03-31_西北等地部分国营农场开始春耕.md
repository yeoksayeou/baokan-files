    Spring plowing begins at some state-owned farms in Northwest and other regions
    State-owned mechanized farms in parts of Northwest, North China, and Northeast China have successively begun spring plowing.
    In the Northwest region, the Lingwu, Caotan, Qianjin, Tacheng, and Mojiaquanwan mechanized farms have successively started production activities such as plowing and harrowing cotton fields and sowing spring wheat since late February. Currently, the Lingwu and Qianjin farms have completed the harrowing of over 9,000 mu of land planned for spring harrowing, and have also completed the sowing of spring wheat and pasture. The Caotan Farm applied some stable manure to the cotton fields, and during spring harrowing, also applied more than 370,000 jin of oil residue to more than 2,000 mu of cotton fields, and is now intensively plowing fertilizer. The total cultivated area of these five farms is more than 62,000 mu, and this year they plan to produce more than 9.8 million jin of grain and 110,000 jin of ginned cotton for the state. The ten state-owned mechanized farms in North China and some farms in southern Northeast China have also started spring plowing operations. The state-owned Shuguang, Ning'an, Jixian, Suibin, and Fuerjihe mechanized farms in Songjiang Province plan to increase grain production by 21,000 tons this year. In order to promote early maturity of wheat and prevent diseases, all wheat seeds were disinfected with Wangtong (copper sulfate) and Ceresan, and sowing was appropriately advanced to begin at the end of March. The Lutai, Shuangqiao, and Wulidian farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government have changed the past phenomenon of spring plowing and sowing being concentrated in April and May due to the implementation of the rotation system and the increase of crop types, staggering the planting seasons. At present, these three farms have completed the sowing of more than 10,000 mu of spring wheat and crops such as alfalfa, and the harrowing and fertilization of more than 7,000 mu of autumn wheat land and other early spring operations. The spring preparation work for late spring crops has also been completed, and fertilizers are being transported and seeds are being carefully selected to prepare for the next stage of work.

    西北等地部分国营农场开始春耕
    西北、华北和东北部分地区的国营机械农场已先后开始春耕。
    西北区的灵武、草滩、前进、塔城、莫家泉湾五个机械农场，从二月下旬以来，便先后开始进行翻耙棉田和播种春小麦等生产活动。目前，灵武、前进两场计划春耙的九千多亩地已全部耙完，春小麦和牧草也已播种完毕。草滩农场在棉田中施了部分厩肥，春耙时又在二千多亩棉田中施了三十七万多斤油渣，现正紧张进行翻耕肥料。这五个场的耕种面积共计六万二千多亩，今年计划为国家生产粮食九百八十多万斤，皮棉十一万斤。华北区的十个国营机械农场和东北南部部分农场也都开始春耕作业。松江省国营曙光、宁安、集贤、绥滨、伏尔基河等五个机械农场，今年计划增产粮食两万一千吨。为了促进小麦早熟，防止病害，全部麦种都用王铜和赛力散进行消毒，并适当提前于三月底开始播种。中央农业部直属芦台、双桥、五里店三农场，由于实行轮作制度，增加作物种类，错开耕种时期，改变了过去春耕春播都集中在四、五月间的现象。目前，这三场已完成一万多亩春麦和苜蓿等作物的播种和七千多亩秋麦地的耙地施肥等早春作业。晚春作物的春季整地和播种准备工作也已做好，现正赶运肥料、精选种籽，为下阶段工作作好准备。（李春桂、宫万钟）
