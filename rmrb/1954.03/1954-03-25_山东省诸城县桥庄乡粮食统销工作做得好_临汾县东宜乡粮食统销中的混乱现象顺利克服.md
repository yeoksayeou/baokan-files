    Shandong Province, Zhucheng County, Qiaozhuang Township, Does a Good Job in Grain Unified Sales
    Chaotic Phenomena in Grain Unified Sales in Dongyi Township, Linfen County, Are Successfully Overcome
    Qiaozhuang Township in the Sixth District of Zhucheng County, Shandong Province, deeply publicized the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Based on raising the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses of farmers, it did a good job in the planned supply of grain.
    Not long after Qiaozhuang Township started the work of unified grain sales, some farmers still had ideological concerns. Thirty percent of the farmers in the township requested a grain supply. Some activists regretted selling grain early because of complaints from their families. The General Branch Committee of the Qiaozhuang Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, based on this situation, first convened an enlarged meeting of the township and village branch committees. It earnestly summarized the previous stage of work and commended fourteen activists who loved the country by selling grain and participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After repeated discussions, the cadres and activists present correctly recognized the achievements of the past three months’ work and the benefits of implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain for farmers. They also examined and criticized the shortcomings in the previous stage of work, such as only managing unified purchases and not unified sales, having no idea about the grain shortage situation, and not deeply publicizing the policy of unified grain sales. On the basis of improved ideological awareness, the cadres present calculated their personal production income and living expenses, made plans to increase production and practice economy, and studied the actual grain shortage situation in the township. Then, the Communist Party members throughout the township, according to the spirit of the meeting, extensively and deeply educated the masses on the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, linking it to examples of the benefits of implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain for farmers. After propaganda and education, the masses of farmers generally reflected: “This time it’s explained thoroughly, and we feel happy. If we had known this earlier, we wouldn't have been so panicked.” The members of the Chen Changde mutual aid team, originally five households requesting grain supply, then all automatically reviewed themselves and said: “We are not short of grain, and it is wrong to ask for a supply!” Cadres and party members also specifically helped the masses make plans to increase production and practice economy. Many households that originally requested grain supply automatically stated that they did not need a supply, and the number of households in the township requesting a grain supply decreased to 7.3% of the total number of households. At the same time, cadres and the masses were very satisfied and actively engaged in production.
    Furthermore, when Dongyi Township in the Sixth District of Linfen County, Shanxi Province, began its planned grain purchase work last year, it supplied a large amount of grain to households short of grain according to the instructions from higher authorities to “purchase and supply simultaneously.” However, at that time, the situation of grain shortage was not clear, and there was great blindness in the supply work. Some households that claimed to be in difficulty but were not actually in difficulty were approved to be supplied with grain, while some households that were really short of grain were not supplied in time. Although more than 18,000 catties of grain were supplied at that time, the masses were still not satisfied. After the planned grain purchase work ended, because many people did not clearly understand the policy of unified grain sales, the number of households requesting grain supply increased even more. Of the 925 households in the township, more than 210 households requested grain supply in January and February.
    With the specific help of county and district cadres, the main cadres of the township held a meeting in early January to study solutions. After the meeting, they convened several meetings of party members, members of the Communist Youth League, activists, and expanded cadre meetings, first to further deeply publicize the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain to them.
    After the cadres' ideological understanding was improved, they organized forces and went deep into the villages separately. They carried out in-depth propaganda and education on the policy of unified grain purchase and sales to the broad masses of people through meetings, people's schools, etc., focusing on the ideological situation of the masses. For example, when conducting propaganda in Dongyi Village, it was found that some grain-deficient households were afraid of difficulty in buying grain in the future, so they over-reported the amount of grain shortage in January and February, and some households that were not grain-deficient wanted to buy some grain under the pretext of living difficulties. They repeatedly explained the policy of unified grain purchase and sales to the masses, making many people realize the mistakes of their original ideas. Combined with the propaganda and education work, local cadres relied on activists among the masses to investigate and understand the actual grain shortage situation in each village. Then, mass meetings were held separately to lead the masses to first have the grain-deficient households report the amount of grain shortage in groups, and conduct evaluation; after the group evaluation, they were submitted to the mass meeting for evaluation and review. At this time, the number of households in the township requesting grain supply in January and February was reduced to more than 100, and the amount of grain requested was reduced by 46% compared with the original.
    In addition, Dongyi Township also simplified the grain supply procedures with the "three-part form" grain purchase certificate, which was welcomed by the masses.

    山东省诸城县桥庄乡粮食统销工作做得好
    临汾县东宜乡粮食统销中的混乱现象顺利克服
    山东省诸城县第六区桥庄乡深入宣传粮食统购统销政策，在提高干部和农民群众思想觉悟的基础上，作好了粮食计划供应工作。
    桥庄乡开展粮食统销工作后不久，有些农民还有思想顾虑。全乡有百分之三十的农户要求供应粮食。有的积极分子因受家庭埋怨，后悔不该提早卖粮。中共桥庄乡总支委员会根据这一情况，首先召开了乡、村支委扩大会议，认真地总结了前段工作，表扬了爱国售粮和参加互助合作运动的积极分子十四人。经过反复讨论，到会干部和积极分子正确认识了三个月来工作的成绩和实行粮食统购统销对农民的好处，并检查批判了前一段工作中的缺点，如只管统购不管统销，对缺粮情况心中无数，没有深入宣传粮食统销政策等。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，到会干部都算了个人生产收入和生活支出的账，订了增产节约计划，并研究了全乡实际缺粮情况。然后，全乡共产党员根据会议精神，联系实行粮食统购统销对农民的好处的实例，广泛深入地向群众进行了粮食统购统销政策的教育。经过宣传教育，农民群众普遍反映：“这回说透彻了，俺也痛快了。早知这样，心里就不慌了。”陈长德互助组组员原来有五户要求供应粮食，这时都自动检讨说：“咱不缺粮，要求供应，真不应该！”干部和党员并具体帮助群众订增产节约的计划。许多原来要求供应粮食的户自动表示不需要供应，全乡要求供应粮食的户减少到占总户数的百分之七点三。同时，干部、群众都很满意，积极投入生产。
    又讯：山西省临汾县第六区东宜乡去年开始进行粮食计划收购工作的时候，就根据上级“边收购、边供应”的指示，对缺粮户供应了大批粮食。但是当时没有摸清缺粮情况，供应工作中盲目性很大。有些叫喊困难而实际上并不困难的户，也被批准供应粮食；有些真正缺粮的户，却没有及时供应。当时虽然供应了一万八千多斤粮食，群众却还不满意。在粮食计划收购工作结束以后，因为不少群众对粮食统销政策了解得不清楚，要求供应粮食的户就更加多了。全乡九百二十五户人家，要求在一、二月份供应粮食的就有二百一十多户。
    在县、区干部具体帮助下，全乡主要干部在一月初开会研究了解决办法。会后，他们一连召开了数次党员、团员积极分子会议和扩大干部会议，首先向他们进一步深入宣传了粮食统购统销政策。
    干部思想认识提高以后，接着便组织力量，分头深入各村，针对群众思想情况，通过会议、民校等向广大群众深入进行了粮食统购统销政策的宣传教育。如在东宜村宣传时，发现有些缺粮户怕以后买粮困难，便多报一、二月份缺粮数量，有些不缺粮的户想借口生活困难购进一些粮食，他们便反复地向群众讲解了粮食统购统销的政策，使许多人认识到原来想法的错误。结合宣传教育工作，当地干部依靠群众中的积极分子调查了解了各村缺粮的实际情况。然后分头召开群众大会，领导群众先分小组让缺粮户自报缺粮数量，进行评议；小组评议后，再提交群众大会上评议、审查。全乡要求在一、二月份供应粮食的户，这时减少为一百余户，要求供应粮食数量比原来减少百分之四十六。
    另外，东宜乡还运用“三联单”购粮证简化了粮食供应手续，受到群众欢迎。
