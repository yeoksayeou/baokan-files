Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 10th: The so-called US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" was signed in Tokyo on the 8th. Accompanying this agreement were three related documents: the "Agreement on Purchasing Surplus Agricultural Products," the "Economic Measures Agreement," and the "Investment Guarantee Agreement," as well as several matters of understanding. These agreements are a new step by the United States to intensify the rearmament of Japan and use it as a tool of aggression, and also a new step by the United States and Japanese reactionaries to intensify the exploitation and enslavement of the Japanese people.

The joint US-Japan communique issued after the signing of the agreement pointed out that the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" was concluded in accordance with the US "Mutual Security Act." This law stipulates that recipient countries must do their utmost to contribute to the expansion, strengthening, and maintenance of the so-called "defense of the free world" and actively take "all reasonable measures" necessary for the development of their own military forces. The agreement did not specify the actual figures for "assistance," which will be determined in future negotiations. However, the Associated Press said that Washington American officials indicated that "most of this military aid is 'heavy stuff' -- major military equipment for the various military departments that Japan plans to expand." United Press International pointed out: "The weapons that Japan will receive under this agreement constitute the cornerstone of the Yoshida government's 'new look' defense plan proposed in the 1954 fiscal year budget and its two defense bills (referring to the 'Self-Defense Forces Law' and the 'Defense Agency Organization Law')."

The US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" also stipulates the establishment of a supreme command to supervise and control Japan's rearmament -- the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group," whose expenses are to be provided by the Japanese side.

The so-called "Agreement on Purchasing Surplus Agricultural Products" and the "Economic Measures Agreement" are a cruel exploitation of the Japanese people. The United States wants to transfer its agricultural crisis to Japan under the guise of "aid," sell surplus agricultural products in Japan, and then use money taken from the Japanese people to strengthen Japan's arms production. The "Agreement on Purchasing Surplus Agricultural Products" stipulates that the United States will sell surplus agricultural products such as wheat worth 50 million US dollars in Japan, and in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the "Economic Measures Agreement," 20 percent of the resulting yen (i.e., 10 million US dollars) will be used under American control to support Japan's military industry, while the remaining 80 percent (i.e., 40 million US dollars) will be used to order munitions in Japan for the American-armed puppet regimes in Asia.

The United States has also used "aid" as a weapon to open the door for further penetration and exploitation of Japan by American capital. The "Investment Guarantee Agreement" stipulates that American investors can remit profits from investments out of Japan and withdraw capital at a rate of 20 percent per year after two years.

The United States is also attempting to drag Japan into a Pacific aggression group through the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." Although US Ambassador to Japan Allison, in his speech at the signing of the agreement, nervously claimed that "you can absolutely not find any provision in the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement that would send Japanese youth abroad," and hypocritically expressed "concern" about the "misunderstanding" of "certain people" in this regard, the "Asahi Shimbun" pointed out: "In this agreement, there is nothing to indicate that Japan's defense forces will not be sent overseas to fight on foreign territory." The "Mainichi Shimbun" further pointed out that this agreement places on Japan the obligation to rearm, "which is in line with the US government's hope that Japan will one day, as a member of the Pacific Pact, share common responsibilities with other countries of the free world." A United Press International dispatch from Tokyo after the signing of the agreement more directly pointed out that the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" and the US-Japan "Security Treaty" signed in 1951 "will eventually lead to Japan and other Asian countries joining a US-backed Pacific Pact."

### 加紧重新武装日本，奴役和剥削日本人民  美国和吉田政府签订“共同防御援助协定”

    加紧重新武装日本，奴役和剥削日本人民
    美国和吉田政府签订“共同防御援助协定”
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：所谓美日“共同防御援助协定”已于八日在东京签订。随同这个协定签订的还有“购买剩余农产品协定”、“经济措施协定”和“保障投资协定”三个有关文件和若干谅解事项。这些协定是美国加紧重新武装日本、使它充当侵略工具的新步骤，也是美国和日本反动派加紧剥削、奴役日本人民的新步骤。
    协定签字后发表的美日联合公报指明：美日“共同防御援助协定”是根据美国“共同安全法”缔结的。这个法律规定：受“援”国必须尽力对扩充、加强和维持所谓“自由世界的防御”有所贡献，并积极地采取对发展本身军事力量所必要的“一切合理措施”。协定未规定“援助”的实际数字，要留待以后的谈判来决定。但美联社说：华盛顿美国官方人士表明，“这些军事援助大都是‘重家伙’——供日本计划要扩充的各军事部门用的主要军事装备”。合众社指出：“日本根据这个协定将得到的武器，构成为吉田政府在一九五四会计年度预算和它在两个防御法案（指‘自卫队法’和‘防卫厅组织法’）中所提出的‘新面貌’防御计划的基石。”
    美日“共同防御援助协定”还规定设立一个监督和控制日本重整军备的太上司令部——“美国军事援助顾问团”，它的经费由日方供给。
    所谓“购买剩余农产品协定”和“经济措施协定”，是对日本人民的残酷剥削。美国要假“援助”之名，向日本转嫁美国的农业危机，在日本销售过剩农产品，然后以取自日本人民的金钱来加强日本军火生产。“购买剩余农产品协定”规定美国以五千万美元的剩余小麦等农产品在日本出售，并按照“经济措施协定”所规定的条件在美国控制下以所得的日元的百分之二十（即一千万美元）用来扶植日本的军火工业，其余百分之八十（即四千万美元）在日本订购美国武装亚洲各傀儡政权的军火。
    美国并以“援助”为武器替美国资本进一步渗入和剥削日本敞开了大门。“保障投资协定”规定美国投资者可以将投资的利润汇出日本，并在两年以后以每年百分之二十的比例将资金提出。
    美国还企图通过美日“共同防御援助协定”把日本拖入太平洋侵略集团。美国驻日大使艾利逊在协定签字时发表的演说中虽然做贼心虚地硬说：“你在共同防御援助协定里绝对找不出使日本派遣青年到国外去的任何规定”，并且伪善地对“某些人士”在这方面的“误解”表示“担心”，但是“朝日新闻”指出：“在这个协定中，没有任何东西表明日本的防御部队不会被送到海外去在外国领土上作战。”“每日新闻”更指出：这个协定使日本承担了重整军备的义务，“这一点是适合于美国政府希望日本能有一天作为太平洋公约的一员，与其他自由世界的国家一道分担共同责任的计划的。”合众社在协定签字后从东京发出的消息中更直接指出：美日“共同防御援助协定”和一九五一年签订的美日“安全条约”“最后会导向日本和其他一些亚洲国家一起参加一个美国支持的太平洋公约”。
