    China National Department Store Hebei Province Company Vigorously Supports Local State-Owned Industry
    Since studying the general line of the state during the transition period, all cadres of the China National Department Store Hebei Province Company have recognized the importance of local state-owned industry in supplying the people's living needs, and that expanding the sales of local state-owned industrial products is an important task of the state-owned commercial sector. They have actively signed sales contracts with seventeen local state-owned industrial enterprises in the province, such as the Shanhaiguan Fruit Candy Factory, Hengshui Battery Factory, Tangshan Paper Mill, and Knitting Factory. In mid-February, the provincial company convened a meeting of business cadres from department stores and supply stations throughout the province. Everyone focused on criticizing the past management thinking of neglecting to support local industrial production. At the meeting, the annual product plans of the seventeen local state-owned factories that had already been underwritten were appropriately divided according to regional characteristics and the needs of the masses, in order to meet the needs of farmers.
    In addition to expanding the sales channels for local state-owned industrial products, the company also investigates and researches the sales situation of local state-owned products, and promptly informs the producing factories of the opinions of consumers, especially farmers, regarding popular commodities and colors, and helps them improve production. For example, the inexpensive and good-quality "42" women's socks, which are now popular in rural Hebei, were previously produced in very small quantities by the Baoding Knitting Factory. After the company's suggestion, the Baoding Knitting Factory expanded the production of "42" women's socks. This not only met the needs of the people, but also opened up sales channels for the factory's products. (Shang Fuxiang)

    中国百货公司河北省公司大力扶植地方国营工业
    中国百货公司河北省公司，大力扶持地方国营工业生产，研究产销情况，为地方国营工业产品打开了销路。
    中国百货公司河北省公司全体干部，自从学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，认识到地方国营工业，在供应人民生活需要方面的重要意义，以及扩大地方国营工业产品的销售是国营商业部门的重要任务后，就积极地和省内山海关水果糖厂、衡水电池厂、唐山纸厂、针织厂等十七个地方国营工业签订了包销合同。在二月中旬，省公司召开了全省的百货商店、供应站业务干部会议，大家着重批判了过去忽视扶植地方工业生产的经营思想。会上并将已包销的十七个地方国营工厂的全年产品计划，按照地区的特点、群众的需要，作了适当的分工，以满足农民需要。
    该公司除了扩大地方国营工业产品的销路外，还调查研究地方国营产品销路情况，把消费者特别是农民喜欢的商品、花色等意见，及时地告诉生产的工厂，并帮助他们改进生产。如现在畅销于河北农村中的物美价廉的“四二”女袜，过去保定市针织厂却是生产得很少，经该公司建议后，保定针织厂扩大了“四二”女袜的产量。这样不仅满足人民需要，并且也为该厂产品打开了销路。　　　　（尚福湘）
