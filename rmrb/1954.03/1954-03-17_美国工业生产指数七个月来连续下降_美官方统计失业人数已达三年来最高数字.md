    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: Signs of economic crisis in the United States are becoming increasingly evident. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced on the 15th that the U.S. industrial production index for February continued to decline by two points. This is the seventh consecutive month of declining production. The February industrial production index released by the Board (with the 1947-49 average as 100) was 123, a decrease of 14 points, or 10.2 percent, from the July index of 137. Compared with the same month last year, it decreased by 11 points, or about 8 percent.
    Similar signs are also evident in trade sales, railway freight volume, and other areas. According to U.S. newspaper reports, retail trade in February decreased by 3 percent compared to January. For the week ending March 6, trade sales decreased by 11 percent compared to the same period last year, and railway freight volume decreased by 13.8 percent. Steel production activity continued to decline, and for the week ending March 6, the steel industry's operating rate was only 68.9 percent, a decrease of 30 percent from last year's level.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: According to materials announced on the 12th by the U.S. official agency, the Bureau of the Census, the number of unemployed people in the United States continued to surge by 584,000 in February, creating a new three-year high of 3,671,000.
    The Bureau's materials indicate that this is the fourth consecutive month of rising unemployment in the United States. From November of last year to February of this year, the number of unemployed people in the United States has increased by more than 2 million. The number of unemployed people in February of this year is more than double that of February of last year. The unemployment situation is most severe in the durable goods manufacturing and mining industries, which occupy a major position in the national economy, especially in the automobile industry, household appliance manufacturing, coal mining industry, and metal industry.
    The rapid and continuous increase in the number of unemployed people has deepened the dissatisfaction of American labor unions and working people whose lives are severely threatened with the U.S. government. They demand immediate measures to protect the lives of workers. In a statement issued by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the government was asked to "stop boosting its own morale" and to "immediately find ways to stop this dangerous trend towards a full-scale economic depression."
    The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, with 300,000 members, launched a petition movement at the end of February demanding guarantees of work and union rights. A New York branch of the union also held a rally at the same time, launching an anti-depression movement and passing a program calling for higher wages, improved social insurance, reduced taxes, and the abolition of the Taft-Hartley Act.
    In dozens of large and small cities in Illinois affected by unemployment, workers' organizations and city councils have held rallies, passing anti-depression plans and demanding assistance for unemployed workers. A branch of the United Automobile Workers of America (CIO) in Melrose Park passed an anti-depression program, emphasizing the possibility of "providing full employment for active peaceful purposes."
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The long-term depression in the U.S. coal mining industry has recently worsened. According to the "Wall Street Journal," citing materials from the National Coal Association, in 1953, U.S. bituminous coal production had already decreased by 3 percent compared to 1952, and by 29 percent compared to the peak in 1947. Since the beginning of this year, production has continued to decline at an "accelerated pace." From January 1st to February 13th, bituminous coal production decreased by about 13 percent compared to the same period last year. In the week ending February 13th, production even fell to the lowest level for the same week since 1938. The "Wall Street Journal" pointed out that, along with the reduction in production, many bituminous coal mines have reduced coal prices. The "Wall Street Journal" admitted that the impact of the depression has forced a large number of miners to "tighten their belts," and they are buying less and less meat and essential household goods.

    美国工业生产指数七个月来连续下降
    美官方统计失业人数已达三年来最高数字
   【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：美国经济危机的迹象愈来愈明显。美国联邦储备局十五日宣布，今年二月份美国工业生产指数又继续下降两点。这是生产继续下降的第七个月了。该局发表的二月份工业生产指数（以一九四七—四九年平均数为一百）为一百二十三，比去年七月份的指数一百三十七，下降了十四点，低百分之十点二。与去年同月比较，下降了十一点，约低百分之八。
    在贸易销售额与铁路货运量及其他方面也有同样的迹象。据美国报纸消息说：今年二月间，零售贸易比一月减少了百分之三。到三月六日为止的一周内，贸易销售额比去年同期减少了百分之十一，铁路货运量减少了百分之十三点八。钢的生产活动继续下降，到三月六日为止的一周内，钢铁工业的开工率只达百分之六十八点九，比去年的水平降低了百分之三十。
   【新华社十六日讯】华盛顿消息：根据美国官方机构国情普查局十二日宣布的材料，美国失业人数二月份继续骤增五十八万四千人，造成三年来新的最高数目——三百六十七万一千人。
    该局的材料表明，这已是美国失业人数接连上升的第四个月份，从去年十一月到今年二月之间，美国的失业人数增加了二百多万人。今年二月份的失业人数比去年二月份多一倍以上。失业情况最严重的是在国民经济中占主要地位的耐用品制造业与采矿工业部门，其中又以汽车工业、家庭用具制造业、采煤工业及金属工业等为甚。
    失业人数的迅速而连续的增加，使美国的工会组织和生活受到严重威胁的劳动人民加深了对美国政府的不满，他们要求立即采取措施来保障工人的生活。美国产业工会联合会发表的一篇声明中，要求政府“不要再为自己壮胆”，而要“立即设法制止这种走向全面经济萧条的危险倾向”。
    拥有三十万会员的联合电气、无线电与机器工人工会在二月底发起一个征集要求保障工作与工会权利的请愿书运动。属于该工会的一个纽约分会在同时期内也举行了集会，发起反萧条的运动，通过了一个要求提高工资、改进社会保险、减低捐税、废除塔夫脱—哈特莱法的纲领。
    在伊利诺斯州数十个受到失业影响的大小城市的工人组织与市议会，都纷纷举行集会，通过反萧条的计划和要求帮助失业工人。在密尔罗斯公园城的产联联合汽车工人工会的一个分会通过了一个反萧条纲领，强调“为了积极的和平目的提供充分就业”的可能。
    据新华社讯：长期萧条的美国煤矿工业最近情况更加恶化。据“华尔街日报”最近引用全国煤矿协会的材料说，在一九五三年，美国烟煤生产已经比一九五二年减少了百分之三，比一九四七年的最高峰减少了百分之二十九。今年以来，生产以“加快的速度”继续减缩。从一月一日至二月十三日，烟煤生产一共比去年同期减少约百分之十三。在二月十三日为止的一周内，生产量甚至下降到一九三八年以来同周的最低水平。“华尔街日报”指出，与削减生产同时，许许多多的烟煤矿场纷纷削减煤价。“华尔街日报”承认，萧条的影响已经迫使大批矿工“勒紧腰带”，他们购买的肉类以及必需的家庭用品愈来愈少。莫斯科航　讯
