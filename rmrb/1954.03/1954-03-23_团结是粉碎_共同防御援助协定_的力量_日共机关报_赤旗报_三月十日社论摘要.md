Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 19th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" published an editorial on March 10th entitled "National Unity is the Power to Crush the US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," stating: The day the Yoshida government signed the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," March 8th, will be etched in the hearts of the angry people as a day of national humiliation for Japan. This agreement will force our homeland to suffer new and more terrible destruction and plunder, and force our people into a state of endless poverty.

The editorial pointed out: The United States and the Yoshida government's attempt to conceal the essence of this agreement with the name "US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" is futile. The whole world already knows that this agreement is a tool for the United States to pursue its policy of world domination. The fact that the Yoshida government is currently intensifying its policy of reviving militarism in the political, military, and economic spheres in order to accept this "assistance" clearly illustrates this point. The editorial said: Japan, which is under the US occupation system, will have the military and colonial rule shackles cruelly tightened due to this agreement. The entire life of the people will be squeezed and used as an instrument of American aggression.

The editorial concluded: The Japanese people must never tolerate the humiliation of the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," which destroys the nation and impoverishes life. The Japanese people, led by the working class, have risen up and launched a struggle. This struggle against US "Mutual Security Act Assistance" will develop into a large-scale national unified struggle of the Japanese people to defend peace, democracy, national independence, and the people's livelihood.

    团结是粉碎“共同防御援助协定”的力量
    ——日共机关报“赤旗报”三月十日社论摘要
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”于三月十日以“国民的团结就是粉碎美日共同防御援助协定的力量”为题发表社论说：吉田政府在美日“共同防御援助协定”上签字的三月八日，将会铭记在愤怒的国民心里，成为日本民族屈辱的日子。这个协定将迫使我们祖国遭受新的更惨的破坏和掠夺，并迫使我们国民陷入无止境的贫困状态。
    社论指出：美国和吉田政府企图以美日“共同防御援助协定”这种名称来掩盖这个协定的本质是徒然的。全世界早已知道，这种协定是美国推行统治世界的政策的工具。目前吉田政府为了接受这种“援助”而在政治、军事和经济上加紧推行复活军国主义的政策，非常清楚地说明了这一点。社论说：处于美国占领制度下的日本，将由于这个协定而更加残酷地加重军事性和殖民地统治的枷锁。国民的整个生活都要遭到压榨，并要充当美国的侵略工具。
    社论最后说：日本人民绝不能忍受这种毁灭民族和使生活极端贫困的美日“共同防御援助协定”的屈辱。以工人阶级为首的日本人民已在奋起展开斗争，这个反对美国“共同安全法援助”的斗争，将成为日本人民保卫和平、民主和民族独立以及人民生活的大规模的国民统一斗争而向前发展。
