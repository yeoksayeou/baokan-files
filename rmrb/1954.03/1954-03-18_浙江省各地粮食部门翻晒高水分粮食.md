Grain departments in various locations in Zhejiang Province are actively turning and sunning high-moisture grain. In many areas of the province, newly stored grain contains excessive moisture, some exceeding safety standards. According to incomplete statistics from Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua and other special districts at the end of January, high-moisture grain accounted for 19.17% of the grain in storage, of which grain with a moisture content of 20% or more accounted for 8.59% of all high-moisture grain. Some areas have already experienced grain spoilage. Based on this situation, all locations are stepping up the work of turning and sunning high-moisture grain. Grain storage cadres in Ningbo Special District proposed a guarantee at the district's grain storage worker conference, stating that they would "not let a sunny day pass, not waste a bamboo mat, and not leave a drying yard empty," and strive to complete the turning and sunning of 11% of the total grain reserves with high moisture content before the end of March. Currently, Shaoxing, Yuyao, Shangyu and other counties have ventilated and sunned some of the high-moisture grain. Large-scale grain turning and sunning work is underway in the province.

    浙江省各地粮食部门翻晒高水分粮食
    浙江省各地粮食部门积极翻晒高水分粮食。该省不少地区新入库的粮食所含水分过高，有些超过了安全标准。据嘉兴、温州、宁波、金华等专区一月底的不完全统计，入库粮食中高水分粮食占百分之十九点一七，其中含水分百分之二十以上的又占全部高水分粮食的百分之八点五九。前些日子，部分地区已经发生粮食霉坏现象。各地根据这种情况，都加紧进行对高水分粮食的翻晒工作。宁波专区粮食保管干部在全区粮食保管员会议上提出保证，要作到“不放过一个晴天，不浪费一张竹席，不空一块晒场”，争取在三月底以前把占存粮总数百分之十一的高水分粮翻晒完毕。目前，绍兴、余姚、上虞等县已将部分高水分粮进行过通风、翻晒。大规模的粮食翻晒工作正在全省紧张进行。
