    First Automobile Works Actively Prepares for Construction
    Construction preparation work at the First Automobile Works is largely complete. This year's construction plan was finalized in mid-February. Each unit is adjusting its workforce according to the overall construction plan. Material preparation work is proceeding intensely. After the annual and first and second quarter material preparation plans were drawn up, orders were placed accordingly. Currently, an average of six to seven thousand tons of materials are being transported to the site daily. Dozens of types of construction equipment that need to be added, such as large excavators, belt conveyors, automatic dump trucks, and bulldozers, are also arriving continuously from domestic and foreign sources. Technicians and workers at the mechanized supply station are actively assembling these newly arrived machines and equipment.
    In order to facilitate large-scale construction, some temporary construction projects are underway. In addition to the water and electricity projects, which began construction in early February, temporary projects for roads, telecommunications, and building construction will all commence in March and must be completed in April, before the majority of the formal projects begin. The assembly plant, which began construction in 1953, started installing steel frames in March. Non-ferrous metal and auxiliary factories have also begun roof panel installation. In addition to the steel frame installation of these three factory buildings, various work areas are intensively carrying out foundation construction design and other preparatory work. Mixing plants, woodworking plants, and reinforced steel prefabrication plants are also producing large quantities of materials needed for the start of construction.
    To improve construction management this year, the factory organized study groups last year to learn construction management experience from Anshan Iron and Steel, and plans to promote the implementation of the work section and foreman system from point to area during construction. Soviet experts personally provided guidance during the various preparatory work before construction and offered many suggestions, which helped greatly.
    In addition, the units responsible for supporting the First Automobile Works, such as Changchun Construction Company, the Electric Power Bureau, and the Waterworks, are also making their greatest efforts to actively prepare for construction.

    第一汽车制造厂积极准备施工
    第一汽车制造厂施工准备工作已大部就绪。今年度施工计划已于二月中旬编订完竣。各单位根据总的施工计划，正在调整劳动力。材料准备工作正在紧张进行。全年的和第一、二季度的备料计划编制好后，已分别进行了订货，现在每天平均有六、七千吨的材料运到现场。施工设备方面需要增加的大型掘土机、皮带运输机、自动倾卸车、推土机等几十种设备也源源从国内和国外运来。机械化供应站的技术人员和工人们正积极地把这些新到的机器设备装配起来。
    为了便于大规模施工而进行的一些暂设工程，除水电工程已在二月上旬开始施工外，道路、电讯、房屋建筑等暂设工程在三月份全部动工，并要在四月份，即在正式工程大部开工前全部完成。一九五三年开工的装配工厂，三月份开始装吊钢架。有色金属、辅助工厂也开始了屋面板装吊，除三个厂房装吊外，各工区正紧张地进行着基础施工设计等准备工作。搅拌厂、木工厂、钢筋预制厂等也正生产着大批开工所需的用料。
    该厂为了改进今年的施工管理，曾于去年组织学习小组，去鞍钢学习了施工管理经验，并准备在施工中由点到面推行工段、工长制。在进行施工前的各项准备工作中，苏联专家亲自指导，并提出了许多建议，帮助很大。
    此外，负责支援第一汽车厂的各单位如长春市建筑公司、电业局、自来水厂等单位也正以最大的努力积极着手进行施工前的各项准备工作。
