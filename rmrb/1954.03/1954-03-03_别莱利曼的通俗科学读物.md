    Bely Perelman's Popular Science Readings
    Gu Junzheng
    Bely Perelman is one of the most popular science writers in the Soviet Union. Several of his works have already been introduced to our country, and I think he will certainly be welcomed by the majority of our readers.
    We know very little about Perelman's life, only that he died during the Soviet Patriotic War, when Leningrad was besieged (1942). His works were introduced more than a decade ago. Fu Qixun once selected and translated a portion of his "Entertaining Geometry" and published it in the "Scientific Amusements" magazine published in Shanghai, and Cui Shangxin once selected and translated a portion of his "Entertaining Physics" and published it in the "Wartime Bi-Monthly for Middle School Students" published in Guilin. However, at that time, it was during the Anti-Japanese War, and these publications were not widely circulated, so not many people knew about him.
    Perelman has written no less than dozens of popular science books similar to "Entertaining Physics." The following five have been translated into Chinese: "Entertaining Algebra," translated by Ding Shoutian and Zhu Meikun; "Entertaining Geometry" (two volumes), translated by Fu Qixun; "Entertaining Physics," translated by Fu Qixun; "Entertaining Astronomy," translated by Teng Diping and Tang Ke (all four books published by China Youth Publishing House); "Applied Mathematics," translated by Yao Hongkui (published by Zhonghua Book Company). Among them, besides "Entertaining Physics," which had an earlier translation by Cui Shangxin (the book was translated as "The Physics of Amusement," published by the original Kaiming Bookstore, now out of print), the rest have only met readers after liberation. As far as I know, his other more famous works include "Entertaining Physics Sequel," "Entertaining Mechanics" (both of which China Youth Publishing House is commissioning translations), "Entertaining Chemistry," "Physics at Every Step," "Do You Understand Physics?" "Interplanetary Travel," and so on.
    Like Ilyin, Perelman is also a versatile and knowledgeable writer. He writes books on various subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy, and these subjects contain the basic scientific knowledge that a well-rounded young person needs to know. He puts a lot of effort and time into writing each book. He collected a very rich amount of material from literature, technology, and everyday life, many of which are not mentioned in ordinary popular science books, and do not need to be mentioned in more specialized books.
    His collection of materials is not only a preparation for writing books, but also a preparation for revising them after they are written. His "Entertaining Physics" has been revised and supplemented every time it is reprinted. When this book was printed in its thirteenth edition, only one-half of the text of the first edition was preserved, and almost none of the illustrations were left. Therefore, he referred to this final revised edition and said: "This book was written over the entire twenty-five years since its birth." This also shows his responsible attitude. Although his excessive revisions often aroused criticism from readers, he firmly believed that he could not abandon his responsibilities. He said: "'Entertaining Physics' is not an artistic creation, but a scientific work, even though it is popular. Its content—physics—is constantly being enriched, even in the most basic materials, so this book must add these materials one after another."
    Although Ilyin and Perelman are both famous popular science writers, their requirements for their works and their writing methods are clearly different.
    Ilyin is a communist propagandist. He believes that since communism is built on the foundation of science, then to complete the construction of communism, we must understand nature and participate in the struggle with nature. Therefore, his works not only use the history of the development of things to explain how mankind understands nature, and use the communist construction of the Soviet Union to explain how mankind uses the laws of nature to transform nature, but also depict a beautiful picture of communism, encouraging readers to arm themselves with science first in order to realize communism. In Ilyin's own words, it is to "recruit brave and strong new soldiers for the great ranks of the working people and scientific workers."
    Perelman is a counselor for those who study basic scientific knowledge. He believes that for a beginner, if he is interested in a subject, he will pay more attention, understand it more easily, and thus be able to delve into it more consciously and tirelessly until he masters this knowledge. Therefore, his works are to lead those who begin to learn science into the scientific garden full of exotic flowers and plants, to make them linger, and to make the new soldiers recruited by Ilyin not only have the determination to learn science, but also have the interest in learning, and consciously cultivate themselves into veterans who are both wise and brave.
    Perelman wrote with this conviction, so his writing is neither writing lectures for students nor giving reports to the masses, but rather like arranging a literary evening. He carefully directed and arranged the valuable materials he had collected, making each material a wonderful program. Therefore, reading his works is like attending a grand literary evening, which makes you more and more energetic, and you can't help but applaud and shout "One more!" This is completely different from the mood of always wanting to doze off when watching a rigid lecture and listening to a lengthy and contentless report.
    What are the reasons why his works can attract a wide readership? I would like to discuss the following characteristics:
    First, he selected many materials that can stimulate the reader's imagination, so that the reader can happily follow him to study and use his brain a lot. Lenin said: "A popular writer will start from the simplest and most familiar materials, use simple discussions or appropriately selected examples to point out the main conclusions of these materials, and push the reader in thought to deeper and deeper questions, thereby leading the reader to in-depth thinking and in-depth learning. A popular writer does not take people who do not think, do not want to think, or cannot think as his object—on the contrary, he wants to make readers with a lower level have a strong desire to use their brains, and help them do this serious and difficult work, guide them, help them take the first step, and teach them to continue moving forward independently." (Quoted from the author's preface to the thirteenth edition of "Entertaining Physics") Perelman not only believed in Lenin's words, but also successfully practiced them. For example, in "Entertaining Physics," he tells us how a watermelon can become a bomb, and how a sieve can hold water; in "Entertaining Geometry," he tells us why the strength of an ant should be said to be greater than that of a human being, and why the wooden barrel for holding wine should be made into a big-bellied shape; in "Entertaining Astronomy," he tells us why there can be at most five Fridays in February, and why the sky on the moon is black, and so on. When readers see such bizarre claims, they will definitely sit down and think about it carefully. If they can't figure it out themselves, they will think along with the author, and this is exactly the task that Lenin requires popular science writers to complete.
    Second, he can flexibly handle his subject matter. Even some unremarkable phenomena can become lively and interesting and captivating through his clever arrangement. For example, the phenomenon of thermal expansion and contraction of objects is something that everyone is very familiar with, but he uses the title "Unpunished Theft" to explain that the electric wires between Moscow and Leningrad are about five hundred meters shorter in winter than in summer, which cannot but arouse the reader's surprise and attention. Another example is the phenomenon of air pressure, which is also something that everyone is familiar with, but he points out that we cannot drink water with our mouths alone, but also need the help of our lungs, which makes readers feel novel and interesting without feeling boring.
    Third, he attracts readers to the realm of literature and art. He often draws material from the works of literary writers such as Nekrasov, Pushkin, Chekhov, Gogol, Tolstoy, Jules Verne (French science fiction writer), Wells, Mark Twain, etc., either as an introduction, or to analyze and discuss, or to point out its mistakes. For example, in order to explain that people cannot walk in a straight line when they cannot distinguish directions, but often circle around a center, he cited the stories of getting lost in Jules Verne's "The Adventures of Hatteras" and Tolstoy's "Master and Worker" as examples, and then gave physiological and geometric explanations. He corrected Swift's mistake in "Gulliver's Travels," saying that Gulliver being hit by an apple falling from an apple tree in the Land of Giants would not only fall to the ground, but would also bring extremely serious disasters. Because, according to the proportion, the apple in the Land of Giants should weigh as much as eighty kilograms, and falling from a tree twelve times higher, its powerful striking force can only be compared with that of a cannonball. Such examples are innumerable in Perelman's works. Some people may not like science, but no one does not like literature and art, so he adopted such materials, which made readers feel extra cordial, like seeing an old friend.
    Fourth, he tries to connect with reality as much as possible, not to talk about science for the sake of science, but to talk about science in order to solve certain real problems. For example, in "Entertaining Physics," he tells us not to face the direction from which the sound comes when looking for crickets, but to distinguish them with our ears to the side; when looking in the mirror, do not point the light at your own image in the mirror, but at your own face. These are all things experienced in daily life. Although the principles are simple, most people ignore these simple principles in real life. His "Entertaining Geometry" does this particularly well. What this book talks about is not geometry in the classroom, but, as the author said, it is to bring geometry "from the walls of the school classroom to the free space, to the woods, to the fields, to the river bank, to the road, so that under the vast sky, without textbooks and function tables, we can do geometric exercises without restraint." Readers who read such books will not only not be infected with the popular diseases of mechanically applying formulas and cramming books, but will also feel that scientific knowledge is by no means an ornament, but a powerful weapon for fighting against nature.
    In general, although Perelman's works are written for people who are new to science, they are not a textbook. Its main purpose is not to give readers systematic new knowledge, but to help readers think more deeply and understand more deeply the knowledge they have already obtained from textbooks and from daily life experience. It introduces many processes of analysis, thinking, and summarizing that must be experienced when solving practical problems. On the one hand, it can help readers raise perceptual knowledge to the stage of rational knowledge, and on the other hand, it can also guide readers to develop the habit of independent thinking, and through thinking, apply the knowledge they have mastered to the practice of work.
    Today, when the people of the whole country are studying the general line of the country's transition period, the revolutionary cadres in factories and mines who lack scientific knowledge realize that in order to do a good job in their posts, they need to study production skills and learn scientific and technological knowledge. However, the study of technical knowledge by revolutionary cadres is different from that of students in schools. Students often have teachers to explain and guide them; however, cadres generally can only rely on personal self-study. When they study a textbook, if they do not understand certain paragraphs of text thoroughly or deeply, it is not easy to continue moving forward. Because a textbook is a systematic knowledge, reading a textbook can only be done step by step, and there is no way to skip levels; even if you persist in learning with your own enthusiasm, the result is easy to create the problem of memorizing dogma and indigestion, and you cannot apply it flexibly when you encounter practical problems. In view of this situation, I think that every revolutionary cadre who hopes to study science on their own, in addition to selecting a formal textbook, is also worth reading Perelman's works.

    别莱利曼的通俗科学读物
    顾均正
    别莱利曼是苏联最受读者欢迎的通俗科学读物作家之一。他的作品已经有好几种介绍到我国来了，我想他一定也会受到我国广大读者的欢迎。
    别莱利曼的生平我们知道得很少，只知道他是在苏联卫国战争中，正当列宁格勒被围的时候（一九四二年）逝世的。他的作品在十多年前就已有人介绍过。符其珣曾经选译他的“趣味几何学”中的一部分发表在上海出版的“科学趣味”杂志上，崔尚辛曾经选译他的“趣味物理学”中的一部分发表在桂林出版的“中学生战时半月刊”上。不过那时候正值抗日战争时期，这些刊物传布得还不甚广，因此知道他的人并不多。
    别莱利曼所写跟“趣味物理学”相类的通俗科学读物不下几十种，现在已经译成中文的有下列五种：“趣味代数学”，丁寿田、朱美琨译；“趣味几何学”（上下两册），符其珣译；“趣味物理学”，符其珣译；“趣味天文学”，滕砥平、唐克译
  （以上四书都由中国青年出版社出版）；“活用的数学”，姚宏奎译（中华书局出版）。其中除了“趣味物理学”很早就有崔尚辛的译本（书名译为“趣味的物理学”，由原开明书店出版，现已绝版。）外，其余都是在解放以后才和读者见面的。他的其它较著名的作品，据我所知，还有“趣味物理学续编”“趣味力学”（以上两书中国青年出版社已在约人翻译中）“趣味化学”“每一步的物理学”“你懂得物理学吗？”“行星间的旅行”等等。
    跟伊林一样，别莱利曼也是一个博学多能的作家，他写的书有数学、物理学、化学、天文学等各种科目，而这些科目所包含的正是一个全面发展的青年所必需知道的基础的科学知识。他每写一种书都是花去极大的精力和时间的。他从文学、技术和日常生活等各个方面搜集了非常丰富的材料，其中有许多问题在普通通俗科学书里是不会讲到的，而在比较专门的书里又是不需要讲到的。
    他的搜集材料不但作为写书以前的准备工作，而且也作为写成以后进行修订的准备工作。他的“趣味物理学”在每次重版的时候都有改动和增补，在这本书印刷到第十三版的时候，文字只保存了初版的二分之一，插图几乎一幅也没有留存了。所以他指这个最后的改订版说：“这部书是在它问世以来二十五年的全部岁月里写成的。”这也见得他的负责态度。虽然他的过多的改动也时常引起读者的责难，但是他坚决地认为他不能放弃他应负的责任。他说：“‘趣味物理学’不是艺术创作，而是科学著作，虽说它是通俗的。它的内容——物理学——即使在最基本的材料上也不停地有新鲜的材料在充实，在丰富，因此这部书也一定得把这些材料陆续添加进去。”
    伊林跟别莱利曼虽然同是著名的通俗科学读物作家，可是他们对于自己的作品所要达到的要求和写作的方法却显然不同。
    伊林是共产主义的宣传员。他认为既然共产主义是在科学的基础上建立起来的，那末我们要完成共产主义的建设，就得认识自然，并参加和自然的斗争。因此他的作品不但用事物发展的历史来说明人类怎样认识自然，用苏联的共产主义建设来说明人类怎样利用自然法则来改造自然，并且还描写出一幅共产主义的美丽图景，鼓舞着读者为实现共产主义而首先用科学来武装自己。用伊林自己的话来说，就是要“替劳动人民和科学工作者的伟大队伍招募来勇敢的坚强的新战士”。
    别莱利曼是学习基础科学知识者的辅导员。他认为就一个初学者来说，如果对于一门学科发生兴趣，就会加倍注意，也容易理解，从而能够更自觉地去深入领会，不倦地钻研下去，直到掌握这些知识。因此他的作品是要把开始学习科学的人引到开满着奇花异草的科学园地之中，叫他们流连忘返，是要使伊林招募来的新战士不但对科学有学习的决心，而且有学习的兴趣，自觉地培养成为智勇双全的老战士。
    别莱利曼怀着这样的信念，所以他的写作既不是给学生写讲义，也不是给群众作报告，倒好像是在布置一个文艺晚会。他把搜集来的珍贵的材料精心地加以编导，使每一材料成为一个精彩的节目。因此你读他的作品就像参加一个盛大的文艺晚会，使你越看越有劲，不由自主地鼓着掌喊“再来一个！”这跟看死板的讲义和听冗长而没有内容的报告的那种老是想瞌睡的心情是完全不同的。
    他的作品所以能吸引广大的读者，理由何在呢？我想可以提出下列几个特点来谈谈：
    第一，他选择了许多能够激发读者的想像力的材料，使读者高高兴兴地跟着他去钻研，去大动脑筋。列宁说过：“通俗作家会从最简单的大家都熟悉的材料出发，利用简单的讨论或者用适当选择过的例子指出这些材料的主要结论，把在思考中的读者推动到一步深入一步的问题上去，从而把读者带引到深入的思维、深入的学习中。通俗作家不是以不思想的人、不愿思想或不会思想的人做对象，——相反，他要使水平比较低的读者具有强烈的意愿去运用头脑，并帮助他们做这件严重而困难的工作，引导他们，帮助他们走出第一步，并且教导他们，使他们独立地继续迈进。”（转引自“趣味物理学”第十三版著者序言摘要）别莱利曼不但信服列宁这几句话，而且也成功地实践了这几句话。例如在“趣味物理学”里，他告诉我们西瓜怎样会变成炸弹，筛子怎样可以盛水；在“趣味几何学”里，他告诉我们蚂蚁的力气为什么应该说比人的力气大，盛酒的木桶为什么要造成大肚子的形状；在“趣味天文学”里，他告诉我们为什么二月里最多可以有五个星期五，为什么月球上的天空是黑色的等等。读者看到了这样的奇谈怪论，一定要坐下来定心想一想，自己想不出，就会跟着作者一同去想，而这正是列宁要求通俗科学读物作家应该完成的任务。
    第二，他能够灵活地处理他的题材，即使是一些平淡无奇的现象，经他巧妙地安排，也能够变得生动有趣，引人入胜。例如物体热胀冷缩的现象原是大家十分熟悉的事，可是他以“不受处罚的盗窃”为题来说明莫斯科和列宁格勒之间的电线冬天大约要比夏天短五百公尺，这就不能不引起读者的惊异而加以注意了。又如空气压力这个现象也是大家熟悉的事，可是他提出我们喝水的时候不可能光用嘴来喝，还得用肺来帮忙，这就让读者觉得新奇有趣而不觉得枯燥了。
    第三，他把读者吸引到文艺的领域中。他常常从文艺作家像涅克拉索夫、普希金、契诃夫、果戈里、托尔斯泰、于尔·维恩（法国科学幻想小说作家）、威尔斯、马克·吐温等人的作品中汲取题材，或是把它作为引子，或是加以分析讨论，或是指出它的错误所在。例如他为了要说明人在不辨方向的时候不可能走直线的路，往往要绕着一个中心打圈圈的道理，就引用了于尔·维恩的“哈特拉斯冒险记”和托尔斯泰的“主人和工人”中迷路的故事作例子，然后再加以生理学的和几何学的解释。他纠正了施威夫脱在“大人国游记”里的错误，说葛利佛给大人国里苹果树上掉下来的苹果所击中，将不仅是跌倒在地上，而且一定要带来极严重的灾难。因为按比例计算，大人国的苹果应该重达八十公斤，而且从十二倍高的树上掉下，它的强大的打击力量只能拿炮弹来跟它相比。像这样的例子，在别莱利曼的作品中是不胜列举的。可能有人不喜欢科学，但是没有一个人不爱好文艺，所以他采用了这样的题材，就使读者分外感到亲切，像见到老朋友一样。
    第四，他尽可能联系实际，不是为了科学而讲科学，却是为了解决某一些现实问题而讲科学。例如他在“趣味物理学”里告诉我们找蟋蟀不要把面孔对着声音传来的地方，要侧着耳朵去辨别；照镜子不要把灯光对着镜子里自己的像，要对着自己的脸。这些都是从日常生活中体验出来的东西。道理虽然简单，可是大多数人在实际生活中都忽略了这些简单的道理。他所写的“趣味几何学”对这一点做得特别出色。这部书所讲的并不是教室中的几何学，而是像作者所说的，是把几何学“从学校教室的围墙中引到自由空间，到树林里，到原野上，到河边，到路上，以便在辽阔的天空下面，不用教科书和函数表，无拘无束地来做几何作业”。读者读了这样的书，不但不会染上硬套公式和死啃书本的流行病，而且将感到科学知识决不是一种装饰品，而是跟大自然斗争的有力武器。
    总的说来，别莱利曼的作品虽然是给初学科学的人写的，但并不是一种教科书。它的主要目的不是在给读者以系统的新知识，而是在帮助读者把他从教科书中和从日常生活经验中所已经得到的知识作更深入的思索和更深入的领会。它介绍了许多解决实际问题时所必须经历的分析、思索和总结的过程，这一方面可以帮助读者把感性认识提高到理性认识的阶段，一方面也可以引导读者养成独立思考的习惯，并通过思考，把已经掌握的知识运用到工作的实践中去。
    在全国人民都在学习国家过渡时期总路线的今天，厂矿企业中缺乏科学知识的革命干部，都认识到要搞好岗位工作，就需要钻研生产业务、学习科学技术知识。然而革命干部的学习技术知识究竟和学校中的学生有所不同。学生经常有教师在讲解指导；但是干部一般都只能靠个人自学。当他们研读一本教科书的时候，要是对于书中某几段文字领会得不透，理解得不深，就不容易继续前进。因为教科书是一种系统知识，读教科书是只能循序渐进，没有办法躐等的；即使凭着你自己的一片热忱，坚持学习下去，结果也容易造成死背教条、食而不化的毛病，碰到实际问题，就不能灵活应用了。针对这一情况，我想每个希望自学科学的革命干部，除了选定正式的教科书外，还值得读一读别莱利曼的作品。
