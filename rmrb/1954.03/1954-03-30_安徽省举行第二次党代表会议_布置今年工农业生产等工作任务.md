The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China in Anhui Province was held from February 9th to a victorious conclusion on March 12th.

The Anhui Provincial Party Congress, on the basis of further studying the General Line, summarized the work of 1953 and deployed the tasks for 1954. According to the "Report on the Summary of Work in 1953 and Work Tasks for 1954" made by Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee on behalf of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, and the resolutions of the congress, a new outlook was presented for the work of Anhui Province. Anhui Province has an agricultural area with a population of over 20 million, most of which is in natural conditions that are prone to drought and flooding. In order to lead the province's farmers to achieve a 10% increase in grain production this year, an approximately 40% increase in oil crops compared to last year, a 10% increase in tea production, and increased production of other crops, the Party organization has put forward enormous tasks. In addition to vigorously carrying out fertilizer accumulation and strengthening leadership over production technology throughout the province, in the Huai River area, the Party organization is required to strengthen leadership over the reform of agricultural production and complete the task of converting nearly one million mu to drought-resistant and flood-resistant crops such as rice, potatoes, and sweet potatoes; in mountainous areas, terraced fields should be gradually established; in terms of farmland water conservancy, the Party Congress emphasized the development of small-scale farmland water conservancy, with the earthwork for small-scale water conservancy projects this spring reaching more than 54 million cubic meters, and striving to build and excavate more than 250,000 ponds and dams throughout the year. These will create favorable conditions for increased production.

In order to actively carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, the Party Congress criticized the phenomenon in the province's past leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement where it blindly opposed hasty and rash advances without considering local conditions, causing the movement to fall into spontaneity. The meeting formulated a plan for developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations this year, requiring more than 2,500 agricultural production cooperatives to be well-run this spring, and absorbing 65% of farmers into mutual aid groups throughout the year. Supply and marketing and credit cooperative organizations should also be developed accordingly.

In terms of industrial production, the Party Congress analyzed the specific situation in Anhui Province. Apart from state-owned factories and mines, the foundation of local state-owned industry is very weak. Due to the needs of production and people's lives, it is required that local resources must be fully utilized to develop local industry accordingly in the future. The Party Congress decided that Anhui Province will develop more than 20 local state-owned factories this year, increasing the total output value of local state-owned industry by 30% compared to last year. At the meeting, erroneous ideas such as some cadres being unwilling to work in small factories, believing that the original local factories were "a mess," and "prone to accidents and difficult to complete tasks" were criticized, making the cadres realize the importance of fully exploiting the potential of existing enterprises.

Regarding the transformation of private industry and commerce, the congress analyzed the situation in Anhui Province where there is little industry and backward technology. Among the approximately 190,000 private industrial and commercial households in Anhui Province, merchants with fixed locations and hawkers account for 140,000 households. These make the transformation task more difficult and complex. Therefore, the congress emphasized that work must be carried out strictly according to plan, and arduous and meticulous education should be carried out to prevent disconnections in social and economic life from occurring during the transformation process.

While deploying various tasks, the Party Congress closely combined them with the meetings held by various business departments, so that the Party's guiding ideology was centrally and uniformly implemented in various business departments. For example, the Party's propaganda work conference comprehensively deployed a large-scale campaign to once again publicize the General Line throughout the province according to the requirements of the Party Congress. The spirit and requirements of the congress were also implemented in the industrial, educational, water conservancy and other business departments' meetings held during this period, and the work of their respective departments was deployed.

### 安徽省举行第二次党代表会议  布置今年工农业生产等工作任务

    安徽省举行第二次党代表会议
    布置今年工农业生产等工作任务
    中国共产党安徽省第二次代表会议从二月九日开幕到三月十二日胜利闭幕。
    安徽省党代表会议在进一步学习总路线的基础上总结了一九五三年的工作，布置了一九五四年的任务。根据中共安徽省委书记曾希圣代表安徽省委所作的“一九五三年工作总结及一九五四年工作任务的报告”和大会的决议，给安徽省的工作展现了一个新的面貌。安徽省有两千多万人口的农业区，在这些农业区中，大部分是处于易旱易涝的自然条件下，党的组织为了领导全省农民实现今年粮食增产百分之十，油料作物比去年增产百分之四十左右，茶叶增产一成，以及其他作物的增产任务，提出了巨大的工作。全省除了大力开展积肥和加强对生产技术的领导外，在淮河地区要求党的组织加强对农业生产改革的领导工作，完成近百万亩改种水稻、马铃薯和红芋等抗旱抗涝作物的任务；在山岭地带逐步兴办台田、梯田；在农田水利方面，党代表会议强调了开展小型农田水利的工作，今春小型水利的土方工程即达五千四百多万公方，全年争取修挖塘坝二十五万多口。这些都将给增产创造有利的条件。
    党代表会议为积极进行对农业的社会主义改造工作，批判了该省过去在领导互助合作运动中，不根据当地情况盲目地反对急躁冒进思想，使运动陷于自流的现象。会议制订了今年发展互助合作组织的计划，要求今年春季办好两千五百多个农业生产合作社，在全年吸收百分之六十五的农户参加互助组，供销和信用合作组织也予以相应的发展。
    在工业生产方面，党代表会议分析了安徽省的具体情况，除去国营厂矿以外，地方国营工业的基础十分薄弱，由于生产和人民生活的需要，要求今后必须充分利用当地资源去相应地发展地方工业。党代表会议决定今年安徽省将发展二十多个地方国营工厂，使地方国营工业的总产值比去年增产百分之三十。会议上批判了部分干部不愿到小厂里工作，认为原有的地方工厂都是些“烂摊子”，“容易出事故，不容易完成任务”等错误思想，使干部认识了充分发挥原有企业潜力的重要意义。
    对私营工商业的改造问题，代表会议分析了安徽省工业少，技术落后的情况。安徽省在约十九万户的私营工商业中，座商行商和摊贩就占十四万户。这些都使改造的任务更加艰巨和复杂，因此代表会议强调必须严格地按计划进行工作，并应进行艰苦细致的教育，防止在改造过程中发生社会经济生活的脱节现象。
    党代表会议在布置各项工作的同时，紧密地结合了各个业务部门所召开的会议，使党的领导思想集中统一地贯彻到各个业务部门。如党的宣传工作会议就根据党代表会议的要求，全面地部署了在全省范围内再进行一次大规模的宣传总路线的工作。在这个期间所召开的工业、教育、水利等其他业务部门的会议，也都贯彻了代表会议的精神和要求，布置了本部门的工作。　（新华社）
