Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 4th: The Vietnam Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial in this issue titled "The Decision to Convene the Geneva Conference is a Major Step Forward in Easing International Tensions."

The editorial stated: The agreement reached by the four foreign ministers is a significant achievement for the world peace and democracy camp in easing international tensions. This shows that major international disputes, particularly unresolved issues in the Far East, cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. If the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina—these two extremely important international issues—can be resolved through peaceful negotiations, it will undoubtedly help ease international tensions.

The editorial pointed out that the reason for forcing French and American imperialists to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference is primarily due to: the increasingly strong determination of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to strive for national independence, who have risen up and waged armed struggles in the past seven or eight years and have achieved brilliant successes. Conversely, French colonialists and American interventionists have suffered heavy defeats. In particular, French colonialists are now in a precarious situation. France's military and financial resources have been strained due to the war of aggression in Vietnam. The facts in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos prove that no matter how cruel and malicious the imperialists are, they cannot conquer a nation that is determined to rise up and defend its national independence.

The just war of resistance of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos has received the support and encouragement of all progressive humanity. Conversely, French colonialists and American interventionists, who are waging a war of aggression in Indochina, have been condemned by peace-loving people all over the world, especially the French people.

The editorial pointed out: However, imperialists, especially the American reactionaries, immediately after the four foreign ministers issued the communiqué on convening the Geneva Conference, began to try to make the conference a failure. They have already begun to spread such pessimistic sentiments, saying that the conference has little hope of success. The reason why they are trying their best to obstruct the Geneva Conference is to continue and expand the war of aggression in Indochina and maintain international tensions.

The editorial stated: The Vietnamese people are fighting for national independence and peace. President Ho Chi Minh's answer to the editor of the Swedish "Expressen" on November 26, 1953, and his message on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the National War of Resistance against France in December 1953, clearly explained the views of the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on national independence and peace.

The Vietnamese people support the agreement to convene the Geneva Conference, but maintain a high degree of vigilance against the sabotage conspiracies of American and French imperialists. American and French imperialists pay lip service to peace, but in fact, they are doing everything possible to continue this dirty war. French High Commissioner in Indochina Dejean said on February 19 that it is impossible to start negotiations now, and the best way is to intensify military operations. French generals and the Minister of Defense are secretly discussing with their American masters how to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The U.S. government recently sent more air force personnel to help the French colonialists in Indochina and is planning to send a U.S. military delegation to Vietnam to directly command the war of aggression. They are also plotting to throw the puppet Syngman Rhee's troops into the war.

The editorial concluded: All this proves that imperialists insist on implementing their policy of aggression. The Vietnamese people clearly know that the struggle for the true independence and peace of Vietnam is a long-term and arduous struggle. The Vietnamese people also know that Vietnam can only achieve national independence when the Vietnamese people can make the French and American imperialists learn a lesson from the facts and understand that they cannot achieve their aggressive plans by using force.

### 越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论称  召开日内瓦会议有助于缓和国际紧张局势

    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论称
    召开日内瓦会议有助于缓和国际紧张局势
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社北越四日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”这一期发表一篇社论，题目是“召开日内瓦会议的决议是向着缓和国际紧张局势前进了一大步”。
    社论说：四国外长达成的协议，是世界和平民主阵营在缓和国际紧张局势方面的一个重大成就。这说明：没有中华人民共和国参加，是不能解决重大的国际争端，特别是远东的悬而未决的问题的。如果朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题——这两个极为重要的国际问题能够经过和平谈判得到解决，无疑将有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    社论指出迫使法、美帝国主义者要在日内瓦会议上讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的原因，首先是由于：争取民族独立的决心日益加强的越南、高棉和寮国人民，在过去七八年中奋起进行了武装斗争，并取得了辉煌的成就。相反地，法国殖民者和美国干涉者却遭到了惨重的失败。尤其是法国殖民者现在已处于危急的境地。由于在越南进行侵略战争，法国的兵力和财政都感到窘迫了。越南、高棉和寮国的事实证明，不论帝国主义者多么残酷，多么恶毒，他们无法征服一个坚决奋起保卫自己民族独立的民族。
    越南、高棉和寮国人民的正义的抗战，已经获得了所有进步人类的支持和鼓励。相反地，在印度支那进行侵略战争的法国殖民者和美国干涉者，受到世界各地的爱好和平的人民，尤其是法国人民的谴责。
    社论指出：但是，帝国主义者，尤其是美国反动派在四国外长发表了召开日内瓦会议的公报以后，立刻就在设法要使会议开不好。他们已经开始在散布这样的悲观空气，说会议很少成功希望。他们所以尽力想阻挠日内瓦会议，是为了想继续进行并扩大印度支那的侵略战争，维持国际紧张局势。
    社论说：越南人民正在为争取民族独立与和平而斗争。胡志明主席一九五三年十一月二十六日答瑞典“快报”主编问，以及他在一九五三年十二月越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕，发表的文告，明晰地说明了越南民主共和国的人民和政府对于民族独立与和平的看法。
    越南人民支持召开日内瓦会议的协议，但是对于美、法帝国主义者的破坏阴谋一直保持着很高的警惕。美、法帝国主义者口里空谈和平，实际上却千方百计地要把这场肮脏的战争进行下去。法国驻印度支那高级专员德让二月十九日说，现在要开始谈判是不可能的，最好的办法是加紧军事行动。法国的将领们和国防部长正秘密地和他们的美国主子讨论怎样扩大越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争。美国政府最近派遣了更多的空军人员来帮助印度支那的法国殖民者，而且正计划派遣一个美国军事代表团到越南来直接指挥侵略战争。他们还阴谋把傀儡李承晚的军队投入战争。
    社论最后说：所有这些证明，帝国主义者坚持执行他们的侵略政策。越南人民清楚地知道，争取越南真正独立与和平的斗争是一个长期的、艰巨的斗争。越南人民也知道，只有当越南人民得以使法、美帝国主义者从事实中取得教训明白他们使用武力也是不能实现他们的侵略计划的时候，越南才能获得民族独立。
