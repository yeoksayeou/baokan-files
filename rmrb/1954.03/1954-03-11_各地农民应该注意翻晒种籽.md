Reader's Letters in Brief:

    Farmers in All Regions Should Pay Attention to Turning and Drying Seeds
    Lin Xiangzi from Pukou, Hongshanqiao, Fuzhou, Fujian writes: During the spring plowing last year, the Thirteen District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Minhou County lent seeds to farmers in Jianping, Rongqiao and other villages. Because the cooperative did not properly store the seeds, some of them went bad, and the resulting seedlings could not be used for transplanting. Now that spring plowing is approaching, I suggest that supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers in all regions carefully check the stored seeds and turn and dry them to ensure that good seedlings grow from the seeds after planting, and that more grain is produced.

    各地农民应该注意翻晒种籽
    福建福州市洪山桥浦口林祥梓来信：闽侯县十三区供销合作社在去年春耕时，曾向建平、榕桥等乡农民贷放种籽。由于该社对种籽保管不好，有一部分种籽已经坏了，结果长出的秧苗不能用来插秧。现在春耕生产就要到来，我建议各地供销合作社、农业生产合作社、互助组和广大农民，要认真地检查一下储存的种籽，并加以翻晒，以保证种籽种出后长出好的秧苗，增产更多的粮食。
