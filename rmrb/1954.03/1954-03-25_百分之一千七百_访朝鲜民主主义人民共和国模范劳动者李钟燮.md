One Thousand Seven Hundred Percent

--Visiting Li Zhongxie, a Model Worker of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Liu Ye

    A touching story happened on December 12, 1952.

    In the tunnels of the Guisheng Mine in Korea, the heavy rock drill emitted a rumbling sound. A robust worker stood tall in front of the rock, more stern and tenacious than the rock itself. His strong and powerful hands gripped the rock drill tightly, his bright eyes focused intently on the hole being drilled. The intense vibrations shook his entire body. "Every extra piece of ore mined adds a bit more strength to the front lines!" he thought, as if he were wielding not a rock drill, but an automatic rifle or a machine gun. The drill bit swiftly penetrated the ore inch by inch, one, two... Honeycomb-like, regularly spaced holes appeared on the rock face. Then, he loaded the explosives, lit the fuse, gave the safety signal, and with a deafening blast, a huge amount of ore tumbled down. Immediately afterwards, a new round of drilling began.

    "One thousand seven hundred and forty-three percent!"

    This worker, exceeding his daily production quota by 1,743 percent, set a national record for the highest ore production. The news spread throughout the entire mine and across the northern half of Korea. "Learn from advanced producers!" A fervent production competition swept through all the mines. Thus, with countless selfless efforts, he created enormous wealth for his country, and was successively awarded the glorious Labor Medal and the First Class National Flag Medal.

    This advanced producer is Li Zhongxie, a member of the Korean People's Delegation visiting China and a member of the Labor Party. He humbly recounted his exemplary deeds on the labor front to me.

    Li Zhongxie's life journey unfolded as follows: He was born into a poor farming family in Xiongtan Township, Yichuan County, Jiangyuan Province. At the age of fourteen, he began life as a miner, drifting from one mine to another, enduring the cruel oppression and enslavement of the Japanese invaders. Only after the "August 15th" liberation did Li Zhongxie truly become the master of his life. He dedicated all his wisdom and strength to working happily in the mines, creating a peaceful and happy life for the people of his country.

    On June 25, 1950, the sound of American imperialist aggression against Korea echoed. This sound shook the Korean people, who were working peacefully. Li Zhongxie immediately realized that his post was on the front lines. Like many workers, he requested to join the People's Army. However, his request was not approved; equally important work awaited him. Li Zhongxie was transferred to the Guisheng Mine to undertake the significant task of supporting the front lines. Thus, he appeared on the rear area mines in a combat-ready posture.

    Although Li Zhongxie had been a miner for over a decade, the rock drilling technique was unfamiliar to him. "For the victory of the war, difficulties must be overcome!" The thought of the needs of the front lines filled him with confidence, courage, and strength. With the help of the Party, administration, and fellow workers in the mine, he quickly mastered the rock drilling technique. In 1951, his first year as a rock drill operator, he exceeded his annual production plan by 145 percent, developing himself into an advanced technical worker. Li Zhongxie was not satisfied with this achievement. He clearly knew that his country needed him to extract even more ore. He painstakingly studied how to improve backward working methods and leverage the potential of machinery under conditions of labor shortage and insufficient equipment. To this end, he forgot about rest; during many sleepless nights, he racked his brains, thinking, drawing, and calculating. At the beginning of 1952, he attended the National Congress of Industrial Workers' Activists and absorbed the working methods of many advanced workers. In particular, the work experience of Republic Hero Zhao Doushi, a rock drill operator, greatly inspired him. Based on the specific conditions of his mine and according to the rock quality, he expanded the hole spacing to 150 centimeters and implemented a "stage parallel blasting method," which greatly improved mining efficiency compared to the past. In the first quarter of 1952, using this advanced working method, production increased by more than double. Subsequently, one new record after another, the production quota was raised, but Li Zhongxie's mining record always stayed ahead of the production quota. Finally, an astonishing record appeared: Li Zhongxie set a national record by increasing his daily production quota by seventeen times. In 1952, with the production quota constantly increasing, he exceeded his annual production plan by 287 percent and saved the country explosives and other materials worth more than 150,000 yuan (Korean currency).

    Li Zhongxie's exemplary actions became a model for rock drill operators in the mine to learn from. Li Zhongxie actively helped other workers master advanced rock drilling techniques, enabling Guisheng Mine to achieve excellent production results. In 1951, each rock drill could only extract an average of 6.6 tons of ore per day, but after implementing the new mining method, it increased to 20 tons in 1952, and then to 32 tons in 1953, exceeding the original quota by 485 percent. These creative labors provided a strong material basis for the victory of the Korean War, just as Li Zhongxie thought, "Every piece of ore is a force to eliminate the enemy."

    Li Zhongxie and other workers, in the process of creating the above achievements, encountered countless difficulties. One day in late June 1952, Li Zhongxie was wrestling with the rocks when suddenly the rock drill in his hand stopped spinning, and the tunnel fell silent. What was going on? It turned out that on this day, the American bandits barbarously bombed the Shuifeng Power Plant on the Yalu River with more than fifty "B-29" heavy bombers, and the mine was without power. Machines without electricity are like people without blood. However, the Korean working class did not bow their heads in the face of this difficulty. Li Zhongxie put forward the battle cry of "Not a minute of production can be stopped!" and many workers responded. During the two-month power outage, they mobilized all their forces, using human power instead of machines, ensuring the completion of the production task. In 1952, although they encountered this major difficulty, they completed the annual production plan 75 days ahead of schedule. This was their powerful counterattack against the enemy's destruction.

    The Korean War stopped. Li Zhongxie, with infinite enthusiasm and hope, threw himself into the reconstruction of his country. He was constantly thinking about how to create a happy life from the ruins with greater production achievements. One-third of the workers and technicians in the Guisheng Mine went to the glorious posts of capital construction, and those who remained needed to undertake more production tasks. Li Zhongxie realized that they must make one person do the work of two people in order to complete the production task, but this could not be solved by increasing labor intensity. The only way was to let everyone quickly learn science and technology and master advanced mining methods. Therefore, he actively imparted his working methods and experience to new rock drilling workers. He spent two or three hours every day lecturing other workers on technology, discussing and studying how to improve work together, and demonstrating advanced mining methods to them. In this way, he trained more than a dozen skilled workers in the half-year after the armistice, and under his help, many labor innovators emerged in the mine. Li Zhongxie regarded helping other workers as his glorious task. He is now studying a newer working method. He said: "I want to make the rock drill move faster and make the country's construction recover faster." Thus, before leaving the mine to visit China, he completed the production plan for the first quarter of 1954 by more than one-third in less than a month and a half.

    I listened to Li Zhongxie's account with admiration. From him, I saw the heroic spirit of the hardworking, simple, and brave Korean working class in selfless labor during the war and recovery period, and I saw the happy and beautiful future of this heroic country. I shook Li Zhongxie's hand and said goodbye to him. Ah, his strong and powerful hands! How much valuable labor has been given to the country, and how much strong force is contained to build a happy tomorrow for the country!

    百分之一千七百
    ——访朝鲜民主主义人民共和国模范劳动者李钟燮
    刘野
    一件动人的事情，发生在一九五二年十二月十二日。
    在朝鲜桂生矿山的坑道里，笨重的凿岩机发出隆隆转动的声音。一位身材健壮的工人，巍然站立在岩石跟前，他比岩石更严峻、更顽强。他的坚实有力的双手紧握着凿岩机，炯炯的目光全神贯注地盯着被凿开的孔眼，激烈的震动摇动着全身。“多采一块矿石，就为前线多增加一分力量！”他这样想着，好像手里操纵着的不是凿岩机，而是自动枪或机关枪。凿头飞快地向着矿石一寸一寸地钻进去，一个，两个……岩壁上出现了蜂窝似的有规格的窟窿。然后，装好炸药，点燃导火线，发出安全信号，随着震耳的爆破声，巨大的矿石倒下来。紧接着，下一次新的凿岩工作又开始了。
    “百分之一千七百四十三！”
    这位工人，以百分之一千七百四十三超额完成日产计划，创造了全国空前的最高采矿纪录。这消息传遍了整个矿山，也传遍了北半个朝鲜。“向先进生产者学习！”在所有的矿山，一个热火朝天的增产竞赛掀动起来了。就这样，他以无数次忘我的劳动，为祖国创造着巨大的财富，先后获得了光荣的劳动勋章和一级国旗勋章。
    这位先进生产者就是朝鲜人民访华代表团团员、劳动党员李钟燮。他向我谦虚地叙述了他在劳动战线上的模范事迹。
            ×××
    李钟燮的生活道路是这样走过来的：他生在江原道伊川郡熊滩面一个穷困的农民家里。十四岁就开始了矿工生活，从这个矿山，流落到那个矿山，受尽了日寇的残酷压迫和奴役。“八·一五”解放后，李钟燮才真正成了生活的主人，他把自己的全部智慧和力量贡献出来，愉快地劳动在矿山上，为祖国人民创造着和平幸福的生活。
    一九五○年六月二十五日，美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的炮声响了。这炮声，震动了正在和平中劳动的朝鲜人民。李钟燮马上认识到自己的岗位在前线，他和许多工人一样，要求参加人民军。但是，他的要求没有被批准，同样重要的工作在等待着他。李钟燮被调到桂生矿山担负起了支援前线的重大任务。于是，他以战斗的姿态在后方矿山上出现了。
    虽然李钟燮当了十几年的矿工，但凿岩技术对于他却是生疏的。“为了战争的胜利，必须克服困难！”他心里一想到前线的需要，浑身就充满了信心、勇气和力量。他在矿山的党、行政和工人同志们的帮助下，迅速掌握了凿岩技术。一九五一年，这是他当凿岩工的第一年，就以百分之一百四十五的成绩超额完成了全年生产计划，把自己锻炼成一个先进的技术工人。这样的成绩，李钟燮丝毫也不感到满足。他清楚地知道，祖国需要他采掘更多的矿石。他苦心钻研着如何在劳动力缺乏，机器设备不足的条件下，改进落后的工作方法，发挥机器的潜在能力。为了这个，他忘记了休息，在多少个不眠的夜里，他绞尽脑汁，想着，画着，计算着。一九五二年年初，他参加了全国产业工人积极分子大会，吸收了许多先进工人的工作方法。特别是共和国英雄、凿岩工赵斗实的工作经验，给他很大的启发。他根据自己矿山的具体情况，按照岩质，把孔间扩大成一百五十公分，实行了“阶段平行爆破法”，较以前大大提高了采矿效率。在一九五二年采用这种先进工作法的第一个季度里，生产量就提高到一倍以上。接着，一个新纪录又一个新纪录，生产定额提高了，但李钟燮的采矿纪录总是跑在生产定额的前面。终于惊人的纪录出现了，李钟燮创造了日产定额提高到十七倍的全国最高纪录。一九五二年，在生产定额不断提高的情况下，他以百分之二百八十七超额完成了全年生产计划，并且为国家节省了价值十五万余元（朝鲜币）的炸药等物资。
    李钟燮的这种模范行动，成为矿山凿岩工人学习的榜样。李钟燮积极地帮助其他工人掌握先进的凿岩技术，使桂生矿山的生产获得了优越的成绩。一九五一年每台凿岩机平均一天只能采掘六点六吨矿石，但在实行了新的采矿法以后，一九五二年就提高到二十吨，到了一九五三年又提高到三十二吨，比原定额提高了百分之四百八十五。这些创造性的劳动，为朝鲜战争的胜利提供了有力的物质基础，正如李钟燮所想的一样，“每一块矿石，都是消灭敌人的力量。”
    李钟燮和其他的工人一起，在创造上述成绩的过程中，遭遇的困难是说不尽的。一九五二年六月下旬的一天，李钟燮正在和岩石搏斗着，突然手里的凿岩机停止了转动，坑道里顿时沉寂下来。这是怎么回事呢？原来，这一天美国强盗以五十余架“B—二十九”型的重轰炸机，残暴地炸毁了鸭绿江上的水丰发电厂，矿山停电了。机器少了电力，就如同人失去了血液一样。但是，朝鲜的工人阶级没有在这种困难面前低头。李钟燮提出了“一分钟也不能停止生产！”的战斗口号，跟着许多工人都响应了。在两个月的停电期间，他们动员了所有的力量，用人力代替机器操作，保证了生产任务的完成。一九五二年，他们虽然遇到了这次大的困难，却提前七十五天完成了全年生产计划。这是他们对敌人破坏的有力回击。
    朝鲜的战争停止了。李钟燮怀着无限热情和希望，投入了祖国的恢复重建工作。他时刻想着如何用更大的生产成绩从废墟上创造幸福生活。桂生矿山有三分之一的工人和技术人员，走上了基本建设的光荣岗位，留下来的人需要担负更多的生产任务。李钟燮认识到：必须使一个人干两个人的活，才能完成生产任务，但是这不能靠提高劳动强度来解决，唯一办法是要让每个人都很快地学会科学技术，掌握先进的采矿法。于是，他积极地把自己的工作方法和经验传授给新的凿岩工人。他在每天都拿出二、三小时的时间给其他工人讲技术，一起讨论研究改进工作，并且把先进的采矿法表演给他们看。这样，他在停战后半年的时间内就培养了十几名技术工人，并且在他的帮助下矿山里涌现出不少的劳动革新者。李钟燮把帮助其他工人看做是自己的光荣任务。他现在正钻研着一种更新的工作方法，他说：“我要使凿岩机能动得更快，使祖国的建设恢复得更快。”就这样，他在离开矿山来中国访问的以前，以不到一个半月的时间，超额三分之一完成了一九五四年第一季度的生产计划。
    我怀着敬佩的心情听完了李钟燮的叙述。从他身上，我看见了勤劳、朴实、勇敢的朝鲜工人阶级在战争和恢复时期忘我劳动的英雄气概，看见了这个英雄国家幸福美好的未来。我紧握着李钟燮的手和他告别。他这双粗壮有力的手啊！为祖国付出了多少可贵的劳动，蕴藏着多少建设祖国幸福明天的雄厚力量！
