    The Increasingly Growing Vietnam National United Front
    Chairman of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, Sun Desheng
    This year, March 3rd marks the joint anniversary of the unification of the "Viet Minh" and "Viet Lien," the establishment of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the formation of the alliance of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    We are celebrating this anniversary amidst glorious victories this year. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, in liberated areas or in enemy-occupied areas, from north to south, we have achieved great victories everywhere. In the autumn and winter seasons of last year, the Vietnam People's Army and the people's liberation armies of the fraternal countries of Laos and Cambodia dealt the enemy more severe blows than in any previous autumn and winter. Since the French invading army implemented the "Navarre Plan" and invaded the southwest of Ninh Binh province, they have been annihilated by more than 46,000 soldiers. We have liberated vast areas in Lai Chau, Kon Tum, and other provinces, expanded the Red River Delta, and extended the guerrilla zones and guerrilla bases in Guangping, Guangzhi, Thua Thien in central Vietnam and other regions of South Vietnam. Due to military victories, hundreds of thousands of our ethnic minority people have been liberated, and the enemy's conspiracies to provoke and divide our national unity have once again been shattered. The ethnic policies promulgated by the Central People's Government last year have been faithfully implemented by the people, and the unity among the people has thus been further consolidated. The victories of our army in the Bui Chu, Kim Son, and other areas of the Red River Delta, Thai Binh province, as well as in Can Tho and Tay Ninh provinces of Vietnam, further clearly demonstrate the active support of Vietnamese religious followers for the People's Army in annihilating French colonialists, American interventionists, and those puppet lackeys who wear religious cloaks. Our series of victories have greatly undermined the morale of the enemy army. In many places, entire platoons and companies of puppet troops abandoned their strongholds and surrendered to the resistance forces. Many people laid down their weapons and returned to their hometowns, or disobeyed the orders of enemy and puppet officers, and even killed these officers. These phenomena have caused great anxiety to French and American imperialism.
    While achieving military victories, the Vietnamese people have also achieved major victories in their struggle against local tyrants and reactionary landlords. With the powerful strength of millions of peasants, the influence of the feudal landlord class in the countryside for thousands of years has been partially destroyed; the peasants have initially gained political superiority and partial economic rights in the countryside.
    The achievement of these victories has cleared the reactionary landlords and their lackeys out of the national united front. In villages where the peasant masses have been mobilized, local tyrants and reactionary landlords can no longer lurk in the national united front and use the national united front as a cover to carry out their insidious and vicious means.
    The power of the peasants, who account for about 90 percent of the country's total population, is extremely strong. They are enthusiastically participating in peasant associations, thereby strengthening the peasant associations. As a result, the foundation of the national united front—the worker-peasant alliance—has become more solid.
    Peasants with religious beliefs have actively launched a relentless struggle against Vietnamese traitors and reactionary landlords who wear religious cloaks, eliminating the mutual hostility between religious and non-religious people caused by imperialism and feudal landlords for nearly a hundred years. Last year, the ethnic policy proposed by the Vietnam National United Front was approved and promulgated by the People's Government. The National Conference of Religious Representatives held last August and the religious followers in various places all expressed warm welcome, further enhancing the spirit of solidarity among compatriots.
    The movement to mobilize the masses has also achieved good results in ethnic minority areas. That is to say, mutual discrimination between ethnic minorities, between people in highland areas, and people in plain areas has also gradually been eliminated. People in various places, no matter which ethnic group they belong to, recognize that the common enemy of the Vietnamese people is the imperialist aggressors, local tyrants, and reactionary landlords, and they also see through the evil conspiracies of these enemies to create division and mutual hatred among the various ethnic groups. Therefore, the unity among the various ethnic groups has become even closer. At the expanded meeting of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front at the end of 1953, the attendees unanimously supported the land reform program proposed by the Vietnam Workers' Party. Subsequently, the Third Session of the Vietnam National Assembly also approved the Land Reform Law. After this great Land Reform Law was promulgated, the people of Vietnam were immensely inspired.
    One of the most important victories achieved by the Vietnam National United Front last year was the victory of the party consolidation and army rectification movement proposed and led by the Vietnam Workers' Party. After training, party members and non-party cadres in various departments, as well as democratic figures, all recognized the correctness of the current revolutionary policy and line of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. At the same time, they were able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and recognize the leading role of the Vietnamese working class and its vanguard—the Vietnam Workers' Party—in the revolution. Therefore, they are more united than ever, and their patriotism has been further enhanced. The various democratic parties and people's organizations in the national united front have a deeper understanding and closer cooperation with each other.
    From the above victories, we can draw the conclusion that in the past year, the Vietnam National United Front has been greatly strengthened.
    The Vietnam National United Front is also an important force in the alliance of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The people's forces of Vietnam and Laos have liberated many vast areas along the Vietnam-Laos border, which has brought the people of Vietnam and Laos closer together. The strength of the alliance of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos has become even more consolidated.
    The Vietnam National United Front is also an integral part of the world's forces for peace and democracy. The people of the whole country enthusiastically participated in the "Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month"; the people of various fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, gave us enthusiastic encouragement, which further strengthened the great friendship and solidarity between the people of our country and the people of various fraternal countries.
    However, American and French imperialism and their puppets and lackeys—Vietnamese traitors and feudal landlords—seeing that our people are becoming increasingly united and have achieved such great victories, are struggling more frantically. They have tried every means to provoke the friendship between the various ethnic groups in our country, attempting to deceive the people in the French-occupied areas by various despicable means. They have played the tricks of false "land reform," "elections," and so-called "independence." In order to intensify the implementation of the vicious conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," they have used all kinds of barbaric means to forcibly recruit young people, and even arrest women, to serve as puppet troops to replenish their significant losses in manpower.
    The recent major victories of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have made American imperialism even more alarmed. It is doing everything possible to urge the French colonialists to continue to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and is increasingly brazenly interfering in the liberation wars of the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. It has dispatched a large number of air force personnel and aircraft to "aid" the French colonialists in slaughtering the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    This vicious action of American imperialism has made the Vietnamese people and the people of Cambodia and Laos even more hateful of the French colonialists and American interventionists. In its recent statement protesting the direct intervention of American imperialism in the Indochina War, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace once again expressed the Vietnamese people's determination to fight: "No matter what vicious conspiracies the American and French imperialists may resort to, the Vietnamese people will fight more resolutely to strive for national independence and make contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world." Last year, due to our strengthened unity, we achieved many victories, especially major victories in the military field and in mobilizing the peasant masses, which promoted the further strengthening of unity among our army and people, and the Vietnam National United Front has become more consolidated and expanded. This year, celebrating the "March 3rd" festival, our army and people throughout the country must further strengthen unity, defend the national united front, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, resolutely shatter the enemy's conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," and actively implement the two central tasks proposed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the People's Government, and the Vietnam Workers' Party: "Promote resistance and implement land reform," and strive for greater and more glorious victories.

    正在日益壮大中的越南民族统一战线
    越南国民联合战线全国委员会主席  孙德胜
    今年三月三日是“越盟”、“越联”统一，越南劳动党成立和越南、高棉、寮国三国人民联盟成立三周年联合纪念日。
    今年我们是在辉煌的胜利中举行这一纪念的。不论在前线或在后方，在解放区或在敌占区，从北到南，我们到处都获得巨大胜利。去年秋冬两季，越南人民军和寮国、高棉两个兄弟国家的人民解放军，曾给予敌人比过去任何一个秋冬季更严重的打击。自从法国侵略军执行“纳瓦尔计划”进犯宁平省西南以来，他们已被消灭了四万六千多名的兵员。我们已解放了莱州、昆嵩等省许多广大的地区，扩展了红河三角洲，中越的广平、广治、承天和南越等地区的游击区和游击根据地。由于军事上的胜利，我们的几十万少数民族人民获得解放，敌人妄图挑拨和分裂我们民族团结的阴谋诡计又一次被粉碎了。去年中央人民政府所颁布的民族政策，获得人民忠实的执行，人民间的团结因而更加巩固了。我们的军队在红河三角洲的裴朱、金山等地区，太平省以及越南的芹苴和西宁省的胜利，更显著地证明了越南宗教徒们积极拥护人民部队歼灭法国殖民者、美国干涉者和那些披着宗教外衣的傀儡走狗们。我们一系列的胜利，已大大地打击了敌军的士气。在许多地方，整排整连的伪军放弃了据点，向抗战队伍投诚。许多人放下了武器返回家乡，或者不服从敌伪军官的指挥，甚至把这些军官杀死。这些现象使得法、美帝国主义大为焦虑。
    在军事上胜利的同时，越南人民在向恶霸、反动地主进行斗争时也获得了重大胜利。在几百万农民雄厚的力量之下，封建地主阶级几千年来在农村中的势力一部分已被打垮了；农民们在农村中已初步地取得了政治上的优越地位和部分的经济权利。
    取得了这些胜利，就把反动地主及其走狗们从民族统一战线中清洗出去。在农民群众已发动起来的乡村里，恶霸和反动地主再也不能潜伏在民族统一战线里，利用民族统一战线为掩护去施展其阴险毒恶的手段了。
    约占全国人口总数百分之九十的农民的力量是极其强大的。他们正在踊跃地参加农会，从而使农会更加壮大起来。由此，民族统一战线的基础——工农联盟，就更加稳固了。
    有宗教信仰的农民们已积极地向披着宗教外衣的越奸分子和反动地主展开无情的斗争，消除了近百年来由于帝国主义和封建地主所造成的宗教徒和非宗教徒之间的互相敌视。去年由越南国民联合战线提出的民族政策，得到人民政府的批准和颁行。去年八月间举行的全国宗教界代表会议和各地的教徒们都一致表示热烈的欢迎，进一步提高了同胞们的团结精神。
    发动群众的运动在少数民族地区也同样收到良好效果。这就是说，少数民族之间，高原地区人民和平原地区人民之间的互相歧视也逐渐消除了。各地的人民，无论他们是属于哪个民族，都认清越南人民的公敌是帝国主义侵略者、恶霸和反动地主，同时也看透了这些敌人妄图在各民族之间制造分裂和互相仇视的罪恶阴谋。因此，各个民族之间的团结更加亲密无间了。一九五三年底，在越南国民联合战线全国委员会扩大会议上，出席者一致拥护越南劳动党所提出的土地改革纲领。接着越南国民大会第三次会议也批准了土地改革法。这个伟大的土地改革法公布以后，越南全国人民无比振奋。
    越南民族统一战线去年所获得的最重要的胜利之一是由越南劳动党提出和领导的整党和整军运动的胜利。各部门的党员和非党员干部们以及民主人士们经过整训之后，都认清了现阶段反帝反封建的革命政策和路线的正确性，同时也能分清敌我界限并认识到越南工人阶级和它的先锋队——越南劳动党在革命中的领导作用。因此他们比任何时候都更加团结，爱国主义精神也有了进一步的提高。民族统一战线中的各个民主党派和人民团体，相互间有了更深的了解和更加密切的合作。
    从上述的胜利看来，我们可以作出这样的结论：在过去的一年中，越南民族统一战线是大大地壮大起来了。
    越南民族统一战线也是越南、高棉和寮国三国人民联盟的一个重要力量。越南和寮国的人民部队已解放了越、寮边境许多广阔的地区，这就使越、寮两国人民更加密切地团结在一起。越南、高棉和寮国三国人民联盟的力量从此更加巩固了。
    越南民族统一战线也是世界和平民主力量的一个组成部分。全国人民热烈地参加了“越苏中友好月”；各兄弟国家，特别是苏联和中国的人民给了我们以热情的鼓舞，这就更加强了我国人民和各兄弟国家人民之间的伟大的友谊和团结。
    可是美、法帝国主义及其傀儡和走狗——越奸和封建地主们，看到我国人民日趋团结和取得这样巨大胜利，就更加疯狂地进行挣扎。他们曾千方百计地挑拨我国各族人民间的友谊，妄图以种种卑鄙手段来欺骗法占区的人民。他们玩弄了虚假的“土地改革”、“选举”以及所谓“独立”的把戏。他们为了加紧实现“用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋，就以各种野蛮的手段强拉青年，甚至逮捕妇女们去充当伪军，以补充它们在兵员上的重大消耗。
    最近越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的重大胜利，更使美帝国主义惶恐不安。它正用尽办法催促法国殖民者继续扩大侵越战争，并正越来越猖狂地干涉越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的解放战争。它派遣了大批的空军人员和飞机“援助”法国殖民者来屠杀越南、高棉、寮国三国人民。
    美帝国主义这种凶恶的行动使越南人民和高棉、寮国人民更加仇恨法国殖民者和美国干涉者。最近越南保卫世界和平委员会在抗议美帝国主义直接干预印度支那战争的声明中，再次表明越南人民坚决斗争的意志：“不管美国和法国帝国主义者会使出怎样恶毒的阴谋，越南人民将更坚决地斗争，以争取国家的独立，为保卫亚洲与全世界和平作出贡献。”去年由于我们加强了团结而获得许多胜利，特别是在军事方面和发动农民群众方面的重大胜利，从而促使我国军民更加加强了团结，越南民族统一战线更加巩固和扩展。今年庆祝“三·三”节，我们全国军民必须进一步加强团结，捍卫民族统一战线，巩固工农联盟，坚决粉碎敌人“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，积极地实行胡志明主席、人民政府和越南劳动党所提出的两个中心任务：“推进抗战，实现土地改革”，进而争取更巨大的和更辉煌的胜利。
