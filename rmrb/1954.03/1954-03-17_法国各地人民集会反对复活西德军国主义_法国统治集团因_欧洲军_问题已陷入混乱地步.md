    People's Rallies Throughout France Oppose the Revival of West German Militarism
    French Ruling Clique in a State of Confusion over the "European Army" Issue
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 16th] According to TASS, Paris: Responding to the call of twenty-two prominent social and political leaders, people throughout France gathered and laid flowers at war memorials on the 13th and 14th to condemn the revival of West German militarism.
    The Paris Prefect of Police, Baylot, dispatched police to block roads leading to the Champs-Élysées and the Place de l'Étoile, where the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located. However, the police were unable to prevent the working people of Paris from expressing their will. According to democratic newspapers, three thousand students and professors from the University of Paris held a rally and laid wreaths at the monument to anti-fascist martyrs to protest the arming of West Germany. Similar rallies were held at the Gare de Lyon, Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, and in working-class residential areas in the suburbs of Paris.
    In Nancy, three thousand people gathered and laid flowers at the war memorial. In Orléans, five hundred people laid flowers, including leaders of local Communist, Socialist, and Gaullist organizations.
    In Tarbes, Lyon, Grenoble, Gafri, and many other French cities, people laid flowers at war memorials to protest the arming of West Germany.
   [Xinhua News Agency, March 15th] According to TASS, Paris, March 13th: French political figures are currently in a state of unprecedented confusion over the issue of the "European Defense Community" and the rearmament of Germany.
   "Libération" said: Bidault and Pleven recently adopted some measures towards the parliamentary groups of various parties, trying to induce the National Assembly to start debating the ratification of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty as soon as possible. Pleven in particular is trying his best to get the "European Defense Community" accepted in principle during the upcoming debate on the military budget.
    However, another group of "European Army" supporters believe that there is no need to rush the discussion of this issue in the National Assembly.
    According to "Combat", the leaders of the Popular Republican parliamentary groups in the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic told Foreign Minister Bidault that the time was not yet ripe for parliamentary debate on the "European Army" issue. They fear that "launching an ill-prepared debate when the time is not ripe" will cause "serious confusion in the government and parliament."
    The confusion within the "European Army" supporters arises because their attempts to ratify the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty have encountered serious obstacles. "Le Monde" said: Recently, when the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly was examining the Japy report advocating the ratification of the Bonn Treaty, fierce debates took place. In the end, the committee only decided to use the part of Japy's report that analyzed the articles of the Bonn Treaty as the basis for discussion, and deleted his conclusions. In addition, Parisian newspapers also said that Mock, who opposes the "European Army," intends to insist on his own opinions when the Foreign Affairs Committee begins a general debate on his report on the "European Army" and Japy's report.

    法国各地人民集会反对复活西德军国主义
    法国统治集团因“欧洲军”问题已陷入混乱地步
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国各地人民响应二十二个著名社会领袖和政界领袖的号召，十三日和十四日在战争死难者纪念碑前集会献花，谴责西德军国主义复活。
    巴黎警察厅长贝洛派警察封锁了通向爱丽舍大街的各条路和无名战士公墓所在地的星广场。但是，警察并没有能够阻止住巴黎劳动人民表示自己的意志。据民主报纸报道，巴黎大学有三千学生和教授举行集会，并且在反法西斯烈士纪念碑前献上花圈，表示抗议武装西德。巴黎的里昂车站、北站、东站和市郊工人住宅区，都举行了同样性质的集会。
    在南锡，有三千人在战争死难者纪念碑前集会献花。在奥尔良，献花的有五百人，其中有共产党、社会党和戴高乐党地方组织的领导人。
    在塔布、里昂、格累诺布尔、加弗里及法国其他许多城市，人们都向战争死难者纪念碑献花，以示抗议武装西德。
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：法国政界人士目前在“欧洲防务集团”问题以及重新武装德国问题上陷入空前混乱的地步。
   “解放报”说：皮杜尔和普利文最近对各党议会党团采取了一些手段，想诱使国民议会尽速开始辩论批准波恩条约和巴黎条约的问题。普利文尤其是竭力要在快要举行的军事预算辩论中使“欧洲防务集团”在原则上被接受下来。
    不过，另一批“欧洲军”支持者却认为不必急于在国民议会中讨论这个问题。
    据“战斗报”消息，国民议会和共和国参议院人民共和党议会党团的领袖们曾经告诉外交部长皮杜尔说：议会辩论“欧洲军”问题的时机还没有成熟。他们担心：“在时机没有成熟的时候展开准备得很不充分的辩论”，会在“政府和议会中引起严重混乱”。
     “欧洲军”支持者内部所以发生混乱，是因为他们要批准波恩条约和巴黎条约的企图遭到了严重的障碍。“新闻报”说：最近国民议会外交委员会在审议加包里的主张批准波恩条约的报告时，发生了激烈的辩论。最后，这个委员会只决定以加包里报告中分析波恩条约条文的部分作为讨论基础，而删去了他的结论。此外，巴黎的报纸还说，反对“欧洲军”的莫克打算在外交委员会开始就他的关于“欧洲军”的报告和加包里的报告进行一般性辩论时，坚持自己的意见。
