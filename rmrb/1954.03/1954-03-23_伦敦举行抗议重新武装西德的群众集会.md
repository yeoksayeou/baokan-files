Xinhua News Agency, London, March 19th: A mass rally protesting the remilitarization of Germany, sponsored by the Democratic Vigilance League, was held at Denison House on March 16th, according to a TASS report from London on March 17th.

    Chairman Maurice Orbach (Labour MP) said in his opening remarks that the majority of the British people were opposed to the arming of Germany. He called on those present to launch a mass protest movement in factories, trade unions, cooperatives and other public organizations.

    William Warbey (Labour MP) said that members of the British Parliament were constantly receiving letters from people in their constituencies asking them to refuse to support the so-called "European Defence Community."

    Warbey stressed that arming Germany according to the demands of the United States was a direct path to another world war, regardless of what organization the armed Germany joined, whether it was the "European Defence Community" or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Warbey also pointed out that West Germany's joining the "European Defence Community" would make the unification of Germany, a peaceful solution to the European problem, and an agreement with the Soviet Union—which are all necessary and should be achieved—impossible.

    Referring to the results of the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, Warbey emphasized that Eden's plan at the Berlin Conference was merely a trick to deceive the people who genuinely hoped for a peaceful solution to the German problem. Warbey also criticized those who considered the Berlin Conference a failure. He called for continued consultations with the Soviet Union. His words won a storm of applause from the audience.

    The next speaker was George Doughty, General Secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen's Association. His speech had been reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the union. He refuted the bourgeois propaganda claiming that the Soviet Union had aggressive intentions. He said that now, political and economic power in West Germany was in the hands of those who had paved the way for Hitlerism. He said that arming West Germany was not in the interest of peace and insulted those who sacrificed in the anti-fascist war.

    Labour MP Michael Foot said that the British government's decision to support the creation of a West German army was against Britain's own interests. He criticized the Labour leadership's policy on this issue.

    The final speaker was Claude Bourdet, director of the French magazine "Observateur Aujourd'hui." He said that the vast majority of the French people opposed arming Germany. He emphasized that France's participation in the "European Defence Community" would inevitably jeopardize France's national sovereignty and stifle the workers' movement, as the "European Army" would play the role of "European gendarme."

    Bourdet went on to say that the Americans were trying to force France to ratify the "European Defence Community" treaty. The British government was also helping the American government in this endeavor. He called on those present to help the French people and force the British government to stop supporting plans to rebuild the machinery of world war. Bourdet concluded amidst a storm of applause: "Defend the interests of Europe, Britain and the whole world, do not betray us!"

    伦敦举行抗议重新武装西德的群众集会
   【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十七日讯：三月十六日，由民主监督联盟主持，在丹尼逊大厦举行了一个抗议德国重新军国主义化的群众集会。
    主席莫里斯·奥巴奇（工党议员）在开幕辞中说，大多数英国人民都反对武装德国。他要求到会的人在工厂、工会、合作社和其他公众组织中发动大规模的抗议运动。
    威廉·华贝（工党议员）说，英国议会议员们不断地收到他们选区人民的来信，要求他们拒绝支持所谓“欧洲防务集团”。
    华贝强调指出，按照美国的主张武装德国，是直接走向另一次世界大战的道路，不论武装起来的德国将参加什么组织，“欧洲防务集团”也好，北大西洋联盟也好。华贝同时指出，西德加入“欧洲防务集团”，会使德国的统一、和平解决欧洲问题及与苏联达成协议——这是应当而且必要的——成为不可能。
    华贝谈到柏林四外长会议的结果时强调指出，艾登在柏林会议上提出的计划，只不过是一种欺骗真正希望和平解决德国问题的人民的诡计。华贝并指责了那些认为柏林会议是失败的人们。他要求与苏联继续协商。他的话赢得了听众的暴风雨般的掌声。
    接着发言的是机器制造与造船业设计师工会书记乔治·道蒂。他的发言是经过该工会执行委员会审查并同意的。他驳斥了资产阶级宣传说苏联有侵略意图的谰言。他说，现在，西德的政权和经济权都掌握在那些曾经为希特勒主义铺平道路的人们的手中。他说，武装西德不符合和平的利益，侮辱了在反法西斯战争中牺牲的人们。
    工党议员迈克尔·福特说，英国政府支持建立西德军队的决定，是违背了英国本身的利益的。他批评了工党领导方面对这个问题所采取的政策。
    最后发言的是法国“今天观察家”杂志社社长克劳德·布尔戴。他说，绝大多数法国人民反对武装德国。他着重指出，法国参加“欧洲防务集团”，将不可避免地要危害法国的国家主权，并窒息工人运动，因为“欧洲军”将扮演“欧洲宪兵”的角色。
    布尔戴接着说，美国人正企图强迫法国批准“欧洲防务集团”条约。英国政府也帮助美国政府进行这种活动。他要求到会的人帮助法国人民，迫使英国政府不再支持重新制造世界大战的机器的计划。布尔戴最后在暴风雨般的掌声中说：“保卫欧洲、英国和全世界的利益，不要出卖我们！”
