    The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee has decided to transfer 160 cadres at the prefectural committee level to support the construction of 141 key national projects. The first batch of 20 people arrived at the relevant departments of the Central People's Government in January to study, and the remaining 140 people will arrive at their work locations successively before May. Most of these cadres have been tempered by long-term revolutionary struggles and have led the masses in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the People's Liberation War, the great land reform movement, and the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. These cadres have rich work experience and high political awareness, are in good health, and generally have a cultural level above junior high school.
    Hebei Province is one of China's famous old revolutionary base areas. In the later period of the People's Liberation War, tens of thousands of outstanding cadres from the province went south with the army, playing a very important role in supporting the liberation of the Jiangnan area. From 1951 to 1953, Hebei Province successively transferred more than 10,000 outstanding cadres to state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines, including 76 cadres at the prefectural committee level and 867 cadres at the county committee level. Now, most of these cadres have become the backbone of enterprise management and hold important positions in factories and mines. In order to prepare more cadres for transfer to the industrial front, the organizations at all levels in Hebei Province are now generally equipped with one or two deputy positions, and a list of reserve positions has been determined, planning to train another 600 cadres at the prefectural committee level and 3,700 cadres at the county committee level in 1954.

    中共河北省委抽调大批干部支援重点工程
    【新华社讯】中共河北省委员会已决定抽调一百六十个地委一级的干部，支援全国一百四十一项重点工程的建设。现在第一批二十人已经在一月份到中央人民政府各有关部门进行学习，其余的一百四十人也将在五月份以前陆续到达工作地点。这批干部大部分都经过长期革命斗争的锻炼，曾经领导人民群众进行过抗日战争、人民解放战争、伟大的土地改革运动和农业互助合作运动。这批干部有较丰富的工作经验和较高的政治觉悟，身体健康，文化水平一般都在中学程度以上。
    河北省是我国著名的老革命根据地之一。在人民解放战争后期，全省曾有数万个优秀干部随军南下，对支援江南地区的解放起了很重要的作用。从一九五一年到一九五三年，河北省又先后有一万多个优秀干部转入国营、地方国营和公私合营的厂矿中工作，其中有地委一级干部七十六人，县委一级干部八百六十七人。现在这些干部大都已成为企业管理的骨干，担任了厂矿中的重要职务。为了准备更多的干部转入工业战线，目前，河北省的各级组织一般都配备了一个到两个副职，确定了后备职务名单，计划在一九五四年再培养地委一级干部六百人，县委一级干部三千七百人。
