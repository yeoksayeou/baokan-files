    Dulles's Frustration at the Latin American Conference
    Du Li
    After the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference concluded, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles hurriedly returned to Washington, and then led a group of people to Caracas, Venezuela, to attend the "Tenth Pan-American Conference." This U.S. Secretary of State, who had stumbled around in the Berlin Conference, encountered another setback in Caracas.
    Latin American countries requested that this Pan-American Conference discuss economic issues. They hoped that the United States could buy more of their raw materials and not depress the prices of their exported raw materials too much, while raising the prices of industrial products they needed to import from the United States; and they hoped that the United States would lower tariff barriers. However, the U.S. ruling group wanted the conference to discuss its draft proposal on "opposing international communist interference in American republics," which it had put forward at the Pan-American Council in November 1953. In many past conferences of the Pan-American organization, the United States had always coerced countries into discussing or passing some "anti-communist" resolutions to facilitate the United States' strengthening of its control over Latin America under the guise of the "communist threat," and driving the ruling groups of Latin American countries to suppress the people's movements for democracy and independence. This time, the U.S. proposal contained a special purpose: to interfere in the internal affairs of Guatemala in order to maintain its vested interests in Guatemala.
    The reason the United States regards Guatemala as a thorn in its side is that, after the country established a united front government of all strata in October 1944, it implemented a number of democratic measures to safeguard national interests, such as promulgating a new labor law, implementing land reform, and confiscating more than 220,000 acres of fallow banana plantation land of the United Fruit Company on the Pacific coast (accounting for 80 percent of the company's banana plantation land on the Pacific coast). It also announced that it would further confiscate 175,000 acres of fallow banana plantation land of the United Fruit Company on the Atlantic coast of Guatemala. It had also temporarily controlled two companies, the American-owned electric power company and the International Railways of Central America, several times because they owed taxes and did not agree to workers' wage increase demands. This was, of course, intolerable to the United States' colonial plunder policy in Guatemala.
    The United States is especially afraid that Guatemala's example of safeguarding independent sovereignty and adopting democratic and progressive measures will encourage the development of national independence movements in other Latin American countries. Therefore, for many years, U.S. imperialists have tried their best to attack Guatemala for being "red," attempting to use this as an excuse to interfere in Guatemala's internal affairs. A report published at the end of last year by the U.S. monopoly capitalist group "National Planning Association" openly advocated "following Franco's old path" and provoking bloody massacres within Guatemala. However, in order to conceal the sinister face of direct U.S. intervention, the report also advocated "using Pan-American treaties and institutions to deal with Guatemala." On January 11 this year, the U.S. "Time" magazine also revealed that the United States was prepared to use various methods at the Tenth Pan-American Conference to force the Guatemalan government to submit. If all kinds of methods failed, then "the last possibility of the United States acting alone is not non-existent."
    At the plenary meeting of the Pan-American Conference on March 4, Dulles openly used U.S. "economic assistance" and "cooperation" to Latin American countries as weapons to exert pressure on the participating countries. On the one hand, he said that the United States would carry out closer financial, economic, and cultural cooperation with Latin American countries, and vaguely promised that the U.S. government would adopt a more "generous" policy towards Latin America in terms of technical assistance, private investment, government loans, and tariffs (including tariffs on wool), but immediately followed up by saying that the United States would never economically "assist" Latin American countries until the "threat of communism" was eliminated, or at least reduced to the point where it was ineffective.
    However, Dulles's pressure did not receive the reaction he expected. This conference saw phenomena that had never been seen in previous Pan-American conferences. Many representatives stated that "they were extremely apprehensive about taking measures by their own country or by the Pan-American Conference to interfere in the political affairs of individual countries, because this would open the door for the United States to interfere in their own internal affairs." (Associated Press) Many countries proposed as many as forty amendments to the U.S. proposal.
    What made Dulles most embarrassed was the speech by Guatemalan Foreign Minister Guillermo Toriello at the plenary meeting on the 5th. The Guatemalan Foreign Minister mercilessly exposed the United States' conspiracy to use the excuse of opposing communism to interfere in Guatemala's internal affairs. He said that the reason why imperialists, monopoly capitalists, and some U.S. government officials attacked his government was only because it had adopted a land reform program and tried to improve the people's living standards. He condemned the U.S. policy as international McCarthyism, dollar diplomacy, and the "big stick" policy, pointing out that this policy would greatly hinder the good relations and sincere cooperation between American countries. He firmly stated that his country would follow its own path and would never tolerate anyone interfering in its internal affairs under any pretext.
    Foreign Minister Toriello's speech was greeted with prolonged and enthusiastic applause at the conference, which was undoubtedly a resounding rebuff to Dulles.
    Mexico and Argentina also opposed the U.S. policy of intervention. Mexican representative Roberto Córdova pointed out in his speech that the U.S. proposal "could be interpreted in the future in such a way that a certain country or group of countries could interfere in the affairs of another country." He said that the Mexican government believed that "every country has the right to elect a government that it likes." Argentine representative Rodolfo Muñoz also stated that Argentina "for the benefit of itself and its brother republics," rejected the policy of intervention.
    Latin American public opinion has also criticized the U.S. conspiracy to use the Tenth Pan-American Conference to further interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries. This shows that the U.S. ruling group's diplomatic tactics of fabricating the lie of a "communist threat" to promote its aggressive policy have become discredited in Latin America—a place regarded by U.S. monopoly capital groups as their private preserve.
    Although Dulles used pressure on March 13 to force the Caracas Conference to pass the proposal put forward by the United States, Guatemala voted against it during the vote, and Mexico and Argentina, two major Latin American countries, also abstained. The political failure of the U.S. proposal is an undeniable fact. The U.S. "New York Post" commented on the Tenth Pan-American Conference and admitted: "Dulles went to Caracas to attend the conference to organize an anti-communist front, but what he will leave behind is an emerging anti-'Americanism' front. Any verbal victories we have won cannot conceal the profound psychological failure we have suffered."

    杜勒斯在拉丁美洲会议上的挫折
    杜　里
    柏林四外长会议闭幕之后，美国国务卿杜勒斯匆匆忙忙返回华盛顿，接着就带领了一批人马赶到委内瑞拉的加拉加斯城去出席“第十届泛美会议”。这位在柏林会议上狼狈周章的美国国务卿，在加拉加斯又受到了挫折。
    拉丁美洲各国要求这次泛美会议讨论经济问题。它们希望美国能够多买一些它们的原料，而不要把它们出口的原料价格压得过低，同时却把它们需要自美国输入的工业品的价格抬得太高；并且希望美国降低关税壁垒。但是美国统治集团则要会议讨论它在一九五三年十一月的泛美理事会上提出的所谓“反对国际共产主义干涉美洲共和国”的草案。在过去许多次泛美组织的会议中，美国总是胁迫各国讨论或通过一些“反共”的决议，以便利美国在“共产主义威胁”的神话的掩盖下，加强它对拉丁美洲的控制，驱使拉丁美洲各国统治集团镇压人民的争取民主独立的运动。美国这一次的提案，更包含着一个特殊的目的，就是要干涉危地马拉的内政，以保持它在危地马拉的既得利益。
    美国之所以把危地马拉看作眼中钉，是因为这个国家于一九四四年十月建立了各阶层的统一战线的政府后，实行了若干维护民族利益的民主的措施，如颁布新的劳工法，实行土地改革，征收了美国联合水果公司在太平洋岸的二十二万余英亩香蕉园休耕土地（占该公司在太平洋岸香蕉园土地的百分之八十），并宣布要进一步征收联合水果公司在危地马拉大西洋岸的十七万五千英亩的香蕉园休耕土地，以及曾数度因美商电力公司、中美洲国际铁路公司欠付税款和不答应工人增加工资要求而临时管制过这两个公司。这当然是美国在危地马拉推行殖民地掠夺政策所不能容许的。
    美国尤其害怕危地马拉维护独立主权与采取民主进步措施的榜样，会鼓励了拉丁美洲其他国家民族独立运动的发展。因此，美帝国主义者多年来竭力攻击危地马拉“赤化”，企图以此为借口干涉危地马拉的内政。美国垄断资本家的团体“全国计划协会”在去年年底出版的一份报告书中公然主张
  “走佛朗哥的老路”，在危地马拉境内挑起血腥的屠杀。但是，为了掩饰美国直接干预的凶恶面目，该报告书又主张“利用泛美条约和机构来对付危地马拉”。今年一月十一日美国“时代”周刊也透露说：美国准备在第十届泛美会议上用各种方法逼迫危地马拉政府就范，如果各种做法都不成功，那么“美国单独行动的最后可能性并不是不存在的”。
    在泛美会议三月四日的全体会议上，杜勒斯公然以美国对拉丁美洲各国的“经济援助”与“合作”为武器，向与会的各国施行压力。他一面说美国将与拉丁美洲国家进行更密切的财政、经济和文化合作，并含糊地允诺美国政府将在技术援助、私人投资、政府贷款及关税（包括对羊毛的关税）方面对拉丁美洲采取较为“宽厚”的政策，但马上接着又说：在消除“共产主义的威胁”，或至少在减低这种“威胁”使之没有实际作用以前，美国决不会从经济上“援助”拉丁美洲各国。
    但是，杜勒斯的压力并未得到他意想的反响。这次会议出现了历届泛美会议所未见的现象，许多代表都表示“他们对由他们本国或由泛美会议采取措施以干涉个别国家政治事务一点，极感惶恐不安，因为这将为美国干涉他们自己的内政打开方便之门。”（美联社）许多国家对美国提案提出的修正，共达四十条之多。
    最使杜勒斯难堪的，是危地马拉外交部长吉勒摩·托里埃略在五日全体会议上的发言。危地马拉外长无情地揭露了美国用反对共产主义的借口来干涉危地马拉内政的阴谋。他说，帝国主义者、垄断资本家、以及美国的若干政府官员之所以攻击他的政府，只是因为它采行了土地改革纲领与设法提高人民的生活水平。他谴责美国的这种政策是国际麦卡锡主义，是美元外交，是“大棒”政策，指出这种政策将大大阻挠美洲国家之间的良好关系与真诚合作。他坚决表示他的国家将遵循自己的道路前进，决不能容忍别人以任何借口干涉它的内政。
    托里埃略外长的演说，在会议上受到长久的热烈鼓掌，这无疑是对杜勒斯的一个响亮的回击。
    墨西哥和阿根廷也反对美国的干涉政策。墨西哥代表罗伯托·科多巴在发言中指出：美国的建议“在以后可以作这样的解释，使某一个国家或国家集团可以干涉另一国家的事务”。他说，墨西哥政府认为，“每一个国家有权选出一个它所喜欢的政府”。阿根廷代表罗道夫·蒙诺斯也表示：阿根廷“为它自己以及各兄弟共和国的利益”，拒绝干涉政策。
    拉丁美洲各国舆论更是纷纷抨击美国想利用第十届泛美会议来进一步干涉拉丁美洲国家内政的阴谋。这说明美国统治集团制造“共产主义威胁”的谎言来推行侵略政策的外交手法，在拉丁美洲——美国垄断资本集团视为禁脔的地方，也不免声名狼藉了。
    杜勒斯虽然于三月十三日以压力迫使加拉加斯会议通过了美国提出的提案，但在表决时危地马拉投了反对票，拉丁美洲的两个大国家墨西哥和阿根廷也弃权。美国提案在政治上的失败已是无法掩盖的事实了。美国“纽约邮报”评论第十届泛美会议时也承认：“杜勒斯到加拉加斯去出席会议是要组织一个反共阵线，但是他留下的将是一个萌芽中的反对‘美国主义’的阵线。我们所赢得的任何口头胜利，都不能掩盖我们所遭受的深重的心理失败。”
