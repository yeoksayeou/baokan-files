　　Fighting on the Steel Transport Line
    ——Remembering Chen Sheng-yuan, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Liu Ye
    A golden hero's medal, shining brightly, is pinned on his chest. Within the golden light, shines the love of all the Korean people for him, shines supreme honor. Who is he? He is Chen Sheng-yuan, station worker and member of the Labor Party at the Wonsan Station in Korea, a hero of the Republic who has accumulated twelve merits, and a representative participating in the Korean People's Delegation to China this time. He is only twenty-five years old this year.

    Chen Sheng-yuan was born into a poor family. Like all the working people of Korea, he endured the bullying of landlords, capitalists, and imperialists. The sound of the "August 15th" liberation cannon declared the beginning of a new life for the Korean working people. From then on, Chen Sheng-yuan became the master of his own life. He, a worker at the Wonsan Automobile Factory, became a liaison officer at the Wonsan Station, and soon he was promoted from liaison officer to switch operator, and then to shunting operator. Due to his diligent study, within three months of becoming a shunting operator, he learned the driving skills of a general driver. Before the war, he received three certificates of merit from the director of the Wonsan Railway Administration for his work achievements.

    Life has tempered Chen Sheng-yuan into a person who is not afraid of hardship, loves labor, and has lofty ideals and a steely character. When the Korean War broke out, he saw with his own eyes his country's beautiful rivers and mountains turned into scorched earth, and innocent people were brutally murdered. Hatred surged in his heart every moment, further illuminating these excellent qualities shared by many Korean people. The following are just two examples of his countless heroic deeds.

    On the evening of May 23, 1952, a train numbered 5110, pulling twenty-five carriages loaded with military supplies, had just arrived at Wonsan Station. Just as Chen Sheng-yuan was dispatching the train to the first line, enemy warships began shelling Wonsan Station from the East Sea. Instantly, the station area was filled with smoke and fire, shrapnel and stones flew everywhere, and the train loaded with military supplies was in an extremely dangerous situation, with the possibility of being hit at any moment. At this time, Chen Sheng-yuan jumped into the locomotive without regard for his own safety, guiding the driver through the fire net of the artillery barrage, and drove towards another line. Shells exploded around the train, and shrapnel whistled and constantly hit the carriages. Boom! With a loud noise, a shell exploded about five meters to the right of the train, the driver was injured, and Chen Sheng-yuan's hat was blown off. But he was not panicked by this dangerous encounter, immediately replaced the injured driver, and drove the train himself, continuing forward. The bombing became more and more intense, and the enemy hung eight flares in the air, illuminating the station area as if it were daytime, and the speeding train was subjected to even more intense enemy fire. The five carriages at the rear of the train derailed due to continuous bombing. Chen Sheng-yuan risked danger to run and unhooked these five carriages. Another carriage was bombed and derailed, and he immediately unhooked this carriage. He dodged bombs from all directions, bravely rescuing the train. Finally, he temporarily abandoned the six derailed carriages and successfully drove the train to a safe area ten kilometers away from the station. It was four o'clock the next morning when he walked back to rescue the six carriages. So Chen Sheng-yuan, disregarding his fatigue, continued to lead other employees to quickly repair the bombed rails and rescued the six derailed carriages before dawn. In this way, the military supplies in all twenty-five carriages were safely delivered to the front line.

    One night last February, when enemy planes came to bomb Wonsan Station again, a train loaded with military supplies was about to enter the station. But at this time, it was impossible to use lights to direct the train's movement. What to do? Chen Sheng-yuan and Zhang Mingxiu, a railway worker from the Chinese People's Volunteers to Aid Korea, came up with a solution together. The two of them stood separately two hundred meters apart, and when the train entered the station, they followed the train and shouted to stop, making the train stop. However, the train did not avoid the enemy's bombing. They cleverly had the locomotive leave the train and advance rapidly in the thick smoke, deliberately exposing the target to the American aerial bandits, then suddenly braked to stop the smoke, using the momentum of the advance to drive the locomotive to a hiding place, abandoning the enemy's shooting target behind, and when the enemy plane flew high, they drove the locomotive back to lead the train away. In this way, this batch of important supplies was finally rescued.

    In the three years of arduous war, under the frenzied bombardment of enemy planes and artillery, Chen Sheng-yuan used his courage and wit to rescue so many supplies for his country: ten locomotives, one hundred and nineteen wagons, one hundred and thirty carriages of military supplies, and fifty-eight carriages of grain. What Chen Sheng-yuan saved was not just these materials that could be calculated in numbers, but he also saved the safety and happiness of the peace-loving people. For this reason, on February 6, 1953, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the highest honor – the title of "Hero of the Republic."

　　战斗在钢铁运输线上
    ——记朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄陈生渊
    刘野
    一颗闪着金色光辉的英雄勋章，佩戴在他的胸前。金光里，闪耀着全朝鲜人民对他的热爱，闪耀着崇高的荣誉。他是谁？他就是朝鲜元山车站站员、劳动党员、建立了十二次功勋的共和国英雄陈生渊，这次参加朝鲜人民访华代表团来到中国的代表，他今年才二十五岁。
    陈生渊出生在一个穷困的家里。他象所有朝鲜的劳动人民一样，忍受着地主、资本家和帝国主义的欺凌。“八·一五”解放的炮声，宣布了朝鲜劳动人民新生活的开始。陈生渊从此也做了生活的主人。他，一个元山汽车厂的工人，到元山车站当了联络员，以后很快他就从联络员升为扳闸手，又升为调车员了。由于他的苦心学习，在当了调车员以后不到三个月的时间，就学会了一般司机的驾驶技术。在战争以前，为了他的工作成就，他曾先后得到元山铁路管理局局长发给的三次奖状。
    生活，把陈生渊锻炼成了一个不怕艰苦、热爱劳动、具有崇高理想和钢毅性格的人。当朝鲜战争爆发以后，他亲眼看见祖国美丽的河山变成焦土，善良的人民惨遭杀害。仇恨，每时每刻都在冲激着他的心，更加使他这种为许多朝鲜人民所共有的优秀品质放射出了光辉。以下只是他无数英雄行为中的两个例子。
    一九五二年五月二十三日的傍晚，一列牵引着二十五辆装满军需物资的五一一○列车刚开到元山车站。正当陈生渊把列车调度到第一号线路的时候，敌人的炮舰从东海面上向着元山车站轰击起来。霎时，车站区烟火弥漫，弹片、石子到处飞，装着军需物资的列车处在极端危险的情况下，时刻都有被击中的可能。这时，陈生渊奋不顾身地跳上机车指引着司机穿过排炮的火网，向着别的线路开去。炮弹在列车的周围爆炸，弹片呼啸着不断地打在车皮上。轰！一声巨响，一颗炮弹在列车右侧五公尺左右的地方爆炸了，司机受了伤，陈生渊的帽子也被打飞了。但他没有为这危险的遭遇而惊慌失措，马上代替了受伤的司机，自己动手开车，继续前进。轰炸越来越紧了，敌人在空中挂起了八颗照明弹，车站区被照得如同白昼一样，奔驰着的列车遭到敌人更加激烈的射击。列车尾部的五辆车厢由于连续的轰炸脱轨了，陈生渊冒着危险跑去把这五辆车厢的挂钩解开，又有一辆车厢被炸脱了轨，他又立即解开这一辆车厢的挂钩。他躲避着前后左右的炸弹，英勇地抢救。最后，他暂时丢开了被炸脱轨的六辆车厢，胜利地把列车开到距离车站十公里的安全地带。等他步行回来再抢救那六辆车厢时，已经是次日清晨四点钟了。于是陈生渊不顾疲劳继续带领其他员工迅速地修复了被炸坏的道轨，于天亮前救回六辆脱轨的车厢。这样，二十五辆车厢的军需物资，全部安全地送到了前方。
    去年二月的一个深夜，当着敌人的飞机又来轰炸元山车站时，一列满载军需品的列车正要进站。但这时不能用灯光来指挥列车的行动，怎么办呢？陈生渊和中国人民志愿援朝的铁路员工张明秀共同想出了办法。他们两人分开站在相距二百公尺的地方，等列车进站时追随着列车高喊停车，使列车停止了。然而，列车没有避开敌机的轰炸，他们机智地使机车甩掉列车，冒着浓烟急速前进，故意把目标暴露给美国空中强盗，然后猛然煞车停止喷烟，借着前进的冲力把机车开往隐蔽所，把敌人的射击目标抛弃在后面，乘敌机高飞的时候，再把机车倒回来引走列车。这样，终于抢救了这批重要的物资。
    在三年来艰苦的战争中，在敌人飞机大炮疯狂的轰击下，陈生渊用自己的勇敢和机智为祖国抢救了这样多的物资：十辆机车，一百一十九个车皮，一百三十个车厢的军需品和五十八个车厢的粮食。陈生渊所拯救的决不仅仅是这些可以用数字计算的物资，他同时也拯救了和平人民的安全和幸福。为此，一九五三年二月六日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会特授给他最大的荣誉——“共和国英雄”的称号。
