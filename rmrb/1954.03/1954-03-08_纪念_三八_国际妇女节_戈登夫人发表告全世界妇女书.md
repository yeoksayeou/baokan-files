Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th: Madame Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, has issued a letter to the women of the world on the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day. She said that the celebration of "March 8th" International Women's Day this year is particularly heartening due to the enormous hope for the easing of international tensions resulting from the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. This conference did not satisfy all the wishes of the people of all countries, but it marks the beginning of an era of consultation, and our hopes arise from this. The conference has set the date in April for a meeting in Geneva to discuss the Korean and Vietnamese issues. The participation of the People's Republic of China in this meeting is a precedent of paramount importance.

Madame Gordon said that the Berlin Conference discussed the issue of disarmament, which women all over the world have fought for at such a great cost. Although the conference failed to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian questions, it has at least studied various solutions to these two problems. The proposals made by Molotov for guaranteeing collective security in Europe have opened up broad prospects.

Madame Gordon pointed out that the women of all countries, after gaining valuable experience from the World Women's Congress held in Copenhagen last June, are encouraged by these new and powerful hopes, and the "March 8th" International Women's Day in 1954 will become a great day of demonstration for united action.

Madame Gordon concluded by saying that in addition to holding some grand gatherings this year, many small gatherings will be held in various places so that many women in various countries who have not yet participated in the women's movement can participate in this joint action. In this way, we will undertake the tasks given to us by the Copenhagen Conference, and we will effectively strive to accomplish our great cause: that is, to defend the rights of women and children, and to win peace.

    纪念“三八”国际妇女节
    戈登夫人发表告全世界妇女书
    【新华社柏林七日电】国际民主妇女联合会主席戈登夫人发表“三八”国际妇女节告全世界妇女书。她说：由于柏林四国外长会议所产生的国际局势缓和的巨大希望，今年庆祝“三八”国际妇女节格外令人欢欣鼓舞。这次四国外长会议并没有满足各国人民所有的愿望，但是这次会议标志着一个协商时代的开始，我们的希望就产生在这里。会议已经确定了四月间在日内瓦召开一个讨论朝鲜和越南问题的会议的日期。中华人民共和国将参加这个会议，这是一件具有头等重要意义的先例。
    戈登夫人说：柏林会议曾讨论了裁减军备问题，这是全世界妇女花了那么多的代价所争取的事。会议虽未能就德国问题和奥地利问题取得协议，但至少已研究了这两个问题的各种解决办法。莫洛托夫提出的保障欧洲集体安全的建议，已打开了广阔的远景。
    戈登夫人指出：世界各国的妇女们在获得了去年六月在哥本哈根召开的世界妇女大会的宝贵经验以后，又为这些新的、强有力的希望所鼓舞，一九五四年的“三八”国际妇女节将成为一个团结行动的巨大示威日。
    戈登夫人最后说：今年除了举行一些盛大的集会外，还将在各地举行许多小的集会，以便使各国直到目前还没有参加妇女运动的许多妇女都参加这一共同行动。这样，我们将负起哥本哈根大会所给予我们的任务，我们将有效地为完成我们的伟大事业而努力：这就是保卫妇女和儿童的权利，赢得和平。
