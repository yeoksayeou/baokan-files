    Worker Old Brothers' New Farm Tools Reduce the Physical Labor of Rural Women
    A letter from Shen Jilan, Vice Chairman of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative (written by Huo Guishu and Wu Jinshan): Last year, all 44 women in our cooperative, in addition to doing housework, also participated in agricultural teams and worked 1,600 workdays, accounting for 34.7% of the total workdays of the cooperative. Although our cooperative suffered from drought last year, the crops still achieved a relatively high yield, and the income from sideline production also exceeded twice that of 1952; the active participation of women in labor played a significant role. The cooperative sowed tree seeds on 362 mu of barren hills, mostly done by women.
    These achievements of our cooperative's women members in production are inseparable from the support of the worker old brothers. For example, our cooperative's six single-bladed plows, three sprayers, three corn threshers, and chaff cutters, seed mixers, powder sprayers, as well as fertilizer powder and various pesticides, were all made by the worker old brothers in factories. These things have reduced much of our heavy labor and provided favorable conditions for our women to participate in agricultural production. This makes us deeply feel how much the help of the working class is needed for the complete liberation of rural women!
    Under the brilliant illumination of the general line, our cooperative has expanded from the original 47 households to about 200 households, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of farmers in the township; the number of women members has also greatly increased. Now I am working as the vice chairman of the cooperative. I think that if farmers want to produce enough grain and raw materials to support industry, they must more widely mobilize women to participate in agricultural production and constantly educate everyone to unite and work hard to produce. We are organizing women to widely find sources of fertilizer, planning to burn wasteland and accumulate 800 dan of fertilizer from the bottom of pots, and use methods such as accumulating sewage, sweeping "ge da," and lining pens to increase fertilizer, striving to increase the production of more grain to sell to the state this year.

### 工人老大哥制造的新农具减轻了农村妇女的体力劳动

    工人老大哥制造的新农具减轻了农村妇女的体力劳动
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社副社长申纪兰来信（霍贵书、吴金山代笔）：去年一年来，我们全社四十四个妇女除了做家务劳动外，都还参加了农业小组，做了一千六百个劳动日，占全社总劳动日的百分之三十四点七。去年我社虽然遭到旱灾，但庄稼还能得到较高的产量，副业生产收入也能超过一九五二年两倍；妇女积极参加劳动起了很大作用。社里在荒山播种树籽三百六十二亩，大部是妇女做的。
    我社妇女社员在生产中的这些成绩，是和工人老大哥的支援分不开的。例如，我社的六张单把犁、三架喷雾器、三架玉米脱粒机和铡草机、拌种机、喷粉器，以及肥田粉和各种农药，都是工人老大哥在工厂里造出来的。这些东西减轻了我们许多繁重的劳动，给我们妇女参加农业生产提供了有利的条件。这使我们深刻地感觉到：农村妇女要彻底解放，是多么需要工人阶级的帮助啊！
    在总路线光辉的照耀下，我社已由原来的四十七户扩大到二百户左右，占全乡总农户百分之七十以上；妇女社员也大大增加了。现在我担任副社长的工作。我想：农民要生产足够的粮食和原料支援工业，必须更广泛地发动妇女参加农业生产，经常地教育大家连成一心努力生产。我们正在组织妇女广泛地寻找肥源，计划薰荒、烧锅底积肥八百担，并用积污水、扫圪?、垫圈等办法来增加肥料，争取今年要增产更多的粮食卖给国家。
