    Carrying out Handicraft Cooperative Work
    Xuchang Special District, Henan Trains Cadres
    In mid-February to early March, the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province held a training class in Luohe City to train cadres to carry out handicraft cooperation. Participants included cadres from the county (city) Party committee offices, heads of production sections and processing enterprise sections of supply and marketing cooperatives, directors of handicraft production cooperatives, heads of production groups, and managers of cooperative processing plants. The first stage of the training class focused on studying the general line of the state during the transition period and researching the state's policy of socialist transformation of handicrafts. The second stage focused on learning practical experience. The Xuchang City Tin Production Group and the Luohe City Knitting Production Cooperative, among others, introduced their experiences in organizing production groups and establishing production cooperatives. During the learning process, the trainees examined and criticized some of the vague understandings and deviations in their past work on handicraft transformation, such as the belief that "handicrafts have no future," regarding the establishment of supply and marketing relationships with handicrafts as general trade relations, and neglecting the political task of carrying out socialist transformation of handicrafts. Finally, the trainees formulated preliminary plans for carrying out handicraft cooperation in the first half of 1954 based on the specific conditions of each county (city), and then returned to their posts with full confidence.

    开展手工业合作化工作
    河南许昌专区训练干部
    河南省许昌专区于二月中旬到三月初旬在漯河市举办训练班，训练开展手工业合作化工作的干部。参加受训的人员有：各县（市）委办公室的干部、供销合作社生产科长及加工企业科长、手工业生产合作社主任、生产小组组长、合作社加工厂经理等。训练班第一阶段，着重学习国家过渡时期的总路线，研究国家对手工业实行社会主义改造的政策。第二个阶段，学习实际经验。许昌市白铁生产小组、漯河市针织生产合作社等介绍了组织生产小组、办生产合作社的经验。在学习过程中，受训人员检查批判了过去对手工业改造的一些模糊认识和工作中的一些偏差，如认为“手工业没有前途”，把和手工业建立供销业务看作是一般性的贸易关系，忽视对手工业进行社会主义改造的政治任务等。最后，受训人员根据各县（市）具体情况初步制订了一九五四年上半年开展手工业合作化工作的计划，然后都满怀信心地回到工作岗位。　（焦树榛）
