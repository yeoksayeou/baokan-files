Short Commentary

    The results of the national mass song awards, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles over the past three years, have been announced. The awards show that, in these three years, the basic tendency of our mass song creation has been healthy and correct. First of all, the authors are working hard to integrate their creations with the current tasks of struggle, so that their works can reflect the people's lives, thoughts and feelings, and play a fighting role. The major struggles led by the Party during the three years of economic recovery and construction have been reflected to some extent in the winning works. These songs relatively truthfully express the optimism and active spirit of the broad masses of the people, and can give the people beneficial ideological and spiritual influence, and guide the people forward. At the same time, the authors are also striving to make their works have vivid images, and pay attention to using fresh and lively language that can be accepted and loved by the people. Many authors have been able to inherit the revolutionary song tradition since the New Music Movement, use the excellent heritage of our national singing art, and absorb the advanced experience of Soviet mass song creation for their creations.
    However, there are also obvious shortcomings in our mass song creation. The authors lack the necessary understanding of the rapid development of real life and the profound changes in the people's thoughts and feelings. The ideological and artistic quality of the works has not reached the due level.
    Most authors lack experience in life and political struggle, and lack rigorous training in artistic expression techniques. Many authors are not good at refining and processing the materials they have taken from life, and lack the necessary musical and literary cultivation, and are not familiar enough with the rich language of the people. In some works, although some sparks of true emotion burst out, the authors cannot further enrich and refine them. In order to continuously improve the creative level of mass songs, authors should continue to delve into the mass life struggle, and more deeply understand and express the thoughts and feelings of the masses; closely connect with the musical life of the masses, and understand the people's requirements for songs. On the other hand, authors must further study the excellent heritage of national music and poetry, and on this basis, better learn from the advanced experience of mass song creation in the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, improve their artistic expression ability, so that mass songs have profound ideological content and beautiful artistic form, to meet the people's high requirements.
    Mass song authors have worked hard and achieved results in the past few years. This award will greatly increase the authors' confidence and creative enthusiasm. Today, our country is advancing along the socialist road under the beacon of the general line of the transition period. Song authors are facing more important and glorious tasks. They must further improve their political thought and artistic level. They must create more and better works that reflect the people's struggle life and arm the people with socialist ideology.

    提高群众歌曲的创作水平
    中央人民政府文化部和中国文学艺术界联合会共同举办的三年来全国群众歌曲评奖公布了。从评奖的结果可以看出：在这三年中，我们的群众歌曲创作的基本倾向是健康的、正确的。首先，作者们都在努力使自己的创作与当前的斗争任务结合起来，使作品能够反映人民的生活、思想和感情，能够发挥战斗的作用。党在这三年经济恢复和建设时期中所领导的各项重大的斗争在得奖的作品中都得到了一定的反映。这些歌曲比较真实地抒写了广大人民的乐观主义情绪和积极奋发的精神，在思想上和精神上能够给人民以有益的影响，引导人民前进。同时，作者们也在努力使自己的作品具有鲜明的形象，并注意运用新鲜活泼的、为人民所能接受和喜爱的语言。许多作者都能继承新音乐运动以来的革命歌曲传统，利用了我们民族歌唱艺术的优秀遗产，吸取苏联群众歌曲创作的先进经验，进行创作。
    但我们的群众歌曲创作中还显然存在着缺点。作者们对于现实生活的迅速发展和人民思想感情的深刻变化还缺乏应有的认识。作品的思想性和艺术性还没有达到应有的水平。
    大多数作者都比较缺乏生活和政治斗争的经验，在艺术的表现技巧上缺乏严格锻炼。不少作者还不善于把从生活中摄取来的素材予以提炼和加工，还缺乏必要的音乐和文学的修养，对人民的丰富的语言不够熟悉。在有些作品里，虽则也迸发出一些真实感情的火花，但作者不能进一步去丰富它，提炼它。为了不断提高群众歌曲的创作水平，作者们应该继续深入群众生活斗争，更深刻地去认识和表现群众的思想感情；密切地联系群众的音乐生活，了解人民对于歌曲的要求。另一方面，作者们必须更进一步地学习民族音乐和诗歌的优秀遗产，并在这基础上更好地学习苏联和人民民主国家的群众歌曲创作的先进经验，提高自己的艺术表现能力，使群众歌曲具有深刻的思想内容和优美的艺术形式，以满足人民的高度的要求。
    群众歌曲作者们在过去几年中的工作是努力的，有成绩的。这次评奖将大大提高作者们的信心和创作的热情。今天，我们的国家正在过渡时期总路线的灯塔的照耀下沿着社会主义的道路前进，歌曲作者们面临着更重大的光荣任务，必须进一步提高自己的政治思想和艺术水平，必须创作更多更好地反映人民的斗争生活的作品，用社会主义思想把人民武装起来。
