    The Entire Command and Soldiers of the Tashan Heroic Regiment Write to Workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, Determined to Work Hard to Defend the Socialist Construction of the Motherland
    Comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:
    In the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, you overfulfilled your production tasks and laid the foundation for the industrialization of the motherland. Recently, you have again overfulfilled the February production plan. Your glorious achievements have greatly encouraged us. The commanders and soldiers of our Tashan Heroic Regiment extend our highest respect to you and to the Soviet experts!
    We remember that on February 14, 1948, we cooperated with fraternal troops to clear the periphery of Anshan; on the 19th, we began the general attack and quickly liberated Anshan. At that time, Anshan Iron and Steel was full of rubble and weeds. The machinery was destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, parts were scattered on the roadside, and crows and magpies were jumping on the steel beams of the workshops. We thought painfully: "When will the chimneys of Anshan Iron and Steel start smoking?" Soon after, we left the "Steel Capital", entered the pass and went south, fighting all the way to the South China Sea.
    In these years, we have always cared about Anshan Iron and Steel. In the distant seaside, whenever we heard news about the construction achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel, we felt extremely excited. Because we are interested in everything and everyone in Anshan Iron and Steel. When the news of the commissioning of the three major projects and the deeds of advanced producers such as Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and Meng Tai were published in the newspapers, the comrades all scrambled to read them. Because we know that Anshan Iron and Steel is a big red flag at the forefront of the country's industrialization, and the glorious achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel provide favorable conditions for building a modern national defense.
    After our preliminary study of the General Line, we have a clearer understanding of the bright future of socialism. We are conducting modern and comprehensive training with high enthusiasm, and striving to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and defend peace in the Far East and the world. We are determined and confident to eliminate any enemy who dares to invade the sacred territory of the motherland and destroy human peace.
    We are looking forward to news from you. Dear comrades, under the beacon of the General Line, let us encourage each other, make progress together, and work hard for the early arrival of a better and happier life!
                The entire command and soldiers of the Tashan Heroic Regiment

    塔山英雄团全体指战员给鞍钢工人写信
    决心为保卫祖国社会主义建设而努力
    鞍山钢铁公司全体同志们：
    在第一个五年计划的头一年，你们超额完成了生产任务，为祖国的工业化建设打下了基础。最近，你们又超额完成了二月份生产计划。你们这些光辉的成绩，使我们受到很大的鼓舞。我们塔山英雄团的指战员向你们、向苏联专家们致以崇高的敬礼！
    记得一九四八年二月十四日，我们配合兄弟部队扫清鞍山外围；十九日开始总攻击，很快解放了鞍山。那时候的鞍钢，到处是瓦砾荒草，机器给国民党反动派破坏了，路边上散放着零件，鸦鹊在车间钢梁上跳跃。我们沉痛地想：“鞍钢的烟囱什么时候才能冒烟呢？”不久，我们离开“钢都”，进关南下，一直打到南海边。
    在这些年月里，我们时刻关怀着鞍钢。在遥远的海边，每当我们听到关于鞍钢建设成就的消息时，就感到无比的兴奋。因为我们对鞍钢的每件事、每个人都感到兴趣。当报纸上发表三大工程投入生产的消息以及张明山、王崇伦、孟泰等先进生产者的事迹时，同志们都争相传诵。因为我们知道，鞍钢是国家工业化建设前列的一面大红旗，鞍钢的光辉成就，给建设现代化的国防提供了有利条件。
    我们初步学习总路线以后，更加明确认清了社会主义的光明前途。我们正以高度的积极性进行现代化的全面训练，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设、保卫远东与世界的和平而奋斗。我们有决心、有信心消灭任何敢于侵犯祖国神圣领土、破坏人类和平的敌人。
    我们盼望着来自你们那里的消息。亲爱的同志们，在总路线的灯塔照耀下，让我们互相鼓励，共同进步，为争取更美好、幸福的日子早日到来而努力吧！
                    塔山英雄团全团指战员
