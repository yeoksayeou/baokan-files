The rural credit cooperative organizations in North China have seen significant development, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, and with the assistance of the People's Banks at all levels, along with the restoration and development of agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, there were 2,716 credit cooperatives in the region, with more than 1,540,000 members and over 38.1 billion yuan in shares. At the same time, the credit departments and credit groups of supply and marketing cooperatives in the region have also developed considerably.

In recent years, these credit cooperative organizations have played a significant role in resolving the production and living difficulties of poor peasants, helping peasants develop production, promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production, and combating rural usury. According to incomplete statistics, they absorbed more than 162 billion yuan in farmer deposits (excluding physical objects) and issued 158 billion yuan in loans last year. They helped farmers purchase livestock, carts, walking plows, chemical fertilizers, seeds, etc., and solved farmers' funding problems for sideline production, as well as food shortages during the transition period between harvests and difficulties related to weddings, funerals, and illnesses. Lü Taiping, a farmer from Jie County, Shanxi Province, had three out of five family members fall ill at the beginning of last year. He borrowed 250,000 yuan from the credit cooperative. By March, his illness had not improved, and he encountered the spring famine, so he wanted to sell three houses and nine dan of wheat. After learning about this, the credit cooperative took the initiative to lend him more money, solving his difficulties. Everyone said: The credit cooperative is truly a lifesaver.

Credit cooperative organizations have powerfully promoted the development of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state. Last year, four relatively well-off households withdrew from the Hous Yongshan mutual aid team in Chishi, Jie County, Shanxi Province. The remaining nine households had a total of 215 mu of land, only one head of livestock, and one cart. It looked like the mutual aid team was about to collapse. In this situation, the credit cooperative lent them 3.4 million yuan to help solve the difficulties with livestock and fertilizer, enabling the entire team to achieve a bumper harvest. Now, the team has not only not broken up but has also transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. Due to the establishment and development of credit organizations, the production and living difficulties of farmers have been resolved in a timely manner, effectively combating usurious activities in rural areas and protecting the interests of the working people.

In addition to handling deposit and loan business in accordance with the financial policies of the state bank, the local credit cooperative organizations also act as agents for the deposit and loan business of the state bank, becoming a powerful assistant to the state bank active in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics from last year, the agricultural loans issued by credit cooperatives in Shanxi Province accounted for approximately 37 percent of the general production loans issued to farmers by the state bank in the province; they acted as agents for the state bank in issuing more than 15 billion yuan in general production loans and helped the bank recover approximately 30 billion yuan in loans that had matured.

Currently, under the unified leadership of the Party committees and governments, the People's Banks in various parts of North China are actively and steadily consolidating and developing credit organizations in order to further support the development of agricultural production.

    华北区农村信用合作组织有很大发展
    华北区的农村信用合作组织，随着农业生产的恢复和发展，在各级党委、政府的领导及各级人民银行的帮助下，有了很大的发展。据不完全统计，到去年年底止，全区有信用合作社二千七百一十六个，社员达一百五十四万余人，股金三百八十一亿余元。同时，全区供销合作社信用部、信用小组也有了相当发展。
    几年来，这些信用合作组织在解决贫苦农民生产和生活困难，及帮助农民发展生产促进农业生产互助合作运动，打击农村高利贷等方面，都起了显著作用。据不完全统计，去年共吸收农民存款（实物在外）一千六百二十余亿元，放款一千五百八十亿元。帮助农民添置了牲畜、大车、步犁、化学肥料、种籽等，解决了农民副业生产资金及青黄不接时的口粮和婚、丧、疾病等困难。山西省解县农民吕太平，在去年年初，一家五口病倒了三口，向信用合作社借了二十五万元，到三月份病未好又遇到了春荒，就想把三间房和九石小麦卖了，信用合作社知道后，就主动地又贷款给他，解决了他的困难。大家都说：信用合作社真是救急救难。
    信用合作组织，有力地促进了农业生产互助合作运动的发展和国家对农业的社会主义改造。山西省解县赤社侯永生互助组去年有四户富裕户退了组，剩下共九家共有二百一十五亩地，只有一头牲口一辆大车，眼看互助组要垮台了，在这种情况下，信用合作社贷给了他们三百四十万元，帮助解决了牲口、肥料困难，使全组得到了丰产。现在该组不但没有散伙，并且转成为农业生产合作社。由于信用组织的建立和发展，及时解决了农民的生产生活困难，有效地打击了农村高利贷的活动，保护了劳动人民的利益。
    各地信用合作组织，除了按照国家银行金融政策办理存放业务外，还代理国家银行存放业务，成为国家银行活跃在农村的有力助手。根据去年不完全的统计，山西省信用合作社共发放农业贷款约占该省国家银行对农民发放一般生产贷款的百分之三十七；代理国家银行发放一般生产贷款在一百五十亿元以上，帮助银行收回到期贷款约三百亿元。
    目前华北各地人民银行正在党委、政府的统一领导下，积极稳步地整顿和发展信用组织，以进一步扶持发展农业生产。
