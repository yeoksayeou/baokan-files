    New Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft of the Huainan Coal Mine commenced construction on the 10th. On that day, the Huainan Mining Bureau held a grand commencement ceremony at the construction site. At the meeting, the shaft construction workers expressed their determination to build these shafts well. Wang Kaicheng, an advanced worker who set the national shaft sinking record in 1952, stated his firm resolve to complete the glorious task of shaft construction, diligently learn from advanced Soviet experience, and ensure that the project is good, economical, fast, and safe.
    Xiejiaji No. 2 Shaft is the first pair of modernized shafts designed by our country's designers with the help of Soviet experts. After the mine is completed, the annual coal production of the Huainan Mining Bureau will increase by one-third compared to this year's production. This coal can also be refined into a large amount of coke to supply the needs of another steel base in Daye. According to the design requirements, the entire production process of these shafts, except for a very small portion, will be replaced by machinery instead of manual labor. The well will also be equipped with various modern fire prevention, waterproofing, and ventilation safety equipment. A three-story administrative and welfare complex building with sun lamp rooms will be built above ground.
    The construction of these shafts has received strong support from all sides. During the preparatory period before construction began, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, as well as Northeast China, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places supplied a large number of various machines and equipment for shaft construction. The Northeast sent more than sixty shaft construction technicians. The farmers near Xiejiaji organized more than one hundred ox carts to transport materials for the construction of the new well. In the days of heavy snow and continuous rain, the workers still insisted on working on the construction site, ensuring the project started on schedule. (Xinhua News Agency)

    淮南煤矿新建谢家集二号竖井工程开工
    淮南煤矿新建谢家集二号竖井已在十日破土开工。这一天，淮南矿务局在工地上举行了隆重的开工典礼大会。建井工人们在会上纷纷表示决心建好这对竖井。曾在一九五二年创全国凿井最高纪录的先进工作者王开成，表示坚决完成光荣的建井任务，努力学习苏联先进经验，保证工程作到好、省、快和安全。
    谢家集二号竖井是我国设计人员在苏联专家帮助下自己设计的第一对现代化竖井。这个矿井建成后，将使淮南矿务局的年产煤量比今年的产煤量增加三分之一。这些煤并可以提炼出大量的焦炭，供应我国另一个钢铁基地大冶的需要。根据设计要求，这对竖井除了极小部分以外，整个生产过程都将由机械来代替人力。井内并将设有各种现代化的防火、防水和通风的安全设备。井上将建筑设有太阳灯室等的三层高的行政福利联合大楼。
    这对竖井的建设得到了各方面的大力支援。在开工前的准备时期中，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及东北，天津，上海等地供应了大批建井用的各种机器设备。东北派来了六十多个建井的技术工人。谢家集附近的农民们，组织了一百多辆牛车，为新井建设运输材料。在大雪纷飞和阴雨连绵的日子里，工人们仍坚持工地上的工作，保证了工程的按期开工。（新华社）
