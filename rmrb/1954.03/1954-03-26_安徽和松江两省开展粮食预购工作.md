Anhui and Songjiang Provinces Launch Grain Pre-Purchase Work

　　The Anhui Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau and the Anhui Provincial Cooperative General Agency signed an agreement, entrusting the cooperatives to pre-purchase wheat. Farmers who pre-sell wheat generally receive a batch of deposits, which can be used to develop agricultural production and overcome the difficulties of spring production and life. The farmers in the areas where pre-purchase has already started have responded very well. Jin Renyi, a farmer in Jiangxin Island, Huaining County, said: "Now the state is carrying out pre-purchase to support our production, it is really like sending charcoal in the snow!" Zhu Yan's mutual aid group plans to use the pre-purchase deposit to buy a cow and invest it in spring farming production. (Cheng Hua)

　　The Songjiang Provincial People's Government Finance and Economics Committee and the Grain Bureau recently made arrangements to carry out grain pre-purchase work. The main targets of the pre-purchase are agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and households with production difficulties. Regulations have also been made regarding the proportion of advance deposits, the methods for supply and marketing cooperatives to conduct pre-purchase work on behalf of the state, etc. At a recent grain work conference, the Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau emphasized that publicity and education work should be done well in the pre-purchase, the principle of voluntariness should be implemented, and practices such as averaging and apportionment should be prevented.

    安徽和松江两省开展粮食预购工作
    安徽省人民政府粮食厅和安徽省合作总社签订协议，委托合作社预购小麦。预售小麦的农民一般都能得到一批订金，可以用来发展农业生产和克服春季生产和生活中的困难。已经开始预购的地区，农民反映很好。怀宁县江心洲农民金仁义说：“现在国家进行预购，支持我们生产，真是雪里送炭！”朱延高互助组准备拿预购订金买一头牛，投入春耕生产。　（程华）
    松江省人民政府财政经济委员会和粮食厅最近布置开展粮食预购工作。预购的主要对象是农业生产合作社、互助组以及生产有困难的户。对于预付订金的比例、供销合作社代国家进行预购工作的办法等，也都作了规定。省人民政府粮食厅在最近召开的粮食工作会议上，强调预购中要作好宣传教育工作，贯彻自愿原则，防止平均摊派等作法。
