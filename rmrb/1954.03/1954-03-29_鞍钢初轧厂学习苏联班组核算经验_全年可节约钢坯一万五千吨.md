Anshan Iron and Steel's Primary Rolling Mill Learns from the Soviet Union's Experience in Team Cost Accounting: Annual Savings of 15,000 Tons of Steel Billet Possible

During the 1953 increase production and practice economy movement, the Anshan Iron and Steel's Primary Rolling Mill adopted measures such as "fixed-length steel cutting" and "recycling high-quality steel cut-offs to be remanufactured into agricultural tool steel." These measures reduced the large amount of "end loss" (averaging about 1,200 to 1,400 tons per month) that had long existed in the factory's production by about 50%.

Beginning March 1st of this year, the factory's Economic Accounting Section learned from the advanced experience of the heavy rail steel beam workshop at the Petrovsky Metallurgical Plant and the wheel rolling workshop at the Liebknecht Steel Pipe Plant in the Soviet Union. It implemented "team cost accounting" in the steel rolling section. Based on the specific conditions and existing problems within the factory, the following three main indicators were established: number of steel blocks rolled, savings in steel ingots, and recovery of large-end steel cut-offs. Accounting was done by team, and the production results of the three shifts were announced daily.

This initiative was supported by the factory's Party General Branch, the Trade Union, and the administrative departments. It was mobilized among the masses at a general meeting, and a three-shift competition was launched. By early March, the C shift had achieved the best results, completely eliminating "end loss," exceeding the state plan quota, and saving a large amount of steel ingots. The cut-off recovery rate reached 94%, saving the state over 220 million yuan. The A and B shifts performed relatively poorly, still experiencing some loss, with recovery rates only reaching 80%-74%. The A shift quickly caught up, and on the 11th and 12th, the shift successively overfulfilled the state's rolling output plan. The B shift also had high production enthusiasm and eliminated "end loss" on the 12th, overfulfilling the rolling output plan. As of the 17th, the Primary Rolling Mill had comprehensively eliminated the "end loss" that had long existed for several years, and the recovery rate had significantly improved. The cut-off recovery rate of all three shifts reached 100%. In just 17 days, the mill saved the state over 2 billion yuan.

The elimination of "end loss" by the Primary Rolling Mill will save the state 15,000 tons of steel billet annually (compared to last year's production level), reducing costs by 22.5 billion yuan.

    鞍钢初轧厂学习苏联班组核算经验
    全年可节约钢坯一万五千吨
    鞍钢初轧厂在一九五三年增产节约运动中，由于采取了“定尺切钢”及“回收优质钢切头改制农具钢”等项措施，使该厂过去生产中长期存在的大量“无头损失”（每月平均约有一千二百吨到一千四百吨）减少了百分之五十左右。
    本年三月一日起，该厂经济核算科学习苏联彼得罗夫斯基冶金工厂重轨钢梁车间和里伯克涅赫塔钢管厂车轮轧制车间的先进经验，在轧钢工段推行了“班组核算账”，根据厂内具体情况及存在的问题制订出以下三项主要指标：轧钢块数，节约钢锭，回收大头钢切头，并按班核算，逐日公布三班生产成果。
    这一创举得到该厂党总支、工会及行政方面的支持，在大会上向群众动员，发起三班竞赛。到三月上旬，丙班成绩最好，已经完全作到消灭了“无头损失”，并超过国家计划定额，节约了大量钢锭，切头回收率达到百分之九十四，给国家节约了资金两亿二千余万元。甲乙两班比较差，仍有少许损失，回收率仅达百分之八十——七十四。甲班急起直追，到十一日、十二日该班连续超额完成了国家轧出量计划。乙班生产热情也很高，于十二日消灭了“无头损失”。并超额完成了轧出量计划。截至十七日止，初轧厂已全面消灭了几年来长期存在的“无头损失”，收得率有了显著的提高，三班切头回收率都达到百分之百，在短短十七天内，共给国家节约了资金二十多亿元。
    初轧厂消灭“无头损失”的结果每年可给国家节约钢坯一万五千吨（和去年生产水平相比），降低成本二百二十五亿元。
