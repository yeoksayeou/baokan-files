Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: According to TASS, at the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, G. Zhankov, delivered a report at the morning session on March 1st regarding the instructions of the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on the development of the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957).

Zhankov began by saying that the Second Five-Year Plan stipulates the continued construction of socialism in the country, ensuring the further vigorous development of the decisive sectors of the national economy, and greatly improving the living standards and welfare of the working people.

Zhankov then discussed the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). He pointed out that the First Five-Year Plan was basically completed ahead of schedule in four years. By 1952, the total value of industrial production had increased to more than 2.2 times that of 1948, or more than four times that of 1939. The main task of the First Five-Year Plan—to build the foundation of a socialist society in the country—had been completed. However, the speed of agricultural development in the plan still lagged behind the speed of industrial development, and the development of industry was also somewhat uneven; the production of electricity and coal did not keep up with the needs of the national economy.

When discussing the basic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan, Zhankov said that investment in the national economy under the Second Five-Year Plan would increase to about twice the amount invested in the four years of the First Five-Year Plan. Compared with the First Five-Year Plan, investment in agriculture will increase by more than 2.3 times, industry will increase by about two times (of which light industry and the food industry will increase by 2.4 times), transportation and postal services will increase by about 1.4 times, culture, education, health, and public utilities will increase by about 2.8 times, and residential construction will increase by about 3.7 times.

By 1957, the level of industrial production should be 60 percent higher than in 1952, and the total value of industrial production will account for about 56.4 percent of the total national economic production value, with agriculture accounting for 26.6 percent. In 1957, electricity production will be twice that of 1952, and coal will be 1.89 times. One of the main tasks of industry is to develop the iron and steel industry and the non-ferrous metal smelting industry. By the time this Five-Year Plan is completed, the production of lead and zinc will be able to fully meet the needs of the country, and the production of iron and steel will be able to meet about 30 to 40 percent of the country's needs. In 1957, the total value of production of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries will increase by about 1.82 times that of 1952, the electrical industry will increase by 2.5 times, chemical products will increase by 1.9 times, and the production of building materials will increase by at least 1.8 times.

The textile industry's products in 1957 will increase by 53 percent compared with 1952, furniture will increase by 120 percent, and rubber will increase by 90 percent. The food industry's products in 1957 will increase by 50 percent compared with 1952. The output of sugar will increase by 150 percent in five years, canned vegetables will increase by 97 percent, meat will increase by 86 percent, and vegetable oil will increase by 55 percent.

Zhankov then discussed the task of eliminating the phenomenon of agriculture lagging behind industrial development and failing to adapt to national needs. He said that in order to greatly increase the total output of agriculture and the output of agricultural commodities, it is necessary to ensure higher and more reliable harvests in crop cultivation, and to ensure an increase in the number of livestock and the productivity of their products in animal husbandry. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the total harvest of wheat should be about 14 percent higher than in 1952. Grain for feed should increase by at least 80 percent, raw cotton production should increase by more than four times, sugar beets should increase by 2.8 times, and tobacco should increase by more than two times. The plan calls for greatly increasing the level of mechanization of field work, and the total number of tractors in the country will increase to 23,000 (each with 15 horsepower), and combine harvesters will increase to more than 5,000. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the number of cattle is planned to increase to 2.1 million (of which dairy cows will increase to 700,000), pigs will increase to 2.2 million, and sheep and goats will increase to 9.7 million.

In the Second Five-Year Plan, transportation and communications will also be greatly developed. On the basis of continuously improving industrial and agricultural production and continuously reducing prices, the retail commodity turnover in 1957 should increase by at least 70 percent compared with 1952.

Zhankov also discussed the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan in healthcare, education, the development of science, the training of cadres, and foreign trade. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the volume of exports should increase by 1.7 times, and the volume of imports should increase by 1.6 times. Bulgaria will further expand its comprehensive cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the national income will increase by about 50 percent, and the real wages of workers and the real income of peasants will increase by at least 40 percent. In order to improve the living conditions of workers, the construction area of housing built solely with state funding will be more than 2.2 million square meters.

Zhankov concluded by saying that the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan will further consolidate the alliance of workers and peasants and the people's democratic system in the country, bring new prosperity to the country's economy and culture, and improve the material and cultural conditions of the working people. At the same time, this will be a new contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: According to TASS, the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party continued to be held on March 1st.

At the morning session, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, G. Zhankov, made a report on the third item on the agenda (supplementary agenda of the congress): the instructions of the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on the development of the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

After listening to the above report, the delegates to the congress launched a heated discussion on the report.

    在保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会上
    詹科夫作第二个五年计划的报告
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记格·詹科夫在第六次党代表大会三月一日上午会议上，作了保共第六次党代表大会对发展第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）的指示的报告。
    詹科夫首先说：第二个五年计划规定在我国继续建设社会主义，保证进一步大力发展国民经济中有决定意义的部门，并大大增进劳动人民的生活福利。
    詹科夫接着谈到了第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）的执行情况。他指出，第一个五年计划基本上是提前在四年中完成的。一九五二年，工业生产总额已增为一九四八年的二点二倍以上，或一九三九年的四倍以上。第一个五年计划的主要任务——在我国建设社会主义社会的基础——已经完成。但是，计划中农业发展的速度仍落后于工业发展的速度，工业的发展也有些不均衡，电力和煤的生产就没有赶上国民经济的需要。
    詹科夫在谈到第二个五年计划的基本任务时说：第二个五年计划对国民经济的投资约将增为第一个五年计划的四年投资的两倍左右。和第一个五年计划相比，农业投资增为二点三倍以上，工业约增为两倍（其中轻工业和食品工业增为二点四倍），运输邮电约增为一点四倍，文教卫生和公用事业约增为二点八倍，住宅建筑约增为三点七倍。
    到一九五七年，工业生产水平要比一九五二年提高百分之六十，工业生产总值约将占全部国民经济生产总值的百分之五十六点四，农业占百分之二十六点六。一九五七年的电力生产量将为一九五二年的两倍，煤将为一点八九倍。工业的主要任务之一，是发展钢铁工业和有色金属冶炼工业。到这个五年计划完成时，铅和锌的生产将能完全满足国家的需要，钢铁的生产将能满足全国需要的百分之三十到四十左右。一九五七年机器制造和金属加工工业的生产总额约将增为一九五二年的一点八二倍，电气工业增为二点五倍，化学工业品增为一点九倍，建筑材料的生产至少增为一点八倍。
    一九五七年的纺织工业产品将比一九五二年增加百分之五十三，家具增加百分之一百二十，橡皮增加百分之九十。一九五七年的食品工业产品将比一九五二年增多百分之五十。五年中食糖的产量将增加百分之一百五十，蔬菜罐头增加百分之九十七，肉类增加百分之八十六，植物油增加百分之五十五。
    詹科夫接着谈到了消除农业落后于工业发展和不适应全国需要的现象的任务。他说：为了大量增加农业总产量和农业商品产量，在作物种植方面必须保证有更高的和更可靠的收获量，在饲畜业方面必须保证增加牲畜头数及其产品生产率。到第二个五年计划结束时，小麦的总收获量要比一九五二年提高约百分之十四。饲料用谷物至少提高百分之八十，原棉生产要增为四倍以上，甜菜增为二点八倍，烟草增为二倍以上。计划要大大提高田间工作的机械化水平，全国的拖拉机总数将增为二万三千台（每台以十五匹马力计算），联合机增为五千余台。到五年计划结束时，牛的头数计划增加到二百一十万头（其中乳牛增为七十万头），猪增为二百二十万口，绵羊和山羊增为九百七十万只。
    在第二个五年计划中，运输和交通事业也将获得很大的发展。在不断提高工农业生产和连续降低物价的基础上，一九五七年的零售商品流转额至少要比一九五二年提高百分之七十。
    詹科夫还谈到了第二个五年计划在保健、教育、发展科学、培养干部以及对外贸易等方面的任务。在第二个五年计划期间，货物出口量应增为一点七倍，进口量应增为一点六倍。保加利亚将进一步扩大和苏联及各人民民主国家的全面合作。
    到第二个五年计划结束时，国民收入约增加百分之五十，职工的实际工资和农民的实际收入至少增加百分之四十。为改善职工的居住条件，单是由国家拨款修建的住宅，建筑面积就在二百二十万平方公尺以上。
    詹科夫最后说：完成第二个五年计划，就可以进一步巩固我国工农联盟和人民民主制度，使我国经济上和文化上获得新的繁荣，并改善劳动人民的物质和文化状况。同时，这将是我国在各国人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中的新贡献。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会三月一日继续举行。
    在上午会议上，保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记格·詹科夫就第三项议程（大会补充议程）做了保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会对发展保加利亚人民共和国第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）的指示的报告。
