Xinhua News Agency Commentator Jiang Nan comments on the U.S. obstruction of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, saying that people all over the world hope that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference, especially the major powers bearing primary responsibility, will first proceed from the interests of consolidating peace and resolve the Korean issue through consultation. This would allow the Korean armistice to transition into a consolidated peace and ease the tense situation in Asia and internationally. Second, the participating countries should respect the rights and interests of the Korean people so that they can enjoy full democracy and freedom, thereby establishing a democratic, unified, and independent Korea based on their own resolution of their own problems without any foreign interference. Obviously, this aspiration of people all over the world is entirely legitimate and reasonable. If the countries participating in the conference, especially the major powers, sincerely seek a solution to the Korean problem without any other objectives, they cannot ignore this aspiration.

However, the actions of the U.S. ruling clique since the end of the Berlin Conference have run counter to this sincere aspiration of people all over the world.

In order to create a tense atmosphere unfavorable to peaceful negotiations and obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue, the U.S. ruling clique has intensified the creation of incidents violating the Korean Armistice Agreement in Korea, illegally transporting large quantities of reinforcing weapons and aircraft into South Korea, and striving to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice. On the other hand, they are stepping up the expansion and reorganization of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, increasing Syngman Rhee's capital for taking risks. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee gang is also clamoring to "resist" the conference, insisting on adding various restrictions to the conference aimed at facilitating sabotage, and clamoring to "march north" ninety days after the conference convenes. The Rhee gang also arrogantly suggested sending Rhee's puppet troops to Indochina to fight the Vietnamese people, and planned to convene a conference in Seoul on April 26, the same day the Geneva Conference opened, including scum like Chiang Kai-shek and Bao Dai. However, as the American proverb says, "He who pays the piper calls the tune." Everyone knows that these actions of the Syngman Rhee puppet are in line with the wishes of its American master. Aren't these actions of the U.S. ruling clique enough to show their true intention of not wanting to peacefully negotiate a solution to the Korean problem?

Similarly, the U.S. ruling clique is not concerned with helping the Korean people restore unity and independence on a democratic basis, but is attempting to continue to place the southern half of Korea under their control as their military base and colony. Since the end of the Berlin Conference, U.S. officials and generals have openly stated that if the U.S.'s unilaterally proposed conditions for so-called "unified" Korea are not accepted at the Geneva Conference, Korea will only remain divided indefinitely. However, even these people themselves make no secret of the fact that the conditions put forward by the United States are to establish their hand-picked puppet Syngman Rhee's dictatorial rule throughout Korea. This U.S. conspiracy can be further proven by its recent ratification of the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed with Syngman Rhee. This treaty is a military alliance in preparation for war. According to this treaty, the United States has obtained the right to station troops indefinitely on South Korean territory, making South Korea forever a U.S. colony and military base. At the same time, the United States can use the excuse of "being attacked" to drag South Korea into war and drive the South Korean people to serve as cannon fodder in order to realize its consistent conspiracy of "Asians fighting Asians."

It is quite obvious that the attitude adopted by the U.S. ruling clique on the Korean issue is completely contrary to the wishes and interests of the Korean people and the people of the world. If they are unwilling to abandon this attitude, they will be justly judged by world public opinion and peace-loving people at the upcoming Geneva Conference.

    评美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋活动
    【新华社二十三日讯】本社评论员江南评论美国阻挠在日内瓦会议上和平解决朝鲜问题的活动说，全世界人民希望参加日内瓦会议的各国，尤其是负有主要责任的各大国首先从巩固和平的利益出发，以协商方式解决朝鲜问题，使得朝鲜停战转入巩固的和平，亚洲和国际紧张局势趋于缓和。其次，参加会议的各国尊重朝鲜人民的权利和利益，使得他们能够享受充分的民主和自由，从而在自己解决自己问题而不受任何外国干涉的基础上建立一个民主的、统一的和独立的朝鲜。很显然，全世界人民的这种愿望是十分正当和合理的，参加会议的各国，尤其是各大国，如果真心诚意谋求朝鲜问题的解决而不抱有其他目的，对这种愿望是不能置之不理的。
    但是，美国统治集团自柏林会议结束以来的所作所为是与全世界人民这种真诚的愿望背道而驰的。
    为了制造不利于和平协商的紧张气氛和阻挠朝鲜问题的解决，美国统治集团在朝鲜一方面加紧制造违反朝鲜停战协定的事件，把大批增援性的武器和飞机非法运入南朝鲜，力图保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态；另一方面加紧扩充和整顿李承晚伪军，增加李承晚进行冒险的资本。同时，李承晚匪帮也大吵大嚷要“抵制”会议，硬要给会议加上种种旨在便于进行破坏的限制，并且叫嚣在会议召开的九十天以后“向北进军”。李匪帮还曾狂妄地建议派李伪军到印度支那去与越南人民作战，并且准备在四月二十六日日内瓦会议开幕的同一天，在汉城召开包括蒋介石、保大之类渣滓的会议。但是，美国的谚语说得好，“谁付钱给吹笛者，谁就可以叫他吹笛子。”谁都知道，李承晚傀儡的这些行动是投合它的美国主人的心意的。美国统治集团的这些行动，难道还不足以说明他们不愿和平协商解决朝鲜问题的真实意图吗？
    同样，美国统治集团关心的不是帮助朝鲜人民在民主的基础上恢复统一和独立，而是企图继续置朝鲜的南半部于它们的控制之下，作为它们的军事基地和殖民地。自柏林会议结束以来，美国官员和将军们就公开声称，如果在日内瓦会议上不接受美国片面提出的所谓“统一”朝鲜的条件，朝鲜只有无限期地分裂下去。然而，连这些人自己也毫不加以隐讳，美国提出的这些条件是要在全朝鲜建立它们一手扶植起来的傀儡李承晚的独裁统治。美国的这个阴谋还可以从它在最近批准与李承晚签订的所谓“共同防御条约”得到进一步证明。这个条约是准备战争的军事同盟。根据这个条约，美国取得在南朝鲜领土上无限期驻兵的权利，使得南朝鲜永远沦为美国的殖民地和军事基地。同时，美国可以借口“遭受进攻”而把南朝鲜拖入战争，驱使南朝鲜人民充当炮灰，以实现其“亚洲人打亚洲人”的一贯阴谋。
    十分明显，美国统治集团在朝鲜问题上所采取的态度，是完全违反朝鲜人民和全世界人民的愿望和利益的。如果他们不愿放弃这种态度，那么他们在即将到来的日内瓦会议上将要受到世界公正舆论与爱好和平人民的公正的审判。
