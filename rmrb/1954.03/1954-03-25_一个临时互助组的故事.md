    The Story of a Temporary Mutual Aid Team
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
  I. Zhu Guanglian, the Deputy Township Head of Heshang Township in Echeng County, Hubei Province, organized a mutual aid team of seven households in the Zhu-Liu-Chen natural village. Comrade Zhang, a district cadre, was sent to help them improve the work of the mutual aid team. Comrade Zhang was young and enthusiastic, and in a short time, he learned about the overall situation of the mutual aid team. However, these situations made him unsatisfied: first, the whole team had only seven households, the scale was too small; second, it was a temporary mutual aid team, and there was no system in the team, "mutual" for a while, then stopped for a while… "Undoubtedly," he thought, "what leadership content can there be in such a mutual aid team!"
    Comrade Zhang came from the district and knew that the most important part of the current mutual aid and cooperation movement was to improve the mutual aid teams one step further. Based on this spirit, he began to improve the work of the mutual aid team.
    "What is mutual aid?" He educated the team members on organization: "Three or two households, mutual for a while, stop for a while, that's not mutual aid; mutual aid must be mutual in everything, comprehensive mutual, long-term mutual; mutual aid must also have work evaluation and scorekeeping, production plans, labor discipline, criticism and self-criticism..."
    Everyone felt heavy in their hearts after hearing Comrade Zhang's words. They remembered that the original purpose of organizing the mutual aid team was to "seize the fire," such as transplanting rice seedlings, irrigating, and harvesting, which were all urgent tasks. It was difficult for one person to take care of them. With mutual aid, more people meant more power, and the problem could be solved. As for the small tasks on weekdays, if each person could handle them, there was no need to force it.
    However, according to the requirements Comrade Zhang made for the mutual aid team, such mutual aid was obviously not right.
    "If mutual aid has so many troublesome regulations, it would tie people too tightly, I won't do it," said Zhu Guangbin, the deputy leader.
    "I won't do it either," some team members echoed.
    Team leader Zhu Guanglian was very anxious. He thought that it was now the busy spring plowing season, what would happen if the mutual aid team broke up?
      "Our mutual aid team doesn't need to break up!" He thought for a moment and said firmly, "Let's think of a way to cope with the cadres, and we can still have mutual aid." So he told everyone how to cope with the cadres: do mutual aid openly according to what the cadres said, but secretly everything remains the same. Everyone agreed to this method.
    This method really got Comrade Zhang through, but after a long time, Comrade Zhang discovered that what the team members did was different from what they reported. He was angry, and he announced to the team members emotionally:
    "What you are doing is not mutual aid, it's collapsing!"
    Since then, the mutual aid team broke up. This was in the spring of 1953. II. Time passed quickly. District cadre Comrade Zhang was replaced by Comrade Wang in Heshang Township. In the past, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Heshang Township had resulted in the collapse of many mutual aid teams due to great speeding and blindly upgrading mutual aid teams. Now Comrade Wang's task is to restore the mutual aid teams. The backbone of the Zhu Guanglian mutual aid team was numerous (including the deputy township head, members of the township government, and militia), so Comrade Wang decided to focus on restoring this mutual aid team as a key experiment.
    Comrade Wang was a new cadre who had just started working in this area, and he didn't know anyone or understand the situation. After arriving in the village, the first step was to understand the reason for the breakup of the Zhu Guanglian mutual aid team. However, the masses were not interested when they heard that Comrade Wang was here to work on mutual aid teams. Some people gossiped behind their backs, and some people took evasive measures. For many days, Comrade Wang was unable to find out the reason for the breakup of the mutual aid team, and he couldn't even see the team leader Zhu Guanglian.
    Since Zhu Guanglian learned that Comrade Wang was here to restore the mutual aid team, he felt very uneasy, thinking: "Comrade Zhang came from the district in the past, and now Comrade Wang also comes from the district. Comrade Wang's requirements for organizing mutual aid teams must be the same as Comrade Zhang's; and if a mutual aid team is set up, my position as team leader may not be able to escape, but can the team leader continue to be?" Thinking of this, all the unpleasant things he encountered in the past when leading the mutual aid team could not help but flood into his mind... "Never do this stupid thing again!" he said to himself:
  "Otherwise, as long as it doesn't suit the cadres' minds, they will announce again, 'What you are doing is not mutual aid, it's collapsing.'"
    One day, Comrade Wang went to Zhu Guanglian's home, and Zhu Guanglian was very unhappy. "Here comes the trouble again, but this time no one can find my trouble." Thinking this way, when he heard Comrade Wang mention the issue of mutual aid, he said nothing, only answering coldly:
    "Mutual aid is not easy to do!"
      "Why?"
   "Why!" Zhu Guanglian said angrily, "Because everyone feels that mutual aid is not beneficial: first, there are too many meetings, which delays production; second, when helping someone with mutual aid, that person has to provide meals and compete to eat good food, which is too wasteful; third, some people are unwilling to settle accounts." He deliberately described the past mutual aid as full of shortcomings.
    The conversation was inconclusive. Comrade Wang went to other team members. But when they mentioned mutual aid, they also, like the team leader, described the past mutual aid as a complete mess, advocating that it was unnecessary to restore it.
    Comrade Wang couldn't grasp the real situation of the mutual aid team, and the work didn't progress well. III. July and August are the season for harvesting early rice, transplanting late rice, and weeding cotton fields, a busy time for three things. Team member Chen Xiuming fell ill in bed, and he couldn't hire anyone to help harvest four mu of early rice. Zhu Guangdeng planned to harvest early rice, but he was afraid that two mu of cotton fields would be abandoned without weeding, and two ridges of late rice were budding and earing, but they encountered drought and had to irrigate. Zhu Guanglian and others also felt that there was a shortage of labor, and they couldn't take care of everything, which really made them anxious. They remembered that they had encountered similar busy situations in the past during spring plowing, but at that time the mutual aid team had not broken up, and everyone relied on it to solve many difficult problems; and because mutual aid work was faster, the entire team of seven households saved more than a hundred workdays, and used this surplus labor to return from the lake with more than a hundred loads of aquatic plants for top dressing fertilizer. Recalling all this, they felt that although they had unanimously opposed Comrade Wang's restoration of the mutual aid team during this period, it was indeed difficult to get through this busy farming season without a mutual aid team.
    On a sultry night, individual farmer Zhu Guangzhong was enjoying the cool air outside his house. Suddenly, he saw Zhu Guanglian, Zhu Guangdeng, and Zhu Guangbin squatting not far away, talking. He quietly walked over, only to hear them talking in very low voices: "There are all kinds of jobs to be done, what should we do!" "There is no good way except to organize a mutual aid team." "But what kind of mutual aid team should we organize? No one is willing to do the kind of mutual aid team that the cadres required in the past; Comrade Wang will probably not recognize our original temporary mutual aid team as mutual aid, just like the cadres in the past..." After a bag of tobacco of silence, he continued: "Let's still organize our original temporary mutual aid team, do it secretly, don't let Comrade Wang know, and he won't be able to interfere with our affairs."
    Individual farmer Zhu Guangzhong originally didn't pay much attention to the affairs of the mutual aid team. But he had a good impression of Comrade Wang: because Comrade Wang was friendly and approachable, the cadres who came to work on mutual aid teams in the past looked down on individual farmers, but now Comrade Wang often approached and chatted with him. At the same time, Comrade Wang saw that the masses were too busy, and he often helped people, such as carrying water, cutting grass, and going to the fields... For the sake of the masses, he did not care about his fragile body, he was really a good cadre. Thinking of this, Zhu Guangzhong felt that he should tell Comrade Wang about Zhu Guanglian's plan to secretly organize a mutual aid team to help him understand the situation. So he went to Comrade Wang with excitement. IV.
    After listening to Zhu Guangzhong's report, Comrade Wang fully understood the difficulties in restoring the mutual aid team during this period. He sincerely thanked Zhu Guangzhong for his help. In response to this situation, he redeployed his work.
    In the evening, Comrade Wang went to the home of team member Zhu Guangdeng. He often came here and was more familiar with them. It's just that Zhu Guangdeng, like other team members, was not very willing to talk about the issue of mutual aid, so they usually talked about other things, but today Comrade Wang's words were a bit different. He said:
    "I heard that the rice is about to be harvested, can you manage it?"
    "I can't manage it!" Zhu Guangdeng replied.
    "What should we do, do we need mutual aid?"
    Zhu Guangdeng was stunned, thinking that their secret discussion about mutual aid had been discovered. Before he could speak, he heard Comrade Wang continue casually:
      "Mutual aid can solve difficulties. The government's mutual aid policy starts from the demands of the masses. That is to say, the masses recognize which kind of mutual aid is good, then they should do that kind of mutual aid."
    Zhu Guangdeng felt slightly relieved and listened attentively. At this time, Comrade Wang raised his voice and said:
    "Some cadres in the past did not start from the demands of the masses, but insisted on engaging in advanced mutual aid teams, and looked down on temporary mutual aid teams, not recognizing them as mutual aid, which is wrong."
      "So, there was nothing wrong with our temporary mutual aid team in the past!" Zhu Guangdeng excitedly grabbed Comrade Wang's hand.
      "Of course there was nothing wrong!" Comrade Wang replied affirmatively. "So, now you don't need to discuss secret mutual aid there."
    Zhu Guangdeng was a little embarrassed, but very happy in his heart. He pondered for a moment and said, "Since Comrade Wang knows our situation, I will tell you everything that happened before and after." So he told the story of how the mutual aid team broke up in the past, how they felt uneasy when Comrade Wang came to restore the mutual aid team this time, and how they had to plan secret mutual aid. They talked until late at night. V.
    The next day, Zhu Guangdeng told the team members what happened last night. Everyone was excited to say: It turns out that Comrade Wang's requirements for mutual aid are different from Comrade Zhang's… Now we can have open mutual aid.
    Immediately, they proposed: Zhu Guanglian and Zhu Guangbin will still serve as the team leader and deputy leader, and the method of mutual aid will be the same as in the past. Comrade Wang thought about the method of mutual aid for a while, and said:
    "Basically, do it the same way as in the past; but everyone can consider whether there are still inappropriate places in the past mutual aid."
    Comrade Wang's words attracted everyone's attention. Some team members said: Although the past mutual aid had achievements: fast work, labor savings, etc., there were also shortcomings: everyone provided meals and competed to eat good food, which was too wasteful; women's participation in labor was not counted as "points," which was also unreasonable; and sometimes accounts were not settled in time. These shortcomings must be removed. Everyone agreed with this opinion.
    The mutual aid team was up and running again. They smoothly passed the busy farming season of July and August.
    One evening, Comrade Wang helped the mutual aid team summarize the work of this period. Everyone felt that the work achievements during this period were great. After women's labor was changed from not counting points to counting points, they all actively worked. More than 30 men and women in the whole team went to the fields, not only seizing the fire in harvesting rice, weeding, etc., but also harvesting lake grass (used as fertilizer), and carrying manure to the late rice fields. Harvesting rice saved twelve workdays, and selling labor earned 150,000 yuan; after changing the meals from competing to eat good food to home-style meals, each household saved at least 50,000 yuan, and the entire team of seven households saved at least 350,000 yuan; Chen Xiuming especially felt that this mutual aid was of great benefit to him. He said: "I was sick, and I couldn't hire anyone to harvest rice. If it weren't for the restoration of the mutual aid team, I, this patient, would have been worried to death."
    After the team members talked about the achievements of mutual aid, Comrade Wang said:
   "According to everyone, the reason why our mutual aid this time has achievements is inseparable from the improvement of the mutual aid method, but everyone knows that our mutual aid team is based on the old habits of the past, and today's improvement is just a beginning, and we must continue to improve!"
    Everyone felt that Comrade Wang's words made sense, and they put forward many constructive opinions on future mutual aid: Some people said that work evaluation should not be uniformly counted as ten points, but should be calculated according to the strength of labor and the length of labor time, and democratic management must be promoted in scheduling work to achieve fairness and rationality; some people said that before the arrival of an agricultural season, a production plan should be drawn up so that work can be done step by step; some people said that after an agricultural season, not only should the work of the entire team be summarized, but also the advantages and disadvantages of each person should be summarized to help everyone progress; some people said that for the convenience of labor, long-term mutual aid should be tried…
    The night was late. Although everyone was a little tired, they were very happy in their hearts; because everyone saw a harvest in the conversation: summarizing the achievements of mutual aid and putting forward methods for improving mutual aid will improve the mutual aid team one step further.

    一个临时互助组的故事
    本报记者  古维进
  一湖北省鄂城县和尚乡副乡长朱光连在朱刘陈自然村组织了一个共有七户的互助组。区干部张同志被派来帮助他们搞好互助组的工作。张同志年轻，热情，在一个很短的时间里就了解到互助组的全面情况，然而这些情况使他不大满意：第一，全组只有七户，规模太小；第二，是一个临时互助组，组里没有什么制度，“互”一阵停一阵……“无疑的，”他想：“像这样的互助组有什么领导内容呢！”
    张同志从区里下来，知道目前开展互助合作运动中，把互助组提高一步是最重要的一环。根据这个精神，他开始进行提高互助组的工作。
    “什么叫互助？”他给组员进行组织起来的教育：“三家两户，互一阵停一阵，不算互助；互助必须事事互，全面互，长期互；互助还要有评工记分，有生产计划，有劳作纪律，有批评与自我批评……”
    大家听了张同志的话，心里沉甸甸的。他们记得，当初组织互助组是为了“抢火色”，例如插秧、车水、收割等都是时间急迫的大件活，一个人是很难照顾过来的，进行了互助，人多力量大，就可以解决问题。至于平日的小活儿，各人能干得了的，就不必勉强。
    但是，现在根据张同志对互助组所提的那些要求，这样的互助显然不对头了。
    “如果说，互助要有那么多麻烦的规定，那就把人捆得太死了，我不干。”副组长朱光斌说。
    “我也不干。”一些组员附和说。
    组长朱光连心里很焦急。他想到现在正是农忙的春耕季节，如果互助组散了伙，可怎么办？
      “我们的互助组用不着散伙！”他想了一想，坚决地说：“我们想个办法把干部应付过去，仍然可以互助的。”于是他告诉大家应付干部的办法：明里照着干部说的那一套进行互助，暗里还是一切照旧。大家都同意这个办法。
    这个办法果然把张同志应付过去了，但是日子久了，张同志发现组员所做的和汇报的不一样，他生气了，他情绪激动地给组员宣布说：
    “你们这样搞不算互助，垮台了！”
    从此互助组散了伙。这是一九五三年春天的事情。二时间很快过去了。在和尚乡工作的区干部由张同志换来王同志。过去和尚乡开展互助合作运动由于大?大轰和盲目提高互助组的结果，有许多互助组垮了台。现在王同志的任务是来恢复互助组的。朱光连互助组的骨干很多（有副乡长、乡政府委员和民兵等），王同志决定以恢复这个互助组为重点试验。
    王同志是才到本区工作的新干部，不认识人也不摸情况，到了村子后，第一步需要了解朱光连互助组散伙的情况。但是群众听说王同志来搞互助组都不感兴趣。有的人背地说风凉话，有的人采取逃避办法。有好些天，王同志都没法了解到互助组散伙的原因，甚至连组长朱光连的面都见不到。
    朱光连自从知道王同志来恢复互助组，心里很不安，寻思道：“过去张同志是从区里来的，现在王同志也是从区里来的，王同志对于组织互助组的要求，当然和张同志的要求是一个样的；而搞起了互助组，自己这个组长的职位恐怕也跑不了，可是组长还能当下去吗？”他寻思到这里，过去领导互助组遇到的一切不愉快的事情不由得都涌上心头……“决不能再干这傻瓜的事情！”他自言自语地说：
  “要不然的话，只要一点不合干部的心思，他们又要宣布说‘你们这样搞不算互助，垮台了。’”
    一天，王同志到了朱光连家里，朱光连很不高兴。“又来找麻烦了，可是这一次谁都找不到我的麻烦的。”他这样想着，听到王同志提起互助的问题时，他什么都不说，只冷淡地答了一句：
    “互助不好搞！”
      “为什么？”
   “为什么！”朱光连气鼓鼓地说：“因为大家感到互助没有好处：第一，开会多，耽误了生产；第二，替谁互助时，谁得管饭而且要比赛吃好的，这样浪费太大；第三，有的人不愿意清账。”他故意把过去的互助说成净是缺点。
    谈话没有结果。王同志找其他的组员去。但是他们提起互助，也和组长一样把过去的互助净说成一团糟，主张不必恢复。
    王同志掌握不到互助组的真实情况，工作不好进展。三七八月间，是割早谷、插晚秧、棉花地薅草三头忙的季节。组员陈修明病倒在床上，四亩田的早谷雇不到人帮助收割。朱光登打算去割早谷，又怕两亩棉花地没有薅草荒掉，而两丘田的晚谷正在打苞出穗，却遇到天旱还要去车水。朱光连等也感到劳动力不足，顾得这头顾不到那头，真是把他们急坏了。他们记得，过去春耕也曾经碰到类似这样忙碌的情形，但是那时互助组还没有散伙，大家依靠它把许多困难问题都解决了；而且由于互助做活来得快，全组七户共节省了一百多个人工，利用这些剩余劳力曾到湖里打回一百多担顶肥用的水草。他们想起这一切，觉得这个期间虽然一致反对王同志恢复互助组，而当前没有互助组又确实很难度过这农忙季节的关口。
    在一个天气闷热的晚上，单干农民朱光忠在屋外乘凉。忽然看见朱光连、朱光登、朱光斌三个人蹲在不远的地方谈话。他悄悄地走过去，只听得他们声音放得很低的谈着：“各种活儿都要忙，可怎么办呀！”“除了搞互助组没有好的办法。”“可是搞什么样的互助组？搞过去干部要求的那种互助组，谁都不愿意干的；搞我们原来的临时互助组，王同志恐怕又会像过去的干部那样不承认它是互助……”沉默了一袋烟的功夫，才接着说：“还是搞我们原来的临时互助组吧，秘密地进行，不让王同志知道，他就没法干涉我们的事情了。”
    单干农民朱光忠本来对互助组的事情是不大过问的。但他对王同志的印象蛮好：因为王同志态度和气，对人没有架子，过去来搞互助组的干部对单干农民都是瞧不起的，现在王同志却时常和他接近、攀谈。同时王同志看见群众的生活忙不过来，还经常给人帮助，如挑水、切草、上地……为了群众的事情，他却不顾自己那脆弱的身体，真是一个好干部。朱光忠想到这里，觉得自己应该把朱光连他们想秘密组织互助组的事情告诉王同志，帮助他了解情况。于是他怀着兴奋的心情找王同志去。四
    王同志听了朱光忠的报告，对这一时期恢复互助组的困难所在完全明白了。他衷心感激朱光忠的帮助。针对这一情况重新部署了一下工作。
    傍晚，王同志走到组员朱光登的家里。他经常到这里来，和他们比较熟悉。只是朱光登和其他的组员一样，不大愿意谈互助的问题，因此他们通常都是攀谈别的事情，可是今天王同志的话儿有点不一样。他说：
    “听说快要割谷了，你忙得过来吗？”
    “忙不过来啊！”朱光登答道。
    “怎么办呢，是不是需要互助？”
    朱光登怔了一下，以为他们秘密商议互助的事情已经被发觉。不等他发话，只听得王同志若无其事地继续说：
      “互助起来就可以解决困难。政府的互助政策是从群众的要求出发的。就是说，群众认识到那种互助好，就搞那种互助。”
    朱光登心里稍微安定了一些，打起精神认真地听下去。这时王同志提高嗓音道：
    “曾经有些干部不从群众的要求出发，硬要搞高级互助组，对于临时互助组瞧不起，不承认它是互助，这是错误的。”
      “这么说，我们过去搞的临时互助组就没有错呀！”朱光登兴奋得抓住王同志的手。
      “当然没有错！”王同志肯定地回答。“所以，现在你们用不着在那里商议秘密互助。”
    朱光登有点不好意思，心中却很高兴。他寻思片刻，说道：“王同志既然知道我们的事情，我就把前前后后的给你讲清楚。”于是他把过去互助组怎样散伙，这次王同志来恢复互助组他们怎样心怀不安，不得不计划秘密互助等说了一遍。他们一直谈到深夜。五
    第二天，朱光登把昨晚事情的经过告诉组员。只听得大家兴奋地说：原来王同志对互助的要求和张同志不一样呀……现在我们可以公开互助了。
    当下他们提议：朱光连、朱光斌仍任正副组长，互助的办法照着过去那样干。王同志把互助的办法考虑好一会，说道：
    “基本上照着过去那样干；不过大家可以考虑，过去的互助是不是还有不合适的地方。”
    王同志的话引起大家的注意。有些组员说：过去的互助虽然有成绩：做活快，人工节省等，但是也有缺点：大家管饭而且要互相比赛吃好的，浪费太大；妇女参加劳动没有计“分”，也是不合理的；有时还不及时结账。这些缺点都要去掉。大家都同意这个意见。
    互助组又搞起来了。他们顺利地度过七八月间农忙的季节。
    一个晚上，王同志帮助互助组总结这一段的工作。大家感到这一时期的工作成绩很大，妇女劳动由不计分改成计分后，她们都积极做活，全组男女三十多个人都下了田，不仅割谷、薅草等抢住火色，还打了湖草（当肥用的），把粪挑到晚谷田里，割谷节省了十二个人工，卖工赚了十五万元；管饭由比赛吃好的改成家常便饭后，每户至少节省五万元，全组七户起码就节省三十五万元；陈修明特别感到这次互助对自己的好处大。他说：“我生病，雇不到人割谷，如果不是恢复互助组，算把我这个病人急死了。”
    组员谈过互助的成绩，王同志说：
   “根据大家说来，我们这次互助所以有成绩，和改进互助的方法分不开，但是大家知道，我们这个互助组是根据过去的旧习惯搞起来的，今天的改进只是一个开始，还要继续改进！”
    大家觉得王同志的话有道理，对今后的互助提出许多建设性的意见：有的人说，评工不要一律计十分，要按劳力强弱和劳动时间长短计算，排工必须发扬民主，做到公平合理；有的人说，在一个农事季节到来以前，要订出生产计划，以便按步就班的劳作；有的人说，一个农事季节过去，不仅要总结全组的工作，还要总结每个人的优缺点，帮助每个人进步；有的人说，为了劳作的方便，要试行长期互助……
    夜深了。大家虽然有点疲倦，心里却是很高兴的；因为大家在谈话中看出一个收获：总结了互助的成绩，提出改进互助的方法，将使互助组提高一步。
