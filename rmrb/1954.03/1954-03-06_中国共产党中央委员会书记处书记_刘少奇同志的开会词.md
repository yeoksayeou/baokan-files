Comrades,

I now announce the opening of the Commemorative Meeting for the First Anniversary of the Death of Stalin, the successor to the great cause of Lenin.

Today, we are here to commemorate the first anniversary of Comrade Stalin's death, and our memory of Comrade Stalin remains very profound. He will always live in our hearts.

Comrade Stalin, together with the great Lenin, was the great leader of the world's working class and the great banner of human liberation. When Comrade Stalin passed away, we Chinese people, like the Soviet people, like the people of all people's democratic countries, and like peace-loving people in all countries around the world, felt infinite grief, and at the same time recognized the need to turn grief into strength, to unite forever, and under the common banner of Lenin and Stalin, to fight to the end for the cause of peace and democracy, for the cause of communism.

As Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "The Greatest Friendship": "For thirty years, Comrade Stalin's doctrines and the example of Soviet socialist construction have propelled the world forward by leaps and bounds. Now the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese people's revolution has won such a great victory, the construction of various people's democratic countries has achieved such great success, the movement of the people of all countries against oppression and aggression has reached such a high tide, and our front of friendship and unity is so consolidated, so it can be asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be crushed by us, and all base provocations are completely useless."

Over the past year, the great victories of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union in the struggle to defend world peace have fully confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's correct thesis.

We Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, after the death of Comrade Stalin, following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, on the one hand, have strived to strengthen our trust and support for the Soviet people and the Soviet Communist Party, and infinitely strengthen the great cause of consolidating the friendly alliance between the Chinese and Soviet people – a common cause that Comrade Stalin constantly cared for and encouraged during his lifetime; on the other hand, we have strived to study Stalin's doctrines, to study the experience of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people in building socialism, and to study Soviet advanced science and technology, in order to promote the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country. Stalin's immortal glory will forever illuminate the road forward for our Chinese people.

I propose that everyone stand up and pay tribute to Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the world communist movement.

### 中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记  刘少奇同志的开会词

    中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记
    刘少奇同志的开会词同志们：
    我现在宣布伟大的列宁事业的继承者斯大林逝世一周年纪念大会开始。
    今天，我们来纪念斯大林逝世的第一周年，我们大家对于斯大林同志的怀念仍然是非常深切的。他永远活在我们的心上。
    斯大林同志和伟大的列宁一起，是世界工人阶级的伟大领袖，人类解放的伟大旗帜。当斯大林同志逝世的时候，我们中国人民，和苏联人民一样，和各人民民主国家的人民一样，和全世界爱好和平的各国人民一样，都感到无限的悲痛，而同时又认识到必须化悲痛为力量，永远地团结在一起，在列宁斯大林这一个共同旗帜下，为和平与民主的事业，为共产主义的事业而奋斗到底。
    正如毛泽东同志在“最伟大的友谊”一文中所说：“三十年来，斯大林同志的学说和苏联社会主义建设的榜样，推动了世界的大踏步前进。现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。”
    一年来，以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营在保卫世界和平事业的斗争中的伟大胜利，完全证实了毛泽东同志这一正确的论断。
    我们中国人民和中国共产党，在斯大林同志逝世以后，遵循着毛泽东同志的教导，一方面，努力加强对苏联人民和苏联共产党的信任和支持，把斯大林同志生前不断关怀和鼓舞的中苏两国人民的共同事业——巩固中苏两国人民的友好同盟的伟大事业无限地加强起来；另一方面，努力学习斯大林的学说，学习苏联共产党和苏联人民建设社会主义的经验，学习苏联先进的科学和技术，以此推进我们国家的伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业。斯大林的不朽的光辉，永远照耀着我们中国人民前进的道路。
    我提议大家起立，向世界共产主义运动的伟大领袖和导师斯大林致敬。
