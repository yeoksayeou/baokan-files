Xinhua News Agency report: Along with the "overall transformation" of China's coal capital, a huge artificial petroleum base will be gradually built in Fushun City.

After rapid recovery and development since liberation, Fushun City's artificial petroleum industry has already established a relatively solid foundation. Currently, the largest artificial petroleum factory in the country, the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 1, will not only continue to unleash its potential this year to increase the production of more liquid fuels and ammonium sulfate, but also plans to add a new batch of dry distillation furnace equipment. The Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2, which began to recover last year, is now also taking effective measures to accelerate the progress of the project. In order to refine gasoline, diesel and other liquid fuels from such a large amount of crude oil, many other arduous and complex projects will be built in the vicinity accordingly. It is estimated that after these projects are completed successively in the next few years, Fushun City's annual crude oil production will increase by two times compared to 1953, and gasoline will increase by ten times.

There are many favorable conditions for building an artificial petroleum base in Fushun. Between the coal seams and the surface of the Fushun coalfield, there are billions of cubic meters of oil shale, which is the raw material for artificial petroleum. These raw materials can supply a huge refinery with an annual output of one million tons of crude oil to produce day and night for more than one hundred years. In addition, the Northeast Petroleum Factories No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 here have not only accumulated experience in capital construction and production of the artificial petroleum industry in recent years, but have also trained a large number of technical personnel and management cadres.

    抚顺将建设成为规模巨大的人造石油基地
    据新华社讯：随着我国煤都的“总体改造”，一个规模巨大的人造石油基地将逐步在抚顺市建设起来。
    抚顺市的人造石油工业经过解放后的迅速恢复和发展，已经创立了比较雄厚的基础。目前全国规模最大的人造石油工厂——东北石油一厂，今年除了继续发挥潜在能力，增产更多的液体燃料和硫铵外，并准备新增一批干馏炉的设备。从去年开始恢复的东北石油二厂，现在也正在采取有效措施，加快工程进度。为了从这样大量的原油中提炼出汽油、柴油等各种液体燃料，附近还要相应地建设其他许多项艰巨复杂的工程。预计这些工程在今后几年内相继完工后，抚顺市的原油年产量将比一九五三年增加两倍，汽油将增加十倍。
    在抚顺建设人造石油基地有很多便利条件。抚顺煤田的煤层和地面之间，埋藏有几十亿立方公尺的油母页岩，这就是人造石油的原料。这些原料可供一座年产原油一百万吨的巨大炼油厂昼夜不停地生产一百多年。此外，这里的东北石油一厂、三厂和四厂，几年来不仅已经积累了人造石油工业基本建设和生产方面的经验，并且已培养出大批技术人材和管理干部。
