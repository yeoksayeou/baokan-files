    Wang Chonglun and His Watch
    Gao Ergong
    Everyone is already very familiar with the major innovation of Wang Chonglun, a young worker at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who completed four years' worth of work in one year. However, this man who conquered time is someone who doesn't have a watch on his wrist.

    Speaking of watches, Wang Chonglun really likes them. A person who loves to tinker with machines has a special affection for a watch, which is like a tiny machine room. With the restoration and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, Wang Chonglun's family has added many new things over the past few years. When Wang Chonglun first pushed the bicycle he bought home, his youngest son said, "My dad rides a bicycle to the factory; when I grow up and go to the factory, I'll ride a motorcycle." The child's naive words are a hope that can be fully realized. But even though life is better, Wang Chonglun, who has been tempered by a hard life, still tries to buy as few things as possible that are not urgently needed. At home, he often says, "Let's overcome it a bit!"

    In order to accurately calculate time, he saved up his wages last year, preparing to buy a sturdy, high-quality watch.

    But one day, Wang Chonglun heard a new message. In order to accelerate our country's economic construction, the state issued the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, hoping that the people would take out a portion of their savings and money they could possibly save to use in the country's construction cause.

    What he heard was an enthusiastic call, and it also seemed like something he wanted to say himself. Because the reality and ideal of the country's socialist industrialization closely attracted his heart. He immediately decided to use the money for buying the watch to purchase bonds. Of course, it would be great to have his own watch, but what could be better than building countless factories and huge machine rooms for the country more quickly!

    Wang Chonglun said, "You can't say that if everyone takes out this little bit of money, it won't do anything. No! The funds for construction precisely need this bit, he contributes a bit, I contribute a bit, you contribute a bit to accumulate." Wang Chonglun subscribed for five million yuan of bonds. Others asked him, "Aren't you buying a watch?" He happily replied, "My heart is a watch!" This is also a sincere statement. In labor, as long as he counts in his heart how many parts he has made, he can tell you what time it is. Simply because he loves labor and for the sake of the motherland's prosperity, he has fought with the time of each part's birth, so he can calculate the time. Last year, he constantly calculated with this precious watch in his heart: I have completed one year's worth of work, I have completed two years' worth of work, I have completed three years' worth of work, I have completed four years' worth of work.

    Now he has started the intense labor of 1954 again. At the same time, he is also happily listening to the sound of our great motherland's clock ticking "Tick! Tock!" as it advances tensely, and his machine room's happy sounds are also integrated into it.

### 王崇伦和他的表

    王崇伦和他的表
    高而公
    鞍山钢铁公司青年工人王崇伦，在一年里面完成了四年工作量的重大创举，大家都已经非常熟悉了。可是，这个征服了时间的人，却是一个手上没有表的人。
    说起表，王崇伦真是喜欢。一个爱摆弄机器的人，对于一个像小小的机器房似的表，是有着一种特殊感情的。随着鞍钢的恢复和建设，几年来，王崇伦家里新添置了许多东西。当王崇伦第一次把买到的自行车推到家里的时候，他的小儿子说：“我爸爸上工厂骑自行车；我长大上工厂要骑摩托车。”孩子天真的话，那也是完全可以实现的希望。但是尽管生活好了，受过艰苦生活锻炼的王崇伦还总是尽量少买不急着要用的东西。在家里，他常好说：“克服点吧！”
    为了能够精确地计算时间，去年他积蓄了工资，准备买一只结实的质量好点的表。
    但是有一天，王崇伦听到一个新的消息。为了加快我们国家的经济建设，国家发行了一九五四年国家经济建设公债，希望人民拿出自己的一部分积蓄和可能节约的钱，用在国家的建设事业上。
    他听到的是热情的号召，同时又好像就是自己要说的话。因为国家的社会主义工业化的现实和理想，紧紧地吸引着他的心。他立刻决定把买表的钱，用来购买公债。当然，自己有一只表是很好的，但是有什么能够比给国家更快地建设起无数的工厂和巨大的机器房更好呢！
    王崇伦说：“不能说每个人拿出这一点点钱，不好干什么。不！建设的资金，正是需要这一点，他一点，我一点，你一点积累起来。”王崇伦认购了五百万元公债，别人问他：“不买表啦？”他快乐地回答说：“我的心，就是一只表！”这也是一句真诚的话。在劳动中，他只要在心里数一下已经做出了多少个零件，他就能告诉你几点钟了。只因为他热爱劳动，为着祖国的富强，他和每一个零件出世的时间斗争过，所以他可以计算出钟点。去年，他就用心里这只宝贵的表，不断的计算过了：我完成一年的工作量了，我完成两年的工作量了，我完成三年的工作量了，我完成四年的工作量了。
    现在他又开始一九五四年紧张的劳动了。同时他也在快乐地倾听着我们伟大祖国的钟摆“滴答！滴答！”紧张前进的声音，那中间也溶合着他的机器房的快乐的响动。
