Qinghai Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region

Arranges Spring Agricultural and Pastoral Production

The Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Region of Qinghai Province recently convened the second joint meeting of the Government Committee and the Consultative Committee to arrange agricultural and pastoral production work.

The Huangnan area had very little snowfall last winter, and the meeting proposed that drought resistance work must be given importance. In terms of agriculture, the meeting decided to use the experience of drought resistance from last year, to repair and build water conservancy projects, consolidate and strengthen existing mutual aid organizations, and prevent natural disasters. More than 600 farmers in the third district of Jianzha County in the Autonomous Region carried out ice accumulation and snow sealing work last winter. The collective ice accumulation in Gajia Village alone was more than five times. The meeting believes that they should be led to organize perennial mutual aid groups according to the needs of the masses. In terms of animal husbandry, the meeting decided to manage the grasslands well, conduct rotational grazing trials, trial planting of pasture, and prevent livestock diseases.

    青海黄南藏族自治区
    布置春季农牧业生产
    青海省黄南藏族自治区在最近召开了政府委员会和协商委员会第二次联席会议，布置农牧业生产工作。
    黄南地区去年冬季降雪很少，会议提出必须重视抗旱工作。在农业方面，会议决定要运用去年抗旱的经验，整修和兴修水利，整顿和加强原有的互助组织，并防止自然灾害。自治区内的尖扎县第三区农民六百余人，在去年冬季已进行积冰封雪工作，仅尕家村集体积冰就在五次以上。会议认为应根据群众要求，领导他们组织常年互助组。在牧业方面，会议决定要管好草原，试办轮牧，试种牧草，并防止牲畜疫病。　（杜华安　秦碧天）
