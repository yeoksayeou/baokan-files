    Henan Actively Promotes New Agricultural Tools
    Henan Province is actively promoting new agricultural tools. The province's supply and marketing cooperatives have already transported over 33,800 new-style walking plows, 1,480 weeding hoes, 1,450 waterwheels, and 20 double-shared plows to the countryside. The Production Materials Department of the Henan Provincial Federation of Cooperatives has also ordered over 1,900 double-shared plows from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory and the Northeast Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory, which are expected to be shipped to various locations in early April. The Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also ordered a batch of horse-drawn agricultural implements and large-scale harvesters, which will be allocated to the prefectural and county farms for demonstration purposes.

    In order to provide technical guidance to farmers, the relevant departments in Henan Province have decided to train over 2,000 cooperative grassroots cadres and agricultural technology extension station cadres in each prefecture before the spring plowing season, teaching them how to use new agricultural tools, pesticides, agricultural machinery, and chemical fertilizers. The Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has printed over 9,000 copies of teaching reference materials, which will be used not only for the training classes but also distributed to cadres at all levels leading agricultural production for reference. At present, various prefectures are successively launching training work. In addition, the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry has also made specific arrangements for the testing, evaluation, and demonstration of complete sets of horse-drawn agricultural implements.

    河南积极推广新农具
    河南省积极推广新式农具。该省供销合作社已运往农村新式步犁三万三千八百多部，耘锄一千四百八十多部，水车一千四百五十多部，双铧犁二十部。河南省合作社联合社生产资料经理部还向华北农业机械总厂、东北农具制造工厂订购了一千九百多部双铧犁，大约可在四月上旬分运各地。河南省人民政府农林厅并订购了一批马拉农具、大型收割机等，拨给专区和县农场示范使用。
    为了能对农民进行技术指导，河南省有关部门决定于春耕前在各专区分别训练两千余名合作社基层干部和农业技术推广站的干部，教会他们使用新式农具、农药、农械、化学肥料等的方法。河南省人民政府农林厅印发教学参考资料九千余份，除供各训练班使用外，并发给各地领导农业生产的干部参考。目前，各专区正先后展开训练工作。另外，河南省人民政府农林厅对成套马拉农具的试验鉴定和示范工作也作了具体布置。（时　瑢）
