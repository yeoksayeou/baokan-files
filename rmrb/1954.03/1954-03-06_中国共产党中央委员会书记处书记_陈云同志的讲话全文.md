Comrades:

    It has been a year since the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause and the dear teacher and friend of the Chinese and Eastern peoples. In this year, the new development of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism has made us more profoundly appreciate the extremely important significance of Stalin's life and career to world humanity.
    Stalin's immortal achievement lies in the fact that in the twenty-nine years after Lenin's death, he led the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people in developing Lenin's cause, building a socialist society on one-sixth of the world's land, and defending it with the most brilliant foresight and the most courageous actions.
    This was a great, serious, and complex struggle. Humanity has never had similar experience in history regarding such a struggle. Until the end of World War II, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country in the world. It was in the encirclement of capitalism. Imperialists not only constantly and painstakingly attempted to carry out interference and sabotage activities from the outside, but also tried their best to find agents from within the Soviet Union. These enemies lurking inside regarded Lenin's death as a good opportunity for them to carry out large-scale activities. At that time, Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and other ambitious people and traitors of all kinds came out one after another to distort Marxism-Leninism, saying either that the Soviet Union could not exist independently without the victory of the world proletarian revolution, or that the Soviet Union could not achieve the victory of building a socialist society due to its technological and economic backwardness. They attempted to use such despicable remarks to confuse people's minds, make the Soviet Communist Party deviate from the path of Leninism, and embark on another path, that is, the path of ruining the achievements of the October Revolution.
    However, Stalin and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party he led demonstrated unparalleled firmness as successors to Lenin's cause.
    In the struggle of the Soviet Communist Party against enemies at home and abroad, Stalin resolutely defended Leninism.
    Based on Lenin's law of uneven development of capitalism under imperialism, Stalin comprehensively analyzed the profound contradictions existing in the imperialist camp, pointed out the direct connection between the development of modern capitalist society and war and the inevitability of proletarian revolution, and provided rich scientific arguments for Lenin's theory that socialism could first triumph in one country.
    Starting from this scientific argument, Stalin led the Soviet Communist Party to formulate a socialist construction plan to realize Lenin's policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization.
    In the powerful progress of socialist construction, Stalin comprehensively expounded and developed the theories of Marxism-Leninism on party building and the party's leading role in the dictatorship of the proletariat, on socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, on the ways to eliminate the exploiting classes, especially the last exploiting class, the rich peasants, on the theory of national and colonial questions, and on the theory of many important issues in the fields of science and philosophy. Stalin's outstanding scientific activities made Marxism-Leninism a torch to guide every step forward in the cause of socialism, and gave the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries that emerged after World War II the most powerful weapon for building socialism.
    According to the Soviet Communist Party and Stalin's pre-war Five-Year Plans, the Soviet people built a powerful socialist country of industrialization and agricultural collectivization, fundamentally transformed the face of old Russia, and transformed the Soviet Union from an old backward country into an advanced country, from an agricultural country into an industrial country. The Soviet Communist Party followed Lenin and Stalin's national policy to liberate all nationalities in the Soviet Union, eliminated the economic and cultural backwardness of oppressed nations in the past, and expanded and strengthened the spiritual and political unity of all nationalities on the basis of socialism. The Soviet state truly became a big family of mutual love and close cooperation among all nationalities in the Soviet Union.
    The great achievements of the pre-war Five-Year Plans greatly strengthened the Soviet Union's national defense, making the Soviet Union invincible in the face of the crisis of World War II.
    World War II was a severe test for the Soviet state. In this war, the great Soviet people and the heroic Soviet army gave the fierce attack of the fascist enemy a doubled rebuff, and finally completely defeated it. The Soviet people endured the greatest sacrifice and achieved a great victory, freeing the people of Europe and Asia from the threat of fascist enslavement. A series of people's democratic countries from China and Korea to Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which emerged in this victory, surrounded the Soviet Union with the most sincere friendship, forming a powerful camp of peace, democracy and socialism. As a result, the international situation reached a leap forward change: the socialist forces expanded throughout the world, the capitalist forces shrank throughout the world, and the isolation of socialist countries before the war completely disappeared.
    This change proved the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and also proved the serious significance of the victory of socialism first in the Soviet Union for the victory of socialism in the world. We will always remember the achievements of the Soviet Communist Party and Stalin in leading the Soviet people to build socialism, because without the Soviet Union as a base, it would not have been possible for socialism to expand its victory so rapidly throughout the world.
    In the years after World War II, the Soviet Union, an advanced socialist country, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party headed by Stalin, restored the economy destroyed by the war, began the construction of transitioning to communism, and actively assisted the people's democratic countries in carrying out socialist construction. Economic cooperation based on mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic upsurge has unfolded between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This cooperation has resulted in the high-speed development of industries and the continuous upsurge of people's material and cultural life in the socialist camp countries.
    As a result of many countries in Europe and Asia successively breaking away from the capitalist system, the scope of major capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France to seize world resources has been reduced. Stalin warned that capitalist countries were already facing a deepening economic and political general crisis, and that they might once again use war to resolve the contradictions between them. It was necessary to awaken the masses to fight for maintaining peace and preventing a new world war through joint efforts.
    The policy of peace is a very important part of Stalin's life and career. We will always remember Stalin's efforts to advocate peace in all times. Stalin believed that peaceful coexistence between socialism and capitalism was possible. Following Lenin's instructions, he insisted on a peaceful diplomatic policy and took all means to avoid war in order to maintain peaceful relations with capitalist countries. It was precisely because of the correct implementation of this policy that the Soviet Union obtained a peaceful period of twenty years from 1921 to 1941, which was an indispensable external condition for ensuring the building of socialism. There is no doubt that continuing to implement Stalin's peace policy today and resolutely opposing the instigators of a new world war is of equally great significance to the cause of socialism. Peace is the bond that connects people of all nationalities, professions, and beliefs. Through this bond, people gathered in hundreds of thousands under the banner of Stalin to launch a powerful movement to support peace and oppose war instigators. There is no doubt that this movement is in the interests of all people in the world. We have a responsibility to inherit Stalin's sacred cause, actively support this movement that is in the interests of the people of the world, to dispel the war haze permeating the world and save millions of people from bloodshed.
    It should be pointed out that the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have made significant efforts in the past year in the struggle for lasting world peace. The first is to force the United States to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement in the East. The Korean War was a large-scale provocative action by American aggressors against world peace. American aggressors thought that the East, that is, here, was an easy place to succeed. But they completely miscalculated and hit a big nail. In this war, the American invading army suffered more than 390,000 casualties, including deaths, injuries, and captives. This was the largest loss of the American army in its history of fighting in the East, exceeding the total number of casualties (360,000) in the First World War, second only to the total number of casualties (1.07 million) in the Second World War. In the end, they still had to sign an armistice agreement in the area where they originally launched the war. The result of this war heavily struck the American plan to launch a new world war, and gave it a beneficial lesson, making it understand to some extent that although war is harmful to people, the losses to itself are even greater.
    The peace policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries has been warmly welcomed by the people of the world. The Soviet Union put forward proposals to ease international tensions, and according to this proposal, took a series of specific measures to improve relations with neighboring countries and many other countries, actively developing international trade, so that the increasingly declining industries of some capitalist countries also received peaceful benefits. At the recent Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, the Soviet Union once again proposed a variety of plans to safeguard world peace, requesting to form an agreement with the other three countries. These proposals reflected the loyalty of the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp to lasting peace, and reflected the reasonable wishes of the people of all countries. Although the Western three foreign ministers headed by the United States rejected the Soviet Union's reasonable proposals on resolving the German issue and other issues, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference finally reached an agreement on holding the Geneva Conference including the People's Republic of China, and an agreement on taking measures to resolve the disarmament issue. These agreements are of great significance for easing international tensions, especially for peacefully resolving the Korean issue and other Asian issues. The agreement of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is a new victory won by the Soviet Union in accordance with Stalin's peace policy.
    The Soviet Union's respectable efforts to ease international tensions in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference have aroused deep sympathy from the people of the world, proving that no reactionary rule has the ability to cut off the spiritual connection between the peace-loving people of the world, and has no ability to eliminate the increasingly surging wave of the peace movement.
    The world people's peace movement is a reliable material force against war and defending peace. We have full reason to believe that the Soviet Union and the entire democratic camp's efforts to ease international tensions following Stalin will be successful.
    Comrades, we also cherish Stalin because he was a dear teacher and friend of the liberation struggles of our country and the Eastern countries.
    As everyone knows, when analyzing the proletarian revolution tactics in the era of imperialism, Lenin pointed out the extremely important role of colonial revolution in the proletarian struggle against imperialism, and pointed out the road to realizing socialism in colonial and economically backward countries. Lenin's creative theory opened up a garden for spreading socialism in the colonial backward countries with very few proletarians, so that socialism, like in the advanced capitalist countries, could be mastered by the masses and form a great revolutionary force. Lenin carried out tremendous work to realize the union of the proletarian revolution and the colonial revolution. But when Lenin was alive, the Eastern colonial revolution was still in its infancy. After Lenin's death, Stalin inherited Lenin's cause and gave extremely valuable instructions and help to the increasingly high tide of the revolutionary movement in the Eastern countries.
    Stalin's writings on the revolutionary movements in China and Eastern colonies and dependent countries have a direct guiding role. In the "Complete Works of Stalin," writings on the Chinese revolution occupy a prominent position.
    Stalin analyzed in detail the nature of the Chinese revolution and the issue of developing towards socialism, the peasant issue, the issue of proletarian leadership and revolutionary tactics, the attitude of the bourgeoisie in the revolution, and the issue of imperialist intervention. In these works, Stalin refuted the Trotsky-Zinoviev viewpoint on the Chinese revolution, defended and developed the Leninist viewpoint on the Chinese revolution, and gave the Chinese Communist Party and the working class a firm direction to lead the revolution.
    Stalin's lofty sympathy and unwavering confidence in the Chinese revolution are the driving force that inspires the Chinese people to move forward forever. As early as 1925, Stalin pointed out that "the power of the Chinese revolutionary movement is endless," believing that "truth and justice are entirely on the side of the Chinese revolution." In 1927, when the Chinese revolution suffered a defeat and many people felt frustrated, Stalin taught that "although the Chinese revolution has not yet reached the point of directly defeating imperialist forces, this fact cannot have any decisive significance for the future of revolutionary development. The great people's revolution will never achieve complete victory in its initial stage of launching. This revolution grows and consolidates through tides and ebbs. This has been the case in all countries, and this has been the case in Russia. The same will be true in China." Stalin pointed out that "Chinese workers and peasants are heading for a new revolutionary upsurge, and only the blind and cowards can doubt this."
    Comrades, the Chinese Communist Party and the working class have not failed Stalin's teachings. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party and the working class bravely accepted the various lessons in the revolution, united the people of the whole country, and finally won victory after a serious struggle with enemies inside and outside the Party.
    The Chinese revolution is the main part of the Eastern revolution. The heroic spirit shown by the Chinese people in the revolution, the strategies adopted, and the experience provided, cannot but inspire and promote the people of the East.
    For a long time, imperialism relied on Eastern colonies as its rear. Now it is facing a serious crisis of losing this rear, and its rear has become the front line.
    The development of the Eastern colonial revolutionary movement on such a large scale is inseparable from the names of Lenin and Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause.
    After the victory of the revolution, China began a new period of transition to socialism. China's socialist construction is carried out under Stalin's direct care, in accordance with the Soviet experience and relying on the close cooperation and generous assistance of the Soviet Union. We feel honored that at the beginning of the construction of our motherland, the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" was signed with the personal participation of Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong. This treaty recorded for the first time the friendship that the people of the two countries have longed for since the great October Revolution. This friendship is based on proletarian internationalism, and no force in the world can damage this friendship.
    Comrades, we must follow the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, gradually carry on the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and build our motherland into a great Socialist state. The friendly alliance between the Soviet Union, which is transitioning to communism, and China, which is transitioning to socialism, is becoming more and more consolidated day by day, and is bound to develop forever. Facts have proved that the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union not only conforms to the interests of the people of the two countries, but also conforms to the interests of the people of all countries in the East and the people of the world. The strength generated from the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, is endless and truly invincible.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people under the name of Stalin!
    Long live the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin!
    Eternal glory to Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause!

### 中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记  陈云同志的讲话全文

    中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记
    陈云同志的讲话全文同志们：
    自从列宁事业的伟大继承者、中国和东方人民的亲爱的导师和朋友约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林逝世到现在，已经一年了。在这一年间，和平、民主和社会主义事业的新的发展使我们更深刻地体会到斯大林的生平事业对于世界人类的极端重大的意义。
    斯大林的不朽的功绩在于，他在列宁逝世以后的二十九年间领导苏联共产党和苏联人民发展了列宁的事业，在占世界六分之一的土地上建成了社会主义社会，并用最英明的远见和最果敢的行动保卫了它。
    这是伟大的、严重的和复杂的斗争。人类在历史上还没有过关于这种斗争的类似的经验。直到第二次世界大战结束时，苏联是世界上唯一无二的社会主义国家。它处在资本主义的包围之中。帝国主义者不但时时刻刻处心积虑地企图从外面来进行干涉、破坏的活动，而且竭力从苏联内部寻找代理人。这种潜伏在内部的敌人曾把列宁的逝世看做是他们大肆活动的好机会。当时，托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子和其他各种各色的野心家和叛徒们纷纷出来曲解马克思列宁主义，不是说没有世界无产阶级革命的胜利苏联就不可能独立存在，便是说苏联因技术上经济上落后不可能达到建成社会主义社会的胜利。他们企图用诸如此类的卑鄙的说法来迷惑人心，使苏联共产党离开列宁主义的道路，而走上另一条道路，即断送十月革命成果的道路。
    但是斯大林和他所领导的苏联共产党中央委员会表现了作为列宁事业继承者的无可比拟的坚定性。
    在苏联共产党反对内外敌人的斗争中，斯大林坚决地捍卫了列宁主义。
  斯大林根据列宁的关于资本主义在帝国主义条件下发展不平衡的规律，全面地分析了存在于帝国主义阵营中的深刻的矛盾，指出了现代资本主义社会发展与战争的直接联系和无产阶级革命的不可避免，对列宁关于社会主义可能在一个国家内首先胜利的理论提供了丰富的科学的论证。
    从这种科学论证出发，斯大林领导苏联共产党制订了实现列宁的国家工业化和农业集体化方针的社会主义建设计划。
    在社会主义建设事业的强大进展中，斯大林全面地论证了和发展了马克思列宁主义关于党的建设和党在无产阶级专政中的领导作用的理论，关于社会主义工业化及农业集体化的理论，关于消灭剥削阶级特别是最后一个剥削阶级即富农的途径问题的理论，关于民族和殖民地问题的理论，以及关于科学和哲学领域中的许多重要问题的理论。斯大林的卓越的科学活动使马克思列宁主义成为引导社会主义事业每一步前进的火炬，并给予在第二次世界大战以后出现的各人民民主国家的共产党和工人党以建设社会主义的最有力的武器。
    按照苏联共产党和斯大林的战前几个五年计划，苏联人民建成了工业化和农业集体化的强大社会主义国家，从根本上改造了旧俄罗斯的面貌，使苏联从旧时的落后的国家变成了先进的国家，从农业国变成了工业国。苏联共产党遵循列宁和斯大林的民族政策解放了苏联境内各族人民，消灭了被压迫民族过去在经济上和文化上的落后性，并在社会主义事业的基础上扩大和加强了各族人民在精神上和政治上的团结。苏维埃国家真正地成了苏联各族人民互相友爱和亲密合作的大家庭。
    战前几个五年计划的伟大成就大大地加强了苏联的国防力量，使得苏联在面临第二次世界大战的危机时已经立于不败之地。
    第二次世界大战是苏维埃国家的一次严重的考验。在这次战争中，伟大的苏联人民和英勇的苏联军队给予法西斯敌人的凶猛的攻击以加倍的回击，而且最后彻底地把它打败了。苏联人民忍受了最大的牺牲，得到了伟大的胜利，使欧洲和亚洲的各国人民解脱了法西斯奴役的威胁。在这个胜利中出现的从中国和朝鲜直到捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利一系列的人民民主国家用最真挚的友谊围绕着苏联，形成了和平、民主和社会主义的强大阵营。国际局势因此达到了一个飞跃的变化：社会主义势力在全世界扩大了，资本主义势力在全世界缩小了，社会主义国家在战前的孤立状态完全消失了。
    这个变化证明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性，也证明了社会主义首先在苏联胜利对于社会主义在全世界胜利的严重意义。我们将永远感念苏联共产党和斯大林领导苏联人民建成社会主义的功绩，因为如果没有苏联做根据地，那么，社会主义如此迅速地在全世界扩展它的胜利，是不可能的。
    在第二次世界大战以后的年代中，社会主义先进国家苏联在以斯大林为首的苏联共产党领导下恢复了被战争破坏的经济，开始了过渡到共产主义的建设，并积极地援助各人民民主国家进行社会主义建设。苏联和人民民主国家间展开了基于互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望的经济合作。这种合作造成了社会主义阵营各国工业的高速度发展和人民物质、文化生活的不断高涨。
    由于欧洲和亚洲许多国家相继脱离资本主义体系的结果，主要资本主义国家美国、英国和法国夺取世界资源的范围缩小了。斯大林曾警告说，资本主义国家业已面临着继续加深的经济和政治的总危机，它们有可能再一次用战争来解决它们之间的矛盾，必须唤起人民群众以共同的努力来为维护和平和防止新的世界大战而斗争。
    和平政策是斯大林生平事业的一个非常重要的部分。我们将永远感念斯大林在一切时期中倡导和平的努力。斯大林认定社会主义和资本主义的和平共处是可能的。他遵循列宁的指示，坚持和平外交政策，采取一切办法来避免战争，以保持与资本主义各国间的和平关系。正是由于正确地执行了这个政策，从一九二一年到一九四一年间，苏联得到了二十年之久的和平时期，这是保证建成社会主义的必不可少的外部条件。毫无疑问，在今天继续执行斯大林的和平政策，坚决反对新的世界大战的挑拨者，对于社会主义事业具有同样重大的意义。和平是联系一切不同国籍、不同职业和不同信仰的人们的纽带。通过这个纽带，人们成千累万地集合在斯大林旗帜下展开了拥护和平和反对战争挑拨者的强大运动。毫无疑问，这个运动是符合全世界一切人民的利益的。我们有责任继承斯大林的神圣事业，积极地支持这个符合全世界人民利益的运动，以驱散弥漫世界的战争阴霾，使千百万人免于流血。
    应当指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国过去一年来在争取世界持久和平的斗争中已经作了重大的努力。首先是迫使美国在东方签订了朝鲜停战协定。朝鲜战争是美国侵略者对于世界和平的一次大规模挑衅行动。美国侵略者以为在东方，也就是说，在我们这里，是一个容易得手的地方。但是他们完全计算错了，结果碰了一个大钉子。美国侵略军在这次战争中死伤及被俘掳达三十九万多人。这是美军在东方作战历史中损失最大的一次，超过它在第一次世界大战中的伤亡总数（三十六万人），仅次于它在第二次世界大战中的伤亡总数（一○七万人）。而他们最后还是不能不在原来发动战争的地带签订停战协定。这个战争的结果沉重地打击了美国发动新的世界战争的计划，并且给了它一点有益的教训，多少使它懂得，战争纵然对人有损，可是对它自己的损失更大。
    苏联和人民民主国家所推行的和平政策在全世界的人民中受到了热烈的欢迎。苏联提出了缓和国际紧张局势的主张，并根据这个主张采取了一系列的具体措施来改进与邻国和其他许多国家间的关系，积极开展国际贸易，使一些资本主义国家的日近衰落的工业也得到了和平的利益。在最近举行的苏、美、英、法四国外长会议上，苏联又提出了保障世界和平的多种方案，要求与其他三国成立协议。这些方案反映了苏联和整个民主阵营对于持久和平的忠诚，反映了各国人民的合理愿望。虽然以美国为首的西方三国外长拒绝了苏联关于解决德国问题和其他问题的合理主张，但是四国外长会议终于达成了关于召开包括中华人民共和国在内的日内瓦会议的协议，和有关采取措施解决裁军问题的协议。这些协议对于缓和国际紧张局势，特别对于和平解决朝鲜问题及其他亚洲问题，是有重大意义的。四国外长会议的协议是苏联秉承斯大林的和平政策取得的一次新的胜利。
    苏联在四国外长会议中为缓和国际紧张局势所作的可敬的努力引起了全世界人民的深刻的同情，证明任何反动统治都没有能力割断世界和平人民之间的精神联系，都没有能力消灭日益高涨的和平运动的浪潮。
    世界人民的和平运动是反对战争和保卫和平的可靠的物质力量。我们有充分理由相信苏联和整个民主阵营继斯大林而作的缓和国际紧张局势的努力是会有成就的。
    同志们，我们感念斯大林，还因为他是我国和东方各国人民解放斗争的亲切的导师和朋友。
    大家知道，列宁在分析帝国主义时代无产阶级革命策略时，指出了殖民地革命在无产阶级反对帝国主义的斗争中的极端重要的作用，指出了殖民地革命和在这些经济上落后的国家中实现社会主义的道路。列宁的创造性的理论在无产阶级还很少的殖民地落后国家中打开了传播社会主义的园地，使社会主义在这些国家中和在资本主义先进国家中一样，能为群众所掌握并形成伟大的革命力量。列宁对于实现无产阶级革命和殖民地革命的联合，进行了巨大的工作。但是列宁在世的时候，东方殖民地革命还在萌芽状态中。在列宁去世以后，斯大林继承列宁的事业，对于东方各国的日益走向高潮的革命运动给了极其可贵的指示和帮助。
    斯大林的著作对于中国和东方殖民地、附属国的革命运动，是具有直接的指导作用的。在“斯大林全集”中，关于中国革命问题的论著占有显著的地位。
    斯大林详尽地分析了中国革命的性质和向社会主义发展的问题、农民问题、无产阶级领导权和革命策略问题、资产阶级在革命中的态度和帝国主义的干涉问题。在这些著作中，斯大林驳斥了关于中国革命的托洛茨基—季诺维也夫观点，保卫了和发展了关于中国革命的列宁主义观点，给予中国共产党和工人阶级以领导革命的坚定的方针。
    斯大林对于中国革命的崇高的同情和不可动摇的信心，是鼓舞中国人民永远前进的力量。早在一九二五年，斯大林就指出“中国革命运动的力量是无穷无尽的”，认为“真理和正义完全是在中国革命方面”。在一九二七年中国革命遭受到失败，有许多人都感觉沮丧的时候，斯大林教导说，“中国革命虽然还没有达到直接战胜帝国主义势力的地步，但这一事实对于革命发展的前途是不能有什么决定意义的。伟大的人民革命总是不会在其开始发动阶段上达到彻底胜利的。这种革命是经过来潮和退潮而增长和巩固起来的。各国情形都曾是如此，俄国情形也曾是如此。中国情形也将是如此。”斯大林指出，“中国工人和农民是在走向新的革命高涨，只有瞎子和懦夫才能够对这一点发生怀疑。”
    同志们，中国共产党和工人阶级没有辜负斯大林的教导。中国共产党和工人阶级在毛泽东同志领导下勇敢地接受了革命中的种种教训，团结了全国的人民，经过和党内外敌人的严重的斗争，最后获得了胜利。
    中国革命是东方革命的主要部分。中国人民在革命中所表现的英勇精神、所采取的策略和所提供的经验，都不能不对东方人民产生鼓舞和推动的作用。
    帝国主义在很长时期内倚靠东方殖民地来做自己的后方。现在它已经面临着丧失这个后方的严重危机了，它的这个后方已经变成前线了。
    东方殖民地革命运动的如此巨大规模的发展，是跟列宁和列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林的名字分不开的。
    中国在革命胜利以后开始了向社会主义过渡的新时期。中国的社会主义建设是在斯大林的直接关怀下按照苏联的经验并依靠苏联的亲密合作和慷慨援助来进行的。使我们感觉光荣的是，在我们祖国建设事业开始的时候，就在斯大林和毛泽东同志亲自参加下订立了“中苏友好同盟互助条约”。这个条约第一次记载了两国人民自从伟大的十月革命以来就存在的渴望互相接近的友谊。这种友谊是以无产阶级国际主义为基础的，世界上没有任何力量能够损坏这种友谊。
    同志们，我们必须遵循马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，逐步地进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。向共产主义过渡的苏联和向社会主义过渡的中国之间的友好同盟关系正在一天比一天更加巩固，并且一定是要永远向前发展的。事实已经证明中苏两国的友好同盟不仅符合于两国人民的利益，而且符合于东方一切国家的人民和全世界的人民的利益的。从中苏两国的友谊中所产生的力量，正如毛泽东同志所说，是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。
    在斯大林名义下的中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说万岁！
    列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林的英名永垂不朽！
