Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Following the conclusion of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States is making every effort to get France to quickly approve the "European Army" treaty. However, the forces in France opposing the rearmament of West Germany have grown even stronger, encouraged by the achievements of the Berlin Conference, making the United States' plan face great difficulties.

United Press correspondent Dave Prie reported from Washington on February 27th that after Secretary of State Dulles returned to Washington from Berlin, he had been discussing with Eisenhower and other senior government officials the release of a statement to "encourage France to ratify the European Defense Community Treaty." According to Reuters, Dulles had reached an understanding with Bidault before leaving Berlin to have the French National Assembly conclude the debate on ratifying the "European Army" treaty by mid-April.

French Foreign Minister Bidault, upon returning to Paris from Berlin, made every effort to advocate that France should quickly ratify the treaty. On February 24th, when Bidault reported on the situation of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, he emphasized that the three Western foreign ministers unanimously believed that Germany should be included in a "united Europe." According to reports, he emphasized at the cabinet meeting that the "European Army" treaty should not be ratified until after the Geneva Conference. At the same time, other spokespersons of the French government have repeatedly stated that the Geneva Conference has nothing to do with the ratification of the "European Army" treaty. They are clearly worried that the prospect of the Geneva Conference will make the parliament even more unwilling to ratify the "European Army" treaty, which would rebuild the revanchist German army and create tension and division. According to a Reuters Paris dispatch, there are currently plans to bring out Weigand, the surrender general of World War II, to lead the suggestion of making some revisions to the "European Army" treaty, temporarily shelving the issue of establishing a so-called supranational organization, to make the treaty easier for the parliament to accept.

However, contrary to Washington's wishful thinking, the forces opposing the "European Army" have become even stronger because the Soviet Union demonstrated the possibility of negotiated solutions at the Berlin Conference and put forward concrete plans for solving the German question and ensuring European security.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly has already expressed on February 25th its welcome to the report submitted by Socialist Jules Moch, which fiercely criticized the "European Army" treaty, and decided to use it as the basis for discussion. Most members of the National Assembly's Defense Committee also agreed with the conclusion of the committee's chairman, General Koenig, against the "European Army" system. Currently, parliament is brewing a postponement of the parliamentary debate on this treaty. Agence France-Presse also said that the Berlin Conference and the decision to hold the Geneva Conference have eased tensions, which "will make those who take a wait-and-see attitude even more eloquent." According to newspaper reports, serious divisions have occurred within the French Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party, and many local organizations and parliamentarians of these two parties have openly expressed their disagreement with the leadership's policy of supporting the "European Army" treaty. According to an Associated Press report, even within the Laniel government, there is "disagreement" on when and what steps should be taken to get parliament to approve the "European Army" treaty. At the same time, the movement of people across France against the "European Defense Community" is developing more vigorously.

### 法国反对重新武装西德的力量更为强大  美国迫使法国批准“欧洲军”条约困难很多

    法国反对重新武装西德的力量更为强大
    美国迫使法国批准“欧洲军”条约困难很多
    【新华社三日讯】柏林四国外长会议结束后，美国竭力想使法国迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。可是法国反对重新武装西德的力量在柏林会议所获成就的鼓舞之下已经更加强大，使得美国的计划遭到很大困难。
    合众社驻华盛顿记者戴普利在二月二十七日报道说：美国国务卿杜勒斯从柏林回到华盛顿后，一直在和艾森豪威尔及政府其他高级官员商讨，要发表一项声明，“鼓励法国批准欧洲防务集团条约”。据路透社消息透露，杜勒斯在离柏林前，已和皮杜尔取得谅解，要使法国国民议会在四月中旬结束关于批准“欧洲军”条约的辩论。
    法国外交部长皮杜尔从柏林一回到巴黎，就竭力鼓吹法国应该赶快批准这个条约。二月二十四日，皮杜尔向国民议会外交委员会报告四国外长会议情况时着重指出：西方三国外长一致认为德国应包括在“统一的欧洲”之内。据消息说，他在内阁会议上曾强调不应等到日内瓦会议后再批准“欧洲军”条约。同时，法国政府的其他发言人也一再声明：日内瓦会议和批准“欧洲军”条约无关。他们显然担心，日内瓦会议的前景会使得议会更加不愿意批准重建德国复仇主义国防军、制造紧张和分裂局面的“欧洲军”条约。据路透社巴黎消息，目前还有人正在打算把第二次世界大战中的投降将军魏刚推出来，由他领衔建议对“欧洲军”条约作一些修改，把成立所谓超国家机构的问题暂时搁置起来，好让这个条约易于被议会接受。
    但是，和华盛顿的如意算盘相反，由于苏联在柏林会议上证明了协商解决问题的可能并且提出了解决德国问题及保障欧洲安全的具体方案，反对“欧洲军”的力量已经更加强大了。
    法国国民议会外交委员会已经在二月二十五日表示欢迎由社会党人儒勒·莫克提出的激烈抨击“欧洲军”条约的报告，并决定以它作为讨论的基础。国民议会国防委员会的大多数委员也同意委员会主席柯尼格将军的反对“欧洲军”制度的结论。目前，议会中正在酝酿要推迟议会关于这个条约的辩论。法新社也说，柏林会议以及关于举行日内瓦会议的决定使得紧张局势缓和，这“会使那些持‘观望’态度的人更加振振有词”。据报纸消息，在法国社会党和激进社会党内部，已发生严重的分歧，许多地方组织和这两党的议员已公开表示他们不同意领导机关的支持“欧洲军”条约的政策。据美联社消息，甚至在拉尼埃政府内部，对于在什么时候、采取什么步骤才能使议会批准“欧洲军”条约也是“意见分歧”的。同时，法国各地人民反对“欧洲防务集团”的运动正更加蓬勃发展。
