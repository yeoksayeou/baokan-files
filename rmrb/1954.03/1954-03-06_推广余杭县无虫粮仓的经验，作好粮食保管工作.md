    Promote the Experience of Pest-Free Granaries in Yu Hang County, and Do a Good Job in Grain Storage
    The autumn grain collection of agricultural tax and the planned grain purchase work nationwide have basically ended, and hundreds of millions of catties of grain are being successively transported into state granaries. How to store these grains well and prevent them from being damaged is an important task on the grain front at present, and also a glorious and arduous task for grain storage personnel in various places.
    If grain storage work is not done well, the country's grain will suffer great losses. According to experiments by Soviet scholars, the offspring of ten pairs of grain weevils, with a large amount of grain and suitable living conditions, can damage more than 406 tons of pure grain in five years; each large rat can steal more than 35 kilograms of grain per year, and a small rat can steal 9 kilograms of grain per year. As for the losses caused by grain heating and spoilage, they are often even greater.
    To do a good job in grain storage, certain equipment is needed, but more important is the responsible spirit of grain storage personnel. At present, our country is concentrating its efforts on industrial construction, and it is impossible to allocate large amounts of funds to build new granaries on a large scale, and the equipment of existing granaries is very simple. Under such circumstances, human efforts are even more important. Of course, it is wrong not to actively improve the equipment of granaries under possible conditions. However, it is even more wrong to overemphasize objective difficulties, believing that our current granary equipment conditions are too poor to do a good job in storage. The result will inevitably relax human efforts. The fact that the grain departments in Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province, have created a large number of pest-free granaries under the conditions of poor granary equipment strongly criticizes this idea and sets a good example for grain departments across the country.
    The experience of Yu Hang County in creating pest-free granaries should be actively promoted by grain departments in various places. In promoting this experience, attention should be paid to grasping the following links.
    First, seize the ideological education work. All localities should combine the education of the general line to make grain storage workers realize that grain is an important material to ensure people's lives and the country's socialist construction, and that storing grain well is a major responsibility that granary personnel should bear to the country and the broad masses of the people. Muddled ideas such as "there is no future in doing grain storage work" and "managing granaries is not glorious" should be criticized. On the basis of carrying out this education, methods such as organizing labor competitions can be used to consolidate and continuously improve the work enthusiasm of grain work cadres.
    Second, educate all grain storage cadres to conscientiously implement the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than treatment" in order to minimize the chance of accidents. This is an important experience in Soviet grain storage work, and also an important experience for Yu Hang County in creating a large number of pest-free granaries. Especially at present, the amount of grain stored in granaries in various places is very large, the various equipments are poor, and there are many factors that damage the grain. If preventive work is not done in advance, once an accident occurs, it is difficult to clean up. Therefore, all localities must criticize all ideas that neglect prevention and take specific measures to prevent problems before they occur as much as possible.
    Third, pay attention to educating and mobilizing the masses to assist in grain storage work. The practice of Yu Hang County in organizing neighborhood grain protection groups and educating the masses near the granary to assist storage cadres in protecting national grain can be promoted in various places according to specific circumstances. Only by mobilizing the masses near the granaries can environmental sanitation be truly maintained and the root causes of pests be completely eliminated.
    Grain storage work is a major task, and all localities should learn from the experience of Yu Hang County and strive to complete this glorious and arduous task.

### 推广余杭县无虫粮仓的经验，作好粮食保管工作

    推广余杭县无虫粮仓的经验，作好粮食保管工作
    全国农业税秋征工作和粮食计划收购工作已经基本结束，成万成亿斤的粮食正在陆续运入国家粮库。如何把这些粮食保管好，不使遭受损失，是当前粮食战线上的一项重要的工作，也是各地粮食保管人员的一项光荣、艰巨的任务。
    粮食保管工作作不好，会使国家的粮食遭受很大的损失。据苏联学者们的实验证明：十对谷象虫的后代，在有大批粮食和生存条件适宜的情况下，经过五年的时间，就能损害四百零六吨以上的纯净粮食；每只大老鼠每年能偷食三十五公斤以上的粮食，一只小老鼠每年能偷食九公斤的粮食。至于粮食发热、霉坏造成的损失，往往更为巨大。
    要作好粮食保管工作，需要有一定的设备，但是更重要的还是粮食保管人员的负责精神。目前我国正在集中力量进行工业建设，不可能抽出大批资金，大规模地建设新的粮库，而现有粮仓的设备又很简陋，在这样的情况下，人为的努力就更加重要了。当然，在可能的条件下，不积极改善粮库的设备是不对的。但过分地强调客观困难，认为现在我们粮库设备条件太差，很难作好保管工作，却是更加错误的，其结果必然放松了人为的努力。浙江省余杭县粮食部门在粮库设备条件不好的情况下，创造大批无虫粮仓的事实，有力地批判了这种思想，为全国粮食部门树立了
  一个良好的榜样。
    余杭县创造无虫粮仓的经验，各地粮食部门应该积极加以推广。在推广这一经验时，应注意掌握以下几个环节。
    第一、抓紧思想教育工作。各地应结合总路线的教育，使粮食保管工作人员认识到粮食是保证人民生活和国家社会主义建设的重要物资，把粮食保管好，乃是粮库人员对国家和广大人民应负的重大责任。应该批评那些认为“作粮食保管工作没有出息”、“管粮库，不光彩”等糊涂思想。在进行这项教育的基础上，可以采用组织劳动竞赛等方式，来巩固和不断地提高粮食工作干部的工作热情。
    第二、教育全体粮食保管干部认真贯彻“防重于治”的粮食保管方针，以尽量减少事故发生的机会。这是苏联粮食保管工作中的一项重要经验，也是余杭县创造大批无虫粮仓的重要经验。特别是目前各地粮仓保管的粮食数量很大，各种设备又差，而使粮食遭受损害的因素很多，如果事先不做好预防工作，一旦事故发生，就很难收拾。因此，各地必须批判各种忽视预防的思想，并采取具体办法，尽量防患于未然。
    第三、注意教育和动员群众协助进行粮食保管工作。余杭县组织四邻护粮小组，教育粮库附近群众协助保管干部保护国家粮食的作法，各地可根据具体情况加以推广。只有把粮仓附近的群众动员起来，才能真正保持环境卫生，彻底消除发生虫害的根源。
    粮食保管工作是一项重大的工作，各地应当学习余杭县的经验，努力完成这一光荣而艰巨的任务。
