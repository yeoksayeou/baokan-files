Arrived in the Motherland of Brother Luo Shengjiao
Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China Cui ?

When the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea visited last year, I saw my Chinese father, and I shed tears. At that time, I thought, when will I be able to see my Chinese mother, younger brother, and younger sister, see the motherland of my nurturing brother Luo Shengjiao, and see Chairman Mao, the great friend of the Korean people?

On March 1st this year, I was in class when the teacher suddenly called me out and told me: the county called, asking me to participate in the Korean People's Delegation to China. I jumped up with joy when I heard it, and quickly ran home, ready to tell my parents the good news. Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered the house, my parents greeted me with smiles. It turned out that the county had already notified my parents. They took my hand and instructed: "Although your parents gave birth to you, it was your brother Luo Shengjiao who saved your life. Therefore, the parents of your brother Luo Shengjiao are just like your own biological parents. This time you go to Hunan, China, you must greet them well and thank them on our behalf. You will definitely feel like you are at home there."

Everyone in our Luo Shengjiao Village knew that I was going to China, and all the men, women, old and young gathered to see me off. The young people said, "China is carrying out large-scale construction, you must take a good look and come back and tell us, we must follow the example of Luo Shengjiao's motherland to build our country." The old mothers said, "We cannot personally go to Hunan to see Luo Shengjiao's mother, please take a good look at her for us, comfort her, and thank her on behalf of the Korean mothers." The old people said, "If you see Chairman Mao, say, most respected Chairman Mao, the residents of our Luo Shengjiao Village cannot come to China one by one to see you and thank you. Now, our child Cui ?, who was the Korean child rescued by the martyr Luo Shengjiao under your education, has come to China to see you and thank you on our behalf. We are living very well now, with food, clothing, and houses that have been repaired with the help of the Volunteer Army comrades. Please rest assured! We have also received the help of 80 billion yuan from China, and we must rebuild our homes and build them even better than before. At that time, we really hope that you can come and see Korea."

On March 2nd, I left home and arrived in Pyongyang. On March 13th, our delegation crossed the Yalu River and arrived in Andong. As soon as we stepped onto this land, we were surrounded by enthusiastic friendship. From Andong to Shenyang to Tianjin to Beijing, there were so many people welcoming us everywhere. They shook hands and hugged us, held flowers, and sang "The Song of General Kim Il-sung" in unison. I felt like I hadn't arrived in another country, I had come to the motherland of my brother!

What I will never forget are these two occasions. One was on March 18th at the meeting where the delegation visited the families of Volunteer Army martyrs and soldiers. I met Hou Yanping, the mother of a Volunteer Army soldier. Her son also gloriously sacrificed himself for the sake of the Korean people. She hugged me tightly, carefully looked at my face, and said with tears in her eyes after a long while: "You have finally seen a Chinese mother, and I have finally seen a Korean child." The other was on March 20th when I met with children and young people in Beijing, including a thirteen-year-old little sister named Zhang Junying, who was the child who presented flowers to Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Square on October 1st last year. What a lovely and happy little sister! That day, she ran and jumped over and affectionately called me brother, handing me a large bouquet of flowers. At this meeting, I also met Wang Defu, a second-class combat hero of the Volunteer Army who returned to his motherland. He led a class to eliminate more than 400 enemies in the Wonsan battle. He wore a soldier's Medal of Honor and two Military Service Medals on his chest. How spirited and majestic. Looking at him, I really felt like I was seeing my brother Luo Shengjiao again. I was filled with gratitude and couldn't speak. I pinned a Kim Il-sung commemorative badge on him, and he hugged me tightly, calling me good brother. And listen to how he reported to the young people and children present about the situation of the Volunteer Army brothers in Korea now. He said: "We, together with the People's Army, hold our positions firmly and are always vigilant. If the enemy dares to come, we will beat them hard. If they don't come, we will hold a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, practicing military skills and learning culture at the same time. We improve our skills and master modern weapons. When we have free time, we also pick up hoes and hammers to help the Korean people build."

Also at this meeting, I saw worker brothers and farmer brothers, and the deeds they talked about really moved me, making me feel that the motherland of my brother Luo Shengjiao is truly a great heroic country. It is my greatest luck to be able to visit it!

　　来到了罗盛教哥哥的祖国
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员  崔?
    去年中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团来朝鲜的时候，我看到了我的中国爸爸，我掉泪了。当时我就想，多咱能看到我那中国母亲、弟弟和妹妹，看看抚养了我的罗盛教哥哥的祖国，看看朝鲜人民伟大的朋友毛主席呢？
    今年三月一日，我正在学校上课，忽地老师叫了我去，告诉我说：郡里来了电话，要我参加朝鲜人民访华代表团访问中国去。我听了高兴得跳了起来，连忙跑到家里，准备把这个喜讯赶快告诉爸爸妈妈。想不到我一进家门，爸爸妈妈就笑着迎出来了，原来郡里已通知我的爸爸妈妈了。他们拉着我的手嘱咐说：“你爸爸妈妈虽说生了你，但是救出你生命的是你罗盛教哥哥，所以你罗盛教哥哥的爸爸妈妈，也就和你亲生的父母一样。这次你到中国湖南，一定要好好问候他们，代我们感谢他们。在那里你一定也会觉得象在家里一样。”
    我们罗盛教村的人全知道我要上中国来了，一村的男女老少集合起来欢送我。青年们说：“中国正在进行大规模建设，你要好好看看，回来告诉我们，我们一定要按照罗盛教祖国的榜样来建设我们的国家。”老妈妈们说：“我们不能亲自去湖南看看罗盛教的妈妈，请你代我们好好看看她，安慰她，代表我们朝鲜的母亲感谢她。”老人们说：“你要是看到毛主席，就说，最敬爱的毛主席，我们罗盛教村的居民不能一个个到中国来看您，感谢您，现在，我们的孩子崔?，就是您教养下的罗盛教烈士救起的那个朝鲜孩子，他现在来到中国，代表我们来看您，感谢您。我们现在生活得很好，有吃的，有穿的，住的房子也在志愿军同志的帮助下修盖起来了，请老人家放心吧！我们又得到中国八万亿元巨款的帮助，我们一定要重建自己的家园，建设得比以前还要好。那时候，真希望您能来看看朝鲜。”
    三月二日，我离开了家，到了平壤，三月十三日，我们代表团过了鸭绿江，到安东了。一踏到这块土地上，我们就被热情的友谊包围了，从安东到沈阳到天津直到北京，到处都是这样多的欢迎的人，他们和我们握手拥抱，他们捧着鲜花，齐声唱着“金日成将军之歌”，我觉得我真不是到了另一个国家，我是来到了我哥哥的祖国！
    最使我难忘的是这两次。一次是三月十八日代表团访问志愿军烈属、军属的大会上，我会见了一位志愿军的妈妈侯彦平。她的儿子也为了我们朝鲜人民光荣牺牲了。她把我紧紧地抱住，仔细地端详着我的脸，眼里泛着泪花，好半天才说：“你总算看到了中国的妈妈，我也总算看到了朝鲜的孩子。”另一次是三月二十日我和北京市的少年儿童和青年们会面了，其中有一位十三岁的小妹妹张筠英，她是在去年十月一日在天安门上给毛主席献花的儿童，多么可爱、幸福的小妹妹啊！那天她跑着、跳着过来亲热地叫我哥哥，把一大捧鲜花递到我手里。就在这个会上，我也见到了回到祖国的志愿军二级战斗英雄王德福，他在元山战役中带领一个班消灭了四百多敌人，他胸前挂着一枚战士荣誉勋章，两枚军功章，多么精神，多么威武。看着他，我真仿佛又看到我的罗盛教哥哥一样，我满心的感激，说不出话来。我给他佩带了金日成纪念章，他紧紧抱住我，叫我好兄弟。再听听他是怎样向到会的青年和少年儿童报告着志愿军哥哥现在在朝鲜的情况吧。他说：“我们和人民军一起，紧守住自己的阵地，随时警惕着。敌人敢来，就狠狠的揍它们。不来，我们就一手拿枪，一手拿笔，一面练兵，一面学文化。提高本领，掌握现代化武器。空出手来，还要拿起锄头铁锤，帮助朝鲜人民建设。”
    也就在这个会上，我还看到了工人哥哥和农民哥哥们，他们谈的事迹真使我感动，使我感到罗盛教哥哥的祖国真是一个伟大的英雄的国家，我能来访问它，真是我最大的幸运啊！（附图片）
