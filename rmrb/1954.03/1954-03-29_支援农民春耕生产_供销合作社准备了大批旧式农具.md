Xinhua News Agency, 28th: To support farmers' spring ploughing production, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have prepared a large number of commonly used old-style farm tools. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of February, cooperative systems nationwide had purchased and ordered over 33 million various old-style farm tools. As spring ploughing begins in various regions, local cooperatives are successively supplying the tools to farmers.

This year, the amount of farmers' production investment in spring ploughing exceeds that of any previous year. The quantity of farm tools managed by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions, based on farmers' needs, has broken last year's record. The Shandong Province Cooperative has prepared over 4.6 million old-style farm tools, which is 80 percent more than the actual supply volume for the entire last year. Anhui Province is preparing to supply farm tools equivalent to four times the supply volume of the first half of last year. The Xinjiang Province Cooperative completed its processing plan for one million farm tools ahead of schedule in January. The Fifth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Qianwei County, Sichuan Province, prepared farm tools that would allow each farmer household to buy an average of four pieces before spring ploughing.

The large number of old-style farm tools purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions were mostly processed and ordered from local handicraft production cooperatives and craftsmen after surveying farmers' needs. The Hubei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed processing contracts worth over 1.9 billion yuan with local craftsmen for iron and wooden farm tools. When signing the contracts, the supply and marketing cooperative convened a forum of farmers and craftsmen to discuss the specifications and quality of the farm tools. The Supply and Marketing Cooperatives of Gaotang, Yanggu, Guanxian, and Guanchao counties in Shandong Province held production and sales forums with six local handicraft industries, including ironware, woodwork, and bamboo ware, and signed 141 production and sales contracts. This spring, the Anhui Province Cooperative ordered over 11 million farm tools for processing from local handicraft production cooperatives and production teams. Cooperatives in more than 30 counties in Heilongjiang Province conducted surveys on farmers' needs for farm tools, gaining a preliminary understanding of the patterns of farmers' equipment additions and the needs of different production seasons, thereby revising supply plans and placing processing orders with 90 percent of the province's handicraft households accordingly. The large-scale processing orders placed by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have made the business of handicraftsmen particularly prosperous, especially providing a broad sales market for the products of handicraft production cooperatives. In January, 85 iron and wood farm tool production cooperatives in Wenjiang, Fushun, Luxian, and other counties in Sichuan Province manufactured a total of over 124,000 farm tools and sold over 116,000 pieces. The farm tools supplied by farm tool production cooperatives in various regions of Sichuan Province this year will increase by 182 percent compared to last year.

    支援农民春耕生产
    供销合作社准备了大批旧式农具
   【新华社二十八日讯】各地供销合作社大批地供应农民目前惯用的旧式农具。据不完全统计，到二月底止，全国合作社系统已采购和订购的各种旧式农具达三千三百多万件。在各地春耕开始前后，各地合作社陆续把农具供给农民。
    今年春耕中农民生产投资的数量超过了以往任何一年，各地供销社根据农民需要所经营的农具的数量，打破了去年的纪录。山东省合作社已准备好的旧式农具达四百六十多万件，比去年一年的实际供应量多百分之八十。安徽省准备供应的农具相当于去年上半年供应量的四倍。新疆省合作社在一月份已提前完成了一百万件农具的加工计划。四川省犍为县五区供销社在春耕前已准备的农具平均可供每户农民买四件。
    各地供销社采购的大批旧式农具，多数是经过向农民调查后，向当地手工业生产合作组织和手工业者加工订货的。湖北省供销合作社向当地手工业者签订了价值十九亿多元的铁、木农具加工合同，订合同时，供销社召集农民和手工业者开了座谈会，讨论了农具的规格、质量。山东省高唐、阳谷、冠县、观朝四县供销合作社分别和当地铁器、木器、竹器等六个手工业行业举行了产销座谈会，签订了一百四十一件产销合同。安徽省合作社今年春季向当地手工业生产合作社和生产小组加工订货的农具达一千一百多万件。黑龙江有三十多个县的合作社对农民需要农具的情况作了调查，初步了解到农民增添农具的规律和不同生产季节的需要情况，从而修订了供应计划，并据此向全省百分之九十的手工业户进行了加工订货。各地供销合作社大批地加工订货，使手工业者的生意格外兴隆，特别是使手工业生产合作组织的产品有了广阔的销售市场。四川省温江、富顺、泸县等八十五个铁木农具生产合作社一月份共制造了十二万四千多件农具，销售了十一万六千多件。四川省各地农具生产合作社今年供给农民的农具将比去年增加百分之一百八十二。
