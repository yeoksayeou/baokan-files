Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 20th: This correspondent reports: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 18th, the Korean-Chinese side sternly condemned the U.S. side for violating the armistice agreement by illegally shipping parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel from outside Korea without reporting to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and refusing supervision by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. According to extremely incomplete materials seized by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, the parts and disassembled pieces illegally shipped into Korea by the U.S. side from August to the end of November last year could be assembled into large quantities of weapons and combat aircraft. The U.S. side could not deny these facts at all, and these facts irrefutably prove that the U.S. side's shipment of parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel has increased the U.S. military strength in Korea.

Article 13, Paragraph D of the Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that neither side shall introduce reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, or ammunition into Korea after the armistice. This provision is clear, unambiguous, and not subject to misinterpretation. The parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel have not lost their nature as war materiel. The U.S. side attempts to evade its obligations under the armistice agreement by sophistry, claiming that the shipment of parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel is not related to the above-mentioned clause of the armistice agreement, but the U.S. side's sophistry can only place it in an absurd position. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on October 3 last year, General Li Sang-cho questioned the U.S. Senior Member, Mr. Byrean, saying: "If the lenses of the glasses you are wearing are packed in one box, and the frames are packed in another box, and then brought in and assembled, would that not be a pair of glasses? Similarly, if one ship transports gun barrels and gun carriages, and another ship transports gun carriages or other parts, and then they are assembled, wouldn't that be a cannon?" This was originally an extremely simple question of common sense, but the insincere Byrean could not answer. On another occasion, at the port of Pusan in South Korea, the U.S. side refused the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to inspect the shipment of parts and disassembled pieces. At that time, a Neutral Nations personnel took off the cap of his fountain pen and put the barrel and the cap in two different pockets, and said to the U.S. liaison officer: "According to your meaning, I only have the parts of a fountain pen now, and not a fountain pen?" At that time, the U.S. liaison officer was speechless.

Recalling the U.S. side's slander against the Korean-Chinese side on October 12 last year, one can see the U.S. side's rogue face even more clearly. At that time, the U.S. side falsely accused the Korean-Chinese side of disassembling combat aircraft, packing them in boxes, and transporting them to Yiju Airport, and requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send mobile teams to investigate. The result of the investigation proved that the U.S. side's accusation was completely fabricated. However, it is worth noting that in that slander incident, the U.S. side had clearly stated that shipping war materiel into Korea in the form of parts and disassembled pieces violated the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph D of the Armistice Agreement; but now the U.S. side openly claims that the shipment of parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel is not related to the above-mentioned clause of the Armistice Agreement, and therefore does not need to be reported or supervised. This self-contradictory situation illustrates the U.S. side's conspiracy to deliberately violate the Armistice Agreement and ship in reinforcing war materiel.

The U.S. side has stated that the Li Seung-man puppet army has expanded by four divisions after the armistice, and the American advisors in the Li puppet army even announced that the firepower of one of the divisions is one-third stronger than the original organization. People cannot help but ask: Where did the equipment for these newly expanded divisions and enhanced firepower come from? The fact that the U.S. side expanded the Li Seung-man puppet army not only generally illustrates the U.S. side's attempt to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, but also specifically illustrates the conspiratorial nature of the U.S. side's illegal shipment of parts and disassembled pieces of war materiel.

### 美方非法运入增援性作战物资装备李伪军

    美方非法运入增援性作战物资装备李伪军
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者报道：在十八日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面严厉指责美方违反停战协定非法从朝鲜境外运入作战物资的零件与拆散件而不向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告，并拒绝中立国视察小组的监督。据中立国视察小组查获的极不完全的材料，美方在去年八月到十一月底期间非法运入朝鲜的零件和拆散件，可以装配成大批武器和作战飞机。美方对这些事实不能抵赖一句，而这些事实无可置辩地证明了美方运入作战物资的零件与拆散件已增加了美方在朝鲜的军事力量。
    停战协定第十三款卯项明确规定任何一方在停战后不得运入增援性的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药。这个规定是明确无误、不容曲解的。作战物资的零件与拆散件并未失去其作为作战物资的性质。美方企图用诡辩的手法逃避停战协定所加给它的义务，说什么作战物资的零件、拆散件的运入与停战协定上述款项无关，但是美方的这种诡辩，其结果只能使它自己陷于荒唐无稽的地位。去年十月三日的军事停战委员会会议上，李相朝将军曾质问美方首席委员勃里安说：“如果把你所戴的那付眼镜的镜片装在一个箱子里，把眼镜架子装在另一个箱子里拿进来，然后把它们装配起来算不算一付眼镜？同样地，一只船运进炮筒和炮架，另一只船运进炮车或其他部分，然后把它装配起来，那难道不是一门炮吗？”这本来是一个极其浅易的属于常识性的问题，但别有居心的勃里安竟不能回答。还有一次，在南朝鲜釜山口岸，美方曾拒绝中立国视察小组视察零件与拆散件的运入，当时一个中立国人员就把他的自来水笔笔帽拿下来和笔杆分装在两个衣袋里，对美方联络官说：“照你的意思，我现在只有自来水笔的零件，而没有自来水笔了？”当时美方联络官瞠目结舌，说不出话来。
    回忆一下去年十月十二日美方对朝中方面的诬控，更可以看出美方的无赖嘴脸。当时美方诬控朝中方面将作战飞机拆散后装箱运入义州机场，并要求中立国监察委员会派机动小组前往调查，调查的结果证明美方的指控完全是捏造。但是值得注意的是，在那一次诬告事件中，美方已明白地表示，将作战物资以零件和拆散件的方式运入朝鲜是违反停战协定第十三款卯项的规定的；可是现在美方竟又公然宣称作战物资的零件、拆散件的运入与停战协定的上述款项无关，因此不须报告，不受监督。这种自相矛盾的情况说明了美方故意违反停战协定、运入增援性作战物资的阴谋。
    美方曾表明停战后李承晚伪军又扩编了四个师，在李伪军中的美国顾问并且宣布其中一个师的火力较原编制强三分之一。人们不禁要问：这些新扩编的师和增强了的火力，其装备是从哪里来的？美方扩编李承晚伪军的事实，不仅是一般地说明美方企图保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，而且具体地说明了美方非法运入作战物资的零件和拆散件的阴谋性质。
