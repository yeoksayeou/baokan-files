Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 11th (TASS dispatch): The Australian "Tribune" commented on the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" saying that this agreement "is a threat to Australia."

The "Tribune" said: During the Second World War, Japan was armed on the basis of an "understanding" that it would attack north. But the Japanese militarists attacked the south. Now, with the help of Wall Street, the Japanese militarists and monopolists have regained their power. They will probably attack south again.

Speaking of the essence of this agreement, the "Tribune" pointed out: The agreement does not even make a verbal promise to ensure that Japan's armed forces will not be used for aggression that may be directed against Australia.

The "Tribune" continued: "This new treaty will also exacerbate international tensions, and it will inevitably increase the arms burden of all countries, including Australia, although, due to the US-Menzies arms race, we still lack many necessities of life.

"Australians are increasingly uneasy about the revival of Japanese militarism. In Australia, the Communist Party's policy of opposing Japanese rearmament is gaining increasingly broad support."

    澳大利亚“论坛报”评美日“共同防御援助协定”
    指出美国加速武装日本威胁澳大利亚安全
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社悉尼十一日讯：澳大利亚“论坛报”评论美日“共同防御援助协定”说：这个协定“对于澳大利亚是一个威胁”。
    “论坛报”说：在第二次世界大战中，日本是在它将向北进攻这个“谅解”的基础上得到援助而武装起来的。但是日本军阀进攻的却是南面。现在，日本军阀和垄断资本家们又在华尔街的援助下恢复势力。他们大概又会向南进攻。
    在谈到这个协定的实质时，“论坛报”指出：协定甚至没有提出一个口头的诺言来保证日本的武装部队不会被利用于可能是针对澳大利亚的侵略目的。
   “论坛报”接着说：“这个新条约也将加剧国际紧张局势，它势必会加重各国的军备负担，澳大利亚也包括在内，虽然，由于美国—孟席斯的扩军运动，我们还缺乏许多生活必需品。
    “澳大利亚人对日本军国主义的复活愈来愈感到不安。在澳大利亚，共产党反对日本重新武装的政策得到了日益广泛的支持。”
