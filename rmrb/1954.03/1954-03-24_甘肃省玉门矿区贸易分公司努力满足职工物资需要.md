The Yumen Mining Area Trade Branch of Gansu Province Strives to Meet the Material Needs of Employees

The Yumen Mining Area Branch of Gansu Provincial Trade Company has strengthened its mobile sales operations, closely contacted the departments using goods, and achieved timely supply.

Transportation in the Yumen area is inconvenient, and goods cannot be transferred in a timely manner, resulting in frequent difficulties in supply, which affects the provision of goods. In order to ensure a sufficient supply, the Yumen Mining Area Branch of Gansu Provincial Trade Company established a long-term procurement network last year. It dispatched dedicated personnel to reside in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Wuwei, and other places for procurement, and promptly contacted transportation departments to strengthen the transportation and allocation of goods. This ensures timely supply to meet the needs of employees. Last year, the company managed 3,063 types of commodities and supplied local industrial and mining employees and the masses with a large quantity of various cotton fabrics, meat products, vegetables, cigarettes, soap, fruits, and other goods.

The company's cadres, after clearly understanding that serving production enterprises is a glorious task to ensure the smooth completion of production, actively improved their management methods. They strengthened mobile organization, went deep into factories, mining areas, and transportation teams to supply goods, and were welcomed by employees. The company's sales units and warehousing and business departments also used telephone communication to understand sales conditions, achieve mutual exchange of information, and changed the past phenomenon of stockpiling on one hand and out-of-stock situations on the other.

After taking these measures, the company's capital turnover rate last year accelerated by 2.6 times compared to 1952, and it overfulfilled the annual sales plan by 76 percent.

Currently, the company is vigorously purchasing goods according to needs and appropriately expanding its organization. At the same time, it also plans to add livestock farms and three farms, expand the vegetable planting area of the original farm, and make full use of the equipment of the original livestock farm to ensure the supply of employees' increasing needs for meat products and vegetables.

    甘肃省玉门矿区贸易分公司努力满足职工物资需要
    甘肃省贸易公司玉门矿区分公司加强流动卖货业务，密切联系用货部门，作到了及时供应。
    玉门地区交通运输不便，不能及时调拨商品，货源经常发生困难，影响供应。甘肃省贸易公司玉门矿区分公司，为了保证充分供应，在去年建立了长期采购网，分别派专人经常住在西安、兰州、张掖、武威等地采购，并及时联系运输部门，加强货物的运输、调拨。这样就能及时供应职工的需要。去年该公司经营商品的品种有三千零六十三种。供应了当地工矿职工、群众各种棉布、肉食品、菜蔬类和香烟、肥皂、瓜果等很多货物。
    该公司的干部，在明确认识了为生产企业部门服务就是保证生产顺利完成的光荣任务后，积极改善了经营方法。他们加强了流动组织，深入到工厂、矿区、运输队进行供应，受到了职工的欢迎。该公司各推销单位和仓储、业务部门还用电话联系，了解销售情况做到互通有无，转变了过去一面积压一面脱销的现象。
    在采取了这些措施后，该公司去年的资金周转率较一九五二年加速了二点六次，并超额完成了年度销售计划的百分之七十六。
    目前，该公司正根据需要，大力进货，适当的扩大机构。同时，还计划增设畜牧场和三个农场，扩大原有农场的种菜面积，充分利用原有畜牧场的设备，以保证供应职工日益增长的肉食品、菜蔬类的需要。　（张汝云）
