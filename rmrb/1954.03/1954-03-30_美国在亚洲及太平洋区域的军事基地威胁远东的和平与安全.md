    U.S. Military Bases in Asia and the Pacific Threaten Peace and Security in the Far East
    Tan Wenrui
    On the eve of the Geneva Conference, all who care about peace in Asia and the world deeply hope that the tense situation in the Far East and the world can be further eased. However, the U.S. ruling clique is not only trying to obstruct the final settlement of the Korean issue, intensifying direct intervention and expansion of the Indochina War, but also escalating its efforts to actively expand and strengthen its network of military bases in Asia and the Pacific region.

    Since the beginning of this year, in order to promote its so-called "New Look" military policy of strengthening "strategic mobile attack forces," the U.S. ruling clique has intensified military construction projects in the central Pacific, including Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, and Guam; in the western Pacific, it has announced the indefinite occupation of Okinawa as a military stronghold, accelerated the expansion of Clark Air Base and the Cubi Point naval and air base in the Philippines, and is pressuring the Magsaysay government to demand more new military bases. At the same time, in Southeast Asia, the United States is holding negotiations with Pakistan regarding military bases and urging the Pibul government to rebuild thirteen airfields and construct a new naval base on the strategic coastline.

    This activity of the United States, intensifying the expansion of military bases in Asia and the Pacific, is linked to the U.S.'s aggressive plans to actively piece together the Pacific aggressive bloc and the Middle East aggressive bloc.

    At the end of 1953, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Anderson openly stated that before World War II, the "foremost outpost" of the United States in the Pacific was Pearl Harbor, but now the U.S. border has extended to the Asian continent, from Korea to Taiwan, Indochina, Thailand, and Burma. This arrogant statement fully exposes the U.S. attempt to dominate Asia and the Pacific.

    During World War II, the United States had already established more than two hundred military bases of varying sizes and types in the Pacific region. In recent years, the United States has continued to establish a network of military bases scattered throughout Asia and the Pacific.

    After occupying Japan, the United States took over all of Japan's original naval, land, and air force bases and expanded and rebuilt them. In 1952, it forced the Yoshida government to sign a so-called "Facilities and Areas" agreement, according to which Japan was to provide the United States with 612 facilities, including naval, land, and air force training grounds, naval bases, airfields, and barracks, of which 300 were for permanent use by the U.S. military. Currently, the number of bases and facilities occupied by the U.S. military in Japan has reached more than 800. On Japan's 369,800 square kilometers of land, there is an average of one U.S. military base facility every 500 square kilometers.

    In the Ryukyu Islands, which should be returned to Japan, the United States has long been determined to occupy them for a long time. On Okinawa, the United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building military bases; on the islands surrounding Okinawa, the United States has also built more than twenty large airfields. There is also a huge U.S. air force base on Iwo Jima. The Ogasawara Islands are also occupied by the United States and military bases have been established. On more than six hundred former Japanese-mandated islands scattered across three million square miles of the central Pacific, the United States, under the guise of a United Nations "trust," has established military bases there as important strongholds for controlling the Far East and Southeast Asia.

    In the Philippines, after the United States declared the Philippines "independent" in 1946, it forced the Philippines to lease twenty-three important land, sea, and air force bases to it for ninety-nine years. In June 1950, the United States signed a new base expansion agreement with the Philippines, obtaining the privilege of arbitrarily expanding military bases in the Philippines. The United States has now built more than thirty-five military bases on the Philippine archipelago.

    When the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it announced the occupation of Taiwan, our country's territory, and supported the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, who were spurned by the Chinese people, attempting to use Taiwan as a military springboard for aggression against our country.

    After the Korean armistice, the United States signed the U.S.-Rhee "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Rhee Syngman group. The treaty stipulates that the United States has the right to station land, sea, and air force units "indefinitely" in "the territory of or near" South Korea. In reality, the United States wants to permanently occupy South Korea as its military base.

    In the Indochina Peninsula, the United States, in 1949, used the so-called military aid agreement to obtain the right to use all military bases in Thailand, and constantly urged Thailand to accelerate the construction of various military facilities. A total of more than thirty airports have been expanded or are being expanded in Thailand. At the same time, the United States has recently sent more and more military personnel and aircraft to Indochina, directly interfering in the Indochina War, attempting to completely turn the French-occupied areas into U.S. bases. Singapore in Malaya also has U.S. air force stationed there.

    In India, the United States, according to the so-called "Mutual Assistance and Common Defense Treaty" signed with Portugal, is stepping up the establishment of military bases in Portuguese Goa, threatening India's security.

    In the South Pacific, the United States is building military bases in West Irian, the easternmost part of Indonesia. Islands adjacent to Australia, such as New Britain, New Ireland, and Manus, have long been seized by the United States as its military bases, and even Darwin, Coffs Harbour, Naromain Port in northern Australia, and Port Moresby in New Guinea have been given to the United States as naval and air force bases.

    The above is an overview of the U.S. military base network centered on Japan, extending from Alaska through the Aleutian Islands, Taiwan, and the Philippines, all the way to the Indian Ocean.

    The reactionary U.S. press frequently and unscrupulously trumpets the U.S.'s aggressive behavior of expanding military bases abroad. Wall Street's mouthpiece, "U.S. News & World Report," boasted on the U.S. Independence Day last year with the headline "The American Flag Doesn't Sleep," boasting that U.S. troops occupied forty-nine countries. At the end of last year, the magazine proudly proclaimed that almost half of the U.S. troops spent Christmas in sixty-three countries or territories abroad, twenty-two of which were in the Asia-Pacific region. It openly stated that "the Pacific is now dominated by the U.S. Navy" and that there are "more American armed forces stationed in Asia" than in Europe.

    However, the U.S. ruling clique is trying to cover up the true purpose of its unrestricted expansion of bases. They have always portrayed the military bases that the United States has established around the world as being for the "security" of the United States. However, no one would believe that the United States needs to turn foreign territories thousands or tens of thousands of miles away into its military bases for its own security. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson recently blatantly revealed the U.S.'s arrogant intention to invade Asia. He openly stated that the essence of the U.S.'s Far East policy is "to maintain the U.S.'s dominant position in the Far East indefinitely." It can be seen from this that the U.S. military base network in Asia and the Pacific is to realize its ambition to dominate Asia, vainly attempting to transform Asia into a hotbed for launching new wars.

    There is no doubt that the U.S.'s establishment of a base network in Asia and the Pacific is a part of its military base network established around the world, the purpose of which is to encircle the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. When the United States announced that it would permanently occupy Okinawa, the U.S. military commander on the island openly emphasized the strategic significance of Okinawa being less than 350 miles from the Chinese coast, and even threatened to turn Okinawa into a "springboard for atomic attacks" against China and the Soviet Union. U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford recently, when explaining the importance of the military bases on the Philippine archipelago, also drew an arc of flight distance from Subic Bay, which included some "historically strategic cities" on the Chinese mainland.

    In fact, the United States has already been using its military bases in Asia and the Pacific to carry out aggressive activities in the Far East. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, it used military bases adjacent to the Korean Peninsula to engage in the war. U.S. aircraft took off from airfields in Japan, Okinawa, and other places to carry out frenzied bombing of North Korea. Japanese ports were used to transport U.S. troops and supplies to Korea. Naval bases such as Sasebo in Kyushu and Keelung in Taiwan became anchorages for the U.S. invasion fleet. The United States is now actively using military bases in the Philippines and Thailand to interfere in the Indochina War. According to U.S. news agencies, the United States has recently been conducting large-scale airlift operations from Clark Air Base in the Philippines with increasing frequency to supply U.S. Air Force personnel participating in the Indochina War. "Business Week" also confirmed: "The United States is trying to support the area around Indochina as a supplement to the U.S. aid to the battlefield. Thailand occupies a key position in this strategy." These facts irrefutably prove that the U.S.'s establishment of a base network in Asia and the Pacific is a major step in the U.S.'s expansion of aggression in the Far East.

    The people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific are increasingly aware that the U.S. military bases are a serious threat to the security and peace of Asia and the Far East, and in particular, seriously endanger the independence, sovereignty, and security of the countries where the U.S. military bases are located. The U.S.'s establishment of military bases abroad is inseparable from its plan to station troops and control other countries abroad. Many countries where the United States has established military bases are not only under the direct occupation of U.S. troops, but the entire country is also controlled by the U.S. military. The country's defense plans, economic resources, and financial budget are inevitably subject to the U.S.'s strategic objectives of developing military bases. Japan, the Philippines, and other countries are examples. There, thousands of people have been displaced because their land was forcibly occupied to build U.S. military bases. In order to build various military facilities for the United States, Thailand has been forced to repeatedly increase its military budget, making military expenditures exceed more than 50% of the total budget. These countries are at risk of being dragged into war by the United States at any time, and threaten the security of neighboring countries. The United States can use this to put pressure on them and force them into the U.S. war bloc. It is for these reasons that the U.S.'s expansion of military bases in Asia and the Pacific has aroused strong opposition from the broad masses of people in various countries. The people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific resolutely demand that the United States stop expanding military bases and abolish all military bases, believing that this is an important measure to ensure peace and security in the Far East and the world.

    美国在亚洲及太平洋区域的军事基地威胁远东的和平与安全
    谭文瑞
    在日内瓦会议召开的前夕，一切关心亚洲及世界和平的人们都深切期望远东及世界的紧张局势将能获得进一步的缓和。但是美国统治集团不仅正在力图阻挠朝鲜问题的最后解决，加紧直接干涉和扩大印度支那战争，而且变本加厉地积极扩充和加强它在亚洲及太平洋区域的军事基地网。
    今年年初以来，美国统治集团为了推行其所谓加强“战略机动攻击力量”的所谓“新面貌”军事政策，加紧在中太平洋进行珍珠港、中途岛、关岛等地的军事建设工程，在西太平洋宣布将无限期占有冲绳岛作为军事据点，加速扩建菲律宾的克拉克机场和库比岬的海空军基地，并正向麦格赛赛政府施以压力，索取更多新的军事基地；同时，在东南亚，美国正在与巴基斯坦举行关于军事基地的谈判，并督促銮披汶政府改建十三个飞机场和在战略海岸线修筑一个新的海军基地。
    美国这种加紧在亚洲和太平洋扩建军事基地的活动，是和美国积极拼凑太平洋侵略集团及中东侵略集团的侵略计划联结在一起的。
    一九五三年年底美国海军部长安德逊公然声称：第二次大战前美国在太平洋上的“最前哨”是珍珠港，现在美国的边界已伸展到亚洲大陆，从朝鲜到台湾、印度支那、泰国而至缅甸了。这一狂妄言论，充分暴露了美国企图称霸亚洲与太平洋的凶恶面目。
    在第二次世界大战期间，美国在太平洋区域就已建立了二百多个不同规模和类型的军事基地。这几年来，美国继续在亚洲及太平洋地区建立了星罗棋布的军事基地网。
    美国占领日本以后，就将日本原有的海陆空军基地全部接管过来，并予以扩充和改建。一九五二年又强迫吉田政府签订了一项所谓“设施和区域”协定，根据这项协定，日本要向美国提供海、陆、空军演习场、海军基地、飞机场、兵营等设施六百十二处，其中由美军永久使用的有三百处。现在在日本被美军占用的基地和设施已共达八百处之多。日本全国三十六万九千八百余平方公里的土地上，平均每五百平方公里就有一处美军的基地设施。
    在应归还日本的琉球群岛，美国早就打定了长期占据的主意，在其中的冲绳岛上，美国用数亿美元修筑军事基地；在冲绳岛周围的岛屿上，美国也修了二十多个大型飞机场。在硫磺岛也有美国的一个巨大的空军基地。小笠原群岛同样被美国霸占并建立了军事基地。散布在太平洋中部三百万平方英里广阔海面的六百多个前日本委任统治的岛屿上，美国假借联合国的“委托”名义，在那里建立军事基地，作为控制远东及东南亚的重要据点。
    在菲律宾，美国于一九四六年宣布菲律宾“独立”后，即强迫菲律宾把二十三个重要的陆海空军基地租借给它九十九年。一九五○年六月，美国又与菲律宾签订一项新的扩充基地协定，取得了在菲律宾任意扩充军事基地的特权。现在美国在菲律宾群岛上修筑的军事基地实际上已有三十五处以上。
    美国发动侵略朝鲜战争时，宣布占领我国的领土台湾，扶植为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石残余匪帮，企图把台湾作为侵略我国的军事跳板。
    朝鲜停战后，美国与李承晚集团签订了美李“共同防御条约”，该条约规定美国有权“无限期”在南朝鲜“的领土上或是它的附近地区驻扎陆、海、空军部队”。实际上美国就是要永远占据南朝鲜作为它的军事基地。
    在中印半岛，美国于一九四九年利用所谓军事援助协定取得了使用泰国一切军事基地的权利，不断促使泰国加速修建各种军事设备，总计在泰国已扩建或正在扩建的机场有三十处之多。同时美国最近又派遣愈来愈多的军事人员、飞机到印度支那，直接干涉印度支那战争，企图把法国占领区完全变成美国的基地。马来亚的新加坡也驻有了美国的空军。
    在印度，美国根据和葡萄牙签订的所谓“互助与共同防御条约”，正在葡属果阿加紧建立军事基地，威胁着印度的安全。
    在南太平洋，美国正在印度尼西亚最东部的西伊里安建立军事基地。澳大利亚邻近的新不列颠、新爱尔兰、马纳斯等岛屿也早已被美国据为自己的军事基地，连澳大利亚本土北部的达尔文港、科夫斯港、纳罗马因港以及新几内亚的摩里斯比港等也已给美国作为海空军基地。
    以上就是美国以日本为中心，从阿拉斯加经过阿留申群岛、台湾、菲律宾，一直伸延到印度洋的军事基地网的概况。
    美国反动报刊经常毫无顾忌地大事吹嘘美国在国外扩充军事基地的侵略行为。华尔街的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”在去年美国独立纪念日的时候竟以“美国国旗不夜”为题夸耀美国军队占领着四十九个国家。去年年底这个杂志又洋洋得意地宣扬美国军队几乎有一半在国外六十三个国家或属领上渡过圣诞节，而其中有二十二处是在亚洲及太平洋区域。它公然说：“太平洋已为美国海军所支配”，而且有着比在欧洲“更多的美国武装力量驻扎在亚洲”。
    但是，美国统治集团却力图掩盖其无限制地扩充基地的真正目的。他们一向把美国在全球建立的军事基地说成是为了美国的“安全”。但是，谁也不会相信美国为了自己的安全，需要把几千里或几万里以外的外国领土变成它的军事基地。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊最近就露骨地表明了美国侵略亚洲的狂妄意图，他公然说：美国远东政策的实质就是“要在远东无限期地保持美国的统治地位”。由此可见，美国在亚洲及太平洋上的军事基地网就是为了实现其统治亚洲的野心，妄图重新把亚洲变成为发动新战争的温床。
    毫无疑问，美国在亚洲和太平洋地区建立基地网，是它在全世界建立的军事基地网的一个部分，其目的在于包围苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家。在美国宣布要永久占用冲绳岛的时候，美国在该岛的军事司令官就公开强调冲绳岛距离中国海岸不到三百五十英里的战略意义，甚至扬言要把冲绳岛变成为对中苏“进行原子进攻的跳板”。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福最近在说明菲律宾群岛上的军事基地的重要性时，也从苏比克湾画了一个飞行距离的弧形，这个弧形包括着中国大陆上一些“自古以来就有战略意义的城市”。
    事实上，美国已经在利用它在亚洲及太平洋地区的军事基地进行在远东的侵略活动。美国于一九五○年发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，就曾以朝鲜半岛邻近的军事基地来从事战争。美国的飞机从日本、冲绳岛等地的机场起飞对北朝鲜进行疯狂的轰炸，日本的港口曾被利用来输送美国侵朝部队及其给养，九州的佐世保和台湾的基隆等海军基地都成为了美国侵朝舰队的停泊所。美国现在又正在积极利用菲律宾和泰国等地上的军事基地来干涉印度支那战争。据美国通讯社透露，美国近来日益频繁地从菲律宾的克拉克机场进行大规模的空运，以供应参加印度支那战争的美国空军人员。美国“商业周刊”也证实：“美国正试图支持印度支那周围的地区来作为美国对于战场现场的援助的一种补充。泰国在这个战略中占着关键性的地位。”这些事实都无可辩驳地证明了，美国在亚洲及太平洋地区建立基地网，是美国在远东扩大侵略的主要步骤。
    亚洲及太平洋地区各国的人民愈来愈清楚地认识到，美国的军事基地是对亚洲和远东安全与和平的严重威胁，特别是严重地危害着美国军事基地所在的国家的独立主权与安全。美国在国外建立军事基地是和它在国外驻军和控制别国的计划不可分的。许多建立了美国的军事基地的国家，不仅处于美国军队的直接占领之下，而且整个国家也为美国军队所控制，这个国家的国防计划、经济资源和财政预算都不可免地要服从于美国发展军事基地的战略目的。日本、菲律宾等国就是例子，在那里成千上万的人民因为土地被强占用来修筑美国的军事基地而流离失所。为了替美国修筑各种军事设备，泰国被迫一再追加军事预算，使军事费用超过了全部预算的百分之五十以上。这些国家随时都有被美国卷入战争的危险，并威胁到邻近国家的安全，美国可以借此对它们施以压力，强迫把它们拖进美国的战争集团之中。正是因为这样的原因，美国在亚洲和太平洋地区扩张军事基地，激起了各国广大人民的强烈反对。亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民坚决要求美国停止扩充军事基地并撤消所有的军事基地，认为这是保证远东及世界和平和安全的重要措施。（附图片）
