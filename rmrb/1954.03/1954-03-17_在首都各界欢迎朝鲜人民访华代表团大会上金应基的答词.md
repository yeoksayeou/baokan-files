Dear comrades:
	This time, our Korean People's Delegation to China is visiting your country to see the brilliant achievements of the brotherly Chinese people in their solemn labor struggle to carry out socialist construction, to further consolidate the traditional friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China cemented in blood, and to further promote cultural exchanges between the people of Korea and China.
	The Korean People's Delegation to China, visiting the great neighbor—the People's Republic of China, expresses its infinite gratitude and feels supreme honor for the warm welcome and friendly congratulations given to us by the Chinese people.
	On behalf of our delegation, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the leaders of various political parties and social organizations in China, and through you, comrades, to the brotherly people of China, and I would like to extend my greatest respect to the great leader of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao Zedong.
	Since ancient times, the people of China and Korea have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship in the righteous common struggle against foreign imperialist aggressors.
	This historical friendship between our two peoples has been further consolidated and developed in the just war of liberation of the Korean people against the American armed aggressors and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, and has shown its invincible strength.
	In the most difficult period of our country and people, the brotherly Chinese people held high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, gave us great material and moral assistance, and sent the mighty Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their finest sons and daughters, to the Korean front to aid us with their blood.
	With the internationalist support of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union and the assistance of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army won a historic victory, gloriously defending the independence and freedom of our glorious motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
	This victory not only defended our country's independence and freedom, consolidated China's security, and dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialists' plot to launch a new war, but also created extremely favorable conditions for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the easing of international tensions.
	This victory also demonstrated the mighty strength of the socialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, united under the banner of proletarian internationalism, and confirmed the great strength and indomitable spirit of the people who rose up to wage a just struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland.
	The Resist-America and Aid-Korea movement launched by the brotherly Chinese people and the participation of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean front became a model of noble proletarian internationalism.
	The brave commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers fought shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army in our just war, overcoming all kinds of difficulties, displaying unparalleled heroism and boldness, and bravely repelling the enemy.
	Together with the Korean People's Army, the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteers displayed a high degree of military art and showed the power of certain victory in the five battles, in repelling the enemy's summer and autumn offensive operations, in the famous Shangganling defensive battle, and in the large-scale counterattack in the area south of JinCheng.
	The noble internationalist fighters—the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers—regarded the misfortunes of the Korean people as their own, participated in the just war against the US imperialist armed aggressors, and waged selfless struggles to defend every inch of our country's land, establishing immortal merits and achievements.
	The Korean people firmly remember the names of Comrade Huang Jiguang, Chen Jimo, Li Jiafa, Li Shijie, and other comrades, outstanding sons of the Chinese people, who blocked the enemy's fire outlets with their own bodies to ensure the victory of our army.
	In the two years and nine months since the Chinese People's Volunteers participated in the Korean front, they have cultivated more than 302,000 meritorious individuals, led by Comrades Yang Gensi, Gao Yunhe, Qiu Shaoyun, and Sun Zhanyuan, and more than 350,000 commanders and fighters of the Volunteers have been awarded medals and badges of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and nine have been awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
	The Korean people will never forget the great assistance given to us by the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteers in the just war of liberation of our country, and we will praise the great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers with deep gratitude, respect, and friendship for thousands of generations.
	The heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, both at the front and in the rear, regarded the fate of the Korean people as their own, economized on their own military rations, distributed them to our war-torn disaster victims who were displaced by the enemy's barbaric atrocities, and used the intervals between battles to help farmers with production, and also helped the Korean people with medical treatment.
	During the three-year war, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers distributed more than 5,000 tons of grain, more than 330,000 sets of clothes, more than 110,000 pairs of shoes, and more than 6,000 kilograms of cotton to our war-torn disaster victims, and helped farmers with spring plowing, sowing, transplanting rice seedlings, weeding, harvesting, and threshing, covering an area of more than 357,000 "chongbo." They also repaired 2,226 river embankments, 7,565 bridges, and rescued more than 3,700 Korean people.
	The heroic deeds of the internationalist fighters—Martyrs Luo Shengjiao and Shi Yuanhou—have increasingly increased the devout feelings of our people.
	We, the Korean people, are moved by the noble selfless spirit and moral qualities of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers, and from here we see the noble qualities of the outstanding people educated and cultivated by the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong.
	Today, the entire Korean people cherish the Volunteer soldiers like their own brothers, just as they cherish the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and spare no effort to support them.
	In the Battle of Shangganling, more than 8,000 people from the three counties of Jinhua, Huaiyang, and Pinggang braved the enemy's bombing and shelling to help the Volunteers with transportation, contributing to the victory of the battle; in the Battle of Yuefeishan, 113 women from Yangcun Village braved the enemy's bombing to carry artillery shells to the Volunteers, organized blood transfusion teams, and transfused blood to the wounded Volunteers, saving the heroic Volunteers.
	The righteous action of farmer Park Jae-geun, who protected the wounded Volunteer soldiers with his own body, fully illustrates the noble internationalist friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China.
	This deep friendship and unity between our two peoples is a noble quality that only people who are united for a just common cause can possess. Indeed, there is nothing more precious to us than this.
	Dear comrades: After the war, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the respected leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, launched a nationwide struggle to rapidly restore and develop the people's economy that had been devastated by the war, strengthen our country's political, economic, and military power, and complete the peaceful unification and independence of the motherland.
	The assistance of the people of the people's democratic countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the huge assistance of 8 billion yuan given to us by the brotherly Chinese people have become the guarantee of victory and achievement in the struggle of our people to restore and build the post-war people's economy, and are a powerful force to encourage the Korean people to establish new labor feats.
	The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers also displayed a selfless spirit in the struggle to restore and build the post-war people's economy in our country, helping us to rebuild factories, rural areas, schools, and bridges in their spare time, and a large number of Chinese technicians provided technical assistance on construction sites in our country.
	With the enthusiastic support and assistance of the world's peace-loving democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the Korean people have made every effort to restore from the wounds of war, stabilize and improve the people's lives, and effectively strengthen the democratic base in the seven months since the armistice.
	At present, in every corner of our country, new factories, beautiful cities, rural areas, and educational and cultural facilities are gradually being built on the ruins, and the people are creating new lives in the prospect of a broad future.
	However, we will never be dizzy with the victories and achievements we have already achieved.
	As is well known, at present the US imperialist aggressors are unwilling to accept the lessons of their shameful defeat, and are carrying out various conspiracies and tricks in order to realize their ambitions of aggression. We have long seen this fact clearly, and we have directly experienced it. Therefore, all the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the brotherly commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers are guarding every outpost with a high degree of vigilance and tension.
	There is no doubt that if the US imperialists obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and carry out new adventurous actions against the people of China and Korea, then the united strength of the people of China and Korea, cemented in blood, will give them an even heavier blow.
	As long as our people rely on the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union, they will surely win the final victory in the struggle for the peace, unification, and independence of the motherland.
	Dear comrades!
	We Korean people are infinitely proud to have forged a fraternal friendship with the great Chinese people.
	We are confident that the further development of the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea will contribute to the great cause of our two peoples creating their own free and happy lives and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.
	We Korean people rejoice at the brilliant achievements made by the great Chinese people in the struggle to build a prosperous and strong People's China, just as we rejoice at our own achievements.
	The Korean people have always strived to strengthen the friendship, unity, and cultural exchange between the people of Korea and China under the banner of proletarian internationalism.
	The Korean People's Delegation to China and the Art Troupe will convey the congratulations and gratitude of the Korean people to the brotherly Chinese people, convey the art of the Korean people, and at the same time, learn from the heroism and creativity displayed by the great Chinese people in the Resist-America and Aid-Korea movement and in the struggle to implement the Five-Year Plan, learn from the excellent culture and art of the Chinese people, and bring it back to our motherland to convey to our Korean people.
	Our Korean People's Delegation to China sincerely wishes the brotherly Chinese people greater victories and achievements in the implementation of the great plan to build socialism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the respected leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.
	Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea!
	Long live the invincible internationalist friendship and unity of the people of all countries in the world peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!
	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the respected leader of the Chinese people!
	Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!
	Long live the great Soviet people and the Soviet government and Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union!

    在首都各界欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团大会上金应基的答词
    亲爱的同志们：
    这次，我们朝鲜人民访华代表团来贵国访问，为的是要参观兄弟般的中国人民在进行社会主义建设的庄严的劳动斗争中所获得的灿烂的成果，进一步巩固朝中两国人民以鲜血结成的传统的友谊团结，进一步促进朝中两国人民的文化交流。
    访问伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国的我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，对中国人民给予我们的热烈的欢迎与友谊的祝贺，表示无限的感激，并感到无上的光荣。
    我们代表团一行，向中国共产党，中华人民共和国政府，中国各政党、社会团体的各位领导者，并通过各位同志向兄弟般的全中国人民，致以深深的感谢，同时谨向中国人民的伟大领袖——毛泽东主席致以最大的崇敬。
    很早以来，中朝两国人民在抗击外来帝国主义者的正义的共同斗争中，凝结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。
    我们两国人民的这种历史友谊，在朝鲜人民反对美国武装侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮的正义的祖国解放战争中更加巩固并发展起来，并且显示了它的不可战胜的力量。
    在我们祖国与人民处于最艰苦的时期，兄弟般的中国人民高举起抗美援朝的旗帜，在物质上、道义上莫大地援助了我们，而且向朝鲜前线派遣自己最优秀的儿女组成的强大的中国人民志愿军，以鲜血援助了我们。
    朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在以伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的国际主义支援和英雄的中国人民志愿军的援助下，获得了历史性的胜利，光辉地保卫了我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立与自由。
    这个胜利，不仅是保卫了我国的独立与自由，巩固了中国的安全，给予美帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋以沉重的打击，而且在和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张局势方面，造成了极其有利的条件。
    这个胜利，又显示了在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下团结起来的以苏联为首的社会主义民主阵营的强大力量，并且证实了为捍卫自己祖国的自由与独立而奋起进行正义斗争的人民的伟大力量和不屈不挠的精神。
    兄弟般的中国人民所开展的抗美援朝运动与英雄的中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜前线作战，成了崇高的无产阶级国际主义的榜样。
    英勇的中国人民志愿军指战员们，在我们的正义战争中，和朝鲜人民军将士们肩并肩，手拉手，克服千难万苦，发挥了无比英勇与大胆精神，勇敢地击退了敌人。
    兄弟般的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，在五次的战役中，在击退敌人的夏季和秋季攻势作战中、著名的上甘岭防御战及金城以南地区大反击战中，发挥高度的军事艺术，显示了必胜的威力。
    高尚的国际主义战士——英雄的中国人民志愿军勇士们把朝鲜人民的不幸看做是自己的不幸，参加反对美帝国主义武装侵略者的正义战争，为了保卫我们祖国的每一寸土地，展开忘我的斗争，建树了不朽的功勋和业绩。
    朝鲜人民牢牢地记着：以自己的身躯堵塞了敌人的火口，保证了我军部队胜利的中国人民的优秀男儿——特级英雄黄继光、陈继模、李家发、李世杰等同志的名字。
    中国人民志愿军参加朝鲜前线作战两年九个月以来，培养了以杨根思、高云和、邱少云、孙占元等同志为首的立功者三十万两千多名，三十五万多名志愿军指战员荣获了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的勋章与奖章，九名荣获了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄的称号。
    朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记兄弟般的中国人民志愿军在我们祖国的正义解放战争中给予我们的莫大的援助，我们将千秋万代地以深厚的感谢、尊敬与友谊的心情来歌颂中国人民志愿军指战员们建立的丰功伟绩。
    英雄的中国人民志愿军指战员们在前线与后方，把朝鲜人民的命运看做是自己的命运，节约自己的军粮，分配给遭受敌人的野蛮暴行而流离失所的我们的战区灾民，并利用战斗间隙，帮助农民生产，在医疗上也帮助了朝鲜人民。
    在三年战争期间，中国人民志愿军指战员们将五千多吨粮食、三十三万多套衣服、十一万多双鞋、六千多公斤棉花分给了我们的战区灾民，并帮助农民春耕播种、插秧、除草、收割打场，其面积达三十五万七千多町步，他们还抢修了两千二百二十六处河堤，七千五百六十五座桥梁，并且抢救了三千七百多名朝鲜人民。
    国际主义战士——罗盛教、史元厚烈士的壮举，越来越使我们人民增加虔敬的心情。
    我们朝鲜人民为志愿军指战员们的高尚的忘我精神与道德品质所感动，从这里我们看到了光荣的中国共产党与毛泽东主席教育并培养起来的优秀的人们的崇高的品质。
    今天，全朝鲜人民像爱护朝鲜人民军将士一样，亲兄弟般地爱护志愿军战士们，并用尽一切力量来支援他们。
    在上甘岭战斗中，金化、淮阳、平康等三个郡的八千多人民，冒着敌人的轰炸和炮击，帮助志愿军进行运输工作，对战斗的胜利作出了贡献；在月飞山战斗中，杨村里一百十三名妇女，冒着敌人的轰炸，给志愿军搬运炮弹，组织输血队，给志愿军伤员输血，拯救了志愿军勇士。
    用自己的身躯保护志愿军伤员的农民朴在根的正义行动，充分说明了朝中两国人民的高尚的国际主义友谊和团结。
    我们两国人民之间的这种深厚的友谊和团结，是只有为正义的共同事业而团结在一起的人们才会具有的高尚的品质。的确，对我们来说没有比这个还珍贵的。
    亲爱的同志们：战后，朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅领导下，展开了全民的斗争，迅速恢复和发展遭受战争创伤的人民经济，加强我国的政治、经济和军事威力，完成祖国的和平统一与独立。
    以伟大的苏联为首的各人民民主国家人民的援助与兄弟般的中国人民给予我们的八万亿元的巨大援助，在我国人民恢复和建设战后人民经济的斗争中成为争取胜利和成就的保证，是大力鼓舞朝鲜人民建立新的劳动功勋的力量。
    中国人民志愿军指战员在我国恢复建设战后人民经济的斗争中，也利用空隙，发挥忘我精神，帮助我们重建工厂、农村、学校、桥梁，中国的大批技术人员在我国建设工地上给予技术上的帮助。
    朝鲜人民得到以伟大苏联为首的全世界爱好和平民主阵营的热烈支持与援助，在停战后不过七个月期间，尽一切努力恢复战争创伤，安定和提高了人民生活，并有成效地进行着加强民主基地的工作。
    目前，在我们祖国的每个角落，新的工厂、美丽的城市、农村和教育文化设施，正在废墟上逐渐建立起来，人民在对于未来的广阔前途的展望中创造新的生活。
    但是，我们绝不会为已获得的胜利和成就冲昏头脑。
    如所周知，目前美帝国主义侵略者不甘心接受可耻的失败教训，为了实现它的侵略野心，正进行各种阴谋诡计。这个事实，我们早就看清楚了，而且直接体验过了。所以全体朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军将士们，以高度的警惕性和紧张的姿态守卫着每个前哨。
    毫无疑问，如果美帝国主义者阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，进行反对中朝人民的新的冒险行动，那么以鲜血凝结成的中朝两国人民的团结力量，将给予他们以更沉重的打击。
    我国人民只要依靠以伟大的苏联为首的全世界和平民主阵营，为祖国和平、统一、独立的斗争，就必定会争取到最后的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们朝鲜人民因为和伟大的中国人民结成兄弟般的友谊关系而感到无限骄傲。
    我们确信，中朝两国人民的友谊团结的进一步发展，将有助于我们两国人民创造自己的自由、幸福的生活和维护亚洲及世界和平的伟大事业。
    我们朝鲜人民对于伟大的中国人民在建设富强的人民中国的斗争中所获得的辉煌成就，像自己的成就一样感到欣喜。
    朝鲜人民在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下，一贯为加强朝中两国人民的友谊团结和文化交流而努力。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团和艺术团，向兄弟般的中国人民传达朝鲜人民的祝贺与感谢，传达朝鲜人民的艺术，同时，学习伟大的中国人民在抗美援朝运动和实行五年计划的斗争中所发挥的英雄主义和创造精神，学习中国人民的优秀的文化艺术，带到祖国去传达给我们朝鲜人民。
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团衷心地预祝兄弟般的中国人民在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，在实行建设社会主义的伟大计划中获得更大的胜利和成就。
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的全世界和平民主社会主义阵营各国人民的战无不胜的国际主义友谊团结万岁！
    中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府及苏联部长会议主席马林科夫同志万岁！
