    Welcome You, Heroic People
    Volunteer Railway Worker Aiding Korea, Cai Xuepeng
    The train speeds freely across the motherland's land. It delivers countless materials to factories and construction sites, countless products to rural areas and cities, and countless people to various fighting and working positions. Returning to the motherland, every time I see this scene, I think of the fighting Korea, and the Korean people who fought with me at the train station. Especially when they sent their heroic sons and daughters to visit our country, these memories become more numerous and more intimate, as if I am still fighting alongside them.
    In Korea, I worked for a long time at the Seogam Train Station in Daedong County, South Pyongan Province. This was one of the enemy's blockade lines. Enemy planes poured countless tons of steel down, trying to stop the trains supporting the victory here. However, the Korean people and we together, with our own courage and wisdom, overcame the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, ensuring the smooth flow of trains, and turning Seogam Train Station into a steel-like link on the indestructible and unceasing steel transportation line.
    It was the night of February 5, 1952. The station received a phone call, saying that a train full of gasoline was going to pass through here and head to the front lines. That night, the moonlight was particularly bright, and with the snow everywhere, it was almost like daytime. We all knew that this would bring greater difficulties to our task of ensuring the train's safety. Stationmaster Han Bingyun, a Korean comrade and member of the Workers' Party, was strong, brave, and resourceful. He led everyone in preparing for battle in advance. No matter what, we had to ensure that this train passed through here safely. The train finally passed through Seogam Station safely, but just over ten minutes later, there was a booming sound in the sky. An enemy plane came over. Circling, diving, strafing… Suddenly, a red glow appeared where the plane bombed. Obviously, the gasoline on the train had been ignited. Comrade Han Bingyun immediately ordered everyone to rescue. Running in the front was a Korean young man in his twenties, named Kim Younghwan, a member of the Workers' Party. He was the first to bravely dive under the burning car, unhooked the coupling, and worked with everyone to push away the cars behind, rescuing the remaining supplies and ensuring supplies for the front lines.
    In this way, enemy planes bombed and strafed wildly time after time, and the Korean people and we together, rescued, repaired, and transported time after time. Our station had no accidents in the entire year of 1952, and all tasks were overfulfilled. Many Korean comrades and Chinese comrades were commended, and I also received a military medal awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The military medal is still worn on my chest. Seeing it, I think of those hard-fought days at Seogam Train Station, I think of Han Bingyun, Kim Younghwan, and the heroic Korean people, and therefore, it adds to my working strength. I am the deputy stationmaster of Xizhimen Train Station in Beijing. In January and February of this year, our station overfulfilled its production targets, saving the country over 910 million yuan in wealth. We have full confidence, learning the spirit of the Korean people's heroic struggle, to make even greater achievements in March!
    Now, representatives of the heroic Korean people have arrived in our capital—Beijing. Welcome you, heroic people! We once fought on the front lines against a common enemy; in the future, we will always be with you, advancing together in the cause of building our own country and defending world peace!

    欢迎你，英雄的人们
    志愿援朝铁路工人　蔡学鹏
    列车，在祖国的大地上自由地飞驰。它把无数材料送到工厂和建设工地，把无数产品送到了农村和城市，把无数的人们送到各个不同的战斗和工作岗位上。回到祖国，我一看到这种情景，就想起战斗的朝鲜，想起和我一起在火车站战斗过的朝鲜人民。特别在他们派出了自己的英雄子弟到我国来访问的时候，这种回忆就更多，也觉得更亲切，好像我现在仍然和他们战斗在一起一样。
    在朝鲜，我长期地工作在平安南道大同郡石岩火车站。这里，是敌人的封锁线之一，敌机把无数的钢铁倾泻下来，想把支援胜利的火车挡在这里。可是，朝鲜人民和我们一起，用自己的英勇和智慧战胜了敌人的滥炸，保证了火车的畅通，把石岩火车站变成了打不烂炸不断的钢铁运输线上一个钢铁般的环节。
    是一九五二年二月五日的夜晚，站上接到电话通知，说是一列满载着汽油的火车要从这里通过，开到前线去。这天晚上，月色格外明亮，再映着遍地的积雪，简直像白天一样。我们都知道，这将给我们保证列车安全的任务带来更大的困难。站长韩炳允，是个朝鲜同志，劳动党员，他坚强、勇敢、机智，事先就带领大家做好了战斗的准备。无论如何也要让这列火车安全地通过这里。列车终于安全地通过了石岩站，但刚过去十多分钟，天空中就发出了轰轰的巨响。一架敌机过来了。盘旋，俯冲，扫射……。突然，在飞机轰炸的地方，冒起一片红光，显然是列车上的汽油被打着了。韩炳允同志马上命令大家去抢救。跑在最前面的是一个二十多岁的朝鲜小伙子，叫金永焕，劳动党员。他首先奋不顾身地钻进那个着火的车皮下面，摘开了车钩，和大家一起推开了后面的车皮，救出了剩余的物资，保证了前线的供应。
    就这样，敌机一次一次地狂轰滥炸，朝鲜人民和我们一起，一次一次地抢救、抢修、抢运。我们那个站一九五二年全年没出事故，各项工作都超额完成了任务。很多朝鲜同志和中国同志都立了功，我还得到了一枚朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的军功章。军功章直到现在还戴在我的胸上。看到它，就想起了石岩火车站那些艰苦战斗的日子，就想起了韩炳允、金永焕和英雄的朝鲜人民，因而也就增添了工作力量。我是北京市西直门火车站的副站长，今年一、二月份我们站上都超额完成了生产指标，为国家节约了九亿一千多万元的财富。我们有充分的信心，学习朝鲜人民英勇斗争的精神，在三月份做出更大的成绩来！
    现在，英雄朝鲜人民的代表，已经到达我们的首都——北京了。欢迎你，英雄的人们！我们曾经在反对共同敌人的战线上战斗过；今后我们还要永远和你们一起，在建设自己的国家、保卫世界和平的事业中共同前进！
