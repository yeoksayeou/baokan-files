Deeply Understand Grain Shortages, Vigorously Promote Grain Policies
	Longpingtou Township, Taigu County Begins Grain Unified Sales Work

After Longpingtou Township in the Fifth District of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, completed the grain planned purchase work and concentrated grain transportation, the working cadres returned to the county town for a meeting, failing to carry out grain planned supply work in a timely manner, which caused ideological concerns among some people. Many grain-deficient households demanded immediate grain supply, and some grain-surplus households also cried out that they had no grain. Out of the township's 344 households, initially only a few households indicated a shortage of one or two months' grain, but later this developed to more than 60 households demanding immediate supply, requiring a total of over 20,000 jin of grain.

After local working cadres discovered this situation, they promptly went to the grassroots level to further understand the actual grain shortage of the farmers and comprehensively publicized the national grain purchase and sales policy. They first went to Aonao Village, where the calls for grain shortage were the loudest, to understand the situation. Through household visits, understanding thoughts, and explaining policies to dispel concerns, they learned that the grain shortage in this village was not as serious as claimed. A few households were genuinely short of grain, while some households simply wanted the state to supply some grain "just in case." After local working cadres thoroughly publicized the national grain policy in this village, the number of households requiring grain supply in the village of 22 households decreased from the original eight to two; the amount of grain required decreased from 2,000 jin to 400 jin. Fan Fugen originally requested immediate grain supply, but at this time, his mother even personally guided the cadres to see his family's grain reserves, indicating that there was no problem with the family's consumption. After clarifying this situation, local working cadres convened a township-wide cadre meeting, using real people and events for publicity and education. Later, all villages in the township comprehensively publicized the grain unified purchase and sales policy and understood the grain shortage situation. The number of households requiring grain supply decreased to 28 households, requiring only 6,000 jin of grain. Households with surplus grain beyond the unified purchase were originally afraid of being said to be backward and did not dare to sell grain. At this time, after learning that surplus grain could be sold to the state grain departments and cooperatives, or traded in the state grain market, they continued to sell surplus grain. In the most recent month and a half, farmers in the township sold more than 5,000 jin of surplus grain to cooperatives, accounting for more than 83 percent of the amount of grain required by grain-deficient households throughout the township for the whole year. Based on this situation, through adjustments by the state grain market, grain departments, and cooperatives, the grain shortage problem in the township can be basically resolved. Currently, the township is issuing supply certificates in accordance with government regulations in order to carry out grain supply in a planned manner.

    深入了解缺粮情况，大力宣传粮食
    政策太谷县龙坪头乡开始进行粮食统销工作
    山西省太谷县第五区龙坪头乡深入了解农民缺粮情况，大力宣传国家粮食政策，使粮食计划供应工作迅速走上正轨。
    龙坪头乡完成粮食计划收购工作，将粮食调运集中以后，工作干部即回县城开会，没有及时进行粮食计划供应工作，部分群众产生了思想顾虑。不少缺粮户要求立即供应粮食，有些余粮户也叫喊没有粮食。全乡三百四十四户，开始只有少数户表示缺一两个月的粮食，后来发展到有六十多户要求马上供应，共需粮约二万余斤。
    当地工作干部发现这一情况以后，及时深入下层，进一步了解农民实际缺粮情况，并全面地宣传了粮食统购统销政策。他们首先到叫喊缺粮最厉害的鳌脑村了解情况。通过谈家务、了解思想、讲政策解除顾虑，了解到这个村的缺粮情况并不像叫喊的那么严重，有少数户真正缺粮，有些户只是想让国家供应些粮食，“以防万一”。当地工作干部在这个村深入宣传了国家粮食政策以后，全村二十二户中，要求供应粮食的户由原来的八户减少为两户；要求供应粮食的数量，由两千斤减少为四百斤。范福根原来要求立即供应粮食，这时候，他母亲还亲自引导干部看了他家的存粮，表示全家吃用没有问题。在摸清这一情况以后，当地工作干部召开了全乡干部会议，用活人活事进行宣传教育。后来，全乡各村都全面地宣传了粮食统购统销政策，并了解了缺粮情况。全乡要求供应粮食的户减少到二十八户，只需要六千斤粮食。统购以外还有余粮的户，原来怕别人说落后，不敢卖粮，这时了解了有余粮可以卖给国家粮食部门和合作社，或到国家粮食市场进行交易等政策以后，又继续出卖余粮。在最近一个半月内，全乡农民又卖给合作社五千多斤余粮，占全乡全年缺粮户要求供应粮食数的百分之八十三以上。根据这种情况，通过国家粮食市场和粮食部门、合作社进行调剂，全乡缺粮问题即可基本解决。目前，全乡正按政府规定填发供应证，以便有计划地进行粮食供应。
