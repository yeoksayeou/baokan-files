What are the Advantages of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Ke Keming Yang Ye

    "Individual households are like ox carts, mutual aid groups are like cars, and agricultural production cooperatives are like trains," "Individual farming is not as good as mutual aid, and mutual aid is not as good as cooperation," has become a fact that many farmers have personally experienced and that a wider range of farmers have witnessed. Why does everyone say that agricultural production cooperatives are good? The most important thing is that they can increase agricultural output, increase the income of cooperative members; they can also make all farmers prosperous together, and lead farmers step by step towards socialism.

    Cooperatives can Carry out Relatively Large-Scale Production

    If everyone compares the local agricultural production cooperatives with mutual aid groups and individual households, and compares the members' situation after joining the cooperative with their situation before joining, they can see: except for a very small number of poorly managed cooperatives, most cooperatives have increased their production, and can improve it year by year. What is the reason for this? Mainly because agricultural production cooperatives implement unified management, the organization of collective labor is more reasonable, and public property is more abundant than mutual aid groups, which provides conditions for carrying out relatively large-scale production.

    When land is handed over to the cooperative for unified use, land fertility can be more fully utilized. When families operate separately, they have to "plant whatever they need to eat," and plant many kinds of crops on a small piece of land; if the soil is suitable for growing corn, they have to grow some millet and beans in order to eat millet and beans; if the soil is suitable for growing cotton, they have to grow rice in order to eat rice. In this way, land fertility is limited. After unified use of land, whatever crop the soil is suitable for growing will be planted, and naturally more grain and cotton can be harvested; large areas of the same crop are also easier to manage. When families operate separately, there are many field ridges, ditch banks, and land corners, which take up a lot of land. After unified use of land, land boundaries can be broken, and the cultivated area can be expanded. According to statistics from thirteen cooperatives in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, after breaking land boundaries, the cultivated area was expanded by 444 mu; calculated at 200 jin of raw grain per mu, more than 88,000 jin of grain can be harvested. When families operate separately, the plots are too small, it is not easy to use larger new-style farm tools, it is not easy to build larger-scale water conservancy facilities, and in paddy field areas, disputes often arise among households over water use; after unified use of land, these things become easier to handle.

    When land is handed over to the cooperative for unified use, it becomes more convenient to improve technology. When families operate separately, each family has very little land and does not dare to boldly conduct experiments to improve technology. When land is managed in a unified way, allocating a small portion of land for experiments will not have a significant impact on everyone's income even if it fails, and everyone's conservative ideas will naturally be easier to break. When families operate separately, no matter what kind of fertilizer they use, they apply it all to their small plots of land, and it is difficult to apply different fertilizers according to different soil types. When land is managed in a unified way and fertilizer is also used in a unified way, different fertilizers can be applied according to different soil types, so the effect of the fertilizer is greater. When families operate separately, each family does not necessarily have good seeds, it is easy to mix them up when exchanging them, and it is very troublesome, wastes work time, and is disadvantageous. After unified use of land, the entire cooperative can uniformly select seeds, and keep the seeds of the crops that grow best, are resistant to disasters and diseases, and have high yields, which is also very important for increasing production. For example, in 1953, more than 90% of the agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province established "small farms" and "seed retention plots" for experimenting with improved technology, and all used superior varieties; more than 90% of the land in each cooperative implemented appropriate close planting; fertilization, irrigation, and other technologies also had many improvements. In this way, how could production not increase?

    When labor is used in a unified way by the cooperative, and a certain amount of remuneration is given according to labor, labor efficiency is more easily improved. When families work separately, they cannot take care of everything, and often waste a lot of energy and effort; it is difficult for one person to be a "jack of all trades," and they always have some farm work that they cannot do well; some semi-laborers or people who are frail, disabled, or ill in the family often cannot get involved in field work and have to stay idle. After unified use of labor, there are special personnel responsible for planning and arranging work, and dividing labor according to each person's expertise, which can achieve "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their special abilities," and do all kinds of farm work and sideline work better; semi-laborers and frail and disabled people can also have light work such as feeding livestock and taking care of children to do, which can free up more full laborers to do more things to increase production. Because a certain method of remuneration according to labor is implemented, the more and better someone works, the more income they receive, and the more respected they are by everyone, and everyone's enthusiasm for labor is higher. In this way, all kinds of work can be done better and faster. According to a typical survey by the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the labor efficiency of agricultural production cooperatives is about 15% higher than that of mutual aid groups. In this way, there can be more strength to carry out land processing and water conservancy construction. For example, 112 cooperatives in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, dug 105 wells and renovated 21 canals after the establishment of the cooperatives, ensuring that all the land in the cooperatives could be irrigated and expanding the area of paddy fields by more than 5,500 mu. In this way, there is also more strength to fight against natural disasters. In addition to fundamentally conquering disasters through water conservancy construction and technological improvement, even if natural disasters are encountered, the cooperative has a large number of people and great strength, and can mobilize all its forces to overcome or mitigate the disasters. For example, the Geng Changsuo Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, successively defeated four disasters of drought, wind, flood, and insects in 1953, and the average yield of all land was more than 300 jin of grain per mu, which was more than one-third higher than the average yield of ordinary individual farmers in the area. In this way, technology is also easier to improve. Because the division of labor in the cooperative is detailed, and each person specializes in one profession, which makes them skilled; there are also more people discussing things together, and more people have more wisdom; and because the efficiency of work is high, everyone also has the effort and interest to put their minds to improving technology.

    With a considerable amount of public property, the cooperative can do bigger things. Such as building larger-scale water conservancy facilities and buying complete sets of new-style farm tools, which are fundamentally impossible when families operate separately, and are not easy to do in mutual aid groups; they are relatively easy to do in cooperatives.

    Unified land management, unified labor use, a certain degree of remuneration according to labor, and a certain amount of public property are all socialist factors in agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives can carry out relatively large-scale production and increase production more because of these socialist factors; these socialist factors increase year by year, so they can increase production more year by year.

    Cooperatives can Enable all Farmers to become Prosperous Together

    In the past, landlords and some wealthy farmers, they could also manage relatively large-scale agricultural production. However, the larger the scale they did it, the more people would be impoverished. This is because they monopolized the land, they did not work themselves or worked very little, and lived entirely or mainly by exploitation. People without land would naturally be exploited by them; even some farmers with land, because they were weak and could not withstand the blows of natural and man-made disasters, would inevitably borrow high-interest loans, work as hired laborers, and be exploited by landlords, usurers, and wealthy farmers, or even sell all their land when their lives were difficult. After liberation, through land reform, the landlords' land was confiscated; farmers were no longer exploited by landlords, and were less exploited by wealthy farmers. However, each farmer's small plot of land still could not stabilize production and life, and natural disasters and death from illness would still bankrupt many farmers; wealthy farmers, usurers, and a very small number of farmers with better conditions would then take the opportunity to exploit farmers in difficulty.

    Large-scale agriculture by landlords and wealthy farmers naturally cannot make farmers prosperous; because although it is large-scale, it is exploiting people. The small-scale peasant economy cannot make farmers prosperous together; because it will give rise to exploitation, and it is scattered, extremely small-scale, has many difficulties, cannot resist disasters, and is not convenient for improving technology. Only cooperative agriculture can prevent everyone from being exploited and can continuously increase production, so it can make all farmers prosperous together.

    If everyone looks at the actual situation in their local area, they will know more clearly. In places where there are no or few mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the phenomenon of differentiation between rich and poor is more common; in places where more mutual aid and cooperation organizations have developed, especially where agricultural production cooperatives have developed, there are few cases of differentiation between rich and poor, and generally speaking, the lives of all households that have joined the cooperatives are rising year by year. The very difficult "households in difficulty" problem is also easier to solve with larger agricultural production cooperatives.

    Cooperatives are Convenient for Combining with the National Economy

    In the case of a single household being an economic unit, all plans are made by the family in terms of both production and consumption. What crops are suitable to plant can only be considered from the needs of their own family, and cannot be considered from the needs of the country. In this way, it is possible that some things are planted too much and some things are planted too little, which is ultimately detrimental to both the country and themselves. What things they need at home may not be available when they need them. It is impossible for national factories to ask each household what they need, so it is difficult to decide how much of each thing should be produced, and it is possible that some things are produced too much and some things are produced too little; which is ultimately detrimental to both the country and the farmers.

    Agricultural production cooperatives unite many families, and it is more convenient to connect with the national economy. The state signs contracts with agricultural production cooperatives through supply and marketing cooperatives. The agricultural production cooperative needs something, which is specified in the contract, and the supply and marketing cooperative can supply it according to plan at a certain time; the state needs grain and industrial raw materials, which are specified in the contract, and the agricultural production cooperative can carry out production according to plan. In this way, it is easier for farmers to buy what they need, and the things they produce will not be unsalable or sold at low prices. In this way, it is of great benefit to both the country and the farmers.

    Agricultural production cooperatives unite many families, and it is more convenient for the state to help farmers. It is much more convenient for the state bank to lend to cooperatives than to lend to many families. It is more inconvenient for the state's new farm implement stations, pumping stations, tractor stations, and technology extension stations to help many scattered families, and some machines and technologies cannot be used on small plots of land at all; agricultural production cooperatives are larger in scale, and the land is connected, so it is naturally easier for the state to help everyone with new farm implements and new technologies.

    Cooperatives can Lead Farmers to Advance towards Socialism

    Everyone knows that socialism is good and wants to move to socialism sooner and live a happier life. However, large-scale agricultural production under complete socialism cannot be achieved all at once. It is a very, very big change to go from small-scale agriculture with single households to large-scale agriculture with hundreds or even one or two thousand households producing together. That requires everyone to have the habit of large-scale collective labor, the idea of wholeheartedly and unitedly striving for the collective cause, the ability to manage large-scale agriculture, and the funds to carry out large-scale production. Where do such habits, ideas, abilities, and funds come from? In agricultural production cooperatives, these things can be obtained more and more every day.

    Agricultural production cooperatives implement land shares and unified distribution of whatever is harvested, and the success or failure of the harvest on every piece of land in the entire cooperative is closely related to every member of the cooperative. In this way, everyone's collectivist thinking will naturally gradually improve. The cooperative implements a certain method of profit sharing according to labor, and the more actively they work, the more their income will increase. In this way, everyone's awareness of labor in collective production will naturally gradually increase. Everyone will increasingly understand the value of labor and understand that labor is the source of all happiness, and in the future, they will be able to implement a complete method of remuneration according to labor.

    Agricultural production cooperatives gradually expand, everyone's production capacity, cultural and technical level gradually improve, the cooperative's public property and agricultural infrastructure gradually increase, and everyone will naturally gradually have the ability to manage large-scale agriculture and gradually have the funds to carry out large-scale production.

    The unified management, partial remuneration according to labor, accumulation of public property, and improvement of the socialist and collectivist thinking of cooperative members in agricultural production cooperatives are all socialist factors, which are similar or identical to agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature. As these factors gradually increase, they can prepare conditions for future agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature, so that farmers will not feel sudden when they enter agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature in the future. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives can lead farmers step by step, naturally and smoothly, to complete socialism, and live a more fulfilling and happier life.

    农业生产合作社有些什么好处
    柯克明　杨　叶
    “单干户好比牛车，互助组好比汽车，农业生产合作社好比火车”，“单干不如互助，互助不如合作”，已经成了许多农民亲身体验到的和更广大的农民群众亲眼看到的事实。大家为什么说农业生产合作社好？顶重要的就是它能使农业产量提高，能使社员收入增加；还能使全体农民共同富裕起来，能带领农民一步一步向社会主义前进。
  合作社能进行比较大规模的
      生产
    大家拿本地的农业生产合作社和互助组、单干户比一下，拿社员们入社后和入社前比一下，就能比较出来：除了极少数办得太不好的社以外，大部分社的产量都增加了，而且能一年比一年提高一些。这是什么缘故呢？主要是因为农业生产合作社里实行了统一经营，集体劳动的组织也更合理了，公共财产也比互助组多了，有了进行比较大规模的生产的条件。
    土地交给社里统一使用，地力就能更充分地发挥出来了。一家一户分散经营的时候，不能不“吃啥种啥”，一小块土地要种好多种庄稼；如果土性适合种玉米，为了要吃小米、豆子，也得种些谷子、?豆；如果土性适合种棉花，为了要吃大米也得种稻子。这样，就把地力限制住了。统一使用土地以后，那块地的土性适合长什么庄稼就种什么庄稼，自然就能多收粮食、棉花；一大片、一大片都是一色庄稼，照管起来也比较省工。一家一户分散经营的时候，田埂、垅沟、地角、地头很多，占去不少地。统一使用土地以后，能够打破地界，耕地面积就扩大了。据河南省新乡专区的十三个社统计，打破地界以后，扩大了耕地面积四百四十四亩；按每亩产原粮二百斤计算，就可以多打八万八千多斤粮。一家一户分散经营的时候，地块太小，不好使用比较大的新式农具，也不好修比较大一些的水利，水田地区为了用水各家还常闹纠纷；统一使用土地以后，这些事情就都好办了。
    土地交给社里统一使用，就能更方便地改进技术了。一家一户分散经营的时候，一家土地很少，不敢大胆地进行改进技术的试验。土地统一经营了，分出一小部分地进行试验，即使失败了对大家的收入的影响也不大，大家的保守思想自然就容易打破了。一家一户分散经营的时候，不管什么肥料一股笼统都上到自己的小块土地上，很难按照土性的不同上不同的肥料。土地统一经营了，肥料也统一使用了，就可以看土性的不同上不同的肥料，这样肥料的作用就更大了。一家一户分散经营的时候，各家不一定都有好种籽，换起来容易杂，并且很麻烦，要误工，要吃亏。土地统一使用了，全社可以统一选种，把长得最好的能抗灾抗病的产量高的庄稼的种籽留下来，这和增产的关系也很大。像一九五三年山西省的农业生产合作社百分之九十以上都建立了试验改进技术的“小农场”和“留种地”，全部使用了优良品种；各社百分之九十以上的土地都实行了适当密植；施肥、灌溉等等技术也都有不少改进。这样，怎么会不增产呢？
    劳动力由社里统一使用，并且实行一定的按劳取酬，劳动效率就更容易提高了。一家一户分开干，顾这头顾不了那头，往往浪费很多力气和工夫；一个人很难是个“全把式”，总有一些农活自己做不好；家里有些半劳力或者身体衰弱、残废的人，做地里活也往往插不上手，只好闲着。统一使用劳力以后，有专人负责计划安排，按各个人的专长分工，就可以做到“八仙过海，各显其能”，把各种农活和副业活都做得更好；半劳力和衰弱残废的人也都能有喂牲口、带孩子等等轻活可以做，就可以腾出更多全劳力来为增加生产做更多的事情。因为实行一定的按劳取酬的办法，谁劳动的越多越好，收入就越多，并且越受大家尊敬，大家的劳动积极性也更高了。这样，各种活计就能做得更好更快了。据中共山西省委农村工作部的典型调查，农业生产合作社的劳动效率比互助组要高百分之十五左右。这样，就能有更多的力量进行土地加工和水利建设。像河南省新乡专区一百一十二个社，建社后就打了水井一百零五眼，增修水渠二十一条，保证了社内全部土地都能浇水，扩大了水田面积五千五百多亩。这样，也就有更多的力量和自然灾害作斗争。除了在兴修水利和改进技术方面从根本上征服灾害以外，即使遭到了自然灾害，社里人多力量大，全力出动，也能战胜或者减轻灾害。像河北省饶阳县耿长锁社，一九五三年连续战胜了旱、风、涝、虫四次灾害，全部土地每亩平均收了三百多斤粮食，比当地一般单干农民的平均产量高三分之一以上。这样，技术也更容易提高。因为社里分工细致，各专一业，熟能生巧；在一起商量的人也多了，人多智谋广，“三个臭皮匠，赛过诸葛亮”；干活的效率高了，大家也有在改进技术上用心思的工夫和兴趣了。
    社里有了相当数量的公共财产，就能办比较大的事情。像修比较大的水利、买成套的新式农具等等，在一家一户分开干的时候根本办不到，在互助组里也不容易办到；在社里就比较容易办了。
    土地统一经营，劳力统一使用，一定程度的按劳取酬，一定数量的公共财产，这些都是农业生产合作社里的社会主义因素。农业生产合作社能进行比较大规模的生产，能较多地增加生产，就是靠着这些社会主义因素；这些社会主义因素一年比一年增加，就能一年比一年增产更多。
  合作社能使全体农民共同富裕
    过去的经营地主，过去和现在的一些富农，他们也能经营比较大规模的农业生产。可是，照他们那样做，规模越大，就越会使更多的人受穷。这是因为，他们霸占着土地，他们自己不劳动或者很少劳动，全部或者主要是靠剥削过日子。没有土地的人，自然是要受他们剥削；就是有一些土地的农民，因为势单力薄，经不起天灾人祸的打击，生活一有困难，也就势必借高利贷、给人当雇工，受地主、高利贷主、富农剥削，甚至出卖全部土地。解放以后，经过土地改革，没收了地主的土地；农民不再受地主的剥削了，受富农剥削的也比较少了。可是，每户农民一小片土地，生产和生活就还是不能稳定，天灾和疾病死亡还会把许多农户弄得破产；富农、高利贷主和极少数条件比较优越的农民，就又乘机剥削遭到困难的农民。
    地主、富农的大规模农业，自然是不能使农民富裕的；因为那虽是大规模的，却是剥削人的。小农经济，也不能使农民共同富裕起来；因为它会生长出剥削人的事情来，而且是分散的、极小规模的，是有许多困难的，是抵挡不了灾害、不便于改进技术的。只有合作化的农业，既能使大家不受剥削，又能使生产不断增加，所以也就能使全体农民一同富裕。
    大家看看本地的实际情形，就能知道得更清楚了。凡是没有或者很少互助合作组织的地方，穷富分化的现象就比较多；发展了较多的互助合作组织、特别是发展了农业生产合作社的地方，就很少有穷富分化的情形，一般地说，参加了合作社的各家各户生活都是年年上升的。很不好解决的“困难户”问题，有了比较大的农业生产合作社，也就比较容易解决了。
  合作社便于和国家经济相结合
    在一家一户是一个经济单位的情况下，在生产方面和消费方面都是一家一个打算。种什么庄稼才合适，只能从自己家里的需要来看，不能从国家的需要来考虑。这样，就可能有的东西多种了，有的东西少种了，到末了对国家对自己都不利。自己家里需要什么东西，要用的时候也可能买不到。国家工厂不可能一家一户去问各家都需要什么东西，也就不好决定各种东西该造多少，可能有的东西造多了，有的东西造少了；到末了也是对国家对农民都不利。
    农业生产合作社把许多家联合起来了，和国家经济联系就比较方便了。国家通过供销合作社和农业生产合作社订合同。农业生产合作社需要什么东西，订在合同上，供销合作社就可以有计划地在一定的时间供给；国家需要什么粮食和工业原料，订在合同上，农业生产合作社就可以有计划地进行生产。这样，农民要用什么东西就容易买到，生产出来的东西也不至于卖不出去或者贱价卖出。这样，对国家对农民都有很大好处。
    农业生产合作社把许多家联合起来了，国家也更便于帮助农民。国家银行贷款给合作社，要比贷给许多家方便得多。国家的新式农具站、抽水机站、拖拉机站、技术推广站，帮助分散开来的许多家更不方便，有些机器和技术在小块地上根本没法用；农业生产合作社的规模比较大，土地联成了片，国家要用新农具、新技术帮助大家，自然就比较容易了。
  合作社能带领农民向社会
      主义前进
    大家都知道社会主义好，想快一些走到社会主义，过更幸福的日子。可是，完全社会主义的大规模的农业生产不是一下子就能办到的。从一家一户的小农业变成几百家以至一两千家在一起生产的大农业，是个很大很大的变化。那需要大家都有大规模的集体劳动的习惯，有全心全意同心合力为集体的事业奋斗的思想，有管理大规模的农业的本领，还要有进行大规模生产的资金。这样的习惯、思想、本领、资金从那里来呢？在农业生产合作社里，就可以一天比一天多地得到这些东西。
    农业生产合作社实行土地入股、收获什么东西都是统一分配，全社每一块土地上收成好坏和每个社员都有密切的关系了。这样，大家的集体主义思想自然就渐渐提高了。社里实行一定的按劳分红的办法，越积极劳动越能增加收入。这样，大家在集体生产中自觉的劳动的思想自然也就渐渐增长起来了。大家越来越懂得劳动的价值，懂得劳动是一切幸福生活的源泉，到将来就可以实行完全按劳取酬的办法了。
    农业生产合作社渐渐扩大，大家的生产能力、文化和技术水平渐渐提高，社里的公共财产和农业基本建设渐渐增多，大家自然也就渐渐有了经营大规模的农业的本领，也渐渐有了进行大规模的生产的资金。
    农业生产合作社的统一经营、部分的按劳取酬、公共财产的积累，社员的社会主义、集体主义思想的提高等等，都是社会主义的因素，是和完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社相似或相同的。这些因素渐渐地增加起来，就可以给将来的完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社准备好条件，这就使农民到将来进入完全的社会主义的农业生产合作社的时候，不会觉得突然。因此，农业生产合作社可以带领农民一步一步前进，自然地、顺当地走到完全的社会主义，过更美满更幸福的生活。
