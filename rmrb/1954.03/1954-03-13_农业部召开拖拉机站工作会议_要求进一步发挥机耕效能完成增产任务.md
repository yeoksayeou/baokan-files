    Ministry of Agriculture Convenes Tractor Station Work Conference
    Demands Further Utilization of Machine Tillage Effectiveness to Complete Production Increase Tasks
   [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government convened a work conference on agricultural machine tractor stations from February 15th to 27th. The conference summarized the work of the agricultural machine tractor stations that were the focus of pilot programs in 1953, and discussed and studied trial methods for constructing machine tractor stations, financial accounting work, production contracts, and many specific issues regarding further improving the work of machine tractor stations. Participants in the conference included station directors from eleven machine tractor stations in Northeast, East China, North China, and Central South, as well as representatives from state farm tilling teams, tractor work teams, and agricultural departments of the greater administrative regions and provinces.
    By the end of last year, eleven agricultural machine tractor stations had been established on a trial basis nationwide. Among the agricultural technology extension stations that mainly use new-style farm implements, there were thirty tractor work teams, and nine tractor tilling teams attached to state-run mechanized farms. The above fifty units are distributed in four greater administrative regions, ten provinces, and three cities across the country, and have all signed contracts with organized farmers to carry out mechanized operations such as plowing, harrowing, and partial sowing, harvesting, and threshing for their land. The work of each station and team fully demonstrates the enormous role of agricultural mechanization in increasing production and ensuring harvests, promoting the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and conducting ideological education for farmers. The Huachuan, Beijing, and Changzhi machine tractor stations began mechanized operations in the autumn of 1952. In 1953, the Huachuan Xinghuo Collective Farm's large-area rice cultivation yielded 860 jin per mu, 130 percent higher than the local yield; the Red Star Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, where two-thirds of the cultivated land was planted with cotton, produced an average of 162 jin of seed cotton per mu, 60 percent higher than the cotton fields outside the farm; and the Changzhi Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm's more than 12,000 mu of corn, millet, etc., yielded an average of 271 jin per mu, 47 percent higher than the local yield. The crops cultivated by the Bo'ai, Hailong, and other stations that began operations in the spring of 1953 also yielded more than 30 percent higher than the local yield. Due to the influence of the superiority of mechanized operations and after the propaganda and education of the general line, these farms have been further consolidated and expanded. At the same time, agricultural producers' cooperatives in the areas where these stations and teams are located have also developed rapidly. After forming cooperatives, farmers voluntarily requested that their land be connected into one piece in order to carry out machine cultivation.
    The conference considered that the tasks of the machine tractor stations are: to apply advanced agricultural science and technology, to ensure that the yield of crops and the income of the farms and cooperatives served are continuously increased; to continuously improve the efficiency of machinery and equipment, to give full play to the superiority of mechanization, to reduce costs, and to save state funds; to accumulate experience and train cadres, to lay a good foundation for large-scale development in the future; and to promote the consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and strengthen socialist education for farmers with the superiority of mechanization. The conference demanded that this year, each station should generally increase production by another 10 percent on the basis of last year's increase, and in areas with the conditions, increase it by 20 to 30 percent. The conference also pointed out that in order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary to improve the quality of machine cultivation operations and improve agricultural production technology. In specific implementation, each station and team must closely integrate with the masses of the farms and cooperatives they serve, and jointly strive to achieve this requirement.

    农业部召开拖拉机站工作会议
    要求进一步发挥机耕效能完成增产任务
   【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部在二月十五日到二十七日召开了农业机器拖拉机站工作会议，对一九五三年重点试办的农业机器拖拉机站工作进行了总结，并讨论和研究了建设机器拖拉机站的试行办法、财务会计工作、生产合同和进一步提高机器拖拉机站工作的许多具体问题。参加这次会议的有东北、华东、华北、中南等地十一个机器拖拉机站的站长和国营农场代耕队、拖拉机工作队和大区、省农业部门的代表等。
    到去年年底为止，全国已试办十一个农业机器拖拉机站，在以使用新式农具为主的农业技术推广站中设有拖拉机工作队三十个，附设在国营机械化农场的拖拉机代耕队有九个。以上五十个单位分布在全国四个大区、十个省、三个市的地区内，都和组织起来的农民订立合同，为他们的土地进行耕、耙和部分播种、收获、脱粒等机械作业。从各站、队的工作中充分显示出农业机械化对增产保收、促进农业生产合作社的巩固与发展和对农民进行思想教育的巨大作用。桦川、北京、长治三个机器拖拉机站在一九五二年秋季就开始了机械作业，一九五三年桦川星火集体农庄大面积种植的水稻每亩产稻八百六十斤，高出当地产量百分之一百三十；京郊红星集体农庄三分之二耕地上种植的棉花，平均每亩产籽棉一百六十二斤，高出庄外棉田百分之六十；长治中苏友好集体农庄的一万二千多亩玉米、谷子等，平均每亩产量二百七十一斤，比当地产量高出百分之四十七。一九五三年春季开始作业的博爱、海龙等站所耕种的农作物也都比当地产量高出百分之三十以上。由于机械化作业优越性的影响和经过总路线的宣传教育，这些农庄已进一步巩固和扩大。同时，这些站和队所在地区的农业生产合作社发展也较快，农民们在组成合作社以后，都自愿要求把土地连成一片，以便进行机器耕作。
    会议认为机器拖拉机站的任务是：引用先进农业科学技术，保证所服务的庄、社农作物产量不断提高，收入不断增加；不断提高机具效能，发挥机械化的优越性，降低成本，节约国家资金；积累经验，培养干部，为今后大量发展打下良好基础；以机械化的优越性，促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，加强对农民的社会主义教育。会议要求今年各站在去年增产基础上一般再提高产量百分之十，有条件的地方提高百分之二十到三十。会议并指出：为了达到这一要求，必须提高机耕作业的质量和改进农业生产技术。在具体进行中，各站、队必须和所服务的庄、社群众密切结合，共同争取实现这一要求。
