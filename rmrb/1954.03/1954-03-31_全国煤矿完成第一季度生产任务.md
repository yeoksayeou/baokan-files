National coal mines complete first quarter production tasks

[By our Staff Reporter] National state-owned coal mines overfulfilled the first quarter production target five days ahead of schedule on March 26th, with a cumulative output increase of over 27% compared to the same period last year. Calculated by major administrative regions, the region with the highest overfulfillment of the national first quarter plan by March 27th reached 5.11%. Several units that did not perform well in completing production tasks last year have also done very well this year. This is an unprecedentedly good phenomenon in the history of national coal mines.

This year, the safety production situation of national coal mines has greatly improved compared to the same period last year, with the number of deaths decreasing by 18.8% and serious injuries also reduced. The Central South and Northwest regions eliminated fatal accidents, and the East China and Southwest regions reduced the number of deaths by 85.5% compared to the same period last year. The safety situation in March showed even more significant improvement, with fewer casualties than in January and February.

One of the characteristics that distinguish this year's first quarter coal mine production from the past is that each mine has overfulfilled its monthly production plan (Jingxing Mine only completed 99.8% of its February production plan); another characteristic is the achievement of balanced production, with the difference between the highest and lowest average daily output of mines nationwide only 2.74%. At present, tunneling work is still a relatively weak link. Although the completion of tunneling plans in various mines is much better than in the same period last year, such as the advanced experience of "relay slotting" at the Datong Mining Bureau in the first quarter of this year, with tunneling efficiency even higher than that of the Ma Liu Hai group, the national coal mine tunneling has not yet met the national requirements, especially the major roadway tunneling plans have been completed even worse.

The formal operation of large-scale sites in the thin coal seams of the Ping'an No. 1 Mine in Fuxin, which was decided to be piloted this year, went through nine cycles from March 4th to 12th, and officially entered the key pilot stage on the 13th, and has achieved great results. It has solved many ideological and technical problems that were previously considered difficult and impossible to put into practice, and confirmed the correctness of the technical operation regulations. This is a new victory in coal mine production. In terms of tunneling, many units have further paid attention to production geological surveying. The National Coal Mine Cadre Conference held in February decided to establish production geological surveying institutions in various mines to fundamentally solve the backwardness in tunneling.

The production task of national state-owned coal mines in the first quarter of this year only accounts for 23% of the annual output task. Therefore, the production task for the second quarter will be higher than that of the first quarter, and will not be lower than 25% of the annual task; at the same time, various preparations must be made in the second quarter for the third and fourth quarters, so the production task for the second quarter is even more arduous. Recently, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau have made thorough arrangements and are mobilizing coal mine workers across the country to take a big step forward on the basis of successfully completing the first quarter production plan, and ensure the safe, balanced, and overfulfilled completion of the more arduous production task for the second quarter. The National Coal Mine Trade Union will also organize representatives from various mines to visit the "parallel fissure method" advanced experience in tunneling work at the Jingxi Coal Mine in the second quarter, striving to change the backward state of tunneling.

### 全国煤矿完成第一季度生产任务

    全国煤矿完成第一季度生产任务
   【本报讯】全国国营煤矿在三月二十六日提前五天超额完成第一季度产量任务，累计产量比去年同期增加了百分之二十七以上。以大行政区为单位计算，到三月二十七日，产量超过国家第一季度计划最多的达百分之五点一一。去年生产任务完成不够好的几个单位，今年也都完成得很好。这是全国煤矿历年来所没有的好现象。
    今年全国煤矿安全生产情况与去年同期比较有很大改进，死亡人数降低了百分之十八点八，重伤也减少了。中南、西北两区消灭了死亡事故，华东、西南两区死亡人数比去年同期降低了百分之八十五点五。三月份安全情况更有显著好转，伤亡事故比一、二月份更少。
    今年第一季度煤矿生产和过去不同的特点之一，是各矿都按月超额完成了生产计划（井陉矿二月份的生产计划只完成百分之九十九点八）；另一个特点是达到了均衡生产，全国各矿每月平均日产量，最高与最低比较只相差百分之二点七四。现在只有掘进工作还是一个比较薄弱的环节，各矿掘进计划完成的情况虽比去年同期好得多，如大同矿务局在今年第一季度出现了“接力掏槽”的先进经验，掘进效率比马六孩小组的还高，但全国煤矿掘进还没有达到国家要求，尤其是主要巷道的掘进计划完成得更差。
    今年决定在阜新平安一坑薄煤层中试行的大场子正规作业，由三月四日到十二日走了九个循环，到十三日已正式进入重点试办阶段，现已取得很大成绩。解决了过去认为困难很多、不可能走上循环的思想和技术方面的许多问题，证实了技术作业规程的正确性，这是煤矿生产上一个新的胜利。在掘进方面，很多单位已进一步注意到生产地质测量工作，今年二月召开的全国煤矿干部会议，决定在各矿建立生产地质测量机构，从根本上解决掘进落后的局面。
    今年第一季度全国国营煤矿的生产任务，仅为全年产量任务的百分之二十三，因此第二季度的生产任务要比第一季度任务高，至少不会低于全年任务的百分之二十五；同时还要在第二季度为第三、四季度作好各项准备工作，所以，第二季度生产任务更加繁重。最近，中央燃料工业部与煤矿管理总局已作了周密的布置，正动员全国煤矿职工在胜利完成第一季度生产计划的基础上，再大大前进一步，保证安全地、均衡地超额完成第二季度更加艰巨的生产任务。全国煤矿工会也将在第二季度组织各矿代表，到京西煤矿参观掘进工作中的“平行龟裂法”先进经验，争取改变掘进方面的落后状态。
