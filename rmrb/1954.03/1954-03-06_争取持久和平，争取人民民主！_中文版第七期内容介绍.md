Introduction to the Seventh Issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" (Chinese Edition)

The seventh issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "The Booming Cultural Upsurge in People's Democratic Countries." The editorial points out that within a relatively short period, the working people of the People's Democratic countries have made great achievements in completing the tasks of cultural revolution (a necessary component of socialist construction). These countries are carrying out a struggle on an increasingly broad scale to oppose the harmful influence of the old ideological system and to create a new culture with national form and socialist content. The People's Democratic countries are providing meticulous care for national education. Compulsory primary education has been implemented in these countries. Illiteracy is being rapidly eliminated. The rise of a new intelligentsia, with the children of workers and peasants as its main body, is one of the most significant achievements of this cultural revolution. The excellent elements of the old intelligentsia are also actively participating in socialist construction. The new literature and art are advancing and developing in the struggle against formalism and against the blind worship of bourgeois art. The editorial emphasizes that the victorious completion of the tasks of cultural revolution in the People's Democratic countries is inseparable from the growing cultural exchange and continuous cultural cooperation among the countries of the socialist democratic camp. The current task of the Communist and Workers' Parties in these countries is to further raise the cultural level of the people, to educate the people to become conscious builders of socialist society, to redouble their efforts in cultural construction, and to oppose bourgeois ideology and the "ideas" that promote destruction and war.

This issue contains the following articles: "Economic Cooperation Among the Countries of the Democratic Camp" by Richard Dvořák, Minister of Foreign Trade of the Czechoslovak Republic; "Regularly Checking Implementation is the Guarantee of Victorious Fulfillment of Party Resolutions" by S. Dirbakov, Secretary of the Pleven Regional Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and "'Unità' Celebrates its Thirtieth Anniversary" by O. Pastore, First Editor of "Unità," the central organ of the Italian Communist Party.

Dvořák's article points out that foreign trade is an important form of economic cooperation among the countries of the democratic camp, and the plans of these countries for developing their national economies are coordinated with each other through foreign trade. The one-year trade agreements mutually concluded between the countries of the democratic camp have gradually developed into a system of long-term agreements. In the victorious industrialization process of the People's Democratic countries, we can clearly see the fundamental difference in principle between the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the countries of the democratic camp and the so-called "economic cooperation" in the capitalist world. The economies of the People's Democratic countries have a solid foundation. They can completely obtain the machinery, raw materials, and grain they need from friendly countries, and they also have the strong economic power of the Soviet Union as their main pillar. In the process of industrialization, especially in recent years, these countries have also extensively exchanged technical information. In this regard, the Soviet Union has given valuable assistance to all People's Democratic countries. The article concludes by emphasizing that although the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has achieved great success, they are still willing to expand trade with all countries that are willing to trade on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit.

Dirbakov's article summarizes the situation of the Pleven Region party organization in Bulgaria in regularly checking the implementation of resolutions. The article points out that inspection will be effective if the party takes an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings when inspecting the implementation of resolutions. Experience has shown that if we strengthen the personal responsibility of leaders, regularly supervise and inspect their work, and give them direct and good assistance, backward organizations can become advanced organizations. At the same time, checking the implementation of resolutions is also an inspection of cadres, an inspection of their talents and their organizational ability in completing current tasks. In order for inspection work to achieve its due effect, it is also necessary to combine top-down inspection with bottom-up inspection. Regular and comprehensive inspection of implementation is the key to ensuring the accurate completion of the resolutions of the Party and the government.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第七期已经出版。
    本期以“人民民主国家澎湃的文化高潮”为题发表社论。社论指出：在一个比较短的时期内，人民民主国家的劳动人民在完成文化革命（社会主义建设的必要构成部分）的任务方面已取得了很大的成就。这些国家正以日益广阔的规模开展斗争，来反对旧思想体系的有害影响，来创造民族形式、社会主义内容的新文化。人民民主国家无微不至地关怀着国民教育。初等义务教育制已在这些国家实行。文盲正在被迅速地扫除中。以工农的子弟为主体的人民的新知识分子的兴起，是这种文化革命最重大的成果之一。旧知识分子中的优秀部分也在积极参加社会主义建设。新文学和艺术正在反对形式主义、反对盲目崇拜资产阶级艺术的斗争中前进和发展。社论着重说：人民民主国家文化革命任务的胜利完成，是和社会主义民主阵营各国间日益增长的文化交流和不断发展着的文化合作分不开的。这些国家的共产党和工人党的当前任务，就是进一步提高人民的文化水平，教育人民成为社会主义社会的自觉的建设者，加倍努力从事文化建设，反对资产阶级思想，反对鼓吹毁灭和战争的“思想”。
    本期刊载的文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共和国对外贸易部部长理查德·德沃夏克的“民主阵营各国的经济合作”，保加利亚共产党普勒文州委员会书记萨·迪尔鲍科夫的“经常检查执行情况是胜利实现党的决议的保证”，意大利共产党中央机关报“团结报”第一编辑奥·帕斯托雷的“‘团结报’创刊三十周年”。
    德沃夏克的文章指出：对外贸易是民主阵营各国间经济合作的一种重要形式，这些国家发展国民经济的计划是通过对外贸易而相互配合的。民主阵营各国之间相互订立的为期一年的贸易协定，已逐渐发展成为长期性的协定制度。在人民民主国家的胜利的工业化的过程中，我们清楚地看到了苏联和民主阵营各国之间的经济合作与资本主义世界中的所谓“经济合作”的原则差别。人民民主国家的经济有着巩固基础。它们完全可以从友好国家得到自己所需要的机器、原料和粮食，而且还有苏联强大的经济力量做它们的主要支柱。这些国家在工业化的过程中，特别是最近几年来，还大量地交换了技术资料。在这方面，苏联给了一切人民民主国家宝贵的帮助。文章最后强调说：虽然苏联和人民民主国家之间的经济合作已取得了巨大的成就，但是，它们都还愿意和一切愿在完全平等互利的基础上进行贸易的国家扩大贸易。
    迪尔鲍科夫的文章综述了保加利亚普勒文州党组织经常检查决议执行情况的情形。文章指出：党在检查决议执行情况的时候，如果对缺点采取不调和的态度，那末检查就会收到效果。经验证明，如果加强领导人的个人负责制，经常监督和检查他们的工作，给他们以直接和良好的帮助，落后的组织就可以成为先进的组织。同时，检查决议执行情况也是检查干部、检查他们的才干和他们完成当前任务时的组织能力。为了使检查工作发挥应有的效果，还必须把自上而下的检查和自下而上的检查结合起来。经常而全面地检查执行情况，是保证准确完成党和政府的决议的关键。　（新华社）
