Hebei Province's state-owned farms are actively preparing for spring plowing to fulfill this year's production plans and ensure increased grain and cotton production. According to the dry soil conditions in the local area, Yongnian Farm has already irrigated 1,270 mu of land. Baoding Mechanized Farm is also organizing irrigation equipment and has rolled over 500 mu of land based on the soil moisture. Jiheng Mechanized Farm is both harrowing the land to conserve moisture and surveying water conservancy projects. To increase production and reduce costs, the farms are also carrying out a movement to accumulate coarse manure. Baoding Mechanized Farm did not pay much attention to accumulating coarse manure in the past, accumulating only 1,700 cartloads throughout last year, but this year it has already accumulated more than 4,000 cartloads. According to statistics from 19 farms, more than 9,700 cartloads of coarse manure were accumulated in January alone. While carrying out tasks such as land preparation, moisture conservation, and fertilizer accumulation, the farms in various regions have also inspected and repaired various farm tools.

In order to leverage the role of state-owned farms in transforming the small-scale peasant economy, the farms in various regions are not only striving to do well in their own production, but also actively encouraging the broad masses of peasants, especially those organized, to strive for increased production in order to consolidate mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Baoding, Dingxian, and Shijiazhuang Special District Farms, as well as Shulu County Farm and Baoding Mechanized Farm, plan to focus on helping 12 agricultural production cooperatives and three mutual aid teams improve their farming techniques and achieve the goal of increasing production. Shulu County Farm also plans to help farmers in two villages improve their farming techniques. Baoding Mechanized Farm plans to use machines to cultivate 400 to 500 mu of land for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and has formulated specific plans to provide technical assistance to the cooperatives and teams. Baoding Special District and Tongxian Special District Farms have convened training courses for technicians from county farms and technical extension stations in order to improve their technical level, manage their own production well, and provide specific guidance to the broad masses of peasants in improving production techniques.

    河北省各地国营农场积极准备春耕
   【本报讯】河北省各地国营农场为了完成今年的生产计划，保证粮棉增产，正积极进行春耕生产准备。永年农场根据当地土壤干燥的情况，已浇了一千二百七十亩地。保定机耕农场也正整理浇水设备，并根据墒土情况已轧地五百多亩。冀衡机耕农场正一面进行耙地保墒，一面进行水利工程的勘测工作。各农场为了增加生产，降低成本，还开展了积粗肥的运动。保定机耕农场过去不大注意积粗肥，去年全年才积一千七百来车，今年积的粗肥已达四千多车。据十九个农场的统计，一月份就积粗肥九千七百多车。各地农场在进行整地保墒积肥等工作的同时，对各种农具进行了检查和修理。
    为了发挥国营农场在改造小农经济中的作用，各地农场除努力作好场内生产以外，并积极带动广大农民特别是组织起来的农民争取增产，以巩固互助合作组织。保定、定县、石家庄专区农场和束鹿县农场、保定机耕农场，计划重点帮助十二个农业生产合作社、三个互助组提高耕作技术，实现增产的目的。束鹿县农场还计划帮助两个村的农民改进耕作技术。保定机耕农场计划用机器给农业生产合作社和互助组代耕四百到五百亩地，并订出了在技术上帮助社、组的具体计划。保定专区和通县专区农场召开了各县农场和技术推广站的技术人员训练班，以便提高技术水平，把本场生产搞好，并具体指导广大农民改进生产技术。
