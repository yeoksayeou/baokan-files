    People's Fighters Guarding the Border and Coastal Defense Lines
    On the Pamir Plateau
    In March, spring has already arrived in the south of our motherland, but the Pamir Plateau is still a world of ice and snow. Here, one sees towering peaks and barren Gobi deserts. The weather here is changeable, with frequent gales and rainstorms, and torrents of sand and rock swept up by the wind and mountain floods rushing down. However, right here, on the western border of our motherland, regardless of storms or blizzards, regardless of day or night, there are always people active - these are the People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding the sacred border of our motherland. One snowy day, Liu Zhijian, a communist party member of a certain unit, was on duty at the border. In the storm, he stood in his sentry post, covered in snow, like a snowman, his feet sunk in the knee-deep snow. Although he was wearing a fur coat, a fur hat, and felt boots, he was still shivering with cold. He thought of hiding from the storm in the bunker to warm up, but then he thought of himself guarding the border, with the great rivers and mountains of the motherland behind him. A sacred sense of responsibility kept him standing there, his eyes fixed on the front, until dawn. Another snowy night, Youth League member Wei Shengjie was on sentry duty. The platoon leader came to check on him and asked, "Who's up there?" The answer was, "Soldier Wei Shengjie!" "The wind is too strong and it's snowing, aren't you cold?" The platoon leader was already close to him. "Report to the commander, we are loyal to the motherland, stick to our posts, and are not afraid of hardship!" The platoon leader smiled with satisfaction.
    On another night, the border patrol was about to begin, and the border guards were ready to go. The sentry on the bunker suddenly sounded the alarm, discovering a dark shadow moving towards our side from the south. The border guards quickly mounted their horses and divided into two groups to outflank the shadow. The rifle group bypassed the enemy from behind, climbed a 400-meter-high snow mountain in thirty minutes, and quickly cut off the enemy's retreat. The enemy tried to resist using the terrain, but our soldiers' shiny bayonets were already aimed at his chest. This spy, who tried to sneak into our border, was finally arrested. (Zhao Ciming)

	The Harvest of Maotou Ocean
    After the first month of the lunar year, the southeast wind prevails at sea, and the seawater gets warmer day by day. The season for the large yellow croaker is here. This is the harvest season of Maotou Ocean.
    But this is not a peaceful production environment. On the eastern edge of the Maotou Ocean fishing grounds, there are still several islands occupied by the remnants of the American-Chiang bandit gang. The enemy is working hard to undermine the happy life of our people.
    The People's Navy and local cadres have repeatedly studied the fishing ground conditions and made careful arrangements for protecting the fishing operations. Powerful艇teams patrol the fishing grounds day and night. At the same time, it was decided that in the tense days before production, wherever the fishing boats go to fish, the navy will protect them, to ensure that fishermen do not suffer any losses under any circumstances.
    The enemy was indeed not reconciled. Before the main force of the large yellow croaker had arrived, an enemy 600-ton gunboat had already sneaked into the fishing grounds. In a fierce naval battle half a month ago, this enemy ship was hit and set on fire by our艇teams. The soldiers were very happy to see it coming again, and prepared to give it another devastating blow this time. Who knew that it did not dare to fight again. As soon as our艇teams launched an attack, it quickly opened up its horsepower and slipped away.
    The large yellow croaker season has finally arrived. The passage of hundreds of millions of large yellow croaker caused serious disturbances throughout the ocean. Sometimes the fish swarm close to the surface, and the seawater shows a yellow color. Large yellow croaker chase each other, crowding each other, constantly jumping out of the water, like yellow flowers blooming on the sea. At least one or two thousand catties can be caught in a net, and sometimes even five or six thousand catties.
    At night, fishing boats loaded with fresh fish gathered at the ice-fresh boats that purchased fresh fish in Zhumen Port. Soon, more than one hundred ice-fresh boats were filled, and fishing boats continued to pour in. If they were shaken to Shipu to sell to processing plants, it would take at least ten hours. Not only could the fish rot, but it would also delay the fishing season. The fishermen who had not unloaded the ships were very anxious. At this time, the People's Navy extended a helping hand and sent many gunboats to help the fishermen tow the boats. Each gunboat towed more than a dozen fishing boats, and they sailed to Shipu in a mighty manner. In less than three hours, these boats had already unloaded their goods at Shipu Wharf.
    In just four days of formal fishing, more than 22.2 million catties of large yellow croaker have been caught. If calculated at the lowest price of 65,000 yuan per hundred catties, it would add more than 140 billion yuan of wealth to the country. How abundant our great motherland is!
    The People's Navy has been protecting fishing operations since 1950. In the past few years, the fishermen's output has increased year by year, and their lives have improved year by year. A naval soldier went to the People's Bank to save money and saw many fishermen queuing up to remit money to their hometowns. He returned to the艇and said excitedly, "Seeing the fisherman brothers remitting one million and two million to their hometowns, I feel really happy." (Guan Shinan)

    Destroy the Enemy at Sea
    This was the beginning of an ordinary working day. The seamless steel tube factory of Anshan Iron and Steel is carrying out the final installation work. The fiery iron water of No. 8 blast furnace is pouring out. The workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are walking onto the construction site. The tractors of the Xinghuo Collective Farm have loosened the land. The mother is waking up the sleepy primary school students. The early fishing boats have already gone out to sea. This is six o'clock in the morning, the beginning of an ordinary, tense, and happy working day in the motherland. The No. 17 and No. 360 gunboats of the Northeast Public Security Forces' Marine Patrol Team also began patrolling the sea. On this side of the sea is the motherland's heavy industry base - tall chimneys and rapidly rotating machines. On the other side of the sea - in the southeast - is the place occupied by the wicked American and Li bandit gangs. The gunboats fearlessly sailed 30 miles out to sea and discovered a fishing boat waving a flag. "There's a situation," Squad Leader Zhang Cai immediately ordered, "Go over there." Sure enough, the fishermen reported that an enemy艇 had snatched a fishing boat with three fishermen and fled in a hurry.
    After Zhang Cai reported the situation to the command post, he immediately announced: "Prepare for battle, chase after them!" "Chase after them," Captain Wang Chengde tightened the rudder, his eyes fixed on the sea. Heavy machine gunner Xu Chongqi pressed his hands on the machine gun. Closer, closer, the distance from the enemy ship was only a few hundred meters. No. 17艇rushed forward, "Da, da, da..." Two machine guns opened fire at the enemy ship. The firepower on the enemy ship also concentrated on No. 17艇. Suddenly, after a shot, a flashing signal flare was suspended in the high air. No. 17艇ordered No. 360 to fire. Gunner Zhao Yongkui had been waiting for this signal for a long time. He muttered to himself, "This time, you should taste the good snacks produced by the factories of New China." After a few booms, the enemy ship's pilothouse was pierced, and the hull lost its balance, swaying from side to side. Our boat took advantage of the situation to concentrate its firepower and fire fiercely at it. After a few shells were fired, the enemy ship's engine room was hit, followed by the sound of gasoline barrels exploding and the explosions of various bullets and shells, and the enemy ship turned into a sea of ​​fire in an instant. The bandits jumped into the sea to escape, and finally one by one were captured alive by our coastal defense soldiers.
    The rescued fishermen were so grateful that they could not speak. They just held the soldiers' hands tightly, looking at the soldiers from head to toe, and then looking at the boundless ocean and their hometown behind them. (Chen Dehu)

    Sprinkling "Golden Queen" on the Border
    The early autumn sun shone on the Yunnan border, shining on this green dam filled with rice and corn - Tonghai Dam. Stationed here are the soldiers of the Zhang Yingcai Steel Battalion, a national combat hero. They eat the grain produced here, drink the water here, guard these mountains and dams, and have fallen in love with this land.
    This Tonghai Dam, which is less than 30 miles in circumference, has a small cornfield that is most noticeable. The corn cobs are as thick as arms, a foot long, leaves as wide as palms, and stalks more than eight feet tall. The tall soldiers drill into the corn forest, and even their heads cannot be seen. This corn seed is called "Golden Queen," and it was sent from the home of Wu Renhai, the model affairs officer of the third company of the Zhang Yingcai Steel Battalion - from Shanxi.
    In early March last year, Wu Renhai led his livestock down the mountain from the logging area of the battalion to buy vegetables, and first went to this village to find Street Chief Li Qilian. Street Chief Li was holding a meeting with the production mutual aid group leader and militiamen to discuss production issues. When talking about corn, Wu Renhai could not help but interject, "Our northern 'Golden Queen' corn seeds are very good. Plant it, fertilize it diligently, and water it more. One mu can produce more than 600 catties, and the single cob is much bigger than the corn cobs here." After this talk, the folks all spoke up: "Comrade Wu, can you ask your family to send some?" "Yes," Wu Renhai readily agreed. And immediately wrote a fast letter to his brother. Soon his brother sent a kilogram of "Golden Queen" corn seeds.
    The "Golden Queen" grew soon after it was sown, growing so lush. As soon as Street Chief Li walked to the dam, he couldn't help but stare at this cornfield, and he couldn't help but think: "The army helped us eliminate the thieves, allowing us to live a stable life that we have never had before. Now they are like our own brothers, caring about our production, really! ..."
    This matter quickly spread in the border area, and the folks planned to sprinkle more "Golden Queen" seeds on the fertile land of the border. (Zhou Sen)

    守卫在边疆和海防线上的人民战士
    在帕米尔高原上
    三月天气，在祖国的江南已经春暖花开，而在帕米尔高原，还是一片坚冰积雪。这里看到的不是耸入云霄的高峰，就是终年草木不生的戈壁滩。这里天气多变，时而狂风大作，时而雨雪交加，狂风卷起沙石，山洪疾泻而下。但是，就在这里，在祖国西陲的国境线上，不管狂风暴雨，不管冰天雪地，也不分白天黑夜，都有人活动着，这就是守卫着祖国神圣边疆的人民解放军战士。一个风雪飞卷的日子，某部战士共产党员刘志俭在国境线上值勤，狂风大雪中他站立在哨位上，身上落满了雪，就像一个雪人，双脚蹬在盖膝的雪里，虽然穿着皮袄，戴着皮帽，蹬着毡靴，浑身还冷得发抖。他也曾想到碉堡里躲一躲风雪，暖一暖身子，但一转念想到自己是守卫在国境线上，后面是祖国的大好河山时，一种神圣的责任感，使他站在那里，眼睛盯着前方，一直坚持到天亮。又一个风雪交加的深夜，青年团员魏胜杰站在哨位上了。排长来查哨问道： “谁在上边？”回答是：“战士魏胜杰！”“风太大，又下雪，不怕冷吗？”排长已走近他的身边。“报告指挥员同志，我们忠于祖国，坚守岗位，不怕艰苦！”排长满意地笑了。
    在另一个夜里，巡查国界就要开始了，边防战士整装待发。碉堡上的哨兵突然发出警报，发现正南方有一个黑影向我方移动。边防战士迅速跨上战马，分两路包抄那个黑影。步枪组绕过敌人后面，三十分钟爬上四百公尺高的雪山，迅速截断了敌人的后路。敌人还想利用地形顽抗，我们战士明晃晃的刺刀已经对准了他的胸膛。这一个企图混进我们国境线的间谍终于被捕了。　（赵慈命）猫头洋的丰收
    正月过后，海上东南风当令，海水一天比一天温暖。大黄鱼汛到了。这是猫头洋丰收的季节。
    但这里并不是和平的生产环境。就在猫头洋渔场的东缘，还有几座被美蒋残余匪帮盘据的岛屿。敌人处心积虑要破坏我们人民的幸福生活。
    人民海军和地方干部反复研究渔场情况，进行了周密的护渔部署，强大的艇队不分昼夜在渔场巡逻，同时决定在生产前紧张的几天，渔船捕到那里，海军护到那里，要做到在任何情况下不使渔民受到一点损失。
    敌人果然没有死心，大黄鱼群的主干还没有来到，敌六百吨炮舰一艘已经窜入渔场来了。早在半个月前一次激烈的海战中，这艘敌舰曾被我艇队击中起火，战士们看见它又来了都非常高兴，准备这次再给它一个歼灭性的打击。谁知它已不敢再战，我艇队刚一出击，它赶快开足马力溜了。
    大黄鱼汛终于来了。亿万条大黄鱼的通过，使整个洋面引起严重的骚动。有时鱼群贴近水面，海水呈现一片黄色。大黄鱼互相追逐着，拥挤着，不时地跃出水面，像是大海上开出一朵朵的黄花。一网下去至少能捞一、两千斤，有时竟捞到五、六千斤。
    入夜，满载鲜鱼的渔船，向珠门港收购鲜鱼的冰鲜船集中，很快一百多只冰鲜船都已装满，渔船还不断涌来，如果摇到石浦去卖给加工厂，至少需要十几小时，不但鱼可能烂掉，还会误了渔期。没有卸船的渔民非常焦急。这时，人民海军伸出了援助的手，开来了很多炮艇帮助渔民拖船，每一只炮艇拖了十几只渔船，浩浩荡荡驶往石浦。不到三小时，这些船已经在石浦码头卸货了。
    正式捕鱼不过四天，已捕了大黄鱼二千二百余万斤，如以最低价格每百斤六万五千元计算，就为国家增加了一百四十多亿元的财富。我们伟大的祖国多么丰饶啊！
    人民海军从一九五○年开始护渔，几年来渔民捕鱼的产量一年比一年增加，生活也一年比一年改善。一位海军战士到人民银行去储蓄，看见许多渔民排着队往家乡汇钱。他回到艇上兴奋地说：“看见渔民兄弟一百万、两百万地往家乡汇钱，心里真痛快。”　（关世楠）
    把敌人消灭在海洋上
    这是一个平常的劳动日的开始。鞍钢的无缝钢管厂正在紧张地进行着最后的安装工程，八号高炉火红的铁水已在倾泻出来，第一座汽车制造厂的工人正走上建筑工地，星火集体农庄的拖拉机已经翻松了土地，母亲正叫醒了贪睡的小学生，早航的渔船已经出海了。这时是早晨六点钟，祖国的一个平常的紧张而幸福的劳动日的开始，东北公安部队海防巡逻队十七号和三六○号炮艇也开始出海巡逻。海的这面是祖国的重工业基地——高大的烟囱和飞速旋转的机器，海的那面——东南方是万恶的美李匪帮盘踞的地方，炮艇无畏地驶出海面三十英里，发现一条渔船在摇摆着旗子。“有情况”，小队长张财马上命令“开过去”。果然，渔民报告，有敌艇一艘抢去渔船一只，渔民三名，仓皇逃走了。
    张财向指挥所报告情况以后，随即宣布：“做好战斗准备，追上去！”“追上去”，船长王成德把紧了舵，两眼紧盯着海面；重机枪手徐崇琪双手按在枪机上。近了，近了，距离敌船只有几百公尺远了，十七号船猛冲过去，“哒、哒、哒……”两挺机枪对准敌船开火。敌船上的火力也集中向十七号还击。突然，一声枪响之后，高空中悬起闪色的信号弹，十七号命令三六○号开炮了。炮手赵永奎早就在等待着这个信号，他自言自语地说：“这回该给你们尝尝新中国工厂出产的好点心了。”轰轰几炮打过去了，敌船的舵楼被打穿了，船身失去了平衡，东摇西晃起来。我船乘势集中火力向它猛力射击，几发炮弹发出之后，敌船的机舱被打中，接着汽油筒的爆炸声和各种子弹、炮弹的爆炸声响成一片，霎时敌船变成一片大火。匪徒纷纷跳海逃命，终于
  一个个被我海防战士活捉了。
    被救的渔民感激得说不出话来，他们只是紧紧握住战士们的双手不放，从战士的头上看到脚下，然后又瞭望着那无边际的海洋和他们背后的家乡。（陈德湖）
    把“金皇后”撒在边疆
    初秋的太阳照耀着云南边疆，照耀着这块长满稻谷、玉米的翠绿色的坝子——通海坝。驻守在这里的是全国战斗英雄张英才钢铁营的战士。他们吃着这里出产的粮食，喝着这里的水，守卫着这些山坝，爱上了这块土地。
    这块方圆不到三十里地的通海坝，有一小块最惹人注意的玉米地。玉米穗有胳膊粗，一尺来长，手掌宽的叶子，八尺多高的秆子。大个子战士钻进玉米林里，连头都露不出来。这玉米种子叫“金皇后”，是张英才钢铁营三连模范事务长武仁孩家里——山西寄来的。
    去年三月初，武仁孩牵着牲口从营里伐木区下山来买菜，首先就到这寨子来找李起连街长。李街长正和生产互助组长、民兵们开会讨论生产问题。谈到玉米时，武仁孩禁不住插嘴说：“咱北方的‘金皇后’玉米种可好咧，种上它，勤上粪，多浇水，一亩地就能打六百多斤，单棒子骨头就比这里的玉米穗大的多。”这一讲，老乡们都说话了：“武同志能不能叫你家里寄点来呀？”“行，”武仁孩满口应承下来。并且马上就给他哥哥写了封快信。不久他哥哥就寄来了一公斤“金皇后”玉米种。
    “金皇后”播下去不久就长起来了，长得是那样茂盛，李街长一走到坝上，就不由得看着这块玉米地出神，也就不由得想：“大军帮我们消灭了蟊贼，使我们过着从来没有的安稳日子，如今又像自家兄弟一样，关心我们的生产，真是！……”
    这件事，在边疆很快传开了，老乡们打算把更多的“金皇后”种子撒在边疆肥沃的土地上。（周森）
