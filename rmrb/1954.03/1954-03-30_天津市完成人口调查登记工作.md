    Tianjin Completes Population Survey and Registration Work
    The population survey and registration work in all districts of Tianjin and Tanggu District has been completed. The survey results show that the population of Tianjin has significantly increased in the five years since liberation. According to the population age ratio table, the largest proportion is infants aged under one to four years old. Since liberation, a total of 366,688 infants have been born in the city, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the total population. Among them, those under one year old are the most numerous, totaling 86,968. In 1953, an average of more than 240 infants were born every day. Compared with 1948 before liberation, 33 more infants were born per 1,000 people on average in that year. The low birth rate before liberation was due to the fact that the income of many working people was insufficient to maintain their lives, and the outdated custom of buying and selling marriages was prevalent in the city. In light industrial factories with more female workers, there were also unreasonable systems such as female workers being demoted or dismissed after giving birth. Therefore, many working people did not dare to marry or have children. After liberation, the lives of the working people have improved year by year, the Marriage Law has been implemented throughout the city, the Labor Insurance Regulations have been generally implemented in large factories, and the reproductive issues of female workers have also received appropriate consideration. Therefore, the working people have the political and economic conditions to establish families. In the past year, more than 24,500 couples in the city applied for marriage. The children they conceived and raised after marriage have also generally received medical and scientific protection. Zhang Yangshi, a female worker in her forties at the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, gave birth to five children before liberation, four of whom died due to illness and insufficient milk. After liberation, she gave birth to two more children, both of whom are healthy. (Xinhua News Agency)

    天津市完成人口调查登记工作
    天津市市内各区和塘沽区的人口调查登记工作已经完成。调查结果说明，天津市解放后的五年当中，市内人口有了显著的增加。从人口年龄比例表上看来，比重最大的是不满一岁到四岁的幼儿。解放以来，全市共出生幼儿三十六万六千六百八十八人，将近全市总人口的六分之一。其中又以不满一岁的为最多，共八万六千九百六十八名。一九五三年内，平均每天要出生二百四十多名。和解放前的一九四八年比较，这一年平均在每一千人口中就多出生幼儿三十三名。解放前人口出生率低的原因，是当时很多劳动人民的收入不足维持生活，市内又流行着买卖婚姻的陋习，在女工较多的轻工业工厂里，还存在着女工生了孩子就被降级或开除等不合理的制度。因此，很多劳动人民不敢结婚，不敢生孩子。解放后，劳动人民的生活逐年改善，全市范围内贯彻执行了婚姻法，大的工厂普遍实行了劳动保险条例，女工的生育问题也受到了适当的照顾。因此，劳动人民在政治上和经济上都有了建立家庭的条件。去年一年内，全市就有二万四千五百多对男女申请结婚。他们在婚后生养的子女，也普遍受到了医疗科学的保护。国营天津第三棉纺织厂四十多岁的女工张杨氏在解放前生过五个孩子，有四个因为疾病和奶水不足而死，解放后她又生了两个孩子，都很健康。　（新华社）
