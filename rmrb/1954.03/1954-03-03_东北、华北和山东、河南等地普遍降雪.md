    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: From February 25th to 28th, widespread snowfall occurred in the vast areas of the Northeast Plain and the North China Plain. Snow was still falling in Beijing as late as March 2nd. In most areas of the Northeast, the ground snow cover reached about 50 millimeters or more. The southern Northeast Plain and the Rehe area, which had lacked rain and snow since last winter, had more snowfall this time. The amount of snow near Shenyang exceeded 200 millimeters. The amount of snow cover on the North China Plain generally reached more than 50 millimeters. The eastern part of Hebei Province, which has been most lacking in water since last winter, had a snow cover of about 70 to 100 millimeters. This snowfall is occurring before the spring plowing, and the snowfall area is precisely the area that has lacked rain and snow the most since last winter, bringing extremely favorable conditions for spring plowing.
    In addition, Shandong and Henan provinces also experienced widespread spring snowfall on February 25th and 26th. After the snowfall, farmers in various places are harrowing the land to preserve moisture and preparing for spring plowing.

    东北、华北和山东、河南等地普遍降雪
    据新华社讯：从二月二十五日到二十八日，东北平原和华北平原广大地区内都普遍降雪。北京直到三月二日，仍在降雪。东北大部地区地面积雪约达五十公厘以上。去年冬季以来雨雪缺少的东北南部平原和热河一带，这次降雪较多。沈阳附近的积雪量超过了二百公厘。华北平原上的积雪量，也普遍达到五十公厘以上。去冬以来最缺水的河北省东部地区，积雪量在七十公厘到一百公厘左右。这一场雪正在春耕之前，而且降雪地区正是去冬至今最缺雨雪的地区，给春耕带来极为有利的条件。
    此外，山东、河南两省也在二月二十五日、二十六日普降春雪。雪后，各地农民都在耙地保墒，准备春耕。
