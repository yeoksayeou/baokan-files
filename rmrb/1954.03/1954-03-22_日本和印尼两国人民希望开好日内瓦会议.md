    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 20th: The Japan Peace Committee held a meeting of its Standing Committee on March 8th. The meeting issued a statement expressing the demands and hopes of the Japanese people for the Geneva Conference and opposing the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement."
    The statement said: After the signing of the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," the Japanese people, who are suffering from the pain of rearmament policies, are eagerly looking forward to the Geneva Conference achieving great success in striving for peace in Asia, and are willing to express the demands and hopes of the Japanese people to the government representatives of all countries participating in the Geneva Conference and the Japanese government. The statement said: For the peace of Asia and the world, it is necessary to fundamentally resolve the Korean and Vietnamese issues. To resolve the above two issues, the principle of national self-determination must be recognized. That is to say, Korean affairs should be handled by Koreans, and Vietnamese affairs should be handled by Vietnamese. The main factor causing tension in Asia is that Asian countries become foreign military bases and their internal affairs are interfered with. We firmly oppose this.
    The statement said: Restoring the rightful seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is absolutely necessary for easing tensions in Asia and the world.
    The statement continued: The Japanese people sincerely hope that the representatives of all countries participating in the Geneva Conference will give deep concern to the Japanese issue. The Japanese people urgently hope that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Japan, all foreign military bases in Japan will be abolished, and that Japan will achieve complete independence.
    The Japanese people do not want Japan to participate in military alliances that are hostile to any country. Therefore, they urgently demand the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement." The Japanese people oppose Japan losing trade freedom, the collapse of peaceful industries, and becoming a military arsenal for Asia as a military-industrial nation. The Japanese people hope and wait to establish normal diplomatic relations and develop trade with China and the Soviet Union.
    The Standing Committee meeting of the Japan Peace Committee also decided to hold rallies throughout the country to concentrate the demands of the Japanese people for the Geneva Conference and strive for the success of the Geneva Conference.
    TASS, Jakarta, March 21st: Indonesian newspapers and the public are looking forward to the Geneva Conference with great interest, hoping that this conference can help to a large extent to resolve outstanding issues peacefully and establish peace in Asia. At the same time, newspapers such as "Harian Rakjat" (People's Daily), "Indonesia Raya" (Greater Indonesia), "Abadi" (Eternal), and "Pedoman" (Guideline) expressed concern about the United States' interference in the Indochina War and its attempts to cobble together a military bloc of Southeast Asian countries. An editorial in "Indonesia Raya" said that the United States' intensified military intervention in Indochina would not have a positive impact on the Geneva Conference. The newspaper demanded that the people of Indochina be given full freedom.
    Antara News Agency broadcast a statement by Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Tambunan, saying that the Vietnamese people will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. The Vietnamese people, like the people of other Asian countries, have full rights to independence. Western countries are trying to stop the progress of history, but this is impossible. In the second half of the twentieth century, colonial rule over Asia will come to an end.
    "Abadi" pointed out the great significance of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference.
    The weekly "Minggu Pagi" (Sunday Morning News) said that the people of Asia hope that the Geneva Conference can resolve outstanding issues and establish lasting peace in Asia and other parts of the world. However, much work still needs to be done to make the conference a success, even before the conference is held. The newspaper said that some facts are contrary to this goal. Everyone knows that the United States is backing the war plans of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. The United States is actively participating in the war against the people of Indochina. The newspaper said that these actions by the United States cannot but make the Asian people, who hope the Geneva Conference will give them a real guarantee of peace, feel worried.

    日本和印尼两国人民希望开好日内瓦会议
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会在三月八日召开常任委员会会议，会议发表了一项声明，表明日本人民对日内瓦会议的要求和希望，并反对美日“共同防御援助协定”。
    声明说：美日“共同防御援助协定”签订后，身受重整军备政策痛苦的日本人民，在翘首盼望日内瓦会议在争取亚洲和平方面获得巨大的成功，并愿向参加日内瓦会议的各国政府代表和日本政府表达日本人民的要求和希望。声明说：为了亚洲和世界的和平，根本解决朝鲜和越南问题是必要的。解决上述两个问题必须承认民族自决原则。这就是说朝鲜事务应该交给朝鲜人去办，越南事务应该交给越南人去做。亚洲各国变成外国的军事基地，它们的内政遭受干涉，这就是亚洲局势紧张的主要因素。我们对此坚决表示反对。
    声明说：恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的应有地位，对于缓和亚洲和世界的紧张局势是绝对必要的。
    声明接着说：日本人民热诚地希望参加日内瓦会议的各国代表对日本问题给以深切的关心。日本人民迫切希望从日本撤退所有的外国军队，取消在日本的所有的外国军事基地，使日本得到完全的独立。
    日本人民不希望日本参加和任何国家为敌的军事同盟，因此，迫切要求废除美日“安全条约”和美日“共同防御援助协定”。日本人民反对日本失去贸易自由、和平工业倒闭和作为一个军事工业国家而变成亚洲的军火库。日本人民希望并等待着和中苏两国建立正常的邦交、发展贸易。
    日本拥护和平委员会常任委员会会议并决定在全国各地举行集会，以集中日本人民对日内瓦会议的要求，争取日内瓦会议获得成功。
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社雅加达二十日讯：印尼报纸和公众以极大的兴趣展望着日内瓦会议，希望这个会议可以在很大的程度上有助于以和平方式解决悬而未决的问题，并建立亚洲和平。同时，像“人民日报”、“独立报”、“永恒报”、“指南针报”这样一些报纸，对于美国干涉印度支那战争和企图拼凑东南亚国家军事集团的举动表示不安。“独立报”的社论说，美国加紧在军事上干涉印度支那，决不会对日内瓦会议产生有利的影响。该报要求给印度支那人民以充分的自由。
    安塔拉通讯社播发了国会副主席谭布兰的一篇声明，他说，越南人民一定会排除一切困难取得胜利。越南人民像亚洲其他国家的人民一样有充分的独立权利。西方国家企图阻止历史前进，但这是不可能的。在二十世纪下半叶，对亚洲的殖民统治将寿终正寝。
      “永恒报”指出了中华人民共和国参加日内瓦会议的重大意义。
    周刊“星期日传信报”说，亚洲人民都希望日内瓦会议能够解决悬而未决的问题，并建立亚洲和世界其他地方的持久和平。但是，要使会议成功还需要做很多的工作，甚至在会议召开前也是如此。该报说，但是有些事实违背着这个目标。大家都知道，美国在为李承晚和蒋介石的战争计划撑腰。美国在积极参加对印度支那人民作战。该报说，美国的这些举动不能不使希望日内瓦会议给他们一个真正的和平保证的亚洲人民感到忧虑。
