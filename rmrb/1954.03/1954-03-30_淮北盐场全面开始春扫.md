The Huaibei Salt Administration Bureau's subordinate fields fully commenced spring sweeping in March.

This year's sweeping conditions are good, and preparations have been sufficient: All tidal flats, large embankments, and depressions have been filled with water, with water storage exceeding last year's by 40 percent, and with high concentration and ample brine. Not only have the ponds been filled, but many earthen brine ponds and small depressions are also full of brine. The connection with the flats was also one month earlier. Therefore, this year's sweeping commenced twenty days earlier.

As soon as sweeping began, salt workers actively produced, adding a large number of drying grids to create more wealth for the country. Within three days of sweeping, each section of beach at the Taipei Kai Tai location had scooped five grids, with sufficient brine. The Kai Wu embankment team scooped seven grids per section, with plans to add ten more. Guanxi Field actively and steadily added drying grids, quickly scooping more than 1,600 drying grids.

On the 19th, a strong wind suddenly blew, and the weather turned very cold. People could not stand on the grid embankments, and could not open their eyes. However, not a single salt worker remained idle at home. In twenty-five days, all fields scooped a total of more than 9,000 grids, exceeding last year's sweeping grid scooping by 60 percent.

### 淮北盐场全面开始春扫

    淮北盐场全面开始春扫
    淮北盐管局所属各场于三月间全面开始春扫。
    今年开扫条件好，准备工作做的充分：所有夹滩、大圩、洼地都打满了水，蓄水量超过去年百分之四十，浓度又高，卤水也多，不但达到了塘塘满，许多土卤塘和小洼里也盛满了卤；和滩提前一个月。因此，今年开扫提前了二十天。
    一开扫，盐工们积极生产，大量增添晒格，为国家多创造财富。台北开太所在开扫三天内，每份滩就舀了五块格子，卤水足实；开五圩小组每份滩舀了七块，计划再增加十块。灌西场积极稳步地增添晒格，很快就舀了一千六百多块晒格。
    十九日那一天，忽然刮大风，天气很冷。格埝上站不住人，眼睛睁不开。但是盐工们没有一个闲在家里。二十五天工夫，各场共舀了九千多块，超过去年开扫舀格百分之六十。
