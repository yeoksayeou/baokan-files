    Celebrating New Achievements in China's Electric Power Industry Construction

    The 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in Northeast China has been completed and officially began transmitting electricity on January 27th. This is another encouraging piece of good news in our country's industrialization endeavor.

    The completion of the 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in Northeast China plays a significant role in further developing various industries in the southern region of Northeast China. The southern region of Northeast China is now the center of our country's heavy industry. In recent years, due to the rapid development of industrial production and capital construction, especially the large-scale construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Base, the demand for electricity has greatly increased. The original power supply capacity could no longer meet the industrial electricity needs in the current large-scale construction. However, the power base in northeastern Northeast China has greatly improved its power generation capacity after restoration and expansion in recent years. But because there was only an old line with a small transmission capacity connecting the nearly four hundred kilometers of remote roads, it was impossible to transmit a large amount of electricity from the north, resulting in a situation of electricity shortage in the south and electricity backlog in the north. Now, the completion of this 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line closely links the industrial area of southern Northeast China with the power base in the north. From now on, the southern industrial area can continuously obtain a large supply of cheap electricity. Various new factories and new mines with high electricity consumption can be rapidly built or put into production with a sufficient supply of electricity.

    The victorious construction process of the 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in Northeast China fully demonstrates the Chinese people's high enthusiasm and courageous spirit for realizing the country's socialist industrialization. The construction of the 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line is a technically complex and large-scale modern engineering project. We had almost no experience in this area and encountered many difficulties during the construction process. However, the urgent need for the project encouraged the leading cadres and all staff of the construction project to overcome difficulties with the greatest determination. They worked hard to learn and study advanced Soviet technology, constantly consulted Soviet experts, and gave full play to their high initiative and creativity, and finally successfully completed the design and construction tasks of the project. More than 100 factories and mining enterprises in Shenyang, Anshan, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places also overcame many difficulties, producing nearly a thousand kinds of products and manufacturing many important materials that had never been made before to meet the needs of the construction project. The Communist Party committees and the people's governments near the line actively mobilized to help the project proceed. As a result of the great efforts of all parties, China's first ultra-high-voltage power transmission line built by itself was finally erected victoriously in the Northeast wilderness.

    In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, fully utilize our country's abundant power resources, and make the power supply economical, safe, and reliable, it is necessary to build thousands of transmission lines to form a strong power grid to connect power bases and industrial areas across the country. Therefore, the proportion of transmission line construction in my country's future industrial construction will increase day by day. Through the construction of the 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line in Northeast China, we have now initially built the first team for constructing high-voltage power transmission line projects, trained some leading backbones, and explored some experience in constructing high-voltage power transmission line projects, creating extremely favorable conditions for China's future electric power industry construction. The successful construction of the 220 kV ultra-high-voltage power transmission line tells us: As long as we learn from the advanced experience of Soviet national electrification with a high degree of perseverance and aggressive spirit, and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, we will be able to overcome all difficulties in the construction and accelerate the speed of electric power industry construction and complete the great cause of national electrification.

    庆祝我国电力工业建设的新成就
    东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线路已建设完成，并已于一月二十七日正式开始送电。这是我国工业化事业中又一个令人鼓舞的喜讯。
    东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线路的建设完成，对进一步发展我国东北南部地区的各种工业，有着重大的作用。东北南部地区现在是我国重工业的中心，这几年来由于工业生产和基本建设的迅速发展，特别是鞍山钢铁基地的大规模兴建，对电力的要求大大增长，原有的供电能力已不能满足当前大规模建设中工业用电的需要。而东北北部的动力基地，这几年来经过了恢复和扩建以后，发电能力已大为提高。但因为在将近四百公里的遥远路程上，只有一条送电能力不大的旧线来联系，不能把北部的电力大量往外输送，以致形成了南部缺乏电力、北部电力积压的状况。现在这条二十二万伏超高压送电线路的建设完成，就使东北南部的工业区和北部的动力基地紧密联系起来。从此，南部工业区就可以源源不绝地得到大量廉价电力的供应，各种大量用电的自动化和电气化的新工厂和新矿山就能在充裕的电力供应下，迅速地兴建起来或投入生产。
    东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线的胜利建设过程中，充分表现了我国人民为实现国家社会主义工业化的高度热情和勇敢精神。二十二万伏超高压送电线路建设是一项技术复杂、规模庞大的近代化工程，我们在这方面几乎完全没有经验，在建设过程中曾遇到了许多困难。但工程的迫切需要鼓舞了建设工程的领导干部和全体工作人员以最大的决心去战胜困难，他们努力学习和钻研苏联的先进技术，不断地向苏联专家请教，并发挥了高度的积极性和创造精神，终于胜利地完成了工程的设计和施工任务。沈阳、鞍山、天津、上海等地的一百多家厂矿企业也克服了许多困难，生产出近千种产品，制造了过去从未造过的许多重要器材，以供应建设工程的需要；线路附近的共产党党委和人民政府积极动员起来，帮助工程的进行。由于各方面巨大努力的结果，新中国第一条自己建设的超高压送电线，终于胜利地在东北原野上竖立了起来。
    为着实现国家的社会主义工业化，充分地利用我国丰富的动力资源，使电力供应达到经济、安全和可靠，就必须建设起千百条送电线路，组成强大的电力网，把各地的动力基地和工业区联系起来，所以送电线路的建设在我国今后工业建设中的比重将日益增加。通过这次东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线的建设，现在我们已初步建成了第一支建设高压送电线路工程的队伍，培养了一些领导骨干，摸索到一些建设高压送电线路工程的经验，为我国今后的电力工业建设创造了极为有利的条件。二十二万伏超高压送电线建设成功的事实告诉了我们：只要我们以高度的坚韧性和积极的进取精神，努力学习苏联国家电气化的先进经验，发扬群众的积极性和创造性，我们就能够克服建设途中的一切困难，加快电力工业建设的速度，完成国家电气化的伟大事业。
