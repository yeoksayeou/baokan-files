    The agreement reached at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on holding the Geneva Conference, thanks to the initiative and efforts of the Soviet Union, has garnered widespread attention from public opinion of various persuasions, from Asia to Europe. People are placing the utmost concern and expectations on holding the Geneva Conference to resolve the Korean question and restore peace in Indochina.
    However, the American reactionary clique has adopted the opposite attitude. They are doing their utmost to belittle the significance of the Berlin Conference agreement and openly spreading the notion that the Geneva Conference has a "grim future." This fully exposes their unwillingness to restore peace in Indochina and their wholehearted desire to continue obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, keeping the Korean armistice in a state of instability. The United States International News Service said on February 22: American
  "Far East diplomatic officials believe that the Korean peace conference to be held in Geneva in April has virtually no chance of success. ... As long as the Cold War continues, Korea will remain indefinitely divided along the current military demarcation line." The Associated Press openly stated on February 18:
  "Such a conference can only confirm the division of Korea, just as the Berlin Conference confirmed the division of Germany, and is unlikely to achieve anything else."
    At the same time, in order to cover up their sinister conspiracy, these groups continue to adopt a clumsy trick that has long been bankrupt,妄想 trying to shift the responsibility for their premeditated obstruction of the resolution of the Korean question onto the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The United States cannot shirk its responsibility for obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The reason why the Korean Political Conference could not be convened is the result of the United States' consistent unwillingness to resolve the Korean question at the conference table after the Korean armistice. As early as August 7 last year, United Press International clamored: "Many Americans today are prepared to write off the political conference as a failure even before it begins." Subsequently, people saw that the United States, at the second session of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly, regardless of the wishes of the majority of countries in the world, resolutely opposed the adoption of a reasonable round-table format for the political conference and obstructed the convening of the political conference on the issue of the members of the political conference. Only due to the pressure of world public opinion did the United States have to send Dean to Panmunjom to hold bilateral talks. But at the time, Childs, a columnist for the "Washington Post," which was close to the U.S. State Department, revealed: The United States agreed to hold bilateral talks merely "to dispel the doubts of European and Asian representatives in the United Nations, who have begun to feel that the United States does not want to hold political talks." It was with Washington's instruction of merely wanting to perfunctorily appease public opinion and not to reach an agreement that the U.S. representative Dean, after using delaying tactics to drag out the talks for some time, fabricated an unreasonable excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks. Although the Korean and Chinese sides made four solemn requests to the U.S. side to immediately resume the bilateral talks, the United States stubbornly refused. This approach by the United States has aroused widespread condemnation from world public opinion.
    In order to maintain the tense situation, other measures taken by the United States to keep the Korean armistice in an unstable state are also being intensified. Just as the Berlin Conference was being held, the U.S. Senate hurriedly ratified the U.S.-Rhee "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed last August. U.S. warmongers and reactionary congressmen made no secret of their intention to use this treaty to encourage the Rhee Syngman group's adventurous activities and create obstacles to the resolution of the Korean question. According to this treaty, the United States has the "right" to "deploy U.S. naval, land and air forces" in South Korea, which is clearly contrary to the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding consultation on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    The United States' intensified expansion of the Rhee Syngman puppet army and the activities of instigating Rhee Syngman to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek remnants and the Philippines to piece together an "anti-communist alliance" further exposed the true intentions of the United States. On February 28, General Taylor, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army invading Korea, announced the establishment of two new Rhee puppet army divisions. In total, in the more than half a year since the armistice, the United States has expanded the Rhee puppet army from sixteen divisions to twenty divisions. Anderson, commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, also revealed that Washington is considering a plan proposed by the South Korean government that "requests the establishment of a South Korean air force with twelve squadrons, including nine squadrons of Saber jet fighter-bombers." Recently, Rhee Syngman even arrogantly clamored to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Rhee Syngman's "visiting group" has set off to Saigon and some Southeast Asian countries to carry out conspiratorial activities. This is obviously instigated by the United States.
    At the same time, the United States has not only committed the serious incident of openly tearing up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and forcibly kidnapping Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, which is known to the world, but also continues to create other incidents to undermine the implementation of the armistice agreement. For example, with regard to the provision of the armistice agreement that both sides cease to import reinforcement combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition from outside Korea, the U.S. side has consistently failed to comply with the agreement. According to the materials reported by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in South Korea alone, from the armistice to the end of January this year, the howitzers, cannon barrels and breech mechanisms shipped into South Korea by the U.S. side could be assembled into at least two hundred and six cannons. In addition, a large number of combat aircraft and other weapons were illegally imported. The U.S. side also openly proposed to freely transport reinforcement combat materials into South Korea in the name of "parts" and "dismantled parts."
    The number of incidents in which U.S. aircraft illegally intruded into our side's airspace is also increasing. From the armistice to the end of January this year, according to incomplete statistics, there were as many as two hundred batches and four hundred and forty-two sorties. In the ten days from February 2 to February 12 this year, U.S. military aircraft committed twenty-two provocative incidents of intruding into our side's territory.
    The United States' lawless behavior in Korea, like its entire Far East policy, contains the malicious intention of stubbornly antagonizing the People's Republic of China. After the Berlin Conference, the clamor of extreme reactionaries in the U.S. Congress against recognizing the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in international affairs has increased. The U.S. government's "blockade" and "embargo" measures against our country, which it forced various countries to implement after launching the war of aggression against Korea, are still unwilling to change. Recently, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford has been clamoring again for his "plan to blockade the Chinese coast."
    This series of conspiracies by the United States can only lead people to believe that it is attempting to prevent the Berlin Conference agreement from helping to resolve the Korean question, in order to maintain the tense situation in the Far East. This is clearly not permissible to all peace-loving people. Public opinion in Asia and around the world believes that the Geneva Conference should complete its task, help the Korean people restore national unity on the basis of solving their own problems, and transition Korea from armistice to lasting peace. If the United States disregards this legitimate desire, it will definitely not get any good results for itself.

    美国继续企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决
    李高
    在苏联的创议和努力下，柏林四国外长会议所达成的举行日内瓦会议的协议，获得了从亚洲到欧洲的各种不同倾向的舆论的普遍重视。人们都对举行日内瓦会议来解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平，寄予最大的关心和期望。
    可是，美国反动集团却采取了相反的态度。他们竭力贬抑柏林会议这个协议的意义，并公然大肆散布日内瓦会议“前途阴暗”的论调。这充分暴露出他们不愿恢复印度支那的和平，并一心要继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，使朝鲜停战继续处于不稳定状态。美国国际新闻社二月二十二日说：美国
  “远东的外交界负责人士认为，四月间在日内瓦举行的朝鲜和平会议实际上没有成功的机会。……只要冷战继续一天，朝鲜将一直按目前的军事分界线无限期地分裂下去。”美联社在二月十八日公然说：
  “这种会议除了将肯定朝鲜的分裂，如像柏林会议肯定德国的分裂一样外，不可能有别的成就。”
    同时，这些集团为了掩盖自己不可告人的阴谋，就又继续采取一种早已破产了的拙劣手法，妄想把他们这种预先计划的阻碍朝鲜问题解决的责任推到中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的身上。
    美国阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决的责任，是推卸不掉的。朝鲜政治会议之所以不能召开，就是美国在朝鲜停战后一直不愿使朝鲜问题在会议桌上解决的结果。早在去年八月七日，合众社就扬言道：“很多美国人今日准备甚至在政治会议尚未开始之前就把它当作一个失败的会议而一笔勾销。”随后，人们就看到美国在第七届联合国大会第二期会议上不顾世界大多数国家的意愿，坚决反对政治会议采取合理的圆桌会议的形式，并在政治会议成员问题上阻碍政治会议的召开。只是由于世界舆论的压力，美国才不得不派遣迪安到板门店举行双方会谈。但在当时，接近美国国务院的“华盛顿邮报”的专栏作家柴尔兹就透露：美国同意举行双方会谈，仅仅是“为了要消除联合国中的欧、亚代表们的疑虑，他们已开始感觉到美国不想举行政治会谈。”正是带着华盛顿这种只是为了搪塞舆论，而不要达成协议的指示，美国代表迪安在用拖延战术，把会谈拖过了一些时日以后，就制造了一个毫无道理的借口中断了双方会谈。虽然朝中方面向美方四次提出了立即恢复双方会议的严正要求，美国仍横蛮加以拒绝。美国这种做法，引起了世界公众舆论的普遍谴责。
    为了维持紧张局势，美国所采取的使朝鲜停战处于不稳定状态的其他措施，也在加紧进行。正当柏林会议举行的时候，美国参议院赶忙批准了去年八月所签订的美李“共同防御条约”。美国好战分子和反动议员们毫不掩饰他们是企图利用这个条约来鼓励李承晚集团的冒险活动，并为解决朝鲜问题布下障碍。根据这个条约，美国有“权利”在南朝鲜“部署美国海陆空军部队”，而这显然是与停战协定关于协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队及和平解决朝鲜问题的规定相违背的。
    美国加紧扩充李承晚伪军，指使李承晚与蒋介石残匪和菲律宾拼凑“反共联盟”的活动，更进一步暴露了美国的真实意图。二月二十八日，侵朝美军第八军军长泰勒又宣布成立了两个新的李伪军师。总计停战后的半年多中，美国已把李伪军由十六个师扩大到二十个师了。美国第五航空队司令安德逊还透露，华盛顿正在考虑南朝鲜政府提出的
  “要求成立一支拥有十二个中队的韩国空军，其中包括九个中队的佩刀式喷气战斗轰炸机”的计划。最近李承晚竟狂妄地叫嚣着要派兵去参加侵略越南的战争。李承晚的“访问团”已出发到西贡和东南亚一些国家进行阴谋活动。这显然是美国所指使的。
    与此同时，美国不但在战俘问题上做出了举世共知的公然撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”协议强劫朝中战俘的严重事件，而且还不断地制造其他的事件来破坏停战协定的实施。例如，对停战协定所规定的双方停止自朝鲜境外运入增援性作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药一项，美方就一直不遵守协议。仅据在南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组报告的材料，自停战后到今年一月底，美方运入南朝鲜的榴弹炮、大炮的炮筒与后座机械，至少可以装配成二百零六门大炮。另外还非法运入了大量的作战飞机及其他武器。美方并公然提出要以“零件”和“拆散件”为名把增援性作战物资自由地运入南朝鲜。
    美国飞机非法侵入我方地区上空的事件也越来越多了，从停战后到今年一月底，据不完全统计就有两百批、四百四十二架次之多。今年二月二日到十二日的十天中，美方军用飞机又发生了二十二次侵入我方地区的挑衅事件。
    美国在朝鲜的胡作非为，和它现在仍然奉行的整个远东政策一样，都包藏着顽固地敌视中华人民共和国的祸心。柏林会议后，美国国会内的极端反动分子反对承认中华人民共和国在国际事务中的合法地位的叫嚣更多起来了。美国政府在发动侵朝战争后强迫各国实行对我国的“封锁”“禁运”措施，至今仍不愿有所改变。最近美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福就在重新叫嚷他的“封锁中国海岸的计划”。
    美国这一连串的阴谋活动，只能使人认为它是在企图要使柏林会议的协议不能有助于解决朝鲜问题，以便维持远东紧张局势。这显然是一切爱好和平的人民所不能容许的。亚洲和世界各国公众舆论都认为日内瓦会议应该完成其任务，帮助朝鲜人民在他们自己解决自己问题的基础上恢复国家统一，并使朝鲜从停战转入持久的和平。美国如果漠视这个正当的愿望，决然不可能使自己得到什么好的结果。
