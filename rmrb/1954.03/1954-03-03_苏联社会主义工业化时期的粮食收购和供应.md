    Grain Acquisition and Supply During the Soviet Socialist Industrialization Period
    Zhai Liangchao, Meng Zhenhu
    Grain acquisition and supply is an important issue in realizing the socialist industrialization. Because in the process of realizing socialist industrialization, the ranks of the working class will inevitably continue to expand, and their wage levels will gradually increase. At the same time, areas that produce cash crops must also continue to expand. In order to meet the needs of employees and farmers producing cash crops for grain, and to take into account the interests of the working class and peasants on the grain issue at the same time, so as to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and ensure the victory of socialist industrialization, it is necessary to smoothly resolve the issue of grain acquisition and supply.
    The Soviet Union regarded grain acquisition and supply as a very important matter during the period of socialist industrialization. In the early stage of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, the demand for commercial grain by urban and rural working people had already increased sharply, but the state encountered difficulties in acquiring grain and could not fully meet the needs. The difficulty in state grain acquisition, in addition to the kulak class resisting selling grain to the state and conspiring to undermine the state's grain policy, the basic reason was that the growth rate of commercial grain production in the Soviet Union at that time lagged behind the growth rate of commercial grain demand. Although the grain sowing area and total output of the Soviet Union in 1926-1927 had reached the pre-war level, the commercial grain portion of the total grain output was reduced by half compared with the pre-war period. Why did commercial grain decrease so much? Stalin pointed out: "This is primarily and mainly because after the October Revolution, the agricultural structure of our country has changed from huge landlord economies and huge kulak economies with extremely high commercial grain output to small peasant economies and middle peasant economies with very low commercial grain output." This means that at that time, the "main foundation of agriculture was small peasant economy with very low commercial grain output" [1]. At that time, the grain produced by middle and poor peasants accounted for more than 85 percent of the country's total grain output, but the commercial grain they sold accounted for only 10.2 percent of their total production. This situation illustrates the crux of the grain difficulty in the Soviet Union at that time. Therefore, to solve the grain problem, the fundamental solution is to gradually transform the scattered small peasant economy into a large collective farm economy and increase grain production. But this is a long-term task. And the grain problem was urgently to be solved at that time. In order to solve the urgent problems at that time, the Soviet state strengthened the grain acquisition work and organized a planned grain supply for residents.
    The Soviet Union adopted the following measures at that time to strengthen grain acquisition work and increase grain resources: First, strengthening the state's planning and management of the grain market, and adopting measures such as stopping loans to private purchasers, stipulating that the freight rate for private merchants must be higher than the freight rate for socialist enterprises, taking over enterprises that used to be engaged in the initial processing of agricultural raw materials by private capitalists, especially grain processing enterprises, and expanding the state-owned and cooperative purchasing network to gradually squeeze private purchasers out of the purchasing market. Second, adopting extraordinary measures against the kulak class that undermined the state's grain acquisition. Third, rectifying and reorganizing state-owned purchasing institutions, and merging all state-owned grain purchasing institutions into a unified grain purchasing agency. Fourth, changing the state's method of purchasing grain from purchasing at market prices on the market to purchasing by pre-purchase contracts (i.e., order contracts). All these measures, especially the new purchasing methods, played a huge role in solving the grain difficulties at that time.
    Pre-purchase contract was the main method for purchasing agricultural products at that time. This method was initially only applied to the purchase of cotton, and later it was extended to the purchase of sugar beets, tobacco, and hemp. By 1928-1929, grain and livestock products were also using this purchasing method. Because pre-purchase contracts became the basic method for purchasing grain at that time, acquisition on the market retreated to a secondary position.
    The pre-purchase contract is a large number of order contracts signed by the state and cooperative purchasing institutions with collective farms and individual farmers according to the state's purchasing plan. It has become a mass contract system. It is a contract or system negotiated with farmers on a voluntary basis through persuasion and education on the production and supply of agricultural products needed by the state. It is a means of carrying out socialist transformation of the small peasant economy through relatively simple forms of cooperation. The pre-purchase contract stipulates the quantity, quality, and price of the commodity, and stipulates the obligations of the supplier and the purchaser. For example, it stipulates that the supplier should promote reasonable crop rotation, adopt pure variety planting, and ensure sales on time, etc. Purchasing institutions should provide agricultural producers with seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools in advance and provide them with technical assistance, guarantee priority and preferential supply of industrial products and grain to agricultural producers after the acquisition, and at the same time, in many cases, they can also provide loans of cash and consumer goods in advance. Therefore, the pre-purchase contract can raise the form of commodity connection between urban and rural areas to a higher stage and lay a solid foundation for the combination of production between urban and rural areas.
    There are several benefits to using the pre-purchase contract method for acquisition: First, adopting the pre-purchase contract method for acquisition can guarantee the state's need for agricultural products, increase the state's reserve materials, especially grain materials, and thus can strongly support the construction of socialist industrialization. In 1929, the grain ordered by the state through pre-purchase contracts accounted for 54 percent of the sown area of spring grain, 44 percent of the sown area of autumn grain, all of the cotton, most of the sugar beets, and half of the flax. Second, adopting the method of pre-purchase acquisition can strengthen the state's planned leadership of agricultural production, make industry and agriculture closely linked, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Because it can not only guarantee that farmers sell products at prices higher than market prices, but also meet farmers' demand for industrial products, and enable farmers to get help from the state. Third, it can help realize the plan of cooperatives and promote the development of agricultural collectivization. The benefits that the state gives to farmers according to pre-purchase contracts have enabled rural supply and marketing cooperatives to develop rapidly and universally. In particular, the state gives more preferential conditions to agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms, which greatly stimulated farmers to move in the direction of collectivization. Therefore, Stalin believed that the universal implementation of the pre-purchase contract system, the establishment of agricultural machinery stations, and the development of cooperatives as much as possible are the bridges for working farmers to move towards collectivization. Fourth, it can strengthen the leadership of the socialist economy and weaken the position of private capital activities. Because the state only gives the preferential treatment given to farmers according to pre-purchase contracts to poor and middle peasants. For the rich peasants, the state does not sign contracts with them at all, but only stipulates fixed tax tasks for them, and purchases the surplus grain of the rich peasants at fixed prices. Therefore, through the pre-purchase contract, it is possible to combine the small peasant economy and the socialist economy in a planned way, so that the peasants can get rid of their dependence on private merchants and rich peasants. Thereby expanding the socialist position in the countryside and guaranteeing the state's leading role in the agricultural product market and prices.
    Comrade Stalin once pointed out the necessity and significance of the pre-purchase contract system: "These new and universal forms of transaction between cities and villages according to the order contract system... are precisely a great progress for our various organizations in strengthening the planned socialist leadership of the national economy" [2]. The Party and the government, in accordance with Stalin's instructions, steadfastly and widely developed the purchasing method of pre-purchase contracts during the period of socialist industrialization, and thus achieved victory on the grain front.
    The state's grain purchases have greatly increased during the period of national industrialization, but with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the rapid increase in people's income, and the sharp increase in the needs of the working people for food. In 1927, the wheat flour consumed by workers reached 170 percent of that in 1923, sugar reached 265.1 percent, meat reached 189.5 percent, milk and dairy products reached 185.2 percent, and eggs reached 287.5 percent. Farmers' diets also have similar improvements. Under such circumstances, the growth rate of commercial grain still cannot keep up with the growth rate of grain needs, and the phenomenon of grain shortage still exists. In addition, there were free markets and speculative behaviors at that time. If the grain supply was not adjusted and distributed appropriately, workers and farmers in technical crop areas would not be able to buy grain, prices would fluctuate, and people's lives and national industry would be seriously affected. Therefore, at the end of 1928, the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet government decided to implement a fixed quota supply system for grain. As pointed out in the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in November 1934: "The shopping coupon supply system was particularly necessary during this period, because although the prices in the free market were much higher, and there were speculators in this regard, the supply of workers was distributed at fixed state prices. Only by limiting the reserves through this system can the supply of cities and industrial areas be fully guaranteed, the priority supply of the most important central areas and shock workers in production can be guaranteed, and the producers of agricultural raw materials (cotton, flax, hemp, tobacco, etc.) can be guaranteed to receive the state price. Grain supply in order to increase technical crops and increase the purchase of industrial raw materials" [3]. Therefore, the implementation of the fixed quota supply system was a necessary form of trade in the Soviet Union at that time, and it was of great significance to socialist construction and the socialist transformation of the national economy.
    The purpose of implementing the fixed quota supply system is to enable the new workers needed for the basic construction of industry and the start of new enterprises to get grain supply; to maximize the consumption of the working class and limit the consumption of the remaining exploiting classes in urban and rural areas; to ensure the completion of the national plan and stimulate the increase of labor productivity. In addition, the purpose of the fixed quota supply system is also to eliminate the opportunity for speculators to carry out speculative activities by taking advantage of the grain shortage.
    Therefore, the fixed quota supply system must be implemented in accordance with the following items: 1. Ensure the needs of various departments of socialist construction; 2. Provide differential supply according to production indicators to ensure the smooth completion of the production plan; 3. Strive to eliminate the mobility of the working class in various enterprises; 4. Stimulate the growth of labor productivity. At the end of 1930, in order to better implement this system, the Soviet Union formulated a list of cities supplied by the state and a list of resident supply grades. The supply grades are divided into four types: special grade, first grade, second grade and third grade. The residents supplied according to the special grade list include workers and other laborers in Moscow, Leningrad and Baku, as well as coal miners in Donbass, Shakhty and Karaganda, underground workers in Kuzbass and steel workers in Donbass, their quotas are the highest. The first-grade list includes workers and other laborers in the ferrous metal industry and non-ferrous metal industry. The second-grade list includes workers in the match, paper, glass, porcelain and other industrial sectors. The third-grade list includes other workers and laborers not included in the first three lists. The number of people supplied by the state at fixed quotas and the amount of quotas depend on the amount of grain resources controlled by the state.
    The fixed quota grain supply system was initially implemented only in individual cities. After 1928, it was popularized in cities throughout the country. In 1930, the number of people supplied by the state reached 26 million, and then it increased even more. The fixed quota supply system started with grain, and later gradually expanded to industrial consumer goods. With the rapid development of industry and the growth of agricultural production, the fixed quota supply system for some industrial products was abolished in less than two years, and only the maximum purchase limit was stipulated. The fixed quota supply of grain was maintained until the completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture (i.e., the end of 1934), when it was announced to be abolished.
    The organizations responsible for the fixed quota supply were initially only consumer cooperatives (at that time, state-owned retail trade had not yet developed). Later, in order to better coordinate the progress of the production plan, worker supply offices were organized in industrial enterprises to be specifically responsible for supplying employees of the enterprise. Public catering enterprises have gained extensive development during this period. It has become a supplementary source of the fixed quota supply system and has played a great role in improving the workers' diet.
    The role of the fixed quota supply system in ensuring the needs of urban and rural working people can be proved by the growth of commodity circulation during this period. If the commodity circulation in 1926-1927 is regarded as 100, then it increased to 160.4 in 1928-1929. In the entire commodity circulation, the socialist component is growing relatively and absolutely, while the capitalist component is declining. During the period from 1926 to 1929, the proportion of private commerce in retail trade had dropped from 32 percent to 13.5 percent, and it was almost completely squeezed out in wholesale trade. The fixed quota supply system played a huge role in accelerating the struggle of socialism against capitalism.
    The Soviet Union's fixed quota supply system at that time is essentially different from the rationing system in the United Kingdom and Japan during the period of their rule over China. The former was implemented on the basis of rapid production development and a sharp increase in the needs of the working people, in order to ensure the needs of the urban and rural working people, ensure the success of socialist construction, and eliminate capitalism. The latter is a means for the bourgeoisie to further plunder the blood and sweat of the people on the basis of production shrinking and the poverty of the working people.
    The experience of the Soviet Union in solving the grain problem during the period of socialist industrialization is of great practical significance to our country today. In the past four years, our country's grain production has exceeded the pre-war level, but the foundation of our country's agricultural production is still the small peasant economy, and the grain commodity rate of the small peasant economy is quite low; in addition, with the improvement of farmers' lives in recent years, many surplus grain households are not urgently in need of selling grain for turnover; especially the existence of free markets and the speculation and disruption of grain merchants have further fueled the mentality of surplus grain households to hoard and wait, wait for high prices, and are unwilling to sell quickly. On the other hand, with the growth of industry and urban population, the expansion of agricultural cash crop areas, the improvement of the lives of all people, and the increase in the national population, the demand for grain will inevitably increase. Therefore, during the period of socialist industrialization, we must always pay attention to the grain problem.
    The fundamental way for our country to solve the grain problem is to actively develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement and gradually lead farmers towards collectivization. However, this method must take effect in a fairly long period. In order to solve the current urgent needs, strengthening the state's acquisition and supply of grain has also become an important task in our country's socialist industrialization period. The Soviet Union has provided us with many valuable experiences in this regard. We should study these experiences in depth and apply them appropriately to actual work.

    苏联社会主义工业化时期的粮食收购和供应
    翟良超　孟振虎
    粮食收购和供应是实现社会主义工业化事业中的一个重要问题。因为在实现社会主义工业化的过程中，工人阶级的队伍必然不断地扩大，他们的工资水平逐步提高。同时，出产技术作物的地区也要不断扩大，为满足职工群众和生产技术作物的农民对粮食的需要，为要在粮食问题上同时照顾工人阶级和农民的利益，以便巩固工农联盟，保证社会主义工业化的胜利，就必须顺利地解决粮食的收购和供应问题。
    苏联在社会主义工业化时期中，就是把粮食收购和供应当作一种很重要的事情来看待的。苏联实行社会主义工业化初期，城乡劳动人民对商品粮食的需要已经猛烈地增长，而国家收购粮食时却遇到了困难，不能充分满足需要，国家收购粮食所以发生困难，除了由于富农阶级抗拒把粮食卖给国家并阴谋破坏国家粮食政策外，其基本原因就在于当时苏联商品粮食产量的增长速度落后于商品粮食需要增长的速度。一九二六—一九二七年度苏联的粮食播种面积和总产量虽然已经达到了战前水平，但粮食总产量中的商品粮部分却较战前减少了二分之
  一。为什么商品粮这样大量减少了呢？斯大林指出：“这首先和主要是因为在十月革命发生后，我国农业结构发生了变化，已从商品粮食出产量极多的巨大地主经济和巨大富农经济，过渡到了商品粮食出产量极少的小农经济和中农经济。”这就是说，当时苏联“农业底主要基础，是商品粮食出产量极少的小农经济”〔一〕。当时中农和贫农所生产的粮食占全国粮食总产量的百分之八十五以上，但他们所卖的商品粮却仅占其生产总量的百分之十
  一点二。这种情况说明了当时苏联粮食困难的症结所在。因此，要解决粮食问题，其根本办法就是逐渐地把分散的小农经济变为大的集体农庄经济，增加粮食生产。但这是一个较长期的工作。而当时粮食问题是急待解决的，苏维埃国家为解决当时的迫切问题，就加强了粮食收购工作并组织了有计划的居民粮食供应。
    苏联当时对加强粮食收购工作，增加粮食资源采取了如下措施：首先是加强国家对粮食市场的计划和管理，并采用停止对私营采购商的贷款，规定私商运货的运价必须高于社会主义企业运货的运价，把过去交给私人资本家进行农产品原料最初加工的企业特别是粮食加工企业收归国家经营，扩大国营及合作社的采购网等办法把私营采购商逐渐从采购市场上排挤出去。第二，对破坏国家粮食收购的富农阶级采取非常手段。第三，对国营采购机构进行整顿和改组，将所有国营粮食采购机构合并为统一的粮食采购机关。第四，改变了国家采购粮食的方法，由从前在市场上按市价采购转变为按预购合同（即定货合同）采购的方法。所有这些措施，特别是新的采购方法，对于解决当时粮食困难起了巨大的作用。
    预购合同是当时对农产品采购的主要方法。这种方法起初只应用在采购棉花上，后来就推广到甜菜、烟和麻的采购上。到了一九二八——一九二九年，就是粮食和畜产品也都采用这种采购方法了。由于预购合同成为当时采购粮食的基本方法，在市场上的收购便退而居于次要的地位。
    预购合同是国家和合作社的采购机构根据国家的采购计划和集体农庄、个体农民所订立的大批定货合同，它成了一种群众性的合同制度，它是通过对农民说服教育，在自愿基础上和农民商定的关于生产和供给国家所需农产品的一种合同或制度。它是通过比较简单的合作形式来对小农经济实行社会主义改造的手段。预购合同上规定了商品的数量、质量和价格，规定了供应者和采购者的义务。例如，规定供应者方面要推行合理的循环播种，采用纯品种种植，保证按期出售等等。采购机构应预先供应农业生产者的种籽、肥料、农业工具并给予他们技术上的帮助，保证收购后在工业品和粮食方面对农业生产者优先的和优待的供应，同时在很多场合下，也可预先贷给现金和消费品。因此，预购合同能把城乡间商品联系的形式提到更高的阶段，并为城乡间生产结合打下了坚固的基础。
    采用预购合同的方法收购有下面几种好处：首先，采取预购合同方法收购能够保证国家对农产品的需要，增加国家的后备物资特别是粮食物资，因而就能有力地支援社会主义工业化的建设。一九二九年国家通过预购合同所定购的粮食占春种粮食播种量的百分之五十四，占秋种粮食播种量的百分之四十四，占棉花的全部，甜菜的大部，亚麻的一半。第二，采用预约收购的方法收购，能够加强国家对农业生产的计划领导，使工业和农业发生密切联系，巩固工农联盟。因为它不但能保证农民以高于市价的价格来销售产品，而且也能满足农民对工业品的需求，使农民得到国家的帮助。第三，它能够帮助合作社计划的实现，促进农业集体化的发展。国家按预购合同给予农民的好处，使农村供销合作社迅速地和普遍地发展起来。特别是国家对农业生产合作社和集体农庄给予更优惠的条件，大大刺激了农民向集体化的方向前进，因此，斯大林认为普遍实行预购合同制，成立农业机器站，尽量发展合作社，是劳动农民走向集体化的桥梁。第四，它能够加强社会主义经济的领导，削弱私人资本活动的阵地。因为国家按预购合同所给予农民的优惠，只给贫农和中农。对于富农，国家根本不和他们订立合同，而只给他们规定固定的缴纳任务，并按固定价格收购富农的余粮。因此通过预购合同就能有计划地把小农经济和社会主义经济结合起来，使农民摆脱对私商、富农的依赖。从而扩大了社会主义在农村中的阵地，保证了国家在农产品市场和价格上的领导作用。
    斯大林同志曾这样指出预购合同制底必要性及其意义：“城市和乡村按定货合同制来实行交易的这些新的普遍形式，……正是我们的各个组织在加强对国民经济实行有计划的社会主义的领导方面的一个极大进步”〔二〕。党和政府按照斯大林底指示在实现社会主义工业化时期中坚定不移地广泛发展了预购合同的采购方法，因而取得了粮食战线上的胜利。
    国家粮食采购量在国家工业化时期中是大大增加了，但是，工农业生产的发展，人民收入的迅速增加，劳动人民对食品的需要也猛烈地增长起来了。一九二七年工人消费的小麦粉达到了一九二三年的百分之一百七十，糖达到百分之二百六十五点一，肉类达到了百分之一百八十九点五，牛乳与乳制品达到百分之一百八十五点二，蛋类达到了百分之二百八十七点五。农民的饮食也有类似的改善。在这种情况下商品粮食的增长速度仍赶不上粮食需要的增长速度，粮食缺乏的现象仍然存在。加上当时还有自由市场和投机行为，如果不迅速地对粮食供应实行适当的调剂和分配，工人和技术作物区的农民就买不到粮食，物价就会发生波动，人民生活和国家工业就要受到严重的影响。因此，联共（布）党和苏联政府就在一九二八年末决定实行粮食的定额供应制。正如一九三四年十一月联共（布）中央全会底决议所指出：“购物证供给制在这个时期特别必要，因为虽然自由市场上的价格高出很多，并且在这方面还有投机分子存在，但是工人底供给是按固定的国家价格分配的。只有借着这种制度，国家对后备品加以限制，才能完全保证城市和工业区底供给，才能保证对最重要的中心区和生产中的突击队员的优先供给，并且，才能保证农业原料（棉花、亚麻、大麻、烟草等）底生产者得到固定国家价格的粮食供给，以便提高技术作物并增加工业原料底采购”〔三〕。所以，实行定额供应制是苏联当时必要的贸易形式，它对于社会主义建设，对于国民经济的社会主义改造是具有重大意义的。
    实行定额供应制的目的，就是要使工业基本建设和新建企业开工所需要的新工人能够得到粮食供应；就是最大限度地增加工人阶级的消费量，限制城乡残余剥削阶级的消费量；保证国家计划的完成和刺激劳动生产率的提高。此外，定额供应制的目的也在于杜绝投机商人利用粮食缺乏进行投机活动的机会。
    因此，定额供应制必须按照下列几项来执行：一、保证社会主义建设各部门的需要；二、根据生产指标进行级差供应，保证生产计划的顺利完成；三、为消灭各企业中工人阶级的流动性而斗争；四、刺激劳动生产率的增长。在一九三○年末，为了更好地实行这种制度，苏联又制定了受国家定额供应的城市一览表和居民供应等级表。供应等级分为特等、一等、二等和三等四种。按特等表供应的居民，包括莫斯科、列宁格勒和巴库底工人及其他劳动者，还有顿巴斯、沙河特和卡拉干达底煤矿工人和古兹巴斯底地下工人与顿巴斯底钢铁工人等，他们的定额最高。一等表包括黑色金属业和有色金属业中的工人及其它劳动者。二等表包括火柴、造纸、玻璃、磁器等工业部门的工人。三等表包括前三种表中未被列入的其他工人和劳动者。受国家定额供应的人数和定额的数量，视国家所掌握的粮食资源的多寡而定。
    粮食定额供应制开始仅在个别城市实行。一九二八年以后则普及到全国各城市。一九三○年受国家供应的人数即达二千六百万人，以后则更加增多了。定额供应制度从粮食开始，以后，就逐渐扩展到工业消费品，随着工业的迅速发展和农业生产的增长，有些工业品的定额供应制实行不到二年就取消了，只规定购买的最高限额。粮食的定额供应却一直保持到农业社会主义改造完成的时候（即一九三四年底），才宣布取消。
    负责定额供应的组织，最初仅有消费合作社（那时国营零售贸易尚未发展起来），后来为更好配合生产计划的进行，就在工业企业中组织工人供应处，专门负责供应本企业的职工。公共饮食企业在这个时期中获得了广泛的发展，它成为定额供应制的一个补充来源，对改善工人饮食起了很大的作用。
    定额供应制度对保证城乡劳动人民的需要所起的作用，可从这一时期商品流转的增长来证明。如果把一九二六—一九二七年的商品流转当作一百，那么，一九二八—一九二九年就增到了一百六十点四。而在整个商品流转中，社会主义成分是在相对和绝对地增长着的，资本主义成分则日益下降。在一九二六—一九二九年的时期内私人商业在零售贸易中的比重已由百分之三十二下降到百分之十三点五，在批发贸易中则几乎被完全排挤出去。定额供应制度在加速社会主义向资本主义的斗争过程中起了巨大的作用。
    苏联当时的定额供应制度，是和现在的英国及日本统治中国时期的配给制，有本质上的区别的。前者是在生产迅速发展，劳动人民需要猛烈增加的基础上，为保证城乡劳动人民需要、保证社会主义建设的成功和为消灭资本主义而实行的。后者则是在生产萎缩、劳动人民贫困的基础上，资产阶级进一步掠夺人民血汗的手段。
    苏联社会主义工业化时期解决粮食问题的经验，对于今天我国有巨大的现实意义。四年来，我国的粮食生产已超过战前水平，但我国农业生产的基础还是小农经济，而小农经济的粮食商品率是相当低微的；再加之几年来农民生活的改善，许多余粮户不急切需要出售粮食来进行周转；特别是自由市场的存在和粮商的投机捣乱，更助长了余粮户的贮存观望、等待高价、不愿迅速出卖的心理。而另一方面，随着工业和城市人口的增长，农业经济作物区的扩大，全体人民生活的改善，全国人口的增加，粮食的需要就必然增加起来。因此，在社会主义工业化时期中，我们必须经常注意粮食问题。
    我国解决粮食问题的根本办法，是积极地发展互助合作运动并逐渐把农民引向集体化。但这一办法必须在相当长的期间才能收效，为要解决目前的迫切需要，加强国家对粮食的收购和供应，也就成为我国社会主义工业化时期的重要工作了。苏联在这方面已给我们提供了许多宝贵的经验，我们应当深入地学习这些经验，并恰当地把它运用到实际工作中去。
