Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: According to TASS, the 12th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union continued its session on the 22nd, discussing Shelepin's report on the Central Committee of the Youth League and hearing the report of the Credentials Committee.

Those who spoke in the discussion of Shelepin's report included the heads of the Youth League organizations of various border regions, states, and republics, as well as advanced workers in industry and agriculture. They focused on the work of young people in industrial enterprises and scientific institutions, the tasks of young people in participating in land reclamation, and the development of the collective farm economy, as well as how to organize young people's study and rest.  Leva, a female collective farm member and Hero of Socialist Labor from the Ukrainian Republic, introduced her and her collective farm's production achievements and the methods for promoting advanced experience in the collective farm. Abdykulov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kyrgyz Youth League, spoke about the continuous improvement of the cultural level of the Kyrgyz people. He pointed out that Kyrgyzstan now has ten institutions of higher learning, twenty-seven secondary technical schools, and many seven-year schools.  Kyrgyzstan was very backward during the Tsarist Russian era, but now, in terms of the scale of development of higher education, it has far surpassed some countries in the East and Western Europe.

Romanov, Chairman of the Sports Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Niesmiyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Surkov, First Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union, also spoke at the meeting.

Semichastny, Chairman of the Credentials Committee, made a report on the results of the examination of the delegates' qualifications. He said that the 1,334 delegates participating in this congress were all elected by secret ballot. Among them are advanced workers in industry and agriculture, outstanding young scientific workers, literary and art workers, teachers, students, and cadres of the Youth League organizations. Among the delegates, there are eight Heroes of the Soviet Union and twenty-four Heroes of Socialist Labor, sixteen members of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, eighteen members of the Supreme Soviets of the various allied republics, and more than four hundred members of local Soviets. Semichastny also spoke about the development of the Youth League organizations. He pointed out that since the 11th Congress of the Youth League, more than 9.3 million people have joined the Youth League organizations.

Liu Daosheng, Head of the Chinese Youth Delegation and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a congratulatory speech and presented gifts at the meeting. Then, Bernini, Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Pilavka, Chairman of the Central Council of the Polish Youth Union, and Ducron, General Secretary of the Youth Union of the Republic of France, successively offered congratulations to the Congress. Pilavka and Ducron also presented gifts to the Congress on behalf of their countries' youth. When the foreign guests delivered their congratulatory speeches and presented gifts, the audience applauded warmly.

The Congress continued on the 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: Liu Daosheng, Head of the Chinese Youth Delegation and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a congratulatory speech to the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League at the morning session of the 12th Congress on the 22nd, on behalf of all Chinese Youth League members and youth, and presented gifts.

Liu Daosheng said: The Leninist Young Communist League is a model for youth organizations led by communist and workers' parties in various countries around the world. Advanced youth organizations in various countries learn from you how to be good helpers and reserves for the Communist Party and how to educate youth in the spirit of communism. Your heroic spirit of dedicating yourselves to the great communist construction project, the happy life you have created through labor, and your efforts for peace and friendship between nations, inspire all young fighters who are fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism, and bring hope and strength to millions of young people who are struggling for a better future under imperialist enslavement.

Liu Daosheng then said that the Soviet communist youth movement has a great influence on the Chinese youth movement. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our great people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong, our country's youth movement has always benefited and been encouraged by Lenin and Stalin's teachings on the youth movement and the experience of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League. Now that our motherland is in a historical period of gradually transitioning from a new democratic society to a socialist society, Chinese youth are responding to Comrade Mao Zedong's call to learn from the Soviet Union, study the theories of Lenin and Stalin, learn from the Soviet Union's construction experience, and learn from the Soviet youth's heroic and selfless spirit of labor, to build our motherland into a great socialist country, and in the world's peace, democracy, and socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, to make the greatest efforts to ease international tensions and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Liu Daosheng said that Chinese youth are enthusiastically concerned about the heroic struggle of Soviet youth for the construction of communism, and regard every victory of yours as our common victory. We know that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We are determined, like you, to be vigilant at all times against all the conspiracies and sabotage of imperialism, to build strong iron and steel joint enterprises on the boiling and tense construction sites of our motherland, to go to the towering mountains to explore the resources of our motherland, and to gradually establish collectivized and mechanized agriculture on our vast land. The friendship between our two great nations, developed under the name of Stalin, is a powerful force for defending peace and security in the Far East and the world. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, it is the greatest friendship. The Chinese people and youth cherish this long-tested friendship extremely. When Chinese youth think of today's free and happy life, of the 141 huge projects, and of the spirit of selfless labor of the Soviet experts in China, they cannot help but think of the deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the help from the Soviet Union. Chinese youth express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people and youth for their sincere and selfless help, and promise to continue to work hard to infinitely strengthen the friendship between our two countries' youth.

Liu Daosheng finally warmly congratulated the success of the congress and congratulated the Soviet youth on achieving even more brilliant achievements in the great cause of building communism and defending world peace. His words were met with warm applause from the audience.

After Liu Daosheng finished his speech, he presented the flag of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and a machine made by Chinese young workers to the Soviet youth. When the gifts were presented, the audience applauded warmly.

    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会在二十二日继续开会，讨论谢列平关于青年团中央委员会的报告，并听取了资格审查委员会的报告。

    苏联部长会议体育运动委员会主席罗马诺夫、苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫、苏联作家协会第一书记苏尔科夫等也在会上讲了话。

    代表大会在二十三日继续进行。
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】我国青年代表团团长、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记刘导生在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会二十二日上午会议上，代表全中国青年团员和青年们向大会致祝词并赠礼。
    刘导生说：列宁共产主义青年团是世界各国共产党和工人党所领导的青年组织的模范。各国先进的青年组织从你们那里学习怎样做好共产党的助手和后备军，怎样以共产主义的精神来教育青年。你们献身给伟大的共产主义建设工程的英雄气概，你们用劳动创造出来的幸福生活，你们为各民族之间的和平和友谊所作的努力，鼓舞着一切为和平、民主、社会主义而斗争的年青战士，给千百万在帝国主义奴役下为美好前途而斗争的青年带来了希望和力量。
    刘导生接着说，苏联的共产主义青年运动对中国青年运动有极大的影响。我国的青年运动在中国共产党和我们伟大的人民领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，一直从列宁和斯大林关于青年运动的教导和苏联列宁共产主义青年团的经验中，得到教益和鼓舞。现在我们祖国正处在由新民主主义社会逐步过渡到社会主义社会的历史时期中，中国青年正响应毛泽东同志的学习苏联的号召，学习列宁斯大林的学说，学习苏联的建设经验，学习苏联青年英勇忘我的劳动精神，把我们的祖国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家，并在以苏联为首的世界和平民主和社会主义大家庭中，为缓和国际紧张局势、保卫远东和世界的和平事业作出最大的努力。
    刘导生说，中国青年热情地关怀着苏联青年为建设共产主义而进行的英勇斗争，把你们的每个胜利看作我们共同的胜利。我们知道苏联的今天就是我们的明天。我们决心像你们一样，随时警惕着帝国主义的一切阴谋破坏，在我们祖国沸腾紧张的工地上建设起强大的钢铁联合企业，到崇山峻岭去勘探祖国的富源，在我们广阔的土地上逐步建立起集体化机械化的农业。在斯大林名义下发展起来的我们两国伟大民族的友谊，是保卫远东和世界和平与安全的强大力量。正如毛泽东同志所说的，它是最伟大的友谊。中国人民和青年异常珍贵这种经过长期考验的友谊。中国青年一想到今天自由幸福的生活，想到一百四十一项巨大工程，想到在中国的苏联专家忘我劳动的精神，就不能不想到中苏的深厚友谊和苏联的帮助。中国青年对苏联人民和青年真诚无私的帮助表示衷心感谢，并保证将继续努力使我们两国青年的友谊无限地加强起来。
    刘导生最后热烈祝贺大会成功，祝贺苏联青年在建设共产主义和保卫世界和平的伟大事业中获得更加辉煌的成就。他的话获得了全场热烈的掌声。
    刘导生致词毕，把中国新民主主义青年团团旗和我国青年工人制造的一部机器送给苏联青年。赠礼时，全场热烈鼓掌。
