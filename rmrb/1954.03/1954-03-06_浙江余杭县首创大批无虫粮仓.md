Zhejiang Province's Yu Hang County Creates Batch of Insect-Free Granaries

Of the eighty grain depots under the Yu Hang County People's Government Grain Bureau in Zhejiang Province, fifty-five were declared insect-free last year. After on-the-spot investigations by the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Grain Department, the East China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau, the Central People's Government Ministry of Food, and Soviet grain insect control expert Morozov, it was confirmed that these granaries had indeed eliminated warehouse pests. To commend the Yu Hang County Grain Bureau for pioneering insect-free granaries, the Central People's Government Ministry of Food and the East China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau held an award ceremony in Hangzhou City on January 17, awarding Yu Hang County Grain Bureau certificates and banners.

The equipment conditions of Yu Hang County's grain depots are very poor. The warehouses are mostly converted from ordinary civilian houses, ancestral halls, temples, and guild halls, some of which are buildings from more than a hundred years ago. The reason why fifty-five out of eighty granaries were able to eliminate insect pests is mainly because all grain depot cadres strengthened their sense of responsibility to highly cherish national grain, and resolutely implemented the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than treatment." Their basic experience is: "Thoroughly disinfect the empty warehouse before grain is stored; always keep the warehouse clean inside and out after grain is stored." Before the autumn grain was stored in 1952 and 1953, they thoroughly cleaned and disinfected the warehouses using methods such as "thorough cleaning," "scraping insect nests," "plastering cracks," "chemical disinfection," and "padding chaff and spraying powder"; even the dirtiest places at the bottom of the warehouse were crawled into and cleaned by the custodians. After the grain was stored, they promptly conducted a general survey of grain quality, differentiated between urgent and non-urgent, and carried out processing accordingly. In April 1953, they also carried out a work to eliminate surviving overwintering warehouse insects. In peacetime, they adhered to "diligent cleaning and careful inspection," and regularly maintained cleanliness and hygiene inside and outside the warehouse. In addition, they also paid attention to conducting publicity and education among the masses, mobilizing the masses to assist in grain storage work. Before the autumn grain was stored last year, in order to ensure that the grain entering the warehouse met the standards, the grain depots in the county signed contracts with the relevant township people's governments to ensure the order of grain delivery and the quality of the grain, so as to ensure that bad grain would not leave the village or enter the warehouse. Before the grain was stored, the Chengguan District Grain Depot also organized an inspection team to go deep into the countryside to carry out publicity among the farmers. Some grain depot cadres organized neighborhood grain protection groups. For example, Yu Chuanxiu, the custodian of the Xianlin District Grain Depot, often went to the homes of neighbors to publicize the idea that protecting grain could support national construction and resist US aggression and aid Korea, which improved the enthusiasm of nearby people for protecting national grain. Usually, the neighbors often assisted the grain depot in rat catching and other tasks, becoming Yu Chuanxiu's powerful assistants in storing grain. An old lady named Lang Jingzhi near the eighth sub-warehouse in the district even did not go to see the movies released by the district government. She said: "I am not at ease with this warehouse of grain. It doesn't matter if I don't watch the movie."

Because of the above work, fifty-five of the eighty grain depots of the national grain department in Yu Hang County eliminated insect pests, and at the same time, losses such as mold, spoilage, and rodent gnawing were greatly reduced. No major accidents occurred in 1953.

The fact that Yu Hang County created a large number of insect-free granaries has given grain storage cadres in many regions the confidence to eliminate insect pests and do a good job in grain storage. After cadres from the grain departments of various places in Zhejiang Province visited the insect-free granaries in Yu Hang County, many people criticized the past idea that warehouse insect pests were unavoidable, and set off a wave of learning from Yu Hang County's grain storage experience and striving to create a large number of insect-free granaries. Many grain storage cadres in Shaodong County in Hunan Province and Taiyuan City are also actively learning from Yu Hang County's experience in creating insect-free granaries.

At the award ceremony for the first insect-free granary in Yu Hang County held in Hangzhou City on January 17, Long Yingbei, Deputy Director of the Storage Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Food, called on grain departments in various places to actively promote the advanced experience of Yu Hang County in creating insect-free granaries. He particularly pointed out: The fact that fifty-five insect-free granaries appeared in Yu Hang County's eighty granaries last year proves that regardless of the conditions of the warehouses, as long as we earnestly learn from the advanced experience introduced by Soviet grain insect control experts, resolutely implement the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than treatment," and all cadres give full play to their high sense of responsibility and hard work style, and do a good job of regular cleaning and sanitation, it is possible to create insect-free granaries. He called on grain departments in various places to learn from Yu Hang County Grain Bureau, and hoped that Yu Hang County Grain Bureau would work harder and strive to make all grain depots insect-free granaries.

    浙江余杭县首创大批无虫粮仓
    浙江省余杭县人民政府粮食局所属的八十个粮食仓库中，在去年出现了五十五个无虫粮仓。经过浙江省人民政府粮食厅、华东行政委员会粮食局、中央人民政府粮食部和苏联仓虫防治专家莫若洛夫的实地调查，都证明了这些粮仓确实作到了消除仓库虫害。中央人民政府粮食部和华东行政委员会粮食局为奖励余杭县粮食局首创无虫粮仓，于一月十七日在杭州市举行授奖大会，分别授予余杭县粮食局奖状和锦旗。
    余杭县粮库的设备条件很差，仓房大都是利用普通的民房、祠堂、庙宇、会馆改修的，有的甚至是一百多年前的建筑物。八十个粮仓中所以能有五十五个粮仓消除虫害，主要是因为全体粮库干部加强了高度爱护国家粮食的责任心，坚决贯彻了“防重于治”的粮食保管方针。他们的基本经验是：“粮食入库之前，彻底进行空仓消毒；粮食入库之后，经常保持仓房内外清洁”。在一九五二年和一九五三年秋粮入库以前，他们采用“彻底扫除”、“剔刮虫巢”、“粉刷嵌缝”、“药剂消毒”、“垫糠喷粉”等办法，彻底进行了清仓消毒；连仓底最肮脏的地方，保管员们也爬进去打扫。粮食入库以后，他们便及时普查粮质，分别缓急，进行处理。一九五三年四月，他们还进行了一次扑灭漏网越冬仓虫的工作。在平时，他们坚持“勤打扫，细检查”，经常保持了仓房内外清洁卫生。另外，他们还注意向群众进行宣传教育，动员群众协助进行粮食保管工作。去年秋粮入库以前，该县各粮库为了保证入仓粮食合乎标准，都和有关的乡人民政府签订了合同，保证交粮次序和粮食质量，作到坏粮不出村、不入库。城关区粮库在粮食入库以前，还组织检查小组，深入农村向农民进行了宣传。有些粮库的干部进行了组织四邻护粮小组的工作。如闲林区粮库的保管员喻传秀经常到四邻群众家中宣传保护好粮食可以支援国家建设和抗美援朝的道理，提高了附近群众对保护国家粮食的积极性。平时四邻群众常协助粮库进行捕鼠等工作，成了喻传秀保管粮食的有力助手。该区第八分仓附近有一位郎静芝老太太，连区政府放电影也不去看，她说：“我不放心这一仓粮食，电影不看不要紧。”
    由于作好了上述工作，余杭县国家粮食部门的八十个粮食仓库，就有五十五个仓库消除了虫害，同时霉坏、鼠啮等损失也大为减少，一九五三年全都没有发生大的事故。
    余杭县创造大批无虫粮仓的事实，使许多地区的粮食保管干部树立了消除虫害、作好粮食保管工作的信心。浙江省各地粮食部门的干部到余杭县参观了无虫粮仓以后，许多人批判了过去认为粮仓虫害无法避免的思想，掀起了学习余杭县保管粮食经验，争取创造大批无虫粮仓的热潮。湖南省邵东县和太原市等地许多粮食保管干部也正在积极学习余杭县创造无虫粮仓的经验。
      一月十七日在杭州市举行的余杭县首创无虫粮仓授奖大会上，中央人民政府粮食部仓储局副局长龙映北号召各地粮食部门积极推广余杭县创造无虫粮仓的先进经验。他特别指出：余杭县去年八十个粮仓中出现了五十五个无虫粮仓的事实，证明了不论仓房的条件好坏，只要认真学习苏联仓虫防治专家介绍的先进经验，坚决贯彻“防重于治”的粮食保管方针，全体干部发挥高度的负责精神及艰苦作风，作好了经常的清洁卫生工作，都是可以创造无虫粮仓的。他号召各地粮食部门向余杭县粮食局学习，并希望余杭县粮食局更加努力，争取全部粮仓都成为无虫粮仓。
