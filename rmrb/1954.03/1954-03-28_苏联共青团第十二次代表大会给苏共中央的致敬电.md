The 12th National Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, representing 18 million members of the Communist Youth League and the entire younger generation of the Soviet Union, extends warm Communist Youth League greetings to the beloved Communist Party and its Central Committee!

The young men and women of the Soviet state infinitely love and are infinitely loyal to the Communist Party. Their ideals and aspirations are linked to the Party, and their lifelong happiness and joy are attributed to the Party. The Party nurtures the younger generation of the socialist country every day and every hour. All activities of the Communist Youth League receive constant paternal care from the Communist Party and its Central Committee. The strength and power of the Communist Youth League originate from the leadership of the Party.

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the 12th National Congress of the Communist Youth League has greatly excited the delegates to the Congress and all members of the Communist Youth League. This document outlines a combat program for the Communist Youth League to further improve the education of communist youth builders who are infinitely loyal to the Communist Party and the Soviet motherland. The Congress assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that young men and women members of the Communist Youth League and all Soviet youth will contribute all their energy to realize the Party's wise instructions.

The members of the Communist Youth League and all Soviet youth will more actively participate in the country's economic and cultural construction, and in all aspects of the country's social activities and political life. The Communist Youth League will redouble its efforts to launch a socialist competition among young people to strive for further development of socialist industry, for a rapid surge in all sectors of agriculture, and for producing abundant consumer goods in our country.

The Party gives the Communist Youth League the lofty and important task of conducting communist education for young people. The Communist Youth League will more resolutely help young men and women master the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, consciously implement the invincible doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The Communist Youth League will strive to cultivate the younger generation to become people who love labor, are full of vigor, strong, and brave, who are infinitely loyal to the Party and the Soviet people, who firmly believe in the inevitable victory of communism and can overcome any obstacles on the road to achieving this sacred goal. In the future, the Communist Youth League will strive to enable Soviet youth to firmly grasp knowledge, master the achievements of advanced science and technology, and be good at applying these achievements to all aspects of the national economy and culture. The Communist Youth League organizations will tirelessly care for the physical exercise of young people, and care for their training in preparing to work and defend the beloved motherland.

Faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism, the Communist Youth League will always be at the forefront of democratic youth, striving to strengthen fraternal ties with the youth of the great People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic, and with the younger generations of all countries who are fighting for peace and against the instigators of a new war.

Our Congress is being conducted in an atmosphere of principled criticism and self-criticism. The Congress exposed the shortcomings in the work of the Communist Youth League organizations and their leading bodies, and formulated methods to improve the activities of the Communist Youth League in the future. The Congress pointed out the ways to improve the work of the Leninist Young Pioneers, which plays a great role in the communist education of Soviet children. The Communist Youth League will resolutely eliminate bureaucratic and formalistic leadership styles from the actual work of the Communist Youth League organizations, strive to strengthen close ties with the broad masses of young people, and tirelessly try to meet the growing demands and interests of young men and women.

The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union is holding its 12th National Congress under circumstances where it is more united around the Party and its Central Committee than ever before. The Communist Party is the youth's wise teacher and educator. The Party's words and the Party's cause are above all else for the Communist Youth League. The Congress assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party that, faithful to the immortal Leninist ideology, the Communist Youth League will resolutely and unswervingly follow the Communist Party in the future, acting as its loyal son, its reliable reserve force, and its assistant. The Communist Youth League and Soviet youth will tirelessly help the Party and the Soviet government to strengthen the Soviet state, strengthen the alliance of the working class and collective farmers, and the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and jointly fight for the victory of communism.

Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – the great guiding force and leading force leading the Soviet people to fight for communism!

Long live the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!
The 12th National Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union
