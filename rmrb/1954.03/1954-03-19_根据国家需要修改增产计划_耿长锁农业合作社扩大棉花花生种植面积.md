    Modifying Production Increase Plans According to National Needs
    Geng Changsuo Agricultural Cooperative Expands Cotton and Peanut Planting Area
    The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, has revised its original production increase plan and appropriately expanded the planting area of cotton and peanuts in accordance with the needs of national economic construction.
    In early February of this year, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative formulated a production plan for 1954 based on the specific conditions of the cooperative this year. The cooperative planned to sell 500,000 jin of surplus grain and industrial raw materials to the state after increasing production this year. After the Hebei Provincial People's Government announced the 1954 Grain and Cotton Production Increase Plan, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative immediately convened a cooperative management committee to revise this year's production increase plan in accordance with the state's plan for increasing grain, cotton, and oil crops. The revised plan still focuses on grain production, appropriately expanding the cultivated area of ​​cotton and peanuts, and reducing the cultivated area of ​​sorghum and Chinese yam. Now the cotton fields have been expanded to 330 mu (originally planned 150 mu), and peanuts have been increased to 900 mu (originally planned 700 mu). In order to supply the meat needs of urban people and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, the cooperative stipulates that each production team should raise 20 pigs, more than double the original plan. At the same time, it also plans to lead 30 to 40 farmers outside the cooperative to increase cotton fields by 30 mu and peanuts by 100 mu in accordance with the national plan, and mobilize farmers outside the cooperative to raise more pigs.
    In order to complete the state's 1954 grain and cotton production increase plan, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative wrote letters to five agricultural production cooperatives in Jin County, Caotongyi, and Shen County, Zhen Chunshuang, in Hebei Province, proposing a friendly competition. This patriotic production increase competition has gradually been launched in some advanced agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province. After discussing the production plan of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, the members of the Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jin County (i.e., the cooperative formed by the merger of the Caotongyi Agricultural Production Cooperative and other cooperatives) formulated a cotton and grain production increase plan for 1954. The plan is for the entire cooperative to increase cotton production by 900,000 jin this year to supply the needs of the national textile industry, and replied to Geng Changsuo, expressing their willingness to carry out friendly competition with their cooperative. Inspired by the Geng Changsuo Cooperative, the members of the Liu Wanfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liejiang Village, Wu'an County, Handan Prefecture, formulated a year-round production increase plan and proposed a patriotic production increase competition to all cooperatives in the district. Now the Beilai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Cixian County and the Boyan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wu'an County in the special zone have also launched a competition for harrowing and sending manure.

    根据国家需要修改增产计划
    耿长锁农业合作社扩大棉花花生种植面积
    河北省饶阳县耿长锁农业生产合作社，根据国家经济建设的需要，修订了原来的增产计划，适当扩大了棉花、花生的种植面积。
    今年二月初，耿长锁农业生产合作社根据该社今年的具体条件，曾制定了一九五四年生产计划。该社计划在今年增产后，争取有五十万斤余粮和工业原料卖给国家。河北省人民政府一九五四年粮棉增产计划公布后，耿长锁农业生产合作社立即召开了社务管理委员会，按照国家增产粮棉和油料作物的计划，重新修订了今年的增产计划。修订后的计划仍以生产粮食为主，适当扩大棉田和花生的耕种面积，缩小高粱和山药的种植面积。现在棉田已扩大到三百三十亩（原计划一百五十亩），花生增种到九百亩（原计划七百多亩）。为了供应城市人民的食肉需要，和大量积肥，该社规定每个生产队增养到二十口猪，比原计划增加一倍多。同时，还计划带动社外的三、四十户农民按照国家计划增加棉田三十亩，花生一百亩。并发动社外农民多养猪。
    为了完成国家一九五四年粮棉增产计划，耿长锁农业生产合作社，写信给河北省晋县的曹同义、深县的甄春双等五个农业生产合作社，提出友谊竞赛，现在这个爱国增产竞赛，已在河北省部分先进农业生产合作社中逐步开展。晋县周家庄农业生产合作社（即曹同义农业生产合作社与其他社合并成立的社）社员讨论了耿长锁农业生产合作社的生产计划后，订出了一九五四年的棉粮增产计划，计划全社今年增产九十万斤棉花来供应国家纺织工业的需要，并复信给耿长锁，表示愿意和他们社开展友谊竞赛。邯郸专区武安县列江村刘万富农业生产合作社的社员们，受到耿长锁社的鼓舞，制定了全年增产计划，并向全区各社提出了爱国增产竞赛。现在该专区磁县北来农业生产合作社和武安县伯延村的农业生产合作社，也已开展了耙地送粪竞赛。
