Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 1st. The mechanized and automated thin plate plant project, which began construction in March of last year and is the first of its kind in our country, is entering its final stages and will soon be completed. The leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the managers of Anshan Iron and Steel's various construction companies, and Soviet experts have already studied and arranged the completion plan on the construction site.

　　The construction of the thin plate plant's factory buildings has been basically completed. The roofs and glass windows have been installed, and the frame and pillars have been painted with light blue anti-rust paint. Inside the factory building, the flat ground is covered with purple ceramic tiles and electric trolley tracks. The foundations for dozens of machines and equipment were laid long ago, and the main machines have been installed and will soon be partially tested. Currently, more than a dozen cranes are helping people to dismantle and clean the installed machines. Technicians and workers are using scrapers and gasoline-soaked cloths to carefully clean each gear and ball bearing; and wrapping the cleaned machines with clean white cloth to prevent dust from settling on them.

　　The ongoing installation of electrical equipment plays a decisive role in the current progress of the thin plate plant project. The two large motors that drive the rolling mill have been installed, and the installation of the remaining hundreds of motors is also nearing completion. The factory's nerve center—the various electromagnetic stations and dozens of operating consoles—have all been installed. As soon as the wires manufactured in Shanghai and other places arrive, the wiring can begin.

    鞍钢机械化自动化薄板厂工程快要完工
   【新华社鞍山一日电】去年三月动工的我国第一座机械化自动化薄板厂工程，已进入收尾阶段，不久就要竣工。鞍山钢铁公司负责人、鞍钢各工程公司经理和苏联专家，已经在工地上研究安排了竣工计划。
    薄板厂厂房的建筑工程已经基本上结束。房顶和玻璃窗已经盖好和装好，房架和梁柱上都刷上了浅蓝色的防锈油漆。厂房内平坦的地面上，铺了紫色的缸砖和电动小车铁轨。几十个机器设备的基础早就打好了，主要机器已经安装起来，不久就要局部试车。现在，十多台吊车正帮助人们把安装好的机器拆开清洗。技术人员和工人们，拿着刮刀和浸着汽油的擦布，仔细地擦洗每个齿轮和滚珠轴承；并用洁净的白布，把擦好的机器包裹起来，以免落上灰尘。
    正在进行的电气设备安装工作，对目前薄板厂工程进度起着决定作用。带动轧钢机的两个大马达已经装好，其余的几百个马达的安装也就要完工。工厂的神经枢纽——各个电磁站和几十个操作台都已经装好，只要上海等地承制的电线一到，就可以穿电线了。
