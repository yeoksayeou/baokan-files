    Liu Erkang and No. 5 Well
    By our reporter Jin Yukun
    When the thick coal seam high mining test at No. 5 Well was successful, representatives from various mines came here to visit. When they arrived at the working face, they couldn't help but exclaim with joy: "Good heavens, isn't this like coming to a tall building!"

    Indeed, in people's minds, mines are always short and dark. But now, look, electric lights of two hundred candlepower illuminate the working face, and the rock roof overhead is as smooth as a cement ceiling. Pillars, almost three people high, support it, thick as telephone poles on the street, arranged densely in rows.

    Not long ago, this place was like other medium-thick coal seam mines: short and dark. Production was not only hard on the workers, but nearly half the coal was lost. Now, having learned from Soviet advanced experience and adopted the "inverted table" mining method, the coal is mined right up to the rock roof. If the coal seam is thicker, a coal cutter is used to eat the top half first, then moved down to eat the bottom half, like steps, eating the coal seam completely clean.

    Getting to this point was not easy.

      A year ago, more than ten comrades from Shandong coal mines came to Datong Coal Mine to visit. They walked back and forth in the unusually wide and sparsely pillared underground tunnels of Datong Coal Mine. Liu Erkang, a technician from Datong Mining Bureau, accompanied them.

      "If we had known Datong Coal Mine was losing so much coal, why would Shandong need to build new mines for coal seams only seventy or eighty centimeters thick?" one visitor said regretfully. "It's such a waste for the state to invest so much capital!"

      "That's right, Datong loses more than a meter, more than the coal we get from our new mines," another visitor responded with similar regret. "If we had known this, we might as well have come to pick up coal! As long as the protective coal falls a little by itself, we could pick up fifty or sixty centimeters!"

    In fact, it wasn't just the visitors from Shandong; who wouldn't feel heartache seeing one-half to one-third of the good coal being wasted in Datong? Look, the open voids are full of shiny black coal, almost as high as the roof coal. Looking up, there's the lost coal, with a protective roof coal layer of about one meter four or five thick out of a total coal seam of almost four meters. Looking down, you're stepping on pieces of coal that have fallen from the protective roof coal. Looking left and right, it's all black coal, coal that is being permanently abandoned underground.

    About a month later, Deputy Director and Chief Engineer Zhang Jiying told Liu Erkang that the bureau meeting had decided to put him in charge of carrying out high mining tests on medium-thick coal seams, to thoroughly solve the problem of coal loss. Liu Erkang was very happy with the trust the leadership had placed in him, but this important task was indeed a heavy burden for the young technician.

    Losing coal is a historical problem in coal mines. In recent years, learning from the Soviet "long-arm mining method" has provided solutions for coal seams less than two meters or thicker than four meters. However, the medium-thick coal seams (between two and four meters), remain a problem that has not been solved. Moreover, due to the characteristics of coal mines, geological conditions vary from place to place, and natural conditions often change, making such tests even more difficult. However, in Liu Erkang's view, the more arduous the task, the more glorious his position. Therefore, he went to No. 5 Well of the Second Mine with full confidence to begin his experiment.

    When Liu Erkang arrived at the mine, the mine leaders greeted him lukewarmly, saying: "We all know it's a pity to lose coal, but we just don't have a good solution! Now it's up to you." In their view, the problem of protecting long-term underground resources was something for thousands of years in the future; the conditions weren't right now. Therefore, they didn't offer any solutions, but they raised a lot of difficulties: "What if the roof can't be managed and the rock peels off?" "How can such high pillars be set up?" "What if the production task can't be completed because of the experiment?"

    The beginning was full of obstacles. Coupled with a lack of experience, setbacks were inevitable. The first top cutting attempt often resulted in rock peeling off due to a lack of experience in managing the roof, injuring more than ten people at once. Seeing this, the cadres whose thinking wasn't very open in the first place were even more convinced that "the high mining test is impossible."

    The mine didn't solve the specific problems, but cold words often reached Liu Erkang's ears: "It's a good thing this is a state-owned enterprise; if it were a private enterprise, it would have gone bankrupt long ago. After dragging on for so long, there's still no sign of success?"

    Just when he was in difficulty, the mine bureau's leadership firmly supported him. Liu Erkang reported the situation to the mine bureau, and the bureau decided to have two deputy directors come to lead the effort in person, and said: we will not withdraw until we are successful. After the two deputy directors arrived, they severely criticized the mine's conservative thinking, and the work began to turn around. The workers' morale also rose, and they actively brainstormed to find ways to solve the problem. An old worker suggested shortening the working face, which would reduce the roof pressure, and the problem of insufficient pillar workers would also be solved. The worker's suggestion played a turning point in the entire experiment. The method of shortening the working face opened up new hopes for everyone, and everyone felt that success was approaching.

    At this time, the mine's Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League strengthened their propaganda work among the workers to overcome the fear of some workers that not leaving protective roof coal was unsafe. Liu Erkang also took the opportunity to sit down with the workers and talk about the significance of protecting underground resources.

    Liu Erkang explained to everyone in detail the different attitudes of imperialism, capitalists, and ourselves towards underground resources. He said: The Japanese, in order to "gain profits without investing capital," adopted a residual pillar-style, predatory mining method. Thick protective roof coal is left on top, and the surrounding walls are also coal walls and coal pillars. Such mining sites don't require any maintenance costs, not even a single pillar, and even the preparation work is unnecessary. They mine wherever it's convenient, and abandon it when they encounter obstacles. They eat here and there like mice scurrying around everywhere. The workers describe it as: "Eat a bite, throw a piece away." They don't care about losing coal. If they have a hundred tons of coal, it's a good thing if they can get twenty or thirty tons because their goal is to plunder!

    Capitalists call opening kilns opening "black warehouses," and they mine recklessly everywhere to make their own fortunes. The most profitable is large coal, while broken coal is difficult to transport and doesn't sell for much. Therefore, at the kiln entrance, you can see groups of yellow camels, carrying large blocks of coal like stones on their backs, walking slowly out... Small coal cannot be seen; coal blocks less than twenty catties are all discarded underground, wasting countless underground resources! Of course, capitalists will not feel pain.

    The harm of this kind of coal loss is not only in wasting resources but also in planting a time bomb in the mine. Over time, the discarded coal will oxidize and spontaneously combust, causing a mine-destroying fire. The underground fire that has been emitting a vast smoke at Datong Yantian for more than a hundred years was mostly ignited in this way.

    Now, the mines belong to our people, and we cannot treat the motherland's underground resources in this way. We must know that it takes only ten or dozens of years to grow a tree, but it takes hundreds of millions of years to form a piece of coal. It is difficult to form it, and it is easy to lose it. Moreover, underground resources are limited. Our responsibility is to use it bit by bit as much as possible. We must not only mine more coal to meet the needs of the people but also think about the happiness of our children and grandchildren and make the mine's youth longer. Reducing the loss of underground resources is the glorious responsibility of our coal mining workers.

    Then, he gave everyone an account, saying that the coal loss from just one working face of No. 5 Well amounts to more than 300 tons per day, equivalent to more than 30 million yuan, and how much loss will be caused to the country in one year, and how much loss will be caused to the country by the entire mine! The workers were encouraged when they heard him say this, "Good heavens, it doesn't matter if we don't calculate, but once we calculate, it's terrible. Our high mining is so glorious, and we can increase production and save so much. No matter how difficult it is, we have to make it successful."

    This was the most difficult time at the working face. Autumn rain filled the working face, and the workers worked in the water all day, but they didn't complain at all. The workers said to Liu Erkang: "We can complete it even if it's a little harder!"

    Under the unremitting efforts of the workers, the high mining test was finally successful in October 1953.

    The success of high mining extended the life of No. 5 Well from the original twenty-five years to thirty-five years, adding ten years of youth. Moreover, it became the safest coal mining site, with no minor injuries occurring in four months. Medium-thick coal seams account for 80% of the nation's coal reserves. The success of the high mining test in medium-thick coal seams in Datong Coal Mine provided a direction for the reform of mining methods for medium-thick coal seams.

    Liu Erkang is a technician who graduated from university in 1950. Not long ago, the mine was still a strange place to him, and the "loneliness" and "tedium" of the mine had also troubled him. However, in these short three years, his life has undergone great changes. When he personally saw the mine go from a dilapidated state due to flooding to a vigorous development, when he saw his ideals gradually become a reality, a huge force encouraged him, making him determined to dedicate all his energy and wisdom to the mine. Through years of practical work and the cultivation of the Party, Liu Erkang has grown rapidly and has already assumed the position of Chief of the Coal Mining Section of the Mining Bureau.

    刘尔康和五号井
    本报记者　金雨困
    当五号井中厚煤层采高试验成功后，各矿都派了代表来这里参观，一到掌子面都不由得高兴地叫起来：“好家伙，这不是到大楼上来了吗！”
    可不是吗，在人们印象中，矿井总是矮矮的暗暗的。可是现在，你看，一盏盏二百支光的电灯把掌子面照得通亮，抬起头，头上的岩石顶简直像水泥天花板一样平滑，差不多三人高的柱子一根一根的顶在那里。柱子是那么粗，就像大街上的电线杆一样，一排又一排的密密的排着……。
    不久前这里也和其它中厚煤层的矿井一样：又矮又暗，在里面生产，不光工人受罪，连煤都要丢到将近一半左右。现在因为学了苏联先进经验，采用了“倒台式”采煤方法，把煤采到岩石顶板根，煤层厚些，就用截煤机先吃上面的一半，吃完了再移下来吃下边的一半，像石级一样一级一级的吃，就把煤层吃得全部干干净净了。
    作到现在这样子，可不是容易的事。
      一年前，山东煤矿的十多位同志来大同煤矿参观，他们在大同煤矿所特有的十分宽坦，而且极少支柱的井下巷道里，前前后后地走着。大同矿务局的技术员刘尔康陪着他们。
      “早知大同煤矿丢这么多煤，咱们山东又何必七八十公分厚的煤层还要打新井呢，”一位参观者惋惜地说：“让国家投下这么些资金，真是可惜可惜！”
      “可不是，大同一丢就是一公尺多，丢的比咱们开的新井的煤还多，”另一位参观者同样惋惜地应答着：“早知这样，咱们干脆来捡煤算了！只要让护顶煤自己掉一点下来，怎么也能捡它个五六十公分呀！”
    其实何止山东的参观者呢，谁来到大同看到有二分之一到三分之一的好煤白白丢掉了，能不疼心？你看，空塘里丢得尽是些乌黑闪亮的好煤，差不多堆得有顶煤那么高。往上看，头上是丢煤，近四公尺的煤层，头顶上留着的护顶煤就有一公尺四、五厚。往下看，踩着的尽是护顶煤掉下来的煤块。左右看也尽是乌黑的煤，这些煤就被人们永远扔在地下了。
    大概过了有一个月的光景。副局长兼总工程师张继英告诉刘尔康，局务会议决定要他负责进行中厚煤层的采高试验，彻底解决丢煤问题。刘尔康对领导上给他的信任感到十分高兴，然而这个重要的委托，对年青的技术员来说，确是一付沉重的担子。
    丢煤，这是煤矿中的一个历史问题。这几年来学习了苏联“长臂式采煤法”，在二公尺以下的煤层或四公尺以上的厚煤层，都已有了解决的办法。但在既不太薄又不太厚（二公尺以上四公尺以下）的中厚煤层，还是一个始终没有解决的问题。而且由于煤矿的特点，地质条件都是因地而异，自然情况也常常变化，因此进行这种试验困难就要更多。然而在刘尔康看来；任务越是艰巨，他的岗位也就越为光荣。因此仍是满怀信心地跑到二矿五号井去开始他的试验。
    刘尔康一到矿上，矿上的领导干部就不冷不热地向他说：“丢煤可惜不可惜，咱们也都知道，可就是没有个好办法呀！现在就要看你们的了。”对保护长远的地下资源问题，在他们看来，这是几千年后的事情，现在嘛，条件还不够。因此，办法没有提供什么，困难却提了一大堆：“顶板管不好掉棱皮怎么办？”“这么高的柱子怎么打呀！”“闹试验，生产任务完不成又怎么算呢？”
    事情开头就是障碍重重。加上没有经验，就必然发生挫折。第一次见顶采，因为没有管理顶板的经验，常常掉棱皮，一次就伤了十多个人，原来思想就不很通的干部们，看到这种情形，更认为“采高试验是搞不得”了。
    矿上具体问题不给解决，冷言冷语却常常传到刘尔康的耳边：“这好得是国家企业呀，如果是私人企业不早就给你们赔垮了，拖了这么长的时间，到如今事情还没有个影呢？”
    正在困难的时候，矿务局的领导方面坚决地支持了他。刘尔康把情况向矿务局作了汇报，局里决定两位副局长亲自前来领导，并表示：不胜利不收兵。两位副局长来后，严厉批判了矿上的保守思想，工作开始有了转机。工人的情绪也高涨起来，纷纷动脑筋想办法，解决这个问题。一个老工人提出缩短工作面的建议，工作面一缩短，顶板压力减少了，支柱工不足的问题也不存在了。工人的建议，对整个试验起了一个转折点的作用。缩短工作面的办法为大家打开了新的希望，谁也感到成功的可能是接近了。
    这时井口党、行政、工会、青年团又加强了对工人的宣传工作，来克服某些工人认为不留护顶煤不安全的恐惧心理。刘尔康一有机会，也常和工人们坐在一起谈谈保护地下资源的意义。
    刘尔康向大家详细说明了帝国主义、资本家和我们对待地下资源的不同态度。他说：日本人为了“不下本钱现得利”，采用了什么残柱式的掠夺性的开采方法。顶上留着厚厚的护顶煤，四周也都是煤墙煤柱，这样的采煤场子什么维持费都不用花，连根支柱都不需要，甚至准备工作都不必要。那里顺手就那里开采，遇到阻碍就撒手一扔。东吃西吃就像到处乱窜的老鼠一样，工人形容是：“吃一口，扔一块”。丢煤不丢煤他可不管，有一百吨煤，能拿上二十到三十吨就是好事，因为它的目的就是为了掠夺呀！
    资本家叫开窑为开“黑库”，为了自己的发财就到处胡乱开采，最能赢利的只是大煤，碎煤是又难运又卖不起价钱，因此你在那窑洞口，可以看到一群群黄色的骆驼，背上驮着的全是像石块一样的大煤块，踱着方步慢慢地运送出去……小煤是看不到的，二十斤以下的煤块就被一律抛弃在地下，不知蹧踏了多少地下资源呀！当然资本家是不会感到疼心的。
    这种丢煤的害处还不光在浪费资源，而且为矿山埋下了一颗定时炸弹。天长日久，这些丢下的煤就氧化自燃起来，酿成矿井毁灭性的巨大火灾。大同烟田冒了百余年茫茫大烟的地下火，大部都是这样燃烧起来的。
    现在，矿山已为我们人民所有，我们不能这样对待祖国地下资源，要知道，生成一棵树木，只需十年或数十年，而生成一块煤却需要经过多少万亿年。生成它是困难的，要丢掉它是轻而易举的，而且地下资源有限，我们的责任就在尽可能的使它一点一点为我们所用，我们不仅要多采煤以满足人民的需要，还要为我们子子孙孙的幸福着想，使矿山的青春更长久。减少地下资源的损失，这就是我们采煤工作人员的光荣责任。
    接着他又给大家算了一笔账，光五号井一个掌子面的丢煤，一天就有三百多吨，合三千多万元，一年要给国家造成多少损失，全矿要给国家造成多少损失！工人们听他这么一说，劲头就鼓了起来，“好家伙，要不算账还无所谓，这一算就不得了，咱们搞采高这么光荣，能增产节约这么多，无论怎么困难，也得把它搞成”。
    这时正是工作面最艰苦的时候，秋雨灌满了掌子面，工人成天泡在水里工作，却一点也不嫌苦，工人们向刘尔康说：“再苦一点也能完成！”
    在职工们坚持不懈的努力下，采高试验终于在一九五三年十月获得成功了。
    采高成功使五号井由原来二十五年的寿命延长到三十五年，增加了十年的青春，而且这里成为最安全的采煤场所，四个月以来没有发生轻伤事故。中厚煤层在全国煤的储量中要占到百分之八十。大同煤矿中厚煤层采高试验的成功为中厚煤层采煤方法的改革提供了方向。
    刘尔康是一九五○年才从大学里出来的技术员。不久前，矿山对他还是个陌生的地方，矿山的“寂寞”和“枯燥”也曾经苦恼过他。然而在这短短的三年中，他的生活发生了很大的变化；当他亲自看到矿山从被水淹得破烂不堪的状态中走向蓬勃发展的时候，当他看到自己的理想逐步变为现实的时候，一种巨大的力量鼓舞了他，使他决心把自己全部的精力和智慧献给矿山。几年来实际工作的锻炼和党的培养，刘尔康已迅速成长起来，并已担任了矿务局采煤科科长的职务。
