Xinhua News Agency, March 24th:

    The National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work, which began on the 12th, successfully concluded on the 23rd.

    Through this conference, all representatives gained a clearer understanding of the significant responsibility of cultural and educational work during the country's transition period. They further clarified and unified the idea that cultural and educational undertakings must closely follow and serve the development of economic construction, and serve the general line of our country during the transition period. On this basis, they studied and determined the guiding principles, tasks, and plans for cultural and educational undertakings in 1954.

    The conference was filled with a spirit of unity and a spirit of criticism and self-criticism from beginning to end. Based on the opening speech by Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, and the report by Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director, on the guiding principles and tasks of cultural and educational work in 1954, and in conjunction with the work reports of the central cultural and educational departments, all representatives enthusiastically conducted four small-group discussions and five plenary discussions. They reviewed the implementation of cultural and educational work in 1953, affirmed achievements, criticized shortcomings and errors, exchanged important experiences, and put forward many valuable suggestions for improving the leadership of cultural and educational departments. All representatives unanimously agreed that Director Guo Moruo's opening speech and Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun's report fully implemented the spirit of cultural and educational work serving the general line of our country during the transition period and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee. They unanimously expressed their support and determination to implement the spirit of the report in all practical work.

    During the conference, Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council came to the meeting and gave important instructions on the tasks of cultural and educational work during our country's transition period. All representatives received a profound education, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in carrying out and completing the tasks of cultural and educational work and various cultural and educational plans in the future.

    The conference concluded with a summary by Director Guo Moruo.

    After explaining the achievements of the conference, Director Guo Moruo emphasized that this was the beginning of a victorious advance in this year's cultural and educational work, and that great efforts were still needed to achieve the various tasks set by the conference and complete the plan. He said that although our country's cultural and educational undertakings have achieved great results under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's governments at all levels, and with the efforts of all cultural and educational cadres and the people of the whole country, our cultural and educational undertakings are still far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. To change this situation, it is necessary to make long-term efforts, continue to implement the working policy of "consolidation and rectification, focused development, improved quality, and steady progress," and complete the development tasks on the premise of continuously improving quality, opposing both blind advance and passive conservatism. In implementing this policy, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding, proceed from the actual conditions of the time and place, and follow the plan, rectifying what should be rectified and developing what should be developed, preventing the tendency to divide and execute this policy one-sidedly. In order to better promote cultural and educational undertakings, Director Guo Moruo called on all cultural and educational cadres to strive to enhance the overall thinking and overall perspective, concentrate major efforts to ensure the development of key undertakings in cultural and educational work, complete the tasks stipulated in the national plan, and, while ensuring the development of key undertakings, take good care of other cultural and educational work; in completing various cultural and educational tasks, it is necessary to rely closely on the masses, give play to and reward the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and pay attention to summing up and popularizing successful experiences in practical work.

    Director Guo Moruo emphatically pointed out that the cultural and educational front is a broad ideological front. During the transition period in our country, the task of ideological struggle is not only to further eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, but also to focus on profoundly criticizing bourgeois ideology with the ideas of the working class, and strengthen the education of labor viewpoints, collectivism, patriotism, and internationalism, in order to oppose the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie. He said that the tasks undertaken by our cultural and educational work are arduous, difficult, and glorious. There are still many difficulties in completing the various tasks of cultural and educational work. We must actively think of more ways, practice strict economy, rationally use human and financial resources, tap potential, create advanced experiences, and strive to improve leadership work, study Marxism-Leninism, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strengthen the unity of our ranks. In this way, no difficulty can stop us from moving forward, and any difficulty will be overcome by us.

    Director Guo Moruo finally pointed out that enhancing unity is the prerequisite for our common progress and the basic guarantee for successfully promoting various cultural and educational undertakings. In this conference, everyone enhanced their thinking and strengthened their unity in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, setting a good example for the cultural and educational work teams in various regions and departments. We must promote the spirit of unity of this conference to all parts of the country and to all levels of cultural and educational work departments. Director Guo Moruo called on all cultural and educational cadres to resolutely oppose and prevent complacency, deeply transform their thinking on a conscious basis, continuously overcome shortcomings, correct errors, and gradually raise their socialist consciousness. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, continue to carry forward the fine traditions of cultural and educational workers serving the people and the spirit of hard work, strive to complete the various tasks of cultural and educational work in 1954, and strive to promote the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

    全国文教工作会议圆满结束
    确定今年文教工作方针
    【新华社二十四日讯】全国文教工作会议自十二日举行到二十三日圆满结束。
    经过这次会议，全体代表更加明确地认识了文教工作在国家过渡时期的重大责任，进一步明确和统一了文教事业必须紧紧跟随经济建设的发展而发展，必须为经济建设服务，为我国过渡时期总路线服务的思想，并在这一基础上，研究和确定了一九五四年文教工作方针、任务和文教事业计划。
    这次会议自始至终充满着团结的精神，充满着批评和自我批评的精神。全体代表根据中央人民政府政务院文教委员会郭沫若主任的开幕词、习仲勋副主任关于一九五四年文教工作的方针和任务的报告，结合中央各文教部门的工作报告，热烈地进行了四次小组讨论和五次大会讨论，检查了一九五三年的文教工作执行情况，肯定了工作中的成绩，批判了工作中的缺点和错误，交流了工作中的重要经验，并对改进文教部门的领导工作提出了许多宝贵意见。全体代表一致认为郭沫若主任的开幕词和习仲勋副主任的报告，全部贯彻了文教工作为我国过渡时期总路线服务和中共中央四中全会的精神；一致表示拥护，并决心将报告的精神贯彻到各项实际工作中去。
    在会议进行中间，中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理曾到会对有关我国过渡时期文教工作的任务作了重要指示。全体代表受到了一次深刻的教育，大大增强了在执行和完成今后文教工作任务和各项文教事业计划中的积极性和责任心。
    会议最后由郭沫若主任作总结。
    郭沫若主任在说明这次会议的成就后，着重指出这是今年文教工作胜利前进的开端，要实现会议所规定的各项任务，完成计划，还要作很大的努力。他说，我们国家的文教事业，虽然在中国共产党和各级人民政府的领导下，在全体文教干部和全国人民的努力下，获得了很大的成绩，但是我们的文教事业还远远不能适应国家和人民的要求。要改变这种情况，还要作长期努力，继续贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，在不断提高质量的前提下完成发展的任务，既反对盲目冒进，也反对消极保守。在贯彻这个方针时，要有全面的掌握，从当时当地的实际情况出发，并按照计划，该整顿的整顿，该发展的发展，防止割裂地和片面地执行这个方针的偏向。为了更好地推进文教事业，郭沫若主任要求全体文教工作干部努力增强整体思想和全局观点，集中主要力量保证文教工作中重点事业的发展，完成国家计划规定的任务，并在保证重点事业发展的同时，很好地兼顾其他文教工作；在完成各项文教工作中，要紧紧地依靠群众，发挥和奖励群众的积极性和创造性，注意总结和推广实际工作中的成功的经验。
    郭沫若主任强调指出，文化教育战线是一条广阔的思想战线，在我国过渡时期中思想斗争的任务，不仅要进一步肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，而且特别要着重用工人阶级的思想深刻地批判资产阶级思想，加强劳动观点、集体主义、爱国主义和国际主义的教育，以反对资产阶级的思想影响。他说，我们文教工作所担负的任务是繁重的、艰巨的、也是光荣的，我们在完成文教工作的各项任务中，还有很多困难，我们必须积极地多想办法，厉行精简节约，合理地使用人力财力，发掘潜力，创造先进经验，并努力改进领导工作，学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进经验，加强我们队伍的团结，这样，任何困难都不能阻挡我们前进，任何困难都会被我们克服的。
    郭沫若主任最后指出，增强团结是我们共同进步的前提条件，是胜利推进各项文教事业的基本保证。在这次会议中，大家都以批评和自我批评的精神，提高了思想，增强了团结，给各地区、各部门文教工作队伍作出了良好的榜样。我们必须将这次会议的团结精神，推广到全国各地方去，推广到各级文教工作部门去。郭沫若主任号召全体文教工作干部要坚决反对和防止骄傲自满的情绪，在自觉的基础上，深入思想改造，不断地克服缺点，纠正错误，逐步地提高社会主义觉悟，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，继续发扬文教工作者为人民服务的优良传统和艰苦奋斗的作风，努力完成一九五四年文教工作的各项任务，为推进国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业而奋斗。
