In order to lead farmers in improving agricultural production and expand the area of mechanized irrigation, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government is investing 20 billion yuan this year to purchase 180 water bailer pumps. It will focus on establishing more than a dozen state-owned water bailer pumping stations in the Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Songjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, and Yancheng regions. There are currently nearly 4,000 public and private water bailer pumps in the province, irrigating over 3 million mu of farmland, which have played a significant role in drought resistance and flood drainage over the years. The Furong Embankment in Wuxi is low-lying and prone to waterlogging. After the People's Government established a state-owned water bailer pumping station here in 1950, the 8,600+ mu of rice paddies in the Furong Embankment area have been watered and drained in a timely manner, and the yield has increased from 300-400 jin per mu to around 600 jin. Last year, the embankment increased rice production by a total of more than 2.93 million jin, and also expanded the wheat planting area by more than 5,000 mu. Last year, Miaoqian Village in Liyang County borrowed a water bailer pump from the government. In the absence of rain for 63 days, it was still able to guarantee the irrigation of 934 mu of rice paddies, increasing the yield by 100 jin per mu compared to a normal year. As the farmers of Furong Embankment in Wuxi County said: "With a water bailer pump, we have full granaries every year."

    江苏今年将建立一批国营戽水机站
    江苏省人民政府为了领导农民提高农业生产，扩大机械灌溉面积，今年投资二百亿元添置一百八十台戽水机，在镇江、苏州、松江、扬州、南通、盐城等专区，重点建立十几处国营戽水机站，该省现有公、私营戽水机近四千台，灌溉着三百余万亩农田，在历年抗旱、排涝中都起了很大作用。无锡芙蓉圩地势低洼，连年内涝，一九五○年人民政府在这里建立了国营戽水机站以后，芙蓉圩一带八千六百多亩水稻田浇地、排水都及时，产量已由每亩三、四百斤增加到六百斤左右。去年该圩增产稻子总计有二百九十三万多斤，还扩大了小麦种植面积五千多亩。溧阳县庙前村去年向政府贷到戽水机一台，在六十三天不下雨的情况下，仍能保证九百三十四亩水稻田的灌溉，每亩比一般年成增产一百斤。正如无锡县芙蓉圩农民说：“有了戽水机，年年谷满仓。”
