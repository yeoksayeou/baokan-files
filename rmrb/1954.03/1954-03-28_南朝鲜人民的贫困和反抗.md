According to the Pyongyang "New Korea" magazine in January, the number of unemployed and semi-employed people in South Korea has reached more than 10 million. Even those employed cannot maintain their minimum living standards due to rising prices. According to the magazine's statistics, if the price index in South Korea in 1947 was 100, it has recently reached 8,030. However, the wages of South Korean workers are significantly decreasing. For example, if the wage index for workers in 1947 was 100, it has now fallen to 27. Even the South Korean dockworkers, who have always been considered to have the "highest wages," cannot even afford two bowls of soup and rice with their wages for twelve hours of work per day.

In recent months, workers in coal mines such as Samcheok and Hwasun, and dockworkers in Busan and Gunsan, have continuously launched strikes to demand wage increases. The brutal exploitation by the US-Syngman Rhee gang has made it unbearable for South Korean workers.

Employee Strike
According to a March 8th dispatch from Seoul by the Associated Press: Employees of the so-called "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency" in South Korea extended their strike for another 48 hours on March 8th to demand wage increases. An internal bulletin from the United Press International on March 9th stated that since the value of the won against the dollar depreciated from 60 to 1 to 180 to 1 last December, these employees' wages have not increased. Therefore, their income has been deprived of two-thirds for no reason, and they have now unanimously demanded a 300 percent increase in wages.

In fact, the black market exchange rate of the counterfeit currency (won) against the dollar in Seoul has recently fallen to 300 to 1. These employees' demands for wage increases are clearly lagging behind inflation.

Syngman Rhee's Troops Morale is Low and Desertion is Increasing Daily
When Eisenhower "visited" South Korea in December 1952, he boasted that he would expand Syngman Rhee's troops to two million. However, more than a year later, the US and Syngman Rhee bandits have only managed to cobble together about 500,000 troops through forced conscription and indiscriminate arrests in South Korea. Moreover, the morale of these bandit officers and soldiers is generally low, and desertion is increasing daily. Last December, the Syngman Rhee bandit leader set up a so-called "amnesty period for deserters," deceiving the fleeing bandit soldiers that those who "surrendered" during the "amnesty period" would not be prosecuted and would be reinstated to their original rank. Obviously, this trick did not work. At the same time, the Syngman Rhee gang dispatched a large number of puppet police and secret agents to search everywhere, and tortured and arrested the families of "deserters." Recently, the bandits have also sent a large number of secret agents mixed into the puppet army to monitor the soldiers' actions. Now, the soldiers of Syngman Rhee's puppet army do not even dare to talk to each other. No wonder the "Indian Times" reported that South Korea has now become "a country full of political police, where everyone suspects others of being government agents."

"Farewell Money to the Underworld" Increases
In order to make up for their financial deficit, the Syngman Rhee gang recently decided to issue 7 billion won of so-called "national debt" and forcibly promote it among the South Korean people. In addition to this open plunder, the bandits are constantly increasing various exorbitant taxes. According to the already-reduced figures of the "Public Security Bureau" of the Syngman Rhee puppet government's "Ministry of Internal Affairs," there are as many as 280 kinds of taxes and levies in South Korea. In South Korea today, not only are prices soaring everywhere, but even the usage fees for cemeteries and cremation fees have doubled. The reactionary newspaper "Chosun Ilbo" in Seoul also had to admit: "To live, one must endure the endless soaring prices and exorbitant taxes; to die, one must also worry about the doubled farewell money to the underworld."

The result of the Syngman Rhee gang's implementation of American war policies has made it impossible for the South Korean people to live or die.

### 南朝鲜人民的贫困和反抗

    南朝鲜人民的贫困和反抗
    据一月份平壤“新朝鲜”杂志记载，目前南朝鲜失业与半失业人数，已达到一千多万人，就是在业的劳动人民，因为物价不断上涨，现在已不能维持自己的最低生活。据该杂志统计，如果以一九四七年南朝鲜的物价指数是一百，最近便达到八千零三十，但南朝鲜工人的工资，却在显著地降低，如一九四七年工人的工资指数是一百，现在已下降到二十七。一向被认为“工资最高”的南朝鲜码头工人，现在他们每天劳动十二个小时所得的工资，连两碗汤饭都买不到。
    最近几个月来，在南朝鲜的三陟、和顺等煤矿的工人和釜山、群山等地的码头工人，为了要求增加工资，不断地掀起罢工运动。美李匪帮的这种残酷的榨取，已使得南朝鲜的工人们忍无可忍了。
      雇员罢工
    据美联社汉城三月八日电讯报道：南朝鲜的所谓“联合国朝鲜复兴局”的雇员们，为了要求增加工资，在三月八日又把罢工的时间延长了四十八小时。美国国际新闻社三月九日的内部通报说，自从去年十二月，圆币对美元的比值从六十比一贬到一百八十比一后，这些雇员们的工资并未增加，因此，他们的收入无缘无故被剥夺了三分之二，现在，他们已一致提出提高工资百分之三百的要求。
    其实，最近汉城的伪币（圆）对美元黑市的比价，已降到一比三百了。这些雇员的增薪要求，显然又落在通货膨胀的后面。
      李伪军士气低落，逃亡现象日增
    一九五二年十二月，艾森豪威尔“访问”南朝鲜的时候，曾扬言要把李伪军扩充到二百万人，但是，事隔一年多了，美李匪徒们在南朝鲜强征乱抓的结果，只不过拼凑了五十万人左右，而且在这些匪军官兵中，士气普遍低落，逃亡的现象天天增加。去年十二月，李承晚匪首曾布置了一个所谓
  “逃兵自首期”的骗局，欺骗逃亡的匪军们说，凡在“自首期”内“自首”的人，不加追究，一律按原级服役。显然，这个骗术并没有收到效果。同时，李匪帮又出动了大批伪警察、特务，到处搜索，并拷打和逮捕“逃兵”的家属。最近，匪徒们又派遣了大批特务混在伪军中，监视士兵们的行动，现在，李伪军的士兵们，彼此连话也不敢谈。难怪“印度时报”报道，南朝鲜现在已变成了“一个到处都是政治警察的国家，每个人都怀疑别人是政府的特务”。
      “黄泉旅费”涨价
    李承晚匪帮为了弥补他们财政上的赤字，最近，已决定发行七十亿圆的所谓“国债”，在南朝鲜人民中强加推销。除了这个公开的掠夺以外，匪徒们还在不断地增加各种苛捐杂税。据李伪政府“内务部治安局”已经缩小了的数字统计，南朝鲜的税、捐已达到二百八十种之多。目前的南朝鲜，不仅各地物价暴涨，就是连公墓的使用费和火葬费也提高了一倍。汉城的反动报纸“朝鲜日报”也不得不承认：“想活下去，就得忍受无止境的物价暴涨和苛捐杂税的折磨；想死，也得为提高了一倍的黄泉旅费而焦虑。”
    李承晚匪帮执行美国战争政策的结果，已使南朝鲜人民求生不能，求死不得了。
