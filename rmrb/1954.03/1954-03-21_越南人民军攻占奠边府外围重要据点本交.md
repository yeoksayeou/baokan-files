Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 19th, the Vietnamese People's Army captured the important outpost of Bon Giao, outside Dien Bien Phu, on the 17th, and forced two defending companies to surrender with their weapons. Bon Giao is one of the three outposts in the northern military sector of Dien Bien Phu, protecting the northwest side of Dien Bien Phu. It is located on a high mountain about two kilometers from the main military sector's airport. After the People's Army successively removed the enemy outposts of Xin Lan and Doc Lap Mountain (formerly translated as Xinglong and Doc Lap Heights) from March 13th to the morning of the 15th, it tightly surrounded the Bon Giao outpost. Facing this situation, the morale of the puppet army's Third Thai Battalion, which was defending the outpost, rapidly declined.

On the morning of March 17th, at 9 o'clock, the People's Army's heavy artillery began to bombard Bon Giao fiercely. Many defenders, realizing that they would be sacrificing themselves in vain, fled from the outpost and surrendered to the People's Army. The French commander attempted to gather the remnants and retreat to Muong Thanh. At the same time, the French headquarters in Muong Thanh hurriedly sent a battalion of troops, supported by six tanks, to provide assistance. However, the People's Army opened fire on the enemy reinforcement troops, killing some of the enemy, and the remaining enemies were driven back to their lair. At this time, two hundred puppet soldiers in Bon Giao mutinied. They carried white flags and, with their weapons, walked towards the People's Army base. Then, the People's Army occupied the enemy outpost of Bon Giao. At this point, the entire northern military sector of the French army in Dien Bien Phu fell into the hands of the People's Army.

In addition, on March 13th, one hundred and thirty-nine puppet soldiers of the puppet army's 703rd Battalion stationed in Nam Dinh province also surrendered to the People's Army with weapons and ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 19th, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces behind enemy lines in North Vietnam attacked the enemy's transportation lines and military outposts everywhere, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

On the evening of March 15th, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces intercepted a convoy of enemy transport ships on the Thai Binh River in Pho Lai, Bac Giang Province, destroying a large gunboat and three motorboats full of enemy troops. According to preliminary estimates, more than 100 European and African enemy soldiers were killed. On the same day, the People's Armed Forces intercepted a convoy of enemy transport ships on the Red River in Li Ren County, Ha Nam Province, sinking one motorboat, and two other gunboats caught fire after being hit.

On the 14th, the People's Armed Forces attacked a convoy of enemy transport ships on the Dai River six kilometers southeast of Phat Diem, Ninh Binh Province. As a result, five motorboats were sunk or burned; enemy corpses filled one motorboat and three small boats.

On March 11th, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces removed the French army outpost of Hoai Bao Cang, located seven kilometers southwest of the capital of Bac Ninh Province on Highway No. 1, killing and wounding 89 enemy soldiers.

On the 7th, the People's Armed Forces attacked the enemy outpost of Ca Vy, located on the highway connecting Nam Dinh and Ninh Binh, killing and capturing 80 enemy soldiers.

    越南人民军攻占奠边府外围重要据点本交
   【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南人民军于十七日攻占奠边府外围的重要据点本交，并迫使守敌两连携械投诚。本交是法军在奠边府北部的军分区的三个据点之一，掩护着奠边府的西北面，位于距主要军分区的机场大约二公里的一座高山上。人民军在从三月十三日到十五日晨接连拔除了敌军据点新兰和独立山（前译兴垄和独立高地）以后，就紧紧地包围了本交据点。面对着这种情况，据守这个据点的伪军第三泰族营士气迅速下降了。
    三月十七日上午九点，人民军的重炮开始向本交猛轰。许多守敌由于认识到他们将无谓牺牲，纷纷从据点逃出来向人民军投降。法军指挥官企图收拾残军向芒清撤退。同时，芒清的法军司令部也匆忙地派出了一营人在六辆坦克的配合下前来接应。但是人民军向敌军增援部队开火，击毙敌军一部，余敌被赶回老巢。这时，本交有二百名伪军哗变了，他们手持白旗，带着武器，向人民军的基地走来。接着，人民军占领了敌军据点本交；至此，法军在奠边府的整个北部的军分区全落入人民军手中。
    另外，三月十三日，驻在南定省的伪军第七零三营的一百三十九名伪军，也携带武器和弹药向人民军投诚。
     【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：在北越敌后的越南人民武装到处袭击敌人的运输线和军事据点，使敌人遭受重大损失。
    三月十五日晚，越南人民武装在北江省谱籁截击太平河上的一队敌军运输船队，击毁满载敌军的大型炮艇一艘和汽艇三艘。据初步估计，共击毙欧非籍敌军一百多名。同日，人民武装在河南省里仁县截击红河上的一队敌军运输船队，击沉汽艇一艘，另有两艘炮艇中弹起火。
    十四日，人民武装在宁平省发艳东南六公里处袭击带河上的敌军运输船队。结果，五艘汽艇被击沉或焚毁；敌军尸体装满了一艘汽艇和三只小船。
    三月十一日越南人民武装拔除了位于北宁省省会西南七公里第一号公路上的法军据点淮保仓，毙、伤敌军八十九名。
    七日，人民武装进攻位于连接南定和宁平的公路上的敌军据点歌威，毙、俘敌军八十名。
