    Naxi County's Bali Village Achieves Bumper Harvest Through Joint Group Mutual Aid

    For two years, the mutual aid groups in Bali Village, Daqiao Township, Naxi County, Sichuan Province, have practiced joint group mutual aid, overcoming difficulties that individual mutual aid groups could not overcome, and achieving increased production year after year.

    In the spring plowing season of 1952, Bali Village organized seven mutual aid groups. Soon after their organization, they encountered a severe spring drought. At that time, members of the Xie Haizhou mutual aid group, both men and women, went out together to take turns operating water wheels to fight the drought. They persisted for seven days and seven nights, ensuring that the entire group was able to transplant all of their rice seedlings. The paddy fields of the Shen Shaoqin mutual aid group were located on high ground and the water source was far away, requiring eight water wheels to bring water into the fields. They did not have these water wheels and could not pump water to fight the drought. The Fei Keming mutual aid group also faced the problem that the water source was too far away and they lacked manpower. They could not balance pumping water with harvesting the early spring crops and were overwhelmed with work. The village cadres, upon discovering this situation, mobilized the mutual aid groups to hold democratic consultations and, based on the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, they adjusted their labor and farm tools to practice joint group mutual aid. As a result, the Shen Shaoqin and Fei Keming groups were able to solve the difficulties of insufficient water wheels and lack of labor, and were able to transplant their rice seedlings by rushing to get water. Through collective drought resistance, the farmers saw the superiority of being organized. In addition to the further consolidation of the existing mutual aid groups, four new mutual aid groups were established. These groups generally achieved bumper harvests in the autumn, with yields in general high-yield fields exceeding six hundred catties. During the autumn plowing season, some mutual aid groups had manpower but no oxen power, while others had oxen power but lacked manpower, making it impossible to seize the time for plowing. The village cadres promptly convened a joint meeting of mutual aid group leaders to mobilize the groups to continue practicing joint group mutual aid. After the meeting, the groups voluntarily combined to overcome difficulties. For example, the Ma Shulin mutual aid group had three oxen, the Wang Genzhong mutual aid group had two oxen, and the Ye Yucheng mutual aid group had only half an ox. The three mutual aid groups joined together, solving the problem of insufficient oxen power. After the Li Hongxing, Tong Shuyun, and Shen Shaoqin mutual aid groups united, they had more than twenty major laborers and eight oxen, also solving the problem of lacking both labor and oxen. Due to the implementation of joint group mutual aid, the dry land of all 114 households in the village, including individual households, was completely plowed within half a month. Everyone benefited practically from the joint group mutual aid in 1952. In the spring plowing production and autumn harvest of 1953, they continued to carry out joint group mutual aid, solving the difficulties in developing production. The whole village generally achieved increased production, with an average increase of 40% compared to 1952.

    After receiving education on the general line, the farmers in Bali Village further recognized the correctness of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Currently, two groups are piloting agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of joint group mutual aid. In addition, three new mutual aid groups have been added. They are jointly carrying out spring production work such as plowing paddy fields, weeding the spring crops, and accumulating fertilizer.

    纳溪县八里村实行联组互助获得丰收
    四川省纳溪县大桥乡八里村互助组两年来实行联组互助，克服了单个互助组所不能克服的困难，连年获得增产。
    八里村在一九五二年春耕时组织了七个互助组，组织起来不久就遇着严重的春旱。当时，谢海洲互助组男女组员一齐出动轮班车水抗旱，坚持七天七夜，保证了全组满栽满插。沈绍钦互助组的水田地势很高，水源较远，需要八架水车才能车水进田，他们没有这些水车，就无法车水抗旱。费克明互助组也因水源远，人力不足，车水和收小春不能兼顾，活路忙不过来。乡村干部发现这一情况，便动员各互助组民主协商，根据等价互利的原则，互相调剂劳力和农具，实行联组互助。这样一来，沈绍钦和费克明等组也都顺利地解决了水车不够和缺少劳动力的困难，抢水把秧栽满。通过集体抗旱，农民看到了组织起来的优越性，除原有互助组得到进一步巩固外，并新成立了四个互助组。这些组秋收时普遍获得丰收，一般丰产田产量都在六百斤以上。秋耕时，有的互助组有人力没有牛力，有的有牛力但缺乏人力，无法抓紧时间进行耕翻。村干部又及时召开互助组长联席会议，发动各组继续实行联组互助。会后，各组又都自愿结合，克服困难。如马树林互助组有三头牛，汪根仲互助组有两头牛，叶玉成互助组只有半头牛，三个互助组一联合，便解决了牛力缺乏的问题。李洪兴、童树云、沈绍钦三个互助组联合起来以后，共有二十多个主要劳动力、八头耕牛，也解决了缺劳力缺耕牛的问题。由于实行联组互助，全村连单干户在内一百一十四户的坂田在半个月内完全犁完。大家从一九五二年联组互助中得到了实际好处，一九五三年春耕生产和秋收时又都进行联组互助，解决了发展生产中的困难，全村普遍获得增产，平均比一九五二年增产了百分之四十。
    八里村农民经过总路线教育后，更进一步认识到走互助合作道路的正确性，目前已有两个组在联组互助的基础上试办农业生产合作社，此外，又新添了三个互助组。他们正在联合进行翻犁水田和薅小春、积肥等春季生产工作。
