The People's Daily Reporter An Gang reports:

According to the situation in Shenyang and Harbin, the propaganda of the general line has had a profound impact on the majority of workers in state-owned factories and mines. Factories and mines that have undergone propaganda have seen a surge of production innovation everywhere. The slogan proposed by the workers of Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is:
"We must increase the number of vehicles so that the nation's transportation industry can catch up with the demands of industrialization. We want to be the locomotives of socialist construction." Under this slogan, the frame group of the factory earnestly implemented the suggestion of the Soviet expert on "cylinder alignment," transforming from a weak link into an advanced group, completing the production plan ahead of schedule, and playing a decisive role in ensuring the completion of locomotive overhaul tasks. The slogan proposed by the third workshop of Harbin Tool Factory is: "'Broaches' are precision tools used to manufacture machine tools, and machine tools are the foundation of industrialization. Producing more broaches, reducing tolerances, and ensuring quality will speed up national industrialization." Jin Tie, a fitter in the factory, created the "multi-tool, multi-clamp" method, increasing production efficiency by thirty-six times. The education of the general line has inspired workers' enthusiasm for improving manual operation methods. Sun Lianjun, a packaging worker at the Cement Factory, said: "How can I get to socialism with this slow printing work? I have to invent a machine." Now, he has created a machine to replace manual printing. The education of the general line has established the overall concept of completing tasks among the employees. In the past, the allocation of manpower in the Songjiang Machinery Factory was often hindered. This time, when strong technical workers were transferred, the workers said: "No matter whose work it is, as long as it is to complete the country's task, we have no objection." The education of the general line has also encouraged workers to learn from the advanced. Zuo Wenwen, a worker at the Tool Factory, said: "In the past, I always felt that there was no difference between being backward and being advanced, both relying on work to eat. After hearing the general line, I realized that this idea was wrong. If everyone were like Wang Chonglun, completing four years' worth of work in one year, wouldn't the good days of socialism come quickly?"

From these facts, we can see an important issue: if the enterprise Party organizations are good at combining the general line with the daily production labor of the employees to carry out political education, they can guide people's thoughts and actions to move forward constantly. However, some factories are not doing this. They use sudden methods to publicize the general line in isolation. After publicizing for a while, they are satisfied with counting the number of people who have received the general line propaganda, without studying the specific degree of education people have received and the ideological problems that remain to be solved. They have not well integrated the general line propaganda with the discussion and implementation of production and financial plans. The reason for this situation is mainly because some comrades believe that "propaganda work is anyway a rush to complete tasks. Whatever work comes, we are the first to take the lead." Thus, a so-called rush-to-complete-tasks propaganda method has emerged. At the beginning of the general line propaganda, slogans and blackboards in these places were filled with the words "general line," and large and small meetings all promoted it for a while. When the masses demanded improvement and needed to combine with reality to improve the propaganda level of the general line, the propaganda work fell behind the masses. The situation in advanced factories is the opposite. General line propaganda has become a political task for the entire Party under the leadership of the Party committee. They have adopted different propaganda forms around the general slogan, and proposed practical action slogans according to different objects (old workers, young workers, technical personnel, etc.). They combine the characteristics of their enterprises, the current production tasks, and the ideological situation of the employees, focusing on explaining the relationship between each person's labor and the realization of national socialist industrialization, and pointing out the direction of each person's efforts. The propaganda in these factories has achieved good results and has become a driving force for improving the ideological awareness of employees and promoting production. The propaganda work itself has also been greatly strengthened with the improvement of the masses' thinking.

To make the general line propaganda deep and lasting, it must be closely combined with the daily labor and life of the employees.

During the Sino-Soviet co-management period of the China Changchun Railway, Comrade Iririn, the Soviet chief engineer of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, checked the attendance of each workshop at every daily production meeting. He personally grasped the attendance figures every day, regularly analyzed the value created by each production worker, and immediately inquired about absenteeism, investigated the reasons, and took measures. Soviet experts require political workers to politically mobilize each worker to accurately calculate every minute of working time, so that every minute creates more wealth for the country. Soviet experts believe that this is the most important political work of all enterprise departments. To deeply promote the general line, we should learn this spirit, establish the socialist labor concept of the employees from their daily lives, so that the thinking of every worker and technician can conform to the needs of socialist industrialization. In the first half of last year, the attendance rate of workers in Shenyang Mechanical Seven Factory was very low. The total number of absences in the first quarter was 15,472 working days, which is equivalent to 1,000 workers not producing for half a year. As a result of lax labor discipline, accidents occurred continuously. Four major accidents and two hundred and six general accidents occurred in the first quarter. What caused this? According to the comrades of the factory, the main reason is that the education of new workers on the communist labor concept and labor discipline was not done well enough. They only talked about general principles, did not understand the workers' thoughts and lives, and the content of propaganda was empty and generalized, unable to touch people's hearts. This is a very important lesson. Is it that there are no facts that can "touch people's hearts" in Mechanical Seven Factory? Obviously not. I have asked some old workers. The old workers generally have good labor concepts. They have rich knowledge and feelings of class struggle. An old worker at Mechanical Seven Factory said: "Every day when I enter and leave the factory gate, I think of the scene when the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang searched the workers' pockets. In the past, I was afraid and angry when I approached the gate. Now, when I see the gate, I think of myself as the master. Our labor is for creating a happy life for our children and grandchildren for the first time. In the past, after finishing a job, I would look at the time, wishing to get off work. Now, I always feel that I have not done enough, and the sun is setting. Labor has become our greatest happiness." Our propagandists should look for these simple and valuable materials from life, raise them to the level of communist principles, and educate the vast number of workers, which can touch people's hearts.

Let's look at the ideological characteristics of the young workers who make up 70% of the Mechanical Seven Factory. The new workers come from all directions, bringing different ideological influences and characteristics into the factory. The comrades of Mechanical Seven Factory said: "Our factory has three generations of workers in the same family, grandfather, father, and son are all together. These young people are the easiest to accept class education. The family rules of the old workers are: 'Don't you dare to embarrass me.' It is not allowed to be late, leave early, or play tricks. The young people also want to compete with their fathers. They are energetic in production and are backbones in politics. If someone wants to be mischievous, we tell them: 'Ask your father, is this how it should be?' 'Have you forgotten your roots?' They will quickly change their attitude.

"The young people who come from the countryside have political enthusiasm. They still remember the struggle of the Party leading the peasants to carry out land reform in their minds. However, their views on cities and factories are somewhat incorrect. Some of them are unwilling to carry hoes and think that the work in the factory is 'easy' and comfortable. When they come to the factory, they find that the actual situation is different from what they thought. The factory is now manufacturing new products, and the requirements for workpieces are becoming more and more strict. If the workers are not focused, defective products will come out, which is much more difficult than carrying a hoe. What about life? The factory is expanding day by day, but the dormitory houses cannot be prepared all at once. Dozens of people are crowded in the warehouse to sleep, and they have to queue up for meals. These are the difficulties on the road to national industrialization! We have not explained to these young people the history of the factory's development and the relationship between the factory's production and the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. We have not let the old workers give them class education lessons. If ideological work is not done enough, problems will arise. Some people lie in bed when they encounter difficulties. This reduces the attendance rate.

"Some workers recruited from urban citizens, some of them are small traders, some have attended elementary or junior elementary school for a few years, and have not been exposed to production. Some of these people are very good, but many people have different ideas. If they are not satisfied, they want to 'jump to another factory!' 'Learn a skill and fly far away.' Some even have 'small boss' thinking, and some work in the factory while taking on jobs outside. When they are tired from working outside, they run to the factory to doze off. The influence of bourgeois ideology has ruined some of these workers. The study of the general line can open their eyes."

Our propagandists often neglect to conduct class analysis of the propaganda objects, so when carrying out communist education, they do not distinguish between the objects, which is one of the reasons why the propaganda cannot touch people's hearts.

Another reason is that the propagandists cannot always study those daily, even very small, life phenomena as propaganda and mobilization themes, and guide people's thinking to the communist ideological level through various specific facts.

How can we combine daily phenomena with socialist industrialization education?

I have asked some factory leaders familiar with production business to express their opinions. They believe: "The most common but the most important thing is to educate employees to correctly use every work hour in accordance with the spirit of the general line. What is a work hour? A work hour is the number of revolutions of the machine, is the record of people controlling the machine to speed up its rotation for industrialization, and is the material wealth produced by the enterprise for the country every day and every hour. To achieve socialist industrialization, we must mobilize employees to cherish and correctly use every work hour." During the Sino-Soviet co-management period of the China Changchun Railway, Soviet experts at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory paid great attention to telling workers the production value that a work hour should create according to the national plan, so that they understood the correct relationship between each person's daily labor and the national interests, and struggled to overfulfill the national task. Soviet experts used calculation methods to explain to the workers the total quarterly product and value according to the annual plan, and then calculated the total daily output based on the actual working days. At the same time, labor productivity was compiled according to the national plan, so that every worker understood the production volume calculated in currency produced in a certain period of time (one year, one month, one working day, one working hour), or the working days or work hours spent on manufacturing various products. The Party organization's political work requires workers to do 480 minutes of work in eight hours according to the actual calculation, and correctly use every minute to increase production for the country. The Party's political work pointed out to the workers: only those who cherish every minute and create higher production value in every minute are pioneers on the road to socialism.

I also consulted some worker comrades. A worker in the processing workshop told me: "You say what is industrialization to us workers?" He paused for a while and said: "It's nothing else, it's just skillfully using the 'knife.' We have to use our brains and use the knife to participate in the great work of creating socialism." As long as you pay attention, you can often see some phenomena in some mechanical factories or workshops: during the lunch break after eating, some workers are not resting, but are thinking, holding chalk and scribbling on the ground. It turns out that they are finding angles according to the shape of the lathe and the shape of the workpiece, so that the knife can turn faster. The workers said: "We try everything to sharpen and use the knife well. The first time the knife cuts one point, the second time it cuts one and a half points, and the third time it cuts two points. After gaining experience, we add another knife. The Kolesov advanced method is produced on the basis of such high political labor enthusiasm combined with science. Why can't we learn?" "In the past, it took 100 hours to make a workpiece, but now it only takes 20 hours. Less time is used, more products are produced, and the cost is also reduced. Isn't this speeding up socialist construction?" The famous Lin Shizhai advanced group in Harbin City linked the discussion of the state-stipulated working hour quota during this study of the general line. Everyone realized that "setting the working hour quota advanced and accurately will accelerate industrial construction." They criticized the wrong behavior of individual workers who deliberately increased the working hours for the sake of getting more piecework wages with the spirit of the general line. A worker reviewed and said: "I must never let a few dollars hold back my legs from moving towards socialism. I must walk in front." Now, the workers of the whole group have used their collective wisdom to reduce the national working hours from 3.1 to 2.2.

I remember an example of Comrade Kirov engaged in propaganda work in a book. When studying production savings, Comrade Kirov was good at raising the seemingly small problems in industry and agriculture to the level of the Party's national tasks, prompting the workers and collective farmers to understand the significance of their labor, and pointing out the close relationship between their labor and the solution of those major political tasks with national significance. In 1934, the "Red Putilovite" factory began to produce plowing tractors. Kirov attributed the shortcomings in production to the fact that some workers did not understand what a plowing machine was, and did not understand the significance of the plowing machine for improving the material happiness of the laborers. Kirov pointed to a completed tractor during a visit to the factory:

"This machine, it is not a simple plowing machine. Comrades, this is the policy of the Party. You should explain to all the workers engaged in the production of plowing machines that the plowing machine you send to Central Asia - this is more cotton. More cotton - this is more cloth. More cloth - this is more underwear, sheets, and various towels, which is more wealthy workers and collective farm members. When you truly and Bolshevikly explain all this, then our cause will advance Bolshevikly."

State-owned enterprises are socialist enterprises. The employees are engaged in socialist conscious labor. The task of the Party organization's political work requires everyone to consciously improve their work and thinking in accordance with socialist principles to meet the needs of socialist industrialization. We must promote work Bolshevikly as Comrade Kirov said, then we must discover those ordinary but universally significant things from the process of production and life, from the depths of the masses' thinking, and raise them to the level of the general line and general tasks. Political workers must be good at using the viewpoint of the general line to explain every smallest achievement of the employees' production, point out its political significance, promote all factors that are conducive to socialist industrialization, oppose all factors that hinder socialist progress, and make the general line a regular driving force for transforming thinking and promoting production.

    工厂中宣传总路线应注意同日常劳动相结合
    本报记者　安　岗
      根据沈阳、哈尔滨两地的情况来看，总路线的宣传在大部分国营厂矿职工中已经发生了深刻的影响。经过宣传的厂矿，到处掀起了生产革新的热潮。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂职工提的口号是：
  “我们要增加车辆，使国家交通运输事业能赶上工业化的要求。我们要当建设社会主义的火车头”。“每一鎯头，每一锤子都是为了建设社会主义。”该厂车架小组在这一口号下认真执行了苏联专家的“汽缸拉线”的建议，由薄弱环节变成先进小组，提前完成生产计划，对保证完成机车检修任务起了决定作用。哈尔滨工具厂三车间提出口号是：“‘拉刀’是制造母机用的精密工具，母机是工业化的基础，多出产拉刀，缩小公差，保证质量，就会加快国家工业化速度”。该厂钳工金铁创造了“多刀，多卡活”的方法，提高生产效率三十六倍。总路线的教育鼓舞了工人改进手工操作方法的热情。水泥厂包装工人孙连君说：“我这打印的活，慢腾腾地怎能到社会主义呢，我要研究出机器才行哪。”现在，他已经创造出代替手工打印的机器。总路线的教育树立了职工完成任务的整体观念，松江机械厂过去调配人力常常受到阻碍，这次抽调技术强的工人时，工人说：“不管是谁的活，只要是为了完成国家的任务，我们就没有意见。”总路线的教育还鼓舞了工人向先进者看齐；工具厂工人左文文说：“过去我总觉得落后同先进都是靠干活吃饭，没有啥区别，听了总路线，我才明白这种想法不对。人人都像王崇伦那样一年完成四年的工作量，社会主义的好日子不就快了吗？”
    从这些事实中，可以看到一个重要问题：企业党组织如果善于把总路线同职工日常的生产劳动结合起来进行政治教育，就能引导人们的思想和行动经常不断地前进。但有些工厂却并不是这样。他们用突击方法，孤立地宣传总路线，宣传了一阵，就心满意足地统计受到总路线宣传的人数，而没有研究一下人们受教育的具体程度和尚待解决的思想问题；他们把总路线宣传同讨论和贯彻执行生产财务计划没有很好的结合起来。这种情况的产生，主要是由于有些同志认为“宣传工作反正是赶任务，什么工作来了都是我们挡头阵。”于是，就出现了一种所谓赶任务的宣传方法。总路线宣传开始时，这些地方的标语、黑板报上到处写满总路线字样，大会小会上都宣传一阵，及至群众要求提高，需要结合实际来提高总路线的宣传水平时，宣传工作就落到了群众的后边。先进的工厂情况与此相反，总路线宣传成为党委领导下的全党的政治任务，他们根据不同的对象（老工人、青年工人、技术人员等）围绕着总的口号，采取了不同的宣传形式，提出切合实际的行动口号。他们结合本企业的特点，当前的生产任务和职工的思想情况，着重说明每个人的劳动同实现国家社会主义工业化的关系，并指出每一个人努力的方向。这些工厂的宣传都收到良好效果，成为提高职工思想觉悟和推动生产的动力。宣传工作本身也随着群众思想的提高而大大加强起来。
    要使总路线宣传深入、持久地进行，就必须同职工日常劳动、生活密切结合。
    中长路中苏共管时期，哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂苏联总工程师伊里仁同志在每天的生产会议上都检查每个车间的出勤情况，他天天亲自掌握出勤数字，经常分析每个生产工人创造的价值，发现缺勤情况就立即查问，追究原因，采取措施。苏联专家要求政治工作者从政治上动员每个工人精确地计算每一分钟的劳动时间，使每一分钟都为国家创造更多的财富。苏联专家认为这是一切企业部门最重要的政治工作。我们要深入宣传总路线，就应当学习这种精神，从职工日常生活中树立职工社会主义的劳动观念，使每一个工人、技术人员的思想都能符合于社会主义工业化的需要。去年上半年沈阳机械七厂的工人出勤率很低，第一季度缺勤的总数是
  一万五千四百七十二个工作日，等于一千名工人半年没有生产。劳动纪律松弛的结果是事故随之不断发生。第一季度发生四次较大的事故，二百零六次一般性的事故。什么原因造成的呢？据工厂同志谈，主要是对新工人进行共产主义劳动观点和劳动纪律的教育做得不够，只讲一般的道理，不了解工人的思想和生活，宣传内容空洞、一般化，不能打动人心。这是一个很重要的教训。是不是机械七厂没有“打动人心”的事实呢？显然不是的。我曾问过一些老工人。老工人劳动观念一般是好的。他们有着丰富的阶级斗争知识和阶级情感。机械七厂一位老工人这样说：“我每天出入这个工厂大门时，我就会想到以前日本鬼子、国民党搜工人腰包的情景，过去一走近大门就害怕、愤怒，现在一看见大门就想到自己是主人。我们的劳动第一次是为着创造子子孙孙的幸福生活，过去作完一个活看一下时间，巴不得下班，现在总觉得自己做得还不多，太阳就落下去了。劳动成了我们最大的幸福。”我们的宣传工作者应当从生活中寻找这些朴素的可贵的材料，把它提高到共产主义原则上去教育广大工人，这就能够打动人心。
    再看看机械七厂占百分之七十的新来的青年工人的思想特点吧。新工人是从四面八方来的，带着不同的思想影响和特点走进工厂。机械七厂同志说：“我们工厂有三辈同堂的工人，祖父、父亲和儿子都在一起，这样的年青人最容易接受阶级教育，老工人的家规是：‘不许你给我丢脸’，迟到早退耍花招是不行的。青年们也想跟父亲比一比，他们在生产上干劲大，政治上也是骨干，要是有个别的人想调皮，就告诉他：‘问问你爸爸去，该这样吗？’‘忘本了吗？’他们就很快改变态度。
      “从农村中来的青年是有政治热情的，他们思想中还记得党领导农民进行土地改革的斗争，但，他们对城市和工厂的看法却有些不对头的地方，他们有的人不愿扛镢头，认为工厂的活‘轻松’，舒服，到工厂一看，实际情况跟他们想的不一样，工厂现在都在制造新产品，对工作物要求的也越来越严。工人思想稍一不集中就出了废品，比扛镢头难得多。生活呢？工厂生产一天天在扩大，宿舍房子却不能一时都准备妥当。几十个人挤在仓库里睡，吃饭还要排队。这是国家工业化前进道路上的困难！我们没有向这些青年们说明工厂的发展历史及工厂生产同国家社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造的关系，没有让老工人给他们上阶级教育的课。思想工作作的不够，就出了毛病，有的人碰到困难就躺在床上了。这样就降低了出勤率。
      “从城市市民中招来的一些工人，他们有的是作小买卖的，有的在高小、初小上了几年学，没有接触过生产，这些人有的是很好的，但有不少人想法不同，一不如意就想‘跳个厂吧！’‘学会本领远走高飞。’甚至有人还有‘小老板’思想，有人一面在工厂做工，一面在外面揽活。在外面干累了，跑到工厂来打瞌睡。资产阶级思想的影响曾经断送过一些这样的工人，总路线的学习可以使他们睁开了眼睛。”
    我们宣传工作者对于宣传对象常常忽视进行阶级的分析，因而在进行共产主义教育的时候，也不分对象，这是宣传上不能打动人心的一个原因。
    另一个原因是，宣传工作者不能随时研究那些日常的、看起来那怕是很细小的生活现象，作为宣传鼓动的题材，通过各种具体事实去引导人们的思想提高到共产主义的思想水平。
    怎样才能把日常的现象同社会主义工业化教育结合起来呢？
    我曾请一些熟悉生产业务的工厂领导者发表意见。他们认为：“最平常、但是最重要的是教育职工按照总路线精神，正确利用每一个工时。什么是工时？工时就是机器的转动数，就是人支配机器使之为工业化而加快转动的记录，就是企业每日每时为国家生产的物质财富。要社会主义工业化，就必须动员职工爱惜和正确利用每一个工时”。中长路中苏共管时期，苏联专家在哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂十分注意按照国家计划把一个工时应当创造的生产价值告诉工人，使他们懂得每人每日的劳动同国家利益的正确关系，并为超额完成国家任务而斗争。苏联专家用计算的方法根据年计划向工人说明季度产品总量和总值，然后按实际工作日来算出每天的总产量。同时按照国家计划编制劳动生产率，使每一个工人懂得在一定时间内（一年，一月，一个工作日，一个工作时），所生产的以货币计算的生产量，或是为制造各种产品所耗费的工作日或工时。党组织的政治工作根据实际的计算要求工人在八小时内作好四百八十分钟的工作，正确利用每一分钟为国家增加生产。党的政治工作向工人指明：只有爱惜每一分钟时间，在每一分钟时间内创造更高生产价值的人才是走向社会主义的带头人。
    我也请教了一些工人同志，一位加工车间工人对我讲：“你说工业化对我们工人来说是什么？”他停了一会说：“不是别的，就是巧妙地使用‘刀子’。我们要开动脑筋，用刀子来参加创造社会主义的伟大工作。”只要你留心，在一些机械工厂或车间常常可以看到这样一些现象：中午吃罢饭午休的时候，有的工人不是休息，而是在思索，手拿着粉笔在地上乱画。原来他们是根据车床的体性，工作物形状在那儿找角度，好使刀转动得快起来。工人们这样说：“我们想一切办法来把刀子磨好用好。第一次刀吃一分，第二次就吃一分半，第三次就吃二分。搞得有了经验就再增加一把刀子，科列索夫先进方法就是在这样高度政治的劳动的热情同科学结合的基础上产生的，我们为什么不能学？”“过去一个工作物用一百个小时才作得出，现在只用二十个小时，时间用得少了，产品也就出多了，成本也就跟着下降，这不就是加快了社会主义建设了吗？”哈尔滨市著名的林士太先进小组在这次学习总路线时就联系到讨论国家规定的工时定额，大家认识到：“把工时定额订得先进和准确，就会加速工业化建设。”他们用总路线的精神批评个别工人为多得计件工资故意提高工时的错误行为。一位工人检讨说：“绝不能叫几个钱扯住我走向社会主义的大腿，我一定要走在前边。”现在，全小组工人发挥了集体智慧，使国家工时由三点一降低到二点二。
    记得一本书上记述基洛夫同志从事宣传工作的例子。基洛夫同志在研究生产节约时，他善于把工业与农业中的初看仿佛是细小的问题提到全党的国家任务的水平上，向工人、集体农民们提示他们劳动的意义，指出他们的劳动与解决那些重大的具有全国意义的政治任务的密切关系。一九三四年在“红色布基洛夫人”工厂开始生产翻土拖拉机。基洛夫把生产中存在的缺点归结为某些工人不明白翻土机是什么，不明白翻土机对提高劳动者的物质的幸福的意义。基洛夫在某次参观工厂时指着一架装配完竣的拖拉机说：
        “这部机器，它不是简单的翻土机。同志们，这是党的政策。你们应该向所有从事生产翻土机工人们解释，被你们送到中亚细亚去的翻土机——这就是更多的棉花。更多的棉花——这就是更多的布疋。更多的布疋——这就是更多的内外衬衣，被单，各种手巾，这就是更多富裕的工人和集体农庄庄员。当你们真正地、布尔什维克式地解释了所有这一切，那么，那时我们的事业就会布尔什维克式地向前推进了。”
      国营企业是社会主义性质的企业。职工们从事着社会主义的自觉的劳动，党组织政治工作的任务要求每一个人自觉地按照社会主义原则来提高自己的工作和思想，以适应社会主义工业化的需要。我们要像基洛夫同志所说的那样布尔什维克式地推进工作，那就要从生产和生活的过程中，从群众思想的深处去发现那些平凡的，但有普遍意义的东西，把它们提高到总路线总任务的水平。政治工作者要善于用总路线的观点去阐明职工生产每一最小的成就，指出其政治的意义，发扬一切有利于社会主义工业化的因素，反对一切阻碍社会主义前进的因素，使总路线真正成为改造思想推进生产经常性的动力。
