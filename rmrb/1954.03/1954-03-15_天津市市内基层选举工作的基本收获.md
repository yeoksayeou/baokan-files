Basic Achievements of Grassroots Election Work in Tianjin Municipality

The grassroots election work in Tianjin Municipality, which started in May 1953 and basically concluded at the end of November, lasted for half a year.

In May of last year, the Tianjin Municipal Election Committee first conducted typical experiments in the Machang and Nanhuali streets of the Sixth District. Subsequently, the city conducted grassroots elections in three batches: the first batch was the Sixth District (pilot area), starting in June; the second batch was the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Tanggu Districts, starting in July; the third batch was the First, Second, Seventh, and Eighth Districts, starting in August. During the campaign, the city mobilized a total of 1,963 election guidance cadres, 3,416 technical cadres, and more than 600 reporters, 46,000 propagandists, and street activists to participate in election propaganda. By the end of November, the elections in each district had concluded successively.

The process of the movement was divided into two major stages and six steps. The first stage was the population survey and voter registration, which was divided into three steps: preparation, registration, and review. The second stage was the election, which was divided into three steps: announcing the list of voters, nominating candidates for representatives, and holding the election. After the elections, each district convened its first People's Congress in December 1953 and January 1954 respectively.

The grassroots election work in Tianjin Municipality has achieved the following five basic gains.

I. The masses' awareness has significantly improved.

In the grassroots elections in Tianjin, widespread and in-depth propaganda work was carried out based on the development of each stage and each step of the work, targeting the ideological conditions of the masses. In the early stage of the movement, the focus was on publicizing the significance of the election, and the enthusiasm of the masses was generally high. During the period of population survey, voter registration, and announcement of voter lists, propaganda was carried out on the significance of population surveys, the value of democratic rights, and the need to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. This made the masses realize who is the master of the country and who is the object of the dictatorship, thereby greatly enhancing the sense of ownership of the people. In the nomination of candidates for representatives and the election, propaganda was carried out on the nature of state power and how to nominate candidates. The broad masses of the working people expressed their support for the joint nomination by the Communist Party and various democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as the method of nominating several candidates for the number of representatives to be elected. At the same time, in response to the view of some people that this method was "undemocratic," the essence of democracy under the New Democracy, the hypocritical democratic forms of the old democracy, and the old democratic ideology were emphasized. This inspired the broad masses to cherish their democratic rights and actively participate in the discussion, identification, and voting of representative candidates.

When mobilizing the masses, special attention was paid to mobilizing the broad masses of women, which greatly enhanced their political enthusiasm. The experience of mobilizing women is: absorbing women's organizations to participate in the leadership work of elections at all levels; publicizing the important significance of women's participation in politics based on the specific ideological conditions of the women; solving the practical difficulties of women participating in political activities; and paying attention to the election of women representatives.

The improvement of the masses' ideological awareness is reflected in the following aspects:

First of all, the masses have a deeper understanding of the important significance of the people's democratic power led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. In particular, after comparing the new and old lives, workers and other working people generally realized that "oppression in the past was because power was in the hands of the reactionaries," and "after liberation, with power, we can have today's happy life." Therefore, the idea of loving the motherland was greatly promoted, and they had a correct understanding of the relationship between personal interests and national interests, and between immediate interests and long-term interests. For example, in the People's Congresses of various districts, proposals that simply demanded welfare without considering the possibilities have been greatly reduced.

Secondly, the masses further drew a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. In particular, with regard to the landlord class, many people who had lived in the city for a long time did not understand the ferocious nature of the landlords. Through the education on drawing a clear line between the enemy and ourselves and the work of reviewing voter qualifications, the masses had a clear understanding of the landlords. According to statistics, among the 3,882 letters and visits from the people, 2,527 were reports of landlords and counter-revolutionaries, and most of them were found to be true after review. The People's Courts of various districts accepted a total of five cases of disrupting elections and 115 cases of voter qualifications, of which 48 were reported by the masses. This ensured the successful conduct of the elections and prevented any reactionary elements and members of the landlord class from stealing the solemn right to vote.

Thirdly, due to the increased sense of ownership, the masses cherished their democratic rights and were very serious in discussing and identifying representative candidates. For example, the Fujian Road electoral district in the Sixth District nominated three women representative candidates. The voters enthusiastically launched evaluations. Some supported Wang Ziqiang (deputy director of the women's association), believing that she had working ability and could speak well; some supported Li Liying (deputy director of the residents' committee), believing that she was knowledgeable and enthusiastic in her work; but most agreed with Li Chengjun (deputy director of the women's association), believing that although her working ability was not as good as the above two, she could contact working women, work hard and be willing to bear hardships, organize women to produce, and truly do things for the masses. They also criticized Wang Ziqiang for sometimes only using her mouth and Li Liying for not contacting the working masses enough. For another example, in the Nanmendong electoral district of the First District, the democratic parties and people's organizations jointly nominated Gao Yuying (director of the women's association) as a representative candidate. In the voters' discussion, the majority opposed her, believing that she was only active towards her superiors and arrogant towards the masses. As a result, Sun Yunzhu (Pingju opera actress) was nominated as a representative candidate.

Finally, on the basis of the improved ideological awareness of the masses, the broad masses of voters actively participated in the elections. The proportion of voters participating in the elections in various districts reached a very high level. A total of 1,313,558 voters in the city, 1,244,019 people voted, accounting for 94.7% of the total number of voters. If voters who were out of town for business are subtracted, the proportion of voters in Tianjin was 99.2%. The proportion of voters participating in the elections in factories and institutions was even higher than that of street residents. According to statistics from 11 factory electoral districts in the Fourth District, the number of participants reached 97.4%; the state-owned Mianfang No. 3 Factory reached over 99%; and the Tianjin Cannery reached 100%. The proportion of women participating in the elections was higher than that of men, with women participating in the elections accounting for over 95% of the city's female voters. In the elections, there were many touching examples of actively participating in elections and cherishing the right to vote. Jiang Baozhen, a young woman in the Fourth District, was getting married during the election. When the wedding car arrived at the door, she waited two hours before getting in so that she could vote. She said: "Marriage is a big event, but elections are even bigger. Marriage is a joy, and elections are a great joy." Many voters who were out of town for business made a special trip back, and some expressed their opinions by leaving letters, etc.

II. The general election played a role in promoting production.

Election work not only does not contradict production, but can also become a driving force for promoting production. Due to the enhanced awareness of the working class and other working people as masters of the country, production enthusiasm and creativity have been greatly developed, and many new atmospheres have emerged in production. The staff and workers of various factories have successively presented gifts to the general election with practical actions such as increasing the quantity and quality of products and launching production competitions. After the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's No. 1 Weaving Shop's C Class No. 2 Section proposed to do a good job of the "two-to-one" work method to welcome the general election and challenged the whole factory, the workers who used this work method accounted for 70% in September last year and reached 90% in October, and the product quality was also improved. Zhang Zhongkui and other workers in the power generation room of Dagu Chemical Plant had an important rationalization proposal. Because they felt unsure, they hesitated for several months and did not propose it. After the general election began, they realized that they were the masters of the country and the factory, so they resolutely proposed it and successfully tested it, increasing the factory's current by 13% and improving production. After being educated by the general election, the employees of the jointly owned Sanhecheng Mast Lamp Factory increased the output of mast lamps from 900 per day to 1,000, and the output of aluminum pots also increased from 11,000 kg per month to 12,000 kg. Before the general election, the private Tonghuamao Machinery Iron Factory's responsibility system was just a formality. Some workers did not abide by labor discipline, talking and laughing during work hours, and dozing off and sleeping during night shifts. As a result, the quality of products was low and defective products often occurred. After the general election, the whole factory put forward the slogan of "strengthening the responsibility system, abiding by labor discipline, and improving product quality." Each group formulated guarantees to overcome shortcomings, and the production situation has been greatly improved, reversing the past phenomenon of frequent defective products. In the first People's Congresses held in various districts, the masses, through their representatives, put forward a large number of proposals related to increasing production and practicing economy, and the congresses all took increasing production and practicing economy as one of the main topics.

The main experiences of combining the general election with production are: 1. The factory leaders must pay attention to it, arrange and deploy the general election work in a unified manner according to the production situation, and have a special person responsible for the general election work. 2. Conduct in-depth propaganda in the workshops, not only pay attention to publicizing to young activists, but also pay attention to publicizing to old workers, because they know more about the past and have a great influence on their words, and can use their own experiences to drive young workers to value the right to vote. 3. Grasp the specific problems existing in the current production of each factory, workshop, and group, and mobilize workers to use their brains to solve them. This is the specific content of combining the general election with production. 4. When conducting the general election in factories, no production time should be occupied, and it should only be carried out in workers' spare time. The total number of hours that each step should take should be controlled within 18 hours. 5. In other enterprises, departments, institutions, schools, and streets, the election work should also be carried out during spare time according to the work, study, and life patterns of the masses. The work of dividing electoral districts, voter groups, and setting up registration stations should also proceed from the convenience of the masses' activities.

III. Strengthened the unity of the people of all circles.

First of all, judging from the election results, the leading position of the working class in the political power has been greatly strengthened, and other democratic classes have also had appropriate representatives elected. A total of 1,426 district people's representatives were elected in the city, of which 997 were from the working class (including cadres), accounting for 69.9% of the total number of representatives. There were 389 women representatives, accounting for 27.28%; 67 ethnic minorities, accounting for 4.96%. Among the 160 district heads, deputy district heads, and district people's government members elected in the city, 101 were from the working class (including cadres), accounting for over 63%; 59 were from industrialists and businessmen, cultural and educational circles, handicraftsmen, and other classes, accounting for over 36%. Many of the representatives and members of the district people's governments are model figures in production and well-known figures from all walks of life. According to statistics from the six districts of the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts, 204 people who won the title of model were elected, including 123 industrial and other labor models. In addition, four industrial labor models, two women, and two industrialists and businessmen were elected as deputy district heads.

Secondly, the first People's Congresses of various districts concentrated the will and demands of the people, discussed and adopted resolutions on implementing the national general line, carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strengthening the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts, mobilizing the broad masses to strive for the realization of the national general line. Therefore, it can be affirmed that the organizational form of the people's political power generated through the general election is "an important organizational form that facilitates the working class to realize leadership, facilitates the vast majority of the people to concentrate and realize their will, and can fully educate the people and mobilize the people to participate in the construction of the motherland" (Resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference), and is also a powerful weapon and guarantee for the successful implementation of the general line and general task of the country during the transition period.

Through the general election, the mutual relations between factories, institutions, street residents, and various organizations have become closer. The unity among various ethnic groups and within ethnic minorities has also been further enhanced. In the Dahuo Xiang and Xiaohuo Xiang streets in the Eighth District, where the Hui and Han people live together, there have been friendly phenomena of Hui and Han people giving way to each other as representatives in the election. Some of the disunity phenomena that existed in street organizations in the past have also been resolved through the general election due to the improved awareness of the masses. A large number of new activists have emerged in the streets. According to statistics from seven streets such as Xianchun Garden and Nantouyao in the Eighth District, more than 530 new activists have emerged. On the basis of the improved awareness of the masses, internal disputes among the masses have been sharply reduced. According to a survey in the Fourth District, the Li Gonglou Street mediated more than 40 mass disputes in June last year, and the number dropped to 20 in November.

IV. Both cadres and the masses have received a profound democratic education.

The municipal and district election committees have fully carried out education on promoting democracy for the cadres participating in the election work. In the work, the masses' attitude as masters of the country has also had a profound impact on the working cadres, so the style of the vast majority of cadres is democratic. Through the general election movement, many cadres felt that this was a major lesson in democracy. Secondly, in the discussion and evaluation of representative candidates, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and the grassroots cadres of the government, various people's organizations, and the broad masses of activists were generally鉴别 by the masses. The good ones were praised; those with shortcomings were criticized and educated; and a small number of bad elements who were extremely dissatisfied by the masses were eliminated. In this way, the connection between the government and the people was greatly strengthened, the grassroots organizations of the political power and various people's organizations were purified, and the political enthusiasm of the people was improved. For example, when discussing representative candidates, the masses of Suweilu in the Third District raised many opinions on candidate Zhang Zhiyin. Zhang Zhiyin made a self-criticism. Voters, activists, and cadres all received a great education from it. After the meeting, the deputy director of the local residents' committee said: "We must do a good job in the future, pay attention to the democratic style, and we cannot be separated from the masses!" The street cadres said that they should also carefully check their work after the election; the masses also said with satisfaction: If the cadres have shortcomings, they can be corrected in the future.

V. Through the population survey and registration, the city's population figures have been clarified, providing a reliable population basis for economic, cultural, and national defense construction.

   天津市市内基层选举工作的基本收获
    天津市市内基层选举工作，自一九五三年五月开始至十一月底基本结束，历时半年。
    去年五月，天津市选举委员会先在第六区马场和南华里两街进行了典型试验。接着，全市分三批进行了基层选举：第一批为六区（试办区），六月份开始；第二批是三、四、五、塘沽区，在七月份开始；第三批是一、二、七、八区，八月份开始。在运动中，全市共抽调普选指导干部一千九百六十三人，技术干部三千四百一十六人，并有报告员六百余人、宣传员和街道积极分子四万六千余人，参加了普选宣传。至十一月底各区选举先后结束。
    运动的过程分为两大阶段和六个步骤。第一阶段是人口调查和选民登记，其中分为准备、登记和复查三个步骤。第二阶段是选举，其中分公布选民名单、提出代表候选人和选举三个步骤。选举结束后，各区于一九五三年十二月及一九五四年一月分别召开了首次区人民代表大会。
    天津市市内基层选举工作取得了以下五项基本收获。
    一、群众觉悟显著提高。
    天津市在基层选举中，依据每个阶段、每个工作步骤的发展，针对群众思想情况，进行了广泛、深入的宣传工作。在运动初期，着重进行了选举的意义的宣传，群众情绪普遍高涨。在人口调查、选民登记和公布选民名单时期，进行了人口调查意义、民主权利之可贵和划清敌我界限的宣传，使群众认识了谁是国家的主人，谁是专政的对象，从而大大提高了人民群众的主人翁思想。在提出代表候选人和选举中，进行了国家政权性质及如何提候选人的宣传，广大劳动人民对共产党和各民主党派、各人民团体联合提名和一般选几名代表提几名候选人的方法表示拥护。同时，也针对一部分人士认为这种办法“不民主”的看法，着重宣传了新民主主义的民主实质和批判了旧民主主义虚伪的民主形式及旧民主主义思想，启发广大群众珍视民主权利，积极参加代表候选人的讨论、鉴别和投票。
    在发动群众时，特别注意了发动广大妇女，使妇女的政治积极性大为提高。发动妇女的经验是：吸收妇女组织参加选举的各级领导工作；依据妇女群众的具体思想情况，宣传妇女参政的重要意义；解决妇女参加政治活动的实际困难；注意妇女代表人物的当选。
    群众思想觉悟的提高表现在以下几方面：
    首先，群众对工人阶级领导的、工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权的重要意义，有了更深刻的认识。特别是工人和其他劳动人民经过新旧生活的对比，普遍认识到“过去受压迫就是因为政权掌握在反动派手里”，“解放后有了政权，才能有今天的幸福生活”，因而热爱祖国的思想大大发扬，对个人利益和国家利益，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，有了正确的认识。如在各区人民代表大会中，不根据可能而单纯要求福利的提案已大大减少。
    其次，群众进一步划清了敌我界限。特别是对地主阶级分子，过去很多久居城市的人不了解地主的凶恶本质，经过划清敌我界限的教育和选民资格审查工作，使群众对地主有了清楚的认识。据统计，在三千八百八十二件人民来信、来访中，属于检举地主、反革命的就有二千五百二十七件，经审查大部属实。各区人民法庭共受理了破坏选举案件五件，选民资格案件一百一十五件，其中也有四十八件是群众检举的。这样就保证了选举的胜利进行和不让一个反动分子和地主阶级分子窃取庄严的选举权利。
    再次，群众由于主人翁思想提高，十分珍视自己的民主权利，对代表候选人的讨论、鉴别十分认真。如第六区福建路选区共提出三位妇女代表候选人，选民们热烈展开评比，有的拥护王子强（妇女副主任），认为她有工作能力，会讲话；有的拥护李丽英（居民委员会副主任），认为她学问深，办事热心；但多数都赞成李承钧（妇女副主任），认为她工作能力虽不如以上二人，但能联系劳动妇女，任劳任怨，组织妇女生产，真正给群众办了事。并对王子强有时候只动嘴和李丽英联系劳动群众不够等缺点提出了批评。又如第一区南门东选区，各民主党派、人民团体联合提出高玉英（妇女主任）做代表候选人，在选民讨论中多数反对，认为她只是对上积极，对群众则自高自大，结果另外提出孙芸竹（评剧演员）做了代表候选人。
    最后，在群众觉悟提高的基础上，广大选民积极参加了选举。各区参加选举的选民都达到了很高比例。全市选民共一百三十一万三千五百五十八人，有一百二十四万四千零一十九人投了票，占选民总数的百分之九十四点七强，如减去因事外出的选民，占在天津的选民的百分之九十九点二弱。工厂、机关的选民参加选举的比例更高于街道市民，据第四区十一个工厂选区的统计，参加选举人数达百分之九十七点四；国营棉纺三厂达百分之九十九强；天津罐头厂达百分之百。妇女参加选举比例高于男子，参加选举的妇女占全市女选民的百分之九十五强。在选举中出现了许多珍贵选举权利积极参加选举的动人事例。第四区青年妇女蒋宝珍，结婚时正赶上选举，花车已到门口，她为了投票，等了两个钟头才上车。她说：“结婚是大事，选举更是大事，结婚是喜，选举是大喜。”有不少因事外出的选民都特地赶回，也有用留信、来信等办法表达自己的意见的。
    二、普选起了推动生产的作用。
    选举工作与生产不仅不矛盾，而且还可以成为推动生产的动力。由于工人阶级及其他劳动人民提高了国家主人翁的觉悟，生产积极性和创造性大大发扬，生产上出现了很多新气象。各工厂职工纷纷以提高产品数量和质量、展开生产竞赛等实际行动向普选献礼。国营棉纺二厂一布场丙班二部提出作好“二比一”工作法迎接普选，并向全厂挑战后，运用这个工作法的工人，去年九月份有百分之七十，十月份达到了百分之九十，产品质量也提高了。大沽化工厂发电室工人张仲魁等，有一重要合理化建议，由于感到没把握，犹疑了几个月没有提；普选开始后，他们认识到自己是国家和工厂的主人，就坚决提出并试验成功，使该厂电流增加了百分之十三，提高了生产。公私合营三合成桅灯厂职工受到普选教育后，桅灯产量由每天九百个提高到一千个，铝锅产量也由每月一万一千斤增到一万二千斤。私营同华茂机器铁工厂，普选以前，专责制流于形式，有的工人不遵守劳动纪律，上班时谈笑、打闹，夜班打盹、睡觉，因而产品质量低，常出废品。普选以后，全厂提出了“加强专责制，遵守劳动纪律，提高产品质量”的口号，各小组订出克服缺点的保证，生产情况大有改进，扭转了过去经常出废品的现象。在各区召开的首次人民代表大会中，群众通过代表提出了大量有关增产节约的提案，大会都以增产节约为主要议题之一。
    普选结合生产的主要经验是：1、工厂的领导必须重视，把普选工作根据生产情况统一安排与布置，并有专人负责普选工作。2、深入车间展开宣传，不仅注意对青年积极分子展开宣传，也要注意对老工人进行宣传，因为他们了解过去事情多，说话影响大，能够现身说法带动青年工人重视选举权利。3、抓住各厂、车间、小组当前生产中存在的具体问题，发动工人开动脑筋去解决，这是普选结合生产的具体内容。4、在工厂进行普选工作，一律不占用生产时间，只在工人业余时间进行，各项步骤应占的钟点，总共控制在十八小时之内。5、在其他企业部门、机关、学校以及街道中，也都要根据群众的工作、学习和生活规律，抓空隙时间进行选举工作。在划分选区、选民小组和设立登记站的工作上也应从群众活动方便出发。
    三、加强了各界人民的团结。
    首先，从选举结果看，工人阶级在政权中的领导地位大大加强，其他各民主阶级也均有适当的代表人物当选。全市共选出区人民代表一千四百二十六名，其中工人阶级（包括干部在内）有九百九十七名，占代表总数的百分之六十九点九。代表中妇女共三百八十九名，占百分之二十七点二八；少数民族六十七名，占百分之四点九六。全市选出的一百六十个区长、副区长和区人民政府委员中，工人阶级（包括干部）一百零一人，占百分之六十三强；工商业者、文教界、手工业者及其他阶层共五十九人，占百分之三十六强。代表和各区人民政府委员中，很多人是生产上的模范人物和各界的知名人士。据一、三、四、五、七、八六个区的统计，就有二百零四名荣获模范称号的人物当选；其中包括工业及其他方面的劳动模范一百二十三人。另有四个工业劳动模范、两位妇女、两位工商业者当选为副区长。
    其次，各区首次人民代表大会，都集中了人民的意志和要求，讨论、通过了贯彻国家总路线，开展增产节约运动以及加强对私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造等决议，动员了广大群众为实现国家总路线而奋斗。因此可以肯定，通过普选所产生的人民政权组织形式，是“便利于工人阶级实现领导，便利于最大多数人民集中和实现其意志，和能够充分教育人民、发动人民参加祖国建设事业的主要的组织形式”（第二次全国民政会议决议），也是胜利贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的有力武器和保证。
    经过普选，工厂、机关和街道市民以及各个组织之间的相互关系密切了。各民族以及少数民族内部的团结也更加增强。第八区回汉民杂居的大伙巷、小伙巷等街，在选举中，都曾出现过回汉民互相推让代表的友爱现象。街道组织中过去存在的某些不团结现象，经过普选，由于群众觉悟提高也得到解决。街道中并涌现了大批新的积极分子，仅据八区先春园、南头窑等七个街的统计，即涌现了新积极分子五百三十余名。在群众觉悟提高的基础上，群众内部纠纷锐减，根据第四区的调查，李公楼街去年六月份调解群众纠纷四十多起，十一月降到二十起。
    四、干部和群众都受到一次深刻的民主教育。
    市、区选举委员会对参加选举工作的干部都进行了充分发扬民主的教育，在工作中，群众的主人翁态度也给工作干部以深刻的影响，因而绝大部分干部的作风是民主的。经过普选运动，很多干部感到这是上了一次民主大课。其次，在代表候选人的讨论、评比中，结合开展了批评与自我批评，政府、各人民团体的基层干部以及广大积极分子，都普遍受了一次群众的鉴别。好的受到了表扬；有缺点的受到了批评教育；少数坏的、为群众所极端不满的分子，则被剔除出去。这样，就大大加强了政府和人民的联系，纯洁了政权和各人民团体的基层组织，提高了人民的政治积极性。如第三区宿纬路群众在讨论代表候选人时，对候选人张志银提出很多意见。张志银做了检讨。选民、积极分子、干部都从中受到很大教育。会后当地居民委员会副主任说：“以后可得好好干，注意民主作风，脱离了群众可不行！”街干部表示选举完后也要好好检查一下工作；群众也满意地说：干部有缺点，今后改了就行了。
    五、经过人口调查登记，查清了全市人口数字，为经济、文化和国防建设提供了可靠的人口依据。
