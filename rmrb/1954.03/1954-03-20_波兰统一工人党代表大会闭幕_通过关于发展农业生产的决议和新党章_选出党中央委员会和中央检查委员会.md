Xinhua News Agency, March 18th, Warsaw: The Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party continued on the 16th, according to the Polish Press Agency.

    The congress continued to discuss Novak's report on the fourth item on the agenda. Fifteen delegates spoke in the discussion of this report over the past two days. In their speeches, they discussed Poland's achievements and shortcomings in developing agriculture, and pointed out ways to increase agricultural production in the future. Many delegates also emphasized the great role of the Party in developing agriculture. The congress unanimously adopted the resolution "Tasks for Developing Agriculture in 1954 and 1955 and Necessary Measures to Increase Agricultural Production." The resolution stipulates the methods for developing agricultural production, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and improving the material welfare of the people.

    Edward Ochab, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, then gave a report on the fifth item on the agenda, "Organizational Work and Revision of the Party Constitution." Ochab pointed out that due to the changes that have taken place in Poland's socialist construction, the maturity and consolidation of the United Workers' Party organizations at all levels, and the training of party members in class struggle, it is necessary to make some amendments to the Party Constitution and to make higher demands on party members. He said that the Party Constitution Revision Committee is working with reference to the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and according to the different historical development of Poland. The Party Constitution Revision Committee suggested that the general program of the Party Constitution should stipulate that the Polish United Workers' Party should take the science of Marxism-Leninism as a guide in all its activities. The main tasks of the Polish United Workers' Party at present are: to build a socialist society; to continuously improve the material and cultural level of the working class and all urban and rural working people by continuing to develop production on a higher technical basis; to educate members of society in the spirit of patriotism and internationalism; and to strengthen the people's power and national defense forces. Ochab then talked about the contents of the amendments and supplements to the various articles of the Party Constitution. Ochab concluded by saying that the new Party Constitution will be a more effective tool for educating party members politically and organizationally. It can make party members highly conscious, disciplined, and indomitable fighters in the struggle for the complete victory of our great cause.

    After Ochab's report, the delegates began a discussion on the report. Seven delegates spoke in the discussion. The congress unanimously adopted the new Party Constitution of the Polish United Workers' Party proposed by the Party Constitution Revision Committee.

    At the meeting on the 16th, the representative of the Mexican Communist Party delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress.

    波兰统一工人党代表大会闭幕
    通过关于发展农业生产的决议和新党章
    选出党中央委员会和中央检查委员会
    【新华社十八日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会在十六日继续进行。
    大会继续讨论诺瓦克所作的关于第四项议程的报告。两天来在讨论这个报告中发言的共有十五位代表。他们在发言中谈到了波兰在发展农业方面的成就和缺点，并指出了今后提高农业生产的方法。许多代表还着重指出了党在发展农业中的巨大作用。大会一致通过了“一九五四年和一九五五年发展农业的任务和增加农业生产的必要措施”的决议。决议规定了发展农业生产、加强工农联盟和提高人民的物质福利的办法。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记爱·奥哈布接着在会上就第五项议程“组织工作和修改党章”作了报告。奥哈布指出：由于波兰在社会主义建设中所发生的变化，由于统一工人党各级组织已经成熟和巩固，以及党员在阶级斗争中得到了锻炼，因此，必须对党章作若干修正，对党员提出更高的要求。他说：党章修改委员会是参照苏联共产党的经验并根据波兰历史发展的不同情况来从事工作的。党章修改委员会建议党章总纲中应规定：波兰统一工人党在其一切活动中应以马克思列宁主义的科学为指针。波兰统一工人党目前的主要任务是：建设社会主义社会；用在更高的技术的基础上继续发展生产的办法，来不断提高工人阶级和城乡全体劳动人民的物质和文化水平；以爱国主义和国际主义的精神来教育社会成员；加强人民政权和国防力量。奥哈布接着谈到了对党章各条的修正和补充的内容。奥哈布最后说：新党章将是在政治上和组织上教育党员的更有效的工具。它可以使党员们在争取我们伟大事业的完全胜利的斗争中成为具有高度觉悟的、有纪律的、不屈不挠的战士。
    奥哈布报告毕，代表们对这一报告展开了讨论。在讨论中发言的有七位代表。代表大会一致通过了党章修改委员会所提出的波兰统一工人党新党章。
    在十六日会议上向大会致贺词的有墨西哥共产党的代表。
    【新华社十八日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会于十七日闭幕。
