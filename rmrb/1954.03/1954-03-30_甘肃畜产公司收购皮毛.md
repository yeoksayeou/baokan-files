    Gansu Province is entering its peak season for various types of sheep hides and furs, and the China National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation Gansu Branch is actively purchasing them. The China National Native Produce and Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation Gansu Branch plans to purchase 55 percent more various hides and skins this year than last year to support industrial construction and supply the people. Before the various hides and skins came on the market, the Provincial Livestock Company established trading markets in major hides and furs distribution centers such as Pingliang, Xifeng, Tianshui, and Wuwei. It also sent a large number of cadres to the major hides and furs production areas to help cooperatives do a good job in purchasing and storing hides and skins. Small-scale livestock product exhibitions were held in Lanzhou, Wuwei, and other places to publicize the specifications, quality, and storage methods of hides and skins to the vast number of farmers and herdsmen.
