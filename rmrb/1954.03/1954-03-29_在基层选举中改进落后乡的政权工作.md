    Improving the Work of Political Power in Backward Townships During Basic-Level Elections
  　Wang Qing
    According to many investigative materials, approximately ten percent of backward villages are scattered across the country. In these villages, the policies of the Party and the People's Government cannot be correctly implemented, various tasks cannot be carried out smoothly, the people do not have normal democratic lives, mutual aid and cooperation organizations cannot develop, or only have organizational forms without actual content, capitalist spontaneous forces are developing, and classes are being re-stratified. Today, the cause of socialist construction and transformation has been vigorously launched in all aspects, and agricultural production urgently needs to undergo socialist transformation through mutual aid and cooperation. Therefore, changing the conditions of backward villages and enabling them to catch up with advanced areas has become a problem that party and government leading organs in various places should pay close attention to.

    Doing a good job in the general election is closely related to changing the work of backward villages. This is not only because the general election movement can generally improve the political enthusiasm of the masses, but also because the masses can use their voting rights to directly elect outstanding advanced figures according to their own will to replace those bad elements who have infiltrated the basic-level political power, and to spur those basic-level cadres who are slack in their work to become active. Therefore, the slogan "rectifying backwardness through general elections" put forward by some regions is completely correct. Today's facts about Daobei Township in Pingyao County and Donglu Township in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, published in this newspaper, also prove this point.

    The formation of backward villages is roughly due to two reasons. One is that the leading components of basic-level political power are impure, and political power has been usurped by counter-revolutionary elements, landlord class elements, local bullies, leaders of reactionary secret societies, or other bad elements. Donglu Township in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, before rectification, belonged to this category. After the counter-revolutionary elements usurped political power, they used the power of the government to openly or secretly sabotage the various tasks of the People's Government and oppress the people. Or they deliberately used coercive methods to carry out work, alienating the relationship between the people and the government, creating sectarian struggles, while also "feigning compliance" and "falsely reporting achievements" to deceive the bureaucratic elements in the higher-level organs, so that they could do evil. Any activists who dared to expose them and fight against them were subjected to cruel persecution. The incident of bad element Yang Maolin's long-term occupation of the township political power in the fourth district and fourth township of Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, published in this newspaper last April, is a prominent example. In this type of village, through the mass-based and meticulous review of voter qualifications in the general election, the true faces of those bad elements can be exposed, the voting rights of those enemies of the people can be deprived, and all possibilities for the enemy to infiltrate the basic-level political power can be blocked. In the process of nominating, discussing, and electing people's representatives, voters can select their own representatives according to their own wishes, which can further enhance the people's sense of ownership and remove those who have helped and echoed bad elements in deceiving the higher authorities and oppressing the people. The key issue here is to fully promote democracy and give the people full freedom to express their will. In the past, in some areas, there were facts that county and district cadres blindly trusted those bad elements who pretended to be active, favored and shielded those bad elements, and forced the masses to elect them, bringing more disasters to the people. This kind of bad phenomenon must be completely eliminated in this general election. Any form and any degree of coercion and arrangement are impermissible illegal acts.

    The other type of backward village is caused by township and village cadres being tired, negative, or often using simple command methods to carry out work, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and causing the work to fall into a state of decline and backwardness. The essence of these cadres is not necessarily very bad, and many of them were once activists in various movements. However, because the higher authorities did not regularly educate them, so they do not understand the socialist prospects and the great future of the country, and do not understand the purpose and methods of their work, so they have lost their vigor and stagnated. In this type of area, if the general election work is done well, it can completely change the situation. In this type of area, the general election movement must be closely combined with the work of publicizing and implementing the general line of the state during the transition period. The propaganda of the general line can fundamentally improve the consciousness of the cadres and liberate them from the state of depression and from the influence of capitalist spontaneous forces. After the political consciousness and enthusiasm of the cadres have been improved through the propaganda of the general line, they should be further helped to summarize the past work and to check the shortcomings and errors in the past work. If they should be responsible for them, they should be educated and inspired to take the initiative to conduct self-criticism to the masses. At the same time, the masses should be mobilized to make criticisms and suggestions to them. As long as they can sincerely review, change their attitude, and actively participate in the general election movement, and conscientiously and responsibly lead the masses to do their work well, the masses may continue to trust them and elect them as people's representatives. Such examples have appeared in many areas. These areas have become vigorous after the general election.

    To change the situation of backward villages through general elections, the primary condition is to strengthen the leadership of the general election work in these areas, and to use experienced and capable cadres to lead the general election work in these areas. In the past, the party and government leading organs in some areas held a discriminatory attitude towards backward villages. They called these areas "dead corners" and ignored them for a long time. Before carrying out a major task, they are always accustomed to "creating experience" in one or two advanced villages to promote the general. The experience of this advanced village may be applicable to some areas; but for backward villages that need to fundamentally change the leading components of political power, or fundamentally mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres, it is often not applicable, and mechanical hard application will only make things worse. In this general election, many areas have already created some experience in advanced villages and general villages, which is of course very necessary. But it cannot be limited to these, but must also create experience in changing the backward state in backward villages. Since our purpose is to completely change the backward state of backward villages through general elections, fundamentally change the leading components of political power, or fundamentally change the ideological state of political cadres, we should use even greater strength in backward villages. In these backward villages, first of all, democratic politics should be publicized to the broad masses, so that the masses can recognize that their democratic rights are guaranteed by law and by the Party and the People's Government. This right is not allowed to be deprived by anyone, and whoever wants to deprive the people of this right is a serious illegal act. At the same time, the masses should be made to realize that political cadres and even all cadres must obey the people's will and serve the people. They are the people's servants, not the people's rulers and oppressors. Any cadre must be subject to the supervision of the people, and the people have the right to elect them or replace them. Only when the masses of people have this kind of awakening can they expose all the bad deeds of the bad elements and the errors and shortcomings of the negative elements in order to seek a thorough solution. Secondly, in the process of general election activities, special attention should be paid to discovering advanced elements who can represent the people's will and demands, and they should be carefully cultivated so that they can rapidly improve in all aspects and become talents who can effectively serve the people. After the general election, these talents are elected to various leading positions in the political power. After the general election, it is necessary to help the new political power organizations and cadres establish various necessary work systems, especially to help them learn to use the People's Congress to understand the people's demands, absorb the people's opinions, deploy, inspect and promote various tasks, and develop mutual aid cooperation and production. According to the experience of Donglu Township, this kind of assistance after the general election is very important. Otherwise, the work will stagnate.

    These tasks are arduous and difficult. But in order to fundamentally change the face of backward villages, so that the policies, laws, and regulations of the Party and the People's Government and all work can begin to be implemented in these villages, meet with the people, and exert their strength, and organize the people of these villages into socialist construction and socialist transformation, and rapidly promote this construction and transformation work, we must resolutely do it and cannot delay it in any way.

    在基层选举中改进落后乡的政权工作
  　王　青
    根据许多调查材料，当前约有百分之十左右的落后乡村分散在全国各地。在这些乡村中，党和人民政府的政策不能正确贯彻，各种工作不能顺利开展，人民没有正常的民主生活，互助合作组织不能发展，或只具有组织形式而无实际内容，资本主义自发势力在发展，阶级在重新分化。今天，社会主义建设和改造事业已经在各方面蓬勃展开，农业生产急需经过互助合作来实现社会主义的改造；因此，改变落后乡村的状况，使它们迎头赶上先进地区，就成了各地党政领导机关应该严加注意的问题。
    认真作好普选工作，对于改变落后乡村的工作有着十分密切的关系。这不仅是因为普选运动一般地可以提高群众的政治积极性，而且是由于群众可以运用自己的选举权利，直接按照自己的意志选出优秀的先进人物来代替那些混入基层政权的坏分子，并鞭策那些工作松懈的基层干部积极起来。因此若干地区提出“经过普选、整顿落后”的口号，是完全正确的。今天本报发表的山西平遥县道备乡和临汾县东芦乡的事实，也正说明这点。
    落后乡村的形成，大体由于两种原因。一种是基层政权领导成分不纯，政权被反革命分子、地主阶级分子、恶霸、反动会道门头子或其他坏分子篡夺了。山西省临汾县的东芦乡在整顿以前即属于这一类。反革命分子篡夺政权之后，即利用政权的力量，公开或暗中破坏人民政府的各项工作，欺压人民。或者是故意用强迫命令的办法进行工作，离间人民和政府的关系，制造宗派斗争，同时又“阳奉阴违”、“假报成绩”来骗取上级机关中官僚主义分子的信任，以便于他们为非作歹。任何敢于揭发他们、向他们进行斗争的积极分子，都受到残酷的迫害。本报去年四月发表的陕西省醴泉县四区四乡坏分子杨茂林长期盘据乡政权事件，就是一个突出的例子。在这类乡村，经过普选工作中群众性的对选民资格的细密审查，就可以暴露那些坏分子的真面目，剥夺那些人民敌人的选举权利，并且堵塞敌人混入基层政权的一切可能。在代表候选人提名、讨论和选举人民代表的过程中，由选民按照自己的志愿挑选自己的代表，更可以提高人民群众的主人翁感觉，把那些曾经帮助与附和坏分子欺骗上级、压迫人民的分子也统统赶下台去。这里的关键问题是充分发扬民主，给人民表达自己意志的充分自由。过去某些地区选举中，曾有过因为县、区干部盲目信任那些假装积极的坏分子，偏袒、包庇那些坏分子，而强迫群众选举他们，给人民带来更多灾难的事实，这次普选中必须彻底消灭这种恶劣现象。任何形式和任何程度的强迫和包办，都是不能容许的违法行为。
    另一类落后乡村的造成，是由于乡、村干部疲沓、消极，或经常以简单的命令方法进行工作，引起群众不满，使工作陷于消沉落后状态。这些干部的本质并不一定很坏，他们之中的许多人曾经是各种运动中的积极分子。但因上级没有经常教育他们，使他们了解社会主义的远景和国家的远大前程，了解自己工作的目的和方法，所以他们丧失了朝气，停滞不前了。这类地区，普选工作如果作得好，也是完全可以改变面貌的。在这类地区，普选运动必须和宣传贯彻国家过渡时期总路线的工作密切结合起来。总路线的宣传，可以从根本上提高干部的觉悟，把他们从消沉状态中、从资本主义自发势力的影响中解脱出来。经过总路线的宣传，干部的政治觉悟和积极性有了提高之后，就要进一步帮助他们总结过去的工作，帮助他们检查过去工作中的缺点和错误。其中确应由他们自己负责的，就教育和启发他们主动向群众进行检讨。同时也发动群众向他们提出批评建议。只要他们能够诚恳检讨，转变态度，并积极参加普选运动，认真负责地领导群众做好工作，群众就有可能继续信任他们，选举他们为人民代表。这样的事例已在不少地区出现。这些地区在普选之后变得朝气勃勃了。
    要经过普选来改变落后乡村的状况，首要的条件是加强这类地区普选工作的领导，用有经验有能力的干部来领导这类地区的普选工作。在过去，有些地区的党政领导机关对于落后乡村是抱着歧视态度的。他们把这类地区称为“死角”，长期不闻不问。在推行某项重大工作之前，又总是习惯于在一、二个先进乡村“创造经验”，以推动一般。这种先进乡村的经验，对于一部分地区可能是适用的；但对于需要从根本上改变政权领导成分，或从根本上发动干部革命热情的落后乡村，却往往并不适用，机械的硬套，只会使事情弄得更糟。在这次普选中，许多地区已经在先进乡村和一般乡村创造了一些经验，这当然也是十分需要的。但不能限于这些，而必须同样也在落后乡村创造改变落后状态的经验。由于我们的目的是要经过普选来彻底改变落后乡村的落后面貌，根本改变政权领导成分，或根本改变政权干部的思想状况，所以在落后乡村还应该用更大一些的力量。在这些落后乡村，首先应该对广大群众进行民主政治的宣传，使群众认识自己的民主权利是有法律保障的，有党和人民政府保障的，这种权利不容许任何人来剥夺，谁要来剥夺人民的这种权利，就是严重的违法行为。同时要使群众认识：政权干部以至一切干部，都是要服从人民意志、为人民办事的，他们是人民的勤务员，而不是人民的统治者和压迫者。任何干部都要受人民的监督，人民有权选举他们或者撤换他们。只有使人民群众有了这种觉醒，才能把坏分子的劣迹和消极分子的错误、缺点统统揭露出来，以求得彻底的解决。其次，在普选活动的过程中，要特别注意发现能够代表人民意志与要求的先进分子，加意培养他们，使他们在各方面迅速提高，成为能够有效地为人民办事的人材。经过普选，把这些人材选到政权的各个领导岗位上来。普选以后，则应该帮助新的政权组织和干部树立各种必要的工作制度，特别是帮助他们学会运用人民代表大会来了解人民要求，吸收人民意见，布置、检查和推动各项工作，发展互助合作与生产。根据东芦乡的经验，普选以后的这种帮助是十分重要的。否则就会使工作停滞不前。
    这些工作是艰苦的、困难的。但是为了根本改变落后乡村的面貌，使党和人民政府的政策法令和一切工作能够在这些乡村开始贯彻，和人民见面，发挥其力量，把这些乡村的人民组织到社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作中来，迅速推进这种建设和改造工作，我们必须坚决去作，不能有任何推延。
