    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steel Plant Completes February Plan Ahead of Schedule
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steel Plant completed its February production plan three days ahead of schedule on February 25th, exceeding the production plan by 2.3%. By the end of February, the actual monthly production volume was approximately 20% higher than the planned output. The average daily output in February increased by 9.53% compared to the daily output in the fourth quarter of 1953. In terms of product quality, it exceeded the plan by 0.6%, an increase of 1.3% compared to January. The Steel Plant's production situation in February was the best month since it started operations.
    During February, the Steel Plant promoted advanced experiences such as rapid furnace repair and rapid charging, making the production competition a regular occurrence. The average steelmaking time per furnace was shortened by four minutes compared to January. During the Spring Festival, the plant strengthened its propaganda and education work among workers, resulting in an attendance rate of 96.4%, and the average daily production exceeded the plan by 2.7%. At the same time, the daily production report meeting system was implemented, inspecting problems in the day's production and resolving them in a timely manner, thus achieving a production balance rate of 99.65%. The planned steel grade production rate increased to about 85%, more than double that of the same period last year. The plant also strengthened equipment maintenance and repair work, paying attention to protecting the furnace body, resulting in a furnace operation rate of 6.6%, creating a new record since the start of operations. This increased effective operating time by 5.29% compared to January, and the open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient exceeded the national plan by about 10%, greatly increasing steel production. Now, the Steel Plant is deeply mobilizing the masses to further strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work to ensure the overfulfillment of the first quarter's production plan.

    鞍钢炼钢厂提前完成二月份计划
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂在二月二十五日提前三天完成了二月份生产计划，并超过生产计划百分之二点三。到二月底，全月实际生产量约比计划产量提高百分之二十左右。二月份平均日产量比一九五三年第四季度的日产量提高百分之九点五三。在产品质量方面超过计划百分之零点六，比一月份提高百分之一点三。炼钢厂二月份的生产情况，是开工以来最好的一个月份。
    炼钢厂在二月份中推广了快速补炉、快速装料等先进经验，使生产竞赛走向经常化，每炉炼钢时间平均比一月份缩短了四分钟。春节期间，该厂加强了对工人的宣传教育工作，使出勤率达到百分之九十六点四，每日生产量平均超过计划百分之二点七。同时贯彻执行了每日生产汇报会议制度，检查当日生产中的问题，并及时加以解决，因此使生产均衡率达到百分之九十九点六五。按计划钢种生产率提高到百分之八十五左右，比去年同一时期提高一倍以上。该厂还加强了设备维护检修工作，注意保护炉体，使炼炉率达到百分之六点六，创造了开工以来的新纪录，这就使有效作业时间比一月份提高了百分之五点二九，平炉利用系数超过国家计划百分之十左右，大大增加了钢的产量。现在炼钢厂正深入发动群众进一步加强设备维护检修工作，保证超额地完成第一季度生产计划。
