Benxi Iron and Steel Company Begins Establishing Production Regional Management System

    Benxi Iron and Steel Company recently held a meeting of all cadres to deploy the work of establishing a responsibility system with the regional management system and the one-leader system as its content. In the past few years, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has played an important role in ensuring the overfulfillment of national plans by implementing the factory director responsibility system. Last year, through strengthening planning management and establishing and improving various responsibility systems, the company overfulfilled the 1953 national plan. However, there are still many shortcomings in enterprise management, especially the phenomenon of multi-headed leadership and no one being responsible in the workshop processing sections. According to the requirements of the national general line, Benxi Iron and Steel Company's five-year construction plan must be carried out ahead of schedule, and the task is more arduous and difficult. If the level of enterprise management is not improved, it will be impossible to complete this arduous and difficult task. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to establish a four-level one-leader system centered on the company manager, factory/mine director (engineering company manager), workshop director (construction site director), and foreman, according to the principle of the production regional management system. Correspondingly adjust functional organizations, clarify responsibilities, establish a functional personnel responsibility system, and establish a worker post responsibility system among workers.
    Ren Zhiyuan, Second Secretary of the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a mobilization report at the meeting. He emphasized: The regional management system and the one-leader system are one of the basic principles of socialist enterprise management. Learning from the experience of Soviet socialist construction and establishing a regional management system and a one-leader system within our enterprises is an important measure to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, it is work with the nature of basic construction within our enterprise, a meticulous organizational work and in-depth ideological education work. He called on the Party, the administration, the trade union and the Communist Youth League to unite and resolutely do a good job in establishing the regional management system and the one-leader system, so as to improve the level of enterprise management and ensure the comprehensive, balanced and safe overfulfillment of the national plan. Finally, the coking workshop introduced their experience in establishing and implementing the regional management system and the one-leader system.
    Before specifically deploying the establishment and implementation of the regional management system and the one-leader system, Benxi Iron and Steel Company had made necessary preparations. In late December last year, the Benxi Municipal Committee, the Iron and Steel Company, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly organized a working group to conduct pilot projects in the coking workshop to create experience. Since the beginning of January this year, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has continuously issued eleven kinds of relevant learning materials for various units to organize learning. In mid-January, Benxi Iron and Steel Company also held training courses for key members in rotation. In two phases, more than 500 section chiefs, workshop directors, foremen, and engineer-level cadres were selected for concentrated study, which prepared favorable conditions for carrying out the work of establishing and implementing the regional management system and the one-leader system.

    本溪钢铁公司开始建立生产区域管理制
    本溪钢铁公司最近召开全体干部会议，部署了建立和贯彻以区域管理制和一长制为内容的建立责任制工作。本溪钢铁公司在过去几年中，由于实行厂长负责制，对保证超额完成国家计划起了重要作用。去年，又经过加强计划管理，建立和健全各种责任制度，超额完成一九五三年的国家计划。但在企业管理上至今仍有许多缺点，特别是在车间加工段还存在着多头领导和无人负责现象。根据国家总路线要求，本溪钢铁公司的五年建设计划要提前进行，任务更为繁重和艰巨，如果不把企业管理水平提高一步，就无法完成这项繁重而艰巨的任务。因此，会议指出，必须根据生产区域管理制的原则，以建立公司经理、厂矿长（工程公司经理）、车间主任（工地主任）、工长等四级一长制为中心，相应地调整职能机构、明确职责、建立职能人员专责制，在工人中建立工人岗位责任制。
    中共本溪市委第二书记任志远在会上作了动员报告。他强调指出：区域管理制和一长制是社会主义企业管理的基本原则之一，学习苏联社会主义建设经验，在我们的企业内部建立区域管理制和一长制，是加速国家社会主义工业化的重要措施。因之它在我们企业内部是带有基本建设性质的工作，是一项细致的组织工作和深入的思想教育工作。他号召党、行政、工会和青年团，必须团结一致，坚决把建立区域管理制和一长制的工作搞好，以提高企业管理水平，保证全面、均衡、安全地超额完成国家计划。会议最后由炼焦车间介绍了他们在建立和贯彻区域管理制和一长制当中所取得的经验。
    在这次具体部署建立和贯彻区域管理制和一长制之前，本溪钢铁公司曾经作了必要的准备工作。在去年十二月下旬，本溪市委、钢铁公司和市工会联合会，就组织了工作组在炼焦车间试点，创造经验。从今年一月上旬开始，本溪钢铁公司曾连续印发了十一种有关学习材料，供给各单位组织学习。一月中旬本溪钢铁公司又举办了骨干分子轮训班，前后两期曾抽调五百多名科长、车间主任、工长和工程师一级干部集中学习，给这次开展建立和贯彻区域管理制和一长制工作准备了有利条件。
