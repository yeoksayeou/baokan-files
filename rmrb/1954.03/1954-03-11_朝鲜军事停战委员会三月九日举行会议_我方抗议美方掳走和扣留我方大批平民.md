Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 10th. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on March 9th, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, strongly protested the US side's thorough violation of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement by once again abducting large numbers of civilians from our rear coastal islands after the armistice and forcibly detaining our civilians, preventing them from returning to their hometowns.

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out: When the US side suffered successive defeats retreating from our areas in the winter of 1950, they abducted large numbers of our civilians. To give these civilians the opportunity to return to their hometowns, Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement made clear provisions. However, after the armistice, the US side blatantly violated this provision, and when withdrawing from our rear coastal islands, they abducted another large number of our civilians. Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement clearly tasked the US side with assisting our civilians in returning to their hometowns, but the US-South Korean government, through all kinds of obstruction and persecution, forcibly detained our civilians, preventing them from returning to their hometowns. On February 18th, the US side notified us that it was only prepared to assist 70 of our civilians in returning to their hometowns. On February 27th, the US side even openly stated that it would forcibly detain 44 of these 70 civilians. On February 28th, the US-South Korean government openly detained two more people. Although the US side later supplemented this with thirteen people, as of now, out of the displaced civilians abducted by the US side, which the US side itself claims number up to two million, only 37 have been able to return to our side.

The civilians who have returned this time have provided many irrefutable facts, fully exposing the US side's so-called "displaced persons registration," "assisting displaced persons to return to their hometowns," etc., as nothing more than deceptive tricks. Before the so-called "registration," South Korean secret agents and police carried out various threats against our displaced civilians, even intimidating them by saying that those who requested to return home would be detained and shot by local authorities. In fact, even a spokesman for the US military's "Korean Civil Assistance Command" publicly admitted on February 27th that our displaced civilians did not dare to register. As for the civilians who braved great danger to register, they were subjected to various obstructions and persecutions by South Korean police and secret agents. One of our displaced civilians in Busan who registered to return home was dragged from his house in the middle of the night and beaten into a cripple by secret agents after registering. Two of our displaced civilians in Busan, Zhu Quanzhe and Zhu Shengjin, after registering, the US side fabricated so-called statements by the two of them claiming they had withdrawn their registration and did not want to return home, publishing it in the local newspaper, using this despicable method to deprive them of their right to return to our side. The US side even deliberately concealed the assembly point and the date of departure north from our displaced civilians who had registered to return home, preventing them from making the trip. In short, the US side used all kinds of shameless means to deprive the tens of thousands of our civilians who eagerly hoped to return to their hometowns of their right and opportunity to do so. According to reports from our returning civilians, in just a few places in Gyeongsangnam-do, which they actually knew about, more than 1,100 civilians had taken the risk of registering, but so far only a few individuals have been able to return home.

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho also specifically pointed out at the meeting: It has been confirmed that Lu Yongri and Yin Longcheng, the two people detained by the US side on February 28th, were formerly our captured personnel who had been forcibly detained by the US side under the guise of "release." Their names were on the list of prisoners of war that the US side handed over to us during the armistice negotiations. Their detention numbers in the US prisoner of war camps were 203737 and 200368. Their registration and demand to return home this time, despite the persecution and threats from the US side, once again forcefully exposes the US side's fabrication of the so-called "unwillingness to repatriate" of our captured personnel. Furthermore, the US side's re-detention of them this time fully proves that the US side is not only violating the agreement on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, but also on the issue of assisting civilians in returning to their hometowns.

At the meeting, the US side not only failed to provide any explanation for the above-mentioned specific facts listed by Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, but even flatly denied them and launched a counter-attack, and finally even changed the subject in an attempt to evade the issue. Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out on the spot: Any sophistry, denial, or slander by the US side can never overturn the ironclad facts of its violation of the Armistice Agreement and forcible detention of our civilians, nor can it help the US side escape the serious responsibility it should bear for this.

Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho finally firmly demanded that the US side: immediately provide a responsible explanation for the 44 of our civilians detained on February 27th and the two of our captured personnel detained on February 28th, send back all of our civilians abducted from our rear coastal islands after the armistice, and earnestly implement the provisions of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement so that our civilians currently in the other side's area have the freedom, opportunity, and right to return to their hometowns.

    朝鲜军事停战委员会三月九日举行会议
    我方抗议美方掳走和扣留我方大批平民
    【新华社开城十日电】在三月九日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将严重抗议美方彻底违反停战协定第五十九款在停战后自我方后方沿海岛屿再一次掳走大批平民并强迫扣留我方平民阻止他们返乡等罪行。
    李相朝中将指出：美方在一九五○年冬自我方地区节节败退时曾掳走大批我方的平民，为了使平民有返乡的机会，停战协定第五十九款作了明确的规定，但停战后美方公然违反这一规定，在撤出我方后方沿海岛屿时又掳走大批我方平民。停战协定第五十九款明确责成美方负责协助我方的平民返乡，但美方南朝鲜政府却以百般的阻挠与迫害强迫扣留我方的平民，阻止他们返乡。美方在二月十八日通知我方称：它仅准备协助七十名我方平民返乡，到二月二十七日美方更公然表示要强迫扣留这七十名中的四十四名平民，二十八日美方南朝鲜政府又公然扣留了两名。虽然美方后来又补送了十三名，但截至目前为止被美方掳走而据美方自称数达二百万的我方失所平民中只有三十七人得以回到我方。
    此次返乡的我方平民提供了许多无可辩驳的事实，充分揭露了美方所谓“失所平民登记”“协助失所平民返乡”等等完全是骗人的把戏。在所谓“登记”前，南朝鲜的特务与警察对我方失所平民进行各种威胁，甚至恫吓称：要求回家的人要被当地机关扣押枪毙。事实上连美军“朝鲜民政辅导处”的发言人在二月二十七日也公开承认我方失所平民并不敢前往登记，至于冒着重大危险前往登记的平民又受到南朝鲜警察和特务的各种阻挠与迫害，釜山一名登记返乡的我方平民在登记后被特务半夜关入家中打成残废，釜山二名我方失所平民朱权哲与朱生今前往登记后，美方竟捏造他们两人所谓撤销登记不愿返乡的声明登在当地报纸上，用这种卑鄙的办法剥夺他们回到我方的权利。美方甚至蓄意对已登记返乡的我方失所平民隐瞒集合地点与出发北上的日期，使他们不能成行。总之美方就是用种种无耻的手段使千千万万切望返乡的我方平民被剥夺了返乡的权利与机会。据回来的我方平民报告，仅仅就他们所确实知道的在庆尚南道几个地方就有一千一百多名平民冒险进行过登记，但至今只有个别平民得以返乡。
    李相朝中将在会上并特别指出：二月二十八日被美方扣下的两人卢永日与尹龙成已经证实是以前被美方在“释放”的名义下强迫扣留的我方被俘人员，美方在停战谈判期间交给我方的战俘名单里就有他们的名字，他们在美方战俘营中的拘留编号是二○三七三七和二○○三六八。他们此次不顾美方的迫害与威胁进行登记要求返乡，这就又一次有力地揭穿了美方捏造的所谓我方被俘人员“不愿遣返”的鬼话，而美方此次再度将他们扣留，更充分证明美方不仅在战俘遣返问题上违反协议，而在协助平民返乡的问题上也是如此。
    美方在会上对李相朝中将所列举的上述各项具体事实，不仅未作任何交代，而竟一口抵赖并进行反噬，最后甚至转换话题以企图逃避。李相朝中将当场指出：美方的任何狡辩抵赖、造谣诬蔑都绝不能推翻其违反停战协定、强迫扣留我方平民的铁的事实，更绝不能帮助美方逃脱其对此所应负的严重责任。
    李相朝中将最后坚决要求美方：立即对它二月二十七日所扣留的四十四名我方平民与二月二十八日所扣留的二名我方被俘人员作出负责的交代，送回停战后自我方后方沿海岛屿掳走的全部我方平民，并切实履行停战协定第五十九款的规定，使现在对方地区的我方平民均有返乡的自由、机会与权利。
