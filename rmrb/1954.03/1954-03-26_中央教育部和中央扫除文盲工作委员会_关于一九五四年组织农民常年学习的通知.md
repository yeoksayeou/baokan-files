    In order to adapt to the requirements of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and on the basis of the development of mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas and agricultural production, gradually improving the socialist consciousness and cultural level of farmers is an important and regular task in rural areas in the future. Last year, during the winter schools in various regions, the general line was publicized and educated to the vast number of farmers, which promoted grain purchase, mutual aid and cooperation, winter production, and other work, and organized farmers' cultural learning. Currently, spring plowing is approaching, and winter schools are about to end. According to surveys in various regions and past experience, after spring plowing, some farmers can still engage in year-round spare-time learning. On the basis of winter schools, various regions should actively organize farmers who have the conditions for learning to continue learning during production breaks, based on the specific situation. The main issues in this work are hereby notified as follows:

    1. Organizing farmers to engage in year-round spare-time learning should propose different requirements according to different objects. The minimum requirement is to review old lessons and consolidate the cultural learning achievements during the winter school period so as not to "relapse." For farmers with better learning conditions, new lessons should be taught on the basis of consolidating the winter school achievements to further improve them.

    At the end of this year's winter school, many students will reach the non-illiterate standard. Various regions should pay attention to consolidating their literacy achievements and improving their literacy skills to prevent them from returning to illiteracy. Therefore, it is necessary to closely cooperate with relevant parties and adopt various effective methods to actively organize them to participate in various rural cultural activities, and through cultural activities such as libraries, reading groups, blackboards, and cultural entertainment, carry out consolidation and improvement. Or organize them to serve as literacy teachers and counselors, so that they gradually become the force for eliminating illiteracy in rural areas. For those who have the conditions and are willing to continue learning, actively organize them to continue learning in order to improve their cultural level. The curriculum shall be determined by various regions according to the needs of the students and the conditions of the teachers.

    2. Organizing farmers' learning must adapt to rural production conditions, and various forms should be adopted according to different objects and different requirements. Those who can study in a concentrated manner can organize year-round people's schools for centralized teaching. According to the busy and slack seasons of farming, if necessary, it can also be combined with decentralized group learning. The amount of teaching should not be too heavy, and the learning time should not be too long. Holidays should be given during important farming seasons such as summer harvest and autumn harvest. Those who cannot study in a concentrated manner can conduct group learning and individual self-study according to their distance from residence and production organization. The study time should be flexible, and concentrated inspections and guidance can be selected at a certain time. Organizing the masses to study must be based on the principle of voluntariness, and there must be no coercion or orders or hindering of production, but it is also necessary to actively carry out organization and mobilization to prevent the phenomenon of laissez-faire. Regarding the issue of objects, special attention should still be paid to organizing village and township cadres and activists to participate in learning, and to find ways to solve their learning difficulties. Attention should be paid to the production of spare-time teachers.

    3. Political education should be conducted regularly in people's schools. The content of political education: focus on publicizing the general line of the country during the transition period, educating farmers to organize, developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, improving agricultural technology, and improving agricultural production; and strengthening the education of the worker-peasant alliance and resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea. The specific content shall be appropriately stipulated by various regions according to the central work and mass needs at that time and place. Various regions should conscientiously summarize the experience of publicizing the general line to farmers in winter schools, so that the political education of people's schools can be improved. It is recommended that local CCP committees select appropriate personnel to serve as political teachers, and provide them with political teaching materials in a timely manner and review their teaching content. The teaching time of political classes shall be determined by various regions. In addition to the students of people's schools, the general public can be absorbed to attend classes.

    4. Education administrative departments and illiteracy elimination work committees at all levels must, under the unified leadership of the CCP committees and the people's governments, conscientiously summarize the winter school work and obtain a more systematic experience in farmers' cultural learning, which is of great significance for improving the future rural illiteracy elimination work and improving farmers' cultural level in a step-by-step manner. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the specific leadership of the people's school work and conduct regular inspections and guidance. Various regions should report the summary of winter schools and the deployment of people's schools to the Central Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee by the end of May this year.

    中央教育部和中央扫除文盲工作委员会
    关于一九五四年组织农民常年学习的通知
    为了适应农业社会主义改造的要求，在农村互助合作和农业生产发展的基础上，逐步提高农民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，是今后农村中的一项重要的经常工作。去年在各地冬学中向广大农民进行了总路线的宣传教育，推动了粮食收购、互助合作、冬季生产等工作，并组织了农民的文化学习。目前春耕将到，冬学行将结束，根据各地调查和历年经验证明，春耕之后仍有部分农民可以进行常年业余学习。各地应在冬学的基础上，根据具体情况，积极组织有条件学习的农民利用生产空闲继续学习。兹将这一工作中几项主要问题，通知如下：
    一、组织农民进行常年业余学习，应根据不同对象，提出不同要求。最低要求是温习旧课，巩固冬学期间的文化学习成果，使其不致“回生”。对那些学习条件较好的农民，则应在巩固冬学成绩的基础上教学新课，进一步予以提高。
    今年冬学结束时，将有不少学员达到非文盲标准，各地应注意巩固他们的识字成果，并提高他们的读写能力，防止他们又回到文盲状态。因此，应和有关方面密切配合，采取各种有效办法，积极组织他们参加农村各种文化生活，通过图书室、读报组、黑板报、文化娱乐等文化活动，进行巩固提高。或组织他们担任扫盲教师、辅导员，使其逐渐成为农村扫除文盲工作的力量。对其中有条件和愿意继续学习的人，要积极组织他们继续学习，以提高他们的文化水平，课程暂由各地根据学员需要和教师条件自行规定。
    二、组织农民学习，必须适应农村生产情况，根据不同对象，不同要求，采用各种形式进行。凡可以集中学习的人，可组织常年民校进行集中教学，根据农事忙闲情况，必要时也可和分散的小组学习配合进行。平时教学分量不宜过重，学习时间不宜过多。在夏收、秋收等重要农忙季节应予放假。不能集中学习的人，可根据其居住远近和生产组织等情况，进行小组学习和个人自学，学习时间，应有伸缩性，并可选择一定时间进行集中的检查和指导。组织群众学习须根据自愿原则，不得强迫命令和妨碍生产，但也必须积极地进行组织动员，防止放任自流的现象。关于对象问题，仍要特别注意组织乡村干部、积极分子参加学习，并设法解决他们学习上的困难。对业余教师的使用应注意照顾其生产。
    三、在民校中要经常进行政治教育。政治教育的内容：要围绕着宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线，教育农民组织起来，发展互助合作运动，改进农业技术，提高农业生产；并加强工农联盟和抗美援朝的教育，具体内容由各地根据当时当地的中心工作和群众需要作适当规定。各地应认真总结冬学中向农民宣传总路线的经验，使民校的政治教育有所改进。政治教师，建议由当地中共党委选择适当人员担任，并及时供给其政治教材，审查其教学内容。政治课的教学时间，由各地自行规定。上课时除民校学员外，可吸收一般群众听课。
    四、各级教育行政部门和扫除文盲工作委员会，必须在中共党委和人民政府统一领导下，认真总结冬学工作，取得农民文化学习比较系统的经验，这对改进今后农村扫除文盲工作和有步骤地提高农民文化水平，有重要的意义。同时，必须加强对民校工作的具体领导，经常进行检查和指导。各地应将冬学总结和民校布置情况，一并于今年五月底报告中央扫除文盲工作委员会。
