Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the entire families of martyrs and military dependents of the Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaoshanggou Village, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, are excited to report to you: Since joining the agricultural cooperative, our lives have greatly improved with the increase in production. In 1953, our average income was 6.8 shi of grain per person, an increase of 3.8 shi compared to 1951. All twenty-three households have enough to eat and wear, and eighteen of them even have surplus grain.

Our lives are more prosperous than in the past, but how did we embark on this path to prosperity? Let us report to you: In 1951, our village piloted an agricultural cooperative. The crops of the agricultural cooperative grew particularly well, and the income of all twenty-one cooperative members increased. We recognized the benefits of the agricultural cooperative and actively requested to join. However, the cooperative distributed income mainly based on labor power, and fifteen of our households had no labor power. How could we guarantee an increase in income? Cooperative Chairman Wang Jinyun and village cadres discussed this many times and decided to treat the work of substituting labor that should be borne by the masses as the workdays of the households receiving substituted labor. In this way, the problem was solved, and all twenty-three of our households joined the cooperative in the spring of 1952. After joining, the cooperative also assigned appropriate work to those of us who could not participate in labor in the past. For example, Zhang Yinchun, who is sixty-seven years old, could not work independently before joining the cooperative. The cooperative systematically assigned him various light tasks. As a result, his income increased. In the past, he did not have enough grain to eat, but last year he sold 2.5 shi of surplus grain to the state. Zhang Li'er is a sixteen-year-old girl. The cooperative arranged for her to do tasks such as picking cotton and taught her techniques such as weeding seedlings. She completed sixty-three workdays throughout the year, earning 5.3 shi of grain and 60,000 yuan of sideline income, which was more than when she relied solely on substituted labor in the past. Among us, fourteen people who could not work or could only do very little work in the past are now regularly assigned appropriate work after joining the cooperative. Last year, each of them completed 50 to 120 workdays.

The cooperative members care for and take care of us in all aspects. For example, some families of martyrs and military dependents had financial difficulties when joining the cooperative, so the cooperative members decided to exempt them from part of their investment. Wang Guifa's mother's house collapsed last year, and all the cooperative members automatically helped to rebuild it. Zhang Shengyuan (who lives alone) fell seriously ill last July. Cooperative member Zhang Qingxiu and others automatically invited a doctor and obtained medicine for him, and nine female cooperative members, including Liang Xiuyun, automatically took turns to serve him soup and medicine, taking care of him very diligently. When accumulating coal last winter, the cooperative members first accumulated thirty dan of coal for the fifteen families of martyrs and military dependents who had no labor power. The help and care that village cadres and the villagers give us also make us feel indescribably happy and joyful.

Chairman Mao, our ability to obtain such happiness is inseparable from your wise leadership. We will use practical actions to repay your concern for us. We guarantee to you that we will follow your instructions, "carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory," and continue to actively participate in labor, resolutely not relying solely on substituted labor. We will further unite with all cooperative members, do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, and run the agricultural cooperative even better, working together under the illumination of the general line to achieve socialism at an early date. Before the Spring Festival, we have already sent letters to our relatives in the army, telling them about the production and living conditions at home, and encouraging them to make a hundredfold effort to consolidate national defense, defend the construction of the motherland, and protect the happiness of the people.

    王锦云农业生产合作社二十三户烈属、军属写信
    向毛主席保证积极参加劳动争取更大光荣敬爱的毛主席：
    我们山西武乡县窑上沟村王锦云农业生产合作社的全体烈属、军属，兴奋地向您报告：参加了农业社以后，随着生产的提高，我们的生活也大大改善了。一九五三年我们每人平均收入六石八斗粮，比一九五一年增加了三石八斗；二十三户家家够吃够穿，其中十八户还有了余粮。
    我们的生活比过去富裕了，可是我们怎样才走上这富裕道路呢？我们向您报告一下：一九五一年，我村试办了农业社。农业社的庄稼长的特别好，二十一户社员都增加了收入。我们认识了农业社的好处，积极要求参加。但是，社里是以劳动力为主进行分配的，我们有十五户没有劳动力，怎能保证收入增加呢。社长王锦云和村干部多次讨论，决定把群众应负担的代耕工作为受代耕户的劳动日。这样问题解决了，我们二十三户在一九五二年春全入了社。入社后，社里又给我们过去不能参加劳动的人分配了适当的工作。如六十七岁的张银春入社前不能独立劳动，社里就有计划地给他分配各种轻活；他的收入因而增加了，往年粮食不够吃，去年还卖给国家两石五斗余粮。张梨儿是个十六岁的女孩，社里就让她作摘棉花等活，又教会她锄苗等技术。她全年做到六十三个劳动日，比往年单靠代耕时多得了五石三斗粮和六万元的副业收入。我们中间，有十四个过去不能劳动或只能干很少活的，入社后经常能分配到适当的工作，去年每人做了五十至一百二十个劳动日。
    社员们在各方面都关心和照顾我们。如有些烈属、军属入社时经济情况困难，社员们就决定免除了他们一部分投资。王贵法的母亲家里去年窑房倒塌了，全体社员自动帮助修建。张生元（家里只他一个人）去年七月害了大病，社员张清秀等自动为他请医生、抓药，梁秀云等九个女社员自动轮流替他端汤熬药，照顾得非常殷勤。去冬开始积煤时，社员们先给十五户无劳力的烈属、军属积了三十担煤。村干部和全村群众对我们的帮助和爱护，也使我们感到说不尽的愉快和高兴。
    毛主席，我们能够得到这样的幸福，是和您的英明领导分不开的。我们要用实际行动来答谢您对我们的关心。我们向您保证，一定遵照您的指示，“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，继续积极参加劳动，决不单纯依靠代耕。我们要和全体社员更进一步地团结一致，做好增产节约，并把农业社办得更好，在总路线照耀下共同为早日实现社会主义而努力。在春节前，我们已给在部队中的亲人去信，告给他们家中的生产和生活情况，鼓励他们为巩固国防、保卫祖国建设和人民幸福而百倍地努力。
