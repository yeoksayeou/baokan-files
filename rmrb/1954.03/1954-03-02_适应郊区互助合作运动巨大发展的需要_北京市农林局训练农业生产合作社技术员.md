To Adapt to the Needs of the Huge Development of the Suburban Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement:
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry Trains Agricultural Production Cooperative Technicians

    In recent months, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the suburbs of Beijing has undergone tremendous development. To date, 259 new cooperatives have been established, and 53 old cooperatives have been strengthened, with a total of 11 large cooperatives with more than 100 households. In order to adapt to the needs of the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the suburbs, and to lay the foundation for systematically training agricultural technicians for agricultural production cooperatives in the future, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry began to hold a training class for agricultural production cooperative technicians on February 8th, to conduct basic production science knowledge training. A total of 354 technicians were selected from 295 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs to participate, and the Nanyuan Red Star Collective Farm also sent 10 technicians, along with 393 cadres from the districts who participated in the study.
    After ten days of study, the technicians have initially understood basic production science knowledge such as fertilization, close planting, pest and disease control, and livestock feeding management, and have corrected some conservative ideas and misconceptions.
    From the study, the students all realized the importance of production technology. Especially after listening to the report on the General Line and watching movies such as "Light Shines on Ke'erdi Village," their enthusiasm for learning was even higher. Many students wrote letters to their cooperatives during their studies, telling them what they had learned, and making suggestions for production improvements based on what they had learned.
    At the end of the study, they all expressed that they would apply what they had learned to production when they returned to their cooperatives. After the technicians of Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative returned to the cooperative, they immediately reported the learning situation and gains to the cooperative, and proposed to promptly compact the land, conserve soil moisture, and harrow the wheat fields in order to strive for increased wheat production. When the five technicians from Liu Changling Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaohongmen, Nanyuan District, returned to the cooperative, they arrived just in time for the cooperative to revise its annual production plan. They immediately applied what they had learned and put forward revision suggestions. Under their promotion, the cooperative's field crops land was promptly compacted to conserve soil moisture.

    适应郊区互助合作运动巨大发展的需要
    北京市农林局训练农业生产合作社技术员
    北京市郊区的互助合作运动，近几月中有了巨大的发展。到目前为止，已建立新社二百五十九个，五十三个老社也有了壮大，百户以上的大社共有十一个。北京市农林局为了适应郊区互助合作运动发展的需要，并给今后系统地培养农业生产合作社的农业技术人员打下基础，从二月八日开始举办农业生产合作社技术人员训练班，进行基本的生产科学知识训练。郊区共有二百九十五个农业生产合作社选派了三百五十四名技术员参加，南苑红星集体农庄也派来十名技术员，连同参加学习的区里干部共是三百九十三名。
    经过十天时间的学习，技术员们初步懂得了施肥、密植、病虫害防治、牲畜饲养管理等基本的生产科学知识，纠正了某些保守思想和错误看法。
    从学习中，学员们都认识到生产技术的重要，尤其是在听了总路线报告与看了“光明照耀到克奥尔地村”等电影以后，他们的学习情绪更高。很多学员在学习当中便给社里写信，把自己学的东西告诉社里，并根据自己学会的东西向社里提出生产上的改进意见。
    在学习结束时，他们都表示回到社里要把学会的东西用到生产上去。张郭庄农业生产合作社的技术员们回到社里后，马上向社里汇报学习情况与收获，并提出要及时压地、保墒，耙麦地，争取小麦增产。南苑区小红门刘长龄农业生产合作社的五个技术员回到社里时，正赶上社里修订全年生产计划，他们马上把学的东西运用起来，提出了修正意见。在他们推动下，社里的大田作物地及时地进行了压地保墒。（董四留）
