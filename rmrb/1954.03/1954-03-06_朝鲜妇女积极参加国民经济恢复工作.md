Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 5th: Korean women have become a powerful construction force in the post-war national economic recovery and construction.

After the armistice, Korean women enthusiastically responded to the call of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Democratic Women's League, actively going to factories, mines, and construction sites to participate in the reconstruction of the motherland. According to incomplete statistics, in the two months after the armistice, more than 10,000 women in South Pyongan Province alone entered the production sector to work; in North Hamgyong Province, more than 3,800 women participated in work at the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, the Chongjin Steel Refining Factory, and the Chongjin Construction Enterprise. A large number of women participated in urban reconstruction work. In the first month after the armistice, a total of 130,000 women in Pyongyang participated in the Stalin Street renovation project. Women in Wonsan contributed hundreds of thousands of workdays to rush repairs of damaged railways, roads, bridges, and to clear rubble and fill bomb craters in the urban area. In the countryside, women intensified their efforts to restore damaged farmland and water conservancy facilities, universally participating in plowing, sowing, and other labor, and actively learning techniques such as using plows and new-style agricultural tools.

Korean women have already created many new records in the recovery and construction work. Kim Tae-jung, a female worker at the Nampo New Textile Factory, and more than 130 others actively learned technology and quickly became skilled workers, completing 120 to 130 percent of their production tasks. A large number of female lathe operators and female workers in the casting workshop of a certain factory completed more than 150 to 190 percent of their production tasks in February of this year. Li Young-sook, a female handloom worker at the Sinuiju Silkworm Silk Factory, enthusiastically participated in the production increase movement throughout last year, completing her annual plan of weaving more than 10,000 meters of silk twenty-three days ahead of schedule, and later increased production by 600 meters of silk fabrics. Shin Chun-sil, a female worker at the Taesong Pottery Factory, created a new bricklaying method, laying an average of 2,000 bricks per day, increasing work efficiency by one and a half times; she also taught 180 female workers to use the new bricklaying method, which promoted the progress of the construction project and enabled the timely completion of the brick kiln construction project, which then began production. When the Wonsan Railway Section lacked materials for repairing railway lines, more than 200 women in the railway section used their rest time to go out and collect waste materials, collecting waste materials and scrap iron worth 280,000 Korean won in one week, which solved a major difficulty. Kim Chun-eun, the production team leader of a certain state-owned farm, and her 55 female companions intensified their work under extremely difficult conditions before and after the Korean armistice, fertilizing nearly 900 tons of fertilizer on 43 hectares of rice fields, resulting in a harvest of 4.45 tons of rice per hectare, exceeding the original planned output by 46 percent.

    朝鲜妇女积极参加国民经济恢复工作
    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜妇女在战后国民经济恢复建设中已成为一支有力的建设大军。
    停战以后，朝鲜妇女热烈响应金日成元帅及民主妇女同盟的号召，踊跃走到工厂、矿山和建设工地，积极参加祖国的重建工作。据不完全的统计，在停战后的两个月中，仅平安南道就有一万多个妇女进入生产部门工作；在咸镜北道，仅参加金策制铁所、城津炼钢厂和清津建设事业所工作的妇女就有三千八百多人。大批的妇女参加了城市重建工作。停战后的第一个月，参加斯大林大街整理工程的平壤市妇女总计有十三万人。元山市妇女出了数十万个工，参加赶修市区被破坏的铁道、马路、桥梁和清理废墟、填平弹坑等工作。在农村中，妇女们加紧恢复着被破坏的农田和水利设施，普遍参加耕地、播种等劳动，而且积极学习扶犁和使用新式农具等技术。
    朝鲜妇女在恢复建设工作中已经创造了许多新纪录。南浦市新到工厂工作的女工金台重等一百三十多人，积极学习技术，都很快地成了熟练工人，完成生产任务百分之一百二十到三十。某工厂的大批女镟盘工和铸造车间的女工们，在今年二月份已完成生产任务百分之一百五十到九十以上。新义州柞蚕丝工厂手织机女工李英淑，在去年一年中热烈参加增产运动，提前二十三天完成了织绢一万多公尺的全年计划，后来又增产了六百公尺的绢织物。大成窑业工厂女工申春实创造新砌砖法，平均每天砌砖两千块，提高工作效率一倍半；她并教会一百八十名女工使用新砌砖法，推进了建设工程的进展，使砖窑建筑工程得以及时竣工，开始生产。元山市机务段在修补铁道线路缺乏器材时，机务段的二百多名妇女利用休息时间外出搜集废料，在一星期中就搜集到价值朝鲜币二十八万圆的废料和废铁，解决了很大的困难。某国营农场生产组长金春银和她的五十五位女同伴，在朝鲜停战前后十分艰苦困难的条件下，加紧工作，在四十三公顷的稻田里施肥近九百吨，使得每公顷稻田收获稻子四吨四十五公斤，超过原计划产量百分之四十六。
