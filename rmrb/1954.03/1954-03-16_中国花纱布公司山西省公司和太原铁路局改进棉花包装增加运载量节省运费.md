China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Shanxi Provincial Company and Taiyuan Railway Bureau employees, through joint research in increasing production and practicing economy, have improved the cotton baling machine and cotton packing methods, increasing the weight of cotton bales and the loading capacity of trains, greatly saving on railcars and freight costs.

After the cotton baling machine was improved, the weight of cotton bales increased from 225 kilograms per cubic meter to 335 kilograms, an increase of 48.99%; the volume of cotton was reduced by 38.99%, and the loading capacity of wide-gauge railcars increased from the original 16.94 tons to 27 tons; narrow-gauge railcars increased from the original 10.45 tons to 17 tons, an increase in loading capacity of 62%. This can save the state 2,000 railcars and over 3.9 billion yuan in freight costs annually.

In order to promote this advanced experience, the Shanxi Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the Taiyuan Railway Bureau held a demonstration meeting in Yuci County on March 9, inviting cotton yarn and cloth companies and railway bureaus from various provinces to visit. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government also sent people to participate.

    中国花纱布公司山西省公司和太原铁路局改进棉花包装增加运载 量节省运费
    中国花纱布公司山西省公司和太原铁路局职工，在增产节约中共同研究改进了棉花榨包机和棉花装箱，提高棉花包重量和火车装载量，大大节省了车皮和运费。
    改进了棉花榨包机以后，棉花包重由每立方公尺二百二十五公斤，增加到三百三十五公斤，提高百分之四十八点九九；棉花的体积缩小了百分之三十八点九九，宽轨车皮的装载量由原装十六点九四吨增加到二十七吨；窄轨车皮由原装十点四五吨提高到十七吨，装载量提高了百分之六十二。全年可给国家节省两千个车皮和三十九亿余元的运费。
    为了推广这一先进经验，山西省花纱布公司和太原铁路局，于三月九日在榆次县召开示范会议，邀请各省花纱布公司和铁路局参观。中央人民政府铁道部和中央人民政府商业部也派了人去参加。
