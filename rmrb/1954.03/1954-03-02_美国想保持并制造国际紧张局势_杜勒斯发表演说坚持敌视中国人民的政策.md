Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's radio address on February 24 regarding the Berlin Conference exposed the fact that the U.S. ruling clique still wants to maintain and create international tension.

While the world welcomes the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference to negotiate the resolution of international disputes, Dulles, in his speech, made no attempt to conceal the U.S. ruling clique's intention to continue its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people. Dulles pretended to forget the fact that the U.S. was driven back to the 38th parallel by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war of aggression against Korea, and pretended not to know the world's criticism of the U.S.'s unreasonable sabotage of the talks. Puffed up with pride, he claimed that China "came to Geneva not to receive our courtesy, but to appear before the court of world opinion to defend itself." In order to turn the Geneva Conference into a place for creating tension, Dulles attempted to play the role of "plaintiff" at this conference, so that the United States could block the path of peaceful negotiation. Dulles's attitude clearly shows that although the United States, under the pressure of the world's people demanding peaceful negotiation, had to agree to hold the Geneva Conference, the United States has a deep fear of resolving disputes through negotiation.

After the Berlin Conference, public opinion in Asian and European countries with different tendencies generally welcomed the holding of the Geneva Conference, and particularly pointed out that the participation of the People's Republic of China is a new stage in international relations, which provides favorable conditions for resolving urgent international problems and easing tensions in Asia and the world. However, the U.S. reactionary clique's plan is something else. They are only concerned with maintaining and deepening international tension. Certain U.S. congressmen and newspapers, just after the end of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, began a propaganda campaign, trying their best to say that the Geneva Conference has a "gloomy future" and will not achieve anything. For example, the "New York Times" clearly asked its readers in an editorial not to "have too much hope for the outcome of this conference." The dissemination of pessimistic air by U.S. propaganda organs is ill-intentioned.

However, Dulles's conspiracy did not succeed in the past, and it will not be satisfactory in the future. In his radio address, Dulles said that whether the Geneva Conference can resolve the Korean and Indochina issues depends on whether China is "willing" to do so, but Dulles cannot make the peace-loving people of the world believe that it is China, not the United States, that is invading Korea and Indochina. Who launched the war of aggression in Korea? Who has been constantly complicating the resolution of the Korean issue after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and has been creating a stalemate to obstruct the convening of the Korean political conference? Who is driving France to continue its war of aggression in Indochina, and is actively interfering and openly opposing the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue? Who is creating and maintaining tension in Asia, setting up military bases everywhere, and arousing the anger and opposition of the broad masses of the people? If the United States is unwilling to respect the peaceful will of the Asian people to resolve problems at the Geneva Conference, it will not be able to escape being judged by world opinion. This is what Dulles, who wants to treat China as the "defendant," should pay attention to.

China's consistent policy is to insist on a peaceful resolution of the Korean and Indochina issues. China's peaceful policy and China's important role in resolving major international issues are increasingly supported and endorsed by the people of Asia and the world. Dulles's attempt to slander China and block the path to peace using old methods will not be successful.

### 美国想保持并制造国际紧张局势  杜勒斯发表演说坚持敌视中国人民的政策

    美国想保持并制造国际紧张局势
    杜勒斯发表演说坚持敌视中国人民的政策
    【新华社二十八日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯二月二十四日发表的关于柏林会议情况的广播演说，暴露了美国统治集团还是想保持并制造国际紧张局势。
    举世正在欢迎有中华人民共和国参加的日内瓦会议来协商解决国际争端，但杜勒斯却在演说中毫不掩饰地一再说明美国统治集团要继续执行敌视中国人民的政策。杜勒斯假装忘记了美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中，被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军赶回三八线的事实，假装不知道世界舆论对美国无理破坏双方会谈的指责。他打肿脸充胖子，说什么中国“到日内瓦来不是来受我们的礼遇的，而是来到世界舆论的法庭面前申辩的”。为了把日内瓦会议变为制造紧张的场所，杜勒斯企图在这次会议上扮成“原告”，以便于美国堵塞和平协商的道路。杜勒斯这种态度清楚地说明虽然美国在世界人民要求和平协商的压力下不得不同意举行日内瓦会议，但是美国对协商解决争端，却存在着深重的恐惧。
    柏林会议之后，亚洲和欧洲国家不同倾向的舆论普遍欢迎举行日内瓦会议，并且特别指出，中华人民共和国的参加是国际关系上一个新的发展阶段，这就给解决迫切的国际问题、缓和亚洲及世界紧张局势提供了有利的条件。但是，美国反动集团的图谋却是另外一种。他们关心的只是保持和加深国际紧张局势。美国某些议员及报纸在柏林四国外长会议刚结束以后，就开始了一个宣传运动，竭力说日内瓦会议“前途阴暗”，不会有什么成就。例如，“纽约时报”在社论中就明白地要求它的读者不要“对这个会议的结果抱多大的希望”。美国宣传机构散布悲观空气是不怀好意的。
    但是，杜勒斯的阴谋过去没有成功，今后也不会是如意的。杜勒斯在广播演说中把日内瓦会议能否解决朝鲜和印度支那问题，说成是取决于中国“愿意”与否，但是杜勒斯却不能使世界爱好和平人民相信，侵略朝鲜和印度支那的不是美国而是中国。在朝鲜发动侵略战争的是谁呢？在朝鲜停战协定签字后又不断使朝鲜问题解决复杂化，一直制造僵局阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开的又是谁呢？在印度支那驱使法国继续进行侵略战争，并积极加以干涉，公开反对和平解决印度支那问题的是谁呢？在亚洲制造和保持紧张局势，到处设立军事基地，引起广大人民的愤怒和反对的又是谁呢？如果美国在日内瓦会议上不肯尊重亚洲人民的和平意志来解决问题，它将无法逃避在世界舆论面前受审判的命运。这正是想把中国当作“被告”的杜勒斯应当注意的。
    中国坚持和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题是一贯的政策。中国的和平政策、中国参加解决国际重大问题的重要作用，越来越受到亚洲和世界人民的赞成和拥护。杜勒斯想用老办法来诬蔑中国，堵塞和平道路，是不会有结果的。
