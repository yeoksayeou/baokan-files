Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 8th (TASS dispatch): A Washington dispatch in the weekly "Tribune of Nations" writes: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Robertson, expressed "certain opinions regarding the U.S. policy on the Korean issue" to a few reporters. He said that, according to U.S. politicians, the Korean issue is key to the entire U.S. policy in the Far East. Therefore, the U.S. diplomatic approach is to keep the Korean issue on the agenda for a long time. Robertson then said that the Korean War had helped the U.S. implement many measures in the Far East, such as the blockade of the People's Republic of China (although this was against the interests of U.S. allies), pulling Australia and New Zealand into the Pacific alliance (despite Britain's opposition), and concluding the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" that allowed the U.S. to station troops and establish bases on the Japanese islands. Moreover, the Korean War diverted the attention of Southeast Asian countries, making it easier for Japan to rearm.

Therefore, Robertson believes that establishing a lasting peace in Korea would have "fatal consequences" for the U.S. The newspaper writes that if peace were established in Korea, the U.S. would no longer have a formal reason to oppose recognizing People's China and admitting it to the United Nations. The newspaper continues that guaranteeing lasting peace would create problems for the establishment of the Pacific alliance and prevent any further development of it. To avoid this, from the perspective of U.S. politicians, the "most far-sighted" solution is to maintain international tensions. The newspaper points out that the State Department believes that this goal can only be achieved by maintaining the status quo in Korea and continuing the war in Indochina.

    罗伯逊承认美国不愿和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎八日讯：“民族论坛”周刊的一篇华盛顿通讯中写道：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊对少数几个记者发表了“关于美国对朝鲜问题政策的某些意见”。他说，据美国政治家认为，朝鲜问题是美国对远东整个政策的关键。因此，美国外交上的做法就是要使朝鲜问题长期留在日程上。罗伯逊接着说，朝鲜战争曾帮助美国在远东实行了许多措施，如对中华人民共和国进行封锁（虽然这是违反美国盟国的利益的），把澳大利亚和新西兰拉入太平洋联盟（尽管遭到英国的反对），缔结了使美国能在日本岛上驻扎军队和建立基地的美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”。而且，朝鲜战争转移了东南亚国家的注意力，使日本便于进行重新武装。
    因此，罗伯逊认为，在朝鲜建立持久和平会给美国带来“致命的后果”。该报写道，如果在朝鲜建立了和平，美国就再也没有正式理由来反对承认人民中国和接纳人民中国参加联合国了。该报接着说，保障持久和平将使成立太平洋联盟发生问题，并使它不能再得到任何进一步的发展。为了避免这种情况，从美国政治家的观点来看，“最深谋远虑”的解决办法是保持国际紧张局势。该报指出，国务院认为，只有保持朝鲜的现状，继续进行印度支那战争，才能达到这一目的。
