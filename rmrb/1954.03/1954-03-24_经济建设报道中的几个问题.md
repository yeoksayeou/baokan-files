Economic Construction Reporting: Several Problems
Pang Jiyun

Editor's Note: Starting today, this newspaper will successively publish several articles on how newspapers should conduct economic propaganda, for the reference of newspaper workers and propaganda workers in various places.

The newspaper is the most powerful weapon for mobilizing and organizing the people to participate in the cause of national economic construction. As our country enters a period of planned economic construction, newspapers of Party committees at all levels bear a very important responsibility.

The new period of economic construction also presents new tasks for newspapers. That is, newspapers should put economic propaganda in a primary position. When our Party and state use their main strength to solve the problems of economic construction, our newspapers should also devote their main space to reporting on economic construction.

The tasks that Lenin put forward to "Pravda" and "Izvestia" in 1920 are very suitable for our situation today. He said:

"Now, due to the military victory of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the general international situation it is in, production propaganda should be brought back to the first place, strengthened and consolidated organizationally." [Note 1]

The task of newspapers in carrying out economic propaganda is mainly to publicize the achievements of our country's construction, to publicize various policies in economic construction, especially to publicize the general line of the transition period, to mobilize the people to throw themselves into the upsurge of economic construction, to strive to realize the basic tasks of the general line of the transition period and the first five-year plan, and to strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

In the past year or two, newspapers in various places have made many successful reports on economic construction and have accumulated some experience in economic propaganda. However, the issue of economic propaganda is, after all, a new issue encountered by newspapers. The economic propaganda of some newspapers is not done well enough, many reports are too professional and technical, and many readers find the second page of the newspaper—the economic news page—too dry and incomprehensible.

This is indeed a problem. Is the actual economic construction life also so dry and so difficult to understand? Absolutely not! In fact, every construction project has a great charm that attracts people. There are many vivid and fascinating things in economic construction that have not been vividly reflected in our newspapers.

Thus, our newspapers face an urgent question: How should newspapers conduct economic propaganda?

Based on the experience of several newspapers in Northeast China in carrying out economic propaganda, here are a few questions for reference in conducting economic propaganda.

	I. Reflecting All Aspects of National
            Economic Construction
    
The most basic task of newspapers in carrying out economic propaganda is to quickly and comprehensively reflect the situation of national economic construction, to display the entire picture of national economic construction to the people, to make the people see the scale of our country's economic construction, to see the achievements on the economic construction front, and to feel excited and encouraged, so as to actively devote themselves to the upsurge of economic construction.

The main content of our newspapers should be composed of news that reflects all aspects of national construction. Making the factual reports of economic construction occupy the main space of our newspapers is the style that our working-class newspapers should have after winning the revolutionary victory. This is the fundamental difference between our newspapers and bourgeois newspapers.

Lenin said: "Talk less about politics. Politics has been completely 'clarified'... Talk more about economics. But economics does not mean 'general' discussions, scholars' commentaries, intellectuals' plans, and other such nonsense—unfortunately, there is often such nonsense. No, the economics we need refers to the collection, careful examination, and study of the facts of the construction of a truly new life." [Note 2]

To reflect the facts of national construction, newspapers should first prominently and centrally report on key projects that are decisive for the country's socialist industrialization. When readers see the news on the newspaper about the completion and transfer to production of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, and see the newspaper report that the seamless steel pipe plant has produced the first seamless steel pipe and the framework of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is erected on the construction site, they will come to an impression: our country is steadily advancing along the track of socialist industrialization.

In addition to key projects, newspapers should also report on all aspects of the corresponding development of our country's economic construction. The aspects reported by the newspapers should not be too narrow. If the newspaper only talks about what the current central task is, and cannot penetrate into all aspects of people's lives, such a newspaper will not only be too monotonous, but will inevitably weaken its encouraging and educational effect on the masses of the people.

The Northeast Daily, in the column "Finding Underground Treasures for the Motherland," reported on examples such as an old man reporting a mine, and a person contributing a mine area map found from old paper piles; in the column titled "On the Transportation Line," several news items were published, such as "Conductor's Enthusiastic Service," "Five-Year Accident-Free Switchman," and "First Night Flight on the Liao River." The Dalian People's Daily, in the column "Correcting Business Attitudes, Serving Customers Warmly," published news such as "Treating Customers Diligently," "Not Afraid of Trouble to Serve Customers," "Delivering Goods to Construction Sites," and "Peddlers in Changhai County." From these news items, readers saw people participating in the great construction of the motherland in various positions and from various aspects.

Don't think that we have no key projects here, so there is nothing to report. The Jilin Daily reported that a village built a small hydropower station, and electric lights suddenly lit up in the houses of farmers in the mountain valleys. A wood processing plant and a grain processing plant were also established around the small hydropower station, which had a major impact on the lives of the surrounding farmers. Other news such as building forest railways and setting up tractor stations, doesn't this also reflect an aspect of national construction?

There are also many things worth reporting in agriculture. In the Heilongjiang Daily in the past few months, we can find the following news: tractors have come to the countryside; Li Shuzhen created a double-handed thinning method, increasing thinning efficiency by one time; the cultivated land of military dependents of Wang Da'niang is well cultivated; the agricultural technology station uses threshers for farmers to thresh wheat, which is both cheap and frees up farmers' horses to plow the land. These small news items constitute a picture of a new atmosphere in the countryside.

However, many newspaper workers do not sufficiently recognize the significance of this kind of small news that can quickly reflect living local events. Some reporters are unwilling to write this kind of news that reflects the dynamics of construction, feeling that it is not very meaningful, and only want to write news or articles that summarize work experience, because in their view, only such news and articles can play a role in guiding work.

These comrades have not heeded the opinions of readers. What do readers think of the news and articles summarizing work that they write? It can be said that most of them do not like to read them. Because these experiences are nothing more than a set of unified thinking, unified action, going deep into the workshop, grasping the key, and mobilizing the masses. The experience of establishing a responsibility system is these few, and the experience of strengthening planning management is roughly these few. Readers said: "There is no need to read this kind of experience summary, it is all the same, you know the end when you see the beginning." The very lively work that people do, we summarize into very abstract principles, how can we use this kind of news to guide the work?

The editorial department of the Dalian People's Daily checked the news they wrote about the glass factory completing the first quarter plan of last year, and listed eleven "experiences" in the short 500-word news. It is difficult to get truly useful experience from this.

It is not to say that newspapers should not publish articles summarizing experience. Truly well-summarized experience is useful to people and will be welcomed by people. The problem is that the eyes of editors and reporters should not always be on how to summarize experience and guide work, but should think more about the special role of newspapers, which is to use facts to publicize. This kind of publicity is an objective factual report, and at the same time, it should be good at selecting facts in this way, that is, to make the facts themselves be able to shout loudly for us and for our national construction cause, so as to promote our construction cause.

We must remember Lenin's words: "Make less political noise. Make less intellectual discussion. Get closer to life. Pay more attention to what new things the workers and peasants are actually building in their daily work. Check more on how much of these new things belong to communism." [Note 3]

The manuscripts published in the newspapers that vividly reflect the situation of national construction will also play a role in promoting work. Let us see how much role the article written by Comrade Luo He, Director of the Jiaohe Mining Bureau, which was published in the Jilin Daily on National Day last year, played. The title of this article is "The Past and Present of the Jiaohe Coal Mine and Its Beautiful Prospects." It only compared the slave labor in the pseudo-Manchukuo period, the destruction of the mines by the Kuomintang bandits, and our restoration and construction, and told the facts of many workers actively producing after liberation. It put forward the tasks of the coal mine in the first five-year plan and the future development prospects. It did not summarize any experience, nor did it put on a posture of guiding work. However, the workers had a great reaction after reading it. Some workers who were not at ease working in the coal mine were encouraged by this manuscript, developed feelings for the coal mine, and were willing to stay and work. After Director Luo He wrote this manuscript, his leadership prestige also increased. Some workers said: "In the past, our impression was that the director rarely approached us and was somewhat bureaucratic. After reading the article he wrote, we realized that he knew a lot about us workers and was not bureaucratic!"

This example shows that this kind of article that summarizes actual life and makes comparisons is, in fact, a living summary, a living experience, and it can educate the masses more widely and powerfully. Therefore, it in fact plays a role in promoting production and guiding work.

	II. Publicizing the Party's Policies in
         Economic Construction

Economic propaganda in newspapers is not only about reporting some specific events, but also about explaining a policy point of view in these specific events that it reports.

This is where the ideological nature of our Party newspaper lies. We do not purely objectively and uncritically report facts, but select facts according to the requirements of a certain policy point of view, so that the narration of this fact itself becomes the most powerful publicity for a certain policy of the Party.

The task of the Party newspaper is to publicize the Party's policies, to make the masses understand its significance, and to mobilize the broad masses to struggle to realize the Party's policies.

The Party newspaper has its unique and most powerful method of publicizing the Party's policies. The Party newspaper can and must use the form of editorials and other essays to systematically elaborate the Party's policies. This is very important. But this is not a form that can be used in large quantities, and editorials and essays usually only occupy a small space in the newspaper. The newspaper mainly publicizes the Party's policies through the reporting of specific events. That is, it seems that these reports are only narrating a fact, but it guides the reader's thinking in the direction it specifies, and it is using facts to explain a policy point of view.

For example, the Heilongjiang Daily once reported a fact that a mutual aid team welcomed a farmer who had withdrawn from the team back to the team. It only narrated that a member who was originally a member of the mutual aid team withdrew from the team and worked alone, and could not hoe the land, and the mutual aid team also helped him hoe the land. Under the education of the facts, he returned to the mutual aid team. From this fact reported by the Heilongjiang Daily, readers can see the voluntary principle of the Party in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and that it is necessary to be good at waiting for farmers who are not yet highly conscious, and must use facts to tell them that it is better to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation than to work alone.

The Dalian People's Daily's report on November 1st last year on the Dalian Motor Factory's pursuit of output value and failure to produce according to national needs was also a report with a strong policy and ideological nature. It pointed out that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the factory produced a large number of products that were easy to make but were not urgently needed by the state, and did not produce according to the needs of the varieties and ordering units stipulated by the state. In this way, although the apparent figures for increasing production and practicing economy increased, in fact, on the one hand, a large number of products were stockpiled, wasting state funds, and on the other hand, it could not supply the needs of the state and various ordering units in time, affecting the production of other links in the country. This lack of a comprehensive view of completing the national plan clearly violates the Party's policy of increasing production and practicing economy.

In the transition period, the Party's general line is to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. This is the lighthouse that illuminates all work. Our newspapers must report on all events in accordance with the spirit of the general line of the transition period.

Therefore, it is not enough to only report one specific event after another in our newspapers. It is also necessary to explain the significance of these specific events from the perspective of their importance to the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Let readers see from the reports of these specific events the trend of our country gradually transitioning to a socialist society.

Some comrades feel that the reports of some of our newspapers have no line, and it is impossible to see from its reports what our country is doing and where it is going. This is because these specific events are not reported in connection with the entire cause of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and the spirit of the general line of the transition period is not embodied in the reports of these specific events.

For example, many newspapers have reported on workers discussing plans, implementing the responsibility system, strengthening planning management, increasing production and practicing economy, and so on. The impression these reports give to readers is just one movement after another. These movements are not connected in the readers' minds, and they cannot see a general trend of national progress from these movements. Readers do not understand: why the newspaper always reports on the responsibility system movement during this period, and what is worth talking about every day about transferring cadres to basic construction.

The newspaper can completely report on these movements from the perspective of accelerating national industrialization. If the newspaper reports on the implementation of the responsibility system and the strengthening of planning management from the perspective of improving the management level of socialist enterprises, pointing out that in order to accelerate the country's industrialization, we must make our enterprise management level keep up with the requirements of industrial development, then readers will feel that the movement to implement the responsibility system is a very meaningful issue.

Similarly, when reporting on the movement to increase production and practice economy, it should also be pointed out that this is a matter of accumulating funds for the realization of socialist industrialization.

If newspapers report on each movement from the significance of accelerating national industrialization, then readers will also feel that these movements are closely related, and they are the various stations that the country has passed through on the road to socialist industrialization.

	III. Publicizing Advanced Figures in
          Economic Construction

Economic propaganda in newspapers is mainly not about publicizing production technology in a trivial way, but about publicizing the activities of people who master technology. An important task of newspapers is to publicize advanced figures in the implementation of the country's general line. Advanced people in production are completely new people, and there is no more powerful way to educate the masses than with this living example. Newspapers should publicize their achievements and call on everyone to imitate them.

Lenin once pointed out: "We use very few vivid and concrete examples and models from all aspects of life to educate the masses—and this is the main task of newspapers during the transition period from capitalism to communism." [Note 4]

An event that happens in a workshop, as long as it is mentioned on the national forum of the newspaper, becomes a major event known to everyone in the country and has a major impact on other places. Many local newspapers in Northeast China reported on the deeds of Zhang Mingshan, who created the anti-encircling disc in the Anshan Small Rolling Mill, which led to a movement of mechanization and automation throughout Anshan Iron and Steel and many places in Northeast China.

Many workers in various places have reflected that they like to read reports on the deeds of advanced figures in the newspaper. Publicizing the achievements of advanced figures in the newspaper has a great encouraging effect on the masses. Once a model deed of a worker is spread, it will mobilize the broad masses.

The Northeast Daily's report on Wang Chonglun, an advanced young planer of the Machinery General Factory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, was very successful.

The Northeast Daily reported on the front page in a prominent position that Wang Chonglun treated his work with a socialist labor attitude and a reformer's posture, transformed tools, greatly broke the quota, and completed the production task ahead of schedule.

Subsequently, we saw many such news in the Northeast Daily: workers in Shenyang and Harbin and other places held symposiums one after another after reading the Northeast Daily to discuss and learn from Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit.

Wang Wenshan and other eleven labor models in Shenyang wrote a letter calling on the workers in Shenyang to learn from Wang Chonglun. In their letter, they pointed out: if all the workers in the city and the country were like Wang Chonglun, completing the task ahead of schedule, the day of national industrialization would come ahead of schedule.

Not only ordinary workers, but even the deputy director of the Shenyang Paper Mill also wrote an article in the Northeast Daily. He said: administrative management personnel cannot only be busy with affairs, they must rely on the working class and support the growth of new things. The chairman of the trade union of the Shenyang 401 Construction Site wrote an article saying that Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit put forward tasks for the trade union, which is to promote socialist ideology to the workers. Because Wang Chonglun has a socialist labor attitude, he has a pioneering spirit. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the CPC, the Songjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have all issued instructions calling for a movement to learn from Wang Chonglun.

The influence of young planer Wang Chonglun has far exceeded the scope of the working masses. The masses of people across the country and the volunteer soldiers on the Korean front have all written letters to congratulate him. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has also written him a congratulatory letter.

From the above introduction, it can be seen how much role publicizing advanced figures can play in promoting production and work.

However, some newspapers rarely publicize advanced figures for a long time. The staff of these editorial departments excused themselves by saying that there were no advanced figures there, so there was no way to publicize them. The problem is not that there are no advanced figures, but that the newspaper has not gone to discover them. The emergence of a new person and a new thing is not very eye-catching at first. The newspaper must be good at identifying and discovering, supporting their bold creative behavior, and giving sufficient evaluation to their creative behavior.

On our economic front, there are countless heroes who bravely fight against various disasters and accidents and work selflessly to complete the national plan. Reporters must go deep into life to discover and recognize them, and they must have full enthusiasm to describe their heroic deeds.

A fisherman in the Dalian area issued a warning to the reporter: can you sit on our boat and go to sea with us to see how we fight the wind and waves and report us in the newspaper!

The workers asked the reporter to show the same enthusiasm as when writing about the heroes on the Korean front to write about their advanced figures. Our newspapers should not disappoint the workers. Let our newspapers also have that kind of moving news that describes the heroic deeds of advanced producers!

Some newspapers also constantly put forward the names of many models. But none of them were remembered by people. The influence of these advanced producers introduced in the newspapers did not even cross the scope of a factory.

The main task of newspapers in publicizing advanced figures is to publicize their advanced ideas and new labor attitudes. Of course, when introducing their model deeds, they will definitely talk about their inventions and creations, and their technical reforms, but the newspaper is precisely using these facts to explain their ideas and activities.

Yang Enfa, an inspector of the Shenyang Vehicle Section, published an article in the Northeast Daily, saying that he was greatly moved when he saw the news in the newspaper that Wang Chonglun created a universal tool tire and improved production efficiency. He thought: although Wang Chonglun had never made rock drill parts, when he thought that if he could not make parts, it would affect mining and iron smelting, he was determined to overcome difficulties and research out a "universal tool tire"; and when he repaired trains, sometimes he could not repair them on time because there were no tools, so he thought that the responsibility was not his. Why can't we be like Wang Chonglun, thinking that if the train breaks down and cannot participate in transportation, it will be a great loss to the country, and actively think of ways to create tools to repair the train on time? It is not that the manufacturing method of the universal tool tire directly helps him in any way, but that Wang Chonglun's master's socialist labor attitude and bold innovative spirit have inspired him.

Generally speaking, the main task of Party newspapers in promoting advanced technology is to call on people to master technology, point out the significance of mastering technology for the development of industry, and fight against various ideas that hinder the mastery of production technology.

Of course, at present, when our technical journals and technical books are still few and cannot be popularized, it is still very necessary to popularly explain the most universally significant and important advanced technologies and advanced labor organization methods in the newspapers. It is impossible to promote advanced experience without advanced technology. And workers' newspapers and farmers' newspapers bear a particularly important responsibility in promoting the most universally significant new technologies.

	IV. Publicizing the Relationship between Economic
          Construction and People's Lives

The purpose of our economic construction is to gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of continuous development of production. This clear purpose of our construction for the people should be reflected in the reports of newspapers.

Why do readers not like to read some economic propaganda in newspapers? An important reason is that we rarely talk about things related to the lives of the broad masses of people, but only talk about problems that only a few business personnel need to know.

In fact, every construction project and every department's production is directly or fundamentally related to the lives of the people, and the people are very concerned about the production and construction that is closely related to their lives.

The Dalian People's Daily reader's letter group received a letter from a farmer reader, who put forward opinions on the specifications of the shirts produced by the Dalian Knitting Factory, saying that farmers are not used to wearing pullover shirts and like button-down shirts, and sent two drawings. It can be seen that the people care about production. If the newspaper can report what relationship a certain product has with the lives of the people, readers will definitely like to read such news or news reports.

The Dalian People's Daily's "Everyone Loves 'White Bear' Brand Sweaters" published on November 4th last year is exactly a news report that has done this well. In this news report, we see that producers, promoters, and consumers are completely connected together. The news report reports how good-looking and lovable the "White Bear" brand sweaters produced by the Dalian Knitting Factory, which are displayed in the showcases of department stores, are, and they are snapped up by buyers as soon as they are put on the market. However, the good reputation of the "White Bear" brand sweaters did not come easily, it also went through a period of struggle to overcome difficulties. In 1952, the "White Bear" brand sweaters were still substandard goods, and no one paid attention to them when they were placed in the showcases, and buyers went to buy the "Flying Horse" brand and "Wuhe" brand sweaters produced by private factories. Later, the deputy director of the factory went to the department store to solicit the opinions of the salespersons, and the salespersons reflected the needs of the people to him: women do not like round-neck pullover sweaters, because pulling them over their heads will mess up their hair, and the oil on their hair will easily stain the sweaters, and they require sweaters with shoulder straps, zippers, or concealed buttons. "White Bear" brand sweaters only have two sizes, while those from other places have four sizes. The style of "White Bear" brand sweaters is also not particular, the top and bottom are generally thick, like a wooden barrel. The female salesperson also took out the sweaters from other places for the deputy director to see: the top is wide at the chest, the middle is thin at the waist, and the bottom is wide at the hem. After such research and improvement, the production of the Dalian Knitting Factory was connected to the market and the needs of the people. The factory also constantly holds knitting exhibitions, inviting salespersons, patrons, and workers to visit and give opinions. Now the factory can produce nine styles of sweaters that are welcomed by the masses: there are beautiful sweaters with shoulder straps, zippers, and concealed buttons with slim waists that young girls love; there are sweaters specially designed for mothers to breastfeed their babies.

Originally, there are many vivid things related to the broad masses of people, but our reporters have written them into technical specialized articles that the masses cannot understand. For example, when reporting on the completion of workers' dormitories, if we say how big a piece of houses were built, how many households of workers have moved into the new houses, and how comfortable and convenient the workers feel in the rooms, wouldn't such news be popular? However, some reporters only go to write about how to carry out construction management and how to carry out the scheduling of building materials. If we only report such news, the broad masses of course will not be interested in reading it.

From what we have said above, we cannot conclude that only the production of means of subsistence can explain its relationship with the lives of the people. It seems that the production of means of production cannot explain what relationship it has with the lives of the people. The newspaper should explain to the people that the most fundamental way to improve the people's lives is to develop heavy industry. Not only will the steel rails rolled by large rolling mills facilitate people's transportation, but the iron smelted by the newly built No. 7 blast furnace and the seamless steel pipes made by the seamless steel pipe plant will have a great impact on people's lives. The newspaper should explain to the people: without the development of heavy industry, agriculture and light industry cannot be developed.

It is right for the newspaper to use the main space to report on the workers' production activities. However, the workers in our country are not only able to make steel and mine coal, they are also cultured and engaged in socio-political activities. The newspaper should reflect the rich and multifaceted lives of our people.

Why do readers like to read a news report from the Northeast Daily, "Models Are Learning in a Model Way"? Because it tells readers about the situation of Tian Guiying, Su Changyou, Liu Jinggui, and other figures that are very familiar to them and that they care about now studying at school.

Readers are also willing to read another news report from the Northeast Daily, "A Constituency in Steel Capital." Because readers are already very familiar with the production of steel in Anshan, and now the newspaper tells them what the people of Anshan are like on the day of the general election, readers see that the elected people's representatives are all people they are familiar with: Meng Tai, the old hero, and Zhang Mingshan, the creator of the anti-encircling disc.

However, some of our newspapers are too monotonous, and there is no atmosphere of life on the page. The workers' demands are reasonable. They say that the newspaper only reports on the eight hours of production in his twenty-four-hour day, and the newspaper still owes him eight hours or sixteen hours. The worker said: "I produce every day, and when I look at the newspaper, it only talks about production, so I don't like to read it." Workers sometimes go to the "Worker's Life" column in the newspaper to look for a reproduction of their lives. However, the "Worker's Life" column only talks about how to find tricks, engage in competitions, etc., and it still does not go out of the factory or workshop. Therefore, workers call this "Worker's Life" column the "Worker's Production" column.

The above-mentioned problems are of course not all the problems in improving economic construction reporting. At the same time, these problems in this article have not yet been fully resolved. To fully solve the problems, it is still necessary for newspapers in various places to continuously summarize and improve the existing experience in rich practice.

### 经济建设报道中的几个问题

    经济建设报道中的几个问题
    庞季云
    编者按：本报从今天起，陆续发表几篇关于报纸怎样进行经济宣传的文章，供各地报纸工作者和宣传工作者参考。
    报纸是动员人民和组织人民参加国家经济建设事业的最有力的武器。在我们国家进入有计划的经济建设的时期，各级党委的报纸更负有非常重要的责任。
    经济建设的新时期，也向报纸提出了新任务。这就是报纸应该把经济宣传提到首要地位。在我们党和国家用主要力量来解决经济建设的问题时，我们的报纸也应当拿出它的主要篇幅来报道经济建设。
    列宁在一九二○年向“真理报”和“消息报”所提出的任务，非常适合我们今天的情况。他说：
  “现在，由于俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国在军事上的胜利以及它所处的总的国际形势，生产宣传应当重新提到第一位，应当加强并在组织上巩固起来。”〔注一〕
    报纸进行经济宣传的任务，主要就是宣传我们国家建设的成就，宣传经济建设中的各种政策，特别是宣传过渡时期的总路线，以动员人民投入经济建设的热潮，为实现过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务而奋斗，为实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
    近一两年来，各地报纸作了不少关于经济建设的成功的报道，积累了一些经济宣传的经验。但是经济宣传问题毕竟是报纸所遇到的新问题。有些报纸的经济宣传就作得不够好，许多报道的业务性和技术性太强，不少读者对于报纸的第二版——经济新闻版，感觉太枯燥，看不懂。
    这确是一个问题。难道实际的经济建设生活也是这样枯燥、这样不好理解吗？绝不是的！实际上哪个建设工程都具有吸引人们的很大的魅力。经济建设中有很多生动的引人入胜的事情，而没有被我们的报纸生动地反映出来。
    于是，我们的报纸就面对着一个迫切的问题：报纸应该怎样进行经济宣传？
    这里根据东北若干报纸进行经济宣传的经验，提出几个问题，作为报纸进行经济宣传的参考。
      一、反映国家经济建设的
          各方面情况
    报纸进行经济宣传的最基本的任务，就是迅速地多方面地反映国家经济建设的情况，把国家经济建设的整幅画面显示给人民，使人民看到我们国家经济建设的规模，看到经济建设战线上的各项成就，感到兴奋和鼓舞，从而积极地投身于经济建设的热潮。
    我们的报纸的主要内容应该是由这种反映国家建设各方面情况的新闻构成的。使经济建设的事实报道占据我们报纸的主要篇幅，这就是在取得革命胜利之后我们工人阶级的报纸所应有的风格。这是我们的报纸与资产阶级的报纸根本不同的地方。　　列宁说：“少谈点政治。政治已经完全‘明朗化’……多谈一点经济。但经济并不是指‘一般的’议论、学者的评述、知识分子的计划诸如此类的废话而言，——可惜，常常有的就是这类废话。不，我们所需要的经济是指收集、仔细检查和研究真正新生活建设的事实。”〔注二〕
    要反映国家建设的事实，报纸首先应该突出地集中地报道对国家的社会主义工业化有决定意义的重点工程。读者看到了报纸上关于鞍钢三大工程竣工和移交生产的消息，看到了报纸报道无缝钢管厂制出了第一根无缝钢管和第一汽车制造厂的厂房架子在工地上竖立起来，他就会得出一个印象：我们国家正在沿着社会主义工业化的轨道稳步地前进着。
    除了重点工程外，报纸还应该报道我们国家经济建设的其他相应发展的各方面情况。报纸报道的方面不应该很狭窄。如果报纸只讲目前的中心任务是什么，而不能深入人民生活的各方面，这样的报纸就不仅是太单调了，并且必然会削弱它对人民群众的鼓舞作用和教育作用。
    东北日报在“为祖国寻找地下宝藏”的辟栏中，报道了老人报矿、一个人献出从旧纸堆里找出的矿区图等事例；以“在运输线上”为题的辟栏中，发表了“列车员热心服务”，“五年无事故的扳道员”和“首次夜航辽河”等几条新闻。旅大人民日报在“端正营业态度，热诚为顾客服务”的辟栏中，刊登了“殷勤地招待顾客”，“为顾客服务不能怕麻烦”，“把货送到工地上”，“长海县的货郎担”等消息。读者从这些消息中看到了人们在各个岗位上、从各个方面参加着祖国伟大的建设事业。
    不要认为我们这里没有什么重点工程，就没有什么可报道的。吉林日报报道了一个村子建设了一个小型水电站，在山沟农民的房子里突然亮起了电灯，环绕着小型水电站又建立了木材加工厂和粮食加工厂，因而对周围农民的生活发生了重大的影响。其他如修筑森林铁路和设立拖拉机站等消息，这不是也反映了国家建设的一个方面吗？
    农业方面也有很多值得报道的事情。我们在前几个月的黑龙江日报上，可以找到下列一些消息：拖拉机来到了农村；李淑珍创造双手间苗法，提高间苗效率一倍；军属王大娘的代耕地耕种得很好；农业技术站给农民用脱谷机打麦，费用又便宜，又能腾出农民的马来翻地。这些小消息就构成了一幅农村新气象的图画。
    可是许多报纸工作人员对于这种能够迅速地反映活生生的地方事件的小消息的意义是认识不足的。有些记者不愿意写这种反映建设动态的新闻，觉得没有多大意思，只想写总结工作经验的新闻或文章，因为在他们看来，只有这样的新闻和文章才能够起指导工作的作用。
    这些同志没有理会读者的意见。读者对于他们所写的这种总结工作的新闻和文章是怎样看法的呢？可以说是对于其中的大多数是不喜欢看的。因为这些经验不外是统一思想、统一行动、深入车间、抓住关键、发动群众等一套。建立责任制的经验是这几条，加强计划管理的经验大体上也是这几条。读者说：“这种经验总结不用看了，千篇一律，看了头就知道了尾。”人家做的非常生动的工作，叫我们给总结成非常抽象的几条原则，怎能拿这种新闻去指导工作呢？
    旅大人民日报编辑部检查他们所写的关于玻璃工厂完成去年第一季度计划的消息，在短短五百字的新闻中罗列了十一条“经验”。要使人们从这里面获得真正有益的经验，那是困难的。
    不是说报纸就不应该登载总结经验的文章了。真正总结得好的经验对人们是有用的，会被人们欢迎的。问题在于，编辑和记者的眼睛不要老望着如何总结经验和指导工作，而应该多多想到报纸的特殊作用就是要用事实来宣传。这种宣传是一种客观的事实报道，同时要善于这样来选择事实，就是要使得事实本身能够为我们、为我们的国家建设事业而大声疾呼，从而推进我们的建设事业。
    我们要记住列宁的话：“少发点政治噪声。少发些知识分子的议论。更加接近些生活。多注意点工农群众事实上在他们的日常工作中建设着什么新事物。多检查一下这些新事物有多少属于共产主义的。”〔注三〕
    报纸上发表的写得生动的反映国家建设情况的稿件，也会起推动工作的作用。让我们看看去年国庆节吉林日报上登载的蛟河矿务局局长骆鹤同志所写的一篇文章起了多大的作用吧。这篇文章的题目叫做“蛟河煤矿的今昔及其美好的远景”，它只是把伪满时的奴役劳动、国民党匪帮对矿山的破坏和我们的恢复建设作了一个比较，讲了解放以后许多工人积极生产的事实，提出了煤矿在第一个五年计划中的任务和将来的发展远景。它并没有总结什么经验，也没有摆出要指导工作的架势。可是工人看了，却发生了很大的反响。有些不安心在煤矿工作的工人，受了这篇稿子的鼓舞，对煤矿发生了感情，愿留下工作了。局长骆鹤同志写过这篇稿子以后，他的领导威信也提高了。有的工人说：“过去我们的印象，局长很少接近我们，有些官僚主义。看到他写的文章，才知道他晓得我们工人很多事，并不官僚主义呀！”
    这个例子说明，这种概括了实际生活，并作了对比的文章，事实上是一种活的总结、活的经验，它能更广泛更有力地教育群众。因而它在事实上起了推动生产指导工作的作用。
    二、宣传党在经济建设中的
          政策
    报纸上的经济宣传不仅是要报道一些具体事件，而且还要在它所报道的这些具体事件中说明一种政策的观点。
    我们党报的思想性就在这里。我们并不是纯客观地无批判地报道事实，而是按照一定政策观点的要求对事实加以选择，使这种事实的叙述本身就成为对党的某项政策的最有力的宣传。
    党报的任务就是宣传党的政策，使群众了解它的意义，动员广大群众为实现党的政策而奋斗。
    党报有它特有的和最有力的宣传党的政策的方法。党报可以而且必须用社论和其他论文的形式来有系统地阐明党的政策。这是非常重要的。但这还不是能大量采用的形式，社论和论文通常只占了报纸的不大的篇幅。报纸主要地是通过对于具体事件的报道来宣传党的政策。这就是看来这些报道只在叙述一件事实，可是它却将读者的思想引导到它所指定的方向上去，它是在用事实说明一种政策观点。
    例如在黑龙江日报上曾报道了一个互助组欢迎退组的农民回组的一件事实。它只叙述了一个原是互助组的组员退了组单干后，地锄不过来了，互助组还帮助他锄了地，在事实的教育下他又回到互助组。从黑龙江日报报道的这一个事实中，读者就能看出党在互助合作运动中的自愿原则，对于觉悟还不高的农民必须善于等待，必须用事实告诉他们走互助合作的道路比单干好。
    去年十一月一日旅大人民日报关于大连电机厂单纯追求产值不按国家需要进行生产的报道，也是政策性和思想性比较强的一篇报道。它指出了该厂在增产节约运动中大量地生产容易制作但是国家并不急需的产品，而不按照国家规定的品种和订货单位的需要进行生产。这样，虽然表面的增产节约数字增加了，但是实际上一方面积压了大批产品，浪费了国家资金，另一方面又不能按时供应国家和各订货单位的需要，影响了国家其他环节的生产。这种缺乏全面地完成国家计划的观点，显然是违背了党的增产节约的政策的。
    在过渡时期，党的总路线是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步实现对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这是照耀一切工作的灯塔。我们的报纸，必须按照过渡时期总路线的精神去报道一切事件。
    因此，在我们的报纸上只是报道了一个一个的具体事件还是不够的，还必须从这些具体事件对国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的重要性上来说明它们的意义。让读者从这些具体事件的报道中，就能看出我们国家向着社会主义社会逐步过渡的趋势。
    一些同志感到我们有些报纸的报道没有路线，从它的报道中看不出我们国家在干什么，在向那里前进，这就是因为没有把这些具体事件与国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的整个事业联系起来报道，没有在这些具体事件的报道中体现过渡时期总路线的精神。
    例如许多报纸都报道了工人讨论计划、贯彻责任制、加强计划管理、增产节约等等运动。这些报道给读者的印象只是一个运动接着一个运动，这些运动在读者的头脑中联系不起来，他们不能从这些运动中看出国家前进的一个总的趋势。读者不明白：为什么这一个时期报纸老是报道责任制运动，向基本建设方面调干部有什么值得天天去讲的。
    报纸完全可以将这些运动提到为了加速国家工业化的意义上去报道。如果报纸从提高社会主义企业的管理水平的角度来报道贯彻责任制和加强计划管理的问题，指出为了加速国家的工业化，就必须使我们的企业管理水平赶上工业发展的要求，那么，读者就会感觉到贯彻责任制运动是非常有意义的问题了。
    同样，在报道增产节约运动时，也应该指出这是为了实现社会主义工业化而积累资金的问题。
    如果报纸都从加速国家工业化这个意义去报道各个运动，那么读者也就会感到这些运动都是有密切联系的了，它们是国家在社会主义工业化的路途中所经过的各个站口。
    三、宣传经济建设中的先进
          人物
    报纸上的经济宣传主要地并不是要琐碎地宣传生产技术，而是要宣传掌握技术的人的活动。报纸的一个重要任务就是宣传在执行国家的总路线中的先进人物。生产中的先进者，这完全是一种新人，再没有比用这种活生生的榜样去教育群众更加有力的了。报纸应该宣扬他们的成绩，叫大家来仿效。
    列宁曾指出：“我们很少用生活各方面的生动具体的例子和榜样来教育群众，——而这是从资本主义向共产主义过渡的时期内报纸的主要任务。”〔注四〕
    在一个车间发生的事件，只要一提到报纸这个全民的讲坛上来，就变为全国任人皆知、对别处发生重大影响的大事情。东北许多地方报纸报道了鞍山小型轧钢厂张明山创造反围盘的事迹，就带动整个鞍钢和东北许多地方开展了一个机械化自动化的运动。
    许多地方的工人都反映爱看报纸上对先进人物事迹的报道。在报纸上宣传先进人物的成就，对群众的鼓舞作用是很大的。一个工人的模范事迹一经传开，就会把广大群众动员起来。
    东北日报关于鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂先进的青年刨工王崇伦的报道是很成功的。
    东北日报在第一版显著地位报道了王崇伦用社会主义的劳动态度和革新者的姿态对待工作，改造工具，大大突破定额，提前完成生产任务。
    接着，我们在东北日报上又陆续看到这样许多消息：沈阳和哈尔滨等地工人看到东北日报后，纷纷开座谈会，讨论学习王崇伦的首创精神。
    沈阳市王文山等十一位劳动模范写信号召沈阳市职工都来学习王崇伦。他们在信里指出：如果全市和全国工人都像王崇伦一样，提前完成任务，就会使国家工业化的日子提前到来。
    不仅是普通工人，连沈阳造纸厂副厂长也在东北日报上写了文章，他说：行政管理人员不能只忙于事务，必须依靠工人阶级，支持新鲜事物的生长。沈阳四○一工地工会主席写文章说：王崇伦的首创精神给工会提出了任务，就是要向工人宣传社会主义思想。因为王崇伦具有社会主义的劳动态度，所以他才有首创的精神。中共吉林省委、松江省工会联合会和哈尔滨市工会联合会等都发出指示号召开展学习王崇伦的运动。
    青年刨工王崇伦的影响还远远超过了工人群众的范围，全国各地的人民群众，朝鲜前线的志愿军战士都写信来为他祝贺，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会也给他写了祝贺信。
    从上面的介绍可以看出，宣传先进人物对于生产和工作会起多大的推动作用。
    可是有些报纸在很长的时期很少宣传先进人物。这些编辑部的工作人员借口说，他们那里没有先进人物，因此无从宣传起。问题不在于没有先进人物，而在于报纸没有去发现他们。一种新人新事的出现，最初并不是很惹人注目的，报纸要善于识别和发现，支持他们的大胆创造行为，并对他们的创造行为给以足够的评价。
    在我们的经济战线上有着无数和各种灾害、事故作英勇斗争，为完成国家计划而奋不顾身地劳动的英雄。记者必须深入生活才能发现和认识他们，必须有满腔热情才能把他们的英雄事迹描写出来。
    旅大地区一个渔民向记者发出了警号：你们可不可以坐着我们的船跟我们到海上去，看看我们怎样和风浪作斗争，给我们登登报呢！
    工人要求记者拿出像写朝鲜前线英雄的那种热情来写他们的先进人物。我们的报纸不应该辜负工人。让我们的报纸上也有那种描写先进生产者的英雄事迹的动人的通讯吧！
    有些报纸也不断地提出了许多模范的名字。可是都没有被人们记住。报纸上所介绍的这些先进生产者的影响，甚至逾越不出一个工厂的范围。
    报纸宣传先进人物，主要是宣传他们的先进思想和新的劳动态度。当然在介绍他们的模范事迹时，一定会讲到他们的发明创造，他们在技术上的改革，但是报纸正是透过这些事实去说明他们的思想和活动。
    沈阳车辆段检车员杨恩发在东北日报上发表文章说，他从报纸上看到王崇伦创造万能工具胎、提高生产效率的消息受到很大的感动。他想：王崇伦虽然没有作过凿岩机零件，但想到作不出零件就影响采矿炼铁时，就决心克服困难，研究出“万能工具胎”来；而自己修理火车，有时因为没有工具不能按时修好，就认为责任不在自己。为什么不能像王崇伦那样，想到火车坏了不能参加运输，对国家是很大的损失，而积极想办法创造工具把车按时修好呢？在这里并不是万能工具胎的制作方法直接对他有什么帮助，而是王崇伦的主人翁的社会主义劳动态度和大胆革新精神对他有启发。
    一般地说，党报对于推广先进技术的主要任务是：号召人们掌握技术，指出掌握技术对于发展工业的意义，向阻碍掌握生产技术的各种思想做斗争。
    当然，在目前我们的技术刊物和技术书籍还很少和还不能普及的情况下，在报纸上通俗地讲解有普遍意义的和最重要的先进技术和先进的劳动组织方法，还是十分必要的。宣传先进经验也不可能离开先进的技术。而工人报纸和农民报纸在推广有关的最有普遍意义的新技术方面，更担负着特别重大的责任。
      四、宣传经济建设和人民
          生活的关系
    我们进行经济建设的目的就是在生产不断发展的基础上逐步地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。我们建设的这种为人民的鲜明的目的性就应该在报纸的报道中体现出来。
    报纸上有些经济宣传，读者为什么不喜欢看呢？一个重要的原因就是我们很少讲和广大人民生活有关的事情，而只讲只有少数业务人员才需要知道的问题。
    事实上，我们的每一项建设工程，每一部门的生产，都是和人民的生活有直接的或根本的关系，而人民对于和自己的生活有密切关系的生产和建设是十分关心的。
    旅大人民日报读者来信组收到了一位农民读者的来信，他对旅大针织厂出产的衬衣的规格提出了意见，说农民不习惯穿套头的衬衣，喜欢要开扣的，并画了两张图样寄来。可见人民对生产是关心的。如果报纸能够报道某一生产品对人民生活有什么关系，这样的新闻或通讯，读者一定喜欢看的。
    旅大人民日报去年十一月四日发表的“人人喜爱的‘白熊’牌绒衣”，正是作到了这点的一篇通讯。在这篇通讯中我们看到生产者、推销者和消费者完全联结在一起了。通讯中报道陈列在百货公司橱柜中的旅大针织厂出产的“白熊”牌绒衣有多么好看，多么令人喜爱，一上市就被买主抢光了。但是，“白熊”牌绒衣这么好的名誉不是轻易得来的，它也经过了一段克服困难的斗争。一九五二年，
  “白熊”牌绒衣还是次等货，放在橱柜中没人去理它，买主都去购买私营工厂出产的“飞马”牌和
  “五和”牌的绒衣。后来该厂副厂长到百货公司征求营业员的意见，营业员向他反映了人民的需要：女同志不喜欢圆领套头的绒衣，因为套头时把她的头发弄乱了，头发上的油也容易把绒衣沾污，她们要求上肩带拉链或暗扣的绒衣。“白熊”牌绒衣只有两个尺码，外地来的有四个尺码。“白熊”牌绒衣式样也不讲究，上下一般粗，像木桶似的。女营业员还拿出外地来的绒衣给副厂长看：上面胸宽，中间腰细，下襟宽。经过这样的研究改进后，旅大针织厂的生产就和市场、人民的需要联系起来了。该厂还不断地举行针织品展览会，请营业员、顾主、工人参观，提意见。现在该厂已能生产九种式样为群众欢迎的绒衣了：有年轻姑娘喜爱的上肩带拉链和暗扣的细腰的美丽的绒衣；有专为妈妈给孩子哺乳方便的绒衣。
    本来有许多和广大群众有关的生动的事情，却被我们的记者写成了群众看不懂的技术性的专门文章。例如报道职工宿舍竣工，如果我们说盖了多大一片的房子，有多少户职工已搬入新居，工人感觉房间多么舒适方便，这样的新闻不是会有人喜欢看吗？可是有些记者却只去写怎样进行施工管理，怎样进行建筑材料的调度。光报道这样的新闻，广大群众当然不会有兴趣看的。
    从我们上面所说的，不能得出结论说只有关于生活资料的生产才能说明它和人民生活的关系，似乎生产资料的生产就说不出它和人民生活有什么关系。报纸应向人民说明，最根本地改善人民生活的途径还是发展重工业，不仅大型轧钢厂轧出的钢轨会便利人民的交通，就是新修建的七号高炉炼出来的铁，无缝钢管厂制出来的无缝钢管，都会对人民的生活发生极大的影响。报纸应向人民说明：没有重工业的发展，农业和轻工业是不能够发展的。
    报纸应用主要的篇幅报道工人的生产活动是对的。但是我们国家的工人并不是只会炼钢和采煤，他们还是有文化的和进行社会政治活动的人。报纸应该反映我国人民的丰富的多方面的生活。
    读者为什么很喜欢看东北日报的一篇通讯“模范们在模范地学习着”呢？因为它告诉了读者们非常熟悉和关心的人物田桂英、苏长有、刘景贵等现在在学校里学习的情形。
    东北日报另一篇通讯“在钢都的一个选区”，读者也愿意看。因为读者对于鞍山出钢已是很熟悉了，现在报纸又告诉他们鞍山的人们在普选的日子里是怎样的，读者看到当选的人民代表都是他们所熟悉的人：孟泰老英雄和创造反围盘的张明山。
    可是我们有些报纸就未免太单调了，在报面上显不出生活的气息。工人的要求是有理由的，他们说报纸只报道了他每天二十四小时生活中的八小时生产，报纸还欠下他八小时或十六小时的债。工人说：“我天天生产，看看报纸也是只讲生产，就不爱看。”工人有时就到报纸上的“工人生活”栏里去寻找关于他们的生活的再现。但是“工人生活”栏里，还只是讲的如何找窍门，搞竞赛等等，说来说去还没有出了工厂或车间的院墙。所以，工人把这种“工人生活”栏叫作“工人生产”栏。
    上述几个问题，自然还不是改进经济建设报道中的全部问题。同时，在本文中这些问题也不是就已得到全部解决的。要全部解决问题，还有待于各地报纸在丰富的实践中，把已有的经验不断地加以总结和提高。〔注一〕列宁：生产宣传提纲。〔注二〕、〔注三〕、〔注四〕列宁：论我们报纸的性质。
