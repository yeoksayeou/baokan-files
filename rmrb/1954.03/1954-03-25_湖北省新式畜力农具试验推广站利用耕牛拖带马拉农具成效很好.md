The Hubei Provincial New Animal-Powered Farm Implement Experiment and Promotion Station has successfully experimented with using cattle power to pull "horse-drawn farm implements." In the South, horses are scarce and feed is expensive, preventing many farmers from using horse-drawn farm implements. In response to this situation, the Hubei Provincial New Animal-Powered Farm Implement Experiment and Promotion Station experimented with converting horse-drawn implements to be pulled by cattle, with excellent results. Using cattle to pull "horse-drawn farm implements" is only a quarter slower in speed compared to horses, while the plowing technology is the same as that of horses. It still improves production efficiency several times compared to using old-fashioned farm implements. Using two water buffalo to pull an animal-powered crank arm harvester or an animal-powered seeder can harvest or sow 60 mu of wheat (barley and soybeans are also possible) per day, equivalent to the daily workload of dozens of farmers using old-fashioned farm implements. Two water buffalo pulling an animal-powered disc harrow can harrow 45 mu per day, increasing work efficiency six times compared to using an old-fashioned harrow. The animal-powered double-share double-furrow plow, pulled by two water buffalo, can plow an average of 10 mu of land per day, increasing work efficiency four times compared to the old-fashioned plow.

    湖北省新式畜力农具试验推广站利用耕牛拖带马拉农具成效很好
    湖北省新式畜力农具试验推广站，利用牛力拖带“马拉农具”试验成功。南方马少，饲养料贵，许多农民因此无法使用马拉农具。湖北省新式畜力农具试验推广站根据这种情况，试验把马拉改成牛拉，结果成绩很好。用牛拖带“马拉农具”只在速度上比马拉慢四分之一，而在耕作技术上和马拉的一样，比用旧式农具还是提高生产效率好几倍：用两条水牛拉畜力摇臂收割机或畜力播种机，每日可收割或播种小麦（大麦、黄豆都可）六十亩，相当于数十个农民用旧式农具耕作的一日工作量；两条水牛拉畜力圆盘耙每日可耙四十五亩，比用旧式耙工作效率提高六倍；畜力双抢双铧犁，用两条水牛拉，每日平均可耕地十亩，比老式犁工作效率提高四倍。
