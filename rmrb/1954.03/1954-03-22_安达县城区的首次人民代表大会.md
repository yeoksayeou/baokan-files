    The First People's Congress of Anda County's Urban District
    The urban district of Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, convened its first People's Congress in late October of last year. In addition to electing the district head, deputy district head, and members of the district people's government, the congress focused on the characteristics of urban production at the time, taking the development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign as its central topic. It deeply addressed the problems existing in urban handicraft and sideline production, clarified the direction for the development of handicraft production, and promoted the experience of master-apprentice contracts. This improved master-apprentice relationships and public-private relationships, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of handicraftsmen. The congress also discussed and studied how to organize the market, expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and meet the supply of production and livelihood materials for farmers.
    The congress fully implemented the spirit of democracy, seriously examined the work of the district people's government in the past period, criticized the bureaucracy in the district leadership, and improved the leadership style. People's proposals were carefully handled in conjunction with the central topic. The congress was relatively successful and gained the following main experiences:
    Before the meeting, representatives widely publicized the powers and functions of the People's Congress and deeply collected proposals from the masses.
    In order to make the masses pay enough attention to the People's Congress and to enable the representatives to bring the opinions of the people to the congress, the leading comrades explained the working methods and publicity content to the representatives before the meeting. The working methods mainly clarified how the representatives should contact the voters and collect proposals. The publicity content mainly explained two things: one was the central content of this People's Congress, what problems to solve (linking it with the demands of the masses); the other was to publicize the powers and functions of the People's Congress in conjunction with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Initially, the representatives found that the masses had three ideological situations: most of the masses dared to boldly criticize the work of the government and put forward opinions, such as exposing the theft by a staff member of the county people's government and the illegal facts of wrongful arrest, detention, and torture to extract confessions by the head of the railway public security station; some people believed that many opinions had been put forward in the past People's Congress meetings, but the improvement was not great, "this time it will not work either," holding a negative attitude; a few people did not dare to put forward opinions, fearing retaliation. In response to this situation, the leadership took the following measures: those who actively put forward opinions were commended to drive the masses through them, so that the masses could establish confidence and correct their understanding. At the same time, individual visits were conducted to explain policies and improve the understanding of the masses.
    Before the meeting, the leadership had focused on assisting the representatives to organize voter seminars to help the representatives learn working methods and collect proposals. The methods were: 1. According to needs, one or two cadres were assigned by the district to assist the representatives in their work according to the electoral district or area. 2. Proposals were collected in a focused manner according to class, industry, unit, and voter group, so that the collected proposals were both broad and concentrated. 3. The representatives united with activists to organize voters to put forward proposals. During the deliberation of proposals, the masses believed that problems that could be solved by themselves could be solved by the masses themselves, and there was no need to put them forward as proposals.
    The representatives also conducted individual visits with a specific goal before the meeting to supplement the shortcomings of the seminars. For example, the representatives of Second Street collected more than 100 proposals from the masses through activists.
    After a series of activities such as the above-mentioned publicity and collection of proposals, the relationship between the representatives and the masses became closer, and the consciousness of the masses was further improved. In the past, the masses were still a little restrained when they approached the county head. This time, after the county head was elected as a people's representative of the urban district, the voters were willing to approach him, saying: In the past, we were not used to getting close to you. This time we elected you as a representative with our own hands, and we will tell you everything in person! Therefore, the masses actively reflected their opinions to the representatives, and more than 1,000 proposals were collected in the entire urban district in a few days.
    Concentrate efforts to solve the key problems of handicraft and sideline production, and further promote the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign.
    Handicraft production accounted for a large proportion of Anda's urban area, but at that time, there were many problems in handicraft production, which affected the development of handicraft production. Private handicraftsmen were unclear about the direction of business development and had many concerns, such as believing that handicraft production had no future, "fearing to develop into capitalists," and "fearing national industrialization." This affected the normal operation of handicraftsmen, forming phenomena such as "stopping work and waiting for materials in the off-season and producing shoddy goods in the peak season" and speculation. The master-apprentice relationship was also abnormal. Businessmen simply exploited apprentices without teaching them skills; apprentices had low wages, were uneasy, and had high mobility. Because businessmen were unclear about the prospects for development, none of the 23 blacksmith shops in the entire urban district had recruited an apprentice for more than a year. The leadership of public enterprises over private handicrafts was also insufficient. Some public enterprises arbitrarily raised prices when supplying raw materials to handicrafts; last autumn, the county supply and marketing cooperative went to other places to process horse-drawn furniture, while local private handicraftsmen also made a batch, resulting in a surplus of products. The county supply and marketing cooperative had to sell them at low prices, and private products were unsalable and suffered losses. Due to the above reasons, handicraft industry in Anda's urban area was in a chaotic state. Last year, ten blacksmith shops changed their business, causing a shortage of horseshoes in the urban area, and the supply could not meet the demand. The products of leather shops and cart shops were of poor quality and insufficient quantity, and could not meet the needs of farmers. According to this situation, the congress concentrated its efforts to solve the following problems.
    1. According to the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, the policy of developing handicraft production was correctly implemented. The difference between labor-capital relations, master-apprentice relations, and employment relations was emphasized, and the negative emotions of some handicraftsmen who believed that handicrafts had no future after the development of large industries, as well as the erroneous ideas and behaviors of simply relying on government support or engaging in speculation, were reversed. The representatives of the trade union made self-criticism at the congress on the biases and shortcomings of trade union work in private enterprises, explaining that trade union work must implement the policy of developing production, and at the same time, according to the actual situation and specific conditions, protect the welfare of workers, and criticized the workers' erroneous understanding of treating businessmen as capitalists; explained to some businessmen the one-sided view that trade unions simply seek welfare for workers. Apprentice representatives criticized the apprentices' bad attitude towards learning apprenticeships at the meeting, and also exposed the speculative behavior of some businessmen who used coarse materials to top fine materials and deceive farmers. Handicraft representatives also made a deep examination of the speculative behavior of unfair business practices between industries on behalf of the businessmen.
    2. Corrected the master-apprentice relationship, examined and criticized the mistakes of past master-apprentice contracts that were not in line with reality and violated policies. At the meeting, the master-apprentice contract in the iron industry was discussed and promoted in an organized manner in the handicraft group. This contract can ensure the establishment of new master-apprentice relationships and new management systems. The contract stipulates that the master should break the conservative thinking, patiently teach the apprentice, and advocate the publicizing of technology; it stipulates the learning technical standards, and stipulates that a master-apprentice technology seminar should be held every two weeks. The contract also stipulates that apprentices should abide by labor discipline and obey the master's allocation and leadership of work. The master's teaching of apprentices should be oral, manual, and mental, and should be taught well, quickly, and completely; apprentices should be focused, humble, and confident in learning technology, and advocate respecting teachers and loving apprentices. This fundamentally eliminated the businessmen's fear of recruiting apprentices.
    3. Strengthen the leadership of handicraft production and improve public-private relations. The congress decided that state-owned enterprises should actively lead private handicrafts, improve processing, ordering, and consignment and agency purchases, and support the development of local handicrafts. During the meeting, state-owned enterprises helped leather shops buy more than 170 cattle hides, ensuring the supply of winter felt boots needed by farmers; and purchased 100 colored wood red axles for the wood industry. The county supply and marketing cooperative and private handicraftsmen revised the processing and ordering plan for the fourth quarter of 1953, ordering 80 flower wheel carts for the wood industry and 60 sets of car rivers and car parts for the iron industry, and supplying 10,000 catties of iron for horseshoe use. A total of more than 800 million yuan was added to the processing and ordering value of iron, leather, wood, and weaving industries. At the same time, struggles to learn technology and oppose bad tendencies were launched among various industries.
    The main sideline production of urban residents is paper reeds and reed mats. However, at present, the enthusiasm of the masses for sideline production is not high. There is a sense of satisfaction that "there is no shortage of food and clothing," and it is believed that beating reeds is hard work and earns little money, while some households in difficulty cannot afford sideline production and rely on government relief and loans. In response to this situation, the congress adopted the following solutions: 1. Conducted education on patriotic increase in production and practicing economy, and systematically summarized the experience of sideline production in recent years, as well as the significant role of sideline production in improving and improving the lives of residents. 2. Put forward a sideline production plan and methods to ensure the completion of the plan, and conducted full discussion, supplementation, and revision among the representatives. The main contents of the plan are: to determine to organize all urban women, full labor force, and semi-labor force to participate in beating reeds and weaving mats as much as possible, to launch a production competition, and to strive to beat 2,700 tons of reeds and weave 120,600 mats in the entire urban district this spring, in order to increase income by 1.65 billion yuan. 3. Promoted the typical experience of sideline production. The congress exchanged experiences in beating reeds, weaving mats, and raising dairy cows. 4. Solved the difficulties of households in difficulty in engaging in sideline production. The representatives discussed and determined to use the method of joint weaving mats and joint sales to organize households in difficulty into mat weaving groups, and determined to sign contracts with the county supply and marketing cooperative in advance, and receive 25% of the loan in advance.
    Seriously handle proposals
    The congress sorted and classified the received proposals, and handled them differently according to the different nature of the proposals. Proposals related to increasing production and practicing economy were resolved through the discussion of the central topic of the congress (mainly the problems of handicraft and sideline production); criticisms of government work and cadre style, as well as proposals for various work suggestions, were immediately reviewed and corrected in 343 cases; 115 proposals that were divorced from reality, could not be done temporarily, or the situation was unclear were explained to the representatives separately; the reasons for the seven cases that the situation had been clarified but involved criminal conviction issues and could not be dealt with immediately were explained to the representatives, and a deadline for handling them after the meeting was set; cases involving major issues or exceeding the scope of the district were submitted to the county for research and reply.
    Launch criticism and self-criticism, and summarize and check the work of the government.
    In the government work report, the congress summarized and checked the achievements in supporting the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea and national construction in recent years, especially systematically summarized the achievements of the construction of people's democratic power in the urban area in recent years, affirmed the achievements, and criticized the shortcomings. The representatives, in conjunction with the discussion of the current government work, analyzed the officialism and bureaucratic style of the district leadership, the failure to grasp the central issues in the work, and the mandatory orders of the street cadres, such as seriously criticizing the erroneous practice in the 1952 Patriotic Health Campaign, in which the masses could not complete the rat-killing plan, and the cadres launched a struggle meeting, which forced the masses to take radish roots to top the task. The congress also deeply examined the "five excesses" phenomenon in the district and street governments. In the past, various units directly under the county arbitrarily assigned tasks to the streets without going through the district government, forming multiple leaderships. For example, at a street cadre meeting in late September last year, 12 tasks were assigned by eight units, making the street cadres busy. After this congress, the newly elected members of the district people's government and street cadres held a joint meeting, combined with the current work, and conducted a self-examination from the bottom up on the "five excesses" phenomenon; the district head reviewed the past random publication of forms, random apportionment, unclear instructions on the scope of work of street cadres, random task assignment by various assistants of the district government, and decentralized phenomena such as lax control. The congress also made a resolution to improve the work of the district and street governments.

    安达县城区的首次人民代表大会
    黑龙江省安达县城区在去年十月底召开了第一次人民代表大会。这次大会除选举了城区正、副区长和区人民政府委员外，并针对当时城镇生产的特点，以开展增产节约运动为中心议题，深入地解决了城区手工业和副业生产中存在的问题，明确了手工业生产发展的方向，推广了师徒合同的经验，从而改善了师徒关系和公私关系，大大提高了手工业者的生产积极性。大会并讨论和研究了如何组织市场，扩大城乡物资交流，满足农民生产、生活资料的供应工作等问题。
    大会充分贯彻了民主精神，认真检查了过去一个时期区人民政府的工作，批评了区领导上的官僚主义，改进了领导作风。对于人民提案，大会结合中心议题作了认真的处理。大会开得比较成功，并获得如下主要经验：
    会前通过代表广泛宣传人民代表大会的职权、作用，深入群众搜集提案
    为了使群众对人民代表大会引起足够的重视，并使代表把人民群众的意见带到代表大会上来，会前即由领导同志向代表交代了工作方法和宣传内容。工作方法主要讲明代表应当怎样和选民联系，搜集提案；宣传内容主要交代两件事：一是这次人民代表大会的中心内容，要解决什么问题（和群众的要求联系起来）；一是结合增产节约运动宣传人民代表大会的职权和作用。开始，代表发现群众有三种思想情况：大部分群众敢于大胆批评政府工作和提出意见，如揭发了县人民政府某工作人员偷东西，铁路公安驻在所所长错捕错押、严刑逼供的违法事实；有些人认为过去开人民代表会议曾提出不少意见，但改进不大，“这次提也不能顶事”，抱着消极态度；个别人则是有意见不敢提，怕报复。针对这种情况，领导上采取了以下办法：对积极提出意见的进行表扬，以通过他们带动群众，使群众树立信心，端正认识。同时也进行个别访问，交代政策，提高群众的认识。
    会前领导上曾有重点地协助代表组织了选民座谈讨论，以帮助代表学习工作方法，搜集提案。做法是：一、根据需要按选区或片由区配备一、二名干部协助代表工作。二、按阶层、行业、单位和选民小组，有重点地搜集提案，这样搜集的提案既广泛又集中。三、代表团结积极分子组织选民提出提案。酝酿提案过程中，群众认为能自己解决的问题，可通过群众自行解决，不必作为提案提出。
    代表在会前也曾有目标地进行了个别访问，以辅助座谈的不足。如二街代表通过积极分子进行个别访问，就搜集到群众提出的一百多条提案。
    代表经过上述宣传、搜集提案等一系列活动后，和群众的关系更加密切了，群众觉悟也得到进
  一步提高。过去群众和县长接近时还有些拘束，这次县长当选为城区人民代表后，选民都愿意和他接近，说：过去不惯靠近你，这回我们亲手把你选为代表，有啥事都当你面讲了！因此，群众积极向代表反映意见，几天的时间全城区就搜集了一千多件提案。
    集中力量解决手工业和副业生产的关键问题，进一步推动增产节约运动
    安达城区手工业生产占很大比重，但是，当时手工业生产中存在许多问题，影响了手工业生产的发展。私营手工业者对经营发展的方向不明确，存在很多顾虑，如认为手工业生产没有前途，“怕发展成资本家”，“怕国家工业化”，这样，就影响了手工业者的正常经营，形成了“淡季停工待料、旺季粗制滥造”以及投机捣把等现象。师徒关系也不正常。业者对徒弟单纯利用，不教技术；徒弟工资低，不安心，流动性大。业者因为对发展前途认识模糊，全城区二十三家铁匠炉，一年多没招收一个徒弟。公营企业对私营手工业的领导也不够。有的公营企业在供应手工业原料时随意提高价格；县供销合作社在去年秋季到外地加工辕马家具，而当地私营手工业者也做了一批，结果产品过剩，县供销合作社不得不低价出售，私人产品积压卖不出去，都受了损失。由于上述原因，安达城区手工业呈现纷乱状态。去年铁匠炉有十家转业，使城区马掌脱销，供不应求。皮铺、车铺等行业产品低劣，数量不足，不能满足农民的需要。大会根据这种情况集中力量解决了如下的问题。
    一、根据国家过渡时期总路线、总任务，正确地贯彻了发展手工业生产的政策。着重说明劳资关系、师徒关系、雇佣关系的区别，扭转了某些手工业者认为大工业发展后手工业没有前途的消极情绪，以及单纯依靠政府扶助或从事投机的错误思想和行为。工会代表在大会上对私营企业中工会工作的偏向和缺点作了自我批评，说明工会工作必须贯彻发展生产的方针，同时也要根据实际情况和具体条件来保障工人福利，批判了工人把业者当资本家看待的错误认识；对某些业者认为工会单纯为工人谋福利的片面看法作了解释。徒工代表在会上批评了徒工学徒的态度不好，同时也揭发了有的业者以粗材顶细材，欺骗农民的投机行为。手工业代表也代表业者深刻检查了行业间不正当经营的投机行为。
    二、端正了师徒关系，检查批判了过去师徒合同不切合实际和违反政策的错误，会上有组织地在手工业组讨论推广了铁业间的师徒合同。这种合同可以保证建立新的师徒关系和新的经营管理制度。合同中规定师父要打破保守思想，耐心教徒弟，提倡技术公开；规定了学习技术标准，并规定两星期开一次师徒技术研究会。合同也规定徒弟要遵守劳动纪律，听从师父对工作的分配与领导。师父教徒弟要嘴到、手到、心到，并且要教得好、快、全；徒弟学技术要安心、虚心、有信心，提倡尊师爱徒。这样就从根本上打消了业者不敢招徒弟的思想。
    三、加强对手工业生产的领导，改进公私关系。大会决定国营企业对私营手工业要积极领导，改善加工、订货和代销、代购工作，扶助当地手工业的发展。会议期间，国营企业帮助皮铺买进一百七十多张牛皮，保证了冬季农民所需靰鞡的供应；给木业代购色木红轴一百根。县供销合作社和私营手工业间修订了一九五三年第四季度的加工、订货计划，给木业增订花轮车八十台，铁业增订车川、车件子六十付，供应马掌用铁一万斤。共计给铁、皮、木、编织等行业增加加工、订货总值八亿多元。同时，各行业间展开了学习技术和反对不良倾向的斗争。
    城区居民的主要副业生产是纸苇、苇席。但目前群众搞副业生产的劲头不大，存在着“不缺吃不少穿”的满足情绪，认为打苇子费劲挣钱少，部分困难户则搞不起副业，依靠政府救济和贷款。针对这种情况，大会采取了如下解决办法：一、进行爱国增产节约的教育，系统地总结了几年来副业生产的经验，以及副业生产对提高与改善居民生活的重大作用。二、提出副业生产计划和保证完成计划的方法，并在代表中间进行了充分的讨论和补充修正。计划主要内容是：确定组织全城区妇女整劳力、半劳力尽量参加打苇、编席，展开生产竞赛运动，争取到今年春天全城区打苇二千七百吨，编席十二万零六百领，以增加收入十六亿五千万元。三、推广了副业生产的典型经验。大会交流了打苇、编席、养乳牛的经验。四、解决了困难户搞副业生产的困难。代表们讨论确定用联组编席、联组销售的办法，把困难户组织到编席组里，并确定提前和县供销合作社订立合同，先领百分之二十五的贷款。
    认真处理提案
    大会对收到的提案，作了整理分类，并按照提案的不同性质，分别进行了不同的处理。属于增产节约和生产方面的提案，通过大会中心议题的讨论得到了解决（主要是手工业和副业生产问题）；对政府工作和干部作风的批评，以及对各项工作建议的提案，立即检讨得到改正的有三百四十三件；脱离实际的，暂时不能办到的，或情况不清的提案共一百一十五件，分别向代表作了解释；情况虽已弄清，但牵扯到刑事判罪问题，不能立即处理的七件，向代表说明了原因，会后约期处理；有关重大问题或已超出本区范围的案件，交县研究处理后答复。
    展开批评与自我批评，总结检查政府工作
    大会在政府工作报告中总结检查了几年来支援抗美援朝和国家建设的成绩，特别是系统地总结了城区几年来人民民主政权建设的成就，肯定了成绩，批判了缺点。代表结合讨论当前政府工作，分析了区的领导方面的事务主义和官僚主义作风，在工作中抓不住中心问题以及街干部强迫命令等缺点，如严肃批判了在一九五二年爱国卫生运动中，群众完不成打耗子计划，干部便发起斗争会，致使群众被迫拿萝卜根顶任务的错误作法。大会也深刻检查了区街政权中的“五多”现象。过去县直属各单位不经区政府而任意向街道布置任务，形成多头领导。如去年九月下旬在一次街干部会上，就有八个单位布置了十二件工作，弄得街干部手忙脚乱。这次大会之后，新选的区人民政府委员及街干部举行了联席会议，结合当前工作，对“五多”现象又作了自下而上的检查；区长检讨了过去乱发表格，乱摊派，对街干部工作范围指示不清，区政府各助理员乱布置任务，以及控制不严等分散主义的现象。大会并做出了改进区街政府工作的决议。
