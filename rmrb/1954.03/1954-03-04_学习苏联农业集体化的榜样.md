Learning from the Example of Soviet Agricultural Collectivization
辛凤

After reading "The Road to Communism," published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House, I was greatly educated. The author, Fyodor Ivanovich Dubkovetsky, one of the founders of the collective farm movement in Ukraine, vividly described his arduous experience in creating collective farms, pointing out that only by taking the path of cooperation and collectivization can the small-peasant economy finally escape poverty, continuously increase yields, increase income, improve living standards, and advance along the bright road of socialism and communism.

As everyone knows, the rural economy in the early days of the Soviet Union was even more dispersed than before the October Socialist Revolution. In 1918, there were approximately 16 to 17 million peasant households in Russia, but by 1928, there were 25 million. Such dispersed farmers, as Lenin pointed out, cannot escape poverty, and "if we continue to live by relying on small farms, even with the status of free citizens on free land, we are bound to perish." This truth is proven by the vivid facts written by the author of "The Road to Communism." In this book, the author first describes the miserable situation of individual farmers working hard on their tiny fields and barely getting enough to eat, drawing the sincere conclusion that "land can not only be a loving mother but also a vicious stepmother."

For the dispersed and small-scale peasant economy, Lenin and Stalin pointed out the way out through cooperation and collectivization. Stalin said in his report to the 15th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party: "The way out lies in gradually, yet consistently, not by compulsory methods, but by demonstration and persuasion, uniting small and extremely small farms into large farms, based on public, collective farming, while adopting agricultural machinery and tractors, and adopting scientific methods to increase agricultural intensity." The "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm, written about in "The Road to Communism," took this correct path. The members of this farm not only achieved a prosperous material life and improved their cultural level but also persuaded individual farmers with their practical examples, developed the collectivization movement in rural areas, and became the "socialist lighthouse in the countryside" of Ukraine at that time. This is a living example for our country's farmers to learn from today.

The author of "The Road to Communism" was a Red Army soldier who retired in 1921 after defeating foreign armed intervention. Following Lenin's and Stalin's instructions on agricultural cooperation and collectivization, he initiated the organization of the first collective farm in Uman County, Kiev Province, Ukraine. He served as the chairman of this farm and was twice elected as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1946 and 1950, and visited Poland and Czechoslovakia. Recalling his election as a representative to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in 1946, he said: "Could my parents have imagined that their son would make a name for himself? In their eyes, it would have been the greatest happiness for me to be a clerk in the village office." However, under the education and cultivation of the Party and the Soviet regime, he has become a "statesman." He said, "At this time, I thought of Moscow, of Red Square where Lenin's mausoleum is located. How should I thank him!"

Dubkovetsky's wife, Dusha Chuban, is one of the outstanding rural women from a poor peasant background, and is a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. She has worked in the fields, in cow sheds and pigsties, as a nursery director, and as a vegetable team leader. In 1935, she was elected as a delegate to the Second All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers, and participated in the discussion of the formulation of the model charter for agricultural labor associations. This Ukrainian female "statesman" is still a production team leader, and her production team's yields are much higher than those of other production teams in the farm. In 1947, the average corn yield of the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm was 28 centners (one centner equals 200 jin) per hectare (one hectare equals 15 mu), while Dusha's production team harvested an average of 51 centners per hectare from three hectares of land; in 1949, the average sugar beet yield of the collective farm was 288.7 centners per hectare, while the production team led by Dusha harvested an average of 515 centners per hectare on three hectares of land. She used such practical production achievements to educate other farmers.

Under the leadership and education of the Party and the Soviet government, and with the lead of advanced farmers, the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm quickly developed. With the continuous improvement of the farm's production level, the living standards of the villagers also continuously improved. Practical life is the best textbook, and the villagers and individual farmers have been further profoundly educated. In 1949, when Polish peasant representatives visited the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm, they said well: "A farmer who does not have to worry about food, clothing, and housing for tomorrow, and who can think about installing running water in his house, and decide what style of motorcycle or radio to buy, can be called a happy farmer." Because of this, people who originally lacked confidence in the collective farm now sincerely support it. Anton Berenki and his wife, who had previously been unwilling to join the collective farm, became enthusiastic propagandists for agricultural collectivization. Some villagers, because their income increased, regarded the milk cows they had kept for themselves as a burden and gave them to the collective farm. This is easy to understand. If the members of the collective farm are guaranteed for all their needs, they will regard the personal poultry, livestock, and small plots of land next to their houses as a burden.

"The Road to Communism" tells us that the rapid development and huge harvests of the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm were not easily obtained, but were the result of the hard work of the farm's leaders and all the villagers. It developed from nine families, six horses, three plows, six harrows, two carts, and 51 hectares of public land in 1922. It experienced the test of the Great Patriotic War, was ravaged by Hitler's bandits, and was rebuilt on the ruins after the war. Under the leadership of Dubkovetsky, it overcame all difficulties with its own labor, repaired various machines, carried out diligent cultivation, and the harvest was still only an average of 15 centners of grain per hectare. From 1946 to 1947, they painstakingly built their own hydroelectric power station, turned scrap iron into machines, divided the work for cultivation and construction, conquered the Tigich River that flowed through the farm, and began electrification. Since then, they have used 22 electric motors to cut grass, cut radishes, grind, fan the forge's bellows, saw wood, extract oil, and other work, and mobilized threshing machines, windmills, and grain cleaners to reduce physical labor in harvesting. After one year, the hydropower station had an income of 148,000 rubles. After three years, they had 40 electric motors performing 60 kinds of work. The "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm planned to harvest 29 centners of grain per hectare in the last year of the second post-war five-year plan.

"The Road to Communism" is a vivid textbook for conducting socialist education among the vast number of farmers in our country today. The 30-year experience of the "October Revolution Achievements" collective farm illuminates the development prospects of our country's agriculture and can encourage our country's farmers to unswervingly advance along the path of cooperation and collectivization. As the author of the book said: "Our country's tomorrow not only tempts us, but also tempts all advanced mankind. The people of the new democratic countries of the East and the West have already advanced, imitating our example."

    学习苏联农业集体化的榜样
    辛凤
    读了莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版的“到共产主义之路”一书，我受到极大的教育。作者费多尔·伊万诺维奇·杜布科维茨基是乌克兰集体农庄运动创始人之一，他生动地描述了艰苦缔造集体农庄的经历，指明了小农经济只有走合作化、集体化的道路，才能最后摆脱贫困，不断提高收获量，增加收入，改善生活，才能沿着社会主义和共产主义的光明大道迈进。
    大家知道，苏联在建国初期的农村经济，比十月社会主义革命以前更加分散。一九一八年的俄国农户约为一千六、七百万户，而到一九二八年，却有二千五百万农户。这样分散的农民，正如列宁所指出的，是不能摆脱贫困的，而且“如果我们仍旧依靠小农庄来生活，那怕是以自由土地上的自由公民资格来生活，也是不免要灭亡的”。这个真理被“到共产主义之路”的作者所写的活生生的事实证明了。作者在本书中首先叙述了个体农民在自己细小的田庄上辛勤耕作而难得一饱的悲惨情况，得出了这样真切的结论：“土地不仅能成为慈爱的母亲，而且也能成为恶毒的后娘。”
    对于分散的、细小的小农经济，列宁、斯大林指示了合作化、集体化的出路。斯大林在苏联共产党第十五次代表大会的报告中说：“出路就在于循序渐进，然而一贯到底地，不是用强迫方法，而是用示范和说服方法，把小的和极小的农庄联合为大的农庄，以公共的共耕式的集体的耕种制做基础，同时采用农业机器和拖拉机，采用增加农业强度的科学方法。”“到共产主义之路”一书中所写的“十月革命成果”集体农庄，正是走了这条正确的道路。这个农庄的成员们，不但本身取得了富裕的物质生活，提高了文化水平，而且以自己的实际范例说服了个体农民，发展了农村中的集体化运动，而成为当时乌克兰“农村中的社会主义灯塔”。这是今天我国农民应该学习的活榜样。
    “到共产主义之路”的作者，是一九二一年战胜了外国武装干涉后退伍的红军战士。他遵循列宁、斯大林关于农业合作化、集体化的指示，发起组织乌克兰基辅省乌曼县的第一个集体农庄。他一直担任这个农庄的主席，曾在一九四六年和一九五○年两次当选苏联最高苏维埃代表，并到波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参观过。他在回忆一九四六年当选苏联最高苏维埃代表时说：“我的父母难道想到过他们的儿子会出人头地么？在他们看来，我若能在村公所当一个司书，就算是最大的幸福了。”然而在党和苏维埃政权的教育和培养下，他已经成为“国务活动家”了。他说：“这时我就想起了莫斯科，想起了列宁长眠着的陵墓所在地方的红场。我该怎样向他致谢啊！”
    杜布科维茨基的爱人杜霞·楚班，是贫农出身的杰出的农村妇女之一，是乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国苏维埃中央执行委员。她曾在田地上、在牛栏和猪圈里作过工，当过托儿所主任，当过种菜队长。她在一九三五年当选出席全苏第二次集体农庄突击队员代表大会的代表，参加制订农业劳动组合模范章程的讨论。这个乌克兰的女“国务活动家”，仍然是一个生产队长，她的生产队的收获量比农庄其他生产队的收获量要多得多。一九四七年，“十月革命成果”集体农庄的玉蜀黍收获量，平均每公顷（等于十五市亩）二十八公担（每公担等于二百市斤），而杜霞的生产队却从三公顷土地上，平均每公顷收了五十一公担；一九四九年，集体农庄的糖萝卜收获量，平均每公顷二百八十八点七公担，而杜霞领导的生产队，在三公顷土地上，平均每公顷收了五百十五公担。她就用这样的实际生产成绩教育其他的农民。
    在党和苏维埃政府的领导和教育下，在先进农民的带头下，“十月革命成果”集体农庄很快地发展起来了。跟着农庄的生产水平的不断提高，庄员们的生活水平也不断地提高了。实际生活是最好的教科书，农庄庄员和个体农民都进一步受到了深刻的教育。一九四九年波兰农民代表到“十月革命成果”集体农庄参观时说得好：“一个农民既不用焦虑明天的衣食住问题，而能想使自己住房内安设有自来水管，决定要买什么样式的摩托车或收音机等，那末他就满可称为是幸福的农民了。”正因为如此，原来对集体农庄缺乏信心的人，现在也诚心拥护集体农庄了。过去曾经不愿加入集体农庄的庄员安东·贝连基和他的妻子，成了农业集体化的热心的宣传家。有的庄员，因为自己收入多了，把留给自己的乳牛也当作累赘而送给集体农庄了。这是容易理解的。集体农庄庄员如果对自己的一切需求都有了保证，就会把属于个人的家禽、家畜和住屋旁边小块土地当成累赘了。
    “到共产主义之路”告诉我们：“十月革命成果”集体农庄的迅速发展和巨大收获，不是轻易得到的，而是农庄的领导人和全体庄员们的艰苦奋斗的结果。它是由一九二二年的九家人、六匹马、三把犁、六把耙、两辆大车和五十一公顷公有土地发展起来的。它经历了伟大的卫国战争的考验，受到希特勒匪徒的蹂躏，在战后的废墟上重建起来。它在杜布科维茨基的领导下，用自己的劳动战胜了一切困难，修理好了各种机器，进行辛勤的耕作，收获量还只有平均每公顷十五公担谷物。他们从一九四六年到一九四七年的一年间，千辛万苦地建造了自己的水力发电站，把废铁变成了机器，分工进行耕作和建筑，征服了流过农庄的梯吉奇河，开始了电气化。从此，它就用了二十二部电气摩托来进行切草、切萝卜、推磨、搧作坊的风箱、锯木、榨油和其他工作，发动打谷机、风车和清谷机来减轻收获工作中的体力劳动。过了一年，水电站有了十四万八千卢布的收入。过了三年，他们有了四十架电气摩托进行着六十种工作。“十月革命成果”集体农庄计划到战后第二个五年计划的末一年，将在一公顷土地上收获二十九公担谷物。
    “到共产主义之路”是对今天我国广大农民进行社会主义教育的生动的教本，“十月革命成果”集体农庄三十年来的经历，照亮了我国农业的发展前途，能够鼓舞我国农民坚定不移地沿着合作化、集体化的道路前进。正如本书作者所说：“我国的明天不仅引诱着我们，而且引诱着全体先进人类。仿照着我国榜样迈进的，已有东方和西方各新民主主义国家的人民。”
