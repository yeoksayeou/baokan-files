Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 28th: Rogov wrote an article in "News" commenting on the decision of the Berlin Conference to convene a meeting in Geneva with the five major powers and other relevant countries.

Rogov wrote: The decision to convene the Geneva Conference convincingly proves that no one can now ignore the position and role of the People's Republic of China in international life. This decision actually means recognizing the People's Republic of China as a major power. The agreement to convene the Geneva Conference was reached at the initiative of the Soviet Union. This initiative of the Soviet Union has been widely supported and enthusiastically endorsed by peace-loving people of all countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that the Indian government welcomes the statement of the four foreign ministers on convening the Geneva Conference.

Rogov continued: The agreement on convening the Geneva Conference has been warmly received by foreign newspapers. Newspapers of various tendencies have pointed out the significance of this agreement. The London "Times" in its editorial described the decision to convene the Geneva Conference as a "reasonable compromise." Newspapers in Asian and Far Eastern countries attached particular importance to this decision. The Indian newspaper "Lokmanya" believes that the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference is "a major factor in resolving international problems."

Rogov pointed out: The reaction of the reactionary American newspapers to the agreement on convening the Geneva Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China and other directly related countries is completely opposite to world opinion. The reaction of the reactionary American newspapers shows that the American aggressive bloc is determined to continue to obstruct the relaxation of international tensions. Therefore, the reactionary American commentators "warn" public opinion not to be "overly optimistic" about the Geneva Conference, deliberately casting doubt on whether the Geneva Conference can be successful. For example, the "New York Times" said in an editorial: "The upcoming Geneva Conference is actually just a continuation of our past negotiations in Korea." Rogov pointed out: It is not difficult to see that the "New York Times" is speaking on behalf of Americans who are alarmed by the Korean armistice and by the possibility of establishing peace in Indochina, because they want to rely on huge military orders and continued arms expansion to fill their pockets, increase profits and excess profits.

Rogov concluded: However, the demands of the broad masses of people and the interests of large and small countries are opposed to the plans of the aggressive forces. People demand to defend peace and try to eliminate international tensions. Convening the Geneva Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China is in line with the wishes of the people of all countries. The people of all countries hope that the conference will achieve positive results.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 2nd: Ajoy Kumar Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, issued a statement on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

Ghosh pointed out: Although the imperialists created almost insurmountable difficulties for the Berlin Conference, the Berlin Conference should be regarded as a sign of the growing strength of the forces of peace.

Ghosh praised the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace. He said that the Soviet Union "put forward concrete and constructive proposals for peace, thus expressing the urgent demand of the people all over the world for peace. These proposals of the Soviet Union have been obstructed by the imperialists at every stage, especially by the United States. It is for this reason that the Berlin Conference has not been able to meet people's expectations of it."

Ghosh also said: "However, it would be wrong to regard the conference as a failure. The very fact that the imperialist countries were forced to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is an achievement of the peace-loving people. Moreover, the decision to convene the Geneva Conference to finally resolve the Korean issue and to consider restoring peace in Indochina is of great significance."

Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: Tass, Rome, February 28th: "Rinascita" Weekly published an editorial by Togliatti commenting on the Berlin Conference.

The editorial said: The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference has two achievements: the first achievement is: a new international conference will be convened in the short term to solve the pressing Far East issues. Representatives of the great People's Republic of China will participate in this conference on an equal footing. This result is concrete and obvious to everyone. The second achievement of the Berlin Conference is: after this conference, the situation has been clarified, and there is a better understanding of each other's positions. Only those who turn a blind eye to the increasing importance of consultation and peaceful resolution of international issues in public opinion will not understand the significance of this achievement. Here we are not only referring to the peace movement, which has become a pivotal international force, but we also see that the representatives and rulers of the bourgeoisie in countries like Britain and France have had to change their positions to meet the demands of public opinion. Because the public opinion in these countries is indignant at the actions of their governments in failing to safeguard national interests and succumbing to the US imperialist war policy, and they yearn for tranquility and peace.

Until today, the US imperialists have still not been able to force Europe to adopt their plan to completely revive German militarism under the guise of the "European Army". It can be predicted that after the Berlin Conference, the US imperialists will definitely increase their pressure to achieve something in this regard. However, it must be pointed out that the resistance of public opinion will also increase more than before.

Togliatti concluded: The Soviet Union's proposition to guarantee European security will quickly gain widespread support among the people of European countries.

Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd: Newspapers in Ceylon, Indonesia and other countries continue to publish comments welcoming the agreement on convening the Geneva Conference reached at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The Colombo "Tribune" of Ceylon commented on the Berlin Conference on February 25th under the title "Berlin and Potsdam", believing that this is a new hope for easing world tensions. The "Tribune" said: "The true representatives of China finally have their due place among the universally recognized great powers. This alone is a great victory for the forces of peace."

The Indonesian "People's Daily" commented: "The success of the Berlin Conference is a great victory for the forces of peace, which has shattered the US government's desire to turn this year into a year of war. This year will be transformed into a year of negotiation or a year of peace."

The "Independent" wrote: "For Indonesia, the resolution of the Berlin Conference is a welcome thing. Peace in Asia is of direct interest to Indonesia." The newspaper believes that "it is unrealistic to solve Asian problems without the participation of the People's Republic of China."

The "Indonesian News" said: "The easing of tensions in Asia can pave the way for solving the tension in Europe."

    世界舆论欢迎召开日内瓦会议
    指出我国参加会议有助于解决迫切的国际问题
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二月二十八日讯：罗果夫在“消息报”著文评论柏林会议通过的关于在日内瓦召开五大国及其他有关国家的会议的决议。
    罗果夫写道：关于召开日内瓦会议的决议令人信服地证明，现在谁也不能忽视中华人民共和国在国际生活中的地位和作用了。这一决议实际上意味着承认中华人民共和国这个大国。关于召开日内瓦会议的协议是在苏联的倡议下达成的。苏联这一倡议得到各国爱好和平的人民的广泛拥护和热烈支持。印度总理尼赫鲁说，印度政府欢迎四国外长关于召开日内瓦会议的声明。
    罗果夫接着写道：关于召开日内瓦会议的协议得到外国报纸的热烈反应。各种倾向的报纸都指出了这一协议的意义。伦敦“泰晤士报”在社论中把关于召开日内瓦会议的决议说成是一种“合理的妥协”。亚洲和远东各国的报纸特别重视这一决议。印度报纸“洛克曼雅报”认为，中华人民共和国的参加日内瓦会议，是“解决国际问题的主要因素之
  一”。
    罗果夫指出：美国的反动报纸对关于召开有中华人民共和国和其他直接有关国家参加的日内瓦会议的协议的反应，是和世界舆论完全对立的。美国反动报纸的反应说明，美国侵略集团执意继续阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。因此，美国的反动评论家
  “警告”舆论不要对日内瓦会议“过分乐观”，故意使人怀疑日内瓦会议能否获得成功。例如，“纽约时报”在社论中说：“即将举行的日内瓦会议，实际上只不过是我们过去在朝鲜举行的谈判的继续。”罗果夫指出：不难看出，“纽约时报”是在代表美国这样一种人在说话的，这种人由于朝鲜停战、由于看到在印度支那也有建立和平的可能而惊恐不安，因为他们要靠庞大的军事订货和继续扩充军备，来填满他们的私囊，增加利润和超额利润。
    罗果夫最后说：然而，各国广大人民群众的要求和大小国家的利益是和侵略势力的计划对立的。人民要求保卫和平，设法消除国际紧张局势。召开有中华人民共和国参加的日内瓦会议是符合各国人民的愿望的。各国人民希望会议获得积极的结果。
    【新华社新德里二日电】印度共产党总书记阿约艾·库马尔·高士就柏林四国外长会议的结果发表声明。
    高士指出：尽管帝国主义者为柏林会议制造了几乎难以克服的困难，柏林会议应该被认为是和平势力日益壮大的标志。
    高士盛赞苏联一贯的和平政策。他说，苏联“为了和平，提出了具体的、建设性的建议，因此表达了全世界人民对和平的迫切要求。苏联的这些建议，在每一个阶段都遭到了帝国主义者的阻挠，特别是美国的阻挠。就是为了这个原因，柏林会议没有能满足人们对它的期望。”
    高士又说：“然而，如果把会议认为是一个失败，那也是错误的。帝国主义国家被迫来参加四国外长会议，这件事实的本身就是爱好和平的人民的成就。不仅如此，召开日内瓦会议来最后解决朝鲜问题以及考虑恢复印度支那和平问题的决议，是有很大的意义的。”
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社罗马二月二十八日讯：“再生”周刊登载了陶里亚蒂写的评论柏林会议的社论。
    社论说：柏林四国外长会议有两个成就：第一个成就是：短期内即召开新的国际会议，以解决迫切的远东问题。伟大的中华人民共和国的代表并将以平等的地位参加这个会议。这个结果是具体的，对所有的人都是明显的。柏林会议的第二个成就是：经过这次会议，使局势澄清了，并更好地了解了彼此的立场。只有那些对于舆论日益重视协商与和平解决国际问题这件事熟视无睹的人，才会不明白这个成就的意义。这里我们指的不只是已经成为举足轻重的国际力量的和平运动，而且我们还看到，像英、法这样的国家的资产阶级的代表和统治者也不得不改变其立场以满足舆论的要求了。因为这些国家的舆论对于他们政府不维护民族利益、屈从美国帝国主义战争政策的行动表示愤慨，并渴望安宁与和平。
    直到今天，美帝国主义者仍然没有能够迫使欧洲采纳他们的在“欧洲军”幌子下完全复活德国军国主义的计划。可以预料，在柏林会议以后，美帝国主义者一定会要更加大施压力以便在这方面有所成就。然而必须指出，舆论的反抗也必将比以前增大。
    陶里亚蒂最后说：苏联保障欧洲安全的主张，将会在欧洲各国人民中间迅速得到广泛的拥护。
     【新华社二日讯】锡兰、印尼等国报纸继续发表评论，欢迎柏林四国外长会议关于召开日内瓦会议的协议。
    锡兰科伦坡的“特兰周报”于二月二十五日以“柏林与波茨坦”为题评论柏林会议，认为这是缓和世界紧张局势的新希望。“特兰周报”说：“中国的真正代表终于在众所承认的大国之间有了应有的地位。单是这一点就是和平力量的巨大胜利。”
    印尼“人民日报”评论写道：“柏林会议的成就是和平力量的巨大胜利，使美国政府想把今年变成战争年的愿望破灭了。今年将转变为谈判年或和平年。”
      “独立报”写道：“对印尼来说，柏林会议的决议是一件可喜的事，亚洲的和平对印尼有直接的利害关系。”该报认为，“解决亚洲问题而不要中华人民共和国参加，是不现实的。”
    “印尼新闻报”说：“亚洲紧张局势的缓和，可为解决欧洲的紧张问题打开道路。”
