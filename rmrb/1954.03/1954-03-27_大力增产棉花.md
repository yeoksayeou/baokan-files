    Vigorously Increase Cotton Production
    With the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's lives, the demand for cotton is also increasing day by day. Ensuring that there is sufficient cotton to meet the needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian wadding is one of the important long-term tasks in our country's agricultural production that cannot be ignored.
    In the past few years, the state has adopted a series of policies to encourage cotton planting, and party and government organs and agricultural departments in various regions have carried out many necessary political and economic work for cotton farmers, and supplied a large number of means of production and means of livelihood to cotton-producing areas. Cotton farmers across the country have played a positive and creative role in the patriotic production increase movement, which has enabled my country to achieve great achievements in increasing cotton production. By 1952, the cotton planting area had increased by 102 percent compared with 1949, and the total cotton output had increased by 191 percent, an increase of 52 percent compared with the highest year of pre-war cotton production (1936). The quality of cotton has also been significantly improved due to the large-scale promotion of improved varieties. All these achievements have enabled my country to gradually use domestically produced cotton to meet the needs of the cotton textile industry and civilian wadding, completely changing the situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, which relied solely on imports of American cotton. This is a major victory for us on the economic front.
    In 1953, in view of the rapid increase in cotton fields in the past and the potential of cultivated land had not been fully utilized, it was proposed that the cotton field area should be maintained at the 1952 level, and the focus should be on actively increasing the yield per unit area. It was correct to propose this policy at that time; however, some deviations occurred in the implementation of this policy: the trend of blind expansion of cotton fields was overestimated, and the cotton price was lowered too much when adjusting the cotton-grain price ratio; after emphasizing the importance of increasing grain production, there was a lack of due attention to the leadership of cotton production. The planned number of cotton plantings in 1953 was also less than that in 1952; in addition, there were some shortcomings in the purchase of cotton and the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, and the sudden suspension of cotton pre-purchase, etc., made many local cadres have the illusion that "there is too much cotton and there is no problem with production", which invisibly relaxed the leadership of cotton production, causing the masses to doubt the policy of continuing to increase cotton production. Therefore, the cotton field area in 1953 decreased by more than 6 million mu; the total output also failed to complete the scheduled plan. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will affect the completion of this year's cotton production tasks.
    At present, although my country's cotton production is much higher than before the war, it is not too much, but less, for a large country with a large population like ours. The increase in the demand for cotton yarn and cloth in recent years is a good illustration: if the national sales figures for cotton yarn and cloth in 1950 are 100, then 1951 is 173, 1952 is 230, and 1953 is 343. The growth rate in 1953 was the largest, but the production of cotton did not increase in 1953, only approaching the level of 1952. Obviously, an incompatibility between the two has begun to emerge. From this point of view, if cotton production cannot be increased accordingly, it will seriously affect the development of the cotton textile industry, it will not be possible to fully supply the people with various textiles and civilian cotton, and it may affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the normal progress of national construction work. Therefore, while vigorously increasing grain production, we must also vigorously increase cotton production. In particular, the leading party organs and people's governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas, as well as relevant departments, must create favorable conditions for increasing cotton production and ensure the completion of the planned cotton field area and the task of increasing cotton production. Increasing cotton production should focus on increasing the yield per unit area, as this is the basic method of increasing cotton production. However, according to the speed of the increase in people's demand for cotton, relying solely on increasing the yield per unit area cannot completely meet the needs at present. Therefore, in the next few years, on the basis of 1953, it is also very necessary to increase a certain amount of cotton field area year by year in areas suitable for cotton planting. My country has vast areas suitable for cotton planting. Although cotton fields have expanded a lot in recent years, in areas with a large cotton planting area, a part of cotton fields can still be expanded under the principle of ensuring proper rotation and solving feed problems, and cotton producing areas can be delineated. In many areas suitable for cotton planting with a small cotton planting area, the cotton field can also be increased after the local farmers' cotton planting technology is gradually improved. The coastal reclamation areas of Jiangsu and Shandong, and the North China and Xinjiang regions have large areas of wasteland that can be reclaimed for cotton planting, which can gradually be used as new cotton planting bases. In short, we must make full use of favorable conditions to expand new cotton fields.
    In order to increase a certain amount of cotton field area and increase cotton production year by year, it is necessary to implement various policies to encourage cotton planting. Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government announced the cotton-grain price ratio for 1954, and the cotton price has been appropriately increased; it also instructed to resume the pre-purchase of cotton, and the supply and marketing cooperatives and cotton farmers signed cotton pre-purchase contracts; it stipulated that the policy of equal burden on cotton fields and grain fields and the policy of using cotton to pay public grain in cotton fields must be implemented. There is no doubt that this will greatly stabilize and improve farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting. These policies should be quickly publicized to farmers, explaining that the amount of cotton needed by the state is increasing year by year, and the cotton produced must be purchased. It is explained that the state needs to do a lot of preparatory work for the purchase of cotton, so it must be purchased in installments and successively. This requires cotton farmers to sell cotton in installments and successively according to the state's purchase plan and the needs of the family. In order to compensate for the losses during the storage period of cotton sold later, the state has also stipulated reasonable seasonal price differences. It is explained that in the past few years, the broad masses of farmers have responded to the government's call to increase cotton production, which not only benefited themselves, but also supported the construction of industry, which is a great contribution to the country's industrialization. In the future, not only should cotton be planted according to the state's plan, but also cotton should be sold according to the state's plan. Only in this way is it a comprehensive manifestation of patriotism.
    Guiding cotton farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations is a reliable basis for improving the yield per unit area of cotton, and it is also a guarantee for implementing various policies. Because the individual small-scale peasant economy is weak, the increase in production is slow, and it cannot keep up with the growing demand for cotton. In recent years, the fact that the output of agricultural production cooperatives is higher than that of mutual aid groups, and the output of mutual aid groups is higher than that of individual households has proved the superiority of collective production in greatly increasing output. At the same time, because cotton is a commodity production, the economy in cotton-producing areas is developing rapidly. In the past, some wealthy cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas often hoarded cotton for sale or sold cotton to hoard grain, which fostered spontaneous capitalist trends. In order to overcome this trend, so that cotton farmers' production meets the needs of the country, they can produce and sell cotton in a planned way, and continuously expand agricultural production. It is of particular importance to organize cotton farmers to join mutual aid groups and cooperatives.
    At present, the output of various types of cotton-producing areas is generally still very low, and the difference in output is also very large, which shows that the potential for increasing cotton production is very large. In recent years, many high-yield cases have emerged in cotton-producing areas. For example, in the northern irrigated cotton area, the highest yield per mu has reached more than 1,000 jin of seed cotton. The average yield of cotton in large areas of northern dryland cotton areas and southern two-crop cotton areas has also reached an average of 160 jin to 180 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is more than one to ten times the national average yield. However, the unit yield of cotton in various places is extremely unbalanced. In many irrigated cotton areas, due to improper irrigation technology, the potential for increasing production has not been fully utilized, and some are even not as high as the yield of dryland cotton fields. New cotton areas have poor technology and low yields. Therefore, in addition to continuing to increase the output of high-yield areas, for low-yield cotton areas, coarse-lint cotton areas, and many irrigated cotton areas, it is also necessary to strengthen cotton planting technology guidance and increase their output, so that comprehensive production increase can be achieved.
    How to improve cotton planting technology? In addition to universally promoting successful advanced experience in various cotton-producing areas, special attention should be paid to exploring and promoting practical and feasible production-increasing technologies in light of local conditions. In this regard, the Jinghui Canal irrigated cotton area in Shaanxi Province is a good example. The area has more than 400,000 mu of irrigated cotton fields. In recent years, production has declined year after year. By 1952, the yield was not as high as that of dry land. The relevant departments of agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, etc. in the Northwest Region and Shaanxi Province, after repeated investigations and studies, and under the guidance of Soviet experts, analyzed the reasons for the decline in production over the years in light of the characteristics of this cotton area, and formulated a technical improvement plan, on the one hand, handed it over to the local farm for continued experimentation and research, and on the other hand, cooperated with the local party and government organs, mass organizations, etc. to lead farmers to steadily carry out technical improvements. In 1953, measures such as crop rotation, increased fertilization, winter irrigation, early spring irrigation, furrow irrigation, and early sowing were adopted. In the case of better natural conditions in 1953, the trend of declining year by year has been initially and effectively reversed, and the average yield per mu has doubled compared with 1952.
    The experience of the past few years has proved that: if the task of increasing cotton production and the price policy are explained to the grass-roots cadres and the masses before cotton sowing, the work of cotton purchase and pre-purchase is done well, the supply of materials such as cotton seeds, fertilizers, medicines and machinery is done well, and the grain supply for cotton farmers is guaranteed, so that cotton farmers can see the benefits of cotton planting, the enthusiasm of cotton farmers for cotton planting can be improved. Especially when many cadres and the masses still have some misunderstandings about increasing cotton production, it is even more important to do these tasks well. Therefore, the leading organs of the Party and the government, the cotton yarn and cloth companies, and the supply and marketing cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas must, on the basis of summarizing the cotton production work in 1953, in light of the local situation, and in combination with the publicity of the general line and general tasks, earnestly do the above work well. In addition, the leading organs of the Party and the government in various cotton-producing areas should also mobilize the masses to accumulate fertilizer, prepare land, prepare cotton seeds, and put forward different key points for technical improvement for different cotton areas, and use forums, training courses and other forms to conduct technical training for grass-roots cadres and farmers respectively, and do a good job in technical preparation. Local agricultural science research institutes and agricultural experiment stations should timely impart successful cotton planting experience to the masses. Only when all parties complete the above preparatory work, will the task of increasing cotton production in 1954 be guaranteed.

    大力增产棉花
    随着国民经济的发展和人民生活的不断提高，棉花的需要量也日益增加。保证有足够的棉花来满足棉纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要，是我国农业生产方面长期的不能忽视的重要任务之一。
    过去几年中，国家采取了一系列的奖励植棉的政策，各地党政机关及农业部门对棉农进行了许多必要的政治工作和经济工作，对棉区供应了大量的生产资料和生活资料，全国棉农在爱国增产运动中发挥了积极性和创造性，使我国的棉花增产取得了巨大的成绩。至一九五二年，棉田播种面积比一九四九年增加了百分之一百零二，棉花总产量增加了百分之一百九十一，比战前棉花总产量最高的一年（一九三六年）的产量增加了百分之五十二。棉花的品质，由于良种的大量推广，也有显著改进。这一切成就，使我国已能逐渐用自产的棉花来满足棉纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要，完全改变了国民党反动统治时期一味依赖美国棉花进口的情况。这是我们在经济战线上的一个重大胜利。
    一九五三年，鉴于过去棉田的增加很快，而耕地的潜力还未充分发挥，曾提出棉田面积应保持一九五二年的水平，积极地提高单位面积产量的方针。当时提出这个方针是正确的；但是，在贯彻这个方针的时候，却发生了一些偏差：过分估计了棉田盲目扩大的趋势，调整棉粮比价时将棉价降的偏低；在强调粮食增产的重要性以后，对棉花生产的领导缺乏应有的重视，一九五三年植棉计划数字，也少于一九五二年；加以在购棉和供应生产资料、生活资料中有若干缺点，并且突然停止了棉花预购等，就使很多地方的干部产生“棉花已太多，生产无问题”的错觉，无形中放松了对棉花增产的领导，使群众对继续增产棉花的政策发生了怀疑。因此，一九五三年的棉田面积减少了六百余万亩；总产量也没有完成预定计划。这种情况如不迅速改变，将影响今年棉花生产任务的完成。
    目前我国棉花产量，虽比战前大大提高，但对于我们这样一个人口众多的大国来说，还不是太多，而是少了。几年来棉纱布匹需要量的增长，就是很好的说明：如以一九五○年全国棉纱布匹销售数字为一百，则一九五一年为一七三，一九五二年为二三○，一九五三年为三四三。一九五三年的增长速度最大，但是棉花的生产量在一九五三年则没有增长，才接近一九五二年的水平。很显然，两者之间已开始显露了不能相适应的情况。由此看来，棉花生产量如果不能相适应地增加，将会严重地影响棉纺织工业的发展，就不能充分供应人民以各种纺织品和民间用棉，就可能影响到工农联盟的巩固和国家建设工作的正常进行。因此，在大力增产粮食的同时，还必须大力增产棉花。特别是产棉区的各级党的领导机关和人民政府，以及有关部门，必须为增产棉花创造有利条件，保证完成棉田计划面积和棉花增产任务。增加棉花产量，应当以提高单位面积产量为重点，因为这是提高棉花产量的基本方法。但是，根据人民对棉花需要增加的速度来看，目前仅仅依靠提高单位面积产量还不能完全满足需要。因此，今后若干年内，在一九五三年的基础上，在适宜植棉的地区逐年增加一定的棉田面积也是十分必要的。我国有广阔的适宜植棉地区。虽然几年来棉田已经扩大很多，但在植棉面积较多的地区，在保证能够适当轮作及解决饲料的原则下，仍可扩大一部分棉田，划定棉花产区。许多适宜植棉，棉田面积较少的地区，在当地农民植棉技术逐渐提高后，棉田也可以增加。江苏、山东沿海垦区，华北和新疆地区有大块可供开垦的荒地宜于植棉，可逐渐作为新的植棉基地。总之，我们必须充分利用有利条件，扩大新的棉田。
    为了逐年增加一定的棉田面积和提高棉花的产量，必须贯彻各种奖励种棉的政策。最近中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布了一九五四年的棉粮比价，对棉价已经适当提高；同时也指示了恢复对棉花的预购工作，由供销合作社和棉农订立棉花预购合同；规定了必须贯彻棉田粮田同等负担以及棉田以棉花抵交公粮的政策。毫无疑问，这会大大安定和提高农民的植棉情绪。应该迅速向农民宣传这些政策，说明国家需要的棉花是一年比一年增加的，生产的棉花是一定要收购的。说明国家收购棉花需要作好许多准备工作，因而要分期陆续收购。这就要求棉农也要按着国家的收购计划和家庭的需要陆续、分期地出售棉花。为了补偿后出售棉花在保管期间的损失，国家还规定了合理的季节差价。说明过去几年来，广大农民响应政府号召，增产棉花，不仅自己得了利益，而且支援了工业的建设，这是对国家工业化的一个很大贡献。今后不仅仍应当按照国家的计划种棉，还应当按照国家的计划出售棉花，只有这样才是全面的爱国的表现。
    引导棉农参加互助合作组织，是提高棉花的单位面积产量的可靠基础，同时也是贯彻各项政策的保证。因为个体的小农经济，力量是薄弱的，提高产量是缓慢的，赶不上人民对棉花日益增长的要求。几年来，农业生产合作社的产量比互助组高，互助组的产量比单干户高的事实，已证明集体生产可以大大提高产量的优越性。同时，由于棉花是商品生产，棉区经济发展较快，过去有些棉区的富裕棉农，常有囤棉不卖或售棉囤粮的现象，滋长了自发的资本主义趋势，为了克服这种趋势，使棉农的生产符合国家需要，有计划地生产和出售棉花，不断扩大农业生产，组织棉农加入互助组、合作社，就有特别重要的意义。
    目前各类不同产棉区的产量一般的都还很低，产量的高低相差也很大，这说明棉花增产的潜力是很大的。几年来在棉区涌现了许多丰产事例，如在北方灌溉棉区，每亩最高曾达到一千余斤籽棉，北方旱地棉区、南方两熟制棉区大面积的棉花产量，也曾达到平均每亩一百六十斤至一百八十斤籽棉的产量，都超过全国平均产量的一倍至十倍。但是，各地棉花单位产量是极不平衡的，许多灌溉棉区，由于灌溉技术不得法，增产潜力未能充分发挥，有的还不如旱地棉田产量高。新棉区技术较差，产量也都不高。因此，除了继续提高高产地区的产量外，对于产量低的棉区，粗绒棉区，很多的灌溉棉区，还必须加强植棉技术指导，提高其产量，只有这样才能作到全面增产。
    怎样改进植棉技术呢？各产棉区除应普遍推广已成功的先进经验外，应特别注意针对当地情况，发掘和推广当地切实可行的增产技术。在这方面，陕西省泾惠渠灌溉棉区是一个很好的例子。该区有灌溉棉田四十余万亩，近几年来连年减产，到了一九五二年，产量还不如旱地高，西北区及陕西省的农林、水利等有关部门，经过反复调查研究，并在苏联专家的指导下，针对这个棉区的特点，分析了历年减产的原因，拟订了技术改进方案，一方面交由当地农场继续试验研究，一面会同当地党、政机关、群众团体等领导农民稳步地进行技术改进。一九五三年采取了换茬、增施肥料、实行冬灌、提早春灌、进行沟灌、提早播种等措施。在一九五三年自然条件较好的情况下，已初步地有效地扭转了逐年减产的趋势，每亩平均产量比一九五二年提高了一倍。
    几年来的经验证明：在棉花播种前即把棉花增产的任务及价格政策向基层干部和群众讲清楚，作好棉花的收购和预购工作，作好棉种、肥料、药械等物资供应工作，并保证棉农的粮食供应，使棉农看到种棉的好处，就能够提高棉农的植棉情绪。特别是目前很多干部和群众对棉花增产还存在着一些误解时，作好这些工作，就显得更为重要。因此产棉区的党和政府的领导机关、花纱布公司、供销合作社等，必须在总结一九五三年棉产工作的基础上，针对当地情况，结合总路线总任务的宣传，切实作好以上工作。此外，各地产棉区的党和政府的领导机关还应发动群众积肥、整地、准备棉种，并针对不同棉区，提出不同的技术改进的重点，利用座谈会、训练班等形式，分别对基层干部及农民进行技术训练，作好技术上的准备。各地农业科学研究所、农事试验场，应把成功的植棉经验及时传授给群众。只有各方面完成以上的准备工作，一九五四年的棉花增产任务，才会有保证。
