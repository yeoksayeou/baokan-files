Old shepherd Feng Changfu drove the flock to a shady place for a midday rest, sitting himself down against a rock. The summer's midday sun shone brilliantly throughout the mountains and valleys, causing his old eyes to squint into slits. "Hum la, hum la, hum la..." He continuously made this sound from his mouth, his head and face slowly turning in all directions, as if talking to the sheep, but in reality, praising the bright and splendid mountain scenery. The mountain was the world he lived in. In his eyes, the mountain was not dead, but something with personality and emotion. Sometimes it was as quiet as a calm lake in the middle of the night, other times as angry as if it were going mad; sometimes it smiled like the morning glow, and other times it wore a gloomy face. With the changing of the time of day, and the changes in climate such as spring, summer, autumn, winter, wind, sunshine, rain, and snow, the mountain was constantly changing its expressions. Sometimes, Feng Changfu was perhaps tired of talking to his sheep, perhaps he had been made lazy by the summer sun, or softened by the gentle breeze of spring. His mind would think of nothing, his eyes would see nothing, only feeling that he had become one with the flock, like a light floating cloud. When he suddenly awoke, before his gaze could focus, he would feel that, under the intense glare of the sun, these mountains far and near were all transparent, as if made of glass. Sometimes, he would wake up in the middle of the night, and looking out from the cave, he would suddenly feel that the black shadows all around were not mountains, but large chunks of iron, so heavy, so frightening, as if the world had become a world of iron. Whenever this happened, he would make a "hum la, hum la" sound, his whole body unable to move for a long time.

Now he was in just such a state. He "hum la"-ed, not knowing how much time had passed, when he suddenly woke up again, his squinting eyes widening. He saw that two people were coming up the mountain from the foot of the distant mountain, like two white insects, trembling as they climbed upwards. Who could it be? Were they from the "cooperative" bringing grain? No, the grain had just been delivered yesterday....

The old man stood up and walked a few steps down the slope. The sheep immediately made sounds to each other, and all ran after his heels. He turned around and said "ohe" to them a couple of times, then turned back and looked down the mountain.

The two people had stopped halfway up the mountain, talking to another shepherd who was grazing sheep there -- Li Gen'er.

"Um, um, they're looking for that hairy kid..." he muttered, feeling a little disappointed.

In this desolate and frightening mountain, sometimes he so wished that someone would come to talk to him! But the two people were looking for Li Gen'er. What business could they have with that hairy kid, Li Gen'er? Could it be that something had happened in the kid's family? ...

He had no choice but to return to the rock where he had been sitting, feeling an indescribable sense of loneliness, so he closed his eyes, and before long, he dozed off.

Suddenly, he felt someone push his shoulders twice, and when he opened his eyes, there was a person standing in front of him: medium height, a sturdy farmer's face, wearing a sweat-soaked coarse white cloth jacket and trousers, with an old straw hat on his head, smiling and loudly saying to him:

"Old Uncle, are you asleep?"

"Who is this? I've never seen him before..." The old man muttered to himself, his eyes fixed on the small red notebook and black pen in the person's pocket, unable to figure out what kind of person he was, and not knowing how to respond. The wrinkles on his face moved, trying to put on a friendly smile, but he couldn't.

The person sat down on a rock opposite him, holding his knees with both hands, as if he was about to speak again. The old man suddenly noticed that the sheep had scattered, and he supported himself on the rock to stand up, but the person suddenly jumped up, took the whip from his hand, and like an "expert," quickly circled the flock, shouting "ah he" for a while. The three sheepdogs were also stimulated by his lively movements and became excited, jumping around the flock. The two hundred sheep, as if they had heard an order, quickly gathered together and clustered in the shade again. The person quickly came back, handed the whip to the old man, and sat down opposite him again, wiping the sweat from his face with a towel.

"Looks like you've herded sheep before?" The old man felt a little happy.

"Hehe, I herded sheep when I was a kid," the person said with a smile.

"How old were you when you herded sheep?"

"From thirteen to fifteen, a full two years."

"Um, I started at thirteen too, and it's been a full fifty years now."

"Old Uncle," the person suddenly moved closer, and said loudly, "I heard that you're an experienced shepherd, so I came specifically to ask for advice."

"Ask me for advice?" The old man really smiled this time.

"Old Uncle, do you know? In our seventh district alone, more than five hundred sheep died last winter and this spring, and more than eighty died in your Shuimen Village alone. That's a huge loss! I want to learn from you how to herd sheep well, and how to develop our pastoral industry here quickly."

"Are you a government person? From the district or the county?"

"From the district."

"Where did you come from today?"

"From the General's Tomb to your Shuimen Village..."

"That means you've walked dozens of li today! Just from Shuimen to here, it's a dozen li of mountain road that no one easily walks!" The old man's spirits lifted even more, his eyes, reddened by the mountain wind, widened even more, and his voice became even louder. "Um, you want me to talk about herding sheep? Alright! I don't know about other villages, but I know about our village. That one halfway up the mountain, you were just talking to him, right? That's Li Gen'er. After the snow fell last year, I took a look at his sheepfold and knew that those sheep were going to get sick, so I said to him: 'You're going to ruin those sheep. Just wait to eat mutton!' He didn't like to hear that at the time, shook his head, and left. Later, he secretly said to people: 'Feng Changfu is a blowhard. He can tell the sheep are going to get sick?' Guess what? In less than a month, more than thirty of his sheep died one after another. He felt sorry for the people in the agricultural cooperative and even cried! Only then did he admit his mistake and ask me how I could tell. Guess how I could tell? When it snows, at night, the sheep are cold in the fold, so they squeeze together. If you don't often drive them out to move around, after a long time, they'll get hot and damp, and their lungs and stomachs will get sick. When they get seriously ill, their fur will become shiny. I've been herding sheep for fifty years, don't I have that much experience? ... There are different ways to herd sheep in different seasons: in November and December, you have to graze on the shady slopes, and in February and August, you have to graze on the sunny slopes. In the spring, let the ewes eat the grass in front, and drive them to eat and walk quickly. This is called '舍羊不舍草' ('舍羊不舍草', giving up the sheep to save the grass), also known as '春走' (spring walking). One reason is to let the sheep move around to warm up and gain strength, and to reduce illnesses; the second is that the grass has just grown, so don't let them eat it all up at once. In the summer, drink plenty of water before going up the mountain. Once on the mountain, take advantage of the water, not the grass. When it is hot, the grass is lush, but if they eat their fill and don't drink enough water, they will get sick. However, when drinking water, they cannot drink against the current, because they might drink too quickly and easily get sick.... When a ewe is pregnant, give her salt once every half a month, prevent squeezing when entering the fold, go slowly when leaving the fold, be steady when going up the mountain, don't graze on icy grass, and don't drink rushing water..."

He saw that this comrade was writing in his notebook, so he spoke with even more enthusiasm, not even noticing that Wang Zhensheng, the secretary of the Shuimen Village branch, had already come up from the foot of the mountain, standing beside him, wiping the sweat from his neck, and tilting his head to look at him with a smile.

Wang Zhensheng coughed, interrupting his words, and loudly asked him:

"Uncle Changfu, you've spilled all your old secrets this time! But after talking for so long, do you know who this comrade is?"

"Who?" The old man squinted his eyes again, moved his body forward, and looked again and again at the comrade in front of him who was holding a notebook and smiling.

"This is District Chief Wang, and also the Deputy County Head of our county!"

"Oh! You're County Head Wang! It's so hot today, and you climbed this mountain so far to find me!"

The old man stood up abruptly, bent over, his face full of fishnet wrinkles, his beard almost touching District Chief Wang's face. Afraid that he couldn't see clearly, he walked around him once more:

"You're the one who told us the method that made our agricultural cooperative's wheat yield more than seven hundred and fifty jin per mu!"

District Chief Wang smiled, stood up as well, and took the old man's hand. Just as he was about to speak, the old man asked him again:

"Where did you learn this method? I've lived for more than sixty years, but I've never seen wheat yield three or four hundred jin. But you can make the wheat yield seven or eight hundred jin! I thought you were a god, but it turns out you're just an ordinary person..."

His hands were trembling, his beard was trembling, and his eyes were like he had drunk too much wine.

"Old Uncle," District Chief Wang put one hand on his shoulder, "Think about it, if the wheat in our entire district, entire county, entire province, and entire country can yield thousands of jin per mu, think about how great the production will be!"

"That would be great!" The old man paused, a little flustered by this sudden question.

District Chief Wang said again: "Old Uncle, think again, if all the sheep in our entire district, entire county... survive every lamb they bear, and the old sheep don't get sick, and we develop how many sheep in three, five, ten, or eight years!"

"Then, then, that number would be countless!"

"Think again, if the crops yield more, and the sheep also develop quickly, wouldn't the lives of our people improve?"

"Then, then, then, is that possible?" The old man looked intently at the District Chief's face again, speaking so softly, as if afraid of scaring himself.

The District Chief took his hand off his shoulder, pushed the straw hat on his head to the back, revealing his sweaty, steaming head, looked at the flock of sheep, and suddenly smiled softly, saying:

"Old Uncle, how many sheep did you have last winter?"

"One hundred and ninety-eight," the old man said, one word at a time.

"How many do you have now?"

"Two hundred and eighty-six."

"How did you get so many more?"

"Don't you know? Old sheep give birth to lambs..."

"None were wasted from last year to this year?"

"Not a single one."

"Old Uncle, then let me ask you, how did you do it?"

The old man was stunned, the toothless mouth in the gap of his beard opened into a black hole, and his red eyes widened. The District Chief's words had led him into a realm he had never experienced before.

"Ha!" He suddenly clapped his hands on his thighs and shouted.

After a while, he looked at the District Chief's face and asked softly:

"Can you teach everyone, everyone who herds sheep, to be like me?"

"Yes!" The District Chief said, taking a confident step forward, and taking the old man's trembling hand. "Old Uncle, do you know, you are a remarkable talent!"

The old man did not answer. The District Chief continued:

"Old Uncle, in a few days, the District Government will convene a district-wide sheep herders' conference, and they want to invite you to give a report, to talk about your experience in herding sheep. Later, they will also invite you to talk about your experience at the county-wide sheep herders' conference."

"Ha! Can an old useless thing like me attend a meeting with the County Head? Can I do great things?"

"Old Uncle, why not? If you tell all the sheep herders in the county about your experience, isn't that a big deal?"

The District Chief said something more, but the old man could no longer hear it clearly. He was suddenly confused, and just stared unblinkingly at Wang Zhensheng, as if trying to see from Wang Zhensheng's expression whether this was real. He saw that Lao Wang's mouth also moved for a long time, but he didn't hear a single word either.

The mountain turned into clouds and mist; the flock of sheep turned into clouds and mist; the two people in front of him walked down the mountain in the clouds and mist.

Tears filled the old man's eyes.

Ah! How is the world changing? ... From the age of thirteen, he began to herd sheep for the landlord. The landlord ate white flour, and I ate corn cakes. In the winter, the landlord baked coal fires in the house. I wanted to go to the kitchen to warm myself, but they said that I was a poor shepherd, and should stay in the sheepfold, and shouldn't enter the house or the courtyard, and they kicked me. In the summer, I didn't go down the mountain for three or four months at a time. I slept in the cave and was so afraid that I cried half the night. The landlord sent someone to bring me grain, and I cooked and ate it myself. Afraid of wolves and leopards, I often climbed trees to wait. When it rained heavily, I was afraid that the sheep would be washed away by the mountain water, so I drove them to the top of the mountain. Thunder boomed over my head, and the rain beat me so hard that I couldn't breathe.... Sigh, all year round, who would say a word to me, who would pay attention to me, who were my relatives? I had to be close to the sheep. I gave them names, called them Ghost Face, Strange Horns, Stick Legs, Fierce Look, and also "Old Woman," "Little Girl," "Young Man"... I called them, talked to them, scolded them, laughed at them, pitied them, and took care of them with all my heart.... Wasn't I a person? Didn't I want to talk to people and do things with people? ... I was liberated, and I was old, and useless... Down the mountain, that was the world of people. People sang, spoke, dust rose on the roads, and smoke came out of the chimneys. What a great world that was! What about me? I was on the mountain... But who knew? Who knew that I would be useful again, and would also show my face in the world of people! ...

The old man sat against the rock, thinking about the past and the future, forgetting everything. Suddenly, he thought of a very important thing that he had to find District Chief Wang about. He stood up abruptly and ran down the slope, shouting loudly:

"Li Gen—er! Li Gen—er!"

A loud echo resounded in the valley. The sheepdogs and the flock of sheep also ran with him frantically.

"Eh—!" Li Gen'er replied in a high voice from halfway up the mountain.

The old man ran to Li Gen'er's flock of sheep, and, panting heavily, said loudly to him:

"Tonight, help me watch the sheep for one night, I have to go down the mountain for a trip."

"What are you going to do?" Gen'er felt that the old man's expression was a little strange.

"I have something to do!"

"Did Wang Zhensheng ask you to go?" Gen'er asked again.

"Yes."

"He must be asking you to go and be criticized." Gen'er laughed as if he suddenly understood.

"Criticize me for what?"

Li Gen'er waved the whip in his hand, and said as if complaining:

"Didn't you see just now? As soon as I saw him, I gave him my opinion, saying that they had 'closed the mountains to cultivate forests' in the nearby mountains, and planted small trees, which prevented us from grazing sheep nearby. He said: 'Closing the mountains to cultivate forests is for building the mountainous areas. There are also mountains that are not closed nearby for grazing. In the summer, we ask you to graze in the distant mountains because the grass is better there, the sheep grow fatter, and it increases production for the agricultural cooperative.' That's how he criticized me. Don't you also have objections to closing the mountains to cultivate forests?..."

Before the old man could finish speaking, he put the sheep whip in his hand, glared at him, and asked:

"Do you agree to help me watch the sheep for one night?"

"Yes, that little thing still..." The young man was frightened by the old man's expression.

The two flocks of sheep had automatically merged into one flock, and the old man ran down the mountain as if flying.

He had walked this dozen li of mountain road for fifty years. His flock of sheep had left how much sheep dung on this winding and uneven cobblestone road. Usually, he was so familiar with every stone and every thorn along the road that seeing them was like not seeing them. But today, he felt that everything was fresh. The mountain peaks, the sunny places were so dazzling, and the shady places were floating with a thin layer of blue mist. The streams, the pebbles, you were making sounds under the old man's feet, were you singing or laughing? ...

The sky darkened, and the village was shrouded in a purple-gray haze of cooking smoke. The mutual aid groups and cooperatives were returning from the fields in twos and threes.

"You're back?" The old man greeted a young man walking at the head. "How many times have you watered the six mu of high-yielding corn in the cooperative?"

This young man's name was Wang Guanxi, and he had received agricultural technology training at the special commissioner's office. He was a technology committee member in the production cooperative. Before this, Feng Changfu did not often greet these young people. He felt that there was a wall between him and these young people, and that they neither understood each other nor could they talk to each other. Although he was also a member of the agricultural production cooperative, the cooperative recorded a day's work for him for every day he herded sheep, but he still had a bit of the old concept of master and servant in his heart. He sometimes didn't bother to attend the cooperative members' meeting. He always felt: "I'm living one day at a time, they can do with me or without me, I just herd my sheep, why bother with these things?"

Today, his attitude attracted people's attention, and they stopped to look at him, asking him:

"Why are you back today?"

"I'm back for a meeting. County Head Wang asked me to come." He wanted to say everything at once.

"What kind of meeting?"

"A district-wide meeting, asking me to talk about my experience in herding sheep..."

People felt that things had been clarified, and it was already very dark, so they "haha"ed a couple of times and walked into the village.

Feng Changfu also followed into the village. At the entrance of the village, he met two old women who had just finished grinding and were cleaning the grinding disc. He stopped again and asked them if they had seen County Head Wang, and also told them how the County Head had personally climbed the mountain to ask him for advice, and how he had invited him to attend the district-wide meeting.

Walking to the crossroads in the middle of the street, he chatted with several people who were holding bowls and eating dinner...

Finally, he felt a little hungry, so he groped to open the door of his two small rooms, took a handful of rice from the broken urn, scooped a ladle of water from the ditch in front of the door, stuffed a handful of firewood into the stove that had not been lit for a long time, and hastily cooked two bowls of porridge. While eating, he heard someone shouting for a meeting on the street, and his heart jumped. He quickly put down his bowl and chopsticks, walked out of the door, and groped in the darkness for a long time. Finally, he found the meeting place at the South End Elementary School.

He quietly squeezed into the room, which was full of sweat and smoke, sat down in a dark corner at the back, and listened to people talking.

At first, he was very restless, and he didn't hear what people were saying clearly. He only felt that they were talking about pear trees.

Suddenly, after a burst of applause, the meeting place became particularly quiet, and even people's breathing could be heard clearly. This attracted Feng Changfu's attention. He straightened his back and stretched his neck. He saw a young man standing next to the small oil lamp on the podium, with a dark red face, a short and stocky figure, as shy as a bride, bowing his head, sometimes laughing "hee", and sometimes coughing softly. After fidgeting for a full pipe of tobacco, he finally said a few words in a very, very low voice. Because his voice was so low, Feng Changfu focused his attention and heard every word clearly. These were the words: "Fellow villagers, I don't have anything good to say. Anyway, I'm a member of the Communist Youth League, serving the people..." After saying this, he blushed, quickly dodged to the side, and sat down. Then there was another round of applause, and a burst of shouting.

After people calmed down again, District Chief Wang's figure appeared next to the lamp. He wiped the sweat from his head with a towel and began to speak.

"Comrades, fellow villagers," his expression was very serious, and his voice was very low and slow. "He Zhi'an is usually an honest and shy young man. I understand him: when he was a child, people said he was a little simple, and his family also thought he wouldn't amount to much. But now, everyone look, is he simple? Is he stupid? Is he not promising? He received the education of the Party, and wholeheartedly wants to seek happiness for all the people in the village. He responded to the call from above to develop small-scale water conservancy, wanting to turn our hillside dry land into irrigated land, and invented a method of digging 'passing-water wells' [Note], which increased our irrigated land by forty mu... There are other examples in your village, such as Wang Luowen, who raises 'stud livestock'. In the past, people said that raising 'stud livestock', using 'stud livestock' to breed other people's livestock, was a shameful thing. But in the past two or three years, with the government's support, he has actively served the people, and has played a great role in improving the breeds of cattle and donkeys! How many people come to him to learn technology! There is also Uncle Qiu Wanger in your village... How big a role he plays in the production cooperative! And there is also the shepherd, Uncle Feng Changfu. He is a remarkable person..."

Hearing this, Old Man Feng's whole body shook, his ears were buzzing, and he couldn't hear clearly again. After he regained his composure, District Chief Wang's words were almost over:

"...The more society progresses, the more the working people can do great things, the more the lives of the working people will be like life, and the more they will look up to themselves..."

Old Man Feng Changfu didn't remember when he stood up, or how he followed the people who had dismissed the meeting to the outside of the meeting place, until a cool breeze blew on his head, and he regained consciousness, and realized that he was already standing at the gate of the schoolyard.

"County Head Wang!" He suddenly caught up and grabbed District Chief Wang's arm. "I came down the mountain specifically to find you..."

"Oh, it's Uncle Feng!" District Chief Wang grabbed his hand tightly and shook it. "You came down the mountain!"

"I came down the mountain specifically to find you," the old man repeated. "This is a big deal. Just like you said just now: you're asking me to do a big thing! I can't look down on myself! I should also make a good impression in my heart first! I can't find anyone to discuss with on the mountain, and when the meeting starts..."

"Are you talking about the sheep herders' representative conference?"

"Yes, I haven't spoken in front of so many people before. If I don't speak well, wouldn't there be a loss?"

"Old Uncle, your opinion is very correct. I'll stay at your house tonight, and we'll talk some more."

In the singing of the young people, in the murmuring of the river water in front of the door, the old man led the District Chief into his home.

That night, neither of them closed their eyes. They talked from the old society to the new society, from the present to the future.

Before dawn the next day, the old man set off in the dark to return to the mountain. He missed his flock of sheep even more, and he felt that although he was old, the path of life had become longer and wider.

[Note] A "passing-water well" is a well dug in relatively high ground. A horizontal tunnel is dug from the bottom of the well to a channel, so that the water in the channel flows into the well through the tunnel. A waterwheel or winch is installed on the well to irrigate the land.

    老羊工
    ——建设山区的人们之四
  　秦兆阳
    老羊工冯常福把羊群赶到蔽荫的地方歇晌，自己靠着岩石坐着。夏天正午的阳光在满山满谷里闪耀着，照得他的老花眼眯成了两道缝儿。“哼啦，哼啦，哼啦……”他嘴里不住地发出这种声音，头脸慢慢地向四面转动着，像是在跟羊群说话，实际上是在赞美这光辉灿烂的山景。山，是他生活着的世界。在他的眼睛里，山不是死的，而是有性格有感情的东西。它有时候安静得像半夜里风平浪静的湖水，有时候又愤怒得发狂；有时候像清晨朝霞一样地微笑，有时又板着阴沉的脸；随着时间的早晚，和气候上春夏秋冬风晴雨雪的变化，山是经常在变换着表情的。有时候，冯常福也许是跟他的羊儿们说话说累了，也许是被夏天的阳光晒懒了，或是被春天的柔风吹软了，脑子里什么也不想，眼睛什么也看不见，只觉得自己跟羊群混成了一体，像一团轻飘飘的浮云，等他猛然惊醒的时候，眼神还没有凝定的时候，就觉得，在强烈的阳光晃耀之下，这远远近近的山，竟全是透明的，像玻璃做的一样。有时，他在半夜里一觉醒来，从岩洞里往外一望，忽然觉得四下里的这些黑影子不是山，而是一大块一大块的铁，是那么沉重，那么怕人，好像这世界变成了铁的世界。每当在这样的时候，他就在嘴里发出一种“哼啦，哼啦”的声音，全身好半天好半天地不能动弹。
    现在他正是在这样的情形中。他“哼啦”着，也不知过了多长的时间，忽然又惊醒了，眯着的两眼睁大了，原来是那远远的山脚下边上来了两个人，像两只白色的小虫子，一颤一颤地在往上爬。是谁呢？“社”里送粮食来的吗？不会，昨天才送来了粮食呢……。
    老头子站起来了，往下坡走了几步。羊群里立刻响起了互相召唤的??声，都跟着他的脚后跟跑起来。他回身对着它们“哦嗬”了两声，又回过身来，向山下瞅去。
    那两人却停在半山腰里，跟在那里放羊的另一个羊工——李根儿在说话。
    “嗯嗯，是找那毛小子的……”他嘟哝着，心里有些失望。
    在这空寂得怕人的大山里边，有时候，他是多么希望有个人来跟他说说话儿啊！然而那两个人却是找李根儿的，找李根儿那毛小子有什么事儿呢？莫非是这小子家里发生了什么事情？……
    他只得又回到原来的岩石跟前坐下来，心里有一股说不出来的孤苦味道，就闭上了眼睛，不多一会，竟打起盹儿来了。
    忽然，他觉着肩膀上被人推了两下，睁眼一看，面前站着个人：中等个儿，一张庄稼人的挺浑厚的脸，穿着一身汗湿了的粗白布褂裤，头上戴着顶旧草帽儿，笑着大声对他说：
    “老大伯，睡着啦？”
     “这是谁？没见过呀……”老头子在心里叨咕着，两眼瞅着这人衣裳口袋里的小红皮本儿和黑杆钢笔，估不透他是个啥样的人，也不知道该怎么答对。他脸上的皱纹动了动，想装出一个和悦的笑模样，却没有装出来。
    那人在他对面的一块石头上坐下了，两手抱着膝盖，像是又要说话。老头子忽然发现羊群散开了，扶着岩石想站起来，不想那人猛地跳起身来，从他手里接过鞭子去，像个“行家”似的，飞快地绕着羊群“啊喝”了一阵，那三只看羊的猛狗也被他这活泼的动作刺激得兴奋起来，围着羊群蹦跳着；那二百多只羊就像听到了命令似的，赶紧往一块凑，又都集聚到阴凉地方来了。那人就飞快地走了回来，把鞭子交给老人，又在对面坐下了，用手巾擦着脸上的汗水。
      “看样儿你也放过羊？”老头子心里有些高兴了。
      “嘿嘿，小时候放过。”那人笑着说。
      “多大的时候放过？”
      “从十三岁放到十五，整两年。”
      “嗯哼，我也是从十三起始的，到如今整五十个年头儿啦。”
      “老大伯，”那人忽然往前挪了挪身子，大声说，“我听说你是个放羊的老经验，特地找你来讨教的呢。”
    “找我讨教？”老头子这回真的笑起来了。
      “老大伯，你知道吧？光咱们七区，去年冬天跟今年春天就死了五百多只羊，光你们水门村就死了八十多只，你看这损失是多大！我就是想来找你学学，怎么着才能把羊放好，怎么才能叫咱这一弯儿的牧畜业发展得快。”
      “你是政府的人吧？区里的还是县里的？”
      “是区里的。”
      “今日从哪来？”
       “从将军墓到的你们水门村……”
       “这么说，你今日可走了几十里啦！光从水门到这儿，就是十几里轻易没人走的上岭路！”老头子的精神更大了，被山风吹红了的眼睛也更睁大了，声音也更高了。“嗯，你想叫我说说放羊的事儿？好！别村的事儿咱不知道，咱村的事我可清楚。那半山腰里，刚才你还跟他说话来吧？就是那个李根儿。头年下雪以后，我到他那羊圈里瞅了瞅，就知道那些羊要坏，就对他说：‘你把羊弄坏了，等着吃羊肉吧！’当时他不爱听，把脑袋一摇，就走了，后来暗地里对人说：‘冯常福吹大炮，羊坏了他能看得出来？’你猜怎么着？过了不到一个月，他那羊，一连死了三十多只，他觉着对不起农业社（农业生产合作社）的人们，还哭了一场呢！他这才认了头，问我是怎么看出来的。你猜我是怎么看出来的？天一下雪，夜里，羊在圈里冷，就使劲往一块儿挤，要是不时常赶它们起来活动活动，时间长了，发热受潮，肺里胃里都受病，病重了，身上的毛就发亮。我放了五十年羊，还没这点经验？……放羊，一年四季有不同的放法：六腊月要放阴坡，二八月要放阳坡。春季让母羊在前吃草，要赶着它们一边吃一边快走，这叫‘舍羊不舍草’，又叫‘春走’，一来是叫羊们活动着发暖长劲，也少病痛；二来是，草儿刚长起来，别叫它们一下子吃绝了。夏季，上山以前多饮水，上了山，趁水不趁草，天挺热，草儿挺茂，吃饱了不多喝水，就得病。可是，饮水时不能逆着水流儿饮，怕的是喝得太急，也易得病……母羊怀了羔儿，要半月给它吃一次盐，进圈防挤，出圈要慢，上山要稳，不放冰凌草，不饮急流水………”
    他看见这同志一个劲的往小本上记，就越说越有劲，竟没有注意到水门村的支部书记王振生早已从山下边上来，站在他的旁边，一边擦着脖子上的汗，一边歪着头瞅着他笑。
    王振生咳嗽了一声，打断了他的话，大声问他：
    “常福大伯，这一下你可把你那老葫芦籽儿全掏出来啦！可说了半天，你知道这个同志是谁？”
    “谁？”老头子又眯起了眼，把身子往前挪了挪，朝自己面前这个拿着笔记本儿微笑着的同志瞅了又瞅。
    “这就是那王区长，又是咱县的副县长！”
    “哦！你就是那王县长呀！今日这么热，你爬这么远的山路来找我！”
    老头子霍地站了起来，弯着腰，满脸笑出了鱼网皱，胡子差点触着王区长的脸，还怕看不清楚，又围着他转了一圈：
      “就是你告诉的法儿呀，叫咱农业社的麦子一亩打了七百五十多斤呀！”
    王区长微笑着，也站了起来，拉着老头的手，正要说话，老头又问他：
    “你是从哪儿学来的法儿？我活了六十多年，可从来没见过麦子打过三四百斤的，你倒能叫麦子打七八百斤！我还以为你是个神仙呢，原来你也是个平常样儿……”
    他的手在发抖，胡子也在发抖，眼睛像喝醉了酒一样。
   “老大伯，”王区长用一只手搭在他的肩膀上，“你想想，要是咱全区全县全省全国的麦子，每亩都能收千数斤，你想，那出产是多大！”
    “那敢情好！”老头子顿了一下脚，被这突然的问话弄得有些慌张了。
    王区长又说：“老大伯你再想想看，要是咱全区全县……的羊，生一个羊羔儿就能活一个，老羊也不闹病，三年五年十年八年里边，咱要发展多少羊！”
      “那，那可就数不清数儿啦！”
      “你再想想看，庄稼打得多，羊儿也发展得快，咱老百姓的生活不就改善了吗？”
       “那，那，那办得到吗？”老头子又使劲瞅着区长的脸，说得那么轻，好像怕把自己吓住了似的。
      区长把手从他的肩膀上拿下来，把头上的草帽往背后一推，露出了汗气蒸腾的光头，瞅着羊群，忽然轻轻一笑，说：
      “老大伯，你放的这羊，头年冬天是多少只？”
       “一百九十八。”老头子一字一板地说。
       “这会儿有多少只？”
      “二百八十六。”
      “是怎么多起来的？”
      “那还不知道？老羊生小羊，……”
      “从去年到今年一只也没蹧蹋？”
       “一只也没有。”
      “老大伯，那我问问你，你是怎么办到的？”
    老头子愣住了，胡子缝儿里没牙的嘴张成了一个黑洞，那发红的眼睛也瞪圆了。区长的话把他引进了一个从来没有经验过的境界里去了。
      “哈！”他忽然两手拍着自己的大腿，叫起来了。
    停了一会，他又瞅住区长的脸，轻声问道：
      “你能叫一切一切放羊的人，都学我的样儿吗？”
       “能！”区长说着，用自信的步子往前走了一步，又拉住了老头发抖的手。“老大伯，你知道吗，你自己就是个了不得的能人呢！”
    老头没有回答。区长接着说：
       “老大伯，过几天区政府要召集一个全区的羊工代表大会，要请你去作报告，讲讲放羊的经验。以后，还要请你到全县的羊工代表大会上讲经验哩。”
      “哈！像我这么个老废物，还能跟县长一块儿开会？还能办大事？”
       “老大伯，咋不能呢？要是把你的经验告诉全县的羊工，那不是大事吗？”
    区长还说了些什么，老人却再也听不清楚了，他
  一下子糊涂了，只是不转眼地瞅着王振生，像是要从王振生的神情上看出这是不是真实的事情。他看见老王的嘴也动了半天，却同样地一句也没有听清。
    山，变成了云雾；羊群，变成了云雾；眼前的两个人，在云雾里往山下走去。
    老人眼里噙满了泪水。
    啊！世界是怎么在变化呢？……从十三岁起开始给财主放羊。财主吃白面，我吃糠饼子。冬天，财主在屋子里烤煤火，我想凑到厨屋里去暖暖身子，说我是个穷放羊的，该在羊圈里待着，不该进屋进院，用脚踢我。夏天，一连三四个月不下山，在岩洞里睡觉，胆小得一哭哭半夜；财主派人给我送粮食来，自个生一顿熟一顿的作了吃；怕狼怕豹，常爬到树上去待着；下暴雨，怕羊给山水冲走了，往山顶上赶，雷在头顶上轰，雨打得我透不过气来……唉唉，一年到头谁跟我说句话呀，谁理我呀，谁是我的亲人啦，我只好跟羊亲，我给它们起名儿，叫它们鬼脸儿、怪觭角、棍子腿儿、凶样儿，还有“老太婆”呀，“小姑娘”呀，“小伙子”呀……我叫它们，跟他们说话，骂它们，笑话它们，痛它们，尽心尽意地看顾他们，……我不是个人吗？我不想跟人在一块儿说人话作人事吗？……解放啦，我也老啦，不中用啦……山下边，那是人的世界，人们唱歌，说话，道儿上起尘，烟囱里冒烟，那是多好的世界呀！我呢？我在山上……可谁知道呢？谁知道我又有了用啦，也要到人们的世界里去露露脸啦！……
    老人靠着岩石坐着，思前想后，忘记了一切。忽然，他想起了一件很要紧的事情，必须要去找找王区长。就猛地站起身来，往下坡跑着，大声叫着：
       “李根——儿！李根——儿！”
    山谷里响起了洪亮的回声。看羊狗和羊群也跟着他拼命地奔跑起来。
      “呃——！”李根儿在半山腰里尖声回答着。
    老头子跑到李根儿的羊群跟前，喘着粗气大声对他说：
      “你今夜捎带着帮我看一宿羊，我要下山去一趟。”
      “你干啥去？”根儿觉着老人的神气有些奇怪。
       “我有事！”
     “是王振生叫你去吗？”根儿又问。
      “是。”
      “准是叫你去挨批评的。”根儿像忽然明白了似的，笑起来了。
      “批评我什么？”
    李根儿把手里的鞭子一晃，像诉委屈似地说道：
    “刚才你没见着吗？我一看见他就给他提意见，说他们把近处的山都‘封山育林’了，栽上小树了，害得我们不能在近处放羊。他说：‘封山育林，是为了建设山区。近处也有没有封的放羊山，夏天叫你们往远处放，是为了远处的草好，羊儿长的肥，为农业社增加生产。’就这么批评了我一顿。你不是对封山育林也有意见吗？……”
    老头子不等他说完，就把放羊的鞭子往他手里一搁，瞪着眼问他：
    “你答应不答应帮我看一宿？”
     “答应，这点事还……”小伙被老头的神气吓慌了。
    两群羊已经自动地合成了一群，老头就飞也似的往山下跑去了。
    这十几里山路他走了五十年，他的羊群在这曲折不平的小石头路上拉了多少羊屎；在平常，这沿路的每一块石头和每一棵荆棘，他都熟得看见了像没有看见一样。但是今天他却觉得到处新鲜。那山峰啊，向阳的地方是那么耀眼，背阳的地方又浮着一层薄薄的蓝色的雾。那溪流啊，碎石啊，你们在老人的脚下发响，是唱歌呢还是发笑？……
    天色暗下来了，村子笼罩在一片紫灰色的炊烟里，互助组和合作社的人们三三两两地从地里回来了。
    “你们回来啦？”老人跟一个走在头里的青年人打招呼。“社里那六亩丰产玉米浇了几水啦？”
    这青年名叫王官喜，曾在专署受过农业技术训练，在生产合作社里当技术委员。在这以前，冯常福是不大跟这些青年人打招呼的，他觉得他跟这些青年人之间像隔着一道墙，彼此既不了解，也谈不来。他虽然也是农业生产合作社里的一员，他放一天羊社里给他记一个劳动日的工，但他心里总有点旧的主雇之间的观念；社里召开社员大会时，他有时也懒得去参加。他总觉得：“我是活一天算一天，人家有我也可，没我也可，我只是放我的羊，管这些事情干吗？”
    今天他的态度却引起了人们的注意，都停住脚瞅着他，问他：
    “今日你咋的回来啦？”
    “回来开会哩，王县长叫我来的。”他愿意一下子把事情都说出来。
      “开什么会？”
    “全区的大会，叫我说说放羊的经验……”
    人们都觉得事情已经弄明白了，并且天色已经很黑了，就“呵哈”了两声，往村里走去了。
    冯常福也随着进了村。在村头碰见两个刚推完碾正在打扫碾盘的老太太，他又停下脚来，问她们看见王县长没有，又告诉说：刚才县长怎么亲自爬到大山上去向他讨教，又怎么请他去参加全区的大会。
    走到街当中的十字路口上，他又跟几个捧着碗吃晚饭的人扯谈起来……
    最后，他觉着肚子有点饿了，就摸着开了自家那两间小屋的门，从破瓮里摸出一把米来，从门前河沟里舀了一瓢水，往久未动烟火的灶里塞了一把柴禾，胡乱作熟了两碗粥，一边吃着，听见街上有人吆喝开会的声音，心就跳起来了，赶紧把碗筷一撂，走出门来，在黑影里摸了好半天，最后总算在南头小学里找到了会场。
    他悄悄地挤进那满是汗气和烟气的屋子里，在人后边一个黑角落里坐下来，听着人们说话。
    起先，他的心里很不安定，人们的发言他没有听清楚，只觉得是说的关于梨树的事情。
    忽然，在一阵掌声之后，会场里显得特别安静了，甚至连人们的呼吸声也听得清清楚楚了。这却引起了冯常福的注意，他挺直了腰，伸长了脖子，只见主席台的小油灯旁边站着一个青年人，黑红脸盘，墩墩个儿，像新娘子似的羞得低着头，有时
  “嘻”地一笑，有时又轻轻地“咳”着嗓子，足足扭捏了一袋烟的工夫，才用极低极低的声音说出几句话来。正因为他声音特别低，冯常福反倒集中了注意，每个字都听清楚了，是这样几句话：“乡亲们，我没有什么好说的，反正我是个团员，为人民服务……”一说完就红着脸赶紧往旁边一闪，坐了下来。接着又是一片掌声，一阵嚷叫。
    等人们又安静下来以后，灯亮旁边出现了王区长的身影，他用手巾擦了擦头上的汗，就说起话来了。
      “同志们，乡亲们，”他的神情很严肃，声音很低很慢。“何至安平常是个老老实实挺腼腆的青年，我了解他：小时候，人们都说他有点憨，他家里人也以为他不会有什么出息，可是，现在大伙儿看看，他憨吗？傻吗？没出息吗？他受了党的教育，一心一意想替全村的人们谋幸福，他响应上级开展小型水利的号召，想把咱们的山坡旱地变成水浇地，发明了打‘过水井’〔注〕的办法，使得咱们增加了四十亩水地……你们村里还有别的例子，比如养‘种牲口’的王洛文，过去人们都说养‘种牲口’，用‘种牲口’给别人家的牲口配种，是丢人的事，可是，这两三年，他在政府扶助下，积极为人民服务，在改良牛驴的品种上起了多大作用！有多少人来向他学习技术！还有你们村的邱万更老大伯……他在生产合作社里起多大作用！还有放羊的冯常福老大伯，他是个了不起的人……”
    听到这里，冯老头子全身一震，耳朵里嗡嗡直响，又听不清楚了。等他重新镇定了以后，王区长的话已经快要结束了：
    “……社会越进步，劳动人民就越能办出大事来，劳动人民的生活就越像生活，就越发看得起自己……”
    冯常福老头子不记得自己是什么时候站起来的，是怎么跟着散了会的人们走到会场外边来的，直到一阵凉风吹到他的头上，他才清醒过来，才发觉自己已经站在学校的院子门口了。
    “王县长！”他突然赶上一步，抓住了王区长的胳膊，“我是特地下山来找你的……”
       “哦，是冯老大伯呀！”王区长紧紧抓住他的手，摇着，“你下山来啦！”
     “我是特地下山来找你的，”老头子重复着说。“这是件大事呀，正像你刚才说的一样：你是叫我办大事呀！我不能看不起自己呀！我也该先在心里好好打个底儿呀！我在山上找不着人商量，到时候开起会来……”
     “你是说的羊工代表大会吗？”
       “是呀，我又没当着好多人说过话，到时候说不好，不是有损失吗？”
    “老大伯，你这个意见很对。今日我就上你家里宿吧，咱俩再说说话儿。”
    在青年人的歌唱声里，在门前河水的淙淙声里，老人领着区长进了自己的家。
    这一夜，他们两人都没合眼，他们从旧社会说到新社会，从现在说到将来。
    第二天天还没亮，老人就摸着黑动身回山，他更加惦念他的羊群了，他觉得自己虽然老了，生活的路子却反倒长远了宽阔了。
