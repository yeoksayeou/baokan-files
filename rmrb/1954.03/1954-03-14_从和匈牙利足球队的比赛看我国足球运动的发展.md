Looking at the Development of China's Football Movement from the Game with the Hungarian Football Team
Zhang Qihua

From February 14th to March 11th, the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team held eleven friendly matches and three exhibition matches with various Chinese football teams in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. These eleven friendly matches, on the one hand, showed that China's football movement has made significant progress in the past year. On the other hand, they also showed that the technical level of China's football movement is still far behind that of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team, which means that there is still a relatively large gap between the technical level of China's football movement and the world level. Therefore, actively developing football, improving football techniques in all aspects, and gradually but quickly reaching the world level is a major and glorious task before us in football.

Is it possible for China's football movement to reach the world level in a considerable period of time, just like other sports? It should be said that it is definitely possible.

We know that Hungarian football has a certain foundation. However, the reason why it has reached such a high level today and achieved world significance is due to the active advocacy of the Labor People's Party and the Republic Government after liberation, and the continuous learning of the Soviet Union's advanced sports experience. Although the foundation of China's football movement is not as good as Hungary's, because it has the care and promotion of the Party and the People's Government, and the Soviet Union's advanced sports experience to learn from, as well as the friendly and selfless help of various fraternal countries, as long as we can persevere in our efforts, undoubtedly, China's football movement can also reach the world level in a considerable period of time.

According to China's actual situation, to develop football and rapidly improve the technical level of football, we should first pay attention to:

First, making football an increasingly popular sport among the masses. One of the main factors for the high technical level of Hungarian football is that this sport has a broad mass base. In Hungary, there are mass sports organizations everywhere, and every factory has its own football team. Hungary has a population of more than nine million, with 120,000 registered football players, and another 500,000 young football players who participate in regional competitions but are not registered. This broad mass base continuously provides excellent football players, enabling Hungarian football to reach the highest level in the world. This time, the Hungarian People's Republic sent three national football mixed teams to China, the German Democratic Republic, and Egypt for friendly matches, which is enough to illustrate how strong the strength of Hungarian football, with its broad mass base, is. Since liberation, the number of people participating in football in China has not only increased significantly compared to the past, but the technical level of the sport has also been continuously improving. However, this is still a long way from our requirement to make football a sport loved by the masses, mobilize more people to participate in this sport, and rapidly improve the technical level of this sport, and we need to do more work.

Second, developing youth football. We have already paid attention to this issue. At the 1953 National Football Congress, a youth football exhibition match was held. But our youth football movement still needs to be further developed. Young people are in the period of growing up. Correctly developing football among them will, on the one hand, enable their bodies to receive more comprehensive exercise and more comprehensive development. At the same time, it can also expand the reserve force of football and continuously improve the technical level of football. Any football player who wants to reach a high level must undergo long-term, continuous, and scientific training, which must start from youth. Many of the outstanding players of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team who visited China this time emerged from youth football. The main players and outstanding players of the Hungarian football team, such as 苏查 (Sū chá), 孔尼亚 (Kǒng níyǎ), 包波尔查伊 (Bāobō'ěrcáyī), etc., loved and actively participated in football from their youth. Outstanding players 查尼 (Chání) and 汉尼 (Hànní) participated in the youth football mixed team ten or twenty times. This shows that an excellent football player must undergo long-term training.

In the process of developing mass football and youth football, we will encounter some difficulties. The first is the difficulty of lacking sufficient venues and coaches brought to us by the backward state of sports in old China. At present, our general factories, organs, and most secondary schools lack football fields. But this difficulty will be gradually resolved with the increasing development of China's economic construction and cultural construction. At present, we should try our best to use existing venues, improve their utilization rate, and use relatively spacious places to conduct basic football training. In this way, the problem of venues can still be properly resolved even at present. Regarding the issue of coaches, in terms of teaching materials, we have the Soviet Union's advanced training methods to learn from. This time, the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team's performance in China, as well as the reports and training course demonstrations by the football team leader 阿达姆·约瑟夫 (Ādám·Yuēsèfū), head coach 克莱邱维奇 (Kèlěiqiūwéiqí), and coach 狄特科士 (Dítèkēshì) to Chinese athletes and sports workers, are all good teaching materials for us to conduct football coaching in the future. In terms of coaching staff, although our current sports teachers cannot fully meet the requirements for more extensive development of sports, this problem will also be gradually resolved. This year, the national sports leading organs have listed the training of cadres as one of the important tasks. At present, since we have good football teaching materials, we can use them to strengthen the training of existing sports teachers in football, and we can also organize some short-term training classes for sports activists, or organize existing athletes with better football skills to serve as guidance for grassroots sports activities, according to the principle of consistency between needs and possibilities. These are also effective ways to solve the current shortage of coaching staff.

Third, according to the Soviet Union's advanced experience, combined with the experience learned from the Hungarian football team this time, we should strive to improve the technical level of our football movement in all aspects.

We must first strengthen the training of various basic football movements and improve their level. For example, the issue of controlling the ball. Controlling the ball is the most basic movement in football. If you are not good at controlling the ball, then you will not be able to dribble, pass the ball flexibly and accurately in the game, you will not be able to organize offense and defense, and you will not be able to win. In the friendly matches between China's football teams and the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team, we saw that the biggest difference between the two sides, that is, the disparity in strength, was first of all the ability to control the ball. The Hungarian National Football Mixed Team players' skills in controlling the ball are extremely outstanding. Whether it is from their eleven friendly matches in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, or from the documentary film "Six to Three" about the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team's victory over the British National Professional Football Team Mixed Team, it can be clearly seen that the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team players have extremely excellent ball control techniques. In the course of the game, regardless of the direction, strength, and height of the ball, they can use their head, chest, legs, and feet to control the ball obediently under their feet. They dribble the ball back and forth in the opponent's territory, dodge the opponent's players, and pass the ball, often controlling the ball under the feet of their own players without error. They can also, at the moment of stopping the ball, pass the ball accurately to a teammate who is more conducive to attacking the goal without letting the ball come to a complete stop. Such excellent ball control skills are the result of their long-term arduous training. Since we have actually seen and initially learned the essentials of these movements through their training demonstrations, then, as long as we work hard to understand and study them, we will be able to gradually reach their level.

We must also strive to learn the advanced offensive and defensive methods of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team. In the past, we have learned the "seven attacks and eight defenses, three defenders" system of offensive and defensive methods in football, but from these few games this time, it can be clearly seen that this is not enough. The comprehensive offense and comprehensive defense method used by the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team shows that the entire team is completely formed into a flexible fighting whole in the game, and all eleven players have assumed their own active tasks in offense and defense. In the attack, their five forwards have a strong ability to charge and fight. Their midfielders not only play an assisting role, but are also often active attackers. Their defenders often press to or cross the midline to assist in the attack in the offensive, and can even attack to the opponent's hinterland to seize the opportunity to attack the goal when the situation requires. Their goalkeeper, when passing the ball, is in fact also responsible for the task of attacking. After the goalkeeper receives the opponent's incoming ball, quickly and accurately passing the ball is often the beginning of the team's offensive. In defense, their goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards all play an active role. Their goalkeeper, defenders, and midfielders have very strong defensive capabilities. It is worth pointing out that their forwards often engage in fierce competition in the opponent's penalty area, establishing their deepest defensive line. Their forwards often retreat to their own team's territory to defend in the defensive, especially the left and right wings can also retreat to the appropriate position where they can receive the goalkeeper's pass, on the one hand, to strengthen the defensive power, and on the other hand, to prepare for the attack. To use such a comprehensive and holistic offensive and defensive method, players need to have strong physical strength and flexible and intelligent minds, and this requirement is precisely what our football players must strive to achieve.

In addition to the basic action of controlling the ball and the comprehensive offensive and defensive methods, the Hungarian football team players' fast dribbling, accurate passing, clever changes of position, agile shooting skills, and the team's bravery and intelligence are also advantages that we should strive to learn.

Finally, we should cherish this visit to China by the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team for friendly matches and the enthusiasm for football it has aroused among the masses, and guide this enthusiasm of the masses, especially the youth, into the practice of developing football and other sports. The eleven friendly matches and three exhibition matches held by the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places, in addition to nearly 300,000 spectators directly visiting (due to venue limitations, many people could not enter the venue to visit), more football enthusiasts listened to the live radio broadcasts of the matches. During the game, people were very concerned about the situation of the game and talked about the details of the game. The visit of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team to China has aroused the enthusiasm of the masses for football, which is of great significance for further developing China's football movement, improving sports technology, and gradually enabling China's football movement to reach the world's advanced level.

    从和匈牙利足球队的比赛看我国足球运动的发展
    张其华
    匈牙利国家足球混合队和我国各足球队，自二月十四日至三月十一日在北京、上海、武汉等地举行了十一场友谊比赛和三场表演比赛。这十一场友谊比赛，一方面说明了我国的足球运动近一年来又有显著的进步；另一方面也说明了我国足球运动的技术水平和匈牙利国家足球混合队比较起来还相差很远，也就是说，我国的足球运动的技术水平和世界水平之间还有一段比较大的距离。因此，积极开展足球运动，从各方面提高足球运动技术，逐步而又迅速地达到世界水平，这是在足球运动方面摆在我们面前的一项重大的光荣的任务。
    我国的足球运动是否能够和其它各项体育运动一样，在一个相当时期内达到世界水平呢？应当说，一定能够的。
    我们知道，匈牙利的足球运动是有一定的基础的；但是，它所以能够达到今天这样高度的水平，获得世界意义的成就，却是在解放以后，这是由于劳动人民党和共和国政府的积极倡导，和不断学习苏联先进体育运动经验的结果。我国足球运动的基础虽然不如匈牙利，但是因为有着党和人民政府的关怀和提倡，有着苏联的先进体育运动经验足资学习，同时还有各兄弟国家的友好无私的帮助，只要我们能够坚持不懈地努力，无疑的，我国的足球运动也能够在一个相当时期内达到世界水平。
    根据我国的实际情况，开展足球运动，迅速提高足球运动的技术水平，首先应当注意：
    第一，使足球运动日益成为广大群众所喜爱的一项体育运动。匈牙利足球运动之所以能够达到高度的技术水平，它的一个主要因素就是这项运动具有广泛的群众基础。在匈牙利，到处都有群众性的体育组织，每一个工厂都有自己的足球队。匈牙利国家有九百多万人口，注册的足球队员就有十二万，另有五十万只参加各地区比赛而未经注册的青年足球队员。这样广泛的群众基础，源源不断地提供着优秀的足球运动员，使匈牙利的足球运动达到了世界最高水平。这次，匈牙利人民共和国同时派出了三个国家足球混合队到我国、德意志民主共和国和埃及进行友谊比赛，这更足以说明，具有广泛群众基础的匈牙利足球运动的实力是多么雄厚。我国自解放以来，不仅参加足球运动的人数已比以前显著增加，而且运动技术水平也在不断提高。然而，这和我们要使足球运动成为广大群众所喜爱的一项体育运动、动员更多的人参加这项运动，迅速提高这项运动的技术水平的要求，还有很大的距离，还需要我们做更多的工作。
    第二，开展青年足球运动。现在，我们已经注意了这个问题。在一九五三年全国足球运动大会上，即已举行了青年足球的表演比赛。但我们的青年足球运动还很需要进一步开展。青年正处在长身体的时期，在他们中间正确地开展足球运动，一方面将会使他们的身体得到比较全面的锻炼、比较全面的发展；同时，还可以扩充足球运动的后备军，不断提高足球运动的技术水平。任何一个足球运动员要想达到高度的水平，必须经过长期的、经常不断的、科学的锻炼，这就必须从青年时期开始。这次来我国访问的匈牙利国家足球混合队的优秀队员，许多都是从青年足球运动中涌现出来的。匈牙利足球队的主力、优秀队员苏查、孔尼亚、包波尔查伊等，都是从青年时期就热爱和积极参加足球运动的。优秀队员查尼和汉尼则十次、二十次地参加过青年足球的混合队。这就说明，一个优秀的足球运动员，必须经过长期的锻炼。
    在开展群众性的足球运动和青年足球运动的过程中，我们将会遇到一些困难，这首先是旧中国体育落后的状况所带给我们的缺乏足够场地和教练的困难。目前我们的一般工厂、机关以及大多数中等学校，都缺乏足球运动场。但这个困难将会随着我国经济建设、文化建设的日益发展逐步获得解决。目前我们应当尽量利用现有的场地，提高它的使用率，并利用比较宽敞的地方，进行足球运动的基本训练。这样，关于场地问题即使在目前也还是可以适当解决的。关于教练问题，在教材方面，我们有着苏联的先进锻炼方法足资学习。这次匈牙利国家足球混合队在我国的表演，以及足球队领队阿达姆·约瑟夫、总教练克莱邱维奇和教练狄特科士向中国运动员和体育工作者的报告和训练课示范，都是我们今后进行足球运动教练的良好教材。在教练人员方面，虽然我们目前的体育师资还不能完全满足更广泛地开展体育运动的要求，但这个问题，也将会逐步获得解决。今年，国家的体育运动领导机关，已将训练干部问题列为重要任务之一。目前，我们既然有了良好的足球运动的教材，就可以用它来加强现有体育师资的关于足球运动的培养训练工作，并且，还可以根据需要和可能相一致的原则，举办一些短期的体育积极分子训练班，或组织现有的足球运动技术修养较好的运动员，来担任基层体育活动的指导工作，这些也都是目前解决教练人员不足的问题的有效办法。
    第三，根据苏联的先进经验，结合此次从匈牙利足球队所学得的经验，努力从各方面提高我们足球运动的技术水平。
    我们首先必须加强足球运动的各种基本动作的锻炼，并提高它的水平。例如控制球的问题。控制球是足球运动的最基本的动作，如果不善于控制球，那末，在比赛中也就无法灵活而准确地运球、传球，也就无从组织进攻和防守，也就无法取得胜利。在我国各足球队和匈牙利国家足球混合队的友谊比赛中，我们看到双方最大的区别，也就是实力悬殊的所在，首先就是控制球的能力。匈牙利国家足球混合队队员们控制球的技巧是极为卓越的。无论从他们在北京、在上海、在武汉的十一场友谊比赛中，或是从匈牙利国家足球混合队战胜英国全国职业足球队混合队的纪录影片“六比三”中，都可以清楚地看到匈牙利国家足球混合队队员们的极为卓越的控制球的技术。他们在比赛进行中，不论来球的方向、力量、高度，都能够使用他们的头、胸、腿、脚，将球服贴地控制在自己的脚下。他们带球在对方阵地内来往驰骋、闪避对方球员和进行传递，经常将球控制在自己队员脚下而无失误。他们还能够当停球的一刹那间，不使球完全停止即行将球准确地传递给本队更有利于攻门的队员。这样卓越的控制球的技术是他们长期坚苦锻炼的结果。我们既已实际看到并通过他们的训练示范初步学到了这些动作的要领，那末，只要我们努力体会钻研，也就完全能够逐步达到他们的水平。
    我们还必须努力学习匈牙利国家足球混合队的先进的攻守方法。我们过去在足球运动上已经学习了“七攻八守、三后卫”制的攻守方法，但从这次的几场比赛中，明确地可以看出，这是不够的。匈牙利国家足球混合队所运用的全面进攻、全面防守的方法，显示出比赛中全队完全形成为一个灵活的战斗整体，十一个队员在进攻和防御上都担当了自己的积极的任务。在进攻中，他们的五个前锋冲锋陷阵的能力是强大的。他们的前卫不仅起着助攻作用，而且经常都是积极的进攻者。他们的后卫，在攻势中经常压至或越过中线助攻，在形势需要时甚至也能攻到对方腹地伺机攻门。他们的守门员在传球的时候，事实上也担当了进攻的任务。在守门员接获对方来球以后，迅速准确地传球，常是本队攻势的开始。在防守上，他们的守门员、后卫、前卫和前锋都起着积极作用。他们的守门员、后卫、前卫的防御能力是很强的。值得指出的是，他们的前锋常在对方的罚球区域进行剧烈的争夺，建立他们的纵深最远的防守线。他们的前锋在守势中经常退至本队阵地进行防御，尤其是两翼的左锋、右锋也能退至能够接得守门员传球的适当位置，一面增强防御力量，一面准备进攻。运用这样的全面的整体的攻守方法，就需要队员具有强健的体力和灵活机智的头脑，这种要求正是我们的足球运动员所必须争取达到的。
    除了控制球的基本动作和全面的攻守方法以外，匈牙利足球队队员们的快速运球、准确的传递、巧妙的变换位置、敏捷的射门技术和全队的勇敢、机智的优点也都是我们应当努力学习的。
    最后，我们应当珍视这次匈牙利国家足球混合队来我国进行访问比赛和它在广大群众中所激起的对足球运动爱好的热情，并把广大群众，尤其是青年群众的这种热情引导到开展足球运动和其它体育运动的实践中去。匈牙利国家足球混合队在北京、上海、武汉等地进行的十一场友谊比赛和三场表演比赛，除了有近三十万观众直接参观以外（由于场地的限制，许多人不能入场参观），有更多的足球运动爱好者收听了比赛实况的无线电广播。在比赛期间，人们都非常关心比赛的情况，纷纷谈论着比赛中的细节。匈牙利国家足球混合队来我国，引起了广大群众对足球运动的爱好，这对进一步开展我国的足球运动，提高运动技术，以逐步使我国的足球运动达到世界先进水平是有重大意义的。
