    Respects to the Brave and Lovable People's Liberation Army
    Produce More Grain to Support the People's Liberation Army
    Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:
    On behalf of all members of our agricultural production cooperative, I extend to you our highest respect and sincere greetings. I would also like to report to you on our production situation and our work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families:
    After the completion of the land reform, we responded to Chairman Mao's call to "get organized" and actively carried out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1952, we established an agricultural production cooperative, and production greatly increased. The yield per unit area was half as high as that of the surrounding individual farmers, and the personal income of the cooperative members was half to one times more than that of the surrounding individual farmers. As a result, many individual farmers asked to join the cooperative. This year, our cooperative has grown from the original 24 households to 100 households, with 152 hectares of land and 150 million yuan of public property. In order to support the country's industrial construction, we sold more than 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state last year. Recently, our entire cooperative has formulated this year's agricultural production plan, which calls for the production of 1.14 million jin of grain, and plans to sell 620,000 jin of surplus grain, 15,000 jin of pork, 20,000 eggs, and 10 head of cattle to the state. We will also repair fish ponds, plant fruit trees, and build 59 new houses. We are creating conditions for gradually moving towards advanced agricultural production cooperatives.
      Dear comrades! We all know that the reason why our production can continue to increase and our lives can be so good is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and from your hard work day and night to protect the country's national defense and economic construction. Therefore, your families are also respected and loved by the people of the whole country. There are 17 military families in our cooperative. Thanks to the assistance of the People's Government and their own active labor, they are now living a life above the level of middle peasants. For example, Zhang Kuishan, a military family member, earned 7.75 million yuan last year and built two new brick houses after the autumn harvest. Yu Yongxing, a military family member, was honorably elected as the deputy village chief in last year's general election, and was also elected as the production team leader in the cooperative. Our cooperative contracted to cultivate the paddy fields of Jin Yushun, a military family member. Last year, each hectare of rice produced 25 shi, which was 3 shi more than the average yield of the entire cooperative. Because we have done a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, we have received a silk banner awarded by the county.
    Recently, after we studied the general line of the country during the transition period, everyone was even more encouraged to run the production cooperative well, continuously improve technology, increase production, and transition to socialism together with the people of the whole country. I believe that you will always maintain revolutionary vigilance, defend the security of the motherland and the peace of the Far East and the world, so that the motherland can move smoothly on the road of building socialism. In addition, we must learn from your spirit of hard struggle and guarantee to continue to support you with practical actions to do a good job in agricultural production and support the army and give preferential treatment to military families.

    Guarantee to do a good job in substitute farming Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:
    In our agricultural production cooperative, from gray-haired old people to children who have just come to their senses, we all deeply realize that our happy life is the result of your decades of hard struggle, and it is what you have exchanged with blood and sweat. Today, because you are defending the national defense of the motherland, we can carry out production steadily. Dear comrades! You are the most lovable people to us. Your spirit of hard struggle is a model for us to learn from, and it encourages us to fight against all natural disasters. In August last year, we suffered from drought and insect pests. The members were not frightened by the disaster. They said: "Our soldiers can defeat the Japanese devils and eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries; can't we eliminate these few hairy insects and overcome the drought!" Through everyone's efforts, we finally overcame the natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest, which increased by 15% compared with 1952.
    We are also always concerned about you and your families. The members all regard substitute farming as their own business and a very glorious job. Last year, our cooperative cultivated more than 60 mu of land for four households of revolutionary martyrs and military families, which all increased production compared with previous years, so that the lives of the revolutionary martyrs and military families were improved. Our cooperative was also rated as a model for substitute farming and was rewarded by the People's Government.
    After all the members of our cooperative studied the general line, everyone's understanding has been improved, and we are determined to run the cooperative well and actively develop agricultural production to support the country's economic construction. In addition to selling more than 67,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, we have also absorbed many new members. At present, our cooperative has grown from 59 households to 98 households, and the land has also increased from 718 mu to more than 1,100 mu. Our cooperative plans to produce more than 550,000 jin of grain this year, reclaim 30 mu of wasteland, plant 1,500 apple trees, raise 500 chickens, and carry out other sideline production. Now we are actively carrying out spring plowing work, striving to over fulfill this year's production increase plan. We have also decided to continue to do a good job in substitute farming so that the lives of the revolutionary martyrs and military families can be better. I hope that you will continue to improve your vigilance, strengthen your military, political and cultural studies, master modern military science, and defend the national defense of the motherland, so that the motherland will become a copper wall and iron wall of peace fortress.

      Brought us a good time Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:
    We are all members of the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. After hearing the news that the people of the whole country sent a delegation to visit you, everyone felt happy from the bottom of their hearts. The peaceful and happy life we are living now is inseparable from your decades of hard struggle and heroic sacrifice, and it is what you have exchanged with blood. "Don't forget the well-digger when you drink water," we have never forgotten you.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, we implemented land reform and actively carried out the mutual aid and cooperation and patriotic bumper harvest movement in response to Chairman Mao's call. In February 1953, we formed an agricultural production cooperative; Czechoslovak friends also sent our society 16 new-style agricultural tools such as tractors, water pumps, and horse-drawn plows. Therefore, our production has greatly increased. Last year, the yield of corn per mu was 301 jin, an increase of 73.9% compared with the yield four years ago. After studying the general line, the members' awareness has been further improved, and they are determined to run the cooperative well. Many farmers outside the cooperative have also asked to join the cooperative. Therefore, our production cooperative has expanded from the original 34 households to more than 380 households, with nearly 6,000 mu of land. At present, we are actively preparing for spring plowing production, striving to produce more grain this year. Last year, we sold more than 35,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and this year we will sell more grain to the state.
    Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army: In addition to striving to develop agricultural production, striving to produce more grain to support national economic construction and support you, we must also strive to do a good job in preferential treatment to ensure that the revolutionary martyrs and military families live the best life.

    向英勇可爱的解放军致敬
    打更多的粮食来支援解放军
    亲爱的人民解放军同志们：
    我代表我们农业生产合作社全体社员，向你们致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问，同时并把我们的生产情形和拥军优属工作向你们报告一下：
    土地改革完成以后，我们就响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，积极开展互助合作运动。一九五二年我们成立了农业生产合作社，生产大大提高，单位面积产量就比周围个体农民高一半；社员们个人收入也比周围单干农民多半倍到一倍。因此，许多单干农民纷纷要求参加合作社。今年我们的合作社已由原来的二十四户发展到一百户，社内有一百五十二垧土地，还有一亿五千万元的公共财产。为了支援国家的工业建设，去年我们把十万多斤余粮卖给国家。最近我们全社又制定了今年农业生产计划，要求生产出一百一十四万斤粮食，并计划卖给国家六十二万斤余粮、一万五千斤猪肉、二万个鸡蛋、十条菜牛；还要修养鱼池，栽果树，再盖五十九间新房子。我们正在为逐步地向高级农业生产合作社迈进而创造条件。
      亲爱的同志们！我们大伙儿都知道，我们的生产所以能不断提高、日子所以能过得这样好，是和共产党和毛主席的正确领导，和你们千辛万苦、白天黑夜保卫着祖国的国防和经济建设分不开的。因此，你们的家属也受到了全国人民的尊敬和爱戴。我们全社共有十七户军属。由于人民政府的扶助和他们自己的积极劳动，现在他们都过着中农以上水平的生活。像军属张奎山去年收入七百七十五万元，秋收后还盖了两间新砖房。军属于永兴在去年普选时光荣地当选为副村长，在社内又被选为生产队长。我们合作社包耕军属金玉顺的水田地，去年每垧水稻产了二十五石，比全社平均产量还多三石。由于我们拥军优属工作做得好，曾得到县里奖励的一面锦旗。
    最近我们学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线以后，大伙儿更鼓足劲头来办好生产合作社，不断改进技术、提高产量，和全国人民一道过渡到社会主义。相信你们一定会经常保持着革命警惕性，保卫祖国的安全和远东与世界的和平，使祖国能够在建设社会主义的道路上顺利前进。另外，我们还要学习你们艰苦奋斗的精神，保证用搞好农业生产和做好拥军优属工作的实际行动来继续支援你们。

    保证做好代耕工作亲爱的人民解放军同志们：
    我们农业生产合作社中，从白发老人到刚懂事的小孩都深深体会到：咱们的幸福生活是你们几十年来艰苦奋斗的结果，是你们用血和汗换来的。今天，由于你们保卫着祖国的国防，咱们才能安稳地进行生产。亲爱的同志们！你们是咱们最可爱的人。你们这种艰苦奋斗的精神是咱们学习的榜样，并鼓励着咱们向一切自然灾害进行斗争。去年八月间，咱们这里发生了旱灾和虫灾，社员们没有被灾情吓住。他们说：“咱的子弟兵，能打败日本鬼子和消灭国民党反动派；难道咱们就不能消灭这几个毛虫子和战胜旱灾吗！”经过大家的努力，咱们终于战胜了自然灾害，取得了丰收，比一九五二年增产了百分之十五。
    咱们也时时刻刻关心着你们，关心着你们的家属。社员们都把代耕工作看成是自己分内的事和顶光荣的工作。去年俺社为四户烈属、军属代耕，六十多亩地都比往年提高了产量，使烈属、军属们的生活改善了。俺社也被评为代耕模范，受到人民政府的奖励。
    咱们全体社员学习了总路线后，大伙的认识都提高了，决心办好合作社，积极发展农业生产来支援国家经济建设。咱们除把六万七千多斤余粮卖给国家外，并吸收了很多新社员。目前俺社已由五十九户发展到九十八户，土地也由七百十八亩增加到一千一百多亩。俺社今年计划产五十五万多斤粮食，开荒三十亩，种植苹果等树一千五百棵，养鸡五百只，还要进行其他副业生产。现在咱们正在积极进行春耕工作，争取超额完成今年增产计划。我们并决定继续认真做好代耕工作，使烈属、军属的生活过得更好。希望你们不断提高警惕，加强军事、政治和文化的学习，掌握现代化的军事科学，保卫祖国国防，使祖国成为一个铜墙铁壁的和平堡垒。　农业劳动模范　吕鸿宾
      给我们带来了好光景亲爱的人民解放军同志们：
    我们是北京市郊区张郭庄农业生产合作社的全体社员。听到全国人民派代表团慰问你们的消息后，大伙儿打心里感到高兴。我们现在过的和平安乐日子，是与你们几十年来的艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲分不开的，是你们用鲜血换来的。“吃水不忘掏井人”，我们时刻没有忘记你们。
    解放后，我们在人民政府领导下实行了土地改革，响应毛主席的号召积极开展互助合作和爱国丰产运动。一九五三年二月，我们组成了农业生产合作社；捷克斯洛伐克朋友又送给我社拖拉机、抽水机、马拉步犁等十六件新式农具。因此，我们的生产大大提高了，去年的玉米每亩产量是三百零一斤，比四年前的产量增加了百分之七十三点九。经过总路线的学习后，社员的觉悟进一步提高了，下决心要把合作社办好。许多社外农民也纷纷要求加入合作社。因此，我们的生产合作社就由原来的三十四户扩大到三百八十多户，有了近六千亩的土地。目前我们正在积极准备春耕生产，争取今年打更多的粮食。去年我们卖给国家三万五千多斤余粮，今年我们要把更多的粮食卖给国家。
    亲爱的人民解放军同志们：我们除了要努力发展农业生产，争取多打粮食来支援国家经济建设和支援你们以外，还要努力做好优抚工作，保证烈属、军属的日子过得顶好。
