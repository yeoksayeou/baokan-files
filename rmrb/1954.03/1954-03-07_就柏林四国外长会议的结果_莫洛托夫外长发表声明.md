Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov issued the following statement:

The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Berlin from January 25 to February 18. This meeting discussed several important international issues.

The last Four Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in the spring of 1949. No such meeting has been held in the past five years. The Berlin Conference unanimously concluded that another meeting must be held with the participation of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. This has positive international significance.

(I)

The development trend of the capitalist camp in the post-war period has been vividly demonstrated in the past five years. It is now clear to everyone that the ruling groups in the United States are striving to play the leading role in this camp, and they are greedy for more than that. They shamelessly say that they shoulder the "burden of leading the world," and that the United States is the "leader of the world." However, these assertions are unfounded.

This attempt is specifically manifested in the establishment of the North Atlantic Group in 1949 under the initiation of the U.S. government and with the active support of the British ruling group. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed with the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,  Denmark , Norway , Iceland , Portugal ,  Italy,  Greece , and  TÃ¼rkiye . Some of these countries signed the treaty because they were under direct external pressure. This treaty is actually a tool of the U.S.-British bloc, that is, the United States wants to use this treaty to establish its world hegemony. The North Atlantic Treaty is similar to the well-known "Anti-Comintern Pact." The "Anti-Comintern Pact" was signed by Hitler's Germany, militarist Japan, and fascist Italy in 1937, and its spearhead was initially directed against the Soviet Union. There is no reason to doubt that the fate of the North Atlantic Treaty will not be better than the fate of the "Anti-Comintern Pact."

While openly pursuing world hegemony, the ruling groups in the United States, as well as the ruling groups in the United Kingdom, have begun to increasingly emphasize that they want to implement a "strength" foreign policy. This is not unexpected. From the attempt to dominate the world to the policy of "strength" or the policy of "peace based on strength," there is only one step.

It is not only the United States and the United Kingdom that are advocating this policy, but also other countries in the North Atlantic Group, and we all know the consequences.

The direct manifestation of this policy is the recent expansion of armaments. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Norway, and other countries in this group have expanded their armaments to an unprecedented scale. This expansion of armaments has made the monopoly capitalists of the United States and Europe rich. But the people and working people of these countries have been burdened with heavy taxes and have suffered from high prices.

Atomic bomb intimidation is particularly valued. However, this will not last long either. Now everyone sees that the calculation based on the illusion of the United States' monopoly on atomic bombs has proven to be completely bankrupt.

While expanding armaments, the United States and the United Kingdom are building large-scale military bases in Europe and its affiliated territories. The construction of these military bases is openly aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, which shows that the construction of American military bases has nothing in common with defense.

Along with the "strength" policy came the Paris Treaty signed two years ago to establish the so-called "European Defense Community." This treaty stipulates the restoration of West Germany's armed forces. Now some people are planning to revive German militarism, while not long ago, not only France and other European countries, but even the United States and the United Kingdom opposed the resurgence of German militarism. This has created new and extremely serious difficulties in the solution of the German question.

Many other actions of the United States in international affairs also embody the "strength" policy.

For example, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as other countries in this camp, have jointly implemented various discriminatory measures regarding international trade against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies in recent years. Although this policy has caused huge damage to the United States and the United Kingdom, they still continue to obstruct normal international trade by various excuses, adopt various methods, and exert pressure, and limit and create difficulties in establishing economic relations with various countries in the democratic camp. However, this policy has had the opposite effect. In recent years, the economic ties between the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies have been greatly strengthened, and the economies of these countries have been rising year by year.

Now everyone sees that the "strength" policy implemented by the U.S.-British ruling groups has not produced good results, whether in the political or economic fields. This policy has also suffered a disastrous defeat in the military field.

This policy first failed the test in Korea. It did not enable the United States to achieve military victory. After the United States carried out military intervention in Korea, it lost its military prestige and moral authority. In a country where the people are waging a tenacious struggle for their national rights, independence, and freedom, this policy cannot but end in failure.

Despite the various assistance provided by the United States to France in Indochina, the "strength" policy has not yielded any good results there either. There, France's colonial policy, as well as the U.S. policy of supporting "colonialism," has suffered one failure after another. The protracted war against the people fighting for freedom in Indochina has not only failed to add glory to the "strength" policy, but has also discredited this policy.

In addition, it must be added that it was precisely in the past five years that the People's Republic of China, which freed the Chinese people from the violent rule of foreign imperialism, was not only established, but also consolidated. This fact has fundamentally changed the situation in the entire Asia. This fact has an extremely important role in the further development of the entire international relations.

It is precisely towards China that the "strength" policy has been adopted with particular obstinacy and extreme absurdity, both in the past and now. However, it is precisely here that the failure of this policy is particularly convincing.

In recent years, the socialist and people's democratic camp has developed and strengthened in many ways. During these years, the second world market has been formed. This market includes highly industrialized countries and agricultural-industrial countries within the democratic camp. The political relations between these countries are developing along the road of increasingly close cooperation and growing friendship.

What does the "strength" policy pursued by the U.S. ruling groups and the countries of the U.S.-British bloc mean? In the final analysis, this policy is nothing more than a foreign and domestic policy for preparing for a new war. There is nothing else. This policy will not receive the firm support of the people.

The Soviet Union's foreign policy is different from that of the United States. Its purpose is to consolidate peace and international cooperation. The Soviet policy starts from the basic position that no international dispute cannot be resolved peacefully. This is a policy of consolidating peace. This policy is in line with the interests of friendly cooperation between countries and helps to unite the peace-loving forces of the world.

Until recently, the above-mentioned foreign policy guidelines of the U.S.-British also influenced, to a certain extent, most of the countries in the capitalist camp. The implementation of the "strength" policy can only inevitably intensify international tensions. This affects Europe, and it also affects Asia, and it has affected and is affecting every corner of the world.

The Korean War was able to stop last year due to the initiative of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, thereby bringing about an important change in the international situation.

The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has helped to ease international tensions. This made it possible for the Soviet Union to raise the issue of further easing international tensions. The holding of the Berlin Conference itself proves that this possibility exists under the current conditions. Before the Berlin Conference, the Soviet government and the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France exchanged notes several times. The exchange of notes had its role. This improved the conditions for holding the Berlin Conference.

The Western three governments advocated that the Berlin Conference be limited to discussing some issues related to the German question and the Austrian peace treaty. They tried to avoid discussing other issues and the general issue of easing international tensions.

The Soviet government believes that after the cessation of the Korean War and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, favorable conditions have been created to start discussing the issue of adopting measures to promote a general easing of international tensions, including the issue of arms reduction and the issue of prohibiting the establishment of foreign military bases in other countries' territories.

The Soviet government suggested holding a five-nation foreign ministers conference with France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to discuss measures to ease international tensions, and suggested holding a four-nation foreign ministers conference to discuss the German question, including the restoration of German unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

In the exchange of notes before the end of last year, a complete agreement could not be reached, because the United States, the United Kingdom, and France opposed holding the above-mentioned five-nation conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Soviet government stated that it would raise this issue at the Berlin Four-Power Representatives Conference of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. An agreement was reached in this regard.

We put forward the following agenda at the Berlin Conference:

1.  Measures to ease international tensions and to convene a conference of foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China;
2.  The German question and the task of ensuring European security;
3.  The question of the Austrian peace treaty.

Although with some reservations, the conference accepted this agenda.

We must not forget how the Western countries prepared public opinion before the Berlin Conference. The basic guidelines of the U.S.-British foreign policy I mentioned above are also reflected in this preparatory work.

Until the last moment, the ruling groups in the United States and the United Kingdom were doing everything possible to put pressure on the Soviet Union. Not only the newspapers of these groups, but even government officials repeatedly said that it was useless to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and that the Berlin Conference was doomed to failure. Although the reactionary newspapers adopted various means of exerting pressure, even threatening to directly sabotage the conference, they still could not hide the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had interests in the Berlin Conference.

The governments of these countries had to take into account the increasing pressure from people from the democratic society, who demanded that the four-nation representatives' conference consider the aspirations of the people of all countries for easing international tensions. The upsurge of the national liberation movement of the people in various places, especially in Asia, also had the same impact.

It has been proven that France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have considerable interests in convening the Berlin Conference.

Before talking about some agreements reached at the Berlin Conference, it is necessary to first talk about the differences between the Soviet position and the position of the Western three countries as expressed at the conference.

(II)

The conference paid the most attention to the German question. As everyone knows, this is the main problem that has not been solved after the war. The four countries that sent representatives to the Berlin Conference have a special responsibility for the correct solution of this problem. That is to say, the solution of the German question should take into account the interests of guaranteeing peace and European security, and should conform to the national interests of democratic Germany.

The discussion process fully demonstrated the essence of the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. However, this does not mean that France's attitude towards the German question is completely consistent with the attitude of the ruling groups of the United States and the United Kingdom towards this question.

The Soviet Union has always believed that the task of guaranteeing peace and European security is first of all closely related to preventing the revival of German militarism.

Therefore, measures to restore German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis should not be delayed. This position is fully in line with the agreements signed by the anti-Hitler allied countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union) during the war and immediately after the war, and France later agreed to these agreements as well.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have abandoned this position, torn up the most important international agreements they once signed, and are engaged in the revival of German militarism. Since it is currently not possible to do this in the whole of Germany, they are vigorously preparing to remilitarize West Germany, and in this regard they rely on the Adenauer government in Bonn.

If the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, like the Soviet government, agreed not to allow the revival of German militarism, then the solution of other disputed issues would be much easier.

This also means that the four governments should rely not on German militarists and revanchists in this matter, but on the democratic, peace-loving forces in Germany that express the true wishes of the German people.

The Berlin Conference proved that the German question was also affected by the U.S.-British diplomatic policy, which was expressed as a "strength" policy or a "peace based on strength" policy.

Facts such as the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty signed in May 1952 prove this. These two treaties make the danger of German militarism revival imminent.

According to the Paris Treaty, a so-called "European Defense Community" is to be established for a period of fifty years, and under the banner of this community, an "European Army" is to be composed of the armed forces of six countries, namely France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. It can be seen from this that among about thirty European countries, six European countries including West Germany actually attempt to establish a narrow, exclusive military group, and although four-fifths of the countries do not participate in this group, they illegally hang a "European" sign. This treaty legitimizes the reconstruction of the West German army (Bundeswehr) and West Germany's participation in the above-mentioned military group. Initially, it was planned to establish twelve West German divisions, but now there are plans to further increase the strength of this army, and now some people are talking about establishing twenty-five or even sixty West German divisions, which is not accidental. When it comes to this, one cannot ignore the fact that recently the West German parliament (Bundestag) violated the current constitution and passed a resolution stipulating that all West German men over the age of eighteen should be conscripted into the army. This allows the Adenauer government to build up its army without restraint.

In addition to the Paris Treaty signed by the six countries, a Bonn Treaty was also signed at that time. This treaty was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. The Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are complementary.

According to the Bonn Treaty, the armies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will be stationed in West Germany for decades, turning West Germany into a semi-occupied country. The Adenauer government, which is the main pillar of those West German revanchists who are trying to clear the way for the revival of German militarism today, also signed this treaty. West German revanchists today advocate signing the Bonn Treaty, which insults the German people. However, there is no doubt that when the West German army under the command of Hitler's generals is established according to the Paris Treaty, the West German revanchists will disregard their signatures. At that time, their true purpose will be exposed, and their aggressive revanchist plans will be exposed, and the first to bear the brunt will be Germany's neighbors.

At the same time as the signing of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France announced a declaration aimed at vigorously supporting and accelerating the establishment of the "European Defense Community," that is, the establishment of the "European Army."

All of this reveals the far-reaching plans of the ruling groups of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and the signing of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty was precisely to implement these plans. Although the United States and the United Kingdom do not intend to add their armies to the "European Army," they are trying to become the actual masters of the "European Army." The conspiracy to establish a "European Army" including the West German militarist army can only have one explanation, and that is to plot a new war in Europe. And it is obvious that the U.S. ruling groups are trying to use the hands of the "Europeans" to carry out this new war.

After the establishment of the "European Army," since the French army will join the "European Army," then France will be the only one of the five major countries that may not have its own army. There is no doubt that the West German army will dominate the "European Army." In this way, France has seriously undermined the fundamental basis of the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in 1944 to prevent the resurgence of German militarist aggression. Some French ministers are willing to accept all this, but it is puzzling how this position can be reconciled with France's national dignity and interests.

As everyone knows, the parliaments of France, Belgium, and Italy have not yet ratified the Paris Treaty, so the Paris Treaty has not yet come into effect. However, recently the pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom on these countries, especially France, has been increasing, demanding that they ratify this treaty and put it into effect.

At the Berlin Conference, not only Dulles and Eden, but even French Foreign Minister Bidault, collected various excuses to defend the Paris Treaty and the establishment of the "European Defense Community." They even said that these treaties signed with West Germany are not formally binding on the future unified Germany. If German militarists and revanchists are truly able to use the possibility of restoring West German militarism provided by the Paris Treaty, then they will bring out these statements by the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

However, it is clear today that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the Adenauer government, are in fact eliminating the possibility of unifying West Germany and East Germany into a unified Germany. According to the Paris Treaty, they say bluntly that if this treaty is not extended to the unified whole Germany, then they will not let the two parts of Germany unite, that is, they will not allow the establishment of a unified and independent Germany. All of these vividly illustrates how little importance they attach to all their other suggestions regarding the German question.

One can think that the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France attending the Berlin Conference were not interested in truly solving the German question, or even solving any practical problem that is of great significance to the German people. Their attention was focused on one goal: to pave the way for the establishment of the "European Army" according to the Paris Treaty, which opens the door for the revival of West German militarism.

At the Berlin Conference, even the Soviet Union's suggestion to listen to the opinions of the Germans and understand how the German people themselves think about the urgent task of unifying Germany and the German people's participation in ensuring peace and European security was not adopted. The West German government also disagrees with this. Everyone can see that this government is unwilling to meet with the East German government, that is, the government of the German Democratic Republic, which opposes the plan to revive German militarism, at a table. However, in the current situation, it is precisely the German Democratic Republic that expresses the true wishes of all peace-loving German people, and expresses the true wishes of the German people to seek peace and to maintain friendly relations with all countries. The refusal to listen to the opinions of the German representatives shows how the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France do not want to seriously discuss the German question.

The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France refused to discuss the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, nor did they put forward their own draft peace treaty with Germany. They even refused to study how to accelerate the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany, although a four-nation foreign ministers conference had already begun to study this issue in detail several years ago.

The Western three foreign ministers refused to discuss the issue of forming a temporary all-German government composed of representatives of the East and West German parliaments, although this is a practical step to restore German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. They also refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to establish two all-German committees: one all-German committee is responsible for improving economic and administrative relations between East and West Germany, and the other all-German committee is responsible for improving the conditions for developing German national culture. They refused to take any practical steps to bring East Germany and West Germany closer together, although this is the most reliable way to restore German unity. The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France did not consider the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the financial and economic obligations borne by East and West Germany due to the consequences of the war. They certainly know that in East Germany, this measure has been implemented, for example, occupation fees have been reduced to no more than 4.5 percent of East Germany's national budget revenue. In West Germany, taxes are increasing and occupation fees are also increasing. This year's occupation fees account for almost 35 percent of West Germany's total national budget revenue.

The suggestions of the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the German question can be simply summarized as one thing - holding so-called "free elections" in East and West Germany. However, even this suggestion has nothing in common with solving the German question in accordance with the needs of guaranteeing peace and European security, and holding truly free elections. And this suggestion is full of distrust of the German people and their democratic forces.

Even such a purely domestic German affair is not allowed to be carried out by the Germans, but must be handed over to the occupying authorities. The Soviet Union suggested that the four countries assist the Germans in forming a temporary all-German government composed of representatives of the East and West German parliaments and various democratic groups, and then this government itself will hold free all-German elections. This suggestion of the Soviet Union was also not adopted.

Another suggestion we made was also not adopted. That is, before the all-German elections, all occupying forces should be withdrawn from East and West Germany, leaving only troops whose numbers are strictly limited. The purpose of this Soviet suggestion is to prevent the occupying authorities from exerting pressure on the elections. However, those who advocate so-called "free elections" rejected this suggestion, which is most in line with the needs of truly free elections.

Dulles is now also giving speeches on the Berlin Conference. He pretends to be an ardent supporter of the people's "freedom," a supporter of "free elections." But we know that not all words about "freedom" are in defense of the true freedom of the people, the working people. What some "defenders" of freedom like is a kind of "freedom" under which exploiters and militarists can do whatever they want, they can live in luxury, while the working people are under the constant threat of war and new massacres. Of course, we do not approve of this "freedom." We approve of true freedom. Under this freedom, militarists cannot drag the people into new bloody wars.

As everyone knows, in the past, in 1932-1933, Hitler and his party came to power through so-called "free elections." Hitler did not quickly become the German Chancellor. At first, it was people like Adenauer at that time who cleared the way for him, such as the famous Papen, who belonged to the same political party as the current Bonn Chancellor Adenauer. Everyone remembers very well that it was the German monopoly capital giants who made a fortune by expanding military industries who supported Hitler and his assistants like Papen at that time.

Now it is also those German monopoly capital giants who support the Adenauer group, which dreams of accelerating the rearmament of West Germany. They pin their hopes on new expansions of armaments to obtain new high profits and super-profits, and they connect their interests first of all with the plan to revive German militarism.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France verbally advocate free elections, but in fact they refuse to have any contact with the democratic and peaceful forces of the German people. What they intend is: the kind of freedom that they hope to give to Germany is best guaranteed by the occupying authorities relying on the occupying forces. Such distrust of Germany's democratic and peaceful forces not only cannot help Germany to further develop on a democratic and peaceful basis, but is also directly supporting those German militarists and revanchists, who have already used this support in West Germany to achieve their goals.

The current German policy of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France is completely subordinate to the plan to establish the "European Defense Community," that is, the "European Army," which leads to the revival of West German militarism. This approach cannot consolidate peace in Europe. Moreover, under this approach, since West Germany is no longer a peaceful country, and since it has become impossible to unify Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, then the road to restoring German unity has also been cut off.

The Soviet Union favors another policy, another approach, on the German question.

This has been demonstrated in the Soviet Union's proposals on the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty, on the unification of Germany, on the establishment of a temporary all-German government, and on holding free all-German elections. The purpose of these proposals is to do everything possible to accelerate Germany's national unity, while ensuring that Germany can further develop on a democratic and peaceful basis. It is quite clear that the Soviet Union's proposals can prevent Germany from becoming a dangerous source of aggression in Europe again. The starting point of these proposals is to prevent the revival of German militarism.

It can be seen that the solution of the German question currently depends on a fundamental question: whether to allow German militarism to revive, or not to allow German militarism to revive. It must be pointed out that within countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and even West Germany, in addition to government groups, they are doing their best to oppose the policy of establishing a European army and reviving West German militarism.

For example, in France, the growing opposition to this policy comes not only from workers and other strata of the working people, but also from bourgeois groups. This resistance in the French Parliament is intensifying. It is no accident that the British people are widely dissatisfied with this policy, and that almost half of the Labor Party MPs oppose this policy, which is maintained by the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party. It is understandable that in West Germany, the Social Democrats, taking into account the mood of the masses, continue to oppose the Adenauer policy, which advocates accelerating the revival of German militarism at the expense of restoring German unity. The policy of reviving German militarism has caused reasonable panic in various European countries.

There is every reason to raise a question about this policy: Which way is things developing? Towards consolidating peace, or towards a new war? What does the current approach of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to the German question lead to?

This approach leads to the establishment of military groups in some European countries to oppose other European countries. To go this way is to give up consolidating peace and European security. To go this way is to prepare for another war in Europe, and the result is leading to the Third World War.

Do France, Italy, Belgium, and other European countries and their comrades really have to go this way for the sake of security? Is it really necessary to establish a "European Defense Community" and at the same time remilitarize Germany in order to guarantee their security and European peace?

Recently, especially in France, people have asked more than once whether there is something to replace the "European Defense Community?" That is to say, what can replace this notorious "group"? If a "European Army" based on the revival of West German militarism is not established, can peace and European security be guaranteed? Although these questions have been raised more than once, the purpose of doing so is usually only to indirectly justify the plans stipulated in the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty.

At the Berlin Conference, the Soviet Union put forward a concrete plan in response to the plan to establish military groups in some European countries. According to this plan, guaranteeing peace and the security of European countries would have a solid foundation. This plan is the Soviet Union's draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security."

The "All-European Treaty" makes corresponding guarantees to prevent aggression and prevent damage to European peace. All countries in Europe, regardless of their social system, can participate in this treaty. Before Germany is restored to unity, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can also participate in this treaty, and after Germany is restored to unity, the unified Germany will participate in this treaty.

This treaty stipulates that if any contracting party is subjected to armed aggression, the other contracting parties shall provide assistance to that country in every possible way, including the use of armed forces, to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe.

At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal stipulates that the situation in Germany should be greatly improved at present, and that the occupying forces of various countries should be withdrawn from the entire territory of Germany, leaving only troops whose numbers are strictly limited.

The purpose of the Soviet Union's proposal is to establish an effective European collective security system to replace military groups composed of some European countries that are opposed to each other.

Since 1947, there has been a regional Pan-American Mutual Assistance Treaty, in which the United States and all countries in Latin America participate. Such a regional treaty has its positive significance if it is only for defensive purposes. Of course, attempts by the U.S. ruling groups to use this treaty to obtain selfish interests under the pretext of resisting communism cannot be considered legitimate. The Soviet delegation refuted the objections to the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security," pointing out that these direct objections to the regional European treaty were untenable. Such a treaty with a truly defensive nature is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

At the Berlin Conference, it was mentioned more than once that the current world is divided and that there are countries with different social systems. Naturally, this fact must be taken into account, and it must be taken into account that not only the Soviet Union, but also many countries have embarked on the road of socialism and people's democracy, and are advancing victoriously along this road.

We consider this to be the greatest achievement of the 20th century. We are not prepared to deny the fact that the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism now unites several countries with a population of 800 million. The growth of the strength of this democratic camp is obvious, and indeed in many ways it is truly worthy of learning from.

However, we have always consistently adhered to Lenin's principle that countries with different social systems can coexist.

We believe that, for example, in Europe, despite the existence of various different social systems, the people of all European countries are concerned about guaranteeing and consolidating peace. We hope that on the issue of defending peace, there will be no division into two camps, whether in Europe or throughout the world. We call on all European countries to refuse to establish military groups that are opposed to each other, because the establishment of such groups cannot but lead to war. We suggest that a single camp be formed by European countries that are willing to guarantee their security and consolidate European peace.

In this European security system, no country, even a powerful country, should be in a dominant position. The sovereignty of all countries participating in this collective security system must be guaranteed and protected from external infringement. The draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" is based on the above principles.

This draft was not supported by the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But no foreign minister was able to reject the idea of ââEuropean collective security. The people understand this idea. This idea has won the sympathy of all peace-loving people.

The idea of ââan All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security will continue to penetrate the hearts of millions of people and will most reliably promote the cause of peace and security in Europe and the world. The Soviet Union advocates that German troops should not be allowed to be established before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded, that is, Germany should remain neutral during this period.

Naturally, some ministers may continue to formulate various plans to establish the "European Defense Community" and to remilitarize West Germany. However, this will not achieve anything other than producing an unreliable military group that is not supported by the people. Another situation is the idea of ââEuropean collective security, which is embodied in the All-European Treaty, or it may be other forms. The people of European countries are increasingly sympathetic to this idea, because this idea expresses their heartfelt desire to consolidate peace and establish universal security.

The Soviet government has never concealed its opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty, which demonstrates the intention of the U.S.-British bloc to dominate the world. The attempt to establish the "European Defense Community," thereby directly promoting the revival of German militarism, has deepened the existing differences in many ways. The Soviet government opposes these differences being deepened. We are committed to resolving disputes in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace. In this particular case, it is particularly evident that the Soviet Union expressed the feelings and thoughts of all peace-loving people in Europe (and not just Europe).

The discussion on the German question at the Berlin Conference proved that the differences between the Soviet Union and the Western three countries primarily exist on the issue of German militarism, because there are now plans to revive German militarism. Since the Soviet Union once shouldered the main burden in the struggle against Hitler's aggression, it cannot but give sufficient estimates to the new aggressive dangers that will arise once German militarism revives.

The growing threat of West Germany's re-militarization cannot but have an impact on the Austrian question.

At the Berlin Conference, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France expressed their willingness to withdraw their objections to some of the clauses in the draft Austrian peace treaty, which they had been opposing for the past five years. This is enough to show how unfounded their past objections were.

The Soviet side had stated at the Berlin Conference that if the two suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union, which had become necessary due to the signing of the Paris Treaty to establish the "European Defense Community," were adopted, it would be prepared to immediately sign the Austrian peace treaty.

These two suggestions are:

First, we suggest that Austria should guarantee not to participate in any military group aimed at opposing any country that had sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria. Austria must also not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory;

Second, we advocate that a clause should be included in the Austrian peace treaty: In view of the delay in the signing of the peace treaty with Germany, the four foreign troops currently stationed in Austria can continue to stay there, and the issue of the time limit for the withdrawal of the four countries' troops from Austrian territory should be re-examined no later than 1955. If there is no plan to establish a "European Army," this additional clause would certainly not be necessary. This additional clause is necessary because the United States and the United Kingdom are now exerting various pressures to get France and other countries to agree to the revival of West German militarism, which naturally deepens the danger of a new Anschluss between Germany and Austria.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France did not agree to the Soviet Union's two supplementary suggestions on the Austrian peace treaty. They also prevented the Austrian government from treating these suggestions with due understanding. As a result, the Austrian peace treaty could not be signed.

The above-mentioned facts prove that the responsibility for the failure to sign the Austrian peace treaty should be attributed to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, who are unwilling to abandon the plan to revive German militarism, and their unwillingness to abandon this plan has deepened the danger of a new Anschluss between Germany and Austria.
