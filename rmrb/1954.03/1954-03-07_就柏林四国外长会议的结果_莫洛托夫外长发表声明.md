Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov issued the following statement:

The Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Berlin from January 25 to February 18. This meeting discussed several important international issues.

The last Four Foreign Ministers' Conference was held in the spring of 1949. No such meeting has been held in the past five years. The Berlin Conference unanimously concluded that another meeting must be held with the participation of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. This has positive international significance.

(I)

The development trend of the capitalist camp in the post-war period has been vividly demonstrated in the past five years. It is now clear to everyone that the ruling groups in the United States are striving to play the leading role in this camp, and they are greedy for more than that. They shamelessly say that they shoulder the "burden of leading the world," and that the United States is the "leader of the world." However, these assertions are unfounded.

This attempt is specifically manifested in the establishment of the North Atlantic Group in 1949 under the initiation of the U.S. government and with the active support of the British ruling group. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed with the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,  Denmark , Norway , Iceland , Portugal ,  Italy,  Greece , and  Türkiye . Some of these countries signed the treaty because they were under direct external pressure. This treaty is actually a tool of the U.S.-British bloc, that is, the United States wants to use this treaty to establish its world hegemony. The North Atlantic Treaty is similar to the well-known "Anti-Comintern Pact." The "Anti-Comintern Pact" was signed by Hitler's Germany, militarist Japan, and fascist Italy in 1937, and its spearhead was initially directed against the Soviet Union. There is no reason to doubt that the fate of the North Atlantic Treaty will not be better than the fate of the "Anti-Comintern Pact."

While openly pursuing world hegemony, the ruling groups in the United States, as well as the ruling groups in the United Kingdom, have begun to increasingly emphasize that they want to implement a "strength" foreign policy. This is not unexpected. From the attempt to dominate the world to the policy of "strength" or the policy of "peace based on strength," there is only one step.

It is not only the United States and the United Kingdom that are advocating this policy, but also other countries in the North Atlantic Group, and we all know the consequences.

The direct manifestation of this policy is the recent expansion of armaments. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Norway, and other countries in this group have expanded their armaments to an unprecedented scale. This expansion of armaments has made the monopoly capitalists of the United States and Europe rich. But the people and working people of these countries have been burdened with heavy taxes and have suffered from high prices.

Atomic bomb intimidation is particularly valued. However, this will not last long either. Now everyone sees that the calculation based on the illusion of the United States' monopoly on atomic bombs has proven to be completely bankrupt.

While expanding armaments, the United States and the United Kingdom are building large-scale military bases in Europe and its affiliated territories. The construction of these military bases is openly aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, which shows that the construction of American military bases has nothing in common with defense.

Along with the "strength" policy came the Paris Treaty signed two years ago to establish the so-called "European Defense Community." This treaty stipulates the restoration of West Germany's armed forces. Now some people are planning to revive German militarism, while not long ago, not only France and other European countries, but even the United States and the United Kingdom opposed the resurgence of German militarism. This has created new and extremely serious difficulties in the solution of the German question.

Many other actions of the United States in international affairs also embody the "strength" policy.

For example, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as other countries in this camp, have jointly implemented various discriminatory measures regarding international trade against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies in recent years. Although this policy has caused huge damage to the United States and the United Kingdom, they still continue to obstruct normal international trade by various excuses, adopt various methods, and exert pressure, and limit and create difficulties in establishing economic relations with various countries in the democratic camp. However, this policy has had the opposite effect. In recent years, the economic ties between the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies have been greatly strengthened, and the economies of these countries have been rising year by year.

Now everyone sees that the "strength" policy implemented by the U.S.-British ruling groups has not produced good results, whether in the political or economic fields. This policy has also suffered a disastrous defeat in the military field.

This policy first failed the test in Korea. It did not enable the United States to achieve military victory. After the United States carried out military intervention in Korea, it lost its military prestige and moral authority. In a country where the people are waging a tenacious struggle for their national rights, independence, and freedom, this policy cannot but end in failure.

Despite the various assistance provided by the United States to France in Indochina, the "strength" policy has not yielded any good results there either. There, France's colonial policy, as well as the U.S. policy of supporting "colonialism," has suffered one failure after another. The protracted war against the people fighting for freedom in Indochina has not only failed to add glory to the "strength" policy, but has also discredited this policy.

In addition, it must be added that it was precisely in the past five years that the People's Republic of China, which freed the Chinese people from the violent rule of foreign imperialism, was not only established, but also consolidated. This fact has fundamentally changed the situation in the entire Asia. This fact has an extremely important role in the further development of the entire international relations.

It is precisely towards China that the "strength" policy has been adopted with particular obstinacy and extreme absurdity, both in the past and now. However, it is precisely here that the failure of this policy is particularly convincing.

In recent years, the socialist and people's democratic camp has developed and strengthened in many ways. During these years, the second world market has been formed. This market includes highly industrialized countries and agricultural-industrial countries within the democratic camp. The political relations between these countries are developing along the road of increasingly close cooperation and growing friendship.

What does the "strength" policy pursued by the U.S. ruling groups and the countries of the U.S.-British bloc mean? In the final analysis, this policy is nothing more than a foreign and domestic policy for preparing for a new war. There is nothing else. This policy will not receive the firm support of the people.

The Soviet Union's foreign policy is different from that of the United States. Its purpose is to consolidate peace and international cooperation. The Soviet policy starts from the basic position that no international dispute cannot be resolved peacefully. This is a policy of consolidating peace. This policy is in line with the interests of friendly cooperation between countries and helps to unite the peace-loving forces of the world.

Until recently, the above-mentioned foreign policy guidelines of the U.S.-British also influenced, to a certain extent, most of the countries in the capitalist camp. The implementation of the "strength" policy can only inevitably intensify international tensions. This affects Europe, and it also affects Asia, and it has affected and is affecting every corner of the world.

The Korean War was able to stop last year due to the initiative of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, thereby bringing about an important change in the international situation.

The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement has helped to ease international tensions. This made it possible for the Soviet Union to raise the issue of further easing international tensions. The holding of the Berlin Conference itself proves that this possibility exists under the current conditions. Before the Berlin Conference, the Soviet government and the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France exchanged notes several times. The exchange of notes had its role. This improved the conditions for holding the Berlin Conference.

The Western three governments advocated that the Berlin Conference be limited to discussing some issues related to the German question and the Austrian peace treaty. They tried to avoid discussing other issues and the general issue of easing international tensions.

The Soviet government believes that after the cessation of the Korean War and the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, favorable conditions have been created to start discussing the issue of adopting measures to promote a general easing of international tensions, including the issue of arms reduction and the issue of prohibiting the establishment of foreign military bases in other countries' territories.

The Soviet government suggested holding a five-nation foreign ministers conference with France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to discuss measures to ease international tensions, and suggested holding a four-nation foreign ministers conference to discuss the German question, including the restoration of German unity and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

In the exchange of notes before the end of last year, a complete agreement could not be reached, because the United States, the United Kingdom, and France opposed holding the above-mentioned five-nation conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, the Soviet government stated that it would raise this issue at the Berlin Four-Power Representatives Conference of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. An agreement was reached in this regard.

We put forward the following agenda at the Berlin Conference:

1.  Measures to ease international tensions and to convene a conference of foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China;
2.  The German question and the task of ensuring European security;
3.  The question of the Austrian peace treaty.

Although with some reservations, the conference accepted this agenda.

We must not forget how the Western countries prepared public opinion before the Berlin Conference. The basic guidelines of the U.S.-British foreign policy I mentioned above are also reflected in this preparatory work.

Until the last moment, the ruling groups in the United States and the United Kingdom were doing everything possible to put pressure on the Soviet Union. Not only the newspapers of these groups, but even government officials repeatedly said that it was useless to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and that the Berlin Conference was doomed to failure. Although the reactionary newspapers adopted various means of exerting pressure, even threatening to directly sabotage the conference, they still could not hide the fact that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had interests in the Berlin Conference.

The governments of these countries had to take into account the increasing pressure from people from the democratic society, who demanded that the four-nation representatives' conference consider the aspirations of the people of all countries for easing international tensions. The upsurge of the national liberation movement of the people in various places, especially in Asia, also had the same impact.

It has been proven that France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have considerable interests in convening the Berlin Conference.

Before talking about some agreements reached at the Berlin Conference, it is necessary to first talk about the differences between the Soviet position and the position of the Western three countries as expressed at the conference.

(II)

The conference paid the most attention to the German question. As everyone knows, this is the main problem that has not been solved after the war. The four countries that sent representatives to the Berlin Conference have a special responsibility for the correct solution of this problem. That is to say, the solution of the German question should take into account the interests of guaranteeing peace and European security, and should conform to the national interests of democratic Germany.

The discussion process fully demonstrated the essence of the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. However, this does not mean that France's attitude towards the German question is completely consistent with the attitude of the ruling groups of the United States and the United Kingdom towards this question.

The Soviet Union has always believed that the task of guaranteeing peace and European security is first of all closely related to preventing the revival of German militarism.

Therefore, measures to restore German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis should not be delayed. This position is fully in line with the agreements signed by the anti-Hitler allied countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union) during the war and immediately after the war, and France later agreed to these agreements as well.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have abandoned this position, torn up the most important international agreements they once signed, and are engaged in the revival of German militarism. Since it is currently not possible to do this in the whole of Germany, they are vigorously preparing to remilitarize West Germany, and in this regard they rely on the Adenauer government in Bonn.

If the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, like the Soviet government, agreed not to allow the revival of German militarism, then the solution of other disputed issues would be much easier.

This also means that the four governments should rely not on German militarists and revanchists in this matter, but on the democratic, peace-loving forces in Germany that express the true wishes of the German people.

The Berlin Conference proved that the German question was also affected by the U.S.-British diplomatic policy, which was expressed as a "strength" policy or a "peace based on strength" policy.

Facts such as the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty signed in May 1952 prove this. These two treaties make the danger of German militarism revival imminent.

According to the Paris Treaty, a so-called "European Defense Community" is to be established for a period of fifty years, and under the banner of this community, an "European Army" is to be composed of the armed forces of six countries, namely France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. It can be seen from this that among about thirty European countries, six European countries including West Germany actually attempt to establish a narrow, exclusive military group, and although four-fifths of the countries do not participate in this group, they illegally hang a "European" sign. This treaty legitimizes the reconstruction of the West German army (Bundeswehr) and West Germany's participation in the above-mentioned military group. Initially, it was planned to establish twelve West German divisions, but now there are plans to further increase the strength of this army, and now some people are talking about establishing twenty-five or even sixty West German divisions, which is not accidental. When it comes to this, one cannot ignore the fact that recently the West German parliament (Bundestag) violated the current constitution and passed a resolution stipulating that all West German men over the age of eighteen should be conscripted into the army. This allows the Adenauer government to build up its army without restraint.

In addition to the Paris Treaty signed by the six countries, a Bonn Treaty was also signed at that time. This treaty was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany. The Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are complementary.

According to the Bonn Treaty, the armies of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will be stationed in West Germany for decades, turning West Germany into a semi-occupied country. The Adenauer government, which is the main pillar of those West German revanchists who are trying to clear the way for the revival of German militarism today, also signed this treaty. West German revanchists today advocate signing the Bonn Treaty, which insults the German people. However, there is no doubt that when the West German army under the command of Hitler's generals is established according to the Paris Treaty, the West German revanchists will disregard their signatures. At that time, their true purpose will be exposed, and their aggressive revanchist plans will be exposed, and the first to bear the brunt will be Germany's neighbors.

At the same time as the signing of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France announced a declaration aimed at vigorously supporting and accelerating the establishment of the "European Defense Community," that is, the establishment of the "European Army."

All of this reveals the far-reaching plans of the ruling groups of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and the signing of the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty was precisely to implement these plans. Although the United States and the United Kingdom do not intend to add their armies to the "European Army," they are trying to become the actual masters of the "European Army." The conspiracy to establish a "European Army" including the West German militarist army can only have one explanation, and that is to plot a new war in Europe. And it is obvious that the U.S. ruling groups are trying to use the hands of the "Europeans" to carry out this new war.

After the establishment of the "European Army," since the French army will join the "European Army," then France will be the only one of the five major countries that may not have its own army. There is no doubt that the West German army will dominate the "European Army." In this way, France has seriously undermined the fundamental basis of the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in 1944 to prevent the resurgence of German militarist aggression. Some French ministers are willing to accept all this, but it is puzzling how this position can be reconciled with France's national dignity and interests.

As everyone knows, the parliaments of France, Belgium, and Italy have not yet ratified the Paris Treaty, so the Paris Treaty has not yet come into effect. However, recently the pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom on these countries, especially France, has been increasing, demanding that they ratify this treaty and put it into effect.

At the Berlin Conference, not only Dulles and Eden, but even French Foreign Minister Bidault, collected various excuses to defend the Paris Treaty and the establishment of the "European Defense Community." They even said that these treaties signed with West Germany are not formally binding on the future unified Germany. If German militarists and revanchists are truly able to use the possibility of restoring West German militarism provided by the Paris Treaty, then they will bring out these statements by the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

However, it is clear today that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the Adenauer government, are in fact eliminating the possibility of unifying West Germany and East Germany into a unified Germany. According to the Paris Treaty, they say bluntly that if this treaty is not extended to the unified whole Germany, then they will not let the two parts of Germany unite, that is, they will not allow the establishment of a unified and independent Germany. All of these vividly illustrates how little importance they attach to all their other suggestions regarding the German question.

One can think that the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France attending the Berlin Conference were not interested in truly solving the German question, or even solving any practical problem that is of great significance to the German people. Their attention was focused on one goal: to pave the way for the establishment of the "European Army" according to the Paris Treaty, which opens the door for the revival of West German militarism.

At the Berlin Conference, even the Soviet Union's suggestion to listen to the opinions of the Germans and understand how the German people themselves think about the urgent task of unifying Germany and the German people's participation in ensuring peace and European security was not adopted. The West German government also disagrees with this. Everyone can see that this government is unwilling to meet with the East German government, that is, the government of the German Democratic Republic, which opposes the plan to revive German militarism, at a table. However, in the current situation, it is precisely the German Democratic Republic that expresses the true wishes of all peace-loving German people, and expresses the true wishes of the German people to seek peace and to maintain friendly relations with all countries. The refusal to listen to the opinions of the German representatives shows how the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France do not want to seriously discuss the German question.

The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France refused to discuss the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, nor did they put forward their own draft peace treaty with Germany. They even refused to study how to accelerate the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany, although a four-nation foreign ministers conference had already begun to study this issue in detail several years ago.

The Western three foreign ministers refused to discuss the issue of forming a temporary all-German government composed of representatives of the East and West German parliaments, although this is a practical step to restore German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. They also refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to establish two all-German committees: one all-German committee is responsible for improving economic and administrative relations between East and West Germany, and the other all-German committee is responsible for improving the conditions for developing German national culture. They refused to take any practical steps to bring East Germany and West Germany closer together, although this is the most reliable way to restore German unity. The foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France did not consider the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the financial and economic obligations borne by East and West Germany due to the consequences of the war. They certainly know that in East Germany, this measure has been implemented, for example, occupation fees have been reduced to no more than 4.5 percent of East Germany's national budget revenue. In West Germany, taxes are increasing and occupation fees are also increasing. This year's occupation fees account for almost 35 percent of West Germany's total national budget revenue.

The suggestions of the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on the German question can be simply summarized as one thing - holding so-called "free elections" in East and West Germany. However, even this suggestion has nothing in common with solving the German question in accordance with the needs of guaranteeing peace and European security, and holding truly free elections. And this suggestion is full of distrust of the German people and their democratic forces.

Even such a purely domestic German affair is not allowed to be carried out by the Germans, but must be handed over to the occupying authorities. The Soviet Union suggested that the four countries assist the Germans in forming a temporary all-German government composed of representatives of the East and West German parliaments and various democratic groups, and then this government itself will hold free all-German elections. This suggestion of the Soviet Union was also not adopted.

Another suggestion we made was also not adopted. That is, before the all-German elections, all occupying forces should be withdrawn from East and West Germany, leaving only troops whose numbers are strictly limited. The purpose of this Soviet suggestion is to prevent the occupying authorities from exerting pressure on the elections. However, those who advocate so-called "free elections" rejected this suggestion, which is most in line with the needs of truly free elections.

Dulles is now also giving speeches on the Berlin Conference. He pretends to be an ardent supporter of the people's "freedom," a supporter of "free elections." But we know that not all words about "freedom" are in defense of the true freedom of the people, the working people. What some "defenders" of freedom like is a kind of "freedom" under which exploiters and militarists can do whatever they want, they can live in luxury, while the working people are under the constant threat of war and new massacres. Of course, we do not approve of this "freedom." We approve of true freedom. Under this freedom, militarists cannot drag the people into new bloody wars.

As everyone knows, in the past, in 1932-1933, Hitler and his party came to power through so-called "free elections." Hitler did not quickly become the German Chancellor. At first, it was people like Adenauer at that time who cleared the way for him, such as the famous Papen, who belonged to the same political party as the current Bonn Chancellor Adenauer. Everyone remembers very well that it was the German monopoly capital giants who made a fortune by expanding military industries who supported Hitler and his assistants like Papen at that time.

Now it is also those German monopoly capital giants who support the Adenauer group, which dreams of accelerating the rearmament of West Germany. They pin their hopes on new expansions of armaments to obtain new high profits and super-profits, and they connect their interests first of all with the plan to revive German militarism.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France verbally advocate free elections, but in fact they refuse to have any contact with the democratic and peaceful forces of the German people. What they intend is: the kind of freedom that they hope to give to Germany is best guaranteed by the occupying authorities relying on the occupying forces. Such distrust of Germany's democratic and peaceful forces not only cannot help Germany to further develop on a democratic and peaceful basis, but is also directly supporting those German militarists and revanchists, who have already used this support in West Germany to achieve their goals.

The current German policy of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France is completely subordinate to the plan to establish the "European Defense Community," that is, the "European Army," which leads to the revival of West German militarism. This approach cannot consolidate peace in Europe. Moreover, under this approach, since West Germany is no longer a peaceful country, and since it has become impossible to unify Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, then the road to restoring German unity has also been cut off.

The Soviet Union favors another policy, another approach, on the German question.

This has been demonstrated in the Soviet Union's proposals on the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty, on the unification of Germany, on the establishment of a temporary all-German government, and on holding free all-German elections. The purpose of these proposals is to do everything possible to accelerate Germany's national unity, while ensuring that Germany can further develop on a democratic and peaceful basis. It is quite clear that the Soviet Union's proposals can prevent Germany from becoming a dangerous source of aggression in Europe again. The starting point of these proposals is to prevent the revival of German militarism.

It can be seen that the solution of the German question currently depends on a fundamental question: whether to allow German militarism to revive, or not to allow German militarism to revive. It must be pointed out that within countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and even West Germany, in addition to government groups, they are doing their best to oppose the policy of establishing a European army and reviving West German militarism.

For example, in France, the growing opposition to this policy comes not only from workers and other strata of the working people, but also from bourgeois groups. This resistance in the French Parliament is intensifying. It is no accident that the British people are widely dissatisfied with this policy, and that almost half of the Labor Party MPs oppose this policy, which is maintained by the right-wing leaders of the Labor Party. It is understandable that in West Germany, the Social Democrats, taking into account the mood of the masses, continue to oppose the Adenauer policy, which advocates accelerating the revival of German militarism at the expense of restoring German unity. The policy of reviving German militarism has caused reasonable panic in various European countries.

There is every reason to raise a question about this policy: Which way is things developing? Towards consolidating peace, or towards a new war? What does the current approach of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to the German question lead to?

This approach leads to the establishment of military groups in some European countries to oppose other European countries. To go this way is to give up consolidating peace and European security. To go this way is to prepare for another war in Europe, and the result is leading to the Third World War.

Do France, Italy, Belgium, and other European countries and their comrades really have to go this way for the sake of security? Is it really necessary to establish a "European Defense Community" and at the same time remilitarize Germany in order to guarantee their security and European peace?

Recently, especially in France, people have asked more than once whether there is something to replace the "European Defense Community?" That is to say, what can replace this notorious "group"? If a "European Army" based on the revival of West German militarism is not established, can peace and European security be guaranteed? Although these questions have been raised more than once, the purpose of doing so is usually only to indirectly justify the plans stipulated in the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty.

At the Berlin Conference, the Soviet Union put forward a concrete plan in response to the plan to establish military groups in some European countries. According to this plan, guaranteeing peace and the security of European countries would have a solid foundation. This plan is the Soviet Union's draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security."

The "All-European Treaty" makes corresponding guarantees to prevent aggression and prevent damage to European peace. All countries in Europe, regardless of their social system, can participate in this treaty. Before Germany is restored to unity, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany can also participate in this treaty, and after Germany is restored to unity, the unified Germany will participate in this treaty.

This treaty stipulates that if any contracting party is subjected to armed aggression, the other contracting parties shall provide assistance to that country in every possible way, including the use of armed forces, to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe.

At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal stipulates that the situation in Germany should be greatly improved at present, and that the occupying forces of various countries should be withdrawn from the entire territory of Germany, leaving only troops whose numbers are strictly limited.

The purpose of the Soviet Union's proposal is to establish an effective European collective security system to replace military groups composed of some European countries that are opposed to each other.

Since 1947, there has been a regional Pan-American Mutual Assistance Treaty, in which the United States and all countries in Latin America participate. Such a regional treaty has its positive significance if it is only for defensive purposes. Of course, attempts by the U.S. ruling groups to use this treaty to obtain selfish interests under the pretext of resisting communism cannot be considered legitimate. The Soviet delegation refuted the objections to the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security," pointing out that these direct objections to the regional European treaty were untenable. Such a treaty with a truly defensive nature is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

At the Berlin Conference, it was mentioned more than once that the current world is divided and that there are countries with different social systems. Naturally, this fact must be taken into account, and it must be taken into account that not only the Soviet Union, but also many countries have embarked on the road of socialism and people's democracy, and are advancing victoriously along this road.

We consider this to be the greatest achievement of the 20th century. We are not prepared to deny the fact that the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism now unites several countries with a population of 800 million. The growth of the strength of this democratic camp is obvious, and indeed in many ways it is truly worthy of learning from.

However, we have always consistently adhered to Lenin's principle that countries with different social systems can coexist.

We believe that, for example, in Europe, despite the existence of various different social systems, the people of all European countries are concerned about guaranteeing and consolidating peace. We hope that on the issue of defending peace, there will be no division into two camps, whether in Europe or throughout the world. We call on all European countries to refuse to establish military groups that are opposed to each other, because the establishment of such groups cannot but lead to war. We suggest that a single camp be formed by European countries that are willing to guarantee their security and consolidate European peace.

In this European security system, no country, even a powerful country, should be in a dominant position. The sovereignty of all countries participating in this collective security system must be guaranteed and protected from external infringement. The draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" is based on the above principles.

This draft was not supported by the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. But no foreign minister was able to reject the idea of ​​European collective security. The people understand this idea. This idea has won the sympathy of all peace-loving people.

The idea of ​​an All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security will continue to penetrate the hearts of millions of people and will most reliably promote the cause of peace and security in Europe and the world. The Soviet Union advocates that German troops should not be allowed to be established before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded, that is, Germany should remain neutral during this period.

Naturally, some ministers may continue to formulate various plans to establish the "European Defense Community" and to remilitarize West Germany. However, this will not achieve anything other than producing an unreliable military group that is not supported by the people. Another situation is the idea of ​​European collective security, which is embodied in the All-European Treaty, or it may be other forms. The people of European countries are increasingly sympathetic to this idea, because this idea expresses their heartfelt desire to consolidate peace and establish universal security.

The Soviet government has never concealed its opposition to the North Atlantic Treaty, which demonstrates the intention of the U.S.-British bloc to dominate the world. The attempt to establish the "European Defense Community," thereby directly promoting the revival of German militarism, has deepened the existing differences in many ways. The Soviet government opposes these differences being deepened. We are committed to resolving disputes in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace. In this particular case, it is particularly evident that the Soviet Union expressed the feelings and thoughts of all peace-loving people in Europe (and not just Europe).

The discussion on the German question at the Berlin Conference proved that the differences between the Soviet Union and the Western three countries primarily exist on the issue of German militarism, because there are now plans to revive German militarism. Since the Soviet Union once shouldered the main burden in the struggle against Hitler's aggression, it cannot but give sufficient estimates to the new aggressive dangers that will arise once German militarism revives.

The growing threat of West Germany's re-militarization cannot but have an impact on the Austrian question.

At the Berlin Conference, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France expressed their willingness to withdraw their objections to some of the clauses in the draft Austrian peace treaty, which they had been opposing for the past five years. This is enough to show how unfounded their past objections were.

The Soviet side had stated at the Berlin Conference that if the two suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union, which had become necessary due to the signing of the Paris Treaty to establish the "European Defense Community," were adopted, it would be prepared to immediately sign the Austrian peace treaty.

These two suggestions are:

First, we suggest that Austria should guarantee not to participate in any military group aimed at opposing any country that had sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria. Austria must also not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory;

Second, we advocate that a clause should be included in the Austrian peace treaty: In view of the delay in the signing of the peace treaty with Germany, the four foreign troops currently stationed in Austria can continue to stay there, and the issue of the time limit for the withdrawal of the four countries' troops from Austrian territory should be re-examined no later than 1955. If there is no plan to establish a "European Army," this additional clause would certainly not be necessary. This additional clause is necessary because the United States and the United Kingdom are now exerting various pressures to get France and other countries to agree to the revival of West German militarism, which naturally deepens the danger of a new Anschluss between Germany and Austria.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France did not agree to the Soviet Union's two supplementary suggestions on the Austrian peace treaty. They also prevented the Austrian government from treating these suggestions with due understanding. As a result, the Austrian peace treaty could not be signed.

The above-mentioned facts prove that the responsibility for the failure to sign the Austrian peace treaty should be attributed to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, who are unwilling to abandon the plan to revive German militarism, and their unwillingness to abandon this plan has deepened the danger of a new Anschluss between Germany and Austria.

Currently, attempts by officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Austria to blame the Soviet Union for the failure

    就柏林四国外长会议的结果
    莫洛托夫外长发表声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫发表声明如下：
    法国、英国、美国、苏联的外交部长从一月二十五日到二月十八日在柏林举行了会议。这个会议讨论了几个重要国际问题。
    上次四国外长会议是一九四九年春天举行的。在过去的五年中没有开过这样的会议。这次柏林会议一致得出结论：必须举行有法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国外交部长参加的另一个会议。这一点具有肯定的国际意义。
    （一）
    最近五年来，资本主义国家阵营战后发展的趋势生动地显示出来了。大家现在都很清楚，美国统治集团力求充当这个阵营的领导角色，而且他们所贪求的还不止于此。他们恬不知耻地说，他们承担了“领导世界的担子”，说什么美国是“世界的领导者”。虽然，这些断言是毫无依据的。
    这种企图具体表现为，在美国政府发起下、并得到英国统治集团的积极支持于一九四九年组成了北大西洋集团。在北大西洋公约上签字的有美国、加拿大、英国、法国、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、丹麦、挪威、冰岛、葡萄牙、意大利、希腊和土耳其。其中有些国家是因为受到外部的直接压力才在这个公约上签字的。这个公约实际上是美英集团的工具，也就是说，美国想利用这个条约来建立自己的世界霸权。北大西洋公约类似大家所知道的“反共产国际协定”。“反共产国际协定”是希特勒德国、军国主义日本和法西斯意大利在一九三七年签订的，其矛头当初是针对着苏联的。没有理由怀疑，北大西洋公约的命运不会比“反共产国际协定”的命运好些。
    在公开地追求世界霸权的同时，美国的统治集团，还有英国的统治集团，开始愈来愈强调他们要执行“实力”外交政策。这并不是什么出乎意料的事情。从称霸世界的企图到“实力”政策或“以实力为基础的和平”的政策，只有一步之差。
    宣扬这种政策的不仅是美国和英国，还有北大西洋集团的其他国家，而其后果怎样，我们大家都很清楚。
    这种政策的直接表现就是近来所进行的扩充军备。美国、英国、法国、比利时、挪威以及这个集团的其他国家扩充军备已达到空前的规模。这种扩充军备已使美国和欧洲的垄断资本家发了大财。但这些国家的人民和劳动人民却因此而承受了力不胜任的赋税重担，饱尝了物价高涨的苦头。
    原子弹恐吓特别受到看重。然而这也维持不了多久。现在谁都看到，以美国在原子弹上占垄断地位的空想为基础的盘算已证明是完全落空了。
    在扩充军备的同时，美国和英国在欧洲及其附属领土上大事建筑军事基地。这些军事基地的建筑是公开为了反对苏联和人民民主国家的，这就说明美国军事基地的建筑和防御毫无共同之处。
    随着“实力”政策而来的是两年前签订了建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约。这个条约规定恢复西德的武装力量。现在有人又策划复活德国军国主义，而还在不久以前，不仅法国及其他欧洲国家，甚至美国和英国都曾反对过德国军国主义的再起。这就在德国问题的解决上产生了新的、极为严重的困难。
    美国在国际事务中的其他许多行动，也体现了“实力”政策。
    譬如说，美国和英国以及这个阵营的其他国家近几年来共同对苏联、中华人民共和国及人民民主国家实行各种关于国际贸易的歧视措施。虽然这个政策已经给美国和英国带来巨大的损害，然而它们却仍然以各种借口，采取各种方式，施加压力，来继续阻挠正常的国际贸易，在和民主阵营各国建立经济关系上加以限制，制造困难。然而，这种政策却发生了相反的后果。这些年来，苏联、中国和人民民主国家之间的经济联系大大地加强了，而且这些国家的经济年年高涨。
    现在大家都看到，美英统治集团执行的“实力”政策，不论在政治方面还是经济方面，都没有产生良好的结果。这种政策在军事方面也遭到惨败。
    这个政策首先在朝鲜没有经得住考验。它没有使美国取得军事胜利。美国对朝鲜进行军事干涉以后，丧失了它的军事威望和道义威信。在人民为了自己的民族权利、独立和自由而进行顽强斗争的国度里，这种政策不能不以失败告终。
    尽管美国在印度支那给法国各种援助，“实力”政策在那里也没有得到什么好结果。在那里，法国的殖民政策以及美国奉行的支持“殖民主义”的政策，遭到一次又一次的失败。在印度支那对为自由而斗争的人民所进行的旷日持久的战争，不但没有为“实力”政策增光，反而使这一政策威信扫地。
    除此以外，还必须补充一句：正是在过去五年之中，使中国人民摆脱了外国帝国主义的暴力统治的中华人民共和国，不但成立了，而且巩固下来了。这一事实使整个亚洲的局势发生了根本的变化。这一事实对于整个国际关系的进一步发展具有极其重要的作用。
    正是对于中国，过去和现在都特别顽固地、极端荒谬地采用了“实力”政策。然而恰恰就在这里，这种政策的失败具有特别的说服力。
    近几年来，社会主义和人民民主阵营在很多方面发展和加强了。在这些年代里，形成了第二个世界市场。这个市场包括民主阵营内的高度工业化的国家和农业—工业国。这些国家之间的政治关系是循着合作日益紧密和友谊日益增长的道路发展的。
    美国统治集团和美英集团各国所奉行的“实力”政策意味着什么呢？归根到底，这种政策不外是准备新战争的外交政策和国内政策。除此以外，别无其他。这种政策是不会得到人民牢固的支持的。
    苏联的外交政策和美国这种政策不同，它的目的是要巩固和平和国际合作。苏联的政策是从这样一个基本立场出发的，就是没有任何国际争端不能以和平方式获得解决。这就是巩固和平的政策。这种政策符合于各国友好合作的利益，有助于团结世界各国的爱好和平的力量。
    直到不久以前，美英的上述外交政策方针还在一定程度上左右了资本主义阵营中的大多数国家。实行“实力”政策，就必然只能使国际紧张局势加剧。这影响到欧洲，也影响到亚洲，这已经影响到而且还正影响着世界的各个角落。
    由于中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主动，朝鲜战争去年得以停止，从而使国际形势发生了重要的变化。
    朝鲜停战协定的签订，有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。这就使得苏联有可能提出进一步缓和国际紧张局势的问题。柏林会议的召开本身就证明了：在目前的条件下，这种可能是存在的。在柏林会议召开之前，苏联政府和美、英、法三国政府之间多次交换照会。照会的交换有它的作用。这改善了召开柏林会议的条件。
    西方三国政府主张柏林会议只限于讨论与德国问题有关的一些问题和对奥和约问题。它们力求避免讨论其他问题和缓和国际紧张局势的总的问题。
    苏联政府则认为：在朝鲜战争停止和朝鲜停战协定签订之后，产生了有利的条件，可以着手讨论采取促使国际紧张局势普遍缓和的措施的问题，包括裁减军备问题和禁止在别国领土上建立外国军事基地的问题在内。
    苏联政府建议举行法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国五大国外长会议，以讨论缓和国际紧张局势的措施的问题，并建议举行四国外长会议，以讨论德国问题，包括恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约的问题。
    在去年年底以前的照会来往中，没有能达成完全的协议，因为美、英、法三国反对举行上述有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议。于是苏联政府就声明，它将在柏林法、英、美、苏四国代表会议上提出这个问题。在这方面达成了协议。
    我们在柏林会议上提出了下列议程：
    一、关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议；
    二、德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务；
    三、关于对奥和约问题。
    虽然有某些保留，会议接受了这一议程。
    我们不能忘记的是，在柏林会议以前，西方国家是如何进行舆论准备的。我在上面谈到的美英外交政策的基本方针也体现在这一准备工作中。
    直到最后时刻，美国和英国的统治集团还在用尽各种办法来向苏联施加压力。不但这些集团的报纸，而且连政府人士都口口声声说，和苏联谈判是没有益处的，柏林会议注定必然失败。反动报纸虽然采取各式各样的施加压力的手段，甚至以直接破坏会议来要挟，但是它们还是不能隐瞒美、英、法三国是与柏林会议有利害关系的。
    这些国家的政府不能不考虑到民主社会人士日益增强的压力，民主社会人士要求四国代表会议考虑各国人民对缓和国际紧张局势的愿望。各地人民，特别是亚洲人民的民族解放运动的高涨，也产生了同样的影响。
    事实证明，法国、英国和美国跟召开柏林会议是有相当大的利害关系的。
    在谈到柏林会议上所达成的一些协议以前，必须先谈谈在会议上所表现出的苏联立场和西方三国立场间的分歧。
    （二）
    会议最注意德国问题。大家知道，这是战后没有解决的问题中的主要问题。而派代表参加柏林会议的四个国家，对这个问题的正确解决负有特殊的责任。这就是说，解决德国问题应当考虑到保障和平和欧洲安全的利益，应当符合民主德国的民族利益。
    讨论的过程充分说明了：苏联和美国、英国、法国分歧的本质所在。但是，这并不是说，在法国对德国问题的态度，是和美国与英国的统治集团对这个问题的态度完全一致的。
    苏联过去和现在一直认为：保障和平和欧洲安全的任务首先是与防止德国军国主义复活这一点密切相关的。
    因此，不应拖延采取在民主和平的基础上恢复德国统一的措施。这种立场是完全符合反希特勒同盟国家（美国、英国和苏联）在战时和战争刚结束后所签订的那些协定的，法国后来也同意了这些协定。
    美国、英国和法国政府却离开了这种立场，撕毁了它们曾经在上面签字的那些最重要的国际协定，而从事复活德国军国主义。由于目前还不可能在全德国这样干，所以它们就大力准备使德国西部重新军国主义化，在这方面它们依靠着波恩的阿登纳政府。
    如果法国、英国、美国政府也和苏联政府一样，同意不允许德国军国主义复活，那末其他争执问题的解决也就要容易得多了。
    这同时还意味着，四国政府在这件事情上应当依靠的不是德国军国主义者和复仇主义者，而是应当依靠表达德国人民真正愿望的德国民主的、爱好和平的力量。
    柏林会议证明，在德国问题上也同样受到表现为“实力”政策或“以实力为基础的和平”政策的美英集团外交方针的影响。
    像一九五二年五月签订的巴黎条约和波恩条约这一类的事实，就证明了这一点。这两个条约使德国军国主义复活的危险迫在眉睫。
    根据巴黎条约，要建立一个为期五十年的所谓“欧洲防务集团”，并在这一集团的旗帜下，由法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和西德六国的武装部队组成一支“欧洲军”。由此可见，在共约三十个欧洲国家中，包括西德在内的六个欧洲国家居然企图建立一个狭隘的、排外的军事集团，而且尽管五分之四的国家没有参加这个集团，它们却非法地挂上了一块“欧洲”招牌。这个条约使重建西德军队（国防军）及西德参加上述军事集团合法化。起初准备建立十二个西德师，然而现在已在计划进一步增加这支军队的力量，现在已经有人在谈论建立二十五个、甚至六十个西德师了，这并不是偶然的。谈到这一点，不能忽视这个事实：最近西德议会（联邦议院）违反现行宪法，通过决议，规定西德年满十八岁的男子一律应服兵役。这一来就让阿登纳政府可以放手建立军队了。
    除了六国签字的巴黎条约以外，那时还签订了一个波恩条约，这个条约是美国、英国、法国和西德签订的。波恩条约和巴黎条约是互相补充的。
      根据波恩条约，美国、英国和法国的军队将在西德境内驻扎几十年，把西德变成一个半被占领的国家。在这个条约上签字的还有阿登纳政府，而阿登纳政府是今天那些企图为复活德国军国主义扫清道路的西德复仇主义分子的主要支柱。西德复仇主义分子今天赞成签订侮辱德国人民的波恩条约。然而，勿庸置疑，当根据巴黎条约建立起了在希特勒将领指挥下的西德军队的时候，西德的复仇主义分子就会不顾及他们的签字了。那时他们的真正目的就会暴露出来，他们的侵略性的复仇盘算就会暴露出来，而首当其冲的就是德国的邻国。
    与巴黎条约和波恩条约签订的同时，美、英、法三国宣言公布了，这个宣言的目的是要竭力支持和加速建立“欧洲防务集团”，也就是建立“欧洲军”。
    所有这些都揭示出美、英、法三国统治集团的用意深远的计划，而巴黎条约和波恩条约的签订也正是为了执行这些计划。虽然美国和英国不打算把它们的军队加入“欧洲军”，但它们却企图要成为“欧洲军”的实际主人。企图建立包括西德军国主义军队在内的“欧洲军”的阴谋只能有一个解释，就是图谋在欧洲准备新战争。而且明显的是，美国统治集团是企图借“欧洲人”之手来进行这个新战争的。
      “欧洲军”建立后，既然法国的军队将加入“欧洲军”，这样五大国之中就只有法国一国没有可能有本国军队了。勿庸置疑，在“欧洲军”中占统治地位的将是西德的军队。这样一来，法国就严重地破坏了一九四四年为了防止德国军国主义侵略再起而签订的法苏条约的根本基础。法国有些部长愿意接受这一切，然而令人不解的是，这种立场如何能和法国的民族尊严和利益相协调。
    大家知道，法国、比利时和意大利的议会还没有批准巴黎条约，因此巴黎条约还没有生效。但是，最近美国和英国对这些国家，特别是对法国的压力愈来愈大，要求它们批准这个条约并将其付诸实施。
    在柏林会议上不仅是杜勒斯和艾登，连法国外交部长皮杜尔也搜集了种种借口来为巴黎条约辩解，为建立“欧洲防务集团”辩解。他们甚至说，与西德签订的这些条约在形式上对将来的统一的德国并无约束力。如果德国军国主义者和复仇主义者一旦真正能够利用巴黎条约所提供的恢复西德军国主义的可能性的话，那时他们一定会把法国、英国和美国外交部长的这些声明拿出来。
    但是，在今天很明显的是，美国、英国和法国政府以及阿登纳政府事实上在消灭把西德和东德统一成为一个统一的德国的可能性。它们根据巴黎条约直言不讳地说，如果不把这个条约扩大到统一的全德国实行，那末它们就不让德国的两部分统一起来，也就是说，不允许建立一个统一的独立的德国。所有这些生动地说明，它们是如何不重视它们自己关于德国问题的其他一切建议。
    人们可以这样认为：出席柏林会议的美、英、法三国外交部长对真正解决德国问题，甚至解决任何一个对德国人民具有重大意义的实际问题，是不感兴趣的。他们的注意集中在一个目标上：根据那替复活西德军国主义打开大门的巴黎条约，为建立“欧洲军”铺平道路。
    在柏林会议上甚至连苏联的这样一个建议都没有通过：听听德国人的意见，了解一下德国人民自己对统一德国的紧要任务和德国人民参与保障和平与欧洲安全的问题如何想法。西德政府也不同意这一点。大家可以看出，这个政府是不愿意和东德政府，即反对复活德国军国主义的计划的德意志民主共和国政府在一张桌子上相会的。然而在目前情况下，正是德意志民主共和国表达了所有爱好和平的德国人民的真正愿望，表达了德国人民要求和平、要求和各国保持友好关系的真正愿望。拒绝倾听德国代表的意见这一点，可以表明美、英、法三国的代表是如何不想认真地讨论德国问题。
    美、英、法三国的外交部长不愿讨论苏联的对德和约草案，也不提出自己的对德和约草案。他们甚至拒绝研究如何加速准备对德和约的问题，尽管几年以前的一次四国外长会议就已经着手详细研究这个问题了。
    西方三国的外长拒绝讨论由东、西德议会的代表组成临时的全德政府的问题，尽管这是一个在民主与和平的基础上恢复德国统一的实际步骤。他们也拒绝接受苏联提出的关于成立两个全德委员会的建议：一个全德委员会负责改善东、西德之间的经济和行政关系，另一个全德委员会负责改善发展德国民族文化的条件。他们拒绝采取任何实际步骤来使东德和西德接近起来，尽管这是恢复德国统一的最可靠的道路。美、英、法三国外长没有考虑苏联关于减轻东德和西德由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的建议。他们当然知道，在东德，这种措施已经实行了，例如占领费已经减少到不超过东德国家预算收入的百分之四点五。而在西德，赋税日益加重，占领费也在日益增加。今年的占领费几乎占西德全部国家预算收入的百分之三十五。
    美、英、法三国外长关于德国问题的建议简单说来就是一个东西——在东、西德举行所谓“自由选举”。然而就是这个建议也和按照保障和平与欧洲安全的需要来解决德国问题，和举行真正自由的选举，毫无共同之处。而且这个建议充满了对德国人民及其民主力量的不信任。
    甚至这样一个纯粹是德国内政的事情都不让德国人来进行，而要交给占领当局来进行。苏联建议四国协助德国人成立一个由东、西德议会和各民主团体代表组成的临时的全德政府，然后由这个政府自己来举行全德自由选举。苏联这个建议也没有被采纳。
    我们提出的另外一个建议也没有被采纳。这就是在全德选举之前，从东德和西德境内撤退一切占领军，只留下数量上严格加以限制的部队。苏联这一建议目的在于不让占领当局对选举施加压力。然而，主张所谓“自由选举”的人拒绝了这一最符合于真正自由选举的需要的建议。
    杜勒斯现在也正在就柏林会议发表演说。他装做是一个热心拥护人民“自由”的人，一个拥护“自由选举”的人。但是我们知道，并不是所有关于“自由”的言词，就是在维护人民的、劳动人民的真正自由。某些自由的“维护者”所喜欢的是这样一种“自由”，在这种“自由”下，剥削者和军国主义分子可以为所欲为，他们可以过优裕的生活，而劳动人民则处在战争和新的屠杀的经常威胁之下。我们当然是不赞成这种“自由”的。我们赞成的是真正的自由。在这种自由之下，军国主义分子不可能把人民拖入新的流血战争。
    大家知道，在以前，在一九三二—一九三三年，希特勒及其党徒也是经过所谓“自由选举”而当权的。希特勒并不是很快就当上了德国总理的。起初是由那个时候的阿登纳之流替他扫清道路，例如著名的巴本，他是和现在波恩总理阿登纳曾同属一个政党的。大家记得很清楚，当时替希特勒和他的助手像巴本之类撑腰的是德国的垄断资本巨头，他们靠扩大军事工业而大发横财。
    现在替梦想加速重新武装西德的阿登纳集团撑腰的也是那些德国垄断资本巨头，他们把获得新的高额利润和超额利润的打算寄托在新的扩充军备上，他们把自己的利益首先和复活德国军国主义的计划联结在一起。
    美、英、法三国政府口头上主张自由选举，实际上却拒绝和德国人民的民主和平力量发生任何关系。他们打算的是：他们所希望给予德国的那种自由，最好由占领当局依靠占领军队来加以保证。对德国的民主与和平力量这样的不相信，不仅不能有助于德国在民主与和平的基础上得到进一步的发展，而且是在直接支持那些德国军国主义者和复仇主义者，他们已在西德利用这种支持以达到自己的目的了。
    美、英、法三国政府目前的对德政策，完全服从于导致西德军国主义的复活的建立“欧洲防务集团”、即“欧洲军”的计划。这种方针不能巩固欧洲的和平。而且，在这种方针下，既然西德不再是一个和平的国家，既然在民主和平的基础上统一德国成为不可能了，那也就切断了恢复德国统一的道路。
    苏联在德国问题上赞成另外一种政策，另外一种方针。
    这已经在苏联关于迅速缔结和约、关于统一德国、建立临时的全德政府及举行全德自由选举的建议之中表现出来了。这些建议的目的是尽力加速德国的全国统一，同时保证德国能在民主和平的基础上得到进一步的发展。十分明显，苏联的建议可以使德国不致再度变为侵略欧洲的危险的策源地。这些建议的出发点就是不让德国军国主义复活。
    可见，德国问题的解决目前决定于一个基本问题：让德国军国主义复活呢，还是不让德国军国主义复活。必须指出，在法国、英国，甚至西德这样一些国家之内，除了政府集团以外，都竭力反对建立欧洲军和复活西德军国主义的政策。
    例如，在法国，对于这个政策的日益增长的反对，不仅来自工人和劳动人民的其他阶层之中，而且也来自资产阶级集团之中。法国议会中这种反抗日益加剧。英国人民对这个政策广泛地感到不满，差不多有一半的工党议员反对工党右翼领袖所维护的这种政策，这不是偶然的。就是在西德，社会民主党人考虑到群众的情绪，也继续反对主张不惜牺牲恢复德国统一而加速复活德国军国主义的阿登纳政策。这是可以理解的。复活德国军国主义的政策引起了欧洲各国合理的惊慌。
    完全有理由对这种政策提出一个问题：事情朝哪方面发展呢？走向巩固和平，还是走向新的战争？美国、英国、法国目前对德国问题的方针导向什么呢？
    这个方针导向建立某些欧洲国家的军事集团来反对另外一些欧洲国家。走这条路就是放弃巩固和平及欧洲安全。走这条路就是准备在欧洲发动另一次战争，结果导向第三次世界大战。
    法国、意大利、比利时以及和它们同伙的欧洲国家，为了安全的需要难道真的非走这条路不可吗？难道真的必须建立“欧洲防务集团”并同时使德国重新军国主义化，才能保障它们的安全与欧洲和平吗？
    近来，特别是在法国，不止一次地有人问道，有没有代替“欧洲防务集团”的东西？这就是说，用什么可以代替这个臭名远扬的“集团”。如果不建立以复活西德军国主义为基础的“欧洲军”，能不能保障和平与欧洲安全呢？虽然这些问题不止一次地被提出了来，但这样做的目的通常只是为了间接地替巴黎条约和波恩条约所规定的计划辩解。
    在柏林会议上，苏联针对建立某些欧洲国家的军事集团的计划，提出了一个具体的计划。根据这个计划，保障和平与欧洲各国的安全，就会有坚实的基础。这个计划就是苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案。
      “全欧条约”为防止侵略和防止破坏欧洲和平作出了相应的保证。欧洲的所有国家，无论它们的社会制度如何，都可以参加这一条约。在德国恢复统一以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国也可以参加这一条约，而到德国恢复统一之后，则由统一后的德国参加这一条约。
    这个条约规定，如遇任何一个缔约国遭到武装侵略时，其他缔约国应以一切可能的方式包括使用武装部队在内，对该国予以援助，以恢复和维持欧洲的国际和平与安全。
    同时，苏联的建议规定，在目前就应大大改善德国的处境，规定各国占领军自德国全境撤出，只留下数量上受到严格限制的部队。
    苏联的建议的目的是，建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系，以代替互相对立的欧洲某些国家组成的军事集团。
    从一九四七年起，就有了一个区域性的泛美互助条约，参加这一条约的有美国和拉丁美洲的所有国家。这样一种区域性的条约，如果仅仅是为了防御目的，是有其积极意义的，当然，不能认为美国统治集团借口抵抗共产主义而利用这一条约来获得自私的利益这样的企图是合法的。苏联代表团驳斥了对于“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的反对意见，指出这些直接反对区域性的欧洲条约的意见是站不住脚的。这样一个具有真正防御性质的条约完全符合于联合国宪章的原则。
    在柏林会议上，有人不止一次地提到，目前的世界是分裂的，现在存在着社会制度不同的国家。自然不能不考虑到这一事实，不能不考虑到：不但苏联，而且还有许多国家走上了社会主义和人民民主的道路，并正在沿着这条道路胜利地前进。
    我们认为这是二十世纪中最伟大的成就。我们不准备否认这样一个事实，即和平、民主、社会主义阵营现在团结着拥有八亿人口的若干国家。这一民主阵营的力量的增长是很明显的，的确在许多方面是真正值得引为教训的。
    但是，我们始终一贯地坚持着列宁关于不同社会制度的国家可以共处的原则。
    我们认为，例如在欧洲，尽管存在着各种不同的社会制度，欧洲各国的人民都是关心保障和巩固和平的。我们希望，在保卫和平的问题上，无论在欧洲和全世界都不分为两个阵营。我们呼吁所有欧洲国家拒绝建立互相对立的军事集团，因为建立这样的集团就不能不导致战争。我们建议，由凡是愿意保障它们的安全和巩固欧洲和平的欧洲国家组成一个单一的阵营。
    在这个欧洲安全体系中，任何一个国家，即使是强大的国家，都不应当处于统治地位。所有参加这一集体安全体系的国家的主权都必须得到保证，不受外来的侵犯。“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案就是以上述原则为基础的。
    这个草案没有得到法国、英国和美国外长的支持。但是没有一个外长能够拒绝欧洲各国集体安全的主张。人民是理解这一主张的。这一主张获得了所有爱好和平的人们的同情。
    保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的主张将继续不断地深入到千百万人的心中，将最可靠地促进欧洲以及世界的和平与安全的事业。苏联主张在对德和约未缔结之前，不允许建立德国军队，也就是说在这个时期内使德国保持中立。
    自然，某些部长们还可能要继续制订出各种计划，来建立“欧洲防务集团”，来使西德重新军国主义化。但是，这除了产生一个得不到人民支持的、不可靠的军事集团外，是不会得到什么别的结果的。另外一种情形就是欧洲各国集体安全的主张，这种主张体现为全欧条约，或者也可以是其他的形式。欧洲各国人民同情这个主张的越来越多，因为这个主张表达了他们对于巩固和平及建立普遍安全的衷心愿望。
    苏联政府从来不隐瞒自己反对那个表现出美英集团称霸世界的意图的北大西洋公约。建立“欧洲防务集团”，从而直接促使德国军国主义复活的企图，在许多方面加深了存在的分歧。苏联政府反对这种分歧被加深。我们致力于根据巩固和平的利益来解决争端。在目前这个事例中特别明显的是，苏联表达了欧洲（而且不仅是欧洲）一切爱好和平的人民的感情和思想。
    柏林会议上关于德国问题的讨论证明，苏联和西方三国的分歧首先存在于德国军国主义的问题上，因为现在有人在策划复活德国军国主义。苏联既然曾经在反对希特勒侵略的斗争中承担了主要重担，因此，它对德国军国主义一旦复活后所产生的新侵略危险不能不予以足够的估计。
    日益增长的西德重新军国主义化的威胁对奥地利问题不能没有影响。
    在柏林会议上，美国、英国、法国表示愿意撤回它们对对奥和约草案一些条款的反对意见，这些条款在过去五年中它们是一直反对的。这就足以说明，它们过去的反对意见是多么没有根据。
    苏联方面曾经在柏林会议上表示，如果苏联所提出的由于建立“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约的签订，因而成为必需的两项建议被通过，它就准备立即签订对奥和约。
    这两项建议就是：
    第一，我们建议，奥地利应保证不参加任何旨在反对任何曾经派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的军事集团。奥地利也不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地；
    第二，我们主张，在对奥和约中列入一条：鉴于对德和约签订的拖延，目前驻扎在奥地利境内的四个外国的军队可以继续留驻在那里，应在不迟于一九五五年的时间，重新研究四国军队撤出奥地利领土的期限问题。如果没有建立“欧洲军”的计划，这个附加的一条当然就没有必要了。这个附加的一条之所以必要，是因为美国和英国现在正在施加种种压力，要法国和其他国家同意复活西德军国主义，这样自然就加深了新的德奥合并的危险。
    美国、英国和法国政府不同意苏联对对奥和约提出这两项补充的建议。它们并且阻止奥地利政府以应有的理解来对待这些建议。结果，对奥和约没有能够签订。
    上列事实证明，对奥和约未能签订的责任应归于不愿放弃复活德国军国主义计划的美国、英国和法国政府，由于它们不愿放弃这个计划就加深了新的德奥合并的危险。
    目前，美国、英国、法国和奥地利的官方人士想把对奥和约没有签订归罪于苏联，这种企图是没有根据的。在目前的条件下，苏联政府不能不考虑到复活德国军国主义的危险和德奥合并的新的威胁，对奥和约中为了防止这种情形发生作了特别的规定。苏联表示，只要大家同意苏联上述两项既符合奥地利本国人民的利益、又符合和平及欧洲各国安全的利益的建议，苏联就准备签订对奥和约。
    （三）
    除了德国问题和奥地利问题外，柏林会议还讨论了第一项议程范围内的关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施的问题。讨论这个问题，无疑是有其重要意义的。
    柏林会议一共举行了二十七次会议。其中包括六次只有有限人员参加的秘密会议，在这些秘密会议上主要是讨论了与第一项议程有关的一些问题。
    经过这几次秘密会议的讨论，四国外长在二项决定上达成了协议。
    大家知道，四国外长达成了如下的协议：苏、美、法、英四国政府将促进顺利解决裁军问题，或至少是大量缩减军备问题。这一协议苏联代表团并不完全满意。因为这一协议没有反映出我们提出的关于在今年召开世界普遍裁减军备会议的建议。然而，这一协议使四国政府承担了一定的义务。这一协议的目的是反对扩充军备。这一协议责成四国政府至少要促进大量缩减军备，这是苏联始终坚持的主张。
    另外还达成了关于一九五四年四月二十六日在日内瓦召开一个会议的协议。在这次会议上，苏联、美国、法国、英国和中华人民共和国的代表，将在大韩民国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及其他有武装部队参加朝鲜战争并愿意参加会议的国家的参加下讨论和平解决朝鲜问题，并将在有关国家的参加下讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    因此，四月二十六日将在日内瓦召开的会议是一个由五大国参加的、讨论亚洲两个最紧急的问题——朝鲜问题和印度支那局势问题——的会议。这样，中华人民共和国将和其他几个大国一起在会议上占有它的合法地位。
    柏林会议所达成的这一协议的意义今天还无法充分加以估价。然而，这个协议会有助于解决亚洲两个重大的问题，从而将有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势。
    在解决朝鲜问题方面，联合国大会显得无能为力；在这问题上它也是在美国压力之下行事的。美国方面这种压力使联合国大会通过了错误的决定，阻挠了朝鲜政治会议的召开。参加板门店会谈的美国代表也是按这个目标行事的。
    柏林会议有助于解决这个难题。现在，苏联、中华人民共和国、美国、英国和法国的代表与朝鲜两部分的代表一起，将能来共同研究如何最后解决朝鲜问题。任务是帮助朝鲜在民主的基础上恢复国家统一，并使朝鲜从停战转入持久和平。
    在柏林会议上，法国代表对印度支那问题特别注意。在那里，法国的殖民政策已陷于绝境，遭到了保卫自身和平与民族自由权利的越南人民的英勇反抗。这个政策还给法国人民带来了难以忍受的负担，叫他们不断地付出无谓牺牲。
    日内瓦会议将面临着复杂的任务——保证恢复印度支那和平与印度支那人民的民族权利。这里，任务能否完成，在很大程度上决定于法国政府的态度，也决定于现在愈来愈加紧干涉印度支那事务的美国的态度。而主要是决定于会议的所有参加者是否承认必须不靠继续进行那毫无希望的战争的办法，而是靠达成符合各国人民自由和民族独立原则的协议的办法，来解决恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    现在，人们在广泛地讨论柏林会议的结果。在许多国家里，官方发言人和不同倾向的报纸都就这个问题发表意见。
    最近，法国外交部长谈到柏林会议的意义，特别是谈到了关于在日内瓦召开另一个会议讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的协议的重要性。事情的发展说明，解决这个问题已是多么迫切的事。
    英国外交大臣上星期在下院发表的演说中，对柏林会议提出了好些批评性的意见，然而同时他也承认这个会议完全是适合时宜的。他又说，毫无疑问，会议没有加剧国际紧张局势。他的发言流露出某些因对苏联施加压力的企图没有成功而产生的不满。
    大家也都知道，在美国，某些参议员批评杜勒斯，特别是他们认为杜勒斯在对中国的问题上表现得过分软弱。这些参议员留恋过去，他们恨不得伟大的中国人民仍然处于半殖民地国家的地位，受外国资本的无情剥削。然而，这样的时代是永远过去了。让我们希望这些参议员也能了解到这一点吧。
    根据以上所说各点，我们可以做出一些肯定的结论。
    当然，不应该过高估计柏林会议的结果。尤其是因为柏林会议的结果如何，事实上只能根据会议上所同意召开的日内瓦会议的结果才能加以判断。
    不过，我们不能不考虑这样一个事实，就是大国会议长期中断达五年之久的情况，现在已经结束了。柏林会议已经举行过了。这个会议有助于澄清几个国际问题，并铺平了美国、英国、法国、苏联和中华人民共和国代表与其他国家代表举行会议的道路。
    苏联政府所采取的措施的目的在于缓和国际紧张局势，也就是在于巩固和平。事实说明，这些措施并不是没有成果的。
    一切都说明，苏联政府所奉行的政策有助于巩固苏联以及整个民主阵营的国际地位。
