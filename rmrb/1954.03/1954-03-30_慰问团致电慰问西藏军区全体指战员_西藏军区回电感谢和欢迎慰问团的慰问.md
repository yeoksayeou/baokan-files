Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 29th. The National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army sent a telegram on March 11th to all commanders and fighters of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to express their condolences. The telegram reads as follows: Dear Commanders and Fighters of the Tibet Military Region:

Now, the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army has gone to various parts of the country to express condolences. In addition to sending a sub-delegation to the Qamdo area to express condolences to the road-building troops, due to current transportation and other limitations, we were unable to personally go to the Lhasa area to express the deep concern and condolences of the people of the whole country to you.

Since your entry into Tibet, you have overcome various difficulties and guarded the border of the motherland with perseverance and a great spirit of unity among fraternal ethnic groups. You have diligently repaired roads and assisted the Tibetan people in developing their economy and culture, thereby strengthening the close unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples and between the military and the people. The people of the whole country express their infinite gratitude. Therefore, we extend our highest respect and cordial condolences to you.

Now our great motherland is gradually realizing the general line of the state during the transition period and building a socialist society. This is what the people of the whole country have longed for for many years, and it is also the goal that the heroic and lovable Chinese People's Liberation Army has been striving to achieve through bloodshed and sacrifice for more than 20 years, so it is worthy of our special celebration. However, our country is still surrounded by imperialism, and our enemies will never be reconciled to their failure, and will try every means to undermine our great socialist construction. Therefore, we cannot have the slightest slackening. We hope that all commanders and fighters of the Tibet Military Region will continue to strengthen vigilance, consolidate national defense, safeguard the security of the motherland, unite the Tibetan people to build Tibet for a long time, and strive to strengthen national defense and thoroughly realize the general line and general task of the state during the transition period.
National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, March 11, 1954

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 29th. The commanders and fighters of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army sent a telegram on March 20th to thank the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army. The telegram reads as follows: Dear Comrades of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army:

Entrusted by the people of the whole country, you have come to the Kangzang Plateau and sent a telegram to express your condolences to us, which is a great encouragement to all of our comrades. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and warm welcome to you. In the past few years since our army entered Tibet, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, including the Tibetan people, the central government's ethnic policies have achieved great success here. Although we have achieved some success in the specific implementation, there are still many shortcomings in our work. From the perspective of consolidating national defense and uniting the Tibetan people to jointly build Tibet's great cause, we have only fulfilled our preliminary responsibilities, and there are still greater and more arduous tasks waiting for us to continue to work hard to complete. Therefore, the condolences from the people of the whole country on the one hand make us feel the importance of our responsibilities, and on the other hand, further strengthen and encourage our determination and confidence to move forward.

Dear comrades, in the new historical period when the great motherland is gradually realizing the general line of the transition period and building a socialist society, let us make a solemn guarantee to you and to the people of the whole country: Under the brilliant light of the general line, we will faithfully implement Chairman Mao's instructions, complete the tasks entrusted to us by the people of the whole country, be vigilant at all times, consolidate national defense, strive to improve our military, political, and cultural level, move towards the regularization and modernization of the national defense army, actively participate in various construction undertakings in Tibet, correctly implement ethnic policies, closely unite with the Tibetan people, and work together with the Tibetan people to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.
        All Commanders and Fighters of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
                        March 20, 1954

    慰问团致电慰问西藏军区全体指战员
    西藏军区回电感谢和欢迎慰问团的慰问
    【新华社拉萨二十九日电】全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团在三月十一日致电人民解放军西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员表示慰问，电文如下：亲爱的西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员：
    现在全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团已分别到全国各地进行慰问，我们除已去一个分团到昌都一带慰问修路的部队外，因目前交通及其他条件所限，未能亲去拉萨地区向您们表达全国人民的深切关怀与慰问。
    你们自进藏以来，战胜了各种困难，以坚忍不拔团结兄弟民族的伟大精神，辛勤地守卫着祖国边防，日夜赶修公路，协助藏族人民发展经济和文化，从而加强了藏、汉族人民与军民的亲密团结，全国人民表示无限的感谢。为此，谨向您们致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    现在我们伟大的祖国正在逐步实现国家在过渡时期的总路线。建设社会主义社会，这是全国人民多年向往的事，也是英勇可爱的中国人民解放军二十多年来流血牺牲所要达到的目的，所以值得我们大家特别庆幸。但是，我们的国家还处在帝国主义的包围下，我们的敌人绝不会甘心自己的失败，更会千方百计地破坏我们伟大的社会主义建设事业。因此，我们不能有丝毫松懈。希望西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员同志们继续加强警戒，巩固国防，保卫祖国的安全，团结西藏人民长期建设西藏，为加强国防力量和彻底实现国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务而奋斗。全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团一九五四年三月十一日
    【新华社拉萨二十九日电】人民解放军西藏军区全体指挥员、战斗员在三月二十日致电感谢全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团，电文如下：亲爱的全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团同志们：
    你们受全国人民的委托，前来康藏高原，并来电慰问我们，这对我们全体同志是一个莫大的鼓舞，谨向你们致以衷心的感谢和热烈的欢迎。我军进藏几年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下和全国人民包括西藏人民在内的大力支援下，使中央的民族政策在这里获得伟大的成就。虽然在具体执行中获得了一些成绩，但是，我们工作上还存在有很多的缺点，从巩固国防，团结西藏人民共同建设西藏的伟大事业上看来，我们只是尽了初步的责任，还有更伟大、更艰巨的任务，有待我们继续去努力完成。因此，全国人民对我们的慰问一方面使我们感到我们责任的重大，另一方面也更加坚定和鼓舞了我们前进的决心和信心。
    亲爱的同志们，在伟大的祖国正在逐步地实现过渡时期的总路线，建设社会主义社会的新的历史时期，让我们向你们、向全国人民作庄严的保证：在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们一定忠实地执行毛主席的指示、完成全国人民对我们的委托，时刻提高警惕，巩固祖国国防，努力提高军事、政治、文化水平，向正规化现代化的国防军的方面迈进，积极地参加西藏各项建设事业，正确地执行民族政策，紧密地团结西藏人民，与藏族人民一道，为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而奋斗。
        中国人民解放军西藏军区全体指战员
                        一九五四年三月二十日
