The Tangshan Power Plant launched a patriotic labor competition last April and a campaign to increase production and practice economy in September. During the competition, the plant's Party organization significantly enhanced the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the workers through regular political and ideological work. This gradually transformed the competition into a regular form of labor for the workers, thereby ensuring the successful completion of the state plan. By the end of last November, the plant had comprehensively overfulfilled the state task for twenty-three consecutive months. As of the end of December, the turbine and boiler workshops had been operating safely for 1,244 days. Indicators such as power generation, coal consumption, and plant electricity usage all exceeded state quotas, creating substantial wealth for the state. Last year, the plant was honored with the titles of Model Factory of Hebei Province, Model Factory of North China, and Advanced Plant of the National Electricity Industry.

    Pushing Labor Competitions Towards Regularization

The labor competition at the Tangshan Power Plant last year differed from previous years. The main characteristic of last year's competition was the comprehensive mobilization of the masses. The competition was closely integrated with the completion of production tasks and the strengthening of enterprise management. This gradually transitioned the competition from a sporadic and somewhat blind initial stage to a more advanced stage of regularization. The Party organization resolved the following issues to ensure the regularization of labor competitions:

    First, strengthening centralized and unified leadership over the competition. Strengthening the Party's strong, centralized, and unified leadership over the competition is crucial for ensuring its healthy and sustainable development. In the past, the plant had organized competition committees, but they failed to leverage the organizational roles of various departments. As a result, the competition ended with the disbanding of the committee. At the beginning of last year's competition, the trade union independently organized mass competitions, leading to "solo efforts" by the union and causing the competition to become a mere formality. Later, after careful study, it was determined that the Party should exercise unified leadership, the trade union should provide specific organization, the administration should provide strong support, and the Communist Youth League should closely cooperate. This ensured that the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League had a common understanding, clear division of labor, and close cooperation, guaranteeing the healthy and sustained development of the competition.

During the competition, the Party organization used the method of strengthening political and ideological leadership to continuously attract all employees to participate in the competition. When the campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched in September, the Party organization, in addition to grasping the overall situation, focused on analyzing the ideological situation of the employees. It adopted the method of first educating Party members and then non-Party members, first cadres and then the masses, to comprehensively mobilize thought at all levels. It also mobilized Party members and propagandists to vigorously carry out publicity work on increasing production and practicing economy, quickly creating a surge in the campaign throughout the plant. During the competition, the Party organization strengthened its leadership over the work of the trade union and regularly supervised the administration and leadership of the Communist Youth League. As the competition developed, the trade union's role became increasingly important. It became the staff department for workshop and team competitions and the hub for the Party to promote mass competitions. The Party organization, through timely and planned inspections and summaries of the competition, through leading trade union cadres to study the experience of the "May 3rd" factories in Northeast China and the documents of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, and through convening employee representative meetings, trade union group meetings, and other means, mobilized the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up, boldly exposing the problems existing in the competition and their root causes. This further clarified the center and goal of the competition for trade union cadres, as well as the trade union's main responsibilities and methods for organizing the competition. The Party organization criticized the erroneous thinking of a few administrative cadres who believed that "competition is the trade union's business and has nothing to do with us," as well as the phenomenon of individual Communist Youth League cadres becoming detached from the competition and production, and engaging in isolated activities of the League, thereby correcting everyone's understanding and attitude towards the competition. Now, the administrative leaders of the plant and workshops are not only able to promptly propose production plans on a monthly and weekly basis, and hand them over to the trade union to organize mass discussions, but also provide strong support and assistance in technical guidance, labor allocation, evaluation and rewards, and the handling of employees' rationalization proposals. The League organization focuses on doing a good job in regular technical learning and consolidating education on labor discipline, in order to cultivate a communist labor attitude among young employees and continuously improve their technical skills.

    Second, overcoming the tendency of formalism in the competition. In the early stages of the competition, due to a lack of experience in regular labor competitions and an insufficient understanding of the competition's long-term nature, relatively serious formalism occurred. This was mainly manifested in: 1. The content of the competition was too complicated and impractical. For example, at the beginning of the competition, some teams included hygiene, playing ball, singing, and studying the Marriage Law as competition conditions, resulting in "everything being set but everything being forgotten." Shortly after the initial flurry of challenges and responses, the competition disappeared without a trace. 2. Mechanically recording and scoring points fostered a tendency towards championism among some people, causing many unnecessary disputes among employees. In addition, the judging time was too long (sometimes lasting five hours without results), causing dissatisfaction among the masses. 3. The organization of the competition also suffered from serious formalism, such as the simultaneous existence of competitions between shifts, workshops, and teams in the early stages, without any focus. During the evaluation and inspection in off-duty hours, shifts, workshops, and teams all proceeded simultaneously, creating chaos.

In response to the above situations, the plant's Party organization continuously inspected the progress of the competition, thereby discovering problems and finding ways to improve them. At the same time, it repeatedly and thoroughly conducted ideological education on the regularization of the competition among employees. In late July and early August of last year, the Party organization led various departments in conducting a more systematic inspection from top to bottom, and mobilized the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up. This inspired the masses to raise many opinions on the leadership, deeply exposing and criticizing the tendency of formalism in the competition and certain bureaucratic styles of leadership, as well as the negative attitude of some cadres who did not support or cooperate with the competition. At the same time, some practical and feasible methods and systems were established. After correcting the tendency of formalism in the competition, the Party organization led everyone in earnestly studying the experience of advanced factories and mines in the Soviet Union and Northeast China, and organized regular labor competitions by signing competition contracts. The signing of competition contracts ensured the regularization and collectivization of labor competitions and strengthened the planning of the competition. Participating workshops or teams were not only able to regularly grasp their own competition conditions, but also knew the competition conditions of other workshops or teams, further clarifying the significance and purpose of completing the competition conditions. The saying that "different businesses cannot compete" was no longer tenable.

    Third, mobilizing office personnel to participate in the competition. To regularize labor competitions, it is also very important to strengthen the political and ideological work of office personnel. In the past, due to insufficient attention to the work of office personnel, the competition in the offices had not been well developed for a long time. Some management personnel believed that "the stars follow the moon; any achievements in the competition also belong to the workshops." They lacked enthusiasm and confidence in the competition. This resulted in a situation where management lagged behind production and technical guidance could not keep up with the needs of production development. For example, the meters and gauges managed by the thermal laboratory were very inaccurate in the past. The laboratory could not promptly analyze the calorific value of coal, and the results of the competition could not be calculated in a timely manner. Sometimes the actual coal consumption was low, but after the analysis results came out, the standard coal consumption was calculated to be high, affecting the production morale of the masses.

After the start of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Party organization emphasized that effective measures must be taken to vigorously break through this weak link. It first started with inspecting work, mobilizing office personnel to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthening their political sense of responsibility. In late September, the Party Committee decided to assign a special person to be responsible for organizing forces, first in the Party and League organizations in the management departments, to carry out ideological mobilization, and then mobilizing all office personnel to inspect work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and seriously expose the problems existing in the work and their root causes. It also organized the solicitation of opinions from workshop workers on the work of the offices. According to the requirements of the workshops and the problems revealed, the Party organization once again conducted education on "facing the workshops, facing production, serving production" and combining scientific and technical knowledge with the labor experience of the workers. In the education, it focused on explaining that if management work is not improved, it may destroy the achievements of workers' active creation and increasing production and practicing economy. It also pointed out that the leading cadres of various departments in the management department should take the initiative to continue implementing various responsibility systems. It seriously criticized the conservative thinking of some management personnel who were perfunctory, methodical, and did not seek improvement, as well as the irresponsible phenomena such as "doing less is better than doing more" and shirking responsibility. This improved their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for the cause of the country, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible for work gradually decreased.

Secondly, on the basis of fully carrying out ideological mobilization, the trade union also organized various departments with relatively close business connections into groups by signing competition contracts. Each unit formulated work plans according to the actual situation and the requirements of the workshop work, actively invested in the competition to complete the central task of the plant, and made achievements in improving management. For example, the coal transportation department, which had always been considered the weakest link in management, formulated coal management methods in the competition, ensuring the timely supply of coal in terms of quantity and quality. The laboratory, coal transportation department, shift leader team, and relevant personnel of the boiler workshop formed a special coal blending team, which determined the proportion of coal mixing based on the heat content, fineness of the coal, and the load situation of the day, playing a significant role in ensuring safety and saving coal consumption.

    Ideological Education Work in Labor Competitions

Experience has proven that the development process of labor competition is a process of continuous criticism and self-criticism, using the advanced to drive the backward to achieve universal improvement, and also a process of continuously strengthening the new communist labor attitude and labor discipline, and gradually overcoming old and all non-working class thoughts and styles. During the competition, the Tangshan Power Plant Party organization grasped the following issues to carry out ideological education among employees, ensuring the healthy development of the competition.

    First, establishing and consolidating safety awareness. Electricity is the power of industry, and a power plant outage is an industrial disaster. Therefore, ensuring long-term safe power transmission is the primary task of all power plant employees. After repeated and thorough ideological education and vivid and powerful publicity and mobilization, as well as several mobilizations of employees to carry out safety production competitions and anti-accident struggles, most employees have basically established the concept of safe power transmission. By the end of last November, the turbine and boiler workshops had been operating safely for 1,213 days; some advanced teams of workers loudly proposed the slogan of "striving for 2,000 days of safe operation" on this basis. During the competition, the plant's Party organization grasped the following key aspects to conduct safety production education among employees: Constantly educating employees to consolidate safety production awareness and oppose complacency. Complacency in safety awareness is the main cause of accidents. The plant's Party organization grasped the law of employees' complacency and relaxation of safety awareness (such as the tendency to simply pursue savings figures and ignore safety in the competition, and the loss of vigilance after a certain period without accidents), and regularly used methods such as organizing everyone to study accident reports, holding safety picture exhibitions, issuing leaflets, and broadcasting propaganda to educate employees to consolidate their safety production awareness. At the beginning of last year's competition, the Party organization pointed out to everyone that "guaranteeing safe production is the biggest increase in production and conservation," explaining that the completion of the 200 billion yuan of wealth created by various factories and mines in Tangshan for the country depended on the power plant ensuring safe power transmission. On September 23, an accident occurred at a substation of the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau, and the power plant cut power to the Tangshan Steel Plant for one minute during line testing, causing the No. 1 converter of the steel plant to be blocked, resulting in a major loss of 180 million yuan. The power plant's Party organization organized employees to visit the steel plant that afternoon. Everyone was very sad to see the scene at the time, and said, "A one-minute power outage can cause such a big loss to the country!" After returning to the plant, each team organized discussions and meticulous accounting. This made everyone deeply realize the serious harm of power accidents to the country's economic construction, greatly enhancing the responsibility of employees to ensure long-term safe power generation.

Grasping typical events of violating safety rules in the plant to mobilize employees to conduct safety production thought inspections. On July 20 last year, Wang Zhanxing, a worker on duty in the electrical workshop, caused a major accident due to arrogance and improper operation, interrupting the entire workshop's safety record, causing some confusion: the workers in the maintenance team complained and blamed the operating workers; some operating workers lost confidence in ensuring safety, saying, "This time we have fallen, and we will not be able to get up!" At this time, the Party organization immediately organized forces to conduct in-depth inspection and summary of the course, causes, and hazards of the accident, and organized all employees of the plant to conduct discussions. In the discussion, many employees combined their own work and thoughts to conduct in-depth criticism and self-criticism, improving everyone's vigilance.

Conscientiously implementing technical operating procedures is the material foundation for ensuring long-term safety. Soviet experts who came to the plant to provide guidance once said: To ensure safety in the electricity industry, the first is regulations, and the second is still regulations. The plant's Party organization turned this sentence into a powerful slogan to promote the study and observance of operating procedures by employees, and continuously conducted ideological education on implementing regulations and systems and observing labor discipline among employees. Before each equipment overhaul, the plant organized employees to study overhaul procedures, quality standards, and safety operating procedures. In order to systematically improve the technical level of employees and lay a reliable foundation for safety production, the Party organization and the administration decided last year that June would be the month for studying regulations and systems, mobilizing employees to focus on studying the advanced experience of the Soviet "Technical Management Regulations for the Power Industry," and revising the plant's operating procedures in combination with the actual situation. The Party organization repeatedly publicized the great significance of this study, timely criticized the dogmatism of studying without linking to reality, and the complacency of thinking that "the articles have been memorized and there is no need to study them again," and implemented the principle of learning to apply. After the study, the employees' understanding of regulations and systems and technical level were significantly improved, and 183 people were promoted in the July worker assessment.

Doing a good job in publicity and education for equipment overhaul. In equipment overhaul work, the Party organization focused on implementing the spirit of quality first to ensure safety production. In view of the past situation in which employees emphasized speed and neglected quality, the Party organization proposed in the major overhaul work in May last year: "Complete the task on time on the basis of ensuring safety and ensuring quality." In equipment overhaul work, the Party organization unified the ideological understanding of ensuring overhaul quality and safety, and overcame the antagonistic emotions between the workshop maintenance personnel and the plant's acceptance personnel. For example, when a certain No. "Oil Switch" was inspected once, some workshop cadres emphasized that the prescribed time had arrived in order to avoid inspection, saying, "If you continue to inspect, and an accident occurs, it will be the responsibility of your acceptance!" As a result, a common accident was caused due to poor overhaul and lax acceptance. The Party branch of the workshop immediately seized this fact, expanded publicity, and emphasized that strict acceptance was precisely to ensure quality and safety, criticizing the ideological emotions of some employees who neglected quality. Through continuous publicity and education, the concept of "quality first" was established among employees, and the antagonistic emotions between maintenance personnel and acceptance personnel were overcome. In the past, workers said that the acceptance team was "looking for faults," but now they say: "It's better to look for them, ensuring safe production is also the glory of our workshop!"

    Second, overcoming capitalist thoughts in the competition. Comrade Kalinin pointed out in "On Communist Education" that cultivating the collective spirit of the working people and developing public habits in production and life is a basic content of communist education. The Tangshan Power Plant Party organization has always paid attention to this issue during the competition. Therefore, most employees of the plant have a relatively high level of socialist consciousness, and a new labor attitude has been more commonly established. However, due to the large increase in new workers, and due to the Party's poor political and ideological education of employees in the past, some quite serious non-working class thoughts and styles still exist among a few employees. For example, 1. Starting from departmentalism, deliberately leaving bad conditions for the next shift, and deliberately embarrassing the next shift, the three shifts do not trust each other and are not united, directly hindering safe production. 2. False phenomena. In September last year, individual ideologically backward workers used the means of secretly changing the "coal meter" to falsely report results in an attempt to obtain honors and rewards. At the end of the month, due to certain objective reasons, the production situation once became tense, and individual on-duty personnel made false copies when copying the meter in an attempt to conceal the false report. Although this was individual or a minority, its nature was extremely serious. The plant's Party organization treated these issues very seriously. The Party organization regarded strengthening the overall concept, opposing and overcoming capitalist thoughts in the competition, as the combat task of the Party's political and ideological work. Last year, during the competition, through publicity and education and carrying out the struggle against bad ideological tendencies, some capitalist thoughts in the competition have been basically cleared and overcome.

The Party organization emphasized doing a good job in the regular political education of employees in order to fundamentally improve the communist consciousness of employees. Since last year's competition, the plant has always insisted on a weekly (one hour each time) political class system; after October, according to the instructions of the higher Party committee, it was changed to once every two weeks, two hours each time. Most employees have developed the habit of attending political study on time. The main method of education is to have responsible cadres at the plant level make political reports and organize employees to discuss them. Education emphasizes linking to the actual situation of production and employees' thinking in order to achieve greater results. For example, in carrying out the education of "establishing an overall concept and promoting advanced thinking," it focused on further clarifying the ideological boundary between the collective spirit of the working class and the individualism of the bourgeoisie, criticizing departmentalism and individual fraudulent phenomena in the competition, so that employees deeply realized the harm of selfishness and championism to the collective cause, and strengthened the sense of responsibility of the masters. After the study, some employees boldly exposed some serious mistakes in their past work and expressed their determination to resolutely correct them.

Publicizing advanced figures and advanced thinking, and using the advanced to drive the backward, is an effective method to overcome departmentalism. Last year, in correcting the wrong thinking of leaving bad conditions for the next shift, the advanced thinking and advanced deeds of Liu Wu's team of "correcting oneself first, then correcting others" and leaving good conditions for the next shift were promoted through typical reports, organizing visits, group discussions, and convening symposiums of three shift leaders and main workers, educating the masses to conduct self-criticism, greatly strengthening the overall concept of employees, and the phenomenon of disunity among the three shifts was quickly overcome.

Severely criticizing the fraudulent phenomena of individual workers to educate themselves and warn everyone. For example, after discovering the false phenomenon of a certain on-duty personnel in the boiler workshop copying 1,000 fewer words on the meter at the end of September last year, the Party committee immediately conducted an investigation and research. After careful analysis, it first conducted a thought inspection against falsehoods in the boiler workshop, first within the Party and then outside the Party. Every employee linked to their own thoughts and actions to conduct in-depth criticism and self-criticism. Party Committee Secretary Suo Guoren also seriously exposed and criticized this fraudulent behavior at the plant-wide employee meeting.

    Third, promoting a humble and tenacious style. After the plant won the honorary titles of Model Factory of North China and Hebei Province and Advanced Plant of the National Electricity Industry last year, a few employees developed complacency and often said how our model factory was and boasted about their achievements in front of others. Some, although saying verbally that they should prevent complacency, thought in their minds that "the work is almost done," and could not see the shortcomings in their work, hindering the progress of the work. The plant's Party organization analyzed this situation, believing that it was a major obstacle to progress. From May last year, it often educated employees to promote a humble and tenacious style and oppose and overcome arrogant and complacent thoughts and emotions. The Party organization used the encouragement of the higher Party and the people's government to educate employees to strengthen the political sense of responsibility of the model factory. Last year, Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government and the Secretary of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out the direction of progress for the employees of the plant, calling on everyone to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, consolidate achievements, and continue to move forward. The plant's Party organization organized all cadres and employees to discuss these instructions; in October, the Party committee made overcoming arrogance and complacency one of the central contents of political work, and organized cadres and employees to conduct inspections in connection with their thoughts and work.

Since the competition last year, the plant's Party organization has also conducted socialist industrialization publicity and education for employees through various political education and the publicity of the general line, criticizing some conservative ideas and complacency of employees. It has enabled employees to further understand that increasing production and practicing economy is the fundamental method for our country to build socialism, and is the regular political task of every employee; to realize socialism as soon as possible, we must oppose complacency and conservative ideas, promote the spirit of hard work, and create and accumulate more wealth for the country, further inspiring the enthusiasm for the competition.

The Tangshan Power Plant Party organization's leadership of the competition has achieved considerable achievements and progress. However, there are still some problems in the work that should be paid attention to: some cadres and workers still have arrogance and complacency; the publicity of advanced figures and advanced thinking and the publicity and promotion of advanced experience are not systematic, timely, and prominent enough; although the political and ideological work of office personnel has been strengthened compared to the past, it is still not deep and thorough enough, and some management personnel have not been truly mobilized ideologically; the political work of auxiliary workshops is still quite weak, and the development of the competition is still uneven; there is still a lack of strong organizational work for employees' rationalization proposals, and some of them are still not handled in a timely manner; there is a lack of regular and specific leadership for the Party's propaganda network, which makes it impossible for some propagandists to play their due role in the competition. These are all issues that should be corrected and improved in the future.

    唐山发电厂党组织在劳动竞赛中的政治思想工作经验
    中共河北省委宣传部
    唐山发电厂去年四月开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛，九月份又开展了增产节约运动。在竞赛中，该厂党组织通过经常的政治思想工作，显著地提高了职工群众的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情，使竞赛日渐成为职工经常的劳动方式，从而保证了国家计划的胜利完成。到去年十一月底，全厂已连续二十三个月全面超额地完成了国家任务，至十二月底，汽机和锅炉车间安全运行已达一千二百四十四天；发电量、煤耗、厂用电等项指标都超过国家定额，给国家创造了大量的财富。去年该厂曾先后荣获河北省、华北区模范工厂和全国电业先进厂的光荣称号。
    把劳动竞赛推向经常化
    去年，唐山发电厂的劳动竞赛和历年来的竞赛不同。去年竞赛的主要特点是全面地发动了群众，把竞赛与完成生产任务和加强企业管理密切地结合了起来，使竞赛由突击的和带有一定盲目性的初级阶段，逐步地走上了经常化的高级阶段，党组织在保证劳动竞赛经常化方面解决了以下几个问题：
    第一、加强对竞赛的集中统一领导。加强党对竞赛的坚强的集中统一的领导，是使竞赛健全持续发展的关键。过去，该厂曾组织过竞赛委员会，结果由于不能发挥各部门的组织作用，以致随着竞赛委员会的结束，竞赛也就结束了。去年竞赛之初，该厂曾由工会单独组织群众竞赛，结果形成工会“单干”，使竞赛一度流于形式。后来，经过认真研究，才确定了党统一领导、工会具体组织、行政大力支持、团密切配合的领导方法。这样，党、行政、工会、青年团统一认识，明确分工，密切配合，保证了竞赛健全持久地发展。
    在竞赛过程中，党组织用加强政治思想领导的方法，经常地吸引全体职工参加到竞赛中来。去年九月开展增产节约竞赛时，党组织除了掌握全面的情况以外，着重分析了职工的思想情况，采取了先党内后党外、先干部后群众层层打通思想的方法，进行了广泛深入的思想动员，并发动党员和宣传员，大张旗鼓地展开了增产节约的宣传工作，使增产节约运动很快在全厂形成热潮。在竞赛过程中，党组织加强对工会工作的领导，并经常监督行政和领导青年团。随着竞赛的发展，厂的工会工作愈来愈显示了它的重要作用，工会组织成了车间和小组竞赛的参谋部，成了党推动群众竞赛的枢纽。该厂党组织及时地有计划地通过对竞赛的检查和总结，通过领导工会干部学习东北“五三”工厂经验与中国工会第七次全国代表大会文件，通过召开职工代表会、工会小组会等方式，发动群众开展了自下而上的批评与自我批评，大胆地揭发了竞赛中存在的问题及其根源。这就使工会干部进一步明确了竞赛的中心和目标，以及工会在竞赛中的主要责任，组织竞赛的办法。党组织曾批判了少数行政干部认为
  “竞赛是工会的事，与己无关”的错误思想，及个别青年团的干部脱离竞赛与生产，孤立地搞团的活动等现象，端正了大家对竞赛的认识和态度。现在，厂和车间的行政领导方面，不但能够按月按周及时地提出生产计划，交工会组织群众讨论，并且在技术指导、劳力调配、评判奖励及处理职工的合理化建议等方面，都能给以有力的支持和帮助，团的组织则着重搞好经常的技术学习和巩固劳动纪律的教育，以培养青年职工的共产主义劳动态度，不断提高青年职工的技术水平。
    第二、克服竞赛中的形式主义偏向。竞赛初期，由于大家对经常的劳动竞赛缺乏经验，对竞赛的长期性认识不足，曾发生过较严重的形式主义现象。主要表现在：一、竞赛内容过于繁杂，不切合实际。例如在竞赛开始时，有些小组把卫生、打球、唱歌、学婚姻法等都订为竞赛条件，结果是“订好了，忘完了。”轰轰烈烈地挑应战过后不久，竞赛就销声匿迹，若无其事了。二、机械地记分和评分，助长了某些人的锦标主义思想，引起职工中许多不应有的纠纷。加之评判的时间过长（有时一连评论五个钟头也没结果），引起群众不满。三、在竞赛的组织上也发生过严重的形式主义，如竞赛初期值与值、车间与车间、小组与小组的竞赛同时并存，没有重点；在业余时间进行评判检查时，值、车间、小组同时进行，乱作一团。
    针对以上情况，该厂党组织不断地检查竞赛开展的情况，从而发现问题，找出改进办法，同时对职工反复深入地进行竞赛经常化的思想教育。去年七月底八月初，党组织领导各部门进行了一次较系统的自上而下的检查，并发动群众开展了自下而上的批评与自我批评，启发群众对领导上提出了很多意见，深入地揭发与批判了竞赛中的形式主义偏向和领导上的某些官僚主义作风，以及某些干部不支持、不配合竞赛的消极态度。同时，确立了一些切实可行的方法与制度；在纠正了竞赛中的形式主义偏向以后，党组织又领导大家认真地学习了苏联及东北先进厂矿竞赛的经验，用签订竞赛合同的方法，把经常的劳动竞赛组织起来了。竞赛合同的签订，保证了劳动竞赛的经常化和集体化，加强了竞赛的计划性，参加竞赛的车间或小组，不但能够经常掌握住自己的竞赛条件，并且也知道了别的车间或小组的竞赛条件，进一步明确了完成竞赛条件的意义和目的。“业务不同不能竞赛”的说法站不住脚了。
    第三、发动科室人员投入竞赛。要把劳动竞赛经常化，加强对科室人员的政治思想工作也是很重要的。过去，由于对科室人员的工作不够重视，致使科室中的竞赛长时期没有很好的开展起来。部分管理人员认为：“星星跟着月亮跑；竞赛有了成绩也是车间的。”对竞赛缺乏热情和信心。这样就造成管理落后于生产，技术指导赶不上生产发展的需要的情况。如过去热力试验室所管理的表计很不准确；化验室不能及时化验出煤的发热量，竞赛结果不能及时地计算出来。有时实际煤耗低了，但等化验结果出来一计算，标准煤耗却高了，影响了群众的生产情绪。
    增产节约竞赛开始后，党组织强调提出，必须采取有效措施大力突破这一薄弱环节。首先从检查工作入手，发动科室人员开展批评与自我批评，加强他们的政治责任感。九月下旬，党委确定由专人负责，组织力量，首先在管理部门的党、团组织中进行了思想动员，然后发动全体科室人员检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，认真地揭发了工作中存在的问题及其根源，并有组织的征求了车间工人对科室工作的意见。根据车间要求和揭发出来的问题，党组织再次向大家进行了“面向车间、面向生产、为生产服务”和把科学技术知识与工人的劳动经验相结合的教育。在教育中，着重说明管理工作不改进，将可能破坏工人积极创造与增产节约的成果等道理；并指出：管理部门各股的领导干部应该亲自动手，继续贯彻各种责任制度。严肃地批判了某些管理人员中例行公事、按步就班、不求改进的保守思想，以及“多一事不如少一事”，推委搪塞等不负责的现象。这样，提高了他们对国家事业的责任感和积极性，工作上无人负责的现象就日渐减少。
    其次在充分进行思想发动的基础上，工会又用签订竞赛合同的方式，把在业务上联系比较密切的各个部门分组组织起来。各单位根据实际情况和车间工作的要求，分别制订了工作计划，为完成全厂的中心任务积极地投入了竞赛，在改进管理上作出了成绩。如过去一向被认为是管理最薄弱的运煤股，在竞赛中拟定了燃煤管理办法，保证了燃煤在数量上和质量上都能及时供应。化验室、运煤股、值长组和锅炉车间有关人员组成了专门的配煤小组，每天根据煤的含热量、细度及当日的负荷情况确定掺煤的比例，对保证安全和节省煤耗起到了很大的作用。
    劳动竞赛中的思想教育工作
    经验证明，劳动竞赛的发展过程，是不断进行批评与自我批评，以先进带动落后达到普遍提高的过程，也就是新的共产主义的劳动态度和劳动纪律日益加强，旧的及一切非工人阶级的思想和作风逐渐被克服的过程。唐山发电厂党组织在竞赛过程中，抓紧了以下几个问题对职工进行思想教育，保证竞赛健康的发展。
    第一、树立巩固的安全思想。电是工业的动力，电厂停电就是工业的灾害。因此，保证长期安全发送电，是电厂全体职工的首要任务。唐山发电厂经过反复深入的思想教育和生动有力的宣传鼓动，及几次发动职工开展安全生产竞赛和反事故斗争，大多数职工已经基本上树立了安全发送电的思想。到去年十一月底，汽机和锅炉车间安全运行已达一千二百一十三天；一些先进小组的工人，在此基础上又响亮地提出“争取安全运行两千天”的口号。在竞赛的过程中，该厂党组织抓住了以下几个环节。对职工进行安全生产教育：经常教育职工巩固安全生产思想，反对松懈。安全思想松懈，是造成事故的主要根源。该厂党组织掌握了职工产生麻痹自满情绪和安全思想松懈的规律（如在竞赛中往往发生单纯追逐节约数字忽视安全的思想，在一定时期未出事故即失去警惕等），经常用组织大家学习事故通报，举办安全图片展览，印发传单及广播宣传等办法教育职工巩固安全生产思想。在去年竞赛开始时，党组织就向大家指出“保证安全生产就是最大的增产节约”，说明全唐山市各厂矿给国家增产节约两千亿元的财富，必须电厂保证安全发送电才能完成。九月二十三日，唐山电业局某变电站发生事故，电厂在试线时给唐山钢厂停电一分钟，使钢厂某号转炉堵了风眼，造成一亿八千万元的重大损失。电厂党组织当天下午就组织职工到钢厂去访问。大家看到当时的情景十分难过，纷纷说：“停一分钟的电就给国家造成这么大的损失呀！”回厂后各小组又组织了讨论和算细账。这样，使大家都深刻地体会到电业的事故对国家经济建设的严重危害，大大增强了职工保证长期安全发电的责任感。
    抓住本厂违反安全制度的典型事件，发动职工进行安全生产思想检查。去年七月二十日，电气车间值班工王占兴，因骄傲自满操作不当造成一次重要事故，中断了整个车间的安全记录，引起某些混乱思想：检修班的工人埋怨责备运行工人；有的运行工人对保证安全失掉信心，说：“这回跌倒可就爬不起来了！”这时，党组织立即组织力量，对发生事故的经过、原因及造成的危害等，进行了深入的检查和总结，并组织全厂职工展开了讨论。讨论中不少职工联系自己的工作和思想，进行了深刻的批评与自我批评，提高了大家的警惕。
    认真贯彻技术操作规程，是保证长期安全的物质基础。来厂指导工作的苏联专家曾说过：在电业中保证安全，第一是规程，第二还是规程。该厂党组织把这句话变成了推动职工学习与遵守操作规程的有力口号，不断地向职工进行了执行规程制度和遵守劳动纪律的思想教育。每次设备检修前，该厂都组织职工学习检修规程、质量标准和安全工作规程。为把职工技术水平较系统地提高一步，为安全生产打下可靠的基础，去年党组织和行政确定六月份为规程制度学习月，发动职工集中地学习了苏联“电力工业技术管理法规”先进经验，并结合修订了本厂的操作规程。党组织反复宣传了这一学习的重大意义，及时地批判了学习不联系实际的教条主义，及认为“条文已经背熟了，用不着再学习了”的自满情绪，贯彻了学以致用的方针。经过学习显著地提高了职工对规程制度的认识和技术水平，七月份考工晋级时有一百八十三人升了级。
    作好设备检修的宣传教育工作。在设备检修工作中，党组织着重贯彻了质量第一保证安全生产的精神。鉴于过去职工们强调快速忽视质量的情况，在去年五月大检修工作中，党组织即提出：“在保证安全、保证质量的基础上按时完成任务。”在设备检修工作中，党组织统一了对保证检修质量和安全的思想认识，克服了车间检修人员和厂的验收人员之间的对立情绪。如一次验收某号“油开关”时，有的车间干部为躲避验收强调到了规定时间，说：“再验下去，造成事故，算你们验收的事！”结果，因为检修不良、验收不严造成一次普通事故。该车间党支部随即抓住这一事实，扩大宣传，强调说明严格验收正是为了保证质量和安全，批判了部分职工忽视质量的思想情绪。经过不断地宣传教育，在职工中树立了“质量第一”的观念，克服了检修人员与验收人员对立的思想情绪。过去工人说验收组是“找岔的”，现在说：“还是找找好，保证了安全生产也是咱们车间的光荣！”
    第二、克服竞赛中的资本主义思想。加里宁同志在“论共产主义教育”一书中曾指出：在生产中和生活上，培养劳动人民的集体精神，养成公共习惯，是共产主义教育的一项基本内容。唐山发电厂党组织在竞赛中经常注意了这方面的问题，因此，该厂大多数职工的社会主义觉悟是较高的，新的劳动态度已经较普遍地树立起来了。但是，由于新工人大量增加，由于过去党对职工的政治思想教育较差，在少数职工中仍存在着一些相当严重的非工人阶级思想和作风。比如，一、从本位主义出发，上班故意给下班留坏条件，下班也故意给上班找难堪，三班之间互不信任，互不团结，直接妨碍了安全生产。二、虚假现象。去年九月间，个别思想落后的工人，曾用暗中变动“煤表”的手段，谎报成绩，企图骗取荣誉和奖励。当月月底由于某些客观原因，生产情况一度呈现紧张，个别值班人员抄表时做假，企图隐瞒假报。这虽是个别或少数，但它的性质却是极其严重的。该厂党组织十分严肃地对待这些问题，党组织把加强整体观念、反对和克服竞赛中的资本主义思想，看作是党的政治思想工作的战斗任务。去年竞赛过程中，经过宣传教育和开展反不良思想倾向的斗争，竞赛中的某些资本主义思想基本上已被清算和克服。
    党组织强调搞好对职工经常的政治教育，以便从根本上提高职工的共产主义觉悟。自去年竞赛以来，该厂始终坚持每周一次（每次一小时）的政治课制度；十月以后根据上级党委指示改为每两周一次，每次两小时。大多数职工已经养成了按时参加政治学习的习惯。进行教育的主要方法是由厂级的负责干部作政治报告，并组织职工讨论。教育中强调联系生产和职工的思想实际，以便取得大的效果。如在进行“树立整体观念，发扬先进思想”的教育中，就着重进一步划清工人阶级集体主义与资产阶级个人主义的思想界限，批判了竞赛中的本位主义和个别人的作假现象，使职工深刻地认识到自私自利、锦标主义对集体事业的危害，加强了主人翁的责任感。经过学习有些职工大胆地揭发了过去工作中的某些严重的错误，并表示坚决改正。
    宣传先进人物先进思想，以先进带动落后，是克服本位主义的有效方法。去年在纠正上班给下班留坏条件的错误思想当中，通过典型报告、组织参观、小组讨论及召开三班班长、主要工人座谈会等方法，推广了刘武小组“先正己、后正人”，给下班留好条件的先进思想和先进事迹，教育群众进行了自我批评，大大加强了职工的整体观念，三班之间互不团结的现象很快被克服了。
    严厉批评个别工人的作假现象，以教育本人，警戒大家。如去年九月底发现锅炉车间某值班人员抄表时少抄一千个字的虚假现象后，党委立即进行了调查研究，经过慎重分析，首先在锅炉车间，先党内、后党外地进行了一次反虚假的思想检查，每个职工都联系自己的思想和行动，展开了深入的批评与自我批评。党委书记索国仁并在全厂职工大会上，严肃地揭发与批判了这种作假行为。
    第三、发扬谦虚坚韧的作风。去年，该厂荣获华北区和河北省模范工厂和全国电业先进厂的光荣称号以后，少数职工产生了自满情绪，常说我们模范厂如何，好在别人面前夸耀成绩。有的虽然在口头上说要防止自满，但在思想上却认为“工作搞的差不多了”，看不到工作中的缺点，阻碍了工作的进步。该厂党组织分析了这种情况，认为这是前进中一个很大障碍，从去年五月起，就经常教育职工发扬谦虚坚韧的作风，反对和克服骄傲自满的思想情绪。党组织用上级党和人民政府的勉励，教育职工加强模范厂的政治责任感。去年中央人民政府燃料工业部陈郁部长和中共唐山市委书记都曾给该厂职工指出前进方向，号召大家戒骄戒躁巩固成绩，继续前进。该厂党组织组织全体干部和职工对这些指示进行了讨论；十月份党委并把克服骄傲自满作为政治工作的中心内容之一，组织干部和职工联系思想和工作进行了检查。
    去年竞赛以来，该厂党组织还通过各种政治教育和总路线的宣传，大张旗鼓地对职工进行了社会主义工业化的宣传教育，批判了职工中的某些保守思想和自满情绪。使职工进一步了解到增产节约是我们国家建设社会主义的根本方法，是每个职工经常的政治任务；为早日实现社会主义必须反对自满情绪和保守思想，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，为国家创造和积累更多的财富，进一步启发了竞赛的热情。
    唐山发电厂党组织领导竞赛是有相当成绩和进步的。但是，工作中也还存在一些问题应该引起注意：有些干部和工人还存在着骄傲自满情绪；对于宣传先进人物、先进思想和宣传推广先进经验，作得还不够系统、及时和突出；科室人员的政治思想工作虽然比过去加强了，但还不深不透，有些管理人员还没有真正从思想上发动起来；辅助车间的政治工作还相当薄弱，竞赛的发展仍不平衡；对职工的合理化建议尚缺坚强的组织工作，有些处理的仍不够及时；对党的宣传网缺乏经常具体的领导，致使部分宣传员在竞赛中不能发挥应有的作用等。这些，都是今后应该加以纠正和改进的。
