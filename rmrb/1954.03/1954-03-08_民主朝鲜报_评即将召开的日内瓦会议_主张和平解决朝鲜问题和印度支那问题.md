Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 7th. "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 6th, supporting and welcoming the convening of the Geneva Conference.

The editorial stated: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at the invitation of the Soviet government, has agreed to participate in the Geneva Conference. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people fully support and welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference and expect that the Geneva Conference will bring positive results in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East. The Korean people are convinced that the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, like other international issues, must and can be resolved through peaceful consultation.

The editorial pointed out: The Korean people believe that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina are of great significance for consolidating peace and security in the Far East and the world. The Korean people are deeply concerned about the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The Korean people absolutely support President Ho Chi Minh's interview with the editor-in-chief of Sweden's "Expressen" on November 26 last year. The Korean people are convinced that it is possible to resolve the issue of restoring peace in Indochina through negotiations.

The editorial then pointed out: The agreement to convene the Geneva Conference, with the participation of the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, was unexpected by the US government. The achievement of this agreement is in fact the result of the Soviet Union's consistent efforts. Under the pressure of world public opinion that loves peace, and under the insistence of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Berlin Conference, the US, British, and French governments had no choice but to agree to convene the Geneva Conference with the participation of representatives from the five major powers, including the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other relevant countries.

The editorial then pointed out: Belligerent elements in the US ruling clique are spreading pessimistic sentiments about the prospects of the Geneva Conference and are still attempting to obstruct the easing of international tensions through negotiation. This requires the Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world to further heighten their vigilance. The Korean people clearly see that the US side has created a series of violations of the armistice agreement since the armistice was realized. The US side has brazenly trampled on the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," robbed more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; and recently, they have violated the provisions of Article 59 of the armistice agreement in an attempt to forcibly detain a large number of our displaced civilians. Therefore, the Korean people are paying close attention to the US side's attitude towards the Geneva Conference. Whether the Korean issue can be resolved at the Geneva Conference depends on whether the US side is sincere about peace.

The editorial pointed out: If the US side continues to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the upcoming Geneva Conference and does not abandon its conspiracy to continue to participate in the Indochina War, then it will be subjected to even more vehement condemnation from peace-loving people around the world, thereby falling into an even more difficult situation.

The editorial concluded: The Korean people are determined to further strengthen internationalist unity with the Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people around the world, and to work to ensure that the Geneva Conference contributes to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### “民主朝鲜报”评即将召开的日内瓦会议  主张和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题

    “民主朝鲜报”评即将召开的日内瓦会议
    主张和平解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题
    【新华社平壤七日电】“民主朝鲜报”六日发表社论，支持和欢迎日内瓦会议的召开。
    社论写道：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府应苏联政府的邀请，已经同意参加日内瓦会议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民完全支持和欢迎日内瓦会议的召开，并期望日内瓦会议在和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和远东紧张局势方面会带来肯定的结果。朝鲜人民确信，朝鲜问题和在印度支那恢复和平问题，与其他国际问题一样，是必须同时也能够通过和平协商来解决的。
    社论指出：朝鲜人民认为朝鲜问题的和平解决与在印度支那恢复和平，对巩固远东及全世界的和平与安全有重大的意义。朝鲜人民对恢复印度支那的和平问题怀着深切的关心。去年十一月二十六日胡志明主席对瑞典“快报”主编发表的谈话，受到朝鲜人民的绝对支持。朝鲜人民确信，通过会谈解决在印度支那恢复和平的问题是可能的。
    社论接着指出：对召开包括有中华人民共和国在内的五大国及其他有关国家参加的日内瓦会议达成了协议，是美国政府所未预料到的。这个协议的达成实际上是苏联始终如一地努力的结果。在全世界爱好和平人民的舆论压力下，及在柏林会议上苏联外交部长莫洛托夫坚持主张下，美、英、法政府才不得不同意召开包括有中华人民共和国在内的五大国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国及其他有关国家代表参加的日内瓦会议。
    社论接着指出：美国统治集团中的好战分子正在对日内瓦会议的前途散布悲观空气，仍企图阻挠用协商方法缓和国际紧张局势。这要求朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民进一步提高警惕。朝鲜人民清楚地看到，美方在停战实现以后制造了一系列的违反停战协定的事件。美方蛮横地蹂躏了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，劫夺了两万多名朝中战俘；最近他们又破坏停战协定第五十九款的规定，企图大量强迫扣留我方失所平民。因此，朝鲜人民十分注意美方对日内瓦会议的态度。朝鲜问题能否在日内瓦会议上得到解决，要看美方对和平有没有诚意。
    社论指出：如果美方在将要召开的日内瓦会议上仍然阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题，和不放弃它要继续参与印度支那战争的阴谋的话，那么，它必将受到全世界爱好和平人民更加激烈的谴责，从而陷入更加困难的境地。
    社论最后说：朝鲜人民决心进一步加强与苏联、中国和全世界爱好和平人民的国际主义团结，为使日内瓦会议对于和平解决朝鲜问题有所贡献而努力。
