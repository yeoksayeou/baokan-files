Workers in the factories and mines of the Central People's Government Fuel Industry System have overfulfilled the state plan for February for most major products. Coal production reached 107.3%, an increase of 27.2% over the same period last year; electricity generation reached 103.3%, an increase of 22.2% over the same period last year; gasoline production reached 113.8%, an increase of 109.4% over the same period last year; kerosene production reached 110%, an increase of 260.6% over the same period last year; and diesel production reached 151.8%, an increase of 54.2% over the same period last year. Only crude oil, although increased by 50.1% over the same period last year, only fulfilled 97.9% of the state plan. The Northeast region overfulfilled the task, while the Northwest region only fulfilled 87.8% of the state plan. The crude oil operation plan of the Yumen Mining Bureau was lower than the state plan and did not complete its operation plan.

Through the study of the General Line, the socialist consciousness of all workers in the factories and mines has been further enhanced. Therefore, the attendance rate during this year's Spring Festival was relatively normal. For example, in the East China region, several mines reached an attendance rate of over 95% within two or three days after the Spring Festival. In the Hanqiao Mine of the Jiawang Mining Bureau, the attendance rate in the major mining faces was over 98% on the day before the Spring Festival holiday and on the day of resumption of work. This was unprecedented and is one of the important reasons for ensuring the overfulfillment of the production tasks in February. In addition, some factories and mines have launched a competition centered on safety, attendance, and overproduction, which has also played a significant role in ensuring the overfulfillment of tasks. Factories and mines utilized the Spring Festival holiday to inspect, install, and maintain machinery, equipment, and roadway projects, maintaining the production order of the mines, effectively ensuring normal production, and ensuring the fuel and power needed for the development of other industries.

In terms of safety, coal mines in the Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions have eliminated fatal accidents. Five out of six units in East China have had no casualties, and the vast majority of units in North China have also eliminated fatal accidents. In particular, in the Central South region, due to the development of the "regularization and mass movement of regulations" and the promotion and enrichment of planning management and operation plans, and the implementation of the factory director responsibility system, fatal and serious injuries, as well as other major accidents, were eliminated throughout the month, and general accidents and minor injuries were also reduced. The Xiangjiang Coal Mine has not had a minor injury accident in fifty days; the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has taken the technical operation part of the operation plan as the main content of regulation education and has strengthened the sound safety communication network, safety activity days, and meeting, reporting, and inspection systems, so that serious roof accidents have been reduced from 23.8% of the total accidents last year to 5.6%, and the compliance rate of shed pillars has reached 97%. However, the safety situation in the coal mines and power plants in the Northeast region and some coal mines in North China is still not good enough. In particular, the occurrence of some accidents is completely avoidable, which should be paid more attention to.

The Coal, Electricity, and Petroleum General Administration Bureaus have paid attention to the above-mentioned problems and have sent people to conduct in-depth research in order to strive for the comprehensive completion of the production tasks in March.

Xinhua News Agency: The Zhaogezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine has completed the fourth 500,000-ton safe coal production plan eight and a half days ahead of schedule. As of February 27, coal production exceeded the plan by 10.21%, the average efficiency of all mine workers increased by 8.19% compared with the plan, no deaths or serious injuries occurred, and minor injuries were reduced by 15.52% compared with the third 500,000-ton safe production campaign. So far, the Zhaogezhuang Mine has safely produced 2 million tons of coal without a single death, and the fifth 500,000-ton safe production campaign has continued to be launched.

The enthusiasm of the workers of the Zhaogezhuang Mine for attendance after the Spring Festival this year is very high, and the attendance rate quickly reached 93% after work started. From February 18 to 25, the entire mine also conducted a major safety production inspection, solving 2,438 safety production problems, and made a detailed analysis of the accidents that occurred. These have played an important role in the fourth 500,000-ton safe coal production.

    燃料工业系统各厂矿职工
    超额完成二月份主要产品生产计划
    中央人民政府燃料工业系统各项主要产品，绝大部分超额完成了二月份国家计划。计原煤完成了百分之一百零七点三，比去年同期增加了百分之二十七点二；发电量完成了百分之一百零三点三，比去年同期增加了百分之二十二点二；汽油完成了百分之一百一十三点八，比去年同期增加了百分之一百零九点四；煤油完成了百分之一百一十，比去年同期增加了百分之二百六十点六；柴油完成了百分之一百五十一点八，比去年同期增加了百分之五十四点二。唯原油虽比去年同期增加了百分之五十点一，但只完成国家计划的百分之九十七点九，其中东北区超额完成了任务，西北区只完成国家计划的百分之八十七点八。玉门矿务局的原油作业计划低于国家计划，也没有完成作业计划。
    各厂矿全体职工通过总路线学习，社会主义觉悟更加提高，因此今年春节出勤比较正常。例如华东区有几个矿在春节后两三天出勤率就达到百分之九十五以上，贾汪矿务局韩桥矿各大回采场子在春节放假前一天和复工那一天，出勤率都在百分之九十八以上。这是过去所没有过的现象，这也是保证二月份超额完成生产任务的重要原因之一。另外有的厂矿更以安全、保勤、超产为中心，展开了竞赛运动，这对保证超额完成任务也起了很大的作用。各厂矿利用了春节休假期间对机器设备与巷道工程进行了检修、安装与维护工作，保持了矿井的生产秩序，有效地保证了正常生产，保证了其他工矿发展所需要的燃料和动力。
    在安全方面，中南、西南、西北区各煤矿都消灭了死亡事故，华东六个单位中五个单位没有发生伤亡事故，华北绝大多数单位也都消灭了死亡事故。特别是中南区由于开展了“规程经常化、群众化运动”，同时推动和丰富了计划管理和作业计划，推行了厂长负责制，全月消灭了死亡和重伤以及其他重大事故，一般事故和轻伤也减少了。湘江煤矿五十天内没有发生轻伤事故；焦作矿务局把作业计划中有关技术操作部分作为规程教育的主要内容，并抓紧健全了安全通讯网、安全活动日和会议、汇报、检查等制度，使严重的顶板事故已由去年占总事故的百分之二十三点八降低到百分之五点六，棚柱合乎规格的也达百分之九十七。但是，东北区各煤矿、电厂及华北某些煤矿安全情况仍不够好，特别是有些事故的发生是完全可以避免的，这就更应引起注意。
    对于上述这些问题，煤、电、石油各专业管理总局已提起注意，并派人深入研究，以争取三月份全面完成生产任务。
    又讯：开滦煤矿赵各庄矿已提前八天半完成了第四个安全产煤五十万吨的计划。到二月二十七日止，煤的产量超过计划百分之十点二一，全矿职工平均效率比计划提高百分之八点一九，没有发生过一件死亡或重伤事故，轻伤事故比第三个五十万吨安全生产运动又减少了百分之十五点五二。至此，赵各庄矿安全产煤已达二百万吨而无一死亡，第五个五十万吨安全生产运动已经继续展开。
    赵各庄矿职工今年春节后的出勤热情很高，开工后的出勤率很快达到百分之九十三。二月十八日到二十五日，全矿并进行了安全生产大检查，解决了有关安全生产问题两千四百三十八件，并对所发生的事故作了细致分析。这些对第四个五十万吨安全产煤都起了重要的作用。　　　（新华社）
