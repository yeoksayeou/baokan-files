Cooperatives and United Cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province Prepare a Large Number of Production Materials in Advance to Supply Farmers' Needs in a Timely Manner

According to the needs of farmers, cooperatives and united cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have prepared a large number of production materials in advance and are now actively allocating them to supply farmers in a timely manner. In general, counties began preparing production materials two to three months earlier than last year; the variety of production materials managed generally increased by about 20% to 40%; the planned business volume also expanded compared to last year. For example, the planned business volume of Zhaodong County in the first quarter of last year was 1.96 billion yuan, while it is 3.36 billion yuan in the first quarter of this year. Due to early preparation and advance commissioning of processing and ordering from handicraftsmen, counties have generally fully grasped the supply of goods according to plan. According to statistics from 35 counties in January, there were 138 kinds of production materials already in hand; among them, the original plan was to supply more than 12 million catties of manure in the first quarter, and more than 14 million catties have already been secured; for ploughshares, the plan was to supply more than 236,000, and more than 239,000 have already been secured. Zhaodong and other counties have also begun to organize handicraft processing and production of summer hoeing and some autumn harvesting farm tools.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, cooperatives and united cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have begun to investigate the needs of farmers for production materials, and have taken samples of farm tools to the countryside to ask farmers to identify specifications and quality. The Anda County Cooperative United Society organized old farmers to appraise 31 kinds of farm tools. Farmers made improvement suggestions on 23 kinds. When asking farmers to appraise ploughshares, they also brought two ploughshares from the neighboring Qinggang and Zhaozhou counties. After the farmers gave their opinions together, they learned from each other's strengths and overcame the shortcomings of poor style and poor quality by improving the manufacturing method of the ploughshares. According to the needs of farmers, the Nehe County Cooperative United Society has revised the production materials supply plan three times, basically overcoming the blindness of the plan. For example, their original plan was to supply 22,000 hoe blades, which has now been revised to 29,000; the original plan was to supply 100 rubber-tired carts, which has now been revised to 40.

While vigorously organizing the supply of goods, cooperatives and united cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province are actively trying to allocate the prepared production materials to grassroots cooperatives. The methods they adopted are mainly: (1) printing and distributing commodity catalogs, organizing grassroots cooperatives to check inventory, and actively purchasing goods; (2) delivering goods to grassroots cooperatives; (3) holding production materials ordering meetings for village cooperative directors and purchasing agents, organizing them to visit samples, and placing orders. Some county cooperative united societies have also organized material exchange meetings to allow production materials to directly meet the masses. An exchange meeting organized by the Kaitong County Cooperative United Society in Sijingzi Village had a transaction volume of more than 80 million yuan. As of February 10, the production materials allocated by Kaitong County to grassroots cooperatives have reached 67.3% of the planned supply for the first quarter. As of the end of January, the production materials supplied to farmers by counties outside the Heihe Special District accounted for 45.7% of the supply plan for the first quarter, an increase of 61.1% over the same period last year.

    黑龙江省各县合作社
    联合社提前准备大批生产资料及时供应农民需要
    黑龙江省各县合作社联合社根据农民需要，提前准备了大批生产资料，现正积极下拨，及时供应给农民。各县着手准备生产资料，一般都比去年提前两个月到三个月；经营生产资料的品种，一般增加百分之二十到四十左右；计划经营额也比去年扩大，肇东县去年第一季度计划经营额为十九亿六千万元，今年第一季度为三十三亿六千万元。由于及早进行准备，提前向手工业委托加工、订货，各县一般都已按计划充分掌握了货源。据三十五个县在一月份的统计，已掌握货源的生产资料有一百三十八种；其中大粪第一季度原计划供应一千二百多万斤，已经掌握的有一千四百多万斤；铧子，计划供应二十三万六千多个，已经掌握的有二十三万九千多个。肇东等县并已开始组织手工业加工生产夏锄及部分秋收农具。
    从去年第四季度起，黑龙江省各县合作社联合社即开始调查农民对生产资料的需要，并携带农具样品下乡请农民鉴定规格、质量。安达县合作社联合社组织老农鉴定了三十一种农具，农民对二十三种提出了改进意见，在请农民鉴定铧子时，他们还从邻近的青冈、肇州两县拿来两个铧子，经农民一并提意见后，取长补短，改进铧子的制造方法，克服了样式不好、质量次的缺点。讷河县合作社联合社根据调查农民需要的情况，把生产资料供应计划修改了三次，基本上克服了计划的盲目性。如他们原计划供应锄板二万二千块，现修改为二万九千块；原计划供应胶皮大车一百台，现修改为四十台。
    黑龙江省各县合作社联合社在大力组织货源的同时，积极设法将备妥的生产资料下拨给基层合作社。他们采用的办法主要是：（一）印发商品目录，组织基层合作社检查库存，积极进货；（二）送货到基层合作社；（三）召开村合作社主任、采买员参加的生产资料订货会，组织他们参观样品，进行订货。有的县合作社联合社还组织物资交流会，使生产资料直接和群众见面。开通县合作社联合社在四井子村组织的一次交流会，交易额达八千多万元。截至二月十日止，开通县下拨到基层合作社的生产资料，已达第一季度计划供应数量的百分之六十七点三。截至一月底，黑河专区以外各县供应给农民的生产资料，占第一季度供应计划的百分之四十五点七，比去年同时期增加百分之六十一点一。　　（李世哲　傅立家）
