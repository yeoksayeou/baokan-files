    Heroes Guarding the "Roof of the World"
    Mao Xingzhong, Lü Yulin
    Recently, we interviewed Comrade An Zhiming, who had just returned from the Ali region of Tibet. He told us about the heroic troops guarding the "Roof of the World."
    This unit departed from Yutian, Xinjiang, in June 1951 and crossed the 7,625-meter-high Dongjunla Peak in the Gangdise Mountains to enter the Ali region. The air on the mountain was thin, making breathing difficult. Soldiers often unloaded saddles from dead horses and continued to move forward carrying their belongings. Some comrades lacked experience in marching on the plateau. They didn’t elevate their pillows when sleeping at night, and their faces would be swollen the next day. However, the people's heroic troops overcame all unimaginable difficulties, stepped on the summit of the Gangdise Mountains, and finally reached their destination—Ali.
    Ali is a region in Tibet, including four Dzongs (counties) and seven nomadic areas, with a population of about 30,000. It is a border defense stronghold of the motherland, bordering Kashmir to the west, India to the south, and Nepal to the southeast.
    The terrain here is high, with an average altitude of about 5,000 meters above sea level. In the Himalayas, Kunlun Mountains, and Gangdise Mountains, one can often see herds of wild yaks, wild horses, as well as yaks, wild sheep, yellow sheep, blue sheep, and big-headed sheep; there are also bears, leopards, otters, lynxes, and foxes. In Rutog County, the sky is filled with swans, geese, yellow ducks, snow chickens, and gray cranes. Many Tibetans come here to pick wild bird eggs and sell them in the market. There is also a large natural salt lake here, producing salt that can supply the people of the entire Ali region and a portion of the people of India, Nepal, and other countries. Various minerals are also deposited in this undeveloped new land.
    On the Ali Plateau, the climate is unpredictable. It is common to see wind, rain, and snow on the same day, as well as sunshine. In the coastal areas of the motherland, July and August are the hottest time of the year, but here it is a different picture. The temperature at night often drops to zero degrees Celsius.
    At the foot of the Himalayas, transportation is inconvenient and supplies are difficult to deliver. When grain supplies are insufficient, the soldiers dig wild vegetables, hunt wild yaks, wild horses, or wild sheep to fill their stomachs, and pick "earth money" to eat as food. The climate on the plateau is not good, and smoking is needed, but where do cigarettes come from? Comrades can only find some wild grass flowers and waste tea leaves from the Gobi Desert to smoke. When shoes are worn out, they are made into leather nests from wild horse and wild yak skin. Life is indeed hard, but everyone knows that hardship is only temporary. In order to defend the border of the motherland and help the minority peoples build a happy life, they are not afraid of any difficulties or hardships.
    When soldiers encounter difficulties, they use the care of the people of the motherland and the heroic deeds of the soldiers to encourage themselves. On the way to Tibet, a Uygur soldier lost his horse and fell behind the team, with only a gun, a box of matches, and dozens of bullets left. In the hundreds of miles of uninhabited Gobi Desert, when the dry food was gone, he went to hunt wild rabbits, wild yaks, and wild horses. When he caught wild animals, he burned wild animal dung to eat "barbecue"; sometimes he couldn't find wild animal dung, so he ate half-raw meat. When he couldn't catch wild animals, he went to the river to drink ice water to satisfy his hunger. At night, exhausted, he draped himself in wild yak skin and slept in the Gobi Desert. Eighteen days later, he finally found his team. This soldier's heroic deeds inspired every border guard, no matter how cold the weather, they always kept their guns with them, and patrolled every checkpoint day and night, guarding the border of the motherland.
    From January to May, and from September to December, ice and snow seal the Ali Plateau, transportation is cut off, and they cannot see newspapers and magazines from the mainland. They can only listen to news from various places on the radio. They jump for joy whenever they hear news of industrial construction in Northeast China and water conservancy construction on the Huai River and Jing River. A soldier from Sichuan heard the news of the full opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the radio, and a smile immediately appeared on his face.
    The troops planted hundreds of acres of highland barley and peas in the past two years, and the harvest exceeded the local average yield by more than ten times. This good news quickly spread everywhere, and Tibetan compatriots rode donkeys and camels from hundreds of miles away to visit the troops'驻地。
    In the past, the people of Ali had never eaten vegetables, nor had they seen vegetables. The soldiers scattered the vegetable seeds brought from Xinjiang on the Ali Plateau, and Chinese cabbage, spinach, turnips, and radishes grew. In 1953, Tibetans also began to grow vegetables.
    During the slack season, the soldiers automatically helped the villagers harvest highland barley, repair ditches, build bridges, build houses, and deliver water; during the New Year and festivals, they also invited the villagers to eat and hold parties. In the winter of the year before last, an elderly Tibetan woman passed by the Gobi Desert, and was so hungry that she could not move. She was about to die. After a herding soldier discovered her, he felt his pockets and found no dry food, so he immediately slaughtered a sheep, cooked it for her to eat, and saved her life. This matter spread throughout Ali.
    The people of Ali love the People's Liberation Army as they love their own children. If soldiers get lost, the Tibetans help send them back; if the unit's cattle, horses, and sheep get lost, they will try to find them even hundreds of miles away. In Pulan County, on the banks of the Kongque River, a twelve-year-old Tibetan girl saw that the team was about to move, and she tightly held the soldier's hand, crying and refusing to let him leave. The little girl said:
   "Don't leave, if there is no firewood, I will help you collect firewood."
    The people's soldiers on the border line call themselves the eyes of the motherland and the sentinels of peace. They vigilantly defend our borders and protect the hardworking Tibetan people.

### 守卫在“世界屋脊”上的英雄们

    守卫在“世界屋脊”上的英雄们
    毛兴中　吕毓麟
    最近，我们访问了刚从西藏阿里区回来的安志明同志，他告诉了我们一些关于守卫在“世界屋脊”上的英雄部队的情况。
    这支部队于一九五一年六月从新疆于阗出发，翻过冈底斯山七千六百二十五公尺的东君拉高峰进入阿里区。山上空气稀薄，呼吸困难，战士们常常从死马背上卸下鞍子，背着东西继续前进。有些同志因缺少在高原上行军的经验，晚上睡觉不垫高枕头，第二天面孔就浮肿起来。但人民的英雄部队，克服了一切出乎人们想像之外的困难，把冈底斯山顶踏在自己的脚下，终于到达了目的地——阿里。
    阿里是西藏的一个区域，包括四个宗（即县）、七个游牧区，约有三万人口，是祖国的边防要地。它西靠克什米尔，南接印度，东南与尼泊尔接壤。
    这里地势高峻，平均拔海五千公尺左右。在喜马拉雅山、昆仑山、冈底斯山中经常可以看到野牛群、野马群，以及犛牛、野羊、黄羊、青羊、大头羊；还有熊、豹、獭、猞猁、狐狸等。在日土宗，天空中飞满了天鹅、大雁、黄鸭、雪鸡和灰鹤，很多藏民来这里拾野禽蛋，拿到市上去卖。这里还有一个很大的天然盐池，产盐可供给阿里全区人民和印度、尼泊尔等国家的一部分人民食用。在这块未开发的新地上，还蕴藏着各种矿产。
    在阿里高原上，气候变化无常，往往在同一天内可以看到刮风、下雨、飘雪，也可以看到阳光。在祖国的沿海区，七、八月是一年中最热的时候，但在这里却是另一个景象，晚上的气温往往降至摄氏零度。
    在喜马拉雅山脚下，交通不便，运输困难，粮食接济不上，战士们便挖野菜，打野牛、野马或野羊充饥，拾“地钱”当饭吃。高原上气候不好，需要吸烟，但那里来的纸烟啊？同志们只能从戈壁滩上找一些野草花、废茶叶来抽。鞋子穿破了，用野马和野牛皮做成皮窝子穿。生活确实艰苦，但大家知道，艰苦只是暂时的。为了守卫祖国边疆，为了帮助少数民族人民建设幸福的生活，他们是不怕任何的困难、艰苦的。
    当战士遇到困难的时候，就拿祖国人民对自己的关怀、战士中的英雄事迹来鼓舞自己。在进军西藏的路上，一个维吾尔族战士因丢掉马掉了队，身上只剩下一杆枪、一盒火柴和几十颗子弹。在数百里渺无人烟的戈壁滩上，干粮吃完了，他就去打野兔、野牛、野马。打到野兽，燃着野兽粪来吃“烤肉”；有时找不到野兽粪，他就吃半生不熟的肉。打不到野兽时，就到河里喝冰水充饥。晚上，疲倦了，披着野牛皮，睡在戈壁滩上。十八天后，他终于找到自己的队伍。这个战士的英雄事迹，鼓舞着每一个边防战士，不管天气怎样寒冷，总是人不离枪，枪不离人，日夜巡视着每一个卡口，警卫着祖国的边疆。
    一月到五月，九月到十二月，冰雪密封了阿里高原，交通断绝了，看不到内地的报纸、杂志，他们只能从收音机中收听各地的消息。他们一听到东北工业建设和淮河、荆江水利建设的每一个消息，都高兴得跳起来。有一个四川籍的战士，从无线电收音机中听到了成渝铁路全线通车的消息，脸上立刻出现了笑容。
    部队在前年和去年种了千百亩的青稞和豌豆，收获量超过当地的平均产量十几倍。这个喜讯迅速地传遍各地，藏族同胞从数百里外骑着毛驴、骆驼赶到部队驻地参观。
    过去，阿里的人民从来没吃过蔬菜，也没见过蔬菜。战士们把新疆带去的菜籽，撒在阿里高原，生长起白菜、菠菜、蔓菁、萝卜。一九五三年，藏民也种起菜来了。
    农闲时节，战士们自动帮老乡收青稞，修水渠，架桥梁，盖房子，送水等；过年过节，还请老乡吃饭，举行联欢。前年冬天，有一个藏族老太婆，路过戈壁滩，饿得不能走动，眼看就要断气。一个放羊的战士发见以后，摸摸口袋没有干粮，便马上杀了一个羊，煮熟了给她吃，把她救活过来。这件事情传遍了阿里。
    阿里的人民爱护人民解放军，像爱护自己的儿女一样。战士迷了路，藏民就帮助把他送回来；部队的牛、马、羊走失了，即使在数百里路以外，他们会设法把它们找回来。在孔雀河畔的普兰宗地方，一个十二岁的藏族小姑娘，看到队伍要移防了，她便紧紧地拉着战士的手，哭着不让走。小姑娘说：
  “千万不要走，没有柴，我帮你们拾柴火。”
    在国境线上的人民战士，称自己为祖国的眼睛，和平的哨兵。他们警惕地保卫着我们的边疆，保卫着勤劳的西藏人民。
