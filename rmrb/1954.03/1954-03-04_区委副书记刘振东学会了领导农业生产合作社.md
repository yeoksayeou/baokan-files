    Deputy District Party Secretary Liu Zhendong Learns to Lead Agricultural Production Cooperatives
	Jiao Dianzhen
    Liu Zhendong, the Deputy Secretary of the Ninth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Suizhong County, Liaoxi Province, was originally unfamiliar with the work of agricultural production cooperatives, like all the other cadres in the district. However, through diligent study, he finally became a good cadre who could lead agricultural production cooperatives.

    In 1952, when Liu Zhendong was transferred to serve as the Deputy Secretary of the Ninth District Committee, he was very happy, but he felt burdened when he thought about the agricultural production cooperatives in the Ninth District. He thought: if the problems of the mutual aid teams cannot be solved, wouldn't it be even more difficult to lead the agricultural production cooperatives! But he also thought that as a communist, he should overcome all difficulties. When Liu Zhendong arrived in the Ninth District, he was still afraid of leading the work of agricultural production cooperatives at first. For example, once, when Liu Zhendong went to Sunjia Village, he was about to walk into Wangbaoshan Village when he suddenly remembered that the Liu Hongda Agricultural Production Cooperative was in this village. He thought to himself, "What if Liu Hongda asks me to help solve the problems in the cooperative? What should I do then?" So he detoured around Wangbaoshan Village.

    Soon, Liu Zhendong participated in leading the Party rectification work in the entire district. During the education on the two roads, the new and the old, some Party members recalled their past lives under the oppression of landlords and deeply examined their capitalist ideology of not leading mutual aid and cooperation, but only caring about personal wealth. Only then did Liu Zhendong realize that his responsibility was great. If he did not actively lead everyone to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, some people would take the road of capitalism. Liu Zhendong felt very ashamed when he thought about his previous fear of leading agricultural production cooperatives. Can a communist who does not actively lead farmers in running agricultural production cooperatives well be said to be striving for the cause of communism? He also thought of the county committee's instructions when he first came to the Ninth District: "The tasks in the Ninth District are very heavy, so we must work hard to lead the comrades in the entire district to do the work well!" At this time, Liu Zhendong felt very sad and couldn't help but blame himself: I am the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, if I am so afraid of difficulties, then what about the other comrades in the district? After thinking about it, he made up his mind to lead the cadres in the entire district to run the agricultural production cooperatives well.

    In 1952, although seven agricultural production cooperatives had been experimentally established in the Ninth District, they were all experimentally established by the county committee, and the district committee had not been involved in this work at all. Therefore, when the district committee began to experimentally establish agricultural production cooperatives in 1953, it had no experience. At the same time, the newly built eight agricultural production cooperatives were constantly asking the district committee to help solve problems. When Liu Zhendong went to Chuan Lianfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaojia Village, Chuan Lianfu asked Liu Zhendong to give him suggestions for improving his work. But Liu Zhendong chatted with Chuan Lianfu for a while and didn't find any problems. When he was about to leave, Chuan Lianfu sincerely said, "I hope Comrade Liu can come often to help!" This sentence made Liu Zhendong feel very uneasy. He thought to himself, "It's okay to come often, but how can I help?" He felt very embarrassed. Then another cooperative asked Liu Zhendong to solve a problem. Although the problem was solved, it was not solved well. What should I do? Liu Zhendong read the Party's documents on mutual aid and cooperation day and night. Although Liu Zhendong had studied for several years, he had been farming for more than ten years and had long neglected what he had learned. Therefore, it was very difficult to study the documents. He often had to think for a long time about a word and a sentence. Even so, Liu Zhendong still insisted on studying, often studying until late at night. After such a difficult learning process, Liu Zhendong understood a lot about running cooperatives, which broke through the first "hurdle" in running cooperatives.

    At this time, the Deputy Director of the County Committee Office happened to be at the Liu Hongda Agricultural Production Cooperative and asked Liu Zhendong to talk about the work in the district. When Liu Zhendong arrived at the Liu Hongda Cooperative, Liu Hongda was talking about his experience in establishing labor organizations, and he spoke very reasonably. The more Liu Zhendong listened, the more interested he became, and he wrote down all the important points. When Liu Zhendong went to other cooperatives to solve the problem of labor organization, he also had experience. This incident gave Liu Zhendong a good education, which made him further understand that to truly learn how to run a cooperative, he not only had to read documents, but also had to learn from the masses and learn from practical work, so that he could correctly implement the Party's policies. But learning from the masses is not an easy thing. When Liu Zhendong recalled his feelings of being a "primary school student" when he first arrived at the Liu Hongda Agricultural Production Cooperative, he said: "At that time, I had the petty-bourgeois face-saving idea. I clearly wanted Liu Hongda to introduce more experience, but I was afraid that Liu Hongda would ask questions, so I didn't dare to say much." Naturally, this shortcoming was quickly overcome by Liu Zhendong, because he understood that to truly learn how to run a cooperative, he had to go a step further and go into practice. Later, he often went to advanced agricultural production cooperatives such as Liu Hongda to learn.

    During the spring plowing, Liu Zhendong went to the Chuan Lianfu Agricultural Production Cooperative to work again. The Chuan Lianfu Agricultural Production Cooperative originally made a lot of noise every night about the work points, and the members were very dissatisfied. Later, Chuan Lianfu mobilized the members to study a method of assigning work in groups and recording work points. The group leader recorded the work points every day, and the group leader reported the accounts to the accountant in the evening. In this way, the members could go home to rest after finishing their work, and they were all very satisfied. Liu Zhendong thought that this method was very good, so he helped Chuan Lianfu summarize this experience and promoted this experience to cooperatives such as Wei Hankui in Pantai Village. In this way, Liu Zhendong understood that he not only had to learn from the masses, but also had to summarize the advanced experience of the masses and use it to promote the work of ordinary cooperatives. In the past year, many advanced experiences of agricultural production cooperatives in the Ninth District have been promoted in this way.

    Whenever he talked about the achievements of the experimental establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in the entire district, Liu Zhendong always said: "This is the result of the leadership of the district committee and the efforts of all the comrades in the district." However, it is precisely because Liu Zhendong is good at relying on the district committee and all the comrades in the district that he has fully exerted this collective leadership power. The cadres in the district said: "Whenever Comrade Liu presides over a meeting, he never expresses his own opinions first, but waits for the comrades to speak freely, and then draws correct parts from the comrades' speeches, supplements or revises his own opinions, and makes decisions after everyone's discussion." Liu Zhendong's division of labor among the district committee members is mainly responsible for leading and researching the work of agricultural production cooperatives. He has been to all fifteen cooperatives in the district two or three times, except for one that he has not been to. When he found major problems in the cooperatives, he always brought them up to the district committee meeting for discussion before making a decision. For example, after some wealthy members joined the cooperative, they all retained a lot of their own cultivated land, and the cooperative also cultivated the extra land for them, and the wages were paid with their own workdays. This incident was discovered during the summer hoeing, and it was brought up to the district committee meeting for research. The research result was that everyone realized that this was a wealthy household trying to exploit within the cooperative. Then they studied a solution.

    In the past year, thanks to the full play of the collective wisdom of the district committee members, although the experimental establishment of agricultural production cooperatives was an unfamiliar task, some of the problems encountered in running the cooperatives have been reasonably resolved in a timely manner. Liu Zhendong himself has also greatly improved his leadership thinking and leadership methods because he is good at absorbing the opinions and experiences of others.

    When some agricultural production cooperatives brought all the big and small problems to the district committee for solution, Liu Zhendong thought, "This won't work. The district cadres can't live in the cooperatives for a long time. If there are more and more agricultural production cooperatives in the future, if we don't cultivate the ability of grassroots cadres to run the cooperatives independently, the cooperatives will not be run well."

    When Liu Zhendong went to Chenjia Village, he called the branch secretary Li Mingqi to talk about the situation. After talking for a long time, Li Mingqi only talked about the mutual aid team, and he didn't know anything about the agricultural production cooperative. At that time, Liu Zhendong was very unhappy and wanted to criticize him, but he thought that this could not be blamed on Li Mingqi, mainly because he had not been given such a task. So Liu Zhendong said to Li Mingqi very gently: "The agricultural production cooperative is the example of the mutual aid team, and the branch must pay special attention to leading it!" Then he went to the Zheng Baofa Agricultural Production Cooperative with Li Mingqi and studied the work together with him, and solved the problems in the cooperative. When he was about to leave, Liu Zhendong instructed the branch secretary and the cooperative director to keep in touch and work together to run the cooperative well. Liu Zhendong received a letter from Li Mingqi seven or eight days after returning to the district, reporting that problems had arisen in the Zheng Baofa cooperative again, but they had all been resolved. Liu Zhendong was very happy after reading the letter and immediately wrote a reply to Li Mingqi, encouraging him to help the agricultural production cooperative solve problems often, and also hoping that he would report to the district committee often. From then on, Liu Zhendong realized the importance of teaching the branch to lead the agricultural production cooperative, and he brought this issue to the district committee meeting for research. The district committee first conducted an inspection and found that the reason why the village branches did not manage the agricultural production cooperative was first because the district committee did not teach the branches the method of leading the agricultural production cooperative, and the branches did not dare to go to the cooperative because they did not understand the agricultural production cooperative. So the district committee decided to teach the branches how to run the cooperative. The pilot result was very good. The relationship between the branch and the cooperative also became closer. Some cooperative directors would go to the branch whenever there was a problem, and the branch would also take the initiative to understand the situation of the cooperative and help the cooperative solve problems. Zhang Guangrong, the secretary of the Hujiang Village branch, said to the people of the agricultural production cooperative: "In the past, because I didn't understand the business, I didn't dare to ask about your affairs. Now the district is helping me like this, which makes me feel very clear in my heart. I will definitely go to your cooperative often in the future and study with everyone!"

    During the slack season, Liu Zhendong found that most of the management committees of the cooperatives did not understand their work tasks, and the district cadres replaced the work of the management committees. This is a problem worth noting. For this reason, when launching the increase production and thrift campaign in the autumn, Liu Zhendong went to the Xu Baiyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaojia Village to teach the district cadres how to lead the agricultural production cooperative and how to organize the management committee and all the members to jointly decide on the major affairs in the cooperative. The district cadres should speak at the "critical moment" and give the masses more ideas, not just give orders to the masses, so as to cultivate the management committee of the agricultural production cooperative to solve problems independently. In this way, the district cadres learned how to lead the agricultural production cooperative.

    Liu Zhendong also paid attention to learning from the past lessons in his work. For example, he reviewed his leadership work in the agricultural production cooperatives in the past year and found that he had blindly reorganized an agricultural production cooperative without starting from reality. After the general line was publicized this time, farmers in various villages once had a tendency to blindly run cooperatives. Liu Zhendong learned from the past lessons and analyzed the reasons for this phenomenon with the district committee members. They believed that the main reason was that when publicizing the general line, they only talked about the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, but did not publicize the conditions for organizing agricultural production cooperatives. Based on this actual situation, they decided to further publicize the general line, explain the nature of agricultural production cooperatives and the specific conditions for running cooperatives in detail, point out the direction of efforts for those who did not meet the conditions for running cooperatives, and actively help those who met the conditions to establish agricultural production cooperatives.

    区委副书记刘振东学会了领导农业生产合作社
  　焦殿珍
    中共辽西省绥中县第九区委员会副书记刘振东，原来和全区干部一样，对农业生产合作社工作是生疏的，但是经过艰苦学习，他终于成为一个领导农业生产合作社的好干部。
    一九五二年，刘振东被调任九区区委副书记时，心里虽然很高兴，但想到九区有农业生产合作社时，思想上就有了负担。他想：互助组的问题解决不了，农业生产合作社不是更难领导吗！但又想到自己是个共产党员要克服一切困难。刘振东到九区，起初仍怕做领导农业生产合作社的工作。比如有一次，刘振东到孙家村去，眼看就要走进王宝山村了，蓦然记起刘洪达农业生产合作社就在这个村里，心想：“万一刘洪达要我去帮助解决社里的问题，那我怎么办呢？”于是他绕过王宝山村走了。
    不久，刘振东参加领导全区整党工作。在进行新旧两条道路教育的时候，有的党员回忆起过去受地主压迫的生活，沉痛地检讨了自己不领导互助合作，光顾个人发财的资本主义思想。这时刘振东才了解到自己的责任重大，不积极领导大家走互助合作的道路，有人就会走资本主义的道路。刘振东想到自己过去怕领导农业生产合作社的情形，很惭愧。一个共产党员，不积极地领导农民办好农业生产合作社，这能叫做为共产主义事业奋斗吗？又想到初来九区时，县委曾嘱咐：“九区工作任务很重，一定要努力领导全区同志把工作做好！”这时刘振东心里很难过，不由地暗自责备自己：我是区委副书记，这样怕困难，那么区里其他同志又该怎样呢？想来想去下定决心要领导全区干部把农业生产合作社办好。
      一九五二年，九区虽然试办过七个农业生产合作社，但都是县委试办的，区委根本没有过问这一工作。因此，到一九五三年区委着手试办农业生产合作社时，就没有经验。同时，新建的八个农业生产合作社，又不断地要求区委会帮助解决问题。刘振东到肖家村揣连富农业生产合作社时，揣连富就要求刘振东给他提出改进工作的意见。可是刘振东和揣连富唠叨了一阵没发现问题。临走时揣连富还诚恳地说：“希望刘同志经常来帮助！”这句话使刘振东感到十分不安，心想：“经常来是可以，可是怎样帮助呢？”他觉得很为难。接着又有一个社请刘振东去解决问题，问题虽然解决了，但没解决好。怎么办呢？刘振东就日夜翻阅党的有关互助合作政策的文件。虽然刘振东念过几年书，可是已种了十多年地，早把念的书荒废了。因此学习文件时十分困难，常常为了一个字和一个句子要思考很长时间。虽然这样，刘振东仍坚持学习，经常学到深夜。经过这样一个艰苦的学习过程，刘振东就懂得了不少办社的道理，这就突破了办社的第一道“难关”。
    这时正好县委办公室副主任到了刘洪达农业生产合作社，要刘振东去谈谈区里的工作。刘振东到刘洪达社时，刘洪达正在讲建立劳动组织的经验，讲得很有道理。刘振东越听越有兴趣，便把重要的问题都记了下来。刘振东到别的社解决劳动组织问题时，也就有了经验。这件事给了刘振东一次很好的教育，使他进一步懂得了要真正学会办社不光要读文件，并且要向群众学习，从实际工作中学习，这样才能正确地执行党的方针政策。可是向群众学习并不是一件轻而易举的事情。刘振东回想刚到刘洪达农业生产合作社做“小学生”的心情时说：“那时有小资产阶级的爱面子思想，明明想让刘洪达多介绍些经验，但又怕刘洪达提出问题来问，就不敢多说话。”自然这个缺点很快地就被刘振东克服了，因为他懂得要真正学会办社还必须深入一步，到实践中去。以后他经常到刘洪达等先进农业生产合作社去学习。
    春耕时，刘振东又到揣连富农业生产合作社去工作。揣连富农业生产合作社原先每晚都因为记工账的事嚷嚷到半夜，社员很不满意，后来揣连富发动社员研究出分组干活记工的办法，每天干活由组长记工，晚间由组长向会计报账。这样社员干完活就可以回家休息了，都很满意。刘振东认为这个办法很好，就帮助揣连富总结了这一经验，并且向潘台村魏汉奎等社推广了这一经验。这样，刘振东又懂得了不独要向群众学习，还要总结群众的先进经验，用来推广一般社的工作。一年来，九区农业生产合作社的许多先进经验，就是这样推广的。
    每当谈到全区试办农业生产合作社的成就时，刘振东总是说：“这是区委的领导和全区同志努力得来的。”但是，正因为刘振东善于依靠区委和全区同志，才充分发挥了这种集体的领导力量。区里的干部说：“刘同志不论主持什么会议，总不是先发表自己一套意见，而是等同志们尽所欲言后，然后从同志们的发言中吸取正确的部分，补充或修正自己的意见，经过大家讨论，做出决定。”刘振东在区委委员中的分工，主要是负责领导和研究农业生产合作社的工作，全区十五个社除一个社他没去过外，都去过两三次。他在社里发现了主要问题，都是提到区委会上讨论后才做决定。比如有好些富裕的社员入社后，都留了许多自耕地，多留的地还让社里给耕种，工钱用自己的劳动日顶。这件事在夏锄时被发现了，就提到区委会上进行研究，研究结果，大家认识到这是富裕户想在社内进行剥削。接着就研究出了解决的办法。
    一年来由于充分发挥了区委委员的集体智慧，虽然试办农业生产合作社是个生疏的工作，但办社中所遇到的一些问题，都及时得到了合理的解决，刘振东本人也因善于吸取别人的意见和经验，在领导思想和领导方法上有很大的提高。
    当有些农业生产合作社把大小问题都提到区委来解决时，刘振东想，“这哪行，区干部也不能长久住在社里啊，今后农业生产合作社越来越多，要不培养基层干部独立办社的能力，合作社是办不好的。”
    刘振东到陈家村，就把支部书记李鸣岐找来谈情况，谈了半天，李鸣岐只讲互助组的事，他对农业生产合作社的事一点也不知道。当时刘振东很不高兴，正想提出批评，但又想到这不能怨李鸣岐，主要是没有交给他这样的任务。于是刘振东很温和地向李鸣岐说：“农业生产合作社是互助组的榜样，支部得特别注意领导啊！”接着就同李鸣岐到郑宝发农业生产合作社去，与他共同研究工作，把社里的问题解决了。临走时刘振东又嘱咐支部书记和社主任以后要经常联系，共同努力把社办好。刘振东回区七、八天工夫，就接到李鸣岐一封信，报告郑宝发社里又出了问题，但都解决了。刘振东看了信很高兴，立刻给李鸣岐写了回信，鼓励他要经常帮助农业生产合作社解决问题，还希望他经常向区委做汇报。从此以后，刘振东更认识到教会支部领导农业生产合作社的重要性，他并把这个问题提到区委会上进行研究。区委先做了检查，发现各村支部所以没有管农业生产合作社的事情，首先是因为区委没有教给支部领导农业生产合作社的方法，支部因为不懂得农业生产合作社的事情，也就不敢到社里去。于是区委决定教会支部办社。试行结果很好。支部和社的关系也密切了。有的社主任一有问题就去找支部，支部也主动了解社的情况，帮助社解决问题。虎将村支部书记张广荣对农业生产合作社的人说：“从前因我不懂行，对你们的事也不敢问，现在区上这样帮助我，使我心里透了亮，以后保证经常到你们社里去，和大家一同学习！”
    在挂锄期间，刘振东发现大部分社的管理委员会不了解自己的工作任务，而区干部又代替了管理委员会的工作。这是个值得注意的问题。为此，秋季开展增产节约运动时，刘振东便到肖家村徐栢峪农业生产合作社，教给区干部怎样领导农业生产合作社，怎样组织社的管理委员会和全体社员一同来决定社内的大事情。区干部要在“节骨眼上”发言，要给群众多出主意，不要只给群众下命令，这样才能培养农业生产合作社的管理委员会独立来解决问题。这样，区干部就学会了领导农业生产合作社的办法。
    刘振东在工作中还注意接受过去的教训。比如他检查了一年来对农业生产合作社的领导工作，发现由于自己不从实际出发盲目改组了一个农业生产合作社。这次宣传总路线后，各村农民曾一度发生盲目办社的倾向。刘振东就接受过去的教训，和区委委员具体分析了产生这一现象的原因，认为主要是宣传总路线时，只讲了农业生产合作社的优越性，没有宣传组织农业生产合作社的条件。根据这
  一实际情况，他们决定再进一步深入宣传总路线，详细地讲解农业生产合作社的性质和办社的具体条件，给不够办社条件的指出努力的方向，对够条件的，积极帮助成立农业生产合作社。
