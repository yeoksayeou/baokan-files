Southwest Region Carries Out Work to Establish Agricultural Cooperatives

    The Southwest Region plans to establish 1,002 agricultural production cooperatives before the spring plowing season. Among these, Sichuan Province will establish 458, Yunnan Province will establish 259 in 69 counties, Guizhou will establish 240 in 79 counties and cities, Xikang Province will establish 33 in two special districts and one suburban area, and Chongqing City will establish 12 in five suburban areas. In order to earnestly implement the principle of "active leadership, steady progress" and the principle of cooperative establishment of "only allowing good establishment, not allowing bad establishment," Party committees at all levels have dispatched capable cadres to be specifically responsible for the work of establishing cooperatives. The county Party committees have all conducted detailed research and arrangements for the work of establishing cooperatives before the spring plowing, and have also held intensive training sessions for township branch secretaries, mutual aid team leaders, and cadres stationed in the cooperatives who are preparing to establish cooperatives. The Fuling and Suining district committees in Sichuan Province have also trained financial accounting personnel for the agricultural production cooperatives, preparing the conditions for improving the cooperative's financial system. The Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has dispatched four working groups to Lushun, Zunyi and other places to provide specific guidance and assistance for the work of establishing cooperatives. The Duyun District Committee has designated eight county committee members and nineteen district-level cadres to be specifically responsible for leading the establishment of cooperatives, with an average of three or four specially responsible cadres in each place where cooperatives are being established. At present, these newly established cooperatives have generally shifted to resolving specific issues such as shareholding. Some cooperatives have already been established and are fully engaged in production.

    Through this stage of cooperative establishment work, the socialist consciousness of the masses has been significantly improved, and the enthusiasm for participating in mutual assistance and cooperation has generally increased. Many farmers who had withdrawn from cooperatives and teams have returned to the teams and cooperatives. In many areas, because attention was paid from the beginning to combining the establishment of cooperatives with improving mutual aid teams and production work, mutual aid teams and various agricultural activities have developed during the cooperative establishment period. As of February 10, Guizhou Province had established 206 cooperatives, and more than 220,000 mutual aid teams had also been largely further consolidated, and a new batch had been developed on this basis. At present, the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in Guizhou Province is developing vigorously. It is estimated that agricultural production cooperatives will develop to more than 400 before the spring plowing, and mutual aid teams will also have greater development. (Shu Daixin)

    西南区开展建立农业合作社工作
    西南区计划在春耕生产以前办好一千零两个农业生产合作社，其中四川省办四百五十八个，云南省在六十九个县内办二百五十九个，贵州在七十九个县、市内办二百四十个，西康省在两个专区一个市郊办三十三个，重庆市在五个郊区办十二个。为了切实贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针和“只许办好，不许办坏”的建社原则，中共各级党委都抽派得力干部专门负责办社工作。县委对春耕以前的办社工作都详细地作了研究和布置，并集训了准备办社的乡支部书记、互助组长和驻社干部。四川涪陵、遂宁等地委还训练了农业生产合作社的财务会计人员，为健全社的财务制度准备了条件。中共贵州省委已派出四个工作组，分赴炉山、遵义等地具体指导与帮助建社工作。都匀地委确定八个县委委员和十九个区级干部专责领导办社，平均每一个办社的地方都有三、四个专责干部。目前，这些新办的社一般都已转入解决入股等具体问题。部分社已经建成，全力投入生产。
    通过这一阶段的建社工作，群众的社会主义觉悟有了显著提高，要求参加互助合作的热情普遍高涨。不少已经退社退组的农民又都回组回社。许多地区由于开始就注意了办社与提高互助组和生产工作相结合，因而在建社期间互助组和各项农事活动都有了发展。贵州省到二月十日为止，全省已建成二百零六个社，同时二十二万多个互助组也大部分得到进一步巩固，并在此基础上又发展了一批。目前贵州省互助合作运动正蓬勃开展，估计春耕前农业生产合作社将发展到四百个以上，互助组也将有更大发展。（舒代新）
