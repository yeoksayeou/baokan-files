The mutual aid and cooperation movement in North China has made great progress.

[Beijing News] Based on the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in mutual aid and cooperation in various parts of North China, and by conscientiously implementing the policy of "active leadership and steady advancement," agricultural producers' cooperatives have been vigorously developed, resulting in great progress in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

As of mid-February, according to statistics from Hebei and Shanxi provinces and the suburban areas of Beijing and Tianjin, more than 17,400 new agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established. Hebei Province has completed the establishment of more than 9,950 cooperatives, is in the process of establishing more than 7,030, and more than 15,000 mutual aid teams have requested to be converted into cooperatives. The final number of cooperatives to be established in the province's counties is 17,570, and the number of cooperatives already established accounts for 56.6 percent of the determined number. Shanxi Province has newly established 7,052 cooperatives, with more than 205,500 peasant households participating in the newly established cooperatives, an increase of nearly four times compared with the total number of cooperative members last year. Including the original old cooperatives, Shanxi has more than 9,290 cooperatives, with more than 257,000 peasant households participating, accounting for more than 8 percent of the province's total number of peasant households. In Changzhi Prefecture, the number of peasant households participating in cooperatives has accounted for 19.7 percent of the prefecture's total number of peasant households. In Pingshun County, the number of peasant households participating in cooperatives has increased from 11.5 percent of the county's total number of peasant households last year to 42 percent. The suburban areas of Beijing have established 310 new cooperatives, and including the old cooperatives (the original 63, which were merged and expanded into 53), there are now 363 cooperatives. More than 100 new cooperatives have also been established in the suburban areas of Tianjin. While establishing cooperatives, mutual aid teams have also been further consolidated and developed. According to statistics from Yongnian, Jianguo, and three other counties and 75 townships in Hebei Province alone, more than 11,600 new mutual aid teams have been developed. Since last winter, nearly 30,000 peasant households in Shanxi Province have joined mutual aid teams. Xin County Prefecture, which originally had 1 percent of villages with no mutual aid and cooperation, has now basically eliminated this situation. In Qin County, the number of peasant households organized has increased from 68.9 percent of the total number of peasant households to 80.5 percent.

The rapid development and large scale of the cooperative establishment work in various places is due to the fact that the propaganda of the general line has raised the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, who are actively demanding to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and it is also closely related to the large-scale training of cadres and cooperative establishment backbones in various places. Before the Spring Festival, Hebei Province trained more than 39,000 cooperative establishment cadres, and after the Spring Festival, each county held expanded meetings of county, district, and township cadres. In order to strengthen leadership, each county has organized a mutual aid and cooperation office, which is personally managed by the responsible comrades of the Party Committee. According to statistics from Zhangjiakou and four other prefectures, more than 1,000 cadres have also been organized to go to various places to help establish cooperatives.

At present, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in North China has entered the stage of consolidation and improvement. Various places will conduct a general inspection to help cooperatives solve problems such as the contribution of cattle and farm tools as shares, and formulate necessary production plans. Backbone personnel, accountants, and production technicians will be trained in a planned manner. In addition to further strengthening political and ideological education to raise the socialist consciousness of cooperative members, various places will also provide agricultural producers' cooperatives with the necessary economic support and technical guidance so that they can carry out production smoothly. At the same time, mutual aid teams will also be vigorously rectified, consolidated, and improved.

    华北区互助合作运动有很大进展
    【本报讯】华北各地在广大农民互助合作积极性空前高涨的基础上，认真贯彻“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，大力发展农业生产合作社，使互助合作运动有了很大进展。
    截至二月中旬为止，据河北、山西两省和北京、天津两市郊区的统计，共已新建立了一万七千四百多个农业生产合作社。河北省已建成的社有九千九百五十多个，正在建立的有七千零三十多个，还有一万五千多个互助组要求转社。全省各县最后核定建社数是一万七千五百七十个，现已建成社占核定数的百分之五十六点六。山西省已新建七千零五十二个社，参加新建社的农民有二十万五千五百余户，较去年原有社员总数增加将近四倍。山西连原有老社共是九千二百九十多个，参加农户二十五万七千多户，占全省总农户数百分之八强。长治专区入社农户已占该区总农户数的百分之十九点七。平顺县入社农户已由去年占全县总农户的百分之十一点五发展到百分之四十二。北京市郊区已建立了三百一十个新社，连老社（原有六十三个，经合并扩大为五十三个）已有三百六十三个。天津市郊区也建立了一百多个新社。在建社同时，互助组也有了进一步的巩固和发展。河北省仅据永年、建国等五县和七十五个乡的统计，新发展的互助组即有一万一千六百多个。山西省自去冬以来，有近三万个农户加入互助组。忻县专区原有百分之一的互助合作空白村，现已基本消灭。沁县组织起来的农户由原来占总农户数的百分之六十八点九上升到百分之八十点五。
    各地建社工作之所以发展迅速，规模巨大，除因宣传总路线提高了广大农民社会主义觉悟，积极要求走互助合作道路外，与各地大批训练干部和建社骨干也有很大关系。河北省在春节前就训练了三万九千多名建社干部，春节后各县又都召开了县、区、乡干部扩大会。为了加强领导，各县都组织了互助合作办公室，由党委负责同志亲自掌握。另据张家口等五个专区统计，还组织了一千多名干部分赴各地帮助建社。
    目前华北区互助合作运动已进入巩固和提高的阶段。各地将普遍进行检查，帮助合作社解决耕牛、农具入股等问题和制订必要的生产计划等。并将有计划地训练骨干、会计和生产技术人员。各地除进一步加强政治思想教育，提高社员的社会主义觉悟外，还将给农业生产合作社以必要的经济扶植和技术指导，使他们能够顺利地进行生产。同时，对互助组也将大力进行整顿和巩固提高。
