Shanxi Province to Build Ten New Animal-Drawn Farm Implement Stations This Year, and Prepare to Establish Two Tractor Stations and Four Mechanized Farms

Shanxi Province plans to trial run ten state-owned animal-drawn farm implement stations this year, and newly build two agricultural machine tractor stations and four mechanized farms.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has allocated 3.46 billion yuan this year to establish ten animal-drawn farm implement stations in ten villages with relatively good agricultural production cooperatives and flat land, including Chenjiazhuang in Datong County, Dalü Village in Xia County, Xiaoguo Village in Changzi, Shidian in Jincheng, Dazhai in Yushe, Jiajie Village in Taiyuan City, Maxinzhuang in Datong City, Xiliang in Yicheng, and Nanyuan in Hongdong. To help the new stations do a good job in construction, the Provincial Department of Agriculture held a training course in January for 71 station directors, accountants, technicians and other station construction cadres. Now, each station is signing cultivation contracts with local farmers. The thirty sets of animal-drawn farm implements (each set including double-wheeled double-furrow plows, double-wheeled single-furrow plows, rocker-arm harvesters, ten-row seeders, twelve-disc harrows, rollers and other major farm implements) ordered from Northeast China, North China and Taiyuan Machine Factory last year have been successively transported to each station. All of them will be put into production during the spring ploughing.

In order to plan the establishment of state-owned mechanized farms and tractor stations, the Department of Agriculture of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government sent a large number of survey and measurement personnel to Shuoxian, Shanyin, Yuncheng and other places with better conditions for building farms to conduct surveys, in order to determine the location for establishing mechanized farms and agricultural machine tractor stations. Currently, the focus is on studying the construction of two new state-owned tractor stations and four state-owned mechanized farms this year.

    山西省今年新建十个马拉农具站
    并准备建立两个拖拉机站和四个机耕农场
    山西省今年计划试办国营马拉农具站十处，新建农业机器拖拉机站两处，机耕农场四处。
    山西省人民政府今年拨款三十四亿六千万元，在农业生产合作社基础较好、土地平坦的大同县陈家庄、夏县大吕村、长子小郭村、晋城十店、榆社大寨、太原市嘉节村、大同市马辛庄、翼城西梁及洪洞南垣等十村建立了十个马拉农具站。为帮助新建站作好建站工作，该省农业厅在一月份集训了七十一名站长、会计、技术员等建站干部。现在各站正和当地农民签订耕种合同。去年向东北、华北及太原机器厂定购的三十套马拉农具（每套包括双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁、摇臂收割机、十行播种机、十二片圆盘耙、镇压器等主要农具），已陆续运到各站。春耕中即将都投入生产。
    山西省人民政府农业厅为了有计划地建立国营机耕农场和拖拉机站，曾抽派大批调查测量人员，分赴建场条件较好的朔县、山阴、运城等地进行勘查，以便确定建立机耕农场及农业机器拖拉机站的地点。目前正着重研究今年新建两个国营拖拉机站和四个国营机耕农场的建站、建场工作。
