Huainan mining area's large-scale capital construction is about to begin. The construction of Xiejiaji No. 2 new shaft in the Bagongshan new coalfield area will start soon. In addition, three pairs of modern vertical shafts, namely No. 3 shaft and Laishanjiji shaft, will also start construction successively within the year. After these three pairs of vertical shafts are put into production, the coal output of the Huainan mining area will be twice the current output.

These three pairs of vertical shafts are designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel with the help of Soviet experts. The entire production process will be fully mechanized and partially automated. In order to ensure the workers' health and improve their material and cultural living standards, office buildings, dormitories, cooperatives, nurseries, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, clubs, hospitals, parks, and sports fields and other health and welfare facilities will be built while the shafts and roadways are being excavated.

At present, the preparatory work for the start of construction of Xiejiaji No. 2 vertical shaft has been basically completed. A pair of huge temporary wooden headframes has stood towering above the shaft opening; the construction workers have learned modern construction techniques and have come to the construction site; the large electric winch has been installed and is being tested. Preparatory work for the start of construction of the Caijiagang mine and Xiejiaji No. 3 vertical shaft is already underway, and construction is planned to start in April and July respectively. The reconstruction project of Xinzhuangzi mine and the new construction project of Laishanjiji vertical shaft will also start successively in the second half of this year.

    淮南煤矿今年将建设三对新井
    淮南煤矿区大规模的基本建设即将开始，八公山新煤田区谢家集二号新井的建设工程，不日动工，另外三号井及癞山集井两对现代化竖井，年内也将陆续开工。这三对竖井投入生产后，淮南矿区的煤产量将为目前的两倍。
    这三对竖井由我国工程技术人员在苏联专家帮助下自行设计，其整个生产过程将是全部机械化和部分自动化的。为了保证工人的身体健康和提高工人的物质文化生活水平，在开凿井筒和巷道的同时，还要建筑办公大楼和宿舍、合作社、托儿所、幼儿园、小学、中学、俱乐部、医院、公园和运动场等卫生福利设施。
    目前，谢家集二号竖井开工前的各项准备工作，已经基本就绪，一对巨大的临时木井架，已经巍然矗立在井口上面；建井工人已经学会了现代化的施工技术，来到了工地；大型电绞车已经安装完毕，正在试车。蔡家岗矿井和谢家集三号竖井动工前的准备工作，已在着手进行，计划在四月份和七月份先后动工。新庄孜矿井的改建工程和癞山集竖井新建工程，也将在今年下半年陆续开工。
