Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 15th: More than 800 railway workers from the Jinan Railway Bureau who volunteered to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea victoriously returned home, arriving in Jinan on the afternoon of March 9th. Ma Bao San, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Branch of the China Peace Committee, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Standing Committee, along with responsible comrades from the Shandong Military Region, Jinan Municipal People's Government, Jinan Railway Bureau, and over 2,000 people from all walks of life in Jinan went to the station to welcome them. At the welcoming rally held at the station, Gao Feng, a representative of the volunteer railway workers who resisted U.S. aggression and aided Korea and recipient of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Third Class National Flag Order, said: Entrusted by the people of the motherland, we participated in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and now we have returned victoriously. However, we will never relax our vigilance against the U.S. imperialists who are still plotting to provoke a new war. We will continue to support the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

These railway workers who volunteered to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea made many contributions during the three-year struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Among them, fourteen people were awarded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea National Flag Order, one hundred and thirty-four people were awarded Military Service Medals, two people were credited with Second Class Merits, and forty-seven people were credited with Third Class Merits. Liu Xingzhou, a recipient of the Second Class Merit and Military Service Medal, rescued forty-six Chinese and Korean workers and peaceful Korean residents on eight round trips to the station in the snowy night, braving enemy aircraft bombing and strafing in the Korean highlands. The local Korean people hung his portrait on the streets, calling him a rescue hero. After the Korean armistice, these railway workers who volunteered to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea also helped the Korean people restore and rebuild many railway bridges and culverts, and helped many Korean people rebuild their homes.

    抗美援朝铁路职工八百多人胜利回国
    【新华社济南十五日电】济南铁路管理局志愿抗美援朝职工八百多人胜利归国，在三月九日下午到达济南。山东省抗美援朝分会副主席、山东省各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席马保三及山东军区、济南市人民政府、济南铁路管理局等单位负责人和济南市各界人民两千多人前往车站欢迎。在车站上举行的欢迎大会上，志愿抗美援朝职工代表、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三级国旗勋章获得者高峰说：我们奉祖国人民的委托参加抗美援朝斗争，现在胜利地归来了。但是，我们对仍旧在阴谋挑起新战争的美帝国主义者，决不放松警惕，我们还要继续支持抗美援朝的斗争，争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    这批抗美援朝铁路职工在三年多的抗美援朝斗争中立了许多功绩。他们之中荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗勋章的有十四人，荣获军功章的有一百三十四人，立二等功的二人，立三等功的四十七人。二等功臣、军功章获得者刘星洲，曾在朝鲜高原一带，在雪夜里冒着敌机的轰炸和扫射，往返车站八次之多，抢救出中朝职工和朝鲜和平居民四十六人。当地朝鲜人民把他的像片挂在街头上，称他是抢救英雄。这批志愿抗美援朝铁路职工在朝鲜停战以后，又帮助朝鲜人民恢复和重建了许多铁路的桥梁和涵洞，并帮助许多朝鲜人民重建家园。
