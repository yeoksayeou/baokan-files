Congratulatory Telegram to the All-China Democratic Women's Federation from the Inaugural Meeting of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation:

To the All-China Democratic Women's Federation:

Under the correct leadership of the great leader of the motherland, Chairman Mao, the Han and Tibetan nationalities are united firmly. In an atmosphere of national equality and gender equality, we are earnestly implementing the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Last year, we established the Preparatory Committee of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, and on this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, we officially established the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation; this is the happiness of us Tibetan women, and we feel boundless joy. In the future, we will certainly unite closely under the banner of patriotism and strive to build a new Tibet and consolidate the national defense of the motherland. We hope to receive your kind instructions regularly.

Inaugural Meeting of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation

    拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会成立大会
    向中华全国民主妇女联合会致敬电中华全国民主妇女联合会：
    在祖国伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，汉、藏两民族巩固地团结起来了。我们正在民族平等和男女平等的气氛中，确实执行着关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。并在去年成立了拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会筹备委员会，到今年“三八”国际妇女节正式成立了拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会；这是我们西藏妇女的幸福，我们感到无限的欢欣。今后我们一定在爱国主义的旗帜下亲密团结起来，为建设新西藏，巩固祖国国防而努力。尚望经常给与亲切的指示。
