The Changchun Native Produce Company is strengthening its supply of non-staple foods to meet the growing consumption needs of the people.

After the National Native Produce Conference, the company clarified its business policy and criticized the erroneous thinking of "managing less to lose less" that did not start from the needs of the people.

In order to understand the production and sales situation, the company learned about the needs of people at all levels for non-staple foods through cooperatives and symposiums with catering units. It also studied the vegetable production situation in the city and suburbs through relevant units such as the Bureau of Farmland Water Conservancy, and combined this with mobilizing employees to discuss plans, formulate purchasing plans, and determine vegetable reserves. On this basis, it vigorously opened up sources of goods and actively organized purchases. The company has signed pre-purchase contracts for vegetables such as chives, spinach, coriander, and garlic sprouts with the Changchun State-owned Farm, agricultural production cooperatives, and seven vegetable farmers. It also sent special personnel to sign a contract for three million catties of Chinese cabbage with the Tangshan Special District Cooperative and the Shandong Native Produce Company. When purchasing livestock products, it closely cooperated with cooperatives in Shuangyang, Yitong, Nongan, Jiutai and other counties. In addition, 30 to 40 people were sent to the countryside to purchase.

In order to make it convenient for consumers to buy, the company developed a commercial network in the fourth quarter of last year and paid attention to improving business management. In addition to adding two retail outlets, a delivery system was established, and as soon as catering units and cooperatives told them what goods they needed, they were delivered immediately. At the same time, the "pay first, pay later" method was adopted for cooperatives. Some cooperatives did not dare to manage fine vegetables in the past, but now they can actively manage them. Since actively managing non-staple foods, the sales of native products companies have gradually increased. The variety of operating products has increased from more than 40 to more than 110. Deepen the publicity of grain policy and do a good job in grain unified sales.

    长春市土产公司积极经营副食品
    长春市土产公司为适应日益增长的人民消费需要，加强副食品供应工作。
    全国土产会议以后，该公司明确了经营方针，批判了过去不从人民需要出发的“少经营点，少损失点”的错误思想。
    为了摸清产销情况，该公司通过合作社和召开伙食单位座谈会，了解各阶层人民对副食品的需要，并通过农田水利局等有关单位，研究了市内、郊区蔬菜生产情况，结合发动职工讨论计划，制订了进货计划，确定了蔬菜储备量。在这个基础上，大力开辟货源，积极组织进货。该公司已和长春市国营农场、农业生产合作社及七家菜农订立了韭菜、菠菜、香菜、蒜苗等蔬菜的预购合同，并派专人和唐山专区合作社、山东土产公司签订了三百万斤的白菜合同。在收购畜产时，和双阳、伊通、农安、九台等县合作社密切结合，此外还经长有三、四十人深入农村收购。
    为使广大消费者购买方便，去年第四季度该公司发展了商业网，并注意改进经营管理。除增设了两个零售门市部外，并建立了送货制，只要伙食单位、合作社告诉要啥货，立刻就给送去。同时对合作社采取了“先付货，后交款”的办法。有些合作社过去不敢经营细菜，现已能积极经营。自积极经营副食品后土产公司的卖钱额逐渐上升。经营品种由四十多种增加到一百一十来种。深入宣传粮食政策做好粮食统销工作
