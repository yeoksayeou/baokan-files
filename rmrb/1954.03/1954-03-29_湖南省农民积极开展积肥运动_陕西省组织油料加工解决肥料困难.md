    Hunan Farmers Actively Carry Out Manure Accumulation Campaign
    Shaanxi Organizes Oilseed Processing to Solve Fertilizer Difficulties

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers in Hunan Province are actively carrying out a manure accumulation campaign and paying attention to cultivating green manure crops, striving to complete the task of increasing grain production by 7 percent this year throughout the province. Since the end of February and the beginning of March, all counties have convened district and township cadre meetings, addressing the situation of expanded autumn and winter crop areas and dispersed fertilizer use last year, mobilizing to launch a mass manure accumulation campaign. Currently, the manure accumulation campaign has rapidly unfolded, with some areas forming a high tide and achieving certain results. According to statistics from Xiangxiang, Xinshao, Shaoyang, Xiangtan, Hanshou, Yizhang and other places, tens of thousands of farmers in each county have been engaged in fertilizer accumulation work such as digging pond mud, collecting silk grass, scraping turf, and collecting wild manure. The newly accumulated fertilizer can generally increase the application of about ten loads per mu of field. In areas with more manure accumulation in Hanshou County, each mu has reached about sixty loads including the original manure. The manure accumulation campaign is now being combined with other production work and continues to progress.
    Hunan farmers are also actively carrying out work such as digging ditches for drainage to cultivate green manure crops. Green manure crops have always been one of the main sources of fertilizer in the plains of Hunan Province. Since liberation, due to the needs of production development, the sown area has continued to expand. Last winter, green manure crops in Hunan Province reached more than 9 million mu, an increase of 13 percent compared with the previous year. In order to create conditions for large-scale promotion of green manure crops in mountainous areas in the future, the Hunan Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department also sent three work teams last winter to promote 10,000 mu of green manure crops in the western and southern mountainous areas. At present, green manure crops throughout the province are growing well due to timely cultivation, and it is estimated that each mu can increase production by about 1,000 jin compared with the past. This increased production of green manure is equivalent to 100 million jin of night soil. The bumper harvest of all green manure this year can basically solve the problem of the lack of base fertilizer for a quarter of the rice fields in the province.

    Furthermore, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce is actively organizing machinery oil factories and handicraft oil workshops to process oilseeds to supply farmers with spring plowing fertilizer. Up to now, five machinery oil factories and two hundred and eighty-eight handicraft oil workshops have been accepted for processing. These oil factories and oil workshops can produce more than 200,000 jin of oil residue fertilizer every day.
    In order to support farmers in expanding production, workers are actively improving production and saving raw materials. Now the amount of cottonseed needed for each jin of cottonseed oil has been reduced from nine jin to eight jin, the oil yield has been increased, and the cost of oil residue fertilizer has been greatly reduced. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce has universally reduced the listed price of each jin of oil residue by forty to sixty yuan.

    湖南省农民积极开展积肥运动
    陕西省组织油料加工解决肥料困难
    湖南省广大农民在共产党和人民政府领导下，积极开展积肥运动，并注意培育绿肥作物，争取完成今年全省增产粮食百分之七的任务。自二月底三月初以来，各县都召开了区乡干部会议，针对去年秋冬作物面积扩大、肥料使用分散的情况，动员开展群众性的积肥运动。目前积肥运动已迅速展开，有的地区已形成高潮，并取得一定成绩。据湘乡、新邵、邵阳、湘潭、汉寿、宜章等地统计，每县都有数万农民分别投入挑塘泥、捞丝草、铲草皮、捡野粪等积肥工作。新积肥料一般都可使每亩田增施十担左右，汉寿县积肥多的地方，连原有粪肥每亩已达六十担左右。积肥运动现正结合其他生产工作继续进行。
    湖南省农民还积极进行挖沟排水等培育绿肥作物的工作。绿肥作物历来是湖南省平原地区主要肥源之一，解放以来，由于生产发展的需要，播种面积不断扩大。去年冬天，湖南省绿肥作物已经达到九百多万亩，比前年增加了百分之十三。为了创造今后在山区大量推广绿肥作物的条件，湖南省人民政府农林厅去冬并派出三个工作组到西部和南部山区推广绿肥作物一万亩。目前全省绿肥作物由于培育及时，大都长得很好，估计每亩可比过去增产一千斤左右。这些增产的绿肥，即相当于一万万斤大粪。今年全部绿肥的丰收，可以基本上解决全省四分之一稻田基肥缺乏的问题。

    又讯：陕西省人民政府商业厅积极组织机器油厂和手工业油坊进行油料加工，供应农民春耕肥料。截至目前为止，接受加工的有机器油厂五个、手工业油坊二百八十八个，这些油厂、油坊每天就可以生产油渣肥料二十多万斤。
    工人们为了支援农民扩大生产，都积极改进生产，节省原料。现在每斤棉油需要的棉籽，已由九斤减少到八斤，出油率提高了，因而油渣肥料的成本也大大降低。陕西人民政府商业厅把每斤油渣的牌价普遍降低了四十元到六十元。
