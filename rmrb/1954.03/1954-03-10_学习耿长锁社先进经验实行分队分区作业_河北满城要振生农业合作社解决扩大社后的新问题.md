Learning from Geng Changsuo Cooperative's Advanced Experience, Implementing Team-Based Zonal Operations
Yao Zhensheng Agricultural Cooperative in Mancheng, Hebei Solves New Problems After Expansion

    Members of the Yao Zhensheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaozhuang, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, are learning from the management experience of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative to consolidate the cooperative's organization, and all members are actively preparing for spring plowing.
    After the Yao Zhensheng Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded to a large cooperative with 161 households, there were more laborers and the work became more complex. Especially with the spring plowing season approaching, manure needed to be delivered, farm tools needed to be repaired, and wheat fields needed timely management, leading to an increasing number of problems. Yao Zhensheng, the cooperative's director, was very troubled by this, and many cooperative cadres were also concerned. After research, the director and cooperative cadres felt that the problems they were encountering had also been encountered by the Geng Changsuo Cooperative, but they had solved them. They could learn from Geng Changsuo Cooperative's management methods. Therefore, they found materials on how Geng Changsuo Cooperative ran its affairs well and studied and discussed them. After studying and discussing, everyone felt that if they adopted Geng Changsuo Cooperative's method of dividing land into cultivation zones and dividing labor into cultivation teams, they could solve the problem of disorder within the cooperative and improve production efficiency. After full discussion, the cooperative cadres divided the cooperative's land into five cultivation zones according to the cooperative's specific conditions, and also divided the labor force into five cultivation teams, appropriately allocating the cooperative's livestock to each team. However, when dividing the cultivation teams, some old cooperative members were unwilling to be with new cooperative members, disliking that they did not have the habit of collective labor in the past and feeling awkward. Some cultivation teams were also unwilling to take households with weak labor. Deputy Director Xu Jingui addressed this thinking, telling everyone: Geng Changsuo Cooperative's teams last year had unevenly distributed strength, with some teams having more households without labor and some teams having more households with labor, resulting in an inability to carry out comprehensive production in a unified pace, with some teams doing well in production and others not. Our cooperative must learn from this lesson to achieve increased production across the entire cooperative. Everyone felt that Xu Jingui was right, so they agreed to pair old cooperative members with new cooperative members and households without labor, with old cooperative members as the backbone to lead the new cooperative members and work together to increase production for the entire cooperative.
    When dividing the cultivation zones, the cooperative grasped two conditions: concentrated land and adapting to local conditions. They also made appropriate adjustments based on soil quality and the crops to be planted. Each team was responsible for cultivation zones with all types of crops, avoiding the phenomenon of labor being unevenly distributed due to each team managing a single crop.
    Since the Yao Zhensheng Cooperative divided the cultivation teams and cultivation zones, each team had a clear understanding of what to do, overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of labor allocation within the cooperative. To improve their team's production, cooperative members in each team actively sought work to do. Now, each team is preparing for spring plowing to achieve this year's production increase plan. All the manure accumulated by the cooperative has been delivered. During the manure delivery, Gao Luosheng, the captain of the large cart team, hitched up the carts early and unloaded them late. He delivered three loads to the same distance that others delivered two loads. Under his leadership, all twenty-one large carts also delivered an extra load. Yao Shutong, the captain of the livestock team, led the small group leaders responsible for raising livestock to inspect and repair the ropes and farm tools used by the livestock and the tools used for harrowing the land to preserve moisture. Now, each team has begun harrowing the land and has planted more than 30 mu of peas. After publicity and mobilization, each household has handed over the selected high-quality varieties of cotton, barley, and garlic to the cooperative.

    学习耿长锁社先进经验实行分队分区作业
    河北满城要振生农业合作社解决扩大社后的新问题
    河北省满城县要庄要振生农业生产合作社社员学习耿长锁农业生产合作社经营管理的经验，巩固社的组织，全体社员积极进行春耕生产准备。
    要振生农业生产合作社扩大到一百六十一户的大社后，劳动力多了，事情也复杂了。特别是春耕生产季节已到，粪要送，农具要修理，麦田要及时进行管理，问题越来越多，社长要振生为这事很苦恼，不少社干部心上也挂着这些事。社长和社干部经过研究，觉得他们碰到的这些问题，耿长锁社也碰到过，但是都把这些问题解决了，他们也可学习耿长锁社的管理办法。于是他们就找出耿长锁社怎样办好社的材料，进行学习和讨论。经过学习讨论，大家都感到如采用耿长锁社土地划分耕作区，劳力划分耕作队的办法，就可解决社内乱的问题，也能提高生产效率。经过充分讨论，社干部就按照本社具体条件，把本社土地划分了五个耕作区，劳力也划成五个耕作队，把社内的牲口适当地调配给各队。但在划耕作队时，有的旧社员不愿和新社员在一起，嫌他们过去没有集体劳动的习惯，觉得别扭；也有的耕作队不愿要劳力弱的户。副社长许金贵就针对这种思想，告诉大家：耿长锁社去年各队因力量调配不均，有的队没劳力户多，有的队有劳力户多，结果不能齐一步调进行全面生产，有的队生产搞的好，有的搞的不好。咱们社要接受这个教训，达到全社增产。大家都觉得许金贵说的对，于是同意把旧社的社员，和新入社的社员及没劳力户搭配开，以旧社社员为骨干带动新社员，共同为全社增产努力。
    该社在划耕作区时，掌握了土地集中，因地制宜的两个条件。再根据土质好坏、种植什么作物，作了适当的调整。各队所负责的耕作区什么作物都有，避免了各队经营单项作物，形成劳力忙闲不平衡的现象。
    要振生社自从划好了耕作队、耕作区以后，各队作什么都有了底，克服了社内支配劳力的混乱现象。各队社员为把队的生产搞好，都积极主动地找活干。现在各队都为实现今年的增产计划、进行春耕生产做准备。全社积的圈肥已经送完，在送粪中大车队长高洛生早套车、晚卸车，在同样远的地里别人送两车，他送三车，在他的带动下二十一辆大车也都多送了一趟。畜牧队队长要树同带领各喂养牲口的小组长，检查和修理了牲口使用的绳套和耙地保墒用的农具。现在各队已开始耙地，并种上了三十多亩豌豆。经过宣传动员，各户并已把选好的棉花、大麦、蒜等优良品种交到社里。
