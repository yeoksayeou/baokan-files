The message emphasized the important role played by Soviet youth in the cause of communist construction. The Central Committee of the CPSU expressed its belief that the Soviet youth, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, will permanently stand at the forefront of the democratic youth's struggle for world peace.
    Subsequently, Shelepin delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Komsomol.

Shelepin pointed out that Soviet youth greeted with great excitement the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU on rapidly increasing light industry, the food industry, and agriculture in the next two to three years. They responded in the spirit of Komsomol members to the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU on further developing grain production and reclaiming wasteland. 60,000 Komsomol members have already gone to the reclamation areas, and a total of 400,000 young people have applied to participate in the reclamation work.

Shelepin cited figures and facts to illustrate the educational situation of Soviet youth. He said that thanks to the tireless care of the Party and the government, the number of secondary schools, technical schools, and universities in the Soviet Union is increasing year by year. At present, the number of students in the Soviet Union is 57 million, an increase of 8 million compared with 1940, of which about 3 million are students in higher and secondary specialized schools.
