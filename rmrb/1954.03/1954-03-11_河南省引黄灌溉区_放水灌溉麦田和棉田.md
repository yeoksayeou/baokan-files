    Henan Province Yellow River Irrigation Area
    Releasing Water to Irrigate Wheat and Cotton Fields
    The Yellow River irrigation area in Henan Province has started drawing water for spring irrigation this year. 340,000 mu of wheat and 170,000 mu of cotton fields in the irrigation area can be irrigated. On March 3rd, some of the main canals officially started releasing water, and irrigation began on the 5th. The mighty Yellow River water flowed along the dense network of large and small channels into the wheat and cotton fields. It is expected that all wheat and cotton fields will be irrigated by mid-March. This spring irrigation can promote the greening and tillering of wheat, allow the top-dressed wheat to exert its fertilizer effect as soon as possible, and ensure that the cotton fields retain moisture for sowing.
    Before this spring irrigation, the Yellow River Irrigation Management Bureau of Henan Province held a water conservancy representative meeting, requesting that the irrigation area be expanded to 550,000 mu this year, striving for 600,000 mu. It is planned to release water for wheat fields in stages during sowing, winter irrigation, spring irrigation, jointing, and grain filling; cotton fields will be watered five times during sowing, budding, flowering, boll formation, and boll opening; and other millet and corn will each be watered four times. It is also necessary to strengthen irrigation management and promote rational water use to ensure increased grain and cotton production this year.
    Last winter, when wheat was sown in the Yellow River irrigation area of Henan Province, it was during the autumn drought, and wheat could not be sown. Thanks to the timely diversion of Yellow River water, all wheat fields in the entire irrigation area were sown in time. During the winter irrigation period, more than 93,600 mu of wheat were irrigated. According to a post-event investigation: the winter-irrigated wheat has "large leaves, many deep-rooted roots, and a shiny, energetic color." Before this spring irrigation, farmers in many villages in the irrigation area had completed the renovation of large and small canals in advance. Some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups also applied top dressing before releasing water. (Xinhua News Agency)

    河南省引黄灌溉区
    放水灌溉麦田和棉田
    河南省引黄灌溉区今年开始引水春灌，灌溉区内有三十四万亩小麦和十七万亩棉花地，可以得到灌溉。三月三日，部分干渠正式放水，五日起开始浇地。滔滔的黄水，沿着密如蛛网的大小渠道流进了麦田和棉花田，预计在三月中旬就可以把麦棉地全部浇完。这次春灌，可以促进小麦发青分蘖，使施过追肥的小麦尽快地发挥肥效，并使棉花地能保墒播种。
    引黄灌溉区在这次春灌以前，引黄灌溉济卫管理局曾召开了水利代表会议，要求今年把灌溉面积扩大到五十五万亩并争取到六十万亩。计划小麦地分别在播种、冬灌、春灌、拔节、灌浆等分期放水；棉花地在播种、结蕾、开花、结铃、吐絮浇五遍水；其他谷子、玉米各浇四遍水。并要从加强灌溉管理、提倡合理用水等方面保证今年粮、棉增产。
    河南省引黄灌溉区去冬小麦播种时，正当秋旱，小麦下不了种；由于及时引灌黄水，使全灌区小麦地都及时地得到播种。冬灌期中，又浇了九万三千六百多亩小麦，据事后调查：冬灌过的小麦，“叶大根多扎的深，颜色油油有精神”。这次春灌前，灌区不少乡村农民都提前完成了大小渠道的整修工作。有些农业生产合作社和互助组，还在放水前施了追肥。（新华社）
