Since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, the creation of mass songs across the country has been quite vigorous. In terms of quantity, no less than ten thousand mass songs have been published in various regions over the past few years. They inherit the fighting tradition of revolutionary music, adhere to the political tasks of various periods, reflect the new face of the country and the new life of the people, and encourage the people's fighting will and labor enthusiasm.

In the past, although the quantity of mass song creation was large, and some excellent works were produced, many of these songs often replaced vivid artistic images with empty political slogans and generalized tunes because the authors lacked a deep understanding of real life and failed to reflect the political tasks of various periods from life. They lacked profound ideological feelings and artistic appeal, and therefore could not play their due role and be widely sung by the masses. In the future, we should strengthen the leadership of mass song creation, enrich the themes and forms of mass songs, and reflect the socialist construction of the motherland, the life of the people, and the cause of defending world peace from various perspectives.

In order to consolidate the achievements of mass song creation, improve the level of creation, and encourage creative practice, the Ministry and the Federation have jointly organized the mass song (including military song) awards for the past three years (October 1, 1949, to October 1, 1952), and organized a mass song awards committee to evaluate the mass songs across the country based on the ideological and artistic level of the works and their popularity among the masses, and decided on the list of works to be awarded. The list of award-winning songs has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry and the Federation, and it is considered that it should be promoted and introduced. In addition to publishing the "Award-Winning Mass Song Collection" and recommending the recording of records, it is hoped that professional and amateur music groups will adopt it and widely broadcast and teach it to the masses. The list of award-winning songs is now announced as follows.

    关于三年来全国群众歌曲评奖的公告
    自一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立以来，全国各地群众歌曲的创作活动是相当蓬勃的。在数量方面，几年来各地发表的群众歌曲不下万首。它们继承革命音乐的战斗传统，服从各个时期的政治任务，反映了国家的新面貌和人民的新生活，鼓舞了人民的斗争意志和劳动热情。
    过去群众歌曲创作的数量虽然很多，也产生了一些优秀的作品，但其中不少歌曲由于作者对现实生活缺乏深刻的感受，不能从生活出发来反映各个时期的政治任务，故常以空洞的政治口号和一般化的曲调来代替生动的艺术形象，缺乏深刻的思想感情和艺术感染力，因而不能起到应有的作用，为群众所传诵。今后应加强对群众歌曲创作的领导，丰富群众歌曲的题材和形式，从各个角度来反映祖国的社会主义建设、人民的生活和保卫世界和平的事业。
    为了巩固群众歌曲创作的成绩，提高创作水平，鼓励创作实践，本部、会特联合举办三年来
  （一九四九年十月一日至一九五二年十月一日）群众歌曲（包括部队歌曲）评奖，并组织群众歌曲评奖委员会，以作品的思想和艺术水平及在群众中流行的程度为衡量标准，将三年来全国的群众歌曲加以评选，并决定应予授奖的作品名单。此项授奖歌曲名单业经本部、会审定，并认为应予推广介绍，现除出版“评奖群众歌曲集”及推荐灌制唱片外，希各专业及业余音乐团体采用，向群众广为播唱、教唱。兹将授奖歌曲名单公布如后。
