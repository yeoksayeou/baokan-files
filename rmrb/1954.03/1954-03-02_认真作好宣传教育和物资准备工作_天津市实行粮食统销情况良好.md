    Conscientiously Carry Out Propaganda and Education and Material Preparation Work
    Tianjin City Implements Grain Unified Sales with Good Results
    Tianjin City successively began implementing planned supply of flour, rice, and coarse grains in November and December of last year. This measure not only more effectively guarantees the grain needs of the city's people but also ensures the stability of grain prices and general commodity prices. As a result, it has been warmly embraced by the vast majority of the city's people.
    The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government attach great importance to this work. In order to strengthen unified leadership of this work, temporary grain work offices were established from the city to the districts. Before the implementation of planned flour supply on November 1st of last year, the city extensively carried out propaganda on the policy of unified grain sales. In late October of last year, Huang Huoqing, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wu De, Mayor of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, delivered reports at meetings of party cadres and people's representatives from all walks of life in the city and districts. In the short span of two days, October 29th and 30th of last year, more than 2,000 report speakers were dispatched to deliver reports. More than 39,200 propagandists and activists participated in this propaganda work in the eight districts of the city and the Tanggu district. In the propaganda, the report speakers and propagandists generally combined the Party's general line for the transition period and adopted methods such as guiding recollection, comparing examples, and carefully calculating accounts, to explain in simple terms the political and economic significance of implementing planned grain supply, and explained the specific methods of planned supply. Except for a few streets and units where the reasons were not fully explained and a small number of people experienced some ideological fluctuations, the city's people were generally at peace and order was good.
    In order to ensure timely supply according to plan, state-owned grain companies and other business departments strengthened grain storage and transportation, processing, and grain variety adjustment work before and after the implementation of planned grain supply. At the same time, state-owned retail stores and cooperative sales outlets were appropriately increased, and the political and ideological work of these business departments was strengthened.
    Before the implementation of planned flour supply, the Tianjin Municipal Grain Office and relevant departments also conducted prior investigation and research on the grain consumption of people from all walks of life, as well as the basic situation of private grain businesses and flour food businesses, and then formulated specific methods for graded and quantitative supply according to the principle of "simplicity and ease of implementation." The supply standards appropriately took care of the working people and industrial workers. For foreign diplomatic personnel stationed in Tianjin, hospital patients, etc., all supplies were provided according to needs. For the flour needed by the cooked food industry and the food industry, the supply was generally based on the actual needs of September of last year. This ensured the normal operation of these industries.
    On the basis of the successful implementation of planned flour supply, Tianjin City also implemented planned supply of rice and coarse grains on December 1st. In order to comprehensively control the amount of grain sold and to facilitate citizens' purchase of grain, Tianjin City adopted the method of supplying rice and coarse grains with grain purchase booklets. Except for flour, there were no restrictions on the variety or quantity of other grains, but hoarding or resale was not allowed.
    When implementing planned grain supply, Tianjin City made appropriate arrangements for private grain businesses. On October 29th of last year, the industrial and commercial bureaus of the Tianjin municipal districts convened meetings of capitalists in the private grain and milling industries to announce the state's grain policy. The next day, they began to register their existing grain stocks with the government. During this period, some unscrupulous merchants attempted to conceal and transfer their grain stocks, but after government inspections and exposure by shop employees and the masses, most of them changed their attitudes. After the implementation of planned flour supply, some speculative merchants attempted to transport flour out of the city and illegally purchase rice, but they were cracked down upon by the government's investigation and the supervision of the masses. The business licenses of private grain wholesalers have been revoked. Those who request to change their profession are helped by the government. After review, some employees and individual capitalists are hired by the government. Private milling and grain retail businesses are mostly entrusted by the state grain departments to process and sell grain on their behalf. Generally, they can maintain their original business volume. For individual consignment shops with difficulties, the government also allows them to also sell some groceries, cigarettes, and other commodities. This has basically and smoothly brought the city's private grain milling and grain retail industries into the orbit of state capitalism.
    After the implementation of planned grain supply in Tianjin City, speculative grain merchants have no chance to take advantage of loopholes, grain sales have returned to normal, and grain prices have become more stable. At the same time, the state grain departments have guaranteed the grain needs of citizens with simple procedures. Therefore, the broad masses of people have expressed satisfaction. Many workers in cotton textile factories are also using corn flour instead of flour for sizing yarn in order to save flour. Workers and shop employees in private grain shops and milling businesses generally actively assist the government in educating and supervising capitalists to obey the leadership of the state-owned economy and do a good job in processing and consignment sales. Many family members of employees and housewives have also guaranteed to abide by the regulations on planned grain supply and pay attention to reporting illegal activities of grain merchants.

    认真作好宣传教育和物资准备工作
    天津市实行粮食统销情况良好
    天津市在去年十一月和十二月间，先后开始实行面粉和大米、粗粮的计划供应。这一措施，不仅更加有效地保障了全市人民的粮食需要，还保证了粮食价格和一般物价的平稳，因而受到全市广大人民的热烈拥护。
    中共天津市委会和天津市人民政府对这一工作极为重视。为了加强这一工作的统一领导，从市到区都设立了临时的粮食工作办公室。在去年十一月一日实行面粉计划供应以前，全市广泛开展了关于粮食统销政策的宣传。去年十月下旬，中共天津市委书记黄火青和天津市人民政府市长吴德先后在党内干部会和市、区各界人民代表会议上作了报告。在去年十月二十九日和三十日短短的两天时间内，全市两千多名报告员出动作了报告。市内八个区和塘沽区有三万九千二百多宣传员和群众积极分子参加了这一宣传工作。在宣传中，报告员和宣传员一般都结合国家过渡时期的总路线，采用引导回忆、举例对比和算细账等方法，通俗地说明了实行粮食计划供应的政治意义和经济意义，并交代了计划供应的具体办法。除个别街道和单位因为没有讲透道理，少数群众曾一度发生一些思想波动外，全市人心安定，秩序良好。
    为了保证按计划及时供应，在实行粮食计划供应前后，国营粮食公司等业务部门加强了粮食储运、加工工作和粮食品种的调剂工作；同时还适当增设了国营零售店和合作社分销处，并加强了这些业务部门的政治思想工作。
    在实行面粉计划供应以前，天津市粮食办公室和有关部门还事先调查研究了各界人民消费粮食的情况，以及私营粮食业、面食业等的基本情况，然后根据“简便易行”的原则具体制订了分等定量供应的办法。供应标准中适当照顾了劳动人民和产业工人；对于驻天津市的外交人员、医院病人等按需要全部供应。对于熟食业、食品工业需要的面粉，
  一般都按去年九月份实际需用量进行供应。这样就保证了这些行业的正常营业。
    在面粉计划供应胜利实施的基础上，天津市在十二月一日又实行了大米、粗粮的计划供应。为了全面地控制粮食销售量，并便于市民购买粮食，天津市对大米、粗粮采用了凭购粮摺供应的办法。除面粉外，其它粮食都不限品种，不限数量，但不得囤积或转售。
    天津市在实行粮食计划供应时，对私营粮食业进行了适当的处理。去年十月二十九日，天津市各区人民政府工商分局分别召集私营粮食业、磨坊业的资本家开会，宣布了国家的粮食政策。次日，即开始让他们向政府登记存粮数字。在这个期间有些奸商曾企图隐匿和转移存粮，经政府检查和店员群众揭发后，多已改变了态度。在实行面粉计划供应后，曾有部分投机奸商向市外偷运面粉和套购大米，在政府缉查和群众监督之下也被取缔。对于私营粮食批发商，已一律吊销其营业执照；对要求转业者，政府都设法予以帮助，有一部分职工及个别资本家，政府在审查后加以录用。私营磨坊业和粮食零售业，国家粮食部门多委托其加工和代销粮食。一般都能维持原来的营业额，个别有困难的代销店，政府也准许其兼营一部分杂货、纸烟等商品。这样就使全市私营粮食磨坊业和粮食零售业基本上顺利而妥善地纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。
    天津市实行粮食计划供应以后，投机粮商已无机可乘，粮食销售量已趋正常，粮价更形稳定，同时国家粮食部门用简便的手续保证了市民的粮食需要，因此，广大人民都表示满意。许多棉纺织厂的工人为了节约面粉，还改用玉米面代替面粉浆纱。私营粮店和磨坊业的工人、店员一般都积极协助政府教育和监督资本家服从国营经济的领导，作好加工和代销工作。许多职工家属、家庭妇女也保证要遵守粮食计划供应的规定，并注意检举粮商的不法活动。
