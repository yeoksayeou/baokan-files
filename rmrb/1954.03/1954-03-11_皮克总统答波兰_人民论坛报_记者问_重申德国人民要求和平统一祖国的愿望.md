Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 8th: President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, answered several questions raised by a reporter from the Polish "People's Tribune," emphasizing the German people's desire for peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the prevention of the revival of German militarism.

    In answering the question of what impact the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference would have on the struggle of peace-loving and patriotic forces in Germany for a peaceful solution to the German question, President Pieck said: "The Four Powers Conference illustrates that the Bonn and Paris war treaties are the main obstacles to the peaceful reunification of our country. It is impossible to imagine that Germany's neighbors and peace-loving Germans would tolerate the revival of the Wehrmacht under the command of former Hitler generals. It is also wrong to think that the working class of the German Democratic Republic would give up the tremendous political, social, and cultural achievements it has obtained and allow the restoration of the power of big monopoly capital and Junker landlords." Pieck emphasized that a unified Germany must be a democratic and peace-loving Germany, which should guarantee its citizens freedom, work, and bread, and guarantee peace for its neighbors. The proposals put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are to achieve such a goal. These proposals are arousing a rising patriotic movement in our people, especially because the Berlin Conference has once again shown that the solution of the German question is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves.

    Regarding the impact that the development of friendly relations between Germany and Poland can have on consolidating peace and security in Europe, Pieck said:
  "Encouraged by US imperialism, West German reactionary revanchist politicians and Hitler generals are openly threatening Germany's neighbors with aggression. Therefore, the existence of a state of workers and peasants on German territory, which resolutely fights against all war propaganda and is determined to stop German militarists from launching new aggression together with all peace-loving people in Europe, is particularly important for guaranteeing European peace. The new relationship between the German Democratic Republic and People's Poland proves that the most reliable guarantee of peace and security is the friendship between the people of all countries."

    皮克总统答波兰“人民论坛报”记者问
    重申德国人民要求和平统一祖国的愿望
    【新华社十日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林八日讯：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克回答了波兰“人民论坛报”记者提出的几个问题，强调德国人民要求和平统一祖国和制止德国军国主义复活的愿望。
    在回答柏林四国外长会议的结果对德国爱好和平的与爱国的力量为和平解决德国问题而进行的斗争有何影响的问题时，皮克总统说：“四大国会议说明，波恩和巴黎战争条约是和平地重新统一我们的国家的主要障碍。不可能想像德国的邻国以及爱好和平的德国人会容忍在前希特勒将领统率下的国防军复活。以为德意志民主共和国的工人阶级会放弃它所得到的巨大的政治、社会与文化方面的成就，而允许大垄断资本和容克地主的势力复辟，这也是错误的。”皮克着重指出：统一的德国必须是一个民主的与爱好和平的德国，这个德国应保证它的公民有自由、工作和面包，并保证它的邻国的和平。苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫所提出的建议就是为了达到这样的目标。这些建议正在我国人民中激起一个高涨的爱国运动，特别是因为柏林会议已经再一次说明，解决德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情。
    谈到德国与波兰之间友好关系的发展对于巩固欧洲的和平与安全可以产生的影响时，皮克说：
  “在美帝国主义的鼓励下，西德反动的复仇主义政客和希特勒将领们公开地给德国的邻国以侵略的威胁。因此，在德国领土上存在着一个工人与农民的国家，它坚决地为反对一切战争宣传而斗争，并与全欧洲爱好和平的人民在一起，决心制止德国军国主义分子进行新的侵略。这件事对于保障欧洲和平就尤其重要了。德意志民主共和国与人民波兰之间的新关系证明，和平与安全的最可靠的保证就是各国人民之间的友谊。”
