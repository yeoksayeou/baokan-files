    Veteran Workers of Tianjin Vehicle Depot Enthusiastically Train Apprentices
    In the Tianjin Vehicle Depot's train repair shop, many young workers, clad in greasy cotton clothes, clamber under trains, diligently inspecting train parts alongside the veteran workers they admire. After work, they gather around the veteran workers, asking questions and engaging in what seems like a technical discussion. Just last year, they were apprentices, unfamiliar with terms like axles, couplers, and brake beams, some having never even ridden a train. Over the past year, under the Party's education and with the help of veteran workers, they have come to understand the prospects of socialism, grasped their significant responsibilities, and diligently studied train repair techniques. One hundred and one apprentices have transformed into formal technical workers. Shi Shengming, a young third-grade technician, was a farmer's child just a year ago; now he is a skilled repairman. While it typically takes workers seven to eight minutes to replace a brake beam, he can do it in just three minutes. Once, he even managed it in one minute and forty seconds. This speed is unmatched by even some veteran workers. He is still working hard to delve deeper into technology, saying, "Our technical theory is not yet high; we are still far from the country's requirements. Recently, with the large volume of tasks and vehicles, we are not repairing them quickly enough, which is not good. We must study hard and improve our technical capabilities." Wang Ruiling, another young worker, couldn't even hold a hammer when he first arrived at the vehicle depot. Recently, he has become quite proficient. He can replace a brake beam in just three minutes and thirty seconds.
    The veteran workers of the Tianjin Vehicle Depot have made teaching apprentices a part of their job. They propose: to train apprentices well, improve technical standards, and realize socialist industrialization. In their work and during their spare time, they tirelessly pass on their skills to the new generation. Last year, they signed one hundred and seventeen mentor-apprentice contracts, guaranteeing to transform the apprentices into technicians. This guarantee has been largely realized. After the examinations, only eleven apprentices failed, while the rest became technicians. Veteran technician Zhao Baoping once taught nineteen apprentices the necessary skills in forty-five days. His apprentices not only understand general techniques but also master more than thirty advanced repair methods. Zhao Baoping never interrupted his apprentice-teaching work even during breaks. Some apprentices, worried about him getting tired, urged him to go home and rest, but he said, "I can't rest! Teaching you well also adds to the country's strength. Our workers' technical level is not high enough yet; we still need to catch up quickly!" Under his encouragement, veteran workers broke away from conservative thinking, and young workers increased their enthusiasm for learning technology. Some technical personnel also helped workers learn technology.
    This year, the Tianjin Vehicle Depot plans to train another one hundred and fifty apprentices to become formal technical workers. The Tianjin Vehicle Depot is also holding spare-time technical lectures to meet the workers' demands for learning technology. These important measures will open the door to strengthening railway transportation capabilities. (Chen Ji)

    天津车辆段老工人热心培养徒工
    天津车辆段列车检修所许多年轻工人，穿着油腻腻的棉衣，爬在列车底下，跟着为他们所敬爱的老工人，紧张地检查着列车的零件。一下了班，他们又都围着老工人，问长问短，好像在开技术讨论会。他们在去年还都是徒工，不懂得什么叫车轴、车钩和制动梁，有的人连火车也没坐过。去年一年，他们在党的教育和老工人的帮助下，认识了社会主义的前途，懂得了自己的重大责任，努力学习列车检修的技术。一百零一个徒工，变成了正式的技术工人。年轻的三级技工石胜明，一年以前还是农家的孩子；现在已是检修的能手。一般工人更换一根制动梁，都要七、八分钟；他只要三分钟。有一次，他只用了一分四十秒钟。这个速度，甚至有些老工人都达不到。现在他还在努力钻研技术，他说：“我们的技术理论还不高；距离国家的要求，还差得远。最近任务大，车辆多，我们修得不快，又不好。我们一定要好好学，提高技术能力。”年轻工人王瑞岺，刚来到车辆段，连铁锤也不会拿。最近他也成了一把好手。他更换制动梁，也只用三分三十秒钟。
    天津车辆段的老工人，已经把教好徒工，当作自己工作的一部分。他们提出：教好徒工，提高技术水平，实现社会主义工业化。他们在工作中，在业余时间里，不知疲倦地把技术传授给新的一代。去年他们和徒工订了一百十七个师徒合同，保证把徒工变成技工。这个保证已基本上实现了。经过考试，只有十一个徒工不及格，其余的都成了技工。老技工赵宝萍在四十五天内，曾经教会了十九名徒工的技术。他的徒工，不但懂得一般的技术，而且能掌握三十多种先进的检修方法。赵宝萍在歇班的时候，也从来没有间断过教徒工的工作。有些徒工怕他累了，要他回家休息，他说：“不能休息！教好你们，也增加了国家一份力量。咱们工人技术水平还不够，还要赶快赶啊！”在他的鼓舞下，老工人打破了保守思想，年轻工人提高了学习技术的热情。有些技术人员也帮助工人学习技术。
    今年，天津车辆段还要培养一百五十名徒工，成为正式的技术工人。天津车辆段还举办业余技术讲座，来满足工人学习技术的要求。这些重要措施，将为增强铁路运输力量打开大门。　（陈迹）
