    Central Meteorological Observatory and Central People's Broadcasting Station
    Decide to Strengthen Broadcasting of Disaster Weather Forecasts and Warnings
    Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: In accordance with the State Council of the Central People's Government's "Instructions on Strengthening the Forecasting, Warning, and Prevention of Disastrous Weather," the Central Meteorological Observatory and the Central People's Broadcasting Station have decided to strengthen the broadcasting of disaster weather forecasts and warnings. The content of the broadcasts includes: cold waves, gales, and frosts affecting areas in more than two major regions, and typhoons affecting China's coastal areas and nearby waters, as well as rainstorms (snow) caused by typhoons and cold waves. Forecasts and warnings of particularly serious disastrous weather, even if the affected area is not in more than two major regions, will also be broadcast.
    In order to facilitate the reception of disaster weather forecasts and warnings by all parties, the Central People's Broadcasting Station will, starting immediately, broadcast such news in three fixed programs. The times for these three programs are: the news programs from 6:40 to 7:00 and from 12:30 to 12:50, and the national joint broadcast program of local people's broadcasting stations from 20:30 to 21:00. In the event of particularly urgent or serious disaster weather warnings, in addition to broadcasting at the above fixed times, they will be broadcast in other programs at any time. It is hoped that government departments at all levels, especially industrial, agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, shipping, railway, fisheries, animal husbandry, and salt industry departments, as well as local radio stations, will pay attention to listening and copying these broadcasts, so that all localities can prepare early and prevent and reduce the losses of people's lives and property and state assets.
