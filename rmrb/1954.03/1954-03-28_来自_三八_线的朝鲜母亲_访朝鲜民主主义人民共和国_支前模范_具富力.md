    A typical image of a Korean mother shines in my mind: a kind and amiable face, a firm and gentle expression, a warm smile often appearing on her face when she speaks. And also, the trembling of her silver-gray long skirt, revealing her steady pace. She is Gu Fuli, who organized the women of the whole village to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army during the war. She is Gu Fuli, who took up the stretcher after her husband's sacrifice and transported the wounded, braving the artillery fire, and thus won the title of "Model of Supporting the Front" of the Republic.

    Now, she has come to China as a member of the Korean People's Visiting Delegation.

    Stand Up, Fight On

    At dawn on October 28, 1951, six enemy planes suddenly appeared over Xin Fengli, Changdao County, Gangwon Province, near the 38th Parallel, bombing and strafing this peaceful village. A bomb landed right on the roof of Gu Fuli's house. Smoke billowed everywhere, and flames soared into the sky. Crowds of people came from all directions to put out the fire. Among them were four Chinese People’s Volunteer Army soldiers in yellow uniforms who plunged into Gu Fuli's house, which was surrounded by thick smoke and raging fire, without regard for their own safety. Their clothes were burned, their hands were scorched, and their bodies were injured by falling wood, bricks, and tiles. They forgot all the dangers and only thought about how to quickly rescue this family, how to rescue these people who usually loved and supported them. However, Gu Fuli's twelve-year-old child, Jin Shuilong, seven-year-old child, Jin Hailong, and three-year-old child, Jin Erlong, were forever separated from their parents. Jin Erlong died in Gu Fuli's arms, resting on his mother's arm. The child's blood splattered on the mother's body, staining her white skirt red. Gu Fuli, her husband, and the remaining three children did not wake up until much later. Looking at everything around them and listening to others describing the scene at the time, tears streamed from the corners of these strong people's eyes. These were tears of gratitude, tears of revenge! Gu Fuli said to her husband, Jin Fuhuan: "The Volunteer Army comrades saved us, we must organize and continue to fight!"

    Soon, the Xin Fengli stretcher team led by Jin Fuhuan was organized. Gu Fuli's eldest child, Jin Jilong, also went to the People's Army to be a signalman. Gu Fuli herself also organized the women of the whole village to more actively support the front line.

    Husband Gloriously Sacrificed to Protect the Wounded

    In mid-July 1953, the sound of artillery fire from the counterattack south of Jin Cheng shook the valleys of Korea. The heroic image of Martyr Park Jae-geun, who died in the Battle of Shangganling in November 1952, inspired the Korean people to support the war regardless of their personal safety. Jin Fuhuan, who had been tested by many battles, led the stretcher team and set off again. The 105-member women's hygiene team, the 70-member women's blood transfusion team, the 5-member women's catering team...organized by Gu Fuli, except for a few who stayed in the rear hospital, all went to the front lines.

    Three days later, Gu Fuli was transferred back to the rear due to work needs, responsible for settling and taking care of the wounded.

    On July 17, when Gu Fuli had completed the task of organizing women to settle the wounded and was preparing to set off to the front line, an unfortunate thing happened: four Volunteer Army soldiers walked into the village with great sorrow, carrying a stretcher. On the stretcher lay a corpse dressed in a brand new military uniform, with a red cloth covering the face. Gu Fuli's husband, Jin Fuhuan, had sacrificed himself.

    The incident happened when the counterattack south of Jin Cheng was nearing its end. The enemy launched a frenzied counterattack on Yuefeng Mountain. Jin Fuhuan and four others carried a wounded Volunteer Army soldier to the rear overnight, using the light of the enemy's flares to cross several mountains. At dawn, enemy planes came again. They hid the wounded soldier in a gully behind Jiaoyan Mountain, carefully observing the movements of the enemy planes. At this moment, they suddenly heard the whooshing sound of a bomb falling. Based on his experience, Jin Fuhuan determined that the bomb would explode near them. It was too late to hide the wounded soldier again. He said to the stretcher bearers around him: "I would rather sacrifice myself than let the Volunteer Army soldier be injured again!" So he immediately lay on top of the wounded soldier. At the same time, two bombs exploded ten meters away from him. Shrapnel hit his back and head, and blood stained the nearby land and flowed on the wounded soldier's body. Jin Fuhuan protected the safety of the Volunteer Army soldier with his life.

    Gu Fuli looked at her husband's body, suppressed her grief, and said firmly: For us, the Volunteer Army comrades shed so much blood, and it is also glorious that my husband died to protect the Volunteer Army soldier! She and the Volunteer Army buried her husband at the foot of Shishan Mountain near Xin Fengli.

      Taking Up the Stretcher in Place of Her Husband

    Gu Fuli, this strong Korean mother, buried her husband's body, wiped away her tears, and set off for the front line again the next day. She took up the stretcher in place of her husband, braving the enemy's artillery fire, stepping on the muddy road, crossing mountains and ridges, transporting the wounded day and night. Once, she fainted and broke her forehead. After waking up, she continued to carry the stretcher forward until all the artillery fire in Korea ceased.

      Rebuilding Their Homeland

    After the artillery fire stopped, the women of Xin Fengli quickly emerged from the mountain caves, filled the bomb craters in the fields, cleared the ruins left by the war, and began to rebuild their homes. Gu Fuli organized 109 women, divided them into 12 classes according to their labor force, braved the severe winter, accumulated fertilizer, selected seeds, and strived for the first harvest after the war. She herself planted 1,200 ping (approximately 202 ping is equal to one Chinese mu) of paddy fields and 4,000 ping of dry land. To support the reconstruction of the Republic, she overpaid more than 200 catties of public grain last year, and she will strive to pay more public grain this year. Before she came to China this time, she had prepared this year's production plan. The plan: plant 1,000 ping of millet, producing two dan. Plant 1,000 ping of cabbage and potatoes, harvest 20,000 catties of cabbage and 3,180 catties of potatoes, and plant 1,000 ping of beans, harvesting a total of six dan. The rest is prepared to plant rice, striving to harvest 15 dan. Finally, she excitedly told the reporter: "After returning to China this time, the houses in our village will be rebuilt!"

    At this time, I looked again at the two medals on her chest. The glory of the medals will forever illuminate the fighting friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea. (Attached picture)

    来自“三八”线的朝鲜母亲
    ——访朝鲜民主主义人民共和国“支前模范”具富力
　  长荣
    一个朝鲜母亲的典型形象，在我的脑海里闪耀着：善良亲切的面孔，坚毅和蔼的表情，说起话来，脸上经常浮现着热情洋溢的笑容。还有，随着她那稳健步法而显示出来的银灰色长裙的颤动。她就是在战争中组织了全里妇女支援志愿军的具富力，她就是在丈夫牺牲以后代替丈夫抬起担架冒着炮火转运伤员，因而获得了共和国“支前模范”称号的具富力。
    现在，她作为朝鲜人民访华代表团的团员来中国访问了。
    站起来，战斗下去
    一九五一年十月二十八日的拂晓，临近“三八”线的江原道昌道郡新丰里的上空，突然窜来了六架敌机，对着这个和平村庄轰炸和扫射。一颗炸弹正落在具富力家的房顶上。一时硝烟四起，火光烛天，救火的人群从四面八方涌来。其中有四个穿着黄色军服的志愿军战士，奋不顾身地扑进被浓烟烈火包围了的具富力的房子。他们的衣服被烧毁了，手被烧破了，身上被落下来的木头砖瓦打伤了。他们忘掉了一切危险，只想着如何快快地把这一家人抢救出来，把这些平时热爱和支援自己的人们抢救出来。可是，具富力十二岁的孩子金水龙、七岁的孩子金海龙、三岁的孩子金二龙，却都和他们的父母永别了。金二龙临死前还躺在具富力的怀里，枕着母亲的臂膀。孩子的鲜血溅在母亲的身上，染红了母亲的白裙。具富力和她的丈夫还有其余三个孩子过了好久才苏醒过来。他们看着周围的一切，听着别人给他们谈述着当时的情景，泪水从这些坚强人们的眼角中淌了出来。这是感激的眼泪，复仇的眼泪！具富力对丈夫金福焕说：“志愿军同志救了咱们，我们要组织起来，继续战斗下去！”
    很快，由金福焕带领的新丰里担架队组织起来了。具富力的大孩子金基龙也到人民军中去做通讯员了。具富力自己，也把全里的妇女组织起来，更积极地支援着前线。
    为了掩护伤员，丈夫光荣牺牲
    一九五三年七月中旬，金城以南反击战的炮声，震撼了朝鲜的山谷。一九五二年十一月上甘岭战役中牺牲的朴在根烈士的英雄形象，鼓舞着朝鲜人民奋不顾身地支援战争。经过多次战火考验的金福焕带领的担架队又出发了。具富力组织的一百零五名的妇女卫生队、七十名的妇女输血队、五名的妇女伙食班……，除了少数留在后方医院外，都开到前沿阵地去了。
    三天以后，因为工作需要，具富力被调回后方，负责安置和照顾伤员。
    七月十七日，具富力在完成了组织妇女安置伤员的任务又准备出发到前沿阵地去的时候，不幸的事情发生了：四个志愿军战士带着极大的哀伤抬着一副担架走进村子来，担架上躺着一具身穿崭新的军服的尸体，脸上盖着红布，具富力的丈夫金福焕牺牲了。
    事情发生在金城以南反击战接近尾声的时候。敌人对月烽山发动了疯狂的反扑，金福焕等四个人抬着一个志愿军伤员连夜向后方转运，他们借着敌人照明弹的光亮，越过了好几座大山。天刚亮，敌机又来了。他们把伤员隐蔽在轿岩山侧后的一个山沟里，仔细观测着敌机的去向。这时，突然听到炸弹落下的飕飕的声音。根据自己的经验，金福焕断定炸弹一定要在他们附近爆炸。重新隐蔽伤员已经来不及了。他对周围的担架队员说：“宁肯牺牲我自己，也不能让志愿军伤员再负一次伤！”于是他立即伏在伤员的身上。同时两颗炸弹在距他十公尺的地方爆炸了。弹片打进了他的背上，头上，鲜血染红了附近的土地，也流在那个伤员的身上，金福焕用自己的生命保护了那个志愿军伤员的安全。
    具富力看着丈夫的尸体抑制住自己的悲痛，坚强地说：为了我们，志愿军同志流了多少鲜血，我的丈夫为了保护志愿军伤员死了也是光荣的！她和志愿军一块，把丈夫安葬在新丰里附近的石山麓下。
      代替丈夫抬起担架
    具富力，这个坚强的朝鲜母亲，埋好了丈夫的尸体，擦干了眼泪，第二天，又出发到前线去了。她代替自己的丈夫抬起了担架，冒着敌人的炮火，踏着泥泞的道路，翻山越岭，不分昼夜地转送伤员。有一次，她昏倒了，前额也跌破了，苏醒过来后，仍然抬着担架前进。一直到朝鲜的炮火全部停息下来。
      重建起自己的家园
    炮火停息以后，新丰里的妇女，很快就走出了山洞，填平了田野中的弹坑，清除了战争遗留下来的废墟，开始重建自己的家园。具富力组织了一百零九名妇女，按劳动力的强弱，分成十二个班，冒着冬天的严寒，积肥料、选种子，争取战后的第一次丰收。她自己种着一千二百坪（约二百○二坪等于中国一市亩）水田，四千坪旱田，为了支援共和国的重建，去年她多缴了二百多斤公粮，今年她要争取缴更多的公粮。这次，她到中国来访问以前，就做好了今年的生产计划。计划：种谷子一千坪，产两石。白菜、土豆一千坪，白菜收两万斤，土豆收三千一百八十斤，豆子一千坪，共收六石。其余都准备种稻子，争取收十五石。最后她对记者兴奋地说：“这次回国以后，我们里的房子都会重建起来的！”
    这时，我又看了一下她胸前挂着的两枚功勋章，功勋章的光辉将永远照耀着中朝两国人民用鲜血结成的战斗友谊。（附图片）
