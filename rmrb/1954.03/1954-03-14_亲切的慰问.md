Cordial Greetings
    Wu Yubing

    Shanghai—Anshan, are two magnificent industrial cities in the south and north of the motherland. The great construction cause of socialist industrialization closely links them together.

    In late February, the delegation from Anshan Iron and Steel Company came to Shanghai to express their regards to the Shanghai workers who participated in supporting the "Ansteel" three major projects—the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace. The delegation met with more than 400 advanced workers from dozens of public and private factories in Shanghai, and personally visited more than a dozen factories and enterprises to express their regards. The Shanghai workers were honored to receive the greetings from the Ansteel representatives. They hung the banners presented by the representatives in their factory auditoriums or workshops, treating them as "mirrors" to examine their future production and whether they had made their utmost efforts to support Ansteel and basic construction across the country.

    When the Ansteel delegation arrived in Shanghai, people recalled many past events. Although Shanghai is a relatively concentrated industrial city in China, the long-term aggression of the imperialists resulted in a lack of steel, making it feel like a lame person suffering from paralysis. Until the first half of 1953, the Shanghai Boiler Factory had to manufacture extremely old-fashioned boilers that were bulky, occupied a large area, and consumed a lot of coal due to the lack of seamless steel tubes. Wang Wenkui, the deputy director of the factory, said: "In the past, we eagerly awaited seamless steel tubes, and now we have finally received them." The seamless steel tubes from Ansteel have now been made into boilers. The quality of the steel tubes has undergone various strict tests such as "cold hammering," "flange bending," and "cold flattening (pressing the tube walls together)," proving that they neither crack nor "peel." Zhang Songlin, an old worker who has been a boiler worker for more than 30 years, was so excited that tears filled his eyes when he used such good steel tubes made by Chinese workers themselves for the first time. A large number of steel plates from Ansteel are being used by the workers of the China Shipbuilding Factory to assemble the largest passenger-cargo ship that the factory has ever built in its 27 years of establishment. This ship will soon be full of passengers, safely transporting them to various construction posts in the motherland. Steel ingots from Ansteel have been manufactured into diesel engines by the workers of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory to support basic construction. These are just the beginning. An Ansteel representative excitedly told the Shanghai workers: "In the future, Ansteel will provide us with a lot of steel for manufacturing trains, cars, ships, and tractors."

    During the most intense period of construction of the three major projects of Ansteel—the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace—more than 100 public and private factories in Shanghai manufactured more than 1,000 tons of various mechanical and electrical equipment for Ansteel. The Shanghai Wire Factory alone manufactured more than 360,000 meters of cables and wires for Ansteel, and the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory manufactured more than 460 different specifications of universal conversion control switches for Ansteel. The workers knew that time was precious at Ansteel, and any delay would cause significant losses to national wealth. In the Shanghai Wire Factory, those responsible for planning in the manufacture of cables and wires separately compiled a plan for the entire production process of Ansteel products, from when they were put into production to when they were finished, in order to grasp the time of delivery. The workers added red marks to Ansteel's orders, so that the workers in each process could pay attention to rushing the production of Ansteel's orders ahead of schedule. The cables ordered by Ansteel in September last year were originally scheduled for delivery at the end of September. Due to the fast progress of the Ansteel project, the delivery was changed to September 20th. At this critical juncture, one of the lead pressing machines in the lead pressing team broke down. The workshop director led the workers to repair it all night long. The next day was the Mid-Autumn Festival, but the workers did not rest and finally ensured that the task was completed on schedule. On September 18th last year, the workers of the Xincheng Electric Motor Factory received an order for two flow recorders from Ansteel. According to the past production situation of the factory, they could only produce one to three units per month. In order to ensure that the Ansteel project was not affected, the workers often completed three days of work in one day, and completed all the tasks ahead of schedule on the 28th. The verification was carried out that night. It was already past get off work time, but many workers automatically waited in the factory to prevent problems from being found in the verification, and only left the factory with peace of mind after the verification was completed.

    In those days, under the slogan of "Supporting Ansteel is supporting the whole country," people had a common sense of responsibility. Even if they did not have direct support tasks, as long as Ansteel needed them, they would go all out. The Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard did not have any orders with Ansteel, but when they heard that the No. 7 blast furnace urgently needed a batch of Soviet-made welding rods, they gave all of the factory's only seven tons of Soviet-made welding rods to Ansteel. The Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant, upon hearing that the No. 7 furnace needed two "high-pressure steam valves," from the factory director to the workers, helped to find them together. From the large warehouse, the small warehouse, to the workshop warehouse, they finally found two and gave them to Ansteel. These powerfully supported the construction of Ansteel's three major projects. As Comrade Wen Liangxian, the head of the Ansteel delegation, said: The early completion and entry into production of the three major projects are inseparable from the strong support of the Shanghai workers.

    The completion of Ansteel's three major projects is only a part of the entire Ansteel construction project, and more projects are waiting to be built. In order to continue to support Ansteel, the workers of various factories in Shanghai have put forward strong guarantees. In just a few days that the representatives were in Shanghai, the representatives received many letters from the workers of various factories. The workers of the Shanghai Wire Factory proposed to guarantee that they would deliver the best wires and cables to Ansteel in the future, and the workers of the Huatong Switch Factory guaranteed that they would deliver the goods without delay. The workers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau told the Ansteel representatives: "Please tell all the comrades of Ansteel that we guarantee to deliver the goods to Anshan quickly, safely and on time."

    亲切的慰问
    吴于冰
    上海——鞍山，是祖国南方和北方的两座雄伟的工业城市，社会主义工业化的伟大建设事业，把它们紧密地联结在一起。
    二月下旬，鞍山钢铁公司的代表团，前来上海慰问参加支援“鞍钢”三大工程——大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号炼铁炉建设的上海工人们。代表团和上海数十家公、私营工厂的四百多名先进职工见了面，并亲自到了十几家工厂、企业进行了慰问；上海工人们都以能得到鞍钢代表们的慰问为荣，他们把代表们赠给的锦旗挂在自己工厂礼堂或车间里，把它当成“一面镜子”，用来检查自己今后的生产，检查对鞍钢以及全国各地基本建设的支援，是否尽到了最大的努力。
    鞍钢代表团到达上海的时候，人们会想起很多往事。上海虽然是中国工业比较集中的城市，但由于帝国主义者长期侵略的结果，缺乏钢铁，使人感到它像是患了瘫痪病的瘸子。直到一九五三年的上半年，上海锅炉厂由于缺无缝钢管，不得不制造又笨重，占地面积又大，耗煤又多的极老式的锅炉。该厂副厂长王文奎说：“在过去我们都眼巴巴地盼望无缝钢管，如今可真的盼到了。”来自鞍钢的无缝钢管，现在已制成了锅炉。钢管的质量经过“冷打”、“扳边”、“冷压扁（压到管壁合在一起）”等种种严格的考验，证明既不发生裂痕，也不“跷皮”。作了三十多年锅炉工的老工人张松林，第一次用到中国工人自己制造这样好的钢管时，激动得热泪盈眶。来自鞍钢的大批钢板，正被中华造船厂的工人用来装制该厂成立二十七年以来从未造过的、最大的一只客货船，这只船不久就将满载着乘客，把他们平安地送到祖国各个建设岗位上。来自鞍钢的钢锭，已在上海汽轮机厂的工人们手里制造柴油机，用来支援基本建设。这些还只不过是刚刚开始，一位鞍钢代表兴奋地告诉上海工人说：“今后鞍钢还会给我们制造火车、汽车、轮船、拖拉机的许多钢材呢。”
    鞍钢三大工程——大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号炼铁炉兴建最紧张的时候，上海一百多个公私营工厂为鞍钢制造了一千多吨各种机械、电器设备。仅上海电线厂为鞍钢制造的电缆、电线即长达三十六万多公尺，上海华通开关厂为鞍钢制造了各种不同规格的万能转换控制开关四百六十多种。工人们都知道在鞍钢的时间是宝贵的，多迟误一天，都会给国家财富造成重大的损失。上海电线厂在制造电缆、电线中，担任计划工作的就把鞍钢的产品，从何时投入生产到何时出成品整个生产过程单独编成计划，以便掌握出厂的时间，工人们就把鞍钢的订货加上红色记号，使每个工序的工人都能注意把鞍钢的订货提前赶制。去年九月份为鞍钢订制的电缆，原订九月底交货，由于鞍钢工程进度快，改为提前到九月二十日完成，正在这个紧急关头，压制电缆的压铅组机器坏了一部，车间主任领导着工人整整修了一夜，第二天正逢中秋节，工人们也不休息，终于保证了任务按期完成。去年九月十八日新成电机厂的工人们接到鞍钢两台流量纪录仪的订货，按照过去该厂生产情况，每月只能生产一至三台，工人们为了保证不影响鞍钢的工程，常常把三天的工作一天做完，在二十八日即提前完成全部任务；当天晚上即进行校验，本来已经过了下班时间，但很多工人为了预防在校验中发现问题，都自动等在厂里，直到校验完毕，才放心离开工厂。
    在那些日子里，在“支援鞍钢，就是支援全国”的口号下，人们都有一个共同的责任感，即使他们没有直接支援的任务，只要鞍钢有需要他们的地方，他们也都同样会全力以赴。上海江南造船所，本来与鞍钢没有订货任务，但当他们听到七号炼铁炉急要一批苏联制电焊条的时候，他们就把全厂仅有的七吨多苏联制电焊条全部交给了鞍钢。上海电力公司发电厂，听到七号炉需要两只“高压汽门”，从厂长到工人都一起帮助寻找，由大仓库、小仓库直到车间仓库，终于找到了两只，给了鞍钢。这些都有力地支援了鞍钢三大工程的建设。正如鞍钢代表团团长温良贤同志说的：三大工程的提前竣工进入生产，是与上海工人们的大力支援分不开的。
    鞍钢三大工程的完工，仅只是整个鞍钢建设工程的一部分，更多的工程还在等待着建设。为了继续支援鞍钢，上海各厂工人都提出了有力的保证，仅在代表们来上海的几天里，代表们就收到各厂工人的许多来信。上海电线厂的工人们提出今后保证做最好的电线电缆交给鞍钢，华通开关厂的工人保证不脱期交货。上海铁路局的工人们告诉鞍钢代表们说：“请你们转告鞍钢的全体同志，我们保证把货物又快、又安全按期送到鞍山”。
