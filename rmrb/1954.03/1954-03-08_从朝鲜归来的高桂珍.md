    Gao Guizhen, the wife of the heroic Volunteer Army soldier Dong Shigui, a model worker who enjoys preferential treatment, and a good daughter of the people, went to Korea in October 1953 from her hometown—Henan Village, Shunyi County, Hebei Province—carrying the warm entrustment of the people of the motherland to visit the most beloved people; to encourage them to more vigilantly defend the motherland's safe construction and the people's happy life. In December, she returned to the motherland with the hopes and demands of the thousands upon thousands of the most beloved people for the people of the motherland, conveying them to the people of the motherland.

    She actively participated in activities to report to the people. From January 19th to February 16th, 1954, she traveled from the industrial city of Tangshan to Wugong Village in Raoyang County, where the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative is located; from Shijiazhuang, the central area of Hebei Province, to Zhangjiakou, a famous city in the border area, traveling more than four thousand miles, and gave more than twenty reports to workers, farmers, students, and state employees, with a direct audience of more than 40,000 people. Many people considered it an honor to hear her report. At the report meeting in Shijiazhuang, notes requesting her to give another report were constantly sent to the stage. After she finished her report, an old lady in her sixties squeezed to the side of the car and held her hand tightly, saying, "I am also a military dependent, I will definitely learn from you, work hard to produce, and write to my son, telling him to be vigilant and defend our country."

    During her reports to the people, she and the model workers in industry and agriculture encouraged each other to work hard to increase production and accelerate socialist construction. In Tangshan, she visited the steel factory and the Huaxin Textile Factory. Seeing the huge machines humming and spinning, seeing a textile worker working diligently with hundreds of spindles, she felt that her own work was still not enough. She tightly held the hand of Liu Yuhua, a female model worker, and pointed to her blue twill uniform, saying, "You have worked hard. Without you, we wouldn't be able to wear such good cloth." Liu Yuhua said, "Without you planting cotton, we wouldn't be able to spin yarn and weave cloth." Finally, they jointly stated: Without the most beloved people defending our country, there would be no production and construction; we must work hard to increase production, and use practical actions to support the country's socialist industrialization to answer their hopes and demands. After reporting to all members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative and farmers in nearby villages in Wugong Village, the majority of farmers expressed that they would support the country's large-scale economic construction with actions of producing more grain and cotton. Li Hengtong (military dependent), a 69-year-old member, told her that he wanted to make a "Love the Cooperative Pact," accumulate more fertilizer for the cooperative, take good care of the cooperative's public property and farm tools, and guarantee participation in one hundred and fifty workdays throughout the year.

    Gao Guizhen's resounding name and the heroic deeds of the most beloved people she conveyed to the people gave people great encouragement. Workers, students, state employees, and People's Liberation Army soldiers from the northernmost Heilongjiang Province to the southernmost Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces sent letters to her. Gao Shiming and Wang Wensheng, five students from the Hebei Provincial Tongxian Normal School, said in a joint letter to her: "You are an excellent daughter of the motherland, setting a glorious example for us young people. We use your exemplary deeds as our driving force." And expressed: To study hard, exercise, and prepare to be a qualified people's teacher. Ge Shaozhen, a female worker in the roving workshop of the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, wrote to her, expressing that she would improve production efficiency, strive to overfulfill the production tasks assigned by the state, and struggle for the realization of a socialist society. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in various places wrote to her, expressing their determination to defend the motherland.

    The broad masses of the people expressed their determination to build socialism to her, which made her realize even more the importance of her own responsibility. She is determined to lead the broad masses of farmers on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation with her own practical actions. She has signed up to join the agricultural production cooperative that has just been established in her village, and has unified Dong's land and her mother's family's land into the cooperative. In addition to the general land being managed by the cooperative, she is determined to increase the production of the two mu and eight fen of wheat that was already planted last year by 10% to 50%. She wants to strive to "go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao for the second time" with practical production results. She is determined to be a tractor driver. In February, when she met with Geng Changsuo, she sat on the brand-new tractor and asked the driver to explain the performance of the brake, handle, steering wheel and other parts. She expressed that she would further improve herself under the leadership of the Party. Now, she has been converted from an alternate member of the Communist Party of China to a full member. She said: "In the future, I will gain greater forward power."

    从朝鲜归来的高桂珍
    新华社记者　谷克东
    高桂珍，英雄的志愿军战士董世贵的爱人，优抚、劳动模范，人民的好女儿，在一九五三年十月间，她从自己的家乡——河北省顺义县河南村，带着祖国人民热情的嘱托到朝鲜慰问了最可爱的人；鼓舞他们更警惕地保卫着祖国安全建设和人民的幸福生活。十二月间她带着千千万万的最可爱的人对祖国人民的希望和要求回到祖国，传达给祖国人民。
    她积极地参加了向人民作传达报告的活动。从一九五四年一月十九日到二月十六日，她从工业城市唐山到耿长锁农业生产合作社所在地饶阳县五公村；从河北省中心地区石家庄到塞上名城张家口，往返四千多里，向广大工人、农民、学生、国家工作人员先后作报告二十多次，直接听众四万多人。许多人以能听到她的报告为荣幸。在石家庄市的报告大会上，要求她再作报告的纸条不断的送到台上。当她报告结束后，一个六十多岁的老太太挤到汽车旁紧紧地拉住她的手说：“我也是军属，一定向你学习，努力生产，给儿子写信，叫他提高警惕，保卫咱们的国家。”
    她向人民作传达报告期间，还和工、农业劳动模范互以努力增产，加速社会主义建设相鼓励。在唐山，她参观了钢厂、华新纺织厂，她看到巨大的机器轰轰地转动，她看到一个纺织工人看几百支纱锭紧张地工作，感到自己的工作还很不够，她紧紧地握住妇女劳动模范刘玉花的手，指着自己的蓝斜纹制服说：“你们辛苦了，没有你们，我们穿不上这样好的布。”刘玉花说：“没有你们种棉花，我们纺不出线，织不成布。”最后她们共同表示：没有最可爱的人保卫咱们的国家，就不能生产建设；我们一定要努力增产，用支持国家的社会主义工业化的实际行动，回答他们的希望和要求。在五公村向耿长锁农业生产合作社全体社员和附近村农民报告后，广大农民表示要以多产粮、棉的行动，支持国家大规模的经济建设。六十九岁的社员李亨通（军属）对她说，他要订一个“爱社公约”，多给社里积肥，保管好社里的公共财产和农具，保证全年参加一百五十个劳动日。
    高桂珍这个响亮的名字和她传达给人民的最可爱的人的英雄事迹，给予人们莫大的鼓舞，工人、学生、国家工作人员、人民解放军战士从最北方的黑龙江省到最南方的云南、广西各地都寄信给她。河北省立通县师范高士明、王文生等五个同学联名给她的信说：“你是祖国的优秀儿女，给我们青年树立了一个光辉的榜样，我们以你的模范事迹，作为我们前进的力量。”并表示：要努力学习，锻炼身体，准备着做一个合格的人民教师。唐山华新纺织厂粗纱车间女工葛绍珍写信给她，表示要提高生产效率，争取超额完成国家给的生产任务，为实现社会主义社会而奋斗。各地的解放军战士给她写信，表示保卫祖国的决心。
    广大人民纷纷向她表示建设社会主义的决心，使她更加体会到自己责任的重大，她决心要以自己的实际行动，带领广大农民走互助合作的道路。她已报名加入本村刚成立起来的农业生产合作社，并把董家的土地和她娘家的土地统一入了社。除一般土地由社里统一经营外，并决心把去年已经种好的二亩八分小麦，增产百分之十到五十。她要以生产的实际成绩争取“第二次到北京去见毛主席”。她立志要当一个拖拉机手。二月间和耿长锁会见时，她坐到崭新的拖拉机上，要司机给她讲解挂闸、搬闸、方向盘等机件的性能。她表示要在党的领导下，更进一步的提高自己。现在，她已由中国共产党候补党员转为正式党员了，她说：“今后我将要得到更大的前进力量。”
