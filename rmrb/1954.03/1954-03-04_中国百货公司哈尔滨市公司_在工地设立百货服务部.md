    China Department Store Harbin City Company
    Establishes Department Store Service Department at Construction Sites

    In order to meet the needs of the staff of basic construction departments for daily necessities, starting from April of last year, the China Department Store Harbin City Company established department store service departments at four key construction sites including Pingfang, Wenmiao, the No. 4 Electric Factory, and large-scale construction sites. It also organized mobile service teams to regularly sell goods to the Huangshanzuizi construction site and the Harbin Institute of Technology dormitory construction site. Last year, the total supply of daily necessities such as clothing, shoes, hats, bedding, blankets, and towels was nearly 15 billion yuan. At the same time, it supplied 24 categories and more than 60 kinds of safety products needed to ensure safe production, such as safety helmets, gas masks, and work clothes. The value of these safety products was 40 billion yuan. These efforts have played a certain role in ensuring the completion of basic construction projects and various construction tasks.

    In order to further understand the needs of basic construction workers, the employees of the Harbin City Department Store conducted in-depth investigations into construction sites during the first quarter of this year to understand the construction area, the number of employees, and the styles, specifications, quality, colors, and prices of the required commodities, so as to gradually achieve planned supply. Since the beginning of February, the employees of the Harbin City Department Store have concentrated the safety products scattered in various stores and specially established a basic construction service department in the Tenth Store. According to the requirements of various basic construction, factory and mining, forestry, railway, transportation, and other units, they adopted the method of processing and ordering goods, signing contracts with both parties, and organizing timely supply. At the same time, the Tenth Store also has a reception room and a sample room to facilitate the purchase and ordering of goods by various units.

    中国百货公司哈尔滨市公司
    在工地设立百货服务部
    为满足基本建设部门职工生活必需品的供应，从去年四月份开始，中国百货公司哈尔滨市公司在平坊、文庙、电工四厂和大型工地等四处重点工地设立百货服务部，并组织流动服务组定期到黄山嘴子工地和哈尔滨工业大学宿舍工地卖货。去年全年供应服装、鞋帽、被褥、毯子、毛巾等日用必需品将近一百五十亿元。同时供应保证安全生产所需要的安全帽、防毒面具、作业服等二十四类六十多种保安用品，这些保安用品价值四百亿元。在保证完成基本建设工程和各项建设任务中，起到一定作用。
    为了进一步了解基本建设工人的需要，哈尔滨市百货公司职工在今年第一季度深入工地了解施工面积、职工人数、及所需商品的样式、规格、质量、色泽和价格，以逐步作到计划供应。自二月初开始，哈尔滨市百货公司职工把分散在各商店的保安用品集中起来，在第十商店专门设立基本建设服务部，按照各基本建设、厂矿、林区、铁路、运输等单位的要求，采取加工订货的方式，双方签订合同，及时组织供应。同时第十商店还设有接待室和样品室，便利各单位购买和订货。
