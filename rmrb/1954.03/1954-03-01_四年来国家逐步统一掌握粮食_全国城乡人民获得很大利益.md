Since the founding of the Central People's Government, the state has attached great importance to grain work, which is crucial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It has gradually strengthened grain purchasing and supply work, changing the unreasonable situation before liberation where grain was manipulated by landlords, bureaucratic capitalists, and unscrupulous merchants, who cruelly exploited farmers through "high prices in spring and low prices in autumn." This has given China's grain work a new look, and the people in urban and rural areas have gained great benefits, proving that the state's unified control of grain brings boundless advantages.

Over the past four years, in order to meet the farmers' demands to sell surplus grain and ensure grain supply, the state has vigorously carried out grain purchasing work. Taking the amount of grain purchased by the state in 1950 as 100, it increased to 200 in 1951, 350.32 in 1952, and 424.4 in 1953. At the same time, the state has also reasonably and gradually increased the grain purchasing prices. According to statistics from the grain market directly controlled by the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, taking the average base price of various grains in 1950 as the base number and calculating the weighted average, it increased by 17.73 percent in 1951, 22.72 percent in 1952, and 31.88 percent in 1953. As a result of the implementation of the state's various grain purchasing measures, farmers have been able to sell their surplus grain. In particular, in remote areas and mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, before liberation, a large amount of surplus grain often could not be transported out, which affected the farmers' enthusiasm for production and the improvement of their lives. After liberation, the state vigorously carried out purchasing and strengthened transfer, which brought great benefits to the local farmers. For example, from 1950 to 1952, the state paid huge transportation costs to transfer more than 37.8 million catties of surplus grain from the Qingyang Special District of Gansu Province, and the purchasing price was higher than the local grain price. According to the calculation of transferring more than 12.6 million catties of surplus grain annually in the special district, the local farmers' income increased by 6 to 7 billion yuan each year. In other regions, the farmers have also been freed from the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants and increased their income due to the state's fair and reasonable purchasing prices. For example, farmers in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, generally needed two stones of rice to make a set of unlined clothes before liberation, but last autumn they only needed one stone of rice; before liberation, local farmers could only exchange one dou of rice for one catty of kerosene, but last autumn they could exchange it for five catties. In addition, the state grain departments in the northeastern provinces and many regions within the customs also pre-purchased grain from farmers to help them solve the difficulties in production and life during the "lean season" and avoid being exploited by unscrupulous merchants through "green crops loans." The farmers in the Tongchengzha area of Hanshan County, Anhui Province, immediately returned the "green crops" money of speculative merchants after receiving the deposit for pre-purchased grain from the state in the autumn of 1953, thus avoiding exploitation of more than 22,000 yuan per 100 catties of rice from the merchants.

In terms of grain supply, in recent years, due to the continuous development of cities, industrial and mining areas, economic crop areas, forest areas, and pastoral areas, plus the needs of disaster areas and rural grain-deficient households, about 200 million people across the country need grain supply every year. On the one hand, the supply coverage is very wide, and on the other hand, the amount of grain needed in many areas has increased quite rapidly, while the proportion of grain managed by the state grain departments has gradually increased. Taking the amount of grain sold by the state grain departments in 1950 as 100, it increased to 188.76 in 1951, 361.25 in 1952, and further increased in 1953. In cities and industrial and mining areas, according to statistics from fourteen large cities and industrial and mining areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, Anshan, and Benxi, the grain supplied by the state in 1953 increased by 183.84 percent compared with 1950. In economic crop areas, according to statistics from major cotton-producing areas, the total value of grain supplied by the state in 1952 reached 50.1 percent of the funds invested by the China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company for purchasing cotton. Under such circumstances, if the state's power is not used for overall planning and allocation, no other methods can guarantee sufficient grain supply and stable grain prices. As for the forest areas, pastoral areas, and minority areas, before liberation, the local people had always been exploited by speculative merchants who sold grain at high prices. After liberation, the state grain departments have continuously increased grain sales outlets in these areas, expanded the supply coverage, and supplied grain at reasonable prices, which has brought great benefits to the local people. Hunters in the Greater Khingan Mountains in Inner Mongolia reflected: "In the past, unscrupulous merchants used one bag of flour to exchange for fifteen grey squirrel skins from us; now the state supplies flour, and only four skins can be exchanged for one bag."

Over the past four years, due to the state's gradual unified control of grain, strengthening of grain purchasing and supply work, and the stipulation and control of reasonable grain prices, the face of China's grain work has undergone significant changes.

First of all, it has stabilized grain prices and reversed the phenomenon of sharp drops in grain prices when new grain comes on the market before liberation, leading to "bumper harvests turning into disasters" and "low grain prices hurting farmers," as well as the sharp rise in grain prices during the "lean season," causing great losses to consumers. Before liberation, most of the grain was controlled by landlords, compradors, and unscrupulous merchants as tools for speculation and exploitation, and combined with the reactionary rule's vicious inflation, they stirred up trouble in the market and became one of the main factors of price fluctuations. From the start of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937 to August 1948, when the puppet "Legal Tender" was declared bankrupt, prices in the Kuomintang reactionary government's controlled areas rose by six million times, and grain price fluctuations were a very important factor. Shortly after the founding of the Central People's Government, unscrupulous merchants in some areas also carried out large-scale grain speculation activities. For example, in early 1950, speculative merchants in Shanghai once launched a grain price surge of "three changes a day," which affected the prices of the entire market. After the state transferred a large amount of grain from the southwest and northeast, the speculative activities of the merchants were quickly cracked down. Since then, due to the state's further unified control of grain, grain prices across the country have been basically stable in recent years. Taking the national wholesale price index of grain in the main markets as 100 when national prices began to stabilize in March 1950, it was 76.61 in December of the same year, 88.29 in December 1951, 88.24 in December 1952, and 96.86 in October 1953. This has greatly guaranteed the stability of various prices across the country.

Before liberation, due to speculation and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants, grain prices also had excessive seasonal fluctuations, which was the unreasonable seasonal price difference of grain. From 1941 to 1942, the average seasonal price difference of grain in the Kuomintang reactionary government's controlled areas was around 50 percent. After liberation, due to the state's large-scale purchasing at reasonable prices when grain came on the market, the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants "depressing purchasing prices" were severely cracked down, and the era of sharp drops in grain prices, "bumper harvests turning into disasters," and "low grain prices hurting farmers" has become a thing of the past; at the same time, due to the state's large-scale control of grain, speculative merchants have basically been unable to manipulate prices, and the phenomenon of sharp rises in grain prices during the "lean season" has also basically stopped. According to statistics from the grain market directly controlled by the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, calculated by the weighted average of various grains, the seasonal price difference of grain was 21.76 percent in 1950, 18.99 percent in 1951, and 16.91 percent in 1952, and will be further reduced in 1953. Among them, the purchasing price of raw grain has increased year by year, while the selling price of finished grain has gradually decreased due to the active improvement of management by grain departments in various places, reducing commodity circulation costs, and reducing processing costs. This has protected the interests of grain producers and consumers, and has brought great benefits to the people in urban and rural areas.

Secondly, it has supported the people in areas affected by natural disasters to overcome the disasters and changed the phenomenon of large numbers of victims starving to death whenever natural disasters occurred before liberation. In the past four years, some areas of our country have also suffered from natural disasters of varying degrees. Due to the state's vigorous transfer of grain to support the disaster areas, the affected areas have basically achieved the slogan of "guaranteeing no one starves to death." For example, in the spring of 1953, after parts of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, and other provinces suffered from frost damage, the state transferred a large amount of grain from the southwest, northeast, and other places to the disaster areas. The grain transferred to the above-mentioned areas by various parts of the country in the second quarter accounted for about 46.13 percent of the total amount of grain transferred by the Central Grain Department in the whole season. In order to support the disaster areas, Gansu Province transferred surplus grain from thirty counties in six special districts. Some routes from the place of departure to the concentration point were as long as 500 kilometers, and all transportation forces such as trains, automobiles, carts, hand carts, donkeys, camels, and human carrying were used. After these grains were transported to the disaster areas, in addition to the part that was distributed for relief free of charge, they were supplied at the local established listed prices or even lower prices. For the corn transferred from the southwest region to Henan Province, the state had to subsidize about 15 yuan per catty. After receiving the grain, many victims in Henan and other places gratefully said: "Chairman Mao is even closer than our own mother. As soon as he heard that we were hit by a disaster here, he transported grain here from thousands of miles away. If it weren't for the government transporting grain, like before liberation, we really don't know how many people would have starved to death!"

Third, it has reversed the unfavorable situation of grain and population in our country for a long time, and has a certain amount of necessary exports based on unified allocation and increased grain production. Before liberation, due to the destruction of agricultural productivity and the inability of the reactionary government to carry out overall allocation of grain across the country, our country, a grain-producing country, has imported a large amount of grain over the years. Coastal cities imported large amounts of foreign rice and wheat every year, while Sichuan Province, known as the "Land of Abundance," often had a large amount of surplus grain that could not be transported out, resulting in a serious phenomenon of "low grain prices hurting farmers." After the founding of the Central People's Government, on the one hand, it vigorously developed agricultural production, and on the other hand, it vigorously coordinated and allocated grain across the country. In 1950, when the country carried out large-scale grain transfer work, 75,000 tons of surplus grain were transferred out of Sichuan Province, and a certain amount of external transfer was also carried out every year thereafter. In Fujian, Guizhou, Guangxi, Gansu, and other provinces with inconvenient transportation, there has always been a large amount of so-called "dead-end grain." The People's Government has planned to transfer them, and the amount of non-transferable commercial grain (so-called "dead-end grain," "difficult-to-transport grain") has decreased year by year. As a result, in recent years, our country has not only not needed to import grain, but also has had a certain amount of grain exports, which has increased funds for industrial construction.

    四年来国家逐步统一掌握粮食
    全国城乡人民获得很大利益
    中央人民政府成立以来，国家对关系国计民生重大的粮食工作十分重视，逐步加强粮食收购和供应工作，改变了在解放前粮食被地主、官僚资产阶级、以及奸商等操纵下“春贵秋贱”残酷剥削农民的不合理状况，使我国粮食工作面貌一新，城乡人民获得很大利益，证明了由国家统一掌握粮食，好处是无穷的。
    四年来，国家为了满足农民出售余粮的要求和保证粮食供应，大力开展了粮食收购工作。以一九五零年国家购粮数量为一百，一九五一年增加为二百，一九五二年为三百五十点三二，一九五三年为四百二十四点四。同时，国家还合理地逐步提高了粮食收购价格，据中央人民政府粮食部直接掌握的粮食市场的统计，以一九五零年各粮种平均收购基价为基数，加权平均计算，一九五一年提高了百分之十七点七三，一九五二年提高百分之二十二点七二，一九五三年提高百分之三十一点八八。国家各项购粮措施执行的结果，使农民的余粮都有了销路，特别是边远地区和山区等交通不便地区，解放前经常有大批余粮不能外运，影响了农民的生产情绪和生活的改善，解放后国家大力进行收购并加强调运，使当地农民得到很大利益。如一九五零年到一九五二年，国家付出巨大运费，从甘肃省庆阳专区调出农民余粮三千七百八十余万斤，收购价格又比当地粮价为高。该专区按每年调出余粮一千二百六十余万斤计算，每年当地农民即增加收入六、七十亿元。就是在其它地区，由于国家收购价钱公平合理，也使农民摆脱了奸商的剥削，增加了收入。如江苏省松江县农民在解放前做一套单衣，一般要用两石大米，去年秋季只要用一石大米；解放前当地农民用一斗大米只能换一斤火油，去年秋季能换到五斤。另外，东北各省和关内许多地区的国家粮食部门还向农民预购粮食，帮助农民解决了“青黄不接”时生产和生活上的困难，并避免遭受奸商“放青苗”等的剥削。安徽省含山县铜城闸一带的农民，一九五三年秋在得到国家预购粮食的订金后，立即退还了投机奸商的“青苗”钱，每百斤稻谷即免受奸商二万二千余元的剥削。
    在粮食供应方面，几年来由于城市、工矿区、经济作物区、林区、牧区的不断发展，加上灾区和农村缺粮户的需要，全国每年约有两亿多人口需要粮食供应。一方面是供应的面很广，另一方面，很多地区，需要粮食数量增加又相当快，同时国家粮食部门经营粮食的比例又逐渐增加。以一九五零年国家粮食部门销售粮食数量为一百，一九五一年增加为一百八十八点七六，一九五二年增加为三百六十一点二五，一九五三年又有增加。在城市、工矿区，据北京、天津、鞍山、本溪等十四个大城市和工矿区的统计，国家在一九五三年供应的粮食，比一九五零年增加了百分之一百八十三点八四。在经济作物区，据各主要产棉区的统计，一九五二年国家供应粮食的总值，达中国花纱布公司所投放购棉资金的百分之五十点一。在这样的情况下，如果不用国家的力量进行统筹调度，其它任何办法都不能保证粮食的充分供应和粮价稳定。至于在林区、牧区和少数民族地区，解放前，当地人民历来受投机奸商等高价出售粮食的剥削。解放后，国家粮食部门在这些地区不断增加售粮点，扩大供应面，用合理的价格供应粮食，使当地人民获得很多利益。内蒙古大兴安岭森林中的猎户反映：“过去不法奸商用一袋面粉换我们十五张灰鼠皮；现在国家供应面粉，只要四张皮就能换一袋面。”
    四年来，由于国家逐步统一掌握粮食，加强粮食收购和供应工作，并规定和掌握了合理的粮食价格，我国粮食工作的面貌已发生了显著的变化。
    首先是，稳定了粮价，并扭转了解放前新粮上市时粮价猛跌，以致“丰收成灾”、“谷贱伤农”，和“青黄不接”时粮价猛涨，消费者受到很大损失的现象。解放前，粮食大部分被地主、买办阶级和奸商掌握起来作为投机、剥削的工具，和反动统治的恶性通货膨胀结合，就在市场上兴风作浪，成为物价波动的主要因素之一。从一九三七年抗日战争开始到一九四八年八月伪“法币”宣告破产的十一年间，国民党反动政府统治区的物价上涨了六百万倍，粮价波动是个很重要的因素。中央人民政府刚成立不久，部分地区的不法奸商还曾进行过较大规模的粮食投机活动。如一九五零年初，上海市投机奸商曾一度掀起了“一日三变”的粮价涨风，牵动了整个市场的物价，经过国家从西南、东北调运到大批粮食，奸商投机活动被迅速打击下去。以后，由于国家进一步统一掌握了粮食，几年来全国粮价基本上是稳定的。以一九五零年三月全国物价开始稳定时，全国主要市场粮食批发价格类指数为一百，同年十二月为七十六点六一，一九五一年十二月为八十八点二九，一九五二年十二月为八十八点二四，一九五三年十月为九十六点八六。这样就在很大的程度上保证了全国各种物价的稳定。
    在解放前，由于奸商投机操纵，粮价还有过大的季节性的波动，这就是不合理的粮食季节差价。一九四一年到一九四二年，国民党反动政府统治区的粮食季节差价平均为百分之五十上下。解放后，由于国家在粮食上市时用合理的价格大量收购，奸商“压价收购”的投机活动受到了严重的打击，粮价猛跌，“丰收成灾”、“谷贱伤农”的时代已成为过去；同时由于国家大量掌握了粮食，投机奸商基本上已不能操纵物价，“青黄不接”时粮价猛涨的现象基本上也已停止。据中央人民政府粮食部直接掌握的粮食市场的统计，以各粮种加权平均计算，
  一九五零年粮食季节差价为百分之二十一点七六，一九五一年为百分之十八点九九，一九五二年为百分之十六点九一，一九五三年将更为缩小。其中收购原粮的价格逐年提高，而成品粮的出售价格，由于各地粮食部门积极改善经营管理，逐年降低商品流转费用，减低加工成本，因而逐渐下降，这样便保护了粮食生产者和消费者的利益，使城乡人民得到很大的好处。
    其次，支援遭受自然灾害地区的人民战胜灾荒，改变了解放前一遇到自然灾害，就要饿死大批灾民的现象。四年来，我国部分地区还遭受了不同程度的自然灾害，由于国家大力调运粮食支援灾区，受灾地区都基本上实现了“保证不饿死人”的口号。如一九五三年春季，河南、安徽、江苏、山东等省部分地区遭受霜灾后，国家从西南、东北等地向灾区大量调运粮食。全国各地第二季度调往上述地区的粮食，约占中央粮食部全季调粮数量的百分之四十六点一三。甘肃省为了支援灾区，调运了六个专区三十个县的余粮，由起运地到集中地，有的路线长达五百公里，使用了火车、汽车、大车、手推车、毛驴、骆驼以及人力背挑等一切运输力量。这些粮食运到灾区以后，除了无代价地发放救济的部分外，都按当地既定的牌价或更低的价格进行供应。由西南区调到河南省的玉米，每斤国家要贴钱十五元左右。河南等地许多灾民得到粮食以后，感激地说：“毛主席比亲娘还亲，一听说咱这里遭了灾，就从几千里路以外往这里运粮。要不是政府运来粮食，像解放前那样，真不知道要饿死多少人呢！”
    第三、扭转了我国长期以来粮食人口的不利形势，并在统一调度和粮食增产的基础上有了一定数量的必要输出。解放前，由于农业生产力的破坏，和反动政府不能对全国粮食进行统筹调度，我国这样一个出产粮食的国家，历年来都有大量粮食进口。每年沿海城市大量进口洋米、洋麦，号称“天府之国”的四川省却经常有大批余粮不能外运，有严重的“谷贱伤农”的现象。中央人民政府成立以后，一面大力发展农业生产，一面大力统筹和调度全国的粮食，一九五零年全国进行大规模的调粮工作时，从四川省调出余粮七万五千吨，以后每年也有一定数量的外调。福建、贵州、广西、甘肃等省交通不便地区，历来有大批所谓“死角粮”，人民政府都有计划地加以调运，不能调度的商品粮（所谓“死角粮”、“难运粮”）已逐年减少。结果，几年来我国不但不需要进口粮食，还有了一定数量的粮食输出，为工业建设增加了资金。
