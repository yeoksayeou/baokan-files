Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 10th: The Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) opened in Geneva on the 9th. Representatives from twenty-four European countries and the United States participated, along with representatives from several specialized non-governmental organizations. The head of the Soviet delegation was P.N. Kumykin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the USSR. The head of the French delegation was Edgar Faure, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs of France. The head of the British delegation was Lord Reading, Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom. The head of the Danish delegation was Krag, Danish Minister of Labor and Social Affairs. The head of the Norwegian delegation was Brofoss, Norwegian Minister of Commerce.

The meeting was opened by the Chairman of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the Czechoslovak representative, Uher, who pointed out that this session was being held at a time when international tensions were easing, which should have a favorable impact on the work of the meeting. The Economic Commission has contributed to expanding cooperation between countries. The East-West European Trade Conference held in Geneva in April 1953 yielded positive results, and many economic agreements were concluded between Eastern and Western European countries after the conference. He pointed out that this meeting would discuss the issue of expanding economic relations between European countries.

The Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Myrdal, then spoke. He noted with satisfaction that economic relations between Eastern and Western European countries were expanding, and he pointed out that the representatives of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries had made great contributions to the work of the Commission. He expressed his hope that the Ninth Session would be an important factor in promoting economic relations between European countries, and pointed out that there was great interest in the work of this session, as evidenced by the composition of the delegations attending.

The meeting will continue until the end of March.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 12th: The Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe held a meeting on the 10th. The Czechoslovak representative, Uher, was elected as Chairman of the meeting, and the Greek representative, Zolotas, as Vice-Chairman. After the agenda was adopted, representatives from France, the Soviet Union, and Finland delivered general speeches.

The French representative, Edgar Faure, pointed out the important role played by the Economic Commission in promoting international cooperation. He emphasized that the Commission was right to focus its attention on important issues such as developing economic cooperation between Eastern and Western European countries. He said: The consolidation of peace is closely related to the normalization of international economic relations on the basis of considering each other's interests. He emphasized that some economic agreements concluded between France and Eastern Europe were in line with France's own interests.

The Soviet representative, P.N. Kumykin, then spoke. He said that this session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe was being held in an atmosphere of easing international tensions and increasing importance of developing economic ties between all European countries. This situation determines the great importance of this session and the responsibilities of all participating countries for the smooth discussion and resolution of various agenda items. Kumykin said that the Soviet delegation's view was based on the premise that mutually beneficial trade between all countries, regardless of their economic and social systems, is one of the necessary conditions for developing a peaceful economy, raising the living standards of the people of all countries, and promoting mutual understanding and friendship between the people of all countries.

Kumykin said that the Soviet Union would participate in the work of the nine committees of the Economic Commission for Europe in the future and would establish a permanent representative at the Economic Commission. The Soviet representative agreed with the proposal made by the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, Myrdal, on establishing inter-regional trade cooperation.

He then said that the Soviet delegation believed that while strengthening and expanding trade relations between all European countries, there was also an urgent need to strengthen and develop trade relations between European countries and countries in Asia, the Far East, and Latin America.

The Finnish representative, Vehmas, pointed out the difficulties that the Finnish economy had suffered after the war and was therefore interested in developing trade with Eastern European countries. He emphasized that the trade agreement signed between Finland and the Soviet Union helped Finland overcome some unsolvable economic difficulties, especially making it possible to reduce unemployment.

The meeting also discussed the proposal made by the Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, to invite representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the work of the meeting. This issue will be further discussed at the meeting on the 11th.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 12th: The French Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Faure, who attended the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, stated on March 8th before leaving for Geneva that France must conduct more trade with Eastern Europe, and that the "embargo" policy is an obstacle to expanding this trade.

He said: "Trade between France and the East must be further developed." Faure pointed out that trade between France and Eastern European countries had shown "significant improvement" in the past few months. He said that according to the Franco-Soviet trade agreement, the amount of trade between France and the Soviet Union will exceed the current amount in the future. However, Faure believes that there are still obstacles in this regard, one of which is the "ban on the export of strategic materials."

    联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议开会
    苏联代表主张扩大各国贸易关系
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议于九日在日内瓦开幕。参加会议的有二十四个欧洲国家和美国的代表，以及一些专门性的非政府组织的代表。苏联代表团团长是苏联对外贸易部副部长帕·尼·库米金。法国代表团团长是法国财政经济部部长埃加·富尔。英国代表团团长是英国外交副大臣里丁。丹麦代表团团长是丹麦劳工社会大臣克拉格。挪威代表团团长是挪威商务大臣布罗弗斯。
    会议由联合国欧洲经济委员会主席捷克斯洛伐克代表乌里赫主持开幕。他指出本届会议正当国际紧张局势趋于缓和的时候举行，这对于会议的工作应该有有利的影响。经济委员会对于扩大各国之间的合作是有贡献的。一九五三年四月在日内瓦举行的东西欧贸易会议得到了积极的结果，东欧与西欧国家之间在会后缔结了许多经济协定。他指出，这次会议要讨论扩大欧洲各国之间的经济关系问题。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔继起发言。他满意地指出东欧与西欧国家之间的经济关系正在扩大，他指出苏联与东欧国家的代表对于委员会的工作作了很大的贡献。他表示他希望第九届会议将是促进欧洲国家之间的经济关系的重要因素，并指出大家对于这次会议的工作有很大的兴趣，出席本届会议的代表团的组成说明了这一点。
    这次会议将继续开到三月底。
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议于十日举行会议。选出捷克斯洛伐克代表乌里赫为会议主席，希腊代表佐罗塔斯为副主席。在通过议程以后，法国、苏联和芬兰代表先后作了一般性的发言。
    法国代表埃加·富尔指出经济委员会在促进国际合作方面所起的重要作用。他强调说，委员会把注意力集中在发展东欧与西欧国家间经济合作这一类重要问题上是对的。他说：和平的巩固与在考虑彼此利益的基础上使得国际经济关系正常化有着密切的关系。他着重指出，法国与东欧缔结的一些经济协定是符合于法国自身的利益的。
    接着发言的是苏联代表帕·尼·库米金。他说，联合国欧洲经济委员会本届会议是在国际紧张局势趋于缓和、发展所有欧洲国家之间的经济联系的重要性日益增加的气氛中举行的。这种情况便决定了本届会议的巨大重要性和各与会国家对于顺利讨论和解决各项议程所负的责任。库米金说，苏联代表团的这种看法是从这样一个前提出发的：所有国家不管其经济与社会制度如何，进行互利贸易是发展和平经济、提高各国人民的生活水平与促进各国人民的相互谅解与友谊的必要条件之一。
    库米金说，苏联将来将参加欧洲经济委员会的九个委员会的工作，并将在经济委员会派设常驻代表。苏联代表同意欧洲经济委员会执行秘书密达尔提出的关于建立区域间贸易合作的建议。
    他接着说，苏联代表团认为在加强和扩大所有欧洲国家之间的贸易关系的同时，也急需加强并发展欧洲国家与亚洲、远东和拉丁美洲国家的贸易关系。
    芬兰代表韦赫摩指出芬兰经济在战后所遭受到的困难，因此对发展对东欧国家的贸易感到兴趣。他着重指出，芬兰和苏联签订的贸易协定帮助芬兰克服了一些无法解决的经济困难，特别是使它有可能减少了失业人数。
    会上并讨论了波兰代表卡茨—苏希提出的邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加会议工作的建议。这个问题将在十一日会上作进一步讨论。
    【新华社十二日讯】巴黎消息：出席联合国欧洲经济委员会的法国财政经济部部长富尔，三月八日在动身赴日内瓦前表示，法国必须与东欧进行更多的贸易，而“禁运”政策是扩展这种贸易的障碍。
    他说：“法国和东方之间的贸易必须有更多的发展。”富尔指出，法国与东欧国家之间的贸易在过去数月中已有了“明显的改进”。他说，根据法苏贸易协定，今后法国与苏联的贸易数额将会超过目前的数量。但是富尔认为在这方面还有着障碍，其中之一就是“对战略物资出口的禁令”。
