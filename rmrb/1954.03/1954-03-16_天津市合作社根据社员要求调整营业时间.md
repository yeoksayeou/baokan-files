Tianjin Municipality Cooperatives Adjust Business Hours According to Members' Requests

In the past half-month, cooperatives in various districts of Tianjin have adjusted their business hours based on the demands of their members. According to preliminary statistics from the Tianjin Cooperative General Society, 140 grassroots cooperative units across the city have implemented continuous shifts. Among the grassroots cooperatives that are not yet able to implement continuous shifts due to immature conditions, 133 units have also appropriately extended their midday or afternoon business hours.

Prior to adjusting business hours, many grassroots cooperatives conducted relatively detailed investigations and research, soliciting members' opinions on the cooperatives' business hours and studying the business personnel's work and sales patterns. During the implementation of continuous shifts, many cooperatives established a team-based operational responsibility system to ensure that work is not disrupted during rotation and staggered shifts.

Members and the public have welcomed the implementation of continuous shifts or the extension of business hours. When Zhou Da Niang, a member representative of the Xiaoguozhuang Cooperative in the Fourth District, announced the adjustment of business hours to the members, they were very happy. An old man in his fifties said: "Before, when we went to the cooperative to buy things, we couldn't buy them because it was past noon. Now that the hours have been adjusted, it's so convenient!" Zhao Yuzhen and other member representatives from the Fourth Cotton Mill Cooperative in the Sixth District also voluntarily helped maintain order in the cooperative when it was busy. They said to the cooperative负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge): "Your extended business hours make it so convenient for members to buy things; if you are ever busy in the future, you can ask us to help."

After the cooperatives adjusted their business hours, sales also increased compared to before. The Nanhua Li Cooperative branch in the Sixth District implemented continuous shifts on February 23, and the sales on that day increased by 5 million yuan compared to February 22. The non-staple food stall at the Xingye Li branch of the Seventh District Cooperative saw its sales increase by 9% compared to before the adjustment.

The shortcomings in Tianjin's cooperatives' adjustment of business hours are: some cooperatives extended business hours without implementing continuous shifts or reasonably adjusting labor organization, but instead adopted overtime. For example, after some branches of the First District Cooperative extended their business hours, they effectively cancelled the provision that salespersons take one day off per week on a rotating basis. In addition, after many units implemented continuous shifts, some necessary internal procedures and systems were not updated in a timely manner. These shortcomings should be studied and improved.

### 天津市合作社根据社员要求调整营业时间

    天津市合作社根据社员要求调整营业时间
    天津市各区合作社根据社员群众的要求，在最近半个多月来先后调整了营业时间。据天津市合作总社的初步统计，全市基层合作社已有一百四十个单位实行了连带上班制；因条件不成熟还不能实行连带上班制的基层合作社，也有一百三十三个单位适当地延长了中午或下午的营业时间。
    在调整营业时间以前，许多基层合作社都作了比较细致的调查研究工作，征求社员对合作社营业时间的意见，研究业务员的工作和销货规律。在实行连带上班制的过程中，许多合作社建立了小组营业负责制，保证在轮流休息和实行插班作业时工作不乱。
    社员群众对实行连带上班制或延长营业时间，非常欢迎。第四区小郭庄合作社社员代表周大娘向社员群众宣布合作社调整营业时间的时候，社员们都非常高兴，有个五十多岁的老大爷说：以前我们到合作社去买东西，因为中午过点了，就买不到；现在调整了时间，可太方便啦！第六区第四棉纺厂合作社的社员代表赵玉珍等在合作社忙的时候，还主动到合作社帮助维持秩序。她们对合作社的负责人说：你们延长营业时间，对社员们买东西太方便了；以后你们要是业务忙，可以找我们来帮忙。
    合作社调整营业时间后，营业额也较前增加了。第六区南华里合作社分销处在二月二十三日实行连带上班制，这一天营业额就比二十二日增加了五百万元；第七区合作社兴业里分销处副食摊，营业额比调整时间以前增加了百分之九。
    天津市合作社调整营业时间工作中的缺点是：部分合作社没有在实行连带上班制或合理调整劳动组织的基础上延长营业时间，而是采取加班加点的办法。如第一区合作社部分分销处延长了营业时间以后，竟将售货员每周轮流休息一天的规定无形中取消了。另外，不少单位实行连带上班制以后，内部的一些必要的手续、制度没有及时地跟上去。这些缺点应注意研究改进。
