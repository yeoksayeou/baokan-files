Why Did One of the Two Agricultural Cooperatives Trialed in a County Succeed While the Other Failed?
    Meng Zhongxiang, Yu Keyi

    The Ye Dejin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Berlin Township, Zhangmuqiao District, and the Fu Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songwei Township, Taoxi District, in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, were both established on a trial basis in 1953. One cooperative had stronger leadership and its members were genuinely willing, with a better foundation of mutual aid, and as a result, it was successful. The other lacked good leadership, the masses were not genuinely willing, and the foundation of mutual aid was poor. It was forcibly established by cadres sent from the county and district/township, and as a result, it collapsed.

    The Ye Dejin Agricultural Production Cooperative was originally a large mutual aid team formed by merging three smaller teams. The team members lived close to each other, the land was connected, and the team leader, Ye Dejin, and the active members of the team had great prestige among the masses. In October 1952, the county party committee decided that this team should be the first to trial an agricultural production cooperative. They first educated the team members on the path of rural economic development, and repeatedly explained the benefits and specific methods of agricultural production cooperation, as well as interpreting policies. After full consultation, the agricultural production cooperative was established in January 1953 on the basis of complete voluntary participation by the masses. Later, in the evaluation of land and the pricing of cattle and farm tools, voluntary participation and mutual non-exploitation were also achieved.

    After the establishment of the cooperative, party committees at all levels attached great importance to leading it. A full-time cooperative cadre and a township cadre worked in the cooperative regularly. The deputy secretary of the district party committee directly supervised it, and the county and prefectural party committees also frequently sent people to help. The cooperative originally had four members of the Communist Youth League, two labor models, and six activists; during the process of establishing the cooperative, in addition to paying attention to educating and improving these key members, the leadership also cultivated four new activists. These key members formed the leadership core within the cooperative, driving the masses to improve production. The leading cadres also attached great importance to the ideological education of the cooperative members, and promptly resolved problems when they were discovered. For example, before the autumn harvest, the cooperative members did not know how much they would be able to distribute, and were calculating day and night, fearing that they would lose out. As a result, their enthusiasm for the autumn harvest was low. The cooperative affairs committee immediately studied a preliminary distribution plan, and made trial calculations household by household, which dispelled the cooperative members' concerns and stabilized their production mood.

    The Ye Dejin Agricultural Production Cooperative also did a relatively good job in its management. The various production groups had a clear division of labor and fixed responsibilities, and important matters were discussed by the cooperative members' congress. In addition to having a year-round production plan, there were specific plans for each agricultural season. The cooperative had a flour mill, and sideline production was also carried out in a planned manner. Models were selected in both the summer and autumn seasons, encouraging the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

    Due to the great strength of collective production, the cooperative selected good varieties, practiced deep plowing and close planting, increased the application of fertilizer, and organized more than 1,200 people to manually draw water to fight drought. The entire cooperative's 258 mu of paddy fields yielded a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 519 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 20% compared to 1952. The income of all 22 households in the cooperative increased. Everyone had confidence in running the cooperative even better.

    The Fu Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative was also originally a large mutual aid team, but its foundation was not good. In April 1952, Fu Xianting and others saw that the mutual aid teams in neighboring villages were working together in a lively manner, so they invited seven households to form a temporary exchange labor team. The formation was basically voluntary. Wang Jiawen, a township cadre who was fond of bragging, exaggerated the achievements and boasted to the district about how good the Fu Xianting mutual aid team was. In June, when the district party secretary came to inspect the team, Wang Jiawen ran ahead to the team to greet them and told everyone to "collectively" gather their farm tools together. The district party secretary saw this and blindly praised them, and instructed: "Your team should expand, the more it expands the better, and you should also engage in sideline production." Later, Sun Deming, the deputy secretary of the district party committee (now transferred), also said: "Our district is preparing to trial an agricultural production cooperative after the autumn harvest. We'll see which one does better, your team or the Wei Shangting mutual aid team in Beiyu Township, and then we'll start with that one." Wang Jiawen often stimulated them:
  "Work hard, or Beiyu Township will really start first!" At this time, the atmosphere of "competing for honor" was already very strong within the team. After a while, the district sent cadres to expand the team and help formulate a sideline production plan, intending to merge several nearby temporary seasonal mutual aid teams into the Fu Xianting team to engage in sideline production and create a "decent banner of agricultural and sideline combination" in preparation for establishing a cooperative after the autumn harvest. The members of the Fu Xianting mutual aid team were also actively mobilizing people outside the team to join in order to "compete for honor." As a result, 29 households were drawn from six nearby temporary seasonal mutual aid teams and merged into a large team of 36 households. Township cadre Wang Jiawen had boasted to the district party secretary: "Our ancestors for several generations have known how to make vermicelli, and we have all the furniture (actually not all of it), but we don't have the capital. As long as the government provides a loan, we can get started." Therefore, when formulating the sideline production plan, they planned to open a vermicelli workshop and requested a government loan of 20 million yuan.

    The large team of 36 households did not work well together, and 16 households withdrew during the autumn harvest assessment. The remaining 20 households borrowed 7 million yuan from the government and bought equipment for making vermicelli, such as grinding stones, large pots, and large vats, and also bought 18 pigs. The vermicelli workshop started production in late August, but because soybeans were expensive and the technology was low, the vermicelli produced could not be sold, and it lost more than 1.4 million yuan within two months. The 18 pigs also got sick due to poor management. At this time, the team members had many opinions and were unwilling to continue, but township cadre Wang Jiawen made a false report to the district, saying that the sideline production had earned more than 1 million yuan. Team leader Fu Xianting saw that the team members had many opinions and was afraid that he would not be able to bear the responsibility if things went wrong. He ran to the district to report to the deputy secretary of the district party committee about the losses in the sideline production, the team members' unwillingness to continue, and the pigs' illness. The deputy secretary waved his hand and said:
  "It doesn't matter, I know. I heard that your vermicelli workshop has already earned more than 1 million yuan and the pigs are growing very well, there's nothing wrong. Go back and do it boldly. Even if you lose money, as long as you don't pocket it, I won't ask you to pay for it." Fu Xianting returned and told the team members: "We have to keep doing it even if we lose money, the district won't let us stop." So they continued to struggle on. In order to reduce the expenses of the vermicelli workshop, the team members were told to eat at home and work for the vermicelli workshop. Everyone was unwilling, so they were assigned work by force. As a result, the team members had even more opinions. It was not until two pigs died later that the vermicelli workshop stopped.

    The 20 team members lived very scattered and lacked leadership. The team leader himself did not have prestige among the masses. At that time, the Taoxi District Party Committee emphasized "the combination of agriculture and sideline industries." Seeing that the Fu Xianting team had sideline industries, they designated it as the target for a trial cooperative. In early November 1952, the county party committee sent cadres to investigate whether the team met the conditions for establishing a cooperative. At a meeting of team members, Fu Xianting introduced the situation of the team and said: "Our team has a poor foundation. The land and villages are scattered, and the team members have difficulties in their lives. I'm afraid it won't work. It will be embarrassing if it fails. Let others do it first, and we'll do it after others have done well." The cadre who came to investigate thought he was backward and threw his notebook down in anger and said: "You, the team leader, are backward and don't want to do it! I know the situation in your team. According to the district, your team has seventeen or eighteen fat pigs, and they are growing very fat; the vermicelli workshop has earned more than 1 million yuan, and the team members are very enthusiastic about establishing a cooperative. Why do you say you are afraid it won't work? You don't want to do it? The team members have difficulties in their lives, and the government will give each team member 10 dan of rice." After he lost his temper, many people who were unwilling to do it did not dare to speak up; some were willing to do it when they heard "10 dan of rice." So when he asked everyone at the meeting whether they agreed to establish a cooperative, everyone said "agree." He did not understand the real situation in the team, so he went back to report. The county party committee listened to his report and approved the establishment of the cooperative. Team leader Fu Xianting originally did not want to establish a cooperative, but seeing that others wanted to do it, and fearing that others would say he was backward, and wanting to gain the trust of the superiors and become the cooperative director, he pretended to be active again; team member Hong Kejun was also very active in order to "compete for honor"; team member Zhao Benzhou heard the cadre for starting the cooperative say to him, "You are the only one in this team with some culture. If the cooperative is established, you will be the accountant. If it develops to 50 households, you can become a cadre detached from production." He originally did not want to establish a cooperative, but in order to become a cadre and get a government loan, he became active. The cadre for starting the cooperative seized these three "active members" with different ideological motivations to mobilize the masses to join the cooperative. The team members were originally scared by the investigating cadre, those who had difficulties in life also wanted to get "10 dan of rice," and some were following the crowd in order to "compete for honor." Therefore, in the first stage of establishing the cooperative, it seemed like "voluntary participation" on the surface.

    When discussing the distribution ratio of land and labor, only one household proposed to distribute profits according to land 40% and labor 60%, while the rest agreed to divide the profits equally. The leadership did not adopt the opinions of the majority of cooperative members, and finally decided to divide the profits according to 40% land and 60% labor. Some team members calculated that they would lose out and were unwilling, so the cadre starting the cooperative went to mobilize them separately, and the three active members also came to help. They were afraid of being isolated and attacked if they did not join the cooperative in the future, so they reluctantly agreed. When water carts were valued for contribution to the cooperative, it was stipulated that the price would be repaid in three years; team member Wang Zhengkui was unwilling, so the cadre starting the cooperative asked him "Why don't you want to do it? What are you thinking?" He was frightened and dared not speak again. When the election of cooperative cadres was being planned, Fu Xianting wooed some team members to elect him as the cooperative director, and said that he would not join the cooperative if he was not elected as the cooperative director, and the cadre starting the cooperative also accommodated him. Everything was ready, and a meeting of cooperative members to join the cooperative was to be held on December 20; however, five households proposed to withdraw because they did not want Fu Xianting to be the cooperative director and were afraid of losing out. As a result, the meeting to join the cooperative was not held. In order to "complete the task," the cadre starting the cooperative held meetings, both large and small, to carry out mobilization. Several "active members" were afraid of losing face if the cooperative could not be established, so they also helped to mobilize. Team members Fu Xianming and Shi Fengyun calculated that they would lose four or five dan of rice and were unwilling to join the cooperative; the district party secretary and the director of the county agricultural association both lived in their homes and persuaded them to join the cooperative every day. The cadre starting the cooperative said to them in a simple and blunt manner: "If you don't join the cooperative, do you still want to engage in individual farming and get rich, and take the capitalist road?" After repeated forced mobilization, they were afraid that they would not be able to do it if they did not join the cooperative, so they reluctantly joined the cooperative. There were also three households who were unwilling to join the cooperative, and they were taken to the district for education, but they were still unwilling. In the end, the 17 households who expressed "willingness to join the cooperative" were organized into an agricultural production cooperative.

    Although the cooperative also elected a director and deputy director and established various organizational structures, the director Fu Xianting wanted to take advantage of his position as director, could not take the lead in production, and his work style was undemocratic. The entire production of the cooperative was unplanned, and labor was not properly allocated. Every day, work was thought up and assigned temporarily. Meetings were held every night to rate work performance, competing to call out low scores, arguing until midnight, unable to get up in the morning, and unable to work hard. Farmers outside the cooperative could plant 1.8 mu of fields a day by getting up early and going to bed late, while they only planted 0.9 mu per person per day. Weeding in the cooperative was also not as good as individual farmers and mutual aid teams. As a result, the output was greatly reduced. They did not calculate costs in production, and spent a lot more money. The cooperative members also did not cherish the livestock and farm tools in the cooperative. The cooperative's method of evaluating work and recording points was unreasonable, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor was greatly affected. Many people "loafed on the job," and those who worked actively were also ridiculed.

    By the autumn harvest, the yield was very low, with an average yield of 370 jin and 5 liang of rice per mu, 54 jin and 11 liang less than that of nearby individual farmers, and 129 jin and 11 liang less than that of mutual aid teams. The total output was 2,705 jin less than before the establishment of the cooperative. At the same time, the expenses were also very large. After deducting the cost of hiring short-term workers, buying fertilizer, buying cattle fodder, and the depreciation and losses of farm tools, the actual income was even less. As a result of the profit distribution, the income of nine households decreased, with the most losing more than 1,900 jin of rice compared to before joining the cooperative; the income of four households was the same as before joining the cooperative, and only the income of four households with less land and more labor was slightly higher. In this way, most of the cooperative members were unwilling to continue.

    After the establishment of the Fu Xianting Agricultural Production Cooperative, the county party committee and the district party committee also often sent cadres to visit, but they did not stay long. A total of 13 cadres were sent and transferred, and they were transferred away as soon as they had grasped a little of the situation. Therefore, the problems in the cooperative have not been resolved. In September 1953, the masses studied the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and were willing to change to mutual aid teams. Everyone believed that: the path of organizing ourselves pointed out by Chairman Mao is good, but it is only because we had a poor foundation of mutual aid, had no experience, and had no good leadership that we made such a mess. Everyone expressed that they would work hard after the reorganization, and establish a cooperative again when the conditions are met.

    The Shucheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the situation of these two trial cooperatives, found the reasons for their success and failure, so as to learn from these experiences and lessons in future cooperative establishment.

    一个县试办的两个农业合作社为什么一个办好了一个垮台了
    孟钟祥　余克一
    安徽省舒城县张母桥区柏林乡叶德金农业生产合作社和桃溪区宋圩乡傅先廷农业生产合作社，都是一九五三年试办的。一个社领导骨干较强，社员真正自愿，互助基础较好，结果办好了。一个社缺乏好的骨干，群众不是真正自愿，互助基础也不好，是一些县里派的干部和区乡干部勉强要农民办起来的，结果垮台了。
    叶德金农业生产合作社原来是由三个互助组并成的一个大组，组员住得靠近，土地连成一片，组长叶德金和组内的积极分子在群众中很有威信。一九五二年十月，县委确定由这个组试办农业生产合作社。他们先对社员进行了农村经济发展道路的教育，并且反复说明了农业生产合作的好处和具体办法，讲解了政策。经过充分的酝酿，一九五三年一月在群众完全自愿的基础上建立了农业生产合作社。以后在土地评产、耕牛农具折价时，也都做到了自愿和互不吃亏。
    建社以后，各级党委都很重视对这个社的领导。有一个专职办社干部和一个乡干部经常在社里工作，区委副书记直接掌握，县委地委也常派人来帮助。社里原有四个青年团员、两个劳动模范和六个积极分子；在办社过程中，领导方面除了注意教育提高这些骨干以外，还新培养了四个积极分子。这些骨干分子在社内形成了领导核心，带动群众搞好生产。领导干部也很重视对社员的思想教育，发现问题及时解决。如秋收前，社员们不知道能分多少红，日夜盘算怕吃亏，秋收的劲头不大。社务委员会立即研究了初步分红计划，逐户试算，就打破了社员的顾虑，稳定了生产情绪。
    叶德金农业生产合作社的经营管理工作也做得比较好，各生产小组分工明确，责任固定，重要的事都经过社员大会讨论。除了有全年的生产计划外，每个农事季节都有具体的计划。社里有一个粉坊，副业生产也是有计划地进行。在夏、秋两季都评选了模范，鼓励了社员的生产积极性。
    由于集体生产力量大，社里选用了良种，做到了深耕密植，增施了肥料，并组织一千二百多个人工车水抗旱，全社二百五十八亩多稻田得到了丰收，每亩平均收了五百一十九斤稻，比一九五二年增加二成。全社二十二户都增加了收入。大家都有信心把社办得更好。
    傅先廷农业生产合作社原来也是一个大互助组，但是基础并不好。一九五二年四月间，傅先廷等人看见邻乡的互助组在一起劳动很热闹，就邀了七户组成一个临时换工组，基本上还是自愿结合的。乡干部王加文好大喜功，就夸大成绩，向区里吹嘘傅先廷互助组好。六月间，区委书记来检查这个组，王加文就抄前跑到组里打招呼，叫大家把农具“集体”起来，拿到一起。区委书记看了，盲目地表扬了一番，并指示说：“你们组要扩大，越扩大越好，还要搞副业。”以后区委副书记孙德明（现已调动）又来说：“我们区秋后准备试办一个农业生产合作社，看你们这个组与北隅乡韦上亭互助组那个搞得好就先办那个。”王加文就经常刺激他们：
  “要好好干，不然真搞到北隅乡先办啦！”这时，
  “争光荣”的空气在组内已经很浓厚了。过些时，区里派来了干部，一面扩大组，一面帮助订副业生产计划，打算把附近几个临时季节性互助组合并到傅先廷组里来，搞起副业，办出一个“像样的农副业结合的旗帜”，准备秋后办社。傅先廷互助组的组员为了“争光荣”，也都积极动员组外群众入组；结果从附近六个临时季节互助组里抽出二十九户，并成一个三十六户的大组。乡干部王加文曾在区委书记面前吹嘘过：“我们祖上几代都会做粉丝，家具都有（实际上不全），就是没有本钱，只要政府贷款就能干起来。”于是，订副业生产计划时就准备开粉坊，要求政府贷款二千万元。
    三十六户的大组在一起搞不好，秋收评比时就有十六户退出了。剩下的二十户，向政府贷款七百万元，买了磨子、大锅、大缸等做粉丝的用具，又买了十八条猪。八月下旬粉坊开始生产了，由于豆子贵、技术低，做出的粉丝卖不掉，两个月内亏本一百四十多万元。十八条猪也因为管理不好生了病。这时组员意见很多，不愿干了，可是乡干部王加文却向区里作假报告，说副业赚了一百多万元。组长傅先廷看见组员意见很多，怕搞坏了自己负不了责任，跑到区里把副业亏本、组员不愿干、猪生病等情况向区委副书记汇报。副书记摇摇手说：
  “不要紧，我知道，听说你们粉坊已赚一百多万元、猪长得很好，没有事。你回去大胆干，即使亏本，只要你不搞下腰包去，不要你赔。”傅先廷回来对组员说：“亏本也要干，区里不准歇。”于是硬撑下去。为了减轻粉坊开支，叫组员在家里吃饭，替粉坊干活。大家不愿意，就按劳力硬派。这样一来，组员的意见更多了。直到后来死了两条猪，粉坊才停下来。
    二十户组员住得很分散，缺乏领导骨干，组长本人在群众中也没有威信。当时桃溪区委强调“农副业结合”，看见傅先廷组里有副业，就确定为试办社的对象。一九五二年十一月初，县委派了干部去调查这个组够不够办社条件。在组员会上，傅先廷介绍组内情况后说：“我们组基础不好，土地、村庄分散，组员生活困难，恐怕办不好，干垮了以后多丢脸。让人家先干，等别人干好了我们再干。”来调查的干部认为他落后，就气得把本子一扔，说：“你这个组长落后，不想干！你们组内情况我知道，听区里介绍，你们组肥猪有十七八条，长得很肥胖；粉坊赚了一百多万元，组员办社劲头都很大。你为什么说怕办不好？不愿干？组员生活困难，每个组员政府给十石米。”他这一发脾气，很多不愿干的也不敢讲了；有的听说“给十石米”，也愿干了。所以在会上问大家同不同意办社时，都说“同意”。他并没有了解组里真实情况，就回去汇报了。县委听取他的汇报，批准了办社。组长傅先廷本来不愿办社，看到别人都要干，又怕人家说他落后，为了想得到上级的信任，想当社长，便又假装积极；组员洪克俊为了“争光荣”也很积极；组员赵本周听到办社干部对他说“这个组只有你一人有些文化，社办起来你搞会计，发展到五十户就能成为脱离生产的干部。”他本来不愿办社，为了想当干部，又想政府贷款，就积极起来。办社的干部就抓住了这三个思想动机不同的“积极分子”，去动员群众入社。组员们本来被调查的干部吓唬了一下，生活困难的又想得“十石米”，还有的是为了“争光荣”，随大帮。因此，在建社的第一阶段，表面上看像是“自愿入社”的。
    到讨论土地和劳力的分配比例时，只有一户提出按地四劳六分红，其余的都同意对半分红。领导上没有采纳多数社员的意见，最后确定按四六分。有些组员算算账要吃亏，不愿意，办社干部就分头去动员，三个积极分子也来帮助。他们怕不入社将来要孤立、受打击，就勉强答应了。水车折价入社，规定三年还清价款；组员王正奎不愿意，办社干部就问他“为什么不干？什么思想？”他被吓住不敢再讲了。酝酿选举社里干部时，傅先廷就拉拢一些组员选他当社长，并说不选他当社长他就不入社，办社干部也迁就了他。一切都准备好了，要在十二月二十日召开社员入社大会；可是有五户因为不愿意傅先廷当社长，又怕吃亏，提出要退出。结果，入社大会没开成。办社干部为了“完成任务”，又召开大会、小会，进行动员。几个“积极分子”怕社办不起来丢脸，也帮助动员。组员傅先明、石逢允算算账要吃亏四、五石稻，不愿入社；区委书记和县农会主任都住在他们家里，天天劝他们入社。办社干部简单生硬地向他们说：“你不入社，还想单干发财，走资本主义道路吗？”经过三番五次地硬动员，他们怕不入社不行，才勉强入了社。还有三户不愿入社，把他们叫到区里去教育了也不愿入。最后，就把表示“愿入社”的十七户组成了一个农业生产合作社。
    社里虽也选了正副社长，建立了各种组织机构，但是社长傅先廷想以社长身份沾点便宜，生产上不能带头，作风也不民主。社里整个生产没有计划，劳动力也没有适当的调配，每天干活临时想、临时分配。每天晚上开会评分，争多叫少，吵到半夜，早上起不来，干活不起劲。社外农民一天早起晚睡能栽一亩八分田，他们每天每人只栽了九分田。合作社薅草也不如单干农民和互助组。结果，产量大大降低。他们在生产上不计算成本，多花了很多钱。社员对社内的牲畜农具也不爱护。社内评工记分办法不合理，社员的劳动积极性受到很大影响，许多人“混工”，劳动积极的还受到讽刺。
    到秋收时，产量很低，每亩平均收稻三百七十斤五两，比附近单干农民少五十四斤十一两，比互助组少一百二十九斤十一两。总产量比建社前少二千七百零五斤。同时，开支也很大，把请短工、买肥料、买牛草料和农具的折旧、损失等扣除了，实际收入就更少了。分红结果，有九户减少收入，最多的比入社前少收一千九百多斤稻；有四户收入和入社前一样，只有四户土地少、劳力多的收入略为多些。这样，大多数社员都不愿意干了。
    在傅先廷农业生产合作社成立以后，县委和区委也常派干部来跑跑望望，但是都停不久。先后一共派来又调走十三个干部，刚摸到一点情况就被调走了。因此，社里的问题一直没有得到解决。一九五三年九月，群众学习了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议，都愿意改成互助组。大家都认为：毛主席指引我们组织起来的道路是好的，只怪我们互助基础不好，没有经验，又没有好的领导骨干，才搞得这样一团糟。大家表示改组后一定好好干，够条件了再办社。
    中共舒城县委总结了这两个试办社的情况，找出了办好和办坏的原因，以便在今后办社中记取这些经验和教训。
