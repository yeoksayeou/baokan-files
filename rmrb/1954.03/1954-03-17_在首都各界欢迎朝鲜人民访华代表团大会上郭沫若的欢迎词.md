Comrades, Dear Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China and all the representatives:

    Please allow me, on behalf of the people of the capital of China, to express our heartfelt and warm welcome to Comrade Kim Ung-gi, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, and all the representatives. At the same time, I would like to extend our brotherly and cordial greetings to the heroic Korean people through you.

    The Korean People's Delegation to China will visit our country for three months, introducing to our people the heroic struggle of the Korean people against American imperialism in the heroic war of defending their country and the situation of reconstruction after the armistice, and will also visit various aspects of our country's construction. This is another manifestation of the close friendship between the Chinese and Korean people after the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. There is no doubt that through the visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China, the traditional friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

    As our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The heroic struggle of the Korean people for the independence and liberation of their motherland and against the American imperialist aggressors has made a great contribution to the cause of saving world peace."

    The Chinese people are deeply proud and honored to have such a heroic neighbor.

    The Korean people defeated the American imperialist aggression, not only defending the independence and freedom of Korea, but also ensuring the security of our country. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Korean people here.

    In the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese people deeply realized that China and Korea are as closely related as lips and teeth. The close unity of the Chinese and Korean people, and the close unity of all countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, were, and will always be, our invincible force against aggression and in defense of world peace. We must cherish this unity and friendship as we cherish our eyes.

    The destinies of our two peoples are so closely linked, and the friendship forged in blood between the two peoples is so unbreakable. We Chinese people must continue to deepen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, support your reconstruction work, and at the same time fight to the end for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We firmly believe that the heroic Korean people who defeated American imperialist aggression, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, will surely achieve great success in the glorious cause of establishing a peaceful, unified, and independent Korea.

    Let us warmly wish the Korean People's Delegation to China a complete success in its work, and sincerely wish all the comrades of the delegation good health.

    Finally, let us shout:

    Long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    在首都各界欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团大会上郭沫若的欢迎词
    亲爱的朝鲜人民访华代表团团长和全体代表们、同志们：
    请允许我首先代表中国首都各界人民向朝鲜人民访华代表团金应基团长和全体代表同志们，表示衷心的、热烈的欢迎，同时并通过你们向英雄的朝鲜人民致以兄弟般的亲切的敬礼。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团将在我国作三个月的访问，向我国人民介绍朝鲜人民在英勇的卫国战争中反对美帝国主义的英勇斗争和停战后进行恢复建设的情况，并将参观我国各方面的建设。这是继中朝两国签订经济及文化合作协定之后，中朝人民亲密友谊的又一表现。毫无疑义，经过朝鲜人民访华代表团的访问，将会更进一步地巩固与发展我们朝中两国人民的传统友谊和互助合作。
    正如我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说的：“朝鲜人民为争取祖国独立解放、反对美帝国主义侵略者的英勇斗争，对拯救世界和平的事业作了巨大贡献。”
    中国人民深以有这样一个英雄的邻邦而感到骄傲和光荣。
    朝鲜人民打败美帝国主义的侵略，不但保卫了朝鲜的独立与自由，而且也保障了我国的安全。我们在这里向朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，深刻认识到中朝两国唇齿相依，休戚相关。中朝两国人民的紧密团结、以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国的紧密团结，过去是，将来永远是我们反对侵略、保卫世界和平的不可战胜的力量。我们要像珍爱我们眼睛一样去珍爱这种团结和友谊。
    我们中朝两国人民的命运是如此密切地连结在一起，两国人民以鲜血结成的友谊又是如此牢不可破，我们中国人民一定继续深入抗美援朝运动，支援你们的重建工作，同时为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗到底。我们深信：战胜了美帝国主义侵略的英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党与金日成元帅领导下，在建立和平、统一、独立的朝鲜的光荣事业上，定将获得巨大成就。
    让我们热烈预祝朝鲜人民访华代表团在工作中获得圆满成功，敬祝代表团全体同志们身体健康。
    最后让我们高呼：
    中朝人民团结万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    金日成元帅万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营万岁！
