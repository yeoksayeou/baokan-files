Jinan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Worker Gao Jixiang
Sets Plan to Complete Two Years' Work in One Year
    Gao Jixiang, a worker in the mechanical workshop of the Jinan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, has set a production plan to complete two years' worth of work in one year.

    After studying the general line, Gao Jixiang enhanced his class consciousness and labor enthusiasm, and resolved to learn from Wang Chonglun's spirit of creation and improve production efficiency. He summarized his work in 1953, identified experiences and lessons, tapped production potential, and formulated an advanced production plan to complete two years' work in one year. The basis of this plan is: the fixed work hours for each locomotive part he processes is 1,871 minutes, and the actual working time for the whole year is 146,880 minutes, so the task for one year is to process parts for 78.5 locomotives. Now he proposes to shorten the processing time of each locomotive part by more than half, so he can complete the processing of parts for more than 160 locomotives in one year. The factory's repair task for the whole year is only 138 locomotives, so he decided to use the remaining time to process 4,800 pipe joints. Thus, calculated by work hours, he will complete two years and one month's work in one year.

    Gao Jixiang's method to complete this advanced plan is to improve production technology. As of February 22nd, he has put forward 19 rationalization proposals for improving tools, promoting advanced experience, and reducing auxiliary time, and nine of them have been implemented, all of which have increased efficiency by more than double. For example, in order to tap the potential of the machine, he increased the pulley, and the lathe's rotation speed has increased from 490 revolutions per minute to 740 revolutions per minute. He also uses cemented carbide tools on more than 80% of the workpieces, increasing the cutting speed from 30-110 meters per minute to 150-280 meters per minute. He learned the Kolesov tool method and the offset cutting method, increasing the feed rate from 0.2-0.4 mm to 0.5-0.8 mm. He also created a universal thimble tool, which can improve efficiency in processing more than 65% of the workpieces. For general tapping and boring processing, he used multi-tool multi-blade cutting method and template tools, composite tools, etc. In order to shorten auxiliary time and reduce downtime, he also improved the chucking tool, increasing the machine utilization rate from the current 40% to 70%. He not only guarantees to overfulfill the plan in quantity, but also uses the three-inspection system (group leader inspection, mutual inspection, quality officer inspection) to ensure that the quality of all products reaches 100%.

    Now, the processing efficiency of the parts he processes has been significantly improved. For example, processing the heating pipe elbow used to take 65 minutes according to the quota, but now it only takes 15 minutes, increasing production efficiency by more than three times. Processing the large water pump inlet pipe nozzle used to have a quota of 42 minutes, but after he used the Kolesov tool method, it only took 15 minutes to complete, increasing efficiency by nearly two times. Now, he is actively implementing his production plan with creative labor.

    订出一年完成两年工作量计划
    济南机车车辆修理工厂机械车间工人高吉祥，订出一年完成两年工作量的生产计划。
    高吉祥学习了总路线，提高了阶级觉悟和劳动热情，决心学习王崇伦的创造精神，提高生产效率。他总结了一九五三年的工作，找出经验教训，挖掘了生产潜力，订出一年完成两年工作量的先进生产计划。这一计划的根据是：他加工的每台机车零件的定额工时是一千八百七十一分钟，全年实际工作时间是十四万六千八百八十分钟，因此一年的任务是加工七十八点五台车的零件。现在他提出来每台机车零件加工时间缩短一半多，因此一年能完成一百六十多台车的零件加工工作。该厂今年全年修车任务只有一百三十八台，他决定利用剩余时间加工四千八百个管子节。这样，按工时计算，即一年完成两年零一个月的工作量。
    高吉祥完成这一先进计划的办法是改进生产技术。到二月二十二日为止，他已提出十九项改进工具、推广先进经验、减少辅助时间的合理化建议，并有九项已经实现，都提高效率一倍以上。如：他为了挖掘机器潜力，加大了皮带轮，车床的转数已由每分钟四百九十转提高到七百四十转，并在百分之八十以上的工作物上，使用硬质合金刀，切削速度由每分钟三十公尺至一百一十公尺提高到一百五十公尺至二百八十公尺。他学习了科列索夫车刀法和偏刀切削法，使走刀量由零点二至零点四米厘提高到零点五至零点八米厘。他还创造了万能顶针工具，加工百分之六十五以上的工作物，都能提高效率。他对一般挑丝挖眼的加工，利用了多刀多刃切削法和样板刀、符合刀具等。他为缩短辅助时间，减少中断时间，还改进了卡活工具，使机器利用率由现在百分之四十提高到百分之七十。他不但保证在数量上超额完成计划，并用三检制（组长检查、互相检查、质量干事检查）的办法，保证所有产品的质量达到百分之百。
    现在，他加工的零件，加工效率已有显著提高。如加工暖气管弯头，过去定额工时是六十五分钟一个，现在只用十五分钟，提高生产效率三倍多。加工大号水泵进水管嘴，定额工时为四十二分钟，他使用了科列索夫车刀法后，只用十五分钟就完成了，提高效率近两倍。现在，他正以创造性的劳动，积极执行他的生产计划。
