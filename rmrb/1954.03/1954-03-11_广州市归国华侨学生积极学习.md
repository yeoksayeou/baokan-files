    Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Students Actively Study
    Under the cultivation and education of the motherland, overseas Chinese students in Guangzhou's universities, middle schools, and primary schools are gradually growing into well-rounded students. According to the results of the final exams in the winter vacation, the academic performance of overseas Chinese students in various schools is very good. All overseas Chinese students at South China Normal College passed the semester exams, and many students scored full marks in their major subjects. Among the 27 overseas Chinese students in the senior year of Overseas Chinese Middle School, nine received awards for excellence and good performance. Among the seventeen overseas Chinese students in Class C of the fourth central primary school in the East District, where the largest number of overseas Chinese primary school students are concentrated, twelve students achieved excellent grades in their major subjects.
