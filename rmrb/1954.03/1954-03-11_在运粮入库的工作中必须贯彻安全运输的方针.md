    In the Work of Transporting Grain into Warehouses, We Must Implement the Policy of Safe Transportation
      Editor's Note: Transporting grain into warehouses is
  a strenuous and arduous task. Currently, various localities are seizing
  the gaps before spring plowing to concentrate grain into warehouses. To
  mobilize a large amount of manpower, livestock, and vehicles within a short
  period before spring plowing to complete the massive transportation task,
  detailed leadership and strict organizational work are essential. According
  to readers' letters, the relaxation of leadership over grain transportation by
  certain county and district leading organs has resulted in casualties
  involving people and animals. This situation should attract the attention of
  various localities to prevent similar accidents from happening.
    (I)
    Sun Baozhong and Jiao Xingcheng of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Daxing County, Hebei Province, wrote: In the work of transporting grain into warehouses in Daxing County, some county and district leading cadres believed that such large grain requisition and warehousing tasks had been completed in the past without any problems, so there was nothing to worry about this year. As a result, they were negligent and only made general arrangements for the work, lacking specific leadership and inspection. Many villages did not conduct safety education for the masses participating in transportation, and the personnel, animals, and vehicles were not carefully inspected and organized into teams, nor were special personnel assigned to lead and escort them, resulting in serious chaos. For example, when Mag 각 zhuang Village was transporting grain into warehouses, the comrades of the district working group simply said at a mass meeting: "Loaded carts are not allowed to sleep, and empty carts are not allowed to overtake"; only after the grain carts left the village were they organized into groups according to the order of the ranks, resulting in chaotic order and accidents.
    The lack of planning in organizing warehousing is also one of the causes of accidents. Although each grain receiving point also stipulates the daily warehousing quota for each district, each district often does not follow the plan in order to complete the warehousing task ahead of schedule. For example, the Pang 각 zhuang grain receiving point can only warehouse 300,000 catties of grain per day, but one day it transported 500,000 catties. As a result, the grain carts were crowded together, which not only affected the grain receiving and warehousing time but also easily caused accidents.
    (II)
    Huang Yongxing, Wan Xudong, Qu Hezhong and others from the Grain Bureau of Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, wrote: In the work of transporting grain into warehouses in Xincai, Xi, and Suiping Counties in Xinyang Prefecture, livestock casualties occurred. The main reason is that the local party and government leading organs do not have a sufficient understanding of the arduousness of this work and have relaxed in-depth leadership and inspection, so that many grain delivery teams lack strict organization. Moreover, individual counties have made subjectivist mistakes in arranging grain transportation tasks. For example, Xincai County once arranged to complete the huge transportation task of 5 million catties of grain within two days. As a result, a lot of effort was spent on mobilization, and only 3.8 million catties of grain were concentrated for transportation within two days, and livestock deaths occurred.
    In order to effectively do a good job in the centralized transportation of grain and implement the policy of safe transportation when transporting grain into warehouses, the leading departments of various localities, especially the county and district leading organs, should strengthen specific leadership work: before grain transportation, the grain departments must make an overall plan, and the necessary roads and bridges should be inspected and repaired; the personnel participating in transportation should be fully educated on safe transportation, and those who lack the conditions to participate in long-distance transportation, such as people, livestock, and vehicles, should be dissuaded from participating in the grain transportation team, so as to truly achieve "three hards" (hard people, hard vehicles, hard livestock) and "four adequacies" (adequate matching, adequate driving, adequate feeding and drinking, adequate rest). In the centralized transportation of grain, each district and township must assign a certain number of cadres to follow the vehicles and lead the team separately. The grain receiving points in various localities should also do a good job in all preparations, such as providing tea and water in a timely manner and preparing rest places, and the grain receiving procedures should also be simplified as much as possible.

### 在运粮入库的工作中必须贯彻安全运输的方针

专栏：读者来信摘要

    在运粮入库的工作中必须贯彻安全运输的方针
      编者按：运粮入库是一项繁重而艰巨的任
  务。目前各地正在抓紧春耕前的空隙，把粮食
  集中入库。要在春耕生产前短时期内，动员大
  量的人力、畜力和车辆，来完成巨大的运输任
  务，就必须有细致的领导工作和严密的组织工
  作。据读者来信反映，由于某些县、区领导机
  关放松对粮食运输的领导，以致造成了人、畜
  伤亡事故。这种情况，应引起各地注意，以免
  发生类似事故。
    （一）
    中共河北省大兴县委员会孙宝重、焦兴成来信：大兴县在运粮入库工作中，某些县、区领导干部认为过去征粮入库任务那么大，都没有发生问题，今年还担心啥，因而麻痹大意，对于工作只作一般化的布置，而缺乏具体的领导和检查。不少村根本没有向参加运输的群众进行安全教育，人、畜、车辆也没有认真的检查和编队，更没有指定专人负责领队押运，因此造成了严重的混乱现象。如马各庄村在运粮入库时，区工作组同志仅在群众会上简单地说：“重车不准睡觉，空车也不得超先”；等到运粮大车出村后才按着行列次序编成小组，结果秩序混乱，造成了事故。
    组织入库时缺乏计划，也是造成事故的原因之一。各个接粮点虽然也规定了每区每天的入库额，但各区往往为了提前完成入库任务，都不按计划执行。如庞各庄接粮点每天只能入库三十万斤粮，但有一天就运来了五十万斤。结果送粮大车互相拥挤，不仅影响了接收入库时间，而且容易造成事故。
    （二）
    河南省信阳专署粮食局黄永性、万旭东、曲合中等来信：信阳专区新蔡、息县、遂平等县在运粮入库工作中，发生了牲畜伤亡事故。其原因主要是当地党政领导机关对这个工作的艰巨性认识不足，放松了深入领导和检查，以致很多送粮队都缺乏严密的组织。更有个别县在布置运粮任务时犯了主观主义的毛病。如新蔡县曾布置要把五百万斤粮的庞大运输任务在两天之内完成，结果下面费了很大力气进行动员，两天内只集中运输了三百八十万斤粮，并发生了牲畜死亡的事故。
    为了切实做好粮食集中运输工作，并在运粮入库时贯彻安全运输的方针，各地领导部门，特别是县、区领导机关应该加强具体领导工作：在运粮前粮食部门必须作出通盘的计划，必经的道路和桥梁应进行必要的检修；对参加运输的人员应该充分进行安全运输教育，并劝止缺乏条件参加较长途运输的人、牲口和车辆不要参加运粮队，以切实作到“三硬”（人硬、车硬、牲口硬）“四当”（配套当、行车当、喂饮当、休息当）。各区、乡在集中运输粮食中，必须抽出一定数量的干部分头跟车领队。各地接粮点也要做好一切准备工作，如及时地供应茶水和准备休息场所等，接粮的手续也要尽可能地简化。
