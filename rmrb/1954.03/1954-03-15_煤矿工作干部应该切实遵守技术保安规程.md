    Coal Mine Cadres Should Conscientiously Abide by Technical Safety Regulations
    Reader Yue Laixi and others wrote: On February 1st, a major accident occurred in the Nanguan pit of the Fujiatan Coal Mine in Shanxi Province (a local state-owned enterprise) during the renovation of the haulage road project. It violated the coal mine technical safety regulations, resulting in the death of repair worker Li Huai and injuries to support worker Song Changming. In the past, the pit often used black powder and potassium chlorate explosives during mining, which easily caused accidents where workers were overcome by blasting fumes. This was both unsafe and inefficient in terms of production. Therefore, starting in the fourth quarter of last year, it gradually switched to using ammonium nitrate explosives. Safety regulations stipulate that electric detonators must be used to ignite this type of explosive, and the use of electric light wires for blasting is strictly prohibited. At a production meeting on December 25th of last year, leading cadres of the Fujiatan Coal Mine repeatedly gave instructions on this matter. However, Wu Kangtian, the deputy director in charge of production at the pit, did not comply with this regulation. He grumbled behind his back, saying: "If we have to complete the state's tasks, we will be afraid of violating safety regulations!" On January 24th, the repair team of the pit came to collect "electric detonators" from the inventory, but Wu Kangtian refused to issue them. On the morning of February 1st, Wu Kangtian entered the pit to inspect the work. Seeing that the workers in the repair team were preparing to use electric light wires for blasting, he did not stop them. The workers started blasting according to Wu Kangtian's instructions, which eventually led to the major accident.
    After the accident, all the workers in the pit were very uneasy, and the attendance rate dropped significantly. From February 1st to 17th (excluding holidays and days off), the operation plan was only 83.91% completed over thirteen days. Not a single day saw the completion of the daily plan.
    Although Wu Kangtian is the deputy director in charge of production at the Nanguan pit, he has consistently ignored safe production. On October 29th of last year, he took the lead in "back-hauling" (manually pushing coal cars), causing accidents such as the injury of worker Zhang Tie'er. This time, he intentionally violated safety regulations, resulting in a major accident. Afterwards, he shirked responsibility and said to the workers: "Accidents are unavoidable in coal mines!" This irresponsible attitude towards the safety of workers' lives is intolerable. It is recommended that the Fujiatan Coal Mine give him the punishment he deserves.
    Editor's Note: Ensuring the safe production of employees is one of the important responsibilities of leading cadres in factories and mines. In the past, most of the major accidents that occurred in some factories and mines were due to the violation of technical safety regulations and neglect of safe production by management cadres. Reader Zhang Hai'ao's letter reflects that among the accidents that occurred at the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau last year, those caused by violations of coal mine technical safety regulations in production management accounted for 85.7%. For example, the roof of the East Seventh Road roadway in the Third Pit had high pressure, and the supports were in danger of being crushed. However, the management personnel did not take necessary measures, resulting in a coal car hitting a support leg, causing the support beam to fall and kill a worker. Also, reader Shao Yanxiang's letter reflects that among the accidents in the mines under the Fushun Mining Bureau last year, those caused by grassroots cadres "leading the way" in violating coal mine technical safety regulations accounted for 65.5%, and those caused by cadres and workers jointly violating safety regulations accounted for 30.8%. For example, Zhang Guogui, the section chief of the stripping section of the Fushun Open-pit Mine, once asked an electric pick driver to use an electric pick to lift a drill in violation of regulations; when the driver was unwilling, the section chief "guaranteed" it. As a result, the steel wire rope broke, the drill was damaged, and national property suffered losses.
    Some coal mine cadres do not have the concept of safe production and oppose safety and production, they only pay attention to production and ignore safety, and even believe that accidents are unavoidable if production tasks are to be completed. For example, Wang Zhenqing, the district chief of the first pit of the Ping'an Mine of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, used a 25.5-meter-long blasting wire (the regulations require 30 meters) to detonate in the West Ninth Road coal mining face. Jin Wanyuan, the pit entrance inspector, discovered this and stopped him. Wang Zhenqing did not accept the opinion and quarreled with Jin Wanyuan. Hou Kuiyuan, the deputy secretary of the Ping'an Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China and the secretary of the first pit branch, instead criticized Jin Wanyuan for "not having a production perspective," saying, "If you continue like this, I will dismiss you!" Because leading cadres neglect safety work in this way, lower-level staff do not take the safety system seriously. As a result, accidents occur continuously, and production also suffers.
    Combining production and safety is an issue that must be emphasized in the coal mining industry. It is hoped that the leading bodies of coal mines in various regions will learn from the above lessons, educate cadres to pay serious attention to safety work, abide by technical safety regulations, prevent accidents, and further improve production.

### 煤矿工作干部应该切实遵守技术保安规程

专栏：读者来信摘要

    煤矿工作干部应该切实遵守技术保安规程
    读者岳来喜等来信：二月一日，山西省地方国营富家滩煤矿南关坑在整修运搬道工程中，违反煤矿技术保安规程，发生炸死修理工李怀、炸伤支柱工宋长命的重大事故。该坑过去采掘时经常使用黑火药和氯酸钾炸药，容易发生炮烟薰倒工人事故，既不安全，生产效率又不高；因此，从去年第四季度起就逐步改用硝安炸药。保安规程上规定燃点这种炸药，必须使用电气放炮器，严禁用电灯线放炮。在去年十二月二十五日的生产会议上，富家滩煤矿的领导干部对此反复作了指示。但该坑负责生产的副主任吴康田却不遵守这个规定。他在背后发牢骚说：“既要完成国家任务，还怕违反保安规程！”一月二十四日，该坑修理队来领库存的“电气放炮器”，吴康田拒绝发给。二月一日上午，吴康田进坑检查工作，看到修理队工人准备用电灯线放炮，也不加以制止，工人按着吴康田的指示开始放炮，终于发生了重大事故。
    事故发生后，全坑职工十分不安，出勤率显著降低。二月份一至十七日（例假、公休除外）十三天，只完成了作业计划的百分之八十三点九一。没有一天是完成日计划的。
    吴康田虽然身为南关坑负责生产的副主任，但一贯忽视安全生产。去年十月二十九日他带头“背车”，造成撞伤工人张铁儿等事故。这次又有意破坏保安规程，造成重大事故。事后，他还推卸责任，并向工人说：“煤矿上哪能避免事故！”这种对工人生命安全采取不负责任的态度，是不能容忍的。建议富家滩煤矿给他以应得的处分。
    编者按：保证职工安全生产是厂矿企业领导干部重要职责之一。过去有的厂矿发生的重大事故，绝大部分是由于管理工作干部违反技术保安规程，忽视安全生产所致。读者张海鳌来信反映阜新矿务局平安矿去年发生的事故中，因生产管理违反煤矿技术保安规程而造成的，占百分之八十五点七。例如三坑东七路大巷顶板压力大，棚子有被压垮之势，但管理人员没有采取必要措施，以致煤车撞着棚子腿，棚梁子脱落，砸死了一个工人。又如读者邵燕祥来信反映去年抚顺矿务局所属各矿的事故中，因基层干部“带头”违反煤矿技术保安规程而发生的占百分之六十五点五，干部和工人共同违反保安规程而造成的占百分之三十点八。如抚顺露天矿剥离段段长张国贵曾让电镐司机违反规程，用电镐吊地钻；司机不愿意，段长就给“打保证”。结果钢丝绳折断了，地钻打坏了，国家财产遭受了损失。
    有些煤矿干部没有安全生产的观点，而把安全与生产对立起来，他们只重视生产而不管安全，甚至认为要完成生产任务就不能不出事故。如阜新矿务局平安矿一坑区长王振清曾在西九路采煤掌子用二十五点五公尺长的炮线（按规定应为三十公尺）放炮，坑口检查员金万元发现后加以制止。王振清不接受意见，和金万元争吵起来。中共平安煤矿委员会副书记兼一坑支部书记侯魁元反而批评金万元“没有生产观点”，说“再这样撤你的职！”由于领导干部这样忽视保安工作，下级工作人员也就不把保安制度当作一回事了。结果是事故不断发生，生产也受到了损失。
    把生产和安全结合起来，是煤矿工业中必须重视的问题。希望各地煤矿领导方面接受以上教训，教育干部切实重视保安工作，遵守技术保安规程，防止事故，进一步搞好生产。
