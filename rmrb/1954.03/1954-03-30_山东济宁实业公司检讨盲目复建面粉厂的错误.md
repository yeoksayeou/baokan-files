    Shandong Jining Industrial Company Reviews Error of Blindly Rebuilding Flour Mill
    Letter from Shandong Jining Industrial Company: The criticism made by a reader in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on October 26th last year regarding the waste in the reconstruction project of the Jining Flour Mill (hereinafter referred to as the Flour Mill) under our company (Editor's Note: the original criticism mistakenly identified it as Shandong Province Industrial Company) is fundamentally correct. In June 1952, the Flour Mill suffered a fire due to improper operation, causing undue losses to the people. Afterwards, in addition to taking action against those responsible for the negligence, we also proposed to the higher authorities to rebuild the mill based on need. Initially, we did not have high demands for the reconstruction, and the machinery planned for use was relatively simple, with reconstruction costs estimated at 900 million yuan. However, due to the influence of the "love of greatness and eagerness for success" mentality, as well as an incorrect assessment of the market supply and demand situation for flour, we repeatedly increased the investment figures and expanded the construction scale, resulting in a loss of state property.
    Since the higher authorities decided to halt the construction of the Flour Mill, we have been actively resettling workers and clearing materials. However, Comrade Wei Fu's suggestion has been of great help to our work. In addition to further improving the aftermath work of the Flour Mill, we are determined to accept this lesson and, in future capital construction work, we must proceed from the actual situation and overall interests to avoid similar errors.

### 山东济宁实业公司检讨盲目复建面粉厂的错误

    山东济宁实业公司检讨盲目复建面粉厂的错误
    山东济宁实业公司来信：去年十月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者对本公司（编者按：原批评中误为山东省实业公司）所属济宁面粉厂（以下简称面粉厂）复厂工程中浪费现象的批评，基本上是正确的。一九五二年六月，面粉厂由于操作不慎，发生火灾，给人民造成了不应有的损失。事后，我们除对失职人员作了处理外，并根据需要向上级提议复厂。起初我们对复厂要求不高，计划使用的机械也较简陋，复厂费预计九亿元。但是，由于“好大喜功”的思想作祟，以及对市场面粉供销情况估计错误，我们又一再追加投资数字，扩大建筑规模，以致造成了国家财产的损失。
    自上级决定面粉厂停建后，我们就积极安置工人，清理物资。但是，蔚馥同志的建议对我们工作的帮助仍是很大的。我们除进一步作好面粉厂的善后工作外，并决心接受这个教训，在今后基本建设工作中一定要从实际情况和整体利益出发，避免发生类似错误。
