Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The Soviet Union's proposals for resolving European issues, presented at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, have had a significant impact on political life in Western Europe. Following the Berlin Conference, the sentiment among people of all strata in Western Europe demanding further consultation with the Soviet Union by Western countries has intensified, and the forces opposing the United States' policies of dividing Europe and rearming West Germany have grown stronger.

Prior to the Berlin Conference, the United States had intended to use the conference to demonstrate to the people of Western Europe that "negotiations with the Soviet Union are futile" in order to reduce resistance to the US promotion of the "European Army" plan. However, this American scheme failed miserably. After the conference, a "New York Herald Tribune" reporter said, "US officials admitted that the Eisenhower administration had originally hoped before the Berlin Conference to use the meeting to prove that 'Soviet foreign policy is unreasonable,' but this hope was dashed."

The series of constructive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference to ensure European security and resolve the German problem, especially the proposal to establish a European collective security system, have been widely responded to and supported by the public in Western European countries. They believe that the Soviet proposal for establishing a European collective security system points out a reliable way for all-European cooperation to ensure European peace and security and prevent the revival of West German militarism. These proposals have aroused particularly enthusiastic reactions in France and Germany. The London "Times" emphasized that the Soviet proposals have a special appeal to some French and Germans. Even the American "New York Times" reporter had to admit that the Soviet proposals would be welcomed by those Europeans who oppose the Americans and believe that Europeans are fully capable of solving their own problems. The American "Nation" weekly said that although the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France rejected the Soviet proposal at the Berlin Conference, "comments in European newspapers and remarks by some European leaders indicate that this plan will continue to be discussed." "Newsweek" also said that "many commentators in Europe are considering the possibility of establishing an all-European organization, even though (or perhaps because) the United States is not participating in the organization proposed in this suggestion." The Italian semi-official "Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata" said that the Soviet proposal will become "an important factor greatly influencing the entire international situation."

Many newspapers of different persuasions in Western European countries have criticized the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France for hastily rejecting the Soviet proposals at the Berlin Conference. Contrary to American expectations, after the Berlin Conference, the calls in Western Europe for consultation with the Soviet Union on European issues have not decreased but increased. "New York World-Telegram and the Sun" correspondent in London, Sackville, reported that after the Berlin Conference, many "non-communists" in Britain, France, and West Germany advocated continued consultation with the Soviet Union. The British "News Chronicle" said in reporting the results of a reader survey that people were "more willing to consult with Russia on the German problem" than they were ten months ago. "After the Berlin Conference, the number of people advocating continued negotiations between the West and Russia has not decreased but increased." The situation is even more so in France. A recent open letter jointly published by twenty-two people, including French National Assembly Honorary Chairman Herriot and former Prime Minister Daladier, is an illustration of this. The open letter condemned West German militarization and said, "The signatories of the letter believe that efforts must be made to promote an agreement between East and West so that all European countries can unite on a broad basis without exception."

After the Berlin Conference, the US attempt to accelerate the establishment of the "European Army," aimed at dividing Europe and reviving West German militarism, encountered even greater resistance. The "New York Times," in a commentary entitled "Europe after the Berlin Conference," admitted that "the situation in France, West Germany, and Britain proves that although the governments in power support the European Defense Community Treaty, the movement against the treaty is growing." Under the influence of the widespread anti-"European Army" movement among the French people, the differences within many French bourgeois parties on the issue of whether to ratify the "European Army" treaty have become increasingly large. The United States originally hoped that the French National Assembly would immediately debate and ratify the "European Army" treaty after the Berlin Conference, but Reuters reporter Harold King reported on March 3 that "most members of the National Assembly believe that there is no reason to hastily make a decisive debate on the European Army." In Britain, after the Berlin Conference, the British Labour Party experienced serious divisions on the issue of rearming West Germany, with nearly half of the Labour MPs opposing the "European Army" policy maintained by the right-wing Labour leaders. The sentiment among Labour grassroots members against arming West Germany is also rising. The Associated Press admitted that this division of opinion within the British Labour Party has "frustrated" the US policy of accelerating the establishment of the "European Army." American news agencies have recently been constantly issuing an uneasy tone: the fate of the "European Army" is even more unpredictable.

### 苏联在柏林会议的建议深入人心   西欧各阶层人民要求和苏联协商

    苏联在柏林会议的建议深入人心
    西欧各阶层人民要求和苏联协商
    【新华社九日讯】苏联在柏林四国外长会议上提出的关于解决欧洲问题的建议在西欧政治生活中产生了巨大的影响。在柏林会议以后，西欧各阶层人民要求西方国家进一步和苏联协商的情绪更加高涨了，反对美国分裂欧洲、重新武装西德政策的势力更加增长了。
    在柏林会议以前，美国原想通过这次会议来向西欧人民证明“和苏联谈判是徒劳的”，以减少美国在推行“欧洲军”计划中所遭到的阻力。但是，美国这个阴谋可耻地失败了。在会议结束后，“纽约先驱论坛报”记者说，“美国官方人士承认，艾森豪威尔政府在柏林会议之前本来希望能借这个会议证明‘苏联的外交政策是没有道理的’，但是这种希望落空了。”
    苏联在柏林会议上提出的保障欧洲安全和解决德国问题的一系列建设性建议，特别是建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，获得了西欧国家广泛阶层公众的响应和支持。他们认为，苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议指出了全欧合作保障欧洲和平与安全、防止西德军国主义复活的可靠途径。这些建议在法国和德国引起了特别热烈的反应。伦敦“泰晤士报”着重指出，苏联的建议对某些法国人和德国人具有特殊的吸引力。连美国“纽约时报”记者也不得不承认，苏联的建议将得到那些反对美国人而认为欧洲人是完全能够解决他们自己的事情的欧洲人民的响应。美国“民族”周刊说，尽管美、英、法三国外长在柏林会议上拒绝了苏联的建议，“但是欧洲报纸的评论和欧洲某些领导人物的言论表明，这个计划将继续予以讨论”。“新闻周刊”也说，“欧洲许多评论家都在考虑建立全欧组织的可能性，尽管（或许是因为）美国不参加这个建议中的组织。”意大利半官方的“报信者报”说，苏联的建议将成为“大大影响整个国际形势的重要因素”。
    西欧国家许多不同倾向的报纸都指责美、英、法三国外长在柏林会议上轻率地拒绝了苏联的建议。和美国预期的相反，在柏林会议后，西欧要求在欧洲问题上与苏联协商的呼声不是减少了，而是增加了。“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”驻伦敦记者沙克福报道，柏林会议以后，英国、法国和西德的许多“非共产党人士”主张和苏联继续进行协商。英国“新闻纪事报”在报道征询读者意见的结果时说，柏林会议以后，人们比十个月以前“更愿意和俄国就德国问题进行协商了”。“在柏林会议以后，主张西方与俄国继续进行商谈的人，不但没有减少，反而增加了。”在法国，情形更是这样。包括法国国民议会名誉主席赫里欧、前总理达拉第在内的二十二人最近联名发表的一封公开信，就是一个说明。公开信谴责西德军国主义化，并说，“在信上签名的人认为必须努力促成东西方之间的协议，好让欧洲所有国家可以毫无例外地在广泛的基础上团结起来。”
    在柏林会议以后，美国要加速建立旨在分裂欧洲、复活西德军国主义的“欧洲军”的活动，遭到了更大的阻力。“纽约时报”在题为“柏林会议后的欧洲”一篇评论中承认，“法国、西德和英国的情况证明，尽管当政的政府支持欧洲防务集团条约，但反对这个条约的运动正在增长。”在法国人民广泛展开反对“欧洲军”运动的影响下，法国许多资产阶级政党内部在是否批准“欧洲军”条约问题上的分歧已越来越大。美国原来希望法国国民议会在柏林会议后马上辩论和批准“欧洲军”条约，但路透社记者哈罗德·金在三月三日报道说：“大多数国民议会议员都认为并无理由要仓促地对欧洲军进行决定性的辩论”。在英国，柏林会议以后，英国工党在重新武装西德问题上发生了严重的分歧，差不多有一半的工党议员反对工党右翼领袖所维护的“欧洲军”政策。工党基层党员反对武装西德的情绪也在高涨。美联社记者承认，英国工党这种意见分歧已使美国加速建立“欧洲军”的政策“遭到挫折”。美国通讯社最近在不断发出一种不安的论调：“欧洲军”的命运更加捉摸不定了。
