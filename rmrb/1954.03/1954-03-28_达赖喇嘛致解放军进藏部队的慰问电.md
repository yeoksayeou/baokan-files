    Dalai Lama's Message of Greetings to the PLA Troops Entering Tibet
    To Commander Zhang, Political Commissar Tan, and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet:
    The Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in Beijing, the capital of the motherland, in May 1951. According to the agreement, the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet. Over the past few years, it has driven out the imperialist invading forces from Tibet and consolidated national defense; at the same time, it has carried out important tasks such as reclaiming wasteland, building houses, opening hospitals and schools, preventing and controlling animal diseases, and establishing the People's Bank, as well as the Kangzang Highway currently under construction. These have a very significant impact on creating a happy life for the Tibetan people and developing various construction undertakings. In particular, in terms of the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, it can truly respect religions and customs. Since entering Tibet three years ago, not only has there been no incident that goes against the will of the entire clergy and laity, but it has also been wholeheartedly and impartially benefiting the masses, adhering strictly to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. Therefore, the current Tibetan clergy and laity sincerely believe in it, and the brotherly unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities will become stronger day by day. On the occasion of holding a grand comfort meeting in Lhasa, I would like to express my gratitude and greetings on behalf of the entire Tibetan clergy and laity. I also hope that all fraternal nationalities in China will unite as one, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, work together to build our great motherland and defend world peace.
                    Dalai Lama of the Tibetan Local Government
                          March 22, 1954
                      The 18th day of the intercalary first month of the Wood Horse Year in the Tibetan calendar

    达赖喇嘛致解放军进藏部队的慰问电
    张司令员、谭政治委员并人民解放军进藏部队全体指战员：
    中央人民政府及西藏地方政府于一九五一年五月间，在祖国首都北京签订了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。按照协议，人民解放军进入了西藏。几年来，从西藏驱逐了帝国主义侵略势力，巩固了国防；同时进行了开垦荒地、建筑房屋、开设医院、学校、防治兽疫及开办人民银行等各项重要工作，以及正在修筑中的康藏公路。这些对创造西藏人民的幸福生活和发展各项建设事业，都有着非常大的作用。尤其在解放军的纪律方面，对宗教及风俗习惯都能切实尊重。自进藏三年以来，不仅丝毫未发生与全体僧俗人民意志不符的事故，并且全系居心公正地谋利于大众，恪遵三大纪律、八项注意。因而，现今西藏僧俗人民都衷心信服，汉、藏民族兄弟般地团结会日趋坚强。值此在拉萨举行盛大慰问会之际，我代表西藏全体僧俗人民致以谢意，并致慰问。并望今后中国各兄弟民族团结一致，在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，为建设我们伟大的祖国，为保卫世界和平而共同努力。
