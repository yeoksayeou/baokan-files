To Successfully Lead Agriculture, One Must Understand the Business

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on January 15th, pointing out that leaders of Party and Soviet organizations in various regions must understand agriculture in order to do a good job of leading agriculture. The abstract is as follows:

    To complete the new, massive, and complex tasks in agriculture, Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and agricultural agencies are required to resolutely improve their leadership over collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

    To successfully lead agriculture, Party, Soviet, and agricultural agency workers must understand the business. The Party requires that its cadres responsible for leading agricultural production must understand agriculture, the leading sectors of agriculture, and the basic knowledge of agronomy and animal husbandry. Currently, when collective farms have become huge multi-sector economies and machine tractor stations have become the decisive force in rural areas, it is impossible to lead agriculture without a deep understanding and comprehensive study of agricultural economics and agronomy. For responsible personnel in the Ministry of Agriculture or instructors of Party district committees, it is no longer enough to understand agriculture "basically," "generally," and "vaguely." They must be thoroughly familiar with the principles of agriculture, cultivation, and animal husbandry, understand the advanced experience of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and not only understand but also be able to practically apply this or that advanced method.

    Among our local Party and Soviet leaders, there are many who are familiar with the business, persistently study agriculture, pay attention to newly published books, frequently meet with agricultural experts, and enthusiastically study their experience. However, there are also some workers who believe that since they have been assigned to leading positions, it is not necessary to learn and study the relevant economic business. Due to a lack of attention to studying the economics of collective farms and advanced experience, these workers only have a superficial understanding of the business, cannot truly help collective farms, and can only issue empty declarations and calls for shock work. Even some leaders of state Party and Soviet organizations are not very familiar with agriculture and are unwilling to study it, merely using general formulas and useless superficial instructions to perfunctorily deal with the matter.

    Party and Soviet leading cadres do not necessarily have to become agronomists, but they must be able to understand the problems in agriculture very well. And every worker, as long as he wants to become a truly good worker, can achieve this.

    We must resolutely eradicate the work style of half-baked knowledge. Our newspapers and periodicals should declare war on this work style and conduct merciless criticism and satire of those leaders who do not strive to study agriculture and only use bombastic talk to cover up their ignorance.

Improve the Teaching of Social Sciences in Universities

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on February 4th, titled "Improve the Teaching of Social Sciences in Universities." The abstract is as follows:

    The teaching of social sciences in universities plays a huge role in the ideological education of Soviet university students. Our university students, no matter what major they are studying, must understand the fundamental theories of Marxism-Leninism and be good at applying them to life. Studying Marxism-Leninism enables a deeper understanding of the Party's policies and successful implementation of them in practical activities, and fosters a spirit of loyalty to the Party's cause and the cause of communist construction.

    Party organizations constantly care about the improvement of social science teaching in universities and strengthen the supervision of the ideological content of lectures and classroom discussions. Recently, social science teaching and research offices in universities have made some improvements in the teaching of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, political economy, and philosophy, but they still cannot meet the growing demands. One of the most serious shortcomings in social science teaching in universities is still dogmatism and rote learning. Dogmatism castrates the fighting revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism, simplifies and vulgarizes theory, turns theoretical teaching into a collection of dead provisions and formulas, and reduces the lively interest in studying social sciences. In lectures and classroom discussions, often some memorized standard formulas are given, rather than creatively thinking about them, connecting them with reality, and connecting them with the practical tasks of communist construction.

    There are also serious shortcomings in the work of classroom discussions. As is well known, university students should develop the habit of speaking independently on theoretical issues in classroom discussions, should learn to adhere to their own views, and correctly express their thoughts. However, classroom discussions often become mere inquiries of students and are conducted lifelessly.

    Social science teaching and research offices in universities must strengthen the struggle to strive for highly ideological and creative teaching and to strive for an organic connection between teaching and the practice of communist construction. To achieve this, it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of the content of lectures and conduct comradely criticism of the shortcomings of some teachers.

    When elaborating on the historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union over the past 50 years, teachers must enable students to deeply study the main works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as the resolutions and other documents of the CPSU congresses. At the same time, lectures must fully explain the role of the people—the creators of history.

    Social science lectures and classroom discussions must be imbued with a fighting spirit and an irreconcilable spirit towards idealism and mysticism. At the same time, students should be educated with the spirit of Soviet patriotism and internationalism.

    Improving the teaching of social sciences is closely related to the development of scientific research work in teaching and research offices. The task of local Party organizations and university leaders is to deeply study the ideological content of social science teaching, summarize good experiences, and criticize the shortcomings in the work of teaching and research offices.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    通晓业务才能成功地领导农业
    “真理报”一月十五日发表社论，指出各地党和苏
  维埃的领导人必须懂得农业，才能做好对农业的领导
  工作，摘要如下：
    完成农业方面新的、巨大而复杂的任务，要求党组织、苏维埃和农业机关坚决改进对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导工作。
    党、苏维埃和农业机关的工作人员必须通晓业务才能成功地领导农业。党要求它的负责领导农业生产的干部必须懂得农业、农业的各主导部门以及农艺和饲畜业的基本知识。目前，当集体农庄已成为巨大的多部门经济，而机器拖拉机站已变成农村的决定性力量的时候，如果缺乏对农业经济和农艺学的深刻知识和全面的研究，要领导农业是不可能的。无论是就农业部的负责人员或是党的区委会的指导员来说，现在只是“基本上”“一般地和笼统地”懂得农业已经不够了。必须详细地熟悉农业、耕作和饲畜的原理，懂得集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的先进经验，不仅懂得而且还要能实际运用这种或那种先进方法。
    在我们地方党的和苏维埃的领导者中，有不少熟悉业务、坚持不懈地研究农业，注意新出版的书籍，经常同农业专家会晤，并热心研究他们的经验的人。但也有一些工作人员认为，既然他们已被派到领导工作岗位上去，那就不一定要学习和研究有关的经济业务了。由于不注意研究集体农庄的经济和先进经验，以致这些工作人员对业务只是一知半解，不能真正地给集体农庄以帮助，而只能发布空洞的宣言和号召对工作进行突击。甚至一些州的党和苏维埃组织的领导人对农业都不甚熟悉，并且也不愿意研究，只是用一般的公式和毫无用处的肤浅指示来敷衍搪塞。
    党和苏维埃的领导工作者不一定要成为农学家，但他们必须能很好地了解农业中的问题。而每一个工作人员，只要他想成为一个真正好的工作人员，是能够做到这点的。
    必须坚决地根除一知半解的工作作风。我们的报刊应当向这种作风宣战，并对那些不努力研究农业、只用夸夸其谈的方式来掩盖自己的不学无术的领导者，进行无情的批评和讽刺。
  改善高等学校中社会科学的教学工作
    “真理报”二月四日发表社论，题目是“改善高等
  学校中社会科学的教学工作”，摘要如下：
    高等学校中的社会科学教学工作，在苏联大学生的思想教育事业中，起着巨大的作用。我们的大学生，无论他学习的是那一种专业，他必须懂得马克思列宁主义理论基础并善于把它应用于生活中去。研究马克思列宁主义能够更深刻地理解共产党的政策并在实际活动中成功地实现它，能够培养对党的事业、对共产主义建设事业的忠诚精神。
    党组织不断关怀着高等学校中社会科学教学的改进，加强着对讲课和课堂讨论的思想内容的监督。近来高等学校社会科学教研室对马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学和哲学的教学工作，已有了某些改进，然而仍不能适应增长着的要求。高等学校社会科学教学中最严重的缺点之一，仍然是教条主义和死啃书本。教条主义阉割马克思列宁主义的战斗的革命精神，使理论单纯化和庸俗化，使理论教学成为死条文和公式的集合，削减了研究社会科学的生动兴趣。在讲课和课堂讨论中，时常是讲一些背熟了的标准公式，而不是创造性地加以思考，与实际联系，与共产主义建设的实际任务相联系。
    课堂讨论的工作中也有严重缺点。如所周知，大学生在课堂讨论中应养成对理论问题独立发言的习惯，应学会坚持自己的观点，正确叙述自己的思想。然而，课堂讨论却时常变成单纯对学生的询问，进行得毫无生气。
    高等学校的社会科学教研室必须加强争取教学的高度思想性和创造性的斗争，争取教学与共产主义建设实践的有机联系。要达到这一点，只有加强对讲课内容的监督，对某些教员的缺点进行同志般的批评。
    在阐述苏联共产党五十年来的历史经验时，教员必须使学生深刻研究马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的主要著作和苏共历届会议的决议及其他文件。同时，在讲课之中必须充分说明历史的创造者——人民的作用。
    社会科学的讲课和课堂讨论要贯穿着战斗的精神、对唯心论和神秘论不调和的精神。同时要教育大学生具有苏维埃的爱国主义和国际主义的精神。
    改善社会科学的教学工作，与教研室展开科学研究工作有着密切的联系。地方党组织和高等学校领导者的任务，是深刻研究社会科学教学的思想内容，总结优良经验和批评教研室工作中的缺点。
