The production of Shenyang's handicraft production cooperatives developed greatly last year, with profits of approximately 28.1 billion yuan, of which more than 13 billion yuan was specifically used for adding machinery and equipment from public accumulation funds. At the same time, with the development of industrial construction, the state manufactured presses for iron products production cooperatives, and textile machines for the miscellaneous textiles and silk thread industries production cooperatives; the state's electric power industry also prepared sufficient electricity for handicraft production cooperatives. Under these circumstances, many handicraft production cooperatives in Shenyang installed new machines. At present, nearly half of the city's eighty-one handicraft production cooperatives have begun mechanized and semi-mechanized production.

The members of Shenyang's First and Second Miscellaneous Textile Production Cooperatives have begun working in rows of automatically rotating machine rooms, no longer pedaling old-fashioned textile machines to weave scarves. The First Silk Thread Production Cooperative used to have four people spinning only six jin of silk thread a day; after switching to machine production, two people can spin nineteen jin a day. An old member of the Second Miscellaneous Textile Production Cooperative said excitedly after the cooperative installed new machines: "This time it's much easier, I'll be able to live ten years longer!"

    沈阳市手工业生产合作社纷纷安装机器
    沈阳市手工业生产合作社的生产去年有很大发展，盈利约二百八十一亿元，其中专门用来添置机器设备的公积金即在一百三十亿元以上。同时，随着工业建设的发展，国家为铁制品生产合作社制造了压力机，为杂纺、丝线两行业的生产合作社制造了纺织机；国家电力工业也为手工业生产合作社准备了充足的电力。在这样的情况下，沈阳市许多手工业生产合作社安装了新机器。目前，全市八十一个手工业生产合作社中，将近半数已开始了机械化、半机械化生产。
    沈阳市第一、第二杂纺生产合作社的社员们开始在一排排自动旋转的机器房工作，已经不再用脚来蹬着旧式纺织机织围巾了。第一丝线生产合作社过去四个人一天只能纺六斤丝线，改用机器生产后，两个人一天就能纺十九斤。第二杂纺生产合作社一个老社员在社里安上新机器以后兴奋地说：“这回省劲多了，我要能多活十年哪！”
