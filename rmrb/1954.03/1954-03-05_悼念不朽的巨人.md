    In Memory of the Immortal Giant
    Liang Sicheng
    A year ago. The train carrying the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union had been traveling within Soviet territory for five or six days. That morning, as the train's loudspeaker began broadcasting Moscow news, the laughter and conversations of the Soviet representatives sent by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to greet us, the Soviet attendants on the train, and the delegation's translators suddenly ceased. Their faces revealed a heavy and solemn expression. The news that "Comrade Stalin is seriously ill" shook the heart of every member of the delegation.
    On the morning of March 5th, we arrived in Moscow amidst heavy snowfall. The next day, in the dim light of dawn, I saw the Soviet national flag lowered to half-mast over the Kremlin from my hotel window and received the most unfortunate news: the great Stalin had forever departed from the humanity he loved.
    That day, our delegation held a memorial service. We also attended the memorial service held by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. President Nesmeyanov and many outstanding Soviet scientists spoke at the meeting, pledging to transform grief into strength, to follow the great Stalin's will, and to ensure that Soviet science occupies the first place in the world; they all described Comrade Stalin's great contributions to science with reverence. They were so grief-stricken, yet so resolute! I was deeply moved.
    In those sorrowful days, the entire city of Moscow, the entire Soviet Union, and hundreds of millions of good people around the world were mourning the fall of this giant star in unison. Countless young people, adults, and even elderly people made solemn oaths before the portrait of the great Stalin, to redouble their efforts in study and work, and to contribute all their strength to better strive for the cause of communism.
    On the day of the funeral, Comrade Malenkov, in a somber and resolute voice during the funeral ceremony, called on the people of the entire Soviet Union to transform grief into strength, inherit Comrade Stalin's legacy, and redouble their efforts to build a communist Soviet Union. He especially pointed out the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, as well as the unbreakable friendship with all people's democratic countries, and issued a serious warning to the imperialist aggressors. After the funeral, the Soviet national flag at the Kremlin was raised to the top of the flagpole again. It symbolized the invincible strength of the Soviet people, who would continue to advance along the victorious path opened up by the Leninist-Stalinist party.
    Subsequently, we spent about two months in the Soviet Union studying and visiting. As an architect, I could not help but notice the scientific and artistic achievements of Soviet architecture. I saw how the large and small cities of the Soviet Union, in accordance with Stalin's instructions, eliminated the slums left over from the capitalist era, how they developed on the basis of historically formed cities, and how they rationally arranged the city's industry, railway transportation, housing, streets, squares, parks, and all cultural and welfare buildings, and organized them with the natural environment to become an organic whole, a holistic artistic creation.
    The resolution on the "General Plan for the Reconstruction of Moscow," personally guided by Comrade Stalin, was announced in June 1935 by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Soviet Council of People's Commissars. This historical document pointed out the correct direction for future urban construction around the world, and thousands of cities and villages in the Soviet Union have already embodied Comrade Stalin's great idea. This holistic city, which provides meticulous care for all people in production, in life, in material terms, and in spiritual terms, is Comrade Stalin's unparalleled and supremely great contribution to the history of human urban construction. Not only in Moscow, from the skyscrapers piercing the clouds and the stations deep underground, from the small kitchens in new residences to the vast parks and squares, everywhere exudes Comrade Stalin's great idea of concern for the people. Moreover, in Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, and Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, as well as in many other cities and villages we saw, this Stalinist great idea of concern for the people also had a brilliant manifestation through the Soviet Communist Party's national policies.
    In those sorrowful days, the profound education I received from the Stalinist thought embodied in Soviet architecture will forever remain in my memory.
    The great teacher of the world communist movement, the great Stalin, has passed away for a year. Today, with reverence, I mourn this immortal giant. I firmly believe that Stalin's great spirit will always be with us, and progressive humanity around the world will tirelessly strive for the cause left behind by Stalin. Stalin will live forever!

    悼念不朽的巨人
    梁思成
    一年以前。中国科学院访苏代表团所乘坐的列车驶入苏联境内五六天了。那天早上，车上的广播器刚开始转播莫斯科新闻。苏联科学院派来迎接我们的代表、车上的苏联服务员和代表团的翻译同志们的谈笑突然停止了，他们的脸上露出了沉重而严肃的表情。“斯大林同志病重”的消息震撼了代表团每一个人的心。
    三月五日上午，我们在大雪纷飞中到达莫斯科。第二天天色微明中，我从旅馆窗口看到克里姆林宫降到半杆的苏联国旗，得到了这个最不幸的消息：伟大的斯大林已永远离开他所热爱的人类了。
    当天，我们代表团举行了追悼会。我们还参加了苏联科学院主席团的追悼会。涅斯米扬诺夫院长和许多位杰出的苏联科学家在会上发言，保证要化悲痛为力量，遵照伟大斯大林的遗志，使苏联的科学占居世界第一位；他们都以崇敬的心情，叙述了斯大林同志对科学的伟大贡献。他们是那样悲痛，但又是那样坚定！我深深地被感动了。
    在那些悲痛的日子里，全莫斯科、全苏联、全世界的亿万善良的人民都在同声哀悼这巨星的陨落。多少青年人，壮年人乃至老年人，在伟大斯大林的遗像前发出庄严的誓词，要加倍努力学习、工作，贡献出自己一切力量，更好地为共产主义事业而奋斗。
    殡葬的一天，马林科夫同志在殡礼中以沉痛坚决的声音号召全苏联的人民化悲痛为力量，继承斯大林同志的遗志，为建设共产主义的苏联而加倍努力。他特别指出了中苏两国牢不可破的友谊，以及和所有人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊，给予帝国主义侵略者以严重的警告。殡礼后，克里姆林宫的苏联国旗又升到旗杆顶上。它象征着苏联人民的无敌力量，苏联人民将沿着列宁斯大林党所开辟的胜利道路继续前进。
    接着，我们在苏联进行了为期约两个月的学习和访问。作为一个建筑师，我不能不注意到苏联的建筑在科学和艺术上的成就。我看到，苏联的大大小小城市是怎样遵照斯大林的指示，消灭了资本主义时代遗留下来的贫民窟，怎样在历史形成的城市基础上发展起来，怎样合理地布置了城市的工业、铁路交通，住宅、街道、广场、公园和一切文化、福利的建筑，并且和自然环境组织起来，成为一个有机的整体，成为整体的艺术造形。
    在斯大林同志亲自指导下拟定的“改建莫斯科市总计划”的决议是一九三五年六月由联共（布）中央和苏联人民委员会公布的。这一历史文件为全世界将来的城市建设指出了正确的方向，苏联数以千计的城市和村庄已经体现了斯大林同志这个伟大的思想。这种在生产上、在生活上、在物质上、在精神上无微不至地关怀着全体人民的整体城市，是斯大林同志对于人类城市建设史中无比崇高伟大的贡献。不但在莫斯科，从高插云霄的高楼和深入地底的车站，从新住宅一间小小的厨房到广阔的公园广场，处处都流露着斯大林同志对人民关怀的伟大思想，而且，在我们所见到的乌克兰共和国的首都基辅，和乌兹别克首都塔什干，以及在其他许多城市和乡村，这种斯大林式的对人民关怀的伟大思想，通过苏联共产党的民族政策，也同样有着辉煌的表现。
    在那些悲痛的日子里，我从苏联建筑所体现的斯大林思想受到的深刻教育，将永远留在记忆里。
    世界共产主义运动的伟大导师、伟大的斯大林逝世已经一周年了。今天，我怀着崇敬的心，悼念着这位不朽的巨人。我深信，斯大林的伟大的精神会永远同我们在一起的，全世界进步人类将为斯大林遗留下来的事业而不懈奋斗。斯大林永垂不朽！
