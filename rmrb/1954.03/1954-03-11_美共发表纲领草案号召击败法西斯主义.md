Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 8th: The American Communist Party has published a draft program entitled "The Road to Employment, Peace, and Democracy for America."

The draft program begins by stating that the United States and the American people are rapidly heading towards a crisis, and then speaks of "growing fear of an impending economic collapse." Comparing the profits of American companies with the figures of the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics, the draft program states that in 1953, American company profits amounted to $45 billion; while the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics admits that "more than half of American families are unable to purchase the minimum necessities for a decent and healthy life." The draft program emphasizes that the Eisenhower government is increasingly subordinating the government to monopoly capitalists, who are striving to intensify arms expansion and ultimately launch a war.

The draft program then discusses the crisis of American foreign policy. It says that American policy is attempting to "completely control the nations, markets, and resources of the world through the full range of bribery, rhetoric, intimidation, and ultimately war." The draft program states: "The current crisis of American foreign policy is due to the ruling class's refusal to recognize the new balance of world power. They are waging a cold war in an attempt to turn back the wheel of history, attempting to use the lie of Soviet aggression to prepare for a war to seize world hegemony."

The draft program then discusses the threat of McCarthyism and the deepening danger of fascism. It says that depriving the American people of their basic democratic freedoms "is not a post-war madness that will disappear on its own. It represents an ominous and terrible trend toward a full-fledged police state and fascism." Defeating American fascism is the American people's "current primary task."

The document then presents the Communist Party's five-point program of action.

First: "Increase the people's purchasing power and limit the power and profits of the trusts." The draft program calls for defeating all attempts to lower wages and advocates for the formulation of an anti-depression plan that includes measures to reduce prices, rents, and taxes.

Second: "Use money to benefit humanity, not for war; use it to build houses and schools, not to manufacture bombs and warships."

Third: "End the Cold War and promote friendship and trade." "Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and recognition of the autonomous rights of all countries."

Fourth: "Defend and strengthen democracy." The draft program calls for unity to fight for the pardon of all Smith Act victims, for the abolition of all congressional investigations, and for the repeal of all anti-labor legislation.

Fifth: "Fight for equal rights for Black people."

The draft program says that defeating the most reactionary candidates in the 1954 and 1956 elections requires the unity of all democratic forces. The draft program concludes by expressing its willingness "to work with all Americans, regardless of our past relationships or current differences, to prevent war and fascism."

    美共发表纲领草案号召击败法西斯主义
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社纽约八日讯：美国共产党发表了一个纲领草案，题为“美国走向就业、和平与民主的道路”。
    纲领草案一开头就说明，美国和美国人民在迅速走向危机，接着谈到“对迫近的经济崩溃日益增长的恐惧”。纲领草案把美国公司的利润与政府劳工统计局的数字作了一个对比说：一九五三年，美国的公司利润数达四百五十亿美元；而政府劳工统计局承认，“有一半以上的美国家庭无力购买适合一种过得去的健康生活的起码必需品”。纲领草案强调说，艾森豪威尔政府使得政府越来越从属于垄断资本家，这些垄断资本家力图加紧扩张军备并最后发动战争。
    纲领草案接着谈到美国外交政策的危机。它说，美国的政策是企图“通过行贿、花言巧语、威吓以及最后发动战争的全套办法”来完全控制世界上的国家、市场和资源。纲领草案说：“目前美国外交政策危机的发生是由于统治阶级拒绝承认世界力量新的对比。他们进行冷战是企图扭转历史的车轮，企图利用苏联侵略的谎话来准备攫取世界霸权的战争。”
    纲领草案接着谈到麦卡锡主义的威胁和日益加深的法西斯主义的危险。它说，剥夺美国人民的基本民主自由“并不是一种会自行消逝的战后疯狂举动。它代表着向十足的警察国家和法西斯主义发展的不祥的、可怕的趋向”。击败美国法西斯主义是美国人民“目前的首要任务”。
    文件接着提出了共产党的五点行动纲领。
    第一：“提高人民的购买力，限制托辣斯的势力和利润。”纲领草案号召击败一切压低工资的企图，并主张拟定一个包括减低物价、房租和赋税的措施的反萧条计划。
    第二：“把钱用来造福人类，不要用于战争；用来修建住宅和学校，不要用来制造炸弹和战舰。”
    第三：“结束冷战，促进友谊与贸易。”“不干涉他国内政，承认各国的自治权利。”
    第四：“保卫并加强民主。”纲领草案号召团结起来为赦免所有的史密斯法受害者、为废除所有的国会调查、为取消所有的反劳工立法而斗争。
    第五：“为黑人争取平等权利。”
    纲领草案说，要击败一九五四年和一九五六年选举中的最反动的候选人，就需要所有的民主力量团结起来。纲领草案最后表示愿意“与所有的美国人一起，不管我们过去的关系如何、目前的分歧如何，为防止战争和法西斯主义而努力”。
