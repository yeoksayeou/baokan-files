Xinhua News Agency, March 29th—Based on the Party's general line for the transition period and the current situation, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Central People's Government's State Council has formulated the main tasks for political and legal work in 1954, which has been approved by the State Council. The document stipulates that the general task of political and legal work in 1954 is to further improve the people's democratic system, strengthen and utilize the people's democratic legal system, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship to ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings.

    In terms of political power construction, the document first requires civil affairs departments at all levels to cooperate with and complete the general election work under the unified leadership of the election committees at all levels. Timely convene local people's congresses at all levels, fully promote democracy, advocate and support the people's supervision and criticism of state workers from the bottom up, and further improve the people's democratic system. At the same time, it is also necessary to systematically study and summarize the experience of urban and industrial-mining area political power construction serving production; strengthen county-level civil affairs work; continue to consolidate and improve township political power, and study and summarize the experience of township political power leading and ensuring the socialist transformation of agriculture. In ethnic minority areas, work with relevant departments to continue to promote ethnic regional autonomy and promote the development of their economic and cultural undertakings.

    Strengthening the prosecution and trial of cases related to economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings is a central link in this year's judicial work. The document requires procuratorates and courts or specialized courts in urban, industrial-mining areas, and along railways and waterways to focus on handling cases related to guaranteeing industrial and mining production, capital construction, railway transportation, and water transportation, as well as illegal cases of capitalist industry and commerce and labor-capital dispute cases; procuratorates and courts in special districts and counties should focus on handling cases related to protecting agricultural production and cooperatives, as well as cases violating the decrees on the planned purchase of grain. At the same time, through prosecution and trial work, timely and systematically study and summarize the issues and experiences related to ensuring economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings, to guide work and serve as a basis for legislation. In strengthening judicial construction, the provincial and municipal-level procuratorial and judicial departments should focus on establishing and improving procuratorates and courts in urban and industrial-mining areas, as well as specialized procuratorates and specialized courts (tribunals) along railways and waterways; courts below the special district level should focus on promoting and improving circuit courts, and gradually establish and improve mediation committees and the jury system. Implement the election system for judges in a planned and prepared manner. In provinces with better cadre conditions and a better work foundation, county-level procuratorial work should be established and improved as widely as possible.

    The document emphasizes the importance of strengthening legislative work during the national transition period, especially strengthening legislative work for economic construction. To this end, relevant political and legal departments will cooperate with other parties this year to begin drafting or studying important regulations on guaranteeing capital construction, punishing violations of labor protection and technical safety regulations, and protecting agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

    The document stipulates that the tasks of public security work this year are: on the basis of the basic end of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement and in the new situation of the enemy-us struggle, carry out various public security business construction, further fight the hidden enemy, strengthen economic security work, strengthen public security work of the police, educate the people to improve their vigilance, and deeply carry out the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries.

    In implementing the resolutions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference and carrying out various business constructions of civil affairs work, the document stipulates that the tasks of civil affairs departments this year, in addition to political power construction work, should focus on the following two tasks: (1) Effectively lead the people to do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary armymen, and disabled revolutionary soldiers, and the resettlement of demobilized and transferred soldiers, and earnestly mobilize and organize them to participate in various production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and various socialist construction undertakings as much as possible. (2) In disaster areas, continue to implement the policy of production for self-relief, thrift to overcome famine, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by necessary government relief, and focus on areas that have suffered disasters for many years to do a good job in rural disaster relief work. Urban relief work should also be carried out as necessary and possible.

    In order to effectively achieve the above tasks, the document stipulates that this year, a number of base-point units focusing on political and legal work in urban and industrial-mining areas should be established. The political and legal departments at all levels above the province and city should, under the leadership of the local party and government organs, cooperate with the departments of the relevant factories, mines, enterprises, or capital construction units to conduct key experiments on political and legal work, and study and summarize the experience of conducting political power construction in industrial-mining areas and establishing public security, procuratorial, and trial work in industrial-mining areas, along railways and waterways, to ensure the smooth progress of industrial and mining production, transportation, and capital construction. In cities with relatively developed capitalist industry and commerce, study and summarize the experience of political and legal work ensuring the country's implementation of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In towns with relatively developed handicraft industry, study and summarize the experience of political and legal work ensuring the socialist transformation of handicraft industry. At the same time, counties with a relatively solid foundation for agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation should also be selected to study and summarize the experience of political and legal work ensuring and promoting the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation.

    In order to adapt to the development of political and legal work, the document stipulates that it is also necessary to strengthen the publicity and cadre training and education work of political and legal work. In various political and legal business construction and cadre training work, political and legal cadres should focus on education on the Party's and the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period; draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie; strengthen cadres' learning of Marxism-Leninism theory, strengthen the study of policies and business, strengthen the study of advanced Soviet experience, and establish the view that political and legal work serves socialist economic construction. Publicize the importance of gradually improving and utilizing the legal system weapon during the period of the country's planned economic construction, and educate the people and cadres to abide by national laws; and should systematically expose the crimes of the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in undermining our country and economic construction, and improve the political vigilance of cadres and the people. Cadre training work should focus on the Party's and the state's general line during the transition period, and continue to adopt the policy of short-term rotational training of in-service cadres and pay close attention to the training of students in specialized colleges and universities. Systematically compile teaching materials and train teachers.

    Finally, the document particularly emphasizes that in order to ensure the realization of the country's general line and general tasks, all political and legal departments must strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class, strengthen the reporting and requesting instructions system to party and government leading organs; must strengthen collective leadership and political and ideological work among cadres; must implement the style of seeking truth from facts and the mass line. This is the decisive key to ensuring that all political and legal departments complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the state. All thoughts and styles contrary to this must be seriously inspected, criticism and self-criticism must be launched, and thoroughly overcome.

    政务院政治法律委员会现定今年政法工作任务
    【新华社二十九日讯】根据国家在过渡时期的总路线及当前情况，中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会制定了一九五四年政法工作的主要任务，已经政务院批准。这个文件规定一九五四年政法工作的总任务是：进一步健全人民民主制度，加强和运用人民民主法制，巩固人民民主专政，以保障国家的社会主义经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    在政权建设工作方面，文件首先要求各级民政部门应在各级选举委员会统一领导下，配合完成普选工作。及时召开地方各级人民代表大会，充分发扬民主，提倡和支持人民群众对国家工作人员的自下而上的监督和批评，进一步健全人民民主制度。同时并要系统地研究总结城市、工矿区政权建设工作为生产服务的经验；加强县的民政工作；继续整顿和改进乡政权，研究并总结乡政权领导和保障对农业的社会主义改造的经验。在少数民族地区，协同有关部门继续推行民族区域自治，促进其经济、文化事业的发展。
    加强有关经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业的案件的检察和审判工作，是今年司法工作的一个中心环节。文件要求城市、工矿区、铁路、水运沿线的检察署和法院或专门法庭，应抓紧处理有关保障工矿生产、基本建设、铁路运输、水上运输的案件和资本主义工商业的违法案件及劳资纠纷案件；专区和县的检察署、法院应抓紧处理有关保护农业生产和合作社的案件以及违反粮食计划收购法令的案件。同时，通过检察工作、审判工作，及时系统地研究总结有关保障经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业中的问题和经验，用以指导工作和作为立法的依据。在加强司法建设方面，省、市以上的检察和司法部门应以建立和健全城市、工矿区的检察署和法院以及铁路、水运沿线的专门检察署和专门法院　（庭）为重点；专区以下的法院，应以推广和健全巡回法庭为重点，并逐步建立和健全调解委员会及陪审制。有计划有准备地实行审判员选举制。在干部条件和工作基础较好的省，应尽可能普遍建立和健全县的检察工作。
    文件提出了在国家过渡时期加强立法工作，特别是加强经济建设的立法工作的重要性。为此，有关政法部门今年将配合其他方面着手起草或研究关于保障基本建设、制裁违反劳动保护和技术保安规程、保护农业生产互助合作组织等重要法规。
    文件规定今年公安工作的任务是：在镇压反革命运动基本结束的基础上和敌我斗争新的形势下，开展各项公安业务建设，进一步和隐蔽的敌人作斗争，加强经济保卫工作，加强民警治安工作，教育人民群众提高警惕，深入地开展镇压反革命的斗争。
    在贯彻第二次全国民政会议决议，开展民政工作的各项业务建设方面，文件规定今年民政部门的任务除了政权建设工作外，应抓紧以下两个工作：　（一）切实领导人民群众做好革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命残废军人的优抚工作和复员转业军人的安置工作，认真地发动和组织他们尽可能地参加各种生产互助合作组织和各种社会主义建设事业。（二）在灾区继续贯彻生产自救、节约渡荒、群众互助、辅以政府必要救济的方针，并以连年遭灾地区为重点，做好农村救灾工作。对城市救济工作也要按照必要和可能进行。
    为有效地实现上述任务，文件规定今年应建立以城市和工矿区政法工作为重心的若干基点单位。省、市以上各级政法部门应在当地党政机关的领导下，协同各该厂矿企业部门或基本建设单位进行关于政法工作的重点试验，研究总结在工矿区进行政权建设和在工矿区、铁路、水运沿线建立公安、检察和审判工作，以保障工矿生产、交通运输和基本建设顺利进行的经验。在资本主义工商业比较发达的城市，研究总结政法工作保障国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的经验。在手工业比较发达的市镇，研究总结政法工作保障对手工业实行社会主义改造的经验。同时，还应选择农业生产互助合作较有基础的县，研究总结政法工作保障和推动发展农业生产互助合作的经验。
    为适应政法工作的开展，文件规定还必须加强政法工作的宣传和干部训练教育工作。在各项政法业务建设和干部训练工作中，对政法干部着重进行党和国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务的教育；划清工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的界限；加强干部对马克思列宁主义理论的学习，加强对政策业务的学习，加强对苏联先进经验的学习，确立政法工作为社会主义经济建设服务的观点。宣传在国家有计划的经济建设时期逐步健全和运用法制武器的重要性，教育人民和干部遵守国家法律；并应有计划地揭露美蒋匪帮对我们国家和经济建设破坏活动的罪行，提高干部和人民的政治警惕性。干部训练工作，应以党和国家在过渡时期的总路线为中心内容，仍采用短期轮训在职干部为主并切实注意培养专科以上学校学生的方针。有计划地编译教材，培养师资。
    最后，文件特别强调指出：为了保证国家的总路线和总任务的实现，政法各部门必须加强工人阶级的思想领导，加强对党政领导机关的报告请示制度；必须加强集体领导和在干部中的政治思想工作；必须贯彻实事求是的群众路线的作风。这是保证政法各部门完成党和国家所给任务的决定关键。对一切与此相反的思想和作风，必须认真进行检查，展开批评和自我批评，彻底加以克服。
