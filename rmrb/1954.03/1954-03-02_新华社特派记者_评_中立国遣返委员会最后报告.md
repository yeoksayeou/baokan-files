Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st dispatch: This correspondent reports that the recently published "Final Report" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) once again points out to the world the fact that the US side used special agents to sabotage explanations and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war (POWs), thoroughly exposing the lie of so-called "voluntary repatriation" used by the US side to cover up its crime of forcibly detaining POWs.

The "Final Report" discusses the activities of the NNRC after submitting the "Interim Report" on December 28, 1953. As pointed out in the conclusion of the "Final Report," the conclusions and facts stated in the "Interim Report" regarding POWs being under the control of special agent organizations and not having the freedom to seek repatriation "were not only not damaged by anything described in the 'Final Report,' but were further evidenced."

The "Final Report" points out that the facts and circumstances of special agents obstructing the repatriation of POWs, as stated in the "Interim Report," "largely continued to exist and surrounded the Committee's efforts to fulfill its responsibilities regarding the implementation of its 'Terms of Reference'. Due to these facts and circumstances, only a small number of POWs exercised their right to be repatriated, and they did so secretly or at the risk of their lives." The "Final Report" also points out that when the POWs were handed over to the US side on January 20, US special agents tried their best to prevent the POWs from taking the opportunity to escape their control, so that "it was extremely difficult for anyone other than the most fearless and reckless POWs to approach the Indian guards to seek repatriation." The "Final Report" points out that the fear and influence spread by US special agents among the POWs "still existed until the very end." "It must be reiterated that the Committee and the Indian Custodial Forces experienced too much of the existence of this fear." The "Final Report" also quoted a letter from NNRC Chairman Thimayya to General Li Xiangchao on January 2, stating that "the POW organization still exists, and its coercive nature and harmful influence still exist." The "Final Report" also pointed out that US special agents, posing as POW "representatives," repeatedly "made it difficult for the Indian Custodial Forces even to perform ordinary administrative duties." They even demanded the "return" of those POWs who had escaped their control and requested repatriation.

According to the investigation of the murder cases in the East Camp POW camp, the "Final Report" points out that "all these murders occurred because the victims hoped to be repatriated or were suspected of having this desire." The "Final Report" once again confirmed that the 64th Field Hospital provided by the US side was a base for US special agent activities. The "Final Report" states that, according to the report submitted by the commander of the Indian Custodial Forces, "there is no doubt that the hospital is being used as a center to organize POWs, transmit information, and communicate with people outside the demilitarized zone, and that some of the hospital staff are involved."

Based on all these facts and circumstances, the "Final Report" concludes that "the South Camp POW organizations and the leaders who presided over these organizations negated all assumptions or delusions about freedom of choice." "The Committee must frankly state its belief based on its own experience that it is a delusion unsupported by any evidence to believe that these POWs have voluntarily chosen not to be repatriated without more fully and further implementing the 'Terms of Reference'." In this way, the NNRC thoroughly proved that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" manufactured by the US side was a forced detention of POWs, completely shattering the US side's ghost talk about POWs "preferring suicide to repatriation," and exposing to the world the ugly crime of the US side's forced detention of POWs.

Since the NNRC, based on its own experience, recognized the fact that the US side used special agents to obstruct the repatriation of POWs, it should obviously take appropriate and necessary measures to fairly fulfill the basic responsibility entrusted to it by the Korean Armistice Agreement of "guaranteeing all POWs... the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated." However, the "Final Report," like the "Interim Report," shows that the NNRC did not meet the just wishes of peace-loving people all over the world. Instead of trying to safeguard the "Terms of Reference" and the POWs' right to be repatriated, it facilitated the US side's evil act of forcibly detaining POWs.

The basic goal of the "Terms of Reference" is to guarantee that all POWs can freely exercise their right to be repatriated. For this purpose, the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that POWs must first be freed from the control and influence of the original detaining side, and then the POWs' home country will conduct a ninety-day explanation to eliminate their doubts and fears. However, after determining the fact that the US side used special agents to continue to control the POWs, the NNRC still refused to take necessary measures against the special agents, so that the explanations by the Korean and Chinese sides were severely obstructed by the special agents directed by the US side, and only ten days were conducted during the ninety days. When the US side unilaterally announced the termination of the explanations on December 23, 1953, the NNRC abandoned its legal authority and succumbed to the demands of the US side.

The "Final Report" shows that on the issue of terminating the explanations and on the issue of the treatment of POWs, the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners insisted on the principles established by the "Terms of Reference." Starting from the basic goal of the "Terms of Reference," the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners firmly advocated that "the explanations must be continued to make up the full term" and opposed handing the POWs back to the US side, so that they would continue to suffer the enslavement of the US side. They correctly pointed out that "only by continuing the explanations can this Committee realize Article 8, the key to the 'Terms of Reference'." The Swiss and Swedish commissioners, however, abandoned the basic goal of the "Terms of Reference" and tried their best to legitimize the unreasonable proposition of the US side's unilateral termination of the explanations. The Swedish commissioner, with the support of the Swiss commissioner, even suggested that the committee "should declare on January 22, 1954, that the POWs who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be stripped of their POW status and become civilians," openly attempting to make the NNRC a tool for the US side to forcibly detain POWs. This absurd proposal was rejected by the committee.

The "Final Report" also shows that the Swiss and Swedish commissioners provided various cover-ups for the US side's crime of using special agents to obstruct the repatriation of POWs. Although they had to admit that there were special agent organizations in the East Camp POW camp and that special agents obstructed those who wanted to be repatriated, they tried to prove that the POWs still had the opportunity to apply for repatriation. The reason they gave was that more than 500 POWs had been repatriated during the NNRC's custody, and more than 100 POWs had requested repatriation when the POWs were handed back to the US side. However, the circumstances of these POWs risking their lives to apply for repatriation, as pointed out in the "Interim Report" and the "Final Report," completely refuted this clumsy defense. What is especially shameful is that the Swiss commissioner also tried to allow the special agent murderers who murdered the POWs to go unpunished. He actually believed that these murderers should be handed over to the US side after January 22. This completely exposed the hypocrisy of the so-called "humanitarianism" in the mouth of the Swiss commissioner.

The "Final Report" also shows that the Indian commissioner, as the arbitrator of the NNRC, failed to firmly support the reasonable propositions of the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners, but adopted a contradictory and erroneous attitude. The "Final Report" repeatedly stated that the contracting parties had granted the committee "the sole right to interpret the 'Terms of Reference'." However, on the issue of terminating the explanations, although the majority of the commissioners, including the Indian commissioner, believed that the explanation period should be extended, the Indian chairman refused to exercise legal authority and make a decision to extend the explanation period based on a majority vote in accordance with Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference." The Indian commissioner erroneously argued that "the extension can only be implemented after an agreement between the United Nations Command and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers." This erroneous argument led to a series of erroneous actions, until the unilateral transfer of POWs to the US side and the illegal dissolution of the NNRC, which facilitated the realization of the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain POWs.

In the process of discussing various facts, the "Final Report" exposed to the world the extreme arrogance and unreasonableness and perfidy of the US side. After using special agents to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides, the US side unilaterally terminated the explanations and pressured the NNRC to "release" the POWs to it. After the NNRC returned the POWs to it, it disregarded the NNRC's repeated warnings and immediately sent the POWs to Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang bandits to serve as cannon fodder, and brazenly announced the change of POW status from 00:01 on January 23. In order to allow the special agent murderers to escape justice, the US side used various means to make the trial of the murderers by the Indian military court a farce that ended without resolution, and finally took over all these murderers and immediately sent them to the Syngman Rhee Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The "Final Report" pointed out in its conclusion that "the legal prerequisites necessary for stripping POWs of their status and making them civilians do not exist, and therefore this 'stripping' is illegal."

The "Interim Report" and "Final Report" of the NNRC clearly told the world that the committee failed to complete the important task entrusted to it by peace-loving people all over the world, and the US side should bear all the responsibility for this.

### 新华社特派记者  评“中立国遣返委员会最后报告”

    评“中立国遣返委员会最后报告”
     【新华社开城一日电】本社特派记者报道：中立国遣返委员会最近发表的“最后报告”，再次向全世界指出了美方利用特务破坏解释、阻止战俘遣返的事实，彻底揭穿了美方用来掩饰其强迫扣留战俘的罪行的所谓“自愿遣返”的谎言。
    “最后报告”论述了中立国遣返委员会在一九五三年十二月二十八日提出“临时报告”以后的活动。正如“最后报告”的结论中所指出的，“临时报告”中所申述的关于战俘处于特务组织控制之下、没有寻求遣返的自由的结论和事实，“不仅未为‘最后报告’所叙述的任何事物所损害，反而得到了更多的证据”。
    “最后报告”指出，在“临时报告”中陈述过的特务阻挠战俘遣返的事实与情况，“大部分曾继续存在，并且包围着本委员会对履行其有关实施‘职权范围’的责任的努力。由于这些事实与情况，仅有一小部分战俘行使了被遣返的权利，而且他们是偷偷摸摸或冒着生命危险这样做的”。“最后报告”还指出，在一月二十日战俘被移交给美方时，美方特务曾经竭力设法不让战俘乘机逃脱他们的控制，以致“除了最无畏与不顾死活的战俘以外，任何人都极难接近印度守卫以寻求遣返”。“最后报告”指出，美方特务在战俘中散布的恐惧和影响“直到最后还是存在着的”。“必须重新申说的是，本委员会与印度看管部队对这种恐惧的存在是经验得太多了”。“最后报告”中所摘引的中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅在一月二日给李相朝中将的信中也说，“战俘组织依然存在，其胁迫的性质与有害的影响也依然存在”。“最后报告”并且指出，冒充战俘“代表”的美方特务一再“使印度看管部队连在执行普通的行政职司时也遭到困难”。他们甚至要求“归还”那些逃脱他们控制而要求遣返的战俘。
    “最后报告”根据对东场里战俘营中发生的谋杀案的调查，指出“所有这些谋杀案之所以发生，是因为那些被害者希望遣返或被怀疑抱有此种愿望”。“最后报告”再次证实了美方所提供的第六十四野战医院是美方特务活动的大本营。最后报告说，根据印度看管部队司令官提出的报告，“毫无疑问该医院正被利用作为一个中心来组织战俘、传递信息、并与非军事区以外的人通讯，而且该医院的某些工作人员是牵涉在内的”。
    根据所有这些事实与情况，“最后报告”得出结论说，“南营战俘组织及主持这些组织的首领否定了关于自由选择的一切假设或妄言”。“本委员会必须坦白陈述其以自己的经验为基础的信念，即若不更充分与进一步地执行‘职权范围’而认为这些战俘已自愿选择了不遣返的说法，都是毫无任何证据作支持的妄言”。这样，中立国遣返委员会就彻底证明，美方制造的所谓“自愿遣返”就是强迫扣留战俘，彻底粉碎了美方的所谓战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”的鬼话，向全世界揭露了美方强迫扣留战俘的丑恶罪行。
    中立国遣返委员会既然根据它自身的经验，认清了美方利用特务阻挠战俘遣返的事实，显然就应该采取适当的必要的措施，以公正地履行朝鲜停战协定所赋予它的“保证全部战俘……有机会行使其被遣返的权利”的基本职责。但是“最后报告”和“临时报告”一样表明，中立国遣返委员会没有满足全世界爱好和平的人民的正义愿望，它不但没有设法维护“职权范围”和战俘的被遣返的权利，反而使美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶行为得到了便利。
   “职权范围”的基本目标是保证全部战俘能够自由行使其被遣返的权利。为此目的，“职权范围”规定必须首先使战俘摆脱原拘留一方的控制与影响，然后由战俘所属国家对战俘进行九十天的解释，以消除他们的疑惧心理。可是中立国遣返委员会在确定了美方利用特务继续控制战俘的事实以后，却仍然拒绝对特务分子采取必要的措施，以致朝中方面的解释工作受到美方所指挥的特务的重重阻挠，在九十天之中只进行了十天。而当美方在一九五三年十二月二十三日片面宣布终止解释的时候，中立国遣返委员会竟又放弃了自己的合法职权，屈从了美方的要求。
    “最后报告”表明：在终止解释的问题上，在对战俘的处理问题上，波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员坚持了“职权范围”所确定的原则。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员从“职权范围”的基本目标出发，坚决主张“解释必须予以继续以补满十足的期限”，反对将战俘交还给美方，使他们继续遭受美方的奴役。他们正确地指出，“只有继续解释，本委员会才能实现‘职权范围’关键所系的第八款。”而瑞士和瑞典委员却抛开“职权范围”的基本目标不谈而竭力企图使美方的片面终止解释的无理主张合法化。瑞典委员并且在瑞士委员支持之下建议委员会“应于一九五四年一月二十二日宣布解除尚未行使遣返权利之战俘的战俘身分使之成为平民”，公然企图使中立国遣返委员会成为美方强迫扣留战俘的工具。这个荒谬的提案遭到了委员会的否决。
   “最后报告”还表明，瑞士和瑞典委员给美方利用特务阻挠战俘遣返的罪行多方进行掩饰。他们虽然不得不承认在东场里战俘营中有特务组织存在，特务分子阻挠那些愿意遣返的人，可是他们却企图证明战俘还是有申请遣返的机会的，他们所举出来的理由就是在中立国遣返委员会看管期间有五百多名战俘已获遣返，而在战俘被交还给美方时也有一百多名战俘要求遣返。但是“临时报告”和“最后报告”所指出的这些战俘冒死申请遣返的情形，完全驳斥了这种拙劣的辩护。尤其可耻的是，瑞士委员还企图使谋杀战俘的特务凶手逍遥法外，他竟然认为这些凶手应该在一月二十二日以后就送交给美方。这就彻底暴露了瑞士委员嘴里的所谓“人道主义”的虚伪性。
    “最后报告”也表明，作为中立国遣返委员会的公断人的印度委员没有能够坚决支持波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的合理主张，却采取了自相矛盾的错误态度。“最后报告”一再申明：缔约双方赋予委员会以“唯一的解释‘职权范围’的权利”。但是，终止解释的问题上，虽然包括印度委员在内的多数委员都认为解释期限应予延长，印度主席却拒绝按照“职权范围”第二十四款的规定，在多数表决的基础上执行合法的职权，作出延长解释期限的决定。印度委员错误地主张，“只有经过联合国军及朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军双方之间的协议，延长方能实行”。这种错误的主张导致了一系列的错误行动，直到将战俘片面移交给美方和中立国遣返委员会的非法解散，这就使美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋的实现获得了便利。
    “最后报告”在论述各项事实的过程中向全世界揭露了美方的极端蛮横无理和背信弃义的行为。在利用特务破坏朝中方面的解释工作以后，美方就片面终止解释，压迫中立国遣返委员会将战俘“释放”给它。而在中立国遣返委员会将战俘送还给它以后，它又不顾中立国遣返委员会的一再警告，将战俘立刻送给李承晚和国民党匪帮充当炮灰，并且悍然宣布从一月二十三日零时一分起改变战俘身分。为了使特务凶手得以逃避正义的制裁，美方用种种手段使印度军事法庭对凶手的审讯成为一场不了了之的滑稽戏，并且最后又将这些凶手接收过去立即全部送交李承晚蒋介石匪帮。“最后报告”在其结论中指出，“解除战俘身分使之成为平民所必需的法律上的先决条件并不存在，因而这种‘解除’是不合法的。”
    中立国遣返委员会的“临时报告”和“最后报告”明确地告诉了全世界，委员会没有能够完成全世界爱好和平的人民所付托给它的重大任务，而美方对此应该担负全部的责任。
