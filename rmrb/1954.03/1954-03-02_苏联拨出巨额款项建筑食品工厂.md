Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: According to TASS news: The Soviet Union will allocate 8.5 billion rubles this year to build new food factories, which is twice the investment of last year. In addition to hundreds of small and medium-sized food industrial enterprises, 450 new large-scale food factories are being built. The Soviet Union will produce 2.18 million tons of meat, 710,000 tons of sausages, 2.715 million tons of fish and seafood, 520 million cans of meat and fish, 476,000 tons of animal oil, 97,000 tons of cheese, and 4.3 million tons of sugar this year.

　　A large number of new food factories with large production capacity will be put into operation in the Soviet Union this year. In the main livestock breeding areas of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova, many newly built meat product factories can process 1,200 tons of meat, more than 250 tons of sausages, and hundreds of thousands of cans per work shift after they are put into operation this year. The meat alone can supply 120,000 people for one year. A large-scale meat product factory in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, can process 115 tons of meat and 140,000 cans of meat per day after it is put into operation this year. Several newly built meat product factories in Guriyev, Stone Estuary, and Balkhash can double the output of meat products in Kazakhstan compared to 1950. Eight newly built canned milk factories in the important industrial centers of Donbass, Siberia, and the Urals will be put into operation this year. On average, each factory can produce 50 million cans of condensed milk and 4 million kilograms of milk powder per year. This year, the Soviet Union will also have six large sugar refineries with new machinery and equipment put into operation, which can process 1 million tons of sugar beets during the sugar refining season this year.

　　This year, Soviet food industrial enterprises will use mechanized and automated equipment more extensively. This year, the Soviet Ministry of Machine Building Industry will produce machinery and equipment worth 530 million rubles for the food industry, including more than 100 kinds of new machines. An automated condensed milk canning factory recently designed in the Soviet Union implements mechanization and automation throughout the entire production process from receiving pure milk to boxing cans. Many new machines specially designed and manufactured for the food industry have high production efficiency and can reduce the hard labor of workers. One of them is a special machine for loading sugar beets and potatoes with a tractor. It can load 220 tons of sugar beets or potatoes onto vehicles per hour, which can eliminate the hard labor of tens of thousands of people. The staff of the Soviet Refrigeration Industry Scientific Research Institute designed a rapid freezer for freezing meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables, which freezes several times faster than ordinary freezers. If this machine is installed in the hold, it can freeze freshly caught fish in one or two hours, and ten tons of fish can be frozen in one day and night. Soviet engineer Meleshin designed a new machine for making butter, which not only reduces the time for making butter from five hours to two or thirty minutes, but also improves the quality of butter. This year, the Soviet Union will use this machine to renovate existing cream factories.

    苏联拨出巨额款项建筑食品工厂
   【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联今年将拨款八十五亿卢布建筑新的食品工厂，这数字为去年投资的两倍。除了几百个中小型食品工业企业，四百五十个新的大型食品工厂正在建筑起来。苏联今年将生产肉类二百一十八万吨，腊肠类七十一万吨，鱼类和海味二百七十一万五千吨，肉类和鱼类罐头五亿二千万听，动物油四十七万六千吨，乳酪九万七千吨，砂糖四百三十万吨。
    苏联今年将有大批新的、生产能力很大的食品工厂投入生产。在俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、哈萨克、吉尔吉斯和摩尔达维亚等共和国的主要牲畜饲养地区，许多新建的肉类制品工厂今年投入生产后，在每个工作班的时间内可以加工制出一千二百吨肉、二百五十吨以上的腊肠和几十万听罐头，其中单是肉类一种就可以供给十二万人吃一年。哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图今年投入生产的一个大型肉类制品工厂，每天可以加工制出一百一十五吨肉类和十四万听肉类罐头。古里耶夫、石山口和巴尔喀什城的若干新建的肉类制品工厂，可以使哈萨克共和国的肉类制品产量增为一九五○年的两倍。在重要工业中心顿巴斯、西伯利亚和乌拉尔新建的八个罐头牛乳工厂，将在今年投入生产，平均每个工厂每年可以生产五千万听炼乳和四百万公斤的奶粉。今年苏联还将有六个具有新式机器设备的大炼糖厂投入生产，在今年炼糖季节中，它们可以加工一百万吨甜菜。
    苏联食品工业企业今年将更广泛地使用机械化和自动化设备。今年苏联机器制造工业部将为食品工业生产价值达五亿三千万卢布的机器设备，其中包括一百种以上的新式机器。苏联最近设计的一座自动化炼乳罐头工厂，从接受净牛乳起到罐头装箱为止整个生产过程都实行机械化和自动化。许多专为食品工业设计和制造的新式机器，都具有很高的生产效率，并可以减轻工人的费力劳动。其中有一种用拖拉机曳引的专门装载甜菜和马铃薯用的机器。它每小时能把二百二十吨甜菜或马铃薯装到车上，可以免除几万人的费力劳动。苏联冷藏工业科学研究所的工作人员为冷冻肉类、鱼类、水果、蔬菜设计了一种快速冷冻器，它的冷冻速度要比普通的冷冻器快好几倍。这种机器如装在船舱中，可在一两小时之内冷冻刚刚捕获的鱼，一昼夜可冷冻十吨鱼。苏联工程师麦列辛为制造奶油设计的一种新机器，不但可以把制奶油的时间从五小时减到二、三十分钟，而且还可以改进牛油的质量。今年，苏联将用这种机器来改装现有的奶油工厂。
