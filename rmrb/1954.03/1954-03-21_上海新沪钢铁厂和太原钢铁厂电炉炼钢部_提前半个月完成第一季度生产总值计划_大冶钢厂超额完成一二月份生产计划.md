    Shanghai Xin Hu Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department
    Complete First Quarter Production Value Plan Half a Month Ahead of Schedule
    Daye Steel Plant Exceeds Production Plan for January and February
    The Shanghai State-owned Xin Hu Iron and Steel Plant completed its first quarter production value plan on March 14th, ahead of schedule. The output plan for most products in the first quarter will also be realized ahead of schedule. In the past two months, the quality of products produced by the plant has been very good, exceeding planned targets. Although the actual working days in the first quarter of this year were less than in the fourth quarter of last year, the value created by the plant's employees was much higher than in the fourth quarter of last year. It is estimated that by March 24th, the value produced by the plant will be equivalent to the actual total production value of the fourth quarter of last year. By the end of March, it is expected to exceed the actual total production value of the fourth quarter of last year by 13 percent. The average hourly steel production of the plant in January and February increased by 36 percent compared to the fourth quarter of last year.
    In order to complete and exceed the first quarter production plan, Xin Hu Iron and Steel Plant made several improvements to existing production equipment and operating methods based on the recommendations of Soviet experts. For example, a waist furnace was added to the steel baking furnace, which increased the steel baking capacity by 27 percent compared to the original, solving the problem that the steel baking capacity of the steel baking furnace could not keep up with the needs of the rolling mill. The plant's serious preparation work in the fourth quarter of last year also ensured the early realization of the first quarter production plan.
    Currently, the plant is actively carrying out production preparation work for the second quarter. The supply and marketing department is signing custom contracts for various products for the second quarter with several basic construction and industrial and mining units. According to needs, the cold casting workshop, which originally produced train wheels, will dedicate one and a half months in the second quarter to producing steel ingot molds. The plant is preparing the equipment and tools for producing steel ingot molds, formulating operating methods and changing labor organization plans, and preparing to start experimental production at the end of March. The Ma Tie workshop has begun producing some semi-finished products for April production. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Furthermore: The electric furnace steelmaking department of the state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the first quarter production plan by 1.86 percent on March 15th, ahead of schedule. The quality of the steel fully met the standards stipulated by the state. In the seventy-four days from New Year's Day to March 15th this year, the steel they produced increased by 0.12 percent compared to the actual output in the fourth quarter of last year. It is estimated that by the end of the month, it will exceed the first quarter plan by about 20 percent.
    Since New Year's Day this year, the employees of the electric furnace steelmaking department of the plant have continuously created four new daily production records and twenty new smelting records. In the past two and a half months, they have put forward seventy-eight rationalization proposals and actively implemented the Soviet experts' suggestion on extending the life of the furnace wall. The eight tips for improving the melting of molten steel put forward by the workers were collected and formulated into a comprehensive operating method. After this operating method was promoted in the workshop, it played a significant role in increasing output.
    The employees who successfully completed the first quarter production plan have now put forward the slogan of guaranteeing the overfulfillment of the second quarter and annual national plans, and are actively formulating specific measures to improve production technology management, striving to produce more high-quality steel for the country.

    Furthermore: The employees of Daye Steel Plant, educated by the general line, are vigorously and conscientiously implementing planned management and advanced Soviet experience, and have continuously overfulfilled the national production plans for January and February. In total: pig iron was completed by 103.5 percent, steel by 103.6 percent, and steel products by 102.7 percent. Recently, they also created a new national record of 110 heats of steel per day in the Bessemer converter, and the quality of steel increased to 99 percent.
    The education of the general line has made everyone feel their significant responsibility in realizing the general line. During and after the Spring Festival, the vast majority of workshops maintained an attendance rate of 98 percent. The workers in the Bessemer converter section actively looked for tips and tapped potential, increased the number of uses of tuyere bricks and furnace nozzles, and strengthened labor organization work and the implementation of technical measures plans, shortening the smelting time per heat by four minutes. On March 4th, they created a new national record, creating preliminary conditions for completing one and a half year's plan in one year. The workers in the open-hearth furnace workshop improved the furnace protection work, ensuring that the furnace bottom did not pit for more than ten days, extending the life of the furnace, and shortening the furnace repair time, allowing the open-hearth furnace to complete the national plan for two consecutive months and creating a new record of 290 heats being refined after one medium repair since the furnace was opened. The workers of the 17th section of the rolling mill workshop did not rest on Sundays and have rushed to produce large steel products of 41 meters in length for the Han River Railway Bridge project. The production of electric furnaces has gradually moved towards balanced production from the situation of relying on rush work to complete the plan in the fourth quarter of last year.
    Last year, the iron-smelting workshop failed to complete the plan for three consecutive months when smelting sand-cast pig iron. This year, in January and February, they learned the advanced Soviet experience of "edge distribution method" and overfulfilled the production plans for two months.
    Now, the leadership of the plant has pointed out the shortcomings in production during this period—the imbalance between the production of steel ingots and steel products, and the fact that individual workshops have only completed the national plan but not the plant's work plan—warning everyone, and at the same time starting to establish a responsibility system and formulate a technical measures plan to further consolidate planned management.

### 上海新沪钢铁厂和太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部  提前半个月完成第一季度生产总值计划  大冶钢厂超额完成一二月份生产计划

    上海新沪钢铁厂和太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部
    提前半个月完成第一季度生产总值计划
    大冶钢厂超额完成一二月份生产计划
    上海国营新沪钢铁厂已在三月十四日提前完成了第一季度生产总值计划。第一季度大部分产品的产量计划也将提前实现。两个多月来，该厂出产的产品质量很好，都超过了计划指标。虽然今年第一季度的实际工作日比去年第四季度少，但该厂职工创造的价值，却比去年第四季度提高了很多。预计到三月二十四日，该厂生产的价值就可以相当于去年第四季度的实际生产总值。到三月底，预计可以超过去年第四季度实际生产总值百分之十三。该厂一、二两月每小时生产的钢材，平均比去年第四季度提高了百分之三十六。
    为了完成和超额完成第一季度生产计划，新沪钢铁厂曾根据苏联专家建议，把现有生产设备和操作方法作了若干改进。如在烘钢炉里增加了腰炉，使烘钢能力比原来提高了百分之二十七，解决了烘钢炉的烘钢能力赶不上轧钢机需要的问题。该厂在去年第四季度认真进行了生产准备工作，也保证了第一季生产计划的提前实现。
    现在，该厂正在积极进行第二季度的生产准备工作。供销部门正在与若干基本建设和工矿单位签订第二季度各种产品的定制合同。根据需要，本来是生产火车轮的冷铸车间，第二季将抽出一个半月的时间生产钢锭模子。该厂正在准备生产钢锭模子的设备和工具，拟订操作方法和改变劳动组织的方案，并准备在三月底开始进行试验性生产。马铁车间已开始为四月份生产一部分在制品。（新华社）
    又讯：国营太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部在三月十五日超额百分之一点八六提前完成第一季度生产计划。钢的质量完全达到国家规定的标准。从今年元旦到三月十五日的七十四天中，他们生产的钢比去年第四季度的实际产量增加了百分之零点一二，到月底预计将超过第一季度计划百分之二十左右。
    该厂电炉炼钢部职工从今年元旦起，曾连续创造了四次日产最高新纪录和二十次冶炼新纪录。他们曾在两个半月的时间内，提出了七十八件合理化建议，并积极执行了苏联专家关于延长炉墙寿命的建议。职工们提出的改进钢水溶化情况的八大窍门，被集中起来制定成了综合操作法。这个操作法在车间推广以后，对提高产量起了很大作用。
    出色地完成了第一季生产计划的职工们，现在又提出了保证超额完成第二季度和全年国家计划的口号，积极制定各项改进生产技术管理的具体办法争取为国家生产更多的优质钢。　　　（新华社）
    又讯：受到总路线教育的大冶钢厂职工，都朝气蓬勃地认真贯彻计划管理与苏联先进经验，连续超额完成一、二月份的国家生产计划。总计：生铁完成百分之一○三点五，钢百分之一○三点六，钢材一○二点七。最近还创造了贝氏炉日产一百一十炉钢的全国新纪录，钢的质量提高到百分之九十九。
    总路线的教育使大家感到自己在实现总路线中的重大责任。春节前后绝大多数的车间都保持了百分之九十八的出勤率。贝氏炉工段职工积极找窍门、挖潜力，增加了风眼砖与炉嘴的使用次数，同时加强劳动组织工作与贯彻技术措施计划，使每炉吹炼时间缩短四分钟，在三月四日创造了全国新纪录，为一年完成一年半的计划初步创造了条件。平炉车间的职工改进护炉工作，使炉底作到十多天不出坑，延长了炉子寿命，并缩短修炉时间，使平炉连续两个月都完成了国家计划，并创造了开炉以来中修一次炼二百九十炉的新纪录。轧钢车间十七号工段的工人星期日不休息，已为汉水铁桥工程赶制出长达四十一公尺的大型钢材。电炉的生产已由去年第四季靠突击完成计划的情况逐步走上均衡生产。
    炼铁车间去年炼翻砂生铁时，连续三个月没有完成计划，今年一、二月学习了苏联先进经验“边缘布料法”，便超额完成了两个月的生产计划。
    现在，该厂领导上已提出这个时期生产上的缺点——钢锭与钢材之间的生产不均衡，个别车间只完成了国家计划而没有完成本厂作业计划，警惕大家，同时开始建立责任制，并订出技术措施计划，进一步巩固计划管理。　　　　　（曹葆铭）
