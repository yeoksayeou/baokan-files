    Jinping Phosphate Mine Completes First Quarter Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The Jinping Phosphate Mine in the city of Xin Hailian, Jiangsu Province, completed its first quarter production plan fourteen days ahead of schedule. As of the 17th of this month, the output had met the quarterly plan, and the quality plan had been completed by 102.25 percent.
    Phosphate rock powder is a valuable natural fertilizer. The phosphate rock powder produced by the Jinping Phosphate Mine is supplied to Guangdong and Hainan Island for cultivating sugarcane used in sugar production, and is also exported to foreign countries in exchange for industrial equipment needed for national construction.
    At the beginning of this year, the mine's leadership carefully inspected and summarized the production of the fourth quarter of last year, drawing lessons from it, and decided to strengthen planned management and implement safe production. After preparing the first quarter plan for this year, they earnestly mobilized all mine workers to start discussions. On the one hand, the plan was revised based on mass opinions, and on the other hand, the plan concept of the workers was further strengthened through discussions, thereby drawing up the operation plans for workshops and groups, and individual plans. In the process of implementing the plan, the leadership also paid close attention to organizing the masses to inspect and revise the plan, and established the system of brainstorming sessions and closing meetings in the workshops and groups as a regular method for inspecting the work plans of the groups.
    At the same time, in the first quarter of production, the mine's leadership placed the implementation of safe operations in a position of paramount importance. They not only educated the workers to include guaranteeing safe production in the plan as a regular part of the daily brainstorming sessions and closing meetings, and specially explained safety-related knowledge to the masses in the form of lectures, but also assigned four cadres who taught safety courses to various production workshops to conduct education on safety regulations and safety knowledge at any time. Therefore, in the past two and a half months, in addition to one worker who had his finger injured due to carelessness, no other accidents occurred, which strongly guaranteed the normal progress of production and the early completion of the production plan.

    锦屏磷矿提前完成第一季度生产计划
    江苏省新海连市锦屏磷矿提前十四天完成了第一季度生产计划。到本月十七日止，产量完成了季度计划，质量计划完成百分之一百零二点二五。
    磷灰粉是一种宝贵的天然肥料。锦屏磷矿所生产的磷灰粉，除供应广东、海南岛一带培植制糖用的甘蔗外，还输送到国外换回国家建设需用的工业设备。
    今年年初，该矿领导方面就认真检查和总结了去年第四季度的生产，从中吸取经验教训，确定加强计划管理和贯彻安全生产。在编好今年第一季度计划以后，又认真发动全矿职工展开讨论。一方面根据群众意见修正计划，一方面又通过讨论进一步加强了职工群众的计划观念，从而订出了车间、小组的作业计划和个人的计划。在执行计划的过程中，领导方面又抓紧组织群众检查和修订计划，并在车间小组内建立了碰头会和收工会的制度，作为检查小组作业计划的经常的方法。
    同时，在第一季度生产中，该矿领导方面把贯彻安全作业提到了头等重要的地位。不仅教育职工把保证安全生产列入计划，作为每天碰头会、收工会经常检查的内容，并以上课方式专门向群众讲解有关安全的知识，还把四个上安全课的干部分配到各个生产车间，随时随地进行安全制度和安全常识的教育。因此两个半月来除了一个工人因麻痹大意手指被压伤外，再没有发生过任何事故，这样，就有力地保证了生产的正常进行和生产计划的提前完成。
