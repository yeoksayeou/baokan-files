Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory Actively Prepares for Construction

    Preparations for the construction of the state-owned Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, a factory manufacturing precision electric meters and instruments in our country, are actively underway.

    The factory is one of the 141 key projects aided by the Soviet Union for construction and renovation in our country. This factory is large in scale and precise in structure. The construction task will be completed from 1954 to 1956, and it will be officially put into production in the second half of 1956. As early as April 1953, the factory began preparations such as site selection, geological exploration, and collection of design data. Currently, these tasks have been completed, and the product plan and factory area planning have also been determined. Most of the detailed drawings have also arrived at the construction site. This year, construction will begin on two factory buildings, a boiler room, a steam supply system, as well as water and sewage systems, electricity, compressed air lines, and dormitories. The basic construction plan, equipment, and materials plan for this year have been drafted. The technical design of the construction organization design has been submitted and is now entering the final stage of detailed construction drawings and unit project budget. The temporary projects required for construction, such as water sources, electricity, and transportation facilities, are also well prepared. Various materials allocated by the state are being continuously transported to the construction site. While preparing for construction, the factory has begun to systematically cultivate the technical personnel needed for future production, and has established a technical worker school with more than 200 students participating in the study.

    哈尔滨电表仪器厂积极进行施工准备工作
    我国制造精密电表仪器的工厂——国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂建厂施工前的各项准备工作正在积极进行。
    该厂是苏联帮助我国新建和改建一百四十一项重点工程之一，这座工厂规模宏大，结构精密，将在一九五四年至一九五六年完成建厂任务，并在一九五六年下半年正式投入生产。该厂早在一九五三年四月就着手进行厂址选择、地质钻探和搜集设计资料等准备工作，目前这些工作均已作好，产品方案和厂区规划问题也已确定，详图也已大部到达工地。今年将有两个厂房、锅炉房和蒸汽供应系统以及上下水道、电力、空气压缩线路、宿舍等项工程开始施工。今年的基本建设计划、设备和材料等计划均已拟好，施工组织设计的技术设计已提出，正进入最后的施工详图和单位工程预算阶段。施工所需的临时工程——水源、电力、交通等设施也已准备妥善。国家调拨的各项材料正陆续运到工地。该厂在准备工作的同时，开始了有计划的培养将来生产时所需要的技术人材，开办了技术工人学校，有二百多学员参加了学习。　（仲秀梅）
