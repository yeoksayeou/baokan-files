Henan Province Combines Spring Ploughing Production to Develop Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations

    Henan Province's mutual aid and cooperation movement is vigorously developing in close combination with spring ploughing production. By mid-February, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province had increased from the original 852 to 2,130, and 620 old cooperatives had also expanded, with the number of participating households increasing by 54 percent. At present, the organized farmers have reached 54 percent of the total number of farm households in the province, an increase of 12 percent compared with the winter of 1953.

    Under the slogans of "Building cooperatives while producing," "Do a good job in production and strive to join the cooperatives," and "Formulating a production plan while formulating a cooperative building plan," cadres in various parts of Henan actively lead the work of building cooperatives. When He Zhuang Township in Huojia County established the "Red Flag Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" on the basis of the Ma Yingxuan Cooperative, the village branch and cooperative cadres, while solving the specific problems of members joining the cooperative, led everyone to discuss and arrange spring production and launched the work of hoeing wheat to preserve moisture. The evaluation team, composed of the secretary of the township branch and the cadres of the cooperative affairs committee, was responsible for solving problems such as the evaluation of farm implements, the grading of fertilizers, and the study of wheat field management. The village branch secretary and the deputy township head led the inspection and repair of river channels. The captains of the five production teams were responsible for leading the production of each team. In order to ensure that all spring land and wheat fields were irrigated, the river repair team organized 50 laborers to complete the new construction of seven capillary rivers and the repair of agricultural rivers in three days. The five cultivation teams used fifteen head of livestock to harrow the spring land once in four days, then sent manure, and at the same time divided out five head of livestock to plow the land and prepare for sowing. The women of the five teams were responsible for hoeing the wheat.

    After successfully completing the task of selling grain, the farmers of Guo Wangdu Village in Anyang County held a get-together with the representatives of the workers of the Yubei Cotton Mill during the Spring Festival. The workers introduced the production situation in the factory and pointed out the socialist prospects, which greatly encouraged the farmers. In order to produce more grain and cotton to support industrial construction, 141 farm households in the village eagerly requested to join the cooperative. The village branch, on the one hand, thoroughly implemented the propaganda and education of the mutual aid and cooperation policy and carried out the preparatory work for building the cooperative, and on the other hand, led the masses to formulate mutual aid, cooperation, and production plans, ensuring that the village's grain output will increase by 130,000 jin next year. Now they have begun intensive work such as plowing, watering wheat, accumulating fertilizer, and preventing and controlling pests. 1,100 mu of wheat has been watered once and hoed once; more than 586,000 jin of fertilizer has been accumulated. And they are actively preparing to establish a large cooperative of more than 100 households based on the "Pioneer Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" led by Lu Daoping, the secretary of the township branch, to make full use of the machinery of the state's tractor station for cultivation.

    Since the implementation of the general line in Henan Province, according to incomplete statistics, the province trained 2,693 cadres for building cooperatives last winter, and a total of 10,985 key personnel for building and running cooperatives and accounting personnel. They will be the backbone force to ensure the completion of the development of 3,600 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province before the autumn harvest this year.

    河南省结合春耕生产发展互助合作组织
    河南省的互助合作运动正密切结合春耕生产蓬勃发展。到二月中旬止，全省农业生产合作社已由原有的八百五十二个发展到两千一百三十个，有六百二十个老社也扩大了，参加社的户数增加了百分之五十四。现在组织起来的农户，已达到全省农户总数的百分之五十四，比一九五三年冬季增加了百分之十二。
    河南各地干部在“边生产，边建社。”“搞好生产，争取入社。”“制订建社计划的同时制订生产计划。”等口号下，积极领导建社工作。获嘉县贺庄乡在以马应选社为基础建立“红旗农业生产合作社”时，村支部与社干部在解决社员入社的具体问题的同时，就领导大家讨论和安排春季生产，展开了锄麦保墒工作。乡支部书记领导社务委员会的干部组成的评议小组，负责解决农具评价、肥料评等级、研究麦田管理等问题。村支部书记和副乡长领导检查整修河道。五个生产队的队长负责领导各队生产。修河组为保证春地和麦地全部浇上水，组织了五十个劳力三天完成了新修七条毛河和补修农河工程。五个耕作队使用十五犋牲口，四天就把春地耙完一遍，接着就送粪，同时分出五犋牲口犁地，并作好播种的准备工作。五个队的妇女负责锄麦。
    安阳县郭王度村农民胜利完成了售粮工作后，曾在春节和豫北纱厂工人代表进行了联欢，工人介绍了厂内的生产情况，指出了社会主义远景，对农民鼓舞很大，为了多打粮食和棉花支援工业建设，全村有一百四十一户农民迫切要求入社。村支部一面深入贯彻互助合作政策的宣传教育，进行建社的准备工作，一面领导群众订出互助合作和生产计划。保证明年全村增产粮食十三万斤。现在已紧张地开始了犁地、浇麦、积肥、防治虫害等工作。一千一百亩小麦，已浇了一次水，锄了一遍；积肥五十八万六千多斤。并且正在积极准备以乡支部书记路道平领导的“先锋农业生产合作社”为基础，成立一个百余户的大社，充分利用国家的拖拉机站的机械进行耕种。
    河南省从贯彻总路线以来，据不完全统计，全省去冬训练建社干部二千六百九十三人，建社、办社骨干和会计人员共一万零九百八十五人。他们将是保证完成全省在今年秋收以前发展到三千六百个农业生产合作社的骨干力量。
