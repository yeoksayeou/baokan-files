Conserving the use of raw materials and utilizing waste materials are important methods for reducing product costs and accumulating more construction funds for the country. However, the waste of raw materials in some enterprises is very serious. In Northeast China's local state-owned industries, raw materials account for 60% to 75% of the total cost in many industries. In the past, due to the lack of unified regulations for cutting materials and utilizing waste materials, 18% to 40% of the raw materials were wasted in vain during the production process or sold at a reduced price due to unreasonable utilization. For example, the yarn loss rate of knitting factories in Dalian, Liaodong, Songjiang, and Longjiang when making velvet shirts averaged 18.6% before September last year, and remained around 15% in the second half of the year, while the loss rate of knitting factories in Shanghai was only 12%. This means that more than 3% of the yarn was wasted compared to Shanghai. If calculated based on the production of velvet shirts and spring and autumn clothing by these four factories in 1953, the annual consumption of cotton yarn was 513 tons more than that of Shanghai factories. The utilization rate of wood is also very low. The Songjiang Plywood Factory only reached 46.43%, and the Changchun Plywood Factory only reached 42.35%, while the wood utilization rate of Shanghai factories reached 80%. That is to say, compared with Shanghai factories, Northeast China's local state-owned factories wasted 35% to 37% more wood. Before August last year, the iron sheet utilization rate of Northeast China's local state-owned enamel factories was only 67% to 76%. By the end of September, more than 430 tons of iron sheet had been wasted. The average pulp loss in paper mills is about 11%. According to incomplete statistics, the value of pulp lost in the first half of 1953 was 4.102 billion yuan. The amount of waste materials such as secondary materials from other timber factories and match factories, iron plate scraps cut off from metal and agricultural tool factories, leather scraps from leather factories, and cloth scraps cut off from clothing factories is also considerable. The Shenyang Farm Implement Factory alone had 100 tons of iron plate scraps in stock in September last year, and the Lüda Garment Factory had 20 kilograms of waste material every day.

    The above is only the material wasted in various industries of local state-owned industries. Other items such as the 200 tons of waste iron scraps from four state-owned machinery factories in Shenyang every quarter, and waste iron frames in engineering areas are not included. If we start with rational cutting and vigorously utilizing waste materials, the vast majority can be used as good materials. If the utilization rate of the above raw materials can be increased by 5%, the total cost of these products can be reduced by 3% to 4%, and the country can save thousands of billions of yuan each year. As long as we pay a little attention and take necessary specific measures to save raw materials and utilize waste materials, we can accumulate more construction funds for the country and provide the people with cheaper products. However, some comrades carelessly believe: "Eating will also drop some rice grains, let alone such a large factory, this little waste is nothing!" This idea is undoubtedly wrong.

    Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, the leading comrades of many local state-owned enterprises in Northeast China have initially paid attention to the work of saving raw materials. With the efforts of the workers, some enterprises have also begun to create many methods for saving raw materials and utilizing waste materials in recent months.

    In September last year, the Northeast Local Industry Bureau organized tailoring personnel from knitting factories to conduct a pilot project on rational tailoring at the Dalian Knitting Factory. Finally, tailoring regulations were formulated, and the following four experiences were summarized based on the situation of similar industries: (1) Using nesting: adopting methods such as tip-to-tip, corner-to-corner, curve-to-curve, trouser legs nesting sleeves, and small circles nesting in the middle of large circles; (2) Changing new specifications without affecting the use; (3) In the case where raw materials are not suitable for nesting, the method of cutting small materials to squeeze large materials can be used, that is, fully utilizing the small materials usually cut off, and the large materials will be saved over time; (4) Measuring multiple times and cutting according to the diagram. After the Dalian Knitting Factory adopted rational tailoring based on the above experience starting in the fourth quarter of last year, the loss rate of No. 36 spring and autumn clothing was reduced from 9.91% to 4.1%. The consumption of No. 38 open velvet pants was also reduced from 50,755 inches per dozen to 48,000 inches, saving 5.4% of the entire material compared to the original. According to inaccurate statistics of four products in the fourth quarter of last year alone, more than 129 million yuan can be saved. If all four major knitting factories in Northeast China can carry out rational cutting, more than 1.12 billion yuan can be saved in the fourth quarter of last year alone.

    Since the Dalian Enamel Factory implemented the method of cutting materials according to the diagram in August last year, the utilization rate of iron sheet has increased from 77% to 86.4%. By the end of December last year, the factory had saved more than 20 tons of iron sheet. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Dalian Wood Furniture Factory used waste materials and secondary materials to make wooden boxes, and small materials to make furniture parts, which not only saved a lot of large materials, but also saved the country 1.5 billion yuan in the fourth quarter. These facts all show that it is entirely possible for our local state-owned enterprises to improve the utilization rate of raw materials and reduce production costs.

    In addition to improving the utilization rate of raw materials, according to the utilization of waste materials by some factories, the amount is also very large. For example, in the increase production and practice economy movement, the Dalian Printing and Dyeing Factory used boilers to add return water pipes and flue hot water pipes. The temperature of the recovered water is 50 degrees Celsius, which can save one-quarter of the coal. The annual savings can be 2,145 tons of coal and 3,500 tons of water, which can save the country 580 million yuan. The Lüda Municipal Industrial Bureau decided to start using waste materials for production in the fourth quarter of last year, and has established a toy workshop attached to the technical office to produce various toys using the waste materials from various factories. For example, using waste velvet from knitting factories to make rabbits, bears, and babies; using wood left over from timber factories and waste iron sheets left over from enamel factories to make various toys. These toys made from waste materials are very popular among the masses because of their low price and good quality. Last year, the Songjiang Plywood Factory and Match Factory used wood waste to produce more than 89,000 pieces of particleboard for basic construction, which can increase income by more than 600 million yuan.

    How to organize the utilization of waste materials? This needs to be determined separately according to the supply, production, and sales situation: If the technology for utilizing waste materials to make products is not complicated, the waste materials are not too much, and the equipment is simple, then affiliated workshops or work sections can be established. For example, currently, children's clothing on the market is in short supply. Each knitting factory can draw people to establish children's clothing workshops or work sections, which is both economical and convenient. If there are not many raw materials, the technology is high, and the factory does not have the ability to operate, the relevant leading departments can designate to sell them to specialized factories for use. For example, broken cloth and waste yarn from knitting factories can be sold to paper mills to make pulp. If the production of waste materials has many varieties, large quantities, complex product technology, and the market needs to be expanded, then a separate comprehensive processing factory can be established, which is convenient for centralized management and strengthening leadership, and can more reasonably utilize all usable raw materials and waste materials.

    节约原材料和利用废料是地方工业降低成本的重要方法
    东北地方工业局局长　李益三
    节约使用原材料、利用废料，是降低产品成本，为国家积累更多的建设资金的重要方法。但若干企业浪费原材料的情形是很严重的。东北地方国营工业中，有许多行业的原材料占总成本的百分之六十到百分之七十五，但在这些行业中，过去由于没有统一的剪裁材料和利用废料的规定，有百分之十八到百分之四十的原材料，在生产过程中白白地浪费掉，或者未能合理利用而贬价出售了。如大连、辽东、松江、龙江等针织厂制绒衣用纱的损耗率，去年九月以前平均有百分之十八点六，下半年仍在百分之十五左右，而上海各针织厂的损耗率只有百分之十二。这就是说，与上海相比，有百分之三以上的纱被浪费掉了。如果以这四个厂在一九五三年生产绒衣及春秋衣计算，全年比上海各厂多损耗棉纱五一三吨。木材的利用率也很低，松江胶合板厂只达百分之四十六点四三，长春胶合板厂只有百分之四十二点三五，而上海各厂的木材利用率则有百分之八十。即是说与上海各厂相比，东北地方国营各厂多浪费了百分之三十五到三十七的木材。东北地方国营搪瓷工厂去年八月前的铁皮利用率只有百分之六十七到七十六，到九月底耗损的铁皮共有四百三十余吨之多。造纸厂的纸浆流失量，平均在百分之十一左右，据不完全统计，一九五三年上半年流失的纸浆值四十一亿零二百万元。其他木材厂、火柴厂的次材，五金农具厂裁掉下的铁板边子，皮革厂的碎皮，服装厂剪下的布边等等，浪费的数量也是很可观的。仅沈阳农具厂去年九月份的铁板边就存有一百吨，旅大市被服厂一天就有二十公斤废料。
    以上仅是地方国营工业各行业中所浪费掉的材料，其他像沈阳四个国营机械厂每季的二○○吨废铁边子，工程地区废铁架子等等，都还没有算在内，若能从合理裁断与大力利用废材着手，则绝大部分都是可以作好料使用的。如果能把以上的原材料利用率提高百分之五，这些产品的总成本即可以降低百分之三至百分之四，每年可为国家节约数千亿元。我们只要稍为注意一下，并采取必要的具体措施节约原材料和利用废料，就可以为国家多积累建设资金，可供给人民以价钱更低廉的产品。但有些同志却满不在乎地认为：“吃饭还要掉些饭粒子，何况这样大的工厂，这点浪费算不了啥！”这种想法无疑是错误的。
    增产节约运动开展后，东北许多地方国营企业的领导同志初步注意了节约原材料的工作，几个月来在职工群众的努力下，有些企业也开始创造出了不少节省原材料和利用废料的方法。
    去年九月，东北地方工业局曾组织了针织厂裁剪人员到大连针织厂进行合理裁剪的试点工作，最后制定了裁剪规程，并根据相近几个行业的情况综合出以下四条经验：（一）利用套裁：采用尖套尖、角套角、弯套弯、裤腿套袖子、大圆中间套小圆等办法；（二）在不影响用途下改变新规格；（三）在原料不便用套裁方法的情况下，则可用小料挤大料的裁法，即充分利用平常剪下的小料，日久大料就节约下来了；（四）多次衡量与按图裁剪。大连针织厂从去年第四季度开始根据上述经验采用合理裁剪后，三六号春秋衣耗损率由百分之九点九一降低到百分之四点一。三八号开口绒裤也由每打用料五○七五五吋降到四八○○○吋，比原来节省整料百分之五点四。仅据去年第四季度四种产品不精确的统计，即可节约一亿二千九百多万元。若全东北四个主要针织厂都能进行合理剪裁，光去年第四季度就可节约十一亿二千余万元。
    大连搪瓷厂从去年八月实行按图裁料法后，铁皮利用率已从百分之七十七提高到百分之八十六点四，该厂到去年十二月底就节约铁皮二十余吨。大连木材家具厂去年第四季度利用废料及次材做木箱，用小材做家具零件，不仅节省了很多大材，而且第四季度即为国家节省了十五亿元。这些事实都说明了我们地方国营企业中完全有可能提高原材料利用率，降低生产成本的。
    除了提高原材料利用率外，据某些厂利用废料的情况看来，其数目也是很大的。如大连印染厂在增产节约运动中，利用锅炉增设回水管及烟道温水管，其回收之水温度在摄氏五十度即可省煤四分之一，全年可节省煤二一四五吨，水三五○○吨，可以为国家节约五亿八千万元。旅大市工业局在去年第四季度已决定开始利用废料生产，并已在技术室附设一个玩具车间，利用各厂的废料生产各种玩具。如把针织厂废料绒布做成兔子、狗熊、小宝宝；把制材厂剩下的木头，搪瓷厂剩下的废铁皮做成各种玩具。这些用废料做成的玩具，因为价廉物美，很受群众欢迎。松江胶合板厂与火柴厂去年利用木材废料，生产基本建设用的刨花板八万九千余块，可增加六亿余元的收入。
    怎样组织利用废料呢？这须根据供产销的情况分别确定：若利用废料制品技术性不复杂，废料不太多，设备简单，则可成立附属车间或工段，如当前市上儿童衣服供不应求，各针织厂可抽人成立小孩衣服车间或工段，这样，既节约，又方便。若原料又不多，技术性又大，本厂又无能力经营者，可由有关领导部门指定售给专厂使用，如针织厂的碎布废纱可卖给造纸厂做纸浆。若利用废料生产，品种多、数量大，制品技术性复杂，市场又需要扩大，则可单独成立一个综合性的加工工厂，这样便于集中管理与加强领导，而且更可以合理地利用一切可以利用的原料和废料。
