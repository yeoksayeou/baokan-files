Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Since the Turkish and Pakistani governments announced that the Turko-Pakistani Pact had been agreed upon and was ready to be signed, strong opposition has been expressed by various countries in the Middle East and Near East.

    The Turko-Pakistani Pact was first met with opposition from the people of Pakistan.

  "Pakistan Times" stated: This pact "is a definite step in Pakistan's close integration with the West's plans for consolidating imperialism and preparing for war." The newspaper pointed out: "It is very obvious that it is a measure implemented under the suggestion of Washington," and this pact "will clear the way for the United States to establish a military bloc in the Middle East." The newspaper also said: this pact "also involves the surrender of part of Pakistan's sovereignty." When discussing the nature of this pact, Pakistan's "People's Daily" pointed out: "This will never lead to peace, but will lead to the path of war and destruction."

    Immediately after the Turko-Pakistani Pact was reached, the United States intensified its preparations to pull Iraq into the pact. However, this conspiracy by the United States was met with strong protests from the Iraqi public. In Baghdad, National Democratic Party leader Kamel Chaderchi and Istiqlal Party leader Kuba sent a memorandum to Iraqi Prime Minister Jamali, requesting him not to take any action that would make Iraq participate in the Turko-Pakistani Pact.

    The Iraqi newspaper "People's Echo" recently published a statement signed by 3,500 people, stating: "We warn those culprits and declare that the people of all countries are fully determined to smash any treaty or imperialist war plan that aims to enslave us or tie us to the imperialist war chariot." The newspaper also published a protest letter from the students and peace fighters of Mosul, warning the Iraqi government not to join this group. In addition, a declaration signed by 129 lawyers in Baghdad was also published. The declaration stated, "The government intends to bind Iraq to this alliance, which is only beneficial to the aggressive goals of the imperialists." Iraqi peace fighters also recently issued a declaration supporting the condemnation by the Iraqi National Democratic Party and the Iraqi Istiqlal Party of the attempt to drag Iraq into the Turko-Pakistani group.

    On March 27th, students in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, held a demonstration strongly opposing the Turko-Pakistani Pact and Iraq's preparation to participate in the pact. Demonstrators held signs with slogans such as "Down with the Pakistani-Turkish-Iraqi Alliance" and "Down with the U.S. bilateral agreements." Students from the American University established by the United States in Lebanon also participated in the demonstration. In protest against the police shooting at the demonstrating students, Lebanese student organizations decided to hold a general strike on the 29th.

    The movement of the Syrian people against the American conspiracy to cobble together a Middle East aggressive bloc is growing. Residents of Damascus and other regions, in their letters to the Syrian Prime Minister, expressed their firm opposition to the American plan to cobble together a Middle East bloc. Recently, students in the Syrian capital also held demonstrations, which were also attended by Ba'ath Party members and their supporters.

    The Saudi Arabian government rejected American military "aid." India's "Assam Tribune," in commenting on this matter, pointed out that the American action did not strengthen peace in the slightest. The Saudi Arabian government's rejection of American military "aid" was "a blow to America's Middle East defense intentions." Israeli newspapers also expressed strong opposition to Iraq's preparation to participate in the Turko-Pakistani Pact. A commentator on Jerusalem Radio said on the 14th that Israel would resolutely defend its independence and resist any aggression.

    Iran's "Ajelling Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Danger Threatening Middle Eastern Countries," criticizing the Turko-Pakistani Pact. The editorial pointed out: The participation of Middle Eastern countries in any military bloc "will only bring poverty, disaster, and greater dependence to these countries." Therefore, "we have the right to warn other countries not to follow the path taken by Pakistan."

    Afghanistan's "Friendship News" condemned the Turko-Pakistani Pact as an action by the United States to deprive Asia of security and endanger overall peace and security. Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan told Kabul newspapers that Afghanistan could not participate in the Turko-Pakistani Pact.

    The Turko-Pakistani Pact is an aggressive conspiracy by the United States against Arab and Islamic countries. Egypt's "Republic" newspaper criticized in an editorial: "We can definitely tell the Turkish Foreign Minister and the responsible leaders in Washington: The Arab and Islamic peoples of the Middle East refuse to walk into the door of imperialism with the banners of 'joint defense,' 'Middle East Command,' and other slogans. No new imperialist alliance, no matter what beautiful name it is given, can make the people of the Islamic and Arab countries of the Middle East sell their national freedom or give up the struggle against imperialism and its conspiracies."

    中近东各国强烈反对美国制造的土巴协定
    【新华社二十九日讯】自土耳其和巴基斯坦政府宣布土巴协定已达成协议并准备签订以来，中近东各国纷纷表示了强烈的反对。
    土巴协定首先遭到了巴基斯坦人民的反对。
  “巴基斯坦时报”说：这个协定“是巴基斯坦与西方的巩固帝国主义的计划和备战计划密切结合的一个肯定步骤”。该报指出：“非常明显，它是在华盛顿建议下实行的措施”，这个协定“将为美国在中东建立一个军事集团扫清道路”。该报并说：这个协定“还要出让巴基斯坦的一部分主权”。巴基斯坦“人民报”在谈到这个协定的性质时指出：
  “这就决不会是导向和平，而将是导向战争和破坏的道路”。
    紧接着土巴协定达成协议，美国就加紧准备把伊拉克拉进这个协定。但是美国的这一阴谋活动，遭到了伊拉克公众的强烈抗议。在巴格达，国家民主党领袖卡迈尔·查大基和独立党领袖库巴把备忘录送给伊拉克首相贾马利，要求他不要采取任何使伊拉克参加土巴协定的行动。
    伊拉克报纸“人民回声报”最近刊载了一个有三千五百人签名的声明，声明说：“我们警告那些罪魁，并且宣布：各国人民有充分的决心粉碎任何目的在于奴役我们或把我们绑在帝国主义战车上的条约或帝国主义的战争计划。”该报还刊载了摩苏尔的学生和平战士的抗议书，警告伊拉克政府不要加入这个集团。此外还公布了巴格达的一百二十九名律师签署的宣言。宣言说，“政府打算使伊拉克受这个同盟的约束，这样做只是对于帝国主义者的侵略目标有利。”伊拉克的和平战士最近也发表了一个宣言，支持伊拉克国家民主党和伊拉克独立党提出的对于把伊拉克拖进土巴集团的企图的谴责。
    黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特学生三月二十七日举行示威运动强烈反对土巴协定和伊拉克准备参加这个协定。示威者高举着“打倒巴—土—伊拉克同盟”， “打倒美国的双边协定”等口号牌。美国在黎巴嫩设立的美国大学的学生也参加了示威运动。为了抗议警察对游行学生的射击，黎巴嫩各学生组织决定在二十九日举行总罢课。
    叙利亚人民反对美国阴谋拼凑中东侵略集团的运动正日益扩大。大马士革等区居民在他们致叙利亚总理的信中，表示坚决反对美国拼凑中东集团的计划。最近，叙利亚首都学生也举行了示威游行，参加游行的还有复兴党员及其拥护者。
    沙特阿拉伯政府拒绝了美国的军事“援助”。印度的“阿萨姆论坛报”在评论这件事时指出，美国的行动丝毫也没有加强和平。沙特阿拉伯政府拒绝美国军事“援助”是“给美国的中东防务意图一个打击”。以色列报纸对伊拉克准备参加土巴协定也表示了强烈的反对，耶路撒冷电台评论员十四日说，以色列将坚决保卫独立并抵抗任何侵略。
    伊朗的“阿杰灵报”以“威胁着中东国家的危险”为题发表社论抨击土巴协定。社论指出：中东国家参加任何军事集团“只会给这些国家带来贫穷、灾害和更大的依赖性”。因此，“我们有权警告其他国家不要走巴基斯坦所走的道路”。
    阿富汗的“友谊报”谴责土巴协定是美国剥夺亚洲安全，并危害整个和平与安全的行动。阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗曾向喀布尔的报纸说，阿富汗不能参加土巴协定。
    土巴协定是美国对阿拉伯与回教国家的侵略阴谋。埃及的“共和国报”在社论中抨击说：“我们可以肯定告诉土耳其外交部长与华盛顿的负责领袖：中东的阿拉伯和回教人民拒绝走进帝国主义挂着‘共同防御’，‘中东司令部’以及其他招牌的大门。任何新的帝国主义联盟，无论它冠以什么样的美名，都不能使中东的回教国家和阿拉伯国家的人民出卖自己的民族自由，或是放弃对帝国主义及其阴谋的斗争。”
