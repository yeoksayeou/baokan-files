Farmers in Hezuo Township, Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, are actively developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and carrying out spring plowing and production after the general line propaganda and grain planned purchase. Before the grain purchase, there were two agricultural production cooperatives, thirty-one year-round mutual aid teams, and nine temporary mutual aid teams in the township. After the grain purchase, this increased to four agricultural production cooperatives and thirty-four year-round mutual aid teams. Including farmers participating in temporary mutual aid teams, the organized households accounted for 80.6% of the total number of households in the township. There are already 470 farmer households participating in the supply and marketing cooperative in this district, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of households in the township. Surplus grain households in the township, after selling more than 230,000 jin of surplus grain, in addition to pooling shares in the township to establish a credit cooperative, also used 87% of the surplus grain funds to purchase production materials and expand reproduction. Before the grain purchase, the township had 217 head of draft animals; after the grain purchase, it increased to 285 head, and the purchased livestock were all high mules and large horses. The purchase of various farm tools also increased by more than 30%.

The members of the Moru Xin Agricultural Production Cooperative, after receiving the general line education, took the lead in selling 39,000 jin of surplus grain, driving the farmers of the entire township. In order to further develop production and increase income, they purchased rubber-tired carts and mules, built a flour mill with three sets of millstones, and raised more than 40 pigs. Under the influence of the general line education and the actions of cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the production enthusiasm of the farmers in the whole township has also been unprecedentedly high. Everyone is adding carts and buying horses, and investing surplus money in production in a planned way. Farmer Mo Rulong used to hoard surplus grain in cellars. This time, in order to develop production and move towards socialism, he turned "dead treasure into living treasure," sold his surplus grain, and purchased a large cart, a horse, and two donkeys. Farmer Jian Yide, after selling 2,500 jin of surplus grain, paid attention to saving money during the Spring Festival and stored the money in the People's Bank, preparing to buy mules. Farmer Wang Denghai used to have manure piled up in front of his door after the Spring Festival because of a lack of livestock. This year, he used the money he earned from selling surplus grain to buy a horse and sent all the manure to the fields before the Spring Festival.

At present, the vast number of farmers in the township have begun spring plowing. The fields have been plowed and harrowed smoothly. Each household is sending manure to the fields, and women are selecting seeds in the sun, actively preparing for spring planting. (Yao Yizhuang, Bai Huai)

    宁夏平罗县合作乡农民积极进行春耕生产
    宁夏省平罗县合作乡农民，经过总路线宣传和粮食计划收购以后，积极发展互助合作运动，开展春耕生产。该乡在购粮前原有二个农业生产合作社，三十一个常年互助组，九个临时互助组，购粮后即增加到四个农业生产合作社，三十四个常年互助组，连同参加临时互助组的已组织起来的农户，占全乡总农户的百分之八十点六。参加本区供销合作社的农户，已有四百七十户，占全乡总户数的百分之九十以上。全乡的余粮户，他们在出售二十三万多斤余粮后，除在本乡集股建立信用合作社外，并将百分之八十七的余粮款，添购生产资料，扩大再生产。全乡在购粮前计有二百十七头耕畜，购粮后就增购达二百八十五头，而且买进的牲口都是高骡大马。各种农具也增购达百分之三十以上。
    莫如信农业生产合作社的社员们，自受到总路线教育，带动全乡农民一次卖清余粮三万九千斤以后，为了进一步发展生产，增加收入，就添置胶轮大车和骡子，新建一座拥有三盘磨的粉坊，还养猪四十多只。全乡农民们在受到总路线教育，和在合作社、互助组的行动影响下，生产情绪也都空前高涨，大家添车买马，有计划地把余钱投入生产。农民莫如龙，过去是把余粮窖起来的，这次为了发展生产，走到社会主义，他把“死宝变活宝”，出卖了余粮，就添购了一辆大车，一匹马和两头驴。农民简易德卖了二千五百斤余粮后，在过春节时都注意节省，把钱储存到人民银行去，准备添买骡子。农民王登海过去因为缺牲口，过了春节粪还在门前堆着，今年他用出售余粮所得的钱买了一匹马，在春节前就把粪全部送到地里去了。
    目前，该乡广大农民已经开始春耕，田地已耕耙得平平整整，各户纷纷向地里送粪，妇女们也都在阳光下挑选种籽，积极准备春种。（姚以壮　白槐）
