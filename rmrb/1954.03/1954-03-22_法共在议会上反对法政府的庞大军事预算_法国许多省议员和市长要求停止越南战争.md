Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 19th: The French National Assembly has been discussing the 1954 military budget案 since the 16th. According to regulations, the budget案 should have been approved by the parliament at the end of last year. However, due to unresolved financial and economic difficulties, the passage of the budget案 has been shelved. Even now, France's military spending has to be approved on a monthly basis.

According to the report submitted to the National Assembly by Mr. Bino, the rapporteur of the National Assembly's Finance Committee, France's total military budget for this year is 1,110.5 billion francs. This huge sum is mainly for continuing the Indochina War and so-called "defense" expenses under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Bino pointed out in the report that the cost of the Indochina War is a total of 686 billion francs. Of the total war expenses, 490 billion francs is so-called "aid" from the United States, of which 335 billion francs is directly given by the United States to the so-called member states of the Indochina Federation.

General Juinville spoke on behalf of the French Communist Party during the discussion, opposing this military budget. He emphasized that this budget is a budget to maintain foreign interests because "it increases the suffering of the French armed forces." He suggested reducing the current military appropriation by 300 billion francs to build houses to solve the serious housing shortage.

According to "Liberation," French Socialist Party members have decided to vote against this budget. This is the first time the Socialist Party has made such a decision since France was liberated from Hitler's occupation.

Xinhua News Agency, March 21st: TASS Paris, March 20th: "L'Humanité" reported that in the past few days, eleven provincial council members, forty-five mayors, and two hundred and sixty municipal council members in the Lot-et-Garonne province formally requested an immediate armistice agreement with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In Agen, a town in Lot-et-Garonne, almost all the municipal council members are in favor of concluding an armistice agreement with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    法共在议会上反对法政府的庞大军事预算
    法国许多省议员和市长要求停止越南战争
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会从十六日起讨论一九五四年的军事预算案。按照规定，预算案早在去年年底就应该由议会通过。但是，由于财政经济困难无法解决，预算案的通过也就搁置下来。一直到现在，法国的军费开支还得逐月批准。
    根据国民议会财政委员会报告员比诺向国民议会提出的报告，今年法国的军事预算总额是一万一千一百零五亿法郎。这笔数目庞大的款项主要是为了继续印度支那战争和北大西洋公约下的所谓“防务”费用。比诺在报告中指出印度支那战争费用共六千八百六十亿法郎。全部战争费用中有四千九百亿法郎是所谓美国的“援助”，其中三千三百五十亿法郎是由美国直接给予所谓印度支那联邦成员国的。
    儒恩维尔将军代表法国共产党在讨论中发言，反对这个军事预算。他着重指出：这个预算是维护外国利益的预算，因为“它增加法国武装部队的痛苦”。他建议把目前的军事拨款削减三千亿法郎用来建筑房屋，以解决严重的房荒。
    据“解放报”消息，法国社会党议员已经决定投票反对这个预算。社会党作出这样的决定，还是法国从希特勒占领下解放以来的第一次。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：“人道报”报道，在过去几天中，罗特—加隆省的十一个省议会议员、四十五个市长和二百六十个市政委员会委员正式要求立即和越南民主共和国政府缔结停战协定。在罗特—加隆省的一个城镇亚仁，差不多所有的市政委员会委员都赞成和越南民主共和国政府缔结停战协定。
