Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) units, services, and schools have basically concluded their subscriptions for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. According to incomplete statistics, the entire army has over-subscribed by 273% of the projected amount. Currently, many PLA units have already paid their bond subscriptions, and most units plan to complete their payments by the end of March.

The vast majority of officers in the PLA have enthusiastically subscribed to the bonds based on the principles of voluntarism and within their financial means. Leading organs at all levels have taken the lead in subscribing, with military and political leaders, heroes, model workers, members of the Communist Party of China, and members of the New Democratic Youth League of China playing a leading role in the subscription process. Wei Xiaotang, a combat hero from the Southwest Military Region, and others have used all their accumulated allowances to purchase bonds. Jiang Xinghai, a wounded soldier who lost his sight in the bandit suppression operations, immediately purchased bonds worth 800,000 yuan with his savings upon hearing the news of the bond issuance. Some troops stationed on the frontiers and coastal islands concentrated a large amount of cash to subscribe as soon as they heard the news of the state issuing economic construction bonds on the radio. A unit undertaking arduous road construction tasks on the Kangzang Plateau completed its subscription in three hours after mobilization, exceeding the projected number by 23 times. The entire army of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army completed its subscription in five days, exceeding the original number by 263.9%. The Shanghai Garrison completed its subscription plan ahead of schedule on January 20 and paid the money to the People's Bank on February 8. Yu Fushun, the company commander of a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region, immediately purchased bonds worth 2 million yuan, his life savings, at a military conference. Wu Yunfeng, a cadre of the Weinan Military Sub-district in Shaanxi, used his accumulated savings of more than 3 million yuan from over two years to buy bonds. Some cadres who were away on official business also wrote letters to their units to subscribe or entrusted others to purchase on their behalf. Many cadres not only subscribed to the bonds themselves but also wrote letters to mobilize their relatives to subscribe.

According to the regulations of the army, bonds are not promoted among soldiers, but the vast majority of soldiers still insisted on buying them. The soldiers said: For the sake of the country's socialist industrialization, we can buy a little if we cannot buy a lot, even if it's just enough to buy a screw. Li Shouzhen, a soldier from a certain company in the Rehe Military Region, lived frugally and rarely spent money on weekdays. Recently, he used all 2 million yuan he had saved over the past four years of military service to subscribe to the bonds. In some companies, 70% or even 90% of the soldiers subscribed to the bonds.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st: The entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) has overfulfilled the subscription task for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, with the total amount subscribed reaching 445.67% of the projected subscription figure.

Cadres at all levels of the CPVA demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in subscribing to the bonds. Many units completed their subscription tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas within a few short days. The CPVA leadership organs completed all their subscription work within five days of the start of the bond subscription process, with the amount subscribed reaching 556.42% of the projected figure. At a cadre meeting of a certain engineering unit, before the commander had finished reporting the significance of subscribing to the bonds, the attendees had already sent slips of paper with the amount they voluntarily subscribed to the rostrum. Within fifteen minutes after the meeting, the amount subscribed by the attendees exceeded the projected number by four times. A CPVA unit guarding the east coast exceeded the projected number by seven times in more than ten days. The CPVA logistics department exceeded the projected number by five and a half times in a very short time.

The subscription of bonds by cadres at all levels of the CPVA was carried out on the basis of vigorously publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period throughout the army. Many units also linked the subscription of bonds with the study of the general line and carried out publicity and education to the troops, so that everyone generally recognized the great significance of accumulating funds for the country.

The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army at all levels also firmly requested to subscribe to the National Economic Construction Bonds. They said that supporting the construction of the motherland is also our responsibility. In a certain unit's second company, the total amount of bonds subscribed by cadres and soldiers exceeded the projected number by 22 times in one and a half hours. Li Xiangmao, a second-class meritorious worker of a certain unit, also submitted a letter to the people of the motherland when paying the bond money. In the letter, he expressed that he would not only buy bonds to support the economic construction of the motherland, but also be vigilant at all times to defend the motherland's safe transition to a socialist society.

    解放军和志愿军广大指战员
    超额认购国家建设公债
    【新华社一日讯】中国人民解放军各部队、各兵种、各学校，现已基本上结束了认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债的工作。据不完全统计，全军已超额认购了预定数字的百分之二百七十三。目前，人民解放军不少单位已将公债款项缴清，大部分单位也准备在三月底缴款完毕。
    人民解放军中的广大干部都根据自觉自愿和量力而行的精神踊跃认购公债。各级领导机关都率先认购，军政首长、英雄、模范和中国共产党党员、中国新民主主义青年团团员，在认购过程中都起了带头作用。西南军区战斗英雄卫小堂等，都把积蓄很久的津贴费全拿出来认购公债。在剿匪作战中双目失明的伤员蒋星海，听到认购公债的消息后，也立刻把保存着的八十万元购买了公债。某些守卫在边疆和沿海岛屿上的部队，在收音机里听到国家发行经济建设公债的消息后，当时就集中了很多现款准备认购。在康藏高原上担负艰苦的修路任务的某部队，在动员后的三小时就认购完毕，并超过预定数字的二十三倍。中南军区、第四野战军全军在五天内就认购完毕，而且超过原定数字的百分之二百六十三点九。上海驻军在一月二十日即超额完成认购计划，并在二月八日向人民银行缴款完毕。东北军区某部连长于福顺，在军人大会上当场就把长年积蓄的二百万元买了公债。陕西渭南军分区干部吴云峰把两年多积下的三百万元一起买了公债。有些因公外出的干部，也都写信给本单位认购或托人代购。许多干部除自己认购公债外，还写信动员亲属认购。
    按部队规定，公债不在战士中间推销，但广大战士仍坚持要购买。战士们说：为了国家的社会主义工业化，我们不能多买也能少买，凑个螺丝钉钱也是好的。热河军区某连战士李守正生活俭朴，平日很少花钱，最近把参军四年来积蓄的二百万元全部认购了公债。某些连队有百分之七十甚至百分之九十的战士认购了公债。
   【新华社平壤一日电】中国人民志愿军全军超额完成了一九五四年国家经济建设公债的认购工作，全军认购的数目达预计认购数字的百分之四百四十五点六七。
    志愿军各级干部在认购公债中，表现了高度的爱国热情。许多单位在短短的几天内就提前并超额完成了认购工作。志愿军领导机关在开始认购公债的五天内，就全部结束了认购工作，认购数目达预计认购数字的百分之五百五十六点四二。工兵部队某部在一次干部会议上，指挥员还没有报告完认购公债的意义，到会人员就纷纷把自愿认购公债数字的条子送上主席台。会后十五分钟内，到会人员认购的数字就超过了预计数字的四倍。守卫在东海岸的志愿军某部，在十多天的时间内，认购总数超过了预计数字的七倍。志愿军后勤部门在很短的时间内，认购总数就超过了预计数字的五倍半。
    中国人民志愿军各级干部认购公债，是在全军大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线的基础上进行的。许多部队还把认购公债和学习总路线联系起来向部队进行了宣传教育，使大家普遍认识到为国家积累资金的重大意义。
    中国人民志愿军各部队的战士们，也坚决要求认购国家经济建设公债。他们说，支援祖国建设，也有咱们一份。某部二连在一个半小时内，干部和战士们认购公债的总数，就超过了预计数字的二十二倍。某部二等功臣李香茂在交公债款时，还交了一封写给祖国人民的信。他在信上表示不仅要买公债支援祖国经济建设，而且还要随时提高警惕，保卫祖国安全地过渡到社会主义社会。
