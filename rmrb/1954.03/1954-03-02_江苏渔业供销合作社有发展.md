Jiangsu Fisheries Supply and Marketing Cooperative has seen significant development in recent years. Currently, the province has thirty-seven fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives with over 63,200 members. 69% of fishermen in major seaports and lakes have joined the supply and marketing cooperatives.

Fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives have brought great benefits to fishermen. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-six fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives in the province's major seaports and lakes, over the past year, production materials such as wood, catechu bark, and ramie worth 23.9 billion yuan were supplied to fishermen, and daily necessities such as rice, flour, and cloth worth over 31.9 billion yuan were supplied. More than 540,000 dan of aquatic products were helped to be sold, valued at over 73.8 billion yuan, accounting for about 77% of the total aquatic products in these areas. By selling aquatic products and purchasing production materials and daily necessities through the supply and marketing cooperatives, fishermen have avoided being exploited by unscrupulous merchants. In the process of selling aquatic products for fishermen last year, the Zhenze County Fisheries Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone enabled fishermen to avoid more than 448 million yuan in exploitation by unscrupulous merchants. Fishermen in Dongshan Street, Xin Hailian City, could only exchange one dan of dried shrimp for sixteen jin of tung oil before liberation, but now they can exchange it for ninety jin of tung oil through the supply and marketing cooperative. Some fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives also organize family members of members to engage in production work such as netting. The Qidong County Fisheries Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized more than 450 family members of members to knit 97 nets, which not only solved the problem of fishing nets needed by members for going to sea but also increased the income of members.

In order to strengthen the leadership of fisheries supply and marketing cooperation, the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Federation convened a meeting of directors of fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives in mid-January, clearly defining the business policy of fisheries supply and marketing cooperatives, and pointed out that at present, the supply of production materials should be done well first to prepare for the arrival of the spring fishing season.

    江苏渔业供销合作社有发展
    江苏省渔业供销合作社几年来有很大发展。目前，全省有三十七个渔业供销合作社，六万三千二百多个社员；主要海港和湖泊的渔民，百分之六十九已参加了供销合作社。
    渔业供销合作社给渔民带来很大的好处。据该省主要海港和湖泊的二十六个渔业供销合作社的初步统计，一年来，供应渔民的木料、栲皮、络麻等生产资料，值二百三十九亿元，供应的米、面、布等生活资料，值三百一十九亿余元；帮渔民推销的水产品达五十四万多担，价值七百三十八亿余元，占这些地区水产品总量的百分之七十七左右。渔民通过供销合作社出售水产品，购买生产资料和生活资料，便避免了遭受奸商的中间剥削。仅震泽县渔业供销合作社在去年为渔民推销水产品的过程中，就使渔民少受奸商四亿四千八百多万元的剥削；新海连市洞山街的渔民，在解放前卖一担虾皮只能换到十六斤桐油，现在通过供销合作社，能换到九十斤桐油。有些渔业供销合作社还组织社员家属等进行结网等生产工作。启东县渔业供销合作社即组织社员家属四百五十多人结网九十七张，这样不但解决了社员出海所需要的鱼网，而且使社员增加了收入。
    江苏省合作总社为了加强对渔业供销合作的领导，在一月中旬召开了渔业供销合作社主任会议，明确确定了渔业供销合作社的经营方针，并指出目前应首先作好生产资料的供应工作，为春季渔汛的到来作好准备。
