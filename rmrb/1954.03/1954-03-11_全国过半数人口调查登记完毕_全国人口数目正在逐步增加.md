Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The national population survey and registration work, which is being carried out in conjunction with the general election movement, has now been completed in 60 percent of the population.

Materials from completed survey areas show that the population is gradually increasing. According to statistics from 23 counties and banners in seven provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the resident population has increased by 4.1 percent compared to the total population figures in the "National Population Statistics Booklet" compiled by the Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government in January 1953. According to statistics from Rehe Province, among the 21 counties, cities, and banners in the province, except for Luanping County, where the population slightly decreased due to changes in administrative divisions, the population of the other 20 units has increased. The population increase rate is highest in cities. According to materials from 25 cities, including Anshan and Fushun, the resident population has increased by an average of 9.9 percent compared to the originally reported total population. The reasons for the population increase include, in addition to the accurate registration of past omissions, the comprehensive statistics of public households such as institutions, schools, and factories and mines that were not registered in the past, and the population increase due to the development of industrial construction in cities and industrial and mining areas. The main reasons are the stability and improvement of people's lives after liberation, the progress of medical and health conditions, and the promotion of new midwifery methods, which have increased the birth rate, reduced the mortality rate, and significantly increased the natural growth rate of China's population. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Population Survey and Registration Office of Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, in Ailing and Shengli townships in the county, the average annual birth rate of the two townships was 33.64 per thousand, the death rate was 19.34 per thousand, and the increase rate was 14.3 per thousand in the two years from June 1951 to June 1953. If we look at the typical surveys conducted by the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of Interior, the People's Armed Forces Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and the Population Survey and Registration Office of Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, in a total of 37 units, including 29 cities, 5 counties, 2 townships, and 1 village, in 1952 and 1953, the average annual birth rate was 38 per thousand, the death rate was 11 per thousand, and the actual increase was 27 per thousand.

According to the report materials received by the Central Population Survey and Registration Office from various places, the population survey and registration work has basically met the requirements of "no repetition, no omission, comprehensive, and accurate" and has obtained nearly completely accurate population figures due to the attention of local leading organs and the support of the broad masses of the people. From the results of re-examination and random checks of the population that has been surveyed and registered in some areas, the accuracy rate has reached more than 99.5 percent.

As of the end of February, nine provinces, including Liaodong, Jilin, Rehe, and Xinjiang, and ten cities, including Shanghai, Anshan, Xi'an, and Chongqing, have completed the population survey and registration work; the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and six provinces, including Sichuan and Jiangsu, and four cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, have basically completed it; and thirteen other provinces, including Shandong and Hunan, have also completed the survey in some areas.

    全国过半数人口调查登记完毕
    全国人口数目正在逐步增加
      【新华社十日讯】结合普选运动进行的全国人口调查登记工作，目前已在百分之六十的人口中完成。
    从已完成调查地区的材料说明，人口的数目正在逐步增加。根据七个省及内蒙古自治区共二十三个县、旗的统计，常住人口比中央人民政府内务部一九五三年一月汇编的“全国人口统计简册”的总人口数字增加了百分之四点一。热河省的统计，全省二十一个县、市、旗单位中，除滦平县因行政区划变动，人口略有减少外，其他二十个单位人口都有增加。人口增加比率最多的是城市。根据鞍山、抚顺等二十五个城市的材料，常住人口比原报总人口数平均增加了百分之九点九。人口增加的原因，除了过去还有些遗漏未报这次登记确实，过去有些机关、学校、厂矿等公共户没有登记，这次作了全面统计，以及城市和工矿地区由于工业建设的发展，人口有了增加以外，主要原因是解放以后人民生活安定和改善，医药卫生条件的进步以及新接生法的推行等，使我国人口的出生率增加，死亡率减少，自然增加率有了显著的提高。根据江苏省江宁县人口调查登记办公室在该县爱陵、胜利两乡调查的结果，一九五一年六月到一九五三年六月两年中，两个乡每年平均出生率为千分之三十三点六四，死亡率为千分之十九点三四，增加率为千分之十四点三。如果以中央人民政府公安部、内务部和人民革命军事委员会人民武装部和江苏省江宁县人口调查登记办公室等机关先后于一九五二年和一九五三年共在二十九个市、五个县、二个乡、一个村共三十七个单位的典型调查来看，平均每年每千人当中，出生三十八人，死亡十一人，实增加二十七人。
    根据中央人口调查登记办公室所收到的各地报告材料证明，由于各地领导机关重视和广大人民群众的支持，人口调查登记工作基本上都达到“不重复、不遗漏、全面、确实”的要求，取得了接近完全准确的人口数字。从部分地区对已经调查登记的人口进行复查、抽查的结果来看，准确程度都达到了百分之九十九点五以上。
    截至二月底止，全国已经完成人口调查登记工作的有辽东、吉林、热河、新疆等九个省，上海、鞍山、西安、重庆等十个市；基本上完成的有内蒙古自治区和四川、江苏等六个省及北京、天津等四个市；另有山东、湖南等十三个省也已在部分地区完成调查。
