The state-owned enterprise departments in Northeast China conscientiously implemented the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's instructions on the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. Over the past year, they have processed potential materials worth 3.3 trillion yuan.

According to incomplete statistics, the main materials processed include more than 75,000 tons of iron and steel materials, more than 5,000 tons of non-ferrous metal materials, more than 4,100 sets of mechanical equipment, and 840,000 meters of wire, all of which are necessary for production and capital construction. There were also a large number of plumbing equipment, tool parts, chemical raw materials, and other varieties; more than 30,000 rubber tires for carts needed for agricultural production; and 560,000 blankets for the supply of market living materials, as well as a large number of cotton, single clothing, various shoes, various fabrics, woolens, and salted fish. These materials are important resources for national construction and materials necessary for people's lives. After these potential materials were adjusted and processed, they played a significant role in promoting industrial and agricultural production, ensuring capital construction projects, and expanding market supply. After processing the backlog of materials, various departments accelerated capital turnover and saved national wealth. The Ministry of Fuel Industry (coal mines, electricity), the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Textile Industry alone saved the country more than 370 billion yuan after processing the backlog of production materials of their affiliated enterprises in Northeast China. A power plant urgently needed two tons of 38mm thick steel plates for a capital construction project, but was unable to purchase them anywhere, which affected the progress of the project. After being adjusted and solved from the non-ferrous metal industry bureau's backlog of materials, the needs of the project were guaranteed in a timely manner. Farmers actively increased their production and actively added production materials, but the supply of rubber tires for carts was insufficient for a while, and part of the need was solved after adjustment.

In addition, a large number of valuable materials were also found. For example, factories and mines discarded a large amount of miscellaneous copper, with a preliminary estimate of about 12,000 tons.

Over the past year, state-owned enterprise departments in Northeast China have created a lot of experience and methods in the processing of potential materials. Such as combining supply plans to check inventory; studying internal utilization and substitution under the premise of ensuring engineering, product quality, and economic principles through "backlog material exhibitions" and "visiting warehouses"; carrying out mutual adjustment within the system and between departments; handing over to commercial departments for sales; special handling of special-purpose materials; organizing processing and repairing of old equipment, etc.

In order to further promote the processing work, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee convened relevant departments to discuss and study the future work and corrected the understanding of the processing of potential materials. Now, all units are actively organizing processing according to the spirit of the meeting.

    东北国营企业部门处理了大量潜在物资
    东北地区国营企业部门认真贯彻中共中央东北局关于增产节约运动的指示。一年来处理潜在物资达三万三千余亿元。
    据不完全的统计，处理的主要物资中有生产、基本建设所必需的钢铁材料七万五千余吨，有色金属材料五千余吨，机械设备四千一百多台，线材八十四万公尺，另有大批水暖器材、工具零件、化工原料等多种；供应农业生产所需要的大车胶带三万多条和供应市场生活资料方面的毛毯五十六万条，及大批棉、单衣、各种鞋子、各种布匹、毛呢、咸鱼。这些物资都是国家建设的重要资材和人民生活所必需的物资。这些潜在物资经调剂处理后，对促进工农业生产，保证基本建设工程，扩大市场供应方面都起了很大作用。各部门处理积压物资后，加速了资金周转，节约了国家财富。仅中央人民政府燃料工业部
  （煤矿，电业）、第一机械工业部、轻工业部、纺织工业部四个系统在处理了所属东北各企业生产方面的积压物资后，即可为国家节约三千七百余亿元。某发电厂基本建设工程急需三八公厘厚的钢板两吨到处采购不到，影响了工程进行，经从有色金属工业管理局积压物资中调剂解决后，及时保证了工程的需要。农民扩大生产，积极增添生产资料，但大车胶带却一时供应不足，经调剂后解决了部分需要。
    此外还清查出大量贵重资材。如各厂矿散弃了大量杂铜，经初步统计约有一万二千余吨。
    一年来东北区各国营企业部门对潜在物资的处理工作，创造了不少经验和办法。如结合供应计划检查库存；通过“积压物资展览会”“参观仓库”研究内部利用和在保证工程、产品质量及合乎经济原则的条件下代用；进行系统内部与部门之间的相互调剂；交给商业部门推销；对特殊专用物资专行处理；对破旧器材组织加工修理等。
    东北财政经济委员会为进一步推动处理工作，曾召集各有关部门讨论和研究了今后工作、端正了对潜在物资处理工作的认识。现各单位正根据会议精神积极组织处理。
