Hang County, Zhejiang Province, convened its first session of the first County People's Congress from February 20th to 25th after completing grassroots elections. The congress elected the county head, deputy county heads, and members of the County People's Government, and passed several important resolutions.

The people's representatives attending the County People's Congress included representatives of workers, peasants, government employees, cultural and educational workers, industrialists and businesspeople, and the People's Armed Forces; women representatives accounted for more than 16 percent. These people's representatives, elected by the people's congresses of various townships and towns, are model figures most trusted and loved by the masses.

The people of the county were all jubilant and welcomed the convening of the County People's Congress with the feeling of being further masters of their own affairs. Many people's representatives received warm farewells from the local masses before going to the county for the meeting. The masses in Da'an, Chongxian, Zhangqiao and other townships in the Siwei District formulated specific production plans to welcome the convening of this congress. All members of Zhu Yongyuan's mutual aid team in the Chuanfang Township of Tangqi District wrote a letter to the presidium of the congress on the eve of the opening, expressing their determination to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1954 and putting forward specific measures to increase production.

In order to further educate the masses throughout the county on the general line, Liu Yanfa, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Hang County Committee, was invited to make a report on the transmission of the general line and general tasks of the state's transition period during the congress. After heated discussions, the representatives further clarified the essence of the general line and recognized the great significance of the worker-peasant alliance and the road of socialist transformation of agriculture. Under the guidance of the general line, the representatives expressed their determination to actively engage in production, further develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, organize the people of the county, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country.

The congress carefully reviewed the work of the Hang County People's Government over the past four years. The congress affirmed the achievements of the People's Government in its past work, and at the same time, criticized the shortcomings in its work, thereby further strengthening the relationship between the people and the People's Government. In accordance with the spirit of the general line, the congress carefully discussed the county's agricultural production targets for 1954 and the work tasks for the next four months. Based on the needs of national industrial construction, the congress determined that the general task of agricultural production in the county in 1954 was to focus on increasing the production of grain and oil crops, to produce industrial raw materials in a planned way, and to strive to increase the unit area yield of cash crops and local specialties to achieve an all-round bumper harvest. In terms of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it was decided to focus on pilot agricultural producers' cooperatives and actively improve and develop various types of mutual aid teams to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. The congress determined that the work tasks for the next four months are to continue to carry out the general line education, widely and deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and create conditions for a bumper harvest this year. At the same time, it is necessary to combine the sales and subscription of national economic construction bonds, taxation and grain procurement, supply, and political, legal, cultural, educational, and health work.

On the 24th, all the people's representatives attending the congress, with a responsible attitude, elected the county head, deputy county heads, and members of the County People's Government by secret ballot. Hu Guangqing, the original county head of the Hang County People's Government, and Li Guangxin, the deputy county head, were re-elected as county head and deputy county head respectively; Wu Yongfa, the deputy district head of Siwei District, who came from a peasant background and had been twice elected as a county and district first-class model worker, and Shen Guixing, a peasant who had been elected as a county and district labor model, preferential treatment model, and seed selection model for many times and had considerable achievements in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, were all elected as deputy county heads at this congress.

The congress closed after passing four important resolutions, including the resolution on the county's future work tasks centered on carrying out production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the resolution on promoting the sale and subscription of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds in the county.
