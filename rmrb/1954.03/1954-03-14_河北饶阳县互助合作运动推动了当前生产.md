The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, promotes current production.

    Last year, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, had 132 agricultural production cooperatives. After the promotion of the General Line and the influence of the superior achievements of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, farmers' confidence in organizing themselves greatly increased. By the end of February, more than 190 new cooperatives had been newly established in the county, and more than 240 were still discussing articles of association and other work. Of the 192 villages in the county, basically every village now has a cooperative. Mutual aid teams have also developed greatly at the same time. Under the impetus of the teams and cooperatives, all farmers have generally made preparations for spring plowing, and at present, the cooperatives are busy collecting and transporting manure, and some villages and cooperatives have completed rolling the land and have begun spring plowing.

    In the past, farmers in Raoyang had a "New Year's rest" custom, and rarely engaged in agricultural activities during the Spring Festival. This year, influenced by the teams and cooperatives, many farmers who previously had no habit of accumulating fertilizer also participated in the movement to sweep soil and accumulate fertilizer during the Spring Festival. In Nanjingtang, Xizhanggang and other 46 villages alone, more than 5,000 people participated in sweeping soil, collecting more than 3,000 cartloads of chaff and soil. According to statistics from 43 villages in the first, second, and third districts, more than 33,000 cartloads of new fertilizer were accumulated after the Spring Festival, averaging 1.5 cartloads of fertilizer per mu of land. At the same time, they also started harrowing the land early to preserve moisture. In the past, the general practice was to wait for the manure to decompose before transporting it and then harrowing the land. This year, under the promotion of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the method of harrowing the land first and then transporting the manure was adopted, which solved the contradiction of few draft animals and many farm tasks when manure was transported before harrowing in previous years.

    Because the production in the mutual aid and cooperation organizations is serious and the conditions are superior, many farmers have solved the difficulties that they could not solve when they were working independently in the past after joining, greatly changing their production and living conditions. In the Liu Baoheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Caiyuan Village, District One, 43 of the 140 households had no livestock, lacked labor, and could not plant in time when they were working independently in the past, and the grain they harvested was not enough to eat. Now, in addition to accumulating more than 1.2 million jin of crude fertilizer to ensure that each mu is fertilized with 2,000 jin, they had rolled more than 500 mu of wheat and more than 480 mu of clod land before mid-February. And they have found a way to solve the shortage of more than 40 shi of grain for 43 cooperative members from sideline production.

    河北饶阳县互助合作运动推动了当前生产
    河北省饶阳县去年原有一百三十二个农业生产合作社，经过总路线的宣传和耿长锁农业生产合作社优越成绩的影响，农民组织起来的信心大大提高，截至二月底止，全县又新建了一百九十多个新社，还有二百四十多个正在进行讨论社章等工作。全县一百九十二个村庄，已基本上达到村村有社。互助组也同时有了很大发展。全体农民在组、社的带动下，一般都提早作好了春耕生产的准备工作，目前社都在紧张地捣粪送粪，部分村、社已轧完地，开始春耕。
    饶阳农民过去原有“歇年”习惯，春节期间很少进行农事活动，今年受组、社影响，很多无积肥习惯的农民，春节期间也大都参加扫土积肥运动。仅南京堂、西张岗等四十六个村庄参加扫土的就有五千多人，扫柴沫土三千多车。另据一、二、三区四十三个村庄统计，春节后所积新肥共有三万三千多车，平均每亩地有一车半肥。同时，也都提前开始了耙地保墒。过去一般情况是等粪化通，送粪后再耙地。今年在互助合作组织的推动下，采取了先耙地后送粪的办法，解决了往年先送粪后耙地时耕畜少、农活多的矛盾。
    由于互助合作组织中生产认真、条件优越，很多农民参加后都解决了过去单干时所不能解决的困难，大大改变了生产、生活状况。一区菜元村刘保恒农业生产合作社，一百四十户中有四十三户过去单干时没牲口、缺劳力、耕种不及时，收粮不够吃。现在社内除已积好一百二十多万斤粗肥保证每亩施肥二千斤外，二月中旬以前就轧完了五百多亩小麦和四百八十多亩坷垃地。并从副业生产中找到了解决四十三户社员缺粮四十余石的门路。
