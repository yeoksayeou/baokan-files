Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: TASS, Paris, March 5th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on March 5th in Argenteuil, near Paris.

Jacques Duclos delivered a report on the tasks of the Communist Party in the struggle to prevent the revival of German militarism and to guarantee the independence and security of France. The meeting will last for two days.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: TASS, Paris, March 6th: Jacques Duclos, in his report to the plenary session of the French Communist Party Central Committee on March 5th, pointed out that since the Berlin Conference, the French working class and all the people have strengthened their struggle for world peace.

Referring to the agreements reached at the Berlin Conference, Duclos said: Greater achievements could have been made if the Western delegations had truly been willing to solve the problems. But the Berlin Conference is still a victory for the policy of consultation over the policy of force.

Referring to the Soviet plan for guaranteeing European security, Duclos stressed that the majority of the French people welcome and support the concept of collective security embodied in the plan. Duclos said that this is a real guarantee of peace for Europe. The French people will do their utmost to fight to ensure that the principle of settling disputes through consultation triumphs over the forces of the rulers who seek to undermine cooperation.

Duclos detailed the achievements of the French people in their struggle against the establishment of the "European Defence Community," for the victory of a policy of peace, and for safeguarding France's national independence. He emphasized that this struggle has attracted the broadest strata of the French people.

He pointed out that the French government has ignored Ho Chi Minh's peace talks proposals. He also emphasized that the US government is trying to maintain a hotbed of war in Indochina. Duclos called for greater efforts to strive for peace talks with the Ho Chi Minh government. He said that the French government's policy shows that it is completely dependent on the American imperialists; the American imperialists' policy is infringing upon French interests not only in the matter of continuing the Indochina war but also in the matter of reviving German militarism. He pointed out that the French economy is feeling the dangerous effects of the Schuman Plan, with mines and steel factories closing down one after another, causing unemployment. The aircraft manufacturing industry, shipbuilding industry, other major industrial sectors of France, as well as science and technology have all suffered losses due to competition from the United States and West Germany.

Duclos pointed out the poverty of the French working people and said that the working class is fighting for universal wage increases. Duclos went on to say that the General Confederation of Labour's patient and persistent efforts to expand the united action of the French working people are producing good results. For example, the leadership of the French Confederation of Christian Workers has decided to support the proposal to prepare for a twenty-four-hour strike.

He said that in the past few months, new achievements have been made in expanding the united action of the working people belonging to the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Duclos cited many examples of united action and said that Communist Party and Socialist Party workers are building new relationships, relationships that contain vast possibilities. Therefore, every effort must be made so that the united action of the working class can unite all loyal French people, so that the current policy of the French government can be changed. He said: We must courageously and promptly pursue our united front policy, because the country is facing serious problems. The Bonn and Paris treaties must be thwarted. The restoration of peace in Indochina must be guaranteed, and the demands of the working class and the working masses must be met. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the movement to win the united action of our party and the Socialist Party workers.

Duclos pointed out some shortcomings in the Communist Party's organizational work. He demanded that party cadres strengthen party organizations in industrial enterprises, raise the enthusiasm of party members, and strengthen the ties between Communist Party members and the working masses. He stressed that the strength and fighting power of the Communist Party lies in correctly applying Lenin's organizational principles of collective leadership, in unfolding criticism and self-criticism.

Finally, he emphasized that the most important task of the Communist Party at present is to fight against the "European Defence Community." He suggested that the Central Committee come to a clear view on the measures that must be taken to strengthen the struggle of the Party and the masses it leads to defeat the advocates of the "European Defence Community" in order to strive for a policy that can conform to the interests of France, a policy of national independence and peace.

    法国共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    杜克洛报告党在防止德国军国主义复活和保证法国独立与安全的斗争中的任务
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：法国共产党中央委员会全体会议五日在巴黎近郊阿葛邑举行。
    雅克·杜克洛做了关于在防止德国军国主义的复活和保证法国的独立与安全的斗争中共产党的任务的报告。会议将举行两天。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：雅克·杜克洛三月五日在法国共产党中央委员会全体会议上作报告时指出，柏林会议以后，法国工人阶级和全体人民加强了他们要求世界和平的斗争。
    杜克洛提到在柏林会议上达成的协议，他说：如果西方代表团真正愿意解决问题的话，成绩可能会更大。但柏林会议仍然是协商政策对武力政策的胜利。
    杜克洛在提到苏联的保障欧洲安全的计划时着重指出，大多数法国人民都欢迎和支持计划所体现的集体安全的观念。杜克洛说，这对欧洲是真正的和平保证。法国人民将尽全力进行斗争，使通过协商解决争端的原则战胜力图破坏合作的统治者们的力量。
    杜克洛详细地叙述了法国人民在反对成立“欧洲防务集团”、争取和平政策的胜利和保障法国的民族独立的斗争中的成就，他着重指出，这个斗争已吸引了最广大阶层的法国人民。
    他指出，法国政府未曾理会胡志明的和谈建议，他并着重指出，美国政府正在力图在印度支那保持一个战争温床。杜克洛号召作更大的努力来争取与胡志明政府举行和谈。他说，法国政府的政策表现出它是完全依赖美帝国主义者的；美帝国主义者的政策不仅在继续印度支那战争的问题上，而且在复活德国军国主义问题上都是侵犯法国的利益的。他指出，法国的经济正在感受舒曼计划的危险影响，矿场和钢铁工厂纷纷倒闭，并引起了失业。飞机制造业、造船业、法国其他主要工业部门以及科学和技术都由于美国和西德的竞争而受到了损失。
    杜克洛指出了法国劳动人民的穷困，并说，工人阶级正在为普遍增加工资而斗争。杜克洛接着说，总工会为扩大法国劳动人民的一致行动而进行的耐心的、坚持不懈的努力正在产生良好的效果。例如，法国天主教劳工联盟领导机构已决定支持准备一次二十四小时罢工的建议。
    他说，在过去几个月中，扩大属于社会党和共产党的劳动人民的一致行动的工作有了新的成就。杜克洛举出了许多一致行动的例子，并且说，共产党和社会党工人正在建立新的关系、包含着广大的可能性的关系。因此，必须作各种努力，以便工人阶级的一致行动有可能把所有忠实的法国人团结起来，使法国政府目前的政策有所改变。他说：我们必须勇敢地、及时地奉行我们的统一战线政策，因为国家面临着严重的问题。必须挫败波恩和巴黎条约。必须保证恢复印度支那的和平，满足工人阶级和劳动群众的要求。为了达到这个目的，我们必须加强争取我们和社会党工人的一致行动的运动。
    杜克洛指出了共产党组织工作中的某些缺点。他要求党的干部加强工业企业中的党组织，提高党员的积极性并加强共产党员和劳动群众的联系。他着重指出，共产党的力量和战斗力在于正确地应用列宁的集体领导的组织原则，在于展开批评和自我批评。
    最后，他着重指出，共产党目前最重要的任务是为反对“欧洲防务集团”而斗争。他建议中央委员会就加强党和它所领导的群众的斗争以击败“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者所必须采取的措施问题得出一个明确的观点，以争取一个能够符合法国的利益的政策，一个民族独立与和平的政策。
