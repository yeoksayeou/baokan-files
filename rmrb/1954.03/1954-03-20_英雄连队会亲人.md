    Heroic Company Meets Relatives
    Li Yuerun
    At 9:40 AM on February 22nd, the motorcade of the慰問团 (comfort group) arrived at the gate of the "Second Daigu Company" of the Shandong Provincial Public Security Corps. Huang Songling, Deputy Chief of the National People's Comfort Delegation to the People's Liberation Army, and Chen Wangdao, Deputy Chief of the Fourth Sub-Delegation, led over one hundred and forty representatives off the vehicles. Soldiers embraced the representatives. Veteran soldiers Yu Zhongquan and Liu Guangyu immediately lifted up the volunteer representative, Comrade Li Gang.
    In the "Daigu Company's" courtyard were two birch trees. The慰問 (comfort) meeting was held under the trees. The representatives and soldiers sat on the ground hand in hand, listening quietly to the speech of Deputy Chief Huang Songling. After conveying the deep concern of Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the people of the whole country for the People's Liberation Army, he said: "I hope all comrades of the company will always hold high the banner of heroism and advance!" Li Shiying, Vice Chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, said: "The guard duty you are currently undertaking is as glorious as guarding Daigu." Afterwards, Lu Huanan, the instructor of the Second Daigu Company, expressed his gratitude to the relatives.
    Finally, the comfort delegation presented the Daigu Company with a silk banner embroidered with "Maintain Glory, Carry Forward Glory!" and pinned commemorative medals on eight comrades who had participated in the Daigu Defense War, including Chen Laixi, Liu Fangyu, and Ding Changfa. The soldiers were so excited that tears welled up in their eyes. When Deputy Chief Huang Songling pinned the commemorative medal on Chen Laixi's chest, he said, "You are the most beloved people, the heroes of the people." Chen Laixi shook Deputy Chief Huang's hand and said with emotion, "This is all thanks to the cultivation of the Party and the people. We must work even harder." This moving scene reminded people of the glorious path that this company had taken. It was in the summer of 1947 that the Kuomintang bandit gang concentrated its forces and launched a key offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area. Our army organized counterattacks in the Nanma and Linqu areas. In order to contain the enemy's forces, the Daigu Company received the task of guarding the North and South Daigu and Lugu, known as the "Pillars of Central Shandong." Chiang's bandit 整编 (reorganized) 11th Division, 25th, and 26th Divisions surrounded them. Relying on the favorable terrain, the comrades fought fiercely for many days. Later, when ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements were cut off, they still braved the overwhelming artillery fire and heavy rain, ate wild grass, and used stones to repel countless enemy attacks, like a steel knife inserted into the enemy's heart. After a series of bloody battles for forty-two days, they killed more than 370 enemy soldiers, including the enemy's lieutenant colonel deputy regimental commander and below, and successfully completed the task.
    The comfort meeting ended. The wind grew stronger, and the weather became even colder, but the most enthusiastic scene appeared in the courtyard. The relatives took off all kinds of commemorative medals from their chests and pinned them on the soldiers' clothes; while the soldiers stuffed the prepared candies into the relatives' hands. Li Tianying, a national agricultural labor model, pinned a commemorative medal on the soldier Yang Falu while saying, "Without you, where would our happiness come from!" Yang Falu said, "Without the support of the people, there would be no victory for the People's Liberation Army. I will definitely keep this commemorative medal safe. When I encounter difficulties, I will touch it, and the energy will come, as if relatives are always standing before my eyes." The soldier Ding Kejin expressed his determination to defend socialist construction while stuffing candies into the hands of Zhang Lianxi, a Shanghai industrial labor model.
    After the volunteer cultural troupe, the Shanghai People's Art Theater, and the famous Peking Opera actor Liang Xiaoluan performed many wonderful programs, the relatives were about to leave. The soldiers were reluctant to part, and the relatives were also reluctant to part. The volunteer representatives ran to the cooking squad to bid farewell to the comrades in the cooking squad. At this time, the cooking squad comrades were preparing to cook noodles. When they heard that the relatives were leaving, how could they let them go! Ding Changfa, the cooking squad leader, pulled the representatives and said, "You must eat a bowl of noodles. These noodles were pressed by our own hands, and the machine is a gift from the railway workers. Please eat a bowl of ‘迎亲面 (welcoming relatives noodles)’ before leaving." The volunteer representatives cheered and lifted Ding Changfa up. At this time, the courtyard was boiling again. The soldiers carried the relatives, and the relatives also carried the soldiers, and they sent the representatives to the vehicles in this way.
    The relatives have left, but the soldiers feel that they have not left. The enthusiastic care of the motherland and the people encourages the people's soldiers to move forward forever.

    英雄连队会亲人
    李月润
    二月二十二日九时四十分，慰问团的汽车行列开到了山东省公安总队“第二岱崮连”的门前。全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团副总团长黄松龄、第四总分团副团长陈望道率领着一百四十多位代表一下汽车，战士们便和代表们拥抱起来了，老战士于中泉、刘光玉首先把志愿军代表李纲同志抬了起来。
    “岱崮连”的院子里有两棵白桦树，慰问大会就在树底下举行。代表们和战士们手牵着手地坐在地下，静听黄松龄副总团长的讲话。他传达了毛主席、中央人民政府和全国人民对人民解放军的深切关怀以后说：“希望全连的同志们，永远高举着英雄的旗帜前进！”山东省人民政府副主席李士英说：“你们现在所担任的警卫工作，像守卫岱崮一样的光荣。”接着第二岱崮连指导员路华南向亲人们表达了谢意。
    最后，慰问团将一面绣着“保持光荣，发扬光荣！”的锦旗献给岱崮连，并给参加过岱崮保卫战的老战士陈来禧、刘芳誉、丁长法等八位同志佩上了纪念章。战士们兴奋得眼里泛起了泪花。黄松龄副总团长把纪念章佩在陈来禧胸前的时候说：“你们是最可爱的人，是人民的英雄。”陈来禧握着黄副总团长的手感动地说：“这是全靠党和人民的培养。我们还要加倍努力。”这个动人的情景使人们想起这个连队曾经走过的光荣道路。那是一九四七年的夏天，国民党匪帮集中了兵力向山东解放区实行了重点进攻，我军在南麻、临朐一带组织了反击，为了牵制敌人的兵力，岱崮连接受了扼守号称“鲁中擎天柱”的南北岱崮和芦崮的任务。蒋匪整编第十一师、第二十五、第二十六师将他们团团围住。同志们凭着有利的地形激战多日，后来弹尽援绝，他们仍旧冒着弥天炮火和大雨，吃着野草，用石头击退敌人无数次的攻击，像一把钢刀插在敌人的心脏。先后血战四十二天，击毙敌人的中校副团长以下三百七十余名，胜利完成任务。
    慰问大会结束了。风越刮越大，天气也更加寒冷，但在院子里却出现了最热烈的场面。亲人们把自己胸前的各式各样的纪念章摘下来，挂在战士们的衣襟上；而战士们则把准备好了的糖果，塞在亲人们的手里。全国农业劳动模范李田英一边给战士杨发禄佩纪念章，一边说：“没有你们，哪有俺们的幸福！”杨发禄说：“没有人民的支援也就没有人民解放军的胜利。这个纪念章我一定好好保存起来，遇到困难摸摸它，劲头就来了，就像亲人永远站在我的眼前一样。”战士丁可金一边往上海工业劳动模范张连喜手里塞糖果，一边表示着保卫社会主义建设的决心。
    志愿军文工团、上海人民艺术剧团以及著名京剧演员梁小鸾等演出了许多精彩节目以后，亲人们就要走了。战士们恋恋不舍，亲人们也恋恋不舍。志愿军代表们跑到炊事班向炊事员同志告别。这时，炊事员同志正准备煮面条，听说亲人们要走，怎么肯放！炊事班长丁长法拉着代表们说：“说什么也得吃一碗面条。这面是我们亲手压出来的，而机器是铁路工人的礼品，请亲人们吃碗‘迎亲面’再走。”志愿军代表们欢呼着，把丁长法举了起来。这时，院子里又沸腾了。战士们抬着亲人，亲人们也抬着战士，就这样一直把代表们送上了汽车。
    亲人们走了，但是战士们都觉得他们没有走，祖国和人民的热情关怀鼓舞着人民战士永远向前。
