How to Establish Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Chen Ping Yang Ye

Since agricultural production cooperatives are so beneficial, can we organize all the farmers in the country into agricultural production cooperatives at once? The problem is not that simple. On the one hand, we must actively lead farmers to set up cooperatives, and on the other hand, we must not be too impatient. Joining an agricultural production cooperative will cause considerable changes in farmers' production and lives. Agricultural production cooperatives do have many advantages compared to mutual aid teams and individual households, but they also have many difficulties in setting them up. To set up a cooperative, it must be done well, with sufficient preparation, and only when conditions are ripe. When starting to set it up, it still needs to go through full deliberation and careful discussion.

Be Prepared for the Conditions for Setting Up a Cooperative

What conditions are needed to establish an agricultural production cooperative? The most important are three: first, the masses are truly voluntary; second, there are fair and capable people to be the leading backbone; generally speaking, there must also be a certain foundation of mutual assistance.

Setting up a cooperative requires implementing land shares, unified management, collective labor, and unified division of labor. There are great benefits to doing this, but doing so will change the old habits and old ideas that everyone has had for generations. Changing habits and ideas is not easy. Everyone must truly understand that doing so is indeed good and be determined to take this path so that they can be of one mind after joining the cooperative, and the cooperative can be run well. Therefore, when organizing agricultural production cooperatives, no farmer is forced to participate. Forced participation only harms agricultural production cooperatives and does no good. How do you make the masses voluntary? Only through patient persuasion, using facts to show that individual work is not as good as mutual assistance and cooperation, and that only by organizing can everyone become prosperous together; use the real people and real things of the already well-run cooperatives to show everyone that cooperatives can indeed produce more grain and increase income, and that the various methods of the cooperative are truly reasonable. However, you cannot say "not participating in the cooperative is taking the dark road, is taking the capitalist road," that is tantamount to using "big labels" to pressure people; although on the surface it can make many people say they are willing to join the cooperative, in fact, they may not be truly voluntary in their hearts; if they are not truly voluntary, they will be half-hearted after joining the cooperative, and it will still not benefit the cooperative.

Many families' land, a lot of labor, a lot of livestock, farm tools, and funds are used together; and the income and distribution of a lot of grain and money must be done in an organized manner, which is also not easy. To do these things well, on the one hand, it depends on everyone's unity, and on the other hand, it also requires fair, capable, and active leading backbones, that is, leaders. The leading backbone should be cultivated and educated by the county and district leaders, but also by their own efforts to learn, and also by the masses' constant support, encouragement, and supervision. The leading backbone should be produced from the masses and truly supported by the masses. To run the cooperative well, one or two leaders are not enough, but also some activists who are generally fair and capable, closely united around the leaders, and able to closely connect with the masses of the whole cooperative.

The masses' determination to voluntarily engage in collective management and the habit of collective labor, and the backbone leading collective production, where do these conditions come from? It takes a considerable period of active effort to create them, and it is impossible to "blitz" these conditions out temporarily. Generally speaking, it should be produced from mutual aid teams. With one or several good mutual aid teams as the foundation, it is easier to set up an agricultural production cooperative, and it will be easier to consolidate. Of course, this condition is not absolute. If the local leading cadres are strong, the masses' political awareness and cultural level are high, and there are certain leading backbones; especially in places where agricultural production cooperatives have already been set up quite a lot and are run quite well, it is possible to set up cooperatives directly without going through a long period of mutual assistance or without going through mutual assistance at all.

A Full Ideological Mobilization is Necessary

When the peasant masses begin to join the cooperative, they often have many ideological concerns. Therefore, the process of establishing an agricultural production cooperative is a process of intense struggle between new and old ideas in the minds of the joining farmers. Even if they have already said they are willing to join the cooperative, they will still have many concerns when they really want to join. Some people are very enthusiastic when talking about cooperatives, but their determination to join may not be great. Enthusiasm and determination are two different things. Some people have figured it out themselves, but their family members may not have figured it out. Some people have figured it out on this matter, but they may not have figured it out on another matter. Even if the condition of mass voluntariness is generally available, it cannot be assumed that there are no more ideological problems among the masses.

Of course, it is difficult for everyone to fully understand the great truth of taking the socialist road; saying that it is necessary to "understand" it cannot be overly demanding. To fully understand, it is necessary to continuously receive education from the facts after joining the cooperative. The "understanding" mentioned here mainly means understanding the following things:

1. The current agricultural production cooperative is of a semi-socialist nature. Land shares are not the same as land collectivization. Land ownership still belongs to private individuals, and land is still entitled to a certain income based on quantity, quality, and distance. Not paying dividends on land is something that can only be done after production has greatly increased and after everyone has had a democratic discussion and is completely voluntary. Livestock and farm tools must also be rewarded for joining the cooperative, and how to join, how to use, and how to get rewards must be determined through democratic discussion. After livestock and farm tools join the cooperative, the members can still use them for personal use.

2. Agricultural production cooperatives implement a certain method of distribution according to work, and people with more labor and more active labor will not suffer losses. The cooperative can reasonably divide labor, and people with weak labor also have suitable work to do and can also get a certain reward.

3. The purpose of setting up a cooperative is to increase production, increase income, and make everyone prosperous. As long as everyone works together, they will never produce less grain.

4. Farmers' joining the cooperative is completely voluntary, and leaving the cooperative is also completely free, and there is no coercion.

5. The rules and systems of the cooperative are all for running the cooperative well, and they are all to be determined by everyone through democratic discussion, and they are reasonable. It is impossible to do without rules; having rules is not to make everyone lose the freedom of personal activities.

6. Agricultural production cooperatives do have many great benefits, but setting up a cooperative does have certain difficulties; it is necessary to be determined, work together, and constantly fight against difficulties, and not be discouraged after encountering difficulties after setting up the cooperative.

To understand these things ideologically, there are several ways:

1. Visit nearby cooperatives that have already been set up well; or invite cadres and members of cooperatives that have already been set up well to make reports.

2. Calculate in advance the accounts of how the cooperative may increase production, and then calculate the accounts for several typical households (such as households with more labor and less land, households with more land and less labor, etc.) to show that everyone will not suffer losses after joining the cooperative, and that as long as they all work hard, they can all increase their income.

3. Each family should hold a family meeting to generally clarify the ideas of everyone, young and old, male and female. In particular, older people and women have many special ideological concerns; cadres and activists who have already clarified their ideas should deeply understand the specific ideas of those who have not yet clarified their ideas, and use the method of "one key opens one lock" to ensure that the families joining the cooperative are generally all voluntary.

Some Specific Issues Should Be Properly Resolved

After everyone has made up their minds to join the cooperative, there are still many specific issues to be carefully and thoroughly discussed and resolved when they are about to join. After the question of "joining or not" is generally resolved, the next question is "how to join." On the issue of "how to join," there are generally the following things:

1. How much land to join, how much private plot to keep. It is not good to keep too much private plot, it will make oneself "treading on two boats" after joining the cooperative, and one will have to spend a lot of effort for the private plot, and one cannot participate well in the labor of the cooperative. In this way, it is not only bad for the cooperative, but in the end, one will still suffer losses. It is also not good for each family to not keep any land at all, as it will make it inconvenient to eat vegetables, and family members will have opinions, which will also make the cooperative unstable. How much is appropriate to keep as a private plot can be determined by each cooperative through democratic discussion based on specific conditions.

2. How to distribute dividends on land, how to evaluate production. Whether land is distributed according to proportion or fixed remuneration, and how large the dividend ratio is, must be carefully discussed to ensure that those with more land and those with more labor do not suffer losses. Everyone can easily have opinions when evaluating production, and it is necessary to evaluate fairly. You can first select several different plots of land as standards, and after democratic evaluation by everyone, evaluate the standard annual output; then each member will self-report the annual output of their own land based on the standard, and the evaluation committee elected by everyone will review it; then discuss in groups and compare each other; finally, the members' congress will pass it. At this time, there will inevitably be some individuals who have opinions; if it is indeed evaluated incorrectly, it can be corrected with everyone's consent; if it is not wrong, patiently explain it to them clearly by comparing the facts.

3. How to use livestock, farm tools, and vehicles, and how to get remuneration. The evaluation method is roughly the same as land.

4. How to use seeds, fertilizers, and other production investments; what to do with the crops already growing in the ground when joining the cooperative. These things must be decided after democratic discussion.

5. How to calculate labor days; how to distribute sideline income; how to accumulate public welfare funds and public accumulation funds. These must also be discussed roughly when joining the cooperative to come up with a standard.

6. Whether the members are satisfied with each other. It is necessary to conduct a review of each person joining the cooperative by all members in a democratic manner.

Carefully Formulate the Articles of Association and Systems

In the process of building the cooperative, it is necessary to formulate the articles of association of the cooperative and necessary systems through democratic discussion. In this way, it will be good to act according to the regulations. The process of generating the articles of association can be to discuss the articles of association first and then solve specific problems according to the articles of association, or to combine solving specific problems with discussing the articles of association. The articles of association are not to be revised much for a relatively long period of time and are the "fundamental law" of the cooperative. Special attention and caution must be taken when formulating them. What is not easy to stipulate in detail in the articles of association, such as how to use livestock and farm tools, what rules to follow when working, etc., can also be stipulated separately in the system. The system must also be followed once it is formulated, not for show, and it must not be sloppy when formulating it; it is better to keep it simple at first, and it must be practical and feasible, and then it can be gradually supplemented and revised in the process of implementation. It is impossible to make it perfect all at once when everyone has very little practical experience.

The articles of association of the cooperative should generally stipulate the following items: what is the nature of the agricultural production cooperative we want to run, what is the purpose of running the cooperative, what is the management policy, what should be the relationship with the state-owned economy and other cooperative economies (supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, etc.), what should be the relationship with mutual aid teams and individual households, who can join the cooperative, what rights and obligations do the members have, the method of joining the cooperative, the method of obtaining remuneration for land, draught animals, farm tools, etc., the principle of distributing income, the principle of calculating labor days, the principle of managing finances, the principle of accumulating public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, what is the organizational structure of the cooperative, how are the cadres in the cooperative produced, how are the powers and responsibilities divided, how to reward and punish members, etc. Most of these things have been discussed by everyone during the preparation for the establishment of the cooperative. Now that it is formulated into formal articles of association, it can further unify and clarify everyone's thinking. In the process of formulating the articles of association, everyone will further receive education in collectivism.

There is also an item to be stipulated in the articles of association of the cooperative, which is the name of the cooperative. The name of the cooperative should preferably choose words that all members understand and love, such as "Progress," "Bumper Harvest," "May 1st," "Light," and so on. If there is only one cooperative in the whole village and it is impossible to set up more than two cooperatives in the future, it is also possible to use the village name as the name of the cooperative. In some places, it is named the first and second agricultural production cooperatives of a certain village, which is also feasible as long as the masses are willing. It is not good for some cooperatives to use the name of the director (chairman) of the cooperative as the name of the cooperative. The director (chairman) is to be elected once every certain period; using a person's name as the name of the cooperative can easily hinder the implementation of the democratic election system. Using a person's name as the name of the cooperative generally also easily causes dissatisfaction among other backbone members and ordinary members of the cooperative. Therefore, except for some nationally famous labor models who have indeed made contributions to the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic bumper harvest movement and are sincerely supported by the masses, and their names can be used as the name of the cooperative, in general, it is best not to use a person's name as the name of the cooperative. (In some places, the names of certain memorable figures, such as the anti-American and aid-Korea heroes Huang Jiguang and Qiu Shaoyun, are used as the name of the cooperative, which is possible.)

Establish Organizational Structures Democratically

After the articles of association of the cooperative are formulated, the organizational structure of the cooperative can be formally established in a democratic election manner according to the provisions of the articles of association. Generally speaking, the first step is to convene a members' congress or members' representative congress to elect the management committee and the supervisory committee; the management committee then elects the director (chairman); under the leadership of the management committee, reasonably divide the labor force of the whole cooperative into several production teams (or groups), and each team (or group) then democratically elects the team (group) leader.

The process of election and organization is also a good education for both the backbone members and the masses of members. The backbone members can further understand what kind of people are supported by the masses and how they should continue to work hard; the masses of members can further understand that running the cooperative does require every member to do their best and run it conscientiously, and further learn to manage the affairs of the cooperative democratically and centrally.

Once the leadership structure is established and the production organization is formed, we can immediately turn to discussing the production plan; then mobilize the whole cooperative, put it into production, and strive for a bumper harvest with all our strength.

Throughout the entire process of building the cooperative, attention must be paid to doing a good job in production at the same time. On the one hand, we must strive not to delay production time, and on the other hand, we must dispel the confused idea of each member that they are unwilling to do a good job in their own production because they are going to build a cooperative.

Rural Grassroots Organizations Must Take Responsibility

The process of building the cooperative is not only a process of gradual improvement of the ideological level of the masses, but also a process of gradual improvement of the leadership ability of rural cadres. At the same time, the work of building the cooperative cannot be separated from the leadership of the Party's rural branch. County and district cadres should not set aside the Party's grassroots organizations when entering villages to build cooperatives; the Party's rural grassroots organizations should also take the initiative and bravely shoulder the responsibilities they should bear. If this is not done, the county and district cadres will not be able to understand the specific situation well, and the work of building the cooperative will not proceed smoothly; even if the cooperative is built, and the cadres sent by the higher authorities to build the cooperative are transferred to other places, the Party's grassroots organizations do not yet have the ability to run the cooperative, and the cooperative will still not be run well. Naturally, all places where it has been decided to build a cooperative already have a certain leading backbone. However, having a backbone does not mean that these backbones have learned all the ways to run a cooperative. Before building the cooperative, during the process of building the cooperative, and after the completion of building the cooperative, we should continue to pay attention to training, cultivating, and exercising the backbone members, and improving their political awareness and working ability. The backbone members themselves should also study hard, work actively under the leadership and help of the Party's grassroots organizations, closely connect with the masses, and do their best to run the affairs of the cooperative well, and not fail the love and hope of the masses.

    怎样建立农业生产合作社
    陈平　　杨叶
    农业生产合作社的好处既然那么多，可以不可以把全国农民一下都组织到农业生产合作社里呢？问题不那么简单。我们一方面要积极领导农民办社，另一方面也不能太性急。要知道，参加农业生产合作社，在农民生产上和生活上都要引起相当大的变化。农业生产合作社比起互助组和单干户来确实有很多好处，可是办起来也确实有很多困难。要办社，一定要办好，有足够的准备，条件成熟了才能办；着手办的时候也还需要经过充分的酝酿、细细地讨论。
      要准备好办社的条件
    成立农业生产合作社需要有些什么条件呢？最要紧的有三条：一是群众真正自愿；一是有公道能干的人做领导骨干；一般地说，还要有一定的互助基础。
    办社要实行土地入股、统一经营，要实行集体劳动、统一分工。这样做好处很大，可是这样做就要改变大家多少辈子以来的老习惯、旧思想。改变习惯和思想，那可不是很容易的事。要大家都真正懂得这样做确实好，下定决心要走这条路，入社以后才能齐心，社才能办好。因此，组织农业生产合作社的时候，决不强迫任何一个农民参加。强迫参加，对于农业生产合作社只有坏处，没有一点好处。怎样使群众都自愿呢？只能用耐心说服的办法，用事实说明单干不如互助合作，只有组织起来才能大家共同富裕；用已经办好的合作社的真人真事给大家看，使大家看到合作社真能多打粮食、增加收入，而且社里的各种办法真正合情合理。可是，也不能说“不参加合作社就是走黑暗道路，就是走资本主义道路”，那样说就等于用“大帽子”压人；那样虽然表面上看也能叫许多人说他愿意入社，其实他心里还是不一定真正自愿；不真正自愿，入社以后就会三心二意，对社也还是没有好处。
    许多家的土地，很多的劳动力，很多的牲口、农具和资金，都在一起使用；很多粮食钱财的收入和分配都要弄得有条有理，这也不是很容易的事。要把这些事办好，一方面要靠大家齐心，另方面也要有公正、能干、积极的领导骨干，也就是带头人。领导骨干要靠县区领导方面培养教育，也靠他们自己努力学习，还靠群众经常支持、鼓励和监督。领导骨干应当是从群众中产生出来的，是群众真正拥护的。要把社办好，只有一个两个带头人还不行，还要有一些大体上也公正能干的积极分子，紧紧地团结在带头人周围，并且能紧紧地联系全社群众。
    群众自愿集体经营的决心和集体劳动的习惯，领导集体生产的骨干，这些条件从哪里产生出来呢？要经过相当长时期的积极努力才能创造出来，而不可能临时“突击”一下就把这些条件“制造”出来。一般地说，要从互助组里产生出来。有一个或者几个好的互助组做底子，农业生产合作社就比较好办了，办起来也会容易巩固。当然，这个条件也不是绝对的。如果当地领导干部强，群众的政治觉悟和文化水平高，有了一定的领导骨干；特别是在农业生产合作社已经办得相当多又办得相当好的地方，不经过较长时期的互助或者完全不经过互助而直接办社也是可能的。
      要经过充分的思想动员
    农民群众开始入社的时候，往往有许多思想顾虑。因此，建立农业生产合作社的过程，就是入社农民的新思想和旧思想在自己的心里进行激烈斗争的过程。即使已经说出自愿入社了，到真要入社的时候，还是会有很多顾虑的。有些人说起合作社来情绪很高，可是入社的决心不一定就大。情绪和决心，还是两回事。有的人自己的思想弄通了，家里的人的思想还不一定通。有的人在这件事情上思想通了，在另一件事情上思想还不一定通。即使一般地说已经有了群众自愿的条件，也不能认为群众思想上已经没有什么问题了。
    当然，要每个人都把走社会主义道路的大道理完全弄通，是困难的；说要“弄通”，也不能过高要求。要完全弄通，还需要在入社以后从事实中不断地得到教育。这里所说的“弄通”，主要是说要了解这样一些事情：
    一、眼前的农业生产合作社是半社会主义性质的，土地入股并不是土地归公，土地所有权还是属于私人的，土地还要按多少、好坏、远近分得一定的收益。土地不分红，是要在生产大大增加了以后，经过大家民主讨论，各家各户完全自愿了才能那么办的。牲口、农具入社也要得一定的报酬，而且怎样入社，怎样使用，怎样得报酬，都要经过大家民主讨论才能确定。牲口、农具入了社，社员个人要使用时，也还是可以用的。
    二、农业生产合作社是实行一定的按劳分红的办法的，劳力多、劳动积极的人不会吃亏。社里能合理分工，劳动力弱的人也有合适的活干，也能得到一定的报酬。
    三、办社的目的就是为了提高生产、增加收入、大家富裕。只要大家齐心干，就决不会少打粮食。
    四、农民入社是完全自愿的，要出社也完全自由，决不强迫。
    五、社里的规矩、制度都是为了把社办好，而且都是要由大家民主讨论定出来的，是合情合理的。没有规矩是不行的；有了规距也不是要把大家弄得没有个人活动的自由。
    六、农业生产合作社确实有很多很大的好处，可是办社也确实有一定的困难；要下定决心，齐心合力，不断和困难作斗争，不要办起社来以后碰到困难又灰心泄气。
    要把这些事情都在思想上弄通，有这样几个办法：
    一、到附近已经办好的合作社去参观、访问；或者请已经办好的合作社的干部、社员来作报告。
    二、预先大体上算一算合作社可能增加生产的账，再给几个典型户（像劳力多土地少的户、土地多劳力少的户等等）算一算账，说明大家入社以后确实都不吃亏，只要都好好干，就都能增加收入。
    三、各家要开一开家庭会，把男女老少每一个人的思想都大体上打通。特别是老年人和妇女，有不少特殊的思想顾虑；干部和积极分子的思想已经弄通了的人，应当深入地了解思想还没有弄通的人的具体思想，用“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，做到入社的各家各户大体上都是全家自愿。
      要妥当地解决一些具体问题
    大家下定了入社的决心以后，到要入社的时候，还是有很多具体问题要细致地周到地讨论解决的。“入不入”的问题大体上解决了，接着来的就是“怎样入”的问题。在“怎样入”的问题上，一般地说有这样几件事情：
    一、入社地多少，自留地多少。自留地太多是不好的，会弄得自己入社以后还是“脚踏两只船”，为了自留地要费很多心，不能好好参加社里的劳动。这样，不但对社不好，到头来也还是自己吃亏。各家完全不留一点地也不好，那样弄得吃菜不方便，家里人有意见，反而也会使社不巩固。究竟自留多少合适，各社都可以看具体条件经过民主讨论以后确定。
    二、土地怎样分红，怎样评产。土地是按比例分红还是固定报酬，分红比例大小，都要仔细讨论，要使土地多的和劳力多的都不吃亏。评产量的时候大家也很容易闹意见，要评得确实公平。可以先挑选几块不同的地做标准，经大家民主评议，评出标准常年产量来；然后每个社员根据标准自报自己的地的常年产量，由大家选举出来的评议委员会审查；然后分组讨论，互相对比；最后由社员大会通过。这时候，不免还有个别人有意见；如果确实评错了，经过大家同意可以改正；如果并不错，要耐心地用事实对比向他们解释清楚。
    三、牲口、农具、车辆怎样使用，怎样得报酬。评议的办法和土地大体上相同。
    四、种籽、肥料和别的生产投资怎样使用；入社的时候已经长在地里的庄稼怎么办。这些事情都要经过民主讨论然后决定。
    五、劳动日怎样计算；副业收入怎样分配；公积金公益金怎样积累。这些也是要在入社的时候就大体上讨论出个标准来的。
    六、社员相互之间是不是满意。要经过民主的方式，由全体社员对每个入社的人进行审查。
      要慎重地制订章程和制度
    在建社过程中，一定要经过民主讨论订出社的章程和必要的制度。这样以后就好照章办事。章程产生的过程，可以是先讨论章程然后根据章程解决具体问题，也可以把解决具体问题和讨论章程结合起来进行。章程是要比较长的时期不大修改的，是社里的“根本法律”，制订的时候要特别认真、慎重。章程里边不好详细规定的，像牲口农具怎样使用、做活的时候要遵守些什么规矩等等，还可以另外定出制度来。制度也是定出来就要照办的，不是为了摆样子，制订的时候也不可马虎；最初宁可定得简单一些，要切实可行，然后在实行的过程中，可以渐渐地补充修改。在大家都还很少实际经验的时候，一下子要定得十全十美是不可能的。
    社的章程大体上要规定这样一些项目：我们要办的农业生产合作社是什么性质，办社的目的是什么，经营方针是什么，和国营经济、别的合作经济
  （供销合作社、信用合作社等）应当是怎么样的关系，和互助组、单干户应当是怎么样的关系，什么人能入社，社员有什么权利和义务，入社的办法，土地耕畜农具等取得报酬的办法，分配收益的原则，计算劳动日的原则，管理财务的原则，积累公积金和公益金的原则，社的组织机构是什么样子，社内干部怎样产生、职权怎样划分，怎样奖励和处分社员等等。这些事大部分都是在酝酿建社的时候大家都讨论过的。现在制订成正式的章程，就可以更进一步使大家的思想统一起来，明确起来。在制订章程的过程中，大家也就进一步受到了集体主义的教育。
    社的章程里边还有一项要规定的，就是社的名称。社的名称最好是选择全体社员懂得它的意思而且喜爱的字样，像“前进”“连丰”“五一”“光明”等等。有的全村只有一个社，今后也不可能办两个以上的社，用村名作社名，也是可以的。有的地方以某村第一、第二农业生产合作社命名，只要群众愿意，也是可行的。有些社用社长（主任）的名字做社的名称，是不好的。社长（主任）是要隔一定时期选举一次的；用一个人的名字作为社名，很容易妨碍民主选举制度的执行。用一个人的名字作为社名，一般地说也容易引起社内别的骨干分子和一般社员不满。因此，除了全国著名的一些劳动模范，他们在互助合作运动、爱国丰产运动中确实有功劳，为群众真心拥护，可用他们的名字做为社名以外，一般地说，最好不要用一个人的名字做为社的名称。（有的地方为纪念某些值得纪念的人物，像抗美援朝英雄黄继光、邱少云等，以他们的名字作为社名，那是可以的。）
      要民主地建立组织机构
    社的章程制订出来以后，就可以按照章程的规定，用民主选举的方式，正式建立社的组织机构。一般地说，就是先开社员大会或社员代表大会，选举出管理委员会、监察委员会；管理委员会再推举社长（主任）；在管理委员会领导下，合理地把全社的劳动力分成若干个生产队（或组），每个队
  （或组）再民主选举出队（组）长。
    选举和组织的过程，对骨干分子和社员群众也都是很好的教育。骨干分子可以从这中间进一步了解群众拥护的是什么样的人，自己应该怎样继续努力；社员群众也可以进一步了解办社确实是要每个社员都尽心地认真地来办的，进一步学习用民主集中的方式管理社里的大事情。
    领导机构建立起来了，生产组织编制起来了，就可以立即转入讨论生产计划；然后全社动员起来，投入生产，浑身是劲地争取大丰收。
    在建社的全部过程中间，都要注意同时搞好生产。一方面要力求不耽误生产时间，另方面要打消每个社员因为要办社了就不愿搞好自己的生产的糊涂思想。
    农村基层组织要负起责任来
    建社的过程不但是群众思想水平逐渐提高的过程，也是农村干部领导能力逐渐提高的过程。同时，建社工作离开党的农村支部的领导，也是不行的。县、区干部入村建社，不应该撇开党的基层组织；农村党的基层组织也应当主动地勇敢地担负起自己应当担负的责任。不这样做，县区干部就不能很好地了解具体情况，建社工作就不能顺利进行；即使把社建成了，上级把建社时派来的干部调到别的地方去了，党的基层组织却还没有办社的能力，社还是办不好。自然，凡是已经决定建社的地方，都是已经有了一定的领导骨干的。不过，有了骨干，并不等于这些骨干已经学会了办社的一切办法。在建社以前，建社过程中，建社完成以后，都应当继续不断地注意训练、培养、锻炼骨干分子，提高他们的政治觉悟和工作能力。骨干分子自己也要努力学习，在党的基层组织领导和帮助下，积极工作，紧密地联系群众，尽心尽力把社里的事办好，不要辜负群众的爱戴和希望。
