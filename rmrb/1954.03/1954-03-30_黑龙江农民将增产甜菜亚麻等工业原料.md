Heilongjiang farmers, while striving to increase grain production this year, will also work hard to increase the production of various industrial raw materials. The planting area of industrial raw material crops in the province will reach more than 100,000 hectares (15 mu per hectare) this year. Sugar beet production is required to increase by more than 176,800 tons compared to last year, and flax production is required to increase by more than 5,700 tons compared to last year.

The positive production of Heilongjiang farmers has supported national industrial construction, especially the development of local state-owned industries in the province. The Hongguang Sugar Factory, which was built and put into production in the province in 1953, relies entirely on sugar beets produced in Nehe, Nenjiang, Yian and other counties in the province. The raw materials used by the larger Anda Oil Factory are soybeans produced by farmers in the province. Potatoes and reeds produced in Heilongjiang Province supply the needs of starch factories and paper mills in the province. These local state-owned factories have expanded their production due to the increasing supply of raw materials from agriculture. Because of the increase in sugar beet production, Heilongjiang Province is preparing to build another sugar factory this year.

    黑龙江农民将增产甜菜亚麻等工业原料
    黑龙江省农民今年在争取粮食增产的同时，还要努力增产多种工 业原料。全省工业原料作物的种植面积今年要达到十万多垧（每垧十五市亩）。甜菜产量要求比去年增加十七万六千八百多吨，亚麻产量要求比去年增加五千七百多吨。
    黑龙江省农民积极生产的结果，支援了国家工业建设，特别是直接支援了本省地方国营工业的发展。该省一九五三年建成并已开工生产的红光糖厂，全部原料是依靠本省讷河、嫩江、依安等县出产的甜菜。规模较大的安达制油厂用的原料，就是本省农民生产的大豆。黑龙江省出产的马铃薯和苇子，供应了本省淀粉厂和造纸厂的需要。这些地方国营工厂由于从农业方面得到日益增多的原料，生产都有了扩大。因为甜菜产量增加，黑龙江省准备今年再筹建一处糖厂。
