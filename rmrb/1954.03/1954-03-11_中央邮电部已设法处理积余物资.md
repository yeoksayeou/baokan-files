    The Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Has Taken Steps to Handle Surplus Materials

    A letter from the Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications: The "Reader's Letters Summary" column on January 29th published a letter titled "Serious Situation of Overstocked Materials in the Postal and Telecommunications System," which is a completely accurate criticism. There are many reasons for the overstocking of materials in various regions of our ministry. For example, the supply management work of the postal and telecommunications system was excessively centralized in the past, and subordinate units had no authority to dispose of surplus materials. However, our ministry failed to accurately grasp the inventory situation in various regions and did not understand the specifications, formats, and condition of some materials. In addition, we took over a large amount of special postal and telecommunications equipment during the liberation, with limited annual usage, making it impossible to sell on the market, so it could only be listed as excess reserves. However, the main reason is that we lacked a strong sense of political responsibility and failed to actively and proactively find ways to utilize the large amount of surplus inventory, especially the materials and clearing materials held in custody by various regions on behalf of the ministry, for which no one was responsible for a long time. To this end, our ministry has convened a national supply work conference to discuss the handling and utilization of surplus materials.
    Regarding the carrier machines overstocked by the Jiangsu Postal and Telecommunications Administration, three units have been transferred this year; our ministry has also included the repair work of the carrier machines in the bureau's inventory into this year's work plan. In addition to the 1,340 magneto and automatic telephone sets that have been transferred out in the first quarter of this year, the remaining sets will also be transferred out successively within the year. As for the overstocked cables, most of them are scattered and short, and can only be used for maintenance; however, because the maintenance usage is not large, and our ministry has not well grasped the inventory and has not thought of fundamental solutions in terms of design, the material overstocking time has been prolonged. More than 25,000 meters of cable will be transferred out of the bureau this year, and the remaining part is being studied for disposal.

### 中央邮电部已设法处理积余物资

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央邮电部已设法处理积余物资
    中央人民政府邮电部来信：一月二十九日“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了“邮电系统积压物资情况严重”的来信，这一批评是完全正确的。我部各地库存物资所以造成积压的原因很多，如过去一个时期邮电系统的供应管理工作过分集中，附属单位无权处理积余物资。而我部却未能确实掌握各地库存物资情况，对各地有些物资的规格、程式及物资新旧程度也不了解。再加上解放时接管了大量邮电专用器材，每年用量有限，在市场却无法销售，只有列作超额储备。但是主要的原因却是我们政治责任心不强，对库存大量积余物资未能积极而主动地设法利用，尤其是各地代部保管料及清料，很长一个时期无人负责。为此，我部已召开过全国供应工作会议，讨论有关积余物资的处理和利用问题。
    关于江苏邮电管理局积压的载波机，今年已调出三部；我部并将该局库存载波机的整修工作，列入本年度的工作计划。其余磁石及自动话机，除今年第一季度已调出一千三百四十部外，年内亦将陆续调用。至于库存电缆多为零星短小之料，只能作维护使用；但是因为维护用量不大，同时我部未能很好掌握库存，没有从设计上想根本办法，更拖长了物资积压时间。今年即将从该局平衡调出二万五千余公尺电缆，余下部分正在研究处理中。
