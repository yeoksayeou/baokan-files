The peasants in the Fourteenth District of Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, after receiving education on the General Line, have seen many mutual aid teams requesting to transition into cooperatives. The old cooperatives in the district have expanded, and nine new cooperatives have been established. There are plans to establish three more cooperatives, and the general mutual aid teams have also been rectified and improved. However, in the process of establishing cooperatives, some mutual aid teams are highly enthusiastic but have not carefully considered the conditions for transitioning. Some members of the teams have expressed that if they cannot transition into cooperatives due to unmet conditions, they will not even participate in mutual aid teams anymore. Some core members of the teams believe that cooperatives are easy to manage and "honorable," while mutual aid teams are difficult to manage and not "honorable." Some mutual aid team members have the idea of simply relying on government assistance. For example, Wang Huanting, a member of the Renhe Village mutual aid team, said: "When we start a cooperative, it doesn't matter what we lack, the government can provide loans." In short, some members of mutual aid teams do not yet understand the conditions for transitioning to cooperatives, have a mentality of valuing cooperatives over mutual aid teams, and if their request to transition to cooperatives is not approved, it will affect production.

In order to overcome this mentality of valuing cooperatives over mutual aid teams among some mutual aid team members and promote their rapid spring plowing and production, the CCP Jiaohe County Fourteenth District Committee recently held a special symposium for core members of these mutual aid teams. At the meeting, the specific path of socialist transformation of agriculture was first explained, pointing out that mutual aid teams are already the bud of socialism, and by doing a good job in mutual aid production, we can take a further step towards socialism. The meeting also used the example of Wu Shaoying's team in Shuangfeng Village of the county, which forcibly transitioned to a cooperative without meeting the conditions, taking a detour, to illustrate that there must be certain conditions for transitioning to a cooperative. The meeting also criticized some erroneous understandings of the transition to cooperatives. After this education, their impatience gradually subsided. Xiang Yongyi, the leader of a mutual aid team in Erlong Village, said: "In the past, our team planned to work independently if our request to transition to a cooperative was not approved, which was wrong. If we did that, we would have no hope of establishing a cooperative in 1955." At this meeting, in addition to conducting general policy education, the District Committee also guided everyone to fully discuss some methods for doing a good job in the production of year-round teams and creating conditions for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest: 1. Do a good job in year-round production and management, ensure that the year-round teams are well managed, and frequently organize core members to visit production cooperatives to learn cooperative management experience; 2. Cultivate core members in mutual aid teams, improve the management committee, give full play to collective leadership, and immediately train bookkeepers; 3. Implement a contract labor system to do a good job in the production of mutual aid teams, accumulate experience, and strive to accumulate a portion of public accumulation funds; 4. Strengthen political education, study mutual aid and cooperation policies, and lay the ideological foundation for running cooperatives; 5. The village branches should strengthen their leadership over these mutual aid teams and do their best to help them. After this symposium, the core members of each team were in high spirits and expressed their determination to manage the mutual aid teams well and strive to transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Now these core members are leading the members of each team to actively collect firewood and deliver manure in preparation for spring plowing and production.

    中共吉林蛟河县十四区区委召开互助骨干座谈会
    要求办好互助组为秋后建社创造条件
    吉林省蛟河县十四区农民在受到总路线教育以后，许多互助组都要求转社。该区老社已经扩大，并已建立九个新社，还准备再建立三个社，对一般互助组也进行了整顿和提高。但是，在建社中，有些互助组热情很高，对转社条件没有很好考虑，就要求转社。有的组的组员表示，如因条件不具备不能转社时，就连互助组也不参加了；有的组的骨干分子认为社好搞，还“光荣”，组不好搞，还不“光荣”。有的互助组员则存在单纯依靠政府帮助的思想，如仁和村互助组组员王焕亭说：“搞起社，缺啥也不要紧，政府能贷款。”总之，有一部分互助组的组员对转社条件还不了解，有重社轻组思想，不批准转社，就要影响生产。
    中共蛟河县十四区区委为了克服这一部分互助组员重社轻组的思想，推动他们迅速进行春耕生产，于最近特别召开了这部分互助组的骨干分子座谈会。会上首先讲清了对农业实行社会主义改造的具体道路，指出互助组已经是社会主义的萌芽，作好互助生产，就能向社会主义再进一步。会上并用该县双凤村武绍英组不够条件硬转社，走了弯路的事例，说明转社必须要有一定的条件。会上还批评了对转社的一些错误认识。经过这样教育以后，他们的急躁情绪逐渐克服了，二龙村一个互助组组长项永伊说：“过去我们组打算不批准转社就单干，是不对的，那样一来，到一九五五年也没有希望建社。”区委在这个会上，除了进行一般的政策教育外，还引导大家充分讨论了搞好常年组的生产、给秋后建社创造条件的一些办法：一、做好全年生产和经营管理工作，保证把常年组搞好，并经常组织骨干到生产合作社参观，学习办社经验；二、在互助组中培养骨干，健全管理委员会，发挥集体领导作用，并即培养记帐员；三、实行包工制，以搞好互助组的生产，积累经验，并争取积累一部分公积金；四、加强政治教育，学习互助合作政策，打下办社的思想基础；五、各村支部加强对这些互助组的领导，尽力帮助他们。各组骨干分子经过这次座谈，情绪都很高，表示一定办好互助组，争取秋后转社。现在这些骨干正带领各组组员积极打柴、送粪，准备春耕生产。　（蛟河县十四区区委会）
