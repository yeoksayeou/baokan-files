Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency on March 3rd, on February 20th, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an attack on enemy troops in Xianghua County, Guangzhi Province, central Vietnam, and liberated this county with a population of 70,000.

At the same time, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces also forced the enemy to withdraw from seven strongholds on Highway 9 connecting Donghe and Liaobao in the Guangping, Guangzhi, and Chengtian areas, seizing 300 rifles and 20 tons of ammunition and military equipment. In addition, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces attacked the enemy stronghold Xuan Cang on February 8th, killing many enemies and seizing 25 enemy rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Vietnam News Agency commentator Zheng Yi published an article on the 3rd, commenting on the recent victory of the Lao People's Liberation Army in basically liberating Phongsaly Province. The commentary stated that Phongsaly Province is a large province in northern Laos, with an area of 16,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 70,000. Phongsaly, Lai Chau in northwestern Vietnam, and Dien Bien Phu are three important strategic strongholds, forming a triangular alignment. In the past, the enemy used Phongsaly as a springboard to attack Lai Chau, Son La, and other areas in northwestern Vietnam. Last December, the enemy was driven out of Lai Chau by the Vietnamese People's Army, and recently the enemy lost Phongsaly again. Currently, Dien Bien Phu has become a more isolated enemy stronghold in the middle of the vast liberated areas of Vietnam and Laos.

The commentary stated that the vast areas of Laos bordering the provinces of Lai Chau, Son La, and Hoa Binh in North Vietnam, and Qinghua, Yian, Hatinh, Guangping, Guangzhi, Guangnan, and Guangyi in Central Vietnam have been successively liberated by the Lao People's Liberation Army.

The commentary concluded by pointing out that after the Lao People's Liberation Army achieved brilliant victories in the winter and spring campaigns, it achieved another victory in Phongsaly, which is a great encouragement to the struggle of the people of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam for national independence and world peace.

    越南人民军解放中越香化县
   【新华社四日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：二月二十日，越南人民军对中越广治省香化县的敌军发动进攻，并解放了这个拥有七万人口的县份。
    同时，越南人民武装并在广平、广治、承天地区迫使敌军自连接东河和辽保的第九号公路上的七个据点撤退，缴获步枪三百支和军火、军事装备二十吨。另外，越南人民武装在二月八日进攻敌军据点玄苍，毙敌多名，缴获敌军步枪二十五支。
    【新华社四日讯】越南通讯社评论员政义在三日发表文章，评论寮国人民解放军最近基本解放封萨里省的胜利。评论说，封萨里省是寮国北部的一个大省份，面积一万六千平方公里，人口约七万。封萨里与越南西北部的莱州和奠边府是三个重要的战略据点，形成了犄角之势。在过去，敌人利用封萨里作为进攻越南西北部的莱州、山萝和其他地区的跳板。去年十二月，敌人被越南人民军赶出了莱州，最近敌人又失掉了封萨里。目前，奠边府就成为广大的越南和寮国解放区中间的一个更加孤立的敌军据点。
    评论说，目前，和北越的莱州、山萝、和平以及中越的清化、义安、河静、广平、广治、广南、广义等省接界的寮国广大地区已为寮国人民解放军先后解放了。
    评论最后指出，寮国人民解放军在去冬今春战役中接连取得辉煌战绩后，又在封萨里取得了胜利，这对寮国、高棉和越南三国人民争取民族独立和世界和平的斗争是一个极大的鼓舞。
