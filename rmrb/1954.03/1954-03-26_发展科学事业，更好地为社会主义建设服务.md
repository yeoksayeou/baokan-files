    The "Report on the Basic Situation and Future Tasks of the Chinese Academy of Sciences," approved by the 204th meeting of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, is published in this newspaper today. From this report, one can understand the current status and future tasks of scientific work in our country. All relevant parties must, in accordance with the direction pointed out in this report, more actively participate in and assist scientific work, and promote the development of scientific undertakings.
    Scientific work is of great significance to national construction. To build our country into a socialist country with highly developed production and a highly prosperous culture, we must develop both natural sciences and social sciences. Now that our country's planned economic construction has begun, it is even more necessary to vigorously develop the natural sciences to promote the continuous development of production technology and to help fully understand and more effectively utilize natural resources. Without developed industry and agriculture, scientific undertakings cannot achieve vigorous development; and without developed scientific undertakings, the technological level of industrial and agricultural production cannot be further improved, and the cause of economic construction cannot be rapidly advanced.
    Our Party has always attached importance to scientific work. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government further proposed the task of striving to develop science. The Common Program stipulates: "Strive to develop the natural sciences to serve the construction of industry, agriculture, and national defense. Reward scientific discoveries and inventions, and popularize scientific knowledge." "Advocate the use of scientific historical viewpoints to study and explain history, economics, politics, culture, and international affairs. Reward outstanding works of social science." Under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, the center of national scientific research—the Chinese Academy of Sciences—was established. Government departments such as industry, agriculture, transportation, and health have also established their own scientific research institutions. The adjustment and expansion of various institutions of higher learning have also prepared the conditions for the development of scientific research work. Over the past four years, scientific workers across the country have worked diligently, learned advanced Soviet science and technology, solved many theoretical and practical scientific problems, and played a certain role in promoting the development of economic construction, national defense construction, and cultural undertakings. Much work has also been done in cultivating young scientific cadres. Through the tempering of successive political movements, ideological remolding studies, and the practice of scientific work, the level of awareness of scientific workers across the country has been significantly improved.
    However, the scientific foundation left to us by old China was very weak, there were not many scientific personnel, their level was generally not high, and the development of various sciences was also uneven. Although scientific work has made great progress in the past four years, it has not fundamentally changed the above-mentioned backward situation. The growth of scientific cadres and the accumulation of scientific experience require a considerable period of time. To change the backward state of science in our country and develop our country's scientific undertakings to meet the requirements of national economic construction, we must make long-term and arduous efforts. We must strive hard and catch up quickly, otherwise, the development of national construction undertakings will be hindered in the future due to the backwardness of science. At present, scientific work is still a relatively weak link in the country's various construction tasks, and there are still many serious shortcomings in scientific work. The nation's scientific forces have not been fully mobilized, and many potential forces have not been utilized; much scientific research work has not been correctly led and organized; the policy of uniting scientists has not been well implemented in some places; the work of cultivating young scientific cadres has generally not been done practically; the policy of learning advanced Soviet science has not been implemented in all aspects of scientific research work; and some cadres still lack sufficient understanding of the development of scientific undertakings, or are not good at leading and helping scientific research work. These situations must be effectively improved.
    The Chinese Academy of Sciences bears the primary responsibility for promoting scientific development. The Academy of Sciences should earnestly strengthen its leadership over the scientific work of various research units and implement the working principles and various work tasks approved by the Government Administration Council. As the center of national scientific work, the Academy of Sciences has the responsibility to closely connect with scientific workers across the country and assist and guide scientific research work in various fields. The people of the whole country, especially scientific workers across the country, should also care for and support this central institution, and all parties should assist and support its work. The report of the Academy of Sciences stipulates that a secretariat should be established under the Academy Affairs Conference and that four departments should be established, namely, the Department of Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences, the Department of Technical Sciences, and the Department of Social Sciences, to widely absorb outstanding scientists from inside and outside the Academy to participate in the Academic Committee of the Department and the Academic Committees of various research institutes. This is of great significance for strengthening the leadership of the Academy of Sciences over the work of various sciences and strengthening the connection between the Academy of Sciences and other scientific institutions.
    The scientific research institutions under the government departments of industry, agriculture, transportation, and health bear the primary responsibility for solving practical technical problems in production and construction. The various departments should strengthen their leadership over these scientific institutions, give full play to the role of existing scientific personnel, and gradually develop the scientific research strength of their departments according to needs and possibilities.
    A large number of scientific personnel are concentrated in universities and colleges across the country. In order to promote national economic construction and the development of science and culture, and in order to improve the scientific level of teaching in universities and colleges, it is necessary to actively carry out scientific research work in universities and colleges in a planned and active manner, in accordance with the principle of combining it with teaching.
    In order to develop our country's scientific undertakings, we must first rely on the hard work of scientists with a certain academic level. Scientists are a valuable asset to the country and society and an important construction force. The knowledge and labor of scientists should be valued and respected by the people. We should earnestly encourage scientists to give full play to their initiative in scientific research, care for and assist their research work, and arrange smooth conditions for their research work. That is to say, all scientific research institutions should use scientists as rationally as possible to give play to their expertise, and make it possible for them to concentrate their energy and time on scientific research work; they should solve their difficulties in lacking necessary equipment, funds, and assistants in scientific research work as much as possible. They should be allowed to train students in scientific research work and pass on their expertise to the next generation. When scientists achieve results in scientific research, they should be rewarded. Uniting scientists, caring for their work and life, and attracting them to actively participate in national construction; this is the Party and the government's fundamental policy in scientific work, and it must be implemented. Scientists should also be good at managing their time, strive to engage in scientific research work, and give play to the spirit of creation under relatively simple equipment conditions, and achieve good results.
    Vigorously training young scientific cadres and expanding the ranks of scientific workers is an important link in developing our country's scientific undertakings. Without the growth in quantity and the improvement in quality of scientific cadres, we cannot develop and improve our scientific undertakings. The number of scientific personnel in our country is originally very insufficient, and the training of young scientific cadres cannot but be a long-term and important task in our country's scientific work. All scientific institutions should earnestly carry out this work and establish necessary systems to guarantee it. When allocating university graduates every year, a considerable number of the best young people should be selected to do scientific research work (including all aspects of basic science, technical science, and social science). It is wrong to assign students with poor grades to do scientific research work. When enrolling students and sending students to study abroad in universities and colleges, in addition to a large number of students studying technical sciences, we should also ensure that a considerable number of excellent students go to study basic sciences and social sciences. Only in this way can we ensure the continuous growth of scientific work forces.
    Strengthening the leadership of the Party and the People's Government over scientific work is the basic guarantee for the healthy development of scientific undertakings. Government departments should strengthen the management and leadership of various scientific institutions under their jurisdiction, and the relevant Party organizations should also regularly care about the work of various scientific institutions and supervise the correct implementation of the Party's various policies in scientific work. Scientific work is very complicated and still a new job for us. We still lack experience in this regard. Relevant work cadres must be modest and cautious, avoid rudeness and simplicity, strive to learn policies, and conscientiously study business to do a good job. Under the care and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the joint efforts of scientific workers across the country, our country's scientific undertakings will surely be developed and prospered in the practice of serving national construction!

    发展科学事业，更好地为社会主义建设服务
    经中央人民政府政务院二百零四次政务会议批准的“关于中国科学院的基本情况和今后工作任务的报告”今天在本报发表了。从这个报告中，可以了解我国当前科学工作的状况和今后的任务。各有关方面必须依据这个报告所指出的方向，更积极地参与和协助科学工作，推动科学事业的发展。
    科学工作对国家建设具有重要的意义。要把我国建设成为生产高度发达、文化高度繁荣的社会主义国家，一定要发展自然科学和社会科学。在我国有计划的经济建设已经开始的时候，更必须大力发展自然科学，以促进生产技术的不断发展，并帮助全面了解和更有效地利用自然资源。没有发达的工业和农业，科学事业不可能获得蓬勃的发展，而没有发达的科学事业，工农业生产的技术水平也不可能进一步提高，经济建设事业不可能迅速地向前推进。
    我们的党从来是重视科学工作的。中华人民共和国成立以后，党和人民政府更提出努力发展科学的任务。共同纲领上规定了：“努力发展自然科学，以服务于工业农业和国防的建设。奖励科学的发现和发明，普及科学知识。”“提倡用科学的历史观点，研究和解释历史、经济、政治、文化及国际事务。奖励优秀的社会科学著作。”在党和政府的关怀与领导下，全国科学研究的中心——中国科学院建立起来了。工业、农业、交通、卫生等政府部门也都成立了自己的科学研究机构。各高等学校的调整和扩大，也为科学研究工作的发展准备了条件。四年来，全国科学工作者辛勤努力，学习苏联先进的科学技术，解决了不少理论的和实际的科学问题，在推进经济建设、国防建设和文化事业的发展上，起了一定的作用。在培养青年科学干部方面，也进行了许多工作。全国科学工作者通过历次政治运动的锻炼，通过思想改造学习和科学工作的实践，显著地提高了自己的觉悟水平。
    但是，旧中国给我们留下来的科学基础是很薄弱的，科学人员不多，水平一般不高，各门科学发展也不平衡。四年来，科学工作虽然有了很大的进步，但还没有根本改变上述的落后情况。科学干部的生长和科学经验的积累，都需要相当长的时期，要改变我国科学落后的状况，发展我国科学事业以适应国家经济建设的要求，我们必须作长期的、艰苦的努力。必须发奋努力，急起直追，否则将来就会由于科学的落后而阻碍国家建设事业的发展。目前科学工作仍然是全国各项建设工作中比较薄弱的一环，科学工作中仍然存在着许多严重的缺点。全国科学力量还没有充分动员，许多潜在力量还没有加以运用；许多科学研究工作还没有被正确地领导和组织起来；团结科学家的政策，在有些地方还执行得不很好；培养青年科学干部的工作一般还没有切实做好；学习苏联先进科学的方针，还没有贯彻到科学研究工作的一切方面去；而有些干部对发展科学事业还认识不足，或不善于领导和帮助科学研究工作。这些情况必须切实加以改进。
    在促进科学发展方面，中国科学院担负着主要的责任。科学院应当切实加强对各研究单位的科学工作的领导，贯彻执行政务院所批准的工作方针和各项工作任务。作为全国科学工作的中心的科学院，有责任密切联系全国科学工作者，协助和指导各方面的科学研究工作。全国人民，首先是全国科学工作者也应当关心和扶助这个中心机构，各方面都要协助和支持它的工作。科学院的报告中规定要在院务会议下设立秘书处并成立物理学数学化学部、生物学地学部、技术科学部、社会科学部等四个学部，广泛吸收院内外的优秀科学家参加学部委员会和各研究所的学术委员会。这对于加强科学院对各门科学工作的领导，加强科学院与其他科学机构的联系，都有重大的作用。
    工业、农业、交通、卫生等政府部门所属的科学研究机构对解决生产建设中的实际技术问题担负着首要的责任。各该部门应加强对这些科学机构的领导，充分发挥现有的科学人员的作用，并根据需要与可能逐步发展本部门的科学研究力量。
    全国各高等学校里集中了大量的科学人员，为了推进国民经济建设与科学和文化的发展，为了提高高等学校教学的科学水平，必须在与教学相结合的原则下，有步骤地积极地开展高等学校的科学研究工作。
    为要发展我国科学事业，首先必须依靠具有一定学术水平的科学家的辛勤努力。科学家是国家和社会的宝贵财富，是一支重要的建设力量。科学家的知识和劳动，应当受到人民的重视和尊敬。应当切实鼓励科学家在科学研究中发挥高度的积极性，关心和帮助他们的研究工作，为他们的研究工作安排顺利的条件。这就是说，各科学研究机构应该尽可能合理地使用科学家以发挥其专长，并使他们有可能集中精力与时间于科学研究工作；应该尽可能解决他们在科学研究工作中缺乏必要的设备、经费和助手的困难。要让他们在科学研究工作中培养出学生来，把他们的专长传授给下一代。当科学家在科学研究中获有成绩时，应该给以奖励。团结科学家，关心他们的工作和生活，吸引他们积极参加国家建设；这是党和政府在科学工作中的根本政策，必须贯彻执行。科学家也应当善于支配自己的时间，努力从事科学研究工作，并在比较简陋的设备条件下发挥创造的精神，做出良好的成绩。
    大力培养青年科学干部，扩大科学工作人员的队伍，这是发展我国科学事业的重要环节。没有科学干部在数量上的增长和质量上的提高，就不能发展和提高我们的科学事业。我国科学人员本来十分不够，青年科学干部的培养不能不是我国科学工作中的长期的重要任务。各科学机构都应当认真进行这项工作，并建立必要的制度加以保证。在每年分配大学毕业生时应该选拔相当数量的最优秀的青年去作科学研究工作（包括基础科学、技术科学和社会科学各方面）。分配成绩不好的学生去做科学研究工作是不对的。在高等学校招生和选派留学生时，除应有大量学生学习技术科学外，还应保证相当数量的优秀学生去学习基础科学和社会科学。只有这样，才能保证科学工作力量不断增长。
    加强党和人民政府对科学工作的领导，是科学事业健康发展的基本保证。政府各部门应加强对所属各科学机构的管理和领导，各有关党组织也应当经常关心各科学机构的工作，监督党的各项政策在科学工作中的正确执行。科学工作十分复杂，对我们来说还是一件新的工作，我们还很缺乏这方面的经验，有关工作干部必须虚心谨慎，力戒粗暴简单，努力学习政策，认真钻研业务，把工作做好。在党和人民政府的关怀和领导下，在全国科学工作人员的共同努力下，我国的科学事业一定能够在为国家建设服务的实践中发展起来，繁荣起来！
