    "Stretching vigorous wings in the azure sky, is it Eagle Peak?
    The youth of both countries guard these peaks,
    Many heroes have grown, how majestic,
    Victory's peak!"
    The somber sound of the Gayageum rapidly rose, and eight Korean girls in pink dresses played the instrument while chanting the famous modern Korean song "Eagle Peak Ballad," singing about the heroes of "1211" Height (i.e., Eagle Peak, known as Heartbreak Ridge by the enemy). Here, during Van Fleet's so-called "Autumn Offensive" in 1951, the enemy suffered casualties of more than 15,900 in a month and a half, without gaining an inch of land. This heroic height has always stood firm on the eastern front of Korea, controlling the important traffic roads on the left and right, blocking the enemy's road to attack Wonsan to the east and the central line to the west, becoming Korea's famous "East Coast Gate."
    Now, Park Chan-soo, one of the heroes of "1211" Height, has come to China.
    He is not yet twenty years old this year, but he has already fought for three years. He wears a Gold Star Medal, a First-Class National Flag Medal, two Second-Class Warrior Honor Medals, and a Military Merit Medal on his chest. This is the honor given to him by the motherland, and it is also a record of his fighting path.
    September 10, 1952, the twentieth day after he turned eighteen, a very important day in his life arrived. He took the oath to join the Party on an unnamed height east of "1211" Height. An ideal of fighting for the happiest tomorrow for the motherland and mankind encouraged him to fight more stubbornly. More than four months later, on January 17, 1953, he was ordered to come to the famous heroic position "1211" Height, leading a heavy machine gun squad to guard the raised area on the right side of "1211" Height. It was here, in the autumn of 1951, that Li Shou-fu, a nineteen-year-old labor party member and a Matrosov-style hero, used his young chest to block the enemy's muzzle, opening the road to victory. Therefore, Park Chan-soo and his comrades-in-arms swore to the northwest, to Pyongyang where Marshal Kim Il-sung was located: We must never lose this place that was exchanged for heroic blood.
    The situation was serious. This place protruded from the front line and was surrounded by enemies on three sides. Opposite was Kachi Peak, where an enemy regiment was stationed. Kachi Peak was higher than "1211" Height, 1,241 meters above sea level, and the mountain was covered with howitzers and other large-caliber cannons. On the "1181" Height on its right, the enemy's tank group was also firing direct-fire artillery. Every day, more than 20,000 shells fell on "1211" Height. The heavy machine gun position where Park Chan-soo was located had to endure thousands of shells every day. The shells turned over all the land on the entire height. Every day, the shells would destroy their firing ports. Sometimes, they had to work all night to repair the positions so that they could continue to monitor the enemy within a range of 180 degrees the next day, block the enemy's traffic arteries, block the enemy's attack route, and relentlessly and accurately eliminate the enemy.
    Three days before the armistice, on the morning of July 24, 1953, the sky was gloomy and foggy. Park Chan-soo grasped the law of the enemy's activities, prepared for battle, and calmly spied on the enemy from the gun's eye. As expected, at ten o'clock, more than sixty enemies sneaked over from Kachi Peak. The weather suddenly cleared up. Now, Park Chan-soo could clearly see the enemies wearing steel helmets and grass-green military uniforms, crawling secretly on the ground like beetles from the gun's eye. It was their bloody hands that massacred Korean mothers and children, burned cities and villages, poured tens of thousands of tons of steel onto this land, and took the precious lives of comrades like Li Shou-fu. It was they who occupied the land of southern Korea like venomous snakes, sucking the blood of the Korean people, and now they dared to climb to this sacred land. Park Chan-soo felt the blood rushing to his heart. He kept ordering himself and the deputy gunner: Calm down, stay calm. Closer, closer, only 300 meters away, Park Chan-soo squinted his eyes and burst out a "fire" from between his teeth. He pressed the machine gun with his hand, and bullets fell like a torrential rain on the depression in front of him. A large number of enemies fell. At this time, the enemy's tank direct-fire artillery rang out. Before he could hide, the gun's eye was destroyed. Bullets flew past his body, and the bulletproof plate in front of the machine gun was also penetrated. Park Chan-soo quickly moved the machine gun to another trench and stubbornly continued to fire. The enemy's tank direct-fire artillery continued to fire, and the deputy gunner Li Rentong was injured, and the heavy machine gun was also damaged. The situation became more and more urgent. Park Chan-soo ordered the ammunition handler to carry the deputy gunner back to the tunnel, and he dragged a spare machine gun from the tunnel. At this time, our artillery group also roared, completely suppressing the enemy's firepower. Park Chan-soo's heavy machine gun continued to fire. From the telescope, it could be clearly seen that there were forty-two corpses lying in this trench, which the enemy called the "trap ditch of death." In the last fifty-six days of the battle on "1211" Height, Park Chan-soo alone killed 368 enemies (including 137 American soldiers). He was awarded the title of Hero of the Republic for this. His squad eliminated a total of 626 enemies.
    Now, he has come to the motherland of his comrades-in-arms and met the mothers of his comrades-in-arms. He really seems to see his own mother. Hou Yanping, a martyr's relative of the Volunteer Army, said to him: "My son went to Korea and sacrificed to eliminate our common enemy. Today I see you, just like seeing my own son." Another mother of the Volunteer Army, Jia Lanwen, also took his hand and said: "My son is still in Korea. If you see him when you go back, please tell him what his mother said: He must guard the position well and do his best to help the Korean people. Before peace is completely achieved, don't come back to see me." Hearing these words, Park Chan-soo secretly made up his mind: "After returning to Korea, I will do everything in my power to defend the construction and security of the motherland."

    “一二一一”高地的英雄
  　 ——访朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄朴赞洙
    金凤
    “苍空中伸展着劲健的翅膀，是鹰峰吗？
    两国的青年守卫着这些山峰，
    成长了许多英雄，多么威严啊，
    胜利的山峰！”
    沉郁的伽倻琴声急速地高昂起来，八个穿着粉红色衣裙的朝鲜姑娘一面抚琴，一面曼声歌唱着现代朝鲜的著名歌谣“鹰峰山谣”，歌唱着“一二一一”高地（即鹰峰山，敌人称为伤心岭）的英雄。在这里，一九五一年范佛里特发动所谓“秋季攻势”时，一个半月中敌人付出一万五千九百多人的伤亡代价，没有取得寸土尺地。这块英雄的高地始终屹立在朝鲜东部前线，控制着左右两条重要的交通公路，挡住敌人由此向东进攻元山向西进攻中线的道路，成为朝鲜有名的“东海岸的闸门”。
    现在，“一二一一”高地英雄之一的朴赞洙来到了中国。
    他今年还不到二十周岁，却已经打了三年仗。在他胸前戴着一颗金星勋章，一枚一级国旗勋章，二枚二级战士荣誉勋章和一枚军功章。这就是祖国给他的荣誉，也是他所走过的战斗的道路的记录。
    一九五二年九月十日，他刚满十八岁以后的第二十天，他生命中十分重要的一个日子来到了。他在“一二一一”高地东面的一个无名高地上宣誓入党。一种为着祖国和人类最幸福的明天奋斗的理想鼓舞着他更顽强地战斗。四个多月以后，一九五三年一月十七日，他奉命来到著名的英雄阵地“一二一一”高地上，带领着一个重机枪小组扼守着“一二一一”高地右侧隆起的地方。就在这里，一九五一年秋季，十九岁的劳动党员、马特洛索夫式的英雄李寿福曾用自己年轻的胸膛挡住敌人的枪口，打开了胜利的道路。因此，朴赞洙和他的战友们向着西北方，向着金日成元帅所在的平壤宣誓：我们决不能失去这块用英雄鲜血换来的地方。
    局势是严重的。这个地方突出前沿，三面受敌，对面就是敌人一个团驻守的加七峰，加七峰又高于“一二一一”高地，拔海一二四一公尺，山上布满着曲射炮和其他大口径炮。在它的右侧的“一一八一”高地上，敌人的坦克群又发射着直射炮的火力。每天，有两万多发炮弹落到“一二一一”高地上。朴赞洙所在的重机枪阵地每天就要落下几千发炮弹。炮弹把整个高地上的土地都炸翻了。每天，炮弹都要把他们的射口打垮，有时，他们得通宵工作来修理阵地，以便第二天继续在一百八十度方向的范围内监视敌人，封锁敌人的交通要道，挡住敌人进攻的道路，无情地准确地消灭敌人。
    停战前的三天，一九五三年七月二十四日上午，天色阴沉，雾气弥漫。朴赞洙掌握了敌人活动的规律，做好了战斗准备，从枪眼里冷静地窥伺着敌人。果然不出所料，十点钟的时候，六十多名敌人偷偷地从加七峰那儿爬过来了。天气忽然晴朗起来。现在，朴赞洙从枪眼里可以清清楚楚看到那些头戴钢盔身穿草绿色军装，像甲虫一样在地上偷偷爬来的敌人。就是他们血淋淋的双手屠杀着朝鲜的母亲和儿童，烧毁着城市和乡村，用成万吨的钢铁倾泻到这土地上，夺去了像李寿福同志这样高贵的生命。就是他们像一条条毒蛇似地盘踞在朝鲜南部的土地上，吮吸着朝鲜人民的鲜血，现在又竟敢向这神圣的土地爬来。朴赞洙觉得心头的血直涌上来，他不住命令自己也命令副射手：冷静，再冷静。近了，更近了，只有三百公尺距离了，朴赞洙眯细了双眼，从牙齿缝迸出一声“打”，用手一按机枪，子弹像骤雨般落在面前那块洼地上。一大片敌人倒下去了。这时敌人坦克的直射炮响了起来，几乎来不及隐蔽，枪眼就被打垮。子弹从他身体的四周飞擦过去，机枪前的挡弹板也被打穿。朴赞洙迅速把机枪架到另一道战壕上，又顽强地继续射击着。敌人坦克的直射炮又连续打过来，副射手李仁东负了伤，重机枪也被打坏了。情势愈来愈紧急。朴赞洙命令弹药手把副射手抱回坑道，自己又从坑道内拖出一架备用的机枪来。这时候，我们的炮群也怒吼起来，完全压制了敌人的火力。朴赞洙的重机枪又连续发射着。从望远镜可以清楚地看到躺在这条敌人称为“死亡的陷阱沟”里的是四十二具尸体。在“一二一一”高地最后五十六天战斗中，朴赞洙一人打死敌人三百六十八名（其中有一百三十七名美军）他因此荣获共和国英雄称号。他的小组共消灭敌人六百二十六名。
    现在，他来到了他的战友的祖国，见到了他的战友们的母亲，他真仿佛看到自己的母亲一样。一位志愿军的烈属侯彦平对他说：“我的儿子到朝鲜去，为了消灭我们共同的敌人牺牲了。今天我看到你，就好像看到了自己的儿子。”另一位志愿军的妈妈贾兰文也拉着他的手说：“我的儿子还在朝鲜。回去你要是看到他，请你把母亲的话告诉他：要他好好守着阵地，尽力帮助朝鲜人民。在和平彻底实现以前，不要回来见我。”听到这样的话，朴赞洙暗暗下了决心：“回到朝鲜以后，要尽自己的一切力量保卫祖国的建设和祖国的安全。”（附图片）
