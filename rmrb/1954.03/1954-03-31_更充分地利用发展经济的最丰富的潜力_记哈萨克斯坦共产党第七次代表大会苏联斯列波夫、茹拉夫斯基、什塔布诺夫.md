More Fully Utilize the Richest Potential for Developing the Economy
    ——Notes on the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan by Soviet Sleptsov, Zhuravsky, and Shtabnov
    The Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan was held in Alma-Ata from February 16th to 18th. Comrade Shayakhmetov, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, delivered a summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan.
    The congress revealed that the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic possesses huge reserves and potential for developing many industrial sectors and making socialist agriculture flourish. Kazakhstan has abundant mineral resources of various kinds. Kazakhstan's land stretches from the outer Urals to the Tian Shan Mountains, and from the coast of the Caspian Sea to the Altai Mountains.
    Due to the various natural conditions, it is possible to cultivate all kinds of crops – from grains to subtropical crops. Under full sunshine, Kazakhstan can produce abundant wheat, millet, rice, cotton, beets, ramie, flax, tobacco… The republic has unlimited potential for developing highly productive animal husbandry, as well as vegetable growing and horticulture.
    The Soviet state has given the republic great help in raising its economy and culture. Advanced workers in industry and agriculture, some industrial enterprises, machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, relying on this help and utilizing existing resources, have achieved considerable success.
    At the same time, as the delegates said at the congress, there are great shortcomings in the work of developing the republic's national economy. Agriculture is particularly backward. Due to poor leadership by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in the development of the republic's national economy, the extremely abundant reserves have not been fully utilized. The local party, Soviet, and economic organs are not satisfactory in deciding the future of industrial and agricultural development.
    In industry, the use of reserves is hindered, primarily because construction plans have not been completed for many years. Last year, more than 80 percent of the construction departments failed to complete the capital construction investment plan. There is huge potential in improving labor productivity, better utilizing equipment capacity and existing production sites, reducing costs, and improving product quality.
    The level of agricultural production is not commensurate with the material and technical foundation that the state has already established. Many collective farms and state farms have very low yields of grain, industrial crops, vegetables, and potatoes every year. Despite abundant natural forage resources and a great possibility of increasing the total number of livestock and improving their output, the development of animal husbandry in the republic has long been backward. A large number of livestock have died from disease. The situation of the total number of female livestock is particularly unfavorable, which is the main source of reproduction and improvement of the output of the public livestock herd. The state's plan for developing public animal husbandry and providing livestock products is often not fulfilled.
    Major shortcomings in the work of machine tractor stations and machine animal husbandry stations have not yet been eradicated. They have not been strengthened with leading cadres, experts, and mechanics. They use machines very poorly, so the collective farms cannot guarantee the completion of the state's plan for crop yields and public animal husbandry product yields. The mechanization of arduous work in animal husbandry has been done completely unsatisfactorily.
    Guarantee the Reclamation of Virgin and Idle Land
    The issue of reclaiming virgin and idle land was the focus of the congress's discussion. In Kazakhstan, there are millions of hectares of uncultivated fertile land that can be planted with spring wheat, and even the most precious varieties of hard wheat, millet, and other crops.
    The congress delegates pointed out that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Council of Ministers of the republic did not draw the necessary conclusions from the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU and did not take the necessary measures to overcome the backwardness of agriculture. The leaders of the party and Soviet organs of the republic did not sufficiently recognize the importance of reclaiming virgin and idle land, thereby further developing the grain economy that constitutes the basis of agricultural production.
    Individual collective farms and individual regions have demonstrated initiative in the work of reclaiming virgin and idle land. On these reclaimed lands, they can harvest one hundred to one hundred and fifty poods of grain per hectare. The party and government organs of several states have already raised the issue of reclaiming new land, but they have not received the support they deserve from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Council of Ministers of the republic. At a plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Comrade Altykarin, secretary of the Jiangbul State Committee, once said: "The members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan are fully aware of the suggestions repeatedly made at our plenary sessions regarding the reclamation of new land. The main error of the secretaries of the Central Committee and the heads of the Council of Ministers of the republic is that they do not listen to and support these suggestions."
    The congress delegates therefore sharply criticized Comrade Shayakhmetov, the former first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Comrade Avanov, the former second secretary, Comrade Taibekov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the republic, and Comrade Milinikov, the vice chairman.
    Only after the Central Committee of the CPSU gave direct instructions to the republic did the work of actively preparing for land reclamation begin.
    In 1954 and 1955, the task of developing 6.3 million hectares of wasteland was placed before the republic. In order to realize this plan, the state supplied Kazakhstan with a large number of machines, sent cadres to use the machines, allocated construction materials and standard housing, etc. Many new state farms should be established in the reclamation area. This year, 39,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) will be transported to the republic's tractor stations, and 14,800 tractors will be given to state farms.
    At the meeting, the delegates pointed out that the working people of Kazakhstan welcomed the decision of the party and government to reclaim virgin and idle land with great political and production enthusiasm. Collective farm members, machine tractor station workers, and state farm workers are determined to gloriously complete the tasks of the state.
    The delegates sharply criticized the harmful views of individual leaders who, according to the old traditions, believed that developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry at the same time were contradictory. These people do not understand the truth: the rapid development of the grain economy creates favorable conditions for the upsurge of animal husbandry.
    The congress paid great attention to further increasing the total number of livestock and improving the product volume of livestock: such as establishing a solid feed base, improving the level of livestock management, mechanizing the arduous labor process of animal husbandry, solving the problem of livestock water supply, correctly utilizing and improving seasonal pastures, increasing the sowing of perennial and annual pastures, corn, root crops, fodder and melons, strengthening breeding work and improving livestock breeds.
    The congress pointed out that one of the important reserves of agricultural production is irrigated agriculture. However, in the republic, there is indifference to fully utilizing and expanding the irrigated area. Especially for the southern states that produce valuable economic crops - cotton, sugar beets, tobacco, etc. The possibility of irrigating new fields here without a lot of expenses was not used, and the land with existing irrigation networks was only used 60% to 70%.
    The speakers said that now, it is only by being good at summarizing and disseminating advanced experience that can lead agriculture skillfully. Rapidly increasing the endless reserves of production departments of all collective farms and state farms lies in this. There are many advanced agricultural producers in the republic, and their yields of grain, cotton, and sugar beets, and the production of milk and wool have reached very high indicators. However, the party and Soviet organs of the republic have not done a good job in studying and disseminating advanced experience. Few popular readings on agronomy and animal husbandry achievements and advanced experience are published. There are not many propaganda speeches on agricultural issues, and the use of powerful propaganda tools such as radio and movies in this regard is also not satisfactory.
    The delegates of the congress emphasized that the implementation of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU must be well and timely to complete the current agricultural work. They also talked about the situation in the republic in the preparations for spring sowing and livestock overwintering is not allowed to happen. Such as the slow progress of repairing tractors and other machines, the poor preparation of mechanical cadres, the failure to complete the plan to implement winter agricultural measures, there are many states that livestock feed is not guaranteed, and no measures have been taken to prevent livestock deaths and losses.
    Oppose Bureaucratic Leadership Methods
    In order to realize the current tasks of the republic, it is necessary to improve the leadership for the development of all economic and cultural departments. The congress pointed out: The reason why many national economic sectors, especially the agricultural sector, are in a backward state is due to the serious shortcomings in the working methods of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and Comrade Shayakhmetov, the former first secretary.
    The fundamental problems of developing the republic's national economy fell into a bureaucratic vortex of various instructions, resolutions, documents, letters, summaries, general talks, meetings and gatherings. The lively organizational work to complete the instructions of the party and the government was replaced by bureaucracy and good-sounding talks. The party and Soviet workers, agricultural experts are busy with paperwork and are separated from directly participating in improving the production organization work of collective farms and state farms.
    As Comrade Kuzhembaev, secretary of the South Kazakhstan State Committee, said: The leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Council of Ministers of the Republic have not been to the state for more than three years, have not cared about the reasons for the backwardness of the state, and have not helped to eliminate this situation. The staff of the republic does not know enough about the local work situation, so they cannot give the state organizations any clear opinions and decide on the prospects for developing agriculture.
    Comrade Nurkaev, chairman of the Kese Orkinsk State Executive Committee, said: "The leadership of the State Executive Committee by the Council of Ministers of the Republic is limited to a lot of resolutions, orders and telegrams. In many cases, we cannot get concrete help. Some leading staff members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan only know about our state from geography textbooks. And Comrade Taibekov, chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, not only has not been to our state, but has not even made a phone call to us in the past year."
    Comrade Abrachakov, secretary of the Central Committee of the Kazakhstan Communist Youth League, said at the conference: During the nine months he worked, he did not take the time to go to the collective farm once.
    Similar examples were also mentioned in the speeches of Comrade Iskakov, secretary of the Pavlodar State Committee, Comrade Bulaov, secretary of the Balkhash Municipal Committee, and other comrades.
    The delegates discussed the issues of party organization and political work very fiercely. The Central and State Committees of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan intolerably delayed the work of reorganizing the district party organs. In many cases, this work was either left to its own devices or fell into formalism. Most districts have not yet eliminated the attitude of no one being responsible and irresponsible for the leadership of collective farms and machine tractor stations. The political work for collective farm members and agricultural machine operators is in an unattended state and lacks contact with the concrete tasks of solving the republic. Most of the district party secretaries who lead the machine tractor stations and the work groups they lead are still staying in the center of the district and have not directly carried out organizational and political activities in the collective farms and machine tractor stations.
    The delegates pointed out the necessity of the party organization concentrating on the lively leadership and emphasized the special importance of strengthening the inspection of the implementation of the situation and ensuring the correct selection, allocation and education of cadres. They said: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and its former secretary, Comrade Shayakhmetov, made serious mistakes in the work of selecting and allocating cadres. There have been facts that cadres were selected not according to business and political standards, but according to the relationship between relatives and friends. This seriously violates the principles of the party.
    Some leading comrades have forgotten their responsibility for cadre work and often select people based on their personal grievances. Often on leadership positions are some inexperienced staff, while some talented trained cadres are buried. Some staff members are replaced in one area and transferred to other leadership positions without criticism. This is not able to correctly educate the cadres, on the contrary, it will breed irresponsibility, pride and confusion among some staff members who are not educated enough.
    Comrade Glacas, vice chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, and Comrade Zhangaogin, minister of trade of the republic, belonged to this category. They were promoted to this position after being dismissed from the previous position.
    Significant shortcomings were manifested in the propaganda work and the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres. Until recently, many party organizations were still destroying the voluntary principle of party education. In many groups and lectures, the theoretical explanation is often separated from the specific historical situation, and the leadership and guiding role of the Communist Party is not explained in depth, and it is often separated from the basic tasks of economy and politics.
    The most important reason for the serious shortcomings and errors in leading the economic and party political activities and the errors in the selection and education of cadres is that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan destroyed the collective nature, lacked criticism and self-criticism in its work. This created a harmful mood of indifference and complacency.
    Comrade Pan Kang Bonomarenko, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, delivered a speech at the congress.
    The Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan was held in an atmosphere of unity. The congress expressed the determination of the party organization to complete the republic's current major tasks of developing the national economy, culture, and improving the material well-being of the working people.
    At the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, the Standing Committee of the Party Central Committee was elected, Comrade Pan Kang Bonomarenko was elected first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Comrade L.I. Brezhnev was elected second secretary, and Comrade V.K. Kalibrenov, Comrade M.A. Surzhkov, and Comrade I.T. Tazhiev were elected secretaries.

    更充分地利用发展经济的最丰富的潜力
    ——记哈萨克斯坦共产党第七次代表大会苏联斯列波夫、茹拉夫斯基、什塔布诺夫
    哈萨克斯坦共产党第七次代表大会于二月十六日到十八日在阿拉木图市举行。哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会常委会委员沙亚赫米托夫同志作了关于哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会工作总结报告。
    代表大会上表现出，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国拥有发展许多工业部门和使社会主义农业蓬勃繁荣的巨大后备力量和潜在力量。哈萨克斯坦境内蕴藏着各种丰富的矿产。哈萨克斯坦的土地从外乌拉尔延伸到天山，从裹海沿岸延伸到阿尔泰山。
    由于具有各种不同的天然条件，有可能耕种一切农作物——从谷物到亚热带的农作物。在充分的阳光下，哈萨克斯坦能够生产丰富的小麦、黍、大米、棉花、甜菜、苎麻、亚麻、烟草……。共和国有发展高额产品的饲畜业以及种菜业和园艺的无限潜在力量。
    苏维埃国家在提高经济和文化方面，给了共和国很大的帮助。工农业中的先进者、一些工业企业、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场依靠这种帮助和利用现有的资源，获得了不小的成绩。
    同时，正如代表们在大会上所说的，在发展共和国国民经济的工作中，存在着很大的缺点。农业特别落后。由于哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会和哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国部长会议对共和国国民经济的发展领导不善，极其充沛的后备力量未能充分利用。地方的党、苏维埃和经济机关，在决定工农业发展的前途问题方面，不能令人满意。
    在工业方面，后备力量的运用受到阻挠，首先是因为许多年来完不成建设计划。去年建筑机关有百分之八十以上完不成基本建设投资计划。而在提高劳动生产率、更好地利用设备能力和现有生产场地、降低成本和改进产品质量方面，是蕴藏着巨大潜在力量的。
    农业生产水平和国家业已建立的物质技术基础不相适应。很多集体农庄和国营农场的谷物、技术作物、蔬菜、马铃薯的收获量每年都很低。尽管有丰富的天然饲料资源，有很大可能增长牲畜总头数和提高其产品量，但是共和国饲畜业的发展，长期是落后的。竟让大量牲畜因病死亡。母牲畜总头数的情形特别不顺利，而这是公有牲畜群的再生产和提高其产品量的主要来源。国家发展公有饲畜业和提供饲畜产品的计划经常不能完成。
    机器拖拉机站和机器饲畜站工作中的重大缺点，至今仍未根除。仍未以领导干部、专家和机械师来加强它们。它们对机器利用得很坏，使集体农庄不能保证完成国家农作物收获量和公有饲畜业产品量的计划。饲畜业中使繁重工作机械化的问题做得完全不能令人满意。
      保证开垦生荒地和熟荒地
    开垦生荒地和熟荒地的问题是大会讨论的中心。在哈萨克斯坦，有成百万公顷可以栽种春麦、甚至也可栽种硬小麦中最珍贵的品种、黍和其他作物的没有开垦的肥沃土地。
    大会代表指出，哈萨克斯坦党中央和共和国部长会议没有从苏共中央九月全会决议中获得应有的结论，没有采取必要的措施以克服农业的落后状况。共和国党和苏维埃机关的领导人对开垦生荒地和熟荒地，从而进一步发展组成农业生产基础的谷物经济的重要性认识不足。
    个别的集体农庄和个别地区在开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作中表现了首创精神。在这些开垦了的土地上，他们每公顷可收获一百到一百五十普特的粮食。某几州的党政机关已经提出了开垦新地的问题，但他们没有得到哈萨克斯坦党中央和共和国部长会议的应有支持。在哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会的一次全会上，江布尔州委书记阿尔特卡林也夫同志曾经说过：“哈萨克斯坦党中央的委员们完全知道在我们全体会议上屡次提出的关于开垦新地的建议。中央委员会书记们和共和国部长会议负责人的主要错误，是他们不倾听和不支持这些建议。”
    大会代表因此尖锐地批评了前任哈萨克斯坦党中央委员会第一书记沙亚赫米托夫、前任第二书记阿伐诺夫、共和国部长会议主席泰别科夫和副主席密里尼科等同志。
    只有在苏共中央给共和国以直接的指示以后，才开始积极准备垦荒的工作。
    在一九五四到一九五五年内，开拓六百三十万公顷荒地的任务摆在共和国面前。为了实现这个计划，国家供给哈萨克斯坦以大量的机器，派出使用机器的干部，拨发建设物资和标准房屋等等。在垦荒地区应当建立很多新的国营农场。今年，将运送三万九千部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）给共和国拖拉机站，给国营农场一万四千八百部拖拉机。
    会上，代表们指出，哈萨克斯坦的劳动人民以巨大的政治和生产热情来迎接党和政府开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决定。集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站工作人员、国营农场工人有决心光荣地完成国家的任务。
    代表们尖锐地批评了个别领导人的有害观点，他们依照旧的传统认为发展农业同时又发展饲畜业是矛盾的。这些人不懂得这个真理：谷物经济的迅速发展，对于饲畜业的高涨创造了有利的条件。
    代表大会对进一步增加牲畜总头数和提高牲畜的产品量给予了很大的注意：如关于建立巩固的饲料基地，提高牲畜管理的水平，饲畜业繁重劳动过程的机械化，解决牲畜给水问题，正确地利用和改善季节性的牧场，增加多年生和一年生的牧草、玉蜀黍、块根植物、秣草和瓜类的播种，加强良种工作和改善牲畜品种。
    代表大会指出，农业生产重要后备力量之一是灌溉的农业。但是，在共和国，对充分利用和扩大灌溉面积漠不关心。特别是对于生产有价值的经济作物——棉花、甜菜、烟草等的南方各州。这里无须大量开支而灌溉新的田地的可能性未加利用，而已有灌溉网的土地只利用了百分之六十到七十。
    发言者说，现在，只有在善于总结和传播先进经验的条件下才能熟练地领导农业。迅速提高所有集体农庄和国营农场生产部门的无尽的后备力量，便在于此。在共和国有不少的农业先进生产者，他们的粮食、棉花、甜菜的收获量，牛乳和羊毛的产量都达到了很高的指标。但是，共和国的党和苏维埃机关没有很好地从事于研究和传播先进经验。很少出版关于农学和动物饲养学成就以及先进经验的大众读物。有关农业问题的宣传演讲不多，在这方面对广播和电影等有力的宣传工具的利用，也不能令人满意。
    代表大会代表们强调指出，实现苏共中央九月全会的决议要很好地和及时地完成当前的农业工作。他们也谈到共和国在春季播种及牲畜过冬的准备工作中发生的状况是不能容许的。诸如拖拉机和别的机器的修理进行的迟缓，机械师干部准备得不好，进行冬季农业措施的计划没有完成，有许多州牲畜饲料没有保证也没有采取措施防止牲畜的死亡和损耗。
    反对官僚主义的领导方法
    为了实现共和国当前的任务需要改善对发展一切经济文化部门的领导。大会上指出：许多国民经济部门，特别是农业部门所以会存在落后状况，都是哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会常委会和前任第一书记沙亚赫米托夫同志在工作方法上的严重缺点所致。
    发展共和国的国民经济的根本问题，陷入了各种指令、决议、文件、信件、总结、一般的谈话、会议和集会等官僚主义的漩涡里。为完成党和政府的指示的生动组织工作，被文牍主义和好听的谈论代替了。党和苏维埃的工作人员、农业专家都在忙于文牍工作，与直接参加改善集体农庄和国营农场的生产组织工作脱离了。
    正如南哈萨克斯坦州党委书记库热姆巴也夫同志所说：哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会和共和国部长会议的领导人三年多就没有到过州里一次，没有关心过该州落后的原因，也没有帮助消灭这种情况。共和国工作人员对地方工作的情况不够了解，因而不能给州的组织任何明确意见和决定发展农业的远景。
    克塞·奥尔金斯克州执行委员会主席努尔卡也夫同志说：“共和国部长会议对州执行委员会的领导，只是限于很多的决议、命令和电报上。我们在很多情况下是得不到具体帮助的。哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会的一些领导工作人员仅仅是从地理教科书上才知道有我们这个州。而哈萨克共和国部长会议主席泰别科夫同志不仅没有到过我们州里，而且在最近一年里连一次电话都没有往我们这里打过。”
    哈萨克斯坦列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记阿勃拉查可夫同志在大会上说：在他工作的九个月期间，他没有抽空到集体农庄去过一次。
    巴夫洛达尔州委书记依斯卡考夫同志和巴尔哈什市委书记布拉乌夫同志以及其他一些同志的发言中，也都提到过类似的例子。
    与会代表十分激烈地讨论了党的组织和政治工作问题。哈萨克斯坦共产党中央和州委会令人不能容忍地拖延改组区级党机关的工作。在很多情况下，这一工作不是放任自流，就是陷入形式主义。大多数区对集体农庄和机器拖拉机站的领导，还未铲除无人负责和不负责任的态度。对集体农庄庄员和农业机器操使者的政治工作，处于无人照管状态，并与解决共和国当前具体任务缺乏联系。领导机器拖拉机站的大部分区党委书记和他们所领导的工作组，至今仍留在区的中心，而没有直接在集体农庄和机器拖拉机站中开展组织和政治活动。
    与会代表指出了党组织集中注意于生动的领导的必要性，并强调加强检查执行情况和保证对干部的正确的选拔、配备和教育的特殊重要性。他们说：哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会常委会及其前任书记沙亚赫米托夫同志在选拔和配备干部的工作中犯了严重的错误。有过这样的事实，不是按照业务和政治标准，而是按照亲朋的关系来选拔干部。这严重地违犯了党的原则。
    一些领导同志忘记了他们对待干部工作的责任，选拔人往往是从他个人的恩怨出发。常常在领导岗位上的是一些没有经验的工作人员，而一些有才能的受过训练的干部却被埋没了。有的工作人员在一个地区被撤换而不经过批评就调换到其他的领导岗位上。这样是不能够正确教育干部的，相反是会在一部分受教育不够的工作人员中滋长不负责任、骄傲和混乱。
    哈萨克共和国部长会议副主席格拉卡斯同志和共和国贸易部部长詹高金同志就属于这一类人，他们就是从前一工作岗位上被免职后，又被提升到这个岗位上的。
    在宣传工作和干部的马克思列宁主义教育上表现出显著的缺点。直到最近，很多党组织仍在破坏党教育的自愿原则。在很多小组和讲课中，理论的讲述常常是脱离具体历史情况，对共产党的领导和指导作用没有做深刻的阐述，并常常是脱离了经济和政治的基本任务。
    在领导经济和党的政治活动中的严重缺点和错误以及在选拔和教育干部方面产生错误的最重要原因，在于哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会常委会工作中破坏了集体性，缺乏批评和自我批评。这就产生了无所谓和心安理得的有害情绪。
    哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会第一书记潘·康·波诺马连科同志在大会上作了发言。
    哈萨克斯坦共产党第七次代表大会是在团结一致的气氛中举行的。大会表示出党组织完成共和国当前关于发展国民经济、文化和改善劳动人民物质福利的巨大任务的决心。
    在哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会全会上选出了党中央委员会常委会，选出潘·康·波诺马连科同志为哈萨克斯坦共产党中央委员会第一书记，勒·伊·布列日涅夫同志为第二书记，弗·克·卡利勃热诺夫同志、马·阿·苏日科夫同志和伊·特·塔日也夫同志为书记。
