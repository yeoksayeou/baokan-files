Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 10th: "Pravda" published an article by M. Avnin commenting on the US's new plan for Indochina.

He wrote that the Geneva Conference, to be held in April, opened up a clear prospect for easing international tensions and resolving urgent issues in Asia and the Far East. The Indochina issue is on the agenda. This issue could be resolved smoothly as long as all participants deem it necessary not to continue the hopeless war, but to negotiate the restoration of peace in Indochina based on the principles of freedom and national independence of all countries.

However, statements made by certain Western leaders and the newspapers they control prove that this approach is not suitable for those who prefer to pursue a policy of "strength."

Avnin quoted some words from an article by "Wall Street Journal" Washington correspondent, Krumley, who openly described the United States' latest plan to "defend" Indochina. According to Krumley, the "new" thing about this plan is that it is designed to prevent France from withdrawing from Indochina.

The State Department and the Pentagon are convinced that the upcoming Geneva Conference will ultimately fail (!), and the war will continue.

Avnin asked, what conclusion did the American strategists draw in this regard? He pointed out that the plan itself does not even mention the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue. Krumley said that efforts would be made to turn the Indochina war into a UN war, like Korea. He went on to say that troops would only be sent by Asian member states of the United Nations.

Avnin said that the "new" American plan embodies the famous American military strategy – "using Asians to fight Asians." The United Nations flag, which was shamefully and humiliatingly used by the US government in Korea, will be used to cover up the new US military adventure. It seems that some Washington politicians do not want to learn anything from historical lessons!

Avnin concluded: Therefore, the American aggressive bloc is manipulating public opinion in order to repeat the method of expanding the war that was used in Korea in Indochina. In other words, they are unwilling to consider the significant changes that have already taken place in Asia. They are unwilling to consider the fact that the people of Asia do not want to be cannon fodder in America's murderous war.

Disregarding the Asian people's desire to restore peace in Asia is pursuing an unrealistic policy.

### “真理报”载文评论美国对于印度支那的新计划  美国又打算盗用联合国旗帜侵略印度支那

    “真理报”载文评论美国对于印度支那的新计划
    美国又打算盗用联合国旗帜侵略印度支那
      【新华社十一日讯】　塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：“真理报”发表了米·阿弗宁的一篇文章，评论美国对于印度支那的新计划。
    他写道，将在四月召开的日内瓦会议，为缓和国际紧张局势、解决亚洲和远东的迫切问题展开了明确的远景。印度支那问题是议程中的一项。只要全体与会者认为有必要不通过继续进行没有希望的战争，而通过根据各国人民自由和民族独立的原则来协商恢复印度支那的和平，这个问题就可能得到顺利的解决。
    然而，某些西方领袖和他们控制下的报纸所发表的声明证明，这种方法并不适合于那些喜欢奉行“实力”政策的人的口味。
    阿弗宁自“华尔街日报”驻华盛顿记者克罗姆莱公开叙述美国“防御”印度支那最新计划的一篇文章中摘录了一些话。根据克罗姆莱所说，这个计划的“新”的一点是，它是拟订用来防止法国从印度支那撤退的。
    国务院和五角大楼深信，即将来临的日内瓦会议最后将失败（！），战争将继续下去。
    阿弗宁问道，美国战略家在这一方面得到的是什么结论呢？他指出，计划本身甚至没有提到和平解决印度支那问题的可能性。克罗姆莱说，将要设法使印度支那战争变为联合国战争，就像朝鲜那样。他接着说，军队将只由联合国的亚洲会员国派遣。
    阿弗宁说，“新”的美国计划体现了出名的美国军事战略——“用亚洲人打亚洲人”。曾经可耻地、羞辱地被美国政府在朝鲜利用过的联合国旗帜，将被用来遮掩美国新的军事冒险。看来，某些华盛顿政治家并不想从历史教训学习任何东西！
    阿弗宁最后说：因此，美国侵略集团正在摆布舆论，以便把在朝鲜搬弄过的扩大战争的办法搬到印度支那来重演。换句话说，他们不愿意考虑在亚洲已经发生的重大变化。他们不愿意考虑一个事实——亚洲人民不愿意在美国的杀人战争中当炮灰。
    不顾亚洲人民对恢复亚洲和平的愿望，就是奉行不切合实际的政策。
