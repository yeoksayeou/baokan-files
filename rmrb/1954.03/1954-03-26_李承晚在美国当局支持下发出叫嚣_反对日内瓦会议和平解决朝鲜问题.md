    Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, March 25th: Syngman Rhee's group's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, stated on the 23rd that US Secretary of State Dulles' "guarantee" to Syngman Rhee, agreeing to withdraw from the Geneva Conference ninety days after it began, had "encouraged" the Syngman Rhee group.
    Encouraged and supported by the US authorities, Syngman Rhee once again issued shouts against the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference and preparations to resume the war. According to a report by the International News Service on the 23rd, "Syngman Rhee said today that the Geneva Conference on April 26th must not unify Korea, and he demanded that the United States provide weapons, air force and naval support so that South Korean infantry could advance north if the conference fails." Syngman Rhee predicted that the "ending" of the Geneva Conference would certainly be a failure. He stated that if he could not "unify" Korea according to his fascist methods, he would restart the invasion, and told the United States that he needed to build more armies than the existing twenty divisions.

    李承晚在美国当局支持下发出叫嚣
    反对日内瓦会议和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十五日讯】汉城消息：李承晚集团外务部长官卞荣泰二十三日表示，美国国务卿杜勒斯向李承晚提出的同意在日内瓦会议举行九十天后退出会议的“保证”，已使李承晚集团受到“鼓舞”。
    在美国当局的鼓励和支持下，李承晚再次发出反对在日内瓦会议上和平解决朝鲜问题和准备恢复战争的叫嚣。据国际新闻社二十三日报道，“李承晚今天说，四月二十六日举行的日内瓦会议决不能使朝鲜统一，他要求美国给予武器、空军和海军的支持，以便使韩国步兵能够在会议失败时向北挺进。”李承晚预料日内瓦会议的“结局”一定是失败。他表示，如果不能按照他的法西斯方式来“统一”朝鲜，他就要重新发动侵略，并且向美国表示需要建立比现有的二十个师更多的军队。
