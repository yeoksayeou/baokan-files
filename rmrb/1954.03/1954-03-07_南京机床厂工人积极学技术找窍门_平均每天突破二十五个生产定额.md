Workers at the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant have been continuously setting new records and exceeding their original production quotas since the beginning of this year. According to a survey conducted at the start of the year, workers are exceeding more than twenty-five production quotas on average each day. Up to now, based on incomplete statistics from the casting, forging, and machining workshops, 335 of the plant's production quotas for major products in the first half of this year have been replaced by these new records. Some production achievements have improved by one to ten times compared to the quotas, further unleashing the potential of production.

The production quotas adopted by the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant this year were only determined after discussions at the end of last year and generally reached the average advanced level, so it was not easy to catch up with such quotas quickly. However, workers actively overcame conservative thinking, learned advanced experience, improved operating techniques, and adopted various methods to improve production efficiency. Wang Xizhen, a grinder, used to spend fifteen minutes grinding thrust bearing on a small surface grinder, and the quality was not good. This time the quota was changed to twelve minutes, but she humbly learned from comrades with high skills, and as a result, it only took three minutes to grind, and the quality also reached 100%. For example, as a result of the brainwork and trick-finding of the planing group workers, the quota hours for each process were exceeded. The reason why the plant constantly breaks production quotas is that the workers have learned the General Line and improved their labor enthusiasm. Qin Baozhong, a lathe operator who broke the new quota and increased production efficiency four times, initially tried to use high-speed cutting to turn screws, but unexpectedly encountered difficulties with poor quality. So he encouraged himself: "Building socialism is inherently an arduous task. How can we achieve it readily without exerting effort and overcoming difficulties?" Therefore, he continued his research and finally succeeded.

    南京机床厂工人积极学技术找窍门
    平均每天突破二十五个生产定额
    南京机床厂工人在今年开年以来，不断创造新纪录，突破原有的生产定额。据年初调查，平均每天有二十五个以上的生产定额被工人们突破。到现在为止，根据铸工、锻工和加工三个车间不完全的统计，全厂今年上半年主要产品的生产定额，已经有三百三十五个为这些新纪录所代替，其中有的生产实绩比定额提高一倍到十倍以上，进一步发挥了生产潜在力量。
    南京机床厂今年度开始采用的生产定额都是在去年底才经过讨论确定下来的，一般都达到了平均先进水平，所以，很快要赶上这样的定额并不是很容易的。但是，工人们积极地克服保守思想，学习先进经验，改进操作技术，采用各种办法提高了生产效率。磨工王喜珍在小平面磨床上磨推承轴，过去每次要十五分钟，质量还不好，这次定额改为十二分钟，但是，她虚心向技术高的同志学习，结果只要三分钟就磨出来了，而且质量也达到了百分之百。又如?刮组工人动脑筋、找窍门的结果，每道工序的定额工时都被突破。该厂不断突破生产定额的原因，是由于工人们学了总路线，提高了劳动热情。突破新定额，提高生产效率四倍的车工秦宝忠，最初试用高速切削来车螺丝，不料发生了质量差的困难，于是他就这样鼓励自己：“建设社会主义本来就是艰巨的任务，那有不卖力气、不克服困难就能现现成成的达到呢？”因此他又继续研究，最后终于获得成功。
