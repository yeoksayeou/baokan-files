    The Chinese Communist Party, Qishan County Committee, Shaanxi Province,
    Formulates an Outline for Unified Arrangements for Spring Production and General Election Work
    Based on the current need to combine spring production with the general election, the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shaanxi Province has formulated an outline for unified arrangements for this year's spring production and general election work. The purpose of formulating this outline is to try to overcome the generalized leadership style at the county level and to help cadres working in the countryside clarify the specific requirements for various current tasks, so as to truly make production the center of rural work while also smoothly completing the general election.
    Before formulating this outline, the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a review of the integration of production and other work in the county in the past. The review found that the biggest reason why agricultural production was easily squeezed out by other work in the past was that cadres had incorrect views on leading agricultural production, considering production a "soft task" that could be led or not. The main reason for fostering this erroneous thinking among cadres was that the county-level leadership's instructions to lower levels regarding production tasks were too generalized, without specifying what specific tasks should be completed within a specific time frame, what centers should be grasped, and to what extent the work should be done. Therefore, when reviewing the work, there was no standard for measuring the quality of cadres' work. This time, the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party hopes to solve this problem by first changing the leadership style at the county level in formulating the unified arrangement outline for production and general election work. For example, the second part of the unified arrangement outline makes the following provisions for the arrangement and requirements of production: "In the first five days after the start of the first stage of the general election (ten days for areas with more outstanding grain purchase issues), regardless of the area, the focus should be on mobilizing production, and efforts must be made to mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for production. When mobilizing the masses, the great significance of this year's agricultural production and the prospects of the general line and socialism should be clearly explained. At the same time, by calculating detailed accounts and reminiscing, farmers should be made to recognize the differences between the old and new regimes and enhance their enthusiasm for loving the country and loving the government. In these few days, the specific requirements are: First, strive to get the masses to complete the unfinished earth-hauling and to deliver the unfinished manure to the fields; second, help mutual aid teams to become active through production activities; third, in areas with fewer outstanding grain purchase issues, strive to use production gaps to resolve the outstanding issues." Such regulations put forward to district and township cadres the central tasks that should be grasped in each stage and the specific matters that should be paid attention to, as well as how to appropriately combine other tasks that should be combined. In addition, the unified arrangement outline also places the principle that the general election work must be carried out in the gaps of production without hindering production in a primary position. This makes it easier for cadres to clearly understand that it is wrong to encroach on farmers' production time to do other work; but this does not prevent doing other work through production.
    The unified arrangement outline formulated by the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also focused on solving the difficulty that grassroots cadres often feel "at a loss" when dealing with certain tasks. For example, regarding the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation, in the past, when the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party arranged mutual aid and cooperation work, in addition to stipulating the numbers and percentages to be achieved, there were only the principles of "continuing to consolidate and improve, and vigorously develop." Such general requirements were not easy for lower-level cadres to clarify. This time, the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party paid attention to this issue. In the third part of the outline regarding the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation, it focused on explaining how to start the current mutual aid and cooperation work and how to further lead the mutual aid teams, and also put forward specific requirements, so that grassroots cadres have rules to follow when carrying out their work.
    At present, the unified arrangement outline for spring production and the general election formulated by the Qishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has been printed and distributed. In addition to preparing to focus on key inspections, the Qishan County Committee will also urge various districts to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of this outline, so that spring plowing production and general election work can be truly closely integrated.

    中共陕西岐山县委员会
    订出春季生产和普选工作统一安排的纲要
    中共陕西省岐山县委员会根据目前春季生产必须和普选结合进行的需要，订出了今年春季生产和普选工作统一安排的纲要。这个纲要制订的目的，在于试图克服县级领导作风一般化的毛病，并帮助下乡干部明确对当前各种工作的具体要求，以便真正使生产成为农村工作的中心，同时又能顺利完成普选。
    中共岐山县委员会在制订这个纲要以前，曾对该县过去生产和其他工作相结合的情况进行了检查。经过检查，发现过去该县农业生产容易被其他工作挤掉的最大原因，是干部对领导农业生产存在着不正确的看法，认为生产是“软任务”，可领导可不领导。而助长干部这种错误思想的主要原因，是县级领导向下面交代生产任务时太一般化，没有交代在具体的时间内要完成什么具体任务，要抓住什么中心，工作要作到什么程度等，因此在检查工作时也就没有一个衡量干部工作好坏的标准。中共岐山县委员会这次制订统一安排生产和普选工作的纲要，就是希望首先通过县的领导作风的改变，来解决这一问题。譬如在统一安排纲要第二部分，对生产的安排和要求便作了这样的规定：“在普选第一阶段开始后的头五天中（收购粮食遗留问题较多的地区可以十天），不分任何地区，一律以动员生产为中心，务必把群众生产热情动员起来。动员群众时应讲清今年农业生产的重大意义，讲清总路线和社会主义的前景，同时并从算细账、回忆，使农民认识新旧政权的不同，提高农民爱国家，爱政府的热情。在这几天中，具体要求：一、争取让群众把未拉够的土拉够，把未送到地里的粪送完；二、要帮助互助组通过生产活动起来；三、收购粮食遗留问题较少的地区，争取利用生产空隙把遗留问题处理完毕。”这样规定就向区乡干部提出了每一阶段应该抓住的中心工作和应注意的具体事项，以及对其他应该结合的工作如何适当结合的办法。此外，统一安排纲要中还把普选工作必须在不妨碍生产的原则下利用生产空隙进行，提到首要地位。这样就容易使干部思想上明确侵占农民生产时间来作其他工作是错误的；但这并不妨碍通过生产去作其他工作。
    中共岐山县委员会制订的统一安排纲要中，还着重解决了基层干部对某些工作时常感到“无从下手”的困难。譬如关于互助合作的领导问题，过去中共岐山县委员会在布置互助合作工作时，除了规定应达到的数字、百分比以外，再就是“继续巩固提高，大力发展”的原则，这样笼统的要求，不容易使下层干部明确起来。这次中共岐山县委员会注意了这个问题，在纲要第三部分关于互助合作领导中，着重交代了当前互助合作工作应如何下手，如何进一步领导互助组等问题，同时也提出了具体要求，使基层干部进行工作时有矩可循。
    目前，中共岐山县委员会制订的关于春季生产和普选统一安排纲要已经印发下去。岐山县委员会除准备抓紧重点检查外，并将督促各区普遍检查这一纲要贯彻执行的情况，使春耕生产和普选工作能够真正密切结合进行。　（新华社）
