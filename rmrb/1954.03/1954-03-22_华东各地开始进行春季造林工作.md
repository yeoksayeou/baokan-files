East China Begins Spring Afforestation Work

    Spring afforestation work is actively underway in various parts of East China. Fujian, Anhui, Zhejiang and other provinces have entered the action phase.
    To ensure the completion of this year's afforestation tasks according to plan, the leading departments of various provinces have successively held meetings to actively deploy spring afforestation work. Fujian Province will afforest 700,000 mu this year, focusing on Jianyang, Nanping and Yong'an special districts in the Min River basin for timber forest cultivation. Last autumn, the Provincial Forestry Department dispatched more than 30 cadres and technicians to major mountainous counties to inspect the preparation work for planting Chinese fir and to assist local governments in organizing the masses for grass clearing, mountain burning and land preparation. Currently, governments at all levels are actively leading the masses to launch a spring afforestation campaign. Zhejiang Province purchased more than 560,000 jin of tree seeds last autumn. At present, Quzhou Special District and other places have implemented forestry policies through various meetings. Longquan, Kaihua and other key afforestation counties have established afforestation stations to actively carry out Chinese fir planting. In mid-February, the Anhui Provincial Forestry Department dispatched four inspection teams composed of section chiefs, engineers and technicians to the four special districts of Liu'an, Huizhou, Wuhu and Anqing to assist in afforestation work. So far, the special districts have completed more than 42,000 mu of direct seeding, tree planting and cutting propagation. The province's afforestation work has now entered a tense stage of full-scale action. Shandong Province is currently holding agricultural, forestry and water conservancy meetings to actively discuss and deploy spring afforestation work. Jiangsu Province will afforest more than 200,000 mu this spring, planning to cultivate 85,000 mu of pine and oak timber forests in Xuzhou and Zhenjiang special districts, and 70,000 mu of sand prevention forests in the old course of the Yellow River in the Huaihai area.

    华东各地正在积极展开春季造林工作。福建、安徽、浙江等省已进入行动阶段。
    为使今年造林任务按计划完成，各省领导部门相继召开了会议，积极布置春季造林工作。福建省今年造林七十万亩，并以闽江流域的建阳、南平、永安三个专区为营造用材林的重点。该省林业厅曾于去秋派出三十多个干部和技术人员深入各主要山区县份检查插杉造林准备工作，并协助当地政府组织群众，进行劈草炼山整地工作。目前各级政府正积极领导群众展开春季造林突击工作。浙江省在去年秋季即已采购了五十六万余斤树木种子。目前，衢州专区等地已通过各种会议贯彻林业政策，重点造林县的龙泉、开化等县已建立造林站，积极进行插杉造林工作。安徽省林业厅在二月中旬抽调了科长、工程师、技术员等组成四个检查小组，前往六安、徽州、芜湖、安庆四个专区协助造林工作。到目前为止，各专区已完成直播、植树、插条造林四万二千余亩，该省造林工作现已进入全面行动的紧张阶段。山东省目前正在召开农林水利会议，积极讨论布置春季造林工作。江苏省今年春季造林二十余万亩，计划在徐州、镇江专区营造松栎用材林八万五千亩，同时在淮海地区黄河故道营造防沙林七万亩。目前，该省群众纷纷投入春季造林运动。
