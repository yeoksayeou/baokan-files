    Anshan workers enthusiastically subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds
    The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and various units in Anshan City are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. According to preliminary statistics from the Anshan City Bond Sales Committee in mid-February, 23 units have essentially completed their subscriptions, with the average subscription figure reaching over 170% of the projected figure.

    The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, standing at the forefront of the country's industrial construction, have a deep understanding of the great significance of the state issuing economic construction bonds to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. When Meng Tai, a famous labor model, saw the news of the state issuing economic construction bonds in the newspaper, he said, "We, the working class, must take the lead in everything. Besides, our lives have improved in recent years, and we should use our surplus money to buy bonds so that the country can achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible." After the official subscription to the bonds began, Wang Chonglun, a special-class labor model of Anshan City and a young worker who completed four years' worth of work in one year, used his 5 million yuan bonus to buy bonds. He said, "For the construction of our motherland and for our future happiness, we all have a responsibility to do our part to buy bonds. If everyone takes out their surplus money to buy bonds, we can gather a lot of funds to invest in the 141 key projects." The workers in other departments of Anshan City also enthusiastically subscribed. The subscription figure of the City Grain Company exceeded the original plan by 69.1%; as of February 15, the employees of the health department had subscribed to more than 244 million yuan, exceeding the projected figure by 250%.

    鞍山职工踊跃认购国家经济建设公债
    鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山市各单位的职工，踊跃认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债。据鞍山市公债推销委员会在二月中旬的初步统计，已有二十三个单位基本认购完毕，认购数字平均达预计数字的百分之一百七十以上。
    站在祖国工业建设前哨的鞍山钢铁公司的职工们，对于国家发行经济建设公债，可以加速国家社会主义工业化的伟大意义，有着深切的体会。著名的劳动模范孟泰，在报纸上看到国家发行经济建设公债的消息时说：“我们工人阶级处处要起带头作用，再说，这几年来我们的生活改善了，应该把余钱来买公债，使国家早日实现社会主义工业化。”开始正式认购公债以后，鞍山市特等劳动模范、一年完成四年任务的青年工人王崇伦，拿五百万元奖金买了公债。他说：“为了建设咱们的祖国，为了咱们将来的幸福，咱们大伙有责任尽自己的力量来买公债。大伙把余钱拿出来买公债，咱们就能聚集许多资金投到一百四十一项重点工程中去。”鞍山市其他部门的职工也都踊跃认购。市粮食公司认购数字超过原来计划百分之六十九点一；到二月十五日止，卫生部门的职工已认购两亿四千四百多万元，超过预计数字百分之二百五十。
