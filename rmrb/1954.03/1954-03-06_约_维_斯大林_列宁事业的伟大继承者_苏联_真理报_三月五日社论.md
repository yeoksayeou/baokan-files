Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th (TASS):
    Today, the Soviet people and the working people of the world commemorate the first anniversary of the death of J.V. Stalin, the leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet people, and the great successor to the immortal cause of V.I. Lenin. A year ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in their announcement to all party members and all working people of the Soviet Union on the death of J.V. Stalin, expressed their firm belief that the Party and the Soviet people would unite more closely around the Central Committee and the Soviet government, and strive to build the great cause of communism.
    Stalin's life and activities are inseparable from the history of our glorious Communist Party and the Party's heroic struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people. Stalin began his revolutionary activities when Lenin launched a great struggle to establish a new type of Marxist party in Russia. From the beginning of his political activities, Stalin was a loyal son of the Party, a talented student and successor of Lenin. He tirelessly helped Lenin build our Party.
    The Communist Party, established and nurtured by the revolutionary genius Lenin, led our people's struggle against the oppression of the Tsar, landlords, and bourgeoisie. The Communist Party established the worker-peasant alliance, aroused the Russian people to attack capitalism, ensured the breakthrough of the world imperialism's front, established the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country, and established the first socialist country in the world. Under the complex and difficult conditions of establishing and consolidating the Soviet state, Stalin was one of Lenin's closest assistants and comrades-in-arms.
    After establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Party assumed full responsibility for the destiny of the motherland. The Party faced a new historical task: it had to defend the fruits of the socialist revolution from countless enemies at home and abroad; in the shortest possible time, eliminate the technical and economic backwardness of our country; and change the face of all social life on the basis of socialism. The Party confidently set about solving the arduous tasks before it. The brilliant strategist Lenin led the Party to new victories, formulating a scientifically grounded program for transforming economically backward Russia into an advanced and powerful socialist country.
    After the death of V.I. Lenin, the creator of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, J.V. Stalin and other students of Lenin led our Party in its efforts to realize Lenin's legacy. The enemies of the Party and the people—the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and bourgeois nationalists—tried to lead the Party and the state away from Lenin's path, spread distrust of the power of the working class and the peasantry, and denied the possibility of building socialism in our country. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, the Communist Party crushed the traitors and capitulationists, defended Leninism, and bravely led the Soviet people on the path of great socialist transformation in our country. In the years of the pre-war Five-Year Plans, the Soviet people realized Lenin's program of socialist construction, victoriously realized the industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, built a socialist society, and fundamentally improved the material conditions and cultural level of the working people.
    The Communist Party has always unswervingly implemented Lenin's legacy, tirelessly consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union—the foundation of the Soviet state's consolidation and strength.
    The Soviet social system and state system established in our country demonstrated great, invincible strength during the Great Patriotic War against the German fascist aggressors. Thanks to the strength of the Soviet state and the wise leadership of the Communist Party, thanks to the selfless heroism of the Soviet people, our people defeated the fascist aggressors, won a victory of world historical significance, and defended the freedom and independence of their motherland. The defeat of the German and Japanese fascist aggressors created the conditions for the establishment of an invincible camp composed of peace-loving countries such as the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia. All these great victories of the Soviet people are inextricably linked with Stalin's name, who, during the war years, led the Defense Committee and the Soviet army.
    J.V. Stalin was an outstanding creative Marxist theorist. Stalin summed up the extremely rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the modern international liberation movement, creatively developed the theories of Marxism-Leninism, applied them to new historical conditions, and enriched revolutionary theory with new principles on many issues.
    All the activities of the Communist Party follow the great teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The policies formulated by the Party over the years are based on the solid theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism and reflect the fundamental interests of the people. The Soviet people express their boundless trust and ardent love for their dear Communist Party because serving the working people is the highest criterion of the Party's activities. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are advancing confidently toward new victories in the construction of communism in our country.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have completed the Fourth Five-Year Plan and are now sparing no effort and labor to strive to realize the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The Party strives to continuously develop the production of the whole society, thereby further and continuously increasing the welfare of the people and fully meeting the people's growing material and cultural needs.
    The Party tirelessly cares about the further development of heavy industry, because heavy industry was and always will be the foundation of the prosperity of the socialist economy. The powerful heavy industry that has been established in our country is a solid foundation for accelerating the development of light industry and the food industry. The resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the resolutions on agricultural issues subsequently adopted by the Party and the government, have laid out concrete programs for the rapid development of all sectors of agricultural production. The Party and the government attach particular importance to the further development of grain production, because the success in developing grain production is essential for the development of all other sectors of agriculture and for meeting the growing needs of residents and the entire national economy.
    The most important condition for guaranteeing the victorious construction of communism in our country is to constantly strengthen the strength of the Soviet socialist state. The Communist Party will continue to tirelessly strive to consolidate the Soviet state, consolidate the foundation of the Soviet state's power—the worker-peasant alliance, and consolidate the friendship of all nationalities of our great multinational motherland.
    Leninism teaches us that the iron unity and rock-solid solidarity of the Party's ranks are the main conditions for guaranteeing the Party's consolidation and strength, and the main conditions for guaranteeing the Party's successful role as the guiding and leading force of the Soviet people. Stalin's great achievement lies in his unremitting struggle for the unity of our Party's ranks and for strengthening the Party's combat effectiveness. Our Party has always protected its unity as it protects the apple of its eye, constantly developing intra-Party democracy, strictly adhering to the long-tested Leninist principle of collective leadership, cultivating Communist Party members into active political fighters for the implementation of the Party's policies and resolutions, and further consolidating the ties between the Party and the masses.
    The ongoing election campaign for the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union clearly demonstrates the inseparable ties between the Party and the people, and demonstrates the indestructible strength of the alliance between the Communist Party and non-Party people, which Stalin called a natural and vital thing in our country. The source of all our victories lies in the great unity of the Party, the government, and the people.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet state has always unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, the principles of which were formulated by Lenin and persistently implemented by Stalin. The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy proceeds from Lenin and Stalin's principle that two different systems—the capitalist system and the socialist system—can coexist for a long time and compete peacefully. The Communist Party and all the people of the Soviet Union believe that their sacred duty is to defend the cause of peace, to defend and consolidate the greatest achievements of all peoples—the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and to consolidate the eternal fraternal friendship with the Chinese people and the working people of all people's democratic countries.
    Under the banner of the great, invincible doctrines of Marx-Lenin, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are advancing confidently towards the glorious peaks of communism. The working people of the people's democratic countries are also firmly advancing along the road of socialist construction under this banner.
    The brilliance of the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin illuminates the path of all the people of the world towards freedom and happiness.

    约·维·斯大林——列宁事业的伟大继承者
    ——苏联“真理报”三月五日社论
    今天，苏联人民和全世界劳动人民纪念共产党和苏联人民的领袖、乌·伊·列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林逝世一周年。一年前，苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团在为约·维·斯大林逝世而发表的告全体党员、苏联全体劳动人民的公告中表示坚信：党和苏联人民将更加紧密地团结在中央委员会和苏维埃政府的周围，为建成共产主义的伟大事业而奋斗。
    斯大林的一生和活动是和我们光荣的共产党的历史、以及党为争取人民的自由和幸福而进行的英勇斗争分不开的。当列宁为在俄国建立马克思主义的新型政党而展开了巨大的斗争时，斯大林就开始了革命活动。从他开始政治活动的时候起，斯大林就是党的忠实的儿子、列宁的天才学生和继承者。他不倦地帮助列宁建立我们的党。
    革命的天才列宁建立和培养起来的共产党，领导了我国人民反对沙皇、地主和资产阶级压迫的斗争。共产党建立了工农联盟，唤起了俄国人民群众向资本主义进攻，保证了突破世界帝国主义的阵线，在我国建立了无产阶级专政并建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。在建立和巩固苏维埃国家的复杂和困难的斗争的条件下，斯大林是列宁的最亲密的助手和战友之一。
    党在建立了无产阶级专政之后，就担负起对祖国命运的全部责任。党面临了一项新的历史任务：必须保卫社会主义革命的胜利果实，免遭无数国内外敌人的侵害；在最短时期内，消除我国技术和经济上的落后状态，在社会主义的基础上改变全部社会生活的面貌。党充满信心地着手解决摆在它面前的艰巨任务。天才的战略家列宁领导着党走向新的胜利，他制订了关于把经济落后的俄国改造为先进的、强大的社会主义国家的有科学根据的纲领。
    在共产党和苏维埃国家的创造人乌·伊·列宁逝世之后，约·维·斯大林和列宁的其他学生就领导着我们的党努力奋斗，以实现列宁的遗训。党和人民的敌人——托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子、资产阶级民族主义者，力图使党和国家离开列宁的道路，散布对工人阶级和农民的力量的不信任，否认在我国建成社会主义的可能性。共产党在以列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，粉碎了叛徒和投降主义者，捍卫了列宁主义，勇敢地领导苏维埃人民走上在我国进行伟大的社会主义改造的道路。在战前几个五年计划的年代里，苏联人民实现了列宁的关于社会主义建设的纲领，胜利地实现了国家工业化和农业集体化，建成了社会主义社会，根本地改善了劳动人民的物质状况，提高了劳动人民的文化水平。
    共产党始终不渝地执行列宁的遗训，不倦地巩固工农联盟和苏联各族人民的友谊——苏维埃国家巩固和强大的基础。
    在我国确立的苏维埃社会制度和国家制度，在反对德国法西斯侵略者的卫国战争年代里，表现了伟大的、不可战胜的力量。由于苏维埃国家的强大和共产党的英明领导，由于苏联人民的奋不顾身的英雄精神，我国人民击败了法西斯侵略者，获得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，保卫了自己祖国的自由和独立。德、日法西斯侵略者的被击溃，为建立由苏联和欧洲与亚洲人民民主国家这些爱好和平国家组成的不可战胜的阵营创造了条件。苏联人民的这一切伟大的胜利都是和斯大林的名字不可分地联系着的，他在战争年代里，领导着国防委员会和苏联军队。
    约·维·斯大林是杰出的创造性的马克思主义理论家。斯大林总结了苏联社会主义建设的极其丰富的经验和现代国际解放运动的经验，创造性地发展了马克思—列宁的学说，把它运用到新的历史条件中，并在许多问题上以新的原理丰富了革命理论。
    共产党的全部活动都是遵循伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的。党许多年来所制订的政策都以马克思列宁主义的巩固的理论基础为依据，反映了人民的根本利益。苏联人民对自己的亲爱的共产党表示无限的信任和热烈的爱戴，这是因为为劳动人民服务是党的活动的最高准则。在共产党的领导下，苏联人民满怀信心地前进，走向我国建设共产主义的新胜利。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，完成了第四个五年计划，现在又不惜一切力量和劳动，为实现第五个五年计划的任务而奋斗。党力求不停地发展整个社会的生产，从而进一步不断增进人民的福利，充分满足人民的日益增长的物质和文化的需求。
    党不倦地关心进一步发展重工业，因为重工业过去是，而且一直是社会主义经济繁荣的基础。我国已经建立起来了的强大的重工业，是加速发展轻工业和食品工业的稳固基础。苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议，以及党和政府随后所采取的关于农业问题的决议，为迅速发展农业生产的各部门订出了具体的纲领。党和政府特别重视进一步发展谷物生产，因为要发展农业的其他一切部门，要满足居民和整个国民经济的日益增长的需要，都有赖于发展谷物生产的成就。
    保证在我国胜利建成共产主义的最重要的条件是，不断加强苏维埃社会主义国家的力量。共产党将继续不断地竭力巩固苏维埃国家，巩固苏维埃国家力量的基础——工农联盟，巩固我们伟大的多民族的祖国的各族人民的友谊。
    列宁主义教导我们，党的队伍的钢铁般的统一和坚如磐石的团结，是保证党的巩固和强大的主要条件，是保证党成功地起着作为苏联人民的指导和领导力量这一作用的主要条件。斯大林的伟大的功绩在于他为我们党的队伍的统一，为加强党的战斗力进行了不懈的斗争。我们党始终像保护眼珠一样保护着自己的统一，不断发展党内民主，严格地遵守久经考验的列宁的集体领导的原则，培养共产党员成为实现党的政策和决议的积极的政治战士，以及进一步巩固党和群众的联系。
    目前正在进行的苏联最高苏维埃选举运动，明显地显示了党和人民的不可分割的联系，显示了共产党与非党人民联盟的不可摧毁的力量，斯大林就是把这个联盟称为我国自然而富有生命的事情。我们的一切胜利的源泉就在于党、政府和人民的伟大团结。
    苏维埃国家在共产党的领导下始终不渝地执行和平外交政策，这个政策的原则就是由列宁所制订、而由斯大林坚持不懈地付诸实施的。苏联的和平外交政策是从列宁和斯大林关于两个不同的制度——资本主义制度和社会主义制度——有可能长期共处并和平竞赛的原理出发的。共产党和苏联全体人民认为他们神圣的义务就是，保卫和平事业、保卫和巩固各国人民的最伟大的成就——和平、民主和社会主义阵营，巩固与中国人民、与所有人民民主国家劳动人民的永恒的兄弟友谊联系。
    在伟大的、战无不胜的马克思—列宁学说的旗帜下，在共产党的领导下，苏联人民满怀信心地朝着光辉的共产主义高峰前进。人民民主国家的劳动人民也在这面旗帜下坚定地沿着社会主义建设的道路前进。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林思想的光辉照耀着全世界人民走向自由和幸福的道路。
