　　The Battle to Assault "256" Heights
    ——A Record of Liu Wanshu, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Bai Sheng
    It was still the early days of the Korean War, on the morning of July 14, 1950. As the heroic Korean People's Army pursued the fleeing American-Syngman Rhee bandit troops to Gyeongsangbuk-do, they suddenly encountered the enemy's strong defensive positions on their advance. The enemy resisting here at the time was the so-called "Tiger Division" of the ROK Army's 23rd and 22nd Regiments, entrenched near the advantageous 256 Heights. This high ground was essential for the People's Army to liberate Yeonghae and Yeongdeok, and also the main route for the enemy to retreat towards Busan. Therefore, occupying 256 Heights was of great significance for pursuing and eliminating the retreating enemy. After studying the enemy's situation, the People's Army headquarters immediately assigned the important task of breaking through and destroying the enemy on 256 Heights to the vanguard Li Longwan Company. The political deputy company commander (political instructor) of this company was the young hero Liu Wanshu. After receiving this order, Company Commander Li Longwan and Liu Wanshu immediately led all the company's warriors to launch a tentative attack on the heights. Under the fierce cover of mortars, they bravely and resourcefully rushed forward. When they were about to approach the heights, more than 800 enemies hiding in the middle of the heights suddenly opened fire on them. A fierce battle began. Soon, enemies from other defensive positions also came to reinforce them, concentrating their forces and firepower on the company. Because of the lack of ammunition and the small number of men, Liu Wanshu and his company were temporarily blocked by the enemy's firepower. The situation was very tense. At this time, Company Commander Li Longwan, at the request of the soldiers, immediately organized an assault team, with Liu Wanshu courageously taking the lead. Under the cover of artillery fire, they used the terrain to quickly rush towards the high ground. They threw grenades at the places where the enemy was firing, destroying the enemy's machine guns, and the stubborn enemies fell. Finally, the assault team rushed to the 256 Heights. But in this short moment of rushing to the high ground, the frantic enemy counterattacked, but were repelled time and time again by the assault team. From 9:00 in the morning until 5:00 in the afternoon, they repelled the enemy's counterattacks thirteen times in a row. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. In the end, only four warriors of the assault team remained: Company Commander Li Longwan, Liu Wanshu, and two other soldiers. Company Commander Li Longwan also suffered a serious injury to his right arm and could not move. However, the enemy continued to counterattack, and the situation became increasingly serious. But when they thought of the orders from their superiors, and that all their brothers were waiting for them to take this high ground, they gained infinite strength. They solemnly swore to the Party and to the leader Kim Il-sung: "Even if we sacrifice here, we will never give up the high ground." They had already envisioned the worst-case scenario. They solemnly took out their Labor Party membership cards and buried them in the ground, preparing for a life-and-death struggle with the enemy. Seeing that the enemy was about to rush up, Liu Wanshu shouted battle slogans, and he and his comrades-in-arms fired their machine guns at the enemy, who were actually stunned for a moment, and a group of enemies quickly retreated. At the most critical moment of this battle, reinforcements sent by the brigade headquarters arrived to support the company. The 256 Heights were held. On this high ground, the enemy left 331 corpses. After this victorious battle, Liu Wanshu and his three comrades-in-arms were all awarded the title of Hero of the Republic.
    This young hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is only twenty-six years old this year. He is now an excellent political deputy battalion commander in a certain unit of the Korean People's Army. This time, he participated in the Korean People's Delegation to China, and has a deeper feeling than other delegates, because although his hometown is in Gangwon Province of Korea, he grew up in Northeast China. His parents moved from Korea to Yanbian in Northeast China very early in order to get rid of the bullying and oppression of the Japanese invaders. In 1945, when the Soviet Red Army liberated North Korea on "August 15th", Liu Wanshu returned to Korea with the enthusiasm of dedicating his youth to the motherland. Soon, he joined the Korean People's Army. As soon as the Korean War broke out, he went to the front line and fought for more than three years for the independence and freedom of his motherland, for the safety of China, and for peace in the Far East.
    Today, he has come to the land of China again. How kind and familiar this land is to him! When the Chinese loved ones embraced him tightly, he could no longer restrain his excited feelings. He felt as if he had returned to his long-lost hometown. (Attached picture)

　　突击“二五六”高地的战斗
    ——记朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄柳万洙
    柏生
    那还是朝鲜战争的初期，一九五○年七月十四日的早晨，当英雄的朝鲜人民军部队追歼美李匪军至庆尚北道时，在前进的道路上，突然遇到了敌人强固的防御阵地。当时在这里抗击的敌人是所谓“猛虎部队”的李伪军二十三联队和二十二联队，他们盘踞在有利的二五六高地附近。这个高地是人民军解放宁海、盈德的必经之地，也是敌人退向釜山方面的主要通道。因此占领二五六高地，对追歼溃退中的敌人，有着非常重要的意义。人民军指挥所在研究了敌人的情况以后，立刻把突破和消灭二五六高地敌人的重大任务交给了这支部队的前锋李龙完中队。这个中队的政治副中队长（政治指导员）就是年青的英雄柳万洙。李龙完中队长和柳万洙接到这个命令以后，立即率领全中队的勇士，开始向高地进行试探性的进攻。在迫击炮的猛烈掩护下，他们勇敢机智地向前冲去，当他们快接近高地时，隐避在高地中间的八百多名敌人突然向他们射击起来。一场激烈的战斗开始了。很快别的防御阵地上的敌人也向这里增援来了，兵力和炮火，集中向中队射击。而柳万洙他们这个中队因弹药缺乏，人数又少，一时被敌人的火力拦阻住了。情况非常紧张，这时中队长李龙完在战士们的恳请下，立即组织了一个突击队，柳万洙英勇地担任了突击队的先锋。他们在炮火的掩护下利用地形迅速地向着高地冲去。他们把手榴弹对准敌人发射火力的地方扔去，敌人的机枪被炸毁了，顽抗的敌人倒下去了。终于，突击队冲上了二五六高地。但就在冲上高地的这短短的时刻里，疯狂的敌人又反扑上来，但一次一次地都被突击队打了下去，从早晨九点钟一直进行到下午五点钟，一连打退了敌人十三次这样的反扑，敌人伤亡很大，最后，突击队的勇士们也只剩下四个人了：中队长李龙完、柳万洙，还有其他两个战士。中队长李龙完右臂也负了重伤，不能移动，可是敌人还在继续反扑，情况是愈来愈严重了。但是，当他们想到上级的命令，想到所有兄弟们都在等待着他们拿下这个高地时，他们就增加了无限的力量，他们庄严地向党向领袖金日成宣誓：“就是牺牲在这里，也决不放弃高地。”他们已经设想了最坏的情况，他们严肃地拿出劳动党的党证把它埋在地下，准备和敌人做生死的搏斗。眼看敌人就要冲上来了，这时，柳万洙高喊起战斗的口号，他和战友们并连发机枪向敌人扫射，敌人竟真的一时被吓住了，一股敌人迅速退了下去。正在这个战斗最紧张的时刻，大队部派来支援中队的队伍赶到了，二五六高地被坚持下来了，在这个高地上面，敌人丢下了三百三十一具尸体。这次胜利的战斗结束以后，柳万洙和他的三位战友都得到了共和国英雄的称号。
    这位年青的朝鲜共和国英雄今年才只有二十六岁，他现在是朝鲜人民军某部的一位优秀的政治副大队长。这次他参加朝鲜人民访华代表团来到中国，比其他代表有着更深一层的感触。因为他的家乡虽然在朝鲜的江原道，但他却生长在中国的东北。他的父母为了摆脱日寇的欺凌和压迫，很早便从朝鲜迁居到了我国东北的延边地方。一九四五年“八、一五”苏联红军解放了北朝鲜时，柳万洙才怀着把青春献给祖国的热情回到了朝鲜，不久，他即参加了朝鲜人民军。朝鲜战争刚一爆发，他就上了前线，为了祖国的独立和自由，为了中国的安全和远东的和平战斗了三年多。
    今天，他又来到了中国的土地上，这土地对他是多么亲切多么熟悉啊！当中国的亲人们把他紧紧拥抱在怀里的时候，他再也抑制不住那激动的感情，他仿佛又回到了自己久别的故乡一样。（附图片）
