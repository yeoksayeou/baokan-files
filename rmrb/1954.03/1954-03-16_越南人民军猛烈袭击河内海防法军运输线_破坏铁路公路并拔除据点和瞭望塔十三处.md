Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army, operating deep behind enemy lines in the Red River Delta, launched a series of offensives against a 70-kilometer section of the French army's defense system along Route 5 between Hanoi and Haiphong, starting on March 11th. Preliminary reports indicate that the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated thirteen enemy strongholds and watchtowers, including the following strongholds: Dinh Du, 20 kilometers from Hanoi; An Binh, Gu Yong, Pham Xa, and Quynh Khe, located 10 to 16 kilometers northeast of the capital of Hai Duong province. In addition, the Vietnamese People's Army also destroyed many bridges and sections of highways, and cut off the railway in many places.

Route 5 is one of the enemy's important strategic transportation lines in North Vietnam, and is an important road for transporting American weapons from the port of Haiphong to Hanoi to supply the French colonialists. The enemy has strengthened its defenses along this highway, especially after the Vietnamese People's Army recently destroyed a French military train in Pham Xa, killing and wounding more than 900 European and African soldiers, and destroyed 18 French military aircraft at the Gia Lam airport on this highway. The People's Army's move to eliminate thirteen enemy strongholds and watchtowers and destroy several sections of highways and railways has created more difficulties for the French colonialists' transportation efforts.

Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: The Vietnamese People's Army's fierce attack on the French army's transportation lines from Hanoi to Haiphong has struck a blow at the transportation of war materials supplied by the United States from Haiphong to Hanoi, the center of the French army in North Vietnam.

According to the Associated Press, on the evening of the 12th, the Vietnamese People's Army "broke into the heart of the Red River Delta with irresistible force and blew up five sections of the railway line connecting Hanoi and Haiphong. They also blew up bridges along the way, and captured, burned, or destroyed many watchtowers and small bunkers." At the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army also attacked and destroyed Route 5, which runs parallel to the railway.

The Associated Press said: "This battle has almost spread to the suburbs of Hanoi." The Vietnamese People's Army "fired fiercely at French tanks, armored vehicles, and mobile artillery with mortars, machine guns, and rifles." "This artillery fire is one of the most intense in the eight-year war." French authorities admitted that under the fierce artillery fire of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army "was forced to abandon some strongholds." United Press International revealed that the Hanoi-Haiphong railway, which was attacked, was still unable to operate as of the 14th.

United Press International said that Route 5 was considered by the French invading forces in Vietnam to be its "main artery in the Red River Delta," and "this highway has long been considered the most heavily guarded highway among the important highways of the French Federation." Since the United States intensified its intervention in the Indochina War, Haiphong has increasingly become the port for importing most of the American war materials invested in the Indochina War. These materials are transported from Haiphong to Hanoi via Route 5 and the railway parallel to it. The Associated Press said that about 6,000 French military supply trucks travel on Route 5 every day.

    越南人民军猛烈袭击河内海防法军运输线
    破坏铁路公路并拔除据点和瞭望塔十三处
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：深入红河三角洲敌后地区的越南人民军，从三月十一日起对河内海防间的第五号公路上的一段七十公里长的法军防御体系发动了一连串的进攻。据初步消息，越南人民军拔除了敌军据点和瞭望塔十三处，其中包括下列据点：距河内二十公里的定游，位于海阳省省会东北十到十六公里的安平、鼓勇、范舍、琼溪。此外，越南人民军还破坏了许多桥梁和部分公路，并在许多地方切断了铁路。
    第五号公路是敌人在北越的重要战略交通线之一，并且是把美国武器从海防港口运到河内供应法国殖民者的一条重要道路。敌人已在这条公路上加强了防御，特别是在越南人民军最近在范舍击毁了一列法军火车，毙、伤其中的九百多名欧非籍士兵和在这条公路上的嘉林机场摧毁了十八架法军飞机之后，人民军在这条公路拔除敌军据点和瞭望塔十三处并破坏了数段公路、铁路的举动，给法国殖民者的运输工作造成了更多的困难。
    【新华社十五日讯】越南人民军猛烈进攻法军从河内到海防的运输线，打击了美国供应的战争物资从海防向北越法军中心河内的输送工作。
    据美联社透露，越南人民军在十二日晚上“以破竹之势突入红河三角洲心脏地带，把衔接河内与海防的铁路干线爆破了五处。他们还把沿路的桥梁炸毁，把许多瞭望塔和小碉堡也给攻陷、烧毁或捣毁了”。同时，越南人民军并袭击和破坏了与这条铁路平行的第五号公路。
    美联社说：“这次战斗差不多蔓延到河内近郊。”越南人民军“以猛烈的迫击炮、机枪和步枪射击法军坦克、装甲车和机动炮”，“这次炮火是八年战争中最激烈的炮火之一”。法军当局承认，在越南人民军的猛烈炮火下，法军“被迫放弃某些据点”。合众社透露，被袭击的河内—海防铁路，截至十四日还未能通车。
    合众社说，第五号公路被侵越法军认为是它在“红河三角洲的要道”，并且“这条公路长久以来都被认为是法兰西联邦的重要公路中守备最严的公路”。自从美国加紧干预印度支那战争以来，海防日益成为输入大部分美国投入印度支那战争的军需物资的港口。这些物资就是经过第五号公路和与它平行的铁路从海防运送到河内。美联社说，每天行驶在第五号公路上的法军供应卡车达六千辆左右。
