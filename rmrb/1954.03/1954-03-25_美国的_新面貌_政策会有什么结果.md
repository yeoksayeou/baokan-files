What will be the results of the US "New Look" policy?
Wu Quan

Recently, leading figures in the US government have been frequently and publicly discussing their so-called "New Look" strategic plan. US Secretary of State Dulles has repeatedly spoken about this strategic plan in the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, press conferences, and the "Foreign Affairs" journal. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford and other military officials have also greatly spread war hysteria. Even US President Eisenhower has stated that in certain circumstances, the president can take military action immediately without congressional approval.

According to the propaganda of these US government leaders, their so-called "New Look" strategy includes the following: First, to attack "by means of their own choosing, at times and places of their own choosing," according to the American military adventurers; second, to implement so-called "big atomic air force-ism," relying on the air force and "new weapons" "not only for strategic purposes, but also for tactical purposes," which is to conquer other countries and create bloodshed and suffering for peaceful residents; third, to organize military blocs, promote the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and US-Japan, US-South Korea (Syngman Rhee), US-Philippines and other military treaties, urge the "European Defense Community" to be established quickly, praise the "Turkey-Pakistan agreement as marking the beginning of the application of this concept of collective security in the Middle East," and want the United Nations to also "move in this direction"; fourth, its allies should contribute economically and culturally in addition to bearing military obligations, of course including independent sovereignty, and even "those areas that have not undertaken obligations" should be under the control of the United States, so that they are "significant" to the "security" of the United States. At the same time, the United States will continue to maintain a large number of troops in Asia and Europe, expand military bases, to support the "forward strategy."

Therefore, this "New Look" policy, which thoroughly exposes the belligerent and aggressive US ruling group, is clearly aimed at dominating the fate of all countries and seeking world hegemony.

The proponents of the "New Look" policy regard this policy as the foundation of American foreign policy. They frankly state that American foreign policy is still "based on strength." It is very clear that the so-called "New Look" policy is actually the "policy of strength" that the United States has always pursued. Eisenhower admitted: "It is incorrect to say that the American strategic principle called 'New Look' is something new."

But why are the US ruling groups so enthusiastic about publicizing this "New Look" policy now? The Berlin Conference has just been held, and it has achieved two major agreements on the issues of great power consultation and disarmament. World opinion generally believes that the Berlin Conference and its agreements demonstrate that great power consultation is possible and necessary; the international situation has just eased somewhat, and people hope to further ease it. At this time, every country that agreed to the two agreements at the Berlin Conference has an obligation to promote the convening of the Geneva Conference as scheduled and to resolve the most pressing international issues – the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and at the same time to try to reach an agreement on the issue of disarmament, or at least on a substantial reduction of armaments. However, the US ruling group just at this time shouted loudly about their "New Look" policy, which can only indicate that they are dissatisfied with the agreements of the Berlin Conference and attempt to undermine the Geneva Conference in order to maintain international tensions, and there can be no other explanation.

Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, while clamoring about the "New Look" strategy, has vigorously advocated intervention in the Indochina War, to keep France trapped in the quagmire of colonial war. He said: "We are supplying the French with military equipment and technical assistance. Our purpose in doing so is to hope that the French and the Federal States (referring to the Indochinese puppet regime) can carry out more and more military operations." At the same time, Radford also expressed that the United States would be unwilling to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. He said that the Korean armistice "is a disturbing truce. We have a truce, not peace"; he said, "There is probably no peace in Korea." This more nakedly reveals the vicious conspiracy of the US ruling group to continue to create tension.

Dulles has repeatedly claimed that the "central goal" of American foreign policy "is to achieve a peace with freedom and security," which seems to sound very good. But how can achieving such a peace be reconciled with the path of hostility and war? Since freedom is to be respected, the independence, sovereignty and right to exist of other countries should be respected; since security is to be guaranteed, other countries should be guaranteed against the danger of aggression or being involved in war. According to this principle, all countries (regardless of their size or what kind of social system they belong to) should coexist peacefully and work together to seek collective security and eliminate the current state of division in the world, rather than engage in an arms race and deepen the division of the world. However, when the US ruling group advocated the "New Look" policy, it nakedly stated that their "New Look" policy was based on the US military and political domination of the entire capitalist world, using the manpower and resources of the countries it controls to serve the war. How can this be said to be for "achieving a peace with freedom and security"?

The proponents of the "New Look" policy explain that this policy is a "long-term plan" used to develop so-called "defensive forces." They want to make countries prepared to endure ten, twenty or even longer periods of tension, and establish "a strong military posture" in the "long period" of the "Cold War." People know that the burden of arms expansion and war preparations that the United States is currently imposing on its "allies" has already made them unbearable; to ask them to continue to bear long-term military expenses will only mean greater fiscal deficits and economic decline, and greater dependence on the United States, except to benefit American arms manufacturers to continue to obtain maximum profits.

Under these circumstances, Dulles repeatedly asks Western European countries to "sincerely" "provide a harmonious and unified defense core." At a glance, it can be seen that Dulles is putting pressure on France. Because the French government has not yet taken action on the issue of ratifying the "European Army" treaty in accordance with the "timetable" recently revealed by the United States to France.

It can be seen that the US ruling group's stepping up the promotion of the "New Look" policy originally contains such a wide range of practical intentions.

However, historical experience has proven that the "policy of strength" will not achieve anything, it is bound to cause resistance, and the strength of this resistance is often even greater, causing the aggressor to bear all the serious consequences. Under the current balance of power in international relations and under the conditions of modern military technology, the consequences of implementing the "policy of strength" will be even more dangerous for adventurers. Dulles also admitted that the United States has no fundamental advantage in any aspect of engaging in war adventures, and the era of relying on geographical conditions to protect its own territory from war in the past two world wars is also over.

The proponents of the "New Look" policy place their hopes on the air force and a certain weapon, which is a decidedly bankrupt military theory. In World War II, Douhet's doctrine of air power omnipotence and Hitler's "blitzkrieg" all ended in miserable defeat. Now, whoever wants to inherit the mantle of fascist military theory will not have a better fate.

The peace forces of the whole world are developing powerfully on an unprecedented scale in history, and the people have the power to stop the war. The US ruling group is trying its best to use other people's hands to wage war on the territory of other countries, which is not only opposed by the people of these countries, but even the ruling class figures of these countries are increasingly clearly aware that it is too dangerous to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. It is completely understandable that the "New Look" policy has caused anxiety and unease in Britain, France and other Western countries.

The obvious fact at present is that the US "policy of strength" has run into snags in all aspects and in all places. This policy has not brought it any glory, and the encirclement plan implemented against the peaceful democratic camp has not brought it any benefits. The "policy of strength" has created the United States' huge military budget and fiscal deficit, resulting in a heavy tax burden and the impoverishment of the people, and it has proved that it cannot save the US economic crisis. As the people oppose this war policy, the political crises of capitalist countries have generally deepened. The advocates of the "policy of strength" have created insurmountable difficulties for themselves. In Asia, the US "policy of strength" has not only suffered serious blows politically and economically, but also suffered a disastrous defeat militarily. The outcome of the Korean War is clear proof. In Europe, the United States' conspiracy to force France to ratify the "European Army" treaty and continue the Indochina War has also encountered great difficulties. Now, the US ruling group once again wants to use the intimidation policy of the "New Look" to create tensions, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, and control its allies and other countries politically, economically and militarily. It is not difficult to imagine what the outcome will be.

The movement calling for easing international tensions has become the broadest and most powerful force in the world today. The only way is to improve relations between countries based on the rights and interests of all countries and to resolve international disputes through consultation.

    美国的“新面貌”政策会有什么结果
    吴全
    最近以来，美国政府的首脑人物频繁地公开谈论着他们的所谓“新面貌”的战略计划。美国国务卿杜勒斯连续在美国参议院外交委员会、记者招待会和“外交季刊”上反复地说到这个战略计划。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福和其他军事负责人员也大事散布战争歇斯底里。甚至美国总统艾森豪威尔也声言在某种情况下，总统可以不必经过国会的批准，立即采取军事行动。
    根据这些美国政府首脑人物的宣传，他们的所谓“新面貌”战略，包括这样的几个内容：第一是照美国的军事冒险家们“所选择的手段，在所选择的时间和地点”进行攻击；第二是实行所谓“大原子空军主义”，依靠空军和“新武器”，来“不仅用于战略目的，而且也要用于战术目的”，那就是要征服别的国家，要制造和平居民的流血和痛苦；第三是组织军事集团，鼓吹北大西洋侵略集团及美日、美李（承晚）、美菲等军事条约，催促“欧洲防务集团”赶快建立，赞扬“土耳其——巴基斯坦协定标志着在中东应用这种集体安全概念的开端”，并要联合国也“朝着这个方向前进”；第四是要它的盟国除了负担军事义务以外，还要贡献经济与文化，当然包括独立主权在内，甚至“那些没有承担义务的地区”也要处在美国的控制之下，以便对美国的“安全”“具有意义”。同时，美国则继续在亚洲和欧洲保持大量军队，扩展军事基地，以支持
  “前进战略”。
    因此，这种彻头彻尾地暴露了好战与侵略性的美国统治集团的“新面貌”政策，其目的显然是想要支配所有国家的命运，称霸世界。
    “新面貌”政策的鼓吹者，把这个政策看做美国外交政策的基础。他们坦率地表明美国的外交政策依然是“从实力出发的”。这就很明白，所谓
  “新面貌”政策实际上就是美国一贯奉行的“实力政策”。艾森豪威尔就承认：“有人说名叫‘新面貌’的美国战略原则是新的东西，这种说法是不正确的。”
    但是，为什么现在美国统治集团要如此热中于宣传这种“新面貌”的政策呢？柏林会议刚刚举行过，并已在大国协商问题和裁减军备问题上获得了两项重大的协议。世界舆论都普遍认为柏林会议及其协议说明了大国的协商是可能的，而且是必要的；国际局势刚刚有了一些缓和，人们都希望进一步使它缓下来。在这个时候，每一个在柏林会议上同意了两项协议的国家，都有义务来促使日内瓦会议如期召开并解决当前最尖锐的国际问题——朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题，同时设法就裁军问题、或至少就大量裁减军备问题取得协议。可是美国统治集团恰恰在这个时候来大叫大嚷他们的“新面貌”政策，这除了表明他们不满意于柏林会议的协议，并企图破坏日内瓦会议，以保持国际紧张局势以外，是不可能有另外的任何解释的。
    美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，在他叫嚣
  “新面貌”战略时，就竭力鼓吹干涉印度支那战争，要把法国继续陷在殖民战争的困境中。他说：
  “我们正在供给法国人以军事装备和技术援助。我们这样做的目的是希望法国人和联邦国家（指印度支那傀儡政权）能够进行愈来愈多的军事行动”。同时，雷德福对朝鲜问题也表示了美国将不愿谋求和平解决。他说朝鲜的停战“是一个令人担心的停战。我们有了一个休战，那不是和平”；他说“在朝鲜大约是不会有和平的。”这更露骨地表示了美国统治集团继续制造紧张的恶毒阴谋。
    杜勒斯一再声称美国外交政策的“中心目标是实现有着自由与安全的和平”，这似乎是很好听的。但是，实现这样的和平，和敌对与战争的途径怎么能够相调和呢？既然要尊重自由，就应该尊重他国的独立主权与生存权利；既然要保障安全，就应该保证他国不受侵略或被卷入战争的危险。根据这个原则，各国（不论是大小民族或属于那一种社会制度）都应和平共处，并共同努力来谋求集体的安全，消除目前世界的分裂状态，而不应从事于备战竞赛，加深世界的分裂。可是，美国统治集团鼓吹“新面貌”政策时，露骨地说明了他们的“新面貌”的政策，却是建立在美国对整个资本主义世界的军事、政治的支配的基础之上，利用它所控制的各国的人力与资源来为战争服务。这又怎么能说是为了“实现有着自由与安全的和平”呢？
    “新面貌”政策的鼓吹者们解释说，这个政策是用来发展所谓“防御力量”的“长期计划”。他们要使各国准备忍受十年、二十年以至更长的紧张时期，并在“冷战”的“漫长时期”建立“一种强大的军事态势”。人们知道，目前美国强加于它的“盟友”身上的扩军备战重担，已经使它们忍受不了了；再要它们继续承担长期的军事费用，那除了有利于美国军火制造家们继续获得最大利润以外，对这些国家只能意味着更大的财政赤字和经济衰落，更加依赖于美国。
    在这种情况之下，杜勒斯口口声声要西欧国家“诚意”地“提供一个融洽的统一防务的核心”。一眼就能看穿，杜勒斯是在对法国施加压力。因为法国政府到现在还没有依照最近被揭露的美国交给法国的“时间表”，对批准“欧洲军”条约问题采取行动。
    这就可见美国统治集团加紧鼓吹“新面貌”政策，原来是包含着如此广泛的实际意图的。
    但是，历史的经验证明，“实力政策”不会有所成就，它势必引起反抗，这种反抗的力量往往更为强大，使侵略者承担一切严重的后果。在目前国际关系的力量对比下，在现代军事技术的条件下，实行“实力政策”的结局将是对冒险者更为危险的了。杜勒斯也承认，美国从事战争冒险的任何方面的优势都是根本不存在的，在过去的两次世界大战中依靠地理条件使自己的国土免受战祸的时代也已经过去了。
    “新面貌”政策的鼓吹者把希望寄托于空军和某一种武器，这是确定地破产了的军事理论。在第二次世界大战中，鼓吹空军万能的杜黑主义和希特勒的“闪电攻击”统统归于惨败了。现在谁要继承法西斯军事理论的衣钵，它的命运更不会好一些。
    全世界的和平力量正在以历史上空前未有的规模强大地发展着，人民有力量来制止战争。美国统治集团竭力想要假他人之手在他国土地上进行战争，不仅遭到这些国家人民的反对，而且连这些国家的统治阶级人士也越来越清醒地看到为美国火中取栗是太危险了。“新面貌”政策引起了英国、法国和其他西方国家的焦虑不安，是完全可以理解的。
    目前明显的事实是，美国的“实力政策”在各个方面和各个地方都碰了壁。这个政策并没有给它带来什么光彩，对和平民主阵营所实行的包围计划并没有给它带来什么好处。“实力政策”造成了美国庞大的军事预算和财政赤字，造成了沉重的赋税负担和人民的贫困化，结果证明它并不能挽救美国的经济危机。由于人民反对这种战争政策，资本主义国家的政治危机更是普遍加深了。“实力政策”的倡导者已给自己造成不可克服的困难。在亚洲，美国的“实力政策”不仅在政治上和经济上遭到严重打击，而且在军事上也遭到了惨败。朝鲜战争的结局就是明证。在欧洲，美国强迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约并继续进行印度支那战争的阴谋，也遭到了很大的困难。现在，美国统治集团再一次想用
  “新面貌”的恫吓政策来制造紧张局势，到处干涉别国的内政，在政治上、经济上和军事上控制它的盟国和其他国家，这究竟会有什么结果是不难想见的。
    要求缓和国际紧张局势的运动，已经成为今日世界上最广泛和最强大的力量。唯一的道路，是根据各国的权利和利益，来改善各国的关系，用协商方式解决国际争端。
