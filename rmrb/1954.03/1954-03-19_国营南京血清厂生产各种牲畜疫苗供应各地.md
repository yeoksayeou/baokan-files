    State-Run Nanjing Serum Factory produces various livestock vaccines, supplying them to farmers and livestock breeding departments in many areas for livestock epidemic prevention injections. This year, the factory has shipped more than 8,300 liters of serum and vaccines to over twenty regions including Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and Inner Mongolia. Among them, anthrax spore vaccine is sufficient for injecting three million head of cattle, and anti-swine fever and other vaccines are sufficient for injecting 1.5 million pigs. In order to enable farmers in remote areas such as Xinjiang and Yunnan to conduct immunization injections for livestock before spring plowing, the Nanjing Serum Factory staff packed the vaccines in sturdy and lightweight small boxes for easy air transportation. The vaccines shipped to various regions have undergone strict inspection before leaving the factory and have strong immunity. At the same time, because the factory has improved its technology and increased production, the average cost of various vaccines has decreased by more than 17% compared to last year.
    The livestock vaccines produced by the Nanjing Serum Factory have strong immunity. Last year, more than 160,000 head of cattle were injected with anthrax spore vaccine in various parts of Jiangsu, of which more than 99% grew very well. Last year, after farmers in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province injected pigs with swine erysipelas bacterial solution, the number of sick pigs decreased by 96% compared to the previous year. In the past, the Hunan Food Company's long-distance pig transportation had a mortality rate of up to 60%. Later, after injecting the pigs with serum, the mortality rate dropped to 4%.

    国营南京血清厂生产各种牲畜疫苗供应各地
    国营南京血清厂生产各种牲畜疫苗，供应给许多地方的农民和牲畜饲养部门对牲口进行防疫注射。这个厂今年运往山东、山西、陕西、湖南、广西、内蒙古等二十多个地区的血清、疫苗共有八千三百多公升。其中炭疽芽胞苗可以注射耕牛三百万头，抗猪瘟等疫苗可以注射猪一百五十万头。为了使新疆、云南等边远地区的农民也能在春耕前对牲畜进行免疫注射，南京血清厂职工用坚固轻便的小箱子装疫苗，以便于用飞机运送。运往各地的疫苗出厂时曾经过严格检验，免疫性很强。同时因为该厂改进了技术，产量增加，各种疫苗的成本平均比去年降低百分之十七以上。
    南京血清厂生产的牲畜疫苗免疫性很强。去年江苏各地注射炭疽芽胞苗的耕牛有十六万多头，其中百分之九十九以上生长得很好。江苏省靖江县农民去年给猪子注射猪丹毒菌液以后，猪子生病的数量比前年减少了百分之九十六。湖南食品公司过去长途运猪，死亡率曾达百分之六十，后来给猪注射血清后，死亡率就下降到百分之四。　（新华社）
