    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: Spring planting has begun in the newly reclaimed areas of the eastern and southeastern Soviet Union. Young patriots who volunteered to participate in the reclamation work and local agricultural workers are engaged in intense labor. In the Kazakh Republic, the Kolelev Machine Tractor Station in Kokshetau Oblast plans to reclaim more than 28,000 hectares (each hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of wasteland this year. The station's tractor teams were dispatched to the wasteland, more than 200 kilometers away, a few days ago to begin work. Tractor teams from machine tractor stations throughout the Jambyl Oblast have departed for the reclamation areas, and many tractor teams are exceeding their quotas for wasteland reclamation every day. On the Mirisk Steppe in the Azerbaijan Republic, approximately 100 tractors are reclaiming wasteland. Tractor operators at the Agdzhabedinskiy Machine Tractor Station are exceeding their daily quotas. The Kuliyev team completes 125 percent of its assigned tasks during each work shift. Collective farms have already received nearly 1,000 hectares of reclaimed land from the tractor station.

    The spring planting task in the reclaimed areas of eastern and southeastern Soviet Union this year is arduous. To ensure the victory of spring planting, thorough preparations are being made in the reclamation areas. For example, collective farms and state farms in the Kazakh Republic are preparing to sow wheat on 605,000 hectares of newly reclaimed land and millet on 50,000 hectares of new land this spring. Collective farms across the region have defined their reclamation plans and adjusted land allocations. Land management workers and collective farmers have completed investigations into soil properties and climate conditions. Machine tractor stations are also preparing manpower and machinery for wasteland reclamation and transporting fuel to the cultivated land. In Kustanai Oblast alone, machine tractor stations will establish 500 new tractor teams and detachments, which will transport more than 500 tons of oil to the fields during this spring planting season. Collective farms and state farms in the Altai Krai are preparing to reclaim more than 500,000 hectares of new land for grain sowing this spring. The Krai recently convened a meeting of machine tractor station directors, Communist Party district committee secretaries, and collective farm chairmen to extensively study the spring planting preparations in the reclamation areas.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd: Many Soviet scientists and medical workers are actively participating in the work of the newly reclaimed areas. As early as the autumn of 1953, many scientific research teams departed for the virgin land areas of Siberia, the Kazakh Republic, and other regions to investigate and study local soil and climate conditions in order to organize agricultural production in these areas. These scientific research teams are composed of agronomists, soil scientists, entomologists, machine tractor station directors, and others. The teams are also staffed with land management personnel specializing in land surveying and planning. Nearly 200 land management workers from the central provinces of the Russian Federation alone have gone to the eastern regions. These scientific research teams have now completed various investigations and are formulating plans for wasteland reclamation based on the characteristics of each region. On the 18th, another group of scientists from Moscow departed for the Kazakh Republic to work. They include not only various specialists, but also many members of the Academy of Sciences. In addition to studying the geology and climate of the virgin land areas, they will also study water resources, swamp drainage, and the prevention and control of crop diseases and pests. They will also study and summarize the practical experience of wasteland reclamation and provide practical assistance to local collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations.

    Medical personnel from all over the Soviet Union are also actively serving in the newly reclaimed areas. Many of them arrived in the reclamation areas with the young reclaimers. The Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences has decided to organize two fully equipped teams to work in the Altai Krai and the Kazakh Republic. The Academy of Medical Sciences is also preparing to study the treatment and prevention of endemic diseases in the reclamation areas.

    苏联东部东南部新开垦地区开始紧张春耕
    许多科学家和医生到新区进行勘察和服务
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联东部和东南部开垦地区已经开始春耕。志愿参加开垦工作的青年爱国者和当地的农业劳动者正在进行紧张的劳动。在哈萨克共和国，柯克齐塔夫州的柯列罗夫机器拖拉机站今年要开垦二万八千多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）荒地，该站的拖拉机组在几天以前已出动到二百多公里以外的荒地上去工作。江布尔州各地机器拖拉机站的拖拉机工作组已出发到开垦地区，许多拖拉机工作组每天都超额完成开垦荒地的任务。在阿塞拜疆共和国的米里斯克草原上，约有一百部拖拉机正在开垦荒地。阿格扎别金斯克机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手们每天都超额完成任务。库里耶夫小组在每个工作班的时间内完成任务百分之一百二十五。集体农庄已从该拖拉机站接收了将近一千公顷的已开垦好的土地。
    今年苏联东部和东南部开垦地区的春耕任务是艰巨的。为了保证春耕的胜利，开垦地区已经和正在进行充分的准备工作。例如，哈萨克共和国的集体农庄和国营农场今年春季准备在新开垦的六十万五千公顷的土地上播种小麦，在五万公顷的新地上播种黍。各地集体农庄都确定了自己的开垦计划，调整了土地。土地整理工作者和集体农民已作好了有关土壤性质、气候条件的调查工作。机器拖拉机站也在为开垦荒地准备人力和机器，并把燃料向耕地输送。其中仅库斯坦奈州各机器拖拉机站就要成立五百个新的拖拉机工作队和分队，它们在今年春耕中将向田间运送五百多吨油料。阿尔泰边疆区各集体农庄和国营农场今年春天准备开垦五十万多公顷新地以播种谷物。边疆区最近召开了机器拖拉机站站长、共产党区委会书记和集体农庄主席的会议，广泛研究了开垦地区准备春耕的情况。
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联许多科学和医务工作者积极参加新开垦地区的工作。还在一九五三年秋天，就有许多科学研究工作队出发到西伯利亚、哈萨克共和国等地的处女地带调查和研究当地的土壤和气候情况，以便组织这些地区的农业生产。这些科学研究工作队由农学家、土壤学家、昆虫学家、机器拖拉机站站长等组成。各工作队还配备了许多专门从事土地的勘察和规划工作的土地整理工作人员。单是从俄罗斯联邦中部各州到东部去的土地整理工作人员就将近有二百人。这些科学研究工作队现在已经完成了各种调查工作，正在根据各地的特点编制开垦荒地的计划。十八日，又有一批莫斯科的科学工作者出发到哈萨克共和国去工作。其中不仅有各种专门人员，而且还有许多科学院院士。他们除了研究处女地带的地质和气候外，还要研究水源和沼泽地的排水问题，以及防治农作物病虫害的问题等。他们还将研究和总结开垦荒地的实际经验，并给当地的集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站以实际的帮助。
    苏联各地的医务工作人员也积极到新开垦地区服务。其中就有许多人随同青年开垦者一道到达开垦地区。苏联医学科学院已决定组织两个配备齐全的工作队到阿尔泰边疆区和哈萨克共和国去工作。医学科学院还准备着手研究开垦地区流行疾病的治疗和预防问题。
