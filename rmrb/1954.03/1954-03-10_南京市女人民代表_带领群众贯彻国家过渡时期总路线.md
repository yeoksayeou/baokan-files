    Female People's Representatives of Nanjing
    Lead the Masses in Implementing the General Line of the Transition Period

    The women elected as People's Representatives in the grassroots election movement in Nanjing Municipality are closely connected with the masses and play a role in leading the masses to implement the general line.

    A total of 276 women were elected as People's Representatives of various districts in Nanjing Municipality in the grassroots election movement, accounting for more than 26 percent of the total number of representatives. After being elected as People's Representatives, they demonstrated a high degree of political enthusiasm, extensively collecting opinions from the masses through mass forums, resident newspaper reading groups, or visits, preparing to bring them to the district People's Congress for discussion. Lu Xueqin, a female worker at the Qin Feng Cigarette Factory in the First District, visited nearby voters on Sundays after being elected as a People's Representative to solicit voters' opinions and demands regarding the government's work and to carry out the propaganda work of the general line. Lu Shaozhen, a female People's Representative in the Third District, promoted the general line to voters anytime, anywhere. She said, "The country has a grand construction plan, and each of our families should also have a plan. Everyone should be meticulous and frugal in their lives, which can help the country accumulate funds for industrialization, and socialism will come quickly." In accordance with the spirit of thrift, she drew up a monthly expenditure plan for her family, trying her best not to waste anything. Residents of Chao Ku Street have universally raised their awareness under the promotion of Lu Shaozhen and local grassroots cadres. Now more than 400 households have held family meetings and drawn up family saving plans.

    There are more than 320 women among the People's Representatives of various townships and towns in the suburbs of Nanjing, of which 14 have also been elected as township heads or town heads. They actively promote the benefits of socialism to the masses, take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction, and lead farmers on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Wang Yuzhen, elected as Deputy Township Head, and Xu Xiuying, elected as Deputy Town Head, have both developed their respective mutual aid groups into agricultural production cooperatives.

    南京市女人民代表
    带领群众贯彻国家过渡时期总路线
    在南京市基层选举运动中当选为人民代表的妇女密切联系群众，发挥了带领群众贯彻总路线的作用。
    南京市的妇女在基层选举运动中当选为各区人民代表的共计二百七十六人，占代表总人数的百分之二十六以上。她们当选为人民代表后发挥了高度的政治积极性，通过群众座谈会、居民读报组或访问等形式广泛收集群众意见，准备带到区人民代表大会上讨论。第一区勤丰烟厂女工陆雪琴当选为人民代表后，利用星期日访问附近的选民，征求选民对政府工作的意见和要求，并进行总路线的宣传工作。第三区女人民代表陆绍贞随时随地向选民们宣传总路线。她说：“国家建设有大计划，我们每个家庭也应该有计划，人人精打细算过日子，就可以帮助国家积累工业化的资金，社会主义就来的快了。”她根据节约精神，订出自己家庭的每月开支计划，尽量做到不浪费。钞库街的居民在陆绍贞和当地基层干部的宣传带动下普遍提高了认识，现在已有四百多户人家开了家庭会议，订出家庭节约计划。
    南京市郊区各乡、镇人民代表中有三百二十多个妇女，其中有十四个并当选为乡长或镇长。她们积极向群众宣传社会主义的好处，带头把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设，并带领农民走互助合作的道路。当选副乡长的王玉珍和当选副镇长的徐秀英都把她们自己所在的互助组发展成为农业生产合作社。　（新华社）
