Improve Cultivation Techniques to Increase Spring Wheat Yield Per Unit Area
Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Agricultural Production Bureau

Wheat is an important commercial grain. Increasing the production of spring wheat is an important way to increase the amount of wheat available for sale. This is because the planting area of spring wheat accounts for about 11% of the country's wheat fields, and there is still considerable potential for increased production. As long as cultivation techniques are improved, the yield of spring wheat can be greatly increased. The spring wheat sowing season is approaching, and in order to increase the yield of spring wheat, it is necessary to seize the opportunity to do the following:

(1) Select disease-resistant varieties and prepare seeds properly. Wheat rust is the main reason for the instability and reduction of spring wheat yields over the years. In 1948, the spring wheat in the Northeast region only had a quarter of its harvest due to the prevalence of rust, resulting in a loss of about 5.6 million tons of wheat. In 1950, the average yield of spring wheat in the former Suiyuan Province was only 38 jin per mu due to rust. Severely affected wheat fields even had no harvest at all. The most effective and economical way to prevent spring wheat rust is to select disease-resistant varieties. At present, many disease-resistant and high-yielding varieties have been discovered in various regions, such as "No. 96" spring wheat, which has shown high rust resistance in the spring wheat areas of Northeast, Northwest, Shanxi, Hebei, and former Suiyuan, and has a high yield. According to the test results of Mishan Farm in Songjiang Province last year, when the infection rate of other varieties was above 80%, "No. 96" wheat was not infected at all, and the yield per hectare (15 mu) reached 3,400 jin, while the average yield of farmers was only about 1,000 jin. In addition to "No. 96" wheat, "Ha Series 2370" and "Ha Series 2602" in Songjiang Province, "Ha Series 3197" and "Ha Series 4485" in Heilongjiang Province, Biyu wheat in Ningxia Province, and Changmang wheat in Salachi County, Inner Mongolia, and Dingxingzhai wheat in Shanxi Province also have high rust resistance or tolerance. However, the current number of seeds is very small and far from meeting the needs of mass production. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the selection and breeding of rust-resistant and high-yielding varieties, we must strengthen the breeding and management of existing improved varieties and vigorously promote them according to local conditions.

Stinking smut is also a common and serious disease in spring wheat areas. This disease not only reduces wheat production but also deteriorates the quality of flour. In the past, the incidence rate in individual areas was as high as 90%. In recent years, due to the attention of governments at all levels and the vigorous leadership of the masses in seed soaking and seed mixing, the incidence rate has been declining. For example, in 1952, the incidence rate of 1.6 million mu of spring wheat in Gansu Province decreased from 11% to 3% due to the implementation of seed mixing, increasing wheat production by more than 24.5 million jin. According to a survey of 96 households in three townships in the fourth district of Linze County, Gansu Province, the incidence rate of seed mixing with Ceresan was only 2.48%, while the incidence rate of unmixed seeds was 13.18%. This spring, all regions should strengthen this work on the existing basis to completely eliminate the harm of stinking smut.

(2) Sow early at the right time and promote vernalization. Appropriately advancing the sowing date of spring wheat is also a way to increase yield. In China, spring wheat is generally harvested between mid-July and late August. At this time, the Northeast and North China regions are in the rainy season, which affects the quality and timely harvest of spring wheat. In the Northwest region, there is drought and hot wind at this time, which affects the normal grouting of wheat grains and also causes yield reduction. Early sowing can lead to early maturity, reduce losses, and reduce rust damage. Farmers in Ningxia Province have the saying that "early sowing is better than late fertilization," and farmers in Northeast China have the saying that "sowing on ice, harvesting on fire." According to the experience of Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces, those sown in early April are generally harvested in early August, and those sown in mid-to-late March can mature about a week earlier. When stem rust occurs, the early-sown spring wheat has reached the yellow ripe stage, and the impact on yield is not significant. According to advanced Soviet experience, the temperature of early-sown spring wheat during stem formation and heading is relatively low, so it can increase the seed setting rate of spikelets and increase yield. Since spring wheat requires a lower germination temperature and the cold resistance of seedlings is stronger than that of miscellaneous grains, there is no problem with appropriate early sowing. As long as the ground starts to thaw and can be cultivated, land preparation and sowing can be carried out.

Implementing vernalization can also advance maturity and increase yield. In the Soviet Union, vernalization of spring wheat has become a mass technology. This advanced experience has also been very successful in my country's experiments. According to the spring wheat vernalization experiment of Qiqihar Horticultural Farm in Heilongjiang Province, the vernalized spring wheat has tall stems and fat leaves, grows fast, matures about ten days earlier, and greatly increases yield. However, there is still a lack of practical experience in large-field promotion, which requires efforts from farms in various spring wheat areas in the future.

(3) Appropriately increase planting density and change from broadcasting to row planting. Sparse planting is also one of the important factors limiting the increase in spring wheat yield. In the North China spring wheat area, the row spacing is generally more than 8 or 9 inches to 1 foot, and the seeding rate is about 10 jin per mu. In the Northeast spring wheat area, the ridge planting method is mostly used, with a ridge width of about 2 feet and a seeding rate of 10 to 20 jin per mu. In order to increase the yield of spring wheat, it is necessary to appropriately increase the seeding rate, while reducing the row spacing or widening the sowing width. Because the tillering ability of spring wheat is relatively small, although some tillers can be increased under sparse planting conditions, most of the secondary stems cannot bear spikes, and the total number of spikes is still not large. Especially in the absence of irrigation, the yield mainly depends on the development of the main spike. In order to have enough single plants in a certain area, the seeding rate must be appropriately increased in areas with currently low seeding rates, and the row spacing should be reduced or the sowing width should be widened. In areas where the seeding rate is already above 20 or 30 jin per mu, the main thing is to reduce the row spacing or widen the sowing width to make the seeds evenly distributed and ensure that each wheat plant has a certain nutrient area. It is best to use a new narrow-row drill for dense planting. In areas without new drills, all regions can continue to use the successful methods created to implement dense planting with existing farm tools. For example, in the ridge planting area of Northeast China, there are methods such as one ridge with three seed eyes and one ridge with two seed eyes to increase the number of planting plants, and the seeding rate is also increased to 300 to 400 jin per hectare. In the North China region, there are methods such as changing the plow and using a plow to reduce the row spacing and increase the number of planting rows. The seeding rate has increased to about 20 jin, and significant yield increases have been achieved. All regions should summarize the local experience in dense planting, use local materials, and promote it locally.

In the Northwest region, spring wheat is generally broadcast. Due to rough cultivation, shallow soil cover, and poor seed quality, the seeding rate is as high as 30 jin, but the germination rate is very low. In these areas, it is necessary to educate the masses to change from broadcasting to row planting and strengthen seed selection and seed soaking.

    改进栽培技术，提高春小麦单位面积产量
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
    小麦是一种重要商品食粮，增产春小麦是增加小麦商品额的一个重要途径。这是因为春小麦的播种面积约占全国麦田面积的百分之十一，而且还有较大的增产潜在力量。只要改进栽培技术，春小麦的产量就可以大大提高。现在春小麦的播种季节已快到来，为了提高春小麦的产量，必须抓紧时机做好以下几项工作：
    （一）选用抗病品种，作好种子处理。小麦锈病是造成春小麦历年产量不稳定和减产的主要原因。一九四八年东北区的春小麦因锈病流行，只有四分之一的收成，损失小麦约五百六十万吨；一九五○年前绥远省的春小麦因锈病每亩平均产量只三十八斤，锈病严重的麦田，甚至颗粒无收。防治春小麦锈病最有效和最经济的办法，是选用抗病品种。目前各地已发现不少抗病丰产的品种，如“九十六号”春小麦，在东北、西北及山西、河北和前绥远的春麦区都表现了高度的抗锈性，并且产量很高。据松江省密山农场去年试验结果，其他品种感染病率在百分之八十以上时，“九十六号”小麦却丝毫没有感染，每垧（十五市亩）产量达到三千四百斤，而一般农家种只有一千斤左右。除“九十六号”小麦外，松江省的“哈系二三七○”“哈系二六○二”，黑龙江省的“哈系三一九七”“哈系四四八五”，宁夏省的碧玉麦，内蒙古萨拉齐县的长芒麦，山西省定兴寨小麦等也都具有较高的耐锈或抗锈能力。但目前种子数量都很少，远不能满足群众生产的需要。因此，除要加强抗锈丰产品种的选育工作外，必须加强现有良种的繁殖管理工作，因地制宜地大力推广。
    腥黑穗病也是春麦区普遍而严重的病害。这种病害不仅造成小麦减产，而且可使面粉的品质变劣。过去个别地区发病率有高达百分之九十的，近年来由于各级政府的重视，大力领导群众浸种、拌种，发病率已日趋下降，如一九五二年甘肃省的一百六十万亩春小麦，因实行了拌种，发病率从百分之十一降低到百分之三，增产小麦二千四百五十余万斤。据甘肃省临泽县四区三个乡九十六户的调查，用赛力散拌种的发病率只百分之二点四八，未拌种的发病率为百分之十三点一八。各地今春应在原有基础上加强这一工作，彻底消灭腥黑穗病的为害。
      （二）适期早播，推行春化处理。适当提早春小麦的播种期，也是提高产量的一个办法。我国春小麦一般在七月中、下旬到八月间收获。这时东北区和华北区正当雨季，因此影响春麦的品质和适时收获。西北地区这时又有干旱热风，影响麦粒正常灌浆，也会造成减产。提早播种就可提早成熟，减少损失，并可减轻锈病为害。宁夏省农民有“早种强似晚施肥”，东北农民有“种在冰上，收在火上”的说法。据黑龙江省和松江省的经验，一般四月上旬播种的，八月上旬收获，提早在三月中、下旬播种的，可以早熟一星期左右。当秆锈病发生时，早播的春麦已达黄熟期，对产量的影响即不显著。根据苏联先进经验，早种的春麦在形成茎秆和抽穗时的温度比较低，因此能增加小穗的结实率，提高产量。由于春小麦需要的发芽温度较低，幼苗的耐寒力比杂粮强，适当早播是没有问题的，只要地面开始化冻，可以下地时，就可以整地播种。
    实行春化处理也可提早成熟，增加产量。在苏联春小麦的春化处理已成为群众性的技术。这一先进经验在我国试验也很成功。根据黑龙江省齐齐哈尔园艺场春小麦春化处理的试验，经过春化的春小麦，秆高叶肥，生育快，提早成熟十天左右，大大地增加了产量。但目前还缺乏大田推广的实践经验，这是需要各春麦区的农场今后努力的。
    （三）适当密植，改撒播为条播。稀植也是限制当前春小麦产量提高的重要因素之一。华北春麦区一般行距在八、九寸到一尺以上，播种量每亩在十斤上下，东北春麦区大多实行垅作，垅宽约二尺，播种量每亩十斤至二十斤不等。为了提高春小麦的产量，必须适当增加播种量，同时缩小行距或加宽播幅。由于春小麦的分蘖力较小，在稀植情况下虽也能增加一些分蘖，但次生茎大部不能结穗，总的穗数依然不多。尤其在缺乏灌溉情况下，产量主要取决于主穗的发育。为了使在一定的面积上有足够的单株，目前播种量较少地区，必须适当增加播种量，并缩小行距或加宽播幅。在播种量每亩已在二、三十斤以上地区，主要是缩小行距，或加宽播幅，使种子均匀分布，保证每一麦株有一定营养面积。实行密植最好采用新式窄行条播机。在没有新式播种机地区，各地可以继续使用已创造的用原有农具实行密植的成功方法。如东北垅作地区有一垅三苗眼，一垅双苗眼等方法增加种植株数，播种量亦增加到每垧三百斤至四百斤。华北地区，有改耧、套耧等办法缩小行距增加种植行数。播种量增加到二十斤左右，都获得了显著增产效果。各地应总结当地的密植经验，就地取材，就地推广。
    在西北区春麦一般都是撒播。由于耕作粗放，覆土过浅，再加种子质量低劣等原因，播种量虽高达三十斤，但发芽率却很低。在这类地区，必须教育群众改撒播为条播和加强选种、浸种等工作。
