    Remembering Those Grievous Days Last Year
    Xiao San

    Those days last year, the early part of March 1953, were grievous days that all progressive mankind and all working people on Earth can never forget. During those days, I was bedridden in Moscow. The communiqués in the newspapers and the slow, heavy reports from the broadcasters plunged people into a state of extreme anxiety. People usually shouted "Long live Stalin!" and "Glory to Stalin!" from the bottom of their hearts, but during those days, they shouted "Wishing Stalin health!" with infinite hope. More generally, no one believed, or rather, was unwilling to believe that Stalin was ill, and that the illness was so serious.

    Finally, at 9:50 PM on March 5th, the great Stalin closed his eyes forever and departed from us! This tragic news, like lightning, silently flew to every corner of the earth, entered every dwelling, every family, and sharply pierced the heart of every worker.

    In those days, some people cried secretly alone, and some cried openly in front of many people. Not only ordinary men, women, old people, and children wept bitterly, but even those battle-hardened heroes and soldiers, who had never cried on the battlefield for many years, could not help but shed large tears. They cried because they suddenly lost their loving father, good teacher, close friend, and leader. They cried because their standard-bearer had fallen, and the giant star, the sun, had fallen.

    People loved Stalin, loved his genius, his wisdom, his reason, his steel-like will, his courage, his theories. For those who lived in his time, people loved him as a person, a person who everyone felt was indispensable among us.

    There was no distance between him and us. All workers, peasants, soldiers, engineers, scientists, writers, artists, doctors, teachers... all regarded him as their own relative.

    Due to the practical impossibility, he certainly could not know everyone on earth. But everyone felt that he knew them. Everyone felt that he was a father, a brother, a strict teacher, and a candid friend to them.

    Everyone felt connected to him and sincerely and frankly offered their hearts to him. And the only thing he cared about throughout his life was people—all of us and each individual. His genius and reason, his will and courage, his thoughts and theories, his actions, his policies, his peace policies, his great humanism—everything was for mankind.

    This feeling was usually present, but it was felt even more deeply and intimately during those sorrowful days.

    During those days, people flocked to Moscow from all over the Soviet Union and from countries all over the world to offer condolences. There were so many people that even a city as large as Moscow seemed unable to accommodate them. Here, the crowds going to pay their respects and bid farewell to Stalin surged like floods onto the streets leading to the House of Trade Unions, and the center of the streets seemed to be depressed a little due to the large number of people... Obviously, it was impossible for everyone who wanted to pay their respects to come to Moscow. They, these millions of people, were far from Moscow. But during these days, no matter where they were, in whatever corner, millions of people were looking towards Moscow, towards the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions, under the many red flags flying at half-mast with black ribbons or black borders, in the midst of thousands of green-leaved and colorful wreaths, devoutly looking at Stalin's kind and amiable face, even every wrinkle on his face—either reliving the image they had seen, or imagining it from photographs. They, these millions of people, silently stood beside Stalin's remains, paying him their last respects and bidding him their final farewell.

    And on that day, March 9th, these millions of people, no matter where they were, were in their hearts sending off their loved one, leader, and mentor. They could not, could not believe that this was the last journey of his life. People dragged their heavy, heavy steps, accompanied by the lingering mournful music, sending him to Red Square, to Lenin's Mausoleum... They could not help but be startled and heartbroken, and then painfully admit: a name had been added to the tomb door: Stalin!

    People sent him to Red Square, but could not, could not imagine that today he was not standing on the platform of the mausoleum, as he did every year during the May Day and October holidays, letting people see his kind smile, and he was not waving cordially to the crowds in the square, but he was lying on the platform in front of the mausoleum, without a word...

    When the large clock on the Spassky Tower in Red Square struck twelve, the working people of the whole world consciously used their millions of hands to help lift Stalin's remains into the great mausoleum, and then carefully placed him next to the remains of the great Lenin. At this moment, the salutes of mourning and the wailing of factory, train, and ship sirens were issued and heard all over the world. Millions of workers in factories, farmers in the fields, students in classrooms... all stopped their operations, stood at their posts, and solemnly lowered their heads. People who were walking and trains, cars, and carriages that were moving... all stopped moving. Within five minutes, the whole world was deathly silent. Everyone mourned Stalin in their hearts.

    Since the death of the great Lenin, for nearly thirty years, mankind had not suffered such an unprecedentedly serious and immense loss, and mankind had not felt such profound grief!

    However, Stalin himself set a shining example after Lenin's death. People remembered that after Lenin died in 1924, Stalin suppressed his personal grief and swore before the coffin of his mentor Lenin that he would tirelessly, tirelessly, and unswervingly take up his glorious banner, continue his immortal cause, serve the people to the end, and fight to the end for socialist and communist construction. Remembering those days, people wiped away their tears and raised their heads again. People understood: Stalin was the most humane person, he only liked strong people and did not like weak people.

    So, in these sorrowful days, in factories, in mines, on farms, in hydroelectric power stations, on all construction sites... people worked and created more vigorously and intensely, for the construction of socialism and communism, for the happiness and freedom of people, for world peace—thinking of Stalin in their hearts at all times.

    So, other people, in these sorrowful days, in trenches, on the front lines, also in factories, mines, docks, schools... in legal parliaments, in illegal underground... fought and moved more angrily, more fiercely, and more strongly, for anti-aggression, anti-oppression, for national independence and the liberation and freedom of the people, for world peace—thinking of Stalin in their hearts at all times.

    Stalin had been the inspirer, leader, and mentor of these people and those people during his lifetime. After his death, people could only continue to hold high his banner, the banner of Lenin and Stalin, follow his theories and doctrines, Marxism-Leninism, and move forward along the road he indicated, so people were still filled with confidence and hope.

    "Our task is to transform grief into strength." - This sentence in Comrade Mao Zedong's article "The Greatest Friendship" written for Stalin's death aptly, appropriately, and powerfully expressed what everyone wanted to say in their hearts, and became a great and resounding call that played the greatest encouraging role for everyone.

    People were even more encouraged and increased their confidence after reading the following paragraph:

   "Now that the Soviet Union has reached such strength, the Chinese people's revolution has achieved such a great victory, the construction of the people's democratic countries has made such great achievements, the anti-oppression and anti-aggression movements of the people of all countries in the world have risen to such a height, and our front of friendship and solidarity is so consolidated, it can be completely asserted that we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. Any imperialist aggression will be crushed by us, and all despicable provocations are completely useless." (Mao Zedong: "The Greatest Friendship")

    Look, this is our strength! In order to continue to develop and consolidate this strength, in order to commemorate "the passing away of Comrade Stalin, our most beloved teacher and our most sincere friend," "our entire Party and the people of the whole country will continue to strengthen, with the greatest firmness, our trust and support for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics created by Lenin and Stalin, and consolidate the invincible world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union" (Telegram of Condolence from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union).

    "In order to commemorate our great teacher Stalin, the great friendship between the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, in the name of Stalin, will be infinitely strengthened."

    "Obviously, the power generated by our friendship is endless and truly invincible." (Mao Zedong: "The Greatest Friendship")

    Look, this is our strength! Now it has been a year since those sorrowful days. We must redouble our efforts to develop and consolidate this strength, redouble the strengthening of the unity of the Party and the unity of the people, and steadily move towards socialism.

    From the East, from the West, from all parts of the Earth, the slogan "Transform grief into strength" resounds once again. In order to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of the great Stalin, after the people of all countries in the world silently expressed their condolences, they continued to start their machines, pick up their tools or weapons, open their books... working, creating, and fighting with redoubled efforts to continue to consolidate and develop our strength.

    In the time of labor and struggle, people often feel Stalin's warm caress, and draw heat from him. People feel that Stalin is always alive and is always with us. He is not only with our generation, but also with our descendants forever. People will always be able to hear his voice, no matter where they are, beside roaring machines, on vast lands, in green forests, on azure oceans, in research rooms and classrooms... on the front lines, underground...

    He is always, always with us. Like the historical giants of the past—Marx, Engels, Lenin—Stalin is immortal, just as the light of the sun will never be extinguished.

    记去年那些沉痛的日子
    萧三
    去年那些日子，一九五三年三月上旬，是世界全体进步人类、地球上一切劳动人民永远不能忘记的沉痛的日子。那些日子笔者正卧病在莫斯科。报纸上的公报，广播员的缓慢的沉重的报道，使人们陷入一种极度焦虑的心情。人们平日衷心地高呼“斯大林万岁！”“光荣属于斯大林！”，而这几天里，又怀着无限的希望，喊着“祝斯大林健康！”更普遍的是，谁也不相信，正确些说，不愿意斯大林有病，而且病的那样严重。
    终于，三月五日晚上九点五十分钟，伟大的斯大林永远闭上了他的眼睛，长辞我们去了！这一噩耗，就像闪电似的，无声地飞到了整个地球上的每个角落，走进了每一个住所，每一个家庭，尖锐地刺痛了每一个劳动者的心。
    在那些日子里，人们有的暗地里一个人哭了，有的公开地当着许多人哭了。不仅一般男人们、女人们、老人们、小孩们痛哭，就是那些身经百战的英雄们、军人们，多少年在战场上从来没有哭过的，现在也忍不住滚下大颗大颗的眼泪。他们和她们哭了，因为一下子丧失了自己的慈父、良师、挚友、领袖。他们和她们哭了，因为他们的旗手躺下了，巨星、太阳殒落了。
    人们热爱斯大林，热爱他的天才，他的英明，他的理智，他的钢铁一般的意志，他的魄力，他的学说。对于和他同时代的人来说，人们爱他这个人，常常在我们中间的人，谁都觉得缺少不了的人。
    他和我们之间没有一点隔阂。所有的劳动者，工人、农民、兵士、工程师、科学家、文学家、艺术家、医生、教员……都把他当作自己的亲人。
    由于事实上的不可能，他当然不能够知道地面上的每一个人。可是谁都觉得，他是知道自己的。谁都觉得，他对自己，是父亲，又是兄弟，是严师又是诤友。
    每个人都觉得是和他联系着的，都诚实而坦白地对他献出自己的心。而他一辈子所唯一关心的就是人——我们全体和每个个人。他的天才和理智，他的意志和魄力，他的思想和学说，他的行事，他的政策，和平政策，他的伟大的人道主义——一切都是为着人类。
    平日这样觉得的，在那些悲痛的日子里，体会得更加深刻，更加亲切。
    那些日子，人们纷纷由苏联各地，由全世界各国到莫斯科来吊唁。人是那样的多，以致那样大的莫斯科都似乎盛不住了。在这里，去凭吊、去和斯大林作永别的人群，就像洪水似的，涌到那几条通工会大厦的街上，街心似乎因为人多而被压凹了些……显然，所有一切愿意凭吊的人，没有可能都到莫斯科来。他们，这些成千百万的人，离莫斯科都很远。但这些日子，不论在什么地方，在那个角落，成千百万的人，都朝着莫斯科看，朝着工会大厦的圆柱厅，在许多面飘着黑带或镶着黑边的半垂的红旗底下，在成千个绿叶的和各种颜色的花圈丛中，虔诚地望着斯大林的慈祥的、亲切的脸，甚至脸上的每一条绉纹——或者是重温曾经看见过的形象，或者凭照片想像。他们，这成千百万的人都默默地站在斯大林的遗体旁边，向他致最后的敬礼，作最后的诀别。
    而在三月九日的那一天，这些成千百万的人，不论在什么地方，又都在心里给他们的亲人、领袖、导师送葬。他们怎么，怎么也不能相信，这是他一生最后的一段路程。人们拖着沉重的、沉重的脚步，和着袅袅的哀乐，送他来到红场，来到列宁的陵寝……不由得刺眼，惊心，然后痛苦地承认：墓门上增加了一个名字：斯大林！
    人们送他来到了红场，却怎么，怎么也不能想像，今天他不站在陵墓的台上，和每年的“五一”和十月节日那样，让人们看见他慈祥地微笑，他和场中的人群相互亲切地招手，他却躺在陵前高台上面，一声不响……
    当红场上斯巴斯基塔上的大钟响了十二下的时候，全世界的劳动人民又都意识地用自己的千百万双手，帮着抬起了斯大林的遗体进入伟大的陵寝，然后小心地把他安放在伟大列宁遗体的一旁。这时候全世界都发出、都听见志哀的礼炮和工厂、火车、轮船汽笛的哀鸣。成千百万的工人在工厂，农民在田野，学生在课堂……都停止了操作，站在各自的岗位，严肃地低着头。正在步行的人们和正在行进的火车、汽车、马车……都停住不动。五分钟之内，全世界死一般地寂静。人人心里哀悼斯大林。
    自从伟大的列宁去世之后，将近三十年来，人类还不曾经受过这样无比严重、无比巨大的损失，人类还不曾感到过这样沉重的悲痛！
    但是，斯大林本人在列宁死后作出了光辉的榜样，人们记得，斯大林在一九二四年列宁死去之后，曾抑制住个人的悲痛，在导师列宁的灵柩前宣誓，不休息、不疲倦、不动摇地拿起他的光荣旗帜，继续他的不朽事业，为人民服务到底，为社会主义和共产主义建设奋斗到底。记起了那些日子时，人们擦干了眼泪，重新抬起了头。人们懂得：斯大林是最富于人性的人，他只喜欢坚强的人，而不喜欢软弱的人。
    于是人们就在这些悲痛的日子，在工厂，在矿山，在农场，在水电站，在一切建设工地……更加奋发，更加紧张地劳动、创造，为了建设社会主义和共产主义，为了人的幸福、自由，为了世界和平。——心里时时刻刻想着斯大林。
    于是另一些人们就在这些悲痛的日子，在战壕，在火线，也在工厂、矿山、码头、学校……在合法的议会，在非法的地下……更加愤怒，更加激烈、坚强地战斗、运动，为了反侵略、反压迫，为了民族的独立和人民的解放、自由，为了世界和平。——心里时时刻刻想着斯大林。
    斯大林在世之日就曾经是这些人和那些人的鼓舞者、领袖和导师。在他去世之后，人们只有继续高举他的旗帜，列宁斯大林的旗帜，遵循他的学说、教义，马克思列宁主义，照他所指示的道路前进，于是人们仍然充满了信心、希望。
    “我们的任务是要把悲痛化为力量”。——毛泽东同志为斯大林逝世而写的“最伟大的友谊”一文中的这一句话，就非常中肯、非常恰当而有力地道出了人人心中所要说的话，就成为对人人起最大鼓舞作用的伟大而响亮的号召。
    人们读了下面的一段话，更加鼓舞，更加提高了自己的信心：
   “现在苏联已达到这样的强大，中国人民革命已获得这样的伟大胜利，各人民民主国家的建设已有这样的巨大成就，世界各国人民的反压迫反侵略的运动已有这样的高涨，而我们的友谊和团结的阵线又是这样的巩固，所以，完全可以断言，对于任何帝国主义的侵略，我们都是不怕的。任何帝国主义的侵略都将被我们所粉碎，一切卑鄙的挑拨都是完全没有用的。”（毛泽东：“最伟大的友谊”）
    看，这就是我们的力量！为着继续发展和巩固这种力量，为着纪念“我们最敬爱的导师和我们最真挚的朋友斯大林同志的逝世”，“我们全党和全国人民，将继续以最大的坚定性，加强对于列宁斯大林所创造的苏联共产党和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的信任和支持，巩固以苏联为首的不可战胜的世界和平民主阵营”（中国共产党中央委员会致苏联共产党中央委员会的唁电）。
    “为着纪念我们伟大的导师斯大林，中国共产党和中国人民同苏联共产党和苏联人民，在斯大林的名义下的伟大友谊将无限地加强起来。”
    “显然，我们这种友谊所产生的力量是无穷无尽和真正无敌的。”（毛泽东：“最伟大的友谊”）
    看吧，这就是我们的力量！现在距那些沉痛的日子已经一年了。我们必须加倍努力来发展和巩固这种力量，加倍增强党的团结和人民的团结，稳步地走向社会主义。
    从东方，从西方，从地球的各处，都再一次响起“把悲痛化为力量”的口号。为着纪念伟大的斯大林去世的一周年，全世界各国人民默志哀悼之后，继续开动机器，拿起工具或武器，翻开书本……用加倍的努力劳动着，创造着，斗争着，来继续巩固和发展我们的力量。
    在劳动和斗争的时候，人们经常感到斯大林的亲切的爱抚，并从他那里吸取热力。人们觉得，斯大林是永远活着的，是经常和我们在一道的。他不仅止和我们这一辈的人，而且会和我们的后代子子孙孙永远在一道的。人们永远能够听见他的声音，无论在什么地方，在轰响的机器旁边，在广阔的土地上，在青绿的森林里，在碧蓝的海洋上，在研究室和课堂……在前线，在地底下……
    他永远、永远和我们在一起。和从来的历史巨人——马克思、恩格斯、列宁一样，斯大林是不死的，就如同太阳的光永远不会熄灭。
