Shattering the Prejudice That "Grain Weevils Cannot Be Controlled"

In 1953, 55 out of 80 grain warehouses in YuHang County, Zhejiang Province, were free of insects. This is a remarkable achievement in grain storage work.

Insect infestation is a serious enemy in grain storage. Soviet scholars have proven through experiments that the offspring of ten pairs of grain weevils, given ample grain and suitable living conditions, can damage over 406 tons of pure grain in five years.

Can such a serious enemy be eliminated? The answer from our grain storage cadres in the past was: at least under the current conditions, it is impossible to prevent insect infestations in grain warehouses. They believed that only modern, well-designed warehouses with steel frames on all sides, cement on all six sides, and complete ventilation, airtightness, and mechanical equipment could eliminate insect infestations.

When the news of insect-free grain warehouses first came out, many grain storage cadres were skeptical. Some grain storage cadres in Ningbo and Quzhou special districts, upon seeing the circular from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau commending YuHang County's insect-free grain warehouses, even thought it was just a method used by higher authorities to promote work, simply to encourage subordinates. Over the past four months, cadres from grain departments in many areas of Zhejiang Province have visited YuHang County. The Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the FengHua County People's Government Grain Bureau, while sitting in the car going to visit, still believed: this is impossible; otherwise, the equipment conditions must be particularly good.

But the facts told them: YuHang County's grain warehouses are not "modern, well-designed warehouses." Here, 80 percent of the warehouses are converted from ordinary houses, ancestral halls, temples, and guild halls, some of which are more than a hundred years old and very dilapidated. Before the autumn grain storage in 1952, these grain warehouses were also full of flying flour moths and crawling rice weevils. It was not uncommon to have 30 to 50 grain weevils per kilogram of grain. But last year, 55 of these 80 grain warehouses did indeed eliminate insect infestations.

A High Sense of Responsibility for Protecting National Grain

What are the reasons for YuHang County's pioneering of a large number of insect-free grain warehouses? "First and foremost, all grain work cadres in the county have established a high sense of responsibility for protecting national grain." This is the answer from Lin Changqing, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau, and Zhou Jiancheng, Chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the YuHang County People's Government Grain Bureau, who recently attended the National Grain Storage and Transportation Conference in Beijing.

Before the first half of 1952, grain work cadres in YuHang County had not well established the idea of cherishing national grain. Many grain keepers were not content with grain keeping work. Some said, "Keeper, no future; those with no ability enter the grain depot." Others said, "The keeper is always with brooms and dustpans, which is equivalent to the government hiring a few laborers, not a cadre." Among the five district grain depots in the county, keepers in Xianlin, Cangqian, and HengHu districts had requested to transfer their jobs. When insects were rampant in the warehouse, the keepers hid in their rooms reading novels or carrying bird guns to hunt sparrows for food. At that time, many farmers near the grain depot said, "Grain depot cadres have nothing to do all day, just eating and wandering around."

In 1952, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the YuHang County Party Committee led all cadres to actively participate in the study of Party consolidation and Party building. At this time, cadres in the grain department, from top to bottom, became enlightened and began to feel that the shortcomings in their work were intolerable: there were so many insects in the grain depot that people could not enter, and they felt itchy all over after coming out of the warehouse; in the first half of the year, there were sixteen accidents in the county, including heating, mold, leakage, and insect infestation. More than 2,000 jin of the more than 8,000 jin of wheat stored in a warehouse in the urban area were damaged by insects; ... How could this situation continue!

Under the active leadership of the county Party committee, the county grain bureau seized the opportunity of the province-wide clean-up and disinfection campaign and, starting in September 1952, promoted a labor red flag competition in the county's grain depots. At the monthly (1952) and quarterly (1953) award ceremonies, not only were model units awarded the winning red flag, but also the model deeds of active workers were commended. The red flag competition consolidated and gradually improved the ideological awareness of the keepers. In the past year, many keepers have been awarded red flowers and commended and rewarded at the county-wide award ceremonies.

Here, let us only talk about the deeds of Yu Chuanxiu, the keeper of the Xianlin District Grain Depot, who won the winning red flag twice last year.

Yu Chuanxiu was originally a township farmers' association director. When he was first transferred to work in the grain depot, he felt very uncomfortable. The grain depot was full of rice weevils and flour moths. At night, the mice squeaked non-stop, and he did not actively try to prevent and control them. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the study of Party consolidation and Party building, by the time the county launched the labor red flag competition in 1952, his work enthusiasm greatly improved. He often discussed with his comrades: "National construction and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea cannot be done without grain. The higher authorities trust us to keep so much grain, which is a glorious and important task." "If the grain is not well kept, we will be sorry to the people and sorry to Chairman Mao."

Before the autumn grain storage, he actively participated in the clean-up and disinfection work, even crawling under the warehouse floor to clean up the dirtiest places. In the past year, he has always maintained the cleanliness and hygiene of the warehouse and caught about three hundred mice. He keeps four warehouses, and he has created three insect-free grain warehouses. Usually, he cherishes the grain as he cherishes his own body. Sometimes it rains in the middle of the night, he always gets up and goes to the grain depot to look around, shining his flashlight on everything, until he thinks there is nothing wrong before he goes back to sleep. Thanks to his and other comrades' joint efforts, the Xianlin District Grain Depot won the winning red flag in the first and second quarters of 1953, and he himself was commended.

Scientific and Detailed Working Methods

According to Soviet experience, the fundamental principle of grain storage is "prevention is more important than cure"; to prevent and control grain weevils, the first thing to do is to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene. YuHang County has excellently implemented these two principles in the past year.

Before the autumn grain storage, all grain depots in YuHang County seized the opportunity of empty warehouses to facilitate disinfection and thoroughly carried out disinfection and pest control work. They adopted five steps: "thorough cleaning," "scraping out insect nests," "brushing and caulking," "chemical disinfection," and "padding bran and spraying powder." They had to clean up the garbage, insect carcasses, and other objects that could be seen on the surface, so that "the inside of the warehouse is clean on all six sides" (top, bottom, and four sides are all cleaned), "the outside of the warehouse has three no-lefts" (remove bricks, tiles, weeds, and dirt), and all warehouse equipment is knocked, brushed, and sun-dried. They also had to carefully scrape out the insect carcasses and cocoons in the cracks of beams, pillars, and wall panels, and block all cracks with paper-reinforced lime slurry, and then conduct a comprehensive disinfection to eliminate the root causes of grain weevils.

In this arduous and meticulous work, the keepers displayed great patience and work enthusiasm. For example, the biggest difficulty encountered in the thorough cleaning was: the bottom of the warehouse floor has always been a place where insects hide, but the warehouse floor is only one foot above the ground, and there is only one foot of space between the rows of piles. It is both humid and dirty, making it difficult to clean. In the face of this difficulty, the keepers showed a high sense of responsibility and launched the "crawl under the warehouse floor" movement. Xing Fuhe, the director of the Chengguan District Grain Depot and a Communist Party member, took the lead in crawling into the warehouse floor with a flashlight and broom. This warehouse was used to store warehouse equipment in the past, and the warehouse floor had never been cleaned. When he crawled to the middle, the smell of cat feces made him want to vomit, but after he finished cleaning the warehouse floor and hid to the side to vomit, he continued to crawl to other warehouse floors to clean.

Doing a good job in empty warehouse disinfection is only the first step in grain storage work.

After the grain was stored, YuHang County conducted a general survey of grain quality. According to the moisture, temperature, and insect infestation of the stored grain, each grain depot classified and registered the grain, first of all knowing the situation clearly. Then, according to the urgency of the situation, they dealt with it accordingly. By April of last year, in accordance with the law that the weather warms up and overwintering grain weevils begin to revive, the county grain bureau led another campaign to eliminate the surviving overwintering grain weevils.

When arranging the work of eliminating overwintering grain weevils, some keepers thought that the empty warehouse disinfection work had been done well, and they could no longer see any insects, so spraying insecticide again would be a waste. The inspection team organized by the county grain bureau patiently helped the keepers conduct a comprehensive search. The ninth sub-warehouse in the Cangqian District originally appeared to have no insects on the surface, but after the inspection team helped spray insecticide on the warehouse floor and around the warehouse, insects were found again. These facts educated the cadres of the grain depots and prompted them to conduct another thorough pest control campaign.

After that, they insisted on "frequent cleaning and careful inspection," and ensured that "immediately after wind and rain, clean up immediately; remove garbage at any time; conduct a comprehensive cleaning during inspections; deal with grain weevils in time." People who have been here have a common impression: the inside of the grain warehouses in YuHang County is clean and tidy; there is no garbage, sewage, or weeds within six meters outside the warehouse. The nearby farmers now praise: "The grain depot is always cleaned so clean, it's like New Year's every day!"

Soviet grain weevil control expert Comrade Morolov visited the insect-free grain warehouses in YuHang County in October last year. After the visit, he said with satisfaction: "The grain warehouses here can be used as a model for grain storage work." On January 17 this year, the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government and the East China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau held an award ceremony in Hangzhou for YuHang County's pioneering insect-free grain warehouses. The inscription on the banner awarded by the East China Grain Bureau to the YuHang County Grain Bureau is: "Banner of Grain Protection Work." The experience of YuHang County in storing grain will promote China's grain storage work to a new stage.

    粮食保管工作的先进旗帜
    龙春
    打破了“仓虫无法治”的偏见
    一九五三年，浙江省余杭县八十个粮食仓库中出现了五十五个无虫粮仓。这是粮食保管工作中的一项杰出的成就。
    虫害是粮食保管工作中的一个严重的敌人。苏联的学者们通过实验证明，十对谷象虫的后代，在有大批粮食和生存条件适宜的情况下，经过五年的时间，就能使四百零六吨以上的纯净粮食受到损害。
    这样严重的敌人能不能消除呢？我国粮食保管干部过去的答案是：至少在目前的条件下，粮仓不发生虫害是办不到的。他们认为，除非是现代化的合理仓库，四面钢骨，六面水泥，加上完善的通风、密闭和机械等设备，才有可能消除虫害。
    当无虫粮仓的消息刚传出来的时候，许多粮食保管干部都抱着怀疑的态度。宁波、衢州专区有的粮食保管干部，在看到浙江省人民政府粮食厅表扬余杭县无虫粮仓的通报的时候，还认为这不过是上级推动工作的一种方法，只是给下级打打气而已。四个多月来，浙江省许多地区粮食部门的干部到余杭县进行了参观。奉化县人民政府粮食局储运股股长坐在去参观的汽车上，还一直认为：这是不可能的事情；要不然，就是设备条件特别好。
    可是事实告诉他们：余杭县的粮仓并不是什么“现代化的合理仓库”。在这里，百分之八十的仓房都是利用普通民房、祠堂、庙宇、会馆改修的，有的还是一百多年前的建筑，已经非常破旧。在一九五二年秋粮入库以前，这些粮仓也曾经是麦蛾满天飞，米象满仓爬，每公斤粮食中有三十只到五十只仓虫，并不是稀罕事。可是到了去年，这八十个粮仓中就的的确确有五十五个粮仓消除了虫害。
    高度爱护国家粮食的责任心
    余杭县首创大批无虫粮仓的原因是什么呢？“首先是全县粮食工作干部树立了高度爱护国家粮食的责任心。”——这是最近在北京参加全国粮食储运会议的浙江省人民政府粮食厅储运科科长林常青和余杭县人民政府粮食局储运股股长周剑丞的回答。
    在一九五二年上半年以前，余杭县粮食工作干部并没有很好地树立起爱护国家粮食的思想。不少粮食保管员不安心于作粮食保管工作，有的说：“保管员，没前途；没有本事的入粮库。”有的说：“保管员一天净和扫帚、畚箕在一起，等于政府雇了几个小工，不是什么干部。”全县共有五个区粮库，其中闲林、仓前、横湖等区都曾有保管员要求调动工作。仓库里虫子闹得翻了天，保管员们却躲在房间里看小说，或者提着棵鸟枪到处打麻雀吃。那时候，粮库附近的许多农民说：“粮库干部一天到晚没有事，净是吃吃荡荡。”
    一九五二年，在“三反”“五反”运动的基础上，余杭县各级党委领导全县干部积极参加了整党建党的学习。这时候，粮食部门的干部，从上到下，眼睛都亮起来了，开始感觉工作中的缺点不能忍受了：粮库里的虫子多得进不去人，从仓房里出来，遍身都发痒；上半年全县发生了十六次事故，发热，霉坏，漏湿，虫害，样样都有，城关区一个仓房，存着八千多斤小麦就被虫子损害了两千多斤；……这种情况怎么能继续下去呢！
    县粮食局在县委积极领导下，抓住全省开展清仓消毒运动的时机，从一九五二年九月份起，推动全县粮库开展了劳动红旗竞赛。每月（一九五二年）、每季（一九五三年）的评奖大会上，不但奖给模范单位优胜红旗，还表扬工作积极者的模范事迹。红旗竞赛使保管员的思想觉悟巩固起来并逐步提高。一年多来，不少保管员在全县评奖大会上挂上了红花，受到了表扬和奖励。
    在这里，让我们只谈一下在去年连得两次优胜红旗的闲林区粮库的保管员——喻传秀的事迹吧。
    喻传秀原来是一个乡农会主任。他刚被调到粮库工作的时候，心里很不自在。粮库里到处是米象和麦蛾，一到晚上，老鼠吱吱喳喳叫个不停，他也没有积极想办法防治。经过“三反”“五反”运动和整党建党学习，到一九五二年全县开展劳动红旗竞赛的时候，他的工作积极性大为提高，平时常和同志们谈论：“国家建设也好，抗美援朝也好，没有粮食都不行。上级信任我们，叫我们保管这么多粮食，这是光荣、重大的任务。”“粮食保管不好，就对不起人民，对不起毛主席。”
    秋征公粮入库以前，他积极参加了清仓消毒工作，连仓板底下最肮脏的地方也爬进去扫除了。一年多来，他经常保持了仓房的清洁卫生，还捕了大约三百只老鼠。他保管着四个仓房，就创造了三个无虫粮仓。平时，他爱护粮食像爱护自己的身体一样。有时半夜下雨，他总是爬起来到粮库里看了又看，用手电筒照了又照，直到认为没有什么岔子了才去睡觉。由于他和其他同志的共同努力，闲林区粮库在一九五三年第一、第二季度都夺得了优胜红旗，他自己也受到了表扬。
    科学、细致的工作方法
    根据苏联的经验，保管粮食的根本方针是“防重于治”；要防治仓虫，首先要作好清洁卫生工作。余杭县一年多来出色地贯彻了这两个原则。
    在秋粮入库以前，余杭县各粮库都抓紧空仓便于消毒的时机，彻底进行了消毒杀虫工作。他们采用了“彻底扫除”、“剔刮虫巢”、“粉刷嵌缝”、“药剂消毒”和“垫糠喷粉”五个步骤。既要打扫干净表面上可以看得到的垃圾、虫尸等物，作到“仓内六面光”（上下、四方都打扫干净）、“仓外三不留”（清除砖瓦、杂草、污物）和仓具全部敲打刷晒，又要仔细剔刮梁柱、板壁隙缝中的虫尸、虫茧，用纸筋石灰浆堵塞所有裂缝，然后再进行全面的消毒，以杜绝仓虫发生的根源。
    在这个艰巨细致的工作中，保管员们发挥了极大的耐心和工作积极性。譬如在大扫除中碰到的最大的困难是：仓板底下一向是虫子躲藏的地方，但是仓底板离地只一尺高，一排排桩脚之间也只有一尺宽，里面既潮又脏，很难进去打扫。在这个困难面前，保管员们发挥了高度的责任心，发起了“爬仓底”运动。城关区粮库主任、共产党员邢福何带头拿着手电筒、扫帚爬进仓底。这个仓是过去存放仓具的地方，仓底下从来没有打扫过。爬到中间，猫屎味就熏得他直想吐，但他在打扫完这个仓底躲到一边呕过以后，又继续爬到别的仓底去打扫。
    作好空仓消毒工作，还只是保管粮食工作的第一步。
    在粮食入库以后，余杭县进行了粮质普查工作。各粮库根据存粮的水分、温度、虫害等情况，分类登记，首先作到了心中有数。然后分别缓急，进行处理。到去年四月，根据气温转暖，越冬仓虫开始复活的规律，县粮食局又领导开展了一次扑灭漏网越冬仓虫的工作。
    在布置扑灭越冬仓虫工作的时候，有些保管员认为空仓消毒工作已经作得不错了，已经看不到虫子，再来喷射杀虫药剂是一种浪费。县粮食局组织的会查组便耐心地帮助保管员们进行全面的搜索。仓前区第九分仓原来从表面上看已经没有虫子，但是经过会查组帮助在仓底和仓房周围喷射杀虫药剂以后，又发现了虫子。这些事实教育了各粮库的干部，推动他们又进行了一次彻底的杀虫工作。
    以后，他们坚持了“勤打扫，细检查”，作到了“风雨之后，立即打扫；看到垃圾，随时除掉；会查期间，全面扫除；发现仓虫，及时处理”。到过这里的人，都有一个共同的印象：余杭县粮库的仓房内部清洁干净；仓房外面六公尺之内看不到垃圾、污水和杂草。附近的农民现在都夸奖说：“粮库里老是打扫得干干净净，天天像过年一样！”
    苏联仓虫防治专家莫若洛夫同志在去年十月间到余杭县参观了无虫粮仓，参观后，他满意地说：“此地的粮仓可作为粮食保管工作的典范。”今年一月十七日，中央人民政府粮食部和华东行政委员会粮食局在杭州市举行了余杭县首创无虫粮仓授奖大会。华东粮食局奖给余杭县粮食局的锦旗上的题词是：“保粮工作的旗帜”。余杭县保管粮食工作的经验，将推动我国粮食保管工作走上一个新的阶段。
