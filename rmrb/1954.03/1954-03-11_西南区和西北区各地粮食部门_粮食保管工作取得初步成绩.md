Grain departments in various locations in the Southwest and Northwest regions have actively strengthened grain storage work and have made preliminary achievements.

Leading bodies of grain departments at all levels in the Southwest and Northwest regions attach great importance to grain storage work and generally made arrangements before the end of the local grain purchasing work. In early January, the Grain Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee also sent four inspection teams to Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou and other provinces to conduct in-depth inspections of warehouse protection and grain preservation work at the grassroots level. In mid-February, the Northwest Grain Administration sent a group of cadres to Shaanxi and Gansu to assist in carrying out the spring grain protection campaign. Leading bodies of grain departments in various provinces, most districts, and counties in the Southwest and Northwest also sent cadres for inspections, or went to key areas to assist in formulating storage plans and establishing and improving inspection systems. Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces have also successively held training classes for warehouse pest control personnel.

After studying the general line for the transitional period, grain depot cadres in the Southwest and Northwest regions further recognized the importance of grain storage work, and their work enthusiasm has generally increased. Grain department cadres in Fengdu County, Sichuan Province, decided to create thirty-one insect-free grain depots this year and challenged grain departments in other counties in the Fuling Special District to do the same. After studying the general line, cadres at the Xuanhebao Grain Depot in Zhongwei County, Ningxia Province, formulated a specific plan for grain storage. The plan stipulates a major inspection every five days, a minor inspection every three days, and spot checks of one or two warehouses every day. It also requires maintaining cleanliness inside and outside the warehouses and performing ventilation and airtightness work.

Due to the close supervision and inspection by the leading departments and the active work of the storage cadres, the grain storage work in the Southwest and Northwest regions has made preliminary achievements. Generally, all areas have paid attention to implementing the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than treatment" and have vigorously carried out warehouse cleaning and disinfection work. According to incomplete statistics from eight counties in Sichuan Province, including Jiangjin, Hechuan, Nanxi, and Guanghan, more than two million catties of garbage, weeds, tiles, and rubble have been cleared from the bottom of warehouses and around the warehouses. In the two months of November and December last year, the grain depots in the Pingliang Special District of Gansu Province swept an area of 80,000 square meters around the warehouses, removed more than 30,000 catties of garbage, and eliminated a large number of overwintering warehouse pests. After the grain was stored, all areas generally conducted a general survey of grain quality. Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, has inspected more than 40 million catties of grain and discovered and dealt with many problems in a timely manner. At the Fifth District Grain Depot in Huaning County, Yunnan Province, 200,000 catties of grain had heated up to 35 degrees Celsius. After inspection, the grain was turned and ventilated in a timely manner to lower the grain temperature and avoid accidents. Ningxia counties took advantage of the dry winter weather to lower the temperature and moisture content of the grain. At present, grain depots in the Southwest and Northwest regions are generally carrying out ventilation and sun-drying work based on the survey results, and many areas are also killing overwintering warehouse pests that have escaped.

    西南区和西北区各地粮食部门
    粮食保管工作取得初步成绩
    西南区和西北区各地粮食部门积极加强粮食保管工作，并已作出初步成绩。
    西南和西北区各级粮食部门领导机关对粮食保管工作都很重视，一般都在当地购粮工作结束以前作了布置。西南行政委员会粮食局在一月初还派出四个检查组分赴四川、云南、贵州等省深入基层重点检查护仓保粮工作。西北粮食管理局在二月中旬派出一批干部到陕西、甘肃协助开展春季保粮运动。西南和西北各省及大部分专区、县的粮食部门领导机关也派出干部进行巡回检查，或深入重点协助制定保管计划、建立和健全检查等制度。四川、贵州等省还先后举办了仓虫防治人员训练班。
    西南区和西北区各地粮库干部学习过国家过渡时期的总路线以后，进一步认识了粮食保管工作的重要性，工作积极性普遍提高。四川省酆都县粮食部门工作干部决定在今年创造三十一间无虫粮仓，并以此向涪陵专区各县粮食部门挑战。宁夏省中卫县宣和堡粮库干部学过总路线以后，订出了保管粮食的具体计划。计划中规定了五天一次大检查、三天一次小检查、每天抽查一两个库房等制度，并要求经常保持仓房内外清洁卫生，作好通风密闭等工作。
    由于领导部门抓紧督促检查，保管干部发挥了工作积极性，西南区和西北区粮食保管工作已作出初步成绩。各地一般都注意贯彻了“防重于治”的粮食保管方针，大力进行了清仓消毒工作。四川省据江津、合川、南溪、广汉等八县的不完全统计，已在仓底和仓库周围清除垃圾、杂草、瓦砾等二百多万斤。甘肃省平凉专区各县粮库在去年十一、十二两月内，即对仓库周围八万平方公尺的地区进行了扫除，清除垃圾三万多斤，并消灭了大批越冬仓虫。在粮食入库以后，各地一般都进行了粮质普查工作。四川省江津县已检查了四千万斤以上的粮食，并发现和及时处理了不少问题。云南省华宁县第五区粮库有二十万斤粮食曾发热到摄氏三十五度，经检查发现，及时翻仓通风，降低粮食温度，避免了发生事故。宁夏各县趁冬季天气干燥，都进行了降低粮食温度和水分的工作。目前，西南、西北各地粮库一般都在根据普查情况，进行通风、翻晒工作，许多地区并在扑杀漏网越冬仓虫。
