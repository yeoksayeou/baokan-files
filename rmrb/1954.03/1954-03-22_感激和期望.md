  Gratitude and Expectations
    On the morning of March 18th, a meeting was held in the auditorium of a People's Liberation Army hospital in Beijing between convalescing veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and representatives of the visiting North Korean People's Delegation. Over four hundred convalescing veterans looked with excitement and gratitude at their North Korean friends. Head of the delegation, Kim Ung-gi, earnestly said: "Dear comrades, the Korean people will never forget your magnificent achievements in the struggle for the liberation of our country. You defended our country with your own blood. All the Korean people are infinitely grateful to you, and regard your injuries as our own injuries. We sincerely wish you a speedy recovery..." Then, Kim Ung-gi presented a large flower basket brimming with blossoms to all the wounded and sick soldiers. The flower basket was presented by delegation representatives, Republic Hero Jang Hyun-hwa and Korean People's Army female tank driver Choi Bun-ok, and accepted by Cui Jianguo, a first-class hero and special-class meritorious person of the Volunteer Army, on behalf of all the wounded and sick soldiers. At this moment, thunderous applause rang out from the stage and the audience, and the bright mercury lights shone on the entire hall. As the cameras whirred, this moving scene was captured by Chinese and Korean photographers.
    Next, the representatives of the visiting delegation went to various wards. When those comrades who were seriously injured on Korean soil appeared before Kim Ung-gi, his eyes welled up with tears. He didn't seem to walk, but rather felt his way to the beds of those wounded soldiers, shaking hands with them tightly and kissing them. When Kim Ung-gi came to the bed of Du Chaozhen, a second-class meritorious person of the Volunteer Army who was wounded at Shangganling, he gave him a bouquet of flowers, kissed him, and at the same time told Du Chaozhen kindly: "Our common struggle has already achieved a great victory. The Korean people have been fully mobilized to carry out restoration and construction work. The great cause that comrades helped us with in Korea, we are now continuing it with rapid construction. We are very excited about this visit to China by our delegation, to see China's great socialist construction. Comrade, please recuperate well and we wish you a speedy recovery."
    During the break, the representatives had a cordial conversation with the convalescing veterans, doctors, and nurses of the hospital for an hour.
    Before the delegation left the hospital, Kim Ung-gi neatly wrote his inscription on a piece of green satin. No, this is the gratitude and expectations of all the Korean people for the Volunteer Army convalescing veterans:
    "The Chinese People's Volunteer Army marched ten thousand miles to our country. In the severe winter snow and amidst the rain of bullets, they displayed unparalleled perseverance, and were injured in fierce battles. We are very saddened. Thanks to your heroic battles alongside the Korean People's Army, the war has ended in victory. We sincerely congratulate you on your speedy recovery and hope you will participate in the socialist construction of your great motherland." (Lian Yunshan) (Attached picture)

  　感激和期望
    三月十八日上午，北京市某陆军医院的礼堂里志愿军休养员和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表们会面了。四百多位休养员，以兴奋和感激的目光注视着来自朝鲜的友人们，金应基团长恳切地说：“亲爱的同志们，朝鲜人民永远不会忘记你们在争取我们祖国解放战争中建树的丰功伟迹，你们以自己的鲜血保卫了我们的祖国，全体朝鲜人民无限感激你们，把你们的伤看成自己的伤，衷心地祝你们早日恢复健康。……”接着，金应基团长把一个百花争艳的大花篮，献给全体伤病员，这个花篮由代表团代表、共和国英雄张贤化和朝鲜人民军女坦克手崔粉玉捧献，由志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣崔建国代表全体伤病员接受，这时，台上台下掌声雷动，白色的水银灯光照射全场，随着摄影机的轧轧作响：这一动人的场面，被朝中两国摄影师摄入了镜头。
    接着，访华代表团的代表们到了各个病房。当那些在朝鲜国土上身负重伤的同志出现在金应基团长的眼前时，他的眼睛湿润了，他好象不是走到，而是摸到那些伤员的床前，和他们紧紧地握手，吻着他们。当金应基团长走到在上甘岭负伤的志愿军二等功臣杜朝珍床前时，他把一束鲜花送给他，吻着他，同时亲切地告诉杜朝珍说：“我们的共同斗争，已经获得了伟大的胜利。朝鲜人民已经总动员起来进行恢复和建设工作。同志们在朝鲜帮助我们的伟大事业，我们现在正以迅速的建设来继续它。我们代表团这次来中国访问，看到中国的伟大的社会主义建设，我们十分兴奋，同志，请你好好休养，愿你早日恢复健康。”
    在休息时，代表们和医院的休养员、医生、护士们亲密地交谈了一小时。
    代表团离开医院以前，金应基团长在一块绿缎上面工工整整地写下了他的题词，不，这是全朝鲜人民对志愿军休养员的感激和期望：
    “中国人民志愿军行军万里，来到我们祖国，在严冬寒雪和枪林弹雨中，表现了无比坚毅，在顽强战斗中负了伤，我们非常难过。由于你们和朝鲜人民军的英勇战斗，已经以胜利而终止了战争，忠心地祝贺你们早日恢复健康，参加你们伟大祖国的社会主义建设。”（连云山）（附图片）
