    For the Victory of the War and the Reconstruction of the Motherland
    --Li Zhongxiu, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Transportation Workers' Occupational League, Talks About the Heroic Struggle of Korean Railway Workers
    Chen Youwei
    On the morning of the ninth day after the Korean armistice, a newly renovated train slowly departed from Pyongyang Station northward amidst thunderous cheers. The bright Korean, Chinese, and Soviet flags fastened to the front of the locomotive fluttered in the wind, and the train quickly sped through the rolling hills. At the same time, the first peace trains also departed from cities such as Sinuiju, Kaesong, Wonsan, and Najin. The gunfire had only stopped a few days ago, but the main lines of North Korean railways were already fully open. The heroic train symbolizes heroic Korea; it has withstood the test of war, won a glorious victory, and is now heading towards a happy future in an unstoppable manner.
    During the war years, inhuman aggressors poured countless tons of steel, explosives, gasoline bombs, and time bombs onto the land of North Korea, most of which were aimed at rails, stations, and bridges. No railway in the world has ever suffered so much damage, but no railway has ever been repaired so quickly; despite the enemy's repeated boasts of their "victory" of "blockade," the fact is that Korean railway employees, with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army railway corps, guaranteed the uninterrupted passage of railway transport with their blood and lives, ensuring the timely supply of military needs, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the war. During the war, countless heroes emerged on all fronts of Korean railway transport, creating many amazing miracles.
    Li Zhongxiu, a member of the Korean People's Delegation to China and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Transportation Workers' Occupational League, first told us about the heroic deeds of Choi Chi-jeong, the stationmaster of Jiachuan Station, who led his staff in protecting trains and rescuing materials. One night, a train fully loaded with ammunition and military supplies arrived at Jiachuan Station. As it added coal and water and was about to continue its journey forward, enemy planes suddenly flew in from a distance. The train was unfortunately discovered, and machine gun bullets rained down like raindrops, and bombs exploded around the train. The station was instantly filled with smoke and fire, and soon the bright red flames engulfed the train, and several carriages were about to explode. The situation was critical. Choi Chi-jeong realized his great responsibility to the motherland and immediately led everyone, braving the rain of bullets, to crawl under the train to remove the hot couplings of the carriages, separating the burning carriages from the train. In this battle, many people gloriously shed their last drop of blood for the motherland. Because of their dedication, seventeen carriages full of military supplies were finally rescued and pulled forward by the locomotive. During the war, the employees of various stations in the rear of Korea not only persistently repaired the damaged platforms, lines, and switches under the difficult conditions of enemy bombing and strafing, and carried out extremely complex scheduling and transfer work to ensure the passage of trains, but also bravely rescued materials from the flames, just like the employees of Jiachuan Station, who were awarded the First Class Order of Freedom and Independence.
    Train drivers have a particularly important position in railway transport. Korean drivers demonstrated extraordinary courage, determination, composure, and resourcefulness. Almost no driver does not have a story of fighting enemy planes, and many people who have won the title of Hero of the Republic, such as Han Nan-su, Yun Chang-rok, and the female driver Park Chun-wol, are well known. Han Nan-su is the banner of Korean railway workers; he has rescued many trains and locomotives from the bombing and strafing of enemy planes. Yun Chang-rok, a young man who officially became a driver on the first day of the war, completed 146% of the transport plan and safely ran more than 21,000 kilometers under wartime conditions. His story is touching: One day before dawn, he was driving his locomotive "Minqing" along the coastline. Suddenly four enemy ships appeared at sea. Flares were lit one after another, followed by continuous shelling. The earth-shattering explosions shook the body of the train. But the fearless Yun Chang-rok tightened his grip on the locomotive's control lever and accelerated forward, finally breaking through the bombardment circle of the naval guns and transporting the materials to their destination. A few days later, his train was again subjected to tracking strafing and bombing by enemy planes. There was no place to hide in the open surroundings, so he gritted his teeth and drove the train forward at full speed. Later, a bomb exploded nearby, and Yun Chang-rok was hit by shrapnel, and his head was shaken dizzy. When he drove the train into the shelter ahead in a semi-conscious state, he collapsed unconscious. The blood flowing from his injured lower limbs had stained the iron plate he was standing on. But after a short period of treatment and recuperation, Yun Chang-rok returned to his job with fighting will and vigorous energy. Park Chun-wol, a female driver almost known to everyone in Korea, led a women's crew and personally drove their "Sasha" locomotive (Sasha was a heroic female driver in the Soviet Patriotic War), sending grain and ammunition to the front line in a continuous stream.
    The enemy is cunning; they not only directly bombed and strafed, but also dropped many time bombs near railways and bridges. But in the face of the heroic Korean people, time bombs also lost their effectiveness. The brilliant deeds of Jin Zaihao, cited by Comrade Li Zhongxiu, are the best proof. Once, Jin Zaihao led a commando team to clear time bombs dropped by the enemy near a railway bridge for three consecutive days. Suddenly, one of them exploded, overturning a broken carriage on the side of the road onto the track. In this way, people still have to find a way to move the broken carriage that cannot be moved by manpower. Jin Zaihao decided to use a large time bomb to destroy this obstacle lying on the railway. This work was dangerous, but Jin Zaihao was unwilling to let others do it. After using the strength of a dozen people to move a large 500-kilogram time bomb next to the carriage, he immediately told others to leave. But the fuse was not lit smoothly, and it went out several times, leaving only three or four inches long. It would be very dangerous to light it again. Comrades dissuaded him, but Jin Zaihao firmly said: "It doesn't matter, as long as the carriage can be blown open so that the train can pass." When he lit the fuse and desperately rolled into a bomb crater more than ten yards away, the large time bomb exploded with a bang, the broken carriage was blown to pieces, and the obstacles on the road were cleared. People thought Jin Zaihao had sacrificed himself, but he pushed away the mud covering his body, jumped out of the bomb crater, and immediately directed everyone to fill the bomb crater and lay the rails, so that the train waiting behind could quickly pass. Because of such a dedication, Jin Zaihao won the honorary title of Hero of the Republic.
    Korean railway workers not only fought selflessly, but also made many inventions and innovations in technology to overcome wartime difficulties and improve transport rates. They created the "wartime rapid operation method," changing the original system of scheduled departures, so that locomotives ran continuously one after another, to the point of creating a high record of 48 departures in one day and night. Park Bing-hoon, a worker at the Hamhung Locomotive Depot, created a "smoke pipe cleaner," which increased the efficiency of manufacturing smoke pipes by three times, accelerating the speed of train repairs. The "direction correction machine" created by Han Fengxian of the Pyongyang Railway Bureau and the "track correction machine" created by Yu Guishi of the Qingjin Railway Bureau can quickly correct the tracks that were distorted by enemy planes with very little manpower. The efforts of Korean railway workers and the support of Chinese railway aid workers have greatly increased the volume of railway transport in North Korea during the war, rather than decreasing it. If the transport volume in 1946 is 100, then it was 126 in 1951, and it was as high as 324 or more in 1953.
    After the armistice, Korean railway employees once again threw themselves into the work of recovery and construction in a fighting posture. They launched a movement to repair locomotives, collect rails, and straighten lines. Employees of the Hamhung Railway Administration collected more than 19,000 rails totaling more than 125,000 meters in just over a month. Employees of the Li Renchao Locomotive Depot repaired more than 20 locomotives on the second day after the armistice. Labor hero and driver Zheng Daoming shortened the time to enter and exit the garage, increasing the locomotive's attendance rate by 30%. Comrade Li Zhongxiu said that in the short period after the armistice, Korea has repaired 116 permanent or semi-permanent large bridges, and repaired more than 400 freight cars and more than 40 passenger cars. In the construction work, the railway corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army gave great help.
    On the land of North Korea, victorious trains are now running freely again. They pass through hills, cross rivers, and along the coast, transporting timber to the south and rice to the north. Machines, equipment, automobiles, fabrics, farm tools, and food sent from the Soviet Union, China, and distant Eastern Europe are also distributed to various places through them. The life of rebuilding the motherland is boiling. Korean railways and trains are like the arteries of the human body, infusing their motherland with fresh blood, making it stronger and more prosperous.

    为了战争的胜利和祖国的重建
    ——朝鲜交通劳动者职业同盟中央委员会委员长李钟秀谈朝鲜铁路工人的英勇斗争
    陈有为
    朝鲜停战后第九天的早上，一列整修得焕然一新的火车，在人们雷动的欢呼声中从平壤车站徐徐出发向北行进。扎在机车头前的鲜艳的朝、中、苏三国国旗，迎风招展，列车顷刻间就急速地穿行在起伏的丘陵地带了。在这同时，从新义州、开城、元山、罗津等城市，也开出了同样的第一列的和平列车。炮火才停止不过短短的几天，而北朝鲜铁道的各个主要干线却就全线畅通了。英雄的列车象征着英雄的朝鲜，它经受住了战争的考验，赢得了辉煌的胜利，今天正在不可阻挡地奔向幸福的前程。
    在战争的岁月里，丧尽人性的侵略者，曾向北朝鲜土地上倾泻了无数吨的钢铁、炸药、汽油弹和定时弹，其中大部分都是投向铁轨、车站和桥梁的。世界上没有一条铁道曾经受过这样多的破坏，但也没有一条铁道曾经这样快地修复了；尽管敌人一再吹嘘他们“封锁”的“胜利”，而事实却是：朝鲜的铁路员工在中国人民志愿军铁道部队的帮助之下，以自己的鲜血和生命保证了铁道运输的不间断的通行，保证了军需的及时供应，从而保证了战争的胜利。在战争期间，朝鲜铁道运输的各个战线上，涌现出了无数的英雄人物，创造出了许多的惊人奇迹。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员、朝鲜交通劳动者职业同盟中央委员会委员长李钟秀同志，首先为我们谈了价川车站站长崔致政领导员工保护列车、抢救物资的英勇事迹。有一天夜晚，价川车站上来到了一列满载着弹药、军火的列车。当它加添了煤和水正要继续驶向前方的时候，突然从远处飞来了敌机。列车不幸被发现了，于是机枪弹就像雨点般地扫射了下来，炸弹也在列车的四周爆炸了。站内顿时烟硝腾空，火光四起，很快鲜红的火舌卷向了列车，有几节车厢眼看就要爆炸了。这时情况是危急的。崔致政意识到自己对祖国的重大责任，立刻带领大家，冒着枪林弹雨，钻到车底下去摘掉已被烤得烫热的车厢的挂钩，把着了火的车厢和列车分离开来。在这一场斗争中，不少人为祖国光荣地流尽了最后的一滴血。因为他们的献身，满载着军需物资的十七节车厢终于被抢救了出来，由机车拉着往前跑了。在战时，朝鲜后方各个车站的员工们，不仅在敌机狂轰滥炸的困难条件下，坚持不懈地整修被毁的站台、线路和道岔，进行着极为复杂的调度和换车工作以保证列车的通行，而且还勇敢地从火焰中抢救物资，就像曾经荣获一级自由独立勋章的价川车站的员工们一样。
    火车司机在铁道运输上有着特别重要的地位。朝鲜的司机们表现了非凡的勇敢、坚定、沉着和机智。几乎没有一个司机没有和敌机搏斗的事迹，而许多荣获共和国英雄称号的人物，如韩南洙、尹昌禄和女司机朴春月等，更是大家所熟知的。韩南洙是朝鲜铁路工人的旗帜，他曾从敌机的狂轰滥炸之下先后抢救出了许多辆列车和机车。从战争开始那一天才正式担任司机工作的年轻的尹昌禄，曾经超额百分之一百四十六地完成运载计划，并且在战争的情况下安全运行了两万一千多公里。他的事迹是动人的：有一天黎明前，他驾着自己的机车“民青”号，在海岸线上奔驰着。突然四艘敌舰在海上出现了。照明弹一个一个地挂了起来，接着是连续不断的炮击。天崩地裂似的爆炸，震动了列车的车身。但毫不畏惧的尹昌禄却更加握紧了机车的操纵杆，加速地前进着，结果终于突出了舰炮的轰击圈，而把物资运到了目的地。几天以后，他的列车又遭到了敌机的追踪扫射和轰炸，空旷的四周没有可以躲避的地方，于是他就咬紧牙关驾着车子疾驰前进。后来一颗炸弹在附近炸开了，尹昌禄受到了弹片的袭击，头脑也给震得昏昏沉沉的。当他在半知觉的状态中把列车开进了前面掩蔽所里的时候，就不省人事地倒了下来。从受伤的下肢淌下来的鲜血，已沾满了他所站着的铁板。但经过一个短时期的治疗和休养以后，尹昌禄又带着战斗的意志和充沛的精力回到了自己的工作岗位。在朝鲜几乎尽人皆知的女司机朴春月，曾领导了一个妇女包乘组，亲自驾驶着她们的“沙霞”号机车（沙霞是苏联卫国战争中的英雄女司机），把粮食和弹药源源不绝地送到了前方。
    敌人是狡猾的，他们不但直接轰炸扫射，而且还向铁道、桥梁附近投下了许多定时弹。但是在英勇的朝鲜人民面前，定时弹也失去了作用。李钟秀同志所举的金在镐的光辉事迹，就是最好的证明。有一次，金在镐带领一个突击队来清除敌人连续三天投放在一座铁桥附近的定时炸弹。忽然其中的一颗爆炸了，把路边的一节坏车皮炸翻到轨道上。这样，人们就还得设法搬开用人力无法搬动的坏车皮。金在镐决定用大定时弹来炸毁这个横在铁道上的障碍物，这项工作是危险的，但金在镐却不愿让别人来干。在用十几个人的力量把一颗五百公斤重的大定时弹搬到了车皮旁边以后，他就立刻叫别人走开。但导火线点得不顺利，点了几回都灭了，结果只剩下了三四寸长。再去点就很危险了。同志们劝阻他，而金在镐却坚决地说：“没关系，只要能把车皮炸开，让火车能通过去就好了。”当他点着了导火线拚命滚进十多丈外的一个弹坑里的时候，大定时弹就轰然一声地爆炸了，坏车皮被炸得粉碎，路面上的障碍给清除了。人们以为金在镐已经牺牲，但他却推开了覆满身上的泥土，跳出弹坑，马上指挥大家填弹坑铺铁轨，让等在后面的列车迅速地通行过去。因为这样的献身行动，金在镐获得了共和国英雄的光荣称号。
    朝鲜铁道工人不仅舍身斗争，而且还为克服战时困难，提高运输率而在技术方面有不少创造发明。他们创造了“战时迅行运转法”，改变原来定时发车的制度，而使机车一辆接着一辆地连续运行，以至创造了一昼夜发车四十八次的高纪录。咸兴机务段的工人朴炳勋创造了“烟管清除器”，使制造烟管的效率提高到三倍，加速了火车的修理速度。平壤路局韩凤贤创造的“方向校正机”和清津路局俞奎石创造的“轨道校正机”，可以用很少的人力就能迅速地校正被敌机炸歪了的轨道。朝鲜铁道工人的努力和中国援朝铁路员工的支持，使北朝鲜的铁路运输量在战时不但没有减低，而且是大大地增加了。如果以一九四六年的运输量为一百，那么一九五一年为一百二十六，而到一九五三年更高达三百二十四以上了。
    停战以后，朝鲜的铁路员工们又以战斗的姿态投入了恢复与建设工作。他们展开了修复机车、收集铁轨、整理线路的运动。咸兴铁道管理局的员工们，在短短的一个多月内就收集了长达十二万五千多公尺的一万九千多根铁轨。李仁朝机务段的员工们在停战以后的第二天就修复了二十多辆机车。劳动英雄、司机郑道明缩短了出入车库的时间，把机车的出勤率提高了百分之三十。李钟秀同志说，在停战以后的短短期间内，朝鲜已修复了一百一十六座永久性或半永久性的大桥梁，修复了四百多辆货车和四十多辆客车。在修建工作中，中国人民志愿军的铁道部队给予了极大的帮助。
      在北朝鲜的土地上，胜利的列车今天又在自由地驰骋了。它们穿过山冈，越过江河，沿着海岸，把木材运到南方，把稻米送往北部。从苏联、中国和遥远的东欧送来的机器、装备、汽车、布匹、农具和粮食，也经由它们而分到了各地。重建祖国的生活正在沸腾着。朝鲜的铁道和列车就像人体的动脉
  一样，给自己的祖国灌注着新鲜的血液，使它更加强壮更加繁荣起来。
