Since Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, began its general election in July of last year, it has taken more than seven months, and 130 townships and towns have now been successfully completed, with other townships and towns still in progress. By mid-March, the entire county will have completed the grassroots elections and move on to preparing for and convening the County People's Congress.

During the general election, over 100,000 returned overseas Chinese and their families enthusiastically participated in the general election, just like the rest of the county's people. Many of them also served as propagandists, explaining the significance and policies of the general election to the masses, enabling returned overseas Chinese and their families to more deeply appreciate the loveliness of the motherland and the care of the People's Government for overseas Chinese. Before liberation, when remittances arrived from Southeast Asia, the families of overseas Chinese were often subjected to banditry, but now the social order is peaceful, and even if doors are not locked at night, nothing will happen. This has made returned overseas Chinese and their families further realize the close relationship between consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and electing representatives. Previously, some families of overseas Chinese did not allow their children to go out to work, but in this general election, they also encouraged them to come out. Lai Suncheng, a returned overseas Chinese in Sanhe Township, had been forced to go to Southeast Asia to make a living because his family had been persecuted several times by the Kuomintang reactionaries and he was afraid of being drafted. After returning to China this time, he was very happy to see the rapid progress of the motherland. He stated that although he would be going abroad again soon, he would definitely participate in the election before leaving. He also mobilized his family to actively participate in the general election and to participate in social activities frequently in the future. During the elections in various townships throughout the county, the participation rate of voters was generally over 80%. Many outstanding returned overseas Chinese and their families were honorably elected as people's representatives or township chiefs, deputy township chiefs, and members of township people's government committees. In Wutan Township, the 8th District, five of the thirteen newly elected members of the township people's government committee were relatives of overseas Chinese, and eighteen of the thirty-five people's representatives in the township were relatives of overseas Chinese.

After the general election, the enthusiasm of cadres for their work and the masses for production has been further enhanced, and the relationship has become even closer. Wang Yancheng, a newly elected member of the People's Government Committee in Lutian Township, 3rd District, discovered many rice stem borers in the fields not long after the general election (in September of last year), and actively led the masses of the whole township to the fields to control the pests, ensuring a bumper late rice harvest. In Xiaolin Township, 17th District, the feudal contradictions in the township used to be very serious, and armed conflicts often occurred, even resulting in deaths. In the general election, after democratic unity education, the masses of the whole township realized that only by uniting could they do a good job in production. Under the leadership of the newly elected township chief Xu Yongbo (a relative of an overseas Chinese) and all the cadres, they jointly built twenty-six sea dikes and dug more than twenty new wells, which could prevent more than 1,000 mu of land in the township from being harmed by water, drought, and tides. Farmer Xu Shuipu said: "If it were not for the liberation and this general election, how could our township of armed conflicts and feuds have become a township of intimacy and unity?"

Through this general election, the broad masses have further realized the democratic essence of our country's general election. As Li Zhaowu, a returned overseas Chinese who had lived in the Philippines for many years in the 7th District, said: "Through this general election, I have further realized that the capitalist election tricks are all deceptive. In reality, only those with money and power can be elected as candidates, regardless of whether the voters agree or not, they must vote for him. This general election in our motherland is true democracy. The representative candidates nominated are all people who can work for the masses and are supported by the masses. If we do not agree, we can nominate others or not vote for him. This is true democracy." (Zheng Bingshan)

    福建省晋江县在普选运动中
    许多归国侨胞和侨属当选人民代表
    福建省晋江县从去年七月间开始进行普选以来，历时七个多月，现在已有一百三十个乡、镇胜利完成，其他乡、镇正在进行。到三月中旬，全县可全部结束基层选举，转入筹备和召开县人民代表大
  会。
    在普选当中，十多万归国侨胞和侨胞眷属与全县人民一样，都热烈地参加了普选。他们中的许多人并担任了宣传员，向群众讲解普选的意义和政策，使归国侨胞及其眷属更深刻地体会到祖国的可爱和人民政府对侨胞的关怀。解放前，南洋一寄来侨汇，侨眷就常常遭到匪劫，而现在社会秩序安宁，就是夜不闭户也不会发生什么事情了。这样就使归国侨胞和侨属进一步体会到巩固人民民主专政及选举代表和自己的切身关系。以前有些侨属不让自己的子女出去参加工作，在普选中也鼓励他们出来了。三合乡归国侨胞赖孙成过去因家庭被国民党反动派数次迫害，又怕抓壮丁，不得已跑到南洋去谋生。这次回国后，看见祖国进步得这样快，非常欢喜。他表示虽然不久就要再出国，但一定要参加选举后才走。他并动员家属积极参加普选，以后也要经常参加社会活动。全县各乡在选举时，参加选举的选民一般都在百分之八十以上。许多优秀的归国侨胞和侨属光荣的当选为人民代表或乡长、副乡长、乡人民政府委员。第八区浯潭乡新选出来的十三个乡人民政府委员中有五个是侨属，全乡三十五个人民代表中，有十八个是侨属。
    普选以后，干部的工作和群众的生产积极性更加提高了，关系也愈加密切了。第三区炉田乡新选举出来的人民政府委员王燕成在普选后没有几天
  （去年九月间），发现田里有许多稻苞虫，就积极带动全乡群众下田治虫，保证了晚稻的丰收。第十七区萧林乡，以前乡里的封建矛盾很严重，经常发生械斗，甚至害死人命。在普选中，经过了民主团结的教育，全乡群众认识到只有团结起来才能搞好生产，就在新选出来的乡长许永帛（侨属）和全体干部领导下，共同兴修了二十六条海堤和新开了二十多个水井，可使全乡一千多亩地避免水、旱和海潮的侵害。农民许水普说：“如果不是解放后和这次普选，我们这个械斗乡、冤家乡那里会变成亲密乡、团结乡。”
    通过这次普选，广大群众进一步认识到我国普选的民主实质。正如七区在菲律宾住过多年的归国侨胞李昭武说：“通过这次普选，使我更进一步认识到资本主义那套选举花样都是骗人的，实际上只有那些有钱有势的人才能当选为候选人，不管选民同意不同意都要选他。我们祖国这次普选才是真正的民主，提的代表候选人都是能为群众办事和受到群众拥护的人，如果我们不同意还可另外提别人或不选他，这样才是真正的民主。”　（郑炳山）
