Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: TASS, March 16th dispatch from Tokyo: According to Tokyo sources, the Li Chengwan clique has recently resumed activities to establish an "anti-communist group" in the Far East.

Choi Duk-shin, acting as Li Chengwan's "special representative" to Southeast Asian countries to "study" the "future" of establishing a Pacific military group, said after returning to South Korea on March 15th: "In April, South Korea will convene a Far East and Southeast Asian anti-communist nations conference in Seoul." Choi Duk-shin said that the invitees include the Philippines, the Taiwan Kuomintang group, Thailand, the Bao Dai puppet government, the Laotian puppet government, the Cambodian puppet government, and Japan.

Reports indicate that the purpose of the "Seoul Conference," as announced, is "to strengthen the anti-communist front" and "establish an 'anti-communist alliance'" to oppose the People's Republic of China.

It is no coincidence that opponents of a peaceful resolution to the Far East question have set such a date to intensify their activities. The mere fact that the "Seoul Conference" is scheduled to be held at the time of the Geneva Conference's opening exposes the provocative nature of this conspiracy.

### 阴谋阻挠远东问题的和平解决  李匪帮企图拼凑“反共集团”

    阴谋阻挠远东问题的和平解决
    李匪帮企图拼凑“反共集团”
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社十六日讯：据东京消息，李承晚分子最近重新从事在远东成立一个“反共集团”的活动。
    以李承晚“特别代表”的身份到东南亚各国去“研究”成立一个太平洋军事集团的“前途”的崔德新，在三月十五日回到南朝鲜后说：“四月间，南朝鲜将在汉城召开一个远东和东南亚反共国家会议。”崔德新说，被邀请的有菲律宾、台湾国民党集团、泰国、保大傀儡政府、寮国傀儡政府、高棉傀儡政府和日本。
    消息表明，“汉城会议”的目的，就像所宣布的，是“要加强反共阵线”，“成立一个‘反共联盟’”来反对中华人民共和国。
    和平解决远东问题的反对者们订了这样的日期来加紧活动，这并不是偶然的。单单是“汉城会议”订在日内瓦会议开幕的时候举行这一点，就暴露了这个阴谋的挑衅性质。
