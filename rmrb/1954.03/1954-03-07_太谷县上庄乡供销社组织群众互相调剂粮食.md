The Shangzhuang Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Taigu County, Shanxi Province, after completing the grain planned purchase task, promptly organized the masses to adjust surplus grain between households with surplus and households with shortages, and also to adjust different types of grain, thus stimulating the rural economy. In January alone, the supply and marketing cooperative purchased more than 23,000 jin of grain; supplied more than 4,200 jin of grain to households in need and organized mutual adjustments among the masses, and supplied 3,300 jin of raw grain to flour mills, tofu workshops and other workshops.

At the end of the grain planned purchase work, due to insufficient and in-depth publicity of policies such as surplus grain being available for mutual exchange, some of the masses once developed some ideological concerns, and the rural economy was not active enough. For example, farmer Bai Dan had surplus sorghum but could not exchange it for beans; Xiao Wa wanted to sell some grain to buy floral cloth for his wife, but was afraid that others would say that he did not sell to the state in the past and was backward. After the local working cadres and the Communist Party branch of the township studied this situation, they explained to the masses that selling grain to the state in the past was glorious, and that now taking out surplus grain for adjustment was also very good, and that farmers taking surplus grain for small-scale mutual exchange transactions was permitted by the state. After the masses fully understood the state's grain policy, the grain quickly circulated. The supply and marketing cooperative could purchase several hundred jin of grain a day, and more than 1,000 jin a day in the few days before the Spring Festival. At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperative well organized the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, and organized two small-scale materials exchange fairs, selling 19.5 million yuan worth of goods. Farmers with surplus grain also sold their grain for production investment. For example, Yao Yuanlin bought a head of livestock and sold 370 jin of wheat to the supply and marketing cooperative. The supply and marketing cooperative also supplied raw grain in a planned way to workshops such as flour mills, tofu workshops, and vinegar workshops; some of the non-raw grains exchanged by the workshops for finished products were also sold to the supply and marketing cooperative. For example, in January, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied Chang Yuzhu, who made tofu, with 91 jin of beans, and he sold 82 jin of miscellaneous grains to the cooperative. This enlivened the rural economy and was conducive to the development of rural grain planned supply work.

    太谷县上庄乡供销社组织群众互相调剂粮食
    山西省太谷县上庄乡完成粮食计划收购任务以后，供销合作社及时地组织群众进行余粮户与缺粮户和不同粮种的调剂工作，活跃了农村经济。仅在一月份一个月中，供销合作社即收购了粮食二万三千多斤；供应缺粮户和组织群众互相调剂的粮食有四千二百多斤，供应粉房、豆腐房等作坊三千三百多斤原料粮。
    在粮食计划收购工作结束时，由于对群众有余粮可互通有无等政策宣传得不够全面和深入，部分群众曾一度产生了一些思想顾虑，农村经济有些不够活跃。如农民白单有多余的高粱换不到豆子；萧娃想卖些粮食给老婆买花布，但怕别人说他过去不卖给国家，是落后。当地工作干部和中共乡支部研究了这种情况以后，就对群众说明过去卖给国家粮食是光荣的，现在把余粮拿出来进行调剂也是很好的，并说明农民拿余粮进行少量的互通有无的交易是国家所允许的。群众全面地了解了国家的粮食政策以后，粮食很快就周转开了。供销合作社一天就能收购几百斤粮食，春节前几天每天还能收到一千斤以上。同时，供销合作社很好地组织了生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，共组织两次小型物资交流会，卖了一千九百五十万元的货物，有余粮的农民也卖出了自己的粮食进行生产投资。如要元林买了一头牲口，就卖给供销合作社三百七十斤小麦。对于粉房、豆腐房和醋房等作坊，供销合作社也有计划地供应了原料粮；作坊用成品换来的非原料粮有些也卖给了供销合作社。如在一月份，供销合作社供给作豆腐的常玉珠九十一斤豆子，他卖给合作社八十二斤杂粮。这样便活跃了农村经济，并有利于农村粮食计划供应工作的开展。
