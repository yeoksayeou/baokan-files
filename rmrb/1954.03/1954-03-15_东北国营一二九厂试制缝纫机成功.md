    Northeast State-owned Factory 129 Successfully Trial-Produces Sewing Machines
    Northeast State-owned Factory 129 has successfully trial-produced sewing machines, marking the first batch of complete sewing machines manufactured within the Northeast region.
    With the increasing participation of women in both urban and rural areas in social production, clothing, which was previously mainly hand-sewn by families, is gradually shifting towards machine production; in particular, more and more rural women are learning machine sewing techniques, and many rural women are treating machine sewing as a regular sideline production. Therefore, the sales volume of sewing machines in various regions has increased rapidly. State-owned commercial enterprises throughout the region purchased more than 1,300 units from within the customs (i.e. other areas of China) in the fourth quarter of last year alone; however, this is still far from meeting the needs of the broad masses. Some private merchants are taking the opportunity to transport some low-quality sewing machines into the market to pass them off as good products and make high profits.
    State-owned Factory 129 began trial-producing sewing machines in the first quarter of this year. Workers and technicians studied the characteristics of various brands of sewing machines and trial-produced the first batch of samples in February. After trial use by state-owned commercial departments, this batch of sewing machines proved to be not only effective but also of superior quality to the products of some private factories in Shanghai due to the superior materials and technical equipment used.
    After seeing the sewing machines trial-produced by Factory 129, the department stores wholesale stations in various regions of Northeast China placed orders with the factory one after another, and a plan for ordering 1,500 units in the second quarter has now been proposed. (Li Jiyao)

    东北国营一二九厂试制缝纫机成功
    东北国营一二九厂试制缝纫机成功，这是东北区内成套制造的第一批缝纫机。
    随着城乡妇女参加社会生产的不断增多，过去主要是家庭手工缝纫的衣着服饰逐渐转向靠机器生产来供应；特别是农村妇女学习机器缝纫技术的越来越多，好多农村妇女都把机器缝纫当成常年的副业生产。所以，各地缝纫机的销售量增长得很快。全区国营商业仅在去年第四季度就从关内购进一千三百多台；但还远不能满足广大群众的需要。有些私商便趁机贩运进来一些质量低劣的缝纫机在市场滥竽充数，牟取高利。
    国营一二九厂自今年第一季度开始试制缝纫机，工人和技术人员们研究了各种牌子缝纫机的特点，在二月里试制出第一批样品。这批缝纫机经国营商业部门试用证明：不仅效能良好，且由于材料和技术设备的优越，产品的质量也优于上海某些私营工厂的产品。
    东北各地区百货批发站看过一二九厂试制的缝纫机之后，纷纷向该厂订货，现已提出第二季度订货一千五百台的计划。　（李继尧）
