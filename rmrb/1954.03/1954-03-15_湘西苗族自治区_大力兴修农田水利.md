Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region
Vigorously Constructs Farmland Irrigation

The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region in Hunan Province is vigorously constructing small-scale farmland irrigation projects, which will provide irrigation to over 50,000 mu of terraced fields. This year, the People's Government has allocated over 2 billion yuan for water conservancy construction and dispatched technical personnel to build and renovate more than 20 small reservoirs and dams in Sangzhi, Yongshun, Dayong, Huayuan, Fenghuang, and other counties in the upper reaches of the Lishui River and the Yuan River tributary—the region's main grain-producing areas. In the Xiangxi area, more than half of the rice paddies are on hillsides. In the past, these paddies relied on rainwater irrigation, and therefore were often threatened by drought. Since liberation, the People's Government has led the farmers of all ethnic groups to build water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 850,000 mu. Last winter, the People's Government conducted surveying and design work for the construction of reservoirs and dams in the upper reaches of the Lishui River and began construction at the end of last year. Now all the projects are nearing completion. The Yongshun County Shanmu River area project, which started construction last year, has now entered the second phase of construction, with plans to build five large dams, more than 4,000 meters of dikes, and so on. In addition, the People's Government, based on the drought resistance experience of farmers in the mountainous areas, is vigorously promoting the digging of "ox-trapped ponds" (small ponds). At present, more than 1,000 "ox-trapped ponds" have been dug throughout the region. These "ox-trapped ponds" not only overcome the difficulty of water shortage in hillside terraces but also allow for planting lotus roots and raising fish, increasing farmers' sideline income.

    湘西苗族自治区
    大力兴修农田水利
    湖南省湘西苗族自治区正在兴修小型农田水利，有五万多亩山田将得到灌溉。今年人民政府拨发了二十多亿元的水利建设经费，派出了技术人员，在澧水上游和沅江支流——自治区的粮食主要产区桑植、永顺、大庸、花垣、凤凰等县新建和整修二十多个小型水库和水坝等。湘西地区有半数以上的稻田在山坡上。这些稻田过去是靠雨水灌溉的，因此常受干旱威胁。解放后，人民政府领导各族农民兴修水利，已扩大了灌溉面积八十五万多亩。去年冬天，人民政府在澧水上游一带进行了兴修水库、水坝的勘测和设计工作，并在去年年底动工兴修。现在全部工程将近结束。去年开始动工兴修的永顺县杉木河一带工程，现已进入第二期施工，计划要修好五座大坝、四千多公尺堤防线等。此外，人民政府还根据山区农民原有的抗旱经验，大力推广挖“牛困塘”（小水塘）。现在全区已挖好的“牛困塘”有一千多口，这些“牛困塘”不但能克服山坡梯田缺水的困难，而且可以栽藕、养鱼，增加农民副业收入。　（新华社）
