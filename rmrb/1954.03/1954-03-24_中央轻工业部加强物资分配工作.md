The Central Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government strengthened the allocation of materials in the first quarter of this year, turning some light industrial products from post-production sales to pre-production balance. On the one hand, it promoted production, and on the other hand, it met the requirements of the departments in need, so that both producers and consumers could be unaffected by market price fluctuations. For example, the actual allocation of automobile inner tubes from state-owned factories in the first quarter of this year was 109% of the production plan; wood pulp and reed pulp were 103% of the production plan. In addition, the units' needs for automobile tires, flat belts, wood pulp, reed pulp, newsprint, paper reels, cement bag paper, book paper, and other products in the first quarter were 100% met.

The variety of materials allocated by the Central Ministry of Light Industry has increased this year. Last year, the Ministry of Light Industry only allocated three categories of six types of materials, but this year it has added six more types of materials. Before some newly added varieties were allocated, production and demand were often disconnected. For example, in the autumn of last year, a paper mill had a backlog of 170,000 reels of paper, but at the same time, there was a shortage in the market. Another situation is that the so-called "brand-name" goods are out of stock, while the so-called "inferior brand" goods cannot be sold. After unified allocation, these abnormal phenomena were overcome. Secondly, the number of applicant units has increased, and the scope of allocation has expanded. Last year, the six types of materials of the Ministry of Light Industry were only allocated to state-owned enterprises and institutions directly under the central government. This year, the scope of allocation has been expanded to state-owned enterprises, cooperative enterprises, and joint state-private enterprises in provinces and cities, expanding the combination of production and demand. At the same time, the Ministry of Light Industry has also adopted methods such as processing and ordering for private enterprises. For example, for large-size automobile tires, the production quantity of state-owned factories could not meet the needs. After processing in private factories, this problem was initially solved.

After the Ministry of Light Industry strengthened the allocation of materials, some production units further exerted their production potential. The newsprint and cement bag paper produced by state-owned paper mills in Southwest China used to be in long-term backlog and production reduction. After on-site balance in the first quarter of this year, a part was transferred out, and the production situation quickly improved. The Jiangsu Wuxi Local Public-Private Joint Venture Paper Mill had not solved the problem of newsprint backlog for a whole year last year, but the problem was solved after being included in the allocation plan this year. Secondly, the implementation of the allocation system can also promote production units to reduce production costs. In the past, some production units failed to complete their production plans or had a backlog of products, which made capital turnover difficult and even increased bank loan interest and warehouse storage costs, increasing costs. Now, not only will there be no backlog of products, but also the production task can be overfulfilled, production costs lowered and the profit plan guaranteed. In addition, it can also allow producers and consumers to meet directly, which reduces commodity turnover, saves national transportation capacity, and allows the opinions of the departments in need to be reflected to the production departments in a timely manner, further improving production.

    中央轻工业部加强物资分配工作
    中央人民政府轻工业部，今年第一季度加强了物资分配工作，使部分轻工业产品由产后推销变成产前平衡，一方面推动了生产，另一方面满足了需要部门的要求，使产需双方都可不受市场价格变动的影响。如各国营厂汽车内胎，今年第一季度实际分配数为生产计划的百分之一百零九；木浆、苇浆为生产计划的百分之一百零三。又如各单位第一季度需要的汽车轮胎、平型带、木浆、苇浆、新闻纸、盘纸、水泥袋纸、书籍纸等产品，都百分之百地满足了需要。
    中央轻工业部今年分配品种增加了。去年轻工业部分配的物资只有三类六种，今年又增加了六种物资。有些新增加的品种在没有实行分配以前，生产与需要往往脱节。例如去年秋天，某纸厂积压了十七万盘盘纸，但同时市场上却发生了脱销现象。另外还有一种情况，就是所谓“名牌”货脱销，所谓“次牌”货卖不出去。这些产品经统一分配后，就克服了上述不正常的现象。其次是申请单位增加了，分配范围扩大了。去年轻工业部六种物资只分配给中央所属的国营企业及事业机关，今年分配范围扩大到省、市国营企业、合作社企业、公私合营企业等，扩大了产需的结合。同时轻工业部又采取对私营企业进行加工订货等办法，如大规格汽车轮胎，国营工厂生产数量不能满足需要，经向私营工厂加工后，初步解决了这个问题。
    轻工业部加强物资分配工作后，使有些生产单位进一步发挥了生产潜力。西南地方国营纸厂生产的新闻纸、水泥袋纸，过去长期积压、减产，今年第一季度就地平衡后，调出来一部分，生产情况迅速好转。江苏无锡地方公私合营纸厂，去年一年新闻纸积压问题没有解决，今年列入分配计划后，问题就解决了。其次，实行分配制度，还可以促进生产单位降低生产成本。过去某些生产单位因为生产计划完不成或产品积压，就使资金周转不灵，甚至加大了银行贷款利息和仓库保管费用，增加了成本；现在不仅不会积压产品，而且可以超额完成生产任务，降低成本，保证完成利润计划。此外，还可以使产、需双方直接见面，既减少了商品周转，节省了国家运输力，又可使需要部门的意见及时反映到生产部门，进一步改进生产。（杜子端　王保林）
