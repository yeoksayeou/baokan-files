　　Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, March 15th: "Cuu Quoc" (National Salvation) newspaper, the organ of the Vietnam National United Front, recently published an article supporting the upcoming Geneva Conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China.
　　After recounting the remarkable achievements of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in their struggle against the common enemy, "Cuu Quoc" pointed out: Due to these achievements made by the people of the three countries, due to the enthusiastic support given by the people of the world to their just struggle, due to the vigorous anti-war movement in France, and due to the utmost firmness shown by the Soviet Foreign Minister at the Berlin Conference, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France finally had no choice but to agree to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina with representatives from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and directly related countries. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fully support this Geneva Conference.
　　"Cuu Quoc" said: Although the French colonialists and the American imperialists have expressed their agreement to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, they are, on the other hand, continuing and expanding the war of aggression in the Indochinese peninsula, which shows that their agreement is indeed very reluctant. The American warmongers have taken further steps and are intensifying their interference in the Indochina War. They have shamelessly dispatched hundreds of air force personnel to assist the French colonialists and openly dispatched American aircraft directly from their air force bases to massacre the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. "Cuu Quoc" said: The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fully support the statement issued by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hoang Minh Giam, on March 9 this year, protesting the U.S. government's dispatch of air force personnel to expand interference in the Indochina War.
　　Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Tokyo dispatch: "Akahata" (Red Flag), the organ of the Japanese Communist Party, published an editorial on the 8th, commenting on the Geneva Conference.
　　The editorial pointed out that the convening of the Geneva Conference is of great significance for easing international tensions and restoring peace in Asia and Japan. Holding a de facto five-power conference with the participation of the great People's Republic of China signifies the victory of the idea and movement of people of all countries who hope to resolve all international issues through consultation. The Japanese people are excited about the convening of this conference and gain great courage from it. The convening of this conference will become a new and great source of encouragement for millions of people to rise up together to carry out the struggle to defend peace. The editorial exposed the U.S. plot to make the Geneva Conference fail. The editorial pointed out that the recent U.S. preparations to sign a military agreement with Pakistan, as well as forcing Japan to sign the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," powerfully prove that although the U.S. has been forced to hold consultations under the pressure of world public opinion, it absolutely does not hope to ease international tensions and peacefully resolve Asian issues.
　　The editorial said that the Japanese people's attitude towards the Geneva Conference is to support the success of this conference. We must correctly tell the people the significance of this conference, and we must expose the U.S. plot to make this conference fail. We must further strengthen the people's struggle for peace in order to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference, strive for the restoration of peace, national reunification, and independence in Korea and Indochina, and strive for the peaceful settlement of Asian and Japanese issues.

    越南“救国报”和日本“赤旗报”分别撰文
    支持召开日内瓦会议协商解决国际问题
    【新华社十六日讯】据越南通讯社北越十五日讯：越南国民联合战线机关报“救国报”最近发表一篇文章，支持即将召开的有中华人民共和国参加的日内瓦会议。
    “救国报”在追述了越南、高棉和寮国三国人民由于在反对共同敌人的斗争中取得的突出的成就之后指出：由于三国人民所取得的这些成就，由于全世界人民对他们的正义斗争所给予的热烈支持，由于法国国内开展了强有力的反战运动，由于苏联外交部长在柏林会议上所表现的最大的坚定，美国、英国和法国政府终于不得不同意与苏联、中华人民共和国以及直接有关的国家的代表一同讨论有关恢复印度支那和平的问题。越南、高棉和寮国人民完全支持这个日内瓦会议。
    “救国报”说：虽然法国殖民主义者和美国帝国主义者表示同意在日内瓦会议上讨论有关恢复印度支那和平的问题，但是另一方面他们还在继续进行和扩大印度支那半岛的侵略战争，这表明了他们的同意实在很勉强。美国战争贩子已经采取了更进一步的步骤，并且更加紧地干涉印度支那战争。他们厚颜无耻地派遣了数百名空军人员帮助法国殖民主义者，并且公开地从他们的空军基地派遣美国飞机直接屠杀越南、高棉和寮国人民。“救国报”说：越南、高棉和寮国三国人民完全支持越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴今年三月九日所发表的抗议美国政府派遣空军人员扩大干涉印度支那战争的声明。
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”八日发表社论，评论日内瓦会议。
    社论指出，日内瓦会议的召开，对缓和国际紧张局势，恢复亚洲和日本和平具有十分重大的意义。举行有伟大的中华人民共和国参加的实际上的五大国会议，就意味着希望和平的各国人民要求用协商方式解决一切国际问题的思想和运动的胜利。日本人民对于这个会议的召开感到兴奋并从中获得很大的勇气。这个会议的召开将成为千千万万人一同起来进行保卫和平斗争的新的巨大的鼓舞力量。社论揭露美国企图使日内瓦会议失败的阴谋。社论指出，最近美国准备要和巴基斯坦签订军事协定，以及强迫日本签订美日“共同防御援助协定”，这些都有力地证明美国虽然在世界舆论压力下被迫举行协商会议，但是它绝不希望缓和国际紧张局势和和平解决亚洲问题。
    社论说，日本人民对日内瓦会议的态度是支持这个会议获得成功。我们必须把这个会议的意义正确地告诉给人民，必须揭露美国企图使这个会议失败的阴谋。我们必须进一步加强人民争取和平的斗争，以争取日内瓦会议获得成功，争取朝鲜、印度支那恢复和平、民族统一和独立，争取亚洲问题和日本问题的和平解决。
