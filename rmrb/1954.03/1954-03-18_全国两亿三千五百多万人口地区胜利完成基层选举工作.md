    Primary-Level Election Work Successfully Completed in Areas with a Population of Over 235 Million Nationwide

    Since February and March of this year, primary-level elections in various localities have been comprehensively launched, combined with industrial and agricultural production and the publicity and education of the general line. Due to the strengthening of leadership by election committees at all levels and the extensive mobilization and organization of the people to exercise their democratic rights, the movement has progressed rapidly. As of March 10th, 87,766 primary-level units, covering a population of over 235 million, had completed the elections nationwide; elections are underway in another 62,945 primary-level units. The provinces of Jilin, Songjiang, Rehe, Qinghai, and Xikang, as well as the nine central municipalities of Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Changchun, Harbin, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Chongqing, have all completed primary-level elections.

    During the general election movement, people over the age of eighteen, with the exception of a small number who were deprived of political rights according to law or who were unable to exercise the right to vote and be elected due to mental illness, equally enjoyed democratic rights. The broad masses of the people attached great importance to their rights and participated in the elections with great enthusiasm. According to statistics from 5,846 primary-level units in 27 provinces, 30 cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the average voter turnout reached 88 percent of the total number of voters.

    Through the election work, the proportion of the working class in the basic-level People's Congresses and basic-level political power has been greatly increased, and the people's democratic united front has been further consolidated. According to statistics from Tianjin, the working class accounts for 69.9 percent of the elected people's representatives; among the 160 district heads, deputy district heads, and members of the district people's government elected in the city, the working class accounts for more than 63 percent, while industrialists and businessmen, cultural and educational circles, handicraftsmen, and other strata account for 36 percent. People's representatives from all strata have expressed that after attending the People's Congress, they will unite better under the leadership of Chairman Mao and strive to realize the general line of the state during the transition period. In ethnic minority areas, national unity has also been further strengthened after the general election. In Xiawozhai, Chenliang Township, Guizhu County, Guizhou Province, the general election was combined with education on ethnic minority policies, exposing the landlords' divisive conspiracies and eliminating years of estrangement between the Yi and Miao peoples, strengthening unity. Many areas inhabited by ethnic minorities have implemented ethnic regional autonomy after the general election. Zhalanmu Village in Fuxin County, Liaoxi Province, designated the date of the first village People's Congress as the anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous village and thanked Chairman Mao for his concern with actions such as actively paying public grain and enthusiastically selling surplus grain.

    全国两亿三千五百多万人口地区胜利完成基层选举工作
    【新华社十七日讯】我国基层选举工作目前已在二亿三千五百多万人口地区胜利完成。
    从今年二、三月以来，各地基层选举都结合工业、农业生产和总路线的宣传教育陆续全面展开。由于各级选举委员会加强了对这项工作的领导，广泛地动员和组织人民行使他们的民主权利，运动迅速进展。到三月十日统计，全国完成选举的已有八万七千七百六十六个基层单位，包括二亿三千五百多万人口；另有六万二千九百四十五个基层单位选举正在展开。全国已经全部完成基层选举的地区有吉林、松江、热河、青海、西康等五个省和旅大、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、长春、哈尔滨、西安、上海、重庆等九个中央直辖市。
    在普选运动中，各地除了少数人依法被剥夺政治权利，或因患有精神病不能行使选举权和被选举权的以外，十八周岁以上的人民都平等地享受了民主权利。广大人民都十分重视他们的权利，并以极高的热情参加了选举。根据全国二十七个省、三十个市和内蒙古自治区共五千八百四十六个基层单位的统计，参加选举的选民平均达到选民总数的百分之八十八。
    经过选举工作，在基层人民代表大会和基层政权中工人阶级成分的比重大大增强，并进一步巩固了人民民主统一战线。根据天津市的统计，选出的人民代表中，工人阶级成分占百分之六十九点九；全市选出的一百六十个区长、副区长和区人民政府委员中，工人阶级成分占百分之六十三以上，工商业者、文教界、手工业者及其他阶层成分占百分之三十六。各阶层人民代表在开过人民代表大会以后，都表示要在毛主席的领导下，更好地团结，为实现国家在过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。在少数民族地区，普选以后民族团结也进一步加强了。贵州省贵筑县陈亮乡小窝寨在普选中，结合民族政策的教育，揭破了地主的分裂阴谋，使彝、苗两族人民消除了多年的隔阂，加强了团结。许多少数民族聚居地区经过普选以后实行了民族区域自治。辽西省阜新县札兰木村把首次村人民代表大会召开的日子，订为自治村成立纪念日，并以积极交纳公粮、踊跃出售余粮等行动来感谢毛主席对他们的关怀。
