    Indian MPs Condemn U.S.-Pakistan Military Treaty
    New Delhi, Xinhua News Agency: During a foreign policy debate in the People's Chamber of the Indian Parliament on the 23rd, MPs from various parties and independent MPs strongly condemned the U.S. conspiracy to invade South Asia. Communist Party of India MP Mukherjee pointed out that all the people of India oppose U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan. He called on the Indian people to be vigilant against the various activities of U.S. special agents in India. Mukherjee also called on the Indian people to be vigilant towards all kinds of U.S. visitors, because they all come to India under the auspices of the "Ford Foundation" and other such ambitious groups.
    Independent MP Maskarini accused the United States of undermining Indo-Pakistani friendly relations. She also said: No one believes that the U.S. "military observers" sent to Kashmir are neutral.
    People's Socialist Party MP Das said: The United States now hopes to turn Asia into the first line of defense for the United States. But we are absolutely unwilling to be cannon fodder to protect the United States. We want to protect our own country.
    On the 24th, the People's Chamber continued to debate foreign policy. Communist Party MP Punos said: The serious threat to India at present is the U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan. Punos warned people to prevent U.S. interference in India's internal affairs, and read out a statement by an MP of the Indian Parliament's Federal Chamber, which pointed out that the U.S. Ambassador to India had asked the MP to follow the political line instructed by the United States.
    Independent MP Lanka Sundaram said that the U.S. authorities "guaranteed" that the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty was not aimed at India, but this "guarantee" was meaningless and untrue. In his speech, he also warned people to pay attention to the U.S. conspiracy to create a coup in India, saying that this conspiracy is doomed to failure.
    Congress Party MP Basappa said when talking about the activities of foreign missionaries that their activities must be closely watched. He said that some missionaries are carrying out divisive activities in the border areas of Assam and other provinces.

    无党无派议员朗卡·松达拉姆说，美国当局“保证”美巴军事条约不是用来对付印度的，但是这种“保证”毫无意义也毫不确实。他在发言中并警告人们注意美国企图在印度制造政变的阴谋，他说这种阴谋注定要失败。
