    Organize Cultural and Artistic Workers to Widely Publicize the General Line
    Writers Participate in the Publicity Work for the "Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition"
    The Chinese Writers Association, at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, recently organized a group of writers to participate in the publicity work for the "Anshan Iron and Steel Works Technical Innovation Exhibition" to be held in Beijing.
    Those participating in this work include Feng Zhi, Huang Yaomian, Wu Zuxiang, and Xiao Yin. They left Beijing for Anshan a few days ago for interviews, for approximately two weeks. In addition, the Chinese Writers Association also organized writers Shu Qun, Cao Ming, Luo Dan, and Xie Tingyu, who are currently experiencing life in Anshan, to participate in the publicity work for the exhibition.
      The Taiping Drum Team Welcomed by Farmers
    In the Sixth District of Andong County, Liaodong Province, the local folk dance Taiping Drum was used in the publicity of the general line. A Taiping Drum team was formed by folk artists who knew how to perform the Taiping Drum, and seven storytelling programs were created with the content of publicizing the general line, developing mutual aid and cooperation, and selling surplus grain. They performed mobile performances in various villages in the district, which were very popular among the farmers.
    In the month before the Spring Festival, the Taiping Drum team performed more than 20 shows, with a total audience of more than 8,000 people. When the Women's Federation of Luanjia Village held a meeting, the women cadres specially invited the Taiping Drum team to perform for them to publicize the general line. They were warmly welcomed by the farmers wherever they went. Almost every family left only one person to watch the house, and the rest came to listen to their performances; therefore, some women who did not usually attend meetings also received an education on the general line through this performance. Because their performances were simple, vivid, and in a form that was popular with the masses, they achieved good results. Ma Zhongchen, a farmer in Xinli Village, listened to the performance three times in a row. He said, "What you said is right, only by organizing can we take the road to common prosperity." After their performance in Gaoqiao Village, six individual households were already considering forming mutual aid teams.
    Let "Peasant Entertainment" Live On
    The folk art organizations and folk artists in Shahe and Xingtai Counties, Hebei Province, showed positive and happy moods in the publicity of the general line. Folk arts that had not been active for more than 20 years, and even were on the verge of being lost, have become active again. Such as the folk songs and dances "Xiao Chaochao" and "Bamboo Horse" in Shahe County, the folk dances "Shua Hu" and "Datou" and the folk songs and dances "Dayangge" in Xingtai County, etc., were all excavated in this literary and artistic publicity movement. Each performance was attended by crowds of people. The folk artists who participated in the performances were all over sixty or seventy years old. They said: "To celebrate our country's general line of construction, to celebrate the year of harvest and victory, we also have to sell our old bones and show off some old tricks." They also said: "These peasant entertainment are all passed down by our peasants. The Communist Party and the People's Government value it, and the folks like it. We must not let it be lost, but pass it on to the younger generation and let it live on!" (He Xingmin)
    "I'll never be indecisive again!"
    The Spring Festival Entertainment Activity Committee of Lidien District, Xishui County, Hubei Province, organized mobile propaganda teams to tour various townships during the Spring Festival to publicize the general line to farmers. The propaganda team mainly used picture exhibitions, costumed speeches, and slide shows as the main means of publicity, and also performed short literary and artistic programs such as lotus boats and clapper talks. The mobile propaganda team went to the countryside for six days, exhibiting pictures such as "Taking the Happy Road of the Soviet Union" thirteen times, showing slides such as "Happy Youth in the Soviet Union" four times, and performing fifty-four times, with an audience of about 10,000 people. After the publicity, the ideological awareness of the farmers has been improved, and their confidence in building a socialist society has been strengthened. An old lady in Shengli Township decided to ask her son to join the mutual aid team and sell more grain to the state after watching "Taking the Happy Road of the Soviet Union." A farmer in Daoqiao Township said after seeing the pictures promoting mutual aid and cooperation: "In the past, I joined the mutual aid team in a muddle. After seeing the exhibition, I realized that joining the mutual aid team is a broad road to socialism. I will never be indecisive again!" (Gang Shi, Yao Qing)

    组织文化艺术工作者广泛宣传总路线
    作家们参加“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的宣传工作
    中国作家协会最近应中华全国总工会的邀请，特组织了一批作家参加即将在北京举行的“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的宣传工作。
    参加这项工作的有冯至、黄药眠、吴组缃、萧殷等，他们已在日前从北京去鞍山采访。时间约为两星期。另外，中国作家协会还组织了正在鞍山体验生活的作家舒群、草明、罗丹、谢挺宇等也参加展览会的宣传工作。
      受到农民欢迎的太平鼓队
    辽东省安东县第六区，在总路线的宣传中，运用了当地流传的民间歌舞太平鼓。由会表演太平鼓的民间艺人组成了一个太平鼓队，并以宣传总路线、发展互助合作、卖余粮等为内容编了七个说唱节目，在该区各村进行流动演出，很受农民欢迎。
    太平鼓队在春节前的一个月中，先后演唱了二十余场，观众共达八千余人次。栾家村妇女会开会时，妇女干部特意请太平鼓队来给她们演唱，宣传总路线。他们每到一村，都受到了农民的热烈欢迎，差不多每家都只留一个看家的，其余的人都来听他们的演唱；因此，一向不参加会议的部分妇女，通过这次演唱，也受到了一次总路线的教育。由于他们的演唱通俗生动，形式又为群众所喜闻乐见，所以收到了较好的效果。新立村的农民马忠臣，一连听了三次。他说：“你们说的真对，只有组织起来，才能走大家共同富裕的道路。”他们在高桥村演出之后，有六家单干户已酝酿成立互助组。
    让“庄稼玩艺”活下去
    河北沙河、邢台两县的民间艺术组织和民间艺人，在这次总路线的宣传中，表现了积极愉快的心情。二十多年没有活动的、甚至将要失传的民间艺术，都活跃起来了。如沙河县的民间歌舞“小吵吵”、“竹马”，邢台县的民间舞蹈“耍虎”、“大头”和民间歌舞“大秧歌”等，都是在这次文艺宣传运动中挖掘出来的。每次演出，观众都是人山人海。参加表演的民间艺人，都有六七十岁以上的年纪了。他们说：“为庆贺咱们国家建设的总路线，为庆贺丰收胜利年，我们也要卖卖老，耍一套老玩艺。”还说：“这些庄稼玩艺，都是咱们庄稼人们传下来的，共产党和人民政府重视它，老乡们喜欢它，决不能让它失传，要传授给年轻人，使它活下去！”　　　　　（贺兴敏）
    “再也不三心二意了！”
    湖北浠水县里店区春节文娱活动委员会，于春节期内，组织了流动宣传队巡回各乡，向农民宣传总路线。该宣传队以展出图片、化妆演讲、放映幻灯等为主要宣传方式，并配合演出采莲船、快板等短小文艺节目。流动宣传队下乡六天，展出“走苏联的幸福道路”等图片十三次，放映“苏联幸福的青年”等幻灯片四次，演唱了五十四次，观众约有一万多人。经过宣传，农民的思想觉悟得到提高，加强了他们建设社会主义社会的信心。胜利乡的一个老大娘看了“走苏联的幸福道路”后，决心要叫儿子参加互助组，要多打粮食卖给国家。道桥乡一个农民看了宣传互助合作的图片后说：“过去参加互助组是糊里糊涂的，看过展览，才知道参加互助组是走向社会主义的一条大路，我再也不三心二意了！”　　　　　（钢石、耀卿）
