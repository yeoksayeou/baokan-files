    Hunan Province Plans to Restore and Develop 100,000 Mu of Oil-Tea Forests This Year
    The Forestry Bureau of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, based on the needs of the state and the people, plans to restore and develop 100,000 mu of oil-tea forests this year, requiring a 25% increase in production. The focus will be on seven counties, including Leiyang, Yongxing, Hengshan, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Jishou, and Fenghuang, to restore 70,000 mu of oil-tea forests. In five counties, including Hengshan, Hengnan, Leiyang, Qidong, and Chenxian, where transportation is convenient, there is no conflict with the development of timber forests, the masses have a habit of managing oil-tea, and the terrain is not too steep, the focus will be on developing 30,000 mu. In order to ensure the smooth progress of this work, the Forestry Bureau has sent working groups to key oil-tea producing areas such as Leiyang to investigate and summarize the masses' experience in managing oil-tea, in order to guide the work. It has also decided to use the State-owned Changde Forest Farm as a oil-tea demonstration forest farm to conduct experiments on oil-tea afforestation, protection, and cultivation. In addition, low-interest loans and rewards will be issued through various economic departments to encourage mass production enthusiasm.
    Currently, many regions are actively carrying out oil-tea restoration work. The Leiyang County People's Government has appointed full-time cadres to lead the masses to seize the time to dig out oil-tea pests. Pingjiang County has allocated more than 70 million yuan for mountain reclamation and nurturing, and plans to repair and nurture more than 890 mu of oil-tea forests in the spring. The county's mountain reclamation work has been widely carried out. In the Huangjindong area, more than 100 laborers are reclaiming mountains, reclaiming more than 200 mu of oil-tea forests. Yang Zhenxi's mutual aid group in Jishou County combined mountain repair and nurturing with burning grass and wood ash, yielding eight dan, and two dan of charcoal, which has motivated many farmers to actively repair the mountains.
    The tea oil produced by oil-tea trees can be used as raw materials for soap and candles, as well as machine lubricating oil, in addition to being edible, and oil cake can be used as fertilizer. Hunan Province is one of the main tea oil producing areas in China, producing approximately 600,000 dan annually, which occupies a very important position in the rural economy. According to a survey: The oil-tea area in Longshan Township, Hengshan County, is only seven mu less than the paddy field area. The first group in the township has an average of only 1.5 mu of field per person, but has nearly 3 mu of tea seed mountains. In the Bailuao area of Leiyang, some farmers' tea oil income accounts for one-third of their total income, so the broad masses of farmers actively respond to the government's call to restore oil-tea forests.

    湖南省今年计划恢复和发展油茶林十万亩
    湖南省人民政府林业局根据国家和人民的需要，计划今年恢复和发展油茶林十万亩，要求增产百分之二十五。以耒阳、永兴、衡山、平江、浏阳、吉首、凤凰等七县为重点，恢复油茶林七万亩。并在交通方便、与发展用材林不冲突、群众有经营油茶习惯与地势坡度不大的衡山、衡南、耒阳、祁东、郴县等五县，重点发展三万亩。为了使这一工作顺利进行，林业局已派出工作组到耒阳等油茶重点产区进行调查和总结群众经营油茶经验，以便指导工作。并决定以国营常德林场为油茶示范林场，进行油茶的造林、保护和抚育实验。此外，还将通过各经济部门发放低利贷款和进行奖励等，以鼓励群众生产积极性。
    目前，许多地区都在积极进行恢复油茶工作。耒阳县人民政府已指定专职干部，领导群众抓紧时间挖油茶害虫。平江县拨出七千多万元垦山抚育费，计划在春季修抚油茶林八百九十多亩。该县垦山工作已普遍展开，黄金洞全区共有一百多个劳动力垦山，垦出油茶林二百多亩，吉首县杨振喜互助组结合修山抚育烧草木灰八担，炭两担，带动了很多农户也积极修山。
    油茶树所产的茶油，除食用外，还可以作肥皂和蜡烛的原料以及机器润滑油，油枯可作肥料。湖南省是我国茶油主要产地之一，每年约产六十万担，在农村经济中占很重要地位。据调查：衡山县龙山乡油茶面积比水田只少七亩，该乡第一组平均每人只有一亩五分田，却有将近三亩茶子山。耒阳白露坳一带有些农民茶油收入占总收入三分之一，所以广大农民对政府号召恢复油茶林都积极响应。（龙楠林）
