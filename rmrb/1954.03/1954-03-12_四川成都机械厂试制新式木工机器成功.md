The Sichuan Provincial State-owned Chengdu Machinery Factory has successfully trial-produced new Soviet-style products, including woodworking lathes, four-sided planers, pendulum saws, and self-designed circular saws. Some of these new products have been successively shipped to Beijing, Anshan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Zhuzhou, and other places for construction use.

The successful trial production of these new products has paved the way for mechanization for model workers in the machinery manufacturing industry and carpenters in the construction industry. A woodworking lathe operated by one person is equivalent to the work efficiency of twelve people; if calculated at the maximum planing capacity, a four-sided planer can plane more than 10,300 square meters of wood per day, equivalent to the work efficiency of more than 1,200 people; a circular saw is equivalent to seventeen hand saws, which is equivalent to the work efficiency of thirty-five people.

Many workers in the factory have made outstanding contributions to the trial production of these new products. After inspection, the precision of these new products meets the specifications, and the performance also meets the requirements. Labor model Yang Yunde happily said when he saw batches of machines he had personally manufactured being shipped to various places: "As long as we work actively and use our brains to find tricks, the journey to socialism will be shortened." When fitter Wei Yongyu saw the four-sided planer he had personally assembled during the test run, with wood shavings constantly flying up, he excitedly said: "I didn't believe that machines could plane all four sides of wood at once before, but now I believe it. The things from the Soviet big brother are really good, fast, and high-quality, which has added strength to our country's socialist construction!"

    四川成都机械厂试制新式木工机器成功
    四川省国营成都机械厂职工试制苏联式木工车床、四面刨木机、摆锯机以及自行设计的圆锯机等新式产品获得成功。这些新产品有的已陆续运往北京、鞍山、上海、南京、西安、株州等地，供各地进行建设使用。
    这些新产品试制成功，给机器制造业的模型工和建筑业的木工开辟了机械化的道路。一个人操纵的木工车床，相当十二人的工作效率；四面刨木机如以最大的刨量计算，每天可刨木板一万零三百多平方公尺，相当一千二百多人的工作效率；圆锯机可当十七把?锯，相当三十五人操作的工作效率。
    该厂许多工人，在试制这些新产品的工作上，都作了出色的贡献。这些新产品经检验后，精确程度合乎规范，使用效能也符合要求。劳动模范杨运德看见自己亲手制造出来的机器一批一批运往各地时高兴地说：“只要我们积极劳动，动脑筋找窍门，过渡到社会主义的路程就会缩短了。”钳工间技工魏用予看见自己亲手组合成的四面刨木机在试车时，朵朵木花不断地飞了起来，他激动地说：“以前我还不相信机器能把木板四面一下刨光，现在我才相信了。苏联老大哥的东西真是不错，又快、又好，这对我们祖国的社会主义建设又增加了力量！”
