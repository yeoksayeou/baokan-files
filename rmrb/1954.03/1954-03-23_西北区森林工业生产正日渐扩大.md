The forest industry in Northwest China is expanding production to supply various types of timber needed by factories, mines, transportation, and other basic construction sites in the Northwest region.

The forest area in Northwest China is extremely vast, with all provinces having resources available for harvesting. The Northwest Forest Industry Bureau has logging yards in all provinces (except Ningxia). Last year, it harvested more than 150,000 cubic meters of timber, supplying the timber needed for construction units in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, and vigorously supplying the timber needed by the Yumen Oil Mine.

This year, in order to massively exploit the logs in various forest areas and lay a better foundation for future exploitation, the Northwest Forest Industry Bureau is engaged in basic construction in various forest areas. The total investment in basic construction reaches more than 20 billion yuan, an increase of 2.7 times compared to last year. Among the investment funds, the Bai Longjiang Forest Area in Gansu Province receives the most. This forest area covers an area of 600,000 hectares and is a key logging area for construction materials in Northwest China, which can be mined next year. The second is the Qinling Logging Yard, which plans to produce 15,000 cubic meters of timber this year, mainly to support the timber needed for the Baoji-Chengdu Railway under construction. In total, the bureau plans to harvest more than 230,000 cubic meters of timber this year, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of logging work, the Northwest region will focus on conducting a key survey of the Bai Longjiang Forest Area this year. Through last year's survey of this forest area, the distribution of forests and their utilization value have been identified, and it has been determined that it can guarantee the supply of construction timber for the Northwest region in the future. This year, the survey will continue to develop a comprehensive management plan. According to this plan, the management and operation of the forest area will be determined, as well as how to carry out nurturing and harvesting in a planned manner. In addition, a survey of suitable afforestation land will be conducted this year. First, the Shaanxi survey team will take the lead in completing a comprehensive survey of the Shaanxi Shayuan area within March and April. Next, a nurturing survey of the Qiaoshan coppice forest area in northern Shaanxi will be carried out to formulate management plans respectively, so as to eliminate the sandy wasteland in Shayuan as soon as possible and restore the natural shelterbelt in the Yanluo area of northern Shaanxi and from Huanglong to Fuxian, and protect agricultural production. In addition, the Helan Mountains in Ningxia and the Wuchang Forest Area in Xinjiang will continue to be surveyed, and Qinghai will conduct a more in-depth investigation and understanding of the virgin forest areas.

    西北区森林工业生产正日渐扩大
    西北森林工业现正扩大生产，供应西北各工厂、矿山、运输和其他基本建设工地上所需要的各种木材。
    西北林区分布极为辽阔，各省都有可供采伐的资源。西北森林工业管理局在各省都设有伐木场（除宁夏外）。去年曾采伐十五万多立方公尺的木材，供应了陕西、甘肃和新疆等地修建单位所需的木材，并大力供应了玉门油矿所需用的木材。
    今年，西北森林工业管理局为了大量开采各林区的原木，并奠定以后更好的开采础基，正从事各林区的基本建设。基本建设投资共达二百多亿元，比去年增加了二点七倍。投资款项中，以甘肃的白龙江林区为最多，该林区面积达六十万公顷，是西北建筑用材的重点伐木区，明年即可开采。其次是秦岭伐木场，今年计划生产一万五千立方公尺的木材，主要是支援正在修建的宝成铁路所需的木材。总计该局今年计划采伐木材二十三万多立方公尺，比去年增加了百分之五十以上。
    为了保证采伐工作的顺利进行，西北今年将对白龙江林区进行重点调查。这一林区，经去年的调查，已摸清了森林分布情况和利用价值，确定可以保证供应西北区今后的建筑木料。今年继续进行调查，做出全面的施业方案，根据这个方案，决定林区的经营管理工作，以及如何有计划地进行抚育和采伐等。此外，今年还要进行宜林地调查。首先以陕西调查队为主，在三、四月内完成陕西沙苑的全面调查，接着，进行陕北桥山梢林区的抚育调查，分别作出施业方案，以便早日消灭沙苑的沙荒，恢复陕北延洛区和由黄龙到鄜县一带的天然防护林带，保护农业生产。此外，宁夏的贺兰山、新疆的乌昌林区继续进行调查，青海将对各处女林区作更深入的调查了解。
