Dingxian Special District in Hebei Province corrected the tendency of some districts and townships to reduce cotton fields.
    Leading cadres of Dingxian Special District and various counties in Hebei Province went deep into the rural areas and promptly corrected the tendency of some districts and townships to reduce cotton fields. Some district and township cadres in Dingxian Special District did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of mobilizing farmers to appropriately expand cotton fields and support national construction. Some district and township cadres were unwilling to mobilize farmers to grow more cotton, fearing that the burden would be too heavy in the future and they would be blamed. Therefore, they did not actively lead farmers to appropriately expand cotton fields. Some districts even reduced the area for cotton planting without asking for instructions from higher authorities when arranging tasks. The cotton planting plans of Xinle and Xingtang counties differed from the township cotton planting plans by more than 14,000 mu. As a result, this further increased the farmers' concerns about planting cotton. According to a preliminary investigation in the third, fourth, and fifth districts of Wuji County, half of the villages' farmers wanted to reduce the area for cotton planting. After the work teams sent to the countryside by the Special District and counties discovered the above situation, they promptly helped the district and township cadres to correct this tendency of reducing cotton fields. They conducted education on the general line for district and township cadres and farmers, pointing out that planting cotton according to the state plan is a patriotic action to support the country's industrialization; they publicized this year's cotton-grain price ratio, explained the policy that cotton planting would not lead to additional levies, and increased production would not lead to increased taxes, and in particular, they helped agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to formulate plans to appropriately expand cotton fields, leading the broad masses of farmers to appropriately expand cotton fields.

    河北定县专区纠正部分区乡缩小棉田偏向
    河北省定县专区及各县领导干部深入农村，及时纠正部分区、乡缩小棉田的偏向。定县专区有不少的区、乡干部对发动农民适当扩大棉田，支援国家建设的意义认识不足，有些区乡干部不愿意发动农民多种棉花，怕将来负担重了受埋怨，所以不积极领导农民适当扩大棉田；甚至有的区在布置任务时，不向上级请示，就擅自缩小种棉面积，新乐、行唐两县的植棉计划和乡的种棉计划相差一万四千多亩。因此，这就更增加了农民对种棉花的顾虑。据无极县三、四、五三个区的初步调查，就有半数村庄的农民要缩小种棉面积。专区、县下乡工作组发现上述情况后，就及时帮助区、乡干部纠正这种缩小棉田的偏向。他们向区、乡干部和农民进行了总路线的教育，指出按照国家计划种棉，就是支援国家工化业的爱国行动；宣传了今年的棉粮比价，讲解了种棉不加征，增产不增税的政策，特别是帮助农业生产合作社和互助组订出了适当扩大棉田的计划，带动广大农民适当扩大棉田。
