Xinhua News Agency, March 17th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is openly attempting to violate the agreement reached at the Berlin Conference and obstruct the smooth convening of the Geneva Conference. According to a dispatch from the U.S. Information Service in Washington on the 16th, Dulles suddenly stated at a press conference on the 16th that the Geneva Conference, scheduled to convene on April 26th, might be postponed.

    Dulles's remarks are a new development in the U.S. conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Conference. Since the Berlin Conference, the United States has been spreading pessimistic views about the Geneva Conference's prospects, downplaying its significance, and attempting to portray it as merely a meeting between the opposing sides in Korea. The U.S. State Department recently even publicly announced that the agreement previously signed with Syngman Rhee, originally intended to obstruct the Korean political conference, remains in effect for the Geneva Conference.

    Dulles's remarks on the 16th aroused unease and surprise in France and Britain. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 16th, French diplomatic circles "are greatly disturbed by Dulles's remarks that the Geneva Conference might be postponed. Dulles's remarks came as a complete surprise to the French Foreign Ministry." Dulles's remarks have sparked speculation in Paris as to "whether this is an American attempt to cancel the Berlin Conference agreement." According to a United Press International dispatch from Paris on the 17th, the French cabinet will hold an "unusually important" meeting on the 17th to discuss how to secure American support for a negotiated settlement of the Indochina issue. A Reuters dispatch from London on the 16th reported that British officials "were surprised" by Dulles's remarks.

    杜勒斯企图阻挠日内瓦会议的顺利召开  他的谈话在法英两国引起了不安和惊讶
   【新华社十七日讯】美国国务卿杜勒斯公然企图违反柏林会议上的协议，阻挠日内瓦会议顺利召开。据美国新闻处华盛顿十六日电报道：杜勒斯十六日在记者招待会上突然表示：预定在四月二十六日召开的日内瓦会议可能要延期。
    杜勒斯的谈话是美国企图捣乱日内瓦会议的阴谋的新的发展。在柏林会议以后，美国就一直在散布所谓日内瓦会议不会成功的悲观空气，散布缩小日内瓦会议的意义、企图把这个会议说成是朝鲜敌对双方会议的言论。美国国务院最近并公开宣布以前与李承晚签订的原来准备用来阻挠朝鲜政治会议的协议，对日内瓦会议仍然有效。
    杜勒斯十六日的谈话在法国和英国引起了不安和惊讶。据路透社巴黎十六日电报道，法国外交界人士对杜勒斯所发表的日内瓦会议可能延期举行的谈话，“感到大为不安。杜勒斯的谈话对法国外交部说来，完全是意外的事情”。杜勒斯的谈话在巴黎引起了这样一种猜测：“这是否是美国企图取消柏林会议的协议”。据合众社巴黎十七日电，法国内阁在十七日举行一次“异常重要”的会议，讨论如何使美国支持用谈判方式实现印度支那和平的做法。路透社伦敦十六日电报道，英国官员们对杜勒斯谈话“感到惊讶”。
