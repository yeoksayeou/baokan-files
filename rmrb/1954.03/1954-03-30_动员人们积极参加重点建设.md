Mobilizing People to Actively Participate in Key Construction
　　Zhang Qian

    As national construction, especially the 141 major projects aided by the Soviet Union, gradually unfolds across the country, the responsibility of newspapers in publicizing and implementing the key construction policy intensifies. Newspapers in key construction areas, in particular, must directly undertake the significant task of mobilizing and organizing the broad masses to participate in and support key construction.

    Over the past year, many newspapers have paid attention to this aspect of publicity. Some newspapers in key construction areas have even placed it in a primary and central position, providing relatively continuous and focused coverage. These newspapers have played a certain role in publicizing and implementing the key construction policy, reflecting the aspects and problems of key construction, and inspiring the laboring masses to participate in and support key construction. These achievements should be affirmed. However, this publicity is still a new issue for our newspapers, and therefore some shortcomings have arisen in the publicity, the most important of which is that the publicity is not deep enough. The Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper recently conducted a review of its publicity on key construction. Here, based on the situation reflected in the newspaper's review, some opinions are put forward on how to deepen this publicity.

    Judging from the publicity situation of Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper on the three major projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Ansteel), namely the large rolling mill, the seamless steel tube plant, and the No. 7 blast furnace, to deeply publicize key construction, it is necessary to ideologically educate and mobilize the workers and masses to actively participate in key construction, enhance their socialist consciousness, and promote their pioneering spirit, thereby inspiring the construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. In the construction teams of the three major projects in Anshan, one can see many peasants who, not long ago, were still holding hoes, but today have become skilled builders. While changing the face of construction, they are also transforming themselves. For example, in a past issue of Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, the story of Li Guilan, a female welder from the Ansteel Metal Structure Engineering Company, who overcame difficulties to learn technology, was reported. Li Guilan was only seventeen years old at the time and was a rural girl who knew nothing about technology a year ago, but now she has become a very skilled female welder. The newspaper also reported on the selfless labor spirit of the builders of the three major projects. Among them were Wang Jinzhong, who took the lead in going into the ice water to dig mud during the construction of the seamless steel tube plant; and Wang Hongfa, who disregarded his life to go into the waist-deep water to save the collapse of the pillar corner pit wall, ensuring the victory of the "pillar replacement and foundation change" project. Their selfless labor in key construction has set an example for the workers and masses. However, the number of such vivid and touching examples reflected in the newspaper is not yet very large. Many reports only focus on reflecting the business activities and engineering achievements and grandeur in construction, while neglecting to inspire the socialist consciousness of the working masses ideologically and to promote their pioneering spirit.

    In order to make the publicity of key construction a great force to promote people to better participate in or support these construction works, it is also necessary to educate people in the reports to understand the political and economic significance of developing key construction. According to the review of Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, when they carried out the publicity of the three major projects, there was a tendency to only focus on publicizing the superiority of key projects from a technical point of view, while neglecting to publicize their political and economic significance. For example, in many reports about the three major projects, they emphasized the mechanization and automation of the equipment of these factories, as well as the benefits that their superior labor conditions would bring to the workers engaged in production, but rarely paid attention to fundamentally explaining the relationship between the construction of these projects and the realization of the country's socialist industrialization, the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and the improvement of people's lives. Sometimes, even if it was mentioned, it was not comprehensive. Of course, publicizing the new technical equipment and superior labor conditions of these factories is also very necessary; but neglecting the latter makes the superiority and advancement of these factories seem to be only related to a small number of people, rather than things of great significance in the political and economic life of the people. As a result, it is difficult to specifically educate people through the publicity of key construction to understand that it is necessary to first develop heavy industry and implement the key construction policy, and to make the people participating in the construction ideologically realize that they are engaged in the cause of establishing the foundation for national construction, and to connect this policy with their own lives and work. Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper also reflected such examples in its reports: at the completion of the three major projects, some construction workers were reluctant to hand over the projects to the production departments, and some were unwilling to engage in the construction of new projects again, but were willing to stay in the factory for production. On the one hand, the enthusiasm of these workers to participate in the production of the country's newly built factories is valuable, but on the other hand, it shows that they have not yet seen the important significance of engaging in key construction and the responsibilities they should bear. This also intensifies the responsibility of our newspapers in this aspect of publicity.

    Another important content of clarifying the significance of the key construction policy is to explain the relationship between these constructions and the whole country, so that people can recognize the correctness of the key construction policy. Precisely because key construction is a matter of concern to the people of the whole country, and is often a focus of national support, newspapers should not focus on a relatively narrow area, only emphasizing guiding practical work and reporting on the business activities of the projects themselves, while neglecting the concern and support of the people of the whole country for them. Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper pointed out in its review that their publicity was in a state of "closed-doorism" for a long time, and did not connect Anshan with the whole country. When large-scale construction began in Anshan in 1952, slogans such as "Everything for supporting Ansteel" and "For Anshan is for the whole country" were put forward everywhere. In the words of the Anshan workers themselves, "Talents come from the east, west, north, and south, and materials are sent from all directions." What a moving and great scene this is! Newspapers should never isolate the relationship between Anshan and the whole country in their reports. Facts have also proved that once Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper changed its state of "closed-doorism," some inspiring reports appeared in the newspaper. For example: when workers of the Shanghai private Zhaofeng Iron Factory manufactured various important parts for Ansteel's No. 7 blast furnace, they carefully checked the quality of the parts, wanting to fulfill their responsibility for the early iron production of the No. 7 blast furnace. The workers said: if the No. 7 blast furnace is delayed by one day, the country will lose tens of billions of yuan in wealth. How can we be worthy of the country if we don't make good parts? Li Wenchun, a loading and unloading worker at the Shenyang Station Supply Cooperative, also wrote to Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper saying: I have transported materials for the three major projects. I am particularly careful when I carry each item, fearing that I will damage it. I always work harder, fearing that moving slowly will delay the country's construction. It is precisely the enthusiastic support actions of the people of the whole country that powerfully inspire the builders of Anshan.

    To publicize the political and economic significance of key construction in the newspapers is to guide people to connect this construction work with their own vital interests and implement the Party's policy into their daily work and life. Therefore, newspapers need to use the power of public opinion to commend units and individuals who implement this policy and fight against phenomena that violate this policy. During the construction of the three major projects, Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper commended units and individuals who attached importance to and did a good job in supporting key construction. Combined with the then ongoing increase production and practice economy movement, it reported on the enthusiastic support carried out by the workers of the Ansteel Machinery General Factory under the slogan of "Completing the task of the three major projects is the greatest increase production and practice economy," as well as the support actions of the workers of the Ansteel Transportation Department, Anshan Municipal State-owned and Joint State-Private Industries, etc. At the same time, the newspaper criticized some units that emphasized difficulties and did not actively and proactively support key construction. The newspaper twice criticized the Mechanical Installation Company Repair Factory for delaying the processing orders for many major basic construction projects for a long time without asking about them, and the fact that the hand-cranked winches urgently needed for the No. 7 blast furnace, which should have been delivered in June, had not been delivered until mid-July. And it specifically explained: the three major projects are a huge machine, and each department and each type of work are large and small gears, which must be proactively coordinated with these projects. If you are a drafting engineer, you should think that because a drawing is not delivered on time, how many workers may be waiting on the site and unable to work; the materialman should think that if a material cannot be supplied on time, the project may be delayed; a foundry worker should think that if he is negligent for a moment and fails to ensure the quality of a part, the project may produce unimaginable consequences. Some criticisms made by Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper on the phenomenon of decentralism that violated the key construction policy not only explained the reasons for supporting key projects, but also linked everyone's daily labor with the work of supporting key projects. At any time, the newspaper must clearly tell people what to do and how to do it. And Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper did not do enough in this regard. As they pointed out in their review, because they did not fully understand the serious significance of the overall thinking in industrial construction, and did not regard decentralism as a social product under the current situation of the dominance of small-scale peasant economy in our country, which should be constantly fought against, they did not seize the main examples in the reports to conduct systematic and profound criticisms, and better mobilize everyone ideologically to work hard to support key construction.

    In addition, newspapers should also deeply publicize and promote the study of the Soviet Union. This is because: "Since the great Soviet government agreed to give systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and reconstruction of 91 new enterprises in China and 50 enterprises that are being constructed and reconstructed, the Chinese people will be able to gradually establish their own strong heavy industry by striving to learn from the advanced experience and latest technological achievements of the Soviet Union..." [Note]. From the construction of the three major projects of Ansteel, people also deeply realized that comprehensively and deeply learning from the Soviet Union and striving to improve their technical skills and management level is a powerful guarantee for the construction of key projects. Therefore, people call these projects the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship. According to the review of Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper, although they regarded the study of the Soviet Union as a regular reporting content, they often only focused on the technical aspects, reporting how the Soviet experts helped solve some key technical problems and how much the project was accelerated. And they neglected to report that during the construction process, Soviet experts helped us establish scientific management institutions and systems, and our learning situation in this regard. Although the former is a very important aspect of publicizing the study of the Soviet Union, the lack of the latter cannot reflect the full picture of learning from the Soviet Union. Related to this is that only the technical personnel and workers' learning from the Soviet Union were reported, while the management cadres, especially the leading cadres' learning from the Soviet Union, was rarely reported; only the technical assistance of Soviet experts to the project was publicized, while their internationalist spirit and advanced working methods were rarely reported. This cannot deepen people's understanding in this regard, thereby improving their enthusiasm for learning from the Soviet Union and leading the learning to a climax. In this way, the newspaper will also be unable to meet the needs of national construction and the people to a certain extent. The people who built Anshan have a deep feeling for the Soviet Union's help and learning from the Soviet Union, but they cannot see a comprehensive reflection of this aspect in the newspaper, so they criticized the newspaper. This call from Anshan readers is worthy of our attention.

    After understanding the content of key construction publicity, one issue that needs attention in reporting methods is that this publicity should be relatively focused, prominent, continuous, and regular. Anshan "Worker's Life" newspaper adopted the method of setting up special columns, such as "People Building the Three Major Projects," "The Whole Country Supports Ansteel, Ansteel Supports the Whole Country," "Thank the Soviet Government, Soviet People, and Soviet Experts for Their Help to the Three Major Projects," etc., which played a certain role in the concentration of reporting. In particular, in the "People Building the Three Major Projects" column, the method of using innovators' self-reports is often used for reporting, which makes it possible for the newspaper to truly become their own platform. However, most of the newspaper's publicity was carried out before and after the completion of the three major projects, and it was not able to timely promote the experiences and achievements of these innovators to the entire construction front, nor did it systematically publicize and promote the typical figures and typical deeds among them, which cannot effectively achieve the purpose of establishing flags and promoting everyone to learn from them. The content of key construction is rich and diverse, there are many meaningful things, and there are many problems that can be reported. We must be good at analyzing and selecting from them, grasping the most important issues and things, and making typical reports on them from the front and side, so that we can better attract people to the center of this construction cause.

    Key construction has increasingly become the center of national construction work. As one of the Party's powerful ideological weapons, newspapers must play their role in promoting this construction work. Comrade Molotov said in the article "The Press and the Current Economic Construction Movement": "Most of our movements are carried out through the press. These movements should also be used to improve our press and to bring the press to a higher stage." Our newspapers, especially newspapers in key construction areas, should strive to learn from construction, summarize the publicity experience in this regard, and deepen the publicity of key construction.

    动员人们积极参加重点建设
    张浅
    当国家建设特别是苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项重大工程在各地逐渐展开的时候，报纸在宣传和贯彻重点建设方针中的责任就日益加重。而处在重点建设地区的报纸，尤其要直接担负起动员和组织广大人民参加和支援重点建设的重大任务。
    　一年多以来，不少报纸都曾注意了这一方面的宣传。有些重点建设地区的报纸，并把它放在首要和中心的地位，作了比较连续而集中的报道。这些报纸在宣传和贯彻重点建设方针，反映重点建设的面貌和问题，以及鼓舞劳动群众参加和支援重点建设方面，起了一定的作用。这些成绩是应该肯定的。但是这一宣传对于我们报纸来说，还是个新的问题，因此在宣传中也就产生了一些缺点，其中最主要的是宣传不够深入。鞍山“工人生活”报最近对重点建设的宣传作了一次检查。这里，特就该报检查中所反映的情况，对如何深入这一宣传的问题，提出一些意见。
    从鞍山“工人生活”报关于鞍山钢铁公司（以下简称鞍钢）大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和七号炼铁炉三大工程的宣传情况看来，要深入宣传重点建设，就必须从思想上教育和动员职工群众积极参加重点建设，提高他们的社会主义觉悟和发扬他们的首创精神，并从而鼓舞广大职工的建设热情。在鞍山三大工程的建设队伍中，可以见到许多不久以前还是手拿锄头的农民，今天已经成了掌握技术的建设者。他们在改变建设面貌的同时，也改造着自己。例如，在去年的一期鞍山“工人生活”报上，报道了鞍钢金属结构工程公司女电焊工李桂兰不顾困难，学习技术的事迹。李桂兰当时才十七岁，一年前还是一个什么技术也不会的农村姑娘，而现在已成为一名很熟练的女电焊工人。报纸也报道了三大工程的建设者的忘我的劳动精神。其中有在建设无缝钢管厂当中，带头下到冰水里挖泥土的王进忠；有为了挽救柱角坑壁的坍塌，不顾生命危险，下到漫腰深的水里，保证了“托柱换基”工程胜利的王洪发等人。他们在重点建设中的这种忘我的劳动，为职工群众作出了一个榜样。但是报纸上反映的这样比较生动感人的事例为数还不很多。不少报道只注意反映建设中的业务活动和工程的成就与壮大，而忽视了从思想上启发工人群众的社会主义觉悟，发扬他们的首创精神。
    为了使重点建设的宣传，能成为推动人们更好地参加或者支援这些建设工作的巨大力量，还必须在报道中教育人们认识发展重点建设的政治意义和经济意义。根据鞍山“工人生活”报的检查，他们在进行三大工程的宣传时，曾发生过只偏重于从技术方面来宣传重点工程的优越性，而忽视宣传它们的政治经济意义的偏向。例如他们在不少的关于三大工程的报道中，都着重宣传了这些工厂设备的机械化和自动化，以及它们优越的劳动条件将给从事生产的工人带来多少好处，却很少注意从根本上阐明这些工程的建设对实现国家的社会主义工业化、对改造农业、手工业以及对改善人民生活的关系。有时虽说到了，但又说得不全面。当然，宣传这些工厂的新式的技术设备和优越的劳动条件，也是很必要的；但是忽视了后者，就将这些工厂的优越和先进说成只是与一部分人有关的事情，而不是在人民政治经济生活中有重大意义的事情。其结果就难以具体地通过重点建设的宣传，用事实教育人们领会必须首先发展重工业和贯彻重点建设的方针，并且让参加建设的人们，从思想上认识到自己是在从事于为国家建设树立根基的事业，把这个方针和自己的生活、工作联系起来。鞍山“工人生活”报在报道中也反映了这样的例子：在三大工程竣工时，有的建设工人舍不得将工程移交给生产部门，有的则不愿再从事新的工程的建设工作，愿意留在厂子里生产。从一方面说，这些工人要求参加国家新建工厂生产的热情是可贵的，但另一方面则说明，他们还没有看清从事重点建设的重要意义和自己应负的责任。这里也就加重了我们报纸在这一方面宣传的责任。
    阐明重点建设方针意义的另一个重要内容，就是说明这些建设和全国的关系，让人们认清重点建设方针的正确性。正因为重点建设是全国人民所注目的事情，也常常是全国支援的一个重心，报纸就不应该把目光放在比较狭窄的地方，只强调指导实际工作，去报道工程本身的业务活动，而忽略了全国人民对它们的关心和支援。鞍山“工人生活”报在检查中曾指出说，他们的这一宣传在很长一个时期是处在“闭关自守”状态，没有把鞍山和全国联系起来。在一九五二年鞍山大规模建设开始的时候，各地就提出了“一切为了支援鞍钢”、“为鞍山就是为全国”的行动口号。用鞍山工人自己的话来形容，就是“东西南北来人材，四面八方送物资”。这是一幅多么动人的伟大场面！报纸在报道中决不应该把鞍山和全国的关系隔离起来。事实也证明，鞍山“工人生活”报一旦改变了它的“闭关自守”的状态，报纸上就出现了一些鼓舞人心的报道。例如：上海私营兆丰铁工厂工人为鞍钢七号炼铁炉制造各种重要配件时，仔细检查着配件的质量，要为七号高炉提前出铁尽到责任。工人说：七号高炉如果迟一天开工，就要使国家损失十几亿元财富。我们不造好配件怎么对得起国家呢？沈阳站供应社装卸工人李文纯也给鞍山“工人生活”报写信说：我搬运过三大工程的材料，我在搬每件东西时都特别小心，恐怕弄坏了。我总是加劲地干，怕搬慢了耽误国家的建设。正是全国人民的这种热情支援的行动，有力地鼓舞着鞍山的建设者。
    在报纸上宣传重点建设的政治意义和经济意义，就是要引导人们把这一建设工作和自己的切身利益联系起来，把党的方针贯彻到日常工作和生活中去。因此，报纸就需要运用舆论的力量，表扬贯彻执行这一方针的单位和个人，并与违反这一方针的现象进行斗争。鞍山“工人生活”报在三大工程建设期间，表扬了重视和作好支援重点建设的单位与个人。并结合当时开展的增产节约运动，报道了鞍钢机械总厂职工在“完成三大工程任务就是最大的增产节约”口号下所进行的热烈支援，以及鞍钢运输部、鞍山市地方国营、公私合营工业的职工等的支援行动。同时，报纸又对一些强调困难，不积极主动去支援重点建设的单位进行了批评。报纸两次批评机械安装公司修配厂把许多基本建设主要工程的加工订货压了很长时间而不过问，六月份应交出的七号炼铁炉急需的手摇卷扬机，直到七月中旬还未交货的事实。并具体说明：三大工程是一部巨大的机器，各部门、各工种就是大大小小的齿轮，都必须面向这些工程主动地进行配合。你是制图的工程师，就应该想到由于一张图纸未能按时交出，就可能有多少工人在现场等着不能工作；材料员应该想到一种材料没能按时供应，就可能使工程延期；一个翻砂工人应该想到，如一时疏忽未能保证一个零件的质量，就可能使工程产生不可想像的恶果。鞍山“工人生活”报对违反重点建设方针的分散主义现象所进行的某些批判，不仅说明了支援重点工程的道理，并把每个人的日常劳动和对重点工程的支援工作相联系起来。报纸在任何时候，都必须明确地告诉人们作什么和怎样作的问题。而鞍山“工人生活”报在这一点上是作得不够的。正如他们在检查中所指出的，由于他们对整体思想在工业建设中的严重意义认识不足，没有把分散主义看成是我国目前小农经济占优势的情况下的一种社会性的产物，应该经常与之进行斗争，因而在报道中没有抓住主要的事例进行系统深刻的批判，更好地从思想上把大家动员起来，为支援重点建设而努力。
    另外，报纸还应该深入地宣传和推动对苏联的学习。这是因为：“由于伟大的苏联政府同意在建设和改建中国的九十一个新的企业以及正在建设和改建的五十个企业中给以系统的经济的和技术的援助，中国人民将能够在学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术成就的努力之下，逐步地建立起自己的强大的重工业，……”〔注〕。从鞍钢三大工程的建设中，人们也深深体会到全面地深入地向苏联学习，努力提高自己的技术本领和管理水平，是建设重点工程的有力保证，因而人们把这些工程叫做中苏友谊的结晶。根据鞍山“工人生活”报的检查，他们虽然把学习苏联的问题作为经常的报道内容，但常常只偏重于技术方面，报道由于苏联专家帮助解决了技术上的什么关键问题，工程加快了多少多少。而忽略了报道在建设过程中苏联专家帮助我们建立了科学的管理机构和制度，以及我们在这一方面的学习情况。虽然前者是宣传学习苏联很重要的一面，但缺少了后者，就不能反映学习苏联的全貌。与此相联系的则是，只报道了技术人员、工人学习苏联的情况，而对管理干部特别是领导干部学习苏联的情况则很少报道；只宣传了苏联专家对工程的技术上的帮助，而对他们的国际主义精神和先进的工作方法也很少报道。这就不能加深人们在这一方面的认识，从而提高他们学习苏联的热情，把学习引向高潮。这样，报纸也就会在一定程度上不能满足国家建设和人民群众的需要。建设鞍山的人们，对苏联的帮助和学习苏联是感受很深的，但是他们不能从报纸上见到这一方面的全面反映，因而向报纸提出了批评。鞍山读者的这个呼声，是值得我们重视的。
    了解了重点建设宣传的内容后，在报道方法上需要注意的一个问题，就是应使这一宣传作到比较集中突出和连续经常。鞍山“工人生活”报采取了辟设专栏的方法，如辟了“建设三大工程的人们”、“全国支援鞍钢、鞍钢支援全国”、“感谢苏联政府、苏联人民、苏联专家对三大工程的帮助”等专栏，这在报道的集中方面，起了一定的效果。特别是“建设三大工程的人们”专栏中，经常运用革新者自述的方式来进行报道，这就有可能使报纸真正成为他们自己的讲台。但是该报的这一宣传，大多是在三大工程竣工前后进行的，没有能够将这些革新者的经验和成就及时地推广到整个建设战线上去，也没有对其中的典型人物和典型事迹进行系统的宣传和推广，这就不能有效地达到树立旗帜、推动大家来向他们学习的目的。重点建设的内容是丰富而多样的，有意义的事多，可报道的问题也多。我们必须善于从中进行分析和选择，抓住最主要的问题和事物，从正面、侧面对它们作典型的报道，这样才能更好地把人们吸引到这个建设事业的中心。
    重点建设已日益成为国家建设工作的中心。作为党的强有力的思想武器之一的报纸，必须发挥它在推动这一建设工作中的作用。莫洛托夫同志在“报刊和当前的经济建设运动”一文中说：“我们的一切运动大部分是通过报刊进行的。这些运动也应该用来改进我们报刊，用来把报刊提到高级阶段。”我们的报纸特别是在重点建设地区的报纸，应该努力从建设中学习，总结这一方面的宣传经验，把重点建设的宣传深入一步。
