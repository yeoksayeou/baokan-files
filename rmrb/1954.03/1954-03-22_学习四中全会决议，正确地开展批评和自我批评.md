The Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to promoting intra-party democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The general program and many articles of the Party Constitution contain very specific provisions on this issue. In the work and life of the Party, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often warned us not to be satisfied with existing achievements, but to firmly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and constantly overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes. Only in this way can the cause of our Party develop victoriously. The vast majority of Party cadres can follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and work with modesty and prudence. Therefore, the cause of our Party, especially the cause of our Party since the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, has been able to advance from one victory to another despite many difficulties. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, held in February this year, summarized the work of the past three and a half years from the Third Plenary Session of the Party in June 1950 to the present. While pointing out the great achievements made by the Party's work in all aspects, it also pointed out the shortcomings and errors existing in the Party's work in various aspects, and believed that: "Timely discovery and correction of shortcomings and errors in work is one of the fundamental reasons for the great achievements of our work. Therefore, it is required that the entire Party always maintain a humble attitude and a spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and strive to continuously correct and overcome shortcomings and errors in work." (Communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee) This shows that the attitude of our Party's cadres towards work basically conforms to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong in the past, and promotes the spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

However, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party also pointed out: "After the victory of the new democratic revolution in China, a very dangerous sense of pride is growing in some cadres within the Party. They are overwhelmed by certain achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and self-criticism spirit that Communist Party members must possess, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing personal prestige, considering themselves the best in the world, only willing to listen to flattery and praise, unable to accept criticism and supervision, suppressing and retaliating against critics, and even regarding the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms." (Communique of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee) Although this emotion is only growing in some cadres, it is extremely dangerous; especially when this emotion occurs in some senior cadres, it is even more serious. Not only because the existence of this emotion will hinder the victorious advance of the people's revolutionary cause, but also because the development of this emotion can lead to the development of individualism, can lead to damage and destruction to the unity of the Party, and can lead to serious losses to the Party's cause.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught us at the Seventh National Congress of the Party: "The people, only the people, are the driving force in creating world history." We should know that no matter what achievements we have made, and no matter what work we are currently undertaking, if we leave the leadership of the Party and the concerted efforts of the people, nothing can be accomplished. If we have made some achievements under the leadership of the Party and together with the people, and think that we are great, want to steal the achievements of the people as our own, and are unwilling to stand among the people, but want to stand above the people, and only willing to listen to flattery and praise, and unable to accept criticism and supervision, this is the despicable individualistic viewpoint of the bourgeoisie, which is fundamentally incompatible with the noble qualities of a Communist Party member who wholeheartedly and diligently serves the people. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly sounded the alarm to the entire Party regarding this proud sentiment, especially on the eve of our victory in the national revolution, and solemnly pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party: "Due to victory, the proud sentiment in the Party, the sentiment of considering oneself a meritorious official, the sentiment of stagnation and unwillingness to make progress, and the sentiment of seeking pleasure and unwillingness to live a hard life may grow." However, some cadres in our Party turned a deaf ear to this warning and did not guard against it. Can this be said to be only because they do not understand the Party's instructions? It cannot be said that way. For Party members and cadres across the country, strengthening Marxist-Leninist education and education on the Party Program and Party Constitution for Party members is important and necessary, and this education is indeed one of the most effective methods for overcoming individualistic thinking and establishing a communist worldview. However, experience tells us that this education alone is not enough. The work and life of every cadre must also be supervised by the entire Party and the people. That is to say, every cadre should promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and regularly accept criticism from the Party and the people. Only then will his character, talents, and work develop healthily. Comrade Malenkov said at the 19th Congress of the CPSU: "Experience proves that even excellent workers, if they are left unattended and their work is not supervised and inspected, they will become corrupt and bureaucratized." At a time when the entire Party is striving to realize the general line and general task of the transition period, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party timely proposed to the entire Party, especially to the Party's senior cadres, to strengthen Party unity, develop intra-party democracy, and develop criticism and self-criticism, which is very necessary and very wise.

Not welcoming criticism, and unwilling to face up to the shortcomings and errors in one's own work is what all our enemies hope for. Whoever welcomes compliments, whoever welcomes unprincipled praise and boasting, all our enemies will try their best to use this weakness to gradually satisfy his desires and achieve the purpose of undermining the Party and the revolution. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee tells us: China is now in the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. This is what the imperialists and all the counter-revolutionary remnants in the country do not like. They will inevitably look for and use all opportunities to carry out sabotage. Our shortcomings and errors, and the proud emotions of our cadres, are exactly what they want to find and use. If some of our cadres insist on shortcomings and errors, or indulge their proud emotions, and regard the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms, and even develop to the point of undermining the unity of the Party, our enemies will applaud even more, because in this way, the enemy has already found practical agents within our Party to undermine the unity of our Party. Of course, all loyal cadres will never want themselves to have such a development. Comrades who have accidentally made such mistakes can also repent once someone warns them. Therefore, Party cadres across the board must always be vigilant about their own shortcomings, errors, and proud emotions, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and immediately eliminate them when they begin to sprout. If we find that other comrades have shortcomings, errors, and proud emotions, we should never ignore them, but must promptly expose and overcome them, even at the germination stage, we should prevent problems before they occur and not allow them to grow and spread. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Party Spirit" on July 1, 1941, was issued to oppose tendencies against Party spirit such as "individualism," "unorganized state," "independentism," and "anti-centralized decentralism." It stipulates that it is necessary to "discover and correct immediately, and not condone the continued development of errors, in order to save cadres and prevent work from suffering losses. Oppose being polite to the face and criticizing behind the back. All criticisms should be put forward positively, frankly, and sincerely, with the aim of saving, not of attacking. Emphasis should be placed on unity and mutual assistance within the Party, caring for cadres, and helping cadres in their political progress. However, for those who repeatedly refuse to change after being told, timely prevention must be taken, and disciplinary sanctions must be applied." Revisiting this instruction today is very necessary for us.

In this same decision, it was also emphasized that senior cadres "must participate in branch organizations, live a certain Party organizational life, humbly listen to the criticisms of Party members and the masses about themselves, and enhance their own Party spirit training." In recent years, the vast majority of senior cadres of our Party have complied with this provision and acted accordingly; however, there are also a few comrades who have not done so, and some senior cadres have even adopted covert or overt means of suppressing and retaliating against bottom-up criticism, which is very wrong. The cadres of our Party at all levels serve the people wholeheartedly and with full enthusiasm. In order to ensure that they make fewer mistakes in their work and to constantly improve the political quality of their Communist Party members, humbly listening to the criticism of the people is one of the best methods. However, individual senior cadres within the Party have fallen from the noble qualities of serving the people wholeheartedly and diligently to the despicable individualism of the bourgeoisie because they refused to implement this provision, which should be taken as a warning. Some comrades also advocate criticism and self-criticism in words, but in reality, they do not provide the necessary conditions for carrying out criticism, but stifle criticism. For example, not carefully and patiently listening to the speaker's statement, often using the individual shortcomings of the critic in the content and wording of the criticism to ridicule or refute it; not sincerely accepting and resolutely implementing correct criticisms, or not adopting an attitude of warm welcome and resolute support for criticism, but adopting a perfunctory, passive resistance attitude. These are all impossible to actually develop criticism and self-criticism. Comrade Malenkov said:
"Every leader, especially Party workers, has a responsibility to create conditions so that all honest Soviet people can boldly and fearlessly criticize the shortcomings in the work of our organizations and institutions." If we are loyal Communist Party members who truly promote criticism and self-criticism rather than just doing so verbally, we must do this in order to achieve the results we expect. As for those who adopt covert or overt means of suppressing and retaliating against criticism, they have actually become the kings of "independent kingdoms," they are no longer worthy of the glorious title of Communist Party members, and they will not truly promote criticism and self-criticism. For such people, we should, as Comrade Malenkov said, treat them "as the mortal enemies of the Party and wage a merciless struggle against them." Only in this way can we protect the health of the Party and enable the cause of the Party to advance victoriously.

In our Party life, we must promote democracy; different opinions must be openly raised in meetings and even debated; and criticisms must be made against any cadre's shortcomings and errors in their work in meetings or through organizations. This is one of the important organizational principles of our Party. It is wrong to have different opinions without openly discussing them; it is wrong to discover shortcomings and errors in work without making criticisms; it is also wrong to think that it is not necessary to make criticisms against comrades who usually do good work and have strong principles but have shortcomings or made mistakes. This kind of "it's none of my business, I'll just stand by" mentality and the idea of taking a forgiving attitude towards the mistakes of certain comrades are not communist ideas, but bourgeois liberal ideas, which must be opposed. If there are different opinions on a certain job or criticisms on the shortcomings in a certain job, but they are not discussed at the meeting, but spread outside the meeting, not talked about face-to-face, but talked about randomly behind the back, not raised through the organization, and discussed everywhere, this is also a serious manifestation of liberalism, which is very harmful to the work, does not help comrades in the slightest, and will inevitably damage the unity of the Party. We must be vigilant, resolutely eliminate these abnormal phenomena, and put all different opinions and criticisms on the table. Correctly conducting criticism and self-criticism is a comrade-like mutual help. All comrades who are willing to overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes will welcome this kind of criticism, which can and will certainly enhance the unity of the Party. The unity advocated by our Party is not unprincipled harmony, but unity based on Marxism-Leninism. This kind of unity can only be consolidated by carrying out correct criticism and self-criticism. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us: "Starting from unity, going through criticism or struggle, to achieve the goal of unity." Following this rule, self-criticism within the Party can develop healthily, and the unity of our Party will surely be enhanced.

In conducting criticism and self-criticism, it must be based on facts, and should neither be covered up nor exaggerated. According to the instructions of the Fourth Plenary Session, it is not appropriate to deliberately exaggerate the individual, partial, temporary, and relatively unimportant shortcomings or errors of others into systematic and serious shortcomings or errors, because this attitude does not start from unity, cannot achieve the purpose of unity, and is not conducive to the Party. For those comrades who have shortcomings or errors but are willing to correct and implement corrections after being criticized and educated, the policy of treating illnesses to save people should be adopted; but for those who confront the Party, insist on not correcting errors, and even engage in sectarian activities and splitting activities within the Party, the Party must conduct a merciless struggle against them, give them strict sanctions, and even expel them from the Party when necessary. These instructions are completely correct, which can both avoid the development of shortcomings and errors and enhance the unity of the Party.

The dangerous tendency mentioned above of pride and complacency, suppressing criticism, and even developing into an "independent kingdom" is something that all Party comrades must be vigilant against and oppose. Senior Party leaders have a greater responsibility, and the Fourth Plenary Session pointed this out, which is completely necessary. However, if you think that this is only a matter for senior cadres, and it seems to have nothing to do with our "ordinary Party members," then that is completely wrong. This is not only because every Party member has the obligation to "struggle against all phenomena that damage the interests of the Party inside and outside the Party" (Article 2 of the Party Constitution), and every Party member has the obligation to resist, expose, and struggle against the above-mentioned dangerous tendencies at any time; but also because the essence of all the above-mentioned dangerous tendencies is the development of bourgeois individualism. This individualistic thinking still exists to a greater or lesser extent in many of our cadres. If we do not consciously overcome it, small individualism can develop into large individualism when it encounters a suitable climate and soil. Our Party is still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean, and the ideological and political situation of some comrades within the Party is still quite complex. The Marxist-Leninist education of the Party is still far from enough, and some less firm members of the Party may still be eroded by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, overcoming individualistic thinking is a long-term ideological struggle process, which requires all Party comrades to carry out continuously and with a high degree of awareness. We should examine whether we have any manifestations of individualism, and overcome it when it is not yet very harmful; only in this way can communist thinking develop healthily in our minds. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all Party comrades to conscientiously study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism.

### 学习四中全会决议，正确地开展批评和自我批评

    学习四中全会决议，正确地开展批评和自我批评
    中国共产党对发扬党内民主、开展批评与自我批评，从来是非常重视的。在党章的总纲和许多条文上，对这个问题都有非常具体的规定。在党的工作和党的生活中，我们党的中央和毛泽东同志，经常告诫我们不要满足于已有的成就，要紧紧掌握批评和自我批评这个武器，不断地克服缺点、纠正错误，只有这样，我们党的事业才能胜利地发展。全党干部，绝大多数都能遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，谦虚谨慎地工作，因此，我们党的事业，特别是中国共产党第七次全国代表大会以来我们党的事业，虽然遇到过许多困难，终于能够一个胜利接着一个胜利地前进。今年二月召开的党的七届四中全会总结了从一九五○年六月党的三中全会到现在三年半的工作，在指出党的工作在各方面获得了巨大的成绩的同时，又指出了党在各项工作中存在着的缺点和错误，并认为：“及时地发现和纠正工作中的缺点和错误，乃是我们各项工作获得巨大成就的根本原因之一，因此要求全党始终保持谦逊态度和批评与自我批评精神，为不断纠正和克服工作中的缺点和错误而奋斗。”（七届四中全会公报）这就说明我们全党的干部对工作的态度，基本上是符合党中央和毛泽东同志历次的指示，发扬了批评和自我批评的精神的。
    但是党的七届四中全会又指出：“在中国新民主主义革命胜利后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。”（七届四中全会公报）这种情绪，虽然只是在一部分干部中滋长着，但是这是极端危险的；特别是这种情绪竟在某些高级干部中发生，就更为严重。不仅因为这种情绪的存在，会阻碍人民革命事业的胜利前进，而且因为这种情绪的发展，可以引导到个人主义的发展，可以引导到党的团结的损害和破坏，可以引导到党的事业的严重损失。
    毛泽东同志在党的七次大会上教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们应该知道，不论我们做出过什么成绩，也不论现在担负着什么工作，如果离开了党的领导，离开了人民群众的一致努力，什么事情也是做不成的。如果我们在党的领导之下，和人民群众一道做出了一点成绩，就以为自己了不起，想偷人民之功以为己功，就不愿站在人民之中，而想站在人民之上，就只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，这就是资产阶级的卑鄙的个人主义的观点，与满腔热诚地勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的共产党员的高贵品质根本不能相容。毛泽东同志对于这种骄傲情绪，屡次对全党敲过警钟，特别是在我们取得全国革命胜利的前夜，在党的七届二中全会上严正地指出过：“由于胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”但是我党有一部分干部对这种警告置若罔闻，不加戒备。这能说只是由于他们不了解党的指示吗？不能这样说。对全国党员和干部来说，加强对党员的马克思列宁主义教育和党纲党章的教育是重要的，必需的，这种教育也的确是克服个人主义思想、建立共产主义人生观最有效的方法之一，但是经验告诉我们，只有这种教育，是不够的。每一个干部的工作和生活，还必须受到全党的监督，受到人民的监督，就是说每一个干部都应该发扬批评和自我批评的精神，经常接受党和人民的批评，他的品质、才能和他的工作才会健康地发展。马林科夫同志在苏共第十九次代表大会上说：“经验证明，即使是优秀的工作者，如果对他们放任不管，对他们的工作不加监督检查，他们也会变坏和官僚主义化的。”我们党的七届四中全会在全党为实现过渡时期的总路线总任务而奋斗的时候，及时向全党特别是向党的高级干部提出增强党的团结，发展党内民主，发展批评和自我批评，是非常必要的和非常英明的。
    不欢迎批评，不愿意正视自己工作中的缺点和错误，这是我们的一切敌人所希望的。谁欢迎恭维，谁欢迎人家无原则的捧场和吹嘘，我们的一切敌人就会想方设法利用这一弱点来逐渐满足他的欲望，达到破坏党和革命的目的。七届四中全会告诉我们：现在中国正处在社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段，这是帝国主义者和国内的一切反革命残余所不喜欢的，他们必然要寻找和利用一切机会来进行破坏。我们的缺点和错误，我们干部的骄傲情绪，正是他们所要寻找和利用的东西。如果我们某些干部坚持缺点和错误，或者放任了自己的骄傲情绪，把自己所领导的地区和部门看做是个人的资本和独立王国，甚至发展到破坏党的团结的地步，我们的敌人就会更加拍手欢迎，因为这样一来，敌人就已经在我们党内找到了破坏我党团结的实际代理人。当然，一切忠诚的干部，绝不会愿意自己有这样的发展的。偶然犯了这种错误的同志，一经有人向他提出警告，也是可以悔改的。所以全党的干部对于自己的缺点、错误和骄傲情绪，必须随时提高警惕，经常开展批评和自我批评，在它开始萌芽的时候就应立即消灭它。如果发现别的同志有缺点、错误和骄傲情绪，决不应置之不理，必须及时地加以揭露和克服，那怕是在萌芽的时候，也应该防微杜渐，不使滋长和蔓延。一九四一年七月一日“中共中央关于增强党性的决定”就是为着反对“个人主义”“无组织状态”“独立主义”与“反集中的分散主义”等违反党性的倾向而发布的。它规定了要“即时发现，即时纠正，不纵容错误继续发展，才能挽救干部，和不使工作受到损失。反对当面客气，背后指斥，一切批评应当是正面坦白诚恳的提出，目的是为了挽救，而不是为了打击。应当强调党内的团结互助，爱护干部，帮助干部在政治上的进步。但对于屡说不改者，必须及时预防，加以纪律制裁。”温习这一段指示，今天对于我们是很必要的。
    在这同一个决定内，又强调地提出了高级干部“都必须参加支部组织，过一定的党的组织生活，虚心听取党员群众对于自己的批评，增强自己党性的锻练。”这些年来，我党的绝大多数高级干部都遵守了这一规定，并照着这样去做了的；但是也有少数同志没有这样做，甚至有的高级干部对自下而上的批评还采取了隐蔽的或者公开的压制和报复的手段，这是十分错误的。我党的各级干部抱着满腔热忱全心全意地为人民服务，为着保证在工作中少犯错误，为着不断地提高自己的共产党员的政治品质，虚心听取人民群众的批评正是一个最好的方法，然而党内竟有个别的高级干部由于拒绝执行这一条规定而使自己由满腔热忱地勤勤恳恳地为人民服务的高贵品质，堕落到资产阶级的卑鄙的个人主义方面去，是应当引以为鉴戒的。有些同志口头上也提倡批评和自我批评，但是他在实际上并不给开展批评以应有的条件，而是扼杀了批评。比如，不细心地不耐心地听完批评者的发言，常常利用批评者在批评内容上和词句上的个别缺点而给以嘲笑或批驳；对正确的批评意见不诚恳接受和坚决实行，或者对批评不是采取热烈欢迎与坚决拥护的态度，而是采取敷衍应付、消极抵抗的态度。这些都是不可能实际发展批评和自我批评的。马林科夫同志说：
  “每个领导者，特别是党的工作者，都有责任造成条件，使一切正直的苏联人都能大胆无畏地批评我们的组织与机关工作中的缺点。”如果我们不是口头上而是真正提倡批评和自我批评的忠诚的共产党员，我们就必须这样做，才能收到我们所预期的结果。至于那些对批评采取隐蔽的或者公开的压制和报复手段的人，他们实际上成了“独立王国”的国王，他们已经与共产党员的光荣称号不相称了，他们是不会真正提倡批评和自我批评的。对于这种人，我们应该像马林科夫同志所说的，把他们“当作党的死敌，与之进行无情的斗争。”只有这样，才能保护党的健康，才能使党的事业得以胜利地前进。
    我们在党的生活中，必须发扬民主；有不同的意见必须在会议上公开提出以至展开争论；对任何干部在工作中的缺点和错误，也必须在会议上或经过组织提出批评，这是我们党的重要组织原则之一。有不同的意见而不公开提出讨论，是不对的；发现了工作中的缺点和错误而不提出批评，是不对的；对那种平时工作不错、原则性也较强的同志有了缺点或犯了错误，认为不必提出批评，也是错误的。这种“事不关己、高高挂起”的思想以及对某些同志的错误采取原谅态度的思想，不是共产主义的思想，而是资产阶级的自由主义的思想，必须反对。如果对某项工作有不同的意见或对某项工作中的缺点有批评，不提到会议上讨论，而在会外散播，当面不谈，背后乱谈，不经过组织提出，到处议论，这也是一种严重的自由主义的表现，对工作有很大害处，对同志没有丝毫帮助，而且必然要损害党的团结。我们必须警惕，坚决消灭这些不正常的现象，把所有不同的意见和批评都摆到桌面上来。正确地进行批评和自我批评，这是一种同志式的互相帮助，凡是愿意克服缺点改正错误的同志，都将欢迎这种批评，这是可以和一定会增进党的团结的。我党所提倡的团结，不是无原则的一团和气，而是在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，这种团结只有进行正确的批评和自我批评才能巩固。党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们：“从团结出发，经过批评或斗争，达到团结的目的。”按着这条规则去做，党内的自我批评就可以健康地发展，我党的团结就一定会增进。
    进行批评和自我批评，必须实事求是，既不应该包庇，也不应该夸大。根据四中全会的指示，不应当故意把别人的个别的、局部的、暂时的、比较不重要的缺点或错误夸大为系统的、严重的缺点或错误，因为这种态度就不是从团结出发，就不能达到团结的目的，就不利于党。对于那种具有缺点或错误但在受到批评教育以后愿意改正并实行改正的同志，应当采取治病救人的方针；但是对于那种与党对抗、坚持不改正错误的，甚至在党内进行宗派活动、分裂活动的分子，党就必须进行无情的斗争，给以严格的制裁，直至在必要时将他们驱逐出党。这些指示是完全正确的，既可以避免缺点和错误的发展，又可以增进党的团结。
    上面所说到的骄傲自满、压制批评、甚至发展为“独立王国”的危险倾向，是全党同志必须警惕和反对的，特别是党的高级负责干部有更重大的责任，四中全会这样指出，是完全必要的。但是如果以为这只是高级干部的事，与我们“普通党员”似乎没有什么关系，那就完全不对了。这不但是因为每一个党员都有义务“和党内党外一切损害党的利益的现象进行斗争”（党章第二条），对于上述这些危险倾向，每一个党员都有义务随时抵制、揭露和进行斗争；而且是因为所有上述这些危险倾向的本质，都是资产阶级的个人主义思想的发展，这种个人主义的思想在我们很多干部中还或多或少地存在着，如果不自觉地进行克服，小个人主义遇到适宜的气候和土壤是可以发展为大个人主义的。我党现在还采取着和资产阶级联合的政策，小资产阶级还像汪洋大海似地包围着我们，加以党内一部分同志的思想政治情况还相当复杂，党的马克思列宁主义教育还很不够，党内的某些不甚坚定的分子还可能受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀，所以克服个人主义思想，是一个长期的思想斗争过程，是需要全党同志都以高度的自觉来长期不断地进行的。我们应该检查我们自己有无个人主义的表现，要当它还为害不大的时候就把它克服；只有这样，共产主义的思想才能在我们的头脑中健全地发展起来。因此，认真学习四中全会的文件，正确地开展批评和自我批评，是全党同志应有的责任。
