To eliminate hidden dangers in Weizhou dykes, Jiangxi Province has vigorously carried out cone penetration testing. From September 1952 to the end of January this year, the cone penetration length reached more than 59,900 meters, with 156,900 cone holes, discovering more than 850 large and small cavities. Among them, major hidden dangers, such as the leakage behind Zhangcun Village, Ligang, Taiping Weizhou in Linchuan County, wasted more than 3,600 man-days, 800 straw ropes, and 90 sleeping mats during the 1952 flood season just to protect the dyke for four days and nights; however, after cone penetration revealed the leakage, the leakage accident was completely eliminated by simply spending more than 100 man-days digging and filling. The Nanchang County cone penetration team probed a dike-crossing cave 2.7 meters wide and 1.4 meters high in front of Yujia Village in the county's sixth district. The Fudayou Weizhou Dyke in Nanchang City revealed a well that was hidden under the dike in the Ye Jialou section. The discovery and timely excavation and filling of these many huge hidden dangers have played a significant role in consolidating dykes and ensuring production in the future.

    消灭圩堤隐患，保障生产安全
    江西省大力进行圩堤锥探工作
    为消灭圩堤隐患，江西省大力进行了圩堤锥探工作。自一九五二年九月起至今年一月底止，锥探长度有五万九千九百多公尺，锥眼十五万六千九百个，发现大小洞穴八百五十多处。其中大的隐患，如临川县太平圩里港章村背后的漏洞，在一九五二年防汛时，仅因护堤四昼夜就浪费人工三千六百多个，草绳八百根，晒簟九十床；但经锥探出漏洞后，仅费去一百多人工的挖填，就彻底消灭了该处的漏水事故。南昌县锥探队在该县第六区喻家村前探出一个宽二点七公尺，高一点四公尺的过堤洞。南昌市的富大有圩堤，在叶家楼段探出了一个水井被隐埋在堤下。这许多巨大隐患的发现和及时挖填，对今后巩固堤防，保障生产，起了很大的作用。
