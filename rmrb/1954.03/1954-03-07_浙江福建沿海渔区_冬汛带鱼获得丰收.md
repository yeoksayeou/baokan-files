Zhejiang and Fujian Coastal Fishing Areas Achieve Bumper Harvest of Ribbonfish in Winter Season

The winter ribbonfish season along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian has yielded a bumper harvest. According to incomplete statistics from four major fishing areas in Fujian (Dongshan Island, Pingtan Island, coastal Hui'an County, and Sansha Town fishing port in Xiapu County) and four special districts in Zhejiang (Zhoushan, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Wenzhou), the total fish production reached over 66 million jin, greatly exceeding the output of the same period last year. In Zhejiang's coastal areas, although abnormal weather conditions reduced operation time by one-third during the winter season, the total output still increased by 70% compared to last year, and the unit output also increased by 28.3% compared to last year. The average income per fisherman participating in the winter harvest last year was over 1.45 million yuan, while this year it averaged over 1.99 million yuan, an increase of 37.2% compared to the winter harvest last year.

The fundamental key to the bumper harvest of ribbonfish in the winter season is primarily the emphasis placed on the leadership of this work by the local Communist Party committees. The Zhejiang coastal Party committees have conscientiously studied the provincial Party committee's instructions on fishery work and implemented the spirit of the instructions through various meetings, mobilizing cadres and the masses to do a good job in the winter ribbonfish production. More than 500 cadres from the four special districts of Zhoushan directly participated in the leadership of the winter harvest production. This year's winter season was characterized by extremely abnormal weather, with strong winds and waves, and warmer temperatures, leading to dispersed fish schools and wide, unconcentrated fishing grounds. In response to these characteristics, various localities promptly convened meetings to exchange experiences and put forward the slogan of "go out to sea early, return to port late, cast nets diligently, and catch more fish." At the same time, they focused on experimenting with improved operation methods, giving full play to the potential of people and boats. Secondly, increasing the number of boats, nets, and production units, and doing a good job in integrating production and sales, also ensured increased output and increased the actual income of fishermen. In Zhejiang Province alone, more than 2,000 new boats were put into winter harvest production. Last year, more than 3,500 units from the four special districts of Zhoushan went to the Shengsi Islands to catch ribbonfish, while this year there were more than 4,000 production units. During this year's fishing season, a total of more than 700 public and private ice-fresh transport and sales boats were prepared, with a one-time capacity of 250,000 dan of fish. The sale of fish has begun to be carried out in a planned and controlled manner, and Zhoushan area has also launched consignment transportation and sales, reducing the blindness of fishermen's self-production and self-sales, increasing production time, and maintaining reasonable prices. This year, the price of fish at the place of origin has generally increased by more than 30% compared to last year, increasing the income of fishermen. In addition, after publicizing the general line, various localities have consolidated and expanded mutual aid and cooperative organizations, which also facilitated the improvement of operating techniques, reduced the encroachment of natural disasters, and ensured increased production.

    浙江福建沿海渔区
    冬汛带鱼获得丰收
    浙江、福建沿海冬季带鱼汛生产获得丰收。据福建的东山岛、平潭岛、惠安县沿海、霞浦县三沙镇渔港等四个主要渔区和浙江的舟山、台州、宁波、温州四个专区的不完全统计，共产鱼六千六百多万斤，大大超过去年同期产量。浙江沿海在冬汛期间，虽因气候不正常，使作业时间减少了三分之一，但总产量仍比去年增加了百分之七十，单位产量也比去年增加了百分之二十八点三。去年冬汛参加捕捞的渔民每人平均收入为一百四十五万多元，今年平均一百九十九万多元，比去年冬汛中增加百分之三十七点二。
    冬汛带鱼获得丰收的基本关键，首先是各地中共党委重视对这一工作的领导。浙江沿海党委都认真地研究了省委对渔区工作的指示，并通过各种会议贯彻指示精神，发动干部和群众做好冬汛带鱼生产工作，舟山等四个专区并有五百多个干部直接参加冬汛生产的领导。今年冬汛中气候极不正常，风多浪大，天气较暖，鱼群分散，渔场广阔不集中。各地根据这些特点，及时召开会议，交流经验，提出早出海、晚归港、勤下网、多捕鱼的口号。同时重点试行改进作业方法，发挥了人船潜在力。其次，是增加船网和生产单位，做好了产销结合，也保证了增加产量和增加渔民的实际收入。仅浙江省投入冬汛生产的新船就有二千多只，去年舟山等四个专区去嵊泗列岛捕带鱼的有三千五百多个单位，今年有四千多个生产单位。今年汛期中公私冰鲜运销船共准备了七百多只，一次能容鱼二十五万担。鱼货开始做到了有计划有控制的推销，舟山地区并开展代运代销，减少渔民自产自销的盲目性，增加了生产时间，并保持了合理价格。今年产地鱼价一般都比去年提高了百分之三十多，使渔民增加了收入。此外，各地在宣传总路线以后，巩固、扩大了互助合作组织，也便于提高作业技术，减少自然灾害的侵袭，保证了产量的增加。　（翟作标）
