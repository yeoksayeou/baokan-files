    to Support Daye Steel Plant Expansion Project
    Under the leadership of the Huangshi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Huangshi Municipal People's Government, the Labor Bureau of the Huangshi Municipal People's Government, Hubei Province, is actively transferring manpower to support the expansion project of the Daye Steel Plant.

At the same time, it will assist the basic construction departments of various factories and mines in the city to adjust workers, and assist the basic construction departments in training technical workers to improve their technical level; organize newly transferred workers to study the general line of the state during the transition period and labor discipline to raise their patriotic awareness.

    湖北黄石市积极调拨人力
    支援大冶钢厂扩建工程
    湖北黄石市人民政府劳动局在中共黄石市委、市人民政府领导下，正积极调拨人力，支援大冶钢厂的扩建工程。
    国营华中钢铁公司大冶钢厂，今年开始了大规模的扩建工程，除了技术工人由中央和中南直接调拨外，还需要大批普通工人。黄石市政府劳动局一面派出干部与黄冈专署取得联系，准备从该专区所辖浠水、鄂城、大冶、广济等县抽调大批民工，并继续与有关县签订合同，保证供应足够的劳动力。一面协助本市各厂矿基本建设部门调剂工人，并协助各基本建设部门训练技术工人，提高他们的技术水平；组织新调来的工人学习国家过渡时期总路线和劳动纪律，提高他们的爱国主义觉悟。（大垦）
