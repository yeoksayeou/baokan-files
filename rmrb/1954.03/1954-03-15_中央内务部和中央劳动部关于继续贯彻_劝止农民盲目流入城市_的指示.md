Instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Labor Regarding Continuing to Implement "Persuading Peasants to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities"

    Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Persuading Peasants to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities" in April last year, the chaotic phenomenon of peasants blindly flowing into cities at that time has been reversed. However, some regions have not conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Government Administration Council. On the one hand, our publicity work has not been sufficient, so that some peasants cannot well understand the spirit of the instructions; on the other hand, some county, district, and township cadres do not conscientiously implement the instructions and still irresponsibly issue letters of introduction indiscriminately. At the same time, some employers privately recruit workers in rural areas without going through the prescribed procedures. In addition, some areas suffered from natural disasters last year. Because self-reliance through production was not emphasized or relief work was not timely, the phenomenon of peasants blindly flowing into cities continues to occur, and in some areas it is even becoming more serious.

    Now that the Spring Festival has passed, it is the season when "peasants flow into cities" is customary. If we do not try to dissuade them as soon as possible, a large number of peasants will inevitably flow blindly again, which will affect spring plowing and sowing, and will also cause chaos in urban social order. For this reason, the following instructions are hereby given:

    (1) All localities should immediately combine the deployment of spring plowing work and adopt various methods to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation of the Government Administration Council's instructions on persuading peasants to stop blindly flowing into cities, explaining that urban construction is still in its initial stage and does not require many people, and that construction workers are already in oversupply. Blindly entering the city will not only waste travel expenses and be in vain, but also delay production. If urban construction needs to increase workers, the district and township governments will be officially notified to conduct planned and organized recruitment. Peasants who enter the city freely without going through the above organizational procedures will definitely not be able to find work. At the same time, in connection with the spirit of the national general line, we should publicize to the peasants the prospects for the development of the agricultural economy, explain the important significance of agricultural production to national construction, and enhance the peasants' enthusiasm for agricultural production, so that they will actively participate in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. We should strengthen ideological education for village cadres who are not at ease with rural work, so that they can establish a correct view of cherishing agricultural labor and lead the majority of peasants to actively participate in agricultural production.

    (2) All localities must lead peasants to actively engage in agricultural production, think more about ways to increase production, and solve the problem of surplus rural labor through intensive cultivation, improving production technology, consolidating land, improving soil, building water conservancy projects, and planting trees. In the slack farming season, we should also lead peasants to use all locally available conditions to develop various sideline productions with prospects for success. In disaster areas, we should organize disaster victims to carry out self-reliance through production, do a good job in relief work, and effectively solve the difficulties of disaster victims, so that their lives are adequately guaranteed.

    (3) If factories, mines, construction and other employers really need to recruit personnel from rural areas, they must report to the local labor administration department for organized and planned introduction and deployment, and must not recruit workers in rural areas privately. If there are still arbitrary recruitments causing unrest among peasants, the local government should strictly stop them. At the same time, the administration and trade unions of factories, mines, and construction units should earnestly educate their employees not to return to the village or write letters to greet peasants to enter the city. County, district, and township governments must not issue letters of introduction to peasants indiscriminately.

    (4) For peasants who have already flowed into cities, the civil affairs department and the labor department may, in conjunction with other relevant departments, mobilize them to return to their hometowns. The return travel expenses should generally be borne by themselves, but if there are indeed difficulties that cannot be solved by themselves, the local government may grant appropriate subsidies or issue train tickets. If there are indeed difficulties in life and production after returning to their hometowns, the local government should provide appropriate assistance.

### 中央内务部和中央劳动部关于继续贯彻“劝止农民盲目流入城市”的指示

    中央内务部和中央劳动部关于继续贯彻“劝止农民盲目流入城市”的指示
    自去年四月中央人民政府政务院发布“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”后，曾扭转了当时农民盲目流入城市的混乱现象。但有些地区对政务院的指示没有认真贯彻，一方面是我们的宣传工作做的不够，致有些农民对指示的精神不能很好领会；另一方面是某些县、区、乡干部不认真执行指示，仍然不负责任地乱开介绍信。同时还有些用人单位不经过规定手续到农村私自招工，加上去年某些地区遭受灾荒，由于生产自救工作未抓紧或救济工作不及时等，因而农民盲目流入城市的现象仍在继续发生，有些地区甚至日趋严重。
    现在春节已过，正是习惯上“农民流入城市”的季节，如不及早设法劝阻，势必又要发生大批农民的盲目流动，使春耕播种受到影响；同时也会引起城市社会秩序的混乱。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）各地应立即结合布置春耕工作，采取各种方式，将政务院关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示，再向农民进行广泛深入的宣传解释，说明城市建设尚在开始，需人不多，建筑工人已供过于求，如盲目入城，不但浪费路费，徒劳往返，而且还要耽误生产；如果城市建设需要增加工人时，将会正式通知区、乡政府进行有计划有组织的招收。不经过上述组织手续，而自由进城的农民，必无法找到工作。同时还应结合国家总路线精神，向农民宣传农业经济发展的远景，说明农业生产对国家建设的重要意义，提高农民对农业生产的积极性，使其积极的参加农业生产和互助合作运动。对不安心农村工作的村干部，应加强思想教育，使他们树立热爱农业劳动的正确观点，并带动广大农民积极地参加农业生产。
    （二）各地必须领导农民积极从事农业生产，多想增产办法，通过精耕细作、改进生产技术、整修土地、改良土壤、兴修水利、植树造林等项工作，来解决农村的剩余劳动力问题。在农闲季节，并应领导农民利用当地一切可能利用的条件，开展各种有出路的副业生产；在灾区更应组织灾民进行生产自救，作好救济工作，切实解决灾民的困难，使其生活有适当保障。
    （三）各厂、矿、建筑等用人单位如确实需要向农村招用人员时，须报经当地劳动行政部门，进行有组织有计划的介绍和调配，不得私自到农村招收工人。如仍有随意招工而引起农民不安者，当地政府应予以严格制止。同时，各厂、矿、建筑单位的行政和工会，应切实教育所属职工，不得随意回村或写信招呼农民进城。各县、区、乡政府不得给农民乱开介绍信。
      （四）对已经流入城市的农民，可由民政部门、劳动部门会同其他有关部门动员还乡，还乡路费一般应由本人自理，但确有困难不能自行解决者，可由当地政府酌予补助或发给乘车证。外出农民回乡后，在生活、生产上确有困难者，地方政府应予以适当的帮助。
