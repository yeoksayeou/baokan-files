    Organize Cultural and Art Workers to Widely Publicize the General Line
    Examine Literary and Artistic Work Based on the General Line
    In the Central South region, the study of the general line by literary and art circles has entered the stage of examining work based on the general line. Zhao Yimin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central South Bureau, gave an enlightening report on the inspection work in mid-February. 1,500 literary and art workers from Central South, Wuhan, Hubei, and the military listened to the report.
    Zhao Yimin pointed out that the purpose of this inspection work is to deepen the study of the general line, so as to improve ideological level, improve leadership, improve work, and strengthen unity. He particularly pointed out that the central link to be grasped in this inspection work is the issue of creation. To this end, it is necessary to: continue to work hard to go deep into life; improve theoretical and policy thinking; strive to engage in literary and artistic creation practice to improve professional skills and writing ability; vigorously cultivate new literary and artistic cadres; and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only by solving these problems can the resolutions of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers be implemented. In his report, he also gave instructions on how to improve leadership, improve work, and strengthen unity.
    Zhao Yimin called on all Party member literary and art workers to play an active leading role in this inspection work. He also asked all literary and art workers to strive to overcome ideological shortcomings in their work, give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm, and strive to complete their creative plans and create more and better works.
    Northwest Literary and Art Circles Deeply Study the General Line
    On February 26th and 27th, the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles invited Zhao Boping, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee Northwest Bureau, to give a report to the literary and art circles in Xi'an on the general line during the transition period.
    After Zhao Boping explained in detail the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, he gave important instructions on how literary and art workers should serve the general line. He criticized the erroneous idea that the general line is related to financial and economic work and has little relationship with literary and artistic work, and explained that literary and art workers bear a great responsibility for educating the people and raising the people's socialist consciousness during the state's transition period. He pointed out that the literary and artistic work in the Northwest in the past four years has basically moved along the direction of the general line, but compared with the development speed of national construction, the literary and artistic work is relatively backward and cannot keep up with the needs of the people; there are very few heroic model figures among the working people appearing in the works and on the stage, the old traditional bad habits are rarely exposed and criticized in the works, and there are very few works that criticize capitalist ideas that harm socialist and semi-socialist factors, and there are more images of individual farmers, and not enough images of organized farmers, and even fewer works that express advanced workers, so people cannot get greater education and encouragement from literary and artistic works. Regarding historical dramas, Comrade Zhao Boping pointed out that we should reflect more on the historical deeds of peasant uprising leaders and patriotic heroes and other people's struggles in history. Excellent good myths and historical dramas should be retained, because these themes can directly or indirectly educate and encourage the people and serve the general line. Finally, he pointed out that the center of literary and artistic work is creation. In the future, in order to create better and better serve the general line, we must deeply study the general line, understand the essence of the general line, so that we can correctly reflect the party's policies in our works, correctly understand life, and reflect life; we must go deep into the actual struggle life in order to create works with flesh and blood; we must combine the study of the general line and strive to transform ourselves. In addition, we should also improve artistic skills and attach importance to strengthening the unity of the literary and art circles.
    Oppose Formalism and Conceptualization
    In the past two months, literary and art workers in Zhejiang Province have created more than 600 literary and artistic works publicizing the general line, including more than 100 scripts, more than 40 storytelling and singing pieces, more than 50 art works and song creations, and other diverse forms of works. The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has compiled and printed four series of literary and art propaganda materials; some of them have been published as separate editions by the Zhejiang People's Publishing House; and some have been published in the "Zhejiang Literature and Art" monthly magazine. These entertainment programs that promote the general line and general tasks have been universally promoted and performed by local rural theater troupes and amateur theater troupes around the New Year and Spring Festival.
    The harvest in quantity of this literary and artistic creation is not small, but the quality of general works is low, and the adopted manuscripts account for only about 10% of the total number of submissions. The biggest problem with these unadopted manuscripts is still the problem of formalism and conceptualization: the scope of subject matter for general manuscripts is relatively narrow, and the plot arrangements are roughly the same. Except for a story skeleton, the rest are dry sermons, and such works naturally have no power to move people. Secondly, distortions in the portrayal of characters are also found in general works.
    In order to overcome these shortcomings and carry out the creation of publicizing the general line in a deeper step, the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has, through the "Zhejiang Literature and Art" monthly magazine, asked authors to correctly understand life and broaden the scope of their subject matter. In particular, authors are required to go deep into the reality of life, explore subject matter from various aspects of life, avoid monotonous content and boring forms, and create more short, concise, and easy-to-sing and perform works.

    组织文化艺术工作者广泛宣传总路线
    根据总路线检查文艺工作
    中南文学艺术界关于总路线的学习，已开始进入根据总路线检查工作的阶段。中共中央中南局宣传部部长赵毅敏在上月中旬作了检查工作的启发报告。听报告的有中南、武汉、湖北、部队文学艺术工作者一千五百余人。
    赵毅敏指出这次检查工作是为了使总路线学习深入一步，达到提高思想水平、改善领导、改进工作和加强团结的目的。他特别指出：这次检查工作要抓住解决的中心环节是创作问题。为此，必须：继续努力深入生活；提高理论、政策思想水平；努力从事文艺创作实践，提高业务和写作能力；大力培养新的文艺干部；正确地开展批评与自我批评。只有解决这些问题，才能贯彻中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会的决议。他在报告中，对如何改善领导、改进工作、加强团结等问题也作了指示。
    赵毅敏号召全体党员文学艺术工作者，在这次检查工作中要发挥积极带头作用。并要求全体文学艺术工作者努力克服工作中思想上的缺点，发挥积极性与主动性，努力完成自己的创作计划，创作出更多更好的作品来。
    西北文艺界深入学习总路线
    西北文学艺术界联合会于二月二十六、二十七日两天邀请了中共中央西北局宣传部部长赵伯平，向西安市文艺界作有关过渡时期总路线的报告。
    赵伯平在详细讲解了国家在过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务后，就文艺工作者应如何为总路线服务作了重要指示。他批判了那种认为总路线是和财政经济工作有关、和文艺工作关系不大的错误思想，说明文艺工作者在国家过渡时期对于教育人民、提高人民社会主义觉悟方面负有重大的责任。他指出四年来西北的文艺工作基本上是沿着总路线方向前进的，但和国家建设的发展速度相比，文艺工作则显得较为落后，赶不上人民的需要；劳动人民中的英雄模范人物很少在作品中、舞台上出现，对旧的传统的坏习气很少在作品中予以应有的揭露和批判，对损害社会主义和半社会主义因素的资本主义思想进行批判的作品还出现的很少，表现个体农民形象的较多，表现组织起来的农民的形象就很不够，表现先进工人的作品更少，因而人们从文艺作品中不能得到更大的教育和鼓舞。关于历史剧，赵伯平同志指出应该多多反映历史上农民起义的领袖和爱国主义的英雄等人民各种斗争的历史事迹。应该保留优秀的好的神话剧和历史剧，因这些题材是能够直接或间接的教育和鼓舞人民，为总路线服务。最后，他指出：文艺工作的中心就是创作，今后为了更好地创作，更好地为总路线服务，必须深入地学习总路线，了解总路线的实质，才能在作品中正确地反映党的政策，才能正确地认识生活，反映生活；必须深入到实际斗争生活中去，才能创作出有骨有肉的作品；必须结合总路线的学习，努力改造自己。此外，还应该提高艺术技巧，重视加强文艺界的团结。
    反对公式化概念化
    浙江省文艺工作者两个多月来创作了六百余件宣传总路线的文艺作品，其中有一百多个剧本，四十多件说唱，五十多件美术作品和歌曲创作，以及其他多种多样的文艺形式的作品。浙江省文联已编印了文艺宣传资料四辑；有的由浙江人民出版社出版单行本；尚有一部分刊载于“浙江文艺”月刊上。这些配合总路线总任务宣传的文娱剧目，已在新年和春节前后，由各地农村剧团、业余剧团普遍作了宣传演出。
    这次文艺创作在数量上的收获是不小的，但一般作品的质量较低，采用的稿件只占来稿总数百分之十左右。这些没有采用的稿件，最大的毛病，还是公式化与概念化的问题：一般稿件取材范围比较狭隘，情节安排也大致相同。除了一个故事骨架外，其余都是干巴巴的说教，这样的作品当然没有感动人的力量了。其次，歪曲人物性格的描写，在一般作品中也有发现。
    为了克服这些毛病，更深入一步地进行宣传总路线的创作，浙江省文联已通过“浙江文艺”月刊，要求作者们正确地理解生活，把取材的范围放得宽广一些。特别要求作者们深入生活实际，从生活中间多方面地去发掘题材，避免内容单调，形式枯燥，多创作短小精悍、便于唱出和演出的作品。
