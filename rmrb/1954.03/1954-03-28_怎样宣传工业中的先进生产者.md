How to Publicize Advanced Producers in Industry
Gu Yan Zhi

Vigorously publicizing the experiences of advanced producers, actively supporting all the initiatives of workers and peasants, and mobilizing the people to learn from their examples is an important task of economic propaganda for newspapers. Lenin said in "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government": "After the transfer of power to the proletariat... the power of example... for the first time has the possibility of showing its broad influence." In "On the Nature of Our Newspapers," Lenin further pointed out: "We rarely use vivid and concrete examples and models from all aspects of life to educate the masses—and this is the main task of newspapers during the transition period from capitalism to communism." Lenin's instructions are of great significance to our newspaper workers as well.

Advanced producers are the banners representing the new level of labor productivity achieved. Under the same working conditions, advanced producers can create new labor productivity and improve production levels by improving operating techniques, working methods, or reforming equipment. If their experience can be mastered by more people, it can create more wealth for the country. Therefore, publicizing the experience of advanced producers is an important way to attract and motivate the broad masses of workers to improve labor productivity on the existing basis. What is the significance of improving labor productivity? Lenin taught: “Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and main condition for ensuring the victory of the new socialist system.” [Note 1] Stalin also taught: “Why can socialism, should socialism, and will socialism certainly defeat the capitalist economic system? It is because it can create higher labor models and higher labor productivity than the capitalist economic system. It is because it can give society more products and make society more prosperous than the capitalist economic system.” [Note 2]

It seems that the problem is very obvious. However, not all newspapers can always pay attention to publicizing the experience of advanced producers. Some newspapers believe that the experience of advanced producers is only the activity of individual people, without "huge scale" or "enthusiastic atmosphere." Therefore, they are only obsessed with "creating" comprehensive reports that can include national or regional events; reflecting the situation of various business conferences; publishing business instructions and orders and dull and poor summary reports. Some newspapers only get lively when labor model conferences are held, publishing some speeches or photos of individual advanced producers, but usually ignore them. Some newspapers are limited to publicizing the past achievements and activities of existing advanced producers, and rarely report on current activities; and pay even less attention to continuously discovering and reporting the achievements of new advanced producers... These situations must obviously be changed quickly.

In order to strengthen the publicity of the various initiatives of advanced producers, the most important thing is that newspaper workers must care about all the fundamental issues in social life, go deep into the core of the current struggle, and carefully discover the new sprouts of new things. In 1952, the supply of red bricks in Shenyang was far behind the actual needs of the basic construction department. At that time, the labor productivity in the kiln industry was low, with an average daily output of only 750 bricks per person; but in fact, it must reach 1,000 bricks to meet the needs, otherwise it would affect the progress of basic construction. At this time, after discovering the phenomenon of unreasonable labor organization in the kiln industry during an interview, a reporter from the Shenyang Daily further discovered that a team in the fourth site of Kiln Industry No. 1 had improved the labor organization, implemented a reasonable division of labor, and significantly improved production efficiency, but due to lack of leadership, it formed a spontaneous flow and was not promoted. The Shenyang Daily discovered and promoted this experience, which found a way to overcome the difficulties. This kind of publicity is obviously timely and powerful.

After mastering the typical cases of advanced producers, the newspaper must also see from the advanced thinking and advanced experience of advanced people the main requirements of the current social life development reflected in these advanced thinking and advanced experience. Zhang Mingshan's creation of the anti-encircling disc reflects the fact that after the old enterprises, even colonial enterprises, are transferred to the hands of the people, production reforms must be further carried out in order to fully exert labor efficiency. Therefore, the promotion of Zhang Mingshan's experience is not only needed in the steel rolling industry, but also a common requirement of all enterprises with old equipment. Wang Chonglun's creation is an important factor in implementing balanced production at a higher level, giving full play to equipment utilization, and promoting the completion of national construction plans. This is also a common requirement of existing state-owned enterprises. Therefore, the promotion of Wang Chonglun's experience is also of universal and important significance. If newspapers want to truly walk in front of real life and guide real life, they must not only see the specific deeds of a certain advanced person, but also see the requirements of universal significance in social life from these specific deeds and specific activities, so as to mobilize and organize the entire working people to work hard to solve the main problems in current work, thereby powerfully promoting the cause of national construction.

The advanced producers who appear in a certain period cannot but reflect the main characteristics of social life at that time. This point must also be well grasped when reporting on advanced producers. The Changchun Daily once conducted a systematic investigation in a factory. The results of the investigation show that: when production has not yet been completed and many problems that should be solved have not yet been solved, some people have found many "tricks" by giving play to the spirit of hard struggle and improving operating methods. One day, the lathe team in this factory found nine "tricks," and the workers said that this was "a year when tricks are running all over the ground as long as you use your brain." In this way, an advanced team and three advanced producers appeared in production. These advanced producers cannot but reflect the production situation at that time. However, because the leadership did not pay enough attention to the ideological and technical education of the workers, these advanced producers did not continue to play a model leading role in the new environment. The new environment requires a higher level of technology; new equipment and new technologies require corresponding organization and discipline. Without these, it will not only be impossible to give play to the role of advanced producers, but even continue working will be difficult. Therefore, this requires newspapers to see the characteristics of the construction situation when advanced producers appear when reporting on advanced producers, and reflect these characteristics. At the same time, in different stages of the development of the national construction cause, new requirements for advanced producers are put forward in the new environment, promoting and guiding advanced producers to continuously move forward in order to adapt to the needs of the development of the national construction cause. It is wrong not to pay attention to consolidating and cultivating existing advanced producers.

When publicizing the creations of advanced producers, it is impossible not to see that these creations are not imagined out of thin air, nor are they produced in isolation from historical development, but grow on the basis of the collective wisdom of the working class's long-term labor. As Stalin said: "Millions of laborers, workers and peasants, are working, living and fighting. They are not living in vain. When they live and fight, they certainly accumulate a wealth of practical experience—who can doubt this?" [Note 3] When many newspapers publicize advanced producers, they often only publicize the role of advanced producers as individuals in isolation, without specifically explaining the leading role of the Party, and without cultivating the collectivist spirit of the working people through the publicity of advanced producers. Some reporters, in order to prominently publicize advanced producers, write collective labor as the individual activities of advanced producers, and add the experimental achievements made by people before to one person currently being praised. This is not only theoretically wrong, but also inconsistent with the facts. At a symposium, Zhang Mingshan criticized the "Worker's Life" newspaper in Anshan, pointing out that the newspaper wrote the activities of their dozen-person research team as his personal activities. Newspaper workers must pay attention not to publicize advanced producers in isolation from the leadership of the Party, from the collective wisdom of the entire working class, and from historical reality; and even more so, not to publicize advanced producers in opposition to the entire working masses and technicians; publicizing advanced producers is to make advanced producers grow more firmly and solidly among the broad masses of workers, and must never make them gradually leave the collective of the working masses.

When publicizing the creations and inventions of advanced producers, it is also necessary to have a scientific attitude. However, many newspapers write the creations and inventions as formulaic and simplified when conducting this kind of publicity. When writing about an advanced worker, instead of writing about how he studies technology, they publicize how he doesn't sleep for a few days and doesn't eat for a few meals; when writing about workers' creations and inventions, they don't pay attention to reflecting the cooperation between workers and technicians, the combination of labor and technology, but instead readily find a backward technician as a foil. Sometimes, they even write a person's spirit of research as an unreasonable dementia situation, and write his creations and inventions as suddenly appearing. When newspapers explain the ideological growth process of advanced producers, they often do not mainly analyze through facts in work and life, but routinely talk about how he suffered before liberation and how happy he is today. This kind of propaganda report that violates scientific principles and lacks profound ideological analysis cannot show the concrete struggle process of the new thinking of advanced producers overcoming the old thinking, and specifically point out to people the path to learn from advanced producers.

Regularly publicizing the various activities of advanced producers has become an increasingly common requirement of the broad masses of readers. At the three reader symposiums held by the "Worker's Life" newspaper in Anshan last year, readers all raised this requirement. Newspaper workers have a responsibility to meet this completely reasonable requirement of the readers. To this end, the newspaper editorial department must maintain close and extensive contact with all aspects of social life, be familiar with the current struggle, and go deep into the core of the struggle. At the same time, it must also be familiar with the basic knowledge of economic work. The most harmful view here is to require advanced producers and advanced experiences to be perfect, thinking that the creative nature of the masses' sprouts is "nothing great." If this view is not overcome, it will hinder the in-depth discovery of advanced producers, advanced ideas, and advanced experiences. Stalin taught: "Sometimes, the people who open up new roads in science and technology are not famous people in the scientific community, but ordinary people, practitioners, and innovators who are not famous in the scientific community at all." [Note 4]

Newspaper workers are not familiar with the advanced producers in their own regions, which greatly hinders the in-depth publicity of advanced producers. There was such a thing, Chen Fangchun, a carpenter from the Shenyang Garment Factory No. 1, created the wadding walking-track machine. Two newspapers reported on this matter, but one wrote Chen Fangchun and the other wrote Chen Chunfang, and finally there was no way to prove which name was correct. When asked the editors, reporters, and group leaders of the two newspapers, none of them could confirm which name was correct. It should not be too much to ask that any local newspaper must be familiar with the advanced producers in its own region and regularly understand their activities.

The purpose of publicizing advanced producers is to promote the broad masses to learn from them. However, many newspapers often complete the task after publicizing, without paying attention to the effect, let alone organizing the masses to learn from the advanced thinking and experience of advanced producers. Obviously this is wrong. At any time, newspapers should not abandon their role as collective organizers. In this regard, the Northeast Daily's publicity of Wang Chonglun in the past few months has been more effective. The Northeast Daily not only reported on Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking and advanced experience, but also sent reporters to Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory, where Wang Chonglun worked, and to Shenyang and Harbin to organize symposiums, promoting the relevant departments in the above-mentioned areas to publicize and promote Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking and experience, and also reported on the learning of Wang Chonglun in various places in a timely and continuous manner. After adopting this approach, the Northeast Daily has begun to change the situation of not publicizing advanced producers frequently and prominently for a considerable period of time, and thereby promoted the development of the Wang Chonglun production innovation movement in factories and mines in Northeast China. This shows that once the newspaper exerts its initiative, it can gradually make the publicity of advanced producers continuous, regular, and prominent. [Note 1] Lenin: "The Great Initiative."

    怎样宣传工业中的先进生产者
    顾言之
    大力宣传先进生产者的经验，积极支持工人和农民的一切创举，并动员人民学习他们的榜样，这是报纸经济宣传的一项重要任务。列宁在“苏维埃政权底当前任务”中曾说：“在政权转归无产阶级掌握以后，……榜样底力量……第一次有可能来表现自己的广大影响。”在“论我们报纸的性质”一文中，列宁进一步指出：“我们很少用生活各方面的生动具体的例子和榜样来教育群众，——而这是从资本主义向共产主义过渡的时期内报纸的主要任务。”列宁的这些指示，对我国报纸工作者同样有着十分重要的意义。
    先进生产者是代表着劳动生产率所达到的新的水平的旗帜。在同样的劳动条件之下，先进生产者由于改进了操作技术、工作方法或者改革了设备，就能创造新的劳动生产率，提高生产水平。假如他们的经验能为更多的人所掌握，那就可以给国家创造出更多的财富。因此，宣传先进生产者的经验，乃是吸引和带动广大劳动群众，在现有的基础上，提高劳动生产率的重要方法。提高劳动生产率有什么意义呢？列宁教导说：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的条件。”〔注一〕斯大林也教导说：“为什么社会主义能够，应当而且一定会战胜资本主义经济体系呢？就是因为它比资本主义经济体系能作出更高的劳动模范，更高的劳动生产率。就是因为它比资本主义经济体系能给予社会更多的产品，能使社会更加富足起来。”〔注二〕
    看来，问题是十分明显的。但是并非所有的报纸，都能经常注意宣传先进生产者的经验。有的报纸，认为先进生产者的经验，只是个别人物的活动，既没有“巨大的规模”，也没有“热烈的气氛”，因而只迷恋于“创作”能包括全国性或全区性事件的综合报道；反映各种业务性会议的情况；刊登业务性的指示命令和枯燥贫乏的总结报告。有的报纸只是在开劳动模范会议时热闹一阵，刊登一些讲话或个别先进生产者的照片，而平时则不闻不问。有的报纸，只局限于宣传已有的先进生产者的过去的成就及其活动，对于当前的活动就很少报道；更不注意不断发现和报道新的先进生产者的成就……。这些情况，显然必须迅速予以改变。
    为了加强宣传先进生产者的各种创举，最重要的是报纸工作者必须关心社会生活中的一切根本问题，深入到当前斗争的核心中去，细心地发现新事物的幼芽。一九五二年沈阳市红砖的供应，远远落后于基本建设部门的实际需要。当时窑业中的劳动生产率低，每人平均日产量只达到七百五十块；而实际上必须达到一千块才能满足需要，否则就要影响基本建设的进度。这时，沈阳日报记者在采访中发现窑业中劳动组织不合理的现象后，进而发现窑业一厂第四现场有一个小组曾经改善了劳动组织，实行合理分工，生产效率显著提高，但是由于缺乏领导，形成自流，没有推广。沈阳日报发现和推广了这个经验，这就找到了克服困难的途径。这种宣传显然是及时的和有力的。
    掌握了先进生产者的典型事例以后，报纸还必须从先进人物的先进思想、先进经验中，看出这些先进思想和先进经验中所反映出的当前社会生活发展的主要要求。张明山所创造的反围盘，正是反映了旧的企业甚至殖民地企业转入到人民手中之后，必须进一步进行生产改革，以便充分发挥劳动效率。因此，推广张明山的经验，不只在轧钢工业上是需要的，也是所有具有旧设备的企业的共同要求。王崇伦的创造，是在更高的水平上，实行均衡生产，充分发挥设备运用率，并推动完成国家建设计划的重要因素。这也是现有国营企业共同的要求。因此，推广王崇伦的经验，也是具有普遍的重要意义的。报纸要想真正走在现实生活的前面，指导现实生活，就必须不只是看到某一先进人物的具体事迹，而且要从这些具体事迹、具体活动中看出社会生活中带有普遍意义的要求，以便动员和组织全体劳动人民，为解决当前工作中的主要问题而努力，从而有力地推进国家建设事业。
    在一定时期出现的先进生产者，不能不反映着当时社会生活中的主要特点。这一点，也是在报道先进生产者的时候必须很好掌握的。长春新报曾经在一个工厂作过系统的调查工作。调查的结果表明：在生产尚未就绪，许多应该解决的问题还未解决的时候，有的人由于发挥了艰苦奋斗的精神，改进操作方法，找出很多“窍门”。这个工厂的车工小组有一天曾找出九个“窍门”，工人们说，这是“只要动动脑，窍门就满地跑的年头”。就这样，在生产中出现了一个先进小组和三个先进生产者。这些先进生产者不能不反映着当时生产的状况。但是由于领导上对工人的思想教育和技术教育重视不够，因而这些先进生产者在新的环境下，就没有继续发挥模范带头作用。新的环境，要求有较高的技术水平；新的设备、新的技术，要求与之相适应的组织性、纪律性。做不到这些，不仅不能发挥先进生产者的作用，甚至继续工作下去都是困难的。因此，这就要求报纸在报道先进生产者的时候，要看到先进生产者出现时的建设情况的特点，反映这些特点。同时，在国家建设事业发展的不同阶段，提出新的环境对先进生产者的新的要求，推动与指导先进生产者不断前进，以便适应国家建设事业发展的需要。不重视巩固与培养已有的先进生产者是不对的。
    宣传先进生产者的创造的时候，不能不看到，这些创造不是凭空想出来的，也不是脱离历史的发展孤立地产生的，而是在工人阶级长年劳动的集体智慧的基础上生长起来的。正如斯大林所说：“千百万劳动者，工人和农民，是在劳动着，生活着，奋斗着。他们并不是白白生活着，他们生活奋斗时，当然也就积蓄着很丰富的实践经验，——这一点有谁能够怀疑呢？”〔注三〕许多报纸宣传先进生产者的时候，常常只是孤立地宣传先进生产者个人的作用，没有具体说明党的领导作用，没有通过先进生产者的宣传，培养劳动人民的集体主义精神。有的记者为了突出地宣传先进生产者，把集体性的劳动写成先进生产者的个人的活动，把以前人们所作的试验成就都加在目前表扬的一个人身上。这不仅从理论上来说是错误的，而且也是不符合事实的。在一次座谈会上，张明山就曾批评过鞍山“工人生活”报，指出报纸把他们十几个人的研究小组的活动，写成他个人的活动。报纸工作者必须注意，不要离开了党的领导、离开了整个工人阶级的集体智慧和历史现实，孤立地宣传先进生产者；更不要把先进生产者和整个工人群众以及技术人员对立起来去宣传；宣传先进生产者，是为了使先进生产者更稳固更坚实地在广大劳动群众中生长起来，决不能使他们反而逐渐离开了劳动群众的集体。
    宣传先进生产者的创造与发明时，还必须要有科学的态度。但是，许多报纸在进行这种宣传时，却把创造发明写得公式化简单化。写一个先进工人，不是写他如何钻研技术，而是宣扬几天不睡觉、几餐不吃饭；写工人的创造发明时，不注意反映工人和技术人员的合作、劳动和技术的结合，反而顺手找一个落后的技术人员作陪衬。有时，甚至把一个人的钻研精神写成不合情理的痴呆情况，把他的创造与发明写成突然问世的。报纸在说明先进生产者的思想生长过程时，常常不是主要地通过工作和生活中的事实来进行分析，而是老一套地讲他在解放前如何受苦，在今天如何幸福。这种违反科学原则和缺乏深刻思想分析的宣传报道，就不能表明先进生产者的新思想战胜旧思想的具体的斗争过程，而具体地向人们指出学习先进生产者的道路。
    经常地宣传先进生产者的各方面的活动，已经成为广大读者的日益普遍的要求。在鞍山“工人生活”报去年召开的三次读者座谈会上，读者都提出了这个要求。报纸工作者有责任满足读者的这个完全合理的要求。为此，报纸编辑部必须和社会生活各方面保持密切的、广泛的联系，熟悉当前的斗争，深入到斗争的核心中去，同时也必须熟悉经济工作的基本知识。这里最有害的观点，是要求先进生产者、先进经验必须是十全十美的，认为群众的萌芽性质的创造，是“没有什么了不起的”。如果不克服这种观点，就会妨碍深入发现先进生产者、先进思想、先进经验。斯大林教导说：“有时候，开拓科学和技术新道路的，竟不是在科学界著名的人物，而是在科学界全不著名的人物，平凡的人物，实践家，工作革新者。”〔注四〕
    报纸工作者不熟悉本地区的先进生产者，这也大大妨碍了对先进生产者的深入宣传。有过这样一件事情，沈阳被服一厂木工陈芳春创造了絮行打道机，有两个报纸报道了这件事，但是一个写的是陈芳春，一个写的是陈春芳，终于没法证明那个名字对。问过两个报纸的编辑、记者和组长，都不能肯定那个名字对。任何一个地方报纸，必须熟悉本地区的先进生产者，并经常了解他们的活动情况，这应该不是过高的要求。
    宣传先进生产者的目的，为的是推动广大群众向他们学习。但是不少报纸往往宣传了，任务也就完了，而不注意效果，更不注意组织群众学习先进生产者的先进思想和经验。显然这是不对的。任何时候，报纸都不应该放弃自己的集体的组织者的作用。在这一方面，最近几个月来东北日报对王崇伦的宣传，是较有成效的。东北日报不只报道了王崇伦的先进思想、先进经验，又派记者到王崇伦工作的鞍钢机械总厂和沈阳、哈尔滨两地组织座谈会，推动上述地区各有关部门宣传推广王崇伦的先进思想和经验，而且及时地连续地报道了各地学习王崇伦的情况。东北日报采用这样的作法后，已开始改变了相当长时期内宣传先进生产者不经常不突出的状况，并从而推动了东北各地厂矿企业中学习王崇伦生产革新运动的开展。这说明报纸一旦发挥了它的主动性，就能使先进生产者的宣传逐步作到连续、经常和突出。〔注一〕列宁：“伟大的创举”。“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷，第五九七页。〔注二〕、〔注三〕斯大林：“在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说”。“列宁主义问题”，莫斯科中文版，第六五四页—六五五页、六六八页—六六九页。〔注四〕斯大林：“在克列姆里宫招待高级学校工作人员时的演说”。“列宁文选”第二卷，第六十页。
