    Strengthen the Protection of Production Equipment
    Modern industrial production is machine production, relying on complex mechanical and electrical equipment. Mechanical equipment is the material foundation of industrial production and a precious asset of the motherland. Enterprise leaders are entrusted by the state to manage this equipment and use it for the motherland's production. Everyone should take good care of it so that this equipment is always in good condition and serves the motherland for a longer time.
    However, the protection of equipment in many enterprises is currently very poor. According to incomplete statistics, in 1953, due to equipment accidents, blast furnaces produced 8,700 tons less iron; open-hearth furnaces produced 8,900 tons less steel; rolling mills produced 21,000 tons less steel. In the Northeast region alone, non-ferrous metal plants and mines had 1,250 equipment accidents of various sizes. Major equipment accidents in the cement system resulted in nearly 20,000 hours of downtime, reducing cement production by 68,000 tons. In the power industry, there were more than 700 power generation accidents and more than 4,800 line accidents in ten months, resulting in a loss of 7.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Equipment damage in the machinery manufacturing system is also very serious. Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant had as many as 1,475 accidents throughout 1953. The paper industry had 1,600 accidents from January to October last year. In just five industrial sectors, work stoppages due to accidents amounted to more than 2.3 million workdays in ten months last year, equivalent to more than 6,000 people not working for a year. This is an important factor in our unbalanced production, poor task completion, poor quality, and frequent disruption of enterprise work plans.
    The reasons for these equipment accidents, apart from a very small number due to force majeure such as natural disasters and historical problems that cannot be resolved for a long time or are difficult to remedy in the short term, are mostly due to poor maintenance, violations of operating procedures, lack of planned maintenance, and poor maintenance quality. That is to say, the vast majority of equipment accidents are caused by subjective reasons. Obviously, each accident not only affects production and endangers personal safety, but also inevitably damages the equipment and shortens its service life.
    What is even more serious is that the working environment in some enterprises is dirty and filthy, with garbage and dust everywhere, discipline is lax, and order is not maintained. The state's valuable equipment is unattended, operating arbitrarily under overload, and not being inspected or maintained, so that many important equipment are often producing under very dangerous conditions, and accidents can happen at any time.
    In some enterprises, because no one is responsible for equipment management, many valuable equipment, spare parts, and tools are discarded everywhere, exposed to wind and rain. Motors, lathes, metallurgical equipment, tools, etc. in warehouses are often accumulated for many years, and those that can be used are not utilized. The parts of some large equipment are scattered and discarded at will, and the loss is very alarming.
    The root cause of these many phenomena is that some leading cadres in our enterprises do not have a sufficient understanding of the serious significance of protecting state equipment. Many leading cadres do not carefully understand the characteristics and defects of the enterprise's equipment, and use, maintain, and repair it according to the characteristics and needs of various equipment themselves. They often only care about "production" and do not care about maintenance and repair, and do not cherish equipment but use it roughly. When formulating plans, they only stipulate production tasks, arbitrarily squeeze out maintenance time, and put production and equipment care in opposition to each other.
    Secondly, there is a lack of education for the majority of employees in enterprises on equipment maintenance, compliance with operating procedures, and strict labor discipline. It has not been possible to make all employees realize that they are the masters of the equipment, and that it is their glorious responsibility to use, maintain, and repair these equipment correctly, and to contribute to accelerating the realization of national industrialization.
    Thirdly, no one is responsible for equipment maintenance and maintenance work in the enterprise, and the equipment system work is extremely weak. Equipment work often lacks centralized and unified leadership; idle equipment is not in charge; production equipment is not regularly inspected and repaired; spare parts are not managed; on the one hand, the mechanical repair department is waiting for materials to stop work, wasting manpower, and on the other hand, the production of spare parts cannot meet the needs of maintenance.
    It should be admitted that the vast majority of equipment in existing production enterprises are old equipment left over from imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Generally, they are old and damaged, and most of the idle equipment has been scattered. This naturally increases the difficulty of our work. However, we must never conclude from this that we should not cherish these equipment, or that we cannot protect these equipment. On the contrary, precisely because the equipment is old, we should pay more attention to protecting them and make every effort to maintain and restore their good condition.
    Today, we are in a period of great shortage of mechanical equipment, and every machine and every part we have is an important part of our realization of national industrialization, and must be treasured and cherished. All enterprise leaders must understand that protecting state property in the enterprise and cherishing equipment is their important responsibility. At the same time, with the increasing number of new enterprises, new, mechanized, and automated equipment will increase, and protecting these equipment so that they are not damaged prematurely will be an even more important responsibility. We should educate and mobilize all employees of the enterprise to wage a tenacious struggle against various phenomena of damage and lack of care for state equipment. Give full play to the spirit of ownership of the people's wealth of all personnel and eliminate the attitude of indifference to equipment. Those who repeatedly fail to correct themselves after being warned, are careless, and arbitrarily damage equipment should be given necessary punishment.
    Accepting the lessons of past equipment accidents and damage, all enterprise systems should quickly establish and improve the mechanical and electrical equipment departments, allocate appropriate cadres, and strengthen the work of these departments, so that they can truly grasp the existing equipment and ensure that there is someone responsible for equipment work in an enterprise. Some enterprises should establish a chief mechanic and chief power engineer system in accordance with Soviet experience.
    We should vigorously strengthen equipment maintenance and maintenance, formulate equipment use and maintenance systems, equipment inspection systems, and explain the truth to all workers and cadres, teaching them how to use and maintain them. We must formulate some practical measures to keep the workshop and equipment clean and constantly strengthen labor discipline.
    In order to ensure the safe operation of equipment, we must improve maintenance work. The maintenance plan must be prepared at the same time as the enterprise plan and incorporated into the enterprise plan as an integral part of it. Daily repairs must be included in the regular work plan to give a real guarantee. Implement regular inspections to achieve the purpose of planned maintenance, and strengthen the management of spare parts to ensure that important equipment has sufficient spare parts.

    加强生产设备的保护工作石章
    现代的工业生产是机器生产，它是依靠着复杂的机械和电气设备来进行的。机械设备是工业生产的物质基础，是祖国的宝贵财产。企业的领导干部受着国家的委托来掌管这些设备，运用它为祖国生产，大家就应当很好地爱护它，使这些设备经常处于一种良好的状态下，更长期地为祖国效劳。
    但是，目前不少企业对于设备的保护工作是做得很差的，根据不完全的统计，一九五三年由于设备事故，炼铁炉少产生铁八千七百吨；平炉少产钢八千九百吨；轧钢机少产钢材二万一千吨。仅东北地区有色金属厂矿即发生大小设备事故一千二百五十次。水泥系统主要设备事故停车近两万小时，减产水泥六万八千吨。电力工业在十个月中发电事故就有七百多次，线路事故有四千八百多次，损失电量达七百五十万度。机械制造系统设备损坏现象也很严重，齐齐哈尔第一机床厂一九五三年全年事故竟达一千四百七十五次。造纸工业去年一至十月发生事故一千六百次。仅五个工业部门去年十个月中因事故停工就达二百三十多万个工日，约等于六千多人一年没有工作。这是我们生产不均衡，任务完成不好、质量不好、企业作业计划经常被打乱的一个重要因素。
    这些设备事故发生的原因，除了极少数是由于自然灾害和历史上遗留的问题长期不能解决等不可抗拒或短期内难以补救的缘故外，绝大部分是由于维护不良，违反操作规程，缺乏有计划地检修和检修质量低劣而产生的。这就是说，绝大部分设备事故是由于主观原因所产生的。很显然，每发生一次事故不仅是影响生产，危害人身安全，而且必然损害了设备，缩短了设备使用寿命。
    更加严重的是有些企业的作业环境肮脏不堪，垃圾尘埃到处皆是，纪律松弛，不守秩序；国家宝贵的设备无人照管，任意超负荷运转，不加以检查保养，使得许多重要设备经常是处于很危险的情况下生产，随时随刻都可能发生事故。
    有些企业由于设备管理无人负责，许多贵重设备、备品、工具到处丢弃，任凭风吹雨打。仓库中的马达、车床、冶金设备、工具等往往多年积压，可以使用的也不加以利用。有的大型设备零件分散，随意弃置，其损失是十分惊人的。
    产生这许多现象的根本原因，是我们企业中的若干领导干部对保护国家设备的严重意义认识不足。有许多领导干部并不去仔细了解企业设备的特点、缺陷，并根据各种设备本身的特点与需要加以使用、保养和检修。他们往往只顾“生产”，不顾保养和检修，不是爱护设备而是粗暴地使用设备。制订计划时只规定生产任务，任意挤掉检修时间，把生产与爱护设备对立起来。
    其次，就是企业中还缺乏对广大职工进行设备维护保养、遵守操作规程和严格劳动纪律的教育。没有能使全体职工认识到自己是设备的主人，认识到正确使用这些设备，维护和修理这些设备是自己光荣的责任，是对加速实现国家工业化的贡献。
    再次，就是企业中的设备检修维护工作无人负责，设备系统工作极为薄弱。设备工作往往没有集中统一的领导；闲置设备无人负责；生产设备没有定期检查和修理；备品无人管理；机修部门一方面是停工待料，浪费力量，一方面是备品生产不能满足检修的需要。
    应当承认，现有生产企业的设备绝大部分还是帝国主义、官僚资本遗留下来的旧设备。一般皆已老旧破损，闲置设备则多已零散。这自然使我们工作增加了困难。但绝不能从此得出结论，认为就不应爱护这些设备，或者就无法保护这些设备。相反的，正因为设备老旧才应当更加注意去保护它们，尽最大努力使这些设备保持和恢复它的良好状态。
    我们今天正处在机械设备十分缺乏的时期，现有的每一台机器和每一个零件，都是我们实现国家工业化的重要组成部分，都必须加以珍贵和爱护。所有的企业领导干部都必须懂得，保护企业中的国家财产，爱护设备是自己的重大责任。同时，随着新建企业的日益增多，新的、机械化、自动化设备将增多起来，保护这些设备，使之不过早地受到损坏，将是更加重要的责任。应当教育并动员企业的全体职工向各种损坏与不爱护国家设备的现象作坚韧的斗争。发挥全体人员对人民财富的主人翁精神，消除对设备漠不关心的态度。对那些屡戒不改，漫不经心，任意使设备损坏的人，应该给以必要的惩处。
    接受过去设备事故损坏的教训，各企业系统都应迅速把机电设备部门建立与健全起来，调配适当的干部，加强这一部门工作，使之确能掌握起现有设备，使设备工作在一个企业里能确实有专人负责。一部分企业应按苏联经验建立总机械师与总动力师制度。
    应当大力加强设备保养、维护工作，制订设备的使用与维护制度，设备的检查制度，并向所有工人和干部讲清道理，教给他们使用的方法和保养维护的方法。要制订一些切实的办法保持车间与设备的清洁，不断加强劳动纪律。
    为了保证设备安全运转，必须改善检修工作，检修计划必须与企业计划同时编制，并纳入企业计划之中成为它的一个组成部分。日常修理必须列入经常的作业计划之中给以确实的保证。实行定期检查以达到计划检修的目的，必须加强零件备品的管理工作，保证重要设备有足够的备品。
