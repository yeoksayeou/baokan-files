    陕西省潼关县召开三级干部会议
    对结合生产进行普选作了具体安排
    陕西省潼关县在完成粮食收购任务后，于二月九日至十八日召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，布置和讨论春耕生产和基层选举工作。参加会议的除县、区、乡三级干部外，并有部分乡的互助组组长和积极分子参加。
    会上，中共潼关县委书记杨复兴同志作了春耕生产和普选工作的报告，具体布置了一九五四年和目前春耕生产任务，讲解了普选的政策和要求。同时，会上还介绍了临潼普选试办的经验，并对普选宣传问题以及结合检查政府工作和干部作风、发动妇女参加普选等问题，特别是普选结合生产问题作了专题报告。
    会议经过报告和学习讨论，批判了有些干部认为普选工作不重要和普选与生产不能相结合的错误思想，统一了对生产与普选结合的认识，初步明确了普选的意义和精神，一致认识到农村生产是压倒一切的中心工作，要做好普选必须以生产为中心，服从生产和推动生产；并认识到普选的过程就是教育提高群众社会主义觉悟的过程，做好普选工作就可以进一步发挥、提高人民政治和生产的积极性，进一步巩固人民民主专政，保障国家的经济建设。
    会议根据全县的具体情况，具体安排了结合生产进行普选的步骤和方法。首先各级党、政领导机关对普选和生产进行统一领导、布置、检查、汇报和总结。在普选第一阶段，提出“搞好生产迎接普选”的口号，各乡在召开乡人民代表会议时，订出全乡生产计划；重点整顿互助组，从生产入手，积极领导群众锄麦、积肥、送粪、翻犁与补足已缩小的棉田面积等工作；召开互助组长等各种会议，结合宣传总路线和普选政策，完成人口调查和选民登记工作。第二阶段提出“选举好代表领导好生产，领导好生产争取当选”的口号，各乡在继续整顿互助组的基础上，进行民主管理教育，检查互助组内民主制度，研究解决互利问题，并领导群众进行麦田春灌，追施肥料，锄草及整理棉田，准备棉种等工作，结合完成选好代表及检查政府工作和干部作风。第三阶段以乡为单位掀起小型生产竞赛，各互助组学习先进植棉经验，并将棉田播种等生产工作意见，提交第一次人民代表大会上讨论，并结合整顿好基层政权组织，教育干部建立长期积极领导农村生产的信心。
    会议认为：做好农村基层选举的主要环节除必须贯彻以生产为中心，服从生产、推动生产的方针外，还必须在普选过程中认真作好宣传教育工作，提高干部与群众的觉悟。
    经过三级干部会议的学习和讨论，进一步提高了干部的政治认识，加强了工作信心，各区、乡都订出了生产与普选结合的具体计划，并组成普选生产工作组，于二月十九日分别下达农村，全面开展春季生产和普选工作。
