Shaanxi Province Vigorously Supports the Baoji-Chengdu Railway Project.

Shaanxi Province is vigorously supporting the Baoji-Chengdu Railway project. The sections of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway that pass through Shaanxi province are mostly mountainous, making the engineering exceptionally challenging. Furthermore, the sparse population along the route and inconvenient transportation have made the tasks of land requisition, supplying timber, labor, transportation tools, and providing for the daily needs of the large number of workers extremely arduous and pressing. To vigorously support the early completion of the project, Shaanxi Province, starting from August of last year, successively dispatched full-time cadres and established construction committees at the provincial, prefectural (Hanzhong, Baoji), and county (Baoji, Fengxian, Ningqiang, Lueyang) levels. Twenty-six timber supply stations were established in Ningqiang, Lueyang, Mianxian, and Baocheng to actively carry out various support tasks. Over the past six months, considerable achievements have been made in various support efforts. By the end of January, the counties within the Hanzhong Prefecture had supplied 5,115 cubic meters of timber, 1.3 million kilograms of bamboo, and 3 million kilograms of rice straw. The Hanzhong Trading Branch expanded its supply organization and strengthened its cadre force, basically guaranteeing the supply of daily necessities for the workers. To address the transportation difficulties in the mountainous areas, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Transportation, in coordination with relevant units, is accelerating the construction of a 62-kilometer highway from Mianxian to Lueyang. The Baoji Prefecture, in addition to timely supplying various engineering units with materials and non-staple foods, mobilized more than 2,000 laborers, over 700 livestock, and more than 100 carts in Baoji County (city) to work day and night, completing the construction of transportation access roads and a temporary bridge over the Wei River before the Spring Festival. They also helped solve the temporary accommodation problem for over 10,000 railway construction workers. In addition, the issues of land occupation and resident relocation caused by the railway have been reasonably resolved in some cases after public explanation, and are being studied and addressed in others. Counties such as Lueyang, Ningqiang, and Baoji have also consulted with the masses and adopted leasing methods to solve the problems of temporary land occupation and temporary housing for workers. All of this work has helped the smooth progress of construction preparation.

Currently, the Baoji-Dongheqiao section and the Ningqiang-Lueyang section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, including the Wei River bridge and the Qinling Tunnel project, have commenced construction, and large-scale construction will soon be fully launched. The supply work will become increasingly heavy. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Baoji-Chengdu Railway Construction Committee held a meeting, criticizing the incorrect ideas of individual cadres who were not dedicated to their work and viewed the support tasks as temporary. The meeting made preliminary arrangements for the 1954 support work for railway construction.

    陕西省大力支援宝成铁路工程
    陕西省大力支援宝成铁路工程。宝成铁路在陕西境内所经地区多为山地，工程异常艰巨。又因沿线人烟稀少，交通不便，征购土地，供应工程所需木材、劳力、运输工具和广大职工的生活需要就成了极其繁重而迫切的任务。为了大力支援工程任务早日完成，陕西省于去年八月起先后调配了专职干部，陆续成立了陕西省、专区（汉中、宝鸡）及县（宝鸡、凤县、宁强、略阳）的各级筑路委员会，并在宁强、略阳、沔县、褒成建立了二十六个木材供应站，积极展开各项支援工作。半年多来各项支援工作都取得了相当的成绩。汉中专区各县截至一月底，供应的木材已达五千一百一十五立方公尺，竹子一百三十万公斤，稻草三百万公斤。汉中贸易分公司扩大了供应机构、增强了干部以后，基本上保证了对职工生活的供应。为了解决山区运输的困难，陕西省交通厅在有关单位的配合下，从沔县到略阳正加紧赶修一条长六十二公里的公路。宝鸡专区除及时供应了各工程单位的物资及副食品外，并在宝鸡县（市）动员民工两千多人、牲口七百多头、大车一百多辆，日夜工作，于春节前完成了运输便道及渭河便桥的工程，还帮助解决了一万多修路员工的临时住宿问题。此外，铁路占用土地及居民搬迁问题，经过向群众宣传解释以后，有些已作了合理解决，有些正在研究处理。略阳、宁强、宝鸡等县还与群众协商采取租借的办法，解决了临时占用土地和工人临时住房的问题。所有这些工作，都帮助了施工准备工作的顺利进行。
    现在，宝成铁路宝（鸡）东（河桥）段及宁（强）略（阳）段渭河大桥和秦岭隧道工程已经开工，大规模施工即将全面展开，供应工作将越趋繁重。最近，陕西省宝成铁路筑路工作委员会召开会议，批判了个别干部不安心工作和把支援任务看成是临时性的工作等不正确思想。会议对一九五四年支援筑路工作作了初步安排。
