    Learning from Gold Star Medal Winners

    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently awarded the 1952 "Patriotic丰产 (Feifeng) Gold Star Medal" to Ren Guodong, Secretary of the Party Committee of Guo'erluosi 后旗 (Later Banner) (formerly Zhaoyuan County), a model worker; Li Shunda, a labor model and Director of the Xigou Village Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County; Guo Yu'en, a labor model and Director of the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County; and Wu Chun'an, a labor model and Director of the Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County. This is the highest reward for their outstanding achievements in leading or engaging in agricultural production. At the same time, it also points out living examples and directions for study for rural workers and farmers across the country.
    Commending and rewarding heroic and model figures and universally promoting their advanced experience is one of the important policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and also one of the important leadership methods taught by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the past few years, thanks to the attention of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, many advanced figures have emerged in various departments of the country. In the process of work and production, they have truly played a leading, backbone, and bridging role, greatly promoting the progress of work and production. They have all received various rewards and commendations they deserved. The 1952 "Patriotic 丰产 Gold Star Medal" is the highest reward awarded after review and evaluation on a national scale. Undoubtedly, this is a major event in the agricultural economic sector. It further demonstrates the extreme care of the Party and the state for rural workers, working farmers, and their advanced figures. It will further encourage them to make every effort to give play to their creative labor and strive to improve the level of agricultural production in our country. The current important task for rural workers and all farmers is to work hard in spring plowing and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1954 agricultural production plan.
    Due to the determination of the general line of the transition period, new content and new tasks have been added to industrial production, agricultural production, capital construction, transportation, commercial work, and cultural and educational undertakings in 1954. In this year, all departments of the national economy must complete more and heavier work than last year, and also prepare various conditions for many important tasks in the next few years. Successfully completing the 1954 plan will not only enable our economy to develop a step further and socialist construction to advance a step further, but it is also an important step in completing the Five-Year Plan. What are the specific tasks of agricultural production in 1954? This is to further increase agricultural production on the basis of last year's production, to increase the production of hundreds of billions of catties of grain and millions of dan of cotton this year, and to expand the planting of other cash crops and develop animal husbandry. This task is very arduous, but we must complete and overfulfill it. Because everyone knows that grain production is the foundation of the entire agricultural production. The more grain produced, the more food the state and the people will get, and the greater the support for industrial construction. Cotton and other cash crops are directly supplying raw materials for industrial production. In particular, agricultural production suffered various natural disasters last year. Although the total grain output was not lower than in 1952, the state's production increase plan was not completed, and the cotton harvest was not good. Therefore, increasing agricultural production this year is not only very important for the development of the rural economy, but also for the development of national industry; it is not only very important for changing the current situation of crop production, but also for ensuring future supply.
    The basic method for completing the 1954 agricultural production increase plan is, on the one hand, to vigorously develop the cooperative mutual aid movement and further give play to the superiority of collective management; on the other hand, it is to actively improve production technology and improve the level of agricultural technology. Learning and promoting the existing advanced experience in agricultural production is also an important link. Here, the experiences of Ren Guodong, Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an are living teaching materials for learning. Taking the improvement of agricultural technology as an example, if all our county and district leading comrades can learn from Comrade Ren Guodong, delving into production, summarizing local production increase experiences, and proposing specific organizational and technical measures to increase agricultural production by 50% (or even only 10% or 20%), then it is not difficult to imagine how much grain we should increase each year nationwide, and what a rapid leap forward our agricultural production will appear. As another example, taking the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement as an example, if our more than 14,000 old agricultural production cooperatives and the tens of thousands of new agricultural production cooperatives established this year can learn from the experience of the agricultural production cooperatives of Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, give full play to the superiority of collective management, and effectively carry out agricultural production, so that the agricultural production of the cooperatives not only greatly exceeds the pre-war level, but also greatly exceeds the average yield in the local area, then it can further increase agricultural production, greatly consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, and can affect and drive the further development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    To learn from the "Patriotic 丰产 Gold Star Medal" winners, we should first learn their work style and working methods. In the past, some places did not measure specific conditions and leadership strength, and hastily and rashly moved the specific methods of "equal distance, wide sowing, thinning, and protecting seedlings" in Zhaoyuan County, resulting in detours or failures; while other places were simply unwilling to humbly learn, using the excuse that the experience of Zhaoyuan County was not suitable for the specific conditions of their area, and therefore believed that there was nothing to learn from. Both of these attitudes are wrong, and are due to a failure to understand that what is most important for us is to learn Ren Guodong's work style and working methods, and should not be limited to learning his specific methods. What are Ren Guodong's main work style and working methods? That is, to deeply delve into production, compare and study the farming experience of farmers who have obtained high yields and low yields in the local area, summarize the production increase methods that are suitable for the local farming conditions and are easily accepted by the masses, and then universally publicize and widely promote them. This is also the leadership method taught by Comrade Mao Zedong of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Since there are many counties in our country, and the level of agricultural production in each county is not the same, if the leading comrades in each county can, like Comrade Ren Guodong, deeply delve into production, summarize and study some production increase rules that are suitable for the specific conditions of the local area, and promote them, then we will have a number of Ren Guodong-style model workers in all parts of the country. Therefore, we should believe that Ren Guodong's work style and working methods are possible and should be promoted throughout the country, and county and district cadres and rural workers across the country should learn from him.
    To learn from the "Patriotic 丰产 Gold Star Medal" winners, we should also learn their spirit of loving rural work and focusing on agricultural production. In the past, some rural work cadres and farmers in the suburbs of cities and industrial and mining areas, seeing that cities and industries were developing rapidly year after year, and the living standards of urban residents and workers were relatively high, believed that rural life was too hard and work was also very difficult, so they were uneasy about rural work and blindly flowed into cities; there were also some rural work cadres and farmers who, although they did not move to cities, did not focus on agricultural production. After they had some savings, they engaged in hoarding grain, buying land, or engaging in commercial activities in rural areas, etc., which resulted in the growing development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas. These phenomena have been greatly improved since the vigorous publicity of the general line, due to the improvement of the ideological awareness of farmers, but it is still necessary to combine the education of the general line to publicize the examples of agricultural production cooperatives such as Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an to the vast number of farmers, so that the vast number of farmers can further understand that industry and agriculture are the two legs of socialist construction, and neither can be missing; understand that the only correct path for agricultural economic development is the path of mutual aid and cooperation; understand that in the people's country, the fruits of labor are the most respected, and all speculative and opportunistic behaviors are despicable; understand that there is great potential in agricultural production, and as long as it is managed properly and with the power of mutual aid and cooperation, production can be greatly increased and income can be increased. In short, we must guide the vast number of farmers to learn their model behavior of increasing production, overcoming difficulties, and transforming mountainous areas. If the vast rural areas can achieve the achievements of agricultural production cooperatives such as Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, then our country will have not only in cities, but also in rural areas; not only in the plains, but also in remote mountainous areas a high tide of economic development; the lives of urban and rural people will be further improved.
    While awarding the 1952 "Patriotic 丰产 Gold Star Medal", many places held agricultural labor model conferences last winter and this spring, commending and rewarding batches of people who have achieved outstanding achievements in agricultural production. Gold Star Medal winners and all agricultural labor models are pioneers on the agricultural production front, and they deserve the honor given to them by the people. However, on the one hand, the leading organs in various places must continue to cultivate and educate them, and cannot treat them as figures who are models in everything and have no shortcomings. Therefore, they should not only pay attention to helping them and carrying forward their strengths, but also promptly correct their shortcomings. For agricultural labor models, they should not be asked to take the lead in all kinds of work, making them busy with general political activities and separated from agricultural production. In the past, we have suffered setbacks and made mistakes in this regard, and we should not repeat this mistake in the future. On the other hand, for labor models, the most important thing is to prevent complacency. If they become arrogant because they have been commended, they will gradually separate themselves from leadership and the masses, and eventually become a worthless villain. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly warned us to prevent being dizzy with victory and complacency; the recently held Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also once again pointed out that all arrogance is the most dangerous emotion. This is not only a warning applicable to Communists, but also to the people of the whole country. Therefore, all labor models should resolutely obey the leadership of the Party and the government, continue to deeply maintain close ties with the masses, be vigilant at all times, prevent arrogance and complacency, and forever maintain the honor of the Gold Star Medal and various awards, encourage more people to obtain the Gold Star Medal and various awards, and promote the victorious advance of our great socialist construction and socialist transformation!

    向金星奖章获得者学习
    中央人民政府农业部最近颁发了一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”，奖给郭尔罗斯后旗（前肇源县）旗委书记模范工作者任国栋，平顺县西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社社长劳动模范李顺达，平顺县川底村农业生产合作社社长劳动模范郭玉恩，和翼城县西梁村农业生产合作社社长劳动模范吴春安。这是对他们领导农业生产或者从事农业生产优越成就的最高奖赏，同时，也对全国农村工作者和农民们指出了活的榜样和学习的方向。
    表扬和奖励英雄模范人物，普遍推广他们的先进经验，这是中国共产党和人民政府的重要政策之
  一，也是毛泽东同志教导我们的重要领导方法之一。过去几年来，由于各级党委和人民政府的重视，国家各个部门中都曾涌现了不少的先进人物。他们在工作和生产过程中，真正发挥了带头、骨干和桥梁作用，大大推动了工作和生产的前进；他们都曾分别受到应得的各种奖励和表扬。而一九五二年的“爱国丰产金星奖章”，更是从全国范围内进行审查、评定后颁发的一种最高奖赏，无疑地，这乃是农业经济部门中的一件大事，它进一步表现了党和国家对农村工作者、劳动农民及其先进人物的极度关怀，它也将进一步鼓舞他们尽力发挥创造性的劳动，为提高我国农业生产水平而奋斗。农村工作者和全体农民当前的重要任务，就是努力进行春耕，争取完成和超额完成一九五四年的农业生产计划。
    由于过渡时期总路线的确定，在工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、交通运输、商业工作以及文教事业等方面，一九五四年都增加了新的内容和新的任务。在这一年中，国民经济的各个部门，都要完成比去年更多和更繁重的工作，还要为今后数年中很多重要工作准备各种条件。胜利完成一九五四年的计划，不仅可使我国经济向前发展一步，使社会主义建设前进一步，而且也是完成五年计划的重要一步。一九五四年农业生产的具体任务是什么呢？这就是要在去年生产的基础上，进一步提高农业生产，要在今年增产成百亿斤的谷物和数百万担棉花，并要扩大其它经济作物的种植和发展牧畜事业。这个任务是十分艰巨的，但是我们必须完成和超额完成它。因为大家知道，谷物的生产是整个农业生产的基础，谷物生产越多，国家和人民得到的食粮就越多，工业建设得到的支持也就越大；而棉花及其它经济作物，则更是直接供应工业生产的原料。特别是去年农业生产遭到各种自然灾害，粮食总产量虽然不低于一九五二年，但国家增产计划却没有完成，棉花的收成也不好。因此，提高今年的农业生产，就不仅对农村经济的发展、而且对国家工业的发展也是十分重要的；不仅对改变农作物生产的现状、而且对保证今后供应也是十分重要的。
    完成一九五四年农业增产计划的基本方法，一方面是要大力发展合作互助运动，进一步发挥集体经营的优越性；另一方面是要积极改进生产技术，提高农业技术水平。而学习和推广农业生产中现有的先进经验，又是一个重要的环节。这里，任国栋、李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安的经验，就是学习的活教材。以改进农业技术来说，如果我们所有的县区领导同志，都能学习任国栋同志那样钻研生产，总结当地增产经验，提出具体的组织与技术措施，使农业生产增加百分之五十（甚至只增加百分之十或二十），那末，就不难想像，在全国范围内我们每年该增加多少粮食，我们的农业生产将会出现一个如何飞速跃进的情况啊。又如以发展互助合作运动来说，如果我们的一万四千多个老的农业生产合作社，和今年成立的几万个新的农业生产合作社，都能学习李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安农业生产合作社的经验，充分发挥集体经营的优越性，切实搞好农业生产，使合作社的农业生产不仅大大超过战前水平，也大大超过当地一般产量，那末，也就可以进一步提高农业生产，大大地巩固农业生产合作社，并可影响和带动农业生产互助合作运动的进一步发展。
    向“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者学习，首先应该学习他们的工作作风和工作方法。过去，有些地方不衡量具体条件和领导力量，急躁和草率地搬用肇源县“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”等具体办法，结果走了弯路或遭到失败；而另一些地方，又根本不愿虚心学习，借口肇源县的经验不适合于本地区的具体情况，因而认为一无可取。这两种态度都是错误的，都是由于不了解我们最重要的是要学习任国栋的工作作风和工作方法，而不应局限于学习他的具体办法。任国栋同志主要的工作作风和工作方法是什么呢？这就是深入钻研生产，对比和研究当地获得高产量和低产量的农民的耕作经验，总结出适合于当地耕作条件并易为群众接受的增产办法，然后普遍宣传广泛推行。这也就是毛泽东同志教导我们的从群众中来到群众中去的领导方法。我们全国既然有很多的县，每一个县的农业生产水平又都不是一样高低，如果我们每一个县的领导同志，都能像任国栋同志那样，深入钻研生产，总结和研究出一些适合于当地的具体条件的增产规律，加以推广，那末我们就将会在全国各地出现若干个任国栋式的模范工作者。因此，我们应该认为，任国栋的工作作风和工作方法，是可能而且也应该在全国推广的，全国的县区干部和农村工作者都应该向他学习。
    向“爱国丰产金星奖章”获得者学习，还应该学习他们热爱农村工作和专心农业生产的精神。过去有些农村工作干部和城市与工矿区近郊的农民，看到城市与工业年年都在飞速的发展，城市居民和职工的生活水平也比较高，就认为农村生活太苦，工作也很艰难，于是不安心农村工作，盲目流入城市；还有一些农村工作干部和农民，虽然没有向城市移动，但是也不专心农业生产，他们稍有积蓄后，就在农村中进行囤粮、买地或者经营商业等等不务正业的活动，结果使农村中的资本主义自发势力日益发展。这些现象，在大张旗鼓地宣传总路线以后，由于农民思想觉悟的提高，已经大有改进，但是还必须结合总路线的教育，向广大农民宣传李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安等农业生产合作社的实例，要使广大农民进一步了解工业和农业是社会主义建设的两只脚，缺一不可；了解农业经济发展的唯一正确道路，就是互助合作的道路；了解在人民的国家中，劳动的成果才是最受尊敬的，一切投机取巧的行为都是可鄙的；了解农业生产中的潜力很大，只要经营得法再加上互助合作的力量，就可以大大提高产量，增加收入。总之，要引导广大农民学习他们提高生产、克服困难以及改造山区的模范行为，如果广大农村都能达到李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安等农业生产合作社的成就，那末，我们的国家就不仅在城市、而且在农村；不仅在平原、而且在偏僻的山区都会出现一个经济发展的高潮；城乡人民的生活也将进一步得到改善。
    在颁发一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”的同时，在去年冬天和今年春天，很多地方都召开了农业劳动模范会议，表扬和奖励了成批的在农业生产上获得了卓越成就的人物。金星奖章获得者和所有的农业劳动模范们，他们都是农业生产战线上的开路先锋，他们得到人民给予的荣誉，是完全应该的。但是，一方面，各地领导机关还必须继续对他们进行培养教育，不能把他们当成样样都是模范没有丝毫缺点的人物，因而不只是应该注意经常帮助他们，发扬他们的长处，而且同时应及时纠正他们的缺点。对于农业劳动模范来说更不能要他们样样工作都去带头，使他们忙于一般的政治活动而脱离农业生产。过去，我们在这方面曾受过挫折，犯过错误，今后就不应该再重复这种错误了。另一方面，对于劳动模范们说来，最重要的就是要防止骄傲自满情绪，如果因为受了表扬就骄傲起来，就会逐渐使自己脱离领导、脱离群众，最后变成为一个毫无可取的小人了。毛泽东同志一再告诫我们要防止因胜利而冲昏头脑和骄傲自满；最近召开的中国共产党七届四中全会，也再一次指出一切骄傲情绪都是最危险的情绪。这不仅是对共产党人适用也是对全国人民都适用的警语。因此，一切劳动模范们，都应该坚决服从党和政府的领导，继续深入地和群众取得密切联系，时刻警惕着，防止骄傲和自满，永远保持金星奖章和各种奖励的荣誉，鼓舞更多的人获得金星奖章和各种奖励，推动我们伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业胜利前进！
