After extensively launching promotional activities for the sale of national bonds throughout Shanghai, people from all walks of life have plunged into a wave of subscriptions. During the promotion week from February 15th to 22nd, Shanghai extensively launched publicity for the sale of national bonds. 100,000 propaganda cadres and activists participated in this publicity campaign. In the trade union system, after holding a city-wide mobilization meeting for workers and listening to broadcast reports, more than a million workers successively heard reports related to national bonds, immediately sparking a surge of "promoting, mobilizing, and subscribing simultaneously." The nine suburban districts conducted publicity among township cadres, teachers in people's schools, and propaganda backbone elements, and also carried out publicity to farmers in conjunction with mutual aid and cooperation and spring plowing production. In the business and industrial circles, the propaganda committee members of the district sales sub-committees, after studying, have given 133 reports to business and industrial households. More than 800 sales branches have been formally established in the neighborhoods and women's systems. At the inaugural meetings of the branches, staff members publicized the significance of the state issuing national bonds to neighborhood residents and women. The Shanghai National Bond Sales Committee issued a large number of publicity materials, and the literary and art circles promptly created many songs, clappertales, ballads, and short plays. Many famous movie actors and singing groups went to various cinemas to conduct publicity through speeches and singing; the main actors of the troupes performing in various theaters publicized to the audience before the performance. All 34 cinemas in the city also showed slides every day. Various cultural centers also publicized to the masses through speeches and performed short national bond propaganda programs. All grassroots units also launched publicity activities through blackboard newspapers, broadcasts, and ballads.

After being publicized, people from all walks of life in the city actively subscribed to national bonds. At present, the work of workers subscribing to national bonds is about to be completed. As of February 25th, medical workers had subscribed a total of 6,857.75 million yuan, which is 112.27 percent of the estimated figure; education workers had subscribed a total of 13,275.99 million yuan, which is 249 percent of the estimated figure; the staff of East China level and Shanghai city level organs had subscribed a total amount that has reached about 155 percent of the estimated figure. Suburban farmers are beginning to subscribe, and business and industrial circles and some neighborhood residents are also beginning to subscribe.
