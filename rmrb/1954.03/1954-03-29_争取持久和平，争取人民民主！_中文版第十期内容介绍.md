The tenth issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

The central theme of this issue is the commemoration of the first anniversary of Comrade Stalin's death. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Successor to Lenin's Cause." The editorial points out: The name of Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's immortal cause, is infinitely precious to the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and to progressive people all over the world. Under the new conditions of the proletarian struggle, Lenin creatively developed Marxism. After Lenin's death, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union smashed the traitors and capitulationists, and defeated all attacks by the enemies of the Soviet people on Leninism, thereby defending Leninism and guiding the country to the victory of socialism. The great achievements of the Soviet people in building a socialist society are inseparable from all of Stalin's activities. Stalin summed up the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the modern international liberation movement, creatively developed Marxist-Leninist theory under new historical conditions, and enriched revolutionary theory with new principles on many issues. The editorial then says: Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are striving for a gradual transition to communism and achieved remarkable new achievements last year. The positive influence of the powerful democratic socialist camp on the international situation is growing day by day. Hundreds of millions of people in all countries around the world are fighting tenaciously for lasting and stable peace, and Stalin is the inspirer of this struggle.

This issue contains articles commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death: "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the Leading and Guiding Force of Soviet Society" by Antonín Zápotocký, President of the Czechoslovak Republic and Secretary of the Political Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "Stalin Developed Lenin's Program and Principles on the National Question" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "Stalin - A Great Fighter for Peace and the Security of All Peoples" by Guyot, Member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party.

Zápotocký's article points out: When commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death, the first thing we think of is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the great creation of the genius of Lenin and Stalin, embodying the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. The reason why the revolutionary working-class party is powerful is that it has clear goals and a scientific program, and because it is disciplined and unified. It is precisely because the Communist Party of the Soviet Union firmly abides by these principles that it was able to victoriously overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie and the landlord class, lead the Soviet people to the victory of socialist construction, and take a major step forward on the road of communist construction. The ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical foundations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulated by Lenin and further developed by Stalin, as well as all the activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are models for all Communist and Workers' Parties.

Gheorghiu-Dej's article summarizes the victories achieved by the Lenin-Stalin national policy in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and analyzes Stalin's works and the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, based on the summary of the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the contemporary international liberation movement, further developing Lenin's program and principles on the national question. The article points out: Today, when the "thinkers" of American imperialism are openly advocating the abolition of national sovereignty and the national interests of some countries are being violated, the people of all countries who are fighting for national independence, for peace and socialism, are drawing new strength, hope, and confidence from the great ideas of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin.

Guyot's article says: Millions of men and women in France love and respect J. V. Stalin. Currently, we are engaged in a sharp struggle with the traitors and traitorous forces in France, opposing their extremely reactionary policies that violate national interests. In this situation, Stalin's works on the issue of peace and war and on the national question are of particular significance to us. In the months before his death, Stalin called on us to raise the banner of national independence and national sovereignty, and we vow to hold this banner high until final victory.

Important articles published in this issue also include: an excerpt from the summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party delivered by Vulko Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Minister of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of Bulgarian Communist Party, at the Sixth Party Congress; "The Militant Festival of Great Unity of International Women" by Madame Vaillant-Couturier, General Secretary of the Women's International Democratic Federation; "Chinese Women are Active Builders of a New Socialist Life" by Zhang Yun, Vice-President of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十期已经出版。
    本期的中心内容是纪念斯大林同志逝世一周年。本期以“列宁事业的伟大继承者”为题发表社论。社论指出：列宁不朽事业的伟大继承者斯大林的名字，对于各国共产党和工人党，对于全世界进步人士说来，是无限珍贵的。在无产阶级斗争的新条件下，列宁创造性地发展了马克思主义。列宁逝世之后，苏联共产党在以斯大林为首的中央委员会领导下，粉碎了叛徒和投降分子，击溃了苏联人民的敌人对列宁主义的一切进攻，从而捍卫了列宁主义并引导全国走向社会主义的胜利。苏联人民在建设社会主义社会中的伟大成就是和斯大林的全部活动分不开的。斯大林总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验和现代国际解放运动的经验，在新的历史条件下创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义学说，并在许多问题上以新的原理丰富了革命理论。社论接着说：苏联人民正在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，在共产党的领导下，为逐步过渡到共产主义而奋斗，并在去年取得了卓越的新成就。强大的民主社会主义阵营对国际局势的良好影响一天天扩大。全世界各国的亿万人民正在为持久和稳定的和平而顽强地斗争，斯大林就是这个斗争的鼓舞者。
    本期刊载的纪念斯大林逝世一周年的文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统、捷共中央政治书记处书记萨波托斯基的“苏联共产党是苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会总书记乔治乌—德治的“斯大林发展了列宁关于民族问题的纲领和原理”，法国共产党政治局委员葛约的“斯大林——为和平与各国人民的安全而斗争的伟大战士”。
    萨波托斯基的文章指出：在纪念斯大林逝世一周年的时候，我们首先想到的就是苏联共产党，它是列宁和斯大林的天才的伟大创造，体现了我们这个时代的智慧、荣誉和良知。革命的工人阶级政党之所以有力量，是因为它有明确的目标和科学的纲领，是因为它是有纪律的、统一的。苏联共产党正是因为坚决遵守这些原则，才能胜利地推翻资产阶级和地主阶级的统治，领导苏联人民取得了社会主义建设的胜利，并在共产主义建设的大道上迈进了一大步。列宁制订的并为斯大林进一步发展了的苏联共产党的思想、组织、策略和理论基础，以及苏联共产党的全部活动，是所有共产党和工人党的典范。
    乔治乌—德治的文章综述了列宁—斯大林民族政策在苏联和各人民民主国家中所取得的胜利，并分析了斯大林的著作和苏联共产党的决议，根据苏联社会主义建设的经验和当代国际解放运动的经验的总结，进一步发展了列宁关于民族问题的纲领和原理。文章指出：在美帝国主义的“思想”家正在公开主张取消民族主权，若干国家的民族利益受到侵犯的今天，各国为民族独立、为和平和社会主义而斗争的人民，都从马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的伟大思想中吸取新的力量、希望和信心。
    葛约的文章说：法国千百万男女热爱和尊敬约·维·斯大林。目前，我们正在同法国的卖国贼和卖国势力进行尖锐的斗争，反对他们的违反民族利益的极端反动的政策。在这种情况下，斯大林关于和平与战争问题和关于民族问题的著作，对于我们就有了特别的意义。斯大林在他逝世的前几个月，曾号召我们举起民族独立和民族主权的旗帜，我们立誓要把这面旗帜高高举起，直到最后胜利。
    本期刊载的重要文章还有：保加利亚人民共和国部长会议主席、保加利亚共产党中央政治局委员契尔文科夫在第六次党代表大会上所作的关于保加利亚共产党中央委员会工作总结报告的摘要，国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人的“国际妇女大团结的战斗节日”，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席章蕴的“中国妇女是社会主义新生活的积极建设者”。
