Xinhua News Agency Report:

Comfort mission representatives of the National People's Comfort Mission to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) continued to deeply visit PLA soldiers in various locations.

Representatives of the General Delegation, the First General Sub-Delegation (Volunteer Army), and the Third General Sub-Delegation of the National People's Comfort Mission to the PLA, led by Deputy General Leader Li Zaiwen, arrived at the forefront of the completed section of the Kangzang (Kangding-Tibet) Highway to comfort the road construction troops, military workers, and laborers. When the comfort mission representatives arrived at a certain work section on the night of the 19th, PLA soldiers stood on both sides of the newly built road with lanterns and torches to welcome them. Many units rushed to build spacious new houses for the comfort mission representatives. Above the tent entrances of each unit's station, banners reading "Welcome Our Dear Ones" were hung, along with large couplets and slogans expressing determination to build the road well. Some couplets read: "The roar of cannons opening mountains, overturning rivers and seas, makes imperialists tremble with fear! Dear ones arrive, hearts burst with joy, plateau soldiers create extraordinary feats!" "Who says Kangzang is difficult? Overcoming difficulties is the true color of heroes; we have lofty ideals, let the flowers of socialism bloom all over the plateau." The comfort mission representatives met their dearest people—PLA road construction soldiers and mainland laborers helping Tibetan people build a new life—in the border regions of the motherland. They held comfort rallies in the snow-capped mountains and dense forests where the various units were stationed, and reported on the achievements of the motherland's construction over the past four years. Currently, the comfort mission representatives are further delving into the companies to carry out comfort activities.

Another group of comfort mission representatives, led by Ren Jinglong and Ren Mingdao, Deputy Leaders of the Fourth Division of the Third General Sub-Delegation, arrived in a certain area of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province to comfort the road construction troops of the Chengdu-Aba Highway and the local garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Representatives of the General Delegation, the First General Sub-Delegation, the Fourth General Sub-Delegation, and the Second Division comforted the PLA coastal defense troops guarding the Changshan Islands. The comfort mission representatives braved raging waves and piercing sea winds for days to visit the garrison on each island.

In order to thank the PLA, the people of the Changshan Islands also sent representatives and folk dance troupes to participate in the comfort activities with the comfort mission representatives. Fishermen also entrusted the comfort mission representatives with the task of presenting the local famous seafood products such as sea cucumbers and dried scallops to Chairman Mao and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The in-depth comfort visits by the delegation representatives greatly encouraged the heroes of the coastal defense troops. On the 20th, the troops stationed on the Changshan Islands held a farewell meeting for the comfort mission representatives. The soldiers expressed their firm determination to defend the motherland and Chairman Mao.

Deputy General Leader of the Comfort Mission Tan Yubao and Deputy Leader of the Fifth General Sub-Delegation Li Bogang led a group of representatives to comfort the famous "Tashan Hero Regiment" guarding the South China Sea. When the soldiers saw the comfort mission representatives arriving in the rain from afar, they cheered "Long Live Chairman Mao," ran forward to greet them, and carried the representatives to the camp. During the comfort mission's visit to the "Tashan Hero Regiment," a grand comfort meeting was held, and groups were formed to go deep into the companies and hold discussions with the soldiers. Deputy General Leader Tan Yubao specially went to the "Tashan Defense Hero Company" and the famous "Li Guofu Squad" to present gifts to the heroic soldiers.

The comfort mission representatives' visit gave great encouragement to all commanders and fighters of the "Tashan Hero Regiment." Chen Shufu, the political commissar of the regiment, transferred the commemorative medals sent by friends from the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia to Tan Yubao and Huang Zaiyu, a second-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and others. The soldiers also presented their merit certificates, certificates of honor, and prizes obtained in cultural studies and military training to the representatives; and invited the representatives to visit the regiment's exhibition room of heroic deeds and live-fire tactical exercises. The soldiers of the "Li Guofu Squad" specially sent the target with twenty-two bullet holes they had shot through during the live-fire exercise to the representatives, asking them to present it to Chairman Mao. The target was also inscribed with: "If the enemy dares to invade our sacred territory, we will certainly annihilate them just like hitting this target."

The comfort mission representatives who visited various places also swept the tombs of PLA martyrs, martyrs' towers, and martyrs' monuments. Zhang Hanwen, Deputy Leader of the Sixth General Sub-Delegation, and representatives who visited the PLA troops in Yuci Special District, Shanxi Province, also went to Yunzhouxi Village in Wenshui County to sweep the tomb of Martyr Liu Hulan.

    据新华社讯：全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团的代表继续在各地深入慰问人民解放军。
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团总团、第一总分团（志愿军）和第三总分团的代表在副总团长栗再温率领下，到达康藏公路已成线的最前端，慰问筑路部队各部军工和工人。慰问团代表在十九日夜间到达某工段时，人民解放军战士都提着灯笼，手执火炬，站在新修好的公路两旁迎接他们。许多部队为慰问团代表赶修了宽敞的新房子。各部驻地帐篷门口，都张贴着“迎接亲人”的横额，决心修好公路的大幅对联和标语。有些对联上写着：“开山炮响、排山倒海、帝国主义心惊胆战！亲人来到、心花怒放、高原战士创建奇功！”“谁说康藏艰苦，有克服困难精神方是英雄本色；我们有崇高理想，让社会主义花朵开遍高原。”慰问团代表们在祖国边疆会见了自己最亲爱的人——人民解放军筑路军工和帮助藏族人民建设新生活的内地工人。他们在各部队驻地雪山下和密林中召开了慰问大会，并报告了四年来祖国建设的成就。现在，慰问团代表正进一步深入到各连队进行慰问活动。

    慰问团副总团长谭余保、第五总分团副团长李伯刚率领一部分代表，慰问了守卫着南海的、著名的“塔山英雄团”。当战士们远远望见慰问团代表冒雨赶来的时候，他们欢呼着“毛主席万岁”，跑步前来迎接，并把代表抬到营地。慰问团在“塔山英雄团”慰问期间，召开了盛大的慰问大会，并分组深入连队和战士们举行了座谈。谭余保副总团长特地到“塔山守备英雄连”和著名的“李国富班”向英雄战士们献礼。
    慰问团代表的慰问，给“塔山英雄团”全体指挥员、战斗员极大的鼓舞。该团政治委员陈树福把苏联、匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克等国的朋友所送的纪念章，转送给谭余保和中国人民志愿军二级英雄黄在渔等。战士们也把自己在文化学习和军事练兵中获得的立功奖状、光荣证和奖品送给代表；并请代表们参观了该团英雄事迹展览室和实弹战术演习。“李国富班”的战士特地把他们在实弹演习中打穿二十二个弹洞的人像靶送给代表，请代表转献给毛主席。靶上并写着：“如果敌人敢于侵犯我们神圣的领土，我们一定像命中这个靶一样地消灭它。”
