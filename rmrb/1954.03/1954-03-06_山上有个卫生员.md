    A Health Worker on the Mountain
    Wang Yu

    I
    At noon, the fishing team called, saying that a fisherman in the village was ill and asked the health worker to come down and take a look. Huang Longteng, under the orders of the instructor, quickly went down the mountain with his diagnostic tools.

    He entered a fisherman's house and saw an owner lying in bed. Although it was April, he was covered with a quilt and cotton-padded jacket, still shivering with cold, his face pale. Huang Longteng knew it was malaria. After testing the patient's temperature, he took out a packet of medicine and gave it to him. Huang Longteng stayed until the patient stopped shivering. The patient woke up and said gratefully, "Thank you, Big Brother Soldier." But the brows that had relaxed immediately furrowed again, as if he had something on his mind. Huang Longteng asked, "Owner, is there anything troubling you?" The patient shook his head and said after a while, "I want to ask, how much will it cost to treat my illness?" Huang Longteng knew that the troops had only arrived two days ago and the people did not know much about them, so he explained, "Owner, our People's Liberation Army serves the people, and treating the people's illnesses doesn't cost any money." Then, he asked, "Owner, what kind of medicine did you take for illnesses in the past? Were there any doctors to treat illnesses?" A bitter smile appeared on the corner of the patient's mouth, "Alas, comrade, don't mention the past!"

    The patient said, "This desolate island has never seen what a doctor looks like. Many people on the island get sick. No matter what the illness, they use a kind of wild grass to treat it. How can that work! I don't know how many people died of unknown illnesses without even knowing what was wrong with them. Although there are hospitals and pharmacies on the mainland, only landlords can go there to see a doctor. What chance do poor people have?"

    Huang Longteng understood the situation and felt that he had an added responsibility.

    He returned to the headquarters and told the instructor about the situation and his own opinions. The instructor agreed with his opinions and told him, "Uniting the fishermen on the island is an important task. You can use medical treatment to promote the policies of our Party and our army to the fishermen. As for the medicine..." Huang Longteng interrupted, "I think that as long as we do a good job in hygiene and epidemic prevention and reduce the number of patients, the remaining medicine will be enough. If it's not enough, we'll think of another way."

    After that, Huang Longteng often went with the fishing team to treat the fishermen. The fishermen became familiar with the troops and often came to him for help. No matter how heavy the rain, no matter how late the night, as long as someone came looking for him, he would go. Soon, everyone in the village knew that there was a health worker on the mountain.

    II

    One early morning, the fishermen gathered on the beach to help the army unload things. The instructor saw that the weather was clear and it was a good day for fishing, so he repeatedly urged the fishermen to go out to sea quickly; they refused, insisting on helping the army finish moving the things. Only one fisherman, an old man, quietly went out to sea to fish. Someone was calling him, but the old man didn't even turn his head.

    That night, the headquarters received a phone call saying that the old fisherman had become seriously ill. Huang Longteng, with a flashlight, quickly walked down the mountain. When he entered the old man's house, a woman was pacing anxiously in the room. Seeing Huang Longteng enter, she turned from worry to joy: "I'm troubling you again, Comrade Health Worker!" Huang Longteng walked to the bed and saw that the patient's breathing was very rapid, he was talking deliriously, and then he fainted. Huang Longteng asked when he had gotten sick. The woman replied, "He was fine when he went fishing in the morning. Around noon, he felt uncomfortable and came back. Alas! It's all his fault, not helping the army unload goods, but going out to sea..." Huang Longteng said, "Auntie, don't say that, let me take a look at him." After diagnosis, it was determined to be a severe case of pneumonia. He first performed emergency treatment, and the patient slowly woke up. Then he gave him an injection. This kind of disease needs an injection every four hours. Thus, he didn't get a good night's sleep. How many nights had Huang Longteng spent like this to treat the fishermen! After the patient recovered his health, Auntie gave Huang Longteng a basket of eggs, but Huang Longteng refused to accept them no matter what. Seeing that it was difficult to resolve the situation, the old man said, "If you don't accept them, then you don't accept them, that's the army's rule. In the past, I didn't help the army enough, but in the future, I will do my best to help the army defend the island and build the island, to repay Comrade Health Worker's life-saving grace." Huang Longteng quickly said, "It wasn't me who saved you, it was the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army."

    III

    In late autumn, the sun was still scorching hot. In order to strengthen the sea lookout work, the troops were rebuilding the lookout post. When the fishermen heard the news, they volunteered to help. They believed that this work was more important than fishing, because without the army frequently reporting weather and enemy situations, it would be very dangerous for ships to go out to sea.

    From the beach to the mountain, carrying wood, carrying bricks, one after another. Among them were young men, young women, and also old people and children. An old woman, over sixty years old, was carrying two bricks, although they weighed only ten pounds together, but beads of sweat were already appearing on her graying temples. The young men teased her, "Old Mama, go back and rest, we'll carry a couple more bricks and that'll be enough." The old woman was not convinced and said with a pout, "Never mind, what do you children know." She walked and rested, rested several times before reaching the mountain. The comrades hurriedly greeted her when they saw her and took the two bricks as if receiving a mother's caress. The old woman happily touched a comrade's shoulder and said, "Comrade, I've wanted to come and see you for a long time, but I was worried that the mountain was too high and I couldn't climb it. Today, while everyone is here working, I came up the mountain. But it wouldn't be good to come empty-handed, so I carried two bricks, I can't carry any more, don't laugh at me." After she finished speaking, she looked around for someone. Others asked her who she was looking for. She said, "Where's the health worker? Hasn't he returned from the meeting yet?" The soldiers replied, "He'll be back soon." The old woman was worried and said, "Don't tell me he's been transferred away, such a good child." Then she said, "The other day, I saw the child passing by the village with a backpack, and I thought he had been transferred away, so I quickly grabbed him and said to him: 'Don't go, if you leave, who will treat us when we get sick!'" She gesticulated as she spoke, and everyone around laughed.

    Everyone was resting, but they saw a fisherman still working diligently on the roof frame. Someone shouted, "Who is that so enthusiastic, come down and have some water!" The man turned his head, smiled, and it turned out to be the old man who had pneumonia. He wiped the sweat from his head with a towel and said, "Not tired, not thirsty." After saying that, he continued to work diligently. He had been working since morning and hadn't come down from the roof frame all morning.

    The people resting were talking about the health worker. This one said that the health worker had cured his malaria, that one said that the health worker had cured his injury... Yes, Huang Longteng had already treated more than eighty fishermen with serious illnesses. The fishermen missed the health worker and hoped that he would return soon. (Attached picture)

    No matter how heavy the rain, no matter how late the night, as long as someone comes to find Huang Longteng to treat an illness, he will go. Gu Shengyue Illustration

    山上有个卫生员
    王予
    一
    晌午，渔工组打来电话，说村里有一个渔民病了，叫卫生员下去看看。黄龙腾奉指导员的命令，带着诊断用具很快地下了山。
    他进了一家渔民的屋子，见一个老板躺在床上。虽是四月天气，他盖着棉被、棉袄，还冷得发抖，脸色刷白刷白的。黄龙腾知道是发了疟疾，试验了一下病人的体温以后，取出一包药给他吃了。黄龙腾一直守到病人不再发抖。病人清醒过来，感激地说：“谢谢大军同志。”但是他那舒展开来的眉头，马上又绉起来，好像有什么心事似的。黄龙腾问：“老板，您有什么困难吗？”病人摇了摇头，半天才说：“我想问，您治病要多少钱？”黄龙腾知道部队刚到两天，老百姓对我们还不大了解，就解释说：“老板，我们解放军是为老百姓服务的，给老百姓治病不要钱。”接着，他又问：“老板，你们过去患病都吃什么药，有医生治病吗？”病人的嘴角上浮现出一丝苦笑：“唉，同志，过去的日子别提了！”
    病人说：“这个荒岛，从来没见过医生是个什么样，岛上闹病的人很多，不管什么病，都用一种野草来治。这那行啊！不知道有多少人，也不知生什么病，就不明不白地死了。虽然大陆上有医院，有药铺，可是只有地主才能到那里去看病。又那有穷人的份呢？”
    黄龙腾知道了这个情况，感到自己又增加了一份责任。
    他回到指挥部里，把这个情况和他自己的意见，告诉了指导员。指导员同意他的意见，并告诉他：“在岛上团结渔民是个重要的工作，你可以通过治疗，多向渔民宣传我党我军的政策。至于药的问题……”黄龙腾接过来说：“我想只要我们搞好卫生防疫工作，减少了病员，那么剩下来的药是够用的，如果不够再另想办法。”
    此后，黄龙腾经常随渔工组给渔民治病，渔民和部队熟了，也经常找上门来请他。不管下多么大的雨，不管夜有多么深，只要有人找，他就去。不久以后，全村人都知道山上有个卫生员了。
    二
    一天清早，渔民们都聚集在沙滩上帮助军队卸东西。指导员看天气晴朗，正是打鱼的好天气，便几次劝渔民们快出海；他们不肯，一定要帮军队把东西搬完。只有一个渔民老翁的船悄悄地出海打鱼去了。有人在喊他，老翁连头也没有回。
    夜晚，指挥部接到电话，说那个渔民老翁得了急病。黄龙腾打着手电，疾速地走下山去。当他走进老翁的屋里时，一个女人在屋里正急得直打转。看见黄龙腾进来才转忧为喜：“又麻烦你了，卫生员同志！”黄龙腾走到床前，看那病人呼吸很急促，直说胡话，接着就昏迷了。黄龙腾问他什么时候病的，那女人答道：“上午打鱼时还好好的，傍晌午他感到不舒服，就回来了。唉！都怨他，不帮大军卸货，偏出海……”黄龙腾说：“翁大嫂，不要这样说，我给他看看。”经过诊断，判明是很严重的肺炎。他首先实行急救，病人才慢慢地苏醒过来。随后又打了一针。治这种病须隔四个钟头打一次针。这样，他便一夜没有睡好觉。为了给渔民治病，黄龙腾熬过多少这样的夜晚啊！病人恢复健康后，翁大嫂送给黄龙腾一篓鸡蛋，黄龙腾说什么也不收。老翁看这样子难以收场，就说：“不收就不收吧，那是大军的规矩。过去我对大军的帮助不够，今后一定尽力帮助大军保卫海岛，建设海岛，来报答卫生员同志的救命恩情。”黄龙腾忙说：“不是我救了你，是共产党、解放军。”
    三深秋季节，太阳还晒得烫人。为了加强海上的了望工作，部队正在改建了望台。渔民知道了这个消息，又主动来帮忙。他们认为这个工作比打鱼还重要，因为没有大军经常报告气象、敌情，船出海是很危险的。
    从沙滩到山上，扛木头的，挑砖的，一个接一个。这里面有小伙子、大姑娘，也有老人、小孩。有一个老妈妈六十多岁了，还挑着两块砖，虽然加在一起也不过十斤重，但是那花白的鬓角已经出现一串串的汗珠。小伙子们逗她：“老妈妈，快回去歇着吧，我们多挑两块就有了。”老妈妈不服气，鼓着嘴说：“你别管，小孩子懂得什么。”她，走一走歇一歇，歇了好几歇才到山上，同志们见了急忙迎上去。像接受母亲的抚爱一样地接过那两块砖。老妈妈高兴地摸着一个同志的肩膀说：“同志啊，我早就想来看看你们，就是顾虑山高上不来。今天趁大家都来干活，我才上山来。可是空手来不好看，就挑了两块砖，多了也挑不动，你们可别笑话。”她说完就四处寻找人。别人问她找谁，她说：“卫生员呢，他开会还没有回来吗？”战士们答道：“快啦。”老妈妈不放心，又说：“可别是调走了，多好的一个孩子。”接着她又说：“那天，我看见孩子背着背包，从乡里过，我心思他被调走了，忙上前抓住他，向他说：‘你可别走，走了我们再得了病，谁给治呀！’”她比比划划地说着，周围的人都笑起来。
    大家都在休息，只见房架上还有一个渔民叮叮当当地在干活。有人在喊：“那是谁那么积极呀，快下来喝点水吧！”那人转过头来，笑了笑，原来是患过肺炎的那个老翁啊。他用手巾擦去了头上的汗，说：“不累，也不渴。”说罢又叮叮当当地干开了。他从早晨干到这时候，一上午也没下房架。
    休息的人们正在谈着卫生员。这个说卫生员给他治好了疟疾，那个说卫生员给他治好了跌伤……是的，经黄龙腾治好的重病的渔民，已有八十多人了。渔民们怀念着卫生员，盼望他快些回来。（附图片）
