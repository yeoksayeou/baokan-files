    Pingxiang Mining Bureau Laboratory Neglects Coking Coal Testing Work
    Rong Keqin of the Technical Department of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau writes: During the period of large-scale economic construction in our motherland, coking coal, the main "grain" of the metallurgical industry, is urgently needed. To this end, the state has invested a large amount of funds to find coking coal resources and carry out sampling, testing, and other work. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau is one of the units undertaking this glorious task of coal sample testing.
    This time, there is an important and urgent coal sample testing task. Experts from steel, geological, mechanical, and coal mine design departments are waiting for this information to be translated into Russian within the scheduled time and sent to the Soviet Union for design. However, the leading cadres of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau Laboratory do not pay attention to this work. In order to speed up the drying speed of coal samples after float-sink separation, it is necessary to add an electric furnace (actually two fuses and an iron plate); however, the leading cadres of the laboratory delayed the solution for more than ten days. Later, not only was a new electric furnace not added, but even the original one was broken, and the laboratory did not repair it in time. As a result, they had to use charcoal to dry the coal samples after float-sink separation. Because charcoal ash is easy to scatter on the coal samples, many coal samples react incorrectly. The staff of the laboratory directly put solid zinc chloride into the specific gravity bucket, so the zinc chloride could not dissolve and precipitate in a short period of time, which affected the accuracy of the specific gravity. We suggest that the mother liquor or a higher specific gravity liquid should be prepared first, and then added to the specific gravity bucket to prevent the above-mentioned adverse phenomena; however, this simple and easy method has not been adopted. Most of the ash furnaces in the laboratory do not have high-temperature electric meters, and they do not know what temperature the ash is burned at, which affects the ash burning efficiency. The same is true for volatile powder furnaces and drying ovens. When the temperature is high, the furnace door is opened, and when the temperature is low, it is closed. Sometimes, no one is in charge of the furnace at all.
    The Central South Coal Mine Administration Bureau is the direct leadership organ of the mine. However, they are also very irresponsible for this major task. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau allocated a batch of capital construction investment to the Central South Coal Mine Administration Bureau, specifying that it should add experimental equipment for coking coal mines. However, they detained the funds without obtaining the consent of the General Administration and without considering the actual situation. Later, although a small number of instruments were purchased, they were stockpiled in the warehouse, while the coking coal sample testing work in Pingxiang and other places could not be carried out well due to insufficient instruments.

### 萍乡矿务局化验室忽视炼焦煤试验工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    萍乡矿务局化验室忽视炼焦煤试验工作
    煤矿管理总局技术处戎克勤来信：在祖国大规模经济建设时期，冶金工业的主要粮食——炼焦煤是我们所迫切需要的。为此，国家投了大批资金来寻找炼焦煤的资源，进行采样、化验等工作。萍乡矿务局正是担负着这个光荣的煤样试验任务的单位之一。
    这次有一项重要而紧急的煤样化验任务，钢铁部门、地质部门、机械部门、煤矿设计部门等专家，都在等待着这些资料，要在预定期间内翻译成俄文，寄往苏联设计去。但是，萍乡矿务局化验室领导干部却不重视这个工作。为了加快煤样浮沉后的干燥速度，需要增添一个电炉子（实际上是二个保险丝和一块铁板）；该室的领导干部却整整拖延了十余天不给解决。后来，不但新的电炉子没有增加，连原有的一个都坏了，该室也不及时修理，结果只好用木炭烧火来烘干浮沉后的煤样。因为木炭灰容易飞散在煤样上，以致许多煤样反应不正确。该室工作人员用固体氯化锌直接投入比重桶内，因而氯化锌在短期内不能溶化而沉淀，这就影响到比重的正确性。我们建议先配好母液或者是高些的比重液，再向比重桶里掺，以防止上述不良现象；可是这一简单易行的方法并未被采纳。该室绝大部分灰分炉都没有高温电表计，烧灰时不知道是在什么样的温度下来进行的，影响烧灰效率。挥发粉炉、烘水干燥箱等也是这样，温度高时打开炉门，温度低时就关上，有时根本没有人在炉子旁边掌管。
    中南煤矿管理局是该矿的直属领导机关。但他们对这一重大任务也很不负责任。去年第四季，煤矿管理总局曾拨给中南煤矿管理局一批基本建设投资，指明要增添炼焦煤矿的试验设备。但他们既未征得总局同意，又不考虑实际情况，就把这笔款扣留起来。后来虽然也买了少部分仪器，但却积压在仓库里，而萍乡等地的炼焦煤样试验工作，却因仪器不足而不能很好开展。
