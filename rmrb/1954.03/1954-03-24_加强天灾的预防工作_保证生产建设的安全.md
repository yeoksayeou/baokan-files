The State Council of the Central People's Government has issued "Instructions on Strengthening the Forecasting, Warning, and Prevention of Disastrous Weather," which makes clear provisions for the forecasting and warning of disastrous weather, the release and transmission of warnings, and the organization of disaster prevention work. This is a very important measure regarding disaster prevention work.

In the long course of history, the Chinese people have long been helpless and defenseless against natural disasters, suffering from various disasters caused by gales, heavy rains, and frosts. The reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties regarded the lives of the people as worthless, not only did they not care about the disasters caused to the people, but they also used so-called disaster relief work as a means of exploitation, let alone using scientific achievements to prevent natural disasters.

The most important weather changes that can cause disasters in our country are typhoons and cold waves. From mid-April to mid-November each year is the typhoon season, during which typhoons generated in the Pacific or South China Sea may often invade the southeastern coastal areas of our country. The disasters caused by typhoons are mainly due to the gales, heavy rains, and huge waves and tides brought by typhoons. The wind force near the center of a typhoon often exceeds level 12 (wind speed of more than 30 meters per second), the maximum rainfall brought by a typhoon can reach 500 millimeters in one day, the sea surface can suddenly rise by 20 to 30 feet, and the wave height can reach four or five yards. The result of these huge destructive forces attacking simultaneously is that sea walls are destroyed, houses collapse, farmland is flooded, and ships at sea are often wrecked or sunk because they cannot escape in time. In Chinese history, there was a tragic fact that 60,000 people died in a single typhoon disaster (Shantou area in 1922). Although the destructive power of cold waves is not as great as that of typhoons, the large cold waves that move southward from Europe and northern Asia from late autumn to spring each year often sweep across the entire territory of our country, affecting a larger area than typhoons. The gales and severe cold brought by cold waves often cause wind, frost, and freezing disasters in large areas, greatly reducing or completely eliminating crop yields; they also pose a serious threat to smaller ships navigating in rivers and seas. In addition to typhoons and cold waves, other localized severe weather conditions such as heavy rain and hail also cause disasters. Although the scope is small, the losses caused by them cannot be ignored.

In recent years, thanks to the attention of governments at all levels and the efforts of wind and flood prevention organizations and meteorological staff, warnings of cold waves and large-scale storms have generally been issued in a timely manner; frost prevention work in rural areas has also been initially carried out; at the same time, coastal fishing port storm warning stations have also been established to ensure the safety of fishermen's operations. Typhoon warnings have been supported by the vast masses in the southeastern coastal areas, and the number of typhoon disaster losses is gradually decreasing; disaster prevention work has achieved certain results. However, the natural disasters suffered by industries such as mining, transportation, agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, and salt are still quite serious. On the one hand, this is due to the limitations of current production equipment conditions, and it is impossible to completely avoid losses when the destructive power of wind and rain is too great; on the other hand, it is also because our forecasting, warning, and prevention work still has some shortcomings, which requires us to greatly improve in this regard.

Disaster prevention is a meticulous and complex task. The first step in this work is for meteorological observatories to issue warnings of disastrous weather in advance. Meteorological science is a young science. Meteorology is mainly based on the analysis of the nature of collected data and information, applying theories that are not yet fully mature, and cannot truly use precise mathematical calculations. Many basic principles, such as atmospheric circulation and energy conversion in the atmosphere, have not been completely resolved. Therefore, meteorological science needs a large and wide-ranging monitoring and reporting network to provide information in a timely and frequent manner, and it needs a large amount of historical data with long periods and high accuracy to find the evolution law of our country's weather systems. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there were only a few meteorological observatories and stations that served the invasion agencies, and there was no way to accumulate correct data or grasp the laws of change. After the liberation of the whole country, my country's meteorological work has made great progress. Facts in recent years have proved that, through the efforts of all meteorological staff, the central and local meteorological observatories have been able to make accurate forecasts and issue warnings about 24 to 48 hours before the invasion of large-scale disastrous weather such as typhoons and cold waves. However, due to the lack of any original foundation, the history of our meteorological observatory construction is not long, the accumulated records and data are limited, and the number of meteorological observatories that can make forecasts is still not enough. There are still many problems to be solved in the analysis and forecasting technology. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to create conditions to improve the accuracy of forecasts and extend the validity period of forecasts. The instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government require that "the existing Central Meteorological Observatory, regional meteorological observatories, and local meteorological forecasting observatories and stations must strive to be rapid and accurate in forecasting and warning of disastrous weather such as typhoons, cold waves, and the accompanying large-scale storms (snow) and frosts. Attention should be paid to the specific and clear areas and times when disasters may occur. If there are new changes in the weather situation after the forecast and warning are issued, corrections or supplements should be issued in a timely manner." All meteorological workers across the country should redouble their efforts to achieve this glorious and important task. Weather forecasters should actively study the advanced meteorological science theories of the Soviet Union, constantly summarize work experience, further master the evolution laws of our country's weather systems, improve the level of weather analysis and forecasting technology, and report disastrous weather more accurately, more specifically, and earlier. Meteorological observatories and stations scattered throughout the country, especially in remote areas, should further recognize the importance of their work, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, overcome the lack of material conditions and other difficulties, and provide information and data more widely, more quickly, and more accurately to ensure the timely release of forecasts and warnings.

Making accurate forecasts and issuing warnings in a timely manner are only the first steps in the fight against natural disasters. It is also necessary to quickly transmit the forecasts and warnings, widely mobilize manpower and materials, and do a good job in prevention and rescue work to give full play to the role of forecasts and warnings. The instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government pointed out that: local people's broadcasting stations and coastal radio stations should broadcast disastrous weather forecasts and warnings on a regular basis, and should temporarily increase the number of broadcasts when necessary; local newspapers should also publish forecasts and warnings of disastrous weather in the region or locally in a prominent position in a timely manner; and "relevant departments of governments at all levels, especially relevant business agencies, should establish a system and method for transmitting forecasts and warnings of large-scale disastrous weather, and after receiving these forecasts and warnings, immediately use wired and wireless radio communication equipment and other communication tools of departments such as the Telecommunications Bureau to widely transmit them without delay or backlog." These instructions are very important, and governments at all levels and relevant departments need to overcome difficulties, study specific and feasible methods, and ensure their implementation based on existing conditions. Weather disasters not only affect large cities with good transportation and communication conditions, but more seriously affect vast areas with poor equipment and weak defense forces, especially agriculture, fishery, animal husbandry, salt, and other industries with individual operations, decentralized production, and insufficient technical equipment conditions. Therefore, difficulties in transmission and prevention must be overcome, and the transmission of disastrous weather warnings must be rapid and accurate, widespread, and not chaotic. In some areas, relevant departments have experienced the phenomenon of accumulating warnings due to the unsound duty system or their own subjective and narrow experience of weather changes, which must be thoroughly corrected. Preventive measures and rescue work must go deep into the masses, mobilizing and organizing manpower and materials based on specific protection objects and conditions. Relevant leading cadres should pay attention to combining scientific principles and absorbing the experience of the masses, not blindly exaggerating, not being paralyzed and careless, and correctly arranging work. Relevant departments should strengthen contact and cooperation with meteorological departments at all levels to make disaster prevention work truly effective.

The production and construction of industry and mining, transportation, and farmland water conservancy in our country are increasing year by year. On the one hand, due to the improvement of conditions, the modernization of equipment, and the organization of individual small producers, the ability to resist natural disasters has been greatly enhanced; but on the other hand, precisely because the scale of construction and production has increased, if effective preventive measures are not taken, the losses from disasters may be even greater. Therefore, doing a good job in the forecasting, warning, and prevention of disastrous weather will better ensure the normal progress of industrial and mining production, the smooth flow of transportation, the bumper harvest of grain and cash crops, and the protection of agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction from damage; it can prevent and reduce the loss of people's lives and property and state property.

    加强天灾的预防工作  保证生产建设的安全
    中央人民政府政务院发布了“关于加强灾害性天气的预报、警报和预防工作的指示”，对灾害性天气的预报、警报的发布和传递，以及灾害预防工作的组织等，都作了明确的规定。这是关于天灾预防工作的很重要的措施。
    在过去悠长的历史中，我国人民长期处在对天灾束手无策、毫无防御的状态中，饱受狂风、暴雨、霜冻所造成的各种灾害。历代反动统治阶级视人民的生命如草芥，不但不关心天灾对人民的祸害，而且利用所谓救灾工作作为榨取的手段，更谈不上运用科学成果来防御天灾了。
    在我国出现的足以造成灾害的天气变化，最主要的是台风和寒潮。每年四月中旬至十一月中旬为台风季节，在此期间，太平洋或南海上生成的台风常常可能侵袭我国东南沿海地区。台风的灾害，主要是由于台风带来的狂风、暴雨和巨浪高潮造成的。台风中心附近风力常超过十二级（风速每秒三十公尺以上），台风所带来的暴雨最大的雨量一天之内可达五百公厘，海面可骤然上涨二三十尺，浪高可达四、五丈。这几种巨大的破坏力同时袭击的结果，使得海堤冲毁，房屋倒塌，农田被淹，海上船只常常因为躲避不及而被打烂或者打沉。我国历史上曾有过在一次台灾（一九二二年汕头地区）中死亡六万人的惨痛事实。寒潮破坏力虽然不如台风，但每年秋末到春季从欧洲和亚洲北部南下的大寒潮，往往可横扫我国全境，影响范围比台风还大。寒潮所带来的大风和严寒常常造成大片地区的风灾、霜灾和冻灾，使农作物大为减产或者完全没有收成；对江海中航行的较小船只也造成严重的威胁。除台风、寒潮而外，其他局部性的恶劣天气如暴雨、冰雹等所造成的灾害，范围虽然较小，但由它们所造成的损失，也是不容忽视的。
    几年来，由于各级人民政府的重视和防风、防汛组织以及气象工作人员的努力，对寒潮及较大范围的暴风一般已能及时发布警报；农村的防霜工作也得到了初步的开展；同时为保障渔民作业安全的沿海渔港暴风警报站也大都建立起来。台风警报已获得东南沿海广大群众的拥护，台灾损失数字正逐步减少；防御天灾的工作已经取得了一定的成绩。但工矿、交通运输、农、牧、渔、盐等业中所遭受的自然灾害仍然相当严重。这一方面固然是由于目前生产设备条件的限制，在风雨破坏力过大时，无法完全避免损失；另一方面也由于我们的预报、警报和预防工作还有一些缺点，这就需要我们从这方面大大地提高一步。
    防御天灾是一项细致而复杂的工作。此项工作的第一个环节就是气象台对灾害性的天气预先发出警报。气象科学是一门年青的科学，对气象主要还是从搜集到的资料情报中，应用尚未完全成熟的理论作性质上的分析，还不能真正使用精密的数理计算。很多基本原理如大气环流，大气中能量的转换等问题尚未完全解决。所以气象科学需要密度大、范围广的庞大测报网，以便及时地、频繁地供给情报，并且需要年代长、准确性高的大量历史资料以找寻我国天气系统的演变规律。国民党反动派统治时代只有少数为侵略机构服务的气象台、站，根本谈不上积累正确资料，掌握变化规律。全国解放后我国气象工作有了很大的发展。几年来的事实证明，经过全体气象工作人员的努力，中央和各地气象台已经大体上能在台风和寒潮等大范围的灾害性天气侵袭前二十四至四十八小时之中作出准确的预报，发布警报。但是，由于原来没有什么基础，我们建设气象台的历史不长，累积的记录资料有限，能作预报的气象台数量仍不够多，分析预报技术方面还有许多问题有待进一步解决。所以，我们还必须继续努力创造条件，以提高预报的准确性和延长预报的时效。中央人民政府政务院的指示，要求“现有中央气象台、各区气象台以及各地气象预报台、站，对于台风、寒潮和随之而来的大范围的暴风雨（雪）和霜冻等灾害性天气的预报、警报，必须力求迅速、准确，对于灾害可能发生的地区和时间，应注意具体、明确，如预报、警报发出后，天气形势有了新的变化，并应及时发出修正或补充”。全国气象工作人员应加倍努力实现这一项光荣而重大的任务。天气预报员应积极学习苏联先进气象科学理论，经常总结工作经验，更进一步掌握我国天气系统的演变规律，提高天气分析和预报技术的水平，更准确地、更具体地、更先期地报出灾害性的天气。分散在全国各地，尤其是边远地区的气象台和气象站的工作人员应当进一步认识本身工作的重要性，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，克服物质条件缺乏及其他的困难，更广泛地、更迅速地、更准确地供给情报资料，保证预报、警报的及时发布。
    作出准确的预报，及时地发布警报，只是和天灾作斗争的第一步，还须将预报、警报迅速地传达下去，广泛动员人力、物力，作好预防和抢救工作，才能发挥预报、警报的作用。中央人民政府政务院指示中指出：各地人民广播电台和海岸电台应定时广播灾害性的天气预报、警报，必要时并应临时增加广播次数；各地报纸对于本区或当地灾害性天气的预报、警报也应及时地以显著地位刊登；而“各级政府有关部门特别是各有关业务机关，应建立传递大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报的制度和办法，并在接到是项预报、警报后，立即运用电信局等部门有线、无线电通信设备及其他各种通讯工具广泛传达，不得拖延积压”。这些指示，都是非常重要的，需要各级政府及有关部门，根据现有条件，克服困难，研究出具体可行的办法，保证贯彻实施。天气灾害不但影响交通通信条件好的大城市，更严重的是影响设备差、防御力量薄弱的广大地区，特别是个体经营、生产分散、技术设备条件还不够的农、渔、牧、盐等业地区，所以对传递和预防上的困难，必须努力加以克服，灾害性天气警报的传递必须做到迅速而不错误，广泛而不混乱。某些地区有关部门曾经发生过因值班制度不严密或因自己对于天气变化的主观狭隘经验而积压警报的现象，必须加以彻底改正。预防措施及抢救工作必须深入群众，根据具体防护对象和情况，动员和组织人力、物力。有关领导干部则应注意结合科学道理，吸取群众经验，不盲目夸大，不麻痹大意，正确布置工作。各有关部门应和各级气象部门加强联系、配合，使防灾工作做到确实有效。
    我国工矿、交通运输、农田水利的生产和建设正在逐年增大，一方面因条件的改善，设备的近代化，个体小生产者已组织起来，抵抗天灾的能力大为增强；但另一方面，正因为建设和生产的规模增大，如不采取有效的防御措施，所受到灾害的损失可能也更为增大。所以，做好灾害性天气的预报、警报和预防工作，就能更好地保证工矿生产正常进行，交通运输畅通，粮食和经济作物丰收，农林水利建设不受破坏；就可防止和减轻人民生命财产和国家资财的损失。
