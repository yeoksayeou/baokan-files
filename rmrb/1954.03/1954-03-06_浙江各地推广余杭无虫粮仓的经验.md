Zhejiang's local grain departments are actively promoting the advanced experience of Yuhang County grain departments in creating insect-free granaries.

Since studying the Party's general line for the transition period, the staff of Zhejiang's grain departments have gained a new understanding of the importance of their work and have expressed their desire to reduce grain losses to support national economic construction. Many staff members of grain bureaus and granaries have studied Yuhang County's advanced experience in grain storage and have drawn up plans for creating insect-free granaries this year. According to incomplete statistics, the insect-free granaries planned to be created in various parts of the province can hold more than 330 million jin of grain.

In order to implement the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than cure," local grain departments have carried out warehouse cleaning and disinfection work. The Shaoxing County Grain Bureau originally planned to end the warehouse cleaning and disinfection work in early November last year. In order to further eliminate pests, it convened a meeting of technical custodians of grain depots in various districts to arrange for re-cleaning of the warehouses. In the nine district grain depots, more than 77,000 jin of garbage, more than 2,300 jin of insect corpses and cocoons, more than 1,400 dan of broken tiles and bricks were swept out, and more than 4,500 jin of green grass was removed. The bureau plans to make 50 percent of the county's granaries insect-free granaries this year. Some cadres of Changshan County grain depots originally had the idea that "only medicine can cure pests, and cleaning and sweeping is useless." After learning from Yuhang County's experience in grain storage, they realized that thorough cleaning and disinfection is the basic key to pest control and immediately actively invested in warehouse cleaning and disinfection work. The whole county strives to create 70 percent of insect-free granaries this year. Grain keepers in Lanxi and other counties have also improved their working methods. By the end of last year, more than 80 percent of the grain empty warehouses in the province had been cleaned and disinfected, totaling about 50,000 dan of garbage and more than 117,000 jin of insect cocoons and corpses.

However, a few grain departments still encountered some ideological obstacles when promoting Yuhang County's advanced experience in grain storage. For example, some people believe that insects are so small, grain is so much, and warehouse conditions are so poor that it is impossible to completely eliminate pests. Some people only carry out blitz cleaning and disinfection work and do not pay attention to regular cleaning and hygiene. These shortcomings should be corrected.

### 浙江各地推广余杭无虫粮仓的经验

    浙江各地推广余杭无虫粮仓的经验
    浙江省各地粮食部门正积极推广余杭县粮食部门创造无虫粮仓的先进经验。
    浙江省粮食部门的职工，自从学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线以后，对自己工作的重要性有了新的认识，纷纷表示要减少粮食的损失，以支援国家经济建设。很多粮食局、粮库的职工，学习了余杭县保管粮食的先进经验，订出了今年创造无虫粮仓的计划。据不完全统计，该省各地计划创造的无虫粮仓，可容纳三亿三千余万斤粮食。
    为了贯彻“防重于治”的粮食保管方针，各地粮食部门开展了清仓消毒工作。绍兴县粮食局本来准备在去年十一月上旬结束清仓消毒工作，为了进一步消除害虫，又召开了各区粮库技术保管员会议，布置重新清仓，在九个区的粮库清扫出垃圾七万七千余斤，虫尸、虫茧二千三百余斤，碎瓦、破砖一千四百多担，拔除青草四千五百余斤。该局计划在今年使全县百分之五十的粮仓成为无虫粮仓。常山县部分粮库干部原来有“害虫唯有药品能治，清仓打扫无用”的思想，经学习余杭县保管粮食的经验后，认识到彻底清仓消毒是防治虫害的基本关键，立即积极投入清仓消毒工作，全县争取今年创造百分之七十的无虫粮仓。兰溪等县的粮食保管员也改进了工作方法。到去年年底，全省已经打扫、消毒的粮食空仓即达百分之八十以上，计清理出垃圾五万担左右，虫茧、虫尸十一万七千余斤。
    但仍有少数粮食部门在推广余杭县保管粮食的先进经验时，遇到了一些思想障碍。如有的人认为虫子这样小，粮食这样多，仓库条件这样差，不可能完全消除虫害。还有的只是进行突击性的清仓消毒工作，不注意经常性的清洁卫生。这些缺点应注意纠正。
