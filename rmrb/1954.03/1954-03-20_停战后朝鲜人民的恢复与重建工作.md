    Post-Armistice Recovery and Reconstruction Work of the Korean People
    Zhou Meisheng
    The heroic Korean people, who defeated the American aggressors, immediately launched into the arduous task of healing the wounds of war and rebuilding the national economy after the armistice. The liberated Korean people, under the leadership and encouragement of the Korean Workers' Party, not only demonstrated unparalleled heroism in the struggle to win the freedom and independence of their motherland and oppose imperialist aggression, but also displayed patriotic labor enthusiasm in peaceful construction.
    In the first few years after the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, great achievements were made in consolidating the people's democratic system and developing the national economy. Industrial output in 1949 increased fourfold compared to 1946. In rural areas, since the implementation of land reform, the sown area has increased by nearly 25 percent, and the yield per unit area of all kinds of crops has greatly increased. The war of aggression launched by American imperialism and its South Korean Syngman Rhee clique in June 1950 interrupted the peaceful construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The inhumane American aggressors destroyed the peaceful cities and villages of North Korea and demolished its industry and agriculture in the three-year war. However, the brutal crimes of the American aggressors could not destroy the firm will of the Korean people. The Korean people defeated American aggression and stood up even more heroically.
    After the Korean armistice, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government immediately led the people to start the work of restoring the national economy and began to formulate plans for the reconstruction of Korea. At the Sixth Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party held from August 5th to 9th, 1953, Comrade Kim Il-sung put forward the far-reaching steps for restoring, rebuilding, and developing the national economy: "In restoring and developing our people's economy, first, we must carry out comprehensive preparation and arrangement work needed to restore and develop the people's economy in half a year or even a year; secondly, we must formulate a three-year plan to restore and develop the people's economy, so that all sectors of the people's economy can reach the pre-war level; in the third stage, we must formulate and implement a five-year plan to develop the entire industry of the country, so that our country can develop into a prosperous, democratic, and independent country." Comrade Kim Il-sung called on all party members and the masses to mobilize "everything to strengthen the democratic base and restore and develop the post-war people's economy."
    The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea responded to the great call of the Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and set off a great upsurge in restoring and rebuilding the people's economy. With the great assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and fraternal countries, they quickly achieved significant results. They completed the preparatory work for economic recovery within five months after the armistice and began to implement the three-year plan for restoring and developing the people's economy from January this year.
    In terms of industry, the speed of recovery is very fast. All factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry had been repaired and put into production by the end of 1953. On the 55th day after the armistice, the No. 2 electric furnace of the Kangson Steel Plant was repaired 40 days ahead of schedule, and the first batch of products in the country after the war was produced. The Chongjin Steel Plant also held a steel production ceremony on September 25th last year. Coal production has increased to twice the pre-war period, and the production of various mineral sands is also constantly increasing, and electricity supply is rapidly recovering. In addition, the Pyongyang Textile Factory, the Hungnam Mineral Fertilizer Factory, and the Sunghori Cement Factory have been partially repaired and put into production last year. In order to meet the urgent needs of basic construction projects, two new pottery factories were built. These two factories (the Taesong Pottery Factory in Pyongyang and the Kangnam Pottery Factory in Kangnam County, South Pyongan Province) were completed and put into production in November last year, with an annual output of 100 million bricks per factory.
    The rapid recovery of transportation in North Korea after the armistice played a significant role in promoting various recovery and construction efforts. During the war, 50 percent of the railways and more than 3,900 bridges were destroyed by enemy aircraft. However, on the ninth day after the armistice (August 5th, 1953), the railway workers of North Korea repaired the main railway lines centered on Pyongyang and reaching Sinuiju, Kaesong, Manpo, Wonsan, and Najin, and opened passenger trains. On October 25th last year, the first phase of the railway restoration and improvement project was completed, and the main railways in North Korea were open to traffic.
    Farmers in North Korea bravely persisted in production during the war, despite enemy bombing and destruction, and supported the war against American aggression. After the armistice, farmers in North Korea actively carried out agricultural recovery work. They first worked hard to restore farmland near the front lines and coastal areas, filling in bomb craters and shell holes, vigorously repairing reservoirs, and expanding and building new irrigation projects. It is expected that farmland will be basically restored before this year's spring plowing. At present, farmers in North Korea are vigorously preparing for spring plowing and production, and they plan to increase grain production by 20 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. They are confident that within one or two years, agricultural production will not only reach but also exceed the pre-war level.
    The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have shown great concern for stabilizing and improving the people's lives after the war. With the rapid progress of the recovery and construction work and the massive assistance from fraternal countries, the lives of the broad masses of people in the north have also been improved. After the armistice, the government provided large amounts of loans to workers, farmers, and families of servicemen to build houses and engage in production. People who lived in caves during the war moved into newly built houses. By January this year, more than 15,000 houses, more than 120 office buildings, more than 80 factories, and more than 130 warehouses have been newly built in Pyongyang. Workers and staff in various places received large amounts of winter supplies such as coal, cotton cloth, cotton clothes, and food distributed by the government last year. Farmers in various places also received cotton cloth distributed by the government. The government's commercial departments reduced the prices of daily necessities three times in March, July, and December 1953, and the prices of dozens of items were reduced by more than 50 percent. Market prices also decreased accordingly, and the purchasing power of the working people increased significantly.
    On the basis of the initial achievements in restoring the national economy, the Korean people have confidently started to implement the three-year plan for post-war recovery and development of the people's economy since this year. The heroic Korean people are convinced that in the near future they will be able to fully restore the people's economy, which was severely damaged by the war, to the pre-war level and further develop it.
    The biggest feature of Korea's economic recovery and development is to restore existing factories and build new factories on a new technological basis, in order to fundamentally change the deformed state of Korean industry caused by Japanese colonial rule and make Korea a country with its own independent industry. With the great material and technical assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and people's democratic countries, Korea will build dozens of factories that have never existed before. In the near future, Korea's machinery industry will be able to produce its own machine tools, prime movers, auto parts, pumps, motors, transformers, etc. The first automobile factory, which is under construction, will be able to produce 6,000 cars per year by 1957.
    Korean cities will also be rapidly rebuilt. The Korean Cabinet has formulated a grand plan for the restoration and reconstruction of major cities in the north. According to this plan, the cities in North Korea will be built into modern, civilized cities and become new-style cities that are compatible with the country's industrial development and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural life. Now, the working people in Pyongyang, Wonsan, Chongjin, Hamhung, Hungnam, Sinuiju, and Sariwon are carrying out the huge work of recovery and reconstruction with great enthusiasm and speed.
    Korea's recovery and reconstruction work is arduous. However, the Korean people have all the conditions to successfully complete this glorious task. The Korean people have the correct leadership of the Workers' Party and the government headed by Marshal Kim Il-sung. The Korean Workers' Party has become a strong inspirer and organizer for the Korean people to overcome all difficulties, carry out peaceful construction, safeguard independence and freedom, and restore national unity. The Korean people, who have withstood the severe test of defeating the American aggressors, are uniting around their close party with a hundredfold confidence and enthusiasm to create a new life. The heroic and conscious Korean people possess the noble quality of diligently building their own country. Their peaceful construction work has abundant resources, and the iron, non-ferrous metals, timber, coal, electricity, and other industrial raw materials needed to restore and develop the people's economy are inexhaustible. In the recovery and reconstruction, the Korean people have received huge and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and people's democratic countries. The governments and people of the democratic camp regard Korea's recovery and reconstruction work as a task closely related to their own. The Soviet government has decided to donate 1 billion rubles of materials to the Korean people. Our country signed the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement and donated 8 trillion yuan of materials to the Korean people. People's democratic countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania have also provided huge assistance. Fraternal countries have also sent experts and technicians to Korea to help the Korean people restore and build their country. The Chinese People's Volunteers, who fought alongside the Korean people in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, also actively participated in the recovery and reconstruction work in Korea after the armistice and helped the Korean people rebuild their homes. The huge material and technical assistance from fraternal countries has alleviated many difficulties for the Korean people in healing the wounds of war and has promoted the rapid progress of Korea's recovery and reconstruction work.
    The victorious progress of the recovery and reconstruction work in North Korea is of great significance. Rapidly restoring and developing the people's economy destroyed by the war, stabilizing the people's lives, and firmly establishing the economic foundation of national industrialization are reliable guarantees for safeguarding the fruits of victory and seeking peaceful reunification of the country. The achievements of the Korean people in peaceful construction help to enhance the strength of the entire peace and democracy camp and the people of the world in defending peace.

    停战后朝鲜人民的恢复与重建工作周梅生
    战胜了美国侵略者的英雄的朝鲜人民，在停战后立即展开了医治战争创伤、重建国民经济的艰巨工作。解放了的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党的领导与鼓舞下，不仅在争取祖国的自由独立、反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中表现了无比的英雄气概，而且在和平建设中也显示了爱国主义的劳动热忱。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立后的最初几年中，曾在巩固人民民主制度和发展国民经济方面取得了巨大的成就。工业产量在一九四九年较一九四六年增加四倍。在农村，自从实行了土地改革以后，播种面积就差不多增加了百分之二十五，所有各种农作物的单位面积产量都大大地增加了。一九五零年六月，美帝国主义和它指使下的南朝鲜李承晚匪帮发动的侵略战争，打断了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的和平建设工作。绝灭人性的美国侵略者在三年战争中破坏了北朝鲜的和平城市与乡村，摧毁了它的工业和农业。但是，美国侵略者的残暴罪行并不能摧毁朝鲜人民的坚强意志，朝鲜人民击败了美国的侵略，并更加英勇地站起来了。
    朝鲜停战后，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府立刻领导人民着手恢复国民经济的工作，并开始拟定重建朝鲜的计划。在一九五三年八月五日到九日举行的朝鲜劳动党六中全会上，金日成同志提出了恢复、重建和发展国民经济的远大步骤：“在恢复和发展我们的人民经济中，首先要在半年乃至一年期间展开恢复并发展人民经济上所需要的全面性的准备和整理工作；其次要制订恢复并发展人民经济的三年计划，使人民经济的各部门能够达到战前的水平；在第三阶段要制订发展国家整个工业的五年计划，并加以实现，以使我们的国家发展成为富强的、民主的独立国家。”金日成同志号召全体党员和人民群众动员起来，“一切为了加强民主基地，恢复和发展战后人民经济。”
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民群众响应了劳动党和金日成元帅的伟大号召，掀起了恢复和重建人民经济的巨大热潮，在苏联、中国和各兄弟国家的巨大援助下，迅速地取得了重大的成就。他们在停战后的五个月内便完成了恢复经济的准备工作，并从今年一月起开始执行恢复和发展人民经济的三年计划。
    在工业方面，恢复的速度是很快的。重工业省所属的全部工厂在一九五三年底都已修复并开工生产。在停战后的第五十五天，降仙钢铁工厂的第二号电气炉便提前四十天修复，炼出了战后全国的第一批产品。城津炼钢厂也在去年九月二十五日举行了出钢仪式。煤的产量增加到战前时期的两倍，各种矿砂的产量也在不断增加，电力供应迅速地恢复了。此外，平壤纺织工厂、兴南矿质肥料工厂和胜湖里水泥工厂等都已于去年部分修复并开始生产。为了供应基本建设工程的迫切需要，特新建了两所窑业工厂，这两个厂（平壤市的大成窑业工厂和平安南道江南郡的江南窑业工厂）都已于去年十一月竣工并开始生产，每厂年产砖一万万块。
    停战后朝鲜北部交通运输事业的迅速恢复，对于推进各项恢复与建设工作起了重大的作用。在战时，百分之五十的铁道和三千九百多座桥梁被敌机炸毁。但是，停战后的第九天（一九五三年八月五日），朝鲜铁道职工便修复了以平壤为中心的通达新义州、开城、满浦、元山、罗津等地的主要铁道干线，并开动了旅客列车。去年十月二十五日，铁路的第一期复旧和改善工程便全部完成，朝鲜北部的主要铁道都已畅通了。
    朝鲜北部农民在战时不顾敌机的轰炸破坏，英勇地坚持生产，支持了抗美战争。停战以后，朝鲜北部农民便积极地进行农业的恢复工作。他们首先努力恢复靠近前线地区和海滨地区的农田，填平炸弹坑和炮弹坑，大力抢修贮水池，并进行扩大和新建灌溉工程的工作。预计在今年春耕以前，耕地便可基本上恢复。目前朝鲜北部农民正在大力进行春耕生产的各种准备工作，他们计划在一九五四年要比一九五三年增产粮食百分之二十。他们有信心在一、二年内，使农业生产不仅达到而且要超过战前的水平。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府对于战后人民生活的安定和改善，表示了极大的关怀。随着恢复建设事业的迅速进展及各兄弟国家的大量援助，北部广大人民的生活也得到了改善。停战以后，政府便大量贷款给工人、农民及军人家属修建住宅和从事生产。战时住在土窟里的人们纷纷搬进新建的房屋。到今年一月，平壤市已新建了一万五千多所房屋，一百二十多栋机关办公处，八十多家工厂和一百三十多座仓库。各地工人和职员去年都普遍得到了政府配给的煤、棉布、棉衣及食品等大量的过冬物品。各地农民也得到了政府配给的棉布。政府的商业部门在一九五三年三月、七月和十二月三次减低了日用必需品的价格，数十种物品的价格降低了百分之五十以上，市场的物价也随着降低，劳动人民的购买力有了显著的提高。
    朝鲜人民在取得恢复国民经济初步成就的基础上，从今年起满怀信心地开始执行战后恢复和发展人民经济的三年计划。英雄的朝鲜人民确信，他们在不久的将来完全能够把遭到战争严重破坏的人民经济恢复到战前水平，并使之进一步发展。
    朝鲜经济恢复和发展的最大特点，是在新的技术基础上恢复原有工厂和建设新的工厂，以便根本上改变在日本殖民统治下所造成的朝鲜工业的畸形状态，使朝鲜成为有自己独立工业的国家。在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家巨大的物质和技术援助下，朝鲜将建设几十个过去从来没有的工厂。在不久的将来，朝鲜的机械工业将能够自己生产工作母机、原动机、汽车零件、抽水机、电动机、变压器等。正在加紧建设中的第一个汽车工厂，到一九五七年便可年产六千辆汽车。
    朝鲜的都市也将迅速地重新建设起来。朝鲜内阁已经拟定了恢复和重建北部各主要城市的宏伟计划。按照这个计划，朝鲜北部的城市将建设为现代化的、文明的城市，并成为和国家的工业发展及人民的物质、文化生活的不断提高相适应的新型都市。现在，平壤、元山、清津、咸兴、兴南、新义州和沙里院等城市的劳动人民，都在以高度的热忱和速度，展开紧张的恢复重建的巨大工作。
    朝鲜的恢复重建工作是艰巨的。但是，朝鲜人民具有胜利完成这一光荣任务的一切条件。朝鲜人民有着以金日成元帅为首的劳动党和政府的正确领导。朝鲜劳动党已成为朝鲜人民战胜一切困难，进行和平建设，维护独立自由与恢复国家统一的斗争中的坚强的鼓舞者和组织者。朝鲜人民经过了打败美国侵略者的严重考验，正以百倍的信心和热忱，团结在自己的亲密的党的周围，创造新的生活。英雄的觉悟的朝鲜人民具备着勤劳建设自己国家的高贵品质。他们的和平建设工作拥有丰富的资源，恢复和发展人民经济所需的铁、有色金属、木材、煤炭、电力以及其他工业原料都是取之不尽的。朝鲜人民在恢复重建事业中，得到了苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的巨大的无私的援助。民主阵营各国政府和人民，把朝鲜的恢复重建工作当作是与自己休戚相关的任务。苏联政府已决定赠送朝鲜人民十亿卢布的物资，我国和朝鲜签订了中朝经济及文化合作协定，并赠送朝鲜人民八万亿元人民币的物资。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚等人民民主国家也都给予了巨大的援助。各兄弟国家并派遣专家和技术人员到朝鲜去帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设。在抗美援朝战争中和朝鲜人民并肩作战的中国人民志愿军，在停战后也大力地参加朝鲜的恢复重建工作，帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。各兄弟国家物质上和技术上的巨大援助，减轻了朝鲜人民医治战争创伤的许多困难，推动了朝鲜恢复重建工作的迅速进展。
    朝鲜北部恢复重建工作的胜利进展，有着重大的意义。迅速地恢复和发展被战争破坏了的人民经济，安定人民生活，并巩固地建立国家工业化的经济基础，是保障胜利果实和谋求国家和平统一的可靠保证。朝鲜人民和平建设的成就，有助于增强整个和平民主阵营和世界人民保卫和平的力量。
