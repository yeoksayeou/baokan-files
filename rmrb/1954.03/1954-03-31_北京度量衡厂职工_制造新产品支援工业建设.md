    Beijing Metrology Factory Workers
    Manufacture New Products to Support Industrial Construction
    The state-owned Beijing Metrology Factory is a factory with a long history. In the past, it could only manufacture platform scales and some copper and iron weights, and the quality was very low. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the political consciousness of the factory's workers has continuously improved, and they have actively studied technology, manufacturing many new products - track scales, large precision balances, analytical balances with an accuracy of 1/10,000 of a gram, and various types of truck scales. The four new track scales manufactured by the factory last year have now been installed in newly built and expanded thermal power plants and iron and steel plants. (Luo Bin)

    北京度量衡厂职工
    制造新产品支援工业建设
    国营北京度量衡厂，是一个历史较久的工厂。过去，只能制造台秤，及一部分铜铁法码等，而且质量很低。解放后该厂职工在党的领导下，政治觉悟不断提高，积极钻研技术，制造出许多新产品——轨道衡，大型精密天平，万分之一公分的分析天平，各类汽车秤。该厂去年作的四台新产品轨道衡，现在都已安装在新建和扩建的火力发电厂和炼铁厂了。（罗斌）
