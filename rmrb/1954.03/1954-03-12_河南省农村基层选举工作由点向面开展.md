    Henan Province's Rural Grassroots Election Work Develops from Points to Areas
    The grassroots election work in the vast rural areas of Henan Province is developing from points to areas. In addition to the 629 townships and towns that have successfully completed elections and established grassroots political power based on the People's Congress system, there are now 1,630 townships, with a population of approximately 4.89 million, that are conducting a large-scale general election campaign. Most of these areas are currently engaged in general election publicity, population surveys, and voter registration. In addition, general election work is about to begin in more than 1,140 townships.
    In order to do a good job in the rural grassroots election work, Pan Fusheng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Provincial Election Committee, gave important instructions on the rural grassroots election work at the Fourth Provincial Civil Affairs Work Conference. He pointed out that rural grassroots election work must be combined with the general line propaganda, spring production, production for disaster relief, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, to fully promote democracy and use the general election as a driving force to promote spring production. Party and government leaders at all levels in the province attach great importance to the general election work. Special districts and counties have successively established and improved general election work organizations and formulated plans. The county party secretaries' meetings convened by the CCP Xuchang, Anyang, and Shangqiu prefectural committees all specifically discussed the general election work plan. The Shangqiu Prefectural Commissioner's Office also convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the general election pilot areas in various counties to summarize the work experience of the pilot areas. Taikang County convened a people's representative conference to discuss and arrange the general election work. The counties also selected and trained a large number of guidance cadres and technical cadres to participate in the general election work. According to incomplete statistics from Luoyang and Zhengzhou special districts, more than 6,000 guidance cadres and technical cadres have been put into the general election campaign.
    After being educated by the general line propaganda and the worker-peasant alliance, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers have been greatly improved. They are even more encouraged by the implementation of the People's Congress system. Many people have expressed their desire to actively participate in the general election, elect activists who take the lead in implementing the general line, and guide everyone to take the socialist road. Now the broad masses of farmers are investing in the solemn election campaign with practical actions of active production.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the rural grassroots election work and disseminate and exchange experiences in a timely manner, the Henan Provincial Election Committee Office will organize working groups to conduct inspections in various special districts.

    河南省农村基层选举工作由点向面开展
    河南省广大农村的基层选举工作正由点向面开展。全省除六百二十九个乡、镇已胜利完成选举，建立了人民代表大会制的基层政权以外，现在有一千六百三十个乡，约四百八十九万人口的地区，正在进行规模宏大的普选运动。这些地区，大部分正在进行普选宣传和人口调查、选民登记。另外还有一千一百四十多个乡的普选工作也即将展开。
    为了做好农村的基层选举工作，中共河南省委员会书记、省选举委员会主席潘复生在省第四次民政工作会议上对农村的基层选举工作作了重要的指示。他指出：农村的基层选举工作，必须结合总路线宣传、春季生产、生产救灾和互助合作运动进行，作到充分发扬民主，把普选作为推动春季生产的动力。全省各地党政领导对普选工作都很重视，各专区和县先后建立和健全了普选工作机构，制订了计划。中共许昌、安阳、商邱等地委召开的县委书记会议上均专门讨论了普选工作方案。商邱专署还召开了各县普选试办地区的负责干部会议，总结了试办地区的工作经验。太康县召开了各界人民代表会议，讨论布置了普选工作。各县并抽调与训练了大批指导干部和技术干部，参加了普选工作。据洛阳、郑州两专区不完全的统计，已有六千多名指导干部和技术干部投入普选运动。
    广大农民群众受到总路线宣传和工农联盟教育之后，社会主义觉悟和生产积极性大为提高。对于人民代表大会制度的实行，更是欢欣鼓舞。许多人表示要积极参加普选，选举带头贯彻总路线的积极分子，引导大家走社会主义道路。现在广大农民正以积极生产的实际行动，投入庄严的选举运动。
    河南省选举委员会办公室为加强对农村基层选举工作的领导，及时传播与交流经验，将组织工作组到各专区作巡回检查。
