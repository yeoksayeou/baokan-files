The department store system in Northeast China is actively preparing seasonal goods to supply the vast urban and rural population.

According to the consumption patterns of the Northeast region in previous years, the goods most needed by the people in the spring months of March and April are fabrics, clothing, shoes, hats, and various knitted goods. To meet consumers' needs, department stores in various locations are promptly purchasing various twill fabrics, coarse and fine cloth, and printed cloth from both inside and outside the region. To meet the needs of urban workers, more than 40,000 meters of various wool serges will be purchased from wool mills within the region before and after the change of seasons. The Dalian and Harbin department store wholesale stations recently increased this order by 7,000 meters. The ramie fabric produced by the Harbin Flax Factory has been successfully dyed and printed and can be used to make beautiful spring and summer clothing. Various ramie fabrics totaling 550,000 meters have now been allocated to department stores in various locations. The tussah silk fabrics used for making shirts and outerwear have new specifications and patterns this year, and state-owned department stores have ordered them in large quantities. In addition, the department store system has also purchased some woolens, silk fabrics, and corduroy and other high-grade cotton fabrics from within the region. This year, department stores will not only promptly supply sufficient clothing fabrics to the urban and rural population, but will also provide consumers with a greater variety of better-quality clothing materials.

Due to the improvement of people's living standards, the consumption of ready-made garments and various shoes in Northeast China is growing rapidly. The Shenyang Department Store sold more than 11,000 woolen garments in the twenty days of the Spring Festival this year. To fully meet the needs of the people, department stores in various locations are actively preparing to supply these goods. The Shenyang area department store wholesale station has now organized more than 3,800 sewing machines to make nearly 200,000 pieces of ready-made clothing. In the second quarter, it also plans to process 70,000 pieces of various men's, women's, and children's clothing. This year, department stores in major cities and industrial and mining areas also plan to undertake the production of large quantities of seasonal clothing for government agencies, organizations, and factories and mines. This will greatly facilitate consumers, alleviate the phenomenon of the sewing industry being too busy during the seasonal change, and save consumers a portion of their expenses.

In the first two months of the first quarter, department stores in various locations prepared more than one million pairs of sneakers; around May Day, more than 600,000 pairs of white rubber shoes will be supplied to the people of the entire region. Department store wholesale stations in various locations have also organized a large number of leather shoes from within and outside the region. The Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station alone will purchase more than 110,000 pairs. In addition, sufficient preparations have been made for raincoats, rubber boots, vests, undershirts, and other items needed for spring and summer.

    东北区百货公司系统准备换季商品
    东北区百货公司系统积极准备换季商品，供应广大城乡人民。
    根据东北地区历年的消费规律，在春季的三、四月份，人民需要最多的商品是布匹、服装、鞋帽和各种针织品。为了满足消费者的需要，各地百货公司都及时从关内外采购进各种斜纹布，粗、细布和花布，为满足城市职工的需要，换季前后将从区内毛织厂购进各种毛哔叽四万多公尺，旅大、哈尔滨地区百货批发站最近又增加这项订货七千公尺。哈尔滨亚麻厂生产的亚麻布，已经试验染色、印花成功，可以制作美丽的春、夏季衣服，现在已向各地百货公司调拨了各种亚麻布五十五万公尺。制作衬衣和外衣料子的柞蚕丝绸，今年新增加了一些规格、花色，国营百货公司已经大批订购。除此之外，百货系统还向关内采购了一些毛料、丝织品以及灯芯绒等高级棉织品。今年百货公司不仅将以充足的服装用布及时地供应城乡人民，而且，将以更多的质量较好的各种衣料供给消费者。
    由于人民生活的提高，东北地区的制成服装和各种鞋子的消费量增长很快。沈阳市百货公司在今年春节二十天内就销出了毛料服装一万一千多件。为了充分满足人民的需要，各地百货公司正积极地准备供应这些商品。沈阳地区百货批发站现已组织三千八百多台缝纫机，做了近二十万件成衣。二季度还准备加工七万件各种男女和小孩服装。今年，各大城市和工矿林区的百货公司还准备承制机关、团体和厂矿等大宗换季服装，这样就大大便利了消费者、缓和换季时期缝纫业忙不过来的现象，并能为消费者节省一部分开支。
    在第一季度头两个月里，各地百货公司就准备了一百多万双球鞋；五一节前后，将有六十多万双白胶鞋供应全区人民。各地百货批发站并从区内外组织了大批皮鞋，仅沈阳百货批发站就将进货十一万多双。此外，对春夏季需用的雨衣、胶靴、背心、汗衫等，也都作了充分的准备。
