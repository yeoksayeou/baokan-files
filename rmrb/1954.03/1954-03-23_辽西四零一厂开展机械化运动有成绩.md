Liaoxi 401 Factory is an old factory with outdated equipment. In the process of mechanized production, it involves a lot of heavy manual labor, and the working conditions for workers are very poor in some areas. Since the factory learned from the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel and launched a mechanization and automation movement, many manual labor tasks have been transformed into mechanized operations. For example, in the past, manual labor was required to transport calcined ore, and workers operated in high temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius, leading to occupational diseases for some. Because the cooling of the calcined ore relied on natural cooling, it took an average of half a month after it was removed from the furnace before it could be loaded and transported, resulting in a large amount of capital tied up each month. Since the "cooling cylinder" was successfully developed, an automatic transportation and cooling device has replaced manual transportation, shortening the cooling time of the calcined ore. In the past, the roasting furnace had to be stopped for cleaning, with radiant heat hitting the workers' faces, making the cleaning work very tiring and affecting production. Since the installation of the cleaning rake, using compressed air instead of manpower, the furnace no longer needs to be stopped during cleaning. The temperature inside the furnace is not affected, ensuring normal production. At the same time, cleaning efficiency has increased tenfold, also reducing the suffering of workers.

    辽西四零一厂开展机械化运动有成绩
    辽西四零一厂是个老厂，设备陈旧，在机械化生产过程中夹杂很多笨重的手工劳动，有些地方工人劳动条件很不好。自从该厂学习鞍钢经验，开展机械化、自动化运动以后，已使许多手工劳动变成了机械化。如过去要用人工运输烧矿，工人在五百度的高温下操作，有的人就得了职业病；因为烧矿要靠自然冷却，出炉后平均需半个月才能装车运走，所以每月都积压大量资金。自从“冷却筒”研究成功以后，用自动运输、冷却的装置，代替了人工运输，缩短了烧矿冷却时间。过去要停车扫除焙烧炉，辐射热扑在工人脸上，扫除工作非常劳累，而且影响生产。自从安装了扫除爬子，用压缩空气代替人力以后，扫除时就不再停炉了，炉内温度不受影响，可保证正常生产，同时扫除效率提高十倍，也减少了工人的痛苦。
