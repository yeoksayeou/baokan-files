    A Visit to the Leningrad Stalin Metal Works
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    "Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country," this is Lenin's famous formula. The Soviet Union has never spared any effort in developing electricity production. Electricity production is an important heavy industry, supplying industry, agriculture, transportation, and people's daily life with the most convenient power. The Soviet Union's electricity production reached 133 billion kilowatt-hours in 1953. Thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations continue to be built. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, expected to be completed in 1955, will generate 11 billion kilowatt-hours annually. New and giant thermal and hydroelectric power stations require the most advanced equipment, especially turbines. The Leningrad Stalin Metal Works (hereinafter referred to as the Stalin Factory) is a factory known throughout the Soviet Union for manufacturing giant turbines. In February, we visited this factory in Leningrad.
    Before the war, the Stalin Factory produced steam hammers, boilers, and turbines. After the war, it specialized in manufacturing steam turbines and water turbines. Comrade Bushuyev, the chief engineer, briefly introduced the factory's development. It is, in fact, a portrayal of the development of the Soviet turbine manufacturing industry.
    Before the October Revolution, this factory only produced steam turbines with a generating capacity of about 1,000 kilowatts and relied on foreign designs. After the October Revolution, the factory gradually trained technical cadres and established huge workshops, capable of manufacturing turbines according to its own designs and drawings, using domestic steel. In 1930, during the First Five-Year Plan, it was already able to produce turbines with a generating capacity of 24,000 kilowatts; a year later, it was already able to produce turbines with a generating capacity of 50,000 kilowatts. The production of these two large steam turbines helped to complete the development of electricity plans in the country's first and second Five-Year Plans. In 1941, the factory manufactured steam turbines with a generating capacity from 25,000 kilowatts to 100,000 kilowatts. After the war, the factory manufactured high-pressure steam turbines; initially manufacturing turbines with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts at 90 atmospheric pressure, and two years ago began manufacturing turbines with a capacity of 150,000 kilowatts at 175 atmospheric pressure and 550 degrees Celsius. Compared with the 29 atmospheric pressure steam turbines before the war, the high-pressure steam turbines after the war are much more powerful.
    In terms of manufacturing water turbines, the Stalin Factory's achievements are even more brilliant. Russia did not produce water turbines before the October Revolution. The Stalin Factory began producing water turbines in 1923, and large-scale ones in 1926. By 1937, the factory manufactured water turbines with a generating capacity of 60,000 kilowatts, while the largest manufactured in the United States at that time was only 48,000 kilowatts. After the war, in order to restore the hydroelectric power stations destroyed by German fascists in the war, the factory carried out huge work. The Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station had nine turbines that needed to be restored. The Stalin Factory manufactured six, and the other three were given to the American Electric Company to manufacture. Later, the performance of the turbines in operation proved that the turbines manufactured by the Stalin Factory were far superior to those manufactured by the United States. Now the factory is manufacturing giant water turbines for Soviet large hydropower stations.
    The steam turbines and water turbines manufactured by the Stalin Factory not only meet the needs of the Soviet Union but also supply the People's Democracies. The factory manufactured four steam turbines with a generating capacity of 25,000 kilowatts to 50,000 kilowatts (three of which have already been shipped) and two water turbines with a generating capacity of 80,000 kilowatts for our country. The factory has also trained interns for our country. Assisting the People's Republic of China is a common phenomenon that can be seen in many factories in the Soviet Union.
    We went to the steam turbine workshop, which was established during the First Five-Year Plan. Cranes were placing the cylinders of the 150,000-kilowatt turbine. Next to a 100,000-kilowatt turbine shaft, thicker than a large tree trunk, several workers were welding the turbine blades. Other workers were measuring the balance of the 50,000-kilowatt turbine shaft. The turbine rotated rapidly and evenly at a speed of 600 revolutions per minute. The maximum speed is 3,000 revolutions per minute. At this speed, according to the chief engineer, it would be possible to travel from Leningrad to Moscow in 25 minutes. In the test station in the workshop, workers were concentrating on assembling the 50,000-kilowatt turbine. They were doing very detailed work. Because each blade weighs only a few kilograms, even a small bump can cause a big loss, for example, reducing the generating capacity by one percent, which is 500 kilowatts.
    We also went to the water turbine workshop, which was established during the Second Five-Year Plan. The turbines manufactured in this workshop are larger than those in the previous workshop, and the lathes used are also larger, including rare turret lathes like houses and planing machines like triumphal arches. Everywhere you can see parts prepared for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. We know that twenty hydroelectric generating units, each with a generating capacity of 126,000 kilowatts, will be installed at this world's largest hydroelectric power station. The turbines of these generating units are manufactured by this workshop, and their generators are manufactured by the Leningrad "Elektrosila" Factory. At the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, a huge flow of 700 cubic meters per second will pass through each hydraulic machine in the future, that is, more than 2.5 million cubic meters of water will flow through per hour, which is equal to the amount of water stored in a lake of one square kilometer and two and a half meters deep. Therefore, huge water turbines and generators are needed. In the workshop of the Stalin Factory, we saw the largest part of the turbine—the stator (Cmamop), which is 14.5 meters in diameter, 4.5 meters high, and weighs 180 tons. Next to the stator, marking technician Dmitriev was completing the marking work. Recently, this stator will be processed by a rare turret lathe. Dmitriev often lectures outside the factory, and even professors attend his lectures. Originally, the stator had to be laid flat, stood upright, and laid sideways during the marking process, but he came up with a simple and economical method that only requires laying it flat. In the workshop, we also saw the rotor (PabozeeKoleco, the force of water passing through it is converted into the force of the rotating shaft) of the turbine with a diameter of 9.3 meters, and each blade weighing 20 tons. The rotor, together with the six thick blades attached to it, weighs 400 tons. The rotor will be installed at the end of the vertical shaft. The diameter of the shaft is 1.4 meters and weighs 70 tons. In the past, when the vertical shaft was processed, the shaft was rotated, but now the machine is rotated, thus increasing labor productivity several times. In the past, the blades had to be finished by hand, but now they are completely made by machines. We know that the generators manufactured by the Leningrad "Elektrosila" Factory are also huge. It is like a large steel tower five or six stories high, with a total weight of 1,600 tons. Therefore, each generating unit (turbine and generator) of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station will be a "giant," about 40 meters high (ten to twelve stories high).
    The Stalin Factory has a strong design force. It conducted a lot of research when designing turbines for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, which shortened the construction of the machine hall of the future hydroelectric power station by 20 meters, thereby saving a lot of funds; and increased the efficiency of the future turbines by 94 percent, thereby obtaining a large amount of supplementary power.
    The Stalin Factory is manufacturing the world's unprecedented single-flow rotating blade water turbine. It was designed under the leadership of Guo Valyov, the chief water turbine designer of the factory. Previously, single-flow water turbines did not have rotating blades. The structure of the single-flow rotating blade water turbine allows the water to flow through the generating unit without changing direction. The rotor of the engine is directly installed on the rim of the rotor of the turbine. It is equipped with perfect regulators and automatic choke devices. This machine is very sturdy and can be directly installed inside the spillway dam body. In this way, there is no need to build another building for the generating machine, and the dam body saves a lot of building materials, so the new type of water turbine has huge economic value. The new machine has been installed at a hydroelectric power station.
    The Stalin Factory's great achievements in manufacturing turbines are due to not being afraid of difficulties, due to attaching importance to the training of technical cadres and workers, attaching importance to technological development, and attaching importance to the development of mass initiative. The chief engineer briefly talked about several ways the factory overcame difficulties.
    After the start of economic construction, the Stalin Factory, like the rest of the Soviet Union, faced the problem of a shortage of technical cadres. At that time, the personnel trained by domestic technical schools were not enough. From 1930, the factory established factory schools, technical schools, secondary technical schools, and higher technical schools. Skilled workers are trained by factory schools, technical schools, and technical research classes. Workers become technicians after going through secondary technical schools and continue to study in higher technical schools. At that time, workers were required to raise themselves to the level of engineers within a few years. An effective learning system was adopted. The students were divided into two groups: one group took classes during the day and did not work; the other group took classes at night and worked during the day. The learning period is one semester. After one semester, the two groups switch with each other. The advantage of this learning system is that theory is closely linked to practice, and urgently needed technical personnel can be quickly trained in one or two years, which normally takes five years. The factory's measures to train cadres yielded good results. The factory established some workshops and large design groups at that time, and the cadres needed were all trained by themselves. Even before the war, the workshop directors and other leading cadres of the factory were all trained by themselves. At that time, factories throughout the Soviet Union implemented this measure of rapidly training cadres.
    Manufacturing large machines is a very difficult task. The Stalin Factory is conducting creative cooperation between production and science. The factory's employees have obtained the help of scientific workers. High-pressure steam turbines and water turbines for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station were all carried out with the assistance of scientific workers. In the middle of 1953, the factory signed more than 40 contracts with relevant scientific research institutions for cooperation on technical problems in production, and these problems could not be solved by the factory's own strength. Scientists such as doctors and masters helped the factory's design team design and draw diagrams, and came to the workshop to help workers summarize operational experience.
    Factory workers also work closely with the technical staff in the factory and have established many mixed groups. Each group has workers, technicians, and engineers participating. The engineers and technicians scientifically analyze the suggestions put forward by the workers and help them realize them. In the steam turbine workshop, I saw a component made up of several parts. It used to take three months to manufacture it. The mixed group studied it; the advanced workers suggested that it could be welded and then processed, and the engineers and technicians also thought it was possible. As a result, it was made in two weeks. The factory also implements the cooperation of new and old workers, with skilled workers leading new workers and passing on experience. The factory also pays attention to cooperation with factories that supply raw materials and materials.
    Due to the long-term systematic promotion of technology and the training of technical personnel, 50 engineering and technical personnel and workers in the Stalin Factory have received Stalin Prizes. Comrade Bushuyev, the chief engineer who received us, is a winner of the Stalin Prize. Academician Guo Valyov, the chief designer, and Dr. Lomogin, who was trained by the factory itself, are both two-time Stalin Prize winners.
    All the employees of the Stalin Factory are enthusiastically carrying out the socialist competition to tap potential capabilities and strive to complete the 1954 production plan on December 5. According to Comrade Vasiliev, the director of the factory: The 1953 plan was overfulfilled, and the January 1954 plan was also successfully completed. In 1953, the factory completed 117.5 percent of the state orders and 105.8 percent of the production volume; the entire factory gave the state an excess profit of 50.08 million rubles. According to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the steam turbines produced by the factory will be two and a half times that of 1950, and the water turbines will be 7.8 times that of 1950. All the employees of the factory are working hard to complete this task. They guarantee to increase production volume by 15 percent in 1954, and increase production volume by 54 percent compared to 1953 (including the production of water turbines). They pay special attention to improving the utilization rate of existing production sites. They guarantee that in the water turbine workshop, the output per square meter of production site will increase by 62 percent, in the metal structure workshop by 20 percent, and in the daily necessities workshop by 130 percent. The Stalin Factory and the Kalinin Polytechnic Institute have signed a contract in which the Institute will help achieve such goals in science and technology, that is, this year, without expanding the production of products, the production site will increase the production of daily necessities by 38 million rubles, an increase of 1.3 times over last year. The increase in the production of water turbines will be achieved through the manufacturing of new lathes, the mechanization of blade section processing, the electric welding of structures, and the reorganization of equipment.
    The visit to the Stalin Metal Works makes one realize more deeply the words in the February 11th letter to the Soviet voters from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Heavy industry has always been and remains the foundation of the peaceful economic development of the Soviet Union and the foundation of the Soviet Union's defense power.

    访列宁格勒斯大林金属制造厂
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    “共产主义就是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化”，这是列宁的著名公式。苏联从来不遗余力地发展电力生产。电力生产，是一项重要的重工业，它供给工业、农业、运输业和人民日常生活以最方便的动力。苏联的电力产量在一九五三年已达到一千三百三十亿瓩时。火力发电厂和水力发电站继续建筑着。预期在一九五五年竣工的古比雪夫水电站每年将发电一百一十亿瓩时。新式的巨大的火力发电厂和水力发电站，需要最完善的设备，特别是轮机（透平）。列宁格勒的斯大林金属制造厂（以下简称斯大林工厂），就是全苏闻名的制造巨型轮机的工厂。二月间我们到列宁格勒访问了这个工厂。
    斯大林工厂在战前生产汽锤、锅炉、轮机，到战后专业化了，专门制造汽轮机和水轮机。总工程师布舒耶夫同志扼要地介绍了工厂发展的情况。它事实上是苏联轮机制造业发展的写照。
    在十月革命以前，这个工厂只生产发电力一千瓩左右的汽轮机，而且要靠外国设计。十月革命以后，工厂逐步培养了技术干部，建立了巨大的车间，能够按照自己的设计和图样，用本国的钢铁，制造轮机。在第一个五年计划时期的一九三○年，已经能生产发电力二万四千瓩的轮机；过了一年，已经能生产发电力五万瓩的轮机。这两种大汽轮机的生产，帮助了国家第一个和第二个五年计划中发展电力计划的完成。一九四一年，工厂制造了发电力从二万五千瓩到十万瓩的汽轮机。战后，工厂制造着高压的汽轮机；起初制造九十大气压力、十万瓩发电力的轮机，两年前开始制造一七五大气压力、五五○瓩度气温、十五万瓩发电力的轮机。比起战前二十九大气压力的汽轮机，战后高压的汽轮机的能力是强大得多了。
    在制造水轮机方面，斯大林工厂的成就更加辉煌，在十月革命前的俄国是不产水轮机的。斯大林工厂在一九二三年开始生产水轮机，一九二六年开始生产大型的。到一九三七年，工厂制造了发电力六万瓩的水轮机，当时美国制造的最大的不过四万八千瓩。战后，为了恢复战争中被德国法西斯破坏的水电站，工厂进行了巨大工作。第聂伯河水电站有九个轮机需要恢复。斯大林工厂制造了六个，另外三个交给了美国电气公司制造。后来轮机在工作中的表现证明，斯大林工厂制造的轮机远比美国制造的为优越。现在工厂正为苏联大水电站制造着巨型水轮机。
    斯大林工厂制造的汽轮机和水轮机，不但满足着苏联国内的需要，也供给人民民主国家。工厂为我国制造四个发电力二万五千瓩到五万瓩的汽轮机（其中三个已经运走），两个发电力八万瓩的水轮机。工厂也为我国培养过实习生。援助中华人民共和国，这是在苏联许多工厂可以看到的普遍现象。
    我们到了汽轮机车间，那是在第一个五年计划时期建立的。吊车在安放十五万瓩的轮机的汽缸。在一根比大树干还粗的十万瓩的轮机的轴旁边，几个工人在电焊着轮机的叶桨。另一些工人在测量五万瓩的轮机的轴的均衡。轮机以每分钟六百转的速度飞快均匀地转动着。最高速度是每分钟三千转。以这样的速度，据总工程师说，在二十五分钟内可以从列宁格勒转到莫斯科。在车间内的试验站上，工人们在聚精会神地装配五万瓩的轮机。他们在做非常细致的工作。因为每个叶桨只有几公斤重，如果碰伤一小点，都会带来很大损失。比方减低百分之一发电力，那就是五百瓩。
    我们也到了水轮机车间，那是第二个五年计划时期建立的。这个车间制造的轮机比前面的车间还大，所用的车床也大，有房子似的稀有转塔车床，凯旋门似的刨床。到处可以看到为古比雪夫水电站所准备的机件。我们知道，在这世界最大的水电站上将安装二十部水力发电联动机，每部发电力十二万六千瓩。这些发电联动机的轮机是由这个车间制造，而它的发电机是由列宁格勒“电力”工厂制造的。在古比雪夫水电站，将来每秒钟将有七百立方公尺的巨流通过每部水力机器，就是每小时将流过二百五十多万立方公尺的水，等于一平方公里、二公尺半深的湖泊里所储的水量。因此，需要巨大的水轮机和发电机。在斯大林工厂的车间，看到了轮机的最大部分——固定子（Cmamop），它的直径十四公尺半，高四公尺半，重一百八十吨。在固定子旁边，标记技工季米特里耶夫在完成着标记工作。最近这个固定子将由稀有转塔车床加工。季米特里耶夫常到厂外讲课，听讲的也有教授。本来进行标记工作时要把固定子平放、竖放、横放，他想出了只要平放的简捷、节约的方法。在车间，也看到了直径九·三公尺的轮机的转动子（PabozeeKoleco，水力经过它变为转轴的力），和每个重二十吨的叶桨。转动子连装在它上面的六个厚大的叶桨，重达四百吨。转动子将安装在竖轴的末端。轴的直径有一·四公尺，重七十吨。过去竖轴被加工时，由轴转动，现在由机器转动，因而提高劳动生产率好几倍。过去叶桨最后要用手工加工，现在完全用机器。我们知道，在列宁格勒“电力”工厂制造的发电机，也是巨大的。它像一座五、六层楼高的大钢塔，总重达一千六百吨。所以，古比雪夫水电站的每部发电联动机（轮机和发电机）将是“巨人”，高约四十公尺（有十到十二层楼高）。
    斯大林工厂拥有强大的设计力量。它在为古比雪夫水电站设计轮机时作了很多研究，使将来水电站的机器厅的建筑缩短二十公尺，从而节约大量资金；使将来轮机的效率提高百分之九十四，从而取得大量补充电力。
    斯大林工厂制造着世界空前的单流转叶水轮机。它是在工厂水轮机总设计师郭瓦廖夫领导下设计的。以前单流水轮机是没有转叶的。单流转叶水轮机的构造，使水流过联动机后可以不变流向。发动机的转子直接安装在轮机的转子的轮缘上。它配备有完善的调整器和自动的阻气装置。这种机器非常结实，可以直接安装在溢水坝坝身内面。这样就用不着为发电机器另盖建筑物，并且使坝身省用许多建筑材料，所以新型水轮机有巨大的节约价值。新型机器已经在一个水电站上安装。
    斯大林工厂在制造轮机方面的巨大成就，是由于不怕困难，是由于重视技术干部和工人的培养，重视技术的发展，重视群众积极性的发扬。总工程师简明地谈了工厂克服困难的几个办法。
    经济建设开始以后，斯大林工厂和苏联全国一样，面临着缺乏技术干部的问题。当时国内技术学校培养的人材不够用。从一九三○年开始，工厂就设立了工厂学校、工艺学校、中等技术学校和高等技术学校。由工厂学校、工艺学校、技术研究班培养熟练工人。工人经过中等技术学校成为技师，继续在高等技术学校学习。当时要求工人在几年以内就把自己提高到工程师的水平。采取了有效的学习制度。把学习人员分成两批：一批白天上课，不工作；另一批晚上上课，白天工作。学习期限为一学期。一学期后两批互相调换。这个学习制度的好处在于理论与实际密切地联系，能够迅速地在一两年内培养出急需的技术人材，而平常要五年。工厂培养干部的措施得出良好结果。工厂当时建立了一些车间和很大的设计组，所需的干部都是自己培养的。还在战前，工厂的车间主任和其他领导干部就都是自己培养的。当时全苏联工厂都实行这种迅速培养干部的措施。
    制造大型机器是很艰巨的任务。斯大林工厂进行着生产与科学的创造性合作。工厂职工取得了科学工作者的帮助。高压的汽轮机和供给古比雪夫水电站的水轮机，都是在科学工作者的协助下进行的。一九五三年中工厂与有关的科学研究机关订了四十多个在生产技术问题上合作的合同，这些问题都是靠工厂自己力量解决不了的。有博士、硕士等科学工作者帮助工厂设计组设计构图，到车间来帮助工人总结操作经验。
    工厂工人也与厂内技术人员密切合作，成立了许多混合组。每组都有工人、技师、工程师参加。工人提出的建议，工程师、技师加以科学的分析，帮助他们实现。在汽轮机车间看见一个由几个零件接成的部件。过去它的制造费时三个月，混合组加以研究；先进工人提出可以电焊然后加工，工程师技师也认为可以。结果两个星期就造出来了。工厂也实行新老工人的合作，由熟练工人带领新手，传授经验。工厂也注意与供给原料、材料的各工厂之间的合作。
    由于长期有系统地推进技术和培养技术人材，斯大林工厂有五十个工程技术人员和工人得到斯大林奖金。接待我们的总工程师布舒耶夫是斯大林奖金获得者。总设计师郭瓦廖夫通讯院士，工厂自己培养出来的洛莫金博士，都是两次斯大林奖金获得者。
    斯大林工厂全体职工热烈地进行着发挥潜在能力、争取在十二月五日完成一九五四年生产计划的社会主义竞赛。据厂长瓦西列夫同志谈：一九五三年计划超额完成了，一九五四年一月计划也顺利完成了。一九五三年，工厂完成了国家订货百分之一一七·五，生产量百分之一○五·八；全厂给国家超额利润五千零八十万卢布。根据第五个五年计划，工厂生产的汽轮机要为一九五○年的二倍半，水轮机为七·八倍。工厂全体职工正为完成这个任务而努力。他们保证在一九五四年增加生产量百分之十五，比一九五三年（包括水轮机的生产）增加生产量百分之五十四。他们特别注意提高现有生产场地的利用率，他们保证在水轮机车间，每平方公尺生产场地提高产量百分之六十二，在金属结构车间提高百分之二十，在日用品车间提高百分之一三○。斯大林工厂和加里宁多科技术学院签订了合同，由学院在科学技术上帮助实现这样的目标，即今年不扩增生产的产品，场地比去年增产三千八百万卢布增产一·三倍的日用品。将经过新式车床的制造，叶桨切面加工的机械化，结构的电焊，设备的改组等等措施来取得水轮机的增产。
    斯大林金属制造厂的访问，令人更深刻地领会到苏联共产党中央委员会二月十一日告苏联选民书中所说的话：重工业一向是而且仍然是苏联和平经济发展的基础，是苏联国防力量的基础。
