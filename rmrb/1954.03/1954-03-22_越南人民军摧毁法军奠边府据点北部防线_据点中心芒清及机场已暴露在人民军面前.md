(Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, March 21st) In four days from the 13th to the 17th, under the heroic Vietnamese People's Army's fierce hammering, the French invading army's northern defense line at the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex was destroyed. The two battalions of French invaders entrenched in the Xinlan, Doc Lap, and Ban Keo (formerly translated as Ban Giao) resistance centers on this line were completely annihilated, and two companies collectively surrendered under the pressure of the Vietnamese People's Army. Now, the center of the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex—Muong Thanh—and the airport are exposed to the Vietnamese People's Army.

Dien Bien Phu is a district in Lai Chau Province in the Northwest Region of Vietnam, located on the border between Vietnam and Laos. The Dien Bien Phu Plain is the largest of the four major plains in Northwest Vietnam, centered on Muong Thanh, spanning three to eight kilometers east-west and twenty kilometers north-south. On November 20, 1953, French invading army commander-in-chief Navarre drew approximately four battalions of troops from the Red River Delta and airdropped them into Dien Bien Phu, attempting to coordinate with the invading army entrenched in Lai Chau city and re-invade the Northwest Liberated Area. Although Navarre and his American masters had the calculations, the Vietnamese People's Army would be the ones to move the beads. Before the invaders jumping from the planes could gain a foothold, 300 of them were eliminated by the Vietnamese People's Army. Subsequently, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive in mid-December, annihilating and routing all the invading army entrenched in Lai Chau in half a month, liberating most of Lai Chau Province, and isolating the Dien Bien Phu invading army. To relieve Dien Bien Phu, Navarre had to draw nine more battalions of elite troops from the tense Red River Delta and other areas and drop them into Dien Bien Phu, establishing a so-called stronghold complex there.

After firmly pinning down about one-fifth of the French invading army's total mobile forces in the Indochina battlefield at Dien Bien Phu, the Vietnamese People's Army, in close coordination with the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Cambodian People's Armed Forces, launched successful offensives on various battlefields in Indochina.

On March 13th—more than 100 days after the French invading army airdropped into Dien Bien Phu—the Vietnamese People's Army began attacking this invading army stronghold complex, which was touted as an "aircraft carrier in the mountains." The spearhead of the offensive was first directed at Xinlan, a resistance center protruding on a hill in the northeast direction. This resistance center, connected by three supporting points and many bunkers, was one of the strongest resistance centers in the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex, defended by the French invading army's 3rd Foreign Legion Battalion. The offensive began at 4:00 PM. Heroic soldiers of a certain unit of the Vietnamese People's Army, under the cover of artillery fire, quickly approached the invading army's resistance center, destroyed the dense barbed wire, blasted open breakthroughs, and bravely penetrated deep. At 6:50 PM, the first red flag was already planted on top of the bunker of the invading army company command post at strongpoint number three. This red flag was carried forward by combat hero Chen Gan. Soon, the second red flag fluttered over strongpoint number two. Strongpoint number three was the location of the invading army's battalion command post, and the fighting was extremely fierce. Various caliber artillery pieces of the invading army concentrated their fire from strongpoints such as Muong Thanh and Doc Lap, attempting to stop the Vietnamese People's Army's offensive. However, the heroic soldiers of a certain unit of the Vietnamese People's Army stubbornly carried out blasting operations again and again. At 10:37 PM, they launched an assault, and the leader of the assault group, Nguyen Huu Oanh, was the first to rush into the breakthrough. Fifteen minutes later, the heroes of the Vietnamese People's Army occupied the enemy's battalion command post and continued to advance deep. By the time the battle was completely resolved that night, the entire elite 3rd Foreign Legion Battalion of the French invading army had been killed, wounded, or captured alive, with no one escaping. At this time, the signal of victory of the Vietnamese People's Army rose above Xinlan, the resistance center that the French invading army called the strongest.

Immediately afterward, a certain unit of the Vietnamese People's Army advanced on Doc Lap mountain, another resistance center of the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex. This resistance center was located on a saddle-shaped hill, 700 meters long from north to south, north of Muong Thanh, and defended by the French invading army's 5th Battalion of the 7th North African Regiment. Soldiers of a certain unit of the Vietnamese People's Army quietly entered their positions on the night of the 14th and suddenly launched an attack at 2:00 AM on the 15th. At 3:50 AM, a certain spearhead company had already wedged into a breakthrough on the north side of Doc Lap mountain, eliminated several enemy firepower points, and continued to press south. The first squad of a certain unit, after leading the charge into the breakthrough, quickly advanced towards the enemy's battalion headquarters. Deputy squad leader and combat hero Nguyen Van Cac was wounded three times but remained on the front line. New recruit Wu Chongsong took over the red flag from a fallen comrade and planted it on top of the enemy's battalion command post. This was at 4:40 AM. When the troops pressing in from the north reached the other end of the saddle-shaped hill, they victoriously joined forces with the troops who had entered the Doc Lap stronghold from other gaps. At 7:00 AM, after the People's Army artillery repelled enemy troops reinforcing from Muong Thanh, the entire battle was resolved, and another elite infantry battalion of the French invading army was completely wiped out, with the entire battalion commander and below killed, wounded, and captured alive.

Following the annihilation of the two battalions of French invading army at Xinlan and Doc Lap, the Vietnamese People's Army turned its spearhead towards Ban Keo, another resistance center in the northwest of the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex, tightly surrounding most of the puppet 3rd Thai Battalion entrenched there. On the morning of the 17th, as soon as the artillery fire of a certain unit of the Vietnamese People's Army began to bombard, the French battalion commander of this puppet army battalion hurriedly fled south. Immediately, more than 50 people forcibly conscripted by the invading army ran to the Vietnamese People's Army's positions. Following them, two companies of Thai puppet troops came to surrender to the Vietnamese People's Army with full arms. By this point, the invading army in the northern sector of the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex was completely annihilated.

After suffering heavy blows from the Vietnamese People's Army, the French invading army entrenched in the Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex was extremely panicked. Every day, people quietly ran out to surrender with leaflets from the Vietnamese People's Army. Urged on by the American warmongers, the French invading army headquarters is now simultaneously concealing its defeats and stepping up efforts to draw troops from the Red River Delta and central Laos and send them to Dien Bien Phu. Since the 15th, approximately two battalions of French invading army have been airlifted to Dien Bien Phu by American aircraft.

    越南人民军摧毁法军奠边府据点北部防线
    据点中心芒清及机场已暴露在人民军面前
    【新华社北越二十一日电】自十三日到十七日四天中，在英勇的越南人民军猛烈的捶击下，法国侵略军奠边府集团据点的北部防线已被摧毁，困守在这一线的新兰、独立山、板骄（前译本交）三个抵抗中心的法国侵略军两个营全部被歼灭，两个连在越南人民军威逼下集体投降。现在奠边府集团据点的中心——芒清以及飞机场，已经暴露在越南人民军的面前了。
    奠边府是越南西北联区莱州省的一个县，位于越南和寮国边境。奠边府平原是越南西北四大平原中最大的一个平原，以芒清为中心，东西宽三至八公里，南北长二十公里。一九五三年十一月二十日，法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔从红河三角洲抽调约四个营的兵力空投到奠边府，企图和困守在莱州市区的侵略军互相呼应，并重新进犯西北解放区。算盘虽然拿在纳瓦尔和他的美国主子手里，但是算盘珠子却由越南人民军来拨。当那些从飞机上跳下来的侵略军还没有站稳脚跟时，就被越南人民军消灭了三百名。接着，越南人民军在十二月中旬展开攻势，半个月中歼灭和击溃困守莱州的全部侵略军，解放莱州省大部地区，使奠边府侵略军陷于孤立无援的境地。为了解救奠边府，纳瓦尔不得不从正在吃紧的红河三角洲等地，再抽出九个营的精锐部队投到奠边府，并在那里建立所谓集团据点。
    把约占法国侵略军在印度支那战场全部机动兵力的五分之一牢牢地钉在奠边府之后，越南人民军和寮国人民解放军、高棉人民武装密切配合，在印度支那各个战场上胜利地展开攻势。
    到三月十三日——法国侵略军空降奠边府以后的一百多天，越南人民军开始向这个被吹嘘做“山林中的航空母舰”的侵略军集团据点进行攻击。进攻的矛头首先指向突出在东北方向一个山包上的抵抗中心——新兰。这个抵抗中心由三个支撑点和许多地堡联结组成，是奠边府集团据点中最强固的抵抗中心之一，由法国侵略军外籍军团第三营据守。进攻在下午四时开始。越南人民军某部的英雄战士在炮火的掩护下，迅速地接近侵略军的抵抗中心，破坏密密层层的铁丝网，炸开了突破口，勇猛地向纵深穿插。六时五十分，第一面红旗已经插在三号据点侵略军连指挥所的碉堡顶上。这面红旗是由战斗英雄陈干高举着前进的。不久，第二面红旗又在二号据点的上空飘扬起来了。三号据点是侵略军营指挥所的所在地，战斗进行得十分激烈。侵略军各种口径的大炮，从芒清、独立山等据点集中地向那里轰击，企图阻止越南人民军的进攻。但是英勇的越南人民军某部战士顽强地一次又一次地进行爆破，十时三十七分发起冲锋，领头冲进突破口的是突击组组长阮有莺。十五分钟后，越南人民军的英雄们就占领了敌人的营指挥所，继续向纵深发展。到当天夜晚完全解决战斗，精锐的法国侵略军外籍军团第三营全部被击毙、击伤或生俘，无一漏网。这时候，在法国侵略军号称为最强固的抵抗中心——新兰的上空，升起了越南人民军胜利的信号。
    紧接着，越南人民军某部又向奠边府集团据点另一抵抗中心——独立山进击。这个抵抗中心位于芒清以北的一座马鞍形的南北长七百公尺的山包上，由法国侵略军第七北非团第五营据守。越南人民军某部的战士十四日晚即悄悄进入阵地，到十五日清晨二时突然发起攻击，三时五十分，某尖刀连已经楔入了独立山北面的一个突破口，消灭了敌人几个火力点后即继续向南面压进。某部第一小队领头冲进突破口后，就迅速向敌人营部前进。副小队长、战斗英雄阮文各三次负伤不下火线。新战士武崇松从牺牲的战友手中接过红旗，插到敌人营指挥所的顶上，这时候是四时四十分。从北面压进的部队到达马鞍形山包的另一端的时候，便和从别的缺口进入独立山据点的部队胜利地会师了。早晨七时，在人民军炮兵击退敌人自芒清增援的部队后，全部解决战斗，法国侵略军又一个精锐步兵营全部覆没，自营长以下全被击毙、击伤和生擒。
    继歼灭新兰和独立山两个营的法国侵略军后，越南人民军又把进攻的矛头指向奠边府集团据点西北部的另一抵抗中心——板骄，把困守在那里的伪军第三泰族营大部紧紧地包围起来。十七日上午，越南人民军某部炮火刚一开始轰击，这个伪军营法籍营长便慌忙向南逃命，当即有五十多个被侵略军强抓的群众跑到越南人民军阵地上来，随后是两个连带着全副武装的泰族伪军前来向越南人民军投降。至此，奠边府集团据点北部分区的侵略军全部覆没。
    遭受越南人民军重大打击之后，困守在奠边府集团据点里的法国侵略军恐慌异常，每天都有人带着越南人民军的传单悄悄地跑出来投降。法国侵略军总部在美国战争贩子的催促下，现在正一面掩饰它的败绩，一面加紧从红河三角洲和中寮等地抽调兵力投到奠边府。自十五日以来，由美国飞机载运空投到奠边府的法国侵略军约有两营人。
