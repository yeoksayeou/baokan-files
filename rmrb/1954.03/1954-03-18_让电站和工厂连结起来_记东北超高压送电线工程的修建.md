Connecting Power Plants and Factories
——A Record of the Construction of the Northeast Extra-High Voltage Power Transmission Line Project
　　Pei Lan
    On the vast Northeast plains, a 220,000-volt extra-high voltage power transmission line, crossing countless mountains, spanning many rivers, and traversing boundless plains, connects the power base on the Songhua River with many factories in cities such as Anshan, Shenyang, Benxi, and Fushun. Tens of thousands of machines waiting for electricity have begun to turn, and many newly built factories and mines can also obtain sufficient power and develop rapidly.
    This line is one of the key projects in my country's first Five-Year Plan, with a total length of 370 kilometers, passing through three provinces, with many high mountains and steep ridges along the route, making construction very difficult. However, the workers installed 919 iron towers and erected 2,180 tons of steel-cored aluminum wire as thick as sugarcane in less than half a year, completing the entire project ahead of schedule.

    The entire project started on July 15, 1953. Because the task was urgent, we could only adopt the method of designing on one side and constructing on the other, with staggered progress, which caused many difficulties for the construction. At the beginning, the project progress was very slow. By the end of September, only 39% of the foundation work had been completed; however, the remaining 61% of the foundation work had to be completed in October. Otherwise, the ground would freeze, and the foundation work could not be carried out at all. If the foundation work was not completed, the extra-high voltage power transmission line could not be erected. The workers understood the importance of seizing the time and universally launched a patriotic labor competition.
    This kind of line project is fundamentally different from building concentrated factories and buildings. Its construction site is scattered along a long line. One group of workers pours concrete here today, and tomorrow they will have to move to a place ten kilometers, twenty kilometers, or even thirty kilometers away. It is inconvenient to move the concrete mixing machine frequently, so we can only use small manual tools. However, the amount of concrete work for this project is very large. The entire line has 919 iron towers, each iron tower requires four foundations, which requires pouring more than 3,600 foundations and pouring 9,300 cubic meters of concrete.
    When the concrete project entered its peak period, more than 6,000 people participated in the work, two-thirds of whom were farmers and workers from other factories and mines who supported the project. Together with the workers of the Northeast Power Transmission and Transformation Engineering Company, which undertook the entire construction project, they tried every means to create various tools to ensure the completion of their tasks. In some places where iron towers are located, there is quicksand, so they use wooden boards to surround the area and jump in the middle to work. In some places, there are rocks, so they use the Soviet "hard rock blasting method" to crush the rocks and then carry out construction. Some iron towers are located on the tops of high mountains, and the mountains are steep and there is no road to pass through, so they climb up by grabbing ropes like the scouts in the movie "Taking Mount Hua by Strategy." When digging the foundation of tower No. 44, they encountered a large amount of water. Worker Wu Zhi tried to block the water, but could not block it. He used a scoop to scoop it out, but could not scoop it all out. Then he used two water pumps to pump it, but could not dry it out. So all the workers in the team jumped into the water pit, holding all the tools they could use to scoop water. By scooping and pumping, they finally dried the water and began to pour concrete.
    After the foundation work entered the tense month of October, all links became tense. The material clerk made a plan: "When the train brings the materials, we will immediately配好 the materials." The truck drivers said: "When the materials are配好, we will immediately transport them to the construction site." The workers installing the tower legs proposed: "As long as the materials come, we will not let them stop for an hour." The transportation workers created various small wooden boxes, carrying cement, sand, and water, and quickly transported them to the construction site. The staff of the Shuanghezhen material station of the 301 Engineering Team used to配三基 towers for four or five hours, but now it only takes one hour. Tower No. 151 is located on a steep mountain, and there is no way to transport materials. Transportation squad leader Zhou Shanghai used the existing iron ropes and pulleys on the construction site to create a "high mountain transport flying car" and hung the material basket on the pulley to transport it to the mountain. All such creations ensured the rapid progress of the project.
    At the beginning, the extreme dispersion of the construction site brought great difficulties to the engineering leadership. Although the project headquarters was located in the center of the line, it was still very far from the construction sites at both ends. It often took several days to convey a task to the construction site. Later, the responsible cadres of the headquarters were inspired by the Soviet novel "Far from Moscow" and immediately strengthened the communication equipment. Every day, they conveyed the intentions of the headquarters and learned about the work of each construction site through telephone calls. In this way, the entire 370-kilometer line project completely became a closely coordinated whole. On the evening of October 30, all the concrete projects were successfully completed.

    In November, the Northeast was completely frozen. The snow on the plains was knee-deep, and the snow on the high mountains was even thicker. The workers began to install the iron towers on the snow.
    These 919 iron towers are all screw structures. There are ten types of tower shapes, the highest is 46 meters and weighs 16.4 tons. The error of the center line of the iron tower cannot exceed one thousandth, and some cannot exceed two thousandths.
    Assembling iron towers is putting together many differently shaped steel plates. It looks like it's not difficult, but it's not that easy to do. Most of the workers of the Northeast Power Transmission and Transformation Engineering Company had never done this job before, and some workers were afraid to go up to the iron towers at first. In order to solve this problem, the headquarters launched an iron tower training movement in January 1953, and a total of more than 800 workers participated in this training movement.
    The headquarters prepared six iron tower steel materials and six iron tower models. The workers got up early every day and practiced assembling iron towers in groups. They were like children playing with building blocks, stacking one shape,嘩啦嘩啦 dismantling it and stacking it again. They dismantled and stacked it like this, stacked it and dismantled it again. After assembling repeatedly several times in the morning, the engineering technicians participated in meetings with each group in the afternoon to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the assembly method and put forward the areas that needed improvement. Then, they used another method to assemble on the second day. Old worker Su Yunlong and two others studied assembly together with everyone during the day, and at night they moved the model to the dormitory to study. Yang Zhaoqing, an old technician who had participated in the construction of extra-high voltage power transmission line projects during the puppet Manchuria period, pondered day and night. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet "overall tower erection method" and based on the geographical conditions of the construction site, he created the "double-boom overall tower erection method." Some groups, with the help of technicians, researched and created the "disassembly tower erection method" and other iron tower assembly methods. The creative spirit of the workers and the theory of the engineering technicians combined together became an endless force. Through a short two months of study, the vast majority of workers mastered the technology of assembling iron towers, which laid a solid foundation for the formal installation project.
    Before the formal installation project started, the headquarters concentrated more than 100 people, including construction site directors, squad leaders, group leaders, and old technical workers from the entire line, selected different tower types and different sites, and first assembled three iron towers to make everyone further familiar with the operating procedures and master the quality standards. After the "pilot" was completed, the tower assembly project was fully launched.
    The biting northwest wind rolled snow flakes, stabbing people's bodies like needles. In order to seize the time, the workers worked continuously day and night. Their sweat soaked through the cotton clothes and quickly formed thin ice; the body temperature melted the thin ice again, and the water column kept flowing down the skin. But they relied on a fiery heart to overcome the wind, snow, and severe cold. Once, the workers of Sun Kejian's team had just arrived at the construction site when it started to snow, and it was getting heavier and heavier. The party branch secretary advised everyone to stop working, but they said: "Even sharp knives can't stop us. When will we finish installing this iron tower, and when will we go back!" The engineering technicians guiding the construction worked together with the workers, persisting day and night.
    At the beginning, the efficiency of assembling iron towers was not high. It took three days for general-type iron towers and five or six days for special-type iron towers with complex structures. In order to improve work efficiency, the workers created many advanced work methods. The workers of Sun Kejian's team created parallel flow operation method and cross flow operation method, which greatly improved work efficiency. Their team originally planned to assemble fourteen iron towers, but they assembled eighteen, overfulfilling the task.
    The tower assembly team led by Wang Xichun guaranteed the completion of the task in the situation of scattered construction sites, insufficient manpower, and low technical conditions. At the beginning, the temporary workers in the team did not understand the screw sizes, and often took the wrong screws, which affected the progress of the work. Wang Xichun and the old technicians researched and piled the screws separately, and then marked them with one, two, three... This greatly improved the work efficiency. They also researched and created the "double rope binding method." In the past, it took two or three days to assemble a certain type of iron tower 25.6 meters high. Using this method, it only took nine hours to assemble. Therefore, their team won the glorious red flag of the excellent team for two consecutive times.
    Driven by these advanced figures and advanced teams, the efficiency of the iron tower assembly project increased rapidly, from assembling one tower in three days at the beginning to assembling one tower every day on average. Some special-type iron towers with complex structures also increased from assembling one tower in five or six days at the beginning to assembling one tower in three days. The entire iron tower assembly project actually only took one and a half months, and the quality fully met the national requirements.

    Stringing wires is the final link in the entire project. On complex terrain, in severe cold of minus thirty or forty degrees, carrying out high-altitude operations to string three heavy steel-cored aluminum wires as thick as sugarcane is certainly not an easy task. Before the trial operation, the headquarters organized the wire stringing cadres and workers to study the advanced experience of the Soviet "aerial stringing method" and "three-wire tightening method." At that time, some old technical workers believed that the terrain was too bad to string three wires at the same time. During the puppet Manchukuo period, when the Japanese aggressors built the Songfu power transmission line, they put the wires on the ground and then hoisted them up, stringing one wire at a time. However, a roll of steel-cored aluminum wire is 1,200 meters long and weighs 2,400 tons. If the old wire stringing method is used, it will waste manpower and time; moreover, the aluminum skin is very soft. Using the old wire stringing method, it is easy to scratch and wear the aluminum. Using the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can completely avoid these shortcomings.
    After the wire stringing project started, the entire line immediately became tense. The wire releasing workers stood one by one in three rows, pulling the steel-cored aluminum wire, carefully preventing it from touching the ground. The wire stringing workers installed "four-wheel pulleys" on the iron towers according to the advanced Soviet experience, and put the wires on the pulleys; the tractor drivers started the machines, and the machines rumbled and moved, pulling the steel-cored aluminum wire slowly forward. The crimping workers prepared the "hydraulic press" early and crimped the joints of the steel-cored aluminum wire under the guidance of engineering technicians. The workers of the tightening team took the "sag board" and "theodolite" and carefully measured the arc of the wire.
    It is very difficult to carry out high-altitude operations in the cold winter. Although the workers wore gloves, their hands lost sensation before they climbed halfway up the iron tower. They hung the "safety belt" or "safety basket" on the iron tower to bear the weight of the whole body, then let go of their hands and rubbed them, and continued to climb up. The workers of the wire stringing team had to climb up the strings of porcelain bottles hanging on the iron towers to work, just as the workers joked: it's really like an acrobat walking on a tightrope. But they are stringing steel wires, and their whole body is hung on the iron tower with a "safety belt" or "safety basket." Only the upper body can move, but the lower body cannot move. They work like this for four or five hours at a time. The upper body is drenched in sweat, and the two legs are frozen stiff. In this way, they completed the entire wire stringing project in a short period of 73 days, based on ensuring quality and ensuring safety.

    On the evening of January 24, the stars filled the sky, the earth was quiet, and people were already sound asleep. However, all the workers building the 220,000-volt extra-high voltage power transmission line project were waiting tensely and excitedly on the vast snowfield. At this moment, the electricity from Fengman was about to be transmitted to South Manchuria through this line. In order to prevent accidents, the headquarters also organized ten repair teams. At this time, the workers were in piles of three or groups of five, some were talking excitedly, some were waiting calmly, and the young workers were jumping and singing. At twelve o'clock at midnight, the high-altitude power line made a "唰、唰" sound, and people cheered loudly "Electricity is coming," "Electricity is coming." Hundreds of pairs of eyes were staring at the power line, and the workers of the repair team were nervously checking, but they did not find a place where the electricity was sparking. The workers smiled, they were victorious!

    让电站和工厂连结起来
    ——记东北超高压送电线工程的修建
  　培蓝
    在辽阔的东北原野上，一条二十二万伏超高压送电线，越过无数高山，跨过许多河流，穿过一望无际的平原，把松花江畔的动力基地和鞍钢、沈阳、本溪、抚顺等城市的许多工厂连在一起。多少万部等待电力的机器转动起来了，多少新建的工厂和矿山，也能够得到充足的电力，迅速地发展起来。
    这条线路是我国第一个五年建设计划中的重点工程之一，全长三百七十公里，经过三个省，沿线高山峻岭很多，施工非常困难。但工人们却在不足半年的时间内，安装了九百一十九座铁塔，架设了两千一百八十吨像甘蔗那样粗的钢心铝线，提前完成了全部工程任务。一
    整个工程是从一九五三年七月十五日开工的。因为任务紧急，当时只能采取一面设计，一面施工，前后交错进行的办法，这就给施工造成了很多困难。开始工程进度很慢，到九月底，打基础工程只作了百分之三十九；但是，其余百分之六十一的基础工程必须在十月份作完。否则，地面封冻，根本不能进行基础工程。而基础工程完不成，超高压送电线就架不起来。职工们知道了争取时间的重要意义，普遍开展了爱国主义劳动竞赛。
    这种线路工程和建筑集中的工厂、楼房根本不同。它的工地散布在一条漫长的线上，一班工人今天在这里打混凝土，明天就要转移到十公里、二十公里甚至三十公里以外的地方。搅拌混凝土的机器，不便经常移动，于是只能使用小型的手工工具。但这种工程的混凝土工作量却是很大的。全线九百一十九座铁塔，每座铁塔需要四个基础，这就要打三千六百多个基础，浇灌九千三百立方公尺混凝土。
    混凝土工程进到高潮时期，有六千多人参加工作，其中三分之二是支援这一工程的农民和其他厂矿的工人。他们和担任全部修建工程的东北送变电工程公司的工人一起，想尽了各种办法，创造了各种工具，保证完成自己的任务。有些铁塔座落的地方有流砂，他们就用木板把四周围起来，跳在中间工作。有些地方是岩石，他们就采用苏联“坚石爆破法”，把岩石炸碎，然后施工。有些铁塔座落在高山顶上，山势险峻，无路可通，他们就和“智取华山”影片中的侦察员那样，抓着绳子攀上去。四十四号铁塔地基，挖坑时遇到了大水，工人吴志想办法堵水，堵不住，他就用瓢往外舀，舀不完，又用两台水泵抽，也抽不干，于是全班职工便跳下水坑，拿着所有可能利用的工具舀水，这样又舀又抽，终于将水弄干了，开始浇灌混凝土。
    打基础工程进入紧张的十月后，各个环节都紧张起来了。材料员订出计划：“火车运来材料，马上把料配好。”汽车司机们说：“材料配好了，立刻运到工地。”安装铁塔塔脚的工人提出：“只要材料来了，一小时也不让它停下。”运输工人创造了各种小木箱，背着水泥、砂子和水，迅速地运送到工地上。三○一工程队双河镇材料站的工作人员，过去配三基塔需要四、五小时，现在一小时就配好了。一百五十一号铁塔座落在一个笔陡的高山上，没有办法运送材料。运输班长周尚海利用工地上现有的铁索和滑车，创造了一个“高山运输飞车”，把材料筐挂到滑车上，运到山上。一切类似这样的创造，都保证了工程的迅速进展。
    开始时，工地的极度分散，曾经给工程领导方面带来很大的困难。工程指挥部虽然设在线路的中心，但距两端的工地仍是很远很远，布置一次任务，往往需要好几天的时间，才能传达到工地。后来，指挥部的负责干部从苏联小说“远离莫斯科的地方”中受到启示，立即加强了通讯设备，每天，通过电话传达指挥部的意图，了解各个工地工作情况。这样，全长三百七十公里线路工程，完全变成一个呼吸相应的整体，到十月三十日晚上，全部混凝土工程胜利完工了。二
    十一月，东北完全封冻了。平地的雪都有膝盖深，高山上的雪更厚。工人们在雪地上开始安装铁塔的工作。
    这九百一十九座铁塔，都是螺丝结构。塔型共有十种，最高的有四十六公尺，重十六点四吨。铁塔中心线误差不能超过千分之一，有的不能超过两千分之一。
    组装铁塔是把多少块不同形式的钢板对起来，看起来好像并不难，但是做起来却不是那么容易。东北送变电工程公司绝大部分工人没有作过这个活，有些工人开始都不敢上铁塔上去。指挥部为了解决这个问题，在一九五三年一月份开始，开展了铁塔练兵运动，参加这个练兵运动的共有八百多工人。
    指挥部准备了六座铁塔钢材和六个铁塔模型。职工们每天一早起来，就分组练习组装铁塔，他们好像小孩子玩积木似的，垒一个样子，哗啦哗啦拆掉再垒，就这样拆了垒上，垒上又拆了。上午反复组装几次后，下午工程技术人员分别参加各小组开会讨论，研究组装方法中的优点和缺点，提出需要改进的地方，于是第二天又用另一种办法组装。老工人苏云龙等三人，白天和大家一块学习组装，晚上他们把模型搬到宿舍里研究。过去曾参加过伪满修建超高压送电线工程的老技工杨兆清，白天黑夜琢磨，他根据苏联“整体立塔法”的先进经验，又根据工地的地理条件，创造出了“双抱杆整体立塔法”。有的小组在技术人员的帮助下，研究创造了
  “分解立塔法”等组装铁塔方法。工人的创造精神和工程技术人员的理论结合起来，就变成了无穷无尽的力量。通过短短两个月的学习，绝大多数工人都掌握了组装铁塔的技术，这给正式安装工程打下了有力的基础。
    正式安装工程开始以前，指挥部又集中了全线路的工地主任、班长、组长、老技术工人共一百多人，选择了不同的塔型，不同的现场，先组装三座铁塔，使大家进一步熟悉操作规程，掌握质量标准。“试点”结束后，全面展开了组塔工程。
    凛冽的西北风卷着雪片，像针一样地刺在人们的身上。工人们为了争取时间，白天晚上连续工作。他们的汗水浸到棉衣外面，很快结成薄冰；体温又把薄冰融化，水柱不断沿着皮肤流下来。但他们靠着一颗火热的心，战胜了风雪和严寒。有一次，孙克俭班的工人，刚刚走到工地上，天下雪了，越下越大。党支部书记劝大家停止工作，他们说： “下尖刀也挡不住我们，什么时候装完这座铁塔，什么时候回去！”指导施工的工程技术人员和工人一起，白天黑夜坚持工作。
    开始时组装铁塔的效率不高，一般型的铁塔要用三天时间，结构复杂的特殊型的铁塔就要用五六天。职工们为了提高工作效率，创造了不少先进工作方法。孙克俭班的工人们创造了平行流水作业法、交叉流水作业法，大大提高了工作效率。他们班原计划组装十四座铁塔，结果他们组装了十八座，超额完成了任务。
    王喜春领导的组塔班，在工地分散、人力不足、技术条件很低的情况下，保证完成了任务。开始，组里临时工人不懂得螺丝尺寸，往往拿错了影响工作进度，王喜春就和老技工一起研究，把螺丝分别堆成堆，再标上一、二、三……记号，这样大大提高了工作效率。他们又研究创造了“双绳绑抱法”，过去组装二十五点六公尺高的某种型铁塔时，需要两三天，采用这个办法，只用九小时就装完了。因此，他们班连续两次获得优胜班的光荣红旗。
    在这些先进人物和先进小组的带动下，组装铁塔工程效率迅速提高了，由开始三天组装一座提高到平均每天组装一座，一些结构复杂的特殊型的铁塔，也由开始五六天组装一座提高到三天组装一座。整个组装铁塔工程，实际只用了一个半月的时间，质量完全合乎国家要求的标准。三
    架线是全部工程最后的一个环节。在复杂的地形上，零下三、四十度的严寒中，实行高空作业，架设三条沉重的甘蔗一样粗的钢心铝线，当然不是一件容易的事情。在试作以前，指挥部曾组织架线的干部和工人学习了苏联“空中放线法”、“三线紧线法”等先进经验。当时有些老技术工人认为地形太坏，同时架设三条线，简直作不到。伪满时期，日本侵略者修筑松抚送电线路时，是把线放在地上，然后再往上吊，架了一条架一条。但是，钢心铝线一卷就有一千二百公尺长，两千四百吨重，如果采用旧的架线方法，既浪费人力，又浪费时间；而且，铝皮很软，采用旧的架线法，很容易把铝碰伤磨坏，采用苏联的先进经验，就完全可以避免这些缺点。
    架线工程开始后，全线立刻紧张起来。放线工人一个挨一个地，排成三行，拉着钢心铝线，小心地不让它挨着地面。架线工人按照苏联先进经验，在铁塔上安装了“四轮滑车”把线放在滑车上；拖拉机手开动了机器，机器轰隆轰隆地运动着，牵引着钢心铝线慢慢前进。压接工人早准备好“水压机”，在工程技术人员指导下，压接钢心铝线的接头。紧线组的工人们拿着“弛度板”和“经纬仪”，仔细测量电线弧度。
    在严冬实行高空作业，那是很困难的事。工人们虽然戴了手套，但是还没有爬到铁塔的一半，双手就失去知觉了，他们就把“安全带”或“安全筐”挂到铁塔上，承担起全身的重量，然后放开双手搓一搓，再继续往上爬。架线组的工人爬上铁塔，还必须爬到悬垂在铁塔上的一串串的磁瓶上工作，正如工人们开玩笑时说的：真像杂技团的演员走钢丝一样。但他们是架钢线，全身用“安全带”或“安全筐”吊在铁塔上，只能上身动，下身却不能动，这样一连工作四、五小时，上半身汗水淋漓，两条腿早冻僵了。就这样，他们在七十三天的短时间内，在保证质量、保证安全的基础上，全部完成了架线工程。四一月二十四日的晚上，星星布满了天空，大地一片寂静，人们早已睡熟了。可是，建筑二十二万伏超高压送电线工程的全体职工，却紧张地、兴奋地在辽阔的雪地上等待着。此刻，丰满的电力就要通过这条线路输送到南满去。指挥部为了防备万一发生事故，还组织了十个抢修队。这时，工地上三个人一堆，五个人一伙，有的在兴奋地交谈着，有的在镇静地等待着，年青的工人们在跳着唱着。午夜十二点钟，高空电线响起了“唰、唰”的声音，人们高声欢呼“电来了”，“电来了”，几百双眼睛在瞅着电线，抢修队的工人们，个个都在紧张地检查着，但是，他们没有发现一个冒火的地方。职工们笑了，他们胜利了！（附图片）超高压送电线竣工，施工单位和生产单位正在进行验收。
