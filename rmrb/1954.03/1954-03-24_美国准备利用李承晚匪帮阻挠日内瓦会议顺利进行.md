    Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: The US authorities are stepping up their collusion with the Syngman Rhee clique to plot disruption of the Geneva Conference. A spokesman for Syngman Rhee's Foreign Ministry said on the 20th that the US and Rhee had agreed to withdraw from the conference ninety days after it began. A message from Washington indicates that US Secretary of State Dulles has written to Syngman Rhee on this issue, offering "assurance" that the United States will impose the illegal, one-sided agreement between the US and Rhee, which stipulates a ninety-day limit for the Korean political conference, on the Geneva Conference. Dulles also assured that the United States would respect the "vital interests" of Syngman Rhee, who constantly clamors for a "northward march." According to Byun Young-tae, the Foreign Minister of Syngman Rhee, the Syngman Rhee group is still "discussing" "other issues" related to the Geneva Conference with the United States. The "discussion" between the United States and Syngman Rhee is clearly to make multifaceted preparations to obstruct the smooth progress of the conference. At the same time, the US ruling group's newspapers openly encouraged Syngman Rhee. An editorial in the "New York Times" even stated that Syngman Rhee's demand to "unify" Korea "is not unreasonable." These circumstances prove that the US authorities are clearly instigating and using Syngman Rhee to continuously create obstacles to the discussion of a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference.

    美国准备利用李承晚匪帮阻挠日内瓦会议顺利进行
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国当局正在加紧勾结李承晚集团预谋捣乱日内瓦会议。李承晚的外务部发言人二十日说，美李之间已协议要在日内瓦会议举行九十天之后退出会议。来自华盛顿的消息表明，美国国务卿杜勒斯已致函李承晚就这一问题提出“保证”，表示美国将把美李之间给朝鲜政治会议规定九十天期限的非法的片面协议强加于日内瓦会议之上。杜勒斯还保证美国将尊重不断叫嚣“向北进军”的李承晚的“切身利益”。据李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰说，目前李承晚集团还在和美国“讨论”有关日内瓦会议的“其他问题”。美国和李承晚的“讨论”，显然是要进行多方面的准备以阻挠会议的顺利进行。同时，美国统治集团的报纸公开给李承晚以鼓励，“纽约时报”的社论甚至表示，由李承晚来“统一”朝鲜的要求“并不是不合理的”。这些情况证明，美国当局显然是要唆使并利用李承晚来给日内瓦会议上关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论不断制造障碍。
