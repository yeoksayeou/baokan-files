    Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill Actively Prepares for Construction

    The construction of the integrated paper mill in Jiamusi City by the Central Ministry of Light Industry will be carried out on a large scale this year. The total workload, calculated by investment amount, will increase sixfold compared to last year. Among them, the modern copper wire mesh factory project is expected to start construction in early June this year and will complete all equipment installation within the year. It will be put into production in the first quarter of next year.

    The copper wire mesh factory was designed with the help of the Soviet government. It concentrates the advantages of existing copper wire mesh factories in the Soviet Union and adopts modern wire mesh manufacturing methods. The production process of wire mesh is fully mechanized and automated.

    In order to ensure that the project is constructed on schedule and completed successfully, the Jiamusi Integrated Paper Mill Preparatory Office and the Engineering Department of the Central Ministry of Light Industry are actively carrying out various preparatory tasks before construction. At present, the factory site has been determined and leveling and surveying are underway; some foreign design drawings have arrived and engineering and technical personnel are studying them; national balanced materials have been calculated and allocated, and more than 80 percent of local materials have arrived; orders for various equipment are being shipped from home and abroad one after another.

    The construction of the copper wire mesh factory marks the development of China's paper industry. In the past, China did not have a copper wire mesh factory, and the copper wire mesh needed by paper mills across the country relied on imports from abroad. After the copper wire mesh factory is built, we will use domestic raw materials to manufacture various specifications of very precise copper wire mesh, ensuring supply to paper mills across the country, producing various high-quality industrial and cultural papers, which will play a significant role in the development of China's industrial and cultural construction.

    佳木斯综合造纸厂积极准备施工
    中央轻工业部在佳木斯市建设的综合造纸厂工程，今年将大规模进行施工，总工程量按投资额计算比去年增加六倍。其中现代化铜网厂工程预计在今年六月上旬开始施工，将在年内完成全部设备安装工程，明年第一季度即可投入生产。
    铜网厂是苏联政府帮助我国设计的，集中了苏联现有的铜网厂的优点，采用了现代化的制网方法。制网的生产过程，全部是机械化、自动化的。
    为了保证该项工程按期施工并顺利完成，佳木斯综合造纸厂筹备处、中央轻工业部工程处，正积极进行施工前各项准备工作。目前，厂址已确定，正在进行抄平测量；部分国外设计图纸已到，工程技术人员正进行学习；国家平衡材料已计算调拨，地方材料已到达百分之八十以上；各种设备订货正陆续从国内、外运到。
    铜网厂的建筑标志着我国造纸工业的发展。过去，我国没有铜网厂，国内各地造纸厂所需用的铜网，都是依靠国外进口。这座铜网厂建成后，我们将用国内原料制造各种规格的、非常精密的铜网，保证供应全国各地造纸厂需要，制成各种质量优良的工业和文化用纸，对我国工业、文化建设发展将起很大作用。（国华）
