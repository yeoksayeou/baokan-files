    The situation reflected by readers Qian Yige and Tian Chunsheng, where over four thousand tons of steel have been stored outdoors for more than three years, reflects a seriously irresponsible attitude on the part of the relevant authorities towards state property. This batch of steel was requisitioned by the Ministry of Heavy Industry from the former East China Warehouse Materials Clearing and Transfer Branch in 1950, originally weighing over five thousand tons (over eight hundred tons have been requisitioned by relevant units), with a value of over 360 billion yuan. Later, the Ministry of Heavy Industry considered the valuation to be too high and that the steel composition was mixed and difficult to identify, and requested an adjustment in price. After a meeting convened by responsible comrades of the Ministry of Finance in April 1952, it was decided to devalue it to over 40 billion yuan. However, the Ministry of Heavy Industry did not promptly organize technical personnel to analyze and identify this batch of steel and dispose of it. In September 1952, the Ministry of Heavy Industry underwent organizational changes. Due to unclear transfer procedures and departments passing the buck, no one took responsibility, causing this batch of steel to continue to be stockpiled. Admittedly, at the beginning of the restructuring of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and personnel changes, there were certain difficulties in quickly processing this batch of steel. However, more than a year after the organizational restructuring, it was possible to cooperate with relevant authorities to jointly handle it.
    Cherishing public property is the public morality of all people, and state workers should be models of cherishing public property. In his report "On the Tasks of Party Organizations in Industry and Transportation," Malenkov pointed out: "Paying attention to protecting state property—buildings, houses, equipment, tools, and all materials entrusted to enterprises—is the primary responsibility of leaders, engineers, workers, and employees of our factories, railways, and waterways." He severely criticized the "criminal attitude towards state wealth" of "throwing away equipment, raw materials, materials, and tools urgently needed by industry everywhere, allowing them to be destroyed, rust, and become waste." Steel is a valuable material urgently needed by our industry. Stockpiling large amounts of steel for a long time prevents them from playing their proper role in production, and they suffer huge losses due to poor storage. This phenomenon is intolerable.
    Readers Qian Yige and Tian Chunsheng have continuously exposed and criticized this behavior of not cherishing state property, and reported the situation to this newspaper in December last year, actively playing the role of people's supervision correspondents. After receiving the letters from Qian Yige and Tian Chunsheng, this newspaper contacted the Central People's Supervisory Committee, the State Materials Reserve Bureau of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Central First Ministry of Machine Building. Now, under the supervision of the Central People's Supervisory Committee, although the relevant units are responsible for handling this batch of materials, the Central People's Supervisory Committee should also investigate the huge losses of state property caused in the past and the responsibilities of the relevant units, so that the staff of the relevant units can truly learn from this event and improve their future work.
    As we understand it, at present, among our state workers, taking a careless and non-master attitude towards state property, resulting in the accumulation of valuable equipment and materials urgently needed for industrial production, is not an isolated case. People's supervisory organs and all people's supervision correspondents in various places should learn from the spirit of Qian Yige and Tian Chunsheng, who are concerned about the interests of the country and adhere to correct criticism, to overcome this phenomenon that endangers the cause of national construction, so that supervisory work can play its due role in safeguarding national economic construction and ensuring the realization of the general line.

### 向不爱护国家物资的行为作斗争

    向不爱护国家物资的行为作斗争
    读者钱义格、田椿生所反映的四千多吨钢材露天存放三年多的情况，反映了有关机关对国家财产严重不负责任的态度。这批钢材是重工业部在一九五○年向前华东仓库物资清调分会领用的，原重五千余吨（已由有关单位陆续领用了八百余吨），核价三千六百余亿元。后来重工业部认为作价过高，并且钢材成份混乱，不易鉴别，要求调整价格，经财政部负责同志在一九五二年四月召集会议，决定贬价作值为四百余亿元。但是，重工业部却没有及时组织技术人员对这批钢材进行分析鉴定，加以处理。一九五二年九月，重工业部机构变动，由于移办手续不清，有关部门间互相推来推去，无人负责，又使这批钢材继续积压下去。固然，在重工业部机构改组、人事更调之初，要迅速处理这批钢材是存在着一定的困难，但在机构改组一年多以后，是可以协同有关机关共同来进行处理的。
    爱护公共财物是全体人民的公德，国家工作人员更应该成为爱护公物的模范。马林科夫在“关于党组织在工业和运输业方面的任务”的报告中指出：“注意保护国家财产——建筑物、房屋、设备、工具和一切托交企业的物资，是我国工厂、铁路和水上运输的领导者、工程师、工人和职员的头等责任。”他严厉地批评了把“工业所迫切需要的设备、原料、材料、工具……到处乱扔，任其破坏、生锈而成为废物”的这种“对国家财富的罪恶态度”。钢材，正是我国工业所迫切需要的贵重材料。把大量的钢材长期积压，使它们不能在生产中发挥应有的作用，并且因为保管不善而遭受了巨大损失。这种现象是令人不能容忍的。
    对于这种不爱护国家财产的行为，读者钱义格、田椿生不断地进行了揭露和批评，并在去年十二月把情况向本报反映，积极发挥了人民监察通讯员的作用。本报在接到钱义格、田椿生来信后，即分别与中央人民监察委员会、中央财政经济委员会国家物资储备局、中央重工业部、中央第一机械工业部联系。现在，经中央人民监察委员会督促，虽然有关单位正在对这批物资负责进行处理，但是，对于过去造成国家财产巨大损失的情况以及有关单位应负的责任，中央人民监察委员会还应该进行检查，使有关单位的工作人员真正从这一事件中吸取教训，改进今后工作。
    据我们了解，目前在我们国家工作人员中，对国家财产采取漠不关心和非主人翁的态度，以致积压工业生产所迫切需要的贵重设备、材料等的情况，还不是个别的。各地人民监察机关和所有人民监察通讯员都应该学习钱义格、田椿生这种关心国家利益、坚持正确批评的精神，以克服这种危害国家建设事业的现象，使监察工作对维护国家经济建设、保证总路线的实现起应有的作用。
