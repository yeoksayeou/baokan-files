The Yancheng County Cooperative Union in Jiangsu Province, in assisting grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to organize the supply of farm tools, has strengthened its leadership over the integration of production and sales, enabling the cooperative's farm tool supply work to better serve agricultural production.

In mid-January, the Yancheng County Union of Cooperatives held a meeting of directors from supply and marketing cooperatives and farm tool production cooperatives. At the meeting, starting from improving the ideology of cooperative cadres, the shortcomings of last year's production materials supply work were summarized. Through self-criticism and mutual criticism, the cooperative's business principles and tasks were clarified, and the issue of integrating production and sales was studied and discussed.

After the meeting, the supply and marketing cooperatives in each district successively convened meetings of directors from grassroots cooperatives in each district, further criticizing the erroneous thinking of neglecting the supply of production materials in the past and the subjective working style of not investigating and studying the needs of the masses in supply work. At the same time, symposiums were held with agricultural production mutual aid teams and veteran farmers to investigate the needs of the masses. The County Union of Cooperatives also cooperated with the Qinnan Supply and Marketing Cooperative to conduct in-depth investigations and research in the Song Lianfu mutual aid team. Through investigation and research, the required quantities and specifications of various farm tools were understood, providing excellent material for the cooperative to improve its work in the future.

After the Yancheng County Cooperative Union led the supply and marketing cooperatives in conducting investigation and research, it led and organized the source of goods based on the existing production capacity of farm tool production cooperatives and the local handicraft production situation. All fifty-two supply and marketing cooperatives and five farm tool production cooperatives in the county signed production-sales integration contracts for more than 900,000 various farm tools, worth more than 1.1 billion yuan. Because the supply and marketing cooperatives still lacked a portion of their supply, six groups of scattered handicraftsmen were organized to process and order farm tools. Under the leadership and coordination of the County Union of Cooperatives, the farm tool production cooperatives purchased raw materials such as miscellaneous trees, iron materials, and wood from Gaoyou, Baoying, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other places. The County Union of Cooperatives also ordered more than 5,500 farm tools such as colter heads and tip sets from the Jianghuai Farm Tool Factory. Currently, the five farm tool production cooperatives have produced more than 250,000 various farm tools, preparing well for the supply of farm tools during spring plowing production.

    盐城合作社联社帮助基层社组织农具供应
    江苏省盐城县合作社联合社，在帮助基层供销合作社组织农具供应工作中，加强对产销结合工作的领导，使合作社农具供应工作能更好地为农业生产服务。
    盐城县联合社在一月中旬举行了供销合作社和农具生产合作社主任会议。会上，从提高合作社干部的思想着手，总结了去年生产资料供应工作的缺点。经过自我批评和相互批评，明确了合作社的经营方针和任务，研究和讨论了产销结合问题。
    会后，各区供销合作社，先后召开了各区基层合作社主任会议，进一步批判了过去不重视生产资料供应的错误思想和在供应工作上不调查研究群众需要的主观主义作风。同时，还分别召开农业生产互助组和老农座谈会，调查群众需要。县联合社也配合秦南供销合作社，重点深入宋连福互助组，进行了深入的调查研究。经过调查研究，知道了各种农具的需要量和规格，这些都为合作社改进今后工作提供了很好的材料。
    盐城县合作社联合社领导各供销合作社进行调查研究工作以后，又根据现有农具生产合作社的生产能力和当地手工业生产情况，领导和组织货源工作。全县五十二个供销合作社和五个农具生产合作社，签订了各种农具九十多万件的产销结合合同，价值十一亿元以上。因为各供销合作社尚缺少一部分货源，又组织了分散手工业者成立六个小组，进行农具的加工订货。各农具生产合作社，又在县联合社的领导和配合下， 向高邮、宝应、浙江、上海等地，购买了杂树、铁料、木头等原料。县联合社并向江淮农具厂订购了镵头、套尖等农具五千五百多件。目前，五个农具生产合作社，已生产各种农具二十五万多件，为春耕生产中农具的供应作好了准备。
