Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 18th: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on March 18th, the Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, listed the facts and sternly reprimanded the US side for openly violating the provisions of Article 13, Paragraph D of the Armistice Agreement by refusing to report to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the parts and disassembled components of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition that the US side transported into Korea. He also condemned the US side for illegally transporting a large number of reinforcement war materiel in the form of parts and disassembled components.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition could be disassembled and transported into Korea and then reassembled. The transportation of parts and disassembled components of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition could also change or improve the performance of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition already in Korea. Therefore, to ensure the strict implementation of Article 13, Paragraph D of the Armistice Agreement, the transportation of these war materiel parts and disassembled components into Korea should, of course, be reported to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and be subject to their supervision. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has already issued working instructions to each team based on the above provisions of the Armistice Agreement. The Korean and Chinese side has always strictly abided by this provision of the Armistice Agreement. However, the US side has violated the Armistice Agreement by refusing to report the transportation of parts and disassembled components of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, while at the same time transporting a large amount of reinforcement war materiel in the form of parts and disassembled components.

According to the actually extremely incomplete materials discovered by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at US-side ports, from August 1953 to February 1954, the US side transported more than 1.1 million pounds of warplane and tank parts through five ports without ever reporting to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. From the time these teams began working in August 1953 to November 30, 1953 alone, the parts and disassembled components transported by the US side through five ports and discovered by the teams were sufficient to assemble a considerable number of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, or improve their performance. This included at least more than 5,000 0.3-inch caliber machine guns, more than 100 155mm howitzers, 35 105mm howitzers, 40 106.7mm mortars, 37 jet warplanes, and complete disassembled sets for 106 4.2-inch caliber mortars.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out that the US side's illegal transportation of a large amount of reinforcement war materiel in the form of parts and disassembled components was clearly intended to intensify the arming of the South Korean army in order to increase the US military strength in Korea, so as to maintain and deepen international tensions. In fact, the US side has publicly announced that since the armistice, the US side has newly established four divisions for the South Korean government. US Commander-in-Chief Hull also publicly admitted in Washington this February 18th that the US strength in Korea has increased.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao finally solemnly pointed out at the meeting that in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the stability of the Korean armistice, the US side must immediately provide a responsible account of the parts and disassembled components of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition illegally transported into Korea since the armistice, and should, from this day forward, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, report the transportation of parts and disassembled components of warplanes, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    李相朝将军在军事停战委员会上
    斥美方拒不交代非法运入朝鲜的作战物资
    【新华社开城十八日电】在三月十八日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将列举事实，严词斥责美方公然违反停战协定第十三款卯项的规定，拒绝向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告美方运入朝鲜的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的零件与拆散件等，并非法地以零件与拆散件等方式大量运入增援性的作战物资。
    李相朝中将指出：作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药，是可以拆散运进朝鲜而又重新装配起来的。作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的零件与拆散件等的运入，也可以改变或改进已在朝鲜的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的性能。因此，为保证停战协定第十三款卯项的严格实施，这些作战物资的零件与拆散件等的运入朝鲜，当然应向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告，并受它们的监督。中立国监察委员会已经根据停战协定的上述规定，对各小组发出工作指示。朝中方面一向严格遵守停战协定的这一规定。但美方却违反停战协定，拒不报告作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的零件与拆散件等的运入，同时则以零件、拆散件等方式大量运入增援性的作战物资。
    根据驻美方地区各口岸的中立国视察小组所发现的、实际上极不完全的材料，自一九五三年八月到一九五四年二月，美方就经由五个口岸运进了作战飞机和坦克的零件一百一十万磅以上，从未向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会提出报告。仅自一九五三年八月这些小组开始工作之时起，至一九五三年十一月三十日止，美方经由五个口岸运入而被小组查出的零件与拆散件等，就可以装配相当数量的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药，或改进它们的性能。其中至少包括有零点三英寸口径的机关枪五千多挺、一五五公厘的榴弹炮一百多门、一零五公厘榴弹炮三十五门、一零六点七公厘的迫击炮四十门、喷气式作战飞机三十七架和一百零六门四点二英寸口径的迫击炮的全套拆散件。
    李相朝中将指出：美方这种非法地以零件与拆散件等方式大量运入增援性作战物资，显然是用以加紧武装南朝鲜军队来增加美方在朝鲜的军事力量，以便保持并加深国际紧张局势。事实上，美方已经公开宣布：自停战以来，美方已为南朝鲜政府新建立了四个师。美方总司令赫尔今年二月十八日也在华盛顿公开承认：美方在朝鲜的力量已经增加。
    李相朝中将最后在会上严正指出：为保证朝鲜停战协定的切实实施和朝鲜停战的稳定，美方必须立即就停战以来美方非法运进朝鲜的属于作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的零件、拆散件等作负责的交代，并应自即日起遵照停战协定的规定，就属于作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器和弹药的零件、拆散件等的运入，向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会提出报告。
