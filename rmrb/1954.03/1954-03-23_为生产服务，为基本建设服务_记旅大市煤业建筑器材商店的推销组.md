    Serving Production, Serving Basic Construction
    ——On the Promotion Group of the Lushun-Dalian City Coal Industry Building Materials Store
    Xu Xian
    The Lushun-Dalian City Coal Industry Building Materials Company's Building Materials Store has achieved good results in promoting the advanced experience of the factory-mine-construction site contact system. This is mainly because the promoters have clearly established the idea of "serving production and serving basic construction," expanded promotion, and ensured supply, thus gaining the praise of factories, mines, and construction sites.

    In early 1953, with the development of production and the increasing needs of basic construction, the task of building materials management also increased. The Building Materials Store began to equip full-time promoters to be responsible for contacting various factories, mines, and construction sites. However, the main purpose at that time was "promoting goods," and there was a lack of organization and leadership. In order to "complete tasks," the promoters went to units that used goods frequently and in large quantities, resulting in mutual competition and very bad effects. Units that didn't use goods frequently or used them in small quantities were ignored. As a result, some commodities were overstocked, while others were out of stock.

    Learning from this lesson, the Building Materials Store strengthened organization and leadership from the second quarter. A system of contracting by unit was implemented according to the nature of the factories, mines, and construction sites—basic construction, production factories and mines, production cooperatives, furniture stores, free markets, etc. In this way, the phenomenon of mutual confrontation and competition disappeared, but since the purpose of contacting factories, mines, and construction sites was still simply to "promote goods" and "complete tasks," and the help of the planning departments of the units was not well obtained, the promoters still could not figure out the needs of the factories and mines, and the organization of goods was still inaccurate. The phenomenon of simultaneous overstocking and out of stock still existed.

    How to deeply understand the needs of factories and mines and sell more goods? This was a major issue that promoters considered every day.

    The promoter Lin Fufang was responsible for contacting the Fourth Engineering Team of the Mechanical Bureau. However, because he did not understand the needs of the engineering team, sales had not opened up. Coincidentally, one day, Lin Fufang overheard the purchasing agent reporting to the materials section chief. It turned out that the engineering team urgently needed 50 tons of two-meter-long pillars, and they couldn't buy them anywhere, and they were about to stop work waiting for materials, which worried the materials section chief. Lin Fufang suddenly remembered: the Sino-Soviet Shipyard had a surplus of 60 tons of pillars that had been overstocked for more than two years, and they were worried about how to deal with them. The last time he went there, they asked him to sell them. He quickly ran to the Sino-Soviet Shipyard, and naturally, it was easy to reach an agreement. Not only were the pillars purchased in full quantity, but the price was also cheap. When he told the purchasing agent and the materials section chief of the Fourth Engineering Team this news, they were overjoyed. From then on, the engineering team looked for him for whatever materials they needed.

    The situation encountered by promoter Wang De'en at the Railway Factory was similar. Once, he discovered that the factory urgently needed 150 tons of foundry clay, and if it wasn't supplied, 200 workers would have to stop work. This commodity was not managed by the Coal Construction Company, and there were difficulties in procurement and transportation. Wang De'en took the railway factory purchasing agent Wang Diankui to look for it everywhere, and after a lot of effort, they finally found it in Shihe. However, because the ground had just thawed, the farmers were unwilling to dig it up. Wang De'en went to see the village chief, explained the situation clearly, and obtained the assistance of local leaders to mobilize the farmers to dig it up as required. However, the riverbed was muddy and large trucks could not pull it up. Wang De'en took the lead in paving the road, and his feet and legs were frozen stiff until 1:00 am when the clay was transported to the factory. When the materials section chief of the factory saw Wang De'en, he shook his hand tightly and said, "You truly deserve to be called a servant of the people!" After that, the factory told Wang De'en all their monthly procurement plans after they were determined.

    At the beginning of the third quarter, the Lushun-Dalian City People's Government Commercial Bureau convened a meeting to promote the experience of contacting factories and mines. Director Li called on promoters to serve production and serve basic construction. After the meeting, the leaders of the Coal Construction Company paid more attention to this work, and added another promoter. The store director personally led the promotion team, and established team meetings and contact factory and mine record books. The enthusiasm of the promoters also increased. The idea of serving production and serving basic construction became even clearer.

    Once, the Hardware General Factory was building an important project and found that it was short of 50 tons of cement. It was too late to request temporary allocation, and the Coal Construction Company had no goods. Seeing that it was about to affect construction, they asked Lin Fufang for help. Lin Fufang learned that the Fourth Engineering Team of the Mechanical Bureau had a surplus of cement, so he went to discuss it. After they and the engineers calculated carefully, they extracted 230 tons of cement and gave it all to Lin Fufang. Not only did they supply the urgent needs of national construction, but they also adjusted other needs. Afterwards, the Hardware General Factory sent a special representative to the Coal Construction Company to thank them.

    These vivid deeds spread quickly through factories and mines, through construction sites, and through newspapers. Many factories and mines took the initiative to seek their advice and help in dealing with any difficulties or shortages of materials.

    As a result of promoting the responsibility system of contacting factories, mines, and construction sites, the needs were clarified, and the preparation of plans had a sufficient basis. When discussing the plan in July 1953, reliable basis accounted for 40%, increasing to 82% in October, and nearly 90% in December (including the service team and counter surveys), ensuring the completion of the national plan and meeting the needs of factories and mines. From the second quarter, they completed and overfulfilled the plan every month. Wang De'en sold 5.3 billion yuan worth of goods alone in the fourth quarter, which played a decisive role in completing the plan. He was rated as an advanced service worker of the company.

    为生产服务，为基本建设服务
    ——记旅大市煤业建筑器材商店的推销组

    旅大市煤业建筑器材公司建筑器材商店在推广厂矿工地联系制的先进经验中收到了良好效果。主要是由于推销员明确树立了“为生产服务，为基本建设服务”的思想，扩大了推销，保证了供应，因而得到了厂矿工地的好评。一
    一九五三年初，随着生产的发展和基本建设需要的增长，建筑器材经营的任务也加重了。建筑器材商店就开始配备了专职推销员负责与各厂矿工地联系。但当时主要目的是“推销商品”，缺乏组织与领导。推销员为了“完成任务”，看哪个单位常用货，用的多，便都到哪里去，互相竞争，影响很坏。哪个单位不常用，或用的少，就谁也不去。结果，有的商品积压，有的商品脱销。
    接受这一教训，建筑器材商店从第二季度起加强了组织与领导。按厂矿工地的性质——基本建设、生产厂矿、生产合作社、家具店、自由市场等，实行分单位包干制。这样，互相碰头、互相竞争的现象没有了，但由于联系厂矿工地的目的仍然是单纯为了“推销商品”“完成任务”，没有很好地取得各单位计划部门的帮助，推销员对厂矿的需要还是摸不清，货源组织仍不准确，一面积压，一面脱销现象仍然存在。二怎样才能深入了解厂矿需要，多卖货？这是推销员天天考虑的一件大事。
    推销员林福芳担负着与机械局第四工程队联系的任务。可是由于不了解该工程队需要，销路一直没有打开，可巧，有一天采买员向材料股长汇报的情况叫林福芳听到了。原来该工程急需二公尺长立柱五十吨，到处买也没买到，眼看就要停工待料，把材料股长急坏了。林福芳忽然想起来：中苏造船厂剩余有六十吨立柱已经压了两年多，正愁没法处理，上次他去时还托他给卖，这回可找到机会了。他便飞快地跑到中苏造船厂去，自然很容易就谈妥了。不但如数买到，而且价钱便宜，当他把这消息告诉第四工程队采买员和材料股长时，可把他们乐坏了。从此，该工程队用什么材料都去找他了。
    推销员王德恩在铁路工厂碰到的情况也和这个情况类似。有一次他发现该厂急需翻砂粘土一百五十吨，供应不上就会有二百名工人要停工。这种商品煤建公司并不经营，在采购运输上都有困难。王德恩就带着铁路工厂采购员王殿奎四处去找，费了很大的劲终于在石河找到了。但是因为地刚化冻，农民都不愿挖，王德恩就到村里去见村长，把情况交代清楚，取得了地方领导的协助，动员农民如数挖出来。可是河道泥泞，大汽车拉不上来，王德恩又带头下去垫道，把脚和腿都冻僵了，直到半夜一点钟才把粘土运到工厂。该厂材料科长一见王德恩就紧紧地握着他的手说：“你真不愧是人民的勤务员！”此后该厂每月采购计划确定后就全部告诉王德恩。三
    第三季度初，旅大市人民政府商业局召开了推广联系厂矿经验会议，李局长号召推销员要为生产服务，为基本建设服务。会后煤建公司领导上更加重视了这一工作，又增加了一名推销员，由商店主任亲自领导推销小组，并建立了小组碰头会、联系厂矿记录簿，推销员的工作热情也随之高涨。为生产服务，为基本建设服务的思想也越发明确了。
    有一次五金总厂修建一项重要工程，发觉水泥缺了五十吨，临时请求调拨又来不及，煤建公司也没有货，眼看就要影响建设，他们就要求林福芳帮助。林福芳打听到机械局第四工程队水泥有富余，就去商量。经他们和工程师细算了一下，抽出了二百三十吨水泥，全部交给林福芳了。不但供应了国家建设急需，而且调剂了其他需要，事后，五金总厂特派代表到煤建公司去感谢。
    这些生动事迹，通过厂矿、通过工地、通过报纸很快地传播出去了。不少厂矿工地一碰到什么困难，缺少什么材料，就都主动来找他们研究处理。四
    推广联系厂矿工地责任制的结果，摸清了需要，编制计划有了充分依据。一九五三年七月份讨论计划时可靠根据占百分之四十，十月份即增至百分之八十二，十二月就将近百分之九十了（包括服务小组和柜台调查在内），保证了国家计划的完成，满足了厂矿需要。从第二季度，他们月月都完成和超额完成了计划。王德恩第四季度一个人就卖了五十三亿元，在完成计划上起了决定作用，被评为该公司的先进服务员。
