Order of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Implementing the Planned Purchase and Planned Supply of Grain
(Passed at the 194th meeting of the State Council on November 19, 1953)

In order to guarantee the grain needed for the people's livelihood and national construction, stabilize grain prices, eliminate grain speculation, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, in accordance with Article 28 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "all enterprises related to the national economic lifeline and sufficient to manipulate the people's livelihood shall be operated uniformly by the state," it is decided to implement the planned purchase (hereinafter referred to as unified purchase) and planned supply (hereinafter referred to as unified sale) of grain in a planned and step-by-step manner nationwide, and the methods are stipulated as follows:

I. Farmers who produce grain shall sell their surplus grain to the state according to the grain types, purchase prices, and planned purchase allocation quantities stipulated by the state. Farmers may freely store and use the surplus grain remaining after paying agricultural taxes and planned purchase grain, and may continue to sell it to state grain departments or cooperatives, or trade in state-established grain markets, and may conduct a small amount of mutual exchange of goods between rural areas.

II. When starting to implement the planned supply of grain, some simple and easy-to-implement methods can be stipulated first, and gradually researched and improved to make them perfect: (A) In cities, personnel of institutions, organizations, schools, enterprises, etc., can be supplied through their organizations; for ordinary citizens, grain purchase certificates can be issued to purchase grain with the certificate, or temporarily purchase grain with household registration booklets. (B) In market towns, economic crop areas, disaster areas, and general rural areas, a method of issuing control figures by higher-level governments combined with democratic appraisal by the masses should be adopted, so that genuine grain-deficient households can buy the grain they need, and at the same time, the sales volume of grain can be appropriately controlled to prevent speculation and hoarding. (C) For grain needed by the cooked food industry, the food industry, etc., grain for supplying meals to passengers in hotels, trains, ships, etc., and other industrial grain, the supply should be given according to the average demand in a certain period in the past, and private procurement is not allowed.

III. The control figures for planned purchase and planned supply should be appropriately stipulated according to the needs of the state and the people and the grain situation in rural areas: (A) The control figures for large administrative regions shall be stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council according to the national control figures compiled by the State Planning Commission. (B) The control figures for the three levels of provinces, special districts, and counties shall be stipulated by their higher-level governments. (C) The control figures for the two levels of districts and townships (villages) shall be stipulated by the county people's government. The control figures at the township (village) level should be publicly announced to the masses, and the masses should be led and organized to conduct democratic appraisal.

The types and specifications of grain for planned purchase shall be drafted by the provincial (municipal) people's governments and submitted to the large administrative region for approval and then forwarded to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for record.

IV. The prices for planned purchase of autumn grain this year are basically in accordance with the current purchase list prices; the prices for planned supply are currently basically in accordance with the current retail list prices. If the current purchase list prices and retail list prices are abnormally high or low and significantly prominent, appropriate adjustments should be made according to the following division of labor and procedures: (A) The Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council is responsible for reviewing and adjusting grain prices in cities controlled by the central government and formulating principles for adjusting grain prices. (B) The administrative committees of major administrative regions, the people's government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the people's governments of provinces (municipalities), the commissioner's offices (administrative offices), and the people's governments of counties are responsible for reviewing the grain prices in the towns and cities under their control in accordance with the principles formulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council, and drafting adjustment plans. The large administrative regions shall report to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for approval, the provinces (municipalities) shall report to the administrative committee of the large administrative region for approval, and the special districts and counties shall report to the provincial people's government for approval, and all shall be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for record.

V. All state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperative-run grain stores and factories related to grain management and grain processing shall be uniformly led by the local grain departments.

VI. All private grain merchants are not allowed to operate grain privately, but may be entrusted by the state grain department to act as agents for selling grain under strict state supervision and management. Various small miscellaneous grains (local non-staple miscellaneous grains) should also be operated uniformly by the state in principle. Before the state implements unified operation, private grain merchants may be temporarily allowed to operate under strict state supervision and management.

VII. All private grain processing factories and commercial soil mills and soil grinders are not allowed to purchase raw materials and sell finished products on their own. They can only be entrusted by the state grain department for processing or, under state supervision and management, engage in processing for consumers in accordance with the processing standards stipulated by the state.

VIII. If urban residents have surplus or insufficient grain purchased under the state's planned supply, or need to exchange grain types due to consumption habits, they can sell it to designated state stores or cooperatives, or go to state-established grain markets for mutual adjustment.

IX. In order to strengthen market management and eliminate speculation, governments at all levels should organize relevant departments to conduct regular inspections and supervision. Speculators who violate state laws must be severely punished; state personnel who engage in speculation and collude with or harbor speculators should be severely punished; counter-revolutionaries who undermine planned purchase and planned supply should be punished in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries.

X. The administrative committees of major administrative regions, the people's government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the people's governments of provinces (municipalities) should immediately formulate implementation methods based on the above provisions and with reference to the specific conditions of each region. The implementation methods of major administrative regions and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shall be reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for approval; the implementation methods of provinces (municipalities) shall be reported to the administrative committee of major administrative regions for approval and reported to the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council for record.

The above items should be complied with and implemented!

    中央人民政府政务院关于实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的命令
    （一九五三年十一月十九日政务院第一百九十四次政务会议通过）
    为了保证人民生活和国家建设所需要的粮食，稳定粮价，消灭粮食投机，进一步巩固工农联盟，特根据共同纲领第二十八条“凡属有关国家经济命脉和足以操纵国民生计的事业，均应由国家统一经营”的规定，决定在全国范围内有计划、有步骤地实行粮食的计划收购（简称统购）和计划供应（简称统销），并规定办法如下：
    一、生产粮食的农民应按国家规定的收购粮种、收购价格和计划收购的分配数量将余粮售给国家。农民在缴纳公粮和计划收购粮以外的余粮，可以自由存储和自由使用，可以继续售给国家粮食部门或合作社，或在国家设立的粮食市场进行交易，并可在农村间进行少量的互通有无的交易。
    二、开始实行粮食计划供应时，可先规定一些简便易行的办法，逐步研究改进，使之趋于完善：（甲）在城市，对机关、团体、学校、企业等的人员，可通过其组织，进行供应；对一般市民，可发给购粮证，凭证购买，或暂凭户口簿购买。（乙）在集镇、经济作物区、灾区及一般农村，则应采取由上级政府颁发控制数字并由群众实行民主评议相结合的办法，使真正的缺粮户能够买到所需要的粮食，而又能适当控制粮食的销量，防止投机和囤积。（丙）对于熟食业、食品工业等所需粮食，旅店、火车、轮船等供应旅客膳食用粮，及其他工业用粮，应参照过去一定时期的平均需用量，定额给予供应，不许私自采购。
    三、计划收购和计划供应的控制数字，应根据国家及人民需要和农村粮食情况作适当的规定：（甲）大行政区控制数字由政务院财政经济委员会根据国家计划委员会编制的全国控制数字规定。（乙）省、专、县三级控制数字，由其上一级政府规定。（丙）区、乡（村）两级控制数字由县人民政府规定。乡（村）一级控制数字应向群众公开宣布，并领导和组织群众进行民主评议。
    计划收购的粮食种类、规格，由省（市）人民政府拟定计划草案报大行政区批准，转报政务院财政经济委员会备案。
    四、今年秋粮计划收购的价格，基本上按照现行的收购牌价；计划供应的价格，目前基本上按照现行的零售牌价。现行收购牌价及零售牌价有畸高畸低而且显著突出者，应按照如下的分工和程序，作适当调整：（甲）政务院财政经济委员会负责审查、调整中央所掌握城市的粮食价格，并制定调整粮食价格的原则。（乙）各大行政区行政委员会、内蒙古自治区人民政府、各省（市）人民政府、各专员公署（行署）和各县人民政府，负责依据政务院财政经济委员会所制定的原则，各自审查其所掌握城镇的粮食价格，拟定调整方案，大行政区报政务院财政经济委员会批准，省（市）报大行政区行政委员会批准，专、县报省人民政府批准，并均层报政务院财政经济委员会备案。
    五、一切有关粮食经营和粮食加工的国营、地方国营、公私合营、合作社经营的粮店和工厂，统一归当地粮食部门领导。
    六、所有私营粮商一律不许私自经营粮食，但得在国家严格监督和管理下，由国家粮食部门委托代理销售粮食。各种小杂粮（当地非主食杂粮），原则上亦应由国家统一经营，在国家尚未实行统一经营以前，得在国家严格监督和管理下，暂准私营粮商经营。
    七、所有私营粮食加工厂及营业性的土碾、土磨，一律不得自购原料、自销成品，只能由国家粮食部门委托加工或在国家监督和管理下，代消费户按照国家规定的加工标准从事加工。
    八、城市居民购得国家计划供应的粮食，如有剩余或不足，或由于消费习惯关系，须作粮种间的调换时，可到指定的国家商店、合作社卖出，或到国家设立的粮食市场进行相互间的调剂。
    九、为了加强市场管理，取缔投机，各级政府应组织有关部门进行经常的检查和监督。对于违犯国家法令的投机分子，必须严予惩处；对进行投机和勾结、包庇投机分子的国家工作人员，应加重惩处；对破坏计划收购和计划供应的反革命分子，应依照中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例治罪。
    十、各大行政区行政委员会、内蒙古自治区人民政府、各省（市）人民政府应即根据以上各项规定，参照各地的具体情况制定实施办法。各大行政区和内蒙古自治区的实施办法报政务院财政经济委员会批准；各省（市）的实施办法，报由各大行政区行政委员会批准，并报政务院财政经济委员会备案。
    以上各项，应即遵照执行！
