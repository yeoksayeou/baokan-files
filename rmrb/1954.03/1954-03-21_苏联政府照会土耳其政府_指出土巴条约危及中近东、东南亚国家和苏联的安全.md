Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th—TASS Moscow, March 20th: On March 18th of this year, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs V.A. Zorin handed Mr. Tunaligil, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Republic of Turkey in Moscow, a note with the following content:

    The joint Turkish-Pakistani (hereinafter referred to as the Turkish-Pakistani) communiqué on the upcoming conclusion of the Turkish-Pakistani treaty was published on February 19th of this year. The treaty stipulates comprehensive cooperation between the two countries, including military cooperation. In view of this, the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic considers it necessary to issue the following statement to the Government of the Republic of Turkey:

    It can be seen from the aforementioned Turkish-Pakistani communiqué and the conversations of politicians of the two countries that the Turkish-Pakistani treaty being planned will not but endanger the security of their neighboring countries. Foreign newspapers, including Turkish newspapers, reported that this treaty stipulates active military cooperation between Turkey and Pakistan and lays the foundation for organizing a broader military bloc. Of particular note is that the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs stated in the Turkish Parliament on February 24th of this year that the Turkish-Pakistani treaty will attract other countries to participate in the military bloc. Therefore, it is not groundless to say that the aforementioned treaty is the core of establishing a Middle East military bloc. Since Turkey and Pakistan, as everyone knows, are not threatened by any aggression, this treaty cannot be considered defensive. On the contrary, it can be seen from the conversations of some politicians in Turkey and Pakistan that the preparation of this treaty is closely linked to the military plans of the Atlantic group, and thus involves the security of some countries, especially in the Near and Middle East and Southeast Asia. The Soviet government pointed out in its two notes to the Turkish government on November 24, 1951, and January 28, 1952, that the purpose of attempting to establish a bloc in the Near and Middle East is to turn the Near and Middle Eastern countries into a springboard for the armed forces of the Atlantic aggressive bloc. The purpose of the plan to establish the so-called "Middle East Command" by the United States, Britain, and Turkey, as well as other attempts, lies here: to leave foreign armed forces stationed in the Near and Middle Eastern countries under various pretexts, and to expand the network of foreign military bases in the Near and Middle East, so as to endanger the national interests and security of these countries. It is worth noting that currently, just as the Soviet government and some other countries are taking measures to ease international tensions and improve relations between countries, the Turkish government is conducting activities to establish military blocs in the Near and Middle East and Southeast Asia. Of course, this type of activity by the Turkish government cannot but intensify the situation in the Near and Middle East and Southeast Asia and directly endanger the security of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government believes it must draw the attention of the Republic of Turkey to the fact that such a policy cannot but damage Soviet-Turkish relations. By taking such actions, the Turkish government should be responsible for the consequences of this situation.

    Mr. Tunaligil promised to forward this note to the Turkish government. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe continues to hold meetings

### 苏联政府照会土耳其政府　指出土巴条约危及中近东、东南亚国家和苏联的安全

    苏联政府照会土耳其政府
　　指出土巴条约危及中近东、东南亚国家和苏联的安全
     【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：今年三月十八日，苏联外交部副部长瓦·亚·佐林交给土耳其共和国驻莫斯科临时代办图纳勒吉尔先生一件照会，内容如下：
    今年二月十九日公布了关于即将缔结土耳其—巴基斯坦（下简称土巴）条约的土巴联合公报，该条约规定两国实行包括军事合作在内的全面合作。有鉴于此，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府认为有必要向土耳其共和国政府发表下列声明：
    由上述土巴公报和两国政治家的谈话中可以看出，正在筹划中的土巴条约，不会不危及它们邻国的安全。包括土耳其报纸在内的外国报纸报道，这一条约规定土巴两国之间进行积极的军事合作，并为组织更广泛的军事集团打下基础。特别令人注意的是，土耳其外交部长曾于今年二月二十四日在土耳其议会中表示，土巴条约将吸引其他国家参加军事集团。因此，把上述条约说成是建立中东军事集团的核心，不是没有根据的。既然土耳其和巴基斯坦正如大家所知道的，并没有受到任何侵略的威胁，那么，这一条约就不能认为是防御性的。相反，从土耳其和巴基斯坦的一些政治家的谈话中可以看出，这一条约的准备是和大西洋集团的军事计划紧密地联系起来的，因而也就涉及到一些国家、特别是中近东以及东南亚国家的安全问题。苏联政府在一九五一年十一月二十四日和一九五二年一月二十八日致土耳其政府的两次照会中都曾指出，企图在中近东地区建立集团的目的是要把中近东国家变成大西洋侵略集团武装部队的跳板。美国、英国和土耳其建立所谓“中东司令部”的计划以及其他一些图谋的目的就在这里，这些图谋是：以种种的借口使外国武装部队留驻在中近东各国，并在中近东扩大外国军事基地网，以危害这些国家的民族利益和安全。值得注意的是，目前，正当苏联政府和其他一些国家采取一些措施以缓和国际紧张局势和改善各国之间的关系的时候，土耳其政府却在中近东和东南亚地区进行建立军事集团的活动。当然，土耳其政府的这一类活动不能不使中近东以及东南亚的局势紧张起来，并直接危及苏联的安全。苏联政府认为必须提请土耳其共和国政府注意：类似这样的政策不可能不损及苏土之间的关系。由于采取这样的行动，土耳其政府应对这一局势的后果负责。
    图纳勒吉尔先生答应将这一照会转交土耳其政府。联合国欧洲经济委员会继续举行会议
