Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 12th: According to TASS, at the meeting of the Second Congress on the 10th, the Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Bolesław Bierut, delivered the Central Committee Report of the Polish United Workers' Party.

Speaking of the international situation and Poland's foreign policy, Berut said that the Polish people fully support the Soviet Union's initiatives aimed at peacefully resolving international disputes, specifically the suggestions made by the Soviet Union in the draft "All-European Treaty on Ensuring European Collective Security." The main tasks of Poland's foreign policy are: to do its best to strengthen the unbreakable brotherly ideological ties and eternal friendship with the Soviet Union; to develop and strengthen friendly relations and cooperation with democratic countries; to further ease international tensions, to continue consultations, to ban the use of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, to reduce armaments, to seek agreements among the five major powers, to create a European collective security system, and to fight for national self-determination and sovereignty. We support all sincere efforts to resolve the German issue on a democratic basis, on the basis of establishing a unified and peaceful Germany.

Berut then spoke about the economic achievements of People's Poland and the implementation of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955). He said that between 1950 and 1953, the party and the government focused primarily on resolving issues related to the national socialist industrialization, as this was the main lever for developing the entire national economy on a socialist basis. The main task of national industrialization was basically successfully completed during the period from 1950 to 1953. Poland has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country with huge and growing economic potential. In 1953, industrial output was 3.6 times that of 1938, and the proportion of socialist industry in total industrial output reached more than 99 percent. The tasks set by the Six-Year Plan for 1953 have been overfulfilled. From 1950 to 1953, the industries producing the means of production developed particularly rapidly. Poland has established a shipbuilding industry, a tractor industry, a modern agricultural machinery industry, and an automobile industry; the production of ball bearings has been organized; and the manufacture of heavy-duty machine tools, mining equipment, and heavy electrical machines is progressing smoothly. A modern defense industry has been established and developed to the point where it can guarantee the country's defense needs. The production volume of daily necessities has also exceeded the planned level for 1953. The current task is to maximize the increase in agricultural production, increase the rate of increase in the production volume of daily necessities, and intensify the construction of housing and cultural institutions for the working people, thereby accelerating the improvement of the living standards of urban and rural working people. Therefore, in 1955, industry must increase the production volume of agricultural machinery and tools to more than twice that of 1953, and increase the production of fertilizers.

Berut said that the redistribution of forces and resources that we are currently implementing in our economic policy does not mean that we are relaxing our efforts in developing industries that produce the means of production. Rather, it means the further and continuous development of such industries, while simultaneously using the equipment they produce to help agriculture, to more rapidly develop the daily necessities industry, and to more rapidly transform other sectors of the national economy.

Berut then talked about agricultural issues.

He pointed out that in the first four years of the Six-Year Plan, agriculture was mainly developed on the basis of individual economy. This factor, as well as some other factors, made the development speed of agriculture not high, made the development of industry and agriculture unbalanced, and thus delayed the further development of the national economy.

Speaking of the development of agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state-owned farms, Berut said: By the end of 1953, more than 8,000 agricultural production cooperatives had been established nationwide, with approximately 200,000 farmers joining the cooperatives. The land they owned accounted for approximately 9 percent of the land owned by all farmers. Berut said that the party believes that the development of agricultural production cooperatives is of decisive significance, and it is the road to the fundamental transformation of Polish agriculture and the fundamental improvement of the living standards of the working people and the entire people.

Berut said that due to the increase in national income, the actual income of urban and rural working people has also increased significantly. The living standards of urban and rural working people will be greatly improved in the next two years. Therefore, conditions should be created so that the actual wages of workers and the income of laboring farmers will increase by an average of 15 to 20 percent in 1954 and 1955. Berut also talked about the achievements in culture, public health, and social insurance, as well as the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

Speaking of the Party's part, Berut said: Our party is growing, becoming stronger, and has become the leading and guiding force of our country. At the time of this Party Congress, the Party is more consolidated and united than ever before. The Party recognizes that continuously strengthening the unity of the Party ranks and improving the Party's composition are the main conditions for enhancing the Party's strength and combat effectiveness. The Party now has 1,297,000 members and candidate members. Workers account for 48.3 percent of the total number of Party members. Berut also talked about Party building issues and put forward the current specific tasks of the Polish United Workers' Party.

Berut finally shouted: Forward to new victories under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin! A storm of cheers resounded in the venue.

    在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上
    贝鲁特作波兰统一工人党中央委员会报告
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社华沙十二日讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会主席波·贝鲁特，在第二次代表大会十日会议上作了波兰统一工人党中央委员会报告。
    贝鲁特在谈到国际局势和波兰的外交政策时说，波兰人民完全支持苏联提出的旨在和平解决国际争端的倡议，具体说来就是苏联在“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案中提出的建议。波兰外交政策的主要任务是：尽力加强和苏联的牢不可破的兄弟般的思想联系和永恒的友谊；发展并加强和民主阵营各国的友好关系和合作；为进一步缓和国际紧张局势、为继续协商、为禁止使用原子武器和所有其他大规模毁灭的武器、为裁减军备、为五大国协议、为欧洲集体安全体系、为民族自决权和主权而斗争。我们支持为了在民主的基础上、在建立统一与和平的德国的基础上解决德国问题而作的一切真诚的努力。
    贝鲁特接着谈到了人民波兰的经济成就和六年计划（一九五○——一九五五年）的执行情况。他说，在一九五零年到一九五三年间，党和政府的注意力主要集中在与解决国家社会主义工业化有关的问题上，因为这是在社会主义基础上发展整个国民经济的主要杠杆。国家工业化的主要任务已基本上在一九五零年到一九五三年这段时期中顺利完成。波兰已从一个落后的农业国，变为一个具有巨大的、日益增长的经济潜力的社会主义工业国。一九五三年的工业产量为一九三八年的三点六倍，社会主义工业在工业总产量中所占的比重达百分之九十九以上。六年计划为一九五三年规定的任务已超额完成了。从一九五零年到一九五三年，生产生产资料的工业发展得特别迅速。波兰已建立了造船工业、拖拉机工业、现代农业机器工业和汽车工业；滚珠轴承的生产已经组织起来；重型工作母机、采矿设备、重型电气机器的制造已在顺利进行。现代化的国防工业已经建立，而且发展到了可以保证国家防御需要的程度。日用品的生产量也已经超过了一九五三年计划水平。现在的任务是要最大限度地促进农业生产的增加，提高日用品生产量的增加速度，加紧为劳动人民建筑住宅和文化机构，从而加速城乡劳动人民生活水平的提高。因此，工业在一九五五年必须把农业机器和工具的生产量提高到一九五三年的两倍以上，并增加肥料的产量。
    贝鲁特说，我们现在在经济政策中所实行的力量和资源的重新分配，一点也不意味着我们放松了在发展生产生产资料的工业方面的努力，而是意味着这种工业的进一步的、不断的发展，并同时利用它所生产的设备来帮助农业，来更迅速地发展日用品工业，来更迅速地改造国民经济的其他部门。
    贝鲁特接着谈到关于农业的问题。
    他指出，在六年计划的头四年中，农业主要是在个体经济的基础上发展的。这个因素以及其他一些因素使农业的发展速度不高，使工业和农业的发展不均衡，因而延缓了国民经济的进一步发展。
    在谈到农业生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的发展时，贝鲁特说：到一九五三年年底，全国共成立了八千多个农业生产合作社，加入合作社的农民约二十万人。它们所拥有的土地已占全体农户土地的百分之九左右。贝鲁特说，党认为农业生产合作事业的发展具有决定性的意义，它是走向波兰农业的根本改造、走向劳动人民和全体人民生活水平的根本提高的道路。
    贝鲁特说，由于国民收入的增加，城乡劳动人民的实际收入也有了相当大的增加。今后两年内还要大大提高城乡劳动人民的生活水平。因此，应该创造条件，使得工人的实际工资和劳动农民的收入在一九五四年和一九五五年平均增加百分之十五到百分之二十。贝鲁特还谈到在文化、公共卫生和社会保险方面的成就，以及工农联盟的进一步巩固。
    贝鲁特在谈到党的部分时说：我们的党正在成长、壮大，并已成为我们国家的领导和指导力量。在召开这次党代表大会的时候，党比任何时候都更加巩固、更加团结。党认识到不断加强党的队伍的团结和改进党的成分，是增强党的力量和战斗力的主要条件。党现在有一百二十九万七千名党员和候补党员。在党员总人数中工人占百分之四十八点三。贝鲁特还谈到了党的建设问题，并提出了波兰统一工人党当前的具体任务。
    贝鲁特最后高呼：在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下向新的胜利前进！会场上响起了暴风雨般的欢呼声。
