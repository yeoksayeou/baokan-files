　　To Guarantee the Needs of the National Textile Industry and Civilian Wadding
　　Cotton Producing Areas Across the Country Appropriately Expand Cotton Fields
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to guarantee the needs of the national textile industry and civilian wadding, the main cotton producing areas of our country—North China, East China, and the area north of the Yangtze River in Central South China, as well as parts of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces—have appropriately formulated plans this year to increase cotton production by expanding planting areas and increasing yields per unit area. The North China region plans to expand the planting area by 14.4 percent compared to last year, with a total output increase of 29 percent. The cotton planting area in Hebei and Shanxi provinces will reach 20 million mu. Henan and Hubei provinces have also expanded their cotton fields by more than 1.2 million mu this year. The cotton planting area in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces is both above 10 million mu, with the newly reclaimed land in the coastal reclamation area of Jiangsu Province mostly prepared for cotton planting. Sichuan Province requires a universal increase in yield and an expansion of planting area in suitable cotton growing areas, with a total output increase of 11.17 percent compared to last year. Farmers in Shaanxi Province originally had a tendency to reduce cotton fields, but since the promotion of the general line, and the strengthening of cotton purchasing work and resolution of grain supply issues, cotton farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton has gradually increased, and the area of dry land cotton fields has also been appropriately expanded. The total cotton output of the entire Northwest region this year is required to reach 2.15 million dan, an increase of more than 7 percent compared to last year.
　　Since late January, various cotton producing areas have successively begun to study and deploy cotton planting work, and have actively led farmers in making preparations. This year, the vast majority of cotton fields in Hebei Province will be planted with the high-quality "Si" variety of cotton. Farmers have already conducted seed selection for the retained cotton seeds, improving the purity of the cotton seeds. Agricultural agencies in Hebei and Shanxi provinces have also transferred more than 50 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds and more than 1 billion jin of fine fertilizer to cotton producing areas. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation has already transported more than 2 million jin of pesticides, 50,000 pieces of agricultural machinery, and some chemical fertilizers to cotton producing areas to meet farmers' production needs. Last year, the Yancheng, Nantong, and Yangzhou special districts of Jiangsu Province had a bumper cotton harvest, and farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton is very high. They have all retained a certain amount of seeds themselves. The province has also secured more than 4 million jin of cotton seeds, preparing for the need to expand cotton fields and support neighboring provinces. In order to improve cotton quality, Anhui Province has transferred more than 1.6 million jin of the high-quality "Dai" variety of cotton from Jiangsu, and is promoting it in the Anqing, Chuxian, and Wuhu special districts. Winter rainfall and snowfall have been scarce in North China, Henan Province, Sichuan Province, and other places. Attention has been paid to mobilizing farmers to harrow the land to preserve soil moisture and store water for drought prevention. After widespread snowfall at the end of February, most areas have completed spring harrowing, ensuring timely sowing. Soil moisture conditions in Shandong Province and most areas along the Yangtze River are better than in previous years, bringing favorable conditions for cotton sowing. Shaanxi Province and other areas with water conservancy conditions are actively carrying out spring irrigation of cotton fields, striving for timely sowing.

    为保证国家纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要
　　全国产棉区适当扩大棉田
    【本报讯】我国出产棉花的主要地区——华北区、华东区和中南区的长江以北地区、四川和陕西两省部分地区，为了保证国家纺织工业和民用絮棉的需要，今年都适当地制订了扩大种植面积和提高单位面积产量的棉花增产计划。华北区计划比去年扩大种植面积百分之十四点四，总产量增加百分之二十九，河北、山西两省的植棉面积达两千万亩。河南、湖北两省今年也扩大了一百二十多万亩棉田，山东、江苏两省的植棉面积都在一千万亩以上，江苏省沿海垦区新垦地多准备植棉。四川省要求普遍提高产量，并在宜棉区扩大种植面积，总产量比去年要增加百分之十一点一七。陕西省农民本有缩小棉田趋势，自从宣传总路线，及加强收购棉花的工作并解决粮食供应问题以后，棉农植棉情绪逐渐高涨，旱地棉田面积也适当扩大。西北全区的棉花总产量今年要求达到二百一十五万担，比去年增加百分之七以上。
    各产棉区从一月下旬以来，陆续开始研究、布置植棉工作，并积极领导农民进行准备。河北省今年绝大部分棉田将播种斯字棉良种，农民对所留棉种已进行粒选，提高了棉籽的纯度。河北、山西两省农业机关并向产棉区调剂了优良棉种五千多万斤，细肥十亿余斤。山东省合作总社已运往产棉区二百多万斤农药和五万多件农业机械以及部分化学肥料，供应农民生产需要。江苏省盐城、南通、扬州等专区去年棉花丰收，农民植棉情绪很高，他们都自留了一定数量的种籽。省里还掌握了四百多万斤棉种，准备扩大棉田需要和支援邻省。安徽省为了提高棉花质量，已由江苏调剂了岱字棉良种一百六十多万斤，在安庆、滁县、芜湖三个专区推广。华北区和河南省、四川省等地冬季雨雪稀少，已注意发动农民耙地保墒、蓄水防旱，二月底普遍降雪后，大部地区都已做好春耙，保证能及时播种。山东省和长江沿岸大部地区土壤墒情都比往年好，给棉花播种带来了有利条件。陕西省及其他有水利条件的地区，正积极进行棉田春灌，争取适时播种。
