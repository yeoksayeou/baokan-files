Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 27th. Our special correspondent reports: It has been seven months since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on the 27th. Over these seven months, the Korean and Chinese side has consistently and strictly abided by and effectively implemented the provisions of the Armistice Agreement concerning the stability of the military armistice. However, the U.S. side, on the one hand, is carrying out its plan to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and on the other hand, continues to violate these important provisions, obstructs and interferes in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in many ways, continuously creates air and ground violations of the Armistice Agreement, and illegally transports a large number of reinforcing combat materials from outside Korea to realize its conspiracy to arm the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

The rotations and replacements on the Korean and Chinese side over the past seven months have been carried out under the supervision and inspection of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's neutral inspection teams. The results of inspections and spot checks conducted by the various neutral inspection teams have proved that the rotations and replacements on the Korean and Chinese side are fully consistent with the figures reported to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. It can be clearly seen from the reports submitted by the Korean and Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that, whether in terms of rotation or replacement, the number of people and material leaving Korea exceeds the number entering. As of the end of January this year, the cumulative number of military personnel rotated into North Korea by the Korean and Chinese side was only 9,836, less than half the number leaving. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that the monthly quota for the rotation of military personnel is 35,000.

The U.S. side falsely accused the Korean and Chinese side last October of transporting combat aircraft into Korea in crates. However, the investigation results of the mobile neutral inspection team sent to Uiju Airport proved that the U.S. side's accusation was completely unfounded and a complete fabrication.

The situation in the ports of South Korea is quite the opposite. Since the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side has been violating the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the cessation of the entry of reinforcing combat materials, transporting combat materials into South Korea after disassembling them in the name of parts or disassembled components, and then assembling them. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has long pointed out that on August 4th, the U.S. side disassembled 106 4.2-inch mortars and packed them into 318 boxes, which were transported into South Korea from the port of Busan. According to the reports of the various neutral inspection teams in South Korea, from the armistice to the end of January, the U.S. side transported in howitzer barrels and recoil mechanisms, which could be assembled into at least 149 105mm and 155mm howitzers; the U.S. side transported in cannon barrels and recoil mechanisms, which could be assembled into at least 57 155mm cannons. The U.S. side also transported in thousands of rifle barrels and light and heavy machine gun receivers, as well as a large number of parts and disassembled components of various weapons, and more than 460,000 pounds of aircraft parts. Recently, the U.S. side has refused to continue discussing the parts issue in order to freely transport combat materials into South Korea after disassembling them.

Another way for the U.S. side to transport reinforcing combat materials from outside Korea is not to report to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission or to underreport the combat materials transported in. Only after the neutral inspection teams discovered certain "replaced" combat materials did the U.S. side submit supplementary reports. For example, the Busan neutral inspection team inspected the U.S. side's import of 40,000 pounds of bombs on January 19th. However, the U.S. side only submitted a supplementary report nine days later, and insisted that it had "destroyed" the same amount of bombs on the same day that the bombs were transported in.

The U.S. side also violated the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the "replacement of combat aircraft on a one-for-one basis with the same performance and type." The number of about ten types of combat aircraft transported into Korea exceeded the number transported out. According to the U.S. report to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as of the end of November, 46 more F-86F combat aircraft were transported into Korea than were transported out, and 10 more F-94B combat aircraft were transported into Korea. As for T-33 and TB-17 aircraft, the U.S. side even openly refused to submit reports.

In the past seven months, U.S. military aircraft have continuously violated the Armistice Agreement by intruding into our area. According to incomplete statistics, from the armistice to the end of January, U.S. military aircraft intruded into our area and over the sea a total of 200 batches, 442 sorties. U.S. military aircraft openly flew in formation over the headquarters area of the Military Armistice Commission, intruded into Kaesong, where the Korean and Chinese armistice delegation was located, and even intruded into our rear areas, such as the mouth of the Chongchon River, about 50 kilometers north of Pyongyang. In the period from January 19th to 22nd, before and after the U.S. side hijacked more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from Tongjang-ri, U.S. military aircraft intruded into our area in 28 batches, 72 sorties.

This series of violations of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side proves that the U.S. side deliberately maintains the instability of the Korean armistice in order to create and maintain a tense situation.

### 我方七个月来严格遵守并执行停战协定  美方不断违反停战协定借以制造紧张局势

    我方七个月来严格遵守并执行停战协定
    美方不断违反停战协定借以制造紧张局势
     【新华社开城二十七日电】本社特派记者报道：朝鲜停战协定签字到二十七日已有七个月。这七个月来，朝中方面一贯严格遵守并切实执行停战协定中有关保证军事停战稳定的条款。但是美方一方面进行它的强迫扣留朝中战俘的计划，另一方面不断地违反这些重要的条款，对中立国监察委员会的工作多方加以阻挠和干涉，不断制造空中和地面违反停战协定的事件，并且非法地从朝鲜境外运进大批增援性作战物资，以实现其武装李承晚傀儡军队的阴谋。
    朝中方面七个月来的轮换和替换，是在中立国监察委员会中立国视察小组的视察与监督之下进行的。各中立国视察小组进行监察与抽查性质的视察结果证明，朝中方面的轮换与替换与它向中立国监察委员会报告的数字完全相符。从朝中方面提交中立国监察委员会的报告中可以清楚地看出，无论是在轮换或替换方面，运出朝鲜的都超过运入的。截至今年一月底，朝中方面军事人员轮换入境的累计数字仅九千八百三十六人，不及出境人数的一半。停战协定规定：军事人员每月的轮换限额为三万五千人。
    美方曾在去年十月诬蔑朝中方面把作战飞机装箱运入朝鲜。但派赴义州机场的机动中立国视察小组的调查结果证明，美方的指控毫无事实根据，完全是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    在南朝鲜的各口岸的情况却截然相反。美方在停战协定签字以后，一直违反停战协定关于停止进入增援性作战物资的规定，以零件或拆散件为名，把作战物资拆散后运入南朝鲜再加以装配。中立国监察委员会早已指出：美方在八月四日把一百零六门四点二英寸的迫击炮拆散分装三百一十八箱，从釜山口岸运入南朝鲜。根据在南朝鲜的各中立国视察小组的报告材料，自停战以后到一月底止，美方运入的榴弹炮炮筒和后座机械，至少可以装配成一百四十九门一零五公厘和一五五公厘的榴弹炮；美方运入的大炮炮筒和后座机械，至少可以装配成五十七门一五五公厘的大炮。美方还运进了成千的步枪枪筒和轻重机枪的枪身，和大量的各种武器的零件和拆散件，以及四十六万磅以上的飞机零件。最近，美方又拒绝继续讨论零件问题，以便放手地把作战物资拆散后运入南朝鲜。
    美方从朝鲜境外运进增援性作战物资的另一个办法，是不向中立国监察委员会报告或者少报运入的作战物资。只是在中立国视察小组发现了某些
  “替换”的作战物资以后，美方才提出补充报告。例如，釜山中立国视察小组在一月十九日视察到美方运入了四万磅炸弹。但是美方在九天以后才提出补充报告，并且硬说在运进炸弹的同一天“毁坏”了同样数量的炸弹。
    美方并违反停战协定关于作战飞机“在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换”的规定，约有十种类型的作战飞机运入朝鲜的超过了运出的。根据美方向中立国监察委员会的报告，截至十一月底止，F—86F型作战飞机运入朝鲜的比运出的多四十六架，F—94B型作战飞机运入朝鲜的多了十架。至于对T—33和TB—17等类型的作战飞机，美方甚至公然拒绝提出报告。
      美方军用飞机在过去七个月中，曾连续地违反停战协定侵入我方地区。根据不完全的统计，自停战后到一月底止，美方军用飞机侵入我方地区及沿海上空，共达两百批、四百四十二架次之多。美方军用飞机公然编队飞越军事停战委员会总部区，侵入朝中停战代表团所在地开城，甚至侵入平壤以北约五十公里的清川江口等我方后方地区。在一月十九日到二十二日美方劫夺东场里二万多名朝中战俘前后，美方军用飞机侵入我方地区达二十八批、七十二架次。
      美方这一系列违反停战协定的事件证明：美方故意保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，借以制造和保持紧张局势。
