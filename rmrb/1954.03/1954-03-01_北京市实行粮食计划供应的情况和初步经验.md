Since liberation, with the restoration and development of the national economic construction and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the urban and rural people, the demand for grain has been increasing day by day. In particular, the consumption of fine grains has grown even faster. In 1950, the sales volume of fine grains in Beijing only accounted for about 30 percent of the total grain sales, while by October 1953, the sales volume of fine grains accounted for 83 percent of the total grain sales, of which flour alone accounted for 60 percent of the total grain sales. Under these circumstances, coupled with the opportunity taken by unscrupulous merchants to engage in grain speculation, it has further increased the difficulty for the state in grain management and allocation. If this situation is not resolved in time, it will inevitably create a serious chaotic situation in the grain market, which will facilitate the hoarding and speculation activities of a few unscrupulous merchants, affect the stability of the overall price level and the stability of people's lives, and hinder the smooth progress of the national construction. Of course, the fundamental solution to the grain problem is to realize the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy and the collectivization of agricultural production, but this can only be gradually resolved over a considerable period of time with the gradual realization of the country's socialist industrialization. Under the current conditions, in order to do a good job in grain supply and curb the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, so as to ensure the stability of people's lives and the smooth progress of national construction, it is necessary to implement planned supply. In November 1953, Beijing, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and after unanimous adoption by the Municipal People's Congress, successively implemented planned supply of flour, rice, and coarse grains. Since its implementation, the market has been stable and the people's minds have been at ease. The preliminary experiences of Beijing's planned grain supply are:

    1.  The implementation of planned grain supply is greatly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is a positive measure to ensure the people's livelihood and the smooth progress of the national construction. Therefore, it is necessary to combine it with the general line of the transition period and carry out universal and in-depth publicity and explanation work to the entire people. Under the unified leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Beijing held cadre meetings in all municipal organs, schools, industrial and mining enterprises to convey the policy and methods of implementing planned grain supply and universally studied them. At the same time, Party committees and government organs at all levels organized large-scale propaganda teams to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda to the city's people, calling on the city's people to unite and oppose the speculative activities of illegal grain merchants, pay attention to saving grain, and actively implement the government's grain policy. In a very short period of time, the urban area basically achieved household awareness. Workers, cadres, students, and people from all walks of life expressed enthusiastic support, believing that "this is a step towards socialism," "grain merchants should have been banned long ago," and "doing so stabilizes grain prices and ensures livelihood."

    2.  The implementation of planned grain supply is a new and complex task. We have no experience, so before proposing specific measures for planned grain supply, we repeatedly conducted investigation and research. First, we investigated the types and quantities of grain consumed by people of all social strata, the distribution of state-owned retail companies, cooperatives, and private grain merchants, and their supply capacity. In the case of insufficient flour supply, according to the needs of the masses and the strength of the national supply, and following the principles of subordinating to the interests of national socialist industrialization, taking care of the working people, and giving as much care as possible to industrial workers, we adopted the method of supplying flour in different grades and quantities. The supply of flour required by the food industry will temporarily continue to be supplied according to its past actual sales volume. Since its implementation, the masses have reflected that "the grading method is very practical, and taking care of the working people is very reasonable." This shows that the standards for graded and quantitative supply of flour are in line with the living conditions of people of all social strata, and the masses generally feel reasonable and satisfied.

    For rice and coarse grains, the supply quantity per person has not been stipulated for the time being, mainly to prohibit private merchants from freely buying and selling. The unified sales method adopted by Beijing is: several grain retail outlets and consignment stores are set up according to the jurisdiction of the public security police station. Residents can purchase grain at the grain retail outlets or consignment stores in the jurisdiction of the police station where they live according to their monthly consumption volume with their grain purchase certificates. At the same time, according to the distribution of public and private consignment stores, supply areas are divided and fixed-point supply is implemented. The principle of fixed-point is to take care of the convenience of the masses to purchase grain, but also to take care of the distribution of public and private consignment stores and their specific conditions. This not only achieves the purpose of planned grain supply, strengthens the state's planning in grain sales, transportation, storage, etc., effectively prevents grain speculation and hoarding, but also facilitates the masses' supervision of grain merchants and facilitates the masses' purchase of grain.

    In the suburbs, the supply to grain-deficient households among farmers is combined with unified purchase, relying on farmers' democratic evaluation of the supply quantity, and according to the country's supply capacity, appropriate supply of flour is provided to farmers who have no wheat or sell most of their wheat to the country.

    3.  In the implementation of planned flour supply, the management of the food industry is a major problem. There are more than 7,000 food businesses in Beijing, with a total of more than 16,000 employees. There are many travelers and Beijing employees and citizens who buy food and some snacks. If the restrictions are too strict, it will affect the lives of the masses and the business of the food industry, but if no restrictions are imposed, it will become a major loophole in the planned grain supply. In order to take care of the people's living needs, we have adopted a relatively full supply method for the food and pastry industries, that is, each household submits a monthly plan according to its past actual consumption, which is reviewed and approved by the industrial and commercial administration authorities according to the specific circumstances, and the supply is made according to the plan. Although the People's Government provides care for the food industry, some food stores still do not abide by the government's management methods. They underreport flour inventory, overreport consumption, sell less or refuse to sell food, or reduce portions and increase prices to resist the government's planned supply policy. For example, 51 food stalls in Xuanwu District underreported 564 bags of stored flour; six food stalls outside Fuchengmen refused to sell flour food for two days; and some reduced portions. In response, we took the following measures: (1) In areas where workers gather, cooperatives promptly increased and expanded public canteens to meet the needs of the working people. (2) Noodles are uniformly processed and exclusively sold by cooperatives and retail companies, and private merchants are not allowed to operate themselves to prevent arbitrage. (3) Mobilize the food industry to increase the sale of rice and coarse grain foods. Since its implementation, sales have been very good. (4) The government gives criticism, education or appropriate punishment to illegal food businesses. After the above measures were taken, the food industry's business gradually returned to normal.

    4.  The implementation of planned grain supply must be properly arranged for private grain merchants. In the implementation of planned supply, although many grain merchants and peddlers expressed their support for the national policy, some grain merchants adopted various methods to resist. For example, when Beijing first implemented the planned flour supply, the sales volume of corn flour increased, but some private grain processing industries refused to process it for the country. In the past, 38 grain stores entrusted to process could grind 90,000 jin of flour per day, but on October 31 last year, they only produced more than 7,000 jin. When the government took emergency measures to convert some state-owned machine flour mills to grind corn flour, they then requested the government to take care of them. When registering stored flour, some grain merchants were extremely dishonest and even concealed and falsely reported. In response, on the one hand, we strengthened the administrative management of grain merchants and peddlers, and on the other hand, through the exposure and handling of speculative and illegal facts of grain merchants and peddlers, we educated grain merchants to recognize that only by loving the country, abiding by the law, and taking the path of state capitalism can they have a bright future. For general private grain merchants, we approve as much as possible those who apply to process and sell on behalf of the state according to their specific conditions in order to maintain their business; the government also tries to help those who apply for career change or closure.

    5.  The implementation of planned grain supply must rely closely on the leadership of the Party, rely on workers and peasants, and unite people from all walks of life to fight for the realization of the country's grain policy. In the graded supply of flour, we appropriately took care of the workers according to the necessary and possible conditions, and obtained the enthusiastic support of the broad masses for the unified sales of grain; and in the suburbs, we first adopted the method of consulting with liberated farmers, and then reported and discussed from the bottom up, so that the planned supply work could be carried out smoothly, and the masses were satisfied.

The planned grain supply work has been successfully implemented in Beijing, but this is a new and complex task, and this work is only just beginning, so there are still many shortcomings and problems that need to be continuously summarized and improved in future practical work.

    北京市实行粮食计划供应的情况和初步经验
    北京市人民政府财政经济委员会
    解放以来，随着国家经济建设事业的恢复和发展，城乡人民生活的日渐提高，粮食需要量正日益增加。特别是细粮的消费量增长得更快。一九五○年北京市细粮的销售量只占粮食总销量的百分之三十左右，而至一九五三年十月份细粮销量则占到粮食总销量的百分之八十三，其中面粉一项就占到粮食总销量的百分之六十。在这种情况下，再加上奸商乘机从事粮食的投机活动，就更增加了国家对粮食管理和调度上的困难。这种情况若不及时加以解决，势必会造成粮食市场的严重混乱局面，而便利少数奸商的囤积居奇投机倒把的活动，影响整个物价的稳定和人民生活的安定，妨碍国家建设事业的顺利进行。当然，解决粮食问题的根本办法是实现对小农经济的社会主义改造和农业生产的集体化，但这是要在相当长的时期后，随着国家社会主义工业化的逐步实现才能逐步解决的。在目前条件下，要做好粮食供应工作，制止奸商的投机活动，以保障人民生活的安定和国家建设事业的顺利进行，必须进行计划供应。北京市于一九五三年十一月份起，根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，并经市各界人民代表会议一致通过决议，对面粉、大米、粗粮相继实行了计划供应。实行以来，市场平稳，人心安定。北京市粮食计划供应的初步经验是：
    一、实行粮食计划供应和国计民生的关系甚大，是保障人民生活及国家建设事业顺利进行的积极措施，因此，必须结合过渡时期的总路线，向全体人民进行普遍深入的宣传解释工作。北京市在中共北京市委会的统一领导下，在全市机关、学校、工矿企业内分别召开干部大会进行了传达，并普遍学习了实行粮食计划供应的政策和办法。同时，各级党委和政府机关都组织了大规模的宣传队伍，向全市人民进行了广泛深入的宣传，号召全市人民团结一致，反对不法粮商的投机活动，注意节约粮食，积极贯彻政府的粮食政策。在很短的时间内，城区基本上做到了家喻户晓。工人、干部、学生及各界人民都表示热烈拥护，认为“这是向社会主义迈进了一步”，“粮商早该取缔”，“这样做粮价稳定，生活有保障”。
      二、实行粮食计划供应是一件新的复杂的工作，我们没有经验，所以在提出粮食计划供应具体办法之前，我们反复地进行了调查研究工作。首先调查了各阶层人民食用粮食的品种和数量，国营零售公司、合作社及私营粮商的机构分布及供应能力。在面粉供应不足的情况下，根据群众的需要和国家供应的力量，在服从国家社会主义工业化的利益、对劳动人民加以照顾、对产业工人尽量多予照顾的原则下，我们对面粉采取了分等定量供应的办法。对面食业所需面粉的供应，暂时仍按其过去实际销售量供应。执行以来，群众反映说：“分等办法很实际，照顾劳动人民很合理。”说明面粉分等定量供应的标准，是符合各阶层人民生活状况的，群众普遍感到合理满意。
    对大米、粗粮暂时未规定对每人的供应数量，主要是禁止私商自由买卖。北京市采取的统销办法是：按公安派出所管辖区设置若干粮食零售机构和代销店，居民凭购粮证到其居住的派出所管辖区的粮食零售机构或代销店，按每月的食用量购买粮食。同时根据公私营代销店的分布情况划分供应区，实行定点供应。定点的原则是既照顾群众购粮方便，也要照顾公私代销店的分布情况及具体条件。这样既达到了粮食计划供应的目的，使国家在粮食销售、调运、保管等方面均加强了计划性，有效地防止了粮食投机囤积，又便于群众对粮商的监督，也便利了群众购粮。
    在郊区对农民中缺粮户的供应，是结合统购，依靠农民民主评议供应数量，并根据国家的供应力量，对无小麦户及把小麦绝大部分都卖给国家的农民，适当供应面粉。
    三、在实行面粉计划供应时，对面食业的管理是个很大的问题。北京市面食业共有七千多户，从业人员共有一万六千多人，来往旅客及北京市职工、市民买饭吃及买一部分零食的人很多，如限制太严则会影响群众生活及面食业的营业，但如不加限制，则将成为粮食计划供应中一个很大的漏洞。为照顾人民生活需要，我们对面食业、糕点业采取了比较充分供应的办法，即由各户按以往实际用量逐月造具计划，经工商行政管理机关根据具体情况审查批准，按计划供应。人民政府虽然对面食业给以照顾，但仍有一部分面食店不遵守政府管理办法。他们少报面粉库存量，多报耗用量，少售或拒售食品，或减少分量，提高价格，来抵抗人民政府计划供应的政策。如宣武区五十一个面食铺，少报存面五百六十四袋；阜城门外六户饭摊两天拒售面食；有的则减少分量。对此我们采取了如下的措施：（一）在工人聚集地区，由合作社及时增设和扩大了公共食堂，供应劳动人民的需要。（二）挂面统一由合作社、零售公司加工包销，不准私商自营，以防套购。（三）动员面食业增售大米、粗粮食品。执行以来，销路很好。（四）对违法的面食业由政府分别给予批评教育或适当处罚。经过采取上述措施后，面食业的营业日趋正常。
    四、实行粮食计划供应必须做好安排私营粮商的工作。在实行计划供应时，不少粮商、粮贩虽表示拥护国家政策，但有一部分粮商则采取各种方式抵抗。如北京市在实行面粉计划供应之初，玉米面销量增加，但有一部分私营粮食加工业则拒绝为国家加工。过去有三十八家被委托加工的粮店每日本可磨面九万斤，但在去年十月三十一日却只出面七千多斤。当政府采取了紧急措施，将国营一部分机器面粉厂改装磨制玉米面后，则又纷纷请求政府加以照顾。在登记存面时，有一部分粮商极不老实，竟然隐瞒谎报。对此我们一方面加强对粮商、粮贩的行政管理，另一方面又通过对粮商、粮贩的投机违法事实的揭发和处理，教育粮商，使其认清只有爱国守法，走国家资本主义的道路，才有光明的前途。对于一般私营粮商，凡是申请要求为国家加工代销者，我们均根据其具体条件，尽可能批准，以维持其营业；凡申请转业、歇业者政府也尽量设法予以帮助。
    五、实行粮食计划供应，必须紧紧依靠党的领导，依靠工人、农民，团结各阶层人民，为实现国家的粮食政策而斗争。我们在面粉分等供应中，根据必要与可能的条件，适当地照顾了工人，取得了广大群众对粮食统销的热烈拥护；又在郊区采取了首先依靠翻身农民商量的办法，然后自下而上地自报公议，使计划供应工作得以顺利开展，群众均感满意。
    粮食计划供应工作在北京市已经胜利地实施了，但这是一件新的复杂的任务，而且这一工作还仅是开始，因而还存在着许多缺点和问题，需要在今后实际工作中不断总结经验，加以改进。
