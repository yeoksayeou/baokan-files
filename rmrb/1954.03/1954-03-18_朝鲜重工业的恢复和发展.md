    The Restoration and Development of North Korea's Heavy Industry
    Kim Doo-sam, Minister of Heavy Industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    After achieving a historic victory in the struggle against the armed aggression of the American and British imperialists and in defense of freedom and independence, the Korean people have begun the first year of a three-year plan (1954-1956) to restore the war-torn people's economy to pre-war levels and create the necessary conditions for its further development, for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. That is to say, our country has embarked on the road of laying the foundation for future industrialization.
    In completing the nationwide task of restoring and building the people's economy destroyed by the war, we have a favorable condition, which is the enormous fraternal assistance provided by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries.
    Looking at these assistances only from the industrial aspect, many factories, power plants, and coal mines will be restored in our country in the future, and dozens of factories that our country never had before will be newly built.
    Based on this assistance, the colonial and deformed state of our country's industry in the past will be eliminated, and its independence will be guaranteed. The destroyed factories and enterprises will not be restored as they were, but many heavy industrial factories and enterprises—the backbone of our people's economic development—will be repaired, rebuilt, and expanded on the basis of modern, state-of-the-art technology.
    The main sectors of our people's economy will be equipped with modern production technology in the next three or four years and will develop to a higher stage, laying a solid material foundation for our country's future industrialization, thereby accelerating the speed of our country's industrial development. Thanks to the assistance of the fraternal countries, our heavy industry will be rapidly restored and constructed.
    First of all, in the metal industry sector, the Soviet government has decided to restore and construct black and non-ferrous metallurgical factories, including the Chongjin Steel Plant, the Kim Chaek Steel Plant, and the Nampo Smelting Plant, free of charge. The Soviet government is helping us with all work from surveying and design to technical guidance and factory commissioning. Now, construction machinery, electrical equipment, and other materials needed for restoration and construction are continuously being transported to our country.
    Workers, technicians, and staff in the metal industry sector are devoting all their efforts to repairing the destroyed production equipment and preparing for the large-scale reconstruction and expansion work—investigation and sorting work.
    Now, the Chongjin Steel Plant has ensured a series of production operations such as steelmaking, rolling, and forming; the steelmaking furnace and coking furnace of the Kim Chaek Steel Plant have been put into production; and the Nampo Smelting Plant will start producing copper bars this year. In addition, the factory led by Comrade Han Guk-mo is concentrating on the repair of open-hearth furnaces on the one hand, and has started the production of steel plates on the other. The factory led by Comrade Li Kyu-bong is producing steel ingots. The factory led by Comrade Mun Pil-mo will produce electrical lead in 1954.
    Thanks to the great assistance of the great Soviet Union, our black and non-ferrous metallurgical industry will soon eliminate the colonial deformity and technological backwardness under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and will be replaced by modern equipment and advanced technology. In this way, we will be able to produce steel products that fully meet domestic requirements, such as steel pipes, steel rails, wheels, and other rolled steel, and further develop economic ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries.
    Under the correct leadership of the Labor Party and the Republic's government, the heavy industry sector had already prepared for the restoration and development of the people's economy after the war during the war, as was the case with the machine industry. Therefore, some of the machinery and equipment aided by the people of the fraternal countries, headed by the Soviet Union, have already been put into production after the war. This has laid the foundation for the rapid development of the machine industry in the short term in the future.
    The development of the machine industry is of great significance in strengthening national defense capabilities and is a basic condition for our country's future industrialization. For this reason, the Party and the government attach special importance to the development of the machine industry and have adopted measures to import a large number of machine tools from abroad on the one hand, and to concentrate on the use of domestic machine tools and factory equipment on the other.
    Thanks to the assistance of the fraternal countries, headed by the Soviet Union, in the machine industry after the war, we will soon have factories of our own that produce machine tools, engines, electrical machinery, auto parts, tools, water pumps, cast pipes, motors, transformers, wires, cables, etc. For example, we will have tractor repair plants, auto parts plants, engine plants, tool plants, machine tool manufacturing plants, electrical appliance manufacturing plants, etc. This will create favorable conditions for us to expand new factories and increase equipment with our own hands.
    The rapid development of our country's metal and machine industries will become a solid foundation for the development of all other industries and agriculture.
    In order to adapt to the rapid restoration and development of the metal industry, we must pay full attention to the rapid development of the mining industry and the development of our country's rich underground resources after the war. Now, our country has opened up a broad road in the development of the mining industry.
    Starting this year, dozens of geological prospecting teams, armed with Soviet geological prospecting science and technology and equipped with the latest Soviet drilling machines, have been actively conducting key prospecting. This will bring an epoch-making development to the development of our country's underground resources.
    At the same time, after the armistice, Seongheung, Geomdeok, Seongcheon, Goksan and other mines have been intensively repaired, and their equipment and technology have also been improved in a planned manner. In particular, the ore dressing plants of the above four mines have been built, eliminating technical backwardness and economic irrationality, significantly improving the ore dressing rate and actual productivity, and saving manpower.
    The mines that were flooded during the war will be restored and start production in the next year or two. Our country's mine products will not only guarantee the needs of domestic restoration and construction, but can also be exported.
    We can also estimate the rapid development of the coal industry, which is closely related to industrial development and people's livelihood. First of all, coal production will be more than doubled or tripled this year compared to the present. At present, drilling work is being carried out vigorously in new coalfields. In particular, thanks to the assistance of the people of the fraternal countries, many coal mines such as Aoji, Anju, and Samsin will use a large number of new machinery and equipment. This will rapidly increase the mining rate, improve the working conditions of workers, and fully meet the domestic demand for coal.
    The modernization of our country's industry will bring about qualitative changes in the development of our country's industry. We have many favorable conditions for the early restoration and construction of our country's heavy industry. Our country's laying the foundation for future industrialization and opening up broad prospects requires our people to display a new spirit of labor and dedication.
    Our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung once taught us:
      "Now everything depends on our own ability to organize, lead, create and practice. Our future achievements depend on how we correctly, most rationally and effectively utilize these conditions.
   "Under the conditions of correctly calculating our own capabilities, materials, funds and technical possibilities and other actual strength and internal sources, the proportion of various tasks, and various possibilities, in order to scientifically, skillfully, and correctly utilize the precious assistance of the fraternal countries, we must carry out our restoration and construction work step by step, foreseeably, and in a planned manner. First of all, we must formulate a three-year plan for the restoration and construction of the people's economy, and mobilize all forces to strive for its realization from 1954."
    We will certainly follow the instructions of the leader, actively display the creativity and patriotic dedication of the masses in the restoration and construction of the people's economy with the tense posture mobilized in the war, and strive to complete the first year of the post-war three-year plan for the people's economy—the 1954 plan.

    朝鲜重工业的恢复和发展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国重工业相　金斗三
    朝鲜人民在反对美英帝国主义武装侵略者、保卫自由与独立的斗争中取得历史性的胜利以后，为了祖国的和平统一，为了把被战争所破坏的人民经济恢复到战前的水平并为其进一步发展创造必要的条件，已经开始了恢复和发展人民经济三年计划（一九五四——一九五六年）建设的第一年。这就是说，我国已经走上了为将来的工业化打下基础的道路。
    在完成恢复和建设被战争破坏的人民经济这一全民的任务方面，我们有一个有利的条件，就是苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家所提供的巨大的兄弟般的援助。
    在这些援助当中，只从工业方面来看，我国今后就将会有许多工厂、发电厂和煤矿恢复起来，从前我国根本没有的工厂也将新建起几十个。
    根据这些援助，将会消除我国工业上过去殖民地性的畸形状态，保障其独立性。被破坏的工厂和企业，并不是按原样恢复，而是使许多重工业工厂、企业——我国人民经济发展的骨干，在现代化的最新式技术的基础上修复、改建和扩充起来。
    我国人民经济的主要部门，将在最近三、四年内以现代化的生产技术装备起来，并向更高的阶段发展，为我国将来工业化打下巩固的物质基础，借以加速我国工业发展的速度。由于有了各兄弟国家的援助，我国的重工业将会迅速修复和建设起来。
    首先，在金属工业部门，苏联政府决定无偿地修复和建设包括清津炼钢厂、金策炼钢厂、南浦冶炼厂等黑色及有色冶金工厂。苏联政府帮助我们进行从勘测、设计一直到技术指导和工厂开工的所有工作。现在，恢复和建设所需要的建设机械、电气设备及其他器材，正源源不断地运到我国。
    金属工业部门的工人、技术人员和职员们，正倾注全力修复破坏了的生产设备，并为大规模开展重建、扩建工作做好准备工作——调查整理工作。
    现在，清津炼钢厂已经保障了出钢、压延、成型等一系列的生产作业；金策炼钢厂的炼钢炉和炼焦炉已经投入生产；南浦冶炼厂将自今年开始生产铜条。此外，韩国模同志领导的工厂一方面集中力量进行平炉的修复工作，另一方面并已开始了钢板的生产。李奎凤同志领导的工厂正生产着钢块。文弼模同志领导的工厂，将在一九五四年生产电气用铅。
    由于伟大苏联的巨大援助，我国的黑色、有色金属冶金工业不久就会消除日本帝国主义统治时的殖民地畸形状态和技术落后性，而代之以现代化的设备和先进技术。这样一来，我们就能生产充分满足国内要求的钢材，如钢管、钢轨、车轮及其它辗压钢材，并进一步发展与苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家间的经济联系。
    在劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导下，重工业部门早在战争期间就为战后人民经济的恢复与发展做了准备，机器工业就是这样。因此，战后以苏联为首的各兄弟国家人民援助的机器设备有一部分已经进行生产了。这为今后在短时期内迅速发展机器工业打下了基础。
    机器工业的发展，在加强国防力量方面有着重要的意义，是将来我国工业化的基本条件。正因为如此，党和政府特别重视机器工业的发展，并采取了一面从国外大量输入工作母机，一面集中使用国内工作母机和工厂设备的措施。
    机器工业在战后由于有以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的援助，不久的将来我们就会有自己生产工作母机、发动机、电气机械、汽车零件、工具、水泵、铸管、马达、变压器、电线、电缆等的工厂。例如，我们将有拖拉机修理厂、汽车零件厂、发动机引擎工厂、工具工厂、工作母机制造厂、电气用具制造厂等。这将为我们自己亲手扩建新工厂和增加设备造成有利的条件。
    我国金属及机器工业的迅速发展，将成为发展其它所有工业和农业的巩固的基础。
    为适应金属工业的迅速恢复和发展，战后必须充分注意迅速发展矿业，开发我国丰富的地下资源。现在，我国在矿业的发展方面，已经打开了一条广阔的道路。
    从今年开始，已经有几十支以苏联地质探矿科学技术武装起来的、具备苏联最新式钻探机的地质勘探队，积极进行重点勘探。这将会给我国地下资源的开发带来划时代的发展。
    同时，停战以后，成兴、检德、成川、谷山以及其它各矿山，已经重点地修复了，其设备与技术也有计划地作了改进。特别是将上述四个矿山的选矿厂修建了起来，消除了技术的落后性和经济上的不合理状况，显著地提高了选矿率和实际生产率，并节省了人力。
    在战争中浸了水的矿山，将在最近一两年内恢复并开始生产。我国矿山的产品不但能保障国内恢复建设方面的需要，并且还可以向外输出。
    我们还可以估计到与工业发展、人民生活有着密切关系的煤炭工业的迅速发展。首先煤的生产量将在一九五四年年内比现在提高两三倍以上。目前正大力进行着新煤田的钻探工作。特别是由于各兄弟国家人民的援助，阿吾地、安州、三神等许多煤矿，将会大量使用新式机械和设备。这样就会飞速地提高开采率，改善工人的劳动条件，充分满足国内对煤炭的需要。
    我国工业的现代化，将会使我国工业的发展发生质的变化。我们有着许多使我国重工业早日实现恢复与建设的有利条件，我国为将来工业化打下基础和开辟广阔的前途，要求我国人民发挥新的劳动精神和献身精神。
    我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅曾教导我们：
      “现在一切都在于我们自己组织，领导，创造及实践的能力如何了。我们今后的成果如何，就在于我们怎样正确而最合理、有效地来利用这些条件了。
   “我们在正确计算本身的能力、资材、资金和技术上的可能性等实际力量和内部源泉、各种工作的比重以及各种可能性的条件下，为了科学地、熟练地、正确地利用各兄弟国家的高贵的援助，按步就班地、有预见性地、有计划地进行我们的恢复建设工作，首先要制订恢复、建设人民经济的三年计划，并从一九五四年起动员一切力量为其实现而奋斗。”
    我们一定会遵循着领袖的指示，以战争中动员起来的紧张姿态，在恢复、建设人民经济方面积极发挥群众的创造性和爱国献身精神，为完成战后人民经济三年计划的第一年——一九五四年的计划而努力。
