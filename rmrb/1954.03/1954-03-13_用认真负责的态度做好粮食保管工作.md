    Do a good job in grain storage with a serious and responsible attitude

    Editor's note: The grain purchasing work in various places has basically ended. Doing a good job in grain storage and ensuring that the grain in storage is not lost is an important task of the grain department. Many readers' letters reflect that grain departments in various places have paid attention to this work, and some have created some experiences and achieved good results. However, some areas still have some shortcomings in grain storage work. The following is a summary of three readers' letters, reflecting the situation that some grain cadres neglect storage work. It should be pointed out that the task of grain storage is arduous and there are difficulties; however, as long as cadres can be educated to improve their sense of responsibility and actively find ways to overcome difficulties, the work can be done well. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to this, strengthen inspection and supervision work, and ensure the safety of grain in storage.
    (I)
    Tan Churih and Liu Zhongnian from the Grain Bureau of Liling County, Hunan Province wrote: The characteristics of this year's grain storage work are many points, wide coverage, and large quantities. In addition, there was a lot of rain in the fourth quarter of last year, which caused some of the grain stored to have a high moisture content. In December last year, we conducted an inspection of all the stored grain and found that many grains had a moisture content of more than 15%, and a small amount of stored grain had even begun to mold and heat up. However, some grain depot staff still have some harmful thoughts. For example, some comrades felt relaxed after the grain was put into storage. They said, "We have been busy with the grain purchase and storage work for a while, and now it is time to take a break." Some comrades saw that some stored grain had problems, and instead of taking active and effective measures to deal with it, they wanted to wait for an opportunity to transfer the grain out, thinking that as long as it was transferred out, "everything would be fine." Some comrades also believe that "if the grain is not well stored, the local party and government leading organs will also be responsible, and it is not entirely their own responsibility if the grain is spoiled." In order to overcome these negative and paralyzing thoughts and do a good job in grain storage, the Liling County Grain Bureau, in addition to actively dealing with the stored grain with problems, also held a county-wide meeting of grain cadres to educate everyone to correct the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and improve the storage of grain.
    (II)
    Sun Yuan and Wang Xing from the Dezhou Prefectural Grain Bureau of Shandong wrote: Some cadres in charge of grain storage in Xiajin, Pingyuan, Deping, and Shanghe counties in Dezhou Prefecture are ideologically paralyzed and have abandoned the inspection of stored grain, resulting in some grain being lost. For example, the wheat in Yulichangtun Grain Depot in Xiajin County was put into storage during the summer tax last year. In October last year, it was found that the moisture content was very high and the insect damage was serious. Although it was sorted out once at that time, the moisture content had not reached the safe standard, and the insect damage had not been completely eliminated. After entering winter, the temperature and humidity in many stacks continued to rise, and the insect damage became more and more serious, but the grain depot cadres did not pay attention to this situation. It was not until the depot was instructed by its superiors to dismantle the stacks in December last year that it was discovered that the stored grain had suffered a lot of losses. Another example is that a lot of corn stored in the Duanji Grain Depot in Shanghe County during the autumn tax last year had high moisture content, but they did not store it separately from the grain with less moisture when it was stored in the warehouse, and there was no special person in charge of inspection and storage. It was not until the warehouse was inspected on December 4 last year that it was discovered that some of the grain had deteriorated and rotted. After the problem occurred, Li Shouyue, the director of the depot, and Wang Zefu, the storekeeper, not only did not take a serious and responsible attitude to rescue the grain, but instead mixed the moldy and deteriorated grain into the good grain and asked the county grain bureau to transfer it out in an attempt to cover up their mistakes and shirk their responsibilities.
    (III)
    Chen Xiangyu from the People's Government of Shishou County, Hubei Province wrote: Not long ago, our county conducted a key inspection of the stored grain and found that there were many problems in the grain storage work. For example, a small amount of grain in the warehouse of a cooperative in one district was heating up, moldy, and sprouting. The reasons for this situation, in addition to the simple equipment of many warehouses and the excessive moisture content of some stored grain, are mainly that some county and district leaders and warehouse staff did not take an active and responsible attitude towards grain storage. It is very common for grain depot staff to not go to the warehouse to check the grain situation for five or six days, and there was even a warehouse where the rice had been sprouting for a long time, but the warehouse staff did not know it.

### 用认真负责的态度做好粮食保管工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    用认真负责的态度做好粮食保管工作
    编者按：各地购粮工作已经基本结束。做好粮食保管工作，保证入库粮食不受损失，是粮食部门的一个重要任务。很多读者来信反映，各地粮食部门对这个工作已经加以重视，有的还创造了一些经验，得到了很好的成绩；但是，还有某些地区在粮食保管工作中有着一些缺点。下面摘要发表的三封读者来信，反映了某些粮食干部忽视保管工作的情况。应该指出：粮食保管工作的任务是艰巨的，困难也是有的；但是，只要能够教育干部提高工作责任心，积极想办法来克服困难，工作是可以做好的。希望各地对此引起注意，并加强检查督促工作，保证入库粮食的安全。
    （一）
    湖南省醴陵县粮食管理局谭锄日、刘钟年来信：今年粮食保管工作的特点是点多、面广、数量大，加之去年第四季度多雨，致使部分入库粮食水分很高。去年十二月，我们曾对全部库存粮食进行了一次检查，发现不少粮食含水量在百分之十五以上，而少数存粮甚至已开始发霉和发热。但是，某些粮库工作人员却还有着一些有害的思想。如有些同志在粮食入库后产生了松劲思想，他们说，“购粮入库工作忙了一阵子，现在该休息休息了”。有些同志见到部分存粮发生了问题，不是采取积极有效的措施来设法处理，却想等机会把粮食外调，认为只要调出门就“万事大吉”了。还有些同志认为“粮食保管不好当地党、政领导机关也要负责，坏了粮也不完全是自己的责任。”为了克服这些消极麻痹思想，做好粮食保管工作，醴陵县粮食管理局除积极处理有问题的存粮外，并召开了全县粮食干部会议，教育大家纠正上述错误思想，改进对粮食的保管工作。
      （二）
    山东德州专署粮食局孙源、王兴起来信：德州专区的夏津、平原、德平、商河等县某些做粮食保管工作的干部思想麻痹，放弃了对库存粮食的检查工作，以致部分粮食受到损失。如夏津县于里长屯粮库的小麦是去年夏征入库的，去年十月份发现水分很高和虫害严重，当时虽然进行了一次整理，但水分还未达到安全标准，虫害也未净绝。入冬后，不少囤内的温度、潮气不断增高，虫害也日益严重，但粮库干部对这种情况毫不重视。直到去年十二月该库奉上级指示进行拆垛时，才发现存粮已经受到不少损失。又如商河县段集粮库去年秋征入库的不少玉米水分较大，但他们存仓时却不与水分较少的粮食分放，也无专人负责检查保管，直到去年十二月四日检查仓库时，才发现有部分粮食已经变质、霉烂。而该库主任李守学和保管员王泽福等在问题发生后，不但没有采取认真负责的态度进行抢救，相反地还将已经霉烂和变质的粮食掺入好粮内，要求县粮食局外调，企图掩饰错误，推卸责任。
   （三）
    湖北省石首县人民政府陈祥瑜来信：不久前，我县曾对库存粮食进行了一次重点检查，发现粮食保管工作中的问题是不少的。如一区合作社的仓库就有少数粮食发热、霉烂和生芽。造成这种情况的原因，除了不少仓库设备简陋，某些入库粮食水分过多以外，主要是部分县、区领导同志和仓库工作人员对粮食保管工作没有采取积极负责的态度，粮库工作人员五、六天不去仓库检查粮食情况是很普遍的事，甚至有一个仓库稻谷生芽已很久，而该库工作人员还不知道。
