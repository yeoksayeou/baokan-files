    Strive to Successfully Complete This Year's Cultural and Educational Undertaking Plan

    This year is the second year of our country's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. Our cultural and educational work must further enhance its planning, better develop key undertakings, and attend to all aspects in order to serve our country's general line during the transition period more effectively. To this end, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council convened a national cultural and educational work conference from the 12th to the 23rd of this month. In an atmosphere full of unity and self-criticism, based on the general line of the transition period and the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, the conference examined the strengths and weaknesses of the 1953 cultural and educational work, discussed and determined the guidelines, tasks, and annual plan for the 1954 cultural and educational work, preliminarily discussed the main indicators of the Five-Year Cultural and Educational Construction Plan, and fully exchanged opinions on several major practical issues. This conference has significant meaning and effect on the improvement of future cultural and educational work and the strengthening of the unity of the cultural and educational ranks.

    Last year's cultural and educational work, under the leadership and concern of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the correct work policy of "readjustment and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady progress," corrected certain tendencies of blind development, clearly stipulated the specific guidelines for many tasks, and carried out a series of readjustments and improvements in a focused manner, achieving remarkable results and valuable experience. Experience tells us that conscientiously formulating and implementing annual plans and acting according to plan is indeed an important guarantee for improving work. The sign of the strength of planning lies not only in whether there is an annual plan, but more importantly in whether the annual plan is practical. To formulate a relatively practical plan, it is first necessary to understand the situation, which is a very important point. In the absence of experience in planning, last year's cultural and educational undertaking plan underwent repeated revisions in the process of actual work. The process of formulating and revising the plan was also a process of gradually understanding the situation, gradually overcoming bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism. Leading cadres at all levels of cultural and educational departments gradually clearly recognized the correct position of the current cultural and educational undertaking in the entire national construction undertaking, the errors of the ideas of rash advance and conservatism, and the importance of ensuring the rational development of key undertakings and attending to all aspects in the process of formulating, revising, and implementing the plan, thereby greatly improving the ideological and work levels of the leading organs of cultural and educational departments at all levels. Experience also tells us that criticism and self-criticism are indeed powerful weapons for promoting work. In the "New Three-Anti" struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, with leading organs and leading cadres as the focus, the cultural and educational system generally conducted more in-depth reviews of work, promoted democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, exposed and criticized shortcomings and errors in work, summarized work experience, improved leadership work, enhanced the initiative, enthusiasm, organization, and discipline of cadres, and strengthened the unity of the cultural and educational ranks. These successful experiences should be promoted and developed in future cultural and educational work.

    This year, our cultural and educational work should follow the general line of the country's transition period, based on the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, and continue to implement the work policy of "readjustment and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady progress" on the basis of existing work. This is in line with practical requirements. Although our cultural and educational work has undergone major improvements, it is still not adapted to the needs of national economic construction and the people's growing demands for culture and education. The quality of some work is not high, some key undertakings are not prominent enough, some undertakings that should be readjusted have not been readjusted, the specific guidelines for some work are not clear, some actual situations have not been understood, and some practical problems that should be solved have not been well resolved. This situation requires us to fully absorb past work experience, further implement the correct work policy with a high degree of enthusiasm, and pay special attention to the quality of work and the rational development of key undertakings, so that cultural and educational undertakings can more effectively serve national construction.

    The main key to implementing this year's work policy and completing this year's work plan lies in strengthening leadership work, first and foremost in strengthening political and ideological leadership work. Cultural and educational workers are soldiers on the ideological front, and the strength or weakness of ideological leadership has a decisive impact on the strength or weakness of the cultural and educational ranks' combat effectiveness. Especially during the transition period, in the fierce struggle, either overt or covert, between socialist ideology and various non-socialist ideologies, the importance of ideological leadership is even more prominently displayed. However, in the leadership work of the cultural and educational system, political and ideological leadership is still the weakest link and must be vigorously improved. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party committee, cultural and educational departments at all levels should continue to carry out the study of the general line widely and in-depth, in connection with reality, constantly improve the political and ideological level of leading cadres at all levels of cultural and educational departments and all cultural and educational workers, and also conduct education on the general line and various policies for them through the deployment, inspection, and summary of various tasks, criticize various erroneous ideas that violate the spirit of the general line, correct certain bad tendencies of separating business and technology from politics, and various forms of arrogance and complacency. It is necessary to frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism in the spirit of opposing bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, and ensure the normal development of democratic life. In order to strengthen leadership, it is necessary to give full play to the collective wisdom and collective experience of leading cadres, establish and improve the system of collective leadership, and it must be combined with division of labor and responsibility to avoid falling into formalism. In order to implement leadership intentions and ensure the correct implementation of guidelines and policies, it is also necessary to strengthen specific leadership. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels of cultural and educational departments must frequently study theory, study policies, study business, systematically understand the actual situation, truly "know the score," and promptly summarize experience. Only in this way can we soberly grasp the key points, come up with ideas, find solutions, and help comrades at lower levels solve practical difficulties. Only in this way can we specifically understand the work and ideological situation of cadres, effectively educate cadres, train cadres, correctly select cadres, thereby continuously improving the work ability and enthusiasm of cadres.

    In order to successfully complete the cultural and educational undertaking plan, it is also necessary to further strengthen the unity of the cultural and educational ranks. Our cultural and educational ranks are basically united. We rely on this unity to achieve great victories on the cultural and educational front, and we must rely on the continuous strengthening of this unity to achieve more and greater victories. The basic key to strengthening unity lies in better implementing the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, so that the spirit of this policy is better reflected in all aspects. Communist Party members in the cultural and educational ranks, especially Party member leading cadres, must not only deeply recognize the significant role of non-Party scientists, educators, writers, artists, and the vast number of intellectuals in the national construction undertaking, deeply understand the arduousness and long-term nature of the ideological transformation of intellectuals, but also attach great importance to the significant progress that the vast number of intellectuals have already made in ideological transformation, and recognize their current ideological situation and practical demands. In recent years, general non-Party experts and cultural and educational cadres have greatly improved their sense of political responsibility, and are willing to take responsibility and contribute their strength practically in appropriate work positions. Therefore, not only should we take care of them in life and arrange appropriate working conditions for them, but more importantly, we should help them politically and in their work, affirm their work achievements, help them overcome difficulties, kindly criticize their shortcomings in a well-intentioned spirit, and sincerely cooperate and work with them, encourage them to criticize Communist Party members, humbly listen to their criticisms, learn from them, so that each other feels as close as family members everywhere, without any worries, encouraging and helping each other, and striving for the common cause. This is the true embodiment of the Party's policy towards intellectuals.

    All cultural and educational comrades, whether Party members or non-Party members, must correctly recognize the strengths and weaknesses of our country's intellectuals, and also recognize the complexity of the current social environment. All kinds of non-socialist ideological influences, especially the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, are constantly encroaching on us and want to occupy positions in our minds. We must constantly fight against this ideological influence. This is a profound, meticulous, and resolute struggle. We cannot avoid it because we want to move forward and build our motherland into a great socialist country. From this perspective, we can truly see the importance and necessity of criticism and self-criticism and consciously carry out ideological transformation. Only the unity formed on the basis of such a common idea is truly consolidated unity.

    The task of cultural and educational work in 1954 is arduous, and there are many difficulties, but firmly overcoming difficulties under the leadership of the Party, and continuously advancing in overcoming difficulties, is precisely the law of development of our revolutionary work. The important thing is to deeply understand the power of the collective and the masses, resolutely follow the mass line, patiently enlighten the consciousness of the masses, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. This is the key to overcoming any difficulties. The great gains of this conference have set a good example for our cultural and educational ranks. Let us strive with full confidence to successfully complete the 1954 cultural and educational undertaking plan.

### 为胜利完成今年文化教育事业计划而奋斗

    为胜利完成今年文化教育事业计划而奋斗
    今年是我国执行第一个五年计划的第二年。我国文化教育工作必须进一步提高计划性，更好地发展重点事业和照顾全面，以便更有效地为我国过渡时期的总路线服务。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会为此在本月十二日到二十三日召开了全国文教工作会议，在充满团结精神和批评与自我批评精神的气氛中，根据过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务，检查了一九五三年文教工作的优缺点，讨论和确定了一九五四年文教工作的方针、任务和年度计划，初步商谈了五年文教建设计划的主要指标，并在若干主要的实际问题上充分交换了意见。这个会议对于今后文教工作的改进和文教队伍团结的加强，都有重大的意义和作用。
    去年的文化教育工作，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导和关怀下，在“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的正确工作方针的指导下，纠正了某些盲目发展的偏向，明确规定了许多工作的具体方针，有重点地进行了一系列的整顿和改进工作，取得了显著的成绩和宝贵的经验。经验告诉我们：认真制订和执行年度计划，按计划办事，确是改进工作的重要保证。计划性强弱的标志，不仅在于有无年度计划，而更重要的是在于年度计划是否切合实际。要订出比较切合实际的计划，首先必须摸清情况，这是非常重要的一点。在我们缺乏计划工作经验的情况下，去年的文教事业计划曾在实际工作的过程中经过了反复的修订。制订和修订计划的过程，同时也是逐步摸清情况、逐步克服官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的过程。各级文教部门领导干部在制订、修订和执行计划的过程中逐步明确认识了当前文教事业在整个国家建设事业中的正确地位，认识了冒进思想和保守思想的错误，认识了保证重点事业合理发展和照顾全面的重要性，因而大大提高了各级文教领导机关的思想水平和工作水平。经验也告诉我们：批评和自我批评确是推动工作前进的有力武器。在以领导机关领导干部为重点的反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的“新三反”斗争中，文教系统一般都比较深入地检查了工作，发扬了民主，开展了批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，揭发和批判了工作中的缺点和错误，总结了工作经验，改进了领导工作，提高了干部的主动性、积极性、组织性和纪律性，加强了文教队伍的团结。这些成功的经验，在今后文教工作中应加以推广和发挥。
    今年我们的文教工作，应该遵循国家过渡时期的总路线，依据第一个五年计划的基本任务，在现有的工作基础上，继续贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针。这是符合实际的要求的。我们的文教工作虽然有了重大的改进，但还不能适应国家经济建设的需要和人民对文化教育的日益增长的要求。有些工作的质量还不高，有些重点事业还不够突出，有些应该整顿的事业还没有整顿，有些工作的具体方针还不明确，有些实际情况还没有摸清，有些应该解决的实际问题还没有很好地解决。这种情况要求我们充分吸收过去的工作经验，以高度的积极精神，进一步贯彻正确的工作方针，特别要注意工作的质量和重点事业的合理发展，使文教事业更有效地为国家建设服务。
    贯彻今年的工作方针、完成今年的工作计划的主要关键，在于加强领导工作，首先在于加强政治思想领导工作。文教工作人员是思想战线上的战士，思想领导的强弱，对于文教队伍战斗力的强弱，有着决定性的作用。特别在过渡时期，在社会主义思想与各种非社会主义思想的或明或暗的剧烈斗争中，思想领导的重要性，更加突出地显示出来了。可是在文教系统的领导工作中，政治思想领导仍是最薄弱的一环，必须大力加以改进。各级文教部门应在党委的领导和帮助下，联系实际，广泛、深入地继续开展总路线的学习，不断提高各级文教领导干部和全体文教工作人员的政治思想水平，而且要通过各项工作的布置、检查和总结，经常向他们进行总路线和各项政策的教育，批判各种违反总路线精神的错误思想，纠正某些业务、技术脱离政治的不良偏向和以各种形式表现出来的骄傲自满情绪。要经常以反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的精神，开展批评和自我批评，保证民主生活的正常开展。为了加强领导力量，必须发挥领导骨干的集体智慧和集体经验，必须建立和健全集体领导的制度，而且一定要和分工负责相结合，以免流于形式主义。为了贯彻领导意图，保证方针政策的正确执行，又必须加强具体领导。因此，文教部门各级领导干部都要经常学习理论，研究政策，钻研业务，系统地了解实际情况，真正做到“心中有数”，并及时地总结经验。只有这样，才能清醒地抓重点，出主意，想办法，帮助下级同志解决实际困难。也只有这样，才能具体了解干部的工作和思想情况，有效地教育干部、培养干部，正确地选拔干部，从而不断提高干部的工作能力和积极性。
    为了胜利完成文化教育事业计划，还必须进一步加强文教队伍的团结。我们的文教队伍基本上是团结的。我们依靠这个团结，已经在文教战线上取得了巨大的胜利，我们还得依靠这个团结的不断加强，取得更多更大的胜利。加强团结的基本关键在于更好地贯彻党对知识分子的团结和改造的政策，使这一政策的精神更好地在各方面体现出来。文教队伍中的共产党员，特别是党员领导干部，非但要深刻认识非党科学家、教育家、文学家、艺术家和广大知识分子对国家建设事业的重大作用，深切理解知识分子思想改造的艰巨性和长期性，而且要十分重视广大知识分子在思想改造上已经取得的显著进步，认识他们当前的思想情况和实际要求。几年以来，一般非党专家和文教干部都大大提高了自己的政治责任感，愿负起责任，在适当的工作岗位上切切实实地贡献自己的力量。因此不但要在生活上照顾他们，给他们安排适当的工作条件，而更重要的，还要在政治上和工作上帮助他们，肯定他们的工作成绩，帮助他们克服困难，以与人为善的精神，亲切地批评他们的缺点，并诚恳地与他们合作共事，鼓励他们对共产党员的批评，虚心地听取他们的批评意见，向他们学习，使彼此处处感觉亲如家人，无所顾虑，互勉互助，为共同事业而奋斗。这才是党对知识分子的政策的真正体现。
    全体文教工作同志，无论党员或非党员，都要正确认识我国知识分子的优点和弱点，也要认识当前社会环境的复杂性。各种各样非社会主义的思想影响，特别是资产阶级的思想影响，时时刻刻在侵袭着我们，要在我们的头脑里占领阵地，我们必须经常跟这种思想影响作斗争。这是深刻的、细致的、坚决的斗争，我们不能躲避它，因为我们要前进，要把我们的祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。从这样的角度看，便能真正看出批评和自我批评的重要性和必要性，便能自觉地进行思想改造。只有在这样的共同思想的基础上形成的团结，才是真正巩固的团结。
    一九五四年文教工作的任务是艰巨的，困难是很多的，但在党的领导下坚定不移地克服困难，在克服困难中不断前进，正是我们的革命工作的发展规律。重要的是：要深刻地理解集体和群众的力量，坚决走群众路线，耐心地启发群众的自觉，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，这便是战胜任何困难的关键所在。这次会议的巨大收获，给我们的文教队伍树立了良好的榜样，让我们满怀信心地为胜利完成一九五四年文教事业计划而奋斗吧。
