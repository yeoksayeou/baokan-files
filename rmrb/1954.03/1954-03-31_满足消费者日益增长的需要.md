    Meeting the Growing Needs of Consumers
    Transparent Silk Raincoats
    Last year, the Shenyang Textiles and Knitwear Store of the China Department Store used thin silk to process a batch of oilcloth, which was soft and transparent, and customers liked it very much. The first batch of silk oilcloth quickly sold out. This broad sales prospect caught the attention of Wang Yunyu, a salesperson, who thought it would be wonderful if these oilcloths were made into raincoats. He discussed this idea with his team members and then brought it up to the business section; coincidentally, the business section was also planning to make raincoats from silk oilcloth. In order to let people wear satisfactory raincoats, they also specially made samples for customers to evaluate. When this new product appeared in the clothing department, customers praised it.
    The department store is now carefully planning how many cloak-style and how many sleeved raincoats to make based on customer feedback, and has also specially processed some raincoats for children. In terms of color, they have also specially considered making blue ones for some people, light yellow ones for others, and pink ones for children.
    These inexpensive, beautiful, and new transparent silk raincoats will soon be available to customers in Shenyang.
      Light and Attractive Enamel Basins
    The local state-owned Xi'an People's Enamel Factory will supply a large number of enamel products needed by the people of Northwest China this year. The planned total output will increase by more than double compared to last year, and the prices will also be relatively cheaper. Buying a floral enamel basin in Xi'an is more than 15,000 yuan cheaper than a brass basin, so farmers can also use enamel basins. In particular, young men and women in rural areas choose to buy a brightly colored enamel basin when they get married. They all say: Enamel basins are light, attractive, and inexpensive.
    In January of this year alone, the Northwest District Company of the China Department Store supplied more than 53,000 enamel basins produced in Xi'an to the provinces of Northwest China, which is equal to 60% of the total sales in the first quarter of last year. According to the preferences of the people of various ethnic groups in Northwest China, especially the vast number of farmers, the workers of the enamel factory have added new patterns such as peonies, mandarin ducks, and goldfish to this year's production of basins; the tea mugs produced this year have also added more than a dozen patterns such as increasing production and practicing economy, industrial and agricultural construction drawings, and peace doves.
    Spring and Summer Clothing on the Shelves
    It is time to change clothes. The Qiqihar City Company of the China Department Store regards supplying people with satisfactory spring and summer clothing as the most important task at present. The business department and the shoe production cooperative have signed contracts for leather shoes and sandals, which will soon be available on the market. Various floral fabrics and colored fabrics from Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian, Shenyang, Xiong Yue and other places have also been continuously transported in.
      The Qiqihar City State-owned Second Department Store has removed winter goods from the windows and counters and replaced them with a large number of spring and summer clothes and timely goods. The First Department Store has imported more than 120 kinds of new products in seven days, and the number of shoes and hats suitable for spring alone has increased by 23 kinds. In order to meet the needs of women, the fabric group has added many new styles of fabrics such as Hong Kong Luo, Kaoshilin, Jinye Hua Da Ni, and poplin.
    The Variety of Undershirts and Vests Has Doubled
    The Liuzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store made a purchase plan for seasonal goods as early as the beginning of the year, and began to import a large number of summer supplies from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places in the first quarter, while carrying out local processing and procurement. In addition to underwriting all the products of the local state-owned Liuzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, such as socks and towels, the station also signed processing and ordering contracts for undershirts, vests, socks, mosquito nets, etc. with some private textile factories and handicraft cooperatives; 6,000 to 7,000 dozen T-shirts and vests and 4,000 to 5,000 mosquito nets were processed in Liuzhou City.
    When preparing summer supplies, they also specially expanded the variety of patterns and colors in the purchases. The variety of patterns and colors of undershirts and vests alone has doubled compared to last year. The first batch of processed goods has been transferred to various counties, and the Liuzhou Department Store has also put some seasonal goods on the counters and started to meet consumers.
    Producing a Large Number of Novel and Beautiful Clothing Materials
    Since last winter, Shanghai textile workers have started to produce a large number of novel and colorful spring and summer clothing materials, and these fabrics are being continuously transported to all parts of the country.
    Since last autumn, the entire private dyeing and weaving industry in Shanghai has accepted the state's underwriting. This year, factories will produce a large number of poplin, seersucker, Hong Kong Luo, and light-colored printed fabrics. The increased production of poplin alone can make 10 million shirts. The production volume of light-colored floral fabrics and floral linen yarn can be paved 50 or 60 layers flat on the railway from Shanghai to Beijing.
    This year, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has conducted in-depth research on the characteristics and uses of various cotton fabric products, and changed its production methods and product specifications. The original printed poplin was printed by hand, but this year some of it has been changed to machine printing. The printed floral poplin is clear, beautiful, and washable. Floral poplin used to be woven with thread, but now it is woven with yarn, and the texture is the same as before. A large amount of cotton has been saved and the supply has been expanded.
      New "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" Floral Fabric
    In front of the floral fabric counter of the First Branch of the Andong City Company of the China Department Store, there was a crowd of customers selecting and purchasing. People were praising: This phoenix is ​​really beautiful! An old lady said to the young girl next to her: "I'll buy you this kind of floral fabric for your wedding to make a quilt cover, it's beautiful and cheap!" A salesperson held a roll of red-ground floral fabric with phoenixes and introduced it to the customers: "This floral fabric is printed by the State-owned Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory." After hearing this, the customers happily said: "The Northeast can also produce such beautiful floral fabrics now."
    In the past, the floral fabrics dyed by the Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory were not so popular, the colors were old and the patterns were outdated, and sales were slow. Customers had many opinions. Later, the floral fabric team collected these opinions and wrote a letter to the Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory. The letter was replied soon after it was sent. The reply read: "We are very happy to receive your feedback from consumers on the floral serge fabric produced by our factory. Now, according to the opinions of consumers, we have printed a large floral serge 'Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix' floral fabric. We are sending a sample of the floral fabric, please solicit the opinions of consumers for further research and improvement."
    The next day, when this fabric sample appeared on the sample rack, it was welcomed by people. One said: "I have never seen such a beautiful floral fabric." Another asked: "When will this floral fabric be shipped here?" That night, the salespeople wrote a letter hoping that the Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory would produce this floral fabric in a timely manner. Sure enough, twenty days later, the "Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" floral fabric that everyone longed for was shipped.
    Native Produce Company Also Prepared Seasonal Goods
    Since November of last year, the Shandong Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company has been actively organizing a large number of summer goods. The quantity of summer supplies prepared by the company this year has greatly increased compared to last year. At the same time, paper fans, palm leaf fans (banana leaf fans), straw slippers, mosquito net poles, etc. have also been added to the variety. These supplies are purchased according to the varieties, specifications, brands, and characteristics needed by the masses. The straw mats and bamboo mats that were purchased in the past were often too big for one person and too small for two people; this year, most of the mats suitable for single and double use were selected. When purchasing umbrellas, attention was paid not only to the patterns, but also to being strong and durable.
    At the same time, the Shandong Provincial Company has made appropriate arrangements for the quantity, variety, and color distribution of materials between regions within the province.

    满足消费者日益增长的需要
    透明的丝绸雨衣
    中国百货公司沈阳市布匹呢绒商店，去年曾用薄丝绸加工了一批油布，又柔软又透明，顾客都很喜欢。第一批丝绸油布很快就卖光了。这样广阔的销路，引起了营业员王云禹的注意，他想若用这些油布加工成雨衣那可美极了。他把这个意见和小组的同志商量后，便提到了业务股；可巧，业务股也正在计划用丝绸油布制雨衣的事。他们为了让人民穿上满意的雨衣，还特意试制了样子让顾客鉴定。当这件新产品出现在服装部时，顾客们都称赞不已。
    百货公司现在正根据顾客的意见，仔细地计划着做多少斗篷式的，多少带袖的，还特意给孩子们加工了一些雨衣。在颜色方面，也特别考虑了给那些人做蓝色的，又给那些人做浅黄的，和给孩子们做粉红的。
    这些便宜美观、新的丝绸透明雨衣，不久就要和沈阳市的顾客见面了。
      轻巧好看的搪瓷花脸盆
    地方国营西安人民搪瓷厂，今年将大量供应西北人民所需的搪瓷用品，总产量计划将比去年增加一倍多，而且价钱也比较便宜。在西安市上买一个花搪瓷盆，比熟铜盆便宜一万五千多元，农民们也可以使用搪瓷脸盆了。特别是农村的青年男女结婚时，都要选购一个花色鲜艳的搪瓷脸盆，他们都说：搪瓷脸盆轻巧、好看、又便宜。
    中国百货公司西北区公司仅在今年一月份供应西北各省的西安出产的搪瓷脸盆就有五万三千多个，等于去年第一季度销售总数的百分之六十。搪瓷厂的工人们，根据西北各族人民，特别是广大农民的喜爱，已将今年生产的脸盆增加了牡丹、鸳鸯、金鱼等新花样；今年生产的茶缸也增加了增产节约，工农业建设图、和平鸽等十几种图样。
    春装夏服摆上柜台
    更换服装的时候到了。中国百货公司齐齐哈尔市公司把供应给人们可心的春装、夏服作为目前一项最重要的工作。业务科和靴鞋生产合作社签订了皮鞋、凉鞋等合同，这些鞋不久即可上市。来自上海、青岛、大连、沈阳、熊岳等地的各种花布、色布，也源源运到了。
      齐齐哈尔市国营第二百货商店已把在窗橱和柜台上的冬货撤下，换上了大批春装夏服和适时的货物。第一百货商店在七天内进了一百二十多种新商品，光适合春天用的鞋帽就增加了二十三种。布匹组为了供应妇女们的需要，新添了香港罗、靠士林、金叶花达呢、府绸等好多新式的布。
    汗衫背心花色品种增加一倍
    中国百货公司柳州采购供应站早在年初便作了换季商品的进货计划，并在第一季度开始时就一面由上海、广州等地调进了大批夏季物资，一面进行了就地加工采购。该站除包销了地方国营柳州染织厂的全部产品袜子毛巾外，并和一些私营纺织厂及手工业合作社签订了汗衫、背心、袜子、蚊帐等加工订货合同；在柳州市就加工了文化衫、背心六、七千打、蚊帐四、五千顶。
    他们在准备夏季物资时，还特地扩大了进货中的花色品种，仅汗衫、背心的花色品种就比去年增加了一倍左右。现在加工的第一批商品已调运到各县去了，柳州百货商店也将部分换季物资放在柜台上开始和消费者见面了。
    生产大量新颖美丽的衣料
    上海纺织工人从去年冬季就开始生产大量新颖、艳丽的春夏季衣料，这些布匹，正源源运往全国各地。
    从去年秋天起，上海私营染织业全部接受了国家的包销，今年各工厂将大量生产府绸、泡泡纱、香港罗和浅色印花布，仅增产的府绸就可以做一千万件衬衫。浅色花布和花麻纱的生产量，可以在从上海到北京的铁道上平铺五、六十层。
    中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站，今年曾深入研究了各种棉布产品的特性和用途，改变它的生产方法和产品规格。原来的印花府绸是用手工印花的，今年有一部分改用机器印花，印出来的花府绸清晰美观，而且耐洗。花府绸过去用线织，现在改为用纱织，质地和过去相同。节约了大量用棉，扩大了供应。
      “百鸟朝凤”的新花布
    中国百货公司安东市公司第一门市部放花纱布的柜台前面，挤满了选购的顾客。人们都在称赞着：这凤凰可真美透了！一位老太太对身旁的年轻姑娘说：“你结婚时就给你买这种花布做被面吧，又好看又便宜！”一位营业员拿着一卷红地带凤凰的花布，向顾客介绍说：“这花布是国营熊岳印染厂印染的。”顾客们听了以后高兴地说：东北也能出产这样好看的花布啦。
    过去，熊岳印染厂染的花布并不是这样受欢迎，颜色陈旧，花样古老，销售不快。顾客们有很多意见。以后花纱布小组把这些意见搜集起来，写信给熊岳印染厂。信发了不久就收到了回信。回信写着：“接到你们反映消费者对我厂出品的花哔叽布的意见，我们十分高兴。现在我们根据消费者的意见印染了大花哔叽‘百鸟朝凤’花布。寄上花布样子，请你们征求一下消费者的意见，好进一步研究改进。”
    第二天，当这块花布样在样品架上出现后，受到了人们的欢迎。这个说：“从来没有看见过这样好看的花布。”那个问：“这种花布什么时候能运来？”当天晚上，营业员们就写了一封希望熊岳印染厂及时生产这种花布的信。果然在二十天以后，大家渴望的“百鸟朝凤”花布运来了。
    土产公司也准备了时令货
    中国土产公司山东省公司从去年十一月份起，就积极组织大量夏令货。该公司今年所准备的夏令物资的数量比去年大为增加。同时，在品种上还增添了纸扇、葵扇（芭蕉扇）、草拖鞋、蚊帐杆等。这些物资都是根据群众所需要的品种、规格、牌号和特点进货的。过去所进的草席、竹席往往是一个人铺嫌大，两个人铺又嫌小；今年大部选择了适合单人和双人用的席子，雨伞的进货，不但注意花样，而且特别注意了坚固耐用。
    同时，山东省公司对省内地区间的物资数量、品种、花色的分布，都作了适当的安排。
