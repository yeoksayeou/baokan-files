    Guangdong Chaozhou Mandarin Orange Exports Increase Annually

    The total value of Chaozhou mandarin oranges exported to the Soviet Union by the Guangdong Branch of the China National Food Corporation in the fourth quarter of 1953 and the first quarter of 1954 can be exchanged for 536 trucks with a load capacity of 12,000 jin, or 407 tractors.

    Due to the increasingly strengthened economic ties between China and the Soviet Union, the export volume of Chaozhou mandarin oranges from Guangdong to the Soviet Union has increased year by year: the export volume of Chaozhou mandarin oranges in 1952 increased by 72.34 percent compared with 1951, and in 1953 it increased by 60 percent compared with 1952, which increased the enthusiasm of orange-growing farmers for production. In 1953, the total output of fresh oranges in the entire region increased sevenfold compared with 1950. As a result, farmers' incomes have increased, with the income of Chaozhou-Shantou farmers from growing oranges alone reaching more than 80 billion yuan.

    The employees of the Guangdong Branch of the China National Food Corporation have also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in the work of purchasing fresh oranges and exporting them. All fresh orange processing factories have launched an increase production and conservation campaign to improve product quality, improve specifications, reduce orange spoilage, and reduce the loss of processing raw materials, so that the average spoilage rate of sixteen batches of Chaozhou mandarin oranges when they arrived in Manchuria was only 0.17 percent. This ensured the fulfillment of the Chaozhou mandarin orange export task with quality, on time, and exceeding the target.

    广东潮州柑出口量逐年增加
    中国食品公司广东省公司在一九五三年第四季度和一九五四年第一季度对苏联输出的潮州柑，其总值可换回五百三十六辆载重一万二千斤的运货汽车，或四百零七部拖拉机。
    由于中国和苏联的经济联系日益加强，广东的潮州柑对苏联出口数量逐年增加：一九五二年潮州柑出口量比一九五一年增加百分之七十二点三四，一九五三年又比一九五二年增加百分之六十，从而提高了种柑农民生产积极性。一九五三年全区生柑产量比一九五○年增加七倍。农民的收入因此有所增加，单是潮汕农民种柑的收入就达八百多亿元。
    中国食品公司广东省公司的职工在收购生柑和出口的工作中也发挥了高度积极性，各生柑加工厂展开了提高产品质量、改善规格、减少柑果腐烂、减少加工原料损耗的增产节约运动，使十六批潮州柑运到满洲里时的腐烂率，平均仅为千分之一点七。保证了按质、按时和超额完成潮州柑出口的任务。
