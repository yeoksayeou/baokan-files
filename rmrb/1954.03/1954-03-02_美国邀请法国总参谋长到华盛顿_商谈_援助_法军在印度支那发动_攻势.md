Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The U.S. Department of Defense has invited French Chief of Staff Ély to Washington to discuss the issue of French forces launching an "offensive" in Indochina. According to a United Press Washington dispatch, the U.S. Department of Defense is "eager" to obtain from Ély the full quantity of equipment and assistance needed for the "next military offensive" to be launched in Indochina. The U.S. Department of Defense "is currently estimating the costs of the current campaign in order to estimate the costs of the next campaign beginning after the rainy season in October of this year." The U.S. Department of Defense intends to have "everything ready" when the French forces launch their "offensive." U.S. military authorities are extremely unwilling for the upcoming Geneva Conference to achieve a ceasefire in Indochina. According to United Press, "The Department of Defense hopes that the Geneva Conference will not prompt Congress to disapprove the large appropriation for Indochina in the next fiscal year's budget, starting July 1." The U.S. Department of Defense is concerned that "any indication that the conference might bring peace or a ceasefire to Indochina could influence Congress to decide to reduce the requested appropriation, which would seriously affect the next campaign in Indochina."

    商谈“援助”法军在印度支那发动“攻势”
   【新华社一日讯】美国国防部已邀请法国总参谋长埃利前往华盛顿，商谈法军在印度支那发动“攻势”问题。合众社华盛顿消息说，美国国防部“急于”要从埃利那里获知在印度支那展开的“下一军事攻势”所需要的装备和援助的全部数量。美国国防部“现在正在估计目前战役的费用，以便估计今年十月雨季以后开始的下一战役的费用”。美国国防部打算要在法军发动“攻势”的时候，“一切东西准备齐全”。美国军事当局极不愿意行将举行的日内瓦会议能使印度支那实现停战。据合众社说，“国防部希望日内瓦会议不会促使国会不通过在从七月一日起的下一会计年度的预算中给予印度支那的大笔拨款。”美国国防部担心：“任何表明会议可能使印度支那实现和平或停战的迹象都可能影响国会，使它决定减少所要求的拨款，这将会严重地影响印度支那的下一战役。”
