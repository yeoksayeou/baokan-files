Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: In order to combine grassroots elections to complete China's population census and registration work, the Central Election Committee Office and the Central Population Census and Registration Office, as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Statistical Bureau of the Central People's Government recently issued two joint notices to all provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, requiring all localities to conscientiously do a good job in population census and registration. Both notices pointed out that as of the end of 1953, the national population census and registration had completed the survey of 29% of the total national population, and more than 70% of the population had to be completed this spring in conjunction with grassroots elections. However, due to the urgency of time and the heavy workload, coupled with the fact that the standard time of 24:00 on June 30, 1953, is more than half a year away, all areas that have not completed the population census and registration must quickly transfer cadres, improve the organizational structure of the population census and registration office, strengthen leadership, promptly supervise and inspect, and adopt simple registration methods that facilitate the masses, so as to obtain accurate population figures from this survey. In addition to stipulating that the population census and registration offices of all provinces and cities should establish a system of reporting to the Central Population Census and Registration Office at any time, the notice also specifically pointed out the following four points that should be noted:

    1. It is necessary to educate cadres to truly understand that the national population census and registration is not only an important requirement of this general election, but also that population figures are an important basis for the country's planned economic construction. Any sloppy approach will not only affect the progress of this general election work, but also, for a considerable period of time, prevent the country from obtaining accurate population figures as a basis for compiling various construction plans.

    2. The name, gender, age, and ethnicity of the permanent residents must be clearly registered, to prevent some areas from being eager to achieve quick results, registering sloppily, or even adopting perfunctory practices such as estimation.

    3. On the principle of doing a good job in registration, the registration methods can be carried out in simple ways that facilitate the masses according to the specific conditions of each place. In rural areas, due to the heavy work of spring plowing and production, it is possible to adopt the method of dividing the registration stations into smaller units and setting up more mobile registration stations, combining production, and simultaneously publicizing, registering, and verifying. Cities should still carry out registration in accordance with the original regulations since they are not affected by spring plowing and production work.

    4. The floating population can be registered according to the situation at the time of the survey, without tracing back to the standard time. In calculating age, the following simple methods can be adopted: Because the Spring Festival has passed, in places where age is calculated according to the nominal age, those born before the standard time should subtract two years, and those born after the standard time should subtract three years. If some registration personnel cannot convert on the spot, they can also register each person's date of birth and zodiac sign in the remarks column, and then convert the age after registration. The above two methods shall be implemented by each locality for its own reference.

In order to effectively carry out the population census and registration work, the Central Election Committee Office and the Central Population Census and Registration Office have recently dispatched three working groups to Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces to inspect and assist in the work.

    中央选举委员会办公室和中央人口调查登记办公室等机关
    通知各地做好人口调查登记工作
    【新华社十日讯】为结合基层选举完成我国的人口调查登记工作，中央选举委员会办公室和中央人口调查登记办公室，以及中央人民政府内务部、公安部、国家统计局最近分别向各省、市及内蒙古自治区发出两件联合通知，要求各地认真做好人口调查登记工作。这两件通知都指出，全国人口调查登记截至一九五三年底止，已完成调查的占全国总人口的百分之二十九，还有百分之七十多的人口，要在今春结合基层选举完成。但由于时间紧迫，各项工作任务繁重，加以距离一九五三年六月三十日二十四时的标准时间达半年以上，所以凡未完成人口调查登记的地区，必须迅速抽调干部，健全人口调查登记办公室机构，加强领导，及时督促检查，并采取便利群众的简易登记办法，以便从这次调查中取得确实的人口数字。通知除了规定各省、市人口调查登记办公室应建立向中央人口调查登记办公室随时报告的制度外，还特别指出以下四点应注意的事项：
    一、必须教育干部，确实懂得全国人口调查登记，不仅是这次普选的一项重要要求，而且人口数字是国家进行有计划的经济建设的重要依据。一切潦草从事的做法，不仅会影响这次普选工作的进行，而且将在相当长的时期内，使国家在编制各项建设计划上，得不到准确人口数字的依据。
    二、必须将常住人口的姓名、性别、年龄、民族四项内容登记清楚，防止有些地区急于求成，潦草登记，甚至采用估算等敷衍的做法。
    三、在做好登记的原则下，登记方法可根据各地具体情况，采取便利群众的简易办法进行。农村中由于春耕生产等工作繁重，可采用将登记站划小和多设流动登记站，结合生产，边宣传、边登记、边核对的办法。城市因不受春耕生产工作的影响，仍应按照原规定办法进行登记。
    四、流动人口可按调查时情况进行登记，不再追溯标准时间。年龄的计算上，可采取下列简便办法：因过了春节，凡按虚岁计算年龄的地方，出生在标准时间前的，即应减两岁计算，出生在标准时间后的，即应减三岁计算。如有些登记人员不会当场折算，亦可采取把每个人的出生年月日和属象登记在备考栏，待登记后再折算周岁。以上两种办法，由各地自行参酌执行。
    为切实作好人口调查登记工作，中央选举委员会办公室和中央人口调查登记办公室最近已派出三个工作组，分赴河北、山东、安徽、湖北、湖南等省检查和帮助工作。
