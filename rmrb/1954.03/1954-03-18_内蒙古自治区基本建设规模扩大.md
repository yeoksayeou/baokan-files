    The scale of basic construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is expanding daily. According to preliminary statistics, the total basic construction area in the region this year is approximately 600,000 square meters, an increase of one-third compared to last year. In particular, the proportion of industrial basic construction has significantly increased. This year, the region plans to build or expand 45 local state-owned factories. In Baotou, the new industrial base of the motherland, ten new factories will be built and five factories will be expanded to serve heavy industrial basic construction. Most of these factories have new machinery and equipment, and the entire production process is mechanized or semi-mechanized. The Baotou Brick and Tile Factory is one such example. This is a modern brick and tile manufacturing plant of considerable scale, equipped with sixty annular kilns and one hundred and fifty horseshoe kilns, as well as large and medium-sized brick-making machines and other mechanized equipment. Manually, each person can produce a maximum of 500 bricks per day, but a medium-sized brick-making machine can produce 5,000 brick blanks per hour. The Baotou Quarry is also a factory that uses advanced machinery and equipment, including vertical and horizontal air compressors, pneumatic drills, stone crushers, and electric welding machines, as well as light rails, small locomotives, mine cars, and other mechanized transportation tools. The Baotou Lumber and Wood Products Factory, which will soon be built, will have various band saws, cutoff saws, pressure saws, planers, four-sided planers, power distribution rooms, drying rooms, paint wrapping workshops, wood wool board workshops, and wood wool conveyors. In addition, Baotou City is also building or expanding a small hardware manufacturing plant, an oxygen plant, an auto repair shop, a cement pipe factory, and a refractory material manufacturing plant this year.
    This year, new modern thermal power plants will be built in Baotou and Pingdi Spring respectively. The Gui Sui City Power Plant will also expand its original equipment by adding a 2,000-kilowatt turbine generator. In Xilinhot (Beizi Temple), Xilingol League, a small thermal power plant will be built this year to serve the factories and mines in Xilinhot in the future. A relatively large caustic soda plant is planned to be built within the territory of the Yikezhao League, and geological exploration will be started this year. After these two factories are put into production, they will bring economic prosperity to the nearby herdsmen. A mechanized frozen meat factory will appear in Hailar City this year. In Zhalantun, in addition to expanding the existing farm tool factory to increase the supply of agricultural production tools, a flour mill with an area of 40,000 square meters will also be built. Most of these projects are planned to start construction around May this year.
    The scale of urban construction in Inner Mongolia is also expanding. Many high-rise buildings will appear in Gui Sui City this year, and a department store joint market will be built. The Inner Mongolia Post and Telecommunications Administration will also expand an office building with an area of 2,500 square meters. A number of new buildings will also appear in Baotou, Hailar, and Pingdi Spring. At present, the design company under the Inner Mongolia Construction Engineering Bureau is designing a large number of economical, practical, beautiful, and durable architectural drawings for various cities. Seven cities, including Baotou, Gui Sui, Pingdi Spring, Hailar, Manzhouli, Xiguitu Banner, and Tongliao, will also establish urban construction committees to study and plan the future development plans of the cities.

    内蒙古自治区基本建设规模扩大
    内蒙古自治区的基本建设规模日益扩大。据初步统计，今年全区基本建设面积约有六十余万平方公尺，较去年增加了三分之一。特别是工业基本建设的比重已显著增长。全区今年计划新建、扩建的地方国营工厂有四十五座。在祖国新的工业基地包头市，即将新建十座工厂，扩建五座工厂，为重工业基本建设服务。这些工厂，绝大部分都有新式的机器设备，全部生产过程都是机械化与半机械化的。包头砖瓦厂就是其中的一个。这是一个近代化的、规模相当大的砖瓦制造厂，它拥有六十门轮窑和一百五十座马蹄窑，以及大型制砖机和中型制砖机等机械化设备。按人工制砖每人每天最多只能制五百块；但一部中型制砖机每小时即可制砖坯五千块。包头采石厂也是一个使用先进机械设备的工厂，有立式、卧式的空气压缩机、风钻、碎石机、电焊机等，此外，还有轻便铁轨、小火车头、矿车等机械化运输工具。即将兴建的包头木材木器厂，拥有各种带锯、断锯、压锯、压刨、四面刨、配电室、干燥间、油漆包布车间、木丝板车间和木丝运输机。此外，包头市今年新建与扩建的，还有小五金制造厂、氧气厂、汽车修配厂、水泥管道厂、耐火器材制造厂等。
    在包头和平地泉，今年将各修建一座新式的火力发电厂；归绥市发电厂也将在原有设备的基础上再扩建一部两千瓩的透平式发电机；在锡林郭勒盟锡林浩特（贝子庙），今年将要建筑一座小型火力发电厂，为将来锡林浩特各厂矿服务。在伊克昭盟境内计划修建一座规模较大的火碱厂，今年先着手进行地质勘探工作。上述这两个工厂投入生产后，将给附近的牧民带来经济上的繁荣。在海拉尔市今年将出现一座机械化的冻肉厂；在扎兰屯除了扩建原有的农具工厂，增加农业生产工具供应外，还将修建一座面积达四万平方公尺的面粉厂。上述这些工程，大部分计划在今年五月前后进行施工。
    内蒙古的城市建设规模也在扩大。归绥市今年将出现不少高层建筑物，将兴建一座百货联合商场。内蒙古邮电管理局也将扩建一座二千五百平方公尺的办公大楼。在包头、海拉尔、平地泉也将出现一批新的建筑物。目前内蒙古建筑工程局所属设计公司正在为各城市设计大批经济、适用、美观耐久的建筑图样。包头、归绥、平地泉、海拉尔、满洲里、喜桂图旗、通辽等七个城市还将成立城市建设委员会，着手研究、规划今后城市的发展计划。
