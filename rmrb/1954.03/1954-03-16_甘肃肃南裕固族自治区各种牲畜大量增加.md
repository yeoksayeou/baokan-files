    Gansu Province, Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region, has seen a significant increase in various livestock, with over 136,000 sheep. In 1950, the entire region had just over 63,000 sheep. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups have sold large quantities of wool, camel hair, and various animal hides to the state to support industrial construction. The Hongwansi Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone purchased over 30% more wool last year than in 1952. After the formal establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government in February of this year, the production enthusiasm of herdsmen of all ethnic groups is even higher. The entire region has set a breeding plan for various livestock for 1954, with sheep to increase by 24% compared to 1953, horses by 10%, cattle by 12%, donkeys by 8%, and camels by 4%. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups are also actively requesting to breed Blue Halha sheep with native sheep to improve the breed and increase wool production and quality. Currently, more than 80 wolf-hunting teams of herdsmen across the region have ridden their fine horses into the snowy Qilian Mountains to actively engage in hunting activities.

    甘肃肃南裕固族自治区各种牲畜大量增加
    甘肃省肃南裕固族自治区各种牲畜大量发展，已有羊只十三万六千多只。而一九五零年全区共有六万三千多只羊。各族牧民已把大批羊毛、驼毛和各种畜皮卖给国家，来支援工业建设。仅红湾寺供销合作社在去年收购的羊毛就比一九五二年增加了百分之三十以上。今年二月自治区人民政府正式成立后，各族牧民的生产情绪更高。全区订出了一九五四年各种牲畜的增殖计划，羊只要比一九五三年增殖百分之二十四，马匹增殖百分之十，牛增殖百分之十二，驴增殖百分之八，骆驼增殖百分之四。各族牧民还积极要求用蓝哈羊和土种绵羊配种，改良品种，提高羊毛的产量和质量。现在，全区八十多个打狼小组的牧民，已骑着骏马进入白雪皑皑的祁连山，积极展开狩猎活动。　（新华社）
