    Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative Launches Spring Plowing Competition
    The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has launched a spring plowing competition. The cooperative has now prepared more than 60 loads of fertilizer for each mu of cultivated land. The seeds needed for spring sowing have also been fully prepared, and more than 220 pieces of large and small agricultural tools such as plows, shares, clod crushers, and sieves have been added and repaired. Under the influence and help of the cooperative, the seven mutual aid groups in the township, in addition to accumulating many compost heaps, have also smoked more than 1,000 loads of cave fertilizer, and 80 percent of the farmers have prepared enough fuel for eight or nine months.
    The spring plowing production competition launched by the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative this year has three characteristics: First, the active leadership of the Communist Party organization and the exemplary role of Party members. In the production process, the Communist Party branch in Xigou Township instructed Party members distributed in various production teams to take the lead in the labor competition. The production team led by Communist Party members Ma Yuxing and Zhang Xincai took the lead in smoking 350 loads of cave fertilizer, and other production teams then launched a cave fertilizer campaign. In just over a month, the cooperative smoked a total of 16,000 loads of cave fertilizer. Second, the specific leadership of the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee consists of 13 people, each specifically responsible for a production team, and regularly responsible for checking and督促 the implementation of the production plan of each team, so that the competition can be carried out better. Third, timely inspection, commendation of advanced units, and promotion of advanced experience. Therefore, all 16 production teams in the cooperative completed the fertilizer delivery work ten days ahead of schedule. The township saved 220 man-days in the fertilizer delivery alone.

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社开展春耕竞赛
    山西省平顺县西沟乡李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社已经开展春耕竞赛。全社现在已为每亩耕地准备好肥料六十多担。春耕播种需用的种籽也已准备齐全，并增添和修理了犁、铧、耢、箩头等大小农具二百二十多件。全乡七个互助组在该社的影响和帮助下，除积存许多堆肥外，还熏洞肥一千多担，并有百分之八十的农户准备了够八九个月用的燃料。
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社今年开展的春耕生产竞赛有三个特点：一是共产党组织的积极领导和党员的模范作用。西沟乡的共产党支部在生产过程中，责成分布在各个生产小组的党员在劳动竞赛中起带头作用。共产党员马玉兴、张新才领导的生产小组首先带头熏洞肥三百五十担，其他生产小组随即也开展熏洞肥运动。一个多月内，全社共熏洞肥一万六千担。二是评比委员会的具体领导。评比委员会共十三人，都具体分工负责一个生产小组，经常负责检查督促各组生产计划执行的情况，使竞赛能更好地进行。三是及时检查，表扬先进单位，推广先进经验。因此全社十六个生产小组比原计划提前十天完成了送肥工作。全乡仅送肥一项即节省人工二百二十个。
