    Over a thousand outstanding women in Shanghai have been elected as district people's representatives in China's unprecedented democratic elections. The representatives represent a wide range of professions and social strata, including members of the CCP District Committee, district heads of the People's Government, factory directors, workshop directors, workers, train conductors, heads of agricultural production cooperatives, doctors, nurses, Young Pioneer instructors, teachers, students, families of revolutionary soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and housewives.

    Female workers account for slightly less than one-quarter of the representatives. The elected female people's representatives are all contributing their strength to the country's construction in various positions, and are therefore trusted and loved by the voters. Min Shufen, director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, inspired by the play "Dawn Shines on Moscow," organized discussions last year with employees and suburban farmers to solicit their opinions on the factory's printed cloth. At the time, a rural girl jokingly said, "The goldfish printed cloth I bought is very beautiful, but when I put it in the water to wash it, the goldfish swim away." Later, Min Shufen and the engineers came up with many ways to prevent the cloth from fading. Last year, this female factory director also supported and accepted nearly 1,400 rationalization proposals, increasing production and saving the country more than 3 billion yuan in wealth. Wu Cuiqin, a national model worker in the textile industry, is a skilled silk weaver at the state-owned Shanghai Silk Factory. Her production volume is consistently the highest in the factory, and she has not produced a single substandard piece in more than three years. She has received production bonuses eleven times in one year alone. Another people's representative, Chen Fenying, was an illiterate housewife three years ago, but is now a cultured and skilled outstanding train conductor. Li Xiaoqing, the deputy director of the First Department of the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation Nursery, is only in her twenties but has been working in childcare for nearly ten years and has achieved excellent results. Xu Tingting, an outstanding instructor who attended the Second National Conference on Children's Work, was also elected as a people's representative this time. To enrich her teaching content, she has visited many factories and interviewed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Many housewives were also elected as people's representatives. They are all active participants in various social activities. Wang Shulan, a people's representative from the North Sichuan Road District, often took the lead in cleaning the dirtiest places during last year's patriotic health campaign. When dredging the Yokohama River, she was the first to jump down and scoop up mud, motivating others to work. Once, she accompanied a woman who had a miscarriage to the hospital. Because the patient was bleeding non-stop, Wang Shulan donated her own blood to the patient, resolving the patient's danger. Tang Guifen, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, Jiang Zhaoju, president of the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital of the Chinese Welfare Institute, and Yi Shijuan, a national model worker in the textile industry, were also elected as people's representatives. They all expressed their determination to be loyal to the people and to their duties. Yi Shijuan led her group to complete the production plans for January and February and is now continuing to work hard to complete the production plan for March.

    上海市有一千多名妇女当选为区人民代表
    上海市有一千多名优秀妇女在我国史无前例的民主选举中当选为区人民代表。代表们代表着广泛的职业和阶层，其中有中共区委委员、人民政府的区长、工厂厂长、车间主任、工人、列车车长、农业生产合作社社长、医师、护士、少年先锋队辅导员、教师、学生、革命军人家属、革命烈士家属和家庭妇女等。
    代表中女工的数目占四分之一弱。当选的女人民代表们都在各个不同的岗位上为国家的建设事业贡献着自己的力量，因而受到选民们的信赖和热爱。国营上海第一印染厂厂长闵淑芬受了话剧“曙光照耀着莫斯科”的启示，去年曾组织职工和郊区农民座谈，征询农民们对工厂生产的花布的意见。当时有一位农村姑娘诙谐地说：“我买的金鱼花布很漂亮，可惜放到水里一洗，金鱼就溜到水里去了。”后来，闵淑芬和工程师们想了许多办法使这种花布不再褪色。去年，这位女厂长还支持和接受了近一千四百件合理化建议，为国家增产节约了三十多亿元人民币的财富。全国纺织工业劳动模范吴翠琴是国营上海丝绸厂的织绸能手。她的生产量经常是全厂最高，而且三年多不曾出过一匹次货。曾在一年内就获得了十一次生产奖金。另一位人民代表陈芬英在三年前还是一个目不识丁的家庭妇女，现在已经是一个有文化、有技术的优秀的列车车长。只有二十多岁的上海市民主妇女联合会保育院第一部副主任李小卿已经做了近十年保育工作，而且作出了很好的成绩。曾出席第二次全国少年儿童工作会议的优秀辅导员许婷婷这次也当选为人民代表。她为了丰富教课的内容，曾参观不少工厂和访问了解放军战士。当选的人民代表中还有许多家庭妇女。她们都是各种社会活动的积极参加者。北四川路区人民代表王淑兰在去年的爱国卫生运动中经常带头打扫最肮脏的场所，在疏浚横滨河时曾第一个跳下去捞泥，带动别人工作。有一次她陪着一个小产的病妇上医院，由于病人流血不止，王淑兰曾将自己的血输给病人，解除了病人的危险。当选为人民代表的，还有中国纺织工会上海市委员会主席汤桂芬、中国福利会国际和平保健院院长江兆菊、全国纺织工业劳动模范裔式娟等。她们都表示了自己忠于人民、忠于职责的决心。裔式娟领导着她的小组完成了一、二月份的生产计划，现在正继续为完成三月份的生产计划而努力。
