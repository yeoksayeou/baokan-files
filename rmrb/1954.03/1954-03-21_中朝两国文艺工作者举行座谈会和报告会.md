    Some members of the North Korean People's Delegation to China held a literary and art symposium with people from the capital's literary and art circles on the afternoon of the 20th. Chinese literary and art figures introduced the development of China's literary and art work. The symposium was presided over by Mao Dun and Zhou Yang, vice chairmen of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

    Literary and art figures among the delegation representatives, including Kim Buk-won, Hwang Kun, Kil Jin-seop, Lee Seo-hyang, Lim Su-hyang, Moon Hak-joon, and Lee Jeong-eon, as well as some members of various art troupes, participated in the symposium.

    More than 60 well-known figures from China's literary, drama, film, music, fine arts, dance, and folk art circles also participated in the symposium, including Yang Hansheng, Xiao San, Liu Baiyu, Zhou Libo, Feng Xuefeng, Xie Bingxin, Ye Shengtao, Ai Qing, Wei Wei, Hong Shen, Cao Yu, Cai Chusheng, Shi Dongshan, Guang Weiran, Ma Yanxiang, Chen Qitong, Wu Xue, Shi Lianxing, Yu Lan, Lü Ji, Shi Lemeng, Qu Xixian, Jiang Feng, Liu Kaiqu, Cai Ruohong, Gu Yuan, Xu Yansun, Zhou Weizhi, Dai Ailian, Wu Xiaobang, Zhang Yunxi, and Wang Yaping.

    The symposium began with a speech by Mao Dun. He said: China and North Korea are brotherly countries, as close as lips and teeth, and have had an exceptionally deep friendship since ancient times. We have an extremely close relationship in culture and art. This relationship has become more consolidated and closer in the great struggle to jointly resist the American imperialist aggressors and defend peace. Under the care and guidance of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, North Korean literary and art workers have achieved exceptionally brilliant development, providing us with valuable examples. We must sincerely learn from our comrades in the North Korean literary and art circles.

    Zhou Yang spoke at the meeting, expressing a warm welcome to the representatives of the heroic North Korean people and the outstanding North Korean literary artists. He said: North Korean literary and art workers stand in the ranks advancing together with all the North Korean people, and have made tremendous achievements in resisting the aggression of American imperialism, defending North Korea's independence and freedom, and defending Asian and world peace. From the North Korean literary, artistic, and film works that have been translated into Chinese, especially from the wonderful performances of this delegation's art troupe, the achievements of North Korean literature and art have given us an extremely deep impression. Zhou Yang said: Chinese and North Korean literary and art workers have a common task, which is to use literary and artistic works to depict the unprecedented heroic deeds of the people of both countries jointly defeating the American aggressors. Such works will be the most powerful weapons to inspire and educate the people of both countries and promote the cause of world peace.

    Kim Buk-won, representative of the delegation, Chairman of the Children's Literature Branch of the Korean Writers' Union, and writer, spoke. He said that he was very happy to be able to gather with people from the Chinese literary and art circles today. He said: In our country's struggle for liberation, the brotherly Chinese people not only dispatched the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers to fight alongside us against the American imperialist aggressors, but also dispatched well-known writers and artists to participate in the struggle. The many excellent works they created greatly inspired our people's struggle and further strengthened the cultural exchange between the Chinese and North Korean peoples.

    Subsequently, the meeting was divided into five groups—literature, drama and film, music, fine arts, and dance—for discussions. Chinese literary and art figures introduced the development and achievements of China's work in literature, drama and film, music, fine arts, and dance over the past few years.

    On the evening of the 20th, the capital's literary and art workers held a welcome meeting under the auspices of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. More than 1,300 people attended the report meeting, where Kim Buk-won, representative of the North Korean People's Delegation to China, Chairman of the Children's Literature Branch of the Korean Writers' Union, and writer, gave a report to the literary and art circles on the development of North Korean literature and art. He described the leap-forward development of literature and art in North Korea after liberation, under the guidance and care of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and listed many excellent works by North Korean writers in novels, poems, and scripts that used noble patriotism as their theme. He then talked about the efforts made by writers in the difficult environment during the war against American imperialism to create more new works. The heroic struggle of the North Korean people and the Korean People's Army during the war enriched the themes of literature and art. Finally, he talked about the situation of translating Chinese literary and artistic works in North Korea and expressed the hope that cultural exchanges between North Korea and China could be further developed in the future. At the report meeting, the North Korean representative Kim Buk-won presented banners and gifts to China's literary and art circles, and China's literary and art circles also presented banners to the North Korean representative.
