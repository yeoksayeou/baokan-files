    Economic Construction in People's Democratic Countries
    Korea Mobilizes Architects for Reconstruction Work
    The Korean National Conference of Architects and Construction Technicians was held in Pyongyang from the 25th to the 27th. The conference discussed the tasks of architects and construction technicians in the recovery and development of the post-war people's economy.
    Korean people's leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and party and government leaders Kim Tu-bong, Hong Myong-hui, Kim Seung-hwa, and Kim Doo-sam attended the conference. Participants included representatives of technicians and technical personnel from construction departments across the country, as well as administrative staff.
    Marshal Kim Il-sung gave instructions at the meeting. He said: All architects and construction technicians must seriously stand on the position of seeking welfare for the people and create modern architectural art with national forms. We must strive for the standardization of design, the industrialization of material production, and the mechanization of construction. New and old technical personnel should learn advanced technologies and experiences from each other. We must strengthen discipline and order in the construction sector.
    Attendees engaged in enthusiastic discussions on the above instructions and reports, unanimously expressing their determination to promote high creativity and initiative and make new achievements in their work.
    The conference finally adopted a letter of appeal, calling on all workers, technicians, staff, and engineers in the construction sector to actively carry out post-war reconstruction work.
  Korean Factories Accelerate the Manufacture of Farm Tools and Fishing Boats
    Some factories and enterprises under the Mechanical Industry Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have partially resumed production and are stepping up the manufacture of a large number of new farm tools and fishing boats to meet the production needs of agriculture and the fishing industry.
    The larger machinery factories, such as the Bukjung Machinery Factory, the Rakwon Machinery Factory, the Heecheon Machinery Factory, and many iron factories and farm tool factories, have partially resumed production and have produced many mechanical parts and a large number of farm tools for many factories, mines, and the vast rural areas. The output of farm tools this year can be increased by more than eight times compared with 1953. Local shipbuilding industries had manufactured thirteen fishing boats by the end of February. The larger shipbuilding yards in Korea, such as the Nampo Shipyard and the Chongjin Shipyard, can manufacture seventy 50-ton wooden boats this year. The Wonsan Shipyard and other units, which were severely damaged, are stepping up their recovery efforts and will soon be able to resume production.
    According to the provisions of the People's Economic Recovery and Development Plan, the machinery industry is the government's largest investment target. The output value of the machinery industry this year will reach 80% of the pre-war level.
  Czech Tractor Stations Increase Shifts to Assist Spring Planting
    Spring has arrived in the fields of Czechoslovakia, and laboring farmers are actively engaged in spring field work. Many state-owned farms and unified agricultural cooperatives across the country have completed their spring sowing plans ahead of schedule. The Krchleby Unified Agricultural Cooperative was the first cooperative in the central Pardubice region to complete spring sowing. The cooperative members adopted the Soviet advanced close-planting method and have completed the sowing of all spring grains, and have also applied additional fertilizers to crops sown last winter and carried out appropriate cultivation. In order to fully utilize the effectiveness of existing machinery and to help farmers with spring plowing in a timely manner, machine tractor stations in various places have increased work shifts when necessary. Tractor drivers from the Ustí, Gottwaldov, and Hradec Králové regions, as well as agricultural machinery repair workers and members of unified agricultural cooperatives who can drive tractors, have enthusiastically participated in this extra labor. Workers at machine tractor stations use the Soviet advanced close-planting method as much as possible when sowing grains. Grains sown using this method can increase production by four to five hundred kilograms per hectare.
  Romanian Workers Support Farmers in Spring Planting
    Spring sowing is proceeding intensively in various regions of Romania, and significant progress has been made in many areas. The characteristic of Romania's spring fieldwork this year is that workers across the country are responding to the call of the Workers' Party and the government to vigorously support farmers in accelerating the completion of spring plowing in order to develop agricultural production. At mass meetings held in various industrial and mining enterprises, hundreds of workers, technicians, and engineers requested to work at machine tractor stations and state-owned farms in order to make the best use of agricultural machinery and tractors. Agricultural machinery manufacturing plants in various places have manufactured a large amount of machinery for agriculture. Since the beginning of this year, the Soviet Tractor Factory in Stalin City alone has shipped about five hundred tractors. In addition, machine tractor stations in various places have recently received many tractors and other highly efficient agricultural machines shipped from the Soviet Union.
    Socialist Competition Unfolds in Polish Rural Areas
    Spring fieldwork is proceeding in full swing in Poland. Socialist competition to complete spring sowing ahead of schedule has been launched in rural areas across the country. Many agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, and individual farmers in the southern and southwestern regions have completed the sowing of grains. In order to realize the call of the United Workers' Party on further developing agriculture, the Central Administration Bureau of State Machine Tractor Stations recently established ninety new district machine rental stations and more than one hundred permanent machine rental stations directly in rural areas. The number of agricultural machines working in the fields this year has increased compared to last year. During this year's spring plowing, workers from various industrial enterprises in Poland also formed hundreds of liaison teams to go to the countryside to help laboring farmers prepare for spring fieldwork, publicize agricultural knowledge, inspect and repair agricultural machinery, help rural party organizations carry out political education work, and help social organizations and youth organizations prepare for cultural and recreational activities in rural areas.
    Bulgaria Decreases Prices for the Fourth Time
    The Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party have adopted a decision to implement the fourth unified retail price reduction for consumer goods nationwide starting from March 29th. The scope of consumer goods price reductions is quite extensive, including various textiles, shoes, phonographs, clocks and watches, thermos bottles, motorcycles, fruits, bread, flour, meat, etc. Among these consumer goods, southern fruits will be reduced by 48%, textiles by 20% to 40%, wool textiles by 15% to 30%, silk textiles by 10% to 25%, and motorcycles by 25%. The decision points out that this price reduction, implemented on the basis of new achievements in the national economy, will benefit the people of the whole country by more than 970 million leva (Bulgarian currency) in one year.
