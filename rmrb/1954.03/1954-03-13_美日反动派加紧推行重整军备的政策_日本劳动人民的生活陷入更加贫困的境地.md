Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The lives of the Japanese people, constantly undermined by the rearmament policy, will become even more impoverished with the signing and implementation of the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement."

According to the Japanese "Industry and Labor Monthly Report" of January, in the year 1953, the cost of living index rose by 26.7 percent; at the same time, the real wage index fell by 4.3 percent. Under these circumstances, many workers are living beyond their means. For example, among workers in private railways, 60 percent do not earn enough to make a living. Among workers at the Amagasaki Factory of Kobe Steel Works, 69.1 percent have to borrow money to survive. At present, the prices of necessities continue to rise, especially those monopolized by the Yoshida government. The "Industry and Labor Monthly Report" stated that in January, the price of rationed rice rose by 12 percent. Public utilities and monopoly goods, such as electricity, postage, and cigarettes, are prepared to increase prices by 10 to 20 percent in April, which will further reduce the living standards of the Japanese people.

With the intensification of rearmament, the tax burden on the Japanese people will also become heavier. The Japanese bourgeois magazine "Economic Trends" once estimated that according to the Yoshida government's plan to accept US "Mutual Security Act Aid" for rearmament, the actual military expenditure on the Japanese side will reach 390 billion yen by the fifth year. This will increase the proportion of tax revenue in the national income from the current 21.6 percent to 29.5 percent (13.8 percent before the war, from 1934 to 1936), and the people's living standards will decline by 15.8 percent. Even according to the "Household Survey" of the Statistics Bureau of the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, after deducting taxes, the average income of each household of urban working people nationwide last year was only 17,852 yen, while the average minimum living cost per household in Japan is at least 20,000 yen per month.

The policy of intensifying rearmament is also driving a large number of Japanese working people into the desperate situation of unemployment. The Yoshida government has decided to lay off 68,000 civil servants this year to use the "saved" administrative expenses to increase military spending. The fiscal austerity policy implemented by the Yoshida government to ensure rearmament is causing many small and medium-sized enterprises to close down, resulting in mass unemployment for workers. Kyodo News Agency said that if this austerity policy continues to intensify, "it may cause a large-scale bankruptcy panic."

### 美日反动派加紧推行重整军备的政策  日本劳动人民的生活陷入更加贫困的境地

    美日反动派加紧推行重整军备的政策
    日本劳动人民的生活陷入更加贫困的境地
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：不断遭到重整军备政策破坏的日本人民的生活，将随着美日“共同防御援助协定”的签订和实施而更加贫困。
    据一月号日本“产业劳动月报”报道，在一九五三年一年中，生活费指数上涨了百分之二十六点七；同时，实际工资指数下降了百分之四点三。在这种情况下，许多工人都过着入不敷出的生活。例如在私营铁路的工人中，百分之六十收入不够维持生活。神户制钢所尼崎工厂的工人，有百分之六十九点一要借债度日。目前，生活必需品的价格仍在继续上涨，特别是为吉田政府所垄断的东西。“产业劳动月报”说：在一月份中，配给米价上涨了百分之十二。公用事业和专卖品，如电费、邮费和纸烟，准备到四月份时加价百分之十到二十，这就要使日本人民的生活水平进一步降低。
    随着重整军备的加紧进行，日本人民的捐税负担也将更为沉重。日本资产阶级杂志“经济往来”曾估计：按照吉田政府接受美国“共同安全法援助”进行重整军备的计划，到第五年，日本方面的实际军费支出将达三千九百亿日元。这将使税收在国民收入的比重中从目前的百分之二十一点六增到百分之二十九点五（战前一九三四年到一九三六年为百分之十三点八），人民生活水平将下降百分之十五点八。即使根据日本总理府统计局的“家计调查”，去年全国都市劳动人民每户平均收入在扣去税金后，只剩下一万七千八百五十二日元，而日本每户最低的生活费用每月平均至少在二万日元以上。
    加紧重整军备的政策还在把大量日本劳动人民驱入失业的绝境。吉田政府已经决定在今年内裁减六万八千名公务人员，用“节省”下来的行政费用去增加军费。吉田政府为保证重整军备而实施的财政紧缩政策，正在使许多中小企业倒闭，大批工人失业。共同社说：这种紧缩政策加紧进行下去，
  “可能引起大规模的倒闭恐慌”。
