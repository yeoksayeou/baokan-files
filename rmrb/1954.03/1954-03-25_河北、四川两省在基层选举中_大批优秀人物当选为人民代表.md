    Large Numbers of Outstanding Individuals Elected as People's Representatives in Basic-Level Elections in Hebei and Sichuan Provinces

    According to Xinhua News Agency: In the general election, large numbers of outstanding individuals in Hebei and Sichuan provinces were elected as people's representatives.

    In Hebei Province, out of 11,500 basic-level electoral units, 2,329 have completed elections. In the basic-level elections, outstanding Communist Party members and model workers have received the trust and support of the vast majority of voters. According to materials from areas where general elections have been completed, more than half of the elected representatives are outstanding Communist Party members. In urban and industrial/mining areas, more than 40% are advanced workers and model laborers, and in rural areas, more than 80% are the backbone of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Voters affectionately call these outstanding individuals "pathfinders of socialism." Han Guihua, a nationally renowned textile industry model worker and young female Communist Party member, was honorably elected as a people's representative. In the 1953 production increase and frugality campaign, she set a new national record by overseeing 1,400 spindles. After her advanced experience was promoted throughout the factory, the average number of spindles overseen per person increased from 437 to 713. Among those elected as people's representatives are also Ma Wanshui, a renowned model worker from the Longyan Iron Mine, and Zhao Naibin, a model engineer from Tangshan Steel Plant. They have created tremendous wealth for the country through their production efforts. Zhao Naibin's expansion of the furnace hearth alone increased the country's wealth by 44.3 billion yuan in one year. Jie Tie, father of Jie Xiumei, a female hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Geng Changsuo, who established one of the earliest agricultural production cooperatives in the country, and provincial-level model workers Liang Jiarui and Hu Mingyuan, were also elected as district and township people's representatives with extremely high votes.

    According to statistics from more than 100 counties, including Hejiang and Luxian, in Sichuan Province, out of over 80,000 people's representatives in over 2,300 basic-level units, more than 33,000 are outstanding Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. Voters affectionately call them "locomotives of socialism." Many advanced figures in the mutual aid and cooperation movement have also received the support of voters. According to statistics, among the people's representatives in 35 basic-level units in counties such as Neijiang, more than 220 serve as chairpersons of agricultural production cooperatives and leaders of mutual aid teams. Among the people's representatives elected in various regions are also family members of heroes and other outstanding figures from various fields. Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, a Special Class Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Li Youlian, the mother of Lu Yujiu, a Merit Citation Class II recipient and model in cherishing the people from the Volunteers, and Guo Lan'ying, the wife of Gao Lianglun, a Hero Class II recipient and Special Merit Citation recipient from the Volunteers, were all elected as people's representatives. Li Anfei, a 19-year-old primary school graduate from Fengle Township, Qu County, who actively participated in agricultural production, and other model figures were also elected as people's representatives.

    After the outstanding individuals supported by the people are elected as people's representatives, the connection between the basic-level government and the people becomes even closer. After being elected as a people's representative, Li Youlian, the mother of Lu Yujiu, a Merit Citation Class II recipient and model in cherishing the people from the Volunteers, immediately led the peasants in the entire village to repair a pond that could irrigate dozens of mu of farmland in three days, and led her mutual aid team and nearby mutual aid teams to implement joint mutual assistance, preparing to gradually build an agricultural production cooperative. At the township and town people's congresses held in various parts of Sichuan Province, people's representatives, according to the wishes of the voters, made resolutions to continue implementing and publicizing the general line and carry out patriotic production increase campaigns, which were supported by the broad masses of the people. At the People's Congress in Yong'an Township, Jiangyou County, a decision was made to rush the repair of the Nü'er Weir, which could irrigate more than 10,000 mu of farmland. After the meeting, the members of the township production construction committee and the people's representatives immediately mobilized the masses separately, and the weir was repaired in three days. In order to implement the resolutions of the township and town people's congresses, farmers in 14 townships and towns in Qingshen County have already accumulated more than 42 million jin of fertilizer and repaired more than 310 small-scale water conservancy projects such as ponds and weirs.

    河北、四川两省在基层选举中
    大批优秀人物当选为人民代表
    据新华社讯：河北、四川两省大批优秀人物在普选中当选为人民代表。
    河北省一万一千五百个基层选举单位中，已有两千三百二十九个基层单位完成选举。在基层选举中，优秀的共产党员和劳动模范受到最大多数选民的信任和拥护。根据已完成普选地区的材料看，当选的代表中有一半以上是优秀的共产党员，在城市和工矿区百分之四十以上是先进的工人和劳动模范，在农村百分之八十以上是农业生产合作社和互助组的骨干分子。选民们都亲热地称呼这些优秀人物为“社会主义的带路人”。光荣当选为人民代表的有全国著名的纺织工业劳动模范、青年女共产党员韩桂花。她在一九五三年的增产节约运动中，创造了看一千四百锭的全国新纪录。她的先进经验在全厂推广后，每人平均由看四百三十七锭提高到七百一十三锭。当选的人民代表中，还有龙烟铁矿著名的劳动模范马万水、唐山钢厂模范工程师赵乃斌等。他们在生产上都给国家创造了巨大的财富，只赵乃斌扩大炉膛一项，一年就给国家增产四百四十三亿元的财富。著名的中国人民志愿军女功臣解秀梅的父亲解铁，全国最早创办的农业生产合作社的耿长锁，省级劳动模范梁家瑞、胡明远等，也都以极高的选票当选为区、乡人民代表。
    四川省据合江、泸县等一百多县二千三百多个基层单位统计，八万多名人民代表中，优秀的共产党员和青年团员有三万三千多人。选民们亲切地称呼他们为“社会主义的火车头”。许多互助合作运动中的先进人物同样得到选民的拥护。据统计，在内江等县三十五个基层单位的人民代表中，担任农业生产合作社社长和互助组组长的有二百二十多人。各地选出的人民代表中，还有许多英雄人物的家属和其他各方面的优秀人物。中国人民志愿军特级英雄黄继光的母亲邓芳芝，志愿军特等功臣、二级爱民模范吕玉久的母亲李友莲，志愿军二级英雄、特等功臣高良伦的爱人郭兰英等，都被选为人民代表。当选为人民代表的，还有渠县丰乐乡积极参加农业生产的十九岁的小学毕业生李安飞等模范人物。
    人民群众所拥护的优秀人物被选为人民代表以后，使基层政权和人民群众的联系更加密切。志愿军特等功臣、二级爱民模范吕玉久的母亲李友莲在当选为人民代表后，立即带动全村农民在三天内修好一口能灌溉数十亩田地的塘堰，并领导她的互助组和附近互助组实行联组互助，准备逐步建成农业生产合作社。在四川省各地召开的乡、镇人民代表大会上，人民代表们根据选民的意愿，作出继续贯彻宣传总路线、开展爱国增产运动等决议，得到广大人民的拥护。江油县永安乡在人民代表大会上，决定了抢修可灌溉一万多亩田地的女儿堰，会后，该乡生产建设委员会的委员和人民代表立刻分别发动群众，三天时间便把这条堰修好了。青神县十四个乡、镇的农民，为执行乡、镇人民代表大会的决议，已积肥四千二百多万斤，修了塘、堰等小型水利工程三百一十多处。
