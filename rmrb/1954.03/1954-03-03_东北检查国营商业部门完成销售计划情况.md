Northeast Investigates the Completion of Sales Plans by State-Owned Commercial Departments
    According to a recent investigation by the Commercial Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the completion of planned targets by state-owned commercial departments in the region during January and early February was not satisfactory, with certain systems and areas failing to meet their predetermined goals.

    From January 1st to February 10th, the entire region only completed 40.6% of the quarterly sales plan. In terms of regions, the best performance in completing the plan was seen in: Fushun City, completing 49.2% of the quarterly plan; Liaoxi Province, completing 48.1%; and Rehe Province, completing 47.8%. The worst performance in completing the plan was seen in: Liaodong Province, completing only 38.1%; and Harbin City, completing only 23.5%. From the perspective of specialized systems, the best performance in completing the plan was seen in the native produce system, completing 49.8% of the quarterly plan; the chemical industry system, completing 50%; the department store system performed worse, completing only 40.5%.

    The main reasons why some systems and units have performed well in completing their plans are: First, workers were mobilized to earnestly study and discuss the Party's general line for the transition period. The broad masses of workers enhanced their political awareness and enthusiasm, clearly recognizing the economic and political significance of completing and exceeding the planned targets. For example, after the workers of the hardware store of the Shenyang Hardware and Machinery Company studied the general line, they actively contacted factories and mines, expanded sales through the signing of supply contracts, and exceeded the January state plan by 5%. Second, the leadership paid close attention and arranged work early, preventing complacency in advance. For example, units in Dalian and Shenyang that performed well in completing their plans seized the time at the beginning of the year to mobilize workers to discuss the plan and launched labor competitions in conjunction, ensuring the reliable completion of state plans. In early January, Liaoxi Province organized department stores in various cities and counties to hold industrial product exhibitions in rural areas, closely integrated with cooperatives, and expanded sales. Therefore, the province has become the best-performing region in the department store system in the entire region. Third, importance was attached to the inspection of plan implementation. The Shenyang Joint Company used small groups to conduct five-minute work inspections before work every day, checking the completion of the previous day's plan to correct and improve at any time, which played a certain role in expanding sales and completing the plan.

    The reasons for the poor completion of planned targets in some regions and units are that some units have a relaxed mentality, and leading cadres are only busy with summarizing and evaluating models, neglecting the timely supervision and inspection of the completion of planned targets. Some units have negative waiting mentality, waiting for deployment, waiting for plans, and waiting for the peak season, so they did not seize the time to mobilize workers to discuss the state plan in-depth and comprehensively, and earnestly carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. In addition, some units do not conduct a specific analysis of inventory and organize procurement according to the severity and urgency of the situation, resulting in some commodities being out of stock in the market.

    Based on the current plan completion situation, the leadership organs at all district and professional system levels, as well as the provincial and municipal levels, should conduct key in-depth inspections. The Northeast Commercial Bureau will also organize cadres to go down to inspect the work, so as to help all units discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and take effective measures to ensure the completion of the quarterly plan.

    东北检查国营商业部门完成销售计划情况
    根据东北行政委员会商业局最近的检查，一月份和二月上旬全区国营商业部门完成计划的情况不好，某些系统和地区没有完成预定计划。
    从一月一日至二月十日，全区只完成一季度销售计划的百分之四十点六。从地区来看，完成计划较好的有：抚顺市完成季度计划百分之四十九点二，辽西省完成百分之四十八点一，热河省完成百分之四十七点八。计划完成得差的是：辽东省仅完成百分之三十八点一，哈尔滨市仅完成百分之二十三点五。从专业系统来看，计划完成情况较好的为土产系统，完成季度计划百分之四十九点八，化工系统完成百分之五十，百货系统完成得较差，仅完成百分之四十点五。
    有些系统和单位计划完成好的主要原因有以下几点：第一，发动职工认真学习和讨论了国家过渡时期总路线，广大职工提高了政治觉悟和积极性，明确认识到完成计划和超额完成计划在经济上政治上的重要意义。如沈阳市五金机械公司五金商店职工学习总路线后，积极联系厂矿，通过签订供应合同，扩大推销，已超额百分之五完成了一月份国家计划。第二，领导抓的紧，工作布置得早，预先防止了产生松劲思想。如旅大市和沈阳市完成计划较好的单位，在年初都抓紧时间发动职工讨论计划，并结合开展劳动竞赛，使完成国家计划有了可靠保证。辽西省在一月初组织各市县百货公司普遍深入农村举办工业品展览会，密切与合作社结合，扩大了推销，因此，该省已成为全区百货系统完成计划最好的一个地区。第三，重视计划执行情况的检查。沈阳市联营公司以小组为单位在每天上班前做五分钟工作检查，检查前一天计划完成情况，以便随时纠正改进，对扩大推销完成计划都起了一定作用。
    部分地区和单位计划完成不好的原因，是由于有些单位存在松劲思想，领导干部只忙于总结、评模，放松了对完成计划的及时督促检查；有些单位存在着等部署、等计划、等旺季的消极等待思想，因而没有抓紧时间，发动职工深入地全面地讨论国家计划，并认真开展增产节约竞赛。另外，还有的单位对库存情况不作具体分析，分别轻重缓急组织进货，以致某些商品在市场脱销。
    根据目前计划完成情况，各区级各专业系统及省市领导机关，应有重点地深入检查；东北商业局亦将组织干部下去检查工作，以便帮助各单位及时发现问题和解决问题，采取有效措施，保证一季度计划的完成。
