Striving to Create More and Better Mass Songs
    ——On Several Issues Concerning the Creation of Mass Songs
  　Lü Ji

    The national mass song awards, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles for the past three years, have been announced. This award can be said to be a more comprehensive review and summary of mass songs over the past three years. It affirms the achievements of mass song creation over the past three years, encourages all lyricists and composers, and enhances everyone's enthusiasm for creating various mass songs. More importantly, this award clarifies the direction of mass song development and enhances everyone's understanding of mass songs. With the announcement of the award results, the introduction and promotion of these winning songs to the masses in various regions will further develop and enrich the musical life of the masses. At the same time, it will also have a good effect on the future development and improvement of mass song art.

One, Songs Reflecting the New Era

    A total of 208 songs were submitted for judging by major administrative regions, the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, and art troupes directly under the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, of which 114 songs won awards. Although this number is small (according to incomplete statistics from the Chinese Musicians Association in 1953, about 10,000 mass songs have been produced in various regions since the founding of the People's Republic of China), they all reflect, to varying degrees, major events and significant changes in the spiritual life of the people in the new China. "People of the World Are of One Heart," "Ode to the Motherland," "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers," "Aunt Wang Wants Peace," "Singing of Mao Zedong," "I Am a Soldier," and "Singing of Mount Erlang" are among the most widely circulated songs among the masses in various regions. They not only truly reflect the social life of this period, but also clearly mark the enormous changes in the ideological sentiments of the broad masses during this period. What these songs express is the masses' desire for a peaceful life and their strong will to defend world peace, their love and praise for the motherland and the leader, their enthusiastic praise for the high patriotism and internationalism displayed by the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in countless heroic deeds, and their deep hatred for the US imperialists' insane and brutal war crimes. These new ideological sentiments are also reflected in many children's songs, with "Little Pigeon" being a relatively excellent example. These new ideological sentiments of the people have grown out of various mass movements and the fundamentally changed social life. Therefore, it can also be said that these new mass songs correctly reflect the enormous changes in the social life of this period.

    Many people may still remember that we once sang with grief and indignation songs like "Chinese Should Not Fight Chinese," "On the Songhua River," "The Singer Under the Iron Heel," "We Are Not Afraid to Bleed," "Teahouse Melody," and "You Bad Thing." The sad and indignant tunes reflecting those lives and struggles have become historical relics. The wheel of history has entered a new era and unfolded a brilliant new life. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have overthrown the semi-feudal and semi-colonial reactionary rule, driven out the imperialist forces, eliminated the feudal landlord class, and established a unified, independent, democratic, and increasingly prosperous and happy country. In the struggle against US aggression and aiding Korea, tens of thousands of heroes and advanced elements have emerged in various large-scale national defense and economic construction undertakings. They possess new ideological qualities of loving the motherland and the people, a high degree of labor enthusiasm and unlimited creativity, and hold grand ideals for life. They are full of confidence in the happiness of tomorrow, believe in the power of the collective, no longer believe in fate, believe that labor can create everything, and care for the interests of the collective far more than for themselves. All of this demonstrates the face of our new life.

    The correct ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party has enabled the various fraternal ethnic groups, who have long suffered under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, to live a democratic life with ethnic regional autonomy that has never been seen in history. Over the past three years, the folk singers of various fraternal ethnic groups have displayed their youthful and infinitely rich creativity. The people of various ethnic groups have produced many songs praising the new society and the new life. The most widely circulated songs are those praising Chairman Mao. These hymns are actually the most concentrated expression of praise for the new life, and therefore are particularly filled with joyful, sincere, and affectionate feelings of respect. "Singing of Mao Zedong" and "The Sun Rises on the Grassland" are two relatively excellent representatives in this regard. In addition, there are of course many excellent songs praising the new life, such as "Salute to Beijing," "Singing of Ethnic Regional Autonomy," and "Weaving Song." These songs should be said to be a particularly noteworthy part of the mass songs produced over the past three years. These songs have not only become the most beloved songs of the people of the ethnic groups that produced these works, but have also become a valuable spiritual wealth shared by all ethnic groups in our country.

    Among these more than one hundred winning songs, many come from the hands of familiar songwriters, but the names of a large number of songwriters are very unfamiliar to everyone. Most of these authors are very young, such as Comrades Abulim, Melik, Xu Ruilu, Yue Lun, and Liu Shouyi; some authors are not professional musicians. For example, Comrade Sun Zhenhua, the author of "For a Happy Tomorrow," and Comrade Yu Shaohua, the author of "We Are All Heroes of the New China," are both factory workers. The emergence of these new songwriters not only demonstrates that there is unlimited potential power hidden among young musicians and amateur music lovers of all ethnic groups, but also shows that these new forces are growing rapidly and continuously. We should express our greatest enthusiasm to them, welcome their emergence. Although their musical literacy may not be enough today, their works have already demonstrated that they have a high talent for creating tunes. In fact, their songs have brought us a strong and fresh breath, adding new brilliance to our song art. As long as they are not satisfied with this, continue to study hard, and with the enthusiastic care and help of everyone, their musical literacy can be gradually improved. These new and young songwriters undoubtedly have great potential for development, and their works are particularly worthy of our attention.

Two, Reflecting Life

    From these winning songs, it can be seen that the songwriters are making great efforts to praise the new life and the new struggles, striving to make their works truly reflect life and the ideological sentiments of the people. Some authors select larger political themes or more general subjects from real life to reflect the most common ideological sentiments in real life, such as those songs with the themes of praising the motherland, praising the leader, defending world peace, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, Sino-Soviet friendship, defending the border, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries; some authors capture a side of the main struggle life, or select some very ordinary things from daily life as subjects, but express the most profound ideological sentiments of the masses, and also achieve the goal of truly reflecting life, such as those songs with little pigeons, small red flags, glory lamps, bayonets, machine guns, grenades, cows, textiles, and sheep shearing as subjects.

    The reason why "People of the World Are of One Heart," "Ode to the Motherland," "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers," "Great Mao Zedong," "Aunt Wang Wants Peace," "Singing of Mount Erlang," "The Sun Rises on the Grassland," and "I Am a Soldier" are widely circulated among the masses across the country not only shows that the broad masses need such songs to express their ideological sentiments of loving peace, loving the motherland, loving the leader, and not fearing difficulties; the reason why "Xinjiang is Good," "Flowers Bloom on Both Sides of the Huai River," "Glory Lamp," "Weaving Song," "Little Pigeon," and many other songs are warmly welcomed by the masses not only shows that the masses are satisfied with these songs truly expressing their optimism in life, labor, and struggle, their ideals and hopes for life; more importantly, it profoundly illustrates that truly reflecting life does not require reflecting just any life, but first of all reflecting the new life and new struggles of the working people; not generally reflecting the new life and struggles, but requiring reflecting the most profound ideological sentiments of the masses in the new life and struggles, those advanced ideological sentiments that are still only budding today but are growing rapidly. Only in this way can mass songs have true social significance, can they improve and educate the people ideologically and emotionally, can they have the power to promote social progress, and can they fully play their role as weapons.

    Although some people, because they have seen that the songs created by some songwriters to serve a specific current political task have not achieved the due success, doubt whether mass songs should serve specific political tasks. It should be pointed out that mass songs, as a special weapon of struggle, cannot and should not be separated from the current real political struggles in which the broad masses participate. However, due to the author's lack of deep understanding of the current struggle tasks, or lack of deep experience in the lives of the masses, or lack of due performance skills, or simply lack of deep political enthusiasm, the works written lack real and vivid content. It can be said that correctly reflecting the emotions and demands of the masses in political struggles can encourage their enthusiasm for participating in political struggles and improve the enthusiasm of the masses for struggle, which will inevitably have a certain promoting effect on political struggles. Obviously, if mass songs do not have such songs, they will lose or weaken their position and role in the struggle life of the masses. Naturally, if it is believed that this is the only task of mass songs, and thus the broader needs of the masses' lives are ignored, that is also wrong. That would limit mass songs to a narrow scope and greatly reduce their social significance.

    If songwriters believe that songs expressing current political struggles can depart from the lives of the masses and can be created according to some written principles, instructions, and policy provisions, then they will inevitably create some conceptualized lyrics. If composers choose such lyrics, it will be difficult to write moving tunes. Even if someone composes a beautiful and emotional tune for it, it still cannot give the masses a deep feeling, and the masses will not like such songs. We have seen such a song whose first verse is like this:

        "The Soviet Union is a socialist country, we must study hard
    It, it has many methods for construction, industry and agriculture are developed
    Arrived; the working people are the masters, overcoming difficulties depends on everyone; it
    Various ethnic groups are united well, the people of the whole country are like a family; everyone
    Labor has great achievements, and happy flowers are blooming everywhere." Who would think this is a song lyric? This paragraph is enough for us to understand the extent to which this lyric is conceptualized. This is not an infectious lyric composed of poetic language rich in life images, and it cannot give the masses emotional infection. The author completely forgot these requirements. From the title, it can be seen that the author misunderstood mass songs. The title is "Learn from the Soviet Union to Build the Motherland." This misunderstanding clearly shows that the author does not understand that songs are to serve politics through artistic images and to play a role in propaganda and education for the people. There are quite a few people who have such misunderstandings. There are similar shortcomings in the lyrics of the winning songs, such as "Strive for Month-to-Month Full House Red," "Sino-Soviet People Are Closely United," and "New China Has Great Power."

    In addition, we also saw such a lyric:

            "War mongers get out, get out, get out,
    Get out of Korea, get out of Asia, get out of the world, get out of the world
    Go, get out! People who love peace are united
    Now, we will never let you be rampant again. Be sure to pierce your heart with thousands of steel knives.
    Your destiny is death."

    Needless to say, it is necessary to reflect and improve the Chinese people's hatred of American war mongers through mass songs, and the author's choice of this theme is correct. However, the author here neither wrote about the disasters and pain that American war mongers have brought to the Korean people, nor did he write anything about the lofty ideals of the Chinese and Korean people who love peace and oppose wars of aggression. Therefore, it is difficult to arouse the audience's hatred. In these eight lines, the word "get out" is used eight times. In the chorus, the word "get out" is repeated a total of thirty-six times by the various vocal parts before and after. Perhaps the author thought that the more "get out" is called, the more powerful the curse (in fact, it should not be just cursing), and the stronger the expression of the angry emotions against the war mongers. In fact, this did not express the anger of the masses. On the contrary, it exposed the author's poverty of life.

    Using such songs to serve the current specific political tasks will never have any effect. These comrades completely ignored that mass songs must rely on their special form of thinking and life images full of infection, and must achieve changes in ideological awareness through the emotional excitement of the audience, so as to play their role as weapons of propaganda and education. Songs are an art form that combines poetry and music. They require rich ideological content, but cannot replace the realistic poetic meaning brought by life images with concepts; they require beautiful and authentic musical images, aiming to inspire people's upward emotions, encourage people's loyalty to great ideals, and the spirit of moving forward bravely and fearlessly, becoming an active force in action; but not through it to make explanations of articles and tell some truths in a boring way.

Three, Lyrical Songs

    Although lyrical songs are not a new form of creation for us, everyone's understanding of lyrical songs is not completely consistent.

    Although the quantity and quality of lyrical songs created in the past three years cannot meet the objective needs, there has been new development and some new experiences have been provided.

    The first thing to talk about is the issue of themes and subjects of lyrical songs.

    In the past three years, everyone has not only created the very popular
  "Ode to the Motherland," "Singing of Mao Zedong," "The Sun Rises on the Grassland," "Singing of Mount Erlang," and "Aunt Wang Wants Peace," but also lyrical songs praising the life of the border people "Happy Xinjiang," praising socialist construction "Flowers Bloom on Both Sides of the Huai River," praising women's labor to support the War of Liberation "Weaving Song," praising military dependents "Glory Lamp," and praising the new Marriage Law "Tea Trees Blossom Round." Many lyrical songs have opened up a vast world. These songs are accomplished in recognizing life, expressing life, and especially in the creation of musical language, depicting the new spiritual qualities of the Chinese people as creators of a new life with bright colors.

    Judging from the themes and subjects, there are almost no restrictions. From praising the motherland and the leader to praising the life of the border people and praising the new Marriage Law, all subjects that are of positive significance in people's lives and beneficial to the people are included. This is obviously an important development, breaking the traditional understanding of lyrical songs. This is a very natural thing. In the old society, politics was dark and people were not allowed to ask questions. What else could people be willing and able to sing freely besides love, friendship, and nature? However, in the new society, especially in the three years after the national liberation, what people first want to sing is not love, friendship, and nature (although they are still subjects that everyone sings), but our great motherland, the great leader, and the various socialist constructions that will have a huge impact on the future life of the people. It is the border people who are united into a big family, and the new Marriage Law that liberates many women from feudal and capitalist marriage systems. In short, it is a new life. No force can stop everyone from singing these new themes that occupy an important position in people's lives, and no force can stop everyone from using lyrical songs to sing the emotions that are stirring in people's hearts. This makes lyrical songs break away from the narrow circle of life and enter the broad garden of people's lives. This is not only an expansion of themes, but more importantly, it strengthens the social significance of lyrical songs.

    Some comrades believe that lyrical songs must have a specific form, for example, they must be written as solo songs. This is almost unnecessary to explain. Solo songs may be convenient for expressing emotions, the tunes can be more free, there is more possibility of using various vocal techniques, and there are fewer technical restrictions; but it cannot be concluded that lyrical songs can only adopt the form of solo songs, and it is impossible to write lyrical songs in the form of unison (including mass unison). Many of the lyrical songs among the winning songs may be suitable for solo singing, but some are more suitable for unison singing. There is another idea that should also be overcome, that is, thinking that lyrical songs must use complex techniques and must be written to be difficult to sing. It should be seen that the complexity of the techniques used, the difficulty of singing, and the depth of expressing emotions do not have an inevitable connection, and are not necessarily proportional. Many times they are inversely proportional. For example, "In February," "March in Jiangnan," "Yellow River Ode," and many songs of this kind among the winning songs, such as "Weaving Song," "Glory Lamp," and "The Sun Rises on the Grassland," adopt extremely simple forms, but the emotions expressed are not superficial.

    The relationship between lyrical songs as a song genre and the lyricism of general songs also needs to be clarified.

    It should be affirmed that any song form is to express the thoughts and feelings of individuals or collectives in the people in real life. Therefore, they all have a lyrical effect; but as a specific genre, lyrical songs have their specific significance, especially when compared with narrative songs, satirical songs, and marching-style battle songs, it becomes clearer. Lyrical songs, no matter what theme they choose, no matter what form they adopt (solo, unison, duet, or chorus), are always good at unfolding a broad spiritual world for the audience. Their tunes always appear comfortable, free, and approachable, making you happy to follow them to the wilderness of the spirit, as if they have opened the curtain of life for you, allowing you to look forward to the panoramic view of life today and tomorrow, and thus your emotions are excited. Therefore, lyrical songs are often the most able to show the spiritual world of the people without hiding, often express the truth of life in the most beautiful form, and are often thought-provoking and full of infectious music. These are naturally beyond the capacity of narrative songs, satirical songs, and marching-style battle songs.

    Some comrades pointed out that at present, because many songwriters simply and one-sidedly understand "music should serve the current political struggle," they have neglected the need to create various lyrical songs. Therefore, almost all songs are marches, almost all are mass unison singing, and the mood is very monotonous, unable to reflect the rich reality and meet the needs of the masses. This is completely correct. There are many reasons for this situation. The main thing is that, on the one hand, some people have a narrow and one-sided understanding of the fact that music must express the masses and must obey political tasks. For example, some people think that the protagonist of love songs must be a labor model, otherwise they lack ideology, but they do not delve into whether the ideological emotions of the song itself are healthy. They have some contempt for some lyrical songs that are not directly related to the general line of propaganda and increasing production and practicing economy, thinking that they lack a serious meaning in life, and mechanically require all songs to express the current real political struggle. Some cadres simply think that they are unhealthy and have petty-bourgeois sentimental emotions when they hear relatively soft and deep tunes, without taking the time to analyze them carefully. All of these may become an invisible pressure, affecting the composers' inability to create lyrical songs without scruples. But on the other hand, we cannot deny that some songs, which may not necessarily be lyrical songs, do have some unhealthy elements, replacing the new, optimistic, and healthy people's emotions with personal, outdated, and frivolous emotions. "The Sky in the Liberated Area" and "Song of Mao Zedong" that were widely popular in the past are obvious examples. Of course, it is inappropriate to casually put the petty-bourgeois label on certain songs without analysis, but it is equally harmful to abandon the criticism of works with serious shortcomings. That would create ideological confusion, and bourgeois ideological tendencies and various vulgar ideological emotions would get a breeding ground for development, and lyrical songs would have the possibility of taking a gray and decadent road.

    The new reality has brought a rich spiritual life, and the broad masses need new lyrical songs. Creating more and better people's lyrical songs is our current urgent task. Studying the new experiences provided by the lyrical songs in the winning songs and clarifying many vague views is of practical significance for the development of lyrical songs.

Four, National Form

    The winning songs also provide rich experience on the issue of national form. This article does not intend to discuss the general issues involved in national form, but only to talk about the issue of national form in musical language, because this is often the center of our debate.

    It can be seen from all the songs participating in this award that all the composers, due to the universal education of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, under the influence of the mass songs of Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, the road taken in the creation of musical language is basically correct. Whether they are young composers, older composers, composers who are deeply influenced by Western music, or composers who have less contact with folk music, they are all striving to create a musical language that is suitable for expressing the ideological sentiments of the masses and is understood by them. This effort should be affirmed. It is precisely because everyone is striving to pursue this musical language that mass songs are becoming more and more popular with the masses.

    Although our direction of effort is correct, there are problems and difficulties in the creation of musical language. There are also vague views on the creation of musical language. It is precisely because our understanding of this issue is not yet completely clear that our difficulties seem difficult to overcome.

    What are some of the difficulties in the creation of musical language? According to what everyone usually puts forward and what is revealed in the works, the main difficulty lies in not being able to create a musical language that is as easy, concise, rich, lively, and emotionally distinct as that used by Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, which is easy for the masses to understand and master; the difficulty lies in not being able to construct novel, authentic, and infectious musical images with our musical language, as achieved by folk music; the difficulty lies in not being able to create a musical language with a distinct national style, thought-provoking, and able to correctly express the rich spiritual world of the Chinese people.

    Although the difficulties everyone actually encounters are so arduous, the analysis of the causes of these difficulties is often insufficient, superficial, or even very subjective. Some comrades one-sidedly believe that the national style in musical language is only composed of the external form of language—the external rules of intonation and tune composition—the mode. Therefore, they simply believe that as long as they are based on the level tones of Chinese characters, the intonation of daily language, plus the modal rules summarized from some folk music, they can create a musical language with a national style that can express the new life as they wish. Therefore, they believe that they can create out of thin air while sitting in the house, completely ignoring the in-depth understanding and research of the internal factors that constitute the national style in musical language—the emotional emotions of the people, completely ignoring the development history of the people's spiritual life, and the potential huge role of the new ideological emotions that are changing every day in the national style of musical language. Obviously, it is incomplete and incorrect to understand the national style as a simple, external, and completely technical feature. Based on such a one-sided understanding, how can the national style in musical language be deeply solved?

    Some comrades also simply believe that the national form of musical language has a fixed form, which does not develop and does not allow absorbing foreign factors. Therefore, it must be the same as or similar to a certain folk musical language. People with such views often check every bar of the creation they come into contact with according to these principles. If they find that some places do not conform to their principles, they will list this work outside the scope of their fixed national form, no matter how much the masses love it, and cannot reduce his opposition. The reason why many comrades do not recognize that songs such as "Ode to the Motherland" have a national style is related to this view. Obviously, this view is very narrow. It should be seen that people's lives are developing, people's music is developing with people's lives, and the common characteristics of people's music in each era—national form is also developing. In the process of development, it is necessary to absorb some new and foreign factors, and at the same time, it is necessary to abandon some outdated and inherent factors. Our own folk songs, operas, and storytelling music are also constantly absorbing foreign factors and gradually forming today's form. In the past, it was completely different from the current appearance. It goes without saying that the style of folk song tunes recorded by Ming Dynasty musician Zhu Zaiyu is very different from today's folk song tunes. Taking Ping Opera and Yue Opera as examples, there have been many changes in the tunes of twenty years ago compared to today's tunes. Therefore, national style cannot be understood as a fixed and unchanging form. The musical culture of any nation has relations with other nations, even in the past when transportation was not developed; and no nation's musical culture will not be affected by foreign music and will not absorb the beneficial factors of foreign music. There is no need to list the facts of mutual influence of musical cultures in modern Western European countries, and there is no need to cite the facts of mutual influence of musical cultures between China and Eastern countries in the past. According to the folk songs collected by the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music in Hequ, Shanxi, the strong influence of Mongolian folk songs on Hequ folk songs is obvious, and the mountain songs in Hunan and Guangxi also obviously have the influence of Miao music. It should be pointed out that the reason why the masses are willing to accept a new style of music is also because it is deeply connected with the people's ideological emotions, national psychological characteristics, and national language characteristics, and it does express this nation's new life emotions, an extremely important life emotion, the people's revolutionary, patriotic, and internationalist ideological emotions. Why can't many excellent songs that have been tested by the masses, such as Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and other composers, as well as many excellent mass songs in this award, be recognized as having a national style? It should be affirmed that this part is also a national form, but it is a developed national form, which is also a constituent part of our national music tradition. Although the history of this part is relatively short and there are still some problems, it is a new and revolutionary musical tradition. If some comrades are unwilling to recognize this part of the tradition, it is either because conservative ideas are at work, or they are poisoned by the idea of neglecting politics.

    Some comrades simply use the existing musical acceptance ability of farmers as the standard for judging whether it has a national style, which is obviously not suitable. Some comrades do not recognize that the musical language of songs such as "Ode to the Motherland" has a national style, mainly because many farmers cannot sing such songs well today. Of course, farmers are an important part of the masses, and the number is very large. If the existing musical acceptance ability of farmers is used as the only standard for judging whether it has a national style, and everything that farmers cannot fully accept today is not considered to have a national style and must be removed from our national life, it will inevitably make our musical culture weak. This view is obviously wrong and narrow. Mass song creation should fully consider the farmers' acceptance ability and their preferences, but it should not regard the farmers' acceptance ability and preferences as something that will never change. The patriotic ideological emotions embodied in songs such as "Ode to the Motherland" are also in line with the ideological emotions of the broad masses of farmers who have turned over. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that they will never be able to accept such songs just because they cannot fully accept them today, and it cannot be concluded that such songs have no national style, because the main sign of national style lies in whether it truly expresses the people's advanced ideological emotions. Moreover, in fact, the situation of farmers after the turnover has changed greatly. Their ideological awareness is increasing day by day, their cultural level is increasing day by day, and the possibility of accepting new things is increasing day by day. Young farmers in various places have begun to like to sing new songs such as "Ode to the Motherland." How can we think that songs like "Ode to the Motherland" do not have a national style and cannot be listed in our national form?

    Of course, this does not mean that our winning songs have completely and perfectly solved the problem of national style in musical language. It should be admitted that there are still many problems that have not been solved. Even in the winning songs, there are still some works whose musical language cannot constitute novel, authentic, and infectious musical images. On the one hand, we must oppose the above-mentioned narrow views, and at the same time, we must not relax the criticism of the wrong tendency of neglecting national music traditions and national style. Some comrades believe that to express the advanced ideological emotions of new characters, it is necessary to create a new musical language, completely abandoning the original national musical form, and the new musical language and new musical form can naturally only be learned from foreign countries, or created out of thin air, which is actually impossible. This is obviously an extremely wrong understanding. Such comrades completely ignore the basic role of the national music tradition in creating a new musical language, and distort Chairman Mao's principle of "bringing forth the new from the old." The new musical language created according to this understanding must be detached from the people. Some comrades, based on the extremely limited folk music materials they possess, summarize the national style into several specious principles, as the guidelines for creating the national style, which is not only very subjective, but also a very ridiculous and laughable behavior.

    The national style in musical language is by no means created out of thin air by detaching from the actual life of the people and the national music tradition. The conservative idea of refusing to absorb new factors will inevitably hinder the development of the national style and the formation of a new national style.

    In solving the problem of national style in musical language, many comrades have done a lot of work, but some work needs to be improved. Because our understanding of the national style is not deep, and we have not seen the huge role of the people's spiritual life in creating the national style, we have not only failed to deeply study the people's spiritual life and the new ideological qualities that have grown rapidly, especially we are not good at using various folk music and creative songs that live in the mouths of the people to deeply study the people's lives and the changes that have taken place in their spirits, as well as their new requirements for music; therefore, many of our comrades are satisfied with studying folk music from books (of course, this is necessary), but ignore studying folk music in connection with the actual life of the people. The knowledge obtained in this way is of course dead, and it is only formal and lacks soul.

    If, through this award, these vague views in the problem of national form in musical language can be clarified, and many practices can be changed, the difficulties that have hindered us from moving forward can be gradually overcome, and our musical language can be raised to a new level of national style, we will be able to more powerfully express the rich spiritual world of the Chinese people.

Five, More Powerfully Inspiring the Working People

    In the past three years, we have done some meaningful work, reflecting the huge changes and new ideological emotions that have taken place in the people's lives, but it is far from meeting the needs of reality. Although the authors have paid attention to expressing major and sharp themes in life, they have not expressed these themes from various aspects, different angles, and different forms. The praise for the motherland, the leader, the People's Volunteers, and the new life is still only in relatively simple language, lacking higher generalization and expressiveness, and lacking in-depth characterization. We have created some musical images, but we have not been able to characteristically summarize the ideological and emotional characteristics of the heroes of this era in our musical images, and we have not been able to deeply inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of our national music, and create moving and unforgettable music. Many songs are still suffering from severe anemia, lacking both people's emotions and the necessary technical weapons. We must continue to deepen our life experience, study technology hard, and conscientiously improve our ideological and artistic level, so that we can not only obtain strong people's emotions and the ability to keenly recognize life, but also obtain a high ability to express life.

    Close cooperation between songwriters is a necessary condition for producing excellent works. Thanks to the lyricists for writing many beautiful poems for us! In the future, we welcome more poets to write more and more touching lyrics for everyone!

    Only through continuous creative practice can we gradually overcome the shortcomings in creation, and only by strengthening creative practice can we consolidate the existing positions. The new reality requires us to continue to improve and move forward on the existing basis. Both winning and non-winning authors need to continue to work hard and strive to create more and better works. Let us continue to throw ourselves into the fiery struggle of the masses, turn the glorious new life into more authentic, more beautiful, and more infectious music, and more powerfully inspire the working people across the country to give full play to higher enthusiasm and greater creativity in the country's economic construction, and strive for the thorough realization of the general line, and strive for the early realization of a socialist society!

    各大行政区、军委总政治部文化部和中央人民政府文化部直属各艺术团体提出来参加评奖的歌曲共二百零八首，得奖的歌曲共一百一十四首。虽然这个数字很小（据中国音乐家协会一九五三年不完全统计，自中华人民共和国成立以来的几年中，各地产生了一万首群众歌曲），但它们都在一定程度上反映了新中国人民生活中的重大事件和精神生活上的巨大变化。“全世界人民心一条”、“歌唱祖国”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“王大妈要和平”、“歌唱毛泽东”、“我是一个兵”、“歌唱二郎山”等是在各地群众中流传最广的几首歌曲，不仅真实地反映了这个时期的社会生活，也鲜明地标志了这个时期中广大群众的思想情绪的巨大变化。这些歌曲里所表现的，是群众对于和平生活的愿望和保卫世界持久和平的坚强意志，是对于祖国对于领袖的热爱和歌颂，是对于人民解放军、中国人民志愿军在无数英雄事迹中所表现的高度爱国主义与国际主义精神的热情歌颂，是对于美帝国主义疯狂残暴的战争罪行的切齿仇恨。这些新的思想情绪同样也反映在许多少年儿童歌曲中，“小鸽子”是其中较优秀的一个例子。人民群众的这些新的思想情绪是从各种群众运动中，从根本改变了的社会生活中生长出来的，所以，也可以说，这些新的群众歌曲正确地反映了这个时期的社会生活的巨大变化。
    许多人也许还记得，我们曾经悲愤地唱过“中国人不打中国人”、“松花江上”、“铁蹄下的歌女”、“我们不怕流血”、“茶馆小调”和“你这个坏东西”等歌曲，这些凄切的、悲愤的调子所反映的生活和斗争已经成了历史陈迹。历史的车轮进入了新的时代，展开了灿烂的新生活。中国人民在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下，推翻了半封建、半殖民地的反动统治，赶走了帝国主义势力，消灭了封建地主阶级，建立了一个统一的、独立的、民主的、一天比一天更富强、更繁荣、更幸福的国家。在抗美援朝斗争中，在各种巨大的国防、经济建设事业中涌现了成千成万的英雄人物和先进分子，他们具有热爱祖国、热爱人民的新的思想品质，具有高度的劳动热忱和无限的创造力，对于生活怀着远大的理想，对于明天的幸福充满信心，相信集体的力量，不再相信命运，相信劳动能够创造一切，关心集体的利益远超过于个人。所有这些都表现了我们新的生活的面貌。
    中国共产党的正确的民族政策，使得长期受了国民党反动统治压迫的各兄弟民族过着历史上从未有过的民族区域自治的民主生活，三年来，各兄弟民族的人民歌手发挥了他们年青的无限丰富的创作力，各族人民产生了许多赞颂新社会、新生活的歌曲，流传最普遍的是赞颂毛主席的歌曲，这些赞歌实际上是歌颂新生活最集中的表现，所以特别洋溢着欢快、真挚而亲切的敬爱的感情。“歌唱毛泽东”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”正是这方面两首较优秀的代表。除此之外，当然还有许多歌颂新生活的优秀歌曲，如“向北京致敬”、“歌唱民族区域自治”、“纺织歌”等，这些歌曲，应该说是三年来产生的群众歌曲中特别值得重视的一部分。这些歌曲不仅成为产生这些作品的本民族人民最喜爱的歌曲，也成了我国各族人民所共有的宝贵的精神财富。
    在这一百多首得奖歌曲中，许多歌曲出自大家熟悉的歌曲作者之手，但有很大一部分歌曲作者的姓名对于大家都是十分生疏的，其中大部分作者是非常年青的，如阿不力克木、美丽其格、许瑞禄、岳仑、刘守义等同志；也有一些作者并不是专业的音乐工作者，如“为了幸福的明天”的作者孙振华同志，“我们都是新中国的英雄汉”的作者余绍华同志都是工厂工人。这些新的歌曲作者的涌现，不仅说明了在各民族年青的音乐工作者和业余的音乐爱好者当中蕴藏着无限的潜在力量，也说明了这些新的力量正在迅速地不停地生长。我们应该向他们表示最大的热情，欢迎他们的出现，尽管他们今天音乐修养还不够，但他们的作品已经表现了他们具有很高的曲调创作才能，事实上，他们的歌曲给我们带来了强烈的清新的气息，使得我们的歌曲艺术增加了新的光辉。只要他们不以此为满足，继续不断地刻苦学习，在大家热情的关心和帮助下，他们的音乐修养是可以逐渐提高的，这些新的年青的歌曲作者，无疑地，具有很大的发展前途，他们的作品是特别值得我们重视的。二、反映生活
    从这些得奖歌曲可以看出来，歌曲作者都是以极大的努力来歌颂新的生活和新的斗争，力求他们的作品真实地反映生活，真实地反映人民的思想情绪。有的作者是从现实生活中选取较大的政治主题或概括性较大的题材，反映现实生活中最普遍的思想情绪，如那些以歌颂祖国、歌颂领袖、保卫世界和平、抗美援朝、中苏友好、保卫边疆、土地改革、镇压反革命为主题的歌曲；有的作者是截取主要斗争生活的一个侧面，或从日常生活中选取某些极平常的事物作为题材，却表现了群众最深刻的思想情绪，同样达到了真实地反映生活，如那些以小鸽子、小红旗、光荣灯、刺刀、转盘枪、手榴弹、牛、纺织、剪羊毛等为题材的歌曲。
      “全世界人民心一条”、“歌唱祖国”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”、“伟大的毛泽东”、“王大妈要和平”、“歌唱二郎山”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”、“我是一个兵”之所以广泛地流传在全国群众中，不仅表明了广大群众需要这样的歌曲表达他们热爱和平、热爱祖国、热爱领袖的思想情绪和不怕困难的精神；“新疆好”、“淮河两岸鲜花开”、“光荣灯”、“纺织歌”、“小鸽子”以及其他许多歌曲之所以受到群众热烈的欢迎，不仅表明了群众满意于这些歌曲真实地表现了他们的生活、劳动和斗争中的乐观情绪，对于生活的理想和希望；更重要的，是深刻地说明了真实地反映生活，不是要求反映随便什么生活，而是首先要反映劳动人民的新的生活和新的斗争；不是一般地去反映新的生活和斗争，而是要求反映新的生活和斗争中的群众的最深刻的思想情绪，那些即使今天还只是萌芽、却在迅速生长着的先进的思想情绪。必须这样，群众歌曲才具有真实的社会意义，才能从思想感情上去提高与教育人民，才具有推动社会前进的力量，才能充分发挥它的武器作用。
    虽然有些人由于看到某些歌曲作者为服从当前某一具体政治任务而创作的歌曲不曾得到应有的成功，因而怀疑群众歌曲是否应该为具体政治任务服务。应该指出，群众歌曲作为一种特殊的斗争武器，不可能、也不应该脱离广大群众所参加的当前的现实的政治斗争。但由于作者对于当前斗争任务认识不深，或者对于群众生活缺乏深刻的体验，或者缺乏应有的表现技巧，或者根本缺乏深厚的政治热情，因而写出来的作品缺乏真实的生动的内容。可以这样说，正确地反映政治斗争中群众的情绪和要求，能够鼓励他们参加政治斗争的热情，能够提高群众的斗争积极性，对于政治斗争必然要发生一定的推动作用。显然地，如果群众歌曲没有这类歌曲，就会失去或减弱它在群众斗争生活中的地位和作用。自然，如果认为这就是群众歌曲的唯一任务，因而忽视了群众生活的更广阔的需要，那也是错误的。那样就把群众歌曲局限在一个狭小的范围内，就大大缩小了它的社会意义。
    如果歌曲作者认为表现当前政治斗争的歌曲可以不从群众生活出发，可以根据一些书面的原则指示、政策条文进行创作，那就必然要创作出一些概念化的歌词来，作曲者选取了这样的词就很难写出动人的曲调来，即使有人为它作了一首优美的、很有情绪的曲调，仍然不能给群众以深刻的感动，群众也不会喜爱这样的歌曲。我们曾经看到有这样一首歌曲，歌词的第一段是这样的：
        “苏联是社会主义国家，咱们要好好学习
    它，它建设事业办法多，工业、农业都发
    达；劳动人民做主人，克服困难靠大家；它
    各个民族团结的好，全国人民像一家；人人
    劳动功绩大，到处开放着幸福的花。”谁能想到这是一首歌词呢？这一段已经足够使我们了解这首歌词概念化到了什么程度，这完全不是富有生活形象的诗的语言构成的富有感染力的歌词，也不可能给群众以情绪上的感染，作者完全忘记了这些要求。从题目起就可以看出作者对于群众歌曲的误解，题目是“学习苏联建设祖国”，这种误解明显地表现了作者不明白歌曲是要通过艺术的形象来服务于政治，来对人民起宣传教育的作用，有这样误解的人不在少数，就在得奖歌曲中的歌词也有类似的缺点，如“争取月月满堂红”，“中苏人民团结紧”，“新中国力量大”等歌曲。
    另外，我们也看到有这样一首歌词：
            “战争贩子滚出去，滚出去，滚出去，
    滚出朝鲜，滚出亚洲，滚出全世界，滚出全
    世界去，滚出去！爱好和平的人民团结起来
    了，绝不让你们再猖狂，千万把钢刀刺穿你
    的心，你们的命运就是死亡。”
    不用说，通过群众歌曲反映并且提高我国人民对于美国战争贩子的仇恨情绪是必要的，作者选择这个题材是正确的。不过，作者在这里既没有写出美国战争贩子带给朝鲜人民的灾难和痛苦，也一点没有写到中朝人民热爱和平、反对侵略战争的崇高的生活理想，因此，很难激起听众的仇恨情绪。在这八句词中，一共用了八个“滚出去”，在合唱中各声部前后共反复了三十六次“滚出去”，也许作者以为“滚出去”叫得越多，咒骂就越有力（其实不应该只是咒骂），表现反对战争贩子愤激情绪就越强。其实这样并没有表达出群众的愤激情绪，相反，倒是暴露了作者生活的贫乏。
    用这样的歌曲去服务当前具体政治任务，任何时候也不会有什么效果的。这些同志完全忽视了群众歌曲必须凭借它的特殊的思维形式和富有感染力的生活形象，而且必须通过听众情绪上的激动，达到思想意识上的变化，才能发挥它的宣传教育的武器作用。歌曲是诗与音乐结合起来的艺术形式，要求丰富的思想内容，却不能以概念来代替由生活形象带来的现实的诗意；它要求优美的、真实的音乐形象，旨在启发人们向上的情绪，鼓舞人们的忠实于伟大理想，勇往直前，奋不顾身的精神，成为行动中的积极力量；却不是通过它去作条文的解释，枯燥地述说某种道理。
      三、抒情歌曲
    抒情歌曲对于我们虽然不是一种新的创作形式，但大家对于抒情歌曲的理解却不完全一致。
    三年来创作的抒情歌曲，在数量上、质量上虽不能满足客观的需要，却有了新的发展，提供了一些新的经验。
    首先要谈的，是关于抒情歌曲的主题和题材问题。
    三年来，大家不仅创作了广大群众十分欢迎的
  “歌唱祖国”、“歌唱毛泽东”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”、“歌唱二郎山”、“王大妈要和平”，也有歌颂边疆人民生活的“欢乐的新疆”，歌颂社会主义建设的“淮河两岸鲜花开”，歌颂妇女劳动支援解放战争的“纺织歌”，歌颂军属的“光荣灯”，歌颂新婚姻法的“茶树开花圆丁丁”等许多抒情歌曲，为抒情歌曲开拓了广阔的天地。这些歌曲在认识生活、表现生活，特别在音乐语言创造上都是有成就的，把我国人民作为新生活的创造者的新的精神品质，作了色彩鲜明的描绘。
    从主题和题材方面来看，几乎可以说没有什么限制，从歌颂祖国、歌颂领袖，到歌颂边疆人民生活、歌颂新婚姻法，凡是在人民生活中具有积极意义的，于人民有益的题材，都包括了。这显然是一个重要的发展，打破了对于抒情歌曲的传统理解。这是很自然的事情，在旧社会中，政治是黑暗的，不许人民过问，人民愿意、并且能够自由歌唱的，除了爱情、友情和自然界以外，还有什么呢？可是在新社会中，特别在全国解放后的三年中，人们首先想歌唱的、却不是爱情、友情和自然（虽然仍然是大家歌唱的题材），而是我们伟大的祖国、伟大的领袖，是对于今后人民的生活将发生巨大作用的各种社会主义建设，是团结成为一个大家庭的边疆人民，是把许多妇女从封建的、资本主义的婚姻制度下解放出来的新婚姻法，总之，是新的生活。没有什么力量可以阻止大家不歌唱这些在人民生活中占有重大地位的、新的主题，没有什么力量可以阻止大家用抒情歌曲歌唱人民心中激荡着的情绪。这就使抒情歌曲脱离了狭小的生活圈子，走进了群众生活的广阔园地。这不仅是主题的扩大，更重要的，是加强了抒情歌曲的社会意义。
    有些同志认为抒情歌曲必须具有特定的形式，比方说，必须写成独唱歌曲。这几乎是无须多加解释的，独唱歌曲也许便利于抒情，曲调可以更自由些，运用各种声乐技巧的可能性更大些，技术上的限制更小些；但不能因此认为抒情歌曲只能采用独唱歌曲形式，齐唱（包括群众齐唱）形式不可能写抒情歌曲。得奖歌曲中的许多抒情歌曲，也许都可以独唱，但有些更适合于齐唱。还有另一种思想也是应该克服的，那就是以为抒情歌曲必须运用复杂的技巧，必须写得难唱一些。应该看到，所运用的技巧的复杂程度，难唱的程度和表现感情的深度并没有必然的联系，不一定是成正比例的，许多时候是成反比例的。比方“二月里来”、“江南三月”、“黄河颂”，得奖歌曲中的“纺织歌”、“光荣灯”、“草原上升起不落的太阳”等许多这一类的歌曲，采取了极其朴素的形式，所表现的情绪却并不是肤浅的。
    作为一种歌曲体裁的抒情歌和一般歌曲的抒情性之间的关系，也是需要弄清楚的。
    应该肯定，任何歌曲形式，都是抒发人民群众中的个人或集体在现实生活中的思想感情的。因此都具有抒情的作用；但是作为一种特定的体裁，抒情歌曲是有其特定的意义的，特别是和叙事歌曲、讽刺歌曲、以及进行曲式的战斗歌曲来比较就更清楚。抒情歌曲，不论它选取什么主题，不论采用什么形式（独唱、齐唱、重唱或合唱），总是善于为听众展开广阔的精神世界，它的曲调总是显得舒畅、自由、可亲，使你乐于随着它走向精神上的旷野，仿佛它为你揭开了生活的帐幕，使你展望着今天和明天的生活全景，因而你情绪激动。所以抒情歌曲常常总是最能够无隐藏地显示人民的精神世界，常常是以最优美的形式表现了生活的真实，也常常是引人深思，并且富有感染力的音乐。这些自然都不是叙事歌曲、讽刺歌曲、进行曲式的战斗歌曲所能胜任的。
    有些同志指出，目前由于许多歌曲作者简单地片面地理解“音乐应该服务于当前政治斗争”，忽略了创作各种抒情歌曲的需要，因此所有的歌曲几乎都是进行曲，几乎都是群众齐唱，情趣也十分单调，不能反映丰富的现实和满足群众的要求，这是完全正确的。造成这种情况的原因是多方面的。主要的是，一方面有些人对于音乐必须表现群众，必须服从政治任务有些狭隘的片面的了解，如有人认为爱情歌曲的主人公必须是劳动模范，否则就是缺乏思想性，对于歌曲本身的思想情绪是否健康，却不去深入研究。对于某些不与宣传总路线、增产节约直接有关的抒情歌曲怀有几分轻视，认为缺乏严肃的生活意义，机械地要求所有的歌曲都要表现当前的现实的政治斗争。有的干部一听到比较柔和、深沉的曲调，还没有来得及细加分析，就简单地认为不健康，带有小资产阶级感伤情绪。所有这些可能都成为一种无形的压力，影响了作曲者不能无顾虑地创作抒情歌曲。但另一方面，我们也不能否认，有些歌曲，其实不一定都是抒情歌曲，确实有些不健康的成分，是以个人的、陈旧的、轻浮的情感代替了新的、乐观的、健康的人民情绪。曾经广泛流行过的“解放区的天”、“毛泽东之歌”就是明显的例子。固然缺乏分析地随便给某些歌戴上小资产阶级的帽子是不恰当的，但因此放弃对于有严重缺点的作品的批评，同样是有害的；那样要造成思想上的混乱，资产阶级思想倾向以及各种庸俗的思想情绪就会得到发育的温床，抒情歌曲就有走向灰色的、颓废的道路的可能。
    新的现实带来了丰富的精神生活，广大的群众需要新的抒情歌曲，创造更多更好的人民的抒情歌曲是我们当前急迫的任务，研究得奖歌曲中的抒情歌曲所提供的新的经验，澄清许多模糊观点，对于发展抒情歌曲是有实际意义的。四、民族形式
    得奖歌曲，在民族形式问题上，也提供了丰富的经验。这里不打算就民族形式所涉及的全般问题来讨论，只就音乐语言中民族形式问题来谈谈，因为这常常是我们争论的中心。
    从参加这次评奖的全部歌曲中看得出来，所有的作曲者，由于普遍受到了毛主席的文艺思想的教育，在聂耳与冼星海同志的群众歌曲影响下，在音乐语言创造上所走的道路，基本上是正确的。无论是青年作曲家，年纪较大的作曲家，无论是受西洋音乐影响较深的作曲家，或是对民间音乐接触较少的作曲家，都在努力追求创造一种适合于表达群众的思想情绪，又为他们所理解的音乐语言，这种努力是应该肯定的，正是由于大家在努力追求这种音乐语言，群众歌曲才日益具有更大的群众性。
    虽然我们的努力方向是正确的，但在音乐语言创造上不是没有问题，不是没有困难，对于创造音乐语言也不是没有模糊观点；正是由于我们对于这问题的认识还没有完全明确，我们的困难才显得难以克服。
    在音乐语言创造上有些什么困难呢？根据大家平常提出来的和作品中表露的，主要的困难在于不能创造出像聂耳和冼星海同志使用的那种平易、简练、丰富、活泼、情绪鲜明容易为群众理解、也容易为群众掌握的音乐语言；困难在于用我们的音乐语言不能构成新颖、真实、富有感染力的音乐形象，像民间音乐所达到的那样；困难在于不能创造出具有鲜明的民族风格、引人深思的、能够正确表达我国人民的丰富的精神世界的音乐语言。
    虽然大家实际遇到的困难是如此艰巨，可是对于形成这些困难的原因的分析常常是不足的，表面的，甚至于是十分主观的。有的同志片面地以为音乐语言上的民族风格仅仅是由语言的外形——语调和曲调构成的外部法则——调式构成的。因此，简单的以为只要根据中国文字的平仄、日常语言的语调，加上从某些民间音乐归纳出来的调式法则，就可以称心如意地创造出具有民族风格能够表现新生活的音乐语言来，因此以为可以坐在房子里凭空进行创造，完全忽视了对于构成音乐语言上的民族风格的内部因素——人民的生活情绪的深入了解与研究，完全抹煞了人民的精神生活的发展历史，每天都在改变着的新的思想情绪对于音乐语言的民族风格所发生的潜在的巨大作用。把民族风格理解为一种简单的、外在的、完全技术性的特征，显然是不全面的、不正确的。根据这样的片面理解，怎么能够深入地解决音乐语言上的民族风格呢？
    也有同志简单地以为音乐语言的民族形式具有一种固定形式，是不发展的，也不允许吸取外来因素，因此，必须和某种民间音乐语言相同或相似。具有这样见解的人常常会根据这些原则去检视他所接触的创作的每一小节的曲调，如果发现有某些地方不符合他的原则，他就会把这首作品列在他的固定的民族形式范围以外，不管它所反映的思想情绪是群众的，群众如何热爱，也不能减少他的反对情绪。许多同志之不承认“歌唱祖国”这类歌曲具有民族风格，就与这种见解有关。很明显，这种见解是很狭隘的，应该看到，人民生活是发展的，人民音乐是随着人民生活而发展的，作为每个时代的人民音乐的共同特征——民族形式也是发展的，发展过程中一定要吸取一些新的、外来的因素，同时一定要抛弃一些陈旧的、固有的因素，我们自己的民歌、戏曲、说唱音乐也是不断地吸取了外来因素，逐渐形成今天的形式，过去就完全不是现在的样子。不用说明代音乐家朱载堉记录的民歌曲调和现在的民歌曲调在风格上有很大的不同，就以评戏、越剧为例，二十年前的曲调和今天的曲调相比就有很多改变，所以民族风格不能理解为固定不变的形式，任何一个民族的音乐文化没有不和其他民族发生关系的，即使在过去交通不发达的时代；也没有一个民族的音乐文化不会受到外来音乐的影响，不吸收外来音乐的有益因素，毋须乎列举近代西欧各国音乐文化相互影响的事实，也毋须引用过去中国与东方各国的音乐文化的相互影响的事实，根据中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所最近采集的山西河曲一带的民歌就明显地看出蒙古族民歌对于河曲民歌的强烈的影响，湖南、广西一带的山歌也明显地有苗族音乐的影响。应该指出，群众所以乐于接受一种新的风格的音乐，同样因为它是根据人民的思想情绪、民族的心理特征和民族语言的特征、和民族音乐传统具有深刻联系，而且又确实表现了这个民族的新的生活情绪，极其重要的一种生活情绪，人民革命的、爱国主义的、国际主义的思想情绪，如聂耳、冼星海和其他作曲家的许多经过群众考验的优秀歌曲，以及这次评奖中的许多优秀的群众歌曲，为什么不可以承认它们具有民族风格呢？应该肯定这一部分也是民族形式，不过是发展了的民族形式，这也是我们民族音乐传统中的一个构成部分。虽然这一部分的历史比较短，尚存在若干问题，但它是新生的革命的音乐传统。有些同志不愿意承认这部分传统，那如果不是保守主义思想在作祟，就是受了忽视政治的思想的毒害。
    还有些同志简单地根据农民现有的音乐接受能力作为判断是否具有民族风格的标准，显然是不适合的。有些同志不承认“歌唱祖国”这类歌曲的音乐语言具有民族风格，主要因为有许多农民今天还不能唱好这样的歌曲。固然，农民是群众中的一个重要部分，而且数量很大，如果把农民现有的音乐接受能力作为判断是否具有民族风格的唯一标准，凡是农民今天还不能完全接受的都不算是具有民族风格的，都要从我们民族生活中剔除开去，那就必然要使我们的音乐文化变得贫弱起来。这种看法显然是错误的、狭隘的。群众歌曲创作完全应该考虑农民的接受能力和他们的喜爱，但不应该把农民的接受能力和喜爱看成是永远不变的东西，像“歌唱祖国”这首歌曲所体现的爱国主义的思想情绪，也是符合于翻了身的广大农民的思想情绪的，所以不能因为他们今天还不能完全接受，就认为他们永远不能接受，更不能因此就认为这样的歌曲没有民族风格，因为民族风格的主要标志，是在于它是否真实地表现了人民的先进的思想感情。何况事实上翻身后的农民的情况有了很大的改变，思想觉悟一天比一天提高，文化水平一天比一天提高，接受新事物的可能一天比一天增大，各地青年农民都开始喜欢唱“歌唱祖国”这些新的歌曲。我们怎么能认为“歌唱祖国”这类歌曲不具有民族风格，不能列在我们的民族形式之中呢？
    当然这不是说我们的得奖歌曲已经全部完满地解决了音乐语言上的民族风格问题，应该承认，还有许多问题没有得到解决，就在得奖歌曲中，也还有些作品中的音乐语言不能构成新颖、真实、富有感染力的音乐形象。我们一方面要反对上述那些狭隘的观点，同时也不能放松对于忽视民族音乐传统与民族风格的错误倾向的批评。有的同志认为表现新人物的先进思想感情必须创造新的音乐语言，完全抛弃原有的民族音乐形式，而新的音乐语言和新的音乐形式，自然只有向外国去学，或者凭空创造，事实上是不可能的。这显然是一种极端错误的认识。这样的同志完全忽视了民族音乐传统对于创造新的音乐语言的基础作用，曲解了毛主席的“推陈出新”的原则。根据这种认识创造出来的新的音乐语言必然是脱离人民的。有的同志根据自己占有的极有限的民间音乐材料，把民族风格归纳成为几条似是而非的原则，作为创作民族风格的准绳，不仅是十分主观的，也是十分荒唐可笑的行为。
    音乐语言上的民族风格决不是脱离人民生活实际和民族音乐传统凭空创造出来的，拒绝吸取新的因素的保守思想，也必然要妨碍民族风格的发展与新的民族风格的形成。
    在解决音乐语言的民族风格问题上，许多同志进行了许多工作，但有些工作是需要改进的。由于我们对于民族风格认识不深，没有看到人民的精神生活在创造民族风格中的巨大作用，不仅没有深入研究人民的精神生活，猛烈地成长起来的新的思想品质，特别不善于通过各种各样活在人民口头的民间音乐和创作歌曲，深入研究人民的生活和他们精神上发生的变化，以及他们对于音乐的新的要求；因此，我们许多同志满足于从书本上研究民间音乐
  （当然，这是必要的），却忽视了联系人民实际生活去研究民间音乐，这样所得来的知识当然是死的东西，而且只是形式上的、缺乏灵魂的。
    如果能通过这次评奖，澄清了音乐语言的民族形式问题中的这些模糊观点，并且能够改变许多做法，曾经阻碍着我们不能前进的困难，就可以逐渐克服，把我们的音乐语言向新的民族风格再提高一步，就能够更有力地表现我国人民的丰富的精神世界。五、更有力地鼓舞劳动人民
    三年来，我们做了些有意义的工作，反映了人民生活中所发生的巨大变化和新的思想情绪，但是远不能满足现实的需要。作者们虽注意了表现生活中重大的尖锐的主题，却没有从生活的各个侧面，不同的角度，用不同的形式去表现这些主题，对于祖国、领袖、人民志愿军和新生活的歌颂还只用了比较简单的语言，缺乏更高的概括力和表现力，还缺乏深入人心的刻划。我们创造了一些音乐形象，但还没有能够把这个时代的英雄人物的思想情绪特征地概括在我们的音乐形象中，还没有能够深入地继承与发扬我们民族音乐的优秀传统，创造出动人心魄的、梦寐难忘的音乐，许多歌曲还患着严重的贫血症，既缺乏人民情绪，也缺乏必要的技术武装。我们必须继续加深生活体验，刻苦地钻研技术，认真提高我们的思想水平和艺术水平，使我们不但获得强烈的人民情绪，敏锐的认识生活的能力，同时也获得高度的表现生活的能力。
    歌曲作者密切地合作，是产生优秀的作品必须的条件。感谢词作者为我们写了许多优美的诗篇！今后欢迎更多的诗人为大家写作更多的、更动人的歌词！
    只有经过不断的创作实践才能逐步克服创作上的缺点，也只有加强创作实践才能巩固已有的阵地。新的现实要求我们在现有的基础上继续提高、前进。得奖和没有得奖的作者都需要继续努力，争取创造更多更好的作品。大家继续投身到群众火热的斗争中去吧，把光辉灿烂的新生活变成更真实、更优美、更富有感染的音乐，更有力地鼓舞全国劳动人民在祖国的经济建设中发挥更高的积极性和更大的创造性，争取总路线的彻底实现，争取社会主义社会提前实现！
