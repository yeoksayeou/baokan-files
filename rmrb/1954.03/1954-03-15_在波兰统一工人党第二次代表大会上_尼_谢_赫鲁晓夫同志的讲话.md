Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's Speech at the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party
    Dear Comrades! On this memorable day for People's Poland, as the Polish United Workers' Party holds its Second Congress, I extend to you, and through you to the Polish United Workers' Party and all the Polish people, heartfelt and fraternal congratulations on behalf of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people (stormy, prolonged applause, all rise).

    The free people of our friendly Poland, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, are building a new, socialist life with heroic labor. Our Party, the Soviet people, sincerely rejoice in every achievement you have made on this glorious path.

    The achievements of the Polish people make us particularly happy, because we ourselves have traveled this great socialist path, and based on our own experience, we believe that this is the only true path that leads the working people to freedom and happiness, and to the vigorous development of all the life force of the people.

    In the struggle for the victory of a new social system, for liberation from social and national oppression, the working humanity is guided by the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    Under the leadership of the working class, the Polish people have, in a short period, transformed an economically backward, bourgeois and landlord Poland into an advanced people's democratic state. The People's Republic of Poland, managed by the people themselves and serving the interests of the people, now has a highly developed industry, a rapidly growing national economy, and a progressing and developing culture.

    The new democratic Poland is no longer the object of exploitation by foreign capital as it was in the past, the source of raw materials for imperialist countries, or a tool for imperialists to carry out aggression plans, engage in conspiracies, and make provocations. People's Poland – a free country, re-unified within its natural borders and consolidating its national independence – consistently pursues a policy of peace and international friendship, and is a firm link in the powerful democratic camp.

    This fact of great historical significance infuriates the imperialist bandits who are accustomed to treating the original Poland as a piece of fat meat.

    The great achievements of the Polish people on the road to building socialism make the Soviet people and all the loyal friends of People's Poland proud.

    The report made at your congress vividly depicts the struggle and victory of the Polish people, and the activities of the Central Committee and the government of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by the tested leader Comrade B. Bierut (stormy and prolonged applause).

    The Polish people are victoriously solving major and complex problems in economic and cultural development. The Polish working people have completed the Three-Year Economic Recovery Plan and are now implementing the Six-Year Plan with patriotic enthusiasm (which you correctly call the plan for national industrialization and laying the foundation for socialism).

    The achievements in the development of the national economy are enormous. In 1953, Poland's total industrial output had increased to 3.6 times that of 1938. The socialist component in industry has achieved absolute control. The republic's agriculture is developing.

    Last year's national income was twice that of 1938. Personal income has increased significantly, which shows that the material conditions of the working people have greatly improved compared to pre-war Poland. The Polish people are talented, and their science, literature, art, and culture are also advancing.

    The people's government, the Communist Party, and the Workers' Party have no, and cannot have any, interests above the interests of the people. They are most concerned about the welfare of the people, meeting the people's growing material and spiritual needs, and the prosperity of the country.

    Due to the achievements of People's Poland in developing industry, it has become necessary to further develop agriculture. Socialist industry supplies agriculture with more and more first-class equipment, fertilizers, and finished products. The working class is helping the working peasants every day. Further developing the country's agriculture is in the best interests of both workers and peasants. Only the comprehensive development of agriculture can guarantee the continuous improvement of the welfare of the working people.

    There is no doubt that, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people will achieve new successes in developing industry, vigorously developing agriculture, and improving the living standards of the working people in both urban and rural areas.

    The unbreakable alliance of the working class and the peasants is the foundation and invincible force of the people's democratic system. The rich experience of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and the experience of your country and other people's democratic countries in building the foundations of socialism, convincingly show that the victory of the new social system is only possible when the working class and the peasants, who constitute the overwhelming majority of society, form a solid alliance. In our country, it is precisely because of the alliance of the working class and the peasants that the exploiting classes were eliminated, the workers and peasants seized power, and a socialist society was established (applause).

    The great Lenin taught us that the worker-peasant alliance is the guarantee of our success and our final victory. Daily life proves this wise Leninist principle. Under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the Polish United Workers' Party is strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and consolidating the people's democratic state.

    Your achievements are undeniable, and honest men and women all over the world have seen these achievements, and the working people of all countries are extremely pleased to cheer for them.

    The achievements of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of your country, after heroic struggles and selfless labor, demonstrate that the people's democratic system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. The people's democratic system contains inexhaustible power, which can promote the continuous development of industry and agriculture, and can improve the material and cultural level of the working people. The advanced men and women among the working class, the working peasants, and the people's intellectuals have set outstanding examples, showing how to use these advantages and strengths to consolidate the people's democratic system.

    The great and vigorous strength of socialism lies in its unity of the peoples of all countries, not in dividing them.

    As everyone knows, there was a long period of very bad, sometimes hostile, relations between Tsarist Russia and aristocratic Poland, which caused pain to the people of Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania. This was the result of the anti-people policies pursued by the ruling classes, which hindered the establishment of friendly relations between the peoples of all countries.

    Historical facts show that the working people of Poland, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have always had many common interests. There are no, and cannot be, contradictions, hatred, or animosity between them (prolonged applause).

    In 1954, the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union celebrated a memorable historical event: the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. The struggle of the Ukrainian people to get rid of the rule of the Polish aristocracy and gain independence was warmly supported by the Polish peasants who groaned under the oppression of the Polish feudal landlords.

    In the war of liberation from 1648 to 1654, many soldiers in Bogdan Khmelnytsky's army were Polish peasants living in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people's war of liberation created favorable conditions for the armed struggle of the Polish peasants against their oppressors—the landlords and nobles. Khmelnytsky knew very well the feelings of the Polish peasants, and he said that in the coming struggle for Ukrainian independence, the Polish peasants would help him.

    The past provides many examples of personal friendship between Russian, Polish, and Ukrainian progressives, who, based on the common interests of the peoples of all nationalities, did their best to establish friendly relations between our nationalities.

    The great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and his close friend, the great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, had the same views. They jointly dreamed of a future—"when all nations will forget their quarrels and unite in one big family."

    However, the dreams of the best people of Poland and Russia about national friendship and the establishment of fraternal relations could not be realized for a long time. The obstacles created by the landlords and the bourgeois system to national friendship were too great.

    The great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, in a poem dedicated to the Polish revolutionary Bronisław Zaleski, called the latter his friend and brother, and angrily wrote that the greedy Polish nobles and Ukrainian landlords were provoking relations between the fraternal Polish and Ukrainian peoples, who sought peace and friendly coexistence.

    From the very beginning of its formation, the Polish working class fought side by side with the Russian working class against the common enemy—Russian autocracy, against capitalists and landlords. As early as fifty years ago, in the struggle of Russian and Polish workers against Tsarist oppression and against capitalists and landlords, our great leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin wrote: "...we will always say to the Polish workers: only the most thorough and intimate alliance with the Russian proletariat can meet the requirements of the current political struggle against autocracy; only such an alliance can guarantee complete political and economic liberation." (applause) During the first Russian revolution, Lenin cheered for the heroic proletariat of heroic Poland.

    The joint struggle of the Russian and Polish working people against the bourgeois and landlord regimes is vividly manifested in a significant fact: one of the leaders of the victorious Russian revolution, whom the Soviet people call the hero of the October Revolution, Felix Dzerzhinsky, was an outstanding fighter in the revolutionary working-class movement and a glorious son of the Polish people (prolonged and stormy applause).

    After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet government immediately announced unconditional recognition of Poland's sovereignty and independence. The leader of the Soviet government, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, pointed out that we have no disputes with the Polish peasants and workers, and we recognized in the past and still recognize now the independence of Poland and the People's Republic of Poland. But at that time, the anti-people Polish government refused to establish friendly relations with Soviet Russia.

    Our two peoples have established new relations, namely, the alliance and friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union, in the joint struggle against the common enemy—Nazi Germany. The friendship between our two peoples has been forever consolidated by the blood shed in this struggle (prolonged and stormy applause).

    Ten years ago, when the Soviet army, together with the Polish army, liberated Polish territory from the occupation of German fascist aggressors, favorable conditions were created for the establishment of a true people's regime in Poland. Since then, the fraternal friendship between Poland and the Soviet Union has been established and consolidated, and at the same time, Poland has also established friendly relations with all other people's democratic countries.

    The relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of Poland are determined by the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation, signed in 1945. When pointing out the great historical significance of this treaty, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, said that this treaty marked a fundamental shift in the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, towards alliance and friendship. Life has fully confirmed this (prolonged applause).

    Over the years, the relations between the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Poland have developed and consolidated, and our two countries have expanded cooperation in political, economic, cultural, and international affairs.

    These relations have had a favorable impact on the development of trade between our two countries on the basis of mutual benefit. Before the war, trade between Poland and the Soviet Union accounted for less than 1% of Poland's total trade, but in 1952, it rose to 32%. This year, trade between Poland and the Soviet Union will increase to more than eight times that of 1945.

    The continuous strengthening of the alliance and friendship between the People's Republic of Poland and other people's democratic countries has guaranteed, and will continue to guarantee, that People's Poland receives fraternal support in its development and steady progress towards socialism. The Soviet people have always been, and will continue to be, the loyal friends and reliable allies of the working people of the People's Republic of Poland and all people's democratic countries (stormy, prolonged applause).

    The people of our two countries, who are engaged in peaceful construction, are very concerned about defending and strengthening peace. We must not forget the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and we should be ready at any time to give the enemies of peace the due blows. People remember that the war that brought deep disasters to our country was caused by Nazi aggression, and that European peace was established because German imperialism was defeated and a camp of powerful peace-loving countries was established.

    The reactionary forces of capitalist countries are doing everything possible to hinder the easing of international tensions. They have established the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance, continue to expand their armaments madly, expand the network of American military bases in European and Asian countries, incite revanchist sentiments in West Germany, and pursue a policy of reviving German imperialism and rebuilding the German aggressive army.

    In this situation, the people of all countries should be particularly vigilant and should use their strength to prevent a new war that they hate so much. The whole world knows that the peaceful diplomatic policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening peace. Facts show that these efforts are not in vain.

    The people of all countries do not need war, and they have the strength to safeguard the cause of peace. This force is the ever-strengthening camp of peace-loving countries, and the camp of peace and democracy fighters in all countries.

    The unbreakable friendship and common aspirations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, and all people's democratic countries are the reliable pillar of the peace and democracy camp and the strong fortress of world peace (prolonged applause).

    Comrades! This year marks the tenth anniversary of Poland's liberation. In these ten years, People's Poland has traveled a great and glorious path. In these ten years, after the Polish people have taken control of their own destiny and established the regime of the working people, their country has undergone tremendous changes. The preparations for your congress and the progress of the congress provide convincing evidence that the Polish working people regard the Polish United Workers' Party as a wise leader and mentor, and that its ranks are united with the best and most advanced forces in the country. The Polish working people know that their achievements are due to the heroic struggle of the working class and the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    The trust of the people gives the Party special responsibilities. As the report of your Party Central Committee correctly emphasized, the enormous tasks facing the Polish people require the Polish United Workers' Party to unswervingly strive to further consolidate the unity of its ranks, and to improve the ideological level and political combat effectiveness of Party organizations.

    We all clearly see from the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in fifty years of struggle that if the Party takes Marxist-Leninist theory as a guide in its activities and creatively applies it to the specific environment in its own country, and if the Party constantly consolidates the steel-like unity of its ranks and relentlessly fights against all enemies of the people, the revolutionary party of the working class will be able to victoriously complete its historical tasks (applause).

    Historical experience tells us that the strength of the Party lies in its unbreakable ties with the people, and the strength of the people lies in their solid unity with the revolutionary party (applause).

    The Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party is undertaking significant work. It is summarizing the results of the implementation of the first four years of the Six-Year Plan and is formulating various measures to further develop the national economy, improve the welfare of the working people, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance which is the foundation of the people's democratic system, and further improve the combat effectiveness of the Party, which is the leading force in the struggle for the realization of socialism.

    This congress will undoubtedly be a significant milestone in the development of People's Poland on the road to socialist construction. I sincerely congratulate your congress on making outstanding achievements for the benefit of your people (stormy and prolonged applause. All rise).

    Dear comrades, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sent our delegation here, it instructed us to extend the following congratulations to your congress:

    "To the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union extends fraternal congratulations to the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party! (stormy and prolonged applause. All rise.)

    Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish working people have made tremendous achievements in the socialist industrialization of the country, the transformation of agriculture, and the development of culture. People's Poland has become a consolidated link in the powerful democratic camp and is an active fighter for safeguarding and consolidating world peace.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wishes the Polish United Workers' Party further victories in socialist construction, in developing Poland's agriculture, continuously improving the living standards of the working people, and consolidating the people's democratic state. (stormy and prolonged applause. All rise.)

    Long live the Polish United Workers' Party, the organizer and leader of the Polish people! (stormy and prolonged applause)

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples! (stormy and prolonged applause)

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"
      (Stormy and prolonged cheers. All rise. The whole audience cheers: Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!)
                  (Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Warsaw based on TASS)

### 在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上  尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话

    在波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会上
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话
    亲爱的同志们！在人民波兰的值得纪念的日子里，在波兰统一工人党举行第二次代表大会的时候，我谨代表苏联共产党以及全体苏联人民向你们，并通过你们向波兰统一工人党，向全体波兰人民致以衷心的、兄弟般的祝贺（暴风雨般的、历久不息的掌声，全体起立）。
    与我们友好的波兰的自由人民，正在波兰统一工人党的领导下，以英雄的劳动建设着新的、社会主义的生活。我们的党，苏联人民真诚地为你们在这条光荣的道路上所得到的每一个成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    波兰人民的成就使我们感到特别高兴，因为我们自己走过这条伟大的、社会主义的道路，而且根据我们自己的经验相信这是引导劳动人民走向自由和幸福、走向人民的一切生命力的蓬勃向上的唯一真实的道路。
    在争取新的社会制度的胜利、争取自社会和民族压迫下获得解放的斗争中，劳动人类是以战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说为指针的。
    波兰人民在工人阶级的领导下已经在一个短短的时期内，把经济落后的、资产阶级和地主的波兰变成了一个先进的人民民主国家。由人民自己管理的、为人民的利益服务的波兰人民共和国现在已有了高度发展的工业、迅速增长的国民经济和正在发展进步的文化。
    新的民主的波兰再也不像从前一样是外国资本剥削的对象、帝国主义国家的原料来源地和帝国主义者实行侵略计划、从事阴谋和挑衅的工具了。人民的波兰——一个重新统一在它的自然疆界内并巩固了它的民族独立的自由国家——始终不渝地奉行着和平与国际友好的政策，它是强大的民主阵营的坚固的一环。
    这个具有很大的历史重要性的事实激怒了那些惯于把原来的波兰当作一块肥肉的帝国主义强盗。
    波兰人民在建设社会主义的道路上取得的伟大成就使得苏联人民以及人民波兰的所有的忠实朋友们引以为荣。
    在你们的代表大会上所作的报告生动地描绘了波兰人民的斗争和胜利，描绘了以久经考验的领袖波·贝鲁特同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会和政府的活动（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）。
    波兰人民正在胜利地解决经济和文化发展方面的重大的、复杂的问题。波兰劳动人民已经完成了三年经济复兴计划，现在正在以爱国主义的热情执行六年计划（你们正确地称为国家工业化和奠定社会主义基础的计划）。
    在发展国民经济方面取得的成就是巨大的。一九五三年，波兰的工业总产量已增为一九三八年的三点六倍。工业中的社会主义成分已经取得了绝对的控制地位。共和国的农业在发展中。
    去年的国民收入已为一九三八年的两倍。个人收入已有显著增加，这说明劳动人民的物质条件比战前波兰已经大大改善。波兰人民是富有天才的，他们的科学、文学、艺术和文化也在前进。
    人民的政府、共产党和工人党都没有、也不可能有超乎人民利益之上的任何利益，它们所关心的莫过于人民的福利，莫过于满足人民的日益增长的物质和精神需要以及国家的繁荣。
    由于人民波兰在发展工业方面取得的成就，进一步发展农业已经有了必要条件。社会主义工业供给农业以越来越多的头等设备、肥料和制成品。工人阶级天天在给劳动农民以帮助。进一步发展国家的农业对于工人和农民都是有切身关系的。只有全面发展农业，不断提高劳动人民的福利才有保证。
    毫无疑问，在波兰统一工人党领导下的波兰人民在发展工业、大力发展农业和提高城乡劳动人民生活水平方面还会取得新的成就。
    工人阶级和农民的牢不可破的联盟是人民民主制度的基础和不可战胜的力量。苏联在社会主义建设中的丰富经验、你们国家以及其他人民民主国家建设社会主义基础的经验令人信服地说明：只有在社会中占压倒多数的工人阶级和农民结成坚固的联盟，新的社会制度的胜利才有可能。在我们的国家中，就是由于工人阶级和农民的联盟，剥削阶级才被铲除，工农才取得了政权，社会主义社会才建立起来的（掌声）。
    伟大的列宁教导我们，工农联盟是我们成功和我们最后胜利的保证。日常的生活证明了这个英明的列宁主义原则。波兰统一工人党在马克思列宁主义学说的指导下，正在加强工农联盟、巩固人民民主国家。
    你们的成就是不容置辩的，全世界的正直男女都看到了这些成就，各国的劳动人民都极为满意地为这种成就而欢呼。
    你们国家的工人、农民和知识分子经过英雄的斗争和忘我的劳动以后取得的成就说明，人民民主制度比资本主义制度有无比的优越性。人民民主制度中蕴藏着取之不尽的力量，可以促使工业和农业不间断地向前发展，可以提高劳动人民的物质与文化水平。工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子中的先进男女树立了杰出的榜样，让人们知道如何利用这些优越性和力量来巩固人民民主制度。
    社会主义的伟大的、蓬勃向上的力量在于它使各国人民团结一致，而不是使他们分裂。
    大家都知道，沙俄和贵族统治的旧波兰之间，有很长一个时期存在着很坏的、有时候是敌对的关系，这使得波兰、俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和立陶宛的人民同样受到痛苦。这是阻挠各国人民之间建立友好关系的统治阶级奉行反人民政策的结果。
    历史事实说明：波兰、俄罗斯、乌克兰和白俄罗斯的劳动人民一向有许多共同的利益。他们之间没有，也不可能有矛盾、憎恶和敌意（经久不息的掌声）。
    一九五四年，苏联各族人民庆祝一件值得纪念的历史事件：乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。乌克兰人民为摆脱波兰贵族的统治、取得独立而进行的斗争，曾得到辗转呻吟于波兰封建地主的压迫之下的波兰农民的热烈支持。
    在一六四八年到一六五四年的解放战争中，波格丹·赫米尔尼茨基的军队中有不少兵士是住在乌克兰的波兰农民。乌克兰人民的解放战争为波兰农民反对他们压迫者——地主和贵族——的武装斗争创造了有利的条件。赫米尔尼茨基很了解波兰农民的感情，他说，在即将来临的争取乌克兰独立的斗争中，波兰农民将帮助他。
    过去的事情提供了许多例子，说明俄罗斯、波兰和乌克兰进步人士之间有着私人友谊，这些人士根据各民族人民的共同利益，尽力在我们各民族之间建立友好关系。
    伟大的俄罗斯诗人亚·普希金和他的密友、伟大的波兰诗人亚·米茨凯维奇有着同样的看法。他们共同梦想着一个将来——“那时，各民族将忘掉他们的争吵，团结在一个大家庭中。”
    然而，波兰和俄罗斯最优秀的人们关于各民族友好和建立兄弟关系的梦想在很长一段时期中没有能够实现。地主、资产阶级制度为各民族友好造成的障碍太大了。
    伟大的乌克兰诗人塔·谢夫钦科在献给波兰革命家布·扎列斯基的诗篇中，称后者为他的朋友和兄弟，并且愤怒地写道，贪婪的波兰贵族和乌克兰地主在挑拨力求和平、友好相处的兄弟般的波兰人民和乌克兰人民之间的关系。
    波兰工人阶级从一形成起就和俄国工人阶级并肩作战，来反对共同的敌人——俄国的专制统治，反对资本家和地主。早在五十年以前，在俄国和波兰工人反对沙皇压迫，反对资本家和地主的斗争中，我们伟大的领袖乌·伊·列宁写道：“……我们永远将对波兰工人这样说：只有和俄国无产阶级结成最彻底的、最亲密的联盟才能满足目前既定的反对专制制度的政治斗争的要求；只有这样的联盟才能保证政治上和经济上的彻底解放。”（鼓掌）在俄国第一次革命的时候，列宁曾为英雄的波兰的英雄的无产阶级而欢呼。
    俄国和波兰劳动人民反对资产阶级和地主阶级政权的联合斗争，生动地表现于一个意义重大的事实，即：胜利的俄国革命的领袖之一，苏联人民称他为十月革命的英雄的费利克斯·捷尔任斯基是革命的工人阶级运动的杰出战士，是波兰人民的光荣儿子（经久不息的暴风般的掌声）。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，苏联政府立即宣布无条件地承认波兰的主权和独立。苏联政府领袖乌·伊·列宁指出，我们和波兰农民和工人们没有纠纷了，我们过去承认，现在仍然承认波兰的独立和波兰人民共和国。但是当时的反人民的波兰政府拒绝和苏俄建立友好关系。
    我们两国人民在反对共同的敌人——纳粹德国的联合斗争中，已建立了新的关系，即波苏之间的同盟和友谊。我们两国人民的友谊因为在这次斗争中所流的血而得到了永远的巩固（经久不息的暴风雨般的掌声）。
    十年前，当苏军会同波兰军队从德国法西斯侵略者占领下解放波兰领土的时候，就已为在波兰建立真正的人民政权创造了有利的条件。从那时以后，波兰和苏联之间的兄弟友谊就建立起来了并得到了巩固，同时，波兰和所有其他人民民主国家也建立了友好关系。
    苏联和波兰人民共和国之间的关系是一九四五年缔结的苏波友好互助与战后合作条约所决定的。列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林在指出这个条约的伟大的历史意义时说，这个条约标志着苏联和波兰的关系发生了根本的转变，走向了同盟和友好。生活已经完全证实了这一点（经久不息的掌声）。
    这些年来，苏联和人民民主的波兰之间的关系发展和巩固了，我们两国在政治、经济、文化和国际事务方面的合作扩大了。
    这些关系对于我们两国在互利基础上进行的贸易的发展产生了有利的影响。战前，波兰和苏联的贸易甚至占不到波兰贸易总额的百分之一，一九五二年，上升到百分之三十二。今年，波兰与苏联的贸易将增为一九四五年的八倍以上。
    波兰人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的联盟和友谊的不断加强已经保证，并将继续保证人民波兰在发展中、在向社会主义稳步前进中得到兄弟般的支持。苏联人民过去一向是、并且今后仍将是波兰人民共和国以及所有人民民主国家的劳动人民的忠实朋友和可靠同盟者（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    正在从事和平建设的我们两国的人民非常关心保卫和加强和平。我们不能忘记帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，应该随时准备给和平的敌人以应有的打击。人民都记得，给我们的国家带来深重灾难的战争是纳粹侵略所引起的，欧洲和平之所以能够建立是由于击败了德国帝国主义和建立了强大的爱好和平的国家的阵营。
    资本主义国家的反动势力正在尽一切力量阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。他们成立了侵略性的北大西洋联盟，继续疯狂地扩军，扩大美国在欧洲和亚洲国家内的军事基地网，煽动西德的复仇主义情绪，并奉行复活德国帝国主义和重建德国侵略军的政策。
    在这种情况下，各国人民应该特别警惕，应该用他们的力量去防止他们如此憎恨的新战争。整个世界知道，苏联和各人民民主国家的和平外交政策是以缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平为目的的。事实说明，这些努力并不是白费的。
    各国人民不需要战争，他们有能够维护和平事业的力量。这个力量就是日益加强的爱好和平的国家的阵营，就是各国和平民主战士的阵营。
    苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国以及所有人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊和共同的愿望是和平民主阵营的可靠支柱，是世界和平的强大堡垒（经久不息的掌声）。
    同志们！今年是波兰解放十周年。在这十年中，人民波兰走了一段伟大的，光荣的道路。波兰人民在掌握了他们自己的命运和建立了劳动人民的政权后，在这十年中使他们的国家发生了巨大的变化。你们的代表大会的筹备工作和代表大会的进行情况提供了令人信服的证据，证明波兰劳动人民把波兰统一工人党看作是英明的领导者和导师，它的队伍里团结着国内最优秀、最先进的力量。波兰劳动人民知道，他们之所以取得成就是由于工人阶级的英雄斗争，是由于波兰统一工人党的领导。
    人民的信任给了党以特殊的责任。正如你们党中央委员会的报告所正确地着重指出来的，波兰人民所面临的巨大任务，要求波兰统一工人党为进一步巩固它的队伍的团结，为提高党组织的思想水平和政治战斗力而坚持不渝地斗争。
    我们大家从苏联共产党五十年来斗争的丰富的经验中清楚地看到，如果党在它的活动中，以马克思列宁主义理论为指针，并且创造性地把它应用到它国内的具体环境中，如果党不断地巩固它的队伍的钢铁般的团结，无情地与人民的一切敌人进行斗争，工人阶级的革命政党是能胜利地完成它的历史任务的（掌声）。
    历史经验告诉我们，党的力量在于它和人民的牢不可破的联系，人民的力量在于他们和革命政党的巩固的团结一致（掌声）。
    波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会正在进行重大的工作。它正在总结六年计划头四年计划执行的结果，正在制订各种措施，以便进一步发展国民经济，改善劳动人民的福利，巩固作为人民民主制度基础的工农联盟，进一步提高争取实现社会主义的斗争的领导力量——党的战斗力。
    这次代表大会无疑地将是人民波兰在社会主义建设道路上发展的一个显著的里程碑。我衷心祝贺你们的代表大会为你们人民的利益作出成绩卓著的工作（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。全体起立）。
    亲爱的同志，苏联共产党中央委员会在派我们代表团来的时候，责成我们向你们代表大会致下面的贺词：
    “波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会：
    苏联共产党中央委员会向波兰统一工人党第二次代表大会致以兄弟般的祝贺！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。全体起立。）
    波兰劳动人民在波兰统一工人党领导下，在国家的社会主义工业化、在农业的改造和文化的发展方面取得了巨大的成就。人民波兰在强大的民主阵营中已成为巩固的一环，并且是维护和巩固世界和平的积极战士。
    苏联共产党中央委员会谨祝波兰统一工人党在社会主义建设中，在发展波兰的农业、不断地提高劳动人民的生活水平和巩固人民民主国家方面取得进一步的胜利。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声。全体起立。）
    波兰人民的组织者和领导者波兰统一工人党万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    波兰和苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！（暴风雨般经久不息的掌声）
    苏联共产党中央委员会”
      （暴风雨般经久不息的欢呼声。全体起立。全场欢呼：苏联共产党万岁！）
