    Commemorating the First Anniversary of Stalin's Death

    It is the first anniversary of the death of Stalin, Lenin's comrade-in-arms and the great successor to Lenin's cause, the revolutionary leader and teacher of the Soviet people and the working people of the world.

    Stalin, together with Lenin, established the powerful Soviet Communist Party, led the Great October Socialist Revolution, and created the first socialist country in the world. After Lenin's death, the Soviet Communist Party and Stalin inherited Lenin's cause, led the Soviet people to realize the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and built a brilliant socialist society. During World War II, the Soviet Communist Party and Stalin led the Soviet people to defeat Fascism, fundamentally changing the entire international situation. All the remarkable achievements made by the Soviet Union in the post-war period are also inseparable from Stalin's name. Stalin armed the Soviet Communist Party and the international communist movement with a great program for building communism in the Soviet Union.

    Stalin was the greatest thinker and theorist of our time. Stalin elaborated and developed the theories of Marx, Engels, and Lenin in detail, especially developing Lenin's theory on the uneven development of capitalism, the theory that socialism can first triumph in one country; he contributed to the theory of the general crisis of the capitalist system, the theory of building communism in the Soviet Union, the theory of the basic economic laws of modern capitalism and socialism, and the theory of national and colonial questions.

    Stalin defended and developed Lenin's theory on the Party in the struggle against various anti-Party elements and traitors. This is a contribution of great significance to the construction of the Soviet Communist Party and to the world communist movement.

    One of the extremely important principles of Lenin and Stalin's theory on the Party is to continuously strengthen the Party's unity. The invincible great strength of the Communist Party and the basic guarantee of revolutionary victory lies in its ideological unity and organized material unity created by Marxist-Leninist principles. The Soviet Communist Party, personally educated by Lenin and Stalin, is the most advanced, most experienced, and most theoretically cultivated party in the world. The reason why this party was, is, and will be our model in the future is that it is a fighting alliance of ideologically unified communists united by consistent viewpoints, unified actions, and unified discipline.

    The glorious example of the Soviet Communist Party proves that in order to protect the Party's unity, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against the opportunists in its own ranks. If the capitulationists, agents of imperialism, and traitors in one's own ranks are not crushed, one cannot preserve the unity and discipline of one's own ranks, one cannot fulfill its mission as the organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, and one cannot fulfill its mission as the builder of a socialist society. The history of the Soviet Communist Party is the history of struggling against and crushing the "Economists," Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Zinovievites, Bukharinites, and nationalist tendencies within the Party. The recent purge of the criminal Beria anti-Party and anti-Soviet clique is another great victory for the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people in the struggle to defend the Party's unity and defend the Soviet socialist system.

    The glorious example of the Soviet Communist Party teaches us that in order to ensure the consolidation and unity of the Party, and to ensure the correct leadership of the Party and the state, it is necessary to strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership. Collective leadership is the supreme principle of the Communist Party's leadership. The starting point of this principle is that only the collective experience and collective wisdom of the Central Committee, based on Marxist-Leninist theory and on the initiative and creativity of the leading cadres, can guarantee the correctness of the Party and state leadership, guarantee the unbreakable unity of the Party's ranks, and guarantee the victory of the Party's cause.

    The glorious example of the Soviet Communist Party also teaches us that criticism and self-criticism are of great significance for the consolidation and unity of the Party. Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism is the basic condition for the Party to develop, a special method of educating cadres, and a powerful weapon for exposing and eliminating errors and shortcomings in work. Communist Party members and leading cadres must bear in mind: do not be dizzy with success, do not be arrogant, and do not forget the humility and self-criticism that Communist Party members must possess. The conclusion of the "Short Course on the History of the CPSU(B)" states: "If the Party becomes proud because it is infatuated with victory, if the Party can no longer see the shortcomings in its work, if the Party is afraid to admit its mistakes, and afraid to correct these mistakes publicly and sincerely in a timely manner, then it cannot fulfill its mission as the leader of the working class. If the Party is not afraid of criticism and self-criticism, if the Party does not conceal the mistakes and shortcomings in its work, if the Party can educate and train cadres based on the examples of errors in the Party's work, and if the Party is good at correcting its mistakes in a timely manner, then it will be invincible."

    Our Chinese Communist Party takes the Soviet Communist Party as its model and is also established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. In the long revolutionary struggle, after all kinds of sacrifices and struggles, a unified leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the solidarity of the entire Party have been formed. The fundamental reason why our Party has been able to lead the Chinese people to complete the New Democratic Revolution, establish the People's Republic of China, and achieve great achievements in a series of social reforms and various construction works over the past four years is that it relies on the solid unity of the entire Party. Now, our country is in the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. We must gradually realize socialist industrialization, gradually realize the socialisttransformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and build our country into a great socialist country . It is a more profound and extensive revolution than the revolution against imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, and contains extremely complex and acute struggles. To accomplish such arduous historical tasks, we can only rely on the strong unity of the Party and the collective leadership of the Party. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Strengthening the Unity of the Party" proposed by the Central Political Bureau based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, which is of great historical significance for the Party's construction and the country's socialist construction. The implementation of this resolution will greatly improve the consciousness, vigilance, and combat effectiveness of the entire Party, so that the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation led by the Party today will move forward smoothly.

    Today, as we commemorate the first anniversary of Stalin's death, we should better study Lenin and Stalin's brilliant theories on Party building and the valuable experience of the Soviet Communist Party, especially the experience of strengthening Party unity and implementing collective leadership, conduct a serious study of the various documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC, and in the study, closely link our work and thinking to conduct inspections, strive to implement the "Resolution on Strengthening the Unity of the Party" of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC, and strive to gradually realize the Party's general line and build our country into a great socialist country.

### 纪念斯大林逝世一周年

    纪念斯大林逝世一周年
    列宁的战友和列宁事业的伟大继承者、苏联人民和全世界劳动人民的革命领袖和导师斯大林逝世一周年了。
    斯大林和列宁一起，建立了强大的苏联共产党，领导了伟大的十月社会主义革命，缔造了世界上第一个社会主义国家。在列宁逝世之后，苏联共产党和斯大林继承了列宁的事业，领导苏联人民实现了国家的社会主义工业化和农业集体化，建成了一个光辉灿烂的社会主义社会。在第二次世界大战中，苏联共产党和斯大林领导苏联人民战胜了法西斯主义，从根本上改变了整个国际形势。苏联在战后时期所取得的一切卓越成就也是和斯大林的名字分不开的，斯大林以在苏联建设共产主义的伟大的纲领武装了苏联共产党和国际共产党。
    斯大林是当代最伟大的思想家、理论家。斯大林详尽地论证了和发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁的学说，特别是发展了列宁关于资本主义发展不平衡规律的理论，关于社会主义可能在一个国家内首先胜利的理论；贡献了关于资本主义体系总危机的理论，关于在苏联建设共产主义的理论，关于现代资本主义和社会主义的基本经济法则的理论，关于民族和殖民地问题的理论。
    斯大林在与各种反党分子和叛徒的斗争中，捍卫了和发展了列宁关于党的学说。这是对苏联共产党的建设和对世界共产主义运动都具有非常重大的意义的贡献。
    列宁斯大林关于党的学说极其重要的原理之一，是不断地增强党的团结和统一。共产党的不可战胜的伟大力量和革命胜利的基本保证，就是在于它的由马克思列宁主义原则所造成的思想统一和有组织的物质统一。由列宁、斯大林亲手教养起来的苏联共产党，所以是世界上最先进的、最有经验的和最有理论修养的党，这个党所以在过去和现在是我们的模范，在将来也还是我们的模范，就在于它是由一致的观点、统一的行动和统一的纪律团结起来的思想一致的共产主义者的战斗联盟。
    苏联共产党的光辉榜样证明：为了保护党的团结和统一，必须与自己队伍中的机会主义分子作坚决的斗争。如果不把自己队伍中的投降主义者、帝国主义的代理人和叛徒加以粉碎，就不能保存自己队伍的统一和纪律，就不能实现其为无产阶级革命的组织者和领导者的使命，就不能实现其为社会主义社会建设者的使命。苏联共产党的历史，就是与党内“经济主义者”、孟什维克、托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子和民族主义倾向者作斗争并把他们粉碎的历史。不久以前贝利亚反党反苏的罪恶集团的被清除，乃是苏联共产党和苏联人民在保卫党的团结和统一、保卫苏联社会主义制度的斗争中又一个巨大的胜利。
    苏联共产党的光辉榜样教导我们：为了保证党的巩固与团结，为了保证党和国家的正确领导，必须最严格地遵守集体领导的原则。集体领导，这是共产党的领导的最高原则。这一原则的出发点是：只有以马克思列宁主义理论为基础并以领导骨干的积极性和创造性为依据的中央委员会的集体经验和集体智慧，才能够保证党和国家领导的正确性，才能够保证党的队伍的牢不可破的团结和统一，才能够保证党的事业的胜利。
    苏联共产党的光辉榜样还教导我们：批评与自我批评对于党的巩固与团结是具有非常重大意义的。布尔什维克的批评与自我批评，是党之所以能够发展的基本条件，是教育干部的一种特殊方法，是揭发和消灭工作中的错误与缺点的有力武器。共产党员和领导干部必须牢记在心的就是：不要因胜利而冲昏头脑，不要自高自大，不要忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神。“联共（布）党史简明教程”的结束语中说道：“如果党竟因迷恋于胜利而骄傲起来，如果党竟已看不见自己工作中的缺点，如果党竟害怕承认自己的错误，害怕及时来公开诚恳改正这些错误，那它就不能实现其为工人阶级领导者的使命。如果党不害怕批评和自我批评，如果党不去掩盖自己工作中的错误和缺点，如果党能根据党工作中错误的实例来教育和训练干部，如果党善于及时改正自己的错误，那它就会是不可战胜的。”
    我们中国共产党是以苏联共产党为榜样的，是同样以马克思列宁主义为基础而建立起来的。在长期的革命斗争中，经过种种牺牲奋斗，形成了以毛泽东同志为首的中央的统一领导和全党的团结
  一致。我们党所以能够领导中国人民完成了新民主主义革命，建立了中华人民共和国，并在四年多以来一系列的社会改革和各种建设工作中取得了巨大的成绩，其根本原因就是依靠全党的巩固的团结。现在，我们的国家正处于社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段，我们要逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。要完成这样艰巨的历史任务，只有依靠党的坚强团结，依靠党的集体领导。因此，中共四中全会一致通过了中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的建议提出的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，这对于党的建设和国家的社会主义建设都具有巨大的历史意义。这个决议的贯彻执行，必将大大地提高全党的觉悟性、警惕性和战斗力，而使党在今天领导的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业顺利向前发展。
    在今天我们纪念斯大林逝世一周年的时候，应当更好地学习列宁斯大林关于党的建设的光辉理论和苏联共产党的宝贵经验，特别是关于增强党的团结和实行集体领导的经验，把中共四中全会的各项文件，进行一次认真的学习，并在学习中密切联系自己的工作和思想进行检查，为贯彻执行中共四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”而斗争，为逐步实现党的总路线，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争。
