Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 22nd: According to the Korean Central News Agency on the 20th, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a decision on March 11th, approving the "1954 People's Economic Recovery and Development Plan," which is the starting point of the Three-Year Plan.

The decision stated: The Korean people, having achieved a historic victory in the Fatherland Liberation War against the American armed aggressors and their lackeys, have victoriously completed the 1953 plan for the prosperity and happiness of the motherland and the people, which was necessary for the comprehensive recovery and development of the people's economy, as well as for the work of consolidation. The completion of the 1953 plan has strengthened the economic foundation of the Republic and created conditions for further improving the material and cultural life of the people. These achievements, coupled with the enormous assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries, enable us to formulate a three-year plan for the recovery and development of the people's economy in the northern half of the Republic from 1954 to 1956, and to successfully complete this plan in order to restore all sectors of our people's economy to pre-war levels.

The decision stipulated that, firstly, in the industrial sector, the total value of industrial production in 1954 should increase to 160.4 percent of that in 1953. At the same time, the cost of state-owned industries will be significantly reduced compared to 1953. Among them, the tasks of the relevant provinces and bureaus of important industries are: the Ministry of Heavy Industry to reduce costs by more than 4.3 percent, the Ministry of Chemical and Building Materials Industry to reduce by more than 2.8 percent, the Ministry of Light Industry to reduce by more than 5.7 percent, the Electricity Bureau to reduce by more than 16.3 percent, the Forestry Bureau to reduce by more than 17 percent, and the Fisheries Bureau to reduce by more than 15.3 percent.

The decision also stipulated the scale of heavy industrial products. In order to meet the needs of the economic sectors and the people, the Ministry of Heavy Industry will mine a large amount of coal. In 1954, new drilling machines will be imported, and the efficiency of drilling machines will be further improved to primarily ensure the already determined coal production. In the metallurgical industry sector, the coking furnace of the Kim Chaek Iron Works will begin firing in November 1954. The ore dressing capacity of mines such as Geomdeok, Seongcheon, Hwapung, and Ryongun will be increased to more than twice their current capacity in 1954. In the machine-building industry sector, the machine-building factories and shipyards in various regions will be repaired first. In order to supply a large number of agricultural tools to agriculture, the equipment of agricultural tool factories and machine-building factories will be mobilized to ensure the timely production of agricultural tools. In the future, in order to guarantee the quantity and quality of agricultural tool production, agricultural tool manufacturing factories will be established. In order to supply more chemical fertilizers to the rural areas, the Ministry of Chemical and Building Materials Industry will start firing the nitriding furnace of the chemical fertilizer factory in September and produce a large amount of nitrogenous fertilizer in 1954. With the increasing demand for electricity, the Electricity Bureau will rationally utilize power transmission equipment, reduce the loss rate of power transmission lines to below 12 percent, and further strengthen the control of electricity supply to various institutions and residents.

In order to adapt to the large-scale construction and further expand the production of building materials, the Forestry Bureau will further expand the production of logs and expand the production of construction tools.

In order to rapidly develop the aquatic industry and supply the people with more aquatic products, the fishery output and fish processing will be further expanded in 1954. The Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Transportation will build large and small fishing boats.

In order to meet the people's needs for daily necessities, the Ministry of Light Industry will promote the construction of the Sinuiju Enamel Factory and ensure that production begins in the second quarter; promote the construction of the Pyongyang Cotton Textile Factory and complete the installation of 5,000 spindles and 500 looms in 1954; and repair the Kilju Pulp Factory to produce paper by the end of 1954.

The decision also stipulated important indicators for agricultural production, such as the sown area, grain harvest, cotton harvest, silkworm cocoon production, the number of cattle, sheep, and pigs, meat production, and the area of land cultivated by tractors.

In order to continue to expand the cultivated area, it is necessary to restore cultivated land in areas affected by bombing damage and disasters, build dikes, and protect cultivated land. At the same time, advanced farming methods should be widely adopted to further increase agricultural yields. The rice harvest should reach 103 percent of 1953, dryland grain should reach 143 percent, and soybeans should reach 109 percent. In order to meet the needs of the light industry sector for agricultural raw materials, the cultivation of cash crops should be encouraged and its sown area expanded. Cotton production should be increased to 182 percent of 1953, and tobacco to 213 percent. In addition, the production of oil crops, silkworm cocoons, vegetables, and livestock products should also be increased.

The decision also stipulated important indicators for the volume of railway, other vehicles, aviation, inland river, and maritime transportation in the transportation and postal and telecommunications sectors. In order to ensure the completion of the railway transportation plan, the Ministry of Transportation will repair main lines, station lines, damaged and destroyed railway bridges, etc., repair locomotive depots and vehicle inspection depots, and repair and renovate locomotives, freight cars, passenger cars, etc. in large quantities this year. It will actively promote the restoration and construction of railway repair factories in various regions. In order to ensure that the Yangdeok-Cheonseong electrified railway is opened to traffic in early 1955, the operation facilities must be completed this year. At the same time, special express trains and mixed trains will be operated between Pyongyang-Najin and Pyongyang-Sinuiju this year, and city buses will run in major cities; trucks and buses will be replenished, and automobile repair factories and gas stations will be repaired and newly built; cargo ships, passenger ships, and tugboats will be newly built; direct telegraph and telephone connections between Pyongyang and the locations of various provinces, as well as between the locations of provinces and the locations of counties, will be restored, and the city telephone network will be restored.

The decision also stipulated the task of increasing labor productivity, stipulating that labor productivity in the industrial sector in 1954 should be increased to 133.9 percent of that in 1953, the capital construction sector should be increased to 137.4 percent, and the transportation sector should be increased to 166 percent.

The decision also stipulated the retail commodity turnover of state-owned and cooperative organizations and the total state procurement volume in the commodity circulation sector and the state procurement sector. At the same time, in order to seek convenience in people's lives, 1,855 retail stores will be added in cities and 595 retail stores will be added in rural areas. In order to further improve the lives of workers and staff, the decision also stipulated the basic allocation amount for 1954.

Regarding the education, culture, and health sectors, the decision stipulated the number of students in primary schools, junior middle schools, and senior middle schools, the number of admissions and graduates from technical specialized schools and secondary schools, and the number of admissions to various universities in the 1954-1955 academic year. By the end of 1954, the number of cinemas will increase to 438, of which 302 will be added in cities and 136 will be added in rural areas; the number of theaters will increase to 11. The total number of various hospitals and their total number of beds, as well as the total number of outpatient clinics, will also be expanded. This year's pharmaceutical production will increase to more than 3.6 times that of 1953, of which household medicine production will increase to more than 9 times, and it will be widely supplied to the people.

The decision emphasized: In order to realize the people's economic plan for 1954, it is necessary to mobilize and utilize all domestic resources, including material, human, and financial resources, and strive to mobilize all the forces that can be mobilized by the entire people. In order to complete and overfulfill the plan, it is necessary to widely carry out the production increase competition movement. The decision called on the people of the whole country to unite and victoriously complete the people's economic plan for 1954, which is the starting point of the three-year plan for the comprehensive restoration and construction of the national economy, with patriotic labor.
