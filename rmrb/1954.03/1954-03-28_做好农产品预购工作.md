    The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council announced today an important decision to entrust cooperative societies in various regions with the pre-purchase of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil crops. This means that before and after the sowing of crops, cooperative societies in various regions, on the basis of farmers' voluntarism, will sign contracts on behalf of the state and farmers, pay a portion of the deposit in advance, and then the farmers will sell the agricultural products to the state after the harvest in accordance with the variety, quantity, quality, and time stipulated in the contract. This is an important policy during the state's transition period, and all rural party and government cadres and economic departments should seriously do this work well.
    Pre-purchase of agricultural products is an important measure to strengthen the planned nature of agricultural production and bring the small-scale peasant economy into the orbit of the state plan. Our country's economic construction is carried out in accordance with the law of proportional development. Therefore, not only industry, but also agriculture should be carried out in accordance with the state's plan. However, at present, the small-scale peasant economy still dominates in our country's rural areas. This small-scale peasant economy is scattered and backward, and its production is highly blind, often failing to produce according to the needs of national industrial construction and the people. The situation in recent years in which the sown area of various crops has varied greatly, sometimes more and sometimes less, is a clear example. The contradiction between the unplanned state of agricultural production and the planned production of socialist industry is becoming increasingly apparent with the progress of national industrialization. If this situation is not changed, it will affect the normal supply of people's needs and the normal progress of industrial production, thereby creating various chaotic phenomena in the national economic life.
    Transforming the small-scale peasant economy into collectivized agriculture is the basic way to solve this contradiction, but this is a long-term task. Adopting the pre-purchase contract system for agricultural products is a better method to solve this contradiction on the existing basis in our country. Because through the contractual relationship established with farmers, the state can influence and guide agricultural production in a planned way, and control and grasp the sown area and output of various crops to a certain extent. Therefore, this has a significant role in promoting the gradual inclusion of the small-scale peasant economy into the orbit of the state plan. Stalin once said in "On the Right Deviation in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)": "These new and universal forms of trade between cities and villages based on order-contract system... are a great step forward for our organizations in strengthening the planned socialist leadership of the national economy." This is an important explanation of the significance of pre-purchase contracts.
    Implementing the pre-purchase contract system for agricultural products has many direct benefits for the state and farmers. First of all, it can effectively expand the influence and position of the state-owned economy, that is, the socialist economy, in rural areas, and strengthen the state's leading role in the market price of agricultural products, allowing farmers to get rid of the exploitation of speculators. In the past, because the state did not implement a pre-purchase system, whenever farmers needed more investment to prepare for production in the spring, or needed some living funds when food was scarce, speculators often took the opportunity to appear in the form of high-interest loans to purchase green crops or lend cash; and after the autumn harvest, they used various methods to stir up trouble and compete to purchase grain and other crops, and then use them to exploit urban and rural residents. Now, the state stipulates fair and reasonable prices in advance and entrusts cooperative societies to sign pre-purchase contracts with farmers, which effectively打击了私人资本 (dǎ jī le sī rén zī běn, dealt a blow to private capital) in the rural market's behavior of disrupting the state's purchase plan and exploiting urban and rural people. And farmers can also be clear about the situation when sowing, and no longer worry about the sales after the harvest, so they can better arrange the production of the year.
    Secondly, after the state and farmers sign pre-purchase contracts, the state pays a portion of the deposit without interest burden to farmers in advance, and will gradually achieve planned or priority supply of means of production and means of livelihood to pre-purchase farmers, and provide technical guidance and assistance, etc. This also has a significant role in increasing farmers' production investment and stimulating the development of agricultural production. The pre-purchase situation of cotton in 1952 fully proves this point. For example, after Malu Township, Jiading County, Songjiang Special Zone, Jiangsu Province, signed a cotton pre-purchase contract with the state, it used the pre-paid deposit issued by the state to timely solve the difficulty of fertilizer shortage for 1,671 mu of land and seed shortage for 356 mu of land in the township. Another example is that more than 46,000 cotton farmers in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, signed a pre-purchase contract with the state and received a pre-paid deposit of 12 billion yuan from the state. This made it possible for them to increase production investment in all aspects and formulate cotton production increase plans. Most cotton farmers guaranteed a yield of 130 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field. And with the state's support and the expansion of agricultural production, the enthusiasm of farmers for mutual aid and cooperation has also gradually increased. Just as Stalin said in his speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in April 1929, pre-purchase, tractor stations, and rural cooperatives are all considered tools to promote agricultural collectivization. He said: "It is necessary to universally implement the order-contract system, establish agricultural machine stations, and develop cooperatives as much as possible, as a bridge for the transition of individual poor and middle peasant economies to collective public farms, making it easier for farmers to transfer their small individual economies to the track of collective labor."
    Again, after the implementation of the pre-purchase system, the state can grasp a part of agricultural products in advance, which also facilitates the planned arrangement of a series of issues such as the purchase price, plan, funds, and organization management of other agricultural products. On the one hand, it can avoid the busy and passive situation of the purchase work due to the large influx of agricultural products into the market after the harvest of crops, due to the urgency of time and the lack of coordination of various tasks. On the other hand, because the purchase work is planned and orderly, the state can better adjust manpower and funds to improve various supply work and strengthen various work related to improving agricultural production and improving farmers' lives.
    Pre-purchase of agricultural products is a new work and a heavy and arduous task. Party organizations, people's governments, and cooperative societies at all levels must treat it as an important political and economic task to complete. Thanks to the continuous education of farmers in recent years, especially after the vigorous publicity of the general line in the winter of last year, the political consciousness of the vast number of farmers has been improved, which is a favorable condition for signing pre-purchase contracts with farmers, but we must not be complacent about this when carrying out pre-purchase work. It is also necessary to continue to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity to farmers, explain the significance and methods of pre-purchase, and enlighten and educate farmers to voluntarily sign contracts, and strictly prevent the occurrence of coercion and command. When cooperative societies at all levels signed cotton pre-purchase contracts with farmers in 1951 and 1952, some areas had coercive and command phenomena such as "canceling membership if not pre-purchased," turning good things into bad things. This erroneous practice must be strictly prevented and thoroughly changed this year. Of course, in order to ensure the seriousness of the contract, it is also necessary to educate farmers to conscientiously fulfill the contract and ensure that the products are sold to the state according to the quantity, quality, and time stipulated in the contract.
    This year's pre-purchase targets for agricultural products should be mainly agricultural production cooperatives, perennial mutual aid groups, and temporary mutual aid groups, followed by individual poor and middle peasants. Based on this principle, when cooperative societies issue deposits, they should also effectively control the use of more organized farmers, more use of poor and disaster-stricken people, and less or no use of wealthy households, to prevent the tendency of average distribution and pure relief views. While paying deposits, it is also necessary to organize the supply of means of production and means of livelihood to farmers according to their needs. Only by doing a good job in the supply of means of production can we truly help improve agricultural production.
    To do a good job in pre-purchase work, it also requires party committees at all levels to strengthen leadership over this work, as well as the close cooperation and support of economic departments at all levels. Cooperative societies must put forward a systematic work plan including a series of work from preparation, publicity and mobilization, signing contracts, pre-paying deposits, supplying materials, to purchasing products, clearing contracts, and settling accounts, and carry out the work under the unified leadership and deployment of the local party organization and the financial committee. When the pre-purchase work is in progress, commercial, textile, agricultural, and foreign trade departments at all levels should strengthen contact, so that in determining pre-purchase, purchase plans, stipulating product purchase prices, allocating funds, and preparing supply materials, they can be implemented one by one in accordance with the spirit of the agreement.
    It must be recognized that the pre-purchase of agricultural products is not a temporary measure, but an important policy in the transition period. The quality of this year's work will be related to the future development of agricultural production and the smooth development of pre-purchase work. Therefore, we must strive to have a good start this year. We firmly believe that this year's pre-purchase task for agricultural products will surely achieve the expected victory with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of farmers and the efforts of all rural economic departments.

### 做好农产品预购工作

    做好农产品预购工作
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会今天公布了一项重要的决定，委托各地合作社对粮食、棉花、油料作物等主要农产品实行预购。这就是在农作物播种前后，在农民自愿的基础上，由各地合作社代表国家和农民订立合同，预付一部分定金，而后由农民按照合同规定的品种、数量、质量和时间，在收获后把农产品卖给国家。这是国家过渡时期的一项重要政策，全体农村党政干部和经济部门的干部，都应认真作好这项工作。
    农产品预购，是加强农业生产计划性、把小农经济纳入国家计划轨道的一项重要措施。我们国家的经济建设，是依照按比例发展的法则进行的。因此，不仅要求工业，而且也要求农业都应按照国家的计划进行生产。可是目前我国农村中还是小农经济占优势的，这种小农经济是分散和落后的，它的生产带着很大的盲目性，往往不能根据国家工业建设和人民的需要进行生产。几年来各种农作物播种面积此多彼少，忽多忽少，变化不定的情况，就是一个明显的例子。农业生产的无计划状态，和社会主义工业有计划生产之间的矛盾，随着国家工业化的进展而日益显露出来。这种状况如不加以改变，既影响对人民生活需要的正常供应，也影响工业生产的正常进行，从而造成国民经济生活中的种种混乱现象。
    改造小农经济使之成为集体化的农业，是解决这一矛盾的基本途径，但这是个较长期的工作。采取农产品的预购合同制，则是在我国现有基础上解决这个矛盾的一种较好方法。因为通过和农民建立的合同关系，国家可以有计划的影响和指导农业生产，在一定程度上控制和掌握各种农作物的播种面积和产量。因此，这对促进小农经济逐步纳入国家计划轨道，具有重大作用。斯大林在“论联共（布）党内的右倾”一文中曾说：“城市和乡村按定货合同制来实行交易的这些新的普遍形式，……正是我们的各个组织在加强对国民经济实行有计划的社会主义的领导方面的一个极大进步”。这就是对预购合同的意义的重要说明。
    实行农产品预购合同制，对国家和对农民还有很多直接的好处。首先，就是它可以有效地扩大国营经济、也即是社会主义经济在农村中的影响和阵地，并加强国家在农产品市场价格上的领导作用。使农民摆脱投机商人的剥削。过去，由于国家没有实行预购制度，每当春天农民为了准备生产需要较多投资的时候，或者青黄不接需要一部分生活资金的时候，投机商人往往就乘机用高利贷款的形式出现，收购青苗或借放现款；而当秋收以后，他们又用种种办法，兴风作浪，争购粮食及其它农作物，然后用以剥削城乡居民。现在由国家事先规定公平合理的价格，委托合作社和农民订立预购合同，这就有力地打击了私人资本在农村市场上破坏国家收购计划和剥削城乡人民的行为。而农民也可以在播种时就心中有数，不再耽心收获后销路好坏的问题，从而就能更好地安排一年的生产。
    其次，国家和农民订立预购合同后，向农民预付了一部分无利息负担的定金，还要逐渐地做到对预购农户有计划或优先供应生产资料和生活资料，并给予技术上的指导和帮助等等工作，这对增加农民的生产投资和刺激农业生产的发展也具有重大作用。一九五二年棉花预购情况就充分证明这点。例如江苏省松江专区嘉定县马陆乡和国家订立棉花预购合同后，用国家发放的预付定金，及时地解决了该乡一千六百七十一亩地缺肥及三百五十六亩地缺种困难。又如浙江省萧山县四万六千余户棉农和国家订立了预购合同，得到国家预付定金达一百二十亿元。使他们有可能从各方面增加生产投资，并订出棉花增产计划，大部分棉农都保证了每亩棉田产籽棉一百三十斤以上。而随着国家的扶助和农业生产的扩大，也逐步提高了农民互助合作的热情。正如斯大林在一九二九年四月联共（布）中央全会上的演说中，把预约采购、拖拉机站、农村合作社这三种东西，都认为是促进农业集体化的工具。他说：“必须普遍实行定货合同制，成立农业机器站，尽量发展合作社，作为个体贫农中农经济过渡到集体公共农庄的桥梁，使农民易于把他们的细小个体经济转到集体劳动轨道上来。”
    再次，实行预购制后，国家可以事先掌握一部分农产品，也就便于对其它农产品的收购价格、计划、资金、组织管理等一系列问题，进行有计划地安排。一方面，可以避免在农作物收获后，由于农产品大量涌进市场，因时间紧迫，各种工作未配合好而使收购工作陷入忙乱和被动局面。另一方面，由于收购工作有了计划和秩序，国家也就可以更好地调剂人力和资金，用以改进各项供应工作，加强对提高农业生产和改善农民生活有关的各项工作。
    农产品预购是一个新的工作，是一项繁重而艰巨的任务。各级党的组织、人民政府、合作社必须把它当成重要的政治和经济任务来完成。由于几年来对农民进行了不断的教育，特别是去年冬季大张旗鼓的宣传总路线以后，广大农民的政治觉悟都有所提高，这是和农民订立预购合同的有利条件，但在开展预购工作时决不能以此自满，还必须向农民继续进行广泛深入地宣传，讲清预购的意义和办法，启发和教育农民自愿的签订合同，严防强迫命令的发生。一九五一年和一九五二年各级合作社和农民订立棉花预购合同时，有些地区曾经发生“不预购即取消社员资格”等强迫命令现象，把好事办成坏事，这种错误的做法，今年必须严加防止，彻底改变的。当然，为保证合同的严肃性，也必须教育农民切实履行合同，保证按合同规定的数量、质量、时间，将产品卖给国家。
    今年农产品预购对象，应以农业生产合作社、常年互助组及临时互助组为主，其次为个体的贫农和中农。本此原则，合作社在发放定金时，也应切实掌握组织起来的农户多用，贫苦受灾者多用，富裕户少用或不用，防止平均分配和单纯救济观点偏向。在支付定金同时，还必须根据农民需要，组织供应农民的生产和生活资料。只有作好了生产资料供应工作，才能真正有助于提高农业生产。
    要作好预购工作，还要求各级党委加强对这一工作的领导，以及各级经济部门的密切配合与支持。合作社必须把包括从准备工作、宣传动员、签订合同、预付定金、供应物资，直到收购产品，清理合同、结算账目等一系列的工作提出系统的工作计划，并在当地党组织和财委的统一领导和布置下进行工作。在预购工作进行时，各级商业、纺织、农业、对外贸易等部门应加强联系，以便在确定预购、收购计划，规定产品收购价格、拨付资金、准备供应物资等方面，均能遵照协议规定的精神逐一加以实施。
    必须认识：农产品预购不是一项临时性的措施，而是过渡时期中的一项重要政策。今年这一工作作的好坏，将关系到今后农业生产发展和预购工作的能否顺利开展，因此我们必须争取今年要有一个良好的开端。我们深信，今年农产品预购任务在广大农民群众的热烈支持和全体农村经济部门干部的努力下，定将取得预期的胜利。
