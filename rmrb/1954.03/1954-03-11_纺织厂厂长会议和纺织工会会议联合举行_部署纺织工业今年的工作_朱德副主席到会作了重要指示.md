    Deploying This Year's Work in the Textile Industry
    Vice Chairman Zhu De Attended and Gave Important Instructions
    [By this newspaper] The National State-Owned Textile Factory Directors Meeting and the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union were jointly held in Beijing from February 15th to March 1st. Based on the general line of the state during the transition period and the current basic situation and problems of the textile industry, the meeting discussed the future direction and tasks of the textile industry, and focused on studying the work arrangements for 1954. Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

    The meeting examined and analyzed the current production situation and existing problems of state-owned textile enterprises. Based on this, it studied and determined the work arrangements for the textile industry in 1954: Focusing on continuing to strengthen planned management and implementing operating plans, further strengthen the leadership of technical work, promote advanced experiences, and carry out labor competitions; systematically establish and implement the factory director responsibility system and production area management system and related responsibility systems, continue to improve labor organization; vigorously cultivate cadres; strengthen financial cost management, gradually implement economic accounting system, and improve the level of enterprise management in order to achieve the goals of developing production, improving quality, practicing thrift, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity, to complete and overfulfill the 1954 national plan.

    In the discussion on determining this year's central task of strengthening planned management and implementing operating plans, the attendees clearly recognized that promoting operating plans is a central link in strengthening planned management, and is a basic scientific method for organizing the entire enterprise's production activities and exploring potential forces to ensure the balanced and comprehensive completion of the national plan. At the same time, they further clarified the content and scope of textile enterprise operating plans and their relationship with technical organization measures. The attending representatives unanimously agreed that focusing on the implementation of operating plans can promote the improvement and strengthening of production technology. The technical organization measures of enterprises must be for the purpose of ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan.

    In order to adapt to the requirements of improving the level of enterprise management, the meeting also discussed the implementation of the factory director responsibility system and production area management system in textile enterprises. The meeting believed that national state-owned textile enterprises should combine this year's central work, and in accordance with the principles of the factory director responsibility system and production area management system, systematically establish and implement the administrative responsibility system at all levels of factory directors, workshops, work sections, and production teams, and establish and improve the responsibility system of various functional organizations and other aspects of the responsibility system. At the same time, the organizational structure of factories should be adjusted accordingly, with special attention paid to enriching the strength at the grassroots level, especially strengthening the leadership at the production team level.

    The meeting discussed the further development of labor competitions, and clearly recognized that organizing competitions is a joint work of the trade union organization and the enterprise administration, and it is necessary to further strengthen the organization, leadership, and assistance and cooperation in labor competitions. Trade union organizations at all levels in the textile industry should assist the administration in improving enterprise management through labor competitions; administrative bodies at all levels should also assist trade unions in establishing a normal order for trade union work, and should systematically promote the collective contract system to advance the work of the entire enterprise.

    In the process of discussing various issues at the meeting, the comrades present all examined the arrogance and complacency existing among enterprise management cadres in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, laying a good ideological foundation for implementing this year's direction and tasks.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De attended the meeting and gave important instructions before the conclusion of the meeting. Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that the supply of textiles is a major event related to the relationship between the Party and the government and the people. It is necessary to actively develop the textile industry in accordance with the requirements of the national Five-Year Construction Plan to meet the growing needs of the people. Vice Chairman Zhu called on all employees of the textile industry to diligently and humbly learn political theory and business technology, learn from advanced Soviet experience, promote a modest style, strengthen unity, actively master all the advanced technologies of modern textile industry, and strive to complete and overfulfill the national plan under the guidance of the general line of the state during the transition period.

    Soviet experts Baichikolev and Kazansky gave special reports on the planning management of Soviet textile enterprises and the transformation of old factories, which greatly promoted the attendees' further study of the Soviet Union and rapid improvement of the management level of China's textile enterprises.

    The National Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union also specifically listened to reports from the trade union organizations of the State-Owned Qingdao Sixth Cotton Textile Factory and the State-Owned Shanghai Second Cotton Textile Factory on their experiences in organizing labor competitions and establishing a normal order for trade union work, and discussed the issue of strengthening grassroots trade union work. The plenary meeting unanimously passed a resolution: Organize all textile workers, engineering and technical personnel, and staff to sign competition guarantee conditions, further develop labor competitions, and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the 1954 national plan.

    朱德副主席到会作了重要指示
    【本报讯】全国国营纺织厂厂长会议和中国纺织工会全国委员会第二届第二次全体会议，于二月十五日至三月一日在北京联合举行。这次会议根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和纺织工业目前的基本情况与问题，讨论了纺织工业今后的方针任务，并着重研究了一九五四年的工作部署问题。朱德副主席到会作了重要指示。
    会议对国营纺织企业目前生产情况与存在的问题作了检查和分析，并在此基础上研究和确定了纺织工业一九五四年的工作部署：以继续加强计划管理、贯彻作业计划为中心，围绕这一中心，进一步加强技术工作的领导，推广先进经验，开展劳动竞赛；有步骤地建立与贯彻厂长负责制和生产区域管理制及其有关的责任制度，继续改善劳动组织；大力培养干部；加强财务成本管理，逐步贯彻经济核算制，把企业管理水平提高一步，以达到发展生产、提高质量、厉行节约、降低成本、提高劳动生产率的目的，完成和超额完成一九五四年国家计划。
    在确定今年度以加强计划管理贯彻作业计划为中心工作的讨论中，到会人员明确认识到推行作业计划是加强计划管理的一个中心环节，是组织整个企业生产活动和发掘潜在力量，保证均衡地全面完成国家计划的基本科学方法。同时进一步明确认识到纺织企业作业计划的内容和范围及其与技术组织措施的关系等问题。到会代表一致认为：以贯彻作业计划为中心，可以推动生产技术的改进和加强。企业的技术组织措施等工作，必须是为了保证完成和超额完成国家计划这一目的。
    为了适应提高企业管理水平的要求，会议又讨论了在纺织企业中实行厂长负责制和生产区域管理制的问题。会议认为：全国国营纺织企业应结合今年中心工作，根据厂长负责制及生产区域管理制的原则，有步骤地建立和贯彻厂长、工场、车间、生产小组的各级行政专责制，建立和健全各职能机构的责任制及其他方面的责任制度。同时，工厂组织机构应作相适应的调整，特别应注意充实基层力量，尤其是加强生产小组一级的领导。
    会议讨论了进一步开展劳动竞赛的问题，明确认识到组织竞赛是工会组织与企业行政的共同工作，必须进一步加强对劳动竞赛的组织领导与协助配合。纺织工会各级组织应通过劳动竞赛协助行政改进企业管理；各级行政也应协助工会建立工会工作的正常秩序，并应有计划地推行集体合同制，以推进整个企业的工作。
    在会议各项问题的讨论进程中，到会同志都本着批评与自我批评的精神，检查了存在于企业管理干部中的骄傲情绪和自满思想，为贯彻今年的方针任务打下了良好的思想基础。
    朱德副主席在会议结束以前曾到会作了重要指示。朱副主席指出：纺织品的供应，是关系党和政府与人民群众联系的一件大事，必须根据国家五年建设计划的要求，积极发展纺织工业，以满足人民群众日益增长的需要。朱副主席号召纺织工业的全体职工努力虚心学习政治理论和业务技术，学习苏联先进经验，提倡谦逊作风，加强团结，积极掌握现代纺织工业的一切先进技术，在国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，为完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗。
    苏联专家白契柯寥夫和卡赞斯基分别作了苏联纺织企业计划管理及老厂改造问题等专题报告，对到会人员进一步学习苏联、以迅速提高我国纺织企业的管理水平，起了很大的推动作用。
    中国纺织工会全国委员会全体会议还专门听取了国营青岛第六棉纺织厂和国营上海第二棉纺织厂的工会组织关于组织劳动竞赛、建立工会工作正常秩序的经验的报告，讨论了加强基层工会工作的问题。全体会议一致通过决议：组织全体纺织工人、工程技术人员、职员订好竞赛保证条件，进一步开展劳动竞赛，保证全面均衡地完成一九五四年国家计划。
