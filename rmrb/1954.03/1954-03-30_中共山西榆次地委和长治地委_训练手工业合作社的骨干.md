The CCP Yuci and Changzhi District Committees of Shanxi Province recently trained a group of backbone members for establishing handicraft production cooperatives and cadres to lead the operation of handicraft production cooperatives. The Yuci District trained 374 people, including 88 county and district cadres, and 286 backbone members from new and old cooperatives. In Changzhi District, 180 backbone members from 22 industries who would establish cooperatives and 30 cadres from county supply and marketing cooperatives and other units who would lead the operation of cooperatives participated in the training.

During the training period, the responsible cadres of these two district committees made reports on the Party's general line during the transition period and conveyed the spirit of the Shanxi Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Representative Conference. After studying policies and researching typical experiences, the trainees further recognized the position and role of handicraft production in the current national economic construction, as well as the necessity for handicraft workers to take the path of cooperation, and mastered the principles and methods of establishing cooperatives. Chen Lianbiao, a trainee cadre from Meng County, said, "This period of study has brought work enthusiasm. We must strive to run the handicraft production cooperatives well when we go back!"

    中共山西榆次地委和长治地委
    训练手工业合作社的骨干
    中共山西省榆次地委和长治地委最近先后训练了一批建立手工业生产合作社的骨干和领导办手工业生产合作社的干部。榆次专区训练了三百七十四人，其中有县、区干部八十八人，新社和老社的骨干二百八十六人。长治专区参加受训的有二十二个行业的建社骨干一百八十人，有领导办社的县供销合作社等单位的干部三十人。
    在训练期间，这两个地委的负责干部都作了关于党在过渡时期总路线的报告，并传达了山西省手工业生产合作代表会议的精神。受训的人员经过学习政策，研究典型经验，进一步认识了手工业生产在当前国家经济建设中的地位和作用以及手工业者走合作化道路的必要性，掌握了建社的原则和办法。盂县受训干部陈连彪等说：“这段学习带来了工作劲儿，回去要努力办好手工业生产合作社！”
