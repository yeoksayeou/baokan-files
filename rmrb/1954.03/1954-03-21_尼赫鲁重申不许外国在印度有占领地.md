Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 20th—According to TASS, Delhi, 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru reiterated during a speech in Parliament a few days ago that India is determined not to allow the existence of any foreign occupation on its territory.

    The Calcutta "Amrita Bazar Patrika" recently wrote: Since 1950, the United States has provided 360 million rupees in loans to French occupied territories for local governance, allowing the import of goods from the dollar area. These goods are being smuggled into India, disrupting the Indian market. The newspaper also pointed out: "French imperialists are using their occupied territories in India as bases for operations against Indochina."

    The newspaper pointed out that in Portuguese occupied Goa, although there are no American expatriates, the United States appointed a consul to Goa in August 1953.

    尼赫鲁重申不许外国在印度有占领地
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社德里十八日讯：印度总理尼赫鲁几天前在国会演说时重申，印度决心不许在它的领土上存在有任何外国的占领地。
    加尔各答“甘露市场报”最近写道：从一九五零年以来，美国给予法国占领地本地治理三亿六千万卢比的贷款以从美元区输入货物。这些货物被走私运到印度来，破坏了印度的市场。该报同时指出：“法国帝国主义者正利用他们在印度领土上的占领地作为对印度支那作战的基地。”
    该报指出，在葡萄牙占领地果阿，虽然一个美国侨民也没有，但美国却在一九五三年八月任命了一个驻果阿领事。
