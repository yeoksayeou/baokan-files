    Actively and Prudently Develop New Party Members Among Technical Workers and Technicians
    Song Cheng
    In order to make the Party's organizational construction adapt to the Party's current political tasks, Party organizations in state-owned factories and mines must pay attention to developing new Party members and establishing Party organizations among technical workers, model workers, and advanced workers in the important management and production departments of enterprises. The specific task of Party organizations in state-owned factories and mines in implementing the general line is to ensure and supervise that their respective units continuously unleash their potential and comprehensively and balancedly complete the state's production plans. After the recovery period of enterprises has ended, relying on improving business management, carrying out technical reforms, and continuously improving labor productivity and equipment utilization rates is necessary to unleash potential and complete state plans; at the same time, newly built factories and mines all adopt the most advanced technology and the most scientific management methods, and completing basic construction tasks especially requires improving our technical and management levels. To mobilize the broad masses of workers and staff to strive to improve management, we must strengthen the Party's political and ideological work and organizational work, and closely integrate political work with economic work. To this end, Communist Party members in state-owned factories and mines must study their professions, improve their skills, and at the same time strengthen political and ideological work among technical workers and technicians, and continuously recruit outstanding members among them into the Party to expand the Party's ranks. This is of great significance for strengthening the Party's leadership over factories and mines and realizing the Party organization's guarantee and supervision role over factories and mines.
    However, at present, many factory and mine Party organizations have not paid enough attention to recruiting new Party members from among technical workers in their work of developing new Party members, especially they have not paid attention to cultivating positive elements among old technical workers and recruiting outstanding members among them into the Party. Often there are situations such as: there are more Party members among administrative cadres in a factory, fewer Party members among workers, and even fewer Party members in some important workshops and important technical departments (such as planning sections, production technology sections); many factories' important workshops and important technical departments still have no Party members to this day. In some factories and mines, a portion of new Party members have been recruited, but their political enthusiasm has not been guided toward studying production technology, resulting in the so-called phenomenon of being "politically active but lagging behind in production." The existence of these situations makes the Party's organization not strong and powerful enough in guaranteeing and supervising production plans. The main reasons why these Party organizations neglect the work of developing new Party members among technical workers and technicians are that these Party workers do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of technical workers and technicians, and the shortcomings in their work resulting from this have not been overcome in a timely manner.
    Some comrades often criticize technical workers for having "purely technical viewpoints," "low political enthusiasm," "stubborn and conservative thinking," and "shortcomings in their lifestyle," etc. Or they see that some workers participated in reactionary parties, groups, and secret societies before liberation and have complex histories, so they are unwilling to approach them and do not patiently work with them.
    In reality, what is the situation of technical workers? It should be seen that after several years of education by the Party since liberation, many old technical workers have already possessed considerable political awareness. They actively study technology, improve their skills, and strive to do a good job in production, which plays an extremely important role in the country's industrial construction. The Party organization should vigorously support and promote this spirit. On the one hand, it should continue to improve the political awareness of these technical workers, and on the other hand, it should educate all workers to learn from them, so that everyone understands that they should dedicate their strength to the country's socialist industrialization and strive to study their professions and do a good job in production. However, some Party workers do exactly the opposite. They do not see the significant role of technical personnel in production, and they do not rely on them because they think technical workers are "politically backward," or even exclude them, making political work stagnate at general appeals. This urgently needs to be corrected. Of course, we do not deny that some old technical workers do have a tendency to not be concerned with politics, such as still having the idea that "with technology, you can go anywhere in the world." Even so, the Party organization should specifically analyze the reasons and take effective measures to improve their awareness. The reason why these old technical workers still have these erroneous ideas is that, on the one hand, these people are ideologically conservative and slow to accept new things; on the other hand, the Party's political and ideological education work is not deep enough to carry out patient education work aimed at the problems in their thinking. Among the old technical workers, there are quite a few people who participated in reactionary parties, groups, or secret societies. Among them, apart from a very small number who degenerated into pawns of the reactionaries, most people participated because they were threatened by the enemy or out of superstition. Because old technical workers lived in the old society for a long time, they would naturally be stained with some old ideological consciousness and styles. However, it is also because they suffered the deepest and heaviest pain that once their class consciousness is enlightened, they will become strong fighters in production and various struggles. Facts have also fully proved that many old technical workers have now gloriously joined the Communist Party, some have served as factory directors, workshop directors, and technicians in important positions, and many have become famous labor models, playing an inestimable role in the cause of national industrialization.
    In the past, many Party organizations did not have enough understanding of the importance of technical personnel in industrial construction. Last year, after strengthening planning management and technical management, everyone began to realize the importance of technical personnel and management personnel. Some units strengthened the education of technical personnel and paid attention to carrying out Party building work. However, some Party organizations still emphasized that technical personnel are ideologically backward and have complex histories, and relaxed the political education work of technical personnel; even though a group of outstanding members have emerged among technical personnel, the Party organization does not investigate and cultivate them, and recruit them into the Party. There was such a technical person who wrote application materials and autobiographies for joining the Party two or three times, but the Party organization adopted a bureaucratic attitude and did not pay attention to his request and discuss his Party membership issue. When he went to seek the opinions of the branch, the branch only said vaguely: "It must withstand the Party's test." Of course, at present, most technical personnel come from families of the exploiting classes, and they have been educated by the bourgeoisie for a long time, and their ideology and lifestyle are influenced by the bourgeoisie. The Party organization should recognize this. However, it must also be seen that the Party's policy of uniting and transforming technical personnel has achieved great success in recent years. Under the education of the Party, most technical personnel have made great progress, and many have gradually overcome the bourgeois viewpoints and styles and become advanced workers and labor models. After the general line study was launched in state-owned factories and mines, the socialist consciousness of many technical personnel was unprecedentedly high, and they were willing to dedicate themselves to the great cause of the socialist industrialization of the motherland. After studying the general line, the engineering and technical personnel of the Shipbuilding Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building were enthusiastic and strived to improve their work. Many people proposed "work hard to strive to be a red engineer," and 15 people expressed their desire to join the Party. This proves that carrying out the work of developing new Party members among technical personnel is not only necessary but also entirely possible. We must see the facts of changes and developments in recent years, and we can no longer use the past situation to measure technical personnel.
    The key to doing a good job in developing new Party members among technical workers and technical personnel lies is strengthening their political and ideological education. The ideological education of technical workers and technical personnel must be carried out according to their characteristics. When educating old technical workers, we should first find out the crux of their thinking, use various facts they are familiar with to carry out education, and gradually enlighten their class consciousness. At the same time, we should discuss production issues with them more, respect their opinions, support their various beneficial suggestions, and educate young workers to respect their masters and learn humbly. We should also take care of the old workers' difficulties in life as much as possible, so that they can feel the warmth of the Party in all aspects. For technical personnel, on the one hand, we must constantly help them criticize bourgeois viewpoints in technical issues and educate them to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union; on the other hand, we must often conduct education on communism and the Communist Party. Technical personnel have a higher reading ability, and Party organizations can organize and lead them to read documents themselves. For the positive elements that emerge in the work, special personnel should be responsible for investigating and educating them, and in the actual work assigned to them, constantly point out the specific direction of efforts, so that they can continuously improve and overcome their shortcomings.
    When recruiting technical workers and technical personnel into the Party, we must adhere to the standards of Party members and oppose any phenomenon of lowering the conditions for Party members. In individual units, there have been deviations in the past where only the good technology and active production of the Party applicant were considered, or only the performance of one time and one event was considered, while the political quality and communist ideological consciousness of the Party applicant were ignored. As a result, a small number of probationary Party members could not withstand the Party's test, and could not be formally approved after the probationary period, or were even finally disqualified as probationary Party members. Such development of new Party members is not good. Because a Communist Party member must play an exemplary role in the cause of national construction, if the newly recruited Party members do not have high ideological awareness, the due role of a Party member cannot be realized, and the Party organization's guarantee and supervision role in factories and mines will be affected.

    积极慎重地在技术工人和技术人员中进行发展新党员的工作
    宋　琤
    为了使党的组织建设适应党的当前政治任务，国营厂矿中的党组织必须注意在企业的重要管理部门、生产部门的技术工人、劳动模范和先进工作者中间发展新党员，建立党的组织。党组织在国营厂矿中贯彻总路线的具体任务就是保证和监督所在单位不断地发挥潜在能力，全面地均衡地完成国家的生产计划。当企业的恢复时期已经结束以后，要发挥潜在力量完成国家计划，必须依靠改进经营管理，进行技术改革，不断地提高劳动生产率和设备运用率；同时新建的工厂矿山，又都是采用最先进的技术和最科学的管理方法，要完成基本建设任务，尤其需要提高我们的技术水平和管理水平。为了动员广大职工群众努力改进管理就必须加强党的政治思想工作和组织工作，把政治工作和经济工作紧密结合起来。为此，在国营厂矿企业中的共产党员必须钻研业务，提高技术，同时又应加强技术工人和技术人员中的政治思想工作，并把他们中的优秀分子不断地接收到党内来，以扩大党的队伍。这对于加强党对厂矿企业的领导以及实现党组织对厂矿企业的保证监督作用是有重要意义的。
    但是，目前还有不少厂矿企业党组织在发展新党员工作中，还没有足够地重视在技术工人中接收新党员，特别是没有重视培养老技术工人中的积极分子并将其中的优秀分子接收入党。往往有这样的情况：一个工厂中，行政干部中的党员多，工人中的党员少，而一些重要车间，重要技术部门（如计划科、生产技术科）中的党员更少，不少工厂中的重要车间、重要技术部门至今还没有党员。有些厂矿中，接收了一部分新党员，但还未能将他们的政治热情引导到钻研生产技术方面去，发生了所谓“政治上积极，生产上落后”的现象。这些情况的存在，使党的组织在保证和监督生产计划方面就不够坚强有力。这些党组织忽视在技术工人和技术人员中进行发展新党员工作的主要原因在于这些党的工作人员对于技术工人和技术人员的认识还不够全面，不够正确，以及由此而来的工作中的缺点没有得到及时的克服。
    有些同志常常责备技术工人有“单纯技术观点”、“政治热情不高”、“思想顽固保守”、“生活作风上有缺点”等等。或者看见有些工人在解放前参加过反动党团和会道门，历史复杂，因而不愿接近他们，没有耐心地对他们进行工作。
    实际上，技术工人的情况是怎样的呢？应该看到，解放后经过党的几年的教育，很多老技术工人已经具有了相当的政治觉悟，他们积极钻研技术，改进业务，努力搞好生产，对国家的工业建设有极重要的作用。党的组织就应该大力支持和发扬这种精神。一面继续提高这些技术工人的政治觉悟，一面教育所有职工向他们学习，使大家都懂得为了国家的社会主义工业化而献出自己的力量，努力钻研业务，搞好生产。而有些党的工作人员却恰恰相反，他们看不到技术人员在生产上的重大作用，认为技术工人“政治落后”就不依靠他们，甚至排斥他们，使政治工作停留在一般号召上，这是急需纠正的。当然，我们并不否认，有些老技术工人确实存在着不问政治的倾向，比如还有着“有技术可以走遍天
  下”的思想。即是如此，党组织也应当具体分析其原因，采取有效的办法来提高其觉悟。这些老技术
  工人所以还有这些错误观念，一方面固然是这些人思想保守，接受新鲜事物较慢；另一方面也是党的政治思想教育工作还不深入，不能针对他们思想中的问题进行耐心的教育工作。在老技术工人中是有
  不少人参加过反动党团或会道门的，其中除了极少
  数堕落为反动派的爪牙外，多数人是因为受了敌人的威胁或出于迷信才参加的。老技术工人因为生活在旧社会的时间较长，自然地会沾染上一些旧的思想意识和作风。可是也因为他们受的痛苦最深最重，所以一经启发了他们的阶级觉悟，他们就会成为生产和各种斗争中的坚强战士。事实也已充分证明，现在已有许多老技术工人光荣地加入了共产党，有的担任了厂长、车间主任、技术员等重要职务，许多人成为著名的劳动模范，在国家工业化的事业中正发挥着不可估量的作用。
    对于技术人员在工业建设中的重要性，过去，许多党组织是认识不足的。去年，加强了计划管理和技术管理以后，大家开始认识到技术人员以及管理人员的重要，有些单位加强了对技术人员的教育，并注意进行建党工作。但是，有些党组织仍然强调技术人员思想落后，历史复杂，放松了对技术人员的政治教育工作；甚至技术人员中已涌现了一批优秀分子，但党组织不加以考察培养，接收其入党。就有这样一个技术人员，写了两三次申请入党的材料和自传，但党组织却采取了官僚主义态度，没有重视他的要求和讨论他的入党问题。他去征求支部的意见时，支部只笼统地说：“得经得起党的考验”。固然，在现在，大多数技术人员出身于剥削阶级家庭，他们长期受资产阶级教育，思想意识、生活作风都受了资产阶级的影响。党组织应该认识到这点。但是，也必须看到，几年来，党的团结改造技术人员的政策已经得到很大的胜利。大多数的技术人员在党的教育下，已经有了很大的进步，不少人已经逐步克服了资产阶级的观点与作风，并成为先进工作者和劳动模范。在国营厂矿中展开了总路线学习以后，很多技术人员的社会主义觉悟空前高涨，愿意献身于祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业。中央第一机械工业部船舶管理局的工程技术人员学习了总路线后，热情高涨，努力改进工作，很多人提出“努力工作争取做一个红色工程师”，并有十五个人表示争取入党。这就证明，在技术人员中进行发展新党员工作不仅是必要而且是完全有可能的。我们必须看到几年来的变化与发展的事实，而不能再拿过去的情况去衡量技术人员。
    做好在技术工人和技术人员中的发展新党员工作的关键在于加强对他们的政治思想教育。对技术工人和技术人员的思想教育必须针对他们的特点来进行。对老技术工人进行教育时，应该首先弄清他们的思想症结，引用他们熟悉的各种事实进行教育，逐渐地启发他们的阶级觉悟。同时，生产中的问题要多和他们商量，尊重他们的意见，支持他们的各种有益的建议，教育青年工人尊敬师傅虚心学习。对于老工人生活上的困难，也要尽可能的体贴照顾，使他们从各方面感觉到党的温暖。对于技术人员一方面要不断地帮助他们批判关于技术问题中的资产阶级观点，教育他们学习苏联的先进经验，一方面要经常对他们进行共产主义和共产党的教育。技术人员具有较高的阅读能力，党的组织可以多组织领导他们自己阅读文件。对于在工作中涌现出来的积极分子，应该有专人负责考察教育，在分配给他们的实际工作中，不断地指出具体的努力方向，使他们不断提高，克服自己的缺点。
    在接收技术工人和技术人员入党时，必须坚持党员标准，反对任何降低党员条件的现象。在个别单位曾经发生过只看入党者技术好，生产积极，或者只看一时一事的表现，而忽视了入党者的政治品质和共产主义的思想觉悟的偏向。结果有少数候补党员就经不起党的考验，候补期满了还不能转正，甚至终于被取消候补党员资格。这样的发展新党员是不好的。因为一个共产党员必须在国家建设事业中起模范带头作用，如果所接收的新党员思想觉悟不高，就无法实现一个党员应有的作用，党的组织在厂矿企业中的保证监督作用就会受到影响。
