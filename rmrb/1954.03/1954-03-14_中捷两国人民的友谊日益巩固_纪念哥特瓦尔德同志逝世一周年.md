    The Friendship Between the Chinese and Czech People is Growing Stronger
    ——Commemorating the First Anniversary of Comrade Gottwald's Death
    Wu Yuzhang, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    It has been a year since the death of Comrade Klement Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people, the outstanding fighter of the international working class communist movement, and the close friend of the Chinese people. Today, the working people of all countries commemorate the brilliant life of Comrade Gottwald with deep affection.
    As a student and comrade-in-arms of the great Lenin and Stalin, Comrade Gottwald dedicated his entire life to the cause of liberating the working people. He tirelessly fought for the Bolshevization of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, cultivating and training it to become a strong leading force for the Czechoslovak people in their struggle for freedom and liberation. The Czechoslovak Communist Party, headed by Comrade Gottwald, led the Czechoslovak people through many difficult years and severe trials. During the period of the bourgeois republic, all struggles against oppression and for democracy were inseparable from the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. During the dark years of the German Nazi occupation, in order to restore the independence of the motherland and get rid of the cruel tyranny of the fascist occupiers, the Czechoslovak Communist Party led the heroic national liberation struggle unyieldingly. The Czechoslovak people persevered in their struggle, and with the decisive assistance of the Soviet army, finally won the victory of the national and democratic revolution.
    Comrade Gottwald was the founder of the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia. The victorious Czechoslovak people consolidated the people's democratic system, established the solid unity of all ethnic groups in Czechoslovakia, strengthened the power of the People's Republic, and opened up a broad road for building socialism. Under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Czechoslovak working people waged a serious struggle against the rebellious reactionaries in February 1948, and smashed the international reactionaries' conspiracy to make Czechoslovakia return to the capitalist road. In December 1951, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people exposed the traitorous group headed by Slánský and purged the bandits who attempted to disintegrate the Communist Party from within, which was of great significance for defending the victorious achievements of the people's revolution.
    Under the leadership of Comrade Gottwald, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak people rapidly restored the national economy and began to implement the first Five-Year Plan in 1949 in order to build the material and technical foundation of socialism and fundamentally change the face of the country and the lives of the people. The Czechoslovak people of all ethnic groups displayed a high degree of conscious labor enthusiasm and achieved significant achievements in the great cause of building a happy socialist society.
    The death of Comrade Gottwald caused immeasurable losses to the Czechoslovak people. However, the Czechoslovak people are more firmly united around the Central Committee and government of their Communist Party, strengthening the fraternal friendship with socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and continuing to advance on the road of further consolidating the people's democratic regime and completing socialist construction.
    In 1953, the Czechoslovak people victoriously completed the first Five-Year Plan. The completion of this plan enabled Czechoslovakia to get rid of its dependence on the capitalist world and take a major step forward on the road of socialist construction. Now, all sectors of the Czechoslovak national economy, except for the agricultural sector, have completely eliminated capitalist elements, and the socialist components in agriculture have also been greatly consolidated and developed. The vast majority of the means of production have been transferred to social ownership, a factor that is playing an increasingly important role in the continued development of the national economy and the further construction of socialism by the Czechoslovak people.
    The completion of the first Five-Year Plan resulted in a significant increase in industrial production. In 1953, Czechoslovakia's industrial production increased by more than double compared to 1948, equivalent to 2.25 times the highest pre-war level. The total value of industrial production accounted for 80 percent of the gross national income, and the production of the means of production accounted for 62 percent of the total industrial production. Czechoslovakia's steel production reached 4.3 million tons in 1953, coal production reached 54.6 million tons, electricity was 12.5 billion kilowatt-hours, and the machinery manufacturing industry increased by two and a half times compared to 1948. The rapid surge in industrial production and the increase in the proportion of means of production have made Czechoslovakia a modern industrial country with a strong heavy industrial base.
    While industry has achieved significant development, tremendous changes have also taken place in Czechoslovakia's agriculture. The implementation of the Five-Year Plan resulted in an increase in agricultural production by more than one-third. Fifty-eight percent of the countryside established unified agricultural cooperatives, agricultural labor was highly mechanized, and state-owned farms were further improved at a high level of production. Socialist agricultural large-scale production of state-owned farms and unified agricultural cooperatives owned 48 percent of all arable land. Czechoslovakia's agriculture is continuing to advance on the road of socialist transformation.
    Other sectors of the national economy have also made great progress. Socialist trade is making great efforts to meet the people's demand for consumer goods. In 1953, Czechoslovakia also implemented currency reform, thereby making the crown a stable currency and continuously increasing the people's purchasing power. In 1953, the rationing system was also abolished, and unified retail prices for consumer goods were implemented, and retail prices for consumer goods were reduced twice. This all demonstrates the consolidation of Czechoslovakia's economic strength and the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government's concern for the welfare of the working people.
    Now, on the basis of the completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the Czechoslovak people are continuing to work hard to further develop the national economy.
    The strong development of the Czechoslovak Republic under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party has greatly strengthened the power of the peaceful democratic socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of all countries striving for peace. The Czechoslovak Communist Party and government firmly follow the direction indicated by Comrade Gottwald, and consistently strive to maintain peace, consolidate peace, and strengthen friendly cooperation with all peace-loving countries. President Zapotocky said in his New Year's broadcast to the nation on January 1 this year: "We have always supported and will continue to support the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace. We firmly believe that a clear and unwavering peace policy is the most effective weapon to smash the war conspiracies of the world's imperialist aggressive blocs and the most correct policy to defend the happiness and prosperity of our people." Loyal to Comrade Gottwald, the Czechoslovak people, due to their achievements in building socialism and strengthening national defense, due to their loyal friendship with the Soviet Union, due to their continuous strengthening of close relations with China and other people's democratic countries and striving to ease international tensions, have made important contributions to maintaining and consolidating the cause of peace. Peace-loving people in all countries believe that the Czechoslovak Republic is an important force for defending peace, and are extremely excited about its strong development and achievements.
    Our people have deep and loving feelings for Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak people. Comrade Gottwald's sympathy and support for the revolutionary cause of our people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, as well as his concern for the development of friendship between the Chinese and Czech people after the victory of our revolution, will never be forgotten by our people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the relations between China and Czechoslovakia have become increasingly close within the peaceful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and trade agreements, cultural cooperation agreements, scientific and technological cooperation agreements and other agreements have been signed successively, thereby strengthening the mutual assistance relationship of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries. The people of the two countries have also continuously sent various delegations to visit each other, which has played a great role in promoting the friendship between the two peoples. This increasingly close relationship between the Chinese and Czech people is unprecedented in history, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in his message of condolence to the Presidium of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic on March 15 last year: "I am deeply convinced that in the cause of further consolidating and developing the close unity and friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Czech people, and further strengthening the world peace and democracy camp headed by our common ally - the great Soviet Union, Comrade Gottwald's brilliant contributions will forever inspire the Chinese and Czech people to advance bravely and victoriously." On this day of commemorating the first anniversary of Comrade Gottwald's death, let us continue to strive to develop the close friendship between the Chinese and Czech people, consolidate and develop the strong unity of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strive for new victories in the cause of defending world peace!

    中捷两国人民的友谊日益巩固
    ——纪念哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年
    中国共产党中央委员  吴玉章
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民的伟大领袖、国际工人阶级共产主义运动的卓越战士、中国人民的亲密朋友克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年了。今天，各国劳动人民都怀着亲切的心情来纪念哥特瓦尔德同志的光辉的一生。
    作为伟大的列宁和斯大林的学生和战友，哥特瓦尔德同志把自己的整个生命都献给了劳动人民的解放事业。他曾不倦地为捷克斯洛伐克共产党的布尔什维克化而斗争，把它培养和锻炼成为捷克斯洛伐克人民争取自由解放的坚强的领导力量。以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党，领导捷克斯洛伐克人民度过了许多艰苦的年代和严重的考验。在资产阶级共和国时期，一切反对压迫、争取民主的斗争，都是和捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导分不开的。在希特勒德国占领的黑暗岁月里，为了恢复祖国的独立，摆脱法西斯占领者的残酷暴政，捷克斯洛伐克共产党又不屈不挠地领导了英勇的民族解放斗争。捷克斯洛伐克人民坚持的斗争，在苏联军队的决定性的援助下，终于赢得了民族和民主革命的胜利。
    哥特瓦尔德同志是人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国的缔造者。胜利了的捷克斯洛伐克人民，巩固了人民民主制度，建立了捷克斯洛伐克各族人民的坚固团结，加强了人民共和国的力量，开辟了建设社会主义的广阔道路。在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民于一九四八年二月对谋叛的反动派进行了严重的斗争，粉碎了国际反动派想使捷克斯洛伐克重新走上资本主义道路的阴谋。一九五一年十二月，捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民，揭发了以斯兰斯基为首的叛国集团，把企图瓦解共产党的匪徒从党内清洗出去，这对于保卫人民革命的胜利果实，具有重大的意义。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在哥特瓦尔德同志的领导下，在苏联的无私的援助下，迅速恢复了国民经济，于一九四九年开始实行第一个五年计划，以建设社会主义的物质和技术基础，来根本改变国家的面貌和人民的生活状况。捷克斯洛伐克各族人民发挥了高度的自觉的劳动热忱，在建成幸福的社会主义社会的伟大事业中取得了重大的成就。
    哥特瓦尔德同志的逝世使捷克斯洛伐克人民遭遇到无可估量的损失。但是，捷克斯洛伐克人民更加坚定地团结在自己的共产党中央委员会和政府的周围，加强着和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的兄弟友谊，在进一步巩固人民民主政权和完成社会主义建设的道路上继续前进。
    一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克人民胜利地完成了第一个五年计划。这个计划的完成使捷克斯洛伐克摆脱了对资本主义世界的依赖，在社会主义建设的道路上前进了一大步。现在，捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的各部门，除农业部门外，已彻底消灭了资本主义因素，而农业中的社会主义的成分也大大地巩固和发展起来了。绝大多数的生产资料已转为社会所有，这一个因素，对于捷克斯洛伐克人民继续发展国民经济并进一步建成社会主义发生着日益重大的作用。
    第一个五年计划的完成，使工业生产获得了显著的增长。一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克的工业生产量比一九四八年增加了一倍以上，等于战前最高水平的二点二五倍。工业生产总值在国民总收入中已占百分之八十，生产资料的生产在全部工业生产中已占百分之六十二。捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量在一九五三年已达到四百三十万吨，煤产量已达到五千四百六十万吨，电力为一百二十五亿瓩时，机器制造业比一九四八年增加了两倍半。工业生产的迅速高涨和生产资料生产比重的增长，使捷克斯洛伐克已成为一个具有强大重工业基础的现代工业国家。
    在工业获得重大发展的同时，捷克斯洛伐克的农业也发生了巨大的变化。五年计划执行的结果使农业生产提高了三分之一强。百分之五十八的农村建立了统一农业合作社，农业劳动高度机械化了，国营农场在高度的生产水平上进一步改善了。国营农场和统一农业合作社的社会主义农业大生产，已拥有占全部可耕地的百分之四十八的土地。捷克斯洛伐克的农业正在向着社会主义改造的道路继续前进。
    国民经济的其他部门也有了很大的进步。社会主义的贸易以巨大的努力来满足人民对于消费品的要求。一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克并实行了币制改革，从而使克朗成为稳定的货币，并使人民购买力得到不断的提高。一九五三年还废除了配给制，实行了统一的消费品零售价格，并两次减低了消费品零售价格。这都说明了捷克斯洛伐克经济力量的巩固，和捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府对劳动人民福利的关怀。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克人民正在第一个五年计划完成的基础上，继续为进一步发展国民经济而努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下的强大发展，大大加强了以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量和各国人民争取和平的力量。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府坚决遵循着哥特瓦尔德同志所指示的方向，一贯地为维护和平、巩固和平、加强与一切爱好和平国家的友好合作而奋斗。萨波托斯基总统在今年一月一日向全国人民发表的新年广播演说中说道：“我们一贯支持，将来还要支持苏联为争取和平的努力。我们完全相信，目标明确的、始终不渝的和平政策是粉碎世界帝国主义侵略集团战争阴谋的最有效的武器，是保卫我国人民幸福和繁荣的最正确的政策。”忠实于哥特瓦尔德同志的捷克斯洛伐克人民由于他们建设社会主义和加强国防力量的成就，由于他们对苏联的忠诚友谊，由于他们不断加强与中国及各人民民主国家的亲密关系并为争取缓和国际紧张局势而努力，从而对维护和巩固和平的事业作出了重要的贡献。各国爱好和平的人民都认为捷克斯洛伐克共和国是保卫和平的重要力量，并对它的强大发展和成就感到极大的兴奋。
    我国人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民的伟大领袖哥特瓦尔德同志怀着深刻的、敬爱的感情。哥特瓦尔德同志对我国人民在共产党和毛泽东同志领导下所进行的革命事业的同情和支持，以及在我国革命取得胜利后对发展中捷两国人民友谊所表现的关怀，是我国人民永远不能忘记的。中华人民共和国成立以后，中捷两国在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营内关系日益亲密，并先后签订了贸易协定、文化合作协定、科学与技术合作协定以及其他协定，从而加强了两国间的经济与文化合作的互助关系。两国人民并不断派遣各种代表团，互相访问，对促进两国人民友谊起了很大的作用。中捷两国人民这种日益亲密的关系，是历史上所未曾有过的，正如毛泽东同志于去年三月十五日在给捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府主席团的唁电中所说：“我深信：在进一步巩固和发展中捷两国人民的亲密团结和友好合作，进一步增强以我们的共同盟邦——伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的事业中，哥特瓦尔德同志的辉煌贡献将永远鼓舞着中捷两国人民奋勇地胜利地前进”。在纪念哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年的这个日子中，让我们继续为发展中捷两国人民的亲密友谊、巩固与发展以苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义阵营的强大团结，争取保卫世界和平事业的新胜利而努力吧！
