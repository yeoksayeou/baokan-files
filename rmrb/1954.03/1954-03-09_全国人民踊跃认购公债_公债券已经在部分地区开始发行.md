Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: People across the country are subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. The promotion of these public bonds has started in major cities first. In rural areas, because farmers have been busy selling surplus grain in recent months, the promotion will not begin universally in most areas until March, except in the Northeast and parts of North China where promotion has already begun. Workers and staff in factories and mines, government cadres, cultural, educational, and medical workers, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are taking the lead in subscribing. Many people enthusiastically subscribed even before the promotion work began. Therefore, the progress has been rapid in areas where promotion has already started. According to statistics up to February 24th (Shanghai up to February 27th), the total subscription amount nationwide has reached more than 2.3 trillion yuan; by the end of February, payments had reached 673.3 billion yuan. Among the fourteen municipalities directly under the central government, the subscription phase has ended or basically ended in eleven major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Fushun, Benxi, Lushun-Dalian, Changchun, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an, with subscription amounts exceeding the planned targets. The promotion work started later in Shanghai, Anshan, and Guangzhou, and the people are now enthusiastically purchasing.

In recent years, due to the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, the living standards of people from all walks of life have continuously improved. Since October of last year, the people across the country have also been educated on the general line of the state during the transition period, and patriotic enthusiasm is overflowing. Everyone is willing to contribute more to the country's socialist construction.

Everyone considers it the greatest honor to invest their surplus money in the country's industrial construction. Therefore, when the promotion work started in various places, people from all walks of life subscribed enthusiastically. In the capital, Beijing, the total amount purchased from January 13th to the end of January exceeded the planned target by 52.27 percent. Cities like Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Xi'an all ended the promotion work in less than a month. Cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army regard subscribing to public bonds as a duty and a glorious right. They said: In the past, we were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice to fight the enemy in order to realize socialism. Now, the time has come to directly support the country's construction of socialism. We should add a brick and a tile to the country's construction. Although the soldiers have less income, they feel that they have fulfilled their wishes by purchasing public bonds, and they have also subscribed with their savings. According to incomplete statistics, the total subscription amount of the entire army exceeded the planned target by 173 percent. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers deeply understand the significance of industrial development for national defense and are especially concerned about and strive to support the construction of the motherland. The entire army exceeded the planned subscription amount by 345.67 percent and ended the subscription phase. In recent years, private industrial and commercial enterprises have developed their production and gained profits with the support of the state. Therefore, many industrialists and businessmen have been active in purchasing public bonds.

In the promotion of public bonds, all localities have paid attention to adhering to the principles of voluntary participation within one's capacity and without affecting one's livelihood. The amount subscribed by the vast majority of subscribers is only a small part of their income or savings. For example, the total amount subscribed by farmers in Guo Hou Banner, Heilongjiang Province, is less than 3 percent of their income from sideline occupations and sales of surplus grain in 1953.

Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds have begun to be issued in some areas. In late February, the People's Bank of China transported the first batch of printed public bonds to the Military Bank and entrusted the Military Bank to issue them to the Chinese People's Volunteers, which has now fully met their needs. At the end of February and the beginning of March, the People's Bank of China transported a large number of public bonds to remote areas such as the Northwest, Southwest, Northeast provinces, and Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, etc., respectively, and they can be transported to these areas successively in early and mid-March. The public bonds needed by the provinces in North China, East China, Central South China, and major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou will be allocated successively in mid-March. It is expected that public bonds will be universally issued throughout the country in early or mid-April.

According to Article 4 of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations, the face values of these public bonds are divided into five types: 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan. These five denominations of public bonds will be issued simultaneously. In terms of issuance order, the People's Bank of China is prepared to first meet the needs of bond purchasers who are dispersed in residence, large in number, and highly mobile, but at the latest in April, they can be generally issued to all subscribers.

At present, people from all walks of life have successively paid public bond payments to the People's Bank of China in various places. The People's Bank of China in various places has issued temporary receipts to payers. When the public bonds are transported and begin to be issued in the future, payers can exchange the temporary receipts for public bonds from the bank that originally issued the receipts.

    全国人民踊跃认购公债
    公债券已经在部分地区开始发行
    【新华社八日讯】全国各地人民正在认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债。这次推销公债的工作，首先从大城市开始。农村因这几个月来农民忙着出卖余粮，除东北区和华北部分地区已开始推销外，大部分地区要在三月份才普遍开始。各地工矿职工、机关干部、文教医务工作者、中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的指战员都首先带头认购，许多人在推销工作开始前就热烈认购，因此，凡在已经开始推销的地区，进展都很迅速。据到二月二十四日止（上海到二十七日止）的统计，全国认购数已达二万三千多亿元；到二月底，缴款已达六千七百三十三亿元。全国十四个直辖市中，北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、抚顺、本溪、旅大、长春、武汉、重庆、西安等十一个大城市各界人民认购公债阶段已经结束或基本结束，认购额都超过了预计额：上海、鞍山、广州三市推销工作开始较晚，人民现正在踊跃购买。
    几年来，由于国民经济的迅速恢复发展，各界人民的生活不断上升。从去年十月起，全国人民又受到国家过渡时期总路线的教育，爱国主义的热情洋溢，都愿意在国家的社会主义建设事业中多贡献一分力量。
    人人都以能把自己的余钱投入祖国工业建设中看作最大光荣。因此，当各地一开始推销工作，各界人民认购就十分踊跃，首都人民从一月十三日开始，到一月底所购买的总数就超过预计数百分之五十二点二七。天津、沈阳、重庆、西安等城市都不到一个月就结束了推销工作。中国人民解放军的干部和战士把认购公债当作应尽的义务和光荣的权利。他们说：过去不怕流血牺牲和敌人作战，就是为了实现社会主义，现在直接支援国家建设社会主义的时候到了，我们应为国家建设加上一砖一瓦。战士们虽然收入较少，都觉得购买了公债才尽了自己的心愿，也纷纷以平日的积蓄认购。全军认购数，据不完全统计，超过预计数百分之一百七十三。中国人民志愿军的指战员们深深体会到工业发展对于国防的意义，格外惦记并努力支援祖国的建设。全军超过预计认购数百分之三百四十五点六七，结束了认购阶段。私营工商业这几年来在国家扶助下，生产得到发展，获得了利润，因此有不少工商业者在购买公债中表现得积极。
    各地在推销公债中，都注意掌握自愿量力、不影响生活的原则。绝大部分认购者所认购的数额只是他的收入或积蓄的一小部分。如黑龙江省郭后旗农民认购的总数还不到他们一九五三年副业和出卖余粮两项收入的百分之三。
    【新华社八日讯】一九五四年国家经济建设公债券开始在部分地区发行。二月下旬，中国人民银行把第一批印好的公债券运到随军银行，并委托随军银行向中国人民志愿军发行，现在已完全满足了他们的需要。二月底和三月初，人民银行又把大批公债券分别运送到西北、西南、东北各省和广西、内蒙古等边远地区去，三月上旬和中旬就可以先后运到。华北、华东、中南各省及北京、上海、天津、武汉、广州等大城市所需要的公债券，将在三月中旬陆续拨发。预计四月上旬或中旬公债券将在全国各地普遍发行。
    根据一九五四年国家经济建设公债条例第四条规定，本公债券面额分为壹万元、贰万元、伍万元、拾万元、伍拾万元五种。这五种面额的公债券将同时发行。在发行次序上，人民银行准备首先满足居住分散、人数众多、流动性较大的购债人的需要，但最迟在四月份内就可普遍发到所有认购者的手里。
    目前，各界人民已陆续向各地人民银行缴公债款。各地人民银行已开给缴款人以临时收据，将来公债券运到并开始发行时，缴款人就可持临时收据向原开发该收据的银行换领公债券。
