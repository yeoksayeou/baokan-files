    Seeing the Superiority of State Capitalism from Several Joint State-Private Coal Mines in Chongqing
    Kong Xun, Director of the Southwest Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry
    In the past two or three years, Chongqing's joint state-private Tianfu, Donglin, and Hua'an Coal Mining Companies and their affiliated mines, under the direct leadership of the state-owned economy, have improved enterprise management, brought into play the production enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff, and enabled production to move from recovery to development. They have achieved remarkable results in ensuring coal for industry and transportation, meeting market needs, and expanding enterprise reproduction, fundamentally changing the face of the enterprises.
    Difficult Period
    Tianfu, Donglin, and Hua'an are three enterprises of different sizes, large, medium, and small. The three companies have a total of five coal mines, of which the Tianfu, Quanjin, and Jiayang coal mines under the Tianfu Company account for about 65 percent of the total coal consumption in the Chongqing area. In the early days of liberation in 1950, due to the Kuomintang bandits' frantic sabotage, the countryside and the entire industry and commerce had not yet recovered. After the national financial and economic unification, prices stabilized, and the false purchasing power in the market disappeared, resulting in a temporary stagnation in coal and coke sales, with sales less than two-thirds of normal production. In addition, there were many serious shortcomings and unreasonable phenomena in management. By the end of 1950, the Tianfu Company's total losses and debts amounted to 12 billion yuan, and the maximum amount of coal owed was more than 40,000 tons. Donglin Company's debts amounted to 1.5 billion yuan in currency alone. In addition, it owed more than 3,000 tons of washed coke, and wages were generally in arrears for more than two or three months, affecting the lives of workers and staff. Raw materials were exhausted, expansion projects could not be carried out, and production was extremely difficult. Although these companies intended to carry out some necessary reforms during this period, the shareholders lacked confidence in the future of the enterprises and even regarded them as a burden, so the difficulties remained serious.
    The Process of Joint State-Private Operation
    When these companies were in difficulty, the People's Government, taking into account the different situations of each company, adopted various methods such as low-interest loans, acquisitions, additional machinery and equipment, and assistance to workers and staff in changing jobs, providing care and support in many ways. However, because the various serious shortcomings and unreasonable phenomena in the management and production of these private capitalist enterprises that grew up in the old society remained largely unchanged, they were ultimately unable to fundamentally reverse this paralyzed situation and were only spared from shutting down.
    Under the enthusiastic concern and promotion of the broad masses of workers and staff, these companies considered how to effectively overcome the current difficulties and the long-term future of the enterprises. After several board of directors' symposiums or in the form of expanded business meetings, worker representatives were invited to discuss together. As a result, they unanimously recognized that they must accept the government's management, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the worker masses, and implement the socialist transformation of the old enterprises in order to save the enterprises and further promote their development.
    In the spring of 1951, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the former Southwest Military and Political Committee was established. In order to strengthen the leadership and support of these enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, with the request of these companies and the consent of the Southwest Financial and Economic Committee, these enterprises were formally reorganized into joint state-private enterprises, under the leadership of the Southwest Coal Mine Administration Bureau. At the same time, state representatives or supervisors were sent to participate in and reorganize the board of directors, negotiate the distribution of board seats, study and decide on business policies, expand production, and other issues, and convene shareholders' meetings regularly to report on production and financial situations. On the one hand, the state sent cadres to participate in business management to promote the company and the business of each mine. This was the starting point for fundamentally changing the face of these enterprises.
    After the joint state-private operation, a series of rectification and reform work was carried out immediately. First of all, on the premise of determining that the state share was in a leading position, the state and private share representatives respected each other's rights and interests, absorbed labor representatives to participate, and jointly organized a company asset-liability and equity clearing committee to carry out complex clearing work on the company's property and equity, and determined the stock value, so that the stocks that had been regarded as waste paper restored their actual value. At the same time, the policy of "relying on workers and uniting staff" was resolutely implemented, democratic reforms were carried out, and the masses were fully mobilized in the democratic reforms. A group of activists among the workers was promoted to manage production, and the organization and personnel were adjusted accordingly according to the needs of the enterprise through the democratic consultation committee jointly formed by labor and management. Non-production expenses were reduced, and the various problems of the old enterprise in organizational structure, labor-management relations, production, and management were effectively cured. Unreasonable systems were abolished, a reasonable democratic management system was established, and the policy of determining sales by output was determined. The transportation and procurement business of each company was handed over to the government for unified dispatch in order to unify control and adjust the needs of the entire society, and to bring production into the orbit of the national plan. Production was carried out in accordance with the national plan, and the blindness of the capitalist free market was abandoned. Due to the change in production relations, the workers realized that their work was in line with the interests of the country and the people, and on this basis, the patriotic production increase competition to resist US aggression and aid Korea was launched, which greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff.
    A Completely New Atmosphere
    Since the joint state-private operation, these companies have experienced unprecedented changes in the past two years, enabling the productive forces to obtain new development. From October 1952, after preliminary achievements were made in the democratic reforms, production reform work was carried out systematically. During the production reform period, on the one hand, leading cadres went deep into production, mobilized the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, promoted advanced experience, solved many major key problems, strengthened workshop original records, formulated various advanced quotas, and tried out job plans and scheduling work. The eight-grade wage system was implemented, and the economic accounting system has been initially implemented in various factories and mining enterprises. Planned management was established, and production was managed using advanced socialist scientific methods. On the other hand, reforms were carried out in production methods, learning from advanced Soviet experience, and promoting new coal mining methods to change the capitalist predatory mining methods that brought disasters and destruction to safe production and national resources in the past. At present, except for Hua'an, which is still in the trial stage of the new coal mining method, the new method of coal mining in the Tianfu Coal Mine under the Tianfu Company accounts for 30.2 percent of the total coal mining, and the Donglin Coal Mine has implemented the new coal mining method 100 percent. As a result of the promotion of the new coal mining method, the coal recovery rate has generally increased compared with the past. The average of the Tianfu mines has increased from 69.7 percent before the joint operation to 84.8 percent, the Donglin Coal Mine has increased from 60 percent to 94 percent, and although the Hua'an Coal Mine has not yet formally implemented the new coal mining method, due to the increased awareness of the workers, the protection of national resources has been strengthened, and waste has been reduced, so that the recovery rate has also increased from 80 percent to 90.24 percent. Before the joint operation, all the mines were manually mined. Now, the Tianfu Mine under the Tianfu Company has started using wind picks and blasting mining since 1952. The Jiayang Coal Mine is actively preparing the working face, and will soon try out the latest Soviet-style coal cutting machine mining in the southwest for the first time. The Donglin Coal Mine will also use wind picks and blasting mining from 1954.
    After a series of reforms in production management and production methods, and the partial use of mechanization, the factories and mines under these companies have shown an unprecedented new atmosphere in terms of output, quality, labor productivity, cost, and safe production.
    1. The output of raw coal, the situation of the annual growth of each company is as follows:

    The growth rate of metallurgical coke is even greater. Except for Hua'an, which has no products, the output of Tianfu Company in 1953 was 378.16 percent of that in 1950, and Donglin was 503.09 percent.
    2. Quality: In the past, due to the predatory mining of "mining internal connections and not mining external connections," not only was the national resource seriously wasted, but also brought great difficulties to mining. After the joint operation, in order to protect national resources and enable resources to be fully utilized, it was necessary to switch from mining internal connections to mining external connections; however, external connections have many夹石 (gangue), and the ash content is heavy, which seriously affects the quality of raw coal, and this situation is most serious in the Tianfu Coal Mine of Tianfu Company; however, after mobilizing workers to work hard to improve washing and selection equipment, strengthen underground and ground manual selection, and establish a product quality responsibility system, and after forming the improvement of quality into a broad mass movement, recently the ash content of raw coal in Tianfu has been reduced by 1.8 percent compared with the original, Jiayang has been reduced by 1.36 percent, Quanjin has been reduced by 3.19 percent, Donglin has been reduced by 3.35 percent, and Hua'an has been reduced by 4 percent. In terms of metallurgical coke, in order to meet the quality requirements of iron and steel smelting, many improvements have been made in management and technology. After adjusting the coal washing tank and strictly implementing the reasonable blending of coking raw coal, the sulfur content of coke has been significantly reduced. The Tianfu Mine has reduced from more than 1.5 percent to 1.25 percent, and Donglin has reduced from the lowest 1.68 percent to 1.43 percent, all of which have reached below the specified standards.
    3. Labor productivity, taking 100 as the base in 1950 before the joint operation, the comprehensive average of Tianfu mines was 109 in 1951, 156.49 in 1952, and 174.06 in 1953. The Donglin Coal Mine was 317.78 in 1951, 446.42 in 1952, and 783.88 in 1953. The Hua'an Coal Mine was 180.26 in 1951, 254.56 in 1952, and 290.46 in 1953.
    4. Cost reduction, so far, the average of Tianfu mines has been reduced by 5.06 percent compared with 1951, the Donglin Coal Mine has been reduced by 21.88 percent compared with 1951, and the Hua'an Coal Mine has been reduced by 27.05 percent compared with 1950.
    5. Safe production is the fundamental problem in the coal mining industry. Before the joint operation, due to the greed of capitalism in management, cheap investment was used in exchange for a large amount of coal to ensure the maximum profit, driving workers to produce in situations where equipment was simple, ventilation was poor, the temperature in the mine was too high, methane explosions were extremely easy to occur, and the safety of life was not guaranteed at all. Therefore, the safety situation of each mine was extremely bad. From 1939 to 1950 alone, the Tianfu Coal Mine had as many as 49 methane explosions, of which the methane explosion in the No. 3 well in May 1948 killed 98 people and injured 10 people in one incident, which is enough to prove the severity of the safety situation.
    After the joint operation, the policy of combining safety and production was conscientiously implemented, and workers and staff were widely educated in safety ideology, technical safety inspection institutions were established, various necessary guarantees were made from organizational systems, and many specific measures for safe operation were improved, such as brushing large roadways, blocking air leaks, changing sharp bends to slow bends, increasing the mechanical ventilation force, increasing the effective air volume, regularly checking methane content, changing to electric ignition blasting, strictly implementing technical safety regulations, and strengthening inspection and prevention work. Therefore, methane explosion accidents have been effectively prevented in the past two or three years. Especially after April 1953, each mine followed the regulations of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, and generally established a weekly safety activity day to carry out mass safety education work, and achieved certain results in safety measures, technical management, and equipment improvement. And made safety production gradually combined with planned management, and discussed and formulated safety measures plans while mobilizing the masses to discuss production plans. The Donglin Coal Mine has completely changed natural ventilation to mechanical ventilation. The Tianfu Coal Mine has established a militarized mine rescue team, and the No. 3 well has installed high-pressure water and artificial water pressure sprayers to extinguish coal dust that has not been solved for many years. The mine also carried out a large-scale flood prevention project before the peach flood last year, ensuring normal production during the flood, and cultivated and established He Yuqing and Ran Longfu for more than two years without deaths and minor injuries and the model group of Yue Yachao in the electromechanical plant who has been operating safely for two years and ten months without accidents.
    After the above-mentioned correct measures, the safety situation of each mine has greatly improved compared with before the joint operation. The number of casualties has decreased year by year. According to the statistics of each mine, the number of casualties per 10,000 tons of coal produced in 1952 decreased by 11 percent compared with 1951 (there is no data before the joint operation), and from January to November 1953, it decreased by 14 percent compared with the same period in 1952. Among them, the Hua'an Coal Mine has achieved more remarkable results. The number of casualties per 10,000 tons of coal mined in the mine has decreased by 19 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, and from January to November 1953, it has decreased by 60 percent compared with the same period in 1952, and won the model title of safe production of the mines under the Southwest Coal Mine Administration Bureau.
    Social Benefit, Benefit for All Parties
    After the joint operation, with the development of production, the increase in output, and the reduction in cost, these companies have reduced the selling price of coal and coke twice. Tianfu mines reduced by 15.01 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, and reduced by 10.55 percent in 1953 compared with 1952. Donglin Coal Mine reduced by 8.95 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, and reduced by 11.51 percent in 1953 compared with 1952. Hua'an Coal Mine reduced by 12.83 percent in 1952 compared with 1951, and reduced by 3.74 percent in 1953 compared with 1952. This not only created good conditions for other industrial and transportation coal-using units to reduce costs, and made the society benefit greatly; but also the financial situation of the enterprises themselves quickly turned from loss to profit, and the profit increased significantly. For example, Tianfu Company lost 4.5 billion yuan in 1950, and lost more than 2 billion yuan in January to April 1951 before the joint operation. After the joint operation, from May to December, it not only made up for the original losses, but also had a surplus of more than 4 billion yuan. The company's profit in 1952 increased even more significantly to 29.9 billion yuan. Donglin Company lost 2.9 billion yuan in 1950, and the profit after the joint operation in 1951 was more than 600 million yuan, which increased to 1.4 billion yuan in 1952. Hua'an Company only maintained a balance in 1950, and the profit after the joint operation in 1951 was 800 million yuan, which increased to 1.8 billion yuan in 1952. Since September 1953, after the mines have deeply launched the increase production and economy campaign, it is expected that the planned profit can also be completed or overcompleted.
    With the development of production and the continuous increase in enterprise profits, and because enterprise profits are distributed according to national income tax, enterprise public welfare funds, employee welfare bonuses, and capitalist dividends and bonuses, the strength of the enterprises has been greatly enhanced compared with before, providing conditions for expanding reproduction. For example, Tianfu and Donglin companies alone had a basic construction appropriation of 11 billion yuan from basic depreciation and public welfare funds in 1953. Employee wages and welfare have also gradually increased, and the lives of employees have been further improved. Labor enthusiasm has also shown a new upsurge. In 1953, the average wage of employees in Tianfu mines was 120.54 percent of that before the joint operation, Donglin was 395.60 percent of that before the joint operation, and Hua'an was 216.06 percent of that before the joint operation; the funds allocated from enterprise profits to employee welfare and safety and health equipment have also increased year by year. The total of the three companies was 700 million yuan in 1951, which soared to 6.9 billion yuan in 1952. Capitalists were deeply satisfied with the revaluation of assets, the clearing of equity, and the restoration of stock value. From 1951, they began to receive dividends and bonuses that they had not received for many years. Tianfu distributed dividends of 4 percent in 1951, and distributed dividends of 6 percent and bonuses of 2 percent in 1952. Donglin distributed dividends of 6 percent in 1952. Hua'an had never distributed dividends and bonuses in the past. Since 1951, they have received dividends of 6 percent and bonuses of 4 percent twice in a row. It has truly achieved the benefit of capitalists, improved the enthusiasm of operation, and the number of attendees at the shareholders' meeting has increased year by year. As Kang Xinru, the executive director of Tianfu Company, said: "I have invested in fourteen enterprises, three of which are private and eleven of which are joint state-private. The three private ones are still losing money and have not distributed dividends and bonuses; among the eleven joint state-private ones, except for two that have not distributed dividends and bonuses due to special circumstances, the remaining nine have received dividends, and Tianfu Company has also received bonuses, which are all due to the joint state-private operation."
    Basic Construction for a Century-Long Plan
    In addition to Hua'an, which only maintains the existing production level due to the excessive thinness of the coal seam, the small amount of reserves, and the limited development prospects of the mine, the remaining mines under the three companies have obtained government basic construction investment since 1952 with the recovery and development of production and the increasing needs of the country and the people, and have engaged in basic construction projects for a century-long plan. The government investment in Tianfu mines in the past two years has accounted for more than 100 percent of the original total capital, and the Donglin Coal Mine has accounted for 440 percent of the original capital. More than 22,000 square meters of employee housing, bathrooms, hospitals, canteens, etc. have been added, and 148 major mechanical equipment have been added. Large-scale reconstruction and expansion projects have been carried out. Once the reconstruction is completed and the degree of mechanization is increased, the output will increase by half to double the existing production capacity, the quality will be significantly improved, and the cost will also be greatly reduced, which will more powerfully support and cooperate with the construction of industry and transportation in the southwest region. Huang Zhi, the former manager of Tianfu Company (now the deputy general manager), said excitedly when he saw the 1502 project of Tianfu Coal Mine: "We have fantasized about such a project in the past, but it was just a fantasy. We did not expect that it would become a reality in a short time after the joint state-private operation."
    In the past two or three years, preliminary achievements have been made in the socialist transformation of Chongqing's coal mining industry. However, at present, various mechanical equipment, technical operations, and various technical and economic quotas are far behind the level of other advanced regions in our country. The cost still needs to be greatly reduced, the safety situation needs to be further improved, and the passive situation where tunneling cannot keep up with mining is still the main problem in production, and production management is still behind the enthusiasm of the workers. These shortcomings still need to be improved by the unity and hard work of all workers and staff and state and private shareholders in order to cooperate with the country's economic construction and advance.

    从重庆市几个公私合营煤矿看国家资本主义的优越性
    中央燃料工业部西南煤矿管理局局长　孔勋
    重庆市公私合营天府、东林、华安等煤矿公司及所属各矿，两三年来在国营经济直接领导下，改善了企业管理，发挥了广大职工生产的积极性与创造性，使生产从恢复走向了发展；对保证工业、交通用煤，满足市场需要，扩大企业再生产，均获得了显著的成绩，从根本上改变了企业的面貌。
    困难时期
    天府、东林和华安是三个大、中、小规模不同的企业，三个公司共有五个煤矿，其中天府公司所属天府、全济、嘉阳三个煤矿经营销量占重庆地区全部用煤的百分之六十五左右。一九五○年解放初期，由于蒋匪溃退时的疯狂破坏，农村和整个工商业尚未恢复，全国财经统一以后，物价稳定，过去市场上的虚假购买力顿形消失，于是形成暂时的煤焦滞销，销量不足正常生产情况的三分之二。加以在经营管理上又存在着许多严重的缺点与不合理的现象，截至一九五○年底止，天府公司各项亏损和负债共达一二○亿元，欠煤最多时曾达四万余吨。东林公司负债仅货币一项就有十五亿元，此外，还欠交洗焦三千余吨，积欠工资一般均在两三个月以上，影响职工生活，原材料枯竭，扩展工程无法进行，生产极感困难。这些公司在此期间虽曾打算进行一些必要的改革，但由于股东们对企业前途缺乏信心，甚至视为包袱，困难依然严重存在。
    公私合营经过
    这些公司在困难的时候，人民政府曾针对各个公司的不同情况，分别采用低息借款，收购，添拨机器设备，协助职工转业等方式，从多方面予以照顾和扶持。但由于这些从旧社会成长起来的私人资本主义企业在经营管理和生产方面各种严重的缺点与不合理的现象仍大都原封未动，因而终于没有能够从根本上扭转这种瘫痪局面，仅幸免于停工而已。
    这些公司在广大职工热情关怀和推动下，考虑了如何才能够有效地克服当前的困难，并考虑了企业的长远前途，经过多次董监事座谈或采用扩大业务会议的形式，邀请工人代表共同讨论，结果一致认识到必须接受政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督、实行对旧企业的社会主义的改造，才能够使企业得救，并进一步促使企业的发展。
    一九五一年春原西南军政委员会工业部煤矿管理局成立，为了加强对这些有益国计民生的企业的领导和扶植，经过这些公司的请求和西南财政经济委员会同意，将这几个企业正式改组为公私合营，由西南煤矿管理局负责领导，同时并分别派公股代表或监理人员参加和改组了董事会，协商分配董事会名额，研究并决定经营方针、扩大生产等问题，定期召集股东大会，报告生产、财务情况；一面并由国家派遣干部参加经营管理，推动公司及各矿业务，这是从根本上改变这些企业面貌的起点。
    公私合营以后，随即进行了一系列的整顿与改革工作。首先在确定公股是处于领导地位的前提下，公私股代表互相尊重双方权益，吸收劳方代表参加，共同组织了公司资产负债、股权的清理委员会，对公司财产和股权进行了繁复的清理工作，确定了股值，使已经视为废纸的股票恢复了它的实际价值。与此同时并坚决贯彻“依靠工人，团结职员”的方针，进行了民主改革，并在民主改革中充分发动了群众，提拔了一批工人中的积极分子来管理生产，又通过劳资双方共同组成的民主协商委员会，针对企业需要，相应地调整了组织、人员，紧缩了非生产的开支，将旧企业在组织机构、劳资关系、生产和经营管理上的各种病根加以有效的根治，废除了不合理的制度，建立了合理的民主管理制度，确定了量销为产的方针，将各公司的运销采购业务，交由政府统一调度，以便统一掌握与调剂整个社会需要，把生产纳入国家计划的轨道，遵照国家计划进行生产，摆脱了资本主义自由市场的盲目性。由于生产关系的改变，使工人认识到自己的工作与国家和人民利益的一致，并在这一基础上展开了抗美援朝爱国增产竞赛，大大地鼓舞了职工群众的劳动热情。
    焕然一新的气象
    自公私合营以后，两年多来，这些公司经历了历史上前所未有的变化，使生产力获得了新的发展。一九五二年十月份起，在民主改革取得了初步成绩以后，有系统地进行了生产改革工作。在生产改革期中，一方面由于领导干部深入生产，发动群众提合理化建议，推行先进经验，解决了许多重大关键问题，加强了车间原始记录，制订了各种先进定额，试行了作业计划与调度工作，实行了八级工资制，已初步在各厂矿企业实行了经济核算制，建立了计划管理，用先进的社会主义的科学方法管理生产。另方面实行了生产方法上的改革，学习苏联先进经验，推广了新采煤方法，以改变过去资本主义掠夺式的采掘方法对安全生产与国家资源所带来的灾害和破坏作用。现在新采煤方法除华安尚在试行阶段外，天府公司所属天府煤矿新法采煤已占全部采煤的比重百分之三○·二，东林煤矿已百分之百地实行了新式采煤方法。由于推行新法采煤的结果，使煤炭回采率普遍较前提高，天府各矿平均由合营以前的百分之六九·七提高到百分之八四·八，东林煤矿由百分之六○提高到百分之九四，华安煤矿虽尚未正式实行新采煤方法，但由于工人觉悟提高，加强了对国家资源的爱护，减少了浪费，使回采率亦由百分之八十提高到百分之九○·二四。各矿在合营以前全系手工采煤，现天府公司所属天府矿自一九五二年起即已开始采用了风镐和爆破采煤、嘉阳煤矿正积极准备工作面，最近即将在西南首先试用苏联最新式的割煤机采煤，东林煤矿在一九五四年起亦将使用风镐和爆破采煤。
    这些公司所属厂矿，在合营以后，通过生产管理和生产方法一系列的改革，并部分使用机械化的结果，无论在产量、质量、劳动生产率、成本和安全生产各方面，都呈现了前所未有的新气象。
    1、原煤产量，各公司逐年增长的情形如下：
    冶金焦增长的速度更大，除华安无产品外，天府公司一九五三年产量为一九五○年的百分之三七八·一六，东林为百分之五○三·○九。
    2、质量方面：过去由于“光采内连，不采外连”的掠夺式的开采，既严重地浪费了国家资源，又给采掘上带来了极大的困难。合营以后，为了保护国家资源，使资源能够得到充分的利用，不得不从内连转采外连；但外连由于夹石多，灰分重，严重地影响了原煤质量，这种情形又以天府公司的天府煤矿为最甚；但经发动职工努力改进洗选设备，加强井下地面手选，建立产品质量责任制，把改进质量形成为广泛的群众运动以后，最近原煤灰分天府已较原来降低百分之一·八，嘉阳降低百分之一·三六，全济降低百分之三·一九，东林降低百分之三·三五，华安降低百分之四。冶金焦方面为了适合炼铁炼钢对质量的要求，在管理上与技术上均作了很多的改进，经调整洗煤槽并严格执行合理掺配炼焦原煤后，使焦的含硫显著降低，天府矿由原来的百分之一·五以上，降低为百分之一·二五，东林由最低百分之一·六八降为百分之一·四三，都达到了规定标准以下。
    3、劳动生产率以一九五○年合营以前为一百，天府各矿综合平均一九五一年为一○九，一九五二年为一五六·四九，一九五三年为一七四·○六。东林煤矿一九五一年为三一七·七八，一九五二年为四四六·四二，一九五三年为七八三·八八。华安煤矿一九五一年为一八○·二六，一九五二年为二五四·五六，一九五三年为二九○·四六。
    4、成本降低情形，至目前为止，天府各矿平均较一九五一年降低百分之五·○六，东林煤矿较一九五一年降低百分之二一·八八，华安煤矿较一九五○年降低百分之二七·○五。
    5、安全生产是煤矿工业中的根本问题，在合营以前由于资本主义在经营管理上的贪吝，用廉价的投资换取大量出煤，以保证最大限度的利润，驱使工人在设备简陋、通风不良、井下温度过高、极易引起瓦斯爆炸、生命安全毫无保障的情况下进行生产。因此各矿安全情况极为恶劣，仅天府煤矿自一九三九年起一九五○年止，即连续发生瓦斯爆炸四十九次之多，其中一九四八年五月三井瓦斯爆炸，一次即死亡九十八人，伤十人，足证安全情况的恶劣。
    合营以后，认真贯彻了安全与生产相结合的方针，对职工进行了广泛的安全思想教育，建立了技术安全检查机构，从组织制度上作了各种必要的保证，并改善了安全作业的许多具体措施，如刷大巷道、堵塞漏风、改急弯为缓弯、加大机械通风力量、增加有效风量、经常检查瓦斯含量、改用电引放炮、严格执行技术保安规程、加强检查和预防工作，因此两三年来得以有效地防止了瓦斯爆炸事故，特别是一九五三年四月以后，各矿均遵照中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局的规定，普遍建立了每周的安全活动日，开展群众性的安全教育工作，在安全措施、技术管理和设备改善方面，都取得了一定成绩。并使安全生产与计划管理逐步结合，在发动群众讨论生产计划同时讨论并订立了安全措施计划。东林煤矿已将自然通风全部改为机械通风。天府煤矿成立了军事化的矿山救护队，三井安装了高压水及人工压水使用喷雾器，扑灭了多年来没有解决的煤尘，该矿去年并在桃汛以前进行了规模巨大的防洪工程，保证了洪水时间的正常生产，培养和树立了何玉清、冉隆富两年多来未发生死亡与轻重伤和机电厂岳亚超安全运转两年另十个月未出事故的模范小组。
    经过上述各项正确措施以后，各矿安全情况已较合营以前大为好转。伤亡人数逐年减少。根据各矿统计每产煤万吨伤亡人数一九五二年较一九五一年减少了百分之十一（合营以前无资料），一九五三年一至十一月又比一九五二年同期减少百分之十四。其中华安煤矿成绩更为显著，该矿每采煤万吨伤亡人数一九五二年比一九五一年已减少百分之十九，一九五三年一至十一月比一九五二年同期又减少百分之六十，获得了西南煤矿管理局所属各矿安全生产的模范称号。
    社会受益、各方有利
    合营以后，随着生产的发展，产量的提高，成本的降低，这些公司曾两次降低煤焦售价。天府各矿一九五二年较一九五一年降低百分之一五·○一，一九五三年较一九五二年又降低百分之一○·五五，东林煤矿一九五二年比一九五一年降低百分之八·九五，一九五三年比一九五二年又降低百分之一一·五一，华安煤矿一九五二年较一九五一年降低百分之一二·八三，一九五三年比一九五二年又降低百分之三·七四。这不仅为其他工业、交通用煤单位降低成本创造了良好条件，使社会受益很大；而且企业本身财务情况亦迅速转亏为盈，利润显著增加，如天府公司在一九五○年亏损四五亿元，就在一九五一年合营以前仅一至四月即亏损二十余亿元，合营以后，五至十二月不但弥补了原来的亏损，并且还盈余四十多亿元，该公司一九五二年盈利更显著地增加到二九九亿元。东林公司一九五○年亏损二九亿元，一九五一年合营后利润为六亿多元，一九五二年增加为一四亿元。华安公司一九五○年仅保持平衡，一九五一年合营以后利润为八亿元，一九五二年更增加为一八亿元。一九五三年九月份起各矿深入展开增产节约以后，预计亦可按计划利润完成或超额完成。
    随着生产的发展，企业利润不断增加，又由于企业利润系按国家所得税、企业公积金、职工福利奖金和资本家股息、红利进行分配，因之使企业的实力较前大为增强，为扩大再生产提供了条件。如天府与东林两公司仅一九五三年由基本折旧与公积金的自筹基本建设拨款即达一一○亿元。职工工资福利也随之逐渐提高，职工生活得到进一步改善。劳动热情亦呈现出新的高涨，一九五三年职工平均工资天府各矿为合营以前的百分之一二○·五四，东林为合营前的百分之三九五·六○，华安为合营前的百分之二一六·○六；从企业利润中分配于职工福利及安全卫生设备基金亦逐年增加。三个公司一九五一年共为七亿元，一九五二年便激增为六九亿元。资本家在重估财产、清理股权、恢复股值中，深感满意，从一九五一年起又开始分得多年来没有分得的股息和红利。天府一九五一年分了股息四厘，一九五二年又分了股息六厘、红利二厘。东林一九五二年分了股息六厘。华安过去就从来没有分过股息、红利，自一九五一年起接连两次都分得了股息六厘，红利四厘。真正做到了资本家有利可得，提高了经营的积极性，股东大会到会人数逐年增加。正如天府公司常务董事康心如所说：“我投资了十四个企业，其中有三个私营，十一个公私合营。三个私营至今还在亏本，没有分配股息、红利；十一个公私合营除两个因特殊情况未分股息、红利外，其余九个都分得了股息，天府公司并分得了红利，这都是公私合营的缘故。”
    百年大计的基本建设
    三个公司及所属各矿，除华安因煤层过薄、藏量不多、矿井发展前途有限，仅维持现有生产水平而外，其余各矿随着生产的恢复和发展，国家和人民日益增长的需要，自一九五二年起获得了政府的基本建设投资，从事了百年大计的基本建设工程，天府各矿两年来政府投资已占原有资本总额的百分之一百以上，东林煤矿为原有资本的百分之四四○。添建了职工住宅、浴室、医院、食堂等共二万二千多平方公尺，已增加了各种主要机械设备一四八台，从事了大规模的改建和扩建工程，一俟改建竣工，机械化程度增加，产量将较现有生产能力增加一半到一倍以上，质量将有显著提高，成本亦将大量减低，将更有力地支持与配合西南地区工业和交通的建设。原天府公司经理黄志（现任副总经理）看到天府煤矿一五○二工程时兴奋地说：“这样的工程在过去我们幻想过，但也只是幻想而已，没有意料到公私合营不久，短时间就要变成现实了。”
    过去两三年来，对重庆煤矿工业实现社会主义的改造，已经取得了初步的成绩。但目前在各种机械设备、技术操作、各种技术经济定额，还远落后于我国其他先进地区的水平。成本还需要大力降低，安全情况还要继续改进，掘进跟不上回采的被动局面依然还是生产中的主要问题，生产管理仍然落后于工人的积极性，诸如这些缺点，还有待于全体职工和公私股东团结一致，努力改进，为配合国家经济建设前进。（附图表）
