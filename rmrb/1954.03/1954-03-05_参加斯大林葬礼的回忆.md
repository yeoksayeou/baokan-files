    Recollections of Attending Stalin's Funeral
    Guo Moruo
    It has been a year in the blink of an eye since Comrade Stalin passed away. Over the past year, this profound grief has indeed become a source of inexhaustible strength for us.
    I attended Stalin's funeral last year, and now I would like to recall the situation at that time and report it to the whole country. This is not to relive our pain, but to further strengthen our resolve.
    Last year, after the announcement of Stalin's serious illness on March 4th, the entire Chinese people were shrouded in premonitions of the greatest misfortune. On the night of March 5th, Stalin finally left us, and the people's grief was truly beyond comparison.
    Although everyone knew that Stalin is immortal, just as Marx, Engels, and Lenin are forever leading us, Stalin's spirit, thought, and doctrine will forever lead us. But inexpressible grief could not be restrained, and tears welled up at all times, tears that poured out from the deepest recesses of our hearts.
    At dawn on March 7th, our delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, flew to Moscow to offer condolences. The weather seemed to be helping us on our way, flying very smoothly. I was on the same plane with Premier Zhou. We flew for five hours and arrived at Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, at noon. Senior leaders of the Mongolian government, headed by Premier Tsedenbal, greeted us at the airport. The national flags of China and Mongolia, bordered in black, were hung on the gate of the airport. Grief was shared, and the feelings in our hearts were equally deeply expressed on the faces of our Mongolian comrades.
    Premier Tsedenbal was also going to Moscow to offer condolences, and he flew with us to the Soviet border.
    We arrived in Irkutsk at 3:30. The usual practice is to stay overnight in Irkutsk after flying from Beijing, and it takes another two days to fly to Moscow. But this time, in order to be able to catch the funeral at noon on the 9th, we had to shorten the schedule. Therefore, at 6:00 p.m. that day, we changed to a Soviet plane and continued flying west, arriving in Novosibirsk at midnight.
    We spent the night in Novosibirsk. We took off again on the morning of the 8th, and finally flew to Moscow at 3:00 p.m. Soviet government leaders, headed by Vice Chairman Mikoyan, greeted us at the airport. A somber mood permeated everyone's depressed yet determined expressions.
    At 8:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the 8th, all members of the delegation followed Premier Zhou to the House of Trade Unions to pay respects to Stalin's remains.
      The people paying their respects to the remains seemed to have gathered all of humanity. People of all colors and races mixed together, grieving, piously, and silently, flowing like water through a lock. Going up and down the stairs, although people going in kept to the right and people coming out kept to the left, with people holding hands to separate them in the middle, all obeying a certain order, there were too many people, crowded shoulder to shoulder, almost not walking on their own, but forming a whole flow.
    The House of Trade Unions is not far from the Kremlin, and I have been there more than once before. On New Year's Eve in 1952, I participated in the New Year's celebration for Moscow youth, sending off 1952 and welcoming 1953, which was also in the hall of this building. The entire hall, built of marble, has many magnificent and solemn columns, and the impression it left in my mind was very spacious. But this time it seemed different. With the remains of the great Stalin resting here, it was as if the universe was not big enough to contain the remains, and the flow of people paying their respects gathered here into an ocean, which would make any spacious hall seem narrow in comparison.
    Stalin's remains rested on a platform that was not very high. The platform was temporary, in the center of the long side of the columned hall. Red banners with the Soviet national emblem and the emblems of the various republics were hung around, forming a square mourning hall. On either side of the platform, in the center, were two armed comrades facing each other on guard, followed by the mourners standing guard.
    Solemn music was played on the inherent high platform on the left.
    We held a large wreath and followed Premier Zhou to the front of the bier. We offered the wreath, stood and paid our highest respects, and remained silent for three minutes. Tears could not help but well up again.
    After the salute, we were led past the back of the remains from the right and into a lounge. Here, we were received by Comrade Yasnov of the Funeral Committee, saw Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Kuznetsov, saw Academician Yudin, who had lectured in China twice, and also saw Marshal Budyonny and other marshals who had come to stand guard.
    After waiting for a while, it was our turn to stand guard. We were again led to the right side of the remains, in groups of six, divided into two rows, closely following the armed comrades on guard, standing face to face in solemn silence, conducting a three-minute guard.
    Stalin's remains, dressed in the uniform of a Grand Marshal, lay quietly supine, with his eyes closed. His face was so solemn and amiable, as if he was still breathing. His hands, placed flat on his legs, also seemed to have a pulse beating under the skin. I was one of the last Chinese to shake that warm hand. Isn't the warmth on that hand still on my hand?
    On the evening of January 13th last year, Stalin had received Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling and me.
    That was in Stalin's office in the Kremlin, a simple, solemn, and quiet rectangular room. A desk was placed diagonally in the right corner of the room opposite the door, piled with documents. In the left corner was an old-fashioned large fireplace. Near the fireplace was a side door, probably leading to the inner room.
    On the inner wall, four historical figures were lined up: oil paintings of the famous Tsarist generals Suvorov and Kutuzov, and photographs of Marx and Lenin. Apart from these, there were no other decorations in the room, and there were no carpets on the floor.
    Below the figures, parallel to the wall, was a long dining table covered with a green baize surface. At this end of the dining table, against the left-hand wall near the entrance, was a tall grandfather clock, with the hour hand pointing to a quarter past ten. Stalin was very healthy, wearing a maroon Lenin-style suit and a light blue shirt. Completely like treating family members, he shook hands with us. He sat under the portrait of Marshal Suvorov and spoke to us for nearly two hours. He was so calm and straightforward, without the slightest bit of pretension or formality. As such a great man, who had opened a new era in human history and had such profound benefits for mankind, sitting in front of him, you did not feel any restraint, but naturally and sincerely felt close and respectful, and were subjected to an unexpected and natural influence.
    He had sincere concern for the Chinese people. He asked us about the life and feelings of the Chinese people after liberation, the work of Chinese women, the development of primary and higher education, the issue of Chinese character reform, and the issue of creating writing systems for minority nationalities.
    He said: The Chinese are good people, hardworking and simple. The imperialists wanted to turn the Chinese into bad people, but they didn't have time.
    He hoped that Chinese women could exert their great potential strength. He hoped that Chinese youth, in addition to valuing technical sciences, should also pay attention to educational studies and win the honor of being teachers of the people.
    He was also particularly concerned about the peace movement, and told us that those engaged in the peace movement should strive to involve the people of those countries who are at risk of launching aggressive wars in the cause of maintaining peace. Those engaged in the peace movement must have a high degree of self-sacrifice, like a French girl who, to oppose the transportation of munitions to Vietnam, lay on the tracks to stop the train from advancing.
      He patiently asked us many questions and answered many questions for us. We were reluctant to leave him, but were afraid that he would be tired, so we had to say goodbye.
    At the end, he still unpretentiously said such a sentence: "It is not easy for you to make me tired."
    Stalin finally shook hands with us to say goodbye. -- I was one of the last Chinese to shake his warm hand, but only fifty days apart, who can believe that the warmth of Stalin still on my hand is not still on Stalin's hand?
      The 9th was the day of the funeral. The weather in Moscow was particularly gloomy that day, and the entire sky seemed to be covered with a layer of black veil.
    It was very cold, with a bit of north wind. Snowflakes were floating from time to time.
    Premier Zhou Enlai first went to the House of Trade Unions at 8:00 to guard the remains, and the rest of us went to Red Square at 9:00 to attend the funeral. When we arrived at Red Square, the spectators had almost filled the stands, and we had to choose to stand at a relatively high level.
      "Pravda" translated and published Chairman Mao's "Greatest Friendship," and the article was accompanied by a photo of Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Malenkov taken when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed in February 1950. People on the stands could be seen reading this article everywhere.
    At about 10:30, the sound of mourning music entered Red Square. People turned their heads and looked at the entrance of Red Square next to the History Museum. The entire universe became solemn. People held their breath. Apart from the mourning music, there was no sound. The funeral procession departing from the House of Trade Unions slowly entered Red Square to the rhythm of the mourning music. First were the wreaths, followed by senior generals holding the medals and awards that Stalin had received during his lifetime on red velvet cushions.
    Six pure black horses pulled Stalin's coffin on the gun carriage. Stalin's face, through the crystal coffin lid, looked up to the sky, meeting the citizens of Moscow, the representatives of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the representatives of the various nationalities of the world. The entire audience took off their hats and observed a moment of silence in the wind and snow. Many people were in tears.
    The coffin arrived in front of Lenin's Mausoleum – the frontispiece of the current Lenin Mausoleum has been changed to "Lenin – Stalin" – facing the entrance of the tomb, and was placed in the very center of Red Square. The leaders of the Soviet government and the leaders of the brotherly countries and brotherly parties who followed the coffin in procession successively ascended the tomb platform.
    The memorial service began.
    The loud and powerful voice, as if it came from Stalin's mouth, resounded throughout Red Square and throughout the entire world. The entire audience listened silently to the report of Malenkov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.
    At nearly 12:00, the report was completed. The leaders stepped down from the tomb platform and carried Stalin's coffin into the mausoleum, side by side with Lenin's remains.
    Artillery salutes shook the entire venue and the entire gloomy sky.
    The Soviet national anthem was played loudly.
    The funeral was coming to an end. The leaders ascended the tomb platform again, and the marshals and generals of the Soviet Union also ascended the tomb platform.
    The Moscow garrison troops participating in the funeral marched past the tomb in formation to bid farewell to Stalin. Formations of supersonic aircraft flew over the tomb. The invincible and victorious steel warriors who defend peace and construction, and the representatives of the Soviet people who have achieved great achievements in socialist construction, walked past the tomb one after another, concretely demonstrating the transformation of deep sorrow into greater strength.
    It has been a year in the blink of an eye since Comrade Stalin passed away. My recollection of attending Stalin's funeral is still like it happened before my eyes.
    A year ago, when the death of Stalin aroused deep grief in the hearts of all good people in the world, a small group of stubborn war provocateurs in the US-British imperialist bloc were harboring schadenfreude. They fantasized that the strength of the Soviet Union might be affected as a result. They fantasized that the solidarity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union would be weakened as a result. They fantasized that the world peace movement would be weakened as a result. However, these despicable fantasies were quickly and thoroughly shattered by the facts.
    Over the past year, we have indeed transformed this profound grief into great strength. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, leading the Soviet people, have continued to consolidate and develop the cause of Lenin and Stalin. They have continued to achieve brilliant achievements in the cause of advancing towards communism. The solidarity and strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has continued to be consolidated and strengthened. The world peace struggle has continued to achieve great victories in the East and the West.
    The great friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet people has also continued to be strengthened. The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, based on the theory of transition from capitalism to socialism founded by Marx and Engels and developed by Lenin and Stalin, and based on our country's specific conditions, have put forward the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, which has become a lighthouse illuminating all our work. Our socialist construction and socialist transformation have also made further progress.
    Stalin was extremely concerned about China's construction. As we commemorate the first anniversary of Stalin's death, we should better study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, better learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building socialism, work hard to produce, work hard, improve our socialist consciousness, and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, unite as one and strive together to build our country into a great socialist country.
    Stalin is the eternal banner for consolidating world peace. As we commemorate the first anniversary of Stalin's death, we should further strengthen the fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the Soviet people, strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people's democratic brother countries, and we will unite with the peace-loving people of the world to fight together against imperialist aggression and war, to ease international tensions, and to defend peace in Asia and world peace.
    Long live communism!

    参加斯大林葬礼的回忆
    郭沫若
    斯大林同志逝世转瞬已经一周年了。一年来，这深重的悲痛确实是成为了我们的不竭的力量的源泉。
    我去年曾经参加了斯大林的葬礼，我现在想把当时的情况回忆一下，向全国报告。这不是要我们把悲痛重新，而是要我们更进一步地把力量加强。
    去年，在三月四号斯大林得了重病的公报发表之后，全中国人民就被笼罩在最大不幸的预感里。三月五号夜晚，斯大林终于离开了我们，人民的悲痛实在是没有任何事例可以用来比拟的。
    尽管大家都知道，斯大林是永远不死的，就和马克思、恩格斯、列宁永远在领导着我们的一样，斯大林的精神、思想和学说也会永远领导着我们。但是无可言喻的悲痛谁也不能克制，眼泪时刻汹涌起来，那是从心坎的最深处涌出来的眼泪。
    三月七号黎明，我们以周恩来总理为首的代表团乘飞机前往莫斯科吊唁。天气好像在帮助我们赶路的一样，飞得非常平稳。我是和周总理同乘着一架飞机的，飞了五个钟头，在中午时分到达蒙古的首都乌兰巴托。机场上有以泽登巴尔总理为首的蒙古政府高级领导人员迎接，航空站的大门上悬挂着加了黑边的中蒙两国国旗。悲痛是共通的，我们心里的感情，在蒙古同志的脸上同样深刻地表露着。
    泽登巴尔总理也要前往莫斯科吊唁，他和我们同机向苏联国境飞去。
    三点半到达了伊尔库茨克。通常的惯例：由北京飞到伊尔库茨克就要留宿一夜，要再飞两天才能飞到莫斯科。但是这一次，为了要能够赶上九号中午的葬礼，我们必须缩短日程。因此，在当天下午六点钟就改乘苏联境内的飞机，向西继续飞行，到半夜时分到达新西伯利亚。
    在新西伯利亚过了一夜。八号清晨再起飞，在下午三点钟终于飞到了莫斯科。机场上有以米高扬副主席为首的苏联政府的首长们迎接，悲痛的情绪同样渗透在每一个人的抑郁而却坚毅的表情里面。
    八号午后八点钟，全体团员随着周总理到工会大厦去参拜斯大林的遗体。
      参拜遗体的人就像把全人类都集中起来了的一样，各种肤色的人种掺杂着，都悲痛地、虔敬地、沉默地、却像闸门过道处的水流一样流涌着，在楼阶上的一上一下，尽管去的人靠右边走，来的人靠左边走，中间有人牵着手拦隔着，都遵守着一定的秩序，然而人太多，肩靠肩地拥挤着，差不多不是自己在走，而是形成了一个整体的流动。
    工会大厦，离克里姆林宫不远，我从前到过不止一次。在一九五二年的除夕，我参加了莫斯科青年的迎年礼，送去一九五二年，迎接一九五三年，也正是在这座大厦的大厅里面的。那全部用大理石筑成的大厅，有不少雄壮而庄严的圆柱，在我脑中所留的印象非常宏敞。但是，在这一次却好像变了样了。有伟大的斯大林的遗体安睡在这儿，那是宇宙虽大都仿佛无法包容的遗体，而参拜的人流又在这里汇集成了海洋，这就会使得任何宏敞的殿堂都要相形着变得狭隘了。
    斯大林的遗体安睡在不很高的一段平台上，台是临时性的，在圆柱大厅中的横长一侧的正中处。苏联国徽和各加盟共和国国徽的红色锦旗悬挂在四周，形成了一个正方形的灵堂。平台两侧的正中央，各有两位武装同志相向守卫，挨次便是守灵的吊唁者。
    有庄严的音乐在左侧固有的高台上演奏着。
    我们捧着一个大花圈，跟随着周总理，走到了灵前。献了花圈，站立着行了最敬礼，静默了三分钟。眼泪又禁不住汹涌了起来。
    敬礼完毕后，被导引着从右手绕过遗体后面，走进了一间休息室里。在这里我们受到治丧委员会雅斯诺夫委员的招待，看到了库兹涅佐夫外交部副部长，看到了曾经两次来中国讲学的尤金院士，也看到了布琼尼元帅和其他赶来守灵的元帅们。
    等了不一会，轮到我们守灵的班次了。我们又被引导着，走到遗体的右侧，六个人一组，分成前后两列，紧接着守卫的武装同志，面对面肃立着，进行三分钟的守灵。
    穿着大元帅服的斯大林的遗体静静地仰卧着，闭着眼睛。遗容是那么地肃穆、和蔼，仿佛还在呼息。平放在腿上的两手，也仿佛还有脉搏在皮下跳动。我是最后握过那温暖的手的一个中国人，那手上的温暖不是依然还留在我的手上吗？
    在去年一月十三号的晚上，斯大林曾经接见过宋庆龄副主席和我。
    那是在克里姆林宫的斯大林的办公室，一间素朴、庄重、静穆的长方形房间。房对侧右手角上斜放着一张办公桌，桌上堆满着文件。左手角上是一座旧式的大壁炉。挨近壁炉的地方有一道侧门，大约是通往内室的。
    内侧壁上并排着四位历史人物：帝俄名将苏沃洛夫和库图佐夫的油画像、马克思和列宁的照片。此外，全室中没有别的装饰，地板上也没有地毯。
    在人物像下边，和壁面平行，有一张长餐桌，敷着绿色的呢桌面。餐桌的这一头，靠着进门处的左手壁次有一架高大的座钟，时针是指着十点一刻的。斯大林是非常地健康的，穿的是栗色呢子的列宁服，浅蓝色的衬衫。完全像对待家里人一样，他和我们握了手。他坐在苏沃洛夫元帅的像下，对着我们讲了将近两小时的话。他是那样的平静、爽直，没有丝毫的矜持和客套。以他那样伟大的人，在人类历史上开辟出了一个新纪元，对于人类有了那么深厚的惠泽的人，使你坐在他的面前，一点也不感觉着拘束，而又油然地由衷生出亲近和崇敬的念头，受着不期然而然的感化。
    他对于中国人民是有着衷心的关切的。他向我们问到解放后的中国人民的生活感情、中国妇女的工作概况、初级教育和高等教育的发展程度、汉字改革的问题，为少数民族创制文字的问题。
    他说：中国人是好人，勤劳、朴实，帝国主义者想把中国人变成坏人，但还没有来得及。
    他希望中国妇女能够发挥伟大的潜在力量。他希望中国青年除重视技术科学之外，也要注重教育的学习，博得做人民教师的光荣。
    他对于和平运动也特别关心，叫我们从事和平运动的人要努力争取有发动侵略战争危险的那些国家的人民广泛地来从事维护和平的事业。从事和平运动的人要有高度的自我牺牲精神，要像法国的一位少女那样，她为反对运输军火到越南，躺在铁轨上阻止火车的前进。
      他娓娓不倦地向我们提出了不少的问题，也为我们解答了不少的问题。我们是舍不得离开他的，但是怕他疲劳了，就只得告辞。
    他最后依然不矜持地说出了这样一句话：“你们要使我疲劳是很不容易的。”
    斯大林最后和我们握别了。——我是最后握了他的温暖的手的一个中国人，但仅仅相隔五十来天，依然还在我手上的斯大林的温暖谁能相信不依然还在斯大林的手上呢？
      九号是举行葬礼的一天。这一天莫斯科的天气特别阴晦，整个的天空就好像笼罩着了一层黑纱。
    天很冷，有点北风。时而飘着些雪片。
    周恩来总理在八点钟先到工会大厦护灵去了，我们其余的人在九点钟都往红场参加葬仪。我们到达红场的时候，观礼的人差不多已经把观礼台站满了，我们只得选到比较高的层次上去站立着。
      “真理报”译载了毛主席的“最伟大的友谊”，文章上面登着一九五○年二月中苏友好同盟互助条约签字时，斯大林、毛泽东和马林科夫所合照的相片。观礼台上的人，可以看出处处都在展读着这篇文章。
    在十点半钟左右哀乐的声音传入了红场，人们都掉头望着历史博物馆旁边的红场的进口，全宇宙都森严起来了，人们屏息着，除了有哀乐之外，没有任何声音。由工会大厦出发的葬仪行列应着哀乐的节拍，慢慢地走进了红场。先头是花圈，其次是高级将领们捧着载在红色天鹅绒垫子上的斯大林生前所获得的勋章和奖章。
    六匹纯黑的马拖着炮车上的斯大林的灵柩，斯大林的遗容通过水晶棺盖仰向天空，和莫斯科市民、苏联各民族的代表、世界各民族的代表见面了。全场都脱了帽，在风雪中默哀，很多人在流眼泪。
    灵柩到列宁墓前——现在的列宁墓在前楣上已经改刻为“列宁——斯大林”了——面对着墓门，停放在红场的正中心。跟在灵柩后面护送的苏联政府领袖们，各兄弟国家兄弟党的领袖们都陆续登上了墓台。
    追悼大会开始了。
    宏亮而有力的声音，就好像从斯大林的口里发出的一样，响透了红场，响透了整个世界。全场肃静地倾听了苏联共产党中央委员会书记、苏联部长会议主席马林科夫的报告。
    在将近十二点钟的时候报告完毕了，领袖们走下墓台，把斯大林的灵柩抬进陵墓，和列宁的遗体并列。
    礼炮轰动了全场，轰动了整个阴晦的天空。
    苏联的国歌嘹亮地演奏了出来。
    葬礼临到结束的阶段了，领袖们又登上了墓台，苏联的元帅们和将军们也都登上了墓台。
    参加葬礼的莫斯科卫戍部队整队走过墓前向斯大林告别，超音速的飞机编队从墓顶上空飞过。百战百胜、保卫和平建设的钢铁战士们，在社会主义建设中获得伟大成就的苏联人民的代表们，接连着从墓前走过，具体地表现出要把深沉的悲痛转化而为更伟大的力量。
    斯大林同志逝世转瞬已经一周年了。我回忆起参加斯大林葬礼的情形仍旧像在眼面前一样。
    一年以前，当全世界善良的人民因为斯大林逝世而在心中激起了深切的悲痛的时候，在美英帝国主义集团里面，曾经有一小撮顽恶的战争挑拨者是怀抱着幸灾乐祸的心情的。他们幻想苏联的力量可能因此而受影响。他们幻想以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的团结会因此而松懈。他们幻想世界和平运动会因此而削弱。但是，这些卑劣的幻想，很快地都被事实彻底粉碎了。
    一年以来，我们确实地把这深重的悲痛化为了伟大的力量。苏联共产党和苏联政府领导着苏联人民，继续巩卫了并且发展了列宁斯大林的事业。在向共产主义前进的事业中继续获得了光辉的成就。以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的团结力量继续巩固和强大了。世界和平斗争在东方和西方继续取得了伟大的胜利。
    我们中国人民和苏联人民的伟大友谊也继续加强起来了。中国共产党和毛泽东主席，根据由马克思、恩格斯所创立而由列宁、斯大林所发展起来的从资本主义到社会主义过渡的理论，并根据我国的具体情况，提出了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，这已经成为照耀我们一切工作的灯塔。我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业也已经有了进一步的发展。
    斯大林是极关心中国的建设事业的。在我们纪念斯大林逝世一周年的时候，我们应该更好地学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，更好地学习苏联建设社会主义的经验，努力生产，努力工作，提高社会主义觉悟，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，团结一致，为着把我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而共同奋斗。
    斯大林是巩固世界和平的永恒的旗帜。在我们纪念斯大林逝世一周年的时候，我们应该更进一步地加强中国人民和苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊，加强人民民主兄弟国家之间的友好合作，我们将和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致，为反对帝国主义的侵略战争，为缓和国际紧张局势，为保卫亚洲和平与世界和平而共同奋斗。
    共产主义万岁！
    和平万岁！（附图片）
