    Give Full Play to the Role of Local State-Owned Industry in the Transition Period
    Local state-owned industries in our country account for a large proportion of the national economy. According to incomplete statistics, the total output value of local state-owned industries expected to be completed last year accounted for 14.29 percent of the total national industrial output value and 27.81 percent of the total state-owned industrial output value. In the total output value of local state-owned industries, more than 70 percent are consumer goods for the needs of urban and rural people, especially farmers, and nearly 30 percent are means of production for agriculture and to cooperate with state-owned enterprises in production and capital construction. In the process of our country's economic recovery and development, local state-owned industries have played a significant role as a powerful assistant to state-owned industries.
    The development and growth of local state-owned industry is an indispensable part of the socialist industrialization cause. In 1925, Comrade Stalin pointed out when talking about the issue of national industrialization: "We must not concentrate our efforts solely on developing industries of an all-Union nature, because the industries of an all-Union nature, our centralized trusts and syndicates, cannot satisfy the various requirements and tastes of 140 million people. In order to meet these needs, it is necessary to make the industrial life of every region, every county, every province, every state, and every national republic boil. If we do not develop the potential power that each locality has accumulated in economic construction, if we do not do our best to help the local industries everywhere, from the regions and states, if we do not develop all these forces, we cannot achieve the kind of universal upsurge in our country's economic construction that Lenin spoke of." (From Stalin's Summing Up Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the 14th Congress of the CPSU (B)). Comrade Stalin's instruction is equally applicable to our country's current situation. Because during our country's transition period, the state's power is mainly concentrated on developing heavy industry; in terms of light industry, state-owned industry can only focus on solving the most important products. As our country's industrial and agricultural production develops day by day, and the lives of urban and rural people improve day by day, the society's demand for various consumer goods will inevitably increase day by day; at the same time, our country has a vast territory, a large population, and many ethnic groups, and the living habits of people in different regions are different, and the consumer goods they need are also diverse and regional in nature. If we only rely on the national state-owned light industry, without making the local state-owned industries in various provinces and counties universally active, we will not be able to meet the various requirements and tastes of more than 500 million people in terms of the quantity and variety of products.
    Secondly, with the implementation of large-scale socialist transformation in agriculture, and with the change of production relations in agriculture, we must correspondingly improve the material and technical conditions of agricultural production and expand the scale of the supply of agricultural means of production. To this end, the state has stipulated in the construction plan to build huge tractor factories and new factories for manufacturing chemical fertilizers. However, these newly built large factories need a considerable number of years to put into production, and it is impossible for us to build many such factories at present to fully meet the needs of agricultural production across the country all at once. At the same time, due to the different geographical environments in various parts of our country, the requirements for means of production are diverse. Taking new-style plows as an example, there must be those suitable for dry land in the north and those suitable for paddy fields in the south; those suitable for plains and those suitable for mountains. The state-built giant agricultural machinery factories cannot fully meet all kinds of needs. Therefore, the task of supplying various improved agricultural tools, implements, and other simpler agricultural production tools at present, and cooperating with large national factories to supply various regional agricultural tools in the future, mainly relies on local state-owned industries. This division of labor is completely appropriate and necessary.
    Thirdly, in the process of gradually realizing national socialist industrialization, the state needs to carry out many new and renovated projects, all of which require a large amount of bricks, tiles, sand, stone, small hardware, and other building materials. These building materials are used in large quantities, are relatively simple to manufacture, and the raw materials are mostly taken from the local area, making it most suitable for production by local state-owned industries. After the state's new large factories are built, especially in the new industrial zones, we also need some "satellite factories" surrounding state-owned enterprises to process and manufacture spare parts and accessories for state-owned enterprises and utilize their large amounts of waste products. These types of factories should also be mainly operated by local authorities.
    It can be seen that the tasks undertaken by local state-owned industries in the transition period are very important, and the development prospects of local state-owned industries are very broad. Some people now believe that local state-owned industries can only play a role during the economic recovery period, and have no future during the construction period. This idea is unfounded.
    Of course, local state-owned industries should not develop blindly, but should be in line with and adapt to the state's overall plan for industrial development. The guiding principle for the production and development of local state-owned industries must be to serve the lives and production of the local people and to serve the local state-owned enterprises. Except for a small number of industries whose production characteristics or original economic foundation limit the supply and marketing issues to be resolved nationwide, general enterprises must abide by the principle of "taking materials locally, manufacturing locally, and promoting sales locally"; and achieve a balance under the overall national production and distribution plan. This is a fundamental link that determines whether local state-owned industries can be run well, can play a role, and have development prospects. Some of our local state-owned enterprises have achieved good results by following this principle. For example, the Liaocheng Iron Factory in Shandong Province not only makes agricultural tools, but also makes household utensils, and not only manufactures, but also engages in repairs and fittings, so its business is very good. The Wendeng Ship Repair Factory serves fishermen in the peak season and farmers in the off-season, and sends people to the countryside to promote products, and its business is also very good. On the contrary, some leading cadres of local state-owned enterprises, divorced from the local economic development situation, blindly build and expand factories, and as a result, after some factories are built, their equipment cannot be fully utilized or even cannot be put into production at all due to insufficient raw materials or lack of sales channels. Some factories do not consider market needs, do not pay attention to improving quality and reducing costs, and blindly produce, resulting in product backlog and only relying on bank loans to survive. More seriously, the leading cadres of these enterprises do not analyze the real reasons for this situation, but instead say that the product backlog is due to "low market purchasing power" and "overproduction," complaining that local state-owned industries are too diverse, have too many products, are small in scale, have old equipment, factories are scattered, and are difficult to manage, and want to "shrink" a bit, canceling the small and "broken" ones and only engaging in large and new ones. They do not understand that although local state-owned industries are more difficult to manage due to the above-mentioned characteristics, it is precisely because of these characteristics that local state-owned industries can adapt to the local, especially rural, economic situation, and can adapt to local conditions, take materials locally, manufacture locally, and sell locally, meet the diverse needs of the people, and make up for the role that state-owned industries cannot play. It is not appropriate or possible to ignore these characteristics, look down on existing enterprises, and only want to build new large factories. Because in the transition period, especially in the early stage of construction, the state must concentrate its main efforts on developing heavy industry. At this time, if local state-owned industries also carry out large-scale construction, it will disperse the state's human, material, and financial resources and delay the construction of heavy industry that determines the country's fate.
    In order to give full play to the role of local state-owned enterprises, the current key is to pay great attention to giving full play to the potential power of existing equipment. The potential power in existing local state-owned industries is great, and the equipment capacity has not been fully utilized. For example, in the Central and Southern District, the average equipment utilization rate of the entire sugar industry is only 60 percent, and the coal industry is only 50 percent; the equipment utilization rates of several major industries in Henan Province are: textile 82.2 percent, oil 63 percent, flour 58.9 percent, and electricity 35.29 percent. The equipment utilization rate of Anhui Cotton Weaving Factory is only 54.42 percent, and matches is 21.16 percent. The situation in other regions is similar. Among the above-mentioned products, except for individual products that are temporarily affected by raw materials or the market, the general equipment capacity is insufficient. Therefore, in a considerable period of time in the future, local state-owned industries should focus on running existing enterprises well and giving full play to the potential capacity of existing enterprises.
    The outstanding problems in the management of local state-owned industries are: low product quality and high costs. There are many reasons for this situation, the main one is that many enterprise leading cadres do not have the management concept of economic accounting, products rely on national distribution and guaranteed sales, funds rely on bank loans, coupled with the conservative idea of being satisfied with the status quo, feeling that the equipment of local state-owned industries is bad, the technical level of workers is low, and it is impossible to improve quality. Therefore, they do not try to improve the operation and management of enterprises. Many factories lack the necessary technical management, and still do not have operating procedures, no quality standards, and no inspection systems; no one is responsible for defective products; many enterprises have huge institutions, many management personnel, and large non-production expenditures. According to statistics from 195 local state-owned factories in Shandong Province, only seven factories have management personnel accounting for less than 10 percent of the total number of employees; 50 factories account for 10 to 20 percent; and 138 factories account for 20 to more than 50 percent. There are many management personnel, large administrative management fees, and therefore high product costs. At the same time, due to neglecting economy, the waste of raw materials is also very large. These situations show that local state-owned industries must correct their leadership thinking, strengthen management work, and conscientiously ensure that high-quality and low-priced products are supplied to the people and our national enterprises.
    In addition, in order to give full play to the strength of existing local industries, the local party committees and financial and economic leading organs must also take into account the production capacity of local joint state-private enterprises and private enterprises when considering the production and development plans of local state-owned industries, and organize them carefully, so that under the unified national plan, the strength of local joint state-private enterprises and private enterprises can be brought into play to supplement the shortcomings of local state-owned industries; at the same time, waste and unreasonable phenomena such as unbalanced equipment or overlapping production in the region can be avoided.
    The tasks undertaken by local state-owned industries in the transition period are very important. Local party committees and financial and economic leading organs must strengthen their leadership over local state-owned industries, strengthen the education of enterprise cadres, make them realize the importance of local state-owned industries, rely on all employees to work hard to improve management, and strengthen the political work of enterprises. Only in this way can local state-owned industries fully play their role in the transition period.

### 充分发挥地方国营工业在过渡时期的作用

    充分发挥地方国营工业在过渡时期的作用
    我国地方国营工业在国民经济中占有很大的比重。根据不完全的统计，去年地方国营工业预计完成的总产值占全国工业总产值的百分之十四点二九，占国营工业总产值的百分之二十七点八一。在地方国营工业的生产总值中，有百分之七十以上是供应城乡人民，特别是农民所需的生活资料，将近百分之三十是供应农业和配合国营企业进行生产和基本建设的生产资料。在我国经济的恢复和发展过程中，地方国营工业作为国营工业的有力助手，发挥了很大的作用。
    地方国营工业的发展和壮大，是社会主义工业化事业中不可缺少的部分。一九二五年斯大林同志在谈到国家工业化的问题时，就曾指出：“我们决不能单只集中力量来发展全苏联性质的工业，因为全苏联性质的工业，我们集中化的托辣斯和新迪加，决不能满足一亿四千万人民方面的各种要求和口味。为要满足这些需要，便必须使每一区、每一府、每一省、每一州、每一民族共和国内的工业生活沸腾起来。若不开展各地方在经济建设方面所蕴蓄的潜在力量，若不尽量帮助各处从各区和各州起的地方工业，若不来发展所有这一切力量，我们便不能达到我国经济建设中如列宁所说过的那种普遍高涨。”
  （在联共（布）第十四次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告）。斯大林同志的这一指示，同样适合于我国现在的情况。因为我国在过渡时期中，国家的力量主要集中于发展重工业；在轻工业方面，国营工业只能着重解决最主要的产品。而随着我国工农业生产的日益发展，城乡人民生活的日益改善，社会上对各种生活资料的需要必将日益增加；同时我国幅员广阔，人口和民族众多，各地人民生活习惯不同，所需要的生活资料也是多种多样，富于地区性的。如果我们只依靠全国性的国营轻工业，而不使各省各县的地方国营工业普遍活跃起来，就不能在产品的数量上、品种上满足五亿多人民的各种要求和口味。
    其次，随着农业中大规模的社会主义改造的实施，随着农业中生产关系的改变，我们必须相应地改善农业生产的物质技术条件，扩大农业生产资料供应的规模。为此，国家在建设计划中已规定了要修建巨大的拖拉机工厂和新的制造化学肥料的工厂。但是，这些新建的大工厂需要相当年限才能投入生产，我们也不可能在目前兴建许多这样的工厂，一下子使全国农业生产的需要全部得到满足。同时，由于我国各地的地理环境不同，对生产资料的要求是多种多样的。就以新式步犁来说，要有适于北方旱地用的，又要有适于南方水田用的；要有适于平原用的，又要有适于山地用的。国家建设的巨型农业机械工厂，也不可能完全满足各种各样的需要。因此，在目前供应各种改良农具、药械以及其它较简单的农业生产工具，在将来配合国家大型工厂供应各种各样具有地区性的农具的任务，就主要依靠地方国营工业来负担。这种分工，是完全应当的和必需的。
    再次，在逐步实现国家社会主义工业化的过程中，国家要进行许多新建和改建的工程，这些工程都需要大量的砖、瓦、砂、石、小五金等等建筑材料。这些建筑材料用量很大，制造比较简单，原料大都取自当地，由地方国营工业来生产最为适宜。在国家新的大工厂建设起来以后，特别是在新的工业区，我们还需要有一些围绕着国营企业，为国营企业加工制造备品和附件以及利用其大量废品等等的“卫星工厂”。这类工厂主要地也应由地方来经营。
    由此可见，地方国营工业在过渡时期中担负的任务是十分重大的，地方国营工业的发展前途是十分广阔的。现在有些人认为地方国营工业只在经济恢复时期能发挥一些作用，在建设时期就没有前途了。这种想法是毫无根据的。
    当然，地方国营工业也不应该盲目发展，而应与国家发展工业的总计划相配合、相适应。地方国营工业生产发展的方针，必须是为当地人民的生活和生产服务，为当地的国营企业服务。除一部分产业因本身生产的特点或原有经济基础限定必须在全国范围内解决供销问题外，一般的企业都必须遵守“就地取材、就地制造、就地推销”的原则；并在全国总的生产与分配计划下取得平衡。这是决定地方国营工业能否办好，能不能发挥作用，有没有发展前途的根本一环。我们有一些地方国营企业按照这样的方针办事，已取得了很好的成绩。例如山东聊城铁工厂，不仅做农具，也做生活用具，不仅制造，还兼营修配，因此营业情况很好。文登修船厂旺季为渔民服务，淡季为农民服务，并派人下乡推销产品，营业情况也很好。与此相反，有一些地方国营企业的领导干部，脱离当地的经济发展状况，盲目地去新建和扩建工厂，结果有的工厂建成之后，因原料不足或缺乏销路，以致设备不能充分运用，甚至根本不能开工生产。有的工厂不考虑市场需要情况，不注意提高质量和降低成本，一味盲目生产，以致产品积压，只能依靠银行贷款度日。更严重的是，这些企业的领导干部不去分析造成这种状况的真正原因，反而说产品积压是由于“市场购买力不高”、“生产过剩”，埋怨地方国营工业行业杂、产品多、规模小、设备旧、工厂分散、不好管理，想“收缩”一下，把小的、“破的”取消，专搞大的和新的。他们不了解，地方国营工业虽然因为上述特点，在管理上比较困难，但也正因为有这些特点，地方国营工业才能够和当地的、特别是农村的经济情况相适应，能够因地制宜、就地取材、就地制造、就地销售，满足人民多种多样的要求，补足国营工业所不能发挥的作用。如果忽视这些特点，看不起现有企业，一心只想建设新的大的工厂，这是不应当的，也是不可能的。因为在过渡期中，特别是在建设初期，国家要集中主要的力量发展重工业，在这个时候，如果地方国营工业也要进行大规模建设，就会分散国家的人力、物力和财力，使决定国家命运的重工业建设推迟。
    为了发挥地方国营企业的作用，目前的关键在于十分注意发挥现有设备的潜在力量。现有地方国营工业中的潜在力量很大，设备能力还没有充分发挥。例如中南区全区制糖业的设备利用率平均只有百分之六十，煤业只有百分之五十；河南省几种主要工业的设备利用率是：纺织百分之八十二点二，油脂百分之六十三，面粉百分之五十八点九，电业百分之三十五点二九。安徽省棉织厂的设备利用率只达百分之五十四点四二，火柴百分之二十一点一六。其他地区的情况也差不多。上述产品中，除个别产品暂时受原料或市场影响外，一般的设备能力都是发挥不足的。所以，地方国营工业在今后相当长的时期内，应该把重点放在搞好现有企业，充分发挥现有企业的潜在能力方面。
    现在地方国营工业在经营管理上存在着的突出问题是：产品质量低，成本高。造成这种状况的原因很多，主要的则是由于不少企业的领导干部没有经济核算的经营思想，产品依赖国家分配包销，资金依靠银行贷款，再加上满足现状的保守思想，觉得地方国营工业设备坏，工人技术水平低，提高质量是不可能的。因此他们就不去努力改善企业的经营管理。有许多工厂，缺乏必要的技术管理，至今还没有操作规程，没有质量标准，没有检验制度；出了废品、次品没有人负责；许多企业机构庞大，管理人员多，非生产开支大。根据山东省一百九十五个地方国营工厂统计，管理人员占职工总数百分之十以下的只有七个厂；占百分之十至二十的有五十个厂；占百分之二十至五十以上的有一百三十八个厂。管理人员多，行政管理费便大，因而产品成本便高。同时，由于忽视节约，在原材料方面的浪费也是很大的。这些情况说明，地方国营工业必须端正领导思想，加强经营管理工作，切实做到把质好价廉的产品供应给人民和我们的国家企业。
    此外，为了充分发挥现有地方工业的力量，各地党委和财政经济领导机关，在考虑地方国营工业的生产计划和发展计划时，还必须把地方公私合营企业和私营企业的生产能力计算进去，并加以周密的组织，以便在国家统一计划下，发挥地方公私合营企业和私营企业的力量，使之补助地方国营工业之不足；同时，又可以避免地区内设备不平衡或生产重叠等浪费和不合理现象。
    地方国营工业在过渡时期所担负的任务是十分重大的。各地党委和财经领导机关必须加强对地方国营工业的领导，加强对企业干部进行教育，使他们认识地方国营工业的重要性，依靠全体职工努力改善经营管理，并加强企业的政治工作。只有这样，才能使地方国营工业充分发挥它在过渡时期的作用。
