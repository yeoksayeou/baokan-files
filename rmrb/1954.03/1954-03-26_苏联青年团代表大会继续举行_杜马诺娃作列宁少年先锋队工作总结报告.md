Giving the best to children has become the law of life for Soviet people. The material living conditions of Soviet families are constantly improving, and they have excellent conditions for educating children. The state allocates a large amount of funds every year to develop education and culture. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has built a total of 11,000 schools, many children's palaces, children's homes and other cultural and welfare institutions. Millions of literary books and popular science readings have been published for children. The state and trade unions have also allocated large amounts of funds to organize summer vacation activities for primary and secondary school students. Last year, more than four million children spent their holidays in youth camps in the suburbs or urban areas of various cities. The Young Pioneer organization has become the most important factor in carrying out communist education for children. Dumanova also talked about how the Young Pioneer organization cares about the academic performance of the Young Pioneers in schools, how to increase their knowledge, how to educate students to love labor, and how to cultivate them to possess the noble moral qualities of Soviet people.

    Those who spoke during the discussion included counselors from Young Pioneer teams from various places, children's education workers, and leading cadres of Komsomol organizations from various places.
