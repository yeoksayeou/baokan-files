Liaodong Department Store of the China Department Store Liaoning Provincial Company previously held "famous brand" thinking, and did not actively promote local state-owned industrial products, resulting in the accumulation of some products and market shortages. Some factories had to sell on their own, causing market chaos. For example, the artificial fur produced by the Liaodong Province Tussah Silk Weaving Company's Silk Spinning Factory was of good quality. At first, the department store was afraid that sales would not be large, so it did not actively promote it. Later, after the Silk Spinning Factory opened up sales in Guannei (inside the Shanhaiguan Pass) on its own, the department store was dissatisfied and restricted the Silk Spinning Factory from supplying artificial fur to Guannei.

After studying the general line for the transition period of the state, the staff of Liaodong Provincial Department Store corrected their policy thinking, conducted a survey of local state-owned industrial production in January, and initially grasped the production situation of local state-owned industry, which greatly improved the integration of production and sales. In the first quarter of this year, the total value of orders for local state-owned industries reached 13.1 billion yuan, opening up sales for local state-owned industrial products such as Changbai toothpaste, Changbai cream, and Golden Dragon gold pens. In the past, leather products such as leather shoes and various leather balls, which had high costs and low quality, were actively suggested by the department store to improve production, and the production units also improved product quality and reduced costs.

In order to correct the "famous brand" mentality, Liaodong Provincial Department Store held a provincial materials exchange conference on February 10, and at the same time held a local state-owned industrial product exhibition room. Through this exhibition, department stores in various cities and counties further clarified the idea of actively opening up sales for local state-owned industrial products and closely integrating production and sales. These facts educated the department stores in various cities and counties, and clearly recognized that local state-owned industrial products were not without sales, nor were they of low quality, but that they had not actively opened up sales for local state-owned industrial products.

In order to further promote the integration of production and sales in the province, Liaodong Provincial Department Store is preparing to continue to do the following tasks: First, strengthen the processing and ordering of local industries (including local state-owned industries and private industries), deeply understand the situation, and promptly put forward opinions on improving product quality to the industrial departments through production and sales meetings to help industrial departments further improve product quality; Second, strengthen investigation and research, grasp the changing laws of people's needs, and put forward suggestions to the industrial departments on time according to needs and possibilities, give play to the role of influencing production and guiding consumption, overcome the blindness of production, and accelerate capital turnover; Third, carefully sign and implement production and sales contracts, and gradually achieve accurate formulation of production and sales plans and strict implementation of production and sales contracts; Fourth, establish a local state-owned industrial product exhibition room in the province to assess and compare product quality, and urge industrial departments to improve product quality, so as to achieve the purpose of developing production and meeting needs.

    辽东百货公司积极推销地方国营工业产品
    中国百货公司辽东省公司过去存在着“名牌货”思想，不积极推销地方国营工业产品，曾发生某些产品积压、而市场脱销现象。某些工厂不得不自行销售；造成市场紊乱。例如辽东省柞蚕丝织公司绢纺厂生产的人造毛皮质量很好，起初百货公司怕销路不大，不积极推销，后来绢纺厂自己在关内打开了销路后，百货公司又不满意，限制绢纺厂以人造毛皮供应关内。
    学习国家过渡时期总路线以后，辽东省百货公司职工端正了政策思想，在一月份进行了地方国营工业生产调查，初步掌握了地方国营工业的生产情况，使产销结合有了很大改进。今年一季度地方国营工业的订货总值达一百三十一亿元，给长白牙膏、长白霜、金龙金笔等地方国营工业产品打开了销路；过去成本高、质量低的皮革制品——皮鞋、各种皮球等，经百货公司积极提出改进生产的建议，生产单位也提高了产品质量，降低了成本。
    为了纠正“名牌货”思想，辽东省百货公司在二月十日举行了全省物资交流大会，同时举办了地方国营工业产品展览室。通过这次展览，使各市县百货公司进一步明确了积极为地方国营工业产品打开销路，密切产销结合思想。这些事实，教育了各市县百货公司，明确认识了地方国营工业产品不是没销路，也不是质量低，而是没有积极为地方国营工业产品打开销路。
    为进一步促进省内的产销结合，辽东省百货公司准备继续做好以下几项工作：一、加强对地方工业（包括地方国营工业和私营工业）的加工订货，深入了解情况，通过产销会议及时向工业部门提出有关改进产品质量等方面的意见，帮助工业部门进一步提高产品质量；二、加强调查研究，掌握人民需要的变化规律，根据需要和可能按时向工业部门提出建议，发挥影响生产、指导消费的作用，克服生产的盲目性，加速资金周转；三、认真签订和执行产销合同，逐步做到准确地制订产销计划，严格执行产销合同；四、建立省内地方国营工业产品展览室，以考核和比较产品质量，督促工业部门提高产品质量，达到发展生产，满足需要的目的。
