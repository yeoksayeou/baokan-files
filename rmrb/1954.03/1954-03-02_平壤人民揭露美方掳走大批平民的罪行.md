Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th: Residents of Pyongyang have revealed to reporters the brutal crimes of the US and Syngman Rhee's troops in forcibly abducting large numbers of civilians.

In early December 1950, as the US and Syngman Rhee troops retreated south in disarray under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, they used deception, threats, and coercion to abduct large numbers of civilians in the Pyongyang area. Kim In-soo, who lives in Girim 1-dong, Pyongyang, accused the enemy's "Political Training Bureau" (note: belonging to the US CIC intelligence system) of posting notices in the city, saying that "the Communists will kill all peaceful residents," "those who do not follow the Allied forces south are Red elements," and "the Allied forces will drop an atomic bomb immediately after withdrawing from Pyongyang." Members of the enemy's "Security Force" also spread rumors among the citizens and used weapons to coerce and abduct large numbers of civilians. Kim In-soo said, "On December 4th, a large number of citizens were forced to go south, and I was one of them. When we crossed the Daedong River via the humanitarian bridge, more than 30 US fighter planes continuously bombed and strafed us, and the Daedong River was filled with corpses and blood. Civilians who were forced to cross the river at Pyeongcheon-ri were in small boats with too many people, and many fell into the river and drowned. As far as I know, more than 100,000 civilians were taken from Pyongyang to Haeju in Hwanghae Province. More than 400 people were abducted from Girim 1-dong alone. The enemy said they would transport us from Haeju to Incheon and Ganghwa Island by boat, but when we arrived in Haeju, there were no boats, so they forced us to continue south by land. We didn't want to leave our hometowns, and many people secretly fled back north along the way. But by December 25th, around Gaenampho-ri and Jangdan, north of the Imjin River, about 70,000 civilians were still in the clutches of the enemy. I personally saw more than 40 acquaintances (my hometown is Unsan, North Pyongan Province) also forced to cross the river south. At this time, enemy planes bombed and strafed us again, and Syngman Rhee's puppet army and puppet police robbed us of our property. I escaped and returned home after arriving in the Seoul area. My companions, hungry and cold, were taken to various parts of South Korea."

Yoon Gyu-tae, a farmer from Jangjeong-ri, Dong District, Pyongyang, was unjustly imprisoned by the enemy in Dongpyongyang prison during the enemy's occupation of Pyongyang. He accused, "On the morning of December 4, 1950, when Pyongyang was about to be liberated, the enemy gathered about 300 residents imprisoned in this prison and marched them south. Along the way, we saw lines of abducted residents. Many sick people and children were also forced to walk. I risked escaping home after reaching Junghwa County. My small village had 30 households and more than 140 people, but only 13 people were left at that time; the rest were forcibly abducted by the puppet security forces. My younger brother hid in the cowshed covered with thick straw and was not abducted. Although some people gradually escaped and returned later, many people in our village are still displaced in South Korea today. Their families think of their loved ones every day, longing for them to return home and live peaceful lives."

Liu Zhiwen, a farmer who was also abducted by the US and Syngman Rhee troops to the vicinity of Haeju before finding an opportunity to escape, said, "At least more than one million displaced civilians were abducted to South Korea. Taking one village, Samjeong-ri in Junghwa County, as an example, all the residents of the village, about 500 people, were abducted at that time, and less than 30 percent of the residents later risked escaping and returning. During the journey south, enemy planes deliberately bombed us, and enemy troops killed, threatened, and robbed us wantonly. The large number of displaced civilians abducted to various parts of South Korea certainly hope to return home. The Syngman Rhee gang's claim that only 70 people have registered to return home is the most shameless lie. We firmly demand that the US abide by the armistice agreement and allow our brothers and sisters to return home, reunite with their families, and live a peaceful and prosperous life."

    平壤人民揭露美方掳走大批平民的罪行
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】平壤市人民向记者揭发美李匪军强迫掳走大批平民的残暴罪行。
      一九五零年十二月初，美李匪军在朝中人民军队的沉重打击下自平壤地区狼狈南逃时，曾对平壤地区居民用尽欺骗、威胁和强迫手段，掳走了大批平民。住在平壤市箕林一洞的金仁洙控诉说：平壤光复前夕，敌军“政训局”（按：属美方CIC特务系统）在市内贴出布告，说什么“共军一到将杀尽和平居民”，“不跟随联军南移就是赤色分子”，
  “联军退出平壤，立即投原子弹”。敌“治安队”队员并且在市民中大肆造谣，并且用武器威逼据掳大批市民。金仁洙说，十二月四日，大批市民被迫南走，我也是其中的一个。当我们通过大同江人道桥时，美军战斗机三十多架竟对我们连续进行轰炸和扫射，大同江上浮满了尸体和鲜血。被迫在平川里渡江的平民，人多船小，有不少人失足掉入江中淹死。据我所知，从平壤被押往黄海道海州的平民有十多万人。箕林一洞被掳走的就有四百多人。敌人本来说要把我们从海州用船只运到仁川、江华岛去，但到海州后没有船只，又迫使我们从陆路南下。我们不愿意离开家乡，一路上有许多人偷偷逃回北方。但是到二十五日在临津江北岸高浪浦里、长湍一带，还有七万左右的平民没有脱离虎口。我亲眼看见有熟识的四十多个乡亲（我的故乡在平安北道云山）也被迫渡江南去。这时，敌机又对我们肆行轰炸和扫射，李承晚伪军和伪警察等并抢劫了我们的财物。到汉城地区以后，我才脱身逃回。我的同伴们都饥寒交迫地被押解到南朝鲜各地去了。
    平壤东区将贞里农民尹奎泰，在敌人侵占平壤期间曾被敌人无端投入东平壤的监狱。他控诉说：“一九五零年十二月四日早晨平壤快解放时，敌人把监禁在这个监狱中的约三百名居民集合起来，向南押解。一路上，我们看到的尽是被掳走的居民的行列。有许多病人和儿童，也被迫赶路。到中和郡后我冒险脱逃回家。我住的小村子，有三十多户，一百四十多人，但当时只剩下十三个人，其余全被伪治安队强迫掳走了。我弟弟爬在牛棚里盖着厚厚的稻草，才没有被掳走。以后不久，虽然陆续有人逃回，但到今天我们村子还有许多人流离在南朝鲜。他们的家属天天都在想念着自己的亲人，渴望他们回家过和平生活。”
    农民刘志文当时也被美李匪军掳到海州附近才找到机会逃回，他说：“被掳到南朝鲜去的失所平民至少有一百多万人，拿中和郡三井里的一个村子来说，当时全村居民约五百人全被掳走，以后只有不到百分之三十的居民陆续冒险逃回。在南去的时候，敌机曾有意轰炸我们，敌军曾杀害、胁迫我们并滥肆抢劫。被掳到南朝鲜各地的大批失所平民当然都希望返乡。李承晚匪帮说只有七十人登记返乡，那是最无耻的谎话。我们坚决要求美方遵守停战协定，让我们的兄弟姊妹回来，和自己的家人团聚，过安居乐业的生活。”
