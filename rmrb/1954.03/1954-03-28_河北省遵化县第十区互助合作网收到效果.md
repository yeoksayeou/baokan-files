    The mutual aid and cooperation network established in the Tenth District of Zunhua County, Hebei Province, has achieved considerable results. In late January, the district established a Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement Guidance Committee, with the district party committee secretary and deputy secretary, as well as all district committee members participating. They were assigned to maintain fixed contact with the mutual aid and cooperation research committees in each township. The township's mutual aid and cooperation research committees were composed of township branch secretaries, committee members, and cooperative directors. Both the district and township committees held regular meetings to study issues in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    Since the establishment of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the district and townships have held two to three meetings each, resolving many issues. For example, at the first meeting in Gaogezhuang Township, many new cooperatives raised seven questions regarding "four fixings" (fixing labor, time, quantity, and quality), labor organization, and profit distribution. The township committee organized everyone to visit the Chen Tai Cooperative in Dongxiaozhai in a timely manner. At the visit, members of that cooperative introduced their experiences, resolving all the questions. For example, Gao Yuman Cooperative in Baimayu, Dongpu Township, proposed at a recent meeting that they needed a loan to buy sheep forage. Liang Tingxiu Cooperative in Dongpu Village, who attended the meeting, had sheep forage but lacked firewood. Gao Yuman Cooperative happened to have firewood, so the two cooperatives exchanged resources, eliminating the need for Gao Yuman Cooperative to take out a loan. Other townships had similar situations.

    Since the establishment of this organization, the unity between cooperatives has been strengthened, and older cooperatives have actively led the new cooperatives. For example, Yantun Township had three old cooperatives and three new cooperatives. After everyone's discussion, it was decided that one old cooperative would help one new cooperative. Some old cooperative directors even proactively went to the new cooperatives to ask what problems they had and helped them solve them. For example, the Wang Guofan Cooperative in Xisishilipu was an old cooperative. The methods established when the cooperative was founded, such as assessing property for shareholding, fixing land rent (based on normal annual production), and allocating excess production to labor, were very helpful to many new cooperatives. Many mutual aid team leaders also gained a lot of knowledge about how to run a cooperative from the research meetings, boosting their confidence. For example, some mutual aid team leaders in Jimingcun Township, after attending the meeting, went back and formulated a plan to strive to transform into a cooperative within a year. Two mutual aid teams in Xisishilipu recently proposed at a meeting that they had no carts to transport manure. The Wang Guofan Cooperative then sent two large carts to help them solve the difficulty of transporting manure.

    The Zunhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to the experience of the Tenth District, encouraging district and township cadres and cooperative directors to continue to create more mature experiences. Zhao Yongxing, Secretary of the Tenth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "We have decided to continue to uphold and consolidate this organization, and also to find out the problems that cooperatives may encounter in each season, and solve them, in order to obtain a more mature set of experiences."

    河北省遵化县第十区互助合作网收到效果
    河北省遵化县第十区建立的互助合作网，已收到不少成效。该区在一月下旬，以区为中心成立了互助合作运动指导委员会，区委正副书记和全体区委委员都参加，分工和各乡的互助合作研究委员会保持固定联系。乡的互助合作研究委员会由乡支部书记、委员和合作社主任组成。区和乡的委员会都定期开会，研究互助合作运动中的问题。
    互助合作网建立至今，区、乡都已开会二至三次，解决了不少问题。如高各庄乡第一次开会时，许多新社就提出有关进行“四定”（即定工、定时、定量、定质）、劳力组织、分红等七个问题，乡委员会组织大家及时参观了东小寨陈太社，在参观会上并由该社社员介绍了他们的经验，使全部问题获得解决。又如东铺乡白马峪的高玉满社在最近一次会上提出要贷款买羊草，参加会的东铺村梁庭秀社有羊草，却没柴火烧，高玉满社正好有柴，两社就互通有无，使高玉满社不再贷款。其他各乡也有类似情况。
    自从建立了这样一个组织后，社和社的团结加强了，老社都积极带领新社。如烟屯乡有老社三个、新社三个，经过大家研究，决定一个老社帮助一个新社。有的老社主任还主动到新社去问新社有什么问题，帮助解决。又如西四十里铺的王国藩社是老社，该社建社时所订的评产入股、固定地租
  （即以常年产量为标准）、超产归劳力等办法，对许多新社帮助很大。许多互助组长也从研究会上得到了许多如何办社的知识，提高了信心，如鸡鸣村乡有的互助组长参加会以后，就回去订出了一年之内争取转社的计划。西四十里铺有两个互助组最近因没有车送粪，在会上提出后，王国藩社就去了两辆大车帮助他们解决了送粪的困难。
    中共遵化县委会对十区的这个经验非常重视，鼓励区、乡干部和各合作社社长，继续创造更加成熟的经验。中共十区区委书记赵永兴同志说：“我们决定把这个组织继续坚持巩固下去，还要摸清各个季节中合作社可能发生的问题，加以解决，以便取得一套比较成熟的经验。”
