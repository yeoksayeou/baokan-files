    Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Finds a Way to Serve Agricultural Production
    Caused Dissatisfaction Among the Masses
    Last year during the spring plowing season, the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fujian Province received a lot of criticism from local farmers. One of the most prominent complaints was about the supply of bamboo hats.
    During the busy spring plowing season, it was drizzling every day. Farmers went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy bamboo hats to wear in the fields, but the cooperative only had umbrellas, not hats. The farmers were full of complaints, and some criticized the cooperative on the spot: "Are you telling us to hold umbrellas while working in the fields!"
    The farmers' complaints about the cooperative not supplying bamboo hats were reported to the county cooperative headquarters. The county headquarters inspected the supply work of various supply and marketing cooperatives and found many similar situations: farmers in the Fifth District wanted to buy bamboo mats, but the supply and marketing cooperative didn't have them; farmers in the Sixth District wanted to buy eight-foot-wide indigo cloth, but the supply and marketing cooperative didn't have it either... These many situations collectively reflected one problem: the supply and marketing cooperative must strengthen the supply of agricultural production materials and daily necessities based on the needs of the farmers.
      Organize Local Handicraft Production
    What do farmers need? How to meet the needs of farmers? These questions prompted the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to conduct investigations and studies of typical households. The investigation found that, due to the continuous development of agricultural production after liberation, many farmers began to buy fine cotton cloth and twill fabric to make clothes, and some farmers also bought wool, fountain pens, and thermos bottles. However, the majority of production materials and daily necessities needed by farmers were still general handicrafts. And these handicrafts could mostly be produced locally. "We must pay attention to organizing local handicraft production to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers," became a common conclusion among the cadres of the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative.
    How to organize local handicraft production? This was a new problem for the supply and marketing cooperative, which had been accustomed to "looking outward and reaching upward for help." In the first half of 1953, among the 186 commodities handled by the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, 158 were purchased from other places and higher-level cooperatives, accounting for 85 percent of all commodities, while only 15 percent were purchased locally. Now, to change this situation, it was necessary not only to clarify the significance of organizing local handicraft production ideologically among all cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative, but also to explore experience in specific practices.
    Organizing local handicraft production has its difficulties. Handicraft production is mostly decentralized individual production, with high mobility, uneven production in busy and slack seasons, and great changes in production capacity. The Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative first established close ties with local craftsmen in three different forms according to different situations. The first form was to absorb unemployed and semi-unemployed handicraft workers to organize handicraft processing factories. The second form was to entrust handicraft processing and order goods through the method of "supplying raw materials and collecting finished products." There were a total of 22 handicraft production groups organized through entrusted processing and ordering, including eight industries such as flour milling, cloth dyeing, bamboo ware, iron ware, and fine wood. The third form was to purchase products from handicraftsmen in a planned manner based on the production and sales situation of local handicrafts and the quantity, specifications, and quality requirements of farmers for handicraft products.
    In order to ensure that the products of the craftsmen met the requirements of the farmers, the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to the countryside to investigate the requirements of the farmers for the specifications and quality of various agricultural tools, as well as the time and quantity required. It also signed supply and marketing combination contracts with some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, specifically stipulating the specifications and time of handicraft products needed. Then, the supply and marketing cooperative signed contracts with the craftsmen according to the needs of the farmers, and organized the craftsmen to produce in a planned manner. After closely combining the needs of the farmers with the production of the craftsmen in this way, the blind phenomenon in production and sales was fundamentally changed.
    Another very important issue in organizing handicraft production is how to ensure product quality. Last year during the spring plowing season, the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized local craftsmen to process a batch of hoes. This batch of hoes was of very poor quality due to shoddy workmanship. The farmers said, "The hoe is made of foreign iron, it bends over before it's even used." As a result, more than 300 hoes were overstocked. They learned from this lesson and adopted the following four methods to ensure product quality: First, strengthen the ideological education of craftsmen, educating them to strive to improve quality and reduce costs; Second, entrust processing and order goods from craftsmen earlier to prevent craftsmen from making shoddy products due to rush work during the peak season; Third, hold symposiums to organize consumers to directly put forward opinions on improving product quality to producers; Fourth, encourage craftsmen to exchange experiences and learn production technology from each other. After these methods were implemented, product quality gradually improved.
    Received a Welcome from the Farmers
    After the Lianjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized local handicraft production, a new look appeared in the supply work. The supply of goods by the supply and marketing cooperative increased greatly. Last year, the total retail sales reached 44.89 billion yuan, exceeding the original plan by 101 percent. Among them, the retail sales in December increased by 3.4 billion yuan compared with January. This year's retail plan has been expanded compared with last year, and the supply plan for spring plowing farm tools has been expanded more than twice compared with last year. In addition, it has also helped craftsmen solve the difficulties in raw material procurement and finished product sales, gradually changed the phenomenon of uneven production in busy and slack seasons, and promoted craftsmen to organize and gradually realize the socialist transformation of handicrafts. At present, the broad masses of farmers in Lianjiang County's evaluation of the supply and marketing cooperative is: the cooperative is truly our own, understands what we need, and supplies us with what we need!

    连江县供销合作社找到了为农业生产服务的门路陈正邦
    引起了群众不满
    去年春耕的时候，福建省连江县供销合作社曾经受到当地农民不少批评，其中比较突出的是关于斗笠的事情。
    正当春耕大忙的季节，天天下着蒙蒙的细雨。农民们到供销合作社去买斗笠，准备下田，供销合作社却只有雨伞，没有斗笠。农民意见纷纷，有些人当场批评合作社：“难道叫我们撑着雨伞下田吗！”
    农民对合作社不供应斗笠的意见，反映到县合作总社。县合作总社检查了一下各个供销合作社的供应工作，发现了不少类似的情况：第五区农民要买竹席，供销合作社没有；第六区农民要买八丈蓝土布，供销合作社也没有……这许多情况集中地反映了一个问题：供销合作社必须根据农民的需要，加强农村生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。
      组织当地手工业生产
    农民需要什么？如何满足农民的需要呢？这些问题，推动连江县供销合作社普遍选择典型户进行了调查研究。调查中发现，由于解放后农业生产不断发展，许多农民开始选购龙头细布、斜纹布等做衣服，也有农民购买毛线、自来水笔、热水瓶等用品，但是农民需要的大部分生产资料和生活资料，还是一般的手工业品。而这些手工业品又多是当地手工业所能生产的。“必须注意组织当地手工业生产，来满足广大农民的需要”，成了连江县供销合作社干部的共同的结论。
    如何组织当地手工业生产呢？这对过去习惯于“眼睛往外看，伸手向上要”的供销合作社是一个新问题。一九五三年上半年，连江县供销合作社经营的一百八十六种商品中，从外地和上级社进货的有一百五十八种，占全部商品的百分之八十五，从当地进货的只占全部商品的百分之十五。现在要把这种状况改变过来，不但要求供销合作社全体干部从思想上明确认识组织当地手工业生产的意义，而且要求在具体作法上摸出经验来。
    组织当地手工业生产是有困难的。手工业生产大都是分散的个体生产，流动性很大，忙闲季生产不均，生产能力的变化也很大。连江县供销合作社首先分别不同情况，采取三种不同形式和当地手工业者建立了密切的联系。第一种形式是吸收当地失业、半失业的手工业工人，组织手工业加工厂。第二种，通过“发原料、收成品”的方式，向手工业委托加工、订货。通过委托加工、订货组织起来的手工业生产小组共有二十二个，包括磨粉、染布、竹器、铁器、细木等八个行业。第三种，根据当地手工业的产销情况和农民对手工业产品的数量、规格和品质的要求，有计划地向手工业者收购产品。
    为了使手工业者的产品合乎农民的要求，连江县供销合作社派人深入农村，调查了农民对各种农具的规格、质量的要求及需要的时间和数量，并有重点地和一部分农业生产合作社、互助组订立供销结合合同，具体规定需要手工业品的规格和时间等，然后供销合作社就根据农民的需要，和手工业者订立合同，有计划地组织手工业者生产。这样把农民的需要和手工业者的生产密切结合起来以后，就从根本上改变了产销上的盲目现象。
    组织手工业生产还有一个十分重要的问题，就是如何保证产品的质量。去年春耕时，连江县供销合作社组织当地手工业者加工了一批锄头。这批锄头由于粗制滥造，质量很差，农民说：“锄头洋铁造，没用先弯腰。”因而积压了三百多把。他们接受了这次教训，采取下面四种方式来保证产品质量：一、加强对手工业者的思想教育，教育他们努力提高质量，降低成本；二、提早向手工业者委托加工、订货，防止手工业者因旺季赶工而粗制滥造；三、召开座谈会，组织消费者直接向生产者提出改进产品质量的意见；四、发动手工业者相互交流经验，学习生产技术。这几种办法推行以后，产品质量就逐步改进了。
    受到了农民的欢迎
    连江县供销合作社组织当地手工业生产以后，供应工作出现了新的面貌。供销合作社的商品供应量大大增加，去年零售总额达四百四十八亿九千多万元，超过原计划百分之一百零一，其中十二月份零售额比一月份增加了三十四亿元；今年零售计划又比去年扩大了，其中春耕农具供应计划比去年扩大两倍多。另外，也帮助手工业者解决了原料采购、成品推销中的困难，逐步改变了忙闲季生产不均的现象，并推动手工业者组织起来，逐步实现手工业的社会主义改造。目前，连江县广大农民对供销合作社的评语是：合作社真正是我们自己的，了解我们要什么，就供给我们什么！
