One of the important projects of Chongqing 507 Power Plant, the water pumping station, has been completed and successfully test-run on February 27th. The pumping station is built on the banks of the Yangtze River. It required digging a large dry well, 40 meters deep and 66 meters in circumference, vertically into the hard sand and stone. Then, a tunnel was dug from the bottom of the dry well to connect to the Yangtze River, and the machinery was installed underground at a level lower than the low water level. Some of the water pumped from the pumping station is sent to the boiler to burn steam; most of it is sent to the condenser to cool the steam. After this water is used, a portion of it flows through another water pipe, passing through the pumping station, and into the Yangtze River to increase the cooling effect of the machinery; another portion is discharged from above the pumping station, impacting a water turbine, causing the water turbine to operate automatically, driving the water pump to draw fresh water from the Yangtze River again, and sending it to the boiler and condenser. This cyclical operation can save electricity. In this arduous project, the guidance of Soviet experts was obtained, and the broad masses of workers displayed their initiative and creativity. For example, technician Yang Baohe designed a movable wooden mold, which completed the inner shell concrete project ahead of schedule. During the installation of the free-flowing water pipe, crane operator Liu Shuliang disregarded the severe winter cold and jumped into the river to work. Although his whole body was frozen and turned color, he refused to rest, ensuring the successful installation of the free-flowing water pipe.

On the morning of February 27th, the workers carried out various preparatory tasks. Soviet experts personally inspected the machines, water pipes, and sedimentation tanks. With all preparations complete, the command issued the trial operation order at 12:45 pm. The electrical site engineer excitedly turned the button on the water pump control panel. The water drawn from the Yangtze River into the wet chamber surged upwards along the free-flowing water pipe, coming to the sedimentation tank, and then being released from the sedimentation tank, flowing along the drain pipe into the Yangtze River. The trial operation was successful. The successful completion of this project provides favorable conditions for the early power generation of the 507 Power Plant.

    重庆五零七电厂水泵房送水试运转成功
    重庆五零七电厂重要工程之一——水泵房已经建成，并在二月二十七日试运转成功。水泵房建筑在长江岸边，要在坚硬的沙石上向下竖掘一个四十公尺深、圆周六十六公尺的干筒大井。然后从干筒底下打一个隧道通到长江里面，在比枯水位还要低的地层底下安装上机器。从水泵房里吸上来的水一部分送到锅炉里燃烧蒸汽；大部分送到凝结器里冷却蒸汽。这种水用完后有一部分就顺着另一股水管经过水泵房，流到长江里去，增加机器冷却效果；有一部分从水泵房上面倾泻下来，冲动水轮机，使水轮机自动运转，带动水泵从长江里再吸上新鲜的水，送到锅炉和凝结器去，这样巡回运转，能节约用电。在这个艰巨的工程中，得到苏联专家的指导，广大职工发挥了积极性和创造性。如技术员杨宝和设计了活动木模，提前完成了内壳混凝土工程。在安装自流水管时，起重工人刘树良不顾严冬寒冷，跳到河里去工作，虽然全身被冻得变了色，也不肯休息，使自流水管顺利安装成功。
    二月二十七日清晨，工人们进行了各项准备工作，苏联专家亲自检查了机器、水管和沉淀池，各种工作都准备妥当了，指挥部在十二点四十五分发出了试运转命令。电气工地专责工程师兴奋地把水泵控制盘的电钮一扭，从长江抽进到湿室里的水，就顺着自流水管上冲，汹涌地来到沉淀池里，然后又从沉淀池里放出来，顺着排水管流到长江。试运转情况良好。该项工程的胜利完成，为五零七电厂早日发电提供了有利条件。
