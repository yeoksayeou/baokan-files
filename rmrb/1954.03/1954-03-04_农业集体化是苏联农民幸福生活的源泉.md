Agricultural Collectivization is the Source of the Soviet Peasants' Happy Life
Huang Laiyu

I. Collectivization Opens Up Broad Roads for Agricultural Development

	Before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia was a backward agricultural country, with a scattered, individual small-peasant economy dominating the national economy. Most of the fertile land in the countryside was in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. The broad masses of laboring peasants were bound to small plots of land, subjected to the brutal exploitation and oppression of the Tsarist government, landlords, rich peasants, and usurers, and plunged into poverty and bankruptcy. They were unable to improve their economic conditions, so agricultural technology was very backward and yields were low. From 1910 to 1914, the highest grain harvest averaged only 730 kilograms per hectare (15 mu) per year. Most peasants did not have enough grain to eat, and there were frequent famines. In years of poor harvests, tens of thousands of peasants struggled on the brink of starvation.

	The victory of the October Revolution brought liberation to the peasants. The peasants received from the state more than 150 million Russian acres of land that previously belonged to landlords and churches, and were exempted from paying them about 500 million rubles in rent each year. They began to happily cultivate their own land. However, they still used clumsy plows, hoes, and animal power, and the ancient farming methods had not changed. On the eve of the First Five-Year Plan, this situation had not changed much, and agricultural production had not increased significantly compared to before the revolution. At the same time, due to changes in the rural economic structure after the October Revolution, agricultural production became more fragmented, and the output of commercial grain increased very slowly (the amount of commercial grain was only slightly more than 37 percent of the pre-war level), far from meeting the needs of national industrial development, and the lives of peasants could not be significantly improved. Thus, the backward management methods of small farmers became an obstacle to the development of the entire national economy.

	Based on Lenin's cooperative plan, Stalin, in his report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), specifically pointed out the way to overcome this obstacle, that is, to actively and gradually unite the scattered individual small-peasant economy into socialist collective farms that could use tractors, agricultural machinery, and new farming methods to operate, using typical demonstrations and persuasion methods. From the end of 1929, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and Stalin, Soviet peasants launched a vigorous collectivization movement. After eight to ten years, they victoriously completed the cause of overall agricultural collectivization, eliminated the rich peasant class, united individual farmers into huge collective farms, completely eradicated the roots of capitalism in the countryside, and created favorable conditions for the use of new technologies and agricultural science in agriculture. With the development of socialist industry, the state supplied collective farms with large numbers of tractors and other agricultural machinery. On the eve of the Patriotic War, the country's agriculture already had 523,000 tractors, 182,000 combine harvesters, 228,000 trucks, and many power stations. Soviet agriculture had become the largest and most mechanized agriculture in the world. During the Second World War, Soviet collective farms suffered serious damage and destruction by the German invaders. However, after the efforts to restore them during the post-war Five-Year Plan and the merger movement of collective farms, with the help of a strong socialist industry, the mechanization and electrification of collective farms have undergone new and greater development. Now, the work of cultivating, sowing, irrigating, milling, milking, and shearing sheep in collective farms has been widely carried out using machines and electricity.

	The collectivization and mechanization of agriculture have greatly improved agricultural productivity. In 1950, more than 750 regions across the country averaged more than 1,600 kilograms of wheat harvested per hectare, and another 70 regions averaged more than 2,400 kilograms of wheat harvested per hectare. In the best years of the Tsarist era, the annual production of grain never exceeded 5 billion poods, but in 1952, the total grain output of the Soviet Union reached 8 billion poods. The grain problem, which was considered the most acute and serious during the early stages of Soviet industrialization, has now been completely and permanently resolved. Other technical crops and animal husbandry have also undergone great development. Due to the unprecedented surge in Soviet agriculture, the income of collective farms has greatly increased.

II. A Material Life of Common Prosperity

	The victory of the collective farm system not only guaranteed the full supply of grain and raw materials for the country, but also fundamentally changed the lives of the peasants.

	Collective farms are based on the public ownership of the means of production (land, large farm tools, large livestock, etc.), and there is no phenomenon of exploitation of man by man. The fruits of the collective labor of collective farmers, after paying state taxes, paying for the work of agricultural machinery stations, and leaving funds and public welfare expenses for the farm, the remaining large portion of income is distributed according to the principle of "to each according to his work," that is, according to the amount and quality of each person's labor, the "labor days" (unit of work) are calculated and remuneration is paid. In addition, if the output produced by the work team or individual exceeds the standards stipulated by the state and the farm, they can also receive honorary and material rewards. This distribution method closely combines the personal interests of each member with the collective interests. Whoever works more and better will receive a higher income, and at the same time, he will bring more benefits to the collective farm. Therefore, the members are very concerned about the development of the farm's public economy.

	The income of Soviet collective farmers is very high. Ordinary farmers can work 250 to 500 "labor days" per year, and many can work 800 or 900 or even more than 1,000 "labor days." The remuneration for each "labor day" is generally 3-5 kilograms of grain and 4-6 rubles in cash. In collective farms in areas that mainly operate economic crops, the remuneration for "labor days" is even higher. In addition, each household can also use about one-quarter to one-half hectare of land near their houses to grow vegetables and fruit trees, raise a certain number of livestock, and as many poultry as they like, as their sideline income. For example, the members of the "Michurin Collective Farm" worked a total of 839,121 "labor days" in 1951. The remuneration for each "labor day" was four kilograms of grain and nine rubles and thirteen kopecks in cash. Each household received an average of 2,028 kilograms of grain and 4,545 rubles in cash according to the "labor days." At the same time, each household also had 0.49 hectares of personal garden plots, growing vegetables and fruit trees, and raising dairy cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry, with an average income of 5,500 rubles. Adding the two together, the average income of each household in 1951 was 10,045 rubles and 2,028 kilograms of grain. This much income is very common in various farms.

	The straight-line decline in Soviet prices has made the income of peasants even more abundant. Based on the soaring of industrial and agricultural production and the continuous reduction of product costs, the Soviet Communist Party and the government have taken measures to lower prices to improve the material welfare of the people. Since the war, the Soviet Union has lowered prices six times from 1947 to last April, with an average price reduction of more than half. The benefits that the Soviet people have received after the six price reductions are very large. For example, in terms of food, the money that could buy one kilogram of bread in 1947 can now buy 2.85 kilograms of bread; the money that could only buy one kilogram of butter at that time can now buy three kilograms. In terms of industrial products, the money spent in 1947 to buy a wardrobe with a mirror and a blanket can now be used to buy the same items, plus a sofa, a shiny wooden wire bed and mattress, a small cabinet, and a table lamp. Due to the increase in income and the decrease in prices, collective farmers live a very comfortable material life. They not only have good meals, but also have a lot of money left over to buy good clothes, good furniture, cultural supplies, and publications. In many households, the cost of food for the members is less than one-third of the agricultural products obtained from the whole year's work, and the rest is mostly used to buy industrial products. For example, the family of Mirzoyeva, a female member of the "Red October" Collective Farm, has a total of twelve people. They have three meals a day, all of which are bread, butter, cheese, eggs, sugar tea, and meat. They eat an average of six catties of meat per day. In 1951, her family spent 12,000 rubles to add three houses, and also bought 12,000 rubles of more expensive items, including wardrobes, iron beds, sofas, radios, carpets, clocks, samovars, a set of embroidered tablecloths, bed sheets, chair covers, and her own woolen overcoat. In addition, everyone added some clothes and shoes as needed. She herself now has two winter coats, one autumn coat, eight woolen and silk shirts, seven work clothes, and five pairs of good leather shoes. Although her family lives so well, they still can't spend all their income. Her family's income in 1951 still had a surplus of 3,000 rubles and 3,000 catties of grain by the end of July 1952.

	The houses of Soviet peasants are very comfortable and beautiful. A comrade who visited the Soviet Union once visited the family of a collective farm member, Yolosekov. His family of three lived in a Western-style bungalow with a total of four rooms, including a dining room, a bedroom, and a dance hall. There was a radio, two sofas, a single bed, and a double bed in the room, covered with thick blankets and down mattresses. Many photos were hung on the walls, colorful and very elegant. Behind their house was another orchard, and the lush branches and leaves of the fruit trees set off the residence in a very quiet and elegant way. When the visiting comrade expressed admiration for their beautiful life, the comrade who guided the visit also said: "The German invaders destroyed it too badly. We can only make do now. The main energy must be put on construction. In Georgia, which has not been damaged by the war, the lives of the peasants there are better than ours. They live in two-story buildings, and they all have radios and phonographs, and some even have pianos!"

	The public facilities of collective farms are also very good. There are many farms in the Soviet Union, just like those depicted in the film "A Happy Life," which are almost like cities. There are electric lights, telephones, running water, schools, clubs, clinics, nurseries, cinemas, radio stations, state-owned shops, etc. The streets of the farm are flat and wide boulevards, and the transportation is very convenient. Each farm has many cars, and some members even have their own cars, and there are too many who have their own bicycles. More than 600 of the 730 households in the "Dawn" Collective Farm have bicycles.

III. A High Degree of Cultural Life and Good Welfare Benefits

	Before the October Revolution, the Soviet people, like our Chinese people, had many illiterate people, and three-quarters of the country's population was illiterate. The victory of the October Revolution and the completion of agricultural collectivization enabled the Soviet people to get rid of ignorance and ignorance. As early as 1940, the Soviet Union had basically eliminated illiteracy. Now, Soviet collective farmers not only have a wealthy material life, but also enjoy a high degree of cultural and educational life. The Soviet Communist Party and the government are very concerned about the improvement of people's culture, and have widely established an education network throughout the country. Now, primary schools, middle schools, and agricultural and animal husbandry technical training classes that do not separate from production have been generally established in rural areas. Every young and middle-aged peasant has received at least seven years of education. After graduating from local ordinary schools, many children of collective farmers also enter specialized technical schools and universities to study. In collective farms, everyone has a high desire for knowledge, and even farmers who do not separate from production often attend classes at the farm's agricultural and animal husbandry training classes. In addition to schools, collective farms also have libraries and reading rooms. Each member also subscribes to newspapers and magazines at home. For example, the members of the "Michurin" Collective Farm spent 95,000 rubles on buying books and subscribing to newspapers and magazines in 1952. The members have good study habits and often read books and newspapers. A female member of the "October Victory" Collective Farm read forty-eight books in one winter. In addition to reading books and newspapers, they also often hold report meetings and forums.

	The cultural and recreational life of collective farms is very active. In each farm, there are beautiful clubs where members have organized various amateur song and dance troupes, orchestras, chess groups, and various sports teams according to their hobbies. In addition, touring song and dance troupes from the city often come to collective farms to perform for the members. Watching movies has become one of the Soviet peasants' favorite pastimes. Collective farm clubs often show movies, and during the busy farming season, mobile screening teams go to the field production teams to show them. Members can watch at least once a week. The "Khrushchev" Collective Farm screened ninety movies in four and a half months in 1952. Many households also have radios installed. After a hard day's work, they can sit down and listen to news broadcasts and beautiful music from Moscow and major cities. The members work seven or eight hours a day, rest on Sundays, and on Sundays or during the slack farming season, men and women often put on beautiful clothes and take the farm's car or their own car to visit nearby scenic spots or parks. Collective farms that are closer to the city also often organize their members to go to the theater in the city to watch plays.

	Collective farms are also very concerned about the welfare of their members. For example, some farms in the Soviet Union are very large, and the arable land is far away from the members' homes. The farm has built comfortable field dormitories for the members and tractor drivers of the agricultural machinery station, which are equipped with bedrooms, dining rooms, bathrooms, and cultural rooms, etc., for the members to stay temporarily. Each farm has a clinic, and larger farms also have hospitals. The "Stalin" Collective Farm has a hospital with a capacity of fifty beds, and also has a pharmacy and a maternity hospital, providing free medical treatment for the members. During the treatment period, the farm pays them half of the "labor days" according to the size of the patient's usual labor force. In addition, there are sanatoriums and convalescent homes in some scenic spots and scenic areas. Members who have achieved success in labor have the opportunity to take turns to recuperate. The elderly in collective farms receive special care. Old members can not participate in labor and are paid a pension by the farm. However, everyone in the Soviet Union loves labor very much. Except for the sick, weak, and disabled who are completely unable to work, no elderly person is willing to rest. They are willing to do their best to do more things for the country.

	In collective farms, women are completely equal to men in politics, economics, and culture. They work as hard as men, and many women hold leadership positions in the farms. In some collective farms, female labor heroes often account for more than half. The farm provides meticulous care for women and children. During pregnancy, the farm only allows female members to do some light work. There are maternity hospitals when giving birth, and two months of vacation after childbirth. Female tractor drivers can rest for three months because their work is heavier. During the rest period, the farm pays her half of her usual "labor days" (some also give all of the "labor days"). Mothers who are breastfeeding can go to work later and leave work earlier, and are given time to breastfeed during work, and are assigned to work in a closer place as much as possible. Some farms also have special transportation vehicles for breastfeeding mothers. Mothers can get subsidies from the farm starting from the birth of their third child. Those with many children can also receive national awards and become "Mother Heroes." Every collective farm in the Soviet Union has nurseries and kindergartens. Here, mothers with many children not only do not feel burdened, but are also very glorious.

IV. A Better Life is Beckoning Collective Farmers

	The happy life of Soviet peasants is endless. The Soviet Communist Party not only led the Soviet people to establish today's socialist society, but is also leading the Soviet people to struggle for the construction of a more beautiful and happier communist society. According to the great Stalin's plan to transform nature, the Soviet people are building four huge hydroelectric power stations and three major canals, planting eight shelterbelts across sixteen provinces, adopting a grassland rotation system in the country's farmland, excavating more than 44,000 large-scale ponds and reservoirs, and establishing new irrigation systems throughout the country. After these facilities are completed, all sectors of agriculture will be more widely electrified, Soviet agriculture will be forever free from the harm of climate change, and bumper harvests will be guaranteed every year.

	In 1953, the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party also stipulated important measures for further developing agriculture, decided to greatly reduce the agricultural taxes of collective farmers and the standards for compulsory sales of personal livestock products to the state, canceled all the arrears of compulsory supply of livestock products that they should have paid to the state in the past few years, lowered the standards for collective farms to compulsorily sell potatoes and vegetables to the state, and raised the state's purchase prices. This not only increased the income of collective farms and peasants by more than 13 billion rubles last year, but also encouraged their production enthusiasm, giving them more of the above products. In addition, the conference decided to improve all the work of agricultural machinery stations, provide collective farms with more tractors and agricultural machinery, send a large number of agricultural experts and leading cadres to serve the farms, and strengthen the leadership of the farms. This will make Soviet agriculture more highly mechanized and fully exploit the internal potential of agriculture, so that agricultural production can achieve greater surges. After the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the income of Soviet peasants will increase by more than 40 percent.

	Soviet collective farmers are not satisfied with today's happy life. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, they are building a more wonderful and happier communist society with selfless labor enthusiasm!

	The Soviet experience vividly teaches us that the improvement of life must be based on the development of production. If our peasants want to vigorously develop production and live a good life like Soviet peasants, they can only follow the path of Soviet agricultural collectivization. Today's mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas is to gradually realize the socialist transformation of our agriculture and guide the peasants to socialism. Our peasants, as long as they are closely united around the Communist Party and steadily advance along the road of mutual aid and cooperation, the ideal of agricultural collectivization will surely be realized!

    农业集体化是苏联农民幸福生活的源泉
    黄来于
    一、集体化为农业的发展开辟了广阔的道路
    十月革命前的沙皇俄国，是一个落后的农业国家，分散的个体的小农经济在国民经济中占主要地位。农村大部分的肥沃土地掌握在地主和富农的手里，广大的劳动农民被束缚在小块土地上，受尽了沙皇政府、地主、富农和高利贷商人的残酷剥削和压迫，陷于贫困和破产，无力改善自己的经济状况，因此农业技术十分落后，收成很低。在一九一○年到一九一四年，谷类的最高收获量，每年平均每公顷（十五亩）只有七百三十公斤。大多数农民收成的粮食都不够吃，并且经常闹灾荒，每逢歉收年份，成千成万的农民挣扎在饥饿的死亡线上。
    十月革命的胜利给农民带来了解放。农民从国家手中分得了约一亿五千万俄亩以上过去属于地主、教堂的土地，免除了每年向他们交纳的约五亿卢布的地租。他们开始高兴地在自己的土地上耕作。但是他们使用的仍旧是粗笨的犁仗、锄头和畜力，古老的耕作方法还没有改变。在第一个五年计划前夜，这种情况仍没有什么改变，农业生产比革命前并没有大量的增加。同时由于十月革命后农村经济结构的变化，农业生产更加零散，商品粮食的产量增长得非常缓慢，（商品粮的数量只等于战前的百分之三十七强），远不能满足国家工业发展的需要，农民的生活也不能有显著的改善。这样，小农的落后的经营方式，就变成了整个国民经济发展的障碍。
    斯大林根据列宁的合作社计划，在联共（布）第十五次代表大会的报告中，具体地指出了克服这个障碍的出路，即采用典型示范和说服的方法，积极地逐步地把零散的个体小农经济联合为能够使用拖拉机、农业机器和新的农作法来经营的社会主义集体农庄。从一九二九年底起，苏联农民在苏联共产党和斯大林的领导下，开展了轰轰烈烈的集体化运动。他们经过了八年到十年时间，胜利地完成了全盘农业集体化的事业，消灭了富农阶级，把个体农户联合成巨大的集体农庄，彻底铲除了农村资本主义的根苗，创造了在农业中利用新技术和农业科学的便利条件。随着社会主义工业的发展，国家供给了集体农庄大批的拖拉机和其他农业机器。到卫国战争前夜，全国农业已拥有五十二万三千台拖拉机，十八万二千台联合收割机，二十二万八千辆载重汽车和许多电力站。苏联的农业已成为世界上规模最大和机械化程度最高的农业。在第二次世界大战期中，苏联集体农庄虽遭受了德寇的严重破坏和摧残。但经过战后五年计划的努力恢复和集体农庄的合并运动，在强大的社会主义工业的帮助下，集体农庄的机械化和电气化有了新的更大的发展。现在集体农庄的耕耘、播种、灌溉、磨面、挤牛奶、剪羊毛等工作，都已广泛地使用机器和电力。
    农业的集体化和机械化，大大地提高了农业生产力。一九五○年全国有七百五十个地区以上平均每公顷的小麦收获量达一千六百公斤以上，另有七十个地区每公顷的小麦收获量达二千四百公斤以上。在沙皇时代最好的年份，谷物每年的生产量从来没有超过五十亿普特，但一九五二年苏联的谷物总产量已达八十亿普特。在苏联工业化初期被认为最尖锐、最严重的粮食问题，现在已彻底而永远地解决了。其他技术作物和畜牧业也有了很大的发展。由于苏联农业的空前高涨，集体农庄的收入是大大地增加了。
    二、大家共同富裕的物质生活
    集体农庄制度的胜利，不但保证了充分供应国家的粮食和原料，而且从根本上改变了农民的生活。
    集体农庄是建立在生产资料（土地、大农具、大牲畜等）公有制的基础上的，这里没有人剥削人的现象。集体农民劳动的成果，除缴纳国家税收、付给农业机器站的工作报酬、留给农庄作基金和公共事业费用外，剩下的很大一部分的收入，是根据
  “按劳取酬”的原则来分配，即按每个人劳动的多少和好坏来计算“劳动日”（计工单位）发给报酬。此外，如果工作队或个人生产出来的产量超过了国家和农庄的规定标准，还能得到荣誉和物质奖励。这种分配办法，把每个庄员的个人利益和集体利益密切地结合起来。谁干得更多更好，谁得到的收入也就更高，同时他也就给集体农庄带来更多的利益。因此，庄员们都很关心农庄公共经济的发展。
    苏联集体农民的收入是很高的。一般农民每年能作二百五十到五百个“劳动日”，多的能作到八九百个甚至一千个以上的“劳动日”。每一个“劳动日”的报酬一般是三—五公斤的粮食、四—六卢布的现金。以经营经济作物为主的地区的集体农庄，“劳动日”的报酬还要高。此外，每个农户还可以使用他们房子附近约四分之一公顷到半公顷的土地，来种植蔬菜、果树，养一定数量的牲畜和随便多少的家禽，作为自己的副业收入。如“米丘林集体农庄”庄员们在一九五一年共作了八十三万九千一百二十一个“劳动日”。每个“劳动日”的报酬为四公斤粮食和九卢布十三戈比现金。每户按照“劳动日”平均分得了二千零二十八公斤粮食和四千五百四十五个卢布的现金。同时，每户还有零点四九公顷的个人宅旁园圃，栽种蔬菜、果树，喂养奶牛、猪、羊、家禽，平均又可收入五千五百卢布。两项相加，平均每户在一九五一年收入一万零四十五卢布和二千零二十八公斤粮食。这个农庄平均每户只有三口人，每个人平均可以得到三千三
  百四十八卢布和六百七十六公斤粮食的收入。这样
  多的收入，在各个农庄里却是很普遍的。
    苏联物价的直线下降，使农民的收入更加丰裕。苏联共产党和政府，在工农业生产一往直前地高涨和产品成本不断降低的基础上，采取降低物价的措施，来提高人民的物质福利。苏联自战后一九四七年到去年四月一连降低了六次物价，物品价格平均降低了一半以上。苏联人民在六次减价后得到的利益是很大的。举例来说：在食品方面，一九四七年可以买一公斤面包的钱，现在可以买到二点八五公斤面包；那时只能买一公斤黄油的钱，现在能买三公斤了。在工业品方面，一九四七年买一个带镜子的衣橱和一幅毛毯所花的钱，现在除买同样的东西以外，还可以再买沙发、发亮的木制钢丝床和床垫、小柜子及台灯各一个。由于收入的增多和物价的降低，集体农民过着很优裕的物质生活，他们不但有很好的膳食，而且还能剩下很多的钱来购买好衣服、好家具、文化用品和出版物。在许多农户中，庄员的膳食费用不到全年工作日所得农产品的三分之一，其余多拿来购买工业品。例如“红十月”集体农庄女庄员米尔左耶娃的家，共有十二口人，一天三餐，都是面包、奶油、奶酪、鸡蛋、糖茶和肉等，他们平均每天要吃六斤肉。一九五一年，她家花了一万二千卢布添盖了三间房子，还购买了一万二千卢布较贵重的物品，包括衣柜、铁床、沙发、收音机、地毯、钟和自暖壶、一套绣花的桌布、床单、椅罩和她自己的呢子大衣。此外，每人按需要都添了一些衣服和鞋子。她自己现在有两件冬大衣、一件秋大衣、八件呢子和绸子的衣衫、七件工作服和五双好皮鞋。她家虽然生活这样好，但收入还是用不完。她家一九五一年的收入直到一九五二年七月底还余存三千卢布和三千斤粮食。
    苏联农民的住宅都很舒适漂亮。有一个到苏联参观的同志曾访问过一个集体农庄庄员约洛瑟可夫的家庭，他家有三口人，住着一幢西式小平房，一共四间，有餐厅、卧室，还有跳舞厅。室内摆着一架收音机，两张沙发，一张单人床，一张双人床，床上铺着厚厚的毛毯和鸭绒褥子。墙壁上挂着许多照片，花花绿绿，十分讲究。他们屋子的后面又有一片果木园，园里果木的茂盛枝叶，把住宅衬托得十分清幽雅致。当参观的同志表示羡慕他们这种美好的生活时，引导参观的同志还说：德寇破坏得太惨重，我们现在只能将就过日子，主要的精力要放在建设上面。在没有经过战争破坏的乔治亚，那里农民的生活就比我们过得好些，他们住的是两层楼房，都有收音机和留声机，有的还有钢琴呢！
    集体农庄的公共设备也很好。苏联有很多农庄，正像影片“幸福的生活”里所描写的那样，和城市差不多，这里有电灯、电话、自来水，有学校、俱乐部、诊疗所、托儿所、电影院、无线电台、图书馆和国营商店等等，农庄的街道是平坦宽广的大马路，交通很方便，每个农庄都有很多的汽车，有些庄员自己还有小汽车，自己有脚踏车的那就太多了。“黎明”集体农庄七百三十几户中就有六百多户有脚踏车。
    三、高度的文化生活和良好的福利待遇
    苏联人民在十月革命以前，也和我们中国一样，不识字的很多，全国人口有四分之三是文盲。十月革命胜利和农业集体化的完成，使苏联人民摆脱了无知和愚昧。远在一九四○年，苏联已基本上消灭了文盲。现在苏联集体农民不但有富裕的物质生活，同时还享受着高度的文化教育生活。苏联共产党和政府对人民文化的提高十分关切，在全国广泛建立起教育网。现在农村都已普遍设立了小学、中学和不脱离生产的农业畜牧技术训练班。每个青壮年的农民至少受过七年以上的教育。许多集体农民的子弟在当地普通学校毕业后，还进入专门的技术学校和高等学校学习。在集体农庄里，每个人的求知欲望都是很高的，就是不脱离生产的农民也经常到农庄的农业畜牧训练班听课。除学校外，集体农庄并设立有图书馆和阅览室。每个庄员自己家里也订有报纸和杂志，如“米丘林”集体农庄庄员，一九五二年买书、订报、订杂志，就花了九万五千卢布。庄员们都有良好的学习习惯，经常阅读书报。“十月胜利”集体农庄有一个女庄员，一冬季就读了四十八本书。他们除看书报外，还经常举办报告会和座谈会。
    集体农庄的文化娱乐生活是很活跃的。在每个农庄里，都设有漂亮的俱乐部，庄员们根据自己的爱好组织了各种业余歌舞团、管弦乐队、奕棋小组和各种球队。此外，城里的巡回歌舞团，也经常到集体农庄给庄员演出。看电影已成为苏联农民最喜爱的娱乐之一。集体农庄俱乐部经常放映电影，在农忙季节，有流动的放映队到田野生产队去放映，庄员们每星期至少可以看一次。“赫鲁晓夫”集体农庄在一九五二年的四个半月中，就放映了九十次电影。许多农户还装有收音机。他们在一天辛勤的劳动之后，可以坐下来听一听从莫斯科和各大城市传来的新闻广播和优美的音乐。庄员们每天工作七八小时，星期日休息，每逢星期日或农闲季节，男男女女常穿上漂亮的衣服，坐着农庄的汽车或自己的小汽车到附近的名胜地方或公园去游览。离城市较近的农庄，还经常组织庄员们到城里的剧院去看戏。
    集体农庄对庄员的福利也是很关心的。例如苏联有的农庄因为范围很大，耕地离开庄员的家庭较远，农庄便为庄员和农业机器站的拖拉机手建筑了舒适的田场宿舍，里面设有寝室、食堂、浴室和文化室等等，供庄员暂时住宿。在每个农庄里都设有医务所，较大的农庄还有医院。“斯大林”集体农庄有容纳五十个床位的一所医院，另外还设有一个药房、一个产科医院，为庄员免费治病；在治病期间，农庄按着病人平常劳动力的大小，发给他一半“劳动日”。此外，在一些名胜风景地区还设有休养所和疗养院，凡劳动有成就的庄员，都有机会轮流去休养。集体农庄的老年人受到特别的关怀。老庄员可以不参加劳动，由农庄发给养老金。不过，苏联人人都很爱好劳动，除了病弱残废根本不能劳动以外，没有一个老年人愿意休息。他们都愿尽自己的力气，替国家多做些事情。
    在集体农庄里，妇女在政治上、经济上、文化上和男子完全平等；她们干活和男人一样强，许多妇女在农庄中担任领导工作。在一些集体农庄中，女劳动英雄往往占一半以上。农庄对妇女和儿童的照顾是无微不至的。每个女庄员在怀孕期间，农庄就只让她做一些轻巧的工作；生小孩时有接生医院，产后有两个月的假期，女拖拉机手因为工作较重，可以休息三个月。在休息期间，农庄按她平时的劳动力，发给她一半的“劳动日”（也有给全部
  “劳动日”的）。有小孩吃奶的母亲，可以迟上班、早下班，工作当中又给予喂奶时间，并尽量分配她们在较近的地方工作，也有的农庄为喂奶的母亲备有专门的交通车。母亲们从生第三个孩子开始，就能得到农庄发给的补助费，孩子众多的还可以受国家的奖励，当上“母亲英雄”。苏联每个集体农庄都有托儿所和幼儿园。在这里，多孩子的母亲不但不感到拖累，而且是很光荣的。
      四、更美好的生活在向着 集体农民们招手
    苏联农民的幸福生活是无止境的。苏联共产党不但领导苏联人民建立了今天的社会主义社会，并且正在领导苏联人民为建设更美好更幸福的共产主义社会而斗争。按照伟大的斯大林改造大自然计划，苏联人民正在建筑四个巨大的水力发电站和三条大运河，植造八条跨过十六省的防护林带，在全国农田中采用牧草轮种制，开凿四万四千多个规模巨大的池塘和蓄水池，在全国范围内建立起新的灌溉系统。这些设施完成后，农业各个部门将更广泛地实现电气化，苏联农业将永远免受气候变化的危害，保证年年丰收。
    一九五三年苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会又规定了进一步发展农业的重要措施，决定大大减低集体农民的农业税收和个人畜产品对国家的义务交售标准，取消他们在过去几年中应交给国家的畜产品的义务供售额的全部欠款，降低各集体农庄向国家义务交售马铃薯、蔬菜这些作物的标准，并提高国家的购买价格。这不仅使集体农庄和农民在去年的收入增加了一百三十多亿卢布，同时更鼓舞了他们的生产积极性，使他们拥有更多的上述产品。此外，会议并决定改进农业机器站的全部工作，供给集体农庄更多的拖拉机和农业机器，派了大批的农业专家和领导干部为农庄服务，加强农庄的领导工作。这将使苏联的农业更高度地机械化，并充分发挥农业内部的潜力，使农业生产得到更大的高涨。在第五个五年计划完成后，苏联农民的收入将增加百分之四十以上。
    苏联集体农民并没有满足于今天的幸福生活，他们在苏联共产党的领导下，正在以忘我的劳动热情，建设着更美妙更幸福的共产主义社会！
    苏联的经验活生生地教育着我们，生活的提高必须建立在生产发展的基础之上。我国农民要大力发展生产，过着像苏联农民那样美好的生活，只有走苏联农业集体化的道路。今天农村的互助合作运动，就是逐步实现对我国农业的社会主义改造，引导农民走向社会主义。我国的农民们，只要紧紧地团结在共产党的周围，循着互助合作的道路稳步前进，农业集体化的理想一定能够实现！
