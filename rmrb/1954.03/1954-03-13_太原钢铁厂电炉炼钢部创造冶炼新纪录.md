The entire workforce of the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, after studying the general line, actively participated in the Taiyuan city-wide inter-factory red flag competition and the plant-organized "Four Guarantees" (guarantee output, guarantee quality, guarantee cost, guarantee safety) competition. Production enthusiasm soared. The Cai Xingxian group of a certain furnace set new smelting time records of 4 minutes and 3 seconds and 3 minutes and 57 seconds on February 15th and 18th respectively, reducing smelting time by three-tenths compared to the past. Inspired by the Cai Xingxian group, the Guo Yong group of a certain furnace also set a new record of 3 minutes and 58 seconds for the furnace's smelting time since its construction on the 18th.

In shortening smelting time, the plant has adopted various effective measures. First, they conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, first laying lime in the furnace in easy-to-melt areas before charging, and kept abreast of the situation of materials sticking to the furnace wall, avoiding sticking materials by applying lime in a timely manner. Second, they actively promoted advanced experiences and improved operating methods. For example, in order to extend the life of the furnace wall and improve quality, they changed the melting volume and power consumption method; they improved the furnace arch water tank to a furnace arch water pipe, solving the water leakage problem and improving output and quality; they improved the charging method and continued to promote the comprehensive operation method of the "eight major tricks" for melting, which greatly accelerated the melting speed and shortened the smelting time. In the course of the competition, attention was also paid to helping the less successful groups and individuals to improve their skills and catch up with the advanced level, which greatly encouraged everyone's enthusiasm for production.

    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部创造冶炼新纪录
    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部全体工人学习总路线后，积极参加了太原市厂际流动红旗竞赛和该厂组织的四保（保产量、保质量、保成本、保安全）竞赛，生产情绪异常高涨。某号炉蔡兴先小组于二月十五、十八两日连创冶炼时间四点零三分和三点五十七分的新纪录，冶炼时间较过去缩短十分之三。某号炉郭勇小组在蔡兴先小组的鼓舞下，也于十八日以三点五十八分的冶炼时间创该炉建炉以来的最高新纪录。
    在缩短冶炼时间中，该厂曾采取了各种有效措施。首先认真贯彻了苏联专家的建议，装料前先把石灰铺在炉内易熔化的地方，随时掌握炉墙四周的粘料情况，及时铺石灰避免了粘料。其次，积极推广先进经验，改进操作方法。如为了延长炉墙寿命，提高质量，改变了熔量和用电方法；将炉拱水箱改进为炉拱水管，解决了漏水现象，提高了产量和质量；改进了装料方法，并继续推广了熔化上八大窍门的综合操作法，大大加快了熔化速度，缩短了冶炼时间。在竞赛过程中同时注意帮助成绩较差的小组和个人，提高技术，赶上先进的水平，大家的生产积极性因而得到了很大的鼓舞。
