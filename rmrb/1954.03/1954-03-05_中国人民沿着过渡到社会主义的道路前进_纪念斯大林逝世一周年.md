    The Chinese People Are Advancing Along the Road to the Transition to Socialism
    -- Commemorating the First Anniversary of Stalin's Death
    Wu Yuzhang
    The great Stalin has been dead for a year. The Chinese people, together with all progressive people, mourn this great leader of the working people of the world, the beloved friend and teacher of the Chinese people - Comrade Stalin.
    The immortal doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the great victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party they cultivated, inspire the working class and oppressed people of the world to fight for their own liberation, for national independence, peace, democracy, and socialism.
    The Chinese people achieved the victory of the democratic revolution under the illumination of the doctrines of Lenin and Stalin, and with the help of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people. Stalin's brilliant instructions on the Chinese revolution armed the Chinese Communist Party ideologically and strategically.
    As early as 1918, Stalin published the famous essay "Do Not Forget the East," which gave the Communist parties of the East, including the Chinese Communist Party, tremendous help in leading the revolutionary movements in their countries.
    Thanks to the help of Lenin and Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921, and immediately formulated a correct program for the democratic revolution, stipulating that its basic task was the struggle against imperialism and feudalism. Following the advice of Lenin and Stalin, the Chinese Communist Party implemented a policy of cooperation with the Kuomintang in order to establish a revolutionary united front of the entire nation. In 1924, it helped Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganize the Kuomintang into a party of revolutionary alliance of workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie. In this way, the Chinese Communist Party laid the foundation for the smooth progress of the First Revolutionary Civil War (1924-1927).
    By November 1926, when the National Revolutionary Army, established in the south of our country, was victoriously carrying out the Northern Expedition and had advanced to the Yangtze River basin, the worker-peasant revolutionary movement organized and encouraged by the Communist Party reached an unprecedented scale. During this period of vigorous development of the domestic revolution, many fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution were sharply raised and urgently needed to be resolved. These issues were: which class should be the leader in the revolution? In which direction will the Chinese revolution develop, towards socialism, or will it end with the victory of capitalism? How to consolidate and expand the victory of the revolution? In the process of the development and deepening of the Chinese revolution, a series of other important issues that urgently needed to be resolved also arose.
    In his speech "On the Future of the Chinese Revolution" and other works, Stalin made a brilliant Marxist-Leninist analysis of the fundamental issues of the Chinese revolution. He clearly determined that the nature of the Chinese revolution in its first stage was a bourgeois democratic revolution against imperialism and against the remnants of medieval China. He emphatically pointed out the weakness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, that the Chinese working class and its party must be the leader of the Chinese revolution, and that realizing leadership over the peasants was its extremely important task. At the same time, in view of the serious danger of imperialism interfering in the Chinese revolution through the hands of Chinese counter-revolutionary forces, Stalin noted the need to raise revolutionary vigilance. Stalin pointed out: Armed revolution against armed counter-revolution in China is one of the characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, the Chinese Communists must pay special attention to studying military affairs in order to master the leadership of the revolutionary army. He pointed out that in the struggle against imperialism and warlords, it is necessary to carry out land revolution in the countryside, meet the demands of the peasants, and even confiscate the land of the landlords and give it to the peasants. As for the future development of the Chinese revolution, Stalin pointed out: The future revolutionary regime in China, by its nature, will be a transitional regime moving towards non-capitalist development, or more precisely, towards socialist development; the basic task of the Chinese Communists is to fight for this path of development for the Chinese revolution.
    These instructions of Stalin correctly and timely answered the questions raised by the historical process of the development of the Chinese revolution at that time, and played a particularly important role in the Chinese Communist Party's formulation of the program and policy of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical work on the Chinese revolution is a continuation and creative development of Stalin's classic instructions.
    In line with Stalin's views, Mao Zedong pointed out in "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," published in March 1926, and in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," published in March 1927: The Chinese industrial proletariat is the leading force of the Chinese revolution, and the most reliable and broadest ally of the proletariat is the peasantry. Based on this, Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically pointed out that the Communist Party must organize the peasants to rise up and fight, rely on the peasants, especially the poor peasants, to overthrow the rule of the landlord class in the countryside, and establish peasant power and peasant armed forces, because only in this way can the foundation of the rule of imperialism and feudal warlords in China be completely destroyed. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the national bourgeoisie is a vacillating class, whose right wing may be our enemy and whose left wing may be our friends. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: We must be vigilant against this class. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in the world situation after the October Revolution, the world has been divided into two major camps, revolution and counter-revolution, and the Chinese revolution is already a part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. The Chinese revolution must take the road of socialist development under the leadership of the proletariat, rather than the road of capitalist development under the rule of the bourgeoisie.
    However, Chen Duxiu's opportunists in the leading organs of the Chinese Communist Party at that time rejected the correct opinions of Stalin and Mao Zedong and implemented an erroneous line of surrendering to the bourgeoisie. This created the possibility for the big bourgeoisie to attack the revolution. In April 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, launched a counter-revolutionary coup, which caused a serious setback to the Chinese revolution.
   During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War periods, Comrade Mao Zedong continued to creatively develop Comrade Stalin's doctrine on the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works and instructions helped the Party overcome the "Left" and Right opportunist tendencies within the Party, correctly lead the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and win the historic great victory against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the beginning of the second stage of the Chinese revolution. Since then, our country has entered a new period of development - a period of gradual transition to socialism. In this period, it is necessary to carry out the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of the national economy. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, our country basically completed the restoration of the national economy in the first three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and began planned economic construction in 1953. In the first year of implementing the Five-Year Plan, we have achieved great achievements in all aspects of the national economy. These achievements vividly demonstrate the victory of the theory of the transition period first established by Marx and Engels, and later developed by Lenin and Stalin. Based on Marxist-Leninist theory on the transition period and the experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, combined with the specific historical conditions of China, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have stipulated the Party's general line and general task for the transition period. Now the Chinese people are struggling to realize the Party's general line and general task for the transition period and to complete the first Five-Year Plan for socialist construction.
    In order to realize the Party's general line, we must, as Stalin taught, and as the Soviet Communist Party led the Soviet people to take, concentrate our main forces on developing heavy industry. At the same time, we must develop the transportation industry, light industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, and education in a corresponding and planned way. We must combine socialist industry and agriculture and gradually guide agriculture and handicrafts onto the road of collectivization, that is to say, gradually transform the individual economy into a socialist economy. At the same time, we must also carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    Stalin taught us, and the example of the Soviet Union taught us, that in order to victoriously realize the Party's general line, we must strengthen the Party's unity and solidarity, strengthen the Party's leading role, and wage a resolute struggle against all "Left" and Right tendencies and all deviations from the Party's general line. We must unite more closely around the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, strengthen the collective leadership within the Party, purify the Party's ranks, consolidate Party discipline, overcome and eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology within the Party, and fight for the correct realization of the Party's general line.
    The example of the Soviet Union proves that the consolidation of a country led by the working class is of particularly great significance for the victory of socialist construction. We must strengthen the people's democratic power led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the unity of the people and the people's government, and use this power to ensure the victorious realization of socialist construction.
    The example of the Soviet Union proves that the worker-peasant alliance is a decisive condition for building socialism. We must constantly strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, resolutely implement the Party's policy of relying on the poor peasants and firmly uniting with the middle peasants in the countryside, gradually developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting rich peasant exploitation. We must patiently educate the peasants and guide them onto the broad road of socialism.
    Stalin taught us in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R." that: to secure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly rising material and cultural requirements of the whole of society, through the continuous expansion and perfection of socialist production on the basis of higher techniques - such is the essence of the basic economic law of socialism. Following this instruction, we must respond to Comrade Mao Zedong's call, learn from the Soviet Union, and strive to learn the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union, and learn how to better organize production and master production technology.
    The ever-victorious doctrine of Lenin and Stalin points out to us that building socialism is an arduous and profound cause of social transformation. To accomplish this great task, we must resolutely overcome all difficulties and exert our creative talents in labor in order to finally eliminate all forms of private ownership of the means of production and make the public ownership of the means of production the sole economic foundation of Chinese society. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Comrade Mao Zedong, and with the vigorous assistance of the Soviet Union, we will surely be able to victoriously achieve this goal.
    Our people are advancing along the road taken by the Soviet Union, that is, the road to socialism. Our people are clearly aware of the great significance of the close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. For the benefit of the people of the two countries and the progressive humanity of the world, we should continue to consolidate and develop the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a great force for preventing imperialism from launching new wars, defending world peace, and our peaceful construction. Relying on this great friendship, our people will be able to achieve victory step by step and successfully build a socialist society in China.

    中国人民沿着过渡到社会主义的道路前进
    ——纪念斯大林逝世一周年
    吴玉章
    伟大的斯大林逝世已一周年了。中国人民和一切进步人民在一起，悼念这位全世界劳动人民伟大的领袖、中国人民敬爱的朋友和导师——斯大林同志。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的不朽学说，苏联人民在列宁、斯大林及其教养起来的苏联共产党领导下所取得的伟大胜利，鼓舞着全世界工人阶级和被压迫人民为自身的解放，为民族独立、和平、民主和社会主义而斗争。
    中国人民是在列宁、斯大林学说的照耀下、在苏联共产党和苏联人民的帮助下获得民主革命的胜利的。斯大林对中国革命问题的英明指示在思想上、策略上武装了中国共产党。
    斯大林早在一九一八年就发表“不要忘记东方”这篇著名的论文，这一论文给东方的共产党人，其中也包括中国共产党人，在领导他们国家的革命运动方面以巨大的帮助。
    由于列宁、斯大林的帮助，中国共产党在一九二一年成立，随即制定了正确的民主革命纲领，并规定了其基本任务是反帝反封建的斗争。中国共产党遵循着列宁、斯大林的意见，执行了与国民党合作的政策，以便建立全民族的革命统一战线。在一九二四年，帮助孙中山先生将国民党改组成为工人、农民、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级革命联盟的党。这样，中国共产党也就为顺利进行第一次国内革命战争（一九二四—一九二七年）打下了基础。
    至一九二六年十一月，当在我国南方成立的国民革命军胜利地进行北伐，并已进展到了长江流域时，为共产党所组织与鼓舞的工农革命运动达到了空前的规模。在这国内革命蓬勃发展的时期，中国革命的许多根本问题，都尖锐地被提了出来，亟需加以解决。这些问题就是：那个阶级应是革命中的领导者？中国革命将向那个方向发展，是走向社会主义呢，还是以资本主义的胜利而告终？如何巩固和扩大革命胜利？在中国革命发展和深入的过程中，还产生了一系列亟需解决的其它重要的问题。
   斯大林在他的“论中国革命底前途”这一演说及其他著作中，对于中国革命的根本问题作了天才的马克思列宁主义的分析。他明确地确定了中国革命在其第一阶段的性质，乃是反对帝国主义和反对中国中世纪残余的资产阶级民主革命。他强调地指出了中国民族资产阶级的弱点，中国工人阶级及其政党必须是中国革命的领导者，而实现对农民的领导乃是它的极其重要的任务。同时，鉴于帝国主义假手中国反革命力量干涉中国革命的严重危险，斯大林注意到了提高革命警惕性的必要。斯大林指出：在中国武装的革命反对武装的反革命是中国革命底特点之一和优点之一。因此，中国共产党人必须特别注意研究军事，以便掌握革命军队的领导权。他指出在反帝国主义反军阀的斗争中必须在农村开展土地革命，满足农民要求，直到没收地主土地，交给农民。至于中国革命发展的前途，斯大林指出：中国未来的革命政权，按其性质来说，将是走向非资本主义发展的，或者说得更确切些，是走向社会主义发展的过渡政权；为中国革命这条发展道路而斗争，就是中国共产党人底基本任务。
    斯大林的这些指示，正确地及时地答复了中国革命发展的历史进程在当时提出的问题，并在中国共产党制定中国革命问题的纲领方针中起着特别重要的作用。毛泽东同志关于中国革命问题的理论工作，是继续创造性地发展了斯大林这些经典的指示。
    和斯大林的意见相一致，毛泽东同志在一九二六年三月发表的“中国社会各阶级的分析”和在一九二七年三月发表的“湖南农民运动考察报告”中指出：中国工业无产阶级是中国革命的领导力量，无产阶级的最可靠最广大的同盟军是农民。根据这一点，毛泽东同志强调地指出：共产党必须组织农民起来斗争，依靠农民尤其是贫农起来推翻地主阶级在农村中的统治，建立农民政权和农民武装，因为只有这样才能彻底摧毁帝国主义和封建军阀在中国统治的基础。毛泽东同志指出：民族资产阶级是一个动摇的阶级，其右翼可能是我们的敌人，其左翼可能是我们的朋友。毛泽东同志写道：对这个阶级我们必须提高警惕。毛泽东同志指出：在十月革命后的世界局面下，世界已划分为革命和反革命两大阵营，中国革命已是世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分，中国革命必然是在无产阶级领导下走社会主义发展的道路，而不是在资产阶级统治下走资本主义发展的道路。
    但是当时中国共产党领导机关内的陈独秀机会主义者，拒绝斯大林和毛泽东同志的正确意见，而执行了向资产阶级投降的错误路线。这就造成了大资产阶级打击革命的可能。一九二七年四月，国民党反动派蒋介石集团举行了反革命政变，因而使中国革命遭到了严重的挫折。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期和第三次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志继续创造性地发展了斯大林同志关于中国革命问题的学说。毛泽东同志的理论著作与指示帮助党克服了党内“左”倾右倾机会主义的倾向，正确地领导中国人民的革命斗争，赢得了反帝国主义、反封建主义和反官僚资本主义的历史性的伟大胜利。
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着中国革命第二阶段的开始。从此，我国进入了发展的新时期——逐步向社会主义过渡的时期。在这一时期要实行国家的社会主义工业化及国民经济的社会主义改造。我们国家在苏联的无私援助下，在中华人民共和国成立以来头三年的时期中，基本上完成了国民经济的恢复工作，而且从一九五三年起，开始了有计划的经济建设。在执行五年计划的头一年，我们在国民经济的各方面已获得了巨大的成绩。这些成就生动地证明着为马克思和恩格斯所首先建立的，后来并为列宁和斯大林所发展的关于过渡时期理论的胜利。党中央和毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义关于过渡时期的理论和苏联建成社会主义的经验，结合中国的具体历史条件，规定了我们党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。现在中国人民正在为实现党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务、为完成社会主义建设的第一个五年计划而斗争。
    为了实现党的总路线，我们必须像斯大林所教导的那样，像苏联共产党领导苏联人民所走过的道路那样，集中主要力量发展重工业，同时，相应地、有计划地发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业、商业和文化教育事业。我们必须把社会主义工业和农业结合起来逐步地引导农业、手工业走上合作化的道路，也就是说逐步地改造个体经济为社会主义经济。同时，我们还须对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。
    斯大林教导我们，苏联的榜样教导我们，为了胜利实现党的总路线，必须加强党的团结一致，加强党的领导作用，和一切脱离党的总路线的“左”的右的倾向及一切偏向作坚决的斗争。我们必须更紧密地团结在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会周围，加强党内的集体领导，纯洁党的队伍，巩固党的纪律，克服和肃清党内资产阶级思想的影响，为正确实现党的总路线而斗争。
    苏联的榜样证明：工人阶级所领导的国家的巩固对社会主义建设事业的胜利具有特别重大的意义。我们一定要加强工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权，加强人民和人民政府的团结一致，运用这个力量来保证社会主义建设的胜利实现。
    苏联的榜样证明：工农联盟是建成社会主义的决定性的条件。我们要不断地加强工农联盟，在农村中坚决地执行党的依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削——这一系列的政策。必须耐心地教育农民，引导农民走上社会主义的大道。
    斯大林在‘论社会主义经济问题’一书中教导我们说：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要，这乃是社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求。遵循这个指示，我们必须响应毛泽东同志的号召，向苏联学习，努力地学习苏联的先进经验和先进技术，学会更好地组织生产和掌握生产技术的本领。
    百战百胜的列宁斯大林的学说为我们指出：建成社会主义是一个艰巨的深刻的社会改造事业。要完成这一伟大任务，我们必须坚决地克服一切困难，在劳动中竭尽我们创造性的才能，以便最后消灭一切形式的生产资料的私有制度，而使生产资料的公有制度成为中国社会唯一的经济基础。我们相信在党中央、中央人民政府和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在苏联的大力帮助下，我们一定可以胜利地达到这个目的。
    我国人民正沿着苏联所走过的道路，即通向社会主义的道路前进，我国人民都明显地感觉到中苏两国人民之间的亲密友谊的巨大意义。为了两国人民的利益及全世界进步人类的利益，我们应继续巩固和发展中苏两国人民之间的永恒的牢不可破的友谊。中苏两国人民亲密的友谊乃是制止帝国主义发动新的战争，保卫世界和平和我国的和平建设的伟大力量。依靠这个伟大的友谊，我国人民将能一步一步地取得胜利，并在中国胜利地建成社会主义社会。
