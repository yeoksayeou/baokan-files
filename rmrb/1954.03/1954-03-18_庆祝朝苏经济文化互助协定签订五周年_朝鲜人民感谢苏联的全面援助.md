Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 17th: The Korean people grandly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.

    "Labor News" published an article by Jeong Jun-taek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, entitled "The Great Help of the Soviet People to the Korean People." The author pointed out that it was thanks to this assistance that the Korean people were able to rapidly restore and develop the national economy.

    Korean newspapers also published many other materials to illustrate the comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union. According to reports in the newspapers, the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Works, the Heechon Automobile Parts Factory, the Kangson Steel Plant, and other metallurgical enterprises and metal processing plants under restoration have all received Soviet lathes, drilling machines, wires, and building materials. Soviet equipment has greatly accelerated the pace of restoration work. The Soviet people sent Korean miners various technical equipment such as drilling machines, electric motors, and pumps. At the Tieshan mine, the labor productivity of the miners increased by 50 percent due to the use of Soviet drilling machines. Not long ago, more than a dozen Soviet excavators were transported here. Soviet excavators, bulldozers, road rollers, large cranes, and concrete mixers are continuously transported to the restored Korean cities. After the armistice, Korean railway workers received various equipment and materials such as steel rails, compressors, and motors.

    Before the spring sowing, Korean farmers received tens of thousands of tons of mineral fertilizers shipped from the Soviet Union. North Pyongan Province alone received 8,380 tons of chemical fertilizers.

    The Soviet Union has also given great help to the Korean people in cultural fields. Many young Korean men and women are studying at Soviet universities. Some of them, after completing their studies in the Soviet Union, have now returned to their motherland and are actively participating in the restoration work of the motherland. Three hundred and thirteen experts who graduated from Soviet universities are now working in various sectors of the national economy, as well as in science and culture. The Soviet Union regularly sends large quantities of literary, political, and technical books, as well as films, which are screened all over the country.

    When celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Korean-Soviet Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the working people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expressed their gratitude to the Soviet people for their selfless assistance and expressed their determination to further consolidate the friendship between the Korean and Soviet peoples.

    庆祝朝苏经济文化互助协定签订五周年
    朝鲜人民感谢苏联的全面援助
   【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社平壤十六日讯：朝鲜人民隆重庆祝朝苏经济文化互助协定签订五周年。
    “劳动新闻”刊载了国家计划委员会委员长郑准泽的一篇文章，题目是“苏联人民给朝鲜人民的巨大帮助”。作者指出，由于朝鲜人民得到了这种帮助，才有可能迅速恢复和发展国民经济。
    朝鲜报纸还刊载了许多其他材料来说明苏联的全面援助。据各报报道，金策制铁所、熙川汽车部件制造厂、降仙炼钢厂和其他一些恢复中的冶金企业和金属加工企业都获得了苏联的车床、钻床、电线和建筑材料。苏联的设备使恢复工作的速度大大加快。苏联人民给朝鲜矿工们送来了各种技术设备，如钻孔机、电动机和唧筒。在铁山矿山，由于采用了苏联的钻孔机，矿工们的劳动生产率提高了百分之五十。不久以前这里运来了十几台苏联的挖掘机。苏联的挖掘机、推土机、碾压机、大型起重机、混凝土搅拌机源源运到恢复中的朝鲜城市。停战之后，朝鲜的铁路工作人员获得了各种器材和设备，如钢轨、压缩机和电机。
    在春季播种以前，朝鲜的农民就获得了苏联运来的成千成万吨的矿质肥料。仅是平安北道就获得八千三百八十吨化学肥料。
    苏联在文化方面也给予朝鲜人民很大的帮助。有许多朝鲜男女青年学生都在苏联高等学校中读书。有一部分在苏联学成以后，现已回到祖国积极参加祖国恢复工作。有三百一十三名在苏联高等学校毕业的专家现已在朝鲜国民经济各部门以及科学和文化部门工作。苏联经常运来大批的文艺、政治和技术方面的书籍，还有影片，这些影片都在全国各地上演。
    当庆祝朝苏经济文化互助协定签订五周年的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的劳动人民对苏联人民的无私援助表示感谢，并表示决心要更加巩固朝苏人民之间的友谊。
