    Introduction to the Korean People's Delegation to China
    The Korean People's Delegation to China is a broad united front organization. The delegation consists of forty official representatives, as well as thirteen staff members. Among the representatives are leaders of various democratic parties and social organizations, heroes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who have made outstanding contributions in the Fatherland Liberation War, advanced figures on the production front—labor heroes, model workers, model farmers—as well as famous writers, artists, meritorious actors, and scientific and educational workers. Among the representatives is also Choi Young, the Korean boy who was rescued from an ice cave on January 2, 1952, by Luo Shengjiao, a special-class meritorious hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers and an immortal internationalist fighter. He will go to Tongzi Village, Songshan Township, Xinhua County, Hunan Province, to visit his Chinese father, Luo Diekai.
    Accompanying the delegation on its visit to our country are the Korean People's Army Ensemble, the Korean National Art Theater, and the Korean National Classical Art Theater, three artistic groups that will extensively perform in our country.
    The Korean People's Delegation to China is scheduled to visit our country for three months. Through the delegation's visit, the unbreakable and eternal brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples will be further consolidated and developed, and the cultural exchange between the two peoples will be further strengthened.
