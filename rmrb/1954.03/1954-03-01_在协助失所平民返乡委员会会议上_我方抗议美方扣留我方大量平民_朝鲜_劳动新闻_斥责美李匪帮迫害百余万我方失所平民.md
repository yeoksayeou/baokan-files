Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 28th: At the meeting of the Committee to Assist Displaced Civilians in Returning Home on February 27th, our side lodged a strong protest against the US side's flagrant violation of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement and its illegal act of forcibly detaining a large number of our civilians.

During the war, the US side forcibly abducted a large number of civilians from our areas temporarily occupied by it. Even after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the US side once again abducted many of our civilians from our rear coastal islands from which it withdrew. Among the aforementioned islands, the residents of fifteen islands were entirely abducted by the US side during its withdrawal after the ceasefire. According to the US side, the number of our displaced civilians forcibly abducted by the US side reached as many as 1.5 million. They are forced to be displaced and are living in extreme poverty in the US side's area, so it is inevitable that many people want to return home.

However, on February 18th, the US side notified our side that it was only prepared to allow 70 of our displaced civilians to return home. On February 27th, the US side further overturned the already completely absurd figure it had proposed, and openly stated that it would only return 38 of our displaced civilians.

At the meeting on February 27th, our side pointed out to the US side that the approximate number of 70 previously proposed by the US side had already fully exposed its policy of forcibly detaining our civilians. Now the US side is even using shameless means to detain a portion of these 70, making the US side's policy of forcibly detaining our civilians even more exposed. Our side finally firmly demanded that the US side truly implement the provisions of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement and return all of our displaced civilians abducted by it.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 28th: "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 26th entitled "The US Side Must Seriously Carry Out the Work of Assisting Our Displaced Civilians to Return Home."

The commentary wrote: Our side never adopted the policy of forcibly abducting civilians from occupied areas as adopted by the other side during the war. Moreover, the actual situation of the progress and changes of the war made it almost impossible for civilians to move north during the war. Therefore, there are virtually no displaced civilians from the other side in our area. The very few civilians who moved to our area during the war have not yet registered to return home, because they are living a free and happy life under the deep care and attention of the government of the Republic. They are unwilling to return to the area under the dark rule of the US-Li gang.

The commentary pointed out: In South Korea, under the military control of the other side, there is a large number of displaced civilians abducted from our area. According to the figures published by the US side alone, there are as many as 1.5 million people. These displaced civilians are living a miserable life of unemployment, illness and hunger under the abuse and persecution of the US-Li gang. Some of them are wandering on the streets begging for food, and some of them are forcibly accommodated in so-called "refugee camps," suffering from extreme malnutrition and various diseases without anyone caring about them. The pseudo-"Chosun Ilbo" in Seoul revealed that more than 80,000 civilians abducted by the US side in Hungnam, Hamgyongnam-do, have been imprisoned in tents and earthen caves on Geoje Island for three years, receiving only one to three "he" of miscellaneous grains every day and suffering from hunger. They had requested jobs from the Li Seung-man pseudo-government's Ministry of Social Affairs, but were unreasonably rejected. In addition, on several islands under US control on the west coast, such as Yeonpyeong, Baekpyeong (transliteration), Daecheong, and Socheong, there are also about 40,000 displaced civilians wandering around, lacking food and housing, and 850 households are living in the open on the islands.

The commentary pointed out: Our displaced civilians, who are forcibly abducted and are now living a miserable life, are eager to return to their hometowns. However, the US-Li gang is suppressing and trampling on their legitimate desire. The US side has already stated that it is only prepared to assist about 70 displaced civilians to return to our side. The Li Seung-man gang even openly clamored: "We will never return these people." The reason why the US-Li gang is obstructing our displaced civilians from returning home is, on the one hand, because they are afraid that these displaced civilians will further expose the truth about South Korea under the dark rule of the US-Li gang after returning home; on the other hand, they are attempting to forcibly detain these displaced civilians to serve as cannon fodder and slaves.

The commentary emphasized: The Korean people resolutely oppose and condemn the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Li Seung-man gang to obstruct our displaced civilians from returning home, and resolutely demand that the US side earnestly assist our displaced civilians who are willing to return home to return to their hometowns.

    在协助失所平民返乡委员会会议上
    我方抗议美方扣留我方大量平民
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”斥责美李匪帮迫害百余万我方失所平民
    【新华社开城二十八日电】在二月二十七日的协助失所平民返乡委员会的会议上，我方对美方悍然破坏停战协定第五十九款的规定、强制扣留大量我方平民的非法行为提出强硬抗议。
    在战争期间，美方曾自它所暂时占领的我方地区用武力掳走大量平民，甚至在停战协定签订后，美方还在它所撤出的我方后方沿海岛屿中，再一次掳走我方的许多平民。在上述岛屿中，有十五个岛屿的居民竟全部为美方在停战后撤出时所掳走。据美方自称，上述为美方所强制掳走的我方失所平民为数达一百五十万之多。他们被迫流离失所，正在美方地区过着极端贫困的生活，因此必然有许多人是要回家的。
    但美方在二月十八日竟通知我方称，美方仅准备让七十名我方失所平民返乡，到二月二十七日美方更推翻它所提出的本已完全荒谬的数字，公然表示：仅将送还我方失所平民三十八人。
    我方在二月二十七日会上向美方指出：美方前所提出的七十名概数，本来就已充分暴露了它强迫扣留我方平民的政策，现在美方竟还在这七十名中，以无耻手段再行扣留一部分，使美方强迫扣留我方平民的政策更加暴露无遗。我方最后坚决要求美方真正执行停战协定第五十九款的规定，送还它所掳走的全部我方失所平民。
     【新华社平壤二十八日电】“劳动新闻”二十六日发表了一篇题为“美方必须认真地进行协助我方失所平民返乡的工作”的评论。
    评论写道：我方在战争期间从未采用对方所采用的强迫掳走占领区平民的政策，而且战争的进行和变化的实际状况又使得平民在战争过程中几乎不可能向北迁移，因此在我方地区内事实上就几乎没有对方的失所平民。而在战时迁到我方地区的极少数平民，到现在为止还未有人愿意返乡而进行登记，因为他们在共和国政府的深切关怀和照顾下，都过着安居乐业的自由生活。他们都不愿意返回美李匪帮黑暗统治下的地区。
    评论指出：在对方军事控制下的南朝鲜，有着从我方地区掳走的大批失所平民。仅据美方发表的数字，也有一百五十万人之多。这些失所平民正在美李匪帮的虐待和迫害下，过着失业、病痛和饥饿的悲惨生活。其中一部分人流浪在街头依靠乞食为生，一部分人被强迫收容在所谓“难民收容所”中，营养极度不足，患着各种疾病而无人过问。汉城的伪“朝鲜日报”曾透露，美方在咸镜南道兴南掳走的八万多名平民，三年来一直被囚禁在巨济岛的帐篷和土窟里，每天只能领到一合到三合的杂粮，挨受着饥饿。他们曾向李承晚伪政府社会部要求职业，但是遭到无理拒绝。此外，在西海岸美方控制下的延坪、白坪（译音）、大青、小青等几个岛屿上，也流浪着约四万名失所平民，他们缺少食粮和房屋，有八百五十户露宿在岛上。
    评论指出：被强迫掳走的现在正过着悲惨生活的我方失所平民，渴望着返回家乡。但是，美李匪帮却在压制和蹂躏着他们的这种正当的愿望。美方已经声称，它仅准备协助约七十名失所平民回至我方。李承晚匪帮更公开扬言：“决不交还这些人”。美李匪帮所以阻挠我方失所平民返乡，一方面是害怕这些失所平民返乡以后会进一步揭露美李匪帮黑暗统治下的南朝鲜真相；另一方面是企图把这些失所平民强迫扣留，充当炮灰和奴隶。
    评论强调指出：朝鲜人民坚决反对和斥责美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮阻挠我方失所平民返乡的阴谋，并坚决要求美方认真地协助愿意返乡的我方失所平民返回家乡。
