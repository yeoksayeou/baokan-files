Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on March 22nd: General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote a letter congratulating the Vietnamese People's Army, People's Army local forces, militia, and guerrillas who recently launched an offensive against the French army's defense system on Highway 5, connecting Haiphong and Hanoi, and achieved victory.

The congratulatory letter said that after destroying many enemy trains in January and February 1954, you recently launched a series of offensives against the enemy's defense system on Highway 5, removing some enemy strongholds and watchtowers, defeating many enemy reinforcements, and destroying many bridges and railways, repeatedly cutting off this most important strategic transportation line of the French army in Indochina, hindering the transportation of American weapons and ammunition from Haiphong port to Hanoi and various battlefields. Therefore, your actions have been closely coordinated with the victories in Dien Bien Phu and other battlefields.

The congratulatory letter pointed out that the victorious battles fought by the Vietnamese People's Army against the enemy's defense system on Highway 5, like the successful attacks on the French army's Gia Lam and Cat Bi airfields, demonstrated the invincible strength of our military and civilians behind enemy lines. It also proved the failure of the enemy's plot to "pacify" the Red River Delta region behind their lines.

In the conclusion of the congratulatory letter, General Võ Nguyên Giáp called on the troops who had achieved victory on Highway 5 to consolidate and further expand their gains.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on March 22nd: The Vietnamese People's Army cut off the railway line from Haiphong to Hanoi used by the French army and attacked enemy troops in Hà Nam and Vĩnh Phúc provinces.

From March 11th to 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army destroyed approximately 20 kilometers of the railway line running parallel to Highway 5 from Haiphong to Hanoi, making it more difficult for the enemy to transport military supplies on this line.

Also, on March 17th, the Vietnamese People's Army local forces ambushed two enemy motorized regiments near the Phương Khê stronghold, located six kilometers from the capital of Hà Nam province, killing and capturing a total of 166 enemy soldiers, destroying two tanks, and capturing one 57mm caliber cannon, 16 machine guns, and a large number of rifles.

On March 14th, Vietnamese People's armed forces attacked and removed the enemy stronghold of Tam Dương, three kilometers west of Vĩnh Yên city in Vĩnh Phúc province. On the same day, the French army stronghold of Thanh Gia, three kilometers east of the city, was also removed by the People's armed forces.

    武元甲将军祝贺袭击第五号公路有功部队
    越南人民军破坏海防河内间铁路线约二十公里
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军写信祝贺最近在连接海防和河内的第五号公路上对法军防御体系发动进攻并取得胜利的越南人民军、人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队。
    贺信说，你们在一九五四年一月和二月份炸毁了许多列敌军火车后，又在最近对第五号公路上的敌军防御体系发动了一连串的进攻，拔除了一些敌军据点和了望塔，击溃了许多敌军增援部队，破坏了许多桥梁和铁路，一再切断法军在印度支那这一条最重要的战略运输线，使美国武器和弹药自海防港运到河内以及各个战场上去受到了阻碍。因此，你们的行动已经与奠边府以及其他战场上战斗的胜利密切配合起来。
    贺信中指出：越南人民军在第五号公路上对敌军防御体系进行的胜利战斗，跟对嘉林和吉碑法军机场进行的成功的袭击一样，表现了我们在敌后的军民的不可战胜的力量，同时还证明了敌军想“绥靖”他们战线后方红河三角洲地区的阴谋的失败。
    武元甲将军在贺信的最后号召在第五号公路上取得胜利的部队，巩固并进一步扩大战果。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：越南人民军切断了法军从海防到河内的铁路，并在河南、永福两省攻击敌军。
    三月十一日到十三日，越南人民军破坏了从海防通往河内、与第五号公路平行的铁路线约二十公里，使这条线路上敌人的军运遭到更大的困难。
    又讯：三月十七日，越南人民军地方部队在距河南省省会六公里的方溪据点附近截击敌军的两个机动团，共毙、俘敌军一百六十六人，击毁坦克两辆；并缴获五七口径的炮一门、机枪十六挺以及大批步枪。
    三月十四日，越南人民武装攻击并拔除了永福省永安城以西三公里的敌军据点三阳。同一天，该城以东三公里的法军据点清嘉也被人民武装拔除。
