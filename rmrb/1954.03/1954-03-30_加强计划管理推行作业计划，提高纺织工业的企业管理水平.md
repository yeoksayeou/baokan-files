Strengthen Plan Management and Promote Work Planning to Improve the Enterprise Management Level of the Textile Industry
Fang Ze

To meet the growing needs of the people for textiles, this year's production and capital construction tasks of China's textile industry have increased significantly compared with last year. The tasks are quite heavy, requiring the joint efforts of all comrades in the textile industry. To successfully complete this year's production and capital construction tasks, the textile industry must continue to strengthen plan management, implement work planning as the central task, and around this center, further strengthen the leadership of technical work, promote advanced experience, carry out labor competitions, and establish a factory director responsibility system and production area management system and related responsibility systems in a planned manner; continue to improve labor organization, vigorously train cadres, strengthen financial and cost management, and gradually implement economic accounting, so as to improve the level of enterprise management, achieve the goals of developing production, improving quality, practicing economy, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity.

Why should the textile industry focus on continuing to strengthen plan management and implement work planning this year? This is primarily because: although the textile industry's production has grown significantly in recent years, the level of enterprise management has not kept pace with the development of production. The foundation of plan management is weak, the completion of plans is not comprehensive, and production is uneven. Many enterprises are still only satisfied with the completion of product plans, and do not pay enough attention to the completion of quality, cost, financial, and labor plans. In a region or an enterprise, the annual and quarterly averages generally can complete the plan, but the comprehensive and balanced completion of plans by each enterprise (or each workshop, work section, or team within an enterprise) on a monthly, weekly, daily, or per machine basis is poorly done. For example, last year among the state-owned cotton textile factories, only seventeen factories could complete the cotton yarn plan monthly, and only nine factories could complete the cotton cloth plan monthly. Some enterprises even failed to complete the plan for more than half the time. As a result, the supply between the front and rear processes in enterprise production is disconnected, and crash work such as overtime cannot be fundamentally eliminated. Among state-owned textile enterprises, the difference between advanced and backward enterprises is still very large in terms of output alone. Currently, well-managed factories have achieved an annual output of 1.06 pieces of cotton yarn per spindle, while poorly managed factories have only 0.872 pieces. Many factories still lack accurate and sound original records, which cannot play a role in supervising and guiding production; quota management is crude, lacking practical average advanced quotas; and leaders of general enterprises are not well-informed about the production situation of the enterprise; plans have not yet been mastered by the broad masses of workers. To change these situations and improve the level of enterprise management, it is necessary to strengthen plan management and implement work planning.

Secondly, the textile industry is a modern, large-scale, continuous, and complex production, but the so-called "continuity" is by no means the "natural equilibrium" as some comrades say, because the textile industry is not only continuous but also complex. In the production process, various interruptions are inevitable. Such as the interruption of machine loading (winding), the interruption of removing finished products (doffing, taking off the machine), the interruption of repairs, the interruption of changing varieties, the interruption of the technological process (thread breakage, machine stoppage), the interruption of semi-finished product supply. There are also interruptions due to technical reasons, as well as interruptions due to labor organization (absenteeism), etc. Of course, the degree of various interruptions in each enterprise is different. Although some of these interruptions are required for production, others can be avoided or shortened. Overly long or excessive or uncoordinated interruptions (such as doffing collisions) in the production process are one of the main reasons for uneven production and hindering the potential of enterprises. In order to minimize various interruptions in the production process and make them proceed rhythmically, so as to give full play to the production efficiency of equipment, it is necessary to strengthen plan management and organize balanced production.

Again, the characteristic of textile machinery and equipment is multiple machines, and the configuration is relatively fixed. The equipment in each process section is a large number of the same type of equipment, producing the same type of products. Due to this feature, it is possible to tap potential on the basis of the original equipment. Currently, the efficiency of machines in textile enterprises is unbalanced. For example, in the North Weaving Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai First Cotton Textile Factory, the unit output of the same loom is 4.727 yards per hour for the highest, and 4.572 yards for the lowest. If the lowest loom can reach the hourly output level of the highest loom, it can increase the production of 70,000 pieces of cotton cloth per year. Of course, it is difficult to require all machines to have absolutely consistent production efficiency, but we should and can minimize this difference. In order to achieve this goal, the balance of production capacity of each machine, the allocation of labor, and the arrangement of machine stoppage and maintenance work, and technical operations must be organically organized.

All of the above shows that the textile industry must focus on continuing to strengthen plan management and implement work planning this year. With work planning, the enterprise's plan can be specifically assigned to each workshop, work section, team, and each worker on a monthly, weekly, daily, and shift basis, and the corresponding tasks should be specified for other auxiliary workshops and functional departments, such as how to coordinate maintenance and operation, how to supply raw materials in a timely manner, and how the technical department should formulate technical measures to address the weak links in production. So that the various departments of the enterprise are organically and closely organized, driving the general work forward, so as to achieve a balanced and comprehensive completion and over-completion of the national plan, and to improve the level of enterprise management. Only by focusing on strengthening plan management and implementing work planning can we strengthen the technical leadership of enterprises and establish various responsibility systems. Those who believe that it is not necessary to implement work planning in the textile industry, or that plan management in the textile industry is not as important as in other industries, are incorrect and should be corrected.

It should be pointed out that the content of work planning in the textile industry is not exactly the same as the content of work planning in other industries, because the vast majority of the textile industry belongs to mass production, and the formulation of work planning is not exactly the same as in other industries. In the textile industry, work planning should usually take product output (including varieties) and equipment utilization as the regular and basic content, but it should also include the amount of raw materials needed and the organizational and technical measures to ensure the completion of the work planning, etc. In addition, it is necessary to analyze and study the execution of various plans of the enterprise, find out the main weak links, and formulate necessary indicators.

The guiding principle of the textile industry in 1954 to continue to strengthen plan management and promote work planning to improve enterprise management has basically achieved a unified understanding at the recent National State-owned Textile Factory Directors Conference convened by the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government. To ensure the smooth progress of this principle, textile enterprises must, first, combine strengthening plan management and promoting work planning with strengthening the leadership of technical work, especially strengthening technical and organizational measures. Due to the implementation of work planning, it can timely and specifically reflect the production situation of the enterprise and the key problems existing in production. The leaders of the enterprise's technical work can formulate effective technical measures to address the key problems in production, and can proactively take various preventive measures in technical work to overcome the weak links in production and ensure the completion of production tasks. Strengthening plan management and implementing work planning provides a clear goal for technical leadership work, which can correct the generalization and passivity of the current technical leadership work of enterprises. At the same time, after the technical leadership work is strengthened, the implementation of work planning will have a practical guarantee. Second, it is also necessary to combine strengthening plan management and promoting work planning with the implementation of the factory director responsibility system, the production area management system, and the establishment of various responsibility systems. The implementation of the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system is also one of the important tasks of the textile industry this year. This work should be carried out in a planned manner and closely combined with the central work of the enterprise, otherwise the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system will not be easily implemented, and other various responsibility systems will not be easily established. At the same time, strengthening plan management and promoting work planning also requires enterprises to implement the production area management system and establish a clear specialized responsibility system. Therefore, only by combining the implementation of the factory director responsibility system and the production area management system and the establishment of various responsibility systems with strengthening plan management and promoting work planning can plan management work be truly strengthened and work planning be truly promoted.

It must be recognized that work planning is a new and meticulous organizational work, and textile enterprises must make full preparations before implementation. The preparation work should first unify understanding and clarify the importance of implementing work planning in current textile enterprises. Secondly, organizational preparations should be made to clarify the division of responsibilities of leaders at all levels and various functional departments in the implementation of work planning. Establish production dispatching work and related responsibility systems. In addition, technical and business preparations should also be made, such as analyzing the current plan execution situation of the enterprise, inspecting equipment conditions, and determining indicator items, formulating various necessary forms, etc.

The implementation of work planning must prevent the deviation of greed for quantity and speed or formalism. In the textile industry, the implementation of work planning should start with production planning combined with technical measures and maintenance work, and then gradually promote it comprehensively. When carrying out work in specific areas, pilot projects can be carried out first, and after gaining experience, they can be actively and systematically promoted. At the same time, different requirements and deployments should be made for enterprises with different production products and different foundations for plan management.

    加强计划管理推行作业计划，提高纺织工业的企业管理水平
    方泽
    为了适应人民群众对纺织品日益增长的需要，今年我国纺织工业的生产和基本建设任务，比去年都有很大增长，任务相当繁重，它需要纺织工业部门的全体同志以很大的努力来完成。为了胜利地完成纺织工业今年的生产任务和基本建设任务，纺织工业部门必须以继续加强计划管理贯彻作业计划为中心，围绕这一中心，进一步加强技术工作的领导，推广先进经验，开展劳动竞赛，有步骤地建立厂长负责制和生产区域管理制及其有关的责任制度；继续改善劳动组织，大力培养干部，加强财务成本管理，逐步贯彻经济核算制，把企业管理水平提高一步，以达到发展生产、提高质量、厉行节约、降低成本、提高劳动生产率的目的。
    为什么今年纺织工业要以继续加强计划管理贯彻作业计划为中心呢？这首先是因为：纺织工业几年来生产虽有很大的增长，但企业管理水平还赶不上生产的发展，计划管理基础不强，完成计划不全面，生产不均衡。不少企业还只满足于产品计划的完成，对质量、成本、财务以及劳动计划的完成不够注意。在一个地区或一个企业中，年度季度平均一般都能完成计划，但各个企业（或一个企业中的各个工场、车间、小组）按月、按周、按日、按每个机台均衡地全面地完成计划，则作得很差，如去年国营棉纺织厂中，能按月完成棉纱计划的只十七个厂，按月完成棉布计划的只九个厂，甚至某些企业有一半以上的时间不能完成计划。因而企业生产中前后工序供应脱节，加班加点等突击现象不能根本消除。在国营纺织企业中先进与落后企业之间仅产量一项，相差也仍然很大，目前管理较好的厂，棉纱每锭年产量已达到一·○六件，而管理比较差的厂，只有○·八七二件。有不少厂原始记录还不够正确和健全，不能起监督和指导生产的作用；定额管理粗糙，缺乏切合实际的平均先进定额；一般企业领导者对企业生产情况还不够心中有数；计划尚未被广大职工群众掌握。而要改变这些情况，提高企业管理水平，就必须加强计划管理，贯彻作业计划。
    其次，纺织工业是近代化大规模的连续性的复杂的生产，但所谓“连续性”，绝不是象某些同志所说的“自然的均衡”，因为纺织工业不仅是连续性的而且是复杂的生产，在生产过程中不可避免的仍有各种间断。如机器上件的间断（上盘头），卸除成品的间断（落纱、了机），修理的间断，翻改品种的间断，工艺过程的间断（断头、停台），半制品供应的间断。还有技术原因的间断，以及劳动组织上原因的间断（缺勤）等等。当然每个企业中的各种间断程度是有不同的。这些间断虽然有的是生产所需要的，但有的却是可以避免或缩短的。生产过程中过长或过多或不协调（如碰头落纱）的间断，是造成生产不均衡和阻碍企业潜力发挥的主要原因之一，为了使生产过程中的各种间断减少到最小限度，并使其有节奏地进行，以充分发挥设备生产效率，就必须加强计划管理，组织均衡生产。
    再次，纺织工业的机器设备的特点是多机台，而且配置比较固定，它在每一工段的设备是大量同一种类型的设备，生产同一种类型的制品。由于这一特点，就有可能在原有设备的基础上来挖掘潜力。目前纺织企业中的机台效率是不平衡的，如国营上海第一棉纺织厂北织车间，同样的布机单位产量，最高的台时产量为四点七二七码，最低的为四点五七二码，如果最低的机台能达到最高机台的台时产量水平，则全年能增产棉布七万匹。当然，要求所有机台的生产效率绝对一致是很困难的，但我们也应该而且可能使这种差异缩小到最小限度。为了达到这个目的，在每一机台生产能力的平衡上，劳动力的调配上，及机械停台、检修工作的安排上，技术操作上，就必须有机地加以组织。
    以上这些，都说明纺织工业目前必须以继续加强计划管理、推行作业计划为中心。有了作业计划，才可把企业的计划按月、按周、按日、按班的具体分配到各工场、车间、小组和每个工人，并对其他辅助车间、职能科室规定其应负的任务，如保全保养与运转如何配合，原材料如何及时供应，技术部门如何针对生产上的薄弱环节制订技术措施等。使企业的各个部门有机地紧密地组织起来，带动一般工作前进，从而达到均衡地全面地完成和超额完成国家计划，并使企业管理水平提高一步。
    在纺织工业中推行作业计划，去年有些地方已进行了重点试验。这些企业推行作业计划的结果已使生产管理情况开始有了改善；前松后紧、加班加点、生产不均衡的现象，已逐渐得到克服，产品、产量、质量和劳动生产率一般已有提高；半成品储备量的掌握已有改善，资金周转也较前加速，技术措施、保全保养和前后供应等也均有了不同程度的改进；个别企业并已建立了生产调度工作及某些责任制度。这些事实都证明纺织工业只有加强计划管理，推行作业计划，才能发挥企业的潜力，提高企业的管理水平。只有围绕加强计划管理、推行作业计划这一中心，才能加强企业的技术领导工作，建立起各种责任制度，那些认为在纺织工业中不需要推行作业计划，或认为纺织工业计划管理不如其他工业重要等思想，是不正确的，是应该加以纠正的。
    应当指出：纺织工业中作业计划的内容，和其他工业中作业计划的内容是不完全一样的，因为纺织工业绝大多数都属于大量生产，制定作业计划和其他工业是不完全相同的。在纺织工业中作业计划通常应以产品产量（包括品种）和设备利用为经常的基本的内容，但同时也应包括原材料需要量及保证作业计划完成的组织技术措施等内容，此外还必须根据企业各种计划的执行情况，进行分析研究，找出主要的薄弱环节，制订必要的指标。
    纺织工业一九五四年以继续加强计划管理推行作业计划为中心，这一改进企业管理的方针，在最近中央人民政府纺织工业部召开的全国国营纺织厂厂长会议中，基本上已取得统一的认识，为保证这一方针顺利进行，纺织企业在推行作业计划时，第一，必须把加强计划管理推行作业计划和加强技术工作的领导、特别是加强技术组织措施工作结合起来。由于作业计划的推行，就可以及时、具体地反映企业生产情况和生产中存在的关键问题，企业的技术工作领导者就可针对生产中的关键问题来制订有效的技术措施，并可有预见性的在技术工作上采取各种预防措施，借以克服生产中的薄弱环节，保证生产任务的完成。加强了计划管理，推行了作业计划，使技术领导工作有了明确的目标，就可以纠正当前企业技术领导工作的一般化与被动现象，同时技术领导工作加强以后，作业计划的贯彻也就有了切实的保证。第二，还必须把加强计划管理推行作业计划与实行厂长负责制、生产区域管理制及建立各种责任制结合起来。实行厂长负责制和生产区域管理制也是纺织工业今年的重要工作之一。这一工作在进行时应是有步骤的和企业的中心工作密切结合，否则厂长负责制及生产区域管理制就不容易贯彻，其他各种责任制度也不容易建立起来。同时加强计划管理，推行作业计划也需要企业实行生产区域管理制和建立明确的专责制，所以也只有把贯彻厂长负责制和生产区域管理制及建立各种责任制度，与加强计划管理推行作业计划结合起来，计划管理工作才能真正加强，作业计划才能真正推行。
    必须认识：作业计划是一项新的细密的组织工作，纺织企业在推行前必须做好充分的准备工作。准备工作首先应该统一认识，明确在目前纺织企业中推行作业计划的重要性。其次应该做好组织准备，明确各级领导与各职能部门在推行作业计划上的职责分工。建立生产调度工作及有关的责任制度。此外，并应做好技术上和业务上的准备，如分析本企业目前计划执行情况，检查设备状况，以及确定指标项目，制订各种必要的表式等。
    推行作业计划要防止贪多图快或形式主义的偏向。在纺织工业中推行作业计划，应先由生产计划结合技术措施及保全保养工作做起，然后再逐渐全面推广。各地区在具体进行工作时，可先进行重点试验，待取得经验后，再积极地有步骤地推广。同时对生产成品不同和计划管理工作基础不同的企业，也应有不同的要求和部署。
