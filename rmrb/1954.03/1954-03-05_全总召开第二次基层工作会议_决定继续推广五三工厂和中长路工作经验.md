Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: The Second Grassroots Work Conference of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has determined to continue promoting the work experience of Factory 53, and at the same time learn from the work experience of the former China Chang Railway, in order to further advance the labor emulation drive.

The conference reviewed and studied the situation of various regions in promoting the work experience of Factory 53 over the past year. Since the first National Trade Union Grassroots Work Conference was held in November 1952, 74 factories and mines across the country have focused on promoting the work experience of Factory 53. Some factory and mine trade unions, due to their earnest study and promotion of the experience of Factory 53, have effectively oriented themselves towards production, and around production, improved their working methods, launched labor emulation drives, and ensured the completion and over-completion of state plans; some of these factories and mines have changed their past backward state and become advanced factories and mines. The facts of the past year have proven that promoting the experience of Factory 53 is a good way to strengthen the grassroots work of trade unions and promote labor emulation drives.

At the meeting, Qi Tinghan, chairman of the Factory 53 trade union, reported on "The Trade Union's Work Experience in Planned Management in Factory 53." The Party Branch Secretary of the Second Workshop of the factory, as well as the Deputy Secretary of the Youth League Committee and the Women's Work Committee of the trade union, also introduced their work experience. From these reports, it can be seen that the experience of Factory 53 has had new developments in strengthening planned management work. Under the guidance of the idea of resolutely relying on the working class to manage enterprises well, they have launched labor emulation drives around the implementation of operation plans, ensuring the over-fulfillment of state plans. In their work, they have used the working methods of the mass line such as "grasping ideology," "grasping key points," "grasping typical examples," and "using activists," and strengthened the work of departments and rectified the order of trade union work according to the needs of production.

Ma Yin, chairman of the Harbin District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, reported at this meeting on "Learning from and Promoting the Experience of the China Chang Railway in Organizing Patriotic Labor Emulation." The Deputy Secretary of the Changchun Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Director and Trade Union Chairman of the Changchun Locomotive Depot, the Branch Secretary of the Freight Car Branch of the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and the Trade Union Chairman of the Sujiatun Station also respectively made reports on administrative work, Party work, and trade union work. In these reports, they introduced how the former China Chang Railway, during the period of Sino-Soviet co-management, became an advanced model railway with "high efficiency, low cost, high profits, and culture" under the specific guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. They also specifically introduced the former China Chang Railway's implementation of the economic accounting system, organization of labor emulation drives, signing of collective contracts, implementation of technical organization measures, holding of production meetings and trade union member congresses, Party organization supervision and guarantee of enterprise production, and holding of branch congresses, and other complete set of experiences. In addition, the vice chairman of the trade union of the Steel Refining Construction Engineering Company of Anshan Iron and Steel Company reported on the trade union work of the company's large-scale construction site, and the chairman of the trade union of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory reported on the rectification of the trade union work order in the factory.

The meeting discussed the above reports and unanimously agreed that the work experiences of Factory 53 and the former China Chang Railway are relatively complete and worthy of learning. The meeting also focused on studying the issues of trade unions assisting enterprise administrations in improving the level of enterprise production management, carrying out labor emulation drives, and rectifying and establishing the order of trade union work. The meeting believed that in order to enable trade union work to further face production, especially to enable trade unions to undertake the task of organizing labor emulation drives, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational construction of the trade unions themselves. This requires first changing the situation of grassroots trade unions with complex business, unreasonable organizational structures, and chaotic work, and effectively rectifying and establishing the order of trade union work. The meeting believed that trade unions in various regions should refer to the experience of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory Trade Union in clarifying the scope of work, adjusting organizations, and improving work systems, so as to make trade union work catch up with the needs of production.

This meeting was held from December 16th to 31st last year.

    全总召开第二次基层工作会议
    决定继续推广五三工厂和中长路工作经验
    【新华社三日讯】中华全国总工会第二次基层工作会议确定继续推广五三工厂工作经验，同时并学习原中长铁路的工作经验，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。
    会议检查研究了一年来各地推广五三工厂工作经验的情况。自一九五二年十一月第一次全国工会基层工作会议召开以后，全国有七十四个厂矿已经着重推广了五三工厂的工作经验。有些厂矿工会，由于认真学习和推广了五三工厂经验，已经切实面向生产，并且围绕生产，改进工作方法，开展劳动竞赛，保证了国家计划的完成和超额完成；其中一部分厂矿已经改变了过去的落后状态，成为先进的厂矿。一年来的事实证明：推广五三工厂经验是加强工会基层工作，推进劳动竞赛的好办法。
    会上，五三工厂工会主席齐廷汉报告了“五三工厂在计划管理中的工会工作经验”。该厂第二车间党支部书记及该厂青年团委副书记、工会女工委员也分别介绍了他们的工作经验。从这些报告中可以看出，五三工厂经验在加强计划管理工作中，已有了新的发展。他们在坚决依靠工人阶级管好企业的思想指导下，围绕推行作业计划，开展劳动竞赛，保证了国家计划超额完成。他们在工作中运用了“抓思想”、“抓关键”、“抓典型”、“运用积极分子”等走群众路线的工作方法，并根据生产需要，加强了科室工作，整顿了工会工作秩序。
    中国铁路工会哈尔滨区委员会主席马寅在这次会议上，报告了“学习和推广中长路组织爱国主义劳动竞赛的经验”。中共长春地区党委副书记、长春机务段段长和工会主席、哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂货车分厂支部书记、苏家屯车站工会主席等，也分别作了行政工作、党的工作和工会工作的报告。他们在这些报告中，介绍了原中长铁路在中苏共管期间，怎样在苏联专家的具体指导和帮助下成为
  “效率高、成本低、利润大、有文化”的先进模范铁路。他们并具体介绍了原中长铁路实行经济核算制、组织劳动竞赛、签订集体合同、推行技术组织措施、开好生产会议和工会会员大会、党组织监督和保证企业进行生产和开好支部大会等一整套经验。此外，鞍山钢铁公司炼钢建筑工程公司工会副主席报告了该公司大型工地的工会工作经验，沈阳第三机床厂工会主席报告了该厂整顿工会工作秩序的情况。
    会议讨论了以上各个报告，一致认为五三工厂和原中长铁路的工作经验都是比较完整的值得学习的经验。会议并集中研究了工会协助企业行政组织提高企业生产管理水平、开展劳动竞赛、整顿和建立工会工作秩序等问题。会议认为：为了使工会工作能够进一步面向生产，特别是要使工会担负起组织劳动竞赛的任务，就必须要加强工会本身的组织建设工作。这便需要首先改变基层工会业务繁杂、组织机构不合理、工作混乱等情况，切实整顿和建立工会工作秩序。会议认为：各地工会应参考沈阳第三机床厂工会划清工作范围、调整组织、健全工作制度等经验，使工会工作赶上生产的需要。
    这次会议是在去年十二月十六日到三十一日召开的。
