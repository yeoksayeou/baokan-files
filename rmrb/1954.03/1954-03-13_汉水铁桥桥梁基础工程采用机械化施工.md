    Mechanized Construction Adopted for Bridge Foundation Engineering of the Hanshui Iron Bridge

    A powerful construction force, consisting of universal pile drivers, derrick booms, crane ships, and other heavy machinery, has been assembled at the Hanshui Iron Bridge construction site. The most important and arduous tasks of the bridge foundation engineering, such as pile driving, lifting, cleaning bridge foundation silt, and mixing concrete, have all adopted mechanized construction. Many strenuous manual labor tasks that previously required carrying on shoulders and backs have been replaced by various machines here. The Hanshui Riverbed consists of alluvial deposits of silt mixed with sand, making it difficult to drive the thick, column-like concrete pipe piles into the ground using the conventional steam hammer piling method. To adapt to this special situation, workers have for the first time used universal pile drivers and electric high-pressure water pumps. Using this hydraulic machinery piling method, ten concrete pipe piles, each several tens of meters long, can be driven into the ground in a single day and night.

    In the Hanshui Iron Bridge project, thousands of tons of heavy construction equipment and machinery need to be transported back and forth on the construction site. These items are not only long, thick, and heavy, but also need to be transported from the shore to the river, or from the river to the shore. It is difficult to imagine the hardship if manual labor were used. The derrick boom, standing forty-six feet high on the bank of the Hanshui River, the four massive crane ships traversing the Hanshui River, and the three land-based crawler cranes are undertaking these heavy lifting and transport tasks. With a light sweep of its long arm, the derrick boom can accurately and quickly transport items weighing fifteen to forty-five tons up and down within a forty-meter radius. The largest of the crane ships can lift seventy-five tons, while the remaining three can each lift thirty tons. They can also perform pile driving work on the water. Currently, a series of arduous tasks such as underwater pile driving, constructing steel sheet pile cofferdams, and installing seventy-ton cofferdam support timber frames are being undertaken by these four crane ships. Four mud flushing machines and suction dredgers are removing hundreds and thousands of cubic meters of silt from the bridge pier foundations. Modernized, telephone-equipped diving equipment ensures the safe operation of divers in the deep, fast-flowing river. More than twenty concrete mixing machines have also begun operating to pour concrete for the foundation of the No. 4 bridge pier.

    Most of these powerful machines are domestically produced after the liberation of our country. For example, electric high-pressure water pumps and other low-pressure water pumps are mostly newly manufactured in Shenyang. Various motors come from Shanghai. The largest number of concrete mixing machines are products of machinery factories in Central South, East China, and North China.

### 汉水铁桥桥梁基础工程采用机械化施工

    汉水铁桥桥梁基础工程采用机械化施工
    万能打桩机、德立克把杆、起重船等重型机具在汉水铁桥工地上组成了一支强大的施工力量。桥梁基础工程最主要和最繁重的打桩、起重、清理桥基淤泥、拌合混凝土等工作都已采用机械化施工。许多以前要肩挑背扛的费力劳动，在这里已为各种机械所代替。汉水河底是淤泥掺沙的冲积层，按照通常用蒸汽锤打桩的方法，很难把粗大如柱的混凝土管桩打进地底。适应这种特殊情况，工人们第一次运用了万能打桩机和电动高压水泵。采用这种水力机械打桩的方法，一昼夜间能把十根几十公尺长的混凝土管桩打进地底。
    在汉水铁桥工程中，有成千上万吨的笨重施工器材和机具要在工地上往返运输，这些东西不仅又长又粗又重，而且要从岸上送到河上，或从河上接到岸上，如用人力劳动其困难是难以想像的。立在汉水河畔的高达四十六尺的德立克把杆、四艘横行汉水河上的庞大起重船以及三部陆上爬行吊车，就担负了这些繁重的起重和搬运任务。德立克把杆只要轻舒长臂，就可以在四十公尺半径的圆周内，准确而迅速地把十五吨到四十五吨重的东西上下运送。起重船最大的一艘能吊重七十五吨，其余三艘各吊重三十吨。它们在水上还能进行打桩工作。现在水下打桩、修筑钢板围堰以及安放七十吨重的围堰支撑木架等一系列艰苦的工作，都是由这四艘起重船担负的。四部冲泥机和吸泥机正把成百上千方的淤泥从桥墩基础处清除出去。近代化的、能通电话的潜水设备，保证着潜水员在水深流急的河中安全工作。二十多部混凝土拌合机也开始为浇灌四号桥墩基础混凝土开动起来了。
    所有这些威力强大的机械，大部分是我国解放后的国产品。如电动高压水泵和其他低压水泵大都是沈阳新造的。各种马达来自上海。数量最多的混凝土拌合机则是中南、华东、华北各机械工厂的产品。
