    Father and Son
    By Our Correspondent Shen Shi
    The first time I met him was on the train from Lanzhou to Dachaigou (a section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway).

    He and a young woman were sitting across from me. They were dressed neatly. The woman had a clean towel wrapped around her head, and a light blue cotton-padded jacket under her black leather overcoat. Their bulky luggage was on the luggage rack. I guessed that these two passengers were probably going to a faraway place.

    It was a little after four o'clock in the morning, and the passengers were all dozing in their seats. He wiped away the ice that had frozen on the train window and kept looking out until the train crossed the Yellow River bridge, then turned back.

    "Old man! Where are you coming from?" I greeted him.
      "Luoyang."
      "Where are you going?" I asked.
      "To Wushaoling."
      "Going to the Wushaoling construction site?"
      "Yes, my son is driving a bulldozer there. I'm going to see him."
      "And her?" I said, pointing to the young woman.
      "Comrade! You can guess that without asking," the old man said. The woman's face flushed red.

    Later, I often saw him in the earthwork team. He lived in the bulldozer driver's dormitory. The young woman had already settled down with her husband.

    On the mountainside of Wushaoling, rows of workers' dormitories were built. These temporary dormitories were very similar to the cave dwellings of northern Shaanxi. The roofs were covered with a thick layer of mud, and living inside in the winter when the temperature was around minus thirty degrees Celsius was much warmer than in flimsy tents.

    Once, the drivers were studying the General Line for the Transition Period in the dormitory. I saw him sitting cross-legged on the bed, listening carefully to everyone's speeches. After the study session, I went up to him. Before I could speak, he called his son, Du Zhishan, over and introduced us. After we talked for a while, the old man began to tell me about his extraordinary journey.

    He happily took my hand and said, "When I got on the train, from Baoji to Lanzhou, and saw one tunnel after another, and the Wei River beside it, and the roadbed carved out from the side of the mountain, I thought: there is my son's contribution in this. Yesterday, I stood on the top of Dashagou mountain and personally saw him driving a bulldozer in the heavy snow. I felt indescribable happiness in my heart. I am proud of him, I feel comforted."

    The day after he arrived at Wushaoling, he walked the icy mountain road to visit the nearby tunnel projects. He saw thousands of workers, day and night, tirelessly excavating tunnels. He had been to Longgoubao and saw the towering piers standing tall on the Longgou River, with workers wearing safety belts, carrying out high-altitude operations with great intensity. He was encouraged by the spirit of the tunnel workers and bridge workers in overcoming all kinds of difficulties.

    One snowy night, he arrived at the Dashagou construction site. There, electric lights and searchlights illuminated the entire site like daytime. Bulldozers, root removers, and scrapers made rattling sounds. Young bulldozer drivers, braving the chaotic snowflakes, pushed the soil from two mountain tops into the deep ditch. They were going to fill the deep ditch with a roadbed as high as forty-five meters, and future trains would pass over it. He saw such a vast project for the first time, and saw his son driving a bulldozer for the first time, filling the deep ditch with soil pouring down from the mountain with his companions.

    How could this old man not be delighted to see his son and those bulldozer operators! When he first arrived, the bulldozer operators heard that Du Zhishan's father had come, and they spread the word, crowding around to ask questions, making space for him to sleep, and treating him like one of their own family. They worked like tigers, with an unknown source of energy. Whether in the waterless and bitter water areas on the Tianlan Road, or the frigid Wushaoling, they never bowed their heads to difficulties. During winter construction in Wushaoling, the frozen layer of the soil was more than one meter thick, and sometimes the frozen soil broke the bulldozer's blade. They removed the blade, attached a root remover, first loosened the frozen soil, and then pushed it with a bulldozer. They were fighting tenaciously against nature with their own wisdom and perseverance.

    Three years ago, Du Zhishan was still an apprentice in a silver shop. Since participating in the railway construction, and after being trained by the Party and veteran workers, he learned to drive a bulldozer. This young man gradually grew up in the people's railway team. Whenever Du Zhishan returned to the dormitory with his face covered in mud, the old man looked at him and slowly said, "Child! Work hard!"

    The son's day-by-day growth naturally made the old man happy. But when he thought of himself, there was bitterness and also joy. He had run a small business, but the small business did not make him rich. Later, he had to send his son to a silver shop to be an apprentice, and he himself had to return to Qianjingtou Village in Luoyang to farm. The nearby farmers heard that he had returned and said to him: "Du Zijing! Let's do our line of work! It is more reliable than doing business!" In this way, he guarded more than ten mu of land to barely support his family of seven. After liberation, he joined the mutual aid group, and his family situation slowly improved. Now he has also learned the General Line for the Transition Period of the State, and knows the path he will take in the future. This time, he came to Wushaoling, saw bulldozers, scrapers..., saw the production enthusiasm of the railway workers, and his horizons were even wider.

    He returned to the topic of this trip, using the difficulty of his past outings to explain this "unusual journey."

    It was a long time ago. He had been to Lanzhou, and there was no train at that time. Starting from Xi'an, it took a full twenty-five days, and he even encountered bandits on the road. This time, it only took a little over two days to get from Xi'an to Wushaoling. When he first stayed in Lanzhou, he heard people say: "Once you get to Wushaoling, your whole body will get cold." At that time, besides the Tibetan herders on the grassland, and the local Han and Hui farmers, who would be willing to stay in Wushaoling for a long time? Today, the land in Wushaoling is frozen just as thick as before, and sometimes you still have to wear cotton clothes in June, but there are those who are not afraid of the cold, including his son, who brave the howling north wind and engage in the great work of moving mountains and opening roads. After so many years, the reflection of this old man's mood when he came to Gansu twice is: "Times are different after all."

    When a son leaves home, the parents always miss him. After Du Zhishan joined the railway, he inevitably caused his longing. He looked forward to his son sending letters back, and he often received letters from his son. But whenever he received Zhishan's letters, he looked at the postmark, and the address of the place where the letter was sent was always getting farther and farther. The first year his son left home, he sent a letter from the Baotian Line; the second year, the letters were stamped with the postmarks of some towns on the Tianlan Road; today, he personally came to Wushaoling, more than two hundred kilometers west of Lanzhou, to see his son. His son is far from home, but this did not make the old man unhappy. Because he came to Wushaoling and saw his son's future. This future is not the apprentice in the privately-run silver shop who was despised in the past, but the bulldozer operator in the new China who is respected. He will see his son and his companions, standing tall in the driver's seat, driving bulldozers, crossing Wushaoling, passing through the Hexi Corridor, passing through grasslands, deserts and vast Gobi deserts, directly to the rich oil city of the motherland—Yumen, directly to the border of Northwest China. At that time, the postmark stamped on his son's letter will be Wuwei, will be Hami, will be Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. At that time, he will take the train to visit his son, he will see the snow of the Qilian Mountains, he will see the ancient Jiayuguan, and he will also taste the fragrant and sweet Hami melon. At that time, sitting in the carriage, recalling his first visit to Lanzhou, he will have a new feeling. At that time, when historians write the history of the development of Northwest China, railway workers will occupy an important page, and on this page, there will be his son's name.

    父亲和儿子
    本报记者　沈　石
    我第一次见到他，是在从兰州开往打柴沟（兰新铁路的一段）的火车里。
    他和一位年轻的妇女，坐在我的对面。他们穿得很整洁。那女人的头上，围着一块干净的毛巾，黑色皮大衣里面裹着浅蓝色的棉袄。行李架上摆着他们的笨重的行李。我猜想，这两位旅客可能是到远地方去的。
    那是深夜四点多钟了，旅客们都靠在座位上打盹；他，揩去了冻结在车窗上的冰层，不断地向窗外远望，直等到火车通过了黄河便桥，才回过头来。
    “老大爷！你从那儿来？”我向他招呼。
      “洛阳。”
      “到那里去？”我问：
      “到乌鞘岭去。”
      “上乌鞘岭工地吗？”
      “是的，我儿子在那里开推土机，我去看看他。”
      “她呢？”我指着那年轻的妇女说。
      “同志！这你不用问便猜得出来了。”老人话没说完，那女人的脸就跟着发红了。
    以后，我在土石方工程队经常看到他。他住在推土机驾驶员的宿舍里。那位年青的妇女，已经和她的丈夫安起家了。
    在乌鞘岭的山腰里，搭着一排一排的工人宿舍。这些临时宿舍很像陕北的窑洞，屋顶上涂着很厚的泥土，在零下三十度左右的冬天住在里面，比起单薄的帐篷来要暖得多了。
    有一次，驾驶员们在宿舍里学习国家过渡时期的总路线。我见到他，盘着腿，坐在床上，仔细地听大家的发言。学习结束，我走到他跟前，他没等我开口，就把他的儿子——杜志善叫来，介绍我和他认识。我们谈过一阵后，这位老人便滔滔不绝地向我叙述他这趟不同寻常的旅行。
    他高兴地拉着我的手说：“当我坐上火车，从宝鸡到兰州，见到隧道一个接着一个，见到那旁的渭河、从山侧开辟出来的路基，就想：这里面，有我儿子的一分力量。昨天，我站在大沙沟的山头，亲自看到他在大雪中开推土机，我心里有说不出的快乐。我为他感到骄傲，感到安慰。”
    他到乌鞘岭的第二天，踏着冰冻的山路，去参观那附近的隧道工程。他见到成千的工人，日夜不停地开凿隧道。他到过龙沟堡，见到那高耸的桥墩，兀立在龙沟河上，工人们系着安全带，在紧张地进行高空作业。他为隧道工人和桥梁工人克服种种困难的精神所鼓舞。
    一个风雪交加的夜里，他到了大沙沟的工地。那里，电灯、探照灯照得整个工地像白昼一样。推土机、除根机、铲运机发出轧轧的声响。年轻的推土机驾驶员，冒着乱纷纷的雪花，将两座山头的泥土推到深沟里。他们要把深沟填起一道高达四十五公尺的路基，未来的火车，将从这上面通过。他第一次见到这样浩大的工程，第一次见到自己的儿子开着推土机，和同伴在深沟里填平从山上倾泻下来的泥土。
    见了自己的儿子和那些推土机手们，怎叫这位老年人不喜悦呢！他刚来时，推土机手们听说杜志善的父亲来了，一个传一个，围拢过来，问长问短，腾出床位给他睡，将他当作自己的亲人一样看待。他们像生龙活虎一样，干起活来，不知从那儿来的一股劲。不管是在天兰路上的无水区和苦水区，或者是天气酷寒的乌鞘岭，他们从来没有向困难低过头。乌鞘岭冬季施工中，土地的冻层达一公尺以上，冻土有时摌破了推土机的刀片，他们将刀片卸下，挂上除根机，先把冻土扒松，再用推土机推送。他们就是这样用自己的智慧和毅力向大自然作顽强的斗争的。
    三年前，杜志善还是银饰店的学徒。自从参加了修建铁路的工作，经过党和老师傅的培养，学会了驾驶推土机。这个青年人在人民的铁道队伍里逐渐成长起来了。每当杜志善满脸泥尘回到宿舍的时候，老人望望他，慢吞吞地说，“孩子！好好地干吧！”
    儿子一天一天的成长，自然引起老年人的高兴。但是，当他想到自己，有辛酸，也有快慰。他经营过小生意，小生意并没有使他走向富裕。到了后来，不得不把自己的儿子送到银饰店去当学徒，他本人也不得不回到洛阳的浅井头村去种地。附近的农民听到他回来了，对他说：“杜子敬！还是干咱们这一行吧！比做生意到底靠得住些哩！”就是这样，他守着十多亩土地，来勉强维持全家七口人的生活。解放后，他参加了互助组，家境也慢慢好起来了。现在他又学了国家在过渡时期的总路线，知道了自己将来所走的道路。这次来到乌鞘岭，看到了推土机、铲运机……，看到了铁路工人的生产劲头，他的眼界更是开阔了。
    他把话题又回到这次旅行上来，他用过去出门的艰难来说明这次“不平常的旅行”。
    那是很久以前的事。他曾经到过兰州，那时没有火车，从西安动身，足足走了二十五天，路上还碰到过土匪。这次，只两天多，就从西安到了乌鞘岭。当他初次在兰州逗留的时候，曾经听人说过：“一到乌鞘岭，全身都发冷。”那时候，除了草原上的藏族牧民，除了当地的汉族、回族农民，谁愿意长时期留在乌鞘岭呢？到了今天，乌鞘岭的地，冻得和从前一样的厚，六月里有时仍然要穿棉衣，但是，就有那些不怕冻的人，其中也有他的儿子，迎着呼啸的北风，在那里从事移山开路的伟大工作。相隔多少年，前后两次来到甘肃，这位老年人心情上所反射出来的是：“时代毕竟不同了。”
    儿子离开了家，做父母的总是要想望。杜志善上铁路后，不免引起他的怀念。他盼望儿子寄信回来，他也经常收到儿子的回信。可是每当他接到志善的信件，看看邮戳，发信的地址总是越来越远了。儿子离家的第一年，从宝天线上寄回了信；第二年，信件上盖的是天兰路上一些城镇的邮戳；今天，他亲自来兰州以西二百多公里的乌鞘岭，才看到了自己的儿子。儿子离家乡远了，但这并没有引起老人的不快乐。因为他来乌鞘岭，看出了儿子的前程。这个前程，并不是私营银饰店过去受人贱视的学徒，而是新中国受人尊敬的推土机手。他将看到自己的儿子和他的同伴，雄赳赳地坐在驾驶室里，开着推土机，越过乌鞘岭，穿过河西走廊，通过草滩、沙漠和大戈壁，直达祖国丰富的石油城——玉门，直达大西北的边疆。那时候，加盖在儿子信件上的邮戳，将是武威，将是哈密，将是新疆的省会——乌鲁木齐。那时候，他坐上火车，去看望儿子，将看到祁连山的积雪，将看到古老的嘉峪关，也将尝到又香又甜的哈密瓜。那时候，他坐在车厢里，回想起他第一次到兰州的往事来，将更有一番新的心情。那时候，历史家写大西北的开发史，铁路职工们，将占着重要的一页，而这一页里，就有他儿子的名字。
