Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th:

Comrades!

    Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, and through you to all voters in the Leningrad electoral district, for granting me the great honor and trust of nominating me as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (sustained applause).

    I assure you that I will continue to faithfully and selflessly dedicate myself to the cause of our glorious Communist Party and our great people, and devote all my energy to the socialist motherland (sustained applause).

    In our democratic country, the election of the highest organs of state power is an extremely important matter. As the Soviet people, masters of their own country, prepare for the upcoming elections, they also look back on the path they have traversed in the four years since the last elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    The Soviet economy is confidently advancing along a path of continuous growth.

    During the period of 1949-1953, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 62 percent, and the national income in 1953 was more than double the pre-war level. In recent years, our industry has developed by leaps and bounds. We have built 2,500 industrial enterprises, the basic capital of industry has increased by more than one-half, and industrial output has increased by 1.8 times. To illustrate these achievements, it suffices to point out that the increase in industrial output in recent years has greatly exceeded the total industrial output in 1940 (applause). For many years, our Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, has firmly and consistently pursued the policy of national industrialization. The results of this policy are well known. Our country currently possesses a powerful heavy industry, and we will continue to develop heavy industry as the foundation for ensuring the continuous growth and development of the entire national economy, and as a reliable bulwark of Soviet defense (applause).

    And now, thanks to the achievements made in industrialization, our Party has set the task of greatly increasing the production of consumer goods in two or three years.

    In the light industry sector, we can currently only speak of some preliminary achievements. For example, due to the adoption of some measures, the output value of consumer goods in the second half of 1953 increased by more than 30 billion rubles compared to the first half of the year. This year, we will reach the level of consumer goods production stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan for 1955. This means that in the field of consumer goods production, the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be completed in four years (stormy applause).

    It is quite obvious that the further rapid development of agriculture is of paramount importance for increasing the production of consumer goods. As everyone knows, the Party and the government have formulated and are implementing a comprehensive plan to eliminate the state of neglect and backwardness in many important sectors of agriculture. The Party and the government have adopted measures to ensure the further development of animal husbandry, to further increase the production of potatoes and vegetables, to further expand grain production, and to reclaim virgin and abandoned land. Significant measures have been implemented to materially encourage collective farms and collective farmers to increase agricultural production.

    Rapidly improving agriculture, producing sufficient, and then abundant, food for the people domestically, and producing sufficient, and then abundant, raw materials for light industry, is the cause of the entire nation. All our Party, Soviet, trade union and youth league organizations, our industry and transportation, and all enterprises and scientific institutions should constantly and conscientiously concern themselves with the increasing prosperity of all sectors of agriculture, and help collective farms, machine tractor stations and state farms increase agricultural production. There is no doubt that, with the universal attention and concern of the entire nation, our collective farms and state farms, our collective farmers, and the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms, will gloriously fulfill their responsibilities to the country (applause).

    On the basis of the development of the entire national economy and the increase in national income, the material and cultural standards of the people have been greatly improved. In the past four years, the real wages of workers and staff, and the income of collective farmers have increased. Due to the reduction of state retail prices, the wages of workers and staff, and the income of collective farmers have increased by a total of 60 percent in four years.

    The improvement of the welfare of our people requires the further development of Soviet trade. This year, state-owned and cooperative trade organizations, just as in the production of consumer goods, will sell more than double the amount of goods to residents compared to 1940. In the field of trade, the Fifth Five-Year Plan will be completed in four years (stormy applause).

    Allocations for building schools, hospitals and children's welfare institutions are constantly increasing. In recent years, large-scale housing construction has been carried out, but the need for housing remains great. We will intensify the construction of hospitals and schools, and strive to expand housing construction.

    The Soviet people have reason to be proud of the achievements they have already made, and are confident that our country will achieve new and even more powerful economic growth (applause).

    However, we must admit that in our practical work, there are still many shortcomings that hinder progress, and sometimes there are backward and neglected areas. These shortcomings can only be eliminated by ourselves, by the leaders, and by the Soviet people. We have exposed and will continue to expose these shortcomings, even though our self-criticism is often grist for the mill of those with malicious intentions and enemies abroad. We will resolutely fight to eliminate as quickly as possible the backwardness and neglect in all sectors of our socialist construction—wherever such phenomena are found.

    The current task is: to eliminate shortcomings and backwardness and neglect, while ensuring the continuous growth and improvement of socialist production, because this is the foundation for strengthening the power of our motherland, raising the living standards of the people, and developing our science and culture.

    All of us Soviet men and women, all our people, must clearly understand that the main and decisive condition for the further upsurge and comprehensive development of the national economy is to strive to increase labor productivity in all sectors—industry, transportation and agriculture. We should all know that without a large and continuous increase in labor productivity, the welfare of the Soviet people cannot be greatly and rapidly improved.

    The great Lenin, the founder of our Party and state, gave fundamental instructions at the very beginning of the establishment of Soviet power: raising labor productivity is the fundamental task of the new society, and it is impossible to transition to communism without solving this task.

    As everyone knows, the industrialization of our country and the transformation of the national economy have greatly increased labor productivity. If we take a long period, such as the last 25 years, as an example, in industry, labor productivity has increased by about six times; in construction and railway transportation, labor productivity has increased by three and a half times. Labor productivity in collective farms and state farms has increased by about three times compared to the labor productivity of agriculture before the revolution.

    Naturally, if we compare it with the labor productivity of the past, this is a significant achievement. But if we do not look at the past, but look to the future, hoping to solve the task of maximally satisfying the growing material needs of our people, and solving the task of conducting and winning economic competition with advanced capitalist countries, the situation is different. If we look at the problem in this way, it must be admitted that the current level of labor productivity is not high enough.

    We have a responsibility to greatly increase social labor productivity. Our national economic sectors have powerful technical equipment, and we must strive to improve and develop this equipment; we must mechanize laborious operations on a larger scale, and strive to develop the electrification of the national economy, including agricultural electrification. This is the way to increase labor productivity and reduce the labor of workers and collective farmers. Our national economy has skilled cadres who have mastered complex technologies, and we must continue to tirelessly care for the improvement of the cultural and technical level of these cadres, train new cadres, and continuously improve the discipline and consciousness of the working people in all sectors of our construction work.

    Further improving the organization of production and the organization of labor is of decisive significance for rapidly increasing labor productivity at present. We have very serious shortcomings in this regard. With the increasing strengthening of our material and technical foundation, and the increasing development of our productive forces, the issue of labor organization, that is, the planned and most rational use of social labor in enterprises and throughout the country, has become increasingly important.

    Our urgent task is: to make concern for greatly increasing labor productivity truly the center of all practical leadership work in further developing the national economy. We must launch a truly broad national movement to strive to greatly increase labor productivity, and strive to bring the labor productivity of every industrial enterprise, every construction site, every transportation department, every collective farm, state farm, and machine tractor station, that is, every front line of our great socialist construction, to a high level (sustained applause).

    The quality of industrial products is of very great significance to the national economy. The quality of products in many of our factories is still very low, and this phenomenon can no longer be tolerated. This shameful phenomenon of producing substandard products must be eliminated as quickly as possible. Industrial departments must produce durable, beautifully designed goods for our people. We must ensure that the "Made in the USSR" trademark becomes a full guarantee of excellent product quality in the international market (applause).

    Soviet science should play a major role in ensuring the continuous progress of our motherland. The Soviet people are proud of their scientists, and hope that scientific workers and technicians will achieve success in future, bolder creative work and in new scientific discoveries (stormy, sustained applause).

    Comrades! Life has placed new and higher demands on all our state organs. However, in the work of state organs, there is still bureaucratic work style, and our Party is waging a resolute struggle against this work style. Soviet state organs must continuously improve their working methods on the basis of frequent contact with the working people, must pay attention to their demands, care about their difficulties, strictly abide by Soviet laws, and prevent abuse of power against Soviet citizens (sustained applause).

    The Soviet Union is moving towards a new upsurge. The rock-solid foundation of the Soviet system—the worker-peasant alliance—is consolidated and unshakable. The friendship of all nationalities, based on complete equality, mutual respect and fraternal cooperation, is firm and unbreakable. This is the source of the strength of our socialist country (stormy, sustained applause).

    Comrades! In foreign policy, our consistent policy is to ensure peaceful conditions for our country's communist construction, and to defend the cause of peace from encroachment by aggressive blocs. This policy is in line with both the fundamental and vital interests of the Soviet people and of all mankind (sustained applause).

    Needless to say, as long as aggressive blocs that still dream of destroying our socialist country exist in the world, the Soviet Union must maintain its armed forces so that they can be ready at any time to crush the possible adventurous actions of aggressors (stormy applause).

    The most important result of recent years is that millions of men and women have taken the cause of defending peace and the security of all nations into their own hands. The mark of our time is that men and women of different social groups and different political and religious views are uniting in defense of peace and national security.

    Take Europe, for example. Recently, aggressive blocs have been pursuing more and more blatantly a policy of splitting national forces within European countries, and a policy of dividing Europe, inciting some European countries against others. However, this policy is being resisted by the united resistance of the people of European countries, who are uniting more and more closely in the struggle against divisive policies that lead to destruction, and in the struggle to defend peace and progress. French patriots are rising more and more resolutely to defend their motherland from the increasing threat of the revival of German militarism—the mortal enemy of the great French nation. In Italy and other European countries, the people are increasingly determined to defend peace and protect their countries from the danger of being dragged into a new world war by others through the military group of German revanchists.

    The people of Asian countries today live in an environment of vigorous development of peaceful forces, and they are fully determined to transform Asia from a long-term source of war into a reliable bastion of international peace. The People's Republic of China embodies this determination first and foremost (stormy applause). The Soviet people are very excited that the glorious People's Republic of China stands with the Soviet Union at the forefront of the struggle for peace and international security (applause).

    The great people of India are making valuable contributions to consolidating peace. It is gratifying that Indian politicians are vigilant against the increasingly blatant conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc to covet Asia. In response to the statement by American diplomats that the United States intends to rule Asia indefinitely, the Indian Prime Minister recently replied: "Asian countries do not accept—and India undoubtedly does not accept—this policy, and do not intend to be ruled by any country for any purpose."

    These words reflect a profound truth: it is not the 19th century now, but the second half of the 20th century; the people of Asian countries have embarked on the road of national freedom and progress, and it is not for anyone to drag them back (sustained applause).

    It is generally acknowledged that in 1953, there was some easing of international tensions. Peace-loving humanity contributed to the cessation of the Korean War.

    Every thoughtful person cannot but consider now what to do next, and how to seek a realistic basis for reliably consolidating peace and international security. Some people believe that mankind can only choose between two possibilities: either a new world war or the so-called Cold War; this is not true. The people of all countries are vitally concerned about reliably consolidating peace. The Soviet government advocates further easing international tensions, advocates establishing a solid and lasting peace, and firmly opposes the Cold War policy, because this policy is a policy of preparing for a new world war, and in the context of the use of modern means of warfare, a new world war would mean the destruction of world civilization.

    As everyone knows, the enemies of peace, in order to wage the Cold War, do not hesitate to spread all kinds of slanders against the Soviet Union and its foreign policy, and place their main bet on their fabricated myth of the so-called Soviet Union's aggressive intentions. However, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has thoroughly exposed this absurd myth, and as an old Russian proverb says: "A false word does not last long, a lie does not live long." (applause)

    Our position is clear. We advocate that the Soviet Union engage in peaceful economic competition with all capitalist countries, including, of course, the United States.

    The Soviet government has always consistently adhered to the position that any dispute in current international relations, no matter how difficult it may be, should be resolved by peaceful means (applause). The Soviet government is in favor of holding international conferences so that representatives of all countries can work sincerely to ease international tensions and seek ways to peacefully resolve disputes, exercising equal rights. Based on this policy, the Soviet Union actively participated in the Four-Power Berlin Conference, as you all know, and put forward proposals for effectively resolving a number of important international issues. We attach importance to the upcoming great power conference in Geneva with the participation of other relevant countries, at which the People's Republic of China will be an equal participant (stormy applause).

    It cannot but be recognized that the main obstacle to further easing international tensions is that Western countries treat the resolution of major international issues as an exclusive military bloc that puts aggressive military strategic considerations above everything else.

    The attitude of Western countries towards the proposal to conclude an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe can only be explained by the above reasons. As everyone knows, what the Western countries have countered this treaty with is the establishment of a six-nation military group, in which West German militarists will be the main force and play the main role.

    Some people are trying hard to convince us that it seems that once "Little Europe" is established, Germany will gain its position in Europe and become a peaceful country. This is complete nonsense. Is it not obvious that, due to the establishment of the "European Defense Community," German militarism will gain in the West what it could not gain by war?

    The Soviet Union firmly opposes the establishment of an aggressive Greater Germany under the guise of "Little Europe" (applause).

    There is no doubt that as long as everyone truly hopes to guarantee European security, it is possible to overcome the obstacles to concluding an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe, and to carefully study the proposals put forward for this purpose.

    The Soviet government advocates expanding economic and trade ties with foreign countries on the basis of mutual benefit. We are satisfied that London has begun to recognize the importance of developing economic ties with the Soviet Union (applause).

    Every Soviet person feels naturally proud that the great friendship that links our motherland and the people's democratic countries is becoming stronger and stronger. This fraternal friendship is not only a source of strength for the democratic camp, but also the most important bastion of international peace (stormy applause).

    Comrades! For more than half a century, the Communist Party created by the genius Lenin has been fighting tirelessly for a better life and happiness for the people. Our Party is inextricably linked with the Soviet people. The people trust their own beloved Party and are uniting more and more closely around it (stormy, sustained applause).

    Our Party has openly expressed its views on such an important issue as the principle of collective leadership, and it believes that its opinions have been endorsed by the Soviet people (stormy, sustained applause). Undeniably, the principle of collective leadership of the Party and the state is the necessary guarantee for correctly and successfully completing the urgent tasks facing us, and for correctly and successfully solving the fundamental issues concerning the fate of the Soviet people.

    The trust and support of the people enable our Party to bravely and resolutely expose the mistakes and shortcomings in the work of the central and local Party organizations, Soviet and economic organs. Our Party has always shared weal and woe with the people (stormy applause).

    Thirty-six years is a very short period for a new social system. Our Party and people have done a lot of work to consolidate and develop this system. The Soviet people have ample reason to be proud of the achievements and victories of the new system, especially if we consider that foreign aggressive forces have launched several disastrous wars against us, causing various other obstacles, which have hindered and are still hindering the full realization of the great potential of socialist construction.

    Under the leadership of its beloved Communist Party, the Soviet people have built a new society where there is no exploitation of man by man, no political and national oppression. On this basis, our country has established new relations between people, fraternal and friendly cooperative relations between workers, peasants and intellectuals, and all the Soviet people (applause).

    All the working people of our country have the same goal and the same task—to ensure the further prosperity and strength of our motherland, to rapidly improve the material and cultural standards of the people, and to work tirelessly to make the lives of all Soviet people better day by day (stormy, sustained applause).

    All sincere labor that is engaged in to achieve this great and noble goal is valued and respected in our country. Men and women workers, engineers and technicians, and other staff in the industrial, construction, transportation, postal and telecommunications sectors; men and women collective farmers; all agricultural workers; trade workers—all laborers who are creating and expanding wealth for our country; scientific workers who are committed to technological progress, to creating new possibilities for conquering the forces of nature and reducing human labor; education, literature and art workers who are dedicated to the noble cause of conducting communist education for the Soviet people; selfless medical workers who guarantee the health of the Soviet people; heroic Soviet soldiers of the army and navy who have many victories and glories—all the Soviet people are creators and builders of a new life. Because of their selfless labor, our country has the greatness and glory it has today (stormy applause).

    The Soviet people look forward to their tomorrow with confidence, joy and courage. They know that the Communist Party has dedicated all its strength to their happiness, and to the peaceful development and prosperity of our glorious motherland (sustained applause).

    Long live our great and heroic people! (stormy applause)

    Long live our own Communist Party—the inspirer and organizer of all our victories! (stormy, sustained applause) May our motherland become more and more prosperous for the happiness and joy of all Soviet people! (stormy, sustained applause)

    Forward to new victories under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin! (stormy, sustained cheers. All stand.)

专栏：

    在莫斯科列宁格勒选区的选民大会上
    格·马·马林科夫同志的演说同志们！
    请让我向你们、并通过你们向列宁格勒选区的全体选民表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们给我很大的荣誉和信任，提名我为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人（经久不息的掌声）。
    我向你们保证：我将继续忠实地、忘我地献身于我们光荣的共产党、我们伟大的人民的事业，把我的全部精力献给社会主义的祖国（经久不息的掌声）。
    在我们的民主国家中，选举最高政权机关是一件极端重要的事情。当了自己国家的主人的苏联人民一方面筹备即将举行的选举，同时也要回顾他们在上届苏联最高苏维埃选举后的四年中所走过的道路。
    苏维埃经济正满怀信心地沿着不断高涨的道路前进。
    在一九四九—一九五三年期间，苏联的国民收入增加了百分之六十二，一九五三年的国民收入为战前水平的二倍多。这几年来，我们的工业有了飞跃的发展。我们建设了二千五百个工业企业，工业的基本资金增加了二分之一以上，工业的产量已增加为一点八倍。为了要说明这些成就，我指出一点就够了：这几年来增加的工业产量大大超过了一九四○年的工业总产量（掌声）。许多年来，我们的党在列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林同志的领导下，坚定地、始终不渝地执行国家工业化的政策。这个政策获得的结果是人所共知的。我国目前拥有强大的重工业，我们今后还要不断地发展重工业，把它当作保证整个国民经济不断增长和发展的基础，当作苏联国防的可靠堡垒（掌声）。
    而现在，由于工业化所取得的成果，我们的党确定了在两三年内大大增加日用品产量的任务。
    在轻工业方面，目前我们只能说有了一些初步的成绩。例如，由于采取了一些措施，一九五三年下半年的日用品产值就比上半年增加了三百多亿卢布。今年我们将达到第五个五年计划规定的一九五五年的日用品生产水平。这就是说，在日用品生产方面，第五个五年计划将在四年内完成（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    十分明显，农业的进一步的迅速发展，对于增加日用品的生产具有极其重要的意义。大家知道，党和政府制订了而且正在执行着关于消除农业许多重要部门的无人照管现象和落后现象的措施的全面计划。党和政府采取了保证进一步发展饲畜业、进一步增加马铃薯和蔬菜产量，进一步扩大谷物生产以及开垦处女地和荒废的土地的措施，实行了重大的措施来从物质上鼓励集体农庄和集体农民增加农产品产量。
    迅速提高农业，在国内为人民生产足够的、然后是丰富的各种食品和为轻工业生产足够的、然后是丰富的各种原料，这是全国人民的事业。我们所有的党、苏维埃、工会和青年团组织，我们的工业和运输业，以及所有的企业和科学机关，都应当经常地、认真地关心使农业各部门日益繁荣，帮助集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场增加农业生产。毫无疑问，在全国普遍的重视和关心下，我们的集体农庄和国营农场，我们的集体农民，机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，一定会光荣地完成他们对国家的责任（掌声）。
    在整个国民经济发展和国民收入增加的基础上，人民的物质和文化水平大大提高了。在过去四年中，工人和职员的实际工资和集体农民的收入都提高了。由于国家零售价格的减低，工人、职员的工资和集体农民的收入四年中一共增加了百分之六十。
    我国人民福利的增进要求进一步发展苏维埃贸易。今年，国营和合作社贸易机关正如在日用品生产方面一样，售给居民的商品，将增加为一九四○年的二倍多。在贸易方面，第五个五年计划将在四年内完成（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    建筑学校、医院和儿童福利机关的拨款不断增加。近几年来，大规模地展开了住宅建筑，但住宅的需要仍然很大。我们将加紧建设医院、学校，尽力扩大住宅建筑。
  苏联人民对于他们已经取得的成就有理由引以为骄傲，并坚信我们国家将获得新的、更加强大的经济高涨（掌声）。
    但是，我们必须承认，在我们的实际工作中，仍然存在着许多阻碍进步的缺点，有时还有落后的和无人照管的地方。要消灭这些缺点只有靠我们自己，靠领导者，靠苏维埃人。我们已经揭发了并将继续揭发这些缺点，尽管我们的自我批评时常是国外那些心怀恶意的人们和敌人幸灾乐祸的材料。我们将坚决地为尽速消灭我们社会主义建设的各部门中的落后和无人照管的现象——无论在什么地方发现了这种现象——而斗争。
    现在的任务是：消灭缺点和落后及无人照管的现象，同时保证社会主义生产不断增长、不断完善，因为这是加强我们祖国的力量、提高人民的生活水平和发展我国的科学与文化的基础。
    我们全体苏维埃男女，我们全体人民必须清楚地了解到：国民经济进一步高涨和全面发展的主要的和决定性的条件，就是尽力提高所有部门——工业、运输业和农业部门——的劳动生产率。我们大家应该知道，没有劳动生产率的大大的和不断的提高，苏联人民的福利就不可能大大地迅速地增进。
    我们的党和国家的缔造者伟大的列宁早在苏维埃政权建立之初就作了带根本性的训示：提高劳动生产率是新社会的根本任务，不解决这个任务就不可能过渡到共产主义。
    大家知道，我国的工业化和国民经济的改造，使得劳动生产率大大地提高了。如果拿一段长的时期，譬如说最近二十五年来作例子，在工业中，劳动生产率约提高为六倍，在建筑业和铁路运输业中，劳动生产率提高为三倍半。集体农庄和国营农场的劳动生产率约提高为革命前农业劳动生产率的三倍。
    自然，如果拿过去的劳动生产率来比较的话，这是重大的成就。但是，如果我们不看过去，而是展望将来，希望解决最大限度地满足我国人民日益增长的物质需要的任务，解决和先进的资本主义国家进行经济竞赛并取得胜利的任务的话，情况就不同了。如果我们这样来看问题，那就必须承认，目前的劳动生产率水平是不够高的。
    我们有责任使社会劳动生产率大大提高。我们的国民经济各部门有着强大的技术设备，我们必须尽力改善和发展这些设备；我们必须在更大的规模上使费力操作机械化，尽力发展国民经济的电气化，包括农业电气化在内。这就是提高劳动生产率和减轻工人和集体农民劳动的方法。我们的国民经济有着已经掌握了复杂技术的熟练干部，我们必须继续孜孜不倦地关怀这些干部的文化、技术水平的提高，培养新的干部，不断提高我们建设工作各部门的劳动人民的纪律性和自觉性。
    进一步改善生产组织和劳动组织对于迅速提高劳动生产率在现在具有决定性的意义。在这方面我们存在着非常严重的缺点。随着我国的物质技术基础的日益加强，和我国的生产力的日益发展，劳动组织的问题，即有计划地和最合理地在企业中和在全国范围内利用社会劳动力的问题，也就具有日益重大的意义。
    我们的迫切任务是：要使对大力提高劳动生产率的关怀真正成为进一步发展国民经济的一切实际领导工作的中心。必须展开一个真正广泛的全民运动，以争取大大提高劳动生产率，争取将每一个工业企业、每一个建筑工地、每一个运输部门、每一个集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站，即我们伟大的社会主义建设的各个战线上的劳动生产率提到高度的水平（经久不息的掌声）。
    工业产品的质量问题对国民经济具有非常重大的意义。我们有许多工厂的产品的质量仍然很低，再也不能容忍这种现象了。必须尽速消灭这种生产劣等产品的可耻现象。工业部门必须为我们人民生产坚固耐用、式样美观的物品。我们必须做到使“苏联制”商标在国际市场上成为充分保证货物质量优良的包票（掌声）。
    苏维埃科学应该在保证我们祖国不断进步方面起重大的作用。苏联人民以自己的科学家为骄傲，希望科学工作者和技术人员在今后的更大胆的创造性工作中，在新的科学发现的工作中取得成就（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    同志们！生活向我们所有的国家机关提出了新的更高的要求。然而，在国家机关的工作中，至今仍然存在着官僚主义作风，我们党正在和这种作风进行坚决的斗争。苏维埃国家机关必须在和劳动人民经常联系的基础上，精益求精地改进自己的工作方法，必须注意他们的要求，关心他们的困难，严格遵守苏维埃法律，防止对苏维埃公民滥用职权（经久不息的掌声）。
    苏联正在走向新的高涨。苏维埃制度的坚如磐石的基础——工农联盟是巩固的和不可动摇的。建立在完全平等、互相尊重和兄弟般合作的基础上的各族人民的友谊，是稳固的和牢不可破的。这是我们社会主义国家力量的泉源（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    同志们！在外交政策方面，我们的方针始终是为我国的共产主义建设保证和平条件，保卫和平事业不受侵略集团的侵犯。这个方针是既符合苏联人民、又符合全人类的根本切身利益的（经久不息的掌声）。
    不用说，只要那些仍然妄想摧毁我们社会主义国家的侵略集团在世界上存在一天，苏联就必须保持自己的武装部队，使他们能够随时粉碎侵略者的可能的冒险行动（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    近几年来的最重要的结果是：千百万男女已经在把保卫和平和各国人民的安全的事业掌握在自己的手中。我们这个时代的标志是：社会集团不同、政治和宗教观点不同的男女，正团结起来保卫和平和国家安全。
    拿欧洲来说吧。近来，侵略集团愈来愈露骨地奉行在欧洲各国内部分裂民族力量的政策，奉行分裂欧洲、唆使欧洲一部分国家反对另一部分国家的政策。但是，这种政策正遭到欧洲各国人民团结一致的反抗，欧洲人民在反对招致毁灭的分裂政策的斗争中、在保卫和平和进步的斗争中，团结得愈来愈紧密了。法国爱国者正在日益坚决地起来保卫他们的祖国免受德国军国主义——伟大的法兰西民族的死敌——复活的日益迫近的威胁。在意大利和欧洲其他国家中，人民日益坚决地致力于保卫和平，保护自己的国家，以避免别人借助于德国复仇主义军事集团把它拖入新世界大战的危险。
    亚洲各国人民今天生活在和平力量蓬勃发展的环境中，他们有充分的决心把亚洲从长期的战争策源地变为可靠的国际和平堡垒。中华人民共和国首先体现了这种决心（暴风雨般的掌声）。光荣的中华人民共和国跟苏联一起站在为和平和国际安全而斗争的最前列，苏联人民感到非常兴奋（掌声）。
    伟大的印度人民正为巩固和平作出有价值的贡献。印度的政治家们对美国侵略集团觊觎亚洲的日益露骨的阴谋，保持着警惕，这是不能不受到欢迎的。美国外交家们声称美国打算无限期地统治亚洲，印度总理最近针对这种言论回答说：“亚洲国家并不接受——印度毫无疑问不接受——这个政策，并且也不打算为任何目的受任何国家的统治。”
    这些话反映了意义深刻的真理：现在不是十九世纪，而是二十世纪的下半叶；亚洲各国人民走上民族自由和进步的道路，并不是为了让什么人再把它们拖转去（经久不息的掌声）。
    大家都承认，在一九五三年，国际紧张局势有了某些缓和。爱好和平的人类促成了朝鲜战争的停止。
    每一个有思想的人现在都不能不考虑下一步如何做，如何为可靠地巩固和平和国际安全寻求现实的基础。有人认为，人类只能在两个可能性中间作抉择：要末就是新世界大战，要末就是所谓冷战；这是不真实的。各国人民都切身地关心可靠地巩固和平。苏联政府主张进一步缓和国际紧张局势，主张建立牢固的持久和平，坚决反对冷战政策，因为这个政策是准备新世界大战的政策，而在使用现代战争手段的情况下，新世界大战就意味着世界文明的毁灭。
    大家知道，和平的敌人为了进行冷战，不惜对苏联和它的外交政策散布种种谰言，把他们的主要赌注下在他们捏造的所谓苏联有侵略意图的神话上。但是，苏联的和平外交政策彻底地戳穿了这个荒谬的神话，俄国有句老谚语说得好：“假话过不久，谎言活不长。”（掌声）
    我们的立场是明确的。我们主张苏联跟所有资本主义国家，当然包括美国在内，展开和平的经济竞赛。
    苏联政府始终一贯坚守的立场是：当前国际关系方面的任何争端，不管它是多么困难，都应当以和平方法解决（鼓掌）。苏联政府赞成举行国际会议，以便各国代表运用平等的权利，为缓和国际紧张局势而诚恳地工作，寻求和平解决争端的途径。苏联依据这个方针，积极参加了四国柏林会议，正如你们大家所知道的，并且提出了有效地解决若干重要国际问题的建议。我们重视即将在日内瓦召开的有其他有关国家参加的大国会议，在这个会议上中华人民共和国将是平等的参加者（暴风雨般的鼓掌声）。
    不能不认为，进一步缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍是：西方国家作为一个把侵略性的军事战略考虑置于一切之上的排他性的军事集团，来对待重大国际问题的解决。
    西方国家之所以对缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议采取那种态度，只能用上述理由来解释。大家知道，西方国家拿来与这个条约对抗的，是建立六国军事集团，在这个集团中西德军国主义者将是主要的力量并起主要的作用。
    有人竭力要使我们相信：似乎“小欧洲”一成立，德国就将在欧洲取得它的地位而成为和平的国家。这完全是胡说。由于“欧洲防务集团”的建立，德国军国主义将会在西方夺得它用战争所取不到的东西，这难道不是明显的吗？
    苏联坚决反对在“小欧洲”的幌子下建立侵略性的大德国（鼓掌）。
      毫无疑问，只要大家真正希望保障欧洲安全，那么就有可能克服缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的障碍，并仔细地研究为此而提出的建议。
      苏联政府主张在互利的基础上与外国扩大经济联系和贸易联系。我们满意的是：伦敦已开始承认和苏联发展经济联系的重要性（鼓掌）。
      把我们祖国和各人民民主国家联结在一起的那种伟大友谊正越来越加强，这使每一个苏联人都感到自然而然的骄傲。这种兄弟般的友谊不仅是民主阵营取得力量的泉源，而且是国际和平最重要的堡垒（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    同志们！半个多世纪以来，天才的列宁所缔造的共产党一直在为人民的更美好的生活和幸福而不懈地斗争。我们党和苏联人民不可分地联系在一起。人民相信他们自己亲爱的党，并且日益紧密地团结在它的周围（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    我们的党已经公开表示了对集体领导原则这样一个重要问题的看法，它相信，它的意见得到了苏联人民的拥护（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。无可置辩地，集体领导党和国家的原则，是正确地、胜利地完成我们面前的切身重要的任务，和正确地、胜利地解决关乎苏联人民命运的根本问题的必要保证。
    人民的信任和支持使我们的党能够勇敢、坚决地揭露中央和地方的党组织、苏维埃和经济机关工作中的错误和缺点。我们党一向和人民同甘苦共患难（暴风雨般的掌声）。
  三十六年，这对于一种新的社会制度是一个很短的时期。我们的党和人民做了许多工作来巩固和发展这种制度。苏联人民有充分的理由以新制度的成就和胜利而自豪，如果我们考虑到，外国侵略势力几次向我们发动灾难性的战争，造成其他种种障碍，曾经阻挠并且还在阻挠伟大的社会主义建设潜力充分发挥，我们尤其该感到自豪了。
    苏联人民在自己亲爱的共产党的领导下，建成了一个没有人剥削人、没有政治和民族压迫的新社会。在这个基础上，我们国家建立了人和人之间新的关系，工人、农民和知识分子、全体苏联人民之间的兄弟般的、友好合作的关系（掌声）。
    我国全体劳动人民有着同一个目标和同一个任务——保证我们祖国的进一步繁荣和强大，使得人民的物质和文化水平迅速提高，为使全体苏联人民生活得一天比一天美好而不倦地努力（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    凡是为达到这个伟大的崇高的目标而从事的真诚劳动，在我国都受到重视和尊重。工业、建筑、交通邮电各部门的男女工人、工程和技术人员及其他职员、男女集体农民、所有的农业工作人员、贸易工作人员——所有在为我国创造并扩大财富的劳动者；在为技术的进步、为征服自然力和减轻人类劳动创造新的可能性的科学工作者；致力于对苏联人民进行共产主义教育这个崇高事业的教育、文学和艺术工作者；保证苏联人民健康的忘我的医务工作者；拥有许多胜利的荣耀的英雄的苏联陆海军军人——所有的苏联人民，都是新生活的创造者和建设者。由于他们的忘我劳动，我们的国家才有现在的伟大和光荣（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    苏维埃人满怀信心地、愉快地、勇敢地展望着他的明天。他们知道，共产党把全部力量献给了他的幸福，献给了我们的光荣的祖国的和平发展和繁荣（经久不息的掌声）。
    我们的伟大的、英雄的人民万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    我们自己的共产党——我们所有的胜利的鼓舞者和组织者——万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）祝我们的祖国为了全体苏联人民的幸福和愉快而日益繁荣！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）
    在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜下向新的胜利前进！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的欢呼声。全体起立。）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十三日电）
