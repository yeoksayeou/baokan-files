    Vegetable Cooperatives in the Suburbs of Beijing and Shenyang Develop Greatly
    Vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing and Shenyang have developed greatly. In the suburbs of Beijing, they have grown from twenty cooperatives last year to one hundred and four. In Shenyang, there were eleven cooperatives last year, and it is expected to grow to twenty-seven this year. The cooperatives are now actively preparing for production.
    Last year, the vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing generally had a bumper harvest, fully meeting the needs of the people in the capital. Due to the superiority shown by the vegetable production cooperatives in increasing vegetable production, many vegetable farmers in the suburbs were attracted to actively join the cooperatives. The number of vegetable production cooperatives in the entire suburb has now grown from twenty last year to one hundred and four, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. Currently, both new and old cooperatives are formulating production plans and actively preparing for spring production. The Yin Weichen Cooperative plans to produce four million jin of vegetables this year to meet the needs of the people in the capital. The Li Zonghe Cooperative, after expansion, plans to buy three diesel engines to replace animal-powered waterwheels, and has also signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 100,000 jin of potato seeds. The cooperative has now begun repairing and irrigating 8,900 leek ridges, and thirteen or fourteen large carts are being dispatched daily to haul manure. Many other cooperatives have also begun preparing land for fertilization, building hotbeds, and sowing seeds for seedling cultivation.
    Vegetable production in the suburbs of Shenyang also achieved a bumper harvest last year. After the publicity of the General Line, the enthusiasm of vegetable farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation is very high. The number of vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs of the city has recently increased from eleven last year to seventeen. It is expected that it can be developed to twenty-seven this year. Now vegetable farmers are expanding vegetable field area and preparing to increase vegetable production.

    北京沈阳两市郊区蔬菜合作社有很大发展
    北京市、沈阳市郊区蔬菜生产合作社有很大发展，北京市郊区，已由去年的二十个社发展到一百零四个；沈阳市去年有十一个社，今年预计可发展到二十七个社。现在各社正积极准备生产。
    去年北京市郊区蔬菜生产合作社的蔬菜普遍获得丰收，充分供应了首都人民的需要。由于蔬菜生产合作社在蔬菜增产上表现的优越性，吸引了郊区许多菜农积极入社。全郊区蔬菜生产合作社现在已由去年的二十个发展到一百零四个，占郊区农业生产合作社总数的三分之一以上。目前新社老社正制订生产计划，积极准备春季生产。殷维臣社今年要生产四百万斤菜，供应首都人民需要；李宗和社扩大后，准备买三台柴油机，代替畜力水车，又和供销社订了合同，购买十万斤土豆种子。该社现已开始为八千九百畦韭菜修畦灌畦，每天还有十三、四辆大车出动拉粪。其他许多社都已开始进行整地送粪、打阳畦、下种育苗等工作。
    沈阳市郊区的蔬菜生产去年也获得丰收。经过总路线的宣传，菜农要求参加互助合作的情绪很高。该市郊区蔬菜生产合作社最近已由去年十一个社发展到十七个社。预计今年可发展到二十七个社。现在菜农正扩大菜田面积，准备增产蔬菜。
