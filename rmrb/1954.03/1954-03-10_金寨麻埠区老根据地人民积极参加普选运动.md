    People in the old revolutionary base area of Mapu District, Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, have plunged into the general election movement with high political enthusiasm and the attitude of being masters of their own affairs.
    Mapu District is one of the old revolutionary base areas in the Dabie Mountains. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the worker-peasant democratic government here led the masses in a vigorous revolutionary struggle. Later, when the Red Army went north, this area was occupied by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the enemy used the brutal policy of "burning, killing, and looting" to frantically destroy the people. However, the people in the old revolutionary area, rich in revolutionary tradition, never succumbed to the enemy for the sake of freedom, democracy, and happiness. They had stubbornly persisted in the struggle against the enemy, regardless of bloodshed and sacrifice. After liberation, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of Mapu District rebuilt their homes, and their lives have become better day by day.
    This year in February, the general election movement began here. The people of Mapu District deeply realized from their own experiences that today's democratic life did not come easily, so they actively participated in the general election activities with the mood of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory." The district's vast number of party members, league members, propagandists, mass activists, and folk artists actively participated in propaganda activities. They used propaganda forms and tools such as chats, local broadcasts, blackboards, flower drum lanterns, storytelling with drums, dramas, and flower sticks to widely publicize the principles of the general election to the masses, so that the people of the entire district generally received one to two educations. The voters also expressed their determination to do a good job in the general election and further consolidate the people's democratic regime in order to create a better life. Voters Yuan Yongyi and Chen Liheng from Yueya Township said: Our right to vote was exchanged for blood and flesh. If we don't do a good job in the general election, we will be truly sorry for the revolutionary martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed. Peng Deyin, a voter from Linbu Township, said: "This time, we must keep our eyes wide open and elect the most satisfactory person as a representative." Liu Shiru, the women's committee member of Yueya Township, said: "Women can also participate in elections and be masters of their own affairs. This is a political right exchanged for blood and flesh. I must lead my sisters to actively participate in the general election." Grandma Xie, who is over seventy years old in the township, has brought her four daughters-in-law to every meeting from the beginning of the general election until now. Encouraged by the general election movement, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the people throughout the district have significantly increased, thereby promoting various production tasks. Now the whole district has planted 6,499 mu of jute, built eight large ponds, and hoed over 11,600 mu of wheat once or twice, of which 5,100 mu of wheat have been fertilized once. All 145 mu of jute land in Sanwan Township has been planted, and farmers have also bought more than 10,300 jin of cake fertilizer to apply to the jute land, striving to harvest more jute this year to support national industrial construction.

    金寨麻埠区老根据地人民积极参加普选运动
    老革命根据地安徽省金寨县麻埠区人民，以高度的政治热情和当家作主的姿态投入普选运动。
    麻埠区是大别山区的老革命根据地之一。在第二次国内革命战争时期，在共产党领导下，这里的工农民主政权领导群众进行了轰轰烈烈的革命斗争。后来红军北上，这一带被国民党反动派盘踞，敌人就以“烧、杀、抢”的残酷政策，疯狂地摧残人民。可是富有革命传统的老区人民，为了自由、民主和幸福，始终没有向敌人屈服，他们曾不顾流血牺牲，顽强地坚持了对敌斗争。解放后，在共产党和人民政府的领导和扶助下，麻埠区人民重建了家园，日子一天比一天好过了。
    今年二月，普选运动在这里开始了。麻埠区人民从亲身经历中，深深认识到今天民主生活来之不易，因此都怀着“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的心情，积极地参加了普选活动。该区广大党员、团员、宣传员、群众积极分子和民间艺人都积极参加宣传活动，他们运用漫谈会、土广播、黑板报、花鼓灯、大鼓书、话剧、花棍等宣传形式和宣传工具，向群众广泛宣传普选道理，使全区人民普遍受到了一次到两次教育。选民们也表示决心做好普选工作，进一步巩固人民民主政权，以便创造更美好的生活。月牙乡选民袁永义、陈立恒说：我们的选举权是用血肉换来的，要是不把普选搞好，真对不起为革命流血牺牲的先烈们。临埠乡选民彭德银说：“这次要把眼睛擦得亮亮的，选举最满意的人当代表。”月牙乡妇女委员刘世茹说：“妇女也能参加选举当家做主人，这是血肉换来的政治权利，我一定要领导姊妹们积极参加普选。”该乡七十多岁的谢老奶奶，从普选开始到现在，每次开会都带着四个媳妇到场。在普选运动的鼓舞下，全区人民的政治热情与生产积极性有显著提高，从而推动了各项生产工作。现在全区已经种上大麻六千四百九十九亩，兴修大塘八口，并有一万一千六百多亩麦子锄过一遍到两遍，其中还有五千一百亩麦子施了一次肥。三湾乡一百四十五亩麻地已全部种好，农民们还买了一万零三百多斤饼肥施到麻地里，争取今年多收麻，支援国家工业建设。
