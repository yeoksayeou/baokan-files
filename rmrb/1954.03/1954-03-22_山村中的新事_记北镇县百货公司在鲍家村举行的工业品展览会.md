    ——A Record of the Industrial Products Exhibition Held by the Beizhen County Department Store in Baojia Village
    Cheng Jianzhong
    In February of this year, employees of the Beizhen County Company of the China Department Store of Liaoxi Province, loaded over six hundred kinds of commodities needed by farmers and went to Baojia Village, twenty-five li from the city, for an exhibition.

    The exhibition room was filled with brightly colored industrial products, including various new floral fabrics, floral quilt covers,绒衣 (róng yī, woolen or knitted underwear), rubber shoes, floral socks, and cosmetics that women loved; common household white iron pots; paper and fountain pens needed by elementary school students; and production tools such as rubber tires, thick and thin iron wires, etc. On the walls were also hung comparative charts of industrial and agricultural product prices over the past few years, and pictures of the happy and joyful lives of farmers in Soviet collective farms.

    The area in front of the exhibition room was packed with people. Middle-aged women held children, seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls wore new clothes, and elderly people led their little grandchildren. Farmers from Ningjiatun Village, five li away from Baojia Village, came to visit in small donkey carts. Many women wearing new clothes came from Yuanjiaosi Village, fifteen li away. Everyone wanted to broaden their horizons.

    Inside the exhibition room, some people were pondering the patterns of various floral fabrics, while others were carefully examining all kinds of household utensils. Grandfathers and grandsons discussed what kind of pens and notebooks to buy, and little girls pulled their mothers asking for small floral handkerchiefs and rubber balls. Farmers were stroking the rubber tire treads. People's representatives who came to visit from Yuanjiaosi Village, after figuring out what they wanted, had the cooperative's salesman from their village write them down one by one. Old man Wu Shunjiang, pointing to a "Yuanzhu" brand ballpoint pen priced at over ten thousand yuan, said: "I've figured it out completely, it’s too cheap for elementary school students to use this thing, they can write without dipping in water, I must buy everything they need for the children so they can study hard."

    After the exhibition, a discussion began, and people enthusiastically talked about the things they liked. Seventeen or eighteen-year-old girls liked duck-egg green fabric with small flowers, socks with stripes and "pepper eyes," kerchiefs with phoenixes, and white rubber shoes. Middle-aged women wanted small floral fabrics, dark blue drill, and blue-green sports shoes. Old ladies wanted good-quality dark drill and old bronze-colored socks. The girl who was the hygiene committee member also said she wanted sanitary belts. Middle-aged farmers who worked in the fields wanted "water socks," serge and corduroy in bronze and blue, and "yuanbao" style rubber shoes to wear on rainy and cloudy days. Farmers who grew grapes said: Now is the time to move grape trellises, and two thousand catties of thick iron wire would be useful. Everyone raised many suggestions about the products. Middle-aged farmers said "water socks" are good for working in the fields, but they tend to break at the bottom; women complained that the colors of the drill were not good; the blue and green sports shoes were too large; the elderly said that the rubber shoes were all five-eyelet, and easy slip on shoes should be prepared for the elderly; and women with children complained that the pullover sanitary shirts were not good for breastfeeding, and they wanted front-opening ones.

    After seeing the exhibition, people talked about it as they walked home. Seeing the pictures of the happy lives of farmers in Soviet collective farms, they thought of this village at the foot of Mount Yiwulü, and the bountiful harvests in every family's orchard during the autumn harvest season, as if they saw an increasingly close happy life.

    After visiting the exhibition and listening to the farmers' opinions, the Baojia Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative immediately increased eighty-one kinds of commodities according to the needs and requirements of the farmers, and submitted a purchase plan of 99.6 million yuan to the department store.

    山村中的新事
    ——记北镇县百货公司在鲍家村举行的工业品展览会
    程建中
    今年二月里，中国百货公司辽西省北镇县公司的职工，装载了六百来种农民需要的商品，到离城二十五里地的鲍家村去展览。
    展览室里摆满了色泽鲜艳的工业品，有妇女们喜爱的各种新鲜花布、花被面、绒衣、胶鞋、花袜子、化妆品；有家常用的白铁锅；小学生需要的纸、钢笔；生产用具胶皮轮胎、粗细铁丝等。墙上还挂着几年来工、农业产品价格比较图表，和苏联集体农庄农民的幸福愉快生活的图片。
    展览室门前挤满了人。中年妇女抱着小孩，十七、八岁的姑娘穿着新鲜衣服，老年人领着小孙子。离鲍家村五里地的宁家屯农民，套着小驴车来参观。十五里地元角寺村，来了许多穿着新衣服的妇女。大家都要来开开眼界。
    展览室里，有的人在琢磨各色花布的花样，有的在端详各式各样家常用具。爷爷和孙子商量买啥样笔和本子，小姑娘拉着妈妈要小花手绢和皮球。农民在抚摸着胶皮车带。元角寺村来参观的人民代表，琢磨好了自己要的东西，就让他们村的合作社营业员一样一样的记下来。吴顺江老大爷，指着售价一万多元一支的“圆珠”牌钢笔说：“我算瞅透啦，小学生用这玩艺太便宜啦，不用沾水就能写字，我一定给小孩买齐全，让他好好学习。”
    展览后，座谈会开始了，人们热烈地谈论着自己喜欢的东西。十七、八岁的姑娘喜欢鸭蛋青地带小花的花布、带道道带胡椒眼的袜子、有凤凰的包袱皮、白胶鞋。中年妇女要小花布、深色蓝士林、青蓝运动鞋。老太太要成色好的青士林、老古铜色的袜子。做卫生委员的姑娘，还说要月经带。下地的中年农民要“水袜子”，人字呢和古铜色、蓝色的灯芯绒，下雨阴天穿的元宝式胶鞋。种葡萄的农民说：现在正好挪葡萄架，有二千斤粗铁丝也能要。大家对商品提了不少意见。中年农民说“水袜子”下地穿好是好，就是爱折底；妇女们嫌靠士林颜色不好；青、蓝运动鞋号码大；老年人说胶鞋都是五眼的，应给上岁数的人准备元口便鞋；有孩子的妇女嫌套头的卫生衣给孩子吃奶不好，要对襟的。
    人们看完了展览会，在回家的路上还一边走一边谈论着。他们看到苏联集体农庄农民的幸福生活图片，联想起这个在医巫闾山下的村庄，每当秋收季节，每家果园里的丰收的景象，仿佛也看到了越来越近的幸福生活。
    鲍家镇供销合作社，在参观展览会和听了农民的意见后，马上按照农民的需要和要求，增加了八十一种商品，向百货公司提出了九千九百六十万元的进货计划。
