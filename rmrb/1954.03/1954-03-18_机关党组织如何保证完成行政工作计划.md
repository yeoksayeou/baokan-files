How Party Organizations in Government Agencies Ensure the Completion of Administrative Work Plans
The Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs

The Party organizations in Hebei provincial directly subordinate organs have been working for more than four years. During this period, the provincial directly subordinate organs have achieved considerable success and accumulated some experience in striving to realize the Party's political tasks at various times and ensuring the administrative work of the organs through their own propaganda, education, and organizational work.

The primary Party organizations in government agencies, when fulfilling the four tasks stipulated in Article 52 of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, must primarily mobilize and organize the masses to ensure the implementation of the administrative plans of the agency and struggle against phenomena that hinder the implementation of these plans. From this, it can be seen that continuously strengthening political and ideological leadership, overcoming unhealthy tendencies, and ensuring the completion of administrative work plans are regular and important tasks of Party organizations in government agencies. In fulfilling the responsibilities and obligations entrusted to them by the Party Constitution, Party organizations in government agencies must always pay attention to the following three issues:

    I. Party Activities Must be Closely Integrated with Administrative Work

Party organizations in government agencies do not have the authority to supervise the administrative work of the agency, but the primary Party organizations bear a certain responsibility for the quality of the agency's work. Therefore, how to regularly and closely integrate political and ideological work with departmental business work is the key for primary Party organizations to realize their guaranteeing role in the work of the agency. Experience has shown that wherever this is done well, the work of the branch is vigorous, prestigious, powerful, and effective; otherwise, it is just empty talk about strengthening political and ideological leadership, and the political work of the Party organization will become detached from administrative business work. At the same time, it proves that the primary Party organizations in government agencies can strengthen the Party's role in the work of the agency by not replacing the Party groups and administrative leaders of the agency. These methods mainly include:

    Utilizing various Party activities to exert the Party's role and expand the Party's influence. For example, in the urgent task of completing the 1952 final accounts and preparing the 1953 budget, the Finance Department, after the administrative system made arrangements, the Party organization mobilized Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, who then led all cadres to universally formulate plans to ensure the completion of this task. During the work process, the branch grasped the main ideological obstacles and launched criticism and self-criticism through a series of meetings, thereby completing this urgent task ahead of schedule.

    Strictly supervise Party members to exemplarily implement the Party's policies, abide by government laws and regulations, and observe work discipline. For example, Liu Geping (a Communist Party member), the former Director of the Supply Department of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, seriously engaged in decentralism and undermined the state's price policy. Before the price adjustment, he arbitrarily decided to sell a large quantity of materials, causing a very bad influence. The Party seriously dealt with this issue and announced it at the general meeting of all cadres in the provincial cooperative trade departments, thereby arousing the vigilance of the Party organizations in these departments against decentralism and safeguarding the Party's policies and government laws and regulations.

    Always pay attention to inspiring the enthusiasm and creativity of Party and non-Party cadres, and constantly improve the efficiency of the work of the agency. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, there was a general state of backlog and chaos in varying degrees in the various agencies directly under the province. Based on this situation, the Party organizations of the agencies comprehensively launched a work competition movement. With the support of the administrative responsible cadres in each unit, the cadres of each agency generally examined their work methods and systems, put forward different slogans of effort based on the main problems existing at that time, formulated departmental and individual plans for improving work, and revised unreasonable work systems. Through this movement, everyone made many creations in work methods, and work efficiency and quality were improved. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,500 rationalization proposals were put forward in the work competition. After evaluation, 972 people were commended, and 81 various models emerged, setting examples for the work of the agency.

    Always pay attention to the main problems existing and occurring in the work of the agency, and provide suggestions to the person in charge of the agency or report to the higher-level Party committee. For example, the Cotton Inspection Institute of the Hebei Provincial Finance and Economic Commission had never determined its leadership relationship since its establishment. It was first managed by the Cooperative Trade Office, and then changed to be managed by the General Office, but neither managed it seriously. The cadres of the Cotton Inspection Institute had principled differences in their work, but no one solved them, resulting in disunity among the cadres and chaotic work. The Party organization discovered this problem, reported it to the administrative leaders in a timely manner, and resolved the thinking of the Party member cadres from within the Party.

    Uniting and educating non-Party cadres and all young people through the organizations of the trade union and the Communist Youth League plays an important role in doing a good job in the work of the agency. Appropriately arranging the cultural and sports life of the agency cadres through the activities of the trade union and the Communist Youth League is also an aspect that cannot be ignored. The agencies directly under the province have certain cultural and sports activities every week, and hold various entertainment parties. These activities have a major positive effect on enlivening the life of the agency and strengthening the education of collectivism.

    Of course, at present, in the aspect of combining the Party's political and ideological work and the administrative work of the agency in the province, from the perspective of the Party organization's work itself, there are still many shortcomings. There are still many primary organizations that have not fully exerted their role in the work of the agency. They often limit their work to a very narrow scope, often only managing some trivial matters, or only paying attention to the personal lives of Party members (of course, solving the incorrect thinking in the lives of Party members is also an aspect of ideological leadership that cannot be ignored by the branch), but they do not pay attention to or ignore the major issues in the work of the agency. For example, the former Heavy Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department, since the establishment of the organization, because of "overstaffing," the cadres had nothing to do when they went to work. Over time, it caused serious chaos in the organization and the thinking of the cadres; however, the Heavy Industry Bureau branch did not pay attention to this serious problem, nor did it solve the phenomenon of ideological chaos that occurred in the bureau. After the disclosure by Party members, it was reported to the higher-level Party committee. After the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the branch combined with the administrative leaders to solve this problem. Similar situations to the Heavy Industry Bureau branch have occurred or still exist in other departments.

    II. The Spirit of Struggle Against Unhealthy Tendencies Must be Consistently Implemented in Various Party Activities

In the Party organizations of directly subordinate agencies, in addition to regular Party days every week, many branches can regularly summarize the ideological situation of Party member cadres and report it at the Party member assembly in a timely manner, which is of extremely important significance for overcoming various unhealthy tendencies within the Party in a timely manner. In addition, after the "Three-Anti" movement, under the leadership of the higher-level Party, the Party organization also prominently grasped the solution of some key issues. In the work competition movement after the "Three-Anti" campaign, it focused on opposing the conservative thinking that hindered the improvement of work and the work style of procrastination and backlog. In the first half of last year, it made every effort to oppose bureaucracy and decentralism. Later, it timely launched a struggle against certain bourgeois ideas that were spreading and growing.

Experience has shown that constantly opposing bureaucracy, decentralism, and bourgeois ideology is an important condition for ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's general line and various policies in the work of the agency.

The central link in carrying out the struggle against unhealthy tendencies lies in correctly promoting criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up. The Party organizations of various agencies directly under the province have formed a system for handling and reviewing appeals and accusations of Party members, so that the requirements and opinions of the lower levels are constantly reflected. According to incomplete statistics from the Provincial Directly Subordinate Party Committee alone, a total of 428 appeals, accusations, and review cases were handled in 1953 alone. The development of criticism has further improved the sense of responsibility of Communist Party members to struggle against all phenomena that harm the interests of the Party. In 1951, in the operation of a military industrial task, the Native Produce Management Department of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative falsely reported accounts and illegally obtained profits due to the capitalist management thinking of the leading cadres of the department. Li Wenzhou, a Communist Party member in the department, bravely exposed this error and received strong support from the leadership.

The method of grasping typical examples and carrying out mass criticism and self-criticism through various forms (such as meetings, branch life tabloids, etc.) based on the main ideological problems existing in the Party in different periods is also very effective. After last year's struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of laws and disciplines, the Provincial Directly Subordinate Party Committee, based on the bourgeois individualism ideas of some Party member cadres who were not content with their jobs, made trouble about their position and treatment, took Li Jie, a cadre of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, as a typical example and organized all Party members in the directly subordinate agencies to discuss it in the Party's branch life tabloid. Many branches organized special discussions for this purpose. As a result, not only Li Jie himself was educated, but also all Party members in the agencies directly under the province were alerted to the bourgeois individualism ideas from Li Jie's mistakes. Many Party members examined similar wrong ideas and facts as Li Jie's in the tabloid and expressed their determination to correct them. At present, many branches have gradually become familiar with the method of educating the general public through typical examples, constantly summarizing good people and good deeds and criticizing bad people and bad deeds, and have learned to put forward what to establish and what to oppose according to the ideological situation of a certain period, thereby laying a good foundation for daily ideological education and the struggle against unhealthy tendencies.

However, at present, in the Party organizations of the directly subordinate agencies in the province, criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up, is far from satisfactory. The biggest problem is that some Party grassroots organizations do not provide enough support for criticism, and the phenomenon of harmony is still very serious in some departments and among some Party members, which must be continued to be resolved in the future.

    III. Conscientiously Lead the Study of Party Members and Non-Party Cadres in Government Agencies

Comrade Stalin said: "The higher the political level and the degree of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff in any department of national work and Party work, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work" (Summary report on the work of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) Central Committee at the 18th Party Congress). Therefore, using the method of organizing and leading learning to continuously improve the political, theoretical, and ideological level of Party and non-Party cadres in government agencies is an important condition for improving the work in various links and ensuring the completion of the work tasks of the agencies, so it is also one of the most important regular tasks of the Party organizations in the agencies.

In the past four years, the Party organizations of the directly subordinate agencies in the province have attached importance to leading the study of Party and non-Party cadres. The Party organizations of the agencies have regarded leading study as one of the important daily tasks. After the "Three-Anti" movement, a theoretical education network was generally established in the directly subordinate agencies in the province, a theoretical school was established, and responsible cadres were hired as theoretical teachers, so that theoretical study gradually became regular. At the same time, because special attention was paid to the combination of theory and practice and the combination of political tasks in various periods in the study, it has been of great help to improving the thinking of cadres, broadening their horizons, improving their work, and opposing unhealthy tendencies.

In order to meet the needs of the vast number of cadres for studying current affairs policies, a current affairs policy lecture is held once a week under normal circumstances. The reporters are generally provincial-level leading comrades and heads of various departments. This has played a great role in urging cadres to study current affairs policies. The cultural learning of cadres in the directly subordinate agencies of the province is directly led by the Cadre Spare-time School. The agency branches constantly check the cultural learning of cadres, commend the good, criticize the bad, and constantly put forward opinions on the educational policy of the spare-time school.

To do these tasks well, the work level of the Party organization itself must be continuously improved. Our work is gradually improving, and some basic issues (such as the nature and tasks of the agency branch) are also gradually clarified. The most important problem existing in the current Party organizations of the agencies is that the collective leadership system of the committees in many primary organizations is not sound or is not implemented strictly. Committee meetings are often not convened according to the system, and some work (such as formulating work plans) is often decided by a few people in violation of the principle of collective leadership, which affects the improvement of the work level of the Party organization. Secondly, some primary organization work still lacks the necessary initiative and creative work style, and often rigidly moves the instructions and plans of the higher-level organizations without being good at appropriately and actively arranging the work of the Party according to the specific circumstances of the agency. This makes the work of the Party organization often passive, and it is also weak and powerless in guaranteeing the administrative work. Therefore, how to guide the primary organizations to always pay attention to the close combination of political work and business work in the future, so as to truly fulfill the responsibilities stipulated by the Party Constitution and the Party's general line in the transition period, is still a serious problem. In addition, in the past, the directly subordinate Party committee and various primary organizations did not often summarize and exchange the experience of branch work, so that the primary organizations could not absorb experience and improve their work in a timely manner. In the future, the directly subordinate Party committee plans to solve this problem by holding branch secretary meetings and conducting special seminars on a regular basis.

The Party member cadres in charge of the administrative work of the agencies must attach importance to the work of the agency branches. The Party member cadres in charge of the administrative work of the agencies have the responsibility and obligation to rely on the Party's political activities to ensure the completion of the work entrusted to them by the higher-level Party and its administrative directly subordinate superiors. The Party member cadres in charge of the administrative work of the agencies can better complete their work only by correctly relying on the strength of the Party organization. Therefore, the Party member cadres in charge of the administrative work of the agencies should attach importance to the work of the branch and actively participate in the Party's activities and exemplarily implement the resolutions of the branch committee or Party member assembly. The experience of the past few years has proved that wherever this is done well, not only is the work of the branch active, but also the administrative work is easy to complete smoothly. On the contrary, all kinds of work cannot proceed smoothly. The main problem existing in this regard at present is that some Party member cadres who are responsible for administrative work, although they participate in the branch committee, are only a formality. They cannot actively participate in the Party's various meetings, and regard participating in the branch committee as a burden. Some even those who are in charge of political work as deputy posts also neglect the work of the branch. This is obviously a mistake, and also shows that the Party organization still lacks active measures in this regard.

    机关党组织如何保证完成行政工作计划
    中共河北省直属机关委员会
    中共河北省直属机关党组织已有四年多的工作基础了。在这个期间内，省直属机关党组织，通过自己的宣传教育工作和组织工作，在努力实现党的各个时期的政治任务，保证机关行政工作等方面，都有不少成绩，同时也摸索出一些经验。
    机关党的基础组织，在履行中国共产党党章第五十二条所规定的四项任务时，最主要的就是动员和组织群众保证本机关行政计划之实施，并与阻碍这些计划实施的现象进行斗争。由此可知，不断地加强政治思想领导，克服不良倾向，保证机关行政工作计划的完成，乃是机关党组织的经常的、重要的任务。机关党组织在履行党章所赋予自己的责任与义务中，必须经常注意以下三个问题：
      一、党的活动要紧密结合
          行政工作
    机关党组织对机关行政工作没有监督的职权，但机关工作的好坏，党的基础组织负有一定责任。因此，怎样把政治思想工作和部门业务工作经常密切结合起来，是党基础组织实现自己在机关工作中保证作用的关键。经验证明：凡是在这一点上作得好的，支部工作就生气勃勃，威信高，有力量，有效果；反之则是空喊加强政治思想领导，并且会使党组织的政治工作与行政业务工作脱节。同时证明：机关党基础组织可以用不是代替机关党组和机关行政领导人的办法，加强党在机关工作中的作用，这些办法主要的是：
    通过党的各种活动，发挥党的作用，扩大党的影响。例如财政厅在完成一九五二年决算和编造一九五三年预算的紧急任务中，行政系统布置以后，党的组织向党员、团员作了动员，由党员、团员带动全体干部普遍订立了保证完成这一任务的计划。在工作过程中，支部又抓住主要思想障碍，通过一系列的会议，开展了批评与自我批评，从而使这一紧急任务提前完成了。
    严格地监督党员模范地执行党的政策、遵守政府法令及工作纪律。比如河北省供销合作总社前供应处长刘格平（共产党员）因为严重的分散主义，破坏国家物价政策，乘价格调整前，擅自决定大批出售物资，造成很坏的影响。党对这一问题作了严肃的处理，并在省级合作贸易部门的全体干部大会上公布，从而引起了这些部门党组织对于分散主义的警惕，维护了党的政策和政府的法令。
    经常注意启发党与非党干部的积极性、创造性，不断地提高机关工作的效能。“三反”以后，省直属各机关中普遍存在着程度不同的工作积压和制度混乱的状态。机关党组织根据这一情况，全面开展了
  一次机关工作竞赛运动。在各单位行政负责干部的支持下，各机关干部普遍检查了自己的工作方法、制度，根据当时存在的主要问题，提出不同的努力口号，订出了部门的和个人的改进工作的计划，修订了不合理的工作制度。经过这次运动，大家在工作方法上有许多创造，工作效率和质量都有提高。据不完全统计，工作竞赛中共提出合理化建议一千五百余件。经过评比，受到表扬者达九百七十二人，并涌现出各种模范八十一人，树立起机关工作的榜样。
    经常注意机关工作中存在和发生的主要问题，并向机关负责人提供自己的建议或向上级党委反映。如河北省财政经济委员会的棉检所，自从这个组织建立之后，领导关系一直也没有确定，先由合作贸易处管理，后又改为办公室管理，但都没有认真管理起来。棉检所的干部在工作中发生了原则性的分歧，没人解决，以致形成干部不团结，工作混乱。党组织发现了这一问题，及时反映给行政领导干部，并从党内解决党员干部的思想。
    通过工会和青年团的组织，团结教育非党干部和全体青年，对于作好机关工作有着重要作用。通过工会和团的活动适当安排机关干部的文化体育生活，也是不可忽视的方面。省直属机关每周有一定的文化体育活动，并召开各种各样的娱乐晚会。这些活动，对于活跃机关生活、加强集体主义思想教育等，都有着重大的积极作用。
    当然，目前省直属机关在党的政治思想工作和机关行政工作的结合方面，从党组织工作本身说，也还存在着许多缺点。还有好多基础组织并没有充分发挥它在机关工作中的作用，它们往往把自己的工作局限在非常狭隘的范围之内，经常只去管理一些琐碎的事务，或仅是注意党员的个人生活问题（当然解决党员生活方面的不正确思想也是支部进行思想领导的一个不可忽视的方面），而对于机关工作中的重大问题，反而不加重视或置之不理。比如工业厅的前重工业局，自建立机构以后，因为“人浮于事”，干部上班无事可做，久而久之造成了组织上和干部思想上的严重混乱；而重工业局支部对这一严重问题，却未引起注意，对局内所发生的思想混乱的现象也没有解决。经过党员的揭发，反映到上级党委，经过上级党委的指示，支部才结合行政领导干部解决了这一问题。类似重工业局支部这样的情形，在其他一些部门也曾发生或现在仍存在着。
    二、党的各种活动要始终贯彻
          反不良倾向斗争的精神
    在直属机关党组织中，除每周有定期的党日外，不少支部都能定期的总结党员干部的思想情况，并及时在党员大会上进行报告，这对及时克服党内各种不良倾向有极其重要的意义。除此之外，“三反”运动以后，在上级党的领导下，党组织还突出地抓住解决了一些关键性的问题。在“三反”以后的工作竞赛运动中，着重反对了妨碍改进工作的保守思想和拖拉积压的工作作风。去年上半年全力进行了反对官僚主义、分散主义的斗争。以后，又及时地向正在蔓延滋长着的某些资产阶级思想展开斗争。
    经验证明：不断地反对官僚主义、分散主义和资产阶级思想，乃是保证在机关工作中正确贯彻党的总路线及各项政策的一个重要条件。
    开展反不良倾向斗争的中心环节，在于正确发扬批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。省直属各机关党的组织处理和审查党员的申诉、控告，已经形成一种制度，从而使下层的要求和意见，不断反映上来。仅据省直属党委的不完全统计，一九五三年一年中共处理申诉、控告、复议案件四百二十八件。批评的开展也更进一步地提高了共产党员向一切违害党的利益的现象进行斗争的责任感。省供销合作社土产经理部在一九五一年经营一件军工任务中，由于该处领导干部存有资本主义的经营思想，竟假报账目，非法获取利润。该部共产党员李文周勇敢地揭发了这一错误，得到领导上的有力支持。
    根据不同时期党内存在的主要思想问题，抓住典型，通过各种形式（如会议、支部生活小报等）开展群众性的批评与自我批评的方法，也是非常有效的。去年反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪斗争以后，省直属党委曾根据党内存在的某些党员干部不安心本职工作、闹地位、闹待遇等资产阶级个人主义思想，以青年团省委干部李杰为典型，在党内的支部生活小报上，组织了省直属机关全体党员讨论。好多支部为此组织了专题讨论。这样做的结果受到教育的不只是李杰本人，省直属机关全体党员也都从李杰错误中引起了对资产阶级个人主义思想的警惕，不少党员在小报上检讨了与李杰类似的错误思想和事实，表示决心改正。目前许多支部也逐步熟习了通过典型教育一般的方法，不断总结好人好事和批判坏人坏事，学会了根据一定时期的思想情况，提出树立什么和反对什么的作法，从而为日常的思想教育工作和反对不良倾向的斗争奠定了良好的基础。
    不过，目前在省直属机关党组织内，批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评开展得还远远不能令人满意。其中最大问题是某些党的基层组织对批评的支持还很不够，在某些部门和某些党员当中一团和气的现象还很严重，这是今后必须继续努力解决的。
    三、认真领导机关党员
          与非党干部的学习
    斯大林同志说：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力”（在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共
  （布）中央工作的总结报告）。因此，用组织和领导学习的方法，不断提高机关党与非党干部的政治、理论和思想水平，是改进各个环节的工作和保证机关完成工作任务的重要条件，所以也是机关党组织经常的最重要的任务之一。
    过去四年多来省直属机关党组织对领导党与非党干部的学习是重视的。机关党组织已把领导学习作为日常的重要的工作之一。“三反”运动以后，在省直属机关普遍建立了理论教育网，建立了理论学校，聘请负责干部担任理论教员，使理论学习逐步走向正规。同时由于在学习中特别注意了理论联系实际和结合各个时期政治任务，因而对提高干部思想，开阔眼界，改进工作，反对不良倾向，均有很大帮助。
    为了满足广大干部时事政策学习的要求，在一般情况下每周举办一次时事政策讲座，报告人一般是省一级的领导同志和各部门的负责人。这对督促干部的时事政策学习起了很大作用。省直属机关干部的文化学习由干部业余学校直接领导。机关支部不断检查干部的文化学习情况，表扬好的，批评坏的，并对业余学校的教育方针不断提出意见。
    要做好这些工作，机关党组织本身工作水平必须不断提高。我们的工作是逐步提高的，在一些基本问题上（如机关支部的性质与任务）也是逐步明确的。当前机关党组织中存在的最主要的问题是，不少基础组织中委员会的集体领导制还不健全或执行得很不严格。委员会议常常不能按制度召开，有些工作（如制定工作计划）往往是在违背集体领导的原则下由少数人所决定的，这就影响了党组织工作水平的提高。其次有些基础组织工作中还缺乏应有的主动精神和创造性的工作作风，往往是死板地搬运上级组织的指示、计划，而不善于根据本机关的具体情况恰当地、主动地安排党的工作。这样便使党组织的工作经常处于被动，在对行政工作的保证上，也软弱无力。因此，今后如何引导各基础组织经常注意政治工作与业务工作的密切结合，从而真正尽到党章和党在过渡时期总路线所给我们规定的责任，仍是一个严重的问题。此外，过去直属党委和各个基础组织都没有经常总结和交流支部工作经验，以致各基础组织不能及时吸取经验改进工作。今后直属党委准备用经常召开支部书记会议和进行专题座谈的方法来解决这一问题。
    机关行政负责党员干部对机关支部工作必须重视。机关行政负责党员干部有责任有义务依靠党的政治活动来保证完成上级党及其行政直属上级所委托给自己的工作，行政负责党员干部只有正确依靠了党组织力量，才能更好地完成自己的工作。因此机关行政负责党员干部应该重视支部工作，并积极参加党的活动，模范地执行支部委员会或党员大会的决议。几年来的经验证明，凡是在这点上作得好的，不只是支部工作活跃了，行政工作也易于顺利地完成。反之，则各种工作均不能顺利前进。目前在这方面存在的主要问题是：有些负行政责任的党员干部虽参加了支部委员会，但只是形式，他们不能积极地参加党的各种会议，把参加支部委员会看成是一个负担，甚至有的担任政治工作的副职也还有忽视支部工作的情形。这显然是一种错误，同时说明了党组织在这一方面还缺乏积极的措施。
