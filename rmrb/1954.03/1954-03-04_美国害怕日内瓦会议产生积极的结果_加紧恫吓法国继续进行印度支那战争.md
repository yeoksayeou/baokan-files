Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: There are eight weeks between now and April 26th, and peace-loving people are eagerly hoping that the Geneva Conference will find some peaceful methods to resolve the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. However, in recent days, the American propaganda machine has spared no effort to curse the Geneva Conference, fearing that there might be hope for peace there. The March 1st editorial of the "New York Times" shamelessly stated: "The Communist side may propose ways to seek 'reconciliation' and 'peace' in Indochina at the Geneva Conference," this method "could further alienate those in France who hope to achieve peace in Indochina from the United States," that is, to further oppose prolonging the Indochina War and opposing "pulling chestnuts out of the fire" for the United States. The New York Times even described peacefully resolving the Indochina issue as a "trap" of the Geneva Conference, and sternly ordered the French people to "be vigilant."

Of course, people do not doubt the fear of powerful groups in the United States about the possibility of the Geneva Conference leading to the restoration of peace in Indochina. However, what people cannot but be vigilant about is that the one "who has now laid a trap for the Geneva Conference" is in Washington, not anywhere else.

One example is a report by International News Service on February 27th. In this report, American officials categorically warned France that if France accepts "negotiated peace," it "may bring misfortune to the French Federation," "may seriously damage France's position as a world power," and even "will endanger France's control over the turbulent North African empire."

It is not difficult for people to see that this is the most blatant intimidation of France. To put these words bluntly: If France wants to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue through negotiation, the United States will use the pressure of the dollar or exert pressure in North Africa to deal with France.

The actual fact is that an important factor in France's weakening is the enormous expenditure of manpower, materials, and financial resources in the Indochina War, and this war is continuing under the direct intervention of the United States; similarly, it is precisely the United States that is taking advantage of France's weakness to try to turn North Africa into an American colony and military base. Even French Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs, Félix Gaillard, believes: "Some people say: People continue to fight in Indochina in exchange for dollars. But we should not rely on American aid to make our treasury's dollars abundant. Moreover, this aid is partial and far from compensating for the francs we spend in Indochina. If the Indochina War stops, our entire burden will be reduced, and our finances will be more abundant."

Therefore, if it is said that "must be vigilant," then what must be vigilant about is the trap that Washington is trying to set for the Geneva Conference.

### 美国害怕日内瓦会议产生积极的结果  加紧恫吓法国继续进行印度支那战争

    美国害怕日内瓦会议产生积极的结果
    加紧恫吓法国继续进行印度支那战争
   【新华社二日讯】从现在到四月二十六日还有八个星期，爱好和平的人民都在迫切地希望着在日内瓦会议中能够找到一些和平方法来解决朝鲜问题和印度支那问题。但是连日以来，美国宣传机构却不遗余力地诅咒日内瓦会议，唯恐在那里会有和平希望出现。三月一日“纽约时报”的社论竟公然无耻地说：“共方在日内瓦会议上可能提出在印度支那求得‘和解’与‘和平’的办法”，这个办法“可以使法国国内希望实现印度支那和平的人和美国更加疏远”，就是说更加反对延长印度支那战争，反对替美国“火中取栗”。纽约时报甚至把和平解决印度支那问题说成是日内瓦会议的“圈套”，而严厉地命令法国人民“必须戒备”。
    自然，人们并不怀疑美国的有势力集团对日内瓦会议导致印度支那恢复和平的可能性的恐惧，不过，人们不能不警惕的是，“现在已为日内瓦会议布置好了圈套”的正是在华盛顿，而不是别的什么地方。
    例证之一就是国际新闻社二月二十七日的一篇报道。在这篇报道里，美国官员们断然警告法国说，如果法国接受“协商的和平”，“可能使法兰西联邦遭到不幸”，“可能使法国作为一个世界强国的地位受到重大损失”，甚至“将危及法国对动荡不安的北非帝国的控制”。
    人们不难看到，这是对法国最露骨的恫吓。把这些话说爽直一些就是这样：如果法国要以协商方法来和平解决印度支那问题，美国就要用美元的压力或在北非施压力等来对付法国。
    实际的事实是，法国被削弱的一个重要因素正是由于在印度支那战争中消耗了大量的人力、物力和财力，而这个战争正在美国的直接干预之下继续着；同样的，也正是美国利用法国的衰弱，竭力想把北非变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。甚至法国财政经济部长富尔也认为：“有人说：人们继续在印度支那作战是为了换取美元。可是我们不应依靠美援来使我们国库的美元宽裕。何况这个援助是部分的，它远不能弥补我们在印度支那花费的法郎。假如印度支那战争停止了的话，我们的全部负担便会减少，我们的财政也将更为宽裕。”
    因此，如果要说“必须戒备”的话，那么，必须戒备的倒是华盛顿方面正在企图为日内瓦会议布置的陷阱。
