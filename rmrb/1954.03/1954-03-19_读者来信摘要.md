Reader Letters Summary

Three Suggestions on the Management of Hog Operations

Reader Cheng Weijun writes: The management of hog operations is an important task related to the daily needs of the people. Hogs are live commodities, and poor management can easily lead to death, while improper transportation can lead to a disconnect between purchasing and sales. Therefore, it is very important to strengthen the planning of hog operations. In the past, some areas suffered losses of state wealth due to a lack of planning and necessary feeding equipment in the management of hogs. To improve future work, I offer the following three suggestions:

    First, local food companies should understand the production and sales of hogs to achieve planned purchasing, transportation, and sales. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on local cooperatives and purchasing stations to conduct a survey of hog raising in the producing areas, so as to roughly grasp the monthly hog market volume, so that they can have a clear idea when compiling plans, so as to avoid excessive purchases leading to backlog sometimes, and insufficient purchases leading to market shortages sometimes. According to my understanding, some counties in Shandong rely on purchasing stations and cooperatives to implement the method of seller registration and regular sequential purchasing, which has changed the passive situation of purchasing work in the past, and further guaranteed the implementation of the plan. This experience is worth referring to in various places. Of course, it is difficult to have a very precise plan on the basis of a small-scale peasant economy; but as long as we work actively and gradually strengthen the planning of our work, it is still possible.

    Second, the current manpower and equipment for raising hogs in some areas are far from meeting the needs of purchasing work, and should be appropriately resolved. For example, the Xiaomeicun pig warehouse in Guangzhou only has sixteen workers, only has twenty-some feeding troughs, and the pig warehouse is too small. As a result, there are often too many pigs in storage. Not only is the pig warehouse crowded, but sometimes some piglets cannot get food for several days. The superior company should pay attention to these problems and vigorously assist the lower levels in specifically solving the difficulties of manpower and equipment shortages, so as to ensure that the lower-level companies have the conditions to do their work well.

    Third, a responsibility system for guaranteed transportation and feeding should be established. In the past, after hogs were purchased, they often suffered from hunger and cold during transportation, were squeezed in the pens, and were beaten, thrown, and fell when getting on and off vehicles and ships. In addition to some deaths, other pigs also became thin. The loss to the country is also quite alarming. For example, some of the pigs transported from Henan to Guangzhou last December lost more than twenty catties during transportation. However, some staff members still believe that this is an "unavoidable" phenomenon. In order to overcome this harmful thinking and avoid and reduce the phenomenon of weight loss of hogs in transportation and storage, it is necessary to conduct political education work for breeders and escorts, and strictly implement the reward and punishment system. In places where conditions permit, training classes can also be opened to impart technology and exchange experience, and some breeders and escorts can be absorbed as fixed staff.

Strengthen the Leadership of Veterinary Work

Yan Jichang, Livestock Conservation Institute of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the People's Government of Hunan Province, writes: I am a veterinarian. After reading Comrade Aliosha's suggestion on "Strengthening the Leadership of Veterinary Institutions" in the "Reader Letters Summary" column on February 17, I feel that this is indeed a problem that should be solved quickly.

    In our province, in addition to the veterinary institutions set up by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the agricultural technology guidance stations in various counties to uniformly lead the rural livestock conservation work, the veterinary and health work in other aspects such as transportation, urban slaughter, and food companies are all in a state of no leadership, which causes great losses to the work. For example, urban slaughter inspection is managed by the health department, some are managed by the agriculture and forestry department, and some are managed by the industry and commerce and finance departments. As a result, it forms a situation of "everyone manages, and no one manages," and the work has been in a state of chaos. In order to enable veterinarians to fully play their due role in the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, I hope that the central Ministry of Agriculture will quickly contact other relevant departments to jointly study the method of unified leadership of veterinarians.

Railway Business Departments Should Not Miscalculate Freight

Guan Junhan of the Shenyang Wholesale Station of the National Cooperative Federation Second Bureau writes: Railway bureaus and stations in various places often miscalculate freight when handling the consignment of goods. According to our incomplete statistics of the Shenyang Wholesale Station from March to November last year, there were 27 cases of miscalculation of freight for goods sent or transported from various stations, with a total miscalculation amount of more than 17 million yuan, including more than 14 million yuan overcharged and more than 3 million yuan undercharged. According to my understanding, other consignors also frequently find similar situations. Therefore, this is a common and noteworthy issue.

    According to the regulations of the railway: when the railway bureau miscalculates the freight, the arrival station shall handle it, and the overcharged amount shall be refunded and the undercharged amount shall be supplemented. However, consignors are often far away from the arrival station, and it is very inconvenient to handle refund and supplementary procedures, so they cannot clear their accounts in time, resulting in capital backlog, and also increasing many unnecessary difficulties in the work. For example, for the two cars of pesticides sent from Dacheng Station to Changsha North Station in July last year, the railway bureau overcharged 466,200 yuan for freight, and this amount was not refunded from Changsha North Station until the end of September. For the two cars of timber sent from Dunhua to Gaomi on September 18 last year, the overcharged 2.45 million yuan freight was not refunded until late December. Every time we found a miscalculation of freight and negotiated with the arrival station for a refund, we contacted them more than once in writing and even sent special personnel to negotiate.

    I believe that railway business departments should educate their staff to quickly correct their careless style, strengthen their sense of responsibility, actively improve their work, and prevent the phenomenon of miscalculating freight from continuing to occur.

Overcome the Chaotic Phenomenon in Shipping Work

Chai Zuoquan of the Finance and Economic Committee of Xishui County, Hubei Province writes: In December last year, the Shanghai Procurement and Supply Station of China Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company transferred 80 pieces of flannel to our county's Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company. Because the cover was written incorrectly, the batch of cloth was transferred to Echeng County, and it was not discovered until more than a month later. The two batches of cloth transferred to our county by the Hankou Procurement and Supply Station of China Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company on December 6 and 15 last year were actually 20 pieces less than the vouchers. Our county's Lanxi allocation team of Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company has written three letters to inquire, but has not received a reply so far. More strangely, the Lanxi allocation team received 300 pieces of plain cloth from Hankou on January 28 this year, but has not yet seen the shipping documents, and it is not known who the shipper is. The above situation shows that there is still a chaotic phenomenon in the shipping work of the Shanghai and Hankou Cotton, Yarn and Fabric procurement and supply stations. They should quickly check and correct this phenomenon.

Do Not Stockpile Useful "Coal Slurry"

Reader Chi Chun writes: According to my understanding, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has accumulated several thousand tons of "coal slurry." This coal slurry is the residue from the coal used for steelmaking. It is of little use in industrial production, but it is suitable for cooking. The canteen of Beijing No. 23 Middle School burns this coal, proving that its quality is not inferior to ordinary coal briquettes, but the price is much cheaper. Some catering units want to buy this coal slurry to burn, but they cannot buy it. I suggest that the Beijing Coal Construction Company and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant establish a relationship to promote the sales of "coal slurry," which not only enables waste to be utilized, increases national income, but also enables the public to burn coal at a cheaper price.

Cooperatives Should Not Wait for Buyers to Come to the Door

Fu Yinghui of the Finance and Economic Committee of Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province writes: Many farmers in our area use cottonseed cake as the main feed for their cattle to get through the winter. Last winter, farmers in the Dalong Station District of Changde County could not buy cottonseed cake; however, the cooperative had a large backlog of cottonseed cake that it could not sell.

    In early December last year, the Dalong Station District Supply and Marketing Cooperative transferred more than 10,000 catties of cottonseed cake from the county cooperative. The cadres of the cooperative only told a production assistant of the district government, but the farmers did not know that the cooperative had cottonseed cake to sell. Winter has passed, and most of the cottonseed cake is still in the warehouse. On the other hand, local farmers lack cottonseed cake to feed their cattle, and some have to go to places hundreds of miles away to buy it.

    The spring plowing season is approaching. The Dalong Station District Supply and Marketing Cooperative should learn from the lesson of this backlog of cottonseed cake, change the wrong practice of waiting for buyers to come to the door, and earnestly do a good job in the supply of means of production.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    对经营毛猪业务的三点建议
    读者成威军来信：毛猪经营业务，是有关人民日常生活需要的一项重要工作。毛猪是活的商品，管理不善就容易死亡，调运不当就要弄得购销脱节，因此加强经营毛猪的计划性就十分重要。过去某些地区在经营毛猪时，由于缺乏计划和必要的饲养设备，使国家财富遭到了一些损失。为了改进今后工作，我提出下面的三点建议：
    首先，各地食品公司应该摸清毛猪的产销情况，做到有计划地收购、调运和销售。因此，必须依靠各地合作社和收购站对产地的养猪情况作一次调查，使能大致掌握每月的毛猪上市量，以便编订计划时心中有数，而不致有时收购太多造成积压，有时收购太少又造成市场脱销。据我了解，山东某些县依靠收购站和合作社试行卖户登记、定期按序收购的办法，改变了过去收购工作的被动情况，进而保证了计划的执行。这个经验值得各地参考。当然在小农经济的基础上，要求有十分精确的计划是有困难的；但是只要我们积极努力，逐步加强工作的计划性还是可能的。
    其次，目前某些地区饲养毛猪的人力和设备与收购工作的需要相差很远，应该适当加以解决。例如，广州小梅村猪仓只有十六个工人，喂猪槽只有二十几只，猪仓也太小，因此经常出现存猪过多的情况，不但猪仓拥挤不堪，而且有时有的猪仔几天也吃不到食物。上级公司应该重视这些问题，大力协助下面具体地解决人力、设备缺乏的困难，以保证下级公司具有条件来做好工作。
    第三，应该建立包运包养的责任制度。过去毛猪被收购后，往往在途中挨饿受冻、在栏里受挤，上下车船时挨打、挨掼、挨跌，除了有些因而死亡外，其他的猪也都变瘦了。这使国家遭受的损失也是相当惊人的。如去年十二月从河南运往广州的猪，有些在途中竟亏称了二十斤以上。但是，目前还有某些工作人员认为这是“难免”的现象。为了克服这种有害的思想，避免和减少毛猪在运输储存中的亏称现象，必须对饲养员和押运员进行政治教育工作，并严格执行奖惩制度。而在条件具备的地方，还可以开办训练班，传授技术和交流经验，吸收一部分饲养员和押运员成为固定的工作人员。
  加强对兽医工作的领导
    湖南省人民政府农林厅家畜保育所晏纪常来信：我是一个兽医工作者。看了二月十七日“读者来信摘要”栏阿辽沙同志关于“加强对兽医机构的领导”的建议，我感到这确是一个应该迅速解决的问题。
    我省除农林厅及各县农业技术指导站设有兽医机构并统一领导农村家畜保育工作外，其他如交通、城市屠宰及食品公司等方面的兽医卫生工作，都陷于无领导的状态，使工作遭受很大损失。例如城市的屠宰检验，有的属卫生部门管，有的属农林部门管，也有的属工商、财政部门管，结果形成“人人都管，人人都不管”，工作一直处在混乱状态中。为了使兽医在发展农牧生产中充分发挥其应有的作用，希望中央农业部迅速和其他有关部门联系，共同研究兽医统一领导的办法。
  铁路商务部门不应错算运费
    全国合作总社第二局沈阳批发站关浚汉来信：各地铁路局和车站在办理承运货物时，常常发生错算运费的现象。据我们沈阳批发站去年三月到十一月的不完全统计，经各地车站发出或运来的货物，发生错算运费事件二十七件，错算金额共一千七百余万元，其中多算者一千四百余万元，少算者三百余万元。据我了解，其他托运单位也经常发现类似情况。因此，这是一个有普遍性而值得注意的问题。
    根据铁路方面的规定：路局错算运费时由到达站处理，多退少补。而托运单位往往与到达站相距遥远，办理退补手续很不方便，因而就不能及时清理账目，造成资金积压，工作中也增加了很多不应有的困难。例如去年七月自大成站发长沙北站的两车农药，路局多算了运费四十六万六千二百元，此款于九月末才自长沙北站退回。去年九月十八日自敦化发高密木材二车，多算的二百四十五万元运费，到十二月下旬始给退回。我们在每次发现错算运费向到达站交涉退款时，都曾不止一次地用公文联系，甚至派专人进行交涉。
    我认为铁路商务部门应该教育工作人员迅速纠正粗枝大叶的作风，加强工作责任心，积极改进工作，防止错算运费的现象继续发生。
  克服发货工作中的混乱现象
    湖北浠水县财政经济委员会柴作泉来信：去年十二月间，中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站调我县花纱布公司花哔叽八十疋。因为封皮写错了，结果这批布就被调到鄂城县去了，一个多月后才被发觉。中国花纱布公司汉口采购供应站在去年十二月六日和十五日调来我县的两批布，实数都比凭证少了二十疋。我县花纱布公司驻兰溪调拨组曾三次去信查问，至今尚未得到答复。更奇怪的是，兰溪调拨组在今年一月二十八日收到汉口运来的元布三百疋，但迄今未见发货单据送来，发货单位是谁，也无从知道。以上情况，说明上海、汉口的花纱布采购供应站在发货工作中还存在着混乱现象。他们应该迅速检查并纠正这种现象。
  不要积压有用的“洗煤泥”
    读者迟纯来信：据我了解，石景山钢铁厂积存了几千吨“洗煤泥”。这种煤泥是炼钢用煤的剩余物，在工业生产上已没有什么用处，但却适合于烧饭用。北京市第二十三中学伙房烧这种煤，证明它的质量不次于一般煤块或煤球，价格却要便宜许多。有些伙食单位很想买这种煤泥烧，但买不到。我建议北京市煤建公司和石景山钢铁厂建立推销“洗煤泥”的关系，这不但使废物能得到利用，国家增加了收入，而且也使市民群众能烧到价格比较便宜的煤。
  合作社不应该坐等买主上门
    湖南常德专署财政经济委员会傅映辉来信：我地很多农民都用棉饼作为耕牛过冬时的主要食料。去年冬季，常德县大龙站区农民买不到棉饼；但是，合作社却大量积压棉饼卖不出去。
    去年十二月上旬，大龙站区供销合作社从县社调来棉饼一万多斤。该社干部只是和区政府一个生产助理员说了一下，但农民群众都不知道合作社有棉饼卖。冬季过去了，绝大部分棉饼还是放在仓库里。另一方面，当地农民却缺乏棉饼喂牛，有的只好到百里以外的地方去购买。
    春耕季节快到了，大龙站区供销合作社应该接受这次积压棉饼的教训，改变等买主上门的错误做法，认真做好生产资料的供应工作。
