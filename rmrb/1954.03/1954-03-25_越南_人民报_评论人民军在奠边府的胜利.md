Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report on the 22nd, the Vietnamese Labor Party's official newspaper, "People's Daily," recently published an editorial titled "The Vietnamese People's Army Achieves Brilliant Victory at Dien Bien Phu."

The editorial described the significant victories of the Vietnamese People's Army at Dien Bien Phu and in the recent Winter-Spring Campaign. It then analyzed the current military situation. The editorial stated that the current military situation has the following three characteristics: First, the People's Army is tying down a large number of French mobile units in the Northwest of Vietnam, the Central Vietnamese Highlands, the Red River Delta, and South Vietnam, forcing the enemy to disperse their forces and passively respond to the situation; Second, the People's Army units on various battlefields are closely coordinating their operations, and the people's armed forces behind enemy lines are particularly active; Third, the activities of the People's Army on the Vietnamese battlefield are coordinating with the activities of the Lao People's Liberation Army on the Lao battlefield.

The editorial then pointed out that the Vietnamese People's Army's offensive against the French army's fortified strongholds around Dien Bien Phu was the most intense offensive of this Winter-Spring Campaign. This marks the continuous growth of the Vietnamese People's Army, as they have moved from guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare into a new stage: launching large-scale offensives against enemy fortified strongholds.

The editorial continued, stating that the enemy forces currently besieged at Dien Bien Phu account for one-third of the French mobile forces in North Vietnam and one-fifth of the total number of enemy mobile forces in Indochina.

The editorial concluded by saying that the victory of the Vietnamese People's Army at Dien Bien Phu not only dealt a severe blow to the French colonialists and the American interventionists, but also demonstrated that if they continue their war of aggression in Vietnam, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

    越南“人民报”评论人民军在奠边府的胜利
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社二十二日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近发表一篇社论，题目是“越南人民军在奠边府取得辉煌战绩”。
    社论叙述了越南人民军在奠边府和这次冬春战役的重大胜利，接着分析了当前的军事形势。社论说，目前的军事形势有以下三个特点：一、人民军在越南西北、中越南部的高原、红河三角洲和南越牵制着大量的法国机动部队，迫使敌人把兵力分散，被动地应付局势；二、各个战场的人民军部队密切配合作战，敌后人民武装特别活跃；三、人民军在越南战场上的活动与寮国人民解放军在寮国战场上的活动互相配合进行。
    社论接着指出：越南人民军对奠边府周围法军强固据点所发动的进攻，是这次冬春战役中最猛烈的一次进攻。这标志着越南人民军的不断成长，他们已经从游击战与运动战进入一个新的阶段，就是对敌军的强固据点发动大规模的进攻。
    社论继续说，目前被围困在奠边府的敌军占北越法军机动部队的三分之一，占印度支那敌军机动部队总人数的五分之一。
    社论最后说，越南人民军在奠边府取得的胜利不仅给予法国殖民者和美国干涉者以严重打击，同时也说明假如他们继续在越南进行侵略战争，就必将遭到更惨重的失败。
