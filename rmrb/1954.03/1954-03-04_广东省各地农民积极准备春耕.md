Farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province are actively preparing for spring plowing.

The spring plowing season in Guangdong Province starts relatively early. Currently, the majority of areas in Hainan Island have completed the transplanting of early rice. A small number of areas in Central Guangdong, Eastern Guangdong, and Western Guangdong have also begun sowing. The vast majority of other areas in the province will also start spring plowing soon. At present, farmers in various places are actively preparing for spring plowing in order to increase grain production and support national industrial construction.

The spring plowing preparation work in Guangdong this year is being carried out after vigorously promoting the General Line and the new development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement to the farmers. Therefore, it presents many new features different from previous years. This year, farmers in various places have an unprecedentedly high enthusiasm for expanding production. Many farmers have invested all or most of the money from selling surplus grain, after repaying agricultural loans and joining supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, into production, and purchased large quantities of means of production. For example, in Wushan Township, Lingshui County, Hainan Island, over 175 million yuan was earned from selling surplus grain, and over 105.8 million yuan has been invested in production. Preliminary statistics from twelve townships in the second district of Haikang County, Western Guangdong, show that farmers bought back 55 head of cattle, 1,003 pieces of farm tools, and over 146,000 catties of fertilizer after selling grain. In order to increase fertilizer, accumulating soil fertilizer has become a common practice in various places. In areas along rivers, coasts, and with lakes, ponds, and fish ponds, large amounts of river mud, pond mud, sea mud, and oyster shells are being dug up and burned as ash fertilizer during the current period of low water levels. Farmers in the Pearl River Delta are also using *louwei* grass from beaches and weeds from riverbanks as compost. Farmers in mountainous areas are using wild tender grass, leaves, etc., to make fertilizer. As of January 28, various types of soil fertilizer accumulated in the fifteenth district of Jieyang County could be used as spring plowing fertilizer for over 18,000 mu of land.

The construction of water conservancy projects has also entered a climax. More than half of the farmland water conservancy projects planned for the entire province have been completed. As of February 12, Qujiang County had completed 2,457 large and small water conservancy projects, providing sufficient water for the irrigation of over 180,000 mu of land. As a result, over 22,000 mu of single-season land has been transformed into double-season land, and over 4,800 mu of dry land has been transformed into paddy fields.

In order to strengthen the guidance of agricultural production technology, in addition to the provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry centrally training cadres for agricultural production in various places in rotation, agricultural technology guidance stations have been universally established in various counties throughout the province this year, and more cadres have been added to more than 1,600 people, twice as many as last year.

    广东省各地农民积极准备春耕
    广东省春耕季节较早，现在海南岛大部分地区已完成早稻的插秧工作；粤中、粤东、粤西的少数地区也已开始播种；全省其他绝大部分地区也将进行春耕。目前各地农民为了增产更多的粮食支援国家工业建设，正积极进行春耕准备工作。
    今年广东各地的春耕准备工作，是在向农民大张旗鼓地宣传了总路线和互助合作运动有了新的发展的基础上进行的。因此呈现出许多和往年不同的新气象。今年各地农民扩大生产的积极性空前高涨，许多农民把卖余粮的钱，除了还农贷和参加供销合作社、信用合作社外，其余都全部或大部投入生产，购进了大批的生产资料。如海南岛的陵水县武山乡卖余粮款一亿七千五百多万元，已将一亿零五百八十多万元投入生产。粤西区海康县二区十二个乡的初步统计：农民在卖粮后买回的耕牛就有五十五头，农具一千零三件，肥料十四万六千多斤。为了增加肥料，各地积土肥已成一种风气，在沿河、沿海和有湖沼、鱼塘的地区，则利用当前水位较低期间，大量挖取河泥、塘泥、海泥和利用蠔壳等烧作灰肥；在珠江三角洲上的农民更利用海滩的蓢尾草、河边的杂草等作堆肥；山区农民则利用野生的嫩草、树叶等堆制肥料。揭阳县十五区截至一月二十八日止所堆积的各种土肥，可作一万八千多亩的春耕肥料。
    兴修水利工作，目前也已进入高潮。全省计划修建的农田水利工程已完成一半以上，曲江县至二月十二日止已完成大小水利工程二千四百五十七宗，使十八万多亩田得到充分水源的灌溉，因此，使二万二千多亩的单季田变成双季田，四千八百多亩旱田变成水田。
    为了加强农业生产技术的指导，除了由省农林厅集中轮训各地农业生产的干部外，今年全省各县已普遍设立农业技术指导站，并增加干部到一千六百多人，比去年增多一倍。
