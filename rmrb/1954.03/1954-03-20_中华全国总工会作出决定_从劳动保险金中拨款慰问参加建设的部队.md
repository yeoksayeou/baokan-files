Xinhua News Agency, 19th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued instructions to trade unions in various regions and industrial systems, deciding to allocate funds from the labor insurance fund to慰问 the People's Liberation Army troops participating in construction projects.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out in its instructions: At present, many troops participating in construction projects across the country are involved in national construction projects. They have demonstrated the greatest labor enthusiasm in participating in the construction of the Kangzang Highway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and the Huai River harnessing projects. Their achievements are great, and they are good examples for workers nationwide. We should express our慰问 to them. The tasks of the troops participating in construction projects are arduous, and their cultural and material lives are not yet good enough. However, the labor insurance system has been implemented in various industrial systems across the country for more than three years. After several wage adjustments, the cultural and material lives of the workers have been significantly improved. At the same time, the labor insurance funds in various regions and industries still have considerable savings. In order to express our慰问 to the troops participating in the construction of the great motherland, it has been decided to allocate 20 billion yuan from the labor insurance fund to the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission to be transferred to the troops participating in national construction projects as a fund for them to conduct cultural and welfare undertakings. This will not only strengthen the unity between the military and workers, and class unity, and achieve the purpose of class education, but will also have a significant impact on production and construction.

    中华全国总工会作出决定
    从劳动保险金中拨款慰问参加建设的部队
    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国总工会最近向各地区、各产业系统的工会发出指示，决定从劳动保险金中拨款慰问人民解放军参加建设工程部队。
    中华全国总工会在指示中指出：目前全国各地有许多参加建设工程部队参加国家的建设工程，他们在参加修建康藏公路、兰新铁路和宝成铁路、治淮等各项建设工程中，都发挥了最大的劳动热忱。他们的成绩是伟大的，他们是全国工人的好榜样，我们应对他们表示慰问。参加建设工程部队的任务是艰苦的，他们的文化物质生活还不够好。但全国各产业系统实行劳动保险已三年多，经过几度调整工资，职工群众的文化物质生活已有显著提高，同时各地区、各产业的劳动保险金还有相当数目的积蓄。为了对建设伟大祖国的建设工程部队表示慰问，决定从劳动保险金项下拨出二百亿元人民币，请中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部转给参加国家建设工程部队，作为他们举办文化福利事业的基金。这样不仅能够加强军、工团结、阶级团结、达到阶级教育的目的，同时对于生产建设也将会发生重大的作用。
