    Guangxi and Jiangsu Launch Final Batch of Grassroots Elections
    The Revolution's Sacred Land - The Yan'an General Election Movement Fully Unfolds
    The last batch of grassroots elections in Guangxi and Jiangsu provinces is unfolding in over ten thousand grassroots units.

    In Guangxi Province, the general election movement has expanded to the vast border areas. This province has 6,936 townships and towns conducting this final batch of grassroots elections, including the thousand-li-long border line from the Gulf of Tonkin to Mubo County, and the vast rural areas of the 38 counties of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The people of various ethnic groups, including Han, Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Dong, and Hui, as well as overseas Chinese dependents and fishermen, are participating in this election. Before launching this batch of grassroots elections, 3,064 grassroots units in Guangxi Province had completed elections. Among them, the five cities of Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, Wuzhou, and Beihai have basically concluded. In order to ensure that this grassroots election does not hinder spring plowing and production, the Guangxi Provincial Election Committee has requested election committees at all levels to strengthen supervision and inspection, and to arrange the general election and production in a unified manner and closely integrate them.

    There are 9,888 grassroots electoral units in Jiangsu Province. Among them, more than 5,300 units have completed the general election. In the areas where the general election has recently been launched, there are 3,295 units, and more than 1,200 units are about to begin. Since the launch of the general election movement in the province, many activists who emerged in the work of planned grain purchase and grassroots cadres who actively led the mutual aid and cooperation movement have been nominated as candidates for representatives. In Baitu Township, Jurong County, Zhenjiang Special District, among the representative candidates deliberated before the unified purchase of grain, four people were not active in the work of unified purchase of grain, so the voters nominated four other people as representative candidates.

    The general election movement in Yan'an County, the sacred land of our country's revolution, has fully unfolded. More than 80,000 people in the county are welcoming the general election movement with unparalleled excitement.

    The voter lists have been announced in Zaoyuan Township, the former residence of Chairman Mao. On these glorious voter lists are the names of many old neighbors of Chairman Mao when he lived in Zaoyuan. The voter lists also include more than 500 petroleum exploration workers. Most of these exploration workers are People's Liberation Army soldiers who fought in the Northwest battlefield in the past. They came to northern Shaanxi in 1952 to participate in petroleum exploration work. After the start of this general election, they decided to participate in the election locally. The workers all regard it as an honor to be voters in Chairman Mao's second hometown.

    These days, the farmers of Nanniwan Township, Yan'an County, are welcoming this general election with practical actions to step up preparations for spring plowing. While discussing the election work, they are inspecting and replenishing farm tools, and starting to chop firewood, transport manure, and prepare seeds for spring sowing.

    In the general election movement, the residents of the Panlong Town area of ​​Yan'an County recalled the scene when they personally participated in the Panlong Campaign at the beginning of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War in order to strive for the democratic rights of the people of the whole country. Feng Shulin, a propagandist at the Xinshi Township Propaganda Station, told the voters about the old site of Xinshi Township, which was destroyed into rubble by Japanese planes and the Hu Zongnan bandit gang in the past. In the past three years, the local people's government has led the people to vigorously carry out restoration work. Now, two prosperous streets have been restored in the urban area, more than 2,500 new houses have been built, and shops, hospitals, small factories, and bathhouses have been established. After these promotions, the voters have become even more fond of the democratic regime and cherish their right to vote. Now the people of the entire city of Yan'an have elected representatives to form 46 voter qualification review groups, and the election work is being carried out in depth.

    广西、江苏展开最后一批基层选举工作
    革命圣地——延安的普选运动全面展开
    广西和江苏两省最后一批基层选举正在一万多个基层单位中展开。
    广西省的普选运动已扩展到广阔的边疆地带。该省进行最后一批基层选举的有六千九百三十六个乡、镇，包括东京湾到睦边县千余里长的国境线，和桂西僮族自治区三十八个县的广大农村。参加这次普选的有汉、僮、苗、瑶、侗、回等各民族人民和华侨眷属、渔民等。广西省在展开这一批基层选举以前，有三千零六十四个基层单位完成了选举。其中邕宁、柳州、桂林、梧州、北海等五个市已基本结束。为使这次基层选举不妨碍春耕生产，广西省选举委员会要求各地选举委员会加强督促检查，并把普选和生产统一安排，密切结合进行。
    江苏省共有基层选举单位九千八百八十八个。其中有五千三百多个单位完成了普选，在最近展开普选的地区有三千二百九十五个单位，另有一千二百多个单位也即将开始。该省普选运动展开以后，很多在粮食的计划收购工作中涌现出来的积极分子和积极领导互助合作运动的基层干部，被提名为代表候选人。镇江专区句容县白兔乡在统购粮食工作以前酝酿好的代表候选人中，有四个人对于统购粮食工作表现不积极，选民们便另外提名四个人为代表候选人。

    我国革命圣地——延安县的普选运动已全面展开。全县八万多人民都怀着无比兴奋的心情迎接普选运动。
    毛主席的故居——枣园乡，已公布了选民名单。在这些光荣的选民榜上，有毛主席在枣园居住时的许多老邻居的姓名。选民榜上还有五百多名石油钻探工人。这些钻探工人大部是过去转战西北战场的人民解放军战士，他们从一九五二年来到陕北参加石油钻探工作。这次普选开始以后，他们决定在当地参加选举。工人们都以自己能成为毛主席第二故乡的选民而引为荣誉。
    延安县南泥湾乡的农民们这些天来，正以加紧准备春耕的实际行动迎接这次普选。他们一面讨论选举工作，一面检查和添补农具，并开始砍柴、送粪和准备春播籽种。
    在普选运动中，延安县蟠龙镇地区的居民们回忆了第三次国内革命战争开始时，他们为争取全国人民的民主权利而亲身参加蟠龙战役的情景。新市乡宣传站的宣传员冯树林，向选民讲述过去遭受日寇飞机和胡宗南匪帮破坏成一片瓦砾的新市乡市区旧址，在近三年来，当地人民政府领导人民大力进行恢复工作，现在市区内已恢复了两条繁荣的街道，修建了两千五百多间新房，并设立了商店、医院、小工厂和浴室。经过这些宣传，选民们都更加热爱民主政权，珍贵自己的选举权利。现在全延安市的人民已推选出代表组成四十六个选民资格审查小组，选举工作正深入展开。　　　　（新华社）
