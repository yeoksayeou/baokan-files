    Letter
    By our correspondent Chang Gong
    "Are you going back to Guiyang? Or staying in Anshan?"
    Wang Yinwu, a worker from the Guiyang Power Plant who came to support the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, was troubled by this question as soon as he was assigned to the large rolling mill construction team of the Electrical Installation Engineering Company.
    Why was he in such a state of mind right after starting work?
    It turned out that when he arrived in Anshan from Guiyang, he immediately encountered unpleasant things. Anshan had just begun large-scale capital construction, and most of the projects were still in the earthwork and foundation stages. He felt that these were all rough and heavy jobs, with no skills to be learned, and it would be better to work in his original position. In addition, tens of thousands of workers came from all over the country at that time, and new houses could not be built immediately. A room had to accommodate more than a dozen or even dozens of people. He felt that it was not as comfortable as his original job, so he wanted to return to his original place.
    He was not only troubled by the above issues, but more importantly, by his love life. His wife, Zheng Lanfen, was a model worker and model Youth League member at the Guiyang Tobacco Company. She was twenty-one years old, a naive and lovely girl with a round face, big eyes, and two thick braids. They met in the summer of 1951 at the Guiyang Workers' Political Training Class. He was a young man from a working-class background, and his wife was the daughter of a poor peasant. After they met, they were as close as siblings, and after marriage, they became even more affectionate. He left Guiyang for Anshan on the seventh day of his honeymoon. The reason he was able to resolutely leave his wife to participate in the construction of Anshan was because they both had a love for the motherland, and he firmly believed that their separation was only temporary. It wouldn't be long before he could bring his wife to Anshan. Unexpectedly, after he arrived in Anshan, he encountered this unexpected situation. Not to mention seeing each other temporarily, even exchanging letters took a month. Thus, he began to regret leaving Guiyang.
    "But what will happen if I return to Guiyang?" He remembered that when he was transferred from the Guiyang Power Plant to Anshan, the leaders had said to him more than once: "This task is very glorious and very arduous. If you have any concerns, you can raise them, and we will find a way to solve them." He was very happy at the time and firmly said: "As long as I meet the requirements, I have no concerns." When the workers of the whole plant heard that he was going to Anshan, they were very envious and wanted to ask to go to Anshan. Some workers thought that he had just gotten married and kindly wanted to exchange places with him, but he said to these workers: "What does it matter! Even if I get married in the morning and am asked to go at night, it doesn't matter." That night, when he returned home, as soon as he saw his wife, he said: "Little Zheng, I have good news for you. The factory has decided to transfer my job." Little Zheng thought he was joking and said: "No matter how you transfer, you will never leave Guiyang. What's so good about that!" Seeing that Little Zheng didn't believe him, he said seriously: "This time it's far away. Open the map and you will understand. From this corner to that corner, do you know what place it is?" Little Zheng thought for a while and said hesitantly: "Is it the Northeast?" "That's right! It's Anshan in the Northeast. Are you happy?" Little Zheng jumped up with joy. She knew that many people wanted to go but couldn't. Unexpectedly, this glorious thing had fallen on him. How could she not be happy! However, she thought that they had just gotten married a few days ago and would be separated so far, she couldn't help but say: "I really hate to leave so soon." In fact, Wang Yinwu was also reluctant to leave his wife, but when he thought that he was a member of the Youth League and the importance of building Anshan, he explained to Little Zheng: "We are naturally very happy together, but today's separation is for greater happiness in the future, and this separation is only temporary. We will be together soon." Seeing that he had far-sightedness, Little Zheng loved him even more, not only warmly sending him off to Anshan, but also making plans with him to work hard and study hard.
    Thinking about these issues, he really didn't know what to do. Go back to Guiyang! Not to mention that he would be ashamed to face the leaders and all the workers of his original factory, he would even be embarrassed to face his wife! Then, if he didn't return to Guiyang, he would have to stay in Anshan! But considering that he and his wife were so far apart, and according to the situation in Anshan, he couldn't bring her over for a while, what should he do in the long run? He considered these questions for a long time and could not make up his mind. He was embarrassed to speak directly to the Party and the Youth League, but if he didn't speak out, the problem couldn't be solved. As a result, it had a negative impact on his studies and work. He knew that his wife was the most understanding person, so he wrote a detailed letter to his wife, telling her about his thoughts and asking her to give him an idea.
    After he sent the letter, he waited for a reply every day, but a month or two passed without a reply. Just as he was extremely anxious, someone suddenly said to him: "Old Wang, there is a letter for you, from Guiyang." He was overjoyed. As soon as he took it down, he hurriedly opened it. The letter was written like this:
      "I have received every letter you sent, but after reading them, I always feel very sad. Sometimes I can't sleep all night. Mom even thought I was sick!
      "Usually, you always tell me: We are very happy to be born in the Mao Zedong era. We should dedicate everything to the Party and the revolution to defend and create greater happiness. But after you arrived in the most important place in the motherland, you didn't work and study hard, but you were saying in every letter to me that you wanted to come back, wanted to come back. I really don't understand how you could become like this?
    "We are all members of the Youth League and have great ideals. Now is the time for us to work hard and move forward. Why are you actually retreating? I don't know if you remember the hopes of the workers in the whole factory for you? I don't know if you remember the promises we made when we parted? I hope you will think carefully about these questions and examine yourself.
    "I know we are too far apart and you miss me very much. I also miss you very much. But when I think of what you said to me when you left: 'The current separation is for greater happiness in the future.' It gave me great courage and strength. I didn't expect you to not act according to what you said. It's really not right.
    "I know it's very hard for you in Anshan. It's not as comfortable as at home in Guiyang, but compared to the 25,000-li Long March of the Red Army in the past, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, compared to the arduous battles of the Volunteers on the Korean front, it's nothing. You should summon up the courage to fight against these difficulties.
    "Regarding whether you should return to Guiyang or stay in Anshan? I think this question is very simple, that is, we should sacrifice personal interests to obey the interests of the country. Our love is naturally the same. Only when the country is well-built can we have our love. I believe you understand this better than me and you will definitely be able to do it. I hope to see your progress in future letters...."
    After reading this letter, he carefully pondered it and felt that his idea of ​​returning to Guiyang was completely wrong.
    At this time, the construction of Anshan had begun to enter its climax. The construction of the site progressed very quickly, and the installation of new machinery and equipment that had never been seen before had begun. The workers' thinking had also undergone great changes, and they had begun to love Anshan. Take Wang Yinwu himself as an example. Although he often thought about his wife far away in Guiyang, and sometimes wanted to return to his wife's side, as long as he walked into the construction site, saw those great labor scenes, and those model workers who worked selflessly, he didn't think about anything else.
    Once he understood this, he felt very sad. He felt sorry for the Party. He remembered the Party's education to him on weekdays, and the words the branch secretary often said to him at meetings and individual talks: Our revolutionary cause, whether it is war or construction, is equally arduous. Only by overcoming these difficulties can we talk about other things... He felt that his wife loved him very much, but it was no longer an ordinary love, but a love that combined the individual, the Party, and the revolutionary cause. This made him feel even more that his wife was lovely. He also realized that he was wrong not to actively participate in the construction of Anshan and wanting to return to Guiyang. After receiving this letter, he was determined to devote all his strength to the great cause of building Anshan. Soon, he became a shock worker in the engineering team.
    At that time, it was the time when a large number of equipment was being installed in the large rolling mill. He was the mutual aid team leader in a group. He had just received the task of wiring the distribution panel for the No. 2 electromagnetic station and encountered a difficulty: According to the opinions of Soviet experts, each wire end connected to the busbar had to be connected with aluminum connectors, but no one in their entire group knew how to do this work. Only two people in the entire team knew how to do it, which was far from meeting the needs of the project. Seeing this situation, he decided to learn from those two workers. At that time, some people thought that this was not their task and it was specialized work. How could they learn it all at once? He believed that: if you don't learn something, you won't know it. As long as you are determined to learn, there is nothing you can't learn. So he found another mutual aid team leader, Liu Pinze, and went to study together.
    At that time, the two workers were welding aluminum connectors for another electromagnetic station. They saw that the two workers first wrapped the wire ends connected to the busbar with several turns of aluminum wire, inserted them into a pre-cast aluminum connector, and then used a gasoline stove to heat the joint to fuse the two together. They felt that this work was not difficult, so they ran back to experiment, but they tried three in a row, and each welded area had honeycomb holes and the quality was very poor. They were not discouraged and continued to study the reasons for the poor quality. They found that it was not that the welding method was wrong, but that the temperature was not well controlled: some were over-burned and some were not burned long enough. When they experimented with the fourth one, they paid special attention to controlling the temperature, and as a result, this one reached the first-class quality. After their successful experiment, the team leader organized all the workers in the group to weld aluminum connectors. In just one night, they completed all the more than one hundred and sixty wire ends connected to the busbar, from welding aluminum connectors to connecting to the distribution panel, creating a new record on the entire construction site.
    In September of last year, he was promoted to the deputy leader of an electrical installation team. One night, while he was leading the team to install the accident conversion panel and the work lighting panel for the main electrical room of the large rolling mill, Ai Ziliang, the section chief of the No. 1 electromagnetic station, ran to him and said: "Old Wang, please help us." Seeing that Ai Ziliang looked very anxious, he hurriedly asked: "What's the matter?" Ai Ziliang told him: The No. 1 electromagnetic station will be powered on at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, and it's already past 12 o'clock, and only half of it has been completed. Wang Yinwu heard that this task was very important and saw that their own task was almost completed, so he said: "Okay, we will go right away." He took a few workers and went to the No. 1 electromagnetic station. Only then did he discover that it wasn't just half of the job left as Ai Ziliang had said. A large portion of the aluminum connectors had not yet been welded, and the quality of those that had been welded was not good, and they had to be re-welded. He led the workers to start from scratch. When this task was completed, the sun had just risen from the east.
    Soon, he was promoted from a sixth-grade worker to a fourth-grade worker; from deputy team leader to full team leader. What made him most unforgettable was that on the eve of the start of production of the large rolling mill, he was also approved to become a glorious Communist Party member. It was also at this time that he wrote a long letter with incomparable joy and sent it to the southwest corner of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    “回贵阳呢？还是在鞍山？”
    从贵阳市发电厂前来支援鞍山钢铁公司建设的工人王荫吾，刚刚分配到电气安装工程公司大型轧钢厂工程队，就为着这个问题苦恼起来。
    为什么他刚刚开始工作就这样呢？
    原来他从贵阳到达鞍山，一开始就遇到了不如意的事情。鞍山刚开始大规模基本建设，大部分工程都还在挖土方和打基础。他认为这都是些粗活重活，没有什么技术可学，不如在原来的工作岗位上工作的好；加上当时从各地来了几万工人，新的房子一下盖不起来，一间房子要住十几个，甚至几十个人，他觉得不如在原来的工作岗位上舒服，因而就想回到原来的地方去。
    他苦恼的还不仅仅是以上的问题，更重要的是他的爱人问题。他的爱人郑兰芬是贵阳市烟草公司的模范女工和模范团员，今年二十一岁，是个天真可爱的姑娘，圆圆的脸庞，大大的眼睛，梳着两条又粗又大的辫子。他俩是在一九五一年的夏天，在贵阳市工人政治训练班里认识的。他是工人出身的小伙子，他爱人是贫雇农的女儿，他俩认识以后，就像兄妹一样的亲热，结婚以后，当然更加热爱了。他从贵阳到鞍山来的时候，正是他新婚后的第七天；他所以能够毅然的和他爱人分别，前来参加鞍山的建设，就是因为他俩都有着热爱祖国的心，并且他自己也坚决地相信，他俩的这种分别只是暂时的，用不了多长的时间，他就可以把他的爱人接到鞍山来。不料他来到了鞍山以后，却遇到了这种想像不到的情况，别说一时不可能见面，就是相互通一次信，也得一个月的时间。这样，他就开始懊悔不该离开贵阳了。
    “可是回到贵阳将会怎样呢？”他想起他从贵阳发电厂调往鞍山的时候，领导同志曾经不止一次的对他这样说：“这个任务是很光荣的，也是很艰巨的，你有什么顾虑可以提出来，我们好想法解决。”他当时心里非常高兴，就坚决地说：“只要我够条件，什么顾虑也没有。”全厂的工人听说他要去鞍山，非常羡慕，也都想要求去鞍山。有些工人认为他刚刚结婚，就好心地跑去想和他调换一下，可是他却对这些工人说：“这有什么关系呢！就是早上结婚，夜间叫我去，也没啥。”那天晚上他回到家里，一看见他爱人就说：“小郑，告诉你一个好消息，厂里决定调动我的工作了。”小郑以为他开玩笑，就说：“调来调去总出不了贵阳，算什么好消息！”他看小郑不相信，就很认真地说：“这回可远了，打开地图一看，你就明白了，从这个角到那个角，你知道是什么地方？”小郑想了一想，就半信半疑地说：“是东北吗？”“对！是上东北的鞍山，你高兴吗？”小郑高兴得跳起来，她知道多少人想去都去不上，不料这光荣的事情却叫他摊到了，她怎能不高兴呢！可是，她想到刚刚结婚几天，就分开这么远，就不由得说：“我真是舍不得这么快就离开。”事实上，王荫吾也是舍不得离开他的爱人的，但是他一想到自己是个青年团员，一想到建设鞍山的重要，就向小郑解释道：“我们在一起自然是很幸福的，但是今天的分离，是为了今后更大的幸福，何况这个分离又是暂时的，不久我们就可以在一起了。”小郑看他看得很远，也就越发爱他了，不仅热烈地欢送他去鞍山，而且还和他订了努力工作和努力学习的计划。
    他想到这些问题以后，真不知如何是好。回贵阳吧！别说没有脸去见他原来厂的领导同志和全体工人们，就是连他的爱人也不好意思啊！那么，不回贵阳就只有留在鞍山了！可是他考虑到他和他爱人离得那么远，根据鞍山的情况，一时又不能把她接来，时间长了，又该怎么办呢？这些问题他考虑了很久，始终拿不定主意。他不好意思直接向党、团来讲，而不讲出来问题又不能求得解决。结果，对他的学习和工作都发生了不好的影响。他知道他的爱人是最理解他的人，于是就把自己的这种思想详详细细地写信告诉了他的爱人，叫他爱人给出一个主意。
    从他发信以后，就整天盼望着来信，可是一连过了一两个月，还没有见到回信。正在万分焦急的时候，忽然有人对他说：“老王，有你的一封信，是从贵阳来的。”他高兴极了，一拿下来，就急忙拆开来看。那封信是这样写的：
      “你的每一封来信都收到了，可是我看了以后总感到非常难过，有时我整夜睡不着觉，妈妈还以为我生病了呢！
      “平时间，你总对我说：我们生长在毛泽东时代是很幸福的，我们该把一切都献给党，献给革命，来保卫和创造更大的幸福。可是你到了祖国最重要的地方以后，不好好地工作和学习，却在给我的每一封信里都说着想回来，想回来。我真是不理解你怎么会变成这样了呢？
    “我们都是青年团员，都有着伟大的理想，现在正是我们努力前进的时候，你为什么竟然往后退呢？我不知你记得不记得全厂工人对你的希望？我也不知道你记得不记得我们分别时的诺言？我希望你好好地想一想这些问题，检查检查自己。
    “我知道我们离得是太远了，你是很想念我的，我也同样很想念你。但我一想你临走时跟我讲的话：‘现在的分离，就是为了将来更大的幸福。’也就给了我很大的勇气和力量，我却未想到你竟没有按着你所说的话去作，真是不应该。
    “我知道你在鞍山是很艰苦的，不如在咱们贵阳家里舒服，可是这些艰苦，比起过去红军的二万五千里长征，爬雪山，过草地；比起志愿军在朝鲜前线的艰苦作战，那就不算什么了。你应该鼓起勇气来与这些困难进行斗争。
    “关于你回贵阳还是留在鞍山？我觉得这个问题很简单，那就是应该牺牲个人的利益来服从国家的利益，我们的爱情自然也是这样，只有把国家建设好了，才会有我们的爱情，我相信你是比我明白的，并且也一定能够这样作，我希望在以后信中，能看出你的进步来……。”
    他读了这封信后仔细一琢磨就觉得他那种回贵阳的思想是完全不对头的了。
    这时鞍山的建设已开始进入高潮了。工地上的工程进展得很快，已经开始安装从来也没有见过的新式机器设备了。工人们的思想也起了很大的变化，已经开始爱上了鞍山。就拿王荫吾自己来说吧，虽然他经常惦念着远在贵阳的爱人，有时还想回到他爱人的身边去，但是，只要他走进工地，看到了那些伟大的劳动场面和那些忘我劳动的模范工人，就什么也不想了。
    事情一想通，心里很难过，他感到自己对不起党。他想起平日党对他的教育，想起支部书记经常在会上和个别谈话时同他讲的话：咱们革命事业，不论是战争或者是建设，同样都是艰苦的。只有克服了这些艰苦，才能谈到其他……他觉得他爱人是很爱他的，不过已经不是一般的爱了，而是把个人、党和革命事业结合起来的一种爱。这一来，他就越发感到他的爱人可爱了。他也就更认识到他不积极地参加鞍山建设，想回贵阳去的不对了。他从接到这封信后，就决心把自己的一切力量，都投到建设鞍山的伟大事业中去。不久，就成为工程队里的一个突击手。
    那时正是大型轧钢厂大量安装设备的时候，他是一个小组里的互助组长，刚刚接到了给二号电磁站配电盘接线的任务，就遇到了一个困难：根据苏联专家的意见，每一个往母线上接线的线头，都要用铝接头，但是他们全组没有一个人会干这个活，全队也只有两个人会干，远远地赶不上工程的需要。他看到这种情形，就决定向那两个工人去学习。当时有些人认为这不是自己的任务，又是专门活，怎能一下学会呢？他却认为：什么东西不学就不会，只要有决心学，没有学不会的。于是他找了另一个互助组长刘品泽，一起去学习去了。
    当时那两个工人正在给另一个电磁站焊铝接头。他们见到那两个工人先把往母线上接的线头，用铝线缠上好几圈，插进一个已经铸好的铝接头里，然后再用汽油炉子把接头的地方烧一下，使两者熔在一起。他们觉得这个活并不算难，就跑回去试验，但一连试了三个，每一个焊接的地方都有蜂窝，质量很坏。他们并不灰心，继续研究质量不好的原因，发现不是焊接方法不对，而是温度没有掌握好：有的是烧过火了，有的是烧的时间不够。他们在试验第四个的时候，就特别注意掌握温度，结果这一个便达到了头等质量。经过他们试验成功后，组长就组织了全组工人来焊铝接头，只是一夜的工夫，他们便把一百六十多根往母线上接的线头，从焊铝接头直到接到配电盘上全部完成了，创造了全工地上的新纪录。
    去年九月间，他被提升为电气安装的一个小组的副组长。有一天夜间，他正领导着小组给大型轧钢厂主电室安装事故转换盘与工作照明盘的时候，一号电磁站的工段主任艾子良跑来对他说：“老王，你帮帮我们的忙吧。”他看艾子良的样子很着急，就忙问：“什么事？”艾子良告诉他：一号电磁站明天早上八时通电，现在已经十二点多钟了，只完成了一半。王荫吾听说这个任务很重要，又看他们自己的任务快完了，就说：“好吧，我们马上就去。”他带了几个工人，到一号电磁站一看，才发现并不是像艾子良所说的只剩下一半，光铝接头就还有一大半没有焊，已经焊了的质量还不好，还得要从新焊。他就领着工人们从头干起，当这个任务完成的时候，太阳刚刚从东方出来。
    不久，他就由六级工人被提升为四级工人；由副组长被提升为正组长。最使他难忘的是，在大型轧钢厂开工生产的前夕，又被批准成为一个光荣的共产党员。也就在这个时候，他怀着无比愉快的心情，写了一封长长的信，寄到祖国的西南角上去了。（附图片）
