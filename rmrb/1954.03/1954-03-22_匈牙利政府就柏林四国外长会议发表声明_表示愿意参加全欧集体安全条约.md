Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 21st: The government of the Hungarian People's Republic issued a statement on the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting on the 20th. The statement said: The government of the Hungarian People's Republic attaches great importance to the Berlin Conference because it clarified several international issues, made it possible to resolve international disputes through negotiation, and opened the way for a meeting of representatives of the five major powers with representatives of other countries.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. government and the British and French governments, which follow U.S. policy, did not abandon their plans to rearm West Germany at the Berlin Conference. The U.S. ruling clique is intensifying its pressure on Western European countries to quickly ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty, and is in fact taking a position that contradicts the fundamental interests of consolidating peace and European security. The peace-loving Hungarian people, who suffered four hundred years of occupation by foreign oppressors, twice suffered the horrors and destruction of war at the hands of German imperialism in one generation. Therefore, together with the people of other European countries, they oppose plans aimed at restoring German militarism, because the resurgence of German militarism is a serious threat to the achievements of the Hungarian people's peaceful construction labor. The resurgence of German militarism is inseparable from new plans for the annexation of Germany and Austria, and once the annexation of Germany and Austria is realized, it will pose a direct threat to the independence and security of Hungary by German militarist aggressors.

The statement said: The so-called "European Defense Community" plan is a plan for a group of European countries to confront other European countries, while one of the most important conditions for maintaining peace is for the people of European countries to unite for the purpose of achieving peace. Therefore, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that the people of European countries, including the Hungarian people, are deeply concerned with the establishment of a European collective security system that includes all European countries. Within this European collective security system, it will be possible to collectively and effectively guarantee the sovereignty of European countries and protect participating countries from any possible aggression.

The Soviet delegation's proposal at the Berlin Conference to conclude a pan-European collective security treaty can effectively guarantee the establishment of a European collective security system. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic hopes to actively participate in efforts to ease international tensions and ensure lasting peace. Therefore, it supports the Soviet proposal to conclude a pan-European collective security treaty, because this proposal can also enable the Hungarian People's Republic, as an equal member, to actively participate with all European countries, large and small, in intensified and expanded international cooperation. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that the Soviet proposal provides a practical guarantee against the revival of German militarism and any other new aggressive conspiracies in Western Europe. This proposal is in line with the heartfelt wishes of the people of European countries (including the Hungarian people) and the desire to consolidate world peace. Therefore, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic firmly believes that it is possible to include all European countries in the collective security system on the basis of the Soviet proposal.

The statement concluded: In view of the fact that the conclusion of a pan-European collective security treaty can greatly promote broad international cooperation and create the most important prerequisites for ensuring lasting peace, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic hereby declares that it is willing to participate in the pan-European collective security treaty and is willing to take steps jointly with other European countries to conclude this treaty as soon as possible.

    匈牙利政府就柏林四国外长会议发表声明
    表示愿意参加全欧集体安全条约
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：二十日，匈牙利人民共和国政府发表关于柏林四国外长会议的声明。声明说：匈牙利人民共和国政府十分重视柏林会议，因为它澄清了几个国际问题，使得有可能以协商方式解决国际争端，并为五大国代表会同其他国家代表举行会议打开了道路。
    声明指出，美国政府和追随美国政策的英法两国政府在柏林会议上并没有放弃重新武装西德的计划。美国统治集团加紧压迫西欧各国从速批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，事实上采取着与巩固和平及欧洲安全的基本利益相矛盾的立场。爱好和平的匈牙利人民曾经身受外国压迫者四百年的占领，在一代之中德国帝国主义曾经使他们两度遭到战争的恐怖和破坏。因此，他们跟欧洲其他国家人民一起反对以恢复德国军国主义为目的的计划，因为德国军国主义的再起就是对匈牙利人民和平建设劳动的成就的严重威胁。德国军国主义的再起和新的德奥合并计划是分不开的，而一旦德奥合并实现，就造成德国军国主义侵略者对匈牙利的独立和安全的直接威胁。
    声明说：所谓“欧洲防务集团”计划，就是以一批欧洲国家的集团对付另一些欧洲国家，而维持和平的最重要的条件之一却是为了实现和平的目的，欧洲各国人民团结起来。因此，匈牙利人民共和国政府认为，欧洲各国人民、包括匈牙利人民在内，和建立一个包括欧洲所有国家的欧洲集体安全体系，是有切身关系的。在这个欧洲集体安全体系范围内，将有可能集体地和有效地保障欧洲国家的主权和保护参与国不受任何可能的侵略。
    苏联代表团在柏林会议上提出的缔结全欧集体安全条约的建议，可以有效地保证建立欧洲集体安全体系。匈牙利人民共和国政府希望积极参加缓和国际紧张局势和保证巩固的和平的努力，因而，它拥护苏联的缔结全欧集体安全条约的建议，因为这个建议也可以使得匈牙利人民共和国有可能以平等的一员，和欧洲各大小国家积极参与加紧扩展的国际合作。匈牙利人民共和国政府认为，苏联的建议提供了防止德国军国主义复活和西欧任何其他新侵略阴谋的实际保证，这个建议符合欧洲各国人民
  （包括匈牙利人民）的衷心愿望和巩固世界和平的愿望。因此，匈牙利人民共和国政府坚信，在苏联建议的基础上是有可能把一切欧洲国家都包括在集体安全体系以内的。
    声明最后说：鉴于缔结全欧集体安全条约就可以在很大程度上促进广泛的国际合作和造成保障巩固的和平的最重要前提，匈牙利人民共和国政府兹特声明：它愿意参加全欧集体安全条约，并愿为尽速缔结这个条约而与其他欧洲国家共同采取步骤。
