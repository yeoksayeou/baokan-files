    Large Inland River Passenger Ship Manufactured by Jiangnan Shipyard Nears Completion
   [This News Agency] Shanghai workers have used domestically produced materials to build the first large passenger ship, which has completed its land-based construction and is about to hold a launching ceremony, after which construction will continue.
    This passenger ship was designed by the jointly-owned public-private Minsheng Shipping Company and built by Jiangnan Shipyard. All the materials used (the main materials of the ship are steel plates and angle iron) were supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The passenger ship has four decks of cabins with nine hundred and seventy-four berths and can simultaneously carry three hundred and fifty metric tons of cargo.
    This passenger ship is mainly for transporting passengers, so the cabin arrangement strives for safety and comfort. Many facilities are also more complete than ordinary passenger ships, with dining rooms, shower rooms, barber shops, broadcasting rooms, libraries and health rooms, and adequate ventilation equipment. To ensure that guests traveling long distances can eat fresh vegetables and meat, there is a cold storage room on board. The floor of the dining room is paved with linoleum tiles, which can be used by passengers for dancing. All of these, whether passengers are in first class or third class, can enjoy.
    The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are shallow and the current is rapid, especially between Yichang and Chongqing, where there is the danger of the "Three Gorges", with many dangerous shoals and hidden reefs. Ordinary downstream ships can only reach Hankou or Yichang and cannot enter Sichuan. This passenger ship has a shallow draft and can reach Chongqing directly; and it is fast, even when floods are flowing down, it can go upstream.
    The ship's controls and power equipment are electric-hydraulic, the latest type of passenger ship. In terms of manufacturing, more than 95% of the hull is welded by electric welding, so the hull is light and strong. To ensure passenger safety, the passenger ship has double bottom protection.

    江南造船厂制造的内河大客轮快要完工
   【本报讯】上海工人用我国国产材料制造的第一艘大客轮，已经完成陆地工程，就快要举行下水典礼了，下水后再继续施工。
    这艘客轮由公私合营民生轮船公司设计，江南造船厂建造，所用的材料（船的主要材料是钢板和角铁）全部是由鞍山钢铁公司供给的。客轮有四层舱房，设有九百七十四个舱位（睡铺），并可以同时载运三百五十公吨货物。
    这艘客轮是以运送旅客为主，所以舱位安排，力求安全舒适。许多设备，也比一般客轮齐全，有餐室、淋浴室、理发室、广播室、图书室和保健室，有充分的通风设备。为保证长途旅行的客人能吃到新鲜的蔬菜、肉类，船上设有冷藏间。餐室的地板是用油毛砖铺设的，可供旅客跳舞。所有这些，无论是乘一等或乘三等舱的旅客都能享受到。
    长江中上游水浅流急，特别在宜昌重庆之间，有“三峡”之险，险滩暗礁很多，一般下江轮船只能上达汉口或宜昌而不能入川。这艘客轮吃水浅，可以直达重庆；并且航速快，就是在洪水下泻时，也能溯流而上。
    客轮的操纵器和动力等机械设备，是电力油压式样，是目前客轮中最新的型式。在制造上，船身有百分之九十五以上是用电焊焊接，因之船身轻巧而且坚固。为保证旅客安全，客轮并有双层底保护。
