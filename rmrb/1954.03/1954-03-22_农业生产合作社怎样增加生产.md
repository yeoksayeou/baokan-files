How Can Agricultural Production Cooperatives Increase Production
　　Yan Ling

Our main purpose in establishing agricultural production cooperatives is to increase production; the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives are also reflected in their ability to increase production. The most important thing to look at when judging whether a cooperative is run well is whether its production has increased. After setting up agricultural production cooperatives, there are many good conditions for increasing production; however, only by very well and actively utilizing these conditions can we be sure that production will increase. We must know that when the cooperative's production increases and the income of the members increases, everyone sees that the prosperity of the cooperative is their own happiness, and only then can the cooperative be further consolidated and developed. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives must fully and appropriately utilize all their good conditions to bring out their advantages in production.

How can we use the superior conditions of agricultural production cooperatives to increase production? In addition to correctly organizing the labor force, the most important things are to carry out agricultural capital construction and production reform work; in addition, we can also use surplus labor and financial resources to operate some sideline businesses that can be developed and are helpful to agricultural production.

Do a Good Job in Agricultural Capital Construction
Agricultural capital construction mainly refers to the following things: building water conservancy projects to turn dry land into paddy fields; improving soil to turn bad land into good land; changing the terrain to turn sloping land and uneven land into terraces and flat land; building livestock pens, pig and sheep pens, and toilets to prevent fertilizer from being lost and to ensure the safety of livestock; replacing old farm tools with new farm tools; replacing small livestock with large livestock; planting trees and forests; increasing the number of breeding stock, and so on. These things lay the foundation for increasing production, so they are called capital construction. These things are difficult for individual farmers to do, and some of them are not easy for mutual aid teams to do. In agricultural production cooperatives, land is managed in a unified way, labor can be used more rationally, and financial resources are also greater, so it is easier to do these things. Doing these things well can greatly increase production and enhance the ability to resist disasters, as proven by the facts of many agricultural production cooperatives.

After organizing agricultural production cooperatives, there is a surplus of labor; after initially improving production, there is also a surplus of production funds. Where should this labor and capital be used? The best way out is agricultural capital construction. Putting these forces into agricultural capital construction may not be as "profitable" as running certain sideline businesses and commerce; however, we must know that doing so lays the foundation for long-term and continuous increase in production, and this way of increasing income is more reliable. Sideline businesses that are beneficial to agricultural production can of course also be done; however, agricultural production cooperatives should first consider agricultural production. As for running commerce, that is exploiting people, and agricultural production cooperatives should not do it at all. Using surplus labor and financial resources in agricultural capital construction and laying a solid foundation for agricultural production increase can truly turn agricultural production cooperatives into "treasure troves" and sources of happy life for farmers.

To do a good job in agricultural capital construction, it must be carried out according to a certain plan. Where to start, what to build first, and what to build later must be comprehensively planned. What should be considered when making such plans? First, it is necessary to see what things the cooperative urgently needs to do and how much strength it has to do how much. As long as it is needed and can be done, it should be done as much as possible, combining current interests with long-term interests; on the other hand, if too much manpower, material resources, and financial resources are used for capital construction, delaying daily agricultural production work, or even stopping work halfway because it cannot be continued, or having to borrow too much money, are not good. Second, it is necessary to look at the technical conditions of the cooperative and pay attention to learning the technology related to capital construction. For example, in building water conservancy projects, it is best to have experienced people to guide. If there is no experience, then learn. If there are no people who understand the technology to guide, and you do not study, and you start construction rashly, it may not work, and even if a big flood comes, it will collapse again, which will be a great waste. Third, it is necessary to see which ones are more likely to have results and cost less money. If it costs a lot of money and it is difficult to see results in three or two years, it can be postponed; if it costs less money or can be effective in two or three years, it can be done first. Fourth, it is necessary to see which ones are most needed for production. For those that are closely related to increasing production, such as planting trees and forests, although it is not easy to profit in a few years, it should be done as early as possible; some constructions that are not closely related to increasing production should be postponed. In the past, some cooperatives regarded capital construction as just building houses, and were eager to build offices and clubs, and built the houses for raising livestock too exquisitely. These things that are not closely related to increasing production are best done after production has increased a lot and the lives of the members have improved to a certain extent. Fifth, it is necessary to take into account the interests of national construction and the interests of farmers outside the cooperative, and cooperate with national construction, and cooperate with the requirements of other cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers. For example, when building canals and repairing beaches, we cannot only take care of the interests of our own cooperative and harm the interests of national construction and other farmers. If everyone does not cooperate with each other, it will also be harmful to their own cooperative. In some places, when repairing beaches, one cooperative repaired it on the east bank of the river, and the other cooperative repaired it on the west bank of the river, which made the river channel crooked. If the water is a little big, it will wash away the land. Planting trees and forests and reclaiming wasteland must take into account the interests of animal husbandry.

Do a Good Job in Agricultural Production Reform
The agricultural production reform mentioned here mainly refers to the following things: reforming farming techniques, such as deep plowing, close planting, rational fertilization, rational irrigation, planting according to local conditions, etc.; reforming farming systems, such as implementing crop rotation, etc.; improving varieties, such as field seed selection, emasculation and hybridization, etc.; preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, such as seed soaking and mixing, chemical insecticide, etc. These things are what our farmers have not done or have not done well enough in the past; replacing the not very good methods of the past with good methods in agricultural production, and using the good methods that have not been used in the past, is called agricultural production reform. Most of these things are difficult for individual farmers to do because of their weak manpower and material resources, fragmented land, and conservative thinking. Agricultural production cooperatives have better conditions, such as having larger livestock and newer farm tools, so they can deep plow; unified use of land makes it easy to rationally use fertilizer and water conservancy, and also makes it easy to plant suitable crops according to different soil types and terrains, and also makes it easy to experiment with improving technology and to select and retain good seeds. Doing these things well can also greatly increase production, and can more effectively fight against disasters and reduce losses. Agricultural production cooperatives should fully utilize their favorable conditions to do these things well.

In agricultural production reform, there are several points that should be noted: First, it must be suitable for the specific conditions of the local area and the cooperative. The climate, soil quality, and crop habits of various places are different, so the specific methods of production reform are also different; the experience of other places can and should be learned, but it must be compared with the conditions of the local cooperative to make it suitable for the conditions of the local cooperative, and it cannot be copied indiscriminately. Second, it is necessary to attach importance to the original good production increase experience in the local area. There are some veterans and experts in growing crops in various places, and their experience has been accumulated over many years, which is very valuable; they have increased production, but they may not be very clear about the reason. The way they grow land should be carefully compared with the general way of growing land to find out the reason for the increase in production. The cooperative should pay attention to rewarding members with good technology. Third, it is necessary to improve step by step. Using new methods too quickly, because there is no experience, is easy to go wrong and suffer losses; only taking the methods of the older generation as treasures and not daring to change at all, not daring to move forward, and not learning new science and technology, the cooperative's production increase will be limited and cannot be greatly improved. Fourth, like agricultural capital construction, it is also necessary to pay attention to calculating costs and adopt methods of reforming that cost less money and have greater results.

Do a Good Job in Sideline Production
The sideline production in general rural areas mainly refers to the following things: handicrafts, such as weaving bamboo utensils, burning charcoal, opening flour mills, squeezing oil, burning lime, making paper, etc.; animal husbandry, such as feeding pigs, sheep, dairy cows, chickens, ducks, etc.; horticulture, such as cultivating fruit trees, vegetables, etc.; fisheries, such as raising fish, catching fish and shrimp, etc.; transportation, such as driving carts, carrying burdens, paddling boats, etc.; logging, such as cutting firewood, collecting herbs, etc. In short, any production undertaking operated by farmers who mainly engage in agriculture can be called a sideline. However, one thing that should be clarified is that these things should be mainly done with the labor of the members themselves; if they are mainly used to make money, then it becomes commerce, which becomes exploitation, and agricultural production cooperatives should not do it.

Doing a good job in sideline production can add to and expand the funds for agricultural production; sideline businesses such as breeding and afforestation can accumulate fertilizer and conserve water and soil, which are directly beneficial to agricultural production; in addition, it can also increase the income of members and improve their lives. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives can appropriately operate some sideline businesses according to their own conditions. Because agricultural production cooperatives can have more surplus labor and financial resources, they can also show their superiority in operating sideline businesses, which is also an aspect of fully utilizing the good conditions of agricultural production cooperatives.

In sideline production, there are some things to pay attention to: First, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of developing agriculture as the main focus, and at no time should it hinder agricultural production. In the past, some cooperatives were greedy for "immediate profits" and operated too many sideline businesses, claiming to have "eight major enterprises" and "four major workshops," neglecting their main business and dispersing their strength. As a result, agricultural production decreased, and the profits from sideline businesses were not as much as the losses in agriculture, "grasping sesame seeds and losing the watermelon." Some also blindly operated sideline businesses, but lost money instead. Everyone must not miscalculate. Second, sideline production must serve agricultural production. The income from sideline businesses should be used as much as possible to expand agricultural production; when choosing sideline businesses, choose those that are beneficial to agricultural production as much as possible. Third, when operating sideline businesses, especially handicrafts, be sure to inquire about whether there is a market; it is best to sign a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative first. Fourth, when developing sideline businesses, especially animal husbandry, pay attention to the technical conditions of the local area and the cooperative to avoid accidents such as large-scale deaths of livestock due to epidemics, resulting in losses. Fifth, sideline businesses that are suitable for each household to do separately should not be forced to operate collectively. Of course, members should also pay attention not to delay the cooperative's agricultural production because they are greedy for sideline businesses.

    农业生产合作社怎样增加生产
    燕凌
    我们办农业生产合作社的主要目的，就是增加生产；农业生产合作社的好处，也就表现在它能够增加生产。看一个社办得好不好，顶重要的就是看它的生产是不是增加了。办起了农业生产合作社，就有了许多增加生产的好条件；可是，只有很好地积极地利用了这些条件，才敢说一定能增加生产。要知道，社里的生产增加了，社员们的收入增加了，大家都看到社的兴旺就是自己的幸福，社才能更加巩固和发展。因此，农业生产合作社一定要充分地恰当地利用本身所有的好条件，把优越性在生产中间发挥出来。
    怎样利用农业生产合作社的优越条件来增加生产呢？除了正确地组织劳动力以外，最要紧的事就是进行农业基本建设和生产改革工作；此外，还可以利用多余的劳动力和财力经营一些可能发展的、对农业生产有帮助的副业。
    做好农业基本建设工作
    农业基本建设，主要是指这样一些事情：兴修水利，把旱地变成水地；改良土壤，把坏地变成好地；改变地形，把斜坡地、凸凹地变成梯田、平地；修牲口圈、猪羊圈、厕所，使肥料不至于散失，使牲畜能够安全；旧农具换新农具；小牲口换大牲口；植树造林；增加母畜等等。这些事情都是为增加生产打基础、打底子的，所以叫做基本建设。这些事情，在单干户是很难办到的，其中有一些事互助组也不容易办。在农业生产合作社，土地统一经营了，劳动力能更合理地使用了，财力也大了，要办这些事情就比较好办了。这些事情办好了，就能大大增加生产，就能增强抵抗灾害的能力，这是很多农业生产合作社的事实都证明了的。
    组织起来农业生产合作社以后，劳动力有了剩余；初步提高了生产以后，生产资金也有了剩余。这些劳动力和资金该用在什么地方呢？最好的出路就是农业基本建设。把这些力量放在农业基本建设上，也许不像经营某些副业和商业那样“得利”快；可是，要知道，这样做就为长期的不断地增加生产打下了底子，这样增加收入是更牢靠的。对农业生产有益的副业，当然也可以做；可是，农业生产合作社首先要考虑的应该是农业生产。至于经营商业，那是剥削人的事，农业生产合作社根本不应该去干。把多余的人力、财力用在农业基本建设方面，把农业增产的基础打得结结实实的，才真正能把农业生产合作社变成“聚宝盆”，变成农民的幸福生活的泉源。
    农业基本建设要做得好，必须按一定的计划进行。从那里着手，先建设什么，后建设什么，都要作通盘的打算。在作这样的打算的时候，应当考虑些什么呢？第一，要看合作社急需要办那些事情，本身有多大力量，能办多大事情。只要是需要的、能办的，就应该尽力办，把当前利益和长远利益结合起来；另一方面，如果为了基本建设，把过多的人力、物力、财力用在这上面，误了日常的农业生产工作，甚至干到半截干不下去不得不停工，或者要贷过多的款，都是不好的。第二，要看合作社的技术条件，要注意学习和基本建设有关的技术。比如修水利，最好有有经验的人来指导，如果没有经验，就要学。如果没有懂得技术的人来指导，也不学习，冒冒失失动工，修起来也许不管用，甚至大水一来又冲垮了，就都会成为很大的浪费。第三，要看那一些比较容易发生效果而且花钱比较少。如果花钱很多，而且三年两年还难以见效，就可以缓办；如果花钱较少，或者两三年内就可以见效，就可以先办。第四，要看那一些是生产上最需要的。对于增加生产有密切关系的，像植树造林，虽然几年内不容易得利，也应该尽可能早办；有些建设和增加生产没有密切的关系，就应该缓办。过去有的社把基本建设当成只是修房盖屋，急于建筑办公室、俱乐部，把养牲口的房子盖得过于讲究，这些和增加生产关系不大的事，最好还是到将来生产增加很多了、社员生活都改善到一定程度了以后再办。第五，要照顾到国家建设的利益和当地本社以外的农民的利益，和国家建设配合起来，和别的合作社、互助组、单干农民的要求配合起来。比如修水渠、修滩地，就不能只顾本社的利益，妨害了国家建设和别的农民弟兄们的利益。大家不互相配合，对自己社里也会有害。有的地方修滩地，这个社修在河东，那个社修在河西，就把河道弄成弯弯曲曲的了，水稍一大就会把地冲坏。植树造林，开垦荒地，都要照顾到畜牧业的利益。
    做好农业生产改革工作
    这里说的农业生产改革，主要是指这样一些事情：改革耕作技术，像深耕、密植、合理施肥、合理灌溉、因地种植等等；改革耕作制度，像实行倒茬、轮作等等；改良品种，像田间选种、去雄杂交等等；防治病虫害，像浸种拌种、药剂杀虫等等。这些事情都是我国农民过去没有做过或者做得不够好的；在农业生产方面把过去的不很好的办法换成好办法，把过去没用过的好办法用起来，就叫做农业生产改革。这些事情，单干户因为人力物力单薄，土地零碎，思想保守，大部分都很难办到。农业生产合作社是有比较好的条件的，比如有比较大的牲口和比较新式的农具，就能深耕；土地统一使用，就便于合理地使用肥料和水利，也便于按照不同的土质和地形种适宜的庄稼，也便于试验改进技术，便于选留好的种籽。这些事情做好了，也能大大增加生产，能更有效地和灾害作斗争，减少损失。农业生产合作社应该充分地利用自己的有利条件，把这些事情做好。
    在农业生产改革方面，有这样几点应当注意：第一，要适合当地和本社的具体情况。各个地方的气候、土质、庄稼的习性等等都不相同，所以生产改革的具体办法也各不相同；别的地方的经验是可以学而且应该学的，不过一定要把别的地方的条件和本地本社的条件比较一下，使它适合本地本社的条件，不可乱搬硬套。第二，要重视当地原有的好的增产经验。各地都有一些种庄稼的老手和好手，他们的经验是多年积累起来的，是很宝贵的；他们增了产，可是也许自己也不很清楚是什么道理，应该把他们的种地方法和一般的种地方法仔细比较比较，把增产的道理找出来。社里要注意奖励技术好的社员。第三，要一步一步改进。用新办法用得太快，因为没有经验，容易弄不好，反而受损失；光拿老辈子的办法当作宝贝，一点也不敢改，不敢往前走，不学习新的科学技术，社里的增产就会受限制，不能大大提高。第四，像农业基本建设一样，也要注意计算成本，要采用花钱少、收效大的办法来改革。
    做好副业生产工作
    一般农村的副业生产，主要是指这样一些事情：手工业，像编制竹器、烧木炭、开粉坊、榨油、烧石灰、做纸等等；畜牧饲养业，像喂养猪、羊、奶牛、鸡、鸭等等；园艺业，像培育果木、菜蔬等等；渔业，像养鱼、捕鱼虾等等；运输业，像赶大车、挑担、撑船等等；樵采业，像砍柴、采草药等等。总之，以农业为主的农民，经营别的任何生产事业，都可以叫做副业。不过，有一点是应当弄清楚的，就是这些事情应当主要是用社员自己的劳动来做的；如果主要是用钱来赚钱，那就成了商业，成了剥削的事，农业生产合作社是不应该干的。
    副业生产做得好，就能添加扩大农业生产的资金；像饲养、造林等副业，能积蓄肥料、保持水土，对农业生产有直接的好处；此外，还能使社员增加收入，改善生活。因此，农业生产合作社是可以根据自己的条件适当地经营一些副业的。因为农业生产合作社能有较多的剩余劳动力和财力，在经营副业方面也能显示出它的优越性来，这也是充分地利用农业生产合作社的好条件的一个方面。
    在副业生产方面，有这样一些事情要注意：第一，一定要顾到以发展农业为主的原则，任何时候都不能妨碍农业生产。过去有的社贪图“得现利”，过多地经营副业生产，号称有“八大企业”“四大坊”，不务正业，分散力量，结果农业减了产，副业得的利还没有农业方面丢的多，“抓住芝麻、丢了西瓜”。也有的盲目经营副业，反而赔了钱。大家千万不可错打了算盘。第二，副业生产一定要为农业生产服务。副业方面的收入，要尽可能多用在扩大农业生产方面；选择副业的时候，要尽可能选择对农业生产有好处的。第三，在经营副业，特别是手工业的时候，要先打听好有没有销路；最好先和供销合作社订好合同。第四，在发展副业，特别是畜牧业的时候，要注意当地和本社的技术条件，以免发生了牲畜疫病大批死亡等事故，造成损失。第五，适宜各家各户分开干的副业，就不要勉强集体经营。当然，社员们也要注意，不要因为自己贪干副业，误了社里的农业生产。
