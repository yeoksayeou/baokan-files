    Correcting the Phenomenon of Randomly Dragging Primary School Teachers into Social Activities
    —Reader's Letters Summary

    According to reader letters: Currently, the phenomenon of randomly dragging primary school teachers into central work and social activities is still prevalent in some areas, affecting the completion of school teaching plans and harming teachers' health. For example, Bai Yun from Ni Huzhuang Primary School in Zhuqing District, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, wrote: "Last summer, our district transferred twenty-five primary school teachers to participate in the general election work. Some teachers did not return to school until two months after the start of the semester, and nine teachers did not return until the winter vacation. This resulted in many classes in various schools having no teachers for a long time. However, before the semester ended, the district transferred fourteen teachers to participate in publicity work." All teachers of Dazhao Lou School, Madian Township, Gu Shu County, Henan Province, wrote: "Last December, the township government and the county work team required each of us to go to various villages every day for two hours of publicity work. We had to work until midnight every day before we could rest."
   The above-mentioned phenomenon of randomly dragging too many primary school teachers into social activities has seriously hampered school work and teachers' health. The main reason for this phenomenon is that some county and district cadres do not recognize the importance of education work. They only see the central work and disregard the normal education work of the school. Some even mistakenly believe that "central work overrides everything, and it doesn't matter if the school collapses," and that "failure to complete the central work tasks will be criticized, but it doesn't matter if the school work is not done well." It should be pointed out that primary school education is the basic education of the people and an indispensable part of the country's entire education cause. Ensuring the teaching quality of primary schools is not only of great significance for sending qualified graduates to secondary schools, but also ensures that some students directly engaged in agricultural production have a certain level of education, which is also very important.
    The primary responsibility of teachers is to do a good job in teaching. Therefore, it is obviously wrong to require teachers to participate in central work too much, thereby affecting their teaching business, and this must be corrected. However, what we mean by correcting the phenomenon of randomly dragging teachers into social activities is by no means not allowing teachers to participate in social activities, making them teach behind closed doors, and not caring about politics. Zhao Jiarun from Lianheng Joint Primary School in Jiande County, Zhejiang Province, reflected: Some teachers in the county emphasize doing a good job in teaching and simply ignore cadres and the masses who come to the school to ask for help. This has created a tendency to teach behind closed doors and become detached from the masses. This phenomenon is of course also wrong.
    The State Council of the Central People's Government stipulated in its December 11th last year instruction on rectifying and improving primary school education: "Teachers should not spend more than twelve hours per month participating in on-campus and off-campus community activities during the semester, and no more than one-sixth of the entire vacation during the winter and summer vacations (including centralized learning during the vacation)." All localities should appropriately organize primary school teachers to participate in social activities according to this principle to overcome the above-mentioned chaotic phenomena.

### 纠正乱拉小学教师参加社会活动的现象——读者来信综述

    纠正乱拉小学教师参加社会活动的现象
    ——读者来信综述
    根据读者来信反映：目前某些地区还普遍存在着乱拉小学教师参加中心工作和社会活动的现象，影响了学校教学计划的完成和妨害了教师的健康。如江苏省泰兴县杼青区倪浒庄小学白云来信说：“去年暑假我区抽调二十五个小学教师参加普选工作，有一部分教师到开学后二个月才回校，还有九个教师则到放寒假时还未回校，这就使各校很多班级长时期没有教师上课。但是学期还没结束，区上又调了十四个教师去参加宣传工作。”河南省谷熟县马店乡大赵娄学校全体教师来信说：“去年十二月份乡政府和县工作组要我们每人天天到各村作宣传工作二小时。我们每天都要工作到半夜才能休息。”
   上述乱拉小学教师过多地参加社会活动的现象，已严重地妨害了学校工作和教师健康。造成这种现象的主要原因是某些县、区干部不认识教育工作的重要性。他们只看到中心工作，而不顾学校正常的教育工作，甚至有的错误地认为“中心工作压倒一切，学校垮了台也不要紧”，“中心工作任务完不成要受批评，学校工作搞不好没有关系”。应该指出：小学教育是人民的基础教育，是国家整个教育事业中不可缺少的一环。保证小学的教学质量，不仅对于中等学校源源输送合格的毕业生有着重大意义，而且，保证某些直接从事农业生产的学生具有一定的文化水平，也是十分重要的。
    教师的主要责任是搞好教学工作，所以过多地要教师参加中心工作从而影响其教学业务，显然是错误的，必须予以纠正。但是我们所说的纠正乱拉教师参加社会活动的现象，决不是不让教师参加社会活动，使其关门教书，不问政治。浙江省建德县连横联合小学赵家润来信反映：该县有些教师强调搞好教学工作，对于干部与群众到学校来要求帮助做些事，干脆不理睬。这就造成了关门教书，脱离群众的偏向。这种现象当然也是不对的。
    中央人民政府政务院去年十二月十一日关于整顿和改进小学教育的指示中规定：“教师在学期当中，参加校内外社团活动时间，每人每月不得超过十二小时，寒暑假期不得超过整个假期的六分之一
  （假期集中学习包括在内）”。各地应该根据这一原则，适当组织小学教师参加社会活动，克服上述混乱现象。
