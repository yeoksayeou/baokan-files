Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, March 30th. Spring plowing is in full swing in Fujian, but the more than 1.5 million mu of wheat is about to ripen universally. Supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned grain departments in various parts of Fujian Province are supporting spring agricultural production by paying deposits to farmers for pre-purchasing wheat.

Fujian wheat ripens in large quantities in early April, with harvesting already underway in some areas of Jinjiang, Longxi, and Minhou Special Districts in early January. From March 1st to 19th, the funds farmers received from selling grain amounted to more than 2.2 billion yuan. In mid-March, state-owned grain departments in Fuzhou City and Minhou Special District successively paid farmers 3.1 billion yuan in pre-purchase funds (including a portion of soybean and barley pre-purchase funds). These 5 billion plus yuan can purchase approximately 32.2 million jin of fertilizer. Before the wheat matures, the pre-purchase work is still in progress.

    福建各地合作社和粮食部门
    向农民预购小麦
    【新华社福州三十日电】福建春耕正紧张进行，但一百五十多万亩小麦就要普遍成熟了。福建省各地供销合作社、国营粮食部门通过向农民预购小麦支付定金，支援春耕生产。
    福建小麦在四月上旬大熟，南部晋江、龙溪、闽侯专区一部分地区一月上旬已有收割。从三月一日到十九日，农民售粮得到的资金达二十二亿多元。福州市和闽侯专区国营粮食部门在三月中旬先后付给农民的预购金达三十一亿元（包括一部分大豆、大麦预购金）。这五十多亿元约可购买肥田粉三千二百多万斤。在小麦成熟之前，预购工作还在进行。
