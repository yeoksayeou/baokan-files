(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 27th) The "Truth Daily" of March 27th published an editorial entitled "For the Benefit of International Security and Peace."

The editorial stated that the Soviet government's statement yesterday regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is an important action in the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. The great historical significance of this new action in the Soviet government's foreign policy lies in its assistance to the German people in resolutely embarking on the path of peaceful development and realizing their national aspirations. At the same time, the Soviet government's statement is of great importance for European peace and for consolidating relations between the Soviet people and the German people.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet government's decision reflects the Soviet people's great trust in the democratic forces of the German people. The reason the Soviet Union adopted this decision is because it has consistently strived to assist the German people in restoring full independence, realizing the reunification of Germany, and ensuring that Germany develops according to a peaceful and democratic orientation. The editorial said that in order to achieve these goals, practical measures should be taken to bring East and West Germany closer together, hold free all-German elections, and conclude a peace treaty with Germany. However, these measures have not been adopted due to the attitude of the Western countries' representatives against restoring Germany's national unity and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The European plan of the Western Three Powers is to strive to establish the so-called "European Army" of six Western European countries, which is in fact an army with the revived West German armed forces as the protagonist. Therefore, the further action taken by the Soviet government this time is in line with the interests of the German people, and its purpose is always to peacefully resolve the German issue in accordance with the interests of all peace-loving people, including the German people.

The editorial continued, the Soviet Union has consistently helped, and is still helping, the German people to strengthen their bastion of democratic and peaceful forces – the German Democratic Republic. In this regard, the Soviet government has implemented a decision to reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations arising from the consequences of the war.

The Soviet government's new measures now fully guarantee the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic in its domestic affairs. As for the temporary stationing of Soviet troops on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, that is because the United States, Britain, and France refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to have the occupying countries simultaneously withdraw all troops from Germany—except for a small number of troops with strictly limited numbers.

The editorial emphasized that the residents of the German Democratic Republic have been relieved of the burden of military expenses, which the German people living in West Germany have to bear. Since January of this year, the German Democratic Republic has only allocated 4.5 percent of its budget for the expenses of the temporary stationing of Soviet troops on its territory. Since the German Democratic Republic has almost no military expenses, it is possible to use more and more funds to develop its peaceful economy, culture, and improve the people's happiness.

The situation in West Germany is different. Until now, it still has to use more than one-third of its budget to pay for occupation expenses, not to mention that it has not yet been exempted from the obligation to pay reparations. If the Bonn Treaty, which establishes an indefinite semi-occupation regime for West Germany, comes into effect, the residents of West Germany will bear a heavier and more humiliating burden than the Treaty of Versailles. Everyone knows that the Treaty of Versailles did not divide Germany; it stipulated partial occupation of Germany for fifteen years. The Bonn Treaty divides Germany, turns its western part into a vassal province of a foreign country, and legitimizes the occupation of the entire West Germany for decades.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Soviet government's decision has helped the peaceful forces of the German people in their struggle to re-establish Germany as a unified, democratic, peace-loving and independent country. Progressive mankind believes that the further consolidation of the German Democratic Republic is an important prerequisite for the final resolution of the German question. The German people, in this struggle to build a unified, independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, will always receive the sympathy and support of the Soviet people.

### “真理报”评苏联关于苏联和民主德国关系的声明  指出这是苏联和平外交政策的重要行动

    “真理报”评苏联关于苏联和民主德国关系的声明
    指出这是苏联和平外交政策的重要行动
   【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：三月二十七日的“真理报”刊登了一篇题为“为了国际安全与和平的利益”的社论。
    社论说，苏联政府昨天发表的关于苏联与德意志民主共和国之间的关系的声明，是苏联和平外交政策的重要行动。苏联政府外交政策这一新行动的重大历史意义在于：它协助德国人民坚决地走上和平发展的途径，并实现他们的民族愿望。同时，苏联政府的声明，对于欧洲和平以及巩固苏联人民与德国人民之间的关系，都具有非常重要的意义。
    社论指出，苏联政府的决定，反映了苏联人民对于德国人民的民主力量非常信任。苏联所以采取这个决定，是由于它一贯努力要协助德国人民恢复充分的独立、实现德国的重新统一以及保证德国根据和平民主的方针发展。社论说，为了实现这些目的，应该采取使东西德更加接近的实际措施，举行全德自由选举和缔结对德和约。但是，由于西方国家代表采取反对恢复德国的国家统一与缔结对德和约的态度，这些措施没有能够通过。西方三国的欧洲计划是为了努力设立六个西欧国家的所谓“欧洲军”，亦就是实际上由复活的西德武装部队担任主角的一支军队。因此，苏联政府这次采取的进一步行动，符合于德国人民的利益，其目的始终是为了按照全体爱好和平人民的利益，包括德国人民的利益来和平解决德国问题。
    社论接着说，苏联一贯在帮助，并且仍在帮助德国人民加强他们民主与和平力量的堡垒——德意志民主共和国。在这方面，苏联政府实行了减轻德国因战争后果而承担的财政与经济义务的决定。
    苏联政府的新措施现在充分保证了德意志民主共和国在国内事务中的主权。至于苏联军队的暂时留驻在德意志民主共和国的领土上，那是由于美英法拒绝接受苏联提出的占领国家同时自德国撤退所有军队——除了人数有严格限制的少数部队以外——的建议。
    社论着重指出，德意志民主共和国的居民已经被解除了军事费用的负担，而这是居住在西德的德国人民所不得不承担的。自今年一月以来，德意志民主共和国只在预算中拨出百分之四点五作为苏联军队暂时留驻在它的领土上的费用。由于德意志民主共和国几乎没有军事费用，所以它有可能用越来越多的资金来发展和平经济、文化并增进人民的幸福。
    西德的情况就不同了，到现在为止，它还是不得不在预算中用三分之一以上的款项来偿付占领费用，更不要提它还没有被免除支付赔偿费的义务了。假如为西德建立一个无限期的半占领政权的波恩条约生效的话，西德居民就要担负比凡尔赛条约更要沉重、更具侮辱性的负担。大家都知道，凡尔赛条约并没有瓜分德国，它规定部分占领德国十五年。而波恩条约使德国分裂，把它的西部变成了外国的一个附庸省份，并使整个西德被占领几十年合法化。
    社论最后说，苏联政府所作的决定，帮助了德国人民的和平力量为把德国重新建立为一个统一、民主与爱好和平的独立国家而作的斗争。进步人类认为德意志民主共和国的进一步巩固是最后解决德国问题的一个重要先决条件。德国人民在这个争取建立一个统一、独立、爱好和平与民主的德国的斗争中，将永远得到苏联人民的同情与支持。
