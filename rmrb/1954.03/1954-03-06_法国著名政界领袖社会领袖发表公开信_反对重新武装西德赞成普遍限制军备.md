Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 5th: According to TASS, twenty-two prominent French political and social leaders have published an open letter. The letter states:

    "The signatories of this letter reaffirm their determination to oppose the rearmament of West Germany according to the provisions of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. They denounce the submissive attitude of the French government. Under the pretext of promoting European unity, the French government is preparing to agree to the rearmament of Germany in order to satisfy demands that run counter to the interests of France. This is harmful to France. …

    "The signatories of this letter believe that efforts must be made to promote an agreement between East and West, so that all European countries can unite on a broad basis without exception. Clearly, at this time, rearming Germany, whether by establishing a so-called 'European Army' or by any other means, can only hinder the achievement of an agreement and can only endanger democracy.

    "What is needed now is not to arm a country known for its bellicosity, but to strive for universal and supervised arms limitation. Only in this way can European countries be able to allocate the necessary funds to restore their economies and improve the living standards of their people."

    Finally, the signatories of the open letter call on all French people to support them by gathering on March 13 on the Champs-Élysées in Paris and in front of war memorials throughout France to jointly condemn West German militarization.

    The signatories of the letter include: Édouard Herriot, Honorary President of the National Assembly; Édouard Daladier, former Prime Minister; Jacques Bardoux, Vice President of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly; Deputies Badie and Baylot (Radical Socialist Party), Denais (Young Republic Party), Gouneau (Communist Party); former ministers Michelet, René Capitant; Émile Kahn, President of the "Human Rights League"; Professor Bernard Lavergne, and writer Vercors, etc.

    法国著名政界领袖社会领袖发表公开信
    反对重新武装西德赞成普遍限制军备
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎四日讯：二十二个著名的法国政界领袖和社会领袖发表了一封公开信。这封信说：
    “在信上签名的人重申他们决心反对按照波恩条约和巴黎条约的规定把西德重新武装起来。他们揭发法国政府百依百顺的态度。法国政府借口促进欧洲团结，正在准备同意重新武装德国，以满足与法国的利益背道而驰的要求。这是对法国有害的。……
    “在信上签名的人认为必须努力促成东西方之间的协议，好让欧洲所有国家可以毫无例外地在广泛的基础上团结起来。显然，在现在这个时候，不论用建立所谓‘欧洲军’的办法还是用任何其他办法把德国重新武装起来，都只能阻碍取得协议，只能危害民主。
    “现在并不需要把一个素以好战著名的国家武装起来，而需要努力促进普遍地、有监督地限制军备。只有这样，才能使欧洲国家有能力拨出必要的款项来恢复它们的经济和提高人民的生活水平。”
    最后，在公开信上签名的人号召全体法国人支持他们，在三月十三日在巴黎爱丽舍大街以及法国各地的战争死难者纪念碑前集合，一同谴责西德军国主义化。
    在信上签名的有：国民议会名誉主席爱德华·赫里欧，前总理爱德华·达拉第，国民议会外交委员会副主席雅克·巴杜，议员巴迪与贝朗（激进社会党）、德尼（“青年共和”党）、谷尼欧（共产党），前部长密歇勒、雷纳·加比唐，“人权联盟”主席埃米尔·堪恩，伯纳·拉维尔涅教授和作家维戈尔等。
