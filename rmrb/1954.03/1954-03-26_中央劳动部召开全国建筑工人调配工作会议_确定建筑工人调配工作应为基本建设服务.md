    The Central Ministry of Labor convened a National Conference on the Deployment of Construction Workers from March 5th to 17th. Based on the general line of the state during the transition period and the situation of the deployment of construction workers, the conference discussed and determined the guidelines and tasks for the deployment of construction workers, exchanged work experiences, focused on studying the "Provisional Measures for the Deployment of Construction Workers," the "Measures for Concluding Labor Contracts for Construction Workers," and the "Measures for Concluding Temporary Transfer Contracts for Construction Workers," and exchanged detailed opinions on several issues in wage payment for workers in civil engineering and mechanical installation enterprises.

    The conference believes that the deployment of construction workers should serve capital construction, that is, to supply the labor force required for capital construction in a planned and organized manner, to assist construction enterprises in improving labor organization, to reduce idling and waste, to save state funds, and to cultivate skilled workers to ensure the smooth completion of national capital construction tasks.

    To this end, local construction worker deployment agencies should gradually plan the use and deployment of labor force based on local needs and work foundation; gradually ensure that the supplied workers are politically, technically, and physically suitable for the needs of capital construction; assist construction units in establishing and improving internal labor dispatch systems; assist relevant parties in gradually unifying the wage standards and technical standards of construction workers; and formulate necessary deployment rules and methods. The conference believes that under the leadership of the Party committee and in close cooperation with the construction departments, relying on the trade union is the main key to doing this work well.

    At the meeting, representatives from Shenyang, Tianjin, Harbin and other cities, and Shandong, Songjiang, Liaoxi and other provinces also introduced their work experiences. The conference believes that these experiences are valuable, and that correctly promoting them in light of local conditions will enable the deployment of construction workers to be carried out better.

    In the discussion of various issues, the attendees, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined and criticized the shortcoming of not having a clear enough idea of serving capital construction in the past, and realized the importance of doing a good job in the planned and organized supply of construction workers for the country's socialist industrialization, thereby strengthening their sense of responsibility and increasing their work confidence, laying a favorable foundation for further improving their work.

    中央劳动部召开全国建筑工人调配工作会议
    确定建筑工人调配工作应为基本建设服务
    中央人民政府劳动部在三月五日到十七日召开了全国建筑工人调配工作会议。这次会议，根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和建筑工人调配工作的情况，讨论并确定了建筑工人调配工作的方针任务，交流了工作经验，着重地研究了“建筑工人调配暂行办法”、“关于订立建筑工人劳动合同办法”、“关于订立建筑工人借调合同办法”，并对土木建筑、机械安装企业工人工资支付中的若干问题详细交换了意见。
    会议认为，建筑工人调配工作应当为基本建设服务，这就是有计划有组织地供应基本建设所需要的劳动力，协助建筑企业改进劳动组织，以减少窝工浪费现象，节省国家资金，并培养技术工人，保证国家基本建设任务的顺利完成。
    为此，各地建筑工人调配机关应根据当地需要和工作基础，逐步做到劳动力使用和调配的计划化；逐步做到供应的工人在政治、技术和体质方面适合基本建设的需要；要协助建筑单位建立和健全内部的劳动力调度制度，协助有关方面逐步统一建筑工人的工资标准和技术标准；要制订必要的调配规章办法。会议认为，在党委领导下和建筑部门密切配合，依靠工会，是做好这些工作的主要关键。
    会上，沈阳、天津、哈尔滨等市和山东、松江、辽西等省的代表还介绍了各方面的工作经验。会议认为这些经验是宝贵的，结合各地情况正确地加以推广将使建筑工人调配工作得到更好的开展。
    到会人员在各项问题的讨论中，本着批评和自我批评的精神，检查和批判了过去为基本建设服务的思想不够明确的缺点，认识到做好建筑工人的有计划有组织的供应工作对于国家的社会主义工业化的重要意义，因而加强了工作责任感，提高了工作信心，为进一步做好工作打下了有利的基础。
