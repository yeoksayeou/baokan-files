The Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party focused on inspecting the planning of enterprises such as the Pulin Power Plant and the Kaifeng Match Factory in mid-February, and found that the plans of some factories were conservatively formulated. For example, the average coal consumption of the Pulin Power Plant in January had already reached 1.338 kilograms, but the plant's annual plan target was only set at 1.381 kilograms; the labor productivity of the weaving factory in the first quarter of this year decreased by 5.32 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year, while the wage rate increased by 12.04 percent.

In order to give play to the role of existing industry in national construction and better meet the needs of the country and the people, the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has requested all factories in the city to seriously discuss the second quarter plan and revise the annual plan from March 15th to the end of the month, overcome conservative thinking, mobilize the masses to come up with ideas, and formulate advanced plans.

    中共开封市委会重点检查工厂生产计划
    中共开封市委会于二月中旬重点检查了普临电厂、开封火柴厂等企业制订计划的情况，发现有部分工厂的计划订得保守。如普临电厂煤耗一月份平均已经达到一点三三八公斤，该厂全年计划指标却只订了一点三八一公斤；织布厂劳动生产率今年第一季度比去年第四季度下降了百分之五点三二，工资率却上升了百分之一二点零四。
    为了发挥现有工业在国家建设中的作用，更好地满足国家和人民的需要，中共开封市委会要求全市各厂从三月十五日到月底，认真地讨论第二季度计划及修订年度计划，克服保守思想，发动群众想出办法，订出先进计划。
