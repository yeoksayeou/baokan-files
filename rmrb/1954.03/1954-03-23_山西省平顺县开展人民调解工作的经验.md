    Since the Anti-Japanese War, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in order to resolve civil disputes in a timely manner and reduce the time and money spent by the masses on litigation, began to focus on piloting the establishment of people's mediation committees in 1942. For more than ten years, thanks to the consistent attention of the county's party and government leading organs, gradual promotion, and constant attention to the rectification and improvement of mediation organizations, mediation committees have now been universally established and improved in all villages throughout the county.

    Over the years, the people's mediation committees in Pingshun County have combined with the central tasks of various periods to timely and correctly resolve a large number of civil disputes, playing a role in promoting education, uniting the masses, and restoring and developing production. For example, when Pingshun County issued land certificates in 1948, each village used the mediation committee as a basis, absorbed impartial farmers to participate, and formed mediation teams to assist in carrying out the work of issuing land certificates. The mediation teams in only four villages, such as Shicheng, resolved 1,457 disputes of all sizes related to land and housing for the masses. In 1952, when Pingshun County carried out the drought resistance and disaster prevention campaign, the mediation committees in various villages took the initiative to cooperate with this work and assisted in resolving many disputes related to water conservancy, enabling farmland to be irrigated in a timely manner. For example, the farmers of Huiyuanjiao and Muzhuawa, two natural villages belonging to Zhangjing Village, wanted to dig a canal to irrigate their land; however, because the canal had to pass through Liu Jinkui's land, Liu Jinkui refused to sell a waterway to the farmers of the two villages, and the canal digging work encountered difficulties. Mediation committee member Sang Bingwu learned about this matter and used the principles of drought resistance, disaster prevention, and unity for production to persuade and educate Liu, and as a result, the problem was resolved through consultation, and a canal was opened, turning more than 40 mu of dry land into paddy fields. With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the mediation committees in many villages have more plannedly dispersed mediation committee members into various production organizations to assist in resolving disputes related to the development of mutual aid and cooperation, playing a good role in promoting this movement. For example, when Chuandi Village established an agricultural production cooperative, Zhang Fuqiao and Li Keqin, a married couple, had a dispute over joining the cooperative, and the woman proposed to divorce the man. Guo Shenghai and Guo Baoyu, father and son, also wanted to separate because of different opinions on joining the cooperative. The village's mediation committee learned of these situations and conducted socialist education for them separately, explaining the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, both families joined the cooperative harmoniously.

    Another characteristic of Pingshun County's mediation work is that it pays attention to carrying out propaganda work through mediation. The mediation committee closely cooperates with local propagandists at all times, using propaganda tools such as loudspeakers, reading groups, and Q&A columns, or adopting the method of holding small-scale forums to publicize policies and laws to the masses. This has played a certain role in improving the political awareness and legal consciousness of the masses in order to prevent the occurrence of disputes. For example, in the past, more than 100 villages, such as Nanzhuang, often had conflicts between farmers and herdsmen due to grazing cattle and sheep trampling on farmland, constantly causing damage to crops and forests. After the mediation committee members of each village successively held meetings of herdsmen and educated the herdsmen with the principles of patriotism and increased production, such disputes rarely occurred. According to the statistics of the Pingshun County People's Court in the spring of 1953, the mediation committees of 84 villages handled a total of 766 disputes in three months, averaging about three cases per village per month, which was a quarter less than the average number per village per month in the previous year. Among them, only three disputes occurred in Zhangjing Village in three months, and no disputes occurred in Chuandi Village from January to March 1953. These statistics show that civil disputes in the county have been decreasing year by year, which is inseparable from doing a good job in mediation work and paying attention to propaganda and education in the mediation process.

    The reason why Pingshun County's mediation work has achieved remarkable results is mainly due to the active support of party and government leading organs. As early as 1944, the county's party and government leading organs proposed: "Strengthening the leadership of mediation work and mediating disputes among the people is one of the important ways to mobilize the masses to organize and produce." Later, they continued to instruct the district chiefs, secretaries, and civil affairs assistants of each district to constantly help and guide mediation work, and to absorb mediation committee members to participate in meetings discussing and arranging central work, so that they could understand the situation and be familiar with policies, and assist in promoting central work through mediation work. At the annual county-wide mediation work conference, the county chief also personally attended and gave a report. District and village cadres are also very enthusiastic about mediation work. At several village chief and party village branch secretary meetings and two civil affairs director meetings held successively in each district in the spring of 1953, the responsible comrades of each district emphasized the importance of actively carrying out mediation work. These measures have ensured that the county's mediation work has never collapsed in more than ten years, and has improved year by year.

    Secondly, the Pingshun County People's Court attaches great importance to mediation work, regarding it as one of its regular and important tasks, and has created some effective experiences in leading mediation work. One is to understand the situation through the court's cadres going to the countryside for circuit trials, and to specifically help the mediation committee members carry out mediation work. For example, in 1951, when court cadres went to the countryside, they found that more than 20 disputes had accumulated in villages such as Houbei and Nanzhuang, so they clarified the facts with the mediation committee members, explained the policies to them, and then used the masses' spare time to put forward opinions on the handling of various disputes to the masses, and the masses organized discussions. As a result, 11 cases were resolved in two evenings, and the policy and ideological level and business ability of the mediators were also improved. Another is to use typical pilot methods to create experience to promote mediation work throughout the county. From 1945, the county selected the mediation committees of eight villages with a better foundation, Zhangjing, Liujia, Shicheng, Wangjiazhuang, Dongchan, Sitou, Miaozhuang, and Hongtiguang, as the focus of cultivation, and later directly grasped and led the mediation work of five villages, Zhangjing, Chuandi, Yangwei, Shicheng, and Beidanche, and often widely disseminated typical experiences, which played a great role in promoting the correct development of mediation work throughout the county. Still another is that the county People's Court holds a county-wide mediation work conference once or twice a year to summarize work, exchange experience, explain policies and laws, and study mediation methods. At the county-wide mediation work conference in January 1953, the mediation personnel were also educated on the mass line in a comparative way, so that they further clearly realized that to do a good job in mediation work, they must follow the mass line, and understood how to follow the mass line. After the meeting, the county People's Court also issued a notice praising the exemplary deeds of Guo Dongze, a mediation committee member of Chuandi Village, and announced the illegal behavior of Bai Xianzhu, the director of the mediation committee of Bichicao Village (binding the parties for interfering with freedom of marriage), which also played a certain educational role for the mediation committee members.

    As early as 1946, the Pingshun County People's Court put forward the slogan for correctly carrying out mediation work: "Investigate and study, clarify the principles, solve problems thoroughly, clear up thoughts and do not bear grudges, and unite production with one heart." It repeatedly explained that mediation committee members must be diligent in their legs, diligent in their brains, and diligent in their mouths, and must not use coercion and command, must not fail to investigate and study, must not be biased, and must not be afraid of trouble. Through such continuous political and ideological education, many mediation committee members not only understood the policy principles of mediation work, but also were able to work hard without complaint and conduct in-depth investigation and research among the masses. For example, an old mediation committee member in Shicheng Village heard that the masses had a dispute and immediately rushed 15 miles in the dark to resolve it, and said: "The masses elected us as mediation committee members, and we must do a good job for the masses. In the old society, we had no right to speak!" Ma Xifu, the party branch secretary of Yangwei Village, and his uncle encroached on Ma Xianchang's wall boundary. The masses were very dissatisfied and said: "He is the branch secretary, how can he lose the lawsuit." After investigation and understanding by the mediation committee members, according to the clues obtained from interviewing the elderly, the foundation of the wall was dug up, and Ma Xifu also made a self-criticism on the spot and admitted his mistake. The masses were very satisfied, believing that the mediation work was very serious and only recognized the truth, not people. At the end of the work of filling out land ownership certificates in 1949, the mediation committee was rectified again. This rectification, through mass elections, replaced a part of the mediation committee members with bad work styles and irresponsibility, absorbed a group of impartial farmers who emerged from the work of filling out land ownership certificates with democratic work styles, enthusiastic work, and good at contacting the masses, and appropriately increased the number of mediation committee members to strengthen the organization. In view of the fact that the development of mediation work throughout the county was not balanced enough, when the townships were divided in the summer of 1953, a third rectification was carried out. With the establishment of township governments, the original 180 village mediation committees were reorganized into 101 township mediation committees.

    In this rectification combined with the division of townships, the first step was to start with checking the work, going deep into the masses to understand the ideology, work style, and policy mastery of the mediation committee members, so that there would be a clear understanding when rectifying. At the same time, the achievements were affirmed, the work enthusiasm and confidence of the mediation committee members were consolidated, and according to the different situations of each village, several major problems were focused on solving. For example, for the Liucun Mediation Committee, the focus was on rectifying its procrastination, crude work style, and eliminating the ideological concerns of some mediation committee members who were afraid of causing trouble and delaying work, which was very effective; in order to improve work efficiency, the mediation committee was also helped to summarize work, the mediation committee reported to the masses, and then the masses put forward opinions, and some villages re-elected the mediation committee members on this basis. After the above three rectifications, the original mediation organization was more sound, the mediation committees with successful work were further consolidated, and the mediation committees with little effect and bad work styles had significant changes. At present, the mediation committees throughout the county are working with confidence, becoming a powerful assistant to the local grassroots people's government and the people's court.

    山西省平顺县开展人民调解工作的经验
    中央人民政府司法部法律宣传司
    早在抗日战争时期，山西平顺县为了及时解决民间的纠纷，减少群众因诉讼而耗费时间和金钱，在一九四二年就开始重点试建人民调解委员会。十余年来，由于县的党政领导机关一贯重视，逐步推广，并经常注意了对调解组织的整顿和提高，现在调解委员会已在全县各村普遍建立和健全起来。
    历年来，平顺县的人民调解委员会曾经结合各个时期的中心工作，及时和正确地解决了大量的民间纠纷，对于教育和团结群众恢复与发展生产起了推动作用。例如一九四八年平顺县填发土地证时，各村曾以调解委员会为基础，吸收公正的农民参加，组成调解小组，协助开展填发土地证的工作。仅石城等四个村的调解小组，就给群众解决了有关土地、房屋等大小纠纷一千四百五十七件。一九五二年平顺县开展抗旱防灾运动时，各村的调解委员会又主动地配合这一工作，协助解决了许多有关水利的纠纷，使农田得以及时灌溉。如张井村所属的两个自然村——回元郊、木抓洼的农民，当时想要开渠浇地；但因水渠要从刘进魁的地内经过，而刘进魁不肯卖一水道给两村的农民，开渠的工作遭到了困难。调解委员桑丙午知道了这件事，就用抗旱防灾和团结生产的道理向刘进行说服教育，结果协商解决了这问题，开成了一道水渠，使四十多亩旱地变成了水田。随着农业互助合作运动的发展，许多村的调解委员会更有计划地把调解委员分散到各种生产组织中去，协助解决有关发展互助合作的纠纷，对于推动这一运动起了良好的作用。如川底村在成立农业生产合作社时，张付巧和李克勤夫妻两人因入社问题闹纠纷，女的提出要和男的离婚。郭生孩和郭保鱼父子也因对入社的意见不同而要分居。该村的调解委员会知道了这些情况，分别对他们进行了社会主义的教育，说明了农业生产合作社的优越性，结果两家都和和气气地入了社。
    平顺县调解工作的另一特点是注意了通过调解进行宣传工作。调解委员会时时和当地的宣传员密切配合，利用广播筒、读报组、问答栏等宣传工具，或采用开小型座谈会的方式，向群众宣传政策法令。这对于提高群众的政治觉悟和守法观念以预防纠纷的发生，是起了一定作用的。如过去该县南庄等一百多个村，常因放牧的牛羊践踏农田，不断地发生损害庄稼和山林的事情，引起农民与牧工之间的冲突。经各村调解委员先后召开牧工会议，用爱国增产的道理向牧工进行了教育，以后就很少发生过这类纠纷。根据一九五三年春季平顺县人民法院的统计，八十四个村的调解委员会在三个月内共处理了七百六十六件纠纷，每村每月平均约三件，比上年每村每月的平均数减少了四分之一。其中张井村在三个月中仅发生纠纷三件，川底村一九五三年一至三月根本未发生过一件纠纷。这些统计数字说明，该县的民间纠纷已在逐年减少，这是和作好调解工作，并在调解过程中注意了宣传教育分不开的。
    平顺县的调解工作所以取得显著的成绩，主要原因是党政领导机关积极支持。早在一九四四年，该县的党政领导机关即提出：“加强对调解工作的领导，调解人民间的纠纷，是发动群众组织起来生产的重要办法之一。”以后又不断指示各区的区长、秘书、民政助理员，要经常帮助与指导调解工作，吸收调解委员参加讨论和布置中心工作的会议，使他们了解情况和熟悉政策，通过调解工作协助推动中心工作。在每年召开的全县调解工作会议上，县长还亲自出席做报告。区、村干部也都很热心于调解工作。一九五三年春季各区先后召开的若干次村长、党村支部书记会议及两次民事主任会议上，各区的负责同志都强调了积极开展调解工作的重要性。这些措施，使十余年来该县的调解工作从来没有垮过台，而且逐年提高。
    其次是平顺县人民法院很重视调解工作，把它作为经常的重要任务之一，并创造了一些有效的领导调解工作的经验。一种是通过法院的干部下乡巡回审判时了解情况，并具体帮助调解委员进行调解工作。例如，一九五一年有一次法院干部下乡时发现候北、南庄等村积有纠纷二十余件，便与调解委员一同弄清了事实，向他们交代了政策，然后由他们利用群众的空闲时间，就各类纠纷向群众提出了处理的意见，由群众组织讨论。结果在两个晚间就解决了十一件，而调解人员也因此提高了政策思想水平和业务能力。另一种是用典型试办的方法创造经验，用以推动全县的调解工作。从一九四五年起，该县即选择了基础较好的张井、刘家、石城、王家庄、东禅、寺头、苗庄、虹梯关八个村的调解委员会，作为培养的重点，以后又直接掌握和领导张井、川底、杨威、石城、北耽车五个村的调解工作，并经常将典型经验广为传播，对推动全县调解工作的正确开展起了很大作用。再一种是由县人民法院每年召开全县调解工作会议一两次，总结工作，交流经验，讲解政策法令，研究调解办法。在一九五三年一月间全县的调解工作会议上，还用对比的方式对调解人员进行了群众路线的教育，使他们进一步明确地认识到：要作好调解工作，必须走群众路线，并懂得了怎样走群众路线。会后县人民法院又通报表扬了川底村调解委员郭东则的模范事迹，公布了笔池凹村调解主任白显珠的违法行为（因干涉婚姻自由捆绑当事人），对调解委员也起了一定的教育作用。
    平顺县人民法院早在一九四六年就提出了正确开展调解工作的口号：“调查研究，道理要说清，解决问题要挖根，打通思想不记仇，团结生产一条心。”反复说明了调解委员必须腿勤、脑勤、嘴勤而且不要强迫命令，不要不调查研究、不要徇情偏私、不要怕麻烦。经过这样不断的政治思想教育，许多调解委员不仅懂得了调解工作的政策原则，而且都能任劳任怨和深入群众调查研究。如石城村一位年老的调解委员听说群众有了纠纷，立即在黑夜里赶到十五里外去给解决，并说：“群众选咱当调解委员，一定要给群众办好事情。在旧社会，那有咱说话的权利哩！”扬威村党支部书记马喜付及其叔父侵占了马宪昌的墙界，群众很不满意地说：“人家是支部书记，还能打输了官司。”调解委员经过多方调查了解，结果根据访问老年人所得的线索，掘出了墙基，让马喜付亦当场做了检讨，承认了错误。群众很满意，认为调解工作很认真，只认理不认人。一九四九年填发土地所有证工作结束时，对调解委员会又作了整顿。这次整顿，通过群众选举，撤换了一部分作风恶劣、不负责任的调解委员，吸收了一批从填发土地所有证工作中涌现出来的作风民主、工作热情、善于联系群众的公正农民，并适当地增加调解委员名额，加强了组织。鉴于全县调解工作的发展还不够平衡，在一九五三年夏季划乡时，又进行了第三次的整顿，随着乡政权的建立，将原有一百八十个村调解委员会改组为一百零一个乡调解委员会。
    在这次结合划乡进行整顿中，首先是从检查工作着手，深入群众了解调解委员的思想、作风和掌握政策的情况，以便在整顿时心中有数。同时肯定其成绩，巩固调解委员的工作热情和信心，并根据各村的不同情况，有重点地解决几个主要问题。如对留村调解委员会，即着重整顿其拖延、粗暴的工作作风和解除某些调解委员怕惹人、怕误工的思想顾虑，收效很大；为了提高工作效能，还帮助调解委员会总结工作，由调解委员会向群众作报告，然后再由群众提意见，有些村即在此基础上改选调解委员。经过以上三次整顿，使原来调解组织更加健全，工作有成绩的调解委员会得到进一步的巩固，少数作用不大、作风恶劣的调解委员会也都有显著的转变。目前全县的调解委员会都在有信心地工作着，成为当地基层人民政府和人民法院有力的助手。
