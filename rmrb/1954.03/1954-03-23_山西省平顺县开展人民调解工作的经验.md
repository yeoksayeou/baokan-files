    Since the Anti-Japanese War, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in order to resolve civil disputes in a timely manner and reduce the time and money spent by the masses on litigation, began to focus on piloting the establishment of people's mediation committees in 1942. For more than ten years, thanks to the consistent attention of the county's party and government leading organs, gradual promotion, and constant attention to the rectification and improvement of mediation organizations, mediation committees have now been universally established and improved in all villages throughout the county.

    Over the years, the people's mediation committees in Pingshun County have combined with the central tasks of various periods to timely and correctly resolve a large number of civil disputes, playing a role in promoting education, uniting the masses, and restoring and developing production. For example, when Pingshun County issued land certificates in 1948, each village used the mediation committee as a basis, absorbed impartial farmers to participate, and formed mediation teams to assist in carrying out the work of issuing land certificates. The mediation teams in only four villages, such as Shicheng, resolved 1,457 disputes of all sizes related to land and housing for the masses. In 1952, when Pingshun County carried out the drought resistance and disaster prevention campaign, the mediation committees in various villages took the initiative to cooperate with this work and assisted in resolving many disputes related to water conservancy, enabling farmland to be irrigated in a timely manner. For example, the farmers of Huiyuanjiao and Muzhuawa, two natural villages belonging to Zhangjing Village, wanted to dig a canal to irrigate their land; however, because the canal had to pass through Liu Jinkui's land, Liu Jinkui refused to sell a waterway to the farmers of the two villages, and the canal digging work encountered difficulties. Mediation committee member Sang Bingwu learned about this matter and used the principles of drought resistance, disaster prevention, and unity for production to persuade and educate Liu, and as a result, the problem was resolved through consultation, and a canal was opened, turning more than 40 mu of dry land into paddy fields. With the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the mediation committees in many villages have more plannedly dispersed mediation committee members into various production organizations to assist in resolving disputes related to the development of mutual aid and cooperation, playing a good role in promoting this movement. For example, when Chuandi Village established an agricultural production cooperative, Zhang Fuqiao and Li Keqin, a married couple, had a dispute over joining the cooperative, and the woman proposed to divorce the man. Guo Shenghai and Guo Baoyu, father and son, also wanted to separate because of different opinions on joining the cooperative. The village's mediation committee learned of these situations and conducted socialist education for them separately, explaining the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, both families joined the cooperative harmoniously.

    Another characteristic of Pingshun County's mediation work is that it pays attention to carrying out propaganda work through mediation. The mediation committee closely cooperates with local propagandists at all times, using propaganda tools such as loudspeakers, reading groups, and Q&A columns, or adopting the method of holding small-scale forums to publicize policies and laws to the masses. This has played a certain role in improving the political awareness and legal consciousness of the masses in order to prevent the occurrence of disputes. For example, in the past, more than 100 villages, such as Nanzhuang, often had conflicts between farmers and herdsmen due to grazing cattle and sheep trampling on farmland, constantly causing damage to crops and forests. After the mediation committee members of each village successively held meetings of herdsmen and educated the herdsmen with the principles of patriotism and increased production, such disputes rarely occurred. According to the statistics of the Pingshun County People's Court in the spring of 1953, the mediation committees of 84 villages handled a total of 766 disputes in three months, averaging about three cases per village per month, which was a quarter less than the average number per village per month in the previous year. Among them, only three disputes occurred in Zhangjing Village in three months, and no disputes occurred in Chuandi Village from January to March 1953. These statistics show that civil disputes in the county have been decreasing year by year, which is inseparable from doing a good job in mediation work and paying attention to propaganda and education in the mediation process.

    The reason why Pingshun County's mediation work has achieved remarkable results is mainly due to the active support of party and government leading organs. As early as 1944, the county's party and government leading organs proposed: "Strengthening the leadership of mediation work and mediating disputes among the people is one of the important ways to mobilize the masses to organize and produce." Later, they continued to instruct the district chiefs, secretaries, and civil affairs assistants of each district to constantly help and guide mediation work, and to absorb mediation committee members to participate in meetings discussing and arranging central work, so that they could understand the situation and be familiar with policies, and assist in promoting central work through mediation work. At the annual county-wide mediation work conference, the county chief also personally attended and gave a report. District and village cadres are also very enthusiastic about mediation work. At several village chief and party village branch secretary meetings and two civil affairs director meetings held successively in each district in the spring of 1953, the responsible comrades of each district emphasized the importance of actively carrying out mediation work. These measures have ensured that the county's mediation work has never collapsed in more than ten years, and has improved year by year.

    Secondly, the Pingshun County People's Court attaches great importance to mediation work, regarding it as one of its regular and important tasks, and has created some effective experiences in leading mediation work. One is to understand the situation through the court's cadres going to the countryside for circuit trials, and to specifically help the mediation committee members carry out mediation work. For example, in 1951, when court cadres went to the countryside, they found that more than 20 disputes had accumulated in villages such as Houbei and Nanzhuang, so they clarified the facts with the mediation committee members, explained the policies to them, and then used the masses' spare time to put forward opinions on the handling of various disputes to the masses, and the masses organized discussions. As a result, 11 cases were resolved in two evenings, and the policy and ideological level and business ability of the mediators were also improved. Another is to use typical pilot methods to create experience to promote mediation work throughout the county. From 1945, the county selected the mediation committees of eight villages with a better foundation, Zhangjing, Liujia, Shicheng, Wangjiazhuang, Dongchan, Sitou, Miaozhuang, and Hongtiguang, as the focus of cultivation, and later directly grasped and led the mediation work of five villages, Zhangjing, Chuandi, Yangwei, Shicheng, and Beidanche, and often widely disseminated typical experiences, which played a great role in promoting the correct development of mediation work throughout the county. Still another is that the county People's Court holds a county-wide mediation work conference once or twice a year to summarize work, exchange experience, explain policies and laws, and study mediation methods. At the county-wide mediation work conference in January 1953, the mediation personnel were also educated on the mass line in a comparative way, so that they further clearly realized that to do a good job in mediation work, they must follow the mass line, and understood how to follow the mass line. After the meeting, the county People's Court also issued a notice praising the exemplary deeds of Guo Dongze, a mediation committee member of Chuandi Village, and announced the illegal behavior of Bai Xianzhu, the director of the mediation committee of Bichicao Village (binding the parties for interfering with freedom of marriage), which also played a certain educational role for the mediation committee members.

    As early as 1946, the Pingshun County People's Court put forward the slogan for correctly carrying out mediation work: "Investigate and study, clarify the principles, solve problems thoroughly, clear up thoughts and do not bear grudges, and unite production with one heart." It repeatedly explained that mediation committee members must be diligent in their legs, diligent in their brains, and diligent in their mouths, and must not use coercion and command, must not fail to investigate and study, must not be biased, and must not be afraid of trouble. Through such continuous political and ideological education, many mediation committee members not only understood the policy principles of mediation work, but also were able to work hard without complaint and conduct in-depth investigation and research among the masses. For example, an old mediation committee member in Shicheng Village heard that the masses had a dispute and immediately rushed 15 miles in the dark to resolve it, and said: "The masses elected us as mediation committee members, and we must do a good job for the masses. In the old society, we had no right to speak!" Ma Xifu, the party branch secretary of Yangwei Village, and his uncle encroached on Ma Xianchang's wall boundary. The masses were very dissatisfied and said: "He is the branch secretary, how can he lose the lawsuit." After investigation and understanding by the mediation committee members, according to the clues obtained from interviewing the elderly, the foundation of the wall was dug up, and Ma Xifu also made a self-criticism on the spot and admitted his mistake. The masses were very satisfied, believing that the mediation work was very serious and only recognized the truth, not people. At the end of the work of filling out land ownership certificates in 1949, the mediation committee was rectified again. This rectification, through mass elections, replaced a part of the mediation committee members with bad work styles and irresponsibility, absorbed a group of impartial farmers who emerged from the work of filling out land ownership certificates with democratic work styles, enthusiastic work, and good at contacting the masses, and appropriately increased the number of mediation committee members to strengthen the organization. In view of the fact that the development of mediation work throughout the county was not balanced enough, when the townships were divided in the summer of 1953, a third rectification was carried out. With the establishment of township governments, the original 180 village mediation committees were reorganized into 101 township mediation committees.

    In this rectification combined with the division of townships, the first step was to start with checking the work, going deep into the masses to understand the ideology, work style, and policy mastery of the mediation committee members, so that there would be a clear understanding when rectifying. At the same time, the achievements were affirmed, the work enthusiasm and confidence of the mediation committee members were consolidated, and according to the different situations of each village, several major problems were focused on solving. For example, for the Liucun Mediation Committee, the focus was on rectifying its procrastination, crude work style, and eliminating the ideological concerns of some mediation committee members who were afraid of causing trouble and delaying work, which was very effective; in order to improve work efficiency, the mediation committee was also helped to summarize work, the mediation committee reported to the masses, and then the masses put forward opinions, and some villages re-elected the mediation committee members on this basis. After the above three rectifications, the original mediation organization was more sound, the mediation committees with successful work were further consolidated, and the mediation committees with little effect and bad work styles had significant changes. At present, the mediation committees throughout the county are working with confidence, becoming a powerful assistant to the local grassroots people's government and the people's court.
