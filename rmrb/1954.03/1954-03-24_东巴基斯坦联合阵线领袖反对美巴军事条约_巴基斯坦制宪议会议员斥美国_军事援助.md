Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 23rd: Results from the East Pakistan Constituent Assembly elections, counted up to the evening of the 21st, show that the United Front has won 188 seats, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League has won 7 seats, and independent candidates have won 11 seats. The number of seats won by the United Front exceeds half of the total 309 seats in the East Pakistan Constituent Assembly, completely defeating the ruling Muslim League. United Front candidates defeated six ministers of the East Pakistan government in the election. At least fifty Muslim League candidates have lost their campaign deposits for failing to obtain the legally required minimum number of votes. Regarding the Muslim League's defeat in the election, the United Press stated that "the Muslim League suffered this setback in the election" shortly after the Pakistan government announced its acceptance of US military "aid."

The people of East Pakistan are holding various gatherings and demonstrations to celebrate the United Front's great victory.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to the Indian News Service, Maulana Abdul Hamid Bhashani, leader of the United Front, which won the East Pakistan Constituent Assembly election, pointed out in Dhaka on the 19th that the US-Pakistan military treaty is a "treaty that hinders Pakistan's freedom and undermines Pakistan's sovereignty." Bhashani said, "This enslaving treaty has mortgaged our motherland to the American imperialist warmongers."

Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: According to the Indian News Service: The spring session of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly continued on the 20th. Mian Iftikharuddin, leader of the Free Pakistan Party, said during the budget debate that because of accepting American military "aid," "Pakistan has now become part of the American war plan."

Chattopadhyaya, the opposition leader in the Constituent Assembly, also vehemently criticized US military "aid" during the debate. He cited US Assistant Secretary of State Robertson's remarks about the US needing to control Asia indefinitely as evidence to refute the deceptive argument that US "aid" would not interfere with Pakistan's sovereignty.

    东巴基斯坦联合阵线领袖反对美巴军事条约
    巴基斯坦制宪议会议员斥美国“军事援助”
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】东巴基斯坦制宪议会选举至二十一日晚的开票结果是：联合阵线已获得了一百八十八席，执政党巴基斯坦回教联盟得七席，无党派人士得十一席。联合阵线赢得的席位已超过东巴基斯坦制宪议会的全部席位三百零九席的半数，完全击败了执政党回教联盟。联合阵线的候选人在竞选中击败了东巴基斯坦政府的六个部长。回教联盟候选人在竞选中因不足法定的最低票数而丧失了参加竞选的保证金的至少已有五十人。对于回教联盟在竞选中的失败，合众社说，在巴基斯坦政府宣布它接受美国军事“援助”后不久，“回教联盟就在选举中遭到这个挫折”。
    东巴基斯坦人民正举行着各种集会和示威游行，庆祝联合阵线的巨大胜利。
    【新华社二十三日讯】据印度新闻处报道：在东巴基斯坦制宪议会选举中获得胜利的联合阵线的领袖毛拉纳·阿卜杜勒·哈密德·巴沙尼十九日在达卡指出：美巴军事条约是一个“阻碍巴基斯坦自由，破坏巴基斯坦主权的条约”。巴沙尼说：“这个奴役条约把我们的祖国押给了美帝国主义战争贩子。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】据印度新闻处消息：巴基斯坦制宪议会春季会议二十日继续举行。自由巴基斯坦党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁在辩论预算问题时说：由于接受美国的军事“援助”，“巴基斯坦现在已成为美国战争计划的一部分了”。
    制宪议会中的反对派领袖查托巴迪雅亚也在辩论时猛烈抨击美国的军事“援助”。他以美国助理国务卿罗伯逊关于美国应当无限期地控制亚洲的谈话为证据，驳斥了所谓美国的“援助”不会干涉巴基斯坦的主权的骗人论调。
