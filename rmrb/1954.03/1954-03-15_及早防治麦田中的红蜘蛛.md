    Prevent Wheat Field Spider Mites Early
    Xia Shurang from the Jiaoxian Agricultural Technology Guidance Station in Shandong writes: Since last winter, the weather in our area has been relatively warm, and with little rain and snow, pests in the fields have not been frozen to death. According to inspections conducted from February 19th to 23rd over five days, spider mites were found in more than 4,000 mu of wheat fields across seven districts. It is estimated that areas where spider mites occurred last year may also have this problem this year. In order to prevent insect pests early, local cadres should explain the causes and hazards of spider mites to the masses. Technicians from the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station should work with farmers to conduct on-site inspections. If spider mites are found in wheat fields, immediately mobilize the masses to combine current wheat field management practices and take measures such as rolling the wheat, irrigating the wheat, or applying pesticides to eliminate the pests, in order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest this year.

    及早防治麦田中的红蜘蛛
    山东胶县农业技术指导站夏树让来信：去冬以来，我处天气较暖，加上雨雪稀少，地里的害虫未被冻死。根据二月十九日至二十三日五天的检查，就发现七个区有四千余亩麦田有红蜘蛛。估计去年发生过红蜘蛛的地方，今年也可能存在这个问题。为了及早防治虫害，当地干部要向群众讲明红蜘蛛发生的原因及其危害，农业技术指导站的技术人员应协同农民实地检查，如果发现麦田有红蜘蛛，立即发动群众，结合当前麦田管理工作，采取压麦、浇麦或施用药剂的方法来进行除虫工作，以保证今年麦子的丰收。
