Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 19th: The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) continued its discussion on the work of the Committee on the Development of Foreign Trade at its morning session on March 18th. After consultations, the Soviet and British delegations finally drafted a joint proposal on this issue, which was unanimously adopted at the meeting. The agreement on the joint proposal, and the fact that it was unanimously adopted by the sixteen member states with voting rights in the committee, shows that these member states share a common concern for the further development of trade between European countries.

The representatives of the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom expressed satisfaction that the meeting had reached a consensus on such an important issue.

The Soviet representative, P.N. Kumykin, said that this reflected the desire for cooperation and mutual understanding among the members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, and hoped that this would serve as a precedent for the future work of the committee.

The meeting then discussed the report on the economic situation in Europe. The Hungarian representative, Kutash, pointed out the main shortcomings of the report. He said that the report gave the impression that its authors deliberately wanted to conceal certain facts about the economic situation in Western Europe and made no mention of the tragic impact of the arms race on the economy of Western Europe or the signs of the economic crisis in the United States. Kutash said that Hungary was concerned about the development of trade between Eastern and Western European countries and would actively support the efforts of the Economic Commission to this end.

The Byelorussian representative, Gurinovich, said that after studying the report and the statistics listed in the appendices, one could only conclude that the economic situation in many Western European countries had deteriorated last year. In the first quarter of 1953, the index of industrial production in Western European countries fell to 114, compared with 117 in the fourth quarter of 1952. Gurinovich pointed out that due to the militarization of the economies of Western European countries, industry tended to decline further.

The representative of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Dulle, spoke at the afternoon meeting. He pointed out the increasing signs of economic crisis in the United States and its adverse impact on the economies of Western European countries. Dulle described in detail the serious situation of the French economy. He pointed out that the current policy of economic militarization has made the situation of the working people in Western European countries even worse. Dulle concluded by saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe should show greater initiative in developing trade between Eastern and Western Europe.

The Soviet representative, P.N. Kumykin, delivered a speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 19th: The Soviet representative, Kumykin, spoke on March 18th at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe during the discussion of the economic situation report. He said that an economic situation report should be able to meet the following requirements: provide correct and sufficient information on current economic problems, objectively analyze the economic situation in European countries, correctly determine the economic development trends of these countries in the recent period, and point out the ways to expand economic cooperation. However, the report failed to meet all these requirements. It did not even have the intention of studying how to expand and strengthen trade ties between European countries, especially between Eastern and Western Europe.

The Soviet representative said that the report only focused on the positive aspects of the economic situation in Western European countries in 1953 and did not give due attention to the signs of deterioration in the economic situation of some countries and some important sectors. In 1953, Western European countries saw a decline in steel and coal production, and a prolonged depression in the textile and other light industrial sectors. The growing difficulties in the economic development of Western European countries were manifested in the inability to fully utilize industrial production capacity. The fact that many enterprises in Italy, France, Belgium and other countries went bankrupt is well known. In most Western European countries, orders for machine tool factories have also decreased. The report neglected the adverse impact of the "European Coal and Steel Community" on the industrial development and overall national economy of the countries participating in the organization and some other Western European countries.

The report also did not pay enough attention to analyzing the problem facing Western European countries, namely that the industrial production in the United States had begun to decline in 1953, as mentioned in the speeches of some of the representatives present.

The Soviet representative continued, saying that the general development trend of foreign trade in capitalist countries is that the rise in exports from these countries has stagnated since 1951. By 1953, the export volume of most Western European countries had not reached the level of 1951.

The Soviet representative then spoke about the achievements made by the Soviet national economy in 1953. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's economic ties were constantly expanding in 1953. In 1953 alone, the Soviet Union conducted trade with fifty-one countries, and trade with twenty-five of these countries was conducted on the basis of one-year or multi-year trade agreements. The Soviet Union's foreign trade volume in 1953 (calculated in prices) almost quadrupled compared to pre-war levels.

Kumykin concluded by saying that there is no doubt that the smooth development of trade between Eastern and Western European countries is in the interests of the countries engaged in trade, and can promote the further relaxation of international tensions and the consolidation of friendship between the peoples of all countries.

### 通过苏联和英国关于扩大贸易的联合提案  库米金指出西欧国家出口额的下降趋势

    通过苏联和英国关于扩大贸易的联合提案
    库米金指出西欧国家出口额的下降趋势
     【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦十九日讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会三月十八日的上午会议上继续讨论发展对外贸易委员会的工作。苏联与英国代表团在经过协商以后，终于就这个问题拟订了一项联合提案，这个提案在会上被一致通过了。在联合提案上达成一致意见，以及这个提案为委员会中有投票权的十六个会员国一致通过的事实表明，这些会员国对于欧洲国家之间贸易的进一步发展都具有共同的关切。
    苏联与英国的代表对于会议在这样一个重要问题上得到一致的意见表示满意。
    苏联代表帕·尼·库米金说，这件事反映了联合国欧洲经济委员会会员国之间要求合作与相互谅解的愿望，希望这会成为委员会今后工作的先例。
    会议接着讨论欧洲经济情况的报告。匈牙利代表库塔什指出这个报告的主要缺点。他说，这个报告给人这样的印象，就是这个报告的作者蓄意想掩饰西欧经济情况的某些事实，对扩充军备对于西欧经济的悲惨影响以及美国经济危机的迹象却只字不提。库塔什说，匈牙利关心东欧与西欧国家之间贸易的发展，并将积极支持经济委员会为此目的而作的努力。
    白俄罗斯代表古里诺维奇说，对于报告以及报告的附件中所列举的统计数字加以研究以后，大家只能得出这样的结论：去年，许多西欧国家的经济情况恶化了。在一九五三年第一季度，西欧国家的工业生产指数降低到一百一十四，在一九五二年的第四季度是一百一十七。古里诺维奇指出，由于西欧国家的经济军事化，工业有进一步衰退的趋势。
    世界工联的代表杜勒在下午会议上发言。他指出美国经济危机迹象的增加，以及这对于西欧国家经济的恶劣影响，杜勒详细叙述了法国经济的严重情况。他指出，现在经济军事化的政策使得西欧国家劳动人民的情况更加恶化了。杜勒最后说，世界工联认为，联合国欧洲经济委员会在发展东西欧贸易方面应该表现更大的主动性。
    苏联代表帕·尼·库米金在会上发表了演说。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦十九日讯：苏联代表库米金十八日在联合国欧洲经济委员会讨论经济情况报告书时讲了话。他说，一个经济情况报告书应该能满足下述几点要求：对目前的一些经济问题提供正确的和充分的情况，客观地分析欧洲各国的经济情况，正确地确定这些国家在最近时期的经济发展趋势并指明扩大经济合作的道路。但是报告书没有能满足这一切要求。其中甚至于连研究如何扩大和加强欧洲各国，特别是东西欧之间的贸易联系的意图都没有。
    苏联代表说，报告书中只着重指出一九五三年西欧各国经济情况中好的一面，而对一些国家以及一些重要部门经济情况恶化的迹象却没有给予应有的注意。一九五三年，在西欧各国表现为钢铁产量以及煤产量的下降，纺织业和其他轻工业部门的长期萧条。西欧各国经济发展中的日益增长的困难表现为不能充分利用工业的生产能力。意大利、法国、比利时和其他各国的许多企业倒闭的事实是大家知道的。在西欧大多数国家中，机器制造厂的订货也减少了。报告书忽视了“欧洲煤钢联营”对参加该组织的各国和一些其他西欧国家的工业发展和整个国民经济的发展的不利影响。
    报告书中也没有足够注意分析西欧各国所面临的这样一个问题，即一九五三年美国的工业生产已开始衰退了，这在到会的一些代表的发言中已经提到。
    苏联代表继续说，资本主义国家对外贸易的总的发展趋势是：这些国家的出口额上升情况从一九五一年起就停滞下来。到一九五三年，大多数的西欧国家的出口额都没有达到一九五一年的水平。
    苏联代表随即谈到苏联国民经济在一九五三年所取得的成就。他指出，一九五三年苏联的经济联系在不断扩大。在一九五三年一年中，苏联与五十一个国家进行了贸易，而其中与二十五个国家的贸易是根据一年或多年的贸易协定进行的。苏联一九五三年的对外贸易额（以价格计算）几乎增加为战前的四倍。
    库米金最后说，毫无疑问，东西欧各国之间的贸易的顺利发展是符合进行贸易各国的利益的，而且能促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和以及各国人民之间友谊的巩固。
