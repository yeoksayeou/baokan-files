    A Dispute
  　Wang Hong, Ren Shan
    Recently, a dispute arose among the loading workers at the South Plant of the state-owned Yangquan No. 3 Mine regarding the issue of wages. The cause of the dispute was that on January 12th, the South Plant successfully tested mechanical coal loading. The loading efficiency was more than four times higher than the previous manual operation. According to the original quota calculation, the workers' wages increased from a maximum of 25,000 yuan per person per day to 80,000 yuan. How should this be handled? Some people thought: "Using machines to load coal has liberated our labor, and earning 80,000 yuan a day is too much. It should be adjusted." Some people thought: "Our wages are so high, the higher-ups will definitely reduce the unit price." Still others thought: "The money we earn each day, besides making a set of clothes, can still leave some pocket money; let's hope it lasts a few more months, grab as much as we can."

    Xu Ladong is an old worker with over ten years of experience. He loves labor, and since the loading machine was successfully tested, he was overjoyed beyond words. He thought about the wage issue this way: "The state has given us machines, which is a big expense. If we each take 2.4 to 2.5 million yuan per month, it will exceed the living standards of ordinary worker brothers by four or five times. Shouldn't we consider the interests of the state and the lives of our worker brothers?" If this issue was not raised, he couldn't even sleep at night; but if he raised it, he was afraid some people would object. Later, he went to the trade union group leader and the administrative group leader and told them what was on his mind.

    On February 15th, the trade union group leader convened a meeting of all the workers in the group. As soon as the idea of writing a letter to the mine director requesting a reduction in wages was raised, it sparked a dispute. Some were in favor, some were against. Some said: "Why write a letter? The higher-ups won't let you earn so much all the time." Some said: "They will change the unit price even if we don't write a letter, why stick our necks out!" At this time, Xu Ladong stood up and said: "Everyone knows what kind of life we lived before liberation: being workers for life, with nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and still being beaten and scolded. After liberation, we changed to an eight-hour working day, reduced labor intensity, production increased, and our lives have also improved. Now the state is giving us machines to use, which is another great joy after decades! The country is our own, the mine is our own, everyone should first consider production. Besides, our contribution is small, how can one person take the wages of four or five workers?" Then the trade union group leader spoke at the meeting about the future of socialism. He said: "Yesterday we were still doing primitive labor, and today we have become mechanized. In the near future, as production further develops, we will live a happy life like the Soviet Union today. Therefore, we must regard the factory as our home. Only when the mine develops can our lives be further improved." With these words, some people with muddled thinking also became clear-headed. Worker Zhao Quan'er said: "This has really reminded me. If all the miners, all the workers in the country, embrace the idea of getting rich and do not consider the interests of the state, and do not wholeheartedly develop production, socialist industrialization will not arrive even in a thousand years."

    As a result of the dispute, the mine director received a letter from the loading workers, changed the unit price (the wages were slightly higher than before using machines), and praised them at a general meeting.

    一场争论
  　王洪  仁山
    最近在国营阳泉三矿南厂装车工人中，为工资问题发生了一场争论。争论的起因是：一月十二日南厂试用机械装煤成功，装车效率比过去人力操作提高了四倍多，按原来的定额计算，工人的工资就由过去每人每天最高两万五千元提高到八万元。这应当怎么办呢？有些人想：使用机器装煤解放了咱们的劳动，一天赚八万元太多，应该调整一下。有的人想：我们的工资这么高，上级一定要降低单价了。还有的又想：我们每天赚的钱除做一身衣服外，还能剩些零花；千万再延长几个月吧，抓一把是一把。
    许拉栋是个十来年的老工人，他热爱劳动，自从装车机试用成功后，心里高兴得说不出话来。他对工资问题是这样想的：“国家给我们增添了机器，开支很大，如果我们每月拿二百四、五十万元，就要超过一般的工人兄弟生活的四、五倍，难道我们不考虑国家利益和工人兄弟的生活吗？”这个问题不提出来，他晚上连觉也睡不着；提出来吧，又怕有些人反对。后来他就去找工会组长和行政组长，把心里话说了出来。
    二月十五日工会组长召开了全组工人会议，一提出给矿长写信要求降低工资的事情，就引起了一场争论。有的赞成，有的反对。有的说：何必写信，上级不会让你经常赚这样多的工资的。有的说：不写信也要改变单价，出那风头干啥！这时许拉栋起来发言：“谁都知道我们解放前过的是什么生活：当一辈子工人，吃的没吃的，穿的没穿的，还要挨打受骂。解放后我们改成八小时工作制，减少了劳动强度，生产提高了，我们的生活也改善了。现在国家给我们机器使用，这又是几十年来的一件大喜事呀！国家是我们自己的，矿厂是我们自己的，大家都应先考虑生产。再说，我们的贡献很小，怎能一个人拿四、五个工人的工资呢？”接着工会组长在会上谈起了社会主义的前途。他说：“昨天我们还是原始劳动，今天就成为机械化了。不久将来，生产更发展了，我们就要过着像苏联今天那样的幸福的生活。因此，我们要以厂为家。矿厂发展了，我们的生活才能进一步得到改善。”这么一说，有些思想糊涂的人也清醒过来了。工人赵全儿说：“这回可把我提醒了。如果全矿工人，全国工人都抱着发财的思想，不考虑国家利益，不全心全意地发展生产，社会主义工业化一千年也来不到。”
    争论的结果，矿长接到了装车工人的信，改变了单价（工资比使用机器前稍有提高），并在大会上加以表扬。
