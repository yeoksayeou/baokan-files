    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] According to Vietnam News Agency: "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast a commentary on the 16th entitled "Navarre Boasts of 'Victory,'" exposing Navarre's deceptive propaganda.
    The commentary said that Navarre, commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Indochina, recently published a message to the entire army in the French military's "Caravelle" weekly, in which he greatly boasted of his imagined "victory." According to him, the Vietnamese People's Army was defeated in the Red River Delta because the People's Army's plan to launch an all-out war in the area failed. However, he made no mention whatsoever of the fact that many puppet army battalions were annihilated, a large number of French military strongholds were removed, seventy-eight enemy aircraft were destroyed at Gia Lam and Cat Bi airports, and many trains, gunboats, and motorboats were destroyed; nor did he mention the heavy losses suffered by the French Expeditionary Force, losses that Navarre was forced to admit in military communiques.
    Navarre said that the Vietnamese People's Army's offensive against Dien Bien Phu had failed. But he remained silent about the fact that more than ten enemy battalions have been under siege in Dien Bien Phu all along.
    Navarre's boasts give the impression that his elite troops have achieved outstanding victories in Middle and Lower Laos. He seems to think it insignificant that the Lao People's Liberation Army currently controls the entire Route 8 and portions of Route 12 and Route 9, has annihilated several entire enemy battalions, and has liberated most of Khammouane Province and the entire Bolaven Plateau. According to Navarre, the Lao People's Liberation Army has also been defeated, but Navarre rarely talks about, or even mentions at all, the fact that his defensive line along the Nam Ou River was destroyed and Phongsaly Province was liberated.
    Navarre also did not mention the military situation in South Vietnam, where more than a hundred enemy strongholds or watchtowers have recently been either destroyed or abandoned, and thousands of puppet troops have defected to the people. Nor did he mention the major defeat suffered by the French army in Kon Tum Province, Central Vietnam.
    The commentary concluded by saying that Navarre, in order to reassure his troops, declared that the French invading forces are now only facing a few weeks of difficult times, after which it will be their turn to take the offensive. Let Navarre achieve victory with his mouth; the Vietnamese People's Army will inflict even heavier blows on the enemy on all fronts.

    纳瓦尔吹牛“得胜”——“越南之声”电台的评论摘要
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台十六日发表一篇题为“纳瓦尔吹牛‘得胜’”的评论，揭露纳瓦尔的欺骗宣传。
    评论说，印度支那的法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔于最近发表在法军“卡拉维尔”周刊上的告全军书中，大肆吹嘘他所想像的“胜利”。根据他的说法，越南人民军在红河三角洲被击败了，因为人民军计划在该地区发动一次全面的战争没有达到目的。但是，他丝毫没有提到许多伪军营被歼灭，大量法军据点被拔除，嘉林和吉碑机场的七十八架敌机被炸毁，许多火车、炮艇和汽艇被击毁的事实；他也不提法国远征军所遭受的惨重损失，这种损失曾是纳瓦尔在军事公报中不得不承认的。
    纳瓦尔说，越南人民军对奠边府发动的进攻遭到了失败。但是他对十多个营的敌军一直被围困在奠边府的事却只字不提。
    纳瓦尔的吹牛给人的印象是：他的精锐部队在中寮和下寮获得了出色的胜利。他似乎认为寮国人民解放军目前控制着整个第八号公路以及第十二号公路和第九号公路的一部分、歼灭了敌军几个整营、解放甘蒙省的大部分和整个波罗芬高原这些事实，都是没有什么意义的。根据纳瓦尔的说法，寮国人民解放军也被击败了，但纳瓦尔很少谈到甚至根本不谈他在南乌江沿岸的防线被摧毁和封萨里省被解放的事实。
    纳瓦尔也没有提到南越的军事情况，在那里，一百多个敌军据点或了望塔最近不是被摧毁了就是撤退了，几千名伪军都向人民投诚了。他也没有说到法军在中越南部昆嵩省遭受的重大失败。
    评论最后说，纳瓦尔为了安慰他的军队，宣称法国侵略军现在只有几个星期的困难时期了，以后就要轮到他们采取攻势了。让纳瓦尔去取得嘴巴上的胜利吧，越南人民军将在各个战线上给敌军以更沉重的打击。
