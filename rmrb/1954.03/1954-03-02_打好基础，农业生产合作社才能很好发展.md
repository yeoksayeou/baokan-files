Building a Solid Foundation for the Sound Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Jia Jun, Secretary of the CPC Changzhi Prefectural Committee

In 1953, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, had a total of 984 agricultural production cooperatives. In the past few months, another 2,752 new cooperatives have been established, completing the 1954 annual plan for cooperative establishment. Adding new and old cooperatives together, the total number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region is now 3,736. A total of 81,864 peasant households joined the new cooperatives. The old cooperatives, in the process of expansion, newly developed 21,825 households, bringing the total number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in the region to over 100,000 in recent months. The proportion of households participating in cooperatives to the total number of households in the region has increased from the original 5.4 percent to 19.7 percent. Among them, there are 446 large cooperatives, accounting for 12 percent of the total number of cooperatives. Among these, 350 were expanded from old cooperatives, and 96 were newly built. There are 358 cooperatives with 50 to less than 100 households; 74 cooperatives with 100 to less than 150 households; and 6 cooperatives with 150 to less than 250 households. There are 8 large cooperatives that have branch cooperatives under them, with unified leadership, independent operation, and independent distribution. At present, all cooperatives have formulated their production increase targets and production plans for this year, are engaged in intensive winter production, and are driving mutual aid teams to launch a heated production competition movement.

The relatively large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture is mainly due to a relatively broad and solid foundation.

One foundation is that the region has already established more than 900 cooperatives in the past three years; and the Party's general line for the transition period has been vigorously promoted. Under the illumination of the general line, and with more than 900 cooperatives as living examples, the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses has been unprecedentedly enhanced. At the beginning of the general line propaganda, the prefectural committee summarized the production achievements and superiority of the 984 cooperatives as the content of the propaganda. In the more than 40-day large-scale and vigorous propaganda campaign of the general line and grain purchase in the rural areas, the peasants of the entire region further realized the benefits of participating in agricultural production cooperatives from the following facts: The average yield per mu of autumn fields of the 984 cooperatives, distributed in more than half of the region's townships, was 310 jin, exceeding the average yield of 238 jin per mu of autumn land in the region by more than 30 percent. The peasant households in the cooperatives accounted for 5.4 percent of the total number of households in the region, and the land occupied 4.2 percent of the total land in the region, while the increased production of the cooperatives accounted for 12.5 percent of the total increased production in the region. The average autumn and summer yield of ten old cooperatives was 285 jin, exceeding the regional average of 200 and 14 liang per mu by more than 42 percent. The average harvest per member was 748 jin, which was 191 jin higher than the regional average of 557 jin per person. In the state's planned grain purchase, the superiority of the socialist-natured collective farm and the semi-socialist-natured agricultural cooperative was further demonstrated. The surplus grain sold by peasant households in the region accounted for 14.5 percent of the total harvest, while the surplus grain sold by the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" collective farm accounted for 29.3 percent of its total harvest. The surplus grain sold by ten old cooperatives accounted for 17 percent of their total harvest, of which the surplus grain sold by the Wei Mingbiao cooperative in Wuxiang accounted for 28.1 percent of its total harvest. The high yield and large grain sales of agricultural production cooperatives greatly attracted the hearts of the peasants. Those who were hesitant and waiting in the past are now actively participating. Some peasants said, "The earlier you get on the boat, the earlier you transition, the earlier you live a good life." A mutual aid team in Gaoping wrote a letter to the district committee requesting approval to establish a cooperative, saying, "We hope you will approve our establishment of a cooperative as soon as possible. If you don't approve it, we will form a cooperative in secret." The enthusiasm of the peasants to join the cooperatives is very high, and they are actively signing up. In the entire prefecture, 6,797 mutual aid teams, with 137,299 households, requested to establish cooperatives.

The second foundation is that in 1953, the tendency of blind and reckless advance was corrected, the position of mutual aid and cooperation was consolidated, and the policy level of the cadres was improved. There are about 1,500 cadres at the district level and above in the region who have direct experience in establishing cooperatives, which is an important condition for the large-scale development of new cooperatives. At the same time, after correcting the tendency of agricultural cooperatives blindly carrying out the entry of livestock, flocks, and means of production into the cooperatives, reducing the proportion of land dividends, such as too strict and rigid labor management, the concerns of the peasants were dispelled, and the broad masses of peasants further understood the purpose and policy of establishing cooperatives. In this work of developing agricultural production cooperatives, attention was also paid to promptly correcting the conservative ideas and rash tendencies in leadership, ensuring the normal development of cooperative establishment work. At the beginning, the right-leaning conservative thinking among cadres was serious, "fearing to advance rashly," unable to see the new situation, ideologically right-leaning, and acting passively; after the masses were initially mobilized, "left" emotions arose in thinking. For example, it was said: "You can establish as many as you want." Blindly establishing large cooperatives. In mid-December, the prefectural committee timely convened a meeting of mutual aid and cooperation cadres, criticizing the "left" and right tendencies; in early January, it convened a meeting of county party secretaries, fully assessing the favorable and difficult conditions for establishing cooperatives in the region, implementing the policy of "active leadership, steady advance," and repeatedly revising the development plan.

The third foundation is that the region has already developed a large number of mutual aid teams. In 1953, the peasant households organized in the region reached 74 percent of the total peasant households, of which there were 15,000 permanent mutual aid teams. For the past three years, agricultural production cooperatives have contacted a large number of mutual aid teams. Since the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the policy of driving mutual aid teams forward has been implemented, with each cooperative contacting several mutual aid teams. In 1952, 284 cooperatives contacted 2,020 teams. According to statistics from six counties last year, cooperatives contacted 7,615 mutual aid teams. The methods of contact were: holding regular meetings, visits, comparisons, spreading production experience and methods of evaluation and record-keeping, and helping each other overcome difficulties. In this way, the mutual aid teams have generally learned some experience and methods of establishing cooperatives. With the propaganda and implementation of the general line, the confidence and determination of the peasants to actively take the socialist road have been further encouraged and strengthened. Thus, a new situation has emerged in which a large number of mutual aid teams are requesting to be transferred to cooperatives. According to statistics from 1,080 new cooperatives, 300 cooperatives, or 27.7 percent, were established mainly by one team; 553 cooperatives, or 51.2 percent, were established by merging two teams; and 227 cooperatives, or 21 percent, were established by more than three mutual aid teams. The 154 new cooperatives in Tunliu County were transformed from 213 permanent mutual aid teams with three to ten years of experience and three seasonal teams. In Qingshui County, those established by transferring one team to one cooperative accounted for 35 percent of the new cooperatives. According to statistics from four counties, members of new cooperatives were originally members of mutual aid teams, accounting for 97.4 percent, while individual households joining cooperatives accounted for only 2.6 percent. The public accumulation fund and public property accumulated by the mutual aid teams over the years were brought into the cooperative at the same time, so that the cooperative had a part of the funds for expanding reproduction from the beginning. This kind of development of new cooperatives is both smooth and steady.

In addition, Changzhi Prefecture has also gained the following experience in this development of agricultural production cooperatives:

1. After the new cooperative is established, it is necessary to firmly grasp production and make achievements. After the peasants sign up to join the cooperative, elect the cooperative cadres and management committee, they can announce the establishment, immediately lead the members to discuss democratically, determine the land to be entered into the cooperative, formulate a plan to increase production and income, discuss methods to ensure the realization of the plan, and immediately organize labor for production with reference to the methods of the old cooperative. The greater the achievements in production, the higher the morale of the members, and the more the hearts of the masses are towards the cooperative. In this way, a foundation is laid for solving the contradiction between the individual and the collective and various problems within the cooperative. As for land evaluation, the entry of livestock and farm tools into the cooperative, and the establishment of a labor system, they can be gradually resolved as the needs of the cooperative's production develop and during the gaps in production. For example, the Gukou cooperative in Gaoping, as soon as it was established, firmly grasped agricultural and sideline production. Sideline production earned 2.5 million yuan in half a month, and then bought livestock and put it into reproduction, which the members were very satisfied with. At the beginning of the establishment of the new cooperative in Xiluotuo Village, Licheng, it was driven into production by the old cooperative, cutting 24,300 jin of firewood for fuel, earning 3.38 million yuan from sideline production, and repairing 85 pieces of farm tools. In this way, the process of launching the establishment of the cooperative has also become the process of launching the increase in production; in launching the increase in production, the enthusiasm of the masses for establishing the cooperative has also become higher.

2. It is necessary to make good use of the old cooperatives, impart specific experience in establishing cooperatives, and cultivate backbone members for establishing cooperatives. Many old cooperatives have talked to the new members about the benefits they have received in the cooperative, and introduced the specific policies and methods for establishing cooperatives (such as reviewing members, land and means of production entering the cooperative, recording work, evaluating work, etc.), which not only further carried out ideological mobilization for the new members, but also solved the difficulties of new cooperative cadres with insufficient leadership experience. Wuxiang County organized 95 teaching stations, which taught twice during the establishment of cooperatives, solving the specific difficulties of the new cooperatives, giving the new cooperative cadres methods, and further strengthening their confidence in establishing cooperatives. At the same time, the entire region trained more than 12,000 people, including cooperative directors, accountants, team leaders, township branch secretaries, and district cadres for establishing cooperatives, studying the resolutions of the CPC Central Committee on mutual aid and cooperation, as well as the articles of association, policies, and practices for establishing cooperatives, and improving their ability to establish cooperatives and their policy level. In this way, the mobilization for establishing cooperatives and the cultivation of backbone members are closely combined, and the process of establishing cooperatives is also the process of improving the leadership ability of backbone members.

3. The establishment of cooperatives should be combined with the rectification and development of mutual aid teams. In this establishment of cooperatives, Changzhi Prefecture helped rectify mutual aid organizations, and at the same time mobilized non-cooperative peasants to join mutual aid teams, helped set production plans, established links between mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and actively prepared for the conditions for establishing cooperatives; in this way, the mutual aid teams were also driven forward at the same time. For example, in the establishment of cooperatives in Changzi County, 3,393 households joined mutual aid teams, and the number of peasant households organized in the county increased from 74.5 percent of the total number of households to 80 percent. The Gukou Township in Gaoping newly established two cooperatives, and at the same time mobilized 68 peasant households to participate in mutual aid teams, increasing from the original 72 percent to 82.5 percent. In this way, the phenomenon of "cooperatives rising and teams scattering" or "new cooperatives being isolated" has been avoided.

    打好基础，农业生产合作社才能很好发展
    中共长治地委书记　贾俊
    山西省长治地区一九五三年共有九百八十四个农业生产合作社；近几个月又新建立了二千七百五十二个社，已经完成了一九五四年度的建社计划。新社老社加起来，总共全区已有三千七百三十六个农业生产合作社。参加新社的农户共计八万一千八百六十四户；老社在扩大中新发展农户二万一千八百二十五户，总计全区有十万多户在最近几个月中参加了农业生产合作社。入社户占全区总户数的比例，已由原来的百分之五点四增至百分之十九点七。其中大社有四百四十六个，占总社数的百分之十二。其中由老社扩大的三百五十个，新建的九十六个。五十户以上不满百户者三百五十八个；一百户以上不满一百五十户者七十四个；一百五十户以上不满二百五十户者六个；大社下设分社，统一领导、各自经营、各自分配者八个。目前各社都已订出了今年增产指标和生产计划，紧张地进行冬季生产，并带动互助组展开了热烈的生产竞赛运动。
    长治地区的农业生产合作社能够这样比较大量地发展，主要原因是有了比较广阔、坚实的基础。
    基础之一，是全区在过去三年中已经办好了九百多个社；而且大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线。在总路线的照耀下，并且有了九百多个社做活的榜样，农民群众的社会主义觉悟空前提高了。在宣传总路线的开始，地委就总结了九百八十四个社的生产成绩和优越性，作为宣传的内容。在农村四十余天规模壮阔、声势浩大的宣传总路线和粮食收购运动中，全区农民从下列事实中，进一步体会到参加农业生产合作社的好处：分布在全区一半以上的乡的九百八十四个社秋田每亩平均产量三百一十斤，超过全区秋地平均产量二百三十八斤百分之三十强，入社的农户占全区总户数的百分之五点四，土地占全区土地总数的百分之四点二，而社的增产量就占全区增产量的百分之十二点五。十个老社秋夏平均产量二百八十五斤，超过全区每亩平均二百斤十四两百分之四十二强。社员每人平均收获量为七百四十八斤，比全区每人平均五百五十七斤高出一百九十一斤。在国家粮食计划收购中，更显示出社会主义性质的集体农庄与半社会主义性质的农业社的优越性。全区农户售余粮占总收获量百分之十四点五，“中苏友好”集体农庄售余粮数占其总收获量的百分之二十九点三。十个老社售余粮占其总收获量的百分之十七，其中武乡魏明标社售余粮占其总收获量的百分之二十八点一。农业生产合作社增产高、卖粮多，大大地吸引了农民的心，过去犹豫、等待的人，现在也积极参加了。有的农民说：“早上船，早过渡，早过好光景。”高平有一个互助组给区委写信要求批准办社，信上说：“希望你们早日批准我们办社，不批准，我们就明组暗社。”农民入社的热情很高，踊跃报名，全专区要求办社的互助组达六千七百九十七个，户数达十三万七千二百九十九户。
    基础之二，是在一九五三年纠正了盲目冒进的偏向，巩固了互助合作的阵地，干部政策水平提高了。全区已有直接办社经验的区级以上干部约一千五百余人，这是大量发展新社的重要条件。同时，纠正了农业社盲目进行牲口、羊群、生产资料入社，降低土地分红比例，如劳动管理太严太死等偏向后，解除了农民的顾虑，使广大农民进一步理解了办社的目的和政策。在这次发展农业生产合作社的工作中，又注意及时纠正领导上的保守思想和冒进倾向，保证了建社工作正常发展。开始，干部中右倾保守思想严重，“害怕冒进”，看不到新的情况，思想右倾，行动消极；当群众初步发动之后，思想上又产生“左”的情绪。例如说：“想办多少就能办多少。”盲目办大社。十二月中旬，地委及时召开了互助合作干部会议，批判了“左”的和右的倾向；一月初，又召开县委书记会议，充分估计了全区办社的有利条件和困难条件，贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，反复修订了发展计划。
    基础之三，是全区已经大量地发展了互助组。一九五三年全区组织起来的农户，已达总农户的百分之七十四，其中常年互助组有一万五千个。三年来，农业生产合作社联系了广大互助组。自有农业社以来，就实行了带动互助组前进的方针，每个社联系几个互助组。一九五二年就有二百八十四个社联系了二千零二十个组。去年六个县统计，社联系互助组达七千六百一十五个。联系的方法是：定期开会、参观、评比、传播生产经验和评工、记工办法，互相帮助克服困难。这样，就使互助组大体上都学到了一些办社经验和办法。加以总路线的宣传贯彻，进一步鼓舞和坚定了农民积极走社会主义道路的信心和决心。于是，就出现了大批互助组要求转社的新情况。据一千零八十个新社统计，其中以一个组为主建成社者三百社，占百分之二十七点七；两个组合并建一个社者五百五十三社，占百分之五十一点二；三个以上互助组建成一社者二百二十七社，占百分之二十一。屯留县新建的一百五十四个社，是二百一十三个三年至十年的常年互助组和三个季节组转成的。沁水县一组转一社者，占新建社的百分之三十五。又据四个县统计，新社社员原是互助组组员者占百分之九十七点四，单干户入社者只占百分之二点六。互助组历年积累的公积金和公共财产，同时带进社内，使社一开始就有了一部分扩大再生产的资金。这样发展新社，既顺利，又稳当。
    此外，长治地区在这次发展农业生产合作社中还取得以下的经验：
    一、新社建成后要紧紧抓住生产，作出成绩。农民报名入了社，选出了社干部和管理委员会，就可以宣布成立，立即领导社员民主讨论，确定入社土地，订出增加生产、增加收入的计划，讨论出保证实现计划的办法，立即参照老社的办法组织劳力进行生产。在生产上的成绩越大，社员的情绪就越高，群众的心越向社。这样，就打下了解决个人与集体的矛盾和社内各种问题的基础。至于土地评产、牲口农具入社、建立劳动制度等，可以随着社内生产发展的需要，在生产空隙逐步解决。如高平谷口社，一建社就抓紧了农副业生产，副业生产半月就赚了二百五十万元，随即买了牲口投入再生产，社员十分满意。黎城西骆驼村一开始建立新社，就被老社带动卷入生产，割柴备燃二万四千三百斤，副业赚了三百三十八万元，修置了农具八十五件。这样，发动办社的过程也就成了发动增加生产的过程；在发动增加生产中也就使群众办社的热情更高了。
    二、要好好运用老社，传授建社的具体经验，培养办社骨干。许多老社向新入社的农民谈了自己在社内得到的利益，介绍了办社的具体政策和办法
  （如审查社员、土地和生产资料入社、记工、评工等办法），不但进一步对新社员进行了思想发动，而且解决了新社干部领导经验不足的困难。武乡全县组织了九十五个传授站，在建社期间传授了两次，解决了新社的具体困难问题，使新社干部有了办法，更坚定了办社的信心。同时，全区又训练了社长、会计、组长、乡支部书记、办社的区干部等共一万二千多人，学习了中共中央关于互助合作的决议及办社的章程、政策、作法，提高了他们的办社能力和政策水平。这样，就把发动建社和培养骨干密切地结合了起来，办社的过程也就是提高骨干领导能力的过程。
    三、建社要和整顿发展互助组相结合。长治地区这次在建社中帮助整顿了互助组织，同时发动不入社农民加入互助组，帮助定生产计划，建立互助组和农业生产合作社的联系，积极准备办社条件；这样，就同时带动了互助组。如长子全县在建社中，就有三千三百九十三户参加了互助组，全县组织起来的农户由总户数的百分之七十四点五，增加到百分之八十。高平谷口乡新建了两个社，同时动员六十八户农民参加了互助组，由原来组织起来百分之七十二，增加到百分之八十二点五。这样，就避免了“社起组散”或“新社孤立”的现象。
