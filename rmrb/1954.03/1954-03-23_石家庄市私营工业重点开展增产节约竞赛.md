    Shijiazhuang Private Industry Focuses on Launching Increased Production and Economy Campaign
    Shijiazhuang has focused on launching an increased production and economy campaign in thirteen private industrial enterprises. More than 3,200 employees have participated in the campaign, and significant results have been achieved in the past three months.
    I. The expected results of increasing production, improving quality, reducing waste, and lowering costs have been achieved. According to incomplete statistics, the total output value increased by more than 5.007 billion yuan in the past three months. Generally, output increased by 30% to 50%. For example, Da Xing Textile Factory completed the state cotton cloth processing task ten days and twenty hours ahead of schedule, and the percentage of first-class cloth increased from 92.45% to 96.97%. You Lian Weaving Factory solved the problem of standard yarn usage (45 yarns per inch of cloth), which had always been considered unsolvable, guaranteeing quality and saving 49 bundles and 13 yards of yarn.
      II. The awareness of employees has been raised, labor discipline has been strengthened, and unity among employees has been enhanced. Through the publicity and education of the general line, most employees felt that they "had a better understanding," reversing the ideological sentiment of some workers who were unwilling to work in private factories and who believed that launching a competition in private factories was simply for capitalists to make money. For example, Li Linzao, a worker at the Yu Xing Zhan Boiler Factory, said: "In the past, competitions were for winning banners and receiving rewards, but this time it is for the early realization of socialism." Many workers reviewed their past lax labor discipline and lack of concern for production in group meetings, and attendance rates increased significantly during the competition. In addition, unity among employees has also been strengthened. For example, Wang, a technician at the Jin Hua Chopping File Factory, who was relatively conservative in the past, took the initiative to take on apprentices this time. The old worker Zhao Junren used to be very taciturn, but he has also been very active in this competition. He said: "After studying the general line, my heart is clear. I cannot bring my skills to the grave. I want to compete with young people." Employees in all factories that have launched competitions are filled with an optimistic attitude of loving socialism, which is the main driving force behind the competition.
    III. Labor-capital relations have been improved, and the confidence of the capitalists in management has been enhanced. In the competition movement, all employees have once again received class education and policy education, enabling them to understand the principles and methods of carrying out united struggles against capitalists. Some problems have been resolved well through labor-capital consultation meetings. Due to continuous improvements in production, the capitalists feel that there are profits to be made, and they have also adopted a more proactive attitude towards issues such as workers' welfare and safety equipment. For example, during this competition, the You Lian Weaving Factory capitalists added four dormitories for workers. Yi He Xin Dyeing Factory invested more than 7 million yuan to install ventilation equipment. Generally, food issues have been improved in factories, and cultural and recreational equipment has been added. In addition, many capitalists have been educated by the facts and have also turned to a more active attitude in management. You Lian Weaving Factory is now preparing to expand the factory; the three factory directors of Yi He Xin Dyeing Factory were not responsible for each other before the competition, but now they have become active and have also carried out division of labor to participate in business management. They are currently planning to expand the factory building and add machinery. Both of these factories have requested joint state-private ownership.

### 石家庄市私营工业重点开展增产节约竞赛

    石家庄市私营工业重点开展增产节约竞赛
    石家庄市有重点地在十三户私营工业企业中开展了增产节约竞赛运动，参加竞赛的职工达三千二百多人，三个月来已取得显著成绩。
    一、达到了增加产量、提高质量、减少浪费、降低成本的预期效果。据不完全统计三个月中增产总值共达五十亿零七千多万元。一般产量提高百分之三十至百分之五十。如大兴纺织厂提前十天二十小时完成了国家棉布加工任务，正布率由百分之九十二点四五提高到百分之九十六点九七。友联织布工厂解决了历来认为不能解决的标准用纱（每寸布四十五根纱）问题，保证了质量，并节省纱线四十九捆十三码。
      二、提高了职工觉悟，加强了劳动纪律和职工内部的团结。通过总路线的宣传教育，一般职工都觉得“心中有底了”，扭转了部分工人不愿在私营工厂工作和认为在私营工厂中开展竞赛是单纯为资本家赚钱的思想情绪。如玉兴栈锅厂工人李林藻说：“过去竞赛是为夺锦旗受奖励，这次是为了早日实现社会主义。”不少工人在小组会上检讨了过去劳动纪律松弛和不关心生产的思想，在竞赛中出勤率显著上升。另外在职工内部也加强了团结，如金华剁锉厂过去比较保守的王技师，这次也主动带徒弟了。老工人赵俊仁过去非常沉闷，但在这次竞赛中也表现的很积极，他说：“学习了总路线心眼里豁亮了，我不能把技术带到土里去，我要和青年人比一比。”凡是开展竞赛的工厂中的职工，都充满了热爱社会主义的乐观情绪，这是推动竞赛的主要力量。
    三、改善了劳资关系，提高了资方经营信心。在竞赛运动中，全体职工再次受到了阶级教育与政策教育，使他们懂得了如何对资本家进行团结斗争的道理和方法。有些问题通过劳资协商会议解决得挺好。由于生产上不断改进，资方感到有利可得，对于工人的福利和安全设备等问题也采取了比较主动的态度。如这次竞赛中友联织布工厂资方给工人增添了四间宿舍。义合信漂染厂用七百余万元安装了通风设备。一般厂子对伙食问题均有所改善，并添置了文娱器具。此外，许多资方受到了事实的教育，在经营态度上也转向积极。友联织布厂现准备扩建工厂；义合信漂染厂三个厂长在竞赛前互不负责，现在也积极起来了，并进行了分工，参加业务管理。现正筹划扩建厂房，增添机器。这两个工厂都要求公私合营。
