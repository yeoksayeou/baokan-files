Lanxin Railway Wushaoling Fifth Engineering Section Speeds Up Construction
The entire staff of the Fifth Engineering Section of the Lanxin Railway Wushaoling are working hard to start laying tracks on June 1st this year.

This year's Wushaoling project on the Lanxin Railway is even more arduous and massive than last year, with the total state investment increasing by more than 50% compared to last year. According to the arrangement of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, track laying will begin at 190 kilometers on June 1st. Therefore, the large and small tunnels and many bridge, culvert, and spillway projects that this section of the line passes through must be basically completed by the end of June. These projects are concentrated in the Wushaoling and western Longgoubao areas, where the mountains are high, the ravines are deep, and the projects are extremely difficult.

In order to achieve this glorious and arduous task, the workers are working selflessly. The workers excavating Tunnel No. 4 in Longgoubao are engaged in fierce battles with frozen soil and rocks and the large amounts of water rushing out of the tunnel. Sometimes, they are soaked all over, and their arms and legs cannot move freely because their clothes are frozen hard. However, the workers continue to display creativity and find many tricks to improve work efficiency. For example, using hard paper rolled into tubes to hold explosives saved more than 900 detonators in just over ten days; they promoted the advanced method of single-person drilling and hole-making, increasing the amount of drilling from 1.8 meters per person in eight hours to 3.8 meters.

### 兰新铁路乌鞘岭第五工程段加紧施工

    兰新铁路乌鞘岭第五工程段加紧施工
    兰新铁路乌鞘岭第五工程段全体职工正为争取今年六月一日开始铺轨而努力工作。
    今年兰新铁路乌鞘岭工程比去年还要艰巨、还要浩大，国家投资总额较去年增加了百分之五十以上。根据中央人民政府铁道部第一工程局的布置，要在六月一日由一九零公里开始铺轨。因此，这一段线路所要经过的大小隧道和许多桥、涵管、泄水洞等工程，必须在六月底基本结束。这些工程都集中在乌鞘岭和西部的龙沟堡地区，山高沟深，工程十分艰巨。
    为实现这一光荣而艰巨的任务，工人们正在忘我地劳动。开挖龙沟堡四号隧道的工人，与冻土石块、从隧道内奔出的大水进行着激烈的搏斗。有时，他们浑身上下都被水浸透了，胳膊和腿都因衣服冻硬而不能自由伸屈。但是工人们仍然发挥创造性，找出许多窍门，提高了工作效率。如用硬纸卷成筒，装炸药，十来天内就节省了九百多个雷管；推广了单人打眼、创眼的先进工作法，由每人八小时打眼一公尺八增加到三公尺八。
