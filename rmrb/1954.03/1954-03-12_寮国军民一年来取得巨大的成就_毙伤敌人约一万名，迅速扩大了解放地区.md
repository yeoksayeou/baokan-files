Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, March 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency, Vientiane, March 10th: The Laotian Resistance Government, on the occasion of commemorating the third anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos People's Alliance (March 3), released a brief on the achievements of the Laotian military and civilians in the past year.

The brief stated: Since the liberation of Sam Neua in April 1953, the Laotian resistance has made great progress in the past year. The Laotian People's Liberation Army, in the glorious victories won in Upper Laos, Central Laos, and Lower Laos, as well as in the increasingly consolidated guerrilla areas, guerrilla bases, and sporadic battles in enemy-occupied areas, has killed and wounded approximately 10,000 enemies. Currently, the area of the liberated areas is 100,000 square kilometers, with a population of one million; this does not include the newly liberated Phongsaly Province. The rapid expansion of the liberated areas has partially thwarted the enemy's conspiracy to conscript soldiers to make up for their troop shortages.

The brief continued, now, local resistance governments have been established in nine of the ten provinces of Laos. The hearts of the people in the newly liberated areas are also turned towards the resistance government. The Lao Free National United Front is becoming more and more consolidated, including many mass organizations from all walks of life and all ethnic groups. At the same time, Laos's increasingly strengthened resistance has received increasing support from the people of the world. The reports made by the Laotian delegation, which participated in the Vienna World People's Peace Congress and the Bucharest Fourth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival, upon their return to the country regarding the sympathy and support of peace-loving people from various countries for the Laotian resistance, greatly encouraged the Laotian people.

The brief stated that, thanks to the assistance of the resistance government in agricultural tools, seeds, and technology, the Laotian production increase movement has achieved good results. Despite the drought and enemy sabotage, the efforts of farmers in the Laotian liberated areas have ensured a normal rice harvest. At the same time, the Laotian people have also achieved great success in the literacy campaign in the past year.

The brief finally pointed out that the French colonialists and American interventionists are conspiring to continue and expand the war of aggression, and are accelerating the expansion of the Laotian puppet army and intensifying the plundering of the people's property. The Laotian Resistance Government called on the Laotian people to overcome various difficulties, unite more closely with the people of the two brotherly countries of Vietnam and Cambodia, and thwart all the enemy's conspiracies.

    寮国军民一年来取得巨大的成就
    毙伤敌人约一万名，迅速扩大了解放地区
    【新华社十一日讯】　据越南通讯社寮国十日讯：寮国抗战政府在纪念越南、高棉、寮国人民联盟成立三周年（三月三日）之际，发表寮国军民近一年来所取得的成就的简报。
    简报说：自一九五三年四月桑怒解放以来的将近一年中，寮国抗战有了巨大的进展。寮国人民解放军在上寮、中寮和下寮取得辉煌胜利的战斗中，以及在日益巩固的游击区、游击基地和在敌占区进行的零星战斗中，毙伤敌人约一万名。现在，解放区的面积有十万平方公里，人口有一百万；这还未包括新解放的封萨里省。解放区的迅速扩大，部分地粉碎了敌人抓丁以弥补其兵员不足的阴谋。
    简报接着说，现在，寮国的十个省份中已有九个省成立了地方抗战政府。新解放地区的民心也都向着抗战政府。寮国自由民族统一战线一天比一天巩固，它包括各阶层和各民族的许多群众组织。同时，寮国的日益加强的抗战得到了全世界人民越来越大的支持。曾参加维也纳世界人民和平大会和布加勒斯特第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的寮国代表团回国后所作的关于各国爱好和平人民对寮国抗战的同情和支持的报告，使寮国人民受到了很大的鼓舞。
    简报说，由于抗战政府在农具、种子和技术方面的帮助，寮国的增加生产运动取得了良好的成就。尽管遭到旱灾和敌人的破坏，寮国解放区农民的努力保证了水稻的正常收获量。同时，寮国人民近一年来在扫除文盲运动中也同样获得了很大的成绩。
    简报最后指出，法国殖民者和美国干涉者正在阴谋继续和扩大侵略战争，并在加速扩充寮国伪军和加紧掠夺人民的财物。寮国抗战政府号召寮国人民克服种种困难，更加紧密地与越南、高棉两个兄弟国家的人民团结起来，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋。
