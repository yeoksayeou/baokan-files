Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: Just as the people of the world are expecting the Geneva Conference to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue, the US Department of Defense is "increasingly worried about the possibility of a ceasefire in Indochina" - this is according to the Associated Press Washington dispatch on the 5th, quoting "authoritative sources."

Currently, the United States is trying to entice France to continue this war, which is hindering the easing of international tensions. Harold Stassen, director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, who just returned from a "visit" to the Far East and Indochina, said at a press conference in Washington on the 5th: "The United States currently has no other policy than to implement the Navarre Plan in order to achieve victory in Indochina." He affirmed that even during the Geneva Conference or the Indochina armistice negotiations, the United States would never slow down the delivery of "aid" materials for the Indochina war. On the contrary, the United States will increase "aid" to enable France to continue this bloody war. Stassen said that the preliminary plan for the US "aid" program to the Far East in 1955 was discussed by US military officials in Manila in February. "The plan is based on the principle that we (the United States) will continue to expand our efforts in Asia," including continuing to support the Indochina colonial war. Stassen announced that the United States will allocate more than $1 billion in military "aid" to Indochina this year to support France and the Bao Dai puppet army in their operations. He revealed that the United States has stipulated in the budget that the "aid" to Indochina in the fiscal year ending June 30 this year will be between $1.06 billion and $1.16 billion. The materials allocated under this plan will be delivered roughly by the end of 1954. Stassen also revealed that some of the weapons to be shipped to Indochina this year have been drawn from the "inventory" originally intended for the war of aggression against Korea.

While increasing "aid," more and more American aviation personnel are being投入 to the Indochina war. The notorious Chennault's so-called "Civil Air Transport Company" announced on the 5th that it had signed an agreement with the French government to send twenty-four American pilots to Indochina to fly C-119 aircraft supplied by the US government and maintained by US Air Force personnel. In addition, the company will also send four "other personnel" to Haiphong to engage in "ground support work." The company's spokesman said that although the term of the agreement is nominally three months, it is "actually indefinite."

On the other hand, the United States is trying every means to seize the leadership of the war from France. One of the main contents of the US plan is to conspire to control the Bao Dai puppet army. The Associated Press said, "The (US) Joint Chiefs of Staff's proposal to send a training group to Indochina is still valid" - the "fundamental meaning" of this proposal "is to enable Vietnam to train more troops in order to prepare for the next campaign in October after the rainy season." In order to realize this plan as soon as possible, the US Department of Defense is "eager to send (the new head of the US 'Military Assistance Advisory Group' in Indochina nominated by the United States) O'Daniel to Indochina as soon as possible." The United States is very anxious about the declining morale of the Bao Dai puppet army. The Associated Press said: "It is said that the possibility of reaching a ceasefire arising from the Geneva Conference is affecting the morale of the Vietnamese army." Therefore, O'Daniel will not only provide reports on the situation in Indochina, but also make an estimate of the morale of the Bao Dai puppet army and their combat capabilities.

In addition, the United States is also expanding its intervention in the war through neighboring regions of Indochina, especially Thailand. "Business Week" said: "The United States is trying to support the regions around Indochina as a supplement to the US aid to the battlefield," and "Thailand occupies a key position in this strategy," although "the Thai government has always been unpopular and politically unstable." Under the direction and "aid" of the United States, the Thai government of Luang Phibunsongkhram is expanding its army and military bases, and making Thailand a transit station for the United States to transport military supplies to Indochina. The United States is also conspiring to have Thailand and the puppet groups of Cambodia and Laos sign an "alliance" as a tool for the United States to expand its intervention in the Indochina war, and is preparing to maintain some war bases in Indochina when the war of aggression against Vietnam fails. According to the Associated Press, US military experts believe that once the French army is forced to withdraw from Vietnam, the United States must "do everything possible" to seize Cambodia and Laos, "therefore, it is very likely that a Buddhist national defense group including Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia will be formed under the strong encouragement and support of the United States."

### 美国统治集团害怕和平解决印度支那问题  加紧诱迫法国继续进行印度支那战争

    美国统治集团害怕和平解决印度支那问题
    加紧诱迫法国继续进行印度支那战争
    【新华社八日讯】正当世界人民期望日内瓦会议协商和平解决印度支那问题的时候，美国国防部却“越来越担心印度支那可能获致停战”——这是合众社华盛顿五日电引“权威人士”说的话。
    目前美国正努力诱迫法国把这个妨碍国际紧张局势趋向缓和的战争继续打下去。刚从远东和印度支那“访问”返国的美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生五日在华盛顿的记者招待会上说：“美国目前除了把纳瓦尔计划付诸实行以图在印度支那取得胜利之外，别无其他政策。”他并肯定地表示，即使在日内瓦会议或印度支那停战谈判期间，美国也绝不放慢对印度支那战争“援助”物资的运送速度。相反地，美国将增加“援助”来使法国继续进行这个流血战争。史塔生说，美国一九五五年对远东“援助”计划的初步计划已由美国军事官员们二月间在马尼拉讨论过了。“该计划系基于我们（美国）继续在亚洲扩大努力的原则”，其中包括继续支持印度支那殖民战争。史塔生宣布，美国在今年将再拨给印度支那价值十亿美元以上的军事“援助”，以支持法国及保大伪军作战。他透露，美国已在预算中规定，在到今年六月三十日为止的财政年度中给予印度支那的“援助”将介于十亿六千万美元到十一亿六千万美元之间。根据这项计划拨付的物资大体上将在一九五四年年底交付完毕。史塔生并透露，准备在今年运往印度支那的一些武器，已从原来为了进行侵略朝鲜的战争的“存货”中抽拨。
    和增加“援助”的同时，越来越多的美国航空人员被投入印度支那战争。惟恐天下不乱的陈纳德的所谓“民用航空运输公司”五日宣布，该公司已和法国政府签订一项协定，准备在日内派遣二十四名美国驾驶员到印度支那去，驾驶由美国政府供给的并由美国空军人员保养的C—一一九型飞机。除此以外，该公司还将派遣四名“其他人员”到海防去从事“地勤工作”。该公司的发言人说，虽然协定的期限名义上是三个月，但是“实际上是无一定期限的”。
    另一方面，美国正在想尽办法要把战争的领导权从法国手中夺取过来。美国计划的主要内容之一就是阴谋把保大伪军控制在自己手里。合众社说，“（美国）参谋长联席会议所提派遣训练团去印度支那的建议是仍然有效的”——这个建议的“根本意思”“在于使越南能训练更多的军队，以便为雨季后十月间下一次战役作出准备”。为了使这个计划早日实现，美国国防部“切望尽速派遣（美国提名的美国驻印度支那‘军事援助顾问团’新团长）奥丹尼尔到印度支那去”。美国对日益低落的保大伪军的士气，感到十分焦虑。合众社说：“据说从日内瓦会议中产生的达成停战的可能性对越南军队的士气是有影响的”。因此，奥丹尼尔不仅将要对印度支那的情形提供报告，并将对保大伪军的士气和他们的作战能力作出估计。
    除此之外，美国还在通过印度支那邻近地区、特别是泰国来扩大干预战争。美国“商业周刊”说：“美国正试图支持印度支那周围的地区来作为美国对于战场现场的援助的一种补充”，“泰国在这个战略中占着关键性的地位”，虽然“泰国政府一向是既不得民心而政治上又不稳固的”。在美国的指使和“援助”下，泰国銮披汶政府正在扩建军队和军事基地，并且使泰国成了美国向印度支那输送军火的转运站。美国并阴谋使泰国和高棉、寮国的傀儡集团签订“联盟”，作为美国扩大干预印度支那战争的工具，并准备在越南侵略战争失败时，美国仍可在印度支那保持一部分战争基地。据合众社透露，美国军事专家认为，一旦法国军队被迫退出越南，美国就要“竭尽一切努力”抓住高棉和寮国，“因此就很可能要在美国的坚决鼓励和支持之下组成一个包括泰国、寮国和高棉的佛教国家防御集团”。
