　　Xinhua News Agency, London, March 4th: The British Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" published a very significant statistic on March 1st. This statistic shows that since the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, British opposition to the rearmament of West Germany has greatly increased.
　　The Gallup poll results published by the newspaper are: Among those consulted, only 20 percent support the rearmament of West Germany, while 46 percent believe that the West should be ready to negotiate with the Soviet Union at any time. However, in 1953, 35 percent favored the rearmament of West Germany, and 40 percent opposed it.

    英国反对重新武装西德的人大大增加了
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英国自由党的“新闻纪事报”在三月一日发表了一个很有意味的统计，这个统计表明：柏林四国外长会议以来，英国反对重新武装西德的人大大增加了。
    该报发表的盖洛普民意测验的结果是：在被征询意见的人中，只有百分之二十赞成西德重新武装，而有百分之四十六认为西方应随时准备和苏联协商。但是在一九五三年时，赞成重新武装西德的是百分之三十五，反对的是百分之四十。
