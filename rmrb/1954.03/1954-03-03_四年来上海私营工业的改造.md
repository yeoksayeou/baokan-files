    The Transformation of Shanghai's Private Industry Over the Past Four Years
    By our reporter Ai Fang
    Shanghai's industrial production plays a significant role in national industrialization and the people's livelihood.
    Private industry constitutes a large proportion in Shanghai. Taking the textile industry's equipment as an example, private cotton mills account for about 1.18 million spindles out of Shanghai's approximately 2.35 million spindles. In dyeing and weaving, machinery, and the production of daily necessities, private factories account for an even larger proportion. According to 1953 statistics, the output value of Shanghai's private industry accounted for 63.39 percent of Shanghai's total industrial output value [Note 1] -- including the output value of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales. If this portion of output value is excluded, the output value of private factories that are heading towards the free market accounts for only 26.88 percent. Of course, this only refers to the quantity of private industry. From a quality perspective, it cannot be compared with socialist state-owned industry. This quantity situation indicates that the task of utilizing, restricting, and transforming Shanghai's private industry is a major and arduous task in the past and in the future period – the entire socialist transformation period.
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Shanghai Party and government leading organs have carried out a series of tasks in implementing the utilization, restriction, and transformation of private industry. After liberation, all the contradictions and abnormal phenomena that had formed in Shanghai under the long-term rule of imperialism and bureaucratic capital were fully exposed. Private industries that originally relied entirely on imperialism for raw materials, or whose sales were abroad, or whose sales and raw materials were both abroad, fell into a state of stagnation or semi-stagnation when they were subjected to the blockade and bombing by American bandits. When prices gradually stabilized, the false prosperity of the market based on inflation and speculation disappeared, and a temporary sluggishness and stagnation appeared in the market. Under these circumstances, a large number of private enterprises that were not beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, or that were not closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and could not be utilized by the state or could not be widely utilized by the state, such as large hotels, large restaurants, wholesale merchants who profited from resales, and high-end fashion stores, went out of business. The People's Government has taken all effective measures for all enterprises closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood -- loans, vigorous development of the production of economic crops, development of transportation, smooth flow of urban and rural material exchanges, expansion of processing, ordering and purchasing -- to solve all the difficulties encountered in its production. In 1951, the national market was unprecedentedly prosperous, and Shanghai's private industrialists and businessmen were rampant with "five poisons". In 1952, the People's Government led the broad masses of people to oppose the "five poisons" behavior of private industrialists and businessmen and launched the "Five-Anti" movement. During the "Five-Anti" movement, the government provided many economic benefits to private industry and continued and even expanded processing and ordering in some aspects. The state has also continuously adjusted the relationship between public and private sectors and the relationship between labor and capital. This has helped Shanghai's private industry to develop normally towards the path of state capitalism.
    The general rules for the development of Shanghai's private industry towards state capitalism are: from self-production and self-sales to the low-level form of state capitalism, from the low-level form to the high-level form gradually; from the main factories and main products of the main industries to general factories, general products, and general industries, and gradually expand and improve according to the needs and possibilities of the country. Up to now, industries and products that have been entirely processed, ordered, unified purchased, and exclusively sold by the state include cement, cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, tires, and fountain pens. According to the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce's survey and statistics on the production and sales of Shanghai's private industry in the third quarter of 1953, the average amount of allocation, processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales of 24 kinds of products of large-scale heavy industry (motors, machine tools, cables, steel, electrolytic copper, etc.) and 25 kinds of products of large-scale light industry (cigarettes, paper, caustic soda, vulcanized blue, edible oil, etc.) accounted for about 80 percent of the total quarterly sales [Note 2]. According to the Shanghai Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce's survey and statistics on 66 kinds of private industrial sectors, the output value of their processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales for the state in the third quarter of 1953 accounted for 67.17 percent of the total output value [Note 3]. According to the statistics of the Shanghai purchasing and supply organizations of seven specialized companies, including department stores, cotton yarn and cloth, hardware, and chemicals, their entrusted processing, ordering, unified purchase, exclusive sales and purchase have increased and decreased over the years. In the first half of 1953, the proportion of purchase had dropped to 22.59 percent, and the proportion of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales had risen to 77.41 percent. From the above figures, it can be seen that the main industries and main products of Shanghai's private industry have been mostly or completely processed, ordered, unified purchased, exclusively sold, and purchased by the state. This production exceeded the self-production and self-sales portion of all private industries in Shanghai.
    Before October 1953, there were 66 joint state-private factories in Shanghai. All the facts prove that joint state-private ownership is superior to other forms of state capitalism. Once joint state-private ownership is implemented, the enterprise's outlook is completely renewed. For example, before the joint state-private ownership of the East China Steel Construction Factory in January 1953, production management was very chaotic. The "Five-Anti" movement cleared out the theft of state property amounting to 4.76 billion yuan, and the losses caused by this to the state's projects were even incalculable. After the "Five-Anti" movement, the capitalist side of the factory lacked confidence in engaging in legitimate business to eliminate the "five poisons" behavior. After the joint state-private ownership, the factory's production was significantly improved, and it has made great contributions to the country in the past year. For example, manufacturing equipment for the Sanhe Sluice Project of the Huai River before May 1953 saved more than 26 tons of materials (compared with the original plan, the same below) and saved 4,262 man-days, reducing costs by more than 900 million yuan. There were many moving examples of workers actively finding ways to improve production efficiency -- the production efficiency of each type of work increased by 50 to 600 percent during this period. At present, the number of workers in this factory has increased by nearly two times compared with before the joint state-private ownership. The number of workers in Shanghai Steel Factory No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 has increased by about seven times after the joint state-private ownership.
    Over the past few years, the Shanghai Party and government leading organs have used various forms of state capitalism to utilize, restrict, and transform Shanghai's private industry, and the role it has played is obvious. The first is to develop production, enabling the state to master a large number of products, stabilize prices, and ensure supply. Over the past few years, Shanghai's private industrial production has greatly developed, which is inseparable from the state's leadership, support, and the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation. Last spring, the relevant financial and economic departments in Shanghai conducted a survey of 123 private industrial households in 40 industries. The increase in their turnover was as follows: taking 1950 as 100, 1951 was 163, and 1952 was 156 (due to the "Five-Anti" movement, the turnover was slightly lower than the previous year). In the third quarter of 1953, the turnover of Shanghai's private industry increased by 46.69 percent compared with the same period in 1952. Looking at the development of Shanghai's private textile industry: from partial operation to full operation in the early days of liberation, the output has gradually increased. The annual output of yarn in 1950 was more than 417,700 pieces, and in 1952 it increased to more than 673,500 pieces. The annual output of cloth in 1950 was more than 9.2975 million bolts, and in 1952 it increased to more than 15.5717 million bolts. If calculated based on the country's population of 500 million, the output of Shanghai's private textile industry in 1952 would mean that on average, every 32 people in the country could get one bolt of cloth, and every 730 people could get one piece of yarn. The entrusted processing, ordering, and purchasing business of the China Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station has been expanding day by day. From September to October last year, the monthly cargo transported by water and land to all parts of the country increased from more than 40,000 tons to more than 60,000 tons. Under the help and guidance of the state, Shanghai's private machinery manufacturing industry can already manufacture many products that it could not manufacture in the past, such as complete sets of cotton spinning machines, as well as machine tools, generators, etc. Many products that were previously the object of speculation by speculators -- especially yarn and cloth -- have become genuine means of livelihood and means of production that effectively support the people's livelihood and national construction after being mastered by the state. It must be pointed out that this is the result of the workers' hard work. However, the capitalist side has also shown a positive side here.
    Second, with the development of the state capitalist economy and the increase in production, the state's tax sources have expanded; at the same time, the development of state capitalism also marks the expansion of the state-owned commercial business, creating conditions for the expansion of capital accumulation by state-owned commerce. According to incomplete statistics, the amount of investment in processing, ordering, and purchasing by state-owned specialized companies in Shanghai's private industry, taking 1950 as 100, was about 240 in 1951, about 273 in 1952, and has significantly expanded in 1953 compared with 1952; among them, the amount of cotton cloth received by the cotton yarn and cloth company for processing and ordering, taking 1951 as 100, increased to 216.94 in 1952, and is expected to reach 304.24 in 1953 (calculated in September last year). The expansion of state-owned commercial business, coupled with the continuous improvement of management and administration and the substantial reduction of commodity circulation costs, can accumulate more funds for the state.
    Third, whether it is processing, ordering, unified purchase, exclusive sales, or purchase, public and private parties must negotiate and sign contracts or agreements, and both parties must act in accordance with the contracts or agreements. The capitalist side must deliver goods according to the quantity, quality, and time specified in the contract. The state and the working class directly supervise its production. In this way, the capitalist's past unlimited pursuit of high profits, and the resulting "five poisons" behavior, has been restricted and banned, and the capitalist's management style and the nature of the enterprise have been initially transformed. Since joint state-private enterprises are under the direct leadership and control of the state, the capitalist side has more opportunities to be educated and transformed, and it is also more thorough than the former.
    This transformation is beneficial to the capitalist side. Still taking the aforementioned survey of 123 private industrial households as an example, the capitalist side has continuously increased machines to expand reproduction based on the increase in its turnover. Fixed assets in 1951 increased by 3.4 percent compared with 1950, and in 1952 increased by 4.6 percent compared with 1951. Shanghai's industry and commerce have had large surpluses over the years, and the surplus in 1953 was even greater than in 1952. According to a survey of 615 industrial and commercial households in 81 industries, 606 households had surpluses from January to September 1953. Both the number of households with surpluses and the amount of surplus increased compared with the same period in 1952. Joint state-private enterprises have even faster production and surplus growth.
    Over the past few years, Shanghai's private industry has played its positive role in the process of gradual transformation. However, due to the nature of its pursuit of profit, the "five poisons" behavior to varying degrees is still quite common. In August and September last year, the Shanghai Tax Bureau inspected 1,386 industrial and commercial households, of which 1,126 households evaded taxes, accounting for 81 percent of the inspected households. Once the peak season arrives, many private industrial households (especially in the daily necessities industry) that accept state-entrusted processing and ordering will get rid of processing and ordering, or use state funds to delay delivery, or cut corners and manufacture shoddy products. Therefore, for private factories that do not yet have the conditions for joint state-private ownership, in the future, in continuing to entrust them with processing or ordering, unified purchasing, exclusive sales, and purchasing from them, we should further mobilize workers to supervise the capitalist side's production to ensure that products are completed according to quality, quantity, and time. The excessively high or low labor profit should be reasonably adjusted. According to needs and possibilities, the scope of state processing, ordering, unified purchasing, exclusive sales, and purchasing should also be gradually expanded in the future.
    The situation in Shanghai fully illustrates that joint state-private enterprises are superior to other forms of state capitalism enterprises, but the number is still too small. In 1952, the output value of the two types of enterprises, joint state-private factories and handicraft production cooperatives, accounted for only 5.7 percent of Shanghai's total output value in that year [Note 4]. Although there has been some development in 1953, the proportion is still relatively small, so it must be gradually expanded. First of all, the hardware and textile industries, which have a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, should be further developed towards joint state-private ownership. Some of these enterprises process and order for the state entirely, and some process and order for the state mostly, but the output and quality of the products are both low (the Shanghai Textile Industry Union's survey of 42 private cotton spinning mills in October last year showed that on average, each spindle produced 1.0142 pounds of 20-count yarn in 20 hours; the average quality of yarn produced by 38 private cotton spinning mills was 68 points, which is grade C yarn, while the average quality of yarn produced by state-owned factories was above 80 points, which is grade A yarn, and the output was also much higher than that of private cotton spinning mills; The machines produced by private machinery factories are generally old-fashioned and do not meet the country's requirements), and the consumption of raw materials is large, causing great waste of the state's human and material resources. At the same time, the serious delays in delivery of these enterprises (especially the machinery manufacturing industry) are disrupting the state's established plans. These problems cannot be solved without further changing the production relations of these enterprises, which is what the broad masses of workers and far-sighted capitalists have seen. Since the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China led the city to launch the study of the general line of the transition period last winter, the broad masses of workers have welcomed the socialist transformation of private enterprises with infinite excitement, and some capitalists have also expressed their active efforts to have their enterprises implement joint state-private ownership as soon as possible. This spirit is very good. However, it must be repeatedly pointed out that the transformation of private industry and commerce must be led, gradual, and planned.
    Some people still have some unnecessary concerns. Some people are worried about whether there will be any profit. All the aforementioned facts indicate that Shanghai's private industry would not have today's development without the support and leadership of the state and without cooperation with the state-owned economy. Therefore, this concern is unfounded. Some people are worried about the issue of ownership and management rights of enterprises. Of course, after entering socialist society, all means of production should be owned by the state and the people, but during the considerable long transition period before entering socialist society, there is no doubt that private ownership of the means of production will still be preserved. The property of joint state-private enterprises is jointly owned by both parties according to public and private funds. The management of joint state-private enterprises is also under the direct leadership of the state, and the state unites with the capitalist side to jointly manage. In joint state-private enterprises, the enthusiasm of all personnel participating in production and production management can be developed, and all opinions that are beneficial to production can be adopted. However, the so-called "management rights" that are divorced from production are meaningless, and the "interests" that are divorced from production do not exist. The state will handle the valuation of the original enterprise assets at the time of joint ownership in a fair and reasonable manner based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. Some senior staff, and even some workers, are worried about adjusting wages, benefits, and work after joint ownership. In fact, this should not be a concern either. The state has always cared about the lives of employees, and the lives of employees in Shanghai have been continuously improving since liberation. However, in order to improve the level of material and cultural life, we must first do a good job in production, improve enterprise management, and continuously eliminate unreasonable phenomena; it is wrong to be satisfied with the status quo in production and stop moving forward, but to demand an increase in material benefits. Immediate interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, individual interests should be subordinate to overall interests, people's work should be subordinate to the needs of production, and the improvement of life must never exceed the improvement of production. All phenomena that violate these principles should be corrected. Only in this way can we enter socialism faster and live a happier life.

    四年来上海私营工业的改造
    本报记者　艾方
    上海的工业生产对国家工业化和人民生活起着重大的作用。
    上海私营工业的比重很大。就纺织业的设备说，上海的二百三十五万左右的纱锭中，私营纱厂占一百一十八万锭左右。染织、机器和生产日用百货的各行各业，私营工厂占的比重更大。据一九五三年统计，上海私营工业的产值占上海工业总产值的百分之六十三点三九〔注一〕——加工、订货、统购、包销的产值在内。若将这一部分产值剔除，投向自由市场的私营工厂的产值仅占百分之二十六点八八。当然，这只是就私营工业的数量来说。从质量上看，它是不能和社会主义性质的国营工业相比的。这个数量情况指明，利用、限制、改造上海的私营工业的任务，在过去和将来的一个时期——整个社会主义改造时期——都是一项重大的、艰巨的任务。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，上海党政领导机关在执行利用、限制、改造私营工业上做了一系列的工作。解放之后，上海这种过去在帝国主义和官僚资本长期统治下形成的一切矛盾和反常现象，就完全暴露出来。原来原料完全依靠帝国主义，或者销路在国外，或者销路、原料都在国外的私营工业，当着遭到美国强盗的封锁、轰炸的时候，就陷于停顿、半停顿状态。物价渐趋稳定的时候，基于通货膨胀和投机而来的市面虚假繁荣消失了，出现了市场上暂时的清淡和呆滞。在这种情况之下，凡于国计民生无利的、或于国计民生关系不大的，不能为国家利用、或不能为国家广泛利用的私营企业，如大旅馆、大菜馆、转手牟利的批发商、高级时装店等等，大量地倒下去了。对一切与国计民生密切相关的企业，人民政府采取了一切有效措施——贷款，大力发展经济作物的生产，发展交通、畅通城乡物资交流，扩大加工、订货和收购，——解决它生产中所遇到的一切困难。一九五一年全国市场空前繁荣，上海私营工商业者“五毒”泛滥，一九五二年人民政府领导广大人民反对私营工商业者的“五毒”行为，展开了“五反”运动；“五反”运动中，政府在经济上给予私营工业很多照顾，继续并在某些方面扩大了加工、订货。国家并不断地调整了公私关系和劳资关系。这样就帮助了上海的私营工业向着国家资本主义道路正常发展。
    上海私营工业向国家资本主义发展，一般规律是：由自产自销到国家资本主义的低级形式，由低级形式再逐渐到高级形式；由主要行业的主要工厂、主要产品，向一般工厂、一般产品、一般行业发展，并根据国家的需要与可能，逐步扩大和提高。到目前为止，已经全部为国家加工、订货、统购、包销的行业、产品，有水泥、棉纺、染织、轮胎、金笔等。据上海市工商局对上海私营工业一九五三年第三季度产销情况的调查统计，大型重工业的二十四种产品（电机、车床、电缆、钢材、电铜等等），大型轻工业的二十五种产品（卷烟、纸张、烧碱、硫化青、食油等等），其拨付加工、订货、统购、包销的数量，平均占全季营业总量的百分之八十左右〔注二〕。另据上海市工商局对六十六种私营工业行业的调查统计，它们在一九五三年第三季度为国家加工、订货、统购、包销的产值，占总产值的百分之六十七点一七〔注三〕。再据百货、花纱布、五金、化工等七个专业公司的上海采购供应机构的统计，它们委托加工、订货、统购、包销和收购的情况，几年以来互有消长，一九五三年上半年，收购所占比重已降至百分之二十二点五九，加工、订货、统购、包销的比重已上升至百分之七十七点四一。从上述数字可以看出，上海私营工业的主要行业、主要产品已经大部或全部为国家加工、订货、统购、包销和收购。这项生产超过了上海全部私营工业的自产自销部分。
    上海公私合营的工厂一九五三年十月前已有六十六家。所有的事实都证明，公私合营优于国家资本主义其他形式，一经公私合营之后，企业面貌就为之一新。例如华东钢铁建筑厂在一九五三年一月合营之前，生产管理十分混乱，“五反”中清算出盗窃国家资财达四十七亿六千多万元，由此而造成的国家工程上的损失更无法计算。“五反”后，该厂资方曾对消除“五毒”行为从事正当经营缺乏信心。公私合营后，该厂生产显著改进，一年来对国家有很大贡献。只一九五三年五月前为淮河三河闸工程制造器材，就节约材料二十六吨多（较原计划，下同），节约人工四千二百六十二个，共降低成本九亿多元，出现了很多工人积极找窍门、挖潜力，提高生产效率——各工种在这期间提高生产效率百分之五十至百分之六百不等——的动人事例。目前这个工厂工人数已比合营前增加近两倍。上海钢铁一、二、三厂，合营后工人则增加七倍左右。
    几年以来，上海的党政领导机关通过国家资本主义的各种形式，对上海私营工业进行利用、限制和改造所起的作用是明显的。首先是发展了生产，使国家掌握了大量的产品，稳定了物价，保证了供应。几年以来，上海的私营工业生产有了很大的发展，这和国家的领导、扶持和利用、限制、改造的方针是分不开的。去年春天，上海有关财经部门对四十个行业一百二十三家私营工业户进行了调查，其营业额的上升情况是：以一九五○年为一○○，一九五一年为一六三，一九五二年为一五六（因“五反”运动，较上年营业额稍有下降）。一九五三年第三季度上海私营工业营业额较一九五二年同期增百分之四十六点六九。从上海私营纺织业的发展来看：由解放初期的部分开工到全部开工，产量逐步提高，纱一九五○年年产四十一万七千七百多件，一九五二年提高到年产六十七万三千五百多件，布一九五○年年产九百二十九万七千五百多匹，一九五二年提高到一千五百五十七万一千七百多匹。如果以全国五亿人口计算，上海私营纺织业一九五二年的产量，平均全国每三十二人左右可得到一匹布、七百三十人左右可得到一件纱。中国百货公司上海采购供应站委托加工和订货、收购业务日益扩大，去年九、十月份每月由水陆交通运往全国各地的货物自四万多吨增加到六万多吨。上海的私营机器制造业在国家帮助和指导下，已经可以制造很多过去所不能制造的产品，如整套的棉纺机，以及工作母机、发电机等。很多过去是作为投机者的投机对象的产品——特别是纱布，为国家掌握之后，即变为有效支援人民生活和国家建设的、名符其实的生活资料和生产资料。必须指出，这是工人努力生产的结果。但资方在这里也表现了积极性的一面。
    第二，随着国家资本主义经济的发展。生产的上升，国家税源扩大了；同时国家资本主义的发展，也标志着国营商业业务的扩大，给国营商业扩大资金积累创造了条件。据不完全的统计，国营各专业公司对上海私营工业加工、订货和收购的投放额以一九五○年为一○○，一九五一年约为二四○，一九五二年约为二七三，一九五三年较一九五二年又有显著扩大；其中花纱布公司以一九五一年加工、订货的棉布收进量为一○○，一九五二年提高到二一六点九四，一九五三年预计可达三○四点二四（去年九月计算）。国营商业业务扩大，加上不断改进经营管理，切实降低商品流转费用，就能为国家积累更多的资金。
    第三，无论加工、订货、统购、包销和收购，公私协商订立合同或协议，双方必须按合同或协议办事。资方必须按合同规定的数量、质量和时间交货。国家和工人阶级直接监督其生产。这样，资方过去的那种无限制的追求高额利润，以及由此而产生的“五毒”行为就受到了限制、取缔，资方的经营作风和企业的性质也得到初步改造。公私合营企业由于在国家直接领导和掌握之下，资方所受到的教育和改造的机会就更多，也较前者为彻底。
    这种改造对资方是有好处的。仍以前述对一二三户私营工业户的调查为例，资方在其营业额上升的基础上，不断增加机器扩大再生产。一九五一年的固定资产较一九五○年增百分之三点四，一九五二年较一九五一年增百分之四点六。上海工商业历年来都有很大盈余，一九五三年盈余又大于一九五二年。据八十一个行业六百十五户工商业的调查，一九五三年一至九月，盈余的有六百零六户。盈余户数和金额较一九五二年同期都有增长。公私合营企业生产和盈余增长更快。
    几年以来上海私营工业在逐步改造中，发挥了它积极性的一面。但由于其唯利是图的本质作怪，程度不等的“五毒”行为还是相当普遍的。去年八、九月间上海税局检查了一三八六家工商业户，其中偷税、漏税的就有一一二六户，偷漏户占被检查户的百分之八十一。旺季一到，很多接受国家委托加工、订货的私营工业户（特别是日用百货业），就摆脱加工、订货，或套用国家资金延期交货，或偷工减料粗制滥造。因此，对于一时还不具备合营条件的私营工厂，今后在继续委托其加工或向其订货、统购、包销和收购中，应进一步发动工人监督资方生产，以保证产品按质、按量、按时完成。工缴利润偏高偏低的，应合理调整。根据需要与可能，今后国家加工、订货、统购、包销和收购的范围，也应逐步扩大。
    上海的情况充分说明了公私合营企业优于国家资本主义其他形式的企业，但目前数量还太少。一九五二年上海公私合营厂和手工业生产合作社两种企业的产值，仅为上海当年生产总值的百分之五点七〔注四〕，一九五三年虽有了一些发展，但所占比重还是较小的，因此必须逐步扩大。首先，对国计民生影响重大的五金、纺织两大行业，应进一步向公私合营发展。这些企业有的全部、有的大部为国家进行加工订货，但产品的产量质量均低（上海纺织业工会去年十月间对四十二个私营棉纺厂的调查，平均每一枚锭子二十小时产二十支纱一点零一四二磅；三十八个私营棉纺厂纱的质量平均六十八分，是丙级纱，而国营厂所产纱质量平均八十分以上，是甲级纱，产量也高出私营纱厂产量很多，私营机器厂所产机器一般式样老，不合国家要求），原材料消耗大，造成国家人力、物力的很大浪费。同时，这些企业的严重脱期交货（特别是机器制造业），破坏着国家既定的计划。这些企业的生产关系不进一步改变，这些问题将无法解决，这是广大工人以及有远见的资本家都看到了的。去年冬季，中共上海市委领导全市展开过渡时期总路线的学习以来，广大工人都以无限兴奋的心情来迎接对私营企业的社会主义改造，有的资方也表示积极争取自己的企业早日实行公私合营，这种精神是很好的。但必须再三指出，对私营工商业的改造是要有领导的、逐步的、有计划的前进。
    有些人还有一些多余的担心。有人担心是否有利可得。前述一切事实指明，上海的私营工业离开国家的扶持、领导，离开和国营经济的合作，是不会有今天的发展的。因此这种担心是没有根据的。有的人担心企业的所有权和管理权问题。当然，进入社会主义社会以后，一切生产资料应归国家和人民所有，但在进入社会主义社会之前相当长的过渡时期内，生产资料私有权仍然保存，则是无可怀疑的。公私合营企业的财产，按照公私资金为双方共有。公私合营企业的管理，也是在国家直接领导下，国家团结资方共同管理。在公私合营的企业里，一切参加生产和参加生产管理的人员的积极性可以发扬出来，一切有益于生产的意见都可以被采纳。但是，一切脱离开生产的所谓“管理权”是没有意义的，脱离开生产的“利益”也是不存在的。合营时原有企业资产的估价问题，国家会以公平合理的原则实事求是地加以处理。有的高级职员、甚至有的工人，担心合营后要调整工资、福利、工作，其实，这也不应过虑。国家一向是关心职工生活的，上海解放以来，职工生活不断提高。但为了提高物质文化生活水平，首先必须搞好生产，必须改进企业管理，不断消灭不合理现象；满足于生产上的现状、停止不前，却要求提高物质福利，是错误的。眼前利益应服从长远利益，个人利益应服从整体利益，人的工作应服从生产的需要，生活的改善绝不能超过生产的提高。一切和这些原则相违反的现象都应纠正。只有这样才能更快地进入社会主义，过更幸福的生活。
