    The Radiance of Stalin's Teachings Illuminates Us
    Li Siguang
    Comrade Stalin, the revolutionary teacher and dearest friend of people all over the world, and the standard-bearer of the world peace movement, has passed away for a year.

    Over the past year, peace-loving people all over the world have advanced bravely along the direction indicated by Stalin during his lifetime, and have achieved great achievements. Under the blows of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and under the pressure of peace-loving people all over the world, the American imperialists had no choice but to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. This great victory fully proved Stalin's prediction in 1951: "If Britain and the United States finally reject the peaceful proposals of the Chinese People's Government, then the Korean War can only end in the defeat of the interventionists." Although the American imperialists are still unwilling to accept defeat, expanding their armaments and preparing for war, and continuing to create tense situations in Asia and other parts of the world, as long as we remain highly vigilant and unswervingly implement Comrade Stalin's spirit of safeguarding world peace, and unite peace-loving people all over the world, we have the confidence to smash any conspiracies and provocations of the aggressors.

    Over the past year, with the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet government, the Chinese people have made great achievements in national construction. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, we have recently conducted extensive study of the general line of the state's transition period. Through this study, we have more deeply realized the correctness of Lenin and Stalin's theory of the transition period. We must follow the path of industrialization pointed out to us by Stalin—first developing heavy industry, and taking the Soviet Union as an example to build our motherland into a beautiful socialist country.

    To commemorate the great teacher, we must strive to study Stalin's classic works to improve our level of ideological understanding. Chinese scientific workers have studied "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" and criticized the erroneous views of idealism and mechanical materialism in scientific work. Stalin's great classic works "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" and "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" are examples of scientific research. In these two works, Stalin not only teaches us how to understand the difference and connection between superstructure and base, and the characteristics of natural science and social science, but also teaches us how we should treat science and how to carry out scientific research work. As long as Chinese scientific workers study Stalin's great works in depth, understand their essence, and apply them specifically to our practical work, we will surely be able to exert greater strength in the cause of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and achieve creative development in our country's scientific undertakings.

    斯大林学说的光辉照耀着我们
    李四光
    全世界人民的革命导师、最亲挚的朋友、世界和平运动的旗手斯大林同志，逝世已经一周年了。
    一年来，全世界爱好和平的人民沿着斯大林生前指示的方向，英勇前进，取得了巨大的成就。美帝国主义者在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的打击之下，在全世界爱好和平人民的逼迫下，不得不在朝鲜停战协定上签了字。这一伟大的胜利，完全证明了斯大林在一九五一年的预言：“如果英国和美国终于拒绝了中国人民政府的和平建议，那么朝鲜战争便只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”虽然美帝国主义者仍不甘心于失败，扩军备战，在亚洲及世界其他各地继续制造紧张局势，但只要我们保持高度警惕，始终坚持不渝地贯彻斯大林同志维护世界和平的精神，团结全世界爱好和平的人民，我们有信心粉碎侵略者的任何阴谋和挑衅。
    一年来，在苏联政府的伟大无私的帮助下，中国人民在国家建设方面取得了极大的成就。在中国共产党中央和毛泽东主席的领导下，我们在最近广泛地进行了关于国家过渡时期总路线的学习。通过这次学习，我们更深刻地体会到列宁、斯大林的过渡时期理论的正确性。我们一定要走斯大林给我们指出的工业化道路——首先发展重工业，以苏联为榜样把我们的祖国建设成为一个美好的社会主义国家。
    纪念伟大的导师，我们要努力学习斯大林的经典著作，来提高我们的思想认识水平。中国科学工作者学习了“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”，批判了科学工作中的唯心论和机械唯物论的错误观点。斯大林的伟大经典著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”和“马克思主义与语言学问题”，是科学研究的范例。在这两部著作中，斯大林不仅教导我们如何去认识上层建筑与基础的区别和联系，认识自然科学和社会科学的特点，而且教导我们应该如何对待科学和怎样进行科学研究工作。中国科学工作者只要深入学习斯大林的伟大著作，体会其精神实质，并把它具体地运用到我们的实际工作中去，我们一定能够在国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业中发挥更大的力量，在我国科学事业中获得创造性的发展。
