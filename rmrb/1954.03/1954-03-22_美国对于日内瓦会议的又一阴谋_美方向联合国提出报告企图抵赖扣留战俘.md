Another Conspiracy by the United States Regarding the Geneva Conference

The U.S. Submits a Report to the UN Attempting to Deny Responsibility for Detaining Prisoners of War

The U.S. government submitted a report on March 18th to the United Nations from the so-called "United Nations Command" regarding the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in Korea. The crime of the U.S. in violating the prisoner of war agreement and forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has been confirmed and determined by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. For this matter alone, the U.S. ruling group is already an undeniable criminal in the court of world public opinion. Now, after a long period of planning and painstaking effort, the U.S. has put forward this report, the purpose of which is clearly to prepare in advance to make a hopeless denial of the U.S.'s crime of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war at the upcoming Geneva Conference and to shirk the responsibility that the U.S. must bear. As Reuters reported very clearly: "This document may become a basic document at the Geneva Conference on April 26th," "One reason the United Nations Command is submitting the report at this time is to pre-empt the attacks made in the final report of the majority of the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, reportedly signed by India, Czechoslovakia, and Poland."

However, this report presented by the U.S. offers nothing other than repeating the old tricks of empty denials and reversing right and wrong, and it offers nothing to answer the ironclad evidence of the U.S.'s forcible detention of prisoners of war, which has been presented by the Korean and Chinese side and confirmed by the neutral nations. Even Reuters' report admits that the U.S. report contains nothing new, "The facts recorded therein (?) have all been reported before." This report is yet another product of the U.S.'s attempt to tamper with history. It is obvious that the U.S.'s attempt to use such a "magic weapon" to cover up its shame in front of international public opinion will not only fail to achieve its purpose, but will only make the crime of the U.S. authorities in forcibly detaining prisoners of war even more odious.

In this report, the U.S. authorities describe the more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained as having obtained "a real opportunity for free choice" and flatly deny the well-known series of facts about the U.S. sending special agents, threatening and killing prisoners of war, sabotaging explanations, and preventing repatriation. However, the whole world already knows that the U.S.'s "free choice" is only a synonym for "forced detention." Only a month ago, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission issued its "Final Report," which further established the fact that the U.S. used special agents to sabotage explanations, prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war, and forcibly detain them. The conclusion of the "Final Report" emphasized: "The prisoner organizations and the leaders who presided over these organizations set up by U.S. agents in the prisoner of war camps negate all assumptions or vain words about free choice." "The Committee must frankly state its belief, based on its own experience, that to believe that these prisoners of war have voluntarily chosen not to be repatriated without more fully and further implementing the 'Terms of Reference' is a vain word supported by no evidence whatsoever." The report pointed out that under the obstruction of U.S. agents, only a small number of prisoners of war risked their lives to exercise their right to be repatriated, and some prisoners of war were killed by special agents because they hoped to be repatriated. The report also pointed out that the fear and influence spread by U.S. agents in the prisoner of war camps "still existed until the end." The report emphasized: "It must be reiterated that this Committee and the Indian Custodial Force have experienced too much of the existence of this fear." The U.S. in its report dares not say a word about the facts and clear judgments that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has announced to the world, but only seizes on the so-called dissenting opinions of the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, who have repeatedly tried to cover up the U.S.'s crimes, as a shield. However, the evidence of U.S. agents using violence to control prisoners of war and obstructing repatriation cannot be completely covered up even by the Swiss and Swedish members. As early as the end of last year, the "Individual Reports" issued by the Swiss and Swedish members had already admitted that the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri were under the control of powerful terrorist organizations, that the prisoners of war who requested repatriation "risked their lives," and that "several murders had occurred" in the camps. When Swedish member Major General Stenstroem arrived in Bombay on March 10th on his way back to Sweden from Korea, he publicly admitted to reporters that Americans had instigated special agents to murder prisoners of war who requested repatriation. He said that some Americans "had a great relationship with some disturbances in the prisoner of war camps, which cannot be completely denied. Some of these Americans had tried to indoctrinate the prisoners of war, resulting in murders in the prisoner of war camps."

The bloody and brutal truth of the U.S.'s forced detention of prisoners of war has long been nakedly exposed, but the self-deceiving American Cold War experts are still saying in the report submitted to the United Nations that the more than 20,000 prisoners of war abducted by the U.S. have "chosen freedom" and "found refuge in the free world." However, lies cannot cover people's eyes after all. Everyone knows that these prisoners of war have suffered hardships under the dark rule of U.S. agents and have been forcibly escorted to South Korea under the threat and surveillance of U.S. aircraft, tanks, and armed forces. The tragic scene of prisoners of war with gloomy faces and silent words being forced to march south from Dongchang-ri to Munsan has even been revealed in the writings of many U.S. journalists. The "refuge in the free world" prepared for them by the U.S. is the conscription station of Syngman Rhee and the concentration camp of the Kuomintang bandit gang. The American authorities, who are full of "humanitarianism," have thus deprived the prisoners of war of all rights to return to their homeland and live a peaceful life. The U.S.'s nonsense about prisoners of war "choosing freedom" cannot but arouse the indignation of all just people. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once said after the U.S. hijacked the prisoners of war: "It is said that their prisoners have been freed, but I simply cannot see what freedom they have in sending these prisoners of war to countries where they cannot act according to their own wishes at all."

It is very obvious that the U.S. is attempting to use such an ugly document to maintain the already exposed "voluntary repatriation" hoax in order to conceal its hands stained with the blood of prisoners of war, which is impossible to achieve. The Korean and Chinese people have solemnly declared long ago that the U.S. has the full responsibility at all times for the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war it forcibly detains to be fully recovered and accounted for. It is impossible for the U.S. ruling group to escape from the court of world public opinion.

### 美国对于日内瓦会议的又一阴谋  美方向联合国提出报告企图抵赖扣留战俘

    美国对于日内瓦会议的又一阴谋
    美方向联合国提出报告企图抵赖扣留战俘
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国政府在三月十八日把所谓“联合国军司令部”关于朝鲜的战俘遣返问题的一份报告提交联合国。美方破坏战俘问题协议、强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪行已经为中立国遣返委员会所证实和确定了。仅仅为了这件事，美国统治集团就已经是世界公正舆论审判庭上无可抵赖的罪人。现在美方经过长时期筹划而煞费心机地提出这一份报告，其目的显然是为了预先作好准备，以便在即将到来的日内瓦会议上对美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪行再作毫无希望的抵赖，推卸美方所必须担负的责任。路透社的报道说得很明显：“这个文件可能成为四月二十六日日内瓦会议上的一个基本文件”，“联合国军在这个时候提出报告的一个原因，是要预先阻止据说由印度、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰签署的中立国遣返委员会的多数委员的最后报告里所提出的抨击”。
    但是，美方提出的这个报告除了重复老一套的空口抵赖、颠倒是非的伎俩以外，拿不出任何东西来答复朝中方面所提出的中立国方面所肯定的美方强迫扣留战俘的铁的罪证。连路透社的报道也承认美方报告毫无新鲜之处，“其中所记载的事实
  （？）已在以前全部报道过了”。这个报告是美方又一次企图窜改历史的文件的产品。美方要靠这样的一个“法宝”来替自己在国际舆论面前遮羞，显然不但不能达到目的，而且只有使美国当局强迫扣留战俘的罪行更加臭气薰天。
    美国当局在这份报告中把强迫扣留下来的两万多名朝中战俘说成是获得了“真正自由选择的机会”，并矢口否认众所周知的美方派遣特务、威胁和杀害战俘、破坏解释、阻止遣返的一连串事实。但是，全世界都已知道，美方的“自由选择”只不过是“强迫扣留”的同义语。仅仅在一个月以前，中立国遣返委员会发表了“最后报告”，对美方利用特务破坏解释、阻止战俘遣返并加以强迫扣留的事实进一步作出了定论。“最后报告”的结论强调：美方特务在战俘营中布置的“战俘组织及主持这些组织的领袖否定了关于自由选择的一切假设或妄言。”
  “本委员会必须坦白陈述其以自己的经验为基础的信念，即若不更充分与进一步地执行‘职权范围’而认为这些战俘已自愿选择了不遣返的说法，都是毫无任何证据作支持的妄言”。这个报告指出：在美方特务阻挠遣返下，只有一小部分战俘冒着生命危险行使了被遣返的权利，若干战俘由于希望遣返而被特务杀害。报告还指出，美方特务在战俘营中散布的恐惧和影响“直到最后还是存在着的”。报告强调指出：“必须重新申说的是，本委员会与印度看管部队对这种恐惧的存在是经验得太多了。”美方在其报告中对中立国遣返委员会向全世界公布的事实和明确的判断不敢置一辞，而只有抓住替美方罪行多方掩饰的中立国遣返委员会的瑞士、瑞典委员的所谓不同意见来作挡箭牌，但是美方特务以暴力控制战俘、阻挠遣返的罪证，连瑞士、瑞典委员也无法全部加以掩盖，早在去年年终，瑞士、瑞典委员发表的“个别报告”就已承认东场里战俘处于强有力的恐怖组织的控制之下，要求遣返的战俘“冒着生命危险”，在营场中“曾发生了好几起凶杀案”。瑞典委员斯坦斯特鲁少将在三月十日从朝鲜返国途中到达孟买时，并曾对记者公开承认美国人指使特务谋杀要求遣返的战俘。他说，有一些美国人“和一些战俘营中的骚扰有很大关系，这一点是不能完全否认的。这些美国人当中有些人曾试图向战俘进行思想灌输，结果造成了战俘营中的谋杀事件”。
    美方强迫扣留战俘的血腥的残暴的真相，早已赤裸裸地暴露了出来，但是自欺欺人的美国冷战专家们居然还在提交联合国的报告里说什么两万多名被美方押走的战俘已经“选择了自由”，“在自由世界里找到了避难所”。但是，谎话毕竟遮不住人们的眼睛。谁都知道，这些战俘在美方特务的暗无天日的统治下历尽苦难之后又在美国飞机、坦克、武装部队的威胁和监视之下被强迫押解到南朝鲜，从东场里到汶山，愁容满面、默然无语的战俘被迫南行的悲惨景象，甚至在美方新闻记者的笔下也有过不少的透露。美方替他们准备好的“自由世界的避难所”就是李承晚的征兵站和国民党匪帮的集中营，满口“人道主义”的美国当局就这样剥夺了战俘返回祖国和过和平生活的一切权利。美方关于战俘“选择了自由”的鬼话，不能不使一切公正的人士感到愤慨。印度尼赫鲁总理在美方劫走战俘之后就曾经表示：“据说他们的俘虏已经得到自由，但是把这些战俘送到那些他们丝毫不能按照他们自己的愿望行事的国家去，我简直看不出他们有什么自由。”
    十分明显，美方企图利用这样一个丑恶的文件把早已拆穿的“自愿遣返”的骗局保持下去，以便掩饰它染满战俘鲜血的双手，这是万难实现的。朝中人民早已郑重声明，美方对于它所强迫扣留的朝中战俘，在任何时候都负有全部追回、并提出交代的责任。美国统治集团想要从世界公正舆论的审判庭上逃走是不可能的。
