Actively Lead Rural Women to Participate in the Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
Zhang Yun, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

Under the illumination of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, the central task of women's work in rural areas is to mobilize and educate the broad masses of rural women to participate in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, in order to promote agricultural collectivization, gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state, improve agricultural productivity, increase crop yields, and provide more grain and raw material crops needed for the socialist industrialization endeavor; and on this basis, improve the social status of rural women and gradually realize the complete liberation of rural women.

Agricultural collectivization is the only way for the state to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and it is also the only way to gradually create a social and economic system for the complete liberation of rural women. Facts have proved that the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement has opened up broad avenues for the vast number of women to participate in agricultural production. Where the mutual aid and cooperation movement is done well, it can mobilize a large number of women to participate in agricultural production. Moreover, the more the mutual aid and cooperation organizations develop and gradually improve, the more conditions there are to attract more women to participate in mutual aid labor. For example, agricultural production cooperatives can attract more women to participate in agricultural production than mutual aid teams. Many excellent agricultural production cooperatives, in order to greatly increase production, have adopted advanced farming methods to varying degrees, carried out intensive farming and land processing, and developed sideline occupations to serve agricultural production. As a result, the demand for labor has increased, and it is difficult to complete the task of increasing production in a timely manner relying solely on male labor. The need for women to participate in agricultural labor has also increased. Moreover, because agricultural production cooperatives have a relatively reasonable distribution system, they can solve the problem of women's labor remuneration more rationally. At the same time, in collective labor, due to the principle of division of labor and specialization in the use of female labor, it is possible to better take care of the special difficulties of women, so that women can give full play to their strengths in production. Therefore, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production needs women to participate in labor more and more, and the possibility and enthusiasm of women to participate in agricultural production are also increasing day by day, and the number of women participating in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative production is also increasing year by year. In many better agricultural production cooperatives, the number of working days for women generally accounts for about 20 to 30 percent of the total number of working days. Because of this, agricultural production cooperatives have sufficient labor, and male and female peasants cooperate in the division of labor, which has the power to cultivate in a timely manner, reduce natural disasters, carry out agricultural basic construction and technological reforms, and promote agricultural production. At the same time, it also has the power to develop sideline and handicraft industries that are closely related to agricultural production and can promote agricultural production, which improves the production of cooperatives and increases the income of the members. Therefore, mobilizing women to participate in mutual aid and cooperative production is an important condition for developing and consolidating mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives and giving full play to their advantages. At the same time, because women participate in collective labor, their socialist consciousness is also improved, and they gradually overcome phenomena such as "dragging their feet," causing disunity, and not actively working. Now many women ask to join agricultural production cooperatives because they understand the truth that "cooperatives are large families, and only when large families increase production can small families become prosperous" and "we can only work hard, and the happy life of socialism can come sooner." Women's love for mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and collective labor is very helpful to the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state. Due to the significant role of women in developing agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, coupled with the fact that mutual aid teams have implemented the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, and agricultural production cooperatives have implemented a more reasonable distribution system, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have implemented to varying degrees the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women according to the quantity and quality of the work, thereby further improving the economic status of women, changing the tradition of discrimination and abuse against women in the old society, and the material and cultural life of women has improved with it, and their social and political status has also increased.

However, from a national perspective, due to the uneven development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in various regions and the lack of widespread and in-depth work among rural women in many regions, the participation of women in mutual aid and cooperative production is also extremely uneven. The majority of women still only work in their own fields or at home, and only a few participate in the labor of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. In mutual aid teams, the phenomenon of "men helping each other, women working alone" is widespread. Spontaneous capitalist ideas are growing among some rural women, and the vast majority of women still have feudal inferiority complexes. In many mutual aid team members and cooperative members, there are still ideas that discriminate against women, who are unwilling to absorb women's participation, or give different pay for the same work, which affects the enthusiasm of women to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and also affects the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

Therefore, when commemorating the "March 8" International Women's Day this year, when the people of the whole country are concentrating their efforts to implement the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, we suggest that the party and government leading organs and democratic women's federations at all levels working in rural areas should seriously examine rural women's work, summarize experiences and lessons, and more actively lead rural women to participate in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that rural women's work and the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement can advance steadily accordingly. The resolution of the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930 once charged all party, trade union, Soviet and other organizations with "strengthening their own work of mobilizing the broad masses of working women, especially rural women, to carry out socialist construction." At the same time, it pointed out: "Bringing the work among the poor peasants, women, and youth in collective farms to the height it deserves - all this has become a necessary prerequisite for the party to successfully carry out the socialist transformation in agriculture." When talking about mobilizing workers to participate in economic construction work, Lenin instructed: "This work started by the Soviet regime can only be advanced when millions of women, not hundreds of women, participate in this work throughout Russia. At that time, we believe that the cause of socialist construction will be unbreakable." (The tasks of the women workers' movement of the Soviet Republic) These instructions are equally applicable to the socialist transformation of agriculture that we are carrying out. Without the active participation of millions of rural women, the completion of this transformation is unimaginable.

According to the experience of some regions, in order to mobilize women to participate in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the principle of mobilizing both men and women must be consistently and conscientiously implemented in leadership, and attention must be paid to the following aspects:

First, in combination with production, it is necessary to regularly conduct ideological education on the general line and policy education on mutual aid and cooperation among women, improve their socialist consciousness, make them love the motherland, love socialism, love mutual aid teams and cooperatives, love labor, love public property, and help them overcome spontaneous capitalist ideas and various specific manifestations; make them understand that working alone has no way out, and if they continue to work alone for a long time, the majority of peasants will fall back into poverty, and the broad masses of rural women will not be able to obtain their own liberation; only by realizing agricultural collectivization and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture can the needs of the state be met, the increasing prosperity of all peasants can be guaranteed, and the complete liberation of rural women can be guaranteed. To this end, it is necessary to respect women's democratic rights in the cooperative and team, in addition to attracting them to participate in important meetings and studies of the cooperative and team, and to hold women's meetings and family meetings in accordance with the living conditions of women, to conduct more in-depth education for women.

Second, adhere to the principle of "men and women labor should implement the same remuneration according to the quality and quantity of work" proposed in the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" in order to improve women's production enthusiasm and love for cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and stimulate their love for socialism. Article 122 of the Soviet Constitution regards the right of women to obtain work and labor remuneration equally with men as the primary condition for guaranteeing the realization of equality between men and women. Comrade Stalin clearly instructed: "Under the labor day system, everything is equal, there is no distinction between women and men. Whoever makes more labor days earns more wages. Collective farms liberate women by implementing the labor day work system and turn them into independent people." Therefore, from the point of view of production or from the point of view of women's liberation, the principle of equal pay for equal work should be implemented. Some mutual aid teams, where few women participate in mutual aid labor and the work recording and accounting system is not sound, should start by rectifying the mutual aid team, improving the work recording and accounting system, and mobilizing women to participate in mutual aid labor, so as to correctly educate male and female members on equality between men and women and equal pay for equal work, and gradually implement the principle of equal pay for equal work. Some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives have a relatively sound and reasonable work recording, accounting, and distribution system, and women have participated in mutual aid labor to varying degrees, but they still retain the ideological influence of valuing men over women in scoring and calculating remuneration for women, or lowering the score, or lowering the score value, or only recording the score without accounting, or not regarding women participating in labor as members, and treating them as short-term workers. In this case, it is necessary to educate women to work hard and use their labor achievements to break the idea of ​​disregarding women, and to conduct ideological education on equality between men and women among male and female members or team members in a correct and specific way, using methods such as calculating the labor account of men and women and calculating the benefits of women's active labor for the entire cooperative and mutual aid team in production, to explain the benefits of implementing equal pay for equal work for all male and female members of the community, and strive to achieve the principle of equal pay for equal work. As for agricultural production cooperatives (including some excellent perennial mutual aid teams) that have already implemented the "piecework contract," "regional contract," or labor day system, because these systems themselves are imbued with factors of equality between men and women, it is relatively easy to implement the principle of "equal pay for equal work," but it is also necessary to reasonably stipulate production quotas or standard working points, and to constantly educate women to work hard, improve production quality, and protect their health; it is also necessary to constantly and specifically educate male and female members on equality between men and women, so that the achievements already made can be further consolidated and developed.

Third, rationally use labor and properly arrange housework and child rearing issues to increase the possibility for the vast number of women to participate in agricultural production. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams should implement the division of labor between men and women, not only to give full play to women's strengths, but also to take care of women's physical strength and housework burden. For example, some societies and teams assign light work suitable for women to women, and try to leave the village edge for women to do. In addition to mobilizing women to participate in field labor, they also advocate raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and raising livestock and poultry. At the same time, women should be educated to use the slack season and rainy days to sew clothes, make shoes, and spin, so that they can concentrate their efforts on participating in agricultural labor during the busy season and sunny days. As for cooking, feeding livestock, and raising children, these are things that must be done every day, and some things are even tighter during the busy farming season. In families with more people, it is possible to promote a rational division of labor between men, women, old and young to reduce women's housework; in families with fewer people, according to the wishes and needs of male and female peasants, relying on the strength of the masses, various collective mutual aid methods can be used to gradually solve the problem. For example, the problem of taking care of children during the busy farming season can be solved by mutual assistance between relatives and neighbors, organizing baby-holding groups, and trying to run nurseries during the busy farming season in places where conditions permit. Marriage and family disputes and maternal and infant diseases that affect women's active production should also be handled as timely as possible in combination with production. At the same time, the Marriage Law and maternal and child health should be publicized frequently to promote the realization of happy marriages and harmonious families, improve the health of mothers and children, so that male and female peasants can happily devote themselves to production.

Fourth, rural women must be educated to overcome conservative ideas and inferiority complexes, and strive to learn advanced farming methods and advanced farming techniques that can be promoted locally and that women's physical strength can handle in order to increase women's contribution to production. Most of the rational close planting, thinning, seed selection, seed soaking, cotton pruning and branching, increasing fertilizer accumulation, and pest and disease control that are currently promoted in rural areas can be done by women, and some are even more suitable for women to do. Therefore, mutual teaching and mutual learning should be advocated, and women should be educated to learn from farmers with high skills. Agricultural technology promotion stations must also pay attention to teaching women when teaching technology. Technical training classes held by the government should also select a certain number of women production activists to participate in learning in order to give full play to women's role in production.

Fifth, actively cultivate women's leadership backbone and lead most women to participate in production. Attention should be paid to protecting and helping the excellent women's backbone that has emerged, and summarizing and promoting their advanced experience; for general women cadres, they must also be patiently educated and specifically helped to gradually improve themselves. The mutual aid and cooperation training classes held in various places should also absorb a certain number of women's backbone to participate in learning. The leadership backbone of the rural women's representative conference should take leading women to participate in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement as their central task and gradually improve themselves to become the backbone in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Due to the tradition of valuing men over women for thousands of years, the growth and development of women's backbone have many difficulties, and the leadership must take extra care, patiently cultivate, and enthusiastically help. Especially when they encounter difficulties, they must be strongly supported and encouraged to overcome difficulties and continue to move forward.

In order to enable this work to move forward correctly and smoothly, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, adhere to the policy of steady progress, and correct certain tendencies of acquiescence to the status quo and rash advance in the current rural women's work. That is to say, according to the party and government's policy of leading agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation at that time and the requirements for increasing production, according to the degree of need for female labor in various places, according to women's level of awareness, labor habits, housework and child burden, etc., the needs of the entire agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation and the possible conditions for women to participate in production are appropriately combined, and on this basis, we can actively and steadily lead women of various types to participate in local mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and carry out the agricultural labor and sideline production and housework needed and that women can do at that time and place to serve the development of agricultural production. For women who are currently unwilling to participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative production, it is necessary to do patient education, help them overcome difficulties, and unite and gradually guide them to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations through women who have already been organized, and not to force orders or rush to success, nor to discriminate and attack. But on the other hand, one cannot excessively acquiesce to the small-scale peasant economy, excessively acquiesce to the backwardness of male and female peasants, and not solve the special difficulties that women can solve in participating in production at that time and place, and not boldly protect the rights of women that can be realized at that time and place, thereby relaxing or abandoning the leadership of women in participating in the production mutual aid and cooperation movement.

We firmly believe that on the basis of the increasing production enthusiasm and mutual aid and cooperation enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural women, as long as the party committees at all levels and the rural youth leagues and democratic women's federations that lead rural work can strengthen the leadership of women's work, they will be able to actively and steadily organize rural women into mutual aid and cooperative production, and unite with the broad masses of male peasants under the leadership of the working class, and strive to implement the general line, build a beautiful socialist motherland, and strive for the complete liberation of women.

    积极领导农村妇女参加农业互助合作运动
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　章蕴
    在国家过渡时期总路线总任务的照耀下，在农村中，妇女工作的中心任务，是发动和教育广大农村妇女，参加农业生产互助合作，以促进农业的合作化，逐步实现国家对农业的社会主义改造，提高农业生产力，增加农作物产量，更多地供给社会主义工业化事业所需要的粮食和原料作物；并在这个基础上提高农村妇女的社会地位，逐步实现农村妇女的彻底解放。
    农业合作化是国家对农业进行社会主义改造的必经道路，又是逐步创造农村妇女彻底解放的社会经济制度的必经道路。事实证明，农业互助合作运动的发展，为广大妇女参加农业生产开辟了广阔的道路，那里互助合作运动搞得好，那里就能发动大量妇女参加农业生产。而且互助合作组织愈是发展和逐步提高，愈有条件吸引更多的妇女参加互助劳动，如农业生产合作社就较之互助组能吸引更多的妇女参加农业生产。许多优秀的农业生产合作社为了大量增产，不同程度地采用了先进耕作法，进行精耕细作和土地加工，并发展副业为农业生产服务，因而劳动力的需要增加了，单靠男劳动力就很难及时完成增产任务，对妇女参加农业劳动的需要也就增加了。而且因为农业生产合作社有着比较合理的分配制度，就能比较合理地解决妇女劳动报酬的问题，同时在集体劳动中，由于按照分工分业的原则来使用妇女劳动力，就能够比较好地照顾妇女的特殊困难，使妇女在生产上能够发挥其特长。因而随着互助合作运动的发展，农业生产更加需用妇女参加劳动，妇女参加农业生产的可能性和积极性也日益增涨，参加农业互助合作生产的妇女也逐年增加。许多较好的农业生产合作社中，妇女的劳动日数一般都占劳动日总数的百分之二十到三十左右。正因为这样，农业生产合作社的劳动力充足了，男女农民分工合作，就有力量适时耕作，减少自然灾害，进行农业的基本建设及技术改革，促进农业增产。同时也就有力量发展与农业生产有密切关系的而且能推动农业生产发展的副业和手工业，这就提高了合作社的生产，增加了社员的收入。所以发动妇女参加互助合作生产，又是发展和巩固互助组或农业生产合作社，充分发挥其优越性的重要条件。同时，因为妇女参加集体劳动，她们的社会主义觉悟也得到提高，逐步克服了“拉后腿”、闹不团结和不积极劳动等现象。现在有很多妇女要求参加农业生产合作社，就是因为她们懂得了“合作社就是大家庭，大家庭增产，才有小家庭的富裕”，“我们只有用劲干，社会主义的幸福生活才能早到来”的道理。妇女这种对互助组、农业生产合作社和集体劳动的热爱，十分有助于国家对农业的社会主义改造。由于妇女在发展农业生产互助合作方面有了显著的作用，加之互助组贯彻实行了等价互利的原则，农业生产合作社实行了比较合理的分配制度，不少农业生产合作社和互助组不同程度地贯彻了按照男女同等工作的数量和质量，给与同等报酬的原则，因而进一步提高了妇女的经济地位，改变着旧社会歧视和虐待妇女的传统，妇女的物质和文化生活均随着改善，社会、政治地位也随着提高。
    但是从全国范围来看，由于各地农业生产互助合作运动发展得不平衡以及不少地区在农村妇女中进行的工作不够普遍深入，因而妇女参加互助合作生产的情况也极不平衡。多数妇女群众还只是在自己地里劳动或在家里劳动，参加互助组和农业生产合作社劳动的还只是少数。在互助组中，则普遍存在着“男互助、女单干”的现象。某些农村妇女中滋长着自发的资本主义思想，绝大多数妇女残存着封建的自卑观念。在许多互助组员和合作社员中，也还存在着歧视妇女的观念，不愿吸收妇女参加，或同工而不同酬，影响了妇女参加互助合作组织的积极性，也影响了互助合作组织的巩固与发展。
    为此，在今年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的时候，在全国人民集中力量为贯彻实现国家过渡时期总路线总任务而奋斗的时候，我们建议在农村中工作的各级党、政领导机关和民主妇联组织，应该认真检查农村妇女工作，总结经验教训，更积极地领导农村妇女参加农业生产互助合作运动，使农村妇女工作与农业互助合作运动相应地稳步前进。一九三○年联共（布）十六次代表大会决议，曾经责成所有党、工会、苏维埃及其他组织“加强本身的动员广大劳动妇女群众，特别是农村妇女群众来进行社会主义建设的工作”。同时指出：“把在集体农庄内的贫农、妇女、青年中的工作提到应有的高度，——这一切就成为党在农业方面顺利进行社会主义改造工作的必要前提”。列宁在谈到发动劳动者参加经济建设工作时，曾指示说：“这个由苏维埃政权所开始的工作，只有在全俄国，不是数百个妇女，而是千百万妇女参加这一工作的时候，才能够向前推进的。那个时候，我们相信，社会主义建设事业，便牢不可破了。”（苏维埃共和国女工运动的任务）对我们正在进行的农业的社会主义改造事业来说，这些指示是同样适用的。没有千百万农村妇女的积极参加，这个改造事业的完成是不可想像的。
    根据若干地区的经验，要发动妇女参加农业生产互助合作运动，在领导上必须经常地认真贯彻男女一齐发动的方针，并注意以下几个方面的问题：
    第一，结合生产，经常向妇女进行总路线的思想教育和互助合作政策教育，提高她们的社会主义觉悟，使她们热爱祖国，热爱社会主义，热爱互助组和合作社，热爱劳动，热爱公共财物，帮助她们克服自发的资本主义思想和各种具体表现；使她们懂得单干是没有出路的，长期单干下去，大多数农民就要重新陷入贫穷，广大农村妇女也就得不到自身的解放；只有实现农业合作化，逐步实现农业的社会主义改造，才能满足国家需要，保证全体农民日益富裕，保证实现农村妇女的彻底解放。为此，必须尊重妇女在社和组内的民主权利，除吸引她们参加社和组的重要会议和学习外，并可适应妇女的生活情况，召开妇女会议、家庭会议，对妇女进行更深刻的教育。
    第二，坚持实行中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中提出的“男女劳动力应该按照工作的质量和数量，实行同样的报酬”的原则，以提高妇女的生产积极性和对于合作社互助组的热爱，激发她们对于社会主义的热爱。苏联宪法第一百二十二条中把妇女有与男子平等获得工作和劳动报酬权利，作为保证实现男女平等的首要条件。斯大林同志更明确指示：“在劳动日的制度下，一切都是平等的，没有妇女和男子的区别。谁做出劳动日多，谁就多赚工资。集体农庄以实行劳动日的工作制度，解放了妇女，把她们变成能够独立的人”。因此，从生产的观点出发，或从妇女解放的观点出发，都应该贯彻执行同工同酬的原则。有些互助组，很少妇女参加互助劳动，记工算账制度也不健全，就应当从整顿互助组，健全记工算账制度，发动妇女参加互助劳动入手，来正确地向男女社员进行男女平等、同工同酬的教育，逐步贯彻执行同工同酬原则。有一些互助组、农业生产合作社，记工算账及分配制度比较健全合理，而妇女又不同程度地参加了互助劳动，但对妇女评分计酬还保留着重男轻女的思想影响，或者压低分数，或者压低分值，或者只记分不算账，或者不把参加劳动的妇女当社员看待，作为短工对待等等。对于这种情况，就要教育妇女努力劳动，以自己劳动成绩来打破轻视妇女的思想，并正确地具体地向男女社员或组员进行男女平等的思想教育，用算男女劳动账，算妇女积极劳动对于整个合作社和互助组在生产上的好处等办法，说明实行男女同工同酬，对全社男女社员的好处，努力争取实现同工同酬原则。至于已经实行“计件包干”、“分区包干”或劳动日制度的农业生产合作社（包括一部分优秀的常年互助组），由于这些制度本身贯串了男女平等的因素，比较易于贯彻“同工同酬”的原则，但是也必须合理地规定生产定额或标准工分，并经常教育妇女努力生产，提高生产质量，保护身体的健康；也必须经常地具体地向男女社员进行男女平等的教育，使已得的成绩更加巩固和发展。
    第三，合理使用劳动力，适当地安排家务及孩子的养育问题，以增加广大妇女参加农业生产的可能性。农业生产合作社和互助组应该实行男女之间的分工分业，既要发挥妇女的特长，又要照顾妇女的体力和家务负担，如有些社和组把适合妇女做的轻活分配给妇女做，尽可能留出村边近地给妇女做，以及除发动妇女参加田间劳动外，还提倡养猪积肥，饲养家畜家禽等。同时应该教育妇女利用农闲季节和下雨的日子来缝衣、做鞋、纺织，以便在农忙季节和晴天集中力量参加农业劳动。至于煮饭、喂牲口、养育孩子等，这是天天要做的，有些活在农忙时更紧。在人手较多的家庭，可以提倡男女老少之间合理分工，减轻妇女的家务劳动；在人手较少的家庭，可以根据男女农民的自愿与需要，依靠群众的力量，用多种多样的集体互助办法逐步解决。如农忙时带孩子的问题，就可以用亲邻相帮、组织抱娃娃组、及在有条件的地方试办农忙托儿所等办法来解决。对于影响妇女积极生产的婚姻、家庭纠纷与妇婴疾病等问题，也应该结合生产，尽可能及时处理。同时应该经常宣传婚姻法及妇婴卫生，以促进美满婚姻与和睦家庭的实现，增进母子健康，使男女农民都能愉快地投入生产。
    第四，必须教育农村妇女克服保守思想和自卑观念，努力学习当地可以推广的和妇女体力所能胜任的先进耕作方法和先进耕作技术，以增加妇女对生产的贡献。目前农村中推广的合理密植、间苗、选种、浸种、棉花整枝打杈、增积肥料、防治病虫害等，大部分是妇女能做的，而且有些还是更适合于妇女去作。因此就应该提倡互教互学，教育妇女向技术高的农民学习。农业技术推广站传授技术时，也必须注意传授给妇女。政府举办的技术训练班，也应选拔一定数量的妇女生产积极分子参加学习，以充分发挥妇女在生产上的作用。
    第五，积极培养妇女的领导骨干，带动大多数妇女参加生产。对于已经涌现出来的优秀的妇女骨干要注意爱护和帮助，总结和推广他们的先进经验；对于一般妇女干部，也必须耐心教育，具体帮助，使她们逐步提高。各地举办的互助合作训练班中，更应该吸收一定数量的妇女骨干参加学习。乡村妇女代表会议的领导骨干，应把领导妇女参加农业互助合作运动作为自己的中心任务，逐步提高自己成为互助合作组织中的骨干分子。由于几千年重男轻女的传统，妇女骨干的成长和发展是有很多困难的，领导上必须加意爱护，耐心培养，热情帮助。特别在她们遇到困难时，要大力支持，鼓舞她们克服困难，继续前进。
    为使这一工作能够正确地顺利地前进，必须加强党的领导，坚持稳步前进的方针，纠正目前农村妇女工作中的某些迁就现状和急躁冒进的偏向。这就是要根据当时当地党、政领导农业生产互助合作的方针与增产的要求，根据各地对女劳动力的需要程度，根据妇女的觉悟程度、劳动习惯、家务和孩子的负担等，把整个农业生产互助合作的需要与妇女参加生产的可能条件适当结合，在这基础上才能积极而又稳步地领导各种不同类型的妇女参加当地互助合作组织，进行当时当地所需要的又是妇女可能办到的农业劳动和为发展农业生产服务的副业生产与家务劳动。对于目前还不愿意参加农业互助合作生产的妇女，要作耐心的教育，帮助她们克服困难，并通过已经组织起来的妇女来团结和逐步引导她们参加互助合作组织，而不能强迫命令，急于求成，也不能歧视和打击。但是另一方面，也不能过分地迁就小农经济，过分地迁就男女农民的落后性，而不去解决当时当地可能解决的妇女参加生产中的特殊困难，不去大胆地保护当时当地可能实现的妇女权利，因而放松或放弃对于妇女参加生产互助合作运动的领导。
    我们深信：在广大农村妇女日益高涨的生产积极性和互助合作积极性的基础上，只要领导农村工作的各级党委和农村的青年团和民主妇联能够加强对于妇女工作的领导，就一定能够积极而又稳妥地把农村妇女组织到互助合作生产中来，和广大的男农民一起，团结在工人阶级领导之下，为着贯彻实现总路线，为着建设美好的社会主义祖国和为着妇女的彻底解放事业而努力奋斗。
