Meteorology is a science that studies the various physical phenomena and processes that occur in the atmosphere. It is closely related to all sectors of the national economy.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China's meteorological undertaking was basically controlled by imperialism and served the merchant ships and civil aviation of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism.

After liberation, China's meteorological undertaking entered a new stage. It has become a people's meteorological undertaking serving national construction. Over the past four years, under the leadership of Party, government, and military organizations at all levels, and with the active efforts of meteorological workers, China's meteorological work has played a certain role in national economic construction and in safeguarding the safety of people's lives and property. For example, in 1952, the typhoon broadcasts jointly organized by the East China People's Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory enabled the people of East China to calmly prepare for defense before typhoon attacks, greatly reducing the disaster and avoiding or reducing the loss of state property and people's lives and property. In 1952, the most severely affected areas of Ningbo and Taizhou in Zhejiang Province, which were hit by the third typhoon, received news of the typhoon from the radio in advance, and immediately mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to lead disaster prevention, which finally prevented serious damage to farmland and water conservancy. Among them, the Ningbo area mobilized 200,000 people to repair and guard the coastal seawalls and river embankments day and night, ensuring the safety of 300 kilometers of seawalls and preventing large areas of farmland from being flooded. Wenling and Huangyan counties in the Taizhou area harvested 70% of the early rice before the typhoon arrived. Many coastal counties also carried out prevention in time because they had heard typhoon forecasts from the radio station in advance, thus avoiding disasters. In terms of fisheries, the East China Aquatic Products Administration immediately informed fishermen after receiving typhoon warnings at the heavy rain warning stations set up in the main fish-producing areas of East China, so that fishermen could promptly sail their fishing boats to safe areas to take shelter from the wind, and tried to notify fishermen who had gone out to sea to quickly return to safe areas. Therefore, East China fishermen rarely had accidents during the typhoons in 1952. The coastal salt fields in East China also listened to typhoon warning broadcasts and were not damaged in the typhoons of 1952, safely passing the typhoon season. In addition, the telecommunications, power, insurance, shipping and other enterprises in Shanghai also avoided or reduced losses by carrying out defense and rescue after listening to the typhoon warning broadcasts. Of course, these are only some examples. Now, cold wave and typhoon warnings have become one of the regular tasks of the central and local meteorological observatories, and the various production and construction departments have also established close contact with the central and local meteorological observatories to obtain the necessary meteorological information, forecasts and recorded data, which undoubtedly plays a certain guaranteeing role for economic construction and production.

However, because meteorology is a young science in our country with a very weak foundation, the technical level of the staff is not high enough, and the equipment is not complete, weather forecasts are sometimes not accurate enough. Therefore, improving the work quality of stations; improving the accuracy of data and forecasts; doing a good job in forecasting and warning dangerous weather; and gradually building stations urgently needed by various economic construction departments are the main tasks of the meteorological department at present. Especially in the future, when the country carries out large-scale economic construction and develops agricultural production and other undertakings, doing a good job in meteorological work will be of greater significance. For example, in 1954 and in the next few years, more and more major projects will begin construction or continue construction in various parts of our country. These projects require the meteorological department to provide accurate meteorological information and meteorological record data in terms of construction planning and construction management. Therefore, improving the accuracy of meteorological information and forecasts, and accumulating, recording, and statistically analyzing data more accurately is a regular and important task of the meteorological department.

In 1954 and in the next few years, the electric power industry, which serves as the power source for various industrial raw materials, will undergo great development. In the first five-year plan, we will build thermal power generation areas. In addition to the need for power plants to observe wind direction, wind speed, and maximum and minimum temperatures, especially when designing high-voltage lines outside the plant, we also need records of wind direction, wind speed, snow accumulation, and wire icing in various areas to calculate the bearing capacity that each section of the line should have.

In 1954 and in the next few years, we will start to build hydropower stations on several major rivers across the country. In addition to the Yongding River Reservoir that has already been built and the Hun River Reservoir that is under construction, which continue to need monthly rainfall data and maximum rainfall intensity data over the years, the Yellow River, Han River, and Xin'an River are also being explored and need hydrological, geological, and meteorological data. Reservoir projects not only need data such as annual rainfall and evaporation in the relevant basin as the basis for designing the size and quality of the project, but also hope that the meteorological department can make a complete study of the causes, types, range of rainfall centers, movement, and continuity of heavy rains in various regions of the country, so as to accurately calculate the capacity or discharge of each reservoir, and design the most economical and practical project. Even during the project, the meteorological department's continuous supply of rainfall forecasts is closely related to the arrangement of project progress and the formulation of specific construction plans.

In addition, the meteorological department also bears a very important responsibility in the annual flood prevention work. In spring, the meteorological department needs to pay attention to the weather upstream being warm and downstream being cold, and do a good job in forecasting ice jams. In summer, it is necessary to pay attention to heavy rains, report the range, movement, and maximum rainfall of heavy rain areas, and make heavy rain forecasts within three days as much as possible, so that the water conservancy department can make timely preparations for flood prevention to protect the safety of people's lives and property along the rivers.

To fundamentally control river disasters, it is necessary to plant trees, but afforestation must be based on meteorological data to determine the planting area, tree species, and afforestation methods; it is necessary to rely on weather forecasts to defend against special weather such as heavy rain, cold waves, and dry winds that may harm seedlings. As for patrolling forest areas to prevent fires, this requires local meteorological data and flight weather forecasts for patrol areas during the flight.

In 1954 and in the next few years, the main task in agriculture is to develop and increase the yield of major crops such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, and other industrial crops, and to develop animal husbandry. However, increasing the yield of crops also requires the close cooperation of meteorological work. Accurate and timely weather information and large-scale disastrous weather warnings can not only enable rural workers to arrange drought prevention, flood prevention, wind prevention, and frost prevention work in time to avoid or reduce these natural disasters, but also enable them to guide farmers to sow in time, cultivate in time, and harvest in time based on meteorological information. It can also predict the birth and growth of diseases and insect pests based on weather changes and exterminate them in a timely manner. In the future, after developing microclimate research, we will further grasp the relationship between meteorological elements such as near-surface temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and the growth of crops in various periods, which will enable us to further improve yields by controlling various meteorological elements during the crop growth period.

The increase in agricultural production is inseparable from the development of irrigation, and the plans for irrigation canals and reservoirs must be designed based on the average figures of local annual temperature, rainfall, evaporation, etc. In order to grasp the rational distribution and use of irrigation water in a timely manner, the meteorological department needs to make the time and location of forecasts as specific as possible, while providing reference materials on meteorological conditions over a longer period.

The salt industry also needs the close cooperation of meteorological work. Coastal salt fields must formulate annual production plans based on the local monthly rainy days, solar radiation, temperature, humidity, wind direction, and wind speed over the years. Salt fields generally welcome continuous sunny days, strong solar radiation, high temperatures, low humidity, and dry winds from the land with higher wind speeds, because this allows salt to be produced quickly. Salt fields fear heavy rain when harvesting, which would cause all products to be lost. If there is a weather forecast, it can be prevented in advance.

In 1954 and in the following years, the transportation industry will also develop accordingly. The relationship between meteorology and the transportation industry is also very close. Highways and railways need data such as rainfall and temperature on the route during design, and the scouring force of rainwater must be fully estimated. A large amount of land transportation often requires the cooperation of meteorological forecasting work, and other modes of transportation such as sea, river, and lake transportation also often require weather forecasts. Civil aviation flights not only need the meteorological department to provide accurate meteorological information, but also need to know the wind direction and wind speed at various altitudes in order to find the largest tailwind and the smallest headwind layer, so that they can ensure safety and save gasoline during flight. Transportation is an important condition for consolidating national defense and promoting political and cultural development, and it is also an important link in developing the national economy. We must guarantee their smooth operation and prevent accidents from a meteorological perspective.

As mentioned above, meteorological work is a very important undertaking in the entire national construction work. If done well, it can ensure the smooth progress of construction work, save a large amount of state funds, and protect the safety of people's lives; if done poorly, it will also cause certain losses to state and people's property. Therefore, meteorological workers all over the country must further strengthen their sense of responsibility, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and continuously improve their technical level and the accuracy of meteorological record data and forecasts. Economic construction departments at all levels also need to take the initiative to frequently put forward opinions and requirements to relevant meteorological institutions or meteorological observatories and stations to promote their work. Only in this way can the meteorological undertaking catch up with the large-scale economic construction of the country.

    气象工作在国家建设时期中的作用桂搏秋
    气象学是一门研究大气中所发生的各种物理现象和过程的科学。它对国民经济的各个部门都有着极为密切的关系。
    在国民党反动统治时期，我国的气象事业基本上控制在帝国主义手中，而且是为帝国主义和官僚资本主义的商船、民航服务的。
    解放以后，我国的气象事业踏上了一个新的阶段。它已经成为为国家建设服务的人民的气象事业。四年来，在各级党、政、军的领导下和气象工作者的积极努力下，我国的气象工作在国家经济建设和保障人民生命财产安全方面，都起了一定的作用。例如一九五二年华东人民广播电台和上海气象台联合举办的台风广播，就曾使华东地区人民能够在台风袭击之前，从容地作好防御工作，大大减轻了灾情，避免或减少了国家资财和人民生命财产的损失。一九五二年遭受第三次台风袭击最厉害的浙江省宁波、台州等专区，由于事前从广播里得到台风的消息，立即动员了大批干部下乡领导防灾，终于使农田水利未受严重灾害；其中宁波专区发动了二十万群众日夜抢修和轮流守护沿海海塘和江堤，保证了三百公里海塘的安全，大批农田得以免遭水灾；台州专区温岭、黄岩两县在台风未到之前抢割了百分之七十的早稻；沿海很多县份也都因为事先收听到广播电台的台风预报，及时进行了预防而免遭灾害。在渔业方面，华东水产管理局在华东主要产鱼区设立的暴雨警报站在收听到台风警报以后，立刻告诉渔民，使渔民能够及时将渔船驶到安全地带避风，并设法通知已出海捕鱼的渔民迅速驶回安全地区，因此，在一九五二年各次台风中华东渔民都很少发生事故。华东沿海各盐场也因收听台风警报广播，在
  一九五二年各次台风中没有受到损失，安全渡过了台风季节。另外如上海的电信、电业机关、保险航运等企业，也都因为收听台风警报广播后进行防御、抢救，避免了或减少了损失。当然，这只是一部分的事例而已。现在寒潮和台风警报已经成为中央和各地气象台的经常工作之一，而各生产建设部门也和中央与各地气象台取得了密切的联系，获得必要的气象情报、预报和记录资料，这些，无疑地对于经济建设和生产是起了一定的保证作用的。
    但是，因为气象科学在我国乃是一门年青的科学，基础非常薄弱，工作人员的技术水平还不太高，器材也不完备，因而天气预测有时还不够准确；所以，在现有的基础上提高台、站的工作质量；提高资料和预报的准确率；作好危险天气预报、警报工作；逐步建设为各经济建设部门迫切需要的台、站，乃是当前气象部门的主要任务。尤其是在今后国家进行大规模经济建设，发展农业生产等事业中，作好气象工作更具有重大的意义。比如：在一九五四年和今后几年中，我国各地将有更多、更重大的工程要开始施工或继续施工，这些工程，在建设计划上，在施工管理上，就需要气象部门提供准确的气象情报和气象记录资料，因此，提高气象情报和预报的准确率，更准确地累积记录和统计资料，乃是气象部门的一项经常而重要的工作。
    在一九五四年和今后几年中，作为各种工业原料动力的电力工业将有很大的发展。在第一个五年计划中，我们要建设火力发电区。建设火力发电区，除了电力厂需要观测风向、风速、最高最低温度以外，特别在设计厂外高压线路的时候，还需要各该地区的风向、风速、积雪和电线结冰等记录，用来计算各区各段线路应有的承担力。
    在一九五四年和今后几年中，我们要在全国若干大河流着手兴建水电站，除已建筑的永定河水库和正在动工中的浑河水库，继续需要供给历年逐月的雨量、最大降水强度等雨量资料外，黄河、汉水、新安江等河流也正在勘察，也需要水文、地质、气象等资料。水库工程不但需要有关流域的历年雨量、蒸发量等资料作为设计工程大小和工程质量的依据，而且还希望气象部门能将国内各地区暴雨的成因、类型、降雨中心区的范围、移动及其连续性等作出完整的研究，以便准确计算各水库的应有容量或宣泄量，设计出最为经济而又实用的工程。就是在工程进行中，气象部门不断地供给降雨预报，对布置工程进度和拟定具体施工计划等，也是有着极为密切的关系的。
    此外，每年在防汛工作上，气象部门所负的责任也是非常重大的。气象部门在春季需要注意上流和暖、下流寒冷的天气，作好凌汛的预报。在夏季又要注意暴雨，报告出暴雨区的范围、移动和一次最大暴雨量，并尽可能作出三天以内的暴雨预报，这样，水利部门才能及时作好防汛的准备工作，以保障沿河沿江人民生命财产的安全。
    根治河患必须造林，但造林必须根据气象资料来决定种植的地区、树种以及育林的方法；需要根据天气预报来防御特殊天气——暴雨、寒潮、旱风等对树苗的侵袭。至于巡视林区以防火灾，这就需要当地的气象资料和航程中巡区的飞行天气预报。
    在一九五四年和今后几年中，农业方面的主要任务是发展和提高粮食、棉花、油料及其它工业作物等主要农作物的产量并发展畜牧事业，但提高农作物的产量也需要得到气象工作的密切配合。准确而及时的天气情报和大范围灾害性的天气警报，不但可以使农村工作者能够及时布置防旱、防涝、防风以及防霜冻等工作，以避免或减轻这些自然灾害，同时可以使他们能够根据气象情报指导农民及时播种，及时耕耘，及时收割。并且还能够根据天气变化预知病虫的出生和生长，适时地予以扑灭。将来发展小气候研究后，还要进一步掌握近地面的温度、湿度、日射等气象要素和农作物各期成长的关系，这就能够进一步由控制农作物成长时期的各项气象要素来提高产量。
    农业的增产离不开灌溉事业的发展，而灌溉渠、蓄水塘的计划，必须根据当地历年的气温、雨量、蒸发量等平均数字才能设计，为了适时地掌握灌溉水量的合理支配和使用，还需要气象部门把预报的时间和地点尽可能地作得具体，同时提供较长时间内气象情况的参考资料。
    盐业也需要气象工作的密切配合。沿海盐场须根据当地历年各月的雨日、日射、气温、湿度、风向、风速来拟订全年生产计划。盐场一般欢迎的是连续的晴天，较强的日射，较高的气温，较低的湿度，以及陆上来的较高风速的旱风，因为这样出盐迅速。盐场怕的是临收获时遇有暴雨，使产品全部流失，如果有了天气预报，就可以事先加以预防。
    在一九五四年和以后的几年中，交通运输业也将相应地发展。气象事业和交通运输事业的关系也非常密切。公路和铁路从设计时就需要路线上的雨量和温度等资料，特别对雨水的冲刷力要作充分的估计。陆路上的大量运输经常需要气象预报工作的配合，其他如海运、河运、湖运也经常需要天气预报。至于民航飞行不但需要气象部门供给准确的气象情报，而且需要知道各高度的风向、风速以便找到最大的顺风、最小的逆风层，在飞行时就可以保证安全并节省汽油。交通运输是巩固国防和促进政治、文化发展的重要条件，又是发展国民经济的重要环节，我们要从气象上来保证它们顺利工作，防止事故的发生。
    如上所述，气象工作在整个国家建设工作中是一种十分重要的事业。作得好，可以保证建设工作的顺利进行，并为国家节省大笔资财，保障人民生命的安全；做得不好，也会造成国家人民财产的某些损失。因此，全国各地的气象工作者须进一步加强工作责任心，认真学习苏联先进经验，不断提高自己的技术水平，提高气象纪录资料和预报的准确率。各级经济建设部门也需要主动地向有关气象机构或气象台、站经常提出意见和要求，以推进其工作。这样，才能使气象事业迎头赶上国家大规模经济建设。
