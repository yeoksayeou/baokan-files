The Berlin Conference agreement on convening the Geneva Conference to seek the restoration of peace in Indochina has been widely welcomed by the French working people and people from all walks of life. A powerful movement to end the colonial war against the people of Indochina, which has lasted for seven or eight years and caused great disaster to France, has unfolded throughout France.

This powerful movement of the French people has created enormous pressure on the ruling groups in the French government and has inevitably been reflected in the French Parliament first and foremost. The debates on the Indochina issue held in the French National Assembly on March 5th and 9th were promoted by this important development in the French political situation.

In the debate, deputies from all parties unanimously agreed to end the Indochina War through negotiations. Many deputies vehemently criticized the French government's policy in Indochina. Right-wing party deputies who had previously supported the government's policy no longer placed their hopes on a hopeless "military victory" and adopted a more realistic attitude.

French Prime Minister Laniel admitted that this unanimous attitude in the parliamentary debate on the Indochina issue was unprecedented.

It is remembered that the French Communist Party and its parliamentary group have consistently and resolutely advocated ending this dirty colonial war. Due to the growing pressure from the people's demand to end the war, as embodied by the French Communist Party, and due to the growing heroic struggle of the Indochinese people to defend peace and national independence, the French Parliament's attitude toward the Indochina issue has changed greatly in recent years. During the parliamentary debate in 1948, only five votes, in addition to those cast by the French Communist deputies, were cast against the war in Indochina. However, by the time of the parliamentary debate in October 1953, the proposal supporting the government's current policy on the Indochina issue barely passed by a vote of 315 to 251 (including the votes of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Republican Progressive Union, and part of the Radical Socialist Party). Nevertheless, the proposal that was passed at that time also stated that it would "make every effort to seek comprehensive peace in Asia through negotiations."

Now, the situation of the French Parliament's debate shows that it has become increasingly difficult for the ruling groups in the French government and the right-wing party deputies who support it to refuse to fulfill their promise to the people to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue and to continue the colonial war that is mired in difficulties.

In this debate, many deputies demanded that steps be taken to end the war before the Geneva Conference. They believed that this would not conflict with the Geneva Conference and would be conducive to reaching an agreement at the Geneva Conference. As a result of the debate, the Deshayes Maison proposal was passed by a vote of 349 to 263, refusing to seek a ceasefire in Indochina before the Geneva Conference, but expressing welcome to the Geneva Conference, believing that "the purpose of this conference is to determine appropriate ways to end the painful Indochina War."

This resolution was regarded as "the Laniel government has obtained the National Assembly's support for its Indochina policy" (AFP dispatch). The joint forces of the right-wing parties, which have consistently supported the government's policies and enabled this resolution to be passed, are now working with the government to ensure that it does not "weaken the government's bargaining power at the Geneva Conference."

It is worth noting the attitude expressed by French Prime Minister Laniel in the parliamentary debate. He reiterated that "France will welcome a diplomatic solution to the Indochina War," but put forward "military conditions for achieving a ceasefire," demanding that the Lao and Cambodian people's armed forces must "withdraw"; at the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army must "withdraw" or "disarm" from the Red River Delta and South Vietnam, and the Vietnamese People's Army in central and northern Vietnam must also be "concentrated" in "strictly defined areas." These absurd so-called "conditions" were immediately criticized by the parliament and public opinion. French socialists believed that these were not ceasefire proposals but rather conditions for the Indochinese people to "surrender."

Despite Laniel's efforts to defend the contradiction between the promise he had long ago made to the people to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue and the actual actions of the French government in continuing the Indochina War, he is now, while reiterating past promises, actually calling for a continuation of the war, repeatedly saying that "our military efforts will not be relaxed," and still emphasizing his "policy of force," which has long been proven to be hopeless. He openly declared: "As long as we cannot defeat the strength of our enemies, we will continue to implement the policy of defeating this strength."

Laniel openly stated that the "ceasefire conditions" he proposed were "formulated based on the results of the recent on-the-spot investigation of the battlefield by Minister of Defense Pleven." The purpose of Pleven's trip to the Indochina war zone this time, and why Chief of General Staff Eli, who went there with him, is going to Washington, cannot of course be any secret.

It has been noted that some French ministers are preparing to play a trick on the Geneva Conference, which is to drag it out indefinitely, even if they do not sabotage the negotiations on the Indochina issue, so that no agreement can be reached on substantive issues.

One of the tasks of the Geneva Conference is to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina. This requires guaranteeing the rights of the Indochinese people to peace and independence. However, some groups in France are afraid of solving the problem based on the principles of freedom and national independence for all nations. The French government is rushing to hold so-called "independence" negotiations with the Bao Dai puppet in Paris, attempting to grant this infamous puppet group, despised by the Vietnamese people, "complete independence" "within the French Federation" in order to "greatly strengthen the position of France and the free world at the Geneva Conference." French Foreign Minister Bidault openly stated at the French Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on March 3rd: "There is no need to invite representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government to the conference." At the same time, precisely because the French government is determined to maintain its colonial rule in Indochina, some French ministers have not relaxed their struggle to collude with American interventionists to expand the Indochina War. The "New York Times" revealed that the French command had drafted a military plan to continue the war until the end of this year.

Any diplomatic and military plans made by the French government groups that would create difficulties for the Geneva Conference can only facilitate the groups across the ocean in the United States that are pursuing a "policy of strength" to realize their sinister purpose of eagerly harming French interests and sabotaging the Geneva Conference.

The American ruling group is strengthening its pressure on France, forcing France not to take any steps to end the war, but to continue the war, and to get chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. "Wall Street Journal" diplomatic reporter Cromley revealed, obviously not without basis, that the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon are currently drafting new plans to intensify and expand intervention in the Indochina War. He wrote that American decision-makers "definitely believe that the Geneva Conference will definitely fail and the Indochina War will definitely continue." Therefore, they want to further "think of ways to turn the Indochina War into a United Nations war like the Korean War," with the United States as the supreme commander in the Indochina War, preventing the withdrawal of French troops, training and expanding the Indochinese puppet army, and forcing "Asian member states" of the United Nations to provide cannon fodder.

Such conspiracies, of course, cannot block the eyes of sober-minded people in the French Parliament, preventing them from paying attention to any connection between the policies adopted by the French government groups and the American intervention plan.

Many deputies made their own analyses of the current situation in the debate and raised penetrating questions.

French Communist Deputy Ciovanni emphasized that France's colonial war in Indochina violates French interests, damages French credibility, destroys France, and makes it completely dependent on the United States.

Radical Socialist Deputy Mendes-France criticized from a different perspective: "Some French ministers secretly want to incite American military intervention in Indochina, while also attempting to create the belief that they hope to end this war with clever diplomatic maneuvers."

Therefore, such questions are inevitably raised. For example, Meyer, the Socialist leader who requested this debate and the chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, asked in his speech: What position will France take at the Geneva Conference? Will it adopt an independent policy that is not dependent on the United States?

It can be seen that Prime Minister Laniel and his ministers did not express a clear attitude on these issues, but only vaguely denied that the government had lost its freedom of action in future negotiations, and denied that France had made any obligations to the United States government regarding France's position on the Indochina issue when it begged for aid from the United States. However, such denials have no persuasiveness in the face of past and present facts. The official communiqué issued by Paris and Washington in September 1953 clearly stated that the United States would provide France with an additional $385 million in "aid" as "an appropriation for the plan to fight in Vietnam," and that France was obligated to increase its expeditionary forces in Indochina and implement the "Navarre Plan." Since then, the French government has not taken peaceful steps, but has continued the war, and the United States has gradually increased its involvement in the Indochina War.

The increasingly high tide of the French people's struggle to defend the country's peace, security, and independent rights has made the French ruling groups very afraid that their policy of linking their fate with the United States will be completely exposed, so they are trying to cover it up. The American propaganda machine is especially trying to cover up the fact that the United States is using the temptation of more dollars to force France to both ratify the "European Army" treaty and fight for the United States in Indochina, a self-serving and hegemonic act that harms others and benefits oneself. For this unspeakable purpose, influential figures and reactionary newspapers in the United States have tried their best to distort the facts and reverse black and white, attempting to push the responsibility for the war onto the Indochinese people and slander the peaceful diplomatic policy of the People's Republic of China.

However, this debate in the French National Assembly did not achieve any effect with this trickery; on the contrary, the speeches of many deputies reflected the widespread urgent demands of people from all walks of life in France to get rid of the United States, adopt an independent policy, and adopt a policy of peacefully resolving the Indochina issue. They recognize that the only and possible way to solve the problem of restoring peace in Indochina is to reach agreements that conform to the principles of freedom and national independence of all nations, rather than to continue that hopeless war.

    法国议会的辩论说明了什么胡今
    柏林会议关于召开日内瓦会议谋求恢复印度支那和平的协议，获得了法国劳动人民和其他各阶层人士的普遍欢迎。争取结束继续了七八年的反对印度支那人民及造成法国极大灾难的殖民战争的强大运动，已在全法国展开。
    法国人民的这种强大运动，形成了对法国政府集团现行政策的巨大压力，并首先不能不反映到法国议会上来。法国国民议会在三月五日和九日就印度支那问题进行的辩论，就是法国政治形势的这一重要发展所促成的。
    在辩论中发言的各党派议员一致赞成用谈判来结束印度支那战争。许多议员激烈抨击法国政府在印度支那的政策。过去支持政府政策的右翼党派议员，也不再寄托于毫无希望的“军事胜利”，而采取了比较现实的态度。
    法国总理拉尼埃承认：议会辩论印度支那问题时的这种一致的态度，是前所未见的。
    人们记得，法国共产党及其在议会中的党团，一贯坚决主张结束这场肮脏的殖民战争。由于法国共产党所体现的人民要求结束战争的压力日益巨大，由于印度支那人民为保卫和平与民族独立而进行的英勇斗争日益壮大，使得法国议会对印度支那问题的态度这几年来发生了很大的变化。在一九四八年议会辩论时，除法共议员投的票以外，仅有五票反对在印度支那的战争。但到了一九五三年十月议会辩论时，支持政府现行对印度支那问题的政策的提案仅以三百一十五票对二百五十一票（包括共产党、社会党、进步共和联盟和部分激进社会党的票）勉强获得通过。虽然如此，那时被通过的提案，也表示要“尽一切力量通过谈判谋取亚洲全面和平。”
    现在，法国议会辩论的情况，说明了法国政府集团和支持它的右翼党派议员们，企图不执行其对国民所许下的和平解决印度支那问题的诺言，继续进行陷于困境的殖民战争，已越来越感到困难了。
    在这次辩论中许多议员要求在日内瓦会议以前就采取步骤来结束战争。他们认为这样并不和日内瓦会议抵触，而且有利于日内瓦会议达成协议。辩论结果以三百四十九票对二百六十三票通过了德塞麦松的提案，拒绝在日内瓦会议以前谋求印度支那停火，但对日内瓦会议表示欢迎，认为“这个会议的目的是要确定能结束痛苦的印度支那战争的适当办法”。
    这个决议被视为“拉尼埃政府获得了国民议会对它的印度支那政策的支持”（法新社电）。使这个决议获得通过的、过去一直支持政府政策的右翼党派联合势力，现在和政府一起力求保证不致“削弱政府在日内瓦会议上讨价还价的力量”。
    值得注意的是，法国总理拉尼埃在议会辩论中所表示的态度。他重申“法国将欢迎通过外交方式来解决印度支那战争”，但提出了“实现停火的军事条件”，竟要求寮国和高棉的人民武装必须“撤退”；同时，越南人民军必须从红河三角洲和南越“撤退”或“解除武装”，在中越的越南人民军也必须“集中”在“严格划定的地区”。这些荒谬绝伦的所谓“条件”，立即遭到了议会和舆论的纷纷指责。法国社会党人认为这与其说是停战建议，不如说是命令印度支那人民“投降”的条件。
    拉尼埃尽管竭力替自己过去早就对国民许下的和平解决印度支那问题的诺言和法国政府继续进行印度支那战争的实际行动之间的矛盾进行辩护，但是，现在，当他重申过去的诺言时，实际上是在呼吁继续进行战争，口口声声说“我们的军事努力将不会放松”，依然强调他的早已证明为毫无希望的“武力政策”。他公然宣布说：“只要我们一天不能打垮我们敌人的力量，我们就一天要实行打垮这种力量的政策。”
    拉尼埃公开说，他提出的“停火条件”，是“根据国防部长普利文最近在战场上实地调查的结果而拟定的”。而普利文这次到印度支那战区为了什么目的，和他一起到那里去的总参谋长埃利将到华盛顿去又是为了什么，这当然不可能是什么秘密。
    人们已经注意到，法国的某些部长正在准备对日内瓦会议玩弄一种阴谋，这就是即使不破坏关于印度支那问题的谈判，也要把它无限期地拖下去，使在实质的问题上不能达成协议。
    日内瓦会议的一个任务是讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。这就必须保证印度支那人民的和平与独立权利。但是，法国的某些集团却害怕根据各民族的自由与民族独立的原则来解决问题。法国政府正在赶忙与保大傀儡在巴黎举行所谓“独立”谈判，企图给予这个为越南人民所唾弃的声名狼藉的傀儡集团以“在法兰西联邦之内”的“完全独立”，来“大大加强法国和自由世界在日内瓦会议上的地位”。法国外长皮杜尔三月三日在法国参议院外交委员会上发言时，更公然说：“没有必要请胡志明政府的代表参加会议”。同时，正是由于法国政府一心要保持它在印度支那的殖民地统治，法国的某些部长并没有放松他们勾结美国干涉者扩大印度支那战争的挣扎活动。“纽约时报”就透露法国司令部已拟出了把战争进行到今年年底的军事计划。
    法国政府集团所作的任何会使日内瓦会议产生困难的外交上和军事上的打算，都只能便利大洋彼岸的美国推行“实力政策”的集团，来实现其急于要损害法国利益，破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋目的。
    美国统治集团正在加强对法国施行压力，迫使法国不是采取任何步骤来结束战争，而是把战争继续下去，为美国火中取栗。“华尔街日报”外交记者克罗姆莱就显然不是没有根据地透露说：美国国务院和五角大楼目前正在拟订加紧扩大干涉印度支那战争的新计划。他写道，美国的决策者“肯定地认为日内瓦会议一定失败，而印度支那战争一定打下去”。因此，他们要进一步“想法把印度支那战争变为像朝鲜战争一样的联合国战争”，由美国作为印度支那战争中的最高指挥者，防止法军撤退，训练和扩大印度支那傀儡军队，并强迫联合国中的“亚洲成员国”提供炮灰。
    这种阴谋勾当，当然无法遮住法国议会中头脑清醒的人们的目光，使他们不去注视法国政府集团所采取的政策和美国的干涉计划的任何关联。
    许多议员都在辩论中对当前的局势作了自己的分析，并提出了一针见血的问题。
    法共议员希奥沃尼强调指出：法国在印度支那的殖民战争违反法国的利益，败坏法国的信誉，毁灭着法国并使它完全依赖于美国。
    激进社会党议员孟戴斯—弗朗斯从不同的角度指责说：“某些法国部长内心里想激起美国对印度支那的军事干涉，同时又企图以巧妙的外交手腕来创造出他们希望结束这个战争的信念”。
    因此，像这样的问题也就不可避免地会提了出来，譬如，要求举行这次辩论的社会党领袖、国民议会外交委员会主席麦耶，在发言中质问道：在日内瓦会议上，法国将采取什么立场？是不是采取不依附美国的独立政策？
    人们看到，拉尼埃总理和他的部长们都没有就这些问题表示明确的态度，而只是含糊地否认政府已失去了在将来谈判中的行动自由，并否认法国向美国乞援时曾就法国在印度支那问题上的立场向美国政府承担了任何义务。但是，这样的否认，在过去和当前的事实面前都没有任何说服力。一九五三年九月巴黎和华盛顿发表的官方公报，就明明白白地说：美国给予法国三亿八千五百万美元的额外“援助”，是“作为对越南作战的计划的拨款”，而法国有义务在印度支那增加远征军和实现“纳瓦尔计划”。自那时以来，法国政府并没有采取和平的步骤，而是使战争继续进行，美国从而一步紧一步地参与印度支那战争。
    法国人民为保卫国家的和平安全与独立权利的日益高涨的斗争，使得法国统治集团十分害怕它们把自己的命运和美国连在一起的政策彻底暴露，因而它们力图加以掩饰。美国的宣传机器尤其竭力想掩盖美国正在利用更多的美元的诱惑，来强迫法国既要批准“欧洲军”条约又要在印度支那为美国作战的损人利己的霸道行为。为了这个不可告人的目的，美国的有势力人物和反动报刊就极尽歪曲事实颠倒黑白之能事，企图把战争的责任推到印度支那人民的身上，并毁谤中华人民共和国的和平外交政策。
    但是，法国国民议会的这次辩论，并没有使这种遮眼法收到什么效果；相反地，许多议员的发言反映出法国各社会阶层的广泛人士迫切要求摆脱美国，采取独立的政策，采取和平解决印度支那问题的政策。他们认识到：只有靠达成符合于各国人民自由和民族独立原则的协议的办法，而不是靠继续进行那毫无希望的战争的办法，才是解决恢复印度支那和平问题的唯一的而且可能的途径。
