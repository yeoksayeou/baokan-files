Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 12th. The Vietnam Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" published an article commenting on the negotiations held in Paris by the French colonialists and their running dogs since March 8th.

The newspaper wrote: In order to carry out the orders of the French and American imperialists, the puppet Prime Minister Bao Loc has gone to France to conduct so-called negotiations with the French colonialists. Before leaving Vietnam, Bao Loc shamelessly claimed that he would achieve complete independence for Vietnam within two weeks.

The newspaper said: People still remember that the puppets Bao Dai and Nguyen Van Tam signed an agreement on March 8, 1949, which recognized the rule of the French colonialists in Vietnam and promised to supply them with manpower and material resources in order to prolong this dirty war, but they called this independence. On July 3, 1953, the French colonialists staged another comedy of revising the terms of this agreement, promising independence to the member states of the Federation. On the other hand, they arranged negotiations and boasted with absurd words that complete independence had been granted to their puppets.

The newspaper continued: Now in Paris, the French colonialists and their running dogs are staging the same comedy again. The French reactionaries and the puppet newspapers and news agencies are now vigorously promoting the so-called negotiations in Paris. However, this farce cannot deceive the public. The Vietnamese people, especially the residents who have lived under the brutal exploitation and oppression of the imperialists in the French-occupied areas in the past few years, have seen through the enemy's tricks. The people behind enemy lines, thanks to their firm belief in President Ho Chi Minh and the resistance government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, are waging a resolute struggle against the imperialists and their running dogs every day.

Even the French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" admitted on February 10 that, in fact, the cloak of "independence" prepared by the French colonialists for the Bao Dai regime was only mentioned in Bao Loc's speech, and Bao Loc was despised by every honest Vietnamese citizen. André Piettre, a member of the French Socialist Party, recently published an article in the French "People's Daily" after returning from investigating the opinions of the Vietnamese people in the enemy-occupied areas, saying: The Bao Dai-Bao Loc group does not receive any support from the people, while President Ho Chi Minh is a person who is greatly respected and loved by the people, and he symbolizes the sincere hope of the Vietnamese people. These facts prove that even in the French bourgeois group, there are many people who doubt the ability of the puppets Bao Dai and Bao Loc.

On the other hand, the prestige of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by President Ho Chi Minh is increasing day by day. The victories won by the Vietnam People's Army, especially the recent victories, as well as the achievements made by the Lao and Cambodian People's Liberation Army, have caused great panic among the French and American imperialists. In this situation, many figures in the French government have expressed their willingness to resolve the Indochina issue peacefully.

However, the warmongers in the French government and the American imperialists, in order to prolong the Indochina war, are still trying to actively implement their conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" and "using war to support war." This explains why they must stage this old-fashioned farce, dressing up these puppets, trying to deceive the Vietnamese people, in order to forcibly recruit puppet troops and slave laborers, and squeeze the wealth of the country to support their war of aggression.

The "People's Daily" pointed out: The U.S. imperialists have also inserted their blood-stained hands into the current negotiations in Paris between the French colonialists and their running dogs. Recently, they have paid more attention to expanding the puppet army and putting pressure on the French colonialists to let them directly train the puppet army. They plan to equip another sixty battalions of the puppet army during 1954-1955. They take advantage of the dilemma of the French colonialists and force the latter to loosen their control over the puppet regime, so that they can gradually directly support these puppet regimes. The U.S. imperialists also participated in planning the current negotiations in Paris between the French colonialists and their running dogs, attempting to prevent the upcoming Geneva Conference from discussing the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, and to deepen international tensions.

The "People's Daily" then emphasized: The purpose of this so-called negotiation in Paris is to provide favorable conditions for the French and American imperialists to massacre our people and prolong their dirty war.

### 越南“人民报”发表文章  斥责美法把保大傀儡装扮成“独立”的丑剧

    越南“人民报”发表文章
    斥责美法把保大傀儡装扮成“独立”的丑剧
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社北越十二日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表文章，评论法国殖民主义者及其走狗自三月八日以来在巴黎举行的谈判。
    该报写道：为了执行法国和美国帝国主义者的命令，傀儡总理宝禄已去法国和法国殖民主义者进行所谓谈判。宝禄在离开越南之前，曾无耻地声称，他将在两星期内使越南获得完全的独立。
    该报说：人们还记得，傀儡保大和阮文心曾在一九四九年三月八日签订了一项协定，这个协定承认法国殖民主义者在越南的统治，答应以人力和物质资源供应他们，以便把这个肮脏的战争拖延下去，可是，他们却把这个说成是独立。在一九五三年七月三日，法国殖民主义者又表演了一出修改这个协定的条款的喜剧，答应给予联邦成员国以独立。另一方面，他们布置了谈判，并用荒诞无稽的言词夸口说，完全的独立已经给予他们的傀儡了。
    该报接着说：现在在巴黎，法国殖民主义者及其走狗们又在上演同样的喜剧，法国反动派和傀儡的报纸及通讯社现在正为在巴黎的所谓谈判大吹大擂地进行宣传。但是，这个丑剧是欺骗不了公众的。越南人民，特别是过去几年中在法国占领区内生活在帝国主义者野蛮的剥削和压迫下的居民们，都看穿了敌人的诡计，敌后人民由于对于胡志明主席和越南民主共和国抗战政府的坚强信心，每天都在对帝国主义者和他们的走狗们进行着坚决的斗争。
    甚至法国资产阶级报纸“战斗报”也在二月十日承认，事实上，法国殖民者给保大政权准备的“独立”的外衣，只是在宝禄的演说中提到，而宝禄则是每个越南正直的公民所不齿的人。法国社会党党员安德烈·毕德在调查敌占区越南人民的意见回去后，最近在法国“人民报”发表文章说：保大—宝禄集团得不到人民的任何支持，而胡志明主席则是得到人民极大尊敬和爱戴的人，他象征着越南人民的真挚的希望。这些事实证明，即使在法国资产阶级集团中，也有许多人怀疑傀儡保大和宝禄的能力。
    另一方面，以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府的威信正在一天天地提高。越南人民军赢得的胜利，特别是最近的胜利以及寮国和高棉人民解放军所取得的成就，已在法国和美国帝国主义者中间造成很大的恐慌。在这种情况下，法国政府中的很多人物已表示他们愿意用和平方法解决印度支那问题。
    但是，法国政府中的好战分子和美国帝国主义者为了拖延印度支那的战争，仍企图积极实现他们
  “以越南人打越南人”和“以战养战”的阴谋。这说明了他们为什么必须要演出这种老牌滑稽剧，把这些傀儡们打扮起来，企图欺骗越南人民，以便强迫征募傀儡军和奴隶劳工，并榨取国家财富以供养他们的侵略战争。
    “人民报”指出：美帝国主义者也把他们血污的手插进目前法国殖民主义者及其走狗在巴黎的谈判中。近来他们更加注意扩大傀儡军队并对法国殖民主义者施加压力，好让他们来直接训练傀儡军。他们打算在一九五四至一九五五年期间再装备六十个营的傀儡军队。他们利用法国殖民主义者进退两难的处境，强迫后者放松对傀儡政权的控制，以便由他们来逐渐直接扶植这些傀儡政权。美帝国主义者还参与策划目前法国殖民主义者及其走狗在巴黎的谈判，企图阻止即将召开的日内瓦会议讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题，并加深国际紧张局势。
    “人民报”接着强调：在巴黎进行的这种所谓谈判，其目的就在于给法、美帝国主义者屠杀我们人民、把他们的肮脏战争拖下去提供有利条件。
