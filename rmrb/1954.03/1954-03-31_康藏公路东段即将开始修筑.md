Xinhua News Agency report: Large-scale construction of the eastern section of the Kangzang Highway (Changdu to Tazhao) is about to begin. Various preparations for the construction have been completed, and the road construction troops who have finished their winter training are heading towards the construction area in a steady stream. In the past winter and spring, the engineering department sent four survey teams to conduct a second survey of the construction route and key projects, and formulated the complete construction plan for the Kangzang Highway in 1954.

In January of this year, patriotic people of Tibetan ethnicity in Changdu formed support and transportation organizations at all levels. The road construction command also set up supply stations and land-water transfer stations on the main transportation lines. Clinic outposts and construction site hospitals have also been established successively. The health work team dispatched to the Changdu area by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government will also conduct mobile treatment in the construction area. The cultural department of the road construction troops has prepared various books and entertainment equipment for the soldiers. Film projection teams and literary and artistic work teams have also made plans for on-site screenings and performances.
