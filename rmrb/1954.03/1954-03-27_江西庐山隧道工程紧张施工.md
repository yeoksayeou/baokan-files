The Lushan Tunnel Project in Jiangxi is Undergoing Tense Construction

At the beginning of March, even as Lushan was experiencing snowy weather and temperatures of minus twenty degrees Celsius, the workers constructing Lushan began intense and arduous labor to welcome the heroic models who will come to Lushan for recuperation this summer.

On August 1st last year, the first highway in Lushan, the Lushan Highway, was completed. This year, at the end of the mountain highway, the work continues to excavate a tunnel seven meters high, eight meters wide, and ninety meters long. After passing through the tunnel, various light buses can smoothly travel to various scenic spots on the mountain. Currently, thirty meters of the tunnel have been cut open, and the hole has been dug ten meters deep. In order to strive for full operation by "June 1st", the workers have implemented three-shift operations and put forward the slogan of "fast drilling, fast opening, fast loading, and fast unloading." The workers have a high level of enthusiasm. Communist Youth League member Peng Shugong said: "The brilliance of the General Line shines on our mountain road construction work. We are determined to strive to complete the project by June 1st and welcome heroic models to the mountains for recuperation." The engineers will use higher artistic standards in the design to make Lushan even more beautiful.

    江西庐山隧道工程紧张施工
    三月初，庐山上还在零下二十度的风雪日子里。建设庐山的工人们，便展开了紧张艰苦的劳动，迎接今年夏天来到庐山休养的英雄模范。
    去年八月一日，庐山第一条公路——庐山公路筑成。今年，在登山公路的终点，继续开凿一条高七公尺、宽八公尺、长九十公尺的隧道，穿过隧道，各式轻便的公共汽车便能畅通山上的各个风景区。现在，隧道已切开三十公尺，凿洞深达十公尺。为了争取“六一”全部通车，工人们实行了三班作业，提出了“快钻、快开、快装、快卸”的口号。工人劳动热情很高。青年团员彭树功说：“总路线的光芒照耀着我们开山筑路工作，我们坚决争取六月一日完成工程任务，迎接英雄模范上山休养。”工程师们要以更高的艺术标准来设计，把庐山建设得更加美丽。
