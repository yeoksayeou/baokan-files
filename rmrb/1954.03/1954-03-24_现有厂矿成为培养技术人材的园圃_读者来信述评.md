Make Existing Factories and Mines Nurseries for Cultivating Technical Talents
——Reader Letters and Commentary
Lu Qing

Actively and systematically cultivating construction talents in production practice is an important task that existing enterprises in our country should undertake in the socialist construction cause. Existing factories and mines are the most practical and large-scale schools for cultivating construction talents. From readers' letters from various places, it can be seen that most factory and mine leaders can adopt various effective measures to actively cultivate construction talents for the country according to national needs and employee requirements. For example, from October 1952 to October 1953, Anshan Iron and Steel Company added a spare-time university, expanded a technical school, and eight spare-time middle schools. It also held more than 180 training classes of various forms, giving more than 37,700 employees a good opportunity to improve their political, professional, and cultural skills. In addition, it also helped employees sign more than 1,830 apprenticeship contracts. In that year, a total of more than 7,400 technical personnel and skilled workers graduated. Their technical level generally increased by one to two levels on the original basis. This technical force played a huge role in ensuring the completion and early completion of the national production plan.

However, some leaders of factory and mine enterprises ignored the needs of national construction and the urgent demands of employees, and adopted another attitude. For example, Ma Yongquan, chairman of the trade union of the Liaodong Machinery Third Factory, launched technical workers and apprentices to sign technical learning apprenticeship contracts according to the general demands of the workers, mutually guaranteeing good teaching and learning; the factory trade union supported this proposal. However, the party branch secretary poured cold water on them, saying: "I am afraid it will not work for our factory to sign apprenticeship contracts, right? On the one hand, we have no plan; on the other hand, if the apprentices' skills improve in the future and they need to be promoted, and the masters teach well and need to be rewarded, we don't have this money!" The factory director also refused on the pretext that the "Industrial Department would not approve." The leaders of Shandong Sulfuric Acid Plant regarded the training of apprentices as opposed to production tasks, believing that training apprentices was a burden and would affect production. Apprentices have not been able to get internship opportunities for a long time, and have been doing odd jobs for a long time, and sometimes there is simply no work to do. The administrative leaders did not pay attention to it. Instead of "organizing reading newspapers" to perfunctorily deal with the apprentices' urgent requirements for improving their skills, they criticized the apprentices for "purely technical viewpoints." In addition, some leaders of factory and mine enterprises shouted all day long that there were insufficient technical cadres and asked to add people. However, after the leading organs allocated graduates from colleges or secondary technical schools, they felt that these people lacked knowledge of production practice, and some also had some ideological problems, and it was not easy to use them for a while; these leading cadres did not adopt a positive attitude of helping and patiently educating the trainee technicians, so that they could correct their thinking, improve their level, and play a role in their work, but adopted a passive attitude of ignoring them, or not assigning work, or assigning work that was very inappropriate.

In our country's socialist construction cause, correspondingly cultivating construction talents is a very important task. Comrade Stalin said: "Any task, especially a huge task like our country's industrialization, cannot be realized without vigorous people, without new talents, without new construction cadres." In order to meet the needs of the ever-developing industrial construction, in addition to transferring cadres to enrich industrial departments and training new construction talents in schools, the country must also continuously cultivate new technical forces in existing factory and mine enterprises. This is not only to meet the needs of the existing enterprises themselves to develop production, but also to continuously transport cadres to the country's newly built enterprises. Therefore, the leading cadres of existing factories and mines must regard the cultivation of talents as a concrete work to implement the general line. While completing the national production plan, actively do it well. In this regard, all localism, backward conservatism, and the idea of enjoying the fruits of others' labor are harmful and must be corrected immediately. Every existing factory and mine should regard apprentices and trainees as the source of technical force development, cultivate them "like gardeners cultivate beloved fruit trees," and formulate a work plan for cultivating technical forces according to the specific conditions of their departments, and adopt effective methods such as running various spare-time schools, spare-time technical training classes, holding technical lectures, organizing technical research associations, and organizing the masses to sign apprenticeship contracts, so that our existing factory and mine enterprises become nurseries for cultivating new technical forces.

    使现有厂矿成为培养技术人材的园圃
    ——读者来信述评
    鲁青
    在生产实践中积极地、有计划地培养建设人材，是我国现有企业在社会主义建设事业中应该承担的重要任务之一。现有厂矿是最实际的和大规模的培养建设人材的学校，从各地读者的来信中看出：多数厂矿的领导者都能根据国家需要和职工要求，采取了各种有效办法，积极为国家培养建设人材。如鞍山钢铁公司在一九五二年十月至一九五三年十月，即增设了一个业余大学，扩大了一个技工学校、八个业余中学，还先后举办过一百八十来个各种形式的训练班，使三万七千七百余职工获得了提高政治、业务、文化的良好机会；此外，又帮助职工签订了一千八百三十多份师徒合同。在这一年中，先后出师和结业的技术人员和技术工人共有七千四百余人。他们的技术水平普遍在原有基础上提高一级到两级。这批技术力量对保证完成和提前完成国家生产计划起了巨大作用。
    但是，也有一些厂矿企业的领导者却漠视国家建设的需要和职工迫切的要求，而采取了另外一种态度。如辽东机械三厂车间工会主席马永全，曾根据工人们的普遍要求，发动技术工人和徒工们签订技术学习的师徒合同，互相保证教好、学好；该厂工会支持了这个建议。但是，党支部书记却给他们泼冷水说：“咱们厂子订师徒合同恐怕不行吧？一方面咱们没有计划；另一方面将来徒工技术提高了要升级，师傅教好了要给奖，咱们可没有这笔钱！”厂长也借口“工业厅不会批准”而拒绝了。山东制酸厂的领导者，把培养徒工和生产任务对立起来，认为培养徒工是累赘，会影响生产。徒工们一直得不到实习操作的机会，长期做勤杂工作，甚至有时根本没有活干。行政领导方面却不加理会，对于徒工提高技术的迫切要求，不是以“组织读报”来敷衍，就是批评徒工们是“单纯技术观点”。此外，还有些厂矿企业的领导者成天叫嚷着技术干部不足，要求添人。但是，当领导机关分配来高等学校或中等技术学校的毕业生以后，又觉得这些人缺乏生产实践的知识，有的还有着一些思想问题，用起来一时还不那么得心应手；这些领导干部对见习技术人员不是采取积极帮助和耐心教育的态度，使他们端正思想、提高水平，在工作中发挥作用，却采取了不闻不问的消极态度，甚至不给分配工作，或者是分配的工作很不恰当。
    在我们国家的社会主义建设事业中，相应地培养建设人材是一项十分重要的工作。斯大林同志说：“任何一个任务，特别是像我们国家工业化这样的巨大任务，如果没有生气勃勃的人，没有新的人材，没有新的建设干部，是不可能实现的。”为了满足日益发展的工业建设的需要，国家除了抽调干部充实工业部门和在学校里培养新的建设人材以外，还必须在现有厂矿企业中不断培养新生的技术力量。这不但是为了满足现有企业本身发展生产的需要，也是为着给国家新建企业源源不断地输送干部。因此，现有厂矿的领导干部必须把培养人材看作贯彻总路线的一项具体工作。在完成国家生产计划的同时，积极把它做好。在这方面，一切本位主义、落后保守和坐享其成的思想都是有害的，必须立即纠正。每个现有厂矿应该把徒工和见习人员看作技术力量发展的泉源，“像园丁培植心爱的果树一样”去培养他们，并根据本部门的具体情况订出培养技术力量的工作计划，采取开办各种业余学校、业余技术训练班、举办技术讲座、组织技术研究会、组织群众订立师徒合同等有效办法，使我们现有的厂矿企业变成培养新生技术力量的园圃。
