Shaanxi Refractory Materials Factory Completed

The Shaanxi Refractory Materials Factory, the largest in the Northwest region, was completed on March 8th. Refractory materials are one of the important materials in industrial production and construction. Chemical industries use them for furnace construction, kiln building, and equipment drying, and various heavy industries require a large amount of refractory materials for all types of boilers and chimneys. The valley near the Shaanxi Refractory Materials Factory contains crucible earth, a refractory raw material that can supply the factory for three hundred years. Soon, the factory will produce a large amount of refractory materials to meet the needs of industrial construction in the Northwest.

    陕西耐火材料厂建成
    西北区规模最大的陕西耐火材料厂已于三月八日建成。耐火材料是工业生产建设中的重要材料之一，化学工业中筑炉、建窑及装置干燥设备，各项重工业所用的各式锅炉、烟囱等，都需要大量的耐火材料。陕西耐火材料厂附近的山谷里，蕴藏着可供该厂三百年使用的耐火原料——坩土。不久，该厂将生产大量耐火材料供应西北工业建设的需要。
