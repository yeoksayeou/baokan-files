The grassroots election work in various parts of Guangdong Province has been launched in batches, closely integrated with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and spring plowing preparations. The Yuexi, Yuebei, Yuezhong, and Hainan areas held meetings from late January to mid-February to discuss and arrange the general election work. With the exception of the Yuedong area, the training of general election cadres in other areas of the province was largely completed by the end of February. The general election work in 136 key townships and towns in counties such as Suixi, Haikang, Maoming, Xinyi, and Yangjiang in the Yuexi area began in mid-February; the general election work in 91 key townships and towns in counties such as Yunan, Zhongshan, Shunde, and Boluo in the Yuezhong area also began in late February.

The general election work in key townships and towns in various parts of Guangdong Province relies on existing grassroots cadres to mobilize the masses. After the general election work team in Long'ai Township, Xuwen County, arrived in the township, they relied on the existing grassroots cadres to convene a township people's representative meeting to summarize work, affirmed past achievements, and then formulated a plan to combine production with general election work. This not only stabilized the emotions of the grassroots cadres but also greatly improved their enthusiasm, actively mobilizing the masses to participate in the general election activities. After the general election work team in Yangjing Township, Suixi County, arrived in the township, they also first summarized work with the existing grassroots cadres, affirmed achievements, pointed out shortcomings, and specifically analyzed the causes of the shortcomings, clarified responsibilities, and the district head assumed responsibility for those shortcomings that should be borne by higher authorities at the meeting. In this way, the grassroots cadres who had concerns dispelled their concerns and actively and proactively carried out the general election work with full confidence.

The general election work in key townships and towns in various parts of Guangdong Province generally implemented the principle of closely integrating the general election with production, subordinating to production, and promoting production. After the general election work team in Boluo County went to the countryside, they convened a meeting, starting with production, emphasizing that the general election must serve production, promote production with the general election, and carry out the general election work under the premise of doing a good job in production. A specific plan for combining the general election with production was also formulated at the meeting. Cadres and the masses were very satisfied, dispelling concerns that the general election would delay production. The general election work teams in various townships in the fourth district of Heyuan County led production during the day and carried out the general election at night. According to statistics from ten townships from February 25th to March 5th, a total of more than 4,700 people were mobilized to repair 116 small-scale water conservancy projects. According to statistics from another eleven townships, more than 3,800 people were mobilized to accumulate more than 100,000 dan of fertilizer. Because they were able to solve the urgent needs of the masses in production, the general election movement was launched rapidly and smoothly. In less than ten days, all townships in the district completed the population survey and voter registration work, and some townships also compiled voter groups and began the voter qualification review work. When the grassroots election key townships in Dianbai County started the general election work, the masses were busy preparing for spring plowing and were worried about not being able to repair water conservancy. The general election work team immediately publicized the general election, explained the significance of doing a good job in the general election for promoting production, and consulted with the masses to formulate a specific plan for repairing water conservancy, mobilizing and leading the masses to repair three water conservancy projects in a few days, which could irrigate more than 560 mu of fields. During the repair of water conservancy, population survey and voter registration work were combined. Because it was closely integrated with production, both cadres and the masses were very energetic. The population survey and voter registration work, which was originally planned to take three days, was completed in one day.

The general election work in key townships and towns in various parts of Guangdong Province has also closely combined the promotion of the general line, promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Lianjiang County's fifth district, Dongqiao, Huangzhu, Liangdong, and other nine townships combined the promotion of the general line to carry out general election propaganda, using the method of recalling and comparing the old and new regimes and the two roads, and by summarizing and introducing the experience of good local mutual aid groups, educating the masses to understand the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation and the importance of the general election, quickly setting off a upsurge of combining the mutual aid and cooperation movement to carry out the general election movement. Farmers in various townships have organized themselves under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. In the few days that the general election movement was launched in Huangzhu Township, six new mutual aid groups were organized, and many farmers were brewing to organize mutual aid groups. In Enping County's third district, Songbaigen Township and Taiping Township, the masses organized fourteen mutual aid groups in five days (for a total of fifty-six including the original ones), and the original mutual aid groups were gradually improved. In Lingtou Township, Wuchuan County, preparations were made to organize seven mutual aid groups in the past, but they had not matured after a long period of brewing. After this publicity and education and the specific help of the general election work team, they were quickly established.

    广东省普选工作密切结合生产分批展开
    广东省各地的基层选举工作，已结合互助合作运动和春耕准备工作陆续分批展开。粤西、粤北、粤中、海南等区于一月底到二月中旬，先后召开会议，讨论、布置了普选工作。全省除粤东区外，其他各区训练普选干部的工作已于二月底大致结束。粤西区遂溪、海康、茂名、信宜、阳江等县一百三十六个重点乡、镇的普选工作，已于二月中旬展开；粤中区郁南、中山、顺德、博罗等县九十一个重点乡、镇的普选工作，也在二月下旬先后开始。
    广东省各地重点乡、镇的普选工作，都是依靠原有基层干部发动群众来进行的。徐闻县龙爱乡普选工作队到乡后，即依靠原有基层干部召开乡人民代表会议，总结工作，肯定了过去的工作成绩，然后订出结合生产展开普选工作的计划。这样使基层干部不仅安定了情绪，而且大大提高了积极性，积极发动群众参加普选活动。遂溪县洋菁乡普选工作队到乡后，也是首先和原有基层干部总结工作，肯定成绩、指出缺点，并具体分析了缺点产生的原因，分清责任，并由区长在会上把那些应由上级负责的缺点承担起来。这样，使得原来有顾虑的基层干部，都打消了顾虑，满怀信心地积极主动地进行普选工作。
    广东省各地重点乡、镇的普选工作，一般都贯彻了普选密切结合生产、服从生产、推动生产的方针。博罗县普选工作队下乡后，即召开会议从谈生产入手，强调普选必须为生产服务，以普选推动生产，在搞好生产的前提下进行普选工作。会上并订出普选结合生产的具体计划。干部和群众都很满意，打消了怕普选耽误生产的顾虑。河源县第四区各乡的普选工作队都是白天领导生产，晚上搞普选。从二月二十五日起到三月五日止，据十个乡的统计，共发动群众四千七百多人，修好了一百一十六宗小型水利工程。另据十一个乡的统计，发动群众三千八百多人，积肥十万多担。由于能够解决群众生产上的迫切要求，普选运动得到迅速顺利的开展，不到十天时间，全区各乡都完成了人口调查、选民登记的工作，有的乡还编好选民小组，开始了选民资格审查工作。电白县基层选举重点乡在普选工作开始时，群众正忙于春耕准备工作，担心修不好水利，普选工作队即一面宣传普选，说明搞好普选对推动生产的意义，一面和群众商量订出修水利的具体计划，发动和领导群众在几天内修好了三宗水利，可以灌溉五百六十多亩田。在修水利当中，结合进行了人口调查和选民登记工作。由于密切结合了生产，干部和群众劲头都很大，人口调查和选民登记工作原来计划需要三天时间，竟在一天内完成了。
    广东省各地重点乡、镇的普选工作，还密切结合宣传总路线，推动了互助合作运动。廉江县第五区东桥、黄竹、良垌等九个乡结合宣传总路线来进行普选宣传，运用新旧政权、两条道路的回忆对比的方式，及通过总结和介绍当地好的互助组的经验，教育群众认识互助合作的优越性和普选的重要意义，很快便掀起了结合互助合作运动开展普选运动的热潮。各乡农民都在自愿互利的原则下纷纷组织起来。黄竹乡在普选运动开展的几天中便新组织了六个互助组，还有不少农民正在酝酿组织互助组。恩平县第三区松柏根乡、太平乡群众在五天内组织了十四个互助组（连原有的共五十六个），原有的互助组也逐步健全起来。吴川县岭头乡过去准备组织七个互助组，长期酝酿未成熟，经过这次宣传教育和普选工作队的具体帮助，很快便成立起来了。
