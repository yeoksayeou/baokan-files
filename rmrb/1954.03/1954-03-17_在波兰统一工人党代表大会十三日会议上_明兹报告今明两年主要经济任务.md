    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 16th: According to TASS, at the morning session of the Second Party Congress on the 13th, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Hilary Minc, delivered a report on the third item on the agenda, "The Main Economic Tasks for the Last Two Years (1954 and 1955) of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955)."

    He pointed out that the main economic tasks for 1954 and 1955 are: to increase agricultural production and provide vigorous assistance to agriculture for this purpose; to increase the production of consumer goods, paying special attention to improving their quality and increasing their variety; to further develop the production of means of production, paying special attention to the development of the country's raw material base; to develop the transportation industry, especially railway transportation, in line with the development of industrial and agricultural production; to make better use of existing technical equipment and greatly advance technology; to further improve labor productivity on the basis of new technology and improved labor organization; to rectify employment issues, paying special attention to ensuring agriculture's labor needs; to adjust the use of materials and improve the supply of material technology in order to reduce the cost of products; and finally, on the basis of the above measures, to further improve the living conditions of the working people by appropriately increasing the quantity of commodity circulation, improving the quality of goods, expanding housing construction and public utilities construction, and expanding the construction of social welfare and cultural institutions serving residents.

    Minc said that in the past four years, the amount of machinery and agricultural implements obtained by Polish agriculture has increased by one and a half times, but the level of our agricultural machinery manufacturing industry still cannot keep up with the ever-increasing demand of agriculture, nor can it keep up with the general level of development of the production of means of production, especially the general level of development of the machinery manufacturing industry. Therefore, the production of agricultural machinery and implements in 1955 should be more than double that of 1953. From 1954 to 1956, the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry will produce in large quantities 34 kinds of agricultural machinery and implements that are currently not produced domestically.

    Minc then talked about the issue of developing the production of consumer goods. He pointed out that the total output of the consumer goods industry in 1953 had increased by 99 percent compared with 1949. However, in the production of many major consumer goods, the tasks stipulated in the Six-Year Plan have not yet been fully completed. Compared with 1953, the production of meat, milk, and dairy products in 1955 should increase by 17 percent; cotton fabrics should increase by 12 percent; wool fabrics should increase by 11 percent; silk fabrics should increase by 20 percent; and the quality of textiles should be greatly improved.

    Minc said that our national economy can only be further developed on the basis of developing the means of production industry. In order to develop our entire national economy and the foundation of the national economy—the industry that produces the means of production—we must first develop and expand the production of raw materials, and secondly, systematically reduce our dependence on imports in terms of major raw materials by developing our own raw material base. Poland's coal production already ranks fifth in the world. Coal production in 1954 will increase to 2.5 times that of the pre-war level, which is more than the total coal production of France, Italy, and Belgium combined. Currently, the products of the machinery manufacturing industry have increased eightfold per capita compared with the pre-war period, and the production of machine tools has increased fourteenfold.

    Minc said that in order to further develop railway transportation, it is necessary to increase the production of railway vehicles, especially freight car wagons and heavy-duty freight locomotives. The electrification of the Warsaw-Silesia line should be completed, and ensure that the electrified railways have sufficient domestic vehicles.

    Minc pointed out that Poland's technology has developed vigorously during the Six-Year Plan period, the degree of mechanization has been greatly improved, and new working methods have been adopted in all national economic sectors. Soviet assistance plays a decisive role in Poland's technological progress. In 1954 and 1955, we should learn to use modern technology better. Striving for technological progress is one of the main keys to developing our entire national economy and one of the basic sources for improving the living standards of the working people.

    Minc pointed out that compared with 1953, the planned increase in labor productivity in various sectors in 1955 is as follows: about 16 percent in industry, 16 percent in construction, 8 percent in railway transportation, and about 20 percent in state-owned farms. The main key to increasing labor productivity is socialist competition. Therefore, our important task is to comprehensively help carry out the competition movement, organize and support the initiatives of the working people.

    Minc emphasized that this congress has put forward a task: to increase the actual wages of workers and the income of laboring peasants by 15 to 20 percent in two years compared with 1953, and to increase the volume of commodity circulation by about 25 percent compared with 1953. This is a task with great responsibility. We have all the necessary conditions to complete this task.

    在波兰统一工人党代表大会十三日会议上
    明兹报告今明两年主要经济任务
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员希·明兹，在第二次党代表大会十三日上午会议上，就第三项议程“六年计划（一九五零——一九五五年）最后两年（一九五四年和一九五五年）的主要经济任务”作了报告。
    他指出：一九五四年和一九五五年的主要经济任务是：增加农业生产，并为此而对农业进行大力援助；增加日用品生产，特别注意提高其质量和增加其种类；进一步发展生产资料的生产，特别注意发展本国的原料基地；配合工农业生产的发展，相应地发展运输业，特别是铁路运输业；更好地利用现有的技术设备，把技术向前大大推进一步；在新的技术和改善劳动组织的基础上进一步提高劳动生产率；整顿就业问题，特别注意保证农业对劳动力的需要；调整对材料的使用和改进物质技术的供应，以降低产品的成本；最后，以上述措施为基础，用适当地增加商品流通的数量、改善商品质量、扩大住宅建设和公用事业建设、扩大为居民服务的社会福利和文化机关的建设等方法，来进一步改善劳动人民的生活状况。
    明兹说：过去四年中，波兰农业得到的机器和农具已增加了一倍半，但是我国农业机器制造业的水平仍然赶不上农业不断增长的需求，赶不上生产资料生产发展的一般水平，特别是机器制造业的发展的一般水平。因此，一九五五年农业机器和农具的生产应增加为一九五三年的二倍以上，从一九五四年到一九五六年，农业机器制造业将大批生产三十四种目前国内尚不能生产的农业机器和农具。
    明兹接着谈到了发展日用品生产的问题。他指出：一九五三年日用品工业的总产量已比一九四九年增加了百分之九十九。但是，在许多主要日用品的生产方面，还没有能全部完成六年计划规定的任务。和一九五三年相比，一九五五年肉类、乳类和乳类制品的生产应增加百分之十七；棉织品应增加百分之十二；毛织品应增加百分之十一；丝织品应增加百分之二十；纺织品的质量要大加改进。
    明兹说：我国的国民经济只有在发展生产资料工业的基础上才能得到进一步的发展。为了要使我们整个国民经济和国民经济的基础——生产生产资料的工业得到发展，我们首先要发展和扩大原料的生产，其次要以发展本国的原料基地的方法来有系统地减少在主要原料方面对进口的依赖性。波兰的煤产量已占世界的第五位，一九五四年的煤产量将增为战前的二点五倍，即比法国、意大利和比利时的煤产量的总和还要多。目前机器制造业的产品按人口计算比战前增加了八倍，工作母机的生产增加了十四倍。
    明兹说：为了进一步发展铁路运输，必须增加铁路车辆的生产，特别是货车车皮和重型运货机车的生产。应当完成华沙—西里西亚线的电气化，保证电气化铁路有足够的国产车辆。
    明兹指出，波兰的技术在六年计划期间得到蓬勃的发展，机械化程度大大提高，在一切国民经济部门中采用了新的工作方法。苏联的援助在波兰的技术进步方面起着决定性的作用。在一九五四到一九五五年内，应学习更好地使用现代化技术。为技术上的进步而奋斗，是发展我国整个国民经济的主要关键之一，是提高劳动人民生活水平的基本根源之一。
    明兹指出：和一九五三年比较，一九五五年各部门劳动生产率计划要提高的情况如下：工业方面约提高百分之十六，建筑业方面提高百分之十六，铁路运输方面提高百分之八，国营农场方面约提高百分之二十。提高劳动生产率的主要关键是社会主义竞赛。因此，我们的重要任务就是全面地帮助开展竞赛运动，组织和支持劳动人民的创举。
    明兹强调说，这一次代表大会提出一项任务：要在两年之内使工人的实际工资和劳动农民的收入比一九五三年增加百分之十五到二十，商品流转额比一九五三年约提高百分之二十五。这是一项责任重大的任务。我们有一切必要条件来完成这项任务。
