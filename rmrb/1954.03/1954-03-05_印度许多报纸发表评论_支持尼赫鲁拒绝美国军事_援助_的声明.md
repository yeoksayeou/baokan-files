Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 4th: Indian newspapers on the 3rd generally supported Prime Minister Nehru's statement rejecting American military "aid," and condemned the American military "aid" to Pakistan.

    The "Hindustan Standard" editorial stated: "India cannot participate in any plan whose ultimate purpose is to sever ties with the friendly neighbor China through military means. India will also not accept any aid that makes such an agreement a condition. India seeks peaceful relations and is unwilling to join the mad arms race."

    The "Times of India" editorial said: "Because the United States believes that it is secure only by expanding the area of the Cold War, this is a threat to the peace of Asian countries. This expansion means an obvious increase in the danger of them being drawn into war. This is a threat to their independence because if they allow themselves to be directly involved in the Cold War, they must obey those who implement Cold War policies."

    The "Indian Express" editorial stated: The U.S. "giving Pakistan military 'aid' on the precondition that an agreement be concluded between Karachi and Ankara, this approach is suitable for the strategy of letting Asians fight Asians. Separate military alliances that tend to divide the region into several hostile camps are completely contrary to the ideals and principles of the United Nations. Prime Minister Nehru said: 'India does not intend to abandon or sell its freedom for any purpose or under any compulsion,' which will be met with a heartfelt response from everyone."

    The "Hindustan Times" said in an editorial: "Since the United States has no reason to refute India's accusation that 'aid may create, foster, and encourage conditions for aggression,' the explanation for this ill-considered action must be sought in the global strategy that Washington is pursuing. To the Pentagon, many countries on the edge of communist areas are just locations where bases can be built and manpower supplied."

    India's local newspapers also unanimously welcomed Nehru's statement and strongly condemned American aggressive conspiracies. Raipur's "Mahakoshal" denounced the U.S. military alliance with Pakistan as an act of undermining the UN Charter. Indore's "Nai Bharat" criticized Eisenhower's suggestion to give India military "aid" as a conspiracy to infringe upon India's sovereignty. Kanpur's "Forward" demanded that American spies be removed not only from Kashmir but from all of India.

    印度许多报纸发表评论
    支持尼赫鲁拒绝美国军事“援助”的声明
    【新华社新德里四日电】印度各报三日的社论，普遍支持印度总理尼赫鲁拒绝接受美国军事“援助”，并谴责美国给巴基斯坦以军事“援助”的声明。
    “印度斯坦旗报”的社论说：“印度不能够参加任何最终目的是要通过军事手段与友好的邻国中国决裂的计划。印度也不会接受任何以这种协议作为条件的援助。印度所寻求的是和平关系，它不愿加入疯狂的军备竞赛。”
    “印度时报”的社论说：“由于美国认为要扩大冷战地区，它才有安全，所以这是对亚洲国家的和平的威胁。这种扩大意味着它们被卷入战争的危险的显然增加。这是对它们的独立的威胁，因为要是让自己直接被卷入冷战的话，它们就要听命于那些执行冷战政策的人。”
    “印度快报”的社论说：美国“给予巴基斯坦军事‘援助’的先决条件是喀喇蚩与安卡拉之间缔结协定，这种做法是适合让亚洲人打亚洲人的战略的。有使这个地区分裂成为几个敌对阵营的倾向的单独的军事联盟是与联合国的理想和原则完全背道而驰的。尼赫鲁总理说：‘印度不打算为任何目的或在任何强制之下放弃或出卖其自由’，这句话将得到每一个人的衷心响应。”
    “印度斯坦时报”在社论中说：“由于美国没有任何理由可以反驳印度提出的‘援助可能为创造、助长和鼓励侵略的条件’的指责，对于这个欠思考的行动的解释必须到华盛顿正奉行的全球战略中去寻求。对五角大楼说来，在共产主义地区边缘上的许多国家，只是许多个可以建筑基地与供应人力的地点。”
    印度各地方报纸也一致欢迎尼赫鲁的声明，并强烈谴责美国的侵略阴谋。赖普尔的“马哈科沙尔报”指斥美国与巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟是破坏联合国宪章的行径。印度尔的“新印度报”斥责艾森豪威尔给予印度以军事“援助”的建议是企图侵犯印度主权的阴谋。康波尔的“前进报”要求把美国特务不仅从克什米尔，而且从全印度清除出去。
