    The New Barag Left Banner, Solon Banner, Chen Barag Banner, and New Barag Right Banner on the Hulunbuir Grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region successively held their first sessions of the People's Congresses in late February.

    A total of two hundred and sixty-eight representatives attended the People's Congresses of each banner. The representatives were outstanding individuals elected in the general elections last winter, including Mongolian, Solon, Tibetan, and Han ethnicities, representing herders, herdbowners, handicraftsmen, and lamas. During the congresses of each banner, the representatives carefully discussed the work reports of the People's Government, studied future work plans, and carefully elected the members of the People's Government Committee of each banner, the Banner Heads and Deputy Banner Heads, and the representatives to attend the Eastern District People's Congress. When studying pastoral area work in each banner, the representatives listened to reports on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, and unanimously agreed that livestock production is an integral part of the country's economic construction during the transition period. In the future, efforts should be made to increase the number of livestock and improve livestock quality to support national industrial construction and meet the needs of cities and rural areas for livestock products. To this end, the People's Congresses of each banner made resolutions to strengthen pastoral area production. The resolutions of each banner emphasized that at present, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize herders to organize, take various measures, and do a good job in spring disaster prevention and animal protection and lambing preparations, so that the herds can smoothly survive the snowstorm period and reproduce safely. Each banner requested to jointly strive to complete the task of continuing to reproduce more than 643,000 cattle, horses, camels, and sheep in the entire Hulunbuir pastoral area this year. In addition, the representatives also put forward more than 1,000 proposals on improving livestock production, supply and marketing cooperation, cultural, educational, and health issues based on the requirements and suggestions of the people of all ethnic groups in each Sumu (district). These proposals were studied and discussed by the congresses of each banner and answered and dealt with.

    During the congress, the people's representatives of each banner expressed satisfaction with the past work of the People's Government. Under the leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Hulunbuir pastoral area extensively carried out mutual aid in labor, improved technology, and overcame natural disasters last year, successfully completing the patriotic task of increasing and protecting livestock. The number of livestock in the four banners of the pastoral area has increased by two times compared with the initial period of liberation, with an average of sixty-five head of livestock of all sizes per person. Supply and marketing cooperatives, livestock product processing plants, schools, and hospitals have been established in each banner, and people's lives have been greatly improved.

    呼伦贝尔草原四个旗分别召开人民代表大会
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上的新巴尔虎左翼旗、索伦旗、陈巴尔虎旗和新巴尔虎右翼旗，在二月下旬先后举行了首届第一次人民代表大会。
    出席各旗人民代表大会的代表共计二百六十八名。代表们是在去年冬天普选中选出的优秀人物，包括蒙古、索伦、藏、汉等民族成份，代表着牧民、牧主、手工业者和喇嘛等各个方面。在各旗大会时间，代表们认真地讨论了人民政府的工作报告，研究了今后的工作计划，并且慎重地选出了各旗人民政府委员、正副旗长和出席东部区人民代表大会的代表。各旗在研究牧区工作时，代表们听取了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务的报告，一致认为畜牧业生产是国家过渡时期经济建设的一个组成部分，今后应该大力增殖牲畜头数，提高牲畜质量，支援国家工业建设和供应城市、农村对畜产品的需要。为此，各旗人民代表大会都作出了加强牧区生产的决议。各旗的决议中都着重指出：目前要大力发动牧民组织起来，采取各种措施，做好春季防灾保畜和接羔准备工作，使畜群顺利度过风雪期，安全地进行繁殖。各旗要求今年共同争取完成呼伦贝尔整个牧区继续繁殖牛、马、骆驼、羊六十四万三千多头的任务。此外，代表们还根据各苏木（区）各族人民群众的要求和建议，提出了一千多件有关改进畜牧生产、供销合作、文教卫生等问题的提案，这些提案都由各旗大会加以研究讨论，并作了答复和处理。
    大会期间，各旗人民代表对于人民政府过去的各项工作都表示满意。呼伦贝尔牧区各族人民，去年在中共各级党委和人民政府领导下，广泛进行了劳动互助，改进技术，战胜自然灾害等工作，胜利地完成了爱国增畜保畜任务。牧区四个旗的牲畜头数已较解放初期增加了两倍，平均每人拥有大小牲畜六十五头。各旗都建立了供销合作社、畜产品加工厂、学校和医院，人民生活有了很大改善。（新华社）
