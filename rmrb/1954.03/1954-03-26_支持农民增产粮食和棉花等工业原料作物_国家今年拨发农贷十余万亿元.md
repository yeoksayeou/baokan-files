Supporting Farmers in Increasing Grain, Cotton, and Other Industrial Raw Material Crops
The State Allocates Over 10 Trillion Yuan in Agricultural Loans This Year
In 1954, despite the need for substantial funds to develop industry, the state allocated a huge sum of over 10 trillion yuan (including loans issued last year that have not yet been recovered) to farmers to support them in increasing the production of grain, cotton, other industrial raw materials, and specialty crops. Currently, preparations for issuing the loans are underway in various regions, and lending has already begun in areas where the spring plowing season has arrived earlier.

In order to ensure that this year's agricultural loans serve the development of agricultural production and the socialist transformation of the small-farmer economy, the People's Bank of China, in accordance with the State Council's guiding principles on issuing agricultural loans, issued an instruction outlining the tasks of this year's agricultural loan work: actively supporting state-owned agriculture and promoting the steady development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement; helping poor farmers solve the difficulties of production fund turnover, and gradually guiding them onto the road of mutual aid and cooperation; and at the same time, strengthening support for rural handicraft production and increasing the supply of means of production and means of livelihood to rural areas. The instruction pointed out: agricultural production cooperatives should be given appropriate and timely short-term loans to help them add general means of production, and according to production needs and the state's financial strength, gradually increase loans with longer terms to help them gradually carry out agricultural capital construction and production technology reforms, and increase public ownership of the means of production. Loans to agricultural mutual aid groups should be used to add draught animals, farm implements, and increase fertilizer to support their consolidation and development. Poor farmers participating in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations should be given care and support so that they can gradually improve farming conditions and rise together. Individual farmers who have not yet joined agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations, mainly poor farmers, should be helped with loans to overcome difficulties in production and life, avoid usurious exploitation, actively produce, and gradually be guided onto the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Currently, in accordance with this principle and in combination with local conditions, most regions have determined the focus of loans and are paying attention to achieving a reasonable distribution between organized farmers and individual farmers. In the Southwest region, more than 95 percent of agricultural loans are given to organized farmers and individual farmers, of which 40 percent are loans with a term of one to three years. In Shandong Province, out of nearly 1 trillion yuan in agricultural loans this year, more than 770 billion yuan is given to agricultural production cooperatives for farmland capital construction and adding production tools, helping year-round mutual aid groups purchase public means of production, and helping temporary mutual aid groups and individual farmers solve production difficulties. In addition to helping state-owned farms, agricultural machinery stations, and collective farms solve the difficulties of insufficient funds in production, Shanxi Province focuses on supporting newly established agricultural production cooperatives to increase livestock, fertilizer, larger agricultural implements, and to build water conservancy projects and improve technology. Zhejiang Province has also decided to give organized farmers special capital construction loans with a term of one year. Henan Province has specifically allocated 50 billion yuan from loans to help households in difficulty in rural areas.

This year, the People's Bank will also allocate a portion of agricultural loans to credit cooperatives to help them grow and develop, in order to more effectively squeeze out and combat usury. In order to help handicraftsmen, especially handicraft production cooperatives, increase production and supply farmers with more means of production and means of livelihood, various regions will also lend a portion of loans to handicraftsmen.

This year, various regions will simplify loan procedures and facilitate farmers' withdrawals when issuing agricultural loans. The Jiangxi Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China instructed its subordinates to select a township as a pilot project before issuing loans this spring to create a set of loan procedures suitable for rural conditions to guide the overall work.

### 支持农民增产粮食和棉花等工业原料作物  国家今年拨发农贷十余万亿元

    支持农民增产粮食和棉花等工业原料作物
    国家今年拨发农贷十余万亿元
    一九五四年，国家在发展工业需要大量资金的情况下，拨出十余万亿元的巨款（包括去年贷出还没有收回的贷款在内）贷给农民，支持农民增产粮食、棉花和其他工业原料及特产作物。目前，各地正在作发放贷款的准备工作，春耕生产季节到来较早的地区已开始贷放。
    为使今年的农业贷款服务于发展农业生产和对小农经济实行社会主义改造，中国人民银行根据中央人民政府政务院关于发放农业贷款的指示原则，发出了一个指示，指出今年农业贷款工作的任务是：积极扶持国营农业，促进农业互助合作运动稳步发展；帮助贫困农民解决生产资金周转的困难，并逐步引导他们走上互助合作的道路；同时加强扶植农村手工业生产，增加对农村生产资料和生活资料的供应。指示指出：对农业生产合作社既要适当、及时地贷给短期的贷款，帮助添置一般生产资料，也要根据生产需要和国家资金力量，逐渐增加贷款期较长的贷款，扶助其逐步进行农业基本建设和生产技术改革，增加公有生产资料。对农业互助组的贷款应用以添置耕畜、农具和增加肥料，扶持其巩固和发展。对于参加农业互助合作组织的贫困农民，应予以关怀扶持，使他们能逐步改善耕作条件，共同上升。对暂时还没有参加农业互助合作组织的个体农民，主要是贫困农民，要贷款帮助他们克服生产上和生活上的困难，避免高利贷剥削，积极生产，并逐步引导他们走向互助合作的道路。现在，各地根据这一原则，结合本地情况，大都已确定贷款重点，并注意做到组织起来的农民和个体农民之间的合理分配。西南区百分之九十五以上的农业贷款是贷给有组织的农民和个体农民的，其中有百分之四十是贷款期为一年到三年的贷款。山东省在今年近一万亿元的农业贷款中，有七千七百多亿元是贷给农业生产合作社进行农田基本建设和增添生产工具，帮助常年互助组购置公共生产资料以及帮助临时互助组和个体农民解决生产上的困难。山西省的贷款除用以帮助国营农场、农业机器站和集体农庄解决生产中资金不足的困难外，着重扶助新建的农业生产合作社增加牲畜、肥料、较大农具和兴修水利，改良技术。浙江省还决定特别给予组织起来的农户以贷款期为一年的基本建设贷款。河南省专门从贷款中拨出五百亿元，用以帮助农村中的困难户。
    今年，人民银行还将在农业贷款中拨出一部分贷给信用合作社，帮助其成长发展，以便更有力地排挤和打击高利贷。为了帮助手工业者特别是手工业生产合作社提高生产，供应农民更多的生产资料和生活资料，各地还将以一部分贷款贷给手工业者。
    今年，各地在发放农业贷款中，将简化贷放手续，便利农民取款。人民银行江西省分行指示所属在今春发放贷款前，要选择一个乡作试点，创造一套适合农村情况的贷款手续，以指导全面。
