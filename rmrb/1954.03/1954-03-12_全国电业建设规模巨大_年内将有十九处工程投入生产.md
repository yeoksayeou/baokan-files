    National Power Industry Construction on a Grand Scale
    Nineteen Projects to be Put into Production This Year

    [This Newspaper's Report] The basic construction scale of the national power industry is huge this year, with total investment increasing by 21.8% compared to last year. Among them, there are dozens of new, renovated, continued, and restored power stations; and even more transmission and transformation projects. At the same time, in order to adapt to future development needs, there is also a lot of surveying, site selection, and design work. This year, there are 24 key power industry projects, of which seven are projects aided by the Soviet Union.
    With the gradual development of the national construction cause, the demand for electricity is increasing day by day. This year, the national electricity demand increased by 15% compared to last year. Therefore, the state must build power stations at a faster rate to meet the growing needs. In order to ensure the completion of the basic construction tasks in 1954, the General Bureau of Electricity Management of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry decided to improve the organization and leadership of basic construction, and to concentrate the design and construction units, which are currently led separately by the major regional electricity management bureaus, under the direct leadership of specialized design and construction management bureaus, so as to achieve balanced dispatch on a national scale and more effectively leverage the potential power of existing basic construction. In 1953, the most important shortcoming in the basic construction of the power industry system was that it did not fully meet the "century-long plan, quality first" requirements put forward by the state. Therefore, this year, the staff and workers of various basic construction units in the power industry system must establish three basic ideas: First, further implement the idea of comprehensively completing tasks with quality as the main focus; truly achieve "good, economical, fast, and safe." Second, all units must actively cooperate and work together to serve the completion of engineering tasks. Third, strengthen foresight and strengthen planning management.
    About nineteen units in the national power industry system can start generating electricity in whole or in part this year. It is estimated that the increased production capacity of thermal power generation throughout the year will be 172% of the new power generation capacity put into production in 1953. Several giant turbine generators installed in the Northeast region, including two machines that can generate electricity this year, can adequately supply electricity to the metallurgical industry, machinery manufacturing industry, and coal mining industry. The expanded thermal power plant in Tianjin, after generating electricity in the first half of this year, will be of great significance for supplying industrial and lighting electricity to the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan areas. The Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will partially generate electricity by the end of November this year to supply electricity to the Heavy Machinery Plant, Jingwei Textile Machinery Plant, and chemical plants. The Chongqing 507 Power Plant will generate electricity in March and April this year, which will provide preconditions for the further development of the iron and steel smelting industry, coal mining industry, machinery industry, and dyeing and weaving factories in the Southwest region.

    全国电业建设规模巨大
    年内将有十九处工程投入生产
    【本报讯】　全国电力工业今年基本建设规模巨大，全部投资比去年增加了二十一点八。其中新建、改建、续建和恢复的电站共几十项；送变电工程项目更多。同时为了适应将来发展的需要，还有不少勘测、选厂、设计的工作。今年电力工业的重点工程有二十四处，其中七处是苏联帮助建设的工程。
    国家建设事业的逐步发展，对电力的需要量逐日增加。今年全国需要电量比去年增加了百分之十五。因此，国家必须以更快的速度建设电站，以适应日益增长的需要。为了保证完成一九五四年的基本建设任务，中央燃料工业部电业管理总局决定改善基本建设的组织领导，将目前由各大区电业管理局分散领导的设计、施工单位，统一集中由设计和施工的专业管理局直接领导，以便全国范围的平衡调度，更有效地发挥现有基本建设的潜在力量。一九五三年，电业系统基本建设在施工当中最主要的缺点：是没有完全达到国家提出的“百年大计，质量第一”的要求，因而今年电业系统各基本建设单位的职工，必须树立三个基本思想：第一，进一步贯彻以质量为主的全面完成任务的思想；真正做到“又好又省又快又安全”。第二，各单位必须主动配合协作，共同为完成工程任务而服务。第三，加强预见性，加强计划管理工作。
    全国电业系统今年年内能全部或部分开始发电的单位约有十九处左右，预计全年火力发电增加的生产能力，为一九五三年新投入生产的发电能力的百分之一百七十二。东北地区安装的数台巨型透平发电机，其中有两台机器今年可以发电，可充足供应金属冶炼工业、机器制造业、煤矿工业等的用电。天津扩建的火力发电厂，今年上半年发电后，对供应北京、天津、唐山地区工业和照明用电有着重大意义。太原电热厂将于今年十一月底部分发电，以供应重型机器厂，经纬纺织机械厂及化工厂等的电力需要。重庆五○七电厂，将于今年三、四月份发电，它将给西南区的钢铁冶炼工业、煤矿工业、机械工业、染织工厂等的进一步发展提供先决条件。
