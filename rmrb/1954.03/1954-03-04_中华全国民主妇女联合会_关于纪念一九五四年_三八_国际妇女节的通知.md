    Notice from the All-China Women's Federation
    Regarding the Commemoration of the 1954 "March 8th" International Women's Day

    (1) The political task for women's federations at all levels to mobilize women to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day this year should be to continue to deeply and specifically publicize the general line and general task of the country during the transition period to the broad masses of women, and to educate women to clearly recognize that only by implementing and realizing this general line and building China into a great socialist country can the thorough emancipation of women be further realized. Only when women and men, together, promote the spirit of loving the motherland and loving socialism, contribute all their energy and wisdom from their different posts, work selflessly, and struggle arduously, can they build a beautiful motherland and gradually transition to socialism. Therefore, when commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, women and men should be mobilized to work together, with one heart and one mind, to strive to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and gradually realize the country's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a considerable period of time, and to build our country into a great socialist country.

    In cities and industrial and mining areas, in conjunction with the production plans of industrial and mining enterprises, and in light of the ideological situation of female workers, female staff members, and family members of workers and staff, continue to deeply publicize the general line and general task of the transition period, focusing on explaining that the realization of the country's socialist industrialization can promote the modernization of agriculture and transportation, can establish and strengthen a modernized national defense, can guarantee the gradual completion of the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, can make our country a great and prosperous socialist country, and can make the people and women of the whole country live a happier and better life. Therefore, female workers, female technicians, and female staff members should be called upon to raise their socialist awareness and strive to build socialist industry; female employees of private industrial and commercial enterprises should actively assist the state in the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce; they should be called upon to enthusiastically participate in labor competitions, abide by labor discipline, cherish state property, learn advanced working methods, learn from the spirit of selfless labor of Soviet women, seize key points, find tricks, tap potential, increase product quantity, improve product quality, and reduce product costs, and strive to complete and over fulfill the state production plan. Family members of workers and staff should be called upon to serve production, study hard, improve their socialist awareness, unite and help each other, do a good job in housework, ensure that workers and staff attend work on time and rest on time, and encourage and assist workers and staff to complete and over fulfill the production plans of industrial and mining enterprises.

    In rural areas, in conjunction with local efforts to develop and establish agricultural producers' cooperatives, develop and consolidate mutual aid teams, mobilize the masses to prepare for spring plowing and production, and develop supply and marketing and credit cooperation, deeply and specifically publicize the general line and general task of the transition period to rural women, and publicize that agricultural cooperation is the only way to gradually realize the state's socialist transformation of agriculture. It should be explained that the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement can open up broad avenues for the vast number of rural women to participate in agricultural production, and create fundamental conditions for gradually improving the economic status of women and improving their material and cultural life. It should be explained that the active participation of the broad masses of rural women in the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement is of great significance for promoting agricultural cooperation, gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, improving agricultural productivity, increasing crop yields, and providing more grain and raw material crops needed for the socialist industrialization cause; women should be mobilized to actively support and participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives, and work with male farmers to prepare for spring plowing and production, and strive to increase the production of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other crops in 1954. The spirit of selfless labor and the happy life of female members of Soviet collective farms should be publicized, and rural women should be called upon to learn from the example of Soviet women and actively strive to build a socialist and beautiful life.

    The general line of the transition period should continue to be publicized to women from all walks of life and housewives in urban and rural areas, calling on them to do their best to complete the production, work and study plans of their departments, industries, schools or regions, actively purchase national economic construction bonds, and serve the motherland's construction directly or indirectly. Family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel should be educated to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, work hard in production, and all sectors of society should be educated to respect family members of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and conscientiously do a good job in preferential treatment. In both cities and villages, in conjunction with the work of publicizing the general line, and in light of the ideological situation of the masses, the Marriage Law should continue to be publicized, correctly interpreting the true meaning of equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, and protection of the interests of women and children, so that the Marriage Law can be further implemented among the masses.

    Women should be made aware of the great strength and unbreakable friendship of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and continue to strengthen and consolidate unity with all peace-loving people and women around the world, oppose warmongers, and strive to further ease international tensions and defend the motherland's construction and world peace.

      (2) Specific methods for commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day in various places may be determined by the working committees of the All-China Women's Federation in the major administrative areas and the women's federations of provinces and cities, according to local conditions, and after seeking instructions from the local Party committees. During commemorative activities, attention should be paid to purposefully commending and rewarding model figures among women from all walks of life, and appropriately establishing advanced women flag-bearers in various industries and professions. At commemorative rallies, advanced figures among female workers or farmers can be invited to speak, and if there are representatives who have visited the Soviet Union in the local area, they can also be invited to give reports on the lives of Soviet women. In order to enhance unity between female workers and farmers, in areas where factories and mines are located, meetings, get-togethers, etc. of female workers and farmers should be held as much as possible without hindering production, to introduce production experience and living conditions to each other, or to invite advanced figures among female workers and farmers to exchange reports of model deeds. In preparing for the "March 8th" festival publicity work, the women's federations in various places should pay attention to uniting with local propaganda organs, cultural and artistic groups, and other relevant units of people's organizations to formulate publicity work plans for commemorating the "March 8th" International Women's Day, so as to carry out more extensive and in-depth publicity to the masses of women through the commemorative activities of the "March 8th" International Women's Day.
