Huang Zhongba Awarded the Title of "First-Class Model Grain Custodian" in Baise County for Managing Three Million Jin of Grain for Two Years Without Mold, Rot, or Insect Damage

The young grain custodian Huang Zhongba of the Luosuo Warehouse in Baise District, Baise County, Guangxi Province, has managed over 3.3 million jin of grain in the past two years. Not only has none of this grain suffered from mold, rot, or insect infestation, but the loss has also been minimal. As a result, Huang Zhongba has been awarded the honorary title of "First-Class Model Grain Custodian" in the entire county.

In January 1952, Huang Zhongba became a grain custodian at the Tangxing Warehouse. It was the time when public grain was being stored in the warehouse. He was the only cadre in the warehouse, and the storage rooms were very dilapidated. The district government had originally stored over 1,000 jin of grain in the warehouse, but due to poor storage, it had become heavily infested with rice weevils and moths. Huang Zhongba, who came from a poor peasant background, deeply understood the value of grain and the relationship between grain work and national industrial construction. Therefore, he resolved to overcome all difficulties and store the grain well.

In the days leading up to the storage of public grain, he first carried out cleaning and disinfection work, cleaning up insect corpses, rice weevils, and spider webs, and applying lime wash. When the public grain was stored, he stored the good and inferior grains separately. After the grain was stored, he regularly monitored the changes in the grain, insisting on testing the grain temperature every three days. During the Yangmei plum rain season or when the climate changed dramatically, he measured the temperature once a day; he conducted a comprehensive inspection every seven days; he tested the moisture content of the grain every half month or month. If he found that the moisture content exceeded 3.5% of the grain's moisture level, he would immediately ventilate the grain to prevent it from heating up.

Huang Zhongba also paid attention to the cleanliness of the warehouse. He swept the granary every day and often "crawled under the warehouse" to sweep the bottom of the warehouse clean, preventing insects from hiding. When he found rats entering and exiting the granary, he climbed to the bottom of the warehouse to block the rat holes with small stones and then applied lime wash. He also borrowed several iron cats from nearby farmers to trap rats. From April to August of the previous year, he eliminated forty to fifty rats through trapping and other methods, reducing the loss of state-stored grain. One night, heavy hailstorms damaged several places on the warehouse roof, and rainwater leaked into the warehouse. He got up in the middle of the night, braved the hailstorm, and covered the grain with more than twenty bamboo mats by himself. The next day, he inspected and found that more than 5,000 jin of grain had been wetted by the rain, so he immediately took measures to dry it, preventing the grain from rotting.

Because of his diligent protection of the state's grain, the 350,000 jin of grain stored in the Tangxing Warehouse for more than a year did not heat up, become moldy, or become infested with rice weevils or moths. Later, he was transferred to the Luosuo Warehouse in Baise District, where he had to manage 1.5 million jin of grain alone, and he felt an even greater responsibility. Regardless of day or night, rain or shine, he carefully took care of the state's grain. Last June, he was sick for a week but continued to work while ill. Later, the amount of grain stored increased compared to before, and the county grain department sent Li Rongwei to assist in the work. He and Li Rongwei worked together very well, jointly ensuring that more than 2 million jin of rice did not experience heating, mold, or insect infestation. In November, public grain and purchased grain were successively stored in the warehouse. When he saw grain spilled at the weighing area, he thought, "Reducing the loss of even one grain will increase the country's construction strength by one share." Therefore, he and his colleagues swept the ground clean, collecting more than 300 jin of grain in total, taking the grain to the riverside to wash away the mud, drying it, and then putting it back into the warehouse. He often said, "It is an honor to store the state's grain. Being able to eliminate pests, rats, mold, and rot, and not lose a single grain, is also for the sake of building a socialist society."

    两年经管三百万斤粮食没发生霉坏虫害
    黄忠拔荣获百色县“一等管仓模范”称号
    广西省百色县百色区逻素仓库年青的管仓员黄忠拔，两年多来经管过三百三十多万斤粮食。这些粮食不但没有霉坏生虫，连损耗也很少。因此，黄忠拔荣获了全县“一等管仓模范”的光荣称号。
    一九五二年一月黄忠拔到塘兴仓库做管仓员。那时正是公粮入库的时候，这个仓库只有他一个干部，仓房又很破旧。区政府原来存有一千多斤粮食在仓里，因保管不好，生了很多米象虫和飞蛾。贫农出身的黄忠拔，深知粮食的珍贵，和粮食工作与国家工业建设的关系。因此他下定决心：要克服各种困难，把粮食保管好。
    在公粮入库的前几天，他首先进行了清仓消毒工作，把虫尸、米象虫和蜘蛛网等清扫干净，刷上石灰浆。公粮入库时，他把好、次粮食分开储存。入库以后，他经常掌握粮食变化的规律，坚持三天测验一次粮温，在杨梅雨季或气候变化急剧时，就每天测温一次；七天全面大检查一次；半个月或一个月测验粮食水分一次，若发觉水分超过粮食水分度数百分之三点五时，他就马上使粮食透风，避免了发热现象。
    黄忠拔还注意了仓库的清洁卫生。他每天都打扫一次粮仓，还经常“爬仓底”，把仓底扫得干干净净，不让虫子躲藏。当他发现粮仓里有老鼠出入的时候，就爬到仓库底去，将老鼠洞用小石头堵起，然后刷上石灰浆，他还向附近农民借来几个铁猫装老鼠，从前年四月份到八月，连捕带装，共消灭了四五十只老鼠，使国家存粮减少了不少的损耗。有一天晚上，天下着大冰雹，把仓库的瓦打坏了好几处，雨水漏进仓库来，他半夜起来冒着冰雹到仓库去，一个人用二十多张竹席盖起粮食。第二天他一检查发觉有五千多斤粮食淋湿了，就马上设法翻晒，使粮食免于霉烂。
    由于他这样辛勤地保护着国家粮食，使塘兴仓库放了一年多的三十五万斤粮食，没有发热、霉变和生米象、飞蛾。后来他被调到百色区逻素仓库，他一个人要保管一百五十万斤粮食，更感到责任重大，不管白天黑夜，风里雨里，他都细心照管着国家的粮食。去年六月，他病了一个星期，还带病工作。后来入库粮比以前增加，该县粮食科派了李荣维来协助工作，他和李荣维团结得很好，共同保证了二百多万斤稻谷没有发生发热、霉变、生虫现象。十一月份，公粮和收购粮食陆续入库，他看到过秤的地方，撒了粮食，他想“少损失一粒粮食就多给国家增加一份建设力量”，因此他和他的伙伴们把地上打扫得干干净净，前后共拾起了三百多斤粮食，把这些粮食又拿到江边淘去污泥，晒干后再放进仓库。他常常这样说：“保管国家的粮食是光荣的，能除去虫害、鼠蚀、霉烂，不损耗一粒粮食，也就是为了建设社会主义社会”。
