Hebei and Shaanxi Provinces have fully launched the universal suffrage movement in conjunction with spring plowing production. The areas in the two provinces where universal suffrage is being carried out include a total of 227 counties and cities, and 11,903 grassroots units.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the universal suffrage work, both provinces have organized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to promote grassroots election work in conjunction with production. According to statistics from eight special districts including Baoding, Tianjin, and Handan in Hebei Province alone, 26,400 county and district cadres have been投入 into the production and universal suffrage movement, averaging three county and district cadres per township. In addition, at the county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings throughout the province, more than 40,000 township cadres were trained. As a result, the movement has progressed rapidly. Currently, two-thirds of the grassroots election units in the province have completed population investigation and registration and have entered the voter qualification review stage, and some townships have begun nominating representative candidates. The Shaanxi Provincial Election Committee has successively transferred 539 cadres from provincial-level agencies to various places to help carry out grassroots election work. All counties have also convened county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings and people's representatives meetings to specifically discuss and arrange spring plowing production and universal suffrage work. A large number of universal suffrage cadres have arrived at various grassroots election units. According to statistics from ten counties including Fengxiang and Longxian in the Baoji Special District, more than 3,900 cadres participated in the universal suffrage, with an average of more than five working cadres per township. Various localities in the province have also extensively organized and trained propaganda forces to widely carry out universal suffrage propaganda activities. In the Yan'an Special District, each county organized and trained an average of more than 30 Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, people's representatives, village cadres, and activists in each township, who were assigned to carry out propaganda.

In the universal suffrage work, the two provinces combined the propaganda of the general line to powerfully promote spring plowing production. In Gou Tou Township, Dingxing County, Hebei Province, the population investigation and registration and voter qualification review were completed in five days, and 3,200 mu of land were rolled and harrowed. Wu Jiawan Township in the Seventh District of Ding County, in conjunction with the universal suffrage, formulated a production plan for the entire township to dig 20 wells, open two water channels, and accumulate a circle of manure for each household. In Baoji, Zhouzhi, and Fufeng counties, Shaanxi Province, ten townships rectified more than 340 mutual aid teams and hauled more than 17,000 large carts of manure in the seven or eight days after the start of the universal suffrage work. During this period, Erqu Township in Zhouzhi County and Anban Township in Fufeng County also upgraded 16 temporary mutual aid teams to permanent mutual aid teams and newly organized 22 mutual aid teams.

    河北、陕西结合春耕全面展开普选运动
    河北、陕西两省结合春耕生产全面展开普选运动。两个省展开普选的地区共包括二百二十七个县、市，一万一千九百零三个基层单位。
    为了保证普选工作的胜利进行，两个省都组织了大批干部下乡，结合生产推动基层选举工作。河北省仅据保定、天津、邯郸等八个专区一百零六个县的统计，就有两万六千四百名县、区干部投入了生产普选运动，平均每个乡有三个县、区干部。此外，全省各县在县、区、乡三级干部会上，还训练了四万多名乡干部。因此，运动进展迅速。现在全省已有三分之二的基层选举单位完成了人口调查登记，进入选民资格审查阶段，并有部分的乡开始代表候选人提名。陕西省选举委员会先后在省级各机关抽调了五百三十九名干部，分赴各地帮助开展基层选举工作。各县还都召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议和各界人民代表会议，具体讨论和安排了春耕生产和普选工作。大批普选干部已到达各基层选举单位。据宝鸡专区凤翔、陇县等十县的统计，参加普选的干部有三千九百多人，每乡平均有工作干部五人以上。该省各地还大量组织和训练了宣传力量，广泛展开普选宣传活动。延安专区各县每乡平均组织训练了共产党员、青年团员、人民代表、乡村干部和积极分子三十多人，分工进行宣传。
    两省在普选工作中，结合总路线的宣传，有力地推动了春耕生产。河北省定兴县沟头乡五天内就完成了人口调查登记和选民资格审查工作，并轧、耙地三千二百亩。定县七区吴家湾乡结合普选订出了全乡打井二十眼、开水渠两道、每家积一圈粪的生产计划。陕西省宝鸡、盩厔，扶风三县十个乡在普选工作开始后的七、八天内就整顿了三百四十多个互助组，拉送粪土一万七千多大车。盩厔县二曲乡和扶风县案板乡并在这一期间把十六个临时互助组提高为常年互助组，还新组织了二十二个互助组。
