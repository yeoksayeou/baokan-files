    Xu Jianchun - A Good Example for Rural Educated Youth
    By our reporter Xi Ping
    I
    In the spring of 1951, the graduating class of Houlu Village Elementary School in Yexian County, Shandong Province, discussed their future aspirations with infinite hope: some hoped to continue their studies in middle school after graduation, and some hoped to go to the city with their older brothers to do business. One girl among them lowered her head and remained silent, just listening to others talk. A female classmate asked her, "Xu Jianchun, what are your plans after graduation?"
    "I want to go to school!" Xu Jianchun said. Then she added, "Maybe I'll stay in the village to work; I'm still thinking about it!"
    Xu Jianchun had indeed been constantly considering this question in those days: what to do after graduation? Before liberation, school was completely unrelated to this poor peasant family; her father and mother had never attended school. It was only after liberation that Xu Jianchun entered Houlu Village Elementary School and graduated. During these years, she had put in a great deal of effort: if there were no new books, she would look for old ones; if there were no exercise books, she would use waste paper instead. She often went to school early and late, braving wind and rain. Now that elementary school was coming to an end, she originally wanted to continue her studies. However, at the many meetings held by the village branch of the Youth League (to discuss the issue of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement), the Party Branch Secretary Xu Maoting repeatedly said: After the land reform in our village, all the poor peasants in the village received land, but some, due to a lack of labor, have land lying barren; others apply too little fertilizer, and the grain they harvest each year is not enough to eat. He hoped that the members of the Youth League would take the lead in joining mutual aid teams.
    The words of Party Branch Secretary Xu Maoting touched Xu Jianchun's heart. She thought about this day and night. She thought of Auntie Ren's family. Auntie Ren's seven mu of land could be considered top-quality land in the village, but because no one tended to it, the grain harvested each year was not much. She also thought of Li Zhengyuan's family in the east end of the village. Li Zhengyuan received a considerable amount of land in the land reform, but his wife had a child every year, and they were too busy just taking care of the children: other people's land was already planted, but his land was still bare. She also thought of her own mother and the work at home. Her mother was the daughter of a poor peasant, old and with poor eyesight, and often couldn't manage the work, lacking firewood and grain every year.
    Thinking of this, Jianchun's heart was in turmoil. During the day, she wandered in the fields carrying a basket. How familiar she was with every plot, every inch of this land! She remembered when she was very young, she had pulled a cart and gathered grass here with her grandfather, but at that time the land belonged to the landlord Xu Laowu; the year Xu Laowu was overthrown, she was still very young, and she followed the joyful crowds to the fields to watch the land being measured. While in school, she had heard the teachers say many times: agricultural production must take the socialist road, and in the future, tractors will be used, and we will live a happy life like the collective farmers of the Soviet Union. In the past, when she heard these words, she always thought it was a distant and unattainable ideal, but now her ideal had begun to be realized. She envisioned a beautiful scene in her mind: a girl sitting in the driver's seat, speeding across the vast land. …
    She finally decided to stay and participate in agricultural production work.
    II
    Xu Jianchun's action of participating in agricultural labor was praised by the villagers, and everyone elected her as the leader of the mutual aid team. For this girl, this was a new course. Not to mention anything else, just take hoeing the ground: other people's land was hoed evenly and beautifully, but the ground she hoed was uneven, and sometimes she even knocked the seedlings to the ground. Xu Jianchun thought, if the leader of the mutual aid team can't produce, how can she lead others? She resolved to learn this new course.
    Jianchun first learned to plow the land. In the autumn, it was only five o'clock, and the sun was already slanting to the west of the village. When Li Shoufu, the technician of the Jianchun Mutual Aid Team, was about to rest after plowing one row of land, Xu Jianchun came to the field and said, "Uncle Shoufu, let me try holding the plow!" She took the whip from Li Shoufu's hand, held the plow, and yelled at the livestock to move forward. The way she acted really looked like an old farmer. But the livestock was mischievous; as soon as it heard that the person yelling was a girl, it just stood there and didn't move. Jianchun thought, this fellow is really bullying; she put her strength into it and gave it a whip. This time the livestock broke into a run, and Jianchun urged it forward. But the plow became disobedient again, going to the left and then to the right, and the soil it turned over was only two or three inches deep. When they reached the end of the field, Jianchun turned around and looked at the row; it looked like a line drawn by a three-year-old child, crooked and winding. Jianchun's face was originally very rosy, but in her anxiety, and with her efforts, her face became even redder. She thought: This thing is not simple. Li Shoufu, who was resting nearby, saw her panting hard, covered in sweat, and quickly wanted to take the plow, but Jianchun didn't agree. She turned around, raised her whip, and drove the livestock back and forth three more times. This time the livestock listened, and the plow became easier to use.
    When she returned from the field, Jianchun's legs were so sore that she couldn't lift them, and her shoulders felt like she was carrying hundreds of pounds of burden. But she still went home with a light step, as usual. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she said to her mother, "Today I learned how to plow." Jianchun's mother was already sixty years old this year, and had never heard of a woman learning to plow. When she heard her daughter's words, she was both surprised and happy, and quickly scooped a ladle of hot water from the pot for her daughter to wash her hands, and couldn't help saying with joy, "You are much stronger than the older generation!"
    After dinner, Jianchun gathered the members of the mutual aid team for a meeting. She requested that two mu of land be assigned to her to be responsible for cultivation. Everyone agreed to her request, assigned her the land, and gave her the obedient and strong Big Red Mule to pull the plow. After learning to plow, she then learned to drill, hoe, water, push carts, sow seeds…
    III
    As the members of the mutual aid team said, "Jianchun's way of farming is not old-fashioned"; among the several hundred mu of land in the village, the crops that grew best, without guessing, were definitely those of Jianchun's team. In 1951, Jianchun's team harvested 150 jin more wheat per mu than the individual farmers. In 1952, they harvested more than 780 jin of corn per mu. Although they suffered a flood in 1953, the yield was no lower than the level of 1952. Someone asked Jianchun: What is the "magic" to make crops grow well? She replied: "There is no 'magic'. If there is a secret, it is that I believe in science."
    Last year, when the wheat was about to ripen, a kind of insect appeared. In a few days, it spread to all the wheat fields in the village, eating the wheat leaves and gnawing on the ears of wheat. The old men and women in the village said these were "god insects"; although the young people didn't believe in any "god insects," they were also panicked. At this time, the district instructed each village to spray DDT, but everyone was afraid to move, "afraid of offending the god insects." Jianchun was the first to adopt scientific methods of pest control. Early in the morning, before the sun rose, Jianchun led the team members to spray DDT in the wheat fields. As soon as the sun came out, the insects stiffened and died. Within three days, they extinguished the insects in more than 30 mu of land.
    This story quickly spread, and neighboring villages wanted her to provide technical guidance.
    In the spring of 1952, Jianchun read an article in a magazine that introduced the method of seed soaking. After reading it, she told the team members about the benefits of seed soaking, but no one believed it. She became anxious, but she knew that impatience would not solve the problem, so she took the lead in doing experiments to convince everyone with facts. Then, she and several people in the team who were interested in seed soaking did further experiments: they set aside half a mu of land in the team, part of which was sown with soaked seeds, and part with unsoaked seeds. When the wheat was about to ripen, the members of the mutual aid team went to the fields to visit. Few black ears were found in the first part of the land, while many black ears were found in the second part of the land. From then on, the team members believed in the benefits of seed soaking and seed selection.
    In the autumn, she read an article in the newspaper that said: If dry grass ash and animal urine are mixed together, the ammonium in the animal urine will combine with the calcium in the dry grass ash, reducing the effectiveness of fertilizing the fields. It required farmers to collect animal urine and dry grass ash separately. After reading this article, Jianchun thought of the issue of fertilizer accumulation in the team. At a mutual aid team meeting, Jianchun introduced scientific methods of fertilizer accumulation to everyone. She said: "We should not mix dry grass ash with urine in the future; the book says it is useless." As soon as Jianchun's words fell, people started arguing. The elderly suggested: If dry grass ash is not mixed with urine, it will be blown away by the wind. Some said that only when they are mixed together is the power greater. This stumped Jianchun. She thought, if I talk about "calcium" and "ammonium" to everyone, they definitely won't understand, and they won't be satisfied. She suddenly remembered that after a child urinated, the mother often sprinkled dry grass ash on it to reduce the smell of urine. She used this example to explain it, and the old women were happy and praised her for making sense.
    With Jianchun's help and promotion, the members of the mutual aid team have developed a great interest in the study of cultivation methods. Every evening, without anyone's urging, everyone automatically gathers in the mutual aid team's office to study. Shandong's "Agricultural Knowledge," "Shandong Women," and "Dazhong Daily" have become everyone's favorite reading materials. The young team members all understand the role of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Through correspondence, the mutual aid team has established contact with agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, and agricultural scientific research institutions. The cultural level of the members of the mutual aid team has also improved significantly, and many people can now write letters and read newspapers. Old Auntie Ren Hongxiang, who is nearly sixty years old, is an example: she used to be illiterate, but now she can read popular reading materials and has become the leader of the nursery group. She said to me: "New methods must be used to grow crops, and new methods must also be used to raise children; whether young or old, everyone must study, and without studying, there is no way to make a living."
    IV
    Xu Jianchun is a girl who is only eighteen years old, and she has concentrated her energy on cultivating the mutual aid team, making it gradually grow and strengthen. In January of this year, the mutual aid team began to transition to an agricultural production cooperative. Her exemplary deeds have become a role model for local young students to learn from. Last year, more than 3,000 graduating elementary school students in Penglai County proposed: "Learn from Xu Jianchun," and took up positions in agricultural production. She receives many letters every day, some from the coast of the motherland, some from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, and some from the geological exploration teams in the mountains. Each letter expresses a common wish: to learn her noble quality of consciously obeying the needs of the motherland.

    徐建春——农村知识青年的好榜样
    本报记者　习平
    一
    一九五一年春天，山东省掖县后吕村完全小学毕业班的学生们，怀着对于未来生活的无限希望，谈论着自己毕业以后的志愿：有的希望毕业后继续投考中学，有的希望跟着哥哥到城里去做买卖。其中有一个女孩子低着头一言不发，只是听着别人谈论。一个女同学问她：“徐建春，你毕业后打算怎么样？”
    “我想上学！”徐建春说。接着她又作了补充：“也许就留在村里工作，我正在寻思着呢！”
    徐建春那些天确实在不断地考虑着这个问题：毕业以后怎么办？解放以前，学校是和这个贫农家的孩子毫不相关的，她的父亲、母亲都没有进过学校。解放以后，徐建春才进了后吕村完全小学，而且读到毕业。在这几年间，她曾经付出了很大的力量：没有新书，就去找旧书；没有练习本，就用废纸来代替。她经常起早摸黑，冒着风雨上学。现在小学快毕业了，她原想继续上学。但在青年团村支部召开的多次会议上（讨论开展互助合作运动的问题），党支部书记徐茂亭一再说：俺村土地改革以后，全村贫农都分到了土地，可是，有的因缺乏劳动力，地荒着没人种；有的施肥少，每年打的粮食不够吃。他希望青年团员们带头参加互助组。
    党支部书记徐茂亭的话打动了徐建春的心。她白天黑夜想着这个问题。她想到任大婶家。任大婶家的七亩地在庄里可算头流地，但因为没人莳弄，每年打的粮食并不多。她也想起了庄东头的李正元家。李正元在土地改革中分的地不算少，可是老婆一年一个孩子，光对付孩子就忙不过来：人家地都种了，他家的地还是光溜溜的。她还想到自己的母亲，想到自己家里的活。母亲是一个贫农的女儿，年纪大，眼力不好，做活常常忙不过来，每年缺柴缺粮。
    想到这里，建春的心里乱得很。白天，她背着筐子在地里徘徊。她是多么熟悉这里的每一块、每一寸土地！她记得，当她很小的时候，曾和她的爷爷在这里拉过车，拾过草，不过那时地是属于地主徐老五的；徐老五被打倒的那年，她年纪还很小，曾跟着那些欢乐的人群到田里看丈量土地。在上学的时候，她曾经多次听见过老师说：农业生产要走社会主义的路，将来要使用拖拉机，像苏联集体农民一样过幸福的生活。过去，当她听到这些话的时候，总认为那是一个遥远的不可攀登的理想，而现在她的这个理想已经开始在实现了。她在脑子里描画了美丽的景象：一个女孩子坐在司机座里，在辽阔的大地上奔驰。……
    她终于决定留下来参加农业生产工作。
    二
    徐建春参加农业劳动的行动，受到了乡亲们的赞扬，大家推她为互助组的组长。对这个女孩子来说，这是一种新的课程。不说别的，就拿锄地来说吧，别人的地锄得又均匀又好看，她锄的地却有浅有深，有时还把苗儿砍倒在地里。徐建春想，要是互助组组长不会生产，咋去领导人家？她下定决心要学会这新的课程。
    建春最先学习犁地。秋天，时间还只有五点钟，太阳就斜到庄西面去了。建春互助组的技术员李守福耕完了一垅地正想休息的时候，徐建春到地里来了，她说：“守福叔，让我试着扶扶犁！”她从李守福的手里接过鞭子，扶着犁，吆喝着牲口向前赶。看她那付把式，真像个老庄稼。可是牲口是个调皮货，它一听吆喝的是个女孩子的口音，竟呆在地里不动弹了。建春心想，这家伙真能欺人，使上劲儿一鞭子。这一下牲口撒开腿就向前奔，建春鼓着劲往前赶。可是犁又不听使唤起来了，一下向左、一下向右，翻出来的土只有二三寸深。到了地头，建春回过来看看那条垅就像三岁孩子画的一条线似的，弯弯曲曲。建春本来的脸就很红润，心一急，再用上劲，脸就显得更红了。她心想：这玩艺可不简单，在旁边休息的李守福看她累得呼哧呼哧地喘气，满头是汗，赶紧要把犁接过来，可是建春没答应，她掉过头来，扬起鞭子，赶着牲口又来回耕了三趟。这回牲口听话了，犁也好使了。
    从地里回来的时候，建春的两条腿酸痛得提不起来，肩膀上像挑着几百斤重的担子。但是她仍然像往日一样，迈着轻快的步子赶到家。一进院子，就对妈妈说：“今天我学会耕地了。”建春妈今年已六十岁了，没听见过女人学耕地的事，一听到女儿的话，又惊又喜，赶紧从锅里舀了一瓢热水让姑娘洗手，一边止不住满心的喜悦说：“你比老一辈的人强得多！”
    晚饭以后，建春又召集互助组员们开了会，她要求分给二亩地让她负责耕种。大家同意她的请求，给她分了地，又把那匹听使唤、力气又大的大红骡给她拖犁。学会耕地以后，她接着又学会了耧地、锄地、浇水、推车、撒种……
    三
    正如互助组的组员们所说，“建春种地不老一套”；村里几百亩地里，长得最好的庄稼，不用猜，准是建春组的。一九五一年建春组的小麦每亩地比单干户多打一百五十斤，一九五二年玉米每亩打七百八十多斤。一九五三年虽然遭了水灾，但产量不低于一九五二年的水平。有人问建春：要庄稼长得好，有什么“神道”？她回答：“没有什么‘神道’，如果有秘密的话，那就是我信科学。”
    去年，麦子快要熟的时候，出现了一种虫，不几天，它就蔓延到全村的麦地，吃麦叶儿、啃麦穗。村里的老头儿和老婆婆都说这是“神虫”；年青的人虽然不信什么“神虫”，却也心慌了。这时，区里指示各村用滴滴涕喷射，可是大家都不敢动弹，“怕得罪神虫”。建春首先采用了科学的灭虫方法。早上没等太阳露面，建春就领着组员们，把滴滴涕喷射在麦地里，太阳一出，虫子就僵死了。三天之内，就扑灭了三十多亩地里的虫子。
    这故事很快地传开了，邻村都要她去作技术指导。
    一九五二年春天，建春从一本杂志上看到一篇介绍浸种法的文章，她读后把浸种的好处讲给组员听，大家都不信。她心里急起来了，但她知道，急躁是办不好事的，便带头做了试验，用事实来说服大家。接着，她同组内几个对浸种法有兴趣的人一起作进一步的试验：在组内留出半亩地，一部分播种浸过的种籽，一部分播种未经浸过的种籽。等麦子快熟的时候，互助组员们都到地里去参观，在前面一部分土地很少发见黑穗，而在后面一部分土地上却有很多的黑穗。从此以后，组员们相信了浸种、选种的好处。
    秋天，她从报纸上读到一篇文章，里面说：如果把干草灰和动物尿沤在一起，会使动物尿中的铵和干草灰中的钙化合，减低了肥田的效用。它要求农民分别积聚动物尿和干草灰。建春读了这篇文章以后，联想到组内的积肥问题。在一次互助组员会议上，建春向大家介绍了科学的积肥方法，她说：“俺们今后不要把干草灰沤到尿里，书上说这没有用。”建春的话刚一落音，人们就吵开了。老年人提出：干草灰不沤到尿里，准被风吹走。有的说只有沤在一起力量才大。这可把建春难住了。她想，要是给大伙讲“钙”“铵”，他们准不懂，也不会满意。她忽然想起孩子在撒尿以后，母亲常常用干草灰泼在上面，使尿的臭味减少。她就用这个例子来说明，老太婆听了乐开了，谁都称赞她说得有道理。
    在建春的帮助和推动下，现在互助组员们对耕作法的研究发生了很大的兴趣。每天晚上，用不着谁的催促，大家自动地集合到互助组的办公室里学习。山东出版的“农业智识”、“山东妇女”、“大众报”，已成为大家喜爱的读物。年轻的组员都懂得氮、磷、钾的作用。通过通信的关系，互助组和农业生产合作社、国营农场、农业科学研究机关建立了联系。互助组员的文化水平，也有显著提高，许多人已能写信读报。年近六十的任洪香老大娘，就是一个例子：她过去一个字也不识，现在她已能够阅读通俗读本，成为托儿组的组长。她对我说：“种庄稼要用新办法，带孩子也得用新法子；不管青年人、老年人，都得学习，不学习就没办法做营生。”
    四
    徐建春是一个年仅十八岁的姑娘，她集中自己的精力把互助组培植起来，使它逐步成长、壮大。今年一月间，互助组开始转向农业生产合作社。她的模范事迹已成为当地青年学生的学习榜样。去年蓬莱县三千多名高小毕业生提出：“向徐建春学习”，并走上了农业生产的岗位。她每天接到许多的信件，有的来自祖国的海边，有的来自朝鲜中国人民志愿军部队，有的来自山区的地质钻探队。每一封信里都表示了一个共同的愿望：学习她自觉地服从祖国需要的高贵品质。
