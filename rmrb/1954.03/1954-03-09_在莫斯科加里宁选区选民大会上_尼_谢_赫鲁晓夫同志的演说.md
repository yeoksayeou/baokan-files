Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 7th (TASS dispatch)

Comrades! The working people of the Kalinin electoral district of our glorious capital, Moscow, have trusted me greatly and nominated me as their candidate for the highest organ of state power – the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. First of all, let me express my heartfelt thanks to you for this immense honor and assure you that I will do my best not to betray your trust (applause). Every Communist who is nominated for the high state position of candidate to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recognizes that we owe the trust of the people to the Communist Party that nurtured us and its Central Committee (applause).

The Communist Party, founded by our brilliant leader and teacher, the great Lenin, is confidently leading the people along the road to communism. The Communist Party has won the unparalleled love and trust of all working people through its heroic struggle for the cause of socialism and its selfless service to the people. The glorious 50th anniversary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union vividly demonstrates the invincible power of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The people have learned from many years of personal experience that the Communist Party has no higher interests than the interests of the people, that it is a truly people's party, that the Communist Party is strong because it has an inseparable link with the people, that its ranks are united like steel, and that it is loyal to Marxism-Leninism. Today, the unity and consolidation of our Party are unprecedented! (Prolonged applause)

The people of all nationalities in our country, closely united around their own Communist Party, the Party Central Committee, and the Soviet government, are welcoming the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people wholeheartedly endorse and unanimously support the policies formulated by the Communist Party. The historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, as well as the subsequent resolutions of the Party and the government and the resolutions of the Central Committee Plenary Session that ended a few days ago, are the fighting program for our country's development at the present stage. The purpose of the Communist Party's policy is to further consolidate the strength of the Soviet motherland, to achieve new and great development of the economy and culture, to continuously improve the welfare of the working people, and to safeguard the security of the Soviet Union and consolidate the cause of world peace.

The Soviet people are working enthusiastically to implement this policy because they clearly know that the highest goal of the Communist Party, its Central Committee, and the Soviet government is the happiness of the Soviet people, the prosperity of the Soviet motherland, and the cause of communist construction. This is our supreme and fundamental goal.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, taught us that the people judge political parties and public leaders not by their declarations and promises, but by their actions. The Soviet people keep Lenin's wise instruction firmly in mind and expect their representatives to serve the people faithfully and to unswervingly implement the policies formulated by the Party. Therefore, every election to the Supreme Soviet in our country naturally becomes an opportunity for the entire people to examine the implementation of the Party's policies.

Four years have passed since the last election. In recent days, millions of Soviet men and women have been discussing the Party Central Committee's appeal to all voters at numerous election meetings, discussing our work achievements and major issues in domestic and foreign policy.

What have been the achievements in the past few years, and what are the main tasks at present?

In the 1950 elections, the Communist Party set the task of striving for the continuous development of socialist industry. Today, everyone can clearly see to what extent the industrial strength of the Soviet Union has developed in these years.

In 1953, the Soviet Union produced nearly 15 million tons more steel than four years ago, more than double the pre-war 1940 level; the output of rolled steel increased by more than 11 million tons, 2.2 times that of 1940.

In these four years, coal production increased by 36 percent, reaching 320 million tons in 1953, almost double that of 1940.

Last year, our country obtained more than 52 million tons of oil, an increase of 70 percent over 1940. In the past four years, oil production has increased by 58 percent.

Last year, the machines and equipment produced by Soviet industry were 2.2 times that of four years ago, and 3.8 times that of 1940.

In 1953, the electricity generated in the Soviet Union was 133 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 71 percent over four years ago. In the past four years, the power generating capacity of Soviet power stations has increased by 11 million kilowatts. To have a clearer idea of the important significance of the increase in the power generating capacity of our power stations, we should remember the famous GOELRO plan, which stipulated an increase of 1.75 million kilowatts in the power generating capacity of power stations. This means that in the past four years, the Soviet state has increased the power generating capacity of power stations to more than six times the generating capacity originally planned to be achieved in ten to fifteen years by the GOELRO plan (applause).

Is this not the most vivid proof of the continuous efforts of our Party and the Soviet people in realizing Lenin's great state electrification plan?

The development figures of important industrial sectors clearly illustrate what enormous achievements our people have made due to the wise policy of socialist industrialization of the country implemented under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by the great successor to Lenin's cause, J.V. Stalin.

Since our country has established a strong industry, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have been able to accelerate the development of light industry and the food industry and ensure the rapid development of agriculture, while continuing to strive for the further development of heavy industry (the cornerstone of the Soviet economy).

It must be pointed out that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have stipulated in their resolutions that the output of industrial goods and daily necessities should be greatly increased, far exceeding the targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Basic investments in these industries are being greatly increased. In 1954, the total basic investment of the Ministry of Daily Necessities Industry and the Ministry of Food Industry will exceed 14 billion rubles, an increase of 84 percent compared with 7.6 billion rubles in 1953. Our light industry and food industry have never developed at such a high speed.

In order to ensure the further development of heavy industry and light industry, it is necessary to discover and utilize the most abundant untapped potentials. Major industrial enterprises have accumulated very valuable experience in production organization, and the widespread application of these experiences will enable our industry to greatly increase output with existing equipment and production sites.

Let me give an example. The newspapers have widely publicized the high-speed brick firing method created by Comrade Duvanov, a foreman at the Voronezh Brick Factory. Applying this method, it is possible to produce 2,300 bricks per cubic meter of kiln area, while the actual brick production per cubic meter of kiln area in the past was 1,200 bricks. If all brick factories use Duvanov's method, it would be possible to almost double brick production without building new factories. However, if we were to use current technology to double brick production, we would have to spend 10 billion rubles to build new factories. This example vividly illustrates the importance of adopting advanced methods in utilizing production sites and equipment.

The industry of Moscow and the Moscow region, which occupies a significant position in the Soviet national economy, is systematically overfulfilling the production plan. However, there are also some backward enterprises in Moscow's industry, and its potential strength and reserves have not yet been fully utilized. Comrades, last year, 117 factories in the capital did not fulfill the production plan, and their production volume was 270 million rubles short of the original plan. Another major shortcoming is that some factories did not complete the plan for producing certain types of products.

Improving quality and reducing production costs are among the main tasks of industry. It must be emphasized that in many light industrial factories, not enough attention is paid to the quality of daily necessities.

We must make the greatest efforts in the near future to have good textiles, their patterns should be more exquisite, the quality of shoes should be high and the styles should be elegant, and we should fully produce exquisite items necessary to beautify the lives of Soviet people.

The Party is actively carrying out this work, and there is no doubt that this work can be victoriously completed (applause).

In the last election, the Party set the task of developing socialist agriculture. In the past period, the strength of collective farms has increased considerably, and machine tractor stations have received hundreds of thousands of tractors, combines, and other machines. The output of many collective farms and state farms has increased, and the productivity of livestock is being increased. However, we cannot be satisfied with these achievements in the slightest.

In the past six months, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has twice discussed at plenary sessions the urgent task of further developing Soviet agriculture and formulated a plan to promote the rapid development of various sectors of agriculture. This shows how much attention the Party pays to the development of agriculture. This is because the Party believes that it is necessary to bring agricultural production to a level that can fully meet the needs of the people in terms of food and the needs of light industry in terms of raw materials within the next two to three years.

In order to ensure the completion of the planned large increase in our country's grain production, collective farmers, workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, and agricultural experts must make great efforts and expend great energy, and the working class, which is currently helping the collective farm countryside, must be given this assistance on an even larger scale in the future. The task of further developing agriculture is the task of the entire people.

Special mention should be made of the task of increasing grain production and reclaiming virgin and abandoned land. The Party believes that grain production is the foundation of all agricultural production. The more grain there is, the more agricultural products the country will have—bread, meat, fat, milk, and butter. Therefore, we believe that increasing grain production is an extremely important and enormous task.

The Central Committee plenary session held a few days ago pointed out that the current level of grain production cannot meet the growing needs of the national economy. Now, the country faces the task of greatly increasing grain production so that the amount of grain purchased and acquired by the state can be greatly increased in the coming years.

In order to complete this task, the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government believe that, while increasing the yield per unit area of land in various regions, it is necessary to reclaim 13 million hectares of virgin and abandoned land—mainly in the eastern regions of our country. Comrades! This is a huge task. In the past, we did not have the strength to complete it. Now that the number of agricultural machine operators and agricultural specialists has increased, and agriculture has first-class machines, we are able to reclaim new land on such a large scale in such a short time.

This year, machine tractor stations and state farms will receive 120,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and many other machines to reclaim new land.

The development of socialist industry is indeed astonishing if it can supply agriculture with so many machines in such a short period of time! Comrades, you still remember Lenin's ideal of 100,000 tractors! Now we are supplying agriculture with more tractors in one year than Lenin's ideal! (Applause)

The Party calls on industrial workers, agricultural machine operators, Communist Youth League members, and young people to select the best and most outstanding people to work in the reclamation areas. The Communist Youth League members of Moscow have already sent the first batch of patriotic young people who voluntarily signed up to reclaim virgin and abandoned land, and such valuable initiative has also been shown in many parts of the country. Thousands of Soviet patriots have arrived in Kazakhstan and the Altai Territory and have begun working in machine tractor stations and state farms. They are doing a difficult but glorious job. As the years go by, they will proudly tell their descendants how they responded to the Party's call to reclaim virgin land, established machine tractor stations and state farms in new areas, supplied the country with much grain, and how they worked selflessly for the benefit of the motherland.

The working class, collective farmers, and Soviet intellectuals enthusiastically welcome the new and important tasks put forward by the Party in industry and agriculture. The Soviet people are fully determined to complete these tasks. Socialist competition is becoming more and more widespread, and there are more and more advanced workers.

Comrades, our urgent task is to continuously increase labor productivity. The great Lenin taught us that this is the main and most important condition for the victory of the new social system. Communism is to grow out of the creative labor of millions upon millions of people. Therefore, we must do our best to give full play to the creative initiative of the masses, strengthen labor discipline, and increase labor productivity day by day on the basis of maximizing the use of new technologies.

There are countless talented people in the Soviet land who have set many examples of highly efficient labor in industry and agriculture. How to widely apply advanced experience to every industrial enterprise and transportation industry, to collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, is a very important issue for our country.

In the last election, the Communist Party put forward the task of further improving the material and cultural standards of the working people. The Party is resolutely completing this task.

Everyone knows that in the post-war period, our country has reduced prices six times. Currently, the prices of daily necessities are 55 percent lower than in 1947. The real wages of workers and staff are constantly increasing, and the income of collective farmers is increasing. The people's consumption is increasing year by year, and the composition ratio of their consumer goods is being improved and changed. Last year, the amount of meat, butter, milk, sugar, and fruit sold to the people was two to two and a half times that of the pre-war 1940.

Soviet trade is currently being vigorously developed with the aim of further improving the service to the people.

The Party and the government pay tireless attention to housing construction. In the four years since the last election, a total of 106 million square meters of housing area has been built in cities and workers' residential areas. During this period, a total of 2,866,000 square meters of housing area has been built in Moscow. In these years, more than 1.6 million houses have been built in rural areas.

You can see that these figures are astonishing. But we cannot feel satisfied because our housing is still not enough.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government will continue to vigorously build houses, schools, hospitals, and children's institutions.

All Party organizations, Soviet organizations, trade union organizations, and youth league organizations must pay more attention to the issue of improving the service to the people. There is a tendency among some of our staff members that they regard this issue as a small issue and are unwilling to pay attention to it. However, this is not a small issue because it is related to the interests of the broad masses of the people. The huge tasks before us require us to improve our leadership methods with excellence and improve the work of all aspects of the government structure. Our cadres spend a lot of attention and effort on a large number of various resolutions and instructions. We still have many staff members who are only accustomed to sitting at the conference table and writing resolutions. But they do not like and cannot closely contact the people. They do not pay attention to the urgent needs of the working people, and they do not deeply analyze the situation. These bureaucrats do not understand the business, but they like to issue instructions on various issues, such as how to shear dog hair and how to milk chickens (uproarious laughter). We must resolutely eliminate such staff members (applause).

The Party Central Committee and the Soviet government are taking measures to improve and maximize the work of government agencies from top to bottom. Our Party and our people have sharp weapons that have been tested for a long time, such as criticism and self-criticism, to fight against various shortcomings, bureaucracy, and red tape. We must use all methods to cultivate the spirit of self-criticism, especially criticism from below, and we must strive to eliminate shortcomings and improve all our work.

During the last election, the Communist Party stipulated the task of ensuring the further development of education, science, and culture.

Today, there are more than 57 million people in our country participating in various kinds of learning. Higher education institutions and technical schools alone have more than 3 million students. In the past four years, the Soviet Union has established about 11,000 schools that can accommodate 2 million students.

Soviet scientists, writers and artists, engineers and agronomists, teachers and doctors, glorious people's intellectuals, are making valuable contributions to the construction of communist society.

Our scientists have enriched science with many important discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The Soviet state ended the US monopoly on atomic energy, which is a strong sobering agent for the imperialist aggressors (prolonged applause).

In the last election, the Communist Party called on the Soviet people to do their best to strengthen our own socialist state. Today, the Soviet multinational state has become unprecedentedly strong. The friendly family of all nationalities of the Soviet Union is united in building communist society. One of the main manifestations of the great friendship of all nationalities in our country is the 300th anniversary of the merger of Ukraine into Russia this year. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union celebrate this day as a grand national festival. The good influence of the unbreakable alliance of the working class and the peasants, the spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people, their vibrant patriotism, and the consolidated unity of the people and their own Communist Party are most powerfully manifested. Our Party is doing its best to develop Soviet socialist democracy and is still attracting millions upon millions of working people to manage the state.

When leading the people to strive for the completion of peaceful construction plans, the Communist Party and the Soviet government cannot but take into account that there are still reactionary forces in capitalist countries that are attempting to prepare for new wars to get rid of economic difficulties and resolve the increasingly acute contradictions in the imperialist camp. Therefore, the Party and the government, which adhere to a peaceful policy, tirelessly improve and strengthen the armed forces of the Soviet state, which are vigilantly guarding the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the security of our motherland (stormy applause).

The Party believes that continuing to strive to strengthen the Soviet state—a strong fortress of peace and security for all countries—is its sacred duty. Strengthening the strength of the Soviet socialist state is an important condition for building a communist society in our country (prolonged applause).

In the last Supreme Soviet elections, the Communist Party put forward the task of adhering to a peaceful foreign policy, strengthening the fraternal friendship and cooperation with the people's democratic countries, expanding business relations with all countries, resolutely crushing the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and fighting for world peace. Everyone can see that the Party is unremittingly carrying out this task.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government follow the great Lenin's instruction that there is a possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence between two different economic systems—socialism and capitalism. The Soviet government believes that in the current international situation, there are no disputes that cannot be resolved peacefully. Therefore, the Soviet Union is striving to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union is making a great contribution to consolidating world peace with its peaceful foreign policy. The recent Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference vividly demonstrated this, at which the Soviet delegation put forward specific proposals to ease international tensions. The fact that the Soviet Union has expanded trade with all countries that wish to promote trade relations with our country on the basis of mutual benefit also proves this.

The international prestige of the Soviet Union has greatly increased. The Soviet Union is at the head of the strong camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. In these years, the great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has become even more consolidated. This friendship is a major factor in the struggle for peace in the Far East and throughout the world. The fraternal cooperation between the Soviet Union and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic is expanding and consolidating. Now, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union has formed a huge force that constantly influences the entire course of international life.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government will continue to contribute all their strength to the struggle for peace and international friendship and to further develop the economic relations between the Soviet Union and all countries (applause).

The Soviet state and the people's democratic countries maintain fraternal cooperation, it is like a giant, confidently moving towards great goals, and achieving victory after victory. No force in the world can stop us from advancing towards communist victory! (Stormy applause)

The unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, the heroic Soviet people is the guarantee of our victory. The flesh-and-blood inseparable connection between the Communist Party and the broadest masses of the working people is vividly manifested in the alliance between the Communist Party and non-Party people (prolonged applause).

Strive for the victory of the alliance between the Communist Party and non-Party people in the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause)

Strive for the continuous progress of our strong Soviet motherland! (Stormy applause)

Long live the great Communist Party—the leading and guiding force of Soviet society! (Stormy applause)

Long live the glorious Soviet people, the builders and victors of the Soviet Union! (Stormy, prolonged applause. All rise.)

    在莫斯科加里宁选区选民大会上
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的演说
    同志们！我们光荣的首都莫斯科加里宁选区的劳动人民很信任我，把我提名为他们的国家最高政权机关——苏联最高苏维埃的候选人。首先，让我衷心感谢你们给我这个莫大的荣誉，并向你们保证，我一定要尽力不辜负你们的信托（掌声）。我们每一个被提名为崇高的国家岗位——苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的共产党员都认识到，由于培养我们的共产党和它的中央委员会才使我们得到了人民的信任（掌声）。
    我们的天才的领袖和导师伟大的列宁所缔造的共产党，正在满怀信心地领导着人民沿着走向共产主义的道路前进。共产党以它为社会主义事业而进行的英雄的斗争，以它为人民的忘我的服务而获得了全体劳动人民的无比热爱和信任。苏联共产党的光荣的五十周年，生动地说明了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说的战无不胜的力量。人民从许多年来的亲身经验中体会到，共产党没有比人民的利益更高的利益，它是真正的人民的党，共产党是强大的，因为它和人民有着不可分割的联系，它的队伍像钢铁一般的团结，它忠于马克思列宁主义。今天，我们的党的团结和巩固是空前的！（经久的掌声）
    我国各族人民紧密地团结在他们自己的共产党、党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围，迎接苏联最高苏维埃选举。苏联人民衷心赞成并一致拥护共产党制订的政策。苏联共产党第十九次代表大会和党中央委员会九月全体会议的具有历史意义的决议，以及党和政府后来的决议和前几天结束的中央委员会全体会议的决议，是我国在目前阶段发展的战斗纲领。共产党的政策的目的在于进一步巩固苏维埃祖国的力量，在于使经济和文化有新的巨大的发展，在于不断增进劳动人民的福利并保障苏联的安全和巩固世界和平事业。
    苏联人民正在热情地工作着，以便实行这个政策，因为他们清楚地知道，共产党、它的中央委员会和苏联政府的最高目标，就是苏联人民的幸福、苏维埃祖国的繁荣和共产主义建设事业。这就是我们的至高无上的基本的目标。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的缔造者乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁教导我们说，人民判断政党和公众领袖不是凭他们的宣言和诺言，而是凭他们的行动。苏联人民牢记着列宁的这个英明的训示，并期望他们的代表们忠诚地为人民服务，坚持不渝地执行党所制订的政策。因此，每次最高苏维埃选举在我国就十分自然地成了全体人民检查党的政策的执行情况的机会。
    从上届选举到现在已经四年了。在最近这些日子里，千百万苏维埃男女正在许多选举大会上讨论党中央委员会的告全体选民书，讨论我们的工作成绩以及对内和对外政策中的重大问题。
    过去几年中有些什么成绩，当前有些什么主要任务呢？
    共产党在一九五零年的选举中规定了为不断发展社会主义工业而努力的任务。今天，每一个人都清楚地看到，苏联的工业力量在这些年中已发展到什么程度。
    一九五三年苏联比四年前多生产了将近一千五百万吨钢，为战前一九四零年的两倍以上；钢材的产量增加了一千一百多万吨，为一九四零年的二点二倍。
    在这四年中，煤的产量增加了百分之三十六，在一九五三年达到三亿二千万吨，差不多为一九四零年的两倍。
    去年，我国获得了五千二百多万吨石油，比一九四零年增加了百分之七十。在过去四年中，石油产量增加了百分之五十八。
    去年，苏联工业出产的机器和设备为四年以前的二点二倍，为一九四零年的三点八倍。
    在一九五三年，苏联的发电量为一千三百三十亿瓩时，比四年以前增加了百分之七十一。在过去四年中，苏联电力站的发电能力增加了一千一百万瓩。为了对我国电力站发电能力的增加的重要意义有一个比较明确的概念，我们应该记得著名的全俄电气化计划，这个计划规定电力站的发电能力增加一百七十五万瓩。这意味着，在过去四年中，苏维埃国家已将电力站的发电能力提高到全俄电气化计划原订在十年到十五年达到的发电能力的六倍以上（鼓掌）。
    难道这不是我们的党和苏联人民在为实现列宁的伟大的国家电气化计划而不断努力的最生动的证明吗？
    重要工业部门的发展数字清楚地说明：由于在以列宁事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林为首的党中央委员会领导下实行的国家社会主义工业化的英明政策，我国人民取得了怎样巨大的成就。
    由于我们国家已经建立了强大的工业，共产党和苏联政府就有可能在继续努力进一步发展重工业（苏维埃经济的基石）的同时，加速地发展轻工业和食品工业并保证农业的迅速发展。
    必须指出，苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议已在它们的决议中规定：要大大超过第五个五年计划的目标，增加工业品和日用品的产量。在这些工业中的基本投资正在大大增加。一九五四年，日用品工业部和食品工业部的基本投资总额将超过一百四十亿卢布，比一九五三年的七十六亿卢布增加了百分之八十四。我们的轻工业和食品工业从来没有以这样高的速度发展过。
    为了保证进一步发展重工业和轻工业，必须发现并利用最丰富的、尚未利用的潜力。各大工业企业在生产组织方面已累积了非常宝贵的经验，广泛应用这些经验将使我们的工业能够以现有的设备和生产场地来大大增加产量。
    举一个例子来说吧。报纸曾广泛宣传沃罗湼兹制砖工厂领班杜瓦诺夫同志所创造的高速烧砖法。应用这种方法，就有可能使每立方公尺砖窑面积产砖量达到二千三百块，而过去制砖工厂每立方公尺砖窑面积的实际产砖量是一千二百块。假如所有制砖工厂都使用杜瓦诺夫的方法，就有可能把砖的产量差不多提高一倍，而不必建立新的工厂。但是，假如要用现在的技术使砖的产量提高一倍，那就不得不花一百亿卢布来建立新的工厂。这个例子生动地说明了在利用生产场地和设备方面，采用先进方法是有着多么重要的意义。
    在苏联国民经济中占显著地位的莫斯科市和莫斯科州的工业，有步骤地超额完成着生产计划。但是，莫斯科的工业中也有一些落后的企业，它的潜在的力量和后备力量还远没有得到充分的利用。同志们，去年首都有一百一十七家工厂没有完成生产计划，它们的生产量比原计划差两亿七千万卢布。还有一个很大的缺点是某些工厂没有完成生产一定种类的产品的计划。
    提高质量、降低生产成本是工业的主要任务之一。必须着重指出，在许多轻工业工厂中，对于日用品的质量注意得还不够。
    我们必须在最近的将来尽最大的力量使得我们有很好的纺织品，它们的花式应该更加讲究，鞋类的质量应该很高而且式样大方，应该充分生产美化苏维埃人的生活所必需的精致物品。
    党正积极地进行这项工作，毫无疑问，这项工作是能够胜利完成的（掌声）。
    在上届选举中，党规定了发展社会主义农业的任务。在过去的时期中，集体农庄的力量有了相当大的增加，机器拖拉机站得到了几十万部拖拉机、联合机和其他机器。许多集体农庄和国营农场的生产量增加了，并正提高牲畜的产品生产率。但是，我们仍不能丝毫满足于这些成就。
    在过去六个月内，苏联共产党中央委员会曾两次在全体会议上讨论进一步发展苏联农业这一迫切的任务，并拟订了一个促进农业各部门迅速发展的计划。这说明党对于发展农业是多么注意。这是由于党认为必须在今后两三年内使农业生产达到能够充分满足人民在粮食方面的需要和轻工业在原料方面的需要的水平。
    为保证完成已订的大量增加我国粮食产量的计划，集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员、农业专家，就必须作很大的努力，花费很大的精力，而目前正在帮助集体农庄乡村的工人阶级，将来必须在更大的规模上给予这种帮助。进一步发展农业的任务是全体人民的任务。
    特别应该提到的是增加谷物产量、开垦处女地和荒废土地的任务。党认为谷物生产是整个农业生产的基础。谷物越多，国家得到的农产品——面包、肉类、脂肪、牛奶和牛油也就越多。因此，我们认为，增加谷物产量是极其重要的巨大任务。
    前几天举行的党中央委员会全体会议指出，谷物产量的现有水平不能满足国民经济日益增长的需要。现在，国家面临着大大增加谷物产量的任务，以便在今后几年中使国家征购和收购的谷物数量得以大大的增加。
    为了完成这个任务，党中央委员会和苏维埃政府认为，在提高各个地区土地的单位面积产量的同时，必须开垦一千三百万公顷的处女地和荒废土地——主要在我国的东部地区。同志们！这是一个巨大的任务。过去，我们是没有力量来完成它的。现在，既然农业机器操使者和农业专门人材已经增加了，农业有了第一流的机器，我们就有可能在这样短的时间中，这样大规模地开垦新地。
    今年，机器拖拉机站和国营农场将得到十二万部拖拉机（每部以十五匹马力计算）和其他许多机器来开垦新地。
    如果社会主义工业能够在这样短的时间内供给农业这样多的机器，那么它的发展就确实惊人！同志们，你们还记得列宁的关于十万部拖拉机的理想吧！现在我们在一年中供给农业的拖拉机已经超过列宁的理想了！（鼓掌）
    党号召产业工人、农业机器操使者、共产主义青年团团员和青年们选出最优秀的、杰出的人到开垦地区去工作。莫斯科的共产主义青年团团员已经派出了第一批自愿报名的爱国青年去开垦处女地和荒废土地，全国许多地方也相继表现了这种可贵的积极性。数以千计的苏联爱国者已经到了哈萨克和阿尔泰边疆区，已经开始在机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作。他们是去做一件困难的、但是光荣的工作。时间会一年年地过去，将来他们将以自豪的心情告诉他们的子子孙孙说，他们是如何响应党的号召开垦了处女地，在新地区建立了机器拖拉机站和国营农场，供给国家许多谷物，以及他们如何为了祖国的利益而忘我地工作。
    工人阶级、集体农民和苏维埃知识分子，以极大的热情迎接党所提出的在工业和农业方面的新的重要的任务。苏联人民有充分的决心去完成这些任务。社会主义竞赛日益广泛了，先进工人越来越多了。
    同志们，我们的迫切任务是不断提高劳动生产率，伟大的列宁教导我们说，这是新社会制度取得胜利的主要的和最重要的条件。共产主义是要从千千万万人的创造性的劳动中成长出来的。所以，我们必须尽力发挥群众的创造积极性，加强劳动纪律，在最大限度地利用新技术的基础上一天天提高劳动生产率。
    苏维埃国土上有着许许多多有天才的人，他们在工业和农业中树立了许多效率很高的劳动的榜样。如何把先进经验广泛应用于每一个工业企业和运输业，应用于集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场，这对我们国家说来是一个十分重要的问题。
    在上届选举中，共产党提出了进一步提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平的任务。党正在坚决地完成这个任务。
    大家都知道，在战后，我国已经六次减低物价。目前，日用品价格比一九四七年低百分之五十五。职工的实际工资在不断提高，集体农民的收入在增加。人民的消费量一年比一年增多了，他们的消费品的构成比例正在改进和改变着。去年，卖给人民的肉类、牛油、牛奶、糖和水果，为战前一九四零年的二到二点五倍。
    目前正在大力发展苏维埃贸易，目的在于进一步改进为人民服务的事业。
    党和政府对于住宅建筑予以不倦的关怀。自从上届选举以来的四年中，在城市和工人住宅区共建筑了建筑面积达一亿零六百万平方公尺的住宅。在这一时期中，莫斯科共建成了建筑面积达二百八十六万六千平方公尺的住宅。在这些年中，农村共建筑了一百六十多万幢住宅。
    你们可以看到，这些数字是惊人的。但是我们并不能感到满足，因为我们的住宅还是不够的。
    共产党和苏联政府将继续大力建筑住宅、学校、医院和儿童机关。
    一切党组织、苏维埃组织、工会组织和青年团组织必须更加注意改进为人民服务的事业的问题。在我们一些工作人员中间有一种倾向，他们把这种问题当作是小问题而不愿意理睬。但是，这并不是小问题，因为它们关系到广大人民群众的利益。我们面前的巨大任务要求精益求精地改进领导方法，并改进政府机构的一切环节的工作。我们的干部把很多的注意力和力量花在大量的各种各样的决议和指示上。我们仍然有不少工作人员只惯于坐在会议桌旁和写写决议。但是他们不喜欢而且也不能够和人民密切联系。他们不注意劳动人民的迫切需要，他们不深入地分析情况。这些官僚们不通晓业务，但是他们却喜欢发布关于各种问题，诸如如何剪狗毛、如何挤鸡奶的指示（哄堂大笑）。我们必须坚决地清除这种工作人员（掌声）。
    党中央委员会和苏联政府正在采取措施来从上到下改进和尽量提高政府机构的工作。我们党和我们人民有着像批评和自我批评这样久经考验的锐利的武器，来和各种缺点、官僚主义和文牍主义进行斗争。必须用一切方法来培养自我批评、特别是自下而上的批评的精神，必须努力消灭缺点，改进我们的一切工作。
    在上届选举期间，共产党规定了保证进一步发展教育、科学和文化的任务。
    今天，我们国内有五千七百多万人参加了各种各样的学习。单是高等学校和技术学校就有三百多万学生。在过去四年中，苏联建立了约一万一千个学校，可以容纳二百万学生。
    苏联科学家、作家和艺术家、工程师和农艺师、教师和医生、光荣的人民知识分子，正在对共产主义社会的建设事业作出有价值的贡献。
    我们的科学家以各个知识领域内的许多重要发现丰富了科学。苏维埃国家结束了美国对原子能的垄断，这是对帝国主义侵略者的一剂强烈的清醒剂（经久不息的掌声）。
    在上届选举中，共产党号召苏联人民尽力加强我们自己的社会主义国家。今天，苏维埃多民族国家已经空前壮大了。苏联各族人民的友好大家庭团结一致地建设着共产主义社会。我国各族人民伟大友谊的主要表现之一，就是今年乌克兰合并于俄罗斯三百周年。苏联各族人民都把这一天当作盛大的全国性节日来庆祝。工人阶级和农民牢不可破的联盟的良好影响，苏联人民精神上和政治上的团结，他们的生气勃勃的爱国主义，人民和他们自己的共产党的巩固的团结，都最有力地表现出来了。我们的党正在尽力发展苏维埃社会主义民主，并还在吸引千千万万劳动人民来管理国家。
    共产党和苏联政府在领导人民为完成和平建设计划而努力时，不能不考虑到资本主义国家中还有反动势力存在，他们企图准备新战争以摆脱经济困难，解决帝国主义阵营的日益尖锐的矛盾。因此，坚持不渝地奉行和平政策的党和政府，不倦地提高和加强正在警惕地保卫着苏联人民的和平劳动和我们祖国安全的苏维埃国家的武装力量（暴风雨般的掌声）。
    党认为，继续努力加强苏维埃国家——和平和各国安全的强大堡垒——是它的神圣责任。加强苏维埃社会主义国家的力量是在我国建设共产主义社会的一个重要条件（经久不息的掌声）。
    在上届最高苏维埃选举中，共产党提出了坚持不渝地奉行和平外交政策，加强和人民民主国家的兄弟友谊和合作，扩大和一切国家的事务关系，坚决粉碎帝国主义侵略者的阴谋，为争取世界和平而斗争的任务。每一个人都可以看到，党正在坚持不懈地执行这个任务。
    共产党和苏联政府遵照着伟大的列宁关于两个不同的经济制度——社会主义和资本主义有长期和平共处的可能性的指示。苏联政府认为，在目前国际形势中，没有任何争端是不能以和平方式解决的。因此，苏联正尽力缓和国际紧张局势。苏联正以它的和平外交政策对巩固世界和平作出巨大的贡献。最近的柏林外长会议特别生动地证明了这一点，在这个会议上，苏联代表团提出了缓和国际紧张局势的具体建议。苏联和一切希望在互利基础上促进对我们国家的贸易关系的国家扩大了贸易，这也同样证明了这一点。
    苏联的国际威望大大地提高了。苏联走在强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的前头。在这几年中，苏联和中华人民共和国的伟大的友谊更加巩固了。这个友谊是争取远东和全世界和平的斗争的重大因素。苏联和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的兄弟合作正在扩大和巩固着。现在，以苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营形成了一股巨大的力量，这股力量经常影响国际生活的整个进程。
    共产党和苏联政府将继续贡献一切力量为争取和平和国际友谊而斗争，争取进一步发展苏联和一切国家的经济关系（掌声）。
    苏维埃国家和各人民民主国家保持兄弟般的合作，它像巨人一样，满怀信心地走向伟大的目标，一次又一次地取得了胜利。世界上没有什么力量可以阻止我们向共产主义胜利前进！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    共产党、苏联政府和英雄的苏联人民的牢不可破的团结是我们胜利的保证。共产党和最广泛的劳动人民大众之间的血肉不可分的联系，在共产党和非党人民联盟中生动地表现了出来（经久不息的掌声）。
    争取共产党和非党人民联盟在即将举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举中取得胜利！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    争取我们强大的苏维埃祖国的不断进步！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    伟大的共产党——苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    光荣的苏联人民、建设者和胜利者的苏联人民万岁！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全体起立。）（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科七日电）
