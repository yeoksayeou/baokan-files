    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 30th: Farmers in East China have begun spring planting. In Fujian Province, which is close to the subtropical zone, the seedlings of the first crop of double-cropping rice have grown to over two inches high. The province's more than three million mu of spring soybeans, early peanuts, and early sweet potatoes have all begun planting comprehensively. In the dryland areas of Shandong Province and the northern regions of the Huai River in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, most farmers have begun plowing for spring cultivation and will soon plant autumn harvest crops such as sorghum, corn, peanuts, and soybeans. In the vast rice-growing areas of Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, farmers are cultivating green manure crops such as Chinese milk vetch, and some have begun selecting seeds and applying base fertilizer in the paddy fields. In the cotton-producing areas of Shandong and Jiangsu provinces, although it is still more than a month away from the cotton planting season, farmers, in order to increase cotton production to support national industrial construction, have begun various preparations for planting cotton earlier this year and are expanding cotton fields on the principle of not affecting increased grain production. East China plans to expand cotton fields by about one million mu this year.
    This year's spring planting in East China is being carried out with greater development of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams throughout the region. Currently, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region has increased from 3,301 last year to more than 18,000. These agricultural production cooperatives, as well as millions of newly established and existing mutual aid teams, are driving the broad masses of farmers to carry out spring planting and strive to increase production of more grain, cotton, oil crops, and other industrial raw materials.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 30th: The provinces in the Southwest region successively received welcome rainfall between the 26th and 8:00 AM on the 29th, which has greatly helped to eliminate drought conditions in some areas. During these days, the average rainfall in eastern and southern Sichuan Province was over 20 millimeters, the average rainfall in northeastern Guizhou Province reached 30 millimeters, and some counties in western and northern Sichuan Province, western and southern Guizhou Province, and Xikang Province also received rainfall. Following the widespread spring rainfall from the 15th to the 21st, many areas in Yunnan Province, such as Baoshan, Tengchong, Dali, Kunming, Chuxiong, Zhaotong, and Huize, received rain again. According to observations from the Chongqing Forecasting Station of the Meteorological Office of the Southwest Administrative Committee, the rain area is currently advancing towards southwestern Guizhou Province and Yunnan Province, and it is estimated that these areas will continue to receive rain in the near future.
    Since last winter, rainfall has been scarce in some areas of the Southwest region. This rainfall will enable the spring crops (wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, etc.) that are currently flowering and heading to produce full grains and will also facilitate the timely sowing of large spring crops (rice, corn, etc.).

    华东区广大农民开始春耕播种
    西南区各省普遍下雨有利春耕生产
    【新华社上海三十日电】华东区农民开始春耕播种。在靠近亚热带的福建省，双季连作稻的第一季稻，秧苗已长到二寸多高。该省的三百多万亩春大豆、早花生、早甘薯，已全面开始播种。在山东省和安徽、江苏两省淮河以北的旱田地区，大部农民已开犁春耕，不久就要种下高粱、玉米、花生、大豆等秋收作物。浙江省和江苏、安徽两省的广大水稻地区，农民们正在培育紫云英等绿肥作物，有的已开始选种和在稻田内施基肥。在山东、江苏等省的产棉区，虽然离开植棉季节还有一个多月，农民们为了增产棉花支援国家工业建设，今年都提早进行种棉的各种准备工作，并且在不影响增产粮食的原则下扩大棉田。华东区今年计划扩大的棉田有一百万亩左右。
    今年华东区的春耕播种，是在全区农业生产合作社和互助组有更大发展的情况下展开的。目前全区的农业生产合作社已经由去年的三千三百零一个增加到一万八千多个。这些农业生产合作社以及几百万个新建的和原有的互助组，正带动着广大农民进行春耕播种，争取增产更多的粮食和棉花、油料作物等工业原料。
    【新华社重庆三十日电】西南区各省在二十六日到二十九日八时前相继获得喜雨，对消除部分地区的旱象有很大作用。这几天中，四川省东部和南部平均降雨在二十公厘以上，贵州省东北部平均降雨达三十公厘，四川省西部和北部、贵州省西部和南部以及西康省也都有若干县降雨。云南省继十五日到二十一日普降春雨后，这次保山、腾冲、大理、昆明、楚雄、昭通、会泽等许多地区又降雨。据西南行政委员会气象处重庆预报台观察，目前雨区正向贵州省西南部和云南省推进，估计最近这些地区还会继续下雨。
    西南区部分地区去冬以来雨水稀少，这次得雨，可使各地正在开花抽穗的小春作物（小麦、油菜、蚕豆等）结实饱满，同时也有利于大春作物（水稻、玉米等）及时播种。
