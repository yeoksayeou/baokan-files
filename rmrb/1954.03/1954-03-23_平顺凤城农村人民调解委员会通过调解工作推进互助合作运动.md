The People's Mediation Committees of Ping Shun County, Shanxi, and Fengcheng County, Liaodong, have begun to delve into rural mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to carry out mediation work, resolve disputes between some team members or cooperative members, and promote socialist propaganda and education through mediation work to advance the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement.

According to statistics from the People's Court of Ping Shun County, the People's Mediation Committees of 63 townships mediated a total of 577 mass disputes related to mutual aid and cooperation in 1953, of which 443 belonged to mutual aid teams and 134 belonged to agricultural production cooperatives. The Shuanghe Village People's Mediation Committee in Fengcheng County mediated 31 disputes from September to December 1953, and 42 of the 63 parties involved were members of mutual aid teams. The reasons for these disputes were mainly that a small number of farmers were accustomed to individual management and had insufficient understanding of the benefits of collective production. When they first joined mutual aid teams or cooperatives, they often had disputes due to differences in opinions between families. For example, Wang Junpu, a farmer in Shuanghe Village, Fengcheng County, was a member of a mutual aid team. His wife knew how to sew and had a sewing machine. Last year, at the end of the year, the mutual aid team planned to transform into a production cooperative, and Wang Junpu took the lead in signing up. His wife disagreed, and the two had a quarrel, with the woman proposing a divorce. After investigation and understanding by the mediation committee, it was learned that the reason why his wife was unwilling to join the cooperative was that she had a sewing machine and was afraid of being taken advantage of after joining. The mediation committee conducted socialist future education for her, and explained that having a sewing machine would not be a disadvantage after joining the cooperative. As a result, the family happily joined the cooperative. Secondly, some farmers, after participating in mutual aid and cooperation, sometimes caused disputes due to being more self-interested or because the regulations on work points and sideline dividends in the teams and cooperatives were not reasonable enough. For example, in the Geng Fuchun Mutual Aid Team in Hongni Township, Ping Shun County, six households including Geng Wanquan did not work hard when working for other families, and some team members were dissatisfied and wanted to "break up," and the mutual aid team was on the verge of collapse. The mediation committee of the township learned of this situation, conducted collectivism education within the team, explained the superiority of organizing production, and after patient persuasion, improved the ideological understanding of Geng Wanquan and other six households, and finally consolidated the mutual aid team. The entire team worked very enthusiastically in unity during the autumn harvest last year. The Guan Chengli Mutual Aid Team in Shuanghe Village, Fengcheng County, once caused dissatisfaction among some team members due to unclear work records and other issues, which were resolved reasonably after mediation.

People's mediation work can not only resolve disputes that have already occurred within mutual aid and cooperative production organizations in a timely manner, but also prevent the occurrence of disputes. For example, the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ping Shun County implemented contracting work and output. In July last year, in order to achieve high yields, each team was preparing to irrigate the land with floodwater. The mediation committee considered that if a reasonable water use method was not established, disputes would inevitably arise and affect production. Therefore, they took the initiative to study with the cooperative committee members, educated the cooperative members, and when the floodwaters rose, they worked separately with the cooperative committee members to control the water, so that more than 120 acres of land were all irrigated, ensuring increased agricultural production, which was warmly supported by the masses.

In addition, during the grain purchase work, the People's Court of Ping Shun County held a mediation work conference, organized mediation committee members to study grain policies, and explained the tasks that mediation committee members should undertake in the grain purchase work. Therefore, many mediation committee members were able to actively mobilize the masses to respond to the government's call, take the lead in selling surplus grain by setting an example, and actively mediate disputes arising in the work of purchasing grain. According to incomplete statistics from 40 townships in the county alone, 121 disputes in grain purchase were mediated, which played a certain role in the smooth completion of the grain purchase task. Xu Dongling, a woman from Shuanghe Village, Fengcheng County, had a dispute with her husband for taking the lead in selling surplus grain during the grain purchase. After patient enlightenment by the local mediation committee, her husband realized the benefits of selling grain to the state, and the couple happily sold the surplus grain to the state.

Recently, the People's Mediation Committees in Ping Shun and other places, after studying the general line of the state's transition period, have further realized that the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the only correct path to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, and have decided to take serving the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement as the focus of their work in the future. They are preparing to distribute mediation committee members to various production organizations in a planned manner, or assign special personnel to be responsible for mediating disputes in this area.

    平顺凤城农村人民调解委员会通过调解工作推进互助合作运动
    山西平顺和辽东凤城等县的人民调解委员会开始深入到农村互助组和农业生产合作社中去开展调解工作，解决部分组员或社员之间的纠纷，并通过调解工作进行社会主义的宣传教育，以推进农业互助合作运动。
    根据平顺县人民法院的统计，六十三个乡的人民调解委员会，在一九五三年共调解了有关互助合作问题的群众纠纷五百七十七件，其中属于互助组的四百四十三件，属于农业生产合作社的一百三十四件。凤城县双河村人民调解委员会，一九五三年九月至十二月共调解了三十一件纠纷，在六十三个当事人中有四十二人是互助组的组员。这些纠纷发生的原因，主要是少数农民长期习惯于个体经营的生产方式，对于集体生产的好处认识不足，在开始参加互助组、合作社时，常因家庭间的意见不一致而发生争执。如凤城县双河村农民王俊朴是互助组员，他的妻子会缝纫，并有一台缝纫机。去年年终这个互助组计划转为生产合作社，王俊朴带头报名参加，他妻子不同意，两人因此发生争吵，女方提出离婚。经调解委员调查了解，知道他妻子不愿入社的原因是自己有缝纫机，怕入社后吃亏。调解委员向她进行了社会主义前途的教育，并针对她的思想说明有缝纫机入社也不会吃亏，结果一家人便和和气气地入了社。其次，有的农民在参加互助合作以后，由于多为自己打算或由于组、社中对工价、副业分红等问题规定的不尽合理，因而有时引起争执。例如平顺县虹霓乡耿富春互助组的十九户中，有耿万全等六户在给别人家干活时不卖力，组员中有人不满意，想“散伙”，眼看互助组就要垮台。该乡调解委员知道了这种情况，在组内进行了集体主义的教育，讲解了组织起来生产的优越性，并经过耐心的劝说，提高了耿万全等六户的思想认识，终于使互助组巩固起来，全组在去年秋收中团结生产很起劲。凤城县双河村关成礼互助组曾因工账不清等问题引起了部分组员的不满，经调解后获得了合理的解决。
    人民调解工作不仅能够及时解决互助、合作生产组织内已经发生的纠纷，而且能够预防纠纷的发生。如平顺县川底村农业生产合作社实行包工包产，去年七月间，各小组为了达到丰产，都准备用洪水浇地。调解委员考虑到如不建立合理的用水办法，一定会引起纠纷，影响生产，便主动地和社务委员研究，向社员进行了教育；并在洪水涨发时与社务委员分头掌握，使一百二十余亩土地全部得到灌溉，保证了农业增产，受到群众的热烈拥护。
    此外，在购粮工作中，平顺等县人民法院曾召开调解工作会议，组织调解委员学习粮食政策，交代了调解委员在购粮工作中应担负的任务，因此很多调解委员都能积极发动群众响应政府的号召，以身作则带头出售余粮，并积极调解收购粮食工作中发生的纠纷。仅据该县四十个乡的不完全统计，就调解了收购粮食中的纠纷一百二十一件，对购粮任务的顺利完成起了一定的作用。凤城县双河村妇女徐东令，因在购粮中带头出售余粮与他丈夫发生纠纷。经当地调解委员耐心启发，使她丈夫认识到把粮食卖给国家的好处，夫妇两人高兴地把多余的粮食卖给了国家。
    最近，平顺等地的人民调解委员会由于学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，进一步认识到互助合作运动是实现农业的社会主义改造的唯一正确道路，已决定把为农业的互助合作运动服务作为今后的工作重点。他们准备有计划地把调解委员分布到各种生产组织中去，或确定专人负责调解这方面的纠纷。
