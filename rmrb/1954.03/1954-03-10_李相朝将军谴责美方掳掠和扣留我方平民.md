Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: At today's Military Armistice Commission meeting, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, General Li Xiangchao, condemned the U.S. side for abducting a large number of peaceful residents during the war and for abducting a large number of island residents when they withdrew from the coastal islands after the signing of the armistice agreement. General Li Xiangchao also condemned the U.S. side for violating Article 59 of the armistice agreement by not only failing to earnestly assist these displaced civilians to return to their hometowns, but also forcibly detaining them.

General Li Xiangchao demanded that the U.S. side abide by the armistice agreement, assist displaced civilians who are willing to return to their hometowns to return to their hometowns, and demanded that the U.S. side immediately return all the civilians abducted when they withdrew from the coastal islands after the armistice.

Among the 45 islands withdrawn by the U.S. side after the armistice, the residents of 15 islands, including Soya Island and Xi Island in Hwanghae Province, and Ryo Island and Ung Island in Hamgyongnam Province, were all abducted by the U.S. side. In addition, Cho Island in Songhwa County, Hwanghae Province, was still a relatively prosperous large island with 510 households and 3,500 people at the time of the armistice. However, the U.S. side abducted 99.7 percent of the residents during the withdrawal, and now there are only 7 households and 10 people on the island. Sunwi Island in Ongjin County, Hwanghae Province, had 427 households and 1,611 people at the time of the armistice, but after the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, only 166 households and 590 people remained. More than one-third of the population of Sinmi Island in Sonchon County, Pyonganbuk Province, was abducted by the U.S. side. The island had 303 households and 1,497 people at the time of the armistice, and the U.S. side abducted 144 households and 671 people during the withdrawal.

    李相朝将军谴责美方掳掠和扣留我方平民
    【新华社开城九日电】在今天的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军谴责美方在战争期间大量掳掠和平居民，并且在停战协定签字以后撤出沿海岛屿时，又掳走大批岛上的平民。李相朝将军并谴责美方违反停战协定第五十九款，不但没有认真协助这些失所平民返乡，反而把他们强迫扣留。
    李相朝将军要求美方遵守停战协定，协助愿意返乡的失所平民返回他们的家乡，并且要求美方立即将停战后撤出沿海岛屿时所掳走的平民全部送回。
    在停战后美方撤出的四十五个岛屿中，有黄海道的小睡鸭岛、席岛，咸镜南道的丽岛、熊岛等十五个岛屿上的居民全部被美方掳走。另外，黄海道松禾郡的椒岛，在停战时还是一个有五百一十户、三千五百人的比较繁荣的大岛，美方在撤退时竟掳走了百分之九十九点七的居民，现在岛上只有七户十个人了。黄海道瓮津郡的巡威岛，在停战时还有四百二十七户、一千六百十一人，但在美方军队撤出后，只剩下一百六十六户、五百九十人。平安北道宣川郡的身弥岛被美方掳走三分之一以上人口，该岛在停战时有三百零三户、一千四百九十七人，美方撤退时掳走了一百四十四户、六百七十一人。
