State-owned farms in Northeast China are actively preparing for spring plowing. The seed selection work for the main crops of each farm was completed by the end of February. This year, the seed selection work of each farm was more meticulous than in previous years, improving the quality of seeds. The cleaned wheat seeds at Tongbei Farm reached a cleanliness rate of 99.2%, and soybeans reached 99%. The Fifth Operation Area of the Jiusan Veterans Farm used a winnowing machine for seed selection. The germination rate of the original wheat seeds was 82%, but after selection, the germination rate increased to 90%. All farms have also learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in seed treatment and have universally promoted sun-drying of seeds. The germination rate of wheat seeds at Yong'an Farm, originally 89%, increased to 95% after outdoor sun-drying. This year, the fertilization area of each farm is larger than in previous years. In addition to the more than 10,000 tons of organic fertilizer accumulated in 1953, they are also manufacturing granular fertilizer mixed with organic matter and chemical fertilizer in large quantities. In this work, the farms have overcome many difficulties. For example, the Erlongshan and Jiusan Veterans Farms lacked machinery, so the staff used waste butter barrels, large iron buckets, large dustpans, etc. to make granular fertilizer. According to statistics, the farms have prepared more than 700 tons of superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate, which, together with organic raw materials, can be made into 1,400 tons of granular fertilizer, which can fertilize 10,000 hectares of land. The application of a large amount of granular fertilizer containing superphosphate of lime will greatly contribute to increased production in the phosphorus-deficient black soil areas (many farms belong to this soil type). At present, the farms are overhauling locomotives and farm tools. The Baoquanling Farm had 25 locomotives in need of repair, all of which were repaired before March 10. The locomotives at Tongbei Farm have been basically overhauled. It is expected that the locomotive overhaul work of each farm can be completed before March 20. The repair quality of farm tools has also been greatly improved compared to previous years.

    东北区各国营农场积极准备春耕
    东北区各国营农场正积极进行春耕生产的准备工作。各场主要作物的选种工作到二月底就已结束。今年各场的选种工作都较往年做得细致，提高了种籽质量。通北农场选后的小麦种清洁率达百分之九十九点二，大豆达百分之九十九；九三荣军农场第五作业区利用风选机选种，原发芽率百分之八十二的小麦种，经选后发芽率提高到百分之九十。各农场还都学习了苏联对种籽处理的先进经验，普遍地推行了晒种，永安农场原发芽率百分之八十九的小麦种，经过室外晒种，发芽率提高到百分之九十五。今年各农场的施肥面积都大于往年，除一九五三年积造的一万多吨有机肥料外，并在大量制造有机质和化学肥料混合的粒肥。在这项工作中，各农场克服了很多困难，如二龙山和九三荣军农场机器不足，职工们就利用废黄油桶、大铁桶、大簸箩等来制造粒肥。据统计，各农场已准备七百多吨过磷酸石灰和硫铵，加上有机质原料，可制成一千四百吨粒肥，可施一万垧地。大量含有过磷酸石灰的粒肥的施用，对缺磷的黑土地带（很多农场属于这种土质）的增产将有很大作用。目前，各农场正在检修机车和农具。宝泉岭农场有二十五台机车需要检修，三月十日前已全部修好。通北农场的机车已基本检修完。预计各农场的机车检修工作可在三月二十日以前结束。农具的检修质量也较往年有很大提高。
