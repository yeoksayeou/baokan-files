    Boatmen in Xiushui County Risk Their Lives to Rescue Grain

    In mid-January, the Sixth Grain Warehouse in Sandu, Xiushui County, Jiangxi Province, had a batch of rice to be transported to Shanxiadu. Because the river channel was narrow, the water flow was rapid, and there were many reefs, the grain-carrying boats were very prone to accidents. When these grain boats reached Yanghu Shoal in Wuning County, the boat of Zhang Xinzai, which was loaded with 34,000 catties of rice, hit a reef, and river water immediately poured into the cabin. At that time, it was raining heavily, but the boatmen of the accompanying boats, in order to rescue the state's grain, all jumped into the water to rescue it, regardless of their own safety. Under their positive actions, 20,000 catties of rice were rescued, and the grain boat was finally saved from danger. (Deng Zhonglu)

    修水县船工冒险抢救粮食
    一月中旬，江西省修水县三都第六粮食仓库有一批稻谷要运到山下渡去。因为河道浅窄，水流湍急，礁滩多，运粮的民船很容易出险。这些运粮船行至武宁县境洋湖滩时，其中装载了三万四千斤稻谷的张新崽的船只，碰上了礁滩，河水马上涌入船舱中。当时天正在下大雨，但同行船只的船民们，为了抢救国家的粮食，都奋不顾身地纷纷下水抢救。在他们这种积极的行动下，抢救出了两万斤稻谷，终于使运粮船脱了险。　（邓钟璐）
