    Fu Chungen Does a Good Job of Storage: No Grain Spoilage Accidents Occurred Throughout the Year

    Fu Chungen is a warehouse keeper at the Nanchang County Grain Depot in Jiangxi Province. He is twenty-two years old this year and a member of the Communist Youth League. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, he recognized the importance of grain storage work and therefore loves his job very much. In the beginning, he encountered many difficulties. He did not understand scientific grain storage management methods or how to use grain temperature meters and hygrometers. But he was determined to learn, asking questions whenever he didn't understand. Soon, he learned.

    Fu Chungen grew up in a poor family and personally suffered from the lack of grain, so he knows the value of grain and cherishes it very much. In order not to waste grain, he checks the quality and temperature of the grain every day. Regardless of the dampness and dirt at the bottom of the warehouse, he often crawls into the bottom of the warehouse, which is about a foot above the ground, to check it. During the rainy season, he enters the warehouse two or three times a day to check for roof leaks. After the grain enters the warehouse, he worries that the grain will heat up due to uneven dryness and humidity, so he digs ventilation ditches on the grain surface every day to ventilate, cool down, and dehumidify. He never relaxes his rat-catching work, and in the past ten months of last year, he caught a total of six hundred and nineteen rats. Due to his proactive responsibility, no spoilage accidents occurred to the grain he stored throughout the year last year.

    傅春根的保管工作做得好
    全年没有发生粮食霉坏事故
    傅春根是江西省南昌县粮食仓库的保管员，今年二十二岁，是青年团员。在党的培养教育下，他认识到粮食保管工作的重要性，所以非常热爱自己的工作。在开始时，他遇到了很多困难，科学储粮管理方法和米温计、干湿度计的使用方法，他都不懂。可是他下决心学习，不懂就问，不久，他就学会了。
    傅春根自小生在一个贫穷的家庭里，亲身受过没有粮吃的苦，知道粮食的可贵，因而非常爱护粮食。为了不损耗粮食，他天天检查粮食的质量、温度，他不管仓底潮湿、污秽，经常爬到离地一尺上下的仓底里，检查仓底。每当雨季，他一天要进两、三次仓，检查屋子漏不漏。粮食入仓后，他怕粮食会因干湿不匀而发热，就天天在粮面上扒沟通风，降温除湿。他随时随地都不放松捕鼠工作，在去年十个月中，一共捕到了六百一十九只老鼠。由于他的积极负责，在去年一年内，他所保管的粮食，没有发生过霉坏事故。
