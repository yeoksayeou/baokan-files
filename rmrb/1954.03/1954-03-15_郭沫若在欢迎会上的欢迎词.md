Comrade Kim Ung-gi, Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, and all the Comrades of the Delegation:

    The Korean People's Delegation to China, sent by the Korean Democratic United Fatherland Front, which the entire Chinese people have been deeply longing for and anticipating, has arrived in our capital – Beijing – today. The Chinese people welcome the arrival of the heroic Korean people's delegation with boundless excitement and joy. On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and the entire Chinese people, I would like to extend my sincere and warm welcome to all comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by Comrade Kim Ung-gi, and through you, I express my highest respect to the heroic Korean people. We wish the Korean People's Delegation to China great success in further consolidating and developing the traditional friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people during their visit to our country.

    The heroic Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, demonstrated astonishing fighting spirit and indestructible strength in the great struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, defeated the ferocious and brutal American aggressors, and won the great victory of the Korean armistice, not only defending the freedom and independence of their motherland, but also safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The American imperialist aggressors originally intended to use the Korean War to annex Korea and turn Korea into a springboard for new military adventures in the Far East, in order to further attack China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, defeating the American aggressors is of great and close importance to the peace and security of the Far East and the world, and especially to the immediate interests of our Chinese people. The heroic resistance of the Korean people is a great contribution to the cause of world peace, and also a great help to our people. It is precisely because of the heroic struggle of the Korean people that the security of our country and national construction have been guaranteed. We Chinese people will never forget that the Korean people have made the greatest contribution in the common struggle for our common interests, and your great achievements are respected by our Chinese people and progressive people all over the world. The shining example of the heroic struggle of the Korean people will forever inspire the determination of all oppressed nations and peace-loving people around the world to resist imperialist aggression and the confidence to win this struggle.

    The people of China and Korea share a common border of more than a thousand miles and a profound friendship of more than two thousand years. Our two great nations are flesh and blood, and share weal and woe. We jointly resisted the aggression of Japanese imperialism. In the war to defeat the American imperialist aggressors, the people of our two countries have further solidified the most precious and noble unbreakable fighting friendship in the world with our own blood. This noble internationalist friendship is the most powerful manifestation of the strong unity of the countries of our peace and democracy camp. The fighting friendship between China and Korea, the justice of the noble and supreme common cause we are engaged in, the strong unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, guarantee the great victory of the common struggle of our two peoples. This united and mutually supportive fighting friendship, strengthened by the people of our two countries in the anti-aggression war, will last forever and will continue to develop eternally.

    Comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China will personally see in various parts of China that the Chinese people are confidently engaged in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, striving to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country, gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and build our country into a great socialist country. At the same time, the Chinese people also see with great admiration and respect that the Korean people, after the war, are engaged in the arduous task of restoring and building the national economy destroyed by the war with unparalleled heroism, and have achieved great success. The development of our economic construction is the growth of the power to oppose aggression and defend peace. We hope that during this delegation's visit to our country, it will widely convey to our people the spirit of the Korean people overcoming difficulties and fighting heroically, and the great achievements in economic recovery, which will surely infinitely inspire the enthusiasm of our people to carry out socialist construction and enhance the strength of defending peace.

    While striving to build our country, the entire Chinese people are also doing their best to support the peaceful reconstruction of the Korean people, continue to adhere to and deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, and consolidate the immortal internationalist friendship between our two peoples. Our people are well aware that working together with the Korean people, with the people of all brotherly countries in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with peace-loving people all over the world, striving to achieve a peaceful solution to the Korean question, ease international tensions, and defend peace in the Far East and the world is our urgent common task at present.

    Long live the unbreakable eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the heroic Korean people and their wise leader, Marshal Kim Il-sung!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live peace!
