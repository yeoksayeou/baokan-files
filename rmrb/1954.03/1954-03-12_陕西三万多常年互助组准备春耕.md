    Over 30,000 permanent mutual aid teams in Shaanxi Province are actively preparing for spring plowing.
    The over 30,000 permanent mutual aid teams in Shaanxi Province have mostly undergone rectification during the winter, combining it with the study of the general line of the state during the transition period. Many heads of mutual aid teams have participated in training classes for mutual aid team leaders held by local prefectural and county party committees. They have a greater enthusiasm for increasing production and supporting national construction, and therefore have great production drive.
    At present, most mutual aid teams have drawn up production plans for the whole year or spring season. According to statistics from seven counties including Tongguan, Baoji, Yulin, Suide, Ankang, Wubu, and Weinan, 5,841 teams have already drawn up spring plowing production plans, and some teams are still brewing plans. In the plans of many mutual aid teams in northern Shaanxi, in addition to proposing production increase tasks, they have also specifically increased the water and soil conservation work to guarantee the completion of tasks and the development of forestry and animal husbandry. In the plans drawn up by some teams in the cotton-producing areas of Guanzhong, in accordance with national needs, in addition to ensuring that the cotton field area is not reduced, they will also strengthen learning and improve farming techniques, and strive to improve the yield per unit area. Most mutual aid teams in southern Shaanxi, based on the lack of fertilizer in paddy fields, have proposed various methods and steps for opening up fertilizer sources and collecting fertilizer in their plans.
    Mutual aid teams in various places have also purchased a lot of means of production and actively expanded reproduction. They used the income from selling surplus grain and engaging in sideline production to repair and replace some small farm tools, and also added and replaced large livestock and large farm tools. According to statistics from Xingping, Wubu, Tongguan, Ningshan and other places, local farmers, led by mutual aid teams, have added more than 1,100 new plowing cattle and 11,400 various farm tools in more than two months. In Yan'an County, 276 permanent mutual aid teams, in addition to buying more than 300 farm tools and 193 plowing cattle, also bought more than 320 sheep. In order to avoid being exploited by merchants in the purchase of means of production, mutual aid teams in some areas of Weinan, Huangling, Chang'an, Xingping, Qishan and other counties have signed or are signing combined contracts with local supply and marketing cooperatives.
    At present, except for northern Shaanxi where the ground has not thawed and the teams are actively preparing for spring plowing, some areas in southern Shaanxi with warmer weather have started spring plowing activities, actively carrying out weeding, tidying up paddy fields, and spring irrigation. The 47 mu of winter wheat and 17 mu of broad beans of the Liu Huabin mutual aid team in Ankang County have all been weeded twice. The Zhong Kegui mutual aid team in Liukou Township, Lan'gao County, has finished planting 12 mu of spring potatoes. The mutual aid teams in the Guanzhong area are also busy fertilizing wheat and cotton fields, and are actively preparing for deep plowing of cotton fields and selecting and breeding cotton seeds. In addition, many teams have recently launched spring plowing production competitions. According to statistics from Nanshe Township, First District, Fuping County, 26 mutual aid teams have challenged and responded.

    陕西三万多常年互助组准备春耕
    陕西省三万多个常年互助组正积极准备开展春耕。
    陕西省三万多个常年互助组大都在冬季结合学习国家在过渡时期的总路线进行了整顿。其中有许多互助组长都参加过当地地委和县委举办的互助组长训练班进行了学习，对于增加生产支援国家建设有了更大的热情，因此生产劲头很大。
    目前，大多数互助组都订出了全年或春季的生产计划。据潼关、宝鸡、榆林、绥德、安康、吴堡和渭南等七县的统计，订出春耕生产计划的已有五千八百四十一个组，有的组目前还正在酝酿订立。陕北地区不少互助组的计划中，除提出了增产任务外，还特别增加了保证完成任务的水土保持工作和发展林、牧业的计划。关中产棉区一些组所订立的计划中，按照国家需要，除保证不缩小棉田面积外，并且要加强学习和提高耕作技术，努力提高单位面积产量。陕南大部地区的互助组，多根据稻田缺肥的情况，在计划中分别提出了各种开辟肥源、搜肥积肥的方法和步骤。
    各地互助组还添买很多生产资料，积极扩大再生产。他们把出卖余粮和从事副业生产的收入，除修补和倒换了一些小农具外，还添买和倒换了大牲口、大农具。据兴平、吴堡、潼关、宁陕等地的统计，当地农民在互助组带头下，两个多月内已新添了耕畜一千一百多头，各种农具一万一千四百多件。延安县二百七十六个常年互助组，除买了三百多件农具、一百九十三头耕畜外，还买了三百二十多只羊子。为了避免在购买生产资料中受到商人的剥削，渭南、黄陵、长安、兴平、岐山等县部分地区的互助组，还与当地供销社订了或正在订立着结合合同。
    目前，除陕北因地未解冻各组正积极准备春耕外，在天气较暖的陕南有些地区已开始了春耕活动，积极进行着锄草、整理稻田和春灌等。安康县柳华斌互助组的四十七亩冬麦和十七亩胡豆，已全部薅了两道草。岚皋县六口乡钟克贵互助组已种完了十二亩春马铃薯。关中地区各互助组也都正在忙着给麦子和棉花地里施肥，并积极准备棉田深耕及选育棉子。另外，有不少组最近已展开春耕生产竞赛。据富平县第一区南社乡的统计，目前挑战、应战的互助组已有二十六个。
