    [This Newspaper] The news that agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an won the 1952 "National Patriotic Production Golden Star Medal" has spread throughout Shanxi Province and has promoted the current spring plowing production and mutual aid cooperation movement.

    In Song Buze Agricultural Production Cooperative, Shangwu Jing Township, Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, some members were previously unwilling to contribute the fertilizer they had accumulated to the production cooperative's land. Some would send poorer quality fertilizer to the production cooperative and keep the good fertilizer for their private plots. After studying the news published in the Shanxi Daily on February 28th about Li Shunda and others winning the Golden Star Medal, thirty households sent more than 5,800 loads of good fertilizer to the cooperative on the same day, expressing their determination to improve production in the cooperative. At the same time, the efficiency of delivering manure has also increased. Previously, twenty-eight people would deliver one hundred loads of manure in the morning, but now it has increased to more than one hundred and sixty loads. After studying this news, the members of Zhang Jincai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ganjun Village, Yicheng County, unanimously proposed to learn from labor models like Li Shunda. After discussion, everyone decided to expand the cotton planting area and harvest more cotton to support national construction, under the principle of not affecting grain production.

    After learning from the experience of Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative's contracting production, the Donghuang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejin County transformed the chaos into orderly production and achieved an overall bumper harvest of wheat. After attending the award ceremony, the cooperative's director, Chai Genlu, expressed his determination to further learn from the experience of labor models and continue to increase production. Li Zhaoyang, the director of the Qilichan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Heshun, previously had some conservative ideas and did not plan to expand the cooperative. After returning from the conference, he actively mobilized the masses to join the cooperative and wanted to learn from Li Shunda's experience in comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry.

    李顺达等荣获“爱国丰产金星奖章”的消息
    推动了山西农村春耕生产和互助合作运动
     【本报讯】农业劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安三人荣获一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”的消息在山西省各地传开后，对当前春耕生产和互助合作运动起了推动作用。
    山西平顺县上五井乡宋补则农业生产合作社，过去有些社员不愿把自己积的肥料投到生产合作社的地里，有的则把较差的肥料送到生产合作社，把好肥料上在自留地里。二月二十八日学习了山西日报上刊载的李顺达等获得金星奖章这一消息后，当天就有三十户社员把五千八百多担好肥料送到社里，并都表示决心把合作社生产搞好。同时，送粪的效率也提高了，在这以前是二十八个人一早上送粪一百担，现在已增加到一百六十多担。翼城县感军村张进财农业生产合作社学习这一消息后，社员们一致提出要向李顺达等劳动模范学习。大家讨论后，决定在不影响粮食生产的原则下，扩大棉田播种面积，多收些棉花来支援国家建设。
    河津县东黄村农业生产合作社去年学习郭玉恩农业生产合作社的包工包产经验后，使社内由混乱变成有秩序地生产，小麦获得全面丰收。社长柴根禄参加了这次给奖大会后，表示决心进一步学习劳动模范的经验，继续提高产量。和顺七里滩农业生产合作社社长李招羊过去有些保守思想，不准备扩大社，这次参加大会回去后，积极动员群众参加合作社，并要学习李顺达全面发展农林牧业的经验。
