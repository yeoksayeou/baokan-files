    Director Wang
    By Our Correspondent Gu Weijin
    In the state-owned farms of Hubei Province, people give a thumbs-up when they mention the name of Wang Libo, the director of Jinshui Farm, and say, "He's got the goods!" There's a reason people praise him like this: of the more than ninety state-owned farms in the province, Director Wang's Jinshui Farm is one of the best.

    Director Wang's ability to run Jinshui Farm well isn't because Jinshui Farm has superior conditions. On the contrary, Jinshui Farm's conditions are quite poor. However, Director Wang has clear economic accounting ideas, a good work style of doing things himself, relying on employees, and working hard, so he has gradually improved the farm.

    I
    Wang Libo is a transferred military cadre who used to be the director of the Agricultural Administration Department of the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry. On December 1, 1949, he was transferred to Jinshui Farm as director. Jinshui Farm was originally a mechanized farm before the Anti-Japanese War, but later the machinery disappeared, and it became a "rent-collecting farm" (of the farm's more than 18,000 mu of land, 17,970 mu were rented to farmers, and only thirty-odd mu were self-cultivated). When the People's Government took over in July 1949, the farm had nothing but more than 18,000 mu of land and a dilapidated building. To transform this "rent-collecting farm" into a "productive farm," according to some employees, would require at least one to two billion yuan in construction funds. However, at that time, the state could only give the farm 174,000 jin of rice (worth more than 100 million yuan) for construction, and at the same time required the farm to abolish the supply system from March 16, 1950, and become self-sufficient. From these circumstances, Director Wang saw very clearly that this farm would be difficult to manage. He thought to himself, "Should I retreat?" Suddenly he felt a burning sensation on his face, and he remembered the past: "Since joining the Communist Party in 1928, whether it was persisting in guerrilla warfare in the Dabie Mountains' Red Army guerrilla base, doing underground work for the Party on the Pinghan Line, or serving as the supply director in the division, I have never been afraid of difficulties. How can I bow my head in the face of difficulties now!" He thought for a long time and finally made up his mind: "No matter what, I must take on the burden of self-sufficiency."

    Director Wang was considering the issue of self-sufficiency when he suddenly heard a knock on the door, and Zhang Fuchun came in from outside. This was an old man in his fifties who had previously served as the director of the Kuomintang's Agricultural Improvement Institute and was now the farm's technical director. He represented the views of some employees who hoped that the farm would maintain the supply system and not implement self-sufficiency. The reason they advocated this was not only because the construction funds were too small, but also because they felt that Director Wang didn't seem like someone who could run a farm: he had been in the army for more than twenty years, and he had just come out of the mountains not long ago, was unsophisticated, didn't understand agricultural science and technology, and didn't understand farm management. How could he make the farm self-sufficient? If the farm couldn't be self-sufficient, their jobs would be at risk. He glanced at Director Wang and said:

    "I've run farms for many years in the past, and it's always been the case that the money came from above and the expenses were paid below. Even so, we still lost money every year. I've never heard of a farm being able to be self-sufficient."

    Director Wang felt that this statement was very wrong, and he retorted in a straightforward military tone: "It's no wonder that the farms you ran in the past lost money! They were bureaucratic institutions of the Kuomintang reactionaries, corrupt and wasteful, doing everything imaginable. Can we run farms the same way they did?"

      "Of course it's not the same. But we can't demand self-sufficiency right now; self-sufficiency can only be regarded as a future goal to strive for."

      "The task of the army is to fight, but sometimes it still has to be self-sufficient. The task of our farm is to specialize in producing grain. If we can't be self-sufficient and still need government supplies, what kind of talk is that? How can we demonstrate the superiority of socialist enterprises among the masses?"

    Zhang Fuchun had no words to say.

    Director Wang considered: The problem now is not only to explain the importance of self-sufficiency, but more importantly to study how to achieve self-sufficiency.

    For several nights, Director Wang had been calculating detailed accounts. He had visited local farmers to understand their production situation: on average, a farmer could cultivate ten mu of land a year, and one mu of land could produce an average of 350 jin of rice. According to this standard, a farm worker could earn an average of 3,500 jin of rice a year, which, at a price of 500 yuan per jin, would be 1.75 million yuan. He also calculated the average annual expenditure of a farm worker: wages, fertilizer and seed costs, administrative management fees, depreciation fees, public grain, etc., which would cost about 2.6 million yuan. Compared with the income of 1.75 million yuan, there was a shortfall of 850,000 yuan. That is to say, a farm worker could not be self-sufficient by cultivating ten mu of land a year.

    Director Wang was in distress. But he did not lose heart and continued to study. "The farmer's saying of cultivating ten mu of land is done under individual labor conditions; the farm is collective labor, how can it be compared?" He clarified the issue: "Collective labor can rationally use labor force and improve labor efficiency, while individual labor has limited improvements in labor efficiency. Furthermore, in addition to farming, farmers also have to go to markets, visit relatives, etc., which takes up some time. Farm farming does not have these things. Thus, it seems that farm farming should cultivate more than farmers."

    Director Wang found experienced employees to jointly study this issue.

    The employees all believed that by organizing the labor force well, they could strive to cultivate fifteen mu of land.

    Director Wang calculated: A farm worker cultivating an average of fifteen mu of land a year could earn 2.625 million yuan, which, compared with the expenditure of 2.6 million yuan, would roughly balance the income and expenditure, and they could be self-sufficient.

    Director Wang clarified the issue of self-sufficiency and mobilized employees to discuss it. Some people said, "Farming depends on the weather; if natural disasters come, no matter how well the accounts are calculated, it's useless." Some people said, "Science and technology are the most important; what can calculating accounts solve!" But the majority of people's opinion was: The method of calculating accounts is scientific. People were more confident in self-sufficiency.

    II
    In order to ensure the realization of self-sufficiency, Director Wang considered such issues: A farm worker cultivating an average of fifteen mu of land is still an experiment after all; if the experiment fails, the income cannot be guaranteed; the average expenditure of 2.6 million yuan for a farm worker is calculated according to the most stringent principles, and if you are not careful, it will be exceeded. Therefore, Director Wang proposed that it must be resolutely achieved: all employees invest in production to ensure income; practice strict economy to ensure expenditure.

    The farm first launched a frugality movement.

    Spring plowing preparations began. Employees studied the issue of fertilizer preparation. Fertilizer is the largest investment in cultivation. In order to save money, Director Wang proposed relying mainly on making fertilizer themselves and using less commercial fertilizer. But the technicians requested relying mainly on buying fertilizer. Director Wang came to calculate the detailed accounts with everyone.

      "How much does one jin of commercial fertilizer cost?" Director Wang began to ask.

      "About 400 yuan for sesame cake," the technician said.

      "In that case, 120 jin per mu would cost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and our 1,200 mu of land would cost 50 to 60 million yuan. Our construction funds are only over 100 million yuan, wouldn't that spend a large amount of expenses?"

    "But farming cannot lack commercial fertilizer," the technician still wanted to argue.

    "How many ordinary poor farmers can afford commercial fertilizer for farming? They mainly rely on making fertilizer themselves. The farm's current difficult situation is similar to that of poor farmers. If we don't learn to save like them, how can we guarantee expenses!"

    Director Wang's words convinced the other party. The purchase of commercial fertilizer was reduced from more than 40 million yuan to more than 10 million yuan. Mainly rely on making fertilizer themselves. They built toilets and collected grass clippings, ash manure, human and animal manure, garbage, etc. near the farm, of which garbage alone was more than one million jin, which not only solved the entire fertilizer problem, but also improved the soil due to the accumulation of this batch of garbage for more than twenty years.

    This fact aroused the employees' attention to frugality; however, their understanding of frugality was not deep enough. When the frugality movement was carried out in an all-round and in-depth way, everyone talked a lot. For example, Director Wang stipulated that writing letters and making summary reports should all use waste paper, and they said that he was too tight, and so on. In order to correct this wrong understanding of frugality, Director Wang educated the employees.

    "The farm has just been established, and production has not yet achieved results. Can the living standard be ahead of production?" He repeatedly said: "The idea of 'poor family assets, rich style' is unacceptable. We must be diligent and thrifty to get started."

    These words reminded everyone of Director Wang's behavior: Since coming to the farm, every morning, before the cadres got up, he always quietly put on his clothes in the dark, washed his face with cold water, and supported
  himself with a stick to the fields to direct the farm workers to prepare the fields and repair ditches, busying himself non-stop. Everyone remembered these things and felt that every word he said above was reasonable. The employees were moved and took the initiative to pay attention to frugality in places big and small.

    Simultaneous with carrying out the frugality movement, Director Wang organized all employees to invest in production. Director Wang conducted class education for farm workers, calling on farm workers to change the habit of not going to the fields in the morning. He pointed out that cadres must participate in production to lead production, and he proposed: "Cadres go to the fields."

    The busy farming season arrived, and Director Wang took the lead in going to the fields. In the past, he had farmed for others in his hometown for nine years, and he had also often helped the masses farm in the army. He was a good farmer. Now he directed farm workers with lower farming skills to plow the fields and sow seeds. He accurately allocated the number of people and livestock needed for a field to avoid idle work and waste. Sometimes he also participated in seed selection, pulling seedlings, transplanting seedlings, sowing seeds, and weeding; although his left leg was crippled, he still did his best.

    Director Wang personally went to the fields, and the employees were very moved. They said he was a
  good example of "saying and doing." Under the influence of his "good example," they changed their work attitude. Some technical cadres and administrative management cadres frowned when they first heard about going to the fields. They disliked field work and hoped to stay in the office as they had in the past farm. Now that they saw Director Wang going to the fields, they criticized "their own idea of looking down on physical labor" and took the initiative to work with the farm workers in the fields. Some technical cadres also served as production team leaders and foremen. The farm workers, seeing that Director Wang and the cadres had gone to the fields, not only changed the habit of not going to the fields in the morning, but also did many moving deeds under the leadership of the cadres in rushing to catch the farming season: In order to rush to transplant seedlings the next day, they pulled seedlings at night; in order to rush to plant cotton, they ground sesame cake in the middle of the night; to harvest wheat, they went to the fields at 3 am and rested at 12 pm.

    After the busy farming season, Director Wang organized employees to carry out necessary sideline production (such as raising pigs, milling rice, pressing oil, etc.) and basic construction, changing the habit of past "agricultural leisure."

    III
    1950 passed. Director Wang saw the results of a year of hard work: Due to the selfless work of all employees, farm workers increased the average area of cultivated land per person from the planned fifteen mu to eighteen mu; due to the implementation of intensive cultivation, the average yield of rice per mu increased from the planned 350 jin to 431 jin (16.9 percent higher than the yield of local masses), and the average yield of cotton increased from the planned 100 jin to 120 jin (20 percent higher than the yield of local masses). The yields of wheat and sesame also increased; due to strict frugality in places big and small, fertilizer, agricultural tools, administrative management fees, etc., alone saved 60 to 70 million yuan. Under the circumstances of increased production and savings, the farm not only achieved self-sufficiency, but also had a net profit of more than 111.38 million yuan.

    When the farm was first established, the employees felt that being able to achieve self-sufficiency was already very difficult, and they did not expect to have a surplus; however, everyone had to believe the iron facts.

    After 1950, Director Wang led the employees to continue to promote increased production and savings, while expanding the cultivated area (from 1,200 mu of land to more than 6,000 mu of land), promoting advanced cultivation methods, strengthening water conservancy construction, implementing cost accounting and responsibility systems, and increasing necessary sideline production. As a result, the farm was run better year by year. From 1951, a farm worker increased the average cultivated land from eighteen mu to twenty-two or three mu. The yield of crops gradually increased. The average yield of rice in 1951 was 460.7 jin, which increased to 607.1 jin in 1952, and 510 jin in 1953 (reduced production due to disasters, but still 25 percent higher than the yield of local masses). The average yield of cotton in 1951 was 121 jin, which increased to 258.1 jin in 1952, and 170 jin in 1953 (reduced production due to disasters, but still 100 percent higher than the yield of local masses). There was a surplus every year. The net profit in 1951 was 290,259,799 yuan, the net profit in 1952 was 606,023,518 yuan, and the net profit in 1953 was 800,000,000 yuan (part of the net profit was transferred from 1952, it should be that 1952 had the most net profit).

    汪场长
    本报记者　古维进
    在湖北省的地方国营农场里，人们提起金水农场场长汪立波的名字，都翘起一个大拇指说：“有板眼！”人们这样称赞他是有原因的：全省有九十多个地方国营农场，汪场长经营的金水农场，是其中最好的一个。
    汪场长能把金水农场办好，并不是因为金水农场具备了优越的条件。恰恰相反，金水农场的条件倒是很坏的。但是，汪场长有明确的经济核算思想，有亲自动手、依靠职工、刻苦经营的优良作风，因此就把农场逐渐办得好起来了。
    一
    汪立波是个部队转业干部，曾经在湖北省农林厅当过农政处长，一九四九年十二月一日调来金水农场当场长。金水农场在抗战前本是个机耕农场，以后机械没有了，变成“收租农场”（全场一万八千多亩土地，有一万七千九百七十亩出租给农民耕种，只有三十多亩是自耕的）。一九四九年七月人民政府接管时，全场除了一万八千多亩土地和一幢破旧的楼房外，什么都没有。要把这个“收租农场”变为“生产农场”，依照某些职工的意见，至少要花一二十亿元的建场经费。但是，当时国家只能给农场建场经费十七万四千斤大米（折价一亿多元），同时还要求农场从一九五零年三月十六日起，取消供给制度，实行自给自足。从这些情况里，汪场长看得很清楚，这个农场是很难经营的。他心里想道：“要不要打退堂鼓？”忽然他觉得脸上热辣辣的，想起了过去：“自己从一九二八年参加共产党以来，不管在大别山的红军游击根据地坚持游击战争，不管在平汉线做党的地下工作，不管在师里当供给处长，从来没有怕过困难，现在怎么能在困难面前低头呢！”他想了好些时候，到底打定了主意：“不管怎样，要挑起自给自足的担子。”
    汪场长正在考虑自给自足的问题，忽然听得一阵敲门声，张富春从外面进来了。这是个五十多岁的老头，过去当过国民党的农业改进所所长，现在是农场的技术负责人。他代表部分职工的意见，希望农场保持供给制度，不要实行自给自足。他们所以这样主张，不仅因为建场的经费太少，而且感到汪场长不像个办农场的人：他在军队里呆了二十多年，现在刚从山沟出来不久，土里土气，不懂农业科学技术，不懂农场的经营管理，这怎么能把农场办到自给自足呢？农场不能自给自足，他们的饭碗就保不住。他瞅了瞅汪场长说：
    “我过去办了多年农场，都是上面拿钱，下面开支。就是这样，每年还要赔钱。从来没有听说办农场可以自给自足的。”
    汪场长觉得这种说法很不对头，他以军人直率的语气反驳道：“过去办农场赔钱，活该！他们是国民党反动派的官僚机构，贪污浪费，无所不为。我们办农场，还能和他们一样？”
      “当然不一样。可是，我们不可能现在就要求做到自给自足；自给自足只能当作将来的奋斗目标。”
      “军队的任务是打仗的，可是有时还要做到自给自足。我们农场的任务是专门生产粮食的，如果不能做到自给自足，还需要政府供给，这算什么话，还能以社会主义企业的优越性在群众中起示范作用吗？”
    张富春没有话说了。
    汪场长考虑：现在的问题不仅要说明自给自足的重要，更重要的要研究怎样才能做到自给自足。
    有几个晚上，汪场长一直在算细账。他曾经访问当地农民的生产情况：一个农民一年平均可以种十亩田，一亩田平均产稻谷三百五十斤。根据这个标准，农场一个农工一年平均可以收入稻谷三千五百斤，每斤折价五百元，收入一百七十五万元。他又计算农场一个农工一年的平均开支：工资、肥料种籽费、行政管理费、折旧费、交公粮等，约需二百六十万元。这和一百七十五万元的收入相比，不敷八十五万元。就是说，一个农工一年平均种十亩田不能自给自足。
    汪场长在苦恼中。但是他并不灰心，继续研究。“农民说的种十亩田，是在个体劳动的情况下进行的，农场是集体劳动，怎么能相比呢。”他把问题想开：“集体劳动可以合理使用劳动力，提高劳动效率，个体劳动提高劳动效率是有限的。再说，农民除了种田，还要赶集、走亲戚等，这里要花费一些时间，农场种田就没有这些事情。这样看来，农场种田应该比农民种得多。”
    汪场长找到有经验的职工共同研究这个问题。
    职工都认为：把劳动力很好组织起来，可以争取种到十五亩田。
    汪场长计算：一个农工一年平均种十五亩田，可以收入二百六十二万五千元，这和二百六十万元的开支相比，大致收支平衡，可以自给自足。
    汪场长把自给自足的问题研究清楚，发动职工进行讨论。有的人说：“种田靠天，天灾来了，账算得再好没有用。”有的人说：“科学技术最重要，算账能解决什么问题！”但是大多数人的意见是：算账的办法是科学的。人们对自给自足比较有把握了。
    二
    为了保证自给自足的实现，汪场长考虑这样的问题：一个农工平均种十五亩田，毕竟还是试验；如果试验不成，收入就不能保证；一个农工平均二百六十万元的开支，是根据最紧缩的原则计算的，稍不注意，就会超出。为此，汪场长提出必须坚决做到：全体职工投入生产，保证收入；厉行节约，保证开支的口号。
    农场首先开展了节约运动。
    春耕准备工作开始了。职工们研究肥料的准备问题。肥料是耕作上最大的投资。为了节约，汪场长提出主要依靠自己造肥，少用商品肥料。但是技术员要求以买肥料为主。汪场长就来和大家算细账。
      “一斤商品肥料多少钱？”汪场长开始发问。
      “麻饼四百元左右。”技术员说。
      “这么说，一亩田上一百二十斤就要花四、五万元，我们的一千二百亩田就要花五、六千万元。我们的建场经费才一亿多元，不是要花掉很大一笔的开支吗？”
    “但是，种田不能缺少商品肥料。”技术员还想争辩。
    “一般的贫苦农民种田能有多少买得起商品肥料？他们主要是依靠自己造肥。农场今天的困难情况和贫苦的农民差不多，如果不学习他们那样节省，怎样保证开支！”
    汪场长的话说服了对方。购买商品肥料由四千多万元减为一千多万元。主要依靠自己造肥。他们修起厕所，把农场附近的草渣、灰粪、人畜粪、垃圾等搜集起来，其中仅垃圾就有一百多万斤，不仅解决了全部的肥料问题，而且由于这批垃圾堆积了二十多年，还具有改良土壤的效能。
    这一事实，引起职工对节约的重视；但是，他们对节约的认识还不够深刻，当节约运动全面深入地开展时，大家议论纷纷。例如，汪场长规定写信、作总结报告一律利用废纸，他们就说他扣得太紧，等等。为了纠正这种对节约的错误的认识，汪场长就对职工进行教育。
    “农场才开办，生产还没有搞出成绩，生活标准还能走在生产的前头吗？”他反复地说：“‘穷家当，富派头’的思想是要不得的，必须勤俭刻苦，才能起家。”
    这一阵话，使大家想起了汪场长的为人：他自到农场以来，每天早晨，干部还没有起床，他总是悄悄地摸黑穿上衣服，用冰冷的水洗洗脸，就扶着
  一根棍子到田间指挥农工整田、修渠，忙个不停。大家想起这些，觉得他上面说的每一句话都有道理。职工们受到感动了，都主动地在大大小小地方开始讲究节约了。
    和开展节约运动的同时，汪场长组织全体职工投入生产。汪场长给农工进行阶级教育，号召农工要改变过去早晨不下田的习惯。他指出干部必须参加生产才能领导生产，他提出：“干部到田间去”。
    农忙季节到来，汪场长首先下田。过去他在家乡给人种过九年田，在部队里也经常帮助群众种田，他是个种田的好手。现在他指挥种田技术较低的农工犁田、播种，他准确地分配一丘田所需的人、畜工数，免得窝工浪费。有时他也参加选种、扯秧、插秧、播种、薅草；虽然他的左腿已经残废，还尽着自己的力量去干。
    汪场长亲自下田，职工非常感动。他们说他是
  “连说带干”的好样。他们在他的“好样”的影响下改变了工作态度。有些技术干部和行政管理干部开始听到下田都皱起眉头。他们厌恶田间的劳作，希望像在过去的农场那样呆在办公室里。现在他们看见汪场长下田，都批判了“自己的轻视体力劳动”的思想，主动到田间与农工一块劳作，有些技术干部还担任生产队长和领班等。农工看见汪场长和干部都下了田，不仅改变了早晨不下田的习惯，在干部领导抢火色当中，还做出许多动人的事迹：为了第二天抢插秧苗，他们夜间扯秧；为了赶种棉花，他们半夜碾好麻饼；抢收小麦，他们早晨三时下田，晚间十二时才休息。
    农忙过去，汪场长组织职工进行必要的副业生产（如喂猪、碾米、榨油等）和基本建设，改变过去“农闲”的习惯。
    三
    一九五零年过去了。汪场长看见一年来刻苦经营的成果：由于全体职工忘我地劳作，农工由原计划平均每人种田十五亩增到十八亩；由于实行精耕细作，稻谷由原计划每亩产三百五十斤增到四百三十一斤（比当地群众的产量高百分之十六点九），棉花由原计划产一百斤增到一百二十斤（比当地群众的产量高百分之二十），小麦、芝麻的产量也有所增加；由于大小地方都厉行节约，仅肥料、农具、行政管理费等就节省了六、七千万元。在增产和节约的情况下，农场不仅达到自给自足，而且还有纯益一亿一千三百八十多万元。
    初建场时候，职工感到能够做到自给自足已经很不容易，没有想到会有盈余；然而铁的事实大家不得不相信了。
    一九五零年以后，汪场长领导职工继续推行增产节约，同时扩大耕地面积（由一千二百亩田扩大到六千多亩田），推广先进耕作方法，加强水利建设，实行成本核算制和责任制，增加必要的副业生产。于是农场办得一年比一年好。从一九五一年起，一个农工由平均种田十八亩增到二十二、三亩。作物的产量逐渐提高。一九五一年稻谷的平均产量四六○点七斤，一九五二年增加到六○七点一斤，一九五三年为五一○斤（因灾害减产，但仍比当地群众的产量高百分之二十五）。一九五一年棉花的平均产量一二一斤，一九五二年增加到二五八点一斤，一九五三年为一七○斤（因灾害减产，但仍比当地群众的产量高百分之百）。每年都有了盈余。一九五一年纯益二九○、二五九、七九九元，一九五二年纯益六○六、○二三、五一八元，一九五三年纯益八○○、○○○、○○○元（其中有一部分纯益是一九五二年转账过去的，应该是一九五二年纯益最多）。
