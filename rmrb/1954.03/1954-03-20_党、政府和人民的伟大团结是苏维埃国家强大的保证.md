The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded and nurtured by the great Lenin and his immortal cause’s successor, the great Stalin, is strong because it maintains close ties with the masses and enjoys the boundless love and trust of the people. The entire history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's fifty years of heroic struggle clearly demonstrates that it is a truly people's party, connected to the working class and all working people by flesh and blood.

In the Soviet Union, the Party and the people share common interests and aspirations, unified goals and tasks. This unity is based on the great Communist Party's tireless struggle for the freedom and happiness of the working people, and for the further improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of all Soviet people—workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. In the cause of consistently consolidating its ties with the masses, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always followed the extremely important Marxist-Leninist principle that the people are the decisive force in history and the true creators of history.

The people create all material wealth through their labor, without which society can neither exist nor develop. From this, it is clear that the masses of the people are the decisive creative force of society, and the history of society is the history of the direct producers of material wealth, the history of the working masses.

Unwavering faith in the people and in their creativity is one of the characteristics of the Communist Party, distinguishing it from all bourgeois parties in Russia in the past, and also from the bourgeois parties in capitalist countries today. In the past, there were many bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties in Russia that attempted to pose as representatives of the people's interests, but in reality, they despised the people and sold out their interests to please the exploiters.

After witnessing the anti-people policies of these parties during the revolutionary struggle, the working masses resolutely followed the Communist Party, which bravely defended their vital interests.

The greatest achievement of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lies in the tremendous work it carried out among the masses, leading the masses in revolutionary struggle, and organizing the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, which constitutes the majority of society. It was precisely by relying on this alliance that the Party won the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and guaranteed the construction of a socialist society in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet regime, which arose from the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and has been increasingly consolidated, is the closest and dearest regime to the people. It ensures that millions of working people in the Soviet state actively participate in the management of state affairs.

The Soviet regime has won the complete trust and love of the masses of the people because it guarantees all citizens the rights that workers in capitalist countries do not enjoy and cannot enjoy. These rights have been confirmed by the fundamental law of the Soviet state—the Soviet Constitution.

The Soviet regime grants all citizens the right to work, the right to rest, the right to material security in old age and sickness, and the right to education. The Soviet state effectively guarantees the realization of these rights.

These great achievements of the Soviet people demonstrate to the world the superiority of the Soviet socialist system over the capitalist system.

The Soviet socialist state is the decisive instrument for the Communist Party and the Soviet people in their struggle to build a communist society in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Party is constantly consolidating the great socialist state. The more consolidated and powerful the Soviet state becomes, the more smoothly the Soviet people will advance towards the great goal of communism.

The most obvious manifestation of the indestructible link between the Party, the government, and the Soviet people is the election of state power organs.

After overthrowing the regime of landlords and capitalists, the October Socialist Revolution established the dictatorship of the working class. The working people became the sole masters of the country. They were absorbed to participate regularly in the management of the socialist state and played a decisive role in it. The members of the Soviet power organs are clear proof of the true popular nature of the Soviet state. Of the 1,316 deputies to the Supreme Soviet elected on March 12, 1950, 418 were workers, 269 were peasants, and 629 were public officials and intellectuals. Among the deputies to the Supreme Soviet, there were 280 women—representatives of the millions of heroic working women of Soviet society. Representatives of all nationalities within the Soviet Union widely participated in the work of the highest organ of state power.

As soon as we glance at the members of the bourgeois parliament, we can understand that the situation there is completely different. There, we cannot find a single worker or a single peasant. For example, the US Congress is completely occupied by figures such as big business owners, big merchants, land management owners, senior military officers, and professional politicians.

It is thus clear what the millions of working masses in bourgeois countries can get from the reactionary bourgeois parliament—the loyal slave of monopoly capital.

In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party forms a close alliance with non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals to jointly participate in elections.

The entire people elect candidates nominated by the Party and the non-Party alliance to work in the Soviets, and the entire people vote in favor of the Communist Party's policies. In the March 1950 elections for deputies to the Supreme Soviet, 111,109,010 people (99.98 percent of all voters) participated in the voting.

Soviet citizens express their boundless trust in the Party and the Soviet government by actively participating in elections.

Now, as the election of the Supreme Soviet is taking place, the great unity of the Party, the government, and the people is even more powerfully manifested.

As in past election campaigns, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, together with trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other workers' organizations, participated in the election of the Supreme Soviet on March 14, 1954. Candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet, as in previous elections, were jointly nominated by the Party and non-Party alliance, which embodies the great and unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and all the Soviet people.

The Soviet working people fully support the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government because these policies have always conformed to their fundamental interests and aspirations, both in the past and now.

The Party's policies of socialist industrialization of the country, agricultural collectivization, and building socialism in the Soviet Union fully conform to the vital interests of the Soviet people.

It is precisely by relying on the great superiority of the Soviet social system and state system that the Soviet people have been able to continuously realize the directives of the Communist Party, establish a powerful modern industry, and lay a solid foundation for the socialist economy.

The collective farm system has been increasingly developed and has become a powerful force. Thanks to this system, socialist agriculture has been continuously developed and consolidated.

Advanced Soviet science and culture have also achieved remarkable successes. The Soviet people have carried out a genuine cultural revolution throughout the country.

Now, based on the achievements already made in heavy industry, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are implementing a huge program to rapidly improve agriculture and produce necessities for the people. The resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the subsequent resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union reflect the Party and government's policy of further vigorously improving the living standards of the working class, collective farmers, and all the Soviet people.

The Soviet people are sparing no effort in their struggle to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government. They deeply know that the successful implementation of these resolutions will promote the further consolidation of the alliance of the working class and the collective farmers, strengthen the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, and thus inevitably strengthen the power of the socialist country.

The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union's communique on the results of the implementation of the state plan for the development of the Soviet national economy in 1953 pointed out that the Soviet Union achieved new and significant achievements in developing the economy and improving the welfare of the working people in 1953.

The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1953 increased by 12 percent compared with 1952, and by 45 percent compared with 1950.

The Soviet people have also achieved significant achievements in agriculture. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms damaged during the war have been fully restored. The sown area and the harvest of major crops have not only reached but also exceeded pre-war levels.

In the months since the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the material and technical foundations of socialist agriculture have been further strengthened and consolidated. In 1953, agriculture received 139,000 general-purpose tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 18,000 cultivating tractors, 41,000 grain combines, 69,000 trucks, more than 2 million pieces of various agricultural machinery, and a large amount of mineral fertilizers.

In order to strengthen the cadres of the machine tractor stations, the Party dispatched more than 100,000 agronomists and livestock specialists, and a large number of technicians and engineers who are good at organizing the correct use of first-class machinery to the countryside to serve the collective farms.

On the basis of the comprehensive development of our economy, the income of the working people is constantly increasing. The state retail prices of industrial products and food have been steadily declining year by year.

The state budget is increasing preferential treatment and appropriations for residents, such as social insurance and social security allowances, subsidies, allowances for mothers with many children and single mothers, and free medical care.

With the increase in the monetary wages and actual wages of workers and staff, the income of farmers has also greatly increased. In 1953, the income of collective farms and collective farmers increased by more than 13 billion rubles solely due to the implementation of economic incentives for collective farms and collective farmers and some measures taken in tax policy. Commodity circulation is also expanding year by year. In 1953, trade achieved commodities worth 33 billion rubles more than stipulated in the annual plan, and the store network and other Soviet trade enterprises of various types also greatly expanded.

The Party is concerned about the growth of the spiritual wealth of the Soviet people and ensures the further development of national education, science, literature, and art. Seven-year universal compulsory education is implemented in the Soviet Union. Today, more than 57 million people are participating in various studies. More than 3 million people are studying in universities and specialized schools alone. The Party attaches great importance to advanced Soviet science that faithfully serves the interests of the people. Soviet scholars have enriched science with many extremely great discoveries in all fields of knowledge.

The foreign policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet government fully conforms to the earnest wishes of the Soviet people and their interests: they yearn for peaceful coexistence with all the peoples of the world. This policy also fully conforms to the interests and expectations of peace-loving people all over the world. The Soviet working people have consistently implemented the great peace-loving principles of foreign policy declared by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and his successor and student, the great Stalin, and are moving forward holding high the lofty banner of peace and the great unity of the people of the world.

These achievements of the Soviet Union—the huge and undeniable achievements of the Soviet system and the socialist economic system—are the result of the great organizational work of the Party and the government and the heroic labor of the Soviet people. Nevertheless, in its letter to voters on February 11, 1954, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union once again called not to be satisfied with the achievements already made. The letter to voters stated: "The Communist Party will continue to work tirelessly to further improve the lives of the people, and the Party will resolutely and unswervingly implement the plan formulated by the Party to improve the material welfare of the working people. The Party considers this its sacred duty."

The Soviet socialist system contains huge and truly inexhaustible potential, sufficient to further vigorously develop our country's economy and culture, and to continuously improve the welfare of the people.

The revolutionary determination and initiative of the masses are the inexhaustible source of the strength of the Soviet state. The creativity and initiative of the Soviet people are particularly evident in socialist competition. In the Soviet state, socialist competition has become a nationwide movement to increase labor productivity, complete and overfulfill national economic plans, and increase social wealth. Socialist competition is the main method of building communism by relying on the maximum initiative of the working masses.

The increasingly consolidation of the Party's ties with the broad masses of the working people, the correctness of the Party's policies, and the huge organizational work carried out by the Party in implementing these policies are also the source of the continuous strengthening of the power of the Soviet Union in the post-war period.

In his summary report on the work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress, Comrade Malenkov said: "The strength of our Party lies in its flesh-and-blood ties with the broad masses, in the fact that it is a truly people's party, and its policies conform to the vital interests of the people."

The Soviet people trust the beloved Communist Party, and they are increasingly closely united under the Party's invincible banner. Under the leadership of the genius Lenin and his successor and student, the great Stalin, and their comrades-in-arms, the battle-hardened Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the leading and guiding force of Soviet society.

The unity of the Party, the government, and the people in the Soviet state is the guarantee of the strength of the socialist country and the guarantee of new and outstanding achievements in the struggle for communism.

    党、政府和人民的伟大团结是苏维埃国家强大的保证
    苏联哲学硕士  普·亚历山大洛夫
    由伟大的列宁及其不朽事业继承者伟大斯大林所创建和培育起来的苏联共产党是强大的，因为它同群众有着密切的联系，它得到了人民的无限爱戴和信任。苏联共产党五十年来英勇斗争的全部历史明显地证明：它是真正人民的党，它与工人阶级和全体劳动者血肉相连。
    在苏联，党和人民有着共同的利益和愿望，一致的目标和任务。伟大的共产党为劳动者的自由与幸福，为进一步提高全体苏维埃人民——工人、集体农民、知识分子的物质福利和文化水平所做的不懈斗争便是这种一致的基础。苏联共产党在始终不渝地巩固着自己同群众的联系的事业中，一贯遵循着马克思列宁主义关于人民这个极重要的原理：人民是历史的决定性力量，是历史的真正缔造者。
    人民用自己的劳动创造全部物质财富，没有这些财富，则社会既不能存在，也不可能发展。由此可见，人民群众是社会的决定性创造力量，社会的历史就是物质财富的直接生产者的历史，是劳动群众的历史。
    坚定不移地相信人民，相信人民的创造力是共产党的特点之一，它使共产党有别于以往俄国的一切资产阶级政党，也有别于现今资本主义国家中的资产阶级政党。在俄国过去有过不少各式各样的资产阶级和小资产阶级政党，他们企图冒充人民利益的代表者，然而实际上他们鄙视人民，为了取悦于剥削者而出卖人民的利益。
    劳动群众亲眼看见了在革命斗争过程中这些政党的反人民政策之后，便决然跟着勇敢保卫着自己切身利益的共产党前进。
    苏联共产党最伟大的功绩在于，它在群众中进行了巨大的工作，领导了群众进行革命斗争，并且组织了构成社会上大多数人的工人阶级和农民的联盟。党正是依靠着这个联盟才赢得了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，确立了无产阶级专政并保证了在苏联建成社会主义社会。
    由于伟大十月社会主义革命胜利而产生和日益巩固起来的苏维埃政权，是人民最亲近的和亲爱的政权。它确保了使苏维埃国家千百万劳动者积极参加管理国家的事业。
    苏维埃政权之所以能得到人民群众的完全信任和爱戴，乃是因为它保证使国内全体公民得到了资本主义国家劳动者没有享受到，也不能享受到的那些权利。而这些权利业已为苏维埃国家的根本法——苏联宪法所确认了。
    苏维埃政权赋与全体公民以劳动权、休息权、年老和疾病时享受物质保证权、受教育权。苏维埃国家切实保证着这些权利的实现。
    苏维埃人民所获得的这些伟大成就，向全世界表明了苏维埃社会主义制度之优越于资本主义制度。
    苏维埃社会主义国家，是共产党和苏维埃人民为在苏联建成共产主义社会而斗争的决定性的工具。因之党始终不断地巩固着伟大的社会主义国家。苏维埃国家愈益巩固强大，则苏维埃人民也必会愈益顺利地向共产主义的伟大目标前进。
    党、政府和苏维埃人民不可摧毁的联系的极明显的表现便是国家政权机关的选举。
    十月社会主义革命在推翻地主、资本家政权之后，便建立了工人阶级专政。劳动者成为国家的唯一主人。他们被吸收来经常参加对社会主义国家的管理，并在其中起着决定性的作用。苏联政权机关的成员，便是苏维埃国家真正富于人民性的明证。一九五○年三月十二日选出的一千三百一十六名最高苏维埃代表，其中四百一十八名是工人，二百六十九名是农民，六百二十九名是公职人员和知识分子。苏联最高苏维埃代表中，有二百八十名妇女——苏维埃社会千百万英勇的劳动妇女大军的代表。苏联境内各民族都有代表广泛地参加国家政权最高机关的各项工作。
    只要我们看一眼资产阶级国会的成员，便可以了解到那里完全是另外一种情况。在那里我们找不到一个工人，也找不到一个农民。譬如美国国会便是完全为大企业主、大商人、土地经营主、高级军官、职业政客等之流的人物所盘踞着。
    由此显然可见，资产阶级国家千百万劳动群众会从反动的资产阶级议会——垄断资本的忠实奴仆——得到什么。
    在苏联，共产党与非党工人、农民和知识分子结成紧密联盟来共同参加选举。
    全民把党与非党联盟所提出的候选人选进苏维埃中工作，全民投票拥护共产党的政策。一九五○年三月选举最高苏维埃代表时，有一亿一千一百零九万零十人（占全体选民百分之九十九点九八）参加了投票。
    苏联公民以积极参加选举来表现自己对党和苏维埃政府的无限信任。
    现在，当最高苏维埃进行选举的时候，党、政府和人民的伟大的团结一致，更加有力地显现了出来。
    如同过去的选举运动一样，苏联共产党同职工会、青年团以及其它劳动者组织一道，来参加一九五四年三月十四日最高苏维埃的选举。最高苏维埃代表候选人，也如过去历次选举一样，是由体现着共产党、苏维埃政府和全体苏联人民伟大的牢不可破的团结一致的党和非党联盟联合提出的。
    苏联劳动者之所以全力支持共产党和苏维埃政府的政策，乃是因为这些政策无论过去和现在始终符合于他们的根本利益和渴望。
    党所制定的国家社会主义工业化，农业集体化政策以及在苏联建成社会主义的政策，完全符合于苏联人民的切身利益。
    苏联人民正是依靠了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的巨大优越性，才得以不断实现共产党的指示，建立了强大的现代化工业，为社会主义经济打下坚实的基础。
    集体农庄制度已日益发展起来，并且成了一支强大的力量，赖有这种制度，社会主义农业得以不断发展和巩固。
    先进的苏维埃科学和文化也获得了卓越的成就。苏联人民在全国内进行了真正的文化改革。
    现在，共产党和苏维埃政府根据重工业业已获得的成就，正在实行迅速提高农业和生产人民必需品的巨大纲领。苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会的决议以及苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会后来的各项决议，都反映出了党和政府关于进一步大力提高工人阶级、集体农民、全苏人民生活水平的政策。
    苏联人民正不遗余力地为实现党和政府的决议而斗争。他们深知，这些决议的顺利实现，将促进工人阶级和集体农民的联盟更加巩固，使苏维埃社会精神上和政治上的一致进一步加强，从而必将使社会主义国家的威力更加强大。
    苏联部长会议中央统计局关于一九五三年苏联国民经济发展国家计划执行结果的公报指出，苏联于一九五三年在发展经济与提高劳动者福利方面获得了新的重大成就。
    苏联一九五三年工业总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十二，比一九五○年增加了百分之四十五。
    苏维埃人民在农业方面也获得了显著的成就。战时遭到破坏的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场业已全部恢复了。播种面积和主要农作物收获量不仅达到而且超过了战前水平。
    苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会后几个月以来，社会主义农业的物质技术基础更加增强并巩固起来了。一九五三年农业得到了十三万九千台一般用拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），一万八千台中耕用拖拉机，四万一千台谷物联合收割机，六万九千辆载重汽车，两百多万件各式农业机器以及大量矿质肥料。
    党为了加强机器拖拉机站的干部，派遣了十万多名农艺师和饲畜师，大批善于组织正确使用头等机器的技师和工程师到农村中去为集体农庄服务。
    在我国经济全面发展的基础上，劳动者的收入在不断增加。工业品和食品的国家零售价格逐年节节下降。
    国家预算中给居民的优惠和拨款，如社会保险和社会赡养津贴、补助、子女众多的母亲和单身母亲津贴、免费医疗等都在增加。
    随着工人和职员货币工资和实际工资的增加，农民的收入也大大增加了。仅是由于对集体农庄和集体农民实行经济上的奖励以及在税收政策方面所采取的一些措施，一九五三年集体农庄和集体农民的收入就增加了一百三十多亿卢布。商品流转也逐年在扩大。一九五三年在贸易方面获得了价值比年度计划规定多三百三十亿卢布的商品，商店网和其它各种苏维埃贸易企业也大大扩大了。
    党关怀着苏维埃人民精神财富的增长，保证国民教育、科学、文学和艺术的进一步发展。在苏联实行七年制普及义务教育。现今参加各种学习的有五千七百万人以上。仅在高等学校和专科学校中就学的就有三百万人以上。党极其重视忠实地服务于人民利益的先进的苏维埃科学。苏维埃学者们以自己在一切知识领域内的许多极其巨大的发现丰富了科学。
    共产党和苏维埃政府的对外政策完全符合于苏联人民的殷切愿望和他们的利益：他们渴望与世界上各族人民和平共处。这种政策也完全符合于全世界爱好和平人类的利益和期望。苏联劳动者一贯实现着由共产党和苏维埃政府缔造者乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁所宣布的对外政策的伟大的爱好和平的原则，并高擎着和平与世界人民大团结的崇高旗帜前进。
    苏联所获得的这些成就——苏维埃制度和社会主义经济体系的巨大的、无可置疑的成就，是党和政府伟大的组织工作和苏维埃人民英勇劳动的成果。尽管如此，苏联共产党在一九五四年二月十一日告选民书中还是一再号召不要满足于既得的成绩。告选民书中说道：“共产党将继续不倦地为进一步改善人民的生活而努力，党将坚决地、坚持不懈地执行党所制订的提高劳动人民物质福利的计划。党认为这是自己的神圣责任。”
    在苏维埃社会主义制度内蕴藏着巨大的、真正无穷无尽的潜力，足以用来进一步大力发展我国的经济与文化，用来不断提高人民的福利。
    群众的革命毅力和主动创造精神，是苏维埃国家强大的不竭之源。苏维埃人民的创造性和积极性在社会主义竞赛中表现得特别明显。在苏维埃国家中，社会主义竞赛已成为为提高劳动生产率，完成和超额完成国民经济计划，增加社会财富而斗争的全民运动了。社会主义竞赛，这是依靠劳动群众的最大积极性来建设共产主义的主要方法。
    党同广大劳动群众的联系的日益巩固，党的政策的正确以及党在实现这些政策时所进行的巨大的组织工作，也是战后时期苏联威力得以不断加强的渊源。
    马林科夫同志在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告中谈道：“我们党的力量在于它与广大群众之间的血肉联系，在于它是一个真正人民的党，它的政策符合于人民的切身利益。”
    苏联人民信任亲爱的共产党，他们日益紧密地团结在党的战无不胜的旗帜之下。在天才的列宁与其事业的继承者和学生伟大的斯大林以及他们的战友们的领导之下，百炼成钢的苏联共产党是苏维埃社会的领导力量和指导力量。
    苏维埃国家党、政府和人民的团结，便是社会主义国家强大的保证，是为共产主义斗争获得新的卓越成就的保证。
