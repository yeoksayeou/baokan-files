    Overcoming the Chaotic Phenomenon in Street Work
    Letter from Xuchang Municipal People's Government: The criticism of the chaotic phenomenon in our city's street work published in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on November 26, 1953, is completely correct, and we sincerely accept it. After the completion of the general election work at the end of 1953, the leading comrades of our city personally presided over a government affairs meeting and specifically examined the decentralism in various departments and the chaotic phenomenon in street work. Since last spring, our city has corrected the "five excesses" phenomenon in our work. However, because the leadership was busy with central tasks and did not strictly control the issuance of documents, coupled with the fact that the decentralism in various departments was not completely overcome, with each department emphasizing the importance of its own work, and some even directly assigning tasks to the streets, the chaotic phenomenon in street work has gradually developed again. In order to effectively overcome the decentralism in various departments and the chaotic phenomenon in street work, we have formulated the following measures:
      1. All departments must strengthen the planning of their work and adhere to the weekly office meeting system. No department shall assign work to the streets without the approval of the office meeting. In case of urgent tasks, they must be approved by the administrative head before they can be assigned downwards.
    2. The secretariat must strictly control the issuance of documents. When several departments assign work to the streets at the same time, street cadre meetings should be organized according to the nature of the work and carried out in a unified manner.
    3. Strengthen the education of cadres on the overall concept and organizational concept, so that all work should be subordinate to and revolve around the central task, and overcome decentralism and the phenomenon of each acting on its own. Cadres sent by various departments to work in the streets must obey the unified leadership and work plans of the street administration committee.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    克服街道工作中的忙乱现象
    许昌市人民政府来信：一九五三年十一月二十六日“读者来信摘要”栏发表的对我市街道工作中忙乱现象的批评是完全正确的，我们诚恳接受。在
  一九五三年底普选工作结束后，我市领导同志亲自主持召开政务会议，专门检查了各部门工作中的分散主义和街道工作中的忙乱现象。自去春我市纠正了工作中的“五多”现象以后，由于领导上忙于中心工作，对文件签发控制不严，再加上各部门工作中分散主义现象没有得到彻底克服，都强调本部门工作重要，甚至有的直接向街道布置工作，因此，街道工作中的忙乱现象又逐渐发展起来。为了有效地克服各部门工作中的分散主义和街道工作中的忙乱现象，我们订出以下几项办法：
      一、各部门必须加强工作中的计划性，坚持每周办公例会制度。凡未经办公会议通过的工作计划，任何部门不得向街道布置。如有紧急任务，须经行政首长批准后，才能向下布置。
    二、秘书室对签发文件，必须严加控制。几个部门同时向街道布置工作时，应按工作性质组织街道干部会议，统一进行。
    三、对干部加强整体观念和组织观念的教育，一切工作应服从中心工作，并围绕中心工作来进行，克服分散主义和各自为政的现象。各部门派到街道上工作的干部，必须服从街政委员会的统一领导和工作计划。
