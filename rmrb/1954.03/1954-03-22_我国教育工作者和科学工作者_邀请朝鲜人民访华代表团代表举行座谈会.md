Whether in ancient books or in real life, the labor and wisdom of our two peoples have always been intertwined.

Today, we are truly filled with unspeakable joy and are willing to talk freely with our beloved friends about everything.

Amid warm applause, the representatives of the delegation presented a banner to the Chinese scientific community.

Representative Cui Minghe spoke at the meeting. He said: All the people of our republic, regardless of men, women, old or young, know that during the cruel war period in our country, Chinese scientists went directly to the Korean front lines to investigate and expose the enemy's barbaric use of bacteriological weapons, and made great contributions in restoring destroyed highways, bridges, and railways, and in the post-war reconstruction. In particular, the 1,802 precious books of 202 kinds donated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the Korean Academy of Sciences have been very helpful to our Korean scientists. On behalf of the Korean people, I express my deep gratitude to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
