Saving the Train Amidst the Wind and Rain at Midnight
    Yang Xiuqian

    One night last August, a violent storm raged. Public Security warrior Wu Fei was patrolling the second tunnel on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway line, carrying his gun. As he walked, he thought about what had happened a few days earlier: about four thousand kilograms of stones had collapsed from the cliff at the east entrance of the first tunnel, blocking the railway. When he returned to his post to call warrior Zheng Shizhou to relieve him, he repeatedly instructed Zheng Shizhou to be extra careful.

    Zheng Shizhou had just walked into the west tunnel when he heard a loud crash outside. He felt his way out of the tunnel and found several piles of large stones on the tracks, and the floodwaters had already reached the railway. He quickly ran back to the squad and reported the situation at the west entrance to the squad leader.

    The news awakened all the warriors in the squad, and they hurriedly got up and rushed to the scene of the accident with the squad leader. The squad leader shone his flashlight and saw that the floodwaters had submerged the railway, and stones from the cliff were still tumbling down with a rushing sound. It was past ten o'clock, and the "134" passenger train from Taiyuan to Beijing had already left Lujiazhuang. In thirty or forty minutes, the train would pass through here. In this critical situation, the squad leader said in a serious tone: "Comrades, we must fight the flood! Everyone quickly starts to drain the water and move the stones, and we have half an hour to complete it." He paused for a moment and said to warriors Wang Yushan and Li Xinfa: "You two quickly go to the east station to contact them, and ask them to send some workers to help with the repairs. Go quickly and return quickly!" After the warriors left, he thought again: This express train has already left Lujiazhuang and does not stop at small stations. If Wang Yushan and Li Xinfa can't make contact, it will be a major problem if the train comes. He decided to go to a squad three or four miles west to call and tell the station to stop the train; if he encountered the train along the way, he could also give a stop signal. But the raging flood blocked the road to the west. What to do? Time was passing by every second. Could he bow his head in the face of difficulties? No, definitely not! The squad leader thought for a moment and then handed over the task of moving stones here to the deputy squad leader Zhao Hebao. He himself picked up the signal light and walked into the knee-deep flood.

    The strong wind and rain made it impossible to open one's eyes. While moving the stones, the warriors kept looking at the signal light held by the squad leader. Suddenly, they saw the light seemed to be floating on the water, and the squad leader's dark shadow was gone. Everyone ran to the edge of the raging flood. Just as warrior Zheng Shizhou and others were about to jump down to save the squad leader, the dark shadow reappeared above the water. The warriors shouted: "Squad—Leader! Come—Back!" The wind scattered their shouts, and they couldn't hear the squad leader's reply. But the dark shadow and the signal light in the flood were gradually moving closer to them.

    After the squad leader stepped onto the roadbed, he was surrounded by the warriors. They saw that the squad leader's hands and feet were cut and bleeding by the sharp stones. When they heard the squad leader say that he would rest for a while and then go again, they all asked him: "Squad leader, send me, you're tired!" "Squad leader, you need to command the whole squad, let me go in your place!" Squad leader Wu thought: Who should I send? Some warriors are on guard, some are draining water, and it is obvious that there are no extra people available. At this moment, he remembered the instructor's words: "You must be able to withstand the test!" An infinite force was encouraging him: He could not bow his head to the flood, and he could not retreat in the face of difficulties! He made up his mind and waved his hand firmly and said:
    "Comrades, obey orders, you are needed here. I must go over there, if the train comes... that would be a loss to the people of the motherland."

    The warriors knew that the squad leader's will was firm, but the current was too rapid, how could people get across? So they came up with a way: two people held the squad leader's hands in front and behind and sent him to the west bridgehead.

    The squad leader went ashore on the west side and went straight to the third tunnel. When he contacted the station, the station said that the "134" passenger train had already left. He hurried out.

    The train's whistle sounded, and the "clunk clunk" vibration became closer and closer. He immediately stood more than a hundred meters away from the train, ready to give a stop signal immediately. But he suddenly remembered: If the train brakes immediately while traveling at high speed, it will damage the locomotive. So he first waved the yellow light in the wind and rain, and when the train's speed slowed down, he then gave a red signal. The train stopped safely. He ran closer to the locomotive and explained the accident ahead and the ongoing repairs to the driver and conductor. The driver heard the squad leader's voice trembling with cold, reached out and pulled the squad leader into the locomotive to warm up, and said gratefully: "Comrade, you saved the lives and property of the entire train!" The squad leader said in a firm tone: "We are warriors of the railway public security force, this is our responsibility."

    Soon, warrior Zheng Shizhou ran over, covered in mud and waving his hands in the wind and rain, shouting: "Squad leader, we have drained the water and moved the stones, and it's passable!"

    When the warriors saw the train slowly moving forward, and the last wheel rolled through the tunnel, the warriors breathed a sigh of relief.

    The long whistle sounded like a victory call, reverberating in the wind and rain-swept mountains.

    夜半风雨中救列车
    杨秀谦
    去年八月某天晚上，狂风暴雨大作。公安战士吴飞背着枪在石太铁路线上的第二隧道巡逻。他一边走，一边想着前几天发生的事情：第一隧道东口约有四千公斤的石头，从悬崖上塌下来，堵塞了铁路。他在回到班里喊战士郑士洲去换哨时，再三嘱咐郑士洲，要他多多留神。
    郑士洲刚走到西洞里，就听到洞外轰的一声。他摸出洞外，在铁轨上发现几堆大石头，洪水已浸到铁路上来了。他很快地跑回班里，把西洞口发生的情况报告了班长。
    这消息惊醒了全班的战士，大家急忙爬起，随着班长奔向发生事故的地点。班长用手电筒一照，见洪水已把铁路淹没，悬崖上的石块，还在哗啦哗啦地往下滚。这时已过了十点钟，由太原开往北京的“一三四”次客车，已开出了芦家庄，三四十分钟后，火车就要经过这里。在这刻不容缓的情况下，班长用严肃的语气说：“同志们，我们要和洪水战斗！大家快动手排水搬石头，限半个小时完成。”他停了一会，向战士王玉山、李新发说：“你们快到东边车站去联系，要他们派些工人来抢修，速去速回！”战士们离开以后，他又想：这次快车已开出芦家庄，小站不停，假若王玉山、李新发联系不上，火车开来就误了大事。他决定到西边三四里外的一个班去打电话，告诉车站要火车停下来；要是中途遇到火车，自己也可发出停车信号。但汹猛的洪水阻挡着往西边去的道路。怎么办呢？时间在一秒一分地过去，能在困难面前低头吗？不，决不能！班长考虑了一下，就把这里搬石头的任务交给副班长赵和保，自己提着信号灯往没膝的洪水中走去了。
    大风大雨，吹打得人睁不开眼睛。战士们在抢搬石头中，不时向班长提着的那盏信号灯望一望。突然，他们看见那盏灯像在水面飘，而班长的黑影子不见了。大家跑到洪水汹涌的路边，战士郑士洲等正要扑下去救班长时，黑影又伸出了水面。战士们呼喊起来：“班——长！回——来！”风吹散了他们的喊声，听不到班长的回答。但洪水里的黑影和信号灯，却渐渐地向他们移近。
    班长踏上路基后，被战士们包围起来。他们看到班长的手和脚，都被尖石划得皮破血流。当他们听到班长说歇一下还要去时，都向他要求：“班长，派我去吧，你累了！”“班长，你要指挥全班，让我代替你去吧！”吴班长想：派谁去呢？有的战士在站岗，有的在排水，人手显然是腾不出的。这时他想起指导员的话：“要经得起考验！”一股无穷的力量在鼓舞着他：不能向洪水低头，不能在困难面前退缩！他打定了主意，就挥着手坚决地说：
  “同志们，服从命令，这里需要你们。我一定要过去，要是火车开过来……那就是祖国人民的损失。”
    战士们知道，班长的意志是坚决的，但水流湍急，人怎得过去呢？便想出了一个办法：两个人前后拉着班长的手，把他送到了西边桥头。
    班长上了西岸，直奔第三隧道。当他与车站联系时，站上说“一三四”次客车已开过来了。他急忙走了出来。
    火车的汽笛声传来了，“吭隆吭隆”的震动声越来越近。他马上站在距火车百多公尺远处，准备马上发出停车信号。但他忽然想起：火车在急行中，如果立刻刹车，会损坏机车。于是他先用黄灯在风雨中摇晃，等火车的行车速度慢了下来，就接着发出红色信号。火车安然地停下来了。他跑近机车，向司机和车长说明前面发生的事故和正在抢修的情况。司机听到班长冷得发颤的声音，伸出手一把将班长拉上机车去烤火，并感激地说：“同志，你们救了全车的生命财产啊！”班长用坚实的口吻说：“我们是铁道公安部队战士，这是我们的责任。”
    不久，战士郑士洲飞跑过来，混身像个泥人一样在风雨中挥舞着手喊：“班长，我们把水排净，把石头搬光了，可通车啦！”
    当战士们看到列车徐徐地向前行进，最后一个轮子滚过隧道时，战士们轻松地舒了一口气。
    汽笛的长鸣像是胜利的号角，在风雨狂扫的山野里振荡着。
