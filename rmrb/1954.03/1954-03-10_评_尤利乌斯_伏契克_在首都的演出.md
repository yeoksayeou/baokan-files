    Playwright: Yu. Polyakovsky Director: Zhao Yue, Tian Lan Assistant Director: Xiao Qi
    Performed by the China Youth Art Theater
    Among the various forms of cultural exchange between fraternal countries, staging plays about each other's lives, work, and struggles is one of the most effective. Like mutually dispatched song and dance troupes, exhibitions, or translated films, plays can reach a majority of the audience. And a faithful, vivid performance will have an even more profound impact. The China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Julius Fucik" (adapted by Soviet playwright Yu. Polyakovsky from Fucik's posthumous work "Report from the Gallows" and other materials) not only allowed the Chinese people to gain a more concrete, direct, and comprehensive understanding of the lives, struggles, ideals, strong personalities, and excellent qualities of the Czechoslovak people, increasing their deeper affection for them, but also, through the authentic image of Fucik embodied on the stage, and his staunch and unyielding revolutionary fighting spirit against fascism for the freedom of his country and people, profoundly educated the audience, becoming an immortal example inspiring the Chinese people to bravely struggle for the realization of the most beautiful ideals of mankind. Transforming such a historically significant script into a stage image, presenting it vividly, steadily, and simply to the audience, is a glorious and arduous task.
    The China Youth Art Theater seriously and solemnly treated the performance of "Julius Fucik." Before the performance, the directors, actors, and stage staff collected and studied various materials related to Julius Fucik, striving for authenticity. With the enthusiastic help of Czechoslovak friends, the entire performance was serious, simple, steady, and faithful to the historical truth of the time, without exaggeration or affectation, without unnecessary decoration. Most of the actors performed very realistically, especially the demeanor of the revolutionaries, their adherence to their beliefs, their self-sacrifice, and their spirit of optimism, which were all well expressed. Here, we can see the simple style of the directors and actors jointly exploring and pursuing the path of realism.
    Julius Fucik was a high-ranking leader of the Communist Party, a keen, composed, tenacious, and mature revolutionary who always insisted on and wholeheartedly served the Czechoslovak people's anti-Nazi struggle with all possible means. He was also a passionate, vibrant, and creatively rich writer and poet. Comrade Wu Xue's creation of the image of Fucik is lovable, respectable, and believable. He basically expressed Fucik's character. For example, in the second scene, when Fucik, after working all night, praises the dawn and spring with deep affection; when Lida rebukes him for not sleeping all night, he lies down on the bed with innocence and seriousness, showing an open and simple heart; when he hears that the German invaders have attacked the Soviet Union, he immediately drafts a call for the Czechoslovak people to carry out underground struggle, showing his passionate emotions; Fucik's composure and determination when he is suddenly arrested by Nazi secret agents at a secret meeting place to plan the "May Day" action; Fucik's contemptuous and sarcastic gaze at the enemy in the "Room 400" detention cell; his solemn expression when he celebrates his "May Day" in prison with excitement and hope, and leads everyone to sing the Internationale; and in the scene before Fucik is sent to Berlin for sentencing, when he bids farewell to the old teacher Besek in prison, all these scenes prominently and appropriately express Fucik's confidence, wit, optimism, thoughtful judgment, and firm and steady demeanor.
    However, in addition to the qualities that a revolutionary should possess, such as courage, wit, and Party spirit, Fucik also has some distinct personality traits: love of life, brightness, optimism, sharpness, humor, and a vigorous life force. When shaping this heroic figure, the actor must grasp his entire spiritual world in order to create a concrete person of flesh and blood, Fucik, who possesses a high degree of Party spirit and heroic spirit. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire artistic creation, Comrade Wu Xue still focuses more on expressing Fucik's qualities as a revolutionary, while the aspects belonging to Fucik's personality traits are not expressed enough. The actor has not yet delved into the depths of Fucik's character, and has not expressed strongly enough Fucik's passionate love for the people, for his comrades, for his wife, and his deep hatred for the enemy; and he also lacks actions commensurate with this passionate emotion. His love for his wife and comrades seems not passionate enough, not unrestrained enough; especially later, when the enemy's oppression becomes more and more cruel, the relationship between comrades will become closer and more passionate, but Comrade Wu Xue's performance of inner emotions becomes less and less full. Fucik's reading of his own manuscript "Seven steps from the door to the window, seven steps from the window to the door" in prison, like many other dialogues of Fucik in the play, are excerpts from famous sentences in "Report from the Gallows." Only by further exploring the profound meaning of these words and expressing them with corresponding emotions and tones can the actor infect the audience and arouse their resonance, and Fucik's image can be more full. In these aspects, the actor has not yet satisfied the audience's requirements.
    Comrade Shi Yu's portrayal of Böhm, the special commissioner and head of the secret service sent by Hitler's Germany to Prague, is also a difficult role to play. He possesses the arrogance of a racial supremacist, and after occupying Czechoslovakia, he has an even greater sense of superiority as a conqueror and ruler. Böhm's utter brutality fully demonstrates the insidiousness, viciousness, and cruelty of Nazi secret agents. He hates the Communist Party and hates the people. But his cunning, ruthlessness, and cruelty inevitably lead to failure; his embarrassment, emptiness, and despair drive him to madness. All of this is hidden beneath a hypocritical facade. This is not an ordinary German bandit, but Fucik's opponent in struggle. Comrade Shi Yu, who plays Böhm, does not superficially vilify the character as is common in portraying "villains," but strives to delve into the character's inner world and express his personality traits. For example, in the first scene, when Böhm is talking to Friedrich, he says: "The common people? What common people? A bunch of beasts!" Comrade Shi Yu does not utter a blatant curse here, but says this sentence with extreme contempt; he waves his right hand, does not look at people, and spells out two words "beasts!" softly and forcefully between his teeth. This contains great insidiousness and ruthlessness. In the sixth scene, Böhm has a long conversation with Mrs. Maria. Suddenly, his tone becomes low and gentle, which makes the trickery in his heart at that time even more terrifying. Then, Maria goes into the inner room, and we see Böhm's arrogant smugness as he thinks he has won: he paces back and forth, takes out a cigarette case, smokes, and then hands it to Karl, saying to Karl: "You must understand the people you rule." But the result is beyond his expectation, Maria is not deceived, but shows the revolutionary's fearless qualities. At this time, he shows disappointment and embarrassment, and says with gritted teeth: "Old hag! This will make you suffer enough!" Suddenly showing a ferocious face, he yells madly: "Take her away!" The actor here peels away Böhm's disguise layer by layer, showing his ugly essence.
    However, Comrade Shi Yu's expression of Böhm's different attacks on Fucik, his reactions each time he is strongly rebuffed by Fucik, especially the turning points each time, are not clear and lack depth, so the hierarchical development of this character is not distinct enough. In the first three scenes, Böhm's national arrogance under the domination of racial supremacism is not enough; in the later scenes, as the enemy-ourselves struggle gradually deepens and fascism faces the fate of destruction, Comrade Shi Yu's portrayal of Böhm is not deep enough in reflecting their more cunning and slippery nature and the gradual emptiness and embarrassment in their hearts during the struggle, therefore, it cannot make the audience deeply appreciate the comprehensive brutality and extreme odiousness of the Nazi bandits.
    Other actors, such as Comrade Jiang Shui who plays the old teacher Josef Bešek, Comrade Lan Ying who plays Maria Jerinkova, Comrade Lu Xi who plays Gusta Fucikova, and Comrade Jin Shuzhi who plays Anna Klementis, have also created realistic and vivid images.
    Julius Fucik and Böhm are the two main lines that run through the entire script, the two main generals of conflict and struggle. Behind them, on the one hand, is the people's team, they are heroic and unyielding, except for individual (such as Milek) wavering defections, more people are awakened and participate in the struggle, thereby strengthening this team; on the other hand, is the fascist camp, they are vicious, insidious, and cunning, but although they use various despicable means, they still cannot shake the fighting will of the people's heroes, so they finally fail. Although Julius Fucik died, the heroic, unyielding, and fearless optimism of this hero triumphed. This symbolizes the people and the final victory. This script precisely expresses the spirit of Fucik. The performance of the China Youth Art Theater has many advantages and is generally successful, but the entire performance is not full enough in expressing this spirit, so the power to move people is not strong enough. For example, like a long wind sending a boat, the wind is blowing, the sails are unfurled, and the boat is moving, but there is no momentum of riding the wind and waves; like a wildfire burning a mountain, the fire is burning, raging and unextinguished, and spreading, but we still do not feel the power of a prairie fire, and we feel that the majestic momentum we hope to feel is still insufficient.
    What is the reason? I think that in addition to the shortcomings in the expression of the characters' personalities, the expression of the struggle environment at the time is not difficult enough. The entire play's historical background is in the period of fascist rule, and Fucik and his comrades are engaged in underground struggle in a very unfavorable environment. This needs to be emphasized, but the emphasis is not enough now. For example, in the first scene, Fucik and Gusta's meeting is a secret meeting in the park. They are husband and wife, so this meeting should be exciting and enthusiastic; but they are also two revolutionaries, because they are both shouldering the task of underground struggle, so they should also have a kind of heavy, tense, always vigilant, and mutually concerned emotion at this time. However, the actors are not calm, tense, quick, alert, and sensitive enough in this scene, making people feel that this meeting is very relaxed, so people cannot pay attention to them with a high degree of sympathy and respect. Another example is the scene where prison officer Karlinsky sends a pen to Fucik and establishes contact with him, which should also be very tense. Both of them have complex feelings: Fucik is unwilling to lose this opportunity to expand the scope of the struggle, but he is also wary that this may be a trap set by the enemy; Karlinsky has an awakened national self-esteem and patriotic enthusiasm, but he is afraid of not being trusted, and may also be reported due to misunderstanding, thereby suffering persecution. The struggle here is very complex and sharp, and the author deeply portrays the arduousness of the environment here, but the performances of Comrade Wu Xue and Comrade Guo Ping are not detailed and profound enough, lacking clear transitions and developments, so this very important scene is treated in a relatively easy and simple way. In the entire play, the rampant atmosphere of the fascist bandits is not strong enough; the oppressive atmosphere in the prison is not enough; the revolutionaries who are tortured in the prison lack the feeling of physical pain; the actors' costumes and makeup do not look like prisoners who are cruelly tortured by the enemy under Nazi rule, etc., which more or less weaken the degree of the arduousness of the environment.
    When the Youth Art Theater performed "Julius Fucik," the directors and actors made full preparations in advance. Such as investigating, collecting, researching, and analyzing relevant historical data about Czechoslovakia and Fucik's life, work, and study, which is absolutely necessary. However, the specific feeling and experience of the characters' personalities and their inner changes are not enough. The artists' high enthusiasm in creating the image has not been fully exerted, so he cannot discover or realize the characteristic actions that are needed in the role, but which the actor cannot calmly plan and are often unexpected. He cannot create some unique, non-transferable, and non-borrowable, persuasive "visualizations." Due to the restraint of the performance and the insufficient visualization, the enthusiasm and cruelty have not been fully expressed on the stage, so it seems that the pressure from the opposite side is not great enough, the strength of the positive struggle is not prominent enough, and the struggle is not intense enough.
    The significance of the China Youth Art Theater staging this very difficult to stage play today is by no means limited to pure artistic practice. After seeing the performance of this play, the Chinese people will be able to better understand the Czechoslovak people and more deeply understand the arduous struggle of the Czechoslovak people under Nazi oppression. Fucik's and other Czechoslovak patriots' heroic cause, through the translation and publication of "Report from the Gallows" and the staging of the play "Julius Fucik," deeply moved and educated the Chinese people, which has a great effect on enhancing the friendly unity between the Chinese and Czech people.

    评“尤利乌斯·伏契克”在首都的演出
    洪深
    编剧：尤·波掠柯夫斯基  导演：赵越、田蓝  副导演：萧崎
    中国青年艺术剧院演出
    在兄弟国家间文化交流的多种方式当中，上演关于对方的生活、工作和斗争的话剧是最有效的方式之一。正如互相派遣的歌舞团或互相举办展览会或互相翻译的影片那样，话剧可以和多数观众见面。而一个忠实、生动的演出，影响且将更为深刻。中国青年艺术剧院在首都演出的话剧“尤利乌斯·伏契克”（苏联剧作家尤·波掠柯夫斯基根据伏契克的遗著“绞刑架下的报告”及其他材料编写的），不仅使得中国人民对于捷克斯洛伐克人民的生活、斗争、理想，以及他们的坚强人格和优秀品质，有了更具体、更直接、更充分的认识，增加了对于他们更深厚的友爱，而且通过被体现在舞台上的伏契克的真实形象，和他为祖国人民的自由进行反对法西斯主义的坚贞不屈的革命战斗精神，更深刻地教育了观众，成为鼓舞中国人民为实现人类最美好的理想而英勇奋斗的不朽的榜样。把这样一个有重大历史意义的剧本，转化为舞台形象，活生生地、稳健而朴实地呈现在观众面前，这是一个光荣而又艰巨的任务。
    中国青年艺术剧院认真、严肃地对待“尤利乌斯·伏契克”的演出，导演、演员、舞台工作人员在演出之前，多方搜集和研究了有关尤利乌斯·伏契克的资料，努力追求真实。加上捷克斯洛伐克友人的热心帮助，因而整个戏的演出是严肃、朴实、稳健、忠实于当时历史真实的，没有浮夸与做作，没有不必要的装饰。演员们大都表演得很真实，尤其是剧中正面人物的革命者的气度、坚持信仰、自我牺牲、乐观主义精神，都很好地表现出来了。这里，可以看出导演和演员共同在现实主义道路上探索和追寻的朴实作风。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克是共产党的高级领导者，是一个敏锐、沉着、顽强、成熟的革命家，他始终坚持、并尽一切可能全心全意服务于捷克斯洛伐克人民反纳粹的斗争。他又是一个热情的、生命力旺盛的、创作力丰富的作家和诗人。吴雪同志所创造的伏契克形象是可爱、可敬而且可信的。他把伏契克的性格基本上表现出来了。例如第二场伏契克在工作一夜之后，含着深情地赞美黎明和春天时，在丽达责备他通夜不眠时，天真而正经地躺到床上去的开朗和单纯的心地；当他听到德寇进攻苏联后，立即草拟号召捷克斯洛伐克人民进行地下斗争时的激昂的情绪；伏契克在秘密集会场所计划“五一”节行动时突然为纳粹特务逮捕时的沉着、坚定态度；伏契克在“四○○号”候审室中对敌人的轻蔑的、讽刺的眼光；在监狱中怀着兴奋和希望的心情欢度自己的“五一”节，并领导大家唱国际歌时的庄严的神情；以及伏契克被送往柏林判决之前在狱中和老教员别塞克告别的一场中，都突出地、恰切地表现了伏契克充满信心、机智乐观、深思熟虑的判断和坚定稳实的气度。
    但是，伏契克除了具有勇敢、机智、党性这些革命者所应有的品质外，还有着一些鲜明的个性特征：爱生活、明快、乐观、尖锐、诙谐、生命力旺盛等。演员在塑造这个英雄人物时，必须把握住他的全部的精神世界，才能创造出一个具有高度党性与英勇精神的伏契克这个有血有肉的具体的人。因此，就整个艺术创造看来，吴雪同志还是比较偏重于表现伏契克作为一个革命者的品质，而属于伏契克的个性特征的地方，就表现得不够了。演员还没有投入到伏契克性格的深处，没有把伏契克那种对人民、对同志、对妻子的热烈的爱和对敌人的深切的憎表现得很强烈；并且还缺少与这种热烈情绪相适应的动作。他对妻子和同志的爱则显得不够热烈，不够奔放；特别是在后来，当敌人的压迫越加残酷时，同志间的关系将更加密切，更加热烈，而吴雪同志表演的内在情感则越发不够饱满。伏契克在监狱中读他自己的手稿“从门到窗子七步，从窗子到门七步”，和剧中伏契克的其他许多对话一样，是摘录自“绞刑架下的报告”中的名句。演员只有更深入地发掘出这些话的内涵意义，用相适应的感情、声调发挥出来，才能感染观众，引起观众的共鸣，伏契克的形象才能更丰满。在这些方面，演员还没有满足观众要求。
    石羽同志扮演的希特勒德国派在布拉格的专员——特务头子柏姆，也是一个难演的角色。既有种族优秀论者的自大狂，在占领捷克斯洛伐克之后更有征服者、统治者的优越感。柏姆的十足的兽性，充分表现出纳粹特务的阴险、毒辣、残暴。他仇恨共产党，仇恨人民。而他的狡猾、狠毒、残暴仍不免导致失败；他的狼狈、空虚、绝望乃使他疯狂。所有这些，都隐藏在伪善的面貌之中。这不是一个寻常的德寇，是伏契克斗争的对手。扮演柏姆的石羽同志没有像常见的表演“反派”人物那样，在表面上加以丑化，而是努力深入角色的内心，表现人物的性格特征。例如第一场，柏姆在和弗里特里赫谈话时，有这样一句：“老百姓？什么老百姓？一群畜牲！”石羽同志在这里不是作露骨的咒骂，却带着极度的轻蔑说出这句话来；他右手一摆，眼睛不看人，齿缝中轻声而用力地拼出两个字：“畜牲！”这里面，包含着极大的阴险和狠毒。又如在第六场，柏姆和玛丽亚太太有一长段的对话，忽然，他的声调变得低缓和柔和，因而更显得他那时候心中诡计之可怖。接着，玛丽亚进内室去了，我们看见柏姆那种自以为胜利了的狂妄的得意：他大步来回走着，掏出烟盒，抽烟，再递给卡尔，对卡尔说：“必须要懂得你所统治的人民。”但是，结果是出乎他的意料之外，玛丽亚并没有受骗，而是表现了革命者的大无畏的品质。这时候，他表现了失望和狼狈，咬牙切齿地说：“老妖怪！这样干会叫你够受的！”突然现出狰狞的面孔，疯狂地叫：“带走！”演员在这里一层一层地剥开了柏姆的伪装，显示了他丑恶的本质。
    但是，石羽同志在表现柏姆对伏契克作几次不同的攻击时的神情，每次都受到伏契克的坚强回击时的反应，特别是每次转折的地方，还不够明确和缺乏深度，因此这个人物的发展的层次就不够分明。在前三场中，柏姆的那种在种族优秀论支配下的民族自大狂还不够；在后几场中，敌我斗争逐渐深入，法西斯面临灭亡的命运，石羽同志表演的柏姆，在体现他们斗争中的更形老奸巨滑和内心的渐空虚、狼狈这些方面，不够深刻，因此就不能使观众深刻地体会到纳粹匪徒的全面的残暴与极度可恨。
    其他演员如饰老教员约塞夫·别塞克的江水同志，饰玛丽亚·叶林珂娃的蓝樱同志，饰古丝妲·伏契珂娃的路曦同志，饰安娜·克列曼脱丝的金淑之同志，也都创造了真实、生动的形象。
    尤利乌斯·伏契克和柏姆是贯串在整个剧本中的两条主线，是冲突和斗争的两个主将。在他们背后的，一方面是人民的队伍，他们英勇不屈，除了个别的（如米列克）动摇叛变外，更多的人们是觉醒了，参加了斗争，从而壮大了这个队伍；另一方面则是法西斯的阵营，他们狠毒、阴险、狡猾，然而他们尽管使用了各种卑劣的手段，仍然不能动摇人民的英雄们的斗争意志，所以他们终于还是失败了。尤利乌斯·伏契克虽然死了，但是，这位英雄的不屈服的大无畏的乐观主义精神却胜利了。这象征着人民和最终胜利。这个剧本正是表现伏契克精神的。中国青年艺术剧院的演出具有许多优点，并且总的说来是成功的，但是整个演出在表现这种精神上还显得不够充分，因而激动人心的力量也就不够强烈。譬如长风送舟，风是吹过来了，帆张舟动，亦在行进，但却无乘风破浪之势；又如野火烧山，火是烧起来了，熊熊不熄，正在蔓延，但我们尚不觉得有燎原之威，我们所希望感受到的磅礴气势还嫌不足。
    是什么原因呢？我认为除了在表现人物性格上的缺陷外，对当时斗争环境的表现还显得不够艰苦，整个戏的时代背景都处在法西斯统治时期，伏契克和他的同志们从事地下的斗争是处于十分不利的环境中。这一点需要着力刻划，而现在这种刻划却是不够的。例如第一场，伏契克和古丝妲的会见，是在公园中的秘密会见。他们是夫妻，所以这个会见应该是兴奋的、热情的；但是他们又是两个革命者，由于他们都肩负着地下斗争的任务，所以他们这时又应该有着一种沉重、紧张、始终警惕和互相关注的情绪。但是演员们在这一场中沉着、紧张、迅速、机警、敏感表现的不够，使人觉得这个会见好像很轻松，因而人们也就不能用一种高度同情与尊敬的心情来关注他们。又如监狱官考林斯基给伏契克送笔，并和他建立联系的一场，也应该是十分紧张的。两人都有复杂的心情：伏契克既不愿意失掉这个可以扩大斗争范围的机会，也警惕这可能是敌人布置的圈套；考林斯基既有着一种觉醒了的民族自尊心、爱国的热情，但又怕不被信任，并且还可能因误解而被告发，从而遭受迫害。这里斗争很复杂，也很尖锐，作者在这里深入地刻划了环境的艰苦，但吴雪同志和郭平同志的表演都还不够细致、深刻，缺乏明晰的转折和发展，因而这一段很重要的戏就被处理得较平易、简单了。在整个戏中，法西斯匪徒嚣张的气氛不够浓烈；监狱中压抑的气氛不够，在监狱中被拷打的革命者们缺乏肉体上痛苦的感觉；演员的服装、化装不像在纳粹统治下的受敌人残酷折磨的囚犯等等，都或多或少地削弱了环境的艰苦的程度。
    青年艺术剧院在上演“尤利乌斯·伏契克”时，不论导演、演员，事前都做了充分的准备工作。如调查、搜集、研究、分析有关捷克斯洛伐克的历史及与伏契克生前生活、工作、学习的有关资料等，这是绝对必要的。但对人物性格及其内心变化的具体感受和体验，则嫌用力不够，艺术家在创造形象中的高度热情未能得到充分地发挥，因此他就不能发现或发觉那在角色是需要的，但在演员却是无法冷静计划的而且常是意料不及的特点性的动作，他就不可能创造一些独到的，不能移之别处的，亦不能借问别人的，具有说服力的“视觉化”了。由于表演的拘谨而视觉化不够充分，热情和残酷尚未在舞台上丰满地表现出来，因而看来反面的压力不够大，正面斗争力量也不够凸出，斗争不够剧烈。
    中国青年艺术剧院在今天上演这个十分不易上演的话剧，它的意义决非仅限于单纯的艺术实践而已。中国人民在看到这个戏的上演后，就能够更好地了解捷克斯洛伐克人民，更深刻地认识捷克斯洛伐克人民在纳粹压迫下的坚苦的斗争。伏契克和其他捷克斯洛伐克爱国者的英雄事业，通过“绞刑架下的报告”的翻译出版，通过“尤利乌斯·伏契克”话剧的上演，深深地感动和教育了中国人民，这对于增强中捷两国人民的友好团结是有巨大的作用的。
