Xinhua News Agency, March 24th:

    Recently, U.S. government officials and military generals have been busy establishing military bases, signing military agreements, forming military alliances, and arming puppet armies in Asian regions surrounding China. Their central intention is to establish a military aggression line encircling China, maintain U.S. dominance over Asia, and maintain and deepen Asian and international tensions.

    As people know, the realization of the Korean armistice marked the failure of the American aggressors' plot to attack China by invading Korea. The Korean armistice brought some easing of international tensions. However, the American ruling group is not reconciled to all this. After the Korean armistice, the American ruling group stubbornly continued to implement the so-called "basic policy" of hostility towards the Chinese people. American newspapers and magazines openly discussed the U.S. government's strategy for dealing with China. According to a report in the American "Newsweek" at the end of last year, U.S. Vice President Nixon, after visiting Asian and Middle Eastern countries, suggested to the National Security Council the establishment of an "arc-shaped military defense line" and a "crescent-shaped military alliance" including Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Indochina, Taiwan, and Japan, to encircle China and the Soviet Union. "Newsweek" also said that this "arc-shaped military defense line" strategy had been approved by senior U.S. authorities. Facts show that the U.S. government is acting in accordance with this strategy.

    After the Korean armistice, the pressure from the people of the world to further ease tensions in Asia forced the United States to agree to convene the Geneva Conference at the Berlin Conference. The people of the world hope that, in order to promote positive results at the Geneva Conference, a favorable atmosphere for improving international relations should be created before the conference. However, the American ruling group is extremely afraid of the arrival of this favorable atmosphere. They are pursuing the opposite goal. After the Berlin Conference, the United States not only did not abandon but intensified its activities to establish an arc-shaped military aggression line. The following are some recent facts:

    In South Korea, the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed by the United States and Syngman Rhee attempts to permanently use South Korea as a U.S. military base. To this end, the United States is trying to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and obstruct the resolution of the Korean issue. The United States violated the Korean Armistice Agreement by illegally transporting a large number of reinforcing weapons and aircraft into South Korea and newly established four divisions for the Syngman Rhee group, which clamors for "marching north."

    In Indochina, which is considered the center of the "arc-shaped military defense line," the United States is further interfering in the colonial war there, attempting to seize its dominance and military command, arm a large number of puppet troops, and obstruct the realization of peace in Indochina through negotiations.

    In Japan, the United States and the Yoshida government recently signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," prompting Japan to accelerate rearmament and further strengthening its control over bases in Japan. The United States has repeatedly stated that it will permanently occupy Okinawa Island and is building permanent air force bases there.

    U.S. government officials and military generals are going to Taiwan, which is occupied by the United States, one after another. They are constantly shipping equipment to the Kuomintang remnant bandits. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson once said that one of the United States' "basic strategies" is to use Taiwan to maintain a constant military threat to China.

    The United States is expanding its military bases in the Philippines, attempting to turn the Philippines into the "southern hub" and "strategic supply center" of the U.S. aggressive military base network.

    It is turning Thailand into a military bridgehead. Under the supervision of American advisors, Thailand is building military facilities and strategic highways, and constructing new air and naval bases. Americans are training Thai troops.

    Recently, the United States announced that it would provide Pakistan with military "aid." The United States will conduct negotiations with Pakistan to establish air force bases in Pakistan. American officials have openly stated that the bases in Pakistan will be a "link" in the United States' worldwide air force "chain." Under the planning of the United States, Pakistan and Turkey are about to sign a military agreement.

    American newspapers explain that these U.S.-Rhee agreements, U.S.-Japan agreements, U.S.-Pakistan agreements, Turkish-Pakistan agreements, as well as opposing the restoration of peace in Indochina and striving to expand the Asian military base network and other aggressive activities, are all preparatory steps for the United States to establish an entire military alliance in the Far East and the Middle East, that is, the aforementioned "crescent-shaped military alliance."

    The purpose of all these aggressive activities by the United States was made very clear by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson. He said in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee on January 26 that the "essence" of the U.S. government's policy is to "indefinitely maintain U.S. dominance in the Far East" and maintain a "constant threat of aggression against Red China." Obviously, the measures taken by the United States to establish this arc-shaped military aggression line are in fact not only intended to be hostile to the People's Republic of China, but also to attempt to use such a military chain to lock up the people of all of Asia, so as to indefinitely maintain the dominance of the United States in Asia.

    This shows that the American ruling group has not learned a lesson from the disastrous defeat on the Chinese mainland, nor from the experience of being battered and bleeding in Korea. History proves that the power politics of foreign dominators are suffering one defeat after another in Asia. The people of Asia are rising from under the various chains of these foreign dominators. But the United States stubbornly wants to maintain their dominance, not hesitating to drive Asians to fight Asians for this purpose. As the saying goes, "He who refuses to learn a lesson will have to pay the price himself to learn that lesson."

### 美国加紧进行敌视中国人民的侵略部署  妄图继续奴役亚洲人民加深国际紧张局势

    美国加紧进行敌视中国人民的侵略部署
    妄图继续奴役亚洲人民加深国际紧张局势
    【新华社二十四日讯】最近以来，美国政府官员及军事将领正忙着在中国周围的亚洲地区建立军事基地，签订军事协定，成立军事联盟，武装傀儡军队。其中心意图就是在建立一条包围中国的军事侵略线，保持美国对亚洲的支配地位，保持和加深亚洲及国际紧张局势。
    人们知道，朝鲜停战的实现标志着美国侵略者企图通过侵略朝鲜来进攻中国的阴谋的失败。朝鲜停战的实现使得国际紧张局势有一些缓和。但是，美国统治集团对于这一切是不甘心的。在朝鲜停战以后，美国统治集团顽固地继续执行敌视中国人民的所谓“基本政策”。美国报纸杂志上公开谈论着美国政府对付中国的战略。据美国“新闻周刊”去年年底报道，美国副总统尼克松在访问亚洲和中东国家后，向国家安全委员会建议建立一个包括土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、印度支那、台湾和日本在内的“弧形军事防线”和“半月形军事联盟”，以把中国和苏联包围起来。“新闻周刊”并且说，这个“弧形军事防线”战略已得到美国高级当局的批准。事实说明，美国政府正是按照这个战略行事的。
    在朝鲜停战后，世界人民要求进一步缓和亚洲紧张局势的压力，使得美国在柏林会议上不得不同意召开日内瓦会议。世界人民都希望，为了促使日内瓦会议获得积极成果，在会前应该创造一种改善国际关系的有利空气。但是，美国统治集团却异常害怕这种有利空气的到来。他们追求着与此相反的目标。在柏林会议以后，美国不仅没有放弃，而且加紧了建立弧形军事侵略线的活动。下面就是最近的一些事实：
    在南朝鲜，美国与李承晚签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，企图永远把南朝鲜作为美国的军事基地。为了这个目的，美国正在力图保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，阻挠朝鲜问题的解决。美国违反朝鲜停战协定，把大批增援性的武器和飞机非法运入南朝鲜，替叫嚣“向北进军”的李承晚集团新建立了四个师。
    在被认为“弧形军事防线”中心的印度支那，美国正在进一步干涉那里的殖民战争，正在企图夺取那里的统治权和军事指挥权，武装大量傀儡军队，阻挠在印度支那通过谈判，实现和平。
    在日本，美国与吉田政府最近签订了所谓“共同防御援助协定”，促使日本加速重新武装并进一步加强对日本基地的控制。美国并一再声称要永远占领冲绳岛，正在那里建筑永久空军基地。
    美国政府官员及军事将领正一个接着一个的到美国侵占下的台湾去。他们不断运送装备去给国民党残余匪帮。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊曾说，美国的一个“基本战略”就是要利用台湾，对中国保持经常的军事威胁。
    美国正在扩大在菲律宾的军事基地，企图把菲律宾变为美国侵略军事基地网的“南部枢纽”和“战略供应中心”。
    它正在把泰国变为军事桥头堡。在美国顾问的监督下，泰国正在修建军事设备与战略公路，修建新的空军及海军基地。美国人正在训练着泰国军队。
    最近美国宣布要给予巴基斯坦以军事“援助”。美国将要与巴基斯坦进行在巴基斯坦建立空军基地的谈判。美国人士公开说，在巴基斯坦的基地将是美国世界范围的空军“锁链”中的一个“环节”。在美国策划下，巴基斯坦与土耳其即将签订军事协定。
    美国报纸说明，这些美李协定、美日协定、美巴协定、土巴协定以及反对恢复印度支那的和平，竭力扩大亚洲军事基地网等等侵略活动，都是美国企图建立远东及中东整个军事联盟，也就是上述“半月形军事联盟”的准备步骤。
    美国所有这些侵略活动的目的，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊讲得很清楚。他一月二十六日在美国众议院拨款委员会上作证时说，美国政府的政策的“实质”就是“要在远东无限期地保持美国的支配地位”，保持“对红色中国进攻的经常威胁”。很显然，美国建立这个弧形军事侵略线的措施事实上不仅是为了敌视中华人民共和国，而且是企图用这样一条军事锁链来锁住全亚洲的人民，以便无限期地保持美国在亚洲的支配地位。
    这就说明，美国统治集团还是没有从在中国大陆上惨败中，从在朝鲜碰得头破血流的经验中得到教训。历史证明：外来支配者的实力政策正在亚洲遭受一个接一个的惨败。亚洲人民正在从这些外来支配者的各种锁链下站起来。但美国却顽固地要保持他们的支配地位，不惜为了这个而驱使亚洲人打亚洲人。俗话说得好：“谁拒绝接受教训，他自己就要付出代价来学到这个教训。”
