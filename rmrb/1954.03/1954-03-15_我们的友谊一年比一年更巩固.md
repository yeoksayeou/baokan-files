Our Friendship Grows Stronger Year by Year
By our reporter Lu Sheng

March 14th marks the first anniversary of the death of Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people, and a close friend of the Chinese people. On the eve of this day—the evening of March 13th—the peasants of Zhangguozhuang Township in the suburbs of Beijing, who have established regular contact with the working people of the Czechoslovak Republic, and all members of the agricultural producers' cooperative in the township, solemnly held a memorial meeting for the first anniversary of Comrade Gottwald's death.

As early as the winter of 1950, Zhangguozhuang Township established friendly relations with the people of the Czechoslovak Republic. This relationship began with the first visit to the township by Comrade Kousal, the Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to China, representing the Czechoslovak people. During Ambassador Kousal's second visit to the township, he brought a letter of condolence personally written by President Gottwald, which greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the farmers in the township. The names "Sino-Czech Friendship," "Czechoslovak Republic," and Comrade Gottwald" were deeply etched in the hearts of the people of the township. From then on, Zhangguozhuang Township and the people of Czechoslovakia established friendly contact through correspondence. In the past four years, during every "May Day" and "National Day" holiday, Ambassador Kousal and various Czechoslovak delegations to China would invariably visit Zhangguozhuang Township, and each time they were received by all the farmers of Zhangguozhuang Township as if they were relatives. The friendship between the two peoples grows stronger year by year, and more intimate each time. Last April, Ambassador Kousal again visited Zhangguozhuang Township, bringing with him tractors, water pumps, small animal-drawn farm implements, walking plows, etc., sent by the farmers of Vinarice Village in the Czechoslovak Republic. These machines were bought with saved money. These machines helped Zhangguozhuang Township improve its production. In 1953, the township produced a total of 1.33 million catties of grain, an increase of 63 percent over previous years. Of the 34 cooperative members in the township's agricultural producers' cooperative, 21 members increased their income by more than double compared to previous years, and the remaining members also increased their income by more than 50 percent compared to previous years, and sold 35,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. Therefore, it was honorably named a model agricultural producers' cooperative in Beijing. The farmers of the entire township fully understand that these achievements are inseparable from the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and from the selfless assistance of the working people of the Czechoslovak Republic. Cooperative member Huang Fucai said at the meeting: "The working farmers of the Czechoslovak Republic are on the same path as us. In the future, we must hold hands more closely, encourage each other, support each other, and advance towards the bright road of socialist society."

At the memorial meeting for the first anniversary of Comrade Gottwald's death, Guo Rong, director of the Zhangguozhuang Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, and Wang Liang, the township head, both recounted Comrade Gottwald's deep friendship and multifaceted assistance to Zhangguozhuang Township. They want to commemorate their close friend Comrade Gottwald with practical production achievements. Many members of the agricultural producers' cooperative expressed their determination in front of Comrade Gottwald's portrait that in future production, they will work hard to learn the collective production spirit of the working class, run the agricultural producers' cooperative well, and lead all the farmers in the township to advance together towards socialist society. Finally, all the farmers and all the members of the agricultural producers' cooperative unanimously passed a letter to all the farmers of Vinarice Village in the Czechoslovak Republic and all the members of the unified agricultural cooperative in that village in memory of Comrade Gottwald.

The letter first said: Today is the first anniversary of the death of Comrade Gottwald, the great leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people, and a close friend of the Chinese people. All the farmers and all the members of the agricultural producers' cooperative in Zhangguozhuang Township, like you, commemorate him with infinite remembrance. On the night of March 13th, all of our farmers and all of our cooperative members held a memorial meeting. At the meeting, everyone expressed their determination to commemorate him with practical actions such as doing a good job in spring plowing and running the agricultural producers' cooperative well.

After describing the township's production achievements in 1953, the letter specifically pointed out: The achievement of these production results is inseparable from the wise leadership of our Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and from your brotherly assistance.

The letter also told all the farmers of Vinarice Village and the members of the unified agricultural cooperative: After learning the general line of our Chinese Communist Party during the transition period last winter, all the farmers of Zhangguozhuang Township clearly recognized the path they should take. At the same time, due to the good harvest of the agricultural producers' cooperative last year, which further proved the superiority of collective production, the farmers of the entire township have been asking to join the agricultural producers' cooperative since the autumn harvest last year. In order to better meet the needs of farmers and to connect the scattered small plots of land into large tracts of land in order to exert the effectiveness of machines more powerfully, we also merged with our neighboring village (Dongheyanzhen Township) with the help of our party and government. In this way, our agricultural producers' cooperative has expanded from 34 households last year to 381 households (accounting for 58.8 percent of the total number of households in the township), and the cultivated area has also expanded to more than 5,800 mu (accounting for 60 percent of the township's cultivated area). All the members have realized through studying the general line that learning and using machine production is an important condition for increasing yields, so not long after you sent us the machines, four young comrades from our cooperative went to the state tractor station to learn how to drive tractors. Everyone recognizes that running the agricultural producers' cooperative well can gradually lead to a better and happier socialist society. In order to accelerate the industrialization of our country, we must increase the production of more grain and oil crops to support national construction. In 1954, our cooperative plans to sow 570 mu of corn, with a yield of 350 catties per mu, an increase of 40 percent over last year; to plant 1,000 mu of millet, with a yield of 300 catties per mu, an increase of 54 percent over last year; to sow 1,200 mu of peanuts, with a yield of 300 catties per mu, an increase of 25 percent over last year; and various other crops are also required to increase by more than 20 percent over last year.

The letter concluded by saying: On the occasion of commemorating the first anniversary of Comrade Gottwald's death, we must further strengthen the relationship of Sino-Czech friendship, unite more closely in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strive to jointly defend world peace and transition to a better and happier socialist society more quickly.

    我们的友谊一年比一年更巩固
    本报记者　鲁生
    三月十四日是捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民的伟大领袖、我们中国人民的亲密的朋友哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年的日子。在这日子的前夕——三月十三日晚上，曾和捷克斯洛伐克共和国劳动人民建立经常联系的北京市郊区张郭庄乡的农民和这乡的农业生产合作社全体社员，隆重举行了哥特瓦尔德同志逝世周年的纪念大会。
    张郭庄乡早在一九五○年冬，就和捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民建立起友谊关系。这种关系，是从捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻华大使康萨拉同志第一次代表捷克斯洛伐克人民访问该乡开始的。在康萨拉大使第二次访问该乡时，带去了由哥特瓦尔德总统亲自写的慰问信，这封信有力地鼓舞了全乡农民的生产情绪，“中捷友谊”、“捷克斯洛伐克共和国”和“哥特瓦尔德”同志的名字，就深深地留在全乡人们的心里，从此张郭庄乡和捷克斯洛伐克人民就建立了书信来往的友谊联系。在过去的四年里，每逢“五一”和“十一”佳节时，康萨拉大使和捷克斯洛伐克来我国的各种代表团必定要到张郭庄乡去访问，每一次都受到张郭庄乡全体农民亲人般地接待。两国人民之间的友谊一年比一年更巩固，一次比一次更亲密。去年四月里，康萨拉大使又带着捷克斯洛伐克共和国维纳尔日采村农民送给他们的拖拉机、抽水机、小型马拉农具、步犁等去访问张郭庄乡。这些机器是用节省下的钱买的。这些机器帮助了张郭庄乡提高了生产。一九五三年，全乡共生产粮食一百三十三万斤，比往年增产百分之六十三。该乡农业生产合作社全社三十四户社员，就有二十一户社员比往年的收入增加一倍以上，其余的社员也都比往年收入增加百分之五十以上，并把三万五千斤余粮卖给国家。因此光荣地被评选为北京市模范农业生产合作社。全乡的农民完全懂得，这些成绩的获得是和中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，是和捷克斯洛伐克共和国劳动人民的无私援助分不开的。社员黄富才在大会上说：“捷克斯洛伐克共和国的劳动农民和我们所走的道路是一样的，今后我们更要亲密携起手来，互相勉励，互相支援，向着社会主义社会的光明大道前进。”
    在纪念哥特瓦尔德同志逝世周年纪念大会上，张郭庄乡农业生产合作社主任郭荣、乡长王亮都追述了哥特瓦尔德同志对张郭庄乡的深挚友谊和多方面的援助。他们要用实际的生产成绩来纪念亲密的朋友哥特瓦尔德同志。许多农业生产合作社社员都在哥特瓦尔德同志的遗像前表示了自己的决心，要在今后生产中，努力学习工人阶级的集体生产精神，把农业生产合作社办好；带动全乡农民一齐向社会主义社会前进。最后全体农民和全体农业生产合作社社员一致通过了为纪念哥特瓦尔德同志致捷克斯洛伐克共和国维纳尔日采村全体农民和这村的统一农业合作社全体社员一封信。
    信里首先说：今天是捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民的伟大领袖、我们中国人民亲密的朋友哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年纪念日，我们张郭庄乡全体农民和农业生产合作社全体社员也和你们一样，都以无限怀念的心情来纪念他。在三月十三日的夜里我们全体农民和全体社员特举行了纪念会，会上大家都纷纷表示要以做好春耕生产、搞好农业生产合作社的实际行动来纪念他。
    信中叙述过全乡一九五三年的生产成绩后，特别指出：这些生产成绩的取得，是和我国共产党、毛主席的英明领导，和你们兄弟般的援助分不开的。
    这封信还告诉维纳尔日采村全体农民和统一农业合作社社员：张郭庄乡全体农民由于经过去冬学习了我们中国共产党在过渡时期的总路线后，大家都明确认识了自己应走的道路。同时还由于去年农业生产合作社的丰收，更证明了集体生产的优越性，所以去年秋收后，全乡农民纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。为了更满足农民大家的要求，使分散经营的小块土地连成大片土地，以便更有力地发挥机器的效力，我们又在我们党和政府的帮助下，和我们的邻村（东河沿乡）合并在一起。这样我们的农业生产合作社就由去年的三十四户扩大成了三百八十一户（占全乡总户数的百分之五十八点八），耕地面积也扩大到五千八百多亩（占全乡耕地面积百分之六十）的大社了。全体社员们通过学习总路线都认识了学习和使用机器生产是提高产量的重要条件，所以你们送给我们的机器不多天，我们社就有四个青年同志到国家的拖拉机站去学习驾驶拖拉机了。大家认识到办好农业生产合作社，就可逐步走到美好幸福的社会主义社会去。为了加速我国的工业化，我们就要增产更多的粮食和油料作物来支援国家的建设。一九五四年我们全社计划要播种玉米五百七十亩，每亩产到三百五十斤，比去年增产百分之四十；要种谷子一千亩，每亩产到三百斤，比去年增产百分之五十四；播种花生一千二百亩，每亩产到三百斤，比去年增产百分之二十五，其余各种农作物也都要求比去年增产百分之二十以上。
    信的最后说：在纪念哥特瓦尔德同志逝世一周年的时候，我们要更进一步加强中捷友谊的关系，更紧密地团结在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营里，为共同保卫世界和平，为更快地过渡到美好幸福的社会主义社会而努力。
