　　Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 27th: The Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concluded on the 25th.

　　Soviet representative, Mr. Kumykin, spoke at the conclusion of the meeting. He pointed out that this session proved that there has been significant progress in expanding and consolidating economic cooperation among countries around the world, which is a characteristic of the overall situation recently. The Soviet representative said that the meeting also proved that there are still significant difficulties on the road to economic cooperation, but these difficulties can be overcome. Now there is a general recognition of the necessity of close economic cooperation among countries around the world.

　　The chairman of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Mr. Urich, pointed out at the close of the meeting that the issue of developing trade and eliminating all obstacles to economic cooperation can be said to be the main work of the Ninth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

　　Before closing, the meeting also discussed the activities of the Agriculture Committee and the "European Agricultural Issues" report submitted by the Secretariat of the Economic Commission. Representatives of many countries pointed out that the current state of agriculture in some European countries cannot meet the needs of the people and the food manufacturing industry. This has led to a reduction in post-war food consumption.

　　Representatives of the Soviet Republics and the People's Democracies said that one of the main reasons for the slow development of agriculture in Western European countries after the war is that the militarization of the economies of these countries is having an adverse impact on agriculture, as well as the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized farmers who are struggling against large monopoly capital.

　　Soviet representative Mr. Kumykin emphasized that the situation of European agriculture can be improved as long as the trade in agricultural products among all European countries is expanded, and Europe does not rely on overseas agricultural imports.

　　The proposals of the Soviet Union and Denmark were unanimously adopted. This proposal believes that the activities of the Agriculture Committee should be restored and decides to convene a meeting of the Agriculture Committee in 1954.

　　The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution expressing the hope that the issue of expanding and strengthening economic relations between European countries will be included in the committee's two-year work plan. This proposal was unanimously adopted, reflecting the desire of European countries to expand world trade, especially trade between Eastern and Western Europe.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 26th: On March 24th, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe passed a resolution on inter-regional cooperation, namely economic cooperation between Europe and Asian and Far Eastern countries, and between Europe and Latin American countries.

　　The resolution pointed out that the meeting on intra-European trade held under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe was very successful, and recommended that the United Nations Economic and Social Council meeting discuss the proposal to convene expert trade meetings between Europe and Asian and Far Eastern countries, and between Europe and Latin American countries, which may help expand world trade.

　　Soviet representative Mr. Kumykin pointed out in his speech: The Soviet delegation believes that when the expert trade meeting between European countries and Asian and Far Eastern countries is convened, experts from the People's Republic of China should participate. The Soviet representative pointed out the importance of the People's Republic of China's participation in world trade, which was also pointed out by representatives of some other countries participating in the meeting.

　　The Soviet representative's speech was supported by representatives from the Ukrainian Republic, the Belorussian Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

　　The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe also discussed the secretariat's proposed committee activity plan for 1954-1955.

　　Soviet representative Mr. Kumykin pointed out that this plan did not include the views and wishes expressed by the Soviet Union and other countries' representatives when discussing the work of the committee. In particular, the representatives had urged that attention should be paid to guiding the work of the various committees and the entire Economic Commission for Europe along a more practical line, so that their activities would contribute to a greater extent to solving the central issue of establishing trade and economic relations between European countries.

　　The Soviet delegation put forward a proposal on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's plan for 1954-1955, informing the Executive Secretary of the Committee that, after consultation with the relevant committees, a work plan should be redrafted, and the following new issues related to strengthening European economic cooperation should be added: developing economic relations between Eastern and Western European countries, and eliminating obstacles to world trade.

    联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议闭幕
    苏联代表指出各国经济合作有很大进展
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦二十六日讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议已于二十五日闭幕。
    苏联代表库米金于会议结束时发言。他指出，本届会议证明了扩大和巩固世界各国之间的经济合作已有了很大的进展，这是最近整个局势的一个特点。苏联代表说，会议也证明了在经济合作的道路上还存在着重大的困难，但是，这些困难是能够克服的。现在大家已经普遍地认识到世界各国之间的密切的经济合作的必要性。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会主席乌里赫在会议闭幕时指出，发展贸易和消除经济合作的一切障碍的问题，可以说是联合国欧洲经济委员会第九届会议的主要工作。
    会议在闭幕前，还讨论了农业委员会的活动和经济委员会秘书处提出的“欧洲农业问题”的报告书。许多国家的代表指出，某些欧洲国家的农业现状不能满足人民和食品制造工业的需要。这使得战后的食品消费量减少了。
    苏维埃共和国和人民民主国家的代表说，战后西欧国家农业发展缓慢的主要原因之一是这些国家的经济军事化正对农业起着不利的影响，还有对大垄断资本进行艰苦斗争的中小农的破产。
    苏联代表库米金强调指出，欧洲农业的情况是可以改善的，只要扩大所有欧洲国家间的农产品贸易、使欧洲不要依靠海外的农产品进口。
    苏联和丹麦的提案获得一致通过。这个提案认为应该恢复农业委员会的活动，并决定在一九五四年召开农业委员会会议。
    会议一致通过决议，表示希望把有关扩大和加强欧洲各国经济关系的问题列入委员会两年的工作。这个提案获得一致通过，这反映了欧洲国家要扩大世界贸易、特别是东西欧之间的贸易的愿望。
   【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦讯：联合国欧洲经济委员会在三月二十四日通过一项关于区域间合作，即欧洲与亚洲和远东国家之间的经济合作以及欧洲与拉丁美洲国家之间的经济合作的决议。
    决议指出，联合国欧洲经济委员会主持召开的关于欧洲内部贸易的会议开得很成功，并建议联合国经社理事会会议讨论关于召开欧洲与亚洲和远东国家，以及欧洲与拉丁美洲国家的专家贸易会议的建议，这种会议可能有助于扩大世界贸易。
    苏联代表库米金发言指出：苏联代表团认为，在欧洲国家与亚洲和远东国家专家贸易会议召开的时候，应该有中华人民共和国的专家参加。苏联代表指出了中华人民共和国参加世界贸易的重要性，参加会议的其他一些国家的代表也指出了这一点。
    苏联代表的发言得到乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表的支持。
    联合国欧洲经济委员会还讨论了秘书处提出的一九五四—一九五五年委员会活动计划。
    苏联代表库米金指出，这个计划没有把苏联与其他国家的代表在讨论委员会的工作时所表示的看法与愿望包括进去。特别是代表们曾促使注意应该引导各委员会以及整个欧洲经济委员会的工作走更实际的路线，俾使它们的活动在更大的程度上有助于解决建立欧洲各国之间的贸易与经济关系的中心问题。
    苏联代表团就联合国欧洲经济委员会一九五四—一九五五年的计划提出一项建议，通知委员会执行秘书在与有关委员会协商后，重新草拟一个工作计划，并把下列有关加强欧洲经济合作的新问题补充进去：发展东西欧国家之间的经济关系，消除世界贸易的障碍。
