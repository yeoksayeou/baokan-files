Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 28th: The Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions concluded on the 26th the discussion of the report made by Liu Changsheng, Secretary of the WFTU, on "The struggle to win recognition and implementation of the basic principles of defending trade union rights and the preparation for the 1954 International Labor Day 'May 1'," and heard the report on the third agenda item.

Speaking during the discussion of Liu Changsheng's report were WFTU Vice-President Ayono (Indonesia) and Diallo (Africa), among others.

WFTU President Vittorio pointed out in his speech that the issue of protecting and fighting for trade union rights is one of the most important issues in the work of the WFTU. This issue should be closely linked to the struggle to achieve economic demands. Capitalists in various countries are trying to intensify exploitation to ensure they obtain maximum profits and turn the working people into their docile slaves, so they are committed to depriving trade unions of their rights. Vittorio supported Liu Changsheng's proposal to establish a committee to draft a charter of trade union rights.

WFTU Vice-President Alain Le Léap and WFTU Secretary Jourdain also expressed their opinions on this issue.

After Liu Changsheng made a concluding speech on the discussion of the second agenda item, WFTU Secretary Grassi made a report on "The activities and tasks of the Trade Union Internationals (Industrial Departments of the WFTU)."

Grassi said: In recent years, the Trade Union Internationals have done a great deal of work in strengthening the unity among working people in various professions. The Trade Union Internationals have formulated programs of economic and social demands for working people's groups in various professions and discussed them in many countries. Due to the activities of the Trade Union Internationals, the struggle of the working people to defend their vital rights has become more active.

Grassi gave a detailed explanation of the tasks of the Trade Union Internationals. He said: We should strengthen the unity of action of the working people in the struggle to improve living standards, combat unemployment, and demand full employment. Grassi concluded by putting forward some concrete suggestions for improving the activities of the Trade Union Internationals for discussion at the conference.

Berezin, a member of the Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, spoke in support of the following suggestions: The WFTU Executive Bureau should, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress, formulate a draft charter of the trade union rights and democratic freedoms of the working people, and submit the draft to various trade union organizations for discussion. Berezin also suggested that the Trade Union Internationals should participate more actively in the various committees of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the International Labour Organization in order to raise important issues concerning the vital interests of the working people and expand contacts with trade unions in various countries.

    世界工联执行局结束第二项议程的讨论
    葛拉西作各工会国际的活动与任务的报告
   【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界工会联合会执行局会议二十六日结束了世界工联书记刘长胜所作关于“争取承认和履行保卫工会权利的基本原则的斗争和一九五四年‘五一’国际劳动节的筹备工作”的报告的讨论，并听取了第三项议程的报告。
    在讨论刘长胜报告时发言的有世界工联副主席艾约诺（印度尼西亚）和迪亚洛（非洲）等。
    世界工联主席维多里奥在发言中指出，保护和争取工会权利的问题，是世界工联工作中的一个最重要的问题。这个问题应当与为达到经济要求的斗争紧密地联系起来。各国资本家力图加紧剥削以保证自己获得最大限度的利润，把劳动人民变成自己驯服的奴隶，因此他们致力于剥夺工会权利。维多里奥支持刘长胜所提关于成立一个委员会来起草工会权利章程的建议。
    世界工联副主席阿兰·勒里普和世界工联书记儒丹也对这个问题发表了意见。
    在刘长胜就第二项议程的讨论作了总结发言后，世界工联书记葛拉西作了“各工会国际（世界工联产业部）的活动与任务”的报告。
    葛拉西说：各工会国际最近几年来在加强各种职业的劳动人民之间的团结方面作了许多工作。各工会国际制定了各种职业的劳动人民团体的经济与社会要求的纲领，并在许多国家中进行了讨论。由于各工会国际的活动，劳动人民为保卫自己切身权利的斗争更加积极了。
    葛拉西对各工会国际的任务作了详尽的说明。他说：我们应当加强劳动人民在争取提高生活水平、反对失业、要求完全就业的斗争中行动的统一。葛拉西最后提出了一些改善各工会国际活动的具体建议交给大会讨论。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席团委员别列津发言支持下列建议：世界工联执行局应根据世界工会第三次代表大会的决议拟定劳动人民工会权利和民主自由的宪章草案，并将该草案提交各种工会组织进行讨论。别列津并建议各工会国际更加积极地参加联合国经社理事会的各委员会与国际劳工组织，以便提出劳动人民切身的重要问题和扩大与各国工会的联系。
