    Xinjiang's Multi-ethnic Literary and Art Workers Organize Creation Groups
    The Xinjiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently organized literary and art workers from seven ethnic groups among its members, including Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Xibe, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek, into three creation groups to go deep into the masses for creative work.
    The creation groups are divided into three subgroups: Southern Xinjiang, pastoral areas, and industrial areas. They will go to various regions from March to November to experience life and engage in creative work. The work plan of the creation groups stipulates that each member participating in the creation group must not only create a work but also collect folk literature, works by folk artists, historical literary materials, and biographical materials about classical writers and poets. The activities of the creation groups will take Xinjiang's literary and artistic creation a step forward.

    新疆各族文艺工作者组织创作组
    新疆省文学艺术工作者联合会，最近将会员中的汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙古、锡伯、柯尔克孜、乌孜别克等七个民族的文艺工作者，组织了三个创作组，深入到群众中去，进行创作。
    创作组分南疆、牧区和工业区三个小组，将于三月至十一月间，分别到各地区去体验生活，进行创作。创作小组的工作计划中规定：参加创作小组的每个人，除了要创作一个作品外，并要搜集民间文艺、民间艺人的作品、历史文艺材料和有关古典作家诗人的传记材料等。创作小组的活动将会使新疆的文艺创作，向前跨进一步。
