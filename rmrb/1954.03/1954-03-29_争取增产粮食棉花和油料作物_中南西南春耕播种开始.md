Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 28th: Farmers in the six provinces of Central-South China are actively engaged in spring plowing and production. Farmers in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have already sown early rice seedling fields, and rice transplanting is widespread in the areas south of the Pearl River. Farmers of all ethnic groups on Hainan Island have begun weeding. Farmers in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces have plowed terraced fields, prepared seedling fields, and begun spring sowing. In some areas of Henan Province, farmers have begun sowing cotton and flue-cured tobacco; early tobacco in the Xuchang area has already been planted.

This year's spring plowing in Central-South China marks the beginning of a large-scale production movement centered on the mutual aid and cooperation movement, aimed at increasing the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops for the country. During the preparation period for spring plowing before and after the Spring Festival, the planned and guided mutual aid and cooperation movement unfolded successively in various places. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,600 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established throughout the region (bringing the total number of old and new cooperatives to more than 4,600). Driven by agricultural production cooperatives, the number of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations has reached 38.7% of the total number of farm households in the region. As soon as all agricultural production cooperatives and some mutual aid teams were organized, they formulated this year's production increase plans and immediately joined all farm households in water conservancy construction, fertilizer production and accumulation, and other spring plowing preparations.

This year, the total grain output in the Central-South region is expected to increase by 5.7% compared to last year, and the total cotton output is expected to increase by about 29%. Without affecting grain production increases, the total oil crop output is expected to increase by 18%, and the total tea output is also expected to increase by 7% compared to last year. To achieve this production increase plan, the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call for spring plowing production as early as late February, requiring all localities to continue to conduct in-depth general line education among farmers with mutual aid and cooperation as the central content, earnestly manage the agricultural production cooperatives that have been established and are being established, and do a good job in various spring plowing production tasks. At present, the state banks in Central-South provinces are vigorously issuing agricultural loans in rural areas, and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels are supplying farmers with the commodities, fertilizers, new and old agricultural tools, draught animals, and seeds they currently need. They have also organized handicraftsmen to process and repair agricultural tools for farmers.

In addition, although the preparations for spring plowing in the Central-South region started early this year, the winter plowing and winter planting were relatively rough, the planned water conservancy construction was poorly completed, the fertilizer preparation was insufficient, and the sideline production was less because the rural areas were carrying out the general line propaganda movement and grain purchase work before the Spring Festival. After the Spring Festival, the provinces successively grasped the leadership of the farmers' preparation work, concentrated on repairing small-scale irrigation projects such as ponds, dams, and ditches, built a number of new irrigation projects, and called on farmers to produce and accumulate fertilizers. Because these tasks were grasped tightly by all localities, they have now come to a successful end.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 28th: Spring plowing has begun in some areas of Southwest China. Luzhou, Neijiang, Yibin, Fuling, Jiangjin and other special districts in Sichuan Province, and Jinping, Jinggu and other counties in Yunnan Province have begun sowing; other areas will also gradually begin in the near future.

Party committees at all levels in the Southwest region and local people's governments have strengthened their leadership over spring plowing. On March 18, the Southwest Administrative Committee issued instructions on spring plowing production work, pointing out that doing a good job in spring plowing is one of the decisive keys to realizing this year's agricultural production increase plan. Most of the party and government leading organs at the provincial, special district, and county levels in Sichuan Province have transferred cadres to the countryside to inspect and lead spring plowing. In Fuling Special District alone, there are 4,000 cadres going to the countryside. Jiangjin Special District has trained more than 40,000 key personnel to lead production and put them into spring plowing production.

The financial, economic, transportation and other departments in various parts of Southwest China are actively supporting farmers in carrying out spring plowing production. According to the statistics of 78 county and city supply and marketing cooperatives in Sichuan Province alone, as of the end of January, more than 3.8 million pieces of agricultural tools had been prepared and ordered from handicraftsmen, an increase of eleven times compared to the number of agricultural tools supplied to farmers by the province's supply and marketing cooperatives from January to April last year. The supply and marketing cooperatives in 37 counties in Guizhou Province have now stored more than 1 million pieces of iron, bamboo, and wooden agricultural tools, tens of millions of catties of oil cake, bone meal, and other fertilizers, and a portion of draft cattle and piglets. People's banks in various places have begun to issue agricultural loans. This year, the Southwest region plans to issue 1.2 trillion yuan in agricultural loans, an increase of 20% over last year. Most of the fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery and other materials needed by farmers in Southwest China for spring plowing production, supplied by major cities across the country, have arrived in Chongqing and are being rapidly transported to various places by trains, ships, automobiles, and other means of transportation.

### 争取增产粮食棉花和油料作物  中南西南春耕播种开始

    争取增产粮食棉花和油料作物
    中南西南春耕播种开始
   【新华社武汉二十八日电】中南六省农民正积极进行春耕生产。广东和广西两省农民已播种早稻秧田，珠江以南地区已普遍插秧，海南岛各民族农民已开始耘田。湖南、江西和湖北三省农民已翻耕坂田、整治秧田，开始春播。河南省部分地区农民已开始播种棉花和烤烟，许昌地区的早烟已经种下。
    中南区今年的春耕，是一个以互助合作运动为中心的、为国家增产粮食棉花和油料作物的大规模生产运动的开始。在春节前后的准备春耕期间，有计划有领导的互助合作运动就在各地先后展开。据目前的不完全统计，全区已新建成农业生产合作社三千六百多个（连老社合计为四千六百多个）。在农业生产合作社的带动下，全区参加互助合作组织的农户已达全区农户总数的百分之三十八点七。所有农业生产合作社和部分互助组一组织起来，就制订了今年的增产计划，并立即和全体农户一起投入兴修水利、造肥积肥等春耕准备工作。
    今年中南全区粮食总产量争取比去年提高百分之五点七，棉花总产量争取提高约百分之二十九。在不影响粮食增产的条件下，油料总产量争取提高百分之十八，茶叶总产量也将争取比去年提高百分之七。为实现这个增产计划，中共中央中南局早在二月下旬就发出春耕生产的号召，要求各地以互助合作为中心内容继续向农民深入进行总路线教育，认真办好现已建成和正在建立的农业生产合作社，作好各项春耕生产工作。目前中南各省的国家银行正在农村中大力发放农业贷款，各级供销合作社正供应农民当前所需的商品肥料、新旧农具、耕畜和种子；还组织了手工业者为农民加工和修补农具。
    另外，中南区虽然今年的春耕准备动手很早，但在春节以前因为农村中正开展宣传总路线运动，进行购粮工作，冬耕冬种作得比较粗糙，兴修水利的计划完成较差，肥料准备不足，副业生产较少。春节后，各省才先后抓紧领导农民的准备工作，突击整修了塘堰、沟渠等小型灌溉工程，增修了一批新的灌溉工程，并号召农民造肥积肥。这些工作因为各地抓得较紧，现已胜利地告一段落。
    【新华社重庆二十八日电】西南区部分地区已开始春耕。四川省泸州、内江、宜宾、涪陵、江津等专区和云南省金平、景谷等县已开始播种；其他各地最近也将陆续展开。
  中共西南区各级党委和各地人民政府都加强对春耕的领导。西南行政委员会三月十八日发出关于春耕生产工作的指示，指出做好春耕是实现今年农业增产计划的决定关键之一。四川省省、专区、县三级党政领导机关大多已抽调干部下乡，检查和领导春耕。仅涪陵专区下乡干部就有四千人。江津专区已训练好四万多名领导生产的骨干，投入春耕生产。
    西南区各地财经、交通等部门积极支援农民开展春耕生产。四川省仅据七十八个县、市供销合作社统计，在一月底已准备妥当和已向手工业者订好的农具达三百八十多万件，比去年一至四月份全省供销合作社供应农民的农具数量增加十一倍。贵州省三十七个县的供销合作社，现已储备一百多万件铁、竹、木农具，几千万斤油饼、骨粉等肥料和一部分耕牛和小猪。各地人民银行已开始发放农业贷款。西南区今年计划发放农业贷款一万二千亿元，较去年增加百分之二十。全国各大城市供应西南农民春耕生产需用的肥料、农药、农械等物资大部已运抵重庆，并正由重庆用火车、轮船、汽车等交通工具迅速向各地调运。
