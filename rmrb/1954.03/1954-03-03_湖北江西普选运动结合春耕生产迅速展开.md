    Hubei and Jiangxi Popular Election Movement Rapidly Unfolds in Combination with Spring Plowing Production

    In Hubei Province, the popular election movement has unfolded rapidly because of the resolute implementation of the general line and the close combination with production to promote production. As of February 24th, the grassroots elections have been successfully completed in areas with more than 3.8 million people in the province, and the election work is about to be completed in areas with another 4.3 million people.

    The grassroots election work in various parts of Hubei Province is closely linked with production and the promotion of the general line. Many townships have formulated specific plans, requiring that not only should attention be paid to resolving the contradiction between popular elections and production, but also that popular elections should become a driving force for promoting production. Some places have already set off a wave of developing mutual aid and cooperation and stepping up production during the election process. Before the start of the popular election work in Xujin Township, Shishou County, production was first inspected; after the popular election was launched, the great significance of popular elections was promoted in conjunction with the general line, which universally improved the awareness of the people. Ninety-three percent of the voters in the township participated in the voting and elected outstanding people's representatives. At the end of the election, the peasants also newly organized 14 mutual aid teams, dug 22 large and small ditches, accumulated more than 3,200 dan of fertilizer, and cultivated nearly 200 mu of sloping fields. In Zhuqiao Township, Huangmei County, farmers have improved their socialist consciousness in the popular election movement, and 304 farmers have organized 71 permanent mutual aid teams, and 115 farmers have organized 30 temporary mutual aid teams; at the same time, the credit cooperative increased by more than 700 shares, and the supply and marketing cooperative also increased by 172 shares. In Xiannv Township, Xishui County, farmers put forward the slogan "Welcome the popular election with practical actions to repair water conservancy" during the popular election, and completed the large dam, which was originally planned to be completed in nine days, in five days.

    In many areas, as soon as the election was over, the people's representatives discussed and formulated the township's production plan based on the proposals of the masses. The production plan of Maqiao Township, Xishui County, mentioned that 35 ponds under construction should be repaired immediately, and two new small dams and a section of the lake shore should be built; it is required that each mu of land accumulate 160 dan of fertilizer; it is also planned that 80% of the farmers should be organized this year. These plans have been warmly supported by the farmers in the township.

    After convening an election work conference in January, Jiangxi Province has rapidly launched grassroots elections in more than 6,000 townships. Among them, 569 townships have been completed recently. In addition, voters in more than 700 townships are happily welcoming the arrival of the election day.

    After studying the general line, the broad masses of voters love the people's democratic regime even more and actively participate in the election. In many townships that have completed the election, more than 90% of the voters in the township participated in the voting. In order to elect outstanding "socialist pathfinders", they had several careful discussions when nominating candidates. In some townships in Poyang, Zixi and other counties, when discussing candidates, voters found that some individuals who did not work hard in production and were unwilling to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement became representative candidates, and the voters expressed their opinions and disagreed with such people as their representative candidates. Many agricultural production cooperative directors, mutual aid team leaders, and agricultural labor models who actively took the lead in participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement were supported by the broad masses of voters and were gloriously elected as people's representatives.

    The grassroots election work in various parts of Jiangxi Province is carried out around the current spring plowing production and mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas. When carrying out the popular election work, various places also conducted propaganda and education to the masses on developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations and preparing for spring plowing production, which universally improved the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of farmers. Farmers in Zhangchen Township, Yongxiu County, proposed the slogan of welcoming the popular election by doing a good job in production, and the farmers in the township widely launched preparations for spring plowing such as building water conservancy, turning fields, and accumulating fertilizer. In Yangfeng Township, Duchang County, 35 farmers voluntarily organized four mutual aid teams as a gift to welcome the popular election. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北江西普选运动结合春耕生产迅速展开
    湖北省在普选运动中，由于坚决贯彻了继续宣传总路线，紧密结合生产、推动生产的方针，使运动迅速地展开。截至二月二十四日，全省已有三百八十多万人口的地区胜利结束基层选举，另有四百三十万人口的地区也即将完成选举工作。
    湖北省各地的基层选举工作，都是和生产以及总路线的宣传密切结合进行的。很多乡都订出了具体的计划，要求不但要注意解决普选和生产的矛盾，而且使普选成为推动生产的动力。有些地方在选举过程中，已掀起了发展互助合作和加紧生产的热潮。石首县徐金乡在普选工作开始前，首先检查了生产；普选展开以后，又结合总路线宣传了普选的伟大意义，使人民群众的觉悟普遍提高。全乡有百分之九十三的选民参加了投票，选出了优秀的人民代表。选举结束时，农民们还新组织了十四个互助组，挖了大小沟渠二十二条，积了三千二百多担肥，耕了近二百亩坂田。黄梅县朱桥乡农民在普选运动中，由于提高了社会主义觉悟，有三百零四户农民组织了七十一个常年互助组，一百一十五户农民组织了三十个临时互助组；同时，信贷合作社增加了七百多股，供销合作社也增加了一百七十二股。浠水县仙女乡农民在普选中提出了“要以修好水利的实际行动迎接普选”的口号，五天时间便修好了原计划九天修成的大堤。
    很多地区选举刚结束，人民代表们就根据群众提案，讨论订出了全乡的生产计划。浠水县麻桥乡的生产计划中提到要立即修好正在动工的三十五口塘，还要再新修两个小闸，一段湖岸；要求每亩田积一百六十担肥；还计划今年要有百分之八十的农户组织起来。这些计划得到全乡农民的热烈拥护。

    江西省在一月间召开选举工作会议以后，已在六千多个乡镇迅速展开了基层选举。其中有五百六十九个乡镇已在最近完成。另外七百多个乡镇的选民正在欢欣地迎接选举日的到来。
    广大选民在学习总路线以后，更加热爱人民民主政权，热烈参加选举。许多已经完成了选举的乡镇，百分之九十以上的在乡选民参加了投票。他们为了选出优秀的“社会主义带路人”，在提出候选人时都作了几次慎重的讨论。鄱阳、资溪等县有些乡的选民在讨论候选人时，发现有个别不努力生产也不愿参加互助合作运动的人当了代表候选人，选民们纷纷提出意见，不同意这样的人做他们的代表候选人。有许多积极带头参加互助合作运动的农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长和农业劳动模范都受到广大选民的拥护，光荣地当选为人民代表。
    江西省各地的基层选举工作都是环绕着当前农村中的春耕生产和互助合作运动进行的。各地在进行普选工作时，同时向群众进行了发展互助合作组织和做好春耕生产准备工作的宣传和教育，使农民的政治积极性和劳动热情普遍提高。永修县张陈乡的农民提出要以搞好生产来迎接普选的口号，全乡农民广泛地展开了兴修水利、翻田、积肥等准备春耕的工作。都昌县阳峰乡有三十五户农民自动组织了四个互助组作为迎接普选的献礼。（新华社）
