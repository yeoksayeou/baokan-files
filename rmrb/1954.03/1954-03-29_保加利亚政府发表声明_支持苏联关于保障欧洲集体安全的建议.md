    Bulgarian Government Issues Statement
    Supporting Soviet Proposals on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe
    [Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 28] TASS reports from Sofia: On March 26, the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria issued a statement to the press on the issue of guaranteeing collective security in Europe.
    The statement said: The results of the Berlin Conference show that outstanding international issues can be resolved through consultation. The Bulgarian people are pleased to note that agreements have been reached on certain issues at this conference.
    The Berlin Conference shows that it is possible to resolve the German question and the issue of European security related to the German question, so as to further ease tensions. This is particularly necessary given the increasingly rampant resurgence of militarist and revanchist elements in West Germany, which could once again threaten peace in Europe and the world.
    The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria expresses the peace-loving aspirations of the Bulgarian people, and has always supported and will continue to support all measures aimed at eliminating the danger of the revival of West German militarism and revanchism. It firmly believes that the Soviet government's proposal for an “All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe” is in line with the national interests of the peoples of Europe. If this proposal is accepted, the danger inherent in the formation of a bloc of countries in Europe to oppose the policies of other countries will be eliminated at the same time.
    The statement pointed out: The Bulgarian people need lasting peace to continue to devote their full efforts to building socialism. Bulgaria's foreign policy is also subordinate to these tasks, and this foreign policy is entirely peaceful, determined by the fundamental nature of our people's democratic system.
    The Bulgarian people have suffered the disasters of several wars promoted by the policy of forming aggressive blocs of states. Bulgaria has twice been subjected to the aggression of German militarism, and therefore, is very concerned today about resolving the German question as soon as possible through the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Concluding the “All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe” is a decisive step in completing this important task, and it is also a decisive step in easing international tensions by establishing lasting peace and friendly relations between the peoples of Europe and the peoples of the world.
    The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria believes that if the Balkan countries and other European countries participate in the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe," it will play a decisive role in guaranteeing peace and security in the Balkans.
    The statement concluded: The Bulgarian people and the Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria unconditionally support the Soviet government's proposal for concluding the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe." The Government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria will do everything possible to support the realization of this proposal and will gladly participate in this treaty.

    保加利亚政府发表声明
    支持苏联关于保障欧洲集体安全的建议
   【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：三月二十六日，保加利亚人民共和国政府就保障欧洲集体安全问题向报界发表声明。
    声明说：柏林会议的结果说明：通过协商能够解决悬而未决的国际问题。保加利亚人民满意地注意到在这个会议上已就某些问题达成协议。
    柏林会议表明有可能解决德国问题以及与德国问题有关的欧洲安全问题，以促使紧张局势得到进一步的缓和。鉴于西德的军国主义与复仇主义分子正日益猖獗地抬头，并且可能再次威胁欧洲和全世界和平，这一点就特别必要。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府表达保加利亚人民爱好和平的愿望，一向支持，而且将来仍然支持其目的在消除西德军国主义与复仇主义复活的危险的一切措施。它深信苏联政府关于“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议是和欧洲各国人民的民族利益一致的。如果接纳这个建议，在欧洲成立一个国家集团来反对其他国家的政策所蕴藏的危险就会同时消除。
    声明指出：保加利亚人民需要持久和平来继续尽全力建设社会主义。保加利亚的外交政策也是服从于这些任务的，这种外交政策完全是和平的，是我国人民民主制度的根本性质所决定的。
    保加利亚人民已经受过由成立侵略性的国家集团的政策所促成的几次战争的灾害。保加利亚曾经两度受侵略性的德国军国主义的束缚，因此，今天非常关心通过建立一个统一、民主与爱好和平的德国来尽早解决德国问题。而缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”，就是完成这项重要工作的决定性步骤，也是通过建立持久和平及欧洲各国人民以及世界各国人民之间的事务关系来缓和国际紧张局势的决定性步骤。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府认为，如果巴尔干国家和欧洲其他国家一道参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”，那就会在保障巴尔干的和平与安全方面发挥决定性的作用。
    声明最后说：保加利亚人民和保加利亚人民共和国政府无条件地支持苏联政府关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。保加利亚人民共和国政府将竭尽一切可能来支持这个建议的实现，并且欣然参加这个条约。
