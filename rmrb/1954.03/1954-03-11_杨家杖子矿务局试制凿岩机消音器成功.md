    Yangjiagouzi Mining Bureau Successfully Trial-Produces Rock Drill Silencer
    The Yangjiagouzi Mining Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has successfully trial-produced a rock drill silencer. Rock drills used in general mines emit a lot of noise during excavation operations, which not only damages workers' hearing but also greatly hinders the safety of the work place. In order to solve this problem, the Safety Technology Section of the Yangjiagouzi Mining Bureau conducted special research. Zheng Hongye was responsible for designing the silencer, which has now been successfully trial-produced. This silencer has a total of seven sections (three thick and four thin). A sound baffle is installed inside the thick sections. When in use, it is connected to the exhaust port of the rock drill with a seven-meter-long air hose.
    Experiments have proved that this silencer has the following advantages: First, rock drill workers generally suffer from hearing loss after three years of work due to frequent vibrations of the eardrum, and the brain nerves become dull due to frequent noise interference. After installing a silencer on the rock drill, the working environment can be much quieter. Sun Rongshan, a rock drill worker who participated in the experiment, said: "I have been drilling for eleven years, and my ears are deaf; now I am not afraid with the silencer." Second, during wet rock drilling, mist-like lubricating oil is often sprayed from the exhaust port of the rock drill, and workers' health is also damaged by inhaling this oil vapor. After installing the silencer, the oil vapor can be discharged to other locations. Third, in the past, the noise was very loud during operations, which hindered the communication between the mechanic and the assistant. After installing the silencer, communication can be strengthened, creating conditions for technical research. Fourth, during mining operations, rock falls often occur due to developed rock joints or loose rocks caused by mining blasting. In the past, it was difficult to prevent them due to the loud noise during operations, which often caused personal accidents. After installing the silencer, the sound of falling gravel or the roof can be heard, which can avoid casualties. Fifth, in the past, rock drill workers often injected lubricating oil from the exhaust port of the rock drill in order to save trouble. This made it difficult to inject the oil into the internal parts of the machine, and most of the oil was carried out by the exhaust gas from the exhaust port. After installing the silencer, the exhaust port is connected to the silencer, which requires oil to be injected from the oil injection hole. (Wang Shiyong)

    杨家杖子矿务局试制凿岩机消音器成功
    重工业部杨家杖子矿务局试制凿岩机消音器成功。一般矿山使用的凿岩机，在采掘作业中发出很大的躁音，不但损害工人的听觉，对作业场所的安全也有很大的妨碍。为解决这个问题，杨家杖子矿务局安全技术科进行了专门的研究，由郑洪业负责设计消音器，已试制成功。这种消音器全部共七节（粗三，细四），粗节内安挡音板一块，使用时，用七公尺长的风绳把它和凿岩机的排气孔连接起来。
    经实验证明，这种消音器有以下几个好处：一、一般凿岩工人工作三年以后，因耳膜经常受到震动而犯重听症，脑神经因经常受躁音干扰而引起感觉迟钝现象。在凿岩机上安装消音器后，可使作业环境清静很多。参加试验的凿岩机工人孙荣山说：“我打了十一年眼啦，耳朵都震聋了；现在有了消音器就不怕了。”二、在湿式凿岩时，经常有雾状的润滑油从凿岩机排气口喷出，工人吸入这种油气，也损害身体健康。安装消音器后，可将油气排到其他地点。三、过去在作业中躁音很大，妨碍机工与助工的联系。安装消音器后，可加强联系，为研究技术创造了条件。四、在采矿作业时由于岩石节理发达或因采矿放炮后所造成的松石，往往发生落盘事故，过去因作业时躁音很大，不易预防，时常造成人身事故。安上消音器后，能听见落碎石或顶板发出的声音，可以避免伤亡事故。五、过去凿岩工人为了省事，往往从凿岩机的排气孔内注入润滑油，这样就不容易把油注入机体内部各机件上去，绝大部分的油又由排气孔被废气带出。安上消音器后，排气孔与消音器连接一起，这就必须从注油孔注油了。（王世镛）
