    Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Speeds Up Production Preparation Work
    Full Trial Production to Begin After July This Year

    The state-owned Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, China's first modern tool manufacturing plant currently under construction, is set to begin full trial production this year. It is now accelerating its various production preparation efforts.

    With the rapid progress of large-scale winter construction, the equipment installation projects in the plant's tool workshop and repair workshop were completed two months ahead of schedule in December last year. Trial production began in January this year, and it has already been officially put into production. A large-scale heat treatment workshop closely coordinating with the production of these two workshops is now installing various complex new machines and equipment. In the cutting tool workshop, which was completed before the Lunar New Year, seven main production workshops will have all equipment installed completely in March and April this year and will begin trial production of new products.

    Before the official commissioning of each production workshop, production preparation is an arduous and complex process. Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all employees, the plant had translated and replicated the data and drawings of the cutting tool section before November last year and has seized the preparation of technical operating procedures, production organization design, and tool and fixture drawings. In order to enable production technicians to quickly understand advanced technology and production characteristics, after the translation of various data, relevant technicians, workshop directors, and construction workers were organized to study in professional groups.

    At present, various young skilled workers, cultivated on behalf of the plant by tool factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Dalian, Qiqihar, and this city, have arrived at the plant in a steady stream. In order to enable these young skilled workers from all over the country to quickly become familiar with machine performance and the production process, the plant held a short-term training course for them to practice. Now, these technicians are about to be assigned to various workshops to operate new machines and begin production. In addition, the plant's technical school is training various technical talents, and the first batch of more than 300 people will be able to participate in production this year. The trainees who were sent to the Soviet Union for internships will also be able to return home soon.

    The civil engineering construction project of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant can be completed half a year ahead of schedule according to China's first five-year plan and put into production. According to the new plan, the entire factory will begin full trial production after July this year.

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂加紧进行生产准备工作
    今年七月份后将全部试车投入生产
    正在兴建中的我国第一座近代化的工具制造厂——国营哈尔滨量具刃具厂，今年内要全部试车投入生产，现正加速进行各项生产准备工作。
    随着大规模冬季施工的迅速进展，该厂工具车间和修配车间的设备安装工程，已提前两个月于去年十二月全部完工，今年一月份进行试车，并已正式投入生产。密切配合这两个车间进行生产的一座规模庞大的热处理车间，现正安装各种复杂的新式机器设备。在年前已建成的刃具车间里有七个主要生产车间，都要在今年三、四月份安装完全部设备，开始试制新产品。
    在各个生产车间正式投入生产以前，生产准备是一项繁重而复杂的工作过程。该厂在苏联专家热情的指导和全体职工的积极努力下，已在年前十一月间，翻译和复制了刃具部分的资料和图纸，并抓紧了技术操作规程、生产组织设计和工具、卡具图纸等准备工作。为了使生产技职人员迅速了解先进技术和生产特点，各种资料翻译出来后，就组织了有关技术人员、车间主任和施工员等，按各个专业小组进行学习。
    目前，由上海、天津、大连、齐齐哈尔和本市各工具厂代为培养的各种青年技术工人，已源源抵达该厂。为了使这批来自全国各地的青年技术工人们迅速地熟悉机器性能、生产过程，该厂曾举办了一个短期训练班，让他们实习。现在，这些技术人员将要分配到各个车间去，操纵着新式的机器开始生产。此外，该厂的技工学校正在培养着各种技术人材，第一批三百余人在今年内就可参加生产。被派往苏联实习的学员们，不久也可以回国。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂的土木建筑工程，按照我国第一个五年计划，可提前半年竣工，并投入生产。按照新的计划，整个工厂将在今年七月份以后，全部试车投入生产。
