Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 10th: Newspapers have published a statement from the Government of the Polish People's Republic.

The statement said: The Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that the Berlin Conference is of great significance because, having learned from historical lessons, the Polish People's Republic is deeply concerned about fundamentally easing international tensions and peacefully resolving disputes, especially European disputes.

The results of the Berlin Conference show that, despite differences between countries, it is possible to reach agreements on disputed issues. The Berlin Conference also proved that outstanding issues, particularly the German question and the issue of ensuring European security, can and must be further discussed.

The statement pointed out: The ruling groups in the United States and West German revanchists are trying to revive German militarism through the "European Army" treaty. Under these circumstances, the people of European countries have a special obligation to prevent further developments that directly undermine their security. The statement said: The Government of the Polish People's Republic is convinced that the Soviet proposal for an all-European treaty on ensuring collective security in Europe points out the correct path in this regard. The Polish people are very concerned about ensuring European security because the aggressive intentions of German militarism are primarily directed against Poland.

The statement continued: The Government of the Polish People's Republic believes that the best way to ensure peace in Europe is to establish a collective security system, and therefore, it fully supports the Soviet proposal for an all-European treaty on ensuring collective security in Europe. This treaty, based on respecting the independence of countries and non-interference in internal affairs, can prevent any form of aggression. This treaty guarantees that all contracting parties have an obligation to provide all possible assistance, including the use of military force, to a contracting party that suffers aggression. For Poland, France, and other countries, this treaty means that the revanchist plans of German militarists and plans to revise borders will lose their foundation. Such a treaty can end the policies that endanger peace and divide Europe into mutually opposed blocs of countries, and can save European countries from the dangers inherent in the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, which the United States is stepping up its promotion of. At the same time, this treaty lays the foundation for establishing a unified, democratic Germany in order to peacefully resolve the German question. The basic principles of the aforementioned treaty should be the subject of specific consultations and negotiations among European countries.

The statement continued: Based on the principles of a peaceful foreign policy of peaceful cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, the Government of the Polish People's Republic supports the Soviet proposal for an all-European treaty on ensuring collective security in Europe. Poland's western border, the Oder and Neisse Rivers, is an important factor in ensuring European security. Its treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and other Eastern and Southern European countries to prevent aggression by German militarism and the forces colluding with it contribute to ensuring peace and are in line with the principles of collective security. The Polish People's Republic's stance of defending peace is reflected in its unremitting efforts in the United Nations for the benefit of collective security, its call at the end of last year for the governments of Germany's neighboring countries to take joint action to prevent threats to the cause of peace, and its continuous efforts to expand international economic exchanges. The statement concluded by emphasizing: The Government of the Polish People's Republic consistently pursues a policy of peace, is ready to participate in an all-European treaty on ensuring collective security in Europe, and is ready to take joint action with all European countries to ensure that this treaty is concluded and implemented.

    波兰人民共和国政府发表声明
    支持苏联提出的关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案
    【新华社十一日讯】　据塔斯社华沙十日讯：各报刊载了波兰人民共和国政府的声明。
    声明说：波兰人民共和国政府认为柏林会议具有重大的意义，因为波兰人民共和国经受过历史教训，深切关怀根本缓和国际紧张局势以及和平解决争执问题，特别是欧洲的争执问题。
    柏林会议的结果表明：尽管国与国之间存在着分歧，但是对争执问题达成协议是有可能的。柏林会议也证明：能够而且必须进一步讨论悬而未决的问题，特别是德国问题和保障欧洲安全的问题。
    声明指出：美国统治集团和西德复仇主义者正在设法通过“欧洲军”条约复活德国军国主义。在这种情况下，欧洲各国人民负有特别的义务来防止直接破坏他们安全的事件的进一步发展。声明说：波兰人民共和国政府深信：苏联提出的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案在这方面指出了正确的道路。波兰人民非常关心保障欧洲安全，因为德国军国主义的侵略意图首先就对着波兰。
    声明接着说：波兰人民共和国政府认为：保障欧洲和平的最好的办法，就是建立集体安全体系，因此，它完全拥护苏联提出的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案。以尊重各国的独立和不干涉别国内政为基础的这个条约，可以阻止任何一种侵略。这个条约保证：一切缔约国有义务对遭受侵略的某一缔约国给予一切可能的援助，包括使用军队在内。对波兰、法国及其他国家说来，这个条约就意味着德国军国主义者的复仇计划和修改边界的计划会丧失其基础。这样一个条约可以结束危害和平并且使欧洲分裂为互相对立的国家集团的政策，可以使欧洲国家免受美国加紧促成的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约中所蕴藏的危险。同时，这个条约还为建立一个统一、民主的德国以便和平解决德国问题打下基础。上述条约的基本原则应该是欧洲各国具体协商和谈判的对象。
    声明继续说：波兰人民共和国政府根据在平等和互相尊重主权的基础上和所有国家和平合作的和平外交政策的原则，支持苏联关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案。波兰西部的边界奥得河和尼斯河是保障欧洲安全的重要因素。它和苏联及其他东欧和南欧国家缔结的防止德国军国主义及与它勾结的势力的侵略的友好互助条约，有助于保障和平，符合于集体安全的原则。波兰人民共和国保卫和平的立场表现在：它在联合国中为集体安全的利益而努力不懈，去年年底又呼吁德国邻国的政府共同行动以防止对和平事业的威胁，并且不断努力扩大国际经济交流。声明最后强调：波兰人民共和国政府始终不渝地奉行和平政策，准备参加保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，并且准备和所有欧洲国家采取共同行动，使这个条约得以缔结和实现。
