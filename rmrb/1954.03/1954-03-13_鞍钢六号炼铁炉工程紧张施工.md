One of the Anshan Iron and Steel's reconstruction projects this year, the No. 6 blast furnace, began construction at the end of last year. Currently, the demolition of the main parts of the blast furnace has been completed, and work such as deepening and reinforcing the furnace bottom and raising the top of the hot blast stove is underway. Scaffolders and riveters on the top of the heating furnace have begun to raise the top of the hot blast stove, and one stove top has been basically completed (a total of three stove tops are being raised). The workers responsible for demolishing the old furnace lining on the furnace body completed this task as early as mid-February, and they are now working tensely and happily to dismantle the cold materials (pig iron blocks) left in the furnace in the past. They guarantee to remove all the thousands of tons of cold material by mid-March. The workers in the hoist room in the air are also busy inspecting the pulleys, preparing to install copper sleeves, and some people are reinforcing the fifteen-ton crane frame and installing supports in the hoist room. The workers in the combustion section are currently carrying out the installation of heaters, ventilators, and No. 9 dust collectors. The workers who are deepening and reinforcing the furnace bottom are proceeding according to the design plan. In the circular face-centered area at the bottom of the blast furnace, the design requirements have been met, and this work will soon be completed.

    鞍钢六号炼铁炉工程紧张施工
    鞍钢今年改建工程之一的第六号炼铁炉，从去年年底开始施工，目前，炼铁炉主要部分的拆除工作已经完成，正进行炉底加深加固、加高热风炉炉顶等项工程。在加热炉炉顶上的架工和铆工们，已开始加高热风炉炉顶工作，有一座炉顶已经基本完成（共加高三个热风炉顶）。担负拆除炉体上旧炉坯的工人们，早于二月中旬就完成了这项工作，他们正紧张而愉快地拆除过去炉内遗留下的冷料（生铁块），他们保证在三月中旬把千余吨的冷料全部拆除掉。高空中的卷扬机室里的工人，也正忙碌着检修绳轮，准备镶铜套，并且有一部分人在加固卷扬机室十五吨吊车车架和安装支柱。燃涤部分的工人们，目前正进行加热器、通风机、九号除尘器等项的安装工作。在做加深加固炉底工作的工人们，正在按照设计计划进行着。在高炉底层的圆型面心的地方，已经达到了设计要求的标准，不久这项工作即将完成。
