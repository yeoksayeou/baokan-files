How to Develop Scientific Research in Universities
Beijing University Library Director Xiang Da

Regarding the issue of how to develop scientific research in universities, some comrades have already published articles that explain the problem very clearly. I only want to discuss a few more specific aspects.

There are two indispensable factors in engaging in scientific research: one is the people who engage in scientific research, and the other is the necessary equipment for scientific research, such as books and instruments. The most important of the two is still people. Without people, even with perfect equipment, scientific research will never naturally emerge. Of course, equipment is also important, but it does not play as decisive a role as the human factor, because equipment is ultimately prepared by people. With the right people, you can "turn the impossible into the possible," but without the right people, even good equipment is useless.

Due to historical reasons, we are very lacking in both people and equipment in scientific research. There are too few people in the country who can engage in scientific research, and the books and instruments necessary for developing scientific research lack a systematic approach, with some things missing and others present. But we still have some foundation; in some scientific departments, we even have relatively good foundations and achievements. The reason why the development of scientific research in universities still has some problems today is not that we have no strength at all, but that we have not been able to organize, maintain, and develop the original strength, thus forming a phenomenon of fighting individually and going our own way. I am not very clear about the situation in natural sciences, but it is very prominent in the historical science department of social sciences. The following will explain my opinions from the aspects of people and equipment, and the examples cited are still limited to the departments I know.

I. We should organize manpower well

About two-thirds or more of the people in the country who can engage in scientific research are concentrated in universities. Therefore, in developing scientific research, universities should shoulder a considerable responsibility and play a considerable role: on the one hand, cultivating and transporting cadres for various construction departments, and on the other hand, cooperating closely with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, coordinating with the scientific research plans of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and cultivating and supplementing cadres for it. For universities themselves, teaching and scientific research should complement each other, not contradict each other. However, since the adjustment of departments in 1952, universities have almost put all available manpower into teaching reform. Especially in the early stages after the department adjustments, some people worked more than 70 hours a week to deal with writing textbooks and classroom teaching. In addition to preparing lessons, there was no energy left to attend to scientific research. Teaching and scientific research should not have been contradictory, but now they are. And in terms of teaching, if the work of textbook construction can be done well, it can really solve the difficulties in teaching. In fact, even this point cannot be solved. There are several reasons why it cannot be solved: First, the lecture notes written this year, even the original writer himself dares not believe them next year and must revise them; second, the lecture notes written are often only lectured by the original writer, and another person cannot cope; third, the lecture notes written can only be used for internal reference, and once they are submitted, other schools have opinions and cannot obtain unanimous or at least partial agreement from outside the school. Therefore, every year is busy with lecture notes, and everyone is busy with lecture notes. In addition, some teaching and research sections, although they have been established, seem like a collective, but in reality they are "collective individual work." Within a teaching and research section, teachers are engaged in "collective individual work" with each other, and schools go their own way, without contact with each other, and are also engaged in "collective individual work." As a result, each school engages in its own set, but cannot take it out, and when it is taken out, there are many opinions. Teachers spend all their time preparing lessons, and there is no time to take care of the preparation of specialized courses in the five-year system, let alone engage in scientific research or improve the quality of teaching.

Therefore, to develop scientific research in universities today, the first thing to do is to formulate some systems to use manpower more rationally, so that some teachers who can engage in scientific research can be freed from administrative affairs as much as possible, so that they can have the conditions to develop scientific research. Teaching and scientific research are not contradictory in the first place. Broadly speaking, teaching, especially teaching reform, should also be regarded as part of scientific research. However, this does not mean that teaching is equal to scientific research. The roles of the two complement each other rather than being equal. Today, it is entirely necessary to free up some manpower so that it can initially develop scientific research. How to free up some manpower? Mr. Jian Bozan has made some suggestions in his article (see page 3 of the February 10th People's Daily), and these suggestions are all good. In addition, I think we should also do a good job of organization and unity, and organize and unite the strength, which must be better than the effect of "collective individual work." Now let's take the historical science as an example to talk about it.

In the past, historical teaching in universities was fought separately, each going its own way. There was a period when one school was used as a key experiment to produce a set of outlines for other schools to refer to. First of all, other schools had opinions on this set of outlines, and secondly, each school wrote its own teaching materials according to the outlines, forming different opinions and inconsistent opinions. As a result, as mentioned above, it did not solve the problem of historical teaching in general universities. Recently, I heard that for the historical teaching of comprehensive universities, it is planned to entrust three schools to do key experiments, which is better than the previous "isolated point" method. I think that when talking about key points today, the foundation of the points should be broader and have the nature of a small-scale surface, and then the results of the experiment can be more stable. Taking the historical teaching of comprehensive universities as an example, if one of the three schools doing key experiments is the history department of Peking University, can the history department of Peking University be used as the center, and then the history department of Nankai University in Tianjin be organized together to jointly solve the problem of historical teaching? Or can the historical courses be divided into paragraphs or topics, and the two schools separately identify the writing of teaching materials? In this way, on the one hand, some manpower can be freed up, and on the other hand, the compiled teaching materials can at least solve the difficulties in two places and two schools at the same time.

Organize and unite available manpower to jointly solve urgent problems in teaching, and then it is possible to free up some manpower. With manpower, we can be regarded as having the prerequisites for developing scientific research. If universities have the conditions to develop scientific research, it will naturally be possible to improve the quality of teaching, the specifications for cadre training, and the development and cadre supplementation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' scientific research work.

This kind of organization and unity work is best initiated from top to bottom, and then it will be more convenient to implement and reduce unnecessary concerns. For example, if the Central Ministry of Higher Education can effectively give instructions to each school, it will be more effective and justifiable than the automatic organization of each school.

Being able to free up manpower and having the conditions for developing scientific research, the next step is to formally develop scientific research, we must arrange specific work according to the needs of the country, in connection with their own strength, and in cooperation with the plans of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. At this stage, we should communicate with each other from top to bottom, carry out criticism and self-criticism in academics, and establish a free discussion atmosphere. General academic groups such as various scientific societies should play a considerable role.

The above is my opinion on organizing manpower. In summary, it is to reverse the past tendency of "collective individual work", several locations and several schools should be organized according to the course, and the strength of a truly collective to solve teaching problems, so that it is possible to free up manpower, and first create conditions for developing scientific research.

II. The importance of teaching and scientific research should be put first in universities, giving full play to potential and supplementing equipment as much as possible

Regarding our past scientific research work, the equipment is also insufficient as the manpower: the number of laboratory equipment is insufficient, and some are too old. The purchase of books is not systematic. The important books and magazines necessary for scientific research, as well as the classic works in science, we have not purchased systematically in the past, but only bought them intermittently. Therefore, it is often difficult to do scientific research. But we still have them in the end, as long as we can use them rationally and give full play to potential strength, we can initially supply them for scientific research use at present. It is strange that there are some unreasonable phenomena and incorrect understandings, so that the original insufficient equipment cannot be fully utilized.

For example, our instrument equipment is very insufficient. However, the working hours of some schools stipulate that classes are only held in the morning. When the class time is concentrated, each subject and class use the laboratory at the same time, so the instruments are naturally insufficient, and the general use between departments is greatly restricted. If it is changed to two shifts of classes in the morning and afternoon, or with the addition of the evening, three shifts of classes, then the utilization rate of a set of instruments can be increased to two or three times. This is very helpful for improving teaching efficiency and creating conditions for developing scientific research. Why don't we do it? Speaking of books, the situation is the same as instruments. Some schools have problems with the capacity of the library, and cannot build new libraries or expand new stacks, so they have to stack most of the books and disperse them in various places, so that they cannot be concentrated, which reduces the utilization rate of books and increases the trouble of borrowing books. Because there is a problem with the capacity of the library, and there are not enough reading seats, students or teachers have difficulty reading and borrowing books, which affects students' learning on the one hand and the development of scientific research on the other hand.

The above are the unreasonable phenomena, and there is also an incorrect understanding. Today's universities should focus on teaching (including scientific research). The school budget should first meet the needs of teaching and scientific research, and then other needs. However, some schools have the opposite view. When making a budget, they first allocate and fix the funds for non-teaching purposes, and then allocate the remaining money to teaching. The funds for necessary equipment and book purchases for teaching are not enough, and can only be reduced by themselves, and cannot use a single cent under the non-teaching items. All of this is unreasonable, and will naturally bring considerable harm to teaching and scientific research.

Our equipment is insufficient. However, if we can put teaching and scientific research first in universities, give full play to potential strength, and gradually supplement equipment as much as possible, then improving teaching quality and developing scientific research will certainly not be a problem.

The above discusses the issue of developing scientific research in universities from the aspects of people and equipment. The points mentioned are based on personal perceptions, without in-depth investigation and research, and without detailed analysis, so they are very immature.

    如何展开高等学校的科学研究工作北京大学图书馆馆长　向　达
    关于如何在高等学校展开科学研究工作的问题，有些同志已发表过文章，把问题讲得很清楚了。我只想就几个比较具体的方面来谈一谈。
    从事科学研究工作，有两个因素是不能缺少的，一个是从事科学研究工作的人，一个是从事科学研究工作所必要的设备如图书仪器之类。二者之中最重要的还是人。没有人，光有完善的设备，绝不会自然长出科学研究来的。当然，设备也是重要的，不过不像人的因素那样起决定性的作用，因为设备究竟是由人置备起来的，得其人可以“化腐朽为神奇”，不得其人则虽有好设备也是无用。
    由于历史的原因，我们在科学研究工作方面，无论是人或设备都是很不够的。全国能够从事科学研究工作的人太少了，为展开科学研究工作所必要的图书和仪器设备也缺乏系统，有这缺那。但是我们还是有，并不是毫无基础；有些科学部门，我们还有比较好的基础和成绩。今天高等学校的科学研究工作的展开之所以还有一些问题，其原因并不是我们根本没有力量，而是我们没有能把原有的一点力量好好组织起来，保养发展起来，因而形成一种各自为战、各奔前程的现象。自然科学方面的情况我不太清楚，最少在社会科学中的历史科学部门显现得很突出。以下就人同设备两方面来说明我的意见，所举的例子仍然限于我所知道的部门。
    一、应该把人力好好地组织
        起来
    全国能够从事科学研究的人，大约有三分之二以上集中在高等学校，所以在展开科学研究工作中，高等学校应该担负起相当大的责任，起相当大的作用：一方面为各建设部门培养和输送干部，一方面和中国科学院密切合作，配合中国科学院的科学研究计划协同工作，并为之培养和补充干部。就高等学校的本身来讲，教学工作和科学研究工作应该是相得益彰，而不是彼此矛盾。但从一九五二年院系调整以来，高等学校几乎把全部可用的人力都投到教学改革方面去了。尤其是在院系刚刚调整以后的一个阶段，有些人每周竟工作到七十小时以上，来对付编写教材和课堂教学。除了备课以外，更无余力顾到科学研究工作。教学工作和科学研究工作本来不应该有矛盾的，如今竟然有了矛盾了。而在教学方面如其教材建设的工作能够作好，真可以解决教学上的困难那也罢了。实际上连这一点也不能解决。其不能解决的原因有几方面：一、今年写的讲稿，到明年原写稿人自己也不敢相信，非改不可；二、所写的讲稿往往只有原写稿人来讲，换一个人就应付不了；三、所写讲稿，只能内部参考，一提出去，其他学校就有意见，得不到一致的、或至少校外一部分人的同意。因此年年忙于讲稿，人人忙于讲稿。此外，有些教研室，虽说已成立起来，好像
  一个集体，但实际却是“集体单干”。在一个教研室内，教员彼此之间在搞“集体单干”，校和校之间各行其是，不相联系，也在那里搞“集体单干”。结果每一个学校自搞一套，却拿不出去，拿出去了也是意见纷纷。教员所有的时间都花在备课上面，五年制中专门化课程的准备问题尚且无暇顾及，自然谈不到从事科学研究工作，也谈不到提高教学质量。
    所以今天在高等学校展开科学研究工作，首先是要制定一些制度，更合理地使用人力，使有些可以从事科学研究工作的教师尽可能从行政事务中解脱出来，使其能有条件来展开科学研究工作。教学工作和科学研究工作本来是没有矛盾的，从广义看，教学工作，尤其是教学改革工作，也应作为科学研究工作的一部分。但是这并不能说教学工作就等于科学研究工作，两者的作用是彼此相成而不是彼此相等。今天解脱一部分人力使其能初步展开科学研究工作，完全是有必要的。如何来解脱一部分人力呢？关于这一点，翦伯赞先生的文章（见二月十日人民日报三版）里曾有所建议，这些建议都是好的。此外我以为还应当好好地作一番组织和团结工作，把力量组织起来、团结起来，这比“集体单干”的效果一定要来得好。兹以历史科学一门为例来说一说。
    过去高等学校的历史教学是各自为战、各奔前程。有过一个时期，以一个学校为重点试验，作出一套大纲，提供各校作参考。首先这一套大纲，其他学校就有意见，其次各校根据大纲自写教材，形成了人各异说，莫衷一是。结果就像上面所说，并没有解决一般高等学校历史教学的问题。最近听说关于综合大学的历史教学，打算委托三个学校作重点试验，这比以前的“孤点”办法是好一点了。我觉得今天谈重点，点的基础要比较广大一点，兼有小规模面的性质，然后试验出来的结果才能比较稳固。就拿综合大学的历史教学来说，假设作重点试验的三个学校，其中有一个是北京大学的历史系，是不是可以以北京大学历史系为中心，再把天津的南开大学历史系组织到一起，联合两校的人力来解决历史教学的问题？或者是不是可以把历史课程按照段落或题目，两校分别认定编写教材？这样一来，一方面即可抽出一部分人力，一方面编好的教材最少可以同时解决两处地方两个学校的困难。
    把可用的人力组织起来、团结起来，共同解决教学上迫切的问题，然后有可能抽出一部分人力。有了人力，才算是具备了展开科学研究工作的先决条件。高等学校有条件展开科学研究工作，对于教学质量的提高，干部培养规格的提高，以及中国科学院科学研究工作的展开和干部的补充自然也有可能了。
    这种组织工作和团结工作，最好是从上而下的发动，然后实行起来才比较方便，减少不必要的顾虑。譬如说如其中央高等教育部能切实地向各校予以指示，这比各校之自动组织要来得有效，来得名正言顺。
    能够抽出人力，具备了展开科学研究工作的条件，下一步正式展开科学研究工作，就要按照国家的需要，联系自己的实力，配合中国科学院的计划，来布置具体的工作。到了这一阶段，上下通气，在学术上展开批评和自我批评，建立自由讨论的风气，一般的学术团体如各种科学学会，应该要起相当的作用。
    以上是我对于把人力组织起来的意见。总括起来说，即是要扭转过去“集体单干”的偏向，几个地点几个学校按照课程组织起来，用真正集体的力量，来解决教学问题，使其有可能抽出人力，首先为展开科学研究工作创造条件。二、在高等学校里应该把教学工作和科学研究工作的重要性提到第一位，充分发挥潜力，尽可能的补充设备
    关于我们过去的科学研究工作，在设备方面也同人力一样是不够的：实验室的仪器设备数量不够，有些也太旧了。图书方面的购置没有系统，从事科学研究工作必需的重要书籍和杂志，以及科学方面的经典著作，我们过去都不是有计划有系统地去购置，而只是断断续续地买来的，因此作起科学研究工作来往往感觉困难。但是我们总还是有，只要能合理的使用，充分发挥潜在的力量，在目前是能够初步供应作科学研究工作之用的。奇怪的是存在一些不合理的现象以及不正确的认识，以至原有的那一点不够的设备也不能充分利用了。
    举例来说：我们的仪器设备是很不够的。可是有些学校的作息时间规定只上午上课。上课的时间一集中，各科各班都在同一时间使用实验室，于是仪器自然就不够了，科系之间的通用也就大受限制了。若是改成上下午两班上课，或者加上晚上，三班上课，那么一套仪器的使用率就可提高到两倍或三倍。这对于提高教学效率，为展开科学研究工作创造条件，都是大有帮助的，我们为什么不做呢？说到图书，情形和仪器一样。有些学校因为图书馆的容量发生问题，不能盖新的图书馆，扩充新的书库，只好将大部分图书堆起来，分散各处，不能集中，既减低了图书的使用率，也增加了图书借阅的麻烦。因为图书馆容量有了问题，阅览座位不够，于是无论学生或者先生看书借书都发生困难，一方面影响了学生的学习，一方面也影响到科学研究工作的展开。
    以上是说的不合理的现象，此外还有一种不正确的认识。今天的高等学校应该是以教学（包括科学研究工作在内）为中心任务。学校预算应该先满足教学工作和科学研究工作的需要，然后再及其他。可是有些学校的看法刚刚相反，造预算的时候，先把非教学用的款项都分配妥当，固定下来，剩下的钱再分配到教学方面去。教学上必需的仪器设备和图书购置的经费不够，只能自行削减，不能动用非教学项下的一丝一毫。这都是不够合理的，也自然而然的会对教学工作和科学研究工作带来相当大的危害。
    我们的设备方面是不够的。可是我们如其在高等学校内能够把教学工作和科学研究工作提到第一位，充分发挥潜在力量，尽可能地逐渐补充设备，那对于教学质量的提高，科学研究工作的展开，一定是不成问题的。
    以上，就人和设备两方面来谈展开高等学校科学研究工作的问题。所举诸点，只就个人的观感所及立论，既未能作深入的调查研究，也未作细致的分析，所以是很不成熟的。
