    Fifteen New and Reconstructed State Farms in Central South China
    Hubei Province Farms Reclaim Wasteland to Expand Cultivated Area
    The Central South region is currently building, expanding, and reconstructing state-owned farms, striving to increase grain production for the country. Currently, a total of fifteen state-owned farms have been surveyed and decided upon for construction, expansion, and reconstruction in the region, which can increase the cultivated area by 500,000 mu. Together with the original 160,000 mu of cultivated land of various farms, the total area is 660,000 mu. If calculated at an annual grain yield of 300 jin per mu, it can produce approximately 200 million jin of grain for the country each year.
    The situations of expansion, reconstruction, and new establishment of state-owned farms in the Central South region this year are as follows: The Hubei Province State-Owned May 3rd Mechanized Farm will expand its operational scale by two times compared to its original size this year, and the cultivated area can reach more than 100,000 mu. The cultivated area of the expanded State-Owned Nanpingwan (Hanchuan) Farm and the State-Owned Caobuhu (Yichang) Farm will reach 48,000 mu. In addition, there are several locations in Hubei Province suitable for establishing state-owned farms, which are currently under further surveying. The Hunan Province State-Owned Datong Lake Semi-Mechanized Farm has expanded its cultivated area by more than 60,000 mu after eliminating waterlogging and reclaiming wasteland, which is more than double the original cultivated area. The Hunan Provincial People's Government has also decided to build a new State-Owned Junshan Farm with a cultivated area of more than 50,000 mu near Junshan on the north bank of Dongting Lake. Henan Province has determined to build or reconstruct two state-owned farms in Minquan County on the south bank of the Yellow River and Huai'bin County in the middle reaches of the Huai River, and is conducting surveys in Neihuang County and Zhongmu County and several other locations available for farm construction. Guangdong Province plans to build, reconstruct, and expand five state-owned farms, increasing the cultivated area by a total of 100,700 mu. Jiangxi and Guangxi provinces have also selected one or two sites each for farm construction. There are still several areas along the coast of Guangxi Province where farms can be built, and research and surveying are currently underway. It is estimated that 400,000 mu of the newly surveyed and determined cultivated land of state-owned farms in the region will be put into production successively in the first half of this year, and the rest will begin production during the autumn sowing season.
    Xinhua News Agency report:
    In other news, state-owned farms in Hubei Province are actively reclaiming wasteland and expanding cultivated areas, striving to produce more grain for the country.
    Hubei Province has a crisscross network of lakes and rivers, which is conducive to farmland irrigation, but before liberation, many fertile fields became waterlogged areas and could not be cultivated due to years of disrepair of water conservancy projects. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government led the peasants to repair dikes and build sluice gates, which not only eliminated water disasters but also created a large number of wastelands available for reclamation. According to preliminary investigations, as long as some water conservancy projects are added, the cultivable area can reach more than six million mu. Most of these lands are flat and contiguous, suitable for mechanized cultivation. After reclamation, the grain produced by these lands each year can feed three million people for a year.
    In order to make full use of the reclaimable wasteland and increase grain production for the country, in recent years, the Party and government leading organs of Hubei Province have set up many small state-owned farms in various reclaimable areas. At present, there are 110 state-owned farms in the province, which have reclaimed and planted more than 340,000 mu of land. Last year, some key farms began planned reclamation. Among them, the May 3rd Farm and the Shayang Farm plan to expand their cultivated land to more than two million mu in a few years; they have now reclaimed more than 130,000 mu of wasteland.
    In order to further reclaim wasteland in a planned and large-scale manner, relevant departments in Hubei Province are organizing forces to prepare for a comprehensive survey and conduct an accurate investigation of reclaimable wasteland and waterlogged areas. This year, it is planned to first expand the five state-owned farms of May 3rd, Shayang, Nanpingwan, Caobuhu, and Zhangduhu as a basis; each expanded farm will reclaim a total of 477,000 mu of wasteland. At present, more than 10,000 workers and civilians are working hard to build the Shilon Crossing the River and Nanpingwan and other water conservancy projects related to this year's reclamation. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hubei Provincial People's Government has ordered various agricultural machinery needed for this year's reclamation, and twenty tractors have been transported to the Shayang Farm.

### 中南区新建改建十五个国营农场  湖北省各农场开垦荒地扩大耕地面积

    中南区新建改建十五个国营农场
    湖北省各农场开垦荒地扩大耕地面积
    中南区各地正在新建、扩建和改建国营农场，争取为国家增产更多的粮食。现在全区已经经过勘测决定新建、扩建和改建的国营农场共有十五个，可增加耕地面积五十万亩；加上各农场原有的十六万亩耕地，共为六十六万亩。如以每亩年产粮三百斤计，每年可给国家生产粮食约两亿斤。
    中南区各国营农场今年要扩建、改建和新建立的情况是：湖北省国营五三机耕农场今年将比原有的经营规模扩大两倍，耕地面积可达十万亩多。国营南屏垸（汉川）农场和国营草埠湖（宜昌）农场扩建后的耕地面积，将达到四万八千亩。此外湖北省还有几处适合建立国营农场的地点，正在进一步勘测中。湖南省国营大通湖半机耕农场经过排除内涝和开荒后，扩大耕地六万多亩，比原有耕地增加二倍多。湖南省人民政府并决定在洞庭湖北岸的君山附近，新建一个耕地面积在五万亩以上的国营君山农场。河南省已确定在黄河南岸的民权县和淮河中游的淮滨县新建或改建两处国营农场，并正在内黄县和中牟县等几处可供建场地点进行勘测。广东省计划新建、改建和扩建五个国营农场，共增加耕地十万零七千多亩。江西和广西两省也已择定建场地址各一二处。广西省沿海尚有几个地区可以建场，现正进行研究和勘测中。据估计全区新勘测确定的国营农场的耕地，将有四十万亩可在今年上半年陆续投入生产，其余将在秋播时开始生产。
    又讯：湖北省各国营农场积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，争取为国家增产更多的粮食。
    湖北省湖泊、河流纵横交错，有利于农田灌溉，但在解放前因水利长年失修，使许多良田变成了渍水区，无法耕种。解放后，共产党和人民政府领导农民修堤建闸，不仅解除了水患，并出现了大批可供垦殖的荒地。据初步调查，只要加修一部分水利工程，可开拓的耕地面积就能达六百万亩以上。这些土地大多平坦成片，适宜于使用机器耕作。垦殖后，这些土地每年所产粮食，可供三百万人食用一年。
    为充分利用可垦荒地，给国家增产更多粮食，几年来，湖北省党、政领导机关特在各个可垦地区设立了许多小型的国营农场。目前，全省已有一百一十个国营农场，共开垦播种了三十四万多亩土地；去年部分重点农场并开始了有计划的垦殖。其中五三农场和沙洋农场计划在几年内扩大耕地到二百多万亩；现在已开垦荒地十三万多亩。
    为进一步有计划地和大规模地垦殖荒地，湖北省各有关部门正在组织力量，准备全面勘测，对可垦荒地和水渍区进行精确的调查。今年，计划先以五三、沙洋、南屏垸、草埠湖、张渡湖等五个国营农场为基础，进行扩建；各扩建农场共开垦荒地四十七万七千亩。目前，万余工人、民工正在紧张地修建和今年开垦有关的石龙过江，南屏垸等水利工程。湖北省人民政府农林厅已订购今年开垦所需的各种农业机械，并已有二十台拖拉机运到沙洋农场。（据新华社讯）
