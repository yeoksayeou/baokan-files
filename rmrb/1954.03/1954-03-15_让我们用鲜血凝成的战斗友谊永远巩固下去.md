    Let Us Forever Consolidate the Combat Friendship Cemented with Blood
  　Chen Yi
    Last year, when we were in Korea, we heard that all sectors of Korea would send a delegation to visit our country. Now, this delegation, led by Kim Ung-gi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, has arrived in our country. As comrades-in-arms, especially those of us who have been warmly entertained by them many times, we are very happy and would like to express our most sincere welcome here.
    Korea and China, these two countries, these two nations, have been closely linked together by the three-year-plus struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The people of the two countries, no matter where they meet, in any occasion, are like brothers, talking freely and exchanging their work and combat experiences. At the front lines of the People's Army, the soldiers once told us that the commemorative albums we gave them were being used as personal merit registration books; some soldiers had wrapped the teacups we gave them in cloth for a year and were still reluctant to open them. When building fortifications, People's Army soldiers used shovels to lift the soil and put it on the handcarts of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The fortifications built in this way were inhabited half by the People's Army and half by the Volunteers. A leading comrade from the General Political Bureau of the People's Army told me that this kind of combat friendship is widespread throughout all units of the People's Army and is becoming increasingly profound.
    I remember the situation when we visited a certain coastal artillery position of the People's Army in the Kumgang Mountains. A major general chief of staff came to greet us, driving his jeep at the very front of the road, and that very front road had not been completely cleared of mines. When we arrived at the position, the soldiers built temporary residences to welcome us and specially built a kitchen for us to cook Chinese food. The artillery performed extremely skilled offensive and defensive maneuvers for us. Before leaving, the soldiers personally gave us canes made of hardwood, a special product of the Kumgang Mountains, and each cane was engraved with Chinese characters: "Let Us Forever Consolidate the Combat Friendship Cemented with Blood."
    These words are not just engraved on the canes, are they? These words are engraved in the hearts of every brave Korean and Chinese person.
    I also think of the mountains of Korea, the mountains of Korea are lovely and unforgettable. The Kumgang Mountains are known as the world's garden, and they have not diminished in the slightest even after the war. The car passed over the mountain ridge again, and looking down from the mountain pass, the sea was illuminated by the red sun, and the sparkling waves reflected the golden leaves on the mountain, matched with white snow, it was simply like a famous oil painting. Anyone who sees this scene will exclaim loudly. However, what the Korean mountains gave me was not just this, but courage. Last year, we patrolled from the Old Baldy Mountain on the front line of the Imjin River to the Jiao Yan Mountain on the front line of Kimhwa for more than twenty days, and seeing the continuous positions made me particularly fond of the Korean mountains. It was these heroic mountains, it was the heroes who built heroic positions on these heroic mountains that blocked the enemy and defeated it. Every mountain has a touching story, and every mountain is one that the enemy can climb up but not down. When I was at the highest point of Jiao Yan Mountain, the Korean mountains looked like clouds seen from an airplane, overlapping without any gap to take advantage of. Although the enemy's artillery fire could sometimes hit a mountain peak so that the sun could be seen shining from two or three hundred miles away, only enemy shells had been there, but people had never been there. So it is no wonder that on the two highlands of 537.9 and 597.7 in Shangganling, the enemy suffered more than 20,000 casualties and fired nearly two million shells, but the position did not move at all, and the enemy's dream of seizing Triangle Hill through this ultimately remained just a dream. An enemy prisoner of war, after seeing that Jiao Yan Mountain had been captured by our forces, commented: "The Communist army can capture Jiao Yan Mountain, but the United Nations forces cannot capture Shangganling. What's the use of having more artillery fire!" This can be considered a bit of self-awareness.
    How much the soldiers love the Korean mountains! The soldiers said: "Is it just good-looking? We rely on it to live, rely on it to eat, rely on it to win!" During the war, the soldiers built "homes in the positions" on the mountains, and after the ceasefire, they built "soldiers' paradises," all because they had a deep affection for the Korean mountains. After the ceasefire, the soldiers guarding Red Hill in the Kaesong front line wrote a poem when they left Red Hill:
      In those years, we killed the enemy at Red Hill,
      And gained merit by annihilating the American and Rhee troops,
      Obeying the ceasefire order to leave the mountain,
      The heroes' names are higher than the mountain.
    The soldiers who left the position all wanted to go back and see it again.
    It is precisely this feeling of loving the Korean land, a feeling like loving one's own home, that produced what the soldiers said during the Battle of Shangganling: "It is a glorious mountain, it is a glorious position, it is what we transformed with our labor, we cannot lose it, if we lose it, we must fight back."
    Who can stop this force?
    In the midst of this, I don't know how many fields and trees were destroyed, but for the sake of victory, not a single word of objection was heard from the Korean people. They are also proud that their mountains have become heroic mountains and that the heroic sons and daughters of Korea and China are guarding them. The mountains are so high that ordinary people are daunted by them. Minister Zhu Xuefan once looked up at the top of a high mountain and sighed: "We feel exhausted after climbing once, but the soldiers have to fight, they have to fight up in the enemy's artillery fire!" Therefore, he said: "People living in a peaceful environment must understand how peace is obtained."
    The comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China will surely bring this answer with them this time. This is not an ordinary exchange of pleasantries, but like our previous visits to Korea, it is to convey the mutual care and support between the people of the two countries in the battle; mutual cooperation and assistance in the recovery; and especially important is to convey the great and sublime internationalist morality forged with blood by the people of the two countries in the war, and this is precisely the foundation on which our two countries, the people of the two countries, and our armies were able to defeat enemies with superior equipment with inferior equipment.
    This combat friendship cemented with blood will be forever consolidated, and I wish this friendship will be further strengthened by the arrival and visit of the delegation led by Vice Chairman Kim Ung-gi.

### 让我们用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊永远巩固下去

    让我们用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊永远巩固下去
  　陈沂
    去年我们在朝鲜的时候，就听说朝鲜各界要派一个代表团到我国访问，现在这个代表团在朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会金应基副委员长的率领下已经来到我国了。作为战友的我们，特别是受到他们多次热情款待的我们，感到非常的高兴，愿意在这里表示我们最大欢迎的诚意。
    朝鲜、中国、这两个国家，这两个民族，由于三年多的抗美援朝斗争，已经紧紧的连结在一起了。两国人民，无论在任何地方，任何场合碰见，都像亲兄弟一样，毫无拘束的倾谈，交换各自的工作和战斗经验。在人民军的前线，战士们曾经告诉我们，我们送给他们的纪念册，他们是当作个人立功的登记簿在用；我们送给他们的茶缸子，有的战士用布包了一年还没有舍得打开来用。在修工事的时候，人民军战士用铁锨把土挑起来放在志愿军的手推车上。这样合作修起来的工事，人民军住一半，志愿军住一半。人民军总政治局的一位负责同志告诉我，这种战斗友谊是遍及于人民军的所有部队，而且是越来越深厚了。
    我记起我们在访问金刚山区人民军某海岸炮兵阵地时的情形。一位少将参谋长来迎我们，自己开着吉普车走到去路的最前面，而那个最前面的去路是没有清扫尽的布雷区。到了阵地，战士们为了迎接我们，修起了临时的住地，并特为我们修了做中国饭的伙房。炮兵为我们演习了极为熟练的攻防动作。临走，战士们亲手把金刚山特产的硬木制成的手杖送给我们，每根手杖上都刻有中国字：“让我们用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊永远巩固下去”。
    这些字又何尝只是刻在一根根的手杖上呢？这些字是刻在每个英勇战斗的朝鲜人和中国人心上的。
    我也想起了朝鲜的山，朝鲜的山是可爱的、难忘的。金刚山被称为世界花园，在战后去看，也还没有丝毫减色。车子又经过山脊，从山口遥望下去，海面给红日映照着，海水浪花激打的闪光，映着山上金黄色的树叶，再配上白雪，简直就像是一幅著名的油画。任何人看到这种情景，都会大声惊叹。然而朝鲜的山给我的还不是这个，而是勇敢。去年，我们从临津江的前线老秃山到金城前线的轿岩山穿巡了二十多天，看到绵延不断的阵地，使我对朝鲜的山特别感到爱好。是这些英雄的山，是英雄们在这些英雄的山上修起了英雄的阵地才把敌人挡住了，并且打败了它。每一个山都有一段动人的故事，每一个山都是敌人上得来就下不去的。当我在轿岩山最高处看的时候，朝鲜的山像在飞机上看云层一样，重重叠叠没有一点隙可乘。尽管敌人的炮火有时可以把一个山头打得二三百里外太阳一照就可以看到发光，但是敌人也只有炮弹到过，人却从来没有到过。所以勿怪上甘岭的五三七·九和五九七·七两个高地，敌人死伤两万多，炮弹倾泻了近两百万发，阵地却一点没有动，敌人想经此夺取五圣山最终还只是一个梦想。一个敌军战俘在看了轿岩山被我攻占后发表感想：“共军可以攻下轿岩山，联合国军却攻不下上甘岭，炮火再多有什么用！”这还算有点自知之明。
    战士们是多么喜爱朝鲜的山呀！战士说：“岂只是好看？依靠它住，依靠它吃，依靠它胜利！”战士在战争时期在山上修“阵地之家”，停战后建“战士乐园”，这都是因为他们对朝鲜的山有了深厚的感情的缘故。停战后，守卫在开城前线红山包的战士，离开红山包时，写下了一首诗：
      当年杀敌红山包，
      痛歼美李立功劳，
      遵守停战把山下，
      英雄名字比山高。
    下了阵地的战士，谁都想再回去看一次。
    正是这种热爱朝鲜土地的感情，像热爱自己的家一样的感情，才产生像上甘岭战斗时战士所说的那样：“是光荣的山，是光荣的阵地，是我们用劳动改造的，不能丢，丢了要打回来。”
    谁能挡住这个力量呢？
    这中间不知毁了多少田园，多少树木，然而为了胜利，没有听见朝鲜人民说一个不字。他们也为他们的山变成英雄山，为朝中两国的英雄子弟守卫住而骄傲。山高得平常人望而生畏。朱学范部长有一次在一个高山下仰望山顶，发生慨叹：“我们爬一次觉得累得要命，战士们却要打呀，要在敌人的炮火下打上去呀！”因此他说：“生活在和平环境中的人，必须懂得和平是如何得来的。”
    朝鲜人民访华代表团的同志这次就一定会带着这个答案来。这不是一个普通的交欢，而是像我们历次去朝鲜一样，是传达两国人民在战斗中的互相关怀，支持；在恢复中的互相合作，帮助；而尤其重要的是传达两国人民在战争中用鲜血缔造的伟大的、崇高的国际主义的道德，而这个正是我们两个国家，两国人民和我们的军队所以能够用劣势装备打败优势装备敌人的基础。
    这个用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊会永远巩固下去的，我并祝这个友谊因金应基副委员长所率领的代表团的到来和访问而益发加强起来。
