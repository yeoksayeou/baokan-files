    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Emphasize the Supply of Farm Tools
    —Reader's Letters and Commentary
    Lin Xi
    Educated by the General Line, the broad masses of peasants have actively participated in the cause of building socialism, selling surplus grain to the state and investing the proceeds in production, striving to harvest more grain and industrial raw materials to support national industrial construction. Therefore, as the spring plowing season approaches, doing a good job in supplying the means of production and meeting the production needs of farmers has become the most important task of rural supply and marketing cooperatives at present. According to readers' letters, many supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have already or are actively carrying out this work. For example, the Xinjiang Provincial Cooperative prepared 1,500 tons of iron last winter, which can be used to manufacture more than 600,000 pieces of farm tools. The cooperatives in twelve counties of the Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province organized 342 iron and wood farm tool production groups, repairing and manufacturing more than 100,000 pieces of farm tools. The Yetao and other six joint village cooperatives in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, supplied more than 4,800 pieces of farm tools such as plows and harrows. These efforts have been a strong support for the farmers' patriotic production increase movement.

    However, readers' letters also reflect that some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have not given due attention to the operation of farm tools. For example, farmers in Shanjia Gou Village, Ba District, Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, need to add 106 large and small farm tools this spring. They often go to the cooperative to ask them to quickly find ways to supply them. However, the cooperative does not pay attention to these requests, and now the materials in the cooperative, except for a few plowshares and iron hoes, are all consumer goods. The farmers in the village have to delay production and travel dozens of miles to find blacksmiths to make farm tools. The Hulan Central Cooperative in Si District, Panshi County, Jilin Province, the Longwangmiao Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Xinglong Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shisi District rarely operate in the means of production. Farmers "can't get what they want" and have to run to the county seat to buy farm tools. Farmers in Xiagezhuang, Laixi County, Shandong Province, need chaff cutters, sickles, and steel plows, but the village supply and marketing cooperative only used a dozen rusty chaff cutters in stock to deal with retail sales. Farmers had to compete to buy them on the market, which led to an increase in local farm tool prices. According to statistics this year, about 41,000 pieces of farm tools are needed by the masses in Jiexian County, Shanxi Province, but the county's cooperative has only prepared more than 10,000 pieces so far. In the Huanggang Special District of Hubei Province, only 3% of the cooperative's processing orders with local handicrafts are farm tools, and some counties have no orders at all.

    "Afraid of losing money, afraid of stockpiling, and afraid of trouble" are the main ideological obstacles for some supply and marketing cooperative cadres who are unwilling to operate farm tools. It should be pointed out that this is a manifestation of capitalist business ideology and is incompatible with the operating principles of our socialist cooperative commerce. Of course, there are many varieties and specifications of farm tools, and operating farm tools is a complex and meticulous task; however, serving agricultural production is a major task of supply and marketing cooperatives, and we must overcome the wrong idea of ​​"being afraid of trouble," actively supply the means of production needed by farmers, and support farmers in developing production. As for "stockpiling" and "losing money," these are the results of poor management; if we can act according to the opinions of the farmers and rely closely on the masses, the work can be done well. The cooperatives in Beian County, Heilongjiang Province, and Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, have played a significant role in improving the operation and production of farm tools by adopting methods such as signing combined contracts, going to the countryside with samples for visits and investigations, and holding exhibitions. Some areas, with the consent of the farmers, have adopted the method of pre-collecting partial deposits when supplying farm tools, which can not only strive for initiative in supply, but also rely on the masses to solve some of the difficulties in insufficient funds. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should pay attention to studying various favorable conditions in their localities and create more and better methods.

    Some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas feel that there is no way to do a good job in supplying farm tools because of the lack of raw materials needed to manufacture small farm tools—especially pig iron. Of course, the lack of local raw materials is a practical difficulty, but it is not insurmountable. The supply and marketing cooperatives in Xiaoshan County and Yuhuan County in Zhejiang Province, Huai'an County in Jiangsu Province, and Wenshan County and Zhaotong County in Yunnan Province have achieved great success by actively purchasing old iron and scrap steel to manufacture farm tools. The Xiaoshan County Cooperative used old iron to manufacture farm tools, and the price was reduced by 31%, and the quality was not worse than farm tools made of new iron. The Wenshan County Cooperative vigorously promoted the collection of scrap iron to manufacture farm tools to farmers, and went to the countryside to purchase them, collecting more than 1,000 kilograms in five days. This shows that there are many waste steel and scrap iron stored in the folk, and the supply and marketing cooperatives can purchase them and use them to manufacture farm tools, which can not only solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, save materials for the country, but also allow farmers to turn dead things into living money and invest in production. Cooperatives in various places should learn from this experience, and according to the principle of local materials, local processing, and local supply, use the scrap iron and steel stored in the folk to solve the current difficulty of insufficient raw materials for farm tools.

    Spring plowing is being actively prepared or has already begun in various places. It is hoped that supply and marketing cooperatives in various places will pay attention to this work, give full play to their initiative and creativity, overcome various wrong ideas, and vigorously supply the means of production for agricultural production.

    供销合作社应该重视农具供应工作
    ——读者来信述评

    经过总路线的教育，广大农民群众积极地参加了建设社会主义的事业，把余粮卖给国家，并把所得粮款投入生产，争取收获更多的粮食和工业原料，以支援国家工业建设。因此，当着春耕快要开始的时候，做好生产资料的供应工作，满足农民生产要求，就成为农村供销合作社当前最重要的任务。据读者来信反映，很多地区的供销合作社已经或正在积极进行这一工作。例如，新疆省合作社在去年冬季就准备了一千五百吨铁，可以制造农具六十余万件。山西长治专区十二个县合作社组织了三百四十二个铁木农具生产小组，修补和制造了十万多件农具。河北武安县冶陶等六个联村合作社供应了犁、耙等农具四千八百多件。这些工作，对农民的爱国增产运动是一个有力的支持。
    但是，读者来信中也反映了：某些地区的供销合作社对经营农具的工作还没有引起应有的重视。例如，陕西米脂县八区善家沟村农民今春需要添置大小农具一百零六件。他们经常到合作社去要求赶快想办法供应。但合作社却并不注意这些要求，现在社里的物资除了几个铧和铁铣外，都是消费品。该村农民只得耽误生产，到数十里路以外找铁匠来打农具。吉林磐石县四区呼兰中心合作社、龙王庙村供销合作社和十四区兴隆村供销合作社都很少经营生产资料，农民“要啥没啥”，只得跑进县城去买农具。山东莱西县夏格庄农民需要铡刀、镰刀和钢犁，但该村供销合作社仅以积存的十几张生锈的铡刀拿来应付门市，农民不得不到市场上去争购，引起了当地农具价格的上涨。山西省解县据今年统计，群众所需农具约四万一千件，但该县合作社到现在只准备了一万多件。湖北黄冈专区合作社与当地手工业的加工订货，仅有百分之三是农具，有些县则根本没有订货。
    “怕赔钱、怕积压、怕麻烦”，是某些供销合作社干部不愿经营农具的主要思想障碍。应该指出，这是资本主义经营思想的一种表现，和我们社会主义性质的合作社商业的经营方针是不相容的。当然，农具的品种、规格繁多，经营农具是一件复杂而细致的工作；但是，为农业生产服务是供销合作社的一个主要任务，我们必须克服“怕麻烦”的错误思想，积极供应农民需要的生产资料，支持农民发展生产。至于“积压”和“赔钱”，则是经营不善的结果；如果我们能够根据农民的意见办事，并紧紧依靠群众，工作是可以做好的。黑龙江北安县、松江双城县合作社采用订结合合同、带样品下乡进行访问调查以及召开展览会等方式，对改善农具的经营和生产上，起了很大的作用。有些地区征得农民的同意，在供应农具时采用了预收部分订金的办法，既能争取供应主动，又能依靠群众解决一部分资金不足的困难。各地供销合作社应该注意研究当地各种有利条件，创造更多更好的办法。
    某些地区的供销合作社因为当地缺少制造小农具所需原料——特别是生铁，就感到没有办法做好农具供应工作。当然，当地原料不足是一个实际困难，但也并不是不能克服的。浙江萧山县、玉环县，江苏淮安县和云南文山县、昭通县等地的供销合作社，积极收购旧铁废钢来制造农具，就获得了很大的成绩。萧山县合作社利用旧铁制造农具，价格降低了百分之三十一，质量也不比新铁制造的农具差。文山县合作社大力向农民宣传收废铁制造农具，并下乡收购，在五天内就收了一千多斤。这说明民间储存的废钢废铁很多，供销合作社加以收购，用来制造农具，不仅可以解决原料不足的困难，替国家节省了物资，同时也使农民把死东西换成活钱，投入生产。各地合作社应该很好接受这一经验，根据就地取材、就地加工、就地供应的原则，采用民间存藏的废铁废钢来解决当前农具原料不足的困难。
    各地春耕正在积极准备或已经开始，希望各地供销合作社重视这一工作，发挥积极性、创造性，克服各种错误思想，大力为农业生产供应生产资料。
