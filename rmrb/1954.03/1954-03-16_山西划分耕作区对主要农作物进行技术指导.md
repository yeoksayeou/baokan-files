    Shanxi Province's Department of Agriculture has begun to divide the province into five cultivation areas this year: Southern Shanxi, Northern Shanxi, Central Shanxi, Western Shanxi, and Southeastern Shanxi. It will provide technical guidance for eight major crops in these areas during their growth process, categorized by area and type. Each special district and county has also formulated agricultural technical guidance programs suitable for local needs based on this method. This zonal and categorized technical guidance for agricultural production is based on the different situations and needs of the local terrain, climate, crops, and cultivation techniques. For example, the Southern Shanxi cotton and wheat producing area is characterized by a warm climate, flat terrain, and good soil quality. However, farmers lack fertilizer, wheat fields are not rotated, and there are many pests and diseases. This year, the area will focus on guiding farmers to develop fertilizer sources, expand the fertilizer application area, and increase the amount of fertilizer applied; improve wheat cultivation techniques and promote wheat rotation; and actively prevent and control pests and diseases to reduce cotton boll and bud drop and ensure the continuous increase of cotton and wheat yields. While implementing zonal and categorized guidance for agricultural production techniques, various localities will also focus on six major techniques that have universal significance for increasing agricultural production: close planting, increased fertilizer application, deep plowing for moisture conservation, and prevention and control of pests and diseases. In agricultural technology reform, various localities will take state-owned agricultural enterprises and mutual aid cooperative organizations as the core, forming a network of agricultural technology extension throughout the region, using local materials and promoting them locally.
      The terrain of Shanxi Province is complex, with mountains and hills accounting for 75 percent of the total land area. The climate in the south and north is separated by two seasons, and the types and cultivation techniques of crops are also quite different. In the past, the agricultural leadership departments did not have a sufficient grasp of these characteristics, and there were deviations such as untimely technical guidance, blindly promoting foreign experience, and mechanically copying methods. This year, Shanxi Province's total grain output is expected to increase by 7 percent compared to last year, and the total cotton output is expected to increase by 26.7 percent compared to last year, which requires tapping the potential of production. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture analyzed the above situation and successively sent technical personnel to conduct special investigations and research on soil, meteorology, temperature and other relevant data in various places, providing a reliable basis for formulating this year's agricultural technical guidance program.

    山西划分耕作区对主要农作物进行技术指导
    山西省人民政府农业厅今年开始把全省划分为晋南、晋北、晋中、晋西和晋东南五种耕作区，对八种主要农作物在生长过程中分区、分类进行技术指导。各专区和各县也按照这种办法制订了适合当地需要的农业技术指导方案。这种分区、分类对农业生产技术进行指导，是根据各地的地势、气候、农作物及其耕作技术等不同情况和需要进行的。如晋南棉麦产区的特点是气候温暖，地势平坦，土质良好；但农民缺乏肥料，麦田不调茬换种，病虫害较多。该区今年就要着重指导农民开辟肥源，扩大施肥面积，增加施肥量；改进小麦栽培技术，推行小麦轮作法；并积极预防和扑灭病虫害，减少棉花落铃、落蕾现象，保证棉麦产量的不断提高。各地实行分区、分类指导农业生产技术的同时，并将抓紧对农业增产带有普遍意义的密植、增施肥料、深耕保墒和防治病虫害等六大技术。在农业技术改革中，各地将以国营农业企业和互助合作组织为核心，组成遍布各地的农业技术推广网，就地取材，就地推广。
      山西省全境地形复杂，山岳和丘陵地带占总土地面积的百分之七十五；南部和北部气候相隔两个节令，农作物种植的种类和栽培技术也不大相同。农业领导部门过去因对这些特点掌握不够，曾发生过技术指导不适时，盲目推广外来经验和乱搬乱套等偏向。山西省今年粮食总产量要比去年增加百分之七，棉花总产量比去年增加百分之二十六点七，这便需要发掘生产潜在力。山西省人民政府农业厅分析了上述情况，曾陆续派出技术人员专门调查研究了各地的土壤、气象、温度等有关资料，为制订今年的农业技术指导方案提供了可靠的根据。
