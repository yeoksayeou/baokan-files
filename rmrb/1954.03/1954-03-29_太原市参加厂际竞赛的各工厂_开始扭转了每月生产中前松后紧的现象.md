    Taiyuan Factories Participating in Inter-Factory Competition
    Begin to Reverse the Phenomenon of Slackness at the Beginning and Tightness at the End of Each Month's Production
    Since the launch of the inter-factory competition in Taiyuan City in January this year, it has powerfully promoted production and reversed the long-standing phenomenon of slackness at the beginning and tightness at the end of each month, laying a solid foundation for the comprehensive over-fulfillment of the first quarter's production plan.
    Of the twenty-one units participating in the inter-factory competition, nineteen units completed or over-fulfilled the total output value in January, and twenty-three of the twenty-six major products completed or over-fulfilled the plan; in February, except for one unit, all completed the total output value, and twenty-seven of the twenty-nine products completed the plan. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's seven main production departments—iron smelting, open-hearth steelmaking, electric furnace steelmaking, steel rolling, sheet metal, coking, and refractory materials—completed and over-fulfilled the state plan in both January and February. The electric furnace steelmaking department set a new national smelting record of smelting one furnace of steel in 3 hours and 57 minutes on February 18th. The sheet metal department created five new rolling records in ten days from February 9th to 19th. Through the inter-factory competition, the attendance rate and balanced production rate of each factory and mine are generally above 95 percent. In order to meet the conditions of the inter-factory competition and comprehensively and balancedly over-fulfill the state plan, each factory and mine has launched a wave of finding shortcuts, tapping potential, learning advanced experiences, and strengthening technical learning. Zhang Huaisan, a young worker in the repair workshop of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, studied Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit and completed twenty-one days' worth of tasks in fifteen days in February. More than 200 workers from the Jinsheng Textile Factory participated in technical learning, increasing the spindle watching capacity from 400 spindles last year to 430 spindles, with an average increase in labor productivity of more than 13 percent. Engineering and technical personnel and workers enthusiastically participated in the competition movement. The technical personnel and workers of the Taiyuan Paper Mill combined to study the experience of the Shandong Paper Mill in increasing the proportion of self-made pulp. In February, they improved the formula for glazed paper, reducing the cost per ton of glazed paper by more than 2 million yuan while ensuring quality, which can save 2.6 billion yuan annually. In March, fifteen of the twenty-one units completed the state plan for the first ten days of March. The sheet metal, steel rolling, and refractory material departments of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had already completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule by March 18th.

    太原市参加厂际竞赛的各工厂
    开始扭转了每月生产中前松后紧的现象
    太原市厂际竞赛自今年一月份开展以来，有力地推动了生产，扭转了历来前松后紧的现象，给全面超额完成第一季度生产计划，打下了有力的基础。
    参加厂际竞赛的二十一个单位，一月份有十九个单位完成或超额完成了生产总值，二十六种主要产品有二十三种完成或超额完成了计划；二月份除一个单位外，全部完成生产总值，二十九种产品中有二十七种完成计划。太原钢铁厂炼铁、平炉炼钢、电炉炼钢、轧钢、薄板、炼焦、耐火材料七个主要生产部，一二两月份都完成与超额完成了国家计划。电炉炼钢部在二月十八日创造了三点五十七分炼一炉钢的全国冶炼新纪录。薄板部于二月九日至十九日的十天内；连创五次轧制新纪录。通过厂际竞赛，各厂矿的出勤率与均衡率一般在百分之九十五以上。为了达到厂际竞赛的条件，全面均衡地超额完成国家计划，各厂矿掀起了找窍门、挖潜力、学习先进经验、加强技术学习的热潮，太原矿山机器厂修理车间青工张怀善学习王崇伦的首创精神，在二月份十五天当中就完成了二十一天的任务。晋生纺织厂有二百多工人参加了技术学习，看锭能力由去年四百锭提高到四百三十锭，劳动生产率平均提高了百分之十三以上，工程技术人员和工人一块热烈地投入了竞赛运动，太原造纸厂技术人员和工人结合，学习了山东造纸厂加大使用自制浆比重的经验，二月份改进了有光纸的配料方法，在保证质量的基础上，每吨有光纸降低成本二百多万元，全年可节省二十六亿元。三月份，二十一个单位中又有十五个单位完成了三月上旬的国家计划。太原钢铁厂薄板、轧钢、耐火材料等部，至三月十八日，已提前完成了第一季度的生产计划。
