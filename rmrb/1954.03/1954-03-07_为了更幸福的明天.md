    For a Happier Tomorrow
    Bing Fu
    The sun has just set over the hills,
    The fields are shrouded in the twilight,
    From the path winding around the hills,
    Our platoon leader hurries along.
    As he walks, he thinks,
    The scene from the meeting is still stirring in his mind:
    It was the moment when the political commissar finished his report,
    The platoon leader and everyone else crowded onto the stage,
    Excitement made his heart beat especially fast,
    Like handing in a letter of challenge before a battle.
    He squeezed into the crowd and grabbed the writing brush,
    And wrote two lines with a flourish:
    "I'm buying 8,000,000 yuan of construction bonds,
    To make the motherland more prosperous and strong."
    Now he happily hurries back to the garrison,
    Singing softly as he walks.
    He seems to see the newly built chimneys,
    Like dense forests on the hilly ground,
    He also seems to smell the fields plowed by tractors,
    The intoxicating fragrance of the soil coming with the wind.

    A soldier drawing water by the well,
    Runs up to greet his platoon leader:
    "Platoon leader, what's the happy occasion today,
    Why are you so happy?
    Did the regiment commander commend us for making progress in training?
    Or has our General Line study made the honor roll?"
    The platoon leader told the soldier about the meeting,
    The soldier's eyes flashed with excitement,
    "Platoon leader, I'll buy two months' worth of allowances in bonds,
    I also want to contribute a little strength to the motherland."
    The platoon leader smiled and shook his head,
    Gently patted the soldier on the shoulder:
    "The higher-ups said that your allowances are small,
    Buying bonds should not be encouraged among the soldiers,
    Train hard and defend the construction of the motherland,
    Is the greatest hope for you."
    The soldier looked at the platoon leader with emotion,
    And poured out his heart as if he had been wronged:
    "I am a soldier of the National Defense Army,
    Building the motherland is my lofty ideal.
    I remember in those difficult years,
    We exchanged our lives for her liberation,
    I shed blood on the Huaihai Plain,
    I was seriously injured by the Yangtze River,
    Now the motherland is undergoing large-scale construction,
    I must give one share of heat and emit one share of light,
    For a happier tomorrow,
    Isn't it right to endure some hardship now?"

    The sun has long set over the hills,
    The fields are shrouded in twilight,
    The platoon leader holds the soldier's hands tightly,
    Tears of excitement flashing in his eyes.

    为了更幸福的明天
    冰夫
    太阳刚落下山岗，
    原野里暮色苍茫，
    从绕过丘陵的小路，
    匆匆走来了我们的排长。
    他一边走一边想，
    刚才开会的情景还在他心头激荡：
    那是政委做完报告的时刻，
    排长和大家一起拥到主席台上，
    兴奋使他的心跳得特别厉害，
    好像战斗前递求战书一样。
    他挤进人群抓住那管毛笔，
    刷刷地在纸上写了两行： 
    “我买建设公债八十万元，
    让祖国更加繁荣富强。”
    现在他愉快地赶回驻地，
    一边走一边轻声歌唱。
    他仿佛看见那新修的烟囱，
    像丘陵地上密密的树林一样，
    他又像闻到从拖拉机犁过的田野，
    随风送来了阵阵泥土醉人的清香。
    正在井边汲水的一位战士，
    跑上来迎接自己的排长：
    “排长，今天又有什么喜事，
    为什么你高兴成这样？
    是团长表扬我们练兵有了进展？
    还是咱们总路线的学习上了红榜？”
    排长把开会的事告诉了战士，
    战士两眼闪着兴奋的光芒，
   “排长，我买两个月津贴的公债，
    我也为祖国贡献一点力量。”
    排长微笑着摇了摇头，
    轻轻地拍了拍战士的肩膀：
   “上级说，你们津贴少，
    买公债不要在战士中提倡，
    练好本领，保卫祖国建设，
    是对你们的最大希望。”
    战士激动地看着排长，
    受了委曲似地诉说衷肠：
    “我是个国防军战士，
    建设祖国就是我的崇高理想。
    记得在那艰难的岁月，
    我们用生命换来了她的解放，
    在淮海平原我洒过热血，
    在扬子江边我负过重伤，
    如今祖国正在大规模建设，
    我一定得有一分热发一分光，
    为了有个更幸福的明天，
    目前艰苦些岂不应当？”
    太阳早落下山岗，
    原野里暮色苍苍，
    排长紧握着战士的双手，
    眼里闪着激动的泪光。
