Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 18th: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 9th regarding the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" signed by the United States and the Yoshida government.

The statement said: The US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" not only further turned Japan into a US appendage, but also deepened Japan's status as a US military subordinate. What this agreement gives Japan is the strengthening of American political and military rule, the dumping of old American weapons, and the large-scale appearance of American officers in the Japanese army.

The statement pointed out: The signing of this agreement is an act by the US-Japan reactionaries to antagonize the world's peace forces, and at the same time, it is an attempt to strike a blow against domestic peace forces. There is no doubt that with the signing of this agreement, the Yoshida government will increasingly strengthen its fascist rule. The activities of the large number of "US Military Assistance Advisory Groups" and the enactment of the "Military Secrets Protection Law" will help and encourage this tendency. This agreement will not only make Japan's economy increasingly exhausted and the people's lives increasingly miserable, but will also drive the Japanese people into American military prisons.

The statement emphasized: The Japanese people have the right to maintain national independence, freedom, basic human rights, and livelihood, and they bear no obligation to the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" signed by the Yoshida government. This traitorous agreement has nothing to do with the Japanese people who love national independence, peace, and freedom. The Japanese people should do everything in their power to strengthen the unity against the US, against Yoshida, and against rearmament, in order to smash this enslaving agreement.

    号召人民粉碎美日“共同防御援助协定”
    【新华社十八日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部于九日就美国和吉田政府所签订的美日“共同防御援助协定”发表声明。
    声明说：美日“共同防御援助协定”不仅把日本进一步变成了美国的附庸国，而且加深了日本作为美国的军事附属国的地位。这项协定所给予日本的，是美国在政治上和军事上统治的加强，是美国造的旧军火的倾销，是美国军官大量出现在日本军队中。
    声明指出：这项协定的签订是美日反动派与全世界和平力量为敌的行为，同时也是企图给国内和平力量以打击。毫无疑问，随着这项协定的签订，吉田政府一定会越来越加强法西斯统治。人数众多的“美国军事援助顾问团”的活动和“军机保护法”的制定将会帮助和鼓励这种倾向。这项协定不仅会使日本的经济越来越山穷水尽，人民的生活越来越悲惨，而且会把日本人民赶进美国的军事监狱里去。
    声明强调说：日本人民有维护民族独立、自由、基本人权和生活的权利，他们对吉田政府所签订的美日“共同防御援助协定”并不负有任何义务。这个卖国协定对于热爱民族独立、和平与自由的日本人民是没有任何关系的。日本人民应该竭尽全部力量加强反美、反吉田和反对重整军备的团结，以粉碎这项奴役协定。
