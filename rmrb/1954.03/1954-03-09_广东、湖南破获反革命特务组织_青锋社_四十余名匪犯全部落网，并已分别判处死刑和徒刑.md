Guangdong and Hunan Provincial Public Security Bureaus, Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yuebei Administrative Office Public Security Bureau, Xiangnan Administrative Office Public Security Department, and the Public Security Bureaus of Hengyang, Chenxian, Yizhang and other cities and counties, based on reports from the people and after careful investigation, recently jointly cracked down on a Kuomintang-American special agent organization lurking called the "Qingfeng Society". Counter-revolutionary elements Luo Ding'an, Wan Chunhe, Zhou Jingqiu, Zhang Yizhi, Zeng Yisheng, Li Changgeng, Tang Qian, Liao Chusheng and more than forty others were all arrested. At the same time, a batch of forged documents, secret intelligence chemicals and other important evidence used by the special agent organization to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities were seized. After repeated interrogation and verification, the principal counter-revolutionary element Luo Ding'an and other criminals could not deny the charges in the face of human and material evidence, and all confessed to their crimes of carrying out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. The Guangdong Provincial, Hunan Provincial, and Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureaus respectively filed public prosecutions with the Guangdong Provincial, Hunan Provincial, and Guangzhou Municipal People's Courts. The Guangdong Provincial, Hunan Provincial, and Guangzhou Municipal People's Courts, based on the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries," sentenced counter-revolutionary criminals Luo Ding'an, Wan Chunhe, Zhou Jingqiu, Zhang Yizhi, Li Changgeng, Tang Qian, Liao Chusheng, Tang Shaopei, Tu Zhixun, Li Wenli, Zhu Ming, Wu Guangzhang, Liu Dongge and thirteen other criminals to death, to be executed immediately in Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Chenxian and other places where the criminals carried out counter-revolutionary activities. Other criminals were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.

The "Qingfeng Society" is a counter-revolutionary special agent organization formed by the collusion of lurking special agents and escaped counter-revolutionary elements. It is directly led by the Kuomintang Central Committee Second Group, a special agent organ of the Chiang Kai-shek gang stationed in Hong Kong, and is directly commanded by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Jiang Guozhong, who is stationed in Hong Kong. The main culprit in the case, Luo Ding'an, was originally a Chiang Kai-shek army commander. At the end of November 1949, he was captured by the People's Liberation Army in Baise County, Guangxi Province, and sent home after education. However, the criminal's ambition did not die, and in May 1950, he sneaked into Hong Kong and Kowloon, joined the Kuomintang-American special agent organization, and accepted the dispatch of the Mao Sen faction of Kuomintang-American special agent organs located in Hong Kong. In November of the same year, he sneaked into the Xiangnan area of ​​Hunan Province to carry out covert counter-revolutionary activities. He recruited a group of escaped counter-revolutionary elements and formed a counter-revolutionary armed special agent organization, conspiring to plot a counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, seize the opportunity to assassinate responsible Party and government cadres and activists, and blow up railway bridges and burn warehouses and materials.

In May 1951, after our vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Luo and others used disguises such as doing odd jobs, making straw mats, selling dry tobacco and medicinal materials as cover, and forged the seals, credentials, and passes of our People's Government to travel to and from transportation hubs and construction sites, probing our military, political, and civil affairs intelligence, and then writing with secret writing chemicals and sending them to the Kuomintang-American special agent organs in Hong Kong. In April 1953, the Kuomintang-American special agent organs in Hong Kong dispatched special agent Li Shiying back to Guangzhou, instructing Luo to organize the "Xiangnan Intelligence Group" and develop the organization under the name of "Qingfeng Society" in order to collect our military and economic intelligence, and appointed Luo as the leader of the intelligence group.

The main way for Luo and others to conduct espionage activities was to try every means to infiltrate our key departments and industrial and mining enterprises to seize the opportunity to develop the organization. To this end, Luo and others disguised themselves as unemployed workers and infiltrated our Yuebei mines and the Liputou telecommunications section of Shaoguan City, as well as other factories, mines and basic construction sites. Because of lax leadership and management in Yuebei mines, many counter-revolutionary elements and local tyrants who had escaped from Hunan Province during the land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries had infiltrated. Therefore, Luo attempted to use Qujiang No. 16 mine as his special agent activity "base," and actively developed a special agent organization in the mine, carrying out activities in a big way. In total, they developed Liao Chusheng, a bandit leader hiding in the mine, Wan Chunhe, a Chiang Kai-shek major general, Zhang Yizhi, Li Changgeng, and Zhou Jingqiu, officers at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and other counter-revolutionary elements who had escaped justice. In Shaoguan City, they developed Zhang Zhenbang, a pseudo-battalion commander, Zhu Ming, a pseudo-district chief, and Zhang Shangchu, Hu Linlian and other escaped counter-revolutionary elements. Luo appointed them as the heads of special agent organizations in Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Chenxian, Hengyang, Leiyang, Changsha, Yueyang and other places, attempting to use these important cities along the Yuehan Railway as strongholds for their special agent activities. Luo also assigned special agent Zhou Heng and others to open a barbershop in Guangzhou as a contact point for special agent activities in order to maintain regular contact with the Kuomintang-American special agent organs in Hong Kong. Luo also sent special agents Yang Sufen, Huang Lijuan, Chen Zuying and others, using their status as unemployed workers and taking advantage of the ideological paralysis of some of our agency personnel, to infiltrate our internal organs as nannies and odd-job workers in an attempt to lurk in our key military and political departments for a long time and carry out sabotage activities.

However, no matter how insidious and cunning the enemy is, our People's Public Security Organs, with the active support of the broad masses of our people, have finally captured all these special agent bandits and crushed the enemy's evil conspiracy.

    广东、湖南破获反革命特务组织“青锋社”
    四十余名匪犯全部落网，并已分别判处死刑和徒刑
    广东、湖南两省人民政府公安厅、广州市人民政府公安局以及粤北行署公安局、湘南行署公安处和衡阳、郴县、宜章等市、县公安局根据人民群众的检举，经过严密的侦察，最近共同破获了一个美蒋匪帮潜伏的特务组织“青锋社”，反革命分子罗定安、万春和、周经球、张一志、曾宜生、李长庚、唐乾、廖楚生等四十余名全部落网。同时查获了该特务组织赖以进行反革命破坏活动的一批伪造证件、密写情报药剂及其他重要罪证。经过反复审讯查对，首要反革命分子罗定安及其他各犯在人证、物证前面无可抵赖，都供认了他们进行反革命破坏活动的罪行。广东省、湖南省公安厅，广州市公安局分别将该案向广东省、湖南省、广州市人民法院提起公诉，广东省、湖南省、广州市人民法院根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”判处反革命罪犯罗定安、万春和、周经球、张一志、李长庚、唐乾、廖楚生、唐绍沛、涂志勋、李文立、朱明、伍光章、刘东阁等十三名罪犯死刑，分别在各该罪犯进行反革命活动的广州、韶关、长沙、株州、衡阳、郴县等地立即执行。其他各犯分别判处各种徒刑。
    “青锋社”是一个潜伏特务与漏网反革命分子相勾结的反革命特务组织，直接受蒋匪驻香港的特务机关“国民党中央委员会第二组”的领导，并直接受该特务机关派驻香港的特务分子蒋匪国中的指挥。该案主犯罗定安，原系蒋匪军团长，一九四九年十一月底在广西省百色县被我人民解放军俘获，经我教育后遣散回家。但该犯野心不死，于一九五○年五月潜逃香港、九龙，参加了美蒋特务组织，接受设在香港的美蒋匪帮毛森系特务机关的派遣，于同年十一月潜入湖南省的湘南地区，进行隐蔽的反革命活动。他网罗了一批漏网的反革命分子，成立了反革命武装特务组织，阴谋策划反革命的武装叛乱，伺机刺杀我党政负责干部和积极分子，并爆破铁路桥梁，烧毁仓库物资。
    一九五一年五月，在我大张旗鼓镇压反革命后，罗犯等以做散工、作草席、卖旱烟和药材等为掩护，并伪造我人民政府的关防、印信、通行证等来往于交通要道、建筑工地，刺探我军事、政治、民情等情报，然后用密写药剂书写后寄往香港的美蒋特务机关。一九五三年四月，香港的美蒋特务机关派遣特务分子李世英潜回广州，指示罗犯组织“湘南情报组”，以“青锋社”的名义发展组织，以便收集我军事、经济等情报，并委派罗犯担任该情报组组长。
    罗犯等进行特务活动的主要方式，是想尽一切办法打入我要害部门和工矿企业单位，伺机发展组织。为此，罗犯等曾伪装为失业工人，打入我粤北矿山及韶关市黎铺头电务段等厂矿和基本建设工地。而粤北矿山由于我领导管理松懈，曾混入不少在土地改革、镇压反革命期间由湖南省逃亡来的反革命分子和地主恶霸，因而罗犯企图以曲江一六矿山为其特务活动“基地”，在该矿山积极地发展了特务组织，大肆活动。计先后发展了潜藏在该矿山的土匪头子廖楚生，蒋匪少将军官万春和、中校军官张一志、李长庚、周经球等漏网反革命分子，在韶关市发展了伪营长张振邦、伪区长朱明及张尚初、胡临琏等逃亡反革命分子；并由罗犯委派他们分别担任广州、韶关、郴县、衡阳、耒阳、长沙、岳阳等地特务组织的负责人，企图以这些粤汉铁路沿线的重要城市为其进行特务活动的据点。罗犯还指派特务分子周衡等在广州开设理发店，作为进行特务活动的联络地点，以便经常与香港美蒋特务机关取得联系。罗犯还派特务分子杨素芬、黄丽娟、陈祖英等以失业工人身份，利用我某些机关人员思想的麻痹，分别打入了我机关内部，充当保姆和勤杂人员，企图长期潜伏在我军政要害部门，进行破坏活动。
    但是，不管敌人是如何的阴险狡猾，我人民公安机关在我广大人民群众的积极支持下，终于将这批特务匪徒全部擒获，粉碎了敌人的罪恶阴谋。
