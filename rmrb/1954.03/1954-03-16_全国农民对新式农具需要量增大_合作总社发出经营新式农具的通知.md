    National Farmers' Demand for New Agricultural Tools Increases
    General Cooperative Issues Notice on Operating New Agricultural Tools
    One of the more prominent features of this year's spring plowing is the increased demand from farmers for new agricultural tools. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide have prepared more than 250,000 units of various new agricultural tools based on farmers' requests. The Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has increased its plan for supplying new agricultural tools from 38,000 units to 64,000 units, and has also ordered a large number of double-wheeled plows and waterwheels. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative Federation has ordered a large number of parts from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory to help farmers solve the problem of repairing and fitting their original step plows and waterwheels. The former Suiyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has ordered 20,000 new-style step plows from industrial departments, and farmers paid a deposit to the cooperative in advance when ordering.
    Over the past two years, the national cooperative system, entrusted by the state, has supplied more than 650,000 new agricultural tools in 21 provinces and cities, and has worked with agricultural departments to widely teach farmers the technology of using new agricultural tools. In North China and East China alone, approximately more than 10 million farmers have received technical guidance. The more than 40,000 waterwheels supplied to the North China region have turned more than 1.88 million mu of dry land into irrigated land, increasing grain production by more than 90 million jin per year. The Jia Zhaoguang mutual aid group in Jiantou Village, Linfen County, Shanxi Province, used new-style step plows for deep plowing and intensive cultivation last year, producing 150 jin more grain per mu. According to typical surveys in Liaodong, Rehe, and Songjiang provinces, after adopting new agricultural tools to increase production, rural purchasing power in 1953 increased by one to two times compared to 1951. New agricultural tools are more expensive, making it difficult for individual farmers to purchase and use them. According to surveys, 70 percent of the waterwheels supplied to the North China region in the past were jointly used by organized farmers. During this year's spring plowing season, with the rapid development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the number of farmers organized in various places to use new agricultural tools will greatly increase.
    The All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued a notice to the national cooperative system on the operation of new agricultural tools in 1954.
    The notice said: With the development of agricultural production, farmers' purchasing power has increased, and farmers' investment in agricultural production materials has grown year by year. Especially with the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the number of farmers requesting to use large agricultural tools and new agricultural tools has greatly increased. Therefore, cooperatives should, according to the needs of farmers and with the assistance and guidance of agricultural departments, adopt a positive attitude to independently operate or operate various new agricultural tools on behalf of agricultural departments, based on local conditions. All areas with operating conditions should actively operate independently. Independent operation should focus on various types of step plows, waterwheels, and weeding hoes, and can also operate rice threshers, corn shellers, sweet potato slicers, weeding machines, etc., according to the needs of farmers in various places. For other new agricultural tools, if possible, they can be operated on behalf of agricultural and water conservancy departments. When formulating supply plans, it is necessary to investigate and study the quantity, season, specifications, quality, etc. required by farmers, and negotiate the operating plan with agricultural departments.
    The notice pointed out: In order to promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the supply of new agricultural tools should first meet the requirements of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, but a positive attitude must also be adopted towards individual farmers, providing them with supplies.
    The notice said: To do a good job in promoting new agricultural tools, technical guidance and repair work are still key issues. Therefore, while supplying new agricultural tools, it is necessary to cooperate with agricultural departments to do a good job in technical guidance. New agricultural tool repair stations should be set up at appropriate locations, or iron production cooperatives and individual blacksmith shops should be entrusted to concurrently engage in repair work.

### 全国农民对新式农具需要量增大  合作总社发出经营新式农具的通知

    全国农民对新式农具需要量增大
    合作总社发出经营新式农具的通知
    今年春耕生产中比较突出的特点之一是农民对新式农具的需要量扩大了。据中华全国合作社联合总社统计，目前全国供销合作社根据农民的要求，已经准备好的各种新式农具达二十五万多具。河南省供销合作社已把供应新式农具三万八千部的计划提高到六万四千部，同时订购了大批双轮铧犁和水车。山东省合作社联合总社为帮助农民解决原有步犁、水车的修配问题，向华北农业机械总厂订购了大批零件。原绥远省供销合作社已向工业部门订购新式步犁两万部，在订购时，农民预先向合作社缴付了一批订金。
    两年来，全国合作社系统接受国家委托，在二十一个省、市供应新式农具达六十五万多部，并协同农业部门广泛向农民传授了使用新式农具的技术。仅华北、华东两区就有大约一千多万农民受到了技术指导。供应给华北地区的四万多辆水车，已使一百八十八万多亩旱地变成了水浇地，每年粮食产量可提高九千多万斤。山西省临汾县涧头村贾兆光互助组去年使用新式步犁深耕细作，每亩地多打了粮食一百五十斤。据辽东、热河、松江等省的典型调查，采用新式农具提高产量后，一九五三年农村购买力比一九五一年提高了一倍到两倍。新式农具的价格较高，个体农民购买和使用都有困难。据调查，过去供应华北地区的水车，百分之七十是农民组织起来合用的。今年春耕期间随着农业互助合作运动迅速发展，各地组织起来的农民采用新式农具的数量将大大增加。
    中华全国合作社联合总社向全国合作社系统发出了一九五四年经营新式农具的通知。
    通知说：随着农业生产的发展，农民购买力提高，农民在农业生产资料方面的投资逐年增长，特别在互助合作运动迅速发展的情况下，农民要求使用大农具和新式农具的数量大大增加。因此，合作社应根据农民需要并在农业部门的协助与指导之下，因地制宜地采取积极态度实行自营或代农业部门经营各种新式农具。凡有经营条件的地区，都应积极自营。自营以各式步犁、水车、耘锄为主，并可按各地农民需要情况兼营打稻机、玉米脱粒机、甘薯切片机、锄草机等。对其他新式农具，如有可能可代农业、水利部门经营。在制订供应计划时，必须调查研究农民需要的数量、季节、规格、质量等，与农业部门协商经营计划。
    通知指出：为了促进互助合作运动的开展，新式农具供应应首先满足农业生产合作社和互助组的要求，但对单干户也必须采取积极的态度，给以供应。
    通知说：作好新式农具推广工作，技术指导和修配工作仍是关键性的问题。因此，在新式农具供应的同时，必须与农业部门协作，作好技术指导工作。应在适当地点设置新式农具修配站，或委托铁业生产合作社以及个体铁匠炉兼营修配工作。
