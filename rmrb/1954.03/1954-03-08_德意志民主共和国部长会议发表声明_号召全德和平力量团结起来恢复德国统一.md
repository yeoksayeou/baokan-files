Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 5th (TASS dispatch): The Press Office of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic announced that on March 4th, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the issue of German unification.

The statement pointed out: The government of the German Democratic Republic has stated more than once that bringing the East and West parts of Germany closer together is the most urgent and important task for restoring German unity. What can promote this is primarily economic and cultural cooperation, but the Bonn government and the Bonn parliament have responded to this approach with measures to implement military service laws. The Adenauer government forced the Federal Parliament to pass military articles as a supplement to the constitution, while also adding a clause to the constitution that allows West Germany to unconditionally obey the dictates of the Bonn-Paris military treaty. Under pressure from the pro-American faction within the party, the Social Democratic parliamentary group in the Federal Parliament also advocated organizing West German mercenaries, which is tantamount to directly supporting American military policy and the militarization of West Germany.

The statement said: The government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the most important thing for solving the German question is to reach an agreement among Germans. While talking glibly about "free elections," the Bonn government regards military decrees, the implementation of military service laws, and the realization of military treaties as top priorities. The proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding reaching an agreement has opened a path, namely, to achieve truly free and democratic elections in all of Germany and to achieve the unification of Germany on a democratic and free basis through the formation of an all-German provisional government. The statement pointed out: The Bonn government continues to attempt to create new obstacles to the restoration of German unity in various ways. The statement continued: The government of the German Democratic Republic is very clear that the youth of West Germany are unwilling to sell their lives for the interests of domestic and foreign monopolists and landlords. Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic states that all West German and West Berlin men who refuse to serve in the West German mercenary army will be regarded as citizens enjoying equal rights in the German Democratic Republic and will be given all necessary support. All peaceful forces of the German people must unite to counter the provocative actions of West German militarism.

The statement concluded: We call on the residents of West Germany to express their desire to establish close economic and cultural ties between East and West Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic is always ready to conduct all-German negotiations on all issues that help bring East and West Germany closer together and that aim to establish a unified, peaceful, and independent Germany.

    德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明
    号召全德和平力量团结起来恢复德国统一
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志民主共和国总理新闻处通告，德意志民主共和国部长会议于三月四日就统一德国问题发表声明。
    声明指出：德意志民主共和国政府不止一次地表示过，使德国东西两部亲近是恢复德国统一的一项最迫切和最重要的任务。能促成这一点的首先是要在经济上和文化上进行合作，可是波恩政府与波恩议会却用实行兵役法的一些措施来回答这种做法。阿登纳政府强迫联邦议院通过作为宪法的补充的军事性的条文，同时在宪法上还附加了这样一条，这一条使西德得以无条件地服从波恩与巴黎军事条约的差遣。联邦议院中的社会民主党议会党团在该党的亲美派的压力下，也主张组织西德雇佣军，这就等于直接支持美国的军事政策和西德的军国主义化。  
    声明说：德意志民主共和国政府认为，要解决德国问题，最重要的就是德国人之间达成协议。波恩政府一面高谈“自由选举”一面却把军事法令、实行兵役法以及实现军事条约看成是头等的大事。德意志民主共和国政府关于达成协议的建议已开辟了一条途径，即通过组成全德临时政府以达到在全德进行真正自由民主的选举并达到在民主、自由的基础上统一德国的目的。声明指出：波恩政府继续企图以种种方法来为恢复德国统一造成新的障碍。声明接着说：德意志民主共和国政府很清楚，西德的青年是不愿为国内外的垄断资本家和地主们的利益去卖命的。因此德意志民主共和国政府表示，所有拒绝替西德雇佣军服役的西德和西柏林的男子，在德意志民主共和国将被看成为享有平等权利的公民，并将给他们以一切必要的支持。德国人民的一切和平力量必须团结起来，以对抗西德军国主义的挑拨性的行动。
    声明最后说：我们号召西德居民们申述自己建立德国东西两部经济上和文化上紧密联系的愿望。德意志民主共和国政府随时准备着在有助于德国东西两部的亲近及旨在建立统一、和平、独立的德国的一切问题上进行全德谈判。
