To realize national socialist industrialization, after securing a certain amount of capital and Soviet technical equipment assistance, the issue of talent, especially technical talent, has been elevated to a position of paramount importance. The 141 major projects aided by the Soviet Union are equipped with the world's latest technology and equipment. To install this technology and equipment into factories, and to ensure smooth production after installation, a large number of personnel familiar with the technology and the use of this equipment are needed. To build an automobile manufacturing plant with an annual output of 30,000 vehicles, with Soviet assistance in design, approximately 600 chief engineers, engineers, and technicians, and 800 assistants (college and university graduates) are required; another 1,600 engineering and technical personnel are needed when production begins. The three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace alone organized a technical team of several thousand people during basic construction. Therefore, to complete the 141 projects and carry out normal production, a large number of technical personnel are needed, the number is not just a few thousand, nor a few tens of thousands, but even more. At the same time, to fully utilize the potential of existing industrial technology and equipment in our country, the number of technical personnel required is also very large. As Stalin said, "Technology is dead without personnel who have mastered it. With personnel who have mastered it, technology can and should work wonders." ("Speech at the Graduation Ceremony of the Red Army Academy Students in the Kremlin.") Therefore, the issue of technical personnel has become one of the main issues in the current national industrialization.

How do we solve the problem of technical personnel? On the one hand, we must continuously cultivate new technical personnel in schools and factories, which is the main task, but it takes a relatively long time; on the other hand, we must unite and educate the existing technical personnel to rapidly improve their ideological and professional level, so that they can undertake more work; this can be done immediately and is the urgent task at present.

Over the past four years, local Party committees, factory Party committees, and administrative bodies have resolutely implemented the Party's policy of uniting and educating technical personnel, organized technical personnel to study Soviet advanced experience, and especially after Comrade Mao Zedong issued the call to actively learn from Soviet advanced experience last year, have paid more attention to organizing technical personnel to study Soviet advanced technology. The learning enthusiasm of technical personnel is high, and the gains are not small. As a result, many factories and mines have basically unified their technical guiding ideology with the Soviet Union's advanced experience and advanced thinking, and have basically eliminated the phenomenon of differing opinions, having different sets of principles, and excessively trusting the book knowledge of capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan, and lacking unified technical guidance during the period of economic recovery. At the same time, there has been considerable progress in organizing technical personnel to combine theory with practice and technology with labor. According to Shanxi statistics, more than 80% of technical personnel participated in last year's increase production and practice economy campaign. Many major issues and many major rationalization proposals in the competition were solved and proposed after the combination of technical personnel and workers. Under these circumstances, the growth of our technical team is very rapid. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel increased its technical personnel by nearly ten times from 1949 to September 1953. In addition to the original technical personnel, new young technical personnel graduated from universities and colleges and worker-technicians promoted from among the workers have been added. They each have their own strengths: the original technical personnel have certain practical experience and considerable technical theoretical knowledge, and are still able to independently solve technical problems; young technical personnel generally have a relatively high desire for knowledge; worker-engineering and technical personnel have rich practical experience and have high prestige among the workers. Guiding these technical personnel to unite and help each other, learn from each other's strengths, can make them a good technical team for the country.

However, to fully develop the role of technical personnel in national industrialization, in addition to organizing technical personnel to carry out general political study, such as studying the general line and general tasks during the transition period, it is also necessary to further organize technical personnel to study Soviet advanced experience and to combine theory with practice. Judging from the current situation, greater achievements and more experience have been gained in organizing technical personnel to study Soviet advanced experience, and on this basis, continued efforts can achieve greater results. However, in organizing technical personnel to combine theory with practice and technology with labor, there is not much experience, and there are many problems. From the leadership perspective, many places have still failed to boldly use the original technical personnel. For example, many factories and mines have not established and implemented a technical responsibility system on the basis of implementing planned management; or even if a technical responsibility system has been established, the correct opinions on technical issues raised by technical personnel have not been effectively supported. It should be understood that general technical personnel have a sense of dedication, they hope to make contributions to the country, and they hope that the administration and the Party committee will support their correct opinions on technical issues. This requirement is in line with the interests of the country and the interests of the working class, and we should give it support. It is precisely on this basis that technical personnel can better combine theory with practice and technology with labor, and make more contributions to the country. However, some Party committees, administrative, and trade union leading cadres have not seen this progressive aspect, but only see their backward aspects. In fact, the progressive aspect of technical personnel is the main aspect. According to a survey of certain factories, backward technical personnel account for less than one-tenth of all technical personnel. In recent years, many advanced workers and labor models have emerged among technical personnel. Anshan Iron and Steel has more than 140 engineers, technicians, and apprentice technicians who have been rewarded by the administration and the trade union; among them, 40 people have won the glorious title of Anshan City Labor Model. Tianjin City also has 113 technical personnel who have been elected as labor models. Therefore, we should believe in them and listen to their opinions, which is extremely beneficial to national industrial construction. Last October, the Benxi Municipal Party Committee convened a city-wide conference of technical personnel representatives to mobilize technical personnel to discuss issues such as increasing production and practicing economy, which achieved great results. At the meeting, technical personnel put forward 550 proposals, of which 71.3% were related to improving work, implementing Soviet expert suggestions, and promoting advanced experience; 14.2% requested the establishment of amateur universities, the organization of Russian language learning, and the opening of amateur lectures; and 14.5% were related to life and other aspects. Facts have proved that as long as they are educated according to their characteristics, great results will be achieved. Last year, when many regions conducted ideological education for designers, they summarized one or two projects, rectified design ideas, and enabled all designers to clarify from specific projects what is bourgeois design thinking and what is socialist design thinking, and studied how to embody socialist design thinking in future work, which made technical personnel improve both politically and technically. Of course, there are also a very small number or individual technical personnel who still cling to the technical viewpoints of British and American bourgeoisie, and use this to resist Soviet advanced technology, or are seriously irresponsible in their work, etc. Even so, the Party should still adhere to the policy of strengthening education for these people, and only those who have caused major losses to state property due to serious irresponsibility must be given appropriate punishment.

From the perspective of technical personnel, there are also many ideological problems among technical personnel regarding the issue of combining theory with practice and technology with labor. For example, some people say: "Engineers and technicians are scientific workers, and their working positions are in the research room." "How much invention and creation can workers have!" This statement is inappropriate. This requires us to help technical personnel understand that whether theory and practice can be combined and whether technology and labor can be combined is not only related to the future of national socialist industrialization, but also related to the future of technical personnel. Socialist industrialization requires the rational use of the country's resources; requires the state's construction funds to play the highest efficiency, and requires the use of various advanced working methods to strive to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan. The working masses have a lot of rich experience, and technical personnel also have certain technical theoretical knowledge. As long as the two can be closely combined, the above requirements can be achieved. Facts have also proven that: Zhang Mingshan, an old worker at the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, created an anti-encircling disc with the help of technical personnel; Technical personnel Wu Liangya and old worker Lu Naitao jointly created an automatic steel drawing machine for heating furnaces; Chongqing 102 Factory in Sichuan Province concentrated the wisdom of technical personnel and workers and summarized advanced experience in the oxidation period of steelmaking. The experience of the increase production and practice economy movement has further proved that labor and technology must be combined. Only in this way can this movement be sustained and achieve greater results; at the same time, it can prevent pure physical competition, damage the health of workers, and only focus on completing the plan while relaxing the maintenance and repair of equipment, and damaging machine equipment. The combination of labor and technology can also enrich the technical theoretical knowledge of technical personnel. Here, it should be pointed out to the original technical personnel that, due to the individualism and conservatism of technical personnel in capitalist countries, they are unwilling to teach all their technology to others, and because the technical personnel's theory is not well connected with practice, the technical theoretical knowledge of the past technical personnel is not only backward, but also fragmented and unsystematic. Now, it is a good opportunity to systematize and enrich their technical theoretical knowledge by systematically learning from Soviet advanced experience and summarizing workers' experience. Many facts have also proved that the separation of theory from practice and the separation of technology from labor not only cannot fully develop the role of technical personnel, but also can lead to many serious errors. The cracks in the clearing workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Liaoxi Province, which prevented the installation of machines and production, was the result of not conducting a survey in advance. The reason why the weighing car of the No. 8 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel failed three times after three trial runs, losing 1.5 billion yuan of state wealth, was the result of the designers not listening to the correct opinions of the workers. There are many such examples, and some are even more serious than this. Therefore, it is necessary to patiently educate technical personnel to overcome this ideological style of being divorced from reality. The reason why we emphasize carrying out patient education work is that some technical personnel verbally admit that theory should be connected with practice, but in actual actions, theory is still divorced from practice; or they can combine on this issue, but cannot combine on another issue; or they can combine on small issues, but cannot combine on large issues. It must be made clear to technical personnel that they must bravely overcome this erroneous ideological style and strengthen the connection between theory and practice. When Zhang Mingshan of the small rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel proposed the suggestion of creating an "anti-encircling disc", some engineering and technical personnel said: The problem that cannot be solved even after flipping through the technical theory books of capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan, can a worker solve it? Some people even blocked the experiment of this suggestion. Later, Zhang Mingshan's experiment was successful, and some engineering and technical personnel finally realized the following truth under the education of facts: Why did imperialism fail to experiment successfully, why did Anshan Iron and Steel during the puppet Manchukuo period fail to experiment successfully, but the current small rolling mill succeeded in creating it? There is only one answer: the working class has fully developed their creative talents in New China. Why could Zhang Mingshan create it successfully, but our engineering and technical personnel could not create it successfully? There is also only one answer: Zhang Mingshan's thinking is the thinking of the working class, while we retain the thinking of the bourgeoisie and individualism. Facts show that engineering and technical personnel must improve their political level, learn from workers, and implement the principle of combining technology and labor in order to play the role of technical guidance. Facts have proven that some technical personnel do go deep into reality and go deep among the masses, and study technical issues with the masses. They can continue to move forward and can increasingly play the role of technology in industrial construction; however, some technical personnel have not received practical education from this, so although they express that they want to make progress, they are still standing still or making little progress. This is worthy of warning to all technical personnel.

Educating technical personnel to strengthen the connection between theory and practice and the combination of technology and labor is an arduous task. For this reason, the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must carry out persistent political and ideological education work for technical personnel, and promptly help technical personnel overcome various difficulties in their work. On the other hand, workers should also be constantly educated to recognize the role of technical guidance, overcome narrow empiricist thinking, and accept technical guidance. In recent years, a lot of experience has been created in leading technical personnel to combine theory with practice and technology with labor. Now, it should be summarized and disseminated to fully develop the role of technical personnel in national industrialization.

    充分发挥技术人员在国家工业化建设中的作用
    国家实现社会主义工业化，在有了一定的资金，有了苏联的技术装备援助之后，人材问题，特别是技术人材问题，就被提到了头等重要的地位。苏联援助我国建设的一百四十一项巨大工程，都是世界上最新的技术设备。要使这些技术设备能够安装成一个个工厂，而且在安装起来以后能够顺利地进行生产，就需要有一大批熟悉技术和使用这些技术设备的人材。建设一个年产三万辆汽车的汽车制造厂，在苏联帮助设计的条件下，大约需要总工程师、工程师和技术人员六百多人，助手（大、中学毕业生）八百人；开工生产又需要工程技术人员一千六百多人。鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号炼铁炉三大工程，仅在基本建设中，就组织了一支数千人的技术队伍。因此要完成一百四十一项工程，并进行正常生产，就需要很多的技术人材，其数字不是几千，也不是几万，而是更多。同时，为了充分发挥我国工业原有技术设备的潜在力量，所需要的技术人材，其数目也是很大的。斯大林说得好：“技术没有精通技术的人材，便是死的东西。技术有精通技术的人材来使用，便能够而且应当显出奇迹来。”（“在克里姆林宫举行的红军学院学生毕业典礼大会上的演说。”）因此技术人材问题，已成了当前国家工业化中主要问题之一。
    怎样来解决技术人材问题呢？一方面要在学校和厂矿中不断地培养新的技术人材，这是主要的，但是需要较长的时间；另一方面，就是要团结与教育已有的技术人员，迅速提高其思想与业务水平，使其能够担负更多的工作；这是立即可以做到的，也是目前的迫切任务。
    四年来，各地方党委、各厂矿党委和行政坚决执行了党的团结与教育技术人员的政策，组织技术人员学习了苏联先进经验，特别是去年毛泽东同志发出积极学习苏联先进经验的号召后，更加注意组织技术人员钻研苏联先进技术。技术人员的学习情绪很高，收获也不小。因而已有不少厂矿在技术指导思想上，基本上已经统一于苏联的先进经验和先进思想，基本上消除了经济恢复时期各持己见，各有一套，各自偏信自己所学英、美、德、日等资本主义国家的书本知识，缺乏统一技术指导的现象。同时在组织技术人员实行理论与实际联系、技术与劳动结合方面，也有不小的进步。据山西统计，已有百分之八十以上的技术人员参加了去年的增产节约竞赛。竞赛中的许多重大问题和许多重大的合理化建议，都是在技术人员与工人相结合之后所解决和提出来的。在这种情况下我国技术队伍的生长是很快的。例如鞍钢从一九四九年到一九五三年九月，技术人员增加将近十倍。而且除了原有的技术人员外，新增加了从大、专学校毕业的青年技术人员和从工人中培养提拔起来的工人技术人员。他们各有特长：原有的技术人员有一定的实际经验和相当的技术理论知识，尚能够独立解决技术问题；青年技术人员一般求知欲比较高；工人工程技术人员有丰富的实际经验，在工人中威信较高。引导这些技术人员团结互助，取长补短，就能成为国家一支好的技术队伍。
    但要充分发挥技术人员在国家工业化建设中的作用，除组织技术人员进行一般的政治学习，如学习过渡时期的总路线和总任务外，还须进一步组织技术人员学习苏联先进经验，并把理论与实际联系起来。从目前情况来看，组织技术人员学习苏联先进经验方面，成绩较大，经验较多，在这一基础上继续努力，是可以获得更大的成绩的。但是在组织技术人员实行理论与实际联系，技术与劳动结合方面，经验还不多，并存在着不少问题。从领导方面来说，不少地方至今还未能大胆地使用原有技术人员。例如许多厂矿没有在实行计划管理基础上，建立与贯彻技术责任制；或者即使建立了技术责任制，但对技术人员所提出的有关技术问题的正确意见，也没有切实地予以支持。应该了解，一般技术人员都有事业心，他们希望对国家有所贡献，他们希望行政和党委支持他们所提出的有关技术问题的正确意见。这种要求是符合国家利益的，是符合工人阶级的利益的，我们应该给以支持。正是在这一基础上，技术人员才有可能更好地实行理论与实际联系，技术与劳动结合，为国家作更多的贡献。但是某些党委、行政、工会领导干部恰恰没有看到这一进步方面，而只看到其落后方面。实际上，技术人员的进步方面是主要的。据某些厂的调查，落后的技术人员不到全体技术人员的十分之一。几年来技术人员中还涌现出不少先进工作者和劳动模范。鞍钢就有
  一百四十多个工程师、技术员和见习技术员受到了行政和工会的奖励；其中并有四十人获得了鞍山市劳动模范的光荣称号。天津市也有一百一十三位技术人员当选了劳动模范。因此我们应该相信他们，听取他们的意见，这对国家工业建设是极为有利的。去年十月本溪市委召开全市技术人员代表会议，发动技术人员讨论增产节约等问题，就获得了很大的成效。在会上，技术人员提出了五百五十件提案，其中有关改进工作、贯彻苏联专家建议、推广先进经验的就占百分之七十一点三；要求设立业余大学、组织俄文学习和开办业余讲座的占百分之十四点二；生活与其他方面的占百分之十四点五。事实证明，只要按照他们的特点来对他们进行教育，就会收到很大效果。去年许多地区对设计人员进行思想教育时，通过总结一两项工程，整顿设计思想，使全体设计人员从具体工程中弄清楚什么是资产阶级的设计思想，什么是社会主义的设计思想，并研究出在今后的工作中如何体现社会主义的设计思想，这就使技术人员在政治上和技术上都提高了一步。当然也有极少数或个别技术人员，至今还抱住英美资产阶级的技术观点而不放，并用此来对抗苏联的先进技术，或在工作中严重地不负责任等，虽然如此，但是党对待这些人也应坚持采取加强教育的方针，只有对那种因严重不负责任致使国家财产遭受重大损失的人，才必须给以适当的处罚。
    从技术人员方面来说，目前技术人员中对于理论与实际联系，技术与劳动结合的问题，也存在很多思想问题。例如有人说：“工程师和技术人员是科学工作人员，工作位置在研究室。”“工人能有多大创造发明！”这种说法是不妥当的。这就需要我们帮助技术人员认识理论与实际能否联系，技术与劳动能否结合，不仅关系到国家社会主义工业化的前途，同时关系到技术人员的前途。社会主义工业化建设，要求对国家的资源必须合理的使用；要求国家的建设资金发挥最高的效能，要求用各种先进的工作方法争取全面超额完成国家计划。而工人群众有许多丰富的经验，技术人员也有一定的技术理论知识，只要两者能密切结合，就可以达到上述的要求。事实也已经证明了：鞍钢小型轧钢厂老工人张明山经过技术人员的帮助创造了反围盘；技术人员吴良亚与老工人卢乃涛等共同创造了加热炉自动抽钢机；四川重庆一○二厂集中技术人员与工人的智慧，总结出了炼钢氧化时期操作先进经验。增产节约运动的经验更加证明了劳动与技术必须结合起来。只有这样，才能使这一运动持久，获得更大的成果；同时才能防止单纯体力竞赛，损害工人健康，只顾完成计划而放松对设备的维护检修，损坏机器设备的现象。劳动与技术结合，还可以丰富技术人员的技术理论知识。这里就应当对原有的技术人员指出，由于资本主义国家技术人员的个人主义和保守思想，不愿把自己的全部技术教给别人，加上技术人员理论与实际联系得不好，所以过去一般技术人员的技术理论知识不仅是落后的，而且是零碎的，不系统的，现在正好从系统地学习苏联先进经验和总结工人经验中，来使自己的技术理论知识系统化和更加丰富。许多事实也证明了，理论与实际脱节，技术与劳动脱节，不仅不能充分发挥技术人员的作用，而且还会发生许多严重的错误。辽西锦州纺织厂清花车间裂缝，不能安装机器进行生产，就是事先不进行勘察的结果。鞍钢八号高炉称量车所以三次试车三次失败，损失国家财富十五亿元，就是设计人员不听取工人正确意见的结果。这样的例子是很多的，甚至于有些比这还严重得多。因此必须耐心地教育技术人员克服这种脱离实际的思想作风。所以强调进行耐心的教育工作，是因为有些技术人员在口头上承认理论要与实际联系，但是在实际行动中仍是理论与实际脱节；或者在这一问题上能相结合，而在另一个问题上又不能相结合；或者在小问题上能相结合，在大问题上又不能相结合。要对技术人员说清楚，必须勇敢地来克服这种错误的思想作风，加强理论与实际联系。鞍钢小型轧钢厂有些工程技术人员，在张明山提出创造“反围盘”建议时，曾说过：翻遍英、美、德、日等资本主义国家的技术理论书籍都无法解决的问题，难道一个工人能解决吗？甚至有人拦阻这个建议的试验。后来张明山试验成功了，有的工程技术人员在事实的教育下终于认识了以下的真理：为什么帝国主义没有试验成功，为什么伪满时期的鞍钢也没有试验成功，而现在的小型轧钢厂创造成功了呢？只有一个答案：工人阶级在新中国充分发挥了他们的创造才能。为什么张明山能创造成功，而我们工程技术人员不能创造成功呢？也只有一个答案：张明山的思想是工人阶级思想，而我们则保留着资产阶级的和个人主义的思想。事实说明，工程技术人员必须提高自己的政治水平，向工人学习，贯彻技术与劳动结合的方针，才能发挥技术指导的作用。事实证明，有些技术人员的确深入实际深入群众，与群众一起钻研技术问题，他们就能够不断前进，就能够日益发挥技术在工业建设中的作用；但是有的技术人员并未由此领取实际的教育，因而他们虽然表示要进步，但实际上还是踏步不前或则很少进步。这是值得所有技术人员引以为戒的。
    教育技术人员加强理论与实际联系，技术与劳动结合，是一个艰苦的工作。为此，党和行政、工会、青年团就要对技术人员进行坚持不懈的政治思想教育工作，并及时帮助技术人员克服工作中的各种困难。另一方面，也应该不断教育工人承认技术指导作用，克服狭隘的经验主义思想，接受技术指导。几年来，在领导技术人员实行理论与实际联系，技术与劳动结合方面，也已创造了不少经验，现在就应当加以总结与传播，充分发挥技术人员在国家工业化中的作用。
