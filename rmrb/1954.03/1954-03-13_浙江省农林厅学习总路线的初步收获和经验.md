Preliminary Gains and Experiences of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry in Studying the General Line
The General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry

Since the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry and its affiliated units began studying the Party's general line for the transition period in early November last year, the cadres have shown high enthusiasm for learning. More people are buying theoretical books, and more people are studying on their own in the evenings. The Water Conservancy Bureau's library, which rarely had anyone borrowing theoretical books, has now had all its theoretical books borrowed. Most of the comrades participating in the study have developed study plans. The comrades in the Engineering Bureau, in addition to the scheduled study time, are also using their spare time for self-study.

After three months of study, all staff members have generally understood the basic content of the general line. Due to the education and encouragement of the general line, the political awareness and work enthusiasm of the cadres have generally improved. Many Youth League members have submitted reports to the Party branch, expressing their desire to strive for Party membership through practical actions. Many young people have also actively applied to join the Youth League. Workers in the repair group of the Engineering Bureau's machinery team repaired nine cars in one and a half months, completing the repair task half a month ahead of schedule. The work efficiency of other comrades has also generally improved. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, many cadres whose families are in the countryside have written letters to mobilize their families to sell surplus grain. The political enthusiasm of the cadres can also be seen in this purchase of economic construction bonds, with an average purchase of over 300,000 yuan per person in the entire department.

The department and its affiliated units have begun to examine their work in the spirit of the general line. For example, the Farm Management Division of the department reviewed and summarized its work in 1953, formulated a work plan for 1954, and overcame the previous problems of unclear direction in the work, ideological confusion among farm employees, and poor management of some farms. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Division convened provincial conferences on animal husbandry and veterinary work and pharmaceutical work, determining that the current focus of animal husbandry and veterinary work in Zhejiang Province should be on draught cattle, and that the animal husbandry work in state-owned enterprises and agricultural producers' cooperatives should be done well first. According to this requirement, the division is now promoting the experience of winter animal protection work, which began last winter based on state-owned farms and cooperatives. In addition, the waste of medicines and the occurrence of medical accidents have been greatly reduced. The Water Conservancy Bureau studied how to ensure the steady growth of socialist economic components in water conservancy work, and decided to establish ten pumping stations this year to gain experience, and then prepare to greatly increase the number of stations next year to meet the needs of agricultural production and increase the socialist factors in water conservancy work.

The learning achievements over the past three months have been relatively significant. The main reasons for achieving this success are, first of all, that the leadership attached importance to the study of the general line and carried out full mobilization work at the beginning of the study. Shortly after the study began, the Party Group of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry decided to make the study of the general line by cadres one of the main tasks at present. Liu Jian, Director of the Department and Secretary of the Party Group, gave a report to all cadres on the "General Line of the State During the Transition Period" and conducted mobilization at the general meeting of all Party members. During the learning process, he regularly checked the learning situation and put forward suggestions for improvement. Comrades of the Party Group participated in or presided over various study seminars: Shen Shiru (Deputy Director and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group) assisted Deputy Director Li Shihao (Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party) in holding a study seminar for all technical personnel in the department and a seminar for members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party working in the department. Comrade Deng Linhua (Deputy Director and Secretary of the General Party Branch) presided over the study meeting for all the janitorial staff of the department and the study discussion meeting of the department's general group, and assisted the General Branch of the Communist Youth League in holding a study seminar for League cadres. These meetings greatly inspired the attendees. Under the guidance of the Party Group, the Party and League organizations of the department and its affiliated units promptly coordinated with the administration to make corresponding resolutions. Every Party member and League member formulated personal study plans, which also influenced and motivated the masses to formulate personal study plans.

The administrative leaders at all levels of the department also attached great importance to the implementation of the general line study. All departments organized forces to conduct repeated transmission and mobilization to their directly affiliated units, farms, silkworm seed farms, engineering offices, and survey teams, and organized and led the study of the staff of various directly affiliated units, so that all cadres and workers in the department were educated by the general line without exception.

Secondly, the principle of combining theory with practice was implemented in the learning process. At the beginning of the study, the leadership proposed that the mark of the general line study achievements was the improvement of work and the improvement of cadres' ideological level. Later, it was repeatedly pointed out at various meetings that the study of the general line must be closely linked to practice and carried out in-depth research on the basis of understanding the spirit of the documents. Responsible cadres (section, division, and bureau chiefs, etc.) adopted the method of thematic research by senior cadres in the Northwest Region, and proposed fifteen topics for personal thematic research and nine topics for departmental thematic research. At present, the topics being studied are being deliberated and materials are being collected from the bottom up. At the same time, the work conferences on secondary agricultural technical schools, water conservancy, aquaculture, farms, special products, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine held last winter and this spring, as well as the fifth agricultural work conference currently being held, have all studied the work in accordance with the spirit of the general line. Various bureaus, divisions, and sections have also summarized the work of last year according to the general line and determined the direction of future work. Everyone feels that the road is clear and the work is easier to do.

Thirdly, the senior group provides specific guidance to the intermediate and junior groups in their studies. Before each study session, the comrades participating in the senior group spent one hour going to the intermediate and junior groups to check the learning situation, help study the learning key points and methods, introduce the learning situation and learning experience of the senior group, and bring the problems of the intermediate and junior groups to the senior group for research, and then answer them. This method effectively promoted the study of the intermediate and junior groups.

Fourthly, in the entire learning process, in addition to the general plan, each unit of study also has a specific plan. The plan proposes the key points, requirements, time, and methods of learning for each unit, and organizes large classes for the intermediate and junior groups in a timely manner. A summary is made after each unit of study is completed. Attention is also paid to reporting and checking the learning situation on a regular basis.

Finally, strengthen ideological leadership in learning, constantly overcome various ideological obstacles, and correct learning attitudes. For example, before the Spring Festival, when studying the third unit, some cadres developed a sense of slackness and complacency, believing that "they had learned almost enough." To this end, the leadership promoted the group to check the study plan, launched criticism and self-criticism, and conducted a general test after the Spring Festival, which overcame ideological obstacles in learning.

    浙江省农林厅学习总路线的初步收获和经验
    中共浙江省人民政府农林厅总支委员会
    浙江省人民政府农林厅及其所属单位，于去年十一月初学习党在过渡时期总路线以来，干部的学习情绪很高。买理论书籍的人多了，晚上自修的人也多了。水利局图书馆里长期很少有人借理论书籍，这次理论书都被借光了。参加学习的同志大都制订了学习计划，工程局的同志除规定的学习时间外，都还利用业余时间进行自学。
    经过三个月的学习，全体工作人员普遍认识了总路线的基本内容。由于总路线的教育和鼓舞，干部的政治觉悟和工作积极性普遍提高。不少团员打报告给党支部，表示要以实际行动争取入党。不少青年群众也积极申请入团。工程局机械工作队修理组的工人，在一个半月内修好九辆汽车，使修理任务提前半个月完成。其他同志的工作效率也普遍提高了。实行粮食的统购统销后，不少家在农村的干部纷纷写信动员家庭出卖余粮。在这次购买经济建设公债中，也可以看出干部的政治积极性，全厅平均每人购买公债数目在三十万元以上。
    厅及其所属各单位，开始以总路线的精神，检查了工作。例如，厅机关农场处检查总结了一九五三年的工作，制订了一九五四年的工作计划，克服了以前工作中方向不明确、农场职工思想混乱以及有些农场经营管理不善的情况。畜牧兽医处召开了全省畜牧兽医工作会议和药品工作会议，确定了当前浙江省的畜牧兽医工作应以耕牛为主的方针，并要首先搞好国营企业和农业生产合作社中的畜牧工作。根据这一要求，该处现正在推广去冬开始以国营农场和合作社为基点搞冬季护畜工作的经验。此外，药品的浪费和医疗事故的发生也大为减少。水利局研究了如何在水利工作中保证社会主义经济成份的稳步增长，决定今年创办抽水机站十个，取得经验后，准备明年大量增设，以适应农业生产的需要和增加水利工作中的社会主义因素。
    三个月来学习成绩是比较显著的。取得这种成绩的主要原因，首先是由于领导上重视总路线的学习、在学习开始时进行了充分的动员工作。学习开始后不久，中共农林厅党组即决定把搞好干部总路线学习作为当前主要工作之一。厅长兼党组书记刘剑同志向全体干部作了“国家在过渡时期的总路线”的传达报告，又在全体党员大会上进行了动员。在学习过程中经常检查学习情况和提出改进意见。党组的同志曾分别参加或主持各种学习座谈会：沈石如（副厅长、党组副书记）协助李士豪副厅长（中国农工民主党浙江省工委会主任委员）开好了全厅技术人员学习座谈会与在本厅工作的农工民主党党员座谈会。邓林华同志（副厅长、党总支书记）主持了全厅勤杂人员学习大会和厅机关大组学习讨论会，并协助青年团总支开好了团的干部学习座谈会。这些会议使到会的人都受到很大的启发。在党组指导下，厅及所属各单位的党、团组织都及时配合行政作出相应的决议，每个党员、团员都订出个人学习计划，因而也影响和带动群众订出个人学习计划。
    厅各级行政领导对总路线学习的贯彻也很重视。各机关都组织力量向其直属单位、农场、蚕种场、工程处和测量队等进行了反复的传达动员，并组织和领导了各直属单位职工的学习，使全厅干部和工人都毫无例外地受到了总路线的教育。
    其次，在学习过程中贯彻了理论必须联系实际的原则。学习开始时，领导上即提出：总路线学习成绩的标志是工作的改进和干部思想水平的提高。以后在各种会议上又屡次指出，总路线的学习必须在弄通文件精神的基础上，密切联系实际，进行深刻研究。负责的干部（科、处、局长等）采取了西北区高级干部专题研究的方法，计提出个人专题研究的题目十五个，部门专题研究的题目九个。目前对所研究的题目，正在进行酝酿和自下而上的收集材料。同时，在去冬今春所召开的中等农业技术学校、水利、水产、农场、特产和畜牧兽医等工作会议，以及正在召开的第五次农业工作会议，都根据总路线的精神研究了工作。各局、处、科也根据总路线总结了去年的工作，并确定今后工作的方向。大家都感觉到：道路明确了，工作好做了。
    第三，高级组具体指导中、初级组的学习。参加高级组的同志在每次学习前抽出一小时分头到中、初级组去检查学习情况，帮助研究学习重点和学习方法，介绍高级组的学习情况和学习心得，并把中、初级组的问题带到高级组去研究，然后再给他们解答，这个方法有力地推动了中、初级组的学习。
    第四，在整个学习过程中，除有总的计划外，每个单元的学习也有具体计划。在计划中提出每一单元学习的重点、要求、时间和方法，并及时组织中、初级组上大课。每一单元学习结束后都进行小结。平时也注意汇报和检查学习情况。
    最后，加强学习中的思想领导，不断地克服各种思想障碍，端正学习态度。例如春节前在学习第三单元时，部分干部滋长了一种松懈、自满情绪，认为“学得差不多了”。为此，领导上即推动小组检查学习计划，展开批评和自我批评，并在春节后普遍进行了一次测验，这样就克服了学习中的思想障碍。
