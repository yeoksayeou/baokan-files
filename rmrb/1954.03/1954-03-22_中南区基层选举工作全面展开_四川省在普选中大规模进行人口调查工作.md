Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 20th—Large-scale grassroots election work has been gradually and fully launched in the Central-South region. Among the region's 75,000+ grassroots units, over 12,500 units, encompassing a population of approximately 30 million, have completed grassroots elections. Over 30,000 units, covering a population of approximately 70 million, comprehensively commenced elections in late February and early March. The remaining areas will soon follow. To strengthen leadership over grassroots elections, the Central-South Administrative Committee's Election Guidance Office recently dispatched working groups to provinces such as Henan and Hubei to conduct inspections and promote the healthy progress of the general election.

The areas in the Central-South region where grassroots election work is underway are quite extensive, including vast regions such as old revolutionary base areas from the Second Revolutionary Civil War, ethnic minority areas, island fishing areas, hometowns of overseas Chinese, and border areas. Before launching election work, all localities convened special meetings to make specific arrangements for the general election and dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to promote it. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 150,000 cadres have been dispatched in various localities across the region. Henan Province alone dispatched and trained 35,000 cadres to guide election work, conduct population surveys, and staff the general election people's courts.

The broad masses of voters are extremely enthusiastic during the general election movement. They regard participation in the election as the greatest joy of their lives and highly value their sacred electoral rights. Statistics from 36 townships in Tonggu County, Jiangxi Province, show that over 90 percent of eligible voters participated in the election, with some townships like Shiqiao and Yangxia reaching 100 percent. Many outstanding individuals who resolutely implement the general line, such as directors of production cooperatives, heads of mutual aid teams, and model agricultural laborers, have gained the trust and support of the voters and been honorably elected as people's representatives.

Grassroots election work in various parts of the Central-South region is being carried out in close combination with mutual aid and cooperation and spring plowing production while continuing to implement the general line education. Many areas have simultaneously launched spring plowing production and mutual aid and cooperation movements during the general election movement. In the Yuexi area of Guangdong Province, counties like Lianjiang, Suixi, Maoming, and Yangjiang have repaired 37 mountain ponds, 17 water slopes, and 12 water channels in 136 townships since the start of the general election. Another 38 mountain ponds are also nearing completion. Some farmers have increased their enthusiasm for participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement through the general election movement. Farmers in townships like Xiebu, Yangtian, and Xiagou in Echeng County, Hubei Province, spontaneously organized 225 mutual aid teams during the election.

Xinhua News Agency reported: Sichuan Province launched a large-scale population survey simultaneously with the unfolding of the general election movement.

Sichuan Province is one of the most populous provinces in China. According to population survey statistics from some areas, the population figures in various localities have continued to increase since liberation. For example, according to survey data from 17 townships in 17 counties such as Xinjin, the population survey figure for these 17 townships on July 1, 1953, was 144,981. Within the sixty days after this date, the absolute population increase in the 17 townships was 581. The population survey data also show that young and middle-aged laborers account for a high proportion of the total population. According to population survey statistics in Chengdu City, young and middle-aged people aged 18 to 45 account for 58 percent of the city's total population of over 747,000.

Since liberation, due to the improvement of people's lives, the improvement of sanitary conditions, and especially due to the promotion and implementation of the Marriage Law, happy marriages and harmonious families have continued to emerge, and the phenomenon of infanticide has been greatly reduced. Therefore, newborn babies account for a large proportion of the population. Population survey data from Nanbu County show that among the county's total population of over 789,000, 96,433 children were born after liberation, of which 29,561 were under one year old. If the population under the age of 18 is included, this new force in the county is more than 351,000, accounting for approximately 44 percent of the total population. All of these indicate that we have sufficient labor force and strong reserve talents for building socialism.

    中南区基层选举工作全面展开
    四川省在普选中大规模进行人口调查工作
    【新华社武汉二十日电】大规模的基层选举工作已在中南区逐步全面展开。全区七万五千多个基层单位中，除一万二千五百多个基层单位，约有三千万人口的地区已经完成基层选举外，有三万多个基层单位，约七千万人口的地区在二月底和三月初先后全面展开。其余地区不久也将展开。为了加强对基层选举的领导，中南行政委员会指导选举办公室已在日前派出工作组到河南、湖北等省进行检查，以便推动普选工作健康地进行。
    这次中南区展开基层选举工作的地区相当广阔，包括有第二次国内革命战争时期的革命老根据地、少数民族地区、海岛渔区、华侨家乡、边疆地带等广大地区。各地在展开选举工作前都召开了专门会议，对普选工作作了具体布置，同时派出了大批干部下乡推动普选。据不完全统计，全区各地先后抽调的干部将近十五万人。河南省便抽调和训练了指导普选工作和人口调查以及普选人民法庭干部三万五千人。
    广大选民在普选运动中情绪极为高涨。他们都把参加选举当作自己一生最大的喜事，对庄严的选举权利非常重视。江西省铜鼓县三十六个乡统计，参加选举的选民达到百分之九十以上，其中石桥、杨瑕等乡达到百分之百。许多坚决贯彻总路线的优秀人物如生产合作社社长、互助组长和农业劳动模范等都得到选民的信任和拥护，光荣地当选为人民代表。
    中南区各地的基层选举工作，是在继续贯彻总路线教育中密切结合互助合作和春耕生产工作进行的。许多地区在普选运动中同时展开了春耕生产和互助合作运动，广东省粤西区廉江、遂溪、茂名、阳江等县一百三十六个乡在开始普选以来，修好了山塘三十七个、水坡十七宗、水圳十二条，另有三十八个山塘也即将修理完成。有些农民经过普选运动提高了参加互助合作运动的积极性。湖北省鄂城县谢埠、杨田、夏沟等乡的农民在普选中自动组织了二百二十五个互助组。
    据新华社讯：四川省在普选运动展开的同时，展开了大规模的人口调查工作。
    四川省是我国人口最多的一个省份。根据部分地区人口调查统计材料证明，解放以来各地人口数字续有增加。如根据新津等十七个县的十七个乡调查材料看，这十七个乡一九五三年七月一日人口调查数为十四万四千九百八十一人，在这个时间以后的六十天内，十七个乡人口绝对增加数为五百八十一人。人口调查材料同时说明：青壮年劳动力在总人口数中占了很高的比例。成都市人口调查统计结果，全市七十四万七千多人口中，十八岁到四十五岁的青壮年占百分之五十八。
    解放以后，由于人民生活的提高，卫生条件的改善，特别由于婚姻法的宣传和贯彻，美满婚姻、和睦家庭不断出现，溺婴现象大为减少，因而人口中新生的婴儿占了很大的比重。南部县的人口调查材料说明，在全县七十八万九千多人口中，解放后出生的儿童有九万六千四百三十三人，其中不满一周岁的有二万九千五百六十一人。如果把十八岁以下的人口统计在内，这种新生的力量在全县有三十五万一千多人，约占总人口的百分之四十四。这些都说明了我们建设社会主义具有着充足的劳动力和雄厚的后备人材。
