     Messenger of the Heroic People
     By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Liu Guiliang
    In the victorious spring, the heroic Korean people dispatched glorious messengers—the Korean People's Delegation to China and the accompanying art troupe—to visit our country, bringing profound friendship and warm sentiments. This is the first visit to China by a Korean People's Delegation since the Korean armistice, and it is also the largest Korean People's Delegation to China in history.
    The representatives come from all parts of Korea, from the banks of the Yalu River to the 38th parallel, from Mount Kumgang to the west coast. The delegation includes representatives from various democratic parties and social organizations, combat heroes of the Korean People's Army, renowned labor heroes, model workers, model farmers, women representatives, youth representatives, scholars, writers, artists, journalists, cadres from government agencies and organizations, and religious figures. Among the representatives are Kim Dal-hyun, the 71-year-old deputy head of the delegation, and Park Chan-soo, the 21-year-old young combat hero and heavy machine gunner.
    In the days leading up to the delegation's departure, I had the opportunity to visit many of the representatives. During these visits, I was deeply impressed by the profound love and friendship the representatives held for the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Chairman Mao. In the words of the representatives, they all felt "indescribable excitement" at being able to visit "Chinese friends" in China. Among the representatives was a 39-year-old elder sister, Gu Fuli, a "support-the-front model." She told me that she had been entrusted by the villagers of Xinfeng Village, Changdao County, Gangwon Province, to talk to "Chinese friends" about many things. She wanted to ask "Chinese friends" how Chairman Mao and the Chinese people educated their outstanding children, the Chinese People's Volunteers. Choi ?, the Korean boy whose life was saved by the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, spoke eloquently about his "Chinese father" Luo Diekai's visit to his hometown of Shuocang Village, Seongcheon County, South Pyongan Province, on October 29th last year. He said that this time he must personally visit his Chinese father, Chinese mother, and younger siblings in Songshan Township, Xinhua County, Hunan Province. "Republic Hero" Liu Wanshu and Park Chan-soo both said that if they could see Chairman Mao, they would definitely tell him about their experiences fighting and living with the Chinese People's Volunteer comrades.
    Each representative received countless exhortations and instructions from thousands of comrades, relatives, and friends, asking them to send their regards and thanks to Chairman Mao and the entire Chinese people, and to visit the homes of the Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers and extend their heartfelt condolences to the families of the volunteers. Kim Eung-gi, the head of the delegation, said: "We will directly convey the Korean people's friendship and gratitude to the brotherly Chinese people, as well as their love and trust in the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers."
    The delegation brought valuable gifts carefully crafted by the Korean working people collectively. These included more than 50 banners, numerous letters of condolence, commemorative badges engraved with Marshal Kim Il-sung's image, and photographs of Marshal Kim Il-sung. The gifts also included Korean ginseng and deer antlers, unique Korean handicrafts such as exquisite patterned mats and smooth silk, spoons, bowls, and chopsticks made by People's Army soldiers from enemy shell casings, "frontline musical instruments" (including gayageum, violin, six-string guitar, flute, and drums), woodenware made from Mount Kumgang tree roots, large vases made by workers and farmers using special materials (with images of Chairman Mao molded from sparkling shells), desks and other stationery with Korean national characteristics, and various musical instruments. In addition, there were many valuable works of art, such as embroidered portraits and plaster statues of Chairman Mao, a satin product embroidered with the scene of the Chinese People's Volunteers helping Korean farmers with the autumn harvest, bronze statues sculpted by workers from the Hwanghae Ironworks depicting Korean and Chinese soldiers fighting side by side and Korean and Chinese workers building together, models of Korean national classical dances sculpted by students from Kim Il-sung University, and oil paintings depicting the image of the Chinese People's Volunteers internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao and the Korean People's Army "Matrosov-style" hero Li Shoufu.
    The most striking gift is a colorful folding screen with six panels embroidered by members of the Korean Democratic Women's League. The screen depicts the scenery of the world-renowned Korean scenic spot "Haegeumgang": the upper part shows the red sun rising in the east, the vast and boundless sea, towering and steep peaks, and rocks as strong as steel; the lower part shows pines, cranes, and deer, symbolizing longevity. The delegation will present this screen to Chairman Mao to express the Korean people's sincere wish for Chairman Mao's boundless longevity. Kang Hou-bong, the secretary-general of the delegation, said: "The characteristic of these gifts is not only that they are simple works of art collectively made by the working people, but also that they embody the sincere feelings of people from all walks of life in Korea."
    The delegation will vividly introduce countless heroic deeds of the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteers to the people of our country, because the delegation includes many outstanding individuals who have bravely fought and selflessly labored on the front lines of defending peace in the Far East and the world for the past three years.
    Republic Hero Liu Wanshu is an outstanding political deputy battalion commander (equivalent to a battalion instructor) of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army. He is 26 years old and comes from a poor peasant family. During the initial stages of the war, in the first counterattack by the Korean People's Army on July 14, 1950, when pursuing the American and Lee bandits to Gyeongsangbuk-do, he served as the political deputy company commander (equivalent to a company instructor) of a certain unit of the People's Army. At that time, he led two squads of warriors to attack "Height 256," defeating more than 800 enemy troops on the height with light weapons. In four hours, they occupied the height and then repelled 13 counterattacks by the enemy, annihilating 331 enemy troops. In the end, only three soldiers and himself remained in the two squads. Finally, they cleared the way for the main force to advance, and all four warriors were awarded the honorary title of "Republic Hero."
    The 21-year-old combat hero Park Chan-soo is the youngest representative in the delegation. On the day he turned 18, he gloriously joined the Labor Party, and at the end of last year, he was awarded the title of "Republic Hero." During the war, he and his comrades stood firm on the famous heroic height—"Height 1211," guarding the height like a copper wall. Park Chan-soo himself, in the six months leading up to the armistice last year, annihilated as many as 368 enemy troops (including 137 American soldiers) with his heavy machine gun in 56 battles, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of enemies annihilated by the entire platoon (926) during the same period. Three days before the armistice, on the morning of July 24, more than 50 enemy troops climbed up Jiaqifeng and launched a surprise attack, 33 of whom were shot dead by Park Chan-soo's heavy machine gun.
    Among the delegation is a labor hero, Kim Jikhyeon, whom you can tell at a glance is an old worker. He is 35 years old this year and has been a miner for 21 years. Since the age of 14, he has been a tunneling worker at the Aoji Coal Mine, the largest coal mine in Korea. After the "August 15th" liberation, he devoted all his wisdom and strength to the people's own coal mine. Before the war, during the war, and after the armistice, this hero continuously created new operating methods to improve labor productivity, continuously made contributions, and was continuously praised and rewarded by the government of the Republic. He was one of the 61 recipients of the "Merit Medal" awarded by the government of the Republic for the first time on the fourth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation in 1949. In October 1952, he created the "complex continuous blasting method," which increased productivity to four and a half times its original level, and was thus awarded the honorary title of "Labor Hero." After the armistice, he immediately devoted himself to promoting the coal mine's drainage work and took the lead in fighting selflessly to accelerate the recovery of the Aoji Coal Mine.
    "Support-the-front model" Gu Fuli is one of the four female representatives in the delegation. Her husband, Martyr Kim Bok-hwan, and three of her four sons were killed by American planes. She has a deep hatred for the American aggressors and the deepest friendship with the Korean and Chinese People's armies. She loves the Chinese People's Volunteers. When she mentions the benefits the Volunteers brought to the farmers of her hometown, Xinfeng Village, Changdao County, she talks enthusiastically without end. In fact, her selfless model deeds in supporting the Volunteers are equally endless. Over the years, she led the women of the entire village (she herself is the chairman of the Xinfeng Village Democratic Women's League) to boil countless kettles of water for the Volunteers, wash countless clothes, grind countless tofu, dig countless wild vegetables, and organized the women of the entire village to guard the graves of the Volunteer martyrs day and night amidst the gunfire. When her husband heroically sacrificed himself to protect the wounded Volunteers, she immediately lifted up the wounded and continued forward, and organized more stretcher bearers to serve the Volunteers, finally fulfilling her husband's will.
    The heroic model deeds of the representatives are endless. When the people of the motherland see these representatives, it is as if they are seeing the heroic Korean people. The arrival of distinguished guests from a heroic country will surely powerfully encourage the people of our country to more bravely advance victoriously along the bright road guided by the general line of the national transition period!

     英雄人民的使者
     新华社记者　刘桂梁
    胜利的春天，英雄的朝鲜人民派遣了光荣的使者——朝鲜人民访华代表团和随代表团同行的艺术团，带着深厚的友情和热烈的心意，到我国访问。这是朝鲜停战后朝鲜人民访华代表团第一次访问中国，也是历次朝鲜人民访华代表团中规模最大的一次。
    代表们来自朝鲜各地，从鸭绿江边到“三八”线，从金刚山到西海岸。代表里有各民主党派、各社会团体的人士，有朝鲜人民军战斗英雄，有著名的劳动英雄、模范工人、模范农民，有妇女代表、青年代表，有学者、作家、文艺工作者、新闻工作者，有机关、团体的干部，也有宗教界人士。代表中有七十一岁的老人副团长金达铉，也有二十一岁的年轻的战斗英雄重机枪手朴赞洙。
    在代表团出发之前的几天中，我得到机会先后访问了许多位代表。在访问中使我强烈地感到，代表们对中国人民，对中国人民志愿军，对毛主席的热爱和友情是那样的深厚。用代表们的话来说，他们都为能到中国来访问“中国亲友”而感到“无法形容的兴奋”。代表中有一位三十九岁的大嫂子——“支前模范”具富力。她告诉我：她受到江原道昌道郡新丰里乡亲们的委托，有一肚子话要和“中国亲友”们谈，她要问问“中国亲友”们：毛主席和中国人民是怎样教养出自己的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军的。伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教烈士舍身救活了的朝鲜少年崔?滔滔不绝地谈起他的“中国爸爸”罗迭开去年十月二十九日到他的家乡平安南道成川郡朔仓里访问的情景，他说这次他一定要亲自到湖南省新化县松山乡去看望他的中国爸爸、中国妈妈和弟弟妹妹们。“共和国英雄”柳万洙和朴赞洙都说：如果他能见到毛主席，他一定要向毛主席叙述他和志愿军战友们一起战斗一起生活的情形。
    每一位代表都受到成千上万的同志、亲人和朋友们的叮咛和嘱咐，要他们给毛主席和全中国人民捎个好，道个谢，一定要到志愿军指战员的家里去，对志愿军家属进行亲切的慰问。金应基团长说：“我们将向兄弟般的中国人民直接传达朝鲜人民对中国人民的友谊和感谢，对英雄的中国人民志愿军的热爱和信赖。”
    代表团带去了朝鲜劳动人民集体精心制作的贵重礼物。其中有五十多面锦旗，有许多慰问信，有镌刻着金日成元帅像的纪念章和金日成元帅的照片。礼物中还有朝鲜的珍贵土产人参和鹿茸，有朝鲜特有的手工艺品——精巧的花纹席和光滑的绸子，有人民军战士们用敌人的炮弹壳制作的羹匙、碗筷和“火线乐器”（包括伽倻琴、提琴、六弦琴、箫、鼓等）和用金刚山树根制作的木器，有工人和农民们用特殊材料精心制作的大花瓶（上面有用闪烁发光的贝壳塑成的毛主席像），具有朝鲜民族特色的书桌和其他文具以及各种乐器，此外，还有许多贵重的艺术品，如毛主席绣像和石膏塑像，一幅绣着中国人民志愿军帮助朝鲜农民秋收打场的缎制品，黄海制铁所工人们雕塑的朝中战士并肩作战和朝中工人并肩建设的铜像，金日成综合大学学生们雕塑的朝鲜民族古典舞的模型，描写朝中部队并肩作战和介绍朝鲜人民军“马特洛索夫式”英雄李寿福、中国人民志愿军国际主义战士罗盛教形像的油画。
    礼物中最为鲜明夺目的是：朝鲜民主妇女同盟盟员绣制的一座可以褶叠成六面的彩色屏风，屏风上绣着全世界闻名的朝鲜秀丽名胜“海金刚”的风景：上半部是东方升起的红色朝阳，辽阔无边的海面，挺拔峻峭的山峰和坚强如钢的岩石；下半部是像征长寿的松、鹤和鹿。代表团将把这面屏风献给毛主席，以表达朝鲜人民无比诚挚地祝毛主席万寿无疆的深情厚意。代表团书记长康候凤说：“这些礼物的特点，不仅在于它们是劳动人民集体制作的朴实的艺术品，而且在于它们体现了朝鲜各阶层人民的至诚心意。”
    代表团将会把朝鲜军民和中国人民志愿军数不尽的英雄事迹生动地介绍给我国人民，因为代表中包括了许多三年来站在保卫远东和世界和平最前哨英勇地战斗、忘我地劳动的优秀人物。
    共和国英雄柳万洙是朝鲜人民军某部一位优秀的政治副大队长（相当于营教导员），今年二十六岁，贫农出身。这位英雄在战争初期一九五零年七月十四日朝鲜人民军第一次反攻中追歼美李匪军到庆尚北道时，担任人民军某部政治副中队长（相当于连指导员），当时他带领两个分队（班）的勇士们攻打“二五六高地”，以轻武器击溃了高地上的八百多名敌军。在四小时内占领了高地，接着又打退了敌军十三次的反扑，歼灭了敌军三百三十一名。最后，两个分队只剩下了三位战士和他自己，终于为主力部队扫除了进军的障碍，四位勇士都获得了“共和国英雄”的光荣称号。
    二十一岁的战斗英雄朴赞洙是代表团中年轻的代表。他在满十八周岁那一天，光荣地加入了劳动党，去年年底又荣获“共和国英雄”称号。在战争中，他和他的战友们屹立在有名的英雄高地——“一二一一高地”上，把高地守卫得像铜墙铁壁一般。单是朴赞洙自己，就在去年停战以前的六个多月期间的五十六次战斗中，用他那挺重机枪歼灭敌军三百六十八名之多（其中美军一百三十七名），占全小队（排）在同一期间歼敌总数（九百二十六名）的三分之一以上。停战前三天，七月二十四日早晨，五十多名敌军爬上加柒峰，进行突然的袭击，被朴赞洙的重机枪扫射死三十三名。
    代表团中有一位劳动英雄金直铉，一看就知道他是个老工人。他今年三十五岁，已做了二十一年的矿工。他从十四岁起，就在朝鲜最大的煤矿——阿吾地煤矿做掘进工人。“八·一五”解放后，他把全部智慧和力量贡献给人民自己的煤矿。在战争以前、战争期间和停战以后，这位英雄不断创造提高劳动生产率的新作业法，不断立功，也不断受到共和国政府的表扬和嘉奖。他是共和国政府在一九四九年“八·一五”解放四周年第一次颁发“功劳奖章”时六十一位受奖者之一。一九五二年十月，他又创造了“复式连续爆破法”，把生产率提高到原来的四倍半，因而获得“劳动英雄”的光荣称号。停战以后，他又立刻全力推动煤矿的排水工作，带头为加速阿吾地煤矿的恢复事业而忘我斗争。
    “支前模范”具富力是代表团中四位女代表之一。她的丈夫金福焕烈士和四个儿子当中的三个都是被美机炸死的，她和美国侵略军有着血海深仇，和朝中人民军队有着最深厚的友谊，她热爱志愿军，提起志愿军对她的家乡昌道郡新丰里农民们的好处，她就热情地谈个不尽。其实，她忘我地支援志愿军的模范事迹同样是说不尽的。她几年来带动全里的妇女（她自己是新丰里民主妇女同盟委员长）为志愿军烧了多少开水，洗了多少衣服，磨了多少豆腐，挖了多少野菜，又组织全里妇女在炮火中不分日夜地守卫志愿军烈士墓。当她的丈夫为了掩护志愿军伤员而英勇牺牲的时候，她立刻抬起伤员继续前进，并且组织了更多的担架队员为志愿军服务，终于完成了她丈夫的遗志。
    代表们的英雄模范事迹是说不完的。祖国人民看到了这些代表，就等于看到了英雄的朝鲜人民。来自英雄国度的贵宾们的莅临，必将有力地鼓舞我国人民更加勇敢地循着国家过渡时期总路线所指引的光明大道胜利前进！
