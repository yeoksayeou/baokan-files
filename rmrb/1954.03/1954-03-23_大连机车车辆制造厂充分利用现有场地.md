    Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Makes Full Use of Existing Site
    Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is expanding production by making full use of existing sites.
    The production tasks of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant have greatly increased this year, and the demand for timber has more than doubled accordingly. In order to ensure timely drying of timber, the plant decided at the beginning of the year to expand the existing drying room by 94.4 percent.
    Later, the plant director and chief engineer summoned the Equipment and Power Section, the directors of relevant workshops, and experienced technical workers from the drying room to conduct a joint study. They carefully assessed the existing drying room and found that the effective usable area of the existing drying room only accounted for 55.3 percent of the total area. They decided to convert the non-operating areas into drying tunnel entrances. In this way, the existing drying room would be sufficient. This new plan is not only technically reasonable, but also saves more than 790 million yuan in expansion investment.

    大连机车车辆制造厂充分利用现有场地
    大连机车车辆制造工厂充分利用现有场地扩大生产。
    大连机车车辆制造工厂今年生产任务大大增加，所需木材也随之增加一倍多。该厂为了保证木材及时干燥，年初决定把现有的干燥室扩建百分之九十四点四。
    后来该厂厂长和总工程师召集了设备动力科、各有关的车间主任和干燥室的老技术工人来共同研究，对现有干燥室做了认真核算，结果发现现有干燥室有效的使用面积只占总面积的百分之五十五点三。他们决定把非作业面积都改成干燥洞口。这样，现有的干燥室就够用了。这个新方案不仅在技术上很合理，而且节约了七亿九千多万元的扩建投资。
