The military and civilians throughout the country must continue their unremitting struggle to crush any new enemy conspiracies.

The meeting heard Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's report on launching a mass land reform in 1954.

The meeting also adopted a policy toward puppet soldiers and puppet civil servants who defect from the enemy ranks and return to the embrace of the motherland.

    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府部长会议于三月中在胡志明主席主持下举行会议。
    越南政府发表的公报说：部长会议强调指出，召开日内瓦会议的决议是苏联和世界民主阵营和平政策的胜利，也是越南、高棉和寮国抗战的胜利。越南人民接连打击敌人，取得了胜利，使敌人遭到了严重损失，也加深了法国的政治危机和财政拮据。
    越南人民军总司令武元甲将军曾在会议上就这次冬春战役的军事形势作了报告。他指出了越南人民军在各个战线上所取得的胜利：人民军大量歼灭了敌军的有生力量；缴获了敌军的大量武器；推进了游击战；解放了几万平方公里的土地和数十万居民。武元甲将军同时指出：虽然敌人遭到了失败，他们还阴谋加紧活动。全国军民必须继续进行不懈的斗争，以粉碎敌人任何新的阴谋。
    会议决定写一封信，向全国战士、干部和为前线服务的民工们祝贺。
    会议听取了范文同副总理所作的关于在一九五四年发动群众实行土地改革的报告。
    会议还通过了对脱离敌人队伍回到祖国怀抱的伪军和伪公务人员的政策。
