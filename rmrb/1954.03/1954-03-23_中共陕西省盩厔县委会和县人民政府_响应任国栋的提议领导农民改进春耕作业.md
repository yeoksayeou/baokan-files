    The CCP Zhouzhi County Committee and County People's Government of Shaanxi Province responded to the proposal of Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CCP Guohou Banner Committee in Heilongjiang Province, to rural workers in various regions. Based on local conditions, they are seizing the leadership of spring plowing and improving spring plowing operations. This year's spring plowing in Zhouzhi County is generally five to ten days earlier than last year, and the quality of spring plowing operations has also significantly improved compared to previous years. The area of wheat fields with top dressing has increased by more than 10% compared to last year. Most of the land of the county's three agricultural production cooperatives has been plowed one to three inches deeper than last year. In order to further improve the quality of spring plowing operations, the county distributed Ren Guodong's proposal to various districts, instructing district-level cadres to study it carefully. Recently, the CCP Zhouzhi County Committee and the County People's Government, based on the spirit of Ren Guodong's proposal and the specific situation of the county, re-deployed the current spring plowing leadership. They established three strongholds in the county's ten districts, led separately by the Secretary of the CCP County Committee and the County Magistrate of the County People's Government. In addition, the agricultural technology guidance station dispatched six cadres to provide technical guidance at these three points. Cadres from the agricultural technology guidance station and cadres from the County People's Government formed a working group to specifically summarize the existing high-yield experiences of farmers throughout the county, so as to promote them in a planned manner during spring plowing. District and township cadres also have specific divisions of labor to carry out key leadership. The Second District established four key points in the district's twelve townships, led separately by the Secretary of the CCP District Committee and three others, and stipulated that each person should lead a key mutual aid team to promote the surrounding mutual aid and cooperation movement. Production competitions were also carried out between villages and groups in the district. Currently, about half of Zhouzhi County's 300,000 mu of wheat fields have been hoed once; most of the 500,000 mu of winter fallow land has also been plowed once, and some has been plowed twice. The 136,000 mu of cotton fields and more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields have been cleaned and loosened very thoroughly.

    中共陕西省盩厔县委会和县人民政府
    响应任国栋的提议领导农民改进春耕作业
    中共陕西省盩厔县委员会和县人民政府响应中共黑龙江省郭后旗委员会书记任国栋向各地农村工作者的提议，根据当地具体情况，抓紧春耕领导，改进春耕作业。盩厔县今年春耕一般比去年提前五天到十天，春耕作业的质量也比往年显著提高。全县施追肥的麦田比去年增加百分之十以上，全县三个农业生产合作社的土地大部比去年深耕了一寸到三寸。为了进一步提高春耕作业质量，该县曾将任国栋的提议印发各区，指示区级干部认真学习。最近，中共盩厔县委员会和县人民政府又根据任国栋提议的精神和全县具体情况，对当前春耕领导重新布置，在全县十个区建立三个据点，由中共县委会书记和县人民政府县长分别进行领导，另由农业技术指导站派遣六个干部在这三个点上进行技术指导。农业技术指导站的干部又和县人民政府的干部组织成一个工作组，在全县范围内专门总结农民已有的丰产经验，以便在春耕中有计划地加以推广。区、乡干部也具体分工，进行重点领导。第二区在全区十二个乡中建立了四个重点，由中共区委会书记等四人分别领导，并规定每人领导一个重点互助组，以推进周围的互助合作运动。该区村与村、组与组之间还开展了生产竞赛。现在盩厔县三十多万亩麦田已有一半左右锄过头遍；五十多万亩冬季休闲地也大部犁过头遍，部分犁过二遍。十三万六千多亩棉田和四万多亩稻田整理得非常干净和松软。
