Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory's New Machine Workshop

Promoting Non-Stop Shift Changes to Increase Equipment Utilization Rate

Workers at the New Machine Workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, by learning from the Soviet female worker Yamdarova's experience of non-stop shift handover, have greatly improved equipment utilization.

In the past, the New Machine Workshop would experience the following situation before each shift change: some lathes had already stopped turning, and the workers operating these machines were either changing clothes, tidying up tools, or wandering around, just waiting for the end-of-shift bell to ring before leaving the workshop. Most of these people would finish a task half an hour or twenty minutes before the end of their shift. If they were to put another piece on the lathe, it would often be near the end of their shift. Therefore, they simply wouldn't do it and would wait for the end of the shift. This was a great waste of working hours. There were also workers who, wanting to finish the last task before the end of their shift, would rush, compromising quality. After the shift change, because the next shift workers had to put pieces on the lathe, everyone needed the crane, and the crane couldn't handle it, so many lathes had to stop; thus, the lathe workers complained about the crane operators, asking why they didn't lift for them sooner. To solve this problem, the workshop added several more cranes, but it was still not enough.

This workshop recently learned from the Yamdarova work method, which changed this situation. Yamdarova is an advanced Soviet female worker, and her work method is that the previous shift workers should prepare everything for the next shift workers. Even if the previous shift workers cannot finish a task before the end of their shift, they should put the piece on and start working, so that during the shift change, there is no need to stop the machine, and the next shift workers can continue working. After the workshop implemented this method, the utilization rate of the lathes increased. The phenomenon of shutting down the machine half an hour or twenty minutes before the end of the shift and workers waiting for cranes after starting work no longer exists. Except for putting on and measuring pieces, the machine tools can run continuously. Secondly, because there is no need to rush before the end of the shift, and the requirements of the work are clearly explained during the shift change, the quality is guaranteed.

To ensure the implementation of this system, the workshop strengthened ideological education for the workers. In addition to regularly explaining the benefits of this approach to the workers at various meetings, each group also established a ten-minute meeting system to promptly conduct criticism and self-criticism to ensure the implementation of this system. Secondly, they formulated a day and night operation plan to ensure the timely supply of materials, enabling workers to produce continuously.

    推广不停车交接班的经验提高设备利用率
    大连机车车辆制造工厂新机器车间工人，学习苏联女工阎达罗娃的不停车交班接班的经验，大大地提高了设备利用率。
    过去，新机器车间每到交班以前，就出现这种情况：有的车床早已停止了转动，操纵这台床子的工人不是在换衣服、整理工具，就是到处遛跶，单等下班钟一响，就走出车间。这些人多半是在下班前半点或二十分钟时，干完了一个活，如果再往床子上把活，往往是把上干不多一会儿就到了下班的钟点。因此干脆就不干了，单等下班。这对工时的浪费是很大的。还有的工人因为想在下班前赶完最后一个活，就三刀当作两刀车，不能保证质量。而在交班后，因为下一班工人要往床子上把活，于是，你也要吊车，他也要吊车，吊车忙不开，很多床子就得停着；这样车床工人就埋怨吊车工人，为什么不早给他吊。为了解决这个问题，车间又增加了几个吊车，但是仍旧不够用。
    该车间最近学习了阎达罗娃工作方法，才改变了这种情况。阎达罗娃是苏联的先进女工，她的工作法是上一班工人要为下一班工人做好一切准备工作。虽然上一班工人在下班前不能干完一个活，也要把活把上，并开始工作，换班时，不需要停车，下一班工人接着干就可以。该车间这样做了以后，车床的利用率提高了。过去下班前半点钟或二十分钟就关车，工人上班后等吊车的现象，现在没有了。除了把活、量活以外，机床可以不停地转动着。其次，因为不用在下班前赶活，交班时讲明活的要求，质量就有了保证。
    为了保证这一制度的实行，该车间加强了对工人的思想教育工作。除经常在各种会上向工人说明这样做法的好处外，各小组还建立了十分钟碰头会制度，及时展开批评与自我批评，保证这一制度的贯彻。其次，他们制订了昼夜作业计划表，保证材料的供应及时，使工人能连续生产。
