The State Council Financial and Economic Committee Directs Basic Construction Units to Ensure Safety and Hygiene Preparations Before Construction

[This Newspaper News] The State Council Financial and Economic Committee issued instructions requiring all industrial departments to ensure that safety and hygiene preparations are completed before the start or resumption of basic construction projects.

The instructions pointed out: Based on past experience, relying solely on post-hoc inspections of construction site safety technology and labor protection work cannot meet the needs of safe construction; only by making preparations before construction and taking some necessary measures can safety technology and labor protection work better guarantee the completion of engineering tasks.

The instructions require units undertaking new construction projects to formulate a safety and hygiene measures plan while formulating a construction organization design or construction operation plan, or to include a safety and hygiene measures section in the construction organization design and construction operation plan. Safety and hygiene facilities must be one of the main items of construction preparation work. The main contents of safety and hygiene facilities should include the following: 1. Each construction site should prepare work sheds, dormitories, canteens, bathing places, toilets, drinking water, simple medical equipment, fire-fighting equipment, etc., according to needs and possibilities, and should meet safety and hygiene conditions; at the same time, it should contact health, trade, and cooperative departments in advance according to specific conditions to do as much as possible in the areas of epidemic prevention and hygiene for construction site workers, and the supply of daily necessities. 2. The poles, boards, etc., used for scaffolding should be inspected once before use, and those that are cracked, decayed, or do not meet specifications and cannot guarantee safety should be prohibited from use. 3. Protective equipment that must be used by various types of work should be prepared in terms of quality and quantity according to the prescribed standards; and a thorough inspection must be carried out before use. 4. Various mechanical and electrical equipment used on construction sites must be overhauled as soon as possible, and necessary safety protection devices should be installed. 5. Traffic and transportation routes and storage locations for building materials should be designated at the basic construction site. 6. All flammable and explosive materials should be stored in appropriate places and properly kept to ensure safety.

The instructions require units undertaking cross-year construction projects to do the following before resuming work: 1. For trenches, pits, and ditches without fixed wall supports, which have been eroded by freezing and rain, damaging the stability of the soil, if loose or cracked phenomena are found, appropriate treatment must be carried out in a timely manner to ensure safety. 2. In trenches, pits, and ditches with original fixed wall supports, if the supports are broken, bent, displaced, or sunken, replacement or reinforcement measures should be taken. 3. Units working under earthen cliffs and stone cliffs must properly handle any places on the cliffs that are in danger of collapse before work can begin; special attention should be paid to the fact that the weather is colder in the morning, the soil and rocks are frozen, and when the weather warms up in the afternoon, the ice melts and there is a danger of sudden collapse and falling, so patrol inspections should be carried out at all times to prevent accidents. 4. If wooden or bamboo frames erected for high-altitude operations are found to have unsafe phenomena such as sinking pillars, footboards, ramp boards, supports, crossbars, railings, etc., and ropes, iron wires, bamboo strips, and hobnails used at the connections are rotten, worn, or loose, they should be replaced or properly handled to ensure safety. 5. All tools and mechanical and electrical equipment must be inspected in detail before they are allowed to be used. 6. The original protective equipment must be inspected and sorted out in detail before it can be used, and it should be supplemented as needed. 7. Dormitories, work sheds, canteens, toilets, fire-fighting equipment, etc., should all be inspected, and if there is any damage, it should be reinforced or repaired; the construction site must be cleaned before construction can begin. 8. The storage location and management of flammable and explosive materials must be strictly inspected by engineering technicians and safety technicians to ensure safety.

The instructions require that units carrying out repair, modification, or demolition projects should have the responsible engineering and safety technicians conduct a detailed inspection and formulate a safe construction plan before construction can begin.

The instructions finally require that before starting or resuming work, the responsible personnel of construction units, whether for new construction projects or resumed projects, should personally organize engineering technicians, safety technicians, trade union cadres, etc., to conduct a comprehensive safety and hygiene inspection of the preparations for new construction projects or the resumption of projects before construction is carried out.

    政务院财经委员会指示基本建设施工单位
    施工前做好安全卫生准备工作
    【本报讯】　政务院财政经济委员会发出指示，要求各工业部门必须在基本建设工程开工或复工前，做好安全卫生准备工作。
    指示指出：根据过去的经验，建筑工地的安全技术劳动保护工作，单凭事后的检查，不能适应安全施工的需要；只有在施工以前做好准备，进行一些必要的措施，才能使安全技术劳动保护工作更好地保证工程任务的完成。
    指示要求担任新建工程施工的单位，在制订施工组织设计或施工作业计划的同时，制订安全卫生措施计划或在施工组织设计与施工作业计划中包含安全卫生措施部分。必须把安全卫生设施作为施工准备工作的主要项目之一。安全卫生设施的主要内容应包括下列几部分：一、各工地应根据需要与可能准备好工作棚、宿舍、食堂、沐浴处所、厕所、饮水以及简易医疗设备、消防设备等，并应合乎安全卫生条件；同时，应根据具体条件，事前与卫生、贸易、合作部门联系，尽可能地作好工地工人的防疫卫生及生活用品的供应等工作。二、对于搭设脚手架用的杆子、板子等，在使用前都应进行一次检查，对某些折裂腐朽或不合规格、不能保证安全者，应禁止使用。三、在工作中各工种必须使用的防护用品，都应在质量与数量上按规定的标准准备好；并须在使用前进行周密的检查。四、工地使用的各种机电设备，必须及早进行检修，并进行必要的安全防护装置。五、基本建设现场应划定交通运输线路及建筑材料的堆放地点。六、一切易燃性和爆炸性的物品，应存放在适当的地点并妥为保管，保证安全。
    指示要求担任跨年度工程施工的单位：在复工前要做到：一、在原无固壁支架的地槽、坑、沟、经过冰冻和风雨的侵蚀，破坏了土壤的稳定性，如发现疏松和裂缝等现象时，须及时作适当的处理，保证安全。二、在原有固壁支架的地槽、坑、沟，如其支架有折断、弯曲、走动和下沉等现象时，应作更换或加固措施。三、在土崖和石崖下工作的单位，崖上如有崩塌危险的地方，必须加以妥善处理后才能工作；应特别注意上午气候较冷，土石冻结，至下午气候转暖时冰冻化开，会突然发生崩塌坠落的危险，随时巡回检查，防止事故发生。四、高空作业搭设的木架或竹架，若发现柱子下沉，脚踏板、盘道板、支撑、横杆、栏杆等以及在连接处用的绳子、铁丝、竹篾、钯钉等有腐烂、磨损、松劲等不安全现象，都应更换或妥善处理，保证安全。五、一切工具及机电设备，须经详细检查，才准使用。六、对原有的防护用品，必须经过详细检查、整理才准使用，并应根据需要加以补充。七、对宿舍、工作棚、食堂、厕所、消防设备等，都应经过检查，如有损坏，应予加固或修理；施工前的现场必须进行清扫后始得开工。八、对易燃性及爆炸性物品的存放地点及保管情况，必须经工程技术人员和安全技术人员等进行严格的检查，以保安全。
    指示要求凡进行修补、修改或拆除工程的单位在施工前都应由负责工程的技术人员和安全技术人员进行详细检查，拟订安全施工计划后，始得施工。
    指示最后要求无论新建工程或复工工程的施工单位，在开工或复工前，都应由负责人员亲自动手，组织工程技术人员、安全技术人员、工会干部等，对新建工程的准备工作或复工工程，全面地进行一次安全卫生检查，再行施工。
