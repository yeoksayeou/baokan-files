    "Truth Daily" Publishes Article Exposing US Expansion of Indochina War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] TASS, Moscow, 22nd: "Truth Daily" published an article by I. Prischevsky, commenting on some facts about the United States' intention to expand the Indochina War.
    The author pointed out: More and more news recently published in foreign newspapers shows that the purpose of the US diplomatic community's activities on the eve of the Geneva Conference is not to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina and Korean issues, which the four major powers have already reached an agreement on in Berlin.
    Prischevsky wrote that some leaders in the United States would have no objection if the Geneva Conference were not held at all. Others, unwilling to bear the responsibility for sabotaging the conference, tried every means to prevent the issues facing the conference from being resolved. In fact, there can only be one explanation for the policy currently implemented by the American ruling group in Indochina: it wants to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference. The US diplomatic community is not only not working to establish peace in that part of Asia, but on the contrary, it is trying to expand the Indochina War.
    Prischevsky emphasized: According to foreign sources—including American sources—the United States is trying to make a desperate move to further expand the Indochina War. In addition, the American aggressors want others, first of all French soldiers and soldiers from Asian countries, to fight for them. As everyone knows, when the Republican Party came to power, President Eisenhower had already expressed his desire to use Asians to fight Asians. Currently, various measures are being taken to implement this policy.
    Prischevsky finally said: Therefore, many facts about US foreign policy cannot but attract the attention of peace-loving public opinion. Among these facts are the plans discussed in the newspapers for the United States to expand the Indochina War and turn it into a "United Nations War," the meeting held between the White House and General MacArthur, who is known to advocate the expansion of the Asian War, on the "Indochina situation," and Mr. Dulles's unfounded "inferences" that readers already know.

### “真理报”载文揭露美国扩大印度支那战争

    “真理报”载文揭露美国扩大印度支那战争
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”登载了伊·普利歇夫斯基的一篇文章，评论美国想扩大印度支那战争的一些事实。
    作者指出：最近外国报纸发表的越来越多的消息表明：在日内瓦会议召开的前夕，美国外交界的活动的目的，完全不在于争取和平解决印度支那和朝鲜问题，而这是四大国在柏林已经达成了协议的。
    普利歇夫斯基写道，如果日内瓦会议根本不举行，美国的某些领导人物倒是没有什么反对意见的。另外一些人不愿意负担破坏会议的责任，就千方百计地使会议所面临的问题得不到解决。事实上，对于美国统治集团目前在印度支那实行的政策只能有一个解释：它想在日内瓦会议上阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决。美国外交界不仅不努力在亚洲的那一部分建立和平，而且相反的，它还在设法扩大印度支那战争。
    普利歇夫斯基着重指出：据外国人士——包括美国人士在内——证实，美国企图孤注一掷，进一步扩大印度支那战争。此外，美国侵略者想要别人，首先是法国兵士和亚洲国家的兵士，为他们作战。大家知道，当共和党上台时，艾森豪威尔总统就已经表明了要用亚洲人打亚洲人的愿望。目前，正在采取各种措施来实现这个政策。
    普利歇夫斯基最后说：因此，关于美国外交政策的许多事实不能不引起爱好和平的公众的注意。在这些事实中，有报纸上讨论过的美国扩大印度支那战争并把它变为“联合国战争”的计划，白宫与大家都知道的主张扩大亚洲战争的麦克阿瑟将军就“印度支那形势”举行的会议，以及读者已经知道的杜勒斯先生的毫无根据的“推论”。
