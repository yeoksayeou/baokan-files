Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Worker Zhuang Minggeng
Completes Twenty-Five Months of Production Tasks in One Year
    Zhuang Minggeng, a worker at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Jiangsu Province, completed twenty-five months of production tasks in one year last year. This year, inspired and educated by Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation, he further developed his original work strengths. According to the new quota, he set out an advanced plan to complete seventeen months of production quota in one year.
    Zhuang Minggeng is a lathe worker in the mechanical workshop. Usually, as soon as the plan is determined, he actively uses his brain and explores the potential of machine equipment to ensure the completion of the task. In the past, the "cold wind cock" was made by two experienced masters. Sometimes it could not meet the needs of locomotive, passenger car and freight car repairs. Later, the leadership assigned this task to him alone. During production, he carefully inspected his work and found that in 480 minutes a day, only 240 minutes were the actual running time of the machine, and the rest of the time was wasted on measuring workpieces, sharpening knives, etc. He thought: If this continues, it will affect the departure of vehicles and delay the country's transportation plan. Therefore, he tried to draw two lines on the lathe carriage and install a check valve on the tool holder. After many experiments, he finally succeeded, and the work efficiency was more than doubled.
    Zhuang Minggeng attaches great importance to product quality and safety work. He knows that the "cold wind cock" is an important part of the vehicle brake. Its quality is directly related to the lives of millions of passengers and the wealth of the country. Therefore, he usually strictly abides by the operating procedures, operates carefully, and does not allow defective products to be produced. He also pays attention to the maintenance of the machine. In this way, the actual daily production time increased from 240 minutes to 400 minutes; the vehicle speed increased from 800 revolutions per minute to 1,035 revolutions per minute. In just one year, he completed twenty-five months of production tasks.
    In completing the national plan, Zhuang Minggeng is also good at arranging his work and does not waste any time. Every day, when he returns home, he always summarizes and recalls the work of the day, finds out the shortcomings, thinks of improvement methods, and then makes a plan for the next day. After going to work the next day, he first looks at the drawings clearly, distinguishes between the main and secondary, which one to turn first, and which one to turn later; and prepares the tools and materials in advance and places them in the most convenient place to take, so as to avoid wasting time. He has a great interest in new things and has no nostalgia or conservativeness for old things. The lathe tool used by lathe workers is generally thick at the cutting edge and shallow at the chip flute. They say "it is easy to burn the tool if it is not like this", but Zhuang Minggeng does not agree with this outdated statement. He thought about it again and again, and tried it again and again, and finally came to the opposite conclusion: the cutting edge should be thin and the chip flute should be deep. According to this conclusion, under the guidance and support of the workshop director Chi Yonghua, he successfully tested a new type of lathe tool. The new lathe tool is not only wear-resistant and durable, saving the time of changing tools, but also because the cutting edge is thin and the resistance is small, the cutting is deeper and faster.
    After Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds were published in the newspaper, Zhuang Minggeng was greatly encouraged. He said, "I will humbly learn from Wang Chonglun." Recently, Luo Liebao, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, proposed to all employees the call to "Learn from Wang Chonglun, complete the production plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, and strive for the early realization of socialist industrialization!" Zhuang Minggeng actively responded to this call. With the help of the trade union, he and lathe worker Zhuang Jinkui jointly improved the operation method, accelerated the feed speed, shortened the working hour quota, and set out an advanced plan to complete seventeen months of production quota in 1954. Now, he is working hard to achieve this plan.

    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂工人庄铭耕
    一年完成二十五个月的生产任务
    江苏省戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂工人庄铭耕，在去年一年内完成了二十五个月的生产任务；今年，他又在王崇伦生产革新精神的启发和教育下，进一步发扬了原有的工作优点，按照新的定额订出了今年一年内完成十七个月生产定额的先进计划。
    庄铭耕是机械车间的车床工人。平时，只要计划一确定，他便积极开动脑筋、挖掘机器设备的潜力来保证完成任务。车制“冷风考克”，过去由两个老师傅专门做，有时还是供应不上机车、客车和货车修理的需要，后来，领导上把这个任务交给了他一个人做。在生产中，他仔细检查了自己的工作，发现每天在四百八十分钟内，只有二百四十分钟是机器真正开动的时间，其余的时间都在卡量工作物、磨刀等上面浪费了。他想：照这样下去，就会影响车辆出厂，耽搁国家运输计划。因此他就想办法在车床拖板上划两根线，再在刀架上装一个止回器，经过多次试验，终于成功了，工作效率提高了一倍多。
    庄铭耕非常重视产品质量和安全工作。他知道　“冷风考克”是车辆制动器上的重要零件，它的质量好坏，是直接关系着千百万旅客的生命和国家财富的，所以他平时就严格地遵守操作规程，细心操作，不使产品出废次品。对待机器，也经常注意保养。这样每日实际生产时间由二百四十分钟增加到四百分钟；车速由每分钟八百转提高到一千零三十五转，只一年他就完成了二十五个月的生产任务。
    在完成国家计划中，庄铭耕还善于安排自己的工作，不浪费一点时间。每天，回到家里，他总要总结回忆一下当天的工作，找出缺点，想出改进办法，然后订出第二天的计划。第二天上工后，首先把图样看清楚，分清主要、次要，那件先车，那件后车；并把工具、材料事先准备好，放在取用最方便的地方，以免浪费时间。他对新鲜事物有极大的兴趣，对旧的东西则毫不留恋和保守。车床工人用的车刀，一般都是刀口厚、卷屑槽浅，他们说“不是这样的刀子就易烧坏”，可是庄铭耕却不同意这种陈旧的说法，他想了又想，试了又试，最后得出一个相反的结论：刀口要薄、卷屑槽要深。他按照这个结论，又在工场主任迟永华的指导与支持下，试验成功了一种新车刀，新车刀不但耐磨耐用、省去了换刀的时间，而且由于刀口薄、阻力小，吃刀也更深更快了。
    王崇伦的先进事迹在报上发表后，庄铭耕得到了很大鼓舞。他说：“我要虚心地向王崇伦学习。”最近，工厂党委书记罗烈保同志向全体职工提出了“学习王崇伦，提前与超额完成生产计划，争取社会主义工业化早日实现！”的号召，庄铭耕积极响应了这个号召。在工会的帮助下，他和车工庄金奎共同改进操作方法，加快走刀速度，缩短了工时定额，订出了在一九五四年内完成十七个月生产定额的先进计划。现在，他正在为实现这个计划而努力。
