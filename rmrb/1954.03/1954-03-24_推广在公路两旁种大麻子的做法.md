    Promoting the Practice of Planting Hemp on Both Sides of Highways

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received several letters from readers suggesting planting hemp on both sides of highways and roads to increase the production of oil crops. We have selected one of them for publication below. This practice of expanding the crop area by utilizing idle land is excellent. We hope that the agricultural departments of local people's governments will promote it under possible conditions. To avoid damage to highways and roads when planting hemp, we hope that the Highway Administration Bureau can formulate management measures to ensure that both oil crop production is increased and the roadbed is protected.

  The CCP Changping County Committee of Hebei Province, Guo Hanwen, writes: Hemp oil has a wide range of uses, serving both as industrial lubricating oil and for medicinal purposes. However, not many farmers in our county grow hemp. Generally, they only plant some along ditches or at the edges of fields, and rarely plant it on plots of land. Currently, it is the season for planting hemp. To meet the needs of industrial production, our county has conducted research and decided to promote the practice of planting hemp on both sides of highways and roads, expanding the planting area of hemp without affecting the production of other crops. For example, the highway from Changping to Shahe is twenty li long. If two rows of hemp are planted on both sides of the highway, it would be equivalent to expanding the planting area by six hundred mu, yielding at least one thousand two hundred shi of hemp. At the same time, the roots of hemp are very deep, and when grown on both sides of the road, they can also prevent the roadbed from being damaged by rain. Hemp can be planted by the road protection teams of the villages near the highway and the owners of the land alongside the road, who will then sell the hemp to the state after harvesting. This is a matter that benefits both the country and the farmers, and we hope that other regions will consider promoting it based on their specific circumstances.

### 推广在公路两旁种大麻子的做法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    推广在公路两旁种大麻子的做法
    编者按：最近，我们接到几封读者来信，建议在公路、道路两旁种植大麻子，以增产油料作物；现选择其中一件摘要发表在下面。这种利用闲地扩大作物面积的做法是很好的。希望各地人民政府的农业部门在可能的条件下加以推广。为了避免种植大麻子时损坏公路、道路，希望公路总局能制定出管理办法，以作到既增产了油料作物，又保护了路基。
  中共河北省昌平县委员会郭汉文来信：大麻子油的用途很广，既能作工业上的滑机油用，又可当药用。可是，我县农民种大麻子的并不多，一般只是在沟旁或地头种一些，很少有在成块地上种植的。目前正值种大麻子的季节，为了供应工业生产的需要，我们县里进行了研究，决定推广在公路、道路两旁种植大麻子的做法，在不影响其它农作物生产的情况下扩大大麻子的种植面积。如昌平至沙河的公路有二十里长，如在公路两旁种植两行大麻子，就相当于扩大种植面积六百亩，至少可收一千二百石大麻子。同时，大麻子的根扎得很深，长在路两旁，还可以使路基不易被雨水冲坏。大麻子可由公路附近村的各个护路小队以及路旁土地的所有者负责种植，收了麻子后卖给国家。这是一件既利于国家、又利于农民的事情，希望其它地区根据具体情况考虑加以推广。
