Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué on the military situation of the first half of March on the 17th. In the fifteen days from March 1st to 15th, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated 6,700 enemy troops in various parts of Vietnam, destroyed 106 enemy aircraft, and destroyed nearly 100 enemy armored vehicles and trucks.

The communiqué stated: From March 13th to the morning of March 15th, the Vietnam People's Army, in coordination with heavy artillery, launched attacks on the enemy's main positions in the northeast and north suburbs of Dien Bien Phu—Him Lam and Doc Lap Hill—completely annihilating two enemy European-African battalions. Enemy casualties amounted to approximately 1,300, including French Colonel Commander O’Chitte, two majors, and eight captains. At the same time, in the five days up to March 15th, the People's Army artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units shot down 27 enemy aircraft around Dien Bien Phu.

In the Red River Delta, on March 4th and 6th, in surprise attacks on the French military airfields of Gia Lam and Cat Bi near Hanoi and Haiphong, the People's Army destroyed 78 enemy aircraft. Destroying so many aircraft at a time when the enemy’s regular troops are dispersed on remote frontlines has created great difficulties for the enemy. The People's Army also launched a series of offensives against the French defense system on Highway 5, an important strategic highway connecting Haiphong and Hanoi, starting from March 11th, removing thirteen enemy strongholds and observation posts, destroying many bridges, highways, and railways, and hindering French transportation. In addition, the Vietnamese People’s Armed Forces conducted more than sixty raids, ambushes, and counter-sweeps, eliminating over a thousand enemy troops, removing twelve French strongholds, and shooting down one enemy aircraft, thereby expanding and connecting the guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases in the middle reaches of the Red River and on the right bank of the Red River.

At the same time, in close coordination with military operations on the main battlefields, guerrilla warfare in South and Central Vietnam has also intensified. In South Vietnam, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces launched several annihilating attacks and raids on French strongholds and observation posts, eliminating more than 500 enemy troops.

On March 7th, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in the Tuy Hoa area of ​​central South Vietnam destroyed 26 enemy trucks and annihilated an enemy European-African company. The enemy, believing that the Vietnam People's Army would not attack Dien Bien Phu, carried out an amphibious landing in Qui Nhon north of Tuy Hoa on March 13th, attempting to create some political influence and cover up their heavy defeats on various battlefields. The enemy's ill-timed landing in Qui Nhon will inevitably cause new difficulties for the enemy.

    越南人民军半月歼敌六千七百名
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部在十七日发表三月上半月军事形势的公报。越南人民军在三月一日至十五日的十五天中，在越南各地歼灭敌军六千七百名，毁敌机一百零六架，毁敌装甲车和卡车近一百辆。
    公报说：越南人民军从三月十三日到十五日晨在重炮配合下，对奠边府东北郊和北郊的敌军主要阵地——兴垄和独立高地发动进攻，全歼敌军两个欧非营。敌军伤亡约达一千三百人，其中有法军上校指挥官奥契特、少校二名和上尉八名。同时，在到三月十五日为止的五天中，人民军炮兵部队和高射炮部队在奠边府周围共击毁、击落敌机二十七架。
    在红河三角洲，三月四日和六日两天，人民军对河内、海防附近嘉林和吉碑法军机场的突袭中，击毁敌机七十八架。正当敌人的正规部队被分散部署在一些遥远的战线上的时候，击毁这样多的飞机，为敌人造成了很大的困难。人民军并从三月十一日起对连接海防和河内的重要战略公路——第五号公路上的法军防御体系发动了一连串的进攻，拔除了十三处敌军据点和了望塔，破坏了许多桥梁、公路和铁路，妨碍了法军的交通运输。此外，越南人民武装进行了六十多次奇袭、伏击和反扫荡战，歼灭敌军一千余名，拔除法军据点十二处，击落敌机一架，从而扩大并连结了红河中游与红河右岸地区的游击区和游击基地。
    同时，为了密切配合主要战场上的军事行动，南越和中越的游击战也加紧了。在南越，越南人民武装对法军据点和了望塔发动了数次歼灭性的攻击和奇袭，歼敌五百多名。
    中越南部绥和地区的越南人民武装在三月七日击毁敌军卡车二十六辆，歼敌一个欧非连。敌军以为越南人民军不会进攻奠边府，三月十三日在绥和以北的归仁实行两栖登陆，妄想这样来造成一些政治影响，并掩饰他们在各战场上的惨重失败。敌军在归仁的不合时机的登陆，必将使敌人遭到新的困难。
