    【Our Newspaper】 Since November of last year, major and medium-sized cities, and most small cities across the country, have successively implemented planned grain supply according to the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, receiving enthusiastic support from the broad masses of people. A new atmosphere of normal grain sales and market stability has emerged everywhere.
    Planned grain supply is a new economic and political measure of the state. Therefore, all cities conducted thorough preparations before implementation. Generally, specialized institutions were established to lead this work, investigations and studies were conducted on grain consumption, and grain storage, transportation, processing, and variety adjustment were strengthened. At the same time, the policy of planned grain supply was widely publicized and educated among cadres and the masses through various means, combining it with the General Line. In the seven districts within Beijing, 15,000 people were involved in publicizing to residents, and nearly 2,000 people reported to their units in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, construction departments, and government offices and schools. Starting from October 30th last year, the whole city basically achieved universal awareness within three days. After understanding that implementing planned grain supply could provide the grain needed for people's livelihoods and national construction at prices stipulated by the state, avoid exploitation by speculative merchants, and stabilize prices, the broad masses of people expressed enthusiastic support. The masses in various places generally reflected that after the state planned the grain supply, they no longer worried about rising grain prices, not being able to buy grain, or grain merchants adding adulterants. Everyone's life became stable, and national construction could proceed smoothly. The broad masses of people in Beijing and other places enthusiastically supported the method of rationing flour, saying, "You have to think of a rainy day even on a sunny day; this method of a steady flow of water is really good!" "The government really knows how to manage household affairs for the people!"
    When implementing planned grain supply, various cities have stipulated simple and easy-to-implement supply methods based on local people's consumption habits and levels. Except for certain varieties that are rationed, the supply of other coarse and fine grains is determined by residents based on their actual needs. They purchase grain from state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private merchants who sell grain on behalf of state-owned companies with their grain purchase certificates. For the grain needed by the cooked food industry and the food industry, various places generally determine a standard for supply based on their actual turnover. To facilitate grain purchases by the masses, various places have generally begun to gradually divide supply areas and adjust supply points based on the distribution of residents, and the national grain departments entrust cooperatives, retail companies, or private grain consignment stores to conduct supply in sections.
    While implementing planned grain supply, all cities have also carefully handled the private grain industry in accordance with the Government Administration Council's order on the implementation of planned grain purchase and planned supply and the Interim Measures for the Management of the Grain Market. All localities have announced that private grain businesses are not allowed to operate grain privately, and the existing grain stocks of private grain merchants have been registered. Most private grain processing industries and retailers are entrusted by the national grain departments to process and sell or distribute grain under the strict management and supervision of the state. The state has tried to help grain merchants who need to change careers. The national grain departments in some cities have also employed some employees and individual capitalists from the private grain industry after review, based on needs and possible conditions. The employees of the private grain industry were all overjoyed and determined to supervise the capitalists to do a good job in processing and consignment work; most capitalists also expressed satisfaction with the state's handling and arrangements.
    Various cities have achieved good results in implementing planned grain supply. Before the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain in Beijing, due to speculative merchants purchasing grain for hoarding or transporting it out of the area, the flour sold by the national grain department within four months reached 60 percent of the annual supply volume. After the implementation of planned grain supply, the grain supply situation has returned to normal. After Chongqing implemented planned grain supply, the sales volume of various types of grain decreased by 12 to 23 percent, and the grain sales volume in Wuwei, Gansu, decreased by 40 percent. The national grain sales volume in November of last year decreased by 1.64 percent compared to October, of which flour decreased by 20.52 percent. In the past, due to the influence of speculative merchants, grain prices in some areas were chaotic. After the implementation of planned grain supply, grain prices have stabilized. Due to the sufficient grain supply and stable market, the lives of urban residents in various places have become more stable. Han Gentang, an old worker at the Pingyuan Machine Factory in Xinxiang City, Henan Province, said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about our lives, we must work hard to improve production!"

    广大人民拥护粮食统销政策
    各城市粮食计划供应效果很好
    【本报讯】从去年十一月份起，全国各大、中城市和大部分小城市，根据中央人民政府政务院的命令，先后实行了粮食计划供应，获得广大人民的热烈拥护。各地普遍呈现粮食销售情况正常、市场稳定的新气象。
    粮食计划供应是国家的一项新的经济和政治措施，因此各城市在实行以前，都进行了周密的准备工作。一般都成立了领导这一工作的专门机构，对粮食消费情况进行了调查研究，加强了粮食储运、加工和粮食品种的调剂工作。同时，通过各种方式，将粮食计划供应的政策结合总路线，在干部、群众中进行了广泛的宣传教育。北京市城内七个区，对居民宣传的人员达一万五千人，国营工矿企业、建筑部门和机关、学校等对本单位作报告的人员近两千人；从去年十月三十日开始，在三天的时间内，全市基本上达到家喻户晓。广大人民了解到实行粮食计划供应，可以按照国家规定的价钱供应人民生活和国家建设所需要的粮食，可以避免投机奸商的剥削和稳定物价的道理以后，都表示热烈拥护。各地群众普遍反映：由国家有计划地供应粮食以后，一不担心粮食涨价，二不担心买不到粮食，三不担心粮商掺假掺杂，大家生活安定了，国家建设可以顺利进行。北京等地广大人民热烈拥护面粉定量供应的办法，他们说：“晴天得想着阴天，这样细水长流的办法真好！”“政府真会替老百姓管家务！”
    各地城市实行粮食计划供应时，都根据当地群众消费习惯、消费水平等，规定了简便易行的供应办法。除某些品种定量供应外，其它粗细粮食供应，均由居民根据自己的实际需要，凭购粮证向国营公司、合作社和为国营公司代销粮食的私商购买粮食。对于熟食业、食品工业所需的粮食，各地一般都按其实际经营额确定一个标准进行供应。为了便利群众购粮，各地一般都根据居民分布的情况，开始逐步划分供应区，调整供应点，由国家粮食部门委托合作社、零售公司或私营粮食代销店分片进行供应。
    在实行粮食计划供应的同时，各城市都根据政务院关于实行粮食计划收购和计划供应的命令以及关于粮食市场管理暂行办法，对私营粮食业进行了慎重的处理。各地都宣布私营粮食业一律不准私自经营粮食，并对私营粮商的存粮进行了登记。大部分私营粮食加工业和零售商，在国家严格的管理和监督之下，由国家粮食部门委托加工和代销、经销粮食。对于需要转业的粮商，国家都设法予以帮助。有些城市的国家粮食部门并根据需要和可能的条件，对私营粮食业的部分职工及个别资本家，经过审查后予以录用。私营粮食业的职工都欢欣鼓舞，决心监督资本家搞好加工、代销工作；大部分资本家也对国家的处理、安置表示满意。
    各城市实行粮食计划供应已收到良好的效果。北京市在实行粮食统销以前，由于奸商套购粮食，进行囤积或外运，国家粮食部门四个月内销出的面粉，达全年准备供应量的百分之六十，实行粮食计划供应后，粮食供应情况已经正常。重庆市实行粮食计划供应后，各粮种销售量减少了百分之十二到二十三，甘肃武威粮食销售量减少百分之四十。全国去年十一月份粮食销售量比十月份减少百分之一点六四，其中面粉减少了百分之二十点五二。过去因受奸商投机的影响，部分地区粮价出现紊乱现象，实行粮食计划供应后，粮价已经稳定。由于粮食供应充足、市场平稳，各地城市居民生活更加安定。河南省新乡市平原机器厂老工人韩根堂说：“毛主席对咱们的生活这么关心，咱们一定要努力把生产搞好！”
