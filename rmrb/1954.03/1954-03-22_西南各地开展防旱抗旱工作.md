Southwest China Carries Out Drought Prevention and Resistance Work

Party committees and governments in various parts of Southwest China are actively leading farmers in repairing water diversion and storage projects and carrying out water lifting and irrigation work to reduce the threat of drought and ensure timely rice transplanting.

In recent months, rainfall and snowfall have been scarce in the Southwest region, and river and lake water levels have fallen. Water storage in ponds, dams, and winter paddy fields has been low. The drought situation in Chuxiong, Yiliang, Yuxi, Dali, Mengzi and other regions of Yunnan Province is relatively serious, and spring crops in some areas have already withered. In Sichuan Province, the amount of water stored in winter paddy fields in Leshan and Neijiang regions has also decreased compared with the past, which cannot guarantee rice transplanting. In response to this situation, various localities have taken drought prevention and resistance measures. Since the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy work conference held in Yunnan Province in early February, various localities have focused on drought prevention and resistance and spring repairs of water conservancy projects. To date, various localities have achieved considerable results. For example, the farmland water conservancy project constructed in Yao'an County, Chuxiong Region, has increased the county's water storage by more than 30% compared with the same period last year, which can guarantee that 60% of the paddy fields can be transplanted on time. Chuxiong County has already saved more than 10,000 mu of withered spring crops. In Yuxi Region, 70% of the ponds and dams have been closed to store water, increasing water storage by half compared to last year. In Dali Region, 90% of the ponds and dams have been closed to store water. Sichuan Province has also widely mobilized the masses to vigorously pump water to irrigate fields in areas with water sources, and continue to repair ponds and dikes in areas lacking water sources. Since late January, Pengxi, Anyue, Lezhi, Santai and other counties in Suining Region have started the construction of more than 50 new ponds. After these ponds are repaired, they will not only ensure water for spring plowing, but also expand the planting area. Farmers in Neijiang Region are repairing collapsed and leaky ponds and dikes, and most of them can be repaired before spring plowing. Farmers in Guizhou Province are also building and repairing farmland water conservancy projects to prevent drought and ensure a bumper harvest.

In order to vigorously support farmers in resisting drought and ensure full planting, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces have successively dispatched 15 work teams to drought-stricken areas to specifically help farmers prevent and resist drought. The Yunnan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has also supported drought resistance work with a large number of wooden waterwheels and more than 80 newly established drought-resistant pumping machines. The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government is studying with relevant departments to prepare to supply some of the machinery needed for pumping irrigation in Southwest China to enhance the current drought resistance strength and lay the foundation for the future development of pumping irrigation.

    西南各地开展防旱抗旱工作
    西南各地党和政府积极领导农民整修引水蓄水工程、开展提水灌溉工作，以减除干旱威胁，保证适时插秧。
    近几月来，西南地区雨雪稀少，河湖水位低落，塘坝及冬水田蓄水不久。云南省楚雄、宜良、玉溪、大理、蒙自等专区旱象比较严重，个别地区小春作物已经枯萎。四川省乐山、内江专区的冬水田蓄水量也比过去减少，不能保证插秧。针对这一情况，各地都已采取了防旱抗旱措施。云南省自二月上旬召开农林水利工作会议以后，各地即以防旱抗旱、开展水利春修为主要工作，到目前为止，各地都已取得不小成绩，如楚雄专区姚安县兴修的农田水利工程使全县蓄水量比去年同时增加了百分之三十多，已可保证百分之六十的稻田能按时插秧，楚雄县已将一万多亩枯萎的小春作物救活。玉溪专区百分之七十的塘坝都关了水，蓄水量比去年增加一半。大理专区关上水的塘坝已达百分之九十。四川省也普遍发动群众在有水源的地方大力车水灌田，水源缺乏地区继续整修塘堰。遂宁专区的蓬溪、安岳、乐至、三台等县自一月下旬以来已动工新修的塘就有五十多口，这些塘修好后，不但可以保证春耕用水，还可扩大部分栽插面积。内江专区农民正在整修垮漏塘堰，春耕前大部可以整修完毕。贵州省农民也都在新修补修农田水利工程，预防干旱、保证丰收。
    为了大力支持农民抗旱，保证满栽满插，云南、四川两省已先后派出十五个工作组，分赴旱情较重地区具体帮助农民防旱抗旱，云南省水利局并以大批木水车及新办的八十多部防旱抽水机支援抗旱工作。中央人民政府水利部正在和有关部门研究，准备供应西南地区部分抽水灌溉需用的机器，以增强目前抗旱实力，并为今后发展抽水灌溉事业打下基础。
