Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 5th: Young and middle-aged men among the displaced civilians stranded in South Korea are universally forced to concentrate and receive military training. Those who are physically strong are later forcibly incorporated into the Rhee puppet army. An Yongji, a displaced civilian youth who returned on the 2nd, was forced to receive four months of military training in a Rhee Syngman army training institution called "Education Corps" on Geoje Island.

An Yongji said: The headquarters of this "Education Corps" is located in Geoje City, Geoje Island. Branches are also set up in Tongyeong, Busan, Daegu, and other places, specializing in "absorbing" North Korean men aged between seventeen and forty-five. The "Education Corps" is entirely organized according to the Rhee puppet army's establishment, divided into regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, etc. Each battalion has about 3,500 people. The so-called instructors are all Rhee puppet army officers. The head of the "Education Corps" announced to everyone at the beginning: "After you ‘graduate’ in the future, you will all join the ‘National Defense Army’."

An Yongji also said: We were forced to do more than five hours of military drills every day, and sometimes we had to practice night emergency assembly and rapid marching. In addition, we had to do three or four hours of hard labor every day. We ate moldy coarse rice, without vegetables, and each person was given a little bit of salt. Sometimes they also gave some seaweed, which caused our whole bodies to swell after eating it. Many people died of exhaustion or illness.

In April 1951, the head of the "Education Corps" announced that the pre-training period was over. An Yongji and some others were dismissed from the "Education Corps" because of their physical weakness. About 2,000 young people in their battalion, aged between 20 and 27, were detained for further training. Later, An Yongji wandered to Busan. In the spring of 1952, he met some people in Busan who had previously been trained in the "Education Corps." They had all been forced to join the Rhee puppet army. They told An Yongji that after they were kept behind, they were trained for another month, and then they were forced to be incorporated into the Rhee puppet army and transferred to Busan, Daegu, and other places for garrison duty.

Before An Yongji was about to leave Busan to return to his hometown this time, they all said to An Yongji with tears in their eyes: The hateful Syngman Rhee dragged us into a pit of fire. Now we can no longer return to our hometown as civilians. Please be sure to tell our family members: We are all still alive, and one day we will return.

    李承晚匪帮把大批失所平民强编入伪军
    【新华社开城五日电】流落在南朝鲜的失所平民中的青壮年男子普遍被迫集中受军事训练，其中身体强壮的后来就被强制编入李伪军。二日回来的失所平民青年安永吉就曾被迫在巨济岛的一个名为“教育队”的李承晚军训机构受了四个月的军事训练。
    安永吉说：这个“教育队”的本部设在巨济岛巨济市，另外在统营、釜山、大邱等地都设有分部，专门“吸收”年在十七岁以上四十五岁以下的北朝鲜男子。“教育队”完全按照李伪军的编制，分联队、大队、中队、小队等。每大队有三千五百人左右。所谓教员全是李伪军军官。“教育队”的负责人一开始就向大家宣布：“你们将来‘毕业’后就全部参加‘国防军’。”
    安永吉又说：我们被迫每天作五小时以上的军事操练，有时还要演习夜间紧急集合和快速行军。此外，每天还要做三四小时的苦工。我们吃的是发霉的糙米饭，没有菜，每人给一点点盐巴，有时也给一些海草，吃了全身浮肿。很多人都累死或病死了。
    一九五一年四月，“教育队”的负责人宣布预训时间已满。安永吉和另外一些人因身体衰弱被遣散出“教育队”，和他们在一个大队的约两千名年在二十岁到二十七岁的青年被扣留下来继续训练。以后安永吉流浪到釜山。一九五二年春他曾在釜山碰到以前同在“教育队”受训的一些人，他们都已经被迫参加了李伪军。他们告诉安永吉说，他们留下来以后，又训练了一个月，就被迫编入李伪军，调往釜山、大邱等地驻防。
    这次安永吉将要离开釜山回家乡来以前，他们都曾流着泪对安永吉说：可恨李承晚把我们拖入火坑，现在我们已经不能作为平民回乡了，请你千万告诉我家里人：我们都还活着，将来总有一天我们要回去的。
