Xinhua News Agency, March 28th: Jiang Nan, a commentator for this agency, comments: As the Geneva Conference approaches, the general public, concerned about the peaceful resolution of pressing issues in Asia and the easing of international tensions, notes the gap between the propaganda rhetoric and actual actions of U.S. officials, who bear a significant responsibility for the success or failure of the conference.

After the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference, the American ruling group continuously spread pessimistic sentiments, predicting the failure of the Geneva Conference. This argument, besides exposing the United States' ulterior motives in seeking peaceful resolutions in Asia through consultation, thus subjecting itself to condemnation by world public opinion, had no other effect. Therefore, the U.S. authorities now find it necessary to change their tune, whitewashing themselves as lovers of peace while shifting the responsibility for the "hot war" and "cold war" that the United States is intensifying in Asia onto others. In a dispatch from Washington on the 24th, the official United States Information Service (USIS) stated that the United States is concerned about "restoring peace and security in Korea and Indochina" and concerned about the "unity and free self-government" of "relevant Asian peoples," supposedly some of the U.S.'s "basic objectives" at the upcoming Geneva Conference. The USIS also said that the United States, "in approaching the conference, intends to keep every door open that might lead to a peaceful settlement." While the USIS was affixing these golden labels to U.S. policy, it resorted to its old tricks, slandering the Soviet Union and the Chinese people, and saying that "Communist military forces should withdraw within their own borders," attempting to reverse the facts and bite back, in order to shift the responsibility onto others when the United States obstructs the smooth progress of the Geneva Conference.

But the "talent" of American propagandists cannot withstand the test of facts. The USIS had just said on the 24th that they would keep every door open in Geneva that leads to a peaceful settlement, and on the 28th, this same news agency announced a statement from U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson that completely contradicted this. Robertson said: "We do not intend to make dangerous or fatal concessions to the Communists at the Geneva Conference." People know that since the Berlin Conference, important figures in the United States have been expressing in various ways that peace is unfavorable to the United States, and that a ceasefire in Indochina and achieving a peaceful resolution is dangerous and fatal. Therefore, Robertson's so-called refusal to make "dangerous or fatal concessions" actually means that he does not intend to let the Indochina war stop, or let the issue be resolved peacefully.

The United States' attempt to reverse the facts, bite back at others, and shirk responsibility is futile. People want to ask: Is it not the United States, but someone else, that has openly announced that it wants to maintain a "dominant position" in Asia with a "policy of strength" in order to enslave the Asian people? Is it not the United States, but someone else, that is building a vast network of military bases in a large area of Asia, establishing a so-called "arc-shaped military defense line" including Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Indochina, Taiwan, and Japan to encircle China and the Soviet Union, and dispatching American aggressor troops from across the Pacific to Asian countries more than 10,000 kilometers away from the U.S. border? Is it not the United States, but someone else, that is sending military delegations and training puppet armies everywhere in order to "use Asians to fight Asians" to realize the United States' aggressive plans? It is very obvious that even according to the most absurd logic, Indochina, Korea, Japan, and the vast area of Asia cannot be included within the "borders" of the United States, but in fact, the United States is acting precisely on this premise. It is precisely because of this that the United States, more than 10,000 kilometers away from Asia, has caused many unnecessary "difficulties," as the U.S. Information Agency calls them, in resolving Asian issues, and the U.S. Information Agency is now emphasizing these "difficulties" in order to block the road to a peaceful resolution.

Everything is already clear: the U.S. authorities talk loudly about "restoring peace in Korea and Indochina" and "respecting" the "freedom" and "independence" of the relevant Asian peoples, but in reality, they are doing their utmost to prevent the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and are doing their utmost to prevent Asians from gaining freedom and independence. On the one hand, the United States is encouraging Syngman Rhee to clamor against the Geneva Conference and put forward various absurd conditions regarding the Geneva Conference, in an attempt to obstruct the progress of the conference in order to maintain the "stalemate" of the Korean armistice; on the other hand, it is announcing that the U.S. goal in Indochina is to step up combat and achieve "military victory" in order to prevent the people of Indochina from obtaining peace, independence, and freedom.

The Asian people and the people of the world have seen all these stark facts and drawn the necessary conclusions from them, believing that the olive branch held in the mouths of American propagandists is inconsistent with America's war and warmongering actions, and that these statements about "peace," "freedom," and feigning "innocence" cannot cleanse the face of the United States and make people believe that the United States is truly willing to resolve issues peacefully.

### 美国阻挠亚洲和平的责任是推卸不掉的

    美国阻挠亚洲和平的责任是推卸不掉的
    【新华社二十八日讯】本社评论员江南评论：随着日内瓦会议会期的日益临近，关心和平解决亚洲迫切问题与缓和国际紧张局势的广大公众，注视到对会议成败负有重要责任的美国官方的宣传辞令与实际行动之间的鸿沟。
    柏林外长会议以后，美国统治集团不断散布悲观空气，预告日内瓦会议的失败。这种论调除了暴露出美国对协商谋求亚洲和平问题别有用心，从而使自己遭受到世界舆论的谴责以外，没有产生任何作用。因此，现在美国当局认为有必要变换一下调子，把自己粉饰成和平的爱好者，而把美国正在加紧进行的亚洲的“热战”和“冷战”的责任推给别人。官方的美国新闻处在二十四日从华盛顿发出的电讯中，表示美国关心“恢复朝鲜和印度支那的和平与安全”，关心“有关的亚洲人民”的“统一和自由的自治”，据说这是美国在未来日内瓦会议上的一些“基本目的”。美国新闻处还说美国“在对待会议时，要使每一个可能通向和平解决的大门都保持畅开”。美国新闻处一面替美国政策挂上这些金字招牌，一面重施故技，诬蔑苏联和中国人民，并说什么“共产党的军事力量应撤退到他们自己的疆界以内去”，企图颠倒事实，反咬一口，以便美国阻挠日内瓦会议的顺利进行时，把责任推在别人身上。
    但是美国宣传家的“才能”经不起事实的考验。美国新闻处刚在二十四日说他们要在日内瓦使通向和平解决的每一个大门都畅开，二十八日这个同一新闻处就宣布美国国务院助理国务卿罗伯逊与此完全相反的声明。罗伯逊说：“我们不打算在日内瓦会议上向共产党人作危险的或致命的让步。”人们知道，自柏林会议以来，美国的要人们就在用各种方法表示和平对美国不利，表示在印度支那停战、取得和平解决是危险的、致命的。因此，罗伯逊所谓不作“危险的或致命的让步”，实际上就是不打算让印度支那战争停止，让这个问题和平解决。
    美国想颠倒事实、反咬别人来推卸责任，是徒然的。人们要问：彰明较著地宣布要以“实力政策”在亚洲保持“支配地位”以奴役亚洲人民的，难道不是美国而是别人？在亚洲广大地区修建庞大的军事基地网，建立包括土耳其、伊朗、巴基斯坦、印度支那、台湾和日本在内的所谓“弧形军事防线”来包围中国和苏联，从太平洋彼岸派遣美国侵略军队到远在美国疆界一万多公里以外的亚洲国家来的，难道不是美国而是别人？派遣军事代表团、到处训练傀儡军队以便“用亚洲人打亚洲人”来实现美国的侵略计划的，难道不是美国而是别人。很显然，即使根据最荒唐的逻辑也不能把印度支那、朝鲜、日本和亚洲广大地区都包括在美国的“疆界”以内，而事实上，美国正是按照这个前提来办事的。正因此，所以远离亚洲一万多公里以外的美国，就使亚洲问题的解决，发生了许多不应有的美国新闻处所谓的“困难”，而美国新闻处现在又来强调这些“困难”，以便挡住和平解决问题的道路。
    一切都已经了若指掌，美国当局口头上大谈其“恢复朝鲜和印度支那的和平”和“尊重”有关的亚洲人民的“自由”、“独立”，实际上却在竭力阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决与印度支那和平的恢复，竭力阻止亚洲人获得自由和独立。美国一面鼓励李承晚叫嚣反对日内瓦会议、提出种种关于日内瓦会议的荒谬条件，以图阻塞会议的进行来保持朝鲜停战的“僵局”；一面宣布美国在印度支那的目标是要加紧作战，取得“军事胜利”，以便阻止印度支那人民获得和平、独立和自由。
    亚洲人民和全世界人民看到了所有这些尖锐的事实并从其中得出了应有的结论，认为美国宣传家们口里衔着的橄榄枝是和美国的战争与好战的行动不相称的，认为这些关于“和平”“自由”与装作“无辜”的声明，不可能洗净美国的面目，使人相信美国真正愿意和平解决问题。
