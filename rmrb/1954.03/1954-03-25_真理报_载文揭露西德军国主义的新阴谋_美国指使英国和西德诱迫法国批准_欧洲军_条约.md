"Pravda" Article Exposes New Conspiracy of West German Militarism
    US Instructs Britain and West Germany to Induce France to Approve "European Army" Treaty
    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: TASS Moscow reported: "Pravda" published an article by its Berlin correspondent Naumov, entitled "West German Militarists are Seeking New Allies." The author wrote: Currently, as the idea of collective security increasingly penetrates the minds of Western Europeans, American diplomats and their Western European followers are frantically attempting to salvage their policy of dividing Europe into mutually opposed military blocs. West German newspapers have recently been clamoring, attempting to prove that there seems to be no other way to develop European international relations except to establish a military bloc with the participation of German militarism.

    Naumov continued, recently, West German newspapers have been particularly fanatical in talking about a plan to establish a military bloc with the participation of Britain, West Germany, Spain, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. According to reports, if the "European Defense Community" treaty ultimately fails, this new group of countries will replace the old group of six Western European countries. Apparently, this new American plan is to the liking of West German militarists. It attracts them because it would allow them to control not only the whole of Western Europe but also the southern Balkans and the Near East.

    In recent years, West German monopoly capitalists have firmly established themselves in the markets of Greece and the Near East, squeezing out Britain and other countries. Encouraged by these initial victories, West German monopoly capitalists today openly demand the re-implementation of Wilhelm II's policies. Everyone knows that Wilhelm II wanted to control the Near East by building the Berlin-Baghdad Railway. As Adenauer has recently been visiting Greece and Turkey, talk about this new plan to open the doors of the Near East for West German monopoly capital has become even more heated. It is said that the Bonn Chancellor conducted secret negotiations with government figures in Greece and Turkey to discuss "common defense issues," which "may become pressing once the European Army collapses."

    Naumov concluded: All the clamor in Bonn, Ankara, and Athens once again illustrates that as long as the policy of dividing Europe, establishing military blocs, and pitting some European countries against others is implemented, the security guarantee of Europe will inevitably be undermined. Only by establishing an all-European system that guarantees European collective security can aggressive forces be contained.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: TASS Paris reported: According to Reuters, a British Foreign Office spokesman said on the evening of the 21st that Britain has begun discussing with France and the other five countries participating in the "European Army" the issue of Britain's relationship with the "European Army."

    However, the British Foreign Office representative declined to provide any more specific details, only pointing out that the discussions concerned "guarantees" that some French parliamentarians demanded as an exchange condition for ratifying the "European Army" treaty.

    Parisian journalists believe that the British spokesman's statement, as well as Adenauer's recent visit to Paris, are related to the pressure that the United States is exerting on the French ruling group to get France to approve the "European Army" treaty as quickly as possible.

    Everyone knows that resolving the Saar issue is a condition put forward by some French parliamentarians for ratifying the "European Army" treaty, so Adenauer came to Paris on the orders of the United States, wanting to make people believe that he was willing to promote the resolution of this issue. However, Agence France-Presse reported on the 22nd that negotiations between France and West Germany on the Saar issue had reached a deadlock and had been suspended. "Le Monde" said: This situation "is giving the Americans a headache."

    “真理报”载文揭露西德军国主义的新阴谋
    美国指使英国和西德诱迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”刊载了该报驻柏林记者瑙莫夫的一篇文章，标题是“西德军国主义者正在寻求新的同盟者”。作者写道：目前，当集体安全的主张日益渗入到西欧人的脑子中去的时候，美国的外交家及其西欧的信徒们正在疯狂地企图挽救他们把欧洲分裂为一些互相对立的军事集团的政策。西德报纸最近大肆喧嚷，企图证明除了建立有德国军国主义参加的军事集团以外，似乎就没有、也不可能有发展欧洲国际关系的其他途径。
    瑙莫夫接着说，最近，西德报纸特别狂热地在谈论建立一个有英国、西德、西班牙、希腊、南斯拉夫和土耳其参加的军事集团的计划。据各报说，如果“欧洲防务集团”条约最后破产的话，将由这一新的国家集团代替旧的六个西欧国家的集团，看来，美国这一新的计划是投合西德军国主义者的口味的。它之所以能吸引他们，是因为这不仅可以使他们能控制整个西欧，而且能控制巴尔干南部以及近东。
    近年来，西德垄断资本家已牢固地在希腊和近东的市场上扎了根，排挤了英国和其他国家。西德垄断资本家在这些初步胜利的鼓励下，今天已公开地要求再度实行威廉二世的政策。大家知道，威廉二世想通过建筑柏林—巴格达铁路来控制近东。由于阿登纳最近正在访问希腊和土耳其，关于替西德垄断资本打开近东大门的这一新计划的谈论已经更加热烈。据说，波恩总理与希腊及土耳其的政府人物进行秘密谈判，讨论的是“共同防御问题”，这些问题“一旦在欧洲军破产时，就可能成为迫切的问题了”。
    瑙莫夫最后写道：波恩、安卡拉、雅典的一切喧嚷再一次说明，只要一天实行着分裂欧洲、建立军事集团以及使一些欧洲国家对抗其他欧洲国家的政策，欧洲的安全保障就不可避免地要遭到损害。只有建立起保障欧洲集体安全的全欧体系，才能遏止侵略势力。
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：据路透社消息，英国外交部发言人在二十一日晚上说：英国已经开始和法国及参加“欧洲军”的其他五个国家商谈英国和“欧洲军”的关系问题。
    但是，英国外交部的代表拒绝发表任何更具体的情节，只是指出：商谈的是一些法国议员要求作为批准“欧洲军”条约的交换条件的“保证”问题。
    巴黎新闻界人士认为：英国发言人的声明以及最近阿登纳的访问巴黎，都和美国为了促使法国赶快批准“欧洲军”条约而向法国统治集团施加的压力有关。
    大家知道，解决萨尔问题是法国一些议员所提出的作为批准“欧洲军”条约的条件，因此阿登纳奉美国之命到巴黎来，想使人认为他愿意促进这个问题的解决。但是，法新社在二十二日报道，法国和西德关于萨尔问题的谈判已经陷入僵局，而且已经中断了。“世界报”说：这种情况“使得美国人很伤脑筋”。
