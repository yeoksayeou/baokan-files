Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Thirty-eight major factories and mines in the capital exceeded February's national output value plan by 6.3%, with the best completion rate of any February since liberation. Compared with February of last year, the total output value of thirty-six of these factories and mines (two factories had not yet been established at that time) increased by 65.6%. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant exceeded the state plan for pig iron by 3.99%, coke by 3.64%, and cast iron pipes by 14.57%. The Fengtai Bridge Factory, which is rushing to produce steel beams, cement pipe piles, and square piles for the Han River Bridge of the Yangtze River Bridge, the Wei River Bridge of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and other projects, completed the entire month's production plan on the 26th. The North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory's rocker-arm harvesters, three-tooth light weeding hoes, and eight-inch walking plows all completed their production plans ahead of schedule. The Qinghe Woolen Mill also overfulfilled its production plans for woolen fabrics, serge, and yarn products. In addition, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the People's Machine Factory, the Second Machine Tool Plant, and the Xinhua Printing Plant all exceeded February's production plan by 3% to 14%.

In the capital, workers have significantly improved their class consciousness by studying the general line of the state's transition period. Many factory and mine workers included ensuring normal attendance as part of their labor competition during the Spring Festival period, changing the situation in previous years where February's production plan was severely affected by decreased attendance due to the Spring Festival. In previous years, the Jingxi Mining Bureau failed to complete its production plan every February due to excessive absenteeism around the Spring Festival; this February, the attendance rate of employees throughout the bureau remained above 95%, so they not only exceeded the production plan by 13%, but also increased the average daily output and tunneling progress by more than double compared to February of last year. In the process of completing February's production plan, many factory workers strengthened their overall concept, cooperated with each other, and overcame many difficulties. For example, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's No. 1 blast furnace had difficulty producing No. 1 foundry iron, reducing pig iron production by more than 300 tons in a week. The workers of No. 2 blast furnace, who had more experience in producing foundry iron, took the initiative to request exchanging product varieties with the workers of No. 1 blast furnace, ensuring the completion of the pig iron task. To ensure the completion of the national production plan for February, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of various factories and mines checked the implementation of the production plan on a daily or ten-day basis. For example, the general branch committee of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory went to the main workshops every morning from 8:00 to 9:00 to understand the completion of the previous day's production plan, helped the branch offices of each workshop study the production situation, and then held coordination meetings, submitting problems to the administration for timely resolution. In addition, the administrative departments of various factories and mines took various effective measures with the completion of February's plan as the center. For example, based on last year's experience, the Jingxi Mining Bureau carried out a major overhaul of the roadways in early February, eliminating various obstacles affecting the completion of February's production plan, improved the underground transportation system in the Chengzi Coal Mine, and transferred fifty-one workers to direct production.

Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, March 3rd: Sixteen of Tangshan City's seventeen major factories and mines, including Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan Steel Plant, Tangshan Power Plant, and Huaxin Textile Factory, completed or exceeded February's production plan. Among fifteen important products, except for silica bricks which were not counted, the other fourteen all completed or exceeded February's output plan, with coal completing 101.9%, steel ingots 104.8%, steel 103%, power generation 109%, cotton yarn 100.94%, and cotton cloth 100.95%.

Other indicators were also completed relatively well. For example, the Tangshan Power Plant completed the coal consumption, plant power consumption rate, and fuel cost plan. The quality of important products such as coal, steel ingots, steel, cement, cotton cloth, and cotton yarn in the city also met national requirements.

Maintaining normal attendance after the Spring Festival played a significant role in completing February's production plan in various factories and mines in Tangshan City. February coincided with the Spring Festival, and the idea of taking a break among workers and the absenteeism after the Spring Festival have always been very serious. Last February, due to high absenteeism, only five of the seventeen major factories and mines completed the full month's plan. In order to reverse this situation, the Tangshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees of various factories and mines conducted in-depth mobilization and education work. After being educated on the general line, the workers also realized the importance of balanced completion of the plan. Therefore, on the first day of work after the Spring Festival, the attendance rate of workers in thirteen factories maintained the level before the Spring Festival, and the attendance rate of six factories was even better than before the Spring Festival, with some factories achieving full attendance. In February, the attendance rate of each factory and mine was generally around 95%.

### 北京唐山许多厂矿完成上月计划

    北京唐山许多厂矿完成上月计划
    【新华社三日讯】首都有三十八个主要厂矿超额百分之六点三完成了二月份国家产值计划，完成的情况比解放以来任何一年的二月份都好。和去年二月份比较，其中三十六个厂矿（有两个厂当时还没有成立）的生产总值增加了百分之六十五点六。石景山钢铁厂生铁超过国家计划百分之三点九九，焦炭超过百分之三点六四，铸管超过百分之十四点五七。正在给长江大桥的汉水桥、宝（鸡）成（都）铁路渭水桥等工程赶制钢梁、水泥管桩、方桩的丰台桥梁工厂，在二十六日就完成了全月生产计划。华北农业机械总厂的摇臂式收割机、三齿轻便耘锄和八吋步犁都提前完成了生产计划。清河制呢厂毛呢、哔叽、毛线类产品也都超额完成了生产计划。此外，琉璃河水泥厂、人民机器厂、第二机床厂、新华印刷厂等，都超额百分之三到十四完成了二月份生产计划。
    首都职工在学习国家过渡时期总路线中，阶级觉悟有显著提高，许多厂矿工人在春节前后都以保证正常出勤作为劳动竞赛的内容之一，改变了历年二月份因为春节出勤率下降而严重影响生产计划完成的情况。京西矿务局往年由于春节前后缺勤太多，每逢二月份都完不成生产计划；今年二月全局职工出勤率一直保持在百分之九十五以上，因此不仅超额百分之十三完成了生产计划，而且平均日产量和掘进的进度都比去年二月提高了一倍多。许多工厂职工在完成二月份生产计划中，加强了整体观念，互相协作，克服了完成计划中的很多困难。如石景山钢铁厂一高炉生产一号铸造铁有困难，一周就减产生铁三百多吨，二高炉过去生产铸造铁较有经验，该炉职工就主动要求和一高炉职工互换产品品种，结果保证了生铁任务的完成。在保证完成二月份国家生产计划中，中共北京市委和各厂矿党委，都按日或按旬检查生产计划的执行情况。如华北农业机械总厂党总支委员每天早晨八时到九时，都到各主要车间了解头一天生产计划完成情况，并帮助各车间支部研究生产情况，然后召开碰头会，发现问题就及时提交行政解决。此外，各厂矿行政方面都以完成二月份计划为中心，采取了各种有效措施。如京西矿务局根据去年经验，在二月初进行了巷道大检修，扫除了影响二月份生产计划完成的各种障碍，并在城子煤矿改进了井下运搬系统，抽出五十一个工人转入直接生产。
      【新华社唐山三日电】唐山市开滦煤矿、唐山钢厂、唐山发电厂、华新纺织厂等十七个主要厂矿，有十六个完成或超额完成了二月份的生产计划。十五种重要产品中，除矽砖未统计外，其它十四种都完成或超额完成了二月份的产量计划，计煤完成百分之一百零一点九，钢锭完成百分之一百零四点八，钢材完成百分之一百零三，发电量完成百分之一百零九，棉纱完成百分之一百点九四，棉布完成百分之一百点九五。
    其它各项指标也完成得比较好。如唐山发电厂的煤耗、厂用电率和燃料成本计划都完成了。全市的煤、钢锭、钢材、水泥、棉布、棉纱等重要产品的质量，也都达到了国家的要求。
    唐山市各厂矿工人在春节后保持正常出勤，对完成二月份生产计划起了很大作用。二月份赶上春节，工人中的歇年思想和春节后的缺勤情况，历来是十分严重的。去年二月份因缺勤多，十七个主要厂矿中完成全月计划的就只有五个。中共唐山市委和各厂矿党委为了扭转这一情况，曾深入进行了动员教育工作。职工们经过总路线教育，也认识到均衡完成计划的重要，因此，春节后开工的当天，十三个厂工人的出勤率都保持春节前的水平，其中有六个厂的出勤率比春节前还好，有的厂子做到全勤。总计二月份内各厂矿出勤率一般都在百分之九十五左右。
