    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet in Honor of the Visiting Delegation of the Korean People

    Respected Leader and all members of the Visiting Delegation of the Korean People, Comrades of the Art Troupes:

    On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend a warm welcome to all comrades of the Visiting Delegation of the Korean People headed by Leader Kim Ung-ki, from our heroic neighbor, and through you, pay lofty respect to the people of the glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Under the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army defeated the American aggressors and achieved the great victory of the Korean Armistice. This victory has guaranteed the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China, and safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people have become the glorious banner for all oppressed countries and peoples in their struggle for independence and freedom, and have won the respect of progressive mankind throughout the world.

    At present, the Korean people are stepping up the restoration of the national economy and rebuilding a peaceful life. With the assistance of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Korean people, through selfless and creative labor, will surely achieve brilliant success in implementing the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy in Korea.

    I believe that this enthusiastic visit of the Visiting Delegation of the Korean People and the outstanding performances of the art troupes will greatly inspire the Chinese people and further develop and consolidate the militant friendship and close unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples. The strength of this friendship and unity is a powerful guarantee for peace in the Far East.

    Comrades, friends: Let us toast to the growing strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union! To the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples! To the victory of the heroic Korean people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification of Korea and their achievements in the cause of restoring the national economy! To the health of Marshal Kim Il-sung!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    敬爱的朝鲜人民访华代表团团长和全体代表同志们，各艺术团的同志们：
    我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民谨向来自我们英雄邻邦的、以金应基团长为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎，并通过你们，向光荣的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民致以崇高的敬意。
    朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，在中国人民志愿军的援助下，战胜了美国侵略者，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。这一胜利，保障了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国的安全，保卫了远东和世界的和平。朝鲜人民已成为一切被压迫国家和人民争取独立、自由的光荣旗帜，并获得全世界进步人类的尊敬。
    现在，朝鲜人民正在加紧恢复国民经济，重建和平生活。在以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的援助下，朝鲜人民以忘我的、创造性的劳动，必将在实施朝鲜恢复和发展国民经济的三年计划中取得光辉的成就。
    我相信，朝鲜人民访华代表团这次的热情访问和各艺术团的卓越演出，将使中国人民获得极大的鼓舞，并将使中朝两国人民的战斗友谊和亲密无间的团结更加发展和巩固。这种友谊和团结的力量就是远东和平的有力保证。
    同志们，朋友们：让我们为以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的日益强大干杯！为中朝两国人民的永久友谊干杯！为英雄的朝鲜人民争取和平统一朝鲜的胜利和在恢复国民经济事业中的成就干杯！为金日成元帅的健康干杯！
