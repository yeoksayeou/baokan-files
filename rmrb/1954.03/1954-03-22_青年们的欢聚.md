    A Gathering of Youth
    The afternoon sun shone softly on the open space in front of the Communist Youth League Central Committee office building. Unlike the usual quiet scene, today two long rows of people were lined up here, waiting for the arrival of the distinguished guests – the youth representatives of the Korean People’s Delegation to China. Around three o'clock, the distinguished guests arrived. Amid flowers and applause, they were welcomed into the conference room of the new building.

    The symposium began in a very cordial and harmonious atmosphere. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, and Kim Jin-taek, Deputy Director of the Education Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, expressed their profound friendship and high respect for each other in their speeches. Then, individual conversations began. On one side, Park Chan-soo, a hero of the Republic, was introducing his heroic deeds to the comrades of the Communist Youth League Central Committee. Although the language barrier hindered fluent conversation, when he mentioned "1211" Highland – the place that the heavily damaged American invading army heartbreakingly called "Heartbreak Ridge" – everyone understood, and they couldn't help but carefully examine this hero, who was only twenty years old but had created an amazing miracle, with admiring eyes. Opposite them, Comrade Hu Yaobang was talking with Li Yong-ho, Deputy Head of the delegation and Commander of the Navy of the Korean People's Army. What people found curious was: Why did they not need an interpreter? It turned out that this naval commander had fought side by side with Chinese comrades against the Japanese imperialist invasion on Chinese soil. Between the Changbai Mountains and the Black River in Northeast China, he and many of his compatriots had left behind footprints of battle and records of victory. From his weathered face, people could sense the long and arduous years of battle he had endured. Republic hero Liu Wanshu’s conversation with a Chinese “Young Pioneer” was particularly touching. This Young Pioneer – Cui Jinrong – who was invited to meet the Korean youth representatives, brought with her today the diary of her brigade. This brigade diary, carefully bound with colored paper, reflected a corner of our motherland's rich and colorful life. It not only recorded the activities of their brigade day, but also contained a message from Volunteer Army hero Cui Jianguo, and today, on its new page, Republic hero Liu Wanshu left them an encouraging message: "Study hard, exercise, and strive to defend the motherland!"

    People chatted freely, like old friends catching up. Seeing such a scene, it was difficult to determine whether they were new acquaintances or old friends reuniting after a long separation.

    At four o'clock in the afternoon, it was the Communist Youth League Central Committee's break time for exercises. The symposium took a temporary break. The distinguished guests were invited to join the young friends of the Communist Youth League Central Committee in a get-together. With the collective dance music broadcast from the loudspeaker, people took light steps, jumping and embracing. At this time, everyone realized that two of the female comrades in the delegation were dancers and singers, so, amid warm applause, they were immediately invited to perform songs and dances on the spot. Afterwards, everyone sang equally familiar songs in different languages: "The Changbai Mountains are continuous,..." After one song, another followed. In the singing of "Unity is Strength," the young people of China and Korea held hands and stepped forward in circles. Finally, Republic heroes Liu Wanshu and Park Chan-soo were lifted high by the people.

    …The symposium continued. The clock on the wall quickly pointed to six o'clock, and the time for parting arrived. People held their friends' hands tightly with reluctance, as if to pour all their friendship into each other.

  　青年们的欢聚
    午后的阳光柔和地照射在团中央办公楼前的空地上。和往常静寂的景象不同，今天这里排列着两行长长的人群，在等待着贵宾们——朝鲜人民访华代表团青年代表的到来。三时左右贵宾们来到了。在鲜花和掌声中，他们被迎到了新楼的会议室里。
    座谈会在十分亲切的、融洽的气氛中开始了。团中央书记处书记胡耀邦和朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会教养部副部长金辰泽在自己的讲话中，分别表达了彼此的深厚友情和崇高敬意。接着，开始了个别的交谈。这一边，共和国英雄朴赞洙在向团中央的同志们介绍自己的英雄事迹。虽然语言的不同妨碍了畅谈，但当他说到“一二一一”高地——就是那个被受到重创的美国侵略军伤心地称为“伤心岭”的地方——的时候，人们就全部懂得了，于是都不禁怀着钦佩的眼光再来仔细端详一番这位年仅二十而却创造了惊人奇迹的英雄。在他们的对面，胡耀邦同志和代表团副团长、朝鲜人民军海军司令官李永镐娓娓地交谈着。人们奇怪的是：他们为什么用不到翻译？原来这位海军司令官曾在中国土地上和中国同志们并肩反抗过日本帝国主义的侵略。在我国东北的白山黑水之间，他和他的许多同胞们都曾留下过战斗的足迹和胜利的纪录。从他的饱经风霜的脸上，人们可以测知他所度过的艰苦漫长的战斗的岁月。共和国英雄柳万洙和一个中国“红领巾”的交谈是特别动人的。这位被邀来和朝鲜青年代表见面的少年先锋队员——崔晋荣，今天还随身带来了她们中队的日记本。这个用彩纸精心装订起来的中队日记本，反映了我们祖国丰富而多采的生活的一角。在这里，不仅记录了她们队日的活动，而且还留有志愿军英雄崔建国的赠言，而今天，在它的新的一页上，共和国英雄柳万洙又为她们留下了勉励的语句：“努力学习、锻炼身体、为保卫祖国而奋斗！”
    人们在无拘无束地欢谈着，就象叙家常似的。看了这样的情景，使人很难断定，他们究竟是一见如故的新交，还是久别重逢的老友。
    下午四时是团中央的工间操时间。座谈会在这时暂且休息一下。贵宾们被邀来和团中央的青年朋友们联欢。随着扩音器里播送出来的集体舞的乐曲，人们踏起了轻快的步子，跳跃着，拥抱着。这时，大家才发现：代表中间的两位女同志是舞蹈家和歌唱家，于是，在热烈的掌声中，她们立刻被请出来当场分别表演了歌舞。随后大家以不同的语言尽情地唱起了同样熟悉的歌曲：“长白山绵绵山岭，……”一曲歌罢，再来一曲，在“团结就是力量”的歌声中，中朝两国青年们手拉手地踏步绕圈前进，最后共和国英雄柳万洙和朴赞洙被人们高高地抬了起来。
    ……座谈会又继续进行下去。墙上的时钟很快指到了六点，分别的时刻到了。人们怀着恋恋不舍的心情紧紧地握着朋友的手，好象要把自己全部的友情倾注到对方的身上。
