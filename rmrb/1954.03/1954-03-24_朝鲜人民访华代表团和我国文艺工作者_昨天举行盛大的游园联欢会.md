Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd:

    The Korean People's Delegation to China and Art Troupe, along with 1,700 of our country's literary and art workers, held a grand garden party yesterday in the capital's famous scenic spot – the Summer Palace.
    The beautiful Summer Palace was welcoming its guests. From early morning, people attending the garden party gathered here. Ding Xilin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and Li Zhaobing, Deputy Director, arrived, as did Zheng Lücheng, a Korean composer formerly in Beijing. Among those present were famous writers Yang Hansheng, Xiao San, Ai Qing, Zhou Libo, Liu Baiyu, Sha Ting, Tian Jian, Wei Wei, Chen Baichen, Kang Tuo, Bai Lang, Lu Zhuguo, and others; famous musicians Zhao Feng, Zhou Weizhi, Zhang Wengang, Li Wei, and others; famous artists Jiang Feng, Liu Kaiqu, Cai Ruohong, Wang Chaowen, Gu Yuan, Yan Han, Shao Yu, Hua Junwu, Ding Cong, Zhong Ling, and others; famous dramatists and actors Chen Qitong, Wu Xue, Shi Lianxing, Yu Lan, Cheng Yin, Ma Hanbing, Ma Shaobo, Wu Zuguang, Tian Fang, Zhang Yunxi, and others; famous dancers Wu Xiaobang, Chen Jinqing, Hu Guogang, Ming Na Wa, and others, as well as actors from various art troupes in the capital. Many of them had been to the Korean front lines, and today they were dressed in festive attire, ready to celebrate this most meaningful day with the envoys of the heroic people.
    At 10 a.m., the guests and hosts met at the entrance of the Summer Palace. Applause thundered, and people shook hands emotionally. In the welcoming ranks, a young actress named Wang Biyun suddenly ran out, grabbed the hand of Gao Changxing, a member of the Korean People's Army Concert Troupe, and was as affectionate as siblings. It turned out that she had participated in a comfort delegation to Korea. When she performed in Pyongyang, Gao Changxing taught her to play the accordion. Now they met again in Beijing.
    The Summer Palace became exceptionally lively. Accompanied by their hosts, the distinguished guests, wearing bright red and green flowers, toured the Summer Palace's scenic spots in two groups. The profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people permeated the air. Whether on Longevity Hill or by Kunming Lake, in the beautiful pavilions and corridors, one could see guests and hosts enjoying the sights and talking like old friends. Li Yonghao, Deputy Head of the delegation and Commander of the Korean People's Army Navy, conversed cordially with Chinese female singer Zou Dehua in fluent Chinese. He spoke of his history of guerrilla warfare in the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army and many stories of the Chinese and Korean people in the struggle against American aggressors. An Yingyi, the leader of the National Classical Art Theatre, met the actress Lan Qian, who had performed in Korea to express sympathy, during his tour. They were very familiar with each other in Kaesong, and they were even happier to meet today. While accompanying An Yingyi on the tour, Lan Qian explained the history of the Summer Palace to him. Kim Dal-hyun, the Deputy Head of the delegation, was already 71 years old. Today, he was as enthusiastic and lively as a young man. When people asked him if he was tired, he always shook his head and said, "Not tired, not tired, not tired at all!" When he met a young actor in his teens, he stroked his beard and said, "I'm as young as you." He was fluent in Chinese, and when he was in a poetic mood on the painted boat in Kunming Lake, he wrote several poems in Chinese in a row. One of them read: "I heard of Longevity Hill in the past, but only saw it today; palace music for several years, now becomes people's joy." Yoon Cheong-woo, a delegate who was on the same boat as Deputy Head Kim Dal-hyun, had studied in Beijing twenty years ago. He also wrote a poem in Chinese: "Invited to visit Yiyuan Spring, deep friendship is forever dear; returning after twenty years, the lake and mountains remain, but the master is new." During the tour, the guests and hosts also taught each other songs, exchanged souvenirs, and took photos as mementos.
    At 2:30 p.m., in front of the picturesque Hall of Dispelling Clouds and by the rippling Kunming Lake, Chinese and Korean literary and art workers held a joint performance. This square, which gathered the profound friendship of the people of the two brotherly countries, was filled with joyful laughter. The performance began: Korean meritorious actor Ding Nanxi performed the national classical instrument "Gayageum," and Chinese famous Uygur dancer Ming Na Wa performed the Xinjiang dance. In addition, Chinese and Korean literary and art workers also performed more than a dozen wonderful programs, including solo singing, chorus, dance, Peking opera, acrobatics, and puppet shows. When the "Friendship Dance" program began, in which the entire audience participated, Director Kim Eung-gi, Deputy Director Kim Dal-hyun, and others danced gracefully in the crowd. People slowly moved towards the outside of the Summer Palace. Actors from the Central Nationalities Institute's Nationalities Art Troupe and actors from the Korean Art Troupe danced the Tibetan "String Dance" together enthusiastically. The waves of people formed by the dance circles extended from the performance venue along Kunming Lake to the gate of the Summer Palace.
    In the fleeting moment before boarding the bus, people on the Summer Palace outer square kissed, hugged, exchanged photos, and left contact information. Colorful headscarves and hats waved inside and outside the carriages.

    朝鲜人民访华代表团和我国文艺工作者
    昨天举行盛大的游园联欢会
    【新华社二十三日讯】朝鲜人民访华代表团及艺术团和我国文艺工作者一千七百多人，二十三日在首都著名的风景区——颐和园举行了盛大的游园联欢大会。
    美丽的颐和园在迎接着客人。从清晨起，参加游园联欢大会的人们就向这里聚集来了。中央人民政府文化部副部长丁西林、人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部部长陈沂、副部长李兆炳来了，原在北京的朝鲜作曲家郑律成也来了。这里有著名的作家阳翰笙、萧三、艾青、周立波、刘白羽、沙汀、田间、魏巍、陈白尘、康濯、白朗、陆柱国等，有著名的音乐家赵沨、周巍峙、张文纲、李伟等，著名的美术家江丰、刘开渠、蔡若虹、王朝闻、古元、彦涵、邵宇、华君武、丁聪、钟灵等，著名的戏剧家和演员陈其通、吴雪、石联星、于蓝、成荫、马寒冰、马少波、吴祖光、田方、张云溪等，著名的舞蹈家吴晓邦、陈锦清、胡果刚、明娜娃等，还有在首都的各艺术团体的演员们。他们中很多人都曾到过朝鲜前线，今天，他们都穿上了节日的盛装，准备和英雄人民的使者欢度这个最有意义的日子。
    上午十时宾主们在颐和园门口会师了。这时掌声雷动，人们情感激动地紧紧握着手。在欢迎的行列中，一位年青的女演员王碧云突然跑了出来，拉住朝鲜人民军协奏团团员高昌星的手，像兄妹一样的亲热。原来她曾参加过赴朝慰问团，在平壤演出时，高昌星教她拉过手风琴，现在他们又在北京会见了。
    颐和园里异常的热闹起来了。贵宾们在主人的陪同下，佩戴着鲜红和翠绿的花朵，分两路尽情地游览了颐和园的名胜。这里洋溢着朝中两国人民深厚的友谊，不论在万寿山上和昆明湖畔，不管在锦绣般的亭台楼阁和长廊中间，到处都可以看到宾主们像老朋友一样地在纵情游览和交谈。代表团副团长李永镐，这位朝鲜人民军海军司令官，一路上用流利的中国话和中国的女歌唱家邹德华亲切地交谈着。他谈到了在东北抗日联军中打游击的历史，也谈到了朝中两国人民在反抗美国侵略者斗争中的许多故事。国立古典艺术剧场领队安英一在游览时遇见了曾赴朝鲜慰问演出的女演员蓝茜，他们在开城时就非常熟悉，今天相遇更是高兴。蓝茜一面陪同安英一游览，一面向他解说颐和园的历史。代表团副团长金达铉，已经是七十一岁的老人了。他今天和年青人一样热情、活泼。人们问他累不累，他总是摇手说：“不累，不累，一点也不累！”当他遇见一位十几岁的小演员时，捋着胡子表示：“我和你一样年青。”他通晓中国文字，当他在昆明湖中的画舫上诗兴正浓的时候，一连用中文写了几首诗。其中有一首写道：“昔闻万寿山，才得今日见，宫乐今几年，还成民众乐。”和金达铉副团长坐在一只船上的尹澄宇代表，二十年前在北京读过书。他也用中文写了一首诗：“承招来访颐园春，厚谊深情永可亲；二十年来重到处，湖山依旧主人新。”在游览时，宾主们还互教唱歌，赠送纪念品和摄影留念。
    下午两时半，在风景如画的排云殿前，在微波荡漾的昆明湖畔，朝中两国文艺工作者举行了联欢演出。在这汇聚了兄弟两国人民深厚情谊的广场上，充满着欢乐的笑声。表演节目开始了：朝鲜功勋演员丁南希表演了民族古典乐器“伽倻琴”，中国著名的维吾尔族舞蹈家明娜娃表演了新疆舞。此外，朝中两国文艺工作者还表演了独唱、合唱、舞蹈、京剧、杂技、木偶戏等十多个精彩的节目。当全场参加的“友谊舞”节目开始后，金应基团长、金达铉副团长等都在人丛中翩翩起舞。人们慢慢向颐和园外移动，人群中的中央民族学院民族文工团的演员们和朝鲜艺术团演员们一起热情地跳起藏族“弦子舞”来，舞圈汇成的人浪从表演场沿着昆明湖展向颐和园的大门。
    登车前霎那间，颐和园外广场上的人们相互亲吻、拥抱，交换照片、留下通讯处。彩色缤纷的头巾和帽子挥舞在车厢内外。
