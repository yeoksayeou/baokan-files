    This year, the mutual aid and cooperation movement of fishery production in Tanggu District, Tianjin City has further developed. In Donggu alone, the fishing boats organized account for more than 60% of all fishing boats.

    天津塘沽渔民提前出海捕鱼
    天津市塘沽区北塘、东沽两地的渔工和渔民，今年比去年提前二十多天出海捕鱼。现在已有满载鱼虾的渔船陆续归来。仅东沽新产鱼虾就有二十四万四千多斤。
    据有经验的渔民谈：今年天气比往年暖和，海里泥台子少（不蹧蹋网），生产条件很好，预计渔产丰富，可以源源供应人民需要。
    今年，天津市塘沽区的渔业生产互助合作运动有了进一步的发展。东沽一地组织起来的渔船已占全部渔船的百分之六十以上。渔工、渔民从一月份起就增修船网，制订生产计划，进行出海前的准备。出海后，他们便以无比的劳动热情、夜以继日地和海水搏斗，勤奋地捕鱼。　（新华社）
