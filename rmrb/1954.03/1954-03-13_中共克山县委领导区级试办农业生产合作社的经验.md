    The CPC Keshan County Committee in Heilongjiang Province successfully piloted 69 agricultural production cooperatives at the district level in 1953. This was due to the county committee's acceptance of the experiences and lessons learned from piloting agricultural production cooperatives the previous year, resulting in better performance. This was mainly reflected in "good production, small scale, high grain yield, and good influence." According to statistics from 57 agricultural production cooperatives, 46 cooperatives had incomes exceeding the best mutual aid teams in the area, accounting for 81% of the county's agricultural production cooperatives. The remaining 19% had incomes equal to the best mutual aid teams. County and district leaders also gained preliminary experience and cultivated cadres. Over the year, 107 district cadres learned the basics of running cooperatives, accounting for over 38% of the total number of district cadres. Sixty-seven village cadres were taught how to run cooperatives. In addition, 134 leading core members with independent working abilities were trained for agricultural production cooperatives.

    Over the past year, the Keshan County Committee ensured the correct progress of the pilot agricultural production cooperatives by fighting against both "leftist" and rightist tendencies. At the beginning of 1953, district and village cadres had two deviations in their understanding of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. One was the desire for more, bigger, and faster progress, wanting to quickly achieve "cooperation," with some district and village cadres even proposing the erroneous slogan of "eliminating temporary mutual aid teams and individual farmers." The other was insufficient understanding of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm for establishing them. In response, the county committee purposefully summarized the experiences and lessons of two types of typical cooperatives. One was the typical experience of the Yang Xianting agricultural production cooperative, which adhered to active leadership, grew from small to large, gradually improved, and thus had good management, high income, and high member awareness. The other was the bad example of Ding Shaosheng and others who blindly established cooperatives without considering the conditions, resulting in large scale, poor management, high debts, and low income. The county committee repeatedly promoted the principles of "active leadership, steady progress" and "only allow successful establishments, not failures" in party consolidation training classes, labor model conferences, mutual aid team leader training classes, and district and village cadre meetings, thereby overcoming the emotions of blind advancement and laissez-faire attitudes. This ensured that each establishment was a success. It also improved the understanding of the broad masses of peasants regarding the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, so many of the better permanent mutual aid teams actively requested to establish cooperatives. Those that could not establish cooperatives temporarily actively improved their mutual aid teams to prepare for establishing cooperatives.

    After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, due to lack of experience, some district committee members had a "mysterious" view of agricultural production cooperatives, believing that the work of cooperatives was complex and difficult to lead. At that time, two fears were circulating among some cadres: one was the fear of not being able to solve problems when working in agricultural production cooperatives, and the other was the fear of farmers asking about the specific operational process of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. At this time, the county committee organized the district committee to learn the knowledge and specific experience of running cooperatives, and also organized district cadres to go deep into the production process and repeatedly study the technical operation methods of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience.

    The method of organizing the district committee to learn was carried out by solving the specific problems of agricultural production cooperatives. For example, after the agricultural production cooperatives were established and transitioned to production, the phenomenon of averaging work points generally occurred. Therefore, in addition to criticizing the egalitarianism of the members, the county committee focused on studying the issue of labor organization and labor-day calculation methods, and proposed methods of organizing labor by seasonal teams or temporary teams according to seasonal production needs, the size of the cooperative, and the strength of the backbone, as well as methods of calculating labor by whole job contracting and piecework for odd jobs. This overcame the phenomenon of chaotic labor organization and improved labor efficiency.

    During summer hoeing, some district cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of transforming the small-peasant economy, again produced the deviations of wanting more, bigger, and faster progress. First of all, this was manifested in the agricultural production cooperatives' promotion of agricultural technology, with high requirements and large plans, which seriously affected the hoeing work. Secondly, some districts proposed the slogan of "agricultural production cooperatives universally implementing permanent teams," especially during the summer hoeing season, regardless of foundation or conditions, universally promoting small contracting, and not paying attention to changes in circumstances during the promotion process, not gradually improving from short to long, from simple to complex, but contracting to the end. After studying these situations, the county committee convened a meeting of agricultural production cooperative work cadres and some cooperative directors, re-studied the draft regulations of agricultural production cooperatives in the Northeast region, emphasized the working methods of proceeding from reality and the mass line of typical demonstration, and introduced the specific experience of promoting team contracting, which was very effective. In particular, due to the criticism of blindly engaging in technical processing, the societies basically implemented the spirit of "combining key processing and large-area yield increase," thereby ensuring comprehensive and timely hoeing.

    After the end of hoeing, due to the fact that the political work of some agricultural production cooperatives did not keep up, the members' thinking was confused, the labor organization was lax, and the agricultural production cooperative work cadres had the negative emotions of "fearing collapse and being punished," and were not enthusiastic about developing the work of agricultural production cooperatives, so they advocated "building fewer societies" and "building small societies." Originally, the county committee and each district committee planned to establish 100 agricultural production cooperatives in 1954, but later each district requested to reduce it to 80, and finally requested to reduce it to 60. So the county committee convened a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting to criticize the above-mentioned thoughts, and the cadres' emotions were initially changed. After repeatedly studying the general line and the CCP Central Committee's resolution on developing agricultural production cooperatives, the cadres' negative emotions were gradually overcome, the district cadres' understanding was improved, their confidence was enhanced, and their work was strengthened. The mutual aid teams that were brewing to establish societies also increased from 66 to about 300, most of which met the conditions for establishing societies. The above situation proves that strengthening the Party's policy and ideological leadership over the work of agricultural production cooperatives is one of the important methods to do a good job in agricultural production cooperatives. The various incorrect ideological understandings of cadres and peasants are specifically manifested in handling various practical problems of agricultural production cooperatives, and various ideologies have different manifestations in different periods and when dealing with different problems. Therefore, it must not be considered that "one correction will solve everything once and for all" after correcting one deviation. The leadership must maintain a clear head, be good at seeing the seeds of problems, constantly carry out socialist education, and timely criticize and correct various erroneous thoughts and erroneous tendencies.

    Another important method is to strengthen the leadership of the district committee and timely study and solve the problems of agricultural production cooperatives. The county committee's strengthening of the district committee's leadership over cooperatives has gone through a process of continuous exploration and gradual improvement. At the beginning of 1953, after the establishment of the societies, it was determined that the deputy secretary of the district committee, agricultural assistant, propaganda officer, and others would be responsible, but because there were many societies and a large area later, the leadership could not cope, and the method of "special person responsible, everyone manages" was proposed during the spring ploughing. The advantage of implementing this method is that each district committee paid attention to collective research, and generally achieved collective leadership. Some districts established a collective leadership system, adhered to it until the end of the year, and gained experience. But at the same time, some districts formed the phenomenon of "everyone manages, no one manages specifically" and "special person responsible, not digging in." Therefore, during the first hoeing, the county committee convened a county-wide agricultural production cooperative cadre meeting and proposed the method of "special person responsible, everyone learns." After implementation, the advantage was that "the special person was responsible and dug in," but some districts neglected collective leadership, forming the idea that except for cadres who specifically worked on agricultural production cooperatives, other district committee members thought it was "irrelevant to themselves," and "special person responsible" became "special person piloting." "Everyone learns" was also "learning without depth." It was not until the autumn harvest distribution work that these deviations were corrected and the spirit of the district committee collectively running the society was implemented. After a year of exploration, the Keshan County Committee realized that the more practical and feasible method of strengthening the district committee's leadership over agricultural production cooperatives is: "Collective leadership, special person responsible, task assignment by area, everyone learns." "Collective leadership" means that the district committee unifies planning, collective research, organizes forces, and checks and reports. Over the past year, most districts have established a system of studying and checking the work of cooperatives once a month. "Special person responsible" means that a special person grasps the situation, proposes plans, goes deep into key points, sets an example, and promotes the general. Over the past year, each district has had two to five cadres, such as the deputy secretary of the district committee, responsible for the work of cooperatives. "Task assignment by area" means that the district committee members implement task assignment by area contracting and fixed responsibilities for cooperatives in conjunction with various central tasks. For example, the 14th district has 15 agricultural production cooperatives, led by seven district committee members divided into four areas. Each area has one or two district committee members specifically responsible. These cadres first do a good job in the society's production in stages according to plan, set an example, and then promote the general society and mutual aid teams. This not only does not affect the leadership of the work of mutual aid teams, but also greatly influences and promotes the general mutual aid teams because agricultural production cooperatives have taken a step ahead in each stage of work. Conversely, precisely because the district committee members have fixed responsibilities, problems in the agricultural production cooperatives can generally be solved in a timely manner, and at the same time, it promotes the district committee cadres to study the work of cooperatives. "Everyone learns" is first to organize cadres to study various documents on piloting agricultural production cooperatives and study the local situation. Secondly, it is to use the "apprentice" method, that is, the district committee leads general district cadres, experienced cadres lead inexperienced cadres, and jointly learn in practice. From the end of 1953 to the beginning of 1954, 85 county and district cadres and about 105 village cadres were organized to participate in the work of establishing societies. After studying in practical work, they all understood the basic knowledge of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Because the number of agricultural production cooperatives is relatively large and the number of cadres is relatively small, the county committee and district committee have paid attention to using the working method of combining points and areas in the specific work of leading agricultural production cooperatives. Over the past year, in each season and each important work stage, attention has been paid to focusing on the situation at that time, purposefully going deep into key points, cultivating typical examples, and setting examples, thereby promoting the work of other societies and mutual aid teams. The county committee has established key districts, and each district generally has one or two key societies. All key societies that have been deeply helped by the county committee or district committee have played a role in taking the first step and promoting the general. During the spring ploughing period, the county committee and the 14th district committee set an example of the production responsibility system and short-term contracting in the He Zhicai agricultural production cooperative, and then summoned the directors and accountants of the other 14 societies in the district to visit and exchange experiences, which promoted them to also start team and contracting. Many agricultural production cooperative cadres generally reflected after the visit: "They taught us things that we didn't know how to do. Seeing it once is better than talking about it ten times."

    中共克山县委领导区级试办农业生产合作社的经验
    中共黑龙江省克山县委一九五三年领导区级试办六十九个农业生产合作社，由于县委接受了前年试办农业生产合作社的经验教训，所以这些合作社都办得较好。这主要表现在“生产好、摊子小、打粮多、影响好”。据五十七个农业生产合作社统计，有四十六个社的收入超过当地最好的互助组，占全县农业生产合作社总数的百分之八十一，其余百分之十九的社的收入和最好的互助组相等。县区领导也初步摸到了经验，培养了干部。一年来，全县初步学会办社的区干部有一百零七名，占区干部总数的百分之三十八以上；教会了六十七名村干部办社；另外还培养了有独立工作能力的农业生产合作社领导骨干一百三十四名。
    一年来克山县委是在反对“左”右两种倾向的斗争过程中，保证了试办的农业生产合作社沿着正确的道路前进。一九五三年初，区村干部对建立农业生产合作社的认识上存在着两种偏向，一种是贪多、贪大、贪快，想很快“合作化”，甚至有的区村干部提出“消灭临时互助组和单干户”的错误口号；另一种是对农业生产合作社的优越性认识不足，因此对建社劲头不大。根据这种情况，县委有目的地总结了两类典型的合作社的经验和教训。一是总结了杨显亭农业生产合作社坚持积极领导，由小到大，逐步提高，因而管理好、收入多、社员觉悟高的典型经验；一是总结了丁绍生等不根据条件盲目建社，摊子大、管理差、债务多、收入少的坏的典型例子。县委在整党训练班、劳动模范大会、互助组长训练班、区村干部会议中，通过这两个典型反复宣传了“积极领导，稳步前进”，“只许办好，不许办坏”的方针，因而克服了盲目冒进情绪与放任自流的态度。这就保证了建立一个，成功一个。同时也提高了广大农民对农业生产合作社的优越性的认识，所以很多较好的常年互助组积极要求建社；暂时不能建社的也都积极搞好互助组，准备建社条件。
    农业生产合作社建立起来以后，由于经验不足，部分区委委员对农业生产合作社有“神秘”的看法，认为合作社的工作复杂，不好领导。当时在部分干部中流传着两怕：一怕到农业生产合作社去工作不会解决问题；二怕农民问肇源丰产经验的具体操作过程。这时县委便组织区委学习办社的知识和具体经验，同时组织区干部深入生产过程，反复地学习肇源丰产经验的技术操作方法。
    组织区委学习的方法是通过解决农业生产合作社的具体问题进行的。比如，农业生产合作社成立起来转入生产以后，普遍发生平均记分的现象。因此县委除了批判社员的平均主义思想外，着重研究了劳动组织和劳动日计算方法问题，提出按季节生产需要，根据合作社的大小、骨干的强弱，实行按季节分队或临时分队的组织劳动的方法和整活包工、零活计件的计算劳动的方法。这就克服了劳动组织混乱现象，提高了劳动效率。
    夏锄中，有些区干部由于对改造小农经济的艰巨性、复杂性认识不足，因而又产生了贪多、贪大，贪快的偏向。首先表现在对农业生产合作社推广农业技术方面，要求高、计划大，严重地影响了铲趟工作。其次有的区提出：“农业生产合作社普遍实行常年分队”的口号，尤其在夏锄时期不分基础、条件，不根据生产需要，一律推行小包工，同时在推行中又不注意情况的变化，不是由短到长，由简到繁，逐步提高，而是一包到底。县委研究了这些情况后，召开了全县农业生产合作社工作干部和部分社主任会议，重新学习了东北区农业生产合作社试行章程，强调了从实际出发和典型示范的群众路线的工作方法，并介绍了推广分队包工的具体经验，收效很大。特别是由于批判了盲目搞技术加工后，各社基本上贯彻了“重点加工和大面积增产相结合”的精神，从而保证了全面及时铲趟。
    挂锄后，由于部分农业生产合作社的政治工作没跟上，社员思想混乱，劳动组织涣散，农业生产合作社工作干部产生了“怕垮台，受处分”的消极情绪，对发展农业生产合作社的工作不热情，因此主张“少建社”“建小社”。原来县委和各区委计划在一九五四年建立一百个农业生产合作社，后来各区要求减少到八十个，最后要求减少到六十个。于是县委召开了互助合作代表会议，对上述思想进行了批判，干部情绪有了初步转变。此后又经过反复地学习总路线和中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，才逐渐克服了干部的消极情绪，提高了区干部的认识，增强了信心，加强了工作，酝酿建社的互助组也由六十六个增加到三百个左右，其中绝大部分都合乎建社条件。上述情况证明：加强党对农业生产合作社工作的政策思想领导，是搞好农业生产合作社的重要方法之一。干部和农民的各种各样的不正确的思想认识，都具体地表现在处理农业生产合作社的各种实际问题当中，而且各种思想在不同时期和处理不同问题时又有不同的表现，因此，决不能认为纠正了一个偏向以后便“一劳永逸”。领导上必须要保持清醒的头脑，善于看出问题的萌芽，不断地进行社会主义教育，及时地批判和纠正各种错误思想和错误倾向。
    另一重要方法，是加强区委领导，及时研究和解决农业生产合作社的问题。县委在加强区委对合作社的领导上，是经过一个不断摸索逐步提高的过程的。一九五三年初，建社后确定由区委副书记、农业助理、宣传干事等人负专责，但因后来社多、面大，领导不过来，春耕时又提出“专人负责，大家都管”的方法。实行这个办法的好处是各区委都注意了集体研究，一般地做到了集体领导。有的区建立了集体领导制度，一直坚持到年底，并取得了经验。但同时也有的区形成“大家都管、都管的不具体”、“专人负责，没钻下去”的现象；因此在铲头遍地时，县委召开了全县农业生产合作社干部会议，又提出“专人负责，大家学习”的办法。实行后，好处是“专人负责，钻进去了”，但又有的区忽视了集体领导，形成除专做农业生产合作社工作的干部外，其他区委委员则认为“与己无关”，“专人负责”形成了“专人试办”。“大家学习”，也是“学而不深”。直到秋收分配工作中，才纠正了这些偏向，贯彻了区委集体办社的精神。经过一年的摸索，克山县委体会到加强区委对农业生产合作社的领导，比较切实可行的方法是：“集体领导，专人负责，按片分工，大家学习”。“集体领导”就是区委统一计划，集体研究，组织力量，检查汇报。一年来多数区都建立了每月研究和检查一次合作社的工作制度。“专人负责”是由专人掌握情况，提出计划，深入重点，做出样子，推动一般。一年来每区都有区委副书记等二名至五名干部负责合作社的工作。“按片分工”是结合各项中心工作，由区委委员对合作社实行按片分工包干，固定责任。如十四区有十五个农业生产合作社，由七名区委委员分四个片领导，每片都有一两名区委委员具体负责，这些干部按段有计划地首先搞好社的生产，做出样子，然后推动一般社和互助组。这样，不但不影响对互助组工作的领导，而且正由于农业生产合作社在各个阶段工作中先走了一步，对一般互助组影响和推动作用很大，反过来也正由于区委委员都有固定责任，因此农业生产合作社内发生问题时一般都能得到及时解决，同时也促使了区委干部都去钻研合作社的工作。“大家学习”首先就是组织干部学习试办农业生产合作社的各种文件和研究本区情况。其次是用“带徒弟”的方法，即区委带一般区干部，有经验的干部带无经验的干部，共同到实际中学习。从一九五三年底到一九五四年初的建社过程中，曾组织了县区干部八十五名和村干部约一百零五名参加建社工作，他们经过在实际工作中学习以后，对农业生产合作社的基本知识都明白了。
    由于农业生产合作社数量比较多，干部比较少，县委和区委在领导农业生产合作社的具体工作中，注意运用了点面结合的工作方式。一年来，在每个季节和每个重要工作阶段中，都注意了针对当时的情况，有目的地深入重点，培养典型，树立榜样，从而推动其他社和互助组的工作。县委建立了重点区，各区一般都有一至二个重点社。凡是县委或区委深入帮助的重点社，绝大多数都起到先走一步，推动一般的作用。春耕期间，县委和十四区委在贺志财农业生产合作社搞了生产责任制和短期包工的样子，然后召集全区其他十四个社的主任、会计等前来参观，交流经验，推动了他们也搞起了分队和包工。许多农业生产合作社干部参观后普遍反映：“把咱不会作的事都教会啦，看一次比讲十次都强。”
