    French Defense Minister Pleven Returns to France
    Said to Bring Back "New Plan" to Continue the War
   [Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd] French Defense Minister Pleven, who rushed to Indochina in early February, returned to Paris on March 1st.
    According to foreign news agency reports, Pleven brought back with him a "new plan" to continue the war in Indochina. One of the key points of the plan is to "specifically stipulate that the United States' economic and military assistance should be utilized as fully as possible," and "the transportation of American military assistance needs to be accelerated." Another key point of Pleven's plan is to further drive the Bao Dai puppet troops to serve as cannon fodder. Pleven said: He had "specifically considered" the issue of gradually using Indochinese puppet troops to "reduce the burden on French forces."

   【新华社三日讯】在二月上旬仓忙赶到印度支那去的法国国防部长普利文，已在三月一日回到巴黎。
    据外国通讯社消息，普利文随身带回一个继续印度支那战争的“新计划”。计划的要点之一是
  “具体规定了要尽可能充分地利用美国经济与军事援助”，“需要加速美国军事援助的运输”。普利文计划的另外一个要点就是更多地驱使保大伪军充当炮灰。普利文说：他曾“特别考虑过”要逐步用印度支那伪军来“减轻法国部队的负担”的问题。
