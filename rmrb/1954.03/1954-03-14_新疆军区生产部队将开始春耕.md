    Xinjiang Military Region Production Corps to Begin Spring Planting
    The season of melting ice and snow is approaching in Xinjiang Province. The agricultural production units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region have essentially completed their spring planting preparations and are about to begin spring plowing. This year, the area of land cultivated by machinery by the production units will account for about 30 percent of the total cultivated land of the entire army, more than double that of last year. Last winter and this spring, various units held mechanized farming training classes. According to incomplete statistics, more than 2,100 cadres and soldiers studied mechanized farming techniques and agricultural production knowledge. Hundreds of tractors, combine harvesters, and all horse-drawn farm implements used by the various farms and reclamation area units have been mostly repaired and fitted, and all parts of the machinery have been newly oiled. The plowshares of some units have even been filed with files, and the edges are bright and sharp. The "August 1st" Farm mechanized farming personnel are preparing to plow the snow, striving to plow 3,000 mu of snow-covered land before it completely thaws. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆军区生产部队将开始春耕
    新疆省冰消雪融的季节快要到来了。中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队的各项备耕工作已经基本完成，即将开始春耕。生产部队今年机耕的耕地面积将占全军耕地百分之三十左右，超过去年一倍以上。去冬今春，各部分别举办了机耕训练班。据不完全统计，有两千一百多名干部、战士学习了机耕技术和农业生产知识。各农场、各垦区部队使用的几百台拖拉机、康拜因机和全部马拉农具，已大部修配齐全，机具上各部零件都新涂上了油。有些单位的犁铧还用锉刀锉过，刃上光亮锋利。“八一”农场机耕人员正准备带雪犁地，争取在完全解冻前犁雪地三千亩。（新华社）
