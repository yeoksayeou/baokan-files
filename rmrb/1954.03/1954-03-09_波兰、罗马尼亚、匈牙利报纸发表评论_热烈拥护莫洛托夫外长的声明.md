Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: According to TASS, newspapers in Poland, Romania, and Hungary have published commentaries on Molotov's statement regarding the results of the Berlin Conference.

    The editorial in Poland's "People's Tribune" wrote: Molotov's specific proposal for the conclusion of an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe has been widely received by the people of European countries and has also been unanimously supported by the Polish people. This support is specifically reflected in the opinions expressed by representatives of workers, farmers, and intellectuals at thousands of rallies. Despite the sabotage of reactionary groups, the Berlin Conference did not fail. The conference proved that negotiations are possible and appropriate, and paved the way for a conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China. The Western foreign ministers, despite their initial opposition, finally agreed to convene the Geneva Conference.

    The editorial in Romania's "Spark" wrote: The Romanian people are very satisfied with Molotov's statement on the results of the Berlin Conference. The Berlin Conference fully demonstrated the two trends that have existed on the international stage for many years: the trend of the American ruling group and the Anglo-American group of countries reflecting the American desire to dominate the world, and the trend of the Soviet Union reflecting the policy of further easing international tensions and consolidating peace and cooperation among the people of all countries. "Spark" emphasized that the Soviet proposal on guaranteeing collective security in Europe is in line with the deep aspirations of the people of all countries and has aroused the sympathy and warm support of all peace-loving people. The Berlin Conference and the upcoming Geneva Conference, which are still the focus of public opinion, have once again proved to the world that it is possible and necessary to resolve international disputes through consultation.

    The editorial in Hungary's "Free People's Newspaper" wrote that the failure of the imperialist "policy of strength" in all aspects has made it possible for international tensions to ease to a certain extent, and made it possible for the Berlin Conference to be convened. The convening of the Berlin Conference itself proves the easing of international tensions. The Soviet government's efforts to consolidate peace and strengthen international cooperation have been successful. The newspaper pointed out that it was clear at the Berlin Conference that Western countries were trying their best to revive aggressive German militarism and use it to realize their own plans. The reason why the Berlin Conference did not reach any agreement on the German question is precisely this. This has in effect also hindered the resolution of the Austrian question.

### 波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利报纸发表评论  热烈拥护莫洛托夫外长的声明

    波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利报纸发表评论
    热烈拥护莫洛托夫外长的声明
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社讯：波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利的报纸就莫洛托夫关于柏林会议结果的声明发表评论。
    波兰“人民论坛报”的社论写道：莫洛托夫关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的具体建议获得了欧洲各国人民的广泛响应，也受到波兰人民一致的支持，在数以千计的集会上，工人、农民、知识分子代表发表的意见就具体反映了这种支持。尽管反动集团多方破坏，柏林会议没有失败。会议证明进行谈判是可能而且合宜的，并为有中华人民共和国参加的会议铺平了道路。西方外长们尽管起初表示反对，但后来终于同意了召开日内瓦会议。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”的社论写道：罗马尼亚人民十分满意莫洛托夫关于柏林会议结果的声明。柏林会议充分地表现出国际舞台上多年来存在的两种趋势：美国统治集团和美英集团国家的趋势反映着美国统治世界的愿望，苏联的趋势反映着进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固各国人民之间的和平与合作的政策。“火花报”着重指出，苏联关于保障欧洲集体安全的建议符合各国人民的深切愿望，引起全体爱好和平的人们的同情和热烈的支持。仍然是舆论界注意中心的柏林会议和即将召开的日内瓦会议，又一次向全世界证明了，可能而且必须以协商方式解决国际争端。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”的社论写道，帝国主义“实力政策”在各方面的失败使得国际紧张局势有可能在一定程度上趋于缓和，使得柏林会议有可能召开，而柏林会议的召开本身也就证明了国际紧张局势的缓和。苏联政府为巩固和平与加强国际合作所作的努力得到了成功。该报指出在柏林会议上看得很清楚，西方国家是尽力要使侵略性的德国军国主义复活，并利用它来实现它们自己的计划。柏林会议没有在德国问题上达成任何协议，其原因正在于此。这样实际上也就阻挠了奥地利问题的解决。
