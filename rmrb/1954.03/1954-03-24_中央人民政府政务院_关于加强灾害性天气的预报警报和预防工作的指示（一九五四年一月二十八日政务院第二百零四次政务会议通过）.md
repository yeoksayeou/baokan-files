Our country has a vast territory, and various regions are often subjected to large-scale disastrous weather such as typhoons, cold waves, and the accompanying rainstorms (snow) and frosts. This not only causes significant losses to national assets in industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, shipping, railways, fisheries, animal husbandry, salt industry, etc., directly or indirectly affecting our country's construction and people's lives, but also brings disease and death to the people.

Meteorological science is a young science, and currently our country's technical conditions and equipment cannot yet meet the growing demands of all parties. We still need to continue to create conditions in areas such as the construction of observation and reporting stations, the training of cadres, and meteorological scientific research to improve the quality of weather forecasts. However, for large-scale disastrous weather such as typhoons and cold waves, it is generally possible to make forecasts and warnings 24 or even 48 hours in advance. In the past, the Central Meteorological Observatory, regional meteorological observatories, and local meteorological forecasting stations have already gained certain experience in forecasting and warning about large-scale disastrous weather such as typhoons and cold waves. The Party, government, military organs, and mass organizations at the central and local levels generally attach importance to the large-scale disastrous weather forecasts and warnings issued by meteorological forecasting stations at all levels, and often conduct research, take effective measures, and timely organize various prevention efforts, thereby preventing or at least reducing losses to people's lives and property and national assets. In the future, in order to strengthen the guarantee of meteorological work for national construction and various production tasks, and to better lead and organize the people to fight against natural disasters, relevant departments at the central and local levels must further attach importance to the forecasts and warnings of large-scale disastrous weather, and seize the opportunity to do a good job in various prevention efforts.

For this reason, the following measures are hereby stipulated, and it is hoped that relevant units at the central and local levels will earnestly implement them:

	I. The existing Central Meteorological Observatory, regional meteorological observatories, and local meteorological forecasting stations must strive to be prompt and accurate in forecasting and warning of disastrous weather such as typhoons, cold waves, and the accompanying large-scale rainstorms (snow) and frosts. They should pay attention to being specific and clear about the areas and times when disasters may occur. If there are new changes in the weather situation after the forecast and warning are issued, corrections or supplements should be issued in a timely manner. In the event of individual erroneous reports, meteorological forecasting stations at all levels must immediately conduct in-depth reviews of the reasons in order to eliminate the occurrence of negligence-related accidents. At the same time, this should be used to gradually better grasp the laws of weather evolution and improve the technical level of weather analysis and forecasting.

	II. Departments of industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, shipping, railways, fisheries, animal husbandry, salt industry, etc., at all levels should consult with the Central Meteorological Bureau, regional meteorological offices, and provincial meteorological departments to determine the content and issuance standards and specific methods for large-scale disastrous weather forecasts and warnings, so that meteorological forecasting stations at all levels can follow them. The above-mentioned business departments should also be responsible for conducting detailed investigations and research on the impact and losses caused by large-scale disastrous weather, so that the stipulated content and issuance standards and specific methods of forecasts and warnings can meet the actual needs of the relevant parties. In order to grasp more meteorological data, in addition to organizing its own meteorological observation and reporting network, the Central Meteorological Bureau should also cooperate closely with relevant business departments so that stations such as hydrology, farms, and coastal ships and fishing boats can also send meteorological information on time, solving the current problem of insufficient meteorological data in some areas.

	III. People's broadcasting stations and coastal radio stations in various places should broadcast the large-scale disastrous weather forecasts and warnings of meteorological forecasting stations at all levels on a regular basis, and temporarily increase the number of broadcasts when necessary. Radio receiving stations in various places should earnestly organize listening and transmit them to neighboring areas as much as possible; ships at sea should pay close attention to maintaining close contact with coastal radio stations in various places and listen to marine weather forecasts and warnings to ensure the safety of navigation. Meteorological agencies at all levels should assist shipping, fisheries, and other relevant departments in continuing to set up storm warning stations and signal stations along the coast, large lakes, inland river ports, and fishery centers.

	IV. Relevant government departments at all levels, especially relevant business agencies, should establish a system and method for transmitting large-scale disastrous weather forecasts and warnings, and after receiving such forecasts and warnings, immediately use wired and wireless communication equipment of telecommunications bureaus and other departments and various other communication tools to widely disseminate them, and must not delay or hoard them. In areas where disasters are expected to occur, relevant government departments at all levels should, under unified leadership, promptly dispatch cadres, go deep into the masses, mobilize and organize manpower and materials, and carry out various effective preventive measures and rescue work in order to prevent or at least reduce losses to people's lives and property and national assets. Relevant leading cadres should also pay attention to correctly grasping such forecasts and warnings, so as to avoid unnecessary confusion and losses caused by blind exaggeration or negligence.

	V. Local newspapers should promptly publish forecasts and warnings of disastrous weather in their areas or localities in prominent positions. Local newspapers, people's broadcasting stations, and meteorological forecasting stations at all levels should also regularly pay attention to conducting extensive publicity on large-scale disastrous weather forecasts, warnings, prevention methods, and related meteorological knowledge in order to educate cadres, go deep into the masses, break superstitions, and strengthen the people's confidence in overcoming natural disasters.

### 中央人民政府政务院  关于加强灾害性天气的预报警报和预防工作的指示（一九五四年一月二十八日政务院第二百零四次政务会议通过）

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于加强灾害性天气的预报警报和预防工作的指示
    （一九五四年一月二十八日政务院第二百零四次政务会议通过）我国地区辽阔，各地时常遭受台风、寒潮和随之而来的暴风雨（雪）和霜冻等大范围的灾害性天气的袭击，不仅在工业、农业、林业、水利、航运、铁道、渔业、牧业、盐业等方面，造成了国家资财的重大损失，直接或间接地影响了我们国家的建设和人民的生活，而且给人民带来了疾病和死亡。
    气象科学为一年青的科学，目前我国的技术条件和设备，亦尚不能满足各方面日益增长的要求，还需在测报台站建设、干部培养训练和气象科学研究等方面，继续努力创造条件，提高天气预报质量，但是对于大范围灾害性的天气如台风、寒潮等，大体上已经可以在二十四小时甚至四十八小时以前事先作出预报、警报。过去中央气象台、各区气象台以及各地气象预报台、站对于台风、寒潮等大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报，都已经取得了一定的经验。中央和地方的党、政、军机关和群众团体，对于各级气象预报台、站大范围灾害性天气预报、警报，一般地尚能予以重视，并经常进行研究，采取有效措施，及时地组织各项预防工作，因而防止了或至少减轻了人民生命财产和国家资财的损失。今后为了加强气象工作对于国家建设和各种生产任务的保证，更好地领导和组织人民与自然灾害作斗争，中央和地方各有关部门必须更进一步地重视对大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报，并抓紧做好各项预防工作。
    为此，特规定下列办法，望中央和地方各有关单位切实执行：
      一、现有中央气象台、各区气象台以及各地气象预报台、站，对于台风、寒潮和随之而来的大范围的暴风雨（雪）和霜冻等灾害性天气的预报、警报，必须力求迅速、准确，对于灾害可能发生的地区和时间，应注意具体、明确，如预报、警报发出后，天气形势有了新的变化，并应及时发出修正或补充。遇有个别报错的情况，各级气象预报台、站务即应深入检讨原因，以消灭责任性事故的发生，同时借以逐步更好地掌握天气演变规律，提高天气分析预报技术水平。
    二、各级工业、农业、林业、水利、航运、铁道、渔业、牧业、盐业等部门，应与中央气象局、各区气象处和各省气象科商订大范围灾害性天气预报、警报的内容和发布标准及具体办法，以便各级气象预报台、站按照执行。上述业务部门对于大范围灾害性天气所造成的影响和损失，并应负责作详密的调查研究，使所规定的预报、警报的内容和发布标准及具体办法能切合有关方面的实际需要。为了掌握更多的气象资料，中央气象局除了组织本系统的气象测报网外，还应与有关业务部门密切合作，使水文、农场等方面的台、站和沿海的船舶、渔轮，也能按时拍发气象情报，解决目前某些地区气象资料不足的困难问题。
    三、对于各级气象预报台、站的大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报，各地人民广播电台和海岸电台等应定时予以广播，必要时并临时增加广播次数。各地广播收音站应认真组织收听，并尽可能向邻近地区进行传达；海上船舶更应经常注意与各地海岸电台密切联系，收听海洋天气预报、警报，以保证航行的安全。各级气象机构应协助航运、渔业等有关部门在沿海、大湖、内河港口和渔业中心，继续设置暴风警报站及信号站。
    四、各级政府有关部门特别是各有关业务机关，应建立传递大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报的制度和办法，并在接到是项预报、警报后，立即运用电信局等部门有线、无线电通信设备及其他各种通讯工具广泛传达，不得拖延积压。在预计可能发生灾害的地区，各级政府有关部门于得到是项预报、警报时，应在统一的领导下，及时派遣干部，深入群众，动员组织人力、物力，进行各种有效的预防措施和抢救工作，以防止或至少减轻人民生命财产和国家资财的损失。有关领导干部对于是项预报、警报，还应注意正确掌握，以免因盲目夸大或麻痹大意而引起不必要的混乱和损失。
    五、各地报纸对于本区或当地灾害性天气的预报、警报应及时地以显著地位予以刊登，各地报纸、人民广播电台和各级气象预报台、站，并应经常注意对大范围灾害性天气的预报、警报、预防方法及有关的气象知识，进行广泛宣传，以教育干部，并深入群众，破除迷信，加强人民对战胜天灾的信心。
        总理周恩来一九五四年三月六日
