Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th: O. Orestov wrote an article in "Pravda" discussing the French people's movement to restore peace in Indochina. He recounted the important agreement reached unanimously at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference on holding the Geneva Conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and restore peace in Indochina.

Orestov wrote: The French people are particularly concerned about the upcoming Geneva Conference, and a strong movement to end the Indochina war has been launched throughout the country. Prime Minister Laniel also acknowledged this in his speech to the National Assembly on March 5, 1954. Laniel has stated several times that he is willing to consider any proposals to achieve peace in Indochina.

Orestov discussed the reasons for the change in the attitude of the French ruling clique, saying: The colonial policies of France and the United States in Indochina have fallen into difficulties. This has been recognized by both Paris and Washington. The governments of Paris and Washington have had to carefully consider the obvious fact: attempts to crush the people's will for freedom and national independence by force have failed in both Korea and Indochina.

Orestov emphasized: One of the tasks of the Geneva Conference is to restore peace and national rights to the people of Indochina.

However, those who launched the Indochina colonial war and have continued it for more than seven years seem to dislike these principles at all. This clearly explains why the French delegation to the Berlin Conference held a contradictory, almost ambiguous attitude on the Indochina issue.

The conspiracy of French diplomacy is to drag out the negotiations on the Indochina issue indefinitely, even if it does not disrupt them. These conspiracies can only be adopted because certain groups in France fear solving the problem according to the principles of national freedom and independence, preferring empty talk of agreements to reaching agreements on the substance of the issue.

The French newspapers also pointed this out. Well-informed observers emphasized that the U.S. ruling clique firmly demanded that France not take any steps to peacefully resolve the Indochina war at present.

The "New York Times" correspondent in Saigon pointed out that the French military headquarters in Indochina is now preparing for combat deployments until the end of this year.

Orestov pointed out: All the plans of the French command and the American command behind it are only aimed at further expanding the war, and not at ending it.

If the Geneva Conference is to achieve success, an important condition is that all participants are willing to proceed from the interests of peace and recognize the legitimate right of the Asian people to fight for their freedom and independence.

However, the makers of French foreign policy actually believe that they can declare before the meeting that they are unwilling to listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Indochinese people. When Bidault spoke at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate of the Republic on March 3, he said: "There is no need to invite representatives of the Ho Chi Minh government to the meeting."

The French Prime Minister attempted to support the fabrication of "Washington official spokesmen" that the Indochina war was not launched by the French Expeditionary Force... but by the Vietnamese people led by Ho Chi Minh. However, the facts have exposed this attempt to distort historical facts.

Orestov concluded: The French army, with the support of the United States, has carried out an unjust and predatory war for more than seven years, which has caused great losses to France. In the course of this protracted war, the people of Indochina have demonstrated their unyielding determination not to allow any infringement on their freedom and independence through their heroic struggle. This obvious fact cannot be denied. To solve the Indochina issue, it is necessary to take into account the legitimate rights of these people.

    苏联“真理报”刊载论印度支那问题的文章
    揭露美法统治集团继续侵略战争的阴谋
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：奥·奥列斯托夫在“真理报”上撰文，论述法国人民争取恢复印度支那和平的运动。他追述了柏林外长会议一致达成关于举行日内瓦会议和平解决朝鲜问题及恢复印度支那和平的重要协议。
    奥列斯托夫写道：法国人民对于即将举行的日内瓦会议特别关心，争取结束印度支那战争的强有力的运动已经在全国展开。拉尼埃总理一九五四年三月五日在国民议会演说时也承认了这一点。拉尼埃曾经几次说，他愿意考虑任何实现印度支那和平的建议。
    奥列斯托夫谈到法国统治集团态度的变化的原因说：法国和美国在印度支那的殖民政策已经陷于困境。这是巴黎和华盛顿已经认识了的。巴黎和华盛顿政府不得不慎重考虑这个明显的事实：用武力来粉碎人民争取自由与民族独立的意志的企图已经在朝鲜和印度支那遭到了失败。
    奥列斯托夫强调指出：日内瓦会议的任务之一，就是要恢复印度支那人民的和平与民族权利。
    但是那些发动印度支那殖民战争并且到现在为止已经继续了七年多的人们似乎根本不喜欢这些原则。这就明显地说明了为什么参加柏林会议的法国代表团在印度支那问题上抱着自相矛盾的，几乎可以说是暧昧的态度的原因。
    法国外交的阴谋是：即使不破坏关于印度支那问题的谈判，也要把它无限期地拖下去。所以采取这些阴谋，只能是因为法国某些集团害怕根据各民族自由和民族独立的原则来解决问题，只喜欢空口谈协议，而不打算就问题的实质取得协议。
    法国报纸也指出了这一点。消息灵通的观察家着重指出，美国统治集团坚决要求法国在目前不采取任何步骤来和平解决印度支那战争。
      “纽约时报”驻西贡记者指出，法国在印度支那的军事司令部现在已经在准备到今年年底的作战部署了。
    奥列斯托夫指出：法国司令部和它幕后的美国司令部的一切打算都只是想进一步扩大战争，而并没有想结束战争。
    如果日内瓦会议要取得成就，一个重要的条件就是所有参加会议的人都愿意从和平利益出发，承认亚洲人民为他们的自由和独立而斗争的合法权利。
    然而法国外交政策的制订人竟认为可以在会前宣布他们不愿意听取印度支那人民代表的意见。皮杜尔三月三日在共和国参议院外交委员会上发言时说：“没有必要请胡志明政府的代表参加会议。”
    法国总理企图支持“华盛顿官方发言人”的胡诌说，印度支那战争不是法国远征军发动的……而是由胡志明领导的越南人民发动的。然而，事实已揭露了这个妄想歪曲历史事实的企图。
    奥列斯托夫最后说：法国军队在美国支持下，进行了七年多不义的、强盗的战争，这个战争使得法国受到了很大的损失。在这个旷日持久的战争过程中，印度支那人民以他们的英雄斗争表明了，他们不让他们的自由和独立受到任何侵害的不屈不挠的决心。这个明显的事实是无法否认的。要想解决印度支那问题，就不能不考虑这些人民的合法权利。
