    New Path for Handicraft Workers
    Pang Zhen
    More than forty years ago, Qiqihar – the old Bokui City, was a city thriving in handicrafts. It was a trade distribution center for the Nenjiang River and Inner Mongolia areas. At that time, apart from an arsenal, the city was full of handicraft workshops for wood, Ula boots, shoes, hemp ropes, etc.; without trains or cars, capitalists relied on iron carts and ox carts to trade to and from Hailar. Bai Jinshan's father, an old handicraft worker, relied on hauling goods for them to make a living.
    In the spring of 1910, during the late years of the Qing Dynasty, Bai Jinshan's father returned home braving the wind and sand and said to the just fourteen-year-old Bai Jinshan: "Son, you are growing up, you can no longer be a cart driver. Young people should learn a craft early, with a craft, you won't have to worry about food and clothing for a lifetime." From that time on, Bai Jinshan became a handicraft worker.
    Initially, he worked as an apprentice in the Tongyihe hemp rope shop. In order to make more money and deliver goods to customers in Hailar on time, the handicraft capitalists made workers and apprentices work overtime day and night. Bai Jinshan forced himself to stay awake and worked hard, while also being careful that the boss's pipe might hit him at any time. Bai Jinshan endured it, hoping to "complete his apprenticeship." In three years, he barely earned one hundred and thirty strings of cash, enough to get by.
    In those years of hardship, people began to cut off their queues, and it was said that the "Republic of China" had been established. After Bai Jinshan "completed his apprenticeship," he went to the Hecheng hemp rope shop as a hired worker. Boss Fu Da-nao (Big Head Fu) was extremely calculating, and the hired workers were so tired that they could not straighten their backs all day long.
    In the old society, the exploited were like stone rollers walking in furrows, one bump after another. An unfortunate thing happened: Bai Jinshan's thirteen-year-old fiancée died before they could get married. From then on, Bai Jinshan no longer had the strength to talk about marrying a wife.
    The terrible "September 18th" disaster came, and the Japanese invaders broke into Qiqihar. Many shoe shops and rope shops closed down, Bai Jinshan lost his job and had to pick up his father's old trade again, driving carts. Later, he cooked for others and finally went to the lower village to look after the vegetable garden.
    Qiqihar was liberated! Bai Jinshan entered the city with strange feelings. Through the introduction of old colleagues, he went to the hemp rope shop and started his old craft again. With the establishment of state-owned department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives, and the development of urban and rural trade, handicraft production recovered, and it became easier to earn money by making hemp ropes. "Let's do it on our own with a small amount of money, when will we ever get ahead as hired workers?" Several colleagues gathered one hundred and ten yuan, and led by Wang Laosan (Third Old Wang) independently started making hemp ropes. Bai Jinshan, who had been a hired worker all his life, was particularly happy to work for himself, but because of the lack of funds and poor turnover, they either had no money to buy raw materials, or they couldn't turn the goods into money, and later they had to disband.
    In January 1953, the relevant departments of Qiqihar City, according to the needs of production and the demands of unemployed workers, helped handicraft workers organize a hemp rope production cooperative. Bai Jinshan and more than thirty other hemp rope workers joined the cooperative. The production situation of the hemp rope production cooperative in the past year was something Bai Jinshan had never seen before.
    The first benefit Bai Jinshan felt after joining the production cooperative was that he could produce all year round and get rid of the pain of unemployment and semi-employment. Last year, they were almost never idle, except for the accumulation of more than 8,000 jin of hemp rope in March and April last year, and a half-month work stoppage in May. Later, with the assistance of all parties and the efforts of all members, the phenomenon of product backlog was quickly overcome. In just one month, they sold more than 13,000 jin of hemp rope, and also established a fixed trade relationship with basic construction units. Last year, this production cooperative produced 200,000 jin of hemp rope, which was not enough to sell. Bai Jinshan said: "I have been making hemp ropes for decades, and it has never been so smooth!"
    The second benefit that Bai Jinshan personally felt after joining the cooperative was that the handicraft workers became the masters of the cooperative. In the past, he only knew how to bury himself in making hemp ropes, and he dared not enter the accounting room even a step. Now the production cooperative has become a big family for handicraft workers. The production plan of the cooperative is discussed democratically; the cooperative announces the production accumulation figures once a month. Last year, they accumulated 230 million yuan of funds. Since Bai Jinshan joined the cooperative, in addition to the labor remuneration he received at the end of the year, his average monthly income was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and his life has greatly improved.
    The new country has opened up a new path for handicraft workers to organize, and this new path has brought happiness to Bai Jinshan's later years. The old handicraft worker Bai Jinshan, after walking on this new road for a year, completely got rid of the painful life of unemployment and poverty that he had suffered in the past forty-three years.

    手工业工人的新道路
    庞镇
    远在四十多年以前，齐齐哈尔——老卜奎城是一个手工业兴盛的城市，它是嫩江及内蒙古一带的贸易集散地。那时候，城里除了一个军械厂以外，剩下都是木业、靰鞡、靴鞋、麻绳等手工业作坊；没有火车、汽车，资本家等依靠铁车、牛车往来海拉尔一带进行交易。老手工业工人白金山的父亲当时就是靠为他们拉货来维持生活。
    一九一零年的春天，那是满清皇朝的末年，白金山的父亲冒着风沙回到了家，把刚十四岁的白金山找到跟前说：“孩子，你快长大成人了，不能再干赶车这个营生，年轻人趁早学个手艺吧，有了手艺一辈子不愁吃穿。”从这时候起，白金山就成了手工业工人。
    最初，他在同义合麻绳铺做学徒。手工业资本家为了多赚钱，为了赶着给海拉尔的顾客交货，让工人和学徒日夜加班。白金山强打精神，手头紧忙活，还得提防着老板的烟袋锅随时敲打过来。白金山忍受着，盼着“满徒”。三年里，好歹挣了一百三十吊钱，算混上了穿。
    在度日如年的岁月里，人们开始剪下了头上的辫子，听说成立了“民国”。白金山“满徒”以后，就到合成麻绳铺去当雇工。老板傅大脑袋算计得入骨，雇工们累得成天直不起腰来。
    在旧社会里，受剥削的人就好像石头滚子走在垄沟里一样，一步一坎。一件不幸的事情发生了：白金山没过门的十三岁的媳妇死了。从此，白金山再也没有力量说媳妇了。
    可怕的“九一八”灾难来到了，日本侵略者闯进了齐齐哈尔。许多鞋庄、绳铺都关了门，白金山失了业，只好又拣起他父亲的老营生，赶起车来。后来他给人家煮过饭，最后下屯去看菜园子。
    齐齐哈尔解放了！白金山怀着奇异的心情进了城。经过老同行介绍，他到麻绳铺又干起老手艺来。随着国营百货商店、供销合作社的建立，城乡贸易的发展，手工业生产恢复起来，耍麻绳手艺的钱也好挣多了。“打小股子自己干吧，给人家当雇工什么时候是头？”同行几个伙计凑了百十万元，由王老三领东单独打上了麻绳。白金山当了一辈子雇工，现在给自己干活分外高兴，可是因为资金太少，周转不灵，不是没钱买原料，就是有货变不出钱来，后来只好散了伙。
    一九五三年一月间，齐齐哈尔市有关部门根据生产的需要和失业工人的要求，帮助手工业工人组织了麻绳生产合作社。白金山和其他三十多个麻绳工人参加到合作社里来。麻绳生产合作社一年来的生产情况，是白金山从来没有见过的。
    白金山参加生产合作社后，感到的头一个好处是：作到常年生产，摆脱了失业半失业的痛苦，去年一年，他们几乎没有空闲过，只是去年三、四月间积压了八千多斤麻绳，五月间停了半个月工。后来在各方面的协助下，经过全体社员们的努力，产品积压的现象很快就克服了。一个月的光景，他们卖出了一万三千多斤麻绳，还和基本建设单位建立了固定的贸易关系。去年，他们这个生产合作社生产了二十万斤麻绳还不够卖。白金山说：“我打了几十年麻绳，从来没有这样顺利过！”
    白金山参加合作社后亲身感受到的第二个好处是：手工业工人当了合作社的主人。过去他只知道埋头打麻绳，柜房一步不敢进。现在的生产合作社成了手工业工人的大家庭。合作社生产计划都经过民主讨论；合作社每月公布一次生产积累的数字。去年一年，他们积累了二亿三千万元的资金。白金山参加合作社以后，除了年末得到的劳动返还金以外，平均每月收入五、六十万元，生活有了很大改善。
    新国家给手工业工人们开辟了组织起来的新道路，这个新道路给白金山的晚年带来了快乐。老手工业工人白金山在这个新道路上走了一年，就根本摆脱了以往四十三年来所受过的失业、贫困威胁的痛苦生活。
