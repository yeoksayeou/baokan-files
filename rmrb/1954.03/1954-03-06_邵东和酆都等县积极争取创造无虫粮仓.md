The Grain Bureau of Hunan Provincial People's Government has decided to promote the advanced experience of Yu杭 County, Zhejiang Province, in creating insect-free granaries in counties such as Shaodong. The grain sub-warehouses in Wulipai Township and Nanmu Township in Shaodong County have completed the first phase of work plans, including cleaning and sanitation, and killing overwintering grain insects.

When Shaodong County's key grain warehouses began to promote Yu杭 County's experience in creating insect-free granaries, some cadres had some incorrect ideas. Some believed: "It is impossible to avoid insects in rice and maggots in sauce." Some did not realize the great significance of promoting this experience and showed fear of the work, saying: "We can't even manage granaries with insects, how can we manage insect-free granaries!"

Under the guidance of the grain departments of the province and special district and the Shaodong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shaodong County Grain Bureau held a meeting of cadres from key warehouses, analyzed and criticized these ideas, and emphasized the significance of promoting this experience. After the meeting, the management cadres of the key warehouses greatly improved their work confidence and enthusiasm, believing that if Yu杭 County could do it, they could definitely do it too.

Under the leadership and encouragement of leaders at all levels, the cadres of the key warehouses in Shaodong County demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for protecting national grain and carried out the work of killing overwintering grain insects, reducing grain storage moisture, and cleaning the inside and outside of the warehouses with selfless spirit. Cao Youfa, a storekeeper at the Wulipai Township sub-warehouse, and Xu Zhaowen, a cadre at the Nanmu Township sub-warehouse, disregarded the dampness, dirtiness, and polluted air at the bottom of the warehouse when cleaning the warehouse, and crawled into the bottom of the warehouse to remove garbage; in some places at the bottom of the warehouse, there were only three inches of height, so they dug a ditch and crawled in to thoroughly clean it.

After learning about the significance of promoting the experience of creating insect-free granaries, the farmers near the granaries also enthusiastically participated in cleaning up environmental sanitation and other work. For example, there was a lot of sludge and stinky water in the yard of the Nanmu Township sub-warehouse, which was quickly cleaned with the help of the masses. As a result, the work that the warehouse had originally planned to complete in one month was basically completed in only one week.

At present, the sub-warehouses in Wulipai Township, Nanmu Township, and other places in Shaodong County have initially isolated more than 84,000 catties of unsafe grain, and cleaned more than 260 dan of garbage and sludge and more than 160 dan of broken bricks and tiles; the warehouse environment is very clean, and after cleaning, scraping, and blocking, many overwintering grain insects have been eliminated. These warehouses have decided to establish a regular cleaning and sanitation system and will vigorously carry out grain quality measurement and reporting to ensure grain safety.

In other news: The Grain Bureau of Fengdu County People's Government in Fuling Special District, Sichuan Province, has decided to create 31 insect-free granaries in the county this year.

In mid-January, at the meeting of grain depot directors from the fifteen districts of Fengdu County convened by the Fengdu County Grain Bureau, the cadres studied the documents related to the general line, clearly recognized the great significance of grain storage work for supporting industrial construction, guaranteeing supply, and consolidating national defense, and criticized some incorrect ideas of not being at ease with the work. For example, Chen Yugui, the director of the Sixth District Grain Depot, used to think that storing grain was just eating dust and not being able to wear clean clothes, which was the most "despicable" job. After studying the general line, he realized the importance of workers not being able to start production in factories without rice to eat, and he was determined to do a good job in grain storage. After everyone's research and discussion, the county guaranteed to create 31 insect-free granaries this year and used this to challenge the grain bureaus of various counties in Fuling Special District. To ensure the realization of the plan, the cadres present also carefully studied how to conduct a general survey of grain quality in the first quarter, how to mobilize the masses to protect the warehouses, vigorously kill overwintering grain insects, and establish inspection, cleaning, reporting, and other systems. At present, a patriotic grain protection movement has been launched among grain storage cadres throughout the county, and they are working hard to realize this plan. (Shen Chunlun)

    邵东和酆都等县积极争取创造无虫粮仓
    湖南省人民政府粮食厅确定在邵东等县推广浙江省余杭县创造无虫粮仓的先进经验。邵东县五里牌乡、楠木乡等粮食支库已经完成了第一阶段的清洁卫生、捕杀越冬仓虫等工作计划。
    邵东县各重点粮食仓库开始推广余杭县创造无虫粮仓的经验时，部分干部曾有一些不正确的思想。有的认为：“米里有虫，酱里有蛆，这是不可能避免的。”有的没有认识到推广这一经验的重大意义，对工作表现畏缩，他们说：“有虫粮仓都搞不赢，还搞无虫粮仓！”
    邵东县粮食管理局在省、专区粮食部门和中共邵东县委会的指导下，召开了各重点仓库的干部会议，针对这些思想进行了分析批判，着重说明了推广这一经验的意义。会后，各重点仓库的管理干部工作信心和工作热情大为提高，认为余杭县可以做到，自己也一定可以做到。
    邵东县各重点仓库的干部在各级领导部门的领导与鼓舞下，发挥了高度的爱护国家粮食的积极性，以忘我的精神进行了捕杀越冬仓虫、降低储粮水分和清扫仓库内外的工作。五里牌乡支库保管员曹友发、楠木乡支库干部许肇文等，在打扫仓库时，不顾仓底潮湿肮脏和空气污浊，爬入仓底去扫除垃圾；仓底有些地方只有三寸多高，他们就挖一条沟爬进去，进行彻底扫除。
    粮库附近的农民在了解了推广创造无虫粮仓经验的意义以后，也热烈地参加了清理环境卫生等工作。如楠木乡支库的院子里有很多污泥臭水，在群众的帮助下很快打扫得干干净净。因此，该库本来计划一个月完成的工作，只一个星期就基本完成了。
    现在，邵东县五里牌乡、楠木乡等支库已初步隔离了不安全的粮食八万四千多斤，打扫垃圾、污泥二百六十多担和碎砖瓦一百六十多担；仓库环境已很清洁，经过打扫、剔刮、堵塞等工作，越冬仓虫已消除很多。这些仓库已决定建立经常性的清洁卫生制度，并将大力进行粮食质量测报工作，以保障粮食的安全。
    又讯：四川省涪陵专区酆都县人民政府粮食局决定今年在全县创造三十一间无虫粮仓。
    一月中旬，酆都县粮食局召开的全县十五个区的粮库主任会议上，干部们学习了有关总路线的文件，明确认识了粮食保管工作对支援工业建设、保证供应及巩固国防的重大意义，并批判了不安心工作的一些错误思想。如第六区粮库主任陈宇贵，过去觉得保管粮食尽吃灰尘，穿不上干净衣服，是最“下贱”的工作。经过总路线学习后，他认识到工人没有米吃，工厂就不能开工生产的重要意义，决心作好保管粮食工作。经过大家研究讨论，全县保证在今年创造三十一间无虫粮仓，并以此向涪陵专区各县粮食局提出挑战。为保证计划的实现，到会干部还认真研究了第一季度中如何进行粮质普查，怎样发动群众护仓，大力捕杀越冬仓虫，建立检查、清洁、汇报等制度。目前，全县粮食保管干部掀起了一个爱国保粮运动，正在为实现这一计划而努力。　（沈春伦）
