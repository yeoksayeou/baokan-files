To Solve Difficulties in Repairing New-Style Farm Tools

The Industry Bureau of Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, and the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Changzhi Special District, in order to solve the difficulties faced by farmers in using new-style farm tools, such as "not knowing how to repair them when they break, not knowing how to replace parts when they are missing, and not knowing how to protect them normally," held a short-term iron and woodworking repair training class for new-style farm tools in January. One hundred and six people participated in the training class, including sixty-one ironworkers, forty-three woodworkers, and two people from other industries; among these people, thirty-eight participated in handicraft production cooperatives, thirty-six participated in agricultural production cooperatives, and thirty-two were not yet organized. After nine days of political and technical study, the trainees initially mastered the performance of various new-style farm tools, learned the knowledge of machine installation, parts replacement, repair, and protection. Moreover, twenty out of thirty-two individual households decided to participate in handicraft production cooperatives.
