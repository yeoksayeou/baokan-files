Female Train Crew Active on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway
    Liu Heng
    The female train crew on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has just celebrated its first anniversary on this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day. In this past year, their group has done an excellent job, earning the honorary title of "Winning Group" for 1953 among the eight groups, receiving a large red banner, and a bonus of one million yuan.
    The female train crew on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was established on March 8th last year. It had only been a few days since Comrade Stalin's death. At the inaugural meeting, the two female train conductors and fourteen female train attendants wiped away their tears and solemnly swore before Comrade Stalin's portrait: "We will redouble our efforts and redouble our work!"
    Throughout the year, they have kept their oath firmly in mind and worked diligently. On the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway express train, which is 505 kilometers long and operates for sixteen hours at night, they work throughout the night: checking and supplementing tickets, transporting luggage, mopping floors, scrubbing toilets and spittoons, and protecting the health and safety of passengers. They often escort seven or eight-year-old children without parental supervision like older sisters, and serve disabled veterans like younger sisters.
    Due to reasons such as studying and pregnancy, seven female train attendants were successively transferred out, but nine new female comrades were added. Among the eighteen people, the oldest is twenty-five years old, and the youngest is only seventeen. Therefore, they are often called the "Baby Train Crew," and the twenty-year-old female conductor Fang Guilan and the twenty-one-year-old female conductor Chen Xianfu are called "Little Conductors." The people of Southwest China once welcomed the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway with unparalleled excitement. Now, they are filling the suggestion books with sentences praising the female train crew with great gratitude. Among them, the "Baby Train Crew" receives the most praise.

    活跃在成渝铁路上的女列车小组
    刘衡
    在纪念今年“三八节”的时候，成渝铁路上女列车小组正好成立一年了。在这一年来，她们这个小组的工作做得很好，在八个小组中得到了一九五三年度“优胜小组”的光荣称号，得到了一面大红旗，又得了一百万元奖金。
    成渝铁路上的女列车小组是在去年三月八日成立的。那时斯大林同志逝世才几天，在成立大会上，两位女列车长和十四位女列车员揩干了眼泪，在斯大林同志的遗像面前庄严地宣誓：“我们要加倍的努力，加倍的工作！”
    一年来，她们牢记着自己的誓言，辛勤地工作着。在全长五百零五公里、夜行十六小时的成渝铁路快车上，她们总是通夜工作：要查票补票，运送行李，拖洗地板，刷净厕所、痰盂，保护旅客健康、安全等，她们常常像姐姐一样的护送没有家长陪伴的七、八岁的小朋友，像妹妹一样的伺候失掉手脚的荣誉军人。
    由于学习、怀孕等原因，有七位女列车员陆续被调出，但九位新的女同志又补充进来。十八人中，最大的有二十五岁，小的才十七。因此，她们常常被人叫为“娃娃车班”，二十岁的女车长方桂兰和二十一岁的女车长陈显富则被称为“小车长”。西南人民曾经用无比的兴奋迎接成渝铁路的通车，现在，他们又用极大的感激在意见簿上写满歌颂女列车工作人员的句子。其中“娃娃车班”受到的称赞是最多的。
