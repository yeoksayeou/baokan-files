Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 3rd: Thirty-seven of our displaced civilians who had been stranded in South Korea returned on the 2nd and revealed that the U.S. military authorities and the Syngman Rhee gang were, on the one hand, playing the trick of registering displaced civilians, and on the other hand, using threats and terror to prevent displaced civilians from returning to our area.

　　Li Jizhong, one of our displaced civilians from Busan, said: The so-called registration of displaced civilians by the U.S. military authorities and the Syngman Rhee gang "is a deceptive trick." He said that in the Choryang-dong area where he lived, more than 20 people went to register every day. However, the registration office collected their residence permits, pretended to tell them to go back and register again in a few days, and then sent the residence permits to the Lee gang police station. The police station immediately sent police and secret agents to their homes to threaten them and prohibit them from registering. Li Jizhong was also repeatedly threatened and enticed. The Lee gang secret agents promised him "to take care of his life" and warned him: "If you must go back, you will be detained and shot." However, Li Jizhong was eager to return to his hometown, so he disregarded the danger and repeatedly went to the puppet government and U.S. military agencies to demand it, and finally managed to get a registration form. However, even if our displaced civilians have gone through the registration procedures, there is still a danger of being persecuted in various ways. Li Jizhong said that a friend told him that in Busan, a person registered to request to return to his hometown, and in the middle of the night, secret agents broke into his house and beat him into a cripple. In Choryang-dong, 19 people completed the registration procedures, but only Li Jizhong himself and one other person were able to return. Li Jizhong was arrested by the Lee gang police in South Korea and was brutally beaten, and his left arm was broken.

　　Sixty-seven-year-old Li Doucan also returned from Busan. He was abducted from Wonsan to South Korea by the U.S. and Lee military and hoped day and night to return to his hometown and reunite with his family. After he completed the registration procedures, the Lee gang police knocked on his door in the middle of the night, asking him to withdraw his registration and threatening him: "If you do not withdraw, it will be unfavorable to you." The old man replied, "I will return home even if I die." More than 20 displaced civilians who had completed registration in the area where he lived, only this old man and three other people managed to return.

　　Jin Longfu, another displaced civilian who returned from Masan, said: He and two other people registered together in Masan, but after the Lee gang police "reviewed" them, these two people disappeared. An old lady with white hair from Seoul, Du Baopei, was also threatened three times by the Lee gang police after registering.

    美方用恐怖手段阻止我方失所平民返乡
    【新华社开城三日电】二日归来的三十七名流落在南朝鲜的我方失所平民，揭露了美军当局和李承晚匪帮一面玩弄登记失所平民的把戏，一面用威胁恐怖手段，阻止失所平民返回我方地区的事实。
    来自釜山的我方失所平民李基钟说：美军当局和李承晚匪帮办理所谓失所平民返乡登记，“是一个骗人的把戏”。他说，在他所居住的草粱洞，每天去要求登记的有二十多人。但是，登记所把他们的居住证收去，假装叫他们过几天再去登记，然后就把居住证送到李匪警察署去。警察署立即派出警察和特务到他们家里去威吓他们，禁止他们登记。李基钟也曾一再受到威胁利诱。李匪特务答应他“照顾他的生活”，并且警告他：“你如果一定要回去，就要把你扣起来枪毙。”但是，李基钟渴望返回家乡，就不顾危险地一再到伪政府和美军机关去要求，最后才侥幸得到了登记表。然而，我方失所平民即使办理了登记手续，还有遭到种种迫害的危险。李基钟说，一个朋友告诉他，在釜山有一个人登记要求返乡，在半夜里特务闯进门去，把他打成残废。在草粱洞，有十九个人办好了登记手续，却只有李基钟本人和另一个人能够回来。李基钟在南朝鲜曾被李匪警察逮捕，受到残酷的吊打，他的左臂被打断了。
    六十七岁的老人李斗粲也是从釜山归来的。他被美李军从元山掳到南朝鲜，日日夜夜盼望能返乡和家人团聚。在他办理了登记手续后，李匪警察就在深夜里敲开他家里的门进来，叫他撤回登记，并且恫吓他说：“如果你不撤销，会对你不利的。”老人回答说：“我就是死也要回乡。”在他居住的地区办好登记的失所平民有二十多人，就只有这个老人和另外三个人侥幸能够回来。
      另一个从马山归来的失所平民金龙福说：他和另外两个人在马山一起办理了登记，但是在李匪警察“审查”后，这两个人就失踪了。来自汉城的白发苍苍的老太太都宝佩在登记后也遭到了李匪警察的三次恫吓。
