    A Letter to Rural Sisters Across the Country in Celebration of International Women's Day
    Ren Xiuying, Vice Chairman of the "China-Soviet Friendship" Collective Farm, Changzhi, Shanxi
    March 8th is the day our working women sisters fought for and won liberation. I would like to take this opportunity to report to our rural sisters across the country on the participation of women in production at our "China-Soviet Friendship" Collective Farm. The situation here fully proves that to develop production, live a happy life, and achieve the complete liberation of women, we must follow the general line pointed out to us by Chairman Mao and take the road of agricultural collectivization.
    Most of the women sisters in our "China-Soviet Friendship" Collective Farm used to be looked down upon by men, having no status in society or even in their families. In 1952, 918 households in four villages, including Guancun in Changzhi County, organized a collective farm based on the principle of collective labor, remuneration according to labor, and distributed consumption, combining more than 14,500 mu of privately owned land by removing the boundaries, forming large tracts of collectively owned land. We women also participated in collective labor in the farm, and since then, our social and family status has become very different from what it was before. Over the past year or so, although the road we have traveled has been unfamiliar, difficult, and tortuous, through the struggle against some conservative, skeptical ideas and old habits, we have finally fundamentally changed the habit of individual production that has existed for thousands of years. We cultivate collective land as if it were our own, and we are no longer accustomed to driving an ox to cultivate our own fragmented land. Because we have implemented a production responsibility system with team members divided into teams and land divided into sections, implemented planned production, quota management, and over-fulfillment rewards, and implemented a labor day system and equal pay for equal work for men and women, our farm sisters are very enthusiastic about working. More than 120 women participate in collective labor year-round. We all feel extremely happy when we work, and everyone often says together: As long as we work hard, we will never have to worry about life again. Sometimes, when everyone is happy, they sing songs like "Our Collective Farm" and "Villagers' Happiness." Because we work collectively with men who have skills, it is easy to learn techniques, and now everyone has learned many kinds of farming techniques. For example, in one team of our Third Brigade, 16 people have learned weeding techniques, and they can also do other general farming work. Over the course of a year, we women have become a major force on the farm, with some doing 150 labor days, and the average doing around 60 labor days. Zhao Wuze is one such woman who did 150 labor days last year. She received a total of 1,760 jin of grain, and was also selected as a labor model, receiving a reward of eight chi of black market cloth, which she used to make new clothes. She was extremely happy. Take my family as an example: my husband joined the glorious People's Liberation Army, and there are only three of us at home: my mother-in-law, my child, and myself. The year before joining the farm, we could only harvest 1,200 jin of grain. After joining the farm, last year we received 3,290 jin of grain. In order to support national construction, my family sold 1,150 jin of surplus grain, which is almost equal to the total amount of grain we harvested in the year before joining the farm. I deposited 600,000 yuan from the sale of surplus grain into the bank, and also added two new quilts, and the whole family made a set of new lined clothes. Our farm sisters no longer need to ask men for food, clothing, or spending money. They can all use the rewards they earn from their own labor to improve their own lives and the lives of their families, and they can also buy rain boots, flashlights, and pens like men. Qin Ronghua even bought a bicycle. Everyone says that joining the farm is true liberation. We actively participate in collective labor, and our work ability also improves accordingly. Forty-eight women have become production team leaders, three women have been elected as farm management committee members, and twenty-six women have become labor models. The farm stipulates that during the maternity leave period before and after women give birth, labor days are still calculated according to the average labor days of ordinary women. Today, a nursery has been established on the basis of the seasonal nurseries established last year. From now on, we will no longer be afraid of having no land to cultivate or going bankrupt, the farm is our insurance vault. When we encounter special difficulties, the state and the farm will do their best to help solve them; when we encounter minor difficulties, the villagers will help each other solve them. The benefits of the farm are truly endless. The surrounding masses are also envious, and 360 households in the four villages of Guancun, Nanchui, Zhuoma, and Wangcun have sought relatives and friends to apply to join the farm. With the approval of the villager representative meeting, the farm has added 145 new households, and now we have become a large farm with more than 1,000 households. After studying the general line, the villagers are even more motivated. We have already formulated the production plan for 1954, which is to produce 5.2 million jin of grain throughout the year, increasing the yield per mu by 59 jin compared to last year. We plan to sell 1.5 million jin of surplus grain to the state in the autumn to support national industrial construction and to mechanize agriculture. Collectivization plus mechanization will be similar to the Soviet Union. We have now accumulated 700,000 dan of fertilizer, and women have also participated in the fertilizer accumulation campaign.
    Six young women on our farm are learning to drive tractors, and this year they will be sitting on machines plowing the land. Recently, the tractor station has also brought in new cultivators, harvesters, and automobiles. This year, the farm can use machines for all farming operations from spring plowing to autumn harvest, and we will definitely be able to create greater achievements in production. By next year, our lives will be even better than they are now. The management department of our farm has installed electric lights, and in a few years, all households in our village will also have electric lights installed.
    Dear sisters, in the future, let us unite closely around the Communist Party and the People's Government, follow the general line pointed out to us by Chairman Mao, and strive to realize agricultural collectivization and for our more fulfilling and happier lives!

    为庆祝“三八节”给全国农村姐妹们的信
    山西长冶“中苏友好”集体农庄副主席　任秀英
    三月八日是我们劳动妇女姐妹们用斗争谋求解放的节日。我想借这个机会向全国农村妇女姐妹们报告一下我们“中苏友好”集体农庄妇女参加生产的情况。我们这里的情况完全证明了：要发展生产，过幸福的生活，求得妇女的彻底解放，就要按照毛主席给咱们指出的总路线，走农业集体化的道路。
    我们“中苏友好”集体农庄的大部分妇女姐妹们过去被男人看不起，不仅在社会上没地位，在家庭里也没有地位。一九五二年，我们长治县关村等四个村九百一十八户人家，在集体劳动、按劳取酬、分散消费的原则下，把各家私有的一万四千五百多亩土地刨了地界，合成集体所有的大片土地，组织了集体农庄。我们妇女在农庄里也参加了集体劳动，从此社会地位和家庭地位和以前大不一样了。一年多来，虽然我们走过的路是生疏、困难和曲折的，但经过对一些保守、怀疑思想及旧习惯的斗争，我们终于翻天覆地改变了几千年来一家一户单独生产的习惯，耕种集体的土地就像耕种自己的土地一样，再不习惯一个人赶着牛去耕自己的零碎土地了。因为实行了庄员分队、土地分段的生产责任制，实施了计划生产、定额管理和超额奖励的办法，实行了劳动日制度和男女同工同酬的制度，我们农庄的姐妹们劳动可起劲啦，常年参加集体劳动的妇女有一百二十人以上。我们劳动起来都感到无比的愉快，大家经常在一块说：只要好好劳动，今后再不会为着生活发愁啦。有时大家高兴起来就唱起“我们的农庄”、“庄员乐”的歌子。因为我们是和有技术的男人在一块集体劳动，就很容易学会技术，现在大家都学会了好多种庄稼活的技术。比如我们三大队的一个队就有十六个人都学会了锄苗技术，其他一般庄稼活也都会做啦。一年下来，我们妇女们在农庄里可顶大事啦，多的做一百五十个劳动日，一般的做六十个劳动日上下。赵五则就是去年做一百五十个劳动日的一个妇女，她共分了一千七百六十斤粮食，还被选为劳动模范，得了八尺黑市布的奖，做了新衣裳，可高兴极了。拿我家说吧：男人参加了光荣的解放军，家里只有我和婆母、小孩三个人，入庄前一年才能收一千二百斤粮食，入庄后去年分了三千二百九十斤粮食。为了支援国家建设，我家光余粮就卖了一千一百五十斤，差不多等于入庄前一年收的全部粮食那样多。我把卖余粮的钱存入银行六十万元，还添了两条新被子，全家人都做了一套新夹衣。我们农庄的姐妹们再不用向男人要吃、要穿、要花了，都能用自己劳动得来的报酬改善自己和全家的生活，也和男人一样买上了雨鞋、手电、钢笔，秦荣花还买上了自行车。大家都说参加了农庄才算彻底解放啦。我们积极地参加集体劳动，工作能力也就随着提高，有四十八个妇女当了生产队长，三个妇女被选为农庄管理委员，有二十六个妇女当了劳动模范。农庄规定妇女们生小孩前后休养期间内，还要照常年一般妇女平均劳动日计算劳动日。今天又在去年建立的农忙托儿小组的基础上建立了托儿所。从今以后，我们也再不怕没地种和破产了，农庄就是我们的保险库。有了特殊困难，国家和农庄就尽力帮助解决；遇到小困难，庄员们就互相帮助解决。农庄的好处实在说不完。周围的群众也看的心热了，光关村、南垂、捉马、王村四个村就有三百六十多户农民找亲托友纷纷申请入庄。经庄员代表会批准，农庄又新添了一百四十五户，现在我们已经成了一千多户的大农庄了。经过学习总路线，庄员们的干劲更大了，我们已经订出了一九五四年的生产计划，全年要生产五百二十万斤粮食，每亩要比去年增产五十九斤粮食，秋后计划要卖给国家一百五十万斤余粮。支援国家工业建设，也为了使农业机械化。集体化再加上机械化，那就和苏联差不多了。现在我们已经积好了七十万担肥料，妇女也参加了积肥运动。
    我们农庄有六个青年妇女在学习开拖拉机，今年她们就要坐在机器上犁地了。最近拖拉机站又新来了中耕机、收割机和汽车等，农庄今年从春耕到秋收都可以完全用机器耕作，在生产上一定能够创造出更大的成绩来，到明年我们的生活又会比现在变的更好，我们农庄管理部已经安了电灯，再过几年以后我们全庄各户也都会安上电灯。
    各位亲爱的姐妹们，今后咱们要紧紧地团结在共产党和人民政府的周围，按照毛主席给咱们指出的总路线，为实现农业集体化、为我们更加美满更加幸福的生活而努力吧！
