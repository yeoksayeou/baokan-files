    Chuvash Stalin Collective Farm
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    Recently, before the arrival of the spring ploughing season, the Soviet Union successively held the All-Union Conference of Workers of Machine Tractor Stations, the All-Union Conference of Workers of State Farms, and the All-Russian Conference of Advanced Agricultural Workers. These important meetings indicate that the Soviet Communist Party, the government, and the people are making tremendous efforts to implement the task of further developing agriculture. These important meetings indicate that, with a large number of technical equipment and cadres replenished in the half year since the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee last year, Soviet agricultural laborers are exerting tremendous initiative and potential. Responding to the call of the Party, laborers from all over the Soviet Union have applied to go to Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Volga River basin to cultivate virgin and wasteland. Responding to the call of the Party, agricultural laborers across the Soviet Union have launched a socialist competition to increase production.
    At the end of the All-Russian Conference of Advanced Agricultural Workers, I visited S.K. Korotkov, who participated in the conference.
    Comrade Korotkov is the chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Vurnarsky District of the Chuvash Autonomous Republic (between Gorky and Kazan). This Socialist Labor Hero with graying hair and a gold star is a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He has been the chairman of the collective farm for twenty-three years, and he has personally walked the path of agricultural collectivization. He first recalled the scene of those years.
    Before the October Revolution, the village of Koltsovka, where Korotkov was located, had 160 households, all living in hunger. Among the 160 households, 60 had no livestock at all, 40 had only thin horses but no cattle, and only 15 had just enough grain to survive. There were no literate people in the whole village. The residents of Chuvash were on the verge of extinction. After the October Revolution, the farmers in the village got land, and the situation improved. However, due to low productivity, the farmers had not yet escaped poverty. In 1927, 20 poor farmers formed a land commune, which convinced the farmers of the benefits of collectivization. In 1928, the commune developed into an agricultural labor association (collective farm), initially with 28 poor farmers participating. At that time, the rich peasants wanted to shake their confidence in collectivization, ridiculing them and saying that they were doomed to failure. But the state helped them; they got farm tools, bought draught animals, and began to cultivate and sow the land together. Then the rich peasants stepped up their intimidation, and five farmers wavered and withdrew. However, the collective farm's harvest that year was higher than that of the rich peasants. After the harvest, the farmers who had withdrawn returned, and many new farmers joined.
    Comrade Korotkov said: When starting to organize a collective farm, on the one hand, there must be people who are truly loyal to the cause of socialism as the backbone, because people play a decisive role; on the other hand, it is necessary to persuade the middle peasants well, especially those who have prestige and influence among the farmers, because when they understand the benefits of collectivization and join the collective farm, many people will follow suit.
    Comrade Korotkov made a comparison between today's Stalin Collective Farm and the village of Koltsovka before the revolution. In this comparison, the superiority of the Soviet collective farm is vividly demonstrated.
    In 1913, each farmer produced an average of only 86.6 poods of grain (equal to 2,837 catties), which was difficult to live on after paying rent and taxes. In the last seven years, each collective farmer has produced an average of 461 poods of grain (equal to 15,102 catties) per year, an increase of 4.3 times. After completing the state's procurement plan, paying the in-kind remuneration for the work of the tractor station, and leaving the seed fund, feed fund, and insurance fund, the average income of each collective farmer in the last seven years has been 171 poods (equal to 5,602 catties) of grain alone. The lives of collective farmers are getting happier day by day. In 1953, the remuneration for each work-day, all converted into cash, was 21 rubles. Collective member Gulshutkin received 319 poods (equal to 10,450 catties) of wheat and rye in work-day remuneration, Burlakov received 262 poods, Naumova received 260 poods, and Steyeva received 253 poods. All 435 collective farming households have their own side occupations, with each household's private garden having a dairy cow, two pigs, five or six sheep, dozens of geese, as well as turkeys and bees. In the past two years, the villagers have built fifty new houses. In recent years, all the houses have been renovated.
    Before the October Revolution, there were no cultural and educational institutions in the village; now the farm has established a middle school, where 490 farmers' children are studying. Previously, the farmers were illiterate; now collective farmers subscribe to central, local, and farm newspapers. For fifteen years, the farm itself has published a letterpress tabloid "Stalin Worker," twice a week, with 500 copies each time. All the villagers' houses are equipped with electric lights and radios. The farm's club can accommodate 500 spectators, and inside there is a library and reading room. Previously, when farmers were sick, they had to go forty or fifty kilometers to ask for a doctor; now the farm has a hospital, including internal medicine, obstetrics, and pediatrics, as well as a clinic equipped with X-ray and physical therapy equipment. The farm has its own park.
    The Stalin Collective Farm, led by Comrade Korotkov, pays attention to correctly combining the collective interests of the collective farm with the personal interests of the villagers, and pays attention to adopting advanced agricultural technology and experience, so the production of the collective farm is constantly consolidated and developed, which is the source of the happy life of the villagers.
    The Stalin Collective Farm continuously strives to increase the yield per unit area of ​​crops. The average yield of spring wheat per hectare was 1,400 kg in 1944-46, 2,790 kg in 1947-49, 3,200 kg in 1950-53, and will be 5,000 kg in 1955. The yields of potatoes, vegetables, feed crops, and industrial crops are also constantly increasing.
    Deep plowing and applying a large amount of fertilizer at the same time is the secret of the Stalin Collective Farm's ability to produce abundant agricultural products on previously barren land. Relying on tractors, the land for planting wheat is plowed to a depth of 30 centimeters. It applies 20,000 tons of manure and nearly 1,000 tons of mineral fertilizers to the cultivated land every year. It uses high-yielding seeds suitable for the local area, uses advanced sowing methods, and chooses the most appropriate agricultural season for cultivation.
    Due to good weeding, the Stalin Collective Farm last year planted potatoes and other crops on land that should have been completely fallow, in order to restore fertility and make full use of the land. Its experience proves that planting potatoes first on land for spring wheat is not only beneficial to spring wheat but can also harvest more potatoes. The Stalin Collective Farm's experience of replacing completely fallow land with potato fallow land is of great significance to collective farms with less cultivated land in non-black soil areas. In 1952, it planted only 60 hectares of potatoes. In 1953, due to occupying completely fallow land, it planted 250 hectares, harvesting 50,000 quintals, of which 20,000 quintals were used as feed. By 1955, the land for planting potatoes will be expanded to 400 hectares, and the harvest will reach 100,000 quintals.
    Unlike other collective farms, the Stalin Collective Farm does not have any pasture grassland. But it relies on rational use of land, increasing the planting of potatoes and pasture, and improving livestock breeds to develop public livestock farming as well. Now it has 540 cattle, including 150 dairy cows, 1,000 pigs, including 350 sows; an average of one horse, five cattle, seven pigs, sixteen sheep, and fifty poultry per ten hectares of cultivated land.
    All members of the Stalin Collective Farm strive to produce 13 quintals of grain, 34 quintals of potatoes, and 13.5 quintals of dry pasture from each hectare of cultivated land this year, and strive to produce 50 quintals of pork and 260 quintals of milk from every 100 hectares of cultivated land.
    Comrade Korotkov said: In 1955, the cash income of the Stalin Collective Farm will reach 5 million rubles, and the total cash remuneration for each work-day of the villagers will increase to 42 rubles. The formerly barren place has become an increasingly prosperous place. How superior is the collective farm system!

    楚瓦什斯大林集体农庄
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    最近，在春耕到来之前，苏联连续举行了全苏机器拖拉机站工作人员会议、全苏国营农场工作人员会议、全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议。这些重要会议说明，苏联共产党、政府和人民正以巨大的努力来贯彻进一步发展农业的任务。这些重要会议说明，在苏共中央去年九月全会以后半年中补充了大批技术设备和干部的条件下，苏联农业劳动者在发挥着巨大的积极性和潜在力。响应党的号召，苏联各地劳动者纷纷申请到西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域去开垦处女地和荒地。响应党的号召，苏联各地农业劳动者展开了增产的社会主义竞赛。
    在全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议结束的时候，我访问了参加会议的斯·克·科罗特科夫。
    科罗特科夫同志是楚瓦什自治共和国（在高尔基与喀山之间）甫尔纳尔区斯大林集体农庄主席。这位鬓发灰色、佩带金星的社会主义劳动英雄，是苏联最高苏维埃代表。他已经当了二十三年集体农庄主席，他亲身走过农业集体化的道路。他首先回忆了当年的情景。
    十月革命以前，科罗特科夫所在的科尔佐甫卡村，有一百六十户人家，都过着饥饿的生活。一百六十户中，六十户没有任何牲畜，四十户只有瘦马没有牛，只有十五户的粮食仅仅够糊口。全村没有识字的人。楚瓦什的居民处在灭绝的边缘。十月革命以后，村里农民得到了土地，情况有了改善。但是因为生产力低，农民还没有脱离贫困状态。一九二七年有二十户贫农组成了土地共耕社，共耕社使农民信服了集体化的好处。一九二八年共耕社就发展为农业劳动组合（集体农庄），开始时有二十八户贫农参加。当时富农想动摇他们对集体化的信心，讥笑他们，说他们注定要失败。但是国家帮助他们；他们得到农具，买了耕畜，开始协力地耕地、播种。于是富农加紧恫吓他们，有五户农民动摇退出了。然而，集体农庄当年收获量比富农还高。收获后，退出的农户又回来了，并有许多新的农户加入。
    科罗特科夫同志说：在开始组织集体农庄时，一方面要有真正忠实于社会主义事业的人作骨干，因为人起着决定作用；另一方面要很好说服中农，特别是说服那些在农民中有威望有影响的人，因为当他们了解到集体化的好处而加入集体农庄时，许多人也会跟着加入。
    科罗特科夫同志以今天的斯大林集体农庄与革命前的科尔佐甫卡村作一个比较。在这个对比中，苏联集体农庄的优越性鲜明地表现了出来。
    在一九一三年，每户农民平均只生产八十六点六普特谷物（等于二千八百三十七市斤），在缴租纳税后就难于过活。在最近七年中，每户集体农民每年平均生产四百六十一普特谷物（等于一万五千一百零二市斤），即增加了四点三倍。在完成国家的采购计划，付出对拖拉机站工作的实物报酬，留下种籽基金、饲料基金和保险基金之后，七年来平均每户集体农民每年收入仅仅粮食一项就有一百七十一普特（等于五千六百零二市斤）。集体农民生活过得一天比一天幸福。一九五三年每个劳动日的报酬都折成现金是二十一卢布。庄员枸尔舒特金得到了劳动日报酬三百一十九普特（等于一万零四百五十市斤）小麦和黑麦，布尔拉科夫得到了二百六十二普特，纳乌莫娃得到了二百六十普特，斯捷耶娃得到了二百五十三普特。四百三十五户集体农民都有自己的副业，每户的宅旁园圃中有一头奶牛、两头猪、五、六只羊、几十只鹅以及火鸡、蜜蜂。最近两年中，庄员建立了五十幢新屋。最近几年来所有住屋都改修过。
    十月革命以前，村里没有什么文化教育机关；现在农庄已建立一所中学校，那里有四百九十个农民子女在学习。以前农民是文盲；现在集体农民订阅着中央、地方和本农庄的报纸。十五年来农庄自己出版铅印小报“斯大林工作者”，每周两期，每期五百份。所有庄员的住宅都装上了电灯和广播器。农庄的俱乐部可以容纳五百观众，里面有图书馆和阅览室。以前农民有病要到四、五十公里外请医生；现在农庄有包括内科、产科、儿科的医院，以及配备着爱克斯光与理疗器械的医务所。农庄有自己的公园。
    科罗特科夫同志领导的斯大林集体农庄，注意把集体农庄的公共利益与庄员的个人利益正确地结合起来，注意采用先进农业技术和经验，所以集体农庄的生产不断的巩固与发展，这是庄员幸福生活的由来。
    斯大林集体农庄不断努力提高农作物的单位面积产量。春小麦每公顷平均收获量在一九四四——四六年为一千四百公斤，在一九四七——四九年为二千七百九十公斤，在一九五○——五三年为三千二百公斤，到一九五五年将为五千公斤。马铃薯、蔬菜、饲料作物、技术作物的收获量都同样不断提高着。
    深耕同时追施大量肥料，这是斯大林集体农庄能够在已往贫瘠的土地上生产丰富的农产品的秘诀。依靠拖拉机，种小麦的土地耕到三十公分深。它每年在耕地上追施二万吨粪和近千吨矿质肥料。它采用丰产的、适合当地的种籽，使用先进的播种方法，选择最适当的农时耕作。
    由于很好地除草，斯大林集体农庄去年在本来应该完全休闲的土地上种了马铃薯及其他作物，以恢复地力和充分使用土地。它的经验证明，在种春小麦的土地先种马铃薯，既有利于春小麦，又能多收获马铃薯。斯大林集体农庄以种马铃薯的休闲地代替完全休闲地的经验，对于非黑土地带耕地较少的集体农庄是有巨大意义的。在一九五二年它只种了马铃薯六十公顷，一九五三年由于占用完全休闲地种了二百五十公顷，收了五万公担，其中二万公担作为饲料。到一九五五年种马铃薯的土地将扩增到四百公顷，收获量将达十万公担。
    与其他集体农庄不同，斯大林集体农庄没有一点牧场草地。但它靠合理使用土地，增种马铃薯和牧草，改良畜种，同样发展着公有饲畜业。现在它有五百四十头牛，其中一百五十头奶牛，一千头猪，其中三百五十头母猪；平均每十公顷耕地有一匹马、五头牛、七头猪、十六只羊和五十只家禽。
    斯大林集体农庄全体庄员争取今年从每公顷耕地上生产十三公担谷物、三十四公担马铃薯、十三公担半干牧草，争取从每一百公顷耕地上生产五十公担猪肉、二百六十公担牛奶。
    科罗特科夫同志说：一九五五年斯大林集体农庄的现金收入将达到五百万卢布，庄员每个劳动日报酬全部折成现金将增加到四十二卢布。过去贫瘠的地方变成日益富庶的地方。集体农庄制度是多么优越啊。
