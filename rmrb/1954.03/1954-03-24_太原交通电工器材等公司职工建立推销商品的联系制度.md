Employees of the state-owned Taiyuan Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch, Hardware Machinery Branch, and Chemical Raw Materials Branch created the "Connection Promotion Method" (also known as the "Combined Promotion Method") during the increased production and conservation campaign last year, which played a significant role in carrying out promotion work.

The specific content of the connection promotion method is that if any of the three companies discovers business leads of the others, they immediately communicate the information and follow up on the supply; at the same time, the personnel from the three companies who visit factories stagger their factory and mine visits, taking turns to make contact, to avoid the phenomenon of the three companies contacting the same factory simultaneously, which would negate their strength.

The predecessors of the three companies were the Provincial Industrial Equipment Company. After they were separated in April last year, they encountered many new problems in their work. For example, the main commodities managed by the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch are electrical goods, while the Hardware Machinery Branch manages hardware machinery or tools. However, customers often couldn't distinguish which company managed what, either buying from this one or that one, which made it inconvenient for customers to purchase goods. When the three companies encountered the above situation, they sometimes introduced the other party casually, but no one cared about whether the transaction was completed or what other problems there were. As a result, some factories and mines preferred to purchase complete sets of goods from Shanghai rather than purchasing them separately from the three companies locally. On the other hand, after the three companies operated separately, each company only had three or four factory visiting salespersons. Separating three or four people to run to dozens of scattered factories, mines, and construction sites not only couldn't provide adequate coverage, but also doing a separate business each to the same factory mutually negated their strength. Therefore, some factory visiting personnel of the three companies began to experience that "this situation is not good" and should be improved.

After the increased production and conservation campaign was launched last September, the work of the employees was further improved. The factory visiting personnel felt the importance of the connection in business operations between state-owned companies. In late November last year, the business departments of the Hardware Machinery Branch and the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch jointly held a "Factory Visiting Personnel Liaison Meeting" to specifically study the method of combined promotion by the three companies, creating the "Connection Promotion Method."

In the connection promotion, the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch and the Hardware Machinery Branch both benefited greatly. For example, in October last year, when Cui Xiaoyue of the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch went to a certain engineering company, no one from the Hardware Machinery Branch had visited before. The engineering company wanted to buy sixty tons of steel but didn't know who to buy from. Cui Xiaoyue immediately informed Meng Zhaojin of the Hardware Machinery Branch, and the transaction was completed in full. When the Provincial Animal Husbandry Farm made a well-drilling plan, it wanted to purchase an air compressor and an electric motor. After Meng Zhaojin learned about it, he immediately sold the air compressor from his company and introduced the electric motor to the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch, which completed the transaction. At the same time, the use of labor by the two companies also initially achieved rationality. According to preliminary statistics from the two companies, the commodities promoted through mutual introductions amounted to more than 900 million yuan. The electrical goods managed by the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch in the fourth quarter of last year were able to over fulfill the task month by month, and the connection promotion played a significant role. The factories and mines using the goods were also satisfied with the connection promotion.

In addition, the Chemical Raw Materials Branch also has close relations with the Hardware Machinery Branch and the Transportation Electrical Equipment Branch, so it also established a connection system. (Zhou Guoyu)

    太原交通电工器材等公司职工建立推销商品的联系制度
    国营太原交通电工器材分公司、五金机械分公司和化工原料分公司业务员，在去年增产节约运动中，创造了“接线推销法”（也叫“结合推销法”），对开展推销工作起了很大作用。
    接线推销法的具体内容，即三个公司的任何一方，如发现彼方的业务线索，立即互通消息，跟踪供应；同时三公司的跑厂人员，适当错开跑厂跑矿日期，轮番联系，避免三公司同时联系一厂，抵消力量的现象。
    三公司的前身是省工业器材公司，去年四月分开后，工作上都遇到了不少新的问题。如交通电工器材分公司所经营的主要商品是电工商品，五金机械分公司经营的则是五金机械或工具，但这些东西，顾主常分不清是谁家经营，不是向这家买，就是向那家买，顾主感到买货不方便。三个公司遇到上述情况，有时就顺便给对方介绍一下，但是否成交了或还有什么问题，就再没有人关心和过问了。以致有的厂矿为了整套购货，情愿去上海采购，而不愿就地从三家公司分开采购。再一方面，三个公司分开经营后，每个公司只有三、四个跑厂业务员，三、四个人分开跑数十个分散的厂矿和工地，不但人力照顾不过来，而且同至一厂各分做一份买卖，也相互抵消力量，被联系的厂矿也感觉到卖主太多了。所以三个公司的部分跑厂员开始体验到“这种情况不太好”应该改进。
    去年九月展开增产节约运动后，职工们的工作进一步提高。跑厂人员感到国营公司和国营公司间业务经营上联系的重要性。去年十一月下旬，五金机械分公司、交通电工器材分公司的营业部，联合召开了“跑厂人员联系会议”，具体研究了三个公司结合推销的办法，创造了“接线推销法”。
    在接线推销中，交通电工器材分公司、五金机械分公司都得到了很大的好处。如去年十月份，交通电工器材分公司崔效岳到某工程公司时，五金机械分公司还没有人去过，工程公司要买六十吨钢材不知道向谁家买，崔效岳便立即转告给五金机械分公司孟昭金，如数成交了。省种畜场作打井计划，要购买空气压缩机和电动机，孟昭金了解后，立即从本公司卖给了空气压缩机，把电动机介绍给交通电工器材分公司成交了。同时，两公司劳力使用也初步达到合理。据两个公司的初步统计，因相互介绍而推销的商品即达九亿元以上。去年第四季度交通电工器材分公司经营的电工商品，能月月超额完成任务，接线推销起了不小作用。用货厂矿对接线推销也满意。
    另外，化工原料分公司与五金机械分公司、交通电工器材分公司也有较密切的关系，因此也建立了联系制度。　（周国瑜）
