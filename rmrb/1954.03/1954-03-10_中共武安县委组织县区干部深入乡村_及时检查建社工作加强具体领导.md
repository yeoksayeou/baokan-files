The CPC Wu'an County Committee Organizes County and District Cadres to Go Deep into Villages to Check on the Work of Establishing Cooperatives and Strengthen Specific Leadership

In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the CPC Wu'an County Committee in Hebei Province promptly checked the work of establishing cooperatives. After discovering problems such as the leadership work lagging behind actual progress and some cadres blindly establishing cooperatives, it immediately strengthened its leadership over the work of establishing cooperatives and corrected the deviations.

More than 10,000 peasant households in Wu'an County requested to join and establish new agricultural production cooperatives. Among them, more than 8,000 peasant households requested to establish 561 new cooperatives. After preliminary review by the county and district, 338 cooperatives basically met the conditions for establishment. The peasants who were establishing cooperatives actively requested the county and district cadres to lead them and provide them with specific assistance. At this time, in the leadership work of establishing cooperatives, two situations appeared in some places: one situation was that many county and district cadres did not understand the work of establishing cooperatives and did not dare to lead. For example, the cadres and activists of Lifu Village in the Eleventh District requested Li Guochang, a member of the CPC District Committee working in the village, to help them establish a cooperative, but Li Guochang did not dare to intervene. Some masses, unable to get help from the county and district cadres, established cooperatives spontaneously, regardless of the conditions. In Sanbaishu Village, First District, eight new agricultural production cooperatives were established, three of which were spontaneously established without leading backbone. Some also dampened the enthusiasm of the peasants to establish cooperatives because the leadership work could not keep up. Qin Tianbao, secretary of the CPC Nan Changshun Village Branch, organized a cooperative, but because of the lack of specific methods for establishing a cooperative and no one from the district to lead it, the cooperative disbanded. Another situation that arose in the leadership work of establishing cooperatives was that some county and district cadres did not grasp the policy of "actively leading and steadily advancing." Driven by the enthusiasm of the masses, they established cooperatives regardless of the conditions. For example, Cuilu Village in the Eighth District had no mutual aid foundation at all, and the Party's leadership strength in the village was also very weak, but Li Guorui, a district worker working in the village, established twelve cooperatives in the village, regardless of these circumstances. The CPC branch leadership in Yuanshui Village was also very weak. Last year, the village established an agricultural production cooperative, which disbanded because of ideological differences between cadres and the masses. This year, the district launched a cooperative village here all at once. The mutual aid foundation and leadership strength of Miaozhuang in Xijiao Township, Ninth District, were both weak, but the district cadres working in the township, seeing that Xijiao, Nanzhuang, and other villages in the township had all been collectivized, forced the establishment of cooperatives in Miaozhuang in order to form a collectivized township, turning it into a collectivized village as well.

After studying the above situation, the CPC Wu'an County Committee instructed all districts to strictly implement the central government's instructed policy of "actively leading and steadily advancing" in establishing cooperatives, and required the secretaries of all district committees to strengthen specific leadership over the work of establishing cooperatives, so that the mutual aid and cooperation movement could gradually develop in depth and normally. The instructions also required all cadres to learn and do at the same time, so that they could immerse themselves in the work and become experts.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the work of establishing cooperatives, the county committee also adopted the following specific measures: First, members of the county committee were dispatched to various districts to conduct specific inspections in villages and townships, and to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, after Liu Yuming, the second secretary of the county committee, arrived in the Eighth District, he listened to the report of the district committee and went deep into Cuilu Village to conduct inspections and correct the deviation of rushing ahead in the village. Under the guidance of Liu Yuming, the district committee immediately sent main cadres to Paihuai and other villages to strengthen specific leadership and correct the deviation of being impetuous and rash in the work of establishing cooperatives. Second, each district formed a work team composed of main cadres to lead key projects in depth, create and summarize experiences in establishing cooperatives in a timely manner, and then promote them. Zhao Dewei, deputy secretary of the CPC Seventh District Committee, led key projects in establishing cooperatives in Nanyangyi Village. After the cooperative was established, he convened a conference of district and township cadres and invited Chen Fengtai, the director of the Nanyangyi Agricultural Production Cooperative, to report to everyone on their experience in conducting ideological mobilization, studying the articles of association, evaluating land and labor, electing cadres, and how to transition to agricultural production in the establishment of cooperatives. After listening to the reports, the cadres all found ways to establish cooperatives. Third, use the method of insiders teaching outsiders to help cadres who are not familiar with the business of establishing cooperatives and new cooperative cadres to learn the methods of establishing cooperatives. When the full-time cadres of the county and district who lead mutual aid and cooperation lead general cadres in key projects of establishing cooperatives, they patiently teach them how to work and help them improve their ability to run cooperatives. When the working group of Boyan Township, Second District, led the establishment of cooperatives in Boyan Village, they held joint meetings of cadres from new and old cooperatives in the village many times, and absorbed district cadres who were not familiar with the business of establishing cooperatives to participate, study the methods of running cooperatives together, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for each other's weaknesses to enrich the experience of running cooperatives. Everyone felt that after doing this, the difficult problems were greatly reduced. The dozens of cooperatives that were newly established and expanded in the village all formulated articles of association, completed the evaluation of land and labor, and elected cadres in less than half a month. Fourth, in order to fully lead the work of establishing cooperatives and preparing for spring ploughing and production, the county has recently transferred more than 170 county and district cadres for training. During the training, everyone was asked to study the "Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives." The county committee repeatedly explained the policies, policies, and working methods for establishing cooperatives, and systematically introduced the experience of establishing cooperatives in Bei Wenzhang. All the trained cadres, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, reviewed the past work of establishing cooperatives and were determined to lead the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production well, so that they could change from outsiders to insiders.

    中共武安县委组织县区干部深入乡村
    及时检查建社工作加强具体领导
    中共河北省武安县委在互助合作运动中，及时检查建社工作，发现领导工作落后于实际进展和部分干部盲目建社等的问题以后，便立即加强了对建社工作的领导，纠正了偏向。
    武安县有一万多户农民要求参加和新建立农业生产合作社。其中有八千多户农民，要求建立五百六十一个新社，经县、区初步审查，已有三百三十八个社基本上具备了建社条件。建社的农民积极要求县、区干部领导他们，给他们以具体帮助。这时，在建社的领导工作中，有些地方却出现了两种情况：一种情况是不少县、区干部不懂建社工作，不敢领导。如十一区礼服村的干部和积极分子，要求在该村工作的中共区委委员李国昌帮助他们建社，李国昌却不敢过问。有些群众得不到县、区干部的帮助，就不顾条件，自发地建起社来。一区三柏树村新建立了八个农业生产合作社，其中就有三个社是没有领导骨干，自发地建立起来的。有的因为领导工作赶不上，还打击了农民要求建社的热情。中共南常顺村支部书记秦天保组织了一个社，可是因为缺乏建社的具体办法，区里又没有人去领导，这个社便又散了。在建社的领导工作中出现的另一种情况是，某些县、区干部没有掌握了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，在群众热情的促使下，就不顾条件地建起社来。如八区崔炉村根本没有互助基础，村里党的领导力量也很薄弱，在该村工作的区工作员李国瑞却不顾这些情况，领导着这村建立了十二个社。苑水村的中共支部领导力量也很弱，去年这村建立了一个农业生产合作社，还因为干部和群众的思想不通散了班，今年区里却一下子在这里轰起了一个合作化村。九区西峧乡苗庄的互助基础、领导力量都弱，但在这乡工作的区干部，见这乡西峧、南庄等村已全村合作化，为了凑成一个合作化乡，就在苗庄也勉强建立合作社，使它也变成合作化村。
    中共武安县委研究了上述情况以后，便指示各区严格执行中央所指示的“积极领导，稳步前进”的建社方针，要求各区区委书记对建社工作加强具体领导，使互助合作运动，逐步深入而正常地发展。指示中并要求全体干部边学、边做，使自己钻进去，成为内行。
    为了加强建社工作的领导，县委还采取了以下几种具体措施：第一，由各县委委员分赴各区，深入乡、村进行具体检查，发现问题，及时解决。如县委第二书记刘玉明到八区后，听取了区委汇报，就深入崔炉村检查，纠正了该村的冒进偏向。该区区委在刘玉明的指导下，并即派出主要干部到徘徊等村加强具体领导，纠正建社工作中急躁冒进的偏向。第二，各区由主要干部组成工作组，深入重点领导，及时创造和总结建社经验，再加推广。七区中共区委副书记赵德维在南阳邑村领导重点建社，社建成后，便召开区、乡干部大会，请南阳邑农业生产合作社社长陈凤台给大家报告他们建社中如何进行思想发动、学习社章、评土地、劳力、选举干部，以及如何转入农业生产等的经验。干部们听了以后，都找到了建社的办法。第三，用内行人教外行人的办法，帮助不熟悉建社业务的干部和新社干部学习建社的方法。县、区领导互助合作的专职干部，在带动一般干部重点建社时，都耐心地教给他们怎样工作，帮助他们提高办社能力。二区伯延乡工作组在伯延村领导建社时，连次召开全村新旧社的干部联席会议，吸收对建社业务不熟悉的区干部参加，互相研究办社的办法，各取所长，各补所短，丰富办社经验。大家觉着这样作以后，困难问题大大减少了。该村新建和扩建的十数个社，不到半月，便都订出了社章、作好了评土地、劳力等工作，并选出了社的干部。第四，为了全力领导建社工作和春耕生产准备工作，全县最近又抽调了一百七十余名县、区干部，进行训练。在训练时，让大家学习中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”，由县委反复交代建社方针、政策和工作方法，还系统地介绍了北文章社建社的经验。受训练的全体干部，都以批评和自我批评的精神，检查了过去的建社工作，都决心要把农业互助合作运动和农业生产领导好，使自己由外行变成内行。（李守仁）
