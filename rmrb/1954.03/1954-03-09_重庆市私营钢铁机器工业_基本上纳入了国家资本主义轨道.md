    Chongqing Private Iron and Steel Machinery Industry
    Basically Incorporated into the Track of State Capitalism
    The private iron and steel machinery industry in Chongqing has been basically incorporated into the track of state capitalism. There are over one hundred private iron and steel machinery enterprises in Chongqing. With the application of the capitalists and the approval of the government, some have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises, including General Machinery Factory, Chongqing Machine Tool Factory, China Machine Tool Factory, Limin Foundry, Rongtai Machinery Factory, and Chongqing Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory. The remaining factories have undertaken processing orders from the government with the vast majority of their production capacity.
    Before liberation, the private iron and steel machinery industry in Chongqing suffered from chaotic management, blind production, high production costs, and unsalable products. Some factories even ceased production and engaged in commercial speculation on the market. After liberation, the People's Government adopted the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation. Through processing orders, it gradually guided the industry into normal production that was conducive to the development of national construction. Over the past four years, the private iron and steel machinery industry in Chongqing, especially the joint state-private enterprises, has made significant progress in production. For example, before the joint state-private partnership, the Chongqing Machine Tool Factory could not utilize even 30% of its production capacity.
    After the joint state-private partnership, production equipment has increased several times, with eight of the latest large-scale machine tools produced in the Soviet Union alone being added; factory buildings and dormitories have been renovated and expanded, and the workers' living welfare has also been improved. The factory is now developing towards specialized production. Other factories such as Chongqing Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory, Limin Foundry, and Rongtai Machinery Factory have also achieved great development in production after the joint state-private partnership. Factories that have not yet been transformed into joint state-private enterprises have also achieved significant development in production through government processing orders. For example, the Cooperative Hardware and Machinery Manufacturing Factory had only fifty or so workers before liberation, but now has two hundred and ten workers.
    Under the continuous education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the class consciousness of the employees of these enterprises has been continuously improved, and their labor enthusiasm has been increasing day by day. In order to meet the needs of national processing orders, the workers not only strengthened supervision of the capitalists, but also put forward many rationalization proposals, improved production, and reduced costs. For example, in the electroplating workshop of the Cooperative Hardware and Machinery Manufacturing Factory, it cost 6 million yuan to plate one ton of goods in 1950. After workers proposed rationalization suggestions and improved production, it now costs only 3.6 million yuan to plate one ton of goods, reducing costs by 40%. Another example is that in the metalworking workshop in 1952, each person could only process seventy to eighty spindle feet per day. Later, the workers learned the Soviet high-speed cutting method, increasing the number to about 250 spindle feet per person per day. Previously, the government paid 35,000 yuan for processing one spindle foot, but now it only costs 28,000 yuan, a reduction of 20%.

    重庆市私营钢铁机器工业
    基本上纳入了国家资本主义轨道
    重庆市私营钢铁机器工业已基本上纳入国家资本主义轨道。重庆市私营钢铁机器工业共有一百多家，经资方提出申请、政府批准改为公私合营的已有通用机器厂、重庆机床厂、中国机械工具厂、利民翻砂厂、荣泰机器厂、重庆汽车配件制造厂等，其余各厂都以绝大部分生产能力承接政府的加工订货。
    重庆市私营钢铁机器工业，在解放前，经营管理混乱，盲目生产，产品成本高昂，销不出去。有的厂甚至不进行生产，而在市场上作商业投机活动。解放以后，人民政府采取利用、限制、改造政策，通过加工订货，逐步引导该业进入有利于发展国家建设事业的正常生产。四年来，重庆市私营钢铁机器工业、特别是公私合营各厂，在生产上都有显著进步。如重庆机床厂在公私合营以前，生产能力发挥不到百分之三十。
    公私合营以后，生产设备比过去增加了好几倍，单是苏联出产的最新式的大型工作母机就添了八台；厂房、宿舍进行了改建和扩建，工人生活福利也有了改善。现在该厂已在向专业生产方向发展。其他如重庆汽车配件制造厂、利民翻砂厂、荣泰机器厂等，公私合营后，生产上都有了很大发展。尚未公私合营的工厂，经过政府加工订货，生产上也获得了显著发展。如合作五金机器制造厂，解放前厂里只有五十几个工人，现在有工人二百一十人。
    这些企业的职工在共产党和人民政府的不断教育下，阶级觉悟不断提高，劳动热情日益高涨。为满足国家加工订货的需要，工人们不仅对资方加强监督，而且提出许多合理化建议，改进了生产，降低了成本。如合作五金机器制造厂电镀车间一九五零年镀一吨活要六百万元，经工人提合理化建议改进生产以后，现在镀一吨活只需三百六十万元，降低成本百分之四十。又如金工车间一九五二年车锭脚每人每天只能车七、八十个，后来工人们学习了苏联高速切削法，提高到每人每天能车二百五十个左右。以前车一个锭脚，政府所付加工费为三万五千元，现在只需二万八千元，降低百分之二十。
