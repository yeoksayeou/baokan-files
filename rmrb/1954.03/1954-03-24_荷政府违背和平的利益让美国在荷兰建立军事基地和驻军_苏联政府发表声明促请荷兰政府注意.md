Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, March 23rd: TASS reports: On March 18th, the Soviet Ambassador to the Netherlands, S.P. Kirsanov, visited the Dutch Foreign Minister Luns and, following instructions from the Soviet government, delivered the following statement:

“Dutch newspapers recently published a statement by the Dutch Defense Minister, Mr. Staf, saying that the Dutch government has agreed to allow the United States to establish air force bases and station air force personnel on Dutch territory.

“It is quite obvious that allowing the stationing of U.S. armed forces on Dutch territory in peacetime has nothing to do with the defense of the Netherlands, because the Netherlands is not, in fact, threatened by anyone. At a time when everyone is working to ease international tensions and strengthen peace, this action by the Dutch government is particularly unjustified.

“The Soviet government attaches great importance to the cause of strengthening peace and ensuring collective security in Europe, and therefore believes it necessary to urge the Dutch government to pay attention to the fact that granting military bases to foreign countries and stationing foreign troops on Dutch territory cannot promote the improvement of the international situation and international relations.”

Luns said that the Dutch government would consider the Soviet government's statement and then respond.

    荷政府违背和平的利益让美国在荷兰建立军事基地和驻军
    苏联政府发表声明促请荷兰政府注意
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社海牙讯：三月十八日，苏联驻荷兰大使斯·普·基尔萨诺夫往访荷兰外交大臣伦斯，并且遵照苏联政府的指示发表声明如下：
    “荷兰报纸最近刊载了荷兰国防大臣斯塔夫先生的声明，说荷兰政府已经同意让美国在荷兰领土上建立空军基地和驻扎空军。
    “十分明显，在和平时期让美国武装部队驻扎在荷兰领土上，是和荷兰的国防毫不相干的，因为事实上荷兰并没有受到任何方面的威胁。目前大家正在努力缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平，在这个时候，荷兰政府的这种行动就尤其没有理由。
    “苏联政府非常重视加强和平与保障欧洲集体安全的事业，因此认为必须促请荷兰政府注意：以军事基地让与外国并在荷兰领土上驻扎外国军队，根本不能促进国际形势和国际关系的改善。”
    伦斯说，荷兰政府将考虑苏联政府的声明然后作复。
