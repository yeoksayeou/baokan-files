Xinhua News Agency, Khmer, March 21st: Khomani, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Khmer Resistance Government, issued a statement on March 20th, protesting the interference of US imperialists in Cambodia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	For the past few years, US imperialists have been intensifying their assistance to the French colonialists with money and weapons in carrying out a disastrous war of aggression in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos.

	Due to US aid to the French colonialists, thousands of Khmer people have been massacred or forcibly conscripted into the puppet army by the French colonialists. People in many areas have been concentrated and are suffering from poverty and disease, and many have died. Some pagodas, villages, and people's crops in Battambang Province, Kampot Province, Prey Veng Province, Svay Rieng Province, and Kampong Cham Province have been burned or destroyed.

	The Khmer people have risen up and fought for national liberation for more than eight years. The Khmer Resistance Government controls a large part of the country, and the living conditions of the people in the liberated areas have been improved.

	However, the French and US imperialists are colluding more and more closely with the puppet and reactionary forces now headed by King Norodom Sihanouk, attempting to turn Cambodia into a base to prolong the war of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The French and US imperialists have staged a farce of "independence" and established a puppet army to deceive and massacre the Khmer people.

	However, the Khmer people only recognize the Khmer Resistance Government as the sole government representing the entire country and all the people of Cambodia.

	In February 1954, the French colonialist Navarre's military plan was severely打击打击击 by the heroic Vietnamese, Khmer, and Lao people. The US government openly dispatched US Air Force personnel to Indochina to directly massacre the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

	On behalf of the Khmer Resistance Government and the people, I strongly protest the US government's interference. We see that this action by the US government directly infringes upon the independence and freedom of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and at the same time, further threatens peace in Asia and the world.

	The Khmer people, like the Vietnamese and Lao people, welcome the convening of the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The Khmer Resistance Government and the people fully endorse and support the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 8, 1954, which stated that the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fully support the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference's proposal to convene the Geneva Conference on April 26, 1954, and are willing to fight to the end to restore a peaceful life for the people of Indochina.

	Ending the war in Indochina is in line with the wishes of the people of Indochina. This is an issue that must be resolved in order to ease international tensions in accordance with the wishes of peace-loving people of all countries.

	The Khmer people are closely united around the Resistance Government headed by Chairman Sơn Ngọc Minh, and united with the people of Vietnam and Laos. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, they are determined to fight for true independence and freedom, and will surely achieve true independence and freedom.

    抗议美国在印度支那的干涉行动
   【新华社二十二日讯】越南通讯社高棉二十一日讯：高棉抗战政府外交部部长高玛尼二十日发表声明，抗议美帝国主义者在高棉的干涉行动。声明全文如下：
    过去几年中，美帝国主义者一直以金钱和武器加紧帮助法国殖民者在高棉、越南和寮国进行灾难性的侵略战争。
    由于美国给法国殖民者的援助，数以千计的高棉人民遭到了屠杀或被法国殖民者强迫征入伪军。许多地区的人民被集中起来，遭受着穷困和疾病的痛苦，许多人已经死去。马德望省、唝吥省、波萝勉省、柴桢省、磅湛省的一些宝塔、村庄和人民的庄稼被焚毁或破坏。
    高棉人民已奋起为民族解放进行了八年多的斗争。高棉抗战政府控制着全国的很大一部分地方，解放区人民的生活条件得到了改善。
    但是，法、美帝国主义者与现在以西哈努克国王为首的傀儡和反动派日益紧密地串通一气，企图把高棉变成一个基地来延长在越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争。法、美帝国主义者导演了一幕“独立”丑剧，成立了伪军来欺骗和屠杀高棉人民。
    但是，高棉人民只承认高棉抗战政府是代表高棉整个国家和全体人民的唯一政府。
    一九五四年二月，法国殖民者纳瓦尔的军事计划遭到英雄的越南、高棉和寮国人民的沉重打击，美国政府就公开派遣美国空军人员到印度支那来直接屠杀越南、高棉和寮国人民。
    我代表高棉抗战政府和人民强硬抗议美国政府的干涉。我们看到美国政府的这种行动直接侵犯了越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的独立和自由，同时，进一步威胁到亚洲和全世界的和平。
    高棉人民像越南和寮国人民同样地欢迎召开日内瓦会议，以便讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题。高棉抗战政府和人民完全拥护并支持越南民主共和国外交部部长一九五四年三月八日的声明，声明说：越南、高棉、寮国三国人民完全支持柏林四国外长会议关于在一九五四年四月二十六日召开日内瓦会议的建议，并愿为恢复印度支那人民的和平生活而奋斗到底。
    停止印度支那战争是符合于印度支那人民的愿望的。这是一个根据各国爱好和平人民的愿望缓和国际紧张局势必须解决的问题。
    高棉人民紧密地团结在以山玉明主席为首的抗战政府的周围，和越南及寮国人民团结在一起，在全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，决心为真正的独立和自由而奋斗，并且一定会得到真正的独立和自由。
