    Warm Greetings, Great Encouragement
    – Excerpts from the Activities of the Sixth Sub-Delegation of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army
    Li Ying
    The good news spread like a spring breeze. From the high mountains and steep ridges of the Taihang Mountains to the vast plains of central Hebei, from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the shores of the Bohai Sea, wherever there were People's Liberation Army soldiers, the arrival of the good news immediately filled the air with a festive atmosphere. These were truly extraordinary days. Look, magnificent arches were being erected, smooth roads were being repaired, exhibition halls were being decorated everywhere, and gifts were being prepared to be sent to loved ones. This was the garrison of an anti-aircraft unit. It was two o'clock in the morning, and the lights were still on, as the soldiers were designing an exhibition hall for their loved ones to see. Cui Weizhe, a soldier from a unit guarding the capital, gave up his Sunday rest to practice his shooting skills diligently, and as a result, he scored 29 rings with three shots. He said, "I want to dedicate this achievement to my loved ones." Li Wenxiu, a soldier from a unit guarding a certain coastline, wrote in a letter to his loved ones: "We have been looking forward to your arrival day and night. Even if all the trees in the world were turned into pens, all the water in the world were turned into ink, and all the people in the world were turned into writers, we could not fully express our gratitude!"
    The delegation finally arrived, and many days of anticipation instantly turned into great jubilation. In Zhangjiakou, the crowds welcoming the delegation stretched from the Liberation Hotel all the way to the railway station. On a certain coastal defense position, the delegates were lifted high by the soldiers who were cheering on both sides of the road. In Baoding, a grand welcoming meeting of 15,000 people was held. Wherever the loved ones went, it was an ocean of joy. Petals of flowers were scattered from the air, bouquets of flowers were thrown from the crowds, passionate applause and cheers, warm handshakes and embraces, excited faces, words of gratitude, cordial inquiries, and solemn promises.
    Everywhere, one could see scenes like this: those labor models with chests full of medals, those Young Pioneers with red scarves around their necks, speaking kindly and sincerely to the soldiers: "You have worked hard! Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country care about you." And those soldiers, all with rosy cheeks and radiant spirits, raised their arms and shouted excitedly: "We serve the people, long live Chairman Mao!"
    At a banquet, Zhang Xiaocai, a first-class meritorious soldier from a certain unit, met Yang Yupu, the father of his close comrade-in-arms, the martyr Yang Lian, the hero. He ran up and tightly grasped the old man's hand. At that moment, he remembered the scene in 1951 when he attended the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and lived with Yang Lian, hero, and went to see Chairman Mao together, and he remembered the grief he felt when Yang Lian heroically sacrificed himself in Korea in May 1952. For a moment, he couldn't think of appropriate words of affection to say, and after a pause, he said, "Uncle, is your whole family well?" Old Man Yang replied with a smile, "Even if it's just a little rain, the government leaders will still go to check if our house is leaking. There's nothing else to say. Everyone calls me the father of a hero and calls your aunt the mother of a hero. The people have given us this honor, and we can't let them down. I must become a labor model, and I hope that you will also make great contributions in defending socialist construction." As Zhang Xiaocai listened, he felt waves of excitement in his heart, but for a moment he couldn't think of appropriate words to express his feelings. He only said these two sentences: "Uncle, don't worry! We will fight and work like Comrade Lian."
    At a forum, Shan Jitao, a delegate from the delegation, a Young Pioneer, spoke to the soldiers with infinite gratitude and respect: "Our school has newly built beautiful buildings, where we study quietly and comfortably. During National Day, we can sing and dance to our hearts' content in front of Tiananmen Square. When we think of our happy and joyful lives, we naturally think of the PLA uncles who guard the gate of the motherland day and night! If it weren't for you, where would we be today! Dear uncles, let me represent the Young Pioneers of the whole country and salute you!" At another forum, the soldiers were telling their loved ones about their feelings of gratitude to the motherland and the people. Wu Zhenguo, a combat hero and specially meritorious soldier, spoke, saying, "Without Chairman Mao, without the people, there would be no us. When suppressing bandits in a certain area, we were unfamiliar with the people and the place. If it weren't for the help of the masses, how could I have captured the bandit leader Zhang Dawen and made a special contribution! A year ago, I was still illiterate and couldn't even recognize my own name. Today, I am actually sitting in the classroom doing algebra and geometry problems. The glory should go to the people of the whole country, and the glory should go to Chairman Mao."
    That was at a comforting meeting of the armored forces, and the soldiers listened intently to the report of Dai Yuzhang, the director of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Second District of Datong City. The affluent living conditions of the cooperative members greatly attracted the soldiers. When Dai Yuzhang talked about how their entire cooperative planned to sell 80,000 jin of surplus grain to support national industrialization, but ended up completing more than 200,000 jin, the conference hall erupted in long and continuous applause. After the meeting, the soldiers expressed one after another that they would better study the general line, publicize the general line, improve their military technology, and defend the great motherland that is transitioning to socialism. At a comforting forum of an anti-aircraft unit, Zhang Deshan, a worker who had improved tools three times, increased production by more than 30 times, saved the country more than 1 billion yuan in wealth, and was twice rated as a first-class labor model, met with Yang Yinzhuang, the battalion chief of staff who had made two major contributions, and the meritorious representatives of his regiment. Heroes and models meeting each other was particularly moving, and they poured out their feelings to each other. Zhang Deshan said, "Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country sent me to comfort you, what an honor it is for me! I am just an ordinary worker. From the age of twelve, I was an apprentice in a capitalist factory and began a life worse than that of an ox or a horse, a dark and hopeless life. After liberation, I saw the blue sky, and I began to work for myself. Producing more and better things is the ideal of every worker. I was researching and improving a tool, once, twice, and four times in a row, I failed. I was both anxious and discouraged, but when I thought of Dong Cunrui, the PLA hero who sacrificed himself to blow up the bunker, and Huang Jiguang, the volunteer army hero who used his body to block the enemy's firing point, I gained an endless force, and the difficulties were finally overcome by me. The fifth experiment, the tool I researched was successful. This should not be my personal achievement, this is the encouragement of your heroic behavior." At this time, a burst of warm applause rang out in the conference hall, and then Comrade Yang Yinzhuang said with emotion: "In you, we see the excellent qualities of the working class, we see the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for selfless labor in building the socialist motherland, we see the hearts of the people of the whole country! You are our example, we must learn the spirit of the working class and become heroes who defend the motherland and defend world peace."
    At the forum, the meritorious soldiers of the entire regiment expressed their expectations and determination to their loved ones: Let's build our motherland into a great socialist country as soon as possible! We will definitely protect her well. At this time, Zhang Deshan raised his strong arm and said like he was taking an oath: "I will definitely tell Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country what you mean, and I, on behalf of the workers of the whole country, guarantee to you: we will definitely increase production like Wang Chonglun, improve quality, and complete production plans ahead of schedule and exceed them. In the near future, we will send more airplanes, artillery, tanks, and warships made by our own hands to you, so that our army will become an invincible army and our national defense will become a steel defense. Comrades, let us join hands and advance side by side on the road of socialist construction in the motherland!"

    热烈的慰问，巨大的鼓舞
    ——全国人民慰问解放军代表团第六总分团活动片断
    黎莹
    喜讯像一股春风，到处传开了。从太行山的高山峻岭到冀中大平原，从内蒙古草原到渤海之滨，凡是有人民解放军的地方，随着喜讯的到来，立刻充满了节日一样的气氛。这真是些不平常的日子。看吧，一座座壮丽的彩门搭起来了，一条条溜光的马路修起来了，到处在布置展览馆，到处在准备送给亲人的礼品。这是防空部队某部的驻地，夜两点了，灯还亮着，战士们正在设计给亲人看的展览馆。警卫首都的某部战士崔维哲放弃了星期日的休息，苦练射击技术，结果三枪打了二十九环，他说：“我要把这成绩献给亲人。”守卫在某地海岸线上的某部战士李文秀，在给亲人的一封信上写着：“日盼夜盼，可把你们盼来了。让天下的树都变成笔，让天下的水都变成墨，让天下的人都变成作家，也写不尽我的感激心情！”
    慰问团终于来了，多日的期待，一下变成了巨大的欢腾。在张家口，欢迎代表团的人群从解放饭店一直排到火车站；在某地海防阵地上，代表们被夹道欢呼的战士们高高地举起来；在保定，开了一万五千人的盛大欢迎会。亲人们走到那里，那里就是欢乐的海洋，一片片的花屑从空中洒下来，一束束的鲜花从人丛中抛过来，激情的鼓掌和欢呼，热烈的握手和拥抱，兴奋的脸孔，感激的话语，亲切的询问，庄严的保证。
    到处都可以看到这样的情景：那些胸前挂满纪念章的劳动模范，那些脖子里系着红领巾的少先队员，亲切地诚挚地对战士说：“你们辛苦了！毛主席和全国人民关心着你们。”而那些个个红光满面精神焕发的战士则举着臂膀激奋地高呼：“我们为人民服务，毛主席万岁！”
    在一次宴会上，某部一等功臣张孝才会见了他的亲密战友杨连第烈士的父亲杨玉璞老大爷，他跑上去紧紧地握住老大爷的手，在这一刹那间，他想起了一九五一年在北京列席中国政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议时和杨连第一起居住一起去看毛主席的情景，他又想起了一九五二年五月杨连第在朝鲜英勇牺牲时悲痛的心情。他一时想不出适当的亲切的话来说，停了一下，他才说道：“大爷，咱全家都好吧！”杨老大爷微笑着回答：“天下点小雨，政府首长还要去看看咱家的房子漏了没有；别的就不用说了。人人都叫我是英雄的父亲，称你大妈是英雄的母亲，人民给咱这份荣誉，咱可不能对不起。我一定要当个劳动模范，希望你们也在保卫社会主义建设中立大功。”张孝才听着听着，心里一阵阵地激动，但一时也想不出适当的语言来表达自己的心情。他只说了这么两句：“大爷，放心吧！我们会向连第同志一样去战斗和工作的。”
    在一个座谈会上，慰问团代表、少年先锋队员单济涛怀着无限感激崇敬的心情向战士们诉说着：“我们学校新盖了美丽的大楼，我们在那里安安静静舒舒服服地学习着，国庆节时，我们可以在天安门前尽情地歌唱，尽情地舞蹈，我们一想起自己幸福愉快的生活，也就很自然地想起了日夜守卫着祖国大门的解放军叔叔们！要不是有你们，我们那有今天！亲爱的叔叔，让我代表全国的少年先锋队员向叔叔们敬礼吧！”在另一个座谈会上，战士们又在向亲人们叙述自己对祖国、对人民的感激的心情了。战斗英雄、特等功臣吴振国发言了，他说：“没有毛主席，没有人民，就没有我们。在某地剿匪时，人地两生，要不是群众的帮助，我怎能活捉匪首张大汶立了特等功呢！一年以前，我还是个连自己名字都不认识的文盲，今天，我居然坐在课堂上做起代数和几何的题目了。光荣应归全国人民，光荣应归毛主席。”
    那是在装甲兵部队的慰问大会上，战士们出神地听着大同市第二区陈家庄农业生产合作社社长戴玉章的报告。该社社员生活的富裕景况，大大吸引了战士们。当戴玉章谈到他们全社为了支援国家工业化，原计划出卖余粮八万斤，结果完成了二十余万斤的时候，会场上暴发了经久不停的掌声。会后战士们纷纷表示：要更好地学习总路线，宣传总路线，提高军事技术，保卫向社会主义过渡的伟大的祖国。在防空部队某部的慰问座谈会上，三次改进工具、使生产提高了三十多倍、为国家节约财富十亿多元、两次被评为一等劳动模范的工人张德山和立过两次大功的营参谋长杨印庄以及他所在那个团的功臣代表们会见了。英雄和模范相见，格外动人，互相倾吐着自己的心情。张德山说：“毛主席和全国人民派我来慰问你们，我是多么荣幸啊！我只是个普通的工人，十二岁起，就在资本家工厂当学徒，开始了牛马不如暗无天日的生活。解放了，我看见了青天，我开始为自己工作了，生产更多、更好的东西，这是我们每一个工人的理想。我在研究改进一种工具，一次，两次，一连四次都失败了，我又焦躁，又气馁，但当我想到舍身炸碉堡的解放军英雄董存瑞，想到用自己的身体堵住敌人火力点的志愿军英雄黄继光时，我的身上就增加了一股无穷的力量，困难终于被我克服了，第五次试验，我研究的工具成功了。这不应该是我个人的成绩，这是你们的英雄行为的鼓舞。”这时会场上响起了一片热烈的掌声，接着杨印庄同志感动地说：“在你的身上，我们看到了工人阶级的优秀品质，看到了全国人民为建设社会主义祖国而忘我劳动的热情，看到了全国人民的心！你就是我们的榜样，我们一定要学习工人阶级这种精神，成为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的英雄。”
    座谈会上，全团功臣向亲人们表示了自己的期望和决心：早日把我们祖国建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家吧！我们一定好好保卫着她。这时张德山举起了他那粗壮的胳臂像宣誓一样说：“我一定把你们的心意告诉毛主席，告诉全国人民，我代表全国工人向你们保证： 一定像王崇伦一样，增加产量，提高质量，提前和超额完成生产计划。不久的将来，我们将把我们亲手造的更多的飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰送到你们手里，让我们的军队成为无敌的军队，让我们的国防成为钢铁的国防。同志们，让我们在祖国社会主义建设的大道上，携手并肩前进吧！”
