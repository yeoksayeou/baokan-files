Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Recently, Western European capitalist countries such as Britain and France have strengthened their activities and demands for expanding East-West trade.

    On February 25th, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons during a debate on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, advocating for a "significant relaxation" of the scope of trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies. He said: "Exchanging goods and services on an increasingly larger scale is beneficial without any drawbacks." According to Reuters, immediately after Churchill's speech, the British Department of Trade announced that it would resume trade negotiations between Britain and Hungary in London on March 15th, which had been interrupted in 1949; trade negotiations between Britain and Poland began in London on March 4th; and arrangements are also being made for trade negotiations with Czechoslovakia.

    As we know, at the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Conference held in January this year, representatives of the Commonwealth countries believed that measures must be taken to counter the U.S.'s restrictive trade policies in order to recover Britain's unstable export position and prevent the impact of the U.S. economic crisis. Since that conference, calls within Britain for opening up trade with the vast markets of the peace and democracy camp have been increasing. Many British companies have eagerly sent representatives to countries in the peace and democracy camp to negotiate trade contracts or conduct preliminary consultations. The urgent demand of British businessmen to find outlets for goods has forced British officials to take a proactive attitude.

    In France, activities to expand trade between East and West are also increasing. During the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, a French trade delegation was negotiating in Moscow. According to a Reuters report on February 26th, citing French officials, France plans to significantly increase exports to countries in the peace and democracy camp and estimates that the volume of Franco-Soviet trade will double in the next eighteen months. The report continued that France would request the expansion of trade with the peace and democracy camp at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe meeting to be held in April, and Britain and other Western European countries would support France's request. The report also stated that France would soon hold trade negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania, and the term of the trade treaty between France and Czechoslovakia would also be extended.

    A Reuters report on the same day stated that Belgian economic experts expressed that Belgium hopes to conduct more trade with the East and hopes to sell "any goods other than weapons." Belgian industrialists and businessmen hope to offset the decline in exports to the United States due to high U.S. tariffs and competition by increasing trade with the East. According to the Danish "News," the Danish Industrial Council recommended to the Danish Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 3rd to expand trade with the Soviet Union.

    Italian industrialists, businessmen, and economic experts held a "Strive for Free Development of Foreign Trade" conference in Genoa on January 30th, opposing the U.S. Battle Act and advocating for expanding the scope of trade to alleviate Italy's economic crisis.

    Since the United States used the Korean War to implement its "embargo" policy, the foreign trade of Western European countries, which have traditionally had economic ties with countries in the peace and democracy camp, has been greatly restricted, resulting in a series of economic difficulties. As the situation eases, these countries are increasingly eager to break free from the "embargo" shackles imposed on them by the United States, to prevent their economies from falling into a more serious crisis. Currently, the pressure formed by this demand has reached such a degree that, according to a United Press report, a body composed of representatives from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries as well as West Germany and Japan, which controls East-West trade, will meet in Paris to re-examine the list of "embargoed" goods and consider relaxing restrictions on East-West trade.

### 西欧各国急于挣脱美国的“禁运”枷锁  正寻求各种方法扩展和东方的贸易关系

    西欧各国急于挣脱美国的“禁运”枷锁
    正寻求各种方法扩展和东方的贸易关系
    【新华社六日讯】近来，英法等西欧资本主义国家加强了它们对于扩展东西方贸易的活动和要求。
    二月二十五日，英国首相邱吉尔在下院就柏林四国外长会议的结果进行辩论时发表演说，主张“大大放宽”对苏联和东欧人民民主国家贸易的范围。他说：“在越来越大的规模上交换商品和劳务，是有利无弊的。”据路透社的消息说，就在邱吉尔发表演说之后，英国贸易部已宣布在三月十五日在伦敦恢复于一九四九年陷于中断的英国与匈牙利之间的贸易谈判；英国与波兰的贸易谈判已在三月四日在伦敦开始；与捷克斯洛伐克举行贸易谈判的事情也在安排中。
    大家知道，在今年一月间召开的英联邦财政部长会议上，英联邦各国代表认为必须采取措施，对付美国的限制贸易的政策以挽回英国不稳的出口地位，并防止美国经济危机的影响。从那次会议以来，英国国内要求打开与和平民主阵营广大市场贸易的呼声已愈来愈高。许多英国公司已迫不及待地派出代表到和平民主阵营国家谈判贸易合同或作初步洽商。英国商人寻找货物出路的迫切要求，使得英国官方不得不采取积极的态度。
    在法国，扩大东西方之间贸易的活动也在增加。就在柏林四外长会议期间，就有一个法国贸易代表团在莫斯科进行谈判。据路透社二月二十六日电引法国官方人士的消息说，法国计划大力增加对和平民主阵营国家的输出，并估计在今后十八个月内，法苏贸易额将增加一倍。消息接着说，法国将在四月间举行的联合国欧洲经济委员会的会议上，要求扩大对和平民主阵营的贸易，而英国及其他西欧国家都将支持法国的要求。消息还说，法国不久即将与保加利亚和罗马尼亚举行贸易谈判，法国与捷克斯洛伐克的贸易条约的期限也要予以延长。
    路透社同日的一则消息说，比利时的经济专家表示，比利时希望和东方进行更多的贸易，并且希望出售“武器之外的任何货物”。比利时工商业家希望用增加对东方的贸易来抵销由于美国的高额关税和竞争结果对美国出口的下降。另据丹麦“新闻报”报道，丹麦工业理事会三月三日向丹麦商务部和外交部建议扩展对苏联的贸易。
    意大利的工商界人士与经济专家一月三十日在热那亚举行了一次“争取自由发展对外贸易”大会，反对美国的巴特尔法，主张扩大贸易范围，以解救意大利的经济危机。
    自从美国利用朝鲜战争推行“禁运”政策以来，在经济上一向与和平民主阵营国家有传统的交往的西欧国家的对外贸易受到很大限制，从而造成了一系列经济上的困难。随着局势趋于缓和，这些国家日益急于挣脱美国强加在它们身上的“禁运”枷锁，以免它们的经济陷入更加严重的危机。目前，这种要求所形成的压力已达到这样的程度，据合众社的消息说，由北大西洋集团国家以及西德和日本代表所组成的一个控制东西方贸易的机构即将在巴黎开会，重新审查“禁运”货物的清单，考虑放宽对东西方贸易的限制。
