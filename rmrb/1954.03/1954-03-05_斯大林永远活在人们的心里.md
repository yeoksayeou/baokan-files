    Stalin Lives Forever in People's Hearts
    Hua Luogeng
    On March 5, 1953, the heart of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great teacher of the world communist movement, stopped beating. That was the very day our delegation from the Chinese Academy of Sciences arrived in Moscow.
    We were immersed in immense grief. We remembered that ten days before, when we left the capital of our motherland, we were always thinking and talking about it: this visit to the Soviet Union, spending May Day in Moscow, we would have the opportunity to see Stalin, whom we most admired and longed to meet. If we could see this savior of mankind, even from a distance, even briefly, it would be considered the greatest happiness of our lives. But who knew that on the very first day of our arrival in Moscow, we would encounter this immense misfortune, and the working people of the world would never have the opportunity to see Stalin's face and hear his voice and laughter again. Grief overflowed in the hearts of each of us; some mourned in silence, others swore an oath to strive to complete Stalin's great cause. Thus, we spent the most unfortunate days together with the Soviet people.
    We visited the Soviet Union with extreme grief. During this period, we felt more and more deeply that Stalin had not died; although he had stopped breathing, he was still alive, living in the hearts of everyone. From the happy smiling faces of Soviet children, we saw Stalin; in the prosperous and peaceful Soviet countryside, we saw Stalin; in countless factories and mines, we saw Stalin; on the great construction sites of communism, we also saw Stalin. What moved us the most was that we could see Stalin from the depths of the minds of every excellent Soviet scientist. Stalin was not only alive, but also living everywhere; he was still driving everything forward, he was still leading everything.
    Not only in the Soviet Union, but throughout the world, wherever there are working people, Joseph Vissarionovich is with them, wherever there is a struggle against exploitation and enslavement, there is Stalin's voice. Although Stalin had never been to China, and the Kremlin was separated from China by thousands of mountains and rivers, everyone felt that he was with us. His theories are the source of our strength; the history of his leadership in building socialism in the Soviet Union is a model for our country's construction. Although he is no longer in the world today, he still encourages and guides China's revolutionary cause. Every working person in the world feels that Stalin is with them, he symbolizes freedom, liberation, and a happy life.
    It has been a year since Stalin's death! But we still feel that he is alive, leading us with great strength, just as we did in the past. Malenkov said at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "For the Soviet government and for all of us Soviet people, the cause of consolidating peace and ensuring the security of all peoples is not a matter of tactics or diplomatic skill. This is our general line in foreign policy." Hearing these words from a believer reminded us of what the deceased teacher said in April 1952, in response to questions raised by a group of American newspaper editors, he said: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then peaceful coexistence between capitalism and communism is entirely possible."
    Molotov's speech at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, firmly supporting the convening of a Five-Power Conference, deeply moved every Chinese person, and also reminded us of Stalin's deeply moving last message: "The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a reliable safeguard against the threat of new aggression, and a strong bastion of peace in the Far East and the world."
    Stalin's concern for the Chinese people is inexhaustible. Especially today, as we are implementing socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union is helping us build 141 large-scale projects, giving us the conditions to reach socialism at an early date. This again makes us very moved to recall what Stalin said in his great work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "No capitalist country can provide the people's democratic countries with genuine help and technically proficient help as the Soviet Union does. The problem is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is first and foremost that the basis of this cooperation is mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic advancement."
    Stalin lives forever in the hearts of everyone. Today, we often meet him, learning from the words he taught; in the future, in our work that is becoming more and more complex every day, we will surely meet him more frequently. Especially scientific workers, when seeking truth, will surely meet him anytime and anywhere. What Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin represent is truth, and truth is immortal! Therefore, Stalin will forever live in people's hearts.

    斯大林永远活在人们的心里
    华罗庚
    一九五三年三月五日，世界共产主义运动的伟大导师约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的心脏停止了跳动。那正是我们中国科学院访苏代表团到达莫斯科的当天。
    我们沉浸在万分悲痛里。我们想起了十天之前，在离开祖国首都的时候，我们一直在想着，一直在谈着：这一次访问苏联，将在莫斯科度过“五一”劳动节，我们将有机会看到我们所最敬爱的渴望能见一面的斯大林。如果我们能见到这人类的救星，哪怕是十分远，十分短暂，也将被认为生平最大的幸福。但谁知道在我们到达莫斯科的第一天，就遭遇到这万分的不幸，全世界的劳动人民再也没有机会看到斯大林的音容笑貌了。悲痛漫溢在我们每一个人的心头，有人在默哀，有人在起誓，起誓为完成斯大林的伟大事业而奋斗。就这样，我们和苏联人民在一起，共同地度过了最不幸的日子。
    我们怀着极度的悲痛访问了苏联。在这期间，我们愈来愈深切地感到斯大林并没有死，他虽然停止了呼吸，但是他仍然活着，活在每一个人的心中。从苏联儿童的幸福笑脸上，我们看到了斯大林；在富裕和平的苏联农村中，我们看到了斯大林；在数不清的工厂矿山里，我们看到了斯大林；在伟大的共产主义建设工地上，我们也看到了斯大林。最使我们感动的是：从每一个苏联的优秀的科学家的思想深处，我们都可以看到斯大林。斯大林不但活着，并且还无处不在地活着，他依然推动着一切，他依然领导着一切。
    不仅在苏联，而且在全世界，凡是有劳动人民的所在，就有约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇和他们同在，凡是有反剥削反奴役的斗争的场所，就有斯大林的声音。斯大林虽然没有到过中国，克里姆林宫虽然和中国隔了万水千山，但谁都体会到他是和我们同在的。他的学说是我们力量的源泉；他领导苏联建成社会主义的历史，是我国建设的榜样。虽然他今天已不在人间，但他还是鼓舞着和指导着中国的革命事业。全世界每一个劳动人民都体会到斯大林是和他们同在的，他象征着自由解放和幸福生活。
    斯大林逝世一年了！但我们仍然和以往一样，处处都体会到他是活着的，他还在极坚强地领导着我们。马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次常会上说：“对苏联政府，对我们全体苏联人民说来：巩固和平和保证各国人民安全的事业不是一个策略或外交手腕的问题。这就是我们在对外政策方面的总路线。”听了这出自笃信的话，使我们想到已去世的导师在一九五二年四月答复一批美国报纸编辑所提出的问题时说的话，他说：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那么资本主义与共产主义的和平共处就是十分可能的。”
    莫洛托夫在柏林的四国外长会议席上坚决地支持召开五大国会议的发言，使每一个中国人民都深深感激，同时也使我们回忆起斯大林的感人极深的遗言：“苏联和中华人民共和国之间的伟大友谊是反对新侵略威胁的可靠保证，是远东及全世界和平的坚强堡垒。”
    斯大林对中国人民的关怀，是说不完的。特别是在我们实行社会主义工业化的今天，苏联帮助我们建设一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，使我们有条件能早日到达社会主义。这又使我们十分感动地想起斯大林在他伟大的著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所说的话：“没有一个资本主义国家能像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”
    斯大林永远活在每一个人的心里。在今天，我们常常遇见他，从他所教导的言辞中学习；在将来，在我们一天比一天更繁杂的工作中，一定会更频繁地遇见他。特别是科学工作者，在寻求真理的时候，一定会随时随地地都遇见他。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所代表的就是真理，真理不朽！因之斯大林也就永远地活在人们的心里。
