Comrades! The Soviet people are greeting the election day of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR with firm confidence, firmly believing that the policy of their beloved Communist Party to strengthen the unbreakable worker-peasant alliance and further develop the productive forces to ensure the improvement of the material and cultural level of the people is correct. On election day, Communists and non-Party people will once again demonstrate that they are united around the Communist Party, which is closely connected with the people and devotes all its strength to continuing economic and cultural construction.

The reason why the entire Soviet people unanimously supports the Communist Party and the Soviet government is that in our socialist country, the power is held by workers and peasants, by people engaged in labor and science, and by representatives of all strata of people who protect the vital interests of the working people.

Four years have passed since the last election to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. During these four years, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have made great achievements in further developing industry, agriculture, science, technology, and all sectors of the national economy. The Soviet people completed the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, sparing no effort and labor, and selflessly striving to realize the grand plan of communist construction.

The 19th Party Congress defined the path of development of the Soviet Union in the directives on the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Last year, industry and agriculture were further developed, national income increased, and the material and cultural level of the people improved. The total industrial output increased to 2.5 times that of the pre-war year 1940. While fully developing the entire socialist economy, the government and the Party are paying attention to the fact that priority should still be given to the development of heavy industry, because heavy industry was and still is the foundation for the prosperity of the entire national economy. Last year, heavy industry made great achievements in increasing steel production, mining coal and oil, and electricity. The Soviet machine-building industry, which manufactures the most advanced and modern machines, lathes, and equipment, is rapidly growing and developing. The machines and equipment manufactured by machine-building enterprises increased by about four times that of the pre-war year 1940.

While developing heavy industry as the foundation of the socialist economy, the Party and the government have not forgotten the industrial sectors that produce daily necessities. The Communist Party is rapidly developing light industry in order to greatly increase the supply of industrial products and food to residents in the next two or three years. In 1953, light industry developed faster, producing 12 percent more products than in 1952. The production of silk fabrics, wool fabrics and linen fabrics, knitted underwear, socks, vegetable oil, margarine, macaroni and other daily necessities exceeded the plan. But this is not enough. We have all the conditions to develop the production of daily necessities to fully meet the growing needs of residents.

The Party and the government not only make light industry strive to increase the quantity of goods, but also to improve the quality of goods. Light industry should produce strong, beautiful, and high-quality goods. Workers, engineers, technicians, and staff of daily necessities industry and food industry enterprises should respond to this call of the Party and further expand the socialist competition to complete the production plan of each enterprise ahead of schedule.

Our collective farms and state farms have also achieved great success. In the post-war period, the sown area and the yield per unit area of ​​major crops have exceeded the pre-war level. The tractors, combines, machines, and farm tools equipped for agriculture are now more and better than before the war. These achievements are undeniable, but our requirements are more than that. The current level of development of machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms cannot meet the growing needs of residents and light industry for food and raw materials. The Party and the government have formulated a plan to rapidly improve agriculture. This plan is embodied in the resolutions of the September Plenary Session, as well as some resolutions made by the Party and the government in agriculture later. Our urgent task is to fully develop the basis of the entire agricultural production – grain, rapidly improve the livestock industry, and ensure that in two or three years, the production of potatoes and vegetables can not only fully meet the needs of urban residents, industrial centers, and processing industries, but also meet the needs of the livestock industry.

In order to complete this task, the Party and the government have supplied agriculture with skilled cadres and all material and technical foundations. Last year, machine tractor stations and state farms received 139,000 general-purpose tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower), 18,000 row-crop tractors, 41,000 grain harvesting combines, 69,000 trucks, and more than 2 million farm tools and machines. The Party and the government paid great attention to strengthening machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms. Machine tractor stations now have about 1.25 million tractor drivers, tractor team leaders and deputy leaders, and operators of complex agricultural machines. A large number of skilled engineers, technicians, agronomists, and livestock breeders with rich knowledge and work experience have been transferred from industrial sectors and other sectors of the national economy to the countryside.

The persevering efforts of agricultural workers to implement the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee have had a positive impact on the improvement of the agricultural level. In the autumn of 1953, collective farms and state farms cultivated 13 million hectares more autumn-ploughed land and 3.5 million hectares more autumn-ploughed fallow land than in the previous year. The number of livestock and the amount of meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products purchased and acquired have increased significantly.

The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party formulated a very important national task: to reclaim at least 13 million hectares of wasteland and virgin land from 1954 to 1955 to expand the grain sown area, and to harvest 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion poods of grain on these lands by 1955, of which 800 million to 900 million poods are commercial grain. The work of reclaiming wasteland and virgin land is mainly carried out in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and the North Caucasus. The working people in these places should gloriously complete this combat task of the Communist Party (applause).

With the consolidation and development of the socialist economy, the increase of labor productivity, and the increase of the income of the working people, our requirements for increasing grain production will continue to grow. The development of grain production, especially the production of high-quality wheat, will enable our country to supply residents with more food, while the development of feed grain production such as corn, barley, and oats can increase the production of meat, oil, and other livestock products (applause). The Party and the government believe that reclaiming virgin land and wasteland and further increasing grain production are great patriotic undertakings of all working people (applause).

The Communist Party has established first-class heavy industry, advanced machine-building industry, and large-scale agricultural production in our country. The current task is to increase the speed of further development of the socialist economy. We should build our country even stronger so that it can prevent any unexpected events from any side (applause). The Soviet people should work together to further improve labor productivity to ensure the gradual transition from socialism to communism.

The Party and the government put forward huge tasks for the Soviet people, requiring each of us not only to work selflessly, but also to fight resolutely against shortcomings. Individual enterprises in our timber and paper industry, coal mining industry, and building materials industry have not completed the tasks given by the state. This cannot be tolerated anymore. Our enterprises have all the necessary conditions to successfully complete the production plan – new and more perfect equipment, skilled workers, engineers, and technical personnel. The current task is to make full use of existing equipment, organize labor correctly, and strive for every worker to complete the production quota. We must better organize socialist competition to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, and reduce costs, and resolutely oppose the phenomenon of shock work that disrupts the balanced work of enterprises. Individual enterprises spend a lot of time compiling various statistical tables and collecting materials on socialist competition, but they do not flexibly and specifically help workers to complete and overfulfill production tasks. These enterprises often like to talk about how many people participated in the competition, but they do not say much about how the entire workers completed the production tasks. It can be seen from the statistical materials that the result of this competition is that all the workers participated in the competition, but in fact the production plan was not completed.

Workers should unremittingly strive to overfulfill production quotas, promote the advanced experience of production innovators in enterprises, improve labor productivity, increase the production of high-quality products according to the types stipulated in the plan, reduce costs, and implement economic accounting to resolutely eliminate the above shortcomings. Our specific task is to eliminate the existing shortcomings in socialist competition, guide the ever-increasing creativity, initiative, and enthusiasm of the masses, explore the internal potential of industry, agriculture, and transportation, and raise all backward enterprises, machine tractor stations, and state farms to the advanced level (applause).

Due to the development of industry and agriculture, the material welfare of the working people has improved. In the past year, the level of real wages has greatly increased, and the income of farmers has increased. After the Party and the government reduced prices six times, the retail prices of bread, macaroni products, and cereals in 1953 were about two-thirds lower than in 1947, the retail prices of potatoes and vegetables were more than two-thirds lower, sugar was reduced by more than half, and meat products and animal oil were reduced by about two-thirds. Therefore, the residents' demand for rye bread and potatoes has decreased, and the demand for better and more nutritious products has increased. The demand for meat, meat products, sugar, fruits, cabbage, melons, textiles, clothing, furniture, and sanitary products has increased particularly. All of the above proves the improvement of the material welfare of the working people.

We have achieved great achievements not only in economic construction, but also in cultural construction. Large-scale housing construction is now underway, and schools, hospitals, sanatoriums, theaters, cinemas, libraries, and clubs are constantly increasing. Last year, various state-owned enterprises, institutions, local soviets, and residents of cities and workers' residential areas, with the help of state loans, built houses with a construction area of ​​28 million square meters. The total investment in building schools, hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, rest homes, Young Pioneer camps, kindergartens, nurseries, and other cultural and welfare institutions increased by 22 percent. The scale of housing construction, social construction, cultural and living welfare construction in the next few years will be further expanded.

The Communist Party and the government tirelessly care about the further prosperity of socialist culture, the development of advanced Soviet science, and the development of technology. Our Party attaches importance to science and advanced figures in the scientific community, because without science we cannot move forward. We quickly adopt every progressive discovery or invention in science in our practical work and promote them to all sectors of the national economy. In order to develop Soviet science and technology, we have created all the conditions, which are impossible in capitalist countries, because Soviet science is carrying out the tasks of communist construction and serving the interests of the people.

The Communist Party follows the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and guides our country with full confidence towards the complete victory of communism (applause).

The socialist mode of production unites the various social strata of Soviet society and combines them into a whole. With the victory of socialism, the face of our country has completely changed. The spiritual and political unity of the Soviet people has developed and strengthened. The friendly cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups in the great Soviet Union has become the law of life of Soviet society.

The socialist system contains inexhaustible potential, which can be fully used to rapidly develop all sectors of the national economy and further strengthen the strength of the Soviet state, which is the bulwark of peace and the security of all people.

Since the last election, the international prestige of the Soviet Union has increased immeasurably.

The purpose of our foreign policy is to further develop the socialist economy and strengthen relations with all countries, regardless of their domestic political system. The Soviet government has consistently implemented a peaceful foreign policy determined by the nature of a socialist country. The Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference is a concrete example of the Soviet Union's consistent implementation of a peaceful and friendly policy. The European security issue, the issue of uniting Germany into a democratic, independent, and unified country, and the issue of restoring an independent and democratic Austria, which were directly and clearly and sincerely and openly raised by the Soviet delegation, attracted the attention of public opinion in various countries. The Berlin Conference helped to more accurately understand the positions of the countries attending the meeting. In the process of exchanging opinions, the fundamental differences between the positions of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet government were clearly manifested, so the way to ease international tensions became more obvious. Under the pressure of the increasingly high movement of working people striving to consolidate world peace, the governments of the United States, France, and Britain reached the following agreement with the Soviet Union: to promote the smooth resolution of the disarmament issue, or at least the issue of substantially reducing armaments; to convene a Geneva conference with the participation of representatives of the United States, France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China (applause), as well as representatives of countries directly related to the settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The peaceful and friendly policy implemented by the Soviet government and the policy of strengthening the increasingly strong peace, democracy, and socialism camp have been warmly supported by progressive mankind, because this policy conforms to the sincere wishes of all ordinary people in the world. Only short-sighted people will regard our foreign policy as a manifestation of Soviet weakness. The test of the Great Patriotic War told the world that our motherland is an indestructible and powerful force that can defend itself and inflict a fatal blow on any aggressor (applause).

Now, the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia are fighting for the consolidation of peace together with the Soviet Union. The peace camp has become an invincible force that can defend peace, socialism, and democracy, and save mankind from the threat of war (applause).

The Soviet Union will continue to adhere to a policy of peace and friendship among all people, which is in the interests of all working people (applause).

In order to welcome the upcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, male and female workers, engineers and technicians, male and female collective farmers, scientists, and intellectuals are fully determined to realize all the tasks stipulated by the Communist Party and the Soviet government (applause). There is no doubt that this election will once again vividly prove that the Soviet people, closely united around their beloved Communist Party, are united in spirit and politics (applause).

Comrades! I express my deep gratitude to you and all the voters of Sverdlovsk who nominated me as a candidate for deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (stormy applause). I will strive not to disappoint the voters' trust in me and will do my best to fight for the realization of the Communist Party's tasks (stormy applause). I believe that on the election day of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, you will unanimously vote for candidates of the Communist Party and non-Party people alliance who can selflessly fight for the prosperity of our motherland (applause).

Long live the great Soviet people – the builders of communism! (applause)

Long live the Communist Party – our wise leader and organizer of all victories! (applause)

Long live the Soviet government! (Stormy applause, turning into cheers. Everyone stands up.)

    在斯维德洛夫斯克城的选民大会上
    尼·米·什维尔尼克同志的讲话
    同志们！苏联人民以坚定的信心来迎接苏联最高苏维埃选举日，他们坚定地相信：自己亲爱的共产党的加强牢不可破的工农联盟、进一步发展生产力以保证提高人民物质和文化水平的政策是正确的。共产党员和非党人民在选举日将再一次显示，他们是一致团结在密切和人民联系并把全部力量用于继续进行经济建设和文化建设的共产党的周围。
    苏联全体人民之所以一致地支持共产党和苏联政府，是因为在我们社会主义国家中掌握政权的是工人和农民，是从事劳动和科学的人，是保卫着劳动人民切身利益的各阶层人民的代表。
    自从上届苏联最高苏维埃选举以来，到现在已有四年了。在这四年中，苏联人民在共产党的领导下，在进一步发展工农业、科学技术和国民经济各部门方面都取得了很大的成就。苏联人民提前完成了战后的五年计划，他们毫不吝惜自己的精力和劳动，忘我地为实现共产主义建设的宏伟计划而奋斗。
    第十九次党代表大会在关于第五个五年计划的指示中确定了苏联的发展道路。去年，工农业有了进一步的发展，国民收入增加了，人民的物质和文化水平提高了。工业生产总额增加为战前一九四○年的二点五倍。政府和党一方面全力发展整个社会主义经济，一方面注意到今后仍要优先发展重工业，因为重工业过去是、现在仍然是整个国民经济繁荣的基础。去年，重工业在增加钢产量方面，在开采煤和石油方面，在电力方面都取得了巨大的成就。制造最先进的、现代化的机器、车床和设备的苏联机器制造业在迅速地壮大和发展着。机器制造业各企业制造的机器和设备约增加为战前一九四○年的四倍。
    党和政府在发展作为社会主义经济基础的基础——重工业的同时，并没有忘记生产日用品的工业部门。共产党正在迅速地发展轻工业，以便在今后两三年内大量增加对居民的工业品和食品的供应。一九五三年，轻工业发展的速度比较快，它出产的产品比一九五二年多百分之十二。丝织品、毛织品和亚麻织品、针织内衣、袜类、植物油、人造牛油、通心粉和其他日用品的生产量都超过计划。但这还不够。我们有一切条件来发展日用品的生产，使它充分满足居民不断增长的需求。
    党和政府不仅使轻工业努力增加商品的数量，而且要改进商品的质量。轻工业应该出产结实、美观、质量高的商品。日用品工业和食品工业各企业的工人、工程技术人员和职员，应该响应党的这一号召，进一步扩大争取提前完成每个企业的生产计划的社会主义竞赛。
    我国的集体农庄和国营农场也获得了很大的成就。战后时期，播种面积和主要农作物的单位面积产量都超过了战前的水平。现在装备农业的拖拉机、联合机、机器和农具比战前是更多、更好了。这些成就是无可争辩的，但我国的要求不止于此。机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄现有的发展水平，还不能满足居民和轻工业对食品和原料的日益增长的需要。党和政府拟定了迅速提高农业的计划。这一计划体现在九月全体会议的决议中，以及党和政府后来在农业方面所作出的一些决议中。我们的迫切任务是：全力发展整个农业生产的基础——谷物，迅速提高饲畜业，保证在两三年内使马铃薯和蔬菜的生产不仅可以充分满足城市居民、工业中心和加工工业的需要，而且可以满足饲畜业的需要。
    党和政府为了完成这一任务，供给了农业以熟练的干部和一切物质技术基础。去年，机器拖拉机站和国营农场得到了十三万九千台通用拖拉机（以十五匹马力计算）、一万八千台中耕用拖拉机、四万一千台谷物收割联合机、六万九千辆载重汽车、二百多万件农具和机器。党和政府十分注意加强机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄。机器拖拉机站现在约有一百二十五万名拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队队长和副队长及复杂的农业机器操使者。现在已从工业部门和国民经济其他部门中抽调了大批具有丰富的知识和工作经验的、熟练的工程师、技术人员、农艺师、牲畜饲养师下乡。
    农业工作者为实现党中央九月全体会议的决议所作的坚忍不拔的努力，对农业水平的提高发生了良好的影响。一九五三年秋天，各集体农庄和国营农场比前年多耕了一千三百万公顷秋耕地和三百五十万公顷秋耕休闲地。牲畜头数以及征购和收购的肉类、牛奶、羊毛和其他农产品都大大地增加了。
    党中央委员会二月全体会议制定了一项非常重要的全国性的任务：一九五四年到一九五五年至少开垦荒废土地和处女地一千三百万公顷，以扩大谷物播种面积，到一九五五年要在这些土地上收获十一亿到十二亿普特的谷物，其中要有八亿到九亿普特商品谷物。开垦荒废土地和处女地的工作，主要是在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域、北高加索等地进行，这些地方的劳动人民应当光荣地完成共产党的这个战斗任务（鼓掌）。
    随着社会主义经济的巩固和发展、劳动生产率的提高以及劳动人民收入的增加，我们对增加谷物的生产的要求也将不断增长。谷物生产的发展，特别是优等小麦生产的发展，将使我国有可能供给居民更多的粮食，而玉蜀黍、大麦、燕麦等饲料谷物生产的发展，就可以提高肉类、油类和其他畜产品的生产（鼓掌）。党和政府认为，开垦处女地和荒废土地以及进一步增加谷物生产，是所有劳动人民爱国的伟大事业（鼓掌）。
    共产党在我国建立了头等的重工业，先进的机器制造业和大规模的农业生产。目前的任务是，提高进一步发展社会主义经济的速度。我们应当把我们的国家建设得更加强大，使它能够防止来自任何方面的任何意外事件（鼓掌）。苏联人应当同心同德努力进一步提高劳动生产率，以保证由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义。
    党和政府对苏联人民提出巨大的任务，要求我们每一个人不仅要忘我地劳动，而且要和缺点进行坚决的斗争。我们的木材和造纸工业、采煤工业和建筑材料工业中还有个别企业没有完成国家给予的任务。这不能再容忍了。我们的企业有着一切胜利完成生产计划的必需条件——新的、更完善的设备、熟练的工人、工程师、技术人员干部。目前的任务是，充分利用现有的设备，正确组织劳动，争取每一个工人都能完成生产定额。我们必须为提高劳动生产率，改进产品质量，降低成本而更好地组织社会主义竞赛，坚决反对破坏企业均衡工作的突击现象。有个别企业花很多时间去编制各种统计表，搜集关于社会主义竞赛的材料，但却没有灵活地、具体地去帮助工人完成和超额完成生产任务。这些企业往往喜欢讲有多少人参加了竞赛，可是不大说全体工人完成生产任务的情形如何。从统计材料就可以看出，这种竞赛的结果是，全部工人都参加了竞赛，但是实际上却没有完成生产计划。
    工人应坚持不懈地力求超额完成生产定额，在企业中推广生产革新者的先进经验，提高劳动生产率，按照计划规定的种类增加优等质量的产品的生产，减低成本，实行经济核算，以坚决消灭上述缺点。我们的具体任务是：消灭社会主义竞赛中现有的缺点，引导群众不断增长的创造性、主动性和积极性，发掘工业、农业和运输业中的内部潜力，把所有落后的企业、机器拖拉机站、国营农场提高到先进的水平（鼓掌）。
    由于工业和农业的发展，劳动人民的物质福利提高了。过去一年中，实际工资的水平大大提高了，农民的收入增加了。党和政府六次减低物价后，一九五三年的面包、通心粉制品、麦片的零售价格约比一九四七年减低了三分之二，马铃薯和蔬菜的零售价格减低了三分之二强，糖减低一半以上，肉制品和动物油减低了约三分之二。因此，居民对裸麦面包和马铃薯的需求减少了，对更好更富于营养的产品的需求增加了。对肉类、肉制品、糖、水果、甘蓝、瓜类的需求特别增加了，对纺织品、成衣、家具、卫生用品的需求增加了。上述一切都证明了劳动人民的物质福利的提高。
    不仅在经济建设方面，而且在文化建设方面我们也获得了巨大的成就。现在正进行着大规模的住宅建设，不断增加学校、医院、休养地、剧院、电影院、图书馆和俱乐部。去年，各国营企业、机关、地方苏维埃，以及城市和工人住宅区的居民，在国家贷款的帮助下共建造了建筑面积达二千八百万平方公尺的住宅。在建造学校、医院、诊疗所、疗养院、休养所、少年先锋营、幼儿园、托儿所以及其他文化福利机关方面的投资总额增加了百分之二十二。今后几年的住宅建设、社会建设、文化和生活福利建设的规模还要进一步扩大。
    共产党和政府不倦地关心着社会主义文化进一步的繁荣，关心先进的苏联科学的发展和技术的发展。我们党重视科学和科学界的先进人物，因为没有科学我们就不能够前进。我们在实际工作中迅速采用科学中每一件进步的发现或发明，并把它们推广到国民经济各部门去。为了发展苏联的科学和技术，我们创造了一切条件，这些条件在资本主义国家中是不可能有的，因为苏联的科学是执行共产主义建设的任务，为人民的利益服务的。
    共产党遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，满怀信心地引导我国走向共产主义的完全胜利。（掌声）
    社会主义的生产方式团结了苏维埃社会的各个社会阶层，并使它们结合成一个整体。随着社会主义的胜利，我国的面貌已经完全改观。苏联人民精神上和政治上的团结一致发展和加强了。伟大苏联的各族人民的友好合作已成为苏维埃社会的生活法则。
    在社会主义制度中蕴藏着取之不尽的潜力，这完全可能用来迅速发展国民经济各部门，进一步加强作为和平与各国人民安全的堡垒的苏维埃国家的力量。
    自从上届选举以来，苏联的国际威望不可估计地提高了。
    我们的外交政策的目的是为了进一步发展社会主义经济，加强与各国的关系，不管它们的国内政治制度如何。苏联政府始终如一地执行着社会主义国家性质所决定的和平外交政策。柏林外长会议就是苏联一贯执行和平友好政策的具体例证。苏联代表团直接明确地、诚恳公开地提出的欧洲安全问题，把德国统一成一个民主独立统一的国家的问题，恢复独立民主的奥地利的问题，引起各国舆论的注意。柏林会议有助于比较正确地了解出席会议国家的立场，在交换意见的过程中明显地表现出美国、英国、法国和苏联政府立场之间的基本分歧，因而缓和国际紧张局势的途径就更为明显了。在劳动人民争取巩固世界和平的日益高涨的运动的压力下，美国、法国和英国三国政府与苏联达成了如下的协议：促进顺利解决裁军问题，或至少是大量缩减军备问题；召开有美国、法国、英国、苏联和中华人民共和国的代表（鼓掌），以及与解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平直接有关的国家的代表参加的日内瓦会议。
    苏联政府执行的和平友好政策和加强日益壮大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的政策，受到进步人类的热烈拥护，因为这种政策符合世界各国所有普通人民的真诚愿望。只有近视的人才会把我们的外交政策看作是苏联软弱的表现，伟大的卫国战争的考验告诉全世界：我们的祖国是一支不可摧毁的强大力量，它能够自卫，能够对任何侵略者给予致命的打击（鼓掌）。
    现在，欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家和苏联一起为巩固和平而奋斗。和平阵营已成为一个不可战胜的力量，它能够捍卫和平、社会主义与民主，拯救人类摆脱战争的威胁（鼓掌）。
    苏联今后仍将坚持符合全体劳动人民利益的、各国人民和平友好的政策（鼓掌）。
    为了迎接即将举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举，男女工人、工程师和技术人员，男女集体农民、科学家和知识分子以充分的决心来实现共产党和苏联政府所规定的一切任务（鼓掌）。无容置疑，这次选举将再一次生动地证明：紧密团结在自己亲爱的共产党周围的苏联人民在精神上和政治上是团结一致的（鼓掌）。
    同志们！我对你们和提名我为苏联最高苏维埃代表候选人的斯维德洛夫斯克全体选民表示深切的谢意（暴风雨般的鼓掌）。我将努力不辜负选民对我的信任，将竭尽全力为实现共产党的任务而奋斗（暴风雨般的鼓掌声）。我相信，在苏联最高苏维埃选举日，你们将一致投票选举能够为我们祖国的繁荣而忘我斗争的共产党和非党人民联盟的候选人（鼓掌）。
    伟大的苏联人民——共产主义的建设者万岁！（鼓掌）
    共产党——我们英明的领袖和一切胜利的组织者万岁！（鼓掌）
    苏联政府万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声，转为欢呼声。全体起立。）
