    Before and After the Transformation of the Donglu Township Government
    Liu Yi, Wang Xiuqing, Qin Hongyan
    Donglu Township in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, was long in a backward state because some village governments were controlled by bad elements, and some village cadres were passive and sluggish. Last September, the township held a general election. The Party and the People's Government seriously and correctly dealt with the illegal and undisciplined bad cadres. After the people elected upright and fair-minded activists into the government, the whole township's face was completely renewed, transforming from lifeless to vibrant.
    Donglu Township was formed last year by combining the three administrative villages of Donglu, Xilu, and Hancun. Although these villages were liberated as early as 1948 and land reform was completed in 1949, the Party's foundation was very weak. Only Hancun developed five Party members in two batches after the land reform. Due to the lack of caution in building the Party, bad elements infiltrated it, and the lack of regular education for Party members, some Party members violated laws and discipline, and some degenerated, undermining the Party's prestige among the people. Zhang Fangzhen, the former Party branch secretary of Hancun, served as the village deputy during the Japanese puppet regime and also participated in the Kuomintang bandit's plainclothes team. He pretended to be active during the land reform, seized the opportunity to join the Party, and served as the chairman of the farmers' association. He colluded with the bad element and deputy village chief Jing Fucai, using his power to act tyrannically, extort and blackmail, embezzle grain funds, rape women, and frame good people, becoming a "local emperor" and "local tyrant." Even during the land reform, they did not act in accordance with the Party's policies and wrongly struggled against seven middle-peasant households. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, Zhang Fangzhen and others took the opportunity to retaliate, struggling against and hanging nine innocent farmers.
    The Party organizations in Donglu and Xilu villages were never established. Some activists who emerged during the land reform were not given assistance from the county and district cadres or regular education from the Party. Their political awareness was not high, and they were afraid of attending cadre meetings, which would delay their production. They were not active in their work. For example, Shen Zhanyuan, the village chief of Xilu Village, used to be very active in his work, but he lacked working methods and was blunt. After encountering setbacks, he became discouraged and felt that being a cadre not only delayed production but also made the masses complain. Later, he just buried himself in production and rarely interfered with work. Once these people abandoned leadership, the village government fell into the hands of reactionary forces. Guo Jishan, the director of Donglu Village, served as the village chief during the rule of the Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan's bandits. After liberation, he infiltrated the people's government, superficially obeyed orders from above but passively coped with them, making it difficult to carry out various tasks.
    The ability of bad elements to control the village government was inseparable from the simple and all-encompassing leadership methods of the higher authorities. During the democratic construction of the government in 1950, the county and district cadres working in the township were blinded by the false activeness of the bad elements. They did not delve into the masses to listen to their opinions, and thus, contrary to the will of the masses, used all-encompassing methods to allow that group of bad elements to continue to be elected. At that time, the masses were very dissatisfied, saying, "They (referring to the work team) already have their own people in mind, and they can't do without that bunch!" This is the main reason why the village governments in these villages were able to be controlled by bad elements for a long time.
    Due to the impurity of the grassroots government and the passive and sluggishness of some cadres, various policies and decrees could not reach the masses, and the people's political consciousness could not be raised. Reactionary secret societies took the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities. Last year, Zhang Shengfu, the head of the "True God Jade Path," and others developed more than 150 followers in the township at once. They extorted property, spread rumors to confuse the public, and brought great suffering to the masses. Under such circumstances, the farmers were also unwilling to produce well. Mutual aid and cooperation in the village were silent and invisible. Last spring, the cadres of Xilu Village formed forty-two mutual aid groups in order to cope with the higher authorities, but in reality, they had never worked together. In the few years since liberation, this village had not bought livestock or farm tools, and had rarely used soybean cake and other fertilizers. The land yield was still at the level before liberation.
    Last spring, in the struggle against bureaucratism, commandism, and violations of laws and discipline, Zhang Fangzhen and Jing Fucai were expelled from the Party and arrested and sentenced to imprisonment. In September, Donglu Township began the pilot work of general elections. The work team used the facts of how bad elements manipulated the village government to bring suffering to the people to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, so that the masses deeply felt the importance of the government from their own experience and realized that elections were a major event related to the people's lives. Farmer Li Shengxiu said, "This election cannot be careless, we must elect cadres who can truly work for the people. If we let those bad elements control the power again, the people will suffer!" During the deliberation stage of population investigation and voter registration, people gathered in groups of three or five to discuss who had the right to vote, who did not have the right to vote, and the qualifications and conditions of the representatives. Wang Guilin and other farmers in Xilu Village took advantage of the production breaks to automatically gather together to deliberate on who to elect as representatives. They proposed that Liang Fusheng had a clear class stand, was upright, fair-minded, democratic in his work style, and could connect with the masses, and could be elected as a representative. On the day of the election, people were so happy and excited! Young women who lived in their mothers' homes rushed back, and many households left no one behind, bringing their sons and daughters with them. In order to exercise their democratic rights, people actively participated in the election. Of the 1,967 voters in the township, 1,885 participated in the election, accounting for 95.8% of the total number of voters. During the election, the masses were very meticulous and serious, and the distinction between the enemy and us was very clear. People like Guo Jishan did not receive a single vote. Some cadres with slight shortcomings and mistakes were criticized in good faith. For example, when Shen Zhanyuan was elected, the masses criticized him for his blunt attitude and sluggish work. He accepted everyone's opinions, made a self-criticism, and said that he would correct his mistakes in the future and wholeheartedly serve the people, so he was understood by the people, and as a result, he was elected as a representative again. A total of 39 representatives were elected in the township, and 13 township people's government committee members were produced from the representatives. Among the people's representatives and people's government committee members were Song Guangliang and Wang Runlan, activists who emerged in various movements; and Zhang Shengqi and Guo Baonu, who actively struggled against bad people and bad deeds such as Zhang Fangzhen.
    The newly elected people's representatives and cadres have the quality and style of serving the people loyally and the energetic enthusiasm for work. After being elected as cadres, they actively led the farmers to organize mutual aid and cooperation and develop production. Song Guangliang, the director of Donglu Village, and Gao Shengde, the public security committee member, first grasped the masses' demands for developing production and carried out a comprehensive rectification of the village's mutual aid groups. They went deep into each mutual aid group, discovered problems in a timely manner, and solved them in a timely manner. For example, the Duan Liansheng mutual aid group originally had only three households. They did not record work points, did not keep accounts, and did not implement the principle of equivalent mutual benefit, so their work was intermittent. The village cadres helped them find out the reasons for the past disintegration and implemented a simple and easy-to-use work point recording method, and achieved timely clearing of work and equal work. Now this mutual aid group has expanded to five households and has become a perennial mutual aid group. There used to be a pontoon bridge north of Beihancun Village, which had been in disrepair for many years. Farmers could not pass through when hauling crops, and had to detour through Zhonghancun Village, which was very inconvenient. The masses raised this opinion to village director An Fahong and people's representative Zhang Shengqi. An and Zhang accepted the opinions of the masses and immediately led the farmers to repair the bridge in a few days. The masses reflected that: the present is really different from the past. When Zhang Fangzhen was in power, raising an opinion was in vain. Now, when it is raised, it can be done. The problem that had not been solved for more than 20 years has been solved. This kind of active action by village cadres to serve the people has been supported by the people. Recently, eleven newly grown cadres such as Song Guangliang and Wang Runlan have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China because they can closely connect with the masses and sincerely serve the people.
    The people of Donglu Township, who have truly become the masters, are using their powerful strength to build their new lives. Now, everything in Donglu Township is changing and new, presenting a thriving new atmosphere. This village, which had not bought farm tools, fertilizers, or livestock for several years, bought 8,000 jin of fertilizer, two walking plows, five weeders, and five heads of livestock last fall. Zhongnong Jing Fangyuan bought a cow the day after Zhang Fangzhen and Jing Fucai were arrested. He said, "I have wanted to buy one for a long time, but I didn't dare to buy it." In addition to rectifying the original mutual aid groups, the township has also newly developed four mutual aid groups. Now there are a total of eight perennial mutual aid groups and twelve temporary mutual aid groups in the township, with 122 participating households. Among them, the four perennial mutual aid groups of Yu Dexiu, Zhang Shengqi, and others are actively carrying out rectification and improvement, and are preparing to transform into agricultural production cooperatives after the wheat harvest this year. Women's work has also changed greatly. Women in Donglu Village rarely attended meetings in the past, but now at least 60 or 70 women participate in meetings. After the social status of women has improved, they urgently demand to learn politics and culture, and there are often more than 30 women studying in the folk school. Chai Fuzhen and other seven women in the folk school have also served as township women representatives or residential group leaders.
    After the people of Donglu Township enjoyed a free, democratic, and happy life, their political consciousness was further raised, and they actively responded to every call of the Party and the People's Government. The masses expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party in their trust and support for the new government. In the work of purchasing surplus grain last year, the township completed the purchase plan with an excess of 8%. While purchasing grain, many farmers also joined the supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. Now, the money from selling surplus grain by farmers in Donglu Township, in addition to depositing part of it in credit cooperatives, most of it has been used to buy livestock and farm tools, actively preparing for spring plowing and production.

    东芦乡政权改造前后
    刘仪  王秀清  秦洪彦
    山西省临汾县东芦乡，过去因为有的村政权掌握在坏分子手中，有的村干部消极疲沓，全乡长期处于落后状态。去年九月这乡进行了普选，党和人民政府严肃正确地处理了违法乱纪的坏干部，人民把为人正派、办事公道的积极分子选进政权后，全乡的面貌焕然一新，由死气沉沉变成了朝气勃勃。
    东芦乡是去年划乡时由东芦、西芦和韩村三个行政村组成的。这些村庄，虽然在一九四八年即已解放，一九四九年结束了土地改革，但是党的基础非常薄弱，全乡仅韩村在土地改革后分两批发展了五个党员。由于在建党时不够慎重，让坏分子混进了党内，和对党员缺乏经常教育，所以有的党员违法乱纪，有的蜕化变质，破坏了党在人民群众中的威信。韩村前任党支部书记张方珍，在日伪时期担任村副，又参加过蒋匪帮的便衣队，土地改革中假装积极，乘机混入党内，并担任了农会主席。他勾结坏分子副村长景福财，利用职权横行霸道，敲诈勒索，贪污粮款，强奸妇女，陷害好人，成了“土皇帝”、“土霸王”。还在土地改革时，他们就不按照党的政策办事，错斗了七户中农。一九五一年镇压反革命运动中，张方珍等更乘机挟嫌报复，斗争和吊打了无辜农民九人。
    东芦和西芦两村的党的组织始终没有建立起来。土地改革中涌现出来的一些积极分子，因为得不到县、区干部的帮助和党的经常教育，政治觉悟不高，怕当干部开会误工，耽误自己的生产，不积极工作。比如西芦村村长沈占元，过去工作很积极，但是缺少工作办法，态度生硬，碰了钉子后，便灰心丧气，觉得当干部既耽误生产，又受群众埋怨，后来只是埋头生产，不大过问工作了。这些人一放弃领导，村政权便落在反动势力的手中。东芦村主任郭积善，在日寇和阎匪统治时就担任村长，解放后又钻进人民政权，对上阳奉阴违，消极应付，各种工作很难开展。
    坏分子能够掌握村政权，是和上级的领导方法简单、包办代替分不开的。一九五零年民主建政时，在该乡工作的县、区干部，被坏分子的假积极所蒙蔽，没有深入群众听取群众的意见，因而违反群众意志，用包办代替的方法使那批坏分子继续当选。当时群众很不满意，说：“人家（指工作组）早就有了底子啦，反正离不了那伙人！”这就是这些村的村政权能够长期被坏分子所掌握的主要原因。
    由于基层政权的不纯和某些干部的消极疲沓，各种政策、法令不能和群众见面，人民的政治觉悟得不到提高。反动会道门趁机大肆活动。去年，“真主玉道”头子张生福等一下子便在该乡发展了一百五十多个道徒。他们勒索财物，造谣惑众，给群众带来了很大痛苦。在这种情况下，农民也无心好好生产。村里的互助合作无声无息。去年春天，西芦村的干部为了应付上级，编起四十二个互助组，实际上都没有在一块做过活。解放几年来，这个村没有买过牲口、农具，也很少使用豆饼等肥料，土地产量还停留在解放前的水平上。
    去年春天，在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，张方珍、景福财被开除党籍，并被逮捕起来分别判处了徒刑。九月间，东芦乡开始了普选试办工作。工作组用以往坏分子操纵村政权给人民带来痛苦的事实，进行了广泛深入的宣传教育，使群众从亲身体验中深深感到政权的重要，认识到选举是关系着人民生活的大事。农民李生秀说：“这次选举可不能马马虎虎，一定要选上真正能为人民办事的干部。如果还让那些坏分子掌握刀把子，老百姓就要遭殃！”在人口调查、选民登记等酝酿阶段中，人们三个一群，五个一伙地谈论着谁有选举权，谁没有选举权以及代表的资格和条件。西芦村农民王桂林等利用生产休息的空隙，自动聚在一起酝酿选谁当代表。他们提出梁福生阶级立场明确，为人正派，办事公道，作风民主，能联系群众，可以当选为代表。到了选举的那天，人们是那么欢欣鼓舞！住娘家的青年妇女赶了回来，好多户都是全家不留一人，携男抱女的全去了。人们为了行使自己的民主权利，积极参加了选举，全乡一千九百六十七个选民，参加选举的有一千八百八十五人，占选民总数的百分之九十五点八。选举中群众非常细致认真，敌我界限划得很清。像郭积善等这样的人，没有一个人投他们的票。对一些稍有缺点和错误的干部，则善意地进行了批评。比如在选举沈占元时，群众批评他态度生硬，工作疲沓，他接受了大家的意见，进行了检讨，表示今后要改正错误，全心全意为人民办事，因而得到了人民的谅解，结果又当选了代表。全乡共选出三十九个代表，代表中产生了十三个乡人民政府委员。人民代表和人民政府委员中，有在各种运动中涌现出来的积极分子宋光亮、王润兰；有和张方珍等坏人坏事积极进行斗争的张盛棋、郭保女。
    新选出来的人民代表和干部，有忠诚为人民服务的品质和作风，有朝气勃勃的工作热情。他们当选了干部后，就积极领导农民组织互助合作，发展生产。东芦村主任宋光亮、治安保卫委员高胜德等，首先抓住群众发展生产的要求，对村里的互助组进行了全面的整顿。他们深入各个互助组内，及时发现问题，及时解决。比如段连生互助组原来只有三户，他们不记工，不算账，没有实行等价互利政策，所以工作时起时落。村干部便帮助他们找出过去涣散垮台的原因，实行了简便易行的记工办法，并做到了及时清工齐工。现在这个互助组已经扩大为五户，转成了常年互助组。北韩村村北原来有一座浮桥，多年失修，农民拉庄稼不能通过，要绕中韩村，很不便利。群众把这个意见提给村主任安发鸿和人民代表张盛棋，安、张二人接受了群众的意见，立即领导农民在几天内修好了这座桥。群众反映说：现在和过去真不一样了，张方珍掌权时，提了意见白搭，现在提出来就能办到，二十多年来没有解决的问题解决了。村干部的这种积极为人民群众服务的行动，受到人民群众的拥护。最近宋光亮、王润兰等十一个新成长起来的干部，由于能密切地联系群众，真诚地为人民办事，而光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    东芦乡的人民真正做了主人，就以强大的力量来建设自己的新生活。现在，东芦乡无处不变，无处不新，呈现着欣欣向荣的新气象。这个村几年来没有买过农具、肥料和添置牲口，去年秋季就买了八千斤肥料、两张步犁、五张耘锄和五头牲口。中农景方元在张方珍、景福财被捕的第二天就买了一头牛，他说：“早有心买，就是不敢买。”全乡除整顿了原有的互助组外，并新发展了四个互助组。现在全乡共有八个常年互助组和十二个临时互助组，参加的农户达到一百二十二户。其中于德秀、张生棋等四个常年互助组，积极进行整顿提高，准备今年麦收后转为农业生产合作社。妇女工作也大大变了样。东芦村的妇女过去很少参加会议，现在开会时至少也有六、七十个妇女参加。妇女们的社会地位提高后，便迫切地要求学习政治和文化，民校里经常有三十多个妇女在那里学习。民校学员柴福珍等七个妇女，并担任了乡妇女代表或居民小组长。
    东芦乡的人民享受到自由、民主、幸福的生活后，政治觉悟更加提高，积极地响应党和人民政府的每一个号召。群众把对毛主席、共产党的感激心情表达在对新政权的信任和支持上，在去年收购余粮的工作中，全乡超额百分之八完成了收购计划。在购粮工作的同时，好多农民并加入了供销合作社和信用合作社。现在，东芦乡的农民卖余粮的钱除一部分存入信用合作社外，大部分都买了牲口和农具，积极准备春耕生产。
