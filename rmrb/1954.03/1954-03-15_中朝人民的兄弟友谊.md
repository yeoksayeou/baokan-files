Comrade

A Fighter
It was early morning on a certain day in April 1953. Kim Hoi-jeol, a reconnaissance soldier of the Korean People's Army, and his two companions were on their way back after completing a mission when they were suddenly attacked by the enemy. His two companions unfortunately sacrificed their lives, and he himself was wounded. The enemy used artillery fire to block his return route and sent a platoon of men to pursue him closely. Kim Hoi-jeol was very clear: the materials he had reconnoitered were the guarantee of victory for their troops in attacking a certain enemy high ground. He was determined to send the reconnaissance materials back to his own position no matter what. However, he was now surrounded by the enemy, and his wounds were increasing, and he was bleeding more and more. At this critical moment, a volunteer soldier bypassed the enemy's firepower and ran towards him. He was Zhang Dehua, a health worker from a volunteer army unit.

Zhang Dehua saw the wounded soldier being chased by the enemy from the volunteer army's position and ran over to rescue him. As soon as he saw that he was a soldier of the Korean People's Army, he immediately hugged him and took him to a ditch, and then prepared to stop the enemies that were chasing after them. Just as he picked up his gun and was about to stand up, Kim Hoi-jeol anxiously grabbed his clothes and said to him, "Comrade, please give this to our troops nearby..." As he spoke, he took out a reconnaissance sketch map and several documents stained with blood from his pocket. However, Zhang Dehua thought: how can this Korean People’s Army soldier be saved if the enemy is not eliminated first! So, he waved his hand at Kim Hoi-jeol, indicating that he should wait before handling the reconnaissance materials, and then raised his gun and fired fiercely at the enemy. At this time, Kim Hoi-jeol also struggled and threw out several grenades. The enemy was driven back; however, there was still mortar fire attacking them. Zhang Dehua was also wounded at this time, but he struggled to carry his comrade on his back, passed through the enemy's artillery blockade, and walked towards his position. A unit of the Volunteer Army quickly came to meet them and rescued them. In this way, Kim Hoi-jeol finally brought back the reconnaissance materials he exchanged with the blood of himself and his volunteer army comrades to his unit. (Song Yi, Korea)

  Martyr Fang Yuangen
On the afternoon of June 29, 1953, the sun had just set, and the sound of our army's intensive counter-attack artillery fire was still constantly coming from "Square Mountain." The stretcher team organized by the farmers in Dajingli carried wounded Volunteer Army soldiers down from the front line through the enemy's heavy blockade. At about six o'clock, just as they reached Dongpodong, twenty-six American planes suddenly appeared in the sky. These aerial bandits swooped down frantically and dropped more than fifty bombs. The stretcher carried by Fang Yuangen could not avoid it in time. Fang Yuangen was a member of the Democratic Youth League. When he heard the screams of the bombs, he thought: the wounded Volunteer Army comrades must not be injured again! So, he did not hesitate to pounce on the wounded soldier and shield him with his own body. At this moment, a bomb landed beside him, and he suffered serious injuries to his chest and ribs.

The stretcher bearers immediately helped him off the wounded soldier. He woke up from his coma, and as soon as he opened his eyes, he said to his companions: "Don't worry about me, quickly hide the wounded comrades!" At this time, Fang Yuangen's father, Fang Xingfu, was carrying a stretcher from behind to the front line. Suddenly, he saw his son seriously injured, and tears were in his eyes. He gritted his teeth and said: "Yuangen! You did the right thing! I'll carry the wounded soldiers for you!" The stretcher bearers all persuaded Fang Xingfu to carry Yuangen back first; however, the old man shook his head, immediately took over from his son, picked up the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers, and walked back.

Before dawn on June 30, Fang Yuangen gloriously sacrificed his life due to his serious injuries. The Volunteer Army buried Martyr Fang Yuangen alongside the Volunteer Army martyrs, just as they would bury their own martyrs. (Chang Zheng, Shen Shanqi)

  Girl Yingzi
Yingzi is the daughter of Cui, an old woman who is a labor party member of Changdao Village in Korea. Her three older brothers all joined the Korean People's Army. This seventeen-year-old girl worked with her mother at home to support the war.

It was the autumn harvest season of September 1952. One day, the mother and daughter were harvesting in the field, talking and laughing, when suddenly eight enemy planes broke into the sky above this peaceful field. A burst of bombs was dropped, and Yingzi's leg was injured. At this critical moment, Volunteer Army soldiers ignored the enemy's bombing and immediately rescued Yingzi to their hospital. After a month of treatment, Yingzi's injury healed. From then on, the mother and daughter loved the Volunteer Army even more. Whenever they saw Volunteer Army troops passing by, they would either boil water for them or cook for them, treating them with great care.

Last July, when our army counter-attacked the enemy's position on Jiaoyan Mountain, Yingzi voluntarily joined the nursing team to support the front line. As soon as she arrived at the hospital, Yingzi was busy wiping the faces of the wounded soldiers who had just come down from the battlefield, fetching water, drying quilts, and changing clothes. After settling the wounded soldiers, she immediately went to the river to wash the bloody clothes. She also often sang and danced for the wounded soldiers, never letting the wounded soldiers feel lonely for a moment. The wounded soldier Fu Zemin said to others: "This little girl is even better than my own sister. Seeing her, my wound doesn't hurt anymore!" The wounded soldiers were all grateful to Yingzi and gave her their notebooks, soaps, towels, and other things as souvenirs.

One day, just as Yingzi was fetching water for the wounded soldiers, enemy planes came again. A burst of crazy bombing killed more than a dozen Korean villagers near the hospital. Yingzi, the best friend of the wounded soldiers, also left them forever...

After the news of Yingzi's sacrifice reached Cui's house, Cui endured the pain and calmly said to the wounded Volunteer Army comrades: "She is worthy of being my daughter. She died gloriously! Comrades, don't worry about me. Don't think I'm old, I will definitely fight to the end for the liberation of the motherland!"

    中朝人民的兄弟友谊
    战友
    一九五三年四月某天的清早。朝鲜人民军侦察兵金会杰和他的两个同伴完成任务后正往回走，突然遭到了敌人的袭击，两位同伴不幸牺牲了，自己也负了伤。敌人用炮弹封锁了他的归路，并派出一排人紧紧地追赶他。金会杰非常清楚：他身上侦察得来的材料，是他们部队袭击某高地敌人的胜利保证，他下定决心，无论如何也要把侦察材料送回自己的阵地。可是，现在敌人包围了他，他身上的伤口还在增加，血也流得越来越多了。正在危急之际，一个志愿军战士绕过敌人的火力，向他跑来了，他是志愿军某部卫生员张德华。
    张德华是从志愿军阵地上看到这位伤员被敌人追赶，跑过来救护的。他一看是一位朝鲜人民军的战士，马上就把他抱到山沟里，又准备去拦住后面追赶上来的敌人。当他正拿起枪要站起来时，金会杰很着急地扯着他的衣服对他说：“同志，请你把这东西交给附近我们部队。……”一面说，一面从口袋里掏出被血染红了的一张侦察略图和几份文件。可是，张德华想：如果不先把敌人消灭，怎么能救下这个人民军的伤员呢！于是，他一面向金会杰摆手，表示且慢处理侦察材料，一面举起枪猛烈地向敌人扫射；这时，金会杰也挣扎着又扔出几个手榴弹。敌人被打退了；但是，还有迫击炮火向他们袭来。张德华这时也负了伤，不过他还挣扎着背起自己的战友，穿过敌人的炮火封锁，向自己的阵地走去，志愿军某部很快接应上来，把他们救了回去。这样，金会杰终于把用自己和志愿军战友的鲜血换来的侦察材料带回了自己的部队。（朝鲜　宋镒）
      方元根烈士
    一九五三年六月二十九日下午，太阳刚刚落山，从“方形山”还不断传来我军紧密的反击炮声，大井里农民组织的担架队，抬着志愿军伤员，冲过敌人的重重封锁线，从火线上下来了。六点钟左右，当他们刚走到东坡洞时，天空忽然出现了二十六架美国飞机，这些空中强盗疯狂地俯冲下来，丢下五十多颗炸弹。担架队员方元根抬的那付担架，已经来不及躲避了。方元根是个民主青年同盟的盟员，当他听到了炸弹的尖叫声时，他想：绝不能让志愿军伤员同志再负一次伤，于是，他毫不犹豫地扑到伤员身上，用自己的身子掩护着他。这时一颗炸弹落到他的身旁，他胸部和肋下负了重伤。
    担架队员们立刻把他从伤员身上扶下来，他从昏迷中清醒过来，刚睁开眼睛，就对他的同伴们说：“不要管我，快把伤员同志隐蔽起来！”这时，方元根的爸爸方兴福从后面抬着担架正往前沿去，忽然看到自己的儿子负了重伤，眼泪直在眼眶里转，他咬了咬牙说：“元根！你做得对！我来替你抬伤员！”担架队员们都劝方兴福先把元根抬回去；可是，这老人却摇了摇头，马上接替了自己的儿子，把志愿军伤员抬起就往回走了。
    六月三十日黎明前，方元根终因伤势过重光荣地牺牲了。志愿军像安葬自己的烈士一样，将方元根烈士和志愿军烈士葬在一起。（长正、沈善齐）
    英子姑娘
    英子，是朝鲜昌道里劳动党员崔老大娘的女儿。她三个哥哥都参加了朝鲜人民军。这位十七岁的姑娘和母亲一起在家劳动，支援战争。
    一九五二年九月的秋收时节。一天，母女俩正在地里收割，有说有笑，突然，八架敌机闯到这片和平田野的上空，一阵炸弹扔下来，英子的腿被炸伤了。正在危急的时候，志愿军战士们不顾敌机的轰炸，立刻把英子抢救到自己的医院里去。经过一个月的治疗，英子的伤好了。从此以后，母女俩更加热爱志愿军，每见过路的志愿军部队，不是给烧水，就是给做饭，亲切地招待他们。
    去年七月，我军反击轿岩山敌人阵地时，英子自动参加了支援前线的护理队。一到医院，英子就忙着给刚从战场上下来的伤员们擦脸、打水、晒被子、换衣服，他把伤员安置好以后，又马上到河里去洗血衣了。她还常常给伤员唱歌跳舞，一会也不让伤员感到寂寞。伤员傅泽民对人说：“这位小姑娘比我的亲妹妹还好，看到她我的伤口就不疼啦！”伤员们都感激英子，纷纷把自己的笔记本、香皂、毛巾等东西送给她作纪念品。
    一天，正当英子给伤员打水时，敌机又来了，一阵狂炸，医院附近的十几位朝鲜老乡被炸死了，伤员们最好的朋友——英子也永远离开了他们……
    英子牺牲的消息传到崔老大娘家中之后，崔老大娘忍住悲痛，镇静地对志愿军伤员同志们说：“她不愧是我的女儿，她死得光荣！同志们不用惦记我，别看我年纪大，我一定为祖国的解放斗争到底！”
