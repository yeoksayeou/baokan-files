    The Stalin Collective Farm in the Soviet Union
    Near Moscow, in the Soviet Union, lies the Stalin Collective Farm.
    This collective farm was established after the merger of eight collective farms, encompassing 23,000 hectares of land. As a result of reclaiming wasteland, the sown area has now been expanded to 26,000 hectares. Grain crops occupy a major position in the collective farm’s production. In addition, castor beans, sunflowers, vegetables, fruits, and other industrial crops are planted; sericulture and animal husbandry are also well developed.
    The various departments of the farm are guided by various experts, such as agronomists, mechanical engineers, construction engineers, highly educated breeders, economic planners, and other specialists. They are all members of the collective farm, and some of them have been elected as members of the farm management committee.
    In order to achieve higher yields, various experiments on grains, industrial crops, agronomy, and new fertilization methods are conducted on a 150-hectare experimental field under the guidance of agronomists, and the results of the experiments are applied to production. In addition, deep plowing is used. On the basis of increased production, the collective farm's grain harvest in 1953 doubled compared to 1950. The number of cattle increased from 1,541 to 2,500, pigs from 900 to 2,500, horses from 395 to 560, and the number of sheep and poultry also increased significantly. In 1952, the collective farm earned 3,071,000 rubles from animal husbandry; in 1953, they exceeded the level of livestock development stipulated in the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU by two to two and a half times.
    When distributing income, each member received more than six rubles and three and a half kilograms of grain per work day, in addition to vegetables and other products. Many families received several tons of grain, and many members built new houses. At the same time, all members proposed 2.2 million rubles as a fund to consolidate the production base of the collective farm and expand and improve the public economy.
    The farm has built many comfortable field dormitories for its members and tractor drivers. Kindergartens are also set up during the busy farming season. In order to meet the members' cultural learning needs, the farm has established a mechanics school and various training courses for its members. In addition, there are clubs, a red cultural palace, film projection stations, radio stations, and a library. This farm has six schools, including a ten-year middle school, and the children of the members all have the opportunity to go to school.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the government, this collective farm has every possibility of achieving further organizational and economic upsurges, making the lives of collective farm members more prosperous.

    苏联斯大林集体农庄
    在苏联莫斯科近郊有一个斯大林集体农庄。
    这个集体农庄是由八个集体农庄合并后成立的，共有两万三千公顷土地。由于开垦荒地的结果，现在已把播种面积扩大到两万六千公顷。谷类作物在集体农庄的生产中占主要地位。除此还种植蓖麻子、向日葵、蔬菜、水果和其它技术作物；养蚕、畜牧业也很发达。
    农庄的各个部门都是由各种专家，如农艺师、机械工程师、建筑工程师、受过高等教育的饲养员、经济计划师以及其它专家指导着。他们都是集体农庄的成员，其中有些人被选为农庄管理处的委员。
    为了达到更高的收成，在一百五十公顷的实验场上，在农艺师的指导下，进行着各种谷物、技术作物、农艺、施肥的新方法实验，并把实验的成果运用到生产中去。此外还采用了深耕法。在生产提高的基础上，集体农庄一九五三年的谷物收获量比一九五○年增加了一倍。牛从一千五百四十一头增加到两千五百头，猪从九百头增加到两千五百头，马从三百九十五匹增加到五百六十匹，羊和家禽也增加了很多。一九五二年集体农庄从养畜业中获得了三百零七万一千卢布的收入；一九五三年他们又超过了苏共中央九月全会中所规定的饲畜业发展水平两倍到两倍半。
    在分配收入时，每一个庄员一个劳动日，除蔬菜和其它产品外，还领到六个多卢布和三公斤半粮食。有许多家庭领到了几吨的粮食，也有许多庄员修建了新房屋。同时全体庄员还提出了二百二十万卢布作为巩固集体农庄生产基础，扩大与改善公共经济的基金。
    农庄为庄员们和拖拉机手们建筑了许多舒适的田场宿舍。在农忙季节还设立了幼儿园。为了满足庄员们学习文化的要求，农庄为庄员们设立了机械师学校和各种训练班。此外还有俱乐部、红色文化宫、电影放映站、广播站、图书馆。这个农庄共有六所学校，其中有一所是十年制的中学，庄员们的孩子都能得到上学的机会。
    这个集体农庄在苏联共产党和政府的领导下，有一切可能性获得在组织上和经济上的进一步高涨，使集体农庄庄员们的生活更加富裕。
