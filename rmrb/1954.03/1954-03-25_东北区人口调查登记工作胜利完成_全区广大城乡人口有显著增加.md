    Northeast Region Population Survey and Registration Work Successfully Completed
    Significant Increase in Urban and Rural Population Across the Region

    [Our Newspaper] The population survey and registration work conducted in the Northeast Region during the grassroots elections has been successfully completed.  Lüda, Anshan, Fushun, and Changchun cities, along with Rehe, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces, completed their comprehensive statistics work at the provincial and municipal levels by the end of February.  Shenyang, Benxi, and Harbin cities, and Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Heilongjiang provinces are actively conducting comprehensive statistics based on counties and urban districts, and are expected to complete the provincial and municipal comprehensive statistics work in April.

    Comprehensive statistical materials from various parts of the Northeast show a significant increase in the region's urban and rural population. According to statistics from 11,653 grassroots units in Rehe, Songjiang, and Jilin provinces, the permanent resident population (excluding supplementary registrations) increased by 6.99 percent compared to 1952, with Songjiang Province's 3,905 grassroots units showing a population increase of 11.78 percent. The population growth rate is higher in urban areas than in rural areas. According to statistics from 57 urban units in Jilin Province, the population increased by 21.48 percent. Qiqihar City in Heilongjiang Province increased by 10.54 percent. The population increase in key industrial and mining cities throughout the region is even more rapid. According to statistics from the four cities of Anshan, Fushun, Fuxin, and the urban area of ​​Shenyang, the population increased by an average of 27.44 percent. The "Steel Capital" of the motherland, Anshan City, increased by 54.07 percent; the famous "Coal Capital" Fushun City increased by 20.97 percent; and the emerging heavy industrial city of Fuxin City increased by 71.49 percent.

    The reasons for the annual increase in urban and rural populations are mainly due to the significant improvement in the living standards of urban and rural people and the gradual improvement of health and medical services over the past few years with the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, resulting in a yearly increase in the birth rate and a yearly decrease in the death rate. There are two factors contributing to the increase in the urban population: one is the natural growth rate. According to statistics of the urban population of the entire region in 1952, the natural change rate increased by 0.59 percent compared to 1951; the second is the large increase in the mechanical change rate (in-migration exceeding out-migration). For example, in Anshan City in 1952, the natural change rate increased by 3.77 percent, and the mechanical change rate increased by 15.28 percent. This fully demonstrates the country's rapid industrial development and the increasing prosperity of the national economy.

    Thanks to the extensive and in-depth publicity beforehand, the broad masses of people recognized the great significance of the population survey to the country's construction undertakings and its direct relationship to the general election movement. They actively participated in and supported the population survey and registration work in the Northeast region. At the same time, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels and the efforts of the staff, the population survey and registration basically met the requirements of "no duplication, no omission, comprehensive, and accurate."  Sampling results from forty-one villages in thirty-five counties of Songjiang and Liaoxi provinces proved that thirty-nine villages achieved 100% accuracy, with only two villages showing a duplication/omission rate of 0.25%.  Various localities have universally conducted inspections and re-checks after the survey and registration to promptly correct errors that have occurred and prevent possible errors. Therefore, the data from this population survey not only enables the smooth progress of the general election, but more importantly, provides reliable population figures for the country's planned socialist construction.

    According to the experience of various parts of the Northeast, comprehensive population statistics work should be centralized at the county and municipal district levels, as well as cities not divided into districts, in order to achieve practical accuracy. The results of any work that is delegated to grassroots units for decentralized statistics are prone to errors and waste, leading to rework. However, to facilitate inspection and verification, statistical groups may be formed under the unified leadership of the county to work in districts and villages.

    东北区人口调查登记工作胜利完成
    全区广大城乡人口有显著增加
    【本报讯】东北区在基层选举中进行的人口调查登记工作已经胜利完成。旅大、鞍山、抚顺、长春四市和热河、松江、吉林三省在二月底就已完成省市的综合统计工作。沈阳、本溪、哈尔滨三市和辽东、辽西、黑龙江三省正在积极进行以县和市区为单位的综合统计，四月份可以全部完成省市的综合统计工作。
    东北各地人口综合统计材料表明：东北区城乡人口数字已有显著增加。根据热河、松江、吉林三省的一万一千六百五十三个基层单位的统计，常住人口（未包括补登人口）比一九五二年增加了百分之六点九九，松江省的三千九百零五个基层单位的人口增加了百分之十一点七八。人口增加率，城镇较农村为高。根据吉林省的五十七个城镇单位的统计，人口增加了百分之二十一点四八。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市增加了百分之十点五四。全区重要工矿城市人口增加得更为迅速。根据鞍山、抚顺、阜新及沈阳市区四个城市的统计，人口平均增加了百分之二十七点四四。祖国钢都鞍山市增加了百分之五十四点零七；著名的煤都抚顺市增加了百分之二十点九七；新兴的重工业城市阜新市增加了百分之七十一点四九。
    城乡人口逐年增加的原因，主要是几年来随着工农业生产的恢复和发展，城乡人民生活有了很大的改善，卫生医疗事业逐步改进，因而人口出生率逐年增加，死亡率逐年下降。城市人口的增加有两个因素：一是自然率的增长。根据一九五二年全区城镇人口的统计，自然变动率较一九五一年增加了百分之零点五九；二是机械变动率的增长（迁入大于迁出）很大，如鞍山市在一九五二年自然变动率增加了百分之三点七七，机械变动率增加了百分之十五点二八，这充分显示了国家的工业飞跃发展和国民经济的日益繁荣。
    东北地区的人口调查登记工作，由于事先广泛深入地进行了宣传，广大群众认识到人口调查对国家建设事业的重大意义和对普选运动的直接关系，因而积极地参加和支持；同时也由于各级党政领导的重视和工作人员的努力，使人口调查登记基本上达到了“不重复、不遗漏、全面、准确”的要求。松江、辽西两省三十五个县的四十一个村的抽查结果证明：三十九个村都达到了百分之百的准确，只有两个村重复、遗漏人口百分之零点二五。各地在调查登记后普遍做了检查和复查，及时纠正了已经发生和防止了可能发生的差错。因此，这次人口调查的资料，不仅使普选工作得以顺利进行，更重要的是给国家有计划的社会主义建设提供了可靠的人口数字。
    据东北各地的经验，综合统计人口工作应该集中到县和市辖区及不设区的市来做，才能作到切实精确，凡是推给基层单位分散统计的，结果都是错误多、浪费大，以致返工。但为便于检查核对，在县的统一领导下，也可组成统计小组，深入区、村工作。
