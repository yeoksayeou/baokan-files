Xinhua News Agency, 6th. As the date of the Geneva Conference approaches, Washington, Paris, and Saigon are increasingly busy trying to dress up the Bao Dai puppet.

Bao Dai's "Prime Minister" Bao Luu arrived in Paris from Saigon on the 3rd to prepare for further negotiations with France on the conclusion of a so-called "independent" "Franco-Vietnamese Treaty." France and Bao Dai have held many negotiations on the so-called "independence" issue. Because the United States wants to take over Vietnam, which is under French colonial rule, through this so-called "independence" negotiation, and the French ruling group is trying its best to hold on to Vietnam, the negotiations have always failed to produce a so-called "independent" Bao Dai. This "Franco-Vietnamese negotiation" is a repeat of the old tune. Its purpose is to create a deceptive "independence" to serve as capital for the U.S. and France to bargain at the Geneva Conference.

The U.S. official propaganda agency, the United States Information Service, calls this "Franco-Vietnamese negotiation" an "important negotiation directly related to the Geneva Conference next month." This is by no means accidental. Bao Dai was raised single-handedly by France after it launched the war of aggression against Vietnam in order to whitewash this unpopular war. Now that the call for an end to the Indochina War is getting louder and louder, it seems increasingly important to raise Bao Dai's "status." For the United States, the Indochina War is a "magic weapon" for maintaining and deepening tensions in the Far East.

Washington's concern for the "Franco-Vietnamese negotiation" is not only to increase the Western countries' political capital at the Geneva Conference, but also to take this opportunity to realize its consistent proposition of replacing France in Indochina.

However, no matter what kind of clothes Paris or Washington puts on the Bao Dai group, people clearly remember that Bao Dai was an infant emperor raised on foreign money since he was a child. He indulged in a life of pleasure and earned the title of "Nightclub Emperor." During the Japanese imperialist occupation of Vietnam, he obediently switched to another master. In 1946, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. At that time, Bao Dai officially announced his "abdication." Subsequently, he fled Vietnam and, relying on American intervention, held several "independence" negotiations with France. France, which was at a loss militarily, attempted to use Bao Dai's re-emergence to deceive the Vietnamese people and finally signed the so-called "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" with Bao Dai on March 8, 1949, recognizing Bao Dai's so-called "independence" within the French Federation. In June of the same year, Bao Dai returned to the French-occupied area of Vietnam and took the stage. However, the facts of the past few years have proved that France's bet was wrong. Bao Dai has been increasingly spurned by the Vietnamese people, while President Ho Chi Minh has won more and more enthusiastic love and support from the Vietnamese people in leading the war of resistance against aggression. Even Hudson, an Associated Press correspondent in Paris, recently admitted: "France chose Bao Dai to unite the Vietnamese people in the struggle against the Viet Minh. Because they could not find any solution that seemed better, they had to call Bao Dai to come forward with suspicion. After four years, it is generally believed that Bao Dai is far from significant success, but there is still no other solution in sight." He pointed out: "Bao Dai has not been able to win the full support that is necessary for him personally and for his cause. As time goes by, his prestige seems to be constantly declining. Bao Dai dismissed Prime Minister Nguyen Van Tam because Nguyen Van Tam's pro-French attitude was too blatant. He hoped to find a new Prime Minister who could get wider support. New Prime Minister Prince Bao Luu spent several weeks putting together his cabinet, and the resulting cabinet ministers seemed even less popular than Nguyen Van Tam."

The United States' attempt to put another "independent" coat on Bao Dai to increase Bao Dai's political capital is futile. After all, puppets are lifeless toys.

    美法急于把保大装扮成“独立”的傀儡
    妄图在日内瓦会议上作为讨价还价的资本
    【新华社六日讯】随着日内瓦会议召开日期的临近，华盛顿、巴黎和西贡越加忙碌，想把保大傀儡打扮起来。
    保大的“总理”保禄已在三日从西贡到达巴黎，准备再和法国谈判缔结所谓“独立”的“法越条约”。法国和保大关于所谓“独立”问题的谈判，已经举行过多次了。由于美国想借着这种所谓“独立”谈判把在法国殖民统治下的越南据为己有，而法国统治集团则极力想抓紧越南不放，因此，谈来谈去，总是弄不出一个所谓“独立”的保大来。这一次“法越谈判”是老调重弹，其目的是想制造一种骗人的“独立”来为美、法在日内瓦会议上讨价还价充当资本。
    美国官方宣传机关美国新闻处把这次“法越谈判”叫做“与下月日内瓦会议有直接关系的重要谈判”。这决不是偶然的。保大是法国发动侵略越南的战争后一手扶起来的，为的是粉饰这个不得人心的战争。现在要求结束印度支那战争的呼声越来越高，提高保大的“身价”看来就益发重要了，对美国来说，印度支那战争正是在远东保持并加深紧张局势的“法宝”。
    华盛顿方面这样关心“法越谈判”，除了为了增加西方国家在日内瓦会议上的政治资本之外，还想借此实现它的一贯主张，在印度支那取法国而代之。
    但是，无论如何，不管巴黎或华盛顿给保大集团披上什么样的外衣，人们清楚地记得：保大从小就是外国金钱豢养出来的一个儿皇帝。他耽溺于声色犬马，得到了“夜总会皇帝”的称号。在日本帝国主义占领越南期间，他顺从地换了一个主子。一九四六年越南人民在胡志明主席领导下建立了越南民主共和国。当时保大曾正式宣布“退位”。随后，他逃出了越南，倚靠美国的干预，和法国举行了多次“独立”谈判。在军事上一筹莫展的法国，企图利用保大重新出场来欺骗越南人民，终于在一九四九年三月八日和保大签订了所谓“法越协定”，承认保大在法兰西联邦内的所谓“独立”。同年六月，保大回到越南法占区，袍笏登场。但是，几年来的事实证明法国的赌注押错了。保大越来越遭到越南人民的唾弃，而胡志明主席在领导越南人民抵抗侵略的战争中越来越赢得了越南人民更加热烈的爱戴和拥护。甚至美联社驻巴黎记者赫德逊在最近都承认：“法国选择了保大在与越盟的斗争中来团结越南人民。由于找不到任何看起来是更好的解决办法，所以不得已怀着疑虑叫保大来出头。在经过了四年以后，人们普遍认为保大离显著的成功差得很远，但是仍旧看不到其他解决办法。”他指出：“保大一直没有能够赢得对他个人和他的事业都很必要的全力支持。随着时间的消逝，他的威望似乎在不断减少。保大解除了阮文心的总理职务，因为阮文心的亲法态度表现得太露骨了，他希望物色一位能够得到较广泛的支持的新总理。新总理保禄亲王花了好几个星期的时间才把他的内阁拼凑成功，结果组成的内阁的部长们似乎比阮文心更不孚众望。”
    美国企图要法国在保大身上再披上一件“独立”的外衣来增加保大的政治资本是徒然的。傀儡毕竟是没有生命的玩偶。
