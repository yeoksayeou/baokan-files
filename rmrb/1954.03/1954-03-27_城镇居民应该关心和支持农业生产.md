Reader's Letters Summary

    Editor's Note: The practice of the Lantian District People's Government in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, in mobilizing residents to combine sanitation work and help nearby farmers accumulate fertilizer is very good. The situation of farmers buying manure from nearby towns for production needs exists in various places. However, some urban residents, and even government offices, take the opportunity to raise prices and adulterate fertilizer to deceive farmers when they urgently need it; the erroneous behavior of the Grain Bureau in Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, is a relatively prominent example of this. This behavior is not only detrimental to farmers' increased production, but also affects the unity of urban and rural people and the political prestige of the People's Government. Although the leading organs of Tonglu County have now corrected the Grain Bureau's behavior of raising manure prices, Party and government leading organs in various places should still pay attention to preventing this situation and learn from the practice of Lantian District, educating urban residents to actively care about and support farmers' production.
    Urban Residents Should Care About and Support Agricultural Production
    Lantian District Residents Help Farmers Solve the Difficulty of Fertilizer Shortage
    Li Song, Guangming Street, Lantian District, Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, writes: In the past, some residents in Lantian District often raised manure prices or mixed mud and water into the manure when farmers came to the district to buy manure during the spring plowing season. This bad behavior made farmers very dissatisfied. In order to correct this phenomenon, the District People's Government convened a meeting of cadres from all seven streets in the city on February 13 this year, mobilizing the people of the district to accumulate fertilizer in conjunction with sanitation work and sell it to farmers at reasonable prices to support agricultural production. Cadres from each street mobilized residents to discuss this issue. Everyone realized the benefits of doing so and took action. Cadres from Guangming Street led the masses in the whole street to sweep garbage and dig ditches. They accumulated more than 1,200 dan of compost in three days. According to incomplete statistics, nearly 10,000 dan of various composts have been accumulated in the city. As a result, it not only helped farmers solve some of the difficulties in fertilizer shortage and ensured the health of the people in the district, but also further strengthened the unity of urban and rural people. The Grain Bureau of Tonglu County was criticized for raising manure prices.
    Xu Dejian and Shi Afa of the People's Government of Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, write: Some organs, schools, and many residents in our Tonglu County have contracts with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Sanhe, Jindong, Yangzhou, and other townships near the county seat to supply human manure. In the first half of 1953, the price of each dan of manure was 2,000 yuan. However, due to the increased enthusiasm of farmers for production, the number of people coming to the city to buy manure increased day by day. Some individual organs in the city saw this situation and raised the manure price to 3,000 or 4,000 yuan. Farmers were very dissatisfied. They said: Prices are stable, but human manure is rising in price! However, in January of this year, the Grain Bureau of the County People's Government raised the manure price to 5,000 yuan per dan. Several rural work cadres wrote letters to the person in charge of the bureau to express their opinions. Although the leading comrades of our county criticized this phenomenon at an enlarged cadre meeting, according to our understanding, the increase in human manure prices is by no means limited to Tonglu County. Therefore, we suggest that all localities pay attention to preventing this phenomenon.

### 城镇居民应该关心和支持农业生产

专栏：读者来信摘要

    编者按：湖南涟源县蓝田市区人民政府发动居民结合卫生工作，帮助附近农民积肥的做法是很好的。农民向附近城镇购买粪肥以供生产需要的情况，在各地都有。但是，某些城镇的居民甚至机关，却在农民急需肥料的时候，乘机抬价掺假，来欺骗农民；浙江桐庐县粮食局的错误行为就是其中一个比较突出的例子。这种行为不仅对农民增产不利，而且还影响了城乡人民的团结和人民政府的政治威信。现在桐庐县领导机关虽已纠正了粮食局抬高粪价的行为，但各地党政领导机关仍应注意防止这种情况，并学习蓝田市区的做法，教育城镇居民积极关心和支援农民生产。
    城镇居民应该关心和支持农业生产
    蓝田市区居民帮助农民解决缺肥困难
    湖南涟源县蓝田市区光明街李嵩来信：过去蓝田市区有些居民在春耕季节农民到市区购买粪肥时，往往抬高粪价，或者在粪里掺泥倒水。这种恶劣的行为，使农民很不满意。为了纠正这种现象，市区人民政府在今年二月十三日召开了全市七个街的干部会议，发动市区人民结合清洁卫生工作，积蓄肥料，并以合理价格卖给农民，支持农业生产。各街干部就发动居民讨论了这个问题，大家认识了这样做的好处，就都行动起来。光明街干部带动全街群众扫垃圾、挖沟坑，在三天内就积了一千二百多担堆肥。据不完全统计，全市已积各种堆肥将近一万担。这样做的结果，不仅帮助农民解决了部分缺肥的困难，保障了市区人民的健康，还进一步加强了城乡人民的团结。桐庐县粮食局提高粪价受到批评
    浙江桐庐县人民政府徐德健、施阿法来信：我们桐庐县城里的一些机关、学校和不少居民，与县城附近三合、金东、洋洲等乡的农业生产合作社、互助组订有供应人粪的合同。一九五三年上半年，每担粪价为两千元。但由于农民生产积极性的提高，进城买粪的就一天比一天多。城内个别机关看到这种情况，竟把粪价抬高到三、四千元。农民非常不满意，他们说：物价稳定了，人粪却在涨价！可是，今年一月，县人民政府粮食局竟又将粪价抬高到每担五千元。有几个乡村工作干部写信给该局负责人提出意见。我县领导同志虽然在扩大干部会上批判了这种现象，但据我们了解，人粪涨价的事情，绝不只发生在桐庐县城。因此，我们建议各地都能注意防止这种现象。
