    Zhejiang Oil Company Successfully Extracts Oil from Silkworm Pupae, Camphor Tree Seeds, etc.
    The Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China National Oils and Fats Corporation has successfully extracted oil from silkworm pupae, camphor tree seeds, and tea tree seeds, and has begun supplying the market.
    The oil yield from every 100 jin of dry silkworm pupae is 23%, and the cake yield is 82%. The pupae oil can be used as industrial oil and can also be refined for edible purposes. The pupae cake has a higher nitrogen content than soybean cake and can be used as fertilizer. At the same time, because the pupae cake has been steamed, fried, and pressed, the odor is reduced, and it can also be used as feed with good nutritional value. In the past, the utilization of silkworm pupae in silk-producing areas was not valued, and only a portion was used as chicken and duck feed.
    The oil yield from camphor tree seeds is 32%, and the cake yield is 65%. Camphor seed oil is a drying oil with a fragrant aroma and is a high-quality raw material for manufacturing scented soaps. In the past, no one paid attention to using it for oil extraction, so there were no purchases. Now, in order to expand the source of oil and meet industrial needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Company has entrusted cooperatives to vigorously carry out purchases.
    After shelling tea tree seeds, the oil yield of tea tree seed kernels is 24%, and the cake yield is 65%. The oil is brownish-yellow and transparent. In addition to being edible, it can also be used as a raw material for manufacturing soap and as machine lubricating oil. In the future, if tea tree seeds can be fully utilized for oil extraction, a large amount of oil source can be increased. At the same time, removing the tea seeds from the tea tree is also beneficial to the growth of the tea leaves.
    The above-mentioned new oil sources are simple to extract, and can be utilized with general wooden presses. The operation process is roughly the same as extracting rapeseed and Chinese tallow tree seed oil.
    In view of the large output of the above-mentioned new oil sources, easy extraction, and convenient collection and utilization, the China National Oils and Fats Corporation has notified its affiliated units to work with cooperatives to extensively mobilize farmers to collect, vigorously expand purchases, and carry out extraction to supply market needs.

    浙江油脂公司利用蚕蛹樟树籽等榨油成功
    中国油脂公司浙江省公司利用蚕蛹、樟树籽、茶树籽进行榨油成功，并已开始供应市场需要。
    每一百斤干蚕蛹出油率为百分之二十三，出饼率为百分之八十二。蛹油除可作为工业用油外，经过精炼后尚可作为食用。蛹饼含氮量超过豆饼，可用作肥料。同时蛹饼因已经过蒸炒榨制，气味减少，也可用作饲料，而且营养价值很好。过去各产丝区对蚕蛹的利用并未重视，仅有部分作为鸡鸭饲料。
    樟树籽出油率为百分之三十二，出饼率为百分之六十五。樟籽油为干性油品，气味芬芳，是制造香皂的上等原料。过去因为没人注意用它榨油，就没有收购。现在浙江省公司为了扩大油料来源，满足工业上需要，已委托合作社大力进行收购。
    茶树籽去壳后，茶树籽仁的出油率为百分之二十四，出饼率为百分之六十五，油色棕黄透明，除可供食用外，还可作制造肥皂的原料及机器润滑油等，今后如能充分利用茶树籽榨油，当可增加大量油源。同时茶叶树摘去茶籽以后，对茶叶生长也是有好处的。
    以上新油源榨制的方法简单，利用一般木榨即可，操作过程与榨制菜籽、桕籽油等大体相同。
    中国油脂公司鉴于上述新油源产量较大，榨制容易，便于收集和利用，已通知所属单位结合合作社，广泛发动农民进行收集，大力展开收购，进行榨制，以供应市场需要。（胡宏绩）
