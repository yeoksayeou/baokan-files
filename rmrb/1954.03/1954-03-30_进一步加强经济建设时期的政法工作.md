    Further Strengthen Political and Legal Work During the Economic Construction Period
    This year is the second year of the implementation of our country's first Five-Year Plan. With the rapid development of the national economy, we must further strengthen political and legal work. The State Council of the Central People's Government approved the State Council's Political and Legal Affairs Committee's "Main Tasks of Political and Legal Work in 1954." It requires further improving the people's democratic system, improving and applying the people's democratic legal system, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction and various socialist transformation undertakings. Around this general task, a series of specific tasks are stipulated in legislation, judiciary, procuratorate, public security, and civil affairs. Doing these many specific tasks well will prevent economic construction from being sabotaged by counter-revolutionaries or harmed by various criminals and passive slackers. It can have a huge promoting and protecting effect on economic construction, so that the liberated social productive forces can further develop rapidly.
    Some comrades believe that since the large-scale social reform movements such as land reform have been basically completed, and economic construction has become the central task of the country, political and legal work is not as important as before, and it is not necessary to use as much effort as before. Some political and legal cadres have even become uneasy. This is completely wrong. It is very clear: if we do not have a strong state machine of the people's democratic dictatorship today, if we only bury ourselves in economic work, become intoxicated with the victory of economic construction, forget the aggression of American imperialism against us, forget the sabotage activities of all counter-revolutionaries, forget the complex class struggles in the future socialist transformation process, and think that economic work is everything, then we will make extremely serious mistakes in politics. Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized the importance of strengthening the dictatorship during the period of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and pointed out that this is the fundamental difference between Marxism and anarchism and opportunism. Therefore, we must wage an irreconcilable struggle against all erroneous tendencies that advocate relaxing and weakening political and legal work.
    In order to guarantee and promote the cause of economic construction, what should the political and legal work departments mainly do?
    Under the unified leadership of Party and government leading organs and election committees, the political and legal departments should strive to complete the general election work and realize the people's congress system through general election. This is a further development of our country's people's democratic politics, and it will further improve and perfect the people's democratic system. The people's representative conference system implemented in the past was in line with the content and essence of the people's democratic system, and it has greatly promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in managing state affairs. However, this is not enough today. With the convening of the People's Congress, we will more effectively implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction that "all important work of the People's Government should be submitted to the People's Representative Conference for discussion and decision," so that the people's democratic system will be more complete, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in managing state affairs will be brought into full play, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in economic construction and socialist transformation will be brought into full play, so that the country's general task will become the conscious goal of struggle for the broad masses of the people. With the convening of the People's Congress, we will make the work of political power construction in cities, industrial and mining areas, and even the vast rural areas more adapted to the needs of production, so that social production and various socialist transformation undertakings will continue to move forward.
    With the advent of the period of large-scale planned economic construction, the legislative work, judicial work, procuratorial work, and public security work to protect economic construction also need to be greatly strengthened, so that the people's democratic legal system will be gradually improved and perfected. In terms of legislation, on the basis of the various laws and regulations that have been formulated in the past, we should further start drafting and deliberating various necessary regulations, especially regulations related to economic construction. In terms of justice, we must strengthen the inspection and trial of cases related to economic construction, such as industrial and mining production, basic construction, transportation, rural mutual assistance and cooperation, and illegal cases of capitalist industry and commerce. In terms of public security, we must further strengthen reconnaissance work in the hidden struggle against the enemy, vigorously protect economic construction, especially protect important factories, mines, transportation, finance and economics, and trade departments. In general, in addition to continuing to severely suppress counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, necessary legal sanctions should also be implemented against other criminals who endanger national construction and the people's democratic order. At the same time, we must strengthen the education on law-abiding and labor discipline for all state personnel and all citizens, and gradually enable everyone to raise their socialist consciousness and consciously abide by laws and disciplines. This requires that political and legal work must go deep into factories and mines, into rural mutual aid groups and cooperatives, and into other economic work departments to establish its own business.
    Special education should be given to all state personnel and all people to do their best to protect state property and strive to accumulate state property. We should continue to oppose all crimes of corruption and theft of state property, and severely punish all corrupt and thieves in accordance with the law. We should constantly promote thrift, oppose waste, and give due punishment to serious wasters. We should oppose any phenomena of passive slackness and dereliction of duty in state organs and production undertakings. Serious accountability must be strictly investigated for major liability accidents. These are also the tasks of the political and legal departments.
    Under the people's democratic system and the people's democratic legal system that will be gradually improved, the people's democratic rights should be more fully protected. In the past, due to being in a tense war and large-scale social reform movements, the laws were not yet complete, the judicial system, especially the procuratorial system, was not sound, and some cadres in public security, judicial organs, and other aspects had the phenomena of being crude and careless, impure in organization, and violating laws and disciplines, resulting in the infringement of the democratic rights of some people. In order to overcome this phenomenon, in the future, we must give full protection to the people's democratic rights from the legislative aspect and from the aspect of improving the people's judicial, public security, and procuratorial systems. And no state organs and personnel are allowed to requisition the people's manpower, materials, and financial resources outside the state laws and regulations.
    To realize the above tasks, the ideological leadership of the working class is impossible without. In the past, in the construction of democratic political power, we criticized the viewpoint that only paid attention to democratic forms, not to the essence of democracy, and reversed the relationship between the essence of democracy and democratic forms, and also criticized the formalism in the people's representative conferences at all levels that was not conducive to the expression of opinions by the working people. In terms of legal work, we have criticized and struggled against the reactionary "Six Codes" old legal viewpoints and the so-called supra-class viewpoints, which are actually viewpoints that do not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. In terms of public security work, we have overcome the remaining reactionary old police style among some public security personnel and established a public police style of serving the people. Through these efforts, we have established and strengthened the leading position of the working class ideology in political and legal work. In the future, we must continue to strengthen the ideological leadership of the working class and constantly criticize erroneous ideas in order to guarantee and promote the smooth progress of the national industrialization and socialist transformation from the aspect of political and legal work.
    In the specific work of the People's Congress implementing the general election, in the specific work of improving the people's democratic legal system, especially in the specific work of ensuring the smooth progress of economic construction, the cadres of the political and legal departments have encountered many unfamiliar new problems, and past experience is far from enough. Therefore, all political and legal workers, especially leading cadres, must learn from scratch. Everyone should go deep into the masses and grassroots organizations, deep into factories, mines, various economic departments, and rural areas, humbly learn from the masses, carefully investigate and study what the people, especially workers and peasants, have created, negated, need, and oppose in their actual lives, what are the factors that promote industrial and agricultural production and socialist transformation, what are the obstacles to progress, and timely discover and summarize the actual experience of political and legal work in various places, promote advanced experience, and correct erroneous tendencies. This year, the political and legal departments will conduct key experiments on political and legal work in several important cities, factories, mines, railways, and along waterways, and experiment in several counties on how political and legal work guarantees and promotes the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement of agricultural production. This is an important way to create experience and promote work, and it is also an important way to educate and improve cadres. All localities should practically and conscientiously organize and lead these tasks to make it have good results.
    In terms of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, many things in the political and legal departments still remain in the learning of general theories; the learning of specific business experiences related to political and legal affairs is still far from enough. Now we must systematically carry out this kind of learning in combination with our country's specific situation and practical experience. In order to summarize our rich practical experience and make it systematized; in order to correctly use the experience of the Soviet Union, we must conscientiously and systematically study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, especially the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state; conscientiously and systematically study the general line of the Party and the state in the transition period; study the Party and the state's various policies, clarify the viewpoint of political and legal work serving socialist economic construction, so as to improve the theoretical level and policy level of political and legal workers, overcome blindness in work, and improve work ability.
    In the great period of economic construction and socialist transformation, the tasks of political and legal work are more arduous and heavier. All comrades in the posts of political and legal work should redouble their efforts, study hard in their own work, constantly create, and constantly move forward, so that political and legal work can more powerfully and effectively guarantee and promote the great cause of the country's socialist industrialization and various socialist transformations, so that this cause can progress better and faster.

### 进一步加强经济建设时期的政法工作

    进一步加强经济建设时期的政法工作
    今年是我国第一个五年计划实施的第二个年度。随着国民经济的迅速发展，我们必须进一步加强政法工作。中央人民政府政务院批准了政务院政法委员会“一九五四年政法工作的主要任务”。它要求进一步健全人民民主制度，健全和运用人民民主法制，巩固人民民主专政，以保障经济建设和各种社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。围绕着这个总的任务，在立法、司法、检察、公安、民政各方面都规定了一系列的具体工作。这许多具体工作作得好，就会使经济建设事业不至于遭受反革命分子的破坏或各种犯罪分子和消极怠工分子的危害，就可以对经济建设事业发生巨大的推进和保护作用，使解放了的社会生产力进一步迅速发展。
    有些同志以为，既然土地改革等大规模的社会改革运动已经基本完成，经济建设已经成了全国中心任务，那么政法工作就没有从前那么重要，可以不必用从前那么大的力量去做了。有些政法工作干部甚至发生了不安心的现象。这是完全错误的。事情很清楚：如果我们今天没有强有力的人民民主专政的国家机器，如果我们只是埋头于经济工作，迷醉于经济建设的胜利，忘记了美帝国主义对我们的侵略，忘记了一切反革命分子的破坏活动，忘记了在今后社会主义改造过程中的复杂的阶级斗争，以为经济工作就是一切，那就要在政治上犯极大的错误。列宁、斯大林在苏联社会主义建设时期，都一再强调加强专政的重要意义，指出这是马克思主义与无政府主义、机会主义的根本区别。因此我们必须与一切主张放松和削弱政法工作的错误倾向进行不调和的斗争。
    为了保障和推进经济建设事业，政法工作部门主要应该作些什么呢？
    在党政领导机关和选举委员会统一领导下，政法部门应努力完成普选工作，实现普选的人民代表大会制度。这是我国人民民主政治的进一步的发展，它将使人民民主制度进一步健全和完备起来。过去实行的人民代表会议制度，曾是符合于人民民主制度的内容与实质的，它已经使人民群众管理国家事务的积极性和创造性大大发扬起来。但是，这在今天就显得很不够了。随着人民代表大会的召开，我们将更加切实地贯彻毛泽东同志关于“人民政府的一切重要工作都应交人民代表会议讨论，并作出决定”的指示，使人民民主制度更加完备，更加高度发挥人民群众在管理国家事务上的积极性和创造性，高度发挥人民群众在经济建设和社会主义改造事业上的积极性和创造性，使国家的总任务成为广大人民自觉的奋斗目标。随着人民代表大会的召开，我们将使城市、工矿区以至广大农村的政权建设工作更加适应生产的需要，使社会生产和各种社会主义改造的事业，不断地向前发展。
    随着大规模的有计划的经济建设时期的到来，保卫经济建设的立法工作、司法工作、检察工作和公安工作也需要大力加强，使人民民主的法制逐步地健全和完备起来。立法方面要在过去已经制订的各种法令的基础上，进一步着手起草和审议各种必要的法规，特别是有关经济建设的法规。司法方面要加强有关经济建设如工矿生产、基本建设、交通运输、农村互助合作中的案件和资本主义工商业的违法案件的检察和审判工作。公安方面要进一步加强对敌隐蔽斗争中的侦察工作，有力地保卫经济建设，特别是保卫重要的厂矿、交通、财经、贸易部门。总的说来，除了继续严厉镇压反革命破坏活动以外，对于其他危害国家建设和人民民主秩序的犯罪分子也要实行必要的法律制裁。与此同时，要加强对于全体国家工作人员和全体国民的守法教育，劳动纪律教育，逐渐使所有的人提高社会主义觉悟，都能自觉地遵守法律和纪律。这就必须使政法工作深入到工厂矿山中去，深入到农村的互助组合作社中去，深入到其他各种经济工作部门中去，建立自己的业务。
    应该特别教育国家全体工作人员和全体人民尽力保护国家财产，并努力积累国家财产。应该继续反对一切贪污、盗窃国家财产的罪行，并依法严厉制裁一切贪污和盗窃分子。应该不断地提倡节约，反对浪费，并给严重的浪费分子以应有的惩罚。应该反对国家机关和生产事业中的任何消极怠工、玩忽职守的现象。对于重大的责任事故必须严格查究。这些同样是政法部门的任务。
    在将要逐步完备起来的人民民主制度和人民民主法制之下，人民的民主权利应该受到更为充分的保护。过去由于处在紧张的战争和大规模的社会改革运动中，法律还很不完备，司法制度特别是检察制度还不健全，有些公安、司法机关及其他方面的干部还有粗枝大叶、组织不纯、违法乱纪的现象，以致有一些人民群众的民主权利受到侵犯。为克服这种现象，今后必须从立法方面，从健全人民司法、公安和检察制度方面，对人民的民主权利给予充分保护。并不许任何国家机关和工作人员在国家法令之外征用人民的人力、物力和财力。
    要实现上述任务，没有工人阶级的思想领导是不可能的。过去，我们在民主政权建设方面，曾经批判了那种只注意民主形式、不注意民主实质、把民主实质与民主形式的关系加以颠倒的观点，也批判了各级人民代表会议中种种不便于劳动人民表达意见的形式主义。在法律工作方面，我们曾经对反动的“六法全书”旧法观点和所谓超阶级的观点，实际是敌我不分的观点进行了批判和斗争。在公安工作方面，我们克服了一部分公安人员中残余的反动的旧警察作风，建立了为人民服务的人民警察的作风。经过这些努力，我们在政法工作中树立了和加强了工人阶级思想的领导地位。今后必须继续加强工人阶级的思想领导，不断地批判错误思想，才能从政法工作方面保障和促进国家工业化和社会主义改造事业顺利进行。
    在实行普选的人民代表大会的具体工作中，在健全人民民主法制的具体工作中，特别是在保障经济建设顺利进行的具体工作中，政法各部门的干部遇到了许多十分生疏的新问题，过去的经验已经十分不够用了。因此，全体政法工作人员，特别是领导干部，必须从头学起。大家要深入到群众中和基层组织中去，深入到工厂、矿山、各种经济部门和农村中去，虚心地向群众学习，细心地调查研究人民群众特别是工人、农民在实际生活中创造了什么，否定了什么，需要什么，反对什么，那些是推动工农业生产和社会主义改造的因素，那些是前进的障碍，及时地发现和总结各地政法工作中的实际经验，推广先进的经验，纠正错误倾向。今年政法部门要在若干重要城市、厂矿、铁路、水运沿线进行政法工作的重点试验，并在若干县份试验政法工作如何保障和推动农业生产互助合作运动的发展，这是创造经验、推进工作的重要办法，也是教育和提高干部的重要办法。各地应该切实地认真地组织和领导这些工作，使它有好的结果。
    政法部门在学习苏联先进经验方面，有许多还停留在一般理论的学习上；对有关政法的各种具体业务经验的学习，还作得十分不够。现在必须结合我国具体情况和实践经验，系统地进行这种学习。为了把我们丰富的实践经验总结起来，使它条理化；为了正确地运用苏联的经验，必须认真地、系统地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，特别是马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说；认真地系统地学习党和国家在过渡时期的总路线；学习党和国家的各项政策，明确政法工作为社会主义经济建设服务的观点，以提高政法工作人员的理论水平和政策水平，克服工作中的盲目性，提高工作能力。
    在伟大的经济建设和社会主义改造时期，政法工作的任务是更加艰巨、繁重了。所有政法工作岗位上的同志们应该百倍奋发起来，在自己的工作中刻苦钻研，不断地创造，不断地前进，使政法工作更有力、更有效地保障和推进国家的社会主义工业化和各种社会主义改造的伟大事业，使这个事业进展得更好，更快。
