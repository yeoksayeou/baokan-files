    Jia Peikui Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Mutual Aid Team in Yuanyaohe, Caogong Township, Third District, Yicheng, Shanxi Province, has, over the past three years, with the help of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, overcome difficulties in sales, purchases, and lack of funds, greatly promoting production development and improving the lives of farmers.
    Yuanyaohe is a small mountain village in southern Yicheng, where transportation is very inconvenient. In the past, farmers had to travel to Yicheng and other places more than ninety miles away to sell their products and exchange them for the necessities of their production and life, which took three or four days of production time for a round trip. In 1951, in order to help farmers in mountainous areas solve the difficulties of supply and marketing, the Yicheng People's Government established a grassroots supply and marketing cooperative in Xiyan Village, more than ten miles away from Yuanyaohe Village. The Jia Peikui Mutual Aid Team signed a combination contract with the supply and marketing cooperative. Since the Jia Peikui Mutual Aid Team signed the contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, not only did local and special products have sales channels, but they were also able to purchase high-quality and inexpensive production materials and necessities of life in a timely manner. During the spring plowing in 1952, the mutual aid team wanted to use warm water to soak the seeds, but they did not know how to control the temperature and did not have pesticides to mix with the seeds. The supply and marketing cooperative immediately supplied them with three thermometers and more than ten kilograms of "666" powder. In addition, it also supplied more than forty pieces of various forestry tools that could not be purchased in the market. In the past, farmers had to pay two hundred yuan for a needle from a private merchant, but the supply and marketing cooperative only charged five hundred yuan for a package (twenty-five needles), reducing the intermediate exploitation by private merchants. The masses of Yuanyaohe deeply felt the benefits of the supply and marketing cooperative to them from these many examples, so all sixty-four people in the village joined the supply and marketing cooperative. In the first two years of signing the contract, the supply and marketing cooperative sold local and special products such as medicinal materials, wood, and animal skins worth more than 42 million yuan on their behalf, and supplied production and living materials worth 32.8 million yuan.
    After the Jia Peikui Mutual Aid Team signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it also saved a large amount of labor and carried out land processing. The whole team carried out a round of embankment construction on more than 180 mu of autumn fields; 22 mu of mountain slopes were leveled into terraced fields. In addition, six water storage ponds were dug, and two new small canals were opened, solving the problem of drinking water.
    In order to solve the shortage of funds for expanding production and the temporary difficulties in the lives of some farmers, the Jia Peikui Mutual Aid Team also signed a combination contract with the Xiyan Village Credit Cooperative in 1952. The whole team only deposited 2,700 jin of coarse grains into the credit cooperative, but in the autumn, in order to develop animal husbandry, the mutual aid team borrowed 1.2 million yuan from the credit cooperative to buy 25 sheep; during the spring plowing in 1953, Jia Peikui and Hou Faxiang felt that the plowing cattle were weak, so they borrowed another 1.15 million yuan from the credit cooperative to buy and exchange two large cattle; six farmers were short of grain, and the credit cooperative promptly loaned more than 1,000 jin of grain to solve the difficulties of the grain-deficient households; Farmer Hou Zhaoming also built three new tile-roofed houses with the help of the credit cooperative. Therefore, the mutual aid team established close ties with the credit cooperative. Recently, the mutual aid team deposited another 2.32 million yuan that the team did not need at the moment into the credit cooperative.
    With the help of the supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives over the years, the Jia Peikui Mutual Aid Team has greatly improved the lives of its members. Ten out of the twelve households in the team have surplus grain, and every family has made new clothes, etc. In the past three years, the whole village has repaired five bungalows, built eleven new tile-roofed houses, and also established a primary school.

    贾培奎互助组得到供销合作社和信用合作社的帮助
    克服了供销和资金的困难发展了生产
    山西省翼城三区曹公乡元窑河贾培奎农、林、牧互助组，三年来在供销合作社和信用合作社的帮助下，克服了推销、购买和资金缺乏的困难，大大促进了生产的发展，改善了农民的生活。
    元窑河是翼城南的一个小山村，交通非常不便，过去农民要出售自己的产品和换回自己生产、生活上的必需品，都要跑到九十多里路以外的翼城等地去，往返一次要耽误三四天的生产时间。一九五一年，翼城人民政府为了帮助山区农民解决供销困难，在离元窑河村十几里路远的西阎村成立了基层供销合作社。贾培奎互助组就和供销合作社订了结合合同。贾培奎互助组自从和供销合作社订了合同后，不但土、特产品有了销路，而且能及时买到物美价廉的生产资料和生活上的必需品。一九五二年春耕时，互助组想用温汤浸种，但不会掌握温度又没有药剂拌种，供销合作社立即供应了他们三支温度计和十几斤“六六六”粉。另外，还供应了在市场上购买不到的各种林业工具四十多件。过去农民买私商的一根针就得二百元，供销社一包（二十五根）针才五百元，减少了私商的中间剥削。元窑河群众从这许多事例中亲切体会到供销合作社对他们的好处，因此全村六十四口人都加入了供销社。订立合同的最初两年，供销合作社共给他们代销了价值四千二百余万元的药材、木料、兽皮等土特产品，供应了价值三千二百八十万元的生产资料和生活资料。
    贾培奎互助组和供销合作社订立合同后，还节省了大批的劳动力，进行土地加工。全组一百八十多亩秋田，普遍进行了一次砌边垒堰；二十二亩山坡修整成了梯田。另外又挖了六个蓄水池，新开了两条小水渠，解决了吃水的困难。
    为了解决扩大生产资金的不足和部分农民生活上的暂时困难，一九五二年贾培奎互助组又和西阎村信用合作社订了结合合同。全组只存入信用合作社两千七百斤粗粮，但到秋后，互助组为了发展畜牧业就向信用合作社借了一百二十万元买了二十五只羊；一九五三年春耕时，贾培奎、侯发相嫌耕牛弱，又向信用社借了一百一十五万元新买和对换了两条大牛；有六户农民缺粮，信用社便及时贷给了一千多斤粮食解决了缺粮户的困难；农民侯兆明在信用社的扶助下还盖了三间新瓦房。因此，互助组与信用社建立了密切的联系。最近互助组又把本组当前尚用不着的二百三十二万元存入了信用合作社。
    贾培奎互助组数年来在供销、信用合作社的帮助下，大大改善了组员的生活，全组十二户就有十户有余粮，家家都添做了新衣服等。三年来全村共修补了五间平房，新盖十一间瓦房，还建立了一所小学校。
