Various People's Banks, under the unified leadership of local Party committees and governments, are actively developing rural credit cooperative organizations. In December of last year, the Southwest Branch of the People's Bank of China, under the leadership of the local Financial Committee, held a forum on credit cooperatives for the entire region. Participating in the meeting were leading cadres from various levels of the Party committee, banks, credit cooperatives, and organizational groups. After studying the general line, and through typical reports and exchange of experiences, the meeting preliminarily clarified the important role and basic tasks of credit cooperation in gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture during the country's transition period. It was decided, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, to adopt the policy of "active leadership, steady advance," and to formulate work plans suitable to specific circumstances based on local conditions. The Northeast, East China and other regions have also successively formulated plans for developing credit cooperative organizations this year. The Northeast region plans to develop to 3,500 or 4,000 credit cooperatives and sections this year; East China is preparing to build 5,500 new credit cooperatives and sections. The Yuezhong Office of the Guangdong Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to help farmers develop credit cooperative organizations, and plans to organize 144 credit cooperatives this spring.

    Cultivating cadres familiar with business is an important issue in consolidating and developing credit cooperatives. At present, many local banks, under the unified leadership of the Party committee and government, have held short-term credit cooperation training classes to study and exchange experience in running and managing cooperatives. The Dingxian Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of Hebei Province held a credit cooperation cadre training class in October of last year, focusing on learning from the experience of consolidating credit cooperatives. In January of this year, Xishui County, Hubei Province, held a credit cooperation cadre training class with more than 300 people. Macheng, Puchi, and Echeng counties, as well as the Anyang Central Sub-branch of Henan Province, Meixian County of Guangdong Province, and Haicheng County of Fujian Province, have also held credit cooperation cadre training classes to cultivate and educate cadres in order to further develop credit cooperative organizations.

    After receiving education on the general line, farmers in various regions have also requested to organize credit cooperative organizations. Farmers in eighteen townships in the Chengnan and Songyuan districts of Meixian County, Guangdong Province, have requested to join with more than 10,800 shares, and many farmers have already paid their shares. In the counties of Nanchang Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, there are 190 credit cooperatives that have been established or are being prepared for establishment, with members already paying more than 900 million yuan in shares. In Pengwan Township, Jiujiang County, the amount of farmer deposits reached more than 90 million yuan in just over a week after the credit cooperative opened. Fifteen new credit cooperatives have been established in twelve counties including Qingxu, Taigu, and Zuoquan in Shanxi Province, and 102 more are being prepared for establishment, expanding by a total of 60,221 shares, with a share capital of 1.50948 billion yuan.

    Now, the credit cooperatives and groups that are being established and expanded have launched deposit and loan services, effectively regulating funds in rural areas and helping farmers solve difficulties.

    各地积极发展信用合作组织
    各地人民银行在当地党委、政府统一领导下，积极发展农村信用合作组织。去年十二月，中国人民银行西南区行在当地财委领导下，召开了全区信用合作社座谈会，参加会议的有各级党委、银行及信用社、组负责干部。会议经过总路线的学习，和典型报告、交流经验，初步明确了信用合作在国家过渡时期逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造中的重要作用和基本任务。决定依据中共中央关于开展互助合作运动的指示精神，采取“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，因地制宜订出适合具体情况的工作计划。东北、华东等地区亦先后订出了今年发展信用合作组织的计划。东北区今年计划发展到三千五百个或四千个信用社、部；华东区准备新建五千五百个信用社、部。中国人民银行广东省分行粤中办事处，决定帮助农民发展信用合作组织，计划在今春组织一百四十四个信用合作社。
    培养熟悉业务的干部，是巩固和发展信用合作社的一个重要问题。目前，不少地区银行，在党委、政府统一领导下，举办了短期信用合作训练班，学习、交流办社和经营经验。河北省定县中心支行在去年十月举办了信用合作干部训练班，着重学习了巩固信用合作社的经验。湖北省浠水县，在今年一月，举办了三百余人的信用合作干部训练班。麻城、蒲圻、鄂城县及河南省安阳中心支行，广东省梅县、福建省海澄县等地，也都举办了信用合作干部训练班，培养教育干部，以进一步地发展信用合作组织。
    各地农民在经过总路线教育后也纷纷要求组织信用合作组织。广东省梅县城南、松源两个区十八个乡的农民要求加入一万零八百多股，许多农民已交股金。江西省南昌专区各县已经成立和正在筹备成立的信用合作社有一百九十个，其中社员已经缴纳的股金达九亿多元。九江县彭湾乡农民在信用合作社开业后的一个多星期内，农民存款额就达九千多万元。山西省清徐、太谷、左权等十二个县，已新建信用社十五个，还有一百零二个社正在筹备建立中，共扩了六万零二百二十一股，股金十五亿零九百四十八万元。
    现在，筹建和扩建的信用合作社、组，都已开展了存款、放款业务，有力地调剂了农村中的资金，帮助农民解决了困难。
