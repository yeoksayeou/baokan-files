Reader's Letters Abstract:

    The Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store Should Improve the Organization of Processing and Ordering Work
    Editor's Note: The following two reader's letters expose some shortcomings in the way the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store organizes private factories to process orders. A similar problem was exposed in the letter "Why Isn't the Deterioration of Towels Being Handled?" published on page three of this newspaper on February 12th. We believe that these situations should be taken seriously by the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store. We hope that, in conjunction with studying the General Line, they will conduct a more systematic review of their work in the past period to learn lessons and improve their work.

    Li Jizhong and Hu Yongqing of the Beijing Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce write: The Beijing Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce entrusted the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store last November to complete the task of processing white line gloves for the Beijing Purchasing Station of the Production Department of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region. Although the company had the conditions and experience to do this work well, more than ten days after the task was assigned, the department store section, because it "feared trouble," proposed that it "could not guarantee the quantity, quality, and specifications," and attempted to refuse to accept the task. This excuse was rejected by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, and then they used the excuse that "the production capacity is small, and it may be difficult to complete," and asked the Beijing Purchasing Station to find a solution in other areas. At that time, the Beijing Purchasing Station was afraid that the company would delay and affect the supply, so it had to send most of the gloves to other areas for processing; the remaining very small part of the task was reluctantly accepted by the company only after a decision by relevant departments.
    This matter could have been completed in a very short time, but due to the company's irresponsibility, it was delayed for as long as a month and a half, which not only wasted manpower and time but also affected the supply work of the troops.
    The Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store also has many shortcomings in organizing private factories to process orders. Here are just two examples of garment processing. When the Dongsi Garment Firm in Beijing processed cotton clothes for the company, it did not sign a processing contract at all, only relying on a shop guarantee. When the company paid cotton to the private merchants, it exceeded the required amount by 1,800 jin; the private merchants not only took the opportunity to misappropriate more than 800 jin of cotton to do business, but also cut corners, putting more than two liang less cotton in each cotton garment. According to preliminary investigations, the cotton and cotton cloth stolen from the state are worth more than ten million yuan. For example, when the company entrusted the Tongli Garment Firm in Beijing to process children's cotton overcoats, it also overpaid several hundred jin of cotton. The private merchants illegally reduced the size of the specified clothes, and in just over two months, they stole 2,000 chi of various cotton cloths and plush, worth about 8.9 million yuan in RMB. The processed garments were short in the body, thin in the waist, narrow in the cuffs, and small in the hats. Despite the poor quality of the products, the company did not check them, but accepted and sold them in a muddle-headed manner, which has been criticized by the masses. This not only caused losses to state property but also damaged the reputation of state-owned commerce.
    We believe that the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store should learn from the past lessons, conscientiously overcome bureaucracy, and lead its staff to conscientiously study the General Line to improve their political and ideological level and strengthen their sense of responsibility.
    (II)
    Hu Menggeng and Zhou Ying of the Hebei Provincial Cooperative General Society write: In May 1953, our Tianjin Special District Living Materials Wholesale Station (hereinafter referred to as the Tianjin Wholesale Station) ordered 7,327 boxes of Tiger Monkey brand matches produced by the private Housheng Match Factory from the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Department Store (hereinafter referred to as the Beijing Municipal Company). In July, 6,034 boxes were delivered, and the wholesale station distributed them to Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Handan, Tianjin, and other special districts for sale through the provincial society. Soon, cooperatives in various places discovered that this batch of matches had seriously deteriorated. The Tianjin Wholesale Station reported this situation to the Beijing Municipal Company and requested that they immediately send someone to various places to inspect; however, they adopted an attitude of ignoring it. It was not until November 3rd, when the Tianjin Wholesale Station sent a special person to Beijing Municipal Company to negotiate, that the Beijing Municipal Company, together with the Housheng Match Factory, sent people to various places to inspect. The results proved that the deterioration of the matches was very serious, with some having more than 60% unusable, and even the better ones having more than 13% unusable. Cooperatives in various parts of Hebei Province have suffered considerable political and economic losses as a result.
    The above-mentioned incident, on the one hand, shows that although the Beijing private Housheng Match Factory has undergone the "Five-Anti" movement, it still maintains a profit-seeking business style. On the other hand, it also shows that the Beijing Municipal Company has not fulfilled its due supervisory and leadership responsibilities when organizing private factories to process orders, and has delayed dealing with the problem for a long time after it occurred, which is completely not the attitude that state-owned commercial departments should have.

### 中国百货公司北京市公司应改进组织加工订货的工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    中国百货公司北京市公司应改进组织加工订货的工作
    编者按：下面摘要发表的两封读者来信揭发了中国百货公司北京市公司组织私营厂商加工订货时的一些缺点。在二月十二日本报三版发表的“为什么不处理毛巾变质事件”一信中也曾揭发过类似问题。我们认为这些情况应该引起中国百货公司北京市公司的重视，希望他们结合总路线的学习，把过去一个时期的工作作一次比较系统的检查，以接受教训，改进工作。
    （一）
    北京市人民政府工商管理局李积中、胡永庆来信：北京市工商管理局在去年十一月底曾委托中国百货公司北京市公司为华北军区后勤部生产部北京采购站完成加工白线手套的任务。该公司虽然有条件、也有经验来做好这项工作，但是在任务交下来十多天后，百货科却因为“怕麻烦”，提出“不能保证数量、质量和规格”，企图拒绝接受这一任务。这个借口被北京市商业局批驳了，随后他们又借口“生产力小，恐难完成”，要北京采购站去外埠想办法。当时北京采购站怕该公司一拖再拖而影响供应，只好把大部分手套都送到外埠去加工；剩下的极少一部分任务，还是经有关部门的决定，该公司才勉强接受了。
    这件事本来在很短的时间内就能办完，但由于该公司不负责任，竟拖了一个半月之久，不仅浪费了人力、时间，而且还影响了部队的供应工作。
    中国百货公司北京市公司在组织私营厂商加工订货时也有不少缺点，这里仅举两个服装加工的例子。北京市东四服装商行给该公司加工棉装时，根本没有签定加工合同，只凭打了个铺保。该公司在付给私商棉花时，超过应用量一千八百斤；私商不但乘机挪用了八百多斤棉花做生意，还偷工减料，在每件棉衣中少放二两多棉花。据初步调查，国家被盗窃的棉花、棉布即值一千多万元。又如该公司在委托北京市同力服装行加工小孩棉大衣时，同样超付棉花数百斤。私商非法缩小所规定的衣服尺码，仅二个多月就盗窃各种棉布和长毛绒二千尺，约值人民币八百九十万元。加工出来的服装身短、腰瘦、袖口短窄，帽子也小。尽管产品质量这样低劣，但该公司不加检查，就糊里糊涂收下出卖，因而受到群众很多批评。这不仅使国家的财产遭到损失，同时也破坏了国营商业的信誉。
    我们认为，中国百货公司北京市公司应该接受过去的教训，认真克服官僚主义，并领导工作人员认真学习总路线，以提高政策思想水平，加强工作责任心。
    （二）
    河北省合作总社胡梦更、周英来信：一九五三年五月间，我社天津专区生活资料批发站（以下简称天津批发站）向中国百货公司北京市公司（以下简称北京市公司）订购私营厚生火柴厂出品的虎猴牌火柴七千三百二十七箱。七月间交货六千零三十四箱，批发站就通过省社调发保定、石家庄、邯郸、天津等专区销售。不久，各地合作社都发现这批火柴已经严重变质。天津批发站就把这一情况反映到北京市公司，并要求立即派人到各地检查；但他们却采取了置之不理的态度。直到十一月三日，天津批发站派专人到北京市公司交涉，北京市公司才会同厚生火柴厂派人到各地检查，结果证明火柴变质的情况很严重，有些有百分之六十以上已不能使用，较好的也有百分之十三以上不能使用。河北省各地合作社因此在政治上和经济上都已受到不少损失。
    上述事件，一方面说明了北京私营厚生火柴厂虽然经过“五反”运动，但还依然存在着唯利是图的经营作风。另一方面也说明了北京市公司在组织私营工厂加工订货时还没有尽到应有的监督和领导责任，而当问题发生后又长期拖延不作处理，这完全不是国营商业部门所应有的态度。
