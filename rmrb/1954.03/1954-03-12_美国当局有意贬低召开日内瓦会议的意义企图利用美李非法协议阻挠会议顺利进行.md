Xinhua News Agency, March 11th:

The US authorities have made no constructive efforts regarding the Geneva Conference issue since the end of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Recently, they have deliberately downplayed the significance of the Geneva Conference—a conference intended to seek solutions to pressing Asian issues through great power consultations and ease international tensions. They are portraying the Geneva Conference as a substitute for the Korean political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, while also attempting to influence the smooth convening and progress of the Geneva Conference by using the Syngman Rhee clique, which has consistently opposed a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

According to the US Information Agency, a US official source, the US State Department spokesperson officially announced on the 9th: "The United States believes that the agreement it made with the Republic of Korea in 1953 regarding the procedures for the Korean political conference remains valid. The agreement stipulates: if the conference—now scheduled to begin in Geneva on April 26th—fails to achieve its purpose within ninety days, the United States and the Republic of Korea may consider the conference to have ended." At the same time, according to a Reuters reporter in Seoul, South Korean Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai stated that the United States had informally notified South Korea that it could arbitrarily oppose any resolutions made by the majority at the Geneva Conference.

The United States unilaterally setting a ninety-day deadline for the Geneva Conference, attempting to impose the destructive unilateral agreement between the US and Rhee on the Geneva Conference before it even convenes, and allowing Syngman Rhee to obstruct the reaching of agreements at will, clearly does not indicate a preparation to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and to secure stable peace for Korea.

From the day the Berlin Conference announced the agreement to convene the Geneva Conference, the Syngman Rhee clique has constantly threatened to "boycott" the conference, claiming that "relying on negotiations to achieve peace and unification in Korea is impossible to produce any results," and stating that it would never accept any solution that could not guarantee Syngman Rhee's establishment of a fascist dictatorship in all of Korea. At the same time, Syngman Rhee stubbornly insists on turning the Geneva Conference into a "bilateral" meeting in order to facilitate coercion. On the same day that the US State Department announced the ninety-day deadline for the Geneva Conference, Pyun Yung-tai repeated these clamors in Seoul, and shamelessly declared that the Syngman Rhee government would give the Geneva Conference three months, which would be the "absolute limit" for Syngman Rhee to launch a "march north." Now, Washington and Seoul have once again taken coordinated action. Isn't the true intention of the United States to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue obvious?

Since the Berlin Conference, US officials and propaganda agencies have been spreading the atmosphere that the Geneva Conference is bound to fail. It is clear to everyone that the United States fears that the Geneva Conference will reach an agreement conducive to peace. It is using the old methods it employed before the Berlin Conference, which is to attempt to prove that great power consultations cannot solve problems, in order to continue promoting the "Cold War." The United States' unilateral imposition of the ninety-day deadline and its use of Syngman Rhee to sabotage the conference are precisely intended to poison the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference, attempting to turn it into a convenient place for conducting the "Cold War" and to lead the Geneva Conference down the old road of the Korean armistice negotiations and the Panmunjom bilateral talks, characterized by US delays and obstruction. The fact that US officials disregard the world's people's demands for peace, while showing such respect for the Syngman Rhee clique, which is hostile to the Geneva Conference, demonstrates that the United States intends to use Syngman Rhee as a convenient tool at the Geneva Conference to coerce the United States' allies participating in the conference to abandon their own vital interests and positions and to act according to the will of the United States. The ultimate purpose of all these steps can also be found in the speech of Walter S. Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs. Robertson admitted frankly when testifying before a committee of the House of Representatives in late January that the United States wanted to rule the Far East indefinitely and maintain a constant military offensive threat against the People's Republic of China.

This action by the US authorities is, of course, diametrically opposed to the desire of people all over the world for the Geneva Conference to seek peace through consultation.

### 美国当局有意贬低召开日内瓦会议的意义企图利用美李非法协议阻挠会议顺利进行

    美国当局有意贬低召开日内瓦会议的意义企图利用美李非法协议阻挠会议顺利进行
    【新华社十一日讯】　自从柏林四国外长会议结束以后，美国当局在日内瓦会议问题上没有作出任何建设性的努力，最近却有意地贬低召开日内瓦会议的意义，把日内瓦会议——通过大国协商来谋求解决亚洲的迫切问题以缓和国际紧张局势的会议，说成是朝鲜停战协定所规定的朝鲜政治会议的代替，同时并企图利用一贯反对和平解决朝鲜问题的李承晚集团来影响日内瓦会议的顺利召开和进行。
    据美国官方的美国新闻处消息，美国国务院发言人九日正式宣布说：“美国认为它在一九五三年与大韩民国成立的关于朝鲜政治会议程序的协议仍然有效。协议规定：会议——现在预定于四月二十六日在日内瓦开始举行——如在九十天内不能达成会议的目的，美国和大韩民国就可以认为会议已告结束。”同时，据路透社汉城记者报道，李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰表示，美国已非正式通知南朝鲜说，它可以任意反对日内瓦会议上大多数作出的任何决议。
    美国片面地替日内瓦会议规定九十天的期限，企图在会议召开之前就把美李之间破坏性的片面协议强加于日内瓦会议之上，并允许李承晚随心所欲地阻挠达成协议，这显然不是准备在会议上寻求朝鲜问题的和平解决、使朝鲜得到稳定的和平。
    从柏林外长会议宣布关于召开日内瓦会议的协议的一天起，李承晚集团就不断地威胁要“抵制”会议，说什么“依赖通过谈判来达成朝鲜的和平与统一，不可能有任何结果”，并表示决不接受不能保证李承晚在全朝鲜建立法西斯独夫统治的任何解决办法。同时，李承晚还硬要把日内瓦会议变成“双方”的会议，以便于进行要挟。就在美国国务院宣布给日内瓦会议定下九十天限期的同一天，卞荣泰又在汉城重复这些叫嚣，并且厚颜地宣称，李承晚政府将给日内瓦会议以三个月的时间，这将是李承晚发动“向北进军”的“绝对限度”。现在，华盛顿、汉城之间再一次采取了协同行动，美国阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的真实意图难道还不明显么？
    柏林会议以后，美国的官方人士和宣传机构一直在散布日内瓦会议一定要失败的空气。人们都看得出，美国害怕日内瓦会议达成有利于和平的协议，又在使用柏林会议前的老办法，就是企图证明大国协商不能解决问题，以便于继续推行“冷战”。美国现在片面提出了九十天的期限和使用李承晚破坏会议，正是要毒化日内瓦会议的气氛，企图使之成为进行“冷战”的方便场所，并且把日内瓦会议引向以美方的拖延、阻挠为标志的朝鲜停战谈判和板门店双方会谈的老路。美国官方对世界人民的和平要求置之不理，而对敌视日内瓦会议的李承晚集团却如此尊重，正说明美国要把李承晚作成美国在日内瓦会议上的方便工具，用以胁迫参加会议的美国各盟国放弃自己的切身利益和主张，来按照美国的意志办事。所有这些步骤的终极目的，也可以从美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿华·斯·罗伯逊的谈话中找到解答。罗伯逊在一月下旬在众议院一个委员会作证时，就曾直认不讳美国要无限期地统治远东，并对中华人民共和国保持经常的军事进攻的威胁。
    美国当局这种行动当然是和全世界人民要求日内瓦会议协商谋求和平的愿望截然相反的。
