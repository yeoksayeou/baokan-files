    Jiangsu Province Plans to Increase Edible Oil Raw Material Production by Over 100 Million Jin This Year
    Shandong Province Farmers Sell Large Quantities of Peanut Kernels and Oil Raw Materials

    Jiangsu Province plans to increase the planting area of oil crops by more than one million mu this year without affecting grain production, striving to produce more than 100 million jin of edible oil raw materials than last year. Farmers in peanut-producing areas north of the Yangtze River, such as Xuzhou and Huaiyin, are preparing to intercrop peanuts in wheat fields. Many farmers are preparing pesticides to prevent underground pests and will mix them with seeds during sowing to ensure complete peanut emergence. The Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry is guiding farmers in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, Yancheng, and other places to use the scientific method of rhizobium inoculation to strive for increased peanut production. Farmers in many areas will use the open spaces around their homes to plant sunflowers. According to statistics from the Xuzhou area, farmers have retained more than 70,000 jin of sunflower seeds for planting. Oil crops in the southern Yangtze River region of Jiangsu Province are mainly rapeseed. In Suzhou, Songjiang, and other places, farmers planted more than 1.7 million mu of rapeseed last year. After farmers dredged ditches for drainage, cultivated soil, and applied fertilizer, the rapeseed is currently strong, leafy, and growing well.
    Furthermore, as spring plowing approaches, farmers are increasingly selling peanut kernels in exchange for the means of production they need. State-owned commercial departments in Shandong Province are vigorously purchasing in peanut-producing areas according to the needs of farmers. During mid-March, state-owned commercial departments in the Laiyang area purchased an average of more than 600,000 jin of peanut kernels per day, an increase of two times compared to the average daily purchase volume in late February. The purchase volume in other areas such as Linyi, Wendeng, Tai'an, and Jiaozhou has also slightly increased compared to the past. In addition to purchasing peanut kernels and peanut oil, state-owned commercial departments in the province also purchase other oils and oilseeds. In the five days from March 10th to 15th alone, they purchased 187 tons of cottonseed oil and 629 tons of oilseeds such as cottonseed and soybeans.

    江苏省今年计划增产一亿多斤食油原料
    山东省农民大批出售花生仁和油脂原料
    江苏省计划今年在不影响粮食生产的前提下，增加油料作物种植面积一百多万亩，争取比去年多生产一亿多斤食油的原料。长江以北徐州、淮阴等出产花生地区的农民，准备在麦田里间种花生。很多农民准备好防治地下害虫的药剂，在播种时拌种，保证花生出苗齐全。省人民政府农林厅在徐州、淮阴、扬州、盐城等地指导农民使用根瘤菌接种的科学方法，争取花生增产。很多地区的农民将利用住宅前后空地种植向日葵。据徐州地区统计，农民留着种植的向日葵种子有七万多斤。江苏省长江以南地区的油料作物，主要是油菜。在苏州、松江等地，农民去年播种了一百七十多万亩油菜，经过农民开沟排水，培土施肥，目前棵壮叶肥，生长良好。
    又讯：春耕已到来，农民出售花生仁换回所需生产资料的日渐增多。山东省国营商业部门正根据农民的要求，在盛产花生的地区大力进行收购。莱阳专区国营商业部门在三月中旬期间，平均每日购进花生仁达六十多万斤，较二月下旬平均每日购进的数量增加了两倍。其他临沂、文登、泰安、胶州等专区的收购量也都比前略有增加。该省国营商业部门除收购花生仁和花生油外，还收购其它油脂和油料。仅在三月十日到十五日的五天中，就购进棉籽油一百八十七吨，棉籽和大豆等油料六百二十九吨。
