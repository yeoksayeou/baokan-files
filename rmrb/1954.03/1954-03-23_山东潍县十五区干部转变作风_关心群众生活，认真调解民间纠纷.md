    Shandong Weixian Fifteenth District cadres and township cadres, prior to the winter of 1952, had a relatively serious bureaucratic and coercive work style, were indifferent to the suffering of the masses, and ignored disputes among the people. When the masses had problems to appeal or inquire about at the district level, cadres always shirked responsibility or had a very rude attitude towards the masses. Cases were backlogged for a long time, and the district's party and government organs were seriously divorced from the masses. For example, the case of Liu Yujian, a military dependent in Gaoli Village, involving a dispute caused by his daughter-in-law's divorce and taking property, was delayed for half a year. The general reflection of the masses was: "The district head is bureaucratic, asking nothing, caring nothing; the assistant speaks scoldingly, without tact."

    From the winter of 1952 to the spring of 1953, with the help of the Weixian County Party Committee, the district Party committee examined the handling of letters and visits from the people when summarizing their work. Later, they carried out a struggle against bureaucracy. They began to realize the serious harm of bureaucratic work style divorced from the masses and attached importance to the work of mediating civil disputes. After the county Party committee convened a three-level cadre meeting in March of last year, the district Party committee decided: In the future, they should regularly study the work of mediating civil disputes; educate cadres to improve their mass viewpoint; with the deputy district head as the main person responsible, and absorbing civil affairs assistants and clerks to participate, specifically responsible for handling letters and visits from the masses; strengthen education for grassroots cadres, and give play to the role of people's mediation organizations. Because the district Party committee took these specific measures, the ideological work style of the general district cadres has undergone a significant change, so the mediation organizations have been consolidated and improved, and disputes among the masses have begun to be resolved in a timely and correct manner. For example, the village cadres of Huayuan Township always thought that mediating disputes was "meddling in other people's business and getting into trouble," so they did not actively mediate disputes among the masses. After education and assistance from the district Party committee, they realized the importance of mediating disputes among the masses, and later they all actively helped the masses solve problems. Therefore, in more than half a year, the township accepted more than 60 cases, of which 13 required longer to handle due to complex circumstances, while the rest were resolved quickly and properly. The Angu Town Mediation Committee and mediation groups adopted the method of handling small matters individually, general cases within the group, and major matters at the township level. From January to September last year, they mediated 114 disputes, and there emerged a model mediator, Chen Zhichi, who actively mediated disputes for the masses. According to statistics from the district office and Angu Town and Huayuan Township alone, a total of 681 large and small disputes were accepted from January to September last year, all of which were related to the people's production and life. These disputes were sorted and studied, and by October of last year, 507 cases had been fully processed, including 167 land disputes, 198 family disputes, 21 inheritance disputes, 101 marriage issues, and 20 debt issues. Because these disputes were resolved quickly and correctly, not only were the number of cases brought to the court by the masses greatly reduced, but also the unity of the people was strengthened, directly promoting production. The cadres were happy, and the masses were satisfied. The general reflection was: "Chairman Mao leads well, the cadres really handle affairs for us." "The mediation organization does a good job, you don't have to spend money or run around."

    The reasons why the district's mediation of civil disputes achieved such results, in addition to the leadership's attention, the general cadres improved their mass viewpoint, and were able to handle problems in the spirit of being responsible to the people, are as follows: First, cadres and mediators correctly implemented the following policy principles: For those who fight, patiently persuade and advise both sides in the spirit of unity and production, encourage them to exchange opinions, and resolve disputes reasonably. In the case of land disputes, do on-site surveys as much as possible, neighbors comment, everyone discusses, and persuade both parties based on the actual situation and policies and laws. In the case of marriage disputes, mediation and persuasion are carried out according to the principle of harmony and unity being conducive to production; if the relationship between the two parties is indeed bad and difficult to improve, then mediate the divorce. The issue of property in divorce is handled in accordance with the principle of protecting the interests of women and children. General family disputes are resolved by inviting neighbors to mediate together. Division of property is handled according to the principle of one share per person, and the goal is to achieve harmony and unity that is conducive to production. Second, the mass line was implemented in the work. When mediating disputes, cadres or mediators generally explain the policies first, allow the masses to listen in, organize the masses to comment, and carry out persuasion and advice. Sometimes, they also hold forums for interested parties, or village cadres, activists, and people who have close relations with the parties concerned hold meetings together to study, first unify the facts, policies, thoughts, handling opinions, and handling methods, and then carry out mediation separately. Particularly complex cases often involve many people, and this method is easier to solve.

    山东潍县十五区干部转变作风
    关心群众生活，认真调解民间纠纷
    山东潍县十五区的区乡干部，在一九五二年冬季以前有较严重的官僚主义和强迫命令作风，对于群众的疾苦漠不关心，对于群众中的纠纷不问不理。群众有问题到区申诉或询问，干部总是推诿不见，或对群众的态度非常生硬，案件长期积压，区的党政机关严重地脱离了群众。如高里村军属刘玉简因其儿媳离婚要带财产造成纠纷一案，就拖延了半年之久。群众普遍的反映是：“区长官僚主义，不问不管；助理员说话训斥人，没深没浅。”
    一九五二年冬到一九五三年春，经潍县县委帮助，该区区委在总结工作时检查了处理人民来信、来访的工作，以后又进行了反官僚主义的斗争，他们开始认识到脱离群众的官僚主义作风的严重危害性，重视了调处民间纠纷的工作。在去年三月县委召开三级干部会后，该区区委便决定：以后要定期研究调处民间纠纷的工作；要教育干部提高群众观念；以副区长为主，吸收民政助理和文书等参加，具体负责处理群众来信、来访工作；加强对基层干部的教育，发挥人民调解组织的作用。由于区委采取了这些具体措施，一般区干部的思想作风有了显著的转变，所以调解组织得到巩固和提高，群众中的纠纷开始能够获得及时和正确的解决。如花园乡的乡村干部，在以前总认为调处纠纷是“管闲事，落是非”，因而不去积极地调处群众间的纠纷；经过区委的教育和帮助，认识到调解群众纠纷的重要意义，以后就都积极地为群众排难解纷了。因此，在半年多时间内，该乡受理了六十多件案子，其中除十三起因案情复杂、需要较长时间来处理外，其余都得到迅速妥善的解决。安固镇调解委员会和调解小组采用小事个别办、一般案件组内办、大事到乡里办的方法，在去年一月至九月间调处了纠纷一百一十四起，并出现了积极为群众调解纠纷的模范调解员陈之池。仅据区公所及安固镇和花园乡的统计，在去年一月到九月共受理了六百八十一件大小纠纷，都是有关群众生产和生活的问题。这些纠纷经过排队研究，截至去年十月，已全部处理的有五百零七件，其中属于土地纠纷的一百六十七件，家务纠纷的一百九十八件，产业继承的二十一件，婚姻问题的一百零一件，债务问题的二十件。由于这些纠纷得到迅速和正确的处理，不仅大大地减少了群众到法院起诉的案件，而且加强了人民内部的团结，直接推动了生产，干部高兴，群众满意。普遍的反映是：“毛主席领导的好，干部真给办事了。”“调解组织办事好，不用花钱不用跑。”
    该区调处民间纠纷所以获得这样的成绩，除领导重视，一般干部提高了群众观念，能够本着对人民负责的精神去处理问题以外，还有以下几个原因：第一，干部和调解人员正确地贯彻执行了以下的政策原则：凡是打架斗殴的，以团结生产的精神耐心地对双方进行说服劝解，启发他们交换意见，合理解决纠纷。凡是土地纠纷，尽可能作到就地勘察，邻居评论，大家商量，依据实际情况和政策法令说服双方。凡是婚姻纠纷，根据和睦团结有利生产的原则进行调解说服；如双方的关系确属恶劣，不易改善，则调解离婚。对于离婚的带财产问题，是本着保护妇女和子女的利益予以处理。一般家务纠纷，则邀请邻居大家调解；分家是本着一人一份的原则处理，并要达到和睦团结、有利生产的目的。第二，在工作中贯彻了群众路线。在调处纠纷时，一般都是先由干部或调解人员讲明政策，吸收群众旁听，组织群众评论，进行劝解说服。有时还召开关系人座谈会，或由村干部、积极分子以及与当事人关系较密切的人一起开会研究，先将事实真象、政策思想、处理意见和处理方法统一起来，然后分别进行调解。特别复杂的案件，往往关联到很多人，采用这种方法较易解决。
