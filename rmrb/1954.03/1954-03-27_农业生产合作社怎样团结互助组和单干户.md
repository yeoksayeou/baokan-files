How Agricultural Production Cooperatives Unite Mutual Aid Teams and Individual Farmers
Deng Wenchou, Ou Haibin

Once agricultural production cooperatives are established, are mutual aid teams no longer important? If mutual aid and cooperation is the only bright path for farmers, does that mean the Party no longer cares about individual farmers? Neither is true. The Communist Party's policy is naturally to guide farmers onto the bright path of agricultural collectivization, but this is a path that must be taken step by step. It is impossible to jump directly to the desired destination in one giant leap. It is not only impossible for all farmers to join agricultural production cooperatives all at once, it is also impossible for all farmers to join mutual aid teams all at once. There are still many individual farmers in the country. As long as there is one laboring farmer who has not yet joined an agricultural production cooperative or mutual aid team, cadres and organized farmers must continue to help them, unite them, and persuade them to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. For mutual aid teams, it is also necessary to continuously help them develop and improve, step by step. If mutual aid teams are well-managed, it will be easier to further develop agricultural production cooperatives. The more mutual aid teams are developed and the better they are managed, the easier it will be to develop agricultural production cooperatives in the future. Therefore, it is precisely in order to better develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement that it is even more necessary to continuously care for individual farmers; it is precisely in order to develop more agricultural production cooperatives that it is even more necessary to effectively manage mutual aid teams.

Everyone says, "Agricultural production cooperatives are the locomotives of the mutual aid and cooperation movement," and that is absolutely correct. While leading agricultural production cooperatives, the Party and the government must continue to pay attention to leading mutual aid teams and individual farmers; agricultural production cooperatives should also play the role of "locomotive," leading mutual aid teams and individual farmers to advance together, on the one hand, increasing agricultural production and using the strength of all farmers to support national industrialization; on the other hand, strengthening the internal unity of farmers and using the strength of all farmers to fight against the capitalist exploitation of rich peasants, usurers, and speculators.

From what aspects to help and unite mutual aid teams and individual farmers

What kind of help should agricultural production cooperatives give to mutual aid teams and individual farmers?

First of all, agricultural production cooperatives should help non-cooperative masses in establishing mutual aid teams, formulating production plans, evaluating work points, and so on. Generally speaking, cooperatives have more experience in these areas than teams, and most cooperatives are transformed from better teams. Cadres in the cooperative should help individual farmers organize mutual aid teams, and often care about the surrounding mutual aid teams, understand the situation in the teams, and help them solve problems when they encounter difficulties. For example, the Pu Zhongzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangmang Village, Chang'an, Shaanxi, helped the nearby mutual aid teams solve the problem of the order of work in 1953, and taught them the good methods they used when they were still mutual aid teams. As a result, many mutual aid teams that had collapsed in the nearby area were restored and persisted. Some agricultural production cooperatives send their accountants to help mutual aid teams with bookkeeping, which is also of great help to mutual aid teams.

Agricultural production cooperatives should also help mutual aid teams and individual farmers in terms of production technology. Generally speaking, cooperatives have more experience in this area than mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and the conditions for experimenting with and improving technology are much stronger. If the cooperative succeeds in improving technology, it can be passed on to the nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers; with the example of cooperatives improving technology and increasing production, it is easier for everyone to accept new technologies.

Agricultural production cooperatives can also unite and help mutual aid teams and individual farmers in terms of agricultural infrastructure construction. If agricultural production cooperatives have surplus labor, they can use the method of equivalent exchange to help mutual aid teams and individual farmers carry out some basic construction. Especially when the cooperative is building larger water conservancy projects or using existing water conservancy, or when repairing terraced fields or reclaiming tidal flats, because everyone's land is interlaced, it will inevitably involve mutual aid teams and individual farmers. In such matters, agricultural production cooperatives must not infringe on the interests of farmers outside the cooperative, and should provide as much convenience and assistance as possible to farmers outside the cooperative. If mutual aid teams and individual farmers can be united to work together, these things can be done more smoothly, which is also beneficial to the cooperative.

When non-cooperative masses encounter difficulties in production and life, agricultural production cooperatives should provide assistance as much as possible depending on their conditions. For example, if some mutual aid teams and poor households lack livestock and farm tools, the cooperative's livestock and farm tools have surplus capacity, they can be supplied to mutual aid teams and poor households for use through equivalent exchange. Generally speaking, the lives of cooperative members are better; when non-cooperative masses encounter difficulties in life, cooperative members should give play to the spirit of class friendship and help them avoid exploitation by rich peasants and usurers. In this way, they will support the cooperative, help the cooperative, participate in the cooperative, and strengthen the strength of the cooperative. Generally speaking, the cooperative's farm work is completed earlier; in the case of needing to rush to harvest and plant, and the agricultural production cooperative has surplus capacity, it can also provide appropriate assistance to mutual aid teams and individual farmers through equivalent exchange; of course, in the case of the cooperative needing to rush to harvest and plant, and the non-cooperative masses have surplus capacity, it can also absorb non-cooperative labor to work, giving them fair and reasonable remuneration.

All these things must be done on the principle that both parties benefit, and must not form exploitation or coercion of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, nor can the cooperative suffer losses, the cooperative's strength is too scattered, and cooperative members are dissatisfied. Cadres and cooperative members must understand that as long as this is done, it will be beneficial to both inside and outside the cooperative, and it will also be beneficial to the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement.

In addition to this, agricultural production cooperatives should also help mutual aid teams and individual farmers in terms of political and ideological education. Generally speaking, the ideology of cadres and cooperative members is more advanced; they should help the surrounding farmers to progress in daily life and in various political movements, using practical actions and persuasive methods, so that they understand the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation, the benefits of taking the socialist road, and the benefits of supporting national industrialization.

What methods to use to help and unite mutual aid teams and individual farmers

What methods do agricultural production cooperatives use to help and unite non-cooperative masses?

The first important thing is to run the cooperative well and show a good example to everyone. The cooperative should give full play to the advantages of the agricultural production cooperative itself, increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, and increase the actual income of cooperative members; cooperative members should care about the cooperative's affairs, give play to their labor enthusiasm, and conscientiously follow the various systems that have been discussed and stipulated by everyone. In this way, the non-cooperative masses can see that the agricultural production cooperative is not messing around, but is really working hard to increase production, and the rules and systems of the cooperative are really reasonable, and the cooperative members are loving, harmonious and united, and running the cooperative is really for the benefit of all farmers. Paving a road and figuring out a set of experiences is the greatest help to non-cooperative masses; and only by running the cooperative well can we talk about uniting the non-cooperative masses.

When the cooperative is well-managed, the farm work is done well, the crops grow well, the cooperative harvests a lot of grain, and cooperative members receive a lot of income, it can invite non-cooperative masses from this village and nearby villages to visit the cooperative. In the process of their visit, the cooperative can use living facts to help them solve ideological problems, eliminate the knots in their hearts about taking the socialist road; it can also use living examples to help them learn to improve farming techniques, and spread the good methods of increasing grain production to the masses.

The cooperative's meetings to discuss various systems, the general meeting to distribute income, the group meetings to study technology, etc., can all absorb representatives from mutual aid teams and individual farmers to participate. Cooperative cadres should also introduce their experiences to everyone on various appropriate occasions (such as in training classes held by counties and districts, people's congresses of districts and townships, etc.). Cooperative members should also use the relationship of relatives, friends and neighbors to publicize and explain the benefits and methods of the cooperative to people outside the cooperative. When mutual aid teams and other villages ask cooperative cadres to report on cooperative experience and high-yield experience, the cooperative cadres should also seriously prepare and enthusiastically accept the invitation. When non-cooperative masses ask the cooperative's technicians and accountants for help, the cooperative should also provide assistance as much as possible.

Some places take the best agricultural production cooperative in the local area as the center, and connect the surrounding agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to form a "cooperative mutual aid network," stipulating that they exchange and disseminate the experience of cooperative mutual aid at regular intervals; some also invite experienced old farmers with high-yield experience to participate, forming a technology promotion network, and uniting some individual farmers. This is also a good way for agricultural production cooperatives to help and unite non-cooperative masses, and it can be tried in places where there are better-managed and longer-established cooperatives.

Pay attention to uniting non-cooperative masses in the process of building a cooperative

Agricultural production cooperatives are generally developed on the basis of mutual aid teams. Some are formed by taking a stronger mutual aid team as the center, absorbing some weaker mutual aid teams and individual farmers; others are formed by the union of several mutual aid teams. When building a cooperative, a small number of the original mutual aid team members may be unwilling to join the cooperative because their ideology has not yet been clarified. The cooperative must not attack these team members, and should still help them wholeheartedly. If they are still unwilling to join the cooperative after patient persuasion, they should be helped to organize new mutual aid teams or join other mutual aid teams; if there is public property in the original mutual aid team, they should be returned their due share (things that are not easy to separate can be converted into money and returned to them).

When building a cooperative, we must also pay attention to not only seeing the needs of the cooperative and emptying the backbone of many mutual aid teams in a village. When a mutual aid team cannot achieve full or most of the people joining the cooperative, cooperative cadres and the village branch should persuade some backbone members to remain in the mutual aid team and continue to run the mutual aid team well, prepare for the conditions for running a cooperative, and strive for the entire team to join the cooperative in the future. These backbone members should understand that doing so is beneficial to the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement, and beneficial to the Party's cause; they should happily continue to stay in the team, on the one hand, run the mutual aid team better, and on the other hand, do their best to help with the work of building the cooperative, and strengthen the unity of the cooperative and the team.

When building a cooperative and expanding an old cooperative, we must also pay attention to not excluding any laboring farmers, especially not excluding poor households, nor excluding farmers who have withdrawn from the cooperative or who withdrew from the mutual aid team when the mutual aid team was transferred to the cooperative in the past. In peacetime, we should help them as much as possible; when they ask to join the cooperative, we should warmly welcome them. Some cooperatives deliberately increase the amount of investment when building a cooperative, and adopt the method of averaging the apportionment according to labor, which in practice excludes poor households from joining the cooperative, which is inappropriate.

Some mutual aid teams do not have mature conditions for running a cooperative, some have insufficient backbone capacity, and some have insufficient mass awareness; but the activists in the team are eager to run a cooperative. County and district work cadres should encourage and help them continue to work hard to create conditions, and also absorb their representatives to participate in appropriate meetings in the process of building other cooperatives, improve their ability and awareness, and strive to build a cooperative smoothly in the future. The backbone and activists who are building a cooperative should also unite well with the backbone and activists of the mutual aid teams that are not yet building a cooperative.

In short, from the time of its establishment, an agricultural production cooperative must establish a close, friendly and mutually helpful relationship with the non-cooperative masses. If the cooperative is isolated, it will not only not benefit the mutual aid teams and individual farmers, but also be detrimental to the cooperative itself. If the cooperative is made the core of uniting mutual aid teams and individual farmers, attracting non-cooperative masses around the cooperative like a magnet attracts iron, it will not only benefit the cooperative, but also better increase agricultural production, support national industrialization, and lead all farmers on the socialist road.

    农业生产合作社怎样团结互助组和单干户
    邓文畴　欧海滨
    办了农业生产合作社，互助组是不是就不重要了？说互助合作是农民的唯一的光明大路，那么，是不是党就不再关心单干农民了？都不是的。共产党的政策自然是要引导农民走农业合作化的光明大道，可是，这条大道是要一步一步走的，不可能一大步就跨到想要走到的地方去。不但要全体农民一下子都参加农业生产合作社是办不到的；就是要全体农民一下子都参加互助组也是办不到的。现在全国的单干农民还有很多。只要有一户劳动农民还没有参加农业生产合作社和互助组，干部和已经组织起来的农民就还要继续帮助他们，团结他们，说服他们走互助合作的道路。对于互助组，也要不断地帮助它们发展和改进，一步步提高。互助组办好了，进一步发展农业生产合作社就比较好办了。互助组发展得越多，办得越好，以后发展农业生产合作社也越好办。所以，正是为了更好地发展互助合作运动，才更需要不断地关心单干户；正是为了更多地发展农业生产合作社，才更需要切实地办好互助组。
    大家说：“农业生产合作社是互助合作运动的火车头”，这句话一点也不错。党和政府在领导农业生产合作社的同时要继续不断地注意领导互助组和单干户；农业生产合作社也应当发挥“火车头”的作用，带动互助组和单干户一同前进，一方面提高农业生产，用全体农民的力量支援国家工业化；一方面加强农民内部的团结，用全体农民的力量和富农、高利贷主、投机商人的资本主义剥削作斗争。
    从哪些方面帮助、团结互助组和单干户
    农业生产合作社应该给互助组和单干户一些什么帮助呢？
    首先，农业生产合作社要在建立互助组、订生产计划、评工记分等等方面帮助社外群众。一般地说，社比组在这些方面的经验是比较多的，大部分社都是由比较好的组转成社的。社里的干部应当帮助单干农民组织互助组，并且经常关心周围的互助组，了解组里的情况，互助组里发生了困难就帮助他们解决。像陕西长安王莽村蒲忠智农业生产合作社在一九五三年帮助附近的互助组解决了做活先后的问题，把他们原来还是互助组的时候采用的好方法传授给各个互助组，附近地方就有许多本来垮台了的互助组恢复起来而且一直坚持下来了。有的农业生产合作社派自己的会计帮互助组算账，对互助组也有很大帮助。
    农业生产合作社还要在生产技术方面帮助互助组和单干户。社在这方面的经验，一般地说也比互助组和单干户的经验多，试验改进技术的条件也比互助组和单干户强得多。社里改进技术成功了，就可以传授给附近的互助组和单干户；有合作社改进技术增产了的活榜样，大家也就比较容易接受新的技术了。
    农业生产合作社在农业基本建设方面也可以团结和帮助互助组和单干户。农业生产合作社如果有用不完的劳动力，可以用等价交换的办法帮助互助组、单干户进行一些基本建设。特别是在社里兴修比较大的水利或者使用已有的水利的时候，或者修梯田、淤滩地的时候，因为大家的土地都交错着，势必会牵涉到互助组和单干户。在这样的事情上，农业生产合作社决不可侵犯社外农民的利益，还要尽可能给社外农民以方便和帮助。能团结互助组和单干户一起干，这些事情就能做得更顺利，对合作社也是有好处的。
    农业生产合作社在社外群众生产上、生活上碰到困难的时候，应该看自己的条件尽可能地给以帮助。譬如，有些互助组和困难户缺少牲口、农具，社里的牲口、农具有多余的力量，可以用等价交换的办法供给互助组和困难户使用。一般地说，社员的生活是比较好的；在社外群众生活上碰到困难的时候，社员们应该发挥阶级友爱的精神，帮助他们免受富农、高利贷主的剥削。这样，他们就会拥护合作社，帮助合作社，参加合作社，壮大合作社的力量。一般地说，社里的农活是做完的比较早的；在需要赶时间抢收、抢种而农业生产合作社又有余力的情况下，也可以用等价交换的办法给互助组、单干户以适当的帮助；当然，在社里需要抢收抢种而社外群众有余力的情况下，也可以吸收社外劳动力做活，给他们公平合理的报酬。
    以上这些事情，一定要在双方都有好处的原则下来做，决不可形成对互助组和单干户的剥削或强迫，也不可使合作社吃亏，使社的力量过于分散，使社员们不满。社内干部和社员群众都要明白，只要这样做，对社内社外就都会有好处，对整个互助合作运动也是有好处的。
    除此以外，农业生产合作社在政治思想教育方面也要帮助互助组和单干农民。一般地说，社内干部和社员们的思想是比较先进的；应当在日常生活中和各种政治运动中，用实际行动和说服的方法帮助周围的农民群众进步，使他们了解互助合作、走社会主义道路的好处，了解支援国家工业化的好处。
    用什么方法帮助、团结互助组和单干户
    农业生产合作社用些什么办法来帮助和团结社外群众呢？
    头一条要紧事就是把社办好，摆出活样子给大家看。合作社要充分地发挥农业生产合作社本身的优越性，增产粮食和别的农产品，增加社员们的实际收入；社员们都要关心社里的事情，发挥劳动积极性，认真地照着经过大家讨论规定出来的各种制度办事。这样，就可以让社外的群众看到农业生产合作社不是瞎胡闹，真是正正经经为增加生产努力的，社里的规矩、制度也真正是合情合理的，社员之间都是相亲相爱、和睦团结的，办合作社确实是为着全体农民的利益。踩出一条道路来，摸出一套经验来，这就是对社外群众的最大的帮助；也只有把社办好了，才能谈得上团结社外的群众。
    社办好了，农活干得好，庄稼长得好，社里粮食打得多，社员收益分得多，就可以邀请本村和附近村子的社外群众到社里参观。在他们参观的过程中，合作社就可以用活的事实帮助他们解决思想问题，消除他们心上对于走社会主义道路的疙瘩；还可以用活的样子帮助他们学习改进耕作技术，把多打粮食的好办法传播到广大群众中去。
    合作社里讨论各种制度的会议，分配收益的大会，研究技术的小组会等等，都可以吸收互助组的代表和单干农民参加。合作社的干部也应当在各种适当的场合（如在县区举办的训练班里、区乡人民代表大会上等等），向大家介绍自己的经验。社员们也应当利用亲戚朋友邻居的关系，把合作社的好处和办法多多向社外的人们宣传、解释。互助组和别的村子请合作社的干部去报告办社经验、丰产经验的时候，社的干部也应该认真地作好准备，热心地接受邀请。社外群众要求社里的技术员、会计员帮助的时候，社里也应该尽可能地给以帮助。
    有些地方以当地最好的农业生产合作社为中心，把周围的农业生产合作社、互助组都联系起来，组成“合作互助网”，规定一定时间互相交流、传播合作互助的经验；有的还邀请有丰产经验的老农参加，组成技术推广网，把一些单干农民也团结起来。这也是农业生产合作社帮助和团结社外群众的好办法，在有办得较好、历史较长的社的地方可以试行。
    在建社过程中就要注意团结社外群众
    农业生产合作社一般是在互助组的基础上发展起来的。有的是以一个较强的互助组做中心，吸收了别的一些较弱的互助组和个别单干户组成的；有的是几个互助组联合组成的。在建社的时候，有少数原来的互助组员可能因为思想还没有打通不愿入社。对于这一部分组员，合作社决不可打击他们，对他们仍然要热心帮助。如果经过耐心的说服他们仍然不愿入社，应该帮助他们组织新的互助组或者加入别的互助组；如果原来的互助组内有公共财产，应当退给他们应得的一份（不好分开的东西，可以折合成钱退给他们）。
    在建社的时候，也不能光看到社的需要，把一个村子里的许多互助组的骨干都抽空。在一个互助组还不能做到全部或大部分人入社的时候，办社干部和村支部要劝说一部分骨干分子仍然留在互助组内，把互助组继续办好，准备好办社的条件，争取将来全组入社。这些骨干分子应当了解，这样做是对整个互助合作运动有利的，对党的事业有利的；应该愉快地继续留在组内，一方面把互助组办得更好，一方面尽力帮助办社工作，加强社和组的团结。
    在建社和扩大老社的时候，还要注意不要排斥任何一个劳动农民，特别是不要排斥困难户，也不要排斥曾经退社或者过去互助组转社的时候从互助组里退出去的农民。在平时，应当尽可能地帮助他们；在他们要求入社的时候，应当热烈地欢迎他们。有些社在建社时故意加大投资的数目，而且采取按劳动力平均摊派的办法，这样实际上也就是排斥困难户入社，是不妥当的。
    有些互助组办社的条件还不成熟，有的是骨干能力不够，有的是群众觉悟不够；可是组内积极分子却迫切要求办社。县区工作干部应该鼓励和帮助他们继续努力创造条件，在别的合作社建社的过程中也吸收他们的代表参加适当的会议，提高他们的能力和觉悟，争取将来顺利地建社。正在建社的骨干和积极分子也应当很好地团结还不建社的互助组的骨干和积极分子。
    总之，农业生产合作社从成立的时候起，就要和社外群众建立起亲密友爱相互帮助的关系。如果把合作社孤立起来，不但对互助组、单干农民没有好处，对合作社本身也是不利的。如果使合作社成为团结互助组和单干农民的核心，像磁石吸铁一样把社外群众都吸引在合作社周围，不但对合作社有好处，而且能够更好地增加农业生产、支援国家工业化，带领全体农民走社会主义的路。
