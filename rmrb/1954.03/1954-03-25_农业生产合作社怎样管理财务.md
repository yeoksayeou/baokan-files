    How Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Manage Finances
    Shi Linqi
    With so many families together in agricultural production cooperatives, making production investments, handling money, recording work points, and distributing grain and money, won't things get chaotic? If everyone is busy all year and it turns into a muddle, what should be done?
    In the past, when individual households were operating separately, there was generally only "a mental ledger," and "either way the meat rots in the pot." Whether to keep accounts or not, whether to calculate or not, it didn't matter. When mutual aid teams were organized, simple records of exchange labor were kept, and even work tickets without ledgers were acceptable. When agricultural production cooperatives were established, in the beginning, both the members and the cadres of the cooperatives were just transitioning from separate operation to unified operation. It was easy to overlook financial management work, and there was no experience in managing the "big family affairs" of many households together. This indeed easily led to chaos. For example: only production plans were made, without calculating how much investment was needed, or how to rationally expand production investment. Therefore, it was easy to invest blindly without calculating costs, or not to expand investment. Some cooperatives did not calculate income and expenditure, and spent money casually; or necessary expenses were not made. Some cooperatives had chaotic accounts, unclear procedures, and even embezzlement occurred. All of these hindered the cooperative's production, and in serious cases could even cause the cooperative to collapse. How can these phenomena be avoided? The most important thing is to strengthen financial management.
    Based on the current situation of agricultural production cooperatives, financial work mainly includes the following aspects: First, formulating and mastering the cooperative's financial plan: First, a full-year income and expenditure budget should be prepared, which means calculating how much income and expenditure there will be throughout the year at the beginning of the year, to ensure the rational use of the cooperative's funds, and to give members a clear idea of how much income can be expected in a year; then, a relatively detailed quarterly income and expenditure budget should be made on a quarterly basis, and the use of funds should be controlled according to the actual situation; Second, establishing a strict accounting system: recording income and expenditure accounts and labor accounts clearly, handling income and expenditure procedures properly, settling accounts on time, publicizing accounts, and calculating the distribution of the cooperative's income; Third, establishing a system for purchasing and managing the cooperative's public property. Each of these things is closely related to the vital interests of the members.
    Financial work should serve production
    How to strengthen financial management?
    First of all, financial work must be planned. When making financial plans, it is necessary to closely combine them with production plans, serve production, and ensure the realization of production plans. For example, if the production plan stipulates that more fertilizer should be applied, then the financial plan should calculate how much the cooperative's fertilizer expenditure will be. If the cooperative's financial resources are not sufficient, then the results of the calculation should be told to the management committee, so that the management committee can think of other ways, mobilize members to open up fertilizer sources from various aspects, accumulate more fertilizer, pay attention to fertilizer accumulation technology, and improve fertilizer quality, to replace the purchase of fine fertilizer. For example, if the production plan stipulates that deep plowing should be carried out universally, this requires relatively large and strong draft animals. Then, when making the financial plan, it is necessary to accurately calculate how much the expenditure on draft animals will be, whether the cooperative's financial resources can afford it, how to reduce the expenditure on draft animals and ensure universal deep plowing, and ensure that there is enough animal power, etc. When making financial plans, it is necessary to think about increasing production and increasing income, and to think more about ways to increase production in order to increase income. At the same time, it is necessary to try to save, tighten, and reduce expenses that are not related to production or have little relation to production, and rationally use financial and material resources more on expanding production. In terms of expenditure, on the one hand, it is necessary to base it on the actual needs of production, and on the other hand, it is necessary to base it on the cooperative's financial conditions and income situation, to distinguish between those expenditures that are necessary, those that can be reduced, those that do not need to be made temporarily, and those that do not need to be made at all. In this way, we can correctly save expenses, avoid random expenses and excessive expenses, and also avoid the phenomenon of not making expenses that should be made, causing losses to production.
    Keeping clear labor accounts is also a very important part of financial work. This is also closely related to whether production is done well or badly, and it is even more directly related to the vital interests of each member. If the members' daily labor accounts are not recorded clearly and errors occur, it is easy to cause disputes and hinder the members' labor enthusiasm; it will be even more difficult to distribute at the time of distribution. Therefore, the cooperative must carefully and carefully record and calculate the labor accounts of the members, to ensure that there are no errors, and if there are errors, they should be corrected quickly. At present, the general practice adopted by cooperatives is that the team leader or work recorder of the labor team records work points and issues work tickets every day, and the cooperative's accountant settles accounts and clears work points with the team leader or work recorder regularly, and records them in the general ledger. Some teams have the team leader report the accounts and record work points to the accountant every day, and each member has their own labor account, recording their own labor points assessed by the team every day, and then checking them at the end of the month and recording them in the general ledger. The Wuhou Li Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, created a "Work Reporting Form." The team reports work tickets to the accountant every ten days in normal times, and every five days during the busy farming season; after the accountant registers according to the "Work Reporting Form," he gives the team's work recorder a two-part form, one part stays with the team, and one part is given to the member himself. The work accounts are settled once a month. In addition to announcing the number of labor days of each member at the general meeting of members, it is also posted on the list in the form of an "Increase and Decrease Chart." This has a great effect on encouraging members' labor enthusiasm; at the same time, it can also check in time whether there are any errors in the accounting.
    It should be simple and easy to implement, clear and not chaotic
    The method of keeping accounts should be simple and easy to implement. When some cooperatives were first established, some recorded all the accounts in one book, and some left various income and expenditure receipts without entering them into the accounts at all, and as a result, they could not settle the accounts. Therefore, improving the accounting method is very important. At present, there is no unified account subject in each cooperative. According to the current conditions of agricultural production cooperatives, if it is too complicated, it is not easy to implement because of the limitations of cultural level and experience; if it is too simple, it is not suitable for collective production and unified management. It should be based on the principle of simplicity, ease of implementation, clarity and non-chaos, and the account subjects should be formulated according to the specific conditions of each cooperative. Generally, the accounts can be divided into two types: "Daily Journal" (that is, "Flowing Account") and "Classification Account" (that is, "Base Account"). The daily journal is to record each income and expenditure item by day and in order. Just having a daily journal does not make it clear how much property the cooperative has, what debts it owes to the outside, how the income and expenditure of agricultural and sideline production is, etc., so there must also be a classification account, which is to "pass" each income and expenditure item on the daily journal to the account of that category. How many categories the classification account should be divided into, how many subcategories (that is, "subjects") should be divided under each category, and how many account books should be used, should be decided according to the actual needs of each cooperative.
    Someone should be responsible, and everyone should supervise
    Financial work must be the responsibility of a dedicated person. General cooperatives have an accountant who is in charge of financial work under the leadership of the management committee. Some larger cooperatives have a financial section under the management committee, which is in charge of all the financial affairs of the cooperative, with accountants, cashiers, and custodians, each with one person in charge. The person in charge of financial work must be carefully selected, and everyone recognizes that he is selfless, good at careful calculation, not afraid of trouble, and careful and patient in his work. Because they have to participate less in the cooperative's field labor to do this work, their labor days should also be recorded reasonably and fairly for this work.
    In order to make the financial work orderly, it is also necessary to establish a unified income and expenditure system. The income and expenditure budget should be proposed by the management committee, submitted to the general meeting of members (or the meeting of members' representatives) for discussion and approval, and then handed over to the management committee for implementation. General accounts should be cleared daily and settled monthly, and the income and expenditure situation should be reported to the general meeting of members regularly, and summarized and announced at the end of the year. Daily expenses that are within the budget should be approved by the president (director) or the cooperative affairs committee; those outside the budget and of a large amount should be discussed and approved by the general meeting of members (or the meeting of members' representatives). Income and expenditure must have clear procedures, receipts must be issued for income, and vouchers must be available for spending money. With a unified income and expenditure system, we can prevent the phenomenon of arbitrary misappropriation, borrowing, random expenses, and even embezzlement and waste.
    All public property of the cooperative must be under the charge of a dedicated person; taking and using it must be registered, unused items must be returned to the warehouse, damaged items must be repaired, and lost items must be compensated.
    All members of the cooperative should also implement democratic supervision of financial work. How to implement democratic supervision? First, the management committee should publish the accounts regularly, so that members have a clear understanding of the cooperative's financial situation; second, the management committee should regularly study financial work and mobilize members to inspect and make suggestions, or elect representatives to inspect financial work; cooperatives with a supervisory committee should have the supervisory committee inspect financial work regularly and report the inspection results to the general meeting of members (or the meeting of members' representatives). Every member should recognize the importance of financial work, take a responsible attitude as masters, and supervise the cooperative's financial work according to these methods. As long as everyone takes responsibility, the cooperative's "big family affairs" will not be chaotic. Doing financial work well will have a great effect on improving production and increasing income.

    农业生产合作社怎样管理财务 
    史林琪
    农业生产合作社里，那么多家在一起，生产投资，钱财出入，计工记工，分粮分钱，不会弄乱吗？大家一年忙到头，如果弄成一篇糊涂账，可该怎么办？
    过去一家一户分散经营的时候，一般都是只有
  “一本心账”，“反正肉烂了在锅里”，记账不记账，算账不算账，无所谓。组织了互助组，也只是简单地记一记换工账，只有工票没有账本也可以。建立了农业生产合作社，开头的一个时候，社员们和社里的干部们都是才从分散经营转到统一经营，很容易忽视财务管理工作，也没有统一经营许多家合在一起的“大家务”的经验。这样，确实很容易发生混乱现象。比如：只订生产计划，而不计算投资多少，不计算怎样合理地扩大生产投资。因此，往往容易不计算成本、盲目投资，或者是不扩大投资。有的社收入支出都不计算，随便开支；或者是必要的应当开支的也不开支。有的社账目混乱，手续不清，甚至发生贪污现象。这些都会妨碍社里的生产，严重的还可能使社垮台。怎样避免发生这些现象呢？最要紧的一件事就是加强财务管理。
    根据目前农业生产合作社的情况看，财务工作主要包括这几个方面：一、制订和掌握全社的财务计划：首先要编制全年的收支预算，就是在一年开头的时候把全年能收入多少、要支出多少计算一下，保证合理地使用社里的资金，并且使社员们对于一年能有多大收入心中有数；然后要按季订出比较周密的每季的收支预算，按实际情况掌握资金的使用；二、建立严格的会计制度：记清收支来往账目和劳动工账，办好收支手续，按时结算账目，公布账目，计算全社收益的分配；三、建立采买和保管社里公共财物的制度。这些事情，每一件都是和社员的切身利益密切相关的。
    财务工作要为生产服务
    怎样加强财务管理呢？
    首先，财务工作要有计划。订财务计划的时候，一定要和生产计划密切结合，为生产服务，保证生产计划的实现。比如生产计划内规定，要多施肥料，那么财务计划就要计算全社肥料开支需要多少。如果社的财力不够，那么就要把计算的结果告诉管理委员会，让管理委员会另想办法，发动社员从多方面开辟肥源，多多积肥，讲究积肥技术，提高肥料质量，以代替购买细肥。又比如生产计划内规定了要普遍进行深耕，这就需要比较大的和强的耕畜。那么，订财务计划的时候就要精密计算耕畜方面的开支需要多少，社的财力能否负担得起，怎样能够减少耕畜方面的开支而又能保证普遍深耕，保证畜力够用，等等。订财务计划的时候，必须为增加生产、增加收入着想，要多想提高生产的门路，以增加收入。同时，要尽量节省、紧缩和生产没有关系或关系较小的开支，把财力物力合理地多用在扩大生产上面。在开支上，一方面要根据生产的实际需要，一方面要根据社内的财力条件和收入情况，去分别那些是必要的开支，那些是可以减少的开支；那些是暂时不需要开支的，那些是根本不需要开支的。这样，才能正确地节省开支，避免乱开支和开支太大的现象，也可以避免该开支而不开支使生产受到损失的现象。
    记清劳动工账，也是财务工作中的很重要的一桩事。这和生产搞得好坏也是有很密切的关系的，和每个社员的切身利益更是有直接关系的。如果对社员平日的劳动工账记不清楚，发生差错，那就容易引起纠纷，妨碍社员们的劳动积极性；到分配时，更会发生很大的困难。因此，社里一定要把社员的劳动工账认真、仔细地记好算好，保证不出差错，有了差错也要做到能够很快对正。目前一般社采取的办法是由劳动小组的组长或记工员按天记工发工票，社的会计定期和组长或记工员结账清工，记到总账上。也有的是小组长每天向会计报账记工，社员每人有自己的劳动工账，每天把组内评定的自己的劳动工记上，到月底对正，记到总账上。山西省平顺县武侯梨农林畜牧生产合作社，创造了一种“报工表”，小组平常十天向会计报一次工票，农忙季节五天报一次工票；会计根据“报工表”登记后，给小组记工员一张两联单，一联留在小组，一联给社员本人。工账每月结算一次。除在社员大会上宣布各个社员劳动工数外，并且用“升降表”的形式贴榜公布。这对鼓励社员劳动积极性有很大作用；同时也可以及时检查记账有没有错误。
    要简便易行，清楚不乱
    记账的方法要简明易行。有些社刚成立的时候，有的是把所有的账都记在一个本子上，有的是留下各种收支单据，根本不上账，结果都没法结账。因此，改进记账方法是很重要的。现在各社都还没有统一的账簿科目。根据现在农业生产合作社的条件，太复杂了，因为受文化水平和经验的限制，不容易行得通；太简单了，又不适合集体生产、统一经营的需要。应以简便易行、清楚不乱为原则，根据各社具体条件，制定账簿科目。一般地可以把账簿分成“日记账”（就是“流水账”）、“分类账”
  （就是“底账”）两种。日记账，是把各项收支按天按次序一笔一笔地记下来。光有日记账，还看不清社里到底有多大家业，欠外边一些什么账，农副业生产上的开支、收入怎么样等等，所以还要有分类账，就是把日记账上的每一笔收支按它是那一类就“过”到那一类账上去。分类账要分几类，几类下面又要分几个小类（就是“科目”），要用几本账，却要看各社的实际需要来决定。
    要专人负责，大家监督
    财务工作必须要有专人负责。一般的社都有一个会计人员，在管理委员会领导下专管财务工作。也有的比较大的社，在管理委员会下，设立财务股，总管社里的一切财务，内设会计、出纳、保管等人员，各有一人负专责。负责财务工作的人，一定要经过慎重选择，大家公认他大公无私，善于精打细算，不怕麻烦，工作细心耐心。他们为做这些工作要少参加社里的田间劳动，因此应该给他们的这些工作也合理地公平地记上劳动日。
    为了使财务工作有条有理，还要建立统一的收支制度。收支预算要由管理委员会提出，交给社员大会（或社员代表大会）讨论通过，然后交给管理委员会照办。一般的账目应做到日清、月结，定期把收支情况向社员大会做报告，年末总结公布。日常开支，是预算以内的，应当由社长（主任）或社务委员会批准；预算以外的，数目较大的，应经社员大会（或社员代表大会）讨论批准。收支来往一定要手续清楚，收入要开收条，用钱要有单据。这样有了统一的收支制度，就可以防止随意挪用、借用、乱开支以至贪污浪费的现象发生。
    社里所有的公共财物都要有专人负责保管；取用要登记，不用要归库，损坏要修理，遗失要赔偿。
    全体社员对财务工作还要实行民主监督，怎样实行民主监督呢？首先管理委员会要定期公布账目，使社员对全社的财务情况心里有底；其次，管理委员会要定期专门研究财务工作，并且发动社员检查，提意见，或由社员选举代表检查财务工作；设有监察委员会的社，由监察委员会定期检查财务工作，并且把检查结果向社员大会（或社员代表大会）报告。每个社员都要认清财务工作的重要，用主人翁的态度，按照这些办法来监督社里的财务工作。只要大家都负起责任来，社里的“大家务”是不会弄乱的。财务工作做好了，对于提高生产，增加收入是会有很大作用的。
