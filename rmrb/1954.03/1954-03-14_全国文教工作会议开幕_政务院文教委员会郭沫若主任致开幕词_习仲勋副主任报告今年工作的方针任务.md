Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The National Conference on Cultural and Educational Work began in Beijing on the afternoon of the 12th.

The central agenda of this conference is to discuss and determine the guiding principles and tasks for cultural and educational work in 1954, as well as the cultural and educational development plan for 1954 and the main indicators for the Five-Year Cultural and Educational Construction, based on the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, and after summarizing the cultural and educational work in 1953.

Guo Moruo, Director of the Government Administration Council's Committee on Cultural and Educational Affairs, pointed out in his opening speech that our country has entered a new historical period of transition from new democracy to socialism. Our cultural and educational work must closely follow the progress of national economic construction, make appropriate arrangements based on the needs and possible conditions, and resolutely strive to realize the general line and general tasks of the transition period as instructed by Chairman Mao.

Director Guo Moruo pointed out that the tasks of national cultural and educational work this year are arduous. He said that in order to ensure that the tasks of cultural and educational work can be well completed, we must first act in accordance with the plan. We should actively do what should be done, and we should not do or postpone what should not be done, or what should be done tomorrow but not today. Only in this way can we accurately complete the various tasks stipulated in the plan. He also said that the key to strengthening the planned nature of our work lies in improving our leadership. Therefore, this year, cultural and educational organs at all levels should continue to carry out the struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism in conjunction with their regular work. We must promote the overall perspective among cadres, closely link with the masses, and a practical and simple work style, and oppose such incorrect tendencies as localism, individualism, and coercion, formalism, and exaggeration. We must continue to practice thrift, oppose waste, tap potential, and use human and material resources more rationally.

Director Guo Moruo finally pointed out that our cultural and educational workers are a team of more than two million people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we must further strengthen unity in the future. Regardless of age, or which aspect, we should respect and help each other, and on this basis, step up the study of Marxism-Leninism, learn from advanced Soviet experience, closely connect with reality, and study the general line of the state during the transition period, so as to continuously improve our political and professional level, and strive for the gradual realization of the historical task of the great socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

At the meeting on the 13th, Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Government Administration Council's Committee on Cultural and Educational Affairs, made a report on the guiding principles and tasks of cultural and educational work in 1954.

In his report, Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun summarized the cultural and educational work in 1953. He pointed out that 1953 was the first year that our country began to implement the First Five-Year Plan. On the basis of the past restoration, reform, and development, our cultural and educational undertakings began to work in accordance with the national plan, and basically completed the tasks stipulated in the 1953 National Cultural and Educational Development Plan. In 1953, the working policy of "consolidation, key development, improvement of quality, and steady progress" was implemented, the past achievements were consolidated, the blind development tendencies in some cultural and educational undertakings were corrected, the specific guidelines for many tasks were clarified, and the national cultural and educational undertakings were brought into the track of national construction. Consolidation and improvement work were carried out on cultural and educational undertakings: institutions of higher learning basically completed the adjustment of departments and faculties, clearly stipulated the training objectives of higher industrial schools, comprehensive universities, and higher normal schools, and carried out teaching reform work; secondary schools have basically overcome the chaos and improved teaching work; primary school education and illiteracy eradication work have also been improved after preliminary rectification; in the field of cultural and artistic work, the leadership methods of literary and artistic work have been improved, drama reform has continued to be promoted, the reorganization of various types of state-owned theatrical troupes has been basically completed, and the rectification of cultural centers and cultural stations has begun; in the field of scientific research, learning from the Soviet Union, combining with reality, and especially active cooperation with industrial departments, certain achievements have been made, and resource survey work has made progress; in the field of health and sports work, the formalism and coercive command tendencies in the patriotic health campaign have been corrected, urban medical institutions and county health centers and district health stations have begun to be rectified with emphasis, and mass sports activities have been gradually carried out; in the field of publishing work, the types of newspapers and periodicals have been adjusted, the planned nature of publishing and distribution work has been strengthened, and the leadership and management of private publishing industry have been strengthened. Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned rectification and improvement measures, the various undertakings have achieved relatively reasonable development in accordance with the tasks stipulated in the national plan, especially ensuring the development of various key undertakings; so that the quality of various cultural and educational work has been improved, and the previous development has been consolidated, thereby creating conditions for the construction of cultural and educational undertakings in the future. Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun pointed out: We must not be satisfied with these achievements. Cultural and educational work still has many shortcomings and errors. The development of cultural and educational undertakings cannot meet the needs of national economic construction and the people's increasing cultural demands; the quality of some work is not high enough; some key undertakings are not prominent enough; some undertakings that should be rectified have not been rectified; and specific guidelines and methods have not been found in some work. In leadership work, political and ideological work is still relatively weak, the collective leadership system is not sound enough, the situation of some work has not been thoroughly understood, and generally it is not good at summarizing experience, and not good at managing people and money. Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun said: All these problems should be solved in future work.

Regarding the guiding principles and tasks of cultural and educational work in 1954, Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun pointed out: It is to follow the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan, continue to implement the working policy of "consolidation, key development, improvement of quality, and steady progress" on the basis of the existing work, promote various cultural and educational undertakings, vigorously train various talents necessary for national construction, especially scientific and technical talents and management talents related to industrial construction, and actively improve the people's health, and improve the people's socialist consciousness and cultural level, so as to ensure the victorious advance of the national construction cause. Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun also put forward the following specific tasks for cultural and educational work: develop and improve higher education, rectify and develop secondary specialized education; appropriately develop and improve general education; strengthen the cultural education of workers and peasants and worker-peasant masses; strengthen scientific research work; rectify and develop health undertakings with emphasis, and carry out sports activities; develop and improve cultural and artistic undertakings; develop and improve news, broadcasting and publishing undertakings; develop the cultural and educational undertakings of various ethnic minorities; strengthen religious affairs work; and actively improve foreign cultural exchange work.

Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun emphasized that in order to implement the above-mentioned guiding principles of cultural and educational work and complete this year's cultural and educational development plan, we must strive to improve leadership work. The first is to strengthen political and ideological leadership. In various cultural and educational undertakings, we must conscientiously implement the general line of the state during the transition period, conscientiously implement the various policies of the CPC Central Committee and the Central People's Government; we must strengthen the overall thinking and act according to the plan. We must continue to implement the spirit of opposing bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, criticize the bourgeois ideology of separating business and technology from politics and various ideas that contradict the spirit of the general line, and strive to improve the political and ideological level of leading cadres at all levels. Second, we must strengthen collective leadership. Cultural and educational departments at all levels must gradually establish and improve the collective leadership system, promote democratic style, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. We must resolutely overcome the extremely dangerous mood of individual conceit and prevent and correct the harmful style of destroying the principle of collective leadership and individual decision-making. Third, we must strengthen specific leadership. Cultural and educational departments at all levels must further promote the style of connecting with reality and investigation and research. Fourth, we must practice streamlining and thrift. We must overcome the phenomenon of overstaffing and overlapping institutions in cultural and educational administrative departments, strengthen public institutions, and improve work efficiency. In financial management, we must be careful in planning and budgeting, reduce waste, and use certain money to do more things. Fifth, we must give play to the enthusiasm of local and masses under the principle of strengthening centralized and unified leadership. For various cultural and educational undertakings, graded management and correct division of labor should be implemented. The management of subordinate institutions by cultural and educational departments at all levels should also follow the principle of hierarchical responsibility and clarify their responsibilities.

Deputy Director Xi Zhongxun finally called on all cultural and educational workers in the country to further strengthen unity. In order to strengthen unity, the first requirement is that the Communist Party members in the cultural and educational team continue to carry forward the fine tradition of uniting and fighting with all non-Party cultural and educational workers, and conscientiously implement the CPC Central Committee's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. We must enthusiastically care for the work of non-Party scientists, educators, writers, artists, etc., affirm their achievements, encourage their progress, effectively help them overcome difficulties in their work, and humbly learn from them, oppose and prevent arrogance, bossiness, and the tendency to get out of touch with the masses. He asked all cultural and educational workers to unite closely, study hard, improve their work, and continuously improve their socialist consciousness and professional ability, and strive to build a great socialist country.

The meeting will also listen to supplementary reports from the heads of the central cultural and educational departments, and then, in the spirit of fully promoting democracy, discuss in groups to correctly determine the guiding principles, tasks and plans of cultural and educational work in 1954.

A total of 179 people attended the meeting, including the Director, Deputy Director, members, Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the Government Administration Council's Committee on Cultural and Educational Affairs, as well as the heads of its subordinate ministries, committees, academies, and administrations; the presidents of universities in Beijing and Tianjin; the directors and secretaries-general of the cultural and educational committees of major administrative regions and the heads of their subordinate bureaus; and the heads of the cultural and educational committees of various provinces and cities.

    全国文教工作会议开幕
    政务院文教委员会郭沫若主任致开幕词
    习仲勋副主任报告今年工作的方针任务
    【新华社十三日讯】全国文教工作会议十二日下午起在北京举行。
    这次会议的中心议题是：根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务，在总结一九五三年文教工作的基础上，讨论和确定一九五四年文教工作的方针和任务，以及一九五四年的文教事业计划和五年文教建设的主要指标。
    中央人民政府政务院文教委员会主任郭沫若在开幕词中指出，我们的国家已进入了由新民主主义过渡到社会主义的新的历史时期。我们的文教工作，必须紧紧地跟随着国家经济建设的进展，根据需要和可能的条件，作恰当的部署，坚决地为实现毛主席所指示的过渡时期的总路线和总任务而斗争。
    郭沫若主任指出今年全国文教工作的任务是繁重的。他说，为要使文教工作任务能够很好地完成，首先就要按照计划办事。对应该办的事就积极去办，对不应该办的或者明天应该办而今天还不应该办的就一律不办或缓办，这样才能准确地完成计划所规定的各项任务。他又说，加强我们工作中的计划性，关键问题在于改进我们的领导。因此，今年我们各级文教机关应该结合自己的经常工作，继续进行反对官僚主义、反对主观主义和反对分散主义的斗争，我们要提倡干部中的全局观点、密切联系群众和切实朴素的工作作风，反对那些本位主义、个人主义以及强迫命令、形式主义、虚浮夸张等不正确倾向。我们要继续厉行节约，反对浪费，发掘潜力，更合理地使用人力和物力。
    郭沫若主任最后指出，我们文教工作者是一支拥有二百多万人的队伍，在中国共产党的领导下，今后要更进一步地增强团结，不论老年青年，不论那个方面，都应互相尊重，互相帮助，并在这个基础上，加紧学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联先进经验，密切联系实际，学习国家在过渡时期的总路线，以不断地提高我们的政治和业务水平，为逐步实现伟大的社会主义工业化和社会主义的改造的历史任务而斗争。
    在十三日的会议上，中央人民政府政务院文教委员会副主任习仲勋作了关于一九五四年文化教育工作的方针和任务的报告。
    习仲勋副主任在报告中总结了一九五三年的文化教育工作，他指出：一九五三年是我国开始执行第一个五年建设计划的第一年，我国文化教育事业，在过去的恢复、改革和发展的基础上，开始按照国家计划进行工作，并基本上完成了一九五三年全国文教事业计划所规定的任务。一九五三年，执行了“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，巩固了过去的成绩，纠正了文教事业中某些盲目发展的偏向，明确了许多工作的具体方针，开始将全国文教事业纳入国家建设的轨道。对文教事业进行了整顿和改进工作：高等学校基本上完成了院系调整，明确规定了高等工业学校、综合大学和高等师范学校的培养目标，并开展了教学改革工作；中等学校已基本上克服了混乱现象，改进了教学工作；小学教育和扫除文盲工作也经过初步整顿，有了改进；文化艺术工作方面，改进了文学艺术工作的领导方法，继续推行了戏剧改革，基本上完成了各类国营剧团的整编工作，并已着手整顿文化馆、文化站；科学研究工作方面，学习苏联，结合实际，特别是与产业部门的积极合作，有了一定的成就，资源调查工作有了进展；卫生、体育工作方面，纠正了爱国卫生运动中形式主义和强迫命令的偏向，开始有重点地整顿城市医疗机构和县卫生院、区卫生所，逐步开展了群众性的体育运动；出版工作方面，调整了报刊种类，加强了出版发行工作的计划性，并加强了对于私营出版业的领导和管理。由于采取了上述整顿和改进的措施，才使各项事业按照国家计划所规定的任务，获得了比较合理的发展，特别是保证了各项重点事业的发展；才使各项文教工作的质量得到了提高，以往的发展得到了巩固，从而为今后文教事业的建设创造了条件。习仲勋副主任指出：我们决不能满足于这些成绩，文化教育工作还存在许多缺点和错误，文教事业的发展还不能适应国家经济建设的需要和人民日益增长的文化要求；有些工作的质量还不够高；有些重点事业还不够突出；有些应该整顿的事业还没有整顿；在有些工作中还没有摸出具体方针和办法。在领导工作中，政治思想工作还比较薄弱，集体领导制度还不够健全，有些工作情况仍然还没有摸透，一般还不善于总结经验，还不善于管人、管钱。习仲勋副主任说：所有这些问题都应当在今后工作中努力加以解决。
    关于一九五四年文化教育工作的方针和任务，习仲勋副主任指出：就是遵循国家过渡时期总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务，在现有工作的基础上，继续贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的工作方针，推进各项文化教育事业，大力培养国家建设所必需的各项人材，特别是有关工业建设的科学技术人材和管理人材，并积极地增进人民的健康，提高人民的社会主义觉悟和文化水平，以保障国家建设事业的胜利前进。习仲勋副主任并提出以下文教工作的具体任务：发展和改进高等教育，整顿和发展中等专业教育；适当发展和改进普通教育；加强工农干部和工农群众的文化教育；加强科学研究工作；整顿和有重点地发展卫生事业，开展体育运动；发展和改进文化艺术事业；发展和改进新闻、广播事业和出版事业；发展各少数民族的文化教育事业；加强宗教事务工作；积极改善对外文化交流工作。
    习仲勋副主任强调指出：为了贯彻上述文教工作的方针并完成今年的文教事业计划，必须努力改进领导工作。首先是加强政治思想领导。在各项文教事业中，要切实贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线，认真地执行中共中央和中央人民政府的各项政策；要加强整体思想，按计划办事。要继续贯彻反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的精神，批判业务、技术脱离政治的资产阶级思想以及各种和总路线精神相抵触的思想，努力提高各级领导干部的政治思想水平。其次，要加强集体领导。各级文教部门，都要逐步建立和健全集体领导制度，发扬民主作风，开展批评与自我批评。要坚决克服那种极端危险的个人居功自傲的情绪，防止和纠正破坏集体领导原则、个人决定一切的有害作风。第三，要加强具体领导。各级文教部门必须进一步提倡联系实际和调查研究作风。第四，要厉行精简节约。要克服文教行政部门人浮于事和机构重叠的现象，充实事业单位，提高工作效率。在财务管理上，要精打细算，减少浪费，化一定的钱，办更多的事。第五，要在加强集中统一领导的原则下，发挥地方与群众的积极性。对各项文教事业，应该实行分级管理和正确的分工。各级文教部门对其所属事业单位的管理，亦应按分层负责原则，明确其职责范围。
    习仲勋副主任最后号召全国文化教育工作人员进一步加强团结。为了加强团结，首先要求文教队伍中的共产党员继续发扬和全体党外文教工作者团结奋斗的优良传统，切实执行中共中央对知识分子团结与改造的政策。要热情地关心党外的科学家、教育家、文学家、艺术家等的工作，肯定他们的成绩，鼓励他们的进步，切实帮助他们克服工作中的困难，并虚心向他们学习，反对和防止骄傲自大，盛气凌人，脱离群众的倾向。他要求全体文教工作者亲密地团结起来，努力学习，改进工作，不断地提高社会主义觉悟和业务能力，为建设伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    会议还将陆续听取中央各文教部门负责人的补充报告，然后在充分发扬民主的精神下，分组讨论，以正确确定一九五四年文教工作的方针、任务和计划。
    出席这次会议的共一百七十九人，有中央人民政府政务院文教委员会主任、副主任、委员、秘书长和副秘书长，以及所属各部、会、院、署负责人；北京、天津各大学校长；各大行政区文教委员会主任、秘书长暨所属各局负责人；各省、市文教委员会负责人。
