In order to accelerate industrial development and realize national socialist industrialization, in addition to relying on the construction of hundreds of thousands of important new enterprises, we must also rely on maximizing the role of existing industrial enterprises. China's existing state-owned industries are mainly those inherited from old China. Although its foundation is very weak, it is relatively concentrated and greatly affects people's livelihoods. After these enterprises became state-owned, they became the economic lifeline of the country. It is the material foundation for developing production and prospering the economy, the leading force in the socialist transformation of non-socialist economies, and an important force supporting new construction.

In the past few years, existing state-owned enterprises have undergone democratic reforms, production reforms, and the increase production and practice economy movement. Especially since last year, as a result of implementing planned management, the broad masses of workers and engineering and technical personnel have developed their enthusiasm and creativity, learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, greatly broken through the old production quota standards, improved production, and changed the face of the enterprises. Comparing 1953 with 1949, the utilization rate of power equipment increased from 26 percent to 53 percent, the total recovery rate of coal mines increased from 30 percent to 76 percent, and the production capacity of various machine tools in the machinery industry has also generally increased a lot. Many important products that China could not manufacture in the past, such as various Soviet-style machine tools, mining machinery, 20,000 kVA large transformers, 1,000-meter drilling rigs, etc., can now be manufactured by existing state-owned enterprises. In 1953, the five central industrial departments produced hundreds of important new products. The proportion of the total output value of state-owned industry in the country's modern industry has also risen from more than 30 percent in 1949 to more than 50 percent in 1953. The leading position of state-owned enterprises in the national economy has been further consolidated.

Existing state-owned enterprises not only played a huge role in the period of national economic recovery, but also shoulder important tasks in the current period of national construction, when we are developing the national economy at the highest speed and striving to realize national socialist industrialization as soon as possible. Stalin once said in "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan": "Did the party have the practical possibility of realizing the policy of highest speed? Yes, there was such a possibility. It has this possibility not only because it promptly launched our country to advance rapidly, but also because it can rely on old or renovated factories in implementing new expansion construction. These factories are familiar to both workers and engineering and technical personnel, which also gives us the possibility of realizing the highest development speed." The Soviet Union's experience of relying on old or renovated factories to accelerate industrial development is fully applicable to China, which is undergoing its first five-year plan. Some of our enterprise cadres believe that the current enterprises are dilapidated and not large in scale, and they only yearn to build new and large enterprises, while neglecting to give play to the role of existing enterprises, or are not at ease working in existing enterprises. These ideas are obviously very wrong.

What are the specific tasks of existing state-owned enterprises during the national construction period? In what aspects should it promote the country's socialist industrialization? First of all, existing state-owned enterprises should provide equipment, funds and talents for each new enterprise. These are indispensable conditions for carrying out new construction projects. For example, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which we are currently building, requires more than one million tons of main equipment and materials, approximately tens of thousands of billions of yuan of investment, thousands of management cadres, and more technical cadres in the first phase of construction alone. And such projects are not the most complex, nor the most gigantic in scale; in China's entire construction plan, it is not just building such a factory, so the required equipment, funds and talents are even more. In order to provide these conditions, in addition to Soviet assistance, we must also rely on existing enterprises to give full play to their role. Taking the supply of equipment and materials as an example, of the 141 huge projects that the Soviet Union is helping China build and rebuild, China's existing enterprises need to undertake the manufacturing of 30 to 50 percent of the equipment, and China's existing enterprises need to produce supporting and auxiliary semi-finished products, finished products and materials. Projects other than these 141 also rely on existing enterprises to supply equipment and materials. As for accumulating funds and training talents for national construction, it is the main task of existing enterprises. These two tasks are of particularly important significance, because we can mainly rely on importing equipment to build the country's industry, but it is not good and cannot mainly rely on loans to carry out construction, nor is it good and cannot mainly rely on hiring foreign technicians, skilled workers and management cadres to develop the country's industry. Therefore, existing state-owned enterprises must give full play to their potential, strengthen management, improve production, reduce costs, increase profits, accumulate more funds for the country, and at the same time strive to cultivate and train management personnel, technical personnel and skilled workers for new enterprises.

Secondly, during the national construction period, existing state-owned enterprises also shoulder the task of meeting the people's needs for industrial products and leading other economic components to carry out socialist transformation. This is because new enterprises are large in scale and technically complex, and cannot be put into production in large quantities in a short period of time. Therefore, in a considerable period of time, the people's growing needs for industrial products must mainly rely on existing state-owned enterprises to be responsible for the supply. From the experience of the past few years, it can be seen that the needs of the broad masses of the people in our country for industrial products are growing very rapidly. Taking yarn and cloth as an example, if the sales volume of yarn and cloth in the country in 1949 is 100, it will increase to 230 in 1953; at the same time, the requirements for the quality, patterns and varieties of cloth are also increasing day by day. During China's first five-year plan, although some newly built textile factories can be put into production one after another, the number is small, and the task of supplying yarn and cloth mainly relies on existing textile factories to improve production. The task of supplying many other industrial products also mainly relies on existing enterprises to improve production in a considerable period of time.

In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce. To transform agriculture and handicrafts, in addition to gradually changing their ownership through the road of cooperation, it is also necessary to supply them with advanced technical equipment. Supplying agriculture with a large number of tractors or other agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers will of course be the responsibility of building new enterprises, and that will have to wait several more years. However, supplying agriculture with new-style plows, animal-drawn farm tools, waterwheels, pesticides and pesticide equipment, etc., to promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improve agricultural production, is an important task that existing state-owned enterprises, especially local state-owned enterprises, can and should undertake. Supplying handicrafts with the tools, machines and certain raw materials they need to increase production and supplement the shortage of modern industrial products is also a task that existing state-owned enterprises, especially local state-owned enterprises, should undertake. The first step in the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, in addition to strengthening supervision and management of them, is to guide private capitalism onto the track of state capitalism through the connection and cooperation between existing state-owned enterprises and capitalist industry and commerce. In particular, transforming private enterprises into joint state-private enterprises depends on the state's investment and the number of cadres that can be dispatched, and the task of providing money and personnel mainly relies on existing state-owned enterprises.

The tasks of existing state-owned enterprises are very arduous. But it is entirely possible to complete these tasks. At present, the most central link is that we must vigorously give play to the potential of existing enterprises in all aspects and give play to their role during the national construction period. From the perspective of production, the potential strength of existing state-owned enterprises is still very large and can be fully utilized. For example, the equipment of some existing enterprises is distributed very unevenly and unreasonably, some equipment has not been fully utilized, and some equipment is even idle and has not been utilized. If it is properly adjusted and reorganized, production can be improved. Some enterprises are poorly managed, and production efficiency is very low compared with advanced enterprises; even within advanced enterprises, advanced workshops and backward workshops, good months of production and bad months of production often differ greatly. If enterprise management can be improved, the production area management system can be implemented, job planning can be promoted, balanced production can be organized, technical management can be strengthened, defective products can be reduced, operations can be improved, advanced enterprises can be further improved, and backward enterprises can be improved to the level of advanced enterprises, production can also be improved. Some enterprises have not well mobilized employees to discuss the enterprise's production, technology, and financial plans, have not carried out regular labor competitions, the wisdom and labor enthusiasm of workers have not been fully utilized, and have not paid enough attention to and promoted the inventions, creations, rationalization proposals, and advanced experiences of the working masses. If we can strengthen this aspect of work, production can also be improved. There are also many enterprises that do not pay attention to research and adopt effective technical organizational measures, do not pay attention to technical improvements; some enterprises ignore the needs of the people and do not pay attention to new product trial production; some leaders of enterprises only see the interests and needs of their own units and do not pay attention to cooperation between enterprises. These all hinder the exertion of the potential of existing enterprises. If we can strengthen the leadership of technical organizational measures and improve the technical level of workers; if we can rebuild or expand some existing enterprises according to needs and possibilities, add some new equipment, and implement mechanized production; if we can strengthen the work of trial production of new products, and manufacture new products in large quantities according to needs after the trial production is finalized; finally, if we strengthen the organizational role of planning work and overcome the isolationist thinking and departmentalism of some comrades, so that various departments or enterprises can cooperate well, then we can greatly increase production.

In terms of operation and management, existing enterprises also have great potential strength. At present, some existing state-owned enterprises still have phenomena such as stockpiling or improper use of raw materials, materials and equipment, as well as low product quality, many defective products, slow capital turnover, too many redundant personnel, unreasonable labor organization, and excessive miscellaneous expenses. If everyone conscientiously opposes waste and practices economy, if everyone not only completes the output and output value plans, but also strives to complete the product quality and variety plans, strives to complete the plans for improving labor productivity and reducing costs, and actively completes the financial, profit delivery and other plans, and strictly implements the labor and wage plans, we can not only increase production, but also greatly save funds and increase the country's capital accumulation.

Existing state-owned enterprises also have strong potential in training and transporting cadres and technical forces. Because existing enterprises have a large number of actual workers, young technical personnel and skilled workers, initiators of labor competitions, creators and active promoters of advanced experience, they are all objects that can be promoted and cultivated; existing enterprises have many excellent management cadres, technical cadres and veteran technicians, and some enterprises also have the help of Soviet experts, they can and should take on the responsibility of training talents; and the production of existing enterprises is a good course for training talents and a large laboratory for training talents. The problem is that many existing enterprises lack plans for the work of promoting and cultivating talents, and also lack organization for learning from Soviet experts, so they have not cultivated talents well. Some enterprises have organized the work of learning from Soviet experts, and some enterprises have selected some employees or excellent young technical workers with promising development prospects to give them the opportunity to directly learn from Soviet experts, and they have cultivated a group of talents in a short period of time. Some enterprises have adopted the policy of "self-reliance and taking materials locally," using the methods of running spare-time schools or spare-time training classes, signing contracts for teaching and learning between masters and apprentices in production, regularly and periodically holding technical research meetings or business research meetings, and generally setting up deputy positions, etc., to cultivate talents, and have achieved great success. These methods are worthy of universal attention and specific promotion by existing enterprises. If existing state-owned enterprises can promote, cultivate and train talents in a planned and organized manner, then they can not only solve the talents they need, but also transport a large number of talents.

Giving full play to the potential of existing state-owned enterprises and completing the plans for producing people, money, machines and increasing the production of industrial products is the glorious task of all employees of existing state-owned enterprises, and it is the greatest contribution to the country's socialist industrialization. All employees of existing state-owned enterprises should strive to complete this glorious task.

    发挥现有国营工业企业在建设期中的作用
    加速工业的发展和实现国家社会主义工业化，除了依靠新建成百成千重要的企业外，还必须依靠尽量发挥现有工业企业的作用。我国现有的国营工业，主要是旧中国遗留下来的，它的基础虽然十分薄弱，但却较为集中，影响国民生计很大。这些企业变为全民所有的国营企业以后，就成为国家的经济命脉。它是目前发展生产、繁荣经济的物质基础，是对非社会主义经济进行社会主义改造的领导力量，也是支持新建设的重要力量。
    几年来，现有国营企业经过民主改革、生产改革和增产节约运动，特别是去年以来，开始实行计划管理的结果，广大的工人和工程技术人员发扬了积极性和创造性，学习了苏联先进经验，大大地突破了旧时的生产定额标准，提高了生产，也改变了企业的面貌。以一九五三年和一九四九年作比较，电力设备利用率从百分之二十六提高到百分之五十三，煤矿总回采率从百分之三十提高到百分之七十六，机器工业中各种机床的生产能力也普遍提高很多。我国过去不能制造的许多重要产品，如各种苏联式工作母机、矿山机器、二万千伏安的大型变压器、一千公尺钻探机等等，现有国营企业已经能够制造了。一九五三年中央五个工业部门新制的重要的新产品就有数百种。国营工业的总产值在全国现代工业中的比重，也由一九四九年的百分之三十多，上升到一九五三年的百分之五十以上。国营企业在国民经济中的领导地位是更加巩固了。
    现有国营企业，不仅，在国民经济恢复时期发挥了巨大作用，即在目前，在我国进入了有计划的建设时期、在我们要用最高速度发展国民经济，争取早日实现国家社会主义工业化的过程中，它同样担负着重要的任务。斯大林在“第一个五年计划底总结”中曾经说过：“党有过实现最高速度政策的实际可能么？是的，是有过这种可能的。它所以有这种可能，不仅是因为它及时发动了我们国家迅速前进，而且首先是因为它在实行新的扩大建设中能够依靠旧有的工厂或革新的工厂，这些工厂既为工人和工程技术人员所熟习，也就给了我们实行最高发展速度的可能。”苏联依靠旧有工厂或革新的工厂以加速工业发展的经验，对于正在进行第一个五年计划建设的我国来说，是完全适用的。我们某些企业干部，认为现在企业破破烂烂，规模不大，一心只向往着建立新的、大的企业，而忽视了发挥现有企业的作用，或者不安心在现有企业中工作，这些想法，显然都是十分错误的。
    现有国营企业在国家建设时期的具体任务是什么呢？它应该从那些方面来促进国家的社会主义工业化呢？首先，就是现有国营企业应该为每一个新建企业提供设备、资金和人材，这些都是进行新建工程必不可少的条件。例如，我们目前正在建设的第一汽车制造厂，仅第一期建筑中用的主要设备和材料，就需要一百多万吨，约需要数万亿元的投资，需要上千的管理干部和更多的技术干部。而这样的工程，还不是最复杂的、也不是规模最巨大的；在我国的整个建设计划中，更不是只建设这样的一座工厂，因此，所需要的设备、资金和人材那就更多了。为了提供这些条件，除了苏联的援助外，还要依靠现有企业充分发挥作用。只以供应设备和材料来说，苏联帮助我国建设与改建的一百四十一项巨大工程中，就需要我国现有企业担负制造百分之三十至五十的设备，并且需要我国现有企业生产配套用的和辅助性的半制品、成品和材料。这一百四十一项以外的工程，也要依靠现有企业来供应设备和材料。至于为国家建设积累资金和训练人材，更是现有企业的主要任务了。这两项任务还有着特别重要的意义，因为我们可以主要依靠输入设备来建设国家的工业，但是却不好和不能主要依靠借贷来进行建设，也不好和不能主要依靠聘请国外的技师、熟练工人和管理干部来发展国家的工业。因此，现有国营企业就必须充分发挥潜力，加强经营管理工作，提高生产、降低成本、增加盈利，为国家积累更多资金，同时要努力地为新的企业培养和训练管理人员、技术人员和熟练工人。
    其次，在国家建设时期中，现有国营企业还担负着满足人民对工业产品的需要的任务和领导其它经济成分进行社会主义改造的任务。这是由于新建企业的规模很大，技术复杂，短时间内不能大量投入生产，所以在相当时期内，人民日益增长的对工业品的需要，必须主要依靠现有国营企业负责供应。从过去几年的经验中，可以看到我国广大人民对工业品的需要是增长得很快的，以纱布为例，如以一九四九年全国纱布的销售量为一百，则一九五三年就增长为二百三十；同时，对于布匹的质量、花色、品种的要求也正日益提高。在我国第一个五年计划期间内，虽有一些新建的纺织厂可以陆续投入生产，但为数不多，纱布的供应任务，主要仍靠现有纺织厂提高生产来担负。其他许多工业品的供应任务，在相当时期内，也是主要依靠现有企业提高生产来担负。
    为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，必须对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造。要改造农业和手工业，除了经过合作化的道路，逐步改变其所有制而外，还得供给它们以进步的技术设备。大量供给农业以拖拉机或其他农业机器和化学肥料，那当然是要靠建设新企业来担负，那还得再过若干年才行，但供给农业以新式步犁、马拉农具、水车、农药及农药器械等等，用以促进互助合作运动和提高农业生产，则是现有国营企业特别是地方国营企业当前就可以而且应该负担的重要任务。供给手工业所需要的工具、机器和某些原料，使之增加生产，以补现代工业产品的不足，也是现有国营企业、特别是地方国营企业应该负担的任务。国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的第一个步骤，除了加强对他们的监督和管理而外，就是经过现有国营企业对资本主义工商业的联系和合作，把私人资本主义引导到国家资本主义的轨道上来，特别是要把私营企业改变成公私合营企业，更是取决于国家的投资和能派遣的干部有多少等等条件，而这个出钱出人的任务，也主要是依靠现有国营企业来担负的。
    现有国营企业的任务是十分艰巨的。但是要完成这些任务也是完全可能的。目前，最中心的一环，就是必须从各方面大力发挥现有企业的潜力，发挥其在国家建设期中的作用。以生产情况来看，现有国营企业的潜在力量还是很大的，是可以充分发挥的。例如，有些现有企业的设备分布得很不平衡和很不合理，有些设备尚未充分加以利用，有些设备甚至还闲置着未被利用，如果适当加以调整和改组，就可以提高生产。有些企业管理得不好，与先进企业比较，生产效率很低；即在先进企业内部，先进车间与落后车间、生产好的月份与生产不好的月份也常常相差很大，如能改善企业管理工作，实行生产区域管理制，推行作业计划，组织均衡生产，加强技术管理，减少废品次品，改善经营，进一步提高先进企业，把落后企业提高到先进企业的水平，也可提高生产。有些企业没有很好发动职工讨论企业的生产、技术、财务计划，没有开展经常性的劳动竞赛，工人的智慧和劳动热情没有充分发挥出来，对工人群众的发明创造、合理化建议和先进经验重视与推广不够，如能加强这方面的工作，也可提高生产。还有不少企业，不注意研究和采取有效的技术组织措施，不注意技术的改进；有些企业忽视人民的需要，不注意新产品试制工作；有些企业的领导同志只看到本单位的利益和需要，不注意企业间的协作，这些，都妨害了现有企业潜力的发挥，如果我们能加强对技术组织措施的领导，提高工人的技术水平；如果我们对某些现有企业，根据需要和可能加以改建或扩建，增添某些新设备，实行机械化生产；如果我们能加强试制新产品的工作，并且在试制定型之后，根据需要大量制造新产品；最后，如果我们加强计划工作的组织作用，并且克服某些同志中的孤立思想和本位主义，使各部门或各企业之间能够很好地协作配合，那末，我们也就可以大大提高生产。
    在经营管理方面，现有企业也存在着很大的潜在力量。目前，若干现有国营企业中还存在着原材料、物资和设备的积压或使用不当等现象，还存在着产品质量低劣、废品很多、资金周转缓慢、冗员过多、劳动组织不合理、杂费标准太高等等浪费现象，如果大家都认真反对浪费，厉行节约，如果大家都不仅完成产量和产值计划，而且努力完成产品质量和品种计划，努力完成提高劳动生产率、降低成本等计划，积极完成财务、上缴利润等计划，严格执行劳动和工资计划，就可以不仅增加生产，而且可以大大节约资金，增加国家的资金积累。
    现有国营企业在培养、输送干部和技术力量方面，也同样存在雄厚的潜在力量。因为现有企业有着为数众多的实际工作人员、青年技术人员和熟练工人、劳动竞赛的发起人、先进经验底创造者和积极推广人，他们都是可以提拔和培养的对象；现有企业中有着许多优秀的管理干部、技术干部和老技术工人，有的企业还有苏联专家的帮助，他们都可以也应该担当培养人材的责任；而现有企业的生产本身更是一门培养人材的好课程，也是一个培养人材的大实验室。问题在于许多现有企业对于提拔和培养人材的工作缺乏计划，对于向苏联专家学习也缺乏组织，因而就没有很好地培养出人材来。有些企业有组织地进行了向苏联专家学习的工作，有些企业选拔了一些有培养前途的工作人员或优秀的青年技术工人，给以直接向苏联专家学习的机会，他们已经在短时期内就培养出一批人材来了。有些企业采取“自力更生、就地取材”的方针，用开办业余学校或业余训练班，在生产中签订师徒间的包教包学合同，经常地定期地举行技术研究会或业务研究会，普遍设立副职等等办法来培养人材，都取得了很大的成就。这些办法都是值得现有企业普遍加以重视和具体推行的。如果现有国营企业能够有计划有组织地提拔、培养和训练人材，那么它们就不仅能够解决本身所需要的人材，而且可以大量输送出人材来。
    充分发挥现有国营企业的潜在力量，完成出人、出钱、出机器和增加工业品生产的计划，这是现有国营企业全体职工的光荣任务，是对国家社会主义工业化的最伟大的贡献，现有国营企业的全体职工们应为争取完成这一光荣任务而奋斗。
