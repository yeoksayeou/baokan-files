Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's State Council issued a directive on March 23 regarding the 1954 advance purchase of agricultural products. The directive stipulates that in 1954, the state will entrust the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to pre-purchase grain, cotton, peanuts, tea, jute, ambary hemp, ramie, silkworm cocoons, tussah silkworm cocoons, spun silk, wool, and other agricultural and pastoral products from farmers through the advance purchase contract system.

The directive first points out that establishing an advance purchase contract system with farmers is a new method for the state to procure agricultural products. Through the advance purchase contract system, the state can not only promptly secure the necessary quantity of agricultural products to ensure the needs of national economic construction and the people's livelihood, but it is also an important way to promote the stable production of the small-scale peasant economy, increase the yield per unit area, gradually bring the small-scale peasant economy into the orbit of state planning, and gradually transform the small-scale peasant economy into a collective agricultural economy. At the same time, through the advance purchase contract system, some assistance can be provided to poor and middle peasants in terms of production and even livelihood, the exploitation of usury in rural areas can be restricted, and the ties between the state and farmers can be further strengthened, consolidating the combination of urban and rural economies.

The directive points out that the targets of the advance purchase of agricultural products should mainly be agricultural producers' cooperatives, permanent mutual aid teams, temporary mutual aid teams, and supply and marketing cooperative member groups. Advance purchases should also be carried out simultaneously with individual poor and middle peasants, and even rich peasants. However, only credit advance purchases should be carried out with rich peasants, and no advance purchase deposits should be paid to them. The directive requires that when carrying out advance purchase work in various places, it is necessary to combine it with the publicity and education of the general line of the transition period, sign advance purchase contracts on the basis of the peasants' voluntary participation, and prevent the style of coercion and commandism. After signing advance purchase contracts with farmers, it is necessary to educate farmers to abide by contract credit and ensure that they sell the pre-purchased products to the state as stipulated in the contract.

In order to reflect the state's support for farmers' production and livelihood, and to attract farmers to accept state advance purchases, the directive stipulates that at the time of advance purchase, a certain proportion of the total value of the advance purchase should be paid in cash to the farmers who sign the contract as a deposit. The directive points out that when stipulating the proportion of advance deposits, it is necessary to effectively take into account the needs of some poor peasants who had to sell green crops in the past. The use of deposits should be specifically controlled according to different varieties, different situations in new areas, old areas, disaster areas, non-disaster areas, economic crop areas, grain-producing areas, and the degree of difficulty of pre-purchase households. Supply and marketing cooperatives should combine the deposit input with the needs of farmers to do a good job in the supply of means of production and means of livelihood, in order to achieve the requirements of both saving state funds and completing the advance purchase plan, and promoting the development of farmers' production.

The directive stipulates the price policy for state advance purchase of agricultural products. All pre-purchased products shall be purchased in accordance with the state-announced purchase prices at the time the products are put on the market. It is also guaranteed to price according to quality, with higher prices for higher grades, and to implement the state's price policy. The directive requires local governments to strengthen market management when agricultural products are put on the market this year to prevent private merchants from raising prices and rushing to purchase, so as to protect the interests of farmers.

The directive finally points out that in order to do a good job in the advance purchase of agricultural products in 1954, the financial and economic departments of local governments must strengthen their leadership over this work, carry out unified arrangements, and strengthen supervision, inspection, and assistance to the relevant departments. The relevant central departments and their subordinate departments in various localities should also closely cooperate in the advance purchase and purchase prices, plans, funds, material supply, agricultural technical guidance, and strengthening market management, and strengthen organizational leadership to ensure the victorious completion of the pre-purchase tasks.

    政务院财经委员会发出指示
    委托合作社预购农产品
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会于三月二十三日发出了关于一九五四年农产品预购工作的指示。指示规定一九五四年国家委托中华全国合作社联合总社通过预购合同制向农民预购粮食、棉花以及花生、茶叶、黄麻、洋麻、青麻、家蚕茧、柞蚕茧、土丝、羊毛等农、牧业产品。
    指示首先指出：和农民建立预购合同制是国家采购农产品的一个新方法。通过预购合同制，不仅可以使国家能及时掌握必要数量的农产品，保证供应国家经济建设和人民生活的需要，而且是促使小农经济稳定生产和提高单位面积产量，并逐步把小农经济纳入国家计划轨道，逐步改造小农经济为集体农业经济的重要方式之一。同时，通过预购合同制，可以给予贫农和中农生产上以至生活上一些帮助，限制农村高利贷的剥削，使国家与农民间进一步密切联系，巩固城乡经济的结合。
    指示指出：农产品预购的对象，应以农业生产合作社、常年互助组、临时互助组及供销合作社社员小组为主。对个体的贫农和中农以至富农也同时进行预购。但向富农只进行信用预购，不付给他们预购定金。指示要求各地在开展预购工作时，必须结合过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，在农民自愿的基础上签订预购合同，防止强迫命令作风。在与农民签订了预购合同以后，要教育农民遵守合同信用，使其保证按合同规定将预购产品卖给国家。
    为了体现国家对农民生产和生活上的扶助，并吸引农民接受国家预购，指示规定在预购时，要根据预购总值预付一定比例的现款给订合同的农民，作为定金。指示指出：在规定预付定金的比例时，必须切实照顾过去非卖青苗不可的一部分贫农的需要。对定金的使用，应根据不同品种，分别新区、老区、灾区、非灾区、经济作物区、粮产区及预购户困难程度等不同情况具体掌握。供销合作社则应根据定金投放结合农民需要，做好生产资料和生活资料的供应工作，以达到既能节省国家资金，又能完成预购计划的要求，并能促进农民发展生产的目的。
    指示对国家预购农产品的价格政策作了规定。预购的产品，一律按照产品上市时国家公布的收购牌价进行收购。并保证做到按质论价，优级优价，贯彻国家的价格政策。指示要求各地政府在今年农产品上市时，必须加强市场管理，防止私商抬价抢购，以保护农民利益。
    指示最后指出：为了做好一九五四年农产品的预购工作，各地政府财政经济部门必须加强对这一工作的领导，进行统一布置，并加强对各有关部门的督促、检查和帮助。中央各有关部门及其在各地的所属部门，亦应在预购和收购的价格、计划、资金、物资供应、农业技术指导和加强市场管理等方面密切配合，加强组织领导，以保证预购任务的胜利完成。
