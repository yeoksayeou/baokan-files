    The Growth of a Female Foreman
    By our reporter Chang Gong

    Last year, when the Seamless Steel Tube Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was completed, one day at noon, Xu Xing, the manager of the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, invited me to see the heating furnace they had built. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant has two heating furnaces, one called the continuous heating furnace and the other the reheating furnace, both of which are the most modern furnaces in China today. As soon as we walked into the gate of the construction site, a female comrade covered in dirt ran up to us and said happily:
    "Manager Xu, our heating furnace has been inspected and approved."
    Manager Xu was very happy and shook hands with the female comrade.
    Her name is Wang Jiazheng, and she is a trainee technician from the production unit of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. According to the advanced experience of Soviet construction, the production unit must send people to participate in each project construction, so that they can quickly put it into production after the construction is completed, and quickly solve the problems even if they occur during production. Wang Jiazheng was sent by the production unit of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant.
    "How is she working?"
    "Not bad, you can say quite good." Manager Xu said, and then he talked to me about Wang Jiazheng.

    He said: One afternoon, he and Soviet expert Comrade Butenek went to the Seamless Steel Tube Plant to see the construction of the heating furnace. When they walked to the reheating furnace, they saw Wang Jiazheng cutting bricks with the workers. Seeing her awkward appearance, they knew that she had never done this kind of work before. But she was not embarrassed at all, just kept asking the workers next to her: sometimes asking how to hold the knife; sometimes asking how to place the brick; sometimes asking how to cut it quickly and ensure quality.

    The Soviet expert watched her cutting for a long time and only managed to cut one brick, so he couldn't help but laugh, walked up to her and asked, "Are you a recent graduate?"

    She said a little embarrassed, "Yes."

    "Didn't you study furnace construction at school?"

    "I didn't study this subject. I studied heat treatment."

    The Soviet expert then shook her hand and said, "You are working in the right direction. You can't cut bricks well now, but as long as you can learn from the workers, I believe you will be able to cut well in a month."

    This happened not long after she was sent from the Seamless Steel Tube Plant to the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company. People may ask, why was she able to do this from the beginning? When I visited her, I learned that the reason she was able to do this was inseparable from the party's continuous education and encouragement. In September 1952, when she came to Anshan Iron and Steel from school, the party leader of the school said to her: "You are going to the most important place in the country's construction. You must realize that what you have learned in school is far from meeting the actual needs. You must learn well from scratch after you get there."

    When she came to the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company from the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the director told her the task and asked her with concern: "What do you think?"

    "I didn't study it at school!"

    The director said to her: "No matter whether you have studied it in the past, you have to start from scratch now. If we don't understand what's going on during construction, it will be difficult to manage production in the future!"

    She heard that what the director and the responsible comrades in the school said was the same, and she thought that she was a member of the Communist Youth League and should resolutely implement the party's instructions, and she was determined to learn from scratch. However, this place is different from the school. In the school, you can study in peace and stability, but here it is like a boiling sea. How should she study?

    The director seemed to guess her mood. Before she could speak, he said to her: "Here, the best way to learn is to learn from work, starting from the bottom."

    After she arrived at the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company, her confidence became even firmer. At that time, the furnace construction project had just begun, and there were very few technicians in the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company. The company warmly welcomed her and immediately assigned her to be the duty technician for the construction of the reheating furnace. She was very happy in her heart and determined to learn from scratch. Although she didn't know how to start at the time, she thought that the director asked her to participate in this work not only to help the Industrial Furnace Construction Engineering Company and learn general furnace construction knowledge, but more importantly, to know how each brick of the furnace was built, so that she could manage the furnace well in the future. Therefore, she initially planned to learn from scratch with the workers according to the furnace construction process - cutting bricks, pulling lines, laying ash, and laying bricks.

    As soon as she started work, she said to the squad leader Zhu Mingkui: "I just came out of school and don't know anything about furnace construction. Everyone must help me a lot. I am determined to learn from you."

    Zhu Mingkui was happy to see that she was very humble and said, "Everyone is learning now. You came at the right time. You have culture and knowledge. We have to learn from you!"

    This is how she started her work. She was very humble and got along well with the workers. However, the workers saw that she was a female comrade, and they were inevitably a little restrained when getting along with her, which more or less affected her learning. But she is a person who loves activities. In addition to loving work, she also likes to sing and act. She saw that the workers were busy all day and their lives were very monotonous, so she helped the workers carry out recreational activities through the Communist Youth League members among the workers. A new atmosphere immediately appeared on the construction site, and enthusiastic singing and laughter rang out during breaks. The workers naturally blended in with her.

    One day at noon break, Zhu Mingkui said to her very kindly: "Lao Wang, I really didn't expect you to be able to do this from the beginning."

    She smiled and said, "Isn't that good?"

    "Good, good," Zhu Mingkui said, "Everyone likes you very much!"

    She had just found her way in her work, and Soviet expert Comrade Butenek had just affirmed her learning direction when an incident occurred that she still takes as a warning: One day, as soon as they started work, two workers who were building a heating furnace started a heated competition. At that time, the workers were in high spirits, and some people didn't even go to the cafeteria to eat, but bought some steamed buns to eat while working. Seeing this hot scene, she ran to the continuous heating furnace to see, and then ran back to the reheating furnace to encourage them. She was too excited and only paid attention to the quality of the furnace bottom, but neglected the quality of the flue. When they got off work, Soviet expert Comrade Butenek came, and after an inspection, he found that some of the bricks in the flue were not built well, so he turned around and asked her: "Who is on duty today?"

    "Me."

    The Soviet expert pointed to the few bricks that were not built well and asked her:
    "Why didn't you check here?"

    She knew that she had neglected it and couldn't say anything for a while. The Soviet expert said to her: "This is not a very difficult thing to do! It can be avoided with a little attention. Why didn't you notice it! A person who has a high sense of responsibility for the country's construction cause, whether they started working early or just started learning, they not only pay attention to the big places, but also pay attention to the small places."

    This was a great lesson for her. After this incident, she studied even more seriously and carefully. She not only learned how to do it, but also learned why to do it. She carefully studied every suggestion of the workers with a learning attitude. Her study and work have taken another big step forward. When they started laying chromemagnesium bricks at the bottom of the furnace, squad leader Zhu Mingkui once said to her: "I want to make a suggestion, I don't know if it will work?"

    "What suggestion is it?"

    "According to the design drawings, the chromemagnesium bricks should be laid in a herringbone pattern, and the top of the herringbone pattern should be aligned with the end burner, so many bricks have to be cut, which is a great loss to the country. In my opinion, if the top of the herringbone pattern is changed from aligning with the end burner to aligning with the side burner, many fewer bricks will be cut, which can save a lot of money for the country."

    She felt that this suggestion was very valuable, so she and Zhu Mingkui went into the furnace to study. She found that Zhu Mingkui's suggestion could not only save a lot of property for the country, but also speed up the project progress and ensure quality. After carefully studying it, she felt that this suggestion was very important, so she ran to consult the Soviet expert.

    As soon as the Soviet expert heard this, he asked her: "What do you think?"

    "I think this suggestion is very important and the design should be changed."

    The Soviet expert nodded and said approvingly: "Your analysis is correct, I agree to change the design, now you can do it according to Zhu Mingkui's suggestion!"

    It was precisely because she studied so seriously from the beginning that she quickly mastered and became familiar with the business of building heating furnaces; and was able to raise problems and solve problems. After the Seamless Steel Tube Plant officially started hot test rolling, she was also able to calmly deal with some of the problems she encountered. When the reheating furnace was being baked, such a thing happened: That day, after she saw the blazing fire burning, and nothing happened, she went to work on other things. Unexpectedly, not long after she left, the onduty worker ran to her in a panic and said:
    "There is an accident at the bottom of the furnace."
    "What accident?"
    "Water is flowing out of the bottom of the furnace. No one knows what's going on. Go and take a look!"

    She ran to the front of the furnace and found that there was indeed water on the bottom of the furnace. Where did the water come from? She first considered it was cooling water, but there was no such equipment in the furnace during construction. She also thought it was groundwater, but the bottom of the furnace was very thick, and the bottom layer had been waterproofed. Finally, she remembered that when they built the bottom of the furnace, it was in the winter of 1952. At that time, there was not enough cold protection equipment, and the red bricks laid at the bottom of the furnace were frozen, and then fireproof bricks were laid around them. These frozen red bricks were wrapped inside and isolated from the outside world, and may not have melted all the time. Now when they encounter high heat, they begin to melt and flow out of the water. Thinking of this, she said to the workers:
    "It doesn't matter, the water will be gone in a while."

    At this time, the Soviet expert also came. She was afraid that her judgment was incorrect, so she told the whole story from beginning to end, wanting to seek the expert's opinion. The Soviet expert was very satisfied with her judgment after hearing her, and praised her judgment ability. Afterwards, not long after, the water at the bottom of the furnace was indeed gone.

    "When I started learning like this, I didn't realize the importance of this issue." She said at the end of her conversation with me: "Now I know that this is a correct path that a student who graduates from school and participates in work should take."

    She was approved to become a Communist Party member last autumn. When the Seamless Steel Tube Plant officially started production, she was promoted to be a female foreman of the hot rolling section of the first automated seamless steel tube plant in China.

    一个女工长的成长
    本报记者　常工
    去年鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂竣工的时候，有一天中午，工业筑炉工程公司徐行经理，邀我去看他们修筑的加热炉。无缝钢管厂的加热炉，一共有两座，一座叫连续加热炉，一座叫再加热炉，都是我国目前最新式的炉子。我们刚一走进工地大门，一个满身泥土的女同志，迎面跑过来高兴地说：
    “徐经理，咱们的加热炉已经验好了。”
    徐行经理很高兴，连忙和那个女同志握手。
    她叫汪家铮，是无缝钢管厂生产单位的一个见习技术员。根据苏联建设的先进经验，在每项工程建设的同时，生产单位必须派人参加，以便在建设完成以后，能够很快地投入生产，即使生产中发生了问题，也能很快地解决。汪家铮就是无缝钢管厂生产单位派来的。
    “她工作得怎样？”
    “不坏，可以说相当好。”徐行经理说，接着他便同我谈起汪家铮来。
    他说：有一天下午，他同苏联专家布特湼克同志到无缝钢管厂去看加热炉的修筑情形。当他们走到再加热炉跟前的时候，就看到汪家铮正和工人们一起割砖。看她那个生手生脚的样儿，就知道她过去从来也没有干过这个活。可是她一点难为情的样子也没有，只是不时地向旁边的工人请教：一会问问工人刀怎样拿才好；一会又问问砖怎么放才好；一会更问问怎样割才能快，也才能保证质量。
    苏联专家看她这样割了好久，才把一块砖割好了，就不由得笑起来，走到她的跟前问道：“你是才从学校里出来的吧？”
    她有些不好意思地说：“是的。”
    “在学校里没有学过筑炉吗？”
    “没有学过这一门。学的是热处理。”
    苏联专家这时握着她的手说：“你这样工作的方向是对的。现在割不好砖，只要你能向工人学习，一个月以后，我相信你一定能割好。”
    这件事发生在她从无缝钢管厂派到工业筑炉工程公司不久的时候。人们或许会问，为什么她一开始就能这样呢？当我访问她的时候，才知道她所以能够这样，是与党对她不断地教导和鼓励分不开的。一九五二年的九月，当她从学校来鞍钢的时候，学校党的负责同志曾对她说：“你是到祖国建设最重要的地方去。你必须认识到在学校学到的东西，是远远跟不上实际需要的，你到那里以后，要从头好好地学。”
    她从无缝钢管厂到工业筑炉工程公司的时候，厂长把她的任务给她讲了以后，也很关心地问她：“你意见如何？”
      “我在学校里没有学过啊！”
    厂长就对她说：“不管过去学过没有学过，现在都得从头学起。建设的时候，咱们不摸清是怎么回事，将来生产也很难管理呀！”
    她听到厂长和学校里的负责同志说的话一样，又想到自己是一个青年团员，应当坚决地执行党的指示，下决心从头学起。但是，这里与学校是两回事，在学校里可以安安稳稳地学习，而这里则像一个沸腾的大海，她该怎么去学习啊？
    厂长好像猜到她的心情似的，还没有等她说话，就对她说：“在这里，最好的学习方法，就是到工作中去学习，从最下层学起。”
    她到工业筑炉工程公司以后，信心就更坚定了。那时筑炉工程刚刚开始不久，工业筑炉工程公司技术人员很少，公司方面对她表示热烈的欢迎，并立即分配她担任修筑再加热炉的值班技术员。她心里很高兴，下决心来从头学起。当时虽说不知道应当怎样开始，但是她想到厂长叫她来参加这一工作，并不仅仅是要她帮助工业筑炉工程公司，并学习一般的筑炉知识，更重要的是应该知道这个炉子的每一块砖，都是怎样砌起来的，以便将来很好地管理这个炉子。因此，她一开始就计划按着筑炉的工序——割砖、拉线、铺灰、砌砖等过程，和工人们一起从头学起。
    她一上班，就对班长朱明奎说：“我刚从学校出来，对于筑炉一点也不懂，大伙可要多多帮助我，我也下了决心，要向大伙好好地学习。”
    朱明奎见她很谦虚，高兴地说：“现在大家都正在学习，你来得正好，有文化，又有知识，我们还要向你学习呢！”
    她就是这样地开始了她的工作。她很虚心，和工人们处得很好。但工人们看她是个女同志，和她相处总是不免有些拘束，这样就或多或少地影响了她的学习。但她是一个爱活动的人，除了热爱工作外，还喜欢唱歌、演戏。她看到工人们一天忙到晚，生活很单调，就通过工人中的青年团员，帮助工人开展文娱活动。工地上立刻出现了新气象，一到休息的时候，就响起热烈的歌声和笑声。工人们很自然地和她融合在一起了。
    有一天中午休息的时候，朱明奎很亲切地对她说：“老汪，我真没有想到你一开始就能这样。”
    她笑着说：“这样不好吗？”
    “好啊好啊，”朱明奎说：“大家都挺喜欢你呀！”
    她在工作上刚刚摸到了门路，苏联专家布特湼克同志刚刚肯定了她的学习方向不久，就发生了一件直到现在为止她还引以为戒的事情：有一天，他们刚刚上班，两个砌筑加热炉的工人，就展开了热烈的竞赛。当时工人们的情绪很高，有些人吃饭都不上食堂去，买些馒头来边吃边干。她看到这种火热的情景，一会跑到连续加热炉去看看，一会就又跑回再加热炉来进行鼓动。她太兴奋了，只注意了炉底的质量，却疏忽了烟道的质量。在他们下班的时候，苏联专家布特湼克同志来了，一检查，发现烟道里有些砖砌得不大好，就回过头来问她：“今天是谁值班？”
      “我。”
    苏联专家指着那几块砌得不大好的砖问她：
  “为什么没有检查这里呢？”
    她知道是疏忽了，一时说不出话来。苏联专家就对她说：“这件事并不是很难办到的！只要稍加注意就可以避免，你为什么竟没有注意到呢！一个对国家建设事业有着高度责任心的人，不论他们早就开始工作，或者是刚刚开始学习，他们不仅仅只注意大的地方，还要注意小的地方。”
    这对她是一个很大的教训。从这件事情发生以后，她更加认真和仔细地去学习了。她不仅仅学习怎样作，还学习为什么这样作，对于工人们的每一个建议，她都能以学习的态度，仔细认真地加以研究。她的学习和工作又大大向前迈进了一步。开始在炉底砌筑铬镁砖的时候，班长朱明奎曾对她说：“我想提一个建议，不知道行不行？”
      “是个什么建议？”
    “按照设计图纸，铬镁砖要砌成人字形，人字形的顶端，要对准端部烧嘴，这样就要割许多砖，对国家损失很大。依我的意见，如果把人字形的顶端，从对准端部烧嘴改为对准侧部烧嘴，这样就少割许多砖，能给国家节省不少的钱。”
    她觉得这个建议很有价值，就和朱明奎钻进炉内去研究。她发现朱明奎的这个建议不仅仅可以为国家节省很多财产，还可以加快工程进度和保证质量。她仔细地研究了以后，觉得这个建议很重要，就连忙跑去请教苏联专家。
    苏联专家一听，就问她：“你的意见怎样？”
    “我认为这个建议很重要，应该改变一下设计。”
    苏联专家点点头，赞许地说：“你的分析是正确的，我同意改变设计，现在你们就照朱明奎的建议去作吧！”
    正由于她这样认真地从头学习，很快就掌握和熟悉了修筑加热炉的业务；并且能够提出问题和解决问题了。无缝钢管厂正式开始热试轧以后，她也能够从容不迫地来处理所遇到的一些问题了。在再加热炉烘炉的时候，就曾经发生了这样的一件事情：那天当她看着熊熊的火光燃烧起来以后，没有发生什么事故，就忙别的工作去了。不料，她走后没有多久，值班工人便慌慌张张地跑来向她说：
  “炉底发生事故了。”
      “什么事故？”
      “炉底往外淌水，谁也摸不清是怎么回事，你快去看看吧！”
    她连忙跑到炉前一看，果然发现炉底上有水。这水是从那里流出来的？她先考虑到是冷却水，但在建设的时候，炉内根本没有这种装备。她又想到这是地下水，但炉底很厚，并且最下层曾经打了防水层。最后她想起了她们砌筑这个炉底的时候，是在一九五二年的冬天，那时防寒设备不够，在炉底里砌的红砖上了冻，以后又在四周砌上了耐火砖，这些上了冻的红砖，就被包在里面，与外界隔开，可能一直都没有融化，现在遇到高热，就开始融化出水了。她想到这里就对工人说：
    “没有关系，过一会，水就会没有了。”
    这时苏联专家也来了。她恐怕自己的判断不正确，就把这件事从头到尾讲了一遍，想征求专家的意见。苏联专家听她一说，很满意她的判断，并且称赞了她的判断能力。事后，没有多久，炉底的水果然一点也没有了。
    “当我这样开始学习的时候，我并没有意识到这个问题的重要。”她在结束她对我谈话的时候说：“现在我才知道这是一个从学校毕业出来参加工作的学生，应该走的一条正确的道路。”
    她在去年秋天已被批准成为一个共产党员。当无缝钢管厂正式开工生产的时候，她又被提升为我国第一座自动化无缝钢管厂热轧工段的一个女工长了。
