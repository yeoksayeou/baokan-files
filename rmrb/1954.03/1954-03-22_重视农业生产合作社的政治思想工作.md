    Emphasize Political Ideological Work in Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    Establishing political ideological work in agricultural production cooperatives is of great significance for consolidating the socialist阵地 [zhèn dì, position, front] in the countryside and, relying on this阵地 [zhèn dì, position, front], eliminating capitalist influences and gradually attracting the broad masses of peasants to the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. This is because: current agricultural production cooperatives are basically established on the basis of private property of the peasants; the members were individual small private owners not long ago, and their old thoughts, viewpoints, and habits cannot be completely changed immediately after joining the agricultural production cooperative; and precisely because they are small producers, spontaneous capitalist tendencies will inevitably arise and have already arisen among them. Therefore, contradictory phenomena occur frequently in agricultural production cooperatives, mainly manifested in the contradictions between the individual interests of the members and the collective interests of the agricultural production cooperative, between immediate interests and long-term interests, and between the interests of the agricultural production cooperative and the interests of the state. Ultimately, it is the contradiction between capitalist ideological tendencies and socialist ideology. This requires arduous political ideological work in order to do a good job in the production of agricultural production cooperatives and to improve the management system of agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of gradually raising the socialist consciousness of the members, and to further consolidate and expand agricultural production cooperatives.

    Establishing political ideological work in agricultural production cooperatives is still a new thing. There are no complete and mature experiences in various places. The experience of the Dongshijing Village Party Branch in Hejian County, Hebei Province, in conducting political ideological leadership in agricultural production cooperatives, which was compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and published in today's "Party Life" column of this newspaper, is worthy of attention by rural work comrades. From this experience, we can see that:

    First, it is necessary to closely link with the actual life of the members, and carry out education around consolidating and developing agricultural production cooperatives and around various practical tasks of developing agricultural production, and mobilize all members to work hard in production and increase income, so that peasants can personally experience the benefits of taking the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and strive to consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives.

    Second, the Party branch must organize Party members, Youth League members, and propagandists in agricultural production cooperatives to understand the work problems and ideological problems of the members in the cooperative in a timely manner, study solutions to the problems, and propose propaganda slogans and propaganda methods based on these actual situations, and organize Party and Youth League members and propagandists to conduct regular propaganda and education work for the members, so that the rural Party branch can regularly play its role in conducting political ideological work in agricultural production cooperatives.

    Third, the methods of conducting political ideological work must be based on the actual situation and adopt a variety of forms. In terms of member self-education, adopt methods such as selecting models, individual talks, typical speeches, combined with appropriate criticism and self-criticism; in terms of improving business management and various systems, emphasize democratic discussion; in terms of technological innovation, adopt typical demonstrations, and utilize the old experience of farmers, etc., which can all be used as references for work in various places.

    Fourth, it is necessary to adopt various methods to strengthen the connection between agricultural production cooperatives and the masses outside the cooperative, and promptly publicize every achievement of the agricultural production cooperative, which not only profoundly educates the members, deepens their love for the cooperative, and facilitates the consolidation of the cooperative, but also greatly promotes the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in the whole village, points out the direction for mutual aid team members and individual farmers, and expands the influence of agricultural production cooperatives and the ideological阵地 [zhèn dì, position, front] of socialism in the countryside.

    In the past two years, agricultural production cooperatives in various places have developed on different scales, but there are still not many experiences summarized in conducting ideological work in agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, accumulating, summarizing, and disseminating experiences in this area is an urgent political task.

### 重视农业生产合作社的政治思想工作

    重视农业生产合作社的政治思想工作
    在农业生产合作社中建立政治思想工作，对于巩固农村社会主义阵地，并进而依靠这个阵地，排除资本主义影响，逐步把广大农民吸引到互助合作道路上来，具有重大的意义。这是因为：现时的农业生产合作社基本上是建立在农民私有财产基础上的；社员不久之前是个体生产的小私有者，他们旧有的思想、观点和生活习惯，在加入农业生产合作社后还不可能立即完全改变；而且正因为他们是小生产者，在他们中间就必然产生而且已经产生自发的资本主义倾向。因此，在农业生产合作社中，经常地发生着矛盾的现象，主要表现在社员的个人利益和农业生产合作社的集体利益，眼前利益和长远利益，农业生产合作社的利益和国家利益的矛盾，归根结底是资本主义思想倾向和社会主义思想的矛盾。这就必须进行艰苦的政治思想工作，以便在逐步提高社员的社会主义觉悟的基础上，搞好农业生产合作社的生产和健全农业生产合作社的经营管理制度，进一步巩固和扩大农业生产合作社。
    在农业生产合作社中建立政治思想工作还是一件新的事情。各地都还没有成套的成熟的经验。今天本报“党的生活”栏发表的中共河北省委宣传部整理的河间县东诗经村党支部对农业生产合作社进行政治思想领导的经验，值得农村工作同志注意。从这个经验中可以看到：
    第一，必须密切地联系社员的实际生活，围绕着巩固和发展农业生产合作社、围绕着发展农业生产的各项实际工作来进行教育，发动全体社员努力生产，增加收入，才能使农民亲身体验到走互助合作道路的好处，而努力巩固和发展农业生产合作社。
    第二，党的支部必须组织农业生产合作社里的党员、团员和宣传员及时了解合作社中的工作问题和社员思想问题，研究出解决问题的办法，并根据这些实际情况提出宣传口号和宣传方法，组织党团员和宣传员向社员进行经常的宣传教育工作，才能经常发挥农村党支部对农业生产合作社进行政治思想工作的作用。
    第三，进行政治思想工作的方式方法必须根据实际情况，采用多种多样的形式。在社员自我教育方面，采取评选模范，个别谈话、典型发言，并结合适当的批评、自我批评；在改善经营管理和各种制度方面，强调民主讨论；在技术革新方面，采用典型示范、利用农民旧有经验等等，都可作为各地工作中的借镜。
    第四，必须采用各种办法，加强农业生产合作社和社外群众的联系，及时宣传农业生产合作社的每一个成就，这就不仅深刻地教育了社员，加深社员热爱社的观念，便于社的巩固，同时还大大地推动了全村的互助合作运动，给互助组员、单干农民指出了前进的方向，扩大了农业生产合作社的影响和社会主义在农村中的思想阵地。
    近两年来，各地农业生产合作社都有不同规模的发展，然而总结出来的在农业生产合作社中进行思想工作的经验还是不多的。因此，积累、总结和传达这方面的经验，乃是一个迫切的政治任务。
