Fujian Forest Area to Produce Large Quantities of Timber

In the famous Fujian forest area, the national plan for timber felling and purchasing this year will be 75 percent more than last year. Among them, timber for basic construction can build 50,000 square meters of houses; sleepers can lay a railway line equivalent to the distance from Tianjin to Jinan, and utility poles can erect a long-distance telephone line or a wired telegraph line from Zhengzhou to Manchuria.

After receiving education on the general line for the transition period, the farmers and loggers in the Fujian forest area have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. They have changed the historical habit of stopping logging in winter and spring and are carrying out year-round operations. By the end of January, various places had completed more than half of the first quarter's production tasks. By the end of February, timber transport workers in various places had also completed 70 percent of the first quarter's timber transfer tasks. They are now studying various methods of rafting and floating rafts in different water conditions so that they can continue to float large quantities of timber out of the remote mountains and valleys during the peak water (sudden changes in water level) and flood seasons in April, May, June, and July.

    福建林区将生产大量木材
    在著名的福建林区内，今年国家计划采伐和收购的木材，将比去年多百分之七十五。其中，基本建设用材可以建筑五万平方公尺的房屋；枕木可以铺设一条相当于天津到济南的铁路线，电杆木可以架设从郑州到满洲里的长途电话线或有线电报线路。
    福建林区的农民和伐木工人，接受了国家过渡时期总路线的教育后，生产热情高涨。他们改变了历史上冬季和春季停止伐木的习惯，进行常年作业。到一月底止，各地已完成今年第一季度生产任务的一半以上。各地运木工人到二月底也已完成了第一季度木材调运任务的百分之七十。现在他们正在研究各种不同水势中的扎筏和流放木筏的方法，以便在四五六七等月份的压水（水头忽高忽低）和洪水季节，继续把大量木材从深山僻谷中流送出来。　（新华社）
