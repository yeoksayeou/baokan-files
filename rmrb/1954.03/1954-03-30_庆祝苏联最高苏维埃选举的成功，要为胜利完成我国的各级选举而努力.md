    Celebrating the Success of the Soviet Supreme Soviet Elections, Striving to Successfully Complete All Levels of Elections in Our Country
    Xie Juezai
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet elections were victoriously held on March 14th. The Soviet Supreme Soviet elections once again demonstrated that the election system of the Soviet socialist state, which has forever eliminated the exploitation of man by man, is the most democratic and greatest election system in the world. It not only truly realizes universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot voting, but has also become a powerful weapon for mobilizing all Soviet people to unleash their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity and to strive for the victorious completion of the great cause of communist construction. Like previous Supreme Soviet elections, this Supreme Soviet election vividly demonstrated the Soviet people's high patriotic political enthusiasm and their boundless support and trust for the Communist Party and the Soviet government, demonstrating the consolidated alliance of the Soviet working class and peasantry and the unbreakable spiritual and political friendship and unity of the Soviet peoples of all nationalities. Ninety-nine and ninety-eight hundredths percent of the total number of voters in all electoral districts participated in the voting, which means that only two people out of every ten thousand voters did not participate in the election. All voters who participated in the election unanimously elected candidates from the Communist Party and the non-party alliance.
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet elections enable millions of working people to participate more widely and actively in the management of the state, and enable the most outstanding sons and daughters to be elected into the highest state power organs, thereby further strengthening the superiority of the Soviet state system. Judging from the one thousand three hundred and forty-seven representatives elected to the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Union Council and Nationalities Council, many of them are the most outstanding workers in the Communist Party and Soviet state organs, many are labor models in industry, enterprises, transportation, and agriculture, and many are advanced scientists, writers, artists, and educators, including outstanding figures from all Soviet nationalities. The close connection between voters and representative candidates was fully demonstrated during the election process. In Moscow, Leningrad, and many other regions, voters in many factories, government offices, and collective farms directly nominated the people they supported and trusted as candidates for Supreme Soviet representatives. To thank voters for their support and trust, Soviet people's leaders who were nominated as representative candidates, such as Malenkov, Molotov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Mikoyan, and Shvernik, met with all voters at voters' meetings in their respective electoral districts and delivered speeches on ensuring their boundless loyalty and dedication of all their energy to the Party and the people, and to the glorious cause of the socialist-communist state forever. It can be inferred that those nominated as representative candidates in various localities, factories, farms, and various undertakings must have also delivered similarly solemn speeches to the voters at voters' meetings in their respective electoral districts. This situation will inevitably further strengthen the masses' supervision of the Soviet power organs and further enhance the spirit of the Soviet power organs being responsible to the people.
    The preparatory work for the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections was closely combined with the propaganda work of the Party and government policies. Whether in the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to All Voters, Male and Female Workers, Male and Female Peasants, Soviet Intellectuals, and Soviet Army and Navy Personnel," or in the speeches of candidates to voters' meetings, the rising situation of the Soviet economy, politics, and culture in all aspects after the war and the tasks for the future were fully expounded and reported, and thus the domestic and foreign policies of the Party and the government were subjected to a general test, and the Soviet people once again received broad and in-depth political education.
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet elections have also become a great force in promoting the advancement of production and construction. To welcome and celebrate the elections, the Moscow Subway workers completed the entire subway grand ring line closure and commissioning on the election holiday, the workers of the "Hammer and Sickle" steel factory launched a production competition and proposed a guarantee to complete the first quarter production plan ahead of schedule, and all the Soviet people are striving for new labor achievements in their respective posts. Why did the Soviet people demonstrate such a high degree of political and labor enthusiasm and such close unity around the Communist Party and the Soviet government in the Supreme Soviet elections? This is just as Comrade Stalin said: "...The difference between our revolution and all other revolutions is that it not only liberated the people from the tsarist system and the capitalist system and gained freedom, but also fundamentally improved the people's material life and cultural conditions. This is why our revolution is powerful and invincible." (Concise Course on the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)) That is to say: The Soviet proletarian revolution not only showed its political fruits to the people, but also showed its material fruits. This material fruit is: The continuous rise of the Soviet economy resulting from the completion of the three five-year plans implemented after the establishment and consolidation of the Soviet regime and the fourth five-year plan implemented after the victory of World War II and the implementation of the current fifth five-year plan. The production of Soviet industry and agriculture, which was destroyed during the war, has been restored and developed: The total industrial output in 1953 has increased to two and a half times the level of 1940 before the war, the machines and equipment produced in 1953 have increased to three point eight times that of 1940 before the war, and the sown area and the unit area yield of major crops have also exceeded the pre-war level. From 1949 to 1953, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 62 percent, and the national income in 1953 increased to two and a half times the pre-war level. At present, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are taking measures to accelerate the development of light industry and the food industry, and to rapidly develop all sectors of socialist agriculture, especially animal husbandry and the production of potatoes and vegetables, in order to further enhance the welfare of the Soviet people and fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. It is on such a material basis that the Soviet people give the Communist Party and the Soviet government unlimited trust and support, and show unparalleled political and production enthusiasm in the Supreme Soviet elections. It is also because of consistently following the extremely important principle of Marxism-Leninism that the people are the decisive force in history and the true creators of history, relying on the people's trust and the creative enthusiasm of millions of people, and relying on the great unity of the Party, the government, and the people as a living source of victory, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are firmly and confidently guiding the country towards the final victory of communism. This is something that the capitalist world, which has always flaunted so-called democracy but in reality only gives the people political oppression and economic exploitation, causing the people to fall into poverty, cannot hope to achieve and fundamentally cannot achieve.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, we China have not only restored the national economy and brought it to the highest level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but have also begun to implement large-scale economic construction. The working class after the democratic reform, the peasant class after the land reform, and even all the people who have undergone various social reforms, have gained political freedom and economic liberation. In order to further improve the level of material life and cultural life, the Chinese people are implementing the first five-year construction plan, confidently transitioning to a socialist society, and striving to realize the general line and general tasks of the transition period instructed by Chairman Mao, and striving to complete the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country. At the same time, the people of the whole country, whose level of organization and awareness has been greatly improved, are conducting the election of representatives to people's congresses at all levels. As of mid-March, 22 provinces and cities across the country have completed grassroots elections, and regions that have not completed them are actively carrying them out; many regions have also convened or are convening grassroots people's congresses. Representatives to county or city people's congresses above the grassroots government are also being elected, and some have already convened people's congresses. At this time, the victorious completion of the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections has extremely practical political significance for us. In our elections, except for about 1.2 or 3 percent of the total population, including landlords whose class composition has not been changed according to law, counter-revolutionaries who have been deprived of political rights according to law, and others who have been deprived of political rights according to law and mentally ill patients who do not have the right to vote and stand for election, all male and female citizens over the age of 18, regardless of nationality and race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, and length of residence, equally enjoy democratic rights. The broad masses of the people attach great importance to their rights and participate in the elections with extremely high enthusiasm. According to the statistics of 5,846 grassroots units in 27 provinces, 30 cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region across the country, the average participation rate of voters reached more than 88 percent of the total number of voters. In all areas where grassroots elections are held, the instructions of the Central Election Committee on grassroots election work are generally implemented: "Combine election work with the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline, so that all cadres can receive a profound education under the discernment of the masses. Through elections, remove those who violate laws and discipline and those who have committed serious mistakes and are extremely dissatisfied by the people from their work positions in various grassroots organizations, and elect those who are loved by the masses and who are connected with the masses to work positions in such organizations." Many labor models, outstanding workers, and outstanding employees have been nominated and elected as people's representatives, thus the lineup of grassroots government has been innovated, the work efficiency and work style have been improved, the connection between the government and the people has been further closer, and the unity of all nationalities and all democratic classes has been enhanced. In many areas, because the education of the general line of the transition period has always been implemented in the general election, the people have been further educated in patriotism, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship, which has greatly promoted the movement of patriotic grain sales, purchasing public bonds, mutual assistance and cooperation, and increasing production and practicing economy. According to incomplete statistics from 21 townships in three counties of Guoxian, Yangqu, and Fanshi in Shanxi Province, through the general election movement, 12 new agricultural production cooperatives were established, 169 mutual aid groups were developed, and the original agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups were consolidated and expanded by 3 and 103 respectively. In order to welcome the general election and for socialist construction, working people have launched production competitions one after another. The staff and workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory overfulfilled the production plan by 11 percent in half a month, and the waste rate was reduced by 24 percent compared with the original plan. "Welcome the general election with practical actions to increase production and practice economy!" "Promote advanced experience and present gifts to the general election!" These slogans have become a new driving force in many factories, mines, and agricultural production.
    These new atmospheres have created favorable conditions for further doing a good job in the election of people's congresses at all levels above the grassroots. It can be predicted that the upcoming elections and convocations of people's congresses at all levels will become a greater force for mobilizing the masses, which will show the unity of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations, show the people's high patriotic political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, and guide the people of the already victorious motherland from victory to new victories, just as the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections inspire the Soviet people to confidently move towards a communist society. Although, because we have not yet eliminated class exploitation and the construction of socialist society is still just beginning, the current social situation does not allow our country's elections to fully adopt such universal, equal, direct, and secret elections as the Soviet Union's elections, our people's democratic system belongs to the category of socialist systems, and our election system essentially has the same superiority as the Soviet election system. With the development of our country's economy, politics, and culture, and the success of large-scale economic construction with the development of heavy industry as the guideline, our country's election system will gradually transition to the completeness of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. All the brilliant achievements of the great Soviet Union are our example, and the success of the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections is of course our model. While celebrating the victorious completion of the Soviet Supreme Soviet elections, let us further learn from the Soviet Union and strive to successfully complete our country's current grassroots elections and welcome the upcoming elections at all levels.

    庆祝苏联最高苏维埃选举的成功，要为胜利完成我国的各级选举而努力
    谢觉哉
    苏联最高苏维埃选举在三月十四日胜利地举行了。苏联最高苏维埃选举再一次显示出：永远消灭了人剥削人的苏维埃社会主义国家的选举制度，是世界上最民主与最伟大的选举制度。它不仅真正实现了普遍的、平等的、直接的和无记名的投票，而且已成为动员所有苏联人民发挥其高度积极性和创造性、为胜利完成伟大共产主义建设事业而奋斗的强大武器。跟历届最高苏维埃选举一样，本届最高苏维埃选举，生动地表现了苏联人民高度爱国主义的政治热情和他们对共产党和苏联政府的无限拥护和信任，表现出苏联工人阶级和农民巩固的同盟以及苏联各民族人民精神上政治上牢不可破的友谊的团结。占所有选区选民总数百分之九十九点九八的选民参加了投票，这就是说，每一万个选民中只有两个人没有参加选举。参加选举的所有选民，都齐心一致地选举共产党和非党联盟的候选人。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举，使千百万劳动人民更广泛更积极地参加管理国家，并使最优秀的儿女被选进最高国家政权机关，从而更加加强了苏维埃国家制度的优越性。从一千三百四十七名被选进苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院的代表看来，其中有许多是共产党和苏维埃国家机关中最出色的工作者，有许多是工业、企业、运输业和农业的劳动模范，有许多是先进的科学家、文学家、艺术家和教育工作者，这中间包括所有苏联各民族的优秀人物。选举过程中充分地表现出选民与代表候选人之间的密切联系。在莫斯科、列宁格勒及其他许多地区，许多工厂、机关和集体农庄中的选民都直接把自己所拥护和信任的人提名为最高苏维埃代表候选人。而为感谢选民的拥护和信任，被提名为代表候选人的苏联人民领袖如马林科夫、莫洛托夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、米高扬、什维尔尼克等都在各自选区的选民大会上与全体选民会晤，并发表了关于保证无限忠诚地将自己全部精力永远献给党和人民、献给社会主义—共产主义国家的光荣事业的演说。可以推想到，各个地方、工厂、农庄、各种事业中被提名为代表候选人的人，一定也在各自选区的选民大会上向选民作了同样庄重的演说。这种情况，势必更加加强了群众对苏维埃政权机关的监督，更加提高了苏维埃政权机关对人民负责的精神。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举的筹备工作，是紧密与党和政府政策的宣传工作相结合进行的。无论在“苏联共产党中央委员会告全体选民、男女工人、男女农民、苏维埃知识分子和苏联陆海军人员书”中，无论在候选人对选民大会的演说中，都充分阐述与报告了战后苏联经济、政治、文化各方面高涨的情况和今后的任务，并从而使党和政府的国内政策和对外政策得到一次总的考验，使苏联人民再一次受到广泛而深入的政治教育。
    苏联最高苏维埃选举又成为推动生产建设前进的伟大力量。为迎接和庆祝选举，莫斯科地下铁道工人在选举节日实现了整个地下铁道大环行线合圈和通车，“镰刀和锤子”钢铁工厂工人展开了生产竞赛和提出了提前完成第一季度生产计划的保证，苏联全体人民都在各自岗位上争取新的劳动成就。为什么苏联人民在最高苏维埃选举中表现了这样高度的政治的劳动的积极性以及如此紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围呢？这正如斯大林同志说的：“……我国革命和其他一切革命不同的地方，就在于它不仅使人民摆脱沙皇制度，摆脱资本主义制度而获得了自由，并且把人民物质生活和文化状况根本改善了。我国革命力量雄厚而不可战胜的原因，就在这里。”（联共（布）党史简明教程）这就是说：苏维埃无产阶级革命不仅把自己的政治果实，而且把自己的物质果实显示给人民看了。这种物质果实就是：随着苏维埃政权建立与巩固以后所实行的三个五年计划和第二次世界大战胜利以后所实行的第四个五年计划的完成以及当前第五个五年计划的实施所产生的苏维埃经济的不断高涨。战争期间遭到破坏的苏联工业农业的生产恢复并发展了：一九五三年工业总产量已增为战前一九四○年水平的二倍半，一九五三年生产的机器和设备已增为战前一九四○年的三点八倍，播种面积和主要农作物的单位面积产量也已经超过了战前水平，一九四九至一九五三年期间，苏联国民收入增加了百分之六十二，一九五三年的国民收入增为战前水平的二倍半。现时苏联共产党和苏联政府正在采取措施加速发展轻工业和食品工业，迅速发展社会主义农业的一切部门，首先是饲畜业和马铃薯与蔬菜的生产，以求更进一步地增进苏联人民的福利和充分满足苏联人民不断增长的物质和文化需要。正是在这样的物质基础上，苏联人民给予共产党和苏联政府以无限的信任和拥护，而在最高苏维埃选举中表现出无比的政治的和生产的热情。也正是由于一贯遵循着马克思列宁主义关于人民是历史决定性力量、是历史真正缔造者这一极重要的原理，由于依靠着人民的信任和千百万人的创造性积极性，以及由于依靠着党、政府和人民的伟大团结一致这一胜利的活的泉源，苏联共产党和苏联政府正在坚定地和满怀信心地引导国家走向共产主义的最后胜利。这是一向标榜着所谓民主但实际仅仅给予人民以政治压迫和经济剥削、致使人民陷于贫困境地的资本主义世界所望尘莫及的和它们根本上不可能实现的。
    我们中国自解放以后，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，不仅恢复了国民经济，使之达到抗战以前的最高水平，而且已开始实行着大规模的经济建设。民主改革以后的工人阶级，土地改革以后的农民阶级，乃至经过各种社会改革的全体人民，已获得政治自由和经济翻身。为进一步提高物质生活和文化生活的水平，中国人民正在实行第一个五年建设计划，满怀信心地向着社会主义社会过渡，努力实现毛主席所指示的过渡时期的总路线总任务，为完成国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造而奋斗。与此同时，组织程度与觉悟程度已大大提高了的全国人民，正在进行各级人民代表大会的代表选举。截至三月中旬，全国已有二十二个省、市完成基层选举，未完成的地区正在积极进行；很多地区且已召开或正在召开基层的人民代表大会。基层政权以上县或市人民代表大会的代表也在选举，有的已在召开人民代表大会。正在这时候，苏联最高苏维埃选举的胜利完成，对于我们有极其现实的政治意义。我们的选举，除了约占人民总数百分之一点二、三的依法尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子、依法被剥夺政治权利的反革命分子以及其他依法被剥夺政治权利者和精神病患者没有选举权和被选举权以外，凡十八周岁以上的男女公民，不分民族和种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况和居住期限，都平等享受民主权利。广大人民都十分重视他们的权利，并以极高的热情参加了选举。根据全国二十七个省、三十个市和内蒙古自治区共五千八百四十六个基层单位的统计，参加的选民平均达到选民总数的百分之八十八以上。凡是举行基层选举的地区，一般都实现了中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示：“把选举工作与反官僚主义、反命令主义和反违法乱纪的斗争结合起来，使所有干部都能在群众的鉴别下受到一次深刻的教育。经过选举把那些违法乱纪分子和犯有严重错误而为人民所极不满意的分子从各种基层组织的工作岗位上剔除出去，把群众所爱戴的联系群众的人选到这种组织的工作岗位上来”。许多劳动模范、优秀工作者、优秀职工被提名并被选为人民代表，因而基层政权的阵容革新了，工作效能与工作作风改进了，政府与人民之间的联系进一步密切了，各民族、各民主阶级的团结增进了。许多地区由于普选中始终贯彻了过渡时期总路线的教育，人民进一步受到了爱国主义、社会主义和人民民主专政的教育，大大地推动了爱国售粮、购买公债、互助合作和增产节约的运动。据山西省崞县、阳曲、繁峙等三县二十一个乡不完全的统计，通过普选运动，新建农业生产合作社十二个，发展互助组一百六十九个，整顿与扩大了原有农业生产合作社三个及互助组一百零三个。为了迎接普选，为了社会主义建设，劳动人民纷纷展开了生产竞赛。北京人民印刷厂职工在半个月中超额完成了生产计划百分之十一，废品率比原计划降低了百分之二十四。“以增产节约的实际行动来迎接普选！”　“推广先进经验，向普选献礼！”这些口号业已成为很多厂、矿、农业生产中新的动力。
    这些新的气象，为进一步做好基层以上各级人民代表大会的选举创造了有利的条件。可以预料：即将举行和召开的各级选举和各级人民代表大会，将会成为一种更大的发动群众的力量，它将表现出各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的团结一致性，表现出人民高度爱国主义的政治热情和生产热情，引导着已经胜利的祖国人民由胜利进入新的胜利，如同苏联最高苏维埃选举之鼓舞着苏联人民满怀信心地向着共产主义社会迈进一样。虽然，由于我们还没有消灭阶级剥削，社会主义社会的建设还正在开始，当前的社会情况还不允许我国选举完全采用苏联现时这样的普遍、平等、直接和无记名的选举，但我们人民民主制度乃是属于社会主义制度的范畴，我们的选举制度实质上具备着跟苏联选举制度同样的优越性。随着我国经济、政治、文化的发展，以发展重工业为方针的大规模经济建设的成功，我国选举制度将逐步过渡到苏联那样完备。苏联的今天就是我们的明天。伟大苏联的一切光辉成就都是我们的榜样，苏联最高苏维埃选举的成功当然也是我们的楷模。让我们在庆贺苏联最高苏维埃选举胜利完成的同时，更进一步地学习苏联，为胜利完成我国当前的基层选举和迎接即将来到的各级选举而努力。
