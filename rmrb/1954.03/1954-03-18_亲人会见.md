    Relatives Meet
    By Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    On February 26th, the fourth day after the general delegation of the National People's慰问 People's Liberation Army Delegation and the fifth sub-delegation arrived in Guangzhou, hero model representatives of the delegation and hero model representatives of the Fourth Field Army gathered in a beautiful garden in southern China. It was already the season when peach blossoms were in full bloom, the grass had been covered with lush green shoots, banana leaves were waving in the wind, and banyan trees were also swaying their beard-like aerial roots, expressing their special joy on this day.
    Deng Longyou, a 59-year-old model of special class martyr dependents from Hunan Province, held Jiang Xueshan, who won the honorary titles of "Model Commander" and "Combat Hero" in the "Tashan Blockade Battle," in one hand, and Yang Yucai, a special class meritorious person of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in the other; Gao Shuyun, a 65-year-old model of special class military dependents from Hubei Province, held Wang Yushan, a Matrosov-style combat hero, in one hand, and Lu Xiangyun, a hero who drove away enemy warships with wooden boats when liberating Hainan Island, in the other; Zhang Jiying, a typesetting expert and special class labor model from Kaifeng City, Henan, and Tian Guangwen, a combat hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who had made fifteen great and small military achievements, Huang Zaiyu, a combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Gao Xiuchun, a first-class military dependent model and first-class mutual aid and cooperation model from Henan Province, as well as more than thirty heroes and models on various fronts of building and defending the motherland, all came happily and proudly.
    The warm sunshine caressed the chests of the heroes. The medals on the heroes' chests shone with golden light, symbolizing the heroes and models' contributions to the motherland, and symbolizing the honor that the people of the motherland gave to the heroes and models.
    Nearby, Shi Guiying, a special class industrial labor model from Jiujiang City and a worker in the reeling workshop of the Xingzhong纱厂, talked with her relatives about how she responded to the call of the motherland, united the workers, and greatly exceeded the production of 1953 compared with 1952; Gao Xiuchun told the most beloved people how she served as the director of an agricultural production cooperative and led the peasants to take the road of collectivization; the heroes on the sea and border defenses reported to their relatives how they strictly guarded the gate of the motherland...
    Over there, Yang Yucai, a special class meritorious person of the Chinese People's Volunteers, discussed how, for the victory of the Korean people and for the victory of defending peace for the people of the world, the volunteer soldiers fought bravely and tenaciously, and how he led a dozen soldiers to cleverly intersperse behind enemy lines during the summer counterattack last year, destroying the enemy's "Capital Division First Regiment Command Post" and cooperating with the main force to annihilate more enemies; Li Guofu and Li Shusen, hero models of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who won the title of model in the modernization and regularization study, reported their learning achievements to their relatives...
    Over here, Mother Gao patted the shoulder of this hero, touched the hand of that model, and then patted her own chest: "For our Chairman Mao, for our motherland, I sent my two sons to the volunteer army to fight American imperialism..."
    This respectable old lady mobilized the people in the town to donate 57 million yuan when donating money to buy airplanes and cannons in 1951. She is 65 years old, but when rushing to repair the embankment, she took the lead in carrying soil, carrying more than 100 catties in one load, which drove more than 200 women to complete the task of 5,300 cubic meters of earthwork. During the drought, she also mobilized more than 200 workers, cadres, and shop assistants in the town to help the peasants use 100 waterwheels to pump water day and night. She herself cranked the waterwheel for two days and two nights, rescuing more than 1,000 stones of rice. Recently, in order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction of the general line, she mobilized the masses to deposit more than 60 million yuan in the People's Bank and mobilized more than 400 people to join the cooperative.
    She said: "To be honest, for our Chairman Mao, thinking of our People's Liberation Army liberating the people, I can still work the same way even if I only eat one meal a day!..."
    The combat heroes said to her with concern: "Mom, you have to take care of your health." "Mom," what an affectionate call!
  "Children, you are young and killing the enemy in the front, for our happiness and peace, you are really the pearls and agates of our motherland! I still have a few years to be ‘active’ for our motherland!"
    Over there, a chorus of "Mom" also sounded. The heroes surrounded Mother Deng, listening to Mother Deng speak:
    "...Children, my son sacrificed in Korea, that was for the motherland, for peace, it is glorious. I sacrificed one son, but I saw thousands of sons."
    The revolutionary hero's sons love the revolutionary hero's mother, they took out their photos and gave them to Mother Deng, and wrote on them:
      "Mom, your son gloriously sacrificed for the revolution, but we all
    are willing to be your sons, and always protect you and the motherland.
                      Your son ×××"
    Mom looked at the photos and then looked at these handsome faces that were still strangers a few minutes ago.
    Mothers looked at the strong sons one by one, smiling; sons looked at their vigorous mothers, smiling.
    The heroes peeled open golden oranges and pale yellow bananas and sent them to the mothers' hands.
    Mom said: "I've eaten a lot."
    The sons said: "Eating more fruit is good for your health. Only when the sons see that Mom can eat and drink well can they feel at ease!"
    Mother Gao chewed on orange segments, and Mother Deng ate bananas.
   "Good children, you guard the front door for us, and we will take care of the housework, and socialism will definitely come faster."
     "We resolutely defend the socialist construction of the motherland, and will not allow the enemy's pig snout to extend into our garden. If the enemy comes from the land, we will eliminate him on the front line. If the enemy comes from the sea, we will bury him on the seabed!"
    This is the oath of the hero models of the People's Liberation Army, and it is also the oath of every soldier.
    Mothers, industrial labor models, and agricultural labor models listened quietly, nodding their heads: Ah! We have strength!
    Our motherland is so broad, our motherland is so rich and strong, our motherland has countless heroic teams, and the gate of our motherland is stronger than iron walls and copper walls.

    亲人会见
    本报记者　苗风
    二月二十六日，全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团总团代表和第五总分团到达广州的第四天，代表团的英雄模范代表和第四野战军的英雄模范代表，集会在祖国南方的美丽的一个花园里。这里已是桃花盛开的季节，草地已铺上了绿油油的嫩芽，芭蕉树叶正在迎风招手，榕树也摇摆着胡须般的气根，表示这一天特别的喜跃。
    湖南省特等烈属模范、五十九岁的邓隆幼邓妈妈，一手拉着在“塔山阻击战”中荣获“模范指挥员”、“战斗英雄”光荣称号的江雪山，一手拉着中国人民志愿军特等功臣杨育才；湖北省特等军属模范、六十五岁的高淑云高妈妈，一手拉着马特洛索夫式的战斗英雄王玉山，一手拉着解放海南岛时，用木船打跑敌舰的英雄鲁湘云；排字能手、河南开封市特等劳动模范张继英和曾立过大小十五个战功的中国人民解放军战斗英雄田广文，中国人民志愿军战斗英雄黄在渔和河南省一等军属模范、一等互助合作模范高秀春，还有在建设祖国、保卫祖国各个战线上的三十几个英雄模范，他们都愉快而骄傲地走来了。
    和煦的阳光，抚摸着英雄们的胸膛。英雄们的胸膛上的奖章闪着金光，金光象征着英雄模范们对祖国的贡献，金光象征着祖国人民给予英雄模范们的荣誉。
    在那旁，九江市特等工业劳动模范、兴中纱厂摇纱间工人石桂英，和亲人们畅谈着她怎样响应祖国的号召，团结工人，使一九五三年的生产大大超过一九五二年的情形；高秀春向最可爱的人述说着怎样当农业生产合作社的社长，领导农民走合作化的道路；海防、边防上的英雄们向亲人们报告他们怎样严密地守卫祖国的门户……
    在那旁，中国人民志愿军特等功臣杨育才论述着为了朝鲜人民的胜利，为了全世界人民保卫和平的胜利，志愿军的战士们，怎样英勇顽强地战斗着，他怎样在去年的夏季反击战中，带领十几个战士机智地穿插敌后，消灭敌人的“首都师一团指挥所”，配合主力歼灭了更多的敌人；在现代化、正规化学习中荣获模范称号的中国人民解放军英雄模范李国富、李树森等，向亲人报告他们学习的成绩……
    在这边，高妈妈拍拍这个英雄的肩膀，摸摸那个模范的手，又拍拍自己的胸膛：“为了咱毛主席，为了咱的祖国，我把两个儿子一起送到志愿军中，去打美帝国主义……。”
    这位令人起敬的老太太，曾在一九五一年捐献买飞机大炮款时，动员镇上的人捐献了五千七百万元。她六十五岁了，但在抢险修堤的时候，她带头挑土，一挑就是一百多斤，因而带动了二百多个妇女完成了五千三百土方的任务。抗旱的时候，她还动员镇上的工人、干部、店员二百多人，帮助农民用一百部水车日夜不停的车水。她自己就整整车了两天两夜，抢救了稻谷一千多石。最近为了实行毛主席指示的总路线，她动员群众往人民银行存款六千多万元，动员四百多人加入了合作社。
    她说：“说实在话，为了咱毛主席，想起咱解放军解放人民，我可以一天只吃一顿饭照样的干哟！……”
    战斗英雄们关怀地向她说：“妈妈，你老人家要爱护身体哟。”“妈妈”，这是多么亲切的呼唤呀！
  “孩子们，你们年轻轻地在前方杀敌，为的是咱的幸福、和平，真是咱祖国的珍珠玛瑙呀！我也还有好几年可为咱的祖国‘积极’呢！”
    在那旁，也响起一片呼唤“妈妈”的声音。英雄们围着邓妈妈，听邓妈妈说话：
    “……孩子们，我的儿子牺牲在朝鲜，那是为了祖国，为了和平，是光荣的。我牺牲了一个儿子，我却看见了千千万万的儿子。”
    革命的英雄的儿子，爱戴革命的英雄的妈妈，他们拿出自己的照片，送给邓妈妈，并在上面写着：
      “妈妈，你的儿子为革命光荣牺牲，但我们都
    愿做你的儿子，永远保卫你，保卫祖国。
                      你的儿子×××”
    妈妈看看照片，又看看这一张张在几分钟前还是陌生的英俊的脸孔。
    妈妈们看着一个个健壮的儿子，笑着；儿子们看着自己轩健的妈妈们，笑着。
    英雄们剥开金黄色的桔柑，剥开淡黄色的香蕉，送到妈妈们手里。
    妈妈说：“吃得不少了。”
    儿子们说：多吃点水果对身体好，儿子们看到妈妈能吃能喝，心里才平展啊！
    高妈妈嚼着桔瓣，邓妈妈吃着香蕉。
   “好孩子们，你们给咱把守前门，我们给收拾家务，社会主义定能来得快些。”
     “我们坚决地保卫祖国社会主义的建设，不让敌人的猪嘴伸进我们的花园里来，敌人从陆地上来，就把他消灭在前沿阵地上，敌人从海里来，就把他葬送到海底！”
    这是人民解放军英雄模范们的誓言，也是每一个战士的誓言。
    妈妈们，工业劳动模范们，农业劳动模范们静静地听着，点着头：啊！我们有力量！
    我们祖国这样宽广，我们祖国这样富强，我们祖国有着无数英雄的队伍，我们祖国的大门赛过铁壁铜墙。
