Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 24th: The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front and the Presidium of the National Assembly held a joint meeting on the 23rd and adopted a statement on the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

The statement said that the policy of forming a bloc of certain European countries to oppose other countries not only did not prevent the two world wars but also promoted the outbreak of war. Therefore, the Bulgarian people, deeply feeling their patriotic duty, hereby declare that if the Western countries truly hope to save and strengthen peace, they should forever abandon the policy of dividing Europe and driving some European countries to form blocs to oppose other European countries.

The statement went on to say that the Bulgarian people, who have been ravaged by German militarism twice in twenty years, support the Soviet policy—a policy of peace and international peaceful understanding—because only in a peaceful environment can we move steadily forward and carry out construction, because our people's democratic system of government is incompatible with any form of aggression, national oppression, and exploitation.

The statement pointed out that, under the current circumstances, European peace can only be most reliably guaranteed on the basis of the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe" draft proposed by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference. This is because this draft excludes the possibility of forming certain European country blocs to oppose other European countries, and this draft is based on the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, there is no doubt that the implementation of the Soviet "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe" draft will be a major contribution to the cause of peace.

The statement concluded by saying that for the sake of the great cause of peace and their own security interests, the Bulgarian people, in their efforts to ease international tensions and resolve all international disputes and conflicts through peaceful means and negotiations, fully support the Soviet government's proposal, are willing to participate in the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing Collective Security in Europe," and will do their best to maintain and strengthen peace in the Balkans and throughout Europe.

    保加利亚祖国阵线和国民议会发表声明
    拥护苏联关于保障全欧集体安全的建议
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社索非亚二十四日讯：保加利亚祖国阵线全国委员会常务委员会和国民议会主席团于二十三日举行了联席会议，通过关于柏林四国外长会议的声明。
    声明说，使欧洲某些国家组成一个集团来反对另一些国家的政策，不但没有阻止两次世界大战，反而促使战争爆发。因此，深深感到他们的爱国天职的保加利亚人民在这里宣布，如果西方国家真正希望拯救和加强和平，它们就应该永远放弃分裂欧洲和驱使一些欧洲国家结成集团来反对其他欧洲国家的政策。
    声明接着说，在二十年中两次受到德国军国主义蹂躏的保加利亚人民支持苏联的政策——和平与国际和平谅解的政策，因为只有在和平的环境中，才能稳步前进，进行建设，因为我们的人民民主的政府制度和任何形式的侵略、民族压迫和剥削是不能相容的。
    声明指出，在目前情况下，只有在苏联代表团在柏林会议上提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案的基础上，欧洲和平才能得到最可靠的保障。因为，这个草案排除了成立某些欧洲国家集团来反对其他欧洲国家的可能性，这个草案又是以不干涉他国内政的原则为基础的。因此，毫无疑问，实施苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案将是对和平事业的一个重大贡献。
    声明最后说，保加利亚人民为了伟大的和平事业和他们自己安全的利益，在为缓和国际紧张局势和以和平方式通过谈判来解决一切国际争端和冲突而努力，他们全力支持苏联政府的建议，愿意参加“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”并尽力维护和加强巴尔干和全欧洲的和平。
