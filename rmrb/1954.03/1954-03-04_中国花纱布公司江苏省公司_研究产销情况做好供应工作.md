China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation Jiangsu Provincial Company

Research Production and Sales, Do a Good Job of Supply Work

In order to do a good job in the second quarter's yarn and cloth variety production and supply work, the Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation held a provincial yarn and cloth production variety meeting from February 10th to 13th. Participants in this meeting included nine purchasing, wholesale, and supply stations and stores from major yarn and cloth producing areas in the province, including Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, Jiangyin, Changshu, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, and Nanjing.

Jiangsu Province is a major cotton yarn and cloth producing area. Currently, it supplies over twenty provinces and cities, reaching as far as Xinjiang, Sichuan, and the northeastern provinces, playing a significant role in adjusting the variety of colors and patterns. This meeting primarily focused on studying the province's second quarter yarn and cloth production plan, the varieties of yarn and cloth to be produced, and issues related to thread product production. In particular, the meeting analyzed and researched the varieties of yarn and cloth to be produced in detail from the perspectives of raw materials, sales channels, and machine performance, so as to produce more beautiful and durable cotton cloth suitable for people to make spring and summer clothing in the second quarter. At the same time, the meeting further studied the potential production capacity of yarn and cloth in the province.

Through this meeting, a provincial second-quarter yarn and cloth balance plan was drafted to closely integrate production and sales. According to preliminary estimates, the cotton cloth produced in the second quarter of this year will increase by about 70 percent compared to the same period last year. For example, the production of various poplins will double compared to the second quarter of last year. In addition, in order to exchange experience in the production of varieties in various regions, a summer light-colored cloth sample exhibition was held, displaying more than 4,000 kinds of light-colored cotton cloth samples, many of which are new varieties for 1954.
