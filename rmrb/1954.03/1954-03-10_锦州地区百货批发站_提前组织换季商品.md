Jinzhou Area Department Store Wholesale Station

    Organizes Off-Season Goods in Advance

The Jinzhou Area Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company, in conjunction with the general line study and inspection work, found that the main shortcomings in organizing off-season goods in the first half of last year were neglecting rural supply and importing goods too late. Therefore, before formulating this year's purchasing plan, it organized groups to go deep into Fuxin, Xingcheng, Jinxi, Yixian and other places to investigate the needs of the people, and in combination with the 1953 sales performance and daily accumulated data, formulated the first and second quarter purchasing plans in advance. When ordering goods, attention was also paid to the increase in people's purchasing power and the characteristics of rural needs, and the variety and quantity of goods were increased. The first and second quarter purchase plans included fine yarn floral cloth, light floral cloth, socks, vests, shirts, underpants, etc., which are needed for the change of seasons. Because rural women like thick and brightly colored cloth and socks, a large number of coarse-thread socks and various cloths produced in Northeast China were organized this year. In the first quarter of this year, more than 25,000 bolts of cloth of various colors were organized to be dyed by local dyeing factories.

    锦州地区百货批发站
    提前组织换季商品
    中国百货公司锦州地区批发站，在结合总路线学习检查工作中，发现去年上半年在组织换季商品上的主要缺点是忽视了农村供应，进货时间太晚。因此，在制订今年的进货计划前，曾组织小组深入阜新、兴城、锦西、义县等地，调查了人民的需要，并结合一九五三年销售实绩和日常累积的资料，提前制订了第一、二季度的进货计划。在订进货计划时还注意了人民购买力的提高，和农村需要的特点，增加了商品的种类和数量。在第一、二季度进货计划中，包括了换季所需的细纱花布、浅花布、袜子、背心、衬衣、衬裤等。由于农村妇女们喜欢厚实而色泽鲜艳的布和袜子，所以今年大量组织了东北出产的粗线袜子和各种布。今年第一季度就组织当地加染厂加染二万五千多匹各色布匹。
