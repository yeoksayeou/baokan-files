Northwest Industry Advancing Along the General Line
By Our Correspondent Zhang Chao

	I. Weak Foundation, Rich Potential

The most obvious characteristic left by the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society in the economic structure of the Northwest was the extreme weakness of the industrial base. Despite the vast Northwest Plateau possessing rich reserves, the imperialists, who had long controlled China's economic lifeline, were primarily interested in dumping large quantities of their own goods and investing first in coastal areas for the purpose of aggression and plunder; the reactionary ruling class of China was, of course, wholeheartedly attached to its masters and had neither the interest nor the power to develop the Northwest. Thus, the Northwest became a deformed region, rich underground but poor above ground. The fate of oil and cotton best illustrates this characteristic left by the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society: The oil reserves in the Northwest originally ranked first in the country, but due to the predatory nature of the oil extraction policy under the control of American and British imperialists, the oil fields were not protected, and the refining equipment was not balanced with the extraction capacity, resulting in poor refining. As a result, Yumen Oil Mine, the largest oil mine in the country, often dumped crude oil into river embankments, letting the water wash it away. Shaanxi was a nationally renowned cotton-producing area, but because the foundation of the Northwest textile industry was weak, most of the cotton had to be transported to coastal areas for spinning and weaving in the past, and then the cloth could be transported back. People often sighed:
	“In places that produce oil, kerosene lamps cannot be lit; in places that produce cotton, cloth cannot be bought.”

By the time the Northwest was liberated (1949), the remaining industry had suffered another serious destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the scene was even more miserable. According to investigations in the early days of liberation, industry accounted for less than 5 percent of the Northwest's national economy, and only 2 percent of the country's total industrial output value.

	II. Three Years of Recovery, One Year of Development

Since liberation, under the conditions of a weak industrial base and rich resource reserves, the Northwest industry has achieved remarkable results after three years of recovery and the first year of the Five-Year Plan. Based on the specific conditions of the Northwest, industrial construction focuses on oil, electricity, and coal, and correspondingly develops light industry, mainly the textile industry, and gradually carries out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry. By 1953, the main signs of industrial development were: the proportion of industrial output value in the Northwest's national economy had increased from less than 5 percent in the early days of liberation to nearly 17 percent, becoming a leading force in the Northwest's economic construction, changing the backward face of this plateau every moment.

The achievements of Northwest industry are concentrated in two aspects: capital construction and industrial production.

One, capital construction: During the three-year recovery period, the investment in capital construction accounted for 58 percent of the total investment in the region's national economy (excluding railway construction), and in 1953 it rose to 73 percent. The investment in this year was one and a half times the total investment in the previous three years. This means that the capital construction of industry has been raised to the primary position in the national economy and is gradually increasing. During the three-year recovery period, more than half of these investments were used for reconstruction and expansion, and in 1953 most of them were used for new construction projects. Taking oil and textile projects as examples: In the past four years, the state's investment in oil drilling and exploration accounted for more than 70 percent of the investment in Northwest heavy industry; the investment in 1953 increased more than seven times compared with 1950, and the number of exploration personnel increased greatly. In 1953, the area of geological surveys completed increased thirteen times compared with 1950, and the footage of drilling increased eight times, laying a solid foundation for the Northwest oil industry. In the past four years, the investment in textiles accounted for more than 90 percent of the investment in light industry. New textile factories are constantly appearing in cotton-producing areas along the Longhai Railway. The completion of new factories such as the state-owned No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Factories and the Xinjiang "July 1st" Textile Factory has increased the number of spindles in the Northwest by one and a half times compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of looms has increased threefold.

Two, industrial production: During the three-year recovery period, the output of various major products has exceeded the highest level before the Anti-Japanese War, and in 1953 it exceeded the level of the previous three years. For example, comparing 1953 with 1950 (the first year of the three-year recovery period), oil increased by 144 percent, electricity increased by 376 percent, coal increased by 327 percent, cotton cloth increased by 3168 percent, and flour increased by 782 percent; the total industrial output value during the same period increased by nearly two times. Taking oil and textiles as examples again: From November 1953, the crude oil produced by Yumen Oil Mine has begun to be transported eastward in large quantities to supply the refineries in Northeast and East China for refining finished products to supply the national industrial production and transportation industry. Before this, due to insufficient supply of crude oil, work was often stopped waiting for materials, and a large amount of finished oil products used in the country had to be imported from abroad. Later, Soviet expert Comrade Mosiyev suggested transporting crude oil eastward, and this important suggestion was finally adopted quickly. This marks the beginning of an independent development path for China's oil industry. The achievements of textile production can be explained by another situation: For example, according to the population distribution ratio, in 1948, the cloth produced in the Northwest, on average, about 60 people in the entire region could share one piece of cloth, and in 1953, about 15 people could share one piece of cloth. The quality of yarn and cloth has also improved a lot. The "Alliance" brand 12-pound cloth produced by the state-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory and various beautiful printed fabrics produced by the new Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, which could not be self-printed in the past, are highly praised by the people of the Northwest.

	III. Following What, Relying on What

First of all, the Northwest industry in the past four years has been healthily restored and developed by following the general line of the state during the transition period, the basic tasks of the state's first Five-Year Plan, and the policy of "focusing on key construction and advancing steadily," combined with the specific conditions of the Northwest, especially in the two basic links of "concentrating efforts to develop heavy industry" and "ensuring the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy." Based on the existing foundation and resources of the Northwest, in the past four years, major efforts have been concentrated on restoring and developing heavy industry, mainly the fuel industry. From the perspective of the proportion of output value, the output value of heavy industry in 1953 increased by 778 percent compared with 1950, while the output value of light industry during the same period increased by only 461 percent, that is, the growth rate of heavy industry greatly exceeded the growth rate of light industry. From the perspective of the investment ratio of capital construction, the investment in the fuel industry accounted for nearly 90 percent of the total industrial capital construction investment in the past four years, that is, heavy industry investment took the first place. At the same time, light industry has been correspondingly developed, this is one aspect; on the other hand, the proportion of socialist components is also steadily increasing. The output value of socialist industry in 1953 increased by 605 percent compared with 1950, and the proportion of output value increased from 19 percent in 1950 to 46 percent in 1953; during the same period, the output value of private capitalist industry increased by 19 percent, and the proportion of output value decreased from 68 percent in 1950 to just over 27 percent in 1953.

But this does not mean that Northwest industry has not taken some detours. Especially at the beginning of the recovery, varying degrees of blind advancement or simultaneous advancement occurred in certain industrial sectors, resulting in uncoordinated steps and unsalable products of some factories and mines. After the inspection and rectification of the Northwest Industrial Conference in 1951, the above-mentioned phenomena were overcome, and the focus of recovery and development was determined to be oil, electricity, coal, and textiles, the advanced base of industry was consolidated, and the principle of proportionate development of industry was promoted, strictly advancing along the general line.

Secondly, the healthy development of Northwest industry is also due to the implementation of the policy of "relying on the working class to do a good job in production" as instructed by Chairman Mao, which has rapidly improved labor productivity. As Lenin pointed out, the improvement of labor productivity "is, in the final analysis, the most important condition for ensuring the victory of the new social system." The number of modern industrial workers in the Northwest was originally small, and the technical level was limited. For this reason, the state actively cultivated the original workers on the one hand, and vigorously trained new workers on the other hand, to adapt to the speed of industrial development. After the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the democratic reform, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the two increase production and practice economy movements, as well as the universal establishment of factory management committees and employee representative conferences in various factories and mines, the implementation of democratic management, and the improvement of workers' awareness of being "masters of the country," thereby improving workers' labor productivity. According to statistics from state-owned key factories and mines, the increase in labor productivity in 1953 was 224 percent of that in 1950, of which oil reached 108 percent. Especially in the two increase production and practice economy movements carried out on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement (1952 and 1953), many model figures and creative deeds emerged. The "patrol inspection system" created by Wang Kuan's group in Yumen Oil Mine, the record of reducing yarn breakage rate created by Wang Yuzhen's group in the state-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the "steel wire machine work method" created by Meng Tianlu, a worker in the state-owned No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, the "Jia Er doffing method" created by the doffing workers of the second platoon of Jia class in the Xinqin Textile Factory, and the "mold casting operation method" created by Li Zixiang, the foreman of the foundry in the Northwest No. 1 Machinery Factory, etc., are major contributions of the Northwest workers to the country's industrial construction. They are driving the vast number of employees with this pioneering spirit to continue to work hard to promote the country's socialist industrialization.

Thirdly, the healthy development of Northwest industry is also inseparable from improving business management, especially planning management. After entering the three-year recovery period, planning institutions were gradually established from the industrial leadership agencies at all levels in the Northwest to the factories and mines, and planning management was implemented. The understanding of leading cadres at all levels that planning management is the central link of business management has also changed from unclear to clear, from not paying attention to paying attention, and from partial to comprehensive. Planning management in 1950 was only stopped at the compilation and summary, in 1951 it began to focus on output and major technical and economic quotas, in 1952 it paid attention to quality and cost, as well as mobilizing employees to discuss and check the implementation of the plan. In 1953, the focus was on promoting operation plans. At the same time, the original records were gradually rectified, and the statistical system was improved to facilitate the compilation and inspection of plans. In 1953, due to further improvement of planning management, the total industrial output value overfulfilled the plan; capital construction also completed more than 95 percent of the workload, which was better than in previous years.

However, the progress of improving business management and strengthening planning management cannot adapt to the requirements of industrial development. The planning management work of most units (mainly local industries) is still relatively weak. Some units do not pay enough attention to strengthening technical management, improving product quality and project quality, resulting in serious phenomena such as low quality, many accidents, rework waste, and high costs. The essence of these shortcomings is that the industrial leadership level is still behind industrial development, and rapidly improving the leadership level has become the key to further development of Northwest industry.

Fourthly, the training and promotion of industrial cadres and technical personnel is a decisive factor in promoting Northwest industry. Comrade Stalin's famous saying "cadres decide everything" has been confirmed here again. In the past four years, the Northwest Party, government, and industrial leading agencies have made great efforts in this regard and have generally adopted three methods to solve the extremely difficult cadre problem: First, vigorously cultivate the active workers in the existing factories and mines. According to incomplete statistics, the state-owned factories and mines alone have promoted more than 800 worker cadres, and in accordance with the principle of "relying on old factories to build new factories," a group of cadres have been transferred from the original factories and mines to the newly built factories and mines; second, ideological transformation and technical training have been carried out on the original technical personnel and old intellectuals. In the past four years, eight secondary technical schools have been opened one after another, and some factories have also set up apprentice schools; third, a large number of excellent cadres have been transferred from other work positions to industrial positions as the leading backbone of industry, which has greatly strengthened the leadership of industry.

Of course, the training and training of industrial cadres and technical personnel is far from enough to meet the needs of future industrial construction, which is a problem that needs to be further solved.

	IV. Bright Prospects, Arduous Tasks

The Northwest region will be an important base for China's socialist industrialization, with bright prospects. First of all, because the Northwest has rich reserves, especially the resources needed for heavy industry. According to existing data estimates, oil accounts for more than 90 percent of the country's total reserves, distributed in a narrow strip of land more than 2,000 kilometers long from the west to the Sino-Soviet border, the east to the middle reaches of the Yellow River, north of the Qinling Mountains, and south of the Daqing Mountains. In the middle is the oil field area centered on Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu, with large reserves, which is currently the first oil industry base in the country; at the western end is the oil field area centered on Usu Oil Mine in Xinjiang, with the best quality; at the eastern end is the oil field area centered on Yanchang Oil Mine in Shaanxi, with the longest history of exploitation; new oil fields are still being explored. Coal mines account for the second largest share of the country's total reserves, distributed in vast areas such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. This means that the rich reserves of oil and coal will fully supply the fuel needed for industry in the Northwest and the whole country. The Northwest also has huge potential surface power resources. The long and rapid Yellow River and some tributaries can be used for hydroelectric power generation. This means that Northwest industry will get cheap and powerful power from here. The resources of cotton, wool, leather, etc. needed by light industry are also abundant. According to the existing output, the annual cotton output is about 2 million dan. The "Jingwei Cotton" produced in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, is a nationally renowned high-quality cotton textile raw material, and animal husbandry also ranks second in the country. The annual wool output is about 500,000 dan, and the quality is also high. In addition, the sales are wide, the raw material production area is moderate (close to the transportation line), and the climate is suitable (the humidity in the Northwest throughout the year is about 50-80 percent, and the temperature is also moderate). Therefore, the Northwest textile industry also has corresponding development conditions. In addition, there are non-ferrous metal deposits such as copper, tungsten, tin, and antimony, non-metallic minerals such as natural alkali, salt, sulfur, gypsum, and asbestos, and large forest areas. These are indispensable resources for industry.

The railway network, which has a decisive influence on the growth of industrial construction, is continuing to extend. After the Baoji-Tianshui Road and Tianshui-Lanzhou Road in the western section of the Longhai Railway were opened to traffic one after another, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road and Baoji-Chengdu Road were successively started. These railways have not only greatly promoted or will greatly promote the industrial construction of the Northwest, but will also link the economic construction of the Northwest and the whole country.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest, united around the Communist Party and the working class, are and will further support the industrial construction of the Northwest. In particular, relying on the solid worker-peasant alliance of the working class and more than 29 million peasants is the fundamental guarantee for the development and greater development of Northwest industry.

The tasks facing the working class and people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are extremely arduous. That is to continue to follow the general line of the state during the transition period and the first Five-Year Plan, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, on the basis of the major victories achieved in the past four years, and use the superior conditions of the Northwest to further develop Northwest industry. At the same time, continue to improve the business management of existing industries, improve the level of leadership, and vigorously cultivate industrial construction talents. In 1954 alone, the Northwest region will concentrate its main efforts on geological exploration to further understand and grasp the reserves of resources such as oil, coal, ferrous metals, and non-ferrous metals to prepare conditions for the development of heavy industry. At the same time, light industry will also be developed correspondingly this year, and the newly built state-owned No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory will also be put into production. By the time the first Five-Year Plan is completed, the oil in heavy industry will increase several times compared with 1953, and the spindles in light industry will double.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest have full confidence and strength to steadily build this area of more than 3.3 million square kilometers into a powerful base for the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

    沿着总路线前进的西北工业
    本报记者　张　潮
      一、基础薄弱，蕴藏丰富
    半殖民地半封建社会遗留在西北经济结构中的最显明的特征，便是工业基础的极端薄弱。尽管辽阔的西北高原有着丰富的蕴藏量，可是曾经长期控制中国经济命脉的帝国主义者为了达到侵略和掠夺的目的，它的兴趣首先在于大量倾销本国的商品，并首先就近投资于沿海地区；中国的反动统治阶级当然一心依附其主子，既无兴趣也无力量开发西北。就这样，使西北成为一个地下富、地上穷的畸形区域。石油和棉花的命运，最足以说明半殖民地半封建社会所遗留的这个特征：西北的石油蕴藏量，本来占全国第一位，可是由于在美、英帝国主义者控制下的采油政策的掠夺性，油田得不到保护，炼油设备与采油能力不平衡，炼制不精。弄得全国最大的油矿——玉门油矿常把原油倾到河坝里，让水冲走。陕西本是全国闻名的产棉区，由于西北纺织工业基础薄弱，过去却要把大部棉花运到沿海地区去纺织，然后才能运进布匹来。人们常常叹气说：
  “出石油的地方点不起煤油，出棉花的地方买不起布匹。”
    临到西北解放的时候（一九四九年），仅存的工业又遭到了国民党反动派一次严重的破坏，其景象就更加凄惨了。根据解放初期的调查，工业在西北国民经济中所占的比重还不到百分之五，而在全国工业产值中则只占百分之二。
      二、三年恢复，一年发展
    解放以来，在工业基础薄弱、资源蕴藏丰富的条件下，经过了三年恢复时期和五年建设计划第一年的努力，西北工业已经获得了显著的成绩。根据西北具体情况，工业建设以石油、电力、煤炭为重点，相应地发展以纺织工业为主的轻工业，逐步进行对资本主义工业的社会主义改造。到一九五三年，工业发展的主要标志是：工业产值在西北国民经济中所占的比重，已由解放初期不到百分之五增长到近百分之十七，成为西北经济建设中的一支领导力量，每时每刻地改变着这个高原的落后面貌。
    西北工业的成绩，集中表现在基本建设和工业生产两个方面。
    一、基本建设：在三年恢复时期中，基本建设的投资额占全区国民经济总投资额的百分之五十八
  （还不包括铁路建设），一九五三年又上升为百分之七十三，这一年投资额相当于前三年投资总和的一倍半。这就是说，工业的基本建设被提到了国民经济中的首要地位，并在逐步增长。在三年恢复时期，这些投资一半以上用于改建和扩建，一九五三年则大部用于新建工程。以石油和纺织工程为例：四年来国家在石油钻探和勘查方面的投资额，占西北重工业投资额的百分之七十以上；一九五三年的投资额又比一九五零年增加了七倍多，勘探人员大大增加。一九五三年完成地质调查的面积比一九五零年增加了十三倍，钻井进尺增加了八倍，给西北石油工业打下了雄厚的基础。四年来纺织投资额则占轻工业投资额的百分之九十以上，在陇海路沿线的产棉地区内，新型的纺织工厂正在不断出现。国营第一、第二棉纺织厂及新疆“七一”纺织厂等新厂的建成，使西北现有纺锭比解放初期增加了一倍半，布机则增加了三倍。
    二、工业生产：在三年恢复时期中，各项主要产品即已超过了抗日战争以前的最高水平，一九五三年又超过了前三年的水平。如以一九五三年与一九五零年（三年恢复时期的第一年）比较，石油增长百分之一四四，电力增长百分之三七六，煤炭增长百分之三二七，棉布增长百分之三一六八，面粉增长百分之七八二；同期的工业总产值则增加了近两倍。再以石油和纺织为例：从一九五三年十一月起，玉门油矿生产的原油，已开始大量东运，供给东北、华东的炼油厂炼制成品，以供应全国的工业生产和运输业。在此以前，由于原油供应不足，时常停工待料，而国内用的大量石油成品又必须从国外输入。后来，苏联专家莫谢耶夫同志曾建议原油东运，这个重要的建议终于很快被采用了。这就标志着我国石油工业开始走上独立发展的道路。纺织生产的成果，则可以用另外一种情况来说明：例如按人口分配比例计算，一九四八年西北出产的布匹，平均全区大约六十多个人才能分到一匹布，到了一九五三年，大约十五个人就能分到一匹布了。纱布的质量也提高了不少，国营第一棉纺织厂出产的“联盟牌”十二磅的布和新西北印染厂出产的过去不能自印的各种优美花布，很受西北人民的赞扬。
    三、遵循什么，依靠什么
    首先，四年来的西北工业，是遵循着国家在过渡时期的总路线、国家第一个五年计划的基本任务和“重点建设、稳步前进”的方针，结合西北具体情况，健康地恢复和发展起来的，特别表现在“集中力量发展重工业”、“保证国民经济中社会主义成分的比重稳步增长”这两个基本环节上。根据西北的现有基础和资源，四年来即集中主要力量恢复和发展了以燃料工业为主的重工业。从产值的比重来看，一九五三年的重工业产值比一九五零年增长了百分之七七八，同期的轻工业产值则只增长了百分之四六一，即重工业的增长速度大大超过了轻工业的增长速度。从基本建设的投资比重来看，四年来燃料工业的投资就占全部工业基本建设投资的几近百分之九十，即重工业投资占了首位。与此同时，轻工业仍相应地得到了发展，这是一方面；另一方面，社会主义成分的比重也在稳步增长，一九五三年社会主义工业产值比一九五零年增长了百分之六零五，产值比重由一九五零年的百分之一九增长到一九五三年的百分之四六；同期私人资本主义工业产值增长了百分之一九，产值比重则由一九五零年的百分之六十八降至一九五三年的百分之二七强。
    但这并不是说，西北工业没有走过一些弯路。特别是在开始恢复的时候，某些工业部门中曾发生过程度不同的盲目冒进或齐头并进的现象，以致一度形成步伐失调和某些厂矿产品滞销。经过一九五一年西北工业会议的检查和整顿，才克服了上述现象，确定了以石油、电力、煤炭和纺织为恢复和发展的重点，巩固了工业的前进基地，并促使工业按比例发展的原则，严格沿着总路线前进。
    其二，西北工业的健康发展，又是由于执行了毛主席所指示的“依靠工人阶级搞好生产”的方针，迅速提高了劳动生产率。正如列宁所指出的，劳动生产率的提高，“归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最主要的条件”。西北现代产业工人本来为数不多，技术水平也有限，为此，国家一方面对原有工人加以积极培养，一方面大力训练新工人，以求与工业发展速度相适应。经过抗美援朝运动、镇压反革命运动、民主改革、“三反”“五反”运动和两次增产节约运动，以及由于各厂矿普遍建立了工厂管理委员会与职工代表会议，实行了民主管理，提高了工人的“国家主人翁”觉悟，从而提高了工人的劳动生产率。根据国营重点厂矿的统计，一九五三年劳动生产率的提高为一九五零年的百分之二二四，其中石油一项则达百分之一零八。特别是在“三反”运动基础上开展起来的两次增产节约运动中（一九五二年和一九五三年），涌现了不少模范人物和创造事迹。玉门油矿王宽小组创造的“巡回检查制”，国营第一棉纺织厂王玉珍小组创造的降低断头率纪录，国营第四棉纺织厂工人孟天禄创造的“钢丝机工作法”，新秦纺织厂甲班二排落纱工人创造的“甲二落纱法”，西北第一机械厂铸工工长李紫祥创造的“铸型操作法”等等，是西北工人对国家工业建设的重大贡献。他们正在以这种首创精神，带动广大职工，继续为推进国家的社会主义工业化而努力。
    其三，西北工业的健康发展，又是与改进经营管理特别是计划管理分不开的。在进入三年恢复时期后，从西北各级工业领导机构直到厂矿，都逐步建立了计划机构，推行计划管理。各级领导干部对于计划管理是经营管理的中心环节的认识，也随着由不明确进到明确，由不重视进到重视，由局部进到全面。一九五零年的计划管理还只是停止在编制和总结上，一九五一年开始抓产量与主要技术经济定额，一九五二年进到注意质量和成本，以及发动职工群众讨论计划与检查计划的执行。一九五三年则着重推行作业计划。与此同时，逐步整顿了原始纪录，健全了统计制度，以利编制与检查计划。一九五三年由于进一步改进了计划管理，工业生产总值超额完成计划；基本建设也完成了工作量百分之九十五以上，比历年情况都好。
    但是改进经营管理，加强计划管理的进度还不能适应工业发展的要求，多数单位（主要是地方工业）的计划管理工作还比较薄弱，有些单位对于加强技术管理、提高产品质量和工程质量等还重视不够，以致造成质量低、事故多、返工浪费和成本高等严重现象。这些缺点的实质是工业领导水平还落在工业发展的后面，迅速提高领导水平已成为西北工业进一步发展的关键。
    其四，工业干部和技术人员的培养与提拔，是推进西北工业的一个决定因素，斯大林同志的“干部决定一切”的名言在这里又得到了证实。四年来，西北党、政和工业领导机关在这方面作了很大努力，大体上采取了三个办法来解决极端困难的干部问题：一是大力培养现有厂矿中的工人积极分子，根据不完全的统计，单是国营厂矿就提拔了八百多名工人干部，并根据“依靠老厂、建设新厂”的原则，从原有厂矿中输送了一批干部到新建厂矿中去；二是对原有技术人员和旧知识分子进行了思想改造和技术训练，四年来先后开办了八个中等技术学校，有些工厂还附设了艺徒学校；三是从其他工作岗位上抽调大批优秀干部到工业岗位上去，作为工业的领导骨干，大大加强了工业的领导力量。
    当然，工业干部和技术人员的培养与训练，还远不够今后工业建设的需要，这是一个尚待进一步解决的问题。
    四、远景灿烂，任务艰巨
    西北地区将是我国社会主义工业化的一个重要基地，远景灿烂。首先因为西北有丰富的蕴藏量，特别是重工业所需要的资源。根据现有资料估计，石油占全国总储量的百分之九十以上，分布在西至中苏边界、东至黄河中段、秦岭以北、大青山以南这一长达两千多公里的狭长地带。中部有以甘肃玉门油矿为中心的油田区，蕴藏量很大，是目前全国第一个石油工业基地；西端有以新疆乌苏油矿为中心的油田区，其品质最优；东端有以陕西延长油矿为中心的油田区，其开采历史最长；新的油田尚在继续勘查中。煤矿占全国总储量的第二位，分布在陕西、甘肃、宁夏等广大地区。这就是说，石油和煤炭的丰富蕴藏，将充分供应西北和全国的工业所需的燃料。西北还有潜力巨大的地面动力资源，漫长的湍急的黄河和某些支流，可以利用为水力发电。这就是说，西北工业将从这里得到廉价而又强大的动力。轻工业所需要的棉花、羊毛、皮革等资源也很充足，根据现有产量看，棉花年产量约二百万担左右。陕西关中出产的“泾渭棉”，为全国闻名的优良棉纺织原料，畜牧业也占全国第二位，羊毛年产量约五十余万担，品质也高，加上销路广阔，原料产地适中（靠近交通线），气候适宜（西北全年湿度约在百分之五十—八十之间，气温也平和），因此，西北纺织工业也有着相应的发展条件。此外，尚有铜、钨、锡、锑等有色金属矿藏，天然碱、食盐、硫磺、石膏、石棉等非金属矿产和大片的森林地带。这些都是工业上不可缺少的资源。
    对工业建设的增长具有决定影响的铁路网，正在继续延伸。陇海路西段的宝（鸡）天（水）路和天（水）兰（州）路先后通车后，兰（州）新（疆）路和宝（鸡）成（都）相继先后动工。这些铁路不仅已在或将大大促进西北的工业建设，并且将把西北和全国的经济建设联结起来。
    团结在共产党和工人阶级周围的西北各族人民，正在并将进一步支援西北的工业建设。特别是依靠工人阶级与二千九百多万农民的巩固的工农联盟，是西北工业获得发展和更大发展的根本保证。
    摆在西北工人阶级和各族人民面前的任务是极为艰巨的。这就是继续遵循国家在过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年建设计划，在中央人民政府和毛主席的统一领导下，在四年来所取得的重大胜利的基础上，利用西北的优越条件，进一步发展西北工业。同时继续改进现有工业的经营管理，提高领导水平，大力培养工业建设人材。在一九五四年一年内，西北地区将集中主要力量进行地质勘探，以求进一步了解和掌握石油、煤炭、黑色金属及有色金属等资源的蕴藏情况，为发展重工业准备条件。与此同时，今年还相应地发展轻工业，新建的国营第三棉纺织厂也将投入生产。在第一个五年计划完成时，重工业中的石油将增长为一九五三年的数倍，轻工业中的纺锭将增长一倍。
    西北各族人民，在共产党和工人阶级领导下，完全有信心也有力量，把这个面积三百三十多万平方公里的地区稳步地建设成为祖国的社会主义工业化的强大基地。
