    Rapid Industrial Construction in Harbin

    In recent years, Harbin's industrial construction has developed rapidly, transforming it from a consumer city into a production city, and from a commercial city into an industrial city. Before liberation, Harbin only had some agricultural processing factories, such as flour mills, oil mills, wineries, cigarette factories, and sawmills. After liberation, during the period of national economic recovery, Harbin saw the emergence of nationally renowned light industries such as the Harbin Flax Textile Factory and the Harbin Woolen Mill. In the first year of the national Five-Year Plan, the city had already completed over 1.1 million square meters of basic construction area, which is about one-seventh of the city's original building area, and greater than the total construction of the past three years. Two-thirds of the completed investment was in heavy industry construction.

    In the second year of the Five-Year Plan, Harbin's industrial construction scale is even more immense. Heavy industry construction, accounting for more than 60% of the city's total basic construction investment for the year, includes China's largest and most precise Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Manufacturing Factory. After the end of this year, it will produce various electric meters for generators and transformer equipment, complete sets of automobile electric meters, and precision instruments such as potentiometer instruments that China could not manufacture in the past. Simultaneously with the construction of this precision factory, two exceptionally large-scale heavy industry factories—the Harbin Boiler Manufacturing Factory and the Steam Turbine Manufacturing Factory—are being prepared for construction.

    With the development of economic construction, the city's population has also grown rapidly, increasing from 750,000 at the time of liberation to 1.2 million. Based on economic development, and to meet the material and cultural needs of the people, Harbin has established various universities, specialized colleges, and technical schools in recent years, and public cultural welfare facilities have also grown accordingly. These include: the Institute of Civil Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin Medical University, Northeast Agricultural College, Forestry College, Teachers' College, Harbin Electrical Industry School, Harbin Industrial Technology School, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Harbin Foreign Languages ​​Specialized School. In addition, some new technical schools will be built this year, including the Harbin Civil Engineering School, which will train civil engineering, plumbing, electrical, and surveying technicians for basic construction, and the Harbin Mechanized Agricultural School, which will train tractor drivers and agricultural machinery technicians. Young men and women from all over the country have already begun or will soon begin to study new scientific knowledge in these new types of schools. In recent years, the city has also built many sanatoriums, rest homes, clubs, and employee dormitories. (Lin Xia)

    哈尔滨市工业建设迅速发展
    几年来，哈尔滨市工业建设迅速发展，已经由一座消费城市变成了生产城市，由一座商业城市变成了工业城市。解放前，哈尔滨市只有一些农业加工的工厂，如制粉、制油、酿酒、制烟、锯木厂等。解放后，在国家经济恢复时期，哈尔滨出现了全国闻名的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂、哈尔滨毛织厂等轻工业。在国家五年计划的第一年中，全市已经完成了一百一十余万平方公尺的基本建设面积，约等于全市原有建筑面积的七分之一，大于过去三年的建筑总和。完成的投资额中三分之二是属于重工业建设。
    在五年建设计划的第二个年度里，哈尔滨市的工业建设规模更加巨大，占该市全年基本建设投资总额百分之六十以上的重工业建设中，包括有我国最大的最精密的哈尔滨电表仪器制造厂，在今年年末以后，它将生产出发电机和变电设备的各种电表、全套的汽车电表以及我国过去不能制造的电位差仪表等精密仪器，和这座精密工厂兴建的同时，还有两座规模异常庞大的重工业工厂——哈尔滨锅炉制造厂和汽轮机制造厂，正在筹备兴建。
    随着经济建设的发展，城市人口也迅速增长，全市人口已由解放时七十五万人增至一百二十万人。在经济发展的基础上，为适应人民的物质和文化生活的需要，几年来，哈尔滨市内兴办了各种大学、专科学校和技术学校，公共文化福利设施也随之增长。其中包括有：中国科学院土木研究所、哈尔滨医科大学、东北农学院、林学院、师范专科学校、哈尔滨电气工业学校、哈尔滨工业技术学校、哈尔滨工业大学、哈尔滨外国语专门学校等。另外，今年还要修建一些新的技术学校，包括有培养基本建设的土木、水暖、电气、测量技术人员的哈尔滨土木工程学校，培养拖拉机手和农业机械技术人员的哈尔滨机械化农业学校。来自各地的青年男女，已经或即将在这些新型的学校里学习新的科学知识。几年来，该市还修建了不少的疗养院、休养所、俱乐部和职工宿舍等。　（林侠）
