Agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei's cotton-producing areas are leading farmers to revise their cotton planting plans and expand the cotton planting area according to national needs.

Hebei Province plans to sow 16 million mu of cotton this year, with an average yield of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu, under the premise of not affecting grain production increases. The total output is expected to reach 640 million jin, an increase of 39.1 percent over last year. In implementing the cotton planting plan, various localities generally combine the promotion of the General Line with specific explanations of the state's policy of planned purchase and supply of grain and the cotton-grain price ratio, carefully calculating income accounts for farmers, etc., to enhance farmers' understanding and dispel their concerns. County and district cadres first help agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and Party and League members to revise their cotton planting plans, and then use them to lead general farmers to expand cotton fields. According to statistics from 61 agricultural production cooperatives in five counties including Shenze, Xinle, and Dingxian, the original plan was to plant 3,455 mu, but after revising the plan, it increased to 4,328 mu. The 288 agricultural production cooperatives in Anguo County plan to increase cotton production by 820,000 jin, with an average increase of 60 jin of seed cotton per mu of cotton field compared to last year. Beiwang Township in Wuji County helped farmers calculate three accounts: first, how much benefit they had obtained from planting cotton in response to the government's call in the past; second, what are the benefits to farmers of planting cotton to support national industry and industrial development; and third, whether planting cotton is disadvantageous in terms of the grain-cotton price ratio. After such calculations, farmers' concerns were quickly dispelled, and the cotton planting plan was revised. The whole township will plant 1,808 mu, exceeding the original target. When revising the cotton planting plan within the cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives also absorbed farmers outside the cooperatives to participate in the discussion, leading the masses to revise their cotton planting plans one after another. In Ganglou Village, Anguo County, the agricultural production cooperative and mutual aid teams first reported on the plan to expand cotton planting at the villagers' meeting. After the meeting, Party members and cadres went deep into households to specifically help the masses revise their plans. As a result, the entire village expanded cotton fields by 360 mu. Farmers in Zhugezhuang, Hejian County, initially had concerns and were unwilling to plant more cotton. Cadres publicized the cotton-grain price ratio policy to farmers, explaining that planting cotton can support national industrial construction and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, which improved the farmers' awareness. The farmers in the entire village increased the area they intended to plant from 78 mu to 106 mu.

Now, various localities are continuing to mobilize the masses, helping them revise their cotton planting plans, and at the same time leading farmers to harrow the land to conserve moisture, and exchange seeds, striving for timely sowing.

    河北产棉区农业合作社带动农民扩大棉田
    【本报讯】河北省产棉区的农业生产合作社，正在带动广大农民修订种棉计划，根据国家需要扩大棉花的种植面积。
    河北省今年在不影响粮食增产的前提下，计划播种棉花一千六百万亩，平均每亩产皮棉四十斤。总产量要达到六亿四千万斤，比去年提高百分之三十九点一。各地在贯彻种棉计划中，一般是结合宣传总路线，具体讲解国家实行粮食计划收购、计划供应和棉粮比价政策，向农民细算收益账等，提高农民的认识，解除顾虑。县区干部首先帮助农业生产合作社、互助组和党员、团员修订种棉计划，然后通过他们带动一般农民扩大棉田。据深泽、新乐、定县等五县六十一个农业生产合作社的统计，原来打算种三千四百五十五亩，修订计划后，增到四千三百二十八亩。安国县的二百八十八个农业生产合作社。计划增产籽棉八十二万斤，平均每亩棉田比去年增产籽棉六十斤。无极县北汪乡帮助农民算了三笔账，一算以前响应政府号召，种棉得了多少利益；二算种棉支持国家工业，工业发展对农民有什么好处；三算粮棉比价，种棉花是否吃亏？经过这样算账，很快解除了农民的顾虑，修订了种棉计划，全乡要种一千八百零八亩，超过了原定指标。农业生产合作社，在修订社内种棉计划时，还吸收社外农民参加讨论，带动群众纷纷修订种棉计划。安国县岗楼村先由农业生产合作社和互助组在村民大会上报告扩大植棉计划，会后党员、干部深入到户，具体帮助群众修订计划，结果全村扩大棉田三百六十亩。河间县朱各庄的农民开始也有顾虑，不愿多种棉花，干部向农民宣传了棉粮比价政策，说明了种棉能支持国家工业建设和加强工农联盟，提高了农民的觉悟，全村庄农民由原来打算种七十八亩增到一百零六亩。
    现在，各地正继续发动群众，帮助群众修订种棉计划，同时领导农民耙地保墒，调换种籽，争取适时播种。
