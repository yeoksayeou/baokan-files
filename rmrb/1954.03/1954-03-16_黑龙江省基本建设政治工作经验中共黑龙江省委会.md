Black Dragonjiang Province's Basic Construction Political Work Experience
The Chinese Communist Party Heilongjiang Provincial Committee

Last year, the task of basic construction projects in Heilongjiang Province was relatively heavy. To smoothly complete this task, the Provincial Party Committee paid attention to strengthening political work in basic construction and expanding the strength of basic construction. This resolved the contradiction between heavy tasks and limited forces, ensuring the overfulfillment of the 1953 basic construction project tasks. The main experiences in strengthening basic construction political work over the past year are summarized below.

I. Establish Organizations, Allocate Cadres, and
    Strengthen Political Work

Based on the situation of large engineering tasks and limited forces, the Provincial Party Committee implemented the policy of prioritizing basic construction in the entire Party and among all cadres. It mobilized all sectors to vigorously support basic construction, clarifying the importance of supporting key construction projects. This guaranteed the human and material resources needed for basic construction. On the other hand, it focused on strengthening the leadership of basic construction units politically and organizationally. To this end, two political departments were established in the Benxi Engineering Company and the Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau before the start of construction. Sixteen political offices were established in various construction teams, and eighty Party grassroots organizations were established. Nine hundred and sixty-nine cadres were transferred to work in basic construction departments. These transferred cadres underwent short-term training to gain a preliminary understanding of the Party's role in guaranteeing and supervising enterprises. After construction began, all cadres in basic construction departments were organized to study the resolutions of the City Work Conference and the experience of Political Work in the 53rd Factory. Therefore, in the past year, the ideology and steps of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League have been basically unified in basic construction. The idea of focusing on production has been clarified, the advanced working methods of the 53rd Factory have been promoted, and political education has been strengthened for employees. At the same time, organizations such as the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions have been expanded. For example, 292 Party members, 6,000 Communist Youth League members, and 16,363 trade union members have been developed. Communist Youth League members account for 41.1% of the total number of young workers, and trade union members account for 93% of all employees.

II. Deploy Political Work According to
     the Characteristics of Basic Construction

Political work on construction sites first unfolds with production as the center. Its central content includes doing a good job in construction preparation, striving for early commencement, implementing planned management, responsibility systems, quality inspections, and production increase and economy campaigns. This integrates political work closely with production work. For example, the General Branch of the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Construction Team not only educated on the importance of strengthening planned management when preparing construction operation plans, but also, when it was discovered that excavation of the ground trenches generally did not meet quotas, it organized Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to go deep into the groups to study and change the labor organization and construction methods, thereby ensuring the completion of the operation plan. To ensure project quality, the General Branch also compiled operating procedures and quality standards into rhymes to make them easy for workers to understand and remember. For example, the following was suggested to workers mixing mortar: "The mixing ratio is one, two, five (that is, the ratio of cement, lime, and sand), do not be careless when mixing sand, check frequently for proper dryness and wetness, and do not add more than five dan of water." Whether the construction operation plan is completed becomes a sign of the success or failure of political work. Therefore, carrying out political work with the completion of the construction operation plan as the center is a concrete manifestation of the combination of political work and economic work.

Secondly, political work on construction sites is deployed according to the characteristics of basic construction. The first characteristic of basic construction is: the relationships are relatively complex, including the relationship between Party A and Party B and between several contracting units, and the relationship between work sections and work sections, and between types of work. To ensure the normal development of these relationships, the most important thing is to strengthen the education of overall thinking among all employees and overcome the selfish departmentalism of each going its own way and benefiting oneself at the expense of others. For example, when the Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Construction Team contracted the military region's project, it carried out overall ideological education among the employees, focusing on supporting the army and loving the country, and focusing on the military region's project. This made the project ahead of schedule by 25 days, saving more than 700 million yuan (accounting for 34% of the total contracted value), and the quality was even better than the self-operated project. Party A also took great care of the food and accommodation of Party B's workers, and educated its own on-site representatives to actively assist Party B in ensuring project quality, and not to treat the workers with a supervisor's attitude. In this way, the relationship between Party A and Party B was as close as family. The workers said: "We have to find such a Party A next year." Conversely, some construction sites lack overall thinking between Party A and Party B, blaming each other, causing delays and wasting a lot of money on projects due to poor quality. For example, some construction teams knew that the materials were rotten, but as long as Party A did not discover it, they still used it. Some Party A only cared about saving money for their own unit when allocating funds and collecting fees, and did not take care of the state regulations and Party B's difficulties. When some contracting units transferred the contracted project and the prepared sand and other materials to another contracting unit according to the decision of the superior, the sand would cost 29,200 yuan more per cubic meter than the original price. Some work sections would rather sit idle than transfer surplus workers to work sections in need. The essence of these departmentalism is the manifestation of bourgeois ideology. If this ideology is not overcome, the policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe" cannot be implemented.

In addition to conducting overall ideological education, it is also necessary to closely link mutual relations organizationally and institutionally. Between Party A and Party B, we adhered to the establishment of a temporary Party Work Committee composed of responsible cadres from both parties to be responsible for solving major problems existing between the two parties, and combined with education to oppose departmentalism. Some construction sites have implemented joint offices for relevant personnel between Party A and Party B or several contracting units, which has a certain effect on ensuring project construction and strengthening overall thinking and overcoming departmentalism. But in general, most of these systems are not implemented enough, and overall ideological education is not systematic and profound enough.

The second characteristic of basic construction is: construction is seasonal and staged. In general terms, there are two stages: construction preparation and construction. In the construction preparation stage, special attention should be paid to strengthening political work in surveying, design, and various material and labor preparation work, and overcoming the waiting and dependence on thinking in construction preparation. Last year, due to strengthening the ideological leadership of construction preparation work, the start of construction was about one month earlier than the previous year. In construction, we should pay attention to the different characteristics of the initial, middle, and final stages of construction. In the initial stage of construction, due to insufficient preparation, workers are not familiar with the tasks when they first enter the site, and the work is not smooth, and labor efficiency is generally low. Therefore, special attention should be paid to checking construction preparations, mobilizing workers to discuss construction operation plans, organizing workers to promote advanced experience, and breaking through labor quotas and other aspects of political work. By the middle of the construction, the labor efficiency of workers has gradually improved, the work has gradually become tense, and the coordination of work processes has increased. At this time, attention should be paid to preventing and eliminating the phenomenon of rushing progress, neglecting quality, and the lack of cooperation between work processes. In the final stage of construction, on the one hand, we should pay attention to overcoming the complacent and relaxed thinking that "the big part is over;" on the other hand, we should pay attention to the thinking of working overtime due to the eagerness to complete the task. At the same time, in the final stage of construction, we should pay attention to political work such as project acceptance, material and tool recovery, mechanical repair and maintenance, and project settlement.

The third characteristic of basic construction is: there are many handicraftsmen and farmers among the workers, and there are more temporary workers than fixed workers. Therefore, special attention should be paid to strengthening education on labor discipline. In particular, the vast majority of temporary workers are farmers, handicraftsmen, and urban small vendors, etc. They originally lacked the habit of collective labor. In addition, our management system is not perfect. If we do not strengthen the education of labor discipline, it will not only seriously affect the improvement of labor efficiency, but also affect the quality of the project. At the same time, due to the unsound piece-rate wage system in basic construction (there are quantity regulations, but no quality differences), the tendency for workers to rush progress and neglect quality is prone to occur. Therefore, strengthening labor discipline should focus on improving attendance and complying with operating procedures.

The fourth characteristic of basic construction is: the production site has great mobility, and there are many open-air and high-altitude operations. Therefore, the living and working conditions are worse than those in factories and mines. For example, housing is mostly temporary buildings, and residence is not easy to fix, and it often moves once a year. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to the welfare and safety of employees, we must also strengthen communist education for employees, and strengthen education on the glory of working in basic construction positions and carrying forward the spirit of hard work.

III. Organizing the Masses to Carry Out Labor Emulation
     is a Regular Task of Political Work

Last year, various basic construction units universally carried out labor emulation during construction, and about 80% of the employees participated in the emulation, which achieved great results. The characteristics and experiences of labor emulation last year are: First, labor emulation is centered on ensuring the implementation of construction operation plans, which makes the goals of the emulation clear and the content specific. At the same time, labor emulation is an effective method to stimulate and organize the vast number of employees to complete the national construction plan, so the emulation must be centered on completing the national plan. If there is no specific operation plan, the emulation will appear weak and powerless. As some workers said, "With an operation plan, I know what to do, and I have a goal, and I feel happy to work!" Some groups did not have operation plans, and the workers reflected, "I don't know what to do every day, so what is there to emulate?" "How can we see if we have completed and exceeded the plan without an operation plan?" Second, mobilizing the masses to implement Soviet expert suggestions and promote advanced experience is an important guarantee for the victory of labor emulation. The Third Engineering Team of the Thermal Power Plant implemented the Soviet experts' suggestions in the emulation, thereby ensuring the quality of the project and successfully carrying out winter construction. The province promoted 18 advanced experiences and 313 advanced tools in the emulation, and organized various large and small-scale visits and performances, thereby continuously enriching and improving the content of the emulation. Third, while mobilizing the workers, we must pay attention to mobilizing the participation of office staff in the emulation. For example, the Materials Section of the First Division of the Benxi Engineering Company gave full play to the enthusiasm of all section personnel in the emulation, clarified various responsibility systems, not only ensured the material needs of the project, but also saved more than 1.3 billion yuan. Fourth, strengthening labor discipline as one of the important contents of the emulation. In this way, wherever labor emulation is carried out well, labor discipline will be significantly improved. For example, after the comprehensive launch of the emulation in the Architectural Engineering Bureau of the Province in August, the attendance rate increased from 80% to 95%, and the number of quality accidents decreased from 186 in July to 46. This proves that labor emulation is an important method to strengthen labor discipline. Fifth, adhere to the appraisal and reward system to gradually deepen the emulation. Any emulation that insists on appraisal and rewards by section can gradually deepen, and the enthusiasm of the masses will continue to increase; otherwise, if the appraisal is not regular, the emulation will naturally form a tight front and a loose back, and cannot be adhered to and deepened. At the same time, in the appraisal, it naturally forms the self-examination of employees, and the self-criticism and mutual supervision of employees, and the criticism from the bottom up will also develop at the same time.

IV. Uniting and Improving Technical Personnel is
     an Important Part of Political Work

Uniting and improving technical personnel is not only necessary for completing the current production tasks, but also creates favorable conditions for training skilled workers and growing technical strength. Last year, in implementing planned management, carrying out the responsibility system movement, and increasing production and saving campaigns, most units paid attention to mobilizing technical personnel and strengthening the political education of technical personnel. This not only improved the awareness and enthusiasm of technical personnel, but also enabled political work cadres to begin to understand the ideological situation of technical personnel, and initially changed the general view that technical personnel are "highly educated," "complicated," and "backward," and enhanced the confidence in uniting and educating technical personnel. Due to the care of the Party, technical personnel also began to move closer to the Party.

According to the experience of the Third Engineering Team of the Thermal Power Plant, which has done a good job in uniting and educating technical personnel, in addition to holding regular symposiums for technical personnel, uniting and educating technical personnel can mainly be carried out from the following aspects: First, members of the Party Committee personally take charge of dividing up the work of uniting and educating technical personnel. The Party Committee absorbs relevant technical personnel to participate in the discussion of production technology issues, and the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee is responsible for leading the political study of technical personnel. Second, give play to the organizational role of trade unions and Communist Youth Leagues to carry out the work of uniting technical personnel. Some production and technical issues should be resolved by the trade union, which convenes symposiums for technical personnel. Because there are many Communist Youth League members and few Party members among the technical personnel, special attention is also paid to the work of uniting and educating technical personnel by the Communist Youth League organization. Third, educate cadres to implement the policy of uniting technical personnel, overcome the contradictory emotions of grassroots cadres who believe that technical personnel are "highly educated and have a high profile" and therefore "you don't approach me, and I don't approach you," and actively and proactively study work with technical personnel. Fourth, educate workers to respect the technical guidance of technical personnel, and change the emotions of workers who think that technical personnel are "talkers" who do not solve practical problems and do not respect the guidance of technical personnel. Therefore, technical personnel reflect: "Now I am happy to go to the site to work, and the workers are also easy to lead." Due to the above series of work, the awareness and enthusiasm of technical personnel have been improved, and the Party's call can also be warmly responded to by technical personnel. For example, during the increase production and saving campaign, all technical personnel signed a letter to the Party Committee to express their practical actions to welcome the campaign. The technical staff in charge of the construction site took the initiative to send work plans to the branch to solicit the opinions of the branch, and some took the initiative to report their ideological situation to the Party. Participating in the Party's meetings to discuss relevant production and technical issues has become their greatest honor.

Although political work has achieved certain results in the past year, there are still many shortcomings. In implementing the policy of placing basic construction in the primary position, the criticism of the greedy and rash advance thinking of basic construction units is not enough; in cultivating models and giving play to the organizational role, the experience of the better Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant Construction Team was not systematically summarized and improved in a timely manner. There is no mature and typical experience in promoting the experience of the 53rd Factory; the organizational role of Party branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth Leagues in a considerable number of units is not fully exerted, and the work order has not been fully established. The phenomenon of ups and downs in the work is still quite common; in construction, attention is paid to the development of the Party and the cultivation of technical strength is still far from enough. These are all problems that deserve attention and overcoming in future work.

    黑龙江省基本建设政治工作经验
    中共黑龙江省委会
    去年黑龙江省的基本建设工程任务是比较繁重的，为了顺利完成这一任务，省委注意了加强基本建设政治工作与壮大基本建设力量，从而解决了任务重，力量小的矛盾，保证了一九五三年基本建设工程任务的超额完成。兹将一年来加强基本建设政治工作的主要体验总结如下。
    一、建立组织，配备干部，
        加强政治工作
    省委根据工程任务大、力量小的情况，在全党与全体干部中贯彻将基本建设放在首要地位的方针，动员各方面大力支援基本建设，明确支援重点建设的重要性，从而保证了基本建设人力物力的需要；另一方面着重从政治上组织上加强了对基本建设单位的领导。为此，在开工前于本溪工程公司、省建设工程局建立了两个政治部，在各工程队建立十六个政治处，建立八十个党的基层组织，抽调了九百六十九名干部到基本建设部门工作。并对这些转业干部进行了短期训练，使之初步懂得了党在企业中的保证监督作用。施工开始，又组织了所有基本建设部门的干部学习了城工会议决议和五三工厂政治工作的经验。因而一年来在基本建设中基本上贯彻了统一党、行政、工会、青年团的思想和步调，明确认识以生产为中心的思想，推广了五三工厂的先进工作方法，对职工加强了政治教育；同时，又扩大了党、团及工会等组织，如发展了二百九十二名党员，六千名青年团员、一万六千三百六十三名工会会员；青年团员已占青年工人总数的百分之四十一点一，工会会员占全体职工的百分之九十三。
  二、根据基本建设的特点展开
        政治工作
    工地的政治工作，首先是以生产为中心展开的，以做好施工准备工作、争取早开工，贯彻计划管理、责任制、质量检查与增产节约竞赛等为政治工作的中心内容，这样就使政治工作紧密地结合了生产工作。如齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂工程队总支，不仅在编制施工作业计划中，进行了加强计划管理重要意义的教育，而且在开始执行作业计划中，当发现挖地槽普遍达不到定额时，即组织党、行政、工会、青年团干部深入小组，研究改变了劳动组织和施工方法，从而保证了作业计划的完成。总支为了保证工程质量，还将操作规程与质量标准编成顺口溜，使工人易懂易记。如给配灰浆的工人提出：“合灰量为一、二、五（即水泥、白灰与砂子的配合比例），掺砂搅拌不马虎，干湿适度勤检验，加水不得过五担。”施工作业计划完成与否就成为政治工作成败的标志。所以以完成施工作业计划为中心开展政治工作，即是政治工作与经济工作相结合的具体表现。
    其次，工地的政治工作是根据基本建设的特点展开的。基本建设的第一个特点是：关系比较复杂，有甲乙双方与几个承包单位之间的关系，有工段与工段、工种与工种之间的关系。要保证这些关系的正常发展，最重要的是在全体职工中加强整体思想的教育，克服各自为政与损人利己的本位主义思想。如齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂工程队在承包军区工程时，在职工中进行了拥军爱国，以军区工程为重点的整体思想教育，使该工程提前工期二十五天，节省七亿多元（占承包总值百分之三十四），质量比自营工程还好。甲方亦对乙方工人食宿照顾备至，并教育自己施工现场代表要积极协助乙方搞好工程保证质量，不要以监工的态度对待工人，这样甲乙双方关系亲如一家人。工人说：“明年还得找这样的甲方。”相反的有些工地甲乙双方之间缺乏整体思想，互相埋怨，互相扯皮，在工程上造成质量低劣，拖延工期，浪费很大的现象。如有的工程队明知是朽材，但只要甲方没有发现，仍旧用上。也有的甲方在调拨资金与取费上只顾本单位节约，不照顾国家规定与乙方的困难。有的承包单位奉上级决定将自己承包工程及所备的砂子等材料转给另一承包单位时，砂子就要比原价每立方公尺多取两万九千二百多元。有的工段宁愿窝着工，不将多余工人调给需要的工段。这些本位主义的实质就是资产阶级思想的表现。这种思想如不克服，“好、快、省、安全”的方针是无法贯彻的。
    除了进行整体思想教育外，还必须从组织上制度上密切相互关系。在甲乙双方之间，我们坚持了以甲乙双方负责干部组成临时的党的工作委员会，负责解决甲乙双方存在的重大问题，并结合进行反对本位主义思想的教育。有的工地实行了甲乙双方或几个承包单位之间的有关人员联合办公室等，这对保证工程建设与加强整体思想、克服本位主义思想有一定的作用。但总的说来，这些制度多数贯彻的不够，整体思想教育还不够系统和深刻。
    基本建设的第二个特点是：施工有季节性与阶段性。从总的方面来说，有施工准备与施工两个阶段。在施工准备阶段要特别注意加强勘测、设计与各项物资、劳动力准备工作的政治工作，克服施工准备中的等待依赖思想。去年由于加强了施工准备工作的思想领导，就使去年开工比前年提前一个月左右。在施工中要注意施工初期、中期、末期不同的特点。在施工初期因各项准备工作不足，工人初进入现场对任务不熟悉，干活不顺手，劳动效率一般较低，故应特别注意检查施工准备，发动工人讨论施工作业计划，组织工人推广先进经验，突破劳动定额等方面的政治工作。至施工中期，工人劳动效率已逐步提高，工作逐渐紧张，工序配合增多，这时要注意防止和消灭赶进度忽视质量和工序之间的互不配合的现象。在结尾工程时期，一方面要注意克服认为“大头过去了”的自满松劲思想；另一方面要注意急于完成任务而产生的加班加点思想，同时在结尾工程时期要注意工程验收、材料工具回收、机械检修维护、工程决算等项工作的政治工作。
    基本建设的第三个特点是：工人中手工业者与农民成份多，临时工人比固定工人多，所以要特别注意加强劳动纪律教育。特别是临时工人中农民、手工业者、城市小商贩等占绝大多数，他们原来即缺乏集体劳动习惯，加上我们管理制度不完善，如不加强劳动纪律的教育，不仅严重地影响劳动效率的提高，而且影响工程的质量。同时由于基本建设计件工资制不健全（有数量规定、无质量差别），工人赶进度忽视质量的倾向易于产生。所以加强劳动纪律应以提高出勤率与遵守操作规程为中心内容。
    基本建设的第四个特点是：生产场所流动性大，露天作业高空作业多，所以生活条件与工作条件均比厂矿差。如住房多为临时建筑，且居住不易固定，常一年一移动。因此除了注意职工的福利与安全外，还必须对职工加强共产主义教育，加强关于在基本建设工作岗位的光荣与发扬艰苦奋斗作风的教育。
  三、组织群众开展劳动竞赛，
      是政治工作的经常任务
    去年各基本建设单位在施工中普遍开展了劳动竞赛，参加竞赛的职工约占百分之八十，收到了很大成绩。去年劳动竞赛的特点与经验是：第一，劳动竞赛是以保证贯彻施工作业计划为中心，这就使竞赛的目标明确、内容具体。同时劳动竞赛是激发和组织广大职工完成国家建设计划的有效方法，所以竞赛必须以完成国家计划为中心。假如没有具体的作业计划，竞赛就要显得软弱无力。如有的工人说：“有了作业计划心里明白，有个奔头，干活也痛快！”有些小组没有作业计划，工人就反映说：“每天都不知干啥，还竞赛什么？”“没有作业计划怎样能看出我们完成和超过计划呢？”第二，发动群众贯彻苏联专家建议与推广先进经验，是使劳动竞赛胜利前进的重要保证。火力发电厂第三工程队在竞赛中贯彻了苏联专家的各项建议，从而保证了工程质量，胜利地进行了冬季施工。全省在竞赛中推广了十八种先进经验，三百一十三种先进工具，组织了各种大小型参观表演，从而使竞赛内容不断丰富提高。第三，在发动工人的同时必须注意发动科室人员参加竞赛。如本溪工程公司第一处材料科，在竞赛中发挥了全科人员的积极性，明确了各项责任制度，不仅保证了工程上的材料需要，而且节省了十三亿多元。第四，将加强劳动纪律作为竞赛重要内容之一。这样凡是劳动竞赛开展较好的单位，劳动纪律也就有显著提高。如省建筑工程局八月份竞赛全面开展后，出勤率由百分之八十提高到九十五，质量事故由七月的一百八十六次减少到四十六次，这证明劳动竞赛是加强劳动纪律的重要方法。第五，坚持评比奖励制度，使竞赛逐步深入。凡是坚持按段评比奖励的竞赛，即能逐步深入，群众热情亦随之不断提高；反之评比不经常，竞赛自然形成前紧后松，不能坚持深入。同时在评比中，很自然的形成职工自我检查，与职工互相之间的自我批评和互相的监督作用，自下而上的批评亦会同时发展起来。
  四、团结与提高技术人员是
        政治工作的一个重要部分
    团结与提高技术人员，不仅为完成当前生产任务所必需，而且为培养技术工人、生长技术力量创造有利条件。去年在贯彻计划管理、开展责任制运动与增产节约竞赛中，多数单位均注意了发动技术人员，加强对技术人员的政治教育。这不仅使技术人员的觉悟与积极性提高，而且使政治工作干部开始摸到了技术人员的思想情况，初步转变了笼统地认为技术人员“文化高”“复杂”“落后”等看法，增强了团结教育技术人员的信心。技术人员亦由于党的关怀，开始向党靠拢。
    根据团结教育技术人员较好的火力发电厂第三工程队经验，团结教育技术人员除了定期召开技术人员座谈会外，主要可从以下几方面进行：第一，党委委员亲自负责分工进行团结教育技术人员的工作。党委讨论生产技术问题时吸收有关技术人员参加，党委宣传部门负责领导技术人员的政治学习。第二，发挥工会和青年团的组织作用进行团结技术人员的工作。有些生产技术上的问题，应由工会负责，召集技术人员座谈会研究解决。由于技术人员中团员多党员少，还特别注意了由团的组织进行团结教育技术人员的工作。第三，教育干部贯彻团结技术人员的政策，克服了基层干部认为技术人员“文化高、架子大”因而存在“你不接近我，我也不接近你”的对立情绪，积极主动与技术人员研究工作。第四，教育工人尊重技术人员的技术指导，转变了工人认为技术人员是“说客”不解决实际问题，不尊重技术人员指导的情绪。所以技术人员反映：
  “现在到现场工作也高兴，工人也好领导。”由于进行了以上一系列的工作，技术人员的觉悟和积极性提高了，党的号召也能得到技术人员的热烈响应。如在增产节约竞赛时，全体技术人员签名写信向党委表示了以实际行动迎接竞赛，工地专责技术员主动向支部送工作计划，征求支部意见，有的主动向党汇报自己的思想情况。参加党的会议讨论有关生产技术问题，成为他们最大的荣誉。
    一年来政治工作虽然取得一定成绩，但缺点仍是很多的，在贯彻将基本建设放在首要地位的方针中，对基本建设单位的贪多冒进思想批判不够；在培养典型与发挥组织作用方面，对较好的齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂工程队的经验，未及时系统总结提高，推广五三厂经验未取得成熟的典型经验；相当大的一部分单位的党支部与工会、青年团的组织作用发挥不够，工作秩序尚未完全建立起来，工作忽高忽低的现象还相当普遍；在施工中注意发展党与培养生长技术力量做的还很不够。这些都是今后工作中值得注意克服的问题。
