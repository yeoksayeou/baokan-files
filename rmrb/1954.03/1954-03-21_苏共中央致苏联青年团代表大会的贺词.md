The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union warmly congratulates the 12th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) of the Soviet Union and, through it, all young men and women Komsomol members, congratulating the glorious youth of our multinational Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Leninist Young Communist League has cultivated and educated millions of active builders of communist society. The Komsomol has earned the universal love and respect of the Soviet people for its heroic struggle and brilliant labor for the happiness of the motherland. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is confident that our young men and women Komsomol members will continue to expand the glorious cause of the Leninist Young Communist League in the future and dedicate all their energy and youthful strength to the great cause of communist construction.

At present, during this period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, the role of the Komsomol in providing communist education to young people, mastering the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, and consciously embodying the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is constantly increasing. The Komsomol should tirelessly educate Soviet youth to have the spirit of selfless service to the motherland and loyalty to the Communist Party, the spirit of the inseparable friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and cultivate in youth the excellent qualities of Soviet people: love of labor, high spirits, courage, confidence in the victory of our cause, and determination to overcome all difficulties and obstacles. It is the responsibility of the Komsomol to use all means to enable young people to continuously improve their production skills, tirelessly master knowledge and the achievements of advanced science and technology, and be good at applying these achievements in various sectors of the national economy and culture. The Komsomol should tirelessly concern itself with the physical training of young people, and with training young people to prepare for labor and defending the motherland.

One of the most important tasks of the Komsomol is to ensure that Komsomol members and all Soviet youth participate more actively in political, economic, and cultural construction, and participate in the entire socio-political life of the country. Young people should pay particular attention to further developing socialist industry, to realizing the plans formulated by the Party and the government to vigorously improve all sectors of agriculture and the production of consumer goods, and to solving the great national task of fully satisfying the growing needs of our residents for consumer goods in the next two to three years. The Komsomol should more widely launch socialist competitions, demonstrate more initiative and enthusiasm, and mobilize the strength of Soviet youth to greatly improve labor productivity in all sectors of the national economy.

In order to successfully take on the role of the Communist Party's assistant and reserve, the Komsomol must constantly improve its work. The Komsomol organs, which play a major role in carrying out the current tasks of Soviet youth, should resolutely rectify their work, eliminate high-handed bureaucratic methods in leading the work of the Komsomol organization, and do more concrete organizational and educational work among young people.

The focus of attention of the Komsomol organization should be living people—Komsomol members and Soviet youth—constantly caring about their work, life, education, upbringing, and meeting the growing needs and interests of young people. To this end, it is necessary to continuously expand and strengthen flexible ties with the broad masses of young people.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is confident that the Leninist Young Communist League and all Soviet youth, educated in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, will always be the vanguard of democratic youth and will always wage a noble struggle for world peace. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is confident that the Komsomol, which unites more than eighteen million young builders of communist society, will continue to be a reliable assistant to the Party in the struggle for the victory of communism, and will gloriously fulfill the sacred obligations entrusted to it by the Soviet people and the socialist motherland.

Long live the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union!
Long live the glorious Soviet youth!
Long live our great socialist motherland! The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

    苏共中央致苏联青年团代表大会的贺词
    苏联共产党中央委员会热烈祝贺苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会并通过它祝贺全体男女青年团员，祝贺我们多民族的苏联的光荣的青年们。列宁共产主义青年团在共产党的领导下，培养和教育了千百万共产主义社会的积极建设者。青年团由于为祖国的幸福而进行英勇的斗争和光辉的劳动，获得了苏联人民普遍的敬爱。苏联共产党中央委员会深信：我们男女青年团员们今后还将扩大列宁共产主义青年团的光荣事业，把自己的全部精力和青春力量献给伟大的共产主义建设事业。
    目前，正是由社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的时期，青年团在对青年实行共产主义教育，掌握马克思列宁主义基础，自觉地体现战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说方面的作用在不断地提高。青年团应该不倦地教育苏联青年具有忘我地为祖国服务和忠诚于共产党的精神，具有苏联各族人民不可分离的友好精神，培养青年具有苏联人的优秀品质：爱劳动、精神焕发、勇敢、对我们事业必胜的信心、克服一切困难和障碍的决心。用一切办法使青年们不断提高自己的生产技能，孜孜不倦地掌握知识和先进的科学和技术的成就，并善于在国民经济和文化的各部门中运用这些成就，这就是青年团的责任。青年团应不倦地关心青年的体格锻炼，关心训练青年准备劳动与保卫祖国。
    青年团最重要的一项任务是：保证青年团员和全体苏联青年更积极地参加政治、经济和文化建设，参加国家的整个社会政治生活。青年们应该特别集中注意力来进一步发展社会主义工业，来实现党和政府所制订的大力提高农业各部门和消费品生产的计划，来解决伟大的全民的任务——在最近两三年内充分满足我国居民对消费品的日益增长的需要。青年团应该更广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，更多地表现积极性和主动性，发动苏联青年的力量来大力提高国民经济各部门的劳动生产率。
    为了成功地担当起共产党的助手和后备军的作用，青年团必须不断地改进自己的工作。在执行苏联青年的当前任务中起重大作用的青年团机关，应该坚决地整顿自己的工作，在领导青年团组织的工作中铲除高高在上的官僚主义的方法，在青年中做更多的具体的组织工作和教育工作。
    青年团组织的注意中心应该是活的人——青年团员和苏联青年，经常关心他们的工作、生活、教育、教养以及满足青年们日益增长的需要和兴趣。为此，就必须不断地扩大和加强与广大青年群众的灵活的联系。
    苏联共产党中央委员会深信：受到无产阶级国际主义精神教育的列宁共产主义青年团和全体苏联青年始终是民主青年的先锋队，始终为争取世界和平而进行崇高的斗争。苏联共产党中央委员会深信：团结了一千八百余万年青的共产主义社会建设者的青年团，今后仍将是党在争取共产主义胜利的斗争中的可靠的助手，定能光荣地完成苏联人民和社会主义祖国所交给的神圣义务。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团万岁！
    光荣的苏联青年万岁！
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！苏联共产党中央委员会
