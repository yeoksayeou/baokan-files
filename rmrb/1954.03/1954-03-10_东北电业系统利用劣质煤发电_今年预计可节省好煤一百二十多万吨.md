The Northeast China power system made significant achievements in substituting low-quality coal for high-quality coal in power generation in 1953. This year, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee has thoroughly analyzed the sources and production of low-quality coal throughout the region and has established fixed supply relationships between coal mines and power plants, requiring both parties to incorporate the utilization and supply of low-quality coal into their production plans. According to the plans of various units, the average proportion of low-quality coal used in the total coal consumption of power plants throughout the region will increase to 76% this year, with a total of 1.6 million tons of low-quality coal used, saving over 1.2 million tons of good coal.

Inspired by advanced Soviet experience, thermal power plants in Northeast China began using low-quality coal to replace some high-quality coal for power generation in 1951. Over the past few years, the use of low-quality coal has yielded good results. Last year, the proportion of low-quality coal mixed into the total coal consumption of power plants throughout the region increased from 40% in 1952 to 65%, and the types of low-quality coal utilized increased by eight. Last year, the region used a total of 1.09 million tons of low-quality coal, saving 830,000 tons of good coal. This saved the state 29 billion yuan for the whole year, and the cost of coal consumption for all power plants decreased by 6.9%.

Before the implementation of low-quality coal for power generation, many low-value low-quality coal types were discarded by coal mines in Northeast China. This is because naturally formed coal seams are mixed with water-bearing gangue (rock of coal quality), semi-anthracite, outcrop coal, and inferior coal (both types of inferior coal are exposed to the earth's surface). During the coal washing process, a sediment of coal dust and mud, called coal slime, is produced. Although the same labor and costs were spent on them during mining, they not only lacked appropriate use in the past but also became troublesome problems in coal mine production. For example, the Benxi Mining Bureau had no place to put water-bearing gangue and had to dump it into the Taizi River. The Fushun Longfeng Mine was unable to process hundreds of thousands of tons of water-bearing gangue and coal slime produced each year and could only let the wind and rain erode them, allowing the water to wash them away. After using low-quality coal to replace good coal for power generation, these problems were not only solved, avoiding the alarming waste in coal mine production, but also saving a large amount of transportation capacity. The Fushun Power Plant and the Benxi Power Plant can save a lot of transportation capacity every year because of using local water-bearing gangue for power generation.

During the trial burning of low-quality coal, many technical equipment difficulties were encountered. For example, water-bearing gangue has a high water content, and it is difficult to load and unload trucks after it freezes in winter. To solve these problems, in 1953, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee, together with the Northeast Electric Power Administration and the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, formed two joint groups to promote the work in southern and northern Manchuria, respectively. They helped solve technical problems such as reducing the moisture content of coal slime and the freezing of water-bearing gangue in winter; helped the Anshan Power Plant successfully try using water-slag coal from the Angang Chemical Department for power generation; and helped the Dalian and Benxi Power Plants try burning coal slime. The promotion team also helped power plants, coal mines, and railways establish close ties, reducing the lack of coordination that existed in the past. The Northeast Financial and Economic Committee also criticized the insufficient attention and localism and the fear of trouble of the various units, which powerfully promoted this movement.

    东北电业系统利用劣质煤发电
    今年预计可节省好煤一百二十多万吨
    东北电业系统推行劣质煤代替好煤发电的工作，在一九五三年取得了重大成绩。今年，东北财政经济委员会详细分析了全区劣质煤的来源及生产情况，并且确定了煤矿与发电厂固定的供应关系，要求双方都把利用、供应劣质煤订入生产计划中去。根据各单位的计划，今年全区各发电厂全部燃煤中利用劣质煤的平均比例将提高到百分之七十六，共可利用一百六十万吨劣质煤，可节省好煤一百二十多万吨。
    在苏联先进经验的启示下，东北各火力发电厂从一九五一年起就开始利用劣质煤来代替部分好煤发电了。几年来，利用劣质煤收到了很好效果。去年全区各发电厂全部燃煤中搀入劣质煤的比例由一九五二年的百分之四十提高到百分之六十五，利用劣质煤的种类增加了八种。去年全区共利用劣质煤一百零九万吨，节省了八十三万吨好煤。全年为国家节约了二百九十亿元，全部发电厂燃煤成本降低了百分之六点九。
    在没有推行利用劣质煤发电前，东北区各煤矿丢掉了好多价值较低的劣质煤。因为天然生成的煤层都混杂着一些经济价值较低的水矸子（属于煤质的岩石）、半无烟煤、露头煤、粗劣煤（这两种都是接触地表的劣煤）。在洗煤过程中又产生了一种煤粉与泥土的沉淀物——煤泥。在开采中虽然对它们也花了同样的劳动力，用了同样的成本，然而过去不但找不到适当用途，而且成了煤矿生产中的麻烦问题。如本溪矿务局因为没有地方放水矸子，不得不把它扔到太子河里去；抚顺龙凤矿对每年出产几十万吨的水矸子和煤泥也无法处理，只得任风吹雨淋，以至让水冲走。利用劣质煤代替好煤发电后，不但解决了这些问题，避免了煤矿生产当中惊人的浪费现象，同时还节省了大量的运输力。抚顺发电厂和本溪发电厂由于利用当地水矸子发电后，每年可节省运输力很多。
    在试烧劣质煤过程中，曾遇到许多技术设备上的困难，如水矸子含水甚多，在冬季冻结后，装卸车很困难。为了解决这些问题，一九五三年，东北财政经济委员会曾与东北电业管理局、东北煤矿管理局组成两个联合小组分别到南满、北满进行了推广工作。帮助解决了减少煤泥湿分、冬季水矸子冻结等技术问题；帮助鞍山发电厂成功地试用了鞍钢化工部的水渣煤发电；帮助大连、本溪发电厂试烧煤泥。推行小组又帮助发电厂、煤矿、铁路之间取得了密切的联系，减少了过去互不衔接的现象。东北财政经济委员会并批判了各单位对此重视不足和本位主义、怕麻烦的思想，有力地推动了这个运动。
