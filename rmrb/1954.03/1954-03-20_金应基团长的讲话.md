    Speech by Head of Delegation Kim Ung-gi
    Respected Premier Comrade! Respected Comrades!
    Our Korean People's Delegation to China expresses our heartfelt gratitude to Premier Comrade for hosting this banquet.
    The time-honored friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged in blood in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, have become even more consolidated and have demonstrated their invincible power.
    During our Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people sent the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean front to fight shoulder to shoulder with our Korean People's Army, defending our country from enemy aggression and winning a great victory.
    In the post-war period, the Chinese people gave us a huge aid of 800 billion yuan for the recovery and construction of our national economy; in particular, the signing of the economic and cultural cooperation agreement between the two governments of China and Korea has further strengthened the unity and friendship between the two peoples.
    Such tremendous assistance from the Chinese people, together with the tremendous assistance from the great Soviet people and the peoples of various people's democratic countries, has become an important guarantee for the Korean people to strive for new achievements and victories in post-war reconstruction.
    We, the Korean people, are deeply aware of how precious is the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean people under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the respected and beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and regard the consolidation and development of this friendship and unity as our sacred task.
    We are confident that with the active help and care of the fraternal Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, our Korean People's Delegation to China will effectively accomplish its task of strengthening the friendship, unity, and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Korean peoples.
    I propose a toast to the longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Korean people.

    金应基团长的讲话
    尊敬的总理同志！尊敬的诸位同志！
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，对总理同志这样设宴款待，表示衷心的感谢。
    具有悠久传统的友谊关系的中朝两国人民，在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，用鲜血凝结成的战斗的友谊团结更加巩固了，并显示了它的不可战胜的威力。
    在我们祖国解放战争时期，中国人民把由自己的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军派到朝鲜前线来，和我们朝鲜人民军并肩作战，从敌人的侵略下保卫我们的祖国，争取了伟大的胜利。
    在战后时期，中国人民为了我国人民经济的恢复和建设，给予我们八万亿元的巨大援助；特别是中朝两国政府签订了经济及文化合作协定，进一步加强了两国人民的团结友谊。
    中国人民的这样巨大的援助，和伟大的苏联人民及各人民民主国家人民的巨大援助一起，成为朝鲜人民在战后恢复工作中争取新的成就和胜利的重要保证。
    我们朝鲜人民都深刻地认识到，在朝鲜劳动党和敬爱的领袖金日成元帅领导下的朝鲜人民和在中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民所结成的牢不可破的友谊团结，是多么高贵的事情，并把巩固和发展这个友谊团结，看成是自己神圣的任务。
    我们深信在兄弟般的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府的积极帮助和照顾下，我们朝鲜人民访华代表团将有效地完成为加强中朝两国人民的友谊团结和文化交流的工作任务。
    我建议为中国人民的伟大领袖、朝鲜人民的亲密的朋友毛泽东主席的万寿无疆干杯。
