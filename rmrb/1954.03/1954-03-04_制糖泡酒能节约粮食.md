    Making Sugar Wine Can Save Grain
    Lan Chongren of the Tax Bureau of the Wuming County People's Government in Guangxi Province writes: Farmers in the sugar-producing area of Wuming County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have traditionally used the foam left over from boiling sugar, plus distiller's yeast (flour), to brew sugar wine. The quality of the wine produced in this way is similar to that of rice wine. However, some farmers, because they find it troublesome or fear they won't be able to sell the wine, often discard these useful byproducts when boiling sugar.

    Recently, the Wuming County Wholesale Department of the China Monopoly Company, in order to save grain and ensure the supply of alcohol to the local ethnic minorities, has not only been experimenting with brewing wine from coarse grains, but also, when the new sugar production began in January this year, mobilized farmers to use by-products to make their own sugar wine, set reasonable prices, and actively purchased it. They, together with the tax authorities, went deep into the sugar-producing areas to publicize the role and significance of saving grain to support national industrialization. In addition, they helped farmers study and solve the difficulties of lacking containers (wine jars, etc.). After many farmers understood the principle of saving grain, they actively brewed sugar wine. Farmers in the Eighth District's sugar-producing area have also made plans or agreements to sell the brewed wine to state-owned companies. In this way, on the one hand, grain is saved, and the state's tax revenue is increased; on the other hand, farmers' income is also increased. At present, many farmers have sold sugar wine. The Monopoly Company purchased more than 300 jin in one day at the Xinlugan market in the Eighth District, and purchased more than 160 jin on the first day of purchasing at the Fucheng market in the Seventh District.

    I suggest that the governments and relevant business departments in other sugar-producing areas should also pay attention to educating farmers to use the by-products of sugar boiling to make wine, in order to save grain for the country.

### 制糖泡酒能节约粮食

    制糖泡酒能节约粮食
    广西省武鸣县人民政府税务局蓝崇仁来信：桂西僮族自治区武鸣县产糖区的农民，向来有利用熬糖剩下的泡沫再加酒饼（面）熬制成糖泡酒的习惯。这样制成的酒，质量与米酒差不多。但是，有一部分农民因嫌麻烦或怕做了酒卖不出，熬糖时往往把这些有用的东西丢弃了。
    最近，中国专卖公司武鸣县批发部为了节约粮食并保证供应当地少数民族人民饮酒的需要，除试用杂粮熬酒外，并在今年一月新糖开始生产时发动农民利用副产物自制糖泡酒，订出合理价格积极收购。他们会同税务机关深入产糖地区向农民宣传了节约粮食对支援国家工业化的作用和意义，此外还帮助农民研究解决缺乏容器（酒缸等）的困难。不少农民懂得了节约粮食的道理后，就积极熬制糖泡酒。第八区产糖区的农民还订出了熬酒后卖给国营公司的计划或公约。这样一方面节约了粮食，使国家增加了税收；另一方面也增加了农民的收入。目前已有很多农民出售糖泡酒，专卖公司在第八区新陆干圩一天就收购了三百多斤，在第七区府城圩开始收购的第一天也收购了一百六十余斤。
    我建议其他产糖地区的政府及有关业务部门也应注意教育农民利用熬糖的副产物制酒，为国家节约粮食。
