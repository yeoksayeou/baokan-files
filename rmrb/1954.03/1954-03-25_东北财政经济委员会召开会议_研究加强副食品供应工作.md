The Northeast Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee convened a non-staple food supply meeting in late February. At the meeting, Gu Zhuoxin, Director of the Financial and Economic Committee, delivered a report and summary on "Strengthening the Supply of Non-Staple Foods to Important Cities, Industrial and Mining Areas, and Forest Areas." Through this meeting, a more comprehensive analysis was made of the production, supply, and consumption of non-staple foods in the entire region, and based on this, future production and supply guidelines and improvement measures were determined.

In order to thoroughly solve the problem of non-staple food supply, the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee organized personnel from the financial and economic committees and trade and cooperative departments of various provinces and cities to study the experiences of areas with better non-staple food production or supply before the meeting. It also investigated the production and supply of non-staple foods in various directly-administered cities and the Fuxin mining area and Yichun forest area, as well as the production and supply of non-staple foods in various provinces and cities. After such a comprehensive and systematic investigation and study, the problems and difficulties existing in the production and supply of non-staple foods in various places were identified. Based on the above situation, in addition to balancing the 1954 production and sales plan for non-staple foods, the meeting clearly proposed that the central link for improving the supply of non-staple foods in the future is: vigorously increasing production, organizing and strengthening procurement work, strengthening the planning of production and supply, overcoming the frequent occurrence of out-of-stock phenomena through active production increase and improved purchase and supply, and ensuring market and price stability. Therefore, the meeting decided to implement the policy of "zonal supply," that is, under a unified plan, with large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas as the center, to plan several nearby counties as an economic zone for production and procurement, to supply the needs of urban and rural people, especially large and medium-sized cities, industrial and mining areas, and forest areas for non-staple foods. In order to expand the production of non-staple foods, the meeting believed that the development of vegetables, meat, aquatic products, etc., should be listed as one of the main contents of the agricultural development plan in the future. According to the needs of all parties, production increase targets for this year were proposed. It is required that the total number of pigs raised in the entire region be increased by 15 to 20 percent compared to 1953, and according to different regions, farmers should be organized to raise one to two fat pigs per year. In key areas, the area of water gardens will be expanded by one to one and a half times this year, and a large number of hotbeds will be added, and the area of vegetable planting will be appropriately expanded. For example, in the Yichun forest area, where transportation is more difficult, all arable land will be planted with vegetables and pasture this year, which can achieve basic self-sufficiency. In terms of aquatic products, this year's plan is to increase production by 35 percent compared to last year. The meeting also solved the specific problems of investment, storage and transportation, and feed needed to increase production, and proposed that in the future, all urban construction should pay attention to planning fixed livestock areas, vegetable gardens, etc.

In order to strengthen the organizational leadership of non-staple food procurement and supply work, in addition to the establishment of special institutions such as non-staple food management committees and food companies in key cities and counties, it is particularly important to strengthen the connection between production, supply, and consumption. Various localities have explored some better experiences, such as the zonal supply of pork, trade and cooperative organizations signing various supply and sales contracts with producers and consumers, etc. The meeting also determined that through improving business management, the price of non-staple foods in the entire region will be stable and reasonable, and the purchase price will be appropriately increased without increasing the burden on consumers, in order to encourage farmers to increase production. In order to stabilize the market and ensure supply, the proportion of supply by state-owned commerce and cooperatives should be gradually increased, and retail organizations should be appropriately increased in newly built worker residential areas, basic construction sites, etc.

    东北财政经济委员会召开会议
    研究加强副食品供应工作
    东北行政委员会财政经济委员会在二月下旬召开了副食品供应会议。会议中由财政经济委员会主任顾卓新作了“关于加强对重要城市、工矿、林区副食品供应工作”的报告和总结。通过这次会议，对全区副食品的生产、供应和消费情况作了较全面的分析，并据以确定了今后的生产、供应方针和改进措施。
    为了较彻底地解决副食品供应问题，东北财经委员会在召开会议前曾组织各省市财政经济委员会及贸易、合作部门的人员到副食品生产或供应较好的地区学习经验；调查了各直属市及阜新矿区、伊春林区的副食品生产供应情况及各省、市的副食品生产、供应概况。经过这样较全面系统的调查研究后，摸清了各地副食品生产和供应工作中存在的问题和困难。根据以上情况，会上除平衡了一九五四年副食品的产销计划之外，并明确提出今后改善副食品供应的中心环节是：大力增加生产，组织和加强采购工作，加强生产和供应的计划性，从积极增产与改进收购供应中，克服经常发生的脱销现象，保证市场和价格的稳定。因此，会上决定贯彻“分区供应”的方针，即在统一的计划之下，以大中城市、工矿、林区为中心，规划出临近若干县份作为一个生产、采购的经济区划，供应城乡人民特别是大中城市、工矿、林区的副食品需要。为了扩大副食品生产，会议认为今后应把发展蔬菜、肉类、水产等的生产列为农业发展计划的主要内容之一。根据各方面的需要提出了今年的增产指标。要求全区养猪总数比一九五三年提高百分之十五至二十，根据不同地区，组织农民全年饲养一头到两头肥猪。在各重点地区今年将扩大水园一倍到一倍半，并大量增加温床，适当扩大蔬菜种植面积。如运输较困难的伊春林区，今年将把全部耕地都种植蔬菜和牧草，可做到基本自给。在水产方面今年计划比去年增产百分之三十五。会上还解决了增加生产所需要的投资、储运、饲料等具体问题，并提出今后各城市建设都应注意规划出固定的饲畜区、菜园区等。
    为了加强副食品采购、供应工作的组织领导，除各重点市、县成立副食品管理委员会及食品公司等专门机构外，特别要加强生产、供应和消费之间的结合，各地已摸索出一些较好的经验，如猪肉的分区供应，贸易、合作组织与生产和消费者订立各种供销合同等。会上还确定从改善经营管理中，使全区副食品的价格稳定而合理，并在不再增加消费者负担的原则下适当提高收购价格，以鼓励农民增产。为了稳定市场，保证供应，逐步增加国营商业和合作社的供应比重，在新建的工人住宅区、基本建设工地等适当增设零售组织。
