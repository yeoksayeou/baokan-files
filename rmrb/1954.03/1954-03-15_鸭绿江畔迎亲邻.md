On the morning of March 13th, the early spring sun shone on the Yalu River, which borders China and North Korea, and on Sinuiju and Andong, which face each other across the river. In Andong, peaceful labor quickly erased the traces of war. The shops on Sanma Road, which were bombed in April 1952, have long been repaired and are now neat and tidy. The railway workers' residential area at the foot of Zhenjiang Mountain, which was bombed last May, has also been rebuilt with red and yellow three-story buildings. Across the river, Sinuiju is also being rebuilt from the ruins. The cheerful whistles of locomotives echo the sounds of labor and construction in Andong across the river. Peaceful smoke rises from both banks, and white gulls circle and fly over the green river. Only the solid air defense positions and the anti-aircraft guns pointing to the sky show that these are two defense cities jointly guarding against the enemy.

Andong and Sinuiju, these two brotherly cities, once spent the most difficult years of the war together. The fire burned across the Yalu River, and millions of Chinese People's Volunteers marched across the Yalu River Bridge. Now, in the days of peaceful labor, the people of Andong are once again welcoming their dear neighbors and brothers – the delegation of the Korean people visiting China – on the banks of the Yalu River.

It was still early, but the station was already crowded with people welcoming the delegation. Aunt Jiao, a soldier's family member, arrived almost two hours early, she was so anxious. While looking towards the Yalu River Bridge, she couldn't help but remember what her little daughter, Jiefang, had asked her in the morning: "Mom, Mom, is that Korean sister who boils water for you every day coming too?" It turned out that Aunt Jiao had participated in a delegation to North Korea last year and had stayed in the home of a 14-year-old Korean orphan girl. Her parents had been killed by American planes. Her older brother, who was one year older than her, worked in the fields. In addition to taking care of all the housework, she also carried a large earthenware pot to wash clothes for the Chinese People's Volunteers. Aunt Jiao stayed in her house for three days, and she boiled water for her every day, calling her "Mom" like her own mother. When Aunt Jiao left, she saw her off with tears in her eyes. After Aunt Jiao returned, she often talked about her, so much so that her little daughter also missed this Korean sister.

"Really, will she come?" Aunt Jiao thought, "And will that 72-year-old Aunt Wu, who got up in the middle of the night to grind tofu for the Chinese People's Volunteers, come?"

On November 8, 1950, American planes dropped tens of thousands of incendiary bombs on Sinuiju. The fire burned in Sinuiju for two days and one night, turning the Yalu River red. Zhang Wenhe, a railway worker from Andong who crossed the river on that day to support the war and did not return until after the armistice, was also waiting, waiting for the brave Korean railway workers who had repaired the bridge with him in the frozen Chongchon River and together pulled out time bombs.

Many more people standing in the station square had not been to North Korea, but they loved this heroic country as much as they loved their own. The residents of this city, which is separated from North Korea by only a river, felt the pulse of this fighting nation particularly strongly. The electricity supply here is transmitted from North Korea via the Yalu River Bridge. In November 1950, when American planes continuously bombed Sinuiju, Andong's water and electricity were cut off for fourteen days. Su Facheng, a model worker in the Andong Electric Power Industry, led workers to the burning Jiangqiao Bridge at that time, climbed onto the high power line racks and repaired the lines together with the Korean electric power workers. At that time, enemy planes were still bombing the homes of these Korean workers. Their houses were destroyed, and their children were killed. But Su Facheng saw that the faces of these Korean workers were like rocks, solemn and silent, without shedding a single tear. They worked continuously for three days and nights, and the lines were finally repaired. When the machines in Andong City started running again, and the whole city was brightly lit at night, and the children were reviewing their lessons under the bright lights, Su Facheng and the people of Andong City deeply felt that what was transmitted through the lines was not only the electric current from North Korea, but also the light and heat emitted by the Korean working class in the war. Now, Su Facheng is waiting for those heroic electric power workers.

Among the crowd was also an old Korean guerrilla fighter, Cui Yeshun. Her two sons and one daughter-in-law all sacrificed heroically in the White Mountains and Black Waters during the Anti-Japanese War. Looking at the national flags of China and North Korea hanging at the station, she said excitedly: "The blood of Korean sons and daughters is on the Chinese flag, and the blood of Chinese sons and daughters is also on the Korean flag!" She naturally longed to see the heroic sons and daughters of her own people.

They finally heard the cheerful whistle of the train. The train carrying the delegation of the Korean people visiting China and the actors of three art troupes finally passed smoothly over the Yalu River Bridge and sped towards the station. The station was filled with cheerful military music. Four hundred and fifty Young Pioneers, like spring swallows, rushed towards the delegates with early spring flowers in their hands. They raised their hands and saluted the Korean uncles and aunts who had protected their flower-like happy youth with the Young Pioneer salute. Kim Ung-gi, head of the delegation, and deputy heads Kim Dal-hyun, Baek Nam-un, Ri Dong-yeong, and Ri Yeong-ho also hugged the children tightly. Look! The heroes of the Republic wearing gold star medals appeared – Park Chan-su, the heroic fighter who defended the "1211" height, squad leader Jang Hyeon-hwa, battalion commander Ryu Man-su, one, two, three... The children's eyes were dazzled. How many heroes are there in Korea! Female tank driver Choi Bun-ok also appeared, smiling and waving to the welcoming crowd. The girls in the square stared at her with admiration. Choi ?, the Korean boy rescued by Luo Shengjiao, whom the Chinese people are familiar with, also came to the motherland of his long-desired brother Luo Shengjiao. Although Aunt Jiao's longed-for Aunt Wu did not come, Gu Fuye, another Korean mother who had also been tested by the war, came. Although Su Facheng did not see the Korean electrical worker, he found Kim Jik-hyeon, a labor hero from the Aoji coal mine. The delegation also included scholars Choi Myeong-hak and Gye Eung-sang, who persisted in scientific research during the war, and Shin Geon-hee, president of Kim Chaek University of Technology. Aren't their gray hairs showing their hard work for their country and for peace? There were also writers Hwang Geon, composer Ri Jeong-eon, and artist Gil Jin-seop from the literary and art front, who had used their pens to encourage and educate the people to strike hard at the enemy. There are also leading cadres from various fronts of industry, agriculture, youth, and women, and heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations. Speaking of the war of more than three years, speaking of the final victory of the war, people cannot help but think of them, and cannot help but be grateful to them. Following closely behind the delegates were more than 300 actors from the People's Army Concert Troupe, the National Classical Art Theater, and the National Art Theater. They also used their artistic weapons to strike at the enemy during the arduous years of more than three years.

Glory! These people from the heroic homeland, these people who exchanged their hardships and sacrifices for human peace and happiness!

    鸭绿江畔迎亲邻
    金凤
    三月十三日的早晨，初春的阳光照耀着中朝接壤的鸭绿江，照耀着隔江互望的新义州和安东。在安东，和平的劳动很快就抹去了战争的痕迹。一九五二年四月被炸的三马路上店铺，早已修复得整整齐齐。去年五月被轰炸的镇江山下铁路职工住宅区，也已经矗立起红色和黄色的三层楼房。而隔岸的新义州也正从废墟中重建起来，汽笛愉快的叫声和安东劳动建设的声音隔江应和着。和平的炊烟从两岸升起，白鸥在绿溶溶的江面上盘旋飞翔。只有那坚固的防空阵地和指向天空的高射炮口，还显示着这是两个在共同地对敌警戒中的国防城市。
    安东和新义州，这两个兄弟城市曾经共同度过战争时最艰难的岁月。大火烧过鸭绿江来，鸭绿江桥上走过千千万万志愿军。如今，在和平劳动的日子里，安东人民又在鸭绿江边来欢迎自己的亲邻居、亲兄弟——朝鲜人民访华代表团了。
    时间还早，车站上已经拥挤着欢迎的人群。性急的军属缴大娘早到了差不多两个钟头。她一边向着鸭绿江上的大铁桥张望，一边又不由得想起早晨自己小女儿解放追着问的话：“妈妈，妈妈，那个天天给你烧开水的朝鲜姐姐也来吗？”原来缴大娘去年参加了赴朝慰问团，曾经住在一家十四岁的朝鲜小孤女家里。她的父母全被美国飞机炸死了，比她大一岁的哥哥下地种田，她除料理一切家务，还顶着大瓦盆给志愿军洗衣服。缴大娘在她家住了三天，她天天给大娘烧开水，跟着大娘叫妈妈。大娘临走时她含着满眼的眼泪送别。缴大娘回来后就时常念叨她，以至于小女儿也想念着这位朝鲜姐姐了。
    “真的，她会不会来呢？”缴大娘想着，“还有那半夜起来磨豆腐给志愿军吃的、七十二岁的吴大娘会不会来呢？”
    一九五○年十一月八日，美国飞机在新义州丢了几万颗燃烧弹，大火在新义州烧了两天一夜，大火烧红了鸭绿江。就在这一天冒火过江支援战争，直到停战后才回来的安东铁路工人张温和也在等待着。等待着和自己一起在冰冻的清川江中抢修大桥，一起拉定时炸弹的勇敢的朝鲜铁路工人。
    在车站广场上站着的更多的人，并没有去过朝鲜，但是他们热爱这个英雄的国度有如热爱自己的国家。和朝鲜只一江之隔的这个城市的居民，特别强烈地感觉到这个战斗的国家跳动的脉搏。这里的电源是通过鸭绿江桥从朝鲜发送过来的。一九五○年十一月美国飞机连续狂炸新义州，当时安东的水电停了十四天。安东电业劳动模范苏发成就是在那时候带着工人跑到燃烧着的江桥上，爬到高高的电线架上和朝鲜电业工人一起抢修线路的。当时敌机还在轰炸着这些朝鲜工人的家，他们的房子炸毁了，他们的孩子炸死了。但苏发成看到这些朝鲜工人的脸像岩石一样，威严而沉默，没有滴一点眼泪。他们连续抢修三昼夜，线路终于修好了。当安东市的机器又重新转动起来，全市入夜又大放光明时，孩子们又在明亮的灯光下温习功课时，苏发成和安东市人民深深感觉到通过线路传来的不仅仅是来自朝鲜的电流，也是朝鲜工人阶级在战争中发射的光和热。现在，苏发成在等待着那些英勇的电业工人。
    人丛中还有着一位朝鲜族的老游击队员崔野顺。她的两个儿子和一个儿媳都是抗日时期在白山黑水间壮烈牺牲的。她看着悬挂在车站上的中朝两国的国旗，激动地说着：“在中国的国旗上有着朝鲜儿女的鲜血，在朝鲜的国旗上也有着中国儿女的鲜血！”她自然渴望看一看她同族的英雄儿女。
    他们终于听到了汽笛愉快的鸣叫，载着朝鲜人民访华代表团代表和三个艺术团体演员的火车，终于平稳地通过鸭绿江大桥，向车站奔驰而来。车站上扬起一片欢乐的军乐声，四百五十个红领巾像春天的燕子一样捧着初春的鲜花扑向代表们，他们举手向保卫了他们鲜花似的幸福青春的朝鲜伯伯、叔叔和姑姑们行着少年先锋队的敬礼。代表团团长金应基和副团长金达铉、白南云、李东英、李永镐也紧紧拥抱着孩子们。看吧！佩着金星勋章的共和国英雄出现了——坚守“一二一一”高地的英雄战士朴赞洙，小队长张贤化，大队长柳万洙，一个、两个、三个……孩子们的眼都看花了，朝鲜有多少英雄啊！女坦克驾驶员崔粉玉也出现了，她微笑着和欢迎的群众招手，广场上的女孩子带着钦慕的眼光注视着她。中国人民熟悉的被罗盛教救起的朝鲜少年崔?也来到他久已想望的罗盛教哥哥的祖国。缴大娘盼望的吴老大娘虽然没有来，但和吴老大娘同样经过战争考验的另外一位朝鲜母亲具富叶却来了。苏发成虽然没有看到那位朝鲜电业工人，但是他找到了来自阿吾地矿山的劳动英雄金直铉。代表团中还有在战争时期坚持科学研究工作的学者崔明鹤和桂应祥，金策工业大学的校长申健熙，他们的苍苍白发不正是显示着他们的为祖国为和平奋斗的辛劳吗？还有文艺战线上的作家黄健，作曲家李桢彦，美术家吉镇燮，他们都曾用他们的笔尖鼓舞和教育过人民狠狠地打击了敌人。还有工业、农业、青年、妇女各个战线上的领导干部，各民主党派和各人民团体的负责人。说起这三年多的战争，说起战争的最后胜利，人们不能不想起他们，更不能不感激他们。紧接着代表后面的是人民军协奏团、国立古典艺术剧场、国立艺术剧场的三百多位演员。他们也都在三年多的艰苦岁月中用他们艺术的武器打击了敌人。
    光荣啊！这些来自英雄国土上的人们，这些用自己的艰苦和牺牲换取人类和平幸福的人们！
