(Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 3rd) As the first anniversary of the death of the great Stalin approaches, workers in the Eastern European people's democratic countries have expressed their memories and longing for Stalin.

    Polish grinder worker A. Swiderski said: A year ago, our great friend, the leader of peace-loving humanity, J.V. Stalin, passed away. At that time, I felt as sad as if I had lost my father. But my comrades and I understand that Stalin has not left us. He is with us, whether in the past, present, or future. Stalin's cause is in the reliable hands of the seasoned Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Comrade Malenkov. At that time, I decided to commemorate Stalin with production achievements. In my work, I checked every operation process and tried to further shorten the time to complete each part. A month later, I completed more than 300% of the quota every day. By June 1953, I was able to announce that I had completed all my production tasks in the Six-Year Plan in three years and six months. The year after Stalin's death was not only a year in which I personally contributed to socialist construction, but also a year in which the work of all factories in Poland progressed more rapidly. Our country is now able to produce more than 3.5 million tons of steel annually. We are proud of our achievements. But we also know that without the assistance of the Soviet Union, we could never have achieved these accomplishments. We think of these aids whenever we remember Stalin's name. Today, facts prove that the enemy's idea that Stalin's death would weaken us is utterly foolish. Our peace camp is stronger than ever.
    Czech Gottwald Automobile Factory worker, recipient of the "Outstanding Work Medal," K. Miloslav, told reporters: Stalin was the mentor of progressive mankind throughout the world and our liberator. He pointed out the path of socialist labor, making it possible for us to engage in Stakhanovite labor. This situation has enabled me to carry out creative labor since 1946. To date, 40 of my proposals have been adopted, greatly helping to improve production and saving the country a lot of money. In 1952, my team alone saved the country 91 tons of steel plates because it adopted a proposal I made.

    The great Stalin bid farewell to us last year. In deep grief, I made a solemn oath to improve my work better. Now, on the first anniversary of Stalin's death, I can say without shame that I have fulfilled my promise. Due to new rationalization proposals and increased production, I received the Medal of Excellent Worker of the Ministry of Machine Industry in February this year. In order to commemorate the first anniversary of Stalin's death and to welcome the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, I have put forward a new guarantee to increase production. I hope that in the future, together with the Chinese people, we can better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, work better, and build socialism in our two countries faster.
    Hungarian Kossuth Prize winner Sang. Sucher said, I will never forget the winter of 1945, after a long period of fascist terror, when a smiling Soviet soldier said to us in Hungarian: "The Hungarian people are free." Later, the people of Lenin and Stalin brought food and clothing to hungry Budapest. Whenever I think of Comrade Stalin, many unforgettable feelings surge in my heart. I remember how my love and gratitude for him motivated my work on Stalin's 70th birthday. At that time, our country launched the Stakhanov movement, which promoted great strides in our industry. At that time, I put forward innovative suggestions to improve the operation of the 2,000-kilogram steam hammer that I had managed for more than 20 years. Therefore, in the work shift celebrating Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, my results exceeded the quota many times. I received three Stakhanov Worker Medals and won one of the highest honors of the Hungarian People's Republic - the Kossuth Prize. I once visited the Soviet Union as a member of the Hungarian delegation. When I stood on the reviewing stand in Red Square in Moscow to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration, I thought about how such a big change it was that a former blacksmith apprentice like me could stand here today! At this time, Comrade Stalin appeared on the reviewing stand, everyone's eyes turned to him, and the millions of people in the parade smiled at him. It was he who supported our country with infinitely friendly assistance and sympathy; it was he who cared during the fierce war not to let Budapest be destroyed by the stubborn resistance of the German fascists; it was he who helped us build socialism time and time again after our liberation. Like other Hungarians, I will always commemorate him with love and gratitude.
    Hungarian Rakosi factory turner and Kossuth Prize winner I. Muska said: I recall a few years ago, the unforgettable moments I spent by the side of the great Stalin. At that time, people from all over the world were congratulating him on his 70th birthday. I gathered the Hungarian people's congratulations, love and eternal gratitude into a bouquet and presented it to this genius creator in the Kremlin. I saw and personally experienced how Stalin was inextricably linked with the people. Later, although I returned to my motherland, my heart remained with the genius teacher for a long time. Three years later, the great Stalin passed away. However, the friendship between the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, which he had forged into steel, continues to strengthen. The descendants he has trained have been tempered into strong warriors. They will continue to defend the cause he left behind. Today I want to create more, better, and greater than yesterday. I feel responsible for inheriting Stalin's cause, and I want to work with the invincible peace camp of countless people to achieve the final victory of the idea of peace.
    Bulgarian Kustendil City Tobacco Factory worker and Socialist Labor Hero I. Boyanova said: A year ago, on that cold day, people heard the painful news that the mentor and leader of all progressive mankind, J.V. Stalin, bid farewell to us forever. The staff was extremely sad, and I suppressed my grief, but tears still flowed down. A year ago, in order to mourn the great Stalin, I guaranteed to complete 1,500% of the daily work quota. By the end of last year, I had achieved 1,700% of the quota.
    Bulgarian Voroshilov Factory's Dimitrov Prize winner M. Fedorov said: J.V. Stalin was a great friend of the Bulgarian people. He cared about our development and progress, and he aided our socialist construction with great strength. The factory where I work is a vivid manifestation of the friendship between the Soviet and Bulgarian peoples. The assistance given to us by the Soviet Union is invaluable. In the year after Stalin's death, Bulgarian workers worked more actively, because they remembered Stalin's teachings, to contribute everything to the complete victory of the communist cause. Now, on the production front, I often complete 150% of the daily production quota. This is my contribution to Stalin's cause.

    伟大的斯大林永远鼓舞人们前进
    【新华社布拉格三日电】在伟大的斯大林逝世一周年纪念日将要到来的时候，东欧人民民主国家的工人表示了他们对斯大林的回忆和怀念。
    波兰磨床工人爱·斯维德尔斯基说：一年前，我们伟大的朋友、爱好和平的人类的领袖约·维·斯大林与世长辞了。我当时感到好像失去了父亲一样的悲痛。但是我和我的同志们懂得斯大林并没有离开我们，无论是过去、现在和将来，他都是和我们在一起的。斯大林的事业是掌握在以马林科夫同志为首的、久经锻炼的苏联共产党中央的可靠的手里。当时我决定：要以生产成就来纪念斯大林。我在工作中检查每一个操作过程，设法进一步缩短完成每个零件的时间。一个月以后，我每天完成了定额百分之三百以上。到一九五三年六月，我已能宣布我用三年零六个月时间完成了我在六年计划中的全部生产任务。斯大林逝世后的一年，不仅是我个人为社会主义建设立功的一年，同时也是波兰一切工厂的工作更迅速进步的一年。我国现在已能每年生产三百五十万吨以上的钢。我们为我们的成就而骄傲。但是我们也知道，如果没有苏联的援助，我们决不可能获得这些成就。我们一想到斯大林的名字，就想到了这些援助。今天，事实证明：敌人以为斯大林逝世会使我们削弱的想法是十分愚蠢的。我们和平阵营是比以往任何时候都更强大了。
    捷克斯洛伐克哥特瓦尔德汽车工厂的工人、“杰出工作勋章”获得者克·米洛斯拉夫向记者说：斯大林是全世界进步人类的导师，又是我们的解放者。他指出了以社会主义方式进行劳动的道路，使我们也有可能进行斯大哈诺夫式的劳动。这种情况使我从一九四六年起，就进行了创造性的劳动。到现在，我提出的建议已有四十条被采纳，大大帮助了生产的提高，为国家节省了大量资金。在一九五二年，单是我的工作队就因为采用了我提出的一个建议，为国家节省了九十一吨钢板。
    伟大的斯大林在去年和我们永别了。我在十分悲痛之余，提出了庄严的宣誓，要更好地改进工作。现在在斯大林逝世一周年的时候，我可以毫无愧色地说：我实现了我的保证。由于提出新的合理化建议和提高生产，我在今年二月获得了机器工业部的最优工作者勋章。为了纪念斯大林逝世一周年和迎接捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会，我已经提出了新的增加生产的保证。我希望今后和中国人民一起，更好地学习苏联的先进经验，更好地工作，使我们两国更快地建成社会主义。
    匈牙利科苏特奖金得奖人桑·苏切尔说，我永远不会忘记在经过长期的法西斯恐怖统治后的一九四五年冬天，有一个微笑着的苏联兵士用匈牙利语对我们说：“匈牙利人民自由了。”后来，列宁和斯大林的人民给饥饿的布达佩斯带来了粮食和衣服。每当我想起斯大林同志的时候，我心中都激荡起许许多多难忘的情意。我记得在斯大林七十寿辰时，我对他的热爱和感谢怎样推动了我的工作。那时候我国展开了推动我们工业大踏步前进的斯大哈诺夫运动。当时，我提出了革新建议，来改进我已经管理了二十多年的两千公斤重的汽鎚的操作。因此，在庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰的工作班中，我的成绩超过了定额许多倍。我得到三枚斯大哈诺夫工作者奖章，并获得匈牙利人民共和国最高荣誉之一——科苏特奖金。我曾作为匈牙利代表团的一员访问过苏联。当我站在莫斯科红场的观礼台上，参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝典礼时，我想到像我这样一个过去的铁匠学徒今天竟能站在这里，这该是多么大的变化啊！这时斯大林同志在检阅台上出现了，每个人的眼睛都转向他，游行的千百万人民都朝着他微笑。是他用无限友好的援助和同情支持了我们的国家；是他在激烈的战争中还关心不要让布达佩斯毁灭于德国法西斯顽固的抵抗下；是他在我国解放以后一次又一次地帮助我们建设社会主义。我同其他匈牙利人一样，永远怀着热爱和感激的心情纪念他。
    匈牙利拉科西工厂车工、科苏特奖金获得者伊·穆斯卡说：我回想起几年以前，我在伟大的斯大林的身旁所度过的难忘的时刻。那时，世界各国人民正祝贺他的七十寿辰。我把匈牙利人民的祝贺、热爱和永远的感激，聚集成为花束，在克里姆林宫里献给了这位天才的创造者。我看到并亲身体会到斯大林如何与人民血肉相联，不可分离。后来我虽然回到了祖国，但我的心却长期留在天才导师的身边。三年后，伟大的斯大林逝世了。但是他所锤炼成钢的苏联、中国和人民民主国家的友谊，却在继续加强。他所培养的后代，已锻炼成为坚强的战士。他们将继续保卫着他所遗留下来的事业。今天我要比昨天创造得更多、更好、更伟大。我感到有责任继承斯大林的事业，我要和拥有无数人的不可战胜的和平阵营一起，使和平的思想获得最后的胜利。
    保加利亚库斯顿第尔城烟草工厂女工、社会主义劳动英雄伊·波伊安诺娃说：一年前，在那寒冷的日子里，人们听到了沉痛的消息，全体进步人类的导师和领袖约·维·斯大林和我们永别了。职工们无比悲痛，我压抑着悲哀，但眼泪还是流下来了。一年前，为了悼念伟大的斯大林，我保证每日完成工作定额百分之一千五百。到去年年底，我已达到了定额百分之一千七百的成绩。
    保加利亚伏罗希洛夫工厂的季米特洛夫奖金获得者麦·费尔多夫说：约·维·斯大林是保加利亚人民的伟大朋友，他关心我们的发展和进步，他用巨大力量援助我们进行社会主义建设。我所服务的工厂就是保苏两国人民友谊的生动的表现。苏联给予我们的援助是不可估价的。在斯大林逝世后的一年里，保加利亚工人工作得更积极了，因为他们记得斯大林的遗训，要为共产主义事业的彻底胜利贡献出一切。现在，我在生产战线上，经常完成每日生产定额的百分之一百五十，这就是我对斯大林的事业所作的贡献。
