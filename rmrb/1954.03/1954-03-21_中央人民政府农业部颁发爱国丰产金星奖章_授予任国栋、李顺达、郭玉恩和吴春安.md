    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government recently awarded the 1952 "Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal." The recipients of this medal are: model worker Ren Guodong, labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an.
    After the conclusion of the 1952 Patriotic Production Increase Movement, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, after careful review and evaluation, decided to award the "Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal" to Ren Guodong, Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an. Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng announced at the National Agricultural Work Conference on January 15 this year that the medals had been made and entrusted the People's Government Chairman of Shanxi Province, Pei Lisheng, and the Director of the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Du Zhehegn, to award them separately.
    On February 13th, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government convened more than 1,200 farmer representatives from the province who were visiting workers in Taiyuan to hold a grand award ceremony. Chairman Pei Lisheng personally pinned the medals on the chests of Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Chun'an, and encouraged them to guard against arrogance and rashness, further play their leading, backbone, and bridging roles, and continue to promote agricultural production increase. In his speech, Chairman Pei Lisheng pointed out that Li Shunda and others had recognized the path of socialist transformation of agriculture, responded to Chairman Mao's call very early on, and led farmers to implement mutual aid and cooperation. They attached great importance to production reform, learned advanced technologies, and constantly innovated technologies, achieving bumper harvests. They have pointed out the direction for production increases in both mountainous and plain areas. At the meeting, Wang Kui, a worker from the Shanxi Machine Factory, and Li Kuizhong, a farmer from Huguan County, also delivered congratulatory speeches to the three of them on behalf of the workers and farmers of the province.
    On February 18th, at the Sixth Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference in Heilongjiang Province, a grand award ceremony was also held. Liu Yongchuan, Director of the Agricultural Machinery Station Management Office of the Northeast Administrative Committee Agricultural Bureau, read the letter of entrustment from Minister of Agriculture Li Shucheng of the Central Government and awarded the Gold Star Medal to Comrade Ren Guodong.
    The comrades who received the awards all expressed that, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, they would continue to work hard to improve agricultural production to meet the needs of the country and the people. Ren Guodong stated that he would further strengthen ties with the masses, promote a thorough research style, further develop and consolidate mutual aid and cooperation, and widely carry out mass technical production increase movements. Li Shunda and others stated that they would work harder to run agricultural production cooperatives well, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, and obey the needs of the national plan to produce more grain and cotton.
    Note: Comrade Ren Guodong is the Secretary of the Qi Party Committee of Gorlos Later Banner (formerly Zhaoyuan County) in Heilongjiang Province. Because he went deep among the masses to explore the potential for agricultural production increase, summarized local production increase experiences, and proposed measures such as "equal spacing, wide sowing, thinning, and seedling protection," he achieved a 50% increase in production for the entire county in 1952. In 1953, the Zhaoyuan bumper harvest experience was widely promoted throughout the Northeast region, increasing grain production by approximately one million tons.
    Li Shunda led all members of the Xigou Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in launching a patriotic production increase competition throughout the country in the spring of 1952, overfulfilling the production plan. The cooperative's 167.8 mu of land produced an average of 372 jin of grain per mu, exceeding pre-war levels by 104.5% and exceeding the local average yield by 77.2%. By combining agriculture with the development of forestry and animal husbandry according to local conditions, the cooperative changed the face of Xigou Village and created experience in developing production in mountainous areas.
    Guo Yu'en is the head of the Chuandi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County. In 1952, he led the entire cooperative to improve internal management, implement labor quotas, and contract work and production, improving labor efficiency and achieving comprehensive bumper harvests. The cooperative's 241.9 mu of autumn fields yielded an average of 480.5 jin per mu, an increase of 128.6% compared to pre-war levels and exceeding the local average yield by 60.3%.
    Wu Chun'an is the head of the Xiliang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province. In 1952, he responded to the government's call, learned cotton planting science and technology and advanced experience, and achieved bumper harvests. The cooperative's 118.8 mu of irrigated and dry cotton fields yielded an average of 472 jin of seed cotton per mu, exceeding the previous year's average yield by 70% and exceeding the local individual farmers' average yield by 150%. Among them, there were 5 mu of high-yield land, yielding an average of 1,021.6 jin of seed cotton per mu, setting a new national record for the highest cotton yield at the time.
    The average grain yield of Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en's areas were both barren mountainous areas, their average grain yields exceeding the average grain yield per mu in Shanxi Province in 1953 by more than two times. Wu Chun'an's average cotton yield also exceeded the average cotton yield in Shanxi Province in 1953 by more than two times. (Attached pictures) Patriotic Production Gold Star Medal

    中央人民政府农业部颁发爱国丰产金星奖章
    授予任国栋、李顺达、郭玉恩和吴春安
     【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部于最近颁发了一九五二年“爱国丰产金星奖章”。荣获此项奖章的有：模范工作者任国栋、劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安四人。
    一九五二年爱国丰产运动结束以后，中央农业部经过慎重地审查、评定，决定颁发“爱国丰产金星奖章”，奖给任国栋、李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安四人。农业部部长李书城于今年一月十五日在全国农业工作会议上宣布：奖章业已制就，并以委托书分别委托山西省人民政府主席裴丽生及东北行政委员会农业局局长杜者蘅代为颁发。
    二月十三日，山西省人民政府召集全省到太原访问工人的农民代表一千二百多人，举行隆重的授奖大会，裴丽生主席亲自把奖章挂在李顺达、郭玉恩、吴春安三人胸前，并勉励他们戒骄戒傲，进一步发挥带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用，继续促进农业增产。裴丽生主席讲话中指出李顺达等人认清了农业社会主义改造的道路，很早以前就响应毛主席的号召，带领农民实行互助合作；他们十分重视生产改革，学习先进技术，并不断革新技术，获得丰产，他们对山区和平原的增产都指明了方向。会上，山西机器厂工人王奎、壶关县农民李魁忠并代表全省工人和农民向他们三人致词道贺。
    二月十八日，在黑龙江省第六届农业劳动模范代表会议上，也举行了隆重的授奖仪式，由东北行政委员会农业局农机站管理处处长刘泳川宣读了中央农业部部长李书城的委托书，并把金星奖章授予任国栋同志。
    受奖的同志们都表示：在党和人民政府的领导下，要继续努力提高农业生产，以满足国家和人民的需要。任国栋表示：今后要更加密切联系群众，发扬深入研究的作风，进一步发展和巩固互助合作，广泛开展群众性的技术增产运动。李顺达等表示：要更加努力办好农业生产合作社，加强工农联盟，并服从国家计划需要，生产更多的粮棉。
    按：任国栋同志是中共黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗（原肇源县）旗委书记，由于他深入群众发掘农业增产潜力，总结当地增产经验，提出“等距、宽播、间苗、保苗”等措施，获得了一九五二年全县增产百分之五十的成绩。一九五三年东北全区普遍推广肇源丰产经验，共约增产粮食一百万吨。
    李顺达领导山西平顺县西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社全体社员，在一九五二年春天向全国发起爱国丰产竞赛运动，超额完成生产计划，全社一百六十七亩八分地每亩平均产粮三百七十二斤，超过战前百分之一百零四点五，超过当地平均产量百分之七十七点二。并因地制宜地结合农业发展林牧业，改变了西沟村的面貌，创造了山地发展生产的经验。
    郭玉恩是平顺县川底村农业生产合作社社长，一九五二年领导全社改进社内经营管理，实行劳动定额、包工包产的办法，提高劳动效率，获得全面丰产。全社二百四十一亩九分秋田，每亩平均产量四百八十零半斤，比战前提高百分之一百二十八点六，超过当地平均产量百分之六十点三。
    吴春安是山西翼城县西梁村农业生产合作社社长，一九五二年响应政府号召，学习了植棉的科学技术与先进经验，获得丰产。全社水旱棉田共一百一十八亩八分，平均每亩收籽棉四百七十二斤，超过前一年平均产量百分之七十，超过当地个体农户每亩平均产量百分之一百五十。其中有丰产地五亩，每亩平均收籽棉一千零二十一斤六两，创造了当时全国棉花最高产量的新纪录。
    李顺达、郭玉恩所在地区都是贫瘠山区，他们的粮食平均产量都超过山西省一九五三年粮食每亩平均产量两倍以上。吴春安的棉花平均产量也超过一九五三年山西全省棉花平均产量两倍以上。（附图片）爱国丰产金星奖章
