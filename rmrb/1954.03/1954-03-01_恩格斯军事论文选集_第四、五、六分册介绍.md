Due to the needs of the revolution, Engels enthusiastically devoted himself to the study of military issues. Engels was an outstanding military expert. His writings on military theory and policy, military history, tactics, and military technology are a treasure trove of human knowledge and a great contribution of Marxism to the military field.

Engels' main works on military affairs were written in the 1850s to 1870s. In terms of military theory and policy, there are: "The Possibilities and Prerequisites of a War Against France by the Holy Alliance," "The Po and the Rhine," "Savoy, Nice and the Rhine," etc.; in terms of army and military technology, there are: "The Army," "Infantry," "Cavalry," "Artillery," "Fortification," "The Fleet," "The European Armies," "History of the Rifle," etc.; in terms of tactics, there are: "Attack," "Battle," "Mountain Warfare," etc.; in terms of war history and military commentary, there are: "The Eastern War of 1853-1856," "The Indian Uprising of 1858," "The Italian War of 1859," "The American Civil War of 1861," "The Austro-Prussian War of 1866," "The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871," etc.

Whether in military theory, tactical principles, or military technology, Engels based his work on the Marxist dialectical materialist viewpoint. He laid the foundation for the Marxist doctrine of war and the army, explaining the relationship between war and the economy, that is, the relationship with the mode of production and the structure of social classes. He pointed out: "Nothing is so closely dependent on economic conditions as the army and navy. Armament, composition, organisation, tactics and strategy depend above all upon the stage reached at any given time in production and communications." ("The Role of Violence in History," People's Publishing House edition, page 122) He taught us that the organization and combat methods of the army are also based on material, that is, economic conditions.

Regarding the development of tactics and military technology, Engels also analyzed it from a Marxist perspective. He said: "The wars of the American and French Revolutions brought about a tremendous change in tactics. Since these wars, a certain battle formation has emerged: the combination of skirmishers in the front and columns in the rear has become the basic and special form of modern warfare. The main force is used for maneuvering in order to concentrate on any point of the enemy; they are only thrown into battle at the moment of decisive battle. At this time, the skirmishers... carry out uninterrupted combat on the front line. They expend many bullets, and they rarely shoot at targets exceeding the front of a company; and in many cases, they have to shoot at individual soldiers who are well concealed." ("Selected Military Writings of Engels," Russian edition, Volume 1) Therefore, it is necessary to improve the rifle to meet this development. Engels explained here that the new mode of production led to changes in tactical principles, and the adoption of new tactics led to the improvement of weapons. Therefore, in the final analysis, whether it is the development of combat methods or the improvement of military technology, it is based on a certain mode of production.

The "Selected Military Writings of Engels" Volumes Four, Five, and Six, published by the People's Publishing House, contain some military essays written by Engels in the 1850s to 1870s on national wars. Most of these papers are commentaries written by Engels on military events at the time during the course of the war, and most of them were published anonymously in British and American newspapers.

In these essays, we can see that Engels has extremely deep attainments not only in military theory and policy, but also in military history, military technology, strategy, and tactics. Standing on the position of the proletariat, with a clear dialectical materialist viewpoint, rich and profound knowledge, and extraordinary insight, he correctly analyzed and predicted the development process of the events at the time through the complex and not fully developed political and military situation at the time, and through some few, untimely, and incorrect reports in the bourgeois newspapers.

From these military essays, we can see the following characteristics.

Engels had a very clear understanding of the nature and role of these wars, and therefore his attitude towards the participating countries, that is, his attitude towards the war, was extremely clear. The Eastern War of 1853 was caused by the aggressive policies of Tsarist Russia and Britain, France, and their vassal Turkey. Engels pointed out the nature of this war from the beginning. He believed that this war was "a war of religious fanaticism for both sides," and therefore unjust on both sides. He strictly criticized the corrupt military system and incomprehensible combat methods of both sides. In the Italian War of 1859, Engels sarcastically ridiculed Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and Emperor Louis Napoleon of France, saying that they were two "famous opponents" who were good at boasting themselves but actually incompetent in commanding operations. On the other hand, Engels greatly praised the insurgent army, the guerrillas led by Garibaldi, believing that it was a force not to be underestimated, and praised Garibaldi himself as a "hero with extraordinary military genius, courage, and resourcefulness." In the American Civil War of 1861, Engels also sympathized with the Northern Army with the same clear position, because it was a "war against slave owners." Engels believed that in this war, although the Northern Army was initially at a disadvantage, it would gradually achieve victory due to the active participation of the people and continuous training in small battles. But what best shows Engels' clear attitude towards war is his commentary on the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. In this war, due to the change in the nature of the war, Engels' attitude also changed significantly, he changed from sympathy for Germany at the beginning to sympathy for France. This war was caused by the aggressive policies of Louis Napoleon, and on the German side it was a progressive war of self-defense, carried out for the unification of the nation. Therefore, at this time, Engels strongly criticized the corrupt politics of the Second Empire. Later, when Louis Napoleon was captured in Sedan and the Second Empire was declared dissolved, the German army continued to wage war even though it had lost its operational goals. Obviously, at this time, the German army was unjust, and was at odds with the French people. Therefore, Engels no longer sympathized with Germany, but called for "how to defeat the Prussian army," encouraging the French people to strengthen resistance and continue fighting.

Secondly, Engels' estimation and criticism of the combat plans of the warring parties in these essays are completely correct. We know that it is very difficult to estimate the combat plan of one side at the beginning of a war. In the Italian War, Engels correctly estimated the Austrian army's combat plan, believing that the Austrian army should take advantage of the opportunity to launch an offensive and eliminate the Piedmontese army before the French army could reinforce it. However, the Austrian army did not come up with this plan, "and thus missed this favorable opportunity, causing them to face an allied army that was completely equal to them in number, and the latter gradually exceeded them in number every day; at the same time, the Austrian army did not take the offensive and advance victoriously, so they were likely to be quickly forced to retreat behind the Mincio River, where they would take a purely defensive posture under the cover of their large fortress." Subsequent events completely confirmed Engels' estimate. In the American Civil War, Engels analyzed the different situations of the southern and northern states, pointing out that "the southern states can only expect victory in the case of a rapid, courageous, and almost bold offensive," otherwise, "their position will inevitably deteriorate." As for the northern states, he believed that their strategy "lies in initially conducting defense only at all decisive points, organizing their forces, not involving them in large battles, but training them with small battles, so that later when the organization is fully consolidated and the army has more or less purged the rebels, they can turn to vigorous and unremitting offensives." Such an estimate is also completely correct. In the Austro-Prussian War, Engels strictly criticized the Prussian army's plan, believing that they dispersed their forces, making it impossible for them to support each other, and met along different roads within the range that the enemy army could reach, which violated strategic principles, and this could only achieve victory if the enemy was unprepared or acted slowly. And Moltke's bold plan did indeed achieve victory in this way. In the Franco-Prussian War, Engels' correct estimation of the combat plans of the French and Prussian armies was even more astonishing. At the beginning of the war, he believed that the deployment of the French army was very good, and most of the troops were deployed near the border. If they could quickly take the offensive before the German army was fully concentrated, either crossing the Saar River in Lorraine or crossing the Rhine River in Alsace, they could arbitrarily march north or east. However, due to the corruption of the Second Empire and the incompetence of Louis Napoleon, the French army delayed in holding back, allowing the Prussian army to concentrate superior forces to defeat the French army, encircling part of the French army in Metz and part near Sedan on the Franco-Belgian border. In such a situation, Engels clarified some unrealistic reports at the time, saw through the Prussian army's feint of "resolutely marching towards Paris," and correctly predicted the fate of the French army eight days before the surrender at Sedan, and even his estimation of the places where battles might occur was correct.

In these essays, Engels also constantly put forward some strategic and tactical issues. In criticizing the plan adopted by the Prussian army in the Austro-Prussian War, he pointed out two basic principles of strategy: first, do not disperse forces so that they cannot support each other; second, when advancing along different roads, the columns should meet at locations outside the range that the enemy army can reach. In terms of tactics, he pointed out in his commentary on the Italian War that "generally speaking, there are only three types of attacks: either directly attack the front in order to break through the center, or attack with a flanking maneuver on the right wing, or attack with a flanking maneuver on the left wing." Regarding defense, his proposition is positive. He demanded that the entire fortress area be utilized with an offensive defense carried out internally and assisted externally in the same direction. His view of pursuit is also typical, he said: "The fruits of victory are usually obtained in the pursuit of the enemy. The more vigorous the pursuit, the greater the victory." Engels talked more about the siege tactics of fortresses. In the Eastern War, he talked about the sieges of Silistria and Sevastopol, in the Italian War, he talked about the siege of the "Quadrilateral Fortress Area," and in the Franco-Prussian War, he talked about the sieges of Metz and Paris, and put forward methods for conducting a formal siege.

However, the significance of these military essays by Engels is not limited to this. In some essays, he also talked about military technology and army organization, that is, the changes in military art. For example, Engels has insightful analyses on the development of fortification, the improvement of rifles, and the rise and fall of the armies of major European countries (Germany, France, Britain, Russia, Austria, etc.). As for the value of these essays in terms of military history, that is even more valuable. Because Engels' analysis of military events is often unfolded against the background of past relevant war history.

Finally, the end of Volume Six also excerpts the preface written by Engels for Borkheim's book "Memoirs of a Blood-and-Iron Patriot of Germany, 1806-1807." Engels correctly predicted the scene of the First World War here. He said, "...in the end, except for a world war..., there will be no other war for Prussia-Germany. Eight million to ten million soldiers will kill each other, and in this massacre, they will devour the entire Europe more severely than a swarm of locusts. The ravages of the Thirty Years' War will gather in three or four years and spread to the entire European continent." What a correct prediction!

Overall, in these essays, Engels not only made profound expositions on the nature and significance of war with his clear class stance and high political accomplishments, and not only made correct estimations of many future events and the combat plans of the warring countries with his high attainments in military theory, but also enriched his arguments with his rich knowledge of strategy, tactics, and military technology, by taking various factors (from the area of the country, the number of people, the character or experience of the general, to the advantages and disadvantages of the terrain, and even the amount of horse meat in the besieged city) into the background when analyzing military events. Engels' military essays are the brilliant masterpieces of Marxist military science.

    “恩格斯军事论文选集”第四、五、六分册介绍

    由于革命的需要，恩格斯曾热情地致力于军事问题的研究。恩格斯是一位卓越的军事专家。他在军事理论及政策方面，在战史、战术和军事技术方面的著作，是人类知识的宝库，是马克思主义在军事方面的伟大贡献。
    恩格斯关于军事方面的主要著作，是在十九世纪五十到七十年代写成的。在军事理论及政策方面有：“神圣同盟对法战争的可能及前提”、“波河与莱茵河”、“萨瓦亚、尼斯与莱茵”等；在军队及军事技术方面有：“军队”、“步兵”、“骑兵”、“炮兵”、“筑城”、“舰队”、“欧洲军队”、“步枪史”等；在战术方面有：“进攻”、“会战”、“山地战”等；在战史及军事评论方面有：“一八五三—一八五六年东方战争”、“一八五八年印度起义”、“一八五九年意大利战争”、“一八六一年美国内战”、“一八六六年普奥战争”、“一八七○—一八七一年普法战争”等。
    恩格斯无论在军事理论方面，或者是在战术原则以及军事技术方面，都是以马克思主义辩证唯物论的观点为依据的。他奠定了马克思主义关于战争和军队的学说的基础，说明了战争与经济的关系，也就是与生产方式和社会阶级结构的关系。他指出：“任何东西没有像军队和舰队那样休戚相关地依附于经济条件之上。武装、编制、组织、战术、战略等等首先依存于各个时代的生产程度和交通状况。”（“暴力在历史中的作用”，人民出版社版，第一二二页）他教导我们说，军队的组织和战斗方式也是以物质的，也就是以经济的条件为基础的。
    关于战术和军事技术的发展，恩格斯也是以马克思主义的观点来加以分析的。他说：“美国和法国革命的战争引起了战术的巨大变化。自从这些战争以后，就出现了某种战斗队形：先头的散兵线和后方的纵队的配合就成为现代战斗的基本的特殊的形式。主力用以进行机动以便在敌人任何一点上集中；他们只有在决战时机才投入战斗。而在这时候，散兵线……则在前线进行不间断的战斗。他们消耗许多子弹，而他们射击的目标很少超过连的正面；并且在许多场合，他们还不得不向掩蔽得很好的个别士兵射击。”（“恩格斯军事论文选集”，俄文版，第一卷）因此，就要求改善步枪来满足这一发展。恩格斯在这里说明了：新的生产方式引起了战术原则的改变，而新的战术的采用又引起了武器的改良。所以，归根结柢，无论是作战方法的发展，或者是军事技术的改进，都是以一定的生产方式为其基础的。
    人民出版社出版的“恩格斯军事论文选集”第四、五、六分册中收录的是恩格斯在十九世纪五十到七十年代关于民族战争所写的一些军事论文。这些论文大部分是恩格斯在战争进行过程中对当时军事事件所写的评论，多数以匿名发表在英美的报纸上。
    在这些论文中，我们可以看到恩格斯不仅在军事理论及政策方面，而且在战史方面以及军事技术、战略、战术等方面，都有极深的造诣。他站在无产阶级的立场上，以明确的辩证唯物论的观点、丰富而渊博的知识和非凡的洞察力，透过当时复杂而尚未完全展开的政治及军事形势，透过资产阶级报纸一些很少的、不及时的、观点不正确的报道，正确地分析和预见了当时事变发展的进程。
    从这些军事论文中，我们可以看到下列几个特点。
    恩格斯对这些战争的性质和作用，是认识得非常清楚的，因而对参战国家的态度，也就是对战争的态度，是极端明确的。一八五三年的东方战争是由于沙皇俄国和英、法及其附庸土耳其的侵略政策所引起的。恩格斯在一开始就指出这一次战争的性质。他认为，这一次战争“对于双方是宗教的狂热底战争”，因而在双方都是非正义的。他严格地批判了双方腐败的军事制度和不可理喻的作战方法。在一八五九年意大利战争中，恩格斯辛辣地讽刺了奥皇法兰兹·约瑟夫和法皇路易拿破仑，说他们两个是“驰名的对头”，都是善于吹嘘自己而实际上无指挥作战能力的庸才。另一方面，恩格斯却极力赞许起义的军队，加里波的所率领的游击队，认为这是一支不可轻侮的力量，并称赞加里波的本人是“禀有非常军事天才、富有胆量和足智多谋的英雄”。在一八六一年的美国内战中，恩格斯也是以同样显明的立场同情北军的，因为这是一个“反奴隶主的战争”。恩格斯认为在这个战争中，北军虽开始处于劣势，但逐渐由于人民积极的参加和在小战斗中不断的训练，终于一定会取得胜利的。但最能看出恩格斯对战争的明确的态度的，还是他对一八七○——一八七一年普法战争的评论。在这一战争中，由于战争性质的改变，恩格斯的态度也有显然的改变，他从开始对德国的同情转为对法国的同情。这次战争是由路易拿破仑的侵略政策引起的，在德国方面则是自卫的，为了统一民族而进行的进步的战争。因此，恩格斯在这个时候，极力批判第二帝国的腐败政治。及至以后，路易拿破仑在色当被俘，第二帝国已宣告解体，而德军在已失去作战的目标时仍然继续进行战争。显然，德军在这个时候，就是非正义的了，就是与法国人民为敌的了。因此，恩格斯便不再同情德国，而呼吁“如何击败普军”，鼓励法国人民加强抵抗，继续战斗。
    其次，恩格斯在这些论文中对于交战双方作战计划的估计和批判是完全正确的。我们知道，在战争发生的开初，要估计一方作战计划是很不容易的。在意大利战争中，恩格斯正确地估计了奥军的作战计划，认为奥军应利用先机之利，发动攻势，在法军未及增援皮蒙特军之前，先消灭后者。但奥军计不出此，“因而逸失了这个有利的机会，致使和一个在数量上完全和他们相等的联军对敌，并且后者每天逐渐在数量上超过他们；同时奥军又不采取攻势而乘胜前进，所以他们很可能迅速地甚至被逼放弃米兰而向门其阿河背后撤退，在那里，他们将在他们大的要塞底掩护下单纯采取守势”。以后的事变完全证实了恩格斯的这一估计。在美国内战中，恩格斯对于南部诸州及北部诸州的不同情况作了分析，指出“南部诸州只有在迅速、勇敢而几乎近于大胆的进攻底场合才能期待到胜利”，否则，“他们底地位不可避免地会日渐恶化”。至于北部诸州，他认为，他们的策略“在于起初在一切决定的地点只进行防御，组织自己的力量，不把它们牵入大的战斗中而以小的战斗训练它们，以便在以后当组织被充分巩固而军队或多或少肃清了叛变分子的时候转为奋力的、不懈怠的进攻”。这样的估计也是完全正确的。在普奥战争中，恩格斯严格地批
  判了普军的计划，认为他们分散兵力，使之不能互
  相支援，而且沿不同的道路在敌军可能到达的范围内会合，这是违反战略原则的，这个只有在敌军无准备或行动迂缓的情形下才能取得胜利。而毛奇这一大胆的计划的确也正是这样取得胜利的。在普法战争中，恩格斯对于法军和普军作战计划的正确估计更是惊人的。在开战之初，他认为，法军的部署是很好的，大部军队都配备于国境附近，如能于德军尚未完全集中之前，迅速采取攻势，或者在洛林渡过萨尔河，或者在亚尔萨斯渡过莱茵河，他们就可以任意或者向北进军，或者向东进军。但是由于第二帝国的腐败和路易拿破仑的无能，法军迟迟按兵不动，使普军得以集中优势兵力击败了法军，把法军一部分包围于麦次，一部分包围于法比边境的色当附近。在这样情形下，恩格斯澄清了当时一些不切实际的报道，识破了普军扬言“坚决向巴黎进军”的阳动，在色当投降前八日正确地预见了法军的命运，甚至对于可能发生战斗的场所的估计都是正确的。
    在这些论文中，恩格斯还不断地提出了一些战略和战术的问题。在批判普奥战争中普军所采取的计划时，他指出两个战略的基本原则：第一，不能分散兵力，使之不能互相支援；第二，在沿不同的道路前进时，各纵队应在敌军可能到达的范围以外的地点会合。在战术方面，他在评论意大利战争中指出，“一般地来说，只有三种攻击法：或者直接向正面攻击以便突破中央，或者以右翼迂回或者以左翼迂回来进行攻击”。关于防御，他的主张是积极的。他要求以一种内部所进行的而为外部在同一方向所援助的攻势防御来整个利用要塞地区。他对于追击的看法也是典型的，他说：“战果普通是在追击敌人的情形下才能得到的。追击愈有力，则胜利愈大”。对于要塞的围攻战术，恩格斯谈得比较多，在东方战争中谈到西里斯特利亚和塞巴斯托波尔的围攻，在意大利战争中谈到“四边形要塞地”的围攻，在普法战争中谈到麦次和巴黎的围攻，提出了如何进行正规围攻的方法。
    但是，恩格斯的这些军事论文的意义还不仅此。他在一些论文中还谈到了军事技术和军队组织，也就是说军事艺术的变迁。例如，关于筑城的发展，步枪的改进，欧洲各大国家（德、法、英、俄、奥等国）军队的兴衰，恩格斯都有精辟的分析。至于这些论文在战史方面的价值，那更是可贵的。因为恩格斯对于军事事件的分析很多都是以过去有关战史为背景而展开的。
    最后，第六分册末后还节录了恩格斯为波尔克海姆所著“对于一八○六—一八○七年德意志铁血爱国者的回忆”一书所写的序文。恩格斯在这里正确地预见了第一次世界大战的情景。他说，“……最后除了一种世界战争……以外，对于普鲁士—德意志再不会有其他任何的战争了。八百万到一千万的兵士将要互相屠杀，而在这个屠杀中，他们将要比一群蝗虫还要厉害地吞噬整个欧洲。三十年战争底蹂躏将集聚于三四年中，蔓延到全部欧洲大陆”。这是何等正确的预言！
    总起来说，恩格斯在这些论文里，不仅以其明确的阶级立场，高深的政治修养，对于战争的性质和意义作了深刻的阐述，也不仅以他在军事理论方面高深的修养，对于许多未来事件和交战国的作战计划作了正确的估计，而且以他在战略战术和军事技术方面丰富的知识，在分析军事事件的时候以各种因素（从国家的面积，人口的多寡、将军的性格或经历，以至于地形之利与不利、被围城市马肉的多少）的作用为背景，而丰富了他的论据。恩格斯的军事论文是马克思主义军事科学的天才杰作。
