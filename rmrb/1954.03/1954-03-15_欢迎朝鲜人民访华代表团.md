    The delegation of the Korean people sent by the Korean Democratic Fatherland Front has arrived in Beijing, our capital city, yesterday. Our people express their heartfelt and warm welcome to the friendly visit of the brotherly Korean people's delegation.
    The glorious Korean people have undergone severe war tests in the great struggle to defend their national independence and oppose the American aggressors. They have demonstrated an indomitable heroic spirit. With the help and support of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, they defeated the armed aggression of the most powerful imperialism of modern times and achieved the great victory of the Korean armistice. It is precisely because of the Korean people's staunch, unyielding, and selfless heroic struggle, and because of the victory won by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side, that our people can safely carry out large-scale construction. The Korean people's assistance to our country and their contribution to the cause of peace in Asia and the world are of great significance.
    Since the Korean armistice, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, and with the extensive international support of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, the Korean people have completed the preparations for economic recovery in just five months and began implementing the three-year plan for the restoration and development of the economy in January this year. At present, all factories under the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as many other important enterprises, have resumed production, with coal production having doubled compared to pre-war levels. Many important cities are undergoing reconstruction, some new factories have been established, and the people's lives have seen preliminary improvements. This vibrant and thriving construction scene in northern Korea stands in stark contrast to the collapsing economy of South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee gang and the plight of its people. The rapid progress of the Korean people's work in restoring the national economy has greatly strengthened the democratic base of Korea and increased the material strength of the Korean people's just cause in striving for the reunification of the country on a democratic basis and consolidating lasting peace in Korea and Asia.
    Our people and the Korean people have not only forged an unbreakable friendship with blood in the struggle against a common enemy, but have also demonstrated a spirit of further strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation in healing the wounds of the Korean War and restoring the economic undertakings of the Korean people. Last November, the Korean government delegation led by Premier Kim Il-sung held friendly talks with our government in Beijing and concluded the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, which is a clear sign of the major development of the mutual assistance and cooperation between our two governments and peoples.
    The further development and consolidation of the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese and Korean people, as well as the common determination of the two peoples to strive for the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, have been met with sympathy and support from the entire peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world. This has made the forces defending peace ever stronger, while making the US ruling clique, which is attempting to maintain international tension in Korea and the Far East, increasingly isolated. After the Korean armistice, the US ruling clique and the Syngman Rhee clique of South Korea have tried every means to sabotage the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, undermine the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," forcibly detain prisoners of war, and obstruct the convening of the Korean Political Conference, creating a stalemate in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the Chinese and Korean people, as well as peace-loving people from all countries, will not allow this situation to continue. In particular, the firm efforts made by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions have forced the United States to agree to hold the Geneva Conference at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the final resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    However, it is an undeniable fact that after the Berlin Conference, the US ruling clique is still trying to strengthen its interference in the Indochina War and attempting to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. While the US propaganda machine is spreading pessimistic views about the Geneva Conference, it is vigorously promoting the idea that "Korea will remain indefinitely divided along the current demarcation line." The US military authorities in Korea are violating the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement by illegally transporting reinforcements of weapons and aircraft into South Korea, while expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army, increasing the number of puppet troops in South Korea to twenty divisions. Syngman Rhee, who has consistently clamored for the destruction of the Korean armistice with the support of US reactionary forces, recently shouted that he wants to "march north." This shows that the US ruling clique in Korea, as in other parts of the world, is still unwilling to abandon its policy of creating international tensions and preparing for new wars.
    Therefore, the important task facing the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people around the world is to raise vigilance, strengthen unity, expose the conspiracies of the US ruling clique, promote the smooth convening of the Geneva Conference, and wage a persistent struggle for the final resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.
    In this situation, our welcome today to the delegation of the Korean people to visit China is of particular significance. The delegation of the Korean people will visit our country for three months, conveying the Korean people's warm feelings towards our people, introducing the construction work carried out by the heroic Korean people to restore the national economy, and visiting the construction achievements of our people. The meeting between the Korean people's representatives and our people will further exchange the friendly feelings and fighting experience between the two peoples, which will undoubtedly further enhance the great and noble fighting friendship between the two peoples. The more the friendship between our two peoples is strengthened, the more the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union will increase. We believe that the visit of the Korean people's delegation to our country will achieve great success.

### 欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团

    欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线所派遣的朝鲜人民访华代表团，已于昨日到达我国首都北京。我国人民对兄弟般的朝鲜人民代表团的友谊访问，衷心地表示热烈的欢迎。
    光荣的朝鲜人民，在保卫自己祖国独立、反对美国侵略者的伟大斗争中，经受了严重的战争考验，表现了不屈不挠的英雄气概，并在中国人民和中国人民志愿军及全世界爱好和平人民的援助和支持下，打败了现代最强大的帝国主义的武装侵略，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利。正是由于朝鲜人民这种坚强不屈、不怕牺牲的英勇斗争，由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并肩作战所赢得的胜利，我国人民才能安全地进行大规模的建设。朝鲜人民对于我国的援助和对于亚洲与世界和平事业的贡献是非常重大的。
    朝鲜停战实现之后，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的广泛的国际支援下，朝鲜人民经过短短的五个月时间便完成了恢复经济的准备工作，并于今年一月开始执行恢复和发展经济的三年计划。现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁重工业省领导下的全部工厂以及其他许多重要的企业都已恢复生产，其中煤的产量已增加到战前的两倍；许多重要城市已在进行恢复建设工作；一些新的工厂也已建立起来；人民的生活有了初步的改善。朝鲜北部地区的这种生气勃勃、欣欣向荣的建设气象，与李承晚匪帮统治下的南朝鲜经济濒于崩溃、人民生活陷于绝境的景况，成了鲜明的对比。朝鲜人民恢复国民经济工作的迅速进展，大大地加强了朝鲜的民主基地，增加了朝鲜人民争取在民主的基础上恢复国家统一并巩固朝鲜与亚洲持久和平的正义事业的物质力量。
    我国人民与朝鲜人民不仅在反对共同敌人的斗争中以鲜血结成了牢不可破的友谊，并且在医治朝鲜战争的创伤、恢复朝鲜人民的经济事业中，表现了进一步加强互助合作的精神。去年十一月，由金日成首相率领的朝鲜政府代表团与我国政府在北京举行了友好谈判，缔结了中朝两国经济及文化合作协定，这就是我们两国政府与人民互助合作关系的重大发展的鲜明标志。
    朝中人民互助合作关系的进一步发展与巩固，以及两国人民争取彻底实施朝鲜停战协定、和平解决朝鲜问题的主张与共同决心，得到了以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营及全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持。这就使保卫和平的力量越来越强大，而使力图在朝鲜及远东继续保持国际紧张局势的美国统治集团越来越陷于孤立。美国统治集团和南朝鲜的李承晚集团在朝鲜停战后千方百计地破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施，破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，以武力强迫扣留战俘，并阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开，造成了和平解决朝鲜问题的僵局。但是朝中人民以及各国爱好和平人民都不容许这种情势继续下去，特别是苏联为争取缓和国际紧张局势而进行的坚定努力，使得美国在柏林四国外长会议上不得不同意举行日内瓦会议，以讨论最后解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    但是，不可忽视的事实是：在柏林会议之后，美国统治集团依然力图加强对印度支那战争的干涉，并设法阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。美国宣传机关在散布关于日内瓦会议的悲观论调的同时，正极力宣传“朝鲜将一直按照目前的分界线无限期地分裂下去”。美国在朝鲜的军事当局一面违反朝鲜停战协定的规定，将增援性的武器和飞机非法运入南朝鲜，一面扩充李承晚伪军，使南朝鲜的傀儡军队增加到二十个师的数目。在美国反动势力的支持下一贯叫嚣要破坏朝鲜停战的李承晚，最近又叫嚷着要“向北进军”。这说明美国统治集团在朝鲜，正如在世界其他各处一样，仍然不肯放弃其制造国际紧张局势、准备新战争的政策。
    因此，朝中人民及全世界爱好和平人民当前的重要任务，就是提高警惕，加强团结，揭破美国统治集团的阴谋，以促成日内瓦会议的顺利召开，并为朝鲜问题的最后解决及恢复印度支那的和平而进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    在这个情势之下，我们今天来欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团就更具有特殊的意义。朝鲜人民访华代表团在我国将进行三个月的访问，向我国人民传达朝鲜人民对我国人民的亲切感情，介绍英雄的朝鲜人民为恢复国民经济而进行的建设工作的情况，并参观我国人民的建设成就。朝鲜人民代表与我国人民的会见，将使两国人民的友爱感情和斗争经验得以进一步交流，这无疑会更加增进两国人民的伟大的崇高的战斗友谊。而我们两国人民的友谊越增强一分，就是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量更增长一分。我们相信，朝鲜人民访华团对我国的访问，将获得重大的成功。
