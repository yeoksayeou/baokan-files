Advancing on the Road of Agricultural Cooperation

    Cut off My Roots of Poverty
    A letter from Zhao Zhenqing of Liu Fo Tang Village, Fourth District, Beizhen County, Liaoxi Province (written by Feng Chun): I am a member of the Wu Xiuyan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. After studying the general line, I deeply felt that the saying "the road of cooperation is the road to prosperity for everyone" hit me right in the heart.
    My family used to be very poor. My father died when I was eleven years old. We had no house, no land, nothing to eat or burn. I had to work as a hired hand for others. I worked like an animal for more than ten years, and all I did was avoid starvation. My wife often said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if we had three houses and two *tiandi* [unit of land, 1 *tiandi* = 6 *mu*] of land someday?" I always replied to her with a heavy heart, "Don't dream! We don't have to think about it in this lifetime."
    The Communist Party is here! My family was allocated more than twenty *mu* of good land, and the following year we built three new houses. The children and adults were indescribably happy. Our hopes of decades were realized by the Communist Party!
    In the first two years after liberation, everyone didn't know how to organize. Only I worked in the whole family, and it was really overwhelming during the busy farming season! I couldn't take care of weeding while plowing, and I couldn't take care of plowing while weeding. Before I finished weeding the first time, the second time came. The work squeezed people so much that they didn't have time to breathe. I got up early and worked late all year round, and I only harvested three *shi* [unit of dry measure, approx. 100kg] of grain per *tiandi* in the autumn. There were many people in my family and little grain harvested, so we were still in deficit every year. In 1950, my mother died, and then the donkey died. Our little life couldn't stand such changes! My life fell again, and a debt of seven or eight *shi* of grain weighed on me again.
    In 1952, I joined the Wu Xiuyan Agricultural Production Cooperative. "More people, more power," that's right. The cooperative had more manpower, and it didn't feel difficult to do anything. Last summer it rained continuously, and many individual farmers didn't take care of their land in time; but in our production cooperative, we weeded in the front, and the plow followed behind, so when we finished weeding, we also finished plowing. Therefore, our cooperative achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest last year. The whole cooperative planted thirty-nine *gongqing* [unit of area, 1 *gongqing* = 15 *mu*] of land and harvested more than seven hundred and forty *shi* of grain. After the autumn, I received more than twenty *shi* of grain, which was three or four times more than in previous years. I paid off all the debts I had accumulated over the years and added many new things. I hadn't been able to afford a pair of buckets for many years and used a large basin to carry water; this year I also bought a new pair of buckets. I hadn't been able to afford to change my cotton-padded coat and trousers for four years, and this year I changed into a new khaki cotton-padded coat and trousers, and all the children and adults in the family also changed into new clothes. My two daughters have also gone to school to study.
    Chairman Mao is always concerned about the people living a good life, and now he has put forward the general line, calling on our farmers to take the road to common prosperity (take the socialist road). This road is so right! If we follow this road, everyone can make their lives better day by day. Thanks to my taking the right road, I cut off the roots of poverty in the past; otherwise, how could I live such a comfortable life without worrying about food and clothing like I do now, let alone live the happy life of Soviet farmers in the future!

    We Must Follow the Path of the Cooperative
    A letter from Wang Zhonghe of Xinli Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province (written by Song Lin and Zhang Ce): My home is less than half a mile away from Baoan Village, where the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative is located. The peasants of our two villages were liberated together, but after several years, two different situations have emerged. Under the leadership of Han En, an agricultural labor model, the peasants in Baoan Village listened to the Communist Party, organized themselves for collective production, and every family lived a life of plenty. By 1951, the twenty-three households in Baoan Village had nine rubber-tired carts, eighteen cattle, twenty-four horses, and a set of horse-drawn farm implements. But what about our village? Because everyone's understanding of the road of mutual aid and cooperation was unclear, those with carts and horses spent the whole year outside pulling carts for speculation and profiteering, and those without livestock had to rent livestock at high prices from other villages to cultivate the land. As a result, some poor households sold their houses and land and lived by doing odd jobs; a few wealthy households took the opportunity to buy land and houses.
    At that time, I didn't realize that peasants should take the bright road of socialism. Seeing someone buying land and houses, I was very envious. I scraped together some money and bought a rubber-tired cart and three good horses, and in the winter of 1950, I went outside to pull carts. As a result, after working all winter, the rubber-tired cart turned into a big iron cart, and only two horses were left out of the three. I lost a lot. At this time, the Han En Mutual Aid Group had been reorganized into a cooperative. Comrade Han En also went to our village several times to report on his visit to the Soviet Union. Our whole family went to listen, and we learned that the distribution in Soviet collective farms was based on work, with more pay for more work and less pay for less work. There was no such thing as eating from a communal pot or putting everything in a big pile. In 1952, the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative distributed dividends. I inquired about it, and the distribution was reasonable and satisfactory to both livestock-owning and livestock-free households. The capital invested in carts and horses yielded profits, and the land was given reasonable compensation. The income of the members was more than ours. For example, Xu Fengshan in their cooperative, who only did half the work, had no carts or horses, and still received fourteen *shi* of grain in the autumn of 1952; our family had two horses, one cart, and two and a half laborers, cultivated three *gongqing* of land, and after a year of hard work, only two *shi* of grain were left in the autumn.
    So, we held a family meeting, and everyone discussed joining the cooperative, and my father agreed to try it out. After joining the cooperative, the work was scored and recorded in the cooperative, and the principle of distribution according to work was truly implemented. My wife can do rice paddy work, so she does rice paddy work, and my father is not in good health, so he does light work. Han En led us to carefully study the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience and formulated a high-yield plan. My three *gongqing* of land could not be rotated when I was working alone, and I had to plant more than a dozen kinds of crops every year; last year, the cooperative planted all soybeans according to the soil quality, and because we applied more fertilizer and took care of it in time, it grew better than in previous years. My father happily said, "We joined the cooperative correctly! I have lived for more than fifty years, and this is the first time I have seen such good crops." Although our area suffered frost damage in early September, the cooperative still achieved very good production results last year, with an average yield of 5,600 *jin* [unit of weight, 1 *jin* = 0.5kg] of grain per *gongqing*, which was twice as high as the yield of mutual aid groups in the surrounding villages. Our family received a total of thirty-seven *shi* and four *dou* [unit of dry measure, 1 *dou* = 10 liters] of grain. I have never received so much income before. My father happily said: It is really good to participate in the cooperative, we must continue to work along the road of the cooperative.

    My Calculation Was Wrong
    A letter from Hu Changrong of Kongjiawan Village, Henan Township, Xinji District, Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province (written by Gu Xinhao): I live in Kongjiawan Village, Henan Township, Xinji District. My family has nine people and forty-one and seven-tenths *mu* of land. A piece of land in front of my door has very good soil, but it is close to the Chu River and the terrain is low, so it is often flooded. In the winter of 1951, I joined the mutual aid group. The group members worked together to prevent floods and droughts, and cultivated carefully, which greatly increased the yield of this piece of land. In 1952, each *mu* of rice yielded 331 *jin*, and each *mu* of wheat yielded more than 180 *jin*. In the spring of 1953, the mutual aid group added a high and wide water barrier to the 347 *mu* of low-lying land near the Chu River. In this way, the crops planted were fully guaranteed not to be flooded or droughted. At that time, I secretly calculated: my family has five laborers, who can barely cultivate the land on weekdays. When busy, the number of hired workers is very limited, and relatives can also be invited to help. Why bother every day in the mutual aid group? Besides, production has increased in recent years, and life has been good, and livestock and farm tools are readily available. It can be said that everything is self-sufficient. When harvesting wheat, I formally asked the group leader Wang Yirong to work alone. Although the comrades in the group repeatedly persuaded and educated me, I resolutely withdrew from the group.
    After withdrawing from the mutual aid group, my family rushed to harvest wheat. After working hard for more than half a month, seeing that every household in the mutual aid group had dried and stored their wheat, I was still busy threshing. When transplanting rice seedlings, it was unfortunate that it didn't rain, and the water in the weirs and ponds also dried up. Because I didn't have enough people, I couldn't take care of transplanting rice seedlings while carting water. Every day, the whole family went to the ground at daybreak and worked until dark, and only transplanted more than four *mu* of rice seedlings in a week. Seeing that the members of the mutual aid group, thirty or forty people, used eight or nine waterwheels every day, pumping water from the Chu River day and night to transplant rice seedlings, and every household was about to finish transplanting, the early transplanted seedlings had already turned green. I was anxious to find relatives to help, but they had also joined the mutual aid group and could not come. In the end, the mutual aid group helped me in their spare time, and I didn't finish transplanting until early May. In mid-July, there was a drought, and I ran around to find short-term workers; the mutual aid group also helped me save the rice seedlings once. In the autumn harvest, every group member had a bumper harvest, with an average of 459 *jin* per *mu* in the whole group; while my twenty-four *mu* of land only averaged 155 *jin* per *mu*.
    After this lesson, I was really regretful. When studying the general line, the mutual aid group members sold their surplus grain to the state, and the forty-three households in the whole group sold 58,700 *jin* of grain (including cash crops). Kong Xinlu in the village used to have no lunch after breakfast. After joining the mutual aid group, he had enough to eat and wear, and this time he was able to sell more than 1,000 *jin* of surplus grain. After studying, I began to realize that the thought of getting rich personally blinded my eyes, and I could not see that the small-scale peasant economy could not withstand three winds and four rains; I deeply understood the truth that "only mutual aid and cooperation can overcome natural disasters and produce more grain."
    Last winter, I rejoined the mutual aid group. To my delight, all the group members still welcomed me to join. In the future, no matter what, I don't want to withdraw from the group again. I want to work hard with everyone to strive to transform our mutual aid group into an agricultural production cooperative as soon as possible.

    I Deeply Experienced the Hardships of Working Alone
    A letter from Cao Wanqun, Yeyu Township, District One, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province (written by Yao Tiancang, Wang Aihuan, and Shen Hongzhong): When our village established an agricultural cooperative last winter, I signed up to join. Because I did not have a clear understanding of the direction of rural development at that time, I always felt that a strong laborer like me could easily cultivate my nine and a half *mu* of land. I would be busy for half a year and idle for half a year. I was afraid of being "restricted" in the cooperative, and I was afraid that I would not be able to produce more grain. Therefore, I resolutely demanded to withdraw from the cooperative in April last year.
    After withdrawing from the cooperative, I secretly competed with the cooperative in my work. But the facts of the past year have been revealed one by one, and I have always lagged behind the cooperative in production. The basal fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer per *mu* of land in the cooperative are more than double mine. The cooperative sows and thins seedlings more timely than me. Especially when weeding seedlings, the cooperative weeded three times on schedule according to the plan. After weeding, it rained thoroughly, and the crops grew black and lush in a few days. I hurried to weed only twice, and one *mu* of millet was wasted because it was not weeded before the rain. In addition, the cooperative pays attention to technology and carried out warm water seed soaking before sowing. The crops grew particularly well from the emergence of seedlings to harvesting. The masses said, "Good crops are definitely from the agricultural cooperative." At the time of the autumn harvest, there were many people in the cooperative, and they shelled corn and harvested grain at the same time. Everything was harvested with a bang. I couldn't take care of this end and couldn't take care of that end alone. The grain hadn't been harvested before the wind started, and some seeds were blown away. Besides, the cooperative organized labor and livestock well, and assigned tasks according to their specialties, drawing nine surplus laborers to engage in sideline occupations, with a sideline income of more than 8 million yuan a year. I didn't cultivate the land well, let alone engage in sideline occupations. The cooperative averaged 396 *jin* of grain per *mu* last year, while I only produced 221 *jin*, which was less than 60% of the cooperative's output.
    At this time, my wife complained: "Look at you, you've been working to death all year round, and you can't catch up with the cooperative in anything. If you hadn't withdrawn from the cooperative, you would have harvested more than this. If the cooperative wants us next year, let's join! If we don't join again, I'm afraid we'll starve our children to death in two years!" At that time, I was ashamed and angry, and didn't answer. I thought to myself: "You don't need to say that, I have regretted it for a long time. But like a mute person eating bitter melon, how can I open my mouth and tell others?" It was really a coincidence that the village soon began to publicize the state's general line in the transition period and carry out the work of purchasing grain. After listening to the speech of the work team comrades and studying the general line, I knew that the peasants should sell their surplus grain to the state to support the state's industrial construction and realize the state's socialist industrialization; at the same time, we should develop agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups in large numbers, organize the peasants, and move towards socialism step by step through the mutual aid and cooperation movement. So, I sold 300 *jin* of surplus grain to the state and was the first to volunteer to join the agricultural cooperative. I said: "In the past year, I have deeply experienced the hardships of working alone. This time I have studied the general line again, and I recall that I took the wrong path before. In the future, I will resolutely participate in the agricultural cooperative and take the socialist road."

    在农业合作化的道路上前进
    切断了我的穷根子
    辽西省北镇县四区刘佛堂村赵振卿来信（凤春代笔）：我是吴秀岩农业生产合作社的社员。学习总路线后，我深深感到“合作化的道路是大家富裕的路”这句话正说到我心眼里去了。
    我过去家里很穷，十一岁那年父亲就死了，家里房无一间，地无一垅，没吃没烧，我只得给人家扛小活去。像牛马一样干了十多年，除了没饿死以外，啥也没挣下。我妻子常和我说：“咱们自己早晚有三间房子、两天地（一天地是六亩），那可就好了。”我总是割心似地回答她：“别做梦吧！咱们这辈子不用惦着啦。”
    共产党来啦！我家分了二十多亩好地，第二年又盖了三间新房。孩子大人都有说不出来的高兴，我们几十年的希望，共产党来了实现啦！
    刚解放那两年，大伙还不知道组织起来的办法。全家就我一个人干活，到农忙时真是干不过来呀！顾铲顾不了?，顾?顾不了铲；还没铲完头遍，二遍又该铲啦。活计把人压的都没有喘气工夫。起早贪晚忙一年，下秋一天地只打三石粮。人口多，打粮少，还是年年有些亏空。一九五○年我母亲病故了，紧接着驴又死了。小日子那架得起这样的变故呀！我的日子又摔下去了，七、八石粮的债又压到我的身上。
    一九五二年我参加了吴秀岩农业生产合作社。“人多力量大”，这句话很对，合作社人手多，干啥活也不感觉费劲。去年夏天雨水连绵，好多单干户的地侍弄的不及时；可是我们生产合作社呢，头前铲着，后边犁杖就跟着?，这样铲完了，也就?完了。所以去年我们社秋后得到全面丰产。全社种三十九垧地，打七百四十多石粮食。秋后我分得了二十多石粮食，超过往年三、四倍。我几年来拉的债都还清了，还增添了好多新东西。过去好几年没买起一付水桶，担水时使大盆；今年也买了一付新水桶。过去我四年没换起棉袄棉裤，今年我换上了新卡其的棉袄棉裤，全家孩子大人也都换上了新衣。我两个姑娘还都上学念书了。
    毛主席时刻关心老百姓过好日子，现在又提出总路线，叫咱农民走大家富裕的道（走社会主义道路）。这条道提的太对啦！咱们按着这条道走，大伙都能把日子过得一天比一天强。多亏我走对了路，才切断了过去的穷根子；要不，那里过得上像现在这样不愁吃、不愁穿的舒心日子，更不用说将来要过苏联农民那样的幸福生活了！
    咱要顺着合作社这条道干
    吉林省蛟河县新立屯王忠和来信（松林、张策代笔）：我家离韩恩农业生产合作社所在的保安屯不到半里地。咱们这两个屯子的农民都是一块翻身的，但经过了几年却出现了两种不同情况。保安屯的农民在农业劳动模范韩恩的领导下，听了共产党的话，组织起来集体生产，家家都过着丰衣足食的生活。到一九五一年，保安屯的二十三户就有了九台胶皮车、十八头牛、二十四匹马和一套马拉农具。可是我们屯子呢？由于大家对互助合作的道路认识不清，有车有马的整年在外边拉脚搞投机买卖，没有牲口的只好到外屯高价租牲口种地。结果有些贫困户卖房子卖地，靠做零工过活；个别富裕户就乘机买土地和房屋。
    那时，我还不认识农民应该走社会主义的光明大道，看见有人买地买房，心里羡慕得很，凑了些钱也买了一台胶皮车和三匹好马，在一九五○年冬天到外边拉脚。结果干了一冬，胶皮车赔成了大铁车，三匹马只剩下两匹，赔个够呛。这时韩恩互助组已改组成了合作社。韩恩同志又接连几次到我们屯里报告了访苏见闻。我们全家都去听了，知道苏联的集体农庄分配是按劳取酬，多干活就分得多，少干活就分得少，根本没有吃大锅饭、归大堆的事。一九五二年韩恩农业生产合作社分红了。我打听了一下，人家分得又入情又合理，有牲口户和无牲口户都满意，入股的车马资金都有利，土地也给了合理报酬。社员们的收入都比我们多。像他们社内的徐凤山干活只顶个半拉子，车马都没有，一九五二年秋天还分了十四石粮食；我们家有两匹马、一台车、两个半劳动力，种了三垧地，忙了一年，到秋只剩下两石粮。
    于是，我们开了一个家庭会，大家讨论要参加合作社父亲也同意试试看。入社以后，社内评分记工，真正贯彻了按劳取酬原则。我妻子能干水田活就做水田活，我父亲身体不好就干轻巧活。韩恩领导我们大伙仔细学习了肇源丰产经验，并制定了丰产计划。我那三垧地单干时调不开茬口，每年都要种十几种庄稼；去年合作社就按照土质全种了大豆，更由于上粪多、侍弄应时，比往年长得都好。我父亲乐得说：“咱入社算对啦！我活五十多岁了，头一回看到这样的好庄稼。”虽然九月初旬我们这一带庄稼受了冻害，但是去年全社生产成绩还很好，平均每垧地产了五千六百斤粮食，比我们周围屯的互助组的产量高一倍。我们全家总共分了三十七石四斗粮。过去从来没有收入这么多。我父亲高兴地说：参加合作社可真好，咱要顺着合作社这条道干下去。
    我的算盘打错了
    江苏省六合县胡长荣来信（顾新豪代笔）：我住在新集区河南乡孔家湾庄，家里有九个人，四十一亩七分田。我门口的一片地，土质很好，只是靠近滁河、地势又低，经常遭淹。一九五一年冬天，我参加了互助组，组员们同心合力，防涝抗旱，精耕细作，这块地的产量大大提高，一九五二年每亩稻子收到三百三十一斤，麦子收到一百八十多斤。一九五三年春天，互助组又把靠近滁河的三百四十七亩洼田加上了一道又高又宽的挡水堤。这样，种下去的庄稼完全有把握不遭淹不受旱了。那时，我暗暗盘算：我自家有五个劳动力，平日马马虎虎可以耕种，忙时请几个工也有限得很，亲戚也可以请来帮忙，何必在互助组里天天烦神呢？再说这几年生产提高了，光景已经过得不错，牲口农具样样俱全，可以说得上万事不求人了。在割麦的时候，我就正式向组长王义荣提出要求单干。虽然组里的同志一再向我进行说服和教育，但是我还是坚决退组了。
    退出互助组后，我一家人就赶着收割麦子。辛辛苦苦忙了半个多月，眼看互助组里家家晒好藏好，但我还在忙着打场哩。在栽秧的时候，不巧天不下雨，圩沟塘内的水也干了。我因为人不够，顾了车水就顾不到栽秧，一家大小每天鸡叫下地忙到天黑，一个星期只栽了四亩多田秧；看看互助组组员们三、四十个人，每天八、九部水车，日夜轮流在滁河上打水栽秧，一家一家都要栽完了，早栽的秧已经转青。我急着找亲戚帮忙，谁知他们也参加了互助组，不能来。最后还是互助组抽空帮助我，至五月初才栽完。七月中旬碰到天旱，我东奔西跑请不到短工；也是互助组帮助救了一遍秧水。秋收了，组员家家丰收，全组每亩平均收到四百五十九斤；而我二十四亩田每亩平均只有一百五十五斤。
    经过这个教训，我心中真是懊悔。学习总路线时，互助组组员纷纷将余粮卖给国家，全组四十三户就卖了五万八千七百斤粮食（包括经济作物在内）。庄上孔新录过去吃了早饭就吃不到中饭，参加互助组后够吃够穿，这次还能出卖了一千多斤余粮。经过学习，我开始认识是个人想发财思想把自己的眼睛蒙住了，看不清小农经济是经不起三风四雨的；深深领会了“只有互助合作才能战胜自然灾害多打粮食”的道理。
    去年冬天，我又重新参加了互助组。使我高兴的是，全体组员依旧欢迎我参加。今后，怎么说我也不愿再退组了，我要和大家一起，共同努力，争取把我们的互助组早日转为农业生产合作社。
    我深深体验到单干的苦处
    山西省平顺县一区野峪乡曹万群（姚天仓、王爱环、申宏忠代笔）来信：前年冬天我村成立农业社时，我报名参加了。因为我当时没有明确认识农村发展方向，总感到像我这样强的劳力，种自己这九亩半地还不是脚踢手拨拉，半年辛苦半年闲；在社里“受拘束”，怕也多打不了粮食。所以，去年四月我就坚决要求出社。
    出社后，我干活暗地在和社里竞赛。可是一年来的事实一件一件摆出来了，我在生产上总是落在社的后面。社内每亩地上的底肥和追肥都要比我多
  一倍。社里下种、间苗都比我适时。尤其是锄苗时，社内按计划适时地锄了三遍，锄完正好下了场透雨，不几天庄稼黑乌乌的长起来了；我一个人紧赶慢赶只锄了两遍，有一亩谷子因下雨前没锄下还荒了。加上社内讲究技术，下种前进行了温汤浸种，庄稼从小苗出土到收割长的都特别好，群众都说：“好庄稼不用问都是农业社的。”秋收时社内人多，又撇玉茭又割谷，哗啦哗啦就都收回来了；我一个人顾了这头顾不了那头，谷子还没割完就起了风，又刮掉些籽。再说社内劳畜力组织的好，又按特长分工，把九个剩余劳力抽出来搞副业，一年副业收入八百多万元；我是地没种好，更别说搞副业了。社里去年平均每亩地产粮食三百九十六斤，我只产二百二十一斤，还赶不上合作社产量的六成。
    这时我老婆埋怨说：“瞧你一年赶死啦，做啥也赶不上社。要是不出社，总比这要打得多。下年社要咱的话，可参加吧！再不参加，照这样闹上二年，还怕不饿死咱孩子们呢！”当时我又羞又气，没有回答，心里想：“这还用你说，我早就后悔得不行。但是哑子吃苦瓜，叫我怎样去开口和人家说呢？”真巧，不久村里开始宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和进行收购粮食的工作。我听了工作组同志讲话，学习了总路线，知道农民要把余粮卖给国家，支持国家工业建设，实现国家的社会主义工业化；同时要大量发展农业社、互助组，把农民组织起来，通过互助合作运动一步一步地走向社会主义。于是，我把三百斤余粮卖给了国家，并第一个自报坚决参加农业社。我说：“一年来我深深体验到单干的苦处，这次我又学习了总路线，回想我以前真走错了路。今后我坚决参加农业社，走社会主义道路。”
