    Northeast Military Region Holds Literary and Artistic Review

    The Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held its Second Literary and Artistic Review Conference from March 1st to 16th. Participating in this review were sixteen literary and artistic delegations, totaling more than 1,400 people, from various branches of the armed forces and units under the Northeast Military Region, both professional and amateur.

    This review conference demonstrated the significant progress made in both the popularization and improvement of literary and artistic activities within the military over the past two years. The vast majority of participants were amateur performance teams composed of soldiers. The performances featured short, diverse formats and rich content, reflecting the combat, work, study, and life of the troops, and portraying the heroic image of the people's soldiers. The soldiers' high degree of creativity was also evident in the performances. For example, "Hero Zhu Wanfu" adopted an innovative form of collective recitation. This was performed by the soldiers of the platoon where Deputy Platoon Leader Zhu Wanfu served before his death, expressing the soldiers' remembrance and respect for the hero. The drum ballad "Protecting the Factory and Rescuing from Fire" demonstrated the high sense of responsibility and patriotism of the public security forces in safeguarding the country's economic construction. Singing "Ode to Dengta Mountain," Shandong quick narrative "Fighting at Sea," and other performances fully expressed the lofty qualities of the People's Liberation Army in bravely defending the country and struggling arduously. Many programs also learned and applied national and folk art forms.

    As a result of the review, the amateur literary and artistic delegation's recitation "Hero Zhu Wanfu" and the chorus "Marching Towards a Great Cultural Advance" won first prizes for performance. The professional literary and artistic delegation's "Soldiers' Rest Dance" won an award for outstanding performance. A total of 121 programs from amateur and professional literary and artistic delegations won second and third prizes for performance and composition, and 67 individuals won awards for individual performance.

    东北军区举行文艺检阅大会
    中国人民解放军东北军区从三月一日起到十六日止，举行了全军区第二届文艺检阅大会。参加这次检阅的有东北军区所属各兵种、各部队专业和业余的十六个文艺代表队，共一千四百多人。
    这次检阅大会显示，近两年来部队文艺活动在普及和提高方面都有了很大进步。参加检阅大会的绝大部分是战士组成的业余演出队，会演的节目都以短小、多样的形式和丰富的内容，反映了部队战斗、工作、学习和生活的面貌，表现了人民战士的英雄形象。从表演中也看出了战士们的高度创造性。如“英雄朱万富”采用了集体朗诵的首创形式。这是某部副排长朱万富生前所在排的战士们演出的，表现了战士对英雄的怀念和崇敬的心情。大鼓“护厂救火”，表现了公安部队战士保卫祖国经济建设的高度责任心和爱国主义精神。演唱“歌唱灯塔山”、山东快书“海上搏斗”等，都充分表现了人民解放军英勇卫国、艰苦奋斗的崇高品质。许多节目还学习和运用了民族和民间艺术形式。
    检阅结果，业余文艺代表队的朗诵“英雄朱万富”和合唱“向文化大进军”等获得演出一等奖。专业文艺代表队的“士兵休息舞”获得优秀表演奖。业余和专业的文艺代表队共有一百二十一个节目获得二等、三等演出奖和作品奖，有六十七人获得个人表演奖。　（新华社）
