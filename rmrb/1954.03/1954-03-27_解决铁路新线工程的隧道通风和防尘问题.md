    Resolving Tunnel Ventilation and Dust Prevention Issues in New Railway Line Projects

    Letter from the New Railway Construction Engineering Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways: The suggestion in the "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on January 12, "Attaching Importance to the Safety and Health of Tunnel Workers," is very good. The ventilation problem in Tunnel No. 20 of the Fourth Engineering Bureau was indeed a serious issue in the past. Later, after a major safety production inspection, the leadership also took some concrete measures, and the situation has improved. However, as mentioned in the suggestion, as tunnel excavation goes deeper, the existing ventilation equipment will be insufficient. In order to fundamentally solve the ventilation problem in long tunnels, our bureau has ordered dozens of 150 mm high-pressure blowers, and will soon allocate ten units to the Fourth Engineering Bureau; it has also been pointed out that when using general ventilators in long tunnels, another unit should be installed inside the tunnel to take over the air supply from the ventilator outside the tunnel. The Fourth Engineering Bureau also attaches great importance to this issue, and recently organized a special working group to first go to the Chengzi Coal Mine in Jingxi to learn about ventilation and dust prevention methods in coal mines, and then promote them upon their return. In addition, in order to improve the working conditions of tunnel workers, we have also stipulated that: in the future, mechanical drilling in tunnels should use wet rock drills as much as possible to eliminate stone dust; use rock drills with supports instead of manually carried rock drills to prevent workers' bodies from being severely vibrated, thereby affecting their health; and continue to educate workers to use protective equipment such as masks, goggles, and work clothes in accordance with regulations.

    According to our understanding, currently not only the Fourth Engineering Bureau's tunnels have ventilation and dust prevention problems, but also other bureaus and companies under the New Railway Construction Engineering Bureau also have this problem. Therefore, we wrote a letter to each bureau and company on January 30, asking them to strengthen inspections, and we plan to form a working group with relevant departments to learn advanced experiences from factories and mines across the country with successful ventilation and dust prevention work, in order to completely solve the tunnel ventilation and dust prevention problems in new railway line projects.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    解决铁路新线工程的隧道通风和防尘问题
    中央铁道部新建铁路工程总局来信：一月十二日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊“重视隧道工人的安全和健康”的建议很好。第四工程局第二十号隧道的通风问题在以前确实是个严重问题，后来经过安全生产大检查，领导方面也采取了一些具体措施，情况已经好转。但是正如建议中提到的，今后隧道的掘进日深，现有的通风设备就会不敷需要。为了从根本上解决长隧道的通风问题，我局已订购了数十部一百五十公厘的高压送风机，即将分配给第四工程局十台；并指出在长隧道使用一般通风机时，应在洞内另行安装一台，与洞外的通风机接替送风。第四工程局也很重视这个问题，最近并组织了一个专门工作组，拟先至京西城子煤矿学习煤矿内通风、防尘的防护办法，回来后再行推广。此外，为了改善隧道工人的劳动条件，我们还规定：今后隧道内机械打眼应尽量采用湿式风钻，以消灭石粉；采用有支架的风钻代替用人力扛抬的风钻，免使工人身体受到剧烈震动，因而影响健康；继续教育工人按照规定使用口罩、护目镜、工作服等防护用品。
    据我们了解，目前不仅第四工程局隧道内通风、防尘有问题，新建铁路工程总局所属其他各局、各公司也同样存在这个问题。因此，我们已于一月三十日写信请各局、各公司加强检查，并拟与有关部门组成工作组到全国通风、防尘工作有成绩的厂矿学习先进经验，以彻底解决铁路新线工程的隧道通风和防尘问题。
