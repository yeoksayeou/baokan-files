    Enterprises Affiliated to the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Exceed February's Main Product Plan

    [Our newspaper] The enterprises affiliated to the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry exceeded February's main product plan. The completion rate of the plan for five major products under the bureau is as follows: iron ore 119.5, metallurgical coke 101.9, pig iron 102.8, steel 105.4 (open-hearth steel 103.6, electric furnace steel 110.4, converter steel 104.5), steel products 112.9. The enterprises under the bureau that comprehensively completed the main product plan in February accounted for 91.7% of the total number of enterprises producing main products (53.2% in February last year). Larger-scale enterprises such as Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and Factory 101 have all comprehensively completed the main product plan.

    In February, the bureau focused on production organization, continuously urged enterprises to prepare for production, and promptly checked the implementation of plans. As a result, the specialized production of each enterprise made new progress. In terms of iron smelting, the overhaul of each blast furnace was greatly shortened compared to the planned time, with a total reduction of 22.9%. Because each blast furnace generally paid attention to improving the furnace top distribution and furnace mouth maintenance, the furnace conditions tended to be stable. For example, Longyan Iron Mine implemented expert suggestions, installed a straight-barrel funnel on the top of the blast furnace, improved the distribution, and installed a flow meter to operate according to the air volume, which improved blast furnace production. The average daily output in February increased by 5.3% compared to January. In terms of steelmaking, the unplanned and over-planned overhaul time of open-hearth furnaces in each enterprise was shortened by 40% compared to January, and the smelting time was also shortened. For example, the open-hearth furnace in Factory 104 promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, spraying tar into the gas regenerator to improve thermal efficiency, which shortened the average smelting time per furnace by 5.4% compared to January. In terms of steel rolling, a variety of new products were successfully trial-produced in February, which is of great significance for supporting construction in various regions.

    In February, a few enterprises experienced a phenomenon of being loose in the beginning and tight at the end. Some units did not strictly implement the planned maintenance system and did not pay attention to technical operations, which affected product quality and needs to be corrected.

    In order to complete and overfulfill the production plan for the first quarter, the enterprises under the bureau are strengthening planning and scheduling work, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair work, actively promoting advanced experience, and conscientiously implementing expert suggestions, with the establishment of a production area management system as the center. They are also paying attention to signing second-quarter order contracts to prepare for second-quarter production.

    中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业
    超额完成二月份主要产品计划
    【本报讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业超额完成了二月份主要产品计划。该局所属企业五种主要产品完成计划情况为：铁矿石一一九点五，冶金焦一○一点九，生铁一○二点八，钢一○五点四（平炉钢一○三点六，电炉钢一一○点四，转炉钢一○四点五），钢材一一二点九。该局二月份全面完成主要产品计划的企业，占生产主要产品企业总数的百分之九一点七（去年二月份为百分之五三点二），规模较大的企业如本溪钢铁公司、太原钢铁厂、石景山钢铁厂和一○一厂等单位，都全面地完成了主要产品计划。
    该局在二月份抓紧了生产组织工作，不断督促各企业做好生产准备工作，及时检查计划执行情况，因而各企业的专业生产都有了新的进步。在炼铁方面，各高炉检修均较计划时间大为缩短，共缩短百分之二二点九。由于各高炉普遍注意改进了炉顶布料与炉口维护工作，炉况均趋稳定，如龙烟铁矿贯彻专家建议，在高炉炉顶安装了直桶漏斗，改进了布料，又安装了风量计，执行按风量操作，使高炉生产提高，二月份平均日产量比一月份提高了百分之五点三；在炼钢方面，各企业平炉的非计划和超计划检修时间较一月份缩短了百分之四十，熔炼时间也有缩短，如一○四厂平炉推广了苏联先进经验，在煤气蓄热室中喷加焦油，提高热效率，使每炉平均熔炼时间较一月份缩短了百分之五点四；轧钢方面，在二月份试制成功了多种新的产品，对支援各地建设有重大意义。
    在二月份还有少数企业发生了前松后紧的现象，有些单位不严格执行计划检修制度，不注意技术操作，因而影响了产品质量，需要注意纠正。
    为完成和超额完成第一季度生产计划，该局各企业正以建立生产区域管理制为中心，加强计划和调度工作，加强设备维护检修工作，积极推广先进经验，认真贯彻专家建议；并注意签订第二季订货合同，为第二季生产进行准备工作。
