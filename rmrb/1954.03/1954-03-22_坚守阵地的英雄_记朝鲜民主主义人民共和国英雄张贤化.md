　　Hero Who Held the Ground
    ——Remembering Zhang Xianhua, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    This was just one of the many outstanding battles Zhang Xianhua participated in.
    At the end of August 1951, the 923.8 Height of Yue Mountain, guarded by the People's Army, stood like a sharp blade piercing the enemy's heart in a certain area of the Korean front.
    The enemy concentrated more than forty artillery pieces, twenty-four aircraft, and more than six hundred "ace troops" to "assault" this height. When the enemy attacked, from a distance, the height looked like a burning sea of ​​fire. The fierce battle had been going on for a day and a night, and the enemy had launched a total of eight attacks, but each time they suffered heavy casualties and were defeated.
    So how many People's Army soldiers were guarding this height? There were only seven in total, that is, squad leader Zhang Xianhua and the six soldiers under his command. Despite the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, Zhang Xianhua did not think it was important. At the beginning of the battle, after checking the position, he said to his soldiers: "We have two machine guns, we have boxes and boxes of grenades, what is there to be afraid of! Comrades, don't panic, stick to it, and victory will be ours."
    The fierce battle had entered its second day. As usual, the enemy came pouring towards the height like stupid pigs after a barrage of artillery fire. Closer, closer, the enemy was only thirty meters away from the forward edge of the height, twenty meters, fifteen meters. The enemy was probably dreaming of climbing the height, when suddenly machine gun fire and grenades, one after another, spewed out from the trenches. The enemy retreated. At this critical moment, machine gunner Park Tae-joon, who was squatting next to Zhang Xianhua, fell with a serious head injury. Just as Zhang Xianhua was about to rush to rescue his comrade, the enemy heard a machine gun stop firing and pounced again. Zhang Xianhua immediately turned around, grabbed the machine gun trigger, and began firing. Bullets poured towards the enemy like a storm. The enemy fell again, and those who could retreated.
    On the second day of the battle, the enemy launched six more counterattacks in succession. Although the position remained unmoved, the situation became more and more serious. Some comrades had been sacrificed, others wounded, and now only Zhang Xianhua and two soldiers remained. Not to mention that they could not drink a mouthful of water or eat a mouthful of food, the more serious thing was that only seven bullets remained, and the heavy machine gun could not fire due to overheating. But in such day and night battles, in the smoke and fire and deafening artillery fire, and in the critical situation they were now in, what Zhang Xianhua thought of was not death, not failure, but life, victory, and the happiness of mankind. He remembered the words the battalion commander had said to him personally when he handed over this combat mission: "Comrade, do you know what position we are defending? We are defending a position of the world's peace camp. For such a position, we can only defend it, we cannot lose it..." He thought of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea, eating a mouthful of fried noodles and a mouthful of snow, fighting hard in the frozen world, "What are they fighting for!" He also thought of the many heroic brothers who had emerged in various battles, and then he thought of the land of his motherland behind him, the green hills, the slopes full of green trees, the winding rivers, the smoking factory chimneys, and the endless rice fields. How beautiful the motherland is! It cannot be allowed to be occupied by the enemy in the slightest!
    At the same time, he also used this spirit to encourage the other two comrades to calmly and firmly defend the position and strike the enemy.
    Just then, the enemy struggled to climb up again.
    Zhang Xianhua calmly said to his comrades: "Comrades, we must use these few grenades to eliminate this batch of enemies; when we have thrown all the grenades, we must seize the enemy's weapons to eliminate the enemy!"
    When the enemy climbed to within twenty meters of the position, Zhang Xianhua and his two comrades threw many grenades at the enemy. There was only a series of earth-shattering explosions, and the enemy fell in a chaotic mess. Afterwards, the enemy organized another counterattack, but it was similarly repelled. Until reinforcements arrived, the position they defended still stood unmoved.
    In this battle, a total of two hundred and forty enemies were killed, and Zhang Xianhua alone killed one hundred and fifty.
    Since then, Zhang Xianhua has worn a glittering Gold Star Medal and a First Class National Flag Medal on his chest. The title of Hero of the Republic was also added to his name.
    Now, he has come to China with the great honor gained from arduous battles to participate in the Korean People's Delegation to China. (Attached picture)

　　坚守阵地的英雄
    ——记朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄张贤化
    这只是张贤化参加的许多次出色战斗中的一次。
    一九五一年八月的末尾，人民军守卫的月山九二三·八高地就象刺向敌人心脏的一把利刃一样，屹立在朝鲜前线的某地。
    敌人集中了四十多门大炮，二十四架飞机，还有六百多“王牌军”向这个高地“突击”。当敌人进攻的时候，远远望去，高地就象燃烧着的火海，激烈的战斗已经进行了一天一夜，敌人前后总共组织了八次进攻，可是，每次都是死伤累累，败下山来。
    那么守卫在这个高地上的人民军有多少呢？一共只有七个，这就是小队长张贤化和他带领下的六个战士。尽管敌我的力量是这样悬殊，但是在张贤化看来这并不重要。战斗一开始，他检查了一遍阵地以后，对他的战士说：“我们有两挺机枪，我们有成箱成箱的手榴弹，还有什么可怕呢！同志们，千万不要慌，坚持下去，就是胜利。”
    激烈的战斗已经进入第二天了。敌人照例是一阵排炮以后，象蠢猪似的向高地上涌来。近了，近了，敌人离开高地的前沿只有三十公尺了，二十公尺了，十五公尺了。敌人大概正在作着爬上高地的梦想，突然从战壕里迎面喷出了机枪的火舌还有一个接着一个的手榴弹。敌人退了。正在这个紧要关头，蹲在张贤化身边的机枪手朴泰俊头部重伤跌倒了。张贤化正要急救自己的战友时，敌人听到一挺机枪停止了响声，翻身又扑上来，张贤化马上回头抓住机枪的扳机射击起来，枪弹象狂风骤雨似的扑向敌人。敌人又倒的倒了，退的退了。
    在这战斗的第二天，敌人又连续反扑了六次。阵地虽然丝毫未动，但情况越来越严重。战友们牺牲的牺牲，受伤的受伤，现在只剩下张贤化和两个战士了。不说他们喝不到一口水，吃不到一口饭，更严重的是子弹只剩下七发，重机枪也因为热度过高而不能射击了。但是在这样日日夜夜的战斗中，在硝烟烈火和震耳的炮声中，在他们现在处的这种危急情况中，张贤化想到的不是死，不是失败，他想的是生，是胜利，是人类的幸福。他想起大队长亲自把这次战斗任务交给他时讲的那几句话：“同志，你知道咱们守的是什么阵地？咱们守的是全世界和平营垒的一个阵地。对这样的阵地，我们只能守，不能丢……”他想起来朝鲜作战的中国人民志愿军，他们一口炒面，一口雪，在冰天雪地里艰苦地打仗，“他们为的是什么呀！”他又想到在各次战役中涌现的许许多多的英雄弟兄，他随着又想起了他身背后的祖国的土地，那青青的山岭，那满坡的绿树，那弯弯曲曲的河流，那冒烟的工厂的烟囱，那一望无际的水田，祖国多么美丽呀！不能让敌人侵占她分毫！
    同时，他也用这种精神鼓舞着另外两个战友沉着坚定地守卫阵地，打击敌人。
    就在这时，敌人又挣扎着爬上来了。
    张贤化镇定地对战友说：“同志们，我们要用仅有的这些颗手榴弹来消灭这批敌人；在打完手榴弹的时候，我们要抢夺敌人的武器来消灭敌人！”
    当敌人爬到离阵地只剩二十公尺时，张贤化和他的两个战友把许多手榴弹扔向敌群，只听得一阵惊天动地的连续爆炸，敌人横七竖八地倒下一片，以后敌人又组织了反扑，但同样被击退了。直到援军开到，他们守卫的阵地还屹立未动。
    这一次战斗，一共打死了二百四十个敌人，张贤化一个人就杀死了一百五十个。
    从此，张贤化的胸前，就挂上了一个金光闪闪的金星勋章、一个一级国旗勋章。在他的名字上面也加上了共和国英雄的称号。
    现在，他又带着用艰苦战斗换来的巨大荣誉，参加朝鲜人民访华代表团来中国访问了。（附图片）
