    Datong Mining Bureau Carries Out Second Quarter Production Preparation Work
    The workers of the Datong Mining Bureau are now undertaking production preparation work for the second quarter.
    The Datong Mining Bureau's completion of its production plan for the first quarter of this year is good. The average actual daily output in January increased by 7.72% compared to the average daily production level in the fourth quarter of last year. The average daily output in February increased by 4.4% compared to January, and the average daily output in the first half of March increased by 3.03% compared to February. The planned daily output for the second quarter is 2.29% higher than the actual daily output level in the first quarter.
    Experience in the first quarter has proven that doing a good job in production preparation is the key to ensuring the balanced and safe overfulfillment of production tasks. Therefore, leading cadres of the Datong Mining Bureau, while ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production plan, promptly discussed and compiled the second quarter's and monthly production plans and examined the problems in production. The larger problems in the second quarter are at Mine No. 1 and Mine No. 4. No. 2 well of Mine No. 1 will be officially opened for coal extraction in the second quarter, but it is short more than 200 workers, and equipment orders have not arrived on time. Preparations are now actively underway, with workers being recruited with the assistance of the local government, the labor organization is being adjusted, and people are being sent to the Northeast, Zhangjiakou and other places to transport mechanical equipment. Mine No. 4 has many electromechanical accidents, and the central problem is a shortage of spare parts. The electromechanical department is now making great efforts to solve this problem to ensure that Mine No. 4 has enough spare parts for the second quarter.
    In the second quarter, the mining bureau will organize inter-work-type and inter-business competitions to ensure the comprehensive, balanced, and safe completion of the production plan.

    大同矿务局进行第二季度生产准备工作
    大同矿务局职工，正着手进行第二季度的生产准备工作。
    大同矿务局今年第一季度完成生产计划的情况是良好的。一月份的平均实际日产量比去年第四季度平均每日生产水平提高了百分之七点七二，二月份平均日产量又比一月份提高了百分之四点四，三月份前半月的平均日产量又比二月份提高了百分之三点零三。而第二季度的计划日产量又比第一季度实际日产水平提高了百分之二点二九。
    第一季度的经验证明，做好生产准备工作，是保证均衡地、安全地超额完成生产任务的关键。因此，大同矿务局领导干部，在保证完成第一季度生产计划的同时，及时讨论编制了第二季度、月度的生产计划，检查了生产中的问题。第二季度问题较大的是一矿和四矿；一矿二号井在第二季度就要正式开回采出煤，但是缺少二百多工人，设备订货也还没有按时到达。现正积极着手准备，一面在当地政府协助下召收工人，调整劳力组织，一面派人分别到东北、张家口等地搬运机械设备。四矿机电事故多，中心问题是备品少，现在已由机电处大力予以解决，保证四矿第二季度备品够用。
    在第二季度该矿务局将组织同工种、同业务竞赛，保证全面地、均衡地、安全地完成生产计划。
