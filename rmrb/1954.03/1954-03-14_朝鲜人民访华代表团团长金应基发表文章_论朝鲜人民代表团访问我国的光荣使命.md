This will be of great significance to our recovery and construction efforts.

Kim Ung-ki also said: The Korean People's Delegation to China will also introduce to the great Chinese people the heroic Korean People's Army fighting on the front lines in the anti-aggression war, the workers and farmers who persist in production in the rear, the drivers on the transportation lines, the people's guerrillas behind enemy lines, the Korean men, women, old and young who sacrificed their lives to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the heroic deeds of all the Korean people who are rising up to carry out the recovery and construction work today.
