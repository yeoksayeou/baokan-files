Grassroots elections in the vast rural areas of Hebei Province are being carried out actively in close combination with production. As of March 9th, 380 townships across the province have completed grassroots elections, 8,961 townships (towns) are conducting population surveys and registration, reviewing voter qualifications, and discussing representative candidates, and 2,007 townships are establishing township election committees and training propagandists and technicians. The Baoding and Zhangjiakou Special Districts are grasping the work more tightly and progressing faster, with most townships holding election conferences; some townships that have completed elections have already convened township people's congresses.

In the grassroots election work, all localities have combined the promotion of the general line, using comparisons between the old and new societies to publicize the great significance of universal suffrage. After the masses understood the importance of consolidating the people's democratic regime, in addition to actively participating in the elections, they were also very serious about the voter qualification review work, focusing on reviewing landlords and counter-revolutionaries. For example, after the voter qualification review team of Xijing Township in Wu'an County announced the list of landlords and counter-revolutionaries to the voters, they held group discussions, and several more landlords were exposed during the discussions.

Generally, the work teams, due to a clear understanding that production is the overriding central task in rural areas, paid attention to the close combination of production and elections. Some areas even combined the elections to advance production and mutual aid cooperation a step further. For example, in the process of elections, Goutou Township in Dingxing County plowed 4,500 mu of barren land and 2,500 mu of wheat land, breaking the masses' habit of not doing farm work before and after the Spring Festival; and developed eleven mutual aid teams (79 households), and restored fourteen mutual aid teams (83 households). Added to the original mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, the number of households organized in the township has reached a robust 41.2 percent. Through grassroots elections, seventeen temporary mutual aid teams in Shigezhuang Township in Zhuozhou County were transformed into year-round mutual aid teams, and sixteen new year-round mutual aid teams and twenty temporary mutual aid teams were developed.

Judging from the areas that have completed elections, the people have been very serious and cautious in discussing representative candidates. Voters are choosing those who support the general line, have the ability to handle affairs, and can connect with the masses as representatives. Among the 27 township people's representatives elected in Goutou Township, Dingxing County, 22 (including township cadres) are cadres of agricultural producers' cooperatives or leaders of mutual aid teams. Those original grassroots cadres who are good in nature but have some shortcomings in their style of work, after making self-criticisms and expressing their determination to correct them, and obtaining the understanding of the masses, are also continuing to be elected. Mao Luocun, the civil affairs director of Dajia Township in Mancheng County, used to have a bad temper. During the general election, he made a self-criticism and expressed his determination to correct it, and as a result, he was re-elected as a representative. Through the election, grassroots cadres received a profound democratic education.

In the grassroots elections, there were also individual work team cadres who took detours in their work due to unfamiliarity with the work and policies. For example, in a polling district in Liujiaying Village, Yu County, the cadre presiding over the meeting interpreted "each voter has only one vote" as "each voter raises their hand once," resulting in neither of the two candidates receiving more than half of the votes, and a re-election had to be held. Individual cadres, due to not carefully studying the election law and the instructions of higher authorities on election work, deviated in mastering policies. For example, in Fojiazhuang Township in Dingxing County, voter qualifications were reviewed only after the election was completed. When reviewing voter qualifications in Xizhuang Township in Xushui County, the focus was not on reviewing landlords and counter-revolutionaries, but on reviewing party members and league members. Some of the above problems have been corrected, and some are being corrected.

    河北农村基层选举正积极进行
    选举工作推动了生产和互助合作运动
    河北省广大农村的基层选举工作正紧密结合生产积极进行。截至三月九日，全省已有三百八十个乡完成了基层选举，八千九百六十一个乡（镇）正在进行人口调查登记、审查选民资格和讨论代表候选人，二千零七个乡正在建立乡选举委员会、训练宣传员和技术员。保定专区和张家口专区抓得较紧，进度较快，大部分乡正召开选举大会；已经完成选举的乡有的已召开了乡人民代表大会。
    各地在基层选举工作中，都结合宣传总路线，以新旧社会对比的方法宣传了普选的伟大意义。群众懂得了巩固人民民主政权的重要意义后，除积极参加选举外，对选民资格审查工作也非常认真，着重审查了地主阶级分子和反革命分子。如武安县西井乡选民资格审查小组，向选民公布了地主阶级分子及反革命分子名单后，分组讨论，在讨论中又检举出几个地主阶级分子。
    一般地区的工作组，由于明确认识到生产是农村压倒一切的中心任务，因而注意了生产和选举密切结合进行，有的地区并结合选举把生产和互助合作向前推进了一步。如定兴县沟头乡在选举过程中，轧白地四千五百亩，麦地两千五百亩，打破了群众春节前后不做农活的习惯；并发展了十一个互助组（七十九户），恢复了十四个互助组（八十三户），加上原有互助组和农业生产合作社，全乡组织起来的农户已达到百分之四十一点二强。涿县史各庄乡通过基层选举，十七个临时互助组转为常年互助组，新发展常年互助组十六个，临时互助组二十个。
    从已经完成选举的地区来看，人民群众在讨论代表候选人时，都很认真和慎重。选民们都挑选那些拥护总路线，有办事能力，能联系群众的人当代表。定兴县沟头乡选出来的二十七名乡人民代表中，有二十二人（包括乡干部在内）是农业生产合作社的干部或互助组组长。那些本质好、只是作风上有些缺点的原基层干部，经过检讨并表示决心改正，取得群众的谅解后，也继续当选了。满城县大贾乡民政主任毛洛存过去好发脾气，在普选中自己作了检讨，并表示决心改正，结果又当选为代表。通过选举，基层干部受到了一次深刻的民主教育。
    在基层选举中，也有个别工作组的干部，由于不熟悉业务和政策，使工作走了弯路。如蔚县刘家营村一个选区，主持会议的干部把“每一选民只有一个投票权”解释为“每一个选民举一次手”，结果两个候选人所得票数均不过半数，只得重选。个别干部由于没有认真学习选举法和上级有关选举工作的指示，因而在掌握政策方面出了偏差。如定兴县富家庄乡在选举结束后，才审查选民资格。徐水县西庄乡审查选民资格时，不是着重审查地主阶级分子和反革命分子，而是审查党员团员。上述问题有的已经纠正，有的正在纠正。
