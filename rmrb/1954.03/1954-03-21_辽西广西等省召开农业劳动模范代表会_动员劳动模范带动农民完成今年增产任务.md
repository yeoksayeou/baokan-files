Liaoxi, Jilin, Guangxi, Xikang and other provinces have recently convened agricultural labor model representative conferences in order to better leverage the backbone and leading role of agricultural labor models in realizing the country's socialist transformation of agriculture and completing the agricultural production tasks for 1954.

Last year, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, based on the province's specific conditions and combined with the experience of Guo Houqi's high-yield production, proposed the production policy of "preventing drought and preserving soil moisture, appropriately dense planting, thinning seedlings to protect seedlings, and rational fertilization" and "universal publicity, key promotion" at the previous agricultural labor model representative conference, calling on labor models to lead farmers throughout the province in carrying out agricultural technology reform movements. This movement achieved great success. Although Liaoxi Province's agricultural production suffered from severe natural disasters such as spring drought, summer pests, and autumn floods last year, grain output still exceeded 1952 by 28.4 percent. Although the cotton planting area decreased by more than 35,000 hectares compared to 1952, the total cotton output still exceeded the total cotton output of 1952 by 1.1 percent. In the practice of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience, the vast number of rural cadres also transformed their general leadership style, learned the mass line work style of going deep into reality and into the production process, and emerged with many good cadres who can closely connect with the masses, study agricultural technology, and specifically lead farmers to achieve increased production. At this agricultural labor model representative conference, Qiu Youwen, Vice Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, and Xia Shangzhi, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, summarized the experience and achievements of promoting technology to increase production and mutual assistance and cooperation in 1953, and proposed that in 1954, on the basis of actively carrying out the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, continue to vigorously reform technology and strive to overfulfill the task of increasing agricultural production by 10 percent. After discussion, the representatives unanimously stated that they would definitely follow the spirit of the conference, further lead farmers to carry out agricultural technology reform movements, and strive to overfulfill this year's production increase tasks. The conference rewarded more than 650 model units and individuals.

Jilin Province also recently convened a representative conference of agricultural production models and selected labor models. Li Youwen, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and Xia Bokang, Director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture, made important reports at the conference. The conference summarized and exchanged experiences in agricultural production, mutual assistance and cooperation, animal husbandry technology, and leadership of agricultural production in 1953, and determined the guiding principles and tasks for agricultural production in 1954. The representatives expressed their confidence in resolutely implementing the Party's general line during the transition period, and in accordance with the principle of "actively leading and steadily advancing," vigorously carrying out the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, promoting technological reforms, and striving to produce 4.25 million tons of grain and 270,000 tons of industrial raw materials this year.

Guangxi Province recently convened a representative conference of agricultural labor models, supply and marketing cooperative model workers, and forest industry model workers. He Yiran, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the conference, summarizing experiences, putting forward the tasks and principles of rural work in the future, and criticizing various erroneous ideas. Many agricultural labor models attending the meeting criticized some incorrect understandings of mutual assistance and cooperation in the past during the discussion, and clarified that mutual assistance and cooperation is not only to solve difficulties, but also a path to socialism. During the conference, the representatives listened to typical speeches by agricultural labor models such as Jiang Zaiqiu, and visited factories, which further brightened their eyes and increased their confidence. Everyone expressed that they must earnestly run agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and unite and lead 40% of the province's farmers to participate in mutual assistance and cooperation organizations this year, overfulfilling the task of increasing grain production by 7% and expanding the sown area of oil crops by 11.1% in 1954. In the past, supply and marketing cooperatives were not clear about the principle of serving production. Last year, the proportion of production materials supplied by the province only accounted for 7.9%. They also did not pay attention to purchasing local handicrafts and managing local products. The conference pointed out these shortcomings and clarified the position and role of supply and marketing cooperatives in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, emphasizing that they should serve agricultural production and do everything possible to do a good job in various tasks of serving production, and meet the needs of farmers for production materials and living materials as much as possible. The conference also made arrangements for the forest industry's production tasks in 1954, mainly requiring efforts to complete timber production and ensure the needs of national construction timber. Finally, the conference awarded 410 model units and individuals in agriculture and 361 model workers in supply and marketing cooperatives. In addition, many model workers in the forest industry were also rewarded.

Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Xikang Province has made great achievements in agricultural production. The province's grain output increased by more than 5% compared with 1952, and the output of cotton and tea also increased compared with 1952. Work in forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy and other aspects has also made great achievements. In order to further implement the general line and lead the province's farmers to complete the task of increasing production in 1954, Xikang Province also recently convened a representative conference of agricultural labor models.

    辽西广西等省召开农业劳动模范代表会
    动员劳动模范带动农民完成今年增产任务
    辽西、吉林、广西、西康等省，为了更好地发挥农业劳动模范在实现国家对农业的社会主义改造、和完成一九五四年农业生产任务中的骨干和带头作用，都在最近召开了农业劳动模范代表会议。
    去年，辽西省人民政府根据该省的具体情况结合郭后旗丰产经验，在上届农业劳动模范代表会议上提出了“防旱保墒、适度密植、间苗保苗、合理施肥”及“普遍宣传、重点推广”的生产方针，号召劳动模范们带动全省农民开展农业技术改革运动。这一运动取得了很大的成绩。去年辽西省的农业生产虽然遭受到春旱、夏虫、秋涝等严重自然灾害，然而粮食的产量仍超过一九五二年的百分之二十八点四；棉花的种植面积虽较一九五二年减少三万五千多垧，但棉花的总产量仍超过一九五二年棉花总产量的百分之一点一。广大农村干部在推广肇源经验的实践中，也转变了一般化的领导作风，学会了深入实际、深入生产过程的群众路线工作作风，涌现出许多能够密切联系群众、钻研农业技术、具体领导农民实现增产的好干部。在这次农业劳动模范代表会议上，辽西省人民政府副主席仇友文、省农业厅厅长夏尚志总结了一九五三年推广技术增加生产和互助合作的经验及成绩，并提出一九五四年要在积极开展互助合作运动的基础上，继续大力改革技术，争取超额完成农业增产百分之十的任务。经过讨论，到会代表一致表示一定按照大会的精神，进一步带动农民开展农业技术改革运动，为超额完成今年增产任务努力。这次大会共奖励了六百五十多个模范单位和个人。
    吉林省最近也召开了农业生产模范代表会议，评选了劳动模范。省人民政府主席栗又文、省农业厅厅长夏伯康都在会上作了重要报告。大会总结和交流了一九五三年的农业生产、互助合作、畜牧技术和领导农业生产等各方面的经验，确定了一九五四年农业生产的方针任务，代表们都满怀信心地表示，坚决贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线，根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，大力开展互助合作运动，推行技术改革，为今年生产四百二十五万吨粮食和二十七万吨工业原料而奋斗。
    广西省最近召开了农业劳动模范、供销合作模范工作者、森林工业模范工作者代表会议。中共广西省委农村工作部部长贺亦然在会上作了报告，总结了经验，提出了今后农村工作的任务和方针，批判了各种错误思想。到会的许多农业劳动模范在讨论中批判了过去对互助合作的一些不正确的认识，明确了互助合作不但是为了解决困难，而且是走向社会主义的道路。在会议期间，代表们听了农业劳动模范蒋在球等的典型发言，又参观了工厂，眼睛更亮了，信心更高了，大家都表示一定要认真办好农业生产合作社和互助组，团结和带动全省百分之四十的农户在今年都参加互助合作组织，超额完成一九五四年粮食增产百分之七和油料作物扩大播种面积百分之十一点一的任务。供销合作社过去对为生产服务的方针不明确，去年全省供应生产资料的比重只占百分之七点九，对地方手工业进货和经营土产也不重视，这次大会指出了这些缺点，明确了供销社在促进农业社会主义改造中的地位和作用，强调要为农业生产服务，全力做好为生产服务的各项工作，尽一切可能满足农民生产资料和生活资料的需要。对森林工业一九五四年的生产任务，会议上也作了布置，主要是要求努力完成木材生产，保证国家建设用材的需要。最后，大会评奖了四百一十个农业模范单位和个人、三百六十一个供销合作模范工作者。此外还有许多森林工业模范工作者也受了奖。
    西康省的农业生产，在党和人民政府的领导下，取得了很大的成绩。全省粮食产量比一九五二年增产百分之五以上，棉花、茶叶的产量也比一九五二年有了增加，林业、畜牧、水利等方面的工作也有了很大成就。为了进一步贯彻总路线，带动全省农民完成一九五四年的增产任务，西康省也于最近召开了农业劳动模范代表会议。
