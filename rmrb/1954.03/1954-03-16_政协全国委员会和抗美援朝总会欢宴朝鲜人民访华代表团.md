    After the banquet began, Chen Shutong delivered a congratulatory speech. On behalf of the National Committee of the CPPCC and the China Peace Committee, he extended a heartfelt welcome and congratulations to Chairman Kim Ung-gi and all members of the delegation. He asked everyone to raise their glasses to the great victory of the peoples of China and Korea in opposing wars of aggression and defending world peace, to the unbreakable solidarity and friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, to the health of the wise leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il-sung, to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, to the health of the leader of the Soviet government and party, Malenkov, to the consolidation and strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the victory of the cause of peace.

    Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, then delivered a congratulatory speech. He said that the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, had twice fought together for common interests and defeated our common enemies, the Japanese aggressors and the American aggressors. In this common struggle, a deep and unbreakable friendship has been forged between the peoples of the two countries. The signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement has also laid the foundation for long-term cooperation and mutual assistance between the peoples of the two countries in the economic and cultural fields. The visit to China by the Korean People's Delegation led by Chairman Kim Ung-gi will further consolidate and develop the friendly unity and mutual cooperation between the peoples of China and Korea. We firmly believe that on the basis of the firm unity of our Chinese and Korean peoples, and on the basis of the firm unity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, our two peoples will surely continue to achieve great victories in the struggle to stop the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies, defend the independence and security of our countries, and defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

    Chairman Kim Ung-gi delivered a reply. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the grand welcome banquet held today. He said that the traditional friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Korea, which were forged in the long history and the revolutionary struggle against Japanese imperialism, have been further consolidated and developed in the just common struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, and have fully demonstrated their invincible power. The exemplary internationalist assistance shown by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers in our war of liberation for freedom and independence and the great achievements they have made will be immortal in the history of our country; we Korean people will never forget the kindness of the great Chinese people who sincerely assisted us under the lofty banner of resisting America and aiding Korea. Chairman Kim Ung-gi said that in just seven months after the armistice, many factories, cities, rural areas, and cultural and educational facilities have been rebuilt from the ruins, and the face of the northern half of our republic is rapidly changing. There is no doubt that the Korean people, who have received the internationalist support and solidarity of the great Soviet Union and China, as well as the peoples of the democratic camp, will surely achieve victory in the struggle for peaceful reunification and the restoration and development of the post-war people's economy, just as they won victory in the just war of liberation of the fatherland. Chairman Kim Ung-gi said: We Korean people and the great Chinese people are not only connected by national borders, but also have traditional friendly relations, which makes us feel infinite glory and pride. We will do everything possible to further consolidate and develop this friendship and unity. Finally, Chairman Kim Ung-gi asked everyone to drink to the long life of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.

    The banquet proceeded in a friendly atmosphere. During the banquet, the guests frequently toasted the unbreakable combat friendship between the peoples of China and Korea, and to the health of Marshal Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong.
