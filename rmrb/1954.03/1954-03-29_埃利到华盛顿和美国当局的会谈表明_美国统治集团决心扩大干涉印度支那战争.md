Xinhua News Agency, 28th. After six days of begging for US military aid in Washington, French Chief of Staff Ély left the United States on the 26th and returned to France. The consultations between Ély and the US authorities prove that the United States is determined to expand its interference in the Indochina War and is stepping up its efforts to induce France, which is increasingly dependent on US policy, to continue fighting according to the US will.

The US Department of Defense announced upon Ély's departure from Washington that the United States would send an additional 25 B-26 bombers to Indochina to support the French invading army. The United States will also supply ammunition and war materials such as parachutes. It is said that this batch of bombers will be flown to Indochina by US Air Force pilots from US air bases in the Far East. Moreover, these aircraft will participate in the battle of Dien Bien Phu within two or three days in an attempt to save the besieged French invading army from its precarious situation. According to Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, this is to "prevent the French will from wavering just before the Geneva Conference."

In order to cheer up the French colonialists, who have suffered successive defeats, the US authorities, during Ély's visit to the United States, emphasized guarantees that they would continue to provide France with substantial military aid, while also trying to make France believe in the US's "optimistic views." US President Eisenhower even personally stepped forward on the 24th, expressing his "belief" that the French colonial army would "achieve victory." As can be seen from the reports of US news agencies and newspapers, the main content of the talks between Washington and Ély was how to continue and expand the war of aggression in Indochina. According to the "New York Times," the talks even discussed the question of under what circumstances the United States would directly intervene in the war.

On the other hand, this meeting also exposed that behind the French authorities' verbal willingness to end the Indochina War through negotiations, there lies the activity of attempting to continue relying on US "aid" to sustain the war of aggression. Before Ély went to Washington, the French government had submitted a huge list of military supplies to the United States in advance, requesting the United States to provide more aircraft and landing craft. After Ély arrived in Washington, he repeatedly requested the United States to provide more military aid in order to continue the hopeless war for France. At the same time, the United States took the opportunity to further realize its goal of squeezing out France and seizing command of the Indochina War. While promising to continue to provide France with "aid," the Washington authorities did their best to force France to agree to transfer the right to train and control the Indochinese puppet army to the United States. According to a United Press report, after Ély arrived, Radford did his best to "explain the benefits of sending a US training group to Indochina" to him. Then, on the 23rd, Wilson publicly put pressure on France, arbitrarily threatening: "We are willing to assist in training work in every practically feasible way, as we have done in many other countries." He also stated that the United States' dispatch of Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel as the head of the military aid advisory group in Indochina was to train the puppet army.

Signs indicate that the United States is forcing France to prepare to pay a price on this issue. According to a United Press dispatch from Saigon on the 25th, after Ély's talks with Washington, the headquarters of French invading army commander Navarre, which had expressed opposition to the US training the puppet army, "today is 'not so uncompromising' on this issue." Two days before Ély left the United States and returned to France, a United Press report pointed out: "Radford and Wilson are now very confident that Ély will definitely persuade French Defense Minister Pleven to accept the US proposal to improve the training of the Vietnamese (puppet) troops." Moreover, O'Daniel, the new head of the US military aid advisory group in Indochina, is scheduled to bring with him a group of "first-class training officers with experience in Greece and Korea" when he goes to Indochina in the first half of April. It is said that these US officers will not directly train the puppet army at the beginning, but will start by controlling the French training institutions in order to gradually obtain the right to train and control the puppet army. United Press said: The United States is "ready" for the work of training the puppet army, and "the US technical training work in the rear areas of Indochina will be stepped up immediately."

From these circumstances, it seems that the US authorities, who are expanding their interference in the Indochina War, are not only trying to tie France tightly to the US war chariot so that it cannot move, but are also taking steps to further control the Indochina War directly.

### 埃利到华盛顿和美国当局的会谈表明  美国统治集团决心扩大干涉印度支那战争

    埃利到华盛顿和美国当局的会谈表明
    美国统治集团决心扩大干涉印度支那战争
   【新华社二十八日讯】法国总参谋长埃利在华盛顿进行了六天的乞求美国军事援助的活动之后，已在二十六日离美返法。埃利和美国当局之间的会商情况证明美国决心扩大干涉印度支那战争，并加紧诱迫愈来愈依靠美国政策的法国按照美国的意旨来继续打下去。
    美国国防部在埃利离开华盛顿时宣布：美国即将加派二十五架B二十六型轰炸机到印度支那，去支持法国侵略军。美国同时将供给弹药及降落伞等战争物资。据说，这批轰炸机将由美国空军驾驶员从美国在远东的空军基地驾驶到印度支那去。而且，这些飞机将在两三天之内参加奠边府的战斗，以图挽救被围攻中的法国侵略军的危局。按照美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福的说法，这是为了“要使法国人的意志不致于恰恰在日内瓦会议以前动摇”。
    为了替连遭败北的法国殖民者打气，美国当局在埃利访美期间一面强调保证将继续给法国以大量的军事援助，一面竭力企图使法国相信美国的“乐观看法”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在二十四日甚至亲自出马，表示“相信”法国殖民军将“获得胜利”。从美国通讯社和报刊的报道可以看出，华盛顿与埃利的会谈的主要内容是如何继续和扩大印度支那的侵略战争。据“纽约时报”报道，会谈甚至还讨论了美国准备在什么情况下直接干涉战争的问题。
    另一方面，这次会谈也暴露了在法国当局口头上表示愿意通过谈判结束印度支那战争的背后，包藏着企图继续依靠美“援”来把侵略战争撑持下去的活动。在埃利到华盛顿之前，法国政府事先已向美国提出了一张庞大的军事物资清单，要求美国给予更多的飞机和登陆艇，埃利到华盛顿以后，即一再要求美国给予更多的军事援助，以便把这场对法国说来是毫无希望的战争继续打下去。但同时，美国却乘机进一步实现其排挤法国和夺取印度支那战争指挥权的目的。华盛顿当局一面答应继续给法国以“援助”，一面竭力逼迫法国同意把对印度支那伪军的训练权和控制权转交给美国。据合众社报道，在埃利到达以后，雷德福就竭力向他“解释派遣美国训练团去印度支那的好处”。接着，威尔逊在二十三日公开对法国施加压力，专横地进行恫吓说：“我们愿意像我们在许多其他国家所做的那样，以一切实际可行的方法来协助训练工作。”他还表示，美国派遣太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔担任驻印度支那军事援助顾问团的团长，就是为了要去训练伪军。
    迹象显示，美国正在迫使法国准备在这个问题上付出代价。据合众社西贡二十五日电透露，在埃利与华盛顿会谈之后，曾经表示反对由美国来训练伪军的法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔的司令部“今天对这个问题已‘不那么不妥协’了”。在埃利离美返法以前两天，合众社消息曾经指出：“雷德福和威尔逊现在很有把握地认为埃利一定会劝法国国防部长普利文接受美国关于改进越南（傀儡）部队训练工作的建议。”而且，新任美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长的奥丹尼尔，预定在四月上半月去印度支那时，还将随身带去一批“在希腊和朝鲜有经验的第一流训练军官”。据说，这些美国军官在开始时暂不直接训练伪军，而是从控制法国的训练机构着手，以便逐步地取得对伪军的训练权和控制权。合众社说：美国对于训练伪军的工作“已经作好了准备”，“在印度支那后方地区的美国技术训练工作将会马上加紧进行”。
    从这些情况看来，正在扩大干涉印度支那战争的美国当局，不但企图把法国紧紧地缚在美国的战车上使它动弹不得，而且正在采取步骤企图进一步由美国来直接控制印度支那战争。
