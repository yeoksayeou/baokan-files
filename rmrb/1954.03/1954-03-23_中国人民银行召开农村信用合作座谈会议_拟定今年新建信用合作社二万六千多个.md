Xinhua News Agency:

    The People's Bank of China held its first rural credit cooperative symposium from February 20th to March 7th. The meeting tentatively planned to establish 26,527 new credit cooperatives and 2,965 credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide in 1954.

    During the meeting, Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, attended and gave important instructions. Deng Zihui emphasized that the basic task of rural credit work is to support agricultural production, solve farmers' difficulties, promote the development of agricultural production to meet the needs of socialist industrialization, further improve farmers' lives, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; at the same time, it is to fight against rural usury, gradually squeeze out usury, and finally have state banks and mass credit cooperatives completely occupy the rural credit front and completely eliminate usury. To complete these two tasks, in addition to state banks issuing agricultural loans, it is also necessary to develop mass credit cooperative organizations. However, the development of credit cooperative undertakings currently appears slow and cannot meet objective requirements. We should actively lead, rapidly develop, and occupy the rural credit front as soon as possible.

    In recent years, under the leadership of local CPC committees and people's governments, and the efforts of bank cadres, the number of business offices of the People's Bank in districts has increased from 457 in 1950 to 13,290 in 1953. The number of credit cooperatives and credit departments of supply and marketing cooperatives has grown from 542 in 1950 to 9,831 in 1953. In areas where credit cooperative organizations are relatively developed, a rural financial network has been initially formed, usury has been greatly impacted, and credit cooperation has powerfully supported agricultural production. However, the development of credit cooperative work is very uneven. About 50% of the counties nationwide have few or no credit cooperative organizations, and about 30% of the existing credit cooperatives are still not very consolidated.

    Regarding the development of credit cooperative undertakings, the meeting decided to adopt the policy of active leadership and steady progress. In areas with a relatively good foundation, the goal is to basically achieve universal credit cooperation within two to three years; the development time can be appropriately extended in areas with a relatively poor foundation; as for areas with no experience in running cooperatives, pilot projects must be carried out to gain experience before promotion. In areas where credit cooperatives already have a foundation, such as Shanxi, Hebei, and Jiangxi provinces, the development of credit cooperatives can be the main focus. In areas where establishing credit departments on the basis of supply and marketing cooperatives has proven effective, such as Northeast China and Shandong, pilot credit cooperatives can be emphasized, and credit departments can be universally developed, and then converted to credit cooperatives when conditions permit. In areas where credit cooperative organizations have no foundation and the masses urgently need to solve borrowing difficulties (including villages that cannot directly establish credit cooperatives at present), mutual credit groups should be widely developed. In short, all localities can adopt various organizational forms according to their existing experience and the conditions of the masses.

    The meeting studied the leadership of credit cooperative work and how to consolidate credit cooperatives. The meeting believes that credit cooperatives and credit departments must conduct deposit and loan business under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the government, in conjunction with the central tasks. The development direction, development plan, cadre training, etc., of credit cooperatives must be approved by the local Party committee for unified deployment. Other work must also rely on the leadership of the Party committee. Bank cadres must regularly report the situations and problems discovered in the business of leading credit cooperatives to the Party committee to obtain instructions and assistance.

    中国人民银行召开农村信用合作座谈会议
    拟定今年新建信用合作社二万六千多个
    中国人民银行总行在二月二十日到三月七日举行了第一次农村信用合作座谈会议。会议初步拟定一九五四年全国要新建信用合作社二万六千五百二十七个，供销合作社的信用部二千九百六十五个。
    会议进行中，中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢曾到会作了重要指示。邓子恢着重指出：农村信贷工作的基本任务是为了支援农业生产，解决农民困难，促进农业生产的发展，以适应社会主义工业化的需要，进一步改善农民生活，巩固工农联盟；同时和农村高利贷作斗争，逐渐排挤高利贷，最后由国家银行和群众的信用合作社全部占领农村的信贷阵地，完全消灭高利贷。要完成这两个任务，除国家银行发放农业贷款外，还要发展群众性的信用合作组织。但是目前信用合作事业的发展显得缓慢，不能适应客观要求，应该积极领导，迅速发展，尽快占领农村的信贷阵地。
    几年来，在各地中共党委和人民政府的领导以及银行干部的努力下，人民银行在区的营业所已由一九五零年的四百五十七个增加到一九五三年的一万三千二百九十个。信用合作社和供销合作社的信用部已由一九五零年的五百四十二个发展到一九五三年的九千八百三十一个。在信用合作组织比较发展的地区，农村金融网已经初步形成，高利贷已受到很大打击，信用合作有力地支援了农业生产。但是信用合作工作发展得很不平衡，全国约有百分之五十的县还没有或很少有信用合作组织，而现有的信用合作社中约有百分之三十左右还很不巩固。
    关于信用合作事业的发展，会议决定采取积极领导、稳步前进的方针。在基础比较好的地区，拟在两三年内基本上做到信用合作普遍化；基础比较差的地区发展时间可适当放长；至于还没有办社经验的地区，必须经过典型试办，取得经验，再行推广。在信用合作社已有基础的地区，如山西、河北、江西等省，可以发展信用合作社为主。在供销合作社基础上建立信用部已有经验的地区，如东北、山东等地，可以重点试办信用合作社，普遍发展信用部，等条件具备后再转为信用合作社。在信用合作组织还没有基础，群众又迫切要求解决借贷困难的地区（包括目前不能直接建立信用合作组织的乡村在内），则广泛发展信用互助组。总之，各地可根据已有经验和群众条件，采取多种多样的组织形式。
    会议对信用合作工作的领导以及如何巩固信用合作社的问题，作了研究。会议认为，信用合作社和信用部必须在党委和政府的统一领导下，结合中心任务，来进行存款放款业务。信用合作社的发展方针、发展计划、干部训练等等，均须经当地党委批准，统一部署。其他工作也都要依靠党委的领导。银行干部要经常把领导信用合作社的业务中发现的情况和问题向党委汇报，取得指示和帮助。
