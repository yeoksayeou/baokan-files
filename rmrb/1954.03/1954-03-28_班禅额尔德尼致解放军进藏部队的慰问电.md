To all commanders and fighters of the esteemed PLA entering Tibet:

    On the occasion of the Tibetan local monks and lay people慰问ing the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet, I, on behalf of all officials and monks and lay people of Tashilhunpo Monastery, extend my cordial greetings to you. In the past three years, you have demonstrated the excellent qualities of the people's army in carrying out the glorious task of liberating Tibet, and you have also demonstrated your determination to faithfully serve the Tibetan people. For the liberation of the Tibetan people, you have carried forward the spirit of high patriotism, overcome all difficulties, and vigilantly guarded the border of the motherland at all times. On the other hand, with noble and proactive actions, you have achieved brilliant achievements in all work such as building the Kangzang Highway and production and construction, which have brought happiness to our Tibetan people and opened up a new path. Especially under the various loans and relief provided by you, the poor Tibetan people, who have been impoverished for many years, deeply feel the warmth after liberation. They have also actively participated in production, and people in many areas have automatically reclaimed wasteland, thereby increasing their income. Because you correctly implement ethnic policies, protect Lama temples, respect religious customs and habits, and take exemplary actions in enforcing discipline, you have left an unforgettable impression in the minds of the local government and the vast Tibetan people, thereby strengthening the unity of our Han and Tibetan brothers and sisters. They spread the word everywhere: "Chairman Mao's army is truly the people's army, the best army there is." All of these are worthy of our admiration and learning. On this occasion of慰问, I, on behalf of all officials, monks and lay people of Tashilhunpo Monastery, wish you greater achievements in the second year of the motherland's first five-year economic construction plan, and hope that we will resolutely unite more closely under the banner of Chairman Mao in the future, to further strengthen the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the unity within the Tibetan people, to consolidate the southwest defense of the motherland, and to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, and offer a brocade banner. I wish you good health. Long live the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities! Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army! Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China!
      Panchen Erdeni

    班禅额尔德尼致解放军进藏部队的慰问电
    敬爱的进藏部队全体指战员：
    值此西藏地方僧俗人民慰问中国人民解放军进藏部队之际，我谨代表札什伦布寺全体官员和僧俗人民，向您们致以亲切的慰问。三年来，您们在执行解放西藏的光荣任务中，表现了人民军队的优良品质，也表现了您们忠实为西藏人民服务的决心。为了西藏人民的解放，您们发扬了高度爱国主义的精神，战胜了一切困难，时刻警惕地守卫着祖国的边防。另一方面您们以高尚积极的行动，在修筑康藏公路、生产建设等一切工作上，都取得了光辉的成就，这些都给我们藏族人民带来了幸福，开辟了崭新的道路。尤其在您们帮助进行的各种贷款和救济下，多年来贫困的西藏人民深深感到解放后的温暖，他们也积极地参加了生产，很多地区的人民都自动开垦了荒地，因而增加了收入。由于您们正确执行民族政策，保护了喇嘛寺庙，尊重宗教风俗习惯和执行纪律的模范行动，在当地政府和广大藏族人民心目中，留下了永远不可遗忘的影响，从而加强了我们汉、藏兄弟民族的团结。他们四处传说：“毛主席的军队真是人民的军队，是再好没有的军队。”这些都是值得我们钦佩和学习的。当此慰问之际，我代表札什伦布寺全体官员、僧俗人民谨祝您们在祖国第一个五年经济建设计划的第二个年头里，获得更大的成就，并望我们今后坚决在毛主席的旗帜下，更亲密地团结起来，为进一步加强汉、藏民族的团结和藏族人民内部的团结，为巩固祖国西南国防，建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力，并奉献锦旗一面。祝您们身体健康。汉、藏民族团结万岁！中国人民解放军万岁！中国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！班禅额尔德尼
