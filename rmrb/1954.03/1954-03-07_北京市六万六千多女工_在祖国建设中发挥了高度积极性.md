    More Than 66,000 Female Workers in Beijing
    Display High Enthusiasm in the Construction of the Motherland
    The number of female workers in Beijing is now over 66,000, nearly double the number in 1952. This female workforce has become an indispensable force in the construction of the capital.
    Many departments that previously never employed women now have female workers participating. Units that previously had few female workers have seen a general increase in their numbers. In the factories and enterprises of the capital, there are many female technicians, as well as female foundry workers, fitters, lathe operators, electricians, and mechanical repair workers. In the transportation sector, they serve as conductors and drivers on trams and buses, and as attendants, baggage handlers, and train conductors on railways. In the postal and telecommunications departments, there has also been a significant increase in the number of female telephone operators and postal workers. On many construction sites, female bricklayers and female technicians operating cement mixers have appeared. Many female road roller drivers and sanitation workers have also appeared on construction sites and streets.
    Female workers have demonstrated great enthusiasm and initiative in their respective positions. Over the past year, a large number of female workers in factories and enterprises have been recognized as labor models and advanced producers. At the Qinghe Woolen Mill, one-third of the labor models and advanced producers selected were female workers. Among the 130 prize-winning employees at the Beijing Knitted and Printed Fabric Factory, 73 were female workers. In nine units, including the People's Printing Factory, there were 227 female advanced producers. Liu Shimei, a fine yarn worker at the Qinghe Woolen Mill, Wang Caixian from the People's Printing Factory, and Hu Kuiying, a conductor from the Tram Company, have been recognized as labor models for their excellent performance at work for consecutive years. In 1952, Liu Shimei and several young female workers in her group applied the Hao Jianxiu work method to the woolen spinning machines, increasing the spindle tending capacity from 200 spindles to 400 spindles. In last year's increase production and practice economy campaign, they devised a method to further increase the spindle tending capacity to 600 spindles per person. Liu Kanmi, a young female worker in the machine and tool workshop of the Beijing Auto Parts Factory, improved operating procedures in last year's increase production and practice economy campaign, exceeding the state plan every month. She said, "Only in this way can we enable the motherland to transition to a socialist society at an early date."
    Many female employees in municipal departments have demonstrated a high level of service to the people. Yang Sushen, a female tram conductor, devised many ways to ensure that passengers could reach their work posts on time, enabling them to board quickly and ensuring that the trams arrived on schedule. She also frequently helped the elderly and children on and off the tram. Li Peilin, an international telephone operator at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's long-distance exchange, is only nineteen years old and looks like a young girl, but she is very serious and conscientious at work. She did not make any mistakes throughout 1953. She has a special respect for Soviet experts. She said, "Soviet experts are not afraid of any hardships to help our country carry out economic construction. I would feel very sad if I couldn't connect them with a phone call." Once, she received a long-distance call from Moscow for a Soviet expert, and she immediately connected it to the expert's office. But the expert was not there, so she tried every possible means to reach him in his dormitory and at meeting venues, until the expert was finally connected. December 26, 1953, was the day of the groundbreaking ceremony for the three major projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. This was a great event for the Chinese and Soviet people, but unfortunately, the long-distance telephone machine malfunctioned. This young woman displayed great wisdom, overcame all difficulties, and finally transmitted the good news to Moscow in a timely manner.
    The ideological awareness of female workers has also greatly improved in production and political movements. In this general election in the urban areas, many female workers actively participated in the election, and 44 female workers were elected as people's representatives. Many outstanding female workers have been promoted to work in the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations. Some highly conscious female workers have gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    Factories and enterprises are concerned about the political and technical improvement of female workers, and have organized technical training classes specifically for female workers, or use the method of signing apprenticeship contracts to improve their political and professional skills. Last year, more than 1,200 female workers studied at the Party School of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Staff and Workers School of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, and three female workers were sent to study at the Renmin University of China. The female apprentices at the Shijingshan Power Plant, who joined the factory in 1950, are now generally second- or third-grade workers, and some have been promoted to fourth-grade workers. Han Zhengqin, a female worker in the turbine workshop, has been trained to become a generator driver.
    Enterprises are also very concerned about the lives of female workers. In order to help female workers concentrate on production and relieve them of childcare burdens, 96 nurseries and infant rooms have been established in various factories and enterprises in recent years, caring for a total of more than 1,800 children. The No. 401 Factory, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Xinhua Printing Factory, and People's Printing Factory alone have four nurseries and five infant rooms, where 350 children are well cared for.

    北京市六万六千多女工
    在祖国建设中发挥了高度积极性
    北京市的女工现在约有六万六千多人，比一九五二年增加近一倍。这支女工队伍已成为首都建设事业中不可缺少的力量。
    许多过去从来没有妇女参加工作的部门，现在也都有妇女参加了。过去女工很少的单位，现在普遍增多了。在首都的工厂企业里，有不少女技术员和女铸工、钳工、车工、电工和机械修理工。在交通事业部门中，她们担任着电车、汽车上的售票员、司机和铁路上的乘务员、行李员、车长等职务。在邮电部门中，女话务员和女邮递员也有显著增加。在许多建筑工地上，出现了女瓦工和操纵洋灰搅拌机的女技工。许多女压路碾司机和清洁队员，也在工地和街头出现了。
    女工们在自己的岗位上，表现了极大的热情和积极性。一年来，在工厂和企业单位中，有大量的女职工被评为劳动模范和先进生产者。清河制呢厂评选的劳动模范和先进生产者中，有三分之一是女工。北京机织印染厂一百三十名得奖的职工中，有七十三名是女工。人民印刷厂等九个单位，即有女先进生产者二百二十七人。清河制呢厂细纱工刘世梅、人民印刷厂王彩仙和电车公司售票员胡奎英等，由于工作中的优良成绩，连年被评为劳动模范。刘世梅和她们小组的几个年青女工，在一九五二年把郝建秀工作法用到毛纺机上，使看锭能力由二百锭提高到四百锭，在去年增产节约竞赛中，她们又想办法使每人看锭能力提高到六百锭。北京汽车配件厂机钳车间青年女工刘堪密，去年在增产节约竞赛中改进了操作规程，每月都超额完成国家计划。她说：“只有这样才能使祖国早日过渡到社会主义社会。”
    许多市政部门的女职工们表现了高度的为人民服务的工作态度。电车女售票员杨素慎为了使乘客及时到达工作岗位，想了很多办法，使乘客迅速上车，保证了行车正点到站，并经常扶老携幼上下车。北京市电信局长途台国际话务员李佩琳今年才十九岁，看去完全是一个小姑娘，可是工作起来却很严肃、认真。在一九五三年整一年中，她没有发生过任何差错。她对苏联专家特别敬爱。她说：“苏联专家不怕任何艰苦来帮助我们国家进行经济建设，我要是为他们接不通电话就感到非常难过。”有一次她接到从莫斯科给一位苏联专家打来的长途电话，她便立刻接往专家办公室。可巧专家不在，于是她想尽了一切办法转到宿舍、会场，一直到专家通了话为止。一九五三年十二月二十六日，是鞍山钢铁公司三大工程开工典礼的日子，这是中国人民和苏联人民的大喜事，可是不巧长途电话机发生了故障。这位年轻姑娘发挥了极高的智慧，克服一切困难，终于将喜讯及时传达到莫斯科。
    女工们在生产中和政治运动中，思想觉悟也有很大提高。这次在城区普选中，许多女工都积极参加了选举，并有四十四名女工被选为人民代表。很多优秀的女工被提拔去做党、行政、工会、青年团的工作。有些觉悟很高的女工，已光荣地参加了中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团。
    各厂矿企业单位关怀女工们的政治和技术的提高，专为女工们举办了技术训练班，或用订立师徒合同的办法来提高她们的政治和业务水平。去年到中国共产党北京市委员会党校和北京市总工会职工学校学习的女工就有一千二百多名，有三个女工被送进中国人民大学学习。石景山发电厂的女徒工，是一九五零年入厂的，现在一般都是二、三级工人了，有的已升为四级工。汽机车间女工韩正勤已被培养成为发电机的司机了。
    各企业单位对女工生活也很关切。为了帮助女工们安心生产，解除孩子牵累，几年来各个厂矿企业中已建立起九十六个托儿所和乳儿室，受托的孩子共有一千八百多个。只四零一工厂、清河制呢厂、新华印刷厂、人民印刷厂四个单位，就有四个托儿所和五个乳儿室，那里有三百五十个孩子得到妥善的照顾。　（新华社）
