Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 8th: This year, farmers in the Southwest Region will produce more grain, cotton, oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and other industrial raw materials to further support national industrial construction. The Southwest Region's 1954 agricultural production plan stipulates that the entire region should increase grain production by 6.2% compared to 1953, cotton by 12.61%, various oilseeds by 24%, flue-cured tobacco by 35.12%, sugarcane by 9.39%, tea by 12.37%, and other products such as livestock, aquatic products, and vegetables in the suburbs of large cities should also be appropriately increased. Based on the situation that the potential for agricultural production in the Southwest Region is still very large, the plan also stipulates that the main methods for increasing production are to increase yield per unit area, while expanding the planting area of some crops. The area of grain crops will be expanded by 0.1%, cotton by 5.14%, various oil crops by 19.23%, and flue-cured tobacco by 23.57%.

Although the Southwest Region has increased production year after year since liberation, the potential for agricultural production is still very large. Since the launch of the general line propaganda in various places last November, mutual aid and cooperation organizations have been consolidated and developed more than before, and farmers' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. As of mid-February this year, 744 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang provinces and the suburbs of Chongqing. Mutual aid teams in various places have developed even more. During last winter's production, farmers in various places generally devoted themselves to accumulating fertilizer and controlling rice borers, and farmers in hilly and mountainous areas also widely carried out land improvement. At present, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers in various provinces has increased compared to the same period last year, and Yunnan Province generally exceeds the same period last year by 10 to 15 percent.

In the Southwest Region, the biggest impact on agricultural production is drought. Therefore, all localities attach great importance to building water conservancy projects and strengthening water management. Mass campaigns to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have been widely launched in more than 30 special districts throughout the region. In Yuxi and Qujing special districts of Yunnan Province, more than 6,000 ponds and dams have been repaired. Zunyi Special District in Guizhou Province has newly built and renovated more than 980 ponds, which can irrigate more than 58,000 mu of land. In Sichuan Province, if one-third of the original ponds and weirs can be repaired and rational water use is implemented, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 920,000 mu.

This year, agricultural and forestry departments at all levels in the Southwest Region will further strengthen technical guidance to farmers. Various localities universally rectified agricultural technology promotion agencies last winter. Sichuan, Guizhou, Xikang and other provinces also trained more than 1,000 agricultural technical cadres, preparing to continue to promote advanced experiences such as "good seeds and strong seedlings, sparse planting, and rational fertilization" of rice this year, and to help farmers improve farming techniques. This year, Sichuan Province will focus on carrying out rental services for new-style walking plows, animal-drawn farm implements, sprayers, cotton gins, and corn threshers to help farmers produce. In addition, state-owned farms in various places will further strengthen demonstration guidance to agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and the vast number of farmers. The entire region is also preparing to build four new state-owned mechanized farms this year.

At present, farmers in various parts of the Southwest Region are confidently preparing to welcome spring plowing and production, and are working hard to achieve this year's agricultural production plan.

    西南区订出今年农业增产计划
    各地农民生产热情很高积极准备春耕
    【新华社重庆八日电】今年西南区农民为进一步支援国家工业建设，将生产更多的粮食和棉花、油料、烤烟、甘蔗等工业原料。西南区一九五四年农业生产计划规定，全区要比一九五三年增产粮食百分之六点二，棉花百分之十二点六一，各种油料百分之二十四，烤烟百分之三十五点一二，甘蔗百分之九点三九，茶叶百分之十二点三七，其他如牲畜、水产和大城市郊区的蔬菜也都要适当增产。根据西南区农业生产的潜在力还很大的情况，计划还规定增产的办法主要是提高单位面积产量，同时扩大一部分作物的种植面积。粮食作物将扩大百分之零点一，棉花扩大百分之五点一四，各种油料作物扩大百分之十九点二三，烤烟扩大百分之二十三点五七。
    西南区虽在解放后连年增产，但农业生产上的潜在力仍然很大。自去年十一月各地展开总路线的宣传后，互助合作组织已较前巩固和发展，农民生产热情空前高涨。今年二月中旬为止，四川、贵州、云南、西康四省和重庆市郊区已新建立农业生产合作社七百四十四个。各地互助组有更大的发展。在去年冬季生产中，各地农民普遍投入积肥和治螟，丘陵地带和山区的农民还广泛进行了土地加工。现在，各省农民已积肥料都比去年同时期增加，云南省各地一般都超过去年同时期百分之十到十五。
    在西南区，对农业生产影响最大的是旱灾。因此，各地都很重视兴修水利和加强用水管理。全区三十多个专区已普遍展开群众性的兴修小型农田水利工作。云南省玉溪、曲靖两专区已整修塘坝六千多处。贵州省遵义专区新修和整修塘九百八十多口，可灌溉五万八千多亩田。四川省如能把原有塘堰的三分之一整修好，加上实行合理用水，就能扩大灌溉面积九十二万亩以上。
    西南区各级农林部门今年将进一步加强对农民的技术指导。各地在去年冬季曾普遍整顿了农业技术推广机构，四川、贵州、西康等省还调训了一千多名农业技术干部，准备今年继续推广水稻“好种壮苗、少秧密植、合理施肥”等先进经验，并帮助农民改进耕作技术。四川省今年将有重点地举办新式步犁、马拉农具、喷雾器、轧花机和玉米脱粒机等的租借工作，帮助农民生产。此外，各地国营农场也将进一步加强对农业生产互助合作组织和广大农民的示范指导。全区今年还准备新办国营机耕农场四处。
    目前，西南区各地农民正满怀信心地准备迎接春耕生产，为实现今年农业生产计划而努力。
