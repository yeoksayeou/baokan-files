What is an Agricultural Production Cooperative?
Yan Ling

The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have pointed out a bright road to a happy socialist society for the peasants of the whole country, which is to organize and cooperate with each other. Generally speaking, it means: first organize mutual aid teams, and then organize agricultural production cooperatives. There are two types of mutual aid teams: temporary mutual aid teams and year-round mutual aid teams. There are also two types of agricultural production cooperatives: semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives (i.e., collective farms).

There are already more than ten million mutual aid teams in the country, and mutual aid teams will continue to be greatly developed in the future. After peasants have developed the habit of collective labor in mutual aid teams, gained experience in collective production, and produced backbones who take the lead in serving everyone, they can further organize agricultural production cooperatives.

There are already more than ten thousand agricultural production cooperatives in the country, and tens of thousands of new agricultural production cooperatives are about to be established. Among these agricultural production cooperatives, only a small number are fully socialist in nature, and the vast majority are still semi-socialist in nature. The semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative is a relatively advanced form of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organization at present, a step forward compared to the mutual aid team; at the same time, it is a relatively lower form compared to the fully socialist agricultural production cooperative, and is a transitional form towards a fully socialist cooperative.

    Nature – A Semi-Socialist Production Organization of Laboring Peasants

A semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative has both cooperative and private properties.

Its most obvious characteristic is that land is contributed as shares and managed uniformly by the cooperative. Except for a small portion set aside for each member's household for growing vegetables, etc., all of the member’s household land is contributed to the cooperative. What crops to plant on that land and what fertilizers to apply are planned uniformly by the cooperative; who will tend to those fields is dispatched uniformly by the cooperative; where to dig wells, open ditches, repair ponds, improve soil, and level the terrain is arranged uniformly by the cooperative; and the grain, cotton, and other things harvested from the fields are distributed uniformly by the cooperative. The land is still privately owned by each household, and a portion of the cooperative's income is distributed to each household according to the amount, distance, and quality of the land contributed to the cooperative.

Another characteristic is the implementation of a certain distribution system based on labor. The more and better someone works, the more income they receive.

Another characteristic is the unified allocation of labor and the implementation of more detailed and reasonable division of labor, assigning work according to each person's expertise. Men, women, old, young, and even the weak and disabled can all have suitable work to do. Because the division of labor is more detailed, it is also possible to pay attention to improving technology; because labor efficiency is improved, it is also possible to operate more sidelines that are conducive to the development of agricultural production, enabling members to increase their income more.

Another characteristic is the accumulation of more public property and the use of larger, newer farm implements, which can increase production more.

Unified use of land and livestock farm implements, unified use of labor, a certain distribution according to labor, and accumulation of public property – these are the socialist components in the agricultural production cooperative. Land and some farm implements and livestock are still privately owned, and a certain reward must be distributed, which is not a socialist method. The reason for saying it is semi-socialist in nature lies here.

    Purpose – Develop Agricultural Production, Common Prosperity for All

What kind of undertakings should an agricultural production cooperative operate?

Since it is a production organization of the working people and is semi-socialist in nature, it should use its main strength to develop agricultural production, increase the yields of grain, cotton, and other crops, support national industrial construction, and improve the lives of all members. The cooperative can also operate various sideline occupations that are helpful to agricultural production, such as forestry, animal husbandry, fishing, and handicrafts; but it must absolutely not engage in commerce (it is best for agricultural production cooperatives to buy and sell things through supply and marketing cooperatives), and it must absolutely not engage in usury (it is best to deposit the money that is temporarily not needed in agricultural production cooperatives in the state bank or credit cooperative). Whether operating agriculture or sidelines, it is absolutely forbidden to hire long-term workers. Each member shall not hire long-term workers to join the cooperative, and the cooperative shall not hire long-term workers. These are all things that exploit people and are incompatible with the nature of agricultural production cooperatives. Running agricultural production cooperatives is taking the socialist road, the purpose of which is to enrich all working peasants; no one is allowed to sneak into the cooperative to exploit other members, and agricultural production cooperatives will never exploit anyone outside the cooperative. However, because the cooperative lacks skilled people, it is permissible to hire people from outside the cooperative as technicians and people from outside the cooperative as accountants because the cooperative lacks people who can calculate and keep accounts, giving them reasonable salaries; it is also permissible to hire a small number of short-term workers during busy farming seasons in order to save time.

    Members – Only Laboring Peasants Can Participate

Who can join an agricultural production cooperative?

It must be laboring peasants who can participate. Laboring peasants above a certain age (for example, the age is stipulated as sixteen in the Northeast and North China), whether male or female, as long as they voluntarily abide by the cooperative's rules and regulations and participate in certain labor within the cooperative according to their ability (managing the affairs of the cooperative and being an accountant also counts as labor, which is called mental labor), can join the cooperative with the approval of the members' meeting. Counter-revolutionaries, landlords who have not changed their class status, rich peasants, and merchants shall not join the cooperative. Why? Because agricultural production cooperatives are semi-socialist organizations of laboring peasants, they cannot allow exploiters and counter-revolutionaries to participate. Allowing them to participate is actually allowing them to sneak in to carry out exploitation and sabotage, hindering everyone from moving forward step by step on the socialist road; it may even cause the cooperative to change its nature and become an organization that exploits and oppresses the working people, no longer a semi-socialist cooperative. Can former counter-revolutionaries who have been reformed through labor and have had their control lifted, landlords and rich peasants who have changed their class status, and merchants who have given up commercial activities and participated in agricultural labor for a certain period of time and changed their class status join the cooperative? This can be discussed and decided by the members' meeting. Even if everyone allows these people to join the cooperative, they cannot be allowed to be leaders, and they must continue to strengthen education on the one hand and prevent them from carrying out sabotage activities on the other.

Membership in the cooperative is voluntary and never forced; withdrawal from the cooperative is free and never retained. Anyone can withdraw from the cooperative if they feel it does not suit them after joining the cooperative. When withdrawing from the cooperative, his land, farm implements, livestock, and other production investments will be returned to him. If the land has been processed, improved, or water conservancy projects have been built after it was contributed to the cooperative, the person withdrawing from the cooperative should give the cooperative a certain reward. In short, neither should the person withdrawing from the cooperative suffer losses, nor should the cooperative suffer losses. In fact, as long as the cooperative is run well, very few people will want to withdraw from the cooperative.

    Organization – Implement Democratic Centralism

Who manages the affairs of the cooperative?

Since the agricultural production cooperative is a production organization of the working peasants themselves, the affairs of the cooperative should be managed by all the members. Everyone manages, but it does not mean that many people should come to "mess up the house." If everyone "messes up the house," the affairs of the group will not be handled well. Since it is an organization, it must operate according to certain organizational principles. What organizational principle does the agricultural production cooperative operate according to? It is democratic centralism. That is to say: everyone should run the house, but not "mess up the house." Major issues should be decided by holding a members' meeting; larger cooperatives can also hold a members' representative meeting to decide (the representatives are also elected by everyone). The things that the general meeting of all members or the meeting of members' representatives should manage are: electing the chairman and vice-chairman (i.e., the cooperative director), the management committee (some also call it the board of directors), and the supervisory committee (smaller cooperatives may not set up a supervisory committee and be directly supervised by the members), discussing and approving the cooperative's production plan and financial plan, discussing and deciding how much to retain for the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund each year and how to use it, discussing and deciding how to calculate labor days and how to distribute income, approving the admission of new members, deciding on rewards and punishments for members, and discussing other major issues.

The daily affairs of the cooperative are managed by the management committee elected by everyone. Under the leadership of the chairman, the management committee operates according to the resolutions of the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting. The management committee is responsible for arranging the daily work of the cooperative.

The things that the supervisory committee should manage are: supervising whether the management committee has implemented the resolutions of the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting, putting forward opinions on handling personnel who have not fulfilled their responsibilities and have done wrong things for the cooperative, supervising the cooperative's financial management to prevent corruption and waste, and also supervising the members to operate according to the rules and regulations discussed and decided by everyone.

The cooperative can organize the members into several production teams or production groups according to the actual needs of production. Each team or group elects a captain or group leader to carry out production labor under the leadership of the management committee. The management committee assigns the things to be done by the cooperative to each team or group, and the captain or group leader assigns these things to each person according to their expertise and leads everyone to work together.

After joining the cooperative, does one have to be managed by others and have no personal freedom? Of course, the cooperative must have certain rules and regulations, and everyone must operate according to the rules and regulations. If everyone does what they want and uses whatever they want from the cooperative at will, the cooperative will collapse. Since everyone wants to join the cooperative or has already joined the cooperative, they are determined to run the cooperative well and will certainly not want to collapse the cooperative, and naturally they will be willing to abide by these rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are not made by one person or a few people and forced on everyone to abide by, but are made through democratic discussion at the members' meeting according to needs.

    Future – Step by Step Towards a Socialist Agricultural Production Cooperative

The semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative is only a section on the road to socialism, and it will still take a considerable amount of time to reach a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative.

Some people say, since socialism is good, why not immediately run a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative (collective farm)? You need to know that a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative is where land, large farm implements, and draft animals are owned by all members, large-scale production is carried out using new technologies, and agricultural and sideline products are distributed entirely according to the amount and quality of labor. That is good, but generally speaking, it is still difficult to do right now. Because, only when production has been increased quite a lot, and the income without land dividends is more than when there was no cooperative, and everyone's awareness has been improved, is it possible for everyone to agree not to pay land dividends, and is it also possible to accumulate more public property and use new farm implements and new technologies to carry out larger-scale production. At present, on the one hand, the vast majority of peasants still find it difficult to change the thinking and habits of relying on private land for generations; on the other hand, our agricultural technology is still very backward, and we also lack experience and backbones in managing large-scale agricultural production. These habits, experiences, backbones, and technologies can all be obtained from semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives.

The semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative is not static. It is a transitional form to fully socialism; it is constantly changing. Its scale will grow from smaller to larger, its system will grow from simpler to more complex, its proportion of labor dividends will gradually increase with the development of production and the improvement of mass awareness, its accumulation of public property will grow from less to more; the habits, experiences, backbones, and technologies of collective management will also become better and more mature year by year, and the output and everyone's income will become richer year by year. In the end, we can move towards a happier and more fulfilling socialism.

From mutual aid teams to fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives, it is like the fruit trees we plant. First, there is a little socialist bud, the bud gradually emerges from the soil and becomes a seedling, gradually grows into a small tree with branches and leaves, and gradually grows into a large tree that blooms and bears fruit. We can eat more and more fragrant and sweet fruits.

### 什么是农业生产合作社

专栏：怎样办农业生产合作社

    编者按：本报从今天起，陆续发表“怎样办农业生产合作社”的一批文章。这些文章，可以作为农村工作干部学习的材料，也可以作为向农业生产合作社社员和一般农民群众进行宣传教育的材料。
    什么是农业生产合作社
    燕凌
    共产党和毛主席给全国农民指出了一条走到幸福的社会主义社会去的光明大道，就是组织起来，互助合作。一般地说，就是：先组织互助组，再组织农业生产合作社。互助组有两种：一种是临时互助组，一种是常年互助组。农业生产合作社也有两种：一种是半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，一种是完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（就是集体农庄）。
    现在全国已经有了一千多万个互助组，今后也还要大大发展互助组。农民们在互助组里养成了集体劳动的习惯，有了集体生产的经验，产生出来了带头为大家办事的骨干，就可以更进一步组织农业生产合作社了。
    现在全国已经有了一万多个农业生产合作社，还有几万个新的农业生产合作社就要成立。这些农业生产合作社里头，只有很少一些是完全社会主义性质的，绝大部分都还是半社会主义性质的。半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社是现时农业生产互助合作组织的比较高级的形式，比互助组前进了一步；同时，它和完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社比起来又是比较低级的形式，是走向完全社会主义性质的合作社的过渡形式。
    性质——劳动农民的半社会
        主义性质的生产组织
    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社有合作的和私有的两方面的性质。
    它的最明显的特点，就是土地入股，归社里统一经营。社员家里的土地，除各自留出来一小部分做种菜等等之用以外，都入到社里。那块地种什么庄稼、施什么肥料，由社里统一计划；那些地由那些人侍弄，由社里统一调度；什么地方要打井、开沟、修塘、改良土壤、修整地形，由社里统一安排；地里收的粮食、棉花等等东西，由社里统一分配。土地还是归各家私有的，社里的收入有一部分是按入社土地的多少、远近、好坏给各家分配的。
    它的又一个特点，就是实行一定的按劳分配制度。谁劳动得越多越好，谁的收入就越多。
    它的又一个特点，就是劳力统一调配，并且实行比较细致合理的分工，按每个人的专长分配工作。男女老少甚至身体衰弱和残废的人都能有合适的活干。因为分工比较细致了，也就能够注意改进技术；因为劳动效率提高了，也就能够经营较多的有利农业生产发展的副业，能使社员更多增加收入。
    它的又一个特点，就是积累了较多的公共财产，使用了比较大的新式农具，能较多地增加生产。
    统一使用土地和牲口农具，统一使用劳动力、一定的按劳分配、积累公共财产，这些就是农业生产合作社里的社会主义成分。土地和一些农具、牲口还是私有的，还要分一定的报酬，这就不是社会主义的办法。说它是半社会主义性质的，道理就在这里。
    目的——发展农业生产，大
        家共同富裕
    农业生产合作社要经营一些什么事业？
    它既然是劳动人民的生产组织，又是半社会主义性质的，就应该把主要的力量用来发展农业生产，增加粮食、棉花和别的农作物的产量，支援国家工业建设，改善全体社员的生活。社里也可以经营对农业生产有帮助的各种副业，像林业、牧业、渔业、手工业等等；但是绝对不能经营商业（农业生产合作社要买卖东西，最好是通过供销合作社），也绝对不能放高利贷（农业生产合作社里一时用不着的钱，最好是存到国家银行里或者信用合作社里）。不论是经营农业、副业，都绝对不能雇长工。每个社员都不得雇长工入社，社里也不得雇进长工。这些都是剥削人的事，和农业生产合作社的性质是不相容的。办农业生产合作社就是走社会主义的路，目的是要全体劳动农民都富裕起来；不容许任何人钻进社里剥削别的社员们，农业生产合作社也决不剥削社外的任何一个人。不过，因为社里缺乏有技术的人，请社外的人做技术工，社里缺少会算账记账的人，请社外的人做会计，给人家合理的薪金，那是可以的；农忙时为了赶时间雇少量的短工，也是允许的。
      成员——只有劳动农民才能
        参加
    什么人可以参加农业生产合作社？
    一定要是劳动农民才能参加。一定年龄（譬如东北、华北都规定为十六岁）以上的劳动农民，不论是男是女，只要自愿遵守社里的规矩制度，按照自己的能力参加社内一定的劳动（管理社里的事情、当会计，也算劳动，那叫做脑力劳动），经社员大会通过，就可以入社。反革命分子、没有改变成分的地主、富农、商人，都不得入社。为什么呢？因为农业生产合作社既是劳动农民的半社会主义性质的组织，就不能允许剥削者和反革命分子参加进来。允许他们参加进来，实际上就是允许他们混进来进行剥削和捣乱，妨碍大家在社会主义的道路上一步一步前进；甚至会把合作社弄得变了性质，变成剥削和欺压劳动人民的组织，不再是半社会主义性质的合作社了。已经经过劳动改造解除了管制的原反革命分子、已经改变了成分的地主和富农、已经放弃商业活动参加农业劳动一定时间改变了成分的商人，是不是可以入社呢？这可以由社员大会讨论决定。这些人即便大家允许他们入了社，也不可让他们做领导人，也还要一方面继续对他们加强教育，一方面防备他们进行破坏活动。
    社员入社是自愿的，决不强迫；退社是自由的，决不强留。任何人入社以后，觉得不合自己的心，都可以退社。退社的时候还把他本人的土地、农具、牲口和别的生产投资退还给他。如果土地入社以后大家加了工，改良了土质或者兴修了水利，应当由退社的人给社里一定的报酬。总之，既不能叫退社的人吃亏，也不能叫社里大伙吃亏。事实上，只要社办得好，要退社的人是很少的。
      组织——实行民主集中制
    社里的事情由什么人来管？
    农业生产合作社既然是劳动农民自己的生产组织，社里的事就应当是由全体社员大家来管。大家管，也不是说要许多人都来“乱当家”。人人“乱当家”，大伙的事就办不好了。既然是个组织，就要按一定的组织原则办事。农业生产合作社按什么组织原则办事呢？就是民主集中制。就是说：又要大家当家，又要不“乱当家”。重大的事情，要开社员大会来决定；比较大的社，也可以开社员代表大会来决定（代表也是大家选举出来的）。全体社员大会或者社员代表大会要管的事情是：选举正副主任（就是社长）、管理委员会（也有的叫理事会）和监察委员会（较小的社可以不设监察委员会，由社员直接监督），讨论和批准全社的生产计划、财务计划，讨论和决定公积金、公益金每年留多少和怎样使用，讨论和决定劳动日怎样计算、收益怎样分配，通过新社员入社，决定对社员的奖赏和处分，讨论别的重大的事情。
    社里日常的事情，是由大家选出来的管理委员会来管理的。管理委员会在主任的领导下，根据社员大会或社员代表大会的决议办事。社里的日常工作，都由管理委员会负责安排。
    监察委员会要管的事情是：监督管理委员会是不是执行了社员大会或社员代表大会的决议，对不尽责任的做错了社里的事的人员提出处理意见，监督社里的财务管理，以免发生贪污浪费的事情，也要监督社员们都按大家讨论决定的规矩、制度办事。
    社里可以按生产的实际需要，把社员组织成几个生产队或者生产组，每个队或组选出正副队长或组长，在管理委员会领导下进行生产劳动。管理委员会把社里要做的事情分配到各个队或组，队长或组长再把这些事情按各人的专长分配给每个人，并且领着大伙一起干。
    入社以后是不是就得受别人管，就没有个人的自由了？社里当然要有一定的规矩、制度，大家都要照着规矩、制度办事。如果大家都是自己想干什么就干什么，想用社里的什么东西就随便用，社就会垮台。大家既然要入社或者已经入了社，就是决心要把社办好，决不会愿意把社办垮，自然就会愿意遵守这些规矩、制度。这些规矩、制度也不是由那一个人或者少数人定出来硬要大家照办的，是根据需要经过社员大会民主讨论定出来的。
    前途——一步步走到社会主
        义性质的农业生产合作社
    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，不过是往社会主义走的路上的一段，要达到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，还是需要走相当长的时间的。
    有人说，既然社会主义好，为什么不马上办完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（集体农庄）呢？要知道，完全社会主义的农业生产合作社，就是土地、大农具、耕畜都归全体社员伙有，用新技术进行大规模的生产，完全按劳动的多少、好坏分配农业和副业产品。那样好是好，可是一般地说眼下还很难办到。因为，只有生产提高得相当多了，土地不分红也比没有入社的时候收入多了，大家的觉悟也都提高了，才可能都赞成土地不分红，也才可能积累更多的公共财产，用新农具新技术进行更大规模的生产。现在，一方面，绝大多数农民一时还很难把多少辈子以来依靠私有土地过日子的思想和习惯改掉；一方面，我们的农业技术还很落后，也很缺乏管理大规模的农业生产的经验和骨干。这些习惯、经验、骨干、技术，都可以从半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社里得到。
    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社不是一成不变的。它是走到完全社会主义的过渡形式；是不断变化的。它的规模要从较小到较大，它的制度要从较简单到较复杂，它的劳力分红的比例要随着生产的发展和群众的觉悟逐步提高，它的公共财产的积累要从较少到较多；集体经营的习惯、经验、骨干、技术也一年比一年更好更成熟，产量和大家的收入也一年比一年更丰富。到了最后，就可以走到更幸福更美满的社会主义了。
    从互助组到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，就像我们种的果树一样，先有一点社会主义的嫩芽，芽子渐渐出土成苗，渐渐长成有枝有叶的小树，渐渐长成开花结果的大树，我们就能吃到越来越多的又香又甜的果子了。
