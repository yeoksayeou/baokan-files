Changning Cracks Down on Counter-Revolutionaries Sabotaging National Grain Procurement

Principal Offenders Li Longjia and Two Others Sentenced to Death, Other Offenders Sentenced to Imprisonment

A case of remaining counter-revolutionaries colluding with unscrupulous merchants to抢购 (qiǎng gòu - rush to purchase) grain and systematically sabotage national grain procurement work has been cracked in Changning County, Hunan Province. Last September, immediately following the autumn harvest, a serious grain shortage suddenly occurred in the Fifth District of Changning County. The masses could not buy rice. The state grain purchasing stations in Baisha Town and Yangjiazhou had only purchased over 7,000 catties of rice from the beginning of the purchase to September. Finally, it was impossible to purchase any grain at all. Based on this abnormal situation, the Public Security Bureau of the County People's Government conducted in-depth investigations among the masses and thoroughly clarified the facts of the remaining counter-revolutionaries colluding with unscrupulous merchants to carry out sabotage activities. The entire case was solved, and all nine principal offenders were arrested.

The principal offender Li Longjia was from Yangjia Township, Fifth District of Changning County. The principal offenders Wen Yangsen, Wen Yangyan, Wen Yangxin, Wen Yangsan, Wu Daichun, and Wen Yijin were all from Jiaoyuan Township, Fifth District of Changning County. During the Kuomintang rule, most of them served as pseudo-chiefs or Jia chiefs. Relying on their power, they colluded with landlords and despots, ran rampant in the local area, conscripted soldiers and extorted money, causing many peasants to lose their families and fortunes. After liberation, they remained unrepentant and continued to carry out sabotage activities. For example, on the evening of December 14, 1949, Li Longjia used the organizational foundation of the reactionary sectarian "Puhua Wentan" to hold a secret meeting with more than 20 former landlords and despots, organizing the reactionary "Mid-Autumn Festival Association," drinking red flower blood wine to swear allegiance and carry out activities. In 1950, he also joined the counter-revolutionary organization "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," accepting orders from the bandit leader to infiltrate the township people's government as a secretary, issuing road passes to bandits and secret agents, and helping the bandit leader with activities and communication. On Labor Day in 1951, he boldly posted reactionary slogans. Wen Yangsen, Wen Yangyan, Wen Yangsan, Wen Yangxin, Wen Yijin, and others also joined the "Jingcheng Column of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" in the first month of 1950, taking turns providing for and shielding the bandit leader's counter-revolutionary activities. The other two principal offenders, Jiang Xianjie and Long Shuzhang, were unscrupulous merchants in Yangjiazhou, Changning County, who consistently engaged in speculative activities. In 1950, Jiang Xianjie even colluded with former despotic landlords to convene a secret meeting of 30 backward masses, similarly drinking red flower blood wine to swear allegiance and attempt to carry out sabotage activities. When some counter-revolutionary organizations of bandits and secret agents were successively cracked down upon and the bandit leaders were suppressed, these remaining counter-revolutionaries turned to more covert activities. Li Longjia used the remaining forces of the reactionary organization to open the "Hengsheng Native Produce Firm," posing as the manager. In addition to concealing funds and evading a large amount of taxes, he also partnered with Wen Yangsen, Wen Yangyan, and other criminals to sell native product 白芍 (bái sháo - white peony root), accumulating capital for counter-revolutionary activities. Wen Yangsen and others had successively used money to buy off cadres and masses in Jiaoyuan Township. In July and August of this year, they gave more than 3.8 million yuan to the township government to openly make ten machetes, seventy spears, repair forty Mauser rifles, and make one hundred and thirty hats for the militia team, attempting to launch a riot. They also distributed money to cadres and some of the masses to win them over, and then used "honey traps" to drag the township public security officer into the water, so that they could carry out large-scale sabotage operations. After these remaining counter-revolutionaries made these arrangements, they first targeted the country's grain purchasing work, to carry out sabotage. In addition to pre-purchasing more than 140 piculs of new grain from farmers at a low price of 32,000 yuan or 45,000 yuan per shi when farmers were short of food between June and July last year, after the autumn harvest, they also colluded with unscrupulous merchants such as Jiang Xianjie and Long Shuzhang to massively抢购 (qiǎng gòu - rush to purchase) and 套购 (tào gòu - purchase through improper relationships) grain, and raise grain prices, manipulating the entire grain trading market in the Fifth District of Changning County. The government's listed price was 12,000 yuan per dou, but they抢购 (qiǎng gòu - rush to purchase) at a high price of 17,000 yuan per dou, and purchased all grains regardless of quality, even shouting the "three no-fear" slogans of "not afraid of expensive, not afraid of rotten, not afraid of far." They also impersonated government cadres, ran to various villages to fraudulently purchase grain from the masses, openly telling the masses: "We are sent by the People's Government to purchase grain, preparing to sell it to the farmers next year during the famine." In addition, they widely used various social relations to penetrate into villages to purchase grain from farmers, using the method of relatives and friends stringing together other relatives and friends. In this way, they successively抢购 (qiǎng gòu - rush to purchase) more than 1,000 piculs of rice in various townships in the Fifth District of Changning County and Guiyang, Hengyang, Jiahe, Leiyang, and other places. They also used small favors to win over farmers who sold grain, and cunning methods such as keeping each other secret, to cover up these behaviors of sabotaging the state's grain purchasing work, and even asked the militia they had bought to stand guard for them at night. The criminal Wen Yangsen even openly clamored: "If the cadres come to my village, they must die." Under the influence of the large-scale抢购 (qiǎng gòu - rush to purchase) of grain by these remaining counter-revolutionaries, unscrupulous merchants and peddlers in the Fifth District of Changning County also rushed to purchase and 套购 (tào gòu - purchase through improper relationships) grain, so the grain trading market was very tense, seriously harming the people's lives and affecting the smooth completion of the state's grain purchasing work. When the People's Government began to rectify the grain market, these remaining counter-revolutionaries boldly incited backward masses to make trouble. The criminal Li Longjia even instructed bad elements to beat district cadres. The destructive actions of these remaining counter-revolutionaries and unscrupulous merchants aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people in Changning County. After investigating and understanding the above situation, the Public Security Bureau of the County People's Government arrested the nine principal offenders, including Li Longjia, and transferred them to the County People's Court for trial.

After verifying the crimes of each criminal, the Changning County People's Court convened a public trial attended by more than 12,000 people on December 3rd of last year, sentencing Li Longjia, Wen Yangsen, and Wen Yangyan to death on the spot, and with the approval of the Provincial People's Government, they were immediately executed by firing squad; Jiang Xianjie was sentenced to life imprisonment. All the property of these four criminals, except for a portion left to their families for living expenses, was confiscated. The other criminals were also sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes. This just verdict was warmly supported by the broad masses. The farmer Huang Shucao reported on the spot that the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Shuyi had fraudulently purchased 300 catties of his rice and 套购 (tào gòu - purchase through improper relationships) more than 80 piculs of grain. The farmer Liu Jiefang also reported on the spot the crime of the pharmacist Peng Shengcheng who 套购 (tào gòu - purchase through improper relationships) more than 8,000 catties of grain. By participating in this public trial, the broad masses further recognized the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state, and expressed their willingness to sell surplus grain to the state. On the spot, more than 20 farmers volunteered to sell a total of 8,500 catties of surplus grain to the state at the meeting.

    常宁破获反革命分子破坏国家购粮工作案
    主犯李隆家等三名被判处死刑其他各犯被分别判处徒刑
    湖南省常宁县破获了一件残余的反革命分子勾结奸商结伙抢购粮食，有计划地破坏国家购粮工作的案件。去年九月间，正当秋收以后，常宁县第五区突然发生严重缺粮现象，群众买不到米吃，白沙镇和阳嘉州的国家粮食收购站从开始收购到九月份止，一个多月时间只收购了七千多斤稻谷，最后根本收购不到粮食了。县人民政府公安局根据这一反常情况，深入群众进行侦查，彻底查清了残余的反革命分子勾结奸商进行破坏活动的事实，全部破案，将九名主犯全部逮捕。
    主犯李隆家是常宁县五区阳嘉乡人，主犯文仰森、文仰焱、文仰鑫、文仰三、吴代春、文仪进等六人都是常宁县五区茭源乡人。他们在国民党统治时期，大部分当过伪保长或甲长，依仗势力，勾结地主恶霸，横行地方，抓兵诈财，害得许多农民倾家败产。解放后，他们仍执迷不悟，继续进行破坏活动。如李隆家在一九四九年十二月十四日晚，曾利用反动会道门“普化文坛”的组织基础，与过去的地主恶霸二十多人开秘密会议，组织反动的“中秋会”，吃红花血酒发誓，进行活动。一九五○年他又参加反革命组织“反共救国军”，接受匪首命令，打入乡人民政府当秘书，给土匪、特务开路条，帮助匪首活动和联络。一九五一年劳动节时，他竟大胆张贴反动标语。又文仰森、文仰焱、文仰三、文仰鑫，文仪进等也在一九五○年正月，参加“反共救国军竟成纵队”，曾轮流供养并掩护匪首进行反革命活动。另两名主犯蒋贤诘、龙述章则是在常宁县阳嘉州一贯进行投机活动的不法奸商。蒋贤诘在一九五○年并曾勾结过去的恶霸地主，召集三十名落后群众开秘密会议，同样吃红花血酒发誓订盟，企图进行破坏活动。当一些土匪特务的反革命组织先后被破获，匪首被镇压后，这些残余的反革命分子即转入更隐蔽的活动。李隆家利用反动组织的残余势力，开设“恒盛土产行”，自充经理，除隐瞒资金，大量偷税漏税外，并伙同文仰森、文仰焱及其他各犯，销售土产白芍，积累进行反革命活动的本钱。文仰森等曾陆续用金钱收买茭源乡政府的干部和群众。今年七八月间，又拿三百八十多万元交由乡政府公开给民兵队打制马刀十把、梭标七十支，修马枪四十支，做帽子一百三十顶，企图暴动。又以金钱分送给干部及部分群众，进行拉拢收买，以后又用“美人计”拉乡公安员下水，以便于他们进行大规模的破坏行动。这些残余的反革命分子作了这些布置后，首先就针对国家的购粮工作，进行破坏。他们除在去年六七月间趁农民青黄不接之际，以每石三万二千元或四万五千元的贱价向农民预购新谷一百四十多石外，在秋收后，又勾结奸商蒋贤诘、龙述章等大规模地抢购、套购粮食，抬高粮价，操纵了整个常宁县五区的粮食交易市场。政府牌价每斗一万二千元，他们则以每斗一万七千元的高价抢购，而且不分粮食好坏一律购买，甚至喊出“不怕贵、不怕烂、不怕远”的三不怕口号。他们还冒充政府干部，分别跑乡村，骗购群众的粮食，公开对群众说：“我们是人民政府派来收购粮食的，准备明年渡荒时卖给农民。”此外，他们又以亲朋串亲朋的方式，广泛利用各种社会关系，深入乡村，收购农民的粮食。就这样他们先后在常宁县五区各乡及桂阳、衡阳、嘉禾、耒阳等地抢购稻谷一千多石。他们还用小恩小惠拉拢售谷农民，互相保密等狡猾手段，掩盖这些破坏国家购粮工作的行为，甚至还叫被他们收买的民兵在夜间替他们站岗放哨。文犯仰森竟公开叫嚣：“如果干部到我村来，就要他们死命。”在这些残余的反革命分子大量抢购粮食的影响下，常宁县五区的奸商和小贩也纷纷抢购和套购粮食，因此粮食交易市场上出现了非常紧张状态，严重地危害了人民生活，影响了国家购粮工作的顺利完成。当人民政府开始整顿粮食市场时，这些残余的反革命分子又大胆地煽动落后群众，进行扰乱，李犯隆家竟指使坏分子殴打区干部。这些残余反革命分子和奸商的破坏行动，激起了常宁县广大人民的愤怒。县人民政府公安局经过调查，了解以上情况后，即将李隆家等九名主犯逮捕、并移送县人民法院审理。
    常宁县人民法院把各犯犯罪情节审实后，即于去年十二月三日召开了有群众一万二千多人参加的公审大会，当场判处李隆家、文仰森、文仰焱三犯死刑，并经省人民政府批准，立即执行枪决；判处蒋贤诘无期徒刑。并没收这四犯的除留给家属生活的一部分以外的全部财产。对其他各犯也按其犯罪情节轻重分别判处徒刑。这一公正的判决，得到广大群众的热烈拥护。农民黄书曹当场检举了奸商张书一骗购他三百斤稻谷和套购粮食八十多石的事实。农民刘洁芳也当场检举了药商彭生诚套购粮食八千多斤的罪行。广大群众通过参加这次公审大会，进一步认识了把余粮卖给国家的好处，纷纷表示要把余粮卖给国家，当场就有二十多个农民在大会上自报把余粮共八千五百斤卖给国家。
