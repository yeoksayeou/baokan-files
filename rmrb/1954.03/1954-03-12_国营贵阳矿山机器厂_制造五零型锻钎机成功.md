    State-Owned Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory
    Successfully Manufactures Model 50 Forging Drill Machine
    Workers at the state-owned Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory have successfully manufactured China's first Model 50 forging drill machine. After thorough factory appraisal and test runs, it has been proven that the machine's quality and the forged product – steel drills – both meet standards.
    The Model 50 forging drill machine is a working machine tool that uses compressed air as power and is specifically designed for manufacturing steel drills. Steel drills are a necessary tool for drilling rocks and are indispensable for opening mountains for mining, building railways, and constructing water conservancy projects. The Model 50 forging drill machine is a relatively precise and complex working machine tool, but through the efforts of the workers at the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, various difficulties were overcome, and it was finally successfully manufactured. To celebrate the birth of this new product, the factory held a grand official test run celebration on February 17th.

    国营贵阳矿山机器厂
    制造五零型锻钎机成功
    国营贵阳矿山机器厂职工制造我国第一台五零型锻钎机成功。经过厂内周密的鉴定和试车，证明机器的质量和锻压出来的成品——钢钎，都合乎标准。
    五零型锻钎机是利用压缩空气为动力来专门制造钢钎的一种工作母机。钢钎是用来钻凿岩石的一种必需工具，无论开山采矿、修铁路以及兴建水利工程等都不能缺少它。五零型锻钎机是一种比较精密比较复杂的工作母机，但经贵阳矿山机器厂职工们的努力，克服了各种困难，终于制造成功。为了庆祝这一新产品的诞生，该厂曾于二月十七日举行了隆重的正式试车庆祝大会。　（倪紫冲）
