    慰问团代表深入内蒙古各地慰问解放军
    据新华社讯：全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团第六总分团和所属第四分团的代表，深入内蒙古自治区各地慰问人民解放军。

    慰问团代表们从二月二十六日到三月十日止，在乌兰浩特等地慰问了在冰天雪地中保卫祖国边防、铁道运输和森林的人民解放军。并向解放军报告了党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务及祖国四年来经济建设的伟大成就。全国著名的牧业劳动模范胡和勒泰向解放军说：我们牧民永远爱戴着解放军，甚至在安顿孩子们睡觉时，都用“解放军叔叔在保卫着你”这句话来安慰孩子。

    慰问团代表还分别在锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟和大兴安岭林区等地进行深入慰问。在内蒙古自治区西部，慰问团代表慰问了曾两次在国庆节接受毛主席检阅的人民解放军某骑兵部队的指挥员、战斗员。当慰问团代表到达该部时，这支在解放战争中立下了丰功伟绩的蒙族骑兵部队以蒙古民族最崇敬的仪式——“嘎勒奥克特吐勒”（营火敬酒）及骑兵的最高礼节——马刀礼迎接了毛主席和全国人民派来的使者。他们还热情地请慰问团代表参观了他们的展览会和马术表演。在寒冷的内蒙古自治区东部，慰问团代表慰问了驻守在呼伦贝尔草原、大兴安岭林区和西辽河两岸的战士。

    慰问团代表还慰问了正在执行黄河防凌任务的某炮兵部队和各部队的学校、医院、疗养院等。慰问团代表并深入到部队的厨房、马厩和哨位上去向正在分散执勤的战士进行慰问。

Representatives of the慰问(comforting) Delegation Go Deep into Inner Mongolia to Comfort the People's Liberation Army
According to Xinhua News Agency: Representatives of the Sixth General Sub-Delegation and its Fourth Sub-Delegation of the National People's Comfort Delegation to the People's Liberation Army went deep into various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to comfort the People's Liberation Army.

From February 26th to March 10th, the delegation representatives visited the People's Liberation Army in Ulanhot and other places who were defending the motherland's border, railway transportation, and forests in the icy and snowy weather. They also reported to the People's Liberation Army the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, as well as the great achievements of the motherland's economic construction in the past four years. Huhelete, a nationally renowned model worker in animal husbandry, said to the People's Liberation Army: We herdsmen will always love the People's Liberation Army. Even when settling our children to sleep, we use the words "Uncle PLA is protecting you" to comfort them.

The delegation representatives also conducted in-depth visits in Xilin Gol League, Chahar League, and the Greater Khingan Range forest area. In the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the delegation representatives visited the commanders and fighters of a cavalry unit of the People's Liberation Army that had twice been reviewed by Chairman Mao on National Day. When the delegation representatives arrived at the unit, this Mongolian cavalry unit, which had made great achievements in the Liberation War, greeted the envoys sent by Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country with the most respected ceremony of the Mongolian people - "Gala Okete Tule" (bonfire toasting) and the highest etiquette of the cavalry - saber salute. They also warmly invited the delegation representatives to visit their exhibition and equestrian performance. In the cold eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the delegation representatives visited the soldiers stationed in the Hulunbuir Grassland, the Greater Khingan Range forest area, and along the banks of the Xiliao River.

The delegation representatives also visited an artillery unit performing the task of preventing ice jams on the Yellow River, as well as the schools, hospitals, and sanatoriums of various units. The delegation representatives also went deep into the kitchens, stables, and outposts of the troops to visit the soldiers who were on dispersed duty.
