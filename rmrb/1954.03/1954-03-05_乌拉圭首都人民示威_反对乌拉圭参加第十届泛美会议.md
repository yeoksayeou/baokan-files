Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, February 28th, TASS: The working people of the Uruguayan capital held a massive demonstration in Montevideo. The demonstration was organized by the Communist Party. The slogans of the march were: "Strive for peace, oppose the Tenth Pan-American Conference, oppose high prices, strive for higher wages, and support Communist Party General Secretary Eugenio Gómez as a candidate for parliament in the November elections."

After the march, a mass meeting was held, at which Eugenio Gómez spoke. He denounced the policy of subjugation to American monopoly capital, the policy of hunger, poverty, and rising prices being implemented in the country. He called on the people to unite and fight for peace, bread, democracy, and national independence.

The congress passed a resolution opposing Uruguay's participation in the Tenth Pan-American Conference, expressing solidarity with the people of Guatemala, and demanding the immediate release from prison of Paraguayan democratic activist Obdulio Barthe, Venezuelan labor leader Jesús Faría, and a group of Spanish patriots led by López Raimundo.
