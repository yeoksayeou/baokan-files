    Soviet Government Note to the Greek Government
    Points out that the US-Greek Military Agreement Violates Interests of Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 22] TASS, Moscow, March 22nd: Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, V.A. Zorin, presented a note to Greek Ambassador to Moscow, Contoumas, on March 20th. The note once again protested the agreement signed between Greece and the United States on October 12, 1953, regarding the construction of American military bases on Greek territory and the use of railways and highways on Greek territory, in accordance with the plans of the North Atlantic Group, as a violation of the interests of maintaining peace. The note pointed out that this shows that the Greek government has begun to implement measures aimed at preparing for another war.
    The note listed some materials to confirm this, stating: Large-scale military exercises with the participation of foreign armed forces have been held on Greek territory; representatives of the US military command have inspected Greece; large numbers of US warships frequently visit Greek ports; and US weapons provided to Greece have increased; the work of the United States to build military bases on Greek territory has been accelerated. The United States is stepping up the construction of a naval and air base on Crete, and is about to build the main base for bombers and reconnaissance aircraft on the Greek islands along the Crete-Lemos-Dardanelles line in the Aegean Sea. Naval and air bases are also being built on the Aegean Islands (Rhodes, Karpathos, Kassos, etc.), while according to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, these islands must be demilitarized.
    Based on the above facts, the note refuted the Greek government's statement in the note of November 10, 1953, that the US-Greek agreement stemmed from the desire to ensure Greek security, as contradicting the facts.
    The note emphasized that the Soviet government has consistently and unswervingly pursued a policy of peace and development of international cooperation, and pointed out that the Balkan countries—whose relations with Greece have not yet been fully normalized—have also expressed their willingness to normalize their relations with Greece in order to consolidate peace in the Balkans.
    The note concluded by saying that based on the above facts, it can be clearly seen that the conclusion of the US-Greek military agreement has created obstacles to the consolidation of peace in the Balkans. Therefore, the Soviet government once again urges the Greek government to pay attention to the consequences caused by the implementation of the above-mentioned measures, the responsibility for which must be borne entirely by the Greek government.

### 苏联政府照会希腊政府  指出希美军事协定违反和平利益

    苏联政府照会希腊政府
    指出希美军事协定违反和平利益
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：苏联外交部副部长瓦·亚·佐林三月二十日以照会一件交给希腊驻莫斯科大使康陶马斯。照会再次抗议希腊与美国一九五三年十月十二日签订的关于按照北大西洋集团的计划，在希腊领土上建筑美国军事基地并使用希腊领土上的铁路与公路的协定，是违反维持和平的利益的。照会指出：这说明希腊政府已开始执行目的在于准备另一次战争的措施。
    照会列举了一些材料证实这一点说：在希腊领土上举行了有外国武装部队参加的大规模的军事演习；美国军事司令部的代表在希腊视察；大队美国军舰经常访问希腊的海港；而且美国给予希腊的武器增加了；美国在希腊领土上建筑军事基地的工作加紧了。美国正加紧在克里特岛上建筑一个海空军基地，而且就要在爱琴海中克里特岛—棱诺斯岛—达达尼尔峡这一条线沿线的希腊岛屿上建筑轰炸机与侦察机的主要基地。在爱琴海的岛屿（罗得岛、卡奇岛、卡索斯岛等）上也在建筑海空军基地，而根据对意和约，这些岛屿是必须非军事化的。
    照会根据以上事实，驳斥希腊政府在一九五三年十一月十日的照会中说希美协定是出于保障希腊安全的愿望的说法是与事实矛盾的。
    照会强调说明苏联政府始终如一地坚持不渝地奉行着和平与发展国际合作的政策，并指出巴尔干国家——它们与希腊的关系仍然没有完全正常化——也表示愿意使它们与希腊的关系正常化，以有利于巩固巴尔干的和平。
    照会最后说，根据以上事实，可以明显看出希美军事协定的缔结为巴尔干和平的巩固制造了障碍。因此，苏联政府再次促请希腊政府注意：执行上述措施所引起的后果，责任完全要由希腊政府来担负。
