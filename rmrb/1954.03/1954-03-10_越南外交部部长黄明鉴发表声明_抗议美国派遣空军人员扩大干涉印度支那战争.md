Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 9th: The following is the full text of a statement issued by Huang Mingjian, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, protesting the United States' dispatch of Air Force personnel to expand intervention in the Indochina War:

	As early as June 27, 1950, US President Truman publicly declared that he would accelerate military assistance to the French aggressor troops in Indochina and dispatch military missions to intensify intervention in the Indochina War. For several years, American imperialism has continuously helped the French colonialists financially and with weapons to carry out this bloody war, which not only harms the interests of the people of Indochina, but also harms the interests of the French people. Recently, after the French colonialist Navarre's aggressive plan suffered a disastrous defeat due to the heroic counterattack of the brave people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the US government, disregarding everything, ruthlessly and publicly dispatched US Air Force personnel to Indochina in February 1954 to directly participate in the massacre of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. For this reason, on behalf of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, I lodge a serious protest with the US government.
	At the same time, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam cannot but point out to the peace-loving people of the United States and the peace-loving people of the world the seriousness of the US government's dispatch of Air Force personnel to participate in the Indochina War. We believe that at a time when the people of the world are making unremitting efforts to maintain peace and ease the overall international tension, and when the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference has already suggested that representatives of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as other relevant countries, convene a meeting in Geneva to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the US government's blatant dispatch of a large number of Air Force personnel to participate in the Indochina War is certainly not for the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, but to expand intervention in the Indochina War. It can be seen that the US government's recent move to dispatch a large number of Air Force personnel to participate in the Indochina War not only directly violates the independence and freedom of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, but is bound to further threaten peace in Asia and the world.
	President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out in his reply to Mr. Niger, editor of the Swedish Stockholm "Expressen", on November 26, 1953: "The Vietnam War was imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French government. The Vietnamese people were forced to take up arms, resist the aggressors, and fight heroically for seven or eight years to defend national independence and the freedom of peaceful life. Now, if the French colonialists continue their war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out their patriotic struggle to the final victory. However, if the French government has learned a lesson from more than seven years of war and is willing to negotiate to achieve a truce and resolve the Vietnam issue, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to accept this proposal from France."
	I am ordered by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to reaffirm that President Ho Chi Minh's speech on November 26, 1953, is the basic policy of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for resolving the current Indochina issue. No matter how the American aggressors and the colonialists in the French government collude to carry out the sinister conspiracy to intensify the Indochina War, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos will resolutely fight for the realization of national independence, democracy, freedom, and the defense of peace in Asia and the world. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fully support the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference's proposal to convene a Geneva conference on April 26, 1954, and are willing to fight to the end to restore the peaceful life of the people of Indochina.
	Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, closely united with the people of Cambodia and Laos, resolutely oppose the US government's move to dispatch a large number of Air Force personnel to participate in the Indochina War, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the American aggressors and French colonialists to intensify the Indochina War. We firmly believe that thanks to the close unity and heroic struggle of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and thanks to the active support of the peace-loving people of the world, our great struggle for national independence, democracy, and freedom will surely win the final victory.

    越南外交部部长黄明鉴发表声明
    抗议美国派遣空军人员扩大干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社北越九日讯：越南民主共和国外交部长黄明鉴抗议美国派遣空军人员扩大干涉印度支那战争的声明。全文如下：
    远在一九五○年六月二十七日，美国总统杜鲁门就公开声明要加速以军事援助供给在印度支那的法国侵略部队及派遣军事使团来加紧干涉印度支那战争。几年来，美帝国主义即不断地从财政和武器方面帮助法国殖民主义者来进行这个不但危害印度支那人民的利益，同样也危害法国人民的利益的血腥战争。最近由于法国殖民主义者纳瓦尔的侵略计划遭受到英勇的越南、高棉、寮国人民的英勇反击以致惨败后，美国政府更不顾一切于一九五四年二月间冷酷地、公开地派遣美国空军人员前来印度支那直接参加屠杀越南、高棉、寮国人民。为此，我特代表越南民主共和国政府和人民，向美国政府提出严重的抗议。
    同时，越南民主共和国的人民和政府不能不向美国爱好和平的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民指出美国政府派遣空军人员参加印度支那战争这一问题的严重性。我们认为，当全世界人民正在为维护和平及缓和整个国际紧张局势而进行不懈斗争的时候，当柏林四国外长会议业已建议苏、中、美、英、法五国及其他有关国家代表在日内瓦召开会议讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题的时候，美国政府竟公然派遣大批空军人员参加印度支那侵略战争，这种举动当然不是为了和平解决印度支那问题，而是为了扩大干涉印度支那战争。由此可见，美国政府最近派遣大批空军人员参加印度支那战争的举动，不但直接侵犯了越南、高棉、寮国三国人民的独立与自由，并且势必进一步威胁亚洲和世界的和平。
    越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席曾经在其一九五三年十一月二十六日答复瑞典斯德哥尔摩“快报”主编尼哥的谈话中指出：“越南战争是法国政府强加于越南人民身上的。越南人民是被迫拿起武器，反抗侵略者，为保卫民族独立与和平生活的自由而英勇奋斗了七八年。现在假如法国殖民主义者继续其侵略越南的战争，越南人民是有决心将自己的爱国斗争进行到最后胜利的。但是，假如法国政府因七年多的战争已得到教训，愿意经过谈判，获得停战并解决越南问题，越南民主共和国的人民和政府是愿意接受法国这项建议的。”
    我奉越南民主共和国政府之命重新声明，胡志明主席一九五三年十一月二十六日的谈话乃是越南民主共和国政府解决目前印度支那问题的基本政策。不管美国侵略者和法国政府中的殖民主义者怎样勾结起来，进行那种加紧印度支那战争的毒辣阴谋，越南、高棉、寮国三国人民仍将坚决为实现民族独立、民主、自由以及保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争。越南、高棉、寮国三国人民完全支持柏林四国外长会议关于在一九五四年四月二十六日召开日内瓦会议的建议，并愿为恢复印度支那人民的和平生活而奋斗到底。
    越南民主共和国政府和人民在胡志明主席领导下，与高棉、寮国两国人民紧密团结起来，坚决反对美国政府派遣大批空军人员参加印度支那战争的举动，坚决反对美国侵略者和法国殖民者加紧印度支那战争的阴谋。我们深信，由于越南、高棉、寮国三国人民紧密的团结和英勇斗争，由于全世界爱好和平人民的积极支援，我们争取民族独立、民主自由的伟大斗争一定能获得最后胜利。
