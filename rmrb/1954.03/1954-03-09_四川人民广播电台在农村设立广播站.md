    Sichuan Province's first rural wired broadcasting station has been established in Shiyangchang, Guan County, and has begun broadcasting. When broadcasting began in the evening, farmers who had been working hard all day sat in the courtyard or gathered at the mutual aid team to listen to domestic and international news broadcast from Beijing, as well as special talks broadcast to farmers by the Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station, Sichuan opera, and folk music. The farmers are very satisfied with the broadcasting stations set up for them by the People's Government.
    The advantages of wired broadcasting are that it costs less and has good results. The station established in Shiyangchang, Guan County, has already connected more than 300 loudspeakers, connecting the vast countryside. The Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station will continue to set up ten wired broadcasting stations in Wenjiang County, Suining County and other places.

    四川人民广播电台在农村设立广播站
    四川省第一个农村有线广播站已在灌县石羊场成立并开始播音。当晚间开始播音时，辛劳一天的农民就坐在院坝内或聚集到互助组听由北京播出的国内外新闻和四川人民广播电台对农民播送的专题讲话、川剧、民间音乐等。农民们对人民政府为他们设立的广播站都十分满意。
    有线广播的优点是花钱少，效果好。灌县石羊场设立的一个站已牵广播喇叭三百多只，联系着广大的乡村。四川人民广播电台将继续在温江县、遂宁县等地设立十个有线广播站。
