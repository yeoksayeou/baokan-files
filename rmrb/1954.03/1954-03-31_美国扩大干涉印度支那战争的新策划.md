    New Plans by the United States to Expand Intervention in the Indochina War
    Cui Qi
    Recently, more and more facts show that the U.S. ruling clique is stepping up its plans to continue and expand intervention in the Indochina War, and to obstruct the Geneva Conference from seeking a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks at a press conference on March 23 openly revealed this attitude.
    Dulles openly declared: "We see no reason to abandon the so-called Navarre Plan, which, in general, is a two-year plan: it is expected that in about a year from now, in the battle season after the current battle season, if not to achieve a complete victory, at least to achieve decisive military results." At the same time, he said that the United States would continue to provide France with military "aid" "very quickly and effectively" in the future. Dulles unabashedly declared that this U.S. policy of intervention in the Indochina War was "already determined."
    There is a reason why the U.S. Secretary of State is touting the bankrupt "Navarre Plan." Everyone knows that the "Navarre Plan" was originally stamped with the words "Made in the USA" and was a tool used by the U.S. ruling clique to interfere in the Indochina War. Now, with less than a month to go before the Geneva Conference, Dulles is clamoring about "achieving decisive military results" "a year later." This, apart from showing that the United States is trying to refuse to fulfill its obligations under the Berlin Conference agreement and deliberately undermining discussions at the Geneva Conference on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, is impossible to explain in any other way.
    Dulles's remarks were made in response to the talks between French Chief of Staff Ély and the U.S. government. The United States is clearly trying to plan further expansion of the Indochina War with the active intervention of the United States through this meeting. The French government's acceptance of Washington's orders to send its Chief of Staff to Washington shows that the French authorities are still trying to rely on "U.S. aid" to sustain the colonial war. The U.S. ruling clique is using this meeting to strengthen its pressure on France in order to further tie France to the Indochina battlefield and drive France to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. This practice of having others fight for the United States to maintain international tensions is precisely one of the main contents of the "new look" policy that the U.S. war-mongering clique is currently touting.
    In order to encourage France to fight in Indochina, the United States has mobilized its propaganda machine to distort the current situation of the Indochina War as much as possible, and to maintain France's "confidence" in continuing the war as if coaxing children. Dulles added to this propaganda in his speech on the 23rd, saying that, as far as he could see, France did not seem to have suffered any military setbacks and "will not have any" in the future. U.S. President Eisenhower, Defense Secretary Wilson, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford have also tried their best to encourage France to continue fighting, and promised that the United States would send a batch of bombers and transport planes to Indochina. United Press International (UPI) reported: "Radford is urging the planes to be sent quickly because he believes that the French will should not waver just before the Geneva peace conference."
    However, the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense cannot help but feel that making France continue the war, especially planning a strategy to win "victory," is a very troublesome problem. The Washington negotiators cannot help but feel extremely shocked by the current Dien Bien Phu campaign. The Dien Bien Phu campaign marks the increasing strength of the Vietnamese People's Army, which cannot be concealed by any U.S. propaganda machine.
    As a result, the U.S. ruling clique is increasingly eager to seize control of the Indochina War and force France to accept "additional assistance," that is, the United States "assists" France in training the Indochinese puppet army. U.S. interventionists are trying their best to prove to France that this is the only way to continue the Indochina War. But in fact, U.S. interventionists and French colonialists are equally discredited in the eyes of the Indochinese people. It is impossible for U.S. "training experts" to be more effective than French conscription in driving the Indochinese people in the French-occupied areas to "enthusiastically" act as cannon fodder for their enslavers. The U.S. ruling clique only wants to guarantee that the war will not end because France seeks an end based on its own interests and realistic considerations, and that the U.S. investment of tens of billions of dollars in the Indochina War will not be in vain by controlling the command of the puppet army.
    That is precisely why the United States has become impatient. A United Press International dispatch from Washington on March 24 stated: "Officials here bluntly asked France to state its attitude, whether it wants to accept this additional assistance." Radford and Wilson openly used arbitrary means to get Ély to accept the dispatch of a U.S. military training group to Indochina by the United States. They also stated that the appointment of U.S. Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel as the head of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina was to have him train the puppet army. Obviously, if France wants to continue to pay with life and blood in exchange for dollars, it will be difficult for it to stand up to the pressure of the United States. Although diplomatic figures in Paris and spokespersons for the French Embassy in Washington immediately denied that France had held any negotiations with the United States on the issue of training troops, according to United Press International, "Radford and Wilson are now very confident that Ély will persuade French Defense Minister Pleven to accept the U.S. proposal to improve the training of Vietnamese (puppet) troops."
    Reuters also revealed that the talks between the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon and Ély also discussed "political strategy issues" regarding Indochina. The U.S. ruling clique is trying to force France to adopt "a more closely aligned attitude with the United States on the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference." On March 28, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson openly threatened France not to make "concessions" to the people of Indochina at the Geneva Conference.
    This puts France in a situation: what are its plans for participating in the Geneva Conference: for the benefit of France or for the benefit of the United States? Is it to restore peace in Indochina or to continue the hopeless war? Now, some French ministers, while claiming that they are willing to restore peace in Indochina through negotiations, Ély's trip to Washington, even based on the publicly available results of the talks, is moving in the opposite direction of peaceful steps.
    The French ruling clique cannot turn a deaf ear to the calls of all social strata in its country for an end to the Indochina War. U.S. interventionists are also trying to conceal their conspiracy to induce France to continue the Indochina War and undermine the Geneva Conference. As a result, Dulles once again used the despicable tricks that people are accustomed to seeing in his speech on March 23, attempting to confuse the truth and slander the policy of peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue that the People's Republic of China has always adhered to. The U.S. Information Agency's report on March 24 also changed its tone, touting that one of Dulles's basic goals when going to the Geneva Conference was to "restore peace and security in Indochina," and vainly attempting to shift the responsibility for the United States' sabotage of peace in Asia and creation of tensions onto others. However, the U.S. ruling clique has done too many bad things, and the bad things it has said are no less than the beautiful words, and it is difficult to conceal them. Now it wants to do bad things with one hand, expanding the Indochina War and undermining the Geneva Conference, and playing the trick of "peace" and "consultation" with the other to deceive the people of the world, which is even more difficult to achieve.
    Today, peace-loving people all over the world are closely watching the upcoming Geneva Conference. Any activity that creates obstacles for the Geneva Conference cannot escape the eyes and ears of the people and will inevitably be severely condemned.

    美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的新策划
    崔奇
    最近，越来越多的事实表明，美国统治集团正在加紧策划继续和扩大干涉印度支那战争，阻挠日内瓦会议谋求印度支那问题的和平解决。美国国务卿杜勒斯三月二十三日在记者招待会上的谈话就露骨地表现了这种态度。
    杜勒斯公开宣布：“我们认为没有理由要放弃所谓纳瓦尔计划，概括地说，它是这样的一个两年计划：预计在从现在起大概一年后，在目前这个战斗季节之后的那个战斗季节中，即令不能获得全胜，至少也要取得决定性的军事结果。”同时他又说，美国今后将继续“非常迅速而有效地”给法国以军事“援助”。杜勒斯毫不掩饰地宣称，美国这种干涉印度支那战争的政策是“已经确定了的”。
    美国国务卿这样为破了产的“纳瓦尔计划”呐喊，不是没有原因的。谁都知道，“纳瓦尔计划”本来就是印着“美国制”的字样，是被美国统治集团用来干涉印度支那战争的工具。现在，在距离日内瓦会议开会日期不到一个月的时候，杜勒斯却大嚷“一年后”“取得决定性的军事结果”，这除了说明美国企图拒绝履行柏林会议协议的义务，蓄意要破坏在日内瓦会议上关于恢复印度支那和平问题的商谈以外，不可能有任何别的解释。
    杜勒斯的谈话是针对着法国总参谋长埃利和美国政府举行会谈而发的。美国显然是企图通过这次会谈，策划在美国的积极干涉下进一步扩大印度支那战争。法国政府接受华盛顿的命令，派遣它的总参谋长到华盛顿去，表明了法国当局还企图依靠“美援”把殖民战争支撑下去。而美国统治集团也就利用这次会谈来加强它对法国的压力，以便进一步把法国拴在印度支那战场上，驱使法国为美国火中取栗。这种假他人之手替美国作战以维持国际紧张局势的做法，恰恰是美国好战集团目前所大肆喧嚷的“新面貌”政策的主要内容之一。
    美国为了怂恿法国在印度支那作战，曾动员它的宣传机器极力歪曲印度支那战争的现势，像哄骗小孩子似地要法国保持继续作战的“信心”。杜勒斯在二十三日的谈话中又为这种宣传加了一把力，他说据他看来，法国现在似乎并没有什么军事失利，“将来也不会有”。美国总统艾森豪威尔、国防部长威尔逊、参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，也都极力为法国继续作战打气，并答应由美国增派一批轰炸机和运输机到印度支那。合众社称：“雷德福是催促快点把飞机送去的，因为他认为要使法国人的意志不致恰恰在日内瓦和平会议以前动摇。”
    但是，美国国务院和国防部不能不感到，要使法国继续进行战争，特别是要策划赢得“胜利”的战略，是一个十分麻烦的问题。华盛顿的会谈者对目前的奠边府战役都不能不感到极大的震动。奠边府战役标志着越南人民军的日益强大，这是美国任何宣传机器所无法掩盖的。
    于是，美国统治集团越来越想要夺取对印度支那战争的控制权，强迫法国接受一种“额外的援助”，即由美国“协助”法国训练印度支那傀儡军。美国干涉者竭力向法国证明只有这样才能把印度支那战争打下去。但事实上，美国干涉者和法国殖民者同样在印度支那人民面前声名狼藉，美国的“训练专家”决不可能比法国的强拉壮丁更能有效地驱使法国占领区的印度支那人民“热心”地为自己的奴役者作炮灰。美国统治集团只是想通过对傀儡军的指挥权，来保证这场战争不致因为法国根据自己的切身利益和现实的考虑而谋得结束，不致使美国投在印度支那战争中的数十亿美元的赌注落空。
    正是因为这样，美国已经急不可耐了。合众社三月二十四日华盛顿电讯称：“这里的官员直截了当地叫法国表明态度，它究竟是否想接受这项额外的援助”。雷德福和威尔逊就公开使用专横的手段要埃利接受由美国派一个军事训练团到印度支那。他们并表示任命美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔充当美国驻印度支那“军事援助顾问团”团长，就是要他去训练伪军。很显然，法国如果想要继续付出生命和鲜血去换取美元，它就很难在美国的压力面前挺起腰身。巴黎的外交界人士和法国驻华盛顿大使馆的发言人虽然立即否认法国曾和美国就训练军队问题作过任何谈判，但是，据合众社透露，“雷德福和威尔逊现在很有把握地认为埃利一定会劝法国国防部普利文接受美国关于改进越南（傀儡）部队训练工作的建议。”
    路透社又透露，美国国务院和五角大楼与埃利举行的会谈，还讨论了关于印度支那的“政治战略问题”。美国统治集团企图强迫法国采取与美国
  “在日内瓦会议上对印度支那问题的更为紧密一致的态度”。三月二十八日，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊又公开威胁法国不得在日内瓦会议上对印度支那人民“让步”。
    这就使法国面临着这样的局面，它究竟抱着什么打算去参加日内瓦会议：是为了法国的利益还是为了美国的利益？是为了恢复印度支那的和平还是为了继续无望的战争？现在法国的一些部长，虽然口口声声表示愿意通过谈判恢复印度支那的和平，但埃利到华盛顿去会谈，即使根据已经公开的会谈结果来说，也是与和平的步骤背道而驰的。
    法国统治集团是不能对它国内各社会阶层要求结束印度支那战争的呼声置若罔闻的。美国干涉者也力图掩盖它诱迫法国继续进行印度支那战争、破坏日内瓦会议的阴谋活动。于是，杜勒斯在三月二十三日的谈话中就再次使用了人们惯常看到的卑劣手法，企图蒙混事实的真相，诽谤中华人民共和国始终坚持的和平解决印度支那问题的政策。美国新闻处在三月二十四日的报道，也变换了调子，宣传什么杜勒斯在赴日内瓦会议时的基本目的之一是要“恢复印度支那的和平与安全”，并且枉费心机地企图把美国破坏亚洲和平、制造紧张局势的责任推到别人身上。然而，美国统治集团做的坏事太多了，说的坏话也不比漂亮话少，要掩饰是很困难的。现在它想一只手干着扩大印度支那战争、破坏日内瓦会议的坏事，另一只手耍着“和平”“协商”的花招，来欺蒙世界人民，更是难以奏效了。
    今天，全世界爱好和平的人民都在密切地注意着即将召开的日内瓦会议。任何为日内瓦会议制造障碍的活动，都不能逃避人民的耳目，都必然受到严厉的谴责。
