The silk satin dyed by the Zhejiang Silk Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Hangzhou City used to have only a few light colors of high quality. Dark-colored silk looked good when it was first dyed, but it would fade after being washed in hot water and soap. Many workers believed that silk fading was an unsolvable problem.

One day, the business section of the factory received a piece of colored silk shirt from a customer via the China Silk Company. The color of the collar of the shirt had faded, and one shirt had become two colors, which was very unsightly. The workers felt very sad when they saw this faded silk shirt. Wang Changming, a technician in the dyeing workshop, looked at the shirt carefully over and over again, thinking: "Consumers spend a lot of money and happily buy a silk dress to wear, but the color of the clothes changes after only a few days. This product came from our hands, how can we be worthy of them?" At this time, an idea came to his mind: "We should dye silk that doesn't fade, so that people can wear silk clothes that don't fade." So, under the leadership of the trade union, he and the workers in the dyeing workshop formed a "non-fading research group" to study how to improve the quality of dyeing.

Wang Changming and the workers went to other dyeing and weaving factories to humbly ask the master craftsmen for advice, and also found many reference books. At night, when everyone in the dormitory was asleep, Wang Changming was still concentrating on reading and looking for theoretical basis for dyeing and weaving; on holidays, when others were resting, he was still adjusting colors in the dispensing room.

The first research was on a kind of blue color. He experimented again and again, and failed again and again, but he was not discouraged at all, and still experimented patiently. After more than a dozen experiments, he finally got a result: once, the dyed silk did not fade after being washed in hot water and soap. However, the next day, when it was taken to the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Silk Company for careful inspection, it was found that although it did not fade, it affected the quality of the silk. This method still didn't work.

On the one hand, the silk must not fade, and on the other hand, the cost must be low, the method must be simple, and the quality of the silk must not be affected. There were indeed many difficulties. Encouraged by the secretary of the Party branch, Wang Changming plucked up the courage and continued to study with the master craftsmen of the research group, experimenting again and again, and learning from failures. Later, he found that to strengthen the fastness of dyeing without increasing costs, he should mainly focus on adjusting and fixing. In the past, the factory did not pay attention to adjustment, and simply boiled it with soap, so it was easy to fade. After discovering this problem, he and other workers carefully studied and changed to using chemical drugs such as "Ketonar" and "color fixing agent" to adjust. Soon, the two colors of "Zhang Lan" and "Jiao Yue" were finally successfully tested, and the dyeing quality was very good. This incident gave all the staff of the factory a profound education. Thanks to the active efforts of the employees of the "Non-Fading Research Group", the factory has now dyed nineteen colors of silk, including bright red, dark green, and frozen yellow, which have reached the standard of non-fading.

    浙江丝绸炼染厂染出多种不褪颜色的绸缎
    杭州市浙江丝绸炼染厂过去染出来的绸缎只有几种浅色的质量较高，深色的绸子在上色后开始光彩还很好，但一经热水和肥皂的浸洗，就会褪色。许多工人认为绸缎褪色是一个没有办法解决的问题。
    有一天，该厂业务科接到中国丝绸公司转来顾客的一件色绸衬衫，衬衫领口的颜色已经褪掉，一件衬衫变成了两种颜色，很不美观。工人们看到这个褪色的绸衬衣，心里十分难过。染色车间技术工人王长明，仔仔细细地把这件衬衫看了一遍又一遍，心里想：“消费者花了许多钱，高高兴兴地买一件绸衣裳穿，还没穿上几天，衣服的颜色就变成两样了。这是从我们手里出来的货色，怎么对得起他们呢？”这时候，他脑子里出现了一个念头：“我们应当染出不褪色的绸子来，让人们穿上不褪色的绸子衣服。”于是在工会的领导下他和染色车间的工人成立了一个“不褪色研究小组”，研究如何提高染色质量的问题。
    王长明和工人们一起跑到其他炼染厂去虚心地向老师傅们请教，并且找了好多参考书。夜里，宿舍里的人都睡了，王长明还在专心看书，找炼染的理论根据；假日别人都休息了，他还在配料间里调配颜色。
    第一次研究的是一种蓝颜色，他一次又一次地试验，一次又一次地遭到失败，但是他一点也没有灰心，仍旧耐心地试验，一连试验了十几次，终于得到了结果：有一次，染出来的绸子经过热水和肥皂的浸洗也不褪色了。可是，第二天拿到中国丝绸公司浙江省公司去仔细一检验，发现虽不褪色，却影响到绸子的质量。这个办法还是行不通。
    一方面要使绸子不褪色，另方面又必须照顾到成本低、做法简便、不影响绸子的质量。困难的确很多。王长明在党支部书记的鼓励下，鼓起勇气，和研究小组的老师傅们继续研究，又是一次一次地试验，从失败中吸取经验教训。后来他发现要在不增加成本的原则下加强染色的牢度，主要应当从调理固着方面着手。过去厂里不注意调理，只是简单地用肥皂煮一煮就算了，因此容易褪色。他发现这个问题后，就和其他工人细心研究，改用“克脱拿而”“固色剂”等化学药品来调理。不久，“丈蓝”和“皎月”两种颜色终于试验成功，染色质量很好。这件事情使全厂职工受到了一次深刻的教育。在“不褪色研究小组”的职工们的积极努力下，现在该厂染出的大红、墨绿、冻黄等十九种颜色的绸子，已经达到不褪色的标准了。
