Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – Nineteen foreign civilians were assisted by the Korean-Chinese side on the morning of the 1st to cross the military demarcation line and go to the American side. As they passed the Panmunjom bridge in two large trucks, they waved their hats to the Korean-Chinese personnel in greeting and farewell.

After these foreign civilians arrived in the American area, grim-faced American military police with pistols took them to the American reception station. These foreign civilians previously lived in Seoul, but the American side did not allow them to immediately return to Seoul to live as civilians. According to United Press, they will first be sent to Munsan for "physical examinations" and interviews by American journalists, and then sent to Daegu for "final processing" without a declared time limit.

These foreign civilians took all their personal belongings and household items with them when they left Kaesong. When they got into the car to leave, they thanked the doctors and nurses who had taken care of them.

The American side will hand over Korean civilians to the Korean-Chinese side on the 2nd. The American side had notified the Korean-Chinese side that the estimated number of civilians to be sent back was seventy. Later, the American side only agreed to send back thirty-eight people. On February 28, General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces, announced that he would detain two more of them and hand them over to the Syngman Rhee gang.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Command, approved the Syngman Rhee gang on February 28 to persecute and detain our displaced civilians who demanded to return to North Korea under the pretext of "espionage suspicion."

According to American news agencies, the Syngman Rhee gang had requested Hull a few days ago to allow them to "screen" the thirty-eight displaced civilians who had entered the American waiting camp awaiting repatriation on the grounds of "espionage suspicion," and to arrest two of them. After Hull agreed to this illegal request from the Rhee gang, the U.S. Korean Civil Assistance Command immediately announced that it would hand over these two displaced civilians to the Rhee gang on March 2, and allow the Rhee gang to "search" the other thirty-six displaced civilians.

On February 18, the American side unreasonably notified our side that it was only prepared to allow seventy of our displaced civilians to return to their hometowns. This number is less than two ten-thousandths of the 1.5 million civilians displaced in South Korea publicly acknowledged by the Syngman Rhee government. But on February 27, the American side overturned this already absurd figure, saying that it could only return thirty-eight of our displaced civilians. Now, the American side has approved the Syngman Rhee gang to intimidate and persecute these civilians, attempting to force them to abandon their desire to return to their hometowns and detain them.

### 我方协助十九名外籍平民前往美方地区  美李方面合谋扣留要求返乡的我方失所平民

    我方协助十九名外籍平民前往美方地区
    美李方面合谋扣留要求返乡的我方失所平民
   【新华社开城一日电】十九名外籍平民已在一日上午由朝中方面协助越过军事分界线前往美方地区。当他们乘坐两辆大卡车通过板门桥时，他们向朝中人员招呼和挥舞着帽子告别。
    在这些外籍平民到达美方地区后，佩带着手枪的表情冷酷的美国宪兵就把他们带到美方接收站去。这些外籍平民以前都住在汉城，但是美方不让他们立即回汉城过平民生活。据合众社透露：他们将先被送往汶山，“检查身体”和受美国记者访问，随后，将再被送往大邱，作没有宣布期限的“最后处理”。
    这些外籍平民离开开城时，带走了他们的全部私人行李和家庭用具。他们在上汽车出发时，曾向照顾他们的医生护士道谢。
    美方将在二日把朝鲜平民移交给朝中方面。美方曾通知朝中方面将被送回的平民概数为七十名。以后，美方只答应送回三十八人。二月二十八日，美军总司令赫尔又宣布，将再扣留其中两名，把他们送交李承晚匪帮。
   【新华社开城一日电】远东美军总司令赫尔在二月二十八日批准李承晚匪帮以“间谍嫌疑”为借口，迫害和扣留要求返回北朝鲜的我方失所平民。
    据美方通讯社报道，李承晚匪帮在几天以前曾要求赫尔允许他们以“间谍嫌疑”为名，对已进入美方等待营场等待被送回我方的三十八名失所平民进行“甄别”，并且把其中的两名加以逮捕。在赫尔同意了李匪帮的这个非法要求以后，美国的朝鲜民政指挥部立刻宣布，将在三月二日把这两名失所平民移交给李匪帮，并且让李匪帮对另外三十六名失所平民进行“搜查”。
    美方在二月十八日蛮横无理地通知我方，它只准备让七十名我方失所平民返回家乡。这个数字还不到李承晚政府公开承认的流离在南朝鲜的一百五十万平民的两万分之一。但是到二月二十七日，美方又推翻这个本已十分荒谬的数字，说是只能送还三十八名我方失所平民。现在，美方又批准李承晚匪帮对这些平民加以恫吓和迫害，企图迫使他们放弃返回家乡的愿望，把他们扣留下来。
