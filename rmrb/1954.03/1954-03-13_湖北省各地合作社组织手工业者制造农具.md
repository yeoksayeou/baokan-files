    Hubei Province Cooperatives Organize Handicraft Workers to Manufacture Farm Tools
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province are actively organizing handicrafts to manufacture production materials for farmers. Cooperatives in the Huanggang Special District have organized handicrafts to process and manufacture more than 300,000 pieces of large and small farm tools, an increase of 50 percent compared to the actual supply quantity in the special district last year. The farm tools already supplied to farmers in Songzi, Jingshan and other seven counties in the Jingzhou Special District also number more than 49,000 pieces.
    Before signing processing and ordering contracts with handicrafts, supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei generally held forums for handicraft workers under the leadership of the local Party committees to publicize the general line of the state during the transition period, and studied solutions to problems such as insufficient raw materials and lack of funds for handicrafts, as well as processing profits. In addition to the raw materials supplied to handicrafts by local cooperatives, the Hubei Provincial Cooperative Federation also purchased a large amount of wood from other provinces, 750,000 jin of iron, and 6,000 jin of local steel, along with more than 710,000 jin of scrap steel purchased in the province, which were allocated to areas with insufficient raw materials, thus greatly ensuring the smooth progress of processing work.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province generally use methods such as organizing handicraft product exhibitions and convening member representative meetings to understand farmers' opinions on the specifications and quality of production materials, which are used to guide handicraft production. For example, at the handicraft product exhibition held by the Songbu Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Macheng County, farmers put forward many good suggestions, and some even named names to comment on the products of handicraft workers, such as saying: "Xiong Huzi's goods have good style and tempering, when we see them, we all want to buy one." "Master Mei's goods are poor, the hoe sleeve is not easy to install, and the tempering is not good, we don't want such goods." This has a great educational effect on handicraft workers.
    Because the cooperatives in various places paid attention to political and ideological education for handicraft workers in the process of entrusting processing and ordering goods, the quality and production speed of handicraft products have been improved this year, and the cost of some products has also been reduced. For example, the hairy sickles manufactured by handicraft workers organized by the First District Cooperative in Changyang County used to be of poor quality and cost 5,600 yuan per piece, but now the quality has been improved and the cost has been reduced to 5,020 yuan.

    湖北省各地合作社组织手工业者制造农具
    湖北省各地供销合作社积极组织手工业为农民制造生产资料。黄冈专区合作社已组织手工业加工制造大小农具三十余万件，比该专区去年实际供应数量增加百分之五十；荆州专区松滋、京山等七县已经供应给农民的农具，也有四万九千多件。
    在和手工业签订加工、订货合同以前，湖北各地供销合作社一般都在当地党委领导下召开了手工业者座谈会，宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线，并研究了解决手工业原料不足、资金缺乏的办法及加工利润等问题。除各地合作社供应给手工业的原料以外，湖北省合作总社还从外省购进大批木料、七十五万斤铁，六千斤土条钢，连同在本省收购的七十一万多斤废钢铁，分别调拨给原料不足的地区，这样就在很大程度上保证了加工工作的顺利进行。
    湖北省各地供销合作社一般都用组织手工业品展览会、召开社员代表会等方式，了解了农民对生产资料规格、质量的意见，用来指导手工业生产。如麻城县宋埠镇供销合作社举办的手工业品展览会上，农民提出许多好的意见，有的还指名指姓来品评手工业者的产品，如说：“熊胡子的货，式样、钢火都好，我们见了，都想买件把。”“梅师傅的货差，锄头裤不好安把子，钢火也不好，我们就不愿要这样的货。”这对手工业者教育作用很大。
    由于各地合作社在委托加工、订货过程中，注意对手工业者进行了政治思想教育工作，今年手工业产品的质量和生产速度都有了提高，有些产品的成本也降低了。如长阳县第一区合作社组织手工业者制造的毛镰刀，过去质量不好，每把成本五千六百元，现在质量提高了，成本却降低到五千零二十元。　　（郑泽铣　王本直）
