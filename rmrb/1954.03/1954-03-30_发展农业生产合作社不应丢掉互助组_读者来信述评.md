    Developing Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Not Abandon Mutual Aid Teams
    -- Commentary on Readers' Letters
  　Xing Huan
    When vigorously developing agricultural production cooperatives, it is imperative to simultaneously strengthen leadership over various forms of mutual aid teams. This is a principle that every rural work cadre should cautiously grasp. Because mutual aid teams are an important foundation for the development of cooperatives, and agricultural production cooperatives are an important link in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement to continue forward, neglecting either side will affect the work. Many rural work cadres in various places have achieved comprehensive attention to the consolidation and development of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. For example, when the Luan Tian'en mutual aid team in Yongji, Shanxi, was establishing a cooperative, it not only built its own cooperative well, but also helped eight mutual aid teams in the whole village to formulate short-term production plans, and helped farmers who had not been absorbed into the cooperative to rejoin the mutual aid teams. The cooperative cadres also divided the work to help several mutual aid teams solve the existing problems within the teams. Therefore, the masses responded very well, saying: "Cooperatives and mutual aid teams are truly brothers." Now, the organized farmers in the whole village account for 84.4 percent of the total number of households, which creates favorable conditions for the future development of cooperatives.
    According to readers' letters, some cadres in some places have neglected mutual aid teams and abandoned leadership over mutual aid teams when developing agricultural production cooperatives. For example, some cadres believe that they cannot even lead the cooperative, so they do not have time to manage the teams; some believe that as long as the cooperative is run well, it does not matter much whether the mutual aid teams are doing well or badly; some think that running mutual aid teams is too troublesome, it is better to run cooperatives "straightforwardly"; and a few cadres think that it is glorious to run cooperatives, and "unambitious" to run mutual aid teams, and only want to participate in or lead cooperatives, and do not want to lead mutual aid teams. As a result, there are situations where mutual aid teams have problems and cadres do not help solve them, and there are also situations where all the party members, League members, and activists in a township or village are concentrated in one or two cooperatives, and the more numerous mutual aid teams are disintegrating and collapsing due to lack of leadership. According to Yang Sihao, a reader from Shandong, the Ju Fengyi cooperative newly established in Guandi Village, Henan Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, is composed of activists from eight mutual aid teams. There are sixteen party members in the whole cooperative of twenty-three households, including two township cadres and three party branch committee members. The backbone of the original eight mutual aid teams was taken away, and the remaining teams had to be reorganized into five unstable mutual aid teams without backbone leadership. According to Fu Yanlong, a reader from Heilongjiang, the establishment of one cooperative in Qian Village, Zheng Baitou, Wangkui County, Heilongjiang Province, collapsed six teams.
    Why does this tendency of ignoring mutual aid teams occur in the construction of cooperatives? According to the analysis of the situation reflected in the readers' letters, the main reason is that some county and district cooperative cadres have deviations in their understanding. They only know that agricultural production cooperatives are an important link in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement to continue forward, and do not realize that the development of mutual aid teams is an important foundation for the development of cooperatives; they only know that agricultural production cooperatives are a relatively advanced form in the current mutual aid and cooperation movement, and do not realize that although mutual aid teams are a primary form, they are currently universal and exist in large numbers, and are a form that is easier for farmers to accept. Therefore, they only focus on building cooperatives "single-mindedly" and do not ask or care about mutual aid teams.
    Deviations in the propaganda of some cadres are another reason for abandoning leadership over mutual aid teams. When publicizing the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation, they only talk about the superiority of cooperatives, not the superiority of mutual aid teams, and excessively emphasize the contradiction between collective labor and decentralized management of mutual aid teams; they only publicize that cooperatives are a relatively advanced form in the current mutual aid and cooperation movement, and do not publicize what conditions should be met for running cooperatives. As a result, some township and village cadres, activists, and ordinary farmers have the misconception that not participating in cooperatives means "taking the capitalist road" and is a "spontaneous force"; running mutual aid teams is thankless and not as glorious as running cooperatives.
    In addition, in the context of the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the leadership in some areas cannot keep up, but they have not actively taken effective measures to train cadres, so they can only focus their main energy on trying out agricultural production cooperatives, and the leadership of mutual aid teams is naturally relaxed.
    In order to prevent and correct the above-mentioned deviations, all township and village cadres, party members, League members, and activists must clearly understand the relationship between mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and recognize that the responsibility of rural cadres is to lead all farmers to take the road of collectivization and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is necessary to clearly understand that the establishment of cooperatives must be based on needs and possibilities, must have strong leadership backbone and mutual aid foundation, and must be built under the condition that the masses are truly conscious. It is impossible to build a cooperative blindly with enthusiasm without regard to conditions. The leading organs of various localities should deal with those spontaneously established cooperatives according to their respective circumstances. If they have basically met the conditions for establishing a cooperative, they should actively lead them to consolidate it; if the conditions are not yet met, they should persuade and lead the masses to first run the mutual aid teams well and create conditions for establishing a cooperative in the future. Only in this way can the mutual aid and cooperation movement develop normally and healthily.

    发展农业生产合作社不应丢掉互助组
    ——读者来信述评
  　星环
    在大力发展农业生产合作社的时候，必须同时加强对各种形式的互助组的领导，这是每个农村工作干部应该谨慎掌握的原则。因为互助组是合作社发展的重要基础，而农业生产合作社又是领导互助合作运动继续前进的重要环节，偏废了那一边，都会使工作受到影响。许多地方的农村工作干部对于互助组和农业生产合作社巩固、发展做到了全面的照顾，例如山西永济栾天恩互助组在建社时，不但把自己的社建好了，而且还帮助全村八个互助组订了短期生产计划，帮助那些未被吸收入社的农民重新加入了互助组，社干部又分工帮助几个互助组解决了组内存在的问题，因此群众反映很好，说：“合作社、互助组，真是亲兄弟。”现在全村组织起来的农户已占总户数的百分之八十四点四，给以后发展合作社创造了有利条件。
    据读者来信反映，有些地方有些干部在发展农业生产合作社时，发生了轻视互助组、对互助组放弃领导的情况。如有的干部就认为社都领导不过来，那有工夫去管组；有的认为只要把社办好，互助组搞好搞坏关系不大；有的认为搞互助组太麻烦，不如办社“痛快”；还有少数干部则认为办合作社光荣，搞互助组“没出息”，只愿意参加或领导合作社，不愿意领导互助组。因而产生了互助组有了问题找干部帮助解决而干部不管的情况，也产生了一个乡或村的党员、团员、积极分子全部集中到一两个合作社里去，为数更多的互助组因无人领导而涣散、垮台的情况。据山东读者杨思浩反映，该省莒南县河南乡官地村新成立的举凤仪社，就是以八个互助组的积极分子组成的。全社二十三户，就有十六个党员，其中还有两个乡干部和三个党支部委员。原有的八个互助组的骨干抽走了，剩下的只好改组成没有骨干领导的不巩固的五个互助组。又据黑龙江读者傅雁龙反映，该省望奎县正白头前村建一个社就搞垮了六个组。
    为什么在建社中会发生这种不管互助组的偏向呢？根据读者来信所反映的情况分析，主要是由于某些县、区办社干部认识上有偏差，只知道农业生产合作社是领导互助合作运动继续前进的重要环节，没有认识到互助组的发展是合作社发展的重要基础；只知道农业生产合作社是现时互助合作运动中比较高级的形式，没有认识到互助组虽是初级的形式，但它在目前是普遍而大量存在的，是农民较易接受的形式。因此，只是“专心一意”地建社，对互助组不问不管。
    某些干部在宣传上发生了偏差，也是放弃对互助组领导的另一原因。在宣传互助合作的优越性时，光讲合作社的优越性，不讲互助组的优越性，并且过份地强调互助组集体劳动分散经营的矛盾；光宣传合作社是现时互助合作运动中比较高级的形式，不宣传办合作社应该具备那些条件。因而在部分乡村干部、积极分子和一般农民群众中造成错觉，认为不参加合作社就是“走资本主义道路”，就是“自发势力”；搞互助组是吃力不讨好，不如搞合作社光荣。
    此外，在互助合作运动蓬勃发展的情势下，有些地区的领导力量跟不上去，但又没有积极地采取有效办法培养干部，因而只能把主要精力放在试办农业生产合作社方面，对互助组的领导就很自然地放松了。
    为了防止和纠正上述偏向，所有乡、村干部和党员、团员、积极分子，必须明确认识互助组和合作社的关系，认识农村干部的责任就是要带领全体农民一起走合作化的道路、逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造。明确认识建社必须根据需要与可能，必须有坚强的领导骨干和互助基础，必须在群众真正自觉的情况下才能建成，光凭热情不顾条件盲目地建社是建不成功的。各地领导机关对于那些自发搞起来的社应该分别情况予以处理，如果已经基本上具备了建社条件，就应积极加以领导，使它巩固下去；如果条件尚不具备，就应说服并领导群众先搞好互助组，为将来建社创造条件。只有这样，才能使互助合作运动正常地、健康地发展。
