    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the support of the people of the whole country, has in recent years improved the equipment of the original army, built a modern air force and navy, and also built modern artillery, armored, air defense, engineering, communications, railway, public security and other types of different performance of the arms and logistics units. At the same time, the People's Liberation Army also implemented a unified command, a unified system, a unified establishment, unified discipline, and unified training, so that the entire army gradually became regularized and became a highly centralized and unified national defense force with modern equipment. In the process of modernization, the People's Liberation Army has also built a variety of regular military, political, and cultural schools, training and cultivating a large number of cadres. These cadres, after studying, summed up and improved their experience in the long revolutionary war, and learned the advanced military science knowledge of the Soviet army and the command art of modern joint arms operations. These cadres have become the leading backbone of the modernization of the People's Liberation Army.
    In recent years, the People's Liberation Army has conducted a full-army, large-scale cultural study, and the cultural level of all cadres and soldiers has been greatly improved. In order to enhance the physical fitness of cadres and soldiers, various sports activities have also been widely carried out in various units. The People's Liberation Army also carried out land reform, the "Three-Anti" movement, and other education, as well as education on communism and the Communist Party. Recently, it has vigorously carried out propaganda and education on the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, so that the entire army's political consciousness has been raised to a new level.
    The People's Liberation Army's various arms have conducted military training based on the Soviet army as a model and on the PLA’s army-building experience, and the experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers in fighting against US imperialism. The broad masses of commanders and fighters put forward the slogan "Learn skills well and defend the motherland" and studied with the greatest perseverance and diligence. As a result of carrying out regular military training, the troops' ability to master modern equipment and technology has been greatly improved. For example, all the submachine gun live ammunition shooting of a squad of the tenth company of a certain unit achieved excellent results. A fighter in a certain unit was required to use forty bullets for single-gun shooting with a light machine gun, but he used only fifteen bullets to eliminate the hidden and visible targets in three trenches. For example, when the "Jinan First Regiment" practiced the action of launching an assault, each company was able to jump out of the trenches completely within one second, without being ahead or behind.
    The achievements made by the People's Liberation Army in modernization and regularization can be proved by their outstanding contributions to safeguarding the security of the motherland. The People's Liberation Army has systematically recovered many coastal islands and quickly annihilated the remaining Chiang bandit troops commanded by US imperialism. The People's Air Force and air defense forces have repeatedly shot down and wounded enemy aircraft invading our country's airspace with high courage and skill. In 1952, eight US imperialist aircraft invaded our country's airspace over Shenyang, and seven of them were shot down by our army. The People's Air Force, with the same courage and skill, broke through the "air forbidden zone" admired by US imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang over the Kangzang Plateau, creating a miracle in the history of the Air Force. In the struggle to defend the motherland's coastal defense, the People's Navy, with its courageous, accurate actions and highly skilled techniques, sank, damaged, and captured more than 100 ships of the remaining Chiang bandits in four years.
    At present, the People's Liberation Army is deeply studying the Party's general line and general task during the transition period. Under the brilliant light of the general line, the People's Liberation Army is, on the one hand, vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies and sabotage activities, and on the other hand, working harder to carry out modernization. This excellent revolutionary army, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, is striving to defend the motherland's socialist construction and the peace of the Far East and the world.

    解放军全军努力进行现代化建设
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国人民解放军在全国人民的支援下，几年来，已改善了原有陆军的装备，建设了现代化的空军和海军，还建设了现代化的炮兵、装甲、防空、工兵、通讯、铁道、公安等各种不同性能的兵种和后勤部队。同时，人民解放军还实行了统一的指挥、统一的制度、统一的编制、统一的纪律和统一的训练，使全军逐步趋于正规，成为一支高度集中统一的、具有现代化装备的国防武装。在现代化建设过程中，人民解放军还建设了各种正规的军事、政治、文化学校，训练和培养了大批的干部，这些干部经过学习，总结和提高了他们在长期革命战争中的经验，学习了苏军的先进军事科学知识和现代的联合兵种作战的指挥艺术。这些干部，已成为人民解放军现代化建设中的领导骨干。
    几年来，人民解放军进行了全军的、大规模的文化学习，全体干部、战士的文化水平已大大提高。为了增强干部、战士的体质，各部队还广泛展开了各种体育活动。人民解放军还进行了土地改革、“三反”运动等教育和共产主义与共产党的教育，最近又大张旗鼓地进行了党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的宣传教育，使全军的政治觉悟提高到了新的水平。
    人民解放军各兵种进行了以苏联军队为榜样、以人民解放军的建军经验和中国人民志愿军与美帝国主义作战的经验为基础的军事训练。广大指挥员、战斗员提出“学好本领、保卫祖国”的口号，以最大的毅力和勤学苦练的精神进行学习。进行正规军事训练的结果，部队掌握现代化装备和技术的能力已大大提高。例如某部十连一个班的冲锋枪实弹射击全部达到优秀成绩。某部战士轻机枪单枪射击按规定为四十发子弹，而他只用了十五发子弹就消灭了三道堑壕的隐显目标。又如“济南第一团”演习冲锋发起的动作时，各连都做到一秒钟内全部跃出堑壕，没有超前或落后的。
    人民解放军在现代化、正规化建设中所获得的成就，可从他们保卫祖国安全的卓越贡献中得到证明。人民解放军有计划地收复了沿海的许多岛屿，并迅速地歼灭了美帝国主义指挥来犯的残余蒋匪军。人民空军和防空部队曾以高度的勇敢和技术，屡次击落和击伤了侵犯我国领空的敌机。一九五二年，美帝国主义飞机八架侵入我国沈阳领空，即被我军击落七架。人民空军又以同样的勇敢和技巧，在康藏高原上空，突破了被美帝国主义和国民党匪帮所惊叹的“空中禁区”，创造了空军史上的奇迹。在保卫祖国海防的斗争中，人民海军以勇猛、准确的动作和高度熟练的技巧，在四年中击沉、击伤和俘获残余蒋匪的舰艇一百多艘。
    目前，人民解放军正在深入学习党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。在总路线的光辉照耀下，人民解放军一面警惕着敌人的阴谋破坏活动，一面更加努力地进行现代化的建设。这支优良的革命军队，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下正在努力地为保卫祖国的社会主义建设和远东与世界的和平而奋斗。
