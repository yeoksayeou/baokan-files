    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Hebei Province Promptly Supply Farmers with Cotton Seeds
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in Baoding, Tianjin, Handan and other regions of Hebei Province are actively supplying farmers with cotton seeds to support cotton planting. By early March, supply and marketing cooperatives in Tianjin and Handan regions had allocated more than 3.78 million jin of cotton seeds to grassroots cooperatives, and more than 750,000 jin had been supplied to farmers. The cotton seeds prepared by the Baoding region cooperative this year have been increased by 3 million jin compared with the original plan. After quality identification, they are being transported to grassroots cooperatives one after another. In addition, the region also supplied 1 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds to the Tangshan region.
    In order to do a good job in cotton seed supply, the Tianjin, Handan and other regional offices of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held meetings of county cooperative directors and made specific arrangements. Before formulating the cotton seed supply plan in the Baoding region, the Good Cotton Office organized by the agricultural department and the cooperative also sent cadres to the countryside to investigate the situation of farmers' self-retained cotton seeds. The Handan Regional Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped Cheng'an, Yongnian and other eight counties to adjust more than 4.4 million jin of cotton seeds among themselves, and helped the counties solve many specific problems. Cooperatives in many counties publicized the benefits of promoting high-quality cotton seeds to farmers, and tried to facilitate farmers' purchase of cotton seeds. For example, the Ji County Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of pre-sale to supply farmers with cotton seeds in advance, so that farmers had time to pick and choose seeds, which was welcomed by farmers.

    河北各地供销合作社及时供应农民棉种
    河北省保定、天津、邯郸等专区的供销合作社积极供应农民棉种，支援农民种棉。在三月初，天津、邯郸专区供销合作社分拨到基层合作社的棉种有三百七十八万多斤，供应给农民的已经有七十五万多斤。保定专区合作社今年准备供应的棉种比原计划增加了三百万斤，经过鉴定品质后，正陆续运到基层合作社。另外，该专区还供应给唐山专区一百万斤优良棉种。
    为了作好棉种供应工作，河北省供销合作总社天津、邯郸等专区办事处都召开县合作社主任会议，作了具体布置。保定专区制定棉种供应计划以前，农业部门和合作社组织的良棉办公室还派干部下乡调查了群众自留棉种的情况。河北省供销合作总社邯郸专区办事处帮助成安、永年等八县互相调剂了四百四十多万斤棉种，并帮助各县解决了许多具体问题。许多县的合作社向农民宣传了推广优良棉种的好处，并设法便利农民购买棉种。如冀县供销合作社采用预售办法提前供应农民棉种，使农民有时间拣种选种，受到农民欢迎。
