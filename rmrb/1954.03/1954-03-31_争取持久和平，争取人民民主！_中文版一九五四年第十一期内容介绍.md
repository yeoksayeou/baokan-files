"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition, 1954, No. 11

The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, No. 11, 1954, has been published.

This issue publishes in full the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee "On Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land," and publishes an editorial entitled "Soviet Agriculture Embarks on the Road to Further Vigorous Development." The editorial points out: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is firmly and confidently leading the Soviet people towards the complete victory of communism. Heavy industry, the heart of the Soviet socialist economy, is developing rapidly. The Soviet people have also made great achievements in agriculture. However, for the sake of communist construction and to meet the ever-growing material needs of the working people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that further development of agriculture is the most urgent task in the country. In the past six months, the CPSU Central Committee has held two plenary sessions to discuss the urgent task of further developing agricultural production in the Soviet Union. The recent plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee adopted the "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land," which stipulates specific measures for further expanding grain production. This is because grain production is the foundation of the entire agricultural production. Whether other agricultural sectors (including animal husbandry) can be further developed, and whether the growing needs of residents and the needs of the entire national economy can be met, depends on whether grain production can develop smoothly. The editorial concludes: The entire Soviet people warmly welcome the resolution of the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee. In the struggle to strive for further upsurge in agriculture and thereby improve the material life of the working people, the unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants is becoming increasingly consolidated.

This issue also publishes a statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the results of the Berlin Conference, as well as an article by Dominique Urbany, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, entitled "The People of Luxembourg Oppose Listening to the Commands of the United States."

Urbany's article summarizes the situation in which Luxembourg's Christian Social Party and other parties and politicians have dragged Luxembourg into the tide of Western countries' arms expansion and war preparations, and analyzes the situation in which the living standards of the working people have been reduced and the national economy is on the verge of collapse due to these parties' policy of obeying the orders of the United States. The article emphasizes that the Communist Party of Luxembourg has long been waging a tenacious struggle against the entire policy of succumbing to monopoly capital and war-makers, and against the traitorous policy. Thanks to the efforts of the Communist Party and other mass organizations standing on the same front, we have achieved some successes. The Communist Party's call to fight for the defense of national sovereignty has penetrated into small towns and villages, inspiring the broad masses of the people. Since the Soviet delegation put forward a concrete program for easing international tensions and establishing a pan-European collective security system at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the struggle of the working people of Luxembourg against the threat of a new war and against the rearmament of West Germany has become stronger and more effective.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第十一期已经出版。
    本期全文刊载了苏共中央“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的决议，并以“苏联农业走上了进一步蓬勃发展的道路”为题发表社论。社论指出：苏联共产党正在坚定地、满怀信心地领导苏联人民走向共产主义的完全胜利。作为苏联社会主义经济的心脏的重工业正在迅速发展。苏联人民在农业方面也取得了巨大的成就。但是为了共产主义建设，为了满足劳动人民不断增长的物质需要，苏联共产党认为进一步发展农业是全国最迫切的任务。在过去六个月中，苏共中央曾经两次举行全体会议，讨论了关于进一步发展苏联农业生产的迫切任务。最近举行的苏共中央全体会议，通过了“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的决议，规定了进一步扩大谷物生产的具体办法。这是因为谷物生产是整个农业生产的基础。其他农业部门（包括饲畜业）能否得到进一步发展，居民的日益增长的需要和整个国民经济的需要能否得到满足，都取决于谷物生产能否顺利发展。社论最后说：全苏联人民都热烈欢迎苏共中央全体会议的决议。在争取农业的进一步高涨从而提高劳动人民的物质生活的斗争中，牢不可破的工农联盟越来越巩固了。
    本期还刊载了苏联外交部长莫洛托夫关于柏林会议的结果的声明，以及卢森堡共产党中央委员会总书记多·欧班尼的题为“卢森堡人民反对听从美国的指挥”的文章。
    欧班尼的文章综述了卢森堡天主教社会党等政党和政客把卢森堡卷入西方国家扩军备战的浪潮中的情形，分析了由于这些政党奉行顺从美国号令的政策而造成劳动人民生活降低和国民经济濒于崩溃的情况。文章强调说：长期以来，卢森堡共产党一直进行着顽强的斗争，反对向垄断资本和战争制造者屈服的全部政策，反对卖国政策。由于共产党和跟它站在同一战线上的其他群众团体的努力奋斗，我们已经获得了某些成就。共产党发出的为保卫国家主权而斗争的号召，已深入到小城镇和乡村，鼓舞着广大的人民。自从苏联代表团在柏林四国外长会议上提出了缓和国际紧张局势、建立全欧洲集体安全体系的具体纲领以后，卢森堡劳动人民反对新战争威胁和反对重新武装西德的斗争更加坚强有力了。（新华社）
