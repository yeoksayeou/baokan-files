The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU
Resolution on Khrushchev's Report "On Further Expansion of Grain Production in the USSR and on the Cultivation of Virgin and Fallow Lands"
— March 2, 1954

I.
The Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU in September 1953 defined the most urgent task for the country as: on the basis of the powerful development of socialist industry, to fully satisfy the growing needs of the Soviet people for consumer goods in the next two to three years and to ensure the supply of raw materials to light industry and the food industry. In accordance with the resolution of the Plenum, party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies have done a great deal of work in the past period to create the necessary conditions for the task of significantly developing all sectors of agriculture.

To implement the resolution of the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, collective farmers, machine-tractor stations, and state farms have performed their autumn field work better than in previous years. Compared to 1952, collective farms and state farms in 1953 plowed an additional 13 million hectares of autumn plowed land and 3.5 million hectares of fallow land. In most republics, territories, and regions, the sowing of winter crops and the preparation of land for spring sowing in 1954 were completed more compactly and within the more appropriate agricultural technical time limits.

Due to the implementation of the resolution of the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee and the decisions taken by the party and government in 1953, especially in the second half of the year, the income of the peasants increased significantly. The state, on the one hand, reduced the retail prices of goods that peasants need to purchase by an average of 11 percent, and on the other hand, significantly increased the procurement prices for meat, dairy products, wool, potatoes, and vegetables that collective farms and collective farmers are obligated to deliver to the state. Now the system of state procurement of meat, dairy products, vegetables, and potatoes is in effect, with procurement prices much higher than procurement prices. The arrears of collective farms in the delivery of livestock products, potatoes, and vegetables have been completely canceled. The norms for the obligatory delivery of livestock products and potatoes from the private subsidiary farms of collective farmers have been reduced, and the agricultural tax for collective farmers has been reduced. The arrears in agricultural tax for the past few years have been completely forgiven. In addition, all arrears in the delivery of livestock products and potatoes from the private subsidiary farms of collective farmers over the past few years have been completely canceled. Due to the reduction in the obligatory deliveries of collective farms and collective farmers, they can sell a large amount of commodity products to the state at higher procurement prices. Due to the above economic measures to encourage collective farms and collective farmers and some measures in tax policy, the income of collective farms and collective farmers increased by more than 13 billion rubles in 1953.

Consistently adhering to the principle of the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in the development of agricultural production should be and will be a constant concern of party organizations and Soviet bodies.

Given that the success or failure of various national economic measures depends on people, on cadres, the party, in order to implement the resolution of the Plenum, first of all, paid attention to the cadre issue, especially the issue of cadres in machine-tractor stations. After the Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, about 125,000 tractor drivers, tractor brigade leaders, operators of complex agricultural machinery, and other personnel were assigned to machine-tractor stations for permanent work. About 50,000 mechanics responded to the party's call and returned to machine-tractor stations from industry and other sectors of the national economy.

In the past few months, more than 100,000 agronomists and livestock specialists have been sent to machine-tractor stations to serve collective farms. About 23,000 engineers and technical personnel have been transferred from industry and other sectors of the national economy to work in machine-tractor stations. Thus, the ranks of experts in machine-tractor stations and collective farms have been significantly strengthened. Expert cadres are closer to the places that are decisive for agricultural production.

However, in the work of supplementing machine-tractor stations and collective farms with qualified cadres, there are significant shortcomings. Some leading officials of party organizations and Soviet bodies probably did not understand that without solving the cadre issue, it is impossible to ensure the rapid growth of all sectors of agriculture.

In many machine-tractor stations, especially in the regions of Oryol, Kursk, Kalinin, and others, a large number of permanent cadres have not yet been selected and included in the staff of machine-tractor stations. A significant part of the workers are formally part of the staff of machine-tractor stations, but despite the large amount of work in winter, they do not work in machine-tractor stations and collective farms. The labor of permanent workers in machine-tractor stations is poorly organized. In the regions of Bryansk, Vladimir, and others, work has not been well organized to mobilize machine operators who have gone to work in industry and other sectors of the national economy to return to machine-tractor stations. There are significant shortcomings in the training of machine operators: many mechanization schools and training courses for this type of cadre have insufficient quotas, and some schools and training courses have curricula that are detached from the urgent tasks of agricultural production. Party organizations, Soviet bodies, agricultural agencies, and the directors of machine-tractor stations and state farms must improve educational work so that machine operators better study advanced methods of crop cultivation, study new technologies, and master new skills. In some regions, territories, and republics, there are serious shortcomings in the selection and placement of agricultural experts. Often, experts are first sent to machine-tractor stations or collective farms near city or district centers, while the most remote machine-tractor stations and collective farms still do not receive the addition of leadership cadres and experts. The most experienced experts are often sent to advanced collective farms, while those collective farms that are economically weak and most in need of skilled help receive less experienced agronomists and livestock specialists. Some machine-tractor stations have not prepared the necessary housing and living conditions for the experts who have come to work.

The most important issue that party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies have not yet solved in the selection of agricultural cadres is the issue of selecting chairmen of collective farms. Only a small number of party organizations have taken some measures to strengthen the leadership cadres of collective farms. While most regions, territories, and republics obviously do not attach enough importance to this important matter. Yet, the further improvement and comprehensive development of the public economy of collective farms largely depends on the selection of chairmen of collective farms. It has been proven that if a collective farm is led by an active chairman who is proficient in his work and knows how to organize the masses, then even the most backward farm can become advanced in two to three years, and the members can receive high income from labor days. In such collective farms, the interests of the state and the people are correctly combined with the interests of the collective farm and the collective farmers. Conversely, if a collective farm is led by a chairman who is carelessly selected and cannot manage socialist large-scale production, then even a collective farm with rich production potential will begin to lag behind and decline.

In the Kazakh Republic, Altai Territory, Kalinin Region, Gorky Region, Chelyabinsk Region, Voronezh Region, Novgorod Region, Pskov Region, Oryol Region, Bryansk Region, and the Tatar Autonomous Republic, the resolution of the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee on strengthening the leadership cadres of collective farms has been particularly poorly implemented.

The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee demands that party organizations, Soviet bodies, agricultural agencies, and the directors of machine-tractor stations correct the irresponsible attitude towards the selection of leadership cadres of collective farms and solve the fundamental issue of strengthening collective farms both organizationally and economically.

The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in September adopted a broad program to strengthen the material and technical base of socialist agriculture. Our industry, only in the fourth quarter of 1953, in order to implement the resolution of the Plenum, provided agriculture with 42,000 tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 11,000 grain combine harvesters, 22,000 tractor-drawn seeders, thousands of tractor-drawn mowers, and other first-class machines. On the basis of powerful heavy industry, the machinery available to our agriculture is becoming more modern and faster every year. By the beginning of 1954, machine-tractor stations had more than 1 million tractors (each with 15 horsepower), including 460,000 diesel tractors, 270,000 grain combine harvesters, about 450,000 tractor-drawn grain seeders, 260,000 tractor-drawn mowers, and many other improved machines.

The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee simultaneously noted that the leaders of the Ministry of Machine Building and some factory directors have not satisfactorily executed the tasks of manufacturing agricultural machinery entrusted to them, and they have shown a non-state attitude on this issue. In 1953, the production plan for "Belarus" tractors was not fulfilled. The production task for "CKL-4" potato planters was completed by 59 percent, "KOK-2" potato harvesters by 38 percent, "KOH-2.8" tractor-drawn cultivators by 89 percent. In the fourth quarter of 1953, the task of producing "COH-2.8" vegetable seeders was completed by only 60 percent, "CPH-4" planters by 13 percent, "KPH-2.8" cultivators by 60 percent. The leaders of many enterprises of the Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machine Building have taken an irresponsible attitude towards the constant supply of all spare parts to machine-tractor stations.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, some regional, territorial, and republican Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies have not satisfactorily carried out the construction of machine-tractor stations. In 1953, the construction plan for repair shops was completed by only 57 percent, and the construction of sheds and open sheds for storing agricultural machinery was completed by only 70 percent.

Due to the measures taken by the party and government to materially encourage collective farms and collective farmers to develop public livestock farming, the dispatch of many agricultural experts to work in collective farms, the organizational and technical assistance of machine-tractor stations to the winter maintenance of livestock in collective farms, and the change of the date for calculating livestock from January 1 to October 1, the conditions for livestock farming in farms have improved somewhat. In 1953, the procurement and collection of meat, dairy products, and wool were better than in 1952. However, collective farms did not fulfill the state plan for increasing the number of cattle and sheep in the development of livestock farming. The plan for storing feed was not fulfilled. Less coarse feed was procured than in 1952. In many regions, territories, and republics, especially in Lisen, Tambov, Pskov, Kostroma, Tula, Novgorod, Oryol, Yaroslavl, and others, the number of cattle decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 1953.

To implement the resolution of the September Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, the central committees of the Communist Party of the republics, territorial party committees, and regional party committees have begun to strengthen the political work of the party in the countryside. Party district-level organizations have begun to reorganize their work to pay more attention to the production of collective farms and state farms. Some guidance groups led by district party committee secretaries have been established to directly conduct party political work in machine-tractor stations and collective farms.

However, the reorganization of agricultural management bodies and party political work in the countryside is proceeding very slowly, which seriously hinders the solution of economic tasks, because without fundamentally improving the leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, and without seriously raising the level of party political and organizational work in the countryside, it is impossible to successfully advance agriculture.

II. Current State and Increase of Grain Production
The Tasks of Grain Production
(1) To fulfill the nationwide task of rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods set by the party and government, it is of special importance to further develop grain, which is the basis of the entire agricultural production. More fully satisfying the growing demand of the population for high-quality food products primarily depends on increasing grain production. To solve the problem of livestock farming in a short period, it is necessary to ensure that all livestock receive sufficient feed grains—corn, barley, and oats. In cotton-growing and hemp-growing regions, due to the increase in the production of industrial raw material crops, due to the development of vegetable, potato, and livestock farming bases near cities and industrial centers, more grain is also needed for the population of these regions.

The socialist planned national economy must establish state grain reserves and improve them every year. In addition, the state should have surplus grain to increase the growing exports.

Thus, the further development of other sectors of agriculture, the satisfaction of the growing needs of the population and the entire national economy, depends on the results of the development of grain.

In this regard, the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party considers that the current level of grain production, both in terms of total production and commodity production, cannot satisfy the growing needs of the national economy. The amount of grain at the disposal of the state and the demand for grain are not in harmony. The grain remaining in collective farms after fulfilling their obligations to the state is also insufficient to meet all the needs of the public economy of collective farms; many collective farmers receive low grain remuneration for labor days. There is even less feed grain left, and without feed grain, it is impossible to rapidly increase livestock farming.

(2) The Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party considers that the current level of grain development and the growing demand for grain at the present stage of the state are not in harmony for many reasons.

Although the total sown area in 1953 increased by 6.8 million hectares compared to 1940, the sown area of grain decreased by 3.8 million hectares, the sown area of feed grains (corn, barley, oats) decreased significantly, i.e., by 6.8 million hectares, the sown area of such grain crops as millet, buckwheat, and rice decreased by 1.3 million hectares, and the sown area of legumes decreased by 0.8 million hectares.

Although Soviet socialist agriculture is the most mechanized agriculture in the world, and the most modern machines in agriculture are increasing every year, the level of agricultural technical measures currently adopted is still not sufficient to guarantee a grain harvest on all lands. The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, and their local bodies, many machine-tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms do not pay attention to the agricultural technology of grain cultivation, have not completed the task of plowing fallow and autumn plowed lands, have reduced sowing norms, delayed sowing and harvesting periods, and caused huge losses in harvests.

One of the basic reasons for the lag of the current level of grain production development behind the growing demand of the population and the national economy for grain is that the State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR made serious mistakes in planning the sown area, especially in planning the sown area of grain and forage crops. Due to the mechanical adoption of the crop rotation system without considering the characteristics of the domestic regions, the sown area of grain in the regions of Ukraine, the North Caucasus, the Volga region, and the Central Black Earth region has decreased.

This erroneous planning work has caused great losses to the grain development of our country.

(3) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee considers that the current task of the state is to rapidly increase the production of grain, feed grain, rice, and legumes, so that the grain procured and collected by the state in the next few years will increase by 35 to 40 percent compared to 1953.

Our agriculture is equipped with a large number of first-class machines, so it is possible to mechanize all major agricultural work. Now we have the necessary leadership cadres for leading socialist large-scale production—machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms. There is an army of agricultural experts and agricultural machine operators serving agricultural production. Finally, the Soviet state also has abundant land.

Thus, our socialist agriculture has all the possibilities to significantly increase grain production.

III. Cultivation of Virgin and Fallow Lands is a Great Reserve Force for Increasing Grain Production
(1) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee considers that in addition to increasing the yield per unit area of grain in all regions of the country, the cultivation of new lands also has great significance for increasing grain production. An important and completely realistic reserve force for increasing grain production in the short term is the expansion of the grain sown area, i.e., the cultivation of virgin and fallow lands in the regions of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga region, and part of the North Caucasus. These regions have vast tracts of fertile black and brown lands that do not require significant investment to obtain a harvest.

The experience of collective farms and state farms in Siberia and Kazakhstan proves that it is completely possible to harvest 14 to 15 centners of spring wheat per hectare from each hectare of cultivated virgin and fallow land, and advanced farms can harvest 20 to 25 centners or more per hectare. For example, the "Petropavlovsk" state farm in Chelyabinsk Region harvested an average of 22 centners of wheat per hectare in 1953 on 19,000 hectares of land (including 10,000 hectares of recently cultivated land). The "Path of Lenin" collective farm in Konukhovsky District, North Kazakhstan Region, had an average actual yield of 14.5 centners of spring wheat per hectare, and on 350 hectares of newly cultivated virgin land, 30 centners per hectare were harvested.

The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee assigns a very important state task to the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga region, and the North Caucasus, as well as to the machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms of these regions, to cultivate at least 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow lands in 1954-1955 to expand the grain sown area, and to harvest 11 to 12 billion poods of grain from these lands in 1955, including 8 to 9 billion poods of commercial grain.

(2) The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Kazakh Republic, the regional and territorial party committees of Siberia, the Urals, the Volga region, and the North Caucasus, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, the executive committees of the regions and territories, the directors of machine-tractor stations, and the directors of state farms are instructed to increase the sown area of collective farms and state farms: according to the national economic plan, the sown area of wheat and millet in 1954 should be increased by 2.3 million hectares, of which 1.8 million hectares are for collective farms and 0.5 million hectares are for state farms; in 1955, the sown area of grain should be increased by at least another 10.7 million hectares.

In 1955, grain will generally be sown on new cultivated lands, mainly on well-prepared fallow lands and early autumn plowed lands.

(3) The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh Republic, local Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies should, by June 1, 1954, but not later than this date, first select and allocate the most fertile virgin and fallow lands, meadows and pastures with little grass near settlements, to expand the grain sown area in collective farms and state farms. At the same time, use state lands to organize new state grain farms and increase the land of state farms and collective farms.

(4) To timely carry out the plowing of new lands, the preparation of land before sowing, the sowing and harvesting of grain, and to obtain grain with the least labor, it is necessary to ensure that all work on the cultivation and tillage of grain is fully mechanized.

To complete the work of cultivating virgin and fallow lands and plowing meadows and pastures with little grass, and to further increase the sown area of wheat, 120,000 tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 10,000 combine harvesters, a corresponding number of tractor-drawn plows, seeders, heavy disk harrows, cultivators, and other agricultural machines will be sent to the newly cultivated regions in 1954. To provide technical services, the necessary number of cars, mobile repair shops, repair shops, fuel tankers, fixed fuel tanks, tools, and equipment will be provided to machine-tractor stations.

(5) The Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party requires all party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies to pay attention to the fact that the successful completion of the work of cultivating virgin and fallow lands primarily depends on the correct dispatch of experienced leaders, engineering and technical cadres, and agricultural expert cadres to the newly cultivated regions, and the dispatch of machine operators, including them in the staff of tractor brigades of machine-tractor stations and state farms of these regions.

The Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party considers it an urgent measure to ensure the personnel of machine-tractor stations and state farms, therefore it is necessary to dispatch experienced cadres from the current personnel of machine-tractor stations and state farms to machine-tractor stations and state farms of newly cultivated lands, and at the same time to train tractor drivers and combine operators in agricultural mechanization vocational schools, agricultural mechanization schools, and training courses of machine-tractor stations, as well as in state farms, to supplement the necessary cadres. The shortage of personnel in new state farms of newly cultivated lands should be supplemented in an organized manner.

The tasks set by the Central Committee of the Party for the central committees of the Communist Party of the republics, territorial party committees, and regional party committees, the councils of ministers of the republics, executive committees of territories and regions, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, and all levels of party organizations, trade union organizations, and Komsomol organizations are: on the basis of extensive propaganda, to dispatch leadership personnel, experts, and skilled workers to state farms and machine-tractor stations of newly cultivated lands in 1954. Not only should personnel be transferred from existing machine-tractor stations and state farms, but also from industry and other sectors of the national economy. The work of transferring personnel to newly cultivated regions should be considered as the execution of an important task of the party and government, as a patriotic cause.

Every enterprise, organization, and institution should consider the dispatch of experts and skilled workers from their units who are willing to work in newly cultivated regions as an honorable duty.

(6) Approve the initiative of the Central Committee of the Leninist Communist Youth League of the USSR and local Komsomol organizations to mobilize 100,000 machine operators from among Komsomol members and youth to voluntarily work in machine-tractor stations and state farms of newly cultivated lands.

(7) All engineers, technicians, agronomists, livestock specialists, and other agricultural experts, tractor drivers, combine operators, skilled repair workers, accountants, and other personnel transferred from other machine-tractor stations, state farms, industrial enterprises, and organizations to work in machine-tractor stations, state farms, and procurement agencies of virgin and fallow lands will be paid a one-time allowance equal to three months' salary, and travel expenses will be paid to the transferred personnel according to Article 82 of the Labor Code.

(8) To ensure that the personnel of tractor brigades of machine-tractor stations and state farms of newly cultivated lands have the necessary living conditions, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies are instructed to organize field rest camps in 1954, to provide housing, dining, and bathing facilities, and to organize public dining rooms and water supply for the personnel. The Ministry of Trade of the USSR and the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the USSR must widely use mobile stores to sell food and consumer goods to tractor brigades.

The Ministry of Culture of the USSR and the Central Council of Trade Unions of the USSR must ensure the cultural life (films, radio, newspapers, magazines, etc.) of the personnel of tractor brigades of machine-tractor stations and state farms of newly cultivated lands. The Ministry of Health of the USSR must ensure medical services for these workers.

(9) To materially encourage collective farms, collective farmers, and the personnel of machine-tractor stations to execute the plan for cultivating new lands and obtaining a grain harvest, the following incentive measures are adopted:

(1) It is proposed that collective farms, based on the decision of the general meeting of field workers and tractor brigade personnel, allocate up to 30 percent of the grain harvested in excess of the planned yield per unit area on newly sown lands as additional remuneration.

(2) It is proposed that collective farms, based on the decision of the general meeting of collective farmers, advance the remuneration for labor days to collective farmers, the amount of which can reach about 25 percent of the grain proceeds from the state for the sown area of new lands.

(3) The Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the USSR is instructed to sell industrial goods, trucks, trailers, electric motors, building materials, and other production and economic goods to collective farms in proportion to the grain sold to the state, with the following ratio: for every 100 rubles of grain sold by a collective farm, the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the USSR will sell goods with a retail value of 50 rubles to the collective farm.

(4) Exceptionally, the directors of machine-tractor stations are authorized to additionally deduct 75 kopecks from each pood of grain actually delivered to the state by each collective farm, as a reward for the tractor brigades and special brigades of machine-tractor stations. The above method of deducting funds for rewards is applicable only in the case of the completion of the plan for sowing and actual harvest of grain on virgin and fallow lands.

It is stipulated that in 1954-1955, the wages of workers, employees, experts, and leaders of new state farms of cultivated virgin and fallow lands will be increased by 15 percent.

(10) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee considers that the task of increasing grain production, in addition to requiring the cultivation of virgin and fallow lands in the regions of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga region, and the North Caucasus, also requires the cultivation of unused lands in other regions of the country, especially in the non-black soil regions, the clearing of shrubs and forests, the drainage of marshes, and thus significantly expanding the sown area in these regions.

The completion of these works will make it possible to put a batch of new fertile lands into production in the near future, to expand the sown area of grain, vegetables, potatoes, and feed crops in the densely populated industrial regions of the country, and thus significantly improve the supply of fresh vegetables, potatoes, dairy products, and meat to the residents of cities and industrial centers.

The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee points out the serious shortcomings in the organization of the cultivation of new lands in the non-black soil regions. The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, local party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies have scattered funds and materials on many small plots of cultivated lands. Due to this, it is impossible to use industrial methods to improve the soil when cultivating new lands, it is impossible to ensure complete mechanization, and machines are not used effectively, and a lot of manpower and material resources are spent to cultivate each hectare of land.

It is necessary to fundamentally change the work of cultivating new lands in the non-black soil regions, and in the future, to concentrate on improving the soil with machines to cultivate large areas of land, and to widely use industrial methods to carry out the work.

(11) First of all, it is necessary to start working on the drainage and cultivation of such lands as the Mechior Lowland (especially the lowlands of the regions of Lisen, Vladimir, and Moscow), the floodplains of the Trubesh River in the Ukrainian Republic, etc.

The State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, the Council of Ministers of the Byelorussian Republic, the Council of Ministers of the Latvian Republic, the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian Republic, and the Council of Ministers of the Estonian Republic are instructed to submit proposals within two months on the cultivation of large areas of virgin and fallow lands and marshes for sowing, and to establish special construction and design organizations for this purpose, and to provide the corresponding material and technical equipment, so that this work can begin in the near future.

Lands that have been abandoned due to the war and the weakness of individual collective farms, and that require little cultivation, should be put into production first.

(12) The Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party points out that in 1954-1955, 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow lands will be cultivated in the eastern and southeastern regions of the USSR, and virgin and fallow lands will also be cultivated in the non-black soil regions and other regions of the USSR. This work is only the beginning of the national large-scale work of increasing grain production and other agricultural products by using vast lands that have not been used before.

To successfully complete the plan of cultivating virgin lands and expanding the grain sown area on virgin and fallow lands, it is first necessary to rely on the specific and effective leadership of party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies for this national cause, the organizational and technical preparations of machine-tractor stations and state farms, and the mobilization of collective farmers, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to execute the above tasks.

IV. On the Planned Nature of Agriculture, Changing the Proportions of Crop Sowing, and Increasing the Yield per Unit Area
Rationally using the sown area and significantly increasing the yield per unit area of grain is of great importance for successfully solving the task of significantly increasing grain production.

(A) On Expanding the Sowing Area of Wheat, Feed Grains, Rice, and Legumes
(1) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee points out that the current state of the proportions of crop sowing proves that there are shortcomings in consideration, poor management, and mechanical adoption of the crop rotation system without considering the characteristics of the different regions of our country. The State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR have taken incorrect directions in agricultural planning, which is manifested in the following two aspects: on the one hand, in the southern and southeastern regions of the USSR, in the dry and semi-dry regions of Ukraine and Moldavia, in the North Caucasus, and in the southeastern regions of our country, the sown area of low-yielding perennial grasses has been unreasonably expanded; on the other hand, the sown area of grain, especially corn, legumes, rice, and feed grains, has been significantly reduced. The result of this incorrect planning is that the sown area of grain has been significantly reduced, and the total production of rice, legumes, and feed grains has decreased.

The State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, the party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies of the southern and southeastern regions, territories, and republics are instructed to take measures to correct the errors in the implementation of the crop rotation system and to correct the proportions of crop sowing distribution, so that starting from 1954, the sown area of low-yielding perennial grasses will be reduced, and the sown area of grain, especially rice, legumes, and feed grains, will be significantly increased.

(2) The State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, in cooperation with the union republics, are instructed to draft proposals within three months on the distribution of the sown area of crops in the regions (including the cultivation of virgin and fallow lands and the more complete use of cultivated lands) for 1955, and submit them to the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The principle of these proposals is to expand the sown area of grain, legumes, rice, feed grains, corn, sugar beets, sunflowers, cotton, flax for fiber, root feed, green feed, and to significantly expand the area of orchards and vineyards.

(3) Given the serious shortcomings in the current agricultural planning system, namely, the excessive centralization of planning restricts the initiative of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms in developing agricultural production, the State Planning Committee of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, and the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, in cooperation with the union republics, are instructed to draft proposals within two months on changing the methods of agricultural planning to give greater initiative to local areas in planning agricultural production, and submit them to the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

(B) On Further Measures to Increase the Yield per Unit Area of Grain
(1) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee requests all levels of party organizations, Soviet bodies, agricultural agencies, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to pay special attention to the necessity of significantly increasing the yield per unit area of grain, which has always been the main method of increasing grain production.

The socialist management system makes it possible to obtain stable high yields. The actual situation of advanced collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms in various regions of the country proves this every year. However, in many regions of the country, due to the serious violation of the agricultural technology of grain cultivation, the yield per unit area of grain is still very low. A large part of the sowing work is carried out on spring plowed land, the amount of local and mineral fertilizers applied to grain is very small, and the method of seed selection is slowly promoted in many regions. In the non-black soil regions, almost no lime is applied to acidic soils, and very little manure, peat, and other local fertilizers are applied to the fields, and in such regions without the application of fertilizers, even with a high level of mechanization, grain will not have a good harvest.

(2) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee suggests that all levels of party organizations, Soviet bodies, agricultural agencies, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms pay attention to the following issues regarding the increase in yield per unit area: the widespread adoption of advanced methods in agricultural technology; the improvement of the use of tractors; the timely adoption and mastery of the correct crop rotation system; the improvement of the quality of field work and the reduction of the time of field work; the improvement of seed selection work; the significant increase in the accumulation of local fertilizers (manure, peat, etc.) and the increase in the use of these fertilizers, the better use of mineral fertilizers, the application of lime to acidic soils and gypsum to saline soils; the resolute elimination of the loss of grain during harvesting, transportation, and storage; the planned elimination of crop diseases and pests.

The councils of ministers of the republics, the executive committees of the territories and regions are instructed to draft and approve the minimum agricultural technology regulations that must be observed for various crops, including: the most suitable sowing period, sowing norms, the period of plowing fallow land, the period of preparing land for winter crops and sowing winter crops, the collection of straw left by combine harvesters, autumn plowing work, measures to protect seeds sown in winter from damage, and other measures. In these regulations, responsibility must be assigned for violating the mandatory agricultural technology regulations.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, and the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences are instructed to assist and provide opinions when the councils of ministers of the republics, the executive committees of the territories and regions draft the minimum mandatory agricultural technology regulations.

(3) In the measures to increase the yield per unit area, the timely plowing of autumn plowed and fallow lands is of primary importance. The following situation is unacceptable: a large part of spring crops are sown on spring plowed land, while the autumn plowing plan has not been completed year after year. The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies are instructed to ensure that starting from 1955, spring crops will be completely sown on autumn plowed and fallow lands, and winter crops, especially wheat, will be sown on deeply plowed and well-fertilized autumn plowed fallow lands, full fallow lands, and half-fallow lands, or on lands that have been cultivated in a timely manner after growing previous crops, but it is necessary to widely apply fertilizers to these lands in the spring for winter crops.

(4) The timely completion of the sowing of winter and spring crops in the most appropriate agricultural technical period is the primary task of party organizations, Soviet bodies, agricultural agencies, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee requests the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies to ensure that all collective farms and state farms adopt advanced experience and complete the sowing of winter and spring crops in the most appropriate agricultural technical period in each region.

(5) Sowing high-yielding and high-quality seeds, strictly following the sowing norms, and improving seed cultivation work are important conditions for increasing the yield per unit area. The task of party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies is to ensure that within the next two to three years, all regions, territories, and union republics will transition to sowing with the highest-yielding and highest-quality seeds that have been tested in regional trials.

To accelerate the increase in high-quality seeds of buckwheat, legumes, and millet, in 1954, in addition to the seed cultivation farms of the regions, it is necessary to organize the work of increasing the seeds of the above crops in advanced collective farms and state farms.

(6) Given the decisive role of machine-tractor stations in ensuring a good harvest, the Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee requests party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies, and all personnel of machine-tractor stations to resolutely improve the quality of tractor work. It is necessary to increase the responsibility of experts in machine-tractor stations, especially the chief agronomists as state inspectors, in ensuring the timely completion of work and the quality of work. The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the ministries of agriculture of the union republics, and the agricultural administrations of the territories and regions are instructed to primarily assess the completion of the tasks of the yield per unit area and the total harvest of grain and other crops assigned by the state when evaluating the work of machine-tractor stations. The yield should be the main standard for measuring the quality of work of machine-tractor stations.

(7) The Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee requests local party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies to correct the attitude of not paying enough attention to the use of organic and mineral fertilizers, as the use of these fertilizers is the most important way to further increase the yield per unit area. The correct and widespread use of local fertilizers can increase the grain production of 1954-1955 by several billion poods.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR, the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR, and their local bodies are instructed to ensure a significant increase in the accumulation and use of local fertilizers (manure, peat, mixed fertilizers, and other fertilizers), the widespread use of bacterial fertilizers, the improvement of the use of mineral fertilizers, the widespread use of machinery to extract peat and lime, the widespread use of machinery to transport and apply manure, peat, and other local fertilizers, so that the preparation, transportation, and application of local fertilizers in collective farms and state farms can be basically mechanized in the next two to three years.

Title: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on the Further Development of Agriculture in the USSR
Author:
Date: 1954-03-06
Page: 1

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has issued a directive on the further development of agriculture in the USSR. The directive emphasizes the need for increased agricultural production to meet the growing demands of the Soviet people and the national economy. Below is the full text of the directive:

The Central Committee of the CPSU notes that in the post-war years, the sowing area and total harvest of sugar beets, cotton, and oil-bearing crops have increased significantly, making it possible to increase the production of cotton fabrics, sugar, and vegetable oils. However, the current level of production of industrial raw materials is still far from meeting the increased demands of the national economy and the needs of the people.

To further increase the production of industrial raw material crops and ensure the necessary increase in consumption, to increase the raw material base for light and food industries, the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the USSR Ministry of Food Industry, the regional party committees, the party committees of the autonomous republics, the executive committees of the republics, the executive committees of the regions, the executive committees of the autonomous regions, and the executive committees of the autonomous oblasts to ensure a significant increase in the yield per unit area and, as needed, an expansion of the sowing area of these crops over the next two to three years.

In the cotton-growing regions, it is necessary to significantly expand the sowing area of cotton, increase the yield per unit area and total yield in the collective farms and state farms of the Central Asian republics and the southern Caucasus irrigation zones, in Kazakhstan, and in the most suitable areas for cotton cultivation in the Ukrainian SSR, the Russian SFSR, the Moldavian SSR, and other regions. It is necessary to bring back into agricultural production previously cultivated but later abandoned irrigation lands.

The initiative of the party organizations and Soviet bodies of the Uzbek SSR to use unused irrigation lands for cotton cultivation is approved.

The USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the local party organizations, and the Soviet bodies of the cotton-growing regions of Central Asia, the southern Caucasus, and southern Kazakhstan are instructed to strive for the implementation of cotton-alfalfa crop rotation in all cotton-growing collective farms by 1954-1958, to strictly monitor the use of water by the collective farms, to widely adopt more advanced methods of crop irrigation, and to fundamentally improve the work of soil improvement in the irrigation zones over the next two to three years. It is necessary to carry out the necessary work to repair existing canals and build new ones, and in the future, it is forbidden to allow the salinization and abandonment of irrigated lands.

The USSR Ministry of Light Industry and the councils of ministers of the republics managing the cotton-growing regions are instructed to take measures to improve the material and technical base of the cotton cleaning factories and their procurement network.

In the production of fiber flax and hemp, the Central Committee of the CPSU notes that the production of fiber flax and hemp is in an unacceptable state of neglect. In the flax-growing regions and republics, the majority of collective farms have consistently low flax yields, the procurement plans for flax products are not being fulfilled, and the collective farms themselves cannot ensure an adequate supply of seeds. Over the past three years, the sowing area of flax has decreased by 35%. The total harvest of fiber flax cannot meet the industrial demand for flax raw materials.

The USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the party organizations, and the Soviet bodies have tolerated this situation and have not taken the necessary measures to increase yields, eliminate backwardness, and further develop the production of flax and hemp. The USSR Ministry of Light Industry has not taken the necessary measures to introduce industrial methods of processing flax and hemp stems in production. The USSR Ministry of Machine Building has been slow in the production of new machines for the mechanization of flax and hemp production.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the local party organizations, the Soviet bodies, and the agricultural bodies of the flax and hemp producing regions to take measures to significantly expand the sowing area of fiber flax and hemp and to increase the yield per unit area of these crops.

The USSR State Planning Commission and the USSR Ministry of Agriculture are instructed to draft, within one month, a proposal on measures to increase flax production and strengthen material incentives for collective farms and collective farmers to increase flax and hemp production, and submit it to the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

The USSR Ministry of Light Industry is instructed to ensure the construction of a sufficient number of flax stem processing workshops and flax threshing workshops.

In the sugar beet sector, given the need to significantly increase the supply of sugar to the population, it is necessary to expand the sowing area of sugar beets in the most favorable regions for their cultivation by at least 300,000 hectares over the next two to three years and to take measures to significantly increase the yield per unit area and total yield of sugar beets.

In the oil-bearing crops sector, to increase the production of vegetable oils, it is necessary, while significantly increasing the yield per unit area of oil-bearing crops, to primarily increase the sowing area of sunflowers, oil flax, and other oil-bearing crops in the Volga region, Kazakhstan, western Siberia, and the Urals by 500,000 to 600,000 hectares.

To increase the yield per unit area of oil-bearing crops, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the local party organizations, and the Soviet bodies are instructed to fully mechanize the cultivation of oil-bearing crops in all regions over the next two to three years. It is necessary to ensure that starting from 1954, the square-nest method is used for sowing sunflowers.

In the development of orcharding and viticulture, our country needs a rich supply of food, and it is necessary to significantly increase the production of valuable food products such as fruits, berries, and grapes.

However, many collective farms and state farms have orchards and vineyards that are in a state of neglect and are backward in agriculture. The orcharding in the collective farms and state farms of the Saratov, Penza, Kuybyshev, Gorky, Tula, and Tambov regions is particularly poorly managed, and the area of orchards in these places has decreased compared to pre-war levels. Regions traditionally known for fruit cultivation, such as Kursk, Oryol, Belgorod, Lviv, Crimea, Kazakh SSR, Uzbek SSR, Tajik SSR, Azerbaijan SSR, Georgian SSR, and Armenian SSR, also have unsatisfactory orcharding work. The development of fruit cultivation in the areas suitable for fruit trees near large cities and industrial centers, as well as in the gardens of collective farmers, workers, and employees, is also not significant.

The Central Committee of the CPSU considers the current state of orcharding and viticulture to be unacceptable and, therefore, sets the most important task of striving to increase the yield per unit area of orchards and vineyards, expanding the sowing area of fruits and nuts, increasing their total and commercial production, so that in the near future it will be possible to significantly increase the production of fruits, berries, and grapes to meet the growing demand.

The USSR State Planning Commission, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the USSR Ministry of Food Industry, and the USSR Ministry of Chemical Industry are instructed to draft, within one month, measures and proposals on the following two plans and submit them to the Council of Ministers of the USSR:

1. Ensure the supply of sufficient toxic chemicals and equipment to state farms and collective farms to eliminate pests in orchards and vineyards;
2. Further mechanize the planting and care of fruit and grape seedlings and ensure the supply of trellises.

To further develop the production of tea, citrus fruits, essential oil crops, and other crops, the Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the USSR Ministry of Food Industry, the party organizations and Soviet bodies of the Georgian SSR, the Azerbaijan SSR, the Krasnodar Territory, and other regions to take additional measures to increase the yield per unit area and quality of tea, citrus fruits, and essential oil crops, and to expand the sowing area of these crops. In the near future, it is necessary to mechanize tea picking.

The Central Committee of the CPSU notes that the USSR State Planning Commission, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, and some local party organizations and Soviet bodies have made serious mistakes in the actual work of establishing fodder bases for livestock farming. This is manifested in the insufficient attention paid to the production of fodder grains and succulent fodder crops. As a result, the public livestock sector of the collective farms has only received a small satisfaction of its demand for fodder grains, and the production of hay has not increased, although the area of grass sowing has increased. Without sufficient fodder grains and succulent fodder, it is impossible to imagine the development of a developed public livestock sector.

The production of succulent fodder is significantly lagging behind. The yield per unit area of silage, root crops, and melon fodder is very low, and the plans for silage storage are not being fulfilled every year. The sowing area of a high-nutrient fodder, corn, is still insufficient. Some collective farms do not sow silage crops but instead cut grass from meadows to make silage fodder, which is uneconomical and leads to the inability to fulfill the silage and hay procurement plans.

The production and procurement of roughage are also lagging behind the needs of livestock farming. In recent years, the average supply of roughage per head of livestock has significantly decreased. Due to the low yield of sown meadows and natural pastures, the production of hay is very low.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggests that the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the local party organizations, the Soviet bodies, and the agricultural bodies eliminate the phenomenon of insufficient attention to the production of fodder grains and succulent fodder crops for livestock farming, ensure the expansion of the sowing area of fodder grains and increase their yield per unit area, so as to ensure that the public livestock sector receives sufficient fodder grains and other concentrated fodder.

It is necessary to take measures to unconditionally fulfill the assigned tasks of storing succulent fodder. This can be done by expanding the sowing area of silage crops (especially corn), root crops, fodder beets, potatoes, and melon fodder, and increasing their yield per unit area, based on the economic and natural conditions of each region. It is necessary to organize the improvement of meadows and pastures.

Given that potatoes are a highly valuable fodder that can be used to significantly increase the milk yield of cows and to fatten pigs and poultry on a large scale in a short period, it is necessary to significantly increase the production of potatoes for fodder in the non-black soil regions, Siberia, the central black soil regions, and the forest-steppe and lowland-forest regions of the Ukrainian SSR, so that potatoes become an important fodder in the collective farms and state farms of these regions.

It is incorrect that the use of valuable waste from many sugar factories, alcohol production plants, wineries, and other food industry enterprises as fodder for fattening livestock is not being done well.

The USSR Ministry of Food Industry, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, and the USSR Ministry of Agriculture are instructed to take measures to establish livestock feeding stations to fully utilize the waste from food industry enterprises, such as alcohol sludge, sugar sludge, and potato waste.

To increase the procurement of high-quality silage fodder, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the local party organizations, and the Soviet bodies are instructed to build a large number of silage towers and silage pits on a large scale, and to convert combine harvesters unsuitable for harvesting grain to harvest silage crops.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggests that the USSR State Planning Commission, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the Ministry of Geology and Conservation of Mineral Resources, the Ministry of Construction, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR, the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek SSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kirghiz SSR, the Council of Ministers of the Turkmen SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Tajik SSR draft, within two months, a proposal on the development of new large seasonal pastures for livestock grazing (drilling wells and constructing watering facilities, building livestock sheds, and carrying out housing and cultural construction), and submit it to the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

It should be noted that the USSR State Planning Commission and the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, in drafting plans for livestock farming, have taken a routine approach in determining the tasks of increasing the number of livestock and improving their productivity, without fully utilizing the natural and economic conditions available for the development of livestock farming.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR State Planning Commission, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, and the USSR Ministry of State Farms to correct the errors made in planning the development of individual sectors of livestock farming and to more correctly distribute the number of livestock based on the characteristics of each economic region of the country, and to increase the production of meat, milk, wool, and other livestock products per 100 hectares of agricultural land.

The Central Committee of the CPSU believes that state farms play a significant role in implementing the tasks set by the Party and the government to rapidly increase production in all sectors of agriculture and create an abundance of agricultural products. State farms are large-scale state socialist farms equipped with advanced agricultural machinery, and therefore, it is completely possible to significantly increase production in the shortest possible time, to deliver more grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products to the state, and to become model profitable farms.

However, there are significant shortcomings in the work of state farms. State farms have large areas of land that are not being used well for agricultural and livestock farming, and the yield per unit area of crops is very low. Many state farms cannot fulfill the state plans for the development of agriculture, the cost of production is high, and there are significant losses. To this day, the state has received very little grain, meat, milk, wool, and other livestock products from state farms.

The Central Committee of the CPSU notes that the backwardness of many state farms and the lack of management of agricultural production, especially grain production, in state farms, is the result of the weak leadership of the USSR Ministry of State Farms, and its indifferent attitude towards the promotion of advanced experience. The USSR Ministry of State Farms has wasted land in the use of state farm land. The ministry has not planned the development of state farm production to increase the production of grain, industrial raw material crops, potatoes, vegetables, and to rapidly develop livestock farming. It is particularly unacceptable that the USSR Ministry of State Farms has allowed the significant reduction of the proportion of grain sowing in state farms, which is contrary to the interests of the state.

The most serious mistake of the USSR Ministry of State Farms is that it has allowed the waste of land near stud farms, where there are 5.4 million hectares of land, but only 275,000 hectares are used for grain cultivation. The most serious mistake of the USSR Ministry of State Farms is that it has allowed the significant reduction of the proportion of grain sowing in state farms, which is contrary to the interests of the state.

The USSR Ministry of State Farms does not take measures to strengthen state farms with qualified leaders and agricultural specialists, which is one of the main reasons for the serious backwardness of state farm production.

Many state farms do not follow the requirements of agronomists, allowing land to become overgrown, tolerating low-quality work, and not completing sowing, plowing fallow land, and autumn plowing on time. A significant portion of the land is sown with ordinary seeds. State farms rarely use organic and mineral fertilizers, and the scale of using lime to neutralize acidic soils is not large. Due to the inability to timely complete harvesting or poor harvesting, the harvest is significantly damaged. In state farms, advanced methods of crop cultivation, such as square-nest sowing of potatoes, vegetables, and other intertillage crops, narrow-row sowing of grain, and cross-sowing, as well as other advanced agricultural technologies that can increase the yield per unit area, are being introduced very slowly.

There are many significant shortcomings in the development of livestock farming. Many state farms cannot fulfill the state-assigned tasks of developing livestock farming and increasing the productivity of livestock products. A significant portion of state farms tolerate the death of livestock and the non-reproduction of livestock, causing significant losses to livestock farming. The productivity of livestock products is still very low, especially the production of wool, and pigs and cattle are underfed, resulting in low weight. Some state farms have very low milk yields from cows.

One of the main reasons for the unsatisfactory state of livestock farming in state farms is the serious backwardness in the production and procurement of fodder. The yield per unit area of fodder crops in state farms is very low. The scale of sowing potatoes and corn for livestock fodder is still insufficient.

The use of tractors and agricultural machinery in state farms is still unsatisfactory, the general production volume of tractors and combine harvesters is still very low, the machine downtime is high, which makes it impossible to complete the main agricultural operations on time and reduces the yield per unit area. Many state farms do not have machine repair shops, sheds for storing tractors and agricultural machinery, and open sheds.

There are also serious shortcomings in the organization and implementation of state farm construction. The construction funds allocated to state farms are not fully utilized every year. In state farms, there are no permanent construction workers, and construction work is seasonal, and almost no mechanization of construction work is carried out. This inevitably leads to the inability to complete the construction plans for production, residential, cultural, and living facilities, and state farms are extremely lacking in these facilities. The water supply to livestock farms and pastures in state farms is also very poor.

The work of state farms under the jurisdiction of the USSR Ministry of Food Industry and other departments and agencies is also plagued with significant shortcomings.

The Central Committee of the CPSU considers that the main task of the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the state farm departments of the union republics, certain departments and agencies with state farms, the party organizations and Soviet bodies of the regions, territories, and republics is to fundamentally improve the work of state farms, increase the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of livestock, and on this basis, in the next two to three years, ensure that at least 500 million poods of grain are delivered to the state, and significantly increase the delivery of meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products to the state. It is necessary to significantly reduce the cost of production and ensure that each state farm is profitable and becomes a model, commodity-rich farm.

State farms should play a major role in increasing grain production by cultivating fallow and virgin lands in the eastern and southeastern regions of the country, cultivating all unused lands in existing state farms, and significantly increasing the yield per unit area of grain. State farms, being large-scale, highly mechanized farms, have the complete ability to produce grain with the least amount of labor and supply the state with the cheapest grain.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR, the Council of Ministers of the Kirghiz SSR, the executive committees of the territories and regions, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kirghizia, the regional and district party committees of these republics, and the directors of state farms to increase the sowing area of wheat and millet in state farms by 430,000 hectares in 1954-1955, of which 230,000 hectares will be the cultivation of fallow land, virgin land, and other lands in existing state farms, and 200,000 hectares will be the cultivation of state lands.

It is necessary to organize new large-scale grain state farms in 1954-1955, specializing in the production of wheat, millet, oats, corn, and other grains, as well as a portion of sunflowers and oil flax, with all work fully mechanized. The basic production unit of the newly established state farms should be tractor field work brigades, equipped with tractors, combine harvesters, various agricultural machinery, mobile housing, tents, mobile repair shops, mobile kitchens, and fuel and water supply trucks for tractors.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggests that the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the local party organizations, and the Soviet bodies ensure the selection of experienced and most qualified state farm directors, engineers, technicians, agronomists, accountants, tractor brigade leaders, tractor drivers, and combine operators from existing state farms and send them to work in newly established grain state farms.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the party organizations, and the Soviet bodies to immediately take measures to strengthen state farms with qualified leaders and specialists, usually appointing people with higher agricultural education to the position of state farm director, appointing people with higher or secondary agricultural education to the position of department heads or livestock farm managers, and appointing people with higher specialized education to the position of first-class specialists in state farms.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the union republics, the party committees of the territories and regions should select some engineers and technicians from the industrial and other sectors of the national economy and send them to work in state farms, where they will serve as chief engineers, repair shop managers, and mechanical engineers of various departments or livestock farms.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggests that the USSR Ministry of State Farms eliminate the errors made in planning state farm production, draft the most rational measures for land use based on the situation of state farms in each natural economic region, and determine the correct coordination of departments.

It is necessary to review and approve the tasks of expanding the sowing area of grain and developing livestock product production in stud farms every month to more fully utilize all the land around stud farms.

The Central Committee of the CPSU suggests that the USSR Ministry of State Farms and the state farm departments of the union republics ensure the further mechanization of all production departments of state farms, fundamentally improve the use of machinery, widely build repair shops, sheds for storing machinery, open sheds, and livestock sheds. It is also necessary to expand the construction of residential, cultural, and living facilities.

Each state farm and stud farm should usually have a qualified repair shop, a sufficient number of sheds for storing tractors, combine harvesters, and various agricultural machinery, open sheds and asphalted areas, a fuel station, a garage, and a warehouse for storing spare parts and materials.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of State Farms and the state farm departments of the union republics to take additional measures to successfully implement the tasks set by the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU regarding the development of livestock farming in state farms.

For this purpose, it is necessary to:

1. Ensure the increase in the reproduction rate of livestock and the protection of grown and young livestock, rapidly increase the number of cows and improve their milk yield;
2. Significantly expand pig farming, and by 1956, deliver 450,000 tons of pork to the state, widely using silage potatoes and corn, as well as waste from the food industry;
3. With the increase in the number of sheep, take measures to increase the wool production of sheep, and in the next two to three years, increase the number of fine-wool and semi-fine-wool sheep;
4. Ensure that each state farm establishes a fixed fodder base for livestock farming, primarily by significantly expanding the sowing area of corn for threshing and silage, potatoes for fodder, sugar beets, Sudan grass, and other high-value and high-yielding fodder crops based on the natural conditions of each region, and widely improving the work of natural meadows and pastures.

The Central Committee of the CPSU attaches great importance to fundamentally improving the work of state farms and rapidly increasing state farm production, and therefore instructs the party central committees of the union republics, the party committees of the territories and regions, and the district party committees to pay more attention to the leadership of state farms, strengthen the supervision of state farm work, and take measures to strengthen state farms with qualified cadres. Party organizations are responsible for constantly strengthening the party organizations of state farms so that they can play a greater role and take on greater responsibilities in further increasing state farm production, strengthening political work, and improving the cultural facilities of state farm workers.

The tasks set by the Party and the government for agriculture are complex and extremely important, requiring party organizations and Soviet bodies to provide more skilled and in-depth leadership for all sectors of agricultural production and to be able to organize the masses to solve the fundamental problems of agricultural growth.

The Central Committee of the CPSU notes that the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the party organizations, and the Soviet bodies have been extremely slow in overcoming the shortcomings in agricultural leadership exposed by the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU.

There is a harmful, bureaucratic method of work in agricultural leadership, where the leadership and specialists of the agencies do not use their main efforts for concrete and lively work—organizing collective farmers, machine-tractor stations, and state farm workers to implement the resolutions of the Party and the government on further developing agriculture—but instead spend their time drafting countless instructions, resolutions, documents, letters, reports, and other documents that are often useless to anyone, thus preventing Party and Soviet workers and specialists from directly engaging in organizational work in machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms.

The erroneous, high-handed, bureaucratic leadership methods of the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and the USSR Ministry of State Farms have infected local agricultural agencies and machine-tractor stations, which have also filled collective farms and state farms with unnecessary reports and various unnecessary documents.

The Central Committee of the CPSU demands that the USSR Ministry of Agriculture, the USSR Ministry of State Farms, the regional party committees, the territorial party committees, and the party central committees of the union republics eliminate the serious shortcomings in the work of agricultural agencies, root out the harmful bureaucratic and paper-pushing methods of leadership in agriculture, reduce the exchange of reports and documents, establish organic links with collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, increase the sense of responsibility of workers, and focus their efforts on actually helping collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to master advanced production experience and successfully complete their tasks.

Some regions have been slow and often formalistic in implementing the instructions of the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU on reorganizing the work of district party committees and district executive committees. In many places, the machine-tractor station work groups led by the district party committee secretary have not yet started working. In many regions and republics, when forming work groups, attention was not paid to including those who have received good training, understand their tasks, are familiar with collective farm production, and love the work of the Party.

Many district party committees still work in the old way, the district party committee secretaries and instructors responsible for machine-tractor stations still live in the district center, spending most of their time in the district center, rarely going to machine-tractor stations and collective farms, not getting involved in their lives, and not providing the necessary help.

In some regions, territories, and republics, the work of strengthening the district party committees and district executive committees with experienced, knowledgeable, and capable cadres who can correctly and skillfully lead collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms has been done poorly.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the regional party committees, the territorial party committees, and the party central committees of the union republics to complete the reorganization of agricultural district party committees in the shortest possible time, organize the work of district party committee secretaries and other workers in machine-tractor station regions, so that it is not just in form but in reality to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible for the leadership of machine-tractor stations and collective farms, root out the bureaucratic methods of work and the habit of holding empty meetings, so that these work groups can carry out constant political, organizational, and cultural-educational work in collective farms and machine-tractor stations, and come into contact with every collective farmer and every worker in machine-tractor stations.

Measures should be taken to strengthen the party organizations and Soviet bodies at the district level with qualified cadres, by selecting excellent workers from the party organizations and Soviet bodies of the regions, territories, and republics, and from cities and industrial centers, and sending them to work in agricultural district party committees and district executive committees.

The Central Committee of the CPSU believes that one of the most important conditions for completing the tasks set for agriculture is to further strengthen collective farms organizationally and economically.

The collective farm system is an advanced social system. Collective farms have unlimited potential for increasing agricultural production. However, to fully realize this potential, it is necessary to significantly improve the leadership of collective farms and raise all collective farms to the level of advanced farms.

We still have many backward collective farms that lack proper labor discipline, poor labor organization, low labor productivity, and do not use the land as owners, resulting in very little agricultural production.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the party central committees of the union republics, the territorial party committees, the regional party committees, and the district party committees, the councils of ministers of the union republics, the executive committees of the territories, regions, and districts, the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and its local agencies to systematically and deeply strengthen collective farms organizationally and economically. It is necessary to take measures to significantly strengthen labor discipline in collective farms, improve labor organization, resolutely implement advanced production norms in agricultural work, continuously increase the labor productivity of collective farms, rationally use collective farm land, and obtain more agricultural products from every hectare of agricultural land.

Only on this basis can the total agricultural production and the production of commercial agricultural products be gradually increased, the public wealth of collective farms be increased, and the material well-being of collective farmers be improved year by year.

Party organizations, Soviet bodies, and agricultural agencies should pay special attention to promoting the experience of advanced collective farms and agricultural production innovators in all collective farms.

Many party organizations and Soviet bodies have not taken the necessary measures to strengthen the ranks of collective farm chairmen. A part of the collective farms need to strengthen their leadership. Under the current conditions, the role of the collective farm chairman has become immeasurably important, and whether the tasks assigned by the Party to the collective farms can be successfully completed depends primarily on the collective farm chairman.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the district party committees, the regional party committees, the territorial party committees, and the party central committees of the union republics to ensure that the leaders of each collective farm are experienced and skilled managers who can manage large-scale collective farms.

To increase the responsibility of local party organizations for the correct selection, assignment, and training of collective farm leaders, the appointment and dismissal of collective farm chairmen must be recorded with the regional party committees, the territorial party committees, and the party central committees of the union republics, while the appointment and dismissal of deputy chairmen, brigade leaders, and livestock farm managers must be recorded with the district party committees.

It should be noted that the current system of training collective farm leaders—the three-year agricultural school for training collective farm chairmen—is not up to the task. The main recruits of this school are young people who have graduated from incomplete secondary schools and have no experience in agricultural leadership, while those with rich practical experience but without the necessary general education cannot enter this school.

The Central Committee of the CPSU instructs the USSR Ministry of Agriculture and the USSR Ministry of Culture to submit, within one month, a proposal to the Council of Ministers of the USSR on how to train collective farm chairmen from practical workers who have not received the necessary education.

The Central Committee of the CPSU notes that some Party and Soviet leaders, including some Party regional committee secretaries and some chairmen of regional Soviet executive committees, do not understand agriculture and do not study the basic knowledge of agricultural production. This seriously affects the level of leadership of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms. Now, a task is set for Party and Soviet cadres related to agricultural production: to master the basic knowledge of agricultural management and to be familiar with the methods used by advanced agricultural workers.

The Central Committee of the CPSU believes that the reclamation of virgin and fallow lands is of great national significance for significantly increasing grain production, and therefore instructs the Party, trade union, and Komsomol organizations to carry out propaganda work among rural mechanization workers, specialists, and agricultural leaders to attract volunteers to engage in permanent land reclamation work. Propaganda work must use newspapers, radio, film, and other propaganda and agitation tools. The Central Committee of the CPSU calls on collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, and state farm workers to actively participate in land reclamation work.

To complete the tasks set by the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU and this Plenum for further developing agriculture, it is necessary to resolutely strengthen political work in rural areas. Party organizations should strive to make all rural laborers, collective farm members, state farm and machine-tractor station workers, and agricultural specialists deeply understand the tasks of further increasing agricultural production and selflessly work at their posts to complete these tasks. It is necessary to more widely attract our rural intellectuals, teachers, doctors, agronomists, livestock specialists, and engineers to engage in political work and mass cultural work. This is a great force that can and should become the backbone of party organizations.

The Central Committee of the CPSU calls on all party members and Komsomol members in rural areas, all collective farmers, and workers of machine-tractor stations and state farms to widely carry out socialist competition, strive to significantly increase grain production, strive for a bumper harvest of all crops, strive to increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of livestock products.

    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议
    就赫鲁晓夫的“关于进一步扩大苏联的谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地”的报告通过的决议
    ——一九五四年三月二日
    一、
    苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议规定全国当前最迫切的任务是：在社会主义工业强大发展的基础上，在今后两三年内充分满足苏联人民对消费品日益增长的需要，并保证供应轻工业和食品工业以原料。根据全体会议的决议，党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关在过去这一时期内做了许多工作，为完成大大发展农业各部门这一任务创造了必要的条件。
    为执行苏共中央九月全体会议的决议，集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，比前几年更好地完成了他们的秋季田间工作。和一九五二年相比，一九五三年秋季集体农庄和国营农场多翻耕了一千三百万公顷的秋耕地，多翻耕了三百五十万公顷的休闲地。在大多数共和国、边疆区和州，都更加紧凑地并在更合乎农业技术要求的时限内，完成了冬季作物的播种和一九五四年春播前的整地工作。
    由于执行了苏共中央九月全体会议的决议以及党和政府在一九五三年，特别是在下半年跟着采取的一些决议，农民的收入大大增加了。国家一面把农民需要购买的货物的零售价格平均降低了百分之十一，一面大大提高了集体农庄和集体农民义务交售给国家的肉类、奶类、羊毛、马铃薯和蔬菜的征购价格。现在已实行国家收购肉类、奶类、蔬菜、马铃薯的制度，收购价格要高出征购价格很多。集体农庄过去在义务交售牲畜产品、马铃薯和蔬菜方面的欠数一律取消。集体农民私人副业的义务交售标准降低了，集体农民的农业税减少了，过去几年积欠的农业税尾数完全免收。此外，集体农民私人副业过去几年在向国家义务交售牲畜产品和马铃薯方面的一切欠数一律取消。由于集体农庄和集体农民的义务交售额降低了，他们就可以把大量的商品产物按较高的收购价格卖给国家。由于实行了以上在经济上鼓励集体农庄和集体农民的措施以及在税收政策方面的一些措施，一九五三年集体农庄和集体农民的收入就增加了一百三十余亿卢布。
    坚持不渝地遵守集体农庄和集体农民在发展农业生产中的物质利益的原则，应该是而且今后将是党组织和苏维埃机关经常关心的事情。
    鉴于决定各种国民经济措施的成败的是人，是干部，党为了实现全体会议的决议，首先注意干部问题，尤其是机器拖拉机站的干部问题。苏共中央全体会议后，分配了约一百二十五万名拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队队长、复杂的农业机器操使者及其他工作人员到机器拖拉机站去从事固定工作。约有五万名机械师响应党的号召，从工业和其他国民经济部门中回到机器拖拉机站去。
    最近几个月中向机器拖拉机站派了十万余名农艺师和饲畜师为集体农庄服务。约有两万三千名工程师和技术人员从工业和其他国民经济部门调到机器拖拉机站去工作。因此，机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的专家的阵容大大加强了。专家干部更加接近对农业生产具有决定意义的地方。
    但是，在向机器拖拉机站和集体农庄补充熟练干部的工作中有着巨大的缺点。党组织和苏维埃机关的某些领导工作人员大概没有理解到：不解决干部问题就不能保证农业各部门的急速高涨。
    在许多机器拖拉机站中，特别是在奥勒尔、库尔斯克、加里宁等州的许多机器拖拉机站中，直到现在还没有选定大量的固定干部列入机器拖拉机站的编制。有不小一部分工人表面上是机器拖拉机站编制内的人员，但是尽管冬季有大量工作要作，他们却不在机器拖拉机站和集体农庄中工作。机器拖拉机站固定工人的劳动，组织得不好。布利安斯克州、乌拉季米尔州及其他一些州没有很好地展开工作，去动员那些到工业和其他国民经济部门工作的机器操使干部重返机器拖拉机站。培养机器操使干部的工作有着巨大的缺点：许多机械化学校和培养这类干部的训练班名额不足，有些学校和训练班的教学内容是脱离农业生产的迫切任务的。党组织、苏维埃机关、农业机关以及机器拖拉机站站长和国营农场场长，必须改进教育工作，使机器操使干部更好地学习先进的农作物培植方法，研究新的技术和掌握新的业务。在一些州、边疆区和共和国中，在选拔和配置农业专家的工作中存在有严重的缺点。往往是首先派专家到各城市或区中心附近的机器拖拉机站或集体农庄去，而最边远的机器拖拉机站和集体农庄直到现在还得不到领导干部和专家的补充。最有经验的专家往往被派到先进的集体农庄去，而那些经济上薄弱的、最需要干练的帮助的集体农庄，得到的反而是经验较少的农艺师和饲畜师。有些机器拖拉机站没有给参加工作的专家们准备好必要的住所和生活条件。
    党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关在选拔农业干部的工作中尚未解决的最重要的问题，是选拔集体农庄主席的问题。只有很少一部分党组织采取了一些办法来加强集体农庄的领导干部。而大多数州、边疆区和共和国显然对这件重要事情估计不足。可是，进一步提高和全面发展集体农庄的公有经济，在很大程度上取决于选拔集体农庄主席的工作。事实证明：如果领导集体农庄的是一个积极主动的主席，他精通自己的工作并善于组织群众，那么一个最落后的农庄在两三年内也可变成先进的农庄，庄员也可以从劳动日获得高的收入。在这样的集体农庄中，国家和全民的利益与集体农庄和集体农民的利益正确地结合起来了。反过来说，如果领导集体农庄的是马马虎虎挑选出来的、不会管理社会主义大生产的人，那么即使有着丰富的生产潜力的集体农庄也要开始落后和衰退。
    在哈萨克共和国、阿尔泰边疆区、加里宁州、高尔基州、契卡洛夫州、倭罗格达州、诺夫哥罗德州、普斯科夫州、奥勒尔州、布利安斯克州和鞑靼自治共和国中，苏共中央九月全体会议关于加强集体农庄领导干部的决议执行得特别不好。
    苏共中央全体会议要求党组织、苏维埃机关、农业机关，要求机器拖拉机站站长纠正对选拔集体农庄领导干部不负责任的态度，并用行动解决从组织上和经济上加强集体农庄这一根本问题。
    　苏共中央九月全体会议通过了加强社会主义农业的物质生产基础的广泛纲领。我国的工业单是在一九五三年第四季为执行全体会议的决议，就供给农业以四万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），一万一千余台谷物收割联合机，二万二千余台拖拉机牵引播种机，数千台拖拉机牵引割草机和其他头等机器。在强大的重工业的基础上，我国的农业所获得的现代化的机器越来越多，越来越快。到一九五四年年初，机器拖拉机站共拥有一百余万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），其中包括四十六万台柴油拖拉机，二十七万台谷物收割联合机，约四十五万台拖拉机牵引谷物播种机，二十六万余台拖拉机牵引割草机和其他许多改良了的机器。
    苏共中央全体会议同时指出，机器制造工业部的领导人和一些工厂的厂长对委托给他们的制造农业机器的任务执行得不能令人满意，他们在这一问题上表现了非国家的态度。一九五三年没有完成
  “贝拉鲁斯”式拖拉机的生产计划。“CKL—四”式马铃薯栽种机的生产任务完成了百分之五十九，“KOK—二”式马铃薯收获联合机完成了百分之三十八，“KOH—二·八”式拖拉机牵引中耕机完成了百分之八十九。一九五三年第四季度，生产“COH—二·八”式蔬菜播种机的任务总共只完成百分之六十。“CPH—四”式植苗机完成了百分之十三，“KPH—二·八”式中耕追肥机完成了百分之六十。机器制造工业部与运输和重型机器制造工业部所属许多企业的领导人，对不断地供给机器拖拉机站以全部备件这件事采取了不负责任的态度。
    苏联农业部、某些州、边疆区和共和国的地方苏维埃机关以及农业机关进行机器拖拉机站建设的情形不能令人满意。一九五三年修配厂建设计划只完成百分之五十七，保存农业机器的机库和敞棚的建设只完成百分之七十。
    由于党和政府采取了一些措施以物质鼓励集体农庄和集体农民发展公有饲畜业的兴趣，派遣了许多农业专家到集体农庄去工作，机器拖拉机站对集体农庄的冬季保养牲畜工作给予了组织工作上和技术上的援助，同时由于将计算牲畜的日期由一月一日改到十月一日，农庄中牲畜的饲养管理的情形稍有改善。一九五三年，肉类、奶类和羊毛的征购和收购工作做得比一九五二年好。可是，集体农庄一九五三年没有完成国家发展饲畜业中增加牛和绵羊数目的计划。储藏饲料的计划没有完成。粗饲料征购得比一九五二年少。在许多州、边疆区和共和国中，特别是在利森、坦波夫、普斯科夫、科斯特罗马、图拉、诺夫哥罗德、奥勒尔、雅罗斯拉夫等地，一九五三年第四季度牛的头数大大减少了。
    为了执行苏共中央九月全体会议的决议，各加盟共和国党中央、边疆区党委会和州党委会，已开始加强党在乡村中的政治工作。党的区一级机构已开始改组它们的工作，以便更密切地关怀集体农庄和国营农场的生产。已经成立了一些由区党委书记领导的指导组，直接在机器拖拉机站和集体农庄中进行党的政治工作。
    但是，农业管理机构以及农村中党的政治工作的改组进行得极慢，这就严重阻碍了经济任务的解决，因为如果不根本改进对集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导，不认真地提高农村中党的政治工作和组织工作的水平，就不可能胜利地把农业向前推进。
  二、谷物生产现状和增加
      谷物生产的任务
      （一）为了完成党和政府所提出的、急速提高全国日用品生产的全民任务，进一步发展作为整个农业生产的基础的谷物，就具有特别重要的意义。
    更加充分地满足居民对质量高的食品不断增长的需求，首先取决于增产谷物。要在极短的时期内解决饲畜业的问题，就要保证所有的牲畜能获得足够的饲料谷物——玉蜀黍、大麦和燕麦。在植棉地区中和植麻地区中，由于工业原料作物生产的增加，由于城市和工业中心附近蔬菜、马铃薯和饲畜业基地的发展，对这些地区的居民也就需要供给更多的粮食。
    社会主义的计划性的国民经济，要建立国家的粮食储备，并且要使之每年改善。此外，国家应当掌握余粮来扩充日益增加的出口量。
    由此可见，进一步发展其他各农业部门，满足居民和整个国民经济不断增加的需求，就取决于谷物发展的成绩如何。
    在这方面，党中央委员会全体会议认为，现有的谷物生产水平，无论就其生产总量和商品产量来说，都不能满足国民经济不断增长的需要。国家掌握的谷物数量和谷物需求量不相适应。集体农庄在完成对国家的义务后剩下来的谷物，也不能满足集体农庄公有经济的一切需求；许多集体农庄庄员的劳动日谷物报酬很低。饲料谷物剩下的更少，而没有饲料谷物，饲畜业就不可能有急速的提高。
      （二）党中央委员会全体会议认为，目前谷物的发展水平和国家现阶段对粮食不断增长的需求之所以不相适应，原因是很多的。
    虽然，一九五三年的播种总面积比一九四○年增加了六百八十万公顷，而谷物的播种面积却缩小了三百八十万公顷，饲料谷物（玉蜀黍、大麦、燕麦）的播种面积大大缩小了，即缩小了六百八十万公顷，像黍、荞麦、稻子这样一类制米作物的播种面积缩小了一百三十万公顷，豆类的播种面积缩小了八十万公顷。
    虽然，苏联社会主义农业是世界上机械化程度最高的农业，农业中的最新式的机器每年都在不断增加，可是目前采用的农业技术措施的水平，还不能保证在所有的土地上获得谷物的丰收。苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部和它们的地方机关、许多机器拖拉机站、国营农场及集体农庄，不注意培育谷物的农业技术，没有完成休闲地和秋耕地的翻耕任务，降低了播种定额，拖延了播种和收割的期限，使收获遭到巨大的损失。
    目前谷物生产发展水平之所以落后于居民及国民经济对粮食的不断增长的需求，基本原因之一是：苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部在计划播种面积、特别是计划谷物和牧草的播种面积时犯了严重的错误。由于墨守成规地采用牧草作物轮种制，而不考虑国内各区域的特点，因此，乌克兰、北高加索、伏尔加河流域和中央黑土地带各区的谷物播种面积减少了。
    这种错误的计划工作使我国谷物的发展遭到了巨大的损失。
      （三）苏共中央全体会议认为，目前国家的任务是，急速提高粮食谷物、饲料谷物、制米作物和豆类的生产，使国家征购和收购的粮食在今后几年内比一九五三年增加百分之三十五到四十。
    我们的农业是用大量的头等机器装备起来的，因此有可能使所有的主要农业工作都机械化。现在我们有着领导社会主义大生产——机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场的必要的领导干部。有农业专家和农业机器操使者大军在为农业生产服务。最后，苏维埃国家还拥有丰富的土地。
    由此可见，我们的社会主义农业具备一切可能来大力提高谷物生产。
  三、开垦生荒地和熟荒地是
      增加谷物生产的巨大后
        备力量
      （一）苏共中央全体会议认为，除了提高全国各地区谷物的单位面积产量以外，开垦新地对增加谷物的生产也有巨大的意义。短期内增加谷物生产的重要的、而且完全现实的后备力量，就是扩大谷物播种面积，即在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域等地区及北高加索的一部分地区开垦熟荒地和生荒地。这些地区有大片尚未开垦的黑色和褐色的肥沃土地，这些土地不须再作多大的投资就可以得到丰收。
    西伯利亚、哈萨克的集体农庄和国营农场的工作经验证明，从每公顷开垦的生荒地和熟荒地上收十四到十五公担的春小麦是完全可能的，先进农场每公顷还可以收二十至二十五公担或二十五公担以上。譬如，车里雅宾斯克州的“彼得罗巴夫罗夫斯克”国营农场，一九五三年在一万九千公顷土地
  （其中有一万公顷是近年来新开垦的土地）上每公顷平均收二十二公担小麦。北哈萨克斯坦州科纽霍夫斯克区的“列宁之路”集体农庄，每公顷春小麦的平均实际收获量为十四点五公担，在三百五十公顷新开垦的生荒地上每公顷收三十公担。
    苏共中央全体会议向苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部，向哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索的各级党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关，向这些地区的机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场，提出一项最重要的国家任务，即在一九五四—一九五五年至少开垦一千三百万公顷的熟荒地和生荒地以扩大谷物播种面积，在一九五五年要从这些土地上收获十一亿到十二亿普特的谷物，其中要有八亿到九亿的商品谷物。
      （二）责成哈萨克共和国共产党中央委员会，西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索的州党委会和边疆区党委会，苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部，俄罗斯联邦部长会议，哈萨克共和国部长会议，上述各地区的州执行委员会、边疆区执行委员会，机器拖拉机站站长、国营农场场长，增加集体农庄和国营农场的播种面积：根据国民经济计划，一九五四年小麦和黍的播种面积应增加二百三十万公顷，其中集体农庄的是一百八十万公顷，国营农场的是五十万公顷；一九五五年谷物的播种面积至少还要增加一千零七十万公顷。
    一九五五年在新开垦的土地上，一般是在做过很好的整地工作的休闲地和早期秋耕地上播种谷物。
      （三）苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议、哈萨克共和国部长会议、地方苏维埃机关和农业机关应及时地，但不得迟于一九五四年六月一日，首先选择和划出最肥沃的熟荒地和生荒地、居民区附近的长草很少的割草场和牧场，用来扩大集体农庄和国营农场中的谷物播种面积。同时利用国家土地来组织新的谷物国营农场，并增加国营农场和集体农庄的田地。
      （四）为了及时进行新田地的翻耕、播种前的整地工作、谷物的播种和收割，以及花费最少的劳动力而得到谷物，必须保证谷物的培植和耕作的一切工作完全机械化。
    为了完成开垦熟荒地和生荒地以及耕耘长草很少的草地、牧场的工作，和进一步增加小麦播种面积，一九五四年将把十二万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、一万台联合机、相应数量的拖拉机牵引犁、播种机、重型圆盘耙、中耕机和其他农业机器运到新开垦的地区。为了进行技术服务，要向机器拖拉机站供给必要数量的汽车、活动修配场、修理场、油槽车、固定油罐、工具和装备。
      （五）党中央委员会全体会议要求所有的党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关注意：开垦熟荒地和生荒地工作的顺利完成，首先取决于正确地选派熟练的领导者、工程技术干部和农业专家干部到新开垦的地区，并选派机器操使干部，把他们列入这些地区的机器拖拉机站和国营农场的拖拉机工作队编制中。
    党中央委员会全体会议认为保证机器拖拉机站和国营农场的人力是刻不容缓的措施，因此必须从现有的机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员中调派熟练干部到开垦新地的机器拖拉机站和国营农场中去，同时还要在农业机械化专科学校、农业机械化学校和机器拖拉机站所属的训练班中以及国营农场中，训练拖拉机手和联合机手来补充所需要的干部。新开垦地区的新国营农场所缺少的人力，应有组织地进行补充。
    苏共中央全体会议为各加盟共和国党中央、边疆区党委会和州党委会、各加盟共和国部长会议、边疆区执行委员会和州执行委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部以及各级党组织、工会组织和青年团组织规定的任务是：在广泛进行宣传的基础上，一九五四年选派领导工作人员、专家和熟练的工作人员到开垦新地的国营农场和机器拖拉机站去。不仅应从现有的机器拖拉机站和国营农场中调拨人员，而且还要从工业和国民经济的其他部门中抽调。应当把向新开垦的地区调拨人员的工作看作是执行党和政府的重要任务，看作是一件爱国大事。
    每一个企业、机关和组织都应当把调派本单位愿到新开垦地区工作的专家和熟练工人，看作是光荣的责任。
      （六）批准苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和地方青年团组织关于从团员和青年中动员十万名机器操使者自愿到开垦新地的机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作的倡议。
      （七）凡是从其他的机器拖拉机站、国营农场、工业企业和组织调到开垦熟荒地和生荒地地区的机器拖拉机站、国营农场和征购机关工作的工程师、技师、农艺师、饲畜师和其他农业专家、拖拉机手、联合机手、熟练的修理工人、会计员和其他工作人员，一律一次发给相当于三个月原职原薪的补助金，并根据劳动法典第八十二条，付给调职人员旅费。
      （八）为了保证开垦新地的机器拖拉机站和国营农场拖拉机工作队的工作人员有必要的生活条件，责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关在一九五四年组织田间休息营，保证工作人员有居住、饮食和沐浴的活动房屋和帐棚，并组织公共食堂和水的供应。
    责成苏联贸易部和全苏消费合作社中央联合会广泛地利用流动商店，向拖拉机工作队售卖食品和消费品。
    苏联文化部和全苏工会中央理事会必须保证新开垦地区的机器拖拉机站和国营农场拖拉机工作队工作人员的文化生活（电影、无线电、报纸、杂志等）。苏联卫生部必须保证对这些工作人员的医疗服务。
      （九）为了在物质上鼓励集体农庄、集体农民和机器拖拉机站工作人员对执行开垦新地并使谷物丰收的计划的兴趣，特采取下列奖励办法：
      （1）建议集体农庄根据田间工作队和拖拉机工作队工作人员全体大会的决定，在新播种的土地上，凡是超过计划规定的单位面积收获量收割的粮食，得以其中百分之三十以下的数额作为额外报酬。
      （2）建议各集体农庄根据集体农民全体大会的决定，得预支给集体农民劳动日报酬，其数额可达国家对新开垦土地播种面积征购和收购的粮款的百分之二十五左右。
      （3）责成全苏消费合作社中央联合会按比例对各个向国家出售粮食的集体农庄销售工业品、载重汽车、自动拖车、电动机、建筑材料及其他生产用品和经济用品，这个比例就是：集体农庄每卖价值一百卢布的谷物，全苏消费合作社中央联合会即出售给集体农庄以零售价值达五十卢布的商品。
      （4）破例授权机器拖拉机站站长从各集体农庄实际交售给国家的每一公担谷物中额外扣除七十五戈比，用作对机器拖拉机站拖拉机工作队和特别工作队的奖赏。上述扣除款项用作奖赏的办法，只在生荒地和熟荒地谷物播种和实际收获量计划完成的情况下才适用。
    兹规定：在一九五四—一九五五年，把开垦熟荒地和生荒地的新国营农场的工人、职员、专家和领导人员的工资一律增加百分之十五。
    （十）苏共中央全体会议认为：增加谷物生产的任务，除了要求开垦哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索各地区的生荒地和熟荒地以外，还要求耕耘国内其他各区、特别是非黑土地带不曾使用的土地及长草很少的草地和牧场，清除灌木丛和丛林，排干沼泽地，从而大大扩大各区的播种面积。
    完成这些工作，就可以在最近几年内有一批新的肥沃土地投入生产，在国内工业高度发达的稠密居民区扩大谷物、蔬菜、马铃薯和饲料作物的播种面积，从而大大改善对城市和工业中心居民的新鲜蔬菜、马铃薯、奶类和肉类的供应。
    苏共中央全体会议指出在组织开垦非黑土地带的新地方面存在着的严重缺点。苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关竟把资金和物资分散用于许多小块开垦地上。由于这个原因，在开垦新的土地时无法使用工业方法来改良土壤，不能够保证全盘机械化，机器利用得不好，开垦每一公顷土地都得花费很大的人力、物力。
    必须根本改变开垦非黑土地带新地的工作，今后要集中改良土壤机器，来开垦大片土地，广泛地采用工业方法来进行工作。
      （十一）首先必须着手的工作是排干和开垦这样一些土地：麦晓尔低地（特别是利森州、乌拉季米尔州和莫斯科州各地区的低地）、乌克兰共和国的特鲁别什河的河滩地等。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议、乌克兰共和国部长会议、白俄罗斯共和国部长会议、拉脱维亚共和国部长会议、立陶宛共和国部长会议、爱沙尼亚共和国部长会议，在两个月内提出关于开垦大块熟荒地和沼泽地以供播种的建议，并为此成立专门的建筑机构和设计机构，并供给相应的物质技术设备，以便在最近时期内开始进行这项工作。
    凡是由于战争和个别集体农庄的能力薄弱而荒废的、而且开垦花费不大的土地，保证首先使其投入生产。
      （十二）党中央委员会全体会议指出：一九五四—一九五五年要在苏联东部和东南部各地区开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地和熟荒地，还要在苏联非黑土地带和其他地区开垦熟荒地和生荒地，这项工作只是利用尚未使用过的广大土地来增加谷物生产及其他农产品生产这项全国性的巨大工作的开端。
    要胜利地完成这一开垦生荒地和在熟荒地与生荒地上扩大谷物播种面积的计划，首先要依靠党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关对这一全民事业作具体的、有效的领导，依靠机器拖拉机站和国营农场在组织上和技术上所作的准备工作，以及依靠动员集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员执行上述任务的程度。
  四、关于农业的计划性、改
    变作物播种面积的比例和
    提高单位面积产量
    合理地利用播种面积和大大提高谷物的单位面积产量，对于胜利地解决大力提高谷物生产这一任务，具有重大的意义。
      （甲）关于扩大小麦、饲料谷物、
          制米作物和豆类的播种面积
      （一）苏共中央全体会议指出，现在的作物播种面积的比例状况证明：在采用牧草作物轮种制方面存在着考虑不周、经营不良和墨守成规的现象，没有考虑到我国各个不同地区的特点。苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部过去在农业计划方面采取了不正确的方针，这表现在下列两方面：一方面是在乌克兰共和国南部和摩尔达维亚共和国的干旱和半干旱地区、在北高加索以及我国东南部各地区不合理地扩大产量极低的多年生牧草的播种面积；另一方面是大大减少了谷物，特别是玉蜀黍、豆类、制米作物和饲料谷物的播种面积。这种不正确的计划的结果，使谷物的播种面积大大缩减了，使制米作物、豆类和饲料谷物的总产量减少了。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联南部和东南部各州、边疆区、各共和国的党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关采取措施，纠正在实行牧草作物轮种制中产生的错误，并改正作物播种面积的分配比例，以便从一九五四年开始减少产量很低的多年生牧草的播种面积，而大大增加谷物、特别是制米作物、豆类、饲料谷物的播种面积。
    （二）责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部会同各加盟共和国，在三个月内拟定关于一九五五年各地区（包括开垦熟荒地和生荒地及更充分地利用熟地在内）的作物播种面积分配比例的建议，并呈交苏联部长会议，这项建议的原则是要扩大谷物、豆类、制米作物、饲料谷物、玉蜀黍、甜菜、向日葵、棉花、纤维用亚麻、块根饲料、青储饲料等作物的播种面积及大大扩大果园和葡萄园的面积。
    （三）鉴于现在的农业计划制度中存在着严重的缺点，即计划的过分集中限制了集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场发展农业生产的主动性，责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部会同各加盟共和国在两个月内拟出关于改变农业的计划办法以便更大地发挥各地在计划农业生产中的主动性的建议，并呈交苏联部长会议。
    （乙）关于进一步提高谷物单位
          面积产量的措施
    （一）苏共中央全体会议提请各级党组织、苏维埃机关、农业机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场，特别重视大大提高谷物的单位面积产量的必要性，这一直是增加谷物生产的主要方法。
    社会主义经营制度使得有可能获得稳固的高度收成。全国各个不同地区的先进的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场年年获得丰收，它们的实际情况就证明了这一点。然而，全国有许多地区，由于严重破坏了培育谷物的农业技术规程，谷物的单位面积产量仍然很低。很大部分的播种工作是在春耕地上进行的，对谷物施放的地方肥料和矿质肥料数量极少，选种办法在许多州推广得很慢。非黑土地带的各地区几乎没有采用在酸性土壤中施加石灰的办法，在田地里极少施加厩肥、泥炭和其他地方肥料，而在这样一些不施加肥料的地区，即使机械化达到很高的水平，谷物也不会有很好的收成。
    （二）苏共中央全体会议建议各级党组织、苏维埃机关、农业机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场注意下列几个关于提高单位面积产量的问题：在生产中广泛采用农业技术方面的先进方法；改进拖拉机的使用；尽速采用和掌握正确的牧草作物轮种制；提高田间工作的质量并缩短田间工作的时间；改进选种工作；大大增加地方肥料（厩肥、泥炭等）的积肥量，并增加这种肥料的使用量，更好地利用矿质肥料，在酸性土壤中施加石灰和在咸性土壤中施加石膏；坚决消除谷物在收割、转运和保管时的耗损现象；有计划地消除农作物的病虫害。
    建议各共和国部长会议、各边疆区和各州执行委员会根据各地区的特点，拟出并确定各种作物必须遵守的起码的农业技术规程，其中包括：最适宜的播种时期，下种定额，休闲地的翻耕时期，冬季作物播种地的整地时期和冬季作物的播种时期，收割联合机收割时留下的草秸的收集工作，秋耕工作，保护冬季播下的种子不受损害的办法，以及其他措施。在这些规程中，应当规定违反必须遵守的农业技术规程所要担负的责任。
    责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部和全苏列宁农业科学院，在各加盟共和国部长会议、各边疆区和各州执行委员会拟订起码的必须遵守的农业技术规程时，给予帮助并提出意见。
      （三）在提高单位面积产量的措施中，及时地进行秋耕地和休闲地的翻耕工作具有头等重要的意义。下面这种情况是不能容忍的：很大一部分春播作物播种在春耕地上，而秋耕计划连年没有完成。责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关保证从一九五五年开始，将春播作物完全播种在秋耕地上和休闲地上，将冬播作物、特别是小麦，播种在经过深耕细作的和施肥充足的秋耕休闲地、全休闲地和半休闲地上，或者是播种在种过前耕作物但经过及时耕作的土地上，可是必须广泛地在春季对这些土地上的冬播作物追施肥料。
      （四）在最合乎农业技术要求的时期进行冬季和春季作物的播种工作，是党组织、苏维埃机关、农业机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的首要任务。苏共中央全体会议要求苏联农业部、苏联国营农场、党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关，设法使所有的集体农庄和国营农场采用先进的经验，在各个地区最合乎农业技术要求的时期，完成冬季和春季作物的播种工作。
      （五）播种收获量很高的优良种籽，完全遵照下种定额，改进种籽培植工作，这些是提高单位面积产量的重要条件。党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关的任务是：保证在最近两三年内，使所有的州、边疆区和加盟共和国过渡到用收获量最高的、质量最好的、经过分区试验的种籽来播种。
    为了加速增加优良的荞麦和豆类、黍的种籽，在一九五四年除各区种籽培育农场外，必须在先进的集体农庄和国营农场内组织增产上述作物种籽的工作。
    （六）鉴于机器拖拉机站在保证丰收方面具有决定性的作用，苏共中央全体会议要求党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关，要求所有机器拖拉机站的工作人员，坚决提高拖拉机工作的质量。必须提高机器拖拉机站中的专家，特别是作为国家检查人员的总农艺师在保证工作及时进行和工作质量方面的责任心。责成苏联农业部、各加盟共和国农业部以及各边疆区和州的农业管理处，在估计机器拖拉机站的工作时，应首先根据完成国家规定的谷物和其他农作物的单位面积产量和总收获量的任务的情况。收获量应当成为衡量机器拖拉机站工作质量的主要标准。
    （七）苏共中央全体会议要求地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关纠正不重视使用有机肥料和矿质肥料的态度，因为使用这些肥料乃是进一步提高单位面积产量的最重要的办法。正确和广泛地使用地方肥料，就可以使一九五四—一九五五年的粮食产量增加数亿普特。
    责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部及其地方机关保证大大增加地方肥料（厩肥、泥炭、混合肥料及其他肥料）的积存量和使用量，广泛使用细菌肥料，改进矿质肥料的使用，广泛使用机器开采泥炭和石灰，广泛使用机器运送和施加厩肥、泥炭和其他地方肥料，使集体农庄和国营农场的地方肥料的准备、运送和施加工作在今后两三年内基本上能够机械化。
    应当特别注意非黑土地带肥料的使用，这些地区必须在土壤中施加厩肥、泥炭和磷灰，扩大羽扇豆及其他绿肥作物的播种面积，以及在酸性土壤中施加石灰，在翻耕休闲地时必须施加足够的厩肥、泥炭及其他肥料。保证广泛地采用有机肥料和矿质肥料对谷物进行早春追肥。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部和苏联建筑材料工业部，在一个月内拟出关于开采作为肥料用的泥炭及开采和磨碎作为中和酸性土壤用的石灰的计划的建议，大大扩大下列数种设备的生产并增加它们对于农业的供应：泥炭采掘机，装运厩肥、泥炭和石灰的器具，自动铲子，拖拉机牵引自动卸货车，施加厩肥、泥炭、矿质肥料和石灰的万能撒肥机，重型圆盘耙，挖掘机，铲土机，推土机，以及碾磨石灰的装置。
      （八）苏共中央全体会议认为，许多集体农庄和国营农场在收割时大量损失谷物的现象是不能容忍的。
    责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关纠正对收割时损失谷物漠不关心的态度。为此，在一九五四年要保证大大提高联合机收割谷物的效能，改善收割组织工作，保证联合机得到应有的技术照管，及时准备运输工具运走联合机收下的谷物，把打谷场的工作机械化。
      （九）责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、机器制造工业部在两个月期限内就下列项目拟定建议，呈交苏联部长会议：
    增加联合机的生产，要在一九五四—一九五六年内充分供应机器拖拉机站和国营农场以联合机，保证及时收割谷物；
    大量生产高效率的各种谷物清选机器——谷物自动装卸机、固定谷物干燥机和活动谷物干燥机以及活动大台秤、流动发电站；
    建筑生产场地、住宅、文化生活福利建筑物，供应在开垦大片生荒地和熟荒地的地区的机器拖拉机站和国营农场以必要的设备；
    在一九五四—一九五六年供应农业以足够的汽车、主要是带木板和金属车身的自卸卡车，使汽车成为运输联合机收下谷物的主要工具。
      （十）机器制造工业部及运输和重型机器制造工业部的最重要的任务是：保证根据机器拖拉机站和国营农场所确定的对部件的数量和种类的需求，充分供应农业以拖拉机备件和农业机器备件。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、机器制造工业部、运输和重型机器制造工业部，立即采取措施急剧增加备件的产量，办法是：更好地利用和扩大现有的生产能力，在现在尚未参加这种生产的工厂中组织备件的生产。
    （丙）关于谷物的征购和收购
      （一）苏共中央全体会议指出，党和政府征购粮食的政策所依据的原则是按每公顷耕地依率征购，事实证明，这个原则是完全正确的，它激发了集体农庄发展谷物的兴趣。不过在征购粮食的实际工作中，有时严重破坏了按每公顷耕地依率征购的原则，在计划义务交售和实物交付的粮食征购时犯了一些严重的错误。有个别的州、区和集体农庄把没有完成的粮食征购计划推在收成好的其他州、区和集体农庄的身上，这是不对的。因为这样，按公顷依率征购的标准实际上就失去了意义。
    采购部、各加盟共和国部长会议、各边疆区执行委员会和各州执行委员会，在拟定和批准集体农庄向国家义务交售谷物和大米的按区计算的新标准时应注意：凡是生产谷物的条件大致差不多的各区，其义务交售标准相差不应太大，而一个行政区的范围内照例只能有一个义务交售标准。
      （二）鉴于西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索的集体农庄的新土地的耕作完全是由国家的机器进行的，特规定：这些区的新开垦地列为这样一种耕地，这种耕地从播种的第一年起即按规定义务向国家交售谷物，并按照为各该区的集体农庄所规定的固定的标准实行实物交付。
      （三）在收割期间，新成立的国营农场和在边远新开垦地区种植谷物的国营农场和集体农庄的谷物运输工作，照例由苏联采购运输处的汽车运输队和国营农场运输处的汽车运输队直接从联合机将谷物运往国家采购站，由国家采购站对谷物加以必要的精选、清选和干燥。（四）责成苏联国家计划委员会和采购部就下列一事向苏联部长会议提出建议：在苏联东部地区扩大建设自动化新仓库和粮食仓库，以充分容纳新开垦地区的集体农庄和国营农场交来的谷物。
    （五）为了增加国家粮食来源和提高集体农庄、集体农民对增产谷物的兴趣，必须尽量由国家根据收购价格收购集体农庄和集体农民的余粮。
    （六）责成采购部和全苏消费合作社中央联合会采取措施及时准备足够的商品，从而使集体农庄在按规定标准向国家交售和出售农产品后可以得到所需的商品。
  五、关于增产工业原料作物
      和发展果园业及葡萄种
        植业
    苏共中央全体会议指出，在战后的年代里，甜菜、棉花和含油作物的播种面积有相当的扩大，总收获量也增加了，这样就有可能增加棉织品、糖和植物油的生产。
    可是工业原料作物的现有生产水平仍然远远落后于国民经济增加了的需求，不能充分满足人民的需要。
    为了进一步增加工业原料作物产品的生产以保证消费量的必要提高，为了增加轻工业和食品工业的原料来源，苏共中央全体会议责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联食品工业部、州党委会、边疆区党委会、各加盟共和国党中央、各州执行委员会、边疆区执行委员会和各加盟共和国部长会议，保证在今后两三年内大大增加工业原料作物的单位面积产量和根据需要扩大这些作物的播种面积。
    在棉花作物方面。必须在今后几年内，在中亚细亚各共和国和南高加索的灌溉地区的集体农庄和国营农场，在哈萨克和在最适宜于种植这种作物的乌克兰共和国、俄罗斯联邦南部各区，在摩尔达维亚共和国，大大扩大棉花的播种面积，增加棉花的单位面积产量和总产量。保证将以前曾经耕作过但后来荒废的灌溉田地投入农业生产。
    批准乌兹别克党组织和苏维埃机关关于利用尚未使用的灌溉田地种植棉花的倡议。
    责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、中亚细亚、南高加索和南哈萨克斯坦州的植棉区的地方党组织和苏维埃机关，争取在一九五四—一九五八年在一切植棉集体农庄实行棉花苜蓿轮种制，严格监督集体农庄对水的利用，广泛采用更加完善的农作物灌溉法。在今后两三年内从根本上改善灌溉地区土壤改良的工作。进行必要的工作以整顿现有的沟渠和建筑新沟渠，今后不得使灌溉地盐硷化和荒废。
    责成苏联日用品工业部和各个管辖植棉区的共和国部长会议，采取措施以改进净棉工厂的物质技术基础和它们的征购网。
    在纤维用亚麻和大麻方面。苏共中央全体会议指出，纤维用亚麻和大麻的生产处于不可容忍的落后状态和荒废状态。在种植亚麻的各州、各共和国，大多数集体农庄的亚麻收成一直很低，征购亚麻产品计划不能完成，集体农庄自己不能保证得到足够的种籽。过去三年中，亚麻的播种面积缩减了百分之三十五。纤维用亚麻的总收获量不能保证工业对亚麻原料的需要。
    苏联农业部、党组织和苏维埃机关却容忍了这种状况，也不采取一些必要的措施来提高收获量、消除落后状态和进一步发展亚麻和大麻的生产。苏联日用品工业部没有采取一些必要的措施在生产中推行加工亚麻和大麻茎秆的工业方法。机器制造工业部在制造使亚麻业和大麻业的工作机械化的新机器方面表现得很缓慢。
    苏共中央全体会议责成苏联农业部、生产亚麻和大麻的各州的地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关，采取措施来大量扩大纤维用亚麻和大麻的播种面积，提高这两项作物的单位面积产量。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会和苏联农业部，在一个月内制订出关于提高亚麻生产和加强对增产亚麻和大麻的集体农庄和集体农民的物质鼓励的办法，呈交苏联部长会议。
    责成苏联日用品工业部保证建设足够的亚麻茎秆工业加工车间和亚麻脱粒车间。
    在甜菜方面，鉴于必须大量增加供应居民的食糖，今后两三年内应在最有利于种植甜菜的地区扩大甜菜的播种面积，至少要扩大三十万公顷，并应采取措施来大量提高甜菜的单位面积产量及其总产量。
    在含油作物方面。为了增加植物油的生产，必须在大力提高含油作物单位面积产量的同时，首先在伏尔加河流域、哈萨克、西伯利亚西部和乌拉尔地区把种植向日葵、油用亚麻和其他含油作物的播种面积增加五十万到六十万公顷。
    为了提高含油作物的单位面积产量，责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党组织和苏维埃机关在今后两三年内使各地含油作物的栽培工作全盘机械化。保证从一九五四年开始，改用正方穴播法种植向日葵。
    在发展果园业和葡萄种植业方面。我国要有丰富的食品，还必须大量增加水果、浆果和葡萄这一些有价值的食品的产量。
    但是许多集体农庄和国营农场的果园业和葡萄种植业处于无人管理的状态，成为农业中的落后部门。萨拉托夫州、奔萨州、古比雪夫州、高尔基州、图拉州和坦波夫州的集体农庄和国营农场的果园业经营得特别不好，这些地方的果园的面积比战前减少了。素来以种植果树闻名的地区，如库尔斯克州、奥勒尔州、别尔哥罗德州、利森州、克里米亚州、哈萨克共和国、乌兹别克共和国、塔吉克共和国、阿塞拜疆共和国、格鲁吉亚共和国、亚美尼亚共和国等地的果园业的工作，也做得不能令人满意。各大城市和工业中心附近的宜于种植果树的地区以及集体农民、工人和职员的宅旁园地的果木培植也不大发展。
    苏共中央全体会议认为目前果园业和葡萄种植业的经营情况是不能容忍的，因而提出一项最重要的任务：尽力提高果园和葡萄园的单位面积产量，扩大水果和硬壳果的种植面积，增加其总产量和商品产量，以便在最近几年中大量提高水果、浆果、葡萄的生产，以满足更大的需要。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联食品工业部和化学工业部，在一个月内就下列两项计划拟定措施和建议，并呈交苏联部长会议：
      （1）保证供给国营农场和集体农庄以足够的毒性化学药品和器材，以便消除果园和葡萄园中的病虫害；
      （2）使种植和照顾果树和葡萄树树苗的工作进一步机械化并和保证供应葡萄架。
    为了进一步发展茶叶、柑橘类、挥发性油料作物和其他作物的生产，党中央全体会议责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、苏联食品工业部、格鲁吉亚共和国、阿塞拜疆共和国、克拉斯诺达边疆区的地方党组织和苏维埃机关，采取一些补充办法来提高茶叶、柑橘类、挥发性油料作物的单位面积产量及其质量，并扩大这些作物的播种面积。在最近几年内要使采茶工作机械化。
    六、关于加强饲畜业的饲料
        基地
    （一）苏共中央全体会议指出，苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部，以及一些地方党组织和苏维埃机关，在建立饲畜业的饲料基地的实际工作中犯了重大的错误，这就是对饲料谷物和多汁饲料作物的生产重视得不够。结果集体农庄公有饲畜业对饲料谷物的需求只得到了微小的满足，而干草的产量还没有提高，虽然草的种植面积是增加了。而没有足够的饲料谷物和多汁饲料，要发展发达的公有饲畜业是不可想像的。
    多汁饲料的生产十分落后。青储饲料、块根饲料和瓜类饲料的单位面积产量很低，储存青储饲料的计划每年都不能完成。一种养分高的饲料——玉蜀黍的播种面积还不够大。有些区的集体农庄，不播种青储作物，而是从草地割草来作青储饲料的，这在经济上既不合算，而且又会导致不能完成饲料青储和干草征购的计划。
    粗饲料的产量和征购量也落后于饲畜业的需要，近几年来平均供给每头牲畜的粗饲料大大减少了。由于播种的草地和天然草场的收获量低，干草的产量很少。
    （二）建议苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关消除不够重视饲畜业的饲料谷物和多汁饲料作物生产的现象，保证扩大饲料谷物的播种面积并提高其单位面积产量，以便保证公有饲畜业获得足够的饲料谷物和其他精饲料。
    应采取措施来无条件地完成规定的储存多汁饲料的任务，办法是：根据各个地区的经济条件和自然条件扩大青储作物（特别是玉蜀黍）、块根饲料，饲料用甜菜和马铃薯、瓜类饲料的播种面积，并提高其单位面积产量。应组织改进草地和牧场的工作。
      （三）鉴于马铃薯是一种有很高价值的饲料，可以用来在短期内大量提高乳牛的产乳量和大规模地养肥猪和家禽，所以必须在非黑土地带，西伯利亚、中央黑土地带各州，以及乌克兰共和国的森林草原地带和低洼多林地区大量增加作饲料用的马铃薯的生产，以便使马铃薯成为这些地区集体农庄和国营农场中的重要饲料。
      （四）利用许多制糖厂、酒精制造厂、制酒厂和其他食品工业企业的有价值的废物来作养肥牲畜的饲料的工作，做得很不好，这是不对的。
    责成苏联食品工业部、苏联国营农场部和苏联农业部采取措施，建立牲畜饲养站以充分利用食品工业企业的废物，如：酒糟、糖糟、马铃薯残滓等。
      （五）为了增加质量高的青储饲料的征购量，责成苏联农业部、地方党组织和苏维埃机关大规模地建立青储塔和青储沟，改装不宜于收割谷物用的联合机供收割青储作物之用。
    （六）建议苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地质和矿藏保护部、建造部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议、哈萨克共和国部长会议、乌兹别克共和国部长会议、吉尔吉斯共和国部长会议、土库曼共和国部长会议和塔吉克共和国部长会议，在两个月内制订出开辟新的大片牧放牲畜用的季节性牧场的办法（凿井和建造饮水设备，建造畜舍，以及进行住宅建设和文化生活福利建设等），并呈交苏联部长会议。
      （七）应该指出，苏联国家计划委员会和苏联农业部在制订关于饲畜业的计划时，在确定增加牲畜头数和提高其产品生产率的计划任务方面采取了墨守成规的态度，没有充分利用可以发展饲畜业的自然条件和经济条件。
    责成苏联国家计划委员会、苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部纠正其在计划发展饲畜业个别部门时所发生的错误，而且必须根据全国各经济地区的特点来更正确地分配牲畜的头数，必须增加每一百公顷农业土地上的肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他牲畜产品。
  七、关于进一步发展国营农
      场和提高它们的赢利
    苏共中央全体会议认为，在执行党和政府所制定的关于迅速提高农业各部门和创造丰裕的农产品的任务中，国营农场起很大的作用。国营农场是大规模的国营的社会主义农场、配备有先进的农业机器，因此完全有可能在最短期间内大大地提高生产，以更多的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他农业产品上交给国家，并成为模范的赢利高的农场。
    可是现在国营农场的工作存在着很大的缺点。国营农场有大片土地没有被很好地用来发展农业和饲畜业，农作物的单位面积产量很低。许多国营农场年年不能完成国家发展农业的计划，生产的产品成本很高，而且还有大量的亏损。直到现在为止，国家自国营农场取得的谷物、肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他牲畜产品还很少。
    苏共中央全体会议指出，许多国营农场的落后现象和国营农场的生产、特别是谷物生产无人照管的现象，是苏联国营农场部领导不力的结果，是该部对推行先进经验这项工作采取漠不关心态度的结果。苏联国营农场部在国营农场土地的使用上有浪费的现象。该部在计划发展国营农场生产时，没有规定利用大片国营农场的田地来增产谷物、工业原料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜，没有规定较迅速地来发展饲畜业。特别不能容忍的是，苏联国营农场部对利用种马场附近的土地的浪费态度，这一类土地有五百四十万公顷，而用来种谷物的只有二十七万五千公顷。苏联国营农场部最严重的错误是，听任国营农场中的谷物播种面积的比重大量降低，这是和国家的利益非常矛盾的。
    苏联国营农场部不采取一些办法以熟练的领导干部和农业专家来加强国营农场，这就是国营农场生产严重落后的基本原因之一。
    有许多国营农场不遵守农艺师的要求而使耕地处于荒芜的状态，听任完成工作质量不高的现象存在，听任播种、翻耕休闲地和秋耕地的工作不按期进行，有相当大一部分田地用普通种籽播种。国营农场很少采用有机肥料和矿质肥料，使用石灰中和酸性土壤的工作的规模也不够大。由于不能及时进行收割工作或收割工作做得不好，收成遭到很大的损失。在国营农场中，先进的农作物栽培法，如种植马铃薯、蔬菜和其他中耕作物的正方穴播法或方形播种法，谷物的窄行播种法和交叉播种法以及其他一些能提高单位面积产量的先进的农业技术方法，推广得很缓慢。
    在发展饲畜业方面存在着许多很大的缺点。有许多国营农场不能完成国家规定的发展饲畜业和提高牲畜产品生产率的任务。有相当大一部分国营农场听任牲畜死亡和母畜不生育的现象存在，而使饲畜业受到很大损失。牲畜产品的生产率还是很低，特别是羊毛产量很少，猪和牛由于饲养得不好，体重很轻。有些国营农场乳牛的产乳量很低。
    国营农场中的饲畜业不能令人满意的主要原因之一，就是饲料生产和饲料征购工作有着严重落后的现象。国营农场中饲料作物的单位面积产量非常低。用作牲畜饲料的马铃薯和玉蜀黍的种植规模还不够大。
    国营农场中对拖拉机和农业机器的使用还不能令人满意，拖拉机和联合机的一般生产额还很低，机器停歇率很高，这就使主要的农业操作不能按期完成，降低了单位面积产量。许多国营农场没有各种机器的修理场，没有停放拖拉机和农业机器的机库和敞棚。
    在组织和进行国营农场的建设方面也有严重的缺点；拨给国营农场的建设经费，每年都有大笔没有动用。在国营农场中没有安插固定的建筑工人，建筑工程都是季节性的，而几乎没有实行建筑工程的机械化。这就必然使生产、居住、文化和生活福利用的房屋的建筑计划不能完成，而国营农场则极端缺乏这些房屋。国营农场中饲畜场和牧场的供水工作情况也很不好。
    苏联食品工业部所辖国营农场以及其他一些部和主管机关所辖的国营农场的工作中也存在着很大的缺点。
    （一）苏共中央全体会议认为：苏联国营农场部和各加盟共和国的国营农场部、某些有国营农场的部和主管机关、各州、边疆区和共和国的党组织和苏维埃机关的最主要的任务，就是从根本上改进国营农场的工作，提高农作物的单位面积产量和牲畜的产品生产率，并在这一基础上于最近两三年内使上交给国家的谷物最少要达到五亿普特，并要大量增加上交给国家的肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他农产品。必须大量降低产品成本，必须保证每一国营农场赢利并成为模范的、商品丰富的农场。
      （二）国营农场应该在增加谷物生产方面起重大的作用，增产办法有：开垦我国东部和东南部地区的熟荒地和生荒地，开垦一切现有国营农场中尚未被利用的土地，大力提高谷物的单位面积产量。国营农场由于是一种大规模的、有高度机械化水平的农场，完全有可能以最少的劳动力来生产谷物，并供给国家以最便宜的粮食。
    责成苏联国营农场部、俄罗斯联邦部长会议、哈萨克共和国部长会议、吉尔吉斯共和国部长会议、各边疆区执行委员会和各州执行委员会、哈萨克共产党中央委员会、吉尔吉斯共产党中央委员会、这些共和国的区党委会和州党委会以及国营农场场长，增加国营农场小麦和黍的播种面积：一九五四—一九五五年要增加四百三十万公顷，其中有二百三十万公顷是开垦现有国营农场中的生荒地、熟荒地和其他土地，有二百万公顷是开垦国家土地。
    必须在一九五四—一九五五年组织新的大规模的谷物国营农场，专门生产小麦、黍、燕麦、玉蜀黍和其他谷物，以及生产一部分向日葵和油用亚麻，农场的全部工作都完全机械化。规定新成立的国营农场的基本生产单位，应该是拖拉机田间工作队，这种工作队配有拖拉机、联合机、各种农业机器、活动房屋、帐幕、流动修理车、流动厨房和为拖拉机供应燃料和水的槽车。
    （三）建议苏联国营农场部、地方党组织和苏维埃机关保证从现有的国营农场中挑选熟练的、最有经验的国营农场场长、工程技术人员、农艺师、会计员、拖拉机工作队队长、拖拉机手、联合机手，派他们到新成立的谷物国营农场去工作。
    （四）苏联国营农场部、党组织和苏维埃机关应立即采取措施，以熟练的领导工作人员和专家来加强国营农场，通常应委派受过高等农业教育的专家来担任国营农场场长的职务，委派受过高等或中等农业教育的人担任各部或饲养场主任的职务，委派受过高等专科教育的人担任国营农场一等专家的职务。
    各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边疆区党委会和州党委会应从工业或国民经济其他各部门中挑选一些工程师和技术人员，派往国营农场工作，担任总工程师、修配场主任和各部或饲养场的机械师。
    （五）建议苏联国营农场部消除计划国营农场生产时所犯的错误，根据每一自然经济区域的国营农场的情况，制订出最合理地利用土地的措施，决定各部门的正确配合。
    每月审查并批准种马场扩大谷物的播种面积和发展生产畜产品的饲畜业的任务，以便更充分地利用种马场附近的全部土地。
    （六）建议苏联国营农场部和各加盟共和国国营农场部，保证国营农场各生产部门进一步机械化，从根本上改进机器的使用，广泛地建筑修配场、停放机器的机库、敞棚和畜舍。还应展开住宅、文化生活福利建筑物的建设。
    规定每一国营农场和种马场通常应有一个合格的修配场，足够数量的停放拖拉机、联合机和各种农业机器的机库、敞棚和柏油场地、一个加油站、一个汽车房和一个储藏备件和器材的仓库。
    （七）责成苏联国营农场部和各加盟共和国国营农场部采取一些补充措施，来胜利实现苏共中央九月全体会议所规定的关于发展国营农场饲畜业的任务。
    为此必须：
    （1）保证提高牲畜的繁殖率和保护长大了的牲畜和幼畜，使乳牛的头数迅速增加并提高其产乳量；
    （2）大大地扩大养猪业，在一九五六年上交给国家的猪肉应达四十五万吨，养猪时应广泛地利用青储马铃薯和玉蜀黍以及食品工业的废物；
      （3）随着绵羊只数的增加，应采取一些措施提高绵羊的羊毛生产率，并在最近两三年内增加细毛绵羊和半细毛绵羊的只数；
    （4）保证每一个国营农场建立饲畜业的固定饲料基地，其办法首先是：根据各地区的自然条件大量扩大作脱粒用和青储用的玉蜀黍的播种面积、作饲料用的马铃薯的播种面积、甜菜、苏丹草和其他最有价值的和收获量高的饲料作物的播种面积，并广泛地进行改进天然草场和牧场的工作。
    （八）苏共中央全体会议非常重视根本改善国营农场的工作和急速提高国营农场生产的工作，因此特责成各加盟共和国党中央、边疆区党委会、州党委会和区党委会更加注意对国营农场的领导，加强对国营农场工作的监督，并采取措施以熟练干部来加强国营农场。党组织有责任经常进行工作来加强国营农场的党组织，使它们在争取国营农场的生产的进一步高涨中发挥更大的作用和担负更大的责任，加强党的政治工作，改善国营农场工作人员的文化设备。
  八、关于在组织上和经济上
    加强集体农庄和乡村中的
    政治工作
    （一）党和政府对农业提出的复杂而极其重要的任务，要求党组织和苏维埃机关对农业生产的一切部门进行更加十分熟练而深入的领导，并要求它们善于组织群众解决农业高涨的根本问题。
    苏共中央全体会议指出，苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、党组织和苏维埃机关对苏共中央九月全体会议揭露出来的农业领导方面的缺点，克服得极其缓慢。
    在领导农业方面有一种有害的、官僚主义的工作方法，这就是机关领导工作人员和专家没有把主要力量用来进行具体生动的工作——组织集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员执行党和政府关于进一步发展农业的决议，而是埋头于草拟无数指令、决议、文件、信件、报告和其他常常是对谁都没有用处的文件，因而使得党和苏维埃的工作人员和专家没有能够直接在机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场中进行组织工作。
    苏联农业部和苏联国营农场部这种错误的、高高在上的官僚主义的领导方法，感染给地方农业机关和机器拖拉机站，它们也使集体农庄和国营农场充斥着多余的表报和各式各样不需要的文件。
    苏共中央全体会议要求苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、州党委会、边疆区党委会和各加盟共和国党中央消除农业机关工作中的严重缺点，根绝对农业的有害的文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，减少表报和公文的往来，同集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场建立有机的联系，提高工作人员的工作责任心，使他们集中力量去实际地帮助集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场掌握先进生产经验并顺利解决它们所担负的任务。
    （二）一些州对于苏共中央九月全体会议决议关于改组区党委会和区执行委员会工作的指示，执行得很缓慢而且往往流于形式。在许多地方，以区党委书记为领导的区党委会机器拖拉机站工作组实际上还没有着手工作。在许多州和共和国里，在编工作组时，没有注意将那些受过优良训练的、了解自己的任务的、通晓集体农庄生产的、热爱党的工作的人编在里面。
    许多区党委会仍然是以老一套的工作方法进行工作，负责机器拖拉机站的区党委书记和指导员仍然住在区的中心，把大部分时间花在区的中心，很少到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去，不去深入它们的生活，没有给予它们必要的帮助。
    在一些州、边疆区和共和国内，以有经验的、熟悉农业的、能够正确而干练地领导集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的干部来加强乡村区党委会和区执行委员会的工作，做得很差。
    责成州党委会、边疆区党委会和各加盟共和国党中央在最短期内完成改组农业区党委会的工作，组织区党委会在机器拖拉机站地区工作的书记和其他工作人员的工作，以便不是在形式上，而是在实际上消除对机器拖拉机站和集体农庄的领导无人负责和不负责任的现象，根绝文牍主义的工作方法和忙于空洞会议的作风，以便使这些工作组在集体农庄和机器拖拉机站中进行经常的政治、组织和文化教育工作，去接触每一个集体农民和机器拖拉机站的每一个工作人员。
    采取以熟练的领导干部来加强区一级党组织和苏维埃机关的措施，办法是：从州、边疆区和共和国的党组织和苏维埃机关中抽出优秀的工作人员，从城市和工业中心抽出党和苏维埃的工作人员，调到农业区党委会和区执行委员会做固定工作。
    （三）苏共中央全体会议认为：完成在农业方面所提出的任务的最重要条件之一是：进一步从组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄。
    集体农庄制度是先进的社会制度。集体农庄有着无限的提高农业生产的潜能。但是要充分发挥这种潜能，必须大大改进对集体农庄的领导，把所有的集体农庄一无例外地提高到先进农庄的水平。
    我们还有不少的落后集体农庄没有应有的劳动纪律，劳动组织得不好，劳动生产率很低，没有以主人翁的态度使用土地，结果这些农庄生产的农产品很少。
    责成各加盟共和国党中央，边疆区党委会、州党委会和区党委会，各加盟共和国部长会议，边疆区执行委员会、州执行委员会和区执行委员会，苏联农业部及其地方机关，有系统地、深入地在组织上和经济上加强集体农庄。必须采取措施，大力加强集体农庄的劳动纪律，改善劳动组织，坚决推行农业工作中先进的生产定额，以不断提高集体农庄的劳动生产率，合理地使用集体农庄土地，以便从每一公顷农业土地上获得更多的农产品。
    只有在这一基础上才能有步骤地提高农业总产量，提高商品农产品的产量，增加集体农庄公有财富，逐年增进集体农民的物质福利。
    党组织、苏维埃机关和农业机关应当特别关心在所有的集体农庄中推广先进集体农庄和农业生产革新者的经验。
    （四）许多地方党组织和苏维埃机关没有采取必要的措施来加强集体农庄主席阵容。有一部分集体农庄需要加强领导。在目前的条件下，集体农庄主席的作用不可估量地提高了，而且能否胜利地完成党交给集体农庄的任务，首先要依靠集体农庄主席。
    责成区党委会、州党委会、边疆区党委会、各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会，保证领导每个集体农庄的都是善于经营大规模集体农庄的熟练而有经验的领导人。
    为了提高地方党组织对正确选拔、分配和培养集体农庄领导干部的责任，集体农庄主席的任免必须在州党委会、边疆区党委会和各加盟共和国党中央备案，而集体农庄副主席、生产工作队队长、饲畜场主任的任免应在区党委会备案。
      （五）应该指出，现行的培养集体农庄领导干部的制度——培养集体农庄主席的三年制农业学校不能胜任工作。这种学校招生的主要对象是一些在不完全中等学校毕业而没有领导农业经验的青年，至于有丰富的实际经验但没有受过必需的普通教育的人，则大多进不了这种学校。
    责成苏联农业部和苏联文化部在一个月内，就如何从没有受过必要教育的实际工作者培养集体农庄主席，向苏联部长会议提出建议。
      （六）党中央委员会全体会议指出，个别的党和苏维埃的领导工作人员，其中包括党州委会书记和一些州苏维埃执行委员会主席，不大懂得农业，也不研究农业生产的基本知识。这就严重地影响到集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的领导工作的水平。现在向和农业生产有关的党和苏维埃干部提出一项任务：掌握经营农业的基本知识，熟习农业先进工作者所采用的方法。
    （七）苏共中央全体会议认为开垦生荒地和熟荒地对大量增加谷物生产具有重大的国家意义，特责成党、工会、青年团组织在农村机械操使者、专家和农业领导干部中间展开宣传工作，以便吸收志愿去做固定的垦荒工作的人。在宣传工作中必须利用报纸、无线电、电影和其他宣传鼓动工具。苏共中央全体会议号召集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工作人员积极参加垦荒工作。
    （八）要完成苏共中央九月全体会议和这次全体会议提出的进一步发展农业的任务，就要求坚决地加强农村中的政治工作。党组织应努力使全体农村劳动者，集体农庄男女庄员、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作人员、农业专家，都能深刻地了解进
  一步提高农业的任务，并各自在自己的岗位上为完成这一任务而忘我地劳动。必须更广泛地吸收我们农村中的知识分子，教师、医生、农艺师、饲畜师、工程师，从事政治工作和群众文化工作。这是
  一支巨大的力量，它能够而且应该成为党组织的支柱。
    苏共中央全体会议号召农村中的全体共产党员和青年团员、全体集体农民和机器拖拉机站及国营农场的工作人员，广泛地展开社会主义竞赛，争取大力提高谷物生产，争取全部农作物丰收，争取进
  一步增加牲畜头数和提高牲畜产品的生产率。
