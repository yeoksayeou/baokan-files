	The Pentagon's Troubles
	Lisifu
	On January 5th, Hanson Baldwin, the military commentator for "The New York Times," commented sadly on the low morale of the U.S. military, saying that U.S. soldiers "cannot take pride in their uniforms and their army." Such arguments from Baldwin are becoming more and more common in American newspapers and magazines. Not only that, but even senior officials at the Pentagon are deeply troubled and anxiously uneasy about this unfortunate decline in morale.

	Last autumn, "The New York Times" published an article discussing the low morale of the U.S. military, which also quoted the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Radford, as saying: "The morale of the U.S. military has declined to a terrible level." After this article was published, it immediately aroused fierce criticism from the American military authorities, who feared that their dirty linen was being aired in public. As a result, the editors of "The New York Times" had no choice but to admit their mistake. Not long after, in order to atone for its offense to the military authorities, the newspaper published a clearly fabricated "letter to the editor," spreading an optimistic atmosphere and attempting to convince the American people that the morale of the U.S. military was not low.

	However, this "optimistic" argument was quickly refuted by the facts. Young, a special assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Army, openly announced that the Pentagon was uneasy due to the increasing number of soldier desertions; and the U.S. Department of the Army also announced stricter regulations on the punishment of deserters, increasing the rewards for arresting them.

	Because of the low morale of the U.S. military, the heads of the Pentagon and American "psychologists" have expressed dissatisfaction with this sentiment among American youth. Not long ago, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson said at a press conference: "We cannot find the number of young people we would like to volunteer as pilots in universities." Baldwin added at the meeting: "Most American young people avoid serving in the army as if they were avoiding a contagious disease." At the annual meeting of the "American Psychological Association," a speaker also pointed out: "American young people see joining the army as signing a contract of indentured servitude."

	This is the problem that the Pentagon and the likes of Baldwin are troubled by. But they have not thought about finding answers to these problems.

	But the answer to the problem is very simple: it is now very difficult for the American reactionaries to deceive American young people into joining an army that is openly preparing for a war of aggression. As Assistant Secretary of Defense Hannah lamented: In America, "the military is becoming less and less attractive as a profession."

    五角大楼的苦恼
    里斯
    一月五日，“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍尔温在评论美军士气低落一事时悲哀地说：美军士兵“没有能以自己的军服和自己的军队引以自豪”。鲍尔温的这种论调，目前在美国的报纸刊物中，是越来越多了。不仅这样，就是五角大楼的高级官员们也苦恼之至，为这种倒霉的士气低落而焦急不安。
    去年秋天，“纽约时报”曾刊登过一篇谈美军士气低落的文章，其中并引用美国参谋长联席会议主席、海军上将雷德福的话说：“美国军队的士气低落到了可怕的地步。”这篇文章发表后，马上引起了害怕家丑外扬的美国军事当局的猛烈抨击。结果，“纽约时报”的编者只好承认自己倒霉。过了不久，为了向军事当局赔罪，该报又发表了一篇显然是捏造的“读者来信”，散布一种乐观空气，企图使美国人民相信，美国军队的士气并不低落。
    然而，这种“乐观”的论调，很快地就被事实否定了。美国陆军部特别助理杨格公开宣布，五角大楼由于士兵逃亡越来越多而感到不安；而美国陆军部也公布了加重对逃兵的惩罚条例，提高逮捕逃兵的奖金。
    因为美军士气低落，五角大楼的首脑们和美国的“心理学家”们，都对美国青年的这种情绪表示不满。不久前，美国国防部部长威尔逊在一次记者招待会上说：“在大学里找不到我们所希望的数目的志愿作飞行员的青年人。”鲍尔温在会上也补充说：“美国大多数青年像躲避传染病一样地避免到军队中去服役。”在“美国心理学家协会”年会上，一位发言人也指出：“美国青年人把加入军队看成是签卖身契约。”
    这就是五角大楼和鲍尔温之流所苦恼的问题。可是他们并没想对这些问题找出答案。
    但是问题的答案却非常简单，那就是美国反动集团已经很难欺骗美国青年人去参加明目张胆地准备侵略战争的军队了。正如美国助理国防部长汉纳所悲叹的：在美国，“军界作为一个职业而论正日渐不能吸引人了。”
