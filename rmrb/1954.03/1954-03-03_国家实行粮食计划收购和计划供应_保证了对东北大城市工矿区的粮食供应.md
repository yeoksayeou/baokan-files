The state implements planned grain purchase and supply, guaranteeing grain supply to large cities and industrial and mining areas in Northeast China.

The Northeast is currently a region in China with a relatively high concentration of industry. With the development of industrial construction and the continuous increase of the industrial zone population, the amount of grain supplied by the state is also constantly increasing. The percentage increase in grain supply in several major industrial areas in the Northeast in 1953 compared to 1952 was: Anshan 53, Shenyang 43, Benxi 42, Fushun 37, and Harbin 23. Moreover, the grain supply, like the growth of industrial production in these areas, will continue to increase. Under the slogan of supporting industrial construction, farmers in the Northeast sold large quantities of surplus grain to the state. According to statistics as of February 14, the region's grain purchase plan has been completed by 97.5 percent. During this period, the state transported large quantities of grain to various industrial areas. By the end of January, the state's grain reserves in Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, Fushun, Benxi, and other places had increased by an average of about 25 percent compared to the same period last year. These grain reserves can supply the area until the new grain is on the market at the end of November this year. In order to better store the grain reserves, the state-owned grain department in Harbin City built two new warehouses with more than 135,000 square meters, and the number of warehouse staff also increased from 335 to 490. After the implementation of planned grain supply in major industrial and mining areas, a supply network consisting of state-owned grain companies, retail stores, and cooperatives was formed, making it extremely convenient for residents to purchase grain. Since the implementation of planned purchase and supply, grain prices in the Northeast have remained stable, as they have in the past.
  
The Northeast is China's main producing area for miscellaneous grains. In order to supply the industrial areas of the Northeast with the necessary refined grains, the state has carried out grain seed adjustment work. For several months, sorghum and soybeans from the Northeast have been continuously transported to all parts of the country, and large quantities of rice and flour from Central South, Southwest, and East China have been transported to the Northeast. The people's governments at all levels in the Northeast, with reference to past supply levels, have planned to supply residents with coarse grains and refined grains in proportion. The grain sales stations in Harbin City have a complete range of grain varieties, and people can buy various types of grain at the grain sales stations. (Xinhua News Agency)

    国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应
    保证了对东北大城市工矿区的粮食供应
    国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应，保证了对东北区大城市工矿区的粮食供应。
    东北目前是我国工业比较集中的地区，随着工业建设的发展和工业区人口的不断增加，国家供应粮食的数量也在不断增多。东北几个主要工业区一九五三年比一九五二年粮食供应量增加的百分数为：鞍山五十三，沈阳四十三，本溪四十二，抚顺三十七，哈尔滨二十三。而且，粮食供应量像这些地区工业生产的增长一样，还要不断增加。东北农民在支援工业建设的口号下把大批余粮卖给了国家。据截至二月十四日的统计，全区粮食收购计划已完成百分之九十七点五。国家在这个时期把大批粮食运到了各工业区。到一月底止，沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨、抚顺、本溪等地国家粮食的库存量比去年同期平均约增加了百分之二十五。这些存粮可以供应到今年新粮上市后的十一月底。哈尔滨市国营粮食部门为了更好地保管库存粮，新建了两个拥有十三万五千多平方公尺的仓库，仓库工作人员也由三百三十五名增加到四百九十名。各主要工矿区在粮食计划供应后，由国营粮食公司、零售商店、合作社组成了供应网，居民购粮极为方便。实行计划收购和计划供应以来，东北粮价像以往一样，一直保持着稳定局面。
  东北是我国杂粮的主要产区。国家为了供应东北工业区以必需的细粮，进行了粮种的调剂工作。数月来，东北的高粱、大豆源源运到全国各地，中南、西南、华东地区有大批大米和面粉运到东北。东北各地人民政府参照过去的供应水平，有计划地按比例供应居民以粗粮和细粮。哈尔滨市各粮食销售站里粮种都很齐全，人民可以在售粮站买到各种品种的粮食。（新华社）
