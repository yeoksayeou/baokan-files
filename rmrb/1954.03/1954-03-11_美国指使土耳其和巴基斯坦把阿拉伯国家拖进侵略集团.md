Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: After instigating Turkey and Pakistan to conclude the Turkey-Pakistan Agreement and announcing military "aid" to Pakistan, the United States is attempting to pull some Arab countries into a Middle East aggressive bloc.

According to a United Press International dispatch from New York: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs Byroade stated on the 5th that "there is a need for an effective regional security agreement" in the Middle East. He said that the actions of Turkey and Pakistan, which have announced their intention to conclude a military treaty, "provide a real impetus" for the establishment of a Middle East aggressive bloc. Moreover, Turkey and Pakistan are now carrying out an arrangement according to the U.S. plan in order to pull some other countries in the Near and Middle East into this bloc. Byroade said: "We hope that other countries will be interested in this action initiated by these two countries on either side of the Middle East." In reporting Byroade's remarks, United Press International revealed the targets the U.S. government intends to win over first and their purpose in piecing together the Middle East bloc. United Press International said: "The United States hopes to see Iraq, possibly Iran, and Saudi Arabia join a Middle East defense treaty that would encircle Russia's southwest."

Turkey is actively engaged in activities for the U.S. conspiracy plan. Turkish Foreign Minister Köprülü told the National Assembly on February 24 that Turkey wants to establish a "foolproof" "collective security system." He expressed his intention to invite other countries to join this organization. Pakistani Prime Minister Ali has also repeatedly expressed his willingness to work towards piecing together the Middle East bloc. When requesting military "aid" from the United States, Ali said that Pakistan would "make an important contribution" to the "strength" of this region. According to a Reuters dispatch from Dacca on the 6th, Ali is now separately inviting the Kings of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Transjordan to visit Karachi in order to discuss the issue of pulling these countries into the Middle East bloc.

    美国指使土耳其和巴基斯坦把阿拉伯国家拖进侵略集团
    【新华社十日讯】美国在策动土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结土巴协定并宣布给予巴基斯坦以军事“援助”之后，正企图把一些阿拉伯国家拉进中东侵略集团。
    据合众社纽约消息：美国负责近东、南亚及非洲事务的助理国务卿拜娄德在五日表示：在中东“有订立有效的区域安全协定的必要”。他说：土耳其和巴基斯坦已宣布打算缔结军事条约的行动，对于建立中东侵略集团，“给予了真实的动力”。而且，土耳其和巴基斯坦现在正在按照美国的计划进行着一种安排，以便把中近东的其他一些国家拉进这个集团。拜娄德说：“我们希望其他国家能对这两个在中东两侧的国家所发起的这种行动感到兴趣。”合众社在报道拜娄德的谈话时透露了美国政府为拼凑中东集团所要首先拉拢的对象及其目的，合众社说：“美国希望看到伊拉克、可能还有伊朗和沙特阿拉伯参加一个中东防御条约，这个条约将包围俄国的西南部。”
    土耳其正在为美国的阴谋计划进行积极的活动。土耳其政府外交部长柯普路鲁二月二十四日向国民议会说，土耳其要建立一种“毫无漏洞”的“集体安全制度”。他表示要邀请其他国家加入这种组织。巴基斯坦总理阿里也一再表示愿意为拼凑中东集团奔走。在向美国要求军事“援助”时，阿里曾说，巴基斯坦将对这个地区的“实力”“作出重要的贡献”。据路透社达卡六日消息，阿里现在正分别邀请伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯以及外约旦等国国王访问喀喇蚩，以便商讨把这些国家拉进中东集团的问题。
