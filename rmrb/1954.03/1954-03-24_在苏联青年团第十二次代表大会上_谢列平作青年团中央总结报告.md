Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: At the 12th National Congress of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union, the Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, A. Xie Yuli, made a summary report of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on the 19th.

Xie Yuli said that the 12th National Congress of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union was convened under a strong political and labor upsurge, and in the context of the national struggle for the further prosperity of our motherland.

Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people are confidently advancing along the road of communism. The Leninist Young Communist League, established and nurtured by the Communist Party, is the Party's loyal assistant and combat reserve. Xie Yuli said that the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Youth League Congress once again clearly demonstrated the Party's special concern for the Youth League and the Soviet youth. On behalf of all the delegates present, he assured the Party Central Committee that the Youth League would gloriously fulfill its sacred responsibility to the Soviet people and the beloved socialist motherland.

Xie Yuli spoke about the participation of Youth League members and youth in communist construction. Youth League members and youth have set an example of selfless labor in both industry and agriculture. Outstanding industrial innovators and advanced agricultural workers—Wa. Kucher, Ye. Starotubtsev, An. Supotin, Fu. Zakharov, Ni. Chkilev, Hero of Socialist Labor Wa. Yeliseyev, Li. Kolabelnikova, An. Zhandarova, Ao. Agafonova, Ma. Levchenko, Ge. Mukhanov, Heroes of Socialist Labor Wa. Volchishin and Na. Leva, Twice Hero of Socialist Labor Ni. Smirnova, and many others, are well-known throughout the country. Youth League members and all Soviet youth actively participate in implementing the measures of the Party and the government to rapidly increase agricultural and consumer goods production. However, it would be wrong to ignore that the work level of many Youth League organizations lags behind the requirements of life and the tasks put forward by the Party. One of the main shortcomings is that in recent years, Youth League organizations have not participated sufficiently in national and economic construction. Many Youth League organizations have been self-enclosed in Youth League internal affairs, divorced from production and life, and divorced from the struggle to complete the production plans of enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, and have not shown the due initiative and combat effectiveness. The lack of basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production among Youth League staff seriously hinders the progress of work. It is unimaginable to guide the work of the Youth League organizations specifically and correctly, and lead them to participate in economic activities, if there is a lack of basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production.

Comrade Malenkov said in his speech at the voters' meeting in the Leningrad constituency of Moscow: "Our urgent task is to truly make the concern for vigorously increasing labor productivity the center of all practical leadership work for the further development of the national economy. We must launch a truly broad national movement to strive for a significant increase in labor productivity, and to raise the labor productivity of every industrial enterprise, every construction site, every transportation department, every collective farm, state farm, and machine tractor station—that is, every front of our great socialist construction—to a high level."

Our task is to warmly respond to this call and launch a socialist competition for a new upsurge in labor productivity with a fighting spirit. Youth League organizations should actively overcome the shortcomings in labor organization, fight against unproductive stoppages, strive for the balanced work of various enterprises, and help the Party organizations more vigorously to realize the comprehensive mechanization of production, promote new technologies, improve technological processes, and promote advanced labor organization methods. Youth League organizations should strive to ensure that all young workers in industry, transportation, and construction sites actively participate in socialist competition, resolutely fight for streamlining and saving, for discovering and fully utilizing production potential, and for producing high-quality products.

Xie Yuli continued, the Soviet youth enthusiastically welcomed the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, which put forward a most urgent national task: to rapidly improve the entire agricultural sector in the next two to three years on the basis of a vigorous upsurge in socialist industry. The Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Party emphasized that in this work, the further development of grain production, which is the foundation of the entire agricultural production, is of particularly great significance. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the initiative of the Youth League to mobilize 100,000 machine operators from Youth League members and youth to voluntarily reclaim virgin and fallow land. 60,000 Youth League members have already gone to the reclamation areas, and a total of 400,000 young people have applied to participate in the reclamation work. This is a testament to the high patriotism of our glorious Soviet youth. Youth League organizations are launching socialist competitions and promoting advanced labor production methods, as well as the latest achievements in agricultural science and practice. Since the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, about 200,000 Youth League members have gone to livestock breeding to engage in fixed work. About 10,000 young agricultural experts and more than 16,000 young machine operators have returned to the countryside.

In order to ensure that young people participate more actively in the implementation of the tasks put forward by the Party and the government in agriculture, it is necessary to lead the rural Youth League organizations more skillfully and deeply. Xie Yuli said that Youth League organizations should strive to widely promote advanced agricultural technology methods, adopt and master grain crop rotation systems as soon as possible, improve the quality of field work, shorten the period of field work, pay attention to improving seed breeding work, comply with various quotas for sowing, greatly increase the accumulation and application of local fertilizers, and improve the application of mineral fertilizers. Youth League organizations should always care about the feeding and management of all livestock, especially young livestock, and strive to improve the productivity of livestock products. We must pay more attention to the base of livestock feed, strive to expand the planting area of forage grains and increase their yield per unit area, and unconditionally complete the task of storing succulent feed by increasing the amount of silage, especially corn, and increasing its yield per unit area.

Machine tractor stations are a decisive force in the development of agriculture and the most important base for the state to lead collective farms. Youth League organizations in machine tractor stations have participated in production work more actively than in the past. The connection and cooperation between the Youth League organizations of machine tractor stations and the collective farms they serve are increasing day by day. However, although the majority of the two million machine tractor station workers are young people, many Youth League leading bodies, especially the Youth League state committees of Kaluga, Tula, Orel, Tambov, Molotov, and Minsk states, are rarely concerned about the work of the Youth League organizations of machine tractor stations. Youth League organizations should improve their work among young machine operators, and strive to ensure that every young machine operator completes his daily work quota well and guarantees a bumper harvest on the land they cultivate. It is necessary to care for young machine operators to be proficient in advanced methods of cultivating crops and to constantly study new technologies.

The All-Union Conference of Machine Tractor Station Staff convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in the Kremlin in January this year called on all machine operators to launch a socialist competition and strive for a further upsurge in agriculture. Xie Yuli said that our task is to attract all young machine operators to participate in this competition. The competition of Youth League member-youth tractor work teams should become an indispensable part of this competition.

The recent Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU exposed the major shortcomings in the work of state farms and pointed out the way to rapidly increase the production of state farms. In most state farms, there are numerous Youth League organizations. Youth League leading bodies must correct their indifferent attitude towards the work of Youth League organizations in state farms, should enhance their role in the work of state farms and their responsibility for the situation in the farms, and mobilize all Youth League members and youth to strive to greatly reduce product costs, strive to ensure that the work of every state farm is profitable, and assist Party organizations in turning state farms into model farms that can produce a lot of marketable grain.

Now, more urgently than ever before, all Youth League staff are required to master agricultural production knowledge and be familiar with the work of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. It is necessary to make all Youth League staff, without exception, earnestly study the basic knowledge and advanced experience of agricultural science and resolutely ensure that this knowledge and experience can be promoted in agricultural production.

A large part of the report talked about the issue of national education and the work of Youth League organizations in schools. Thanks to the constant care of the Party and the government, the number of secondary schools, technical schools, and universities in our country is increasing year by year, and the number of textbooks published and school equipment is also constantly increasing. There are now more than 57 million students in the Soviet Union, 8 million more than in 1940. There are more than 3 million students in higher and secondary specialized schools. No capitalist country has or can have such a large-scale national education. The ruling class of capitalist countries hopes that the working masses will be ignorant. The United States is a clear example, where there are more than 10 million illiterates.

The Youth League and Soviet schools jointly undertake the noble and important task of educating and cultivating children. Xie Yuli pointed out that Youth League organizations are helping teachers to enable students to obtain extensive and solid knowledge. He then pointed out the serious shortcomings in this regard. Youth League organizations do not play a sufficient role in improving school teaching and education work. In many schools, there is still a phenomenon of overburdening Youth League members and Young Pioneers, and tedious meetings and conferences are often held, which waste a lot of time for students. Youth League and Young Pioneer organizations in schools cannot and should not repeat the work done by teachers. Students should be attracted to participate in experimental groups and technical groups, to prepare physical education teaching materials, to enrich the equipment of classrooms, to participate in laboratory work and the work of school-affiliated experimental areas, and to help carry out craft education. Competitions, evenings, sports meets, and trips should be organized regularly to help students broaden their horizons and master knowledge more deeply.

Youth League state committees, district committees, central committees of Youth Leagues of various federated republics, and Youth League organizations in schools, should improve the work of cultivating students, so that they have noble moral qualities such as loyalty and honesty, collectivism, comradely love, and friendship; prevent students from acquiring bad qualities and bad habits such as selfishness, laziness, and mischief; and correct students' improper behavior. More assistance should be given to schools to enable the younger generation to master the basic principles of communist morality well, and to be able to understand and apply them to life. To solve this task, not only must an atmosphere of intolerance to undisciplined phenomena be created in every school, every Youth League and Young Pioneer organization, but first of all, we should think of some methods that are beneficial to children and make them interested, and organize various games and entertainment for children and teenagers in schools, parks, gardens, amusement parks and residential courtyards on rest days. The Children's Palace, the Young Naturalist Station, the Young Technician Station, the Children's Railway, and sports schools should play a significant role in this regard.

Xie Yuli said that it is necessary to better educate students to love physical labor, teach them to apply the knowledge they have gained in schools to practice, and help students study the basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production.

It is necessary to improve the role of Youth League organizations among teachers in the work of teaching and cultivating students, pay more attention to the political and ideological education of young teachers, help them to smoothly master educational technology, and more actively attract them to participate in the work of Youth League and Young Pioneer organizations in schools.

The Leninist Young Pioneer organization occupies an important position in Soviet school life. Millions of Young Pioneers have shown excellent results in their studies. There are many such Young Pioneer detachments, whose members are constantly improving and who regularly carry out various educational activities. However, there are significant shortcomings in the work of Young Pioneer organizations. The work in many detachments is clichéd, the forms are monotonous, there are too many regulations, and there is too much organization. In many detachments, the independence of Young Pioneer organizations is violated. Adults take care of children's affairs on their behalf. Young Pioneers do not have the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities, creativity, and talents in practical work. Little has been done in cultivating Young Pioneers' ability to independently solve practical tasks within their capabilities. It is known that one of the tasks of Young Pioneer organizations is to assist schools in enabling students to master knowledge, but individual Youth League staff, Young Pioneer instructors, and teachers have not correctly implemented this requirement, and have even misinterpreted it.

It is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of Young Pioneer organizations in order to improve the work of each team and each detachment. All work should be carried out through the initiative and independence of the Young Pioneers, and should be carried out in a lively and interesting way.

Higher education has been widely developed in our country. In the past academic year alone, 500,000 experts graduated from universities and technical schools. Their learning level is also constantly improving. However, there are also serious shortcomings in the work of Youth League organizations in universities and secondary specialized schools. Some students do not study in depth, cannot complete their study assignments on time, often skip classes or do not do their homework. Youth League organizations do not educate students enough, cannot make them fully understand their responsibility to the country, and cannot make them fully prepared to complete any work that the motherland needs.

Xie Yuli emphasized the significance of Youth League organizations conducting ideological work among young people during the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism. The mission of the Youth League is to educate young men and women in the spirit of Soviet patriotism, the spirit of friendship among all ethnic groups, and the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and to make them unyielding fighters for the realization of the Communist Party's policies. Thanks to the enormous educational work carried out by the Party and the League, an outstanding generation of young communist builders has grown up. Millions of young people have dedicated their strength and knowledge to seek the prosperity of the motherland and strive for the happiness of the Soviet people. There are also serious shortcomings in ideological work. There are still dogmatic and passive learning attitudes in theoretical study. Young people often take things out of context and copy dogmas. We should enable young people not to memorize some formulas or quotations by rote, but to grasp the essence of the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The publicity work is not well combined with the tasks of communist construction, and is not well combined with the specific work of the states, border regions, republics, and enterprises, machine tractor stations, and collective farms.

Youth League organizations should unremittingly cultivate the noble moral qualities of Soviet people in young people, educate them to be responsible for their actions, have a sense of civic responsibility to the motherland, and educate Soviet youth to establish comradely relations with each other, be loyal to friends, and respect elders. We must ensure that the conduct of our young people and Youth League members is exemplary whether on the street, in the family, or in public places. We should make the noble and selfless qualities displayed by young men and women in their daily labor and life the property of all young people.

Political mobilization occupies an important position in the work of Youth League organizations in conducting communist education among young people. It is necessary to ensure that the most cultured Youth League members actively participate in mass mobilization work, select mobilizers, and carry out work in youth work teams, work shifts, dormitories, field camps, livestock farms, and state farm departments. The Youth League should adopt such methods of mobilization work among young people as youth mobilization teams, "mobile newspapers," "combat small newspapers," "express reports," etc.

Xie Yuli pointed out that newspapers, cultural and educational institutions, works of art, movies, sports activities, and sports play a great role in conducting communist education among young people. He pointed out that it is necessary to more widely and fully utilize all these methods. Youth League newspapers should reflect the various aspects of young people's lives in Youth League organizations, expose shortcomings, and mobilize young people to complete the tasks put forward by the Communist Party. We have many good newspapers and magazines that are widely welcomed by young people. However, there are also significant shortcomings in the work of youth newspapers and periodicals: the ideological and writing levels of the articles they publish are very low, and many remarks are superficial. Xie Yuli said that it is necessary to raise the work of youth newspapers and magazines to the level of Communist Party newspapers and periodicals, and youth newspapers and periodicals should well inspire Youth League members to participate in political and economic construction, more actively fight against the old and outdated things, and warmly support all new and advanced things.

In the Soviet Union, there are the most complete conditions for carrying out mass cultural work among young people. Now, there are a total of 45,000 rural clubs, 4,500 district cultural palaces, more than 380,000 libraries, more than 30,000 reading rooms, 51,000 sets of film projection equipment, and more than 11,000 trade union clubs and cultural palaces. Many Youth League organizations have carried out content-rich mass cultural work among young people. However, there are still many shortcomings in this regard. Xie Yuli pointed out that we often say that the Youth League is the soul of cultural and educational organs. It is necessary to consolidate this honor with concrete work, such as: ensuring that mass cultural work is carried out on a larger scale among young people, organizing mass festive activities, organizing games, carnivals, dances, masquerade parties, organizing youth holiday evenings, visits and trips.

When Xie Yuli talked about the sports aspect of young people, he pointed out that the number of athletes nationwide has almost doubled in the past four years. Millions of young people participated in sports competitions. Soviet youth have victoriously maintained the honor of their motherland in sports in international competitions. However, there are still many young people who do not participate in sports activities; do not participate in the national labor defense system comprehensive tests and sports competitions. To further develop sports and sports, it is required to expand sports equipment and increase the production of high-quality sports equipment. In 1954-1955, it is necessary to mobilize young people to build the simplest sports fields and establish shooting ranges in various district centers and collective farms. Youth League organizations should do their best to help the "Association for the Promotion of the Soviet Army, Navy and Air Force" and pay attention to cultivating young people who can assume the duties of the Soviet army.

Xie Yuli talked about the work of various international democratic youth organizations, and talked about the struggle of youth in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependencies for their rights, for peace, and for the friendship of peoples of all countries. Soviet youth actively participate in the work of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students. Soviet youth organizations regularly exchange delegations with foreign youth organizations, exchange publications, and introduce various situations. From 1949 to 1953, 236 foreign youth delegations visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee. In 1953 alone, 3,746 young people from 55 countries visited the Soviet Union. Our athletes participated in the large-scale sports competitions of the 15th Olympic Games, participated in various European championship and world championship competitions, and conducted friendly matches with athletes from many countries. From 1949 to the present, Soviet athletes have shown their skills in sports fields and gymnasiums in 19 countries. Athletes from 29 countries visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of our sports organizations.

The active struggle of Soviet youth for peace and against the threat of new wars has won the love and trust of millions of young men and women in all countries of the world. The task of the Youth League and all Soviet youth is: in the future, we will still be the vanguard of progressive youth in the world.

Xie Yuli talked in detail about how to lead Youth League organizations. During the period covered by the summary report, the Youth League expanded to twice its original size, with a total of 431,000 grassroots organizations and 18,825,327 members. The composition of members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League can be explained by the following main materials: workers account for about one-quarter, collective farmers account for 13.2 percent, and students from various schools and technical schools account for 38 percent. Among the members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, there are 271,000 technicians and engineers, 455,000 teachers, more than 51,000 agronomists and animal husbandry technicians, and 892,000 university students. One out of every five Youth League members has received higher education or secondary education. The summary reports and re-election work carried out by the Youth League organizations before the convening of the congress demonstrated the high enthusiasm of Youth League members. More than 2 million Youth League members attended the summary report and re-election meetings, delegate meetings, and congresses. As a result of the summary reports and re-elections, hundreds of thousands of Youth League activists participated in the leading bodies of Youth League organizations. Our task is to do our best to improve the work of the Youth League and raise the level of leadership of Youth League organizations. It is necessary to eliminate the shortcomings in the work of Youth League organizations as soon as possible, such as not adhering to the principle of collective leadership, bureaucracy, and commandism. Every leading staff must regularly go deep into the grassroots organizations to provide them with practical assistance. It is necessary to change the structure of the Youth League organizations so that the leading staff have more time to be in regular contact with Youth League members and lower-level organizations.

Xie Yuli concluded by saying that the entire life of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League is inextricably linked to the Communist Party. Following the wise instructions of the Party, and under the constant leadership of the Party, the Youth League has gone through a long road, grown stronger, and become tempered in battle. It has cultivated millions of Soviet patriots who are infinitely loyal to the Soviet motherland. For Youth League members, there is nothing more glorious than selflessly serving the cause of the Communist Party and participating in the struggle to realize communism.

    在苏联青年团第十二次代表大会上
    谢列平作青年团中央总结报告
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记亚·谢列平十九日在青年团第十二次代表大会上作了青年团中央委员会总结报告。
    谢列平说，苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会是在强大的政治高涨和劳动高涨下，在为我们祖国进一步的繁荣而展开全民斗争的情况下召开的。
    苏联人民在党的领导下，满怀信心地沿着共产主义的道路前进。共产党建立和培育起来的列宁共产主义青年团，是党的忠实助手和战斗后备军。谢列平说，共产党中央委员会对青年团代表大会的贺词，又一次明显地说明了党对青年团、对苏联青年的特别关怀。他代表到会的全体代表向党中央委员会保证：青年团将光荣地尽到它对苏联人民、对亲爱的社会主义祖国的神圣责任。
    谢列平讲到青年团员和青年参加共产主义建设的情形。青年团员和青年在工业和农业中都树立了忘我劳动的榜样。优秀的工业革新者和农业先进工作者——瓦·库切尔、叶·斯塔罗图布采夫、安·苏波京、符·扎哈罗夫、尼·奇基列夫、社会主义劳动英雄瓦·叶利谢耶夫、丽·科拉别尔尼科娃、安·让达罗娃、奥·阿加弗诺娃、玛·列夫钦科、格·穆哈诺夫、社会主义劳动英雄瓦·沃尔奇辛和纳·列娃、两次获得社会主义劳动英雄称号的尼·斯米尔诺娃以及许多其他的人，在全国都很闻名。青年团员和全体苏联青年积极参加实现党和政府关于急速提高农业和日用品生产的措施。但是，如果看不到许多青年团组织的工作水平落后于生活的要求，落后于党所提出的任务，那是错误的。主要的缺点之一是，最近几年内青年团组织参加国家建设和经济建设是不够的。许多青年团组织故步自封于青年团内部的事务，脱离了生产生活，脱离了为完成各企业、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的生产计划的斗争，没有表现出应有的主动精神和战斗性。青年团工作人员缺乏工业和农业生产的基本知识，因而严重地妨碍了工作的进行。如果对工农业生产缺乏基本知识，要具体而正确地指导青年团组织的工作，领导它们参加经济活动，那是不能想像的。
    马林科夫同志在莫斯科市列宁格勒选区的选民大会上发表演说时说：“我们的迫切任务是：要使对大力提高劳动生产率的关怀真正成为进一步发展国民经济的一切实际领导工作的中心。必须展开一个真正广泛的全民运动，以争取大大提高劳动生产率，争取将每一个工业企业、每一个建筑工地、每一个运输部门、每一个集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站，即我们伟大的社会主义建设的各个战线上的劳动生产率提到高度的水平。”
    我们的任务是：热烈地响应这个号召，以战斗的精神展开争取劳动生产率新的高涨的社会主义竞赛。青年团组织应当积极地克服劳动组织方面的缺点，和不生产的停歇现象进行斗争，争取各企业均衡地进行工作，更大力地帮助党组织实现生产的全面机械化推广新技术改进技术过程，推广先进的劳动组织法。青年团组织应当力求工业、运输部门和建筑工地的全体青年工人积极参加社会主义竞赛，坚决为精简节约、为发掘和充分地使用生产潜力、为生产高质量产品而斗争。
    谢列平接着说，苏联青年们非常兴奋地迎接了党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议，会议提出了一项当前最迫切的全民任务：在社会主义工业大力高涨的基础上，于最近两三年内急速提高整个农业部门。党中央委员会二—三月全体会议着重指出，在这项工作中，进一步发展作为整个农业生产基础的谷物生产具有特别重大的意义。苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议批准了青年团的创议：从青年团员和青年中动员十万名机器操使者自愿去开垦生荒地和熟荒地。已经有六万名青年团员到开垦地区去了，而申请参加开垦工作的青年共有四十万人。这就是我们光荣的苏联青年的高度的爱国主义的证明。青年团组织正在发起社会主义竞赛，推广先进的劳动生产方法以及农业科学和农业实践中的最新成就。党中央委员会九月全体会议后，约有二十万名青年团员到饲畜业中去从事固定工作。约有一万名青年农业专家和一万六千多名青年机器操使者回到了乡村。
    为了保证青年更加积极地参加实现党和政府在农业方面所提出任务，必须更加熟练地和深入地领导农村青年团的组织。谢列平说，青年团组织应当努力广泛地推广先进的农业技术方法，尽速采用和掌握谷物轮种制，提高田间工作的质量，缩短田间工作的期限，注意改进种籽培育工作，遵守播种的各种定额，大大增加地方肥料的积存量和施用量，以及改进矿质肥料的施用。青年团组织应当经常关心一切牲畜、特别是幼畜的饲养管理，努力提高牲畜的产品生产率。必须更加注意牲畜饲料基地，努力扩大饲料谷物的播种面积，并提高其单位面积产量，无条件完成储存多汁饲料的任务，办法是增加青储饲料、特别是玉蜀黍的播种量，并提高其单位面积产量。
  　机器拖拉机站是发展农业中具有决定性的力量，是国家领导集体农庄的最重要的据点。机器拖拉机站中的青年团组织比过去更加积极地参加了生产工作。机器拖拉机站及其所服务的集体农庄的青年团组织之间的联系和合作日益加强。然而，尽管二百万机器拖拉机站工作人员大军中大部分是青年，但许多青年团领导机构，首先是卡卢加、图拉、奥勒尔、坦波夫、莫洛托夫、明斯克等州的青年团州委会，很少关心机器拖拉机站青年团组织的工作。青年团组织应当改进在青年机器操使者中的工作，设法使每一个青年机器操使者很好地完成每天的工作定额，保证他们所耕作的土地得到丰收。必须关心使青年机器操使者通晓培植农作物的先进方法，经常研究新的技术。
    党中央委员会和苏联部长会议今年一月在克里姆林宫召开的全苏机器拖拉机站工作人员会议，号召所有的机器操使者展开社会主义竞赛，争取农业进一步的高涨。谢列平说，我们的任务是吸引所有的青年机器操使者参加这一竞赛。青年团员—青年拖拉机工作队的竞赛应当成为这一竞赛中的不可缺少的组成部分。
    不久以前举行的苏共中央全体会议揭发了国营农场工作的重大缺点，指出了急速提高国营农场生产的道路。在大多数国营农场中，都有人数众多的青年团组织。青年团领导机构必须纠正对国营农场青年团组织的工作漠不关心的态度，应当提高它们在国营农场工作中的作用和对农场情况的责任心，发动所有的青年团员和青年争取大大降低产品成本，争取每一个国营农场的工作都有赢利，协助党组织把国营农场变成模范的、能生产很多商品粮的农场。
    现在比过去任何时候都更迫切地要求所有的青年团工作人员掌握农业生产知识，熟悉集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作。必须使所有的青年团员工作人员毫无例外地认真研究农业科学的基本知识和先进经验，并坚决使这些知识和经验能在农业生产中得到推广。
    报告很大一部分谈到国民教育问题和学校中青年团组织的工作。由于党和政府经常不断的关心，我国的中学、技术学校和高等学校年年都在增加，教科书出版量和学校设备也不断在增加。现在苏联有五千七百多万学生，比一九四○年多八百万人。高等和中等专门学校的学生有三百多万。任何一个资本主义国家都没有而且也不可能有如此规模巨大的国民教育。资本主义国家的统治阶级希望劳动群众愚昧无知。美国就是一个明显的例子，在那里有一千多万文盲。
    青年团和苏联学校共同担负着教育和培养儿童这一崇高而重大的任务。谢列平指出，青年团组织在帮助教师使学生得到渊博而牢靠的知识。他接着指出了这方面存在的严重缺点。青年团组织在改进学校的教学和教养工作方面，起的作用很不够。在许多学校，仍然存在着青年团员和少年先锋队员负担过重的现象，经常举行令人厌倦的会议和大会，使学生浪费很多时间。学校的青年团和少年先锋队组织，不可能而且不应当重复教师所做的工作。应当吸引学生参加实验小组和技术小组，吸引他们预备实物教育教材，充实教室的设备，参加实验室工作和学校附设实验区的工作，帮助进行工艺教育。应当经常组织学生举行竞赛、晚会、运动会和旅行，以帮助他们扩大眼界，更加深入地掌握知识。
    青年团州委会、区委会、各加盟共和国青年团中央委员会以及学校的青年团组织，应当改进培养学生的工作，使他们具有忠诚和老实、集体主义、同志爱、友谊等高尚道德品质；防止学生染上自私、懒惰和顽皮等坏品质和坏习惯；纠正学生不端正的品行。应当更多地协助学校使青年一代很好地掌握共产主义道德的基本原则，并能融会贯通，运用到生活中去。要解决这一任务，不仅必须在每一个学校、每个青年团和少年先锋队组织内造成一种集体对无纪律的现象不容忍的气氛，而且首先应当想些对儿童有益而且使他们发生兴趣的办法，在休息日在学校、公园、花园、游艺园和住宅庭院中替儿童和少年组织各种游戏和娱乐。少年先锋宫、少年自然学家站、少年技师站、儿童铁道和体育学校在这方面应起重大的作用。
    谢列平说，必须更好地教育学生爱好体力劳动，教会他们把学校里得到的知识用于实际，帮助学生研究工农业生产的基本知识。
    必须提高教师中的青年团组织在教学和培养学生工作中的作用，更多地注意对青年教师的政治思想教育，帮助他们顺利地掌握教育技术，更加积极地吸引他们参加学校青年团和少年先锋队组织的工作。
    列宁少年先锋队组织，在苏联学校生活中占着重要的地位。数百万少年先锋队员在学习中表现了优良的成绩。有不少这样的少年先锋队分队，它们的队员不断进步，它们经常进行各种教育工作。然而，少年先锋队组织的工作存在着重大的缺点。许多队里的工作流于千篇一律，形式单调，规定得太多，组织得太多。在许多分队里，少年先锋队组织的独立性受到侵犯。成年人把孩子的事情都包办代替了。少年先锋队员没有机会在实际工作中表现自己的能力、创造性和才干。在培养少年先锋队员具有独立解决力所能及的实际任务的能力方面，做得很差。大家知道，少年先锋队组织的任务之一是协助学校使学生掌握知识，但是个别的青年团工作人员、少年先锋队指导员和教师没有正确地执行这一要求，甚至曲解这一要求。
    必须消灭少年先锋队组织的工作中的缺点，以改进每个队和每个分队的工作。一切工作都要通过少年先锋队员的主动性和独立性来进行，要进行得生动活泼而有趣。
    高等教育在我国获得广泛的发展。仅是去年一个学年中，就有五十万专家在高等学校和技术学校毕业。他们的学习水平也在不断提高。但是，在高等学校和中等专门学校的青年团组织的工作中还有着严重的缺点。一部分学生学习得不深入，不能按期完成学习作业，常旷课或不做作业。青年团组织对学生的教育不够，不能使他们充分了解自己对国家的责任，以及使他们有充分准备来完成祖国所需要的任何一种工作。
    谢列平着重指出了在由社会主义逐渐向共产主义过渡的时期青年团组织对青年进行思想工作的意义。青年团的使命就是以苏维埃爱国主义精神、各族人民友好精神、无产阶级国际主义精神来教育男女青年，使他们成为为实现共产党的政策而奋斗的不屈不挠的战士。由于党和团进行了巨大的教育工作，出色的、青年的共产主义建设者一代成长起来了。千百万青年献出了自己的力量和知识，来求得祖国的繁荣和争取苏联人的幸福。在思想工作中同样也有着严重的缺点。在理论学习中还存在有教条式的和被动性的学习态度。青年们常常断章取义，搬弄教条。我们应该使青年们不要死记一些公式或引语，而要掌握马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的实质。宣传工作和共产主义建设任务结合得不好，和各州、各边疆区、各共和国以及各企业、机器拖拉机站、集体农庄的具体工作结合得不好。
    青年团组织应该不懈地培养青年们具有苏维埃人的崇高的道德品质，教育他们对自己的行为负责、对祖国要有公民责任感，教育苏联青年们确立互相之间的同志关系，对朋友忠诚，对长者尊敬。我们要做到，使我们的青年、青年团员的品行无论是在街道上、家庭中或公共场所都要成为表率。应该使男女青年们日常在劳动中和生活中表现的崇高与忘我的品德成为全体青年的财产。
    政治鼓动在青年团组织对青年进行共产主义教育的工作中占重要的地位。必须保证使最有修养的青年团员们积极参加群众鼓动工作，选拔鼓动员，在青年工作队、工作班、宿舍、田间营、饲畜场、国营农场各部门中进行工作。青年团应在青年中采用这样一些鼓动工作的方式，如青年鼓动队、“流动报”、“战斗小报”、“快报”等等。
    谢列平指出，报纸、文化教育机构、艺术作品、电影、体育活动和运动在对青年进行共产主义教育方面有很大作用。他指出，必须更加广泛和更加充分地利用所有这些方式。青年团的报纸要反映青年们在青年团组织中各方面的生活，揭露缺点，发动青年完成共产党提出的任务。我们有不少好的报纸和杂志得到青年们普遍的欢迎。但是，在青年报刊工作中还有着重大缺点：它们所刊载的文章的思想水平和文字水平很低，许多言论很肤浅。谢列平说道，必须把青年报纸和杂志的工作提高到共产党报刊的水平，青年报刊应该很好地启发青年团员参加政权建设和经济建设，更积极地与旧的、陈腐的事物作斗争，热烈地支持一切新的、先进的事物。
    在苏联，有在青年中进行群众文化工作的最充分的条件。现在，全国共有四万五千个农村俱乐部、四千五百个区文化宫、三十八万以上的图书馆、三万多阅览室、五万一千套电影放映设备、一万一千多工会俱乐部和文化宫。许多团组织在青年中进行了有内容的群众文化工作。但是，在这方面还存在着许多缺点。谢列平指出，我们常说，青年团是文化教育机关的灵魂。必须以具体工作巩固这个荣誉，如：保证在青年中进行更大规模的群众文化工作，组织群众的节日活动、组织游艺会、狂欢节、舞会、化装舞会，组织青年假日晚会、参观和旅行。
    谢列平谈到关于青年的体育方面时指出，全国运动员的人数在最近四年中几乎增为两倍。千百万青年参加了运动比赛。苏联青年在国际比赛中，胜利地保持了自己祖国在运动方面的荣誉。但是还有许多青年没有参加体育活动；不参加国家劳卫制全面测验和运动比赛。要进一步发展体育和运动，就要求扩大运动设备，增加优等运动器材的生产。在一九五四—一九五五年，必须发动青年们在各区中心、集体农庄中建设最简单的运动场，建立打靶场。青年团组织应当尽力帮助“苏联陆海空军促进协会”，注意培养青年能够担负苏联军队的职务。
    谢列平讲到各种国际民主青年组织的工作，讲到资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的青年为自己的权利、为和平以及各国人民的友好而进行的斗争。苏联青年积极地参加世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会的工作。苏联的青年组织经常和外国的青年组织互派代表团，交换出版物以及介绍各种情况。从一九四九年到一九五三年，有二百三十六个外国青年代表团应苏联青年反法西斯委员会的邀请访问了苏联。仅仅一九五三年，就有五十五个国家的三千七百四十六名青年访问了苏联。我们的运动员参加了第十五届奥林匹克运动会大规模的运动比赛，参加了各项欧洲冠军和世界冠军的比赛，并和许多国家的运动员进行了友谊赛。从一九四九年到现在，苏联运动员在十九个国家的运动场上和体育馆中显了身手。二十九个国家的运动员应我国体育团体的邀请访问了苏联。
    苏联青年们为和平与反对新的战争威胁而进行的积极斗争，获得世界各国千百万青年男女的热爱和信任。青年团和苏联全体青年的任务是：今后我们仍将为世界进步青年的先锋队。
    谢列平详细地讲到如何领导青年团组织的问题。青年团在总结报告所涉及的这段时期中，扩大为两倍，共拥有四十三万一千个基层组织，一千八百八十二万五千三百二十七名团员。苏联列宁共产主义青年团的团员成分可由下列的主要材料说明：工人约占四分之一，集体农民占百分之十三点二，各学校和技术学校的学生占百分之三十八。在苏联列宁共产主义青年团的团员中，有二十七万一千名技术人员和工程师，四十五万五千名教师，五万一千多名农艺师和饲畜师，八十九万二千名高等学校学生。每五个青年团员中有一个团员受过高等教育或是中等教育。青年团组织在代表大会召开前进行的总结报告和改选工作，说明了青年团员的高度的积极性。有二百多万青年团员出席了总结报告和改选的大会、代表会议以及代表大会。由于总结报告和改选的结果，有几十万青年团积极分子参加了青年团组织的领导机构。我们的任务是：尽力改善青年团的工作并提高对青年团组织的领导水平。必须尽速地消灭青年团组织的工作中的缺点，如不遵守集体领导原则、官僚主义和命令主义等。每一个领导工作人员必须经常深入基层组织，对它们进行实际的帮助。必须改变青年团组织的结构，使领导工作人员有更多的时间能和青年团员以及下层组织经常接触。
    谢列平最后说，苏联列宁共产主义青年团整个生命和共产党不可分割地联系着。青年团遵循党的英明指示，在党的经常领导下，走过了漫长的道路，壮大了，百炼成钢了。它培养出成百万个对苏维埃祖国无限忠诚的苏联爱国者。对于青年团员来说，没有再比忘我地为共产党的事业服务和参加实现共产主义的斗争更为光荣的事情了。
