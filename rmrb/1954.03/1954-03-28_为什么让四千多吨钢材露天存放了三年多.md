Letters from Qian Yige and Tian Chunsheng of the Financial Accounting Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government: The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry has a batch of steel, weighing more than four thousand tons and valued at 40.2 billion yuan, which has been stored outdoors in Taiyuan and Yuci, Shanxi, since 1950. No one is responsible for handling it, resulting in a waste and backlog of state assets. Although we have repeatedly reported this to relevant units and leaders, it has not attracted attention. Now we are reporting the situation to you, hoping for an early solution.

This batch of steel was shipped from East China in June 1950. Because of the large quantity and unclear quality and specifications, the Ministry of Heavy Industry planned to organize technicians to analyze and identify it for unified valuation and distribution. In September 1952, when the Central People's Government established the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Heavy Industry did not accept this work. The inventory of this batch of steel, along with two staff members from the Finance Department of the original Ministry of Heavy Industry, was brought to the Finance Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building. At that time, the Central Financial and Economic Commission instructed the Ministry of Heavy Industry to continue to handle this batch of steel. Because the cadres and material inventory originally responsible for handling it were all in the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Heavy Industry forwarded this instruction to the First Ministry of Machine Building. Because it was not within its scope of responsibility, the First Ministry of Machine Building returned it to the Ministry of Heavy Industry. The two ministries pushed it back and forth. In order to handle this batch of materials, the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building convened a meeting in October 1952, inviting the Ministry of Heavy Industry and relevant personnel to discuss it. It was initially decided that the Ministry of Heavy Industry's Sales Bureau would test and distribute the steel, and the Finance Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building would collect and transfer the funds. Because this batch of materials was managed on behalf of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building had difficulties in collecting and transferring funds. Therefore, Cheng Qixing, the acting director of the Supply Bureau, and Tan Wei, the director of the Finance Department, jointly wrote a report to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, hoping that the Ministry of Heavy Industry would be responsible for handling this work, but no reply was received.

We are both supervisory correspondents. In January 1953, after learning about this situation from the comrades who originally kept the inventory of these materials, we reported it to the Supervision Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building. However, the Supervision Office did not handle it in a timely manner, and it was delayed until March before reporting it to the leading comrades of the First Ministry of Machine Building. In April, the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Management Department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry jointly sent people to Taiyuan and Yuci to understand the situation of the steel. The people sent by the Ministry of Heavy Industry looked around and returned. The technicians sent by the First Ministry of Machine Building inspected most of the steel and used a portion of it, but most of it was not processed. On June 2, 1953, the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building reported to the Central Financial and Economic Commission, and the Financial and Economic Commission instructed that the Ministry of Heavy Industry should still be responsible for handling it. However, the Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry raised objections to the Financial and Economic Commission, stating that it could not undertake it, and thus it was delayed again. We learned from the comrades who returned from understanding the situation that the storage condition of the steel was extremely poor. The steel in Taiyuan was all stored in the open, exposed to wind and rain, and the rust was three to four millimeters worse than the original specifications, especially the carbon steel suffered the most damage. The steel stored in Yuci, although slightly better than that in Taiyuan, was also poorly managed.

We believe that this batch of steel has suffered losses to the country due to the long-term lack of responsible handling. The responsibility should be investigated, and relevant departments should be designated to quickly handle it. If it cannot be completely processed for a while, the storage conditions should be improved immediately.

### 为什么让四千多吨钢材露天存放了三年多

    为什么让四千多吨钢材露天存放了三年多
    中央人民政府第一机械工业部财务会计司钱义格、田椿生来信：中央人民政府重工业部有一批重约四千余吨、价值四百零二亿元的钢材，从一九五○年到现在一直在山西太原、榆次两地露天存放着，无人负责处理，造成国家资财的浪费与积压。我们虽然多次向有关单位和领导上反映，但没有引起重视。现在把情况反映给你们，望早日协助解决。
    这批钢材是一九五○年六月由华东运来的。因数量较多，品质及规格也不清楚，重工业部准备组织技术人员进行分析鉴定，以便统一估价、分配。一九五二年九月，中央人民政府成立第一机械工业部、第二机械工业部及地质部时，因重工业部不接受此项工作，这批钢材的清册，随同原重工业部财务司两位经办人员带到第一机械工业部财务司。当时中央财政经济委员会曾指示重工业部继续处理这批钢材。重工业部因原负责处理的干部及物资清册都在第一机械工业部，便把这项指示转给第一机械工业部。第一机械工业部因不属本身职责范围，又退回重工业部。两部就这样互相推来推去。第一机械工业部供应局为了处理这批物资，在一九五二年十月曾召集重工业部及有关人员开会讨论，初步决定由重工业部销售局化验、分配，由第一机械工业部财务司收款、转账。因这批物资是重工业部代管的，第一机械工业部收款、转账有困难，就由供应局程其兴代局长和财务司谭伟司长共同写报告给重工业部，希望由重工业部负责办理这项工作，但没有得到批复。
    我们都是监察通讯员。一九五三年一月，我们从原保管这笔物资清册的同志处了解了这个情况后，就向第一机械工业部监察室作了报告。可是监察室没有及时办理，拖延到三月才向第一机械工业部领导同志作了报告。四月，第一机械工业部供应局和重工业部经理司联合派人到太原、榆次去了解钢材情况。重工业部派去的人，到各地看了一下就回来了。第一机械工业部派出的技术人员，曾检验了大部钢材并利用了一部分，但大部未得到处理。一九五三年六月二日，第一机械工业部供应局向中央财政经济委员会作了报告，并由财委指示仍由重工业部负责处理。但重工业部销售局向财委提出意见，表示无法承办，因而又拖延下去。我们从了解情况回来的同志那里知道钢材保管状况极为恶劣，在太原的钢材全部露天存放，任凭风吹雨打，锈蚀得较原规格差三厘到四厘，尤以炭钢受的损失最严重。存放在榆次的钢材，虽比太原的稍好一些，但也保管得很差。
    我们认为这批钢材由于长期无人负责处理，使国家遭受损失，应该检查责任，并指定有关部门迅速处理。如一时不能彻底处理完毕，也应立即改善保管条件。
