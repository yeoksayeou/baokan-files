    Fujian Province Longyan Special District Commissioner's Office Population Survey and Registration Office, in order to ensure that the district's population survey work achieves the requirements of "no duplication, no omission, comprehensive and accurate," held a meeting of population survey and statistics cadres from all counties in the special district in late February. The meeting deployed a comprehensive re-examination and verification of the district's population survey work after registration. The meeting devoted two days to dividing the cadres present into two groups, separately going to Tieshi Township and Zhongmin Town in Longyan County, where population survey registration work had already been completed, to conduct re-examination and verification. The results showed that there were still many errors in the population survey registration work in these two locations. This made the cadres present aware of the necessity of carrying out re-examination and verification work, and they also learned specific methods for accurately completing the re-examination work in a very short period of time. After the meeting, all counties in the special district successively convened meetings of statisticians from each district to deploy re-examination and verification work. It is expected that by the end of March, the re-examination work in all counties in the special district and the completion of the county-level population survey and registration summary tables will be completed, obtaining statistical figures that are close to completely accurate.

    福建省龙岩专区布置人口复查核实工作
    福建省龙岩专署人口调查登记办公室为了使全区人口调查工作达到“不重复、不遗漏、全面、确实”的要求，在二月下旬召开了一次全专区各县人口调查统计干部会议，布置全专区在人口调查登记后全面进行复查核实工作。会议抽出两天时间将到会干部分成两个小组，分别到龙岩县已完成人口调查登记工作的铁石乡和中民镇进行复查核实，结果发现该两地的人口调查登记工作仍有不少差错。这使到会干部认识了进行复查核实工作的必要性，同时也学会了如何在很短的时间内精确地完成复查工作的具体办法。会议结束后，该专区各县都已相继召开了各区统计员会议，部署复查核实工作。预计到三月底，全专区各县的复查工作和县一级的人口调查登记综合表的填写工作将全部完成，取得接近完全准确的统计数字。　　（新华社）
