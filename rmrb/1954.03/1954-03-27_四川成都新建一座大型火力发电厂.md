To meet the growing needs of industrial construction in the Chengdu area, a large thermal power plant is under construction in Chengdu. Upon completion of the first phase of the power plant, its power generation capacity will be approximately equal to the total existing power generation capacity of the Chengdu and Guanxian areas.

    The auxiliary works of the new power plant officially began construction last October. To meet the tasks of the main plant building and electromechanical installation engineering, the power plant construction office has recently expanded its organization. The Southwest Electric Power Administration will transfer and train a group of technicians and operation workers from various power plants to support the construction and subsequent production of the plant. The Sichuan Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau will mobilize a group of experienced rebar workers and concrete workers, and prepare concrete mixers, water pumps, and other mechanical construction equipment to support the construction of the power plant. Currently, the main power generation equipment such as steam turbines and boilers have been transported to the site, and large quantities of steel, cement, wood, bricks, and other building materials, as well as equipment and materials needed for power generation, are being transported in a steady stream. The first phase of the new power plant will be completed and begin generating electricity by the end of this year or early next year.

    四川成都新建一座大型火力发电厂
    为了适应成都地区工业建设日益发展的需要，成都市正新建一座大型火力发电厂。电厂的第一期工程完成后，发电能力约等于成都、灌县地区现有发电能力的总和。
    新建电厂的附属工程已于去年十月正式施工。电厂建设处为了迎接主厂房和机电安装工程任务，最近又扩充了机构。西南电业管理局将在各电厂抽调和训练一批技术人员和运行工人，支援该厂的建设和以后的生产。四川省建筑工程局将调集一批有经验的钢筋工和混凝土工，准备好混凝土搅拌机、抽水机等机械施工用具，支援电厂的建设。现在主要发电设备汽轮机、锅炉等已运至现场，大批的钢材、水泥、木材、砖瓦等建筑材料和发电所需要的设备和器材正源源运到。新建电厂的第一期工程将于今年年底或明年年初全部完成，开始发电。
