How Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Arrange Production
Yan Ling

In agricultural production cooperatives, with so many people working together, how is the work done? Won't it become a "tangled mess," with all sorts of things getting mixed up?

This is indeed a problem. When farming individually, one decides what to plant on this piece of land and what to plant on that piece of land, what to do today and what to do tomorrow; when it's time to go to the fields, the family can simply divide up the work temporarily. In mutual aid, the number of households is small, and each household basically still decides how to cultivate each piece of land. Agricultural production cooperatives are not that simple. The land, labor, and animal power of many households are unified for use. This household management is much larger than individual farming and mutual aid groups. So, what should be done? There are three solutions to ensure the smooth operation of production in the cooperative: one is to make plans; one is to organize labor; and one is to establish a responsibility system.

Making Plans – Making Preparations

Making plans means making preparations. For example: What crops will the cooperative plant? Which crop will be planted on which piece of land? What varieties will be used? How much more will the yield be compared to the past? What things need to be done to increase production? What water conservancy projects need to be built? How should the soil be improved? How should the terrain be leveled? What farm tools need to be added? How many livestock need to be raised? How much fertilizer needs to be accumulated? How many trees need to be planted? How should technology be improved? What side occupations should be developed? What will be the total income from agriculture and side occupations in a year? All of these need to be considered at the beginning of the year.

After the annual plan is made, a seasonal plan should also be made at the beginning of each farming season. Because it's difficult to think about everything in such detail for the whole year, the annual plan can only point out the goals and general methods of effort. It is not possible to proceed without a general goal, otherwise everyone will not know where to head; but it is not enough to only have a general goal, one must also carefully consider how to go every step of the way. For example, before the start of spring plowing, a spring plowing and planting plan should be made; before summer weeding, a summer weeding, summer harvesting, and summer planting plan should be made; before autumn harvest, an autumn harvest and autumn planting plan should be made; after autumn harvest, a winter production plan should be made. The seasonal plan should specify the quantity, quality, time, labor usage, and specific methods for improving technology for each job. Plans for agricultural capital construction and side-occupation production can also be made on a seasonal basis, coordinated with agricultural production plans, in order to unify the allocation of labor, animal power, and funds.

After a seasonal plan is made, small-segment plans can also be made, that is, plans for four to five days or ten days. In the small-segment plan, all the major and minor tasks for these days should be arranged; what to do first, what to do later, who does this, who does that, when to complete it, etc., should all be clearly defined in advance. This is called "long-term planning, short-term arrangements." With short-term arrangements, the realization of the entire plan is guaranteed.

With a plan for the entire cooperative, each production team (or group) should also make its own team (or group) plan. With the team (or group) plan, it will be clearer who is doing what, and it will be less "chaotic."

Is this too much trouble? Actually, it's not much more trouble than in mutual aid groups and individual farming. Planning is something everyone has to do, and every serious farmer has to have a plan for farming. As everyone often says, "Eating doesn't impoverish, wearing doesn't impoverish, lack of planning leads to lifelong poverty." However, some people plan well, and some people don't plan well. In agricultural production cooperatives, more planning is needed than in the past, because with more people, there is more wisdom, and the planning will be better than in the past. To increase production and increase income, it is worth being a little more "troublesome." When the cooperative is first established, the plan can be simpler, and the aspects covered should not be too many; gradually, with experience, it can be made more detailed.

Is planning just wishful thinking? No. Planning should be made based on the specific conditions of the cooperative. Things that are impossible to achieve should not be included. If they are included but cannot be achieved, everyone will be disappointed, and they will not take the plan so seriously in the future. The plan should not be set too low either; everything that the cooperative can do should be included. If the goal is too low and can be achieved without any effort, then the significance of making a plan is lost.

Once a plan is made, can it not be changed? Can nothing other than what is specified in the plan be done? No. If the situation changes, the plan can be changed after everyone discusses and agrees. Running a cooperative is a new thing. In the beginning, everyone's experience is still very insufficient, and it is inevitable that the annual or seasonal plan will need to be changed halfway through. Even if it needs to be changed, having a plan is still better than having no plan. The plan only includes the main things in the cooperative, and it does not include the individual activities of the members. For example, the cooperative should take into account that members will have some household side-occupation labor, plant some vegetables on their private plots, and visit relatives, etc. Members should not be forced to include things they do themselves that they are unwilling to include in the cooperative's plan.

Organizing Labor – Assigning Teams

With a plan, there must be people to do it. With so many people in the cooperative, the labor force must be well organized.

Organizing labor means assigning teams. For example: those who are suitable for field work should be assigned to the field production team; those who are suitable for raising livestock and poultry should be assigned to the animal husbandry production team. If there are not many livestock and a production team is not needed, various side occupations can be organized together into a side occupation production team; if the cooperative is relatively large and has a lot of land, several field production teams can be divided up, and teams can be further grouped below. Smaller cooperatives, of course, do not need to be divided in this way.

No matter how it is divided, those with leadership ability, technology, and strong labor should be paired up, and each team (or group) should have them. Can people who have good feelings and get along well be assigned to the same team? This can be appropriately taken care of, but not everyone can do whatever they want; if those with strong labor and good technology are all in one team, and other teams lack people with strong labor and good technology, it will not be good. If production is not done well, everyone will suffer.

To strengthen the leadership role of the Party, it is best to appropriately distribute Party members and Youth League members to various teams or groups.

Organizing labor should not be too ambitious; the appropriate organizational form and division of labor should be determined according to the size of the cooperative, the needs of production, the amount of land and labor in the cooperative, and the past experience in collective labor. It can be simpler at first and gradually become more detailed. Making it very complicated all at once, while superficially "scientific," may be harmful to production if everyone lacks experience and production doesn't require it, or at least it will make the members feel that it is too troublesome and inconvenient.

After the teams are assigned, it will be easier to get things done. However, this is not enough. The way labor is used must also have a certain system.

Initially, a temporary division of labor system for production groups can be implemented; that is, each segment of farm work in the entire cooperative is temporarily assigned to several production groups; when this segment of farm work is completed, the division of labor can be re-divided according to the specific situation of other farm work.

After the members have some experience in group division of labor, a system of seasonal contracting of cultivation by fixed production groups or teams can be implemented, that is, the production groups or production teams are fixed, and those people are in one group or one team, which will not change during the year; the farm work of the cooperative, a certain quantity and quality are specified, calculated as a certain number of labor days, and contracted to each group or team seasonally; if it is completed ahead of schedule, the original number of labor days is still recorded.

After the members have more experience in contracting cultivation, and everyone is willing to make further improvements, a system of year-round contracting of cultivation and production by each production group or team can be implemented, that is, a certain plot of land is contracted to each production group or team, specifying a certain yield, which is contracted by each group or team; if that group or team exceeds the specified yield, they will be rewarded according to a certain method; if it is far from the specified yield, it depends on the reason: whether it is because that group or team did not produce well, or because of a natural disaster, or some other reason, and the situation is handled accordingly.

Regardless of which organizational form is adopted to use labor, it must be subject to full democratic discussion by the members; the methods of reward and handling must also be decided by public discussion at the members' congress.

Establishing a Responsibility System – Setting Rules

Establishing a responsibility system means assigning someone to be in charge of everything and setting rules. There are many things in the cooperative and many public properties. If each thing and object is not managed by someone specifically, and there are no rules, some things will not be the responsibility of anyone, some things will be used and thrown away randomly, and the situation of "three monks having no water to drink" will occur.

What kind of responsibility system should be established? This also depends on the specific situation of each cooperative. Generally speaking, there are several responsibility systems that must be established:

1.  Leadership Division of Labor Responsibility System: This mainly refers to the division of labor of the Management Committee. What the director manages, what the deputy director manages, what each committee member is in charge of, who is in charge of production, who is in charge of finance, who is in charge of political education, who is in charge of technology, etc., must all be clearly divided, with dedicated posts and responsibilities. However, it should also be simple and easy to implement, not too complicated, and do not set up nominal positions.

2.  Production Responsibility System: For example, what the field production team manages, what the animal husbandry production team manages, what the side-occupation production team manages, what the captain manages, what each member manages, must all be clearly defined.

3.  Livestock Breeding and Use System, Agricultural Tool Use and Storage System: Who is responsible for breeding and storing each livestock and each agricultural tool, and how to allocate and use them must be the responsibility of a dedicated person.

These systems should not only specify a dedicated person to be responsible but also specify how much responsibility to take and what to do if they are not responsible. That is to say, rules must be set, labor discipline must be set, and methods of reward and punishment must be formulated. These rules are to protect the interests of all members, to fight against absenteeism, miswork, idleness, delays in farming, damage or waste of public property, and other phenomena. These rules must be formulated through democratic discussion by everyone and must be consciously observed by everyone. These rules will not hinder the legitimate freedom of each member.

With a responsibility system and a division of labor, can one ignore things outside of one's division of labor? If an accident occurs temporarily, and the person in charge of this matter is not here, others should still take care of it if they see it; if others' work is not finished, and you finish your work first, you should still help. Having joined the agricultural production cooperative, everyone's interests are completely consistent, and everyone should give full play to the spirit of collectivism at any time and place to do everything in the cooperative well.

    农业生产合作社怎样安排生产
    燕　凌
    在农业生产合作社里，那么多人在一起，怎样做活呢？会不会弄成“一团乱麻”一样，各样事情缠搅不清呢？
    这的确是个问题。在单干的时候，这块地种什么，那块地种什么，今天做什么，明天做什么，自己都想好了；要下地的时候，一家人临时一分工，就可以了。在互助的时候，户数不多，而且每块地怎样种基本上还是各户自己做打算。农业生产合作社就不是那么简单，很多家的土地和劳力、畜力都统一起来使用，这个家务比单干和互助组都要大得多。那该怎么办呢？有办法。要把社里的生产顺顺当当地搞好，办法有三条：一条是订计划；一条是组织劳动力；一条是建立责任制度。
    订计划——做打算
    订计划，就是做打算。比如：社里都要种些什么庄稼？那一种庄稼种在那块地里？用什么品种？要比过去增产多少？为了增产要做些什么事情？要修些什么水利？要怎样改良土壤？要怎样修整地形？要添置什么农具？要喂养多少牲口？要积攒多少肥料？要种植多少树木？要怎样改进技术？要发展什么副业？农业、副业加起来，一年能有多少收入？都要在一年开头的时候就打打算盘。
    一年的计划订好了，还要在每个农事季节开头订出一季的计划。因为一年的事情总难想得那么细致，一年的计划只能给大家指出努力的目标和大体的办法。没有总目标不行，那样大家就不知道是奔向什么地方去；光有总目标也不行，还得把每一段路怎么走都打算周到。比如，春耕开始以前，就要订出春耕春种的计划；夏锄以前，就要订出夏锄、夏收、夏种的计划；秋收以前，就要订出秋收、秋种的计划；秋收以后，就要订出冬季生产的计划。季节计划里边，要把各种活计的数量、质量、时间、劳动力的使用、改进技术的具体办法都订出来。农业基本建设的计划和副业生产的计划也可以按季订，和农业生产计划配合起来，以便统一支配劳力、畜力和资金。
    每季订了计划以后，还可以订出每个小段的计划，也就是四五天到十来天的计划。小段计划里，要把这几天里的整活、零活都安排好；先干什么，后干什么，谁做这件，谁做那件，什么时候完成等等，都要事先弄出个头绪。这就叫做“长计划，短安排。”有了短安排，整个计划的实现就有保证了。
    有了全社的计划，各个生产队（或组）还要订出自己队（组）里的计划来。有了队（组）的计划，什么人做什么事也就更清楚了，就更不会“乱”了。
    这样是不是太麻烦了？其实也不比在互助组和单干的时候麻烦太多。打算是谁都要做的，正经的庄稼人那个也都要有个做庄稼的打算。“吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不到一世穷”，是大家常说的。不过有人打算得好，有人打算得不好就是了。在农业生产合作社里，打算得是要比过去更多一些，因为人多智广，打算得也要比过去更好一些。为了增加生产、增加收入，稍“麻烦”一些也是值得的。才建社的时候，计划可以比较简单一些，方面也不要包括的太多；渐渐地有经验了，就可以订得更详细一些了。
    订计划是不是由社长（主任）或者社里几个干部订呢？他们自然应该多负一些责任，更多用一些心思，可是订计划决不是少数人包办。社里的干部可以提出初步意见，但必须发动全体社员大家讨论。只有这样，才能把大家的智慧集中起来；只有这样，才能把计划订得大家满意；只有这样，才能使大家对社里的事情都更关心；只有这样，才能使大家都充满信心为实现计划而努力。
    订计划是不是空想？不是。订计划是要看着社里的具体条件来订的。不可能做到的事，就不要订进去。订进去实现不了，大家就会失望，以后对计划也就不那么认真了。计划也不能订得太低；凡是社里能办到的事，就要订进去。目标太低了，不费一点力就可以办到，也就失掉订计划的意义了。
    订了计划是不是就不能更改了呢？是不是除了计划上规定的事别的任何事都不能干了呢？不是的。如果情况变了，经过大家讨论同意，计划是可以改变的。办社还是新事情，刚起头，大家经验还很不够，一年的一季的计划到半路要改变是难免的。即使要改变，有计划还是要比没计划强。计划也只是包括社里的主要的事情，并不把社员个人的活动都包括进去。比如：社员要有一些家庭副业劳动，要在自留地上种一些菜，要走亲戚等等，社里都是要照顾到的。社员自己要做的不愿意包括到社里的计划里的事，是不能勉强他们包括进去的。
      组织劳动力——配班子
    有了计划，还得有人做。社里人很多，就得把劳动力组织好。
    组织劳动力，就是配班子。比如：那些人做地里活合适，就分到田间生产队里去；那些人养牲畜、家禽合适，就分配到畜牧生产队里去。如果牲畜不很多，不需要一个生产队，也可以把各种副业放在一起组织成副业生产队；如果社比较大，土地比较多，可以分好几个田间生产队，队下面还可以再分组。比较小的社，当然就不必这样分了。
    不管怎么分，都要把有领导能力的、有技术的、劳力强的，搭配开，每队（或组）都要有。感情比较好、比较对脾气的人能不能分到一块呢？可以适当照顾，可是也不能谁想怎样办就怎样办；如果劳力强、技术好的都到一个队里，别的队却缺少劳力强、技术好的人，就不好了。那样生产搞不好，对大家都是损失。
    为了加强党的领导作用，最好把党员、团员适当地分配到各个队或小组。
    组织劳力，不要贪大架子；要按照社的大小，生产上的需要，社里的土地、劳动力的多少，过去的集体劳动经验怎么样，来决定适当的组织形式和分工办法。最初可以简单一些，渐渐地可以更细致一些。一下子弄得很复杂，表面上看很“科学”，可是大家没经验，生产上也不需要，就会反而对生产有害处，至少也会使社员们觉得太麻烦、不方便。
    配好班子以后，做起活来就可以比较有头绪了。可是，光是这样还不够，劳动力怎样使用也得有一定的制度。
    最初，可以先实行生产小组临时分工的制度；就是把全社每一段农活临时分给几个生产小组来干；干完了这一段农活，要再干别的活的时候，可以按别的农活的具体情况，重新分工。
    社员们有了一些按组分工的经验了，就可以实行常年固定的生产组或队的按季节包耕制，就是把生产小组或生产队固定起来，那些人是一个组或者
  一个队，一年之中不再变动；社里的农活，规定出来一定的数量和质量，算多少劳动日，按季节分给各个组或队包下来；提前完成了，仍然给记原定的劳动日数。
    社员们有了较多的包耕的经验，大家愿意再加改进，就可以实行各生产组或队常年包耕包产制，就是把一定的地段包给每一个生产组或队，规定一定的产量，由每一个组或队包下来；那个组或队超过规定的产量的，按一定的办法奖励他们；如果离规定的相差很远，就要看是什么原因：看是因为那个组或队没有好好生产，还是因为受了天灾，或者是别的什么缘故，看情形加以处理。
    不管采取那种组织形式使用劳动力，都要经过社员充分的民主讨论；奖励和处理的办法，也都要由社员大会公议决定。
    建立责任制度——定规矩
    建立责任制度，就是事事物物有人专管，并且定出规矩来。社里的事情很多，公共的财物也很多，如果各样事情和物件没有人专管，没有个规矩，有些事情就会没人负责，有些东西就会乱用乱扔，就会发生“三个和尚没水吃”的情形。
    要建立些什么责任制度呢？这也要看各社的具体情况来决定。一般地说，有这几种责任制度是一定要建立起来的：
    一、领导分工责任制度：主要是指管理委员会的分工，主任管什么事情，副主任管什么事情，各个委员各分管什么事情，谁管生产、谁管财务、谁管政治教育、谁管技术等等，都要分得一清二楚，专职专责。不过，也要简明易行，不可太复杂，也不要虚设名目。
    二、生产责任制度：比如，田间生产队管那些事情，畜牧生产队管那些事情，副业生产队管那些事情，队长管那些事情，各个队员各管那些事情，都要划分清楚。
    三、牲畜饲养和使用制度、农具使用和保管制度：每一头牲口、每一件农具，归谁饲养、保管，怎样分配使用，都要有专人负责。
    这些制度，不但要规定专人负责，还要规定负多大责，不负责该怎么办。也就是说，要定出规矩来，定出劳动纪律来，订出奖励、惩罚的办法来。这些规矩是保护全体社员的利益的，是为了和无故缺工、误工、窝工、耽误农时、损坏或浪费公共财产等等现象作斗争。这些规矩要经过大家民主讨论规定出来，也要大家自觉地遵守。这些规矩决不妨害每个社员的正当的自由。
    有了责任制，分了工，个人分工以外的事是不是就可以不管了呢？如果临时发生了什么事故，该管这个事的人不在这里，别人看到了也还是应该管的；别人的事情做不完，自己先做完了，也还是应该帮忙的。参加了农业生产合作社，大家的利害是完全一致的，大家应该随时随地发挥集体主义的精神，把社里的每一件事都办好。
