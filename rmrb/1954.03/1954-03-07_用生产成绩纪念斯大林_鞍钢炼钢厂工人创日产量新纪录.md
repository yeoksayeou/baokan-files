Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 6th: Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant set the highest daily output record since the plant opened on March 5th—the first anniversary of the death of Comrade Stalin, the great teacher and friend of the Chinese people. On this day, they produced several hundred tons more high-quality steel than originally planned, 2.2% more than the previous highest record set on February 20th, bringing the utilization coefficient of furnace hearth area to 7.68 tons per square meter for the entire plant.

On the No. 4 open hearth furnace, workers in Group B, led by Shan Changju, a famous steelmaking expert and model furnace foreman at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, created good steelmaking conditions for Group D in response to the leadership's call to commemorate Stalin by smelting more high-quality steel. Therefore, on the 5th, workers in Group D, led by furnace foreman Guan Shu'en, brought the power of the entire group into play, quickly adjusted the temperature, repaired the furnace, and produced two heats of steel in eight hours. Workers in Groups A and B also completed their steelmaking time ahead of schedule, enabling the No. 4 open hearth furnace to produce four heats of steel on the 5th alone, setting a new record in the steelmaking plant for more than a year since the furnace hearth was renovated. On this day, workers at the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 6 open hearth furnaces also produced one more heat of steel than originally planned.

    用生产成绩纪念斯大林
    鞍钢炼钢厂工人创日产量新纪录
    【新华社鞍山六日电】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂的工人在三月五日——中国人民伟大的导师和朋友斯大林同志逝世一周年纪念日，创造了开厂以来日产量的最高纪录。这一天他们比原订计划多生产了数百吨优质钢，比二月二十日所创造的最高纪录还要多百分之二点二，使全厂每一平方公尺炉床面积利用系数达到七点六八吨。
    在四号平炉上，鞍山钢铁公司著名的炼钢能手、模范炉长单长巨带领下的乙班工人，为了回答领导上提出的以冶炼更多的优质钢来纪念斯大林的号召，为丁班创造了炼钢的良好条件。因此，在五日这一天，丁班工人在炉长关书恩带领下，发挥了全班工人的力量，很快地调整好温度，补好炉子，在八小时内炼出了两炉钢。甲班、乙班的工人也提前完成了炼钢的时间，使得四号平炉在五日一天内就出了四炉钢，创造了炼钢厂改造炉床后一年多来的新纪录。在这一天，一号、二号、六号平炉工人也比原来计划多出了一炉钢。
