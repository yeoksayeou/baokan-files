Several Experiences of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative
	Cheng Guangxian Wang Chuandian Lü Hongtai
	The Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in November 1951 on the basis of a year-round mutual aid team. It started with only five households, but because it produced more grain, demonstrating the superiority of the cooperative, more and more farmers requested to join. By the autumn of 1952, it had increased to fifty-nine households. In 1953, it overcame various natural disasters and achieved an all-round bumper harvest. After studying the general line, it expanded to eighty-six households, and the land increased from more than 700 mu to more than 1,000 mu, with the number of households and land accounting for more than 70% of the total number of households and total land area in the village. Since its establishment, the cooperative has accumulated many experiences and lessons.
	
	Cautiously Handle Membership Issues
	Land pooling is a characteristic of agricultural production cooperatives and also the first important issue in running a cooperative, which must be handled with caution. Initially, the cooperative divided the land into four grades according to soil quality and distance from the village. All the land of the cooperative members was pooled, and the vegetable gardens were also planted together. This method was both troublesome and difficult to achieve fairly and reasonably. The vegetable garden was public, and because there was no good management method, it resulted in a phenomenon of someone eating vegetables but no one managing them. The celery field was full of weeds and no one pulled them, and the cucumbers were picked before they were ripe, and no seeds were left. Based on this situation, the cooperative redistributed the vegetable gardens to the members for their own management. When expanding the cooperative, after discussion, it was determined that the land would be pooled based on the average annual output, taking into account the distance of the land, and it was stipulated that each member could reserve a certain number of vegetable gardens. Everyone agreed to this method, except for Lü Fengyi, who said that his mother's "retirement land" was not willing to join the cooperative and wanted to keep it for his own cultivation. The cooperative allowed it. As a result, he used the good fertilizer he had accumulated on his reserved land, reducing the quantity and quality of public manure and affecting the increase in production in the cooperative. These facts show that the cooperative must reserve vegetable gardens for members to grow and eat themselves; however, the reserved land should not be too much.
	Livestock pooling is an issue that must be carefully addressed. The experience of the Lü Hongbin cooperative is that livestock used for cultivating land should be raised by the cooperative; small donkeys used for grinding flour should be fed by the members themselves. Due to lack of experience, the cooperative, when expanding, priced all the privately owned donkeys of the members and pooled them, sharing the burden equally according to the pooled land, and sold the original small donkeys and bought large donkeys. These donkeys were rarely used for planting, and were usually used by the members for grinding flour. However, because the number of donkeys was small, and more members used the donkeys for grinding, many chaotic situations and disputes arose. When using the donkeys, everyone picked the good ones, and a small gray donkey became ill from exhaustion, while some old donkeys were idle in the trough all day long. On rainy days or the day before plowing, members competed to use the donkeys in order to make pancakes, which sometimes hindered plowing. Some women, because they could not get a donkey, cursed and said, "If I can't get a donkey, I'll cut off its ears!" Members only cared about using the donkeys to grind flour, and did not care about feeding them, resulting in the donkeys losing weight, losing money, and causing anger. Later, after learning from this lesson, the cooperative returned the donkeys to the members at a price, and the money lost was borne by the cooperative. After the donkeys were privately raised by the members, they were all fed very well, and six more were added. The cooperative has eight cows that are public, and a dedicated person is responsible for feeding them. If a member's private donkey is used for plowing, the member will be given reasonable remuneration. This not only ensures the completion of the cultivation task, but also reduces the burden on the cooperative and avoids disputes among members caused by the use of donkeys.
	According to the experience of the Lü Hongbin cooperative, the members' large farm implements (plows, harrows, seeders, etc.) can be evaluated and pooled; according to the economic conditions of the cooperative, new-style farm implements such as waterwheels, walking plows, weeding hoes, and sprayers can be added. These are all public property of the cooperative. The members' old-fashioned small farm implements should not be universally priced and turned over to the public. The Lü Hongbin cooperative initially made all farm implements, large and small, public and used them publicly. Everyone scrambled to use the good ones and put them everywhere randomly. Some people did not even wipe the mud off the hoes after hoeing, and no one was responsible for the damage. Later, it was changed to evaluating and pooling large farm implements, and returning small farm implements to the members for private ownership, using them according to labor and personal custody. This overcame the phenomenon of inconvenience in custody due to the large number of farm implements. The experience of the cooperative proves that it is very good to adopt the method of private ownership and public use of small farm implements, with reasonable subsidies for the condition or leasing.
	When the cooperative was first established, it lacked fertilizer, which affected timely sowing, and some members relied on government loans. Later, after discussion, it was decided to mobilize members to invest in the cooperative, with interest subsidies according to the bank's principal-guaranteed deposit method. Under the leadership and promotion of cadres, the members invested more than 5 million yuan, which solved the fertilizer difficulty. Now, the source of fertilizer is partly from the manure accumulated by the public livestock and pigs raised by the cooperative, and partly from assigning fertilizer accumulation tasks to the members according to the situation of each household, which the cooperative purchases at a price. Soybean cakes and chemical fertilizers are mainly purchased with member investment, and some are borrowed from supply and marketing cooperatives.
	
	Do a Good Job in Business Management
	Doing a good job in business management is an important key to running a cooperative well. The Lü Hongbin cooperative gradually improved its business management work in the course of several years of production, and gained several experiences:
	1. To make unified use of land, it is necessary to be good at observing the terrain, familiar with the nature of the soil, and truly do a good job of planting according to the land.
	2. Detailed cost accounting is necessary. In the autumn of 1952, in order to pursue high output, the cooperative blindly applied fertilizer to wheat fields regardless of conditions. The cooperative's 367.8 mu of wheat land alone used 22,000 jin of soybean cake. Coupled with pesticides, seeds, and soil fertilizer, the cost accounted for 91% of the total wheat income. As a result, the output was high, the cost was high, and the dividends were small. The Lü Hongbin cooperative learned from this lesson, and did a reasonable job of fertilizing in the spring planting of 1953, making corn achieve a large-scale bumper harvest. It also calculated the cost in detail when planting wheat in the autumn, requiring low cost and high output.
	3. Labor force should have scientific division of labor. When the cooperative was established, the labor force of the whole cooperative was divided into three groups according to strength: the first group was adult male labor, responsible for the main farming work; the second group was young men and women, responsible for general farming work such as hoeing and thinning seedlings; and the third group was adult women, responsible for seed selection and light work in the field. Later, everyone felt that this division of labor could not give full play to the members' specialties, nor could they teach and learn from each other. After the expansion of the cooperative in 1952, the land of the whole cooperative was divided into four production areas, and the male and female labor force was organized into four production teams, responsible for agricultural production in each area. The production teams then implemented a fixed responsibility contracting system with the production group as a unit. With a general division of labor and fixed responsibilities, the members can learn from each other and supervise each other, so the members' enthusiasm for labor has been significantly improved compared with the past. Recently, 27 more households have been added, and the land and labor force have increased. In order not to cause confusion and affect spring plowing production, five production brigades have been formed according to the principle of convenient production for members, strong and weak labor, basically not moving old members, and interspersing new members. Each brigade is divided into two groups, and land, animal power, farm implements, and fertilizers are allocated according to the specific conditions of each team and group, preparing conditions for the implementation of the production responsibility system.
	4. Piecework recording should gradually be made fair and reasonable. At first, the Lü Hongbin cooperative had few members, and adopted "fixed points and live recording". Regardless of light or heavy work, it was stipulated that each person should not exceed ten points per day. The result was that "people scrambled to do light work, and were unwilling to do heavy work." Later, the restriction of no more than ten points per day was lifted, and everyone was more satisfied. However, after the expansion of the cooperative, there were more laborers, and the members gathered together every night to assess work points. Everyone felt very tired, which hindered production. Members reflected: "It's good to join the cooperative, but it's difficult to assess work points," "It's unbearable to stay up every night." Based on this situation, in the autumn of 1952, the method of "recording work points by piece for single jobs" was changed, which initially solved the phenomenon of wasting time in assessing work points. However, there are many complex and complicated farm jobs in the cooperative, and it is also difficult to assess work points for single jobs by piece. In the spring plowing and sowing of 1953, it was changed to a method of recording work points by piece with fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed work, and fixed time. This method of recording work points is fair and reasonable, and the members' enthusiasm for labor has also been significantly improved. For example, the fixed quantity for harvesting wheat is 80 wheat bundles (15 jin each) for one working day. Generally, the members completed the fixed quantity, and individual members got up early and went to bed late, and the most completed one and a half fixed quantities. According to the experience of the cooperative, the fixed quantity should not be too rigid, and should be discussed democratically and revised at any time with changes in the farm situation.
	5. Pay attention to field management. In the past, the cooperative did not carefully record the work points for odd jobs in the field, so that grain was scattered on the edge of the field, and no one cared about it, letting it rot in vain; in 1952, more than 1,000 jin of corn cobs were missing in the field, which aroused mutual suspicion among the members. Field management has been greatly improved now, but how to record work points for odd jobs has not been completely resolved.
	
	Reasonable Distribution of Dividends
	Dividend distribution is the distribution of the fruits of the members' labor for a year, and the amount of dividend distribution is the main sign for the members to evaluate whether the cooperative is well run. The agricultural dividend distribution method of the Lü Hongbin cooperative is to deduct production costs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, as well as accumulation funds and public welfare funds from the total agricultural income of the year, and distribute them in the ratio of 60% labor and 40% land. Straw is distributed with grain except for the straw reserved for the cooperative's livestock for the whole year. Every season when grain is harvested, it is first pre-paid to each household in proportion, and then summarized and calculated after the autumn harvest. This distribution method was discussed and decided by the members' general meeting based on the situation of the cooperative, and everyone felt that this method is still relatively reasonable at present. In 1953, the cooperative's 718 mu of land harvested a total of 282,148 jin of grain. After deducting costs, accumulation funds, and public welfare funds, the land averaged 82 jin and 10 liang of grain per mu, and each working day averaged 8 jin and 15 liang of grain. The members calculated that both people with more land and less labor and people with more labor and less land increased their income. Member Lü Lunshi has 15 mu of land, and she is the only labor force. In the mutual aid team in 1952, after deducting production costs and wages paid to outsiders, the annual net gain was 2,330 jin of grain; in 1953, she received 2,916 jin and 5 liang in the cooperative. Member You Xi has 10 mu of land, one full labor force, and three and a half labor forces. In the mutual aid team in 1952, the net income was 3,000 jin of grain; in 1953, he received 5,993 jin and 2 liang in the cooperative. Through actual distribution, the members saw that those who worked more and worked better received more grain, and established the concept of more work, more gain. At the same time, they understood that the increase in production in the land was mainly due to labor, and thus gradually increased the demand for remuneration according to labor.
	
	Everyone Runs the Cooperative
	The Lü Hongbin cooperative has always paid attention to implementing the spirit of "everyone runs the cooperative", so that the cooperative has been consolidated and improved. The cooperative is led and managed by the democratically elected cooperative management committee. Major matters must be discussed and approved by the general meeting of all members, and general issues are discussed and resolved at the family representative meeting. Five days before the general meeting of members, the matters to be discussed are notified to all members for full deliberation, so that the opinions of the members' families are as consistent as possible. After the end of each agricultural affair and the end of the season, each production team conducts a production evaluation and leadership review. In order to give full play to democracy, the cooperative management committee has also set up an suggestion box. Many criticisms and suggestions from the members have been received in the suggestion box, which has greatly helped improve the work of the cooperative. In the spring of 1953, some members criticized the director in the suggestion box for running around all day long and being busy at work. Lü Hongbin accepted this criticism, made a self-criticism to everyone, and convened the cooperative management committee to study and improve the leadership work. The suggestion box has become a powerful tool for democratically managing the cooperative. One suggestion form suggested to the management committee: plow the field and the manure yard and plant cabbage; quickly deal with the members' small plots of land; do not plant corn on the headland, so as not to be knocked down by the carts; the wheat in the irrigated land has been pressed down by the soil, so hurry up and support it. Some members criticized the construction team in the suggestion box for not planning properly, and the pigsty was built and then demolished, wasting labor. Some criticized certain cooperative cadres for having a bad attitude and a dragging style. Some criticized a certain member for not working well. Some exposed the behavior of members selling urine fertilizer mixed with water to the cooperative and not taking care of the cattle. Some members also requested help to solve their living difficulties. These opinions enabled the leaders of the cooperative to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The cooperative management committee attached great importance to these opinions, and each opinion had a response and an explanation, and was dealt with according to the actual situation. Some cooperative committee members made self-criticisms, and some suggestions were immediately discussed and implemented. The members generally reflected: "Many people produce sages, this is true democracy!"
	Lü Hongbin has been to the Soviet Union and has seen the lives of Soviet farmers with his own eyes. He has confidence in leading agricultural production cooperatives, and also pays attention to educating members about the socialist future. He also often cares about the lives of the members and helps them solve their difficulties. Therefore, the members feel that the cooperative is like a big family, and they can consciously care for the cooperative, love the cooperative, and work hard to run the cooperative well.

    吕鸿宾农业生产合作社的几点经验
    程光先　王传典　吕鸿泰
    吕鸿宾农业生产合作社，是一九五一年十一月在常年互助组的基础上建立的。开始只有五户，由于多打了粮食，显示了合作社的优越性，农民要求入社的逐渐增多，一九五二年秋天就增加到五十九户。一九五三年战胜了各种自然灾害取得全面丰收。经过总路线学习后，又扩大到八十六户，土地由七百多亩增加到一千多亩，户数和土地都占全村总户数和土地总面积的百分之七十以上。该社从成立以来，有了不少经验教训。
    慎重处理入社问题
    土地入股是农业生产合作社的特点，也是办社的第一个重要问题，必须慎重处理。该社起初是按土质好坏、位置远近把土地分成四等，社员土地全部入了社，菜园地也合种在一起。这种办法既麻烦又不易做到公平合理。菜园是公的，因为没有很好的管理办法，结果形成有人吃菜无人管理的现象。芹菜地里长满了草无人拔，黄瓜不等成熟就摘光了，连种也没有留。根据这个情况，社里就把菜园地仍分给社员自己管理。扩大社时，经大家讨论确定土地以常年产量为基础，适当照顾土地位置的远近评定固定产量入股，并规定每个社员可以自留一定数目的菜园地。大家都同意了这个办法，只有吕凤仪说他娘的“养老地”不愿入到社里，要留出自己耕种。社里也允许了。可是结果他把个人积的好肥料都使到自留地里去了，减少了公有粪的数量和质量，影响社内增产。这些事实说明：办社必须留菜园地，由社员自种自食；但自留地不能太多。
    牲畜入社是一个必须很好注意解决的问题。吕鸿宾社的经验是：用来耕种土地的牲畜由社公养；用作推磨的小驴，由社员自喂。该社由于缺乏经验，在扩大社时将社员私有驴子全部作价入社，按入社土地平均负担，并将原来的小驴卖了，买成大驴。这些驴种地用的很少，平时都是社员用来推磨。可是由于驴的数目少了，社员使驴推磨的多了，便发生许多混乱现象和纠纷。使驴时谁都拣好的使，有条小青驴就这样累病了，而一些老驴却成天闲在槽头上没人用。一到阴雨天或到耕地的前一天，社员为了办下煎饼，都争着使驴，有时反妨碍了耕地。有的妇女因没牵着驴，就骂着说：“我牵不着驴也得割它个耳朵！”社员只顾争着使驴推磨，不关心喂养，结果瘦了驴，赔了钱，惹了气。后来接受了这个教训，社里就把驴子作价退还给社员，赔的钱由社负担。驴子归社员私养后，都喂得很好，并增加了六头。社里有八头牛是公共的，有专人负责喂养。耕地时如用社员私人的驴配犋，就给社员合理的报酬。这样既保证了耕种任务的完成，也减少了社里的负担，避免了社员间因使驴引起的纠纷。
    根据吕鸿宾社的经验，社员的大型农具（犁、耙、耩子等）可评价入社；根据社里的经济条件，可添置新式农具如水车、步犁、耘锄、喷雾器等。这些都是社里的公共财产。社员的旧式小型农具，不宜采取一律折价归公的办法。吕鸿宾社开始将大小农具全部公有公用，大家抢着好的使，到处乱放，有的锄地回来连锄上的泥也不擦，损坏了也无人负责。后来改为大型农具评价入社，小型农具退归社员私有，随劳力使用，个人保管的办法，这样就克服了因农具多，保管不便的现象。该社的经验证明，小农具采取私有公用、合理贴补成色或是租借使用的办法都很好。
    社刚成立时，缺少肥料，影响及时下种，有些社员依赖政府贷款。后来经过大家商量，决定动员社员向社里投资，按银行保本保值存款办法贴息，在干部带头推动下，社员共投资五百多万元，解决了肥料困难。现在肥料的来源一部分是社里公养牲口和猪攒的粪，一部分是根据各户情况分配给社员积肥任务，由社里作价收买。豆饼和化学肥料主要靠社员投资购买，也向供销社借一部分。
    做好经营管理工作
    做好经营管理工作是办好合作社的重要关键。吕鸿宾社在几年的生产过程中逐步改进了经营管理工作，取得了几点经验：
    一、统一使用土地要善于观察地势、熟悉土壤性质，真正做好因地种植。
    二、要详细计算成本。一九五二年秋天，社里为了追求高额产量，就不顾条件盲目地在小麦地里施肥，全社三百六十七亩八分麦地，光豆饼就施了两万两千斤，再加上农药、种籽和土肥，成本占了小麦总收入的百分之九十一。结果是产量高、成本高、分红少。吕鸿宾社接受了这一教训，一九五三年春种时便做到合理施肥，使玉米达到大面积丰产，秋天种麦时也详细计算了成本，要求做到成本低、产量高。
    三、劳动力要有科学分工。建社时，全社劳动力按强弱分成三个组：一组是成年男劳力，负责主要耕种农活；二组是青年男女，负责锄地间苗等一般农活；三组是成年妇女，负责选种和场里的轻活等。后来大家觉得这样分工不能发挥社员的特长，又不能互教互学。一九五二年扩大社后就把全社土地按片划成四个生产区，把男女劳动力组成四个生产队，分别负责各区的农业生产，生产队里又以生产小组为单位实行固定负责的包工制。有了总的分工，责任固定，社员之间既能相互学习又能相互监督，这样社员劳动积极性比以前就有了显著的提高。最近又增加了二十七户，土地和劳动力都增多，为了不造成混乱，影响春耕生产，便按照社员生产便利、劳力强弱、老社员基本不动、新社员分别穿插的原则，组成五个生产大队，每大队又分两个小组，再根据各队和小组的具体条件分配土地、畜力、农具、肥料，为施行生产责任制准备条件。
    四、评分记工要逐步做到公平合理。吕鸿宾社起初社员不多，采用“死分活记”，不管轻活重活，规定每人每日不超过十分，实行的结果产生“轻活抢着做，重活不愿干”的现象。后来取消了每日不超过十分的限制，大家比较满意。但扩大社后，劳力多了，每天晚上社员都挤到一起评工分，大家都感到很疲劳，妨碍了生产。社员反映：“社好参加工难评”，“每晚熬眼受不了”。根据这个情况，一九五二年秋天就改为“单项活按件记工”的办法，初步解决了评工浪费时间的现象。可是社内农活多而复杂，单项的活按件记工评起来也很困难。到一九五三年春耕春种时，又改为定质定量定工定时的按件记工的办法。这样记工方法公平合理，社员劳动积极性也显著提高。如收麦中定量是拔八十个麦（每个十五斤）为一个劳动日，一般社员都完成了定量，个别社员早起晚睡，最多的完成了一个半定量。根据社里经验，定量不能太死，要随着农情的变化，民主讨论，随时修正。
    五、要注意场上管理。以前社里对场上做零活的记工不认真，以致场边上撒了粮食，无人过问，让它白白烂掉了；一九五二年放在场里的玉米棒子，少了一千多斤，引起社员之间的互相怀疑。现在场上管理工作已经有了很大改进，但对零活应如何记工还没有彻底解决。
      合理分红
    分红是社员一年劳动果实的分配，分红多少是社员评定合作社办得好坏的主要标志。吕鸿宾社的农业分红办法是将全年农业总收入扣除种籽、肥料、农药等生产成本和公积金、公益金后，按劳六地四的比例分配。柴草除留出社里全年牲畜用草外，随粮分配。每季粮食打下来，先按比例预支给各户，收完大秋再总结计算。这个分配办法是社员全体大会根据本社情况讨论决定的，大家觉得这个办法在目前还比较合理。一九五三年全社七百一十八亩地共收二十八万二千一百四十八斤粮食，扣除成本、公积金和公益金，土地每亩平均得粮八十二斤十两，每个劳动日得粮八斤十五两。社员们算了一下，地多劳力少和劳力多土地少的人都增加了收入。社员吕伦氏有十五亩地，就只有她一个劳动力，一九五二年在互助组里除去生产成本和向外找的工资，全年净得粮食二千三百三十斤；一九五三年在社里分到了二千九百一十六斤五两。社员尤喜有十亩地，有一个整劳力和三个半劳力，一九五二年在互助组里净收入三千斤粮食，一九五三年在社里分到五千九百九十三斤二两。经过实际分配，社员们看到了劳动多劳动好的分的粮食多，树立了多劳多得的观念，同时也明白了地里增产主要是由劳力加工得来的，因而逐步增加着按劳取酬的要求。
    大家办社
    吕鸿宾社一直注意贯彻“大家办社”的精神，使合作社得到了巩固与提高。社里由民主选举的社务管理委员会负责领导和管理全社的生产。重大事情都要经全体社员大会讨论通过，一般的问题开家庭代表会讨论解决。召开社员大会的前五天，就把要讨论的事情通知全体社员充分酝酿，使社员家庭的意见尽量取得一致。每一农事终了和季节终了，各生产队内都进行一次生产评比和检查领导。为了充分发扬民主，社务管理委员会还设立了意见箱。在意见箱中，收到很多来自社员的批评和建议，对改进社内工作有很大作用。一九五三年春天，有的社员在意见箱里批评社长整天东跑西奔，工作忙乱。吕鸿宾接受了这个批评，向大家作了检讨，并召开社务管理委员会研究改进领导工作。意见箱成了民主管理社务的有力工具。有一张意见书上建议管理委员会：把场地和粪场刨起来种上小白菜；赶快处理社员小片土地；地头上不要种玉米，免得被车子碰倒；水浇地的小麦，有的被土压倒了，要赶快扶起来。有的社员在意见箱中批评建设队计划不周，猪栏修起来又拆了，浪费劳力。有的批评某些社干部态度不好、作风拖拉。有的批评某个社员劳动不好。有的揭发社员向社里卖尿肥掺水，不爱护耕牛等行为。还有的社员要求帮助解决生活困难。这些意见使社内领导干部及时发现了问题，解决了问题。社务管理委员会对这些意见很重视，每条意见都有答复，有交代，根据实际情况分别处理，有的社务委员作了检讨，有的建议立刻讨论执行。社员普遍反映：“人多出圣人，这才真正民主了！”
    吕鸿宾到过苏联，亲眼看到苏联农民的生活，他领导农业生产合作社有信心，也注意对社员进行社会主义前途教育。他还经常关心社员生活，帮助社员解决困难。因此，社员们感到合作社像个大家庭，也能自觉地关心社、爱护社，努力把社办好。
