    Jiangsu Province Develops Large-Scale Freshwater Fish Farming

    This year, Jiangsu Province will vigorously develop large-scale freshwater fish farming to meet the growing needs of the country and the people. Currently, the state-owned Taihu Fish Farm has completed the surveying and design of its aquaculture area and is expanding its existing equipment to increase the aquaculture area by about one and a half times this year. Not long ago, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government sent a group of design personnel to the lake areas north of the Yangtze River to survey new aquaculture centers. Preliminary investigations have shown that more than 80,000 mu of water surface in the Wugong Lake, Dazong Lake, and Pingwang Lake areas of Xinghua County are suitable for fish farming. This survey work is still in progress and will be assisted by technicians dispatched by the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    Jiangsu Province has many lakes and great potential for fish farming. The total lake area in the province is about 15 million mu, of which only about 4 percent is currently being utilized. The vast majority of this is dispersed manual production by individual fishermen, resulting in very low yields. After implementing large-scale fish farming, it is initially estimated that each mu of water surface can produce about 80 jin of fish. This year, in addition to state-owned enterprises developing large-scale freshwater fish farming, the People's Government plans to increase the number of organized fishermen by about three times compared to last year and encourages fisheries production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations to gradually combine and cooperate in fish farming, laying the foundation for the future division of labor and specialization within the collective organizations of socialist large-scale agriculture. These measures will gradually lead the province's freshwater fish farming industry towards large-scale operation and mechanization. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江苏省发展大面积淡水养鱼
    今年江苏省将大力发展大面积的淡水养鱼事业，以适应国家和人民日益增长的需要。目前，国营太湖养殖场已完成养殖面积的勘测和设计，正在扩充原有的设备，使今年的养殖面积扩大一倍半左右。不久以前，江苏省人民政府派出一批设计工作人员到长江以北的湖泊地带，勘测新的养殖中心。经初步查明，兴化县一带的吴公湖、大纵湖、平望湖等，有八万多亩的水面适宜养鱼。现在这一勘测工作仍在进行，并将得到中国科学院水生生物研究所派遣的技术人员的帮助。
    江苏省湖泊很多，养鱼潜在力很大。全省湖泊面积大约有一千五百万亩左右，现在利用的只有百分之四左右。其中极大部分是由个体渔民进行分散的手工生产，产量很低。实行大面积养鱼后，初步估计每亩水面可产鱼八十斤左右。今年，江苏省除由国营企业开展大面积淡水养鱼事业外，人民政府计划使组织起来的渔民比去年增加三倍左右，并鼓励渔业生产互助合作组织和农业生产互助合作组织逐步结合，合作养鱼，为今后社会主义大农业的集体组织内部分工分业打下基础。这些措施，都将逐步使全省淡水养鱼事业走向大规模经营和机械化的道路。　　　（新华社）
