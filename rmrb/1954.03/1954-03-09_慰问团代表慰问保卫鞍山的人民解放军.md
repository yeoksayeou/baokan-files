Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 8th: Representatives of the seventh general sub-delegation and the second sub-delegation of the National People's Comfort Delegation to the People's Liberation Army have been conducting extensive and in-depth慰问 (visits/expressing sympathy and appreciation) to the People's Liberation Army troops guarding Anshan, our country's steel capital, since late February.

The good news of the慰问团 (comfort delegation) arriving in Anshan brought great joy and encouragement to the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Anshan. Soldiers of a certain unit wrote more than 500 letters of thanks to the representatives of the慰问团 (comfort delegation) overnight, and also rehearsed literary and artistic programs they created themselves, preparing to perform for the representatives. Many soldiers also held group discussions under the theme of "Welcoming Relatives." Some companies also arranged cultural learning exhibitions to report their learning achievements to their relatives.

The representatives of the慰问团 (comfort delegation) were warmly welcomed by the soldiers. When the representatives of the慰问团 (comfort delegation) visited a certain unit, Zhang Dongchuan, deputy head of the seventh general sub-delegation of the慰问团 (comfort delegation), and Meng Tai and Wang Chonglun, nationally renowned model workers from Anshan Iron and Steel, who were walking in the front of the representative ranks, were enthusiastically lifted up by the soldiers. Soldiers from some units stood in the wind and snow for several hours to welcome the representatives of the慰问团 (comfort delegation). They said that in order to welcome their relatives and shake their hands, they were not afraid of the cold. During the 慰问 (visit/expressing sympathy and appreciation), the soldiers of a certain unit specially invited the representatives to visit their exercises. The representatives were very excited to see the soldiers' skilled movements and brightly polished weapons. Wang Chonglun said that after returning, he would definitely mobilize all the workers in the workshop to learn from the People's Liberation Army comrades, love the machines, and polish all the machines as brightly and cleanly as the People's Liberation Army's weapons. Meng Tai also said excitedly: "With such a brave and strong People's Liberation Army protecting us, our workers can concentrate on production and actively build the motherland, so as to realize the beautiful socialist society as soon as possible!" He also gave the soldiers photos of himself wearing seven medals on his chest as souvenirs. In return for his kindness, the soldiers also gave Meng Tai their diaries and other gifts.

    慰问团代表慰问保卫鞍山的人民解放军
    【新华社沈阳八日电】全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团第七总分团的代表和第二分团，自二月下旬开始，分别向保卫我国钢都——鞍山的人民解放军部队进行广泛深入的慰问。
    慰问团来到鞍山的喜讯，给人民解放军驻鞍山的部队带来了极大的喜悦和鼓舞。某部战士曾连夜写了五百多封感谢慰问团代表的信件，还排演了他们自己创作的文艺节目，准备为代表们演出。许多战士并以“迎接亲人”为题，进行了小组讨论。有的连队还布置了文化学习展览会，向亲人汇报学习成绩。
    慰问团代表受到了战士们的热烈欢迎。慰问团代表慰问某部时，走在代表行列前面的慰问团第七总分团副团长张东川和全国著名的鞍钢特等劳动模范孟泰、王崇伦，被战士们热情地抬了起来。有些部队的战士为了迎接慰问团的代表，在风雪中站了几个钟头，他们说，为了迎接亲人，握一握亲人的手，再冷也不怕。在慰问期间，某部队的战士们特地请代表们参观他们的演习。代表们看到战士们熟练的动作和擦拭得亮堂堂的武器，都很兴奋。王崇伦表示，他回去后一定要发动全车间工人向解放军同志们学习，热爱机器，把所有的机器也擦得像解放军的武器一样光亮洁净。孟泰也激动地说：“有了这样英勇强大的解放军保护咱们，咱们工人就能安心生产，积极建设祖国，早日实现美好的社会主义的社会啦！”他还把胸前佩有七枚奖章的照片分别送给战士们留念，战士们为答谢他的盛意，也把自己的日记本等礼物送给孟泰。
