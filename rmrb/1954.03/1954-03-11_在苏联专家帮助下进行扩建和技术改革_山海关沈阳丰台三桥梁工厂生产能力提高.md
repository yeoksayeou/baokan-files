With the Assistance of Soviet Experts, Expansion and Technological Transformation Increased the Production Capacity of the Shanhaiguan, Shenyang, and Fengtai Three Bridge Factories

The Shanhaiguan, Shenyang, and Fengtai three bridge factories, with the specific assistance of Soviet experts, have gradually increased their steel beam production capacity through expansion and technological transformation.

In the past, each railway administration had its own bridge factory, and these factories had small production capacity, high costs, and low quality. Last year, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Ministry of Railways concentrated the scattered machinery and equipment in the Shanhaiguan, Shenyang, and Fengtai three bridge factories, so that steel beam production and management tended to be centralized and unified. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, production technology was improved, and the quality of steel beams was enhanced. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, the annual total output value was completed at 106% last year, which was 143% of the total output value in 1952. More than 39,000 square meters of new steel structure workshops were also built. Among them, many new products trial-produced by the Shanhaiguan and Shenyang factories strongly supported the construction of new railway lines. The Shanhaiguan factory manufactured steel beams with spans of 73 and 75 meters for the Xiangjiang Bridge, manufactured 15-ton derrick cranes for the Hanshui Bridge and the Baocheng Railway, and manufactured 65-ton new-style bridge erecting machines for various engineering bureaus. The winches manufactured by the Shenyang factory, especially the 55-meter lower-bearing standard steel truss beams and disassembling beams manufactured by the two factories using the advanced Soviet "machine template method," were the first new steel beams and new tools produced by Chinese bridge factories. The quality of these steel beams manufactured with advanced technology has been unprecedentedly improved, the rods can be interchanged, and the efficiency of manufacturing steel beams has been increased by 65%, paving the way for China to manufacture high-quality standard beams and a large number of steel structures in the future.

In order to promote Soviet advanced experience and exchange the work experience of the three factories, the New Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways convened a factory affairs meeting of various bridge factories in January this year. In addition to summarizing the production situation last year, the meeting also arranged this year's production tasks. This year, the total output value of each factory has increased compared with last year. It is estimated that the Shenyang factory will increase by 2.2%, the Shanhaiguan factory will increase by 3.6%, and the Fengtai factory will increase by 3.27%.

    在苏联专家帮助下进行扩建和技术改革
    山海关沈阳丰台三桥梁工厂生产能力提高
    山海关、沈阳、丰台三个桥梁工厂，在苏联专家具体帮助下，经过扩建和技术改革工作，生产钢梁能力逐渐提高。
    过去，每个铁路管理局都有自己的桥梁工厂，这些工厂生产能力小、成本高、质量低。去年，铁道部根据苏联专家建议，把分散的机具设备集中在山海关、沈阳、丰台三桥梁厂，使钢梁生产和经营管理走向集中和统一，并在苏联专家指导下，改进生产技术，提高了钢梁质量。由于全体职工的努力，去年完成了年度生产总值百分之一百零六，为一九五二年生产总值的百分之一百四十三，还新建钢结构厂房三万九千多平方公尺。其中山海关、沈阳两厂试制的许多新产品，有力地支援了铁路新线建设。山海关工厂给湘江大桥制造了跨度七十三和七十五公尺的钢梁，给汉水桥和宝成路制造十五吨德立克起重机，给各工程局制造六十五吨新式架桥机；沈阳厂制造的卷扬机，特别是两厂采用苏联先进的“机器样钣法”制造的五十五公尺下承标准钢桁梁和拆装梁，这都是中国桥梁工厂第一次生产的新钢梁和新工具。这些用先进技术制造的钢梁质量空前提高，杆件可以互换，并提高制造钢梁效率百分之六十五，为我国今后制造高质量的定型梁和大量钢结构开辟了道路。
    为了推广苏联先进经验和交流三个工厂的工作经验，铁道部新建铁路工程总局在今年一月曾召开各桥梁工厂厂务会议。会上除总结去年的生产情况外，还布置了今年的生产任务。今年各厂总产值较去年均有提高，计沈阳厂提高百分之二点二，山海关厂提高百分之三点六，丰台厂提高百分之三点二七。
