The reconstructed tool workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant was put into production on February 18th. The tool workshop is part of the plant's overall reconstruction project.

A year ago, the tool workshop was a workshop with outdated equipment and low production capacity, unable to manufacture precision tools and keep up with the demands of production development. After a year of renovation of the plant buildings and installation of high-efficiency new machine tools from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European People's Democracies, the situation in the tool workshop has completely changed. With these modern equipment, the production capacity of the tool workshop to manufacture precision tools has increased more than twofold compared to the past. In addition, lighting, ventilation and heating equipment have been reinstalled, fundamentally improving the working environment. The tool workshop has two floors. Previously, when the machine tools on the upper floor were running, the lower floor would feel the vibration; after the renovation, the machines on the upper floor are as stable as if they were installed on the ground, and no vibration will be felt when they are running, and there are elevators for vertical access.

In the renovation of the tool workshop, Soviet experts provided systematic guidance from the renovation of the plant buildings to the installation of the machines. The reinforcement of the main beams was an extremely arduous task in the renovation project. Thanks to the Soviet expert Bulekov's personal on-site guidance and the proposal of reinforcement methods, the early completion of the renovation project was guaranteed. In order to master the new machines, the workers had previously learned about the knowledge and operating skills of these automatic and semi-automatic machine tools in training classes. Advanced producer Yang Lianye used high-speed cutting as soon as he arrived at the new tool workshop. Veteran worker Yin Shuren said: "The completion of the new workshop encourages us to redouble our efforts to create a happy life." After the female apprentice Shen Lirong came to the new tool workshop, she went to work early every day to clean the machines, and also scrubbed the grinding machine shared by everyone so clean that it would not be stained with oil.

The commissioning of the new tool workshop has strengthened the production capacity of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and will manufacture more and better new machine tools to supply the industrial construction of the motherland.

### 沈阳第一机床厂工具车间改建工程完工

    沈阳第一机床厂工具车间改建工程完工
    沈阳第一机床厂改建后的工具车间于二月十八日投入生产。工具车间是该厂全部改建工程的一部分。
    一年以前，工具车间是一个设备落后，生产能力很低的车间，不能制造精密工具，赶不上生产发展的要求。经过一年来的场房改建，安装了来自苏联和东欧人民民主国家的高效能新式机床，工具车间的情况已经完全改变。有了这些现代化设备，工具车间制造精密工具的生产能力比过去提高两倍以上。此外，并重新安装了照明设备和通风采暖设备，根本改善了作业环境。工具车间楼上楼下两层，以前楼上的机床开动时，下面便感到震动；改建后，楼上的机器也像安装在平地上一样，开动起来再不会感到震动，而且有电梯上下联系。
    在工具车间的改建中，从改建场房到安装机器，苏联专家都作了系统的指导。主梁的加固是改建工程的一项极其艰巨的工作，由于苏联专家布列阔夫亲自在现场指导施工，提出了加固办法，保证了改建工程的提前完工。为了掌握新的机器，工人们事先已由训练班里学到关于这些自动和半自动机床的知识与操作技术。先进生产者杨连业一到新工具车间，便使用了高速切削。老工人殷述仁说：“新车间的落成鼓舞着我们加倍努力，来创造幸福的生活。”女徒工沈丽容来到新工具车间之后，每天都提前上班擦洗机器，并把大家共同使用的砂轮机也刷得干干净净，不使沾上油污。
    新工具车间的投入生产，壮大了第一机床厂的生产能力，将制造出更多更好的新式车床，供应祖国的工业建设。
