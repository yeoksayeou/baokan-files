Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Since Stalin's works were introduced to China thirty years ago, their dissemination has become increasingly widespread and the number of copies printed has continuously increased.

The earliest of Stalin’s works to be introduced to China was “The Foundations of Leninism.” The fourth issue of the “New Youth” quarterly, published in December 1924, contained Jiang Guangchi's translation of "The Principle of the National Question in Leninism" (i.e., Chapter 6, "The National Question," of "The Foundations of Leninism"). The first issue of the "New Youth" monthly, published in April 1925, published Qu Qiubai's abridged translation of "An Outline of Leninism." In early 1926, this outstanding theoretical work was published in Guangzhou as a separate booklet.

During the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, many of Stalin's important works were translated into Chinese and circulated openly or secretly. These included "The Foundations of Leninism," "Questions Concerning Leninism," "Marxism and the National Question," and Stalin's writings on the Chinese revolution. The reports of Stalin at the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th Congresses of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were promptly published in newspapers and periodicals in summary or in complete translation. In January 1934, just as the fifth counter-encirclement campaign was in full swing, the Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party in Ruijin, Jiangxi, published "Problems of Leninism," which included twelve of Stalin's works. During this period, Stalin's works published by the Foreign Workers' Publishing House in the Soviet Union, including various separate booklets and "Problems of Leninism" (1935 edition), were also continuously shipped to our country.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party, in a severe wartime environment, persisted in publishing and distributing Chinese translations of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin by various means. Stalin's works accounted for a large number of these. Stalin's book "Problems of Leninism" had a complete translation. Another collection of Stalin's works, "On the Opposition," was also published in Shanghai in May 1938. The Chinese version of Stalin's great work "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" was published in Yan'an by the Liberation Press in 1939, and then reprinted in Chongqing and Shanghai. At the same time, the Chinese version of the "Short Course of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow, Soviet Union, was also shipped to China in large quantities. The whole Party implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and launched a wave of studying the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Stalin's writings on the Chinese revolution were systematically translated during this period, and compiled by the Liberation Press into the book "Lenin and Stalin on China," which circulated widely throughout the country. In January 1939, Yan'an, under extremely difficult material conditions, published the five-volume "Selected Works of Stalin." This selection was reprinted in Shanghai in 1940, in the combatant Shanxi Liberated Area in 1941, and in the liberated Northeast by the Xinhua Bookstore in 1949 with a new version.

After the victory of the national revolution in 1949, the number of publications and distribution of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin in our country greatly increased. Among them, the publication volume of Stalin's works from 1949 to 1953 exceeded 10 million copies. During this period, Xinhua Bookstore and People's Publishing House successively printed fifty kinds of Stalin's works, with a total of more than 8.6 million copies, and ten kinds of joint works, with a total of 2.48 million copies.

In addition, from 1949 to 1953, the International Bookstore also imported more than 3.89 million copies of the Chinese version of Stalin's works from the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow from the Soviet International Book Company.

Among the Chinese versions of Stalin's works successively printed by Xinhua Bookstore and People's Publishing House from 1949 to 1953, the separate booklet "The Foundations of Leninism" and the combined printing of this book and "Questions Concerning Leninism" were successively printed a total of 300,050 copies, and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" was printed 484,000 copies. Stalin's genius work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics" was printed 259,000 copies, and this work had a huge impact on China's scientific research work. Stalin's brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" is of great significance to our country's socialist construction, with a total of 1,457,000 copies printed. Stalin's "Speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" was printed 787,000 copies.

The Chinese edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin," translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, published its first volume in October 1953, which was a major event in the political life of the Chinese people. The first volume was printed for the first time with 1.04 million copies. The second volume was published in February this year, and the number of copies also exceeded one million. The other volumes of "The Complete Works of Stalin" will be published successively in the next two to three years.

    斯大林的著作在我国大量出版
   【新华社四日讯】斯大林的著作自三十年前介绍到中国来以后，传播越来越广，印数日益增多。
    最早介绍到中国来的斯大林的著作是“论列宁主义基础”。一九二四年十二月出版的“新青年”季刊第四期，刊载了蒋光赤译的“列宁主义之民族问题的原理”（即“论列宁主义基础”第六章“民族问题”）。一九二五年四月出版的“新青年”月刊第一号，发表了瞿秋白摘要译述的“列宁主义概论”一文。一九二六年初，这一杰出的理论著作在广州出版了单行本。
    在第一、第二次国内革命战争时期，斯大林的许多重要著作都已译成中文，公开地或秘密地流行着。其中包括“论列宁主义基础”、“论列宁主义底几个问题”、“马克思主义和民族问题”等书，及斯大林关于中国革命问题的一些著作。斯大林在联共（布）第十四次、第十五次、第十六次、第十七次代表大会上的报告，都及时地在报刊上发表了摘要或出版了全译本。一九三四年一月，正当第五次反围攻战争紧张进行的时候，中共中央局在江西瑞金出版了包括斯大林十二篇著作的“列宁主义问题”。在这时期，苏联外国工人出版社出版的斯大林著作，包括各种单行本和“列宁主义问题”（一九三五年版），也不断地输送到我国来。
    在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党在严重的战争环境中，仍坚持用种种方法出版和发行马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作的中译本。其中斯大林的著作占有很大的数量。斯大林的“列宁主义问题”一书有了完善的译本。斯大林另一文集“论反对派”也在一九三八年五月在上海出版。斯大林的伟大著作“苏联共产党（布）历史简明教程”中文本一九三九年在延安由解放社出版，接着在重庆、上海翻印，同时苏联莫斯科外国文书籍出版局的“联共（布）党史简明教程”中文版也大量地运到了中国。全党执行了毛泽东同志的指示，掀起了学习苏联共产党历史的热潮。斯大林关于中国革命问题的著作，在这时期有了系统的翻译，并由解放社编入“列宁斯大林论中国”一书，大量流传于全国各地。一九三九年一月，延安在极端困难的物质条件下，出版了五卷本“斯大林选集”。这部选集一九四零年在上海，一九四一年在战斗的山西解放区都有翻印，一九四九年又在解放了的东北由新华书店印行了新的版本。
    一九四九年全国革命胜利后，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作在我国出版发行的数量有了很大的增加。其中，斯大林著作从一九四九年到一九五三年的出版量已超过一千万册。在这一时期中，新华书店、人民出版社先后印行了斯大林的著作五十种，印数共达八百六十多万册，合著文集十种，印数达二百四十八万册。
    此外，国际书店自一九四九年到一九五三年，还向苏联国际图书公司进口了莫斯科外国文书籍出版局的斯大林著作中文本三百八十九万多册。
    在新华书店、人民出版社从一九四九年到一九五三年先后印行的斯大林著作中文本当中，“论列宁主义基础”单行本及本书和“论列宁主义底几个问题”的合印本先后共印行了三十万零五千册，“苏联共产党（布）历史简明教程”印行了四十八万四千册。斯大林的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”印行了二十五万九千册，这部著作对于中国的科学研究工作发生了巨大的影响。斯大林的光辉著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”，对我国的社会主义建设事业有极大的意义，共印行了一百四十五万七千册。斯大林“在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说”印行了七十八万七千册。
    中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局翻译的“斯大林全集”在一九五三年十月出版了第一卷，这是我国人民政治生活上的一件大事。第一卷第一次就印行了一百零四万册。今年二月出版了第二卷，印数也超过一百万册。“斯大林全集”其他各卷将在今后两三年内陆续出版。
