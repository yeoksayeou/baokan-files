Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, March 30th: The coal city of Fushun has unveiled the prelude to its "overall transformation." A large number of workers are carrying out the first batch of new construction, expansion, and renovation projects on the surface or underground of the more than thirty-mile-long mining area. After the completion of this batch of projects, Fushun's power coal and coking coal will increase by more than 1.4 million tons compared to last year, and the production of oil shale, the raw material for synthetic petroleum, will increase by more than 1.3 million tons compared to last year.

This year's construction projects in Fushun are just the "outpost" projects of the "overall transformation." Among them are the continued renovation of the new underground mining area of the Laohutai Mine, and the equipping of the Liushan inclined shaft of the Shengli Mine and the West vertical shaft of the Longfeng Mine, which have never produced coal before. This batch of projects will not only quickly increase the production of coal that China urgently needs at present, but will also enable the Fushun Mine to fully launch a large-scale "overall transformation" on the premise of maintaining and maximizing the current production. After the new underground mining area of the Laohutai Mine is put into production (the current mining area of the mine is insufficient, and the output of raw coal last year was only 61% of the equipment capacity), the designed output of the existing equipment can be reached. After the Liushan inclined shaft with an annual output of more than 1 million tons of raw coal is put into production, the East and West shafts of the Shengli Mine inserted in the center of the West Open-pit Mine mining area can be gradually abolished, so that the mining range of coal and oil shale in the West Open-pit Mine can be expanded.

Due to the utilization of existing equipment and various favorable conditions, except for the Liushan inclined shaft and the new mining area of the Laohutai Mine, this year's projects can be completed and put into production this year. If a new batch of mine shafts with the same total production capacity as them are built, it will increase the investment by about four times, and it will take six years to put them into production.

### 煤都抚顺揭开“总体改造”的序幕

    煤都抚顺揭开“总体改造”的序幕
   【新华社抚顺三十日电】煤都抚顺已经揭开了“总体改造”的序幕。大批职工正在三十多里长的矿区的地面或井下，进行第一批新建、扩建和改建工程。这批工程完工后，抚顺的动力用煤、炼焦煤将比去年增加一百四十多万吨，人造石油的原料——油母页岩的产量将比去年增加一百三十多万吨。
    抚顺今年的建设工程，只是“总体改造”的“前哨”工程。其中有继续改建老虎台矿的井下新采煤区，装备从来没有出过煤的胜利矿的刘山斜井和龙凤矿的西竖井。这批工程不但可以很快地增产我国目前急需的煤，并将使抚顺矿在保持和尽量提高目前产量的前提下，全面展开规模巨大的“总体改造”。老虎台矿的井下新采煤区投入生产后（该矿目前采煤区不够，去年原煤产量只有设备能力百分之六十一），现有设备的设计产量就可以达到。年产一百多万吨原煤的刘山斜井投入生产后，就可以逐步废除插在西露天矿采煤区中央的胜利矿东井和西井，使得西露天矿煤和油母页岩的开采范围扩大。
    由于利用现有设备和各种有利条件，本年工程除刘山斜井和老虎台矿的新采煤区外，都可在今年完工投入生产。如果新建一批总生产能力和它们相同的矿井，那就要增加四倍左右的投资，而且还要在六年以后才能投入生产。
