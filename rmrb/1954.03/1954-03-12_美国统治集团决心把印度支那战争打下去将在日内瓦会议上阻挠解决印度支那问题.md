Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: World peace-loving people all hope that the Geneva Conference can achieve success in easing tensions in Asia and the world. However, according to a United Press correspondent in London on the 10th, when reporting on the "consultations" among the United States, Britain, and France regarding the Geneva Conference, it was revealed that "the United States is still not prepared to compromise on the unification of Korea or the settlement of the Indochina issue." What the United States is "prepared" for is the "failure" of the Geneva Conference, thus allowing the Indochina war to continue. The "Wall Street Journal," a mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, recently published a report by its Washington correspondent, Cromley, stating that the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon have definitively concluded that the Geneva Conference is bound to fail, and the Indochina war is bound to continue.

In order to keep the Indochina war going, the United States is conspiring to reuse the "United Nations" banner and expand the Indochina war into a second war of aggression against Korea, based on the policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." According to "Wall Street Journal" reporter Cromley, the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon are "basing on some long-term assumptions," such as: the Indochina issue will not be resolved at the Geneva Conference, the Indochina war will continue, etc., to formulate a "new plan" to gradually transform the Indochina war into a "United Nations war" like the Korean War, with the "Asian member states" of the United Nations providing troops, and the United States supplying weapons and supplies. The United States also wants to train and expand the Indochina puppet army, equipping them with heavy weapons, just like in South Korea. According to United Press, Dulles is expected to strongly urge the French government at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris in April to consider the "benefits" of allowing the United States to send training groups to Indochina. United Press pointed out that the suggestion of sending American training groups "is receiving increasing support from government officials." Eisenhower also believes that doing so would be "beneficial" to France.

The United States' single-minded policy of keeping the Indochina war going has been openly stated by U.S. Vice President Nixon. In a speech in Philadelphia on the 9th, he openly regarded Indochina and Asia as American territory, saying, "Losing Indochina could mean losing Asia." Therefore, the United States must step up its intervention in the Indochina war. Nixon said that the United States is now rearranging its armed forces and revising military plans "to implement this policy." He revealed that this "shift" in U.S. strategy is the result of joint efforts by the National Security Council, supported by Eisenhower, and Secretary of Defense Wilson, Undersecretary Anderson, Secretary of the Army Stevens, and Secretary of the Air Force Talbott. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford also confirmed in a speech in New York on the 9th that the United States intends to continue to accelerate military "aid" to Indochina.

Why is the United States so afraid of the Indochina war stopping and so deliberately trying to keep it going? Since the failure of its adventure in Korea, the U.S. ruling clique has attempted to use the world's only largest "hot war," the Indochina war, to maintain and deepen international tensions and seek maximum war profits. U.S. President Eisenhower once bluntly stated that after the end of the Korean War, Indochina has become the "center" for the United States to pursue its Asian aggression policy. If Indochina is "lost," the United States will not be able to obtain tin and tungsten from there, and it will also affect the United States' access to strategic materials from the resources of Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Early on, when the United States began to pay attention to Indochina, the "Wall Street Journal" greedily believed that Indochina's abundant resources were an object that the United States was "worth betting big" on. And due to years of continuous "aid" to France, the United States has continuously squeezed French capital out of Indochina, and Indochina's strategic materials have gradually become the property of American monopoly capital. The American "New York Herald Tribune" once nakedly stated, "From the very profound meaning of American interests, this war is precisely our war."

### 美国统治集团决心把印度支那战争打下去将在日内瓦会议上阻挠解决印度支那问题

    美国统治集团决心把印度支那战争打下去将在日内瓦会议上阻挠解决印度支那问题
    【新华社十一日讯】　世界爱好和平的人民都希望日内瓦会议能够在缓和亚洲和世界紧张局势方面取得成就。但是，据合众社驻伦敦记者十日报道美英法三国正就日内瓦会议进行“协商”时透露，“美国至今还没有准备在朝鲜统一或印度支那问题的解决上妥协”。美国所“准备”的是日内瓦会议的“失败”，从而使印度支那战争继续下去。美国垄断资本喉舌“华尔街日报”最近刊载驻华盛顿记者克罗姆莱的报道说，美国国务院和五角大楼已经肯定地认为日内瓦会议一定失败，而印度支那战争一定会打下去。
    为了使印度支那战争打下去，美国正阴谋根据“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，再度盗用“联合国”旗帜，把印度支那战争扩大成为第二个侵略朝鲜战争。据“华尔街日报”记者克罗姆莱透露，美国国务院和五角大楼正在“基于一些长远的假设”，诸如：使印度支那问题在日内瓦会议上得不到解决，继续印度支那战争等等，来拟订一个“新计划”，想逐渐把印度支那战争变为像朝鲜战争一样的“联合国战争”，由联合国中的“亚洲成员国”提供军队，由美国供给武器和供应品。美国还要像在南朝鲜一样，训练并扩大印度支那伪军，用重武器装备他们。据合众社透露，预料杜勒斯在四月间巴黎北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上将力请法国政府考虑让美国派训练团到印度支那去的“好处”。合众社指出，派遣美国训练团的建议“已得到政府人士愈来愈大的支持”。艾森豪威尔也认为这样做会对法国有“好处”。
    美国的一心要使印度支那战争打下去的政策，已由美国副总统尼克松公开表明。他九日在费城讲话，公然把印度支那和亚洲当成是美国的领土，他说：“丢掉印度支那就可能会丢掉亚洲”，因此，美国必须加紧干涉印度支那战争。尼克松说，美国现在正在重新布置美国的武装力量和修正军事计划，“以执行这种政策”。他透露，美国战略的这种“转变”，是由艾森豪威尔支持的国家安全委员会与国防部长威尔逊和副部长安德逊、陆军部长斯蒂文斯、空军部长泰尔波特等人共同努力的结果。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福九日在纽约发表演说时也证实，美国打算继续加速对印度支那进行军事“援助”。
    为什么美国这样害怕印度支那战争停下来，并且处心积虑地要使这个战争继续下去呢？自从在朝鲜的冒险失败以后，美国统治集团就企图利用世界上唯一最大的“热战”印度支那战争，以达到保持和加深国际紧张局势，谋取最大战争利润的目的。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾经露骨说过，在朝鲜战争结束后，印度支那已变为美国推行亚洲侵略政策的“中心”。如果印度支那“完了”，美国就得不到那里的锡和钨，也会影响美国从印度尼西亚和东南亚的富源中取得战略物资。早在美国开始注意印度支那时，“华尔街日报”就曾贪婪地认为，印度支那的丰富资源是美国“值得大赌”的对象。而由于几年来不断对法国的“援助”，美国已经不断地把法国资本挤出印度支那，印度支那的战略物资也已逐渐成为美国垄断资本的囊中物。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”曾赤裸裸地说，“从美国利益这一极深刻的意义来说，这个战争正是我们的战争。”
