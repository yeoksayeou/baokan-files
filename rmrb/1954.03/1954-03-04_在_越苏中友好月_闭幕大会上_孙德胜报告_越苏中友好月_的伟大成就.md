Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. According to Vietnam News Agency: Sun Duc Thang, Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet China Friendship Month, delivered a report on the achievements of the Friendship Month at the closing ceremony of the Vietnam-Soviet China Friendship Month on February 21st.

    Sun Duc Thang first summarized the enthusiastic celebrations of the Friendship Month by the people throughout Vietnam. He said that the opening ceremony of the Vietnam-Soviet China Friendship Month was solemnly held in a certain place in North Vietnam on January 18th. On the same day and in the days that followed, solemn opening ceremonies of the Friendship Month were held in Northwest Vietnam, the Viet Bac Interzone, the Third Interzone, and the left bank of the Red River (all of which are in North Vietnam), the Fourth and Fifth Interzones of Central Vietnam, and South Vietnam. From North to South Vietnam, in the liberated areas and in enemy-occupied areas such as the left bank of the Red River, the broad masses of the people held Friendship Month activities. In the opening ceremony of the Third Interzone in North Vietnam alone, more than 40,000 people participated; in the mountainous Quang Yen province, which is mostly controlled by the enemy, more than 100,000 people participated in mass rallies and other forms of activities in the first half of the Friendship Month. People of all strata with different beliefs and occupations enthusiastically celebrated the Friendship Month. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam also participated in the Friendship Month activities, deepening the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the overseas Chinese.

    Sun Duc Thang continued, during this period, the Friendship Month organizing committees at all levels published 50 kinds of pamphlets introducing the situation in the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, as well as the friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of fraternal countries, totaling 186,390 copies, which have been widely circulated among the masses; in addition, many Friendship badges, national flags of fraternal countries, and portraits of leaders were printed. The postal and telecommunications departments of the Vietnamese government issued approximately three million Friendship stamps. The "Voice of Vietnam" radio station and South Vietnam radio station broadcast daily introductions to the people of fraternal countries or news of celebrations of the Friendship Month at home and abroad. All newspapers and periodicals published special issues celebrating the Friendship Month. According to incomplete statistics, during the Friendship Month, 525,000 people listened to reports by Vietnamese representatives who had visited fraternal countries; 3,910,000 people visited photo exhibitions; and nearly 2,400,000 people watched specially screened films from fraternal countries. In addition, songs, poems, dances, boat races, bicycle races, torchlight processions, and bonfire parties were held in various places. The people in the enemy-occupied areas also went to the liberated areas to participate in various activities despite the enemy's obstruction. For example, more than 2,000 people from the French-controlled areas of the Third Interzone went to the liberated areas to visit exhibitions, and some had to pass through French outposts and walk for six or seven days to reach their destination.

    Sun Duc Thang emphasized that the Friendship Month effectively educated the broad masses of the people, aroused their patriotic enthusiasm, and increased their confidence in the final victory of the war of resistance and the glorious future. Inspired by the spirit of self-sacrifice of the soldiers of the Soviet, Chinese, and Korean People's Armies, the soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army launched movements to annihilate the enemy. A platoon of the Vietnam People's Army near Dien Bien Phu, learning from the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Battle of Shangganling in Korea, repelled seven attacks by an enemy battalion on January 31, killing 70 enemy soldiers and receiving commendations from the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army. Workers and farmers in Vietnam learned from the example of the working people of fraternal countries and successively launched production increase campaigns and achieved results. For example, the workers of the Hoang Van paper mill increased production by 13.6 percent and reduced costs by 10 percent in the first two weeks of the Friendship Month. The workers of a certain military pharmaceutical factory in the Viet Bac Interzone increased production by more than 200 percent during the Friendship Month. Vietnamese farmers also launched competitions to increase production and protect crops. After hearing about the selfless labor of Chinese farmers in the Huai River harnessing project, 6,000 farmers in Nam Dinh province actively participated in consolidating dikes and storing water, completing their tasks three days ahead of schedule; farmers in the liberated areas of Ninh Binh province built 56 kilometers of roads, dug more than 200 wells, reclaimed more than 300 hectares of rice fields, and caught more than 200 kilograms of pests in a short-term competition celebrating the Friendship Month.

    Sun Duc Thang said that through the various activities of the Friendship Month, the Vietnamese people clearly saw the great struggles, national construction, happy lives, and great strength of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. This strengthened the determination of the Vietnamese people to advance along the path taken by the fraternal countries, because the Vietnamese people knew that this was the only path for Vietnam to achieve a glorious future and become an independent and prosperous country. Through the Friendship Month, the Vietnamese people further recognized the consistent peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and increased their confidence in the final victory of the world peace and democracy camp and the peace movement. At the same time, the Friendship Month also helped the Vietnamese people to clearly recognize the close relationship between Vietnam and fraternal countries, the profound influence of the revolutions in the Soviet Union and China on the Vietnamese revolution, and the value of the friendship between Vietnam and fraternal countries in the war of resistance and national construction. Therefore, the friendly ties between the Vietnamese people and fraternal countries, especially the people of the Soviet Union and China, have become even closer.

    Finally, in his report, Sun Duc Thang, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries for their full support of the Vietnam-Soviet China Friendship Month; at the same time, he assured the people of the fraternal countries that the Vietnamese people would do their utmost to continue to strengthen the unbreakable friendship between themselves and the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries in order to repay the sympathy and support of the people of the fraternal countries for the Vietnamese people.

    在“越苏中友好月”闭幕大会上
    孙德胜报告“越苏中友好月”的伟大成就
    【新华社二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越苏中友好月中央组织委员会主席孙德胜，二月二十一日在越苏中友好月闭幕大会上作了关于友好月取得成就的报告。
    孙德胜首先综述了越南全国人民热烈庆祝友好月的情况。他说，一月十八日在北越某地隆重举行了越苏中友好月开幕典礼。在同一天和后几天，越南西北部、越北联区、第三联区和红河左岸地区（以上均属北越），中越的第四和第五联区以及南越都隆重举行了友好月的开幕典礼。从北越到南越，在解放区以及在红河左岸地区这样的敌占区，广大人民都举行了友好月活动。仅在北越第三联区的开幕典礼就有四万多人参加；在大部为敌人控制下多山的广安省，在友好月的前半月中就有十万多人参加了群众集会和其他形式的活动。不同信仰和不同职业的各阶层人民都热烈庆祝友好月。旅居越南的数十万华侨也参加了友好月活动，加深了越南人民和华侨之间的友谊。
    孙德胜接着说，在这个期间，友好月的各级组织委员会出版的介绍苏联、中国和各人民民主国家情况以及越南人民和各兄弟国家人民之间友谊的小册子有五十种，共十八万六千三百九十册，已在群众中广泛流传；此外还印行许多友好徽章、兄弟国家的国旗和领袖肖像。越南政府邮电部门发行了约三百万张友好邮票。“越南之声”电台和南越电台每天广播关于兄弟国家人民的介绍或国内外庆祝友好月的消息。所有的报纸、期刊都出版了庆祝友好月的专号。据不完全的统计，在友好月期间，已有五十二万五千人听取访问过兄弟国家的越南代表们所作的见闻传达报告；三百九十一万人参观了图片展览会；将近二百四十万人观看了专门放映的各兄弟国家的影片。此外，各地还举行了歌咏、诗歌、舞蹈、划船和自行车比赛，火炬游行以及营火会等活动。敌占区的人民也不顾敌人的阻挠到解放区参加各种活动。如第三联区就有两千多人从法军控制区到解放区参观展览会，有些人必须通过法军的据点并步行六、七天才能到达目的地。
    孙德胜着重指出，友好月实际地教育了广大人民群众，激起了他们的爱国热情，提高了他们对抗战最后胜利和辉煌前途的信心。越南人民军战士在苏联、中国和朝鲜人民军队自我牺牲精神鼓舞下展开了歼敌运动。在奠边府近郊的越南人民军的一个排，学习了中国人民志愿军在朝鲜上甘岭战役中的英勇作战精神，在一月三十一日击退了敌军一个营的七次攻击，毙敌七十名，得到越南人民军总司令部的奖励。越南的工人和农民学习各兄弟国家劳动人民的榜样，接连展开增产竞赛并取得了成绩。如黄文造纸厂的工人在友好月的前两个星期中提高了产量百分之十三点六，降低成本百分之十。越北联区某军用药品工厂的工人在友好月中将产量提高到百分之二百以上。越南农民也展开了增加产量、保护作物的竞赛。南定省的六千个农民在听了关于中国农民在治淮工程中的忘我劳动事迹后，积极参加巩固堤坝和蓄水的工作，并提前三天完成任务；宁平省解放区的农民在庆祝友好月的短期竞赛中修筑了长达五十六公里的公路，挖了二百多口井，开垦了三百多公顷的稻田和捕捉了二百多公斤的害虫。
    孙德胜说，通过友好月的各项活动，越南人民清楚地看到苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家的伟大斗争、国家建设、幸福的生活以及巨大的力量。这就加强了越南人民要沿着兄弟国家所走的道路前进的决心，因为越南人民知道这是越南走向辉煌前途和成为一个独立、繁荣的国家的唯一道路。通过友好月，越南人民更加认识到苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家的一贯的爱好和平的政策，并对世界和平民主阵营以及和平运动的最后胜利增加了信心。同时，友好月也帮助了越南人民清楚地认识到越南与兄弟国家之间的密切关系，苏联与中国的革命对于越南革命的深刻影响，以及越南与兄弟国家在抗战与国家建设中的友谊的价值。因此，越南人民与兄弟国家，尤其是与苏联和中国人民之间的友好联系已更加紧密起来了。
    孙德胜最后在报告中代表越南人民对于全力支持越苏中友好月的苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的人民表示衷心的感谢；同时，向各兄弟国家人民提出保证：越南人民将尽全部力量来继续加强和苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，以答谢各兄弟国家人民对越南人民的同情和支持。
