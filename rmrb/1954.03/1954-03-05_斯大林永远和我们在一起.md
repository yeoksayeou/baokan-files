    Stalin Will Always Be With Us
    Li Feng'en, Model Worker of Special-Class Industry, Anshan

    Comrade Stalin! For so many years, ever since I knew your great name, I have respected and loved you like a beloved father. Your name is the strength of the working people, your name is the banner of human victory. I often ask myself, how could I, Li Feng'en, an ironworker who suffered in the old society, suddenly become the master of society? How could I have such a life today? And I answered myself: because there is the Chinese Communist Party, there is the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, there is Comrade Stalin's concern for the Chinese revolution, and there is Comrade Stalin's help to the Chinese people.

    I will never forget that in August 1945, you personally sent the Soviet Red Army to liberate the Northeast together with the Chinese People's Army. Right here in Anshan, I was liberated from a life of servitude, and the hope of generations came true.

    Comrade Stalin! From March of last year to March of this year, our country has made leaping progress. We won the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. We completed the first year's national construction tasks of the first five-year plan. In this year, our industry has achieved unprecedented development, the first iron and steel industrial base of New China has become stronger, we have automated machines, new devices, and new equipment. Two automated blast furnaces have already produced large quantities of iron, and large rolling mills and seamless steel tube plants have produced new products needed for industrial construction in large quantities. Our labor is less strenuous than before, and labor productivity has also greatly improved. Comrade Stalin! Every Chinese person knows that these achievements are due to the great assistance of you and the Soviet people you have educated. Whenever we see those latest technological equipment, we will think of you and work even harder to produce. Last year, when the first automated blast furnace in New China was about to start production, we heard the news of your death, and we were deeply saddened. However, we remembered how you commemorated Comrade Lenin, and it was as if we heard your solemn oath when Comrade Lenin passed away. We wiped away our tears and resolutely lit the fire according to the plan and smoothly produced the first batch of molten iron. Comrade Stalin! You have not left us, you will always live in our hearts. When I am working, I am always thinking: Comrade Stalin is right beside us, watching us with concern!

    We firmly remember your words, you said: "Steel is the foundation of industrialization." Now, we are working hard to strive for more steel, to strive for the country's socialist industrialization. You also said: "It is necessary to cultivate red technicians and red experts from the working class." Comrade Stalin! We have done as you said. I was originally an ordinary worker, an illiterate. After liberation, under the cultivation of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, I learned culture and technology. Just as you said, the Party trained me like a gardener cultivating his favorite flowers. What would have taken more than ten years to learn in the old society, I learned in two years. Being promoted from an ordinary worker to a technician, many old workers think this is strange. I said: "Under the cultivation of Chairman Mao, this is not a strange thing, this is the road of Stalin."

    In December 1952, I attended the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna. When I returned, I spent New Year's Day in Moscow in 1953. At that time, I felt so happy that I could actually come to the place where Comrade Stalin worked. I visited the Kremlin and paid homage to Lenin's Mausoleum; I also visited famous factories in Moscow, where I saw the great cause that you and the Soviet people had created for human history. I saw the peaceful and happy life of the Soviet people. I also realized more deeply how you and the Soviet people care about China's construction and the lives of the Chinese people. When I visited the Kaganovich Ball Bearing Factory, the workers told us that their production not only guaranteed the supply for the Soviet Union's needs, but also guaranteed the supply for China's needs. They also said that every Soviet worker is like this. Comrade Stalin! What can we say! Where in the world can we find such great selfless friendship?

    Chairman Mao told us that to commemorate Comrade Stalin, we must infinitely strengthen the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and more closely study Stalin's theories, Stalin's working methods, and Stalin's thinking methods. We have done this, we are doing this now, and we will continue to do this in the future. I am a Communist Party member working on a blast furnace, and I must work even harder to learn advanced Soviet science and technology, and produce more and better high-quality iron. We must do a good job in construction work, and we must lay a good foundation. Producing one more ton of iron will accelerate the pace of our country's socialist industrialization and increase the strength to defend world peace. Comrade Stalin! Under the shining light of your great thoughts, and under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will always be victorious in every battle! Always be victorious in every battle.

### 斯大林永远和我们在一起

    斯大林永远和我们在一起
    鞍山特等工业劳动模范　李凤恩
    斯大林同志！这么多年，从我知道你的伟大的名字的时候起，我就一直像敬爱父亲一样的敬爱着你。你的名字，就是劳动人民的力量，你的名字，就是人类胜利的旗帜。我常常问我自己，我，李凤恩，一个在旧社会受苦受难的炼铁工人，怎么会一下子变成了社会的主人？怎么会有今天这样的生活？我自己又回答了我自己，那是因为有了中国共产党，有了中国人民伟大领袖毛主席，有了斯大林同志对中国革命的关怀，有了斯大林同志对中国人民的帮助。
    我永远不会忘记，一九四五年八月，你亲自派来了苏联红军和中国人民军队一起解放了东北。就在鞍山这个地方，我被从牛马生活里解放出来，多少代多少年来的希望实现了。
    斯大林同志！从去年三月到今年三月，这一年，我们的国家有了飞跃的进步。我们赢得了抗美援朝的伟大胜利。我们完成了第一个五年计划第一年度国家建设的任务。这一年，我们的工业有了空前的发展，新中国的第一个钢铁工业基地强大起来了，我们有了自动化机器，有了新的装置和新的设备。两座自动化的炼铁炉已经炼出了大批的铁，大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂已经大量生产出工业建设上所需要的新产品。我们的劳动比以前省劲了，劳动生产率也大大提高了。斯大林同志！每一个中国人民都知道，这些成就是在你和你教养下的苏联人民大力帮助下得来的。当我们一看到那些最新的技术装备，我们就会想起你，就会更加劲地生产。去年，在新中国第一座自动化炼铁炉将要开始生产的时候，我们听到了你逝世的消息，我们悲痛万分。可是，我们想起了当年你是怎样纪念列宁同志的，想到这里，就好像听到了你在列宁同志逝世的时候庄严宣誓的声音。我们擦干了眼泪，坚决地按照计划点着了火，顺利地出了第一炉铁水。斯大林同志！你没有离开我们，你永远活在我们的心里。当我工作的时候，我总是在想：斯大林同志就在我们的身旁，正在关切地看着我们呢！
    我们牢牢的记住你的话，你说：“钢铁是工业化的基础。”现在，我们正在为争取更多的钢铁，为争取国家社会主义工业化而努力。你又说：“要从工人阶级中间培养起红色技师和红色专门家。”斯大林同志！我们照着你的话办了。我原是一个普通工人，一个文盲，解放以后，在毛主席，在中国共产党的培养下，学习了文化，学习了技术。正像你所说的那样，像园丁培养他所爱好的花草一样，党把我训练出来了。旧社会需要十几年才能学到的东西，我学习了两年，便学会了。由一个普通工人提升为技术员，很多老年工人都认为这是奇怪的事，我说：“在毛主席教养下，这不是奇怪的事，这是斯大林的道路。”
    一九五二年十二月，我出席在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会，回来的时候，在莫斯科过的一九五三年元旦，那时候，我感到我自己是多么幸福，我居然能够来到斯大林同志工作的地方。我参观了克里姆林宫，瞻仰了列宁墓；也参观了莫斯科有名的工厂，在那里，我看见了你和苏联人民给人类历史创造下的伟大的事业。我看见了苏联人民和平幸福的生活。我也更体会到你和苏联人民是怎样关怀着中国的建设，怎样关怀着中国人民的生活。在我参观卡冈诺维奇滚珠工厂的时候，工人们告诉我们，他们的生产不但保证供应苏联的需要，而且要保证供应中国的需要。他们又说，每一个苏联工人都是这样。斯大林同志！我们该怎么说呢！世界上那里能找到这种伟大的无私的友谊呢？
    毛主席告诉我们，纪念斯大林同志，我们要无限地加强中苏两国人民的友谊，更加紧学习斯大林的学说，学习斯大林的工作方法和思想方法。我们这样做了，现在这样做，将来还要这样做。我是一个在炼铁炉上工作的共产党员，我更要加倍的努力学习苏联先进科学技术，要炼出更多更好的优质铁。我们要把建设工作做好，就要把基础打好。多炼出一吨铁，就会加快我们国家的社会主义工业化的速度，就会增加保卫世界和平的力量。斯大林同志！在你伟大的思想光辉照耀下，在毛主席英明的领导下，我们永远是百战百胜！永远是百战百胜。
