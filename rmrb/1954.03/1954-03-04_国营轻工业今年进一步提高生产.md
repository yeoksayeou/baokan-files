Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd:

    In contrast to the widespread reduction of civilian production and the increasing impoverishment of people's lives in capitalist countries, this year China's state-owned light industry production will further increase along with the development of the entire national economy.
    According to the preliminary plan, the total output value of state-owned light industry (including central joint state-private enterprises) will increase by 24% this year compared to last year. The planned output of 39 major products will be increased compared to last year. Among them, the production of consumer goods directly related to people's lives will increase by 32.52% compared to last year.
    When compiling this year's production plan, the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government specifically analyzed the increase in people's needs for various products, and studied the possible conditions for increasing the production of various products, and then determined the growth ratio of each product. Because of the large demand for medicines, the state has newly added manufacturing equipment this year, so the increase ratio is the highest. Its total output value will increase by 80% compared to last year. Among them, the production of penicillin, the most widely used special medicine, will increase by 2.3 times, sulfa drugs will increase by 1.6 times, and the total output of various physical therapy equipment will increase by more than 50% compared to last year. In the food industry, the production of vegetable oil will increase by 58% because the number of oil materials supplied to state-owned oil factories by cooperatives this year has increased. The production of sugar has newly added state-owned sugar factories, and the equipment capacity has been expanded, but the supply of sugarcane is slightly insufficient, so it is planned to increase production by 23% this year. According to the same principle, this year the production of cigarettes will increase by 20%, wine will increase by more than 26%, salt will increase by 72%, soap in daily necessities will increase by 73.53%, and rubber shoes will increase by 36%.
    When compiling the production plan for state-owned enterprises, the Central Ministry of Light Industry also considered the coordinated production of local state-owned and private light industrial enterprises across the country. Therefore, the planning of light industrial production across the country will be strengthened this year compared to last year. It is estimated that most products can basically achieve a balance between production and sales. For example, major daily necessities such as salt, cigarettes, beer, and paper for cultural use can basically meet the needs of the people. This year, a considerable portion of pharmaceutical products, which have a weak foundation in China's light industry and have always relied on imports, can also achieve self-sufficiency.
    However, some products cannot be produced in large quantities due to difficulties in the supply of raw materials. The state will take measures to use substitute raw materials and increase the production of substitute products to solve the supply and demand contradiction of these products. For example, the supply of milk and milk powder is currently insufficient. In order to eliminate the worries of mothers, it has been decided to produce more nutritious milk substitutes. The raw material for milk substitutes—soybeans—can be fully supplied domestically, and there is excellent powder-making equipment in Shanghai. Therefore, it is planned to produce 700,000 kilograms of milk substitutes this year, an increase of 2.35 times compared to last year. For example, in order to save food for the country, the brewing industry will use more sweet potatoes, potatoes, and cassava (wild plants in Guangxi) instead of food to brew wine this year. In addition, it will also increase the production of beer, which is beneficial to people's health and has a source of raw materials. The Beijing Brewery, which supplies the needs of the people in the capital, will increase production by 1.3 times this year.
    In order to cooperate with the country's economic construction, the production of means of production in the state-owned light industry system will also have a significant increase this year, the main ones being tires and paper for industrial and commercial use. This year, the output of automobile tires will increase by 50%, which can basically adapt to the development of the national road transportation industry. This year, because a large amount of oil from the Northwest will be transported to the East, and cities will also develop urban transportation, state-owned rubber factories will try to manufacture large tires for large trucks and buses for transporting oil this year. Due to the limitations of raw materials and equipment, the total output of state-owned paper industry will not increase much this year, but in order to support the country's economic construction, the use of paper for industrial and commercial use will increase a lot this year. Among them, the production of cardboard will increase by 69%, the production of roofing felt base paper for construction will increase by 1.1 times, and the production of tough hemp cardboard will increase by 3,400 tons, which can be made into 2.28 million large boxes for packaging to replace wooden boxes, which will save a lot of wood for the country.
    The growth of state-owned light industrial production is based on existing enterprises. Of the total output value increased this year, approximately 77% will rely on existing enterprises to unleash the potential of their equipment. This figure is equivalent to the annual output value of 14 new sugar factories with an annual output of 20,000 tons of sugar. To this end, the Central Ministry of Light Industry is paying attention to adopting technical and organizational measures and balancing equipment that require small investments, have large returns, and can promptly increase production, and requires all factories to strengthen planning management and technical management, save the use of raw materials, and further improve the quantity and quality of products so that they can successfully complete this year's production plan.

### 国营轻工业今年进一步提高生产

    国营轻工业今年进一步提高生产
    【新华社二日讯】和资本主义国家中的民用生产普遍缩减、人民生活日益贫困的情形相反，今年我国国营轻工业的生产将随着整个国民经济的发展而进一步增长。
    根据初步确定的计划，今年国营轻工业（包括中央公私合营企业）的生产总值，将比去年增长百分之二十四；三十九种主要产品的计划产量都比去年提高，其中和人民生活有直接关系的消费品的生产，比去年提高百分之三十二点五二。
    中央人民政府轻工业部在编制今年的生产计划时，曾具体分析了人民对于各种产品的需要的增长情况，同时研究了各种产品增产的可能条件，然后确定每种产品的增长比例。医药用品因为需要量大，国家在今年又新增加了制造设备，因此增加的比例最高。它的总产值将比去年提高百分之八十，其中需用最广的特效药品青霉素（盘尼西林）增产二点三倍，磺胺增产一点六倍，各种物理诊疗器械的总产量比去年增加百分之五十以上。食品工业中，植物油的生产，因为今年合作社供应给国营油脂厂的油料数量增多，因此可以增产百分之五十八。糖的生产新增加了国营糖厂，设备能力扩大，但甘蔗的供应稍有不足，所以今年计划增产百分之二十三。根据同样的原则，今年卷烟增产百分之二十，酒增产百分之二十六以上，盐增产百分之七十二，日用品中的肥皂增产百分之七十三点五三，胶鞋增产百分之三十六。
    中央轻工业部在编制国营企业的生产计划时，同时也考虑到了全国地方国营和私营轻工业企业配合生产的问题。因此今年全国轻工业生产的计划性将比去年加强，估计大部分的产品基本上能做到产销平衡。例如食盐、卷烟、啤酒、文化用纸等主要日用品基本上都能满足人民的需要。我国轻工业中基础薄弱、一向依赖进口的医药用品，今年也有相当大的一部分能够做到自给。
    但是还有一些产品因原料供应困难，不能大量生产，国家将采取使用代用原料和增产代用品的办法来解决这些产品的供需矛盾。例如目前牛奶和奶粉供应不足，为了消除母亲们的忧虑，决定多生产富有营养价值的代乳粉，代乳粉的原料——大豆国内能充分供应，在上海又有优良的制粉设备，因此今年计划生产代乳粉七十万公斤，比去年增加二点三五倍。又如酿酒工业为了替国家节约粮食，今年将多用白薯、马铃薯、木薯（广西的野生植物）等代替粮食来酿酒，另外，又将增产对人民健康有益而原料又有来源的啤酒。供应首都人民需要的北京啤酒厂今年就将增产一点三倍。
    为配合国家的经济建设，今年国营轻工业系统的生产资料的生产也将有显著增长，其中主要的是轮胎和工商业用的纸张。今年汽车轮胎的产量将提高百分之五十，基本上可以适应全国公路运输事业的发展。今年因为西北的石油要大量东运，各城市也要发展市内交通，所以国营橡胶厂今年将试制装运石油的大卡车和公共汽车的大型轮胎。国营造纸工业今年因受原料和设备的限制，总产量增加不多，但为了支援国家的经济建设，今年工商业用纸却增加很多，其中纸板增产百分之六十九，供建筑用的油毡原纸增加一点一倍，坚韧的麻板纸将增产三千四百吨，可以做成二百二十八万多个包装用的大箱子来代替木箱，这样就能为国家节省大量的木材。
    国营轻工业生产的增长是以现有企业为基础的。今年增加的总产值中，约有百分之七十七要依靠现有企业发挥设备的潜在能力来获得。这个数字等于新投入十四个年产砂糖两万吨的糖厂一年的生产总值。为此，中央轻工业部正注意采取那些投资小、收效大、能及时提高生产的技术组织措施和平衡设备的办法，并要求各厂加强计划管理和技术管理，节约使用原材料，进一步提高产品的数量和质量，以便能胜利地完成今年的生产计划。
