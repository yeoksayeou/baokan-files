Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—National state-owned coal mines have begun to reverse the trend of slack production at the beginning of the year and tight production at the end, overfulfilling the state coal production plan for February by 6.59 percent.

This month, the state-owned coal mines in all major regions completed their plans well. Among them, the North China region overfulfilled by 7.14 percent, the Northeast region overfulfilled by 5.24 percent, the East China region overfulfilled by 10.56 percent, the Central South region overfulfilled by 2.46 percent, the Southwest region overfulfilled by 41.6 percent, and the Northwest region overfulfilled by 16.39 percent.

The attendance of employees at state-owned coal mines before and after the Spring Festival, as well as the electrical and mechanical maintenance work and coal loading work during the Spring Festival, have greatly improved compared with previous years. This played a decisive role in reversing the situation in which the February plan was often not completed in previous years. This year, after the employees of state-owned coal mines received publicity and education on the general line, they generally recognized the importance of ensuring attendance to complete the plan for the country's industrialization, and thus widely launched attendance competitions. Many workers also included ensuring attendance as part of the team's work plan, breaking the past practice of absenteeism during the Spring Festival. Many coal mines quickly achieved normal attendance and returned to normal production after the Spring Festival. The attendance rate after the Spring Festival at the Tiechangzi Mine of the Tonghua Mining Bureau reached 99.9 percent, Yingcheng Mine reached 95.5 percent, and Zibo Mining Bureau reached 94.7 percent. Before the Spring Festival this year, all mines made maintenance plans in advance, assigned specific personnel to be responsible for each project, and concentrated the main force on fixed equipment such as hoists, main fans, air compressors, boilers, electrical equipment, and coal washing equipment, which could not be shut down for maintenance at normal times. Because the preparation work was sufficient and leaders at all levels conducted in-depth inspections, the number of equipment units repaired and the number of people participating in maintenance this year were unprecedented, and the construction period and quality were basically guaranteed.

In order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of coal for industrial use, all mines paid special attention to coal loading during the Spring Festival. The North China Coal Mine Administration learned about the coal inventory of each mine in advance before the Spring Festival and sent personnel to the site to supervise the loading. In order to ensure the supply of coking coal to Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Fengfeng Coal Mine did not stop production during the Spring Festival. Kailuan Coal Mine also changed the situation in previous years and overfulfilled the Spring Festival loading task. Fuxin Coal Mine in Northeast China also established a temporary loading committee with railways and other relevant parties to ensure loading. Through these efforts, the national state-owned coal mines completed 99.7 percent of the February loading plan, ensuring the supply of coking coal and power coal, and ensuring the planned transportation of the railway.

    国营煤矿完成二月份产煤计划
    【新华社三日讯】全国国营煤矿已开始扭转历年来生产前松后紧的局面，二月份继续超额百分之六点五九完成了国家产煤计划。
    这一个月，各大区国营煤矿完成计划情况都很好，其中华北区超额百分之七点一四，东北区超额百分之五点二四，华东区超额百分之十点五六，中南区超额百分之二点四六，西南区超额百分之四十一点六，西北区超额百分之十六点三九。
    各国营煤矿春节前后的出勤情况和春节期间的机电检修工作、煤炭装车工作，比历年都有很大的改进，这对扭转往年二月份常常不能完成计划的局面起了决定性的作用。今年各国营煤矿职工经过总路线的宣传教育，普遍认识到保证出勤完成计划对国家工业化事业的重要意义，因而广泛展开出勤竞赛，很多工人并把保证出勤列为小组作业计划的内容之一，打破了历年来春节缺勤的惯例。许多煤矿在春节以后都迅速做到正常出勤，走上正常的生产。通化矿务局铁厂子矿春节后的出勤率达到百分之九十九点九，营城矿达到百分之九十五点五，淄博矿务局达到百分之九十四点七。今年春节以前，各矿都提前作出了检修计划，每件工程都指定专人负责，并把主要力量集中在平时不能停下来检修的绞车、主扇风机、压风机、锅炉、电气设备、洗煤设备等固定设备上。因为准备工作做得充分，各级领导深入检查，今年春节检修设备的台数和参加检修的人数，都是历年来未有的，并且基本上保证了检修工期和质量。
    为了使工业用煤得到不间断的供应，各矿都特别注意春节期间煤炭的装车工作。华北煤矿管理局在春节前就预先了解各矿的存煤情况，分别派人到现场督促装车。峰峰煤矿为了保证对鞍山钢铁公司炼焦煤的供应，春节并未停产。开滦煤矿也改变往年情况，超额完成了春节装车任务。东北阜新煤矿并和铁路等有关方面成立临时装车委员会，保证装车。经过这些努力，全国国营煤矿完成二月份装车计划百分之九十九点七，保证了炼焦煤和动力煤的供应，保证了铁路的计划运输。
