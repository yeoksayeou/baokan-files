Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: Grain departments in North China are conducting stocktaking, sorting, and sun-drying of stored grain.

    The Grain Bureau of Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province, sorted its grain reserves in twenty-two counties based on moisture and impurity levels, and treated them accordingly. Yuci and Changzhi prefectures adopted methods such as sun-drying, winnowing, and sieving to reduce the moisture content and impurities in over 11.5 million jin of stored grain, bringing it up to safety standards. The Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau has been drying grain extensively since February. All units under the Tianjin Municipal Grain Bureau are also sun-drying grain, with plans to complete the process by the end of April.

    This year, North China's grain reserves have increased nearly twofold compared to last year, and the grain has a high moisture content and more impurities, posing significant challenges to storage. Grain departments across the region are paying close attention to grain storage. In January and February, all provinces and cities in the region established Grain Protection Committees or Grain Protection Offices to oversee grain storage. In mid-March, the Grain Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee dispatched working groups to inspect grain storage in grassroots granaries in Shanxi and Hebei provinces, assisting local areas in improving grain storage. The Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau dispatched 48 cadres in February to various prefectures to assist and promote the work of grain stocktaking and sorting. Departments such as the Baoding Municipal Grain Bureau in Hebei Province also sent cadres to various granaries for general inspection in mid-February.

    Grain storage workers in various regions have also created many methods for storing grain and are paying attention to saving packaging materials. Workers in the grain storage department of Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, created the "furrow sun-drying method" during grain sun-drying, effectively reducing the moisture content of stored grain. Wang Dingxu, a storage worker at the Yongdingmen Warehouse of the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau, created a method of "pouring rice onto the ground, winnowing with high fanning, changing bags, and reducing moisture content," which solved the difficulty of lacking drying space, delayed the heating time of the rice, and yielded good results. The Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau is now promoting this method.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 24th: State-owned grain departments in East China are vigorously addressing the high moisture content of stored rice in the Yangtze River Delta region. Since February 10th, the Grain Bureau of the East China Administrative Committee has dispatched working groups to conduct a major inspection of state-owned grain stored in the Delta region, together with relevant provincial and prefectural grain departments. Departments such as the Procuratorate and cooperatives are also participating in the inspection. Simultaneously with the inspection, grain storage cadres in various counties have launched a grain protection campaign centered on addressing the high moisture content of rice. The primary method for addressing the high moisture content of rice is sun-drying, and their slogan is "Don't miss a single sunny day." In addition to the granaries' existing drying grounds, they have also borrowed all temporarily available sports fields in various places, and many bridges, roadsides, and small vacant lots that can be used have also been utilized. Various places have prepared approximately 200,000 reed mats for use as grain-drying pads. On cloudy days, the grain is moved out to cool, and on rainy days, it is spread out indoors to air. This work has received strong support from local residents, who not only lend out all their drying grounds and utensils but also participate in the grain-drying work. Meteorological observatories in Nanjing and Hangzhou are also very concerned about the country's grain protection efforts and continuously report climate changes to grain departments.

    In addition to sun-drying, various counties have also devised drying methods based on local conditions in their grain protection work. Some cocoon-drying equipment in Suzhou and Jiaxing prefectures has been used to dry rice. Songjiang Prefecture has also created a drying room, and Qingpu County currently has 112 stoves drying rice day and night.

    The Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government has allocated 22 drying machines to the East China region to support the East China grain departments in carefully storing grain. The Yangtze River Delta region, including Suzhou and Songjiang prefectures in Jiangsu Province and Jiaxing Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, is located around Taihu Lake and produces abundant late-maturing Japonica rice. Since the rice harvest began at the end of October last year, it has been raining continuously, making it difficult to thoroughly sun-dry the rice, resulting in extremely high moisture content, mostly above 18%, with the highest reaching 35%.

    华北华东粮食部门进行存粮普查翻晒工作
   【新华社二十四日讯】华北各地粮食部门正在作存粮的普查排队和整理翻晒工作。
    山西省榆次专区粮食局根据粮食含水分、杂质的程度，将所属二十二个县的库存粮作了排队，分别处理。榆次、长治两专区采取翻晒、过风、过筛等方法，使一千一百五十多万斤存粮含水量降低，杂质减少，达到安全标准。北京市粮食局从二月份起就大量晾粮。天津市粮食局所属各单位也都在翻晒粮食，计划在四月底基本翻晒完毕。
    今年华北的存粮比去年增加近一倍，而且粮食水分大，含杂质较多，给保管工作增加很大困难。各地粮食部门对粮食保管工作非常重视。全区各省市在一、二月份先后成立了护粮委员会或护粮办公室，负责粮食保管的督导工作。华北行政委员会粮食局在三月中旬派出工作组，分别到山西、河北两省基层粮库检查粮食保管情况，协助各地作好保管粮食的工作。山西省粮食厅二月份派出干部四十八人，分组到各专区去帮助并推动作粮食的清仓排队工作。河北省保定市粮食局等部门也在二月中旬派干部到各粮库进行普查。
    各地粮食保管部门的职工还创造出许多保管粮食的办法，并注意节省包装物料。山西省寿阳县粮食保管部门的职工在翻晒粮食中，创造“垄沟翻晒法”，有效地降低了存粮的水分。北京市粮食局永定门仓库保管员王定序创造了“大米倒地、高扬出风、换袋、降低水分”的办法，解决了缺少摊晾地点的困难，推延了大米发热时间，收效很好，现在北京市粮食局正在推广这个办法。
   【新华社上海二十四日电】华东国营粮食部门正大力处理长江三角洲地区所存稻谷的高水分问题。从二月十日开始，华东行政委员会粮食局就派出工作组，会同有关各省和各专区的粮食部门，对三角洲地区储藏的国家粮食进行大检查。参加检查的有检察署、合作社等部门。和检查同时，各县粮食保管干部展开了以处理稻谷高水分为中心的保粮工作。处理稻谷高水分最主要的办法是曝晒，他们的口号是“不放过一个晴天”，除粮库原有的晒场外，并借用了各地所有可以暂借的运动场，许多桥头、路侧可以利用的小空地也都利用上了，各地准备了约二十万张芦席作为晒粮用的垫子。阴天把粮食搬出摊凉，雨天摊在屋内过风。这一工作得到当地居民的大力支持，他们不单借出所有的晒场、用具，还参加了晒粮工作。南京、杭州的气象台也十分关心国家的保粮工作，都不断地向粮食部门报告气候变化的情况。
    各县在保粮工作中除曝晒外，他们还因地制宜想出了烘干的办法。在苏州和嘉兴专区的一些烘茧设备已被利用烘干稻谷。松江专区还创造了一种烘干室，青浦县现有一百十二只炉子在日夜烘干稻谷。
    中央人民政府粮食部已拨给华东区二十二部烘干机，支持华东粮食部门认真保管粮食。长江三角洲地区，包括江苏省的苏州专区、松江专区和浙江省的嘉兴专区，地处太湖四周，盛产晚熟粳稻。去年十月底稻谷收割开始这里就络续下雨，稻谷很难彻底曝晒，因而稻谷所含水分极高，大部分在百分之十八以上，最高的达到百分之三十五。
