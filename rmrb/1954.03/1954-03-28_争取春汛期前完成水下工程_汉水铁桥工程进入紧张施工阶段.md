To strive to complete the underwater engineering before the spring flood season, all the staff and military personnel participating in the Han River Railway Bridge project are working day and night.

The key to the current underwater engineering of the Han River Railway Bridge is to rush the repair of the No. 4 pier project out of the water and to position and sink the No. 5 pier wooden caisson. After the No. 4 pier is driven with steel sheet pile cofferdam and the bottom is sealed, the water in the cofferdam can be pumped out, the model board can be erected, and the concrete for the foundation and pier body can be poured. However, because the water level of the Han River rose briefly in early March, a large amount of water continuously poured into the cofferdam from the leaks, which greatly increased the difficulty of pumping water. In order to stop the influx of river water, on March 11, ten workers from the Wuhan Civil Ship Management Office participating in the Han River Bridge project took off their cotton clothes and went into the water naked to plug the leaks without waiting to borrow diving suits. Subsequently, the loading and unloading workers of the Liu Deqing team, Chen Yunsheng team, and Zhang Sen team, as well as interns Sun Yiyun and Li Yingzhong, also went into the water to plug the holes. At the same time, water pumps were added, and by the 19th, the water in the cofferdam had been drained. Now preparations are being made to pour the pier.

Using a wooden caisson instead of a steel sheet pile cofferdam for the No. 5 pier is a first in the history of bridge engineering in our country, and the technicians and workers have no experience. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, all workers and technicians are rushing to build the wooden caisson. The caulking work of making the wooden caisson is the most labor-intensive. In order to complete this task well and quickly, the carpenters launched a labor competition. On the 9th, carpenter Ge Zhengliang created a record of caulking 11.7 meters in one day. On the 11th, Ding Duguan set a new record of caulking 16.6 meters per day, breaking the target, and the quality also met the requirements. After the competition was launched, most workers were able to caulk more than 10 meters per day. In the past few days, the engineers of the engineering bureau and the engineering section have determined the floating, sinking, and positioning methods of the wooden caisson through careful research, and completed the sinking of the first section of the wooden caisson on the 19th.

After being trained in driving piles for the No. 6 pier, a certain unit of the Railway Corps, which is responsible for driving piles for the No. 7 pier, is now able to skillfully operate the universal pile driver. The comrades of the three-row shaker group helped to push and connect the piles immediately after lifting the piles, driving 80 meters of piles in four hours. The comrades of the first class of the fourth row created a new record of driving 200 meters. The workers in the concrete work area are preparing for the third section of the Hankou bank bridge abutment, and the second section of the No. 1 pier and the No. 6 pier to pour concrete; the workers who wash the gravel launched a competition, sifting and washing overnight. The Zhang Yutang group, which washed gravel on the Hanyang bank, washed 17.5 cubic meters of gravel in one shift and one working day; Zhang Fengshan and other six groups responsible for pouring concrete on the Hankou bank, each person averaged one cubic meter of gravel per day, and the efficiency increased by one times. The competition is getting higher and higher.

On March 18, the pile driving work of the No. 7 pier was completed; at noon on the 19th, the pile driving work of the No. 3 pier was also successfully completed.

    争取春汛期前完成水下工程
    汉水铁桥工程进入紧张施工阶段
    为了争取在春汛期前完成水下工程，参加汉水铁桥工程的全体职工和军工，正在日夜紧张地劳动着。
    汉水铁桥当前水下工程的关键是把四号墩工程抢修出水面和五号墩木沉井定位下沉，四号墩打好钢钣桩围堰，封完了底，就可以抽出围堰里的水，立模型板，浇注基础和墩身的混凝土。但是因为三月上旬汉水水位一度上涨，围堰外的水不断从漏洞大量涌入，给抽水工作增加了很大困难。为了制止河水涌进，三月十一日，参加汉水桥工程的武汉市民船管理处十个工人，不等借到潜水衣，就脱掉棉衣，光着身子下水堵塞漏洞。接着，刘德卿班、陈允生班、张森班的装吊工人和实习生孙义云、李应钟等也都下水堵洞。同时增加抽水机，到十九日，堰内的水已经抽干，现在准备浇注桥墩。
    五号墩用木沉井代替钢钣桩围堰，这在我国桥梁工程史上还是第一次，技术人员和工人都没有经验。在苏联专家指导下，全体工人、技术人员正在赶制木沉井。做木沉井的嵌缝工作量最大，木工同志为了又好又快地完成这项任务，展开了劳动竞赛。九日，木工葛正亮创造了一天嵌十一点七公尺的纪录。十一日，丁杜官又创日嵌十六点六公尺的新纪录，突破指标，质量也都合乎要求。开展竞赛后，大部分工人每天都能嵌缝十公尺以上。几天来，工程局和工程段的工程师们经过缜密的研究，确定了木沉井的浮运、下沉、定位的方法，并在十九日完成了第一节木沉井的下沉工作。
    担负七号墩打桩工作的铁道兵某部，经过在六号墩打桩的锻炼，现已能够熟练地操纵万能打桩机。三排摇车组的同志吊好桩，马上就帮助推桩接桩工作，四小时内打桩八十公尺。四排一班的同志又创造了打二百公尺的新纪录。混凝土工区工人正进行汉口岸桥台第三节、一号墩和六号墩第二节浇灌混凝土的准备工作；洗石碴的工人们开展了竞赛，连夜筛洗，在汉阳岸洗石碴的张玉堂小组，一班一个工作日洗石碴十七点五立方公尺；汉口岸负责浇灌混凝土的张凤山等六个小组，每人每天平均洗一立方公尺石碴，效率提高了一倍。竞赛热潮越来越高。
    三月十八日，七号墩打桩工作全部完成；十九日中午三号墩打桩工作也胜利完成。
