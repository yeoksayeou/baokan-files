The Korean art troupe accompanying the Korean People's Delegation to China has brought excellent art to the Chinese people that is growing stronger in battle and full of patriotism and internationalism. Korean music and dance are by no means unfamiliar to the broad masses of the Chinese people, but rather quite familiar and universally welcomed and loved. This performance by the art troupe has broadened the horizons of Chinese audiences and enabled them to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Korean art. The Korean National Art Theater, the Korean People's Army Ensemble, and the Korean National Classical Art Theater have presented us with many outstanding programs. Each program has a distinct style and unique creativity. The musical works are deeply moving, and the dance works also display their own characteristics.

The "Rose" performed by the National Art Theater is a very imaginative and beautiful work. The entire stage atmosphere and the image of the actors can make people imagine how dewdrops-laden roses bloom in the morning sun, making people seem to smell the fragrance of roses. When the storm comes, the roses sway and bump under the attack of wind and rain; but they finally proudly triumph. After the storm, the bright sunshine reappears, and the rose bushes bloom even more brilliantly. This work symbolizes the indomitable will of Korean women in struggle and has an encouraging power. "Welcoming Spring Dance" is also a pleasant and beautiful work, with melodious folk song melodies closely accompanying the beautiful dance, which is a common feature of Korean folk dance. The dancers of the National Art Theater have used artistic techniques to more prominently express this characteristic and endow it with new realistic significance.

These beautiful Korean national dances remind people of the beautiful Korean natural scenery and the simple Korean people who love peace. Although the war has destroyed some buildings, the Daedong River is still green, and the pine forest on Moran Hill is still verdant. Although the Korean people have suffered from the war, the traditional beautiful songs and dances have not stopped but are still popular among the people. I remember when the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea concluded its performance in Kaifeng County, Korea, last year, to慰问the Korean people, a true-to-life scene like the one performed in the "Farmers' Song" by the National Classical Art Theater appeared in the "open-air theater" among the broken walls: farmers wearing paper flower hats, beating gongs and drums, peasant women beating hand drums, or clapping their arms in unison. They warmly expressed their love for the Chinese people. Whether performers or audience, old or young, they all had an optimistic and simple temperament. This kind of dance has been passed down from generation to generation among the people for more than 1,300 years. In this long era, the Korean people have experienced countless struggles and hardships, but the people still preserve their own national dance. The dancers of the National Classical Art Theater bring this people's dance to the stage, on the one hand, to more prominently express the farmers' optimism, and on the other hand, to give it a more refined treatment in artistic form. We can breathe the atmosphere of the Korean countryside from "Farmers' Song," which is a beautiful work of art.

The dance works of the Korean People's Army Ensemble have another distinct characteristic. The creative themes are combined with the life of the People's Army. For example, "Soldiers' Dance" learns from the Soviet creative methods, and the characters that appear are Korean warriors who have been tested in battle. The form is lively and diverse. For example, "Peace and Friendship" combines the national dances of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries into a colorful program, expressing the joyous scenes of young people from around the world at the festival. From these two programs, we can see that the Korean People's Army Ensemble is working very hard in learning the advanced Soviet dance art and the dance art of various fraternal countries. These programs fully demonstrate that the people's culture and art under the leadership of the working class are full of internationalist spirit. Only people who know how to respect their own national art know better how to respect the excellent art of other nations.

During the arduous Patriotic War, Korean dancers served the motherland with their art, and some even gave their lives. During the period of rehabilitation and construction, they continued to exert their talents. Like the dancers of the National Art Theater, they are building theaters and houses for themselves while stepping up their technical training. For example, at the National Choi Seung-hee Dance Research Institute in the countryside, oil lamps are still lit for rehearsals at night. Korean dancers have completed many excellent works under difficult material conditions. This revolutionary optimism in the face of difficulties and this serious and conscientious attitude towards their art deeply touched us. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, Korean dancers will achieve greater achievements and create richer and more splendid works during the period of peaceful construction.

    朝鲜人民的优美舞蹈艺术
    陈锦清
    随同朝鲜人民访华代表团来我国的朝鲜艺术团为中国人民带来了在战斗中日益壮大的，充满了爱国主义与国际主义精神的优秀艺术。朝鲜的音乐与舞蹈，对中国广大人民说来，决不是陌生的，而是相当熟悉的，普遍受到欢迎和热爱的。这次艺术团的表演，使中国观众对朝鲜的艺术更扩大了眼界，得到了多方面的了解。朝鲜国立艺术剧场、朝鲜人民军协奏团、朝鲜国立古典艺术剧场三个单位给我们演出了不少卓越的节目。各个节目具有鲜明的风格和独特的创造性。音乐作品给人以极深的感受，舞蹈作品也显示了自己的特色。
    国立艺术剧场演出的“蔷薇”，是一个很有意想而美丽的作品，整个舞台气氛和演员的形象，可以令人想像到带着露珠的蔷薇花怎样在朝阳中开放，使人仿佛闻到了蔷薇的清香。当暴风雨来临的时候，蔷薇花在风雨的袭击中摇曳颠簸；但它们终于骄傲地取得了胜利。风雨过后，明媚的阳光重新出现，蔷薇花丛开得更加鲜艳。这个作品象征着朝鲜妇女在斗争中坚韧不拔的意志，具有鼓舞的力量。“迎春舞”也是一个愉快而优美的作品，悠扬的民歌旋律紧密地伴随着美妙的舞姿，这是朝鲜民间舞蹈具有的共同特点。国立艺术剧场的舞蹈家们通过艺术的手法，更突出地表现了这个特点，并赋予它新的现实的意义。
    这些优美的朝鲜的民族舞蹈，令人想起山清水秀的朝鲜自然景色，想起热爱和平的纯朴的朝鲜人民。战争虽然摧毁了一些建筑物，但大同江水依然碧绿，牡丹峰上的松林依然苍翠。朝鲜人民虽然受到战争的迫害，传统的优美歌舞并没有停止，仍然在人民中普遍流行。我记得，当中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团去年在朝鲜开封郡慰问朝鲜人民演出完毕时，在断壁残垣的“露天剧场”中，出现了像国立古典艺术剧场的“农民歌”中所表演的真实生活：农民们带着花纸帽，敲打着锣鼓，农妇们打着手鼓，或者两臂合拍地舞动着。他们热情地流露出对中国人民的友爱。无论是表演者或观众，年老的年少的，都有一种乐观和朴实的气质。这种舞蹈在人民中一代继一代地流传下来已有一千三百多年了，在这悠长的年代中，朝鲜人民经历了无数斗争和磨难，但是人民依然保存着自己民族的舞蹈。国立古典艺术剧场的舞蹈家们，把这种人民的舞蹈搬上舞台，一方面，更突出地表现出农民们的乐观主义精神，另一方面，在艺术形式上给予更精练的处理。我们从“农民歌”中可以呼吸到朝鲜农村的气息，这是一个精美的艺术作品。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的舞蹈作品，有着另一种鲜明的特点，创作题材是和人民军的生活相结合的，如“士兵之舞”是学习了苏联的创作方法，出现的人物形象是经过战斗考验的朝鲜勇士。形式是生动活泼而多样的，如“和平与友谊”把苏联以及各兄弟国家的民族舞蹈组成一个多彩的节目，表现世界青年在联欢节中的欢乐情景。从这两个节目可以看到朝鲜人民军协奏团在学习先进的苏联舞蹈艺术和各兄弟国家的舞蹈艺术方面，是十分努力的。这些节目充分地说明了在工人阶级领导之下的人民文化艺术是充满着国际主义的精神的。只有懂得尊重自己民族艺术的人民才更懂得尊重别的民族的优秀艺术。
    朝鲜的舞蹈家们在艰苦的卫国战争中，以自己的艺术为祖国服务，有些甚至献出了自己的生命。在恢复建设时期，他们继续发挥着自己的才能。像国立艺术剧场的舞蹈家们，一边为自己修建剧场和房舍，一边加紧技术锻炼。又如在乡村里的国立崔承喜舞蹈研究所，夜晚还点着油灯进行排练。朝鲜的舞蹈家们在困难的物质条件下完成了许多优秀的作品，这种与困难斗争的革命的乐观主义精神，这种以严肃认真的态度对待自己的艺术的劳动，深深地感动了我们。我们深信朝鲜的舞蹈家们在和平建设时期，在劳动党和金日成元帅的英明领导下，将取得更大的成就，创造出更丰富更绚丽的作品来。（附图片）
