Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 15th: According to TASS, the Tenth Inter-American Conference held in Caracas, Venezuela, concluded its discussion on the so-called "Resolution Against Communism" draft proposed by the United States, which in reality was aimed at ensuring the United States' ability to interfere in the internal affairs of American countries. The aggressive nature of this US proposal can be seen from the discussions in the Judicial and Political Issues Committee.

For example, according to an Associated Press reporter, Mexican representative Roberto Córdova said in his speech that the US proposal "could be interpreted in the future in such a way that a certain country or group of countries could interfere in the affairs of another country." He pointed out that the Mexican government believes that "every country has the right to elect a government it likes."

Argentine representative Rodolfo Muñoz supported the Mexican representative's opinion, saying that Argentina "for its own benefit and the benefit of its brother republics" rejects the policy of intervention.

Guatemalan Foreign Minister Toriello exposed the aggressive nature of the United States' policy towards Latin American countries, saying that Guatemala "cannot tolerate others interfering in its internal affairs under any pretext."

Latin American newspapers also recognized the interventionist purpose of the US proposal. The Brazilian newspaper "Jornal do Brasil" said that the Guatemalan delegation's opposition to the US proposal at the Caracas conference was to defend Guatemala's right to handle its own affairs "free from foreign interference." The newspaper expressed opposition to attempts to describe any national independence movement and any "struggle for economic liberation" as instigated by the Communists, "because this could seriously worsen relations between countries on the American continent."

The Uruguayan newspaper "Acción" wrote: "The United States has no right to describe the people's self-defense against the oppression of monopoly capital as a communist movement."

The Uruguayan Catholic newspaper "El Bien Público" refuted the claim that Dulles' proposal was intended to deal with "possible aggression from the Soviet Union," writing: "No one believes that the Soviet Union would attack any country on the American continent." The newspaper emphasized that the United States is afraid of the emergence of united governments in Latin America that would defend their countries' national independence and oppose US interference.

Long before the US proposal was put to a vote, US newspapers had indicated that the United States would put pressure on the participating representatives to ensure the passage of the proposal.

An Associated Press dispatch from Caracas said that during the four-hour vote on the US proposal on March 13, the United States blocked all attempts to pass amendments on "social and economic issues." The US proposal received seventeen votes, Guatemala voted against it, and Mexico and Argentina abstained.

Latin American newspapers sharply criticized the United States' attempt to use the Tenth Inter-American Conference to promote its aggressive policies. The Ecuadorian newspaper "El Pueblo" wrote that under the pretext of "defending the continent," the United States was attempting at the conference to "finally strike at the freedom of Latin America." The newspaper emphasized that the Caracas conference "is nothing more than a trap to bind Latin America more tightly."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 13th: TASS reported that the "New York Post" published an editorial commenting on the progress of the Tenth Inter-American Conference held in Caracas, Venezuela, saying: "Dulles went to Caracas to attend the conference to organize an anti-communist front, but what he will leave behind is an embryonic front against 'Americanism'. Any verbal victory we win cannot hide the deep psychological failure we have suffered..." The newspaper continued: "Even right-wing dictators like Venezuela's Pérez Jiménez showed more concern for the specter of American 'interventionism' raised by Guatemala than for Dulles' accusations of communist infiltration. Jiménez is precisely reflecting the widespread suspicion of the United States that exists in Latin American countries..."

The "New York Post" concluded: "The cheers that greeted the Guatemalan Foreign Minister's attack on us and the silent silence that met Dulles' eloquent defenses stand in ominous contrast."

    拉丁美洲各国舆论反对美国干涉内政
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯举行的第十届泛美会议，结束了美国提出的所谓“反对共产主义决议”草案的讨论，这个草案实际上是为了保证美国能够干涉美洲国家的内政。这个美国提案的侵略性质可以从司法和政治问题委员会的讨论情况中看出来。
    例如，据美联社记者说，墨西哥代表罗伯托·科多巴在发言中说，美国的建议“在以后可以作这样的解释，使某一个国家或国家集团可以干涉另一国家的事务”。他指出，墨西哥政府认为，“每一个国家有权选出一个它所喜欢的政府”。
    阿根廷代表罗道夫·蒙诺斯支持墨西哥代表的意见，他说，阿根廷“为它自己以及各兄弟共和国的利益”，拒绝干涉政策。
    危地马拉外长托里埃略揭露了美国对拉丁美洲国家的政策的侵略性质，他说，危地马拉“不能容忍别人以任何借口干涉它的内政”。
    拉丁美洲报纸也认识到美国提案的干涉目的。巴西报纸“新闻日报”说，危地马拉代表团在加拉加斯会议上反对美国提案，就是保卫危地马拉“不受外国干涉”自行处理问题的权利。该报表示反对企图把任何民族独立运动和任何“争取经济解放的斗争”说成是共产党主使的，“因为这可能使得美洲大陆国家间的关系严重恶化”。
    乌拉圭报纸“行动报”写道：“美国没有权利把人民反对垄断资本压迫的自卫举动说成是共产主义运动。”
    乌拉圭天主教报纸“公益报”驳斥所谓杜勒斯提案是为了对付“可能来自苏联的侵略”的说法，它写道：“没有一个人相信苏联会进攻美洲大陆上的任何国家。”该报强调指出，美国是害怕拉丁美洲出现会保卫它们的国家的民族独立并反对美国的干涉的联合政府。
    在美国提案付诸表决前很久，美国报纸就表示过，美国要对与会代表施加压力，以保证提案的通过。
    美联社加拉加斯消息说，在三月十三日就美国的提案举行历时四小时的表决时，美国阻挠了通过关于“社会和经济问题”修正案的一切企图。美国提案获得了十七票，危地马拉投反对票，墨西哥和阿根廷弃权。
    拉丁美洲报纸尖锐地抨击了美国想利用第十届泛美会议来推行其侵略政策的做法。厄瓜多尔报纸
  “人民报”写道，在“保卫大陆”的借口下，美国在会议上企图“最后打击拉丁美洲的自由”。该报强调说，加拉加斯会议“只不过是用来更紧地束缚拉丁美洲的一个圈套而已”。
   【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：
  “纽约邮报”发表社论评论在委内瑞拉的加拉加斯召开的第十届泛美会议的进展情况说：“杜勒斯到加拉加斯去出席会议是要组织一个反共阵线，但是他留下的将是一个萌芽中的反对‘美国主义’的阵线。我们所赢得的任何口头胜利，都不能掩盖我们所遭受的深重的心理失败……”该报继续说：“甚至像委内瑞拉的佩雷兹·吉门尼斯这样的右翼独裁者，对危地马拉提出的美国‘干涉主义’的妖怪所表示的关心，也比对杜勒斯提出的关于共产党渗入的指责所表示的关心为大。吉门尼斯正是反映了拉丁美洲国家普遍存在的对美国的怀疑……”
    “纽约邮报”最后说：“危地马拉外交部长攻击我们时受到的喝采和杜勒斯的滔滔辩才遇到的无声的沉默，恰成不祥的对照。”
