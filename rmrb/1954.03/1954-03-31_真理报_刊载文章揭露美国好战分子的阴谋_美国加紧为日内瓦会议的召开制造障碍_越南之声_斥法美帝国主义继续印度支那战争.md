Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: TASS, Moscow, March 29th: "Pravda" published an article by D. Yelyutin, commenting on the obstruction of the preparations for the Geneva Conference by those who do not wish to ease international tensions.

The article said that in order to hinder the peaceful settlement of Asian countries' problems, the American reactionary forces have also brought their South Korean and Taiwanese puppets onto the stage.

Syngman Rhee is clamoring that the Geneva Conference will not yield results and clamoring to restart the "Northern Expedition." The Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan are not to be outdone by their South Korean counterparts. In order to increase their worth, they are again clamoring for a "counterattack on the mainland."

The article said that if one only looks at the clamoring of Syngman Rhee and the Kuomintang elements, it is not worth noting. They are noteworthy only because they reflect the intentions of some Americans, namely, on the one hand, to create more difficulties for the convening of the Geneva Conference, and on the other hand, to instigate their agents to take action against the increasingly strong demands of European and Asian public opinion for a peaceful settlement of the two major Asian issues.

However, the whole world knows that Syngman Rhee and his Taiwanese counterparts always reflect the opinions of their masters across the ocean, and nothing else. Everyone clearly knows that these puppets cannot represent Asian public opinion.

The article went on to say that on the eve of the Geneva Conference, the United States intensified its efforts to put together a new "anti-communist alliance" in the Pacific through its South Korean puppet, which is not accidental.

For this purpose, South Korea sent a special mission to Southeast Asian countries. In fact, they did not achieve any important results. Only representatives of the dying Kuomintang regime and the Indochina puppet regime agreed to participate in the "anti-communist" conference.

What is the purpose of directing this farce of piecing together a new so-called "anti-communist crusade" alliance on the eve of the Geneva Conference?

The purpose is to enable the U.S. diplomacy to stir up new anti-communist hysteria, poison the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference, thereby helping the U.S. to pursue a line against the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and against the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The article concluded by saying that the clamoring of these puppets cannot suppress the voices of the Asian people demanding a peaceful settlement of the Korean and Indochinese issues. The Asian people demand that the Geneva Conference resolve the outstanding issues and establish lasting peace in Asia and other parts of the world.

The Asian people want peace and oppose the conspiracies of the enemies of peace. This ensures that provocative conspiracies aimed at undermining the Geneva Conference will be defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th: According to Vietnam News Agency, March 28th: "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast an article commenting on the fact that imperialists, after their defeat in Dien Bien Phu, are still stubbornly trying to prolong the war of aggression in Indochina.

The article said that the French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" recently pointed out, in commenting on the military situation in Dien Bien Phu, that the French imperialists' policy of resolving the Indochina issue by force has gone bankrupt. The newspaper also pointed out that the French army continues to be wiped out in Dien Bien Phu, but Laniel still refuses to take the only road leading to peace - negotiations with President Ho Chi Minh.

The article said that the warmongers in France and the United States are doing their best to save the critical situation in the besieged area and continue the war of aggression against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

The French High Command has mobilized all military aircraft and civil aviation companies to rush reinforcements and supplies. At the same time, the French colonialists hastily dispatched a thousand soldiers on the "Pasteur" liner to Indochina, and the American imperialists are also planning to send O'Daniel to help Navarre formulate military plans and train puppet troops.

The article said that the Vietnamese people maintain a high degree of vigilance. They are determined to smash all the enemy's vicious conspiracies in order to defend national independence and peace.

### “真理报”刊载文章揭露美国好战分子的阴谋  美国加紧为日内瓦会议的召开制造障碍  “越南之声”斥法美帝国主义继续印度支那战争

    “真理报”刊载文章揭露美国好战分子的阴谋
    美国加紧为日内瓦会议的召开制造障碍
    “越南之声”斥法美帝国主义继续印度支那战争
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：“真理报”刊载了杰柳辛的一篇文章，评论那些不希望缓和国际紧张局势的人们对日内瓦会议的准备工作所加的阻挠。
    文章说，为了阻挠亚洲国家的问题的和平解决，美国反动势力叫他们的南朝鲜和台湾傀儡也粉墨登场了。
    李承晚在叫嚷着日内瓦会议不会得到结果，并叫嚣要重新“北进”，台湾国民党渣滓也不甘落后于他们的南朝鲜同行，为了抬高身价，他们又在叫嚷要“反攻大陆”。
    文章说，如果只看李承晚和国民党分子的这些叫嚷，那是不值得注意的。它们之所以引人注意，只是由于它们反映了某些美国人士的意图，那就是一方面为日内瓦会议的召开制造更多的困难，另一方面唆使他们的代理人采取行动来反对欧亚舆论对和平解决亚洲两大问题的日益强烈的要求。
    但是，举世皆知，李承晚和他的台湾同行所反映的总是他们的大洋彼岸的主子们的意见，而不是其他。每个人都清楚地知道，这些傀儡是不能代表亚洲舆论的。
    文章接着说，就在日内瓦会议前夕，美国加紧努力，想通过它的南朝鲜傀儡在太平洋拼凑新的“反共联盟”，这并不是偶然的。
    为了这个目的，南朝鲜派了一个特别使团到东南亚各国。事实上，他们没有获得任何重要的结果。只有垂死的国民党政权和印度支那伪政权的代表同意参加“反共”会议。
    在日内瓦会议开会前夕导演这幕拼凑新的所谓“反共十字军”联盟的丑剧，其目的何在呢？
    目的是使美国外交方面能够煽起新的反共歇斯底里，毒化日内瓦会议的气氛，从而帮助美国奉行反对和平解决朝鲜问题和反对恢复印度支那和平的路线。
    文章最后说，但是，这些傀儡们的叫嚷是压制不了亚洲人民要求和平解决朝鲜和印度支那问题的呼声的。亚洲人民要求日内瓦会议解决悬而未决的问题，并在亚洲和世界其它地方建立巩固的和平。
    亚洲人民希望和平，反对和平的敌人的阴谋。这就保证以破坏日内瓦会议为目的的挑衅阴谋将要遭到失败。
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社二十八日讯：“越南之声”电台广播了一篇文章，评论帝国主义者在奠边府失败后，仍顽固地要延长印度支那的侵略战争。
    文章说，法国的资产阶级报纸“战斗报”最近在评论奠边府的军事形势时指出，法帝国主义者武力解决印度支那问题的政策已经破产。该报并且指出，法国军队继续在奠边府被消灭，但拉尼埃仍拒绝走引向和平的唯一道路——与胡志明主席进行谈判。
    文章说，法国和美国的好战分子都在竭力想挽救这个被围地区的危急局势，继续进行侵略越南、高棉与寮国的战争。
    法军总司令部已经动用了所有军用飞机与民用航空公司的飞机来赶运援兵与供应品。同时，法国殖民者仓皇派遣了一千名士兵乘“巴士德号”轮船到印度支那来，美帝国主义者也正在计划派遣奥丹尼尔帮助纳瓦尔制定军事计划并训练伪军。
    文章说，越南人民保持着高度的警惕。他们决心粉碎敌人的一切恶毒阴谋，以保卫民族的独立与和平。
