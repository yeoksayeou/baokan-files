    Hankou Automobile Parts Factory Completes First Quarter Plan Ahead of Schedule
    The Hankou Automobile Parts Factory completed its product plan for the first quarter of this year fifteen days ahead of schedule on March 16th.
    The factory's production targets for the first quarter of this year were generally higher than the actual production results of the fourth quarter of last year. Since January of this year, the factory's labor productivity has significantly improved compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Among the three products, piston pins increased by 33 percent, while cylinder liners and copper sleeves both increased by 39 percent. Since January, the factory has also eliminated personal and machine tool accidents, as well as overtime work. In terms of financial costs, the factory's overall cost in January decreased by 35.87 percent, and in February it decreased by 34.62 percent, saving a total of over 500 million yuan in funds. As a result of increased production and savings, the factory's profit turned over to the state in January increased by seven times compared to the state plan, and in February it also increased by nearly six times.
    This year, under the impetus of the inter-factory competition among machinery factories in the city, the factory strengthened planning management and political work. It learned from and promoted the experience of the Jiang'an Machine Factory, established scheduling meetings and daily meetings, established a daily analysis and inspection system for output and quality, and a daily report system for semi-finished products. It also implemented effective "process transfer cards" throughout the factory, which enabled it to promptly identify and overcome weak links in production, control the supply of work-in-progress and semi-finished products, and ensure balanced production. At the same time, it stepped up the publicity and education of the general line, widely carried out labor competitions in the factory, mobilized technical personnel to go deep into the workshops, combined the scientific theories of technical personnel with the labor creativity of workers, and launched a rationalization proposal movement. In February, the Liren Shaft Steel Pin Group adopted rationalization proposals to improve nine processes, and another group also put forward thirteen rationalization proposals in February, which improved output and quality and solved the problem of unbalanced production capacity.
    After completing the first quarter product plan ahead of schedule, the factory has put forward increased production figures, calling on all employees to increase the country's wealth by 1.2 billion yuan in the first quarter of this year.

    汉口汽车配件厂提前完成第一季度计划
    汉口汽车配件厂在三月十六日提前十五天完成了今年第一季度产品计划。
    该厂今年第一季度的产量指标一般都高于去年第四季度的生产实绩。今年一月以来，该厂劳动生产率比去年第四季度都有显著提高，在三种产品中，活塞肖提高了百分之三十三，汽缸套和铜套都提高了百分之三十九。一月份以来，该厂还消灭了人身、机床事故和加班加点的现象。在财务成本方面，一月份该厂总的成本降低了百分之三十五点八七，二月份降低了百分之三十四点六二，共节约了五亿余元的资金。由于增产节约的结果，该厂一月份上缴利润比国家计划增加了七倍，二月份也增加了将近六倍。
    该厂今年在本市机械工厂厂际竞赛的推动下，加强了计划管理和政治工作。学习推广了江岸机厂的经验，建立了调度会议和日常会议，建立了每天产量、质量分析检查的制度和半成品日报制度，并在全厂推行了行之有效的“工序交拨卡”，因而能及时发现并克服生产上的薄弱环节，控制了在制品和半成品的供应，保证了均衡生产。同时，抓紧了总路线的宣传教育，在厂内广泛地开展了劳动竞赛，发动了技术人员深入车间，使技术人员的科学理论和工人的劳动创造智慧相结合，并开展了合理化建议运动。在二月份，立人轴钢板肖小组采用合理化建议改进了九道工序，另一个小组在二月份也提出了十三件合理化建议，提高了产量、质量，解决了生产能力不平衡的问题。
    该厂在提前完成第一季度产品计划后，已提出了增产数字，号召全厂职工在今年第一季度为国家增产十二亿元的财富。
