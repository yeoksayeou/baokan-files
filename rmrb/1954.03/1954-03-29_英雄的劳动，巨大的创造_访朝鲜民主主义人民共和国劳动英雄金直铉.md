    Heroic Labor, Immense Creation
    ——An Interview with Kim Chik-hyon, Labor Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    Lian Yunshan
    Among the members of the Korean People's Delegation to China, I interviewed Kim Chik-hyon, a miner from the Aoji Mine in North Hamgyong Province. His modest account of his history and heroic labor during the war moved me deeply. His thoughts and deeds prominently display the excellent qualities of the Korean working class: kindness, simplicity, diligence, and bravery.

    Kim Chik-hyon is thirty-five years old this year. When he was born, his motherland was under the rule of Japanese imperialism, and they lived through the painful years of colonial people. As a child, Kim Chik-hyon lived in a family that labored all year round but could not get enough to eat. At the age of fourteen, he went to the Aoji Mine to work as a miner, but the mine was owned by the barbaric Japanese imperialists. Here, he did even more arduous labor, but what he earned was still not enough to fill his stomach, and he still lived a miserable life like a slave. During the "Zhanggufeng Incident" in 1938, influenced by the victory of the Soviet Red Army, the miners, unable to endure the treatment like cattle and horses, staged a riot, but the riot was suppressed by the barbaric Japanese imperialists. Kim Chik-hyon and other miners returned to the mine to endure a life of poverty and humiliation. It was not until the unforgettable "August 15th" that Kim Chik-hyon ended the long years of suffering as a colonial miner and became the master of the country.

    At this time, he deeply understood his blood ties with the Republic and the Workers' Party. Therefore, he actively participated in restoring the mine's work and began selfless labor and studying culture. Only then did Kim Chik-hyon learn the written language of his motherland. From the beginning of the mine's planned production in 1947, although the state continuously increased production quotas, Kim Chik-hyon also continuously overfulfilled production tasks. In 1947, he completed 130 percent; in 1948, he completed 150 percent; and in 1949, he completed 105 percent. For his outstanding production achievements, the government of the Republic awarded him a "Merit Medal." The high honor given to him by the state was a great encouragement to him. He could not be satisfied with his existing achievements and wanted to strive for even greater accomplishments. At this time, Kim Chik-hyon labored in the mine during the day and studied the advanced Soviet mining experience at night. He wanted to contribute everything to the brilliant future of the motherland.

    However, not long after, the war broke out. Kim Chik-hyon listened to the broadcast speech of the wise leader General Kim Il-sung "Everything for the freedom and independence of the motherland, everything for the front" with a heavy heart in front of the radio. The next day, most of the miners joined the army to go to the front to fight for the victory of the war. Kim Chik-hyon was an old skilled worker, and he had to stay and persist in production to support the war. At this time, many workers' families and women came to the mine to replace the soldiers. Kim Chik-hyon felt it was his responsibility to quickly teach the women the skills of mining. They persisted in production under various difficult conditions such as enemy air raids and frequent power outages. By 1952, due to the needs of the war, the mine had to greatly increase production to supply the front. At this time, Kim Chik-hyon began to painstakingly study methods to increase production. He wondered if he could increase production by using continuous blasting of coal seams like firing a machine gun? He read through all the technical books on mining. He had seen the Japanese use blasting to mine coal, but the Japanese books stipulated that only single blasting could be used at a time, and the deepest blast could only be two meters, and it had to be a soft ore body. At this time, Kim Chik-hyon thought: We must learn the spirit of Stakhanov and make a revolution. I want to use multiple continuous blasting. So, he began to experiment with drilling two blast holes and blasting them at the same time, but the first time they did not explode at the same time. When one blast went off first, it broke the fuse of the other blast, thus extinguishing the fire. The experiment failed. The mine's production minister, Kim Ki-chan (he was an expert), inspected the study and believed that this method was feasible, only because Kim Chik-hyon lacked mathematical knowledge and had not done it well. The second experiment was successful. Although production was greatly increased, it took more manpower, time, and explosives. Then Kim Chik-hyon carefully studied and began the third experiment. He increased from two blast holes to drilling twenty-two blast holes of different depths on a large area of the coal seam to make them explode at the same time. It was not until the fourth time that it was completely successful. Its characteristic is that it can use less manpower to drill blast holes and load explosives at the fastest speed. It can use a small amount of explosives to blast out a large amount of coal seam. It can also make many blast holes explode at the same time, shortening the smoke emission time of the mine pit and increasing the number of daily blasting times, thereby increasing production three times compared to the original. Then, worker Han Baolian invented a fast loading and unloading machine, and production was even higher. Kim Chik-hyon's "multiple continuous blasting" mining method is now being used in many mines in Korea. For this, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the title of "Republic Labor Hero" and awarded him the First Class National Flag Medal and the Gold Star Medal.

    During the difficult war years, Kim Chik-hyon's heroic labor and his creation powerfully supported the victory of the war, and now it is powerfully supporting the restoration of the national economy after the war. When people mention the great significance of his creation, he always humbly says: "It's nothing! This is what should be done to win the freedom and independence of the motherland! As for my creation, it is also inseparable from the great internationalist assistance of the Chinese people. In 1952, American imperialism bombed the Shuifeng Power Plant. When our mine lost power, China sent us electricity. When we lacked food rations, China sent us food. These aids were truly an immeasurable encouragement to our miners and myself." In his words, he was filled with the pure and noble patriotism and internationalism of the proletariat. (Attached picture)

    英雄的劳动，巨大的创造
    ——访朝鲜民主主义人民共和国劳动英雄金直铉
    连云山
    在朝鲜人民访华代表团里，我访问了来自咸镜北道阿吾地矿山的矿工金直铉，他对自己的历史和战争时期英勇劳动的谦逊的叙述，使我受到了强烈的感动。他的思想和事迹，突出地显示出朝鲜工人阶级善良、朴实、勤劳、勇敢的优秀品质。
    金直铉今年三十五岁了，当他出生的时候，他的祖国正在日本帝国主义的统治下，他们度着殖民地人民的痛苦岁月，幼年的金直铉就生活在终年劳动但却不得温饱的家庭里。十四岁，他就跑到阿吾地矿山去做矿工，但矿山是野蛮的日本帝国主义者的，在这里他付出了更繁重的劳动，但所得的仍是不能一饱，仍然过着奴隶似的悲惨生活，一九三八年“张鼓峰”事件时，矿山工人在苏联红军的胜利影响下，不堪忍受牛马般的待遇，曾经作过一次暴动，但暴动被野蛮的日本帝国主义者镇压下去了，金直铉和其他矿工一起又回到矿山去忍受着贫穷和屈辱的生活。直到永不能忘怀的“八、一五”，金直铉才结束了殖民地矿工漫长的痛苦岁月，成了国家的主人。
    这时，他深深懂得了自己和共和国和劳动党的血肉相连的关系，于是他积极参加恢复矿山工作，开始了忘我的劳动并且学习文化，这时，金直铉才学会了自己祖国的文字。从一九四七年矿山有计划的生产开始，虽然国家不断提高生产定额，但金直铉也在不断超额完成生产任务，一九四七年他完成百分之一百三十；一九四八年完成百分之一百五十；一九四九年又完成百分之一百零五，为了他这种优异的生产成就，共和国政府奖给他一枚“功劳奖章”。国家给他的崇高荣誉，对他是一种极大的鼓舞，他不能满足已有的成绩，他要争取更大的成就。这时，金直铉白天在矿山劳动，夜晚就钻研苏联开矿的先进经验，他要为祖国灿烂光辉的未来贡献一切。
    可是，没有多久，战争爆发了。金直铉在收音机面前以沉重的心情倾听着英明领袖金日成将军的广播演说“一切为了祖国的自由独立，一切为了前线。”第二天，矿山的大部分工人为争取战争的胜利参军上前线去了，金直铉是个老技术工人，他必须留下来坚持生产支援战争，这时不少工人的家属和妇女来到了矿山代替参军的工人，金直铉感到自己有责任迅速教会妇女们学习开采矿山的技术，他
  （她）们在敌机轰炸和时常停电等种种困难条件下坚持着生产。到一九五二年，因为战争的需要，矿山必须大大增加产量才能供应前线，这时，金直铉开始苦心研究提高产量的方法，他想能不能像打机关枪那样用连续爆破煤层的方法提高产量？他翻阅着一切采矿的技术书籍，他曾经看见日本人用过爆破采煤的方法，但日本人的书上规定只能一次一次地单式爆破，最深只能爆破二公尺，还必须是软质矿体才行，这时金直铉就想：我们必须学习斯达哈诺夫的精神，来一个革命，我要用复式连续爆破。于是，他开始试验钻两个炮眼，同时爆破了，但是第一次并没有同时爆炸，这一炮先爆炸时把另一炮的引线炸断了，因而熄了火，试验失败了，矿山生产部长金基灿（他是专家）视察研究后，认为此法可行，只因金直铉缺乏数学知识没有弄好。第二次的试验成功了，虽然产量是大大增加了，但是花去的人力、时间和炸药较多，接着金直铉又仔细研究，开始了第三次的试验，他从二个炮眼增加到在很大面积的煤层上钻二十二个深浅不同的炮眼使其同时爆炸，直到第四次才完全成功了。它的特点是可以用较少的人力以最快的速度钻好炮眼，装好炸药，可以用少量的炸药，爆炸出大量的煤层，又可以使许多炮眼同时爆炸，缩短了矿坑的出烟时间，增加了每日的放炮次数，从而使生产量比原来提高三倍，接着工人韩宝连又发明了一个快速装运机械，生产量更高了。金直铉的这一“复式连续爆破”的采矿方法，现在朝鲜的许多矿山都在采用着。为此朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会授予他“共和国劳动英雄”的称号，并授予他一级国旗勋章和金星奖章。
    在艰苦的战争时期，金直铉的英勇劳动和他这
  一创造，有力地支援了战争的胜利，现在，又在有力地支援着战后国民经济的恢复。当人们提起他这
  一创造的巨大意义时，他总是谦逊地说：“不算什么！这是为了争取祖国自由独立所应该做的！至于我这一创造，也是和中国人民伟大的国际主义援助分不开的。一九五二年美帝国主义轰炸了水丰发电厂，我们矿山停电的时候，中国给我们送来了电，我们缺乏口粮的时候，中国给我们送来了粮食，这些援助给我们矿山工人和我自己的鼓舞，真是不可估量的。”在他的言谈里，处处洋溢着无产阶级纯朴而高贵的爱国主义和国际主义感情。（附图片）
