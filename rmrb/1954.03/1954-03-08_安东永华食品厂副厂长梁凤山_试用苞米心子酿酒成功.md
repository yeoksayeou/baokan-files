    Liang Fengshan, Deputy Director of Andong Yonghua Food Factory
    Successfully Brews Liquor Using Corn Cobs
    Corn cobs, which are not edible, can be used to brew liquor. This has been successfully tested by Liang Fengshan, deputy director of the state-owned Andong Yonghua Food Factory in Northeast China. The quality of this liquor is no less than that made from grain and bran.
    Since 1950, when the brewing industry in Northeast China began using sorghum bran to brew liquor, the country has saved a lot of grain. However, due to the rapid development of household livestock farming in rural areas, the supply of sorghum bran can no longer meet the needs of the brewing industry. To this end, the Northeast Local Industry Bureau instructed various factories to find other substitutes for brewing. Liang Fengshan, deputy director of Yonghua Food Factory, began studying the use of corn cobs for brewing at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. He dried more than ten kilograms of corn cobs, ground them into powder, and fermented them. The experimental results proved that corn cobs can be used for brewing. In mid-January, the factory ground 963 kilograms of corn cobs into powder as a raw material for brewing. The first fermentation produced 138.6 jin of liquor, with an average alcohol content of 46.2 degrees, and the highest reaching 71 degrees. The second fermentation produced another 190 jin of liquor. The two fermentations yielded a total of more than 328 jin of liquor.
    Corn cobs are inedible and can be obtained in large quantities from rural areas. If they are used to brew liquor, sorghum bran can be saved to feed livestock.

    安东永华食品厂副厂长梁凤山
    试用苞米心子酿酒成功
    不能食用的苞米心子可以用来酿酒，已经由东北地方国营安东永华食品厂副厂长梁凤山试验成功。这种酒的质量并不次于用粮食和糠做的酒。
    东北区酿酒工业从一九五零年开始用高粱糠酿酒以来，为国家节省了很多粮食。但目前由于农村家畜副业的迅速发展，高粱糠的供应已不能满足酿酒业的需要，为此，东北地方工业局曾指示各厂设法用其他代用品酿酒。永华食品厂副厂长梁凤山在去年第四季度末就开始研究用苞米心子酿酒。他把十多斤苞米心子弄干燥后，磨成粉，并使它发酵，试验结果证明苞米心子可以酿酒。一月中旬，该厂又把九百六十三斤苞米心子磨成粉，作为酿酒的原料。第一次发酵出了一百三十八斤六两酒，酒的度数平均是四十六点二度，最高的达七十一度。第二次发酵又出了一百九十斤酒。两次共出了三百二十八斤多酒。
    苞米心子不能吃，可以从农村大量取得。如果用它来酿酒，就可以省出高粱糠来喂养家畜。
