Xinhua News Agency report:

    The three groups of the Korean People's Delegation Art Troupe, on the evening of the 18th, held grand performances at the Tianqiao Grand Theater, Beijing Theater, and Youth Palace in the capital, performing wonderful musical and dance programs for more than 3,000 workers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, families of Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyrs, and military dependents in the capital.
    The Korean People's Army Concert Troupe performed for 1,700 Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers at the Tianqiao Grand Theater, singing choruses of "Ode to Stalin," "The East is Red," "Song of General Kim Il-sung," "March of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," "March of the Korean People's Army," and the songs and dances "We Have Triumphed," "Peace and Friendship," and more. After each program, the soldiers applauded for a long time.
    The performance of the Korean National Art Theater at the Beijing Theater was held to comfort the families of Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyrs and military dependents. The audience, who had sent their children and relatives to Korea to resist American imperialist aggression together with the fraternal Korean people, felt particularly close to the Korean artists' consolation performance. The actors performed Korean programs such as the song "Korea is Fighting" and the dance "Rose," and also sang Soviet folk songs and Chinese songs.
    At the Youth Palace, watching the performance of the Korean National Classical Art Theater, were worker representatives from more than 20 factories and mines, including the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, as well as staff from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions. Korean artists performed thirteen programs representing the excellent national art traditions of Korea. The performers included the Korean National Meritorious Actors Lin Su-hyang, An Ki-ok, Ding Nan-hee, and others. The programs included several excerpts from the famous Korean folk tale "Chunhyangjeon," the classical dance "Aristocrat and Groom" satirizing the decadence of the feudal class, the song and dance "Farmers' Song" depicting farmers' lives, and the performance of the national musical instrument Gayageum, etc.
