Heilongjiang Province Mobilizes Farmers to Further Improve Spring Plowing Preparations
    Popularizes Guo Houqi's High-Yield Experience to Strive for More Grain

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized cadres throughout the province to lead farmers in further improving spring plowing preparations, universally promoting Guo Houqi's high-yield experience, and striving to increase grain production by five dou per hectare.

Since the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on doing a good job in spring plowing preparations in mid-February, all counties in the province have conveyed and deployed them through Party and mass meetings, and have successively organized more than 3,200 cadres to go to the countryside to inspect and promote spring plowing work. It is understood that more than 2,500 new agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established throughout the province, nearly tripling the number of existing cooperatives last year. The rectification of mutual aid teams was also carried out earlier. More than 71,000 of the more than 76,000 mutual aid teams in 27 counties such as Anda have been finalized, and more than 21,000 teams have formulated production plans. In terms of means of production, more than 20,000 heads of cattle and horses have been exchanged in various villages, and more than 400,000 pieces of plows, cart axles, hoes, and picks have been purchased. A considerable amount of fertilizer and pesticides have also been prepared. At the same time, mass technical appraisal work has been carried out in some areas, summarizing local high-yield experiences. At the same time, some areas have problems with insufficient manure and farmers are not very enthusiastic about increasing production.

In order to promote the further improvement of spring plowing by farmers throughout the province, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of county party secretaries and county party office directors, requesting all counties to seize the gaps to rectify mutual aid teams, and universally train mutual aid team leaders once, with districts or several villages as units. During the spring plowing preparation period, conduct a technical appraisal work with leadership, and through summing up experience, mobilize farmers to improve technology and increase farmers' production enthusiasm, so as to lay the foundation for promoting Guo Houqi's high-yield experience this year. It is also required that all localities further organize cadres to go to the countryside to promote spring plowing and sowing, and strengthen leadership and support for some weak villages, low-level groups, and a small number of farmers with production difficulties, so as to ensure the completion of the province's task of increasing grain production by 5.3 million tons.

    黑龙江省发动农民进一步做好备耕工作
    普遍推行郭后旗丰产经验争取多打粮食
    中共黑龙江省委动员全省干部，领导农民进一步做好备耕工作，普遍推行郭后旗丰产经验，争取每垧地多打五斗粮食。
    自从中共黑龙江省委在二月中旬发出做好备耕工作的指示以后，该省各县都通过党的和群众的会议进行了传达、布置，并先后组织了三千二百多名干部下乡检查、推动备耕工作。据了解：全省已新建立了二千五百多个农业生产合作社，比去年原有社数增加近三倍，对互助组的整顿也较早，安达等二十七个县的七万六千多个互助组中有七万一千多个已经定型，并有二万一千多个组制订了生产计划；生产资料方面，各村交换的牛马有两万多头，买进铧子、车辕、铣、镐等共四十多万件，肥料和农药也准备了不少；部分地区还进行了群众性的技术鉴评工作，总结了当地的丰产经验。同时也有部分地区存在粪肥不足，农民增产劲头不大的现象。
    中共黑龙江省委为了推动全省农民进一步搞好备耕工作，不久前又召开了全省县委书记和县委办公室主任会议，要求各县抓紧空隙整顿互助组，以区或几个村为单位，普遍集训一次互助组长；在备耕时期，有领导地进行一次技术鉴评工作，通过总结经验，发动农民改进技术，提高农民生产热情，为今年推广郭后旗丰产经验打下基础。并要求各地进一步组织干部下乡，推动春耕播种，对部分薄弱村、低级组和少数生产上有困难的农户，更要加强领导和支持，以保证完成全省五百三十万吨粮食的增产任务。（于喜滨、连仲祥）
