    Vigilantly Guard the Frontiers of the Motherland
    Feng Zhaoyi

    It was early summer of 1953, and the weather was already hot. The scenery of the South was beautiful, with lush banana leaves trembling in the quiet gardens.

    Guo Tingxin, the deputy squad leader of a certain public security force, was leading several purchasing agents, braving the heat, carrying vegetables from a certain place on the southern border of Guangxi Province back to their garrison.

    "Comrade Deputy Squad Leader, let's rest at the small porridge shop ahead, I'm very thirsty!" the short soldier following closely behind Guo Tingxin requested.

    Guo Tingxin looked at the sweat-soaked soldier and replied, "Alright!"

    So they stopped in front of the small porridge shop. Guo Tingxin sat down, wiped his sweat, and looked at the expanse of green rice paddies before him.

    The small porridge shop became lively: one asked how much tea cost per cup, another asked how much porridge cost per bowl.

    "Comrades, you've worked hard, drink as you please, don't worry about the money." The bearded owner said as he walked towards them with two bowls of porridge.

    "No, no, we won't drink," the soldiers shook their heads and backed away.

    At this moment, Guo Tingxin noticed a person wearing gray clothes, about thirty years old, carrying a bundle and an umbrella. He had a pen in his pocket, and something inside the pocket made it bulge tightly. He was asking a fellow villager about the price of watches in Guangxi dialect.

    Why is he asking about the price of watches? Could he be...? Guo Tingxin was a skilled investigator, and he placed a question mark on this person in his mind.

    How can this mystery be uncovered? Guo Tingxin took the opportunity to borrow a light for a cigarette, sat next to the man, and started chatting with him.

    "Fellow countryman, where are you going?" he asked.

    "I went to Naliang last week to do business, and I just returned from there today, preparing to go back to Qinzhou. I am from Qinzhou," the man replied with a Mandarin accent.

    As soon as Guo Tingxin heard the words "Naliang," he immediately paid attention, because Naliang was a town close to the Vietnamese border. He considered every word the other person said and continued to chat with him casually: "What good business are you doing?"

    "Cinnamon, star anise."

    "Are you saying cinnamon, star anise?"

    "Yes."

    "Fellow countryman, you're mistaken. Naliang is where cinnamon and star anise are produced, while Qinzhou is the distribution center for cinnamon and star anise," Guo Tingxin expressed his doubt.

    "No, it's not like that at all, you don't understand," the other person replied slowly. "I have a batch of cinnamon and star anise in Qinzhou that I entrusted to someone to sell on consignment. A few days ago, they wrote to me saying that the goods have been sold out and asked me to come and collect the money. Here is a letter, take a look." He even took out a letter.

    Guo Tingxin took it and read it once. The letter said: "Brother ××: Local products sold out, hope you come to collect the money. ××." It was unusually brief, like a telegram. This aroused even more suspicion among the soldiers.

    "So, you're going to Qinzhou to collect the money. Then, why did you say: 'I went to Naliang last week to do business, and I just returned from there today, now preparing to go back to Qinzhou'?" Guo Tingxin retorted in a relaxed tone.

    "Some time ago, I heard that a lot of cinnamon and star anise in Qinzhou were moldy and no one wanted them because no one was taking care of them; now, they say the goods have been completely sold out. The market is unpredictable… It's getting late, I have to hurry on my way. Boss, here's the money for the porridge." The other person took out a 10,000 yuan note from a large stack of Renminbi and threw it on the table, picked up his bundle and umbrella, and prepared to leave.

    "Wait a minute, are you crazy, two bowls of porridge aren't worth 10,000 yuan, let me get you change." The owner went inside to get change.

    After a while, the owner came out of the house with the change. The other person quickly stepped forward, seemingly eager to avoid Guo Tingxin.

    The soldiers became even more suspicious of this person and began to check him. But after searching for a long time, they only found 3.9 million yuan in Renminbi, a few sets of ordinary clothes, and a "certificate" in the bundle. Guo Tingxin thought anxiously: What's going on?

    Finally, when Comrade Guo Tingxin pulled out the black pen from the man's pocket, the man turned pale with fright. Guo Tingxin unscrewed the pen and saw a chemical powder hidden inside the rubber tube.

    "What is this for?"

    "..." The other person did not answer.

    The man revealed his ugly true colors, trembling and silent. Everything became clear: the man in gray was a spy.

    警惕地守卫祖国的边疆
    冯肇彝
    那是一九五三年的初夏，天气已经很热了。南国的风景是美丽的，肥茂的香蕉树叶在沉静的园地里颤动着。
    某公安部队的副班长郭廷信同志正带领几个采买员，冒着炎热，挑着菜由广西省南部边境某地返回驻地来。
    “副班长同志，在前面小粥铺歇歇吧，我口渴得很啦！”紧跟在郭廷信同志后面的那个矮个子的战士请求说。
    郭廷信看着这个满身是汗水的战士回答道：“好吧！”
    于是他们在小粥铺门口停了下来。郭廷信坐下来擦了擦汗，望着眼前一片油绿的稻田。
    小粥铺热闹起来了：这个问茶多少钱一杯，那个问粥多少钱一碗。
    “同志们，辛苦了，随便喝吧，什么钱不钱的。”长着胡子的老板说完就端着两碗稀饭向他们走来。
    “不喝，不喝。”战士们摇着头向后退开来。
    这时，郭廷信发现一个身穿灰色衣服，年约三十岁左右的人，他带着一个包袱和一把雨伞；衣袋上插着一支钢笔，袋里不知放着什么，鼓得紧紧的。他用广西话问旁边一个老乡关于手表的行情。
    他干吗问手表的行情？他莫非是……郭廷信是一个善于侦察的人，他在心中对这个人划了问号。
    怎么才能揭破这个谜呢？郭廷信借借火抽烟的机会，坐到那人的身边，和他聊起天来。
   “老乡，到那里去呀？”他问。
    “上星期到那良做生意，今天刚从那里返回来，准备回钦州去。我是钦州的。”那人用普通口音回答了他。
    郭廷信一听到“那良”两个字，立刻注意起来了，因为那良是一个接近越南边境的市镇。他考虑着对方的每一句话，继续和他闲扯下去：“做什么好生意呀？”
     “桂皮，八角茴。”
   “你是说桂皮，八角茴吗？”
      “是的。”
    “老乡，你弄错了吧。那良附近是出产桂皮、八角茴的，而钦州是桂皮、八角茴的集散地。”郭廷信表示怀疑。
    “不，完全不是这样，你还没有明白。”对方迟缓地回答道，“我有一批桂皮、八角茴放在钦州托人代销，前几天他们来信说货已经销完，要我去拿钱。这里有一封信，你看一看吧。”说完还掏出一封信来。
    郭廷信接过来读了一遍，信上说：“××兄：土产销完，希前来取款。××。”它是异乎寻常的简短，像一封电报一样。这更引起了战士们的怀疑。
    “这样说来，你是去钦州拿钱的了。那么，你为什么说：上星期到那良做生意，今天刚从那里返回来，现在准备回钦州去？”郭廷信用一种轻松的口吻反问着。
    “前些日子听说因没人保管，在钦州的桂皮、八角茴霉坏了很多，没人要；现在，又说货已完全销掉。行情是变化莫测的。……不早了，我还得赶路呢。老板，给你的稀饭钱。”对方从一大叠人民币中抽出一张万元的票子扔在桌上，拿起包袱、雨伞准备往外走。
      “慢一点，你莫非发疯了，两碗稀饭不值一万元，让我找钱给你。”老板到屋里拿零钱去了。
    不一会老板拿着零钱走出屋来。对方赶快迎上前去，似乎急于要避开郭廷信。
    战士们对这个人更怀疑了，便开始检查了。可是搜了半天，只发现包袱里的人民币三百九十万元，几套普通衣服和一张“证明书”。郭廷信焦急地想着：这是怎么回事呢？
    最后当郭廷信同志从那人的口袋中抽出那枝黑色的钢笔时，那人吓得脸色灰白。郭廷信拧开钢笔一看，皮管内藏着一种化学粉末。
      “这是干什么的？”
      “……”对方没有回答。
    那人露出了丑恶的原形，哆嗦着，不作声。一切事情都明白了：那穿灰衣的是一个特务。
