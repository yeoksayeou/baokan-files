The Korean People's Delegation Art Troupe has already given several performances in Beijing, and the outstanding artists of the Korean people will continue their performances tirelessly throughout our country. We believe that their introduction of Korean classical and modern music and dance, through their excellent performances, will help the Chinese people further understand the heroic Korean people, and further strengthen the great, militant, and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

The art workers of our capital city, with excitement, have admired the music and dance art of the Korean people with great interest. The achievements of the Korean people in developing the traditions of national art and praising the heroic struggles of the people in the heat of the struggle to defend their motherland have given our art workers a very deep impression and should be taken as a model for us to learn from. Korean composers and dancers, starting from the long-standing artistic traditions of their own nation, have learned from the advanced experiences of socialist art construction, armed themselves with high skills, and profoundly reflected the spirit of the heroic struggle and the life of hard work of the great Korean people.

The first performance of the Korean People's Delegation Art Troupe in Beijing was a joint performance by the Korean People's Army Ensemble, the National Art Theater, and the National Classical Art Theater. The militant songs of the People's Army Ensemble, the moving dances and orchestral music of the National Art Theater, and the simple classical song and dance performances of the National Classical Art Theater, starting from different perspectives and performing in different styles, all reached a common goal: to praise the struggle and life of the heroic Korean people, to promote the long and great artistic traditions of the Korean people, and thereby to enrich the splendid art treasury of progressive humanity in the world.

The choir of the Korean People's Army Ensemble has excellent training, with contrasting and balanced voices in each part, and the singing is full and effective. "Song of Recovery," with lyrics by Park Heng Cheol and music by Choi Yeon, uses novel and moving musical language to depict a moving musical image. In peacetime, the Korean people are engaged in the country's recovery and construction with a selfless spirit, with the same enthusiasm as they carried shells during the war. This song has the characteristics of the distinct traditional Korean music language, and the successful performance of the Ensemble's choir made it even more prominent and clearly expressed.

The beautiful dance "Rose" performed by the National Art Theater, with rose-red and emerald-green dresses, created an extremely moving stage image. The rose flower is unyielding in the wind and rain, and is a symbol of the noble character of the fighting Korean women. This dance successfully expresses this traditional theme with new significance using the unique movements of Korean national dance.

"Farmer's Song" depicts an ancient custom passed down from 1,300 years ago, where people sing and dance before transplanting rice seedlings. Through the excellent performances of Ding Nanxi and Lin Suxiang, meritorious actors of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, this ancient song and dance is given a new look and new meaning, expressing the people's expectations and joy for the harvest of their labor, and their love for labor and creation.

The male voice quartet of the Korean People's Army Ensemble is also extremely successful. "Song of the Automobile Driver," with lyrics by Shen Feng Yuan and music by Zheng Zhenyu, intimately depicts the fighting life of the heroic soldiers, describes the revolutionary optimism of the automobile drivers, and expresses the heroic spirit of laughing off any difficulties.

The a cappella chorus "Song of Construction" (lyrics by Zhao Lingchu, music by Li Mianxiang) performed by the National Art Theater is a successful example of the creation of new national-style musical language. The choir of the National Art Theater movingly sang the lines: "In the city, in that village, build a magnificent triumphal arch to welcome the warriors of this land," praising the noble qualities of optimism and self-confidence of the Korean people.

We greatly appreciated the Korean folk music programs such as the Korean zither (Gayageum) solo and the ensemble of national musical instruments, as well as the song and dance "Peace and Friendship" which describes the friendship and unity of the peaceful, democratic, socialist camp and the progressive people of the world, and the "Welcoming Spring Dance" which praises the joy of spring. In particular, the dance "Xinjiang Girl," which depicts the life of working women in our country, gave us an extremely intimate feeling.

The female chorus "By the Spring" (lyrics by Choi Rosa, music by Yoon Seung Jin) depicts the touching feelings of young Korean women. The perfect performance also painted a moving scene: a girl goes to the spring to fetch water and sees a soldier washing clothes; she quietly glances at him, he is really not good at washing clothes; she asks shyly, "Can I wash it for you?"

The National Art Theater Orchestra successfully performed "Towards Victory" composed by Li Zhengyan; Cao Jing's solo "Song of Qingjin Port" and Wu Meixun's solo "Russia" also demonstrated a high level of skill. Especially when the audience requested an encore, the small choir and soloists sang works by our country's composers in Chinese, which fully demonstrated the friendship between the people and art workers of China and Korea.

"Ballad of Eagle Peak Mountain" (lyrics by Park Heng Cheol, music by Liu Zhongzhe), played with the Korean zither (Gayageum) accompanying the singing, is the voice from the bottom of the hearts of the Korean people. This song uses the style of ancient narrative epics and the form of Korean folk music to praise the deeds of the Korean and Chinese heroes guarding the "1211" high ground: "Spreading their wings in the sky, is it called Eagle Peak? Young people of the two countries guard these peaks!" The heroes of Eagle Peak Mountain defended the independence and freedom of the Korean people, but it was precisely these heroes' heroic struggles that gave our country great help; the outstanding sons and daughters of China and Korea fought side by side, which also guaranteed the safety of our country and made outstanding contributions to world peace. The author of "Ballad of Eagle Peak Mountain" used a national ode to praise these heroes, truly expressing this national feeling.

The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged in blood will last forever! (Attached picture)

    欢迎朝鲜人民的艺术家们
    赵　沨
    朝鲜人民访华代表团艺术团已在北京举行了多次演出，优秀的朝鲜人民的艺术家们并将不辞劳苦地在我国各地继续进行表演。我们相信，他们介绍的朝鲜人民古典的和现代的音乐、舞蹈艺术，通过他们的卓越的表演，一定会帮助中国人民更进一步对英雄的朝鲜人民的了解，并更进一步加强中朝两国人民伟大的、战斗的、万世不渝的友谊。
    我国首都的艺术工作者怀着兴奋的心情，以极大的兴趣欣赏了朝鲜人民的音乐、舞蹈艺术，朝鲜人民在保卫自己祖国的火热斗争中所进行的发扬民族艺术传统和歌颂人民英勇斗争的艺术创造上的成就，给予我国艺术工作者以极深刻的印象，并应作为我们学习的模范。朝鲜的作曲家和舞蹈家，从自己民族悠久的艺术传统出发，学习了先进的社会主义艺术建设的经验，武装着高度的技巧，深刻地反映了伟大朝鲜人民的英勇斗争的精神和辛勤劳动的生活。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团艺术团在北京的第一次演出，是由朝鲜人民军协奏团、国立艺术剧场和国立古典艺术剧场联合演出的。人民军协奏团的战斗的歌声，国立艺术剧场的动人的舞蹈和管弦乐，国立古典艺术剧场朴素的古典歌舞的表演，从不同的角度出发，用不同的风格演出，但殊途同归地达到了一个共同的目的，那便是歌颂了英勇朝鲜人民的斗争和生活，发扬了朝鲜人民悠久而伟大的艺术传统，也从而丰富了世界进步人类的灿烂的艺术宝库。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的合唱团有着极优异的训练，各个声部对比而平衡，歌声充实而富效果。朴恒澈作词、崔连作曲的“恢复之歌”，用新颖、动听的音乐语言刻划出了动人的音乐形象。朝鲜人民在和平时间，怀着像战争中搬运炮弹般的情绪，忘我地从事于国家的恢复建设。这首歌曲具有着鲜明的朝鲜人民传统音乐语言的特点，协奏团合唱团成功的表演，更使之突出而鲜明地表现了出来。
    国立艺术剧场演出的美丽的舞蹈“蔷薇”，玫瑰红和翠绿的衣裙造成了极其动人的舞台形象，蔷薇花在风雨中坚贞不屈，是战斗的朝鲜妇女的崇高性格的象征，这个舞蹈用朝鲜民族舞蹈特有的动作，成功地表现了这一具有新的意义的传统的主题。
    “农民歌”，描写了一千三百年前传下的古老的风俗，人们在插秧前载歌载舞，通过朝鲜民主主义人民共和国功勋演员丁南希、林素香的优秀的演出，更赋予这古老的歌舞以新的风貌和新的意义，表现了人民对自己劳动收获的期待和喜悦，对劳动和创造的热爱。
    朝鲜人民军协奏团的男声小合唱也极为成功，沈奉元作词、郑振玉作曲的“汽车司机歌”，亲切地描写了英雄战士们的战斗生活，描写了汽车司机们的革命乐观主义精神，表现了那种对任何艰难一笑置之的英雄气概。
    国立艺术剧场的无伴奏合唱“建设之歌”（赵灵出作词、李冕相作曲），是新的民族风格的音乐语言创造上的成功的范例，国立艺术剧场的合唱团动人地唱出了：“在城市中，在那乡村里，建立起华丽的凯旋门，将迎接这土地的勇士们”的诗句，歌颂了朝鲜人民乐观自信的高贵品质。
    我们以极大的兴趣欣赏了朝鲜古琴（伽倻琴）的独奏和民族器乐合奏等朝鲜民族音乐节目，以及描写和平、民主、社会主义阵营和世界进步人类友好团结的歌舞“和平与友谊”，歌颂春天的欢愉的“迎春舞”等，特别是描写我国劳动妇女生活的舞蹈“新疆姑娘”，更给我们以极亲切的感觉。
    女声合唱“在泉边上”（崔露沙作词、尹升镇作曲），描写了朝鲜青年妇女的感人的心情，完美的表演也画出了一幅动人的情景：姑娘到泉边打水，看见一个战士在洗衣服；她悄悄地看他一下，洗衣服，他真不在行；就含着羞轻轻地问：“我替你来洗，行么？”
    国立艺术剧场管弦乐队成功地演奏了李桢彦作曲的“向着胜利”；曹敬独唱的“清津浦船歌”和吴梅薰独唱的“俄罗斯”也表现了高度的技巧。特别在观众要求再唱一个的时候，小合唱团和独唱家们却用中文唱了我国作曲家的作品，这充分表现了中朝两国人民以及中朝艺术工作者间的友谊。
    用朝鲜古琴（伽倻琴）演奏、伴和着歌唱的“鹰峰山谣”（朴恒澈作词、柳钟哲作曲），是朝鲜人民心底的声音，这首歌曲用古代叙事史诗的风格，用朝鲜民族乐曲的形式，讴歌了守卫在“一二一一”高地的朝中英雄们的事迹：“苍天中伸长着翅膀儿，叫鹰峰么？两国青年们守卫这些山峰！”鹰峰山的英雄们保卫了朝鲜人民的独立与自由，但也正是这些英雄们的英勇斗争，给予了我们祖国以极大的帮助；中朝两国的优秀儿女们并肩作战，也保障了我们祖国的安全，并且对世界和平作了卓越的贡献。“鹰峰山谣”的作者，用民族的颂歌来赞美这些英雄，真实地表现了这种全民的感情。
    鲜血结成的中朝人民的友谊万世不渝！（附图片）
