Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 4th: Representatives from the General Delegation and the First General Sub-Delegation (Korean War Volunteers), the Fourth General Sub-Delegation, and its affiliated Second Sub-Delegation of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, visited all the sailors of a certain fleet of the People's Navy on the 3rd, who bravely defend the motherland's seas.

　　To welcome the representatives sent by the people of the whole country, all the commanders and fighters of a certain fleet of the Navy were busy pasting welcome slogans and hanging huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the warships on the evening of the 2nd. The soldiers also published a wall newspaper entitled "Welcoming Relatives" on the ship. On the 3rd, the warships were solemnly decorated with full flags. When the representatives of the delegation, led by Deputy Head Huang Songling, and the performers of the cultural troupe stepped onto the deck, the sailors applauded enthusiastically and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Thank you to the people of the whole country for your care and support!" Deputy Head Huang Songling shook hands with the sailors one by one and kept asking, "How are you, comrades!" Then, the representatives and performers of the delegation began their activities on the ship. Some warmly shook hands and embraced the sailors, while others exchanged signatures and gifts. Xu Jinsheng, a first-class meritorious volunteer soldier and representative of the delegation, gave a gold star pen engraved with "Victory Commemoration of Resisting America and Aiding Korea" to Xiao Zhendong, a first-class meritorious sailor of the Navy. Xiao Zhendong solemnly gave Xu Jinsheng a commemorative medal. Cao Xubao, a model agricultural laborer from Shandong Province and representative of the delegation, was surrounded by a group of young sailors on the deck. Old Man Cao's shoulders and arms were covered with the sailors' hands, and Old Man Cao held several sailors' hands in his own. The sailors listened with great interest to Old Man Cao talk about the new atmosphere in the countryside. The performers of the Korean War Volunteer Army's cultural troupe braved the bitter wind to give a wonderful performance for the sailors. Famous Peking opera actor Qiu Shengrong sang Peking opera programs such as "Mu Hu Guan" for the sailors.

　　After the delegation representatives finished their visit, they also took photos with the heroic sailors on the ship as a souvenir. The delegation representatives also wrote inscriptions for a certain ship as a memento. The inscription by Deputy Head Huang Songling was: "Build a strong navy and defend the motherland's coastal defense." A certain naval unit presented two models of naval vessels to the delegation.

    慰问团代表慰问人民海军某舰队全体水兵
    【新华社南京四日电】全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团总团、第一总分团（志愿军）、第四总分团和所属第二分团的代表，在三日慰问了英勇地保卫着祖国海洋的人民海军某舰队全体水兵。
    某舰队的全体指挥员、战斗员为了迎接全国人民派来的代表，二日晚上就忙着在兵舰上贴欢迎标语，挂毛主席和朱总司令的巨幅像片。战士们还在舰上出版了一期“迎接亲人”的墙报。三日，军舰上隆重地挂了满旗。当以副总团长黄松龄为首的慰问团代表和文工团的演员们踏上甲板时，水兵们热烈地鼓着掌，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“感谢全国人民对我们的关怀和支援！”副总团长黄松龄和水兵一一握手，不住地问：“同志好！”接着，慰问团的代表和演员们就在舰上展开慰问活动。有的和水兵们热烈地握手拥抱，有的相互签名和赠送礼品。慰问团代表、志愿军一等功臣徐金生把一枝刻着“抗美援朝胜利纪念”的金星钢笔送给了海军一等功臣萧振东，萧振东慎重地送给徐金生一枚纪念章。慰问团代表、山东省农业劳动模范曹绪保在甲板上被一群年轻的水兵围住了，曹老大爷的肩上，臂上尽是水兵的手，曹老大爷的两只手里还握着好几个水兵的手。水兵们兴致勃勃地听曹老大爷讲农村新气象。志愿军文工团的演员们冒着凛冽的大风为水兵作了精彩的演出。京剧名演员裘盛戎为水兵演唱了“牧虎关”等京剧节目。
    慰问团代表们慰问完毕后，还在舰上和英勇的水兵摄影留念。慰问团代表并给某舰题词纪念。副总团长黄松龄的题词是：“建设强大的海军，保卫祖国的海防”。海军某部队向慰问团献了两具海军舰艇的模型。
