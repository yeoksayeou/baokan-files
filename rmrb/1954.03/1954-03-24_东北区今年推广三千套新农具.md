    The Northeast Region will further promote 3,000 sets of new-style animal-drawn farm tools this year. Based on the experience of promoting new farm tools in recent years, Songjiang Province has identified Ji’an, Fujin, Huachuan, Huanan, Baoqing, Ning’an, and Shuangcheng nine counties as key promotion areas, and will continue to promote them on a large scale; other counties will continue to leverage the effectiveness of existing new farm tools and distribute some appropriately. Liaodong Province has determined three promotion methods: first, small farm tools are directly loaned to farmers for use, and large farm tools are loaned to promotion stations for renting to farmers; second, complete sets are loaned to farmers for use, or complete sets are rented to farmers; third, the complete set of farm tools is divided into two parts, one part is rented to farmers, and one part is loaned to farmers.
    Since last autumn, various regions have generally repaired the existing new farm tools while promoting new ones. Heilongjiang Province completed this work at the end of December last year. In forty days, a total of 594 sets of new farm tools were inspected and repaired, accounting for 45% of the province's original new farm tools.
    Since 1950, when new-style animal-drawn farm tools were first tested, 4,605 sets (excluding single-piece promotions of plows, shovels, and cultivators, etc.) had been promoted throughout the region by 1953. In recent years, due to the use of new farm tools to reform cultivation methods, the increase in yield per unit area has been significant. Although there were disasters such as drought, floods, insects, and frost in 1953, the land cultivated with new farm tools in the region still produced 500 to 1,000 catties more grain per hectare than the land cultivated with old farm tools. The promotion and use of new-style farm tools have also played a significant role in consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation organizations and promoting the forward development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. When the Bao’an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jixian County was still a mutual aid team in 1951, each seeder could only sow three hectares of land per day because the land was scattered. After the establishment of the production cooperative in 1952, the average daily sowing area per seeder increased to 4.75 hectares. Because the use of new farm tools saved labor and produced more grain, more than 40 households in the entire village joined the Bao'an Agricultural Production Cooperative. The use of new farm tools has also created favorable conditions for women to participate in agricultural production, and promoted farmers to actively learn technology. According to statistics from 332 agricultural technology promotion stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong provinces alone, 22,892 farmer technicians were trained in 1953 alone, most of whom can use new farm tools, and some can even perform simple repairs on new farm tools.

### 东北区今年推广三千套新农具

    东北区今年推广三千套新农具
    东北区今年将再推广三千套新式马拉农具。根据几年来推广新农具的经验，松江省已确定集贤、富锦、桦川、桦南、宝清、宁安、双城等九县为重点推广区，继续大量推广；其它县份则继续发挥原有新农具的效能，适当地发放一些。辽东省已确定三种推广办法：一、小件农具直接贷给农民使用，大件的贷给推广站租给农民使用；二、全套贷给农民使用，或是全套租给农民使用；三、把全套农具分成两部分，一部分租给农民，一部分贷给农民使用。
    去年秋季以来，各地在推广新农具的同时，对原有的新农具曾普遍修理了一次，黑龙江省已于去年十二月底结束这一工作，四十天内共检修了五百九十四套新农具，占全省原有新农具的百分之四十五。
    自一九五零年重点试用新式马拉农具以来，到一九五三年全区已推广了四千六百零五套（不包括单件推广的犁及铲趟机等）。几年来，由于使用新农具改革了耕作方法，单位面积产量的提高是显著的。一九五三年虽有旱、涝、虫、霜等灾害，但全区使用新农具耕种的土地仍较用旧农具耕种的土地每垧增产五百斤到一千斤粮食。新式农具的推广使用，对于巩固提高互助合作组织，推动互助合作运动的向前发展也起到了很大作用。集贤县保安农业生产合作社在一九五一年还是互助组的时候，因为土地零散，每台播种机每天只播种三垧地；成立生产合作社后，一九五二年每台播种机平均每天播种面积增加到四垧七亩五分。由于使用新农具省工多打粮，使全屯四十多户农民都加入了保安农业生产合作社。使用新农具也为妇女参加农业生产创造了有利条件。并促使农民积极学习技术。仅据黑龙江、吉林、辽东三个省三百三十二个农业技术推广站的统计，只一九五三年一年就训练了两万二千八百九十二名农民技术手，其中大部分能使用新农具，并有一部分人还能对新农具进行简单的修理。
