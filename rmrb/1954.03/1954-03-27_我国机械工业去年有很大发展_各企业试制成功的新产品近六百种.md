Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: In 1953, China's machine manufacturing industry made great progress. The total output value of state-owned and joint state-private machine manufacturing enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government increased by 65 percent compared with 1952, and about twelve times compared with 1949. Last year, the labor productivity of the machine industry sector also greatly improved. The average value produced by each machine worker in 1953 increased by 30 percent compared with 1952, and 2.9 times compared with 1949. Due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity and the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, China's machine manufacturing enterprises accumulated a large amount of funds for the country last year. If this fund is invested in construction, three large factories with an annual output of 10,000 tons of machines can be built.

    In 1953, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government vigorously carried out the trial production of new products to meet the needs of national construction, which further improved the manufacturing capacity and technical level of China's machine industry. Last year, nearly six hundred new products were successfully trial-produced by enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government. Many heavy and precision machine equipment that could not be manufactured in the past have been manufactured. For example, in terms of mining and heavy machinery, 60 new products were manufactured last year. Among these new products, the large cone crusher is the largest of the Soviet-style crushers. The crusher weighs 61 tons and is 5 meters high. It can crush 500 to 800 tons of ore per hour. Other relatively important new products include short cylinder ball mills that can crush ten different specifications of ore, and highly efficient Soviet-style rock drills, electric winches, 60-ton bottom-dumping trucks, and 120-ton steel ingot mold trucks. The production of these products has a great effect on promoting the development of China's mining and smelting industries. In terms of electrical appliances, a series of product innovation work was carried out in 1953 to reform the old and messy electrical products according to Soviet standard specifications. Last year, 394 new electrical products were successfully trial-produced in addition to temporary orders. Among them, the important products are the 6,000-kilowatt water turbine generator, which is the first largest hydropower generation equipment made in China. The electricity it generates can be used for lighting in a city with a population of 300,000. In addition, there are also large transformers of 20,000 kVA, 44,000 volts and 13,500 kVA, 110,000 volts. These transformers have been supplied to construction departments such as Anshan Iron and Steel. In addition, in the electrical industry, a variety of high-voltage oil circuit breakers for power plants, explosion-proof motors for coal mines, and various electrical instruments, cables, and control equipment were also manufactured last year. In terms of machine tool manufacturing, many large and high-efficiency metal cutting machine tools were also successfully trial-produced last year. For example, the Soviet-style 724 gantry planer can cut castings or forgings weighing up to 10 tons. The Soviet-style 1Д65 lathe can process workpieces with a diameter of 1 meter and a length of 3 meters. In addition, the Soviet-style 255 radial drilling machine, 373 grinding machine, 532 gear hobbing machine, and 1336M hexagonal lathe are also new types of highly efficient machine tools. The production of these new machine tools has further expanded the technical foundation of China's machine manufacturing industry.

    In 1953, the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government took the implementation of operation plans as the central link to strengthen planned management, which significantly improved the management level of enterprises. Last year, about three-quarters of the enterprises in the First Ministry of Machine Building system implemented operation plans. Enterprises that earnestly implemented operation plans generally improved the balance of production and improved production efficiency. For example, after the Tianjin Power Machine Factory implemented the operation plan, the total output value in the last month of the third quarter of last year increased by 108 percent compared with the last month of the first quarter of the same year, and labor productivity increased by 90 percent. In the process of implementing operation plans, many enterprises have created new forms of combining the implementation of operation plans with the development of labor competitions, which combines the labor enthusiasm of the majority of employees with the reform of enterprise management, which has played a great role in implementing operation plans and improving production, and also enriched the content of trade union work. The improvement and improvement of enterprise management have greatly exerted the potential strength of the machine industry, providing favorable conditions for overfulfilling last year's production plan.

    In 1953, the basic construction of China's machine industry also made great progress. Last year, the state's investment in basic construction in the machine industry was equivalent to 241.35 percent of the basic construction investment in 1952. Last year, China began to build the first large-scale automobile manufacturing plant, and also built heavy machinery manufacturing plants, motor manufacturing plants, machine tool manufacturing plants, shipyards, measuring tool and cutting tool plants, pneumatic tool plants, and wire factories at the same time. These large-scale key projects completed 105.32 percent of the annual construction plan last year. Among them, the newly built Harbin Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, Harbin Motor Factory and the rebuilt Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory will be completed or partially put into production this year. Last year, more than 100 enterprises in the First Ministry of Machine Building system were renovated and expanded. After the completion of these engineering constructions, they will play a great role in the construction and development of China's heavy industry.

    我国机械工业去年有很大发展
    各企业试制成功的新产品近六百种
   【新华社二十四日讯】一九五三年，我国机械制造工业有了很大发展。中央人民政府第一机械工业部所属国营、公私合营机械制造企业去年全年的生产总值，比一九五二年增长了百分之六十五；比一九四九年增长了约十二倍。去年，机械工业部门的劳动生产率也大大提高了。每个机械工人一九五三年平均生产的价值，比一九五二年增长了百分之三十；比一九四九年增长了二点九倍。由于劳动生产率的不断提高和开展增产节约运动，去年我国机械制造企业为国家积累了大量资金，如把这笔资金投入建设，可建成三座年产一万吨机器的大工厂。
    一九五三年，中央第一机械工业部为适应国家建设的需要，曾大力进行了新产品试制工作，使我国机械工业的制造能力和技术水平获得了进一步提高。去年中央第一机械工业部所属各企业试制成功的新产品近六百种，许多过去不能制造的重型、精密的机器设备，已经制造出来。如在矿山和重型机械方面，去年制造了六十种新产品。在这些新产品中，大型圆锥破碎机是苏式破碎机中最大的一种，这台破碎机全重六十一吨，机体高五公尺，每小时能破碎五百到八百吨矿石。此外比较重要的新产品，还有能粉碎十种不同规格矿石的短筒球磨机和效率很高的苏式凿岩机、电绞车、六十吨翻底车、一百二十吨钢锭模车等。这些产品的制成，对于促进我国采矿和冶炼工业的发展，都有很大作用。在电器方面，一九五三年进行了一系列的产品革新工作，把陈旧而杂乱的电器产品，按苏联的标准规格进行了改革。去年一年试制成功的电器新产品除临时订货外达三百九十四种。其中重要的产品有六千瓩的水轮发电机，这是我国自制第一台最大的利用水力发电的设备，它发出的电可供三十万人口的城市照明用。另外还有二万千伏安、四万四千伏特和一万三千五百千伏安、十一万伏特的大型变压器，这些变压器，已经供应了钢都鞍山等建设部门。此外，在电器工业方面，去年还制成了供发电站用的多种高压油断路器和供煤矿用的防爆电动机和各种电气仪表、线缆和控制设备。在机床制造方面，去年也试制成功不少大型和高效率的金属切削机床。如苏式七二四型龙门刨床，可切削重达十吨的铸件或锻件。苏式一Д六五车床，可加工直径一公尺、长三公尺的工作物。此外，苏式二五五型摇臂钻床、三七三型磨床、五三二型滚齿机、一三三六M型六角车床等，也都是效能很高的新型工作母机。这些新式机床的制成，进一步扩大了我国机械制造工业的技术基础。
    一九五三年，中央第一机械工业部以推行作业计划作为加强计划管理的中心环节，使企业的管理水平有了显著的提高。去年，第一机械工业部系统，约有四分之三的企业推行了作业计划。凡是认真推行作业计划的企业，一般都提高了生产的均衡性，使生产效率得到了提高。例如天津动力机厂推行作业计划之后，去年第三季度最后一月比同年第一季度最后一月的生产总值增加了百分之一百零八，劳动生产率提高了百分之九十。在推行作业计划中，不少企业更创造了结合推行作业计划开展劳动竞赛的新形式，使广大职工的劳动热情和企业管理的改革工作相结合，对贯彻作业计划和提高生产都起了很大作用，同时还使工会工作有了新的内容。由于企业管理的改进和提高，使机械工业的潜在力量得到很大发挥，给超额完成去年生产计划提供了有利的条件。
    一九五三年，我国机械工业的基本建设也有很大发展。去年国家对机械工业的基本建设投资，相当于一九五二年基本建设投资的百分之二百四十一点三五。去年，我国开始建设第一座规模巨大的汽车制造厂，还在同时建设重型机器制造厂、电机制造厂和机床制造厂、造船厂、量具刃具厂、风动工具厂、电线厂等。这些规模巨大的重点工程，去年完成全年建设计划的百分之一百零五点三二。其中新建哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂、哈尔滨电机厂和改建的沈阳第一机床厂等，都将在今年建成或部分投入生产。去年第一机械工业部系统还有一百多个企业得到改建和扩建。这些工程建设完成后，对于我国重工业的建设和发展将起很大的作用。
