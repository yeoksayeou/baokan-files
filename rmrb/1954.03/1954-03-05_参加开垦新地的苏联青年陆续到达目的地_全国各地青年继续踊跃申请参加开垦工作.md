Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th: Soviet youth volunteering to reclaim virgin and abandoned land in the east have arrived at their destinations. The first group of youth from Moscow to the Altai Krai arrived in Barnaul on February 28th; the second group arrived on March 2nd. The youth from Kyiv also arrived in Kustanai, Kazakh Republic, on February 28th. The first group of pioneers who arrived in the Altai Krai set off for work areas on the 1st. The youth who arrived in Kazakhstan will also depart within days to work at nine Machine Tractor Stations in the reclamation areas.

These young patriots have been warmly welcomed by local Communist Party organizations, government agencies, and Communist Youth League organizations as they passed through various places and arrived at their destinations. When the young pioneers from Moscow arrived in Barnaul, thousands of local working people greeted them at the station and held a welcoming meeting. When the Secretary of the Altai Krai Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Lebedev, delivered a welcoming speech, he pointed out: We are convinced that you young pioneers will love this beautiful border region and the excellent people here. On February 28th, a mass rally to welcome Ukrainian youth was also held at the Kustanai station. These young reclamation workers said at the meeting: No matter the cold or heat on the grassland, no matter any difficulties, they must work with the working people of the Kazakh Republic to reclaim wasteland and strive to obtain high yields on the newly reclaimed land.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 4th: The number of young people across the Soviet Union applying to reclaim virgin and abandoned land in the east and southeast has recently been increasing. As of February 26th, the number of people in Moscow requesting to participate in reclamation had increased to more than 30,000, many of whom are members of the Communist Youth League from factories. After reading the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to all voters, Sergei Zhanov, a worker at the Moscow Coking Gas Plant, convened a family meeting, and the entire family of thirteen decided to go to Kazakhstan to reclaim land. More than 10,000 people in the Kuban region have applied to participate in this work. The Kurgan Oblast in the Ural region will reclaim 300,000 hectares of land. Many young workers from the Ural Agricultural Machinery Factory and the Meat Products United Factory in Kurgan City have applied to reclaim 30,000 hectares of wasteland in the Ustyuzhsky District of the state. In Magnitogorsk, 200 young men and women applied to reclaim land in just one day. The number of people in the Ukrainian Republic who want to participate in reclamation has also greatly increased, with more than 11,000 applications coming from Communist Youth League members alone. At the Mogilev Locomotive Factory in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, 600 young workers have applied to work in the reclamation areas. They wrote in their collectively signed application: It is the duty of our Communist Youth League members to work where the work is most needed. We guarantee that we will not spare our strength in the labor of reclaiming wasteland.

A large number of young people from various places who have successively applied to work in the reclamation areas are about to set off to work in the reclamation areas. On February 28th, 250 young tractor drivers, combine operators, lathe operators, and fitters from the Kuban region departed from Krasnodar to the Altai Krai. 2,600 people in the Kirov Oblast are ready to depart. The Machine Tractor Stations and state farms in the Krasnoyarsk Krai have organized 150 youth tractor teams, which are actively preparing to depart for the reclamation areas.
