The Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee recently held an exhibition in Beijing titled "The Dissemination of Marxist-Leninist Classics in China." The exhibition displayed various books and periodicals of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin published in Chinese since 1900.

The exhibition is divided into two major parts: before and after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The part before the founding of the People's Republic of China is further divided into five sections: before the founding of the Chinese Communist Party (1900 to 1921), the period of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and the First Revolutionary Civil War (1921 to 1927), the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War (1927 to 1937), the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937 to 1945), and the period of the Third Revolutionary Civil War (1945 to 1949). This part displays various translations and versions of Marxist-Leninist classics published in revolutionary base areas and liberated areas, as well as in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during each period, many of which are the only remaining copies and versions of significant historical importance. Particularly valuable are the earliest books and periodicals introducing Marxism published around 1900, books and newspapers published in the Central Revolutionary Base Area after 1927, and underground publications of the Party. This part also uses various pictures and charts to illustrate that "the Chinese have found Marxism-Leninism, the universally applicable truth, and the face of China has changed" (Mao Zedong: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"); illustrating that under the influence of the October Revolution, China experienced the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese Communist Party was founded, the "February 7th" and other workers' revolutionary movements were launched, and under the theoretical guidance of the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, successive revolutionary wars were launched, finally achieving the liberation of all of China.

The second part displays various translations of Marxist-Leninist classics published after the founding of the People's Republic of China. This part uses books, periodicals, and charts to illustrate that after the victory of the Chinese revolution, all strata and nationalities across the country widely read and studied Marxist-Leninist works, schools have Marxist-Leninist courses, and Marxist-Leninist classics occupy an important proportion of books in bookstores and libraries. This part also illustrates the importance attached by the CPC Central Committee to the translation and publication of classical works. This important work has gradually been centralized and unified. In early 1953, the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin was established to engage in the planned and systematic translation of all classical works, which are uniformly published by the People's Publishing House. This part also uses many manuscripts and pictures to illustrate that the translation of classical works is gradually improving, and printing work is being carried out more cautiously and meticulously, and distribution work is being expanded more widely.

The exhibition also uses charts to illustrate how Marxism-Leninism has armed China's various political movements in recent years, gradually realizing socialist ideals in industry, agriculture, and various construction fields.

Various works by Comrade Mao Zedong and his close comrades-in-arms, who combined Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, are also displayed in the exhibition.

The exhibition also displayed many meaningful statistical tables. The statistical tables show that from 1906 to 1949, only 532 kinds of works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin were published. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Publishing House alone has published more than 17 million copies of Marxist-Leninist works, most of which have been published in more than ten editions. "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction" has been published in forty-four editions, and the "Communist Manifesto" and "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" have both been published in thirty-nine editions.

The exhibition is held at No. 20 Xixiejie, Fengsheng Hutong, Xidan, Beijing.

    中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局
    举办马克思列宁主义经典著作展览会
    中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局最近在北京举办“马克思列宁主义经典著作在中国的传播”展览会。展览会陈列了一九○○年以来用中文出版的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的各种书刊。
    展览会分为中华人民共和国成立前和成立后的两大部分。中华人民共和国成立前又分为五个部分：中国共产党成立以前（一九○○年到一九二一年），中国共产党成立和第一次国内革命战争时期（一九二一年到一九二七年），第二次国内革命战争时期（一九二七年到一九三七年），抗日战争时期（一九三七年到一九四五年），第三次国内革命战争时期（一九四五年到一九四九年）。这一部分陈列了各个时期革命根据地和解放区以及国民党统治区所出的马克思列宁主义经典著作的各种译本和版本，其中有许多是仅存的孤本和具有重大历史意义的版本。特别珍贵的是一九○○年前后出版的最早介绍马克思主义的书刊，一九二七年后中央革命根据地出版的书报和党的地下刊物。这一部分并以各种画片、图表，说明“中国人找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，中国的面目就起了变化了”（毛泽东：“论人民民主专政”）；说明中国在十月革命的影响下，发生了“五四”运动，成立了中国共产党，展开了“二七”等工人革命运动，并在马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的理论指导下，展开了历次的革命战争，终于获得了全中国的解放。
    第二部分陈列了中华人民共和国成立以后出版的马克思列宁主义经典著作的各种译本。这一部分用书刊和图表说明中国革命胜利后全国各阶层、各民族广泛阅读和研究马克思列宁主义著作，学校里有了马克思列宁主义的课程，马克思列宁主义经典著作在书店和图书馆的书籍中占着重要的比重。这一部分并说明中共中央对经典著作的翻译和出版的重视。这一重要工作已逐渐集中和统一。一九五三年年初成立了马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局，从事有计划有系统地翻译全部经典著作的工作，由人民出版社统一出版。这一部分并用许多文稿和图片说明经典著作的翻译工作正逐渐改进，并更慎重更细致地进行排印工作，更广泛地展开发行工作。
    展览会并用图表说明马克思列宁主义怎样武装了中国近几年来的各种政治运动，使社会主义的理想在工业、农业和各种建设方面逐渐实现。
    把马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东同志及其亲密战友的各种著作，也在展览会中陈列出来。
    展览会并陈列了许多有意义的统计表。统计表显示自一九○六年到一九四九年出版的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作只有五百三十二种，自中华人民共和国成立到现在，单是人民出版社出版的马克思列宁主义著作就达一千七百多万册，其中大多数著作都在十版以上。“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”出版了四十四版，“共产党宣言”和“联共（布）党史简明教程”都出版了三十九版。
    展览会在北京西单丰盛胡同西斜街二十号举行。
