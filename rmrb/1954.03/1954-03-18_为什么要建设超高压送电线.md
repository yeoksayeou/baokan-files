Why Build Ultra-High Voltage Power Transmission Lines
Ji Yin

    On the dazzling snowy fields of Northeast China, a moving scene has appeared: More than nine hundred tall iron towers, hand in hand, holding metal wires as thick as sugar cane, weighing more than two thousand tons, are arranged in a long row, crossing the Songhua River over layers of mountains and rivers, spanning three hundred and seventy kilometers, across the long journey of three provinces, extending to the industrial area in southern Northeast China. They all stand like tall giants in the fields and on the tops of mountains, the highest being forty-six meters and the lowest being thirteen point six meters. From a distance, only the tips of the towers, like two antennae, are vaguely stretched into the clouds. The north wind blows the heavy metal wires on the towers, making a "buzzing" sound, echoing in the valleys and wildernesses...
    ——This is the newly built 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line project in Northeast China.
    Why build a 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line? What is its role? What is its relationship with the national industrialization cause? Some readers have raised such questions, and now let’s briefly talk about these.
      Delivering electricity to factories and mines
    To realize the country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to vigorously develop the power industry, because electricity is the main driving force of all modern industries. With electricity, our industry can be developed and turned to new technical tracks, that is, to automation and electrification.
    There are two main methods of power generation: thermal power generation and hydroelectric power generation. Thermal power generation uses fuel (mainly coal) to generate electricity, and hydroelectric power generation uses water power to generate electricity. Hydroelectric power generation is the most ideal source of power, and it has many significant advantages: Because it uses water to generate electricity, it can save a lot of coal. If the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Station in Northeast China used coal to generate electricity, it would burn thousands of tons of coal a day. Coal is an indispensable "grain" for industrial production, transportation, and people's daily life. In the future, when industry is developed, the use of coal will become greater and greater. Because hydroelectric power generation uses free water, its cost is many times cheaper than thermal power generation, which greatly benefits the development of industrial and agricultural production. Many sectors of industry must have a large amount of cheap electricity to develop, such as aluminum smelting, magnesium smelting, nitrogen fertilizer production, caustic soda production, and high-silicon steel smelting. When electricity prices are cheaper, industrial costs decrease, and industrial products also become cheaper. In addition to generating electricity, hydroelectric power generation can also provide many benefits such as flood control, irrigation, and improvement of waterways.
    However, the biggest problem in building hydropower stations is: The rivers that can generate electricity are not necessarily close to industrial areas. Building factories not only has to consider the source of power, but more importantly, it has to consider resources, transportation, and political needs. For example, a steel factory must be built near iron mines. Textile factories must be built in cotton-producing areas. Especially in our country, many rivers that can be used for power generation are in remote areas, far away from cities. This contradiction arises: Factories cannot follow the rivers, and rivers cannot be moved near factories. So how to connect factories and hydroelectric power plants that are thousands of miles apart? This task falls on ultra-high voltage power transmission lines. With it, even if factories and hydroelectric power plants are thousands of miles apart, it is like being next-door neighbors. As soon as the factory turns on the power switch, electricity immediately rushes in, starting the machines rumbling. In recent years, industry in the southern region of Northeast China has developed rapidly. In particular, with the large-scale construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Base, the demand for electricity is increasing day by day. As a result of the expansion of the power base on the Songhua River in the north, the production capacity has also greatly increased. However, in the past, they could not meet each other, blocked by rivers, mountains, and vast fields. Now, with the 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage line, they are tightly connected together. The industrial cities of Anshan, Fushun, Fuxin, Shenyang, Benxi and others in Northeast China now have access to abundant and safe electricity through ultra-high voltage power transmission lines. It will generate greater power, and existing factories and mines will be able to manufacture more heavy industrial products such as steel, oil, coal, and machines, to supply the whole country for building factories and developing production. Various new factories and mines that require a large amount of electricity can also be quickly built or put into production ahead of schedule.
    Ultra-high voltage power transmission lines are also needed for thermal power plants. In the future, we will build many large-scale thermal power plants, because building large power plants is much more economical and reasonable than building small power plants from the overall interests of the country. However, these large thermal power plants should be built near coal mines, so that the large amount of coal used for power generation does not need to be transported long distances by trains and ships, incurring a lot of transportation costs, and there is no need to build a large "coal yard" to store coal. At the same time, being close to coal mines, power plants can easily burn a large amount of low-quality coal and slag from the coal mines. These will greatly reduce the cost of electricity. When electricity prices are cheaper, it will also drive down the cost of other industrial products. However, here comes another contradiction: Coal mines are not necessarily close to industrial areas, factories cannot be completely located next to coal mines, and coal mines cannot be moved next door to factories. So how to connect thermal power plants with factories and cities? This task falls on ultra-high voltage power transmission lines again.
    Our country has a vast territory of about one million square kilometers, with numerous rivers and coalfields rich in water resources. In the future, we will implement widespread electrification, so that the powerful electricity generated from the turbulent upper reaches of the Yellow River and the dangerous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River can be transmitted to the vast urban and rural areas of our country. We need to build many ultra-high voltage power transmission line projects. They are like blood vessels in the human body, constantly transporting fresh blood smoothly from the heart to the whole body.
      Forming a wonderful power grid
    In a city, one night an unfortunate event suddenly occurred: The power plant's machinery broke down, and the entire city was plunged into darkness. The trams stopped halfway, the factory's machinery stopped turning, and movie theaters and theaters stopped performing... But in less than a minute (or even a shorter time), a dazzling light drove away the darkness, thousands of street lights shone brightly again, and the trams started running with a "ding-ding-dang-dang" sound. The machines started singing again with a "rumbling" sound. Everything returned to normal, and it was so fast that people felt as if nothing unfortunate had happened just now.
    Who is working so magically and swiftly in the dark, sending light and heat to the city again? This is the power grid, intricately composed of many power transmission lines.
    Using an ultra-high voltage power transmission line to connect factories, cities, and a certain power plant is only the first step in the work of high-voltage power transmission lines, because in this way, factories and cities still have only one source of power. If this power plant or power transmission line has an accident, the factory will also stop working. In order to make the power supply more economical, safe, and reliable, power transmission lines must also join hands with many power plants and factories and cities to form a power grid. This is the larger and more complex task that power transmission lines must undertake.
    A power grid is a complex "network" that connects several or even dozens of power stations with many power transmission lines. These power stations input the electricity they generate from all directions into the power grid like small rivers converging into the sea, and then send it to factories and cities. Under the command of a supreme commander (the national power dispatching agency), they form the best "production combination": During the spring flood season, when hydropower stations can send a large amount of electricity, it is necessary for hydropower stations to send more electricity, because the cost of hydropower is many times cheaper than thermal power. But during the dry season, it orders thermal power plants to help hydropower areas work. Where the cost of electricity is low, it is asked to send more. Where the cost is high, it is asked to send less (these are called economic dispatch). If the machinery of a power plant in a certain place suddenly breaks down, you don't have to panic. In less than a minute, its most loyal brothers - the electricity from power stations everywhere will come to help from thousands of miles away, so everything is as if there is no power outage, and the power plant can calmly repair the damaged machinery. Before the power plant joined this "production combination," it had to prepare extra spare generators in order to continue sending electricity during machine maintenance. With a power grid, the commander can arrange maintenance in a planned way, asking other power stations to guarantee power transmission during the maintenance period. This saves many spare generators, and the country reduces a lot of investment. As for the many spare generators that are saved, they can be used to build new power plants.
    A power grid is composed of various power transmission lines. It is like the blood circulation system in the human body, with arteries, veins, and capillaries. Ultra-high voltage power transmission lines are the arteries in the power grid. It sends powerful electricity to other blood vessels, and then distributes it to all parts of the body. Therefore, ultra-high voltage and high-voltage power transmission lines are the decisive part of the power grid. The newly built 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line in Northeast China is the artery connecting the Northeast power grid.
      Past and Future
    The widespread construction of ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and the planned connection of the country's power plants into several power grids is forever impossible in capitalist countries based on private ownership of the means of production. The Soviet writer Ilyin once told a story: In 1930, a German engineer named Oskar von Miller wrote a book called "Electricity Public Ownership Theory." He listed many facts and figures to prove how beneficial it would be to merge all the power plants in Germany and manage them in a unified manner. However, the fate of this book was extremely tragic: The capitalists ignored it, and the general public was not interested in it, because everyone knew that this was just a ridiculous fantasy. Ilyin said: "Many countries have general plans for electrification. Engineers are dreaming of a large electrical network covering the whole of Europe. Everyone knows that a joint electrical system is much more economical than many separate systems. But these kinds of plans are not real plans, but just some good wishes."
    Old China has never had and could never have had ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and power grids of such a large scale as today. This is because before liberation, China's power industry, like other industries, was in the tragic situation of a semi-colonial industry. In cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, where China's power was most concentrated, power areas were divided into pieces along with the imperialist aggression forces. Tianjin City was split into several power areas such as Japan, Britain, France, and Belgium. Shanghai's power area was also divided into many pieces by American, French and other colonists and bureaucratic capital, and they constantly squeezed and fought against each other. It was the same in large cities and across the country. There used to be a story: One year, a power plant in a certain place in North China was flooded, all the factories were out of power, and urgently requested assistance from power plants in Tianjin and other places, but no one paid attention to him, resulting in huge losses in that area. - This is just one of countless unfortunate events in the past. Under these circumstances, it was naturally impossible to build such huge ultra-high voltage power transmission lines as today, to connect the power of various places and coordinate work.
    To widely build ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and realize the good wish of building a power grid, we can only take the road of socialist industrialization. Because socialist industrialization is not carried out according to the insatiable desires of capitalists, but according to the maximum interests of the country and all the people. Therefore, the construction of ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and power grids has been quickly put on the actual agenda of industrial construction and quickly started. Today, the Soviet Union has become the country with the most developed power grid in the world. In the Ural industrial area, in the Donbass, Dnieper area and Rostov and other places, the world's largest ultra-high voltage power transmission lines, thousands of miles long, connect many power plants together, supporting each other and echoing each other, making the equipment utilization rate of Soviet power plants reach the highest level in the world.
    The widespread construction of ultra-high voltage power transmission lines and the connection of the country's large power plants into several large power grids is also an important part of our country's industrialization cause. Now, such power grids have been built in some areas of our country. The Northeast power grid is the largest power grid in our country, and the completion of the 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line has further increased the effectiveness of this power grid. The 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage power transmission line in Northeast China is the first power transmission line in our country that is designed and constructed by ourselves, with the highest voltage and the longest route. With this construction experience, we will be able to erect the second, third, and even more high-voltage power transmission lines more smoothly in the skies of our motherland in the future.
    The completion of the ultra-high voltage power transmission line shows us a happy future: from the upper reaches of the Yellow River on the Northwest Plateau to the Qiantang River by Hangzhou Bay; from the cold Songhua River to the famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, in short, in the future, on many rivers and coalfields of the motherland, power stations will join hands like giants, tightly forming a whole, transmitting endless electricity to all parts of the country, illuminating the vast urban and rural areas like a large garden in full bloom. The fantasy of the German engineer Muller's "Electricity Public Ownership Theory" twenty-four years ago will forever be a sad fantasy in capitalist countries. But in our beloved motherland, building a power grid is no longer a fantasy, but has been put on our construction agenda and is being gradually realized.

    为什么要建设超高压送电线季音
    在白雪耀眼的东北原野上，出现了一个动人的景象：九百多座高大的铁塔，一个个手牵着手，擎着像甘蔗一样粗的、二千多吨重的金属电线，排成了一条遥长的行列，从松花江畔越过重重叠叠的山峦和河流，跨过三百七十公里、三个省境的漫长路程，一直延伸到东北南部的工业区。它们都像高大的巨人一样耸立在田野上和山巅上，最高的有四十六公尺，最低的也有十三点六公尺，从远处望去，只见像两只触角一样的塔尖，隐隐约约地伸进云层里，北风吹着塔上沉重的金属电线，发出“嗡嗡”的响声，回荡在山谷里和旷野上……
    ——这就是东北新建的二十二万伏超高压送电线工程。
    为什么要建设二十二万伏超高压送电线？它的作用是什么？它与国家工业化事业有些什么关系？有读者提出了这样的问题，现在就来简略的谈谈这些。
      把电送到工厂和矿山
    要实现国家的社会主义工业化，就一定要努力发展电力工业，因为电是一切近代工业的主要动力。有了电，我们的工业才能发达起来，并使它们转到新的技术轨道上去，即转到自动化和电气化的轨道上去。
    发电方法主要的有火力发电和水力发电二种。火力发电是利用燃料（主要是煤）来发电，水力发电是利用水力来发电。水力发电是最理想的电力来源，它有许多重大的优点：因为它用水来发电，就可以省下大量煤炭。像东北丰满水力发电站如果用煤炭来发电，一天就要烧掉数千吨煤。煤是工业生产、交通运输和人民日常生活所不可缺少的
  “粮食”，将来工业发达了，煤的用途要愈来愈大。因为水力发电用的是不要钱的水，它的成本要比火力发电便宜许多倍，这就大大有利于工农业生产的发展。工业中有许多部门的生产必须有大量廉价的电才能发展起来，如炼铝、炼镁、制氮肥、制烧硷、炼高矽钢等都是如此。电价便宜了，工业成本下降了，工业品也就便宜了。水力发电除了能发电之外，还可以得到控制洪水、引水灌溉、改善航道等许多好处。
    但建设水电站最大的问题是：可以发电的河流并不一定是和工业区靠在一起的。建设工厂不但要考虑动力的来源，更重要的还要考虑资源、交通等条件和政治上的需要。譬如钢铁工厂，它就一定得建设在铁矿的附近。纺织工厂得建设在产棉区。特别是我国可以利用发电的许多河流都在边远地区，离开城市都很远。这样矛盾就发生了：工厂不能跟着河流跑，河流又不能搬到工厂附近。那么如何使天各一方的工厂和水力发电厂联系起来呢？这个任务就要超高压送电线来担负。有了它，即使工厂和水力发电厂相距数千里，也好像隔壁邻居一样，工厂里只要把电门一开，电立即就赶到，把机器轰隆轰隆地开动起来。东北的南部地区这几年来工业发展得很快，特别是鞍山钢铁基地的大规模兴建，电的需要量一天天的激增；而北部松花江上的动力基地由于扩建的结果，生产能力也大大提高了，但是过去它们被一道又一道的河流、山岭和广大的田野阻隔着不能相见。现在有了二十二万伏超高压线，就把它们俩个紧紧地连在一起了。东北鞍山、抚顺、阜新、沈阳、本溪等工业城市现在通过超高压送电线取得了丰富而安全的电力，它就会产生出更大的力量，现有的工厂和矿山就能够制造出更多的钢铁、石油、煤、机器等重工业产品，供给全国各地去建设工厂和发展生产；各种需要大量用电的新工厂、新矿山，也就能够迅速地兴建起来或提前投入生产。
    超高压送电线对于火力发电厂也是同样需要的。我们将来要建设很多规模宏大的火力发电厂，因为建设大发电厂从国家的整体利益来计算，要比建设小发电厂经济合理得多。但这些大的火力发电厂应该建设在煤矿附近，使得大量发电用的煤不需要再用火车、轮船长途运输，耗费许多运输费用，也不要再建设很大的储存煤的“煤场”。同时靠近煤矿，发电厂也便于燃烧煤矿里大量的低质煤和煤渣。这些都会使电的成本大为降低。而电价便宜了，也就带动了其他工业品成本的降低。可是，这里矛盾又来了：煤矿并不一定是和工业区靠在一起的，工厂不能完全设在煤矿边上，煤矿更不能搬到工厂隔壁。那么如何使火力发电厂和工厂、城市联系起来呢？这个任务又落在超高压送电线身上。
    我们的国家拥有一万左右平方公里的辽阔土地，有着众多的水力资源丰富的河流和煤田，将来要实行广泛的电气化，使急流汹涌的黄河上游和天险的长江三峡发出来的强大电力，都能输送到我国广大城乡，就要建设起许多超高压的送电线工程，它好比是人体里的血管一样，不断地把新鲜的血液从心脏通畅地输送到全身。
      组成奇妙的电力网
    在一个城市里，有一天晚上突然发生了不幸：发电厂的机器损坏了，全城顿时陷入黑暗中，电车停在半路上，工厂的机器不再转动，电影院、剧院停止了演出……，但不到一分钟（甚至更短的时间），一片刺眼的光亮就驱走了黑暗，千万盏路灯又大放光明，电车“叮叮当当”的开始行驶，机器“轰隆轰隆”的重新唱起歌来。一切都恢复了常态，而且是那样的神速，以致使人们觉得仿佛刚才并没有发生过什么不幸的事件一样。
    是谁在暗中这样神奇而迅捷地工作着，把光和热又送给了城市？这就是用许多送电线错综复杂地组成的电力网。
    用一根超高压送电线使工厂、城市和某个发电厂联系起来，这只是高压送电线的第一步工作，因为这样工厂和城市还只有一个电力来源，万一这个发电厂或送电线出了事故，工厂就会跟着停工。为了使电力供应做到更加经济、安全和可靠，送电线还必须把许多发电厂和工厂、城市拉起手来，组成一个电力网。这是送电线所要担负起来的更大和更复杂的任务。
    电力网就是用许多送电线，把数个乃至数十个发电站联系起来成为一个复杂的“网”，这些发电站从四面八方把发出的电力，像小河汇入大海一样输入电网，然后送到工厂和城市。它们在一个最高指挥员（国家的电力调度机关）的指挥下组成了一个最良好的“生产组合”：在春汛期间水电站能大量送电时，它就要水电站多送电，因为水力电的成本要比火力电便宜许多倍；但当枯水季节，它又命令火力发电站帮助水电地区工作；那里电的成本低，就叫它多送；那里成本高，就叫它少送（这些就叫做经济调度）。假如某地发电厂的机器突然坏了，但你不用慌，不消一分钟，它最忠实的兄弟们——各地发电站的电都会纷纷不远千里地赶来帮助，于是一切都像没有停电一样，发电厂可以从容地修理损坏的机器。发电厂在没有参加这个“生产组合”以前，为了进行机器检修，不得不准备多余的备用发电机，以便在检修时继续送电，有了电网，指挥员就可以有计划地来安排检修，要其他发电站保证在检修期间送电，这就省了许多备用的发电机，国家减少了大量投资。至于那些被节省下来的许多备用发电机，就可以用来去建设新的发电厂。
    电力网是用各式送电线组成的，它好比是人身上的血液循环系统一样，有大动脉，有静脉，也有微血管。超高压送电线就是电网中的大动脉。它把强大的电力送到其他血管，以后又分布到人身各部，所以超高压和高压送电线是电网中起决定作用的部分。东北新建的二十二万伏超高压送电线路，就是联系东北区电力网的大动脉。
      过去和将来
    广泛建设超高压送电线，把全国的发电厂有计划地联结成若干个电力网，这在以生产资料私有制为基础的资本主义国家，是永远不可能的。苏联作家伊林曾经讲过一个故事：一九三○年时，德国有一个叫做俄斯卡·冯·缪勒的工程师，写了一本“电力公有论”的书，他列举了许多事实和数字，证明合并全德国的发电厂，统一管理，是怎样怎样有利。但是，这本书的命运却极为悲惨：资本家们谁也没有去理睬它，一般的人对它也没有兴趣，因为大家都知道这不过是可笑的幻想。伊林说：“许多国家都有电气化的总计划。工程师们摹想着全欧洲罩着一个大的电气网。人人都知道一个电力联合系统比许多分离的系统要经济得多。但是这类计划都不是真实的计划，只不过是一些很好的愿望。”
    旧中国也从来没有、也不可能有像现在这样规模巨大的超高压送电线和电力网。这是因为解放前我国的电力工业正如同其他工业一样，是处在半殖民地工业的悲惨境地里的。在我国电力最集中的上海、天津、广州等城市里，过去电力区域也随着帝国主义侵略势力的割据而被分割得四分五裂。一个天津市，就被分裂为日本、英国、法国、比利时等几个电力区。上海的电力区，也被美国、法国等殖民者和官僚资本分割成许多块，相互之间不断的排挤和倾轧。在大城市如此，在全国范围内同样如此。曾经有一个故事：有一年，华北某地的一个发电厂被水淹没了，所有的工厂都停了电，紧急恳求天津等地的电厂支援，但是谁也没有答理他，结果使那个地区遭受了浩大的损失。——这不过是过去无数不幸事件中的一件而已。在这种情况下，自然就不可能建设起像今天那样巨大的超高压送电线，把各地的动力联结起来，协调地进行工作。
    要广泛建筑超高压送电线，实现建设电力网的良好愿望，只有走社会主义工业化的道路。因为社会主义工业化不是按照着资本家们贪得无厌的欲望进行的，而是按照着国家和全体人民的最大利益进行的，因而超高压送电线和电力网的建设很快就被摆到工业建设的实际程序上来迅速着手解决了。今天，苏联已成为世界上电力网最发达的国家，在乌拉尔工业区，在顿巴斯、第聂伯区和罗斯托夫等地，世界上最大规模的、上千里路长的超高压送电线，把许多发电厂联结在一起，相互支援，相互呼应，使苏联发电厂的设备利用率达到世界上的最高水平。
    广泛建设超高压送电线，把全国各地的大发电厂联结成若干个大电力网，这也是我国工业化事业中的重要组成部分。现在，在我国某些地区，已经建成了这种电力网。东北的电力网，是我国最大的电力网，而二十二万伏超高压送电线路的建设完成，更增大了这个电力网的效用。东北二十二万伏超高压送电线，是我国第一条自己设计、自己施工、电压最高、路线最长的送电线，有了这次的建设经验，今后我们就可能更顺利地把第二条、第三条，以至更多的高压送电线在祖国各地的高空中竖立起来。
    超高压送电线的建成，给我们展示了幸福的未来：从西北高原的黄河上游，到杭州湾边的钱塘江上；从严寒的松花江，到著名的长江三峡，总之，将来在许多祖国的河流和煤田上，一座座的发电站都将像巨人一样手拉着手，紧紧结成一个整体，把无穷无尽的电力输送到全国各地，把广大城乡照耀得像一座百花盛开的大花园一样。二十四年前德国工程师缪勒“电力公有论”的幻想，在资本主义国家将永远是可悲的幻想。但是在我们可爱的祖国，建设电力网却不再是幻想，而已被排进我们的建设日程上，在逐步地实现着了。
