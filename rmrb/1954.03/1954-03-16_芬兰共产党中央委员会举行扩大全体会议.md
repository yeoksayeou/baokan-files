    Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, March 15th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Finland held an enlarged plenary session in Helsinki on the 13th to discuss the domestic situation, the tasks facing the party, and the preparations for the Tenth Party Congress.

    The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Finland, Ville Pessi, delivered a speech at the meeting, summarizing the domestic situation, analyzing the recent election results, and proposing the party's current tasks.

    In discussing the recent parliamentary elections, Pessi pointed out that the struggle in this election was more intense in nature than in previous elections. Pessi said that supporters of pro-American policies not only wanted to defeat the electoral alliance of people's democratic forces but also wanted to defeat the Agrarian League. However, the election results made it more difficult for the reactionaries to form a government according to their plans. Therefore, this result signifies a victory for the peace-loving Finnish people. This election shows that the Communist Party of Finland and the People's Democratic League have established universal prestige and enjoy great support among the Finnish people.

    芬兰共产党中央委员会举行扩大全体会议
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基讯：芬兰共产党中央委员会于十三日在赫尔辛基举行扩大全体会议，讨论国内的局势和党所面临的任务以及第十次党代表大会的筹备工作。
    芬兰共产党总书记维利·培西在会上发表演说，综述了国内的局势，分析了最近的选举情况，提出了党的当前任务。
    培西在谈到最近的议会选举时指出，在这次选举中的斗争，按性质来说比以往选举中的斗争更为激烈。培西说，亲美政策的拥护者不仅想击败人民民主力量的选举联盟，而且想击败农民联盟。但是，选举的结果使得反动派更难于按他们的计划成立政府。因此，这个结果意味着爱好和平的芬兰人民取得了胜利。这次选举说明，芬兰共产党和人民民主联盟在芬兰人民中建立了普遍的威信，并享有很大的支持。
