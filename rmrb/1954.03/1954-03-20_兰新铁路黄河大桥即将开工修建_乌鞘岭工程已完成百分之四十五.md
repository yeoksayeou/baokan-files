    The Yellow River Bridge is one of the key projects of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. In order to extend the railway forward ahead of schedule, a temporary bridge was first built in January 1953 to ensure the completion of the track-laying task last year.

    Construction of the Yellow River main bridge is scheduled to begin this year. Currently, workers are actively carrying out various preparatory tasks. Shipbuilding technicians from Hankou have already built two large wooden boats with a carrying capacity of fifty tons; steel sheet piles, indispensable for the construction, have been transported from the Northeast; crane operators have strung three aerial lines across the Yellow River and are now actively preparing to build a temporary construction bridge. On the construction site, dormitories, clubs and offices with an area of more than 1,000 square meters are under construction and will be completed by the end of March. Soon, over a thousand employees will be working on both banks of the Yellow River.

    Furthermore: The Wushaoling project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which has been under construction during the winter, is progressing rapidly. As of the end of February, forty-five percent of the entire project has been completed. Among them, the pilot tunnels of the Wushaoling Tunnel and Longgou No. 1 Tunnel, which are known as key projects of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, have been opened, and the main structures of several bridges have also been completed. The rapid completion of these projects guarantees that the track-laying will start from the 190-kilometer point of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway on June 1st as scheduled.

    The largest tunnel in the Wushaoling construction area is the Wushaoling Tunnel. In order to open the tunnel, the workers are divided into three shifts, working day and night, fighting against hard rock, cohesive soil, and water seepage in the thin air and cold climate of about minus twenty-six degrees Celsius, and constantly improving work efficiency. The project progress has increased from the initial two to three meters of excavation per day to four to five meters of excavation per day, and the quality also meets the standards. During the construction, the workers learned advanced Soviet experience. The pilot tunnel project adopted the method of excavating inwards from both ends, and opened a skylight and a cross tunnel in the middle of the pilot tunnel, so that one project could have five working faces at the same time, giving full play to the effectiveness of labor. In addition, all employees implemented the operation plan and various responsibility systems, which made the project progress even smoother.

### 兰新铁路黄河大桥即将开工修建  乌鞘岭工程已完成百分之四十五

    兰新铁路黄河大桥即将开工修建
    乌鞘岭工程已完成百分之四十五
    黄河大桥是兰新铁路关键工程之一。为了使火车提前向前伸展，一九五三年一月先修成了便桥，保证了去年铺轨任务的完成。
    黄河正桥工程决定在今年施工。目前工人们正积极进行施工前的各项准备工作。从汉口来的造船技术工人，已造好载重五十吨的大木船两只；施工中不可缺少的钢板桩，已由东北运来；起重工人已拉好横跨黄河的三根天线，现在正积极准备修筑施工便桥。在工地上，正在施工的一千多平方公尺面积的宿舍、俱乐部和办公室，将在三月底完工。不久，千余名职工将在黄河两岸进行工作。
    又讯：在冬季施工中的兰新铁路乌鞘岭工程，进展很快。到二月底为止，已完成全部工程的百分之四十五，其中被称为兰新铁路关键工程的乌鞘岭隧道和龙沟一号隧道的导坑都已打通，好几个桥梁的主体工程也完成了。这些工程的迅速完成，对预定自六月一日从兰新铁路一九零公里处开始向西铺轨，起了保证作用。
    乌鞘岭工区最大的一个隧道，就是乌鞘岭隧道。工人们为了打通隧道，分成日夜三班，在空气稀薄和零下二十六度左右的寒冷气候中，和坚石、胶土、渗水作斗争，并不断地提高工作效率，工程进度由开始的每日掘进二、三公尺，提高到每日掘进四、五公尺，质量同样合乎标准。在施工中，职工们学习了苏联先进经验。隧道导坑工程，是采取两头向内开挖的方法，并在导坑中间开挖一个天井和一个横洞，使一个工程能同时有五个工作面，充分发挥了劳动力的效能，再加上全体职工贯彻了作业计划和各种责任制，使工程进展更加顺利。
