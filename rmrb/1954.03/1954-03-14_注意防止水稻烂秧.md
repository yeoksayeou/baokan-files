    Notice on Preventing Rice Seedling Rot
    General Bureau of Agricultural Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government
   (1) The Situation of Rice Seedling Rot in Various Regions in Recent Years
    In recent years, rice seedling rot of varying degrees has occurred in the major rice-producing areas of our country during the spring rice seedling raising period, especially in 1951 and 1953, which were more widespread and serious. In 1951, in provinces such as Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Sichuan, the area affected by seedling rot generally reached about 30% of the seedling field area, and in severe cases, it reached 60%. In 1953, the rice seedling rot area in the Central and South China region generally reached 30% to 40%, and in severe cases, it reached 90%. In the East China region, provinces such as Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu generally reached 15% to 30%, and in severe cases, it reached 80%. The situation was lighter in the Southwest region, such as Sichuan and Guizhou, but the seedling rot area generally reached about 14%, and in severe cases, it reached 40%.
    Seedling rot causes great damage to rice production. First of all, a lot of rice seeds are lost. According to statistics from 26 counties and one city in Hunan Province, the loss of rice seeds due to seedling rot last year was 8 million catties. In Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, according to incomplete statistics, more than 131,000 catties of rice seeds were rotted last year. Secondly, seedling rot requires replanting, which often delays the rice transplanting period, affecting the normal growth and development of rice and reducing yield. For example, in Lin'an County Farm, Zhejiang Province, due to replanting after seedling rot in 1953, the rice transplanting time differed by about a week. After harvesting and comparison, under the same cultivation conditions, the average yield per mu for those transplanted on May 7th and 8th was 417.5 catties, while those transplanted on May 14th had an average yield of only 334.5 catties per mu.
    (2) Causes of Rice Seedling Rot
    A. Influence of Climate: During the seedling raising period, gradually rising temperatures and sunny weather are needed. If cold air strikes and there is continuous rain, causing water accumulation in the seedling fields, seedling rot will occur. According to the climate records of Hengyang City, Hunan Province, during the seedling raising period (April) from 1950 to 1953, the temperature was low, rainfall was high, and sunshine was less in 1951 and 1953, so the seedling rot situation was particularly serious in these two years. This is because seedlings need sunlight, air, and temperature in the early stage of growth. However, in the case of continuous rain, there is insufficient sunlight, the temperature is low, and the seedling fields are prone to water accumulation, even submerging the seedlings, causing the seedlings' respiration and photosynthesis to slow down or stop. In this way, the metabolism of the seedlings is hindered, and the vitality of the seedlings weakens, eventually leading to death, thus causing seedling rot.
    B. Poor Arrangement and Location of Seedling Fields: 1. Inconvenient drainage of seedling fields, uneven land preparation, or improper location can easily cause seedling rot when cold air strikes and there is continuous rain. For example, the seedling fields in Chashi Township, Hengnan County, Hunan Province, were generally unevenly prepared last year and had no drainage ditches, causing water accumulation in the seedling fields, which resulted in severe seedling rot. On the contrary, the seedling fields of Lu Xiubin and Huang Jiaqing in Santang Township of the county were finely prepared, the seedling beds were flat, and irrigation and drainage were convenient, so the seedling fields did not accumulate water, and there was no seedling rot. Xiao Gongcheng's seedling field in Daqiao Township, District 17, Hengyang County, was facing the northwest wind last year, and the seedling rot rate reached 80%. The seedling field of Xiao Guizhou's mutual aid team in the township was in a sheltered place, and the seedling rot rate was only 3%. 2. Applying unfermented human manure or other fertilizers in the seedling fields, or using green manure fields as seedling fields, damages the seedling roots due to the toxicity of urea or the high temperature generated by fertilizer decomposition and fermentation, resulting in seedling rot. Last year, the Xiong Chungui mutual aid team in District 5, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, applied 20 loads of fresh human manure per mu before sowing, and the seedlings rotted even after two sowings. The Wang Jinrui mutual aid team in Shuangxi Township, Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, used green manure fields as seedling fields, and the seedling rot rate reached 60% because the green manure was not fully decomposed during sowing. In some areas, a thick layer of plant ash is spread on the seedling beds before sowing, which makes it difficult for the seedling roots to penetrate into the soil to absorb nutrients, weakens growth, and easily causes seedling rot. For example, Chen Xiling and Zhou Miaogen, farmers in Luoxia Village 5, Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, spread bottom ash before sowing last year, resulting in seedling rot, while the seedling field of Zhou Zhifan, who lived nearby and did not spread bottom ash, did not have seedling rot.
    C. Improper Seed Treatment and Untimely Sowing: 1. Over-germination during germination or failure to pay attention to seed turning can easily cause seedling rot. For example, Luo Qiqiu, a farmer in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, suffered severe seedling rot last year due to over-germination. Wang Shangtang in Qiyang County used baskets for germination last year, and because he did not turn the seeds regularly, the seeds in the middle were burned. According to the inspection after sowing, 40% of the seeds in the middle of the basket rotted, and 20% of the seeds on the edges rotted. In addition, improper storage of seeds, dampness, and mildew will also affect their vitality. After germination, the growth potential weakens, and when encountering adverse environments, it is easy to cause seedling rot. 2. Sowing too early, when the temperature is too low, can also cause severe seedling rot. Deng Jinshui, a farmer in Nancheng County, Jiangxi Province, sowed rice seedlings for the first time on February 28, 1953. Due to the low temperature, all of them rotted. The second time he sowed on the Jingzhe Festival, half a month earlier than the local general sowing period, and half of them rotted again. However, the sowing period should not be delayed, because delaying sowing will also affect the normal development of rice and reduce yield.
    D. Untimely Irrigation and Drainage of Seedling Fields: 1. Failure to deepen the irrigation water in time to缓和（lessen, alleviate, moderate) the sudden change in temperature when the temperature drops sharply can also easily cause seedling rot. For example, the seedling fields of Yang Youquan and Chen Baoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, suffered from spring cold damage and seedling rot last year because they did not pay attention to weather changes and irrigate in time. 2. Failure to pay attention to drainage during continuous rain, exposing the tips of the seedlings, will cause the seedlings to rot due to suffocation. According to experiments by the Nancheng County Farm in Jiangxi Province, in the case of prolonged rain, the seedlings in the waterlogged seedling fields rotted completely, while the seedling fields that were drained at any time to maintain shallow water did not have seedling rot.
    Based on the above situation, the influence of adverse climate is the main cause of seedling rot. However, under normal circumstances, the impact of adverse climatic conditions on seedlings can be appropriately changed by adopting excellent cultivation techniques. For example, the minimum temperature that generally causes seedling rot is around 7 or 8 degrees Celsius. If the seedlings are growing very strongly, such a low temperature is not enough to cause serious seedling rot. The main reason why some seedlings rot and some do not rot or some have a lighter degree of seedling rot and some have a heavier degree of seedling rot in the same year with the same weather lies in this.
    (3) Main Methods to Prevent Seedling Rot
    A. Improve the arrangement and fertilization of seedling fields to create a suitable environment for seedling growth: First of all, choose a place with convenient irrigation and drainage, sunny and sheltered from the wind, and flat terrain to make seedling fields. In this type of seedling field, irrigation and drainage facilities should be set up to facilitate water control. The land should be carefully tilled and harrowed to level the land to facilitate irrigation. For seedling field fertilization, fast-acting fertilizers should be used. Farm manure, cake fertilizer, human manure, etc., should be applied after fermentation. If green manure fields are used as seedling fields, the green manure should be plowed into the soil at least 20 days before land preparation to allow it to fully decompose.
    B. Do a good job in seed soaking, germination, and sowing to cultivate strong seedlings and enhance the seedlings' resistance to adverse environments: Rice seeds should be selected to be pure and full. The seeds should be dried before soaking to improve the seeds' vitality. In order to remove diseased grains and chaff grains, seed selection should also be carried out with mud water or salt water. Clean water should be used for soaking seeds. In order to prevent cold damage, germination should not be too long. The experience of the masses of "sowing buds on sunny days and sowing grains on cloudy days" can continue to be researched and adopted. Pay attention to the regulation of temperature, moisture, and air during germination. Some areas use straw bags for germination, which makes the temperature difficult to control, and the germination length is uneven. The successful experience of the local masses should be summarized and improved. Seedlings should be sown sparsely and evenly, and sowing should be done in a timely manner according to the local climate conditions.
    C. Correctly master irrigation and drainage techniques, regulate the temperature of the seedling fields, circulate air, and reduce the impact of adverse environments on seedling growth. During the seedling growth period, shallow water should generally be irrigated to allow the seedling fields to absorb heat and ventilate. In colder areas, the temperature difference between day and night is large, so the water should be drained during warm sunny days (maintaining shallow water of one or two points) to allow the seedling fields to absorb sunlight and increase soil temperature. In the afternoon, deeper water should be irrigated to maintain temperature and prevent evening frost damage. In warm areas with small temperature differences between day and night, shallow water should be irrigated during the day to avoid sunburn on the seedlings, and the water should be drained at night to allow air to circulate, facilitating seedling respiration. In case of storms and sudden drops in temperature, or hail, deep water should be irrigated regardless of day or night to缓和(lessen, alleviate, moderate) the drastic changes in temperature, but the duration of deep water irrigation should not be too long to avoid drowning the seedlings. In case of continuous rain, the water should be drained at any time to expose the tips of the seedlings so that the seedlings do not suffocate. When the weather clears up after continuous rain, the seedlings grow weakly, and the water should be drained gradually, not suddenly drained completely, to prevent strong sunlight from burning the seedlings. When irrigating seedling fields, the water should be introduced into neighboring fields to be heated by the sun first. For rice seeds that have not been germinated, about one inch of shallow water can be irrigated before sowing. There is no need to change the water before germination to avoid temperature differences caused by changing the new water, which can cause seedling rot. After emergence, the water should be gradually reduced to expose the tips of the seedlings.
    Cultivating strong seedlings and preventing seedling rot is a series of meticulous tasks, so it is necessary to pay attention to a series of cultivation techniques, master each link, to prevent or reduce the phenomenon of seedling rot. Labor models in various rice-planting areas have rich experience in cultivating strong seedlings and preventing seedling rot. We should cherish these experiences and summarize and promote them.

    注意防止水稻烂秧
    中央人民政府农业部农业生产总局
   （一）几年来各地水稻烂秧情况
    近几年来，我国主要水稻产区，在春季育秧期间，曾发生轻重不同的烂秧现象，尤以一九五一和一九五三两年较为普遍而严重。一九五一年浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、四川等省，烂秧面积一般达秧田面积的百分之三十左右，严重的达百分之六十。一九五三年中南区水稻烂秧面积一般达百分之三十到四十，严重的达百分之九十。华东区的福建、浙江、江苏等省，一般达百分之十五到三十，重的达到百分之八十。西南区四川、贵州等省较轻，但烂秧面积一般也有百分之十四左右，严重的达到百分之四十。
    烂秧对水稻生产的损害很大。首先是要损失很多稻种，据湖南省二十六个县一个市的统计，去年因烂秧损失的稻种就有八百万斤，福建省晋江县不完全的统计，去年共烂掉稻种十三万一千多斤。其次是烂秧需要重新播种，这样就时常延迟了插秧期，影响水稻的正常生长与发育，减低产量。如浙江省临安县农场一九五三年因烂秧补种，稻田插秧时间先后相差一周左右。经收获后比较，同样耕作条件，在五月七、八日适期插秧的，每亩平均产量四一七点五斤，在五月十四日插秧的，每亩平均产量只有三三四点五斤。
    （二）水稻烂秧的原因
    甲、气候的影响：在育秧期间，需要温度逐渐上升和晴朗的天气，如果遇到寒流袭击，阴雨连绵，秧田积水，就会引起烂秧。根据湖南省衡阳市一九五○年至一九五三年育秧期间（四月份）的气候记载可以看出。一九五一和一九五三两年的气温低、雨水多、阳光少，因而这两年的烂秧情况就特别严重。这是因为在秧苗生长初期，需要日光、空气、温度。但在阴雨连绵的情况下，阳光不足，温度低，秧田容易积水，甚至淹没秧苗，致使幼苗的呼吸作用和光合作用进行缓慢或停顿，这样，秧苗的新陈代谢作用受到阻碍，秧苗的生活力随着减弱，以至逐渐死亡，因而造成烂秧现象。
    乙、秧田的整理和位置不好：一、秧田排水不便，整地不平或位置不当，遇到寒流袭击，阴雨连绵，就容易引起烂秧。如湖南省衡南县茶市乡的秧田，去年普遍整地不平，未开排水沟，秧田积水，因此烂秧严重。相反的，该县三塘乡陆秀宾、黄家庆的秧田，整地精细，秧板平整，灌溉排水方便，秧田不积水，就没有烂秧。衡阳县十七区大桥乡萧功升去年的秧田当着西北风口，烂秧达百分之八十，该乡萧贵州互助组的秧田在避风处，烂秧只有百分之三。二、在秧田中施用没有经过腐熟的人粪尿或其他肥料，或用绿肥田做秧田，由于尿素的毒害或肥料分解发酵所发生的高温，损害了秧根，以致造成烂秧现象。江西省宜春县五区熊春桂互助组，去年在播种前每亩施用新鲜人粪尿二十担，连播两次的秧都烂了。江西省南城县双溪乡王金瑞互助组，用绿肥田做秧田，因播种时绿肥还没有充分腐熟，烂秧达百分之六十。有些地区，播种前在秧板上撒施较厚的草木灰，因此使秧根不易扎入土中吸收养分，生长衰弱，容易烂秧。如江苏省无锡县落霞五村农民陈锡令、周妙根，去年播种前撒了底灰，结果烂了秧，邻近的周志繁的秧田未撒底灰，就没有烂秧。
    丙、种子处理不当和播种不适时：一、在催芽时催芽过长或不注意种子翻动，也都容易烂秧。如湖南省衡南县农民罗其球去年就因催芽过长，烂秧严重。祁阳县王上唐，去年在箩筐中催芽，因没有经常翻动，中间部分的种籽被烧坏，据播种后的检查，箩筐中间的种谷烂秧的百分之四十，边上的烂秧百分之二十。此外，种子贮存不当，受潮发霉，也会影响它的生活力，发芽后生长势衰弱，遇到不良环境，就容易烂秧。二、播种过早，温度太低，也可能发生严重的烂秧现象。江西省南城县农民邓金水，一九五三年第一次播种的稻秧是在二月二十八日，由于温度太低，全部烂掉，第二次在惊蛰节播种，比当地一般播种期早半个月，又烂了一半。但播种期也不宜延迟，因为，延迟播种，也会影响水稻正常发育，减低产量。
    丁、秧田灌溉、排水不及时：一、在气温骤然下降时，没有及时加深灌水，缓和温度突然变化，也容易烂秧。如浙江省新登县杨有全、陈宝元两农业生产合作社的秧田，去年由于没有注意到天气变化，及时灌水，结果遭到春寒为害，发生烂秧。二、在阴雨连绵时，没有注意排水，露出秧尖，秧苗就会因窒息而烂掉。据江西省南城县农场试验，在久雨连绵情况下，积水的秧田，秧苗全部烂掉，随时排水，保持浅水的秧田没有烂秧。
    根据以上情况来看，不良气候的影响是烂秧的主要原因。但是，在一般情况下，采用优良的耕作技术，是可以适当地改变不良气候条件对秧苗的影响。如一般引起烂秧的最低温度在摄氏七、八度左右，如果秧苗生长很健壮，这样的低温并不足引起严重的烂秧。在同一年内，一样的天气，有的烂秧有的不烂秧或有的烂秧程度轻，有的烂秧程度重的主要原因就在此。
    （三）防止烂秧的主要方法
    甲、改进秧田的整理和施肥工作，创造秧苗生长的适宜环境：首先要选择灌溉排水方便、向阳避风、地势平坦的地方做秧田。在这种秧田中要作好灌溉、排水设备，以便于控制用水，要精细耕耙，平整土地，以利灌溉。秧田施肥，要用速效性的肥料，厩肥、饼肥、人粪尿等都要腐熟后施用，用绿肥田做秧田，至少要在整地前二十天，把绿肥耕翻入土，使它充分腐熟。
    乙、作好浸种催芽及播种工作，培育壮秧，增强秧苗对不良环境的抵抗力：稻种要选用纯净饱满的，浸种前要进行晒种，以提高种子的生活力，为了除去病粒、秕粒还应进行泥水或盐水选种，浸种要用清洁的水。为防止寒流的损害，催芽不宜过长。群众中的“天晴种芽，天阴种谷”的经验可以继续研究采用。催芽时要注意温度、水分和空气的调节。有些地区用草包催芽，温度不好掌握，发芽长短不齐，应总结当地群众成功经验，加以改进。秧田播种要稀要匀，要根据当地气候情况适时播种。
    丙、正确掌握灌溉、排水技术，调节秧田温度、流通空气，以减轻不良环境对秧苗生长的影响。在秧苗生长期内一般应灌浅水，以便秧田吸热通风，在较冷地区，昼夜温度差异较大，因此在晴暖的白天要排水（保持一、二分的浅水），以使秧田吸收阳光，增加土温，到下午则应灌较深的水，以保持温度，预防晚间冻害。在气候温暖昼夜温度差异不大地区，白天应灌浅水，以免晒伤秧苗，夜间应把水排出，通透空气，便于秧苗呼吸。如遇暴风骤雨及温度骤然下降，或降雹时，无论昼夜，均应灌深水，以缓和温度的急剧变化，但灌深水时间不宜过长，以免淹死秧苗。如遇阴雨连绵，则应随时排水，露出秧尖，使秧苗不致窒息。阴雨乍晴，秧苗生长衰弱应逐渐排水，不要突然放干，以防止强烈阳光灼伤秧苗。秧田灌水，应先引入邻田晒热。未经催芽的稻种，播种前可灌一寸左右浅水，在没有发芽前不必换水，以免由于换进新水，产生温度差异，引起烂秧。出苗后应逐步将水放浅到露出秧尖。
    培育壮秧，防止烂秧，是一系列的细致工作，因此必须注意一系列的耕作栽培技术，掌握好每一环节，才能防止或减轻烂秧的现象。各种植水稻地区的劳动模范对培育壮秧、防止烂秧多有丰富的经验，我们应珍视这些经验，并加总结推广。
