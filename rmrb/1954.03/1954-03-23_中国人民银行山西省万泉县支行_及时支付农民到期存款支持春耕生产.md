    The People's Bank of China, Wanquan County Branch, Shanxi Province
    Timely Payment of Farmers' Matured Deposits to Support Spring Plowing and Production
    The People's Bank of China, Wanquan County Branch in Shanxi Province, entrusted rural credit cooperatives and organized mobile teams to promptly pay farmers' matured deposits to meet the farmers' capital needs for spring plowing and production.
    In order to pay the large number of matured deposits to scattered depositors in a timely manner and put them into production as early as possible, the Wanquan County Branch changed its past practice of waiting for depositors to come to the bank to withdraw their money. The branch entrusted rural credit cooperatives throughout the county to act as agents for paying the deposits of farmers in their respective jurisdictions; for depositors in areas without credit cooperatives, the bank formed several mobile payment teams to make payments during gatherings and meetings, or, where possible, deliver the matured deposits to the farmers' homes. This not only saved farmers' time and facilitated withdrawals, but also dispelled the concerns of some people who feared that "it is easy to deposit but difficult to withdraw," strengthened the relationship between farmers and the state bank, and laid the foundation for further development of rural deposit business.

    中国人民银行山西省万泉县支行
    及时支付农民到期存款支持春耕生产
    中国人民银行山西省万泉县支行，委托农村信用合作社和组织流动小组及时支付农民到期存款，满足农民春耕生产资金的需要。
    万泉县支行，为了把大量的到期存款及时地支付给分散的存户，早些投入生产，改变了过去等存款户上门取款的办法。该行委托全县的农村信用合作社，代理支付所辖区农民的存款；对没有信用合作社地区的存户，银行组成了若干流动付款小组，利用集、会进行支付，或在可能情况下把到期存款送到农民家中。这样不仅节省了农民时间，便利取款，同时也打消了有些人怕“好存难取”的顾虑，密切了农民与国家银行的关系，为进一步开展农村存款业务打下了基础。
