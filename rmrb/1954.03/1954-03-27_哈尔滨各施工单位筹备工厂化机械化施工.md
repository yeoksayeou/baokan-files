Harbin's construction departments are preparing to greatly increase the proportion of prefabricated and mechanized construction this year. This will play a significant role in accelerating project progress, saving material transportation costs, and ensuring safe construction.

Currently, major construction units in Harbin, such as the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, the Metal Structure Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration, the No. 2 Engineering Company of the Electrical Industry Administration, the No. 2 Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Harbin No. 1 Engineering Company, are actively expanding their mechanical equipment, training technical personnel, and carefully considering plans and compiling construction organization designs to make prefabricated and mechanized construction the primary construction method. The No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration has decided to establish a concrete mixing plant, a precast concrete plant, a foam board prefabrication plant, a model board processing plant, a steel bar processing plant, and a mortar mixing plant, and will expand its existing woodworking and ironworking plants, adding a large number of construction machines such as excavators, concrete pouring machines, transportation machines, cranes, and tampers. Currently, some mechanical equipment has been transported to the site, and some mechanical equipment is being ordered from various parts of the country. The company is also seizing the time to complete the overhaul of existing mechanical equipment. The Metal Structure Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration built a 1,000-square-meter welding factory last year. Currently, six cutting machines, one winch, five drilling machines, and four grinding machines have been added to the machine workshop so that semi-finished products can be manufactured in the factory and sent to the construction site for installation after construction begins.

In order to better prepare for prefabricated and mechanized construction, all units have sent people to experienced units several times to learn. The No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration organized a study group to Anshan to learn experience. Leading cadres of the No. 2 Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau and the Harbin No. 1 Engineering Company studied the experience of prefabricated and mechanized construction at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory last year and visited the site. All units also have plans to increase technical strength, especially to vigorously train workers who operate and repair machinery. At the beginning of this year, the No. 1 Engineering Company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration established a mechanized construction team and a equipment section responsible for the storage and supply of mechanical equipment; it also organized a mechanical worker training class and a concrete worker training class, with more than 350 workers studying hard. After the training, 60 percent of the workers are expected to reach the level of Grade 4 workers.

    哈尔滨各施工单位筹备工厂化机械化施工
    哈尔滨市各施工部门，今年将大大增加工厂化机械化施工的比重。这对加速工程进度，节省材料运费、保证安全施工将起很大作用。
    目前，哈尔滨市的主要施工单位如有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司、有色金属工业管理局金属结构工程公司、电器工业管理局第二工程公司、东北建筑工程局第二工程公司、哈尔滨市第一工程公司等，都在积极扩充机械设备、训练技术力量，并在周密地考虑计划，编制施工组织设计，使工厂化机械化施工成为主要的施工方法。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司，已决定建立混凝土搅拌厂、混凝土预制厂、泡沫板预制厂、模型板加工厂、钢筋加工厂、灰浆搅拌厂，并将扩充原有的木工厂和铁工厂，增添大量的挖土机、混凝土浇灌机、运输机、起重机、打夯机等施工机械。目前，一部分机械设备已经运到，一部分机械设备正派人去国内各地订购，该公司并抓紧时间，完成了原有机械设备的检修工作。有色金属工业管理局金属结构工程公司，去年已将一个一千平方公尺的电焊厂修建起来，目前，又在机械厂房内添置了六台切断机、一台卷扬机、五台钻床、四台砂轮机，以便开工后先在厂房内制成半成品送到工地安装。
    为了使工厂化机械化施工的准备工作做得更好，各单位都几次派人到有经验的单位去学习。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司，曾组织学习组去鞍山学习经验。东北建筑工程局第二工程公司、哈尔滨市第一工程公司领导干部学习了哈尔滨量具刃具厂去年工厂化机械化施工的经验，并到现场观摩。各单位还有计划地增长技术力量，特别是大力培养操纵机械和修理机械的工人。有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司今年年初就已成立了机械化施工队，并成立了设备股，负责机械设备的保管、供应工作；又组织了机械工人训练班和混凝土工人训练班，三百五十多名工人正在紧张学习。经过学习，将有百分之六十的工人可以达到四级工水平。
