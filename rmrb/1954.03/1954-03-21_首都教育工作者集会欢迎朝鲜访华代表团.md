Xinhua News Agency: Capital educators held a gathering on the evening of the 20th to warmly welcome the education representatives of the Korean People's Delegation to China. The representatives reported on the heroic deeds of the Korean educators in the war against the American aggressors, as well as the restoration and development of Korean cultural and educational undertakings after the armistice.

Bai Nan-un, deputy leader of the Korean People's Delegation to China, and Shin Keon-hee, the education representative, attended the welcome meeting held by capital educators. Among those who attended the meeting were Yang Xiufeng, Zeng Zhaolun, and Liu Aifeng, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government; Wei Que, Dong Chuncai, and Liu Shi, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Education; Chu Tunan, Chairman of the Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee; Lin Handa, Vice Chairman; and Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University; Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University, and more than 700 others. After Vice Minister Yang Xiufeng delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, Representative Shin Keon-hee gave a report. Shin Keon-hee said: Korean teachers and students displayed patriotic fervor, dedicating themselves to the motherland to win victory in the war against the American aggressors. Many teachers and students joined the People's Army, and teachers Shin Cheon-gun and student Hwang Jung-soo, among others, were awarded the title of "Hero of the Republic." During the most difficult days of the war, teachers and students worked together to move classrooms underground and continue classes as usual, so that most of the school-age children were able to attend school. In September 1951, many middle schools, eleven normal schools, and fifteen universities gradually resumed teaching. After the victory of the armistice in Korea, Korean teachers and students quickly moved the schools from underground to the ground, and transformed from scattered study groups to regular collective teaching. Universities that had been evacuated to deep mountain areas returned to their original locations before the war. At present, Korea's cultural and educational undertakings are gradually being restored and developed.

After Representative Shin Keon-hee's report, Deputy Leader Bai Nan-un spoke to warm applause. He said: Cultural exchanges between Korea and China have a history of more than 2,000 years. The Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed between Korea and China last November will further develop and consolidate the economic and cultural mutual assistance and cooperation between our two peoples.

    首都教育工作者集会欢迎朝鲜访华代表团
    据新华社讯：首都教育工作者在二十日晚集会，热烈欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团中的教育界代表。代表们报告了在反抗美国侵略者的战争中，朝鲜教育工作者英勇斗争的事迹，以及停战后朝鲜文化教育事业的恢复和发展情况。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团副团长白南云和教育界代表申健熙，出席了首都教育工作者举行的欢迎会。参加大会的有中央人民政府高等教育部副部长杨秀峰、曾昭抡、刘皑风，教育部副部长韦悫、董纯才、柳湜，扫除文盲工作委员会主任委员楚图南、副主任委员林汉达以及北京大学副校长汤用彤、清华大学副校长刘仙洲等七百多人。会上，杨秀峰副部长致欢迎词后，申健熙代表在会上作了报告。申健熙说：朝鲜师生在反抗美国侵略者的战争中，发挥了为争取胜利而献身祖国的爱国热忱。很多教员和学生参加了人民军，教员申川君和学生黄正洙等，都获得了“共和国英雄”的称号。在战争中最艰苦的日子里，教员和学生们共同努力，把教室搬到地下照常上课，使所有的学龄儿童大部能够就学。在一九五一年九月，许多中学和十一个师范专门学校以及十五个大学，都陆续恢复了教学。在朝鲜胜利停战以后，朝鲜师生很快把学校从地下搬到地面上来，由分散的学习班转变为正规的集体教学。疏散到深山地带去的大学校，又都回到了战前自己原来的所在地。目前，朝鲜的文化教育事业正在逐步恢复和发展起来。
    申健熙代表报告后，白南云副团长在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说：朝中两国的文化交流，已经有两千多年的历史。去年十一月，朝中两国签订的经济及文化合作协定，更将使我们两国人民的经济和文化互助合作关系进一步发展与巩固。
