China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company Jinan Branch
Supplies Farmers with Spring Ploughing Production Materials

    The Jinan Branch of the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Company is actively supplying farmers with spring ploughing production materials such as vehicle tires and wheel bearings.
    In the past, the company had the idea that rural areas had "small sales" in its business thinking, so it neglected rural supply work. Last year, although the Dezhou Prefectural Branch of the Shandong Provincial Cooperative General Agency repeatedly made suggestions, the company never supplied them. After the publicity and education of the general line, all employees of the company realized the important significance of actively supplying farmers with materials for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. In January of this year, they organized cadres to go deep into rural areas and industrial and mining areas such as Dezhou, Huimin, and Zibo for investigation and promotion. After the company investigated and understood the needs of farmers on the one hand, and carried out business promotion on the other hand, cooperative societies in various places proposed the quantity of goods they needed. According to incomplete statistics in January, the company supplied rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises with goods such as tires and rubber cables worth more than 6 billion yuan. Because the commodities were cheap, of good quality, and supplied in a timely manner, they were welcomed by farmers. For example, the same "valve core" sold for 9,800 yuan per box at the company, while private merchants sold it for 50,000 yuan. A farmer in Huimin County said after buying some parts for a large cart: "In the past, we had to spend a lot of effort to go to the city to buy a tire, which was not convenient and delayed production. Now it is delivered to our door, which is really good."
    In order to further understand the rural market situation, the company has now organized three investigation and promotion teams to conduct investigations in various special zones in order to correctly organize purchases and continue to supply farmers' needs.

    中国交通电工器材公司济南支公司
    供应农民春耕生产资料
    中国交通电工器材公司济南支公司，积极供应农民车轮胎、轮轴承等春耕生产资料。
    过去该公司在经营思想上存在着农村“销量不大”的想法，所以忽视了农村供应工作。去年虽然山东省合作总社德州专区分社多次提出意见，可是该公司始终没有供应。经过总路线的宣传教育后，该公司全体职工认识到了积极供应农民物资，对巩固工农联盟的重要意义，在今年一月份就组织干部深入到德州、惠民、淄博等农村和工矿区调查和推销。经该公司一方面调查了解农民需要，一方面进行业务宣传，各地合作社便纷纷提出要货数量。据一月份不完整的统计，该公司就供应了农村及工矿企业部门价值六十余亿元的轮胎、皮线等商品。由于商品价格便宜、质量好、供应及时，受到了农民的欢迎。如同样的“气门心”，该公司卖价是每盒九千八百元，而私商却要卖五万元。惠民县一个农民买到了大车上用的一些零件后说：“过去我们买个轮胎得费很大的劲到城里去买，又不方便还耽误生产，现在给送上门来了，真好。”
    该公司为了更进一步摸清农村市场情况，现又组织了三个调查推销组，分别到各专区进行调查，以便正确组织进货，继续供应农民需要。
