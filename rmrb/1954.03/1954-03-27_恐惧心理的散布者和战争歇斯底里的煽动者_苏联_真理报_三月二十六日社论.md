Xinhua News Agency, Moscow:

    The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference played a certain positive role because it eased international tensions to some extent. The unanimous resolution on a meeting of representatives from the five countries of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, with the participation of other relevant countries, provides the possibility of a final peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and a cessation of the war in Indochina. In Europe, a movement is developing more and more broadly, demanding that reliable guarantees of peace be established through the establishment of a collective security system with the participation of all relevant countries, and not through the formation of military blocs by certain countries against other countries. Finally, there are also some signs that the development of trade and cultural relations has improved. Therefore, it is quite natural that the people of Europe and the world begin to look forward with hope to the possibility of further easing of international tensions. In many countries, especially in Britain and France, voices against the notorious "Cold War" policy are becoming louder day by day.
    However, this prospect clearly violates the interests of American monopoly capital, which is attempting to prevent an economic crisis in the United States, or at least mitigate the increasing impact of the economic crisis, through unlimited arms expansion.
    In order to maintain and exacerbate international tensions, American monopoly capital is attempting to make American taxpayers, as well as taxpayers in countries of the Atlantic camp, obediently and without complaint pay for the expenses required for huge arms expansion plans, from which monopoly capital can obtain billions in profits. American diplomacy, especially the head of diplomacy, in order to implement the will of the monopoly capital interested in new war orders, is sparing no effort to re-intensify the international tense atmosphere.
    Recently, the United States has once again loudly issued hysterical clamor, as if the United States and its allies were really threatened by the "Soviet bloc." US Secretary of State Dulles is playing the role of the main propagator of this baseless lie.
    For example, when Dulles delivered a speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 19, he exhausted all means to convince the audience that the existence of the "Soviet bloc," which has territory "stretching from the Elbe River in Germany to the Pacific coast" and uniting 800 million people—as Dulles put it—"is the most serious threat we (the United States) have ever encountered." According to Dulles, due to the "inevitable" "dissatisfaction and unfulfilled ambitions... existing in the capitalist world," "this threat" is even more serious.
    This leader of American diplomacy rudely distorted the Soviet Union's political goals and demanded that the armed forces of the United States and its allies prepare to conduct "large-scale retaliation (?)" "without delay." He has had to change his previous position on this issue more than once.
    The problem is that in his previous statements, especially in his speech in New York on January 12, Dulles, in a fit of agitated bellicosity, lost all sense of reality and even said that if a local conflict occurred anywhere, the United States was prepared to use all weapons, including atomic bombs, to wage war at a location it chose and against any target it chose. From this speech, it can be inferred that the United States' Atlantic Pact and Pan-American Pact allies would be involuntarily dragged into this war of aggression, and even without having to seek their consent. Now, in the Senate committee, Dulles has changed his original position on this issue. He said that the United States does not attempt "to turn every (!) local war into a major war."
    This last statement proves that Dulles had to change what he said earlier due to accusations from within and outside the United States against his openly aggressive statement. The threat posed by the most aggressive groups in the United States, that is, the threat of launching a world war under the pretext they deem appropriate, without going through the US Congress or the consent of their allies, has made the vast public in the United States itself and government officials in all countries of the Atlantic group feel very uneasy.
    More sober Americans know that the adventurous military policy promoted by Dulles is also dangerous to the United States itself. Former Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson said in a speech in Miami Beach City on March 7 that implementing this policy would create a situation where American cities could also be destroyed.
    This policy makes America's allies deeply worried about their future. Even those who enthusiastically support American policy are disturbed by the fact that the question of whether their countries are to be involved in another world war, that is, the question of their survival, will not be decided by the governments of these countries, but by a small group of American politicians who are trying to seize the right to arrange the fate of other countries according to their wishes.
    Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson's speech in Washington on March 15 clearly expressed this dissatisfaction.
    Pearson opposed Dulles' desire to decide on war and peace at will, pointing out that the Canadian people are dissatisfied with the fact that "our fate (Canada's fate) may not be decided by ourselves, but by people on the other side of our border." Referring to the adventurous nature of this policy, Pearson said: The formulators of this policy have a chill and fever attack to "a degree of frenzy."
    British newspapers pointed out in alarm that if Britain were to hold a different position, the United States might drag Britain into the vortex of a world war. This reflects the great unease that the clamor about the "new military policy" has caused in Britain. Some newspapers demand that the ruling groups in the United States should consult with their allies.
    However, all these warnings have apparently not made Dulles abandon his adventurous "new military policy." Although he intended to dispel the impression given by his January 12 statement when he delivered a speech to the Senate committee, the essence of the policy he advocated remains the same.
    It is very obvious that the attempt of the US Secretary of State to create an atmosphere of war hysteria in the entire capitalist world has a certain purpose. This shows that on the one hand, they are trying to hinder further easing of international tensions and poison the international atmosphere, and on the other hand, they are intimidating ordinary Americans, so that they can pay without complaint for the huge war preparation plans that are very beneficial to American monopoly capital. That is exactly what the spreaders of fear and the instigators of war hysteria are doing. Only those who have no confidence in tomorrow, those who have no tomorrow, would take such action.
    Dulles's statement is nothing but an attempt to instigate war hysteria in the United States to please the aggressive-minded groups in the United States. It is precisely because the Berlin Conference has brought about a certain easing of international tensions that these people are very dissatisfied, so they are now sparing no effort to prevent the upcoming Geneva Conference from proceeding smoothly.
    The conspiracy of the US ruling groups to stir up an atmosphere of terror and war hysteria will never strengthen the position of American diplomacy on the world stage, nor will it prevent the looming economic crisis in the United States. It is very likely to produce the opposite result. The extensive economic and military mobilization that the United States has recklessly carried out has exacerbated the crisis trend, intensified the struggle between monopoly capital, and further reduced the living standards of the American people.
    In terms of foreign policy, advocating hostility among the people of all countries and preparing for another war will make, and cannot but make, the most aggressive group in the United States expose their own faces and become isolated. They want to use their policies to hinder the peace-loving forces of all countries from solving the unresolved international problems and hinder the further easing of international tensions.

### 恐惧心理的散布者和战争歇斯底里的煽动者——苏联“真理报”三月二十六日社论

    恐惧心理的散布者和战争歇斯底里的煽动者
    ——苏联“真理报”三月二十六日社论
    柏林四国外长会议起了一定的积极作用，因为它使国际紧张局势得到了一定程度的缓和。关于法、英、美、苏、中华人民共和国五国代表在其他有关国家参加下举行会议的一致决议，提供了最后和平解决朝鲜问题和停止印度支那战争的可能。在欧洲，一个运动正在愈来愈广阔地发展，这个运动要求通过成立一个有所有有关国家参加的集体安全体系的办法，不是通过使某些国家结成军事集团反对其他国家的办法，来建立可靠的和平保证。最后，也有一些迹象说明贸易文化关系的发展有了改进。所以，欧洲和世界各国的人民开始怀着希望的心情展望着国际紧张局势进一步缓和的可能是十分自然的。在许多国家中，特别是在英法等国家中，反对臭名昭彰的“冷战”政策的声音一天比一天响亮了。
    但是，这种前景显然违反了美国垄断资本的利益，它们正企图以漫无限制的扩军来阻止美国发生经济危机，或者至少是缓和一下经济危机的日益增加的冲击力。
    为了维持并加剧国际紧张局势，美国垄断资本企图使美国纳税者以及大西洋阵营国家的纳税者温顺地、毫无怨言地付出庞大的扩军计划所需的经费，而垄断资本却可从这个计划中获得亿万利润。美国外交方面，特别是外交首脑为了执行对新的战争订货感到兴趣的垄断资本的意志，正不惜采用种种办法重新加剧国际紧张空气。
    美国近来又大声发出了歇斯底里的喧嚷，好像美国及其盟国真的受到了“苏联集团”的“威胁”似的。美国国务卿杜勒斯在担任这个毫无根据的谎话的主要传布者。
    例如，三月十九日杜勒斯在参议院外交委员会发表演说时，曾用尽方法使听众相信，有着“从德国的易北河伸展到太平洋海岸”的疆土、团结着八亿人民的“苏联集团”的存在本身——如杜勒斯所说的——“就是我们（美国）曾经遇到过的最严重的威胁”。据杜勒斯说，由于资本主义世界“不可避免地存在的”“不满和未能满足的野心，……”，“这种威胁”更加严重了。
    这位美国外交界的领袖粗暴地歪曲苏联的政治目的，要求美国和它盟国的武装部队准备起来，以便能“毫无迟延地”进行“大规模的反击（？）。”他不止一次地不得不改变他自己以前在这个问题上所表明的立场。
    问题是，在他以前的声明中，特别是在他一月十二日在纽约发表的演说中，杜勒斯在激动的好战情绪下，丧失了一切现实感，竟说，如果在任何地方发生了地方性的冲突，美国准备在它所选择的地点、对它选择的任何对象，用一切武器，包括原子弹在内，进行战争。从他这篇演说可以推论，美国的大西洋公约和泛美公约盟国会不由自主地被拖入这次侵略战争，而且甚至还不必征求它们的同意。现在，在参议院委员会中，杜勒斯在这个问题上改变了他原来的立场。他说，美国并不企图“把每一个（！）地方性战争变成一个大战。”
    这个最后的声明证明，由于美国国内外指责他公开的侵略性的声明，杜勒斯不得不改变他以前所说过的话了。美国最富有侵略性的集团所造成的威胁，就是说，不通过美国国会，也不经过它们盟国的同意，就在它们认为合适的借口下发动世界大战的威胁，使美国本国的广大公众和大西洋集团所有各国的政府人士都感到非常不安。
    比较清醒的美国人知道，杜勒斯鼓吹的冒险的军事政策，对美国本身也是危险的。民主党以前的总统候选人史蒂文森三月七日在迈阿密海滩城发表演说时说，实行这种政策，会造成一种局势，使得美国城市也可能被毁灭。
    这种政策使美国盟友为他们的前途深感忧虑。甚至那些热心支持美国政策的人们，都由于这样的事实而感到不安：他们的国家是否要卷入另一次世界大战的问题，也就是他们生死存亡的问题，将不由这些国家的政府决定，而是由一小撮美国政客们决定，这一小撮美国政客正力图夺得权利来依照他们的心愿安排其他国家的命运。
    加拿大外交部长皮尔逊三月十五日在华盛顿发表的演说，明白地表现出这种不满。
      皮尔逊反对杜勒斯想要随心所欲地决定战争与和平问题，指出加拿大人民对于这样的事实感到不满：“我们的命运（加拿大的命运）可能不由我们自己决定，而是由我们边界那边的人来决定。”皮尔逊提到这种政策的冒险性质时说：这种政策的制定人发寒热病发作到“一种热狂的程度了”。
    英国报纸惊慌地指出：假若英国要抱着不同的立场时，美国可能要把英国拖进世界大战的漩涡，这反映了关于“新军事政策”的叫嚣已在英国引起极大的不安。一些报纸要求美国的统治集团应该和它的盟友们商量。
    然而所有这些警告的呼声显然都没有使得杜勒斯放弃冒险的“新军事政策”。虽然他在参议院委员会里发表演说时打算消除他的一月十二日的声明所给人的印象，但是他所鼓吹的政策的本质仍然是一样。
    非常明显，美国国务卿坚持要在整个资本主义世界造成一种战争歇斯底里气氛的企图，是有一定目的的。这表明他们一方面竭力阻挠国际紧张局势进一步缓和并毒害国际气氛，另一方面恫吓普通美国人，从而使他们毫无怨言地为对美国大垄断资本十分有利的庞大备战计划出钱。恐惧心理的散布者和战争歇斯底里的煽动者所作所为正是如此。只有那些对于明天没有信心，那些没有明天的人才会采取这种行动。
    杜勒斯的声明的目的不是别的，就是想在美国煽动战争歇斯底里以讨好美国的侵略成性的集团。正是由于柏林会议使得国际紧张局势有了一定的缓和，这班人感到很不满意，所以他们现在不惜任何代价使即将举行的日内瓦会议不能顺利进行。
    美国统治集团煽起恐怖与战争歇斯底里气氛的阴谋绝不会使得美国外交在世界舞台上的地位有所加强，也绝不会阻止住在美国日益逼近的经济危机。这倒很可能产生相反的结果。美国所轻率地进行的广泛的经济军事化使危机趋势更加恶化，使垄断资本之间的斗争更加剧烈，使美国人民的生活水平更加降低。
    在外交政策方面，在各国人民之间鼓吹敌意与准备另一次战争的结果，将使得而且不能不使得美国侵略性最大的那帮人暴露自己的面目和孤立起来，他们想通过自己的政策阻挠各国爱好和平的力量解决尚未解决的国际问题，阻挠国际紧张局势进一步缓和。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科讯）
