    Repair work on the Yangtze River's lower reaches embankment has comprehensively commenced. This spring's earthwork project for repairing the Yangtze River's lower reaches embankment totals 1.7 million cubic meters of earth and over 7,000 cubic meters of stone. In Anhui Province, where work started earlier, more than one-half of the earthwork project has been completed. It is expected that the entire embankment repair project in the lower reaches can be completed by early April. The total length of the main dikes on both banks of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from the estuary to near Jiujiang City in the west, is more than 1,400 kilometers. Since liberation, the People's Government has vigorously led farmers in repairing them, completing more than 50 million cubic meters of earthwork. The height of each section of the dike generally meets the standard of being one meter above the highest flood level in previous years. This year, the Yangtze River's Lower Reaches Water Conservancy Bureau, based on drilling data, has decided to renovate sections of the embankment to further eliminate hidden dangers and consolidate the dike's structure. After the repair of the Yangtze River's lower reaches embankment, more than six million mu of farmland in over thirty counties along the river in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces will be directly protected, and the safe production of factories and mines along the river, such as the Ma'anshan Iron Mine in Anhui and the jointly owned Dasheng Textile Company Haimen No. 3 Factory in Jiangsu, can be guaranteed.

    长江下游培修江堤工程开工
    长江下游春季培修江堤工程已经全面开工。今年长江下游春修江堤土方工程共一百七十万公方，石方七千多公方，开工早的安徽省境内土方工程已完成二分之一以上。整个下游江堤培修预计四月初可以全部完工。长江下游两岸干堤，东到入海口西到九江市附近，全长共达一千四百多公里，解放后人民政府大力领导农民培修，完成土方工程五千多万公方，各段堤身一般都已达到高出历年最高洪水位一公尺的标准。今年长江下游水利工程局根据钻探资料确定翻修部分江堤，进一步消灭隐患，巩固堤身。长江下游江堤修好以后，江苏、安徽两省沿江三十多县的六百万亩农田直接受到保护，并可保证沿江的安徽马鞍山铁矿、江苏公私合营的大生纺织公司海门三厂等厂矿安全生产。　　　（新华社）
