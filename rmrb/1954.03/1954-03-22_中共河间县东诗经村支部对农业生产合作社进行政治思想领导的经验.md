The Experience of the Communist Party Branch of Dongshijing Village, Hejian County, in Providing Political and Ideological Leadership to Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Dongshijing Village in Hejian County has 509 households with a population of 2,472. It has 45 Communist Party members, 41 Communist Youth League members, and 36 propagandists. Since 1945, under the leadership of higher authorities, the Party branch began to lead farmers in implementing mutual assistance in agricultural production. By 1952, the village had organized 50 year-round mutual aid teams and 74 temporary mutual aid teams. A total of 391 farm households participated in mutual aid teams, accounting for more than 76.8 percent of the total number of households in the village. In the winter of 1952, the Party members in this village underwent Party rectification and further recognized that only by gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture can farmers be completely liberated from poverty and enjoy a happy and prosperous life. Following this, they conducted education among the peasant masses on the future of social development and the organization of agricultural producers' cooperatives. As a result, 39 farm households from 14 mutual aid teams formed three agricultural producers' cooperatives led by Sun Guizhi (Party branch secretary), Liu Sannv (Party member, Communist Youth League branch secretary), and Liu Fushun (village chief). In 1953, the average yield per mu of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives was 237 jin of grain, exceeding the average yield of the entire village in 1952 (180 jin) by 31.6 percent. The increase in yield fully demonstrated the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The ideological leadership provided by the Party branch to the three agricultural producers' cooperatives played a significant guaranteeing role in consolidating the agricultural producers' cooperatives and increasing production. Its main experiences are as follows:

I. Inspire Farmers' Demands for Establishing Cooperatives, Break Down Concerns about Joining, and Establish Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in a Planned Manner

Before establishing the cooperatives, in order to inspire farmers' demands for establishing cooperatives, the branch first led each mutual aid team to summarize the production achievements and experiences of 1952. In the summary, the mutual aid team members deeply realized that the increase in land yield was the result of listening to Chairman Mao's words and implementing mutual assistance and cooperation. However, many team members felt unsatisfied with the mutual aid teams and demanded further improvement. For example, the Wang Wenxue mutual aid team proposed that because the land in the entire team was cultivated by each household separately, 12 mu of sandy land suitable for growing peanuts was not planted with peanuts, resulting in reduced yields. In addition to other land, if the entire team cultivated it in a unified manner, it could yield more than 3,000 jin of grain. Therefore, the entire team unanimously demanded the establishment of an agricultural producers' cooperative. Some team members even said, "If we can't establish an agricultural producers' cooperative, then we should stop mutual assistance." Many mutual aid teams believed during the summary that mutual aid teams had many contradictions in production that were not easy to resolve, such as frequent disputes during sowing and weeding, and the difficulty in utilizing each person's strengths in labor use. Sun Yeqin, a member of the Sun Guizhi mutual aid team, proposed, "Our oil mill can only operate during the winter and spring slack seasons. It would be better to unite with several other families and implement a division of labor between agriculture and sideline occupations, so that the oil mill can operate all year round." After the summary, many mutual aid teams asked the branch to help establish agricultural producers' cooperatives.

As the enthusiasm of mutual aid teams for establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives increased, the branch further led each mutual aid team to deliberate on the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives. Under the guidance of county and district cadres, the branch divided Party members, Communist Youth League members, and propagandists into groups to explain the nature, prospects, and advantages of agricultural producers' cooperatives to the masses, and introduced the management system and profit distribution methods of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and the neighboring Yin Jianfeng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative through mutual aid team symposiums, mobilizing everyone to discuss. After more than a month of deliberation and discussion, the branch sorted out the thoughts of the masses, which could be roughly divided into three categories:

The first category was those who actively demanded the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives. This included team members who deeply felt the need for mutual aid teams to improve, as well as some women. In the past, during mutual assistance, mostly men went to the fields, and women at home had to cook and feed livestock. After the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, livestock could be fed collectively, and they could also participate in field production.

The second category was those who hesitated and wavered, and even if they joined the agricultural producers' cooperative, they would be uncertain. For example, the old middle peasant Liu Junchun had complete labor, livestock, and farm tools. He thought, "What should I do with my livestock and farm tools after joining the agricultural producers' cooperative?" But he also thought, "I've been in mutual aid with Sun Guizhi for so many years, and we get along very well. I don't want to separate this time, so I'll join!" (He joined, but soon withdrew). The middle peasant Sun Zhanlao didn't have much labor, but he had complete livestock and farm tools. He thought, "Those with livestock and farm tools are sure to suffer after joining the agricultural producers' cooperative. If I don't join, I won't have any work to do in the spring and winter slack seasons." But he also thought, "Sun Mingzhen also joined the cooperative. He's a cadre, and he's no worse off than me in any way. It's not just me who's suffering." So he decided to join the agricultural producers' cooperative. Li Yutian said during a family meeting, "Couples still fight and separate. If people don't have the same mind, the agricultural producers' cooperative might collapse, and it wouldn't be worth it." But his wife said, "Those who join the agricultural producers' cooperative are people who get along with us. If we don't join, we're afraid we won't get along with others." In the end, the whole family agreed to try it for a year. If it didn't work, they would withdraw.

The third category consisted of those who still did not clearly understand the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, and even regarded agricultural producers' cooperatives as eating from a big pot, and therefore were unwilling to join agricultural producers' cooperatives or were afraid of suffering losses and said "wait and see." For example, the middle peasant Sun Chunrong said, "Joining the agricultural producers' cooperative is just eating from a big pot, and you'll suffer again. Putting the land together, regardless of whether there is more land or fewer people, you have to eat the same." Liu Fuyou said at a family meeting, and the whole family agreed: "The first year of running the agricultural producers' cooperative, you have to add farm tools and buy some food, so little money will be left after paying the bills. Let's wait a year!"

In response to the above different ideas, the branch repeatedly explained the advantages of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the specific methods of joining, calculating work points, and distributing dividends through mass meetings, zone meetings, mutual aid team symposiums, and individual talks, breaking various concerns.

After the above full deliberation and education, the branch decided to start establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives and asked the team members who were willing to join the agricultural producers' cooperatives to register. Three agricultural producers' cooperatives were established based on the three mutual aid teams of Sun Guizhi, Liu Sannv, and Liu Fushun, with 39 farmers participating. After the agricultural producers' cooperatives were established, the branch called on everyone to work hard to run the cooperatives well and specifically helped the households who were temporarily unwilling to join the agricultural producers' cooperatives to rectify and consolidate the mutual aid teams.

The three agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established, but how to consolidate the agricultural producers' cooperatives, run the agricultural producers' cooperatives well, and use the agricultural producers' cooperatives as the backbone to drive the village's mutual aid and cooperation movement and production increase movement is a series of tasks that the branch must carry out. The branch divided eight Party members and five Communist Youth League members (twelve of whom are propagandists) participating in the agricultural producers' cooperatives into three agricultural producers' cooperatives, so that they could conduct political and ideological leadership work on the agricultural producers' cooperatives through them. They implemented the "contracting" method, and played a guiding role in the progress of team members in every agricultural activity of the agricultural producers' cooperatives.

II. Strengthen Collectivism and Patriotism Education and Strive to Consolidate Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives

After the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, contradictions frequently occurred between the individual interests and collective interests of team members, between short-term interests and long-term interests, and between the interests of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the interests of the state. These contradictions were expressed in every specific issue from the time team members joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. Regarding land, team members were concerned about the high or low assessment of their own land yields during the "four assessments" (assessing land yields, assessing the prices of livestock and large farm tools, and assessing the scores that each laborer should set), and they were also concerned about the amount of fertilizer applied to their own land during cultivation. During the "four assessments," five households in Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and six households in Liu Fushun Agricultural Producers' Cooperative wanted to evaluate their land production at a high amount. For example, Xia Zhenhai's land could not actually yield one dan, but he insisted on assessing it as one dan, and the team members assessed it as four dou. When sending fertilizer, Liu Zhendong was afraid that his land would become barren, so he tried to apply more fertilizer to his land. Sun Zhanrong proposed that his manure was of good quality and should be applied to his land. Regarding labor point recording, they demanded more points be recorded for themselves. For example, Liu Bingquan of the Liu Sannv Agricultural Producers' Cooperative was not as good at weeding as women, but he insisted on recording more points than women. Regarding the public property of agricultural producers' cooperatives, team members generally lacked a sense of conscious care at the beginning. For example, Liu Laosi lost a stone for sharpening sickles when harvesting wheat, and said, "Anyway, everyone will pay for it!" Regarding labor discipline, there was a lack of habit of compliance. For example, female team member Li Dajuan did not tidy up cotton branches properly, and when others raised their opinions, she got angry and went home without working. Regarding the distribution issue, although fair and reasonable methods were established, some team members always wanted to take advantage of loopholes. For example, Zhao Changxing of Liu Fushun Agricultural Producers' Cooperative planted seven mu of cotton and three mu of sweet potatoes in his land. Each mu of cotton could yield more than 190 jin, and the sweet potatoes also grew well. He insisted on dividing half of the cotton from his land. Li Yuxiang's three mu of land was completely planted with sesame, and he insisted on dividing half of the sesame; their reason was: "The distribution method is land five labor five." The team members of Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, whose land was flooded by lye water, said: "My grandfather did not cure the low-lying land, and now there is low-lying land!" "It's a good deal if they don't want wages for the flooded low-lying land, and they still want to divide things!" In addition, team members of various agricultural producers' cooperatives seriously had the idea of ​​trying to take advantage of the country and developing capitalism. Seeing that neighboring villages made 30 million yuan by selling cattle, they applied for loans from the bank to sell cattle. The bank did not lend to them and resented the bank. Zhao Yichang said: "Why join the agricultural producers' cooperative if it's not for taking advantage?" Individual team members also developed the emotion of withdrawing from agricultural producers' cooperatives if they were not allowed to engage in commerce. Agricultural producers' cooperatives that engaged in sideline occupations were more likely to develop capitalist tendencies. For example, Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative had an oil mill, and Wu Fuqi proposed: "Private oil mills can all evade taxes, can't our agricultural producers' cooperative evade taxes!"

For the above problems, the branch took the following methods to educate the team members and solve them.

First, patiently and thoroughly persuade and educate the team members, and combine it with concrete problem solving. During the "four assessments" at the time of joining the cooperative, when applying fertilizer, and when distributing income, the branch repeatedly explained to the team members: Agricultural producers' cooperatives are unified operations, and everyone shares the benefits and losses. The interests of the team members and the interests of the agricultural producers' cooperatives are consistent. Everyone must not be selfish in order to run the cooperative well, and everyone will benefit from running the cooperative well; we must also educate team members to look at the long-term, such as the issue of flooded land. Don't just see that less food is produced this year, but also see that low-lying land can produce more wheat next year. On the other hand, specific measures were proposed through discussions within the agricultural producers' cooperatives to resolve the disputes that occurred. For example, for the dispute over Xia Zhenhai's land assessment, it was calculated based on the average output of three years after everyone's discussion, and it was assessed as five dou; the amount and type of fertilizer applied to each piece of land were discussed and decided by everyone based on the crops planted.

Second, mobilize team members to have democratic discussions, overcome the phenomenon of idling, and improve the management system. During the spring plowing and sowing, the phenomenon of idling was very serious in the three agricultural producers' cooperatives. In Liu Sannv Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, because the agricultural team leader Wang Wenxue lacked planning, he could not put forward specific opinions when studying work every night, and everyone followed suit, resulting in a lot of wasted manpower. It took 24 people to plant one and a half mu of cotton. Work that could be done in one morning took half a day, and twenty-four labor points were recorded. Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative also wasted a lot of time every day due to assembly. When thinning millet seedlings, Sun Mingchen got up early to ring the bell, and by the time the team members gathered, it was time for breakfast, so he went back to eat, and as a result, it was almost noon when he went to the field. The branch seized on this issue and organized team members from the three agricultural producers' cooperatives to discuss why they were idling, the harm of idling, and how to overcome the phenomenon of idling. During the discussion, the team members of Liu Sannv Agricultural Producers' Cooperative criticized and gave opinions to the agricultural team leader Wang Wenxue. Finally, after discussion by all team members, a method of "the agricultural team leader should put forward opinions on work every day, and everyone should discuss and pass it for implementation" was adopted, and the agricultural team leader was re-elected. The branch also organized the three agricultural producers' cooperatives to study the work point recording method of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative again. The team members discussed and came up with: Work points are determined according to each person's labor attitude, work quantity, and quality of work, and the "fixed points are recorded alive" method is adopted, and work is evaluated once a day. (Editor's note: With the accumulation of experience in organizing labor and production within the team, attention should be paid to avoid the problems of too many meetings or too long meeting times when evaluating work and calculating points.) In this way, not only was the problem of idling solved, but also the enthusiasm of the team members for production was improved. Third, by commending the advanced and criticizing the backward, team members are educated to care for public property and abide by labor discipline. Liu Laosi, who lost the grinding stone, was also indecisive in production. He often said: "Just do whatever the director tells you to do!" After propagandist Liu Jixiang educated him, he raised his awareness, and not only was he active in production, but he also often provided suggestions to the director on improving production. The branch then invited Liu Laosi to report on his ideological transformation at the team members' meeting. Liu Laosi finally said: "In the past, everyone criticized me, and I always thought that everyone had prejudices against me. Now that I think about it, everyone is doing it to run the agricultural producers' cooperative well." The branch then organized team members to discuss and check their own thoughts in connection with the discussion. From the discussion, everyone clearly realized that in order to run the agricultural producers' cooperative well, everyone must care about the agricultural producers' cooperative, care for public property, actively work, and be active. Finally, everyone put forward guarantees for active labor and care for public property.

Fourth, regularly evaluate and reward models and set up role models. The three agricultural producers' cooperatives selected two to three models twice a year, a total of eleven people (some of whom were selected two or even three times). The selection of models was held at the general meeting of team members after the completion of a large production season. In addition to giving honorary rewards (mainly this) and appropriate material rewards to the selected models at the meeting, those who care for public property, work hard, have new creations or actively learn new farming technologies, can unite and help team members and individual farmers, and consistently abide by labor discipline were also commended separately. Through the selection of models, not only did all team members conduct a profound examination of their thoughts and actions, but also the entire team had a living example to learn from. For example, Sun Chan of the Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative did all the hard and heavy work, and fed the two livestock in the oil mill until they were fat, truly regarding the agricultural producers' cooperative as his own home, and was selected as a model three times. The team members all proposed to learn from Sun Chan.

Fifth, regularly educate team members on patriotism and the future of social development. It explains that small interests should be subordinate to large interests, and agricultural producers' cooperatives can only increase grain production if they do a good job in agricultural production; only with more grain production can they support the country's industrial construction and the great cause of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Activities such as selling large cattle, engaging in commerce, tax evasion, speculation and profiteering, although the agricultural producers' cooperatives may benefit temporarily, most people suffer, and that is not what agricultural producers' cooperatives should do. The branch also severely criticized the capitalist ideas of certain Party members within the Party. After this education, the ideological bias of some team members who simply relied on government loans and engaged in commerce was eliminated.

Through the above education, team members have made progress in enhancing collectivism, caring for public property within the team, consciously abiding by labor discipline, clarifying the direction of social development, and improving their patriotism awareness, which laid an ideological foundation for consolidating and expanding agricultural producers' cooperatives.
III. Promote Scientific Farming Techniques, Criticize
    Conservative and Backward Thinking, and Make Every Effort
      To Increase Crop Yields
Ensuring increased crop yields is the central key to running agricultural producers' cooperatives well. The Hejian County People's Government sent cadres from the technical station to help the three agricultural producers' cooperatives in this village achieve increased production and promote scientific farming techniques. However, every time a production reform was carried out, it encountered resistance from the conservative and backward thinking of many team members. For example, during spring plowing, the technical cadres suggested that the team use a new-style walking plow, but team member Xia Zhenhai said: "I've lived for more than fifty years and haven't used such a plow, and I've harvested more grain than anyone else." Some team members said: "The walking plow plows deep, and one animal can't pull it. If you use two animals, all the cold soil will be turned up, and the seedlings won't grow well. I think this 290,000 yuan (referring to the money for buying the walking plow) is like buying a piece of scrap iron!" When calling for close planting, most team members said: "Corn is three seedlings per bow, and if you leave it too dense, you'll just eat sweet corn stalks!" When calling for summer manure accumulation, team members thought there was no source of fertilizer. When calling for striving to increase crop yields during the autumn harvest, team members thought: "The year's harvest is determined in August, and no matter how hard you work, it won't help!" In short, all cultivation must be carried out according to the old methods. The branch criticized the conservative and backward thinking of the team members with vivid facts and helped them promote scientific farming techniques. They adopted the following methods:

First, every time a new farming method is promoted, make a demonstration first and use examples to educate team members; and use various propaganda forces to promote it to the whole village, creating a wave of enthusiasm for the whole village to learn new farming methods. For example, to use a new-style walking plow, technical cadres first helped the technical research group of Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative to conduct experiments, proving that one animal can pull the walking plow, and the land is still plowed evenly. After the branch promoted it, not only were all five walking plows of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives used, but also the entire village was driven to use all 56 walking plows. For example, when promoting manual thinning of seedlings, the Party branch called on Party members to lead farmers to implement manual thinning of seedlings, and the Communist Youth League branch also held a meeting to discuss how to mobilize young people to do a good job in this work. Director Liu Sannv (Party member, Communist Youth League branch secretary) thought: "Manual thinning of seedlings is good, but what if the team members don't agree?" She thought about it all night. The next day, Liu Sannv took the Party members of the team to first try manual thinning of seedlings on three mu of millet in Dongwa, setting an example for everyone. Who knew that the team members had opinions, some wanted to withdraw from the team, and some wanted her to compensate for the millet. But Liu Sannv was confident that this was what the Party called for, this was an advanced farming method, and it was guaranteed to be correct. She patiently explained to the team members, and also agreed that if less food was actually produced, she could personally divide less. After six or seven days, after a heavy rain, the manually thinned seedlings grew taller and fatter than those that were not thinned. Liu Sannv said to the team members: "These three mu of millet can produce at least a hundred catties more grain." The team members said to her with satisfaction: "This is your credit." The branch seized on this typical case and organized extensive propaganda. A total of 111 mu of millet was planted in the three agricultural producers' cooperatives, and 101 mu adopted the method of manual thinning of seedlings. The branch also promoted this method to the masses outside the team. Forty percent of the millet in the village was manually thinned.

Second, summarize the village's old advanced production experiences and educate team members and farmers to learn and promote them. During the summer manure accumulation, the branch held a symposium for veteran farmers and summarized the manure accumulation experience of Wang Zhongzhang's three brothers using green grass to fill the pens, chopping rotten firewood to ferment manure, and digging soil to cushion the sheds for livestock. After the summary, the team members of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives were organized to discuss, breaking the team members' mistaken belief that there was no source of fertilizer in the summer, and launched a warm summer manure accumulation campaign. The three agricultural producers' cooperatives added 12 new pigs, built 12 pens, dug more than 20 cartloads of pit mud, and shoveled more than 8,000 catties of green grass to fill the pens and chopped more than 3,000 catties of rotten firewood to ferment manure. Under the leadership of agricultural producers' cooperatives, 239 households in the village shoveled green grass to fill the pens and ferment manure. Li Daqi's family used green grass to fill the pens and ferment manure for 14 carts in one summer. This played a great role in increasing agricultural production.

Third, through the method of detailed accounting, team members are educated to strive to increase crop yields. Due to lack of rain in the spring and continuous autumn rain, most of the large fields in the village had reduced yields, and the late fields were not very good either, especially cotton. By early September, the cotton bolls had not yet opened. At this time, the branch decided to lead the team members and farmers to strengthen the management of late fields and increase the harvest of existing crops. However, many team members and farmers had a relaxed attitude. Some said: "The year's harvest is determined in August, and no matter how much you work, it won't help!" Others said: "The yield of the large fields has been reduced, and how much can the late fields help?" The director Sun Guizhi (Party branch secretary) first proposed at the team members' meeting, through detailed accounting: This year, there was excessive rainfall, and few cotton bolls opened, which will definitely increase the number of red flowers after frost. If empty branches are cut off and the heart leaves and diseased leaves are removed to allow the cotton to ventilate and transmit light, it can promote the early opening of cotton. According to the calculation of picking 30 catties more white flowers per mu and reducing 30 catties of red flowers, the price difference is 15,000 yuan, which is equivalent to increasing the production of 20 catties of grain; sweet potatoes are growing and irrigating, if you can do intercropping and mulching, cover the cracked sweet potato tubers with soil to prevent dogs, crows, etc. from destroying them, and prevent freezing. If you do turn the seedlings and lift the vines, so that the soil nutrients are concentrated on the sweet potato tubers, and irrigate the dry land in the ground seams, according to the calculation of each sweet potato growing two taels more, more than 2,500 plants per mu can harvest 150 to 60 catties more; then calculate all kinds of crops. Plus, the team can harvest 2,020 catties more grain by not losing grain and firewood during the autumn harvest. After such detailed accounting, team members recognized the importance of strengthening the management of late fields. After discussion, a specific plan was drawn up and acted upon. The branch promoted the accounting method of Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative to the remaining two teams and mutual aid groups, and the whole village enthusiastically launched a campaign to strengthen the management of late fields and strive to increase the harvest of existing crops, which achieved great results.
IV. Mobilize Women to Participate in Field Production,
    Solve the Difficulty of Lack of Labor in the Team
After the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives, due to the fact that each team operated sideline occupations, they felt the lack of labor during the busy farming season. However, a small number of male team members had the idea of ​​despising women, and a small number of women also lacked the habit of going to the fields to produce. The problem of lack of labor was not well resolved. The three agricultural producers' cooperatives had 54 female full-time and part-time laborers, and only 26 often went to the fields to produce.

In order to help solve the difficulty of lack of labor in the team, and at the same time to improve the economic status of women, the branch decided to mobilize all women to participate in field production. First, within the three agricultural producers' cooperatives, team members were organized to discuss how to enable women to participate in field production. Wang Wenxue said: "Women don't even know how to weed the seedlings, and they're just ruining the crops." Liu Bingchang said: "It's inconvenient to work with women; besides, it's so hot, it's not worth it if a few of them get sick!" Some female team members reflected the feudal idea that it was embarrassing to go to the fields to produce. For example, Li Shuling, who had never been to the fields, said: "It's embarrassing for women to go barefoot and bare-legged to weed, I'm not going."

According to the situation reflected in the discussion, the branch mobilized Party members and Communist Youth League members to lead their own women to the fields to produce, and educated male and female team members separately. For female team members, it was emphasized that only by participating in production can they improve their economic, political and family status, and achieve equality between men and women. It was clearly pointed out that participating in field production is glorious, and individual persuasion was carried out for different people's thoughts. For example, for female team member Cui Ruijun, the branch designated Communist Youth League member Liu Shujian to talk to her individually, which improved her awareness and actively participated in field production. Weeding, repairing cotton, pulling carts, and sending manure, she worked very hard. She said: "Liu Shujian opened my mind. Only by participating in production can I have a place in the family and achieve equality between men and women. I used to just think that my mother-in-law didn't treat me as a person, regardless of food and clothing, and was too lazy to work. Now I understand that I can only blame myself for not working, and I can't blame people for not treating me as a person. Besides, if the days get bad, I will starve too." Because she actively participated in production, her mother-in-law also changed her attitude towards her and asked her for advice on everything. The whole family was harmonious and united in production. For male team members, they were mainly educated by the deeds of female labor models from all over the country and the fact that Sun Yuemei, who cultivated 12 mu of land alone in this village, grew crops that were no worse than anyone else's, breaking their idea of ​​despising women. After most of the team members understood the idea, each team discussed specific methods for equal pay for equal work for men and women. Women quickly participated in field production, solving the difficulty of lack of labor in the agricultural producers' cooperatives.
V. Publicize the Achievements of Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives,
    Deepen Team Members' Love for the Team,
    Point out the Way Forward for Mutual Aid Team Members and Individual Farmers
During each production season throughout the year, the Party branch systematically publicized every achievement of the agricultural producers' cooperatives to all team members and mutual aid groups and all farmers in the village. This not only deeply educated the team members and deepened their concept of loving the team, which was conducive to the consolidation of the team, but also greatly promoted the village's mutual aid and cooperation movement and pointed out the way forward for mutual aid team members and individual farmers. The branch adopted the following three methods when publicizing the achievements of agricultural producers' cooperatives:

First, organize visits. This is the most effective method of publicizing the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives with living people and living things. Over the year, agricultural producers' cooperatives have gradually promoted various scientific farming techniques, used new-style farm tools, and demonstrated new achievements in each agricultural season. The branch promptly organized mutual aid team members and individual farmers to visit the site, and team members introduced their experiences and performed technical demonstrations, using living facts to educate team members and individual farmers. For example, the cotton of Sun Guizhi Agricultural Producers' Cooperative implemented the methods of staggered thinning of seedlings, staggered topdressing, and pruning and pinching, and the cotton opened early and was mostly white flowers; the cotton of Sun Dingfen and Sun Baoshan, who lived next door, did not prune well, pinched too late, and did not have staggered thinning of seedlings and staggered topdressing. Not only did it open very late, but it also had many stiff petals and few white flowers. After the visit, the branch promptly organized propagandists to publicize the reasons why the cotton on these two plots of land did not grow the same, and more deeply educated the team members and individual farmers. During the hanging hoe period, the branch organized team members and group members to visit each other's crops and organized discussions on the reasons for the good and bad crops. This not only exchanged production experience, but also made team members and group members further recognize the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The team members said: "I'm not afraid of not knowing the goods, I'm just afraid of comparing the goods." The group members said: "Agricultural producers' cooperatives use new methods of farming, and the crops are strong. I will join the team next year."

Second, absorb the leaders of mutual aid teams and propagandists outside the agricultural producers' cooperatives to participate in the meetings of agricultural producers' cooperatives. By absorbing the leaders of mutual aid teams and propagandists outside the agricultural producers' cooperatives to participate in the criticism and self-criticism meetings of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives, the branch made them see the team members checking each other's attitudes towards public property and learning new technologies at the criticism meeting, and felt that the production of agricultural producers' cooperatives had a reasonable division of labor, everyone discussed things, and everyone helped to correct shortcomings, which was of great benefit. Through their wide publicity, not only did it break the misunderstanding of some farmers that agricultural producers' cooperatives were difficult to manage due to the lack of unity, but also made many farmers realize that agricultural producers' cooperatives were the direction of their development. At the same time, the propagandists also learned some increase production methods and new farming techniques by participating in the meetings of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and they felt that they had something to rely on when publicizing.

Third, invite all mutual aid team members and individual farmers in the village to participate in the bonus distribution meeting of the agricultural producers' cooperatives. After the autumn harvest, the branch suggested that agricultural producers' cooperatives invite all mutual aid team members and individual farmers in the village to participate in the bonus distribution meeting. So that all team members, mutual aid team members and individual farmers can further understand the bonus distribution method of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives. At the meeting, Sun Guizhi reported the output of the team in 1953, with an average of 237 jin of grain per mu, an increase of about 30 percent compared with the average output of the original households in 1952. In addition, there was a sideline income of 13,970,000 yuan. The income of ordinary team members was 26 percent more than the income of the team members of Liu Futang's mutual aid group, who were strong and energetic in the village. Some public property has been accumulated within the agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many team members made reports at the meeting using the method of comparing the income of 1953 and 1952. Then, according to the principle of "more work, more gain, and dividends based on shares," the distribution was carried out on the spot, and the grain was sent to each household. The accountant announced the amount of grain of various colors that each team member should receive (this was decided after discussion by all team members), male and female team members loaded grain, weighed it, and pulled grain separately, and each received their due share.

Seeing this situation, the participating group members were very envious and said: "Joining the agricultural producers' cooperative, walking the socialist road, and dividing more grain, is really an economic and political improvement!" After the meeting, the branch organized Party members and propagandists to lead the discussion in each mutual aid group, using the income of agricultural producers' cooperatives to compare with the income of the group, and checked the past incorrect understanding of agricultural producers' cooperatives. Wang Dashui said: "I planted more than ten mu of land, and I have livestock and people, and each mu only produced more than 180 catties; Wu Fuqi has no livestock and only joined the team for one year, and he has harvested more than 1,000 catties of grain than me. I didn't want to join the team in the spring, I thought there were too many people and they didn't have the same mind, and it was not good, but in fact, even the people with the least income have made more than I have. Next year, I will definitely join the agricultural producers' cooperative." Mutual aid team leader Bai Xiuzhen said: "This comparison shows that our mutual aid team is far worse than agricultural producers' cooperatives. Next year we will also run agricultural producers' cooperatives!" Under the influence of the three agricultural producers' cooperatives for a year, coupled with the propaganda and education of the general line of the transition period, the atmosphere of "joining agricultural producers' cooperatives and taking the bright road of socialism" in the village is even stronger, and more than 200 households are brewing to join agricultural producers' cooperatives, of which more than 140 households have found their partners. On the basis of the grain purchase work, the branch is actively leading the masses to further expand and consolidate the agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    中共河间县东诗经村支部对农业生产合作社进行政治思想领导的经验
    中共河北省委宣传部
    河间县东诗经村，共有五百零九户，二千四百七十二人，有共产党员四十五人，青年团员四十一人，宣传员三十六人。从一九四五年起，在上级的领导下，党的支部就开始领导农民实行农业生产劳动互助。到一九五二年，全村已组织起五十个常年互助组，七十四个临时互助组。参加互助组的农户共计三百九十一户，占全村户数的百分之七十六点八强。一九五二年冬天，这个村的党员经过了整党，进一步地认识了只有逐步地实现农业的社会主义改造，才能使农民彻底摆脱贫困，享受幸福富裕的生活。接着便对农民群众进行社会发展前途和组织农业生产合作社的教育。结果有十四个互助组里的三十九户农民，组成了以孙桂启（党支部书记）、刘三女（党员、团支部书记）、刘福顺（村长）三人为首的三个农业生产合作社。一九五三年三个农业生产合作社每亩产量平均折谷二百三十七斤，超过一九五二年全村平均产量（一百八十斤）百分之三十一点六。产量的提高，充分地显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。党支部对于三个农业生产合作社所进行的思想领导，对于巩固农业生产合作社和提高产量是起了很大的保证作用的。其主要经验如下：
    一、启发农民建社要求，打破入社顾虑，有步骤地建立农业生产合作社
    建社之前，支部为启发农民建社要求，首先领导各互助组总结一九五二年的生产成绩与经验。互助组员在总结中都深刻地体会到土地产量的提高，是因为听毛主席的话实行了互助合作的结果。但是不少的组员对互助组已经感到不满足，要求进一步提高。如王文学互助组提出，由于全组土地是各户种各户的，有十二亩适合种花生的沙地没有种花生，结果减少了收成，再加上其他的土地，要是全组统一种植，就可多收三千多斤粮食。因此全组
  一致要求建立农业生产合作社。有的组员甚至说：
  “要成立不起农业生产合作社来，也就别再互助了。”许多互助组在总结时都认为互助组在生产中有许多矛盾不易解决，如耩地锄地时常发生争执，在劳力使用上不易发挥各人特长等。孙桂启互助组组员孙业勤提出：“咱们的油坊只能冬春闲时活动，不如多联合几家，实行农副业分工，使油坊常年不停。”经过总结，许多互助组都要求支部帮助建立农业生产合作社。
    互助组要求建立农业生产合作社的热情高起来了，支部便进一步领导各互助组酝酿建立农业生产合作社的工作。在县区干部指导下，支部将党员、团员和宣传员分片、包组、包户给群众讲解农业生产合作社的性质、前途和优越性，并通过互助组座谈会介绍了耿长锁农业生产合作社和邻村尹建丰农业生产合作社的经营管理制度及分配收益办法，发动大家讨论。经过一个多月的酝酿讨论，支部将群众的思想排了排队，大体可分为三类：
    第一类是积极要求建立农业生产合作社的。其中包括那些深深感觉到互助组需要提高的组员；还包括一部分妇女。因为过去互助时多是男人下地，妇女在家除做饭外，还得喂牲口铡草。建立农业生产合作社以后，牲口就可以伙喂，她们也就可以参加田间生产了。
    第二类是犹疑徘徊，即使入了农业生产合作社也是动摇不定的。如老中农刘俊春，劳力、畜力、农具都齐全，他想：“参加农业生产合作社后，我这牲口农具怎么办呢？”可是他又想：“和孙桂启互助这些年了，相处很好，这回分开也不得劲，还是入吧！”（他入了，可是不久又退出来了）。中农孙占劳，劳力不多，但牲口农具齐全，他想：“加入农业生产合作社后，有牲口农具的准得吃亏，不入吧，一到春冬两闲又没活干。”但他又想到：“孙明振也参加了合作社，他是干部，各方面都不在我以下，吃亏不光我一个人。”于是他决定加入农业生产合作社。李玉田在开家庭会时说：“俩口子还要打架分家呢，人多心不齐，加入了农业生产合作社万一垮了台，就不上算了。”可是他媳妇说：“加入农业生产合作社的都是些和咱们合得来的，如果不入，和别人插组又怕合不上来。”最后全家同意先入一年试试，不行的话，再退出来。
    第三类是对互助合作政策还认识不清，甚至把农业生产合作社当做是吃大锅饭，因而不愿加入农业生产合作社，或怕吃亏“等等再说”的。如中农孙春荣说：“加入农业生产合作社就是吃大锅粥呗，又得受罪，又得吃亏，把地掺合在一块，不论地多人少，地少人多都得一样吃。”刘福有开家庭会时，全家一致同意：“头一年办农业生产合作社，又得添买农具，收点粮食一还账就剩不了多少了，等一年再说吧！”
    针对以上不同的思想，支部通过群众大会、片会、互助组座谈会及个别谈话，反复地讲解了农业生产合作社的优越性和入股、计工、分红等具体办法，打破了种种顾虑。
    经过以上充分酝酿和教育后，支部决定着手建立农业生产合作社，向组员们提出愿意加入农业生产合作社的可以登记。以孙桂启、刘三女、刘福顺三个互助组为基础建立了三个农业生产合作社，参加的农民有三十九户。农业生产合作社建成后，支部一面号召大家努力把社办好，一面具体帮助暂时不愿加入农业生产合作社的户整顿巩固了互助组。
    三个农业生产合作社建立起来了，但如何巩固农业生产合作社，把农业生产合作社办好，并以农业生产合作社为骨干带动全村的互助合作运动和增产运动，乃是支部必须进行的一系列的工作。支部将参加农业生产合作社的八个党员、五个团员共十三个人（其中十二个是宣传员），分别编入三个农业生产合作社，以便通过他们对农业生产合作社进行政治思想领导工作。他们实行了“包干”的办法，在农业生产合作社的每一农事活动中，都发挥了引导社员前进的作用。
    二、加强集体主义和爱国主义教育，为巩固农业生产合作社而斗争
    农业生产合作社建成以后，社员的个人利益和集体利益，眼前利益和长远利益，农业生产合作社的利益和国家利益，经常发生矛盾。这些矛盾从社员一加入农业生产合作社起，就表现在每个具体问题上。对于土地，不但入社“四评”（评土地产量，评牲口和大农具的价格，评各个劳力应定的分数）时关心自己的土地产量评的高低，就是耕种时还关心自己地上的肥料上的多少等等。“四评”时，孙桂启农业生产合作社有五户，刘福顺农业生产合作社有六户都想把自己土地产量评高。如夏振海的地实际打不到一石，但他硬要评一石，社员给他评了四斗。在送粪时，刘振东怕把自己的地种瘦了，就想法往自己地里多上粪。孙占荣提出他的圈粪质量好，得上在他的地里。对于劳力记工，就要求给自己多记。如刘三女农业生产合作社的刘丙全，锄地本不如妇女，但硬要比妇女多记工。对于农业生产合作社的公共财产，在开始时社员们一般地缺乏自觉爱护的精神。如刘老四割麦时把磨镰刀的石头丢了，还说：“反正是大伙拿钱呗！”对于劳动纪律，更是缺乏遵守的习惯。如女社员李大娟不好好整理棉枝，别人提出了意见，她还生气回家不干。对于分配问题，虽然订有公平合理的办法，但有的社员总还想钻个空子占点便宜。如刘福顺农业生产合作社的赵长兴，他的地里种了七亩棉花三亩红薯，每亩棉能收一百九十多斤，红薯也长的不错，他一定要分他地里的一半棉花，李玉祥的三亩地完全种的芝麻，分配时他也硬要分一半芝麻；他们的理由是：“分配办法是地五劳五”。孙桂启农业生产合作社沥水淹了一部分地，地没被淹的社员说：“俺爷爷都没给治下洼地，现在有了洼地了！”“他们洼地淹了，不给他们要工钱就算便宜了，他们还要分东西！”另外，各农业生产合作社社员都严重地存在着企图占国家的便宜和发展资本主义的思想。他们看到邻村贩牛赚了三千多万元，就向银行贷款去贩牛。银行没贷给，就怨恨银行。赵易昌说：“不是为了占便宜，加入农业生产合作社干什么？”个别社员还滋长了不让搞商业就退出农业生产合作社的情绪。经营副业的农业生产合作社，更容易发生资本主义倾向。如孙桂启农业生产合作社开有油坊，武富祺就提出：“人家私人油坊都能偷税，咱农业生产合作社就不能偷税呀！”
    对于以上问题，支部采取了以下几种办法向社员进行教育，并加以解决。
    第一、耐心深入地向社员说服教育，并与具体解决问题相结合。在入社“四评”时，上粪时，分配收益时，支部都反复向社员讲明：农业生产合作社是统一经营，沾光吃亏，大家都有份，社员的利益和农业生产合作社的利益是一致的，必须大家都不耍尖头，才能把社办好，社办好了大家都沾光；又教育社员要把眼光看远点，比如淹地问题，不要光看到今年少打了粮食，还要看到洼地明年能多收麦子。另一方面，又通过农业生产合作社内讨论，提出具体的办法，解决所发生的纠纷。如对于夏振海评地的争执，经大家讨论按三年平均产量计算，评为五斗；在每块地里上多少粪，上什么粪，都由大家根据种植的庄稼来讨论决定。
    第二、发动社员民主讨论，克服窝工现象，改善经营管理制度。在春耕播种时，三个农业生产合作社窝工现象都很严重。刘三女农业生产合作社由于农业组长王文学缺乏计划性，每天晚上研究活时提不出具体意见，随着大伙乱哄哄，结果浪费人力很多，种一亩半棉花就去了二十四个人，一个早晨就能干完的活干了半天，并且记了二十四个工。孙桂启农业生产合作社也是每天因为集合耽误很多时间。在谷子间苗时，孙明晨很早就起来打钟，等社员集合齐时，又到吃早饭时候了，就回去吃饭，结果天快半晌了才下地。支部抓住这一问题，分别组织三个农业生产合作社的社员，讨论为什么窝工，窝工的害处，如何克服窝工现象等问题。讨论中，刘三女农业生产合作社的社员给农业组长王文学提出了批评和意见，最后经过全体社员讨论，通过“干活应每天由农业组长提出意见，大伙讨论通过执行”的办法，并改选了农业组长。支部又组织三个农业生产合作社再次学习了耿长锁农业生产合作社的记工办法。社员们讨论出：按每人的劳动态度、作活多少、活的好坏来确定工分，采取“死分活记”的办法，每天评工一次。（编者按：随着社内组织劳动生产经验的积累，应注意在评工计分时，力求避免开会次数过多或开会时间过长的毛病。）这样一来，不但解决了窝工问题，还提高了社员生产的积极性。第三、通过表扬先进批评落后的办法，教育社员爱护公物和遵守劳动纪律。丢了磨镰石的刘老四，在生产上也是指指动动的，他常说：“社长叫干么就干么呗！”经过宣传员刘吉祥对他进行教育，提高了觉悟，不仅生产积极而且经常向社长提供关于改进生产的意见。支部就请刘老四在社员大会上报告自己思想的转变经过。刘老四最后还说：“过去大伙批评我，我总认为这是大家对我有成见，现在想通了，大家是为了把农业生产合作社办好。”支部就组织社员讨论，联系检查自己的思想。从讨论中，大家明确认识了要办好农业生产合作社，必须人人关心农业生产合作社，爱护公物，积极劳动。最后，每个人提出了积极劳动，爱护公物的保证条件。
    第四、定期评选和奖励模范，树立榜样。三个农业生产合作社在全年都评选了两次到三次模范，共评选出十一人（其中有的人被选二次甚至三次）。评选模范是在大的生产季节完成后，召开全体社员大会进行。在会上除对当选的模范进行名誉奖励（以这为主）和适当的物质奖励外，对于爱护公共财产，干活勤快，有新的创造或积极学习新的耕作技术，能团结互助组员和单干农民，一贯遵守劳动纪律的社员，也都分别进行了表扬。通过评选模范，不仅使全体社员对自己的思想和行动作了一次深刻的检查，而且使全社有了活生生的学习榜样。如孙桂启农业生产合作社的孙潺，累活重活抢在头里干，并把油坊的两个牲口喂得胖胖的，真正把农业生产合作社当成了自己的家，三次都评为模范，社员都提出要向孙潺学习。
    第五、向社员经常进行爱国主义和社会发展前途的教育。说明小的利益应当服从大的利益，农业生产合作社只有搞好农业生产，才能多打粮食；多打了粮食，才能支援国家工业建设和抗美援朝的伟大事业。贩大牛、搞商业、偷税漏税、投机倒把等活动，虽然农业生产合作社里一时沾了光，但大多数人吃了亏，那都不是农业生产合作社应该干的。支部又在党内严厉地批判了某些党员的资本主义思想。经过这一教育，打消了某些社员单纯依赖政府贷款和搞商业的思想偏向。
    通过以上教育，使社员们在增强集体主义精神、爱护社内公共财产，自觉遵守劳动纪律、明确社会发展方向和提高爱国主义觉悟等方面，都有所进步，这对巩固和扩大农业生产合作社，奠定了思想基础。
  三、推广科学耕作技术，批判
      保守落后思想，尽一切努
        力提高农作物的收获量
    保证农作物增产，这是办好农业生产合作社的中心关键。河间县人民政府为了帮助这个村的三个农业生产合作社达到增产，派了技术站的干部前去推行科学的耕作技术。但在进行每一件生产改革时，都碰到不少社员的保守落后思想的抵抗。如在春耕时，技术干部建议社内使用新式步犁，社员夏振海却说：“我活了五十多岁，没使过这样犁，粮食比谁收的也多。”有的社员说：“步犁耕的深，一个牲口拉不动。如用两个牲口，把冷土都翻上来了，小苗不会长好，我看这二十九万元（指买步犁的钱）就当买了块废铁算了！”在号召密植时，多数社员说：“棒子是一弓三棵苗，留密了等着光吃甜棒秸吧！”号召夏季积肥，社员们认为没有肥源。秋收时号召为提高农作物收获量而斗争，社员们认为： “八月里就定了年景，再加劲也不顶大事啦！”总之，一切耕作都要按老法进行。支部针对社员的这些保守落后思想，用生动的事实进行了批判，帮助社推广了科学的耕作技术。他们采用的办法如下：
    第一、每推行一种新的耕作法，都先做出榜样，用实例去教育社员；并通过各种宣传力量向全村宣传，造成全村学习新耕作法的热潮。如使用新式步犁，技术干部首先帮助孙桂启农业生产合作社的技术研究小组进行试验，证明了一个牲口能拉动步犁，地还耕的平。经过支部宣传推广，不光三个农业生产合作社的五张步犁全使用起来，还带动全村把五十六张步犁都使用起来了。又如在推广手剔苗时，党支部号召党员带动农民实行手剔苗，团支部也开会讨论了如何发动青年搞好这一工作。社长刘三女（党员、团支部书记）想：“手剔苗好，但是社员们思想都不通怎么办呢？”她想了一夜。第二天，刘三女带着社里的党员，先把东洼三亩谷子试行手剔苗，做个样子给大家看。谁知社员有了意见，有的要退社，有的要她赔谷子。可是刘三女心里有底，这是党号召的，这是先进耕作法，保准没错。她便耐心地向社员进行解释，还约定若真是少打粮食，她个人可以少分一些。等过六、七天，下了场大雨，手剔苗的谷子长的又高又肥，比不剔苗的好得多。刘三女向社员们说：“这三亩谷子至少能多打一百斤粮食。”社员们满意地对她说：“这是你的功劳。”支部抓住这个典型事例，组织了广泛的宣传，三个农业生产合作社共种谷子一百一十一亩，就有一百零一亩采用了手剔苗的方法拣苗。支部又向社外群众推广了这一方法，全村有百分之四十的谷子实行了手剔苗。
    第二、总结本村旧有的先进生产经验，教育社员和农民学习推广。夏季积肥时，支部召开老农座谈会，总结了积肥能手王仲章弟兄三户利用青草填圈、铡烂柴火沤粪、挖土给牲口垫棚等积肥经验。总结后，组织三个农业生产合作社的社员讨论，打破了社员认为夏天没有肥源的错误认识，开展了热烈的夏季积肥运动。三个农业生产合作社新添猪十二口，圈十二个，挖了坑泥二十多车，铲了八千多斤青草填圈，铡了三千多斤烂柴沤肥。在农业生产合作社的带动下，全村铲青草填圈的就有二百三十九户，李大棋家一夏天就用青草填圈沤了十四车粪。这对农业的增产起了很大作用。
    第三、通过算细账的办法，教育社员为提高农作物的收获量而斗争。该村因春季缺雨，秋雨连绵，多数大田减了产，晚田也不大好，尤其是棉花，到了九月上旬棉桃还未开放。这时支部决定领导社员和农民加强晚田管理，提高现有农作物的收获量。可是不少社员和农民有松懈情绪，有的说：“八月里就定了年景，再加工也起不了多大作用！”也有的说：“大田减了产，光靠晚田顶多大事？”社长孙桂启（党支部书记）便先在社员大会上，通过具体算账，提出：今年雨水过大，棉桃开的很少，一定会增加霜后红花的数量，如果剪去空枝，打去膛叶和病叶，使棉花通风透光，能促使棉花早开，就按每亩多摘三十斤白花，减去三十斤红花计算，差价就是一万五千元，等于增产二十斤谷子；红薯正在生长灌浆，如能做到中耕培土，把裂缝的红薯块根部分培上土，能防止狗、乌鸦等糟蹋，还能防冻，再做到翻秧提蔓，使土的养分集中到红薯块根上去，旱地在地缝里浇水。这样按每棵红薯多长一两计算，一亩地两千五百多棵，就可多收一百五、六十斤；接着把各种作物都计算了一下，再加上秋收不丢粮食和柴草，全社就可多收二千零二十斤粮食。经过这样具体算账，社员都认识了加强晚田管理的重要性。经过讨论，订出了具体计划，积极行动起来。支部把孙桂启农业生产合作社的算账办法推广到其余两个社和互助组，全村便热烈地开展起加强晚田管理，为增加现有农作物收获量而斗争的运动，收到了很大成绩。
  四、发动妇女参加田间生产，
      解决社内缺乏劳动力的困难
    农业生产合作社建立后，由于各社都经营有副业，到农忙时便感到劳力缺乏。但少数男社员存有轻视妇女的思想，少数妇女也缺乏下地生产的习惯，劳力缺乏的问题，没有得到很好的解决。三个农业生产合作社共有女整劳力和半劳力五十四个，经常下地生产的只有二十六个。
    支部为了帮助社内解决缺乏劳力的困难，同时为了从经济上提高妇女的地位，决定发动全部妇女参加田间生产。首先在三个农业生产合作社内，组织社员讨论如何使妇女参加田间生产的问题。王文学说：“妇女锄地连苗全不识，白蹧蹋庄稼。”刘丙常说：“跟妇女在一块劳动不方便；再说这么热天，晒病几个更不上算啦！”部分女社员中则反映了下地生产丢人的封建思想。如从来没下过地的李书灵说：“妇女光脚裸腿的去锄地，不叫人笑话死吗？反正我不去。”
    支部根据讨论中所反映的情况，便一面动员社内党员团员先带动自家妇女下地生产，一面对男女社员分别进行教育。对女社员强调提出只有参加生产，才能在经济政治和家庭地位上提高，才能男女平等，明确提出参加田间生产是光荣的，并针对不同人的思想情况进行个别的说服工作。如对女社员崔瑞君，支部指定了团员刘书简经常和她个别谈话，结果提高了她的觉悟，积极下地生产了，锄地、修理棉花、拉车、送粪，什么活都很卖力气干。她说：“刘书简算把我脑袋说开了窍，只有参加生产，在家庭内才有地位，才能男女平等。早先光想婆家拿我不当人，不管吃穿，懒得干活。现在想开啦，怨咱不干活，不怨人家拿着不当人。再说日子过坏了，我也得挨饿。”婆母因她积极生产了，也转变了对她的态度，啥事也找她商量，全家和睦团结生产了。对男社员，主要是拿各地妇女劳动模范的事迹，和本村孙月梅一个人种地十二亩，比谁家庄稼长的也不次的事实教育他们，打破了他们轻视妇女的思想。在多数社员搞通思想后，各社又讨论出男女同工同酬的具体办法，妇女很快地就参加田间生产了，解决了农业生产合作社内缺乏劳力的困难。
  五、宣传农业生产合作社的成
      就，加深社员热爱社的观
      念，给互助组员和单干农
        民指出前进的方向
    党支部在全年的每个生产季节，都有计划地把农业生产合作社的每一成就，向全体社员和全村互助组以及全体农民进行了广泛的宣传。这样就不仅深刻地教育了社员，加深社员热爱社的观念，便于社的巩固，同时还大大地推动了全村的互助合作运动，给互助组员和单干农民指出了前进的方向。支部在宣传农业生产合作社的成就时，采用了以下三个方法：
    第一、组织参观。这是以活人活事宣传农业生产合作社的优越性的最有效的方法。一年来，农业生产合作社逐步推行了各种科学的耕作技术，使用了新式农具，在各个农事季节中，显示出新的成就。支部就及时组织互助组员和单干农民去实地参观，由社员们介绍经验，进行技术表演，利用活的事实教育组员和单干农民。如孙桂启农业生产合作社的棉花，实行了分期间苗、分期追肥和整枝打杈的办法，棉花开的早、也多是白花；地邻孙鼎芬和孙保善的棉花，没有很好地整枝，打杈也较晚，又没有分期间苗、分期追肥，不光开的很晚，僵瓣又多，白花也少。参观后，支部又及时组织宣传员宣传这两块地棉花为什么长的不一样的道理，更深刻地教育了组员和单干农民。挂锄期间，支部组织社员和组员互相参观庄稼，并组织座谈庄稼好坏的原因。这样不光交流了生产经验，还使社员和组员都进一步认识了农业生产合作社的优越性。社员们说：“不怕不识货，就怕货比货。”组员们说：“农业生产合作社新法耕作，庄稼就是强，明年咱也入社。”
    第二、吸收互助组长和农业生产合作社外的宣传员参加农业生产合作社的会议。支部通过吸收互助组长和农业生产合作社外的宣传员参加三个农业生产合作社的批评与自我批评会议的方法，使他们看到社员们在批评会上互相检查每个人对待公共财产、对待学习新的技术的态度，感到农业生产合作社的生产有合理的分工，有事大家商量，有缺点大家帮助改正，好处很大。通过他们再广泛宣传，不但打破了有些农民认为农业生产合作社人多心不齐，办不好的误解，而且使许多农民认识到农业生产合作社是他们发展的方向。同时宣传员由于经常参加农业生产合作社的会议，还学到了一些增产办法和新的耕作技术，在宣传时也觉得有了本钱。
    第三、邀请全村互助组员和单干农民参加农业生产合作社的分红大会。秋收后，支部建议农业生产合作社邀请全村互助组员和单干农民参加分红大会。使全体社员、互助组员和单干农民进一步了解农业生产合作社的分红办法和农业生产合作社的优越性。在会上，孙桂启报告了该社一九五三年的产量，平均每亩折谷二百三十七斤，比一九五二年原户数的平均产量增加了百分之三十左右，另外还有副业收入一千三百九十七万元。一般社员的收入，都比本村人强马壮的刘福堂互助组组员的收入多百分之二十六。农业生产合作社内并积累了一部分公共财产。许多社员都用一九五三年和一九五二年的收入对比的方法，在会上作了报告。接着按“多劳多得、按股分红”的原则，当场分配，按户送粮，会计公布每个社员应分得的各色粮食数目（这是经过全体社员讨论决定的），男女社员分别装粮、过秤、拉粮，收入各人应得的一份。
    参加会的组员们看到这种情况，非常羡慕，他们说：“入了农业生产合作社，走了社会主义的道路，又多分了粮食，真是经济政治都提高了！”会后，支部又组织党员和宣传员领导各互助组座谈，用农业生产合作社的收入对比本组的收入，检查过去对农业生产合作社的不正确认识。王大水说：“我种十多亩地，有牲口也有人，每亩只打了一百八十多斤；武富琪没牲口，入社才一年，就比我多收一千多斤粮食。春天我不愿入社，我觉得人多心不齐，闹不好，其实人家收入最少的也比我闹的多。明年长短要加入农业生产合作社。”互助组长白秀珍说：“这一比就显着咱互助组比农业生产合作社差远了，明年咱们也办农业生产合作社！”在三个农业生产合作社一年来的影响下，再加上过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，现在该村“参加农业生产合作社，走社会主义的光明大道”的空气更加浓厚了，酝酿入农业生产合作社的已有二百多户，其中一百四十多户已找好了对象。在购粮工作的基础上，支部正积极地领导群众进一步扩大和巩固农业生产合作社。
