    Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region Issues Loans
    to Support Farmers of All Nationalities in Developing Production
    The People's Government of Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province plans to issue agricultural loans of 132 billion yuan this year to support farmers of all nationalities in the region in developing production. The loans will be used mainly for the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and the purchase of fertilizers, followed by animal husbandry, agricultural implements, seeds, and handicraft processing production. To take care of farmers of ethnic minorities and farmers in disaster areas, the loans will be provided with low interest rates and deferred repayment methods.
    According to incomplete statistics at the end of February, water conservancy loans accounted for about 54 percent of the total agricultural loans. Water conservancy construction work has now begun in various places. In Liujiang County alone, from January to late February, 531 small-scale water conservancy projects were constructed, benefiting more than 51,000 mu of farmland.
    In order to take care of the scattered distribution of ethnic minority people and the seasonality of production, the distribution of agricultural loans in various places has adopted the method of "one evaluation, one distribution, and installment payments in batches and phases," which has been welcomed by farmers of all nationalities.

    桂西僮族自治区发放贷款
    扶助各族农民发展生产
    广西省桂西僮族自治区人民政府今年计划发放农业贷款一千三百二十亿元，扶助全区各族农民发展生产。农贷用途以兴修小型水利和购买肥料为主，其次是畜牧、农具、种籽以及手工业加工生产等。为照顾少数民族农民和灾区农民，贷款采取低息与延期还款办法。
    农贷中的水利贷款，据二月底不完全统计，已发放的数目约占全部农贷总数的百分之五十四。现在兴修水利工作已在各地展开。仅柳江县在一月至二月下旬，就兴修了小型水利五百三十一个，使受益农田达五万一千多亩。
    为了照顾少数民族人民居住分散的情况和生产的季节性，各地发放农贷时，都采用了“一次评议，一次发放，分批分期付款”的办法，受到各族农民的欢迎。（新华社）
