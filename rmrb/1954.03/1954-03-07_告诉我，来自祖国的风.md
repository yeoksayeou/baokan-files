    I am a sentry of the motherland's peaceful construction,
    Guarding the peaks on the Korean front,
    My eyes fixed on the southern edge of the demarcation line,
    My heart beating with the people of the motherland.
    The gentle breeze blows across the earth,
    Blows over my head
    Wind! Stop a while,
    Please tell me:
    "Are you from Beijing?
    Have you seen Chairman Mao?
    Have you seen the hardworking people
    of the motherland?"
    Please tell me:
   "Have you brought with you
    the smoke rising from the motherland's factories?
    Have you brought with you the songs of the motherland's labor competition?"
    Please tell me:
   "Can you carry
     the good news of the motherland's construction,
    Can you clearly describe
    the beautiful scenery of the motherland?"
    Tell me quickly,
    Wind from the motherland!
    If you can't finish telling me today,
    I'll continue listening tomorrow.
    I long to know
    the big and small affairs of the motherland,
    Even if you tell me:
    "The motherland has produced one more screw
     nail."
    That would be the same as saying:
    "My responsibility has increased by one point."

    告诉我，来自祖国的风
    蔡庆生
    我是祖国和平建设的哨兵，
    守卫在朝鲜前线的山峰，
    两眼注视着分界线的南沿，
    心和祖国人民一起跳动。
    和风吹过大地，
    吹过我的头顶
    风啊！停一停，
    请你告诉我：
    “你可是来自北京？
    你见过毛主席？
    你见过辛勤劳动着的祖国
    人民？”
    请告诉我：
   “你可曾带着
    祖国工厂冒出的烟？
    你可曾带着祖国劳动竞赛中的歌声？”
    请告诉我：
   “祖国建设的喜讯
     你可带得动，
    祖国美好的景象
    你能说得清？”
    快告诉我吧，
    来自祖国的风！
    今天说不完，
    明天我继续听。
    我渴望知道，
    祖国的大小事情，
    那怕你告诉我：
    “祖国又增产了一颗螺丝
     钉。”
    这就等于说：
    “又增加了我的一分责任。”
