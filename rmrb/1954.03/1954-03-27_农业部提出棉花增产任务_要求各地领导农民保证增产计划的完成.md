    Ministry of Agriculture Proposes Cotton Production Increase Task
    Requiring Leaders in Various Regions to Guide Farmers to Ensure Completion of Production Increase Plan

    [By Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, in accordance with the actual needs of industrial cotton and civilian wadding cotton during the period of the First Five-Year Plan, has deployed cotton production work for the future.
    By 1952, the national cotton planting area had more than doubled compared with 1949, the total output had increased by 191%, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output (1936) by 52%, and the average yield per mu had increased by 10 jin of ginned cotton. In 1953, the unit area yield of cotton fields exceeded that of 1952, but the planting area decreased by more than 6 million mu compared with 1952, and the total output also decreased somewhat. In the autumn of 1953, farmers planted wheat on many cotton fields. It is estimated that the reduction of cotton fields in North China, parts of Shaanxi, and Shandong Province, which are the main cotton-producing areas in the country, all exceeded 10% of the original cotton fields. If various regions do not promptly reverse the masses' thinking of reducing cotton fields, there will be a serious trend of continued reduction in cotton field area this year.
    The reasons for the reduction of cotton fields in 1953 were mainly that various regions paid more attention to expanding the area of grain cultivation in 1953, focusing on criticizing the phenomenon of blindly expanding cotton fields, but did not thoroughly implement the policy of stabilizing the area of cotton fields; secondly, the cotton purchase plans in some areas did not match the actual production situation, some places stopped purchasing cotton due to insufficient cotton purchase funds, and some areas had shortcomings in controlling cotton purchase prices and grain supply work in cotton-producing areas. These had a great impact on the cotton farmers' production sentiment. In 1953, some areas suffered natural disasters, and the grain harvest was not good. Some farmers changed cotton fields to grain fields to take care of food rations, which was also a reason for the reduction of cotton fields.
    In order to timely prevent the trend of possible continued reduction of cotton field area and strive for increased cotton production, the Central Ministry of Agriculture convened a cotton production work conference in October last year. According to the fact that China's cotton textile industry will greatly increase in the next few years and the civilian cotton will also greatly increase, it was determined that cotton production should increase the unit area yield by an average of more than 2 jin of ginned cotton per year from 1954 and expand the cotton field by more than 5 million mu. The meeting also believed that the main measures for increasing cotton production in the future are to further guide farmers to organize, improve cotton production technology, and increase the unit area yield; in areas suitable for cotton cultivation, the planting area should be appropriately expanded; various remote areas and mountainous areas should also appropriately increase a part of cotton fields to strive for local self-sufficiency in civilian cotton. The meeting also suggested that local party committees and people's governments strengthen their leadership over cotton production work, and thoroughly implement the task, guiding principles and policies of increasing cotton production in the future to grassroots cadres and the broad masses, combining with the publicity of the general line, so that cadres can establish an overall view that both grain and cotton must make every effort to strive for increased production, and help farmers from political and economic aspects to ensure the completion of the cotton production increase plan.

### 农业部提出棉花增产任务  要求各地领导农民保证增产计划的完成

    农业部提出棉花增产任务
    要求各地领导农民保证增产计划的完成
    【本报讯】中央人民政府农业部按照国家第一个五年计划期间工业用棉和民用絮棉的实际需要，部署了今后的棉花生产工作。
    全国棉花的种植面积，到一九五二年已经比一九四九年增加了一倍多，总产量增加了百分之一百九十一，超过战前最高年（一九三六年）产量百分之五十二，单位面积产量平均每亩提高了十斤皮棉。一九五三年棉田单位面积产量超过了一九五二年，但是，种植面积却比一九五二年减少了六百多万亩，总产量也同时减少了一些。一九五三年秋天，农民又把许多棉田种上了小麦，据估计，全国主要产棉区华北、陕西部分地区及山东省减少棉田都在原有棉田的百分之十以上。各地如不及早扭转群众缩减棉田的思想，今年棉田面积将会有继续缩减的严重趋势。
    一九五三年棉田缩减的原因，主要是各地在一九五三年对扩大粮食种植面积注意较多，着重批判了盲目扩大棉田的现象，对稳定棉田面积的方针却贯彻不够；其次是有些地区的购棉计划和实际生产情况不相适应，有些地方因为购棉资金不足，有时停止了购棉，有些地区在掌握购棉价格和对棉区粮食供应工作方面有缺点。这些，对棉农生产情绪有很大影响。一九五三年有些地区遭受了自然灾害，粮食收成不好，有的农民为了照顾口粮，把棉田改种粮食，也是造成棉田减少的原因。
    中央农业部为了及时防止棉田面积可能继续缩减的趋势，争取棉花增产，曾在去年十月间召开过棉产工作会议，根据我国棉纺织工业在今后几年中将有很大增加和民用棉花也将大大增加的情况，确定棉花生产从一九五四年起每年平均需提高单位面积产量二斤多皮棉，扩大棉田五百多万亩。会议并认为，今后棉花增产的主要措施，是进一步引导农民组织起来，改进棉花生产技术，提高单位面积产量；在适宜于种棉的地区，应当适当扩大种植面积；各边远地区、山区，也要酌情增加一部分棉田，争取当地民用棉的自给。会议还建议各地党委和人民政府加强对棉花生产工作的领导，把今后棉花增产的任务和方针政策，结合总路线的宣传，深入贯彻到基层干部和广大群众中去，使干部树立粮食棉花都必须尽一切努力争取增产的全面观点，并从政治和经济各方面帮助农民，以保证棉花增产计划的完成。
