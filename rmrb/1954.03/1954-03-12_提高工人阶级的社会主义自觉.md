    Raising the Socialist Consciousness of the Working Class

    Around the Spring Festival,工矿 enterprises in various regions generally conducted education on the general line of the transition period among the masses of workers. After this education, the socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers have been significantly improved. The attendance rate of workers during the Spring Festival this year and the completion of the national production plan in January and February were better than in any previous year. This shows that in our country's great period of socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is very necessary to universally and deeply educate workers on the general line in order to raise their socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm.

    The working class in our country undertakes a particularly important task in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. To accomplish this task, the working class must first have a high degree of political consciousness to fight for the realization of socialism. However, the socialist consciousness of the working class must rely on the constant education of its vanguard, the Communist Party. This educational work is of particularly important significance to the working class in our country. Due to the underdevelopment of industry in our country, there are very few industrial workers by blood. Their ideological awareness is uneven. With the rapid recovery and development of industry, hundreds of thousands of peasant small private owners and members of other non-working-class origins have poured and will pour into the ranks of the working class with the ideological consciousness of their original classes. This makes the composition and ideological situation within the working class in our country more complicated. In addition, since our country is still a multi-class country, many members of the working class in our country still maintain myriad connections with the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. The ideological consciousness of these classes inevitably still erodes and influences the thinking of the working class from time to time. The economistic thinking that currently remains within the working class, as well as the freedom and laxity of some workers, their failure to observe labor discipline, the phenomenon of some workers sending money home to buy land, lending money at high interest rates, and wanting to be small bosses, are all manifestations of the non-working-class thought within the working class and the influence of the outside world. In order to raise the consciousness of the working class and give play to the leading role of the working class in socialist construction and socialist transformation, it is particularly important to constantly carry out political education for workers.

    In the past few years, various enterprises have also explained to the broad masses of workers the basic issues of labor creating the human world, class and class struggle, and the realization of socialism being the law of social development, with class education and national vision education as the main contents. This education has played a significant role in enlightening the class consciousness of workers and improving their understanding of communism and the Communist Party. However, in the past educational work, many places did not link these two main contents together, or did not closely integrate them with the current actual situation in our country, and some were even sporadic and unsystematic. As a result, some workers regard political education as "the same old thing" and are not very interested. Some workers realize the important position of the working class, but do not know that they should play a leading role in production. Some workers know that socialism is beautiful, but mistakenly believe that it is a distant future event and cannot relate to their current tasks. In order to further strengthen the political education of the working class, the best teaching material at present is to widely publicize and explain the general line and general task of the transition period. The general line points out that the main material basis and leading force for building socialism is the country's socialist industrialization, which is mainly realized by the working class. It points out that during the transition period, it is necessary to promote mutual cooperation between agriculture and handicrafts and to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the leading force for realizing this task is the working class. It also points out that as long as all parties work tirelessly, our motherland can be built into a great socialist country in the near future. As long as we explain these issues well, we can closely link class education with vision education, the future prospects with the current tasks, and greatly improve the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the working class.

    Since the education of the general line is of such great significance, it should not be regarded as just a temporary task, but should be regarded as a long-term and important content of political work in enterprises. It should not only make the broad masses of workers understand the content of the general line, but also make it a force to improve the ideological level and production enthusiasm of workers. Through the education of the general line, the following three aspects of results should be achieved: First, it is necessary to truly improve the socialist consciousness of workers and possess the thinking and qualities that the leading class should have. This means drawing a clear line between the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, establishing a national concept and an overall concept, cultivating the spirit of selfless dedication and hard struggle, developing the style of criticism and self-criticism, and daring to fight against all conservative ideas and behaviors that undermine labor discipline, and so on. Since the working class is the leading force and main force in the socialist construction project, if our own thinking is not healthy, we cannot play our role, nor can we lead other classes to carry out socialist transformation. Therefore, strengthening the ranks of the working class and first improving the thinking of the working class is of particular importance. Second, it is necessary to truly mobilize all workers to give play to their creative spirit, improve labor productivity and production level, and play a leading role in production. This is the main sign of measuring the degree of workers' socialist consciousness. In order to ensure the accumulation of funds and the supply of technology for the industrialization of our country, to ensure the progress of basic construction projects and the speed of industrialization, and to ensure that the material needs of people's lives and production are met to the maximum extent under the existing equipment conditions, the most important condition is to rely on the working class to continuously improve production and improve labor productivity. This is the main task of the working class in our country in realizing the general line. If the effect of our education for workers cannot be manifested in production and construction, then this education cannot be regarded as successful. Third, it is necessary to make every worker truly understand the leading position and leading responsibility of the working class in realizing socialism. They should understand that they should not only do their best to fully complete and overfulfill the country's industrial production plan, but also actively lead the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. To this end, the working class should actively strengthen its alliance with the peasants, encourage the peasants' enthusiasm for production from all aspects, help the peasants improve production, and promote the mutual cooperation movement. We should overcome the arrogant and disdainful ideas of some workers towards the peasants; correct the behaviors of some enterprises and individual workers that infringe upon the interests of the peasants near factories and mines; oppose some workers unilaterally exaggerating the urban life to the peasants, blindly mobilizing relatives and friends in the countryside to flow into the cities, and shaking the peasants' production enthusiasm; educate and persuade some workers to correct the capitalist tendencies of buying land, lending money at high interest rates, and engaging in small businesses. In short, the entire working class should make its words and deeds conducive to the unity of workers and peasants, to industrial and agricultural production, and to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Do not say anything that is contrary to this, and do not do anything that is contrary to this. As for carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, it is an important task of the working class, especially the workers who are currently working in capitalist industry and commerce. Their responsibility is even greater, so they must be educated so that they can give full play to the leading role and supervisory role of the working class in the transformation of capitalist enterprises. Workers in capitalist enterprises should be more vigilant to prevent capitalists from buying off, enticing, corrupting, dividing, and other activities that undermine the unity of the working class.

    In the past period of time, many factories and mining enterprises have achieved remarkable results because they have paid attention to carrying out the education of the general line from the above aspects. However, many factories and mines did not explain deeply and thoroughly when carrying out the education of the general line, and even made some one-sided propaganda. When some factories and mines publicize the status and role of the working class, they often only talk about the high income of workers and the great value they create, and rarely talk about the current tasks of the working class and the necessity of ideological transformation, etc., which makes the complacency of some workers not overcome in time. When some factories and mines publicize socialist industrialization, they only talk about focusing on the development of heavy industry, but not about the corresponding development of other industries, so that workers engaged in other industries are not at ease in their work. When some factories and mines talk about the issue of the worker-peasant alliance, they only talk about the working class being the leading class, and rarely talk about how to realize leadership and the responsibilities that leaders should fulfill. They also rarely talk about the contributions of the peasants in the past struggles and their role in future construction, which has led to the further development of some workers' erroneous ideas of belittling the peasants. When some factories and mines explain the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, they only talk about the favorable aspects of carrying out this work, but do not clearly explain that serious struggles must be carried out in the work, which has made some workers relax their vigilance. Some factories and mines only explain how beautiful socialist life is when explaining the prospects of socialism, but do not talk about the need to continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle today in order to realize socialism, and so on. These shortcomings and deviations must be corrected in the future when further educating on the general line.

    In order to do a good job in the education of the general line and make it receive greater results, the following three issues must be paid attention to based on the existing experiences and lessons of various places. First, it is necessary to comprehensively and popularly explain the general line and general tasks, so that workers must not only understand the importance of socialist industrialization, but also understand the importance of the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce; they must not only understand that socialist society is the goal of our struggle, but also understand how to overcome difficulties at present in order to strive for the early realization of socialism; they must not only understand that it is necessary to improve the ideological awareness of the working class and strengthen the unity within the working class, but also understand the truth that the working class must form a solid alliance with the peasants. Second, in conjunction with the characteristics of the enterprise and the ideological situation of the workers, clarify the relationship between the completion of the national plan and the speed of accelerating national industrialization and the cause of accelerating socialist transformation, so that workers understand that doing their own production well is the greatest contribution to the cause of socialist construction and transformation, so as to guide their enthusiasm for socialism to the track of improving and raising production. For example, the state-owned Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant used to have poor product quality. When conducting education on the general line, they used specific examples to explain to the workers the close relationship between the plant's new products and the development of transportation, the strengthening of urban-rural ties, and the construction of heavy industry. They also used detailed accounting methods to explain the losses caused to the country by poor vehicle quality. The workers of Hou Liquan's group in the steel casting workshop felt very distressed after listening to these reports, and quickly checked and corrected the shortcomings, so that the product quality quickly reached 100%. Similar methods should also be promoted in other enterprises. Third, vigorously publicize the exemplary deeds and advanced ideas of advanced producers, set up living role models for the broad masses of workers to learn from, and enable them to consciously and gradually improve their political awareness and production technology to the level of advanced producers. For example, some factories and mines in the Northeast region simultaneously publicized the pioneering spirit of Wang Chonglun of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, who completed more than four years of work in one year, while publicizing the general line to the workers, and called on the workers to learn from him, which greatly promoted the technical innovation movement in various factories and mines. This is also a very important experience.

    The Party's general line during the transition period is the lighthouse illuminating all tasks and the driving force for promoting all tasks. Publicizing the general line among workers must become a long-term and fundamental ideological education work of the Party and the trade union in the enterprise. It is necessary to widely and deeply publicize the general line through daily production activities, and constantly enrich the content of the propaganda, so that the broad masses of workers can often play a great role in the cause of socialist construction under the light of the general line.

    提高工人阶级的社会主义自觉
    春节前后，各地工矿企业普遍地向工人群众进行了一次过渡时期总路线的教育。经过这次教育，广大工人的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性都有显著提高。今年春节前后工人的出勤率和一、二月份完成国家生产计划的情况，就比过去任何一年都好。这说明在我国进行伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时期，普遍深入地向工人进行总路线的教育，以提高他们的社会主义觉悟和劳动热情，是十分必要的。
    我国工人阶级在社会主义的建设和社会主义改造事业中，担当着特殊重要的任务。为了完成这个任务，首先需要工人阶级具有为实现社会主义而斗争的高度的政治觉悟。但工人阶级的社会主义觉悟，必须依靠它的先锋队——共产党对之进行不断的教育。这种教育工作，对于我国工人阶级说来，更有特别重要的意义。我国由于工业不发达，血统的产业工人很少，他们的思想觉悟水平本来就参差不齐，而随着工业的迅速恢复和发展，已经有并将要有成千成万的农民小私有者和其他非工人阶级的成员带着原有阶级的思想意识涌到工人阶级的队伍里来。这就使我国工人阶级内部成份和思想的情况更为复杂。此外，由于我国还是一个多阶级的国家，我国工人阶级中的很多成员，还和资产阶级、小资产阶级等保持着千丝万缕的联系，这些阶级的思想意识，不可免的还时常侵蚀着和影响着工人阶级的思想。目前残存在工人阶级内部的经济主义思想，以及有些工人自由散漫、不遵守劳动纪律，有的工人寄钱回家购买土地、放高利贷、想当小老板等等现象，就正是工人阶级内部非工人阶级思想和受外部影响的表现。为了提高工人阶级的觉悟，发挥工人阶级在社会主义建设和社会主义改造中的领导作用，经常不断地对工人进行政治教育，就显得特别重要了。
    过去几年来，各个企业也曾经以阶级教育和国家远景教育为主要内容，向广大工人讲解了劳动创造人类世界、阶级与阶级斗争、实现社会主义是社会发展的规律等基本问题；这种教育，对于启发工人的阶级觉悟、提高他们对共产主义和共产党的认识，都曾起了不小的作用。但是，在过去的教育工作中，不少地方没有把这两项主要内容联系起来，或者没有和目前我国实际情况密切结合，有的甚至时断时续，毫不系统。因此有些工人把政治教育看成“老一套”，兴趣不高；有些工人认识到了工人阶级的重要地位，但不知道应该在生产中发挥带头作用；有些工人知道了社会主义是美好的，但错认为那是遥远的未来的事，与自己当前的任务联系不起来。为了进一步加强工人阶级的政治教育，目前最好的教材就是广泛宣传和讲解过渡时期的总路线和总任务。总路线指出了建设社会主义的主要物质基础和领导力量是国家的社会主义工业化，这个任务主要是由工人阶级来实现的，指出了在过渡时期必须促进农业和手工业的互助合作和对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，而实现这一任务的领导力量是工人阶级，也指出了只要各方面努力不懈，在不久的将来，就可以使我们的祖国建成为一个伟大的社会主义的国家。只要我们很好地讲解了这些问题，我们就能把阶级教育和远景教育，把将来的前途和目前的任务紧密联系起来，就能大大地提高工人阶级的政治觉悟和劳动热情。
    总路线的教育既然具有如此重大的意义，因此就不应该把它只当作一项临时的任务，而应该作为企业中政治工作的长久的重要内容；就不应该仅仅使广大工人明白总路线的内容，而且应该使之成为一种力量，提高工人的思想水平和生产热情。通过总路线的教育，应该达到以下三个方面的结果：首先就是要真正提高工人的社会主义自觉，具备领导阶级应有的思想和品质。这就是要划清资产阶级和无产阶级的思想界限，要树立国家观念和整体观念，要培养大公无私艰苦奋斗的精神，要发扬批评和自我批评的作风，要敢于与一切保守思想和破坏劳动纪律的行为作斗争等等。因为工人阶级既然是社会主义建设工程中的领导力量和主力军，如果我们自己的思想不健康，就不能发挥自己的作用，也就不能领导其它阶级进行社会主义改造。因此，加强工人阶级队伍，首先提高工人阶级的思想，就有着特别重要的意义。其次，就是要真正地动员全体工人发挥创造精神，提高劳动生产率和生产水平，在生产中起带头作用。这是衡量工人社会主义觉悟程度的主要标志。因为要保证我国工业化资金的积累和技术的供应，要保证基本建设工程的进度和工业化的速度，要保证在现有设备的条件下最大限度地满足人民生活和生产的物质需要，最主要的一个条件，就是依靠工人阶级不断改进生产，提高劳动生产率。这是我国工人阶级在实现总路线中的主要任务。我们向工人进行教育的效果，如果不能在生产和建设上表现出来，那末，这种教育就不能算作是成功的。再次，就是要使每一个工人真正了解工人阶级在实现社会主义中间的领导地位和领导责任；使他们明白不仅自己应尽最大努力全面完成和超额完成国家的工业生产计划，而且还要积极领导对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作。为此，工人阶级就应该积极加强与农民的联盟，从各方面鼓舞农民的生产热情，帮助农民提高生产，促进互助合作运动。就应该克服某些工人骄傲自大瞧不起农民的思想；纠正某些企业和个别工人侵害厂矿附近农民利益的行为；反对某些工人向农民片面夸耀城市生活，盲目动员农村里的亲属好友流入城市、动摇农民生产情绪的作法；教育说服某些工人纠正购买土地、放高利贷、兼作小生意等资本主义倾向。总之，全体工人阶级都应该使自己的一言一行，要有利于工农团结，有利于工农业生产，有利于农业的社会主义改造，凡与此相反的话就不要说，与此相反的事就不要作。至于对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，更是工人阶级的一项重要任务，特别是目前在资本主义工商业中工作的工人，他们的责任更为重大，因此必须教育他们，使他们在对资本主义企业进行改造中，充分发挥工人阶级的领导作用和监督作用。资本主义企业里的工人更应提高警惕，防止资本家收买、利诱、腐蚀、分化等破坏工人阶级团结的活动。
    在过去这一段时间里，不少的厂矿企业由于注意到从上述各个方面进行总路线的教育，因而就都收到了显著的成效。但是，也有不少的厂矿在进行总路线的教育时，讲解的不深不透，甚至作了一些片面性的宣传。有的厂矿在宣传工人阶级的地位及其作用时，往往只讲工人收入多，创造的价值大，很少讲工人阶级当前的任务以及进行思想改造的必要等等问题，这就使某些工人中的骄傲自满情绪没有及时克服；有的厂矿在宣传社会主义工业化时，只讲重点发展重工业，而不讲应该相应发展其他工业，因而使从事其他工业的工人不安心工作；有些厂矿在讲工农联盟问题时，只讲工人阶级是领导阶级，很少讲到如何实现领导及领导者应尽的责任，也很少讲农民在过去的斗争中的贡献和在今后建设中的作用，致使部分工人轻视农民的错误思想反而更加发展；有些厂矿在讲解对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造时，只讲到进行这项工作的有利方面，而没有讲清在工作中必须进行严重的斗争，因而使某些工人放松了警惕。还有一些厂矿在讲解社会主义的远景时，只讲解社会主义的生活如何美好，而不讲为了实现社会主义，今天必须继续发扬艰苦奋斗精神等等。这些缺点和偏差，必须在今后进一步进行总路线的教育时加以纠正。
    为了做好总路线的教育工作，使它收到更大的效果，根据各地已有的经验教训，必须注意以下三个问题。首先，要全面地通俗地讲解总路线总任务，使工人既要懂得社会主义工业化的重要，也要懂得对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的改造的重要；既要懂得社会主义社会是我们奋斗的目标，也要懂得目前应如何克服困难，以争取社会主义的早日实现；既要懂得必须提高工人阶级的思想觉悟，加强工人阶级内部的团结，也要懂得工人阶级必须和农民结成巩固联盟的道理。其次，要结合本企业的特点及工人的思想情况，讲清完成国家计划与加速国家工业化的速度和加速社会主义改造事业的关系，使工人懂得搞好自己的生产就是对社会主义的建设和改造事业的最大贡献的道理，从而把对社会主义的热情引导到改进和提高生产的轨道上来。例如国营大连机车车辆制造厂，过去产品质量不好，在进行总路线教育时，他们用具体事例向工人说明了该厂新产品对发展交通运输业、加强城乡联系和建设重工业的密切关系，又用算细账的方法，说明车辆质量不好给国家造成的损失，铸钢车间侯立全小组的工人，听了这些报告后感到非常痛心，迅速检查和纠正了缺点，使产品质量很快地达到百分之一百。类似这样的方法，其他企业也应该推广。再次，要大力宣传先进生产者的模范事迹和先进思想，给广大工人树立学习的活榜样，使他们自觉地逐步把自己的政治觉悟和生产技术提高到先进生产者的水平。例如东北区有些厂矿在向工人宣传总路线时，同时宣传了鞍山钢铁公司王崇伦一年完成四年多工作量的首创精神，号召工人向他学习，大大地推动了各厂矿技术革新运动。这也是一个很重要的经验。
    党在过渡时期的总路线，是照耀着各项工作的灯塔，也是推动各项工作的动力。在工人中宣传总路线必须成为企业里的党和工会的长期的根本的思想教育工作；必须通过日常的生产活动，广泛地深入地宣传总路线，并不断地丰富宣传的内容，使广大的工人群众经常在总路线的照耀下，在社会主义的建设事业中发挥伟大的作用。
