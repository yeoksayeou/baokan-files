Xinhua News Agency report: Moscow, March 14th - As the clock on the Spassky Tower of the Kremlin struck six in the morning, and the radio station broadcasted the first notes of the Soviet national anthem to the world, the election stations in Moscow opened their doors. The elections for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR had begun.

Moscow citizens are to elect nineteen representatives to participate in the two houses of the Soviet—the Union Council and the National Council. Among the candidates for the Union Council from Moscow are Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR; Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR; Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; construction worker I. Shirkov; teacher Ye. Martyanova; lathe operator P. Bykov from a grinding machine factory; and the renowned biologist and academician of the Academy of Sciences, N. Tsitsin, among others. Among the candidates for the National Council is Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Defense of the USSR.

In the Leningrad Electoral District of Moscow, where Malenkov is a candidate, polling station number 60 was set up in a brightly lit school, and it was crowded with people even before voting began. At exactly six o'clock in the morning, the chairman of the election station's election committee, S. Shavenkov, an engineer from a machine-building factory, congratulated the voters and announced the start of voting. The first to cast their ballots were young female construction workers A. Plotnikova and L. Yegorova.

In another district of Moscow, the polling stations in the Molotov Electoral District, which nominated Molotov as a candidate for the Union Council, were also filled with people. Polling station number 20 in this district is located in the magnificent building of the Moscow Underground Railway Builders' Club. More than two hundred people cast their votes here in the first thirty minutes.

Brigade leader A. Chutkikh of the Red Hill Woolen Mill is well-known in Moscow. He is the initiator of the socialist competition to improve product quality, and millions of people across the country have joined the competition he initiated. The Kirov Electoral District, which nominated Chutkikh as a candidate, includes two large industrial areas of the capital. The polling stations were very lively, with many workers from the Red Hill Woolen Mill voting there.

Thousands upon thousands of people continued to come to the polling stations to exercise their civic rights—participating in the elections for the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    选民踊跃投票选举党和非党联盟候选人
    据新华社讯：十四日早晨，当克里姆林宫的斯巴斯基塔的大钟刚敲了六响，广播台向全世界播送第一声苏联国歌的时候，莫斯科各选举站打开了大门。苏联最高苏维埃的选举开始了。
    莫斯科市民要选出十九名代表参加苏维埃的两院——联盟院和民族院。莫斯科的联盟院代表候选人中有苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫，苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，建筑工人伊·希尔科夫、女教师叶·马尔佳扬诺娃，磨床工厂的车工帕·比科夫，著名的生物学家、科学院院士尼·齐津等人。民族院代表候选人中有苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联国防部部长尼·亚·布尔加宁。
    在以马林科夫为候选人的莫斯科列宁格勒选区，第六十号选举站设在一座灯光辉煌的学校里，还在投票以前，这里就挤了很多人。早晨六时正，选举站选举委员会主席、机器制造厂的工程师谢·沙文科夫向选民们道贺，并宣布投票开始。首先将选票投入投票箱的是年青的女建筑工人安·普洛特尼科娃和里·叶戈罗娃。
    在莫斯科的另一地区，提名莫洛托夫为联盟院代表候选人的莫洛托夫选区的投票站也挤满了人。该选区第二十投票站，设在莫斯科地下电车道建筑者俱乐部的宏伟大厦里。这里在头三十分钟里，就有两百多人投了票。
    红岗毛纺厂领班亚·楚特基赫在莫斯科是很著名的。他是提高产品质量的社会主义竞赛的发起者，全国千千万万人民参加了他发起的这个竞赛。提名楚特基赫为代表候选人的基洛夫选区包括首都的两个大工业区。投票站显得非常热闹，许多红岗毛纺厂的工人都在那里投票。
    成千上万的人陆续地到投票站来行使他们的公民权利——参加苏联最高苏维埃的选举。
