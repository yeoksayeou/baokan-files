    Enhance Artistic Cultivation, Strengthen Artistic Practice
    Key Points of the Work Plan of the East China Writers Association This Year
    The East China Writers Association held its first enlarged meeting of the Presidium on March 8th, discussed and approved the key points of the work plan of the East China Writers Association for 1954. In order to strive for the prosperity of literary creation in East China, the work of the East China Writers Association in 1954 mainly focuses on strengthening the organization of creative forces, exploring potential, and taking appropriate steps and methods to organize potential creative forces. Following the spirit of the general line of the state during the transition period, the association will continue to study the creation methods of socialist realism in a planned manner, focusing on the study of the realistic traditions of literature since the May Fourth Movement, the characteristics of literature and art, and the creation of positive characters. This study must be closely integrated with the creative practice of writers, combined with works, and unfolded discussions, so as to guide creation. In order to strengthen creative guidance and improve the theoretical cultivation of writers, literary and art criticism must be carried out correctly. Erroneous literary and artistic ideas and tendencies such as conceptualization and formularization must also be gradually corrected through study and criticism. At the same time, classical literature will be studied with emphasis; attention will also be paid to popularization work, and the reserve force of the literary and artistic team will be expanded and cultivated.
    The East China Writers Association will carry out the following tasks in 1954: organize writers to go deep into life in a planned and purposeful manner, to Korea and to factories, rural areas, water conservancy construction sites, etc.; assist members in discussing and revising works that may be published and performed this year; organize members to strengthen their studies in political ideology, and hold a "Special Topic Report Meeting" once a month; each creative group of the Creative Committee will formulate a business study plan quarterly, conduct a work discussion once a month, and cooperate with literary and art publications to conduct regular commentary work; assist the Shanghai Film Script Creation Institute of the Central Film Bureau in formulating a creation plan for 1954-1955, and strengthen the organization of film script creation; strengthen the literary and art commentary and research work of "Literary and Art Monthly" and "Liberation Daily", pay close attention to the works published in East China in 1954 and the problems in creation, and hold forums to unfold criticism and self-criticism; focus on assisting relevant parties to conduct research and collation of folk literature and art; help research and collate Chinese classical literary works, and encourage the creation of historical novels and dramas.

  Southwest and Chongqing Theaters and Troupes Set
      This Year's Performance Plan
    The theaters and troupes in the Southwest District and Chongqing City have initially set their performance plans for 1954.
    The Southwest People's Art Theater will perform a multi-act drama created by the theater's creative cadres based on the advanced group of factories, and will also perform the drama "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River" reflecting the socialist transformation of agriculture, and "Spring Flowers and Autumn Fruits" reflecting the "Five-Anti" movement. After performing the drama "Julius Fucik", the Chongqing Municipal Literary and Art Troupe will continue to perform the famous drama "Forty Years of Wishes" created by Li Qingsheng and four others from the troupe. The Chongqing Municipal Workers' Literary and Art Troupe plans to perform the drama "Red Flag".
    The Chongqing Experimental Sichuan Opera Theater will perform eight major repertoires this year, including "Beacon Tower" and "Waiting for Mother Beach", and will continue to collate six major repertoires such as "Hundred Flowers Terrace". The Victory Troupe plans to perform eight major Sichuan operas this year, including "Distinguishing Right from Wrong". The planned performances are all excellent repertoires that have been carefully revised. For example, "Waiting for Mother Beach" is a mythical story that has been circulating in western Sichuan for about two thousand years. After being adapted into Sichuan opera, it has been widely welcomed by audiences. (Xinhua News Agency)
  East China Opens Kunqu Opera Actor Training Class
    In order to promote the excellent classical art tradition of our country, the East China Academy of Chinese Opera specially established a Kunqu Opera Actor Training Class, which opened in early March. The training class has a total of sixty male and female students, most of whom are children with excellent learning and naivety, about half of whom are Young Pioneers. The few remaining old artists in the Kunqu Opera world, such as Zhu Chuanming, Shen Chuanzhi, Xue Chuangang, Zhang Chuanfang, Wang Chuanqu, Zhou Chuancang, and Yuan Chuanfan, all teach in the class. They all enthusiastically stated that they must unreservedly pass on the experience accumulated in the stage art life of the past thirty to forty years to the new generation.
    The schooling system of the training class is set at nine years. In terms of business training, in addition to respecting the excellent teaching methods of the traditional opera world, new teaching methods are also adopted to improve the teaching work. The students' learning process is divided into three stages. The first three years are the preparatory class, focusing on the basic training of opera (such as basic martial arts, basic movements, short plays, music, body movements, and limb exercises), and cultivating the ability to sight-read, listen and sing, and memorize scores. After the students enter the junior class, they will spend three years playing roles in literary or martial arts according to their artistic talents. During the junior class study period, there will also be internship performances and observation to enrich the students' stage activity experience. In the last three years of the senior class, the students will focus on stage practice and systematically study the history of Chinese opera and the performance art theory of the Soviet playwright Stanislavsky. Political and cultural courses also account for a considerable proportion of the entire curriculum of the training class.

  华东开办昆曲演员训练班
    华东戏曲研究院为发扬我国优秀的古典艺术传统，特创办昆曲演员训练班，已在三月初开学。训练班共有六十名男女学生，他们绝大部分是学习优良和天真活泼的儿童，其中少年先锋队队员约占一半。昆曲界仅存的几位老艺人如朱传茗、沈传芷、薛传纲、张传芳、王传渠、周传沧、袁传藩等都在该班任教。他们都热情地表示，一定要把三四十年来舞台艺术生活所积累的经验，毫无保留地传授给新生的一代。
    训练班的学制定为九年。在业务训练方面，除尊重戏曲界传统的优良的教学方法外，同时也采用新的教学方法，以改进教学工作。学生的学习进程共分三个阶段。头三年为预备班，着重进行戏曲的基本训练（如基本武功、基本动作、短剧、音乐及身段和四肢的锻炼），培养视唱、听唱、记谱能力等。学生升入初级班后，以三年的时间按照各人的艺术才能，分别扮演文戏或武戏的角色。初级班学习期间并将有实习演出和观摩，以充实学生舞台活动经验。学生们在最后高级班的三年中，将着重舞台实践，并有系统地学习中国戏曲史、苏联戏剧家史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的表演艺术理论。政治和文化等课程，在训练班的全部课程中也占相当大的比重。
