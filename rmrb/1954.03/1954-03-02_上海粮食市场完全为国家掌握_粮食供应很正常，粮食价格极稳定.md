Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st. - The grain market in Shanghai is now entirely under the control of the state. Rice is the main food for Shanghai's six million residents. Since December 28th of last year, the state has implemented unified management of rice. All 1,498 private rice shops in the city have been approved as consignment shops for the state-owned grain company, operating the business of consignment sales of rice entrusted by the state. According to regulations, each consignment shop submits a consignment plan for the following month before the 25th of each month. After the plan is reviewed and approved by the state-owned grain company, the grain is allocated. The consignment shops sell according to the unified listed price of the state-owned company. The state-owned company gives the consignment shops a certain handling fee, the amount of which is generally equal to the normal profit before the consignment sales. The consignment shops pay a certain consignment deposit to the state-owned grain company.

This measure is implemented on the basis of the state's planned purchase of grain. Since the implementation of the planned purchase of grain in various regions, the amount of rice and paddy transported to Shanghai from Jiangsu, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other places from November last year to January this year has increased by 62% compared with the same period last year. The Shanghai State-owned Grain Department, after possessing a strong supply force, began to implement the unified management of rice.

In the past two months, under the leadership of the Shanghai State-owned Grain Company, the grain supply network composed of state-owned retail stores, cooperatives, and consignment stores has provided extremely normal supplies to the six million citizens of Shanghai. Grain prices in Shanghai are also more stable. The price of standard japonica rice in Shanghai is still the same as the price on the first day of the unified management implementation. Since private rice shops have been incorporated into the state plan, grain speculation no longer exists. In the past, the selling price of each dan (approximately 50 kg) of rice in private rice shops was 1,000 yuan higher than that of state-owned companies. Now that private grain merchants have become consignment shops, the six million citizens of Shanghai avoid approximately 800 million yuan in exploitation by private merchants each month.

Rice was long regarded as a major speculative object by speculators in Shanghai before liberation. In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, grain speculators even launched a wave of grain speculation, causing great losses to the state and the people. When the country entered a period of planned economic construction, the People's Government, in order to ensure the stability of people's lives and the smooth progress of economic construction, implemented the general line of the state during the transition period, namely, to first carry out the socialist transformation of private grain merchants. The citizens of Shanghai generally support this measure. The legitimate consignment shop managers believe that they will not have to worry about the difficulties of funds and sources of goods in future operations, and business will be easier to do.

### 上海粮食市场完全为国家掌握  粮食供应很正常，粮食价格极稳定

    上海粮食市场完全为国家掌握
    粮食供应很正常，粮食价格极稳定
    【新华社上海一日电】上海市的粮食市场已完全由国家掌握。大米是上海六百万居民的主要食粮。从去年十二月二十八日起，国家开始实行大米的统一经营，全市一千四百九十八家私营米店被核准为国营粮食公司的代销店，经营国家委托代销大米的业务。根据规定，各代销店在每月二十五日前编送下一个月的代销计划，经国营粮食公司审核批准后提拨粮食，代销店遵照国营公司统一的牌价销售。国营公司给予代销店一定的手续费，其数量一般约等于代销前的正常利润，代销店则向国营粮食公司缴纳一定的代销保证金。
    这一措施是在国家实行粮食计划收购的基础上实行的。自从各地实行粮食计划收购后，去年十一月到今年一月间，江苏、湖南、安徽、浙江、江西等地运到上海的大米、稻谷，比上年同期增加了百分之六十二，上海市国营粮食部门在具备了雄厚的供应力量后，开始实行了大米的统一经营。
    近两个月来，在上海市国营粮食公司领导下，由国营零售商店、合作社和代销店组成的粮食供应网，对上海市六百万市民的供应极为正常。上海的粮食价格也更为稳定。现在上海标准粳米的价格，仍然是开始实行统一经营第一天的价格。由于私营米店已纳入国家计划的轨道，粮食投机已不复存在。过去私营米店每担米的售价都比国营公司高出一千元，现在私营粮商转为代销店后，上海六百万市民每月就避免了私商此项剥削约八亿元。
    大米，在解放前曾长期被上海的投机者作为主要的投机对象。上海解放初期，粮食投机商还曾掀起粮食投机风浪，使国家和人民受到很大损失。当国家进入有计划经济建设时期，人民政府为了保障人民生活的安定和经济建设的顺利进行，贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线，即首先对私营粮商进行社会主义改造。上海市民普遍拥护这一措施。正当的代销店经理认为，今后经营中不愁资金和货源的困难，生意好做了。
