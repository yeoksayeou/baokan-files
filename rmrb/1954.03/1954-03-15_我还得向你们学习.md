I Still Need to Learn From You
Liaoning Province, Model Agricultural Laborer and Family Member of a Revolutionary Martyr Song Chuan-yi

    When I saw the good news in the newspaper that the Korean People's Delegation was coming to visit China, my wife, my grandson, and my granddaughter-in-law were all overjoyed. Originally, when fighting the Japanese devils, the blood of Korean sons and daughters once flowed in China, and in the struggle against the American aggressors, the blood of Chinese sons and daughters flowed in Korea. Today, these flesh-and-blood friends are coming to visit us, how can we not be happy from the bottom of our hearts! My home is in Linjiang Street in Andong City, right next to the river, separated from you only by the Yalu River. I will never forget the day of November 8, 1950. That day, I was sitting on the kang eating breakfast when I suddenly heard the sound of bombs exploding on the other side of the river. Immediately, thick smoke mixed with paper ash and cloth ash rolled over to this side of the river. Seeing Korea being devastated like this, I was so sad at the time that I couldn't even swallow my food! Then, American planes continuously bombed our Andong City and dropped bombs in our vegetable fields. How can I forget these hatreds? So I did my best to support the Korean War. After the armistice, I participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. There were so many moving things I saw and heard. We once visited a 19-year-old Korean girl named Han Guizhi. Her home had housed four wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. One day, she was washing clothes for the wounded soldiers by the river when American planes bombed her house and it caught fire. At this time, she didn't care about her little brother crying in the house, but first rushed to rescue the four wounded soldiers. By the time she went to rescue her little brother, he had already been burned to death in the house. These things made me feel even more that the Korean people's contribution to China's security was too great. If it weren't for their heroic struggle and sacrifice, and their defeat of the American aggressors together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, how could we have today's peaceful and happy life, how could we transition to a socialist society!
    In China, everyone calls me a patriotic old man, but compared with your Korean people's heroic and tenacious spirit of patriotism, I am far behind! I still have to learn from you, and continue to strive for the construction of our socialist country, and for supporting the recovery and construction of your country. After returning to China, I first used the money I had worked hard for over the years—ten million yuan that was deposited in the bank—to purchase national construction bonds, and took the lead in participating in the newly organized agricultural producers' cooperative.
    Now, when I stand on the top of Zhenjiang Mountain, looking at the factories on the opposite side of the river in Sinuiju that are emitting smoke, and looking at the farmers cultivating the land on the opposite side of the river, I am really happy. I think that Korea cannot be conquered, and the lives of the Korean people will get better. At this time, I feel even more that China and Korea are like a pair of brothers. You will not forget China's Luo Shengjiao, and we will not forget Korea's Park Jae-geun. The blood of the heroic martyrs will not be shed in vain, our friendship will be consolidated forever, and our two countries will move towards prosperity and happiness. This is something that no one can stop or destroy.

    我还得向你们学习
    辽东省烈属农业劳动模范  宋传义
    从报纸上看到朝鲜人民访华代表团要来中国访问的喜讯，我和我的老伴，我的孙子和孙媳妇都乐开了。本来，打日本鬼子的时候，朝鲜儿女的鲜血曾经流在中国，在反抗美国侵略者的斗争中，中国人民儿女的鲜血又流在朝鲜，今天，这血肉相连的朋友要来访问咱们，咱怎能不打从心眼里高兴呢！我的家，就住在安东市紧靠江边的临江街上，和你们只隔一条鸭绿江。我永远也不能忘记，一九五○年十一月八日那个日子，那天，我正坐在炕上吃早饭，突然听得江对岸轰轰地响起了炸弹声，马上，夹着纸灰布灰的浓烟就卷到江这边来了。看到朝鲜受到这样的摧残，我当时难过得连饭都咽不下去了！接着，美国飞机又连续地轰炸了我们的安东市，还把炸弹投在我们的菜地里。这些仇恨，我怎能忘得了，所以我就尽我的力量支援朝鲜战争。停战以后，我参加了中国人民赴朝慰问团到了朝鲜，看到的、听到的、使我感动的事情是那样多，我们曾经访问过一个十九岁的朝鲜姑娘，名叫韩桂芝。她家里曾经住过四位志愿军伤员，有一天，她正在河边给伤员洗衣服，房子被美国飞机给炸起了火。这时候，她没顾房子里在哭喊着的小弟弟，而先去抢救那四位伤员，等到她去抢救小弟弟时，小弟弟已经被烧死在屋里了。这些事情使我越发感觉到朝鲜人民对中国安全的贡献太大了，要不是他们这样英勇奋斗，流血牺牲，和中国人民志愿军一起打败了美国侵略者，我们哪能有今天这样和平幸福的生活，哪能向社会主义社会过渡呢！
    在中国大家都称我为爱国老人，但是，要和你们朝鲜人民英勇顽强的爱国主义精神比起来还差得多哩！我还得好好向你们学习，为建设我们的社会主义国家，为支援你们国家的恢复建设而继续奋斗。回国以后，我首先把几年来辛勤劳动得来的钱——存在银行里的一千万元购买了国家建设公债，并且带头参加了新组织的农业生产合作社。
    现在，当我站在镇江山顶上，看着江对面新义州正在冒烟的工厂，看着江对面土地上正在耕作的农民，我真高兴。我想，朝鲜是不能征服的，朝鲜人民的生活会好起来的。这时，我更加感到中朝这两个国家就像一对亲兄弟，你们忘不了中国的罗盛教，我们也忘不了朝鲜的朴在根。英雄烈士们的血不会白流，我们的友谊将永远巩固，我们两个国家都要走向繁荣和幸福，这是谁也阻挡不了，破坏不了的。
