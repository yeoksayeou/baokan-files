    The Second National Procuratorial Work Conference convened by the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government opened in Beijing on the 17th.
    The main tasks of this conference are, according to the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, to summarize past work and convey and discuss the current guidelines and tasks of procuratorial work, to unify professional thinking and work steps, and to study and resolve a number of necessary and feasible procuratorial business systems, so as to ensure the smooth realization of the general line and general task from the perspective of procuratorial work.
    Li Liuru, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said in his opening speech: Our conference is convened under the beacon of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period and in the second year of the state's first five-year construction plan. Under such circumstances, strengthening the construction of procuratorial work and using the people's democratic legal system to continue to eliminate reactionary remnant forces and punish various illegal and criminal elements who endanger the socialist construction cause from the perspective of procuratorial work, in order to ensure the smooth realization of the general line and general task, has become an important task in the current procuratorial work. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the current guidelines and tasks of procuratorial work based on the spirit of the general line and general task, which is the primary issue that this conference should discuss in detail. Secondly, because the people's procuratorial organs are still very young and various procuratorial business systems have not yet been fully established, in order to make the people's procuratorial organs a sharp weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship and complete the above tasks, it is necessary to study and establish and improve certain procuratorial business systems at this conference, according to the current needs and possibilities. Li Liuru pointed out that in the past few years, under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, as well as the party and government organs at all levels, with the support of the broad masses and the efforts of all procuratorial cadres, procuratorial work has achieved certain achievements and experience, although there are still some shortcomings. However, we must understand that experience is gained and enriched from work practice, and is concentrated from the bottom up. We should cherish and value these experiences, summarize them in a planned and systematic way, so as to further improve leadership and work. At the same time, since no special business conference has been held in the past few years, a number of problems have accumulated, and these problems should be solved appropriately and correctly as far as possible under the necessary and possible conditions.
    The conference was followed by Gao Kelin, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, who gave a report on "Summary of Past Procuratorial Work and Guidelines and Tasks of Future Procuratorial Work."
    In the past few years, especially in 1953, the people's procuratorial work has achieved considerable results. In 1953, the people's procuratorates above the provincial (municipal) level focused on carrying out procuratorial work in industrial and mining enterprises, and investigated and dealt with illegal and criminal cases such as the destruction of production and construction by remaining counter-revolutionary elements and major accidents caused by a small number of employees due to passive怠工, negligence of duty, ensuring the smooth progress of production in industrial and mining enterprises. For example, the people's procuratorates at all levels in Northeast China investigated 163 illegal cases in industrial and mining enterprises, basic construction and other departments last year. The people's procuratorates in various regions also focused on investigating the "five poisons" crimes of some illegal private industrialists and merchants. According to the statistics of the people's procuratorates in 18 counties and cities such as Baoji in the Northwest region, a total of 997 "five poisons" cases were investigated. In some areas, after the procuratorial organs focused on reporting and prosecuting private merchants who were seriously evading taxes, other private merchants who were evading taxes paid their taxes one after another, thus ensuring the country's income. In the policy of state implementation of planned purchase and planned supply of grain, the people's procuratorates at all levels also participated in this work with full force or main force, and investigated and dealt with profiteers who sabotaged the grain policy and counter-revolutionary elements who took the opportunity to carry out sabotage. In the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations, the people's procuratorates at all levels seized typical cases that seriously infringed on the democratic rights of the working people and hindered agricultural production, and carried out inspections conscientiously, greatly improving the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses. After the Fujian Provincial People's Procuratorate investigated and dealt with the case of bad elements in Bancha Township, Minqing County, framing the masses and forcing people to death, and due to the cooperation of other work, the number of organized farmers in the whole township increased sharply from 24.6% of the number of farmers to 52.3%, and a warm production manure accumulation campaign was launched. In the general election work, the people's procuratorates at all levels also dispatched cadres to participate in the local election work, and supervised the correct trial of cases related to voter qualifications by the people's courts. Last year, the people's procuratorates at all levels, in cooperation with the public security departments and the people's courts, started from helping to clear up backlog cases, handling mass petitions, inspecting prisons and labor reform teams, and conscientiously checked and corrected cases that were improperly handled in the past, and won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses.
    The conference was attended by the Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Chief and Deputy Procurators-General of the People's Procuratorates of major administrative regions and provinces (municipalities), as well as some of the Chief and Deputy Procurators-General of the People's Procuratorates of special regions, counties, and industrial and mining areas, totaling 140 people. Among the Chief and Deputy Procurators-General at all levels who attended the meeting, there were also two ethnic minority cadres and five female cadres.

    全国检察工作会议在北京开幕
    【新华社十七日讯】中央人民政府最高人民检察署所召开的第二届全国检察工作会议于十七日在北京开幕。
    这次会议的主要任务是根据国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，总结过去的工作和传达讨论当前检察工作的方针任务，统一业务思想和工作步骤，并研究和解决若干必要和可行的检察业务制度，以从检察工作方面保障总路线总任务的顺利实现。
    最高人民检察署副检察长李六如在致开幕词中说：我们的会议，是在国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的灯塔照耀下和国家进入第一个五年建设计划第二年的时候召开的。在这样的情况下，加强检察工作的建设，运用人民民主的法制从检察工作方面继续肃清反动残余势力和惩治各种危害社会主义建设事业的违法犯罪分子，以保障总路线总任务的顺利实现，已成为当前检察工作中的重要任务。因此，必须根据总路线总任务的精神，确定当前检察工作的方针任务，这是这次会议应当详加讨论的首要课题。其次，由于人民检察机关还很年青，各种检察业务制度还未能完全建立起来，为要使人民检察机关成为人民民主专政的锐利武器，完成上述任务，就需要在这次会议上，按目前的必需和可能，研究建立和健全某些检察业务制度。李六如指出，过去几年来检察工作在中央和毛主席以及各级党政机关的领导下，在广大群众的支援和全体检察干部的努力下，虽还有些缺点，但已取得一定的成绩和经验。然而，我们要懂得经验是从工作实践中获得和充实起来的，是从下而上集中起来的。我们应该宝贵和重视这些经验，有计划有系统地总结起来，达到进一步改进领导和工作的目的。同时，由于几年来没有开过专门的业务会议，存积了若干问题，应该在必须和可能条件下，尽可能的求得适当的正确的解决这些问题。
    会议接着由最高人民检察署副检察长高克林在会上作了“关于过去检察工作的总结和今后检察工作方针任务的报告”。
    几年来，尤其在一九五三年中，人民检察工作取得了相当的成绩。在一九五三年中，各省（市）以上的人民检察署有重点地开展了工矿企业中的检察工作，检察了残余反革命分子破坏生产建设以及少数职工因消极怠工、玩忽职守而造成重大事故等违法犯罪案件，保障了工矿企业生产的顺利进行。如东北各级人民检察署在去年检察了工矿企业、基本建设等部门违法案件一百六十三件。各地人民检察署还有重点地检察了一些不法私营工商业者的“五毒”罪行。据西北地区宝鸡等十八个县、市人民检察署统计，共检察了“五毒”案件九百九十七件。有的地区在检察机关将偷税漏税严重的私商有重点地检举起诉以后，其他偷税漏税的私商就纷纷补缴了税款，因而保证了国家的收入。在国家实行粮食计划收购和计划供应的政策中，各级人民检察署又以全力或主要力量参加了这一工作，检察处理了破坏粮食政策的奸商和乘机进行破坏的反革命分子。在反对官僚主义、反对命令主义、反对违法乱纪的斗争中，各级人民检察署都抓住严重侵害劳动人民民主权利和妨害农业生产的典型案件，认真进行了检察，大大提高了群众的政治积极性和生产热情。福建省人民检察署检察处理了闽清县坂茶乡坏分子陷害群众逼死人命的案件后，并由于其他工作的配合，全乡组织起来的农民从农户数百分之二十四点六，激增到百分之五十二点三，展开了热烈的生产积肥运动。在普选工作中，各级人民检察署还抽派干部参加了当地的选举工作，监督人民法庭对有关选民资格诉讼案件的正确审理。去年，各级人民检察署还配合公安部门和人民法院从帮助清理积案、处理群众申诉、检查监所、劳改队等方面入手，认真检查纠正了过去处理不当的案件，获得广大群众的热烈拥护。
    出席这次会议的有最高人民检察署副检察长、各大行政区和省（市）人民检察署正副检察长，还有部分的专区、县和工矿区人民检察署的正副检察长等共一百四十人。在出席的各级正副检察长中还有兄弟民族干部二人，妇女干部五人。
