The Practices of Grassroots Elections in Chaoyang Township, Taigu County, Shanxi Province
Zhang Shubi, Leader of the Taigu County Chaoyang Township Election Work Group

After grassroots election work in Chaoyang Township, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, not only were the achievements of the general line publicity and education in the previous stage further consolidated and expanded politically and organizationally, but the original backwardness of the township was fundamentally changed, powerfully promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and spring plowing preparations throughout the township.

  Starting from Production, Combining with Political Accounting, and Deeply Mobilizing the Masses

Because the Party and government leaders of this township had not focused closely on production for a long time in the past, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the township was very undeveloped, forming a pattern of "group in spring, scatter in summer, collapse in autumn." After the publicity and education of the general line in the previous stage, the masses recognized and believed that only through the road of mutual aid and cooperation could everyone become rich, so they actively sought partners to consolidate and establish new mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. The work group, in response to the demands of the masses, started the election work by leading production and consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations. First, it convened an enlarged meeting of Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and activists throughout the township to identify the main reasons for the collapse of various mutual aid teams last year: lack of a certain plan and system, poor arrangement of work, and everyone rushing to do their own work when busy. Then, these situations were studied at the meeting of mutual aid team leaders, and solutions were formulated. For example, when cutting wheat and hoeing millet, teams should be categorized, work and produce should be evaluated, and losses should be shared in the event of disasters. This enhanced the masses' confidence in mutual aid production, and many masses spontaneously brewed the establishment of mutual aid teams. Within four or five days, the whole township consolidated and developed sixty-three mutual aid teams, four labor exchange groups, and one agricultural production cooperative. Many mutual aid teams also formulated annual production plans. The masses actively prepared for spring plowing by turning manure, accumulating fertilizer, chopping firewood, and accumulating fuel.

  While the masses were actively organizing mutual aid teams and formulating this year's production plans, the work group raised the question of "How can we do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation and achieve the production increase plan," inspiring the masses to discuss. After discussion, the masses unanimously believed that "if there are no good cadres to lead, even if the production plan is well formulated, it will fail," thus naturally combining the general election and production in the masses' minds and actions. At the same time, the work group also used mass meetings, small-scale forums, and door-to-door publicity to guide the masses to recall and compare the different political status and different economic lives of the people under the two different regimes in the old and new societies. In the comparison, the method of using local materials was adopted, seizing the living people and events that had the deepest impact on the masses to educate them, and the effect was great. The people of the whole township recalled the sinful facts of landlord Li Xun as the village head before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and everyone was indignant. Farmer Wang Liandong said: "In the old society, the poor had no way to live. When Li Xun was the village head, he swaggered around the street with a banana fan all day long. If he saw someone who didn't please him, he would pull them to the village office for 'severe punishment.' Women could not stand on the street, and people who did not wear long robes and gowns could not enter the temple." Yang Erzi said: "Before the War of Resistance, one time the deputy village head Wu Houzi's family lost wheat, and Li Xun falsely accused me of stealing it, pulled my mother and three children to the temple and beat us half to death, and even said he wanted to bury us alive! It's a pity that my younger brother Xizi died within three days of returning home." Ji Laiyi said: "During the 'Second War Zone' (referring to the rule of Yan Xishan's bandit gang), the village head Wang Jixiang governed the village so that the east end could not reach the west end. One time I went from the east end to the west end without a travel permit, Wang Jixiang said I was 'disguised' and immediately arrested me and beat me forty big boards." The masses of the whole township realized more profoundly that the regime of the old society was a tool to oppress the people, and at the same time deeply felt that today's regime is truly the guarantee of the people's happy life. Everyone could clearly see that after liberation, the government supported production. In Chaoyang Village alone, thirteen new water wells were drilled, thirty old wells were repaired, and twenty-seven waterwheels were bought, turning more than 700 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and repairing canals to irrigate more than 830 mu, so the land yield increased year by year. After the comparison, the farmers realized the importance of holding power. Wang Xiaoer said: "If a family has a good housekeeper, life can be good; if a group has a good leader, the mutual aid group can be consolidated; if a township has a good township head, he can do good things for us, and the people of the whole township can live a good life. The whole country has our Chairman Mao, and we have today's good life." Therefore, the masses unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in the general election and grasp the "knife handle."

  Organize Mass Population Registration and Voter Qualification Review

After the masses were fully mobilized, the township election committee was established. According to the population and residential situation of the whole township, eleven electoral districts were divided. Each electoral district determined three people each for population investigation and voter qualification review to carry out the work separately. The work group, on the one hand, trained these personnel, explained the policies and specific practices; on the other hand, publicized the purpose and significance of population investigation and voter qualification review to the masses. At the beginning, because some people had previously concealed their age, and now they were afraid of being punished for reporting the truth, and some young girls wanted to get married early, the age registration was not accurate. The work group conducted persuasion and explanation on these ideological concerns and mobilized the masses to automatically correct their ages at the constituency meetings. Farmer Liu Peimao said: "In the past, in order not to let the enemy see the railway, I over-reported my age by one year. Now the railway has become the people's own, what am I afraid of? I must truthfully report my age." Yu Huang's wife said: "In the past, I reported my age as fifty-five when I was fifty years old, so I made five fewer pairs of shoes for the 'Second War Zone.' This time I want to change my age back." The work group promptly seized these examples and praised them, so more than 320 people in the township corrected their previously concealed ages. In order to do a good job in population registration, each household was notified in advance of the time and place of registration, and the masses were organized to register on time, so that "people do not wait for the station, and the station does not wait for people."

  While conducting population investigation, the voter qualifications were reviewed, voter registration was carried out, and voter certificates were issued. The results of the review were posted and announced to the voters. The reasons were also explained to those who were not issued voter certificates. In order to ensure that no citizen was wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, and that no reactionary elements or members of the landlord class who had not changed their status illegally seized the solemn right to vote, the work group launched a mass voter qualification review. At the beginning, the masses had paralyzing thoughts, such as saying: "The review team's review is quite appropriate!" "Let's forget about the past, don't provoke people!" The work group mobilized the masses to discuss why voter qualifications should be reviewed, and what harm would it do if bad people mixed into the people's ranks. After deliberation and discussion, the masses revealed many problems. For example, the Fifth Electoral District revealed that Li Siwa had colluded with landlord Li Erwa in the past to oppress the masses, rape women, and seek wealth and kill people; the Sixth Electoral District revealed that Yan Maiquan, the captain of the civil defense army in the "Second War Zone," had forced more than 20 young people to leave; the Seventh Electoral District revealed the counter-revolutionary facts of Ji Sanwa, the pseudo-soldier and farmer captain. The masses demanded that they be deprived of their right to vote and placed under control. At the same time, some people who had committed minor crimes and had shown repentance were inspected, and everyone agreed to give them the right to vote. The masses also put forward specific opinions on which landlords should change their status and which should not. In the review, the "leftist" emotions of some masses who advocated that some people who usually had problems in their style of work should also be denied the right to vote were also corrected. The election committee, based on the opinions of the masses, made a decision after careful and meticulous study and review, reported it to the county people's government for approval, and then convened a voter qualification review summary meeting in each natural village to announce the results of the handling. The list of those who should be deprived of political rights and their criminal facts were announced, and those who should be controlled were also issued control notices at the same time. The landlords who should change their status and those who should be relieved of control were announced to be released from control and issued voter certificates on the spot. After doing this, the whole township was relieved, further improving the masses' awareness of loving the people's democratic regime, clarifying the line between the enemy and us, strengthening the unity within the people, and laying the foundation for brewing the nomination of representative candidates.

  Fully Develop Democracy and Carefully Select Satisfactory Representatives

On the basis of the successful conclusion of the voter qualification review, the election committee studied the number of representatives in each electoral district and how to lead the brewing of representative candidates, and then first organized voters to discuss: what kind of people should be elected as representatives. The conditions put forward by the voters were: people who are upright, selfless, can contact the masses, work actively, and resolutely lead the masses on the socialist road. They also put forward the slogan of "coarse sieve, fine sieve, and select our most satisfactory representatives." Farmer Kong Erhuo said: "See clearly and aim accurately to elect good representatives." On this basis, voters individually or jointly nominated the people they supported. The election committee also mobilized voters to discuss and compare the nominees. In the initial comparison, some people only mentioned the advantages of the nominees, not the disadvantages; others only looked at cultural level, eloquence, or fewer children, without dragging down (mainly referring to women), ignoring ideological awareness and other aspects. In response to this situation, the election committee induced everyone to conduct a comprehensive analysis and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the nominees, so the voters criticized some of the nominees. For example, after raising some shortcomings such as selfishness, arrogance, and insufficient contact with the masses to the Party branch secretary Shi Mingzhen, Shi Mingzhen made a self-criticism and expressed his determination to correct them. The masses said: It is not terrible for cadres to have shortcomings, as long as they can correct them. When mentioning Party member and cadre Ji Zhenming, the masses said that his position was unstable and he had shielded counter-revolutionary elements, and he must not be elected. At the same time, everyone also praised good cadres such as Youth League branch secretary Li Qiugui and credit cooperative director Meng Zhaoliang. After full deliberation by the masses, the election committee invited representatives from local organizations and people's organizations such as the Communist Party, the Youth League, local armed forces, and women to jointly negotiate and, based on the opinions of the masses, formally proposed a list of representative candidates and announced it to the voters, and at the same time determined the election date and address and prepared for the election.

  In order to hold a good election meeting, each voter group learned in advance about the home or out-of-home situation of voters in the group, and specifically helped voters solve difficulties such as watching the door and taking care of children during the meeting. On the day of the Spring Festival, the election meeting was held. In the eleven electoral districts of the whole township, 96.19% of the total number of voters participated in the election. A total of thirty-five representatives were elected, including twenty-eight men and seven women; including twelve Party members and two Youth League members. The masses were very satisfied with the representatives they elected. Farmer Meng was happy and said: "We elected good representatives to lead us on the socialist road and make us all live a happy and prosperous life."

  Convene the Township People's Congress and Pass Resolutions to Promote Production

After the representatives were elected, the first township people's congress was convened. Before the township people's congress was convened, the election committee studied the content, time, and place of the meeting, and notified the representatives to go deep into each household to extensively collect the masses' opinions on the 1954 production plan and the problems that the masses urgently demanded to be solved, put forward proposals, and brew the candidates for the township people's government committee. On the first day of the opening of the People's Congress, the work report of the previous township people's government was heard and reviewed, and the list of candidates for township head, deputy township head, members, and chairman and vice-chairman of the people's congress was brewed. On the second day, the production targets and current production work of the whole township in 1954 were discussed, and resolutions and proposals were adopted to deal with the reports. After hearing the work report of the previous township people's government, the representatives affirmed the achievements and put forward many criticisms and suggestions to the work of the township people's government. For example, representative Ji Jixian said: "The leadership of the township people's government over mutual aid and cooperation last year was very insufficient. Problems occurred in the thirty-three mutual aid teams in Chaoyang Village, and no one solved them. Most of them collapsed." Ji Lianyu criticized that there was often no one in the township people's government, and the masses could not find cadres when they had something to do. Other representatives also pointed out that the system of the township people's government was not sound, and the division of labor was not clear, so that cadres could not give full play to their roles. The previous township head accepted everyone's criticism and made a self-criticism. Finally, one township head, three deputy township heads, and nine members of the township people's government committee were elected. One chairman and two vice-chairmen of the People's Congress, and six members of the township people's armed forces committee were elected. The congress also dealt with and answered more than 150 proposals received separately. Resolutions were made for those that could be handled at that time, and the superiors were requested to handle those that could not be handled at that time. Finally, the 1954 township production increase targets, the promotion of national construction bonds, and resolutions on substitute farming, sanitation work, and other items were passed.

  After the township people's congress closed, the representatives conveyed the election results and the resolutions of the congress to the masses, which were warmly supported by the masses of the whole township. Farmer Lao Meng said: "The resolutions made by the people's congress are really good. I am determined to do a good job in the mutual aid team, increase fertilizer, and ensure the realization of the production increase plan." Shi Mingzhen Agricultural Production Cooperative took the lead in launching a production competition. They originally planned to accumulate 1,100 loads of fertilizer before the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, but because everyone actively implemented the resolutions, they had accumulated 1,950 loads by the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. On the seventeenth day of the first lunar month, twenty-two people reclaimed more than three acres of wasteland in one day. Shi Qinghua Mutual Aid Group formulated a short-term production plan and launched a competition with six mutual aid groups in this village. This formed a climax of actively preparing for spring plowing production throughout the township. In Han Village alone, after the Spring Festival, 90% of the village's manure had been turned over, 38 large carts of fertilizer had been accumulated, 65 large carts of manure had been sent, and more than 10,000 jin of firewood had been chopped.

    山西省太谷县朝阳乡基层选举的作法
    太谷县朝阳乡普选工作组组长　张书璧
    山西省太谷县朝阳乡经过了基层选举工作，不仅从政治上、组织上更加巩固与扩大了前一阶段总路线宣传教育的成果，并根本改变了该乡原来的落后面貌，有力地推动了全乡互助合作运动和春耕准备工作的开展。
  从生产入手，结合算政治账，深入发动群众
    由于这个乡的党、政领导过去长时期对生产抓得不紧，全乡的互助合作运动很不发展，形成了“春组、夏散、秋垮台”。经过前一阶段总路线的宣传教育，群众认识并相信了只有经过互助合作的道路才能使大家都富裕起来，因而纷纷自找对象，酝酿整顿和新建互助组、农业生产合作社。工作组针对群众这个要求，从领导生产和整顿互助合作组织入手，开展普选工作。首先召集了全乡党员、团员、干部和积极分子的扩大会议，找出各互助组去年垮台的主要原因是：没有一定的计划和制度，活计安排得不好，一到忙时大家都争先恐后干自己的活，等等。接着又在互助组组长会议上研究了这些情况，订出解决办法。如割麦、锄谷要分类站队，实行评工、评产，遇有灾害，共同负责损失等。这样就提高了群众互助生产的信心，许多群众都自动酝酿成立互助组。四、五天内，全乡即整顿、发展了六十三个互助组，四个变工组，一个农业生产合作社。许多互助组并订出了全年生产计划。群众都纷纷翻粪、积肥、打柴、积燃料，积极准备春耕生产。
    在群众积极组织互助组、制订今年增产计划的时候，工作组提出了“怎样才能搞好互助合作，实现增产计划”的问题，启发群众讨论。经过讨论，群众一致认为“要是没有好干部领导，生产计划订得再好也会落空”，这样就把普选和生产在群众思想上、行动上很自然地结合起来了。与此同时，工作组又利用群众大会、小型座谈和上门宣传等方式，引导群众回忆对比在新旧社会两种不同的政权下，人民不同的政治地位和不同的经济生活。在对比中，采用就地取材的方法，抓住群众中影响最深的活人活事教育群众，效果很大。全乡人民回忆起抗日战争前地主李训当村长的罪恶事实，个个激愤。农民王连栋说：“从前的世道，穷人就没有活路。李训当村长时，整天拿着芭蕉扇在街上摆八字步，抖威风。他看见谁不顺眼，就拉到村公所‘重处’。女人们不能在街上站，不穿长袍大衫的人不能进庙。”杨二子说：“抗战前，有一回副村长武猴子家丢了麦子，李训便凭空诬赖我偷了，把俺母子三人拉到庙上打了个七死八活，还说要活埋哩！可怜我弟弟喜子回到家没三天便死去了。”籍来义说：“‘二战区’（指阎锡山匪帮统治时）时候的村长王吉祥，把村里治得东头不能到西头，有一回我从东头到西头没带路条，王吉祥就说我是‘伪装’，立刻抓到村公所打了我四十大板。”全乡群众由此更深刻地认识到旧社会的政权就是压迫人民的工具，同时也深深地感到今天的政权真是人民幸福生活的保障。人人都看得清楚，解放后政府扶植生产，仅朝阳一村就新打了水井十三眼，修了旧井三十眼，买了水车二十七辆，把七百多亩旱地变成了水田，修渠浇地八百三十多亩，因而土地产量逐年增加。经过对比，农民们认识了执掌政权的重要。王小二说：“一家有个好当家人，光景才能过好；一组有个好组长，互助组才能巩固；一乡有个好乡长，才能给咱办好事，全乡人才能过好日子。全国有咱毛主席，咱们才有今天这个好日子。”于是群众一致表示要把普选搞好，掌握住“刀把子”。
  组织群众性的人口登记和选民资格审查
    群众充分发动起来以后，即成立了乡选举委员会。根据全乡人口和居住情况，划分了十一个选区。每个选区确定了人口调查和选民资格审查人员各三人，分头进行工作。工作组一面对这些人员进行训练，交代政策和具体做法；一面向群众宣传人口调查与选民资格审查的目的和意义。开头，因为有些群众以前隐瞒了年龄，现在怕实报了受罚，个别年青姑娘们想早结婚，等等，年龄登记不实。工作组就针对这些思想顾虑进行了说服解释，并在选区会议上发动群众自动纠正年龄。农民刘培茂说：“过去我为了不给敌人看铁路，就多报了一岁，现在铁路成了人民自己的啦，我还怕啥，我一定要实报自己的年龄。”玉黄老婆说：“过去我五十岁报成五十五岁，就给‘二战区’少做了五双鞋，这回我要把年龄改过来。”工作组及时抓住这些事例进行表扬，这样全乡就有三百二十多人纠正了过去隐瞒的年龄。为了把人口登记工作做好，事先曾通知各户进行登记的时间和地点，组织群众按时到站登记，做到了“人不等站，站不等人”。
    在进行人口调查的同时，又审查了选民资格，进行了选民登记，填发了选民证。审查的结果，一面出榜公布，一面向选民宣布，对不发给选民证的人，也说明了理由。为了做到不让一个公民被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，不让一个反动分子或未经改变成份的地主阶级分子非法窃取了庄严的选举权利，工作组发动了群众性的选民资格审查。开始时群众有麻痹思想，如说：“审查小组审查的就挺合适！”“过了的事算了吧，不用惹人了！”工作组发动群众讨论了为什么要审查选民资格，让坏分子混进人民内部有什么坏处等问题。经过酝酿讨论，群众揭发出许多问题。如五选区揭发出李四娃以前和地主李二娃勾结，欺压群众，强奸妇女，图财害命等罪恶；六选区揭发了“二战区”的民卫军中队长阎麦全逼走二十多名青年的事实；七选区揭发出伪兵农大队长籍三娃的反革命事实等。群众要求剥夺他们的选举权，并把他们管制起来。同时对一些罪恶较轻又有改悔表现的人作了检查，大家同意给他们选举权。群众对地主中应改变成份和不应改变成份的也都提出具体意见。在审查中，也纠正了部分群众主张把一些平常在作风上有毛病的人，也不给选举权的“左”倾情绪。选举委员会根据群众意见，经过认真仔细地研究和审查后，作出决定，报请县人民政府批准，然后以自然村为单位分别召开了选民资格审查总结大会，宣布了处理结果。对应剥夺政治权利的分子宣布了他们的名单和罪恶事实，其中应管制的并同时发下管制通知书。又对应改变成份的地主分子和应取消管制的人，宣布解除管制，当场发给选民证。会后，又对被剥夺了选举权利的人指出前途，教育他们劳动守法，重新作人。这样做了以后，全乡人心大快，进一步提高了群众热爱人民民主政权的觉悟，划清了敌我界限，加强了人民内部的团结，给酝酿代表候选人提名打下了基础。
  充分发扬民主，认真挑选满意的代表
    在选民资格审查胜利结束的基础上，选举委员会研究了各选区代表名额及如何领导酝酿代表候选人等问题后，即首先组织选民讨论：应选什么样的人当代表。选民们提出的条件是：为人正派，大公无私，能联系群众，积极工作，坚决领导群众走社会主义道路的人。并提出“粗罗筛，细罗过，挑选咱们最满意的代表”的口号。农民孔二货说：“看清，瞅准，才能选出好代表。”在这个基础上，就由选民单独或联名提出自己拥护的人。选举委员会并发动选民对被提名的人进行讨论评比。初评比时，有些群众只提被提名的人的优点，不提缺点；也有的只从有文化，能说会道，或是孩子少，没连累（主要指妇女）等方面看，忽略了思想觉悟等方面。选举委员会针对这一情况，诱导大家要全面分析，对比被提名的人的优点和缺点，这样选民就对某些被提名的人提出了批评。如给党支部书记史明珍提出有些自私自利、架子大、联系群众不够等缺点后，史明珍就作了检讨，表示决心改正。群众说：干部有缺点不怕，只要能改正就行。提到党员干部籍振明时，群众说他立场不稳，包庇过反革命分子，坚决不能选他。同时，大家对青年团支部书记李秋贵，信用合作社主任孟昭梁等好干部也做了表扬。经过群众充分酝酿之后，选举委员会邀集共产党、青年团及地方武装、妇女等地方组织和人民团体的代表共同协商，根据群众的意见，正式提出代表候选人名单，并向选民公布，同时确定了选举日期和地址，准备选举。
    为了开好选举大会，各选民小组预先了解本组选民在家或外出情况，并具体帮助选民解决开会时看门、看小孩等困难。在春节那天，举行了选举大会，全乡十一个选区，参加选举的选民占到选民总数的百分之九十六点一九。共选出三十五名代表，有男二十八人，女七人；其中有党员十二人，团员二人。群众对自己选出的代表都十分满意。农民解长寿高兴地说：“咱们选了好代表，领导咱们走社会主义的道路，使咱们都过幸福富裕的生活。”
  召开乡人民代表大会，通过决议推动生产
    代表选出后，接着召开了第一次乡人民代表大会。乡人民代表大会召开前，选举委员会研究了大会的内容、时间和地点，并通知各代表，深入各户，广泛搜集群众对一九五四年生产计划的意见及群众当前迫切要求解决的问题，提出提案，并酝酿乡人民政府委员会的人选。人民代表大会开幕的第一天，听取并审查了上届乡人民政府的工作报告，酝酿提出乡长、副乡长、委员和人民代表大会主席、副主席的候选人名单。第二天讨论了全乡一九五四年生产指标及当前生产工作，通过决议和提案处理报告。代表们听了上届乡人民政府工作报告后，肯定了成绩，并对乡人民政府工作提出了不少批评和建议。如代表籍继先说：“去年乡人民政府对互助合作的领导很不够，朝阳村三十三个互助组发生了问题没人解决，大部分都垮台了。”籍连雨批评乡人民政府里经常没人，群众有事找不到干部。其他代表也提出乡人民政府的制度不健全，分工不明确，使干部不能充分发挥作用等。上届乡长接受了大家的批评，作了检讨。最后，选出乡长一人，副乡长三人，乡人民政府委员九人组成乡人民政府委员会。并选出人民代表大会主席一人，副主席二人，乡人民武装委员会委员六人。大会对收到的一百五十多件提案也分别作了处理和解答，当时可以办的作了决议，当时不能办的请示上级处理。最后通过了一九五四年全乡增产指标、推销国家建设公债以及代耕、卫生工作等项决议。
    乡人民代表大会闭幕后，代表们向群众传达了选举结果和大会决议，获得了全乡群众的热烈拥护。农民老孟说：“代表大会作的决议真好，我决心要搞好互助组，增加肥料，保证增产计划实现。”史明珍农业生产合作社带头展开生产竞赛，他们原计划正月十五前积肥一千一百担，但由于大家积极贯彻决议，到正月十五日已积了一千九百五十担，正月十七日一天，二十二个人就开了三亩多荒地。史清化互助组订出了短期生产计划，和本村六个互助组展开了竞赛。这样就在全乡形成了积极准备春耕生产的高潮。仅韩村一个自然村，春节以后，全村粪土已翻过百分之九十，积肥三十八大车，送粪六十五大车，打柴一万余斤。
