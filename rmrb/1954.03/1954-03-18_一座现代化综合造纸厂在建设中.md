A modern integrated paper mill producing industrial paper is under construction in Jiamusi City.

This paper mill is one of the 141 projects the Soviet government is helping China build. It will not only produce industrial paper but also manufacture copper mesh for papermaking. Once completed, this factory will be China's newest paper mill and one of the largest in Asia. The scale of this project is enormous, with five tall factory buildings for copper mesh, pulping, papermaking, repair, and power generation to be built on more than 100,000 square meters of land. The pulping plant alone has nine workshops for wood preparation, cooking, washing, etc. All pulping processes, from wood transportation, splitting, and chipping to all papermaking processes, such as mixing raw materials, pressing, and drying, are mechanized and automated. The scale of equipment installation is also very large. The copper mesh factory alone has 335 equipment installation projects, and the Soviet Union is helping China manufacture 100 new types of machinery and electrical equipment.

The integrated paper mill has the most advanced technical equipment. It has Soviet-made paper machines, which are the newest in the world and have extremely high mechanical efficiency. Each machine can produce 400 meters of paper, more than two meters wide, per minute, which is three to five times higher than the production capacity of existing paper machines in China. In addition to wood, papermaking raw materials can also use red pine bark, which not only expands the variety of papermaking raw materials but also saves a large amount of wood and investment in basic construction. This is a technological revolution in China's papermaking industry, marking a further improvement in China's papermaking technology level with the help of Soviet science and technology.

After the completion of this integrated paper mill, the wood continuously transported from the Lesser Khingan Mountains will be made into high-quality cement bags, cable paper required for fire prevention, corrosion prevention, acid prevention, and protection of underground cables and high-altitude high-voltage lines, as well as very durable and clean medicinal packaging paper and wrapping paper.

While building this modern paper mill, an elegant and unique workers' village will also be built. Here, dormitories, clubs, hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens, children's schools... will be built. In the central square of the workers' village, there will be a beautiful garden, and the entire village will be planted with trees and greenery, and the streets will be paved with asphalt roads. This project began construction last year with more than 18,000 square meters, and some employees have moved into new-style buildings.

This huge project attracts people's hard work. To ensure timely commencement of work, trains loaded with new mechanical equipment arrive continuously from home and abroad. Cars and horse-drawn carriages transport materials day and night. Male and female comrades from the materials department often go to the central island of the Songhua River before sunrise to inspect the quality of the river stones and return in the evening. At noon, they set up tents on the island with tarpaulins and make fires to cook. Surveyors brave the severe cold of minus 30 degrees to actively carry out leveling measurements of the factory site. The employees are working hard to prepare for construction.

    一座现代化综合造纸厂在建设中
    潘国华
    在佳木斯市正在建设着一座现代化的生产工业用纸的综合造纸厂。
    这座纸厂是苏联政府帮助我国建设的一百四十一项工程之一，它不仅要造工业用纸，而且还要制作造纸所用的铜网。这个厂建成后，将成为我国最新式的造纸厂，是亚洲最大的造纸厂之一。这个工程的规模是庞大的，要在十万多平方公尺的土地上建筑铜网、制浆、造纸、修配、发电等五座高大厂房。仅制浆厂就有调木、蒸煮、洗涤等九个车间。从木材运送、劈开、剥片等全部制浆过程到调合原料、压榨、干燥等全部抄纸过程，都是机械化和自动化。工厂的设备安装工程规模也是很大的。仅铜网厂就有三百三十五项设备安装工程，仅苏联帮助我国制造的新式机械、电气设备就有一百项。
    综合纸厂的技术设备是最先进的。有苏联制造的抄纸机，是世界上最新式的，机械效率极高，每台每分钟能生产出二公尺多宽的纸四百公尺，比我国原有造纸厂的抄纸机的生产能力要高三倍到五倍。造纸原料除使用木料外，并能使用红松皮，不仅扩大了造纸原料种类，而且可节省大量木料，投入基本建设。这是我国造纸工业的技术上的革命，标志着在苏联科学技术的帮助下我国造纸技术水平进一步的提高。
    这个综合纸厂建成后，由小兴安岭源源不断运来的木材，将在这里制成品质优良的水泥袋，防火、防腐、防酸、保护地下的电缆和高空中高压线所需的电缆用纸，以及非常耐用和清洁的药包纸和包装纸。
    在建设这座现代化的纸厂同时，还要建筑一处幽雅别致的工人村。在这里，将要盖起宿舍、俱乐部、医院、托儿所、幼稚园、子弟学校……。在工人村的中心广场有美丽的花园，村子周围全部植树绿化，来往街道将变成柏油马路。这项工程已于去年开始建筑了一万八千多平方公尺，部分职工已搬进了新式楼房。
    这座巨大的工程，吸引着人们的辛勤劳动。为了保证按期开工，在这里，火车装载着新型机械设备，不断地从国内外到来。汽车、马车起早贪黑赶运材料。材料科男女同志经常从日头不出来就到松花江中心岛，检查河流石质量，到了晚间才回来。中午，就在江心岛用苫布搭起帐篷，升火烧饭。测量人员冒着零下三十度的严寒，积极进行厂址的抄平测量。职工们一心为作好施工准备而辛勤地劳动着。
