Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 14th: One hundred and twenty-one state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region overfulfilled the state production value plan for February. The total production value completed by various factories and mines in February exceeded the state plan by 8.1 percent. From January to February, the cumulative total production value completed 69.9 percent of the first quarter plan. Among the forty-eight major products in the region, the output of forty kinds, including steel ingots, raw coal, electricity generation, electric motors, cement, yarn, and cloth, exceeded the state plan in February.

The position of a number of important factories and mines in the Northeast that have been newly built and expanded and successively put into production has become increasingly significant in production. For example, the capacity of new power generating equipment installed by the electric power sector in recent years accounts for 31 percent of the total power generating capacity of the region. These factories and mines, equipped with new technology and equipment, mostly overfulfilled the state plan in February. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel tube plant, which went into production last year, exceeded the state plan by 4.9 to 48 percent in the production of heavy steel rails, channel steel, and seamless steel tubes in February. The quality of these steel products also exceeded the state plan by 7.13 to 15.1 percent. The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Mine, which was handed over to production last "July 1st," also overproduced more than 5,000 tons of coal in February. The Harbin Electric Motor Factory and the Flax Mill, which were put into production earlier, both overfulfilled the plan in February. The total production value of the Harbin Electric Motor Factory in February exceeded more than double that of the same period last year. The Harbin Flax Mill produced high-quality linen in February, an increase of nearly half compared to the same period last year.

Thanks to improved technical operations in industrial sectors such as steel, electricity, non-ferrous metals, and textiles throughout the region, many products have broken through technical quotas and quality indicators. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient in February averaged 5.9 tons of steel per square meter, exceeding the state plan by about 10 percent; the daily output was much higher than the average daily output in the fourth quarter of last year. The electricity consumption per kilowatt-hour in the electric power industry has been reduced to 0.63 kilograms of coal, breaking through the state plan indicator. The amount of electricity lost in transmission lines was reduced by 4.74 percent compared to the state plan, of which two extra-high voltage transmission lines alone lost 2 million kilowatt-hours less in February. Many products have also broken through quality indicators. Among the twenty-nine kinds of products with quality plans in the steel, non-ferrous metals, and textile industries, twenty-one kinds, including steel ingots, electrolytic copper, and cotton cloth, broke through the quality indicators in February. The pass rate of steel ingots at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company reached 98.28 percent, setting a new record since the start of the factory. The first-class cloth rate of cotton cloth also reached 97.02 percent.

The victories achieved by state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region in February are unprecedented. In previous years, coal mines in the Northeast always failed to complete the state plan in February, but this year, they overproduced more than 94,000 tons of raw coal. The total production value of forty-two state-owned machinery manufacturing factories exceeded the plan by more than 10 percent. The Shenyang Air Compressor Factory, the Harbin Tool Factory, and others have exceeded by a large margin. The Harbin Tool Factory, which originally only completed 87.58 percent of the production value plan in January, overfulfilled the state production value plan by 6.72 percent in February because the workers reversed their lax thinking, and produced the precision tools such as broaches, hobbing cutters, sample rings, and sample pillars urgently needed for the trial production of new products by the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory and the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 14th: One hundred and sixty-two local state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region completed and overfulfilled the February production plan. The total production value completed 103 percent; calculated on a daily average, the total production value in February increased by 9.1 percent compared to January.

Among the twenty-five major products in February, sixteen exceeded the plan. The manganese ore produced by the Liaoxi Wafangdian Manganese Mine exceeded by 5.4 percent in February, and these manganese ores are indispensable raw materials for iron smelting at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The steam boilers overfulfilled by the Anshan Rivet Factory, the oil felt paper overfulfilled by the Fushun and Benxi oil felt paper factories, etc., are all urgently needed materials for national industrial construction and industrial production. The shovel plows produced by the Jiamusi Farm Tool Factory, etc., have also overproduced a lot, which is a strong support for the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Liaodong tussah silk and tussah silk, a special product of Northeast China, as well as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, soybean oil, sugar, and cultural supplies such as fountain pens, which are needed for the daily life of the broad masses of people, have also overfulfilled the production plan, and the quality is not bad either.

    东北国营厂矿完成上月产值计划
    新建和扩建的重要厂矿起了显著的作用
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北区有一百二十一个国营厂矿超额完成了二月份国家产值计划。各厂矿二月份完成的生产总值共计超过国家计划百分之八点一。一、二月份，生产总值累计已完成第一季度计划百分之六十九点九。全区四十八种主要产品中，二月份有钢锭、原煤、发电量、电动机、水泥、纱、布等四十种的产量超过了国家计划。
    东北各地新建和扩建后陆续投入生产的一批重要厂矿，在生产中所占的地位已日益显著。例如电力部门几年来安装的新的发电设备能力，已占到全区总发电设备能力百分之三十一。这些用新的技术设备武装起来的工厂矿山，二月份大都超额完成了国家计划。去年投入生产的鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，二月份生产的重型钢轨、槽钢和无缝钢管都超额百分之四点九到百分之四十八完成了国家计划。这些钢铁产品的质量也都超过国家计划百分之七点一三到百分之十五点一。去年“七一”移交生产的阜新海州露天矿，二月份也超额生产五千多吨煤。投入生产较早的哈尔滨电机厂和亚麻厂，二月份都超额完成计划。哈尔滨电机厂二月份生产总值比去年同期超过一倍以上。哈尔滨亚麻厂二月份生产质量优良的亚麻布，比去年同期增加了近一半。
    全区钢铁、电力、有色金属和纺织等工业部门由于改进技术操作，许多产品都突破了技术定额和质量指标。鞍山钢铁公司二月份平炉利用系数是平均每平方公尺炼钢五点九吨，超过国家计划百分之十左右；日产量比去年第四季度平均日产量超过很多。电力工业部门每度电耗煤已降低到零点六三公斤，突破了国家计划指标。送电线路损失的电量比国家计划降低了百分之四点七四，其中有两条超高压送电线路二月份就少损失电量二百万度。许多产品并突破了质量指标。在钢铁、有色金属和纺织三个工业部门二十九种有质量计划的产品中，二月份就有钢锭、电铜、棉布等二十一种突破了质量指标。鞍山钢铁公司的钢锭合格率达到百分之九十八点二八，创开厂以来的新纪录。棉布正布率也达到百分之九十七点零二。
    东北区国营厂矿二月份取得这些胜利是前所未有的。东北各煤矿往年二月份总是完不成国家计划，可是今年二月份却超额生产了原煤九万四千多吨。四十二个国营机械制造工厂的生产总值超过计划百分之十以上。沈阳空气压缩机厂、哈尔滨工具厂等都超过很多。原来一月份只完成产值计划百分之八十七点五八的哈尔滨工具厂，因为职工们扭转了松劲思想，二月份就超额六点七二完成了国家产值计划，提前制造出沈阳第二机床厂和济南第一机床厂试制新产品所急需的拉刀、滚刀、样圈和样柱等精密工具。
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北区有一百六十二个地方国营厂矿完成和超额完成了二月份生产计划。生产总值完成了百分之一百零三；按每日平均计算，二月份生产总值比一月份提高了百分之九点一。
    二月份二十五种主要产品中，有十六种超额完成了计划。辽西瓦房子锰矿生产的锰矿石，二月份超额百分之五点四，这些锰矿石是鞍山钢铁公司炼铁不可缺少的原料。鞍山铆造厂超额完成的蒸汽锅炉，抚顺、本溪等地油毡纸厂超额完成的油毡纸等，都是国家进行工业建设和工业生产所迫切需要的物资。佳木斯农具厂等生产的铲趟机也超额生产了很多，这对农业互助合作运动是一个有力的支援。东北特产辽东的柞蚕丝、柞蚕绸以及广大人民日常生活所需要的棉纱、棉布、豆油、糖和文化用品金笔等，也都超额完成了生产计划，质量也不坏。
