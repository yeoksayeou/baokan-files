    The Great Successor to Lenin's Cause
    Soviet Union A. Krasov

    Today, the Party, the Soviet people, and all progressive mankind commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause and the wise leader of the working people. Stalin's name is infinitely revered by the Soviet people and the working people of the world. The cause of Lenin and Stalin is immortal. This cause lives forever in the heroic undertaking of the Communist Party and all the Soviet people—the builders of communism—and it lives forever in the victory of the democratic and socialist camp and the international revolutionary movement.

    The life of J.V. Stalin was dedicated to the noble cause of serving the working people. He selflessly fought for the freedom and happiness of the working people and for the victory of communism. He traversed the arduous but glorious path of a proletarian revolutionary—a professional revolutionary. Countless hardships, Tsarist prisons, and exiles could not destroy his iron will, his tenacious courage in the struggle against the old world, and his indomitable spirit. In the fierce struggle against the Tsarist system and the capitalist system, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism inspired him, pointing the way for the working class to break free from exploitation, seize power, and establish a new society.

    Stalin always understood his constant, inseparable connection with the masses, and he dedicated his formidable strength to them. He deeply believed in the people, in the boundless revolutionary power and creative initiative of the workers and peasants, and his entire activity relied on the masses, recognizing them as the true creators of history.

    J.V. Stalin was Lenin's faithful and valuable student. In every aspect, he was always a steadfast Leninist, the successor and defender of Lenin's thought. He regarded Lenin as the brilliant creator and leader of the Soviet Communist Party, the highest example of leadership, and a fearless eagle. Together with Lenin, Stalin fought for a new type of party, steadfastly and resolutely defending Lenin's ideas, organization, tactics, and theoretical foundations of the Marxist party, and tempering the party in the struggle against all enemies of Leninism.

    Stalin's genius as an outstanding organizer and the power of his theories were particularly evident during the revolutionary period and the period of building a socialist society in the Soviet Union. In 1917, Stalin, together with Lenin and under his leadership, carried out the enormous work of winning over the masses and preparing for the socialist revolution.

    The Communist Party, under the leadership of the genius of mankind, Lenin, organized a fighting alliance of the working class and the poorest peasants, leading to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. For the first time in history, a new type of state was established—a socialist state of workers and peasants.

    Stalin, along with Ya.M. Sverdlov and other students of Lenin, were Lenin's closest assistants in the cause of building the Soviet state. As People's Commissar for Nationalities Affairs, Stalin directly led the work of implementing the Communist Party's nationalities policy, uniting all the people of the country under the Soviet banner in a unified, fraternal family.

    During the years of the Civil War and foreign armed intervention, Lenin led the entire effort to defend the Soviet state. Stalin was his closest assistant. The Party dispatched Stalin to the most critical and decisive theaters of war. The defense of Tsaritsyn, the crushing of Kolchak, Yudenich, Denikin, the Polish aristocracy, and Wrangel—all these military operations are associated with Stalin's name. In every circumstance, he flexibly and bravely carried out the tasks of the Party and the instructions of the great Lenin.

    When the transition to a period of peaceful construction occurred, Stalin worked as an unyielding Leninist in the leadership of the Party and the state, in the struggle to restore the national economy, and in the cause of establishing and consolidating the Soviet multinational state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    After the death of Lenin, the great founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, Stalin, in the name of the Party and the people, swore to remain faithful to his legacy—to maintain the unity of the Party, to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, the worker-peasant alliance, and the friendship of all nationalities, and to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism. Stalin remained faithful to these legacies throughout his life. In every respect, he succeeded Lenin, calling on the Soviet people to live, work, fight, and triumph over enemies at home and abroad as Lenin had done. Under the leadership of the Central Committee, headed by Stalin, the Communist Party crushed traitors and capitulators, defended Leninism, and guided the country onto the path of socialist construction.

    Stalin defended and tempered the unity of Lenin's Party and the solidarity of the Party ranks in the fierce struggle against all kinds of enemies. The unity of the Party ranks, the Party's solidarity around its Central Committee, was, is, and will always be the decisive condition for the Party's strength and invincibility. The Communist Party has been able to successfully realize its great historical mission and tasks precisely because it is a united group of comrades with a unified will, unified action, and unified discipline.

    The Leninist leadership core, headed by Stalin, was formed in the struggle for socialist construction. Stalin won the universal respect and boundless faith of the people and the Party. His loyal comrades rallied around him in friendship, and for thirty years, Stalin steadfastly guided the Party and the state along the path indicated by Lenin.

    Stalin creatively developed the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, adapting it to new historical conditions, and enriching revolutionary theory with new arguments on many issues.

    Lenin's brilliant and immortal works scientifically demonstrated the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country, pointing out the direction for the Soviet people to advance towards communism. These programmatic principles of Lenin were further developed in Stalin's writings and in the resolutions of the Party. Based on these principles, the Party formulated a concrete program for the socialist industrialization of the country. The implementation of the industrialization plan ensured the Soviet Union's economic independence, strengthened its national defense, and established the material foundation for socialist and communist construction.

    Stalin further developed and concretized Lenin's cooperative plan—a great plan to attract the masses of peasants to participate in the cause of socialist construction. On the basis of Lenin's instructions, and under Stalin's leadership, the Party formulated and implemented a plan for the collectivization of agriculture.

    Due to the implementation of the Party's policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, the Soviet Union completed a great leap from a backward agricultural country to a powerful socialist country of industry and collective farms.

    The Great Patriotic War was the most severe test of the power and vitality of the Soviet social and state system. The Soviet Union gloriously endured this severe test. In moments of extreme crisis, the people of the entire country responded to the call of the Party and Stalin, rising up to defend their freedom and independence. The historic victory in the war, achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party, demonstrated the power and invincibility of the Soviet social and state system, and demonstrated the victory of the Party's policy.

    The Communist Party and its Central Committee have transformed the socialist state into an indestructible fortress of peace and democracy for the entire world. The Party's activities are directed towards further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, consolidating the friendship of all nationalities, and promoting socialist democracy. Lenin and Stalin regarded the close alliance between workers and peasants as the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance is a guarantee of further victories for the Soviet people in the construction of communism.

    In carrying out Lenin's legacy, Stalin tirelessly devoted himself to establishing a firm friendship among the people of all fraternal Soviet nationalities.

    Stalin enriched Leninism on the national question by summarizing the experiences of the multinational socialist state.

    The friendship among all nationalities is a great achievement of the Party and a result of the implementation of Lenin's and Stalin's nationalities policy. The Communist Party considers it its sacred duty to fully consolidate the unity and friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union—the foundation of the foundation of the Soviet multinational state.

    Stalin creatively developed Lenin's doctrine on the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country, arguing that the Soviet Union could build communism even if capitalist encirclement still existed. He thus proved that if capitalist encirclement continued to exist, the necessity of preserving the state under the communist system. Based on Lenin's instructions for building communism in the Soviet Union, Stalin stipulated the basic conditions for preparing the transition from socialism to communism.

    At the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin delivered a historic speech. This was the last speech he made before the Party and the country. In his speech, Stalin emphasized the consistency of the interests of the Soviet working people with the interests of the working people of all countries, proving that the interests of the Soviet Union were inseparable from the cause of peace throughout the world.

    Until the last moments of his life, Stalin remained at his combat post, leading the Party and the country, and uniting peace-loving people around the world in the struggle against the instigators of war and in the maintenance and defense of peace.

    After the death of their leader, the Soviet people have rallied even more closely under the Leninist banner, around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. Over the past year, the Party and the working people of the Soviet state have demonstrated with renewed strength their loyalty to the cause of Lenin and Stalin, and their determination to achieve new successes in the construction of communism. The Party and the government have ensured the normal and uninterrupted leadership of all aspects of the state, successfully implementing the long-term domestic and international policies that have been formulated.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet government tirelessly inspire the creative initiative of the working people to engage in the successful construction of communism. The Soviet people are resolutely implementing the historic resolutions of the September Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as recent resolutions of the Party and the government, which outline concrete programs for the rapid development of light industry, the food industry, and all sectors of agriculture (primarily livestock, potato, and grain production). The Party and the government are paying great attention to the work of cultivating new land, which is the most important reserve for increasing grain production.

    The decisions of the Party and the government are permeated with a great concern for the happiness of the people and for the maximum satisfaction of the people's ever-growing material and cultural needs.

    The workers of the collective farms, in order to realize the national tasks put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government in the face of agriculture, enthusiastically participated in socialist competition.

    At present, a new high tide of labor and politics is surging in the Soviet Union, inspired by the preparations for the elections to the Supreme Soviet and the appeal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to all voters. In the election campaign, the masses of Party members and non-Party members have formed an alliance. This alliance demonstrates the unbreakable unity between the Party, the government, and the people, and demonstrates the spiritual and political consistency of Soviet society.

    Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, and under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are advancing confidently towards a bright communist future.

    列宁事业的伟大继承者
    苏联  阿·克拉索夫
    今天，党、苏联人民和全体进步人类纪念列宁事业的伟大继承者，劳动人民的英明领袖约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林的逝世一周年。斯大林的名字对苏联人民和全世界劳动者来说是无限尊贵的。列宁和斯大林的事业是不朽的。这个事业永存在共产党和全体苏联人民——共产主义建设者的英雄事业中，永存在民主和社会主义阵营的胜利和国际革命运动中。
    约·维·斯大林的一生都贡献给为劳动人民服务的崇高事业，他忘我地为劳动人民的自由和幸福而斗争，为共产主义的胜利而斗争。他经历了一个无产阶级革命家——职业革命家——的艰巨然而光荣的道路。无数的艰难困苦、沙皇的监狱和流放都不能摧毁他那钢铁的意志、与旧世界斗争的坚韧勇敢和顽强性。在与沙皇制度和资本主义制度的残酷斗争中，马克思列宁主义的伟大思想鼓舞了他，马克思列宁主义给工人阶级指出了摆脱剥削，夺取政权，建立新社会的道路。
    斯大林始终意识到自己和人民群众的不间断的血肉联系，他为人民群众献出了自己雄伟的力量。他深切地相信人民，相信工人和农民的无穷无尽的革命力量和创造的主动性，他的全部活动都依靠着群众，认为群众是历史的真正创造者。
    约·维·斯大林是列宁的忠实的和可贵的学生。在任何方面，他始终是坚定不移的列宁主义者，列宁思想的继承者和保卫者，他把列宁看作苏联共产党的天才创造者和领袖，最高典型的领导者，无畏的山鹰。和列宁在一起，斯大林曾为新型的党斗争过，顽强而坚决地捍卫了列宁关于马克思主义政党的思想、组织、策略和理论的基础，在和一切列宁主义的敌人的斗争中锻炼了党。
    斯大林杰出的组织者的天才和理论的威力在革命时期和苏联建设社会主义社会时期表现得特别突出。在一九一七年，斯大林和列宁一起并在他的领导下进行了争取群众，准备社会主义革命的巨大工作。
    在人类的天才列宁的领导下的共产党组织了工人阶级和最贫苦的农民的战斗联盟后，得到了伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。在历史上第一次建立了新型的国家——工人和农民的社会主义国家。
    斯大林和雅·米·斯维尔德洛夫及列宁的其他学生是列宁在建设苏维埃国家的事业中的最亲密的助手。斯大林作为民族事宜人民委员直接领导了实现共产党民族政策的工作，共产党在苏维埃旗帜下把全国人民团结在统一的兄弟家庭中。
    在国内战争及外国武装干涉的年月中，列宁领导了保卫苏维埃国家的全部事业。斯大林是他的最亲近的助手。党派遣斯大林到最危急和最有决定性的战区去。保卫察里津，粉碎高尔察克、尤登尼奇、邓尼金、波兰贵族和弗兰格尔，所有这些战斗行动都是和斯大林的名字相联系的。在任何场合中，他都灵活地和勇敢地执行党的任务和伟大的列宁的指示。
    当过渡到和平建设时期，在党和国家的领导工作中，在争取国民经济恢复的斗争中，在建立和巩固苏维埃多民族国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的事业中，斯大林是以不屈不挠的列宁主义者来进行工作的。
    共产党和苏维埃国家的伟大创始人列宁逝世后，斯大林以党和人民的名义宣誓要忠实于他的遗训——维护党的统一，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政、工农联盟以及各族人民的友谊，高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。斯大林毕生忠实于这些遗训，他在各方面都继承了列宁；号召苏联人民要照列宁那样去生活和工作，战斗和战胜国内外敌人。共产党在以斯大林为首的中央委员会领导下粉碎了叛徒和投降分子，捍卫了列宁主义并引导国家走上社会主义建设的道路。
    斯大林在和各种各样敌人进行残酷的斗争中，保卫并锻炼了列宁的党的统一性，党的队伍的团结一致。党的队伍的统一，党团结在自己的中央委员会的周围，过去是、现在和将来也是党的强大和不可战胜的决定性的条件。共产党本身伟大的历史使命和任务所以能够顺利实现，就是因为党是意志统一，行动统一，纪律统一的同志所组成的团结一致的集团。
    以斯大林为首的列宁主义者的领导核心是党在为社会主义建设的斗争中形成起来的。斯大林博得了人民和党的普遍尊敬和无限信仰，他的忠实战友们友爱地围绕着他，三十年来，斯大林坚持不渝地引导党和国家沿着列宁所指出的道路前进。
    斯大林创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义学说，使之适应于新的历史条件，并在许多问题中以新的论述丰富了革命理论。
    在列宁的天才的不朽著作中，科学地论证了社会主义在一国胜利的可能性，指出苏联人民向共产主义前进的方向。列宁的这些纲领性的原理在斯大林的著作和党的决议中得到了进一步的发展。党依据这些原理拟定了国家社会主义工业化的具体纲领，工业化计划的实现保证了苏联的经济独立，巩固了它的国防，建立了社会主义和共产主义建设的物质基础。
    斯大林进一步发展和具体化了列宁的合作社计划——吸引农民群众参加社会主义建设事业的伟大计划。党在列宁指示的基础上，在斯大林的领导下制定和实现了农业合作化的计划。
    由于党的国家工业化和农业集体化的政策的实现，苏联完成了从落后的农业国变为强大的工业和集体农庄的社会主义国家的巨大飞跃。
    伟大的卫国战争乃是对苏维埃社会和国家制度的威力和生命力的最严重的考验。苏联光荣地经受住了这场严重的考验。在极危急的时刻，全国人民响应党和斯大林的号召，奋起保卫自己的自由和独立。在共产党领导下所得到的战争的历史性胜利，显示出苏联的社会和国家制度的威力和不可战胜性，显示出党的政策的胜利。
    共产党及其中央委员会把社会主义国家变成全世界和平和民主的不可摧毁的堡垒。党的活动指向进一步巩固工农联盟，巩固各族人民的友谊和发扬社会主义的民主主义。列宁和斯大林把工人和农民的亲密联盟看做是无产阶级专政的最高原则。工农联盟的巩固乃是苏联人民在共产主义建设中进一步胜利的保证。
    斯大林在执行列宁的遗训时，不倦地致力于建立苏维埃各兄弟民族人民的牢固友谊。
    斯大林在总结多民族的社会主义国家的经验的基础上丰富了列宁主义关于民族问题的学说。
    各族人民间的友谊是党的伟大收获，是列宁、斯大林民族政策实现的成果。共产党认为自己的神圣责任就是全力巩固苏联各族人民的团结和友谊——苏维埃多民族国家基础之基础。
    斯大林创造性地发展了列宁关于社会主义可能在一国胜利的学说，论证了即使在资本主义包围仍然存在的情况下苏联可能建成共产主义的学说。从而他证明如果资本主义包围继续存在，在共产主义制度下，保存国家的必要性。依据列宁对于在苏联建设共产主义的指示，斯大林规定了准备从社会主义过渡到共产主义的基本条件。
    在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上，斯大林作了历史性的演说。这是他在党和国家面前所作的最后的演说。斯大林在其演说中强调苏联劳动人民利益和各国劳动人民利益的一致性，证明苏联利益是和全世界和平事业分不开的。
    斯大林直到生命的最后仍坚守着战斗岗位，领导党和国家，并在反对战争煽动者及维护和保卫和平的斗争中团结世界爱好和平的人们。
    苏联人民在自己的领袖逝世后，更紧密地团结在列宁主义旗帜下，团结在苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的周围。过去一年中，党和苏维埃国家的劳动人民用新的力量表明了自己对列宁、斯大林事业的忠诚，表明了自己在共产主义建设中取得新成就的决心。党和政府保证了对国家一切方面正常的不间断的领导，成功地执行着所制定的长时期内国内和国际事务方面的政策。
    共产党和苏联政府不倦地鼓舞劳动人民的创造积极性从事共产主义的顺利建设。苏联人民正在坚决地实现苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会的历史性决议以及党和政府最近的一些决议，这些决议指出迅速发展轻工业、食品工业和农业的各部门（首先是畜牧、马铃薯和谷物生产）的战斗的具体纲领。党和政府对开垦新地的工作给予很大的注意，这项工作乃是增加谷物生产的最重要的后备力量。
    党和政府的决定贯彻着对于人民的幸福，对于最大限度满足人民经常增长的物质和文化需要的伟大关怀。
    集体农庄的劳动者，为实现共产党和苏联政府在农业面前提出的全民任务，热情地参加了社会主义竞赛。
    现在，苏联国内正在掀起新的劳动的和政治的高潮，这种高潮是为最高苏维埃选举的准备工作和苏共中央委员会告全体选民书所鼓舞起来的。在选举运动中党和非党群众结成联盟。这个联盟表现着党、政府和人民间牢不可破的团结，表现着苏维埃社会在精神上和政治上的一致。
    在列宁和斯大林的旗帜下，在共产党英明领导下，苏联人民满怀信心地向着光明的共产主义前途前进。
