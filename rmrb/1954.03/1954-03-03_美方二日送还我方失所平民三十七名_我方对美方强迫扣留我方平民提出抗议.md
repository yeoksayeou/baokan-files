Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 2nd: On March 2nd, the US side sent back 37 of our civilians, who were abducted from our area in the past and had long been displaced in the US-controlled area. This number is 33 less than the figure the US side formally notified us of on February 18th, and one less than the new figure proposed by the US side on February 27th after overturning the above completely absurd figure. During the reception, our side also discovered that two of our civilians, originally listed on the list submitted by the US side on February 27th and claimed by the US side to be returned on March 2nd, were not handed over to our side on March 2nd. The above situation further exposed the US side's crime of violating Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement and forcibly detaining our civilians. In response, our receiving officer, during the handover process on March 2nd, protested to the other side on the order of the Chief Commissioner of our side of the Committee to Assist Displaced Civilians in Returning Home.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 2nd: At 10 a.m. today, 37 displaced civilians stranded in South Korea crossed the military demarcation line and returned to our area.

They were mostly elderly people, women, and children, as well as a disabled person who had lost an arm. They looked haggard, and most of their clothes were tattered US military uniforms. When these people who had suffered hardships saw the flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea flying over Panmunjom, many of them cried with emotion. An old lady who originally lived in Hamhung City held her husband's ashes and walked off the truck sobbing. Her husband was unable to survive the torment of Syngman Rhee's dark rule and died ten days before he could return home.

During the handover process, our side discovered that two people on the list submitted by the US side on February 27th had not been sent. Our side immediately protested, demanding that the US side send the above civilians back. According to the displaced civilians who returned today: the two displaced civilians originally lived with them in Munsan. At 3 p.m. on March 1st, more than 20 Syngman Rhee plainclothes police officers came and took the two people away. The remaining 37 people were also subjected to brutal searches by Syngman Rhee's police.

Zhao Nan, a displaced civilian who returned today, said that displaced civilians in South Korea who want to return home must first obtain permission from the local police station before they can register. Many of his friends and neighbors are willing to return home, but they have no way to return because they cannot get permission from the police station. Another displaced civilian, Park Chun-seop, said: Syngman Rhee's agents, police, and military police took turns going to the homes of displaced civilians to intimidate and threaten them, forbidding them from registering to return home.

Today, many Kaesong citizens stood on both sides of the highway leading to Panmunjom in the suburbs to welcome the return of displaced civilians. However, they felt sad and disappointed because many of their relatives were forcibly detained by the US side and were unable to return. The US side claims that there are 1.5 million northern civilians in South Korea. However, when the two sides exchanged the approximate number of returning civilians, the US side said that only about 70 displaced civilians were willing to return home. Later, this number was reduced to 38. Today, only 37 actually returned, which is less than one in 40,000 of the 1.5 million.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 2nd: Pyongyang residents whose relatives were abducted to South Korea by the US-Rhee army during the war are all eager for their relatives to return home for an early reunion and live a peaceful and prosperous life.

Li Yin-kuo, a 61-year-old plasterer, a resident of Longxing Erdong (formerly Wenxing Erdong), Pyongyang, had his son, Li An-mo (who used to work at the Korean Woolen Clothing Factory), forcibly abducted to South Korea by the US-Rhee bandit army in early December 1950, just before the liberation of Pyongyang. Although Li Yin-kuo's family of five lived well under the care and attention of the government, they had always been saddened by the loss of Li An-mo, who was abducted by the enemy. They were all eagerly awaiting the return of their loved ones. When they heard that the two sides had reached an agreement in Panmunjom on assisting displaced civilians in returning home, their hearts were filled with joy and hope. Later, when they heard that the US side was only prepared to allow 70 of our displaced civilians to return home, they were very distressed and disappointed. They were extremely angry at the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain civilians. Li An-mo's wife, Chi Hyong-shil, said indignantly: The US-Rhee bandits must return our relatives. This debt must be repaid.

Kim, an old lady, a neighbor of Li Yin-kuo, also had her son, Kim Bong-chul, abducted by the enemy during the war. She lives a lonely life with her daughter-in-law and two young grandchildren. Old lady Kim is heartbroken and cries day and night, hoping for her son's return, sometimes even calling out her son's name in the middle of the night. She often takes her daughter-in-law and grandchildren to the Dong office (equivalent to the village people's committee) to inquire about news of displaced civilians returning home. When they heard the news that the US side was unwilling to assist a large number of our displaced civilians in returning home, it aroused infinite grief and indignation.

Park Eung-seop, a 53-year-old old lady, a resident of Girim I-dong, Pyongyang, had her son, Zhao Tae-hwan, and daughter, Zhao In-suk, abducted by the enemy. She misses her children who are displaced abroad day and night. She said: The US-Rhee bandits have torn apart our happy family. It has been more than three years, and they still refuse to let my children return. This hatred will never be forgotten.

Kim Hak-deok, a merchant in the western district of Pyongyang, Park Nam-jin, a farmer in the eastern district of Pyongyang, Li Jeong-chun, and many other families who have suffered the same misfortune, also condemned the crimes of the US-Rhee bandits in abducting and forcibly detaining civilians, and firmly demanded that the US side abide by the agreement between the two sides and quickly assist our displaced civilians in returning to their hometowns.

    美方二日送还我方失所平民三十七名
    我方对美方强迫扣留我方平民提出抗议
    【新华社开城二日电】三月二日美方将它过去自我方地区所掳走的曾长期流离于美方地区的大量我方平民中的三十七名送回我方。这一数字较之美方二月十八日正式通知我方的数字少三十三名，较之美方二月二十七日推翻上述本已完全荒谬的数字后所提出的新的数字又少一名。在接收时，我方并发现有两名原列入美方二月二十七日交来的名单中、据美方声称定于三月二日送回我方的我方平民没有在三月二日被送交我方。上述情况更进一步暴露了美方违反停战协定第五十九款、强迫扣留我方平民的罪行。对此，我方接收军官在三月二日的交接过程中，奉协助失所平民返乡委员会我方首席委员之命，向对方提出抗议。
    【新华社开城二日电】今天上午十时，有三十七名流落在南朝鲜的失所平民越过军事分界线，回到我方地区来。
    他们大部分是老人、妇女和儿童，还有一个失去了一只手臂的残废人。他们面目憔悴，穿的衣服大半是破烂的美军军装。当这些饱经苦难的人们看到飘扬在板门店上空的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国旗的时候，好多人都激动得痛哭起来。一个原来住在咸兴市的老太太抱着她的丈夫的骨灰，泣不成声地走下卡车来。她的丈夫没有能够最后熬过李承晚黑暗统治的折磨，竟在他能够回家的前十天病死了。
    在交接过程中，我方发现在美方二月二十七日交来的名单上，有两个人没有被送来。我方当即提出抗议，要求美方将上述平民送回。据今天归来的失所平民说：那两个失所平民在汶山原与他们住在一起，三月一日下午三点钟，来了二十多个李承晚便衣警察，把这两个人押走。其余的三十七个人也都遭到李承晚警察的野蛮搜查。
    今天归来的失所平民赵南说，在南朝鲜的失所平民要返乡，首先要得到当地警察署的许可才能去登记，他的许多朋友和邻居都愿意返乡，但是因为得不到警察署的许可，就没有办法回来。另一个失所平民朴春燮说：李承晚的特务、警察和宪兵轮流到各失所平民的家里去恐吓、威胁他们，不许他们登记返乡。
    今天，很多开城市民伫立在市郊通往板门店的公路两旁，迎接失所平民的归来。但是，他们感到悲痛和失望，因为他们的许多亲人被美方强迫扣留，没有能够回来。美方自称在南朝鲜的北部平民有一百五十万人。但在双方交换返乡平民的概数时，美方却说只有七十名左右的失所平民愿意返乡。以后这个数字又减少为三十八名。今天，实际回来的却只有三十七名，这还不到一百五十万人的四万分之一。
   【新华社平壤二日电】在战争期间有亲属被美李军队掳往南朝鲜的平壤市居民，都渴望着自己的亲人早日返乡团聚，过安居乐业的生活。
    平壤市齅兴二洞（龙兴二洞）居民、六十一岁的泥水匠李寅阔的儿子李安默（原在朝鲜绒衣工厂做工）在一九五零年十二月初即平壤解放前夕被美李匪军强迫掳往南朝鲜。虽然李寅阔一家五口人在政府的关怀和照顾下生活过得不坏，但是他们一直因为思念被敌人掳走的李安默而悲痛。他们都眼巴巴地盼望着自己的亲人归来。当他们听说在板门店双方已就协助失所平民返乡达成协议时，心中都充满了欢喜和希望。后来他们又听说美方只准备让七十名我方失所平民返乡，就非常痛心和失望。他们对美方强迫扣留平民的阴谋十分愤怒。李安默的妻子池亨实愤激地说：美李匪帮必须交还我们的亲人，这笔债是一定要还的。
    李寅阔的近邻金老太太的儿子金奉哲也在战争期间被敌人掳走。她与她的儿媳和两个小孙子一起过着孤苦伶仃的生活。金老太太日夜伤心流泪，盼望着自己的儿子回来，有时甚至在深夜里也呼唤着自己儿子的名字。她经常带着媳妇和孙儿到洞事务所（相当于里人民委员会）去打听失所平民返乡的消息。当她们听到美方不愿协助大批我方失所平民返乡的消息时，都激起了无限的悲愤。
    平壤市箕林一洞的居民，五十三岁的朴应涉老太太的儿子赵泰焕和女儿赵仁淑都被敌人掳走。她日夜思念着流离在外的儿女。她说：美李匪军活活拆散了我们美满的家庭，三年多了，他们还不放我的儿女回来，这仇恨是永远忘不了的。
    平壤西区的商人金学德、平壤东区的农民朴南镇、李政春等许多遭受同样不幸的家庭，也都痛斥美李匪帮掳掠和强迫扣留平民的罪行，坚决要求美方遵守双方协议，迅速协助我方失所平民返回家乡。
