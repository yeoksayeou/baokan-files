Our Country's First Dance School's Teacher Training Class Begins

    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government is preparing to establish our country's first dance school in Beijing. Thanks to the assistance of Soviet dance art professors invited to our country, the dance school teacher training class, which prepares teachers for this school, officially began in late February.

    The training class is divided into four groups: Chinese classical dance, Chinese folk ethnic dance, ballet, and representative folk dance (including folk dances from various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and countries such as Italy and Spain). The first two groups are taught by experienced Chinese opera teachers and excellent folk artists, while the latter two groups are taught by Soviet professors. The training class has more than fifty graduate students, drawn from dance art workers with considerable skill from four units in the Central and North China regions. Their study period is five months. In addition to dance courses, they will also study courses such as literary and artistic theory, pedagogy, music, and anatomy. The training class will train teachers for the dance school and, at the same time, students and teachers will jointly research and formulate teaching syllabuses for each grade of the dance school. Renowned Chinese dance artists Dai Ailian, Wu Xiaobang, Chen Jinqing, Sheng Jie, Ye Ning, and others have all participated in the work of the training class and will all study with the class.

    At the opening ceremony of the training class, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, attended and gave a speech. He pointed out that China's dance art has a history of thousands of years, and all ethnic groups have excellent traditions of dance art. After liberation, mass dance activities throughout the country were also widespread, but the lack of a formal dance school has affected the further improvement and development of dance art. He called on all graduate students to diligently study the advanced experience of Soviet dance art education, inherit the excellent traditions of our national dance art, and prepare for the successful establishment of our country's first dance school.

    Northeast People's Art Theater's Performance Plan for This Year

    The Northeast People's Art Theater has formulated its work plan and repertoire performance plan for 1954. The theater plans to create a new opera this year (rewriting based on "Spark"), create a children's play, one to two children's song and dance dramas, create more than twenty choruses, storytelling songs, mass songs, and instrumental ensemble pieces, reorganize and adapt two folk dances and two children's dances each, and revise the play "Crossroads."

    In terms of performing programs, in order to ensure the quality of the performances, each new repertoire will take two to three months to rehearse, so that actors have time to experience life, study policies, and engage in artistic creation. The repertoire planned for the first half of the year includes nine plays such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Dawn Shines on Moscow," and "On the Other Side," as well as the operas "The White-Haired Girl" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," as well as music, dance programs, and children's programs. In total, the newly arranged programs and reorganized original programs can organize eighteen to twenty performances with no repetition of content.

    The Northeast People's Art Theater has also decided that from January to mid-April, in addition to ensuring theater performances, all business units of the theater will spend all their time studying the general line, the literary and artistic theory of socialist realism, and professional knowledge related to drama, music, and dance.

    In addition, it is also planned to open a director research class to tutor the businesses of provincial and municipal drama troupes, and it is stipulated that each troupe of the theater should select two factories or rural areas in Shenyang City as the focus of tutoring mass cultural activities.

    Make Friends with Workers

    From July to the end of last year, the Chongqing Municipal Cultural Administrative Department organized eleven drama, ballad, and acrobatics troupes to perform in various factories, mines, and basic construction sites, performing 270 performances of Sichuan opera "The Story of Willow Shade," Beijing opera "Three Attacks on Zhu Village," opera "Little White Rabbit," drama "Women Representatives," dance "Picking Tea and Catching Butterflies," ballad "Master He Bingshan," and other programs, with more than 400,000 viewers. These performances were welcomed by the workers and boosted the workers' production enthusiasm. In addition to performing for the workers, the drama and ballad troupes that went to the factories and mines also established tutoring groups to carry out a series of tutoring work, helping the workers revise their works and helping the workers rehearse plays, thereby greatly enlivening the factory and mine cultural activities. While touring and performing, the drama and ballad workers also visited factories, listened to reports from labor models, and made friends with the workers. When they saw the steelworkers working intensely beside the open-hearth furnace at a temperature of over a thousand degrees, and saw the workers' courageous self-sacrifice and selfless spirit in overcoming difficulties, they were greatly inspired in their own thinking. Many actors criticized their own mistakes of being divorced from the masses and not asking about politics, and young artists changed their erroneous attitude of disrespecting teachers, thereby strengthening their internal unity and their devotion to their professions.

    Cultivate a New Force in the Literary World

    In order to regularly cultivate amateur young authors, the Northeast Writers Association holds amateur literary research classes and amateur literary training classes. In the amateur literary research class held last year, some students had a higher level and asked to study works and creative problems, while some students had a lower level and asked for more lectures to learn basic literary knowledge. Based on this requirement, it was decided to divide them into two classes this year: the amateur literary research class will focus on organizing students to study works and creative problems; the amateur literary training class will focus on lectures to learn the basic knowledge of literary creation. The lecturers will be writers Cao Ming, Shu Qun, Cai Tianxin, and others.

    The amateur literary training class will have lectures once a month, with 200 students; the amateur literary research class will have research once a month, with 40 students, selected from the original literary research class students and young amateur authors in Shenyang City.

    提高艺术修养，加强艺术实践
    我国第一所舞蹈学校的教员训练班开学
    中央人民政府文化部正在北京筹办我国的第一所舞蹈学校。由于应邀来我国的苏联舞蹈艺术教授的帮助，为这所学校准备师资的舞蹈学校教员训练班，二月底已正式开学。
    训练班分中国古典舞蹈、中国民间民族舞蹈、巴蕾舞、代表性民间舞蹈（包括苏联各民族、各人民民主国家以及意大利、西班牙等国的民间舞蹈）等四个组，前两个组分别聘请国内有经验的戏曲教员和优秀的民间艺人担任教学，后两个组由苏联教授担任教学。训练班有研究生五十多人，是从中央和华北的四个单位抽调的具有相当水平的舞蹈艺术工作者。他们的学习期间是五个月，除学习舞蹈课程外，还要学习文艺理论、教育学、音乐、解剖学等课程。训练班要为舞蹈学校训练教员，同时还要师生一起共同研究制订舞蹈学校各年级的教学大纲。我国著名舞蹈工作者戴爱莲、吴晓邦、陈锦清、盛婕、叶宁等都参加了训练班的工作，并都将随班学习。
    在训练班的开学典礼上，中央人民政府文化部副部长周扬曾出席讲话。他指出：我国的舞蹈艺术有几千年的历史，各民族都有优秀的舞蹈艺术传统，解放后全国的群众舞蹈活动也很普遍，但始终因为没有一所正规的舞蹈学校，所以影响了舞蹈艺术进一步的提高与发展。他号召全体研究生努力学习苏联舞蹈艺术教育的先进经验，继承我国民族舞蹈艺术的优秀传统，为办好我国的第一所舞蹈学校作好准备。
    东北人民艺术剧院的今年上演计划
    东北人民艺术剧院已订出一九五四年的工作计划和剧目上演计划。该院全年计划创作新歌剧一出（以“星星之火”为基础重写），创作儿童话剧一出，儿童歌舞剧一至二出，创作合唱、说唱、群众歌曲、器乐合奏曲等二十余篇，整理和改编民间舞蹈和儿童舞蹈各两个，修改话剧“十字路口”。
    在上演节目方面，为保证演出质量，每一新剧目将要用两个月到三个月的时间来排演，这样可使演员有时间体验生活，学习政策，从事艺术创造。上半年计划上演的剧目有：话剧“春风吹到诺敏河”、“曙光照耀着莫斯科”、“在那一边”等九个剧目，歌剧“白毛女”“小二黑结婚”以及音乐、舞蹈节目、儿童节目等。综计新排的节目和整理原有节目，可组织十八场到二十场内容毫不重复的演出。
    东北人民艺术剧院还决定自一月到四月中旬，除保证剧场演出外，全剧院各业务单位均将以全部时间学习总路线、社会主义现实主义的文艺理论和有关戏剧、音乐、舞蹈的专业知识。
    此外，还准备开办一期导演研究班，辅导各省、市剧团的业务，并规定该剧院每个团都要在沈阳市选择工厂或农村两处，做为辅导群众文艺活动的重点。
    跟工人交朋友
    重庆市文化行政部门从去年七月起到年底止，组织了十一个戏剧、曲艺、杂技团体到各厂矿及基本建设工地表演，演出了川剧“柳荫记”、京剧“三打祝家庄”、歌剧“小白兔”、话剧“妇女代表”、舞蹈“采茶扑蝶”、曲艺“老师傅贺炳山”等节目二百七十场次，观众有四十多万人。这些演出，都受到工人的欢迎，鼓舞了工人的生产情绪。下厂矿的戏剧曲艺团体，除为工人演出外，还成立了辅导小组，进行一系列的辅导工作，帮助工人修改作品，帮助工人排戏，从而大大活跃了厂矿文艺活动。戏剧曲艺工作者在巡回演出的同时，也参观了工厂，听了劳动模范的报告，跟工人交了朋友。当他们看到炼钢工人在千余度高温的马丁炉旁紧张劳动的情形，看到工人们勇于自我牺牲，克服困难的大公无私的精神，自己思想上受到很大启发。许多演员对自己脱离群众不问政治的错误作了批判，青年艺人改变了对老师不尊重的错误态度，从而加强了他们内部的团结和对业务的钻研。
      培养文学界的新军
    东北作家协会为了经常地培养业余的青年作者，举办业余文学研究班和业余文学讲习班。在去年所办的业余文学研究班中，有的学员水平较高，要求研究作品与创作上的问题，有的学员水平较差，要求多讲课，学习文学的基本知识。根据这种要求，今年决定分作两班：业余文学研究班以组织学员研究作品与创作上的问题为主；业余文学讲习班则以讲课方式，学习文学创作的基本知识为主。讲师由作家草明、舒群、蔡天心等担任。
    业余文学讲习班每月听课一次，学员二百名；业余文学研究班每月研究一次，学员四十名，由原文学研究班学员及在沈阳市的青年业余作者中选取。
