Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 13th: Due to high school fees in South Korea, many students are unable to afford to attend school, and the number of dropouts is increasing daily. According to greatly reduced figures released by the Syngman Rhee puppet government, there are already as many as 610,000 school-age children out of school in South Korea.

Now, as the new school year starting in April approaches, the Syngman Rhee puppet government has decided that schools should collect more admission fees and tuition fees, etc. The admission fee for university students is 150,000 won, and the annual tuition fee is more than one million won. Admission fees and tuition fees for secondary schools have actually been charged at ten times their original rate. National schools will also charge fees at this rate. The Rhee gang is effectively using schools to extort money. For example, last autumn, the Rhee gang pre-collected a large amount of fees from students under the pretext of preparing for the winter, even charging each child in national school as much as 60,000 won. However, when winter came, the schools had no heating equipment. Most schools in Seoul did not have a ton of coal for the winter, and many students were too cold to attend classes.

Most South Korean people are unable to afford the huge cost of their children's education. According to Seoul's "Kyunghyang Shinmun," the principal of a national school in a certain county in Gyeonggi Province said that 75 percent of school-age children in the area where the school is located are out of school. A cartoon published in the South Korean magazine "Hope" says that for South Korean students to go to school is as difficult as pulling a fully loaded ox cart up a 90-degree slope.

### 南朝鲜六十多万学龄儿童失学

    南朝鲜六十多万学龄儿童失学
    【新华社平壤十三日电】南朝鲜学校费用高昂，学生无力入学，失学者日多。据李承晚伪政府发表的大为缩小的数字：南朝鲜已有失学的学龄儿童六十一万人之多。
    现在，从四月开始的新学年即将到来，李承晚伪政府已决定各学校要多收入学费和学费等，大学生入学费为伪币十五万圆，每年学费为一百多万圆。中等学校的入学费和学费实际上已按原来的十倍收费。国民学校也将按照这种比率收费。李匪帮实际上是利用学校来搜括钱财。例如去年秋季，李匪帮就借口准备过冬而向学生预收了大量的费用，甚至连国民学校的每个儿童也收六万圆之多。但到了冬天，学校并没有取暖设备。汉城市的大部分学校，冬季没有一吨煤，许多学生冻得不能上课。
    南朝鲜人民大多无力负担子女入学的巨额费用。据汉城“京乡新闻”说，京畿道某郡的国民学校校长说：该校所在地区内，学龄儿童有百分之七十五失学。在南朝鲜发行的“希望”杂志刊载了一幅漫画说南朝鲜的学生要上学，是和满载的牛车要拉上九十度的山坡一样困难。
