The Hejian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Hebei Province recently convened a meeting of cadres from the county and district in charge of cooperative building and cadres from the county committee's inspection teams to examine issues in the cooperative building work. From the reports of the cadres at the meeting, it was found that in some places, the policy of "relying on the firm alliance of poor and middle peasants, gradually developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants" had not been well implemented during the building of cooperatives. As a result, some cooperatives, in their development and recruitment of members, only wanted middle peasants and not poor peasants, creating a situation where middle peasants formed middle peasant cooperatives and poor peasants formed poor peasant cooperatives. In Yangliuzhuang, Ninth District, of the two cooperatives organized simultaneously, Zhao Fengzhi's cooperative had fourteen households, including two households of reformed rich peasants, two households of well-to-do middle peasants, and ten households of old middle peasants. Conversely, Yang Pinwen's cooperative found fourteen poor peasant households, but because their economic conditions were too poor, the cooperative could not be established. In addition, some cooperatives also absorbed landlords and rich peasants who had not reformed their class status. In Wang Jianzhang's cooperative in Nanyuzhuang, Ninth District, landlords and rich peasants who had not reformed their class status infiltrated and became cadres within the cooperative, seizing leadership positions. Furthermore, some cooperatives did not adhere well to the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, which also hindered the unity of middle and poor peasants. According to an inspection of six cooperatives in the First District, four cooperatives completely assessed land based on three grades: 300 catties for the first grade, 200 catties for the second grade, and 100 catties for the third grade. This difference was too large, obviously unreasonable, and affected the relationship between middle and poor peasants.

At the meeting, after everyone's discussion, it was believed that this deviation concerned the fundamental policy of the Party in the countryside and must be corrected. Therefore, the county committee required cadres to repeatedly publicize the general line and the Party's fundamental policy in the countryside, pointing out the important significance of the united production of middle and poor peasants for building socialism. Through necessary meetings, dispel the ideological knots of a few middle and poor peasants, raise their political awareness, and achieve united production between middle and poor peasants. To achieve this, it is also necessary to effectively correct the unreasonable systems of some cooperatives, and special attention should be paid to correcting the perfunctory approach in land assessment and shareholding, truly ensuring that no one suffers losses, so that both middle and poor peasants can benefit. The county committee pointed out that to truly achieve the goal of united production between poor and middle peasants, it is also necessary to clean out those landlords and rich peasants who have not reformed their class status from the cooperatives with the consent of the members.

    中共河北省河间县委检查建社工作
    加强对贫农中农团结生产的领导
    中共河北省河间县委于最近召开了县区建社干部和县委检查组干部会议，检查了建社工作中的问题。从会议上干部的汇报中发现，有些地方在建社中，没有很好地贯彻执行“依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，逐步发展互助合作，限制富农剥削”的政策，以致有的社发展和吸收社员时，只要中农不要贫农，造成中农成立中农社，贫农成立贫农社的现象。九区杨刘庄同时组织的两个社中，赵逢枝社十四户，内有两户改变成份的富农，两户富裕中农，十户老中农；相反的，杨品文社却找了十四户贫农，因为经济条件太差，社也没建立起来。另外，有些社把没改变成份的地主、富农也吸收进去。九区南于庄王建章社，就有没改变成份的地主、富农混入，还当了社内干部，夺取了领导地位。再就是有些社没有很好地坚持自愿互利原则，也妨害了中农、贫农的团结。据一区六个社的检查，有四个社土地完全按三级评，头级三百斤，二级二百斤，三级一百斤。这样，差额太大，显然不合理，也影响了中农、贫农的关系。
    会议上，经过大家研究，认为这一偏向，是关系着党在农村中的根本政策问题，必须加以纠正。为此，县委要求干部反复宣传总路线和党在农村中的根本政策，指出中农、贫农的团结生产，对建设社会主义的重要意义。通过必要的会议，解除少数中农、贫农的思想疙瘩，提高他们的政治觉悟，达到中农、贫农团结生产。要作到这一点，还必须切实纠正某些社不合理的制度，特别应注意纠正土地评产入股等工作中的潦草从事现象，真正做到互不吃亏，使中农、贫农都有利可得。县委指出，要使贫农、中农真正达到团结生产的目的，还要通过社员的同意清洗那些没改变成份的地主、富农出社。
