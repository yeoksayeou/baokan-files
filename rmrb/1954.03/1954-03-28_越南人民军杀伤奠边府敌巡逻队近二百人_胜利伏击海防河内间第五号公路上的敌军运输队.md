Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army repelled two probing offensives by enemy patrols in Dien Bien Phu on the 23rd and 24th. Nearly two hundred enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and two enemy aircraft, one tank, and two transport trucks were destroyed.

On March 23rd, two French army patrol teams from Dien Bien Phu, totaling over three hundred men and supported by tanks, attempted to launch probing offensives towards the west and south against Vietnamese People's Army positions. They were intercepted by the People's Army and suffered one hundred casualties. The enemy was forced to retreat, and two transport trucks were destroyed.

At the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army artillery bombarded the enemy's Hang Kong (formerly translated as Hong Ku) airport on the southern line of defense. An enemy helicopter caught fire after being hit.

On March 24th, an enemy patrol team of more than one company, supported by tanks, again advanced from Mang Qing on the central line of defense and Hang Kong on the southern line of defense, again attempting to carry out reconnaissance activities to the west and south. The People's Army counterattacked, killing or wounding approximately one hundred enemy soldiers. One enemy tank was destroyed, and the remaining enemy forces were completely repelled. The People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery units coordinated to strike at enemy air force activities, shooting down one enemy Dakota aircraft, killing all seven people on board.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: According to Vietnam News Agency, on the 23rd, the Vietnamese People's Army ambushed an enemy transport convoy 4 kilometers west of Kui Cha on Highway 5 connecting Haiphong and Hanoi. After five minutes of battle, the People's Army killed sixty-two enemy soldiers, destroyed eight enemy vehicles, and seized seven machine guns and several rifles.

On the 24th, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated the enemy stronghold of Chu Qian, located four kilometers southwest of Phu Ly, the provincial capital of Ha Nam province. Ninety-five enemy soldiers were killed or captured, and nine enemy machine guns and over one hundred rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Under the constant attacks of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army's vital transportation between Hanoi and Haiphong has encountered great difficulties.

According to United Press, the French military headquarters admitted that "individual trucks and cars can no longer travel on the main highway between Hanoi and Haiphong." At the same time, "trains can only run under the protection of tanks moving along the highway parallel to the railway line." French authorities also revealed that the French army may be forced to adopt air transport between Hanoi and Haiphong.
