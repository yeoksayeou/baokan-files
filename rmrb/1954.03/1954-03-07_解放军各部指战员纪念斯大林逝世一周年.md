Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: In various locations, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) agencies and units, with deep remembrance, launched a variety of mass commemorative activities on the 4th and 5th to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the world's working people.

The PLA units stationed in major cities in East China sent representatives to participate in the commemorative meetings held by the local CCP (Chinese Communist Party) committees. Many units stationed in remote areas, small cities, rural areas, and islands held report meetings. The heads of each unit reported to their cadres on Stalin's life and deeds, as well as Stalin's military theories, and called on all personnel to combine this with the study of the General Line, work harder to learn Stalin's theories on socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and learn the advanced Soviet military science created by Stalin. The PLA troops heroically guarding Dongshan Island in Fujian Province, while commemorating the first anniversary of the death of the great Stalin, expressed their determination to commemorate the great Stalin with practical actions to defend the construction of the motherland and world peace. The commanders and fighters of the Second Company of a certain unit, which was awarded the title of "First Class Meritorious Company in the Dongshan Battle," pledged to learn the General Line of the state during the transition period and to strive for its implementation. Many soldiers held special discussion meetings to discuss how to commemorate the great Stalin with practical actions. A naval unit of the PLA stationed on the coast of East China held a report meeting and a discussion meeting on the 5th. At the discussion meeting, they reviewed their achievements in work and study over the past year and further examined and revised their resolution plans. Zhao Xiao'an, a famous Navy Model Combatant, has successfully completed his resolution plan for 1953. He said: "In order to inherit Stalin's great cause, in order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, we must intensify our efforts to improve our political, technical and cultural levels, and strive to learn advanced Soviet military science. The Soviet Navy is our example to learn from." Shen Sufang, a working model and female dispatcher of a certain unit, wrote in her letter of determination last year: she is determined to fight to the end for Stalin's immortal cause. Over the past year, she has gained endless strength every time she thinks of this oath. Last year, she successfully completed her work tasks, was awarded the Second Class Merit and Grade B Model title for the third time, and gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Today, on the anniversary of Stalin's death, she further expressed her determination to always be loyal to the great cause of Lenin and Stalin and to strive for the gradual transition of the motherland to a beautiful socialist society. The entire command and fighters of the PLA's "Jinan First Regiment" wrote to Chairman Mao on March 5. The letter stated: One year ago, we followed your instructions to turn grief into strength, actively worked hard to learn the advanced Soviet military science and advanced experience of the Soviet army created by Stalin, and have now achieved certain results. Today, on the anniversary of Comrade Stalin's death, we are determined to achieve new and greater victories in learning.

The agencies and units of the PLA Southwest Military Region held commemorative meetings on the 5th, with heads of each department making commemorative reports. The Northwest Military Region held a meeting on the 5th to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of the great Stalin. The agencies and units of the PLA Central South Military Region stationed in Guangzhou participated in the commemorative meeting held by the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee on the evening of the 4th to commemorate the first anniversary of Stalin's death.

On the occasion of the first anniversary of the death of the great Stalin, newspapers and periodicals in many PLA units published editorials, articles, and pictures about Stalin to commemorate the first anniversary of his death. Many wall newspapers also published special issues commemorating the first anniversary of Stalin's death. Some units also held photo exhibitions introducing Stalin's life and deeds. Film projection teams in various units screened films about Stalin's life for the soldiers.
