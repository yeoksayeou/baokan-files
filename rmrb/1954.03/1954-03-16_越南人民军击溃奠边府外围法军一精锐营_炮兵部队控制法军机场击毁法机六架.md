Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the spokesman of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the 14th that the Vietnamese People's Army launched an attack near Dien Bien Phu on the 13th, completely annihilating a battalion of elite enemy troops defending Him Lam, and capturing the entire enemy headquarters personnel.

    At 4:00 PM on March 13th, the Vietnamese People's Army, with the coordination of artillery and anti-aircraft guns, launched an offensive against the French position at Him Lam, not far northeast of Dien Bien Phu. French artillery bombarded heavily, but to little avail. Under the intense fire of the Vietnamese People's Army's anti-aircraft artillery, the enemy's aircraft were also powerless. After two hours of artillery bombardment of the enemy, the Vietnamese People's Army infantry began their attack, and by 11:00 PM that night, they had completely annihilated the enemy's defending forces, a battalion, at Him Lam, capturing all of the enemy's command personnel.

    The spokesman said that Him Lam was the most fortified enemy position on the outskirts of Dien Bien Phu, protecting the road from Don Gian to Dien Bien Phu and the Dien Bien Phu airfield. The enemy defending this position was the 3rd Battalion of the Foreign Legion; this battalion was considered skilled in defensive warfare, and therefore was deployed by the French colonialists to defend this important position.

    The spokesman pointed out that this major victory was one of the largest-scale offensives launched by the Vietnamese People's Army against a strongly defended enemy position, and a victorious assault on a concentrated enemy stronghold.

    The spokesman concluded by saying that, at present, the Vietnamese People's Army artillery continues to control the two French airfields at Dien Bien Phu, and the Vietnamese People's Army infantry is tightly surrounding the enemy forces at Dien Bien Phu.

    Xinhua News Agency, March 15th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army bombarded enemy airfields around Dien Bien Phu with artillery, destroying six enemy aircraft in two days.

    At 4:00 PM on March 11th, just as enemy aircraft transporting supplies to the French forces besieged at Dien Bien Phu were landing at the Dien Bien Phu airfield, the People's Army artillery units fiercely bombarded the airfield with artillery fire. The first five shells hit a C-119 aircraft. This type of aircraft is a large transport plane that the United States "aided" the French colonialists with after their defeat in the Nam Ou River basin in Upper Laos. At the same time, a French Dakota aircraft that was landing was also hit; because this aircraft was loaded with shells, the explosions lasted for more than an hour, and the fuselage was blown to pieces. Another French Morane reconnaissance aircraft flew in to scout the position and was hit by the People's Army's anti-aircraft guns, caught fire, and crashed somewhere west of Dien Bien Phu.

    At 2:00 PM on March 12th, the People's Army artillery units again opened fire on the Dien Bien Phu airfield, at a time when many French aircraft were taking off. As a result, two Morane aircraft were hit and caught fire, and another reconnaissance aircraft was blown in half.

    At present, the Vietnamese People's Army artillery units continue to control the enemy airfield at Dien Bien Phu. The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army has awarded the unit that destroyed six enemy aircraft in two days with the Third Class Military Service Medal.

    越南人民军击溃奠边府外围法军一精锐营
    炮兵部队控制法军机场击毁法机六架
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人十四日宣布：越南人民军十三日向奠边府附近出击，全部击溃防守兴垄的敌军一营精锐部队，并俘掳敌军指挥部的全体人员。
    三月十三日下午四时，越南人民军在大炮和高射炮的配合下，向奠边府东北不远的兴垄法军阵地发动进攻。法国炮兵大肆轰击，然而发挥不了很大的作用；在越南人民军高射炮部队的猛烈炮火下，敌人的飞机也无能为力。在大炮对敌军轰击了两小时以后，越南人民军步兵开始进攻，到当天晚上十一点完全击溃了兴垄的敌军防守部队一个营，俘掳了敌军的全体指挥人员。
    发言人说，兴垄是敌军在奠边府外围防御最巩固的阵地，它掩护着敦交到奠边府的道路和奠边府的飞机场。防守这个阵地的敌军是外籍军团第三营；这营敌军被认为精于防御战，因此被法国殖民者调来防守这个重要的阵地。
    发言人指出，这次重大的胜利是越南人民军向敌军防御坚强的阵地发动的最大规模的进攻之一，并且是对敌人密集的防御据点一次胜利的袭击。
    发言人最后说，目前，越南人民军炮兵继续控制着奠边府法军两个飞机场，越南人民军步兵正在紧紧地包围着奠边府的敌军。
    【新华社十五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军在奠边府周围以大炮轰击敌军机场，两天中击毁敌机六架。
    三月十一日下午四时，正当为被包围在奠边府的法军空运供应品的敌机在奠边府机场降落时，人民军炮兵部队以炮火向这个机场猛烈轰击。头五发炮弹即击中了一架C一一九型飞机。这种飞机是法国殖民者在上寮南乌江流域遭受失败后美国“援助”他们的一种大型运输机。在这同时，一架正在着陆的法军达科他式飞机也被击中；由于这架飞机装载着炮弹，爆炸声响了一个多小时，机身炸得粉碎。另一架法军莫兰式侦察机飞来侦察阵地，也被人民军的高射炮击中起火，在奠边府以西某处触地撞毁。
    三月十二日下午二时，人民军炮兵部队又向奠边府机场开火，当时正有许多架法国飞机起飞。结果两架莫兰式飞机中弹着火，另一架侦察机被击成两半。
    目前，越南人民军炮兵部队继续控制着奠边府敌军机场。越南人民军总司令部已以三级军功章授予在两天内击毁敌机六架的部队。
