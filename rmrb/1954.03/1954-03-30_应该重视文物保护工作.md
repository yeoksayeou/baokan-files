    The Protection of Cultural Relics Should Be Emphasized
    Reader Jing Hongjun's letter: The Nanyang County Culture and Education Section in Henan Province does not pay enough attention to the protection of cultural relics. From the spring of last year to the end of October, more than 20 incidents of destroying ancient tombs and cultural sites occurred in the county. Tan Gang Township in the Twelfth District of the county is the site of ancient human remains from the Neolithic Age over 4,000 years ago. One discovered site covers an area of over 120 mu, with a cultural layer of gray soil more than two meters thick, containing extremely rich cultural relics. Last autumn, an unscrupulous element, Zhang Zigeng, deceived the farmers by saying that the years of gray soil could fertilize the fields, and let the masses buy the soil. As a result, the daily average of vehicles hauling gray soil was about 80, and at most, it reached more than 200, causing serious damage to the ancient site. Zhang Zigeng even openly posted announcements in the area saying that "any gold, silver, treasures, ancient bronze wares, or jade objects unearthed from the ground will belong to the owner." This situation lasted for two months, but the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section turned a blind eye. After the Henan Provincial Cultural Bureau discovered this, it immediately sent a telegram to the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section, ordering them to investigate and stop it immediately. However, the section did not deal with it seriously. The Provincial Cultural Bureau urged them three times in a row, but the section remained indifferent. Later, when the Provincial Cultural Bureau sent a special person to investigate, the head of the county's Culture and Education Section still shirked responsibility, using the excuse that "the section has too many things to do, and cannot spare the staff." Therefore, the Henan Provincial Cultural Bureau notified the whole province of this matter on January 9th and gave the relevant personnel of the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section the punishment they deserved.
    However, the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section still did not learn a lesson from this serious incident. Recently, Wu Shanchun, a farmer in the Qiaotou District of the county, was preparing to build a house. When he was laying the foundation, he discovered a layer of gray soil the size of three rooms, containing pottery fragments and various ancient artifacts. Therefore, he entrusted someone to write a letter to the county's Culture and Education Section, requesting protection and handling. As a result, the county's Culture and Education Section ignored it. Wu Shanchun had to personally report to the Provincial Cultural Bureau in Kaifeng City. In addition to praising Wu Shanchun's spirit of protecting cultural relics, the Provincial Cultural Bureau has once again ordered the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section to conduct an inspection.
    In my opinion, the irresponsible attitude of the Nanyang County Culture and Education Section towards the protection of cultural relics is extremely wrong. They should seriously study the central government's policies on the protection of cultural relics and earnestly strengthen the protection of cultural relics in the future.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该重视文物保护工作
    读者井鸿钧来信：河南省南阳县文教科不重视保护文物工作。从去年春季到十月底止，该县曾连续发生破坏古墓和文化遗址的事件二十余起。该县十二区谭岗乡系四千余年前新石器时代古人类遗址，已发现的一处面积有一百二十余亩，文化层灰土厚二公尺以上，其中文物极为丰富。去年秋天，不法分子张子庚欺骗农民说是多年灰土可以肥田，让群众来买土。于是，每日拉灰土的车辆平均在八十辆左右，最多时曾达二百多辆，古代遗址受到严重破坏。张子庚并公然在该岗张贴告白，说是“地中如挖出金银财宝古铜玉器等物，概归本主所得”。这种情况延续两个月之久，而南阳县文教科却不闻不问。河南省文化局发觉后，当即电令南阳县文教科速予调查制止。但该科并不认真处理。省文化局曾连催三次，该科仍置若罔闻。后省文化局派专人前往调查时，该县文教科长仍以“科里事多，站不上队”为借口来推卸责任。因此河南省文化局就在一月九日把这件事通报全省，并给南阳县文教科有关人员以应得处分。
    但是，南阳县文教科仍没有从这一严重事件中接受教训，最近该县桥头区农民吴山春准备盖房，在打基时发现三间屋大的灰土层，里面有陶片和各种古器。于是，他就托人写信向县文教科报告，要求保护处理。结果县文教科置之不理。吴山春不得不亲自到开封市向省文化局报告。省文化局除了表扬吴山春爱护文物的精神外，已再次责令南阳县文教科进行检查。
    我认为，南阳县文教科对文物保护工作的不负责态度是极其错误的，他们应该认真学习中央关于保护文物的政策，并在今后切实加强文物保护工作。
