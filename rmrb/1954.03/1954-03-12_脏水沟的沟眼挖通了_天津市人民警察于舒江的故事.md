The Drain of the Dirty Ditch Has Been Dug Open
——The Story of Tianjin People's Policeman Yu Shujiang
　　Wu Yi

　　One evening during the rainy season of 1953.

　　After several days of continuous rain, the streets and alleys of Tianjin were filled with rainwater. The drain of the dirty ditch behind the New Goods Factory in the Third District was blocked by coal cinder, horse manure, garbage, and other debris washed in by the rainwater, preventing the rainwater from flowing out. The New Li Hutong and Gongyi Hutong, adjacent to the ditch, were located in a low-lying area, and rainwater accumulated in the hutongs, flooding into the residents' courtyards. Representatives of the residents of New Li Hutong hurriedly reported this situation to the Zhongshan Road Police Station in the Third District, requesting assistance in resolving the problem.

　　At this time, Yu Shujiang, a policeman from the Zhongshan Road Police Station, had already been running in the rain for most of the night, inspecting dangerous houses and rescuing residents. He had just returned to the police station to rest when he heard about the situation and immediately went with another policeman, Xiao Yusheng, to inspect the scene. It turned out that this ditch was used for draining dirty water and, during rain, it also carried rainwater. Rainwater from the New Goods Factory, the Water Ladder area, and other places all flowed into this ditch. Now that the drain was blocked, the water surface was covered with floating feces and garbage, and the water had turned blackish-yellow, becoming dirty and smelly. Yu Shujiang watched as the rainwater continued to rise, soaking the houses deeper and deeper. The houses in the Gongyi Hutong area were mostly old and dilapidated earthen structures, and if the water continued to rise, there was a risk of collapse. He was very anxious and determined to find a way to dig open the drain. At this moment, Xiao Yusheng borrowed an iron shovel, and the two of them used it to try to clear the drain. However, the water was deep, and the shovel couldn't reach the drain, so they couldn't clear it after working for a long time. The situation became increasingly critical, and the residents' houses were in imminent danger. Yu Shujiang thought: I am a people's policeman and a Communist Party member. For the sake of the safety of the lives and property of dozens of residents, can I not overcome such a small difficulty? At this moment, the images of countless Chinese People's Volunteer Army heroes flashed through his mind: Huang Jiguang, who blocked the enemy's gun muzzle with his chest, Luo Shengjiao, who selflessly rescued a Korean child who had fallen into an ice cave... They all protected the interests of the people with their blood and lives. Thinking of this, he unhesitatingly took off his raincoat and, regardless of the dirt and cold, jumped into the dirty ditch. He first stomped on the drain with his feet. There was a lot of debris inside, and he couldn't move it. Instead, it gathered around him. To clear the drain, he had to put his head under the dirty water and use his hands to pull out all kinds of debris. Yu Shujiang didn't hesitate at all. He immediately dived into the water, feeling for the drain and using all his strength to pull out handful after handful of weeds. He came up for air, took a deep breath, and then dived back into the water to dig. He dived into the water six times in a row before opening a hole in the drain.

　　Xiao Yusheng, standing above, saw that the accumulated water had started to flow into the ditch and quickly called out to Yu Shujiang, "Okay, come up!" However, Yu Shujiang felt that the drain had not been completely cleared and that the water was flowing too slowly, fearing that it would be blocked again soon. So, he dived into the water for the seventh time and used his last bit of strength to completely clear the drain before climbing out. The sewage swirled away, and the houses in the Gongyi Hutong area were spared the danger of collapsing. Although Yu Shujiang was covered in dirt, he was very happy to see that the drain was clear and the rainwater was flowing away. The residents of the Gongyi Hutong area were even more grateful for his spirit of serving the masses with such dedication. At the recent commendation meeting held by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau to honor model people's policemen and celebrate achievements, Comrade Yu Shujiang was awarded the title of Third-Class Merit Policeman.

    脏水沟的沟眼挖通了
    ——天津市人民警察于舒江的故事
  　吴怡
    一九五三年雨季的一个晚上。
    接连下了几天雨，天津市的大街小巷积满了雨水。三区新货厂后面的脏水沟的沟眼，被雨水冲进去的煤渣、马粪、垃圾等物堵住了，雨水流不出去。挨着沟的新立胡同和公义胡同地势低洼，雨水积满了胡同，涌入了居民的院里。新立胡同的居民代表，急忙把这一情况报告了三区中山路派出所，请求帮助解决这个问题。
    这时，中山路派出所的民警于舒江，因为到各处检查危险房屋、救护居民，已经在雨地里奔跑了多半夜。他刚回到派出所休息，听到了这个情况，马上就和另一个民警萧玉胜跑到出事地点去察看。原来这个沟是走脏水的，下雨时就走雨水。新货厂、水梯子一带的雨水都往这儿走。现在沟眼被堵住了，水面上漂浮着一些粪块和垃圾等污物，水都变成了黑黄色，又脏又臭。于舒江眼看着雨水不断地往上涨，房子被水越泡越深，而公义胡同这一带都是些老朽的土房子，水要是再继续涨，就有倒塌的危险。他心里很着急，决心要想个办法挖通沟眼。这时，萧玉胜借来一把铁锨，他们两人就用铁锨扒沟眼，可是水很深，铁锨够不着沟眼，扒了半天也没有扒开。情势越发危急了，居民的房屋眼看就要发生危险。于舒江想：自己是人民警察，又是共产党员，为了几十户居民的生命财产的安全，难道这么点困难还不能克服吗？这时，无数中国人民志愿军英雄的形象浮现在他脑子里：用胸膛堵住敌人炮眼的黄继光，舍身抢救掉进冰窟的朝鲜儿童的罗盛教……他们都是用鲜血和生命保护着人民的利益。想到这里，他毫不犹豫地脱下雨衣，不顾脏和凉，跳进了脏水沟。他先用脚蹬蹬沟眼，里面的污物很多，蹬也蹬不动，反而向他围拢来。要想弄通沟眼，必须把头钻到脏水里，用手扒出各种污物。于舒江一点也没有犹豫，一下就钻到了水底，用手摸着沟眼，用全身力气扒出一把一把的乱草。露出头来深深地吸口气，接着又钻到水里去掏。这样一连钻入水底六次，才把沟眼扒开了一个洞。
    站在上面的萧玉胜看见积水开始往沟里流了，便连忙招呼于舒江说：“行了，上来吧！”但是，于舒江觉得沟眼还没有完全掏净，水流得还很慢，恐怕过会儿又要被堵住。于是，他第七次又钻入水底，使出最后的力气，把沟眼完全掏通了，他才爬了上来。污水打着漩涡流走了，公义胡同一带的房屋免除了倒塌的危险。于舒江虽然全身沾满了脏东西，但他看着沟眼通了，雨水流走了，他的心里很高兴。公义胡同一带的居民们更是非常感激他这种高度为群众服务的精神。在最近天津市人民政府公安局召开的表扬模范人民警察和庆功大会上，于舒江同志荣获了三等功民警的称号。
