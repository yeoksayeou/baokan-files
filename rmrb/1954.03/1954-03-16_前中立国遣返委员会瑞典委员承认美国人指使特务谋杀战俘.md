Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: According to Indian news sources, Major General Stenstrem, the Swedish member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, openly admitted to reporters in Bombay on March 10th while en route home from Korea, that American-directed special agents murdered prisoners of war who requested repatriation. He said that some Americans "were significantly involved in harassment in some prisoner-of-war camps, and this cannot be completely denied. Some of these Americans tried to indoctrinate the prisoners, which resulted in murders in the prisoner-of-war camps."

On March 11th, the Swedish member modified the phrase "Americans" he had used on March 10th to "representatives of the United Nations." In fact, after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over, it was the Americans who acted as so-called "representatives" of the United Nations forces in the Korean demilitarized zone and were in charge of the prisoner-of-war issue. Regardless of what name the Swedish member uses, this is further proof that Americans instigated and caused murders in the prisoner-of-war camps.

    前中立国遣返委员会瑞典委员承认美国人指使特务谋杀战俘
      【新华社十三日讯】据印度新闻处报道，中立国遣返委员会瑞典委员斯坦斯特鲁少将三月十日在从朝鲜返国途中到达孟买时，对记者公开承认美国指使的特务谋杀要求遣返的战俘。他说：有一些美国人“和一些战俘营中的骚扰有很大关系，这一点是不能完全否认的。这些美国人当中有些人曾试图向战俘进行思想灌输，结果造成了战俘营中的谋杀事件。”
    这个瑞典委员在三月十一日又把他在三月十日所说的“美国人”三字修改为“联合国代表们”字样。其实，当中立国遣返委员会接管后，在朝鲜非军事区充当联合国军的所谓“代表”管战俘问题的就是美国人。不管瑞典委员用什么名称，美国人主使并造成战俘营谋杀事件又得到一次证明。
