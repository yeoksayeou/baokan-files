Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: News from Washington indicates that the U.S. authorities are impatiently trying to prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina and further interfere in this war. The U.S. government officially announced on the 12th the appointment of O'Daniel as the head of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina. This is a step in the recently rumored plan for the U.S. to further participate in the war. It is said that the U.S. is sending O'Daniel to Indochina to strengthen control over the war, especially to strengthen control over the Indochinese puppet army. Although France recently expressed coolness towards this move by the U.S. and demanded that the U.S. affirm that O'Daniel would not interfere in the training of local troops, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford blatantly stated when announcing O'Daniel's appointment: If France is willing, the U.S. will be "happy" to take over the training of Indochinese troops.
The U.S. plan to prevent the restoration of peace in Indochina has been revealed in a dispatch from Washington on the 12th by United Press reporter Wilson. Wilson said that the U.S. authorities will not hesitate to "pay a heavy price" to continue the war in Indochina. The "countermeasures" taken by the U.S. are: 1. "Avoid negotiating peace on any basis"; 2. "Keep France in Indochina" to continue playing the role of pulling chestnuts out of the fire for U.S. interests; 3. According to the policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," "encourage local residents to fight against communism" in Indochina; 4. Instigate the puppet groups in Indochina to break away from France and become "independent" so that the U.S. can directly control them. Wilson said: The mood in France to get rid of the Indochina war is very strong, "this war is unpopular among the French, just like the Korean War is unpopular among the Americans," therefore, "those who are wholeheartedly" wanting to fight on and achieve "victory" in Indochina, "are the Americans rather than the French."

### 美国派奥丹尼尔去印度支那

    美国派奥丹尼尔去印度支那
    【新华社十四日讯】来自华盛顿的消息表明美国当局正迫不及待地要阻止恢复印度支那和平，并进一步干涉这个战争。美国政府十二日正式宣布任命奥丹尼尔为美国驻印度支那“军事援助顾问团”团长。这是不久前传闻的美国进一步参预战争的计划的一个步骤。据说，美国派奥丹尼尔去印度支那，为的是加强对战争的控制，特别是加强对印度支那傀儡军队的控制。尽管法国最近对美国此举表示冷淡，并要求美国肯定奥丹尼尔不去干涉训练当地的军队，但美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在宣布奥丹尼尔的任命时仍露骨地表示：如果法国愿意，美国将“乐于”接手训练印度支那军队。
    美国防止恢复印度支那和平的计划已由合众社记者威尔逊十二日从华盛顿发出的消息中透露出来。威尔逊说，美国当局将不惜“付出重大的代价”以继续进行印度支那的战争。美国所采取的“对策”是：一、“避免在任何基础上商订和平”；二、“使法国留在印度支那”，使它继续充当为美国利益火中取栗的角色；三、根据“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，在印度支那“鼓舞当地居民去对共产主义作战”；四、嗾使印度支那的傀儡集团脱离法国“独立”，以便美国能直接控制它们。威尔逊说：法国国内要摆脱印度支那战争的情绪是很激烈的，“这场战争在法国人中间不得人心，正如朝鲜战争在美国人中间不得人心一样”，因此，“一心一意”想要在印度支那打下去并取得“胜利”的，“与其说是法国，不如说是美国”。
