The lecturer group of Hunan provincial level organs has been established for more than two years, and has been working continuously except during the "Three-Anti" period. In early December 1951, under the direct leadership of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Changsha Marxist-Leninist Night School was founded, aiming to train theory teachers and study tutors for provincial and municipal organs. Twenty leading comrades with higher theoretical levels from provincial and municipal organs formed a lecturer group (part-time) to be responsible for teaching the history of the Communist Party of China at the night school. At this stage, the teaching system was relatively standardized, with lectures once or twice a week. After the "Three-Anti" movement, half of the lecturer group members were transferred away, and the teaching system was no longer standardized, but lectures were still given once or twice in each study unit.

In July 1953, the theoretical study of cadres throughout the province began relatively formally. Under the instruction of the Provincial Party Committee, the lecturer group was reorganized. The new lecturer group members included Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhu Fan, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, Tang Lin, Deputy Minister, Yang Difu, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, Mao Yuanyao, Director of the Provincial Department of Industry, and other leading cadres of provincial-level organs, totaling 38 people (including 20 at the department director level and above, and 18 at the division and bureau director level). The lecturer group was divided into two groups: one group of 23 people was responsible for lecturing on Chapters 9 to 12 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" at the provincial-level organs' intermediate-level spare-time political school; the other group of 15 people was responsible for lecturing on the "Reader of Political Common Sense" at the "Primary Level Theory Teachers' Seminar" attached to the school. Since then, the work and teaching system of the lecturer group have become more standardized. From July to November last year, the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" was lectured up to Section 3 of Chapter 9, with a total of five lectures and thirteen class sessions; the "Reader of Political Common Sense" was lectured up to Chapter 3, with six class sessions.

Since December, cadres throughout the province have begun to study the Party's general line during the transition period, and the lecturer group has also undertaken the task of lecturing on this course. It has now given three lectures in the advanced group and a total of five lectures in the intermediate-level spare-time political school.

The lecturer group has played a significant role in providing theoretical guidance for the study of cadres in provincial-level organs. Its role was particularly significant in the study of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." At that time, more than 1,800 intermediate-level cadres from all provincial-level organs and more than 300 backbone members from the intermediate-level group in Changsha City participated in the study at the provincial-level organs' intermediate-level spare-time political school. Most of the more than 200 senior-level cadres from provincial-level organs also participated in the lectures. Thanks to the lecturer group's planned lectures, cadres received systematic guidance in their studies, enabling the studies to gradually deepen and achieve greater results in a short period. For example, at the beginning of the study, we learned that many cadres had not read the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in the past and knew very little about the history of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so they felt confused in their studies. We organized three lecturers to give a general introduction to the main contents of each chapter before Chapter 9, so that cadres could find the context, which was of great benefit to the study of Chapter 9. In the study of Chapter 9, the lecturers gave detailed explanations on specific topics, inducing and inspiring cadres to better understand the main text, and to more deeply understand the Soviet Union's experience in economic construction and several major issues in China's economic construction, in accordance with the method of combining theory with practice, and to a certain extent solved the difficulties encountered by cadres in their studies, such as "not being able to delve into," "not being able to digest," and "not being able to systematize." The lecturer group also played a very important role in holding the primary-level theory teachers' seminar. The participants in the seminar included primary-level theory teachers from provincial and municipal organs and all primary-level study tutors from provincial-level organs, totaling 1,100 people, all of whom were the guides and backbone of primary-level study; however, most of them had insufficient theoretical level and insufficient preparation time. With lecturers lecturing at the seminar, they had the opportunity to learn one step ahead before teaching and tutoring; in particular, the lecturers clearly pointed out the teaching points and requirements of each chapter in the lectures and provided teaching examples, which greatly improved the teaching and tutoring level of the primary-level theory teachers and tutors, and thus greatly promoted the study of all primary-level cadres.

In order to do a good job in the lecturer group, we have taken the following measures:

First, under the call and support of the Party Committee, give full play to the enthusiasm of the lecturers. The Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to the work of the lecturer group and often urges it. Each lecturer is given appropriate remuneration for each lecture as an encouragement. Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, not only mobilized other lecturers to actively lecture, but also took the lead in lecturing to cadres many times. Although the members of the lecturer group are all leading cadres and have busy work, most of them attach great importance to their tasks and are active and conscientious in lecturing and preparing lessons. For example, Comrade Yang Difu, Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Committee, sometimes prepares lessons until late at night. When explaining Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," he carefully read the relevant works of Lenin and Stalin, repeatedly studied them, found theoretical basis, and focused on in-depth study, so that cadres could gain deeper inspiration from the spirit of the documents, and appropriately linked the actual situation of the Chinese revolution and the Party's current policies and policies, so that cadres generally felt that the content of the lectures was rich and systematic, and the explanation was popular and vivid. The enthusiasm of the lecturers has continuously improved the quality of teaching.

Second, the departments responsible for the study of leading cadres provide specific assistance to the lecturers in many ways. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Directly Affiliated Party Committee, and the Academic Affairs Office of the Intermediate Group Spare-time Political School have paid more attention to this aspect. Before the lecturers give lectures, they send people to contact them many times or specifically help the lecturers prepare lessons. In this regard, the following things have been mainly done: (1) Determine the topics and time of the lectures as early as possible and notify the lecturers so that they can be prepared; (2) Propose requirements for the lectures to the lecturers in advance, thereby improving their lecturing effect; (3) Fully provide reference materials; (4) Collect the ideological situation and difficult problems of cadres in their studies and provide them to the lecturers for reference, so that they can "shoot the arrow at the target" when lecturing.

Third, collectively study and carefully review the lecturers' lecturing outlines. This is an important key to ensuring the quality of teaching. The lecturers of the Intermediate Group Spare-time Political School are mostly members of the Senior Group Central Group of provincial-level organs. Therefore, before lecturing, they generally propose their lecturing outlines during the discussion of the central group (the central group learns one step ahead of the general senior group and intermediate group) and regard it as the central speech of the group, and then everyone discusses, supplements, or revises it. This not only helps the study of the central group, but also conducts a collective study and review of the lecturers' lecturing outlines, which is both convenient and easy to implement and can achieve good results. The experience since the study of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" proves that this method is worth continuing to adopt in the future. Secondly, before lecturing, the lecturers of the Primary Group Theory Teachers' Seminar formulate lecturing outlines and submit them to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee for review; after lecturing, they refer to the reflections of the students and revise and issue them in a timely manner.

In order to do a better job in the lecturer group, we should pay attention to the following issues in the future:

First, in the past, although there were many people in the lecturer group, only a few lecturers who had been proven to be popular with the students were always invited to lecture. Only nine people have lectured since the study of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." The circle is too small, making these few people too busy. In the future, in addition to appropriately adjusting the organization of the lecturer group, we should also pay attention to expanding the circle of lecturers.

Second, further improve the study of the senior group central group of provincial-level organs, improve its study system, and insist on learning one step ahead of the general senior group. The backbone of the lecturer group is in the central group. If the study of the central group is done well, the teaching level of the lecturers will be improved. Before the lecturers lecture to the intermediate group, they must submit the lecturing outlines to the central group for discussion. Lecturers who are not members of the central group can invite him to the central group to propose his lecturing outlines for everyone to discuss or invite him to participate in the lectures before he lectures.

Third, the departments responsible for the study of leading cadres should further strengthen specific assistance to the lecturers. In particular, the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee should have someone to do this.

Fourth, in the past, the departments responsible for the study of leading cadres rarely helped the lecturers in terms of teaching methods. In the future, these departments should pay attention to summarizing and promoting the good teaching experience of the lecturers and can hold lecturer symposiums at certain times to exchange experience; in addition, they should also collect the students' opinions on the lecturers' teaching methods and provide them to the lecturers for reference and improvement.

Fifth, in the past, due to the poor management of the departments responsible for the study of leading cadres, the work of the lecturer group seemed to be tight and loose, the planning was not thorough, and some lecturers temporarily shirked, which sometimes affected the entire teaching plan. This must be improved in the future so that the work of the lecturer group can be carried out more regularly and in a planned manner.

    湖南省省级机关的讲师团工作
    中共湖南省委宣传部
    我省省级机关讲师团建立已两年有余，除“三反”期间外，一直没有间断地工作着。一九五一年十二月初，在中共湖南省委和中共长沙市委直接领导下，创办了旨在培养省、市机关理论教员和学习辅导员的长沙市马克思列宁主义夜校，以省、市机关负责同志中理论水平较高的二十人组成讲师团（兼职），在夜校负责讲授中共党史。这一阶段，教学制度比较正规，每周讲课一次到两次。“三反”运动后讲师团成员半数已调走，教学制度也不正规，但每一学习单元仍讲课一两次。
    一九五三年七月，全省的干部理论学习比较正规的开始了，在省委指示下，改组了讲师团。新的讲师团成员包括省委书记周小舟、省委宣传部长朱凡、副部长唐麟、省委秘书长杨第甫、省工业厅厅长毛远耀等省级机关领导干部共三十八人（其中厅长级以上者二十人，处、局长十八人）。讲师团分为两大组：一组二十三人，在省级机关中级组业余政治学校负责讲授“联共（布）党史”第九至十二章；另一组十五人，在该校附设的“初级组理论教员讲座”负责讲授“政治常识读本”。自此，讲师团的工作和教学制度即趋向正规。去年七月至十一月，“联共（布）党史”讲至第九章第三节，共五讲，讲课十三次；“政治常识读本”讲至第三章，讲课六次。
    十二月起，全省干部开始学习党在过渡时期的总路线，讲师团又担负起此一课程的讲授任务，现已在高级组讲了三次课，在中级组业余政治学校讲了共五次课。
    讲师团对省级机关干部学习的理论指导起了重大的作用。在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章时，所起作用尤其显著。当时，参加省级机关中级组业余政治学校学习的，包括了省级机关全体中级组干部一千八百多人和长沙市中级组中的骨干分子三百多人。省级机关的二百多名高级组干部，也多数参加旁听。由于有了讲师团按计划地进行讲课，干部在学习上得到了系统的指导，使学习得以逐步深入，在短期内获得了较大的效果。如开始学习时，我们了解到很多干部过去没有读过“联共（布）党史”，对苏联和苏联共产党的历史晓得很少，因而在学习中感到摸不清头绪。我们组织了三位讲师分别概括地介绍了第九章以前各章的主要内容，使干部找到了来龙去脉，对第九章的学习有很大的好处。在第九章学习中，讲师又分题进行了详细的讲解，诱导与启发干部更好地领会主文，并按理论联系实际的方法更深刻地认识苏联的经济建设经验和我国经济建设中的若干重大问题，在一定程度上解决了干部在学习中“钻不进”、“消化不了”和
  “系统不起来”等困难。在举办初级组理论教员讲座中，讲师团也起到了很重要的作用。参加讲座的学员包括了省、市机关的初级组理论教员和省级机关的全部初级组学习辅导员共一千一百多人，他们都是初级组学习的指导者和骨干；但大多是理论水平不够高，备课时间也不充分。有了讲师在讲座讲课，就使他们在教学与辅导前有机会先学一步；特别是讲师在讲课中明确指出了每章的教学要点和要求，提供了教学范例，使初级组理论教员、辅导员的教学与辅导水平大为提高，因而也大大推动了全体初级组干部的学习。
    为了作好讲师团工作，我们采取了下面几个办法：
    第一、在党委的号召与支持下，充分发挥讲师的积极性。省委对讲师团的工作是很重视的，经常加以督促。讲师每讲一课，给以适当的酬金，以资鼓励。省委书记周小舟同志不但动员其他讲师积极讲课，而且亲自带头多次给干部讲课。讲师团的成员虽都是领导干部，工作繁忙，但多数都很重视自己的任务，讲课、备课积极认真。例如省委秘书长杨第甫同志，有时备课到深夜，在讲解“联共
  （布）党史”第九章第一、二节时，认真阅读了列宁斯大林的有关著作，反复钻研，找出理论根据，重点深入，使干部对文件精神的领会得到更深的启示，并适当联系中国革命的实际情况及党在当前的方针政策，使干部普遍感到讲课内容丰富、系统，讲解通俗、生动。讲师的积极性的发挥，使教学质量不断得到提高。
    第二、领导干部学习的部门对讲师多方进行具体的帮助。省委宣传部、省直属党委宣传部和中级组业余政治学校教务处对这方面是比较注意的。在讲师讲课之前，派人去多次联系，或具体地帮助讲师备课。在这方面主要做了这几件事：（一）及早确定讲课的题目和时间，通知讲师，使他们有所准备；（二）向讲师事先提出对于讲授的要求，从而提高其讲授效果；（三）充分提供参考资料；（四）搜集干部在学习中的思想情况和疑难问题，提供讲师参考，使他们能在讲课时“有的放矢”。
    第三、集体研究和认真审阅讲师的讲授提纲。这是保证教学质量的重要关键。中级组业余政治学校的讲师，多是省级机关高级组中心小组的组员，因此，他们在讲课前，一般都在中心小组讨论时
  （中心组比一般高级组和中级组都先学一步），提出自己的讲授提纲，并当作小组的中心发言，然后由大家进行讨论，或补充、或修正。这样，不但有助于中心组的学习，同时也是对讲师的讲授提纲进行了集体的研究与审查，既便利易行，又能收到很好的效果。“联共（布）党史”第九章学习以来的经验证明，这个办法是值得今后继续采用的。其次，初级组理论教员讲座的讲师在讲课前，拟出讲授提纲，交省委宣传部审查；在讲课后，参考学员反映，及时修正印发。
    为了把讲师团的工作做得更好，我们今后应该注意下面几个问题：
    第一、过去，讲师团人虽不少，但被请讲课的老是少数几个已被证明为学员喜爱的讲师。学习“联共（布）党史”以来讲课的只九人，圈子太小，搞得这几个人忙不过来。今后，除应适当调整讲师团的组织外，并应注意扩大讲课人的圈子。
    第二、进一步把省级机关高级组中心小组的学习搞好，健全其学习制度，坚持比一般高级组先学一步。讲师团的骨干都在中心组，中心组的学习搞得好，讲师的教学水平就会提高。讲师对中级组讲课前，务必把讲授提纲提交中心组讨论，不是中心组组员的讲师，可在其讲课前，邀请他到中心组提出自己的讲授提纲给大家讨论，或者请他参加听讲。
    第三、领导干部学习的部门，还应进一步加强对讲师的具体帮助。特别是省委宣传部，应有专人来做这件事。
    第四、过去，领导干部学习的部门，很少在教学方法方面帮助讲师。今后，这些部门应该注意总结和推广讲师的好的教学经验，并可在一定时期召开讲师座谈会，交流经验；此外，还应经常搜集学员对讲师的教学方法的意见，提供讲师参考改进。
    第五、过去，由于领导干部学习的部门管理得不够好，讲师团的工作显得时紧时松，计划不周密，有的讲师临时推托，有时就影响了整个教学计划，今后必须加以改进，使讲师团的工作能更加经常地有计划地进行。
