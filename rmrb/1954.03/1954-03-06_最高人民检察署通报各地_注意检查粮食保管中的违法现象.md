The Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government issued a notice to all local People's Procuratorates on February 19th, urging them to pay attention to inspecting major illegal problems in grain storage work. It also suggested that relevant agencies take effective measures to eliminate and prevent such illegal phenomena and report and prosecute individuals whose actions constitute criminal behavior, thereby ensuring the safety of state property from the perspective of procuratorial work. The notice forwarded the inspection report of the Hubei Provincial People's Procuratorate on the mold and spoilage of soybeans in Hanchuan County, Hubei Province. The report stated: Hanchuan County is rich in soybeans, and the purchase results are also significant. However, due to poor planning by the leadership, insufficient understanding of the situation, and a lack of appropriate arrangements, the quality (dryness and wetness) was not carefully checked during the purchase process, and dry and wet soybeans were not stored separately after being received. In addition, processing plants and relevant units disregarded overall interests and failed to actively and conscientiously cooperate, resulting in the soybean mold and spoilage incident. For example, when soybeans collected in the Ninth District, Liuge Town, were found to be heating and moldy and were to be transported to Makou Town for processing, five private oil mills refused to process them, and the state-owned "Lianqun" oil mill also stood idly by. Despite repeated negotiations by the cooperative and warehouse负责人, they still refused to process the beans. When a large amount of heating and mold was discovered in the soybeans, there were plans to borrow the playground of the Makou Middle School in the province for sun-drying, but the Makou Middle School refused, citing the importance of physical education.

    After receiving the news of soybean mold and spoilage in Hanchuan County, the Hubei Provincial People's Procuratorate immediately sent people to the county for a focused inspection and found that more than 260,000 jin of soybeans had rotted in the ninth and tenth districts. Among them, 700 jin were completely rotten and could only be sold to the masses at a low price as fertilizer. Although most of the rest could be used to make oil cakes after being leached, the color of the cakes was not good, and the masses were unwilling to order them, nor were the cooperatives willing to take them. Currently, there are more than 3 million jin of processed cakes stored in Makou Town, and the oil mill is so full that there is no room to walk. There has also been no timely transfer of the inventory. According to warehouse comrades, it will not be possible to store these cakes until the third month of the lunar calendar. Because the moldy beans produce 2.5 jin less oil per 100 jin than good beans, the loss, including processing fees, amounts to 32.23 million yuan. Secondly, because the soybeans purchased had high moisture content, the weight was lost during sun-drying. Combined with the theft by individual boatmen, the whereabouts of 40,000 jin of soybeans are unknown (excluding transportation losses as stipulated). Calculating at an average value of 960 yuan per jin of soybeans, the loss is 38.4 million yuan. In addition, the purchase of soybeans with high moisture content increased the unnecessary costs of sun-drying, handling, and ship detention fees, amounting to approximately 38.0846 million yuan. The total loss of the above items amounts to 108.7146 million yuan.

    Although the Hanchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had noticed the problem when the soybeans began to mold and had sent people to inspect and made arrangements for grain storage at the district committee secretary meeting, it did not implement these arrangements well, so it did not arouse the necessary attention of lower-level cadres. After inspecting the soybean mold and spoilage incident, the Hubei Provincial People's Procuratorate made suggestions to the county committee on strengthening grain storage work. It also put forward the following points: 1. The leadership organs of all localities should learn from the lessons of the soybean mold and spoilage incident in Hanchuan County, put grain storage work on the agenda of the leadership, and actively seek effective measures to prevent grain mold and spoilage. This is a very urgent task at present. 2. The urgent problems to be solved in grain storage work at present are: strengthening leadership; solving the problem of cadre strength in grain storage; organizing cadres with certain capabilities to conduct inspections and supervision, improve the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of storage personnel, and help them come up with ideas and methods. In addition, some equipment problems need to be solved. 3. The state-owned "Lianqun" oil mill in Makou Town consistently refused to process the soybeans after several consultations with comrades from the county. The Makou Middle School refused to lend its playground, even after the county head personally made a telegram request. The relevant leading organs should order them to conduct a review to correct the erroneous ideological style of disregarding the overall interests of the country and not cherishing state property. The county's industrial and commercial leading organs should also criticize and educate the mistakes of the five private oil mills.

    Now the Hanchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has made a special study of this issue, established a grain storage committee, formulated the necessary grain storage system, and called on the county's party members and cadres to pay attention to grain storage work.

### 最高人民检察署通报各地  注意检查粮食保管中的违法现象

    最高人民检察署通报各地
    注意检查粮食保管中的违法现象
    中央人民政府最高人民检察署二月十九日通报各地人民检察署注意检查粮食保管工作中的重大违法问题；并建议有关机关采取有效措施消除与防止此类违法现象，对已经构成犯罪行为的分子予以检举起诉，从检察工作方面确保国家财富的安全。通报转发了湖北省人民检察署关于该省汉川县黄豆霉烂情况的检查报告。报告说：汉川县盛产黄豆，收购成绩也很大。但由于领导上计划不周，情况掌握不够，缺乏适当的安排，在收购时就未能认真按照质量（干湿）验收，收进后又未将干湿黄豆分开入仓保管。加上各加工厂及有关单位不顾整体利益，未能积极认真协同配合，结果就发生了黄豆霉烂事件。如九区刘隔镇所收黄豆因发热发霉而调运马口镇加工时，五户私商油厂竟拒绝加工，而国营“联群”油厂也袖手旁观，虽经合作社与仓库负责人几度交涉，仍拒不加工。在发现黄豆大量发热发霉时，拟借省立马口中学操场翻晒，但马口中学竟借口体育重要而不答应。
    湖北省人民检察署在得到汉川县发生黄豆霉烂的消息后，立即派人前往该县作了重点检查，发现九、十两区共霉烂黄豆二十六万多斤。其中除有七百斤完全烂掉，只好以贱价售与群众做肥料外，其他大部分虽能渗好豆打饼出油，但饼色不好，群众不大愿意订购，合作社也不愿意要。马口镇现存加工饼三百多万斤，油厂塞得没路走，也没有及时外调。据仓库同志谈已不能存至夏历三月。因霉烂了的豆比一般好豆每百斤少出二斤半油，如加上加工费，光这项损失即达三千二百二十三万元。其次，因为收购时水分多，翻晒掉秤，加上个别船户的偷盗，已有四万斤黄豆没有了着落（途中耗费按规定除外）。以每斤黄豆平均值九百六十元计算，即损失三千八百四十万元。此外，因收购了水分较多的黄豆而增加了不应有的翻晒、搬运力资和船只延期费，此项损失约为三千八百零八万四千六百元。以上各项共计损失一亿零八百七十一万四千六百元。
    中共汉川县委在黄豆开始发生霉烂时虽已注意，并曾派人检查，又在区委书记会议上对粮食保管作了布置，但因没有很好的坚持贯彻，所以也没有引起下面干部应有的注意。湖北省人民检察署在检查了黄豆霉烂事件后，对县委提出了关于加强粮食保管工作的建议。并提出了以下几点意见：一、各地领导机关应接受汉川县黄豆霉烂事件的教训，把粮食保管工作提到领导的议事日程上来，并积极设法采取有效措施防止粮食的霉烂，这在目前是一件十分迫切的任务。二、目前在粮食保管工作上急需解决的问题是：加强领导；解决保管粮食的干部力量问题；组织具有一定能力的干部进行巡视检查和督促，提高保管人员的责任心和积极性，并帮助想些办法，出些主意。此外还需要解决一些设备方面的问题。三、马口镇国营“联群”榨油厂经县的同志几次商谈，始终拒绝加工；马口中学拒绝借用操场，甚至县长亲自电商，仍不肯借用，均应由各有关领导机关责令检讨，借以纠正不顾国家整体利益和不爱惜国家财产的错误思想作风。对五家私营油厂的错误亦应由该县工商领导机关给以批评教育。
    现在中共汉川县委对这问题已经作了专门研究，成立了粮食保管委员会，制订了粮食保管的必要制度，并号召该县党员、干部重视粮食保管工作。
