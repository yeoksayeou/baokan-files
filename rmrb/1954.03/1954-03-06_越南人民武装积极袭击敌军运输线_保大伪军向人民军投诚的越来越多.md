Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, closely coordinating with operations on other fronts, successfully attacked enemy transport convoys on roads and railways in various locations during February, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces conducted seven operations on the railway connecting Saigon and Loc Ninh, 100 kilometers north of Saigon, and on Highway 13, destroying two enemy heavy trucks, one locomotive, and two train cars, eliminating 115 enemy soldiers. On Highway 14 in South Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces destroyed one enemy truck in a battle, eliminating 15 enemy soldiers. The Vietnamese People's Armed Forces also intercepted two enemy military trains on the railway connecting Saigon and Phan Thiet and on Highway 1, completely annihilating two enemy platoons. A cart full of gasoline and fifteen carts full of oil were hit by the People's Armed Forces and burned.

On Highway 12 in central Vietnam, the People's Armed Forces conducted five operations, destroying six trucks and eliminating over 100 enemy soldiers, including a French military district commander.

Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, influenced by the continuous victories of the Vietnamese People's Army, more and more Bao Dai puppet troops are surrendering to the Vietnamese People's Army. In the past two months, in Phu Vinh County, Thua Thien Province, central Vietnam alone, 200 Bao Dai puppet troops have surrendered to the Vietnamese People's Army. Recently, in Quang Tri Province, central Vietnam, another 120 Bao Dai puppet troops surrendered to the People's Army.

Desertion is also widespread among the Bao Dai puppet troops. In Soc Trang Province, South Vietnam, for example, in Su Wen County, 113 puppet troops who had been forcibly conscripted deserted and returned home in the first week of January. In the Phu Nu area of Ke Sach County, 396 out of 400 young people recently forcibly conscripted by the enemy have escaped from the French military strongholds.

    保大伪军向人民军投诚的越来越多
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民武装密切配合其他战线作战，在二月间顺利地在各处公路和铁路上袭击敌人的运输队，使敌人遭受很大损失。
    越南人民武装在连接西贡和西贡以北一百公里禄宁的铁路和第十三号公路上，共作战七次，击毁敌军重型卡车二辆、机车一辆和车厢二节，歼敌一百一十五名。在南越第十四号公路上，人民武装在一次战斗中击毁敌军卡车一辆，歼敌十五名。越南人民武装并在连接西贡和藩切的铁路和第一号公路上，截击敌人军用列车二列，计全歼敌军两个排。并有一辆满载汽油的马车和十五辆满载石油的马车被人民武装击中，着火焚毁。
    在越南中部第十二号公路上，人民武装作战五次，击毁卡车六辆，歼敌一百多名，其中包括法军军分区指挥官一名。
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社讯：在越南人民军接连取得胜利的影响下，保大伪军向越南人民军投诚的越来越多。在过去两个月中，仅在中越承天省富荣县就有二百名保大伪军投向越南人民军。最近，在中越广治省，又有一百二十名保大伪军投向人民军。
    保大伪军中开小差的现象也很普遍。以南越朔庄省为例，在素文县，在一月份的第一个星期中就有一百十三名被强征入伍的伪军逃回家去。在计察县府努地区，在四百名最近被敌人强征来的青年中，已有三百九十六人逃出了法军据点。
