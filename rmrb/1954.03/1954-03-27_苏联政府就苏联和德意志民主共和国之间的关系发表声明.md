Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th (TASS): Soviet newspapers on March 26th published a statement by the Soviet government regarding relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    "The Soviet government has always been committed to promoting a solution to the German question in accordance with the interests of strengthening peace and ensuring the reunification of Germany on a democratic basis.

    To achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to take practical measures to bring East and West Germany closer together, hold free all-German elections, and conclude a peace treaty with Germany.

    Despite the efforts of the Soviet Union, no steps were taken at the recent Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference to restore German unity and conclude a peace treaty.

    In view of this situation, and based on the results of talks between the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government believes that it is now necessary to take new steps to meet the interests of the German people, before Germany is unified and a peace treaty is concluded. These steps are:

    (1) The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic establish relations like those with other sovereign states.

    The German Democratic Republic will be able to decide its domestic and foreign affairs according to its own will, including relations with West Germany.

    (2) The Soviet Union retains the responsibility for ensuring security within the German Democratic Republic, as undertaken under the Four Power Agreements.

    The Soviet government notes the statement by the government of the German Democratic Republic that it will fulfill the obligations given to the German Democratic Republic under the Potsdam Agreement that Germany should develop into a democratic and peace-loving country, as well as the obligation to allow Soviet troops to be temporarily stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

    (3) The supervision previously exercised by the Soviet High Commissioner in Germany over the activities of the state organs of the German Democratic Republic will be abolished.

    Accordingly, the powers of the Soviet High Commissioner in Germany will be limited to issues related to the aforementioned security guarantees, and to maintaining appropriate contact with the representatives of the American, British, and French occupying authorities on issues of an all-German nature, in accordance with the unanimous agreements reached by the four powers on the German question.

    The Soviet government believes that the "occupation statute" implemented by the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany not only violates the principles of democracy and the national rights of the German people, but also, in the current situation, is one of the main obstacles to the restoration of German national unity, as it hinders the rapprochement between West and East Germany."

    苏联政府就苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系发表声明
   【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电：三月二十六日，苏联报纸刊登了苏联政府就苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的关系发表的一篇声明：声明全文如下：
    “苏联政府一向致力于按照加强和平和保证在民主的基础上重新统一德国的利益，促使德国问题得到解决。
    为了达到上述目标，必须采取使东西德更加接近的实际措施，举行全德自由选举和缔结对德和约。
    虽然苏联作了努力，但在不久前的柏林四国外长会议上，还是没有采取任何步骤来恢复德国的统一和缔结和约。
    鉴于这种情况，并根据苏联政府与德意志民主共和国政府会谈的结果，苏联政府认为，现在，在德国还没有统一，和约还没有缔结以前，已经有必要采取新的步骤来满足德国人民的利益，这些步骤是：
    （一）苏联与德意志民主共和国建立像与其他主权国家一样的关系。
    德意志民主共和国将能按照它自己的意志，自行决定它的国内和对外事务，包括与西德的关系在内。
    （二）苏联保留在德意志民主共和国内行使根据四国协定所承担的保障安全的职责。
    苏联政府注意到德意志民主共和国政府这样的声明：它将履行波茨坦协定中关于德国应该发展成为一个民主与爱好和平的国家这一规定所给予德意志民主共和国的义务，以及履行让苏联军队暂时驻扎在德意志民主共和国领土上的义务。
    （三）苏联驻德高级专员至今一直对德意志民主共和国国家机关的活动所进行的监督，将予以取消。
    据此，苏联驻德高级专员的职权将只限于有关上述保障安全的问题以及根据四国关于德国问题所取得的一致协议，就全德性质的问题与美、英、法三国占领当局的代表保持相应的联系。
    苏联政府认为：美国、英国与法国在西德实行的“占领法规”不仅违反民主的原则和德国人民的民族权利，而且在目前情况下，由于阻碍西德和东德的接近，也是德国国家恢复统一的主要障碍之一。”
