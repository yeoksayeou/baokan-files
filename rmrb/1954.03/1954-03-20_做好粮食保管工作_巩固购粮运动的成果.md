Do a good job in grain storage
Consolidate the achievements of the grain purchase campaign
Under the education and encouragement of the general line, farmers across the country sold an unprecedented amount of surplus grain to the state after the autumn harvest last year. This has given the state more grain in its possession this year than in any previous year, providing a reliable guarantee for the grain supply. This is a great victory in grain work. At the same time, however, it has also increased the task of grain storage. The grain produced through the hard work of the vast number of farmers and collected and purchased through the arduous efforts of millions of cadres, if we do not store it well and losses such as mold and insect pests occur, it will not only directly weaken the state's material strength but also damage the results of the grain collection and purchase campaign. Therefore, doing a good job in grain storage is of great economic significance as well as great political significance.

Over the past four years, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, with the support of the people, and with the efforts of all grain work cadres and the cooperation of relevant departments, we have achieved many successes in grain storage work. We have added some warehouses, established a set of grain storage and warehouse protection systems, and accumulated some experience, basically ensuring the safe storage of grain. In 1952, the loss in national grain storage accounted for only 0.124 percent of all grain, a significant decrease compared with the past. Grain storage cadres, like other types of custodians, worked tirelessly and actively, and made many exemplary achievements. The pest-free grain depot that appeared in Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province, is an example. Although the grain depot in Yu Hang County was only an ordinary civilian house with very poor equipment, thanks to the noble qualities of the warehouse staff in cherishing the property of the people and the motherland, a high sense of responsibility for grain storage, and the result of contacting the masses, working actively, and practicing what they preached, 55 of the 80 grain depots in the county completely eliminated various insect pests last year. Before the grain was put into storage, they attached importance to disinfecting the empty warehouses and mobilizing the masses to do a good job in preventing and controlling grain diseases and insect pests. After the grain was put into storage, they often paid attention to inspection, cleaning, and disinfection and insecticidal work, and so on. Therefore, they finally achieved remarkable results and became a banner for grain storage work. All storage workers across the country should learn from the storage workers in Yu Hang County in order to further improve our grain storage work.

Strengthening grain storage work is of particular importance this year. First of all, because the amount of grain put into storage this year has greatly increased compared with previous years, and the time for putting it into storage was very short. About 42 percent of the total amount put into storage for the whole year was concentrated in warehouses within two months, which made the quality inspection of the grain put into storage less thorough and strict than in previous years. In addition, the southern regions had long periods of rain during the storage period, so the quality of the grain put into storage, with the exception of the public grain collected, which generally met the standards, was generally high in moisture and contained many impurities. The moisture content of grain purchased throughout the country generally exceeded the safe standard, with moisture content mostly ranging from 16 to 20 percent. Secondly, due to the large amount of grain put into storage, the insufficient warehouse capacity, and the need to facilitate farmers to deliver grain to the warehouse, a large number of grain collection points have been added. As a result, grain storage this year is extremely decentralized, and there are even fewer storage cadres. If we do not find ways to improve storage methods and appropriately allocate storage forces, it will be difficult to store this grain well. In particular, as the spring season approaches, the rainy season will also follow, which is the time when stored grain is most likely to change. At present, there have already been incidents of heat generation, deterioration, mold, and insect pests in the stored grain. In addition, some areas have also discovered special agents and counter-revolutionaries taking the opportunity to carry out sabotage. All of these situations have brought great difficulties to future grain storage work. Although there are the above-mentioned unfavorable conditions and objective difficulties in grain storage, we also have many favorable conditions. First of all, we have four years of grain storage experience, which is of great use for the safe storage of grain in the future. Secondly, all the vast number of grain storage cadres, under the education and encouragement of the general line, will be able to further develop their wisdom. Combined with their highly responsible and dedicated hard work, they will certainly create more exemplary deeds. In particular, with the assistance of the broad masses and the strong leadership of local Party and government organizations, as long as we give full play to the strength of all parties, we are fully confident that grain storage work can be done well. Therefore, local Party committees and governments must attach great importance to grain storage work and launch a grain inspection and protection campaign in the grain departments as soon as possible to ensure the safe storage of grain.

In order to do a good job in grain storage, it is necessary to strengthen scientific and technical guidance and establish and improve the warehousing and storage system. To this end, we must first do a good job in the investigation and research of grain, warehouses, and personnel. That is, we must carefully study and understand the different conditions, different varieties, and qualities of the grain stored in the warehouse; we must carefully study and understand the different types and different properties of the warehouse, so that we have a clear understanding of the conditions of all the stored grain and the conditions of all the warehouse capacity. Only in this way can we plan to treat, sort out, ventilate, and dry the grain that may deteriorate currently, according to the degree of severity and urgency, and take effective preventive measures and properly store the remaining grain; can we clarify the quantity of different varieties and grades of grain stored in each warehouse, check grain accounts, establish and improve the account table system of the warehouse, and do a good job in grain statistics on this basis; can we find out the capacity of various warehouses and the distribution of warehouse capacity, clarify the utilization of warehouses and the equipment, and facilitate further mastery of the distribution of warehouse capacity and the repair of warehouses according to the law of grain circulation; can we plan to train, promote, and examine storage workers according to the current situation of personnel, adjust the backbone, and allocate storage forces.

Secondly, to do a good job in grain warehousing and storage, we should regard doing a good job in regular cleaning and sanitation and inspection as the most fundamental method. When grain has already suffered from diseases and insect pests, although drug prevention and control is important, it is a last resort. The "prevention is better than cure" that we often talk about is to be realized through regular cleaning and sanitation. The example of pest-free warehouses in Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province, fully proves this. As for mastering the safety of stored grain, we must rely on a simple and feasible scientific inspection and forecasting system for grain quality (moisture, grain temperature, impurities, and disease and pest conditions). Once a change in stored grain is detected, we should use existing equipment such as windmills and sieves (manual machinery) to sort out the grain, and use sunlight to expose the grain with skin. The grain stored in the vast townships can rely on and organize the masses of farmers to sort out and dry it. As long as the inspection work and sorting work are done well, a lot of losses can be avoided. In the past practical work, there was a wrong understanding of simply relying on post-event drug chemical prevention and control. Of course, it is possible to carry out some drug disinfection of empty warehouses in possible and necessary warehouses, but if we do not pay attention to inspection and sorting work in peacetime, and only use drugs to kill insect pests when the grain insect pests are extremely serious, it will be too late. This not only increases the expenditure of funds, but also increases the loss of grain.

Again, it is also necessary to strengthen the security work of grain warehouses. Recently, due to lack of precautions in some places, there have been serious accidents such as warehouse fires and thefts, which have caused certain losses to the country and the people. We must be highly vigilant about this, strengthen the grain protection organization, and strictly prevent the sabotage activities of special agents and counter-revolutionaries. We must establish a warehouse safety and security system and add necessary safety equipment to ensure the safety of grain warehouses.

Grain storage work is an arduous and glorious task. All grain workers, especially grain storage workers, must deeply understand the important significance of grain storage work, be at ease in their work, study their business, improve storage technology, and closely rely on the masses to be responsible for doing a good job in grain storage. In particular, we should learn from the work experience of warehouse staff in Yu Hang County and other model warehouse staff, and strive to create more pest-free grain warehouses across the country. At present, a large part of the grain in grassroots warehouses is kept by cooperatives. Therefore, grain departments and cooperatives at all levels must strengthen contacts, divide responsibilities and cooperate, strengthen business guidance to grassroots cooperatives, and jointly store grain well. Party and government leading organs at all levels should lead and check the grain departments to do their best in grain storage work, and educate and mobilize the masses to care for and assist grain storage work. Grain leading organs and relevant departments at all levels should, under the local Party and government leadership, go deep into the warehouses, take the lead at all levels, and extensively carry out the warehousing inspection work of grain. They should also strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the warehousing staff, care about their lives, commend model examples, promote the revolutionary spirit of actively working hard, and criticize the wrong ideas of those who despise storage work and are not at ease in grain work. Mobilize all grain cadres to work hard for the safe storage of grain and to further improve grain storage work.

    做好粮食保管工作
    巩固购粮运动的成果
    全国各地农民在总路线的教育和鼓舞下，去年秋收后向国家出售余粮的数量空前增加，这就使国家今年掌握的粮食，比以往任何一年都多，使粮食供应有了可靠的保证。这是粮食工作中的一个巨大胜利。但与此同时，也加重了粮食保管的任务。经过广大农民辛勤劳动的生产、经过千百万干部艰苦努力的征收和收购来的粮食，如果我们保管不好，发生霉烂与虫害等损失的现象，那就不仅会直接削弱国家的物资力量，也会损害征粮购粮运动的成果。所以，做好粮食保管工作，不但具有重大的经济意义，也具有重大的政治意义。
    四年来，在各地党和政府领导下，在人民群众的支持下，在全体粮食工作干部的努力和有关部门的配合下，我们在粮食保管工作方面，曾经取得了不少的成绩，增添了一些仓房、建立了一套粮食保管制度和护仓制度、积累了一些经验，基本上保证了粮食的安全储存。一九五二年，全国粮食保管中的损失，只占全部粮食的百分之零点一二四，比过去有很大的降低；粮食保管工作干部，也像其他方面的保管工作干部一样，不辞劳苦、积极苦干，做出了很多的模范事迹。浙江余杭县出现的无虫粮仓，就是例子。余杭县的粮食仓库，虽然只是普通的民房，各项设备很差，但是由于该县仓库工作人员具有爱护人民祖国财产的高贵品质，对粮食保管工作的高度责任感以及联系群众、积极苦干、身体力行的结果，在全县八十个粮仓中，去年就有五十五个粮仓完全消除了各种虫害。他们在粮食入仓前，重视空仓消毒工作和发动群众做好粮食病虫害的防治工作；在粮食入库后，经常注意检查、清扫和消毒杀虫工作等等。因此他们终于获得了显著的成绩，成为粮食保管工作的旗帜。全国保管工作人员，都应向余杭县保管工作人员学习，以便进一步提高我们的粮食保管工作。
    加强粮食保管工作，在今年更有其特殊重要性。首先，由于今年入库的粮食数量比往年大有增加，入库时间又很短促，约占全年全部入库数量百分之四十二的粮食，是在两个月内集中涌入仓库的，这就使得入库粮食的质量检验工作，没有往年那样周密和严格。加之南方地区在入库期间久雨不晴，因此入库粮食的质量，除征收的公粮一般尚合乎标准外，收购的粮食，一般情况则是水分大、杂质多。全国各地收购粮食的水分，大部超过了安全标准，含水分多在百分之十六至百分之二十。其次，由于入仓粮食的数量大、仓容不足，和为了便于农民送粮入库的关系，大批增设了收粮点，因而今年粮食的储存极度分散，保管干部就更加不足，如果不设法改善保管工作方法和适当调配保管工作力量，就很难保管好这些粮食。特别是现在时届春暖季节，梅雨季节也将随之而来，这是存粮最易发生变化的时候。且目前存粮就已有发热、变质、霉烂、虫害的事件发生。此外，有些地区还发现特务、反革命分子乘机破坏。以上这些情况，都给今后粮食保管工作带来极大的困难。在粮食保管方面，虽有上述不利条件和客观困难，但我们也有很多有利条件：首先我们有四年来的粮食保管经验，这些经验对今后粮食的安全储存是有很大作用的；其次，所有广大的粮食保管干部在总路线的教育和鼓舞下，必能进一步地发挥他们的智慧，结合他们埋头苦干的高度责任心，一定能创造出更多的模范事迹；特别是有广大群众的协助和当地党政的坚强领导，只要充分地发挥各方面的力量，我们完全相信粮食的保管工作是有条件做好的。因此，各地党政必须十分重视粮食的保管工作，及早在粮食部门开展一个查仓保粮运动，以保证粮食的安全储存。
    为了作好粮食保管工作，必须加强科学技术指导，建立和健全仓储保管制度。为此，首先要做好粮食、仓库和人员的调查研究工作。这就是要很好研究和了解仓库中存粮的不同情况、不同品种和质量；要很好研究和了解仓库的不同类型、不同性质，做到对全部存粮情况和全部仓容情况心中有数。只有这样，才能有计划地分别轻重缓急地对当前可能发生变质的粮食进行救治、整理、出风、翻晒，并对其余的粮食进行有效的预防措施、妥善保管；才能弄清每一个仓库所存的不同品种、等级的粮食数量，查清粮食账目，建立和健全仓廒的账表制度，并在这一基础上做好粮食统计工作；才能查清各种仓库容量和仓容分布情况，弄清仓库的利用程度和设备情况，便于根据粮食流转的规律，进一步掌握仓容的分布和仓库的修葺工作；才能根据现有人员状况有计划地培养、提拔和审查保管工作人员，调整骨干，配置保管力量。
    其次，要做好粮食仓储保管工作，应以做好经常的清洁卫生工作和检查工作为最根本的办法。而当粮食已经发生病虫害的时候，药剂的防治虽然是重要的，但这是一个不得已的最后办法。我们常讲的“防重于治”，就是要通过经常的清洁卫生工作来实现的，浙江余杭县无虫仓的例子也充分证明了这一点。至于对仓存粮食安全情况的掌握，必须依靠对粮质（水分、粮温、杂质和病虫害情况）的简捷可行的科学检查测报制度，一当发现存粮有变化时，即应运用现有设备如风车、筛子（人力机械）等来整理粮食，以及利用阳光来曝晒带皮的粮食，分散在广大乡镇的存粮可以依靠和组织农民群众进行整理和翻晒。只要检查工作和整理工作作得好，就可以避免很多损失。在过去的实际工作中，曾经存在过单纯依赖事后的药剂化学防治的错误认识。当然，在有可能和必要的仓房进行一些空仓的药剂消毒是可以的，但是如果平时不注意检查整理工作，在粮食虫害已极严重时才去采用药剂杀除虫害，这就为时已晚了。这既增加经费的开支，又增加粮食的损耗。
    再次，还必须加强粮食仓库的保卫工作。近来有的地方，由于疏于防范，已发生了仓库失火、被盗等严重事故，给国家、人民带来了一定的损失。我们对此必须引起高度警惕，加强护粮组织、严防特务、反革命分子的破坏活动。要建立仓库安全保卫的制度，增添必要的安全的设备，使粮食仓库的安全有确切的保证。
    粮食保管工作是一项艰巨而又光荣的任务，全体粮食工作人员、特别是粮食保管工作人员，必须深切明白粮食保管工作的重要意义，安心工作，钻研业务，提高保管技术，而且紧密依靠群众，负责把粮食保管工作作好。特别应学习余杭县仓储工作人员和其它模范仓储工作人员的工作经验，为在全国创造更多的无虫粮仓而奋斗。目前基层仓库有很大一部分粮食是由合作社经手保管的，因此，各级粮食部门与合作社必须加强联系，分工合作，加强对基层合作社的业务指导，共同把粮食保管好。各级党政领导机关应该领导和检查粮食部门全力做好粮食保管工作，并教育和动员广大群众关心和协助粮食保管工作。各级粮食领导机关及有关部门，应该在当地党政领导下深入仓库、层层带动，广泛地开展粮食的仓储检查工作，并要加强仓储工作人员的政治思想领导，关心他们的生活；表扬模范事例，发扬积极苦干的革命精神；批判那些轻视保管工作、不安心粮食工作的错误思想。动员全体粮食干部为粮食的安全储存，为进一步做好粮食保管工作而努力。
