Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 23rd: TASS correspondent Riston reported from Washington in "The New York Times" that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff is discussing various proposals for the U.S. to intensify its intervention in the Indochina War.

Riston wrote: "The chiefs of staff are studying the following proposals with Secretary of State Dulles: 1. Immediately transport more light bombers to Indochina to help defend the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu… General Ely, Chief of Staff of the French Army, who is now in Washington, believes that sending another large squadron—twenty-five B-26 bombers—will help clear out the Communist artillery that is causing trouble for the French garrison. 2. Send more transport planes to replace those destroyed in recent battles. ...3. Strengthen the work of training Indochinese pilots at the U.S. base in the Philippines. It is understood that this plan has already begun to be implemented. 4. Study how to organize an international team of pilots, funded by the United States, to serve France and Vietnam (the Bao Dai puppet regime). The last point is to urge France to allow the United States to assist in training Vietnamese."

The negotiations currently underway in Washington between U.S. military leaders and General Ely, Chief of Staff of the French Army, have gone beyond these limits (the negotiations between Ely and U.S. government representatives in Washington began on the 22nd). For example, they also discussed under what circumstances the United States would directly intervene in the Indochina War. Officials here generally agree that, under the current circumstances, if possible, France should be given more assistance. The problem troubling the State Department and the Department of Defense is the issue of getting France to continue the war and planning a strategy to win.

    美国加紧策划进一步干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：据“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿报道，美国参谋长联席会议正在讨论美国加紧干涉印度支那战争的各种建议。
    赖斯顿写道：“参谋长们正在和国务卿杜勒斯一起研究下列各项建议：一，立刻以更多的轻型轰炸机运往印度支那，以便协助保卫法军要塞奠边府……现在在华盛顿的法军总参谋长埃利将军认为，再派一大队——二十五架B二十六型轰炸机去将有助于清除给法国守军带来麻烦的共军炮兵。二，再派一些运输机去，以代替在最近的战役中被击毁的飞机。……三，加强在菲律宾美国基地训练印度支那驾驶员的工作。据了解，这一计划已经开始实行。四，研究如何组织一个由美国出资维持的国际飞行员队，以替法国和越南（保大傀儡政权）服务。最后一点是促使法国允许美国协助训练越南人。”
    美国军事领袖和法军总参谋长埃利将军目前在华盛顿所进行的谈判已超出了这些范围（按埃利和美国政府代表在华盛顿的谈判是于二十二日开始的）。例如，他们还讨论了在什么情况下美国要直接干涉印度支那战争。此间官员普遍同意，在目前情况下，如果可能，应给予法国更多的帮助。使国务院和国防部感到麻烦的问题是使法国继续进行战争和策划出赢得胜利的战略的问题。
