Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 22nd: The Xiangjiang River Railway Bridge officially opened to traffic on March 21st. On the 20th, a grand opening ceremony was held in Xiangtan City. As the beautiful train crossed the light gray railway bridge spanning the Xiangjiang River and headed towards the brand-new Xiangtan Railway Station on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River, more than a thousand representatives of workers, students, residents, and suburban farmers from Xiangtan City stood on both sides of the railway and cheered. After the Xiangjiang River Bridge opened to traffic, trains can travel directly from the Zhuzhou-Xiangtan branch line of the Yuehan Railway to the emerging industrial city of Xiangtan. Goods on both sides of the Xiangjiang River no longer need to be transported by wooden sailing boats. The abundant agricultural products and minerals on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River can be transported out in large quantities. A large number of industrial products can also be transported more conveniently to cities and villages on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River.

　　This railway bridge is one of the largest railway bridges in southern China. From the start of construction in August last year to its completion at the end of January this year, the entire project took only six months. The steel used for the bridge and the modern bridge-building tools were all made in China. Before the opening, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government organized an acceptance committee to conduct a detailed inspection, and concluded that the quality of the bridge fully meets the standards.

    湘江大铁桥通车
   【新华社长沙二十二日电】湘江大铁桥已在三月二十一日正式通车，二十日湘潭市举行了隆重的通车典礼。当漂亮的列车穿过横跨湘江的浅灰色大铁桥，向着湘江西岸簇新的湘潭车站驰近时，湘潭市一千多工人、学生、居民和郊区农民的代表，站在铁路两旁夹道欢呼。湘江大桥通车后，火车能从粤汉铁路的株洲—湘潭支线直达新兴的工业城市湘潭市区。湘江两岸的货物从此可以不再用木帆船驳运。湘江西岸的丰富的农产品和矿产可以大量运出。大批工业品也能更方便地运到湘江西岸的城市和乡村中去。
    这座铁桥是我国南方最大的铁桥之一。从去年八月动工到今年一月底完工，全部工程只用了六个月时间。架桥所用的钢材和近代化的架桥工具全部是我国自制的。通车前，中央人民政府铁道部曾组织验收委员会详细地进行了检验，认为大桥的质量完全合乎标准。
