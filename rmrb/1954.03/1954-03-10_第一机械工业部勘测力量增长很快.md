To ensure the completion of surveying and mapping tasks for projects designed with Soviet assistance and key domestic projects, the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building began preparing to establish surveying and mapping organizations in the second quarter of 1953. It also held surveying and mapping meetings to study and determine the guiding principles and tasks of surveying and mapping work, in conjunction with the design progress of the projects in the country's first Five-Year Plan. It was decided to strengthen the surveying and mapping force to provide accurate basic design data in a timely manner. Over the past six months, the surveying and mapping strength of the First Ministry of Machine Building has grown significantly. Currently, there are eight surveying and mapping teams and seven soil testing laboratories, distributed in East China, North China, Northeast China, Central South China and other places, engaged in soil analysis work. Another laboratory is under construction. Various important equipment, such as theodolites, levels, permeameters, and drilling machines, have been fully replenished according to plan. The total number of employees in the surveying and mapping teams and soil testing laboratories has increased by 133 percent compared to six months ago. The investment of these main equipment and human resources into the country's construction cause has begun and will continue to play a significant role in providing the basic design data needed for the first Five-Year Plan. Starting from the third quarter of 1953, surveying and mapping work was carried out in North China, Northeast China, Central South China, and Northwest China in a more planned way for projects designed with Soviet assistance. As the specific requirements of the design progress increased, the surveying and mapping work gradually entered a tense stage from the fourth quarter. In order to focus on solving the surveying and mapping work of Soviet-designed projects, the Design Bureau also convened the second surveying and mapping conference in November of last year. Based on the existing personnel, equipment, and technical conditions, the surveying and mapping tasks were deployed in a planned, focused, and phased manner. Emphasis was placed on improving technical levels and strengthening political and ideological education, so that surveying and mapping technicians at all levels could politically recognize the importance of surveying and mapping work. In order to carefully review the correctness and authenticity of the surveying and mapping results, the Design Bureau effectively carried out technical inspection work with the active assistance of Soviet experts, and promptly corrected the tendency to neglect quality. Thanks to the close cooperation of all links, the surveying and mapping tasks of key design factories in 1954 were basically completed.

Currently, the Design Bureau of the ministry is holding training classes for surveying and mapping personnel to improve the technical level of surveying and mapping personnel and unify operating methods, so as to better complete the heavy surveying and mapping tasks.

    第一机械工业部勘测力量增长很快
    中央第一机械工业部设计总局为保证完成苏联帮助我国设计的工程项目和国内重点工程的勘测任务，于一九五三年第二季度开始筹建勘测机构，并举行勘测会议，结合国家第一个五年计划工程项目的设计进度，研究和确定了勘测工作的方针和任务，并决定加强勘测力量，以便能及时地提供正确的设计基础资料。近半年来，第一机械工业部的勘测力量已有了显著的增长，目前已有了八个勘测队，七个土工试验室，正分布在华东、华北、东北、中南等地从事土壤分析工作，尚有一个室正在筹建中。各种重要设备如经纬仪、水准仪、渗压机、钻探机等，均已按照计划补充齐全。各勘测队和土工试验室的职工总人数，已较半年前增加了百分之一三三，这些主要设备和人力投入了祖国建设事业，对提供第一个五年计划所需要的设计基础资料，已开始并将继续起到它的重大作用。从一九五三年第三季度起，更有计划地分别在华北、东北、中南、和西北等地对苏联帮助设计项目进行了勘测工作。随着设计进度的具体要求，勘测工作由第四季度起已逐步转入紧张阶段。设计总局为了重点解决苏联设计项目的勘测工作，又于去年十一月间召集第二次勘测会议，根据现有人员、设备和技术条件，有计划、有重点、分阶段的部署了勘测任务。并强调提高技术水平，加强政治思想教育，使各级勘测技术人员从政治上认识到勘测工作的重要性。设计总局为认真审查勘测成果的正确性和真实性，在苏联专家的积极帮助下，有效地开展了技术检查工作，及时地纠正了忽视质量的倾向。由于各个环节的密切配合，基本上完成了一九五四年重点设计厂的勘测任务。
    目前，该部设计总局正在举办勘测人员训练班，以提高勘测人员的技术水平，统一操作方法，以便更好地完成繁重的勘测任务。
