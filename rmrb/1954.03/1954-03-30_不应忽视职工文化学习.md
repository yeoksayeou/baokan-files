Reader's Letters Summary:

    Employee Cultural Learning Should Not Be Ignored
    Han Xizheng of the Shenyang Refractory Material Factory writes: The leadership of our factory does not pay much attention to the spare-time cultural learning of employees, which has prevented the development of employee cultural learning for a long time and affected the improvement of employees' cultural level.
    In 1953, the trade union opened six cultural classes (including two quick literacy classes). However, when the central task came, the leadership stopped the employees' spare-time cultural learning. Thus, learning would stop for a few days and then start again for a few days, the learning effect was not significant, and the number of students decreased day by day. For example, the sixth-grade class one originally had more than 20 students, but later only one person remained, and the same was true in other classes. As a result, all six classes were suspended indefinitely after more than a month. The trade union watched this situation without checking the reasons or trying to improve it.
    At the beginning of this year, the training section of the Shenyang Municipal Labor Bureau sent people to our factory to help formulate the 1954 employee training plan. The Party branch, personnel section, and trade union comrades of our factory held a meeting in January and decided to draft separately and unify into one plan. However, the chairman of the trade union and the cultural and educational committee member did not care about it, and the draft plan has not yet been produced. When someone went to the trade union to inquire, a full-time teacher replied: "The work in the factory is too busy, there is no time to learn culture."
    The employees of our factory are eager to learn culture. More than 30 employees went to spare-time schools organized by the street because there was no place to learn in the factory. It is hoped that the trade union and administrative leaders of our factory will pay attention to the demands of the employees, earnestly implement the Central Committee's instructions on developing employee spare-time education, and actively promote employee cultural learning.

### 不应忽视职工文化学习

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不应忽视职工文化学习
    沈阳市耐火材料厂韩希正来信：我厂领导方面对职工的业余文化学习不很重视，使职工文化学习长期得不到开展，影响了职工文化水平的提高。
    一九五三年工会开办了六个文化班（内有二个速成识字班）。但中心工作一来，领导方面就把职工业余文化学习停了。这样学几天停几天，学习效果不大，学员一天比一天减少。如六年级一班原有二十多个学员，后来就只剩了一个人，其他班上也是如此，于是一个多月后，六个班都长期停课了。工会眼看着这种情况也不检查原因、设法改进。
    今年年初，沈阳市劳动局培训科派人来我厂帮助制订一九五四年职工培养计划。我厂党支部、人事科与工会等同志在一月份召开了会议，确定分别起草、统一归纳成一个计划。但工会主席和文教委员都不闻不问，计划草案直到现在还未搞出来。有人到工会去查问时，有一个专职教师回答说：“厂内工作太忙，那有时间学文化。”
    我厂职工们是迫切要求学习文化的，有三十多个职工因为本厂无处学习就自己到街道组织的业余学校去读书。希望我厂工会和行政领导方面，重视职工的要求，认真贯彻中央关于开展职工业余教育的指示，积极把职工的文化学习搞起来。
