Report on the Basic Situation and Future Tasks of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Report by President Guo Moruo to the 204th Meeting of the Government Administration Council on January 28, 1954, and approved by the same meeting)

I

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the scientific research work in China, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and through the efforts of all scientific workers, has created certain conditions for scientific research to serve national construction in a planned manner and for the further development of China's scientific undertakings. For the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is now also possible to start from the existing foundation and, according to the requirements of the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, put forward the guiding principles and tasks for future work.

Most of the research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were established on the basis of the original Academia Sinica, Peiping Academy of Sciences, and other scientific institutions. Before 1952, the Academy mainly carried out the work of uniting scientists and adjusting institutions, so that the past situation of overlapping institutions, scattered manpower, and ideological confusion was improved. In 1952, it accepted the Northeast Science Institute and its Dalian Branch, which were transferred by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, and formed the Northeast Branch together with other research institutions that moved from Shanghai and Beijing to the Northeast, strengthening the Academy's technical science strength. With the victory of the revolutionary cause in all aspects, especially the victory of various social reform movements and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and with the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production, China's scientific cause has also undergone fundamental changes. The scientific research institutions, which were used as decorations by the reactionary Kuomintang regime in the past, have been transformed into a part of the people's cause. The vast majority of scientists have participated in the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries," "Three-Anti," the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and ideological remolding study movements, and enthusiastically responded to the call to learn from the advanced science of the Soviet Union; some scientists have participated in social reform movements such as the "Land Reform" and "Five-Anti," and also participated in natural resource surveys, accompanying troops into Tibet, and opposing bacteriological warfare, thus greatly improving their political consciousness. In the scientific research work itself, some valuable scientific research topics have also been completed.

According to statistics at the end of September 1953, the Academy of Sciences had a total of 36 scientific research institutions (25 research institutes, 4 independent research offices, 4 preparatory offices of research institutes, and the Observatory, Instrument Museum, and Microbial Strain Preservation Committee), including 15 in Beijing, 13 in East China, and 8 in the Northeast. The whole academy has a total of 1,725 professional scientific researchers, including 347 senior researchers above the associate researcher level. In the past four years, the main achievements in scientific research have been as follows: (1) In terms of national natural condition survey and resource exploration: cooperating with the Ministry of Geology to carry out large-scale geological surveys and explorations, expanding certain mining areas, and increasing the estimated reserves of mineral deposits, such as the iron ore in Inner Mongolia and Daye, the coal mines in the Northeast and Northwest, and the non-ferrous metal mines in Gansu have new discoveries; cooperating with the Meteorological Bureau to improve short-term weather forecasts, improve accuracy, and start medium-term weather forecasts, which have played a considerable role in national defense and farmland water conservancy; and also jointly with agriculture, forestry and other departments carried out surveys of plants, soil and fish. (2) In terms of supporting industrial and agricultural production: the successful trial production of nodular cast iron provides a new metal material with low cost and good performance for the machinery industry; the synthesis of synthetic rubber has results, and the research is continuing to improve its quality; the successful extraction and trial production of toluene is conducive to solving the problem of the production of important raw materials for the national defense industry; the trial production of pulp and various special drugs has a certain effect on the related industrial production; the methods of weeding and aphid control have been promoted in the main cotton-growing areas of North China; the separation and selection of soybean rhizobia and the prevention and treatment of fish diseases have contributed to the increase of agricultural and aquatic product yields. (3) In terms of basic theoretical research in natural science: in physics research, some work has been carried out in nuclear physics and other aspects; in mathematics research, the theory of additive prime numbers has been revised and published; in chemistry research, the stereochemistry of the structure of citrinin has been solved; in biology research, the results of the experiment on mixed semen hybridization of silkworms have provided new arguments for the Mitchurin theory of genetics. (4) In the field of social sciences: certain achievements have been made in the study of history and language, in the collection and collation of economic data, and in archaeological excavations. In addition, in 1951, with the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a Tibetan work team was organized to work in Tibet. In the past two years, a preliminary understanding of the natural conditions and resources of the Tibetan region has been gained, and deposits of iron, non-ferrous metals, petroleum, gypsum, and other minerals have been discovered. Contributions have also been made in assisting local soldiers and civilians to improve agricultural production. In the struggle against bacteriological warfare, scientific workers inside and outside the Academy have played an active role.

Compared with the current needs of the country, the above-mentioned work achievements are obviously far from enough. The level of science in old China was not high, and there are still many shortcomings in the work of the Academy of Sciences, and the existing potential power of the Academy has not yet been fully utilized.

II

The main problems existing in the Academy of Sciences at present are the following:

(1) The issue of further understanding China's existing scientific foundation and strength. The scientific foundation of old China was weak, the development was unbalanced, and the number of people was very small. The development in the four years after liberation is still far behind the requirements of national construction. As far as the Academy of Sciences itself is concerned, except for some research units with relatively strong strength and relatively complete lineup, most units are not sound enough. Some important links in certain scientific departments are either very weak or have no foundation at all. For example, in botany, there are very few people studying plant ecology and geobotany; in zoology, there are no experts studying mammals; the foundations in genetics and microbiology are very poor. In chemistry, inorganic chemistry and analytical chemistry, which are closely related to heavy industry, are weak. In geophysics, there are very few experts on earthquakes, which is far from meeting the needs of current basic construction. In terms of technical sciences, except for the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics, which has a certain foundation, the rest were newly established during the period of industrial recovery in the Northeast. Therefore, judging from the level of science in China, the Academy of Sciences has concentrated a group of scientific talents with a relatively high level, but according to the requirements of the current national construction tasks, our current foundation and strength are obviously not competent. The scientific research forces outside the Academy are mostly distributed in various industrial departments and universities, and there is a lack of regular contact with each other, so they have not been fully and rationally used. In order to appropriately organize scientific research forces on the existing basis so that they can play the most effective role in national construction, it is first necessary to strengthen investigation and research, further comprehensively understand China's existing scientific foundation and strength, and formulate a practical and feasible work plan and development plan based on this. This is the primary and most fundamental problem in the current work of the Academy of Sciences. (2) The issue of training scientific cadres and strengthening the work of uniting scientists. Actively training scientific cadres is a basic link in scientific development. Without the continuous growth of new forces, the scientific cause will stagnate. Because there are many categories of science and the requirements of each are different, it is by no means possible to train scientific cadres with independent research capabilities overnight. The Academy of Sciences lacked a serious plan for training scientific cadres in the past, and only stayed at the level of general calls, without a certain system and regular leadership. Except for a few research units where the leadership attaches great importance and has achieved certain results, the general situation is very poor, and not much experience has been accumulated. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify ideologically throughout the Academy that training cadres is a long-term central task of the Academy of Sciences, and to formulate practical and feasible systems and methods based on the current actual situation and combined with the Soviet experience. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the work of uniting scientists. Only by giving play to the enthusiasm of existing scientists and continuously improving their scientific and ideological level can we do a good job in research work and train the younger generation. At present, many veteran scientists attach great importance to the work of training cadres, and young people can also learn from veteran scientists with an open mind. However, there are still some uncoordinated phenomena between some young people and veteran scientists. Young people often have excessive and urgent demands on veteran scientists, or one-sidedly emphasize the practical application value of science and personal development prospects. Therefore, it is necessary to educate young people to respect veteran scientists and learn from veteran scientists in a serious manner, so that they can give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity in scientific research business and be willing to pass on their knowledge and experience to the next generation. It is necessary to provide veteran scientists with certain living and working conditions, and material or spiritual rewards must be given for their inventions and creations, and their knowledge labor results must be respected. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen ideological work in various research institutes so that the work of uniting scientists and the training of scientific cadres can be unified and correctly realized. (3) The issue of specifically implementing the policy of combining theory with practice. The policy that theory must be combined with practice and that science must serve national construction is sincerely supported by the vast majority of scientists and has begun to be practiced in their work. However, because the Academy of Sciences lacks serious research on how to specifically implement the policy of combining theory with practice and has not carried out the necessary work, it knew very little about the country's economic plans in the past, and the connection with industrial departments was not done well enough, so some practical difficulties and ideological confusion arose in the specific implementation of various research institutes. On the one hand, in some young scientific workers, there is a tendency to simplify the combination of theory and practice. They often understand "practice" as purely direct production tasks. On the other hand, some people are divorced from reality and one-sidedly emphasize that research institutes of the Academy of Sciences must study profound theoretical problems, and even believe that solving the current production problems cannot be regarded as scientific work. This is mainly the result of unclear and inconsistent ideological understanding, and the inability to start from the specific situation of the research institute and generally raise questions. In the future, it is necessary to specifically stipulate the research direction and business focus of each institute in conjunction with the work of formulating research plans to implement the policy of combining theory with practice. At the same time, the Academy of Sciences should strengthen its ties with industrial departments in the future to promote creative cooperation between scientific research and production and construction. This is an important link in solving the problem of combining theory with practice. (4) Issues related to organizational leadership. The Academy of Sciences is an academic research institution, which is different in nature from general organs. Therefore, the Academy of Sciences must proceed from the characteristics of the Academy of Sciences in terms of organizational structure and leadership methods, so as to correctly and effectively lead national scientific activities, first of all, to lead the scientific research work of the research institutes under its jurisdiction. At present, the leadership structure and leadership methods of the Academy of Sciences are not much different from those of other government departments. First of all, it has failed to appropriately organize outstanding domestic scientists to participate in academic leadership work, which is a decisive issue for strengthening the academic leadership of the Academy of Sciences and making the Academy of Sciences a national scientific research center in name and in fact. In terms of leadership methods, it has failed to grasp the characteristics of scientific business, and the work is generally general. It has only recently become clear that all work of the Academy of Sciences must be carried out around scientific business. Some necessary academic activities, such as holding scientific conferences, organizing academic discussions, and solving production and academic problems, have not been carried out seriously. The academic reward system has not yet been effectively established. Because the research units under the Academy of Sciences are scattered in various places, there is little specific leadership other than general instructions. Within the research institute, there is a lack of leadership backbone, and the directors of various institutes are too busy with administrative affairs, some almost completely divorced from research business, and the phenomenon of busyness and disconnection between the upper and lower levels is equally serious in their work. Therefore, the current organizational structure of the Academy of Sciences must be appropriately adjusted, the leadership backbone must be appropriately strengthened, and the leadership methods must be completely changed, otherwise, it will be impossible to develop China's scientific cause on the existing basis, and thus it will be impossible to complete its glorious responsibilities in the great cause of China's socialist industrialization.

III

China's first five-year economic construction plan has been fully launched with the assistance of the great ally, the Soviet Union. The current guiding principles and tasks of scientific work should be to follow the general line of the country during the transition period, seriously learn from the experience of the Soviet Union's advanced scientific work, actively support national construction, give full play to the high enthusiasm and creativity of scientists, and strive to develop our scientific cause and enrich our scientific team in practice, so as to resolutely realize the country's general line and general tasks of construction. Without the continuous support of science and technology and the corresponding development of scientific undertakings, it is impossible to complete the task of national socialist industrialization; conversely, it is equally impossible to achieve the goal of developing scientific undertakings without scientific practice that actively supports national construction.

In accordance with the above spirit, the main tasks of the Academy of Sciences at present are proposed as follows:

(1) On the existing basis, appropriately organize the scientific forces that can be used at present and fully support national industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction. In terms of technical science, the various institutes should focus on solving problems in mining, metallurgy, coal, petroleum, mechanical power, and civil engineering construction, and establish close contacts with industrial departments. According to the existing manpower, equipment, and business level, solve the problems raised in the current industrial construction and national defense construction in a realistic manner. Strive to make more and greater contributions in connecting with reality, summarizing the specific experience of engineering and technical personnel and the broad masses of workers, and in the continuous improvement of scientific business level.

(2) Conduct investigation and research on underground and above-ground resources and natural conditions in industrial centers or economic regions that are under construction or are about to be constructed in a focused manner, and put forward specific suggestions or reference materials for the rational utilization of national resources to relevant departments. This is not only urgently needed for national construction, but also necessary for the development of geoscience and biological science itself. Old Chinese data is scarce, and we must conduct thorough investigation and research on China's nature, society, and history, and enrich, develop, and improve China's scientific cause on the basis of possessing a large amount of materials. In particular, planned investigation and research work must be carried out for the development of agriculture, aquatic products, forestry, and animal husbandry.

(3) Correspondingly develop basic science, so as to become a powerful guarantee for continuously supporting national construction and continuously improving scientific levels. The various institutes of basic science should focus on improving and training cadres, and at the same time, according to the needs of national construction, put forward key scientific problems and seriously study them, so as to actively prepare conditions for striving to comprehensively solve major scientific problems raised in national construction. It is planned to gradually concentrate the forces of basic sciences such as physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, and geology in Beijing, cooperate with relevant universities, and systematically train scientific talents who can continue to study in depth, so as to lay a foundation for the further and comprehensive development of China's scientific cause.

(4) For sciences that are urgently needed in production or academically, but are still very weak or have no foundation at all today, conditions should be prepared immediately and ways should be found to enrich and establish them. Cadres should be trained in relevant research institutes in a planned and targeted manner, majors should be set up in domestic universities, and graduate students should be selected to study in the Soviet Union and other brother countries, so that our scientific team, which is still not sound enough today, can be gradually supplemented. China's experience in agriculture and medicine is the most abundant, but it has not been valued by many of our scientists until today, so advocating the study and summarization of scientific experience among the broad masses of people should also become one of the important tasks for the development of China's scientific cause at present.

(5) Find ways to strengthen the forces in the social sciences. At present, there are four research institutes in the social sciences, including economics, language, archeology, and modern history, and two research institutes on ancient history and medieval history are being prepared. Research on other aspects such as philosophy, international issues, and Asian history is also urgently needed to be started. We plan to concentrate talents, enrich existing research institutes, and gradually establish new research institutes, carry out research work on the basis of improving the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, and organize various scientific discussions in a planned and guided manner to gradually solve the current existing academic disputes related to history, theory, and practice.

(6) Continue to unite existing scientists, actively train new forces, and expand the team and reserve forces of scientific work. Organize the study of the advanced scientific theories and methods of the Soviet Union in a planned and guided manner, encourage the study of the basic theories and classic works of Marxism-Leninism, improve the academic and ideological level of scientists, and regard the training of young scientific cadres as the most central task of all scientific work at present.

In order to realize the above tasks, the following improved work methods are proposed:

(1) In conjunction with the formulation of the 1954 research plan, rectify and improve the work of various research institutes in a focused and practical manner. The research institute is the grass-roots organization of the Academy of Sciences' work. The formulation of research plans, the specific guidance of academic research, the conduct of ideological and political work, and the improvement and training of scientific cadres cannot be carried out without going through the research institute. When formulating the research plans of various institutes, it is necessary to consider how to specifically implement the policy of combining theory with practice from the nature and development conditions of each discipline. For example, technical science and some biological sciences can be directly combined with production practice, while some basic sciences can only be indirectly combined with production practice. Some research can immediately serve production construction directly or indirectly with conditions, and some research still needs to prepare conditions before results can be obtained after several years. These specific conditions must be combined with the work of formulating plans, and fully discussed by scientists to achieve a consensus in understanding. Correct the conservative and unrealistic deviations in the past work, so that the 1954 research plan can be formulated more practically.

(2) Specifically organize the work of learning from the Soviet Union and training cadres. At the institute director's meeting held in October 1953, discussions were held on the above work. It was generally believed that learning from the advanced scientific theories and methods of the Soviet Union, investigation and research, and summarizing mass experience are the basic links for improving China's scientific level, and vigorously training cadres is the long-term central task of China's scientific work, and it was requested that these be specifically stipulated in the work plan. In the past, the Academy of Sciences lagged behind in learning from the Soviet Union to a greater extent. After the return of the visiting Soviet delegation, the situation has changed, but it is still in a state of no plan. In the future, emphasis should be placed on planned learning, not only learning from the advanced scientific theories of the Soviet Union, but also learning their working methods, spirit, and attitude. In particular, learn from their glorious examples of achieving great achievements by making the best of simple equipment and overcoming difficulties in the anti-fascist war of defense. We suggest that the Soviet Academy of Sciences be invited to send a delegation to China in 1954 to conduct an inspection, so that Soviet scientists can specifically discuss how to realize the creative cooperation between the scientific work of the two countries in the future on the basis of further understanding the current situation of science in China. In addition, consolidate Russian language learning, continue to check the use of existing books and periodicals in various institutes, and organize the translation and publication of scientific translations and scientific abstracts in a focused manner, so that scientific workers who have not yet been able to directly read the original works can read the latest scientific works in a timely manner. Regularly organize report meetings or discussion meetings on various scientific works, and write the contents of the discussion or learning experience into papers for publication.

In terms of training cadres, a graduate student office should be added to be responsible for guiding the training of graduate students throughout the Academy. First, organize a special committee to discuss and draft graduate student regulations and academic reward measures, and strive to enroll the first batch of graduate students in the third quarter of 1954, and start the work of training scientific cadres in a planned manner. Training plans should also be formulated for research trainees. The research institutions under the Academy of Sciences are distributed in various places. Generally speaking, physics, mathematics, chemistry, geoscience, and social sciences will be concentrated in Beijing; soil and astronomy will mainly be in Nanjing; physiology and biochemistry will mainly be in Shanghai; and technical sciences will mainly be in the Northeast. Due to historical conditions and the limitations of housing equipment, major changes are impossible in the recent years. Therefore, it is hoped that the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government can consider the above-mentioned regional distribution in setting up majors in universities, so that senior researchers of the Academy of Sciences can teach part-time in universities, and university teachers can also more conveniently do scientific work part-time, and concentrate efforts to jointly train scientific research talents for the country.

(3) In order to ensure the smooth completion of scientific work tasks and make scientific work effectively serve national construction, the following measures are proposed to be taken to improve the leadership structure and leadership methods:

1. It is recommended that a special agency be established within the State Planning Commission to be responsible for comprehensively reviewing scientific research plans, so that various scientific research institutions can eliminate the past phenomenon of mutual separation, duplication of work, and waste of manpower and equipment, and organically connect and coordinate the overall requirements of the country with the forces of scientific research institutions in various aspects.

2. The various research institutes of technical science under the Academy of Sciences should establish close contacts with relevant industrial departments and other departments to implement regular creative cooperation. The proposal of the work tasks and the formulation of the research plan of each institute shall be jointly reviewed by the Academy of Sciences and various institutes and the relevant industrial ministries, and the regular business and administrative leadership shall still be responsible by the Academy of Sciences. In this way, the relations between the two sides can be fully opened up, the potential strength can be fully utilized, and technical scientific research can be combined with national industrial construction, avoiding the phenomenon that research work is divorced from national needs, or that the country has assigned too many tasks and the research institutes cannot weigh the priorities.

3. Strengthen the leadership of the Academy of Sciences. A secretariat should be established under the Council of the Academy to select a number of scientists to serve as secretaries, becoming a powerful assistant to the Council of the Academy in academic leadership. The Academy is led by the branches to the various institutes, and it is planned to temporarily divide them into four branches: the Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry Branch, the Technical Science Branch, the Biological and Earth Science Branch, and the Social Science Branch; each branch is organized by the directors of the institutes under its jurisdiction and relevant experts inside and outside the Academy. A branch committee (the organizational regulations of the branch committee will be formulated separately); the branch committee is only responsible for academic leadership and not for administrative affairs. A personnel bureau should be added to strengthen the management and training of scientific cadres; a translation and publishing committee should be added to be responsible for leading and specifically planning the translation and publishing work of the entire Academy.

4. Improve the leadership of the research institute. Each institute should establish an academic committee, which is composed of the director of the institute and relevant experts inside and outside the institute (the organizational regulations of the academic committee of the institute will be formulated separately); its task is to formulate research plans, lead academic discussion meetings, review scientific papers, and train graduate students. An administrative deputy director should be set up in the institute, and an administrative organization should be established to reduce the administrative burden of researchers and strengthen political and ideological leadership. All research institutes, offices, observatories, seismological stations, and workstations scattered in various places are uniformly led by the government where each unit is located in their daily political work, ideological education, and supervision of daily work.

5. Strengthen the leadership of the Northeast Branch and the East China Office over the various institutes in their locations. And prepare to set up the Preparatory Office of the Northwest Branch, the Preparatory Office of the Southwest Comprehensive Research Institute, and the South China Work Station in Xi'an, Kunming, and Guangzhou respectively, all of which are entrusted to the major administrative regions for management.

    关于中国科学院的基本情况和今后工作任务的报告（一九五四年一月二十八日郭沫若院长在政务院第二百零四次政务会议上的报告，并经同次会议批准）
    一
    中华人民共和国成立以来，中国的科学研究工作，在中央人民政府的领导下，经过全体科学工作者的努力，已经为科学研究有计划地服务于国家建设，为我国科学事业的进一步发展创造了一定的条件。对于中国科学院来说，今天也已经有可能从现有基础上出发，根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的要求，提出今后工作的方针和任务。
      中国科学院的大部分研究所是在原来中央研究院和北平研究院等科学机构的基础上建立起来的。一九五二年以前，科学院主要进行了团结科学家和调整机构的工作，使过去机构重叠、人力分散和思想混乱的情况，得到了改善。一九五二年接受了东北人民政府工业部所移交的东北科学研究所及其大连分所，并会同从上海、北京迁往东北的其他研究机构，组成东北分院，加强了科学院技术科学方面的力量。随着革命事业在各个方面的胜利，特别是各种社会改革运动和抗美援朝的胜利，随着工农业生产的恢复和发展，我国的科学事业同样也起了根本的变化。过去被反动的国民党政权当作装饰品的科学研究机构，已经转变为人民事业的一部分了。绝大多数的科学家都已经参加了“镇反”、“三反”、抗美援朝和思想改造学习运动，并热烈响应学习苏联先进科学的号召；部分科学家曾经参加“土改”、“五反”等社会改革运动，同时还参加了对自然资源调查、随军入藏和反对细菌战等工作，因而大大地提高了他们的政治觉悟。在科学研究工作本身，也完成了一些有价值的科学研究题目。
    一九五三年九月底的统计，科学院共有三十六个科学研究机构（二十五个研究所，四个独立的研究室，四个研究所的筹备处和天文台、仪器馆、菌种保藏委员会），其中十五个在北京，十三个在华东，八个在东北。全院共有一七二五个专业的科学研究人员，其中副研究员以上的高级研究人员三四七人。四年中，在科学研究方面主要有下面一些成绩：（一）在国家自然条件调查与资源勘察方面：配合地质部进行了大规模的地质调查与勘探工作，扩大了某些矿区，提高了矿藏的估计储量，如内蒙、大冶的铁矿，东北、西北的煤矿，甘肃的有色金属矿等都有新的发现；与气象局合作改进了短期天气预报、提高了准确度，并开始中期天气预报，对国防、农田水利起了相当大的作用；又会同农、林等部门进行了植物、土壤与鱼类的调查。（二）在配合工农业生产方面：球墨铸铁的试制成功，在机械工业上提供了成本低、性能好的新的金属材料；人造橡胶的合成已有结果，现在继续研究改进其品质；甲苯的提炼与试制的成功，有利于解决国防工业重要原料生产的问题；纸浆及各种特效药物的试制等，对有关的工业生产都有一定的作用；除草防蚜的办法，已在华北主要植棉区推广；大豆根瘤菌的分离与选择，鱼病的防治，对提高农业与水产产量方面都有所贡献。（三）在自然科学基本理论研究方面：物理学的研究上，在原子核物理方面及其他方面进行了一些工作；数学的研究上，修订出版了堆垒素数论；化学的研究上，解决了橘霉素结构的立体化学问题；生物学的研究上，关于家蚕混精杂交实验的结果给米邱林遗传学说提供了新的论证。（四）社会科学方面：在历史、语言的研究中，在经济资料的搜集整理和考古发掘中，都有一定的成绩。此外，一九五一年随着西藏的和平解放，组织了西藏工作队进藏工作，两年来对西藏地区自然条件与资源有了初步认识，并发现了铁、有色金属、石油、石膏等矿藏，在协助当地军民改进农业生产上也有所贡献。在反细菌战斗争中，院内外的科学工作者都曾经起了积极作用。
    上述工作成就与当前国家需要相比，显然是很不够的。旧中国科学水平不高，加以科学院工作中尚存在着许多缺点，科学院现有的潜在力量也还没有能充分发挥出来。二
    目前科学院存在的问题主要的有下列几个方面：
      （一）进一步了解中国现有科学基础和力量的问题。旧中国的科学基础薄弱，发展不平衡，人数甚少，解放后四年来的发展，仍远落后于国家建设的要求。就科学院本身讲，除部分研究单位力量比较强，阵容比较整齐外，多数单位都不够健全。某些科学部门中的一些重要环节，或则力量很弱或则全无基础。例如植物学方面，研究植物生态学和地植物学的人极少；动物学方面没有研究哺乳动物的专家；遗传学和微生物学方面的基础都很差。化学方面，与重工业密切关联的无机化学、分析化学力量很弱。地球物理学方面，关于地震的专家极少，远不能适应当前基本建设的需要。技术科学方面，除冶金陶瓷研究所有一定基础外，其余都是在东北工业恢复时期中才新建立起来的。因此，就我国科学水平看，科学院是集中了一批水平较高的科学人材，但按当前国家建设任务的要求来说，我们今天的基础和力量显然是不能胜任的。院外的科学研究力量，多分布在各产业部门与高等学校中，彼此缺乏经常的联系，因而也就未能充分地合理使用，为了在现有基础上适当地组织科学研究的力量，使之能最有效地在国家建设中发挥作用，首先就需要加强调查研究，进一步全面地了解我国现有科学基础和力量，并据以制订确实可行的工作计划与发展计划，这是目前科学院工作中首要的也是最根本的问题。（二）培养科学干部与加强团结科学家的工作问题。积极培养科学干部是科学发展的基本环节，没有新生力量的不断增长，科学事业将停滞不前。由于科学各部门的门类繁多，要求各异，要培养出具有独立研究能力的科学干部绝非一朝一夕所能奏效。科学院对培养科学干部的工作，过去缺少认真的计划，只停留在一般号召上，没有一定的制度和经常的领导。除少数研究单位领导上比较重视，收到一定的成绩外，一般都做得很差，没有积累多少经验。因此，必须在全院范围内使大家从思想上明确培养干部是科学院长期的中心任务，并从当前的实际情况出发，结合苏联经验，制订切实可行的制度与办法。与此同时，必须加强团结科学家的工作，只有发挥现有科学家的积极性，不断提高他们的科学水平与思想水平，才能做好研究工作和培养年轻一代的工作。目前有不少的老科学家对培养干部的工作很重视，青年人也能虚心向老科学家学习。但也有些青年人与老科学家之间还存在着某些不协调现象。青年人往往对老科学家要求过高过急，或者是片面强调科学的实际应用价值和个人发展前途。因此必须教育青年尊重老科学家，并认真地向老科学家学习，使他们在科学研究业务上发挥高度的积极性和创造性，并愿意把自己的知识和经验传授给下一代。必须给老科学家以一定的生活和工作条件，对于他们的发明和创造必须给以物质或精神奖励，尊重他们的知识劳动的成果。今后必须加强对各研究所的思想工作、使团结科学家的工作和科学干部的培养工作，能够统一地、正确地予以实现。（三）关于具体贯彻理论结合实际方针问题。理论必须与实际结合，科学要为国家建设服务的方针，是绝大多数的科学家所衷心赞成，并开始在工作中加以实践的。但由于科学院对于如何具体贯彻理论结合实际的方针，缺少认真的研究和进行必要的工作，过去对国家的经济计划了解很少，对产业部门联系做得也很不够，因此各研究所在具体执行中就产生了一些实际困难和思想上的混乱。一方面，在部分青年科学工作者中，滋长着把理论联系实际简单化的倾向，他们往往把“实际”理解为纯粹的直接的生产任务。另一方面，也有一些人脱离了实际情况，片面强调科学院研究所必须研究高深理论问题，甚至认为解决目前生产上的问题不能算是科学工作。这主要是思想认识上的不明确、不一致，以及不能从研究所的具体情况出发，一般地提问题的结果。今后必须结合制订研究计划的工作，具体地规定各所的研究方向和业务重点，来贯彻理论结合实际的方针。同时，科学院今后应加强与产业部门的联系，促进科学研究与生产建设的创造性合作，这是解决理论联系实际问题的一个重要环节。（四）关于组织领导方面的问题。科学院是学术研究机构，它和一般机关在性质上有所不同。因此科学院在组织机构上、在领导方法上就必须从科学院的特点出发，做到能够正确地、有效地领导全国科学活动，首先是领导好本院所属各研究所的科学研究工作。目前科学院的领导机构和领导方法与政府其他部门没有多大的区别。首先，未能适当地组织国内优秀的科学家参加学术领导工作，而这对于加强科学院的学术领导，使科学院成为名符其实的全国科学研究的中心是具有决定意义的问题。在领导方法上未能抓住科学业务的特点，工作一般化。科学院各项工作必须围绕科学业务进行，这一点也是最近才明确起来。一些必要的学术活动如召开科学会议、组织学术讨论，解决生产和学术上的问题，都没有认真进行。学术上的奖励制度也还没有切实建立。由于科学院所属各研究单位散处各地，除一般指示外，很少具体的领导。在研究所内领导骨干缺乏，各所所长又多忙于行政事务，有的几乎等于全部脱离研究业务，工作中忙乱与上下脱节现象同样严重。因此，目前科学院的组织机构必须适当调整，领导骨干必须适当加强，领导方法必须彻底改变，否则就无法在现有基础上把我国的科学事业发展起来，因而也就无法在我国社会主义工业化的伟大事业中完成其光荣的职责。
  三我国第一个五年经济建设计划，已在伟大盟邦苏联的援助下全面开始。当前科学工作的方针任务，应该是遵循国家在过渡时期的总路线，认真学习苏联先进科学工作的经验，积极支援国家建设，发挥科学家的高度积极性和创造性，在实践中发展我们的科学事业，充实我们的科学队伍，为坚决实现国家建设的总路线和总任务而努力。没有科学技术的不断支援和科学事业的相应发展，要完成国家的社会主义工业化的任务是不可能的；反之，离开了积极支援国家建设的科学实践，要达到发展科学事业的目的也同样是不可能的。
    根据以上精神，提出科学院当前的主要工作任务如下：
    （一）在现有基础上把目前可以使用的科学力量适当组织起来，全力支援国家工业建设，首先是重工业建设。技术科学方面，各所应以解决矿冶、煤炭、石油、机械动力和土木建筑等方面的问题为主，并与工业部门取得密切联系，按照现有人力、设备和业务水平，实事求是地解决当前工业建设和国防建设中所提出的问题。争取在联系实际、总结工程技术人员和广大工人群众的具体经验中，在科学业务水平的不断提高中，作出更多更大的贡献。
    （二）有重点地对正在建设或即将建设的工业中心或经济区域，进行地下地上资源和自然条件的调查研究，向有关部门提出合理利用国家资源的具体建议或参考资料。这不仅为国家建设所迫切需要，同时也是地学和生物科学本身的发展所必需。我国旧有资料贫乏，我们必须对我国的自然、社会和历史进行周密的调查研究，在大量占有材料的基础上充实、发展与提高我国的科学事业。特别是对于农业、水产、林业以及畜牧业等方面的发展，都要进行有计划的调查研究工作。
      （三）相应地发展基础科学，使之成为不断支援国家建设和不断提高科学水平的有力保证。基础科学各所应以提高和培养干部为重点，同时根据国家建设的需要，提出具有关键性的科学问题，并认真地加以研究，为争取能够综合解决国家建设中所提出的重大科学问题积极准备条件。计划将物理、数学、化学、生物、地质等基础科学力量逐步集中北京，与有关的高等学校合作，有计划地培养可以继续深造的科学人材，为我国科学事业的进一步全面发展打下基础。
      （四）关于在生产上或学术上迫切需要，而今天依然十分薄弱或根本没有基础的科学，应立即准备条件，设法充实与建立起来。有计划有目标地在有关研究所中培养干部，在国内高等学校中设置专业，并选送研究生到苏联及其他兄弟国家学习，使我们今天还不够健全的科学队伍逐渐得到补充。我国农业和医学上的经验最为丰富，但直到今天还没有被我们的许多科学家所重视，所以提倡研究和总结广大人民群众中的科学经验，亦应成为目前发展我国科学事业的重要任务之一。
    （五）设法加强社会科学方面的力量。目前社会科学方面已有经济、语言、考古、近代史等四个研究所，正在筹备中的有关于上古史、中古史研究的两个研究所。其他如哲学、国际问题和亚洲史的研究也亟待开始。我们拟分别集中人材，充实已有的研究所，逐步建立新的研究所，在提高马克思、列宁主义理论水平的基础上，开展研究工作，并有计划有领导地组织各种科学讨论，以逐步解决目前存在着的有关历史的、理论的和实际的学术争论问题。
    （六）继续团结现有科学家，积极培养新生力量，扩大科学工作的队伍与后备力量。有计划有领导地组织对苏联先进科学理论及方法的学习，鼓励对马克思、列宁主义基本理论及经典著作的学习，提高科学家的学术水平和思想水平，并把培养青年科学干部作为目前全部科学工作的最中心的任务。
    为了实现上述任务，提出如下的改进工作办法：
    （一）结合制订一九五四年研究计划，有重点地切实整顿与改进各研究所的工作。研究所是科学院工作的基层组织，研究计划的制订，学术研究的具体指导，思想政治工作的进行，科学干部的提高和培养，都非经过研究所不可。在制订各所研究计划时，必须从各该门学科的性质和发展条件出发，考虑如何具体贯彻理论结合实际的方针。如技术科学和部分生物科学是可以直接结合生产实际的，而某些基础科学则只能间接地结合生产实际，有的研究是有条件立即直接或间接为生产建设服务，有的研究就还需要准备条件在若干年之后才能获得成果。必须将这些具体条件与制订计划的工作相结合，经过科学家充分的酝酿讨论，以求得认识上的一致。纠正过去工作中的保守的和不切合实际的偏向，使一九五四年的研究计划能够制订得更加切合实际。
      （二）具体组织关于学习苏联和培养干部的工作。在一九五三年十月召开的所长会议上，曾就以上工作提出讨论，共同认为学习苏联先进科学的理论及方法、调查研究和总结群众经验，是提高我国科学水平的基本环节，大力培养干部是我国科学工作的长期的中心任务，并要求把这些都具体规定到工作计划中去。过去科学院学习苏联较大学为落后，在访苏代表团归来以后，情况已有所转变，然仍处于无计划状态中。今后应强调有计划的学习，不仅学习苏联先进科学理论，而且要学习他们工作的方法、精神和态度。特别是学习他们在反法西斯卫国战争中，那种因陋就简、克服困难而取得巨大成就的光辉范例。我们建议在一九五四年内邀请苏联科学院派一个代表团来我国考察，使苏联科学家在进一步了解我国科学现状的基础上，具体商谈有关今后如何实现两国科学工作的创造性合作问题。此外，巩固俄文学习，继续检查各所对现有书刊的使用情况，有重点地组织翻译并出版科学译报和科学文摘，使尚未能直接阅读原著的科学工作者，可以及时读到最新的科学论著。定期组织有关各种科学论著的报告会或讨论会，并将讨论内容或学习心得写成论文发表。
    在培养干部方面，增设研究生处，负责指导全院研究生的培养工作。先组织专门委员会讨论并拟订研究生条例和学术奖励办法，争取在一九五四年第三季度内招收第一期研究生，开始有计划地培养科学干部的工作，对研究实习员也应制订培养的计划。科学院所属研究机构分布各地，大体说来，物理、数学、化学、地学和社会科学将集中于北京；土壤、天文主要在南京；生理、生化主要在上海；技术科学主要在东北。由于历史条件及房屋设备的限制，最近若干年内不可能有大的变动，因此希望中央高等教育部在高等学校中开设专业上能考虑到上述地区分布情况，以便科学院的高级研究人员能在大学兼课，大学教师也能更便利地兼做科学工作，集中力量共同为国家培养科学研究人材。
    （三）为保证科学工作任务的顺利完成，使科学工作有效地为国家建设服务，在改善领导机构和领导方法上拟请采取如下的措施：
    1、建议在国家计划委员会内成立专门机构，负责综合审查科学研究计划，以便各科学研究机关消除过去彼此隔阂、工作重复和人力、设备浪费的现象，使国家总的要求和各个方面的科学研究机构的力量有机地密切联系和配合起来。
    2、科学院所属技术科学的各研究所，与有关工业部门和其他部门取得密切联系，实行经常的创造性合作。各所工作任务的提出，研究计划的制订，均由科学院及各研究所与相关的工业部共同审核，经常业务与行政领导则仍由科学院负责。这样就可以把双方关系全面地打通，充分发挥潜在力量，使技术科学研究与国家工业建设相结合，避免研究工作脱离国家需要，或国家交下任务过多而各研究所又无法权衡轻重的现象。
    3、加强科学院的领导。在院务会议下成立秘书处，遴选科学家若干人充任秘书，成为院务会议在学术领导方面的有力助手。院对各研究所分学部领导，拟暂分为物理学数学化学部、技术科学部、生物学地学部、社会科学部等四个学部；各个学部由所属各所所长及院内外有关专家组织学部委员会
  （学部委员会组织条例另行规定）；学部委员会只管学术领导，不管行政事务。另增设人事局，加强对科学干部的管理和培养工作；增设编译出版委员会，负责领导并具体规划全院的编译出版工作。
    4、改进研究所的领导。各所设立学术委员会，由本所所长及所内外有关专家组成（所的学术委员会组织条例另行规定）；其任务为制订研究计划，领导学术讨论会，审查科学论文及培养研究生。所设行政副所长，建立行政机构，减轻研究人员的行政负担，加强政治思想领导。所有分散在各地的研究所、室及天文台、地震台和工作站，其日常的政治工作、思想教育及日常工作的监督，均由各该单位所在地的政府统一领导进行。
    5、加强东北分院、华东办事处对所在地各所的领导。并准备在西安、昆明及广州设立西北分院筹备处、西南综合研究所筹备处及华南工作站，均分别委托各大行政区代管。
