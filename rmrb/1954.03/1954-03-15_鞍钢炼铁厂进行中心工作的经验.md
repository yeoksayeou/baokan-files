Experiences of Anshan Iron and Steel Works in Carrying Out Central Tasks
Anshan Iron and Steel Works Director Cai Bo

Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel Works carried out two central tasks: one was the implementation of planned management, and the other was the implementation of the responsibility system. We conducted the central task of implementing planned management as a campaign for more than two months. The purpose of this campaign was to widely strengthen the education of planned concepts, establish the idea that "the national plan is the law," improve work plans, organize rhythmic and coordinated production, improve the planned management of various tasks to ensure the comprehensive realization of the national plan, and strengthen the unity of all employees and cadres to promote the consistency of political thought.

Through the campaign centered on implementing planned management, the entire plant formulated an advanced plan to comprehensively overfulfill the task. The cooperation and connection between various production departments were strengthened through work plans, especially the implementation of regular equipment maintenance and upkeep, and the normal supply of raw materials, which improved the rhythm of production. The responsibilities of each section for the national plan were clarified, and the role of each section was brought into play, thereby strengthening the planned management of all aspects of the entire national plan, establishing a management system for labor training plans, implementing a fixed-quota material distribution and technical measure management system, and improving original records. On the basis of completing the unified national plan, the ideological and political unity between workers, staff, technicians, and cadres was strengthened, and the level of mass consciousness was improved.

We carried out the campaign centered on implementing the responsibility system for nearly three months. According to the actual situation of our plant, we determined that the purpose of this central task was to implement and promote the production area management system, consolidate planned management from an organizational point of view, and improve the foundation of the responsibility system and strict work rules. The steps of the campaign were from top to bottom, solving problems layer by layer: first starting with each section, then proceeding among the cadres of the production and equipment systems, then penetrating into the worker groups, and finally conducting a comprehensive inspection from the perspective of business responsibility system. This allows the campaign to develop steadily and minimize the impact on production work as much as possible.

Through the campaign centered on implementing the responsibility system, the reform of the plant's management organization was completed according to the principle of production area management system, clarifying the organization of the four work sections of raw materials, mechanical maintenance, electrical maintenance, and repair shop, and further clarifying the responsibilities of functional institutions and personnel. Planned management was strengthened. On the one hand, the division of labor between functional institutions and personnel was thoroughly clarified. On the other hand, the comprehensive responsibility system for personnel in each production area was implemented. Cadres ideologically established a collectivist concept of mutual assistance and cooperation, and their sense of responsibility and national concept were also strengthened. All of these provided favorable conditions for the comprehensive realization of the one-leader system.

We have gained the following experiences in these two central tasks:

Central tasks are an important method for laying the foundation for enterprise management. The two central tasks of planned management and the responsibility system are aimed at the basic shortcomings in the current enterprise management. Therefore, it helps cadres grasp the key to production management, promotes production, and gives the enterprise management a new look. The establishment and improvement of planned management ensures that the national plan is implemented into the actual actions of each shift, each work section, and each group through daily work systems (work plans, maintenance weekly plans, functional section work weekly plans, etc.), providing conditions for the balanced realization of the national plan. The establishment and improvement of the responsibility system consolidates the organizational foundation of enterprise management, eliminates the chaos in management, and provides a solid material foundation for planned management. For example, although the plant's monthly and weekly equipment maintenance plans were improved during the discussion of planned management, there were still many errors and they were not practical. After the responsibility system campaign, it was clarified that the foreman was responsible for compiling the maintenance plan, which thoroughly solved the problem.

Last year, these two central tasks were almost carried out when the plant had major production technology work, which had a certain impact on production. This situation forced us to consider the method of carrying out central tasks. The first is how to choose the time to launch central tasks. At present, the choice of time does not take into account the specific situation of production, so it often causes losses to both daily production and central tasks. We believe that factory and mine cadres should be given the right to choose the timing for carrying out central tasks, so as not to abandon production and at the same time concentrate some manpower to promote central tasks. At present, central tasks are often carried out in the form of surprise campaigns. During the implementation, the higher levels chase after the lower levels, and everyone strives to be the first, which easily creates a superficial and flashy state of excessive tension. Therefore, it is often the case that "the campaign is vigorous, but the effect is minimal." For example, when discussing the national plan last year, the plant's employees put forward 947 rationalization proposals in 14 days, but after review, only 98 could be adopted. Therefore, the form of surprise campaign should be considered a very uneconomical working method. It makes employees excessively tired, and fosters the cadres' blitzkrieg style, diverting and weakening attention to production problems. In fact, the main advanced experiences and advanced figures in production rarely appear in surprise campaigns. Therefore, we believe that central tasks should not be carried out through short-term, overwhelming campaigns, but should be solved as a major part of all work over a long period. Secondly, it is necessary to distinguish between the requirements for cadres and for the masses. At present, our understanding of this issue is still insufficient. The requirements for cadres are often too low, and the requirements for the masses are often too high. For example, the two major central tasks last year were completely enterprise management work, that is to say, basically the work of factory management personnel, but many comrades insisted on turning it into the business of ordinary workers, which actually weakened the attention to improving cadres and prevented the central tasks from falling into the hands of those who should solve it.

The implementation of central tasks is a very important issue. At present, there is no sufficient implementation period after a short-term surprise campaign, and generally no one cares about the implementation situation. If the central task is carried out as the main link of all work over a long period, the problem of implementation time can also be solved. However, in addition to time, it is also necessary to strengthen inspection, strictly enforce discipline, and establish and utilize a complete set of material reward systems to promote work and promote the improvement of employees' awareness.

Finding out the key ideological problems according to the essence of the central task and the specific ideological situation of employees, and establishing a correct ideological foundation is a prerequisite for promoting the central task. The ideological gap between staff and workers makes planned management (especially labor, cost accounting, finance, training and other plans) impossible to implement, and the existence of decentralized thinking hinders normal division of labor and cooperation. Therefore, when discussing planned management, we strengthened the education of ideological unity between workers and staff, and in the responsibility system campaign, we carried out the education of collectivist spirit. On the other hand, ideological workers also got an inspiration, that is, ideological problems can only be truly solved by combining specific work (such as central tasks).

It is generally recognized that cadres can be improved through central tasks, but this is often forgotten in practice. The main reason, in addition to the problem of the method of implementing central tasks, is that the leading cadres of the plant themselves often do not have a deep understanding of central tasks, so it is difficult to specifically help cadres. Cadres are eager to learn, and it is more effective to educate them using their own experiences. We have not fully utilized the method of establishing typical examples, because the work of cultivating typical examples is poorly done.

It is necessary to strengthen the combination of central tasks and overall work. Everyone attaches great importance to central tasks and has made relatively good progress in leading central tasks, but they have not yet mastered the overall work. Moreover, because the higher authorities pay more attention to the central tasks and less attention to the overall work, cadres from top to bottom have a phenomenon of being tight in one aspect and loose in another. The most harmful is that a dependence mentality gradually grows in the cadres, without considering and delving into the overall work. Therefore, we believe that the main work (central link) of each long period (even not limited to one year) should be clarified, the enterprise's leading cadres should be given a certain degree of autonomy in implementing central tasks, and under this condition, cadres at all levels should be required to be active and responsible in their positions, and implement the working method of combining central tasks and overall work.

The main tasks of our factory this year are: to continue to implement and improve planned management and the responsibility system; to carry out a large number of technical improvement work to explore the source of comprehensively overfulfilling the national plan; to continue to improve labor organization extensively; and to conduct pilot work for establishing and improving the economic accounting system.

    鞍钢炼铁厂进行中心工作的经验
    鞍钢炼铁厂厂长　蔡博
    去年，鞍钢炼铁厂进行了两件中心工作：一件是实行计划管理；一件是贯彻责任制。以实行计划管理这个中心工作作为一个运动，我们搞了两个多月，这个运动的目的是：广泛加强计划观念的教育，树立“国家计划就是法律”的思想；改进作业计划，组织有节奏的协调的生产；健全各种工作的计划管理，保证国家计划的全面实现；加强全体职工干部的团结，促进政治思想的一致。
    经过以实行计划管理为中心工作的运动，全厂制订了全面超额完成任务的先进计划。通过作业计划，加强了各生产部门的配合和联系，特别是贯彻了设备的定期检修和维护工作，并使原料供应正常，这就提高了生产的节奏性。各科对国家计划的责任明确了，各科的作用也发挥出来了，因而加强了整个国家计划所有各方面的计划管理，建立了劳动培训计划的管理制度，实行了定额发料和技术措施管理制度，改进了原始记录。在完成统一的国家计划基础上，加强了工人、职员、技术员、干部之间在思想上政治上的团结，提高了群众觉悟的水平。
    以贯彻责任制度作为中心工作的运动，我们进行了将近三个月，根据本厂的情况，我们确定这一中心工作的目的是：贯彻和推行生产区域管理制，从组织方面巩固计划管理，健全责任制度的基础与严格工作规律。运动的步骤是自上而下，分层解决：首先从各科着手，其次在生产与设备系统的干部中进行，以后则深入到工人小组中去，最后从业务责任制方面加以全面的检查。这样可以使运动稳步发展，并且尽可能使生产工作少受影响。
    经过以贯彻责任制为中心的运动，按生产区域管理制的原则，完成了全厂管理组织的改革工作，明确了原料、机械检修、电气检修、修理场等四工段的组织，进一步明确了职能机构与人员的职责范围。计划管理加强了，一方面彻底弄清了职能机构与人员的分工，另一方面贯彻了各生产区域人员的全面负责制。干部们从思想上树立了互助合作的集体主义观念，责任感和国家观念也加强了。所有这些，使一长制的全面实现得到了有利条件。
    我们在这两次的中心工作中获得了以下的经验：
    中心工作是奠定企业管理基础的一个重要方法。计划管理和责任制这两项中心工作，是针对着目前企业管理中的基本缺点提出来的，因此它帮助干部掌握了生产管理的关键，推动了生产，使企业管理面目为之一新。建立和健全计划管理，使国家计划经过日常工作制度（作业计划，检修周计划，职能科工作周计划等），贯彻到每个班、每个工段、每个小组的实际行动中去，使国家计划得到了均衡实现的条件。建立和健全责任制度，使企业管理的组织基础得到了巩固，使管理的混乱现象被清除，使计划管理有了坚强的物质基础。譬如全厂设备检修的月计划和周计划，在讨论计划管理时虽已有所改进，但错误仍然很多，还不切合实际，经过责任制运动以后，明确了工长负责编制检修计划，这才比较彻底解决了问题。
    去年这两件中心工作，几乎都是在本厂有重大的生产技术工作时进行的，对于生产有一定的影响，这个情况使我们不得不考虑中心工作的作法问题。首先就是如何选择展开中心工作的时间。目前，时间的选择是不照顾生产上的具体情况的，因此，时常使日常生产与中心工作两方面都受损失。我们觉得应给厂矿干部选择进行中心工作的时机的权利，以便既不放弃生产，又能集中部分人力推动中心工作。目前，中心工作又往往是以突击运动的形式进行的。执行时上面层层追赶，下面就人人争先，极易造成表面的、华而不实的过分紧张状态，因此，常常是“运动轰轰烈烈，效果渺渺茫茫”，譬如，去年讨论国家计划时，全厂职工在十四天内提出了九百四十七件合理化建议，但经过审查后，仅有九十八件可以采纳。所以突击运动的形式应认为是一种极不经济的工作方法，它使职工过分疲劳，并且滋长了干部的突击作风，转移与削弱对生产问题的注意。事实上，生产中主要的先进经验与先进人物，很少是在突击运动中出现的。所以我们觉得中心工作不应经过短时期的，压倒一切的运动来进行，而应在长时期内当作全部工作的主要一环来解决。其次，必须区别对干部与对群众的要求。对这个问题目前我们认识仍有不足，要求干部往往过低，要求群众往往过高。譬如去年的两大中心工作，完全是企业管理工作，也就是说，基本上是工厂管理人员的工作，但许多同志却偏偏要把它变成一般工人的事，这样就实际上削弱了对提高干部的注意，使中心工作不能落在应解决它的人的手里。
    对于中心工作的贯彻是一个很重要的问题，目前，在短期的突击运动后没有足够的贯彻时期，并且对于贯彻情况，一般也无人过问。如果把中心工作作为长时期内全部工作的主要环节来进行，贯彻的时间问题也就可以得到解决。不过除时间之外，还必须加强检查，严格纪律，并建立和利用成套的物质奖励制度，以促进工作，促进职工觉悟程度的提高。
    根据中心工作的本质与职工思想的具体情况找出关键思想问题，树立正确的思想基础，是推动中心工作的先决条件。职员与工人思想上的隔阂，使计划管理（特别是劳动、成本财务、培训等计划）不能实行，分散思想的存在阻碍着正常的分工与合作，所以我们在讨论计划管理时，加强了工人与职员思想团结的教育，而在责任制运动中又进行了集体主义精神的教育，另一方面对思想工作人员来讲也得到一个启发，就是必须结合具体工作（例如中心工作）才能真正解决思想问题。
    经过中心工作提高干部，这点是众所公认的，但在工作时却往往被忘掉了，主要原因除了执行中心工作的方法有问题而外，就是厂的领导干部往往自己对中心工作也无深刻的认识，所以也很难具体地去帮助干部。干部是渴望学习的，如果能利用其亲身的经验进行教育，则更有效。树立典型的办法我们目前尚未充分利用，其原因是培植典型的工作作得差。
    必须加强中心工作与全面工作的结合。大家对中心工作都相当重视，在领导中心工作方面也比较有进步，但对全面工作仍然未掌握起来，而且由于上级对中心工作追得多，对全面工作则不大注意，所以干部从上到下都有一紧一松的现象，最有害的则是在干部中逐渐滋长着依赖思想，不考虑和不钻研全面工作。所以我们认为，应当明确每一长时期（甚至不以一年为限）的主要工作（中心环节），赋与企业领导干部一定的执行中心工作的自主权，在此条件下要求各级干部在自己的岗位上积极负责，贯彻中心工作与全面工作相结合的工作方法。
    我厂今年的主要工作是：继续贯彻和健全计划管理与责任制度；大量进行技术改进工作，发掘超额全面完成国家计划的泉源；继续广泛地改进劳动组织；进行建立与健全经济核算制的试点工作。
