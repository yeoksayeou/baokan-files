    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, March 26th: To accumulate funds for national industrialization, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various production plants and mines have proposed savings targets for 1954. According to these targets, production costs this year should be reduced by 6% compared to the original plan, and the turnover cycle of working capital should be shortened by 20 days. The reduction in production costs alone will save the state enough funds to build nearly two modern blast furnaces throughout the year.
    On March 20th, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a mobilization meeting for the 1954 savings campaign, requiring all employees to combine the study of the general line and discussions of the annual production plan, and to carry out a mass savings campaign. They should formulate annual savings plans and measures to ensure the completion of the 1954 savings task. At the meeting, eight units with outstanding savings achievements in 1953, such as the No. 5 open-hearth furnace of the Steelmaking Plant and the Wang Qilun group of the Refractory Brick Plant, as well as five production personnel with outstanding savings achievements, such as Zhang Yiliang and Liu Yuanfang, were rewarded.
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company achieved great results in increasing production and practicing economy in 1953, and many advanced units and figures emerged, creating many savings methods and experiences. This has prepared favorable conditions for launching a mass savings campaign this year. Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the state's production and financial plans: the total industrial output value exceeded the plan by more than 13%, the profits turned over to the state exceeded the plan by more than 4%, and the reduction in costs (calculated by physical objects) exceeded the plan by more than 18%. Due to the more rational use of working capital, the total production value in 1953 increased by more than 40% compared to 1952, and the amount of working capital occupied decreased by several hundred billion yuan. Many saving methods and experiences created by various production plants and mines last year mainly included reducing raw material consumption, utilizing waste, saving tools, and reducing the occupation of working capital. In particular, the saving of raw materials is of great significance. The saving methods created by the No. 5 open-hearth furnace of the Steelmaking Plant mainly included saving gas and using fixed materials for steelmaking. From September to December last year, this open-hearth furnace saved nearly one-fifth of gas on average each month, saving a total of 350 tons of steel and iron materials. The main saving method of the Medium-sized Rolling Mill was to increase the product yield rate and reduce the scrap rate. The plant implemented a worker post responsibility system, trial rolling with waste materials, and a waste product recovery system. Last year, it saved a total of 18.2 billion yuan worth of steel billets. The boiler section of the Power Plant and the Refractory Brick Plant mainly used low-value coal instead of good coal as fuel, saving huge amounts of funds. The Sixth Engineering Team of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Welfare Office also saved 3.8 billion yuan last year by utilizing waste boilers, waste transformers, etc.

    为国家社会主义工业化积累资金
    鞍钢各厂矿开展群众性节约运动
    【新华社鞍山二十六日电】鞍山钢铁公司各生产厂矿为了给国家工业化积累资金，已提出一九五四年的节约指标。根据这个指标，今年的生产成本要比原计划降低百分之六，流动资金要缩短周期二十天。仅生产成本降低一项，全年为国家节约的资金将可以新建近两座现代化炼铁炉。
    三月二十日，鞍山钢铁公司举行了一九五四年节约运动动员大会，要求全体职工结合总路线学习和讨论全年生产计划等工作，开展群众性的节约运动，制订出全年节约计划和节约措施，保证一九五四年节约任务的完成。这次会上同时对一九五三年炼钢厂五号平炉、耐火砖厂王启伦小组等八个节约有成绩的单位和章一梁、刘元芳等五个节约成绩突出的生产人员进行了奖励。
    鞍钢各生产厂矿一九五三年增产节约成绩很大，并出现了许多先进单位和先进人物，创造了许多节约办法和经验。这给今年开展群众性的节约运动准备了有利的条件。去年鞍钢超额完成了国家生产财务计划：计工业总产值超额百分之十三多，上缴国家利润超额百分之四多，降低的成本（按实物计算）超额百分之十八多。由于更合理地使用流动资金，一九五三年的生产总值比一九五二年增长了百分之四十多，流动资金的占用数减少了几千亿元。各生产厂矿去年创造的许多节约的办法和经验，主要是减少原材料消耗、利用废物、节省工具、减少占用流动资金等，其中特别是原材料的节约有很大的意义。炼钢厂五号平炉创造的节约办法主要是节省瓦斯和定料炼钢。这座平炉从去年九月到十二月，平均每月节省瓦斯近五分之一，节省钢、铁料合三百五十吨钢水。中型轧钢厂主要节约办法是提高产品收得率、降低废品率。该厂实行了工人岗位专责制、用废料试轧和废品回收制等，去年共节省了一百八十二亿元的钢坯。发电厂锅炉工段和耐火砖厂等单位，主要是用低值煤代替好煤作燃料，节省了巨额资金。鞍钢福利处第六工程队由于利用废锅炉、废变压器等，去年也节约了三十八亿元。
