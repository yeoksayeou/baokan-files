Datong State-owned Coal Mine is supplying various regions with more and more high-grade power coal to meet the needs of industrial development year by year. This year, Datong Coal Mine's planned output has increased by 45 percent compared to last year, and nearly 100 state-owned and locally state-owned factories and enterprises across the country have signed order contracts with the mine. Trains loaded with Datong coal are constantly heading to vast areas, from Qingdao in the east to Baotou in the west, from Wuhan in the south to Shanhaiguan in the north, continuously supplying Daye Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, East China Iron and Steel Company, Tianjin Steel Plant, and Longyan Iron Mine. It also supplies more than 130 stations on over ten railway lines under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin and Taiyuan Railway Bureaus, thirteen factories producing various building materials such as the Beijing Liulihe Cement Plant, light industrial factories such as paper mills, textile mills, and printing and dyeing plants in various regions, as well as dozens of locally state-owned factories and enterprises in North China. In addition, China Coal Industry Building Materials Company is also continuously selling Datong's coal to more than 120 cities and towns across the country, supplying the needs of local small-scale industry and handicrafts.

The recovery and development speed of Datong Coal Mine has been very rapid in recent years. When it was just liberated in 1949, the equipment of all mines in Datong Coal Mine, formerly known as the Eight Great Mines, was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit gangs, and the mines had accumulated millions of tons of water. From 1950 to 1952, four large mines have successively resumed production. The restoration projects of the Xinzhou Kiln, Baidong, and Baitu Kiln mines also started in the second half of last year. The output in 1953 reached 10.58 times that of 1950. At the same time, Datong Coal Mine began to comprehensively promote the Soviet Union's advanced longwall coal mining method in 1951, and has continuously added a large number of mechanical equipment over the years, implementing mechanized mining. Therefore, the labor productivity of employees has also increased rapidly. By 1953, the total number of employees in the mine was less than half of that during the Japanese occupation, but the annual output of the four mines had exceeded the highest annual output of the eight mines during the Japanese occupation.

Xinhua News Agency: Furthermore, in order to quickly meet the growing demand for industrial coal, Datong Coal Mine will fully rebuild the existing mines in two to three years, so that the total coal production of the mine can increase to more than three times last year's output by 1957, which is approximately equal to the output of Fushun Coal Mine, currently the largest coal mine in China. This reconstruction plan was determined based on the data obtained from geological drilling in seven mining areas over the past year.

Although the four old mining areas and the three mines under restoration such as Xinzhou Kiln in Datong Coal Mine have suffered years of plunder and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit gangs, drilling over the past year has proved that the underground coal reserves are still very large, most of which exceed the expected and previously known figures. In the Si Laogou mining area, which was originally believed to have only 44 million tons of coal remaining, the explored reserves increased by four and a half times in this drilling area, which was only one-tenth larger than the original mining area. It was previously believed that the Xinzhou Kiln mining area had no seventh coal seam at all, but now it has been discovered that this coal seam not only exists, but also has an average thickness of more than three meters, with a maximum of ten meters. The reserves of this single coal seam amount to more than 50 million tons. Due to the increased known coal reserves, the designed annual production capacity of three pairs of planned reconstruction shafts has been increased by another one-third.

These seven mining areas are not only rich in reserves, but also have very good natural conditions, which are very beneficial for saving national construction investment and future safe mining. The results of the drilling show that the gas content of the coal seams in each mine is very small, and gas explosion accidents that threaten the safety of the mine and workers are not likely to occur during mining. Therefore, the equipment for preventing gas explosions can be greatly reduced. At the same time, the rocks on both sides of the coal seams in each mine are very strong sandstone, and serious roof and floor collapse accidents are not likely to occur. Therefore, the underground roadways dug out can be built with little or no cement or stone slabs. The wood used to support the roof can also be greatly saved. According to preliminary estimates, due to the many particularly superior natural conditions of Datong Coal Mine, the national investment required to build a pair of mines will be one-quarter less than that required to build mines with the same output in other general coal mines.

In the geological drilling work over the past year, geological personnel also conducted detailed research and calculations on thin coal seams that were previously considered unminable, based on the Soviet Union's advanced coal mining standards. As a result, the minable coal seams in the Jurassic coalfields of each mine have increased from the previously determined seven to nine to eleven layers. This will allow precious national resources to be fully utilized.

Currently, the geological reports for these seven mining areas have been compiled in detail and provided to the design department. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大同煤矿增产动力用煤供应各地
    将在两三年内全面改建现有矿井
    国营大同煤矿正以一年比一年更多的高级动力用煤供应各地工业发展的需要。今年，大同煤矿的计划产量比去年又增加了百分之四十五，全国近百个国营、地方国营工厂企业已和该矿签订订货合同。一列列满载大同煤炭的火车，正不断地驶往东起青岛、西到包头、南起武汉、北到山海关的广大地区，源源供应着大冶钢厂、太原钢铁厂、石景山钢铁厂、华东钢铁公司、天津钢厂和龙烟铁矿，供应着天津、太原等铁路管理局所辖十多条铁路干线上的一百三十多个车站，北京琉璃河水泥厂等十三个生产各种建筑材料的工厂，各地造纸、纺织、印染等轻工业工厂以及华北地区的数十个地方国营工厂企业。另外，中国煤业建筑器材公司还不断地把大同的煤销售到全国大小一百二十多个城市和集镇，供应当地小型工业和手工业的需要。
    大同煤矿这几年恢复和发展的速度很快。一九四九年刚解放时，大同煤矿过去号称八大矿的所有矿井设备几乎全部被日寇和蒋阎匪帮毁坏，矿井积水达数百万吨。从一九五零年开始到一九五二年，该矿已有四个大矿先后恢复了生产。忻州窑、白洞、白土窑等三大矿的恢复工程也从去年下半年开始。一九五三年的产量已达到一九五零年的十点五八倍。同时，大同煤矿从一九五一年开始就全面推广了苏联先进的长壁式新采煤法，几年来陆续增添大批机械设备，实行了机械化开采。因此，职工的劳动生产率提高也很快。到一九五三年，全矿职工还不及日寇统治时期的半数，四个矿的年产量却已超过日寇统治时期八个矿的最高年产量。
    又讯：为了迅速满足日益增长的工业用煤的需要，大同煤矿将在两三年内全面改建现有矿井，使全矿的产煤量到一九五七年时能增加到去年产量的三倍以上，约等于目前我国第一大煤矿——抚顺煤矿的产量。这一改建计划是根据一年多来在七个矿区内进行地质钻探所得的资料确定的。
    大同煤矿的四个老矿区和忻州窑等三个正在恢复的矿区，虽然曾遭受过日寇和蒋阎匪帮的多年掠夺和破坏，但一年多来的钻探证明地下煤的储量仍然很大，大部分都超过预期的和过去已知的数字。原来认为只剩下四千四百多万吨煤的四老沟矿区，这次钻探区域只比原矿区大十分之一，探明的储量就增加了四倍半。过去认为忻州窑矿区根本没有第七层煤，现在发现这层煤不仅有，而且平均厚度在三公尺以上，最高达十公尺，单这一层煤的储量就有五千多万吨。由于已知煤的储量增加，有三对计划改建的井口已把设计的年产能力再提高三分之一。
    这七个矿区不但储量丰富，而且自然条件也很好，对于节省国家的建设投资和将来的安全开采都很有利。钻探的结果表明：各矿的煤层瓦斯量都很小，开采时不容易发生威胁矿井和工人安全的瓦斯爆炸事故，因此防止瓦斯爆炸的设备装置可以大大减省。同时，各矿煤层两边的岩石都是很坚固的砂岩，不容易发生严重的顶底板塌落事故，因此开凿出来的井下巷道可以很少用或不必用水泥或石板来砌；用来支撑顶板的木料也可以大大节省。据初步估计，由于大同煤矿有着这许多特别优越的自然条件，建设一对矿井所需的国家投资，要比其他一般煤矿建设同样产量的矿井少用四分之一。
    在一年多来的地质钻探工作中，地质人员们还根据苏联先进的采煤标准，对过去认为不可采的薄煤层作了详细的研究和计算，因而各矿侏罗纪煤田的可采煤层都由过去断定的七层增加到九层到十一层，这样就使宝贵的国家资源可以得到充分的利用。
    现在，这七个矿区的地质报告书已详细地编写好，并已提供给设计部门。（新华社）
