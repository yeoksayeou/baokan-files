    Four Drilling Rigs, Including Construction No. of the Sixth Fourth One Team of the Central Geological Department,
    Complete First Quarter Drilling Footage Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Four drilling rigs of the Sixth Fourth One Team of the Central Geological Department have completed the first quarter drilling footage plan twenty or nineteen days ahead of schedule. The quality meets the standards. They have set an example for the whole team to complete or overfulfill the first quarter's plan.
    As of March 11, the completion of the first quarter's plan was as follows: Construction No. drilling rig overfulfilled by 3.11 percent; 308 drilling rig overfulfilled by 1.06 percent; 503 drilling rig overfulfilled by 2.8 percent. On March 12, the 512 drilling rig overfulfilled by 0.72 percent. The quality (core recovery rate) is all above 80 percent, meeting the standards set by the Central Geological Department. By the end of March, the excess production of the four drilling rigs will be equivalent to the production volume of one drilling rig for four and a half months.
    The workers operating these four drilling rigs have further improved their political awareness in studying the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. In the first quarter's production process, they conscientiously applied various advanced production experiences, increased pure drilling time, and improved drilling efficiency. For example, the 503 drilling rig, as a result of promoting the Soviet advanced experience of "mud slurry operation method," preserved the well wall, prevented minor water leakage, reduced the number of hole sweeps, and increased the time utilization rate by more than 40 percent. At the same time, they conscientiously implemented various systems, such as the shift handover system, the division of labor responsibility system, the five-day work plan, the ten-minute production meeting, etc., and strictly abided by the technical operation regulations, reducing downhole accidents and mechanical accidents, and greatly improving production efficiency.

    中央地质部六四一队建设号等四台钻机
    提前完成第一季度钻探进尺计划
    中央地质部六四一队，已有四台钻机提前二十天或十九天完成第一季度钻探进尺计划。质量合乎标准。为全队钻机完成或超额完成第一季度计划，树立了榜样。
    到三月十一日，完成第一季度计划情况为：建设号钻机超额百分之三点一一；三零八钻机超额百分之一点零六；五零三钻机超额百分之二点八。三月十二日，五一二钻机超额百分之零点七二。质量（岩芯采取率）都在百分之八十以上，合乎中央地质部所定标准。到三月底，四部钻机超额生产部分，将相当一部钻机四个半月的生产量。
    开动这四部钻机的职工，在学习国家过渡时期总路线总任务中，进一步提高了政治觉悟。他们在第一季度生产过程中，认真运用了各项先进生产经验，增加了纯钻时间，提高了钻进效率。如五零三钻机，推行苏联先进经验“泥浆作业法”的结果，保全了井壁，防止了小的漏水，减少扫孔次数，提高时间利用率百分之四十以上。同时，认真执行了各种制度，交接班制、分工负责制、五日作业计划、十分钟生产会议等和严格遵守技术操作规程，减少了孔内事故和机械事故，大大提高了生产效率。
