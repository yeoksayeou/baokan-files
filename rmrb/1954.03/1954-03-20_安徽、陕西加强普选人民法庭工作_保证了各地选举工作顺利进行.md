Anhui and Shaanxi provinces, while comprehensively launching grassroots election work, have strengthened the work of popularly elected people's courts to ensure the smooth progress of election work in various regions. According to incomplete statistics, Anhui Province has established 469 popularly elected people's courts, and Shaanxi Province has established 88 popularly elected people's courts in 33 counties in the Guanzhong area alone.

　　The popularly elected people's courts established in Anhui Province have accepted thousands of lawsuits concerning voter qualification issues in the grassroots elections. In the ten townships of Qingjian District, Chaoxian County, there were more than 400 pending cases related to voter qualifications. After the people's court assisted in the review, they were quickly resolved. When Guantang Township in the eastern suburbs of Hefei City was reviewing voter qualifications, some people demanded that women with ideological and work style shortcomings be deprived of their right to vote. Later, after the people's court explained the provisions of the Election Law to the masses, they participated in the election in the same way. At the same time, the people's court strictly sentenced those landlord class elements who had not changed their status and reactionary elements who attempted to steal the right to vote and undermine the election. Zhang Shaokang, a landlord class element in Huancheng District, Wuhu City, who had not changed his status, concealed his true status during voter registration and stole the qualifications of a representative candidate. After the staff of the people's court conducted an investigation in Zhang Shaokang's hometown, he was finally deprived of his right to vote and stand for election.

　　The popularly elected people's courts in many counties in Shaanxi Province have stipulated the specific work steps of the court in accordance with the various stages of the popular election work. For example, during population investigation, voter registration, and review of voter qualifications, the court, in conjunction with the election committee and public security and procuratorial organs, conducts strict reviews of unadjudicated criminal offenders, controlled elements, and those on probation, parole, and early release in the electoral district to determine whether they have political rights. At the same time, in coordination with the election committee and work team, it publicizes the significance of the popular election and the tasks of the popularly elected people's court, encourages the masses to report illegal acts that undermine the election, and file lawsuits on voter qualification issues. In order to facilitate people's litigation, the popularly elected people's courts in various parts of the province have delineated jurisdiction and patrol areas, and publicized the scope of cases accepted by the popularly elected people's courts to the masses in the form of announcements, so that the broad masses have received legal education related to elections and improved the enthusiasm of voters to participate in the popular election.

    安徽、陕西加强普选人民法庭工作
    保证了各地选举工作顺利进行
    安徽、陕西两省在基层选举工作全面展开的同时，加强了普选人民法庭的工作，保证各地选举工作顺利进行。据不完全统计，安徽省已建立了四百六十九个普选人民法庭，陕西省仅关中地区三十三个县就已建立了八十八个普选人民法庭。
    安徽省建立的普选人民法庭，在基层选举中已受理了几千件有关选民资格问题的诉讼案件。巢县清涧区的十个乡原有四百多件有关选民资格的悬案，经过人民法庭协助审查，很快都得到解决。合肥市东郊区官塘乡在审查选民资格时，部分群众曾要求剥夺那些思想作风有缺点的妇女的选举权利，后来经过人民法庭向群众讲解了选举法的规定，使她们一样地参加了选举。人民法庭同时严格地判处了那些企图窃取选举权利的未经改变成份的地主阶级分子和破坏选举的反动分子。芜湖市环城区未经改变成份的地主阶级分子张少康，在选民登记时隐瞒了自己的真实成份，并窃取了代表候选人的资格。经过人民法庭工作人员到张少康原籍进行调查后，最后剥夺了他的选举权和被选举权。
    陕西省许多县的普选人民法庭都按照普选工作进行的各个阶段，规定了法庭的具体工作步骤。如在人口调查、选民登记和审查选民资格时，法庭便协同选举委员会和公安、检察机关，对选区内未判决的刑事犯、管制分子和缓刑、保释及提前释放的人犯，进行严格审查，确定其有无政治权利。同时配合选举委员会和工作组，宣传普选的意义和普选人民法庭的任务，启发群众检举破坏选举的违法行为和对选民资格问题提出诉讼。为了便利人民诉讼，该省各地普选人民法庭都划定管辖和巡回区域，并用通告的形式向群众宣传普选人民法庭受理案件的范围，使广大群众受到了有关选举的法纪教育，提高了选民参加普选的热情。　　　（新华社）
