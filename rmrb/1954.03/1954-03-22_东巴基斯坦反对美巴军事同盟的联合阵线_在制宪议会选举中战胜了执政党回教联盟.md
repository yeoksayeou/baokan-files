East Pakistan's United Front Against the US-Pakistan Military Alliance
Defeats the Ruling Muslim League in the Constituent Assembly Elections

(Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, March 17th) TASS reports from Karachi on the 17th that elections for the Constituent Assembly were held in East Pakistan from the 8th to the 12th. These elections in Pakistan are of great significance because East Pakistan is home to more than half of Pakistan's population (i.e., 42 million of the 76 million residents). These elections took place precisely when Pakistan and the United States were conducting negotiations on military "aid" and a military alliance, and are therefore of great concern. The attitude towards forming a military alliance with the United States was one of the main issues in this campaign. Representatives of all major opposition parties in East Pakistan expressed opposition to forming a military alliance with the United States.

The ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League, competed against the United Front of opposition parties. The United Front included: the East Pakistan People's Muslim League, the East Pakistan branch of the Pakistan Communist Party, the East Pakistan Peasants and Workers Party, the East Pakistan branch of the Socialist Party, and organizations of Hindus in East Pakistan. According to preliminary information, the United Front completely defeated the Muslim League. A candidate from the United Front—Khaliz Nawaz Khan, one of the leaders of the East Pakistan Student Union—was victorious, defeating the ruling party's candidate, Nurul Amin, the Chief Minister of East Pakistan. East Pakistan's Minister of Transportation, Hasan Ali, and Minister of Education, Abdul Hamid, were also defeated. Newspapers believe that the election results in East Pakistan are an unpleasant event for the United States, disrupting the US plan to turn Pakistan into its base.

(Xinhua News Agency, March 20th) According to a United Press report on the 19th, as of the evening of the 19th, the vote count for the East Pakistan Constituent Assembly elections was as follows: the United Front won 134 seats, the ruling Pakistan Muslim League won 4 seats, independents won 8 seats, and other parties won 16 seats.

(Xinhua News Agency) According to TASS reports: The spring session of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly opened on the 16th. Pakistan's Finance Minister, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, presented the budget for 1954-1955. Among them, the military expenditure was 640.5 million rupees, accounting for 58 percent of the total annual income. In addition, another 159.5 million rupees will be spent on military affairs in this year; this expense will mainly be supplied by foreign debt, domestic debt, and foreign "aid."

On the 17th, during the budget debate in the Constituent Assembly, Rajkumari Chakravarty, secretary of the Pakistan National Congress, said that the planned US military "aid" to Pakistan would result in "selling out Pakistan's independence."

    东巴基斯坦反对美巴军事同盟的联合阵线
    在制宪议会选举中战胜了执政党回教联盟
      【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩十七日讯：东巴基斯坦从八日到十二日举行了制宪议会的选举。巴基斯坦这次选举具有重大的意义，因为东巴基斯坦居住着巴基斯坦一半以上的人口（即七千六百万居民中的四千二百万居民）。这次选举在正当巴基斯坦和美国进行军事“援助”和军事同盟的谈判的时候举行，因此非常令人关心。对于和美国缔结军事同盟一事的态度，是这次竞选的主要问题之一。东巴基斯坦所有主要的反对党代表，都表示反对和美国缔结军事同盟。
    执政党——巴基斯坦回教联盟和反对党的联合阵线进行了竞选。加入联合阵线的有：东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟、巴基斯坦共产党东巴基斯坦组织、东巴基斯坦农工党、社会党东巴基斯坦组织以及东巴基斯坦的印度教徒的组织。根据初步材料，联合阵线完全战胜了回教联盟。联合阵线的候选人——东巴基斯坦学生联合会的领袖之一哈立兹·纳瓦兹汗获得胜利，击败了执政党的候选人——东巴基斯坦首席部长努鲁尔·阿明。东巴基斯坦交通部长哈山·阿里和教育部长阿布杜尔·哈密德也遭到了失败。报纸认为，东巴基斯坦的选举结果对于美国是一件不愉快的事件，打乱了美国想把巴基斯坦变为自己的基地的算盘。
    【新华社二十日讯】据合众社十九日消息，东巴基斯坦制宪议会选举的开票结果截至十九日晚为止，计：联合阵线获得了一百三十四席，执政党巴基斯坦回教联盟得四席，无党派人士得八席，其他党派得十六席。
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：巴基斯坦制宪议会春季会议在十六日开幕。巴基斯坦政府财政部长乔德里·穆罕默德·阿里提出了一九五四—一九五五年度的预算。其中，军费数目是六亿四千零五十万卢比，占全年总收入的百分之五十八。此外，在这一年度还将再在军事方面花费一亿五千九百五十万卢比；这笔费用主要将由外债、内债和外“援”来供给。
    十七日，制宪议会举行预算辩论时，巴基斯坦国大党书记拉志库马里·查克拉瓦蒂说，策划中的美国对巴基斯坦军事“援助”的结果，会是“出卖巴基斯坦的独立”。
