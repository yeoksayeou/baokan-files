    Record of Soviet Grain Storage Pest Control Experts Visiting Pest-Free Grain Depots in Yu Hang County
    Xie Kaichun, Zhu Datong
    In October of last year, Soviet grain storage pest control expert Morozov, accompanied by personnel from the East China Grain Bureau and other departments, visited the pest-free grain depots in Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province. Morozov praised the work order and environmental sanitation here. During the visit, he also gave some valuable suggestions to the grain storage staff, based on many facts.
    When Morozov walked into the gate of the Second Branch of the Grain Depot in the district, he saw several bamboo twig brooms neatly standing on the left side of the door corner. He said, "The placement of these brooms is scientific because they are far from the warehouse, which can prevent infection, and the work is also very convenient. You can take a broom as soon as you enter the door." As he spoke, he walked through the small patio, stepped onto the stone steps, and bent down to look at the ridges under the granary, examining one after another. Although the light inside the ridges was not strong, they were clean and flat, with no dust or garbage. After inspecting the outside of the warehouse, he entered the granary (which was an empty warehouse). He felt around the crossbars with his hands, dipped his finger in saliva and wiped it on the plank walls. Then, he stepped on the warehouse planks and selected four or five ventilation bamboo baskets from the neatly arranged ones inside the warehouse and tapped them. Although he inspected so carefully, he did not find any insects and saw very little dust. So, he said, "The cleaning and sanitation here are done very thoroughly. Without constant attention, such good results cannot be achieved."
    After Morozov visited several empty warehouses, he requested to visit warehouses storing grain. The director of the district grain depot accompanied him to another branch warehouse. This was a civilian house warehouse that had not yet been rebuilt. The floor of the warehouse was paved with square bricks, and rice husk bamboo mats were used as a base for moisture protection. One-third of the grain stored in the three warehouse rooms was rice from 1952. Morozov first used bamboo sticks to dig and pick for insects in the seams, holes, and gaps around the outside of the warehouse. After searching for a while and not finding any insects, he happily entered the warehouse. Once inside, he reached into the grain pile to check, but still did not find any insects. After that, he used a sieve to sieve the rice, sieving about one kilogram of rice each time, four or five times in total. As a result, he sieved out one rice weevil and a few sawtoothed grain beetles. He determined that these insects were brought in from the rice husks. Then, he turned up a corner of the bamboo mat and took out a lot of the large rice husks underneath, using a sieve to sieve out tiny insects such as flour mites, round grain beetles, sawtoothed grain beetles, and rice lice. Morozov pointed to these insects and said to the storage personnel present, "The insects in the rice are infected from the rice husks. Insects like to live in dark and dirty places. Therefore, cleaning and sanitation of the grain depot is the most effective method to prevent and eliminate grain storage pests. But be aware that the cleaning and sanitation of the grain depot cannot be effective with a one-time effort or a superficial effort. It must become a regular and important task."
    Morozov finally walked to a very narrow and dark aisle next to the warehouse. He felt and checked as he walked, all the way to the back patio. Here, he saw that the small room for storing equipment was neatly storing scales, bamboo mats, rice husks, and scrap iron, and it also looked very clean. He believed that separating the rice husks from the warehouse properly and concentrating the unused tools were reasonable.
    After Morozov finished looking at this grain depot, he watched the storage staff lock the gate. He said excitedly, "This grain depot can be used as a model for grain storage work." He suggested that it would be best to organize grain storage personnel from various places to visit here, promote these work experiences, and continuously improve them. (Xinhua News Agency)

    记苏联仓虫防治专家参观余杭县无虫粮仓
    谢开春　朱大同
    去年十月间，苏联仓虫防治专家莫若洛夫在华东粮食局等部门的人员的陪同下，参观了浙江省余杭县的无虫粮仓。莫若洛夫对这儿的工作秩序和环境卫生表示称赞，他在参观时并结合许多事实向粮食保管工作人员提了一些宝贵的意见。
    莫若洛夫走进仓前区粮库第二分仓的大门时，看到左侧门角边整齐地竖摆着几把竹枝扫帚，他便说：“这些扫帚放置的地位是科学的，因它距离仓房很远，可以防止感染，工作也很方便，一进门就能取用扫帚。”他边说边走，通过小天井，踏上石阶，弯腰俯视廒仓底下的地垅，看过了这条又看另一条。地垅里面虽然光线不强，但里面光洁平坦找不到灰尘和垃圾。他看完了仓外就进入廒仓（这是一座空仓）。他用手在横档里摸，用手指沾上口沫在板壁上擦，然后脚蹬着仓板，从那仓里边排列整齐的通风竹篓中，选取了四、五个竹篓加以敲击。他虽然这样细致地检查，但没有发现虫子，也很少看到灰尘。于是，他说：“这里的清洁卫生做得很彻底，如果不是经常注意，是不能有这样好的成绩的。”
    莫若洛夫参观几座空仓后，要求参观存着粮食的仓库。区粮库主任陪着他到了另一个分仓。这是一座尚未改建的民房仓，仓底地面是方砖铺成的，并用砻糠竹席垫底防潮，三间仓房所存的粮食有三分之一是一九五二年的稻谷。莫若洛天先在仓外四周的缝、孔、洞隙等处，用竹扦挖剔找虫子。找了些时候，没有发现虫子，他很高兴地步入了仓内。进了仓，他就伸手在粮堆里检查，也没有找着虫子。此后，他又用筛子来筛稻谷，筛了四、五次，每次约筛一公斤的稻谷，结果筛出了一只米象和少数锯谷盗。他判明这些虫子都是砻糠里带来的。接着他就翻起一角竹席取出很多垫底的大糠，用筛子筛出了粉螨、圆珠虫、锯谷盗和米虱等细小虫子。莫若洛夫指着这些虫子对到场的保管人员说：“稻谷里的虫子是从砻糠里感染过去的。虫子喜欢栖息在阴暗肮脏的地方，因此，粮仓的清洁卫生是防治和消灭仓虫最有效的方法。但要注意，粮仓的清洁卫生不是突击一下或表面做一下能发生效用的，要使它成为经常的重要工作。”
    莫若洛夫最后走到仓房旁的一条很狭很暗的过道，他边摸边检查，一直走到后天井。在这里，他看到贮藏器材的小房间里很整齐地存有磅秤、竹席、砻糠和废铁等，一看也很清洁。他认为把大糠和仓房作适当的隔离，以及不用的工具集中放置，都是合理的。
    莫若洛夫看完了这个粮仓，看保管员锁好了大门，他兴奋地说：“此地的粮仓可作为粮食保管工作的典范。”他并建议，最好是组织各地的粮食保管人员到这里来参观，推广这些工作经验，并不断予以改进。（新华社）
