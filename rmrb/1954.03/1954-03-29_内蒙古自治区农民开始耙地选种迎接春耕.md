    Farmers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have begun harrowing and selecting seeds to prepare for spring plowing.
   [Our Newspaper] The spring plowing preparation work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is being further developed. Farmers in many areas have begun harrowing and dragging the land, and are actively preparing seeds to welcome spring sowing. Twelve banners and counties including Duolun have now accumulated more than 4.76 million cartloads of fertilizer, and more than 50% of the manure has been sent to the fields. Sarachi and Horinger counties have rolled approximately 100,000 mu of land. Eight banners and counties including Sarachi have prepared 1,837,000 jin of wheat seeds and 1,320,000 jin of other seeds. The masses in Keshiketeng Banner and Aru Banner have selected 1,060,000 jin of seeds. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams with the appropriate conditions are formulating production plans and preparing for timely sowing. Based on past experience, many places have carried out drought prevention work early before the start of spring plowing and sowing, and the construction of canals, dams, and spring irrigation work is actively underway.
    In order to meet the needs of farmers' spring plowing production, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are supplying farmers with agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and other production materials. According to incomplete statistics, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the region have supplied more than 36,000 pieces of various large and small agricultural tools, 9,341 head of draught animals, and 850,000 jin of various pesticides. In the Hetao area, Fengzhen, Butha Banner and other places, handicraft industry meetings were also held to organize rural handicraft industries to repair and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers.
    In the spring plowing preparation work, all localities are also paying attention to solving the production and livelihood difficulties of disaster-stricken households, families of revolutionary martyrs, and military dependents. For example, Sarachi County has 32 severely affected townships, and the masses lack seeds, food, and fodder for livestock. The leading organs of Sarachi County mobilized the masses to help each other solve difficulties, and promptly issued loans, relief funds, and allocated grain to support farmers' spring plowing.

Capital's Thirty-Two Factories and Enterprises Complete First Quarter Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 28th] As of March 27th, thirty-two state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and enterprises in the capital have completed the state production plan for the first quarter ahead of schedule. These include major factories and enterprises such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Beijing People's Machinery Plant, the Beijing Municipal Metal Structure Factory, and the Fengtai Railway Transportation Branch Bureau.
    In completing the state production plan for the first quarter, many employees studied Wang Chonglun's pioneering and innovative spirit. Workers at No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant lined the sand ditch for molten iron with refractory bricks, which made the molten iron flow smoothly and prevented iron tumors from forming on the edge of the ditch, producing more than eight tons of pig iron per day. The workers and technicians of the Liu Jianjie group in the machining workshop of the Beijing People's Machinery Plant combined to improve the chuck, and the entire group completed two and a half months of work in February. Wang Junling, head of the planning section of Qinghe Woolen Mill, proposed improving the production process in the preparation workshop, which greatly improved the working conditions of workers and increased output by 53.3%. Xing Hanzhang and Wang Baoqing, electric welders at the Beijing Municipal Metal Structure Factory, created the "double arc welding method," which solved the critical problem of insufficient motors.

    内蒙古自治区农民开始耙地选种迎接春耕
   【本报讯】内蒙古自治区的春耕准备工作正在进一步展开。很多地区农民已开始耙地、拖地，并积极准备籽种，迎接春耕播种。多伦等十二个旗县现已积肥四百七十六万多车，百分之五十以上的粪已送到地里。萨拉齐、和林格尔两县已磙地约十万余亩。萨拉齐等八个旗县已准备好小麦籽种一百八十三万七千斤和其他籽种一百三十二万斤。克什克腾旗、阿鲁旗的群众，已选好籽种一百零六万斤。各地农业生产合作社和有条件的互助组，纷纷制订生产计划，准备及时进行播种。很多地方根据过去的经验，在春耕播种开始前，就及早进行了防旱工作，修渠、打坝和春浇工作正在积极进行。
    为了满足农民春耕生产的需要，各地供销合作社正在供应农民农具、籽种、肥料和药剂等生产资料。据不完全统计，全区供销合作社已供应各种大小型农具三万六千多件，耕畜九千三百四十一头，各种农药八十五万斤。河套区、丰镇、布特哈旗等地，还召开了手工业会议，组织农村手工业给农民修制农具。
    在春耕准备工作中，各地同时注意解决受灾户、烈属、军属的生产和生活上的困难。如萨拉齐县共有三十二个重灾乡，群众缺乏籽种、口粮和牲畜的饲草。萨拉齐县领导机关发动群众互助互济解决困难，并及时发放贷款、救济款和调拨粮食，支援农民春耕。首都三十二个工厂企业完成第一季度计划
    【新华社二十八日讯】到三月二十七日为止，首都已有三十二个国营、地方国营、公私合营工厂企业提前完成第一季度国家生产计划。其中包括石景山钢铁厂、石景山发电厂、琉璃河水泥厂、北京人民机器厂、北京市金属结构工厂、丰台铁路运输分局等主要工厂企业。
    这些单位在完成第一季度的国家生产计划中，许多职工学习了王崇伦的首创革新精神。石景山钢铁厂一号高炉工人把流铁水的砂沟砌上耐火砖，使铁水顺畅流通，沟沿上不结铁瘤子，每天多出了八吨多生铁。北京人民机器厂加工车间刘健杰小组工人和技术人员结合，改进卡具，全小组在二月份完成了两个半月的工作量。清河制呢厂计划课长王俊灵提出改进准备车间的生产工序，大大改善了工人的劳动条件，使产量提高了百分之五十三点三。北京市金属结构工厂电焊工人邢汉璋、王宝清创造了“双弧焊接法”，解决了电机不足的关键问题。
