Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The "embargo" and price suppression policies implemented by the United States in the past few years have severely damaged the economies of major rubber-producing countries in Southeast Asia.

    In the British colony of Malaya, many small rubber producers have gone bankrupt because they cannot sustain production under the rubber prices manipulated by the United States. The total annual output of small rubber producers throughout Malaya has decreased from approximately 320,000 tons in 1950 to about 230,000 tons currently. According to the London "Malay Mail," in one state of Malaya alone, 2,000 plantations, mainly owned by small rubber estate owners, were auctioned off by the British colonial authorities in Malaya in 1953 due to their inability to pay taxes.

    The total annual output of large rubber plantations in Malaya has also decreased from over 400,000 tons in 1949 to approximately 340,000 tons currently.

    As rubber prices continued to be greatly suppressed in 1953, Malaya's export trade (of which rubber exports account for about 60 percent annually) continued to decline. The total value of Malaya's export trade in 1953 decreased by about a quarter compared to 1952 and more than half compared to 1951. The trade deficit in 1953 reached more than 300 million Malayan dollars, while Malaya's trade in 1950 and 1951 had surpluses of more than 1 billion dollars.

    Malaya is currently facing the most severe commercial depression since the 1930s. Davis of the Singapore Labor Department said on February 7 that unemployment in Singapore is increasing. Due to trade recession and business closures, thousands of workers in Malayan brick-making, rubber, copra, and glass factories are facing the threat of mass layoffs. Mainly due to the serious impact of falling rubber prices on tax revenues, the 1954 budget deficit of the Federation of Malaya reached 222.2 million Malayan dollars, which is the highest record in Malayan history.

    In Indonesia, the severe economic difficulties caused by the United States' suppression of rubber prices are equally evident. According to Indonesian official figures, from January to November 1953, Indonesia's rubber exports decreased by approximately 8 percent in quantity compared to the same period in 1952, while the revenue from selling rubber decreased by about one-third.

    The Indonesian government has taken import controls and other financial measures to cope with the sharp decline in rubber income, but Indonesia's foreign trade in 1953 still had a deficit of 150 million US dollars. In 1951, when rubber prices initially declined, Indonesia's foreign trade had a surplus of 453 million US dollars.

    In the rubber-producing areas of southern Thailand, many rubber plantations have stopped or reduced production, and a large number of rubber workers have lost their jobs. Rubber export trade accounts for 33 percent of Thailand's total export trade annually. The total value of Thailand's rubber exports in 1953 decreased by 39 percent compared to 1952, and by approximately 58 percent or more compared to 1951.

### 美国几年来推行“禁运”和压价政策  东南亚主要橡胶生产国家面临严重困难

    美国几年来推行“禁运”和压价政策
    东南亚主要橡胶生产国家面临严重困难
      【新华社八日讯】美国在过去几年中实行的“禁运”和压价政策，严重摧残了东南亚主要橡胶生产国家的经济。
    在英国殖民地马来亚，许多橡胶小生产者因为不能在美国所操纵的橡胶价格下维持生产而陷破产。全马来亚橡胶小生产者的全年总产量已经从一九五○年的约三十二万吨下降到目前的二十三万吨左右。据伦敦“马来亚箴言报”报道：仅在马来亚的一个州，一九五三年间就有主要属于小橡胶园所有者拥有的二千块种植地，因无力缴纳赋税而被马来亚英国殖民当局拍卖。
    马来亚大橡胶种植园的全年总产量，也已经由一九四九年的四十万吨以上，下降到目前的三十四万吨左右。
    由于橡胶价格在一九五三年间继续被大大压低，马来亚出口贸易（其中橡胶出口常年约占百分之六十）又继续下降。一九五三年马来亚出口贸易总值，比一九五二年减少了约四分之一，比一九五一年减少了一半以上。一九五三年对外贸易入超达马来亚币三亿多元，而一九五○年和一九五一年马来亚的贸易都出超十亿元以上。
    马来亚目前已经面对着本世纪三十年代以来最严重的商业萧条。新加坡劳工司的戴维斯二月七日说，新加坡的失业正在增加。由于贸易衰退、企业倒闭，马来亚制砖、橡胶、椰干和玻璃等厂坊的数以千计的工人正面临集体解雇的威胁。主要由于橡胶价格的下跌严重影响到税收，马来亚联合邦一九五四年度预算赤字达到马来亚币二亿二千二百万元，这是马来亚有史以来的最高纪录。
    在印度尼西亚，美国压低橡胶价格所造成的严重经济困难也同样明显。据印尼官方的数字，一九五三年一月到十一月间，印尼橡胶出口在数量上约比一九五二年同期减少了百分之八，而售卖橡胶所得减少了约三分之一。
    印尼政府已经采取了入口统制和其他财政措施来应付橡胶收入锐减，但印尼对外贸易一九五三年仍然入超一亿五千万美元。而在橡胶价格初步下降的一九五一年，印尼对外贸易却是出超四亿五千三百万美元的。
    在泰国南部橡胶生产区，许多橡胶园停止或减低了生产，大批橡胶工人失业。橡胶出口贸易常年占泰国整个出口贸易总值达百分之三十三。泰国橡胶出口总值一九五三年比一九五二年减少了百分之三十九，比一九五一年减少了约百分之五十八以上。
