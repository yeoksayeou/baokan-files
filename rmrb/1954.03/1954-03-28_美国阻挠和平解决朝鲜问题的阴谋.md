Title: The American Conspiracy to Obstruct the Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

    The Berlin Conference agreement on holding the Geneva Conference opened a way out of the deadlock created single-handedly by the United States on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, providing a reasonable path for Korea to transition from armistice to lasting peace and national reunification. The vast public in the world and Asian countries unanimously hope that this conference can achieve something, thereby further easing world tensions.

    However, a completely opposite reaction has appeared in the United States. U.S. government officials, members of Congress, and reactionary newspapers have disseminated a large amount of atmosphere asserting that the Geneva Conference would definitely fail, clamoring that the Geneva Conference could not reach any agreement other than maintaining the current deadlock created single-handedly by the United States. Recently, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, openly declared, "There probably won't be peace in Korea." The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Robertson, also frankly admitted that the U.S. diplomatic approach is to keep the Korean issue on the agenda for a long time.

    The attitude of the American ruling group towards the Geneva Conference is consistent with its past policy of obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference. Moreover, the means it is now adopting, like in the past, is to collude with the Syngman Rhee group to carry out sabotage.

    Since the Korean armistice, the Syngman Rhee group has been clamoring against seeking the reunification of Korea through peaceful and democratic means, demanding that the United States support its "northward march" to "unify" Korea by force. After the Berlin Conference, with the support of the United States, this clamor of the Syngman Rhee group has become even more rampant.

    The Syngman Rhee group is particularly annoyed that the Geneva Conference takes the form of consultations with the participation of the five countries of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as other relevant countries. Some members of the American ruling group openly said that the Geneva Conference should be held in accordance with the erroneous resolutions of the UN General Assembly on the form and membership of the Korean political conference. From this, it can also be seen the purpose of their echoing each other.

    A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department actually announced on March 9 that a unilateral agreement reached between the United States and Syngman Rhee last year is still valid, that is, if the conference discussing the Korean issue cannot achieve its intended purpose "ninety days later," the United States and Syngman Rhee "can consider the conference to be over." At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles officially informed the Syngman Rhee group of this "guarantee." Therefore, the Foreign Minister of the Syngman Rhee government, Pyun Yung-tai, said triumphantly on the 23rd, "The most encouraging thing in Mr. Dulles's note is that he confirmed our understanding: if the conference does not yield any results, we will jointly withdraw from the conference and discuss future steps." What kind of "steps" are going to be discussed? Syngman Rhee said on the same day that this is to have the United States "give us (the Syngman Rhee group) air and naval support and provide full weapons and supplies" in order to carry out a "northward march." Subsequently, the Syngman Rhee group made new demands on Dulles, asking the U.S. government to promise to take this "step" after they withdraw from the Geneva Conference.

    According to the so-called "guarantee" given to the Syngman Rhee group by the U.S. State Department, the Geneva Conference should not seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue based on the spirit of equal consultation and on the basis of the Korean people solving their own problems, but can only reach a result that can satisfy their desires within the time limit set by them, according to the unilateral agreement between the United States and the Syngman Rhee group. There can be no other explanation for this except to prove that the American ruling group is colluding with the Syngman Rhee group to jointly resist and undermine the Geneva Conference.

    This is not accidental. The facts show that what the American ruling group cares about is long-term division of Korea and using South Korea as its new adventurous military base. The U.S. Congress hurriedly approved the U.S.-Rhee "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed last August, which is clear proof. According to this treaty, the United States will station troops in South Korea indefinitely, so that the United States can launch another war together with the Syngman Rhee group under the pretext of being "attacked." At the same time, the United States is stepping up the expansion of the Rhee puppet army. On February 23, the Syngman Rhee group established two new infantry divisions, so that the Rhee puppet army has expanded to twenty divisions. Moreover, negotiations between the United States and Rhee on further expanding the Rhee puppet army are still frequent. In the past three weeks, the Syngman Rhee group and the U.S. military have held eleven secret meetings. The Syngman Rhee ambassador to the United States, in a meeting with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, requested that the United States increase the puppet army by another 200,000 men in addition to the existing twenty divisions. When the Syngman Rhee group met with Hull, Briggs, and others, they asked the United States to give them more air force and naval weapons. According to Anderson, commander of the U.S. Fifth Air Force, Washington is considering Syngman Rhee's "request to establish a South Korean Air Force with twelve squadrons, including nine squadrons of Sabre jet fighter-bombers." In order to expand Syngman Rhee's forces, a large number of South Korean air force personnel are being trained in the United States, and the United States is constantly violating the armistice agreement, transporting a large number of disassembled and boxed jet aircraft and various weapons to South Korea.

    All these facts show that the American ruling group is stepping up the creation of obstacles when the upcoming Geneva Conference discusses the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Under the pressure of world public opinion, the heads of the U.S. government, fearing to bear the responsibility for undermining the Geneva Conference, are doing everything possible to shift the responsibility to others in advance. Dulles, in his speech on February 24, actually said that whether the Geneva Conference can resolve the Korean issue depends on whether China is "willing" to do so. However, the fact that the United States obstructed the convening of the Korean political conference cannot be covered up, and the conspiratorial activities of the American ruling group to continue colluding with the Syngman Rhee group to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on the Korean issue cannot escape the condemnation of the world's just public opinion.

### 美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋

    美国阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋胡思升
    柏林会议关于举行日内瓦会议的协议，打开了在和平解决朝鲜问题上由美国一手造成的僵局，提供了使朝鲜从停战转入持久和平及恢复国家的统一的合理途径。全世界和亚洲国家的广大公众一致希望这个会议能有所成就，从而进一步缓和世界的紧张局势。
    但是，在美国出现了截然相反的反应。美国政府官员、国会议员和反动报刊大量地散布了日内瓦会议肯定要失败的空气，叫嚷除了保持目前由美国所一手造成的僵局以外，日内瓦会议不可能达成任何协议。最近美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福公开扬言：“在朝鲜大约是不会有和平的。”美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊也毫不隐讳地承认，美国外交上的做法就是要使朝鲜问题长期留在日程上。
    美国统治集团对待日内瓦会议的这种态度，和它过去阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开的政策是一致的。而且，它现在所采取的手段，也像过去那样，勾结李承晚集团来进行破坏。
    李承晚集团在朝鲜停战后一直叫嚣反对用和平民主方式谋求恢复朝鲜的统一，要求美国支持它
  “向北进军”，用武力“统一”朝鲜。而在柏林会议后，在美国的支持下，李承晚集团的这种叫嚣更加猖狂了。
    李承晚集团对于日内瓦会议是采取在中苏美英法五国及其他有关国家参加下举行协商的会议形式，特别表示恼怒。而美国统治集团也还有人公然说日内瓦会议是应该根据联合国大会关于朝鲜政治会议的形式和成员问题所作的错误决议来举行的会议。从这里也可以看出他们之间的一唱一和的目的所在了。
    美国国务院发言人在三月九日居然宣布说：美国和李承晚去年达成的一项片面协议仍然有效，即讨论朝鲜问题的会议如果在举行“九十天后”不能达到它们所预定的目的，美国和李承晚“就可以认为会议已告结束”。同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯并正式照会李承晚集团提出这种“保证”。于是，李承晚政府的外务部长官卞荣泰在二十三日得意忘形地说：“杜勒斯先生的照会中最令人鼓舞的是：他证实了我们的理解：如果会议得不到什么结果，我们将共同退出会议并且讨论今后的步骤。”将要讨论什么样的“步骤”呢？李承晚在同一天说，这就是要美国“给予我们（李承晚集团）空军和海军的支持，并给予充分的武器和供应品”，以便实行“向北进军”。接着李承晚集团就向杜勒斯提出了新的要求，要美国政府许诺在他们退出日内瓦会议后采取这个“步骤”。
    依照美国国务院给李承晚集团的这个所谓“保证”，日内瓦会议似乎就不应根据平等协商的精神及在由朝鲜人民自己解决自己问题的基础上来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，而只能根据美国和李承晚集团的片面协议，在他们规定的时限来得出能够满足他们的欲望的结果。这除了证明美国统治集团是要勾结李承晚集团来一起抵制和破坏日内瓦会议以外，是不可能有别的解释的。
    这不是偶然的。事实表明，美国统治集团所关心的是要长期分裂朝鲜，并把南朝鲜作为它的新的冒险的军事基地。美国国会急忙批准去年八月签订的美李“共同防御条约”，就是明证。根据这个条约，美国将无限期驻兵南朝鲜，这样美国就可以在所谓受到“攻击”的借口之下再度和李承晚集团一道发动战争。同时，美国正在加紧扩充李伪军。二月二十三日，李承晚集团成立了两个新的步兵师，这样，李伪军已扩大到了二十个师。而且，美李之间关于进一步扩充李伪军的谈判仍在频繁进行。在过去三个星期中，李承晚集团和美国军方就举行了十一次秘密会议。李承晚驻美大使在和美国助理国务卿罗伯逊会谈时，要求除了现有的二十师之外，由美国再把伪军增加二十万人。李承晚集团在与赫尔、布里格斯等会谈时，又要求美国给它更多的空军武器和海军武器。据美国第五航空队司令安德逊透露，华盛顿正在考虑李承晚提出的“要求成立一支拥有十二个中队的韩国空军，其中包括九个中队的佩刀式喷气战斗轰炸机”的计划。为了扩充李承晚的兵力，大批南朝鲜的空军人员正在美国受训，而且美国还不断违反停战协定，把大批的拆散装箱的喷气式飞机和各种武器源源运入南朝鲜。
    这一切的事实，都说明了美国统治集团正在加紧为即将举行的日内瓦会议在讨论和平解决朝鲜问题时制造重重的障碍。美国政府的首脑人物在世界舆论的压力下，害怕承担破坏日内瓦会议的责任，就千方百计地企图事先把责任转嫁到别人身上。杜勒斯在他二月二十四日的演说中竟然把日内瓦会议能否解决朝鲜问题说成是取决于中国“愿意”与否。但是，美国阻挠朝鲜政治会议召开的事实是掩盖不住的，美国统治集团继续勾结李承晚集团阻挠日内瓦会议达成关于朝鲜问题的协议的阴谋活动，是无法逃避世界公正舆论的谴责的。
