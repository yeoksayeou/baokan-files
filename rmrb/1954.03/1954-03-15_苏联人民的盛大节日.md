    Grand Festival of the Soviet People
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    March 14th was a festive day for all the Soviet people to elect deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.
    For the past few days, Moscow has been bidding farewell to winter and welcoming spring. The ice and snow on the roofs and roadsides have begun to melt, and the breeze in the streets and alleys has lost its chill. Buildings everywhere are adorned with festive red decorations, with national flags and bright red banners bearing slogans such as "Every voter participates in the election!" and "Vote for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party people's alliance!"
    Usually on Sunday mornings at seven or eight o'clock, there are few cars and people on the streets of Moscow. But today is different. Trolleybuses, trams, and buses have been busy since five o'clock, and the subway has been running since six o'clock. Just as the east began to turn white, voters were already heading in groups to the polling stations set up near their residences in clubs, cultural palaces, schools, and public places.
    The Kremlin clock struck six times clearly. The election committees of about 1,500 polling stations in the eighteen electoral districts of Moscow had already inspected and sealed the ballot boxes, and invited voters to vote.
    I arrived at the first polling station in the Leningrad electoral district of Moscow. The candidates there were Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Malenkov (for the Union Council), and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Defense, Bulganin (for the National Council). Voters, according to the first letter of their names, presented their citizenship certificates and received one white and one blue ballot. The white ballot had the name of the candidate Malenkov and the electoral unit printed on it. The blue ballot had the name of the candidate Bulganin and the electoral unit printed on it. Inside the polling station, there were five voting booths. Each booth had a curtain and was furnished with tables and chairs. Voters could select their representatives in the booth without interference from others; no one had the right to enter. If a voter approved of the candidate, they would not change the printed ballot. If they did not approve, they had the right to cross out the candidate's name and fill in the name of someone they approved of. After making their selection, the voters themselves put the ballots into the ballot box. At the first polling station, two ballot boxes were placed in front of portraits of Lenin and Stalin. Men and women voters, all over the age of eighteen, came one after another to vote solemnly, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, level of education, social origin, or financial status. Some voters who had come to Moscow from Kiev, Saratov, and other places for business presented certificates and voted there.
    Afterwards, I went to the nineteenth polling station in the Molotov electoral district of Moscow. The candidates there were First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Molotov (for the Union Council), and Minister of Defense, Bulganin (for the National Council). By eight o'clock, 25 percent of the voters had already voted.
    In the Kirov electoral district, workers at the Red Hill Wool Textile Factory overproduced more than 38,000 meters of wool fabric before the election, and elected Chutkikh, the founder of the advanced product election movement. In the October electoral district, people voted to elect Bykov, the founder of the high-speed metal cutting method. In the Soviet electoral district, people elected Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In the Sverdlovsk electoral district, people elected the outstanding actress Tarasova. In the Frunze electoral district, people elected the school principal Martyanyanova. The voters in the eighteen electoral districts of Moscow were to elect eighteen deputies to the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and jointly elect one deputy to the National Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. These representatives were all nominated by social organizations and laborers, and were all candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party people's alliance.
    In Moscow, in the Soviet Union, people exercised their rights as stipulated in the Constitution, and carried out universal, equal, direct, and secret elections. At the polling stations in Moscow, whether it was a young person just turned eighteen, an old person leaning on a cane, or a woman carrying a child, they were all so joyful and solemn when they put their ballots into the ballot box in front of the Soviet national emblem and the portraits of Lenin and Stalin. From the eyes shining on their simple faces, one could see that they were not only voting to trust the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance, but also voting to support the wise domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet Communist Party and government, a policy that takes the interests of the Soviet people and the interests of all progressive mankind as the highest criterion. "All of us, like one person, vote wholeheartedly for the Party, for the happiness of the people," said Gimosina, the trade union group leader of the Stalin Automobile Factory, expressing what is in the hearts of the Soviet people today.
    At the polling stations, many people asked me about the election situation in our country. They were all happy that the Chinese people had begun to have truly democratic elections. They said that only a truly people's regime can have truly democratic elections. (2:00 PM, March 14th)

### 苏联人民的盛大节日

    苏联人民的盛大节日
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    三月十四日是全苏联人民选举苏联最高苏维埃代表的节日。
    几天来莫斯科在送走冬天和迎接春天。屋顶路旁的冰雪开始融化，街头巷口的微风失去寒意。各处建筑物披上了节日的红装，插着国旗，挂着鲜耀的红布标语：“每个选民参加选举去！”“投共产党与非党人民联盟的候选人的票！”
    往常星期天早晨七八点钟，莫斯科街道上还是车少人稀。今天可不同。无轨电车、电车、公共汽车从五点钟，地下电车从六点钟就忙碌起来了。东方才发白，选民们已经成群结队地向设在住处附近的俱乐部、文化宫、学校和公共场所的选举站出发了。
    克里姆林宫的钟清彻地敲打了六下。莫斯科市十八个选区约一千五百个选举站的选举委员会已经检验过和封起投票箱，请选民投票了。
    我到了莫斯科市列宁格勒选举区的第一选举站。那里的候选人是苏联部长会议主席马林科夫（联盟院）和苏联部长会议第一副主席、国防部长布尔加宁（民族院）。选民按自己姓名的头一个字母，凭着公民证，向选举委员会的工作人员领取了一白一蓝的选举票。白票上印着候选人马林科夫的姓名和选举的单位。蓝票上印着候选人布尔加宁的姓名和选举的单位。选举站里面设着五个选举室。室室垂着门帘，放着桌椅。选民到室里不受外人干涉地选定自己的代表，别人没有权进去。选民如果赞成候选人，就不改动已印好的选票，如果不赞成，有权画掉候选人的姓名和填上自己认可的人名。选定后，选民自己把选票投到投票箱里去。第一选举站在列宁斯大林像面前摆着两个投票箱。年满十八岁的男女选民陆续前来庄严地投票，不问他们的族别、信仰、文化程度、社会出身和财产状况。有些从基辅、萨拉托夫等地因事到莫斯科来的选民，拿着证书到那里投了票。
    随后我到了莫斯科市莫洛托夫选区的第十九选举站。那里的候选人是苏联部长会议第一副主席、外交部长莫洛托夫（联盟院）和国防部长布尔加宁（民族院）。八点钟，已有百分之二十五的选民投了票。
    在基洛夫选举区，红岗毛纺厂工人们在选举日前超额增产了三万八千多公尺毛布，选举优等产品运动创始人楚特基赫。在十月选区的人们投票选举金属高速切削法创始人比科夫。在苏维埃选区人们在选举苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫。在斯维德洛夫斯克选区人们在选举优秀女演员塔拉索娃。在伏龙芝选区人们在选举中学校长马尔佳扬诺娃。莫斯科市十八个选举区的选民要分别选举十八个代表到苏联最高苏维埃的联盟院去，共同选举一个代表到苏联最高苏维埃的民族院去。这些代表都是由社会团体和劳动者提出的，都是共产党与非党人民联盟的候选人。
    在莫斯科，在苏联，人民根据宪法所规定的权利，进行普遍、平等，直接和秘密的选举。在莫斯科各个选举站上，不论是刚满十八岁的青年人，还是扶杖而来的老年人，还是携提着小孩的妇女，当他们在苏联国徽和列宁斯大林像面前，把自己的选票投进票箱口的时刻，都是那样喜悦而庄严。从他们朴素脸孔上闪耀着的眼光中，人们可以看出，他们不仅仅在投票信任共产党与非党联盟的候选人，而且在投票拥护苏联共产党和政府的英明的内外政策，这个政策是以苏联人民的利益和整个进步人类的利益为最高准绳的。“我们所有的人，像一个人一样，为党，为人民的幸福，全心全意地投票”，——斯大林汽车制造厂工会小组长吉莫施娜说出苏联人民今天心坎里的话。
    在选举站上，不少人们向我问起我国进行选举的情形。他们一致以中国人民开始有真正民主的选举而高兴。他们表示，只有真正人民的政权，才能有真正民主的选举。　（三月十四日十四点）
