The friendship and unity forged with blood between the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has been further consolidated. Kim Ung-gi said: After the armistice, the Korean people warmly responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and rose up to rapidly restore and develop the post-war people's economy, so as to strengthen our country's political, economic, and military power, and complete the task of struggle for the peaceful unification and independence of our motherland. The officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will continue to maintain revolutionary vigilance, and will stand more vigilantly at their posts in order to defend the peaceful labor achievements of our people.
