Local People's Procuratorates Actively Participate in Grain Purchase and Supply Work
Investigate and Handle Profiteers and Counter-Revolutionaries Who Sabotage Grain Policy

    During the process of the state implementing planned purchase and supply of grain, people's procuratorates at all levels actively cooperated with relevant departments to investigate and handle a batch of speculative profiteers and counter-revolutionaries who seriously sabotaged the state's grain policy. Through public prosecution of typical cases, they expanded the publicity and education of policies and laws, which played a significant role in ensuring the completion of the grain planned purchase tasks and the normal progress of grain planned supply work.
    After the State Council of the Central People's Government decided to implement planned purchase and supply of grain, the Supreme People's Procuratorate immediately issued instructions requiring people's procuratorates at all levels to fully recognize the great significance of guaranteeing the implementation of this national policy, and to quickly assign a certain number of cadres to participate in the grain struggle. Subsequently, the Supreme People's Procuratorate also dispatched work inspection teams to regions such as Southwest, Central-South, and Northeast China to assist in carrying out inspection work during the grain struggle. It also convened a meeting of office directors of major sub-bureaus to report and discuss the situation and problems in grain work, and to study the policies related to grain issues and the working methods for carrying out procuratorial business. Since then, general cadres of people's procuratorates in various regions have taken the initiative to actively participate in the grain struggle, effectively cracking down on speculative profiteers and counter-revolutionaries who conspire to create chaos by taking advantage of the situation, seriously undermining the grain policy.
    In the process of investigating the above-mentioned illegal and criminal cases, people's procuratorates in various regions, in order to thoroughly expose the crimes of speculative profiteers and counter-revolutionaries, publicized and explained to the masses the people's government's policies on grain issues in order to mobilize the masses to supervise and report speculative profiteers and various bad elements, systematically classified cases, distinguished the nature of the cases, selected major typical cases, and promptly filed public prosecutions with the people's courts for public trials or public pronouncements of judgments. For example, Yue Wen, a profiteer from Yiheheng Inn in Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province, consistently engaged in grain speculation across different industries. From January to November of last year, he resold more than 770,000 jin of grain, purchased and sold more than 480,000 jin of various oil materials, and 1.25 million jin of oil cakes. After the implementation of planned purchase and supply of grain, he illegally purchased and sold more than 120,000 jin of grain. After the Jiexiu County People's Procuratorate inspected and arrested this incorrigible profiteer, the local people unanimously supported it. This powerfully cracked down on the speculative activities of profiteers. The Leshan County People's Procuratorate in Sichuan Province investigated a case of organized theft of public grain and, in coordination with relevant authorities, held a mass rally and publicly sentenced the mastermind, Zhang Shaoming, to death with immediate execution. After that, the masses in various townships voluntarily came forward to protect the grain, and those who had stolen public grain confessed one after another, thus exposing and handling collective theft of public grain by Xu Bosheng and others. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate held an exhibition of incriminating photos of grain profiteers, focusing on exposing the evidence of illegal activities of grain profiteers verified by the procuratorate, combined with publicizing the general line and the national grain policy, and pointed out the future path for private grain industrial and commercial operators. From December 18, 1953, to January 15 of this year, in 29 days, a total of more than 125,000 people visited the exhibition. During the exhibition, the bureau also organized various small-scale discussion meetings for the audience. All of these have powerfully guaranteed and promoted the smooth progress of grain purchase and supply work.
    While investigating the sabotage activities of grain profiteers and counter-revolutionaries, people's procuratorates in various regions also closely monitored the correct implementation of grain policies. Many local people's procuratorates actively and focusedly investigated and studied the illegal and undisciplined phenomena that hindered the smooth progress of grain purchase work, proposed solutions, reported them to the Party and government leading organs, and dealt with them in a timely manner. For example, the Xiangyang County People's Procuratorate in Hubei Province promptly inspected the situation in Oumiao District, where slogans were raised indiscriminately in the implementation of the grain policy, and illegal and undisciplined activities such as indiscriminate arrests and detentions occurred. It made a substantive and analytical report to the Party and government leading organs, which was seriously dealt with after being approved by the Party and government leading organs. After the report was forwarded to the Provincial Party Committee by the Hubei Provincial People's Procuratorate, it was successively transmitted by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, the Central-South Bureau, and the Central Committee to Party committees at all levels, ordering Party and government leading organs at all levels to strictly prevent the occurrence of similar illegal phenomena.
    At present, people's procuratorial organs at all levels are conscientiously summarizing the work experience of the previous period, and continue to pay attention to discovering and inspecting criminal acts of corruption, theft, and destruction of state grain, as well as dereliction of duty that seriously damages grain; paying attention to inspecting the illegal acts of a small number of profiteers who continue to undermine grain policies and in processing and consignment sales, in order to consolidate the achievements that the state has already made in grain work.

    各地人民检察机关积极参加粮食收购和供应工作
    检查处理破坏粮食政策的奸商和反革命分子
    在国家实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的过程中，各级人民检察署曾积极地配合有关部门检查处理了一批严重破坏国家粮食政策的投机奸商和反革命分子，并通过对典型案件的公诉，扩大了政策法令的宣传教育，对于保障粮食计划收购任务的完成和粮食计划供应工作的正常进行起了很大作用。
    在中央人民政府政务院决定实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应以后，最高人民检察署立即发出指示，要求各级人民检察署充分认识保障国家这一政策贯彻执行的重大意义，迅速抽调一定数量的干部参加粮食斗争。其后最高人民检察署又派出视察工作组，分赴西南、中南和东北等地区，协助开展粮食斗争中的检查工作。还召开各大区分署办公室主任会议，汇报和讨论了粮食工作的情况和问题，研究了有关粮食问题的政策以及开展检察业务的工作方法。此后，各地人民检察署一般干部都主动积极地参加粮食斗争，有效地打击了严重破坏粮食政策的投机奸商和阴谋乘机制造纷乱的反革命分子。
    各地人民检察署在检查上述违法犯罪案件中，为了彻底揭发投机奸商和反革命分子的罪行，向群众宣传和交代人民政府关于粮食问题的政策，以动员群众监督和检举投机奸商和各种坏分子，曾经有计划地将案件分类排队，区别案件的性质，选择重大的典型案件，及时向人民法院提起公诉，由人民法院公开审判或公开宣判。例如山西介休县义和亨旅店的奸商岳文，一贯地跨行跨业，从事粮食投机活动，在去年一月到十一月间就倒卖了粮食七十七万多斤，购销各种油料四十八万多斤、油饼一百二十五万多斤。在实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应以后，还非法购销粮食达十二万多斤。介休县人民检察署检查逮捕了这个屡教不改的奸商以后，当地人民无不热烈拥护。这就有力地打击了奸商的投机活动。四川省乐山县人民检察署检查了有组织地盗窃公粮的案件，配合有关机关召开群众大会，大张旗鼓地公开判处主谋犯张少明死刑立即执行后，各乡群众自动起来护粮，曾经偷盗过公粮的人也纷纷坦白，因而又揭发处理了许伯生等人集体盗窃公粮等事件。广州市人民检察署举办了粮食奸商罪证图片展览，以揭发经该署检察属实的粮食奸商违法活动的罪证为中心，结合宣传总路线及国家粮食政策，指出私营粮食工商业者今后的出路。从一九五三年十二月十八日至今年一月十五日止，二十九天内前往参观的群众共十二万五千多人。在展览期间，该署还组织观众举行了各种小型座谈会。所有这些，均有力地保证和推动了粮食的收购和供应工作的顺利进行。
    各地人民检察署在检查粮食奸商和反革命分子破坏活动的同时，还密切地注意监督粮食政策的正确贯彻执行。许多地方的人民检察署都积极地有重点地调查研究了妨碍粮食收购工作顺利进行的违法乱纪现象，提出克服办法，报告党政领导机关，及时作了处理。如湖北省襄阳县人民检察署及时地检查了欧庙区在贯彻执行粮食政策中乱提口号并发生乱捕乱押等违法乱纪的情况，向党政领导机关作了有内容有分析的报告，经党政领导机关批准后作了严肃的处理。该报告经湖北省人民检察署转报省委后，曾先后由湖北省委、中南局和中央批转各级党委，责成各级党政领导机关严防类似违法现象的发生。
    现在，各级人民检察机关正认真总结前一段时期的工作经验，并继续注意发现和检查贪污、盗窃、破坏国家粮食的犯罪行为以及严重损坏粮食的失职行为；注意检查继续破坏粮食政策的少数奸商以及在加工、代销中的不法行为，以巩固国家在粮食工作方面已经取得的成绩。（最高人民检察署通讯小组）
