Hebei Province, in order to develop the rural socialist economy and strengthen agricultural construction, has now established two state-owned agricultural machine tractor stations in Raoyang and Jin County, and plans to establish one hundred state-owned tractor stations throughout the province within five years.

    The state-owned Hebei No. 1 Agricultural Machine Tractor Station was established on December 27th of last year in Wugong Village, Raoyang County. The station now has one 45-horsepower "Nazi" tractor and two 12-horsepower small tractors, as well as agricultural implements such as five-bottom plows, forty-one disc harrows, thirty-two disc plows, and twenty-four row seeders. This year, the tractor station will mainly focus on cultivating the land of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative. With the help of the tractor station, the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative will reap even greater harvests this year. The state-owned Hebei No. 2 Tractor Station was established in Zhoujiazhuang, Jin County, on February 13th of this year. February 13th was also the day when the ten agricultural production cooperatives of Zhoujiazhuang, comprising four hundred and twenty-five peasant households, merged to form the "Jin County Zhoujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative," holding a grand celebration. From now on, the farmers of Zhoujiazhuang will use tractors to cultivate their own land.

    Last year, in order to establish tractor stations in a planned manner, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hebei Provincial People's Government dispatched a large number of surveying and design personnel to Raoyang, Ninghe, Jin County, and the Junliangcheng Farm, among other places with better conditions, to conduct surveying and mapping, in order to determine the locations for establishing tractor stations and to adjust the drainage and irrigation systems for paddy fields. After surveying by the survey team, in addition to the tractor stations already established in Wugong Village in Raoyang and Zhoujiazhuang in Jin County, the province also plans to establish a tractor station in the area of the Yang Zhenru agricultural production cooperatives, model worker of Ninghe County, and plans to reclaim more than 200,000 mu of wasteland near Junliangcheng. According to the existing plans, Hebei Province will establish one hundred state-owned tractor stations within five years.

    河北省建立两个农业机器拖拉机站
    全省在五年内准备建立一百个拖拉机站
    河北省为了发展农村社会主义经济和加强农业建设，现已在饶阳、晋县建立了两个国营农业机器拖拉机站，并计划全省在五年内建立一百个国营农业拖拉机站。
    国营河北第一农业机器拖拉机站是去年十二月二十七日在饶阳县五公村成立的。该站现已有四十五匹马力的“纳齐”拖拉机一部和十二匹马力的小型拖拉机二部，还有五铧犁、四十一片圆盘耙、三十二片圆盘犁、二十四行播种机等农具。这个拖拉机站今年主要是以耕种耿长锁农业生产合作社的土地为主。耿长锁农业生产合作社今年有了拖拉机站的帮助，将要获得更大的丰收。国营河北第二拖拉机站于今年二月十三日在晋县周家庄成立，二月十三日又是周家庄十个农业生产合作社四百二十五户农民归并成立“晋县周家庄农业生产合作社”举行隆重庆祝大会的一天。从此周家庄的农民将要用拖拉机来耕作自己的土地了。
    去年河北省人民政府农林厅为了有计划的建立拖拉机站，曾抽派了大批调查测量设计人员，分赴条件较好的饶阳、宁河、晋县及军粮城农场等处进行测绘设计，以便确定建立拖拉机站的地点和调整稻田排水灌溉系统等工作。经过勘测队的勘测后，该省除了现已在饶阳五公村和晋县周家庄建立拖拉机站外，还准备在宁河县劳动模范杨振儒等农业生产合作社一带建立拖拉机站，并规划机垦军粮城附近的二十多万亩荒地。根据现有的规划设计，河北省在五年内将要建立一百个国营拖拉机站。
