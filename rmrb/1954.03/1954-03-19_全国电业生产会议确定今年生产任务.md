The National Electricity Production Conference, organized by the Electricity Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, was held from February 26th to March 6th. The conference summarized the work experience of 1953 and arranged the production tasks for this year.

    The Electricity Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry requires that this year's power generation increase by 14.63% compared to 1953, and the electricity sales increase by 15.01%. In terms of various economic quotas, coal consumption, plant power consumption rate, line loss rate, and production costs are all required to be lower than in 1953, while equipment utilization rate and labor productivity are required to be improved. In order to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of tasks, the conference believes that: it is necessary to strengthen technical management, continue to implement the "Technical Management Regulations for the Power Industry" and regular comprehensive planned maintenance; it is necessary to implement the responsibility system and adjust organizational structures, as well as actively tap the potential of the electricity industry and conduct in-service cadre and worker training in a planned manner. Regarding the plant director responsibility system and the chief engineer's technical responsibility system, after instructions from Minister Chen Yu of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and others, everyone realized that this is the principle of socialist enterprise management and must be earnestly implemented. Minister Chen Yu especially requested that all electricity employees should strive to create conditions to basically eliminate responsibility accidents, and specifically proposed that certain accidents should be eliminated in certain workshops. He also instructed the Electricity Administration Bureau to conduct regular inspections to ensure that accidents do not occur due to poor maintenance quality after major equipment overhauls.

    Director Cheng Mingsheng of the Electricity Administration Bureau, in his concluding report at the conference, requested that everyone must conscientiously implement Minister Chen's specific instructions on safety work, and emphasized that in the future, technical management issues should be given great importance. In particular, it is necessary to strictly guard against the growth of arrogance and complacency, establish an overall concept, and exert collective strength to complete the glorious tasks of 1954.

    At the end of the conference, a silver shield engraved with the words "Good Teacher and Helpful Friend" was presented to the Soviet electricity expert group who have been enthusiastically and selflessly helping us, to express our heartfelt gratitude.

    全国电业生产会议确定今年生产任务
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局于二月二十六至三月六日召开了全国电业生产会议，总结了一九五三年工作经验并布置了今年生产任务。
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局要求今年发电量比一九五三年提高百分之十四点六三，售电量提高百分之十五点零一。在各项经济定额方面，煤耗、厂用电率、线路损失率和生产成本都要求比一九五三年降低，而设备利用率和劳动生产率都要求有所提高。为保证完成和超额完成任务，会议认为：必须加强技术管理、继续贯彻“电力工业技术管理法规”和定期的全面计划检修；必须贯彻责任制并调整组织机构，以及积极发挥电业潜力和有计划地进行在职干部和工人培养训练等工作。对于厂长负责制和总工程师的技术责任制，经过中央燃料工业部陈郁部长等指示后，大家都认识到这是社会主义企业管理的原则，必须认真执行。陈郁部长特别要求全体电业职工应努力创造条件，做到基本上消灭责任事故，并具体提出在某种车间要消灭某些事故，同时指示电业管理总局应经常检查，保证设备大检修后不因检修质量不好而发生事故。
    电业管理总局程明升局长在作会议总结报告时，要求大家必须认真贯彻陈部长对安全工作的具体指示，并强调今后应十分重视技术管理问题，特别要严防骄傲自满情绪的滋长，树立整体观念，发挥集体力量，来完成一九五四年的光荣任务。
    会议最后赠送给热情无私地帮助我们的苏联电业专家组刻有“良师益友”字样的银盾一个，以表示衷心的感谢。
