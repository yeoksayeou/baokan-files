    The first draft constitution of the Chinese people has been published by the Central People's Government Committee and will be widely discussed among the people nationwide.
    A constitution, a truly people's constitution, is not easily obtained; it is the result of the Chinese people's long revolutionary struggle and the bloodshed and sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people achieved a great victory in the democratic revolution, and after the liberation of the whole country, they also achieved victories in land reform, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, various social reforms, economic recovery, and construction. Only then could the first truly democratic constitution be produced. Therefore, I feel boundless joy and excitement about the publication of the draft constitution.
    This draft constitution is a summary of the historical experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. What is the most important experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle? Chairman Mao said long ago in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Follow the path of the Russians—that is the conclusion." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The only path is through a people's republic led by the working class"... "Through the people's republic to reach socialism and communism, to reach the elimination of classes and the Great Harmony of the world." This is the only possible way out, and there is no other.
    The experience of the People's Republic of China in the five years since its founding fully proves that the path of going to socialism and communism through the people's republic is the only correct and only possible one. The draft constitution affirms that the People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants, that all power belongs to the people, that the system of people's congresses is implemented, that all nationalities within the country are equal, and that citizens enjoy various basic rights. At the same time, the constitution also stipulates that in the future our country will be able to eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. Therefore, it also shows that our country's constitution belongs to the socialist type, the same as the constitutions of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Following the path of the Russians is entirely in line with the interests and demands of the people throughout the country.
    Our draft constitution is full of the spirit of combining principle and flexibility. The draft constitution affirms the principles of democracy and socialism, and at the same time reflects the characteristics of the historical period of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society. It stipulates that the state-owned economy under ownership by the whole people is the leading force in the entire national economy and the material basis for realizing socialist transformation, and at the same time stipulates that the state protects the ownership of the means of production and other property ownership of farmers, handicraftsmen, other individual laborers, and capitalists in accordance with the law, gradually changes the ownership of individual laborers into socialist collective ownership, and gradually replaces capitalist ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people. The draft constitution correctly reflects the importance of the working class and the Communist Party in leading the political life of the country, and at the same time clearly points out that the people's democratic united front, led by the Chinese Communist Party and composed of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations, not only played a major role in the great liberation struggle, but will also continue to play its role in completing the country's general tasks and opposing enemies at home and abroad in the future.
    In terms of ethnic relations, foreign relations, state organs, and citizens' rights and obligations, the draft constitution correctly and appropriately combines principle and flexibility. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and guarantee the achievements of the people's revolution, the draft constitution devotes a separate section to the courts and procuratorial organs, and includes the basic principles of court organization and work such as the jury system, public trial, the right of the accused to defense, the right to conduct litigation in their own national language, and the independent conduct of trials by the people's courts, which are subject only to the law, into the constitution. This is of great significance for ensuring the correctness of judgments, ensuring that every citizen can fully exercise their democratic litigation rights, and for the great educational effect on the people.
    The constitution and the law are part of the superstructure, but the superstructure is by no means merely a passive reflection of the base; it must also play an active and dynamic role on the base. Stalin taught us that "once the superstructure appears, it becomes a tremendous positive force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its base, and taking all measures to help the new system destroy and eliminate the old base and old classes." Therefore, the constitution and laws in the transition period are of particularly important significance, not only to actively destroy and eliminate the old foundation, but also to serve the consolidation and development of the new foundation and new system. The greatest task of our country's constitution is to consolidate the achievements of the revolution and promote the formation and development of the socialist economic base. Therefore, from the perspective of a legal worker, strengthening the people's democratic legal system, universally raising the people's patriotic and law-abiding ideological education, so that the constitution and the law can be implemented to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and protect socialist economic construction, is of particular importance.
    The promulgation of the draft constitution and the formulation of the constitution will give great encouragement to the people of the whole country and the people of the world. The draft constitution reflects the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people, and it will be the first constitution formulated by the people themselves. After it is formulated and promulgated, it will certainly be supported and implemented by the people of the whole country. The draft constitution shows that our country is unswervingly striving for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress, which will also have a huge impact on the struggle of people all over the world for peace and democracy.
    The People's Republic of China, which has been established for less than five years, is now, as a major country, carrying out a just struggle in international affairs to strive for peace in Asia and to ease international tensions, further enhancing our country's prestige among peace-loving people all over the world. At this time, our country has promulgated a draft of a new peaceful and democratic constitution, and launched a discussion among all the people, which will cheer and encourage all oppressed and enslaved people all over the world, and at the same time make the imperialist reactionary groups retreat in fear. For this, I cheer:
    Long live the People's Republic of China！
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party！
    Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

### 为宪法草案的公布而欢呼

    为宪法草案的公布而欢呼
    中央人民政府最高人民法院院长  沈钧儒
    中国人民的第一个宪法草案已经由中央人民政府委员会公布，将在全国人民中间展开广泛的讨论。
    宪法，真正人民的宪法，决不是容易得来的，它是中国人民长期革命斗争和革命先烈流血牺牲所换来的。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，取得民主革命的伟大胜利，并且在全国解放以后，又取得了土地改革、抗美援朝、各项社会改革、经济恢复和建设工作的胜利，这样才能产生第一个真正民主的宪法。因此我对于宪法草案的公布感到无限的欢悦和兴奋。
    这个宪法草案是中国人民革命斗争历史的经验总结。中国人民革命斗争最主要的经验是什么呢？毛主席在“论人民民主专政”里早就说过：“走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”毛主席又指出：“唯一的路是经过工人阶级领导的人民共和国”“经过人民共和国到达社会主义和共产主义，到达阶级的消灭和世界的大同。”这是唯一可能的出路，此外便没有出路。
    中华人民共和国建国五年以来的经验，充分证明了经过人民共和国走向社会主义和共产主义的道路是唯一正确的，也是唯一可能的。宪法草案肯定了中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，一切权力属于人民，实行人民代表大会制，国内各民族一律平等，公民享有各种基本权利。同时宪法也规定了今后我国能够通过和平的道路，消灭剥削，消灭贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。因此也就说明了我国宪法是与苏联及各人民民主国家的宪法同属于社会主义类型的。走俄国人的路，这是和全国人民的利益和要求完全相符合的。
    我们的宪法草案充满原则性和灵活性相结合的精神。宪法草案肯定了民主主义和社会主义的原则，同时又反映了我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的历史时期的特点。它规定了全民所有制的国营经济是整个国民经济中的领导力量和实现社会主义改造的物质基础，同时也规定了国家依照法律，分别保护农民、手工业者、其他个体劳动者以及资本家的生产资料所有权和其他财产所有权，逐步改变个体劳动者的所有制为社会主义的集体所有制，并逐步用社会主义的全民所有制代替资本主义所有制。宪法草案正确地反映了工人阶级和共产党领导国家政治生活的重要性，同时又明确地指出，以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的人民民主统一战线，不仅在伟大的解放斗争中曾经起了重大的作用，在今后完成国家总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，还将继续发挥它的作用。
    在民族关系、对外关系，国家机构和公民权利义务各方面，宪法草案都正确地、恰当地使原则性和灵活性结合起来。为了巩固人民民主专政，保障人民革命胜利的成果，宪法草案将法院和检察机关专立一节，并把陪审制度、公开审判、被告辩护权、用本民族语言进行诉讼的权利、人民法院独立进行审判，只服从法律等法院组织和工作的基本原则，列入宪法之内，对于保证判决的正确性，保证每一个公民都可能充分运用自己的民主诉讼权利以及对人民的巨大教育作用，都具有重大的意义。
    宪法和法律是上层建筑的一部分，但是上层建筑决不只是消极地反映基础，它还要对基础起积极的能动的作用。斯大林教导我们说：“上层建筑一出现后，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固，采取一切办法帮助新制度来摧毁和消灭旧基础与旧阶级。”因此在过渡时期的宪法和法律具有特别重要的意义，不但要积极地摧毁和消灭旧基础，而且还要为巩固和发展新基础新制度而服务。我国宪法最大的任务，也就是巩固革命胜利成果，促进社会主义经济基础的形成与发展。因此加强人民民主法制，普遍提高人民群众爱国守法的思想教育，使宪法和法律能够贯彻执行，以巩固人民民主专政，保护社会主义经济建设，从一个法律工作者看来，是具有特别重要意义的。
    宪法草案的公布和宪法的制定，将给全国人民以及全世界人民以莫大的鼓舞。宪法草案反映了广大人民的共同愿望，它将是人民自己所制定的第一个宪法。在制定公布之后，一定可以得到全国人民的拥护和贯彻执行。在宪法草案中所显示的我国坚定不移地为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力的方针，对于全世界人民争取和平民主的斗争，也将发生巨大的影响。
    诞生还不到五年的中华人民共和国，现在已以大国的地位，在国际事务中，为争取亚洲和平和缓和国际紧张局势而进行正义的斗争，更提高了我国在全世界爱好和平的人民中间的威望。正在这一时期，我国公布了和平民主的新宪法草案，在全体人民中展开了讨论，这将使全世界一切被压迫被奴役的人民为之欢欣鼓舞，同时也使帝国主义反动集团闻而却步。为此我欢呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
