    Hubei Province is adopting the advanced Soviet experience of reservoir fish farming. From July of last year to the present, more than 7.88 million fish fry have been released into 37 large and medium-sized reservoirs. The area of reservoirs already used for fish farming accounts for about 70% of the total area of existing large and medium-sized reservoirs in the province. The largest of these fish fry have already grown to one or two *jin* in weight. Currently, it is the season for releasing fish fry, and various parts of Hubei Province are continuing to expand the area of large and medium-sized reservoirs for fish farming. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the area of large and medium-sized reservoirs stocked with fish fry throughout the province will expand to about 90%, with the number of fish released reaching more than 17.8 million. Assuming a survival rate of 50% and an annual growth of one *jin* per fish, the annual output of fresh fish could reach more than 8.9 million *jin*. The largest reservoir in the province, the Shilong Guojiang Reservoir, has recently been completed and will soon be stocked with 7.6 million fish fry. This single project will increase the country's revenue by at least 7.6 billion *yuan* per year. The revenue from four years of fish farming would be enough to build another reservoir of the same size.
    Reservoir fish farming is an advanced Soviet experience and a new endeavor in China. Its advantages are that there are few wild fish in the reservoir, management is convenient, and the survival rate is high. The disadvantage is that there is little natural feed. Hubei Province has solved this problem through experimentation with simple artificial feeding methods. In order to improve reservoir fish farming and expand the farming area, the Hubei Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau has established a special office to manage reservoir fish farming throughout the province. At the same time, the Provincial People's Government Aquatic Products Bureau is also paying attention to helping farmers raise fish in small reservoirs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖北省各地利用水库养鱼
    湖北省采用苏联水库养鱼的先进经验，从去年七月到现在，先后在三十七个大、中型水库中放养了七百八十八万多尾鱼苗。已经养鱼的水库面积，约占全省现有大、中型水库面积的百分之七十左右。其中的鱼苗，最大的已长到一、二斤重。目前正是鱼苗放养季节，湖北省各地又陆续扩大大、中型水库养鱼的面积。预计到今年底，全省大、中型水库中放养鱼苗的面积将扩大到百分之九十左右，放养的鱼将达一千七百八十多万尾。以百分之五十的成活率和每尾鱼年长一斤计算，一年就可产鲜鱼八百九十多万斤。全省最大的水库石龙过江水库最近完工后，将随即放养七百六十万尾鱼。仅此一项，每年为国家增加的收入最少也在七十六亿元以上。四年养鱼的收入，就可以再修一个这样大的水库。
    水库养鱼是苏联的先进经验，在中国还是新的尝试。它的优点是水库内野鱼少，管理方便，成活率大；缺点是自然饵料少。湖北省经过试验，已用简易的人工施饵法解决了这个问题。为了搞好水库养鱼，扩大养鱼面积，湖北省人民政府水利局特设专职干部管理全省的水库养鱼工作。同时，省人民政府水产局也注意帮助各地农民群众在小型水库中养鱼。　（新华社）
