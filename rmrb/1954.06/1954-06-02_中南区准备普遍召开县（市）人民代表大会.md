Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st. The Central South Region is preparing to universally convene county (city) People's Congresses in the latter half of June. From May 25th to 27th, the Guidance and Election Office of the Central South Administrative Committee convened a meeting of the directors of the election committee offices of each province and city in the Central South Region, focusing on studying various issues related to the preparations for convening county (city) People's Congresses in various localities. They also listened to reports from representatives of each province and city on the grassroots election work. At the meeting, representatives from each province and city reported on the preparations for convening the People's Congresses. Representatives from Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces also gave typical speeches, introducing the experiences of pilot areas in convening People's Congresses. Representatives from each province and city fully exchanged views on the issue of universally convening county (city) People's Congresses throughout the region. The meeting suggested that each province's special districts should first select one or two counties to convene People's Congresses in advance to gain experience, and then universally convene them. Based on the experience of pilot areas, the meeting believed that each county (city) must ensure that the People's Congresses are well convened, and the key to convening them well lies in leadership attention and full promotion of democracy; grassroots People's Congresses and county People's Congresses should conscientiously select representatives to attend the People's Congresses at the next higher level; the central topics of the congresses must be clearly highlighted, and in accordance with the spirit of the state's general task in the transition period, combined with the specific conditions of the region, the key issues in the current work should be resolved. These central topics must be fully discussed before making practical and feasible resolutions. After the meeting, the work of conveying the resolutions of the People's Congresses should be conscientiously carried out, and all strata of the people should be united to strive for the implementation of the resolutions of the People's Congresses.

    中南区准备普遍召开县（市）人民代表大会
    【新华社武汉三十一日电】中南全区准备在六月份下半月普遍召开县（市）人民代表大会。中南行政委员会指导选举办公室在五月二十五日到二十七日召开了中南各省、市选举委员会办公室主任会议，着重研究了关于各地准备召开县（市）人民代表大会的各项问题，同时还听了各省、市代表关于基层选举工作的汇报。在会上各省、市代表汇报了关于召开人民代表大会的准备情况。广东和江西两省代表还作了典型发言，介绍试办地区召开人民代表大会的经验。各省、市代表对即将在全区普遍召开县（市）人民代表大会的问题充分交换了意见。会议建议各省的专区应首先选择一、二个县先行召开人民代表大会，取得经验，然后普遍召开。会议根据试办地区的经验认为各县（市）必须保证开好人民代表大会，而开好人民代表大会的关键在于领导重视和充分发扬民主；基层人民代表大会和县人民代表大会应该认真选好出席上一级人民代表大会的代表；大会的中心议题必须明确突出，依据国家在过渡时期总任务的精神，结合本地区具体情况，解决当前工作中的关键问题。这些中心议题必须经过充分讨论后作出切实可行的决议。会后，还应该认真作好传达人民代表大会决议的工作，并团结各阶层人民，为贯彻人民代表大会决议而奋斗。
