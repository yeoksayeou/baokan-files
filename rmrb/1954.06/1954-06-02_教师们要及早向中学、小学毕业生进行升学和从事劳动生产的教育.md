Teachers Should Educate Middle School and Elementary School Graduates on Further Education and Engaging in Labor Production as Soon as Possible
Lin Liru

    The school year will soon reach summer vacation. Guiding graduating students to correctly resolve their issues of further education and engaging in labor production will be one of the key focuses of ideological education for teachers at all schools during this period. During the summer of 1953, due to our insufficient and untimely guidance for graduates of senior elementary schools and junior middle schools regarding further education and engaging in production, ideological confusion occurred among graduates of senior elementary schools and junior middle schools in various regions. Some students believed that graduation only led to further education, without considering engaging in productive labor; therefore, they became emotionally unstable when they couldn't pursue further education. The reasons for this erroneous view are complex. On one hand, it is due to the influence of the exploiting class's ideas of belittling physical labor and workers and peasants, which have been passed down from the old society. On the other hand, it is due to the Ministry of Education's insufficient clarity regarding the goals and tasks of middle and elementary school education, insufficient attention to political and ideological education, and especially a lack of concrete guidance on labor education, leading to a situation where middle and elementary school education neglects labor education and even has a certain degree of separation between education and productive labor. Today, learning from past mistakes, we must pay close attention to this issue and correct these errors and shortcomings.

    In the four years since liberation, teachers across the country have participated in various social reform movements, undergone ideological remolding studies, political theory studies, and the study of advanced Soviet educational science theory. Their political consciousness has improved to some extent, and their teaching work has also achieved certain results. However, due to the reasons mentioned above, some teachers are inevitably still more or less influenced by the erroneous ideas of belittling physical labor and laborers. For example, they are unwilling to see their students become workers or peasants, express regret when students with good grades fail to get into schools, or inappropriately teach students to pursue further education, become experts, or become cadres. If students fail to get into schools, they feel they have let down the students and their parents.

    Obviously, these views have had a negative impact on national construction and students' ideological education. To change this situation, teachers must understand the following issues:

    First, it is important to understand that the Central People's Government pays great attention to cultivating talent for national construction and raising the cultural level of the people. In the past four years, governments at all levels have taken various measures as much as possible to develop education, resulting in unprecedented development in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools. However, the development of culture and education must have a solid material foundation. Education cannot develop further without production reaching a certain level.

    We must understand that the glorious task of the people's teachers is to achieve the goals of school education during the national transition period, and cultivate the younger generation to become comprehensively developed members of socialist society—laborers with political awareness, cultural cultivation, and healthy physique. In the new society, labor is valued and production comes first. Labor is the glorious cause of all citizens with labor ability in the new China. Learning is to prepare for better labor. After further education and graduation, one must also engage in labor. Without further education, one can engage in labor first, and also learn in the practice of labor. In the past four years, many heroes and role models have emerged in industry and agriculture, all of whom are backbone members trained in production and construction, proving that "top talents" can emerge in any field. Graduates of middle and elementary schools with some education, as long as they actively engage in productive labor, will find success even easier. Last year, in provinces such as Northeast China, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, hundreds of thousands of graduates from senior elementary schools and junior middle schools participated in industrial and agricultural labor, proving that the education they received is of great help to production, and they are welcomed and respected by the masses. In some factories in the Soviet Union, 70% of the workers are high school graduates, and many Stakhanovite-style labor heroes have emerged among them. The old society of "all occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," where scholars did not labor and laborers did not study, is gone forever. If the students we teach can love labor, see labor as a glorious cause, and contribute their abilities to the various construction works needed by the country, then they are the glorious youth of the new China, and we are glorious teachers. The task of any level of school is to cultivate laborers with political awareness, cultural cultivation, and healthy physique. The main measure of a teacher's educational success should be whether the students they cultivate can become comprehensively developed laborers and perform actively and creatively in their work.

    Some students think that they cannot learn without further education, and this understanding is also incorrect. Teachers should carefully analyze and explain: it is true that young people learn when they study in school, but this is only to open the door to knowledge; after leaving school and engaging in productive labor, they should continue to study hard, actively delve into, and enthusiastically create in labor, which is the most practical learning. As for taking supplementary courses in culture and science in spare time, that is also learning. There are also opportunities for advanced studies after a certain period of work. Studying in school, learning in labor, transferring from school to work, and then returning to school after a certain stage of work will be the normal state of life for young people in the new China. It is impossible for everyone to study continuously from elementary school to middle school, and from middle school to university before starting work, nor is it impossible to learn after starting work. Teachers must recognize this new life of young people in order to correctly guide students in solving the problem of further education and engaging in productive labor.

    It is a good thing that many young people are determined to become experts. But it is wrong if they think that only further education can cultivate experts, or that becoming experts can avoid labor. First of all, it must be affirmed that all experts must labor, and should also labor diligently. It is impossible in the new society to think that becoming an expert means less labor and more pay. In the new society, unearned income is not glorious. All laborers, whether workers or peasants, can become experts as long as they can exert initiative and creativity in their work and continue to study hard. This is a characteristic of the new society. The great Stalin encouraged Soviet workers to raise their knowledge and skills to the level of engineers and technicians. Does that mean that workers would not be workers after reaching that level? Absolutely not. I hope that teachers can guide students to correctly understand the issue of becoming experts.

    Some graduating students are willing to engage in productive labor, but only want to work in large factories and are unwilling to engage in agricultural labor, which is also incorrect. Teachers must provide good enlightenment and guidance. Although our motherland's construction during the transition period focuses on industry, it does not mean developing industry in isolation. Agriculture must also be developed accordingly to support industrial construction. The grain needed by workers and some raw materials for industrial use must be supplied by agricultural production. Therefore, agricultural production occupies a very important position in our country's economic construction. Our development of industry is also to create the necessary conditions for the development of agriculture. Teachers should let students know that a large number of promising and ambitious young people engaged in rural productive labor will make a great contribution to social development. For young people themselves, this is also a place to show their heroism. Those who one-sidedly emphasize industry and belittle agriculture, and dislike agriculture, have incorrect views.

    Only when teachers thoroughly understand the above principles can they carry out labor education well for students, and guide this year's graduating students to engage in productive labor and further education. The experience of some regions shows that it is very beneficial for school leaders to organize all teachers to conduct some studies on labor education in conjunction with the overall task, which can help teachers ideologically distinguish the different views of the bourgeoisie and the working class on labor.

    Conducting labor education for students is one of the main contents of long-term and regular political and ideological education, which should be carried out through classroom teaching and extracurricular activities. Conducting political and ideological education for students through school's Youth League and Young Pioneers organizations is one of the most effective methods, and teachers and class teachers should pay special attention to it. The tendency of some regions and some schools to treat this ideological education as a crash task, or to carry out education rigidly without regard to the specific ideological situation of the students, should be corrected.

    We must pay great attention to the issue of senior elementary school and junior middle school graduating students engaging in production and further education this year. We must seize the opportunity to educate them, solve their ideological problems, and enable them to engage in productive labor or further education happily after graduation. To cooperate with classroom teaching, leading students to visit the production conditions of nearby factories and farms, inviting labor models or production staff to give reports at the school will make it easier for students to understand that today's productive labor requires scientific knowledge, and learning is to prepare for better labor. Appropriately organizing physical labor, commending students who love labor, paying more attention to ideological education for graduating class students, and contacting and connecting with graduates who are engaged in productive labor, using their good examples to encourage students at school, these methods are in line with the educational principle of "unity of theory and practice," and can also solve students' ideological problems well, which teachers should pay great attention to.

    Positive and proactive educational methods should be adopted when conducting labor education for students, and crude, sarcastic, and attacking methods should never be adopted. Some schools have already adopted inappropriate methods when carrying out this education, making students feel a sense of pressure, which is obviously inappropriate.

    Of course, teachers should allow students who want to pursue further education to take the exams, and should give them guidance so that they understand that preparing for exams should be based on their usual academic performance. Those who "pierce their ears just before the wedding" before the exam will make students excessively nervous and tired, and even harm their health. Teachers who understand educational principles should never teach students to do that. Teachers should conduct ideological education for students on a regular basis, so that students understand the reason why it is not possible for everyone to pursue further education at present, and understand that both further education and engaging in productive labor have bright futures. This will make it easier for students to understand that not being admitted to the exam is not a shameful thing, nor is it a failure. Feeling pessimistic and desperate because they are not admitted to the exam is a bad habit of the old imperial examination era, and the young people of the new China should never do this. Middle school Chinese teachers may wish to guide students to select and read a few pages of "The Scholars" outside of class, so that they know how many foolish and ridiculous uglinesses there were in the imperial examination era.

    Teachers should be good teachers to students and beneficial friends to students' parents, which is especially necessary today. It is only natural for parents to eagerly hope that their children go to school; especially parents with worker and peasant backgrounds, because they themselves lost their education in their early years, their desire for their children to study today is even more urgent, and this enthusiasm is understandable. However, parents often do not understand the country's education policy during the transition period and the goals and tasks of middle and elementary school education today, so misunderstandings inevitably occur regarding the issue of their children's schooling or further education. For example, when they see that their children cannot pursue further education, they are dissatisfied with their children, dissatisfied with the school, and even dissatisfied with the People's Government. As educators, teachers have the responsibility to explain to parents, dispel misunderstandings, publicize the People's Government's education policy, explain the goals and tasks of middle and elementary school education, and teach the basic principles of educating children. If parents do not know the educational principles and do not understand the educational policy, teachers have the responsibility to enlighten them and help them clear their minds. If parents do not know that the new production work requires culture, teachers should also explain and explain it to them more. Teachers must not only teach students well, but also persuade parents, which also illustrates the lofty status and arduous tasks of teachers. This requires teachers to develop a high degree of spirit of serving the people and consciously and actively do their work well. I believe that our teachers will complete this glorious and arduous task they shoulder.

    教师们要及早向中学、小学毕业生进行升学和从事劳动生产的教育
    林砺儒
    这个学年很快就到暑假了，指导将届毕业的学生们正确地解决他们升学和从事劳动生产的问题，将是各校教师们这一时期思想教育的重点之一。一九五三年暑期，由于我们对高小和初中毕业生升学和从事生产的指导，做得不够和不及时，各地曾发生高小毕业生和初中毕业生思想混乱的情形。有些学生以为毕了业就只有升学一途，而不想到从事生产劳动；因此，升不了学就情绪波动。造成这种错误看法的原因是复杂的，一方面是由于学生受旧社会流传下来的轻视体力劳动、轻视工农的剥削阶级思想的影响；另一方面，则是由于中央教育部对中、小学教育的目的和任务，交代得不够明确，对政治思想教育注意不够，特别是对劳动教育缺乏应有的具体指导，以致形成中、小学教育忽视劳动教育，甚至存在着一定程度的教育和生产劳动脱节的毛病。今天惩前毖后，我们必须十分重视这一问题，纠正这方面的错误和缺点。
    解放四年以来，全国教师们由于参加了各种社会改革运动，进行了思想改造学习、政治理论学习和苏联先进教育科学理论的学习，政治觉悟是有所提高的，教学工作也是有一定成绩的。但由于上述原因，有些教师不免还或多或少受着轻视体力劳动和轻视劳动人民的错误思想的影响。如不愿看到自己的学生当工人或农民，对于功课较好的学生考不上学校表示惋惜，或者不适当地教学生升学、当专家、当干部。如果学生考不上学校，觉得自己对不起学生，对不起家长。
    显然，这些看法对于国家建设和学生的思想教育都发生了不好的影响。为了改变这种情况，教师同志必须了解以下问题：
    首先要了解：中央人民政府是十分注意培养国家建设人才、提高人民文化水平的。过去四年间各级人民政府曾尽可能地采取各种措施来发展教育，因而大、中、小学都得到空前的发展。但是，文化教育的发展必须有坚实的物质基础。生产发展不到一定的水平，教育便不可能作更大的发展。
    我们必须了解，人民教师的光荣任务是要实现国家过渡时期学校教育的目标，培养青年一代成为社会主义社会全面发展的成员——有政治觉悟、文化教养和健康体质的劳动者。新社会是劳动为贵、生产第一。劳动是新中国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事业。学习就是准备更好地劳动，升了学，毕业后，也要从事劳动，不升学，先从事劳动，在劳动实践中也可以学习。四年来，工业和农业中都涌现了许多英雄模范，他们全是在生产建设中锻炼出来的骨干分子，证明行行都能出“状元”。受了一定教育的中、小学毕业生，只要积极从事生产劳动，成功会更加容易。去年东北各省、河北省和山东省、江苏省等地区，有成千成万高小毕业生和初中毕业生参加了工业和农业劳动，证明他们所受的教育对于生产大有帮助，他们都受到群众的欢迎和尊重。苏联有些工厂有百分之七十的工人是高中毕业生，他们当中出现了很多斯塔哈诺夫式的劳动英雄。“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”，认为读书人就不劳动，劳动者就不读书的旧社会一去不复返了。我们教出来的学生如果都能够热爱劳动，把劳动看成是光荣的事业，把自己的能力贡献于国家所需要的各项建设工作，那才是新中国的光荣的青年，而我们便是光荣的教师。无论那一级学校，它的任务都是培养有政治觉悟、有文化教养和健康体质的劳动者。衡量教师的教育成绩，主要应当看他所培养出来的学生能不能成为全面发展的劳动者，并在工作中表现积极、有所创造。
    有些学生以为不升学就不能学习，这种认识也是不对的。教师应仔细地加以分析解释：青年在学校念书固然是学习，这只不过是为求知识打开大门；离开学校从事生产劳动以后，还应该在劳动中继续努力学习，积极钻研，热心创造，这是最实际的学习。至于工作之余，补习文化和科学知识，也是学习。工作一定时期之后，也还有深造的机会。在学校中学习，在劳动中学习，从学校出来转入工作，工作到一定阶段，再入学校，这样的更迭进行，将是新中国的青年们的生活常态，决不能每人都要一口气从小学念到中学，从中学念到大学才开始工作，也不会参加了工作便不能学习。教师们必须认识到青年这样的新生活，才能正确地指导学生解决升学和从事劳动生产的问题。
    有许多青年立志当专家，这是好事。但是如果认为只有升学才能培养成专家，或者认为当专家便可避免劳动，那便错误了。首先要肯定，不论当什么专家都要劳动，并且还应辛勤地劳动。以为当了专家，就可以少劳动多得报酬，那在新社会里是不可能的。在新社会里，不劳而获，是不光荣的事。所有劳动者，无论工人或农民，只要能在工作中发挥积极性和创造性，不断地努力学习，也可成为专家。这是新社会的一个特点。伟大的斯大林鼓励苏联工人们把他们自己的知识技能提高到工程师、技师的水平。难道工人们达到那样水平之后就都不当工人了吗？决不是的。我盼望教师们能够引导学生正确地认识做专家的问题。
    有些毕业学生愿意从事劳动生产，但只想到大工厂去劳动，不愿从事农业劳动，这也是不对的。教师必须很好地予以启发指导。我们祖国在过渡时期的建设，虽然以工业为重点，但决不是孤立地单搞工业，还必须相应地发展农业，以支援工业建设。工人需要的粮食和工业用的部分原料，都要靠农业生产来供应。因此，农业生产在我国经济建设中占着很重要的地位。我们发展工业也是为发展农业创造必要的条件。教师们应该让学生们晓得，大批有为有志的青年从事农村劳动生产，对社会发展将有很大贡献。对青年本身来说，这也是英雄用武之地。那些片面强调工业而轻视农业，厌恶农业的见解，是不正确的。
    只有当教师们彻底理解了上述的道理之后，才能很好地向学生进行劳动教育，才能很好地指导今年的毕业学生从事劳动生产和升学的问题。有些地区的经验说明：学校领导同志组织全体教师结合总任务进行一些有关劳动教育的学习，是有很大好处的，这可以帮助教师们在思想上分辨资产阶级和工人阶级对待劳动的不同的看法。
    向学生进行劳动教育是长期的、经常的政治思想教育的主要内容之一，应该通过课堂教学和课外活动来进行。通过学校中的团、队组织对学生进行政治思想教育，是最有效的方式之一。教师和班主任应该特别予以重视。现在有的地区、有的学校，将这一思想教育，作为一个突击性的工作去做，或者不根据学生的具体思想情况，生硬地去进行教育的偏向，应予以纠正。
    我们必须十分重视今年高小和初中毕业学生从事生产和升学的问题。必须抓紧向他们进行教育，解决他们思想上的问题，使他们在毕业后都能愉快地从事劳动生产或升学。要配合课堂教学，领导学生参观附近工厂、农场的生产状况，邀请劳动模范或生产工作人员来校做报告，这会使学生更容易认识今天的劳动生产是需要科学知识的，学习就是为了准备更好地劳动。适当地组织体力劳动，表扬爱劳动的学生，对毕业班学生多注意思想教育，和从事生产劳动的毕业生多多接触，取得联系，用他们的好榜样以鼓励在校的学生，这些方法都符合“理论与实际一致”的教育原则，又可以很好地解决学生们的思想问题，值得教师们十分重视。
    对学生进行劳动教育，应采取正面的积极的教育方法，决不可采取粗暴的讽刺打击的办法。现在已有些学校在进行这一教育时，采取了不妥当的办法，使学生感觉是一种压力，这显然是不妥当的。
    教师对于想要升学的学生，当然应当让他们去应考，并应给以指导，使他们了解准备考试应凭平时学习的成绩。那些在考试之前“临嫁穿耳”的做法，会使学生过度紧张疲劳，甚至妨害身体健康，了解教育原理的教师决不应教学生那样做。教师应在平素对学生进行思想教育，使学生了解现在还不可能全部升学的道理，并了解升学和从事劳动生产都有光明的前途，那就容易使学生了解考试不取并不是什么丢人的事情，也不是什么失败。考试不取，表示悲观绝望，那是旧日科举时代的陋习，今天新中国的青年决不应如此。中学语文教师不妨在课外指导学生选读几页“儒林外史”，让他们晓得在科举时代有过多少愚蠢而可笑的丑态。
    教师们要做学生的良师，也要做学生家长的益友，这在今天尤为必要。家长切望自己的子女上学，那是人情之常；尤其是工农成份的家长，由于他们自己早年失学，今天盼望子女读书的心情更迫切，这种热情是以可解理的。然而家长们对于过渡时期国家的教育政策和今天中、小学教育的目的和任务往往了解不够，因而对子女上学或升学的问题，难免发生误解，例如看到子女升不了学，就对自己的子女不满，对学校不满，甚至对人民政府不满。作为教育工作者的教师们，就有责任对家长们进行解释，解除误会，宣传人民政府的教育方针，说明中、小学教育的目的和任务以及教导子女的基本原则。家长们不知道教育原则，也不了解教育方针，教师们就有责任对家长开导，帮助他们打通思想。家长们不晓得新的生产工作是需要文化的，教师们也要向他们多作解释和说明。教师们既要教好学生，又要说服家长，这也说明了教师地位的崇高和任务的艰巨。这就要求教师们发挥高度为人民服务的精神，来自觉地积极地做好自己的工作。我相信我们的教师们一定会完成自己所肩负的这一光荣而艰巨的任务。
