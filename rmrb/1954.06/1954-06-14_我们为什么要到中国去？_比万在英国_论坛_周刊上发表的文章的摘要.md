Xinhua News Agency, London, 5th dispatch from TASS: The "Tribune" weekly published an article by Bevan entitled "Why Are We Going to China?". This article sharply criticizes the unfounded and slanderous attacks made by the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, against the People's Republic of China in his speech on May 25th.

Bevan wrote: "Certainly, millions of Americans disagree with Lodge's views. They are frustrated and worried by this opinion. They are trying to change this opinion and are fighting for it. We wish them the greatest success...

"American spokesmen have repeatedly tried to make the United Nations a forum for discussing the war in Indochina. They do this because they know that such discussions are bound to be fruitless, because Communist China is excluded from the United Nations."

Bevan went on to say that the accusation that the People's Republic of China is an aggressor is far-fetched and unfounded. He ridiculed one of Lodge's statements, saying that China is taking aggressive action against its own people. Bevan said: "Thus, we have a new definition of aggression. Apparently, it is now possible for a country to 'aggress' against its own people. If this has any meaning at all, then it means that the main charge against revolutionary China is: China is revolutionary China. According to this, we must understand political and social revolution as an act of aggression. If a country's revolution does not provoke military sanctions aimed at suppressing this revolution, then this revolutionary action will make the country guilty and therefore ineligible for membership in the United Nations. How long can this definition apply? If it also applies to things long past, then the United States itself should be excluded from the United Nations for this reason."

Bevan then pointed out that the United States publicly opposes revolutionary China while concluding a military agreement with Franco's Spain. He wrote: "The official policy of the United States is to turn the United Nations into an organization against revolution."

Bevan said: "It is inconceivable that the Communist Chinese government should be deprived of its membership in the United Nations 'because it fully exercises sovereignty within its own borders.'" He concluded by writing: "The British Labour Party delegation hopes to find possibilities for friendly exchanges and full cooperation in Communist China."

    我们为什么要到中国去？
    比万在英国“论坛”周刊上发表的文章的摘要
   【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦五日电：“论坛”周刊刊载了比万的一篇文章，题目是“我们为什么要到中国去？”这篇文章尖锐地抨击了美国驻联合国代表洛奇在五月二十五日的演说中对中华人民共和国进行的毫无根据的、诽谤性的攻击。
    比万写道：“肯定的，有千百万美国人是不同意洛奇的意见的。他们因这种意见而感到沮丧和忧虑。他们正努力要改变这种意见并为此而斗争。我们祝他们得到最大的成功……
    “美国发言人不止一次地想使联合国成为讨论印度支那战争的场合。他们这样做是由于知道这种讨论必然得不到结果，因为共产党中国被排斥在联合国以外。”
    比万又说，诬蔑中华人民共和国是侵略者的指责是牵强而且毫无根据的。他嘲笑洛奇的一种说法，洛奇说，中国正对中国本国人民采取侵略行动。比万说：“这样，我们就有了一个新的侵略定义了。显然，现在一个国家有可能‘侵略’它自己的人民了。假如这样说有任何意义的话，那么这就是说，对革命的中国的主要指责是：中国是革命的中国。照这样说来，我们就要把政治与社会的革命理解成为一种侵略行动了。如果一个国家的革命不引起旨在镇压这一革命的军事制裁，那末，这种革命行动就会使得这个国家有罪，并因此而不能获得联合国会员国的资格。这个定义能适用多长的时间呢？假如它也能适用于过去很久的事情的话，那末美国自己也应因为这一点而被排斥在联合国以外了。”
    比万接着指出美国公开反对革命的中国而与佛朗哥西班牙缔结军事协定。他写道：“美国的官方政策是想把联合国变成一个反对革命的组织。”
    比万说：“由于共产党中国政府在它自己的国界内充分行使主权而认为应该剥夺它的联合国会员国资格”这是不可思议的。他最后写道：“英国工党代表团希望在共产党中国发现友好交往与圆满合作的可能性。”
