    The Will of Japanese Youth, Students, and Women to Defend Peace
    Lan Hai
    Since the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, disregarding the opposition of the Japanese people, signed the "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," the Japanese people have launched an increasingly large-scale struggle of resistance. Japanese youth, students, and women are bravely standing at the forefront of the struggle, and their actions are becoming more unified and their strength more united and powerful.
    From May 2nd to 5th, the "Japanese Student Peace Conference" was held in Tokyo. From May 9th to 10th, the "Japanese Youth and Women's Conference for Peace" was held in Tokyo. It was the first time that Japanese youth, students, and women held such national conferences. Both conferences were large in scale and extremely representative. Participating in the "Japanese Student Peace Conference" were more than 1,000 representatives from 120 student organizations, including the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, the Japan War Bereaved Students Memorial Society, the Japanese YMCA, and the Japanese Buddhist Student League. The "Japanese Youth and Women's Conference for Peace" was jointly prepared by more than 50 youth and women's organizations, including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Youth Organization Council, the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, and the Japan Democratic Youth League, and was attended by 2,600 representatives of young workers, farmers, women, and students from all over Japan.
    These two conferences received enthusiastic support from Japanese peace organizations and many party figures. Japanese peace movement leaders such as Ikuo Oyama and Kenjuro Yanagida of the Japan Peace Committee, Saburo Awatade, a member of the World Peace Council, and Yaizu Kazahaya, a member of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, and Yasushi Hasegawa, a member of the Left-wing Socialist Party, and Sonoko Nikaido, a representative of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," attended the conferences. The conferences also received congratulatory telegrams and letters from the World Peace Council, the International Democratic Youth Federation, the International Student Union, the All-China Students' Federation, and many peace and democratic organizations in Japan. This fully demonstrates that the struggle of Japanese youth, students, and women to defend peace is closely linked to the struggle of the Japanese people and the people of the world to defend peace.
    The speeches of the delegates at the conference reflected that the economic, political, and cultural lives of the vast majority of Japanese youth, students, and women today are in an extremely painful situation. Most Japanese youth cannot study in schools, and the burden of life weighs heavily on them. Students who work part-time and study part-time are exhausted during the day and feel dizzy in class at night. Young urban workers of both sexes suffer from unemployment and low wages, and marriage has become a fantasy. Most young rural farmers have no land to cultivate and are generally unemployed or semi-employed. The democratic rights of youth and women are being trampled upon, and the reactionary Yoshida authorities and their henchmen—foremen in factories, local bullies in rural areas, and spies in schools—interfere with the freedom of young men and women everywhere. Participating in activities to defend peace is falsely accused and persecuted, dismissed, or expelled from school.
    After discussion, the representatives at the meeting became more clearly aware that the miserable lives of Japanese youth, students, and women today are the result of the reactionary Yoshida government, under the manipulation of the United States, implementing a policy of rearmament, spending large amounts of military expenses, implementing fascist rule to destroy democracy, and dragging Japan into a war of aggression. The delegates unanimously agreed that in order to defend peace, Japanese youth, students, and women must resolutely struggle. The delegates also emphasized the importance of promoting friendly relations between the Japanese people and the people of the Soviet Union and China. They expressed their determination to work hard to restore normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and to strengthen friendship and close ties with the youth, students, and women of all countries, especially China and the Soviet Union.
    At the same time, the participating representatives pointed out that the Japanese people's struggle is rapidly expanding. The signature campaign to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs is underway across the country. Osaka alone plans to collect one million signatures, and young women in Tokyo collected 80,000 signatures near the city's train stations in just four days in late April. Japanese youth, especially rural youth, are launching a movement to resist conscription. The Japan War Bereaved Students Memorial Society has collected 280,000 signatures against conscription. The struggle of the people of Wakayama, Tottori, Ehime, Gunma, and other prefectures against military bases is also continuing.
    The vast majority of Japanese youth, students, and women are determined to exert greater strength in the current struggle.
      The "Japanese Student Peace Conference" decided to focus on opposing the Yoshida government's rearmament policy, banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and striving for peaceful and democratic education as the central tasks of the future national student struggle to defend peace. Furthermore, in order to further expand the Japanese students' peace struggle, the conference decided to establish a national permanent liaison organization to mobilize a wider range of students to oppose war and defend peace.
      The entire body of representatives to the "Japanese Youth and Women's Conference for Peace" resolved: 1. To widely launch a signature campaign demanding the prohibition of the use, testing, and manufacture of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and to hold local conferences to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs in each region before August 15th; 2. To further expand the anti-conscription movement; 3. To promote the struggle to defend the lives of young people, organize forces by region to carry out joint struggles, and establish regional executive committees to exchange struggle experiences; 4. To launch a large-scale struggle against amending the Peace Constitution and defending human rights. The conference also passed a declaration, stating:
  "There can be no freedom and happy life where there is no peace,"
  "Now is the time for Japanese youth to defend peace with firm determination, we must overcome all difficulties to defend peace to the end." At the same time,
  "In order to build a peaceful life for youth, Japanese youth must tightly link the strength united at the 'Japanese Youth and Women's Conference for Peace' with the strength of youth around the world defending peace, linking arms with each other, and spreading the song of defending peace loudly and powerfully throughout the world."
      The great achievements of the "Japanese Student Peace Conference" and the "Japanese Youth and Women's Conference for Peace" will greatly promote the struggle of Japanese youth, students, and women to defend peace. The increasing unity and strengthening of the struggle of Japanese youth, students, and women to defend peace will become a powerful force that cannot be ignored in the Japanese people's struggle against the rearmament of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and to defend peace.

    日本青年、学生和妇女保卫和平的意志
    蓝海
    自美日反动派不顾日本全国人民的反对、签订“共同防御援助协定”以来，日本人民就展开了规模日益壮阔的反抗斗争。日本青年、学生和妇女英勇地站在斗争的前列，并且行动日趋统一、力量日趋团结强大起来。
    五月二日至五日，东京举行了“日本学生和平会议”，五月九日至十日，东京举行了“日本青年、妇女争取和平大会”。日本青年、学生和妇女举行这样的全国性会议，都还是头一次。两个大会都是规模巨大而且代表性极其广泛。参加“日本学生和平会议”的有全日本学生自治会总联合会、日本战殁学生纪念会、日本基督教青年会、日本佛教学生联盟等一百二十个学生团体的一千多名代表。“日本青年、妇女争取和平大会”则是在日本工会总评议会、日本青年团体协议会、全日本学生自治会总联合会、日本民主青年团等五十多个青年、妇女团体联合筹备下，由来自日本各地的青年工人、农民、妇女和学生代表二千六百人参加而举行的。
    这两个大会得到了日本和平组织和许多党派人士的热烈支持。日本拥护和平委员会大山郁夫、柳田谦十郎、世界和平理事会理事淡德三郎等日本和平运动的领导者及日本共产党中央指导部委员风早八十二、左派社会党议员长谷川保、“松川事件”无辜被告代表二阶堂园子等分别参加了大会。大会并收到了世界和平理事会、国际民主青年联盟、国际学生联合会、中华全国学生联合会等及日本国内许多和平、民主团体的贺电贺信。这充分显示出日本青年、学生和妇女保卫和平的斗争是和日本人民、世界人民保卫和平的斗争紧紧联系在一起的。
    参加大会代表们的发言，反映出今天日本广大青年、学生和妇女的经济、政治和文化生活，都已陷于极端苦痛的境地。日本青年绝大部分不能在学校中读书，生活负担沉重地压在青年们的身上。半工半读的学生白天累得精疲力尽、晚上上课时头昏目眩。城市青年男女工人受着失业和低工资的煎熬，结婚都成了幻想。农村青年农民大部无地可耕、普遍是失业或半失业。青年和妇女的民主权利横遭蹂躏，吉田反动当局和它的爪牙——工厂中的监工、农村中的恶霸和学校中的特务，处处干涉男女青年的自由。参加保卫和平的活动会被加上莫须有的罪名，遭到迫害、解雇或退学。
    经过讨论后，参加会议的代表们更加清楚地认识到，今天日本青年、学生和妇女的苦难生活，是由于吉田反动政府在美国操纵下执行重整军备政策，大量支出军费、实施法西斯统治摧残民主、把日本拖向侵略战争的结果。代表们一致认为，为了保卫和平，日本青年、学生和妇女必须坚决斗争。代表们并强调日本人民和苏联、中国人民增进友好关系的重要性。他们表示将努力恢复日本和中国、苏联之间的正常关系，加强和各国特别是中苏两国的青年、学生和妇女的友谊和紧密联系。
    同时，与会的代表们指出：日本人民的斗争正在迅速扩展。要求禁止原子弹、氢弹的签名运动正在全国展开，大阪市一地就准备征集一百万人的签名，东京市的青年妇女四月下旬在市内车站附近四天中就征集了八万个人的签名。日本青年特别是农村青年正在展开抵制招兵的运动。日本战殁学生纪念会已征集了二十八万人反对征兵的签名。和歌山、鸟取、爱媛、群马等县人民反对军事基地的斗争也在继续进行。
    日本广大青年、学生和妇女决心要在当前的斗争中发挥更大的力量。
      “日本学生和平会议”决定以反对吉田政府的重新武装政策、禁止原子弹氢弹、争取和平民主的教育作为今后全国学生保卫和平斗争的中心任务。并且，为了进一步扩展日本学生的和平斗争，会议决定设立一个全国范围的常设联络机构，动员更广泛的学生起来反对战争，保卫和平。
      “日本青年、妇女争取和平大会”全体代表决议：一、广泛展开要求禁止使用、试验和制造原子弹氢弹的签名运动，在八月十五日前，各地区举行地方性的禁止原子弹氢弹大会；二、进一步扩展反对征兵运动；三、推进保卫青年生活的斗争，按地区组织力量联合进行斗争，并成立地区的执行委员会交流斗争经验；四、大规模展开反对修改和平宪法及保卫人权的斗争。大会并通过了宣言，指出：
  “没有和平的地方就不能有自由和幸福的生活”，
  “现在正是日本青年以坚强决心保卫和平的时候，我们必须克服一切困难将和平保卫到底。”同时，
  “为了建立青年的和平生活，日本青年要把在‘日本青年、妇女争取和平大会’上团结起来的力量和全世界青年保卫和平的力量紧紧连结在一起，互相挽紧臂膀，把保卫和平的歌声响亮而有力地传遍全世界。”
      “日本学生和平会议”和“日本青年、妇女争取和平大会”的巨大成果，将大大推进日本青年、学生和妇女保卫和平的斗争。日本青年、学生和妇女保卫和平斗争的日益统一和加强，将成为日本人民反对美日反动派重整军备、保卫和平的斗争中不容忽视的强大力量。
