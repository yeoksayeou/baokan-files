Excellent Soviet Scientific Films
   “Cosmos” and Others Screened in Beijing
    The Soviet scientific educational films "Cosmos," "Weather Scouts," and "Solar Eclipse" began screening in the capital on June 3rd. These three scientific short films are excellent productions from the Soviet Union in the last two or three years. "Cosmos" vividly and graphically depicts the composition, movement, and magnificent scenes of the planets in the universe. It explains, from a scientific and materialistic viewpoint, that the universe is material, infinite, and knowable. It powerfully refutes the bourgeoisie's idealistic explanations and absurd theories about the universe. The film's moving descriptions make it seem as if the audience is on an interesting journey through the cosmos. This film powerfully demonstrates the outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists in astronomical research. The film's high artistic skill makes the secrets of the universe, as explored by Soviet scientists, exceptionally accessible to the audience. Due to its high achievements in both technology and science, this film was unanimously praised at the 7th International Film Festival in 1952 and won the Science Film Award. At the 7th Congress of the International Scientific Film Association in September 1953, this film aroused great interest among the participants.
    "Weather Scouts," through the work of Soviet meteorologists in observing the weather, explains the causes of wind, snow, clouds, rain, etc., in nature, as well as the high achievements of the Soviet Union in meteorology. Meteorological observation institutions are scattered throughout the Soviet Union, using precise scientific instruments to detect and predict climate changes, serving agriculture, animal husbandry, navigation, aviation, and other fields.
      "Solar Eclipse" truthfully records the total solar eclipse that occurred within the Soviet Union in 1952.

    苏联优秀科学影片
   “宇宙”等在北京放映
    苏联的科学教育影片“宇宙”“气象侦察员”
  “日蚀”，六月三日起在首都上映。这三部科学短片是苏联近两三年来出品的优秀影片。“宇宙”生动地、形象地把宇宙中星球的构成、运动规律以及各种壮丽的景象，加以描绘，它以科学的唯物主义的观点，说明了宇宙是物质的、无限的、而且是可以认识的，它有力地驳斥了资产阶级对宇宙的唯心解释和荒谬的学说。影片的动人描写，好像使观众在宇宙中作了一次有趣的旅行。这部影片有力地说明了苏联科学工作者在研究天文科学工作上的卓越成就，影片的高度艺术技巧，使苏联科学工作者所探索到的宇宙的秘密，异常通俗易懂地呈现在观众面前。这部影片因技术上和科学上都达到了很高的成就，在一九五二年第七届国际电影节上，得到一致好评，曾荣获科学片奖。在一九五三年九月第七届国际科学电影协会代表大会上，此片曾引起与会者的极大兴趣。
    “气象侦察员”通过苏联气象员对气象的观测工作，说明了大自然中风、雪、云、雨等的成因，以及苏联在气象学方面的高度成就。苏联各地的气象观测机构星罗棋布，他们用精密的科学仪器，侦察着和预告着气候的变化，为农业、牧畜、航海、航空等服务。
      “日蚀”真实地纪录了一九五二年苏联境内的日全蚀的情形。
