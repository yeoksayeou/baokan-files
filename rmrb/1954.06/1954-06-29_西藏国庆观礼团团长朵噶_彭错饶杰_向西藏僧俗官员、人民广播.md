Dorje Phuntsog Rabgye, the head of the Tibetan National Day Observation Group, broadcast in Tibetan on the Central People's Broadcasting Station from the 25th to the 27th to Tibetan monastic and secular officials and the people. He spoke about the observation group's participation in the 1953 National Day celebrations, paying respects to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government, and the group's experiences and thoughts on visiting various parts of the motherland.

He began by saying: Last year, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibetan local government sent us monastic and secular officials, living Buddhas and Khenpos from the four major monasteries of Tibet, etc., to participate in the National Day celebration of our motherland's big family and to pay respects to the great leader Chairman Mao and other leaders. After departing from Lhasa, we were received and helped by local governments and representatives of various fraternal ethnic groups along the way. On September 28th, when we arrived in the solemn and great capital, we were welcomed by Secretary-General Lin Boqu of the Central People's Government Committee, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun of the Government Administration Council, Chairman Li Weihan of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and other leaders of various agencies and representatives from all walks of life. On the 29th, the Government Administration Council hosted a banquet, and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping gave us instructions. On October 1st, we participated in the National Day observation ceremony. On the magnificent Tiananmen, there were the leaders of the Central People's Government, headed by our great Chairman Mao, the happy sun of all ethnic groups. As the parade began, powerful heroic troops such as infantry, cavalry, navy, and air force protecting the motherland, as well as various modern weapons such as airplanes and tanks, appeared before us. We personally witnessed the strength of the motherland's national defense, which further strengthened our confidence. We also saw a procession of about 400,000 people including workers, farmers, students, and citizens, all advancing with flowers and flags, unanimously shouting "Long live Chairman Mao," "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," the sound shaking like thunder. People were expressing their sincere love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao. On the 5th, the heads and deputy heads of the Tibetan, Qamdo, and Sichuan Tibetan observation groups also listened to the instructions of Li Weihan, Chairman of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, on strengthening national unity and attended a banquet. On the 6th, we were invited to a banquet hosted by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. On the 14th, all members of our group were invited to attend a symposium held by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

He then broadcast about paying respects to Chairman Mao. He said that on October 18th, the heads and deputy heads of our various Tibetan observation groups, visiting groups, etc., went to pay respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and presented gifts from the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibetan local government. Chairman Mao spoke with us for an hour and a half. Chairman Mao deeply cared about Tibet and the Tibetan people, and he welcomed our arrival. He gave us many valuable and clear instructions.

Chairman Mao instructed: We must talk about unity with all ethnic groups, and both large and small ethnic groups must unite. For example, the Oroqen ethnic group has less than two thousand people, and we must also unite with them. As long as they are Chinese, regardless of ethnicity, all who oppose imperialism and advocate patriotism and unity, we must unite with them. Unite, and work according to the different situations in different regions of each ethnic group. Some places can be done faster, some places can be done slower, whether doing it fast or slow, we must discuss it first before doing it, and we will not force it if it is not discussed. After discussion, if the majority agrees, then do it slowly. Doing good deeds also requires discussion. Discussing matters is the difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang oppresses people because they have power. They not only oppress ethnic minorities, but also oppress the majority of Han people. The Kuomintang does bad things. Bad things should not be done, and if our cadres make mistakes, they should be criticized. If there are any shortcomings or mistakes in our work in Tibet, please tell us. You can speak about anything you disagree with or anything you think is not beneficial to the people, so that we can correct it. Correcting shortcomings immediately is the difference between us and the Kuomintang.

Chairman Mao said that over the past two years, there has been progress in the mutual understanding between the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government, as well as between the Han and Tibetan nationalities. The Tibetan local government is getting closer to the central government and the relationship between Tibetans and Hans is getting closer day by day. I believe it will get even closer in the future.

Chairman Mao also instructed: The entire China is still very backward and needs to develop. This is because of the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang in the past. They have now been driven away by us, and we have made great progress in the past four years. After the national economy is restored, we will begin the first five-year plan for national construction this year. It is estimated that after three five-year plans, our large-scale industry will be established. The Soviet Union drove away imperialism and domestic bad guys thirty-six years ago and has only achieved its current achievements after thirty-six years of construction. We will build faster than the Soviet Union. Because we have the help of the Soviet Union. China has a large population, with over 500 million people, the most populous country in the world, and the land is also very vast. With three five-year plans, it can be built very well, and it will be of greater help to Tibet.

Chairman Mao said: The central government will definitely help you with whatever it can. Helping all ethnic minorities and allowing them to develop and progress is in the interest of the entire country. The development and progress of all ethnic minorities are promising.

Chairman Mao instructed: The development of Tibet's politics, economy, culture, and religion mainly depends on the leaders and people of Tibet discussing it themselves, and the central government only helps. This is written in the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. But to do it, it takes time, and it must be done gradually according to your wishes. Do it if it can be done, wait if it cannot be done; if it can be done, and the majority agrees, it is not good not to do it. It can be done slower, so that everyone is happy, and it will be faster in the end.

Chairman Mao finally instructed: In short, our policy is to unite and progress, and develop even more.

Chairman Mao's valuable instructions made us feel infinitely excited and happy. What I have said above are just some fragments that we remember.

Dorje Phuntsog Rabgye then broadcast his impressions of visiting various parts of the motherland. He said that the Central People's Government specially provided us with special cars and working cadres, medical personnel, etc., to visit Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Ta'er Monastery, Labrang in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the Northwest region; Shenyang, Fushun, Harbin, Dalian, Changchun, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the Northeast region; Hailar in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Shanghai, Nanjing, the Fozi Ridge, Hangzhou in the East China region; Wuhan, Guangzhou, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the Central South region; as well as Tianjin, Beijing, and other places, for a total of about six months. During the visit, we were warmly welcomed and received much help and guidance from the party and government leaders at all levels and representatives of all ethnic groups. We have seen the new atmosphere of equality, friendship, and unity among all ethnic groups in the motherland's big family, and we feel unspeakably happy in our hearts.

In the broadcast, he described the situation of visiting factories, rural areas, pastoral areas, various construction projects, schools, hospitals, workers' cultural palaces, parks, nurseries, and visiting scenic spots and historical sites in various places, and described the gradual improvement of people's lives and the protection of temples and respect for freedom of religious belief in various places. He said that we saw the industrial construction projects in various places, saw the great cause of building a new society, and felt that our motherland could indeed be built into a strong industrial country relatively quickly. We saw the boundless farmland, and the farmers were all diligently cultivating. On the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia and the Northwest region, the water and grass were lush, and the people's government helped the herders of all ethnic groups protect pastures, prevent animal epidemics, improve livestock breeds, and establish mutual aid groups, which greatly developed animal husbandry. Herders who had no livestock in the past now mostly have livestock.

Under the illumination of Chairman Mao's great national policy, all ethnic minorities have gained equal rights, and dozens of ethnic autonomous regions have been established throughout the country. We visited the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region, the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province. Most of the cadres in these autonomous regions are from their own ethnic groups, and they use their own languages and scripts to work. Close unity has been established among all ethnic groups in the autonomous regions, and politics, economy, and culture have also developed. In the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, many people used to live in poor mountainous areas and lived a very hard life. Now, the people in the mountainous areas have moved to the plains area, and with the help of the Han people, they have built new houses, divided the land, and participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and have begun to live a happy life. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the people in the pastoral areas have added new yurts and daily necessities. One night, our observation group stayed in the Ama Guole pastoral area of the New Barag Right Banner and saw with our own eyes that the herder Dengzhu's family had 300 sheep, 26 horses, and 113 cattle. The quality of their yurt's utensils, clothing, bedding, etc. was very good, and they warmly entertained us with abundant food.

Regarding religious belief, freedom of religious belief is a policy stipulated by the People's Government. We saw that the land and incense income of each temple were still maintained as before. For example, the income of the Ta'er Monastery monks had not changed. According to the resolution of the Chinese Buddhist Association last year, believers should love the country, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, and actively shoulder the responsibility of defending world peace.

Dorje Phuntsog Rabgye finally broadcast that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups have embarked on the road to prosperity and happiness and are living a happy life. In Tibet, in the future, we should strengthen the unity of the Tibetan people, actively develop production and various construction undertakings, love the motherland, love the People's Government, and consolidate the southwest national defense of the motherland, in accordance with the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet. May all beings live happily, and may the world be forever peaceful. (Xinhua News Agency)

     西藏国庆观礼团团长朵噶·彭错饶杰
     向西藏僧俗官员、人民广播
     西藏国庆观礼团团长朵噶·彭错饶杰二十五日到二十七日在中央人民广播电台用藏语向西藏僧俗官员、人民广播。他讲述了观礼团参加一九五三年国庆节观礼、向中央人民政府毛泽东主席致敬以及参观祖国各地的情况和感想。
    他首先说：去年达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏地方政府派我们僧俗官员、西藏四大寺的活佛堪布等参加我们祖国大家庭的国庆大典、并向各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席以及各首长致敬。从拉萨出发后，沿途受到各地政府、各兄弟民族代表等的招待和帮助。九月二十八日到达庄严伟大的首都时，受到中央人民政府委员会秘书长林伯渠、政务院秘书长习仲勋、民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉等各机关首长、各界代表的欢迎。二十九日政务院设宴招待，副总理邓小平给我们作了指示。十月一日，我们参加国庆节观礼。在雄伟的天安门上，有我们各民族的幸福太阳伟大的毛主席为首的中央人民政府各首长。游行开始，在我们面前出现了保卫祖国的强大步兵、骑兵、海军、空军等英雄部队和飞机、坦克等各种现代化武器，我们亲眼看到了祖国国防的力量，更增强了我们的信心。我们还看见工人、农民、学生、市民等共约四十多万人的行列，他们都拿着鲜花和旗帜前进，大家一致欢呼“毛主席万岁”，“中国共产党万岁”，声音如雷震动。人们都流露着对伟大领袖毛主席的真诚热爱和敬意。五日我们西藏、昌都、四川等藏族观礼团的正副团长又听了中央民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉关于加强民族团结的指示，并参加了宴会。六日我们应邀赴朱德总司令的宴会。十四日我们全体团员应邀出席了中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会举行的座谈会。
    他接着广播了向毛主席致敬的情况。他说，十月十八日，我们各个藏族观礼团、参观团等的正副团长同去向毛主席和朱总司令致敬，并呈献达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和西藏地方政府的礼品。毛主席和我们谈了一个半小时。毛主席深切地关怀着西藏和西藏人民，他对我们的到来，表示欢迎。并给我们作了许多宝贵明确的指示。
    主席指示说：我们要和各民族讲团结，不论大的民族小的民族都要团结。例如鄂伦春族还不到两千人，我们也要和他们团结。只要是中国人，不分民族，凡是反对帝国主义、主张爱国和团结的，我们都要和他们团结。团结起来，按照各民族不同地区的不同情况进行工作。有些地方可以做得快一点，有些地方可以做得慢一点，不论做快做慢都要先商量好了再做，没有商量好就不勉强做。商量好了，大多数人赞成了，就慢慢地去做。做好事也要商量着做。商量办事，这是共产党和国民党不同的地方。国民党势力大就压迫人。他们不仅压迫少数民族，还压迫大多数汉人。国民党是做坏事的。坏事是不应当做的，我们的干部有了错误就要批评。我们在西藏的工作有什么缺点和错误，请你们讲，你们不同意的和你们认为不利于人民的都可以讲，便于我们纠正。有了缺点就马上纠正，这是我们和国民党不同的地方。
    主席说，过去两年来，中央人民政府和西藏地方之间的相互了解以及汉藏两个民族之间的相互了解是有进步的，西藏地方对中央以及藏族和汉族之间都是一天一天靠拢的，相信将来会更加靠拢。
    主席又指示说：整个中国现在还很落后，需要发展。这是因为过去有帝国主义和国民党压迫的关系。他们现在已被我们赶走了，这四年来我们就有很大进步。在国家经济恢复以后，今年开始了第一个国家建设的五年计划，预计在三个五年计划以后，我们的大工业就建立起来了。苏联在三十六年前赶走了帝国主义和国内的坏人，建设了三十六年才有现在的成绩。我们建设起来比苏联还要快些。因为我们有苏联的帮助。中国人口很多，有五万万几千万，是全世界人口最多的国家，土地也很广大，有三个五年计划就能建设得很好了，对西藏就会有更大的帮助了。
    主席说：中央有什么东西可以帮助你们的一定会帮助你们。帮助各少数民族，让各少数民族得到发展和进步，是整个国家的利益。各少数民族的发展和进步都是有希望的。
    主席指示说：西藏政治、经济、文化、宗教的发展，主要靠西藏的领袖和人民自己商量去做，中央只是帮助。这点是在和平解放西藏办法的协议里写了的。但是要做，还得一个时间，而且要根据你们的志愿逐步地做。可做就做，不可做就等一等；能做的，大多数人同意了的，不做也不好。可以做得慢一些，让大家都高兴，这样反而就快了。
    主席最后指示说：总之，我们的方针是团结进步，更加发展。
    毛主席给我们的宝贵指示，使我们感到无限的兴奋和愉快。以上所说的只是我们记得的一些片断罢了。
    朵噶·彭错饶杰接着广播了参观祖国各地的观感。他说中央人民政府给我们特派专车和工作干部、医务人员等前往西北区的西安、兰州、西宁、塔尔寺、甘南藏族自治区的拉卜楞，东北区的沈阳、抚顺、哈尔滨、旅大、长春、延边朝鲜族自治区，内蒙古自治区的海拉尔，华东区的上海、南京、佛子岭、杭州，中南区的武汉、广州、桂西僮族自治区，以及天津、北京等地参观，参观时间共约六个月。参观期间承蒙各地党、政首长，各阶层各民族的代表热烈迎送，给我们很多帮助和指导。我们已看到祖国大家庭各民族间的平等、友爱、团结的新气象，心里有说不出的愉快。
    他在广播中叙述了在各地参观工厂、农村、牧区、各项建设工程、学校、医院、工人文化宫、公园、托儿所和游览名胜古迹的情况，叙述了人民生活逐步改善以及各地保护寺庙、尊重宗教信仰自由的情况。他说，我们看到各地的工业建设工程，看见了建设新社会的伟大事业，感觉到我们祖国确实可以较迅速地建成强大的工业国家。我们看到了一望无涯的农田，农民们都在辛勤耕植。在内蒙古和西北区的辽阔草原上，水草肥美，人民政府帮助各族牧民保护牧场、防治兽疫、改良畜种、建立互助组等措施，使畜牧业得到很大发展，过去没有牲畜的牧民现在大都有了牲畜。
    在毛主席伟大民族政策的照耀下，各少数民族得到平等权利，全国已建立了几十个民族自治区。我们曾参观了西康省藏族自治区，甘南藏族自治区、内蒙古自治区、延边朝鲜族自治区和广西省桂西僮族自治区。这些自治区的干部大部分由本民族人担任，他们使用自己的语言文字进行工作。自治区内各民族建立了亲密的团结关系，政治、经济、文化也有了发展。在桂西僮族自治区，过去有很多人居住在贫困的山地，生活很苦，现在山区人民迁移到平坝地区，他们在汉族人民的帮助下，新建了房屋，分得了土地，还参加互助合作组织，已经开始过着幸福的生活了。在内蒙古自治区，牧区人民新添了蒙古包和日用器具。我们观礼团有一个夜晚住在新巴尔虎左翼旗的阿麻郭勒牧区，亲眼看见牧民邓珠家里有三百只羊、二十六匹马、一百十三头牛。他们的蒙古包里饮食用具、衣服被盖等质量都很好，他们热情的以丰美的食品招待我们。
    关于宗教信仰方面，宗教信仰自由是人民政府规定的政策。我们看见各寺院的土地、香火的收入仍照样保持，如塔尔寺僧众的供养收入都没有变更。依照去年中国佛教协会的决议，教徒们应该热爱国家，划清敌我界限，积极担负起保卫世界和平的责任。
    朵噶·彭错饶杰最后广播说，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，各民族人民都已走上繁荣幸福的道路，过着愉快的生活。在西藏，今后应根据和平解放西藏办法的协议，加强西藏民族的团结，积极发展生产及各项建设事业，热爱祖国，热爱人民政府，巩固祖国的西南国防。愿众生幸福生活，世界永远和平。（新华社）
