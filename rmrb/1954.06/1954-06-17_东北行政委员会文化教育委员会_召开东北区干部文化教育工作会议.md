The Northeast Administrative Committee Cultural and Educational Committee recently convened the Northeast Regional Cadre Cultural Education Work Conference. The conference affirmed the achievements of the Northeast region's cadre cultural education work since 1949, examined current shortcomings, and summarized past experiences.

Currently, organizations above the county level, some town and district organizations, and the vast majority of factories and mines in the Northeast region have organized cadre spare-time cultural learning activities. Over 220,000 cadres throughout the region are participating in learning. In recent years, a large number of worker and peasant cadres in the Northeast have improved their cultural level through learning, creating favorable conditions for studying political theory, delving into professional work, and improving work. Jiang Hongxiang of the Dalian Engineering Mining Wheel Factory, after learning, was able to conduct accounting for two different types of wood drying furnaces in the factory and could calculate the horsepower, traction, and friction of the locomotive. He felt he was able to master the equipment of the machine. Xie Baofeng, chief of the secretariat section of the Lishu County Cooperative Union in Liaoxi Province, could not write summaries and reports in the past. After three years of cultural learning, he could not only write but write well. His report on "Organizing to Develop Sideline Occupations" was circulated throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics from cultural supplementary schools in Songjiang, Anshan, and six other provinces and cities, as well as three cultural supplementary schools of Northeast first-level organizations, more than 26,000 cadres have completed the courses of higher primary and junior high schools.

In recent years, the Northeast has accumulated some experience in carrying out cadre cultural education: Wherever the leadership of the region and the unit attaches importance to and supports cadre cultural education, some difficulties and problems encountered in running schools (such as teachers, funding, and school running policies and objectives) can be resolved and improved in a timely manner. Therefore, leadership attention is the key to running cadre cultural education well. Localities should run cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools according to different situations, adopting methods such as self-run, joint-run by region and system, and attaching them to universities and middle schools. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the enthusiasm of various units in running schools should be fully utilized. To ensure the teaching quality of cadre spare-time cultural schools, relevant parties should also take various forms to organize teachers' further education, such as running worker-peasant spare-time normal schools, sending teachers to participate in ordinary middle school teachers' spare-time further education schools and correspondence colleges, and organizing teaching and research groups within schools. Cadre spare-time cultural schools should, according to the characteristics of worker and peasant cadres, "streamline teaching materials, focus on in-depth study," "link to reality, inspire thinking," and "consolidate in class, practice repeatedly" in teaching, in order to implement the "short-term and practical teaching policy."

The conference believes that future cadre cultural education work should further implement the "Directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Cadre Cultural Education Work" and continue to carry it out. The conference decided to strengthen the leadership of the current cadre cultural education work: First, it requires all localities to establish and improve special management agencies for cadre cultural education work at all levels under the unified leadership of the local Party Committee, and to divide labor and levels to do a good job in cadre cultural education work. Second, it is necessary to focus on running cadre spare-time cultural supplementary schools above the provincial and municipal levels and in certain factories and mining enterprises, and special attention should be paid to the cadre cultural education work of factories and mining enterprises. Regarding the shortage of teachers, all localities should actively "tap potential, strive to train, exchange what they have, and strive to take concurrent lessons" based on the principle of "self-reliance and local materials." At the same time, all localities should, under the unified leadership of the local Party Committee, organize all teachers to study Marxism-Leninism; and should obtain the assistance of local education administrative departments and organize all teachers to study teaching business in a planned way. Existing cadre spare-time cultural schools should clarify their school-running objectives, criticize the views of simply emphasizing learning culture for the purpose of entering school and emphasizing regularization in everything, as well as unilaterally emphasizing practicality. At the same time, it is necessary to strive for the participation of the majority of leading cadres from workers and peasants from all aspects with lower cultural levels in cultural learning. In addition, the conference further clarified the academic system and curriculum of cadre spare-time cultural schools; and also discussed and studied issues such as teaching materials and funding, and put forward solutions.

    东北行政委员会文化教育委员会
    召开东北区干部文化教育工作会议
    东北行政委员会文化教育委员会最近召开了东北区干部文化教育工作会议。会议肯定了从一九四九年以来东北区干部文化教育工作的成绩，检查了现在的缺点，总结了过去的经验。
    目前东北区县以上机关和一部分镇、区机关以及绝大部分厂矿都组织了干部业余文化学习，全区参加学习的干部已达二十二万多人。几年来东北大批工农干部已在学习中提高了文化水平，为学习政治理论、钻研业务和改进工作创造了有利条件。大连工矿车轮厂姜鸿祥经过学习后，能够对工厂里两种不同的木材干燥炉进行核算，能计算机车的马力、牵引力、磨擦力，自己感到能掌握机器的设备了。辽西省梨树县合作社联合社秘书科长谢宝封，过去不会写总结和报告，经过三年的文化学习后，他不但能写而且写得很好，他写的“组织起来，发展副业”的报告，曾被通报全省。据松江、鞍山等八个省、市的文化补习学校和东北一级机关的三个文化补习学校的不完全统计，已有两万六千多名干部分别学完了高小和初中的课程。
    几年来东北在开展干部文化教育中已积累了一些经验：凡是本地区和本单位的领导方面重视和支持干部文化教育的，在办学当中遇到的一些困难和问题（如师资、经费和办学方针、目的等）都能得到及时的解决和改进。因此领导重视是办好干部文化教育的关键。各地举办干部业余文化补习学校，应按不同情况，分别采取自办、按地区按系统联办、在大学、中学附设等办法；并应在党委领导下，充分发挥各单位办学的积极性。要保证干部业余文化学校教学质量，有关方面还要采取各种形式组织教师进修，如举办工农业余师范学校，送教师参加普通中学教师业余进修学校和参加函授学院，以及在学校内组织教研组等。干部业余文化学校根据工农干部的特点，在教学上要“精简教材，重点深入”、“联系实际，启发思考”，并要“当堂巩固，反复练习”，以贯彻“速成的和联系实际的教学方针”。
    会议认为今后的干部文化教育工作应进一步贯彻“中国共产党中央委员会关于加强干部文化教育工作的指示”，继续开展。会议决定加强对当前干部文化教育工作的领导：首先，要求各地在当地党委的统一领导下，建立和健全各级干部文化教育工作的专管机构，并分工分级做好干部文化教育工作。其次，要着重办好省、市以上和某些厂矿企业的干部业余文化补习学校，特别是对厂矿、企业的干部文化教育工作应十分重视。对师资缺乏问题，各地应本着“自力更生，就地取材”的原则，积极
  “挖掘潜力，努力培养，互通有无，力争兼课”。同时各地要在当地党委统一领导下，组织全体教师学习马克思列宁主义；并应取得地方教育行政部门的帮助，有计划地组织全体教师学习教学业务。现有的干部业余文化学校应明确办学目的，批判单纯强调学文化为了升学和一切强调正规化以及片面强调实用的观点，同时一定要争取多数文化水平较低的工农出身的各方面的领导干部参加文化学习。此外，会议还进一步明确了干部业余文化学校的学制和课程；并对教材、经费等问题也作了讨论和研究，提出了解决意见。　（新华社）
