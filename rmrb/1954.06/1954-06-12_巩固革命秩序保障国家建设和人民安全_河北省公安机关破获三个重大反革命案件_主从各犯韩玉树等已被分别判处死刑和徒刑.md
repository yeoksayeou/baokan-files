To consolidate revolutionary order, safeguard national construction and the people's security, the Hebei Provincial Public Security Organs recently cracked three major counter-revolutionary cases involving disruption of social order and conspiracies to carry out riots. Fifty bandits, including the principal and accessory criminals in the three cases, Han Yushu and others, were arrested. After careful interrogation by the Hebei Provincial People's Court, the criminals were sentenced to death, death with a two-year reprieve, and imprisonment, respectively, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries." The sentences were immediately carried out after public trials held in Gu'an, Anguo, Wanquan, and Liangxiang counties, attended by a total of more than 40,000 people.

The first of these three counter-revolutionary cases was the armed robbery gang led by Han Yushu. Most of the gang members were fugitives who had committed counter-revolutionary murders, and reactionary landlords and rich peasants. The gang consisted of twenty bandits, all close relatives of Han Yushu and subordinates during his time as a puppet soldier. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, the gang leaders Han Yushu and his brother Han Yuhua had organized reactionary landlord armed forces. Han Yushu also served as the captain of the "Standing Team" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Gu'an and Yongqing counties and the commander of the notorious Wang Fenggang bandit unit. They frantically carried out "counter-attacks" and "reverse liquidations" in the Gu'an, Xincheng, and Zhuoxian areas, brutally killing the people. According to verified information, Han Yushu and other bandits personally shot and buried alive nineteen district village cadres and civilians. The family of Han Dexiu and Han Derui, farmers in Fangcheng Village, Gu'an County, consisting of seven people, were all killed by the Han bandit brothers in one go. The local people hated them to the bone, calling them the "Black Killing Gang." After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, Han Yushu and other bandits hid their weapons and fled. In 1950, they secretly returned to their hometown and gathered remnants of enemy and puppet elements such as Liu Changgeng, Chen Qingyu, and Han's close relatives Ji Bao'an, Ji Guangze, Lu Shuyu, and Han's sons and nephews Han Yongren, Han Yongliang, and Han Yongnian. They formed armed gangs, robbed everywhere, disrupted revolutionary order, and endangered the people's safety. This group of counter-revolutionary bandits frequently roamed between the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, and seventeen counties including Gu'an, Xincheng, Zhuoxian, Wuqing, Yongqing, Anci, Liangxiang, Zhangbei, Wanquan, Shangdu, and Kangbao. Over four years, they committed a total of forty-five robberies, with a large number of stolen goods and victims. In July and August 1950, they even robbed horse-drawn carts twice in broad daylight in Xiaohongmen Village, a suburb of Beijing. In October 1953, they robbed five bicycles belonging to cadres from a certain agency on the Dou (dian) Jiao (dou) highway in broad daylight. When robbing, the bandits often impersonated state personnel to undermine the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government. For example, in the spring of 1953, Han Yushu impersonated cadres from a local tax bureau and public security bureau in Xincheng County, robbing over ten million yuan from procurement personnel of the Beijing Geological Institute who were buying pigs. On the night of October 12 of the same year, Han Yuhua and other bandits fled to Ligezhuang Village in Xincheng County and also impersonated public security cadres. They opened the door of Zhang Yonghai's house under the pretext of checking household registrations, tied him up, and stole three million yuan, the proceeds from selling livestock. According to the bandits' confessions and incomplete investigations, from 1950 to the end of 1953, they robbed a total of seven rubber-wheeled carts, ten head of livestock, thirty bicycles, three hundred and forty-five bolts of various fabrics, thirty-four yards of velvet, forty-two dozen towels, over seventy million yuan in cash, and countless other materials such as clothing, watches, and fountain pens. The destructive activities of this group of counter-revolutionary bandits were carried out in collusion with landlords, old rich peasants, and puppet personnel who persisted in their reactionary stance. For example, reactionary landlord Li Yongchun in Jiuyangtun Village, Wanquan County, reactionary landlord Cheng Wentang in Chengjiazhuang Village, Daxing County, and puppet personnel Lu Zhanchun, Du Chuanyi, and Wang Linshan consistently dug caves to shelter bandits, stored guns for them, scouted robbery targets, "cased" locations (provided information), delivered food to the bandits hiding underground, aided the bandits in their evil deeds, and divided the spoils on the spot. Cheng Wentang also sent money and grain to the Han bandits in Beijing, Gu'an, and other places. Wang Linshan also reported the weapons situation of the militia to the Han bandits and plotted to seize the guns of our militia. Bandit Ji Guangze infiltrated our grassroots organizations, served as the deputy captain of the militia, and secretly colluded with other bandits in robberies. Enemy and puppet element Chen Qingyu used methods such as purchasing goods on behalf of others, partnering in business, and hosting banquets to win over our rural cadres and Communist Party members, to directly and indirectly manipulate our grassroots organizations, making it easier for them to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities. In areas where this group of counter-revolutionary bandits was rampant, such as the joint area of Gu'an, Xincheng, and Zhuoxian counties, the people could not concentrate on production because they were often harassed by the bandits. Some farmers were therefore afraid to join mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives were also afraid to go to the countryside with goods.

The second case was the organization of the reactionary armed force "Hebei Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" by the fugitive counter-revolutionary Yang Bingli to conspire to carry out riots. Yang Bingli was originally a company commander in Wang Fenggang's bandit unit and had previously captured and killed our cadres in Shijiu Fa Village, Xincheng County, and Shigezhuang Village, Gu'an County, as well as Zhang Weishu, Li Furong, and other activists in the land reform movement, totaling five people. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, Yang fled in fear of punishment but continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In October 1949, he accepted orders from the major counter-revolutionary bandits Yuan Shilong and Fan Shulin in Guihua City (now called Hohhot) to establish the reactionary armed force "Hebei Anti-Communist National Salvation Army." He appointed himself the commander of the detachment. After the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, Yang believed that "the time had come" and actively plotted counter-revolutionary activities with bandits such as Zhang Baochen, Xu Wenshan, Yang Shan, Wang Yongsheng, and Lang Xijiu. In 1951, this group of bandits secretly gathered in Beihai Park in Beijing and agreed on a plan to "strictly maintain secrecy, actively develop the organization, and seize militia guns." Later, the bandits actively developed organizations in our grassroots governments and industrial, mining, financial, and construction departments, and dispatched inside lines. Bandits Li Fengchen, Zhang Shirong, Zhu Zhenyu, Lang Xijiu, Li Fuzeng, and others successively infiltrated the Communist Party branches, township people's governments, and militia teams in Xiaoma Village, Zhu Village, and Mafang Village in Gu'an County, and other organizations, and defrauded cadre positions. Xu Wenshan, a reactionary rich peasant in Yaoqiying Village, Xincheng County, opened Wentaiyong Coal Shop in Beijing to solve the operating expenses for Yang and other bandits to develop reactionary organizations, serving as Yang's "quartermaster." In 1952 and 1953, this group of counter-revolutionary bandits secretly gathered several times, conspiring to launch armed riots. For example, Yang Bingli ordered bandits Zhang Baochen, Zhang Shirong, and others to seize the guns of the militia in eleven villages, including Xiaofeng Village, Yangjiatun, Gaozhuang, and Lijiaying in Gu'an County, and planned to rob the funds for the construction of the Gu'an Bridge. They also frequently and systematically fabricated rumors to undermine the various work of the People's Government. In November and December 1953, they fabricated shameless lies to undermine the state's grain procurement work.

The third case was the destruction and theft of power lines by the reactionary landlord Jiang Rongjia and others in Anguo County. Jiang Rongjia came from a reactionary landlord class and had served as a puppet policeman and an adjutant in the Chiang Kai-shek army. He had been captured twice by our People's Liberation Army, but both times he fled in fear of punishment. After the national liberation, the criminal not only refused to admit his guilt and repent, but also refused to register with the People's Government and went east and west, collecting henchmen and seeking opportunities to carry out sabotage activities. In 1950, the criminal colluded with and manipulated Shao Yushan, a gangster who had always stolen grain and trees from the masses and raped women, and other bad elements such as Zhao Dianyuan and others, specializing in disrupting national construction and endangering social security. According to preliminary statistics, from the spring of 1950 to the winter of 1953, they had successively damaged power lines twenty-five times around Anguo County, stealing a total of 1,164 jin of state power lines, which landlords Jiang Ronghu, Jiang Rongke, and illegal merchant Qi Xiaodan were responsible for reselling.

The detection and cracking of these three counter-revolutionary cases received the active assistance of the broad masses. For example, in the process of cracking the Han Yushu bandit case, Wang Ziping of the Daxing County Public Security Team discovered two people driving a mule cart on the road, one of which had a bald-tailed mule. He recalled that the cart that had been robbed in the suburbs of Beijing a few days ago also had a bald-tailed mule, and immediately reported it to the County Public Security Bureau. Finally, Chen Qingyu, one of the criminals in the case, was arrested, and Han Yongliang, who resisted arrest with a gun, was shot dead on the spot. Another bandit, Ji Guangze, fled to Pancun Village in Anci County and was discovered that night by Wang Xiuying, a woman from the village. She and militiaman Qiao Ziqi and others immediately assisted the public security personnel in arresting the criminal. When pursuing the remaining criminals in the case, the militia in Huairou County actively led the way for the public security personnel. The boatmen at the Yongding River ferry crossing in Shili Pu, Gu'an County, regardless of day or night and the cold weather, rescued public security personnel more than 200 times. The active assistance of the people enabled the People's Public Security Organs to arrest all twenty bandits, who had fled within a radius of four or five hundred miles, within half a month.

During the trials of the above three cases, the criminals could not deny their crimes in the face of conclusive evidence and confessed to all their crimes. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and social order, protect the safety of the people's lives and property and the cause of national construction, the Hebei Provincial People's Court, in accordance with the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries," sentenced the counter-revolutionaries Han Yushu, Han Yuhua, Ji Bao'an, Ji Guangze, Han Yongren, Chen Qingyu, Liu Changgeng, Lu Zhanchun, Li Yongchun, Cheng Wentang, Du Chuanyi, Wang Linshan, Yang Bingli, Zhang Baochen, Xu Wenshan, Yang Shan, Lang Xijiu, Wang Yongsheng, Jiang Rongjia, and Shao Yushan to death, and they were executed by shooting after public trials held in Gu'an, Anguo, Wanquan, Liangxiang, and other counties in late February. The other criminals with lighter crimes were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and imprisonment, respectively.

The cracking and handling of these three cases were warmly supported by the broad masses of the people. The political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses in Gu'an and other counties, which were deeply harmed by these bandits, are now unprecedentedly high.

    巩固革命秩序保障国家建设和人民安全
    河北省公安机关破获三个重大反革命案件
    主从各犯韩玉树等已被分别判处死刑和徒刑
    河北省人民公安机关在最近连续破获了三起扰乱社会治安、阴谋进行暴乱的重大反革命案件，逮捕了三案的主从各犯韩玉树等五十名匪徒。河北省人民法院经过细密审讯后，根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，分别判处各犯以死刑、死刑缓期二年执行和有期徒刑，并已在固安、安国、万全、良乡等县召开的共有四万多人参加的公审大会后立即执行。
    这三个反革命案件中的第一案，是以韩玉树为首的伙匪抢劫案。这股伙匪大部分是逃亡的反革命杀人犯和反动的地主、富农等纠集起来的，共有匪徒二十人，都是韩玉树的近亲及其充任匪伪军时期的部属。在抗日战争时期和人民解放战争时期，匪首韩玉树、韩玉华兄弟两人就曾组织过反动的地主武装；韩玉树还担任过固安、永清两县的蒋匪“常备队”中队长和恶名昭著的王凤岗匪部的连长。他们在固安、新城、涿县一带疯狂地进行“反攻”“倒算”，残杀人民。据已查清的，仅韩玉树等匪犯就曾亲手枪杀、活埋我区村干部和群众十九人。固安县方城村农民韩德修、韩德瑞一家七口，被韩匪兄弟一次杀光。当地群众恨之入骨，称之为“黑杀团”。北京、天津解放后，韩玉树等匪匿枪潜逃，又于一九五○年先后秘密回乡，纠集了敌伪残余分子刘长庚、陈庆余和韩匪近亲季保安、季广泽、鲁书玉和韩匪的儿子、侄儿韩永仁、韩永良、韩永年等，持枪结伙，四出抢劫，破坏革命秩序，危害人民安全。这股反革命匪徒经常流窜于北京、天津、张家口三市之间和固安、新城、涿县、武清、永清、安次、良乡、张北、万全、商都、康保等十七县之间。四年来，他们共抢劫四十五次，抢劫的财物和受害的群众为数很多。一九五○年七、八月间，他们竟在北京市郊小红门村白昼抢劫大车两次。一九五三年十月间，又在窦（店）交（斗）公路上白昼抢去我某机关干部五人的自行车。匪徒们在行劫时往往冒充我国家工作人员，以破坏共产党和人民政府的威信。如一九五三年春天，韩玉树就曾冒充我某地税务局、公安局的干部，在新城县抢劫了北京地质学院采买人员的买猪款一千多万元。同年十月十二日夜，韩玉华等匪流窜到新城县李各庄，也曾冒充我公安干部，以查户口为名，叫开张永海家的门，把他绑起，抢走了他家卖牲口所得的款三百万元。仅据匪徒们的供词和不完全的调查统计，从一九五○年到一九五三年年底，他们共抢劫了胶皮轮大车七辆、牲口十头、自行车三十辆、各种布疋三百四十五疋、绒三十四码、毛巾四十二打、现款七千多万元，衣物、手表、钢笔等其他物资无算。这股反革命匪徒的破坏活动，是和坚持反动立场的地主、旧富农及匪伪人员勾结起来进行的。如万全县旧羊屯村反动地主李永春、大兴县程家庄反动地主程文堂和匪伪人员鲁占春、杜川义、王林山等，就
  一贯挖洞窝匪，为匪存枪、拉线（物色抢劫对象）、
  “踩线”（通风报信），给躲在地里的匪徒送饭，助匪为恶，就地分赃。程文堂还给韩匪往北京、固安等地送过钱和粮食。王林山还向韩匪报告过民兵的武器情况，策划夺取我民兵的枪枝。季匪广泽则混入我基层组织，充当民兵副队长，暗中与其他匪徒合伙抢劫。敌伪分子陈庆余则以代购东西、合伙做生意以及请客吃饭等方法拉拢我农村干部和共产党员，以直接间接操纵我基层组织，更加便于他们进行反革命破坏活动。在这股反革命匪徒活动猖獗的地区，如固安、新城和涿县三县结合地带，人民群众因经常受到匪徒们的骚扰，不能安心生产。有些农民因此不敢参加互助组和农业生产合作社。有的供销合作社的工作人员也因此不敢带货下乡。
    第二案是以逃亡反革命分子杨秉礼为首组织反动武装“河北省反共建国军”阴谋进行暴乱案。杨秉礼原是王凤岗匪部的连长，曾先后捕杀我新城县十九垡村、固安县石各庄村干部和土地改革运动中的积极分子张维书、李福荣等五人。北京、天津解放以后，杨匪畏罪潜逃，但仍继续进行反革命活动。一九四九年十月间，他在归绥市（现称呼和浩特）接受华北反革命巨匪袁世隆、樊树林的命令，成立了反动武装“河北省反共建国军”。自任支队司令。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争后，杨匪认为“时机已到”，就和张保臣、徐文山、杨山、王永生、郎喜九等匪徒积极策划进行反革命活动。一九五一年，这批匪徒在北京北海公园秘密聚会，议订了“严格保守秘密，积极发展组织，夺取民兵枪枝”的计划。以后，匪徒们就积极地在我基层政权和工矿、财经、建筑等部门中发展组织，派遣内线。匪徒李凤臣、张世荣、朱振玉、郎喜九、李福增等曾先后混入固安县小马村、朱村和马坊村的中共支部、乡人民政府和民兵队等组织内，骗取了干部职位。新城县姚其营村的反动富农徐文山，为解决杨匪等发展反动组织的活动经费，在北京开设了文泰永煤铺，充任杨匪的“军需官”。一九五二年和一九五三年，这批反革命匪徒曾数次秘密聚会，阴谋举行武装暴乱。如杨匪秉礼就曾命令张保臣、张世荣等匪徒夺取我固安县小冯村、杨家屯、高庄、李家营等十一个村的民兵的枪枝，并计划抢劫我兴修固安大桥的粮款。他们还经常有计划地制造谣言，以破坏人民政府的各项工作。在一九五三年十一、十二月间就曾制造无耻谰言，破坏国家的粮食收购工作。
    第三案是以安国县反动地主姜荣嘉等为首的破坏盗窃电线案。姜荣嘉出身反动地主阶级，曾充任伪警察和蒋匪军的副官，曾两次为我人民解放军俘掳，均畏罪潜逃。全国解放后，该犯不但不低头认罪，痛改前非，反而拒绝向人民政府登记，并东走西串，搜罗爪牙，寻隙进行破坏活动。一九五○年，该犯拉拢和操纵一贯盗窃群众粮食、树木和强奸妇女的流氓邵玉山及其他坏分子赵殿元等七人，专门扰乱国家建设和危害社会治安。据初步统计，从一九五○年春到一九五三年冬，他们曾先后在安国县周围破坏电线二十五次，共盗窃国家电线一千一百六十四斤，由地主姜荣虎、姜荣科和不法商人齐小旦等负责转销赃物。
    这三个反革命案件的侦察和破获，曾得到广大群众的积极协助。如在破获韩匪玉树案件的过程中，大兴县公安队王子平在路上发现有两个人赶着一辆骡车，其中有一秃尾巴骡，就想起前日京郊被劫走的大车也有一秃尾巴骡，立即报告了县公安局，终于将该案犯罪分子之一的陈匪庆余捕获，将鸣枪拒捕的韩匪永良当场击毙。另一匪徒季广泽逃到安次县潘村，当晚就为该村妇女王秀英发觉。她和民兵乔子岐等立即协助公安人员将该犯逮捕起来。在追捕该案其余各犯时，怀柔县的民兵积极地为公安人员带路；固安县十里铺永定河渡口的船工们更不分日夜，不顾天寒地冻，抢渡公安人员二百多次。人民群众的积极协助，使人民公安机关得以在半个月内将逃窜在方圆四、五百里以内的二十名匪犯一一逮捕归案。
    在上述三案的审讯中，各犯在确凿的证据面前无可抵赖，全部供认了他们的罪行。河北省人民法院为了巩固人民民主专政和社会秩序，保护人民生命财产的安全和国家的建设事业，根据“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”，判处罪大恶极的反革命分子韩玉树、韩玉华、季保安、季广泽、韩永仁、陈庆余、刘长庚、鲁占春、李永春、程文堂、杜川义、王林山、杨秉礼、张保臣、徐文山、杨山、郎喜九、王永生、姜荣嘉、邵玉山以死刑，于二月底分别在固安、安国、万全、良乡等县的群众公审大会后执行枪决。其余罪恶较轻的各犯，被分别判处死刑缓期二年执行和有期徒刑。
    这三个案件的破获和处理，获得了广大人民群众的热烈拥护。受这批匪徒危害较深的固安等县的群众，现在政治热情和生产积极性空前高涨。
