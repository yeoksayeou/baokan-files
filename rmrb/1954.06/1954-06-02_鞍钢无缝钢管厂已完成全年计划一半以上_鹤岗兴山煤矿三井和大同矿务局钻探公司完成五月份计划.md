    Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant Completes Over Half of Annual Plan
    Hegang Xingshan Coal Mine No. 3 Well and Datong Mining Bureau Drilling Company Complete May Plan
    [Our Newspaper] By May 28th, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant had completed 51.8% of the year's national production plan. The Seamless Steel Tube Plant also completed its May production plan three days ahead of schedule. The quality of the seamless steel tubes produced in May was improved compared to the past, with first-class products reaching over 92%.
    [Another News Item] Hegang Xingshan Coal Mine's No. 3 Well comprehensively completed the May national production plan nine days ahead of schedule on May 21st, and will be able to overproduce 8,000 tons of coal for the country by the end of the month. All employees of No. 3 Well made preparations for various production tasks in May in late April, launched a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content, and vigorously promoted advanced experiences. For example, in coal mining, the experience of Lu Wenping's standardized cyclic operation was promoted in the 141 coal mining workface, exceeding the daily plan every day; in tunneling, advanced experiences such as the "single double-section slotting method" were promoted, increasing the tunneling efficiency from an average advance of 1.5 meters per small shift to 2 meters.
    The Datong Mining Bureau Drilling Company overfulfilled the national drilling plan five days ahead of schedule, and eleven drilling teams completed their May drilling tasks before May 20th. The drilling quality greatly exceeded the national standards: the average coal core recovery rate reached 80.34%, and the rock core recovery rate reached 87.05%.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂已完成全年计划一半以上
    鹤岗兴山煤矿三井和大同矿务局钻探公司完成五月份计划
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂到五月二十八日，已完成全年国家生产计划百分之五十一点八。无缝钢管厂五月份的生产计划也提前三天完成。五月份生产的无缝钢管的质量比过去提高，一级品已达到百分之九十二以上。
    【又讯】鹤岗兴山煤矿第三井，在五月二十一日提前九天全面完成了五月份的国家生产计划，到月底可再给国家超产八千吨煤。第三井全体职工在四月下旬就作好了五月各项生产准备工作，开展了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛，大力推广了先进经验。例如采煤方面，在一四一采煤场子里推广了吕文平的正规循环作业经验，天天超额完成日计划；掘进方面，推广了“单一双段掏槽法”等先进经验，使掘进效率由一小班一遍炮平均前进一点五公尺提高到二公尺。
    大同矿务局钻探公司提前五天超额完成了国家钻探计划，有十一个钻探小组在五月二十日以前就完成了五月份钻探任务。钻探质量大大地超过了国家规定指标：煤芯采取率平均达到百分之八十点三四，岩芯采取率达到百分之八十七点零五。
