	New Wheat from Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces Enters the Market
	New wheat has entered the market in Lanxi, Yiwu, Longyou, Qingtian, and Huangyan in Zhejiang Province, and Dangtu and Lu'an in Anhui Province. Local grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives are conducting purchases.
	Before the new wheat entered the market, Zhejiang and Anhui both carried out wheat pre-purchase work. Through pre-purchases, the grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions gained prior understanding of the quantity of wheat entering the market and other information, achieving "knowing the situation well." Therefore, they were able to make appropriate arrangements for purchasing manpower, equipment, storage capacity, funds, and supply materials in a timely manner. Farmers find it very convenient to sell wheat. (Cheng Hua)

    浙江安徽两省新小麦上市
    浙江省兰溪、义乌、龙游、青田、黄岩，安徽省当涂、六安等地新小麦已经上市，当地粮食部门和供销合作社正进行收购。
    新小麦上市以前，浙江、安徽都进行了小麦预购工作。通过预购，各地粮食部门和供销合作社预先了解了小麦上市的数量等情况，作到了“心中有数”，因而能及时对收购人力、器材、仓容、资金以及供应物资等作了适当安排。农民出售小麦，非常方便。（程华）
