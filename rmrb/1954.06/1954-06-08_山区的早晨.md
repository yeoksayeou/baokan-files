On May 7th, just as dawn broke, the rhythmic sound of stone mortars echoed through Yangjiayuan Village, the highest point of Gaobaibang Township in the Miao and Bouyei Joint Autonomous Region of Huishui County, Guizhou Province. Diligent Miao women were pounding rice to prepare breakfast. The terraced fields were filled with water after the rain, and the path from the village to the fields was quiet, with no new footprints or hoof marks yet visible. The morning mist was thick, and the peaks lower than the village were shrouded in dense fog, making them invisible.

Yang Wangme, who had just joined the Yanglaoqiao mutual aid team two or three days earlier, eagerly led his ox early in the morning to participate in his first collective labor, plowing the fields for team member Yang Guangzong. However, at the designated work site, two people were already plowing: the young mutual aid team leader Yang Laoqiao and his younger brother. Yang Laowu, another team member, had originally planned to go to the market this morning, but then thought it was more important to get everyone's work done first, so he arrived earlier than the other members. Even more surprising was that Yang Laowan, whose instep was in pain, also walked along the slippery field ridge. When he reached the edge of the field, some team members advised him to go home and rest, but he replied that he would plow the team's fields first.

Before long, all seven Miao team members had arrived. In the large field east of the village, Yang Guangzong led the way, pulling his large ox that resembled a camel, guiding six oxen and iron plows to turn over the soil, then harrowing the field evenly and cleanly. Twelve-year-old team member Yang Lei Si, who was not even as tall as the ox, rolled up his pants high and plowed back and forth across the field with a young ox that was just learning to plow. The team members worked happily, plowing deeply and harrowing evenly, as diligently as if they were working on their own fields. Although Yang Laowan plowed more slowly, he carefully picked up every blade of grass and stone in the field and threw them onto the field ridge. In less than an hour, they completed one plowing and one harrowing.

While the male team members were plowing, the female team members bent over to repair the field ridges, some shoveling grass and others reinforcing them, to prevent a single drop of water from being wasted.

The sun shone through the thick fog onto this mountainous area, more than 1,800 meters above sea level, and it was almost ten o'clock. After the mutual aid team finished plowing three mu and harrowing five mu, they went home for breakfast. On the way home, veteran team member Yang Laowan said contentedly to his companions, speaking from the heart: Two months ago, I thought the mountains of Gaobaibang were high, the water was cold, and the fields were scattered, and I was afraid that joining the mutual aid team would not lead to good production. Now it seems that there can only be good days in the mountains by taking the path of mutual aid and cooperation.

    山区的早晨
    新华社记者　刘扬深　杨炫之
    五月七日，天刚亮，贵州省惠水县苗族布依族联合自治区高摆塝乡的最高处杨家园村回荡着有节奏的石碓声，勤劳的苗家妇女正在舂米准备做早饭。雨后的梯田都积满了水，村子通往田野的路上静悄悄的，还没有出现新的人脚印和牛蹄迹。晨雾迷蒙，比这村子矮的一些山峰被浓雾笼罩得看不见了。
    两三天前才参加杨老桥互助组的组员杨望么，清早就拉着牛赶去参加第一次集体劳动，给组员杨光宗家犁田。可是在预定的工作地点，早已有两个人在犁田了，那就是年青的互助组长杨老桥和他的弟弟。组员杨老五原来打算今早下山去赶场，后来想到还是先做好大家的活路要紧，他也比别的组员早到了。更使大家奇怪的是：脚背正在痛的杨老万也从那滑溜溜的田坎路上走来了，当他走到田边时，有的组员劝他回家休息，他回答说先把组里的田犁了再说。
    不一会，七户苗族组员们都来齐了。在村子东边的那块大田里，杨光宗拉着自己那头像骆驼似的大牯牛走在最前面，领着六头牛、拖着铁犁把泥土翻了起来，接着，把田耙得匀匀净净的。十二岁的组员杨累四，人还没有牛高，也把裤子卷得高高的，拉着一头才学耕田的小牛在田里犁过来又犁过去。组员们愉快地耕作着，犁得深，耙得平，和做自己的活路一样认真。杨老万虽然犁得慢些，但他却仔细地把田里的一草一石拾起扔在田坎上。不到一个钟头，就完成了一犁一耙。
    当男组员犁田的时候，女组员们便弯着腰在整修田坎，有的铲草，有的加固，不使田里有一滴水浪费。
    太阳透过浓雾射到这拔海一千八百多公尺的山区，已将近十点钟了。互助组完成犁三亩耙五亩的工作以后，回家吃早饭。在回家的路上，老组员杨老万满意地向他的同伴们说出心头话：两个月前我还以为高摆塝的山高水冷，田土分散，参加互助组怕搞不好生产。现在看来，山里头也只有走互助合作的路才有好日子过。
