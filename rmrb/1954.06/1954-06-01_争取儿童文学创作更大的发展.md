As a children's literature worker, I am delighted to see that over the past four years, our ranks have gradually expanded, and excellent works loved by children have emerged one after another. Those inferior and even harmful children's books, unable to withstand the test of time, have been eliminated like flies in winter, only able to burrow into inaccessible corners. What is even more gratifying for us is that those excellent children's literature works have had a significant educational effect on children. Although the number of such works is not large, the role they play in cultivating and educating the new generation is significant. Luo Wenyin in Zhang Tianyi's "The Story of Luo Wenyin" has become a familiar friend to children because Luo Wenyin's shortcomings of being playful and lacking perseverance are precisely the shortcomings of many children. Luo Wenyin's perseverance in overcoming his shortcomings is also something children want to learn. Qin Zhaoyang's "The Story of Little Swallow's Ten Thousand Mile Flight" is a fairy tale loved by the majority of children. It makes children believe that as long as they have determination, any difficulty can be overcome, and it deepens children's love for the motherland. There are many concrete examples in this regard. Writers who are enthusiastic about writing for children are respected and loved by children, who write letters to writers with unparalleled enthusiasm and make friends with them. Children's literature has already laid a new foundation in children's ideological and cultural lives.

In children's newspapers and books, we can often find the names of new authors. Some of them are Young Pioneer instructors, some are teachers, and some are young people who love literature and art. Some of their works have played a certain role among children, such as Jiang Shanye's "Desk and Chair Committee Member," Zhao Zhennan's "Deskmate," Liu Zhen's "Good Kind Aunt," and other relatively successful works written by several new writers, which have given children great help in their studies and lives. They are familiar with children's lives and love this cause. At the same time, some writers who have been engaged in children's literature work for two or thirty years are now working even harder. They also value life, often meet with children, and care about children's studies and lives. This is completely different from the past creative methods of "shutting oneself in to write" or "drawing materials from newspapers."

Due to the expansion of the ranks of children's literature workers, the themes of children's literature creation have also become more extensive. In addition to writing about school life, there are writings about the lives of children in old revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. They have relatively successfully portrayed the images of strong and brave little heroes, such as "Commander Yang's Young Pioneers" and "Iron Doll"; there are reflections of the deep longing of children in old revolutionary base areas for their leaders, such as "The Sweet Water Well Dug by Chairman Mao"; there are introductions to the lives of children in ethnic minority areas fighting against the enemy, such as "Buckwheat and Geli Huang" and "Little Millet Xia"; there are also writings about the unfortunate experiences of the children of the American peace warriors the Rosenbergs, which aroused deep sympathy and concern among Chinese children, and have a high degree of internationalist significance, such as "Poem Sent to Toms River"; there are also adaptations of Chinese children's familiar folk tales into scripts, such as "The Big Bad Wolf" and "The Fruit Tree Sisters." Some excellent works published in recent years, despite some shortcomings, can indeed conduct moral education to children with new ideas and feelings, and guide our new generation towards a wider world.

Our work has achievements, but also many shortcomings. These shortcomings require us to make the greatest efforts to overcome them. From the perspective of the development path of children's literature creation, what we have done is only a new beginning. Our work, whether in terms of the quantity or quality of works, is still far from meeting the requirements of children.

I believe that a fundamental issue in children's literature creation is whether the author has a deep understanding of the current lives of children.

Some children's literature writers have created examples for us in this regard. They do often actively contact children, care about them, and love them. Therefore, they can vividly and concretely reflect the real lives of children and use this to educate the broad masses of children. These works are also loved by children. For example, Guo Xu's "Commander Yang's Young Pioneers" is a rare work describing children's participation in revolutionary struggles. The author writes about a Young Pioneer organization in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Those little heroes all have distinct personalities; they participate in battles like adults, but live their own lives as children, and their words and actions also express their own thoughts and feelings. The author successfully portrays Heigu, a brave, lively, and lovely Korean girl, giving readers an extremely profound infectious power. If the author is not familiar with the lives of these children, he would not be able to write such a good work. The children in Zhang Tianyi's "They and Us" also give people a sincere, lively, and lovely impression. When the author writes about some of the children's shortcomings, he does not make them seem like adults, as is generally written, but develops the conflicts reasonably and solves them. Everything is in accordance with the children's thoughts and feelings. I think this is the author's novel that best reflects the lively and vivid lives of children.

However, we also have a considerable number of works that have not yet jumped out of the circle of conceptualization and formulization. There are several reasons for this: one is that the author lacks understanding of children's lives, or the understanding is not deep enough, and cannot see the new qualities that are rapidly growing in children. When starting to write, they cannot find an image of a living child with excellent qualities in their minds; the second reason is that the author lacks research on children's education, and is not very clear about what should be used to educate children, but subjectively uses some moral concepts to put things together; the third reason is that the author's literary cultivation is poor and cannot express what he has experienced in his heart appropriately. These three reasons are interrelated, and for us, we need to strive to improve all three at the same time. Neglecting any one of them will not work. An instructor reflected on children's criticism of conceptualized and formulized works, saying that the children said, "When you read such books, you know the ending as soon as you read the beginning." They also said, "I can make up this kind of story." These opinions from the children are very sharp, but also very sincere and enthusiastic.

We are not familiar enough with the lives of children, and we do not understand the real thoughts and feelings of children enough. Therefore, we can only naturally preach to children from a positive perspective, but we will not write about the real lives of children through artistic images. However, the purpose of children's literature works is not to teach children a lesson, but mainly to naturally and kindly guide children to pay attention to what is good and what is bad, so that children are not forced to accept those boring and tedious "lessons," but bravely pursue the new and good things they need in their spiritual fields.

Because we have not delved into children's lives, we cannot master the characteristics of children's psychology skillfully and practically. In most of our works, the brave, lively, and energetic spirit of the new generation of the motherland has not been fully expressed. We cannot boldly write about the active, curious, bright, optimistic, and heroic characters of children, and often portray naughty children as domineering and rogue "negative characters," and write about children who study well and behave well as well-behaved and full of political terms "little cadres." This way of writing violates the real lives of children. Whether they are naughty or relatively good children, their real thoughts and feelings will never be like this. They have their common ground in terms of love to play and curiosity, because children are in a period of growth and development, which is a requirement for their physical and mental development. The difference is that some children can consciously demand progress, while others are too playful and do not pay enough attention to learning. Whether we write about naughty or excellent children, we should give readers a lively and lovely impression, and should not make people feel that those naughty children are annoying, and those excellent children are very "obedient." So far, we have not portrayed the lively and vigorous character of children who can represent this era in our works, nor have we shaped some of the most lovable children's typicals that already exist in real life. I think that as long as we can do it in a down-to-earth manner and truly serve the cultivation and education of children wholeheartedly, we will definitely have better achievements in this regard.

Children's literature writers should make friends with individual children and also go to the collective life of children to understand them, so that they can truly understand their thoughts and feelings and appreciate the growth of their new moral qualities. Because children are influenced by new influences as well as old influences at school and at home. The childhood lives of the writers themselves all came from the old society, and there is a great distance to understand the lives of today's children. Therefore, for us, it is even more necessary to deeply understand children's lives and to understand children's thoughts and feelings between the struggle between the new and the old. More importantly, children's literature writers themselves must have new moral qualities; if we ourselves do not first possess socialist ideas and feelings, how can we use socialist ideas and feelings to educate the next generation? Belinsky required children's literature writers to have certain intellectual and moral qualities, which are: vivid and remarkable imagination, understanding of children, love for children, and a childlike innocent character. He said: "There are people like this, they love the world of children very much, can tell stories to children, talk about the long and short, and can even play with children; he listens to their words very carefully, and treats them as friends with sincere trust." This paragraph is very important for us to understand children's lives, and such requirements are not excessive. To do this work well, in addition to deeply understanding children's lives, we must strengthen theoretical study and strive to improve artistic level. What we need to learn in literature is no different from ordinary writers, and we need to study child psychology and education even more. If we usually run to life and do not discover problems, it means that we do not have these basic conditions enough.

The narrowness of the circle of life of children's literature writers also affects the breadth of the subject matter. In addition to writing about children's learning life, we also need to write about children's lives outside the classroom, write about the friendship between children, write about children's lives at home, and write about the relationship between children and the adults around them. We can expand this circle and conduct socialist moral education to children in many ways. I think that the scope of our extraction of subject matter is very wide. Wherever there are children, there is our creative subject matter. We need to write about the lives of rural children, and we also need to write about the childhood lives of revolutionary leaders and heroes. We want to introduce the natural scenery and various knowledge of the motherland to children through stories or travel notes.

At present, the forms of our children's literature creation are not diverse enough, and what we lack most is drama and fairy tales. In fact, children like this type of work the most. The scripts that we can perform for children are really pitifully few. Children themselves want to perform a short play when they hold a team meeting or evening party, but they cannot find a script. Several children's drama troupes suffer every year from not being able to order a plan to perform a drama. We need to make good use of this form; fairy tales are a unique form in children's literature, and very few writers use this form. However, children love fairy tales so much. I have participated in several story meetings hosted by children themselves, and the most told and the most popular are fairy tales, and most of them are translated foreign fairy tales. There are not many folk tales that have been adapted and introduced to children. Fairy tales and folk tales of this kind that can inspire children's imagination and cultivate children's pure and beautiful feelings cannot be regarded as "unpopular" things. Good fairy tales and folk tales, like those works with real life as the theme, can also conduct moral and quality education to children.

In recent years, children have made very rapid progress, and new things are added to them every day. Although our children's literature creation has made some progress, it still lags behind the real lives of children from the perspective of children's requirements. Let us work harder and strive for greater development in children's literature creation, and contribute the greatest strength to the glorious and arduous task of cultivating socialist new people!

    争取儿童文学创作更大的发展
    金近
    作为一个儿童文学工作者，我欣喜地见到：四年多来，我们的队伍逐渐在扩大，为儿童所喜爱的优秀作品也陆续在出现。那些低劣的甚至有害的儿童读物，经不起时代的考验，已经被淘汰得像冬天的苍蝇一样，只能钻到找不着的角落里去。更值得我们高兴的是：那些优秀的儿童文学作品对儿童已起了显著的教育作用，这样的作品虽然为数不多，但对于培养和教育新生一代所起的作用是很大的。张天翼的“罗文应的故事”里的罗文应，已成为儿童所熟悉的朋友，因为罗文应的贪玩、缺乏坚持力的缺点，正是好多儿童身上的缺点，罗文应努力克服自己缺点的毅力，也正是儿童要想学习的地方。秦兆阳的“小燕子万里飞行记”，是为广大儿童所喜爱的一本童话，它使儿童相信，只要有决心什么困难都可以克服的，它加深了儿童热爱祖国的感情。这方面的具体例子是很多的。凡是热心为儿童写东西的作家，都受到儿童的尊敬和爱戴，他们以无比的热情给作家写信，和作家交朋友。儿童文学已经在儿童的思想和文化生活中打下一个新的基础。
    在儿童报刊和书籍上，我们常常可以发现新的作者的名字，他们有的是少年先锋队辅导员，有的是教师，也有的是爱好文艺的青年。他们有些作品在儿童中间起了一定的作用，如江山野的“桌椅委员”，赵镇南的“同桌”，刘真的“好大娘”，以及其他几位新作家所写的比较成功的作品，都给了儿童在学习上和生活上很大的帮助。他们熟悉儿童生活，并且热爱这个事业。同时，一些从事儿童文学工作已有二三十年历史的作家，现在也加倍努力地在工作着。他们也重视生活，经常和儿童见面，关心儿童的学习和生活，这和过去“闭门造车”或“读报取材”的创作方法完全不同了。
    由于儿童文学工作者队伍的扩大，儿童文学创作的题材也比较广泛了。除了写学校生活以外，有写抗日战争和解放战争时期老根据地的儿童生活的，他们比较成功地刻划出了坚强勇敢的小英雄的形象，如“杨司令的少先队”、“铁娃娃”等；有反映老根据地的儿童对领袖深深盼念的感情的，如“毛主席开的甜水井”；有介绍少数民族地区的儿童对敌斗争的生活的，如“荞子和格丽黄”、“小米霞”等；也有写美国和平战士罗森堡夫妇的孩子不幸的遭遇，引起我国儿童深切的同情和关怀，而具有高度的国际主义意义的，如“寄到汤姆斯河去的诗”；也有以中国儿童所熟悉的民间故事改写为剧本的，如“大灰狼”和“果树姐妹”。这几年来所发表的一些优秀作品，尽管还存在着某些缺点，但是它们确实能以新的思想感情向儿童进行品德教育，引导我们的新生的一代走向更广阔的世界。
    我们的工作有成绩，但也有很多缺点，这些缺点需要我们尽最大的努力去克服。从儿童文学创作发展的道路来看，我们所做的，仅仅是一个新的开端，我们的工作，不论从作品的数量和质量来说，离开儿童的要求都还很远。
    在儿童文学创作中的一个基本问题，我认为，还是作者对目前儿童生活的了解是否深入的问题。
    有一些儿童文学作家在这方面为我们创造了范例。他们确实经常主动地接触儿童，关心他们，热爱他们，因此他们就能生动具体地反映出儿童的现实生活，并以此去教育广大的儿童。这些作品也为儿童所喜爱。如郭墟的“杨司令的少先队”，是一部描写儿童参加革命斗争的不可多得的作品。作者写东北抗日联军中的一个少先队组织，那些小英雄都有鲜明的个性；他们和成人一样地参加战斗，但是过的却是儿童自己的生活，说话、行动也都表达出儿童自己的思想感情。作者成功地刻划出黑姑这个勇敢、活泼、可爱的朝鲜女孩子，给读者以极深刻的感染力量。作者如果对这些孩子的生活不熟悉，那是写不出这样的好作品来的。张天翼的“他们和我们”里的几个孩子，也给人一种真诚、活泼、可爱的鲜明形象，作者写到儿童的一些缺点，并不像一般所写的那样成人气，而是合情合理地展开冲突，又得到解决，一切都是合乎儿童的思想感情的。我们写儿童的缺点，必须采取这样的态度，我认为这是作者最能反映出生动活泼的儿童生活的一篇小说。
    可是，我们也有占相当数量的作品，还没有跳出概念化、公式化的圈子。这有以下几种原因：一种是作者对儿童的生活缺乏了解，或者了解不够深刻，看不出儿童身上正在迅速成长的新的品质，动笔要写的时候，在自己的脑子里就找不到一个具有优秀品质的活生生的儿童的形象；第二种原因是作者对儿童教育缺乏研究，还不十分明确应该以什么去教育儿童，而是主观地用一些道德概念去凑合；第三种原因是作者的文学修养较差，不能把自己心里所体会的恰如其分地表达出来。这三种原因都是互相关联着的，对我们来说，三者需要同时努力提高，忽视那一种都不行。有一个辅导员反映儿童对概念化、公式化作品的批评，孩子们说：“这样的书，看了头准知道尾。”还说：“这种故事我都会编。”来自儿童方面的这些意见是很尖锐的，但也是很真挚很热情的。
    我们不够熟悉儿童的生活，不够了解儿童的真实的思想感情，这样也就很自然的只会向儿童进行正面说教，却不会通过艺术的形象来写儿童的真实生活。可是儿童文学作品所要达到的目的，不是为了教训儿童，主要是为了很自然很亲切地引导儿童注意什么是好的，什么是坏的，使儿童不是被迫地去接受那些枯燥乏味的“教训”，而是勇往直前地去追求他们的精神领域里所需要的新的和好的东西。
    由于我们没有深入儿童生活，我们也就不能很熟练切实地掌握儿童心理的特点。在我们极大部分的作品中，还没有充分表现出祖国新生一代的勇敢活泼、生气蓬勃的精神。我们不能大胆地写出儿童好动的、好奇的、明朗的、乐观的、充满英雄气概的性格，往往把顽皮的儿童写成横行霸道、流气十足的“反面人物”，把学习好、品行好的儿童写成规规矩矩、满口政治名词的“小干部”。这样写法是违反儿童的现实生活的，不管是顽皮的或者比较优秀的儿童，他们的真实的思想感情决不会是这样的，他们在爱玩和好奇方面，有他们的共同之处，因为儿童正在成长发育时期，这是他们身心发展的要求。所不同的，有的儿童能自觉的要求进步，有的却过于贪玩，对学习不够重视。我们要写顽皮的或者优秀的儿童，都应该给读者一个活泼可爱的印象，不应该使人觉得那些顽皮的儿童是讨厌的，那些优秀的儿童是很“听话”的。到现在为止，我们在作品里还没有刻划出足以代表这个时代的儿童的生龙活虎的性格，我们也没有塑造出一些在现实生活中已经存在着的最令人可爱的儿童的典型。我想，只要我们能踏踏实实地做去，真正全心全意的为培养和教育儿童而服务，我们在这方面一定会有更好的成就的。
    儿童文学作家要和个别儿童交朋友，也要到儿童的集体生活中去了解他们，这样才能真正了解他们的思想感情，体会他们新的道德品质的成长。因为，儿童在学校和家里受到新的影响，也受到旧的影响。作家本身的童年生活，全是从旧社会里过来的，要了解现在儿童的生活就有一个很大的距离。因此对我们来说，更需要深入了解儿童生活，要在新和旧的斗争之间去了解儿童的思想感情。更重要的是，儿童文学作家本身必须具有新的道德品质；如果我们自己不先具备社会主义的思想感情，我们又怎么能用社会主义的思想感情去教育下一代呢？别林斯基要求儿童文学作家具有一定的智力和道德品质，这些品质就是：生动显著的想像，认识儿童，热爱儿童，以及像儿童样的天真的性格。他说：“有一种人是这样的，他们很爱儿童的世界，能给儿童讲故事，说长说短，甚至能和儿童一起玩耍；他很用心地倾听他们的说话，用真诚的信任把他们当做朋友看待。”这一段话，对于我们了解儿童生活是很重要的，这样的要求也不算过分。我们要做好这个工作，除了深入了解儿童生活以外，必须加强理论学习，努力提高艺术水平，我们在文学方面所要学习的，和一般作家并没有什么差别，而且我们更需要研究儿童心理和教育，我们平时跑到生活里去发现不出问题，也就是我们这些基本条件具备得不够。
    儿童文学作家生活圈子的狭小，也影响了题材的广泛性，我们除了写儿童学习生活以外，同时也需要写课堂以外的儿童生活，写儿童与儿童之间的友谊，写儿童在家里的生活，写儿童和周围成人们所处的关系，我们很可以把这个圈子扩展开来，从多方面向儿童进行社会主义的品德教育。我想，我们吸取题材的范围是很广的，哪里有儿童，哪里就有我们的创作题材，我们需要写农村儿童的生活，我们也需要写革命领袖和英雄的童年生活，我们要通过故事或游记等形式，向儿童介绍祖国的自然景物和各种知识。
    目前我们儿童文学创作的形式也还不够多样，最感缺乏的是戏剧和童话。事实上儿童最喜欢这一类形式的作品。我们能演给儿童看的剧本，实在少得可怜，儿童自己开队会或晚会，要想演个短剧却找不到剧本，几个儿童剧团每年苦于订不出上演戏剧的计划，这个形式需要我们好好利用它；童话是儿童文学中所特有的形式，作家运用这个形式的也很少，可是儿童对童话竟是那样的爱好，我参加过儿童自己主持的几个故事会，其中讲童话的最多，也最受欢迎，而讲的多半是翻译过来的外国童话。我们的民间故事经过改写介绍给儿童看的，也并不多。对于这种能启发儿童想像，能培养儿童纯朴和优美的感情的童话和民间故事，不能看作是“冷门”的东西，好的童话和民间故事，和那些以现实生活为题材的作品一样，也可以向儿童进行道德与品质的教育。
    这几年来，儿童的进步是非常快的，在他们的身上新的东西天天在增加。我们的儿童文学创作虽然有了一些发展，但从儿童的要求来看，还是落在儿童的现实生活的后面。让我们加倍地努力，争取儿童文学创作更大的发展，为培养社会主义新人这一光荣的、艰巨的任务贡献出最大的力量！
