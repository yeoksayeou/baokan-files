    Parents Should Use Correct Methods to Educate Their Children
    Bai Juru
    Children are the future hope of the country. Once they grow up, they will be the builders of society and the successors to the revolutionary cause. How to cultivate them into people who are physically and mentally sound, lively, brave, honest, love labor, love learning, love the motherland, and are full of collectivist spirit is a matter that every parent must care about. We have many wise parents who know their responsibilities to their children and understand the correct methods of educating them; but some parents either treat their children with scolding and punishment, or spoil and pamper them too much, and neither is right.
    Since liberation, the phenomenon of abuse and maltreatment of children in society has been basically eliminated. However, due to thousands of years of habit and the failure to completely eliminate old ideas, the phenomenon of using scolding and punishment to discipline children still exists widely among the broad masses of the people in our country. Simply using scolding and punishment to educate children can only achieve temporary results and cannot fundamentally solve the problem, and often produces bad consequences. Children are innocent and their thinking is exceptionally simple. When they are suddenly scolded and punished, the strong stimulation to their body and mind prevents them from calmly thinking about what mistakes they have made. What they feel first is humiliation, and over time, it will foster a sense of antagonism and even hatred. This greatly damages the children's respect for their parents and creates great difficulties for future education of the children. Some children even learn from their parents to treat their siblings, neighbors, and classmates in this way. When they grow up a little, they will quarrel and fight with their parents, becoming rude and undisciplined people. Some children are frightened by their quick-tempered parents, and the fear of making mistakes weighs heavily on their hearts. As a result, they gradually become timid, blindly obedient, and weak-willed people, and even become skilled liars. At the same time, scolding and punishment are very harmful to children's physical health. Once a parent adopts the method of beating and scolding children, it is easy to often beat and scold them, and may even develop to the point where problems cannot be solved without beating and scolding. This will make the relationship between families, parents, and children very bad.
    There are also some parents who spoil and pamper their children too much, surrounding them with delicious food and toys all day long, and praising them with the nicest words. They don't let them go out to feel the wind and sun, for fear that they will catch a cold and get sick; they don't let them run and jump, for fear that they will fall and get hurt. They often spend more than they can afford to buy beautiful clothes to dress them up; they ask the children what freshest things they want to eat, what strangest wishes they have, and do everything possible to satisfy them. The whole family is busy around the child, doing everything they can do for the child. The parents think that this is the way to love their children, and that only children who grow up under such "meticulous" care will become good children. In fact, this is a huge mistake. This will encourage children to only seek personal enjoyment and encourage them to find ways to rely on the labor of others to live; this will foster children's lazy habits, make them unable to be independent, and cultivate their contempt for labor and selfish desires. Children who grow up like this often have superior and arrogant emotions and cannot unite and cooperate well with other children. At the same time, because they have little physical activity and do not often come into contact with nature, their bodies will not be healthy and their brains will be sluggish. Such children are likely to become mediocre and useless people.
    Choosing and creating the right methods to educate children is an unshirkable responsibility for every father and mother.
    If we want our children to grow up to be useful people, the most important thing is to pay attention to patiently teaching and cultivating them when they are young. If we see that children cannot do things or do them well, we should neither ridicule them nor discourage them, but should help and enlighten them and give them more opportunities to practice. Do not do things for children that they can do themselves, and give the children as many things as possible that they can do themselves. Be patient with children. This is an indispensable virtue for a good mother and father. When a child does something wrong, examine the cause of the error with a calm attitude, and explain to him or her calmly where the mistake is and what to do next time. It should be understood that there are very few children who deliberately do things badly. It is necessary to point out the mistakes that children have made, but attention should be paid to the manner and method and to choosing the appropriate occasion, and criticism of children should be avoided at any time and in any place. It is absolutely forbidden for anyone in the family to nag and complain all day long. Do not rashly promise children's requests, and once you have promised, you must keep your promise. It is even more impermissible to make the child cry and then laugh to satisfy one's own abnormal psychology. Children should not be praised for no reason, nor should they be blamed for no reason. In short, children should feel that their parents are amiable, trustworthy, and a model for their behavior.
    In the family, children should be encouraged to engage in labor activities in various ways. Children should be taught to gradually take care of themselves, such as eating, dressing, washing their faces, making their beds, washing handkerchiefs, and tidying up their toys. Children are very willing to help adults with some housework, and parents should not only not refuse them, but also encourage them to do so and patiently teach them how to do it. Children should be allowed to engage in creative games. Children love to plant flowers and plants, water them, trim the branches, and feed small animals; they are willing to engage in building, painting, sculpting, and paper-cutting. Children should be taught to get used to using tools such as knives, scissors, hammers, and saws, and to recognize the names of some appliances in the home. Children find great joy in being independent. When children are willing to buy some simple items from nearby shops, when children are willing to find their way home by themselves, they should be encouraged and their self-esteem should not be hurt. From an early age, children should be made to live in an orderly manner, with regular eating and sleeping times. Children's stationery, toys, and other utensils should be kept clean, so as to train them in an orderly habit and cultivate their organized and disciplined character. If they have started to do something, they should be encouraged to persevere to the end and cultivate their strong willpower. Children should be polite at all times and in all places, respect the elders, and sympathize with and be willing to help the weak. Make them understand love and hate, right and wrong. Children should be taught to cherish life, not to trample on flowers and plants, and not to cruelly harm small animals. Children should also be made to understand who the enemies of mankind are.
    When educating children, the most important thing is for parents to set an example and guide children with their own behavior. If adults are lazy, it is difficult to teach children to love labor. If the family is harmonious and the parents respect and love each other, the children will learn politeness and caring for others from their parents and will have a love of peace and positive and optimistic qualities.
    "There are no children who cannot be educated, only bad educational methods," this is a great truth.
    If parents realize that there are errors in their methods of educating their children, they should quickly correct them. They can find their beloved children and talk to them, listening to what they are thinking in their little minds. Let them make suggestions, they will definitely have suggestions. Wise parents can admit their mistakes to their children. Let the children re-recognize their parents and establish new feelings with them. Fathers and mothers should check every year on "June 1st" International Children's Day whether their methods of educating children and their attitudes towards children are correct, so that the new generation can receive a good education in the family.
    Let us take on the glorious responsibility of educating children together for the true happiness of children.

    父母应该用正确的方法教育子女
    白菊如
    少年儿童是国家未来的希望，他们一旦长大成人，就是社会的建设者和革命事业的继承人。如何把他们培养成为体魄健全的，活泼、勇敢、诚实、爱劳动、爱学习、爱祖国和富有集体主义精神的人，乃是每一个做父母的人所必须关心的事情。我们有许多贤明的父母，他们深知对子女的责任，也懂得教导子女的正确方法；但也有些做父母的，或者用责骂惩罚的办法来对待子女；或者对子女过于娇养溺爱，这都是不对的。
    解放以来，社会上摧残和虐待儿童的现象是基本消灭了。但是由于千百年来的习惯，由于旧思想没有彻底清除，在我国广大人民中，用责骂惩罚的方法来管教儿童的现象还普遍存在着。单纯地用责骂惩罚的方法来教育儿童，只能收到暂时的效果，不能根本解决问题，并且往往产生不良的后果。孩子是天真的，思想异常单纯，当他突然受到责骂惩罚的时候，身体和精神的强烈刺激，使他不能冷静地想到自己究竟犯了什么错误。他首先感到的是屈辱，时间久了，并且会滋长一种对抗情绪，甚至憎恨心理。这就大大损害了儿童对父母的崇敬心，给今后对子女的教育造成很大的困难。有些儿童甚至也向父母学会了用这种方法来对待自己的兄弟姊妹，对待自己的邻居和同学。当他们稍微长大了一点的时候，就会和父母对吵对打，变成性情粗暴和不遵守纪律的人。也有一些小孩子在暴躁的父母亲面前被吓呆了，怕犯错误的恐惧，沉重地压在他们心上，于是他们逐渐变成了怯懦、盲目服从、意志薄弱的人，甚至变成撒谎的能手。同时，责骂惩罚的办法对儿童的身体健康也有很大的害处。一个家长一旦对儿童采用了打骂的办法，很容易常常打骂，甚至会发展到不打骂不能解决问题的地步。这就会使家庭之间、父母和子女之间的关系弄得十分恶劣。
    也有一些父母，对自己的子女过于娇养溺爱，整天用好吃的东西和玩具包围着他们，用最好听的话歌颂着他们。不让他们出去吹风和晒太阳，唯恐他们感冒生病；不让他们跑跑跳跳，唯恐他们跌伤碰破。常常用自己力所不及的花费，购买漂亮的衣着来打扮他们；追问着孩子想吃些什么最新鲜的东西，有什么最奇怪的愿望，并尽一切力量来满足他们。全家的人围绕在孩子身边忙乱着，代替孩子做他们能做的一切事情。做父母的以为这样才是疼爱自己的孩子，只有在这样“无微不至”的爱护下生长起来的孩子才会成为好孩子。其实这是极大的错误。这样就会鼓励孩子只图个人享福，鼓励他们想办法依靠别人的劳动过活；这就养成了孩子的懒惰习惯，使他们不能自立，并培养了他们轻视劳动和自私自利的个人欲望。这样长大的孩子，往往有着超群和骄傲的情绪，不能和别的孩子很好地团结合作。同时，由于他们体力活动少，不常接触自然界，身体就不会健康，脑力就会迟钝。这样的孩子，很容易变成庸俗无用的人。
    选择和创造正确的方法来教育子女，是每一位父亲和母亲不可推卸的责任。
    我们要想孩子长大了成为一个有用的人，最要紧的，是在他们幼小的时候就注意耐心地教导和培养他们。如果看到孩子不会做或做不好事情，我们既不要讥笑他们，也不要打击他们，应该帮助和启发他们，给他们更多的练习的机会。不要代替孩子做他们能做的事，要把孩子们能做的事，尽可能地交给孩子自己做。对待孩子要有耐性。这是好妈妈、好爸爸所不可缺少的品德。当孩子做错了事的时候，要以冷静的态度来考察造成错误的原因，心平气和地对他讲清过错在那里，下次应当怎样做。应该了解，存心把事情做坏的孩子是很少的。指出孩子所犯的错误，是必须的；但是要注意方式方法和选择适当的场合，应该避免随时随地去批评孩子。家庭中切不可有人终日唠唠叨叨，絮絮不休地说埋怨话。不能轻率地允诺孩子的要求，既允诺了，就必须实践自己的诺言。更不允许一会把孩子逗哭，一会把孩子逗笑，来满足自己一种不正常的心理。不应当无故夸奖孩子，也不应当无故责备他们。总之，要使儿童感到自己的父母是和蔼可亲和可以信赖的，是他们行为的榜样。
    在家庭里要通过各种方式，鼓励儿童从事劳动活动。要教会孩子慢慢地自己照顾自己，如吃饭，穿衣，洗脸，整理床铺，洗手帕，整理玩具。孩子非常愿意帮助大人从事一些家务劳动，父母不仅不应该拒绝他们，而且要鼓励他们这样做，耐心地教给他们怎样做。要使儿童从事创造性的游戏，孩子非常喜欢种植花草、浇水、整理花枝、喂养小动物；愿意从事建筑、绘画、塑造和剪纸。应该教给儿童习惯于使用刀子、剪子、锤子、锯子等工具，教给儿童认识家庭中一些器具的名称。儿童以自立为极大的喜悦，当儿童愿意到邻近的店铺买回一点简单的物品，当儿童自己愿意找寻回家的路的时候，要鼓励他们，不要损伤他们的自尊心。从小的时候起，就要使儿童生活有秩序，吃睡定时。儿童的文具、玩具和其它的用具要保持整洁，这样来训练他们井然有序的习惯，培养他们有条理和守秩序的性格。每一件事，如果他们已经开始做了，就要鼓励他们坚持到底，培养他们坚强的毅力。要随时随地使儿童有礼貌，尊敬长者，同情和勇于帮助弱者。使他们懂得爱和憎，是和非。要使儿童爱护生命，不践踏花草，不残暴地伤害小动物。也要让儿童懂得什么是人类的敌人。
    在对儿童进行教育的时候，最主要的是做父母的要以身作则，用自己的行为来引导儿童。如果大人是懒懒散散的，很难教会儿童喜爱劳动。如果家庭是和睦的，父母之间是互敬互爱的，孩子就会从双亲那里学会礼貌和关心别人，就会具有热爱和平和积极、乐观的品质。
    “没有不能教育的儿女，只有不良的教育方法”，这是至理。
    如果父母意识到自己教育儿女的方法有错误，那就要赶快改正。可以把自己亲爱的儿女找到身边来和他们谈谈心，听听他们小心眼儿里想的事情。让他们提提意见，他们一定会有意见的。贤明的父母是可以向儿女承认错误的。让孩子重新认识自己的父母，和父母建立新的感情。父亲和母亲应该在每年的“六一”国际儿童节日，检查一下自己教育儿童的方法和对待儿童的态度是否正确，使新一代能够在家庭里受到良好的教育。
    让我们为了儿童的真正幸福，共同担负起教育儿童的光荣责任吧。
