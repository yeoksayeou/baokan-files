    Strengthening the Management of Rural Grain Markets
    Since many rural areas and market towns established grain markets led by the state without the participation of private merchants, the exchange of goods among farmers has expanded, and the rural economy has become more active. Market order is good, grain prices are stable, and the peasant masses are extremely satisfied.
    However, in some areas, due to neglecting the organization and management of the markets, speculative grain merchants have infiltrated market activities, driving up grain prices, creating black markets, and snapping up grain. A recent inspection of 410 markets in Hebei Province revealed that the listed prices and market prices were to varying degrees out of sync in 120 markets. In some places, this also led wealthy farmers to take the opportunity to snap up grain, and those with surplus grain in rural areas hoarded it, reluctant to sell, which hindered the exchange of goods among farmers and disrupted normal rural life. This phenomenon must be quickly corrected.
    The situation in the primary rural grain markets, on the one hand, shows that many rural work cadres do not sufficiently value the establishment of state-led grain markets and have relaxed their leadership and management of these markets. The broad masses of peasants also lack a deep understanding of the close relationship between these markets and their own vital interests. Some of them still harbor various concerns and have not actively participated in transactions; others have not observed proper market order. Therefore, local Party committees must conduct in-depth inspections, educate rural cadres, and continue to carry out in-depth publicity of the grain planned supply policy in rural areas, publicizing the state's policy of allowing farmers to sell surplus grain and adjust surpluses and deficiencies. The purpose, nature, methods, and benefits of the new type of grain market established by the state must be fully explained to the farmers, and the peasant masses must be mobilized to actively supervise and report illegal activities of grain merchants and peddlers.
    On the other hand, the situation in the primary rural grain markets also reflects the struggle of grain merchants to undermine state plans and oppose state restrictions. We must not relax our vigilance against the destructive activities of these bourgeois elements for a moment and must quickly strengthen the management of grain markets. To prevent grain merchants from mixing into the market, it is necessary to stipulate some necessary procedures for farmers participating in transactions. The boundary between strict and lenient procedures is that leniency should not go so far as to abandon restrictions on merchants, and strictness should not go so far as to dampen farmers' interest in transactions. Generally speaking, when grain markets are first established, it is beneficial and harmless to relax and simplify aspects such as transaction limits, issuing certificates, and price fluctuations. When stricter procedures are needed in different situations, they should naturally be stricter. Moreover, in strict market management, those speculative grain merchants who transport large quantities of grain, drive up prices, and repeatedly fail to correct their behavior despite education should be severely cracked down on, and those with serious circumstances should also be given legal sanctions. Urban noodle and flour product businesses and reproduction industries must also be strictly controlled, and those already supplied by the state according to plan are not allowed to purchase grain from the market with certificates.
    As long as the above measures are taken, the state grain markets that have already been established will become more active, and the demand for exchange of goods among farmers will be further satisfied.

### 加强农村粮食市场的管理

    加强农村粮食市场的管理
    许多农村和集镇建立了由国家领导而没有私商参加的粮食市场以后，农民互通有无的交易扩展了，农村经济活跃了。市场秩序良好，粮食价格稳定，农民群众极表满意。
    但是，也有一些地区，由于忽视了市场的组织与管理工作，投机粮商又渗入了市场活动，他们哄抬粮价，制造黑市，抢购粮食。河北省最近检查了四百一十个市场，有一百二十个市场的牌价和市价都有程度不同的脱节现象。在某些地方，并引起富裕农民也趁机抢购粮食，农村有余粮者囤粮惜售，这就妨害了农民互通有无，破坏了农村的正常生活。这种现象必须迅速纠正。
    农村初级粮食市场的这种情况，一方面说明很多农村工作干部对建立国家领导的粮食市场，还不够重视，放松了对这种市场的领导和管理。而广大农民也没有深刻理解这种市场和自己切身利益的密切关系，他们有的人还存在着各种顾虑，没有积极参加交易；有的人又没有遵守正当的市场秩序。因此，各地党委必须深入检查，教育农村干部，并在农村中继续深入宣传粮食计划供应政策，宣传国家允许农民出卖余粮和调剂有无的政策，把国家建立的新型的粮食市场的目的、性质、办法和好处，充分向农民说清楚，发动农民群众积极监督和检举粮商粮贩的违法活动。
    另一方面，农村初级粮食市场的这些情况，也反映了粮食商人破坏国家计划，反对国家限制的斗争，对这些资产阶级分子的破坏活动，我们一刻也不能放松警惕，必须迅速加强粮食市场的管理工作。为了防止粮商混入市场，对于农民参加交易就不能不规定一些必要的手续。这些手续的宽严界线，是宽不能宽到放弃对商人的限制，严不可严到打击农民的交易兴趣。一般地讲，在粮食市场初办时，在交易限额、开具证明、价格升降等方面，放宽和简便一点，是有利而无害的。在与此不同的情况下需要严密手续时，就自然应该严密一点。而且，在严密市场管理中，对于大量贩运粮食，哄抬粮价、屡教不改的投机粮商，应给予严厉的打击，对情节严重的，还应予以法律处分。对于城市面食业、复制业也要严格控制，已由国家按照计划供应的不准再凭证向市场购买粮食。
    只要采取了以上措施，目前已建立起来的国家粮食市场，才会更加活跃，农民中间互通有无的要求才会进一步得到满足。
