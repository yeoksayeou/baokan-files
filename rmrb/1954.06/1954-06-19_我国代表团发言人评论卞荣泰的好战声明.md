Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 17th: Huang Hua, spokesman of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China to the Geneva Conference, made the following comment on the statement made by Byun Yung-tai, representative of South Korea, at a press conference on June 16th:

    The day after the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue was unilaterally broken off, Byun Yung-tai, the Foreign Minister of South Korea, made the most blatant belligerent statement at a press conference. This statement fully exposes the dire consequences of the action of the representatives of the sixteen nations participating in the Korean War, who followed the United States in unilaterally breaking off the conference. In this statement, which was obviously encouraged by the United States, Byun Yung-tai openly declared that, due to the failure of the Korean negotiations, the Korean Armistice Agreement is invalid, and the Syngman Rhee government is completely unbound by any constraints of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    Byun Yung-tai's statement is not unexpected. As early as before the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue began, and while the discussion was underway, from Dulles' and Syngman Rhee's repeated predictions that the Geneva Conference would certainly end in failure, it was already possible to see an evil attempt to force the negotiations to fail in order to create a tense situation. Now, Byun Yung-tai's statement is merely a further public exposure of this attempt.

    It should be pointed out that Byun Yung-tai's statement will help people to recognize the position of the representatives of the sixteen nations who broke off the Korean negotiations on June 15th. Fully aware of the dangerous plans of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, after their proposals for the peaceful unification of Korea were unreasonably rejected and no agreement could be reached, put forward important proposals for consolidating peace in Korea at the June 15th meeting with the utmost sincerity. These proposals were again rudely rejected by the sixteen nations. All the claims made by the representatives of the sixteen nations, headed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Smith, in their joint declaration and individual statements, that they rejected these proposals because there was already a Korean Armistice Agreement, and that they equally desired peace, have been proven to be utter lies within twenty-four hours.

    The sixteen nations, which caused the breakdown of the conference by rejecting the proposals of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union, should bear responsibility for the possible consequences of any adventures that the Syngman Rhee clique may take.

    我国代表团发言人评论卞荣泰的好战声明
    【新华社日内瓦十七日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华十七日就南朝鲜代表卞荣泰十六日在记者招待会上的声明发表评论如下：
    在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题讨论被片面破裂以后的第二天，南朝鲜的外务部长官卞荣泰就在记者招待会上发表了最露骨的好战声明。这个声明充分暴露了参加侵朝战争的十六国代表追随美国片面破裂会议的行动已经造成了何等恶劣的后果。卞荣泰在这个显然受到美国鼓励的声明中公然宣称：由于朝鲜谈判的失败，朝鲜停战协定已经无效，李承晚政府已经完全不受朝鲜停战协定的任何约束。
    卞荣泰的发言并不出乎意料之外。早在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论开始以前，以及讨论正在进行的时候，从杜勒斯和李承晚一再预断日内瓦会议定将归于失败的声明中，已经可以看出有一种迫使谈判失败以制造紧张局势的邪恶企图。现在卞荣泰的发言不过是进一步公开了这种企图而已。
    应该指出，卞荣泰的发言将有助于使人们认清在六月十五日破裂了朝鲜谈判的十六国代表的立场。充分估计到了美国与李承晚集团的危险打算，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联三国代表团在和平统一朝鲜的建议被无理拒绝而无法达成协议以后，又以最大的诚意在六月十五日会议上提出了巩固朝鲜和平的重要建议。这些建议仍然遭到了十六国的粗鲁拒绝。以美国副国务卿史密斯为首的十六国代表在他们的共同宣言与个别发言中，硬说他们拒绝这些建议是因为已有了朝鲜停战协定，硬说他们一样愿望和平，所有这些说法，已经在二十四小时以内被证明是彻头彻尾的谎言。
    对于李承晚集团可能采取的一切冒险，因为拒绝朝、中、苏建议而使会议陷于破裂的十六国应对其可能的后果负担责任。
