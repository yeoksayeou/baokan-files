    Henan Province Reviews Advance Purchase Contracts
    By the end of May, Henan Province had exceeded its planned targets for advance purchase of agricultural products such as cotton, peanuts, and wheat. In light of the rather chaotic advance purchase procedures in some areas, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has requested that all localities, in coordination with the summer harvest and planting, conduct checks and reviews of advance purchase contracts in order to promptly eliminate errors and ensure the smooth fulfillment of the contracts. In early June, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Henan Provincial People's Government dispatched working groups composed of cadres to Anyang, Shangqiu, and Xinyang prefectures to assist in carrying out the inspection work. Currently, supply and marketing cooperatives and other organizations in Xuchang, Nanyang, Puyang, and other areas have already begun or are about to begin reviewing advance purchase contracts.

    河南省复核预购合同
    河南省预购棉花、花生、小麦等农产品的计划，到五月底已经超额完成。根据有些地区预购手续相当混乱的情况，中共河南省委要求各地配合夏收夏种工作，对预购合同进行检查复核，以便及时消灭差错，保证预购合同顺利实现。六月上旬，河南省人民政府财政经济委员会已抽调干部组织工作组，分赴安阳、商邱、信阳三专区协助开展检查工作。目前，许昌、南阳、濮阳等地的供销合作社等，都已经开始或即将开始复核预购合同。
