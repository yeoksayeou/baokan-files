Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to a report in the New York "Worker's Daily" on June 14th, the U.S. Communist Party's representative meetings in eleven regions, recently held in New York City, issued a manifesto calling on all Communist Party members and all other peace-loving Americans to "launch a massive crusade for peace." The regions sending representatives to the meeting were New England, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Missouri.

The manifesto stated: Millions are speaking out in the strongest terms against the prospect of a hydrogen bomb war. They demand a ceasefire in Indochina and oppose Eisenhower and Dulles' threats to intensify and expand the war in Indochina... Our people have unmistakably expressed their opinion. Letters are flooding President Eisenhower, Senators, Representatives, and newspapers, demanding a ban on the hydrogen bomb and protesting the vicious plan to send American soldiers to die in the jungles of Indochina. Labor leaders, religious groups, and many other organizations have spoken out against our government's war policies.

The manifesto pointed out: The Eisenhower administration has not only lost the trust of the people of other countries, but also the trust of many Americans who elected it to office in 1952. The Korean War provided painful lessons. The American people learned through hardship that the movement for national independence is extremely broad and powerful, and that the Wall Street-Washington leadership's policies of force and violence cannot reverse or extinguish it. This is true not only in Asia, but also in Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere.

All of Asia is demanding that the People's Republic of China obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations. All of Asia is speaking out against the hydrogen bomb and against Washington's policy of using intervention to suppress national liberation movements. The vast majority of humanity is demanding an end to the war in Indochina and the elimination of hydrogen bomb warfare from the world through some form of negotiation. In Western Europe and Latin America, the demand for East-West trade is growing. The same is true in our own country, where, under the influence of the approaching economic crisis, many people are re-examining the issue of East-West trade.

These are the realities that Eisenhower and Dulles' policies refuse to recognize. But America's needs urgently demand change. The leadership of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of the AFL, the conference of 212 Methodist churches in New England, the American Friends Service Committee, and other religious groups have all expressed opposition to sending American troops to Indochina. America needs trade with the vast socialist market. America needs a genuine American foreign policy based on ending the war in Indochina and the Cold War, accepting the principle of peaceful coexistence, and promoting friendship and trade.

The manifesto continued: The labor movement bears a major responsibility for breaking away from the foreign policy of big business; a foreign policy that is good for labor is a foreign policy that is good for America.

Labor's initiative in the 1954 elections can promote the unity of workers, farmers, Black people, small business people, professionals, and all other peace-loving Americans to defeat the mad war-mongers and the pro-fascist McCarthyites and Southern Democrats.

The manifesto stated: We, the Communist Party representatives from various states meeting in New York City, issue an urgent appeal to all Communist Party members and all other Americans who want to save our country from the horrors of hydrogen bomb war, calling for the launch of a massive crusade for peace.

Write to Eisenhower and organize delegations to meet with your Representatives and Senators, telling them that the American people want an end to the war in Indochina and five-power negotiations to declare atomic and hydrogen bombs illegal. Let them know that the people oppose all acts of aggression against Guatemala. Get your unions and other organizations to act. Support and strengthen all existing peace organizations, launch a powerful mass movement to prevent real acts of betrayal of America, curb the war plotters, and turn our country into a bastion of peace and freedom. Let the voice of the people be heard – for peace!

    美共举行十一个地区的党代表会议并发表文告
    号召展开反对战争和争取和平的运动
    【新华社柏林讯】据纽约“工人日报”六月十四日的消息说，最近在纽约市举行的美国共产党十一个地区的党代表会议发表了一篇文告，号召全体共产党党员和所有其他爱好和平的美国人“发动大规模的和平十字军运动”。派代表参加这次会议的地区有新英格兰、康涅狄格、纽约、新泽西、东宾夕法尼亚、西宾夕法尼亚、马里兰、俄亥俄、密执安、伊利诺斯和密苏里。
    文告说：千百万人都以最坚决的方式大声疾呼反对氢弹战争的前景。他们要求实行印度支那停战，并反对艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的加紧和扩大印度支那战争的威胁……我国人民已无可误解地表明了他们的意见。信件像雪片一样飞往艾森豪威尔总统、参议院议员、众议院议员和报纸那里，要求禁止氢弹，并抗议把美国大兵派到印度支那丛林里去送死的恶毒计划。劳工领袖、宗教团体和许多其他组织，都大声疾呼地反对我国政府的战争政策。
    文告指出：艾森豪威尔政府不但丧失了其他国家人民的信任，而且也丧失了在一九五二年选举它执政的许多美国人的信任。朝鲜战争给了痛苦的教训。美国人民在艰苦中学习到：争取民族独立的运动极为广泛和强大有力、华尔街——华盛顿领导集团的武力和强暴政策是不能把它扭转和扑灭的。这不仅在亚洲是这样，而且在拉丁美洲、非洲和其他各地都是这样。
    整个亚洲都要求使中华人民共和国在联合国里取得合法的席位。整个亚洲都大声疾呼地反对氢弹，反对华盛顿的用干涉来镇压民族解放运动的政策。绝大多数人类都要求结束印度支那战争，并用某种谈判方式使氢弹战争在世界上绝迹。在西欧和拉丁美洲，发展东西方贸易的要求日益高涨。在我们自己的国家里也是一样，在日益接近的经济危机的影响下，许多人士已在重新研究东西方贸易问题。
    这些是艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的政策拒绝承认的实际情况。但是，美国的需要迫切要求作出改变。劳联的混合切肉工人工会的领导方面，新英格兰二百一十二个卫理公会教堂的会议，美国教友服务委员会以及其他宗教团体都表示反对派遣美军去印度支那。美国需要与广大的社会主义市场贸易。美国需要以结束印度支那战争和冷战、以接受和平共处的原则、以促进友谊与贸易为基础的真正的美国外交政策。
    文告接着说：劳工运动对摆脱大企业外交政策负有主要责任，对劳工有利的外交政策就是对美国有利的外交政策。
    劳工在一九五四年选举中的主动性，可以促进工人、农民、黑人、小商人、自由职业者以及所有其他爱好和平的美国人的团结，以击败疯狂的战争贩子和拥护法西斯主义的麦卡锡分子和美国南部的民主党人。
    文告说：我们各州的共产党代表在纽约市举行会议，我们向所有的共产党员以及所有其他想把我们的国家从氢弹战争的恐怖中拯救出来的美国人发出紧急呼吁，号召发起大规模的和平十字军运动。
    写信给艾森豪威尔并组织代表团去会见你们的众议员和参议员，告诉他们美国人民希望结束印度支那战争，并举行五大国谈判宣布原子弹与氢弹为非法。让他们知道人民反对所有对危地马拉的侵略行动。叫你们的工会和其他组织行动起来。支持并加强所有现有的和平组织，发动强有力的群众运动，以防止真正的出卖美国的行为，遏止战争阴谋者，把我们的国家变成和平与自由的堡垒。让人民的声音被大家听见——争取和平。
