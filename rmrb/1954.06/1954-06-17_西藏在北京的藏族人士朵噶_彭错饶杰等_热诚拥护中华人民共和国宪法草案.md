Tibetan figures in Beijing, Dorga Pengcuo Raojie, Ngawang Jinba, Gazhang Luosang Renzeng, as well as Ranba Nangji Wangdui, Director of the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, and Luowang, Acting Director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing, enthusiastically endorsed the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and shared their thoughts with reporters.

    Dorga Pengcuo Raojie, head of the 1953 Tibetan National Day observation delegation, said in an interview: I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the great "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China." The spirit of people's democracy, equality, unity, friendship, and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups of the motherland runs through the draft constitution from beginning to end; it will become the source of a happy life for all ethnic groups. The draft constitution also stipulates that all ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and scripts, and the freedom to maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs. The draft constitution will be enthusiastically endorsed by the clergy and laity in Tibet.

    He said: This great draft constitution was produced under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. It can only be achieved in an era of equality and happiness for all ethnic groups in the motherland. It makes us feel the loveliness of our motherland's big family more deeply. In the past, reactionary rulers also formulated "constitutions," but they aggravated discrimination and insults against our minority ethnic groups. Today, our draft constitution not only fully conforms to the interests of all ethnic groups in its content, but also the drafting process is fully democratic. I myself participated in the discussion of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (First Draft)." I also feel honored because of this!

    Ngawang Jinba, deputy head of the observation delegation, said in an interview: The "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" embodies the great motherland's deep concern for all minority ethnic groups, and shows that the brilliance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao shines on all ethnic groups in the motherland. During the period of reactionary rule, we Tibetans were like blind people when it came to politics. After liberation, we have begun to embark on the bright road, and in the future, in the big family of the motherland, we will have an even happier life.

    Gazhang Luosang Renzeng, deputy head of the observation delegation, said in an interview: The "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" is the foundation of the common interests of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and it will become a treasure to protect the interests of all ethnic groups. Many clauses in the draft constitution stipulate care and consideration for minority ethnic groups. I believe that when the Tibetan people see the draft constitution, they will be as happy as a peacock hearing the light thunder of early summer.

    Ranba Nangji Wangdui said in an interview: I am particularly happy about the publication of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China." This shows that the Chinese Communist Party has led all ethnic groups in our country to achieve unprecedented great victories. The content of the draft constitution provides meticulous consideration for the interests of our minority ethnic groups, and guarantees that all ethnic groups have a bright future for development. We must use practical actions to strengthen unity with fraternal ethnic groups, strengthen unity within the Tibetan ethnic group, and thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet to express our support for the draft constitution.

    Luowang said in an interview: The "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" reflects the interests and aspirations of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and makes practical provisions for safeguarding the interests of minority ethnic groups. I fully agree with and support it, and sincerely thank Chairman Mao. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西藏在北京的藏族人士朵噶·彭错饶杰等
    热诚拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案
    西藏在北京的藏族人士朵噶·彭错饶杰、纳旺金巴、噶章·罗桑仁增和西藏达赖驻京办事处处长然巴·囊吉旺堆、班禅驻京办事处代处长罗旺等，热诚赞同“中华人民共和国宪法草案”，并分别向记者畅谈了他们的感想。
    一九五三年西藏国庆观礼团团长朵噶·彭错饶杰在谈话中说：我对伟大的“中华人民共和国宪法草案”完全同意并衷心拥护。在宪法草案里，从头到尾贯穿了人民民主精神，贯穿了祖国各民族平等、团结、友爱、互助的精神；它将成为各族人民幸福生活的源泉。在宪法草案里，又规定了各民族都有发展自己的语言文字的自由，都有保持或改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。宪法草案将受到西藏僧俗人民的热烈赞同。
    他说：这部伟大的宪法草案，是在毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导下产生的。只有在祖国各民族平等幸福的时代，才能作到。使我们更深刻感到祖国大家庭的可爱。过去反动统治者也曾制定过“宪法”，但对于我们少数民族是加重歧视和侮蔑。今天我们的宪法草案，不但内容完全符合各族人民利益，起草的过程也是充分民主的。我自己就参加了
  “中华人民共和国宪法草案（初稿）”的讨论。我也因而感到荣幸！
    观礼团副团长纳旺金巴在谈话中说：“中华人民共和国宪法草案”体现着伟大祖国对各少数民族的深切关怀，表明中国共产党、毛主席的光辉照耀着祖国各民族。在反动统治时期，我们西藏人民对政治如同瞎子一般。解放后，我们已开始走上了光明的大道，今后我们在祖国大家庭里，将得到更加幸福的生活。
    观礼团副团长噶章·罗桑仁增在谈话中说：“中华人民共和国宪法草案”是祖国各族人民共同利益的基础，它将成为保障各民族利益的宝贝。宪法草案的许多条文里，都规定着对少数民族的关心照顾，我相信，藏族人民看了宪法草案，会像孔雀听到初夏的轻雷一样喜欢。
    然巴·囊吉旺堆在谈话中说：“中华人民共和国宪法草案”的公布使我特别高兴。这表明中国共产党领导我们全国各族人民获得了空前伟大的胜利。宪法草案内容对我们少数民族的利益照顾无微不至，保证各民族有光明的发展前途。我们要用加强和兄弟民族的团结、加强西藏民族内部团结、彻底执行和平解放西藏办法的协议的实际行动，来表示对宪法草案的拥护。
    罗旺在谈话中说：“中华人民共和国宪法草案”反映了祖国各族人民的利益和愿望，对于保障少数民族的利益做了切实规定。我完全同意和拥护，并衷心感激毛主席。　（新华社）
