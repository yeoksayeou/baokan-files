Actively Adopt Substitutes Like Fresh Sweet Potatoes for Winemaking
Five State-Owned Distilleries Save 40 Million Jin of Grain Since This Spring

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The five state-owned distilleries under the Central Ministry of Light Industry have adopted various substitutes for grain in winemaking, saving a large amount of grain.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Light Industry, the grain saved by five distilleries, including Tianjin Distillery, the two Jinan Alcohol Factories (from January to April), Beijing Distillery, and Tianjin Alcohol Factory (from January to May), is more than 40.084 million jin, with a total value of wine produced (at market prices) of 213.4 billion yuan.

The substitutes used by these five distilleries mainly include ten types of materials such as fresh sweet potatoes, dried sweet potatoes, fresh potatoes, black dates, rice dregs, broken rice, cassava chips, red sorghum bran, starch, and rotten oranges. Although most of these substitutes had not been used by these factories in the past, and many workers initially had some concerns, thanks to the encouragement and support of the Party, workers and technicians worked hard to overcome the operational difficulties of the new raw materials, greatly improving and exceeding the state-stipulated grain-based winemaking targets. The state stipulates that for every jin of 65-proof liquor produced, 2.6 jin of grain (sorghum or corn) should be used (calculated based on 62% starch content), while using fresh sweet potatoes or fresh potatoes, the equivalent grain required is only 1.14 jin; for every jin of 96-proof alcohol, more than 3 jin of grain is required, while only 2.13 jin of dried sweet potatoes are needed. The quality of the wine made with substitutes is also very good.

The Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry is currently studying the use of acorns for winemaking. Currently, the Nanyang Alcohol Factory in Henan Province has successfully trial-produced alcohol using acorns. Small-scale experiments at the Nanyang Alcohol Factory have proven that there are no difficulties in using wheat bran koji for saccharification, and oak trees (also known as Quercus, Quercus variabilis, Quercus dentata, or Quercus mongolica) are found throughout the country. It is estimated that the yield is several hundred million jin. If local governments can mobilize farmers in mountainous areas to collect acorns, remove the shells, dry them, and grind them into powder, it can be supplied to nearby wineries as raw material. Its utilization value is equivalent to more than 75% of grain, and if fully utilized, it can save several hundred million jin of grain each year.

### 积极采用鲜白薯等代用品酿酒  五个国营酒厂今春以来节约粮食四千万斤

    积极采用鲜白薯等代用品酿酒
    五个国营酒厂今春以来节约粮食四千万斤
   【本报讯】中央轻工业部所属五个国营酒厂采用各种代用品代替粮食酿酒，节约了大量粮食。
    根据轻工业部的统计，天津酿酒厂、济南两个酒精厂（一月到四月）、北京酿酒厂和天津酒精厂
  （一月到五月）等五个酒厂节约的粮食在四千零八十四万斤以上，产酒总值（按市场价格）为二千一百三十四亿元。
    这五个酒厂使用的代用品主要是鲜白薯、白薯干、鲜马铃薯、黑枣、米?、碎米、木薯干、红粱糠、淀粉及腐烂桔子等十种。虽然这些代用品各厂过去大都未使用过，开始时不少职工在思想上还有些顾虑，但由于工人和技术人员们在党的鼓励和支持下，努力钻研，终于克服了新原料在操作中的困难，大大地提高并超过了国家规定的粮食造酒指标。国家规定酿制六十五度酒一斤，使用粮食（高粱或玉米）为二斤六两（按含百分之六十二的淀粉计算），而用鲜白薯或鲜马铃薯折合粮食，只要一斤十四两；每斤九十六度的酒精用粮食要三斤以上，而用白薯干只要二斤十三两。用代用品制成的酒的质量也很好。
    中央轻工业部烟酒工业管理局正在研究用橡籽酿酒。现在，河南省南阳酒精厂用橡籽制酒精已试制成功。从南阳酒精厂小型试验证明，糖化时用麸皮曲并无困难，且橡树（又名栎、麻栎、青岗或柞树）全国各地都有，估计产量有数亿斤，如各地政府能发动山地的农民采集橡籽，将壳去掉，把它晒干磨成粉，就可以供给就近酒厂作原料，它的利用价值相当于粮食的百分之七十五以上，能全部利用，每年节约的粮食将有数亿斤之巨。
