Anshan Iron and Steel Hot Blast Stove Bricklaying Project Completed
    The lining project for six hot blast stoves of two blast furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) was completed on May 21st, nine days ahead of schedule, with 8,100 tons of bricklaying completed.
    The progress of this project was very rapid. Last year, the bricklaying task for the construction of the No. 7 blast furnace body and three hot blast stoves was 6,000 tons, and more than 500 workers worked for nearly nine months to complete it. This year, the bricklaying task for six hot blast stoves was completed by 250 workers in six months. The quality of bricklaying this year generally exceeded the quality of bricklaying for the No. 7 blast furnace built last year. For example, the ash seams of the combustion chamber were all less than two millimeters. This will greatly extend the life of the hot blast stove.

Northeast Petroleum No. 2 Plant Puts Part of Crude Oil Furnaces into Production
    A portion of the crude oil furnaces at the Northeast Petroleum No. 2 Plant, which began to be restored last year, were officially put into production on June 1st, one month ahead of schedule.
    On this day, the production staff started up various machines that had just been inspected. The crushers and crude oil furnaces, which had been idle for nearly nine years, greedily swallowed carloads of oil shale like a person who had just recovered their health, chewing them desperately and continuously spitting out crude oil. In order to celebrate the early official commissioning of the crude oil furnaces and take on the glorious task of national construction, the workers hung lanterns and decorations and beat gongs and drums on June 1st to transport the produced crude oil to Northeast Petroleum No. 1 Plant in tank cars for processing and refining.

Luoyang and Xinxiang Cities Expand Power Plants
    Local state-owned power plants in Luoyang and Xinxiang cities, Henan Province, are actively expanding. The Luoyang Power Plant will install two generators this year, one of which is under construction and can generate electricity in the third quarter. The Xinxiang Power Plant will install three generators this year, one of which has begun installation and can generate electricity in the fourth quarter. With the expansion of these two power plants, high-voltage power transmission lines will be erected from Luoyang to the Longmen Coal Mine south of Luoyang, from Luoyang to the Gongxian Xiaoyi Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory east of Luoyang, and from Xinxiang to the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, delivering ample power to these factories and mines.

Sichuan's First Oil Exploration Well Drilling Completed
    The drilling workers of Sichuan's first oil exploration well sent the drill bit into the deepest stratum specified for drilling on May 17th. People on the well site are now working nervously to prepare for the work of lowering the casing, pouring cement, and solidifying the well, preparing to hand over the well. The electrical survey team has already started electrical measurements underground. Soon, the oil testing team will conduct oil and gas testing work here. After these tasks are completed, the oil and gas storage value of this exploration well can be determined.

The First Phase of Expansion Project of the State-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill Completed
    The first phase of the expansion project of the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill has been completed and officially put into production. The expanded mechanical pulp workshop is three times larger than the original, and can accommodate eight giant wood grinders and other auxiliary equipment, preparing for the next phase of expansion. In the past, the factory's mechanical pulp production was small and could not meet the needs of the paper machines, nor could it produce chemical pulp itself. Now, two of China's newest and largest chain-type wood grinders have been installed, and a chemical pulp cooking pot has been restored. In the future, all pulp can be self-sufficient, and the potential of the paper machine can be effectively utilized, which will increase the factory's newsprint production by 60% this year compared to last year. The increased newsprint production this year can supply eight newspaper offices that publish 100,000 broadsheet newspapers daily for one year. The cost of newsprint will be reduced accordingly this year.

Construction of Factory Buildings for the New Jiamusi Sugar Factory Begins
    The Songjiang Provincial Local State-owned Jiamusi Sugar Factory, which began construction in July last year, began construction of factory buildings such as the repair shop, turbine room, and boiler room on May 20th.
    After the Jiamusi Sugar Factory started construction in July last year, it first built a dedicated railway line and part of the dormitories and warehouses, which have been completed. In mid-April this year, the factory continued to build part of the dormitories and canteens, and now the construction of factory buildings has also begun. This sugar factory has received strong support from all parties in the process of building the factory. The Songjiang Provincial People's Government transferred capable cadres and technicians to participate in the construction. The local state-owned Acheng Sugar Factory has begun to train a complete set of technicians for the new factory. The state-owned Shuguang Farm, Volgachi River Veterans Mechanical Farm, and Tangyuan Demonstration Breeding Farm near the factory have trial-planted dozens of hectares of sugar beets in order to provide high-quality sugar beet seeds with higher sugar content for large-scale cultivation of sugar beets in Huachuan, Tangyuan and other six counties next year.

Huainan Coal Mine Xiejiachi No. 3 Vertical Shaft to be Constructed
    Preparations for the construction of the Xiejiachi No. 3 vertical shaft of the Huainan Coal Mine are being stepped up. Various mechanical equipment for construction, such as winches, air compressors, rock grabbers, concrete mixers, caulking compound mixers, and various tools and machine tools, are being shipped to the construction site from Northeast China, Shanghai, Xiangtan, Tianjin, Beijing and other places. Among them, two large electric winches that are about to be shipped are new products that have been successfully trial-produced according to Soviet design for the first time. The construction of temporary factory buildings and workshops covering an area of 4,000 square meters on the construction site has now been completed by more than 2,850 square meters; the carpentry work of the temporary headframe has been basically completed; the electromechanical installation project is about to begin; and the self-made equipment using more than 60 tons of steel materials is being rushed by the Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory and the Huainan Mining Bureau Machinery General Repair Factory.
    The employees participating in the preparation for the construction of the new well have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm. The construction worker Cheng Tingxun's team braved the rain to erect a tarpaulin shed on the foundation of the air compressor, ensuring the smooth progress of the foundation pouring project. The temporary workshops that have been built on the construction site were mostly completed ahead of schedule.

Jiangxi Machinery Factory Expansion Project Progresses Rapidly
    The new factory building of the Jiangxi Machinery Factory will be completed one month ahead of schedule, and the forging and riveting workshops can be put into production in late June.
    Before liberation, the Jiangxi Machinery Factory was a small factory with only two lathes, a few incomplete old machines and twenty workers. After liberation, the number of workers and machinery equipment increased tenfold. In recent years, the Jiangxi Machinery Factory has manufactured a large number of water pumps, oxcart discs, threshing machines, new-style walking plows and sprayers for farmers throughout the province, and supported the province's basic construction. Due to the development of production and the increase in equipment and workers, the original factory buildings were insufficient. In order to further develop production, the factory decided to expand new factory buildings.
    The expansion project started comprehensively in mid-March. So far, about 50% of the entire construction project has been completed. The metalworking workshop is pouring cement columns and horizontal beams, and the internal water and electricity installation of the office building and single dormitories has begun.

Dashagou Gully Filling Project in Wushaoling Area Completed
    Another key project in the Wushaoling area of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the Dashagou Gully Filling Project, was completed on May 31st, one month ahead of schedule, after 173 days of intensive construction.
    Dashagou is a deep gully 200 meters wide and 44 meters high. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway passes through the Wushaoling Tunnel and is blocked by this deep gully 25 kilometers to the west. This is a sixth-degree seismic zone. If a viaduct of more than 40 meters high were to be built, it would be destroyed by earthquakes. Therefore, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways decided, based on advanced Soviet experience, to fill 440,000 cubic meters of soil into this deep gully to make it a flat roadbed. A 1.5-meter-high channel of more than 7,000 cubic meters of rubble was built at the bottom of the roadbed to stabilize the roadbed foundation and temporarily drain water before the culvert is completed.
    The Dashagou project started on December 8th last year. Under the constant attacks of blizzards, the hands and ears of the workers sitting in the driver's seats of bulldozers or scraper-loaders were often frostbitten, but no one complained. They not only insisted on working day and night, but also used their brains to create many advanced working methods, such as proposing a "cyclic maintenance method" in terms of mechanical maintenance, and proposing "frozen soil excavation method" and "parallel bulldozing method" to improve the efficiency of soil shoveling and transportation. The implementation of the "parallel bulldozing method" alone increased work efficiency by 25%.

    向社会主义工业化目标奋勇前进
    鞍钢热风炉砌砖工程竣工
    鞍钢两个高炉的六座热风炉内衬工程已于五月二十一日提前九天完成了八千一百吨砌砖任务。
    这项工程进展很迅速。去年修建七高炉炉体和三座热风炉的砌砖任务是六千吨，五百余名工人干了近九个月才完成。今年六座热风炉的砌砖任务，二百五十名工人工作六个月就全部完成了。今年砌砖的质量普遍超过了去年修建的七高炉的砌砖质量。如燃烧室灰缝全部小于两粍。这样将大大延长热风炉的寿命。
    东北石油二厂部分原油炉子投入生产
    东北石油二厂去年开始恢复的一部分原油炉子，在六月一日正式投入生产。比原计划提前了一个月。
    这天，生产人员开动了刚验收的各种机器。搁置了将近九年的破碎机和原油炉子，像刚恢复健康的人一样，贪馋地大口吞进成车的油母页岩，拚命地咀嚼后，又源源不断地吐出原油来。工人们为了庆祝原油炉子提前正式投入生产，为国家建设肩负起光荣任务，在六月一日这一天特挂灯结彩，锣鼓喧天地把已经生产出来的原油用油槽车送到东北石油一厂去加工精制。
    洛阳、新乡两市扩建发电厂
    河南省洛阳、新乡两市的地方国营发电厂正在积极扩建。洛阳发电厂今年要安装两部发电机，其中一部正在紧张施工，第三季度可以发电。新乡发电厂今年要安装三部发电机，其中一部已开始安装，第四季度可以发电。随着这两个发电厂的扩建，从洛阳到洛阳南面的龙门煤矿，从洛阳到洛阳东面的巩县孝义机制砖瓦厂，从新乡到焦作煤矿，都将架设高压送电线，把充足的电力送到这些工厂矿山中去。
    四川第一口石油探井钻探完工
    四川第一口石油探井的钻探工人们，已在五月十七日把钻头送进了规定钻探的最深地层。井场上的人们正紧张地准备着下套管、浇灌水泥固井的工作，准备交井。电测队已经着手在井下电测，不久，试油队就要在这里进行试油、试气的工作。这些工作完成以后，这口探井储油、储气价值就可以确定了。
    国营广州造纸厂第一期扩建工程完工
    国营广州造纸厂第一期扩建工程已经完成，正式投入生产。经扩建后的机械木浆车间比原来的面积大三倍，可容纳八台巨型磨木机及其他附属设备，为下一步扩建工程作好了准备。该厂过去机械木浆产量较小，不能满足抄纸机的需要，也不能自制化学木浆。现在新安装了两台我国最新式的、最大的链条式磨木机，以及恢复了一个化学木浆蒸煮锅，今后全部浆料可以自给，抄纸机的潜力可以有效地发挥，这使该厂今年新闻纸的产量将比去年增加百分之六十。今年该厂增产的新闻纸可以供给八家每日发行十万份对开报纸的报社使用一年。今年新闻纸的成本将随而降低。
    新建佳木斯制糖厂厂房工程开始动工
    去年七月开始动工的松江省地方国营佳木斯制糖厂，从五月二十日起开始建设检修厂、透平室、锅炉室等厂房工程。
    佳木斯制糖厂在去年七月动工后，先建设铁路专用线和一部分宿舍、仓库，这些工程已经完工。今年四月中旬，这个厂继续建设部分宿舍和食堂，现在，厂房工程也开始动工了。这座糖厂在建厂过程中得到了各方面有力的支援，松江省人民政府抽调了得力的干部和技术人员去参加建设。地方国营阿城糖厂已开始为这个新厂培养全套的技术工人。在这个厂附近的国营曙光农场、伏尔基河荣军机械农场和汤原示范繁殖场等已试种了几十垧甜菜，以便为明年在桦川、汤原等六个县大量栽培甜菜时提供含糖率较高的优良的甜菜种子。
    淮南煤矿谢家集三号竖井将开工修建
    淮南煤矿谢家集三号竖井施工准备工作正加紧进行。施工用的各种机械设备，如绞车、压风机、抓岩机、混凝土拌和机、胶泥拌和机及各种工具和工作母机等，正从东北、上海、湘潭、天津、北京等地源源运抵工地。其中即将运到的两部大型电绞车，是按照苏联设计第一次试制成功的新产品。工地上四千平方公尺的临时厂房和工房的建筑工程，现已完成两千八百五十多平方公尺；临时井架的木工工程已基本完成；机电安装工程即将开始；六十多吨钢铁材料的自制设备，正由蔡家岗矿山机械厂和淮南矿务局机械总修理厂加紧制造中。
    参加新井施工准备的职工们，发挥了高度的劳动积极性。建筑工人程廷勋小组，曾冒雨抢搭压风机基础上的帆布棚，保证了浇灌基础工程顺利进行。在工地已建成的临时工房，大部提前完工。
    江西机械厂扩建工程进展很快
    江西机械厂扩建的新厂房将提前一个月完成，锻、铆两大车间六月下旬即可投入生产。
    江西机械厂在解放前是一个只有两部车床，几部残缺不全的旧机器和二十几个工人的小厂。解放后，工人和机器设备都增加了十几倍。几年来，江西机械厂为全省农民制造了大批的抽水机、牛车盘、打谷机、新式步犁和喷雾器，并支援了本省的基本建设。由于生产发展、设备和工人增多，原有厂房不敷应用。该厂为进一步发展生产，决定扩建新厂房。
    扩建工程在三月中旬全面开工。到目前为止，全部建筑工程已完成百分之五十左右。金工车间正在浇灌水泥柱子、平梁，办公大楼和单人宿舍已开始内部水电安装。
    乌鞘岭地区大沙沟填沟工程竣工
    兰新铁路乌鞘岭地区又一重点工程——大沙沟填沟工程，经过一百七十三天的紧张施工，已于五月三十一日，比原计划提前一个月竣工。
    大沙沟是一个二百公尺宽、四十四公尺高的深沟，兰新铁路穿过乌鞘岭大隧道，西下二十五公里，便被这个深沟所阻。这里是六级地震区，要是修建一座四十公尺以上的高架桥，就会遭到地震的破坏，为此，铁道部第一工程局根据苏联先进经验，决定在这个深沟里填进四十四万方土，使它成为一条平坦的路基。并在路基的底部砌成一个七千多方片石、一公尺五高的沟道，以稳定路基基础，并在泄水洞未修好以前起暂时排水的作用。
    大沙沟工程从去年十二月八日开工，在暴风雪不断的侵袭下，坐在推土机或铲运机司机台里的工人们，手和耳朵常常被冻裂了，但是，没有人叫过苦。他们不仅不分昼夜的坚持工作，而且还开动脑筋创造许多先进工作法，如在机械保养方面提出
  “循环保养法”，在提高铲土、运土工作效率方面提出“冻土开挖法”、“并排推土法”等，仅“并排推土法”推行以后，就提高工作效率百分之二十五。
