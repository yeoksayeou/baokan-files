    Beijing to Stock Rivers and Lakes Throughout the City with a Large Number of Fish Fry

    Beijing will utilize more than 6,000 mu of existing river and lake area throughout the city to stock a large number of delicious fish fry, including silver carp, bighead carp, and grass carp. The first batch of fish fry has already been transported from Wuhan and released into Zizhuyuan Lake.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Parks and Woods Department manages more than 5,000 mu of water surface, including Kunming Lake and Beihai, where the water depth is between three and five feet, the water temperature is suitable, and the water quality is relatively fertile, providing conditions for fish farming. The Parks and Woods Department plans to stock these rivers and lakes with more than 2 million silver carp, bighead carp, and grass carp fry. According to the growth patterns of silver carp, bighead carp, and grass carp, they can grow to an average length of three inches in the first year and more than one jin in the second year. It is estimated that by the autumn of 1955, after deducting losses, more than 1 million jin of edible fish can be raised. Thereafter, if fishing is carried out in rotation every year, around 1 million jin of fresh fish can still be caught annually.

    In addition, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and the Yi Nong Farm will also cultivate a batch of fish fry near Dapaizi. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市将运用全市河湖
    放养大批鱼苗
    北京市将运用全市六千多亩现有河湖面积，放养大批肉质鲜美的鲢、鳙、鲩等鱼苗。现在第一批鱼苗已经从武汉运到，放养到紫竹院湖中。
    北京市人民政府园林处共管理水面五千多亩，其中如昆明湖、北海等地，水深都在三尺到五尺，水温适当，水质较肥，具有养鱼条件。园林处计划在这些河湖中放养鲢、鳙、鲩等鱼苗二百多万尾。按照鲢、鳙、鲩等鱼类的生长规律，第一年平均可以长到三寸长，二年后可以长到一斤多重，估计到一九五五年秋季，除去损失数字可养成食用鱼一百多万斤。以后如每年轮番放捕，每年仍可捕得鲜鱼一百万斤左右。
    此外，北京市人民政府农林局和义农场，也将在大泡子附近养殖鱼苗一批。　（新华社）
