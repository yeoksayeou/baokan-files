Xinhua News Agency, June 24th, Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram publicly stated on the 21st that Thailand is prepared to provide military bases and cannon fodder to the United States, serving American intervention in the Indochina War and aggression in Southeast Asia.

After inspecting the northern provinces of Thailand, where war preparations are underway, and returning to Bangkok, Plaek Phibunsongkhram said at a press conference on the 21st that if the "United Nations" decides to send troops to Indochina, as in the Korean War, Thailand is willing to assist to the best of its ability. He stated that Thailand welcomes the United States and its satellite countries to Thailand and is willing to participate in the Southeast Asian military bloc planned by the United States, carrying out any aggressive actions that the United States attempts to manipulate the United Nations into conducting in Southeast Asia.

In his speech, Plaek Phibunsongkhram also explained that the Thai government is expanding the Thai armed forces according to the wishes of the United States for American use. He said that, according to the agreement signed with the United States, Thailand will soon receive more American aircraft and more American personnel to train the Thai army. He revealed that the Thai government intends to expand the national "volunteer corps," which is actually an army with the nature of a reserve force forcibly recruited by the Thai government after the United States demanded in January that Thailand double its army. Plaek Phibunsongkhram even hinted at forcibly conscripting overseas Chinese in Thailand, using them "as a source of troops."

It is worth noting that while Plaek Phibunsongkhram issued the above clamor, the United States and Thailand are intensifying their collusion. The United States Ambassador to Thailand, Edwin F. Stanton, recently returned to the United States for activities. He met with U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The content of the talks and his other activities are kept strictly secret.

A Thai military delegation led by Thai Deputy Minister of Defense Nai Sarit is also about to go to Washington at the summons of the United States. According to a report by the United Press, U.S. officials in Washington said that the delegation will negotiate with the United States on the issue of doubling the number of Thai ground troops and equipping the Thai Air Force with jet fighters and light bombers.

    泰国总理銮披汶公开表示要为美国的侵略活动效劳
    【新华社二十四日讯】曼谷消息：泰国总理銮披汶二十一日公开表示，泰国准备向美国提供军事基地和炮灰，为美国干涉印度支那战争和侵略东南亚地区的行动效劳。
    銮披汶在视察了正进行备战活动的泰国北部各府回到曼谷后，二十一日在记者招待会上说，如果
  “联合国”决定像朝鲜事件一样，派军队去印度支那，泰国愿意尽其所能来协助。他表示，泰国欢迎美国及其仆从国军队到泰国去，并愿意参加美国策划中的东南亚军事集团，执行美国企图操纵联合国在东南亚进行的任何侵略行动。
    銮披汶在谈话中并说明，泰国政府正在按照美国的意旨扩充泰国武装部队，以供美国使用。他说，根据和美国签订的协定，泰国不久要得到更多的美国飞机和更多的美国人员来训练泰国军队。他透露，泰国政府打算扩充全国的“志愿队”，这种
  “志愿队”实际上是美国一月间要求泰国扩充军队一倍后由泰国政府强迫征募的带有后备队性质的军队。銮披汶甚至暗示要强征在泰国的华侨，把他们“作为兵力的来源”。
    值得注意的是，在銮披汶发出上述叫嚣的同时，美国和泰国正在加紧勾搭。美国驻泰国大使杜诺万最近又一次回到美国活动。他曾和美国总统艾森豪威尔会谈。谈话内容以及他的其他活动都严守秘密。
    由泰国国防部副部长乃沙立率领的一个泰国军事代表团，奉美国的召唤，也即将前往华盛顿。据合众社报道，华盛顿的美国官员说，这个代表团将和美国谈判使泰国地面部队增加一倍并以喷气式战斗机和轻轰炸机装备泰国空军的问题。
