Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 10th: Most of the major industrial products of state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private industrial enterprises in the Northwest region completed or exceeded their May production plans. Specifically, raw coal completed 102.58 percent, crude oil completed 117.91 percent, gasoline completed 128 percent, kerosene completed 190 percent, and cotton yarn completed 107.66 percent. Fifteen factories and mines in the state-owned coal, electricity, petroleum, machinery, and cotton textile systems completed 106.39 percent of their total output value plan. According to incomplete statistics, twenty-seven factories and mines among the locally state-owned and jointly state-private factories and mines completed their output value plans.

    Various factories and mines have also made great achievements in saving raw materials and reducing costs. The Northwest No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, the Shaanxi No. 1 Joint State-Private Cotton Textile Factory, and the Shaanxi No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory experimented with fiber impurity separators, resulting in savings of about two catties of cotton per yarn. If these three factories were to promote this method universally, more than 19,000 catties of cotton could be saved each month. The Northwest No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory began using substitutes as raw materials for sizing yarn in May. Preliminary calculations show that 1 billion yuan can be saved annually, and the quality of yarn and cloth can also be improved.
   
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 9th: Forty-nine state-owned factories in Shenyang City exceeded the state's May gross production value plan by 6.2 percent. In local state-owned industries, thirty-eight factories also completed their gross production value plans in May.

    In May, various state-owned machinery and electrical factories in Shenyang appropriately revised their production plans according to the needs of national construction. The Shenyang Transformer Factory, Water Pump Factory, and Air Compressor Factory, among others, reduced the output of small products and increased the trial production of large new products. In order to meet the needs of the coal mine departments to improve underground transportation conditions, the Mining Machinery Factory produced three more scraper conveyors this month than in April and completed the trial production of two new belt conveyors. Light industrial factories and local state-owned factories have made many improvements in saving raw materials and reducing costs. The Shenyang Electrical Materials Factory successfully produced self-made bakelite powder, solving the problem of raw material sources for bakelite products, and it is estimated that 2.5 billion yuan can be saved in material costs annually. The Shenyang Weighing Instrument Factory improved the material requisition and return system and rationally used the remaining materials, which also reduced the cost of various products.

    西北主要工业产品上月生产计划大部完成
    沈阳八十多个工厂完成五月份产值计划
   【新华社西安十日电】西北区国营、地方国营和公私合营工业主要产品，大部分完成或超额完成了五月份生产计划。计原煤完成百分之一百零二点五八，原油完成百分之一百一十七点九一，汽油完成百分之一百二十八，煤油完成百分之一百九十，棉纱完成百分之一百零七点六六。国营煤、电、石油、机械、棉纺织系统的十五个厂矿完成总产值计划百分之一百零六点三九。地方国营和公私合营厂矿中，根据不完全统计，有二十七个厂矿完成了产值计划。
    各厂矿在节约原料、降低成本方面也取得很大成效。国营西北第一棉纺织厂、公私合营陕西第一棉纺织厂和陕西第二棉纺织厂试用纤维杂质分离机的结果，使一件纱可节省棉花两斤左右，如果这三个厂普遍推广，每月可节省棉花一万九千多斤。国营西北第一棉纺织厂五月份开始使用代用品做浆纱原料，初步计算每年可节省十亿元，而且纱、布的质量还可提高。
   【新华社沈阳九日电】沈阳市有四十九个国营工厂超额百分之六点二完成了五月份国家生产总值计划。地方国营工业中，五月份也有三十八个工厂完成了生产总值计划。
    五月份，沈阳各国营机械、电器工厂按照国家建设需要，都适当地修改了生产计划。沈阳变压器厂、水泵厂和空气压缩机厂等都减少了小型产品的产量，增加了大型新产品的试制工作。矿山机器厂为了满足煤矿部门改善井下运输条件的需要，这个月里比四月份多生产了三台刮板运输机，并完成了两种新皮带运输机的试制工作。轻工业工厂和地方国营工厂，在节省原材料、降低成本方面作了许多改进。沈阳市电器材料厂自制电木粉成功，解决了电木制品的原料来源问题，预计一年可节省材料费二十五亿元。沈阳衡器厂健全领料退料制度，合理地使用截剩下来的材料，也减少了各种产品的成本费用。
