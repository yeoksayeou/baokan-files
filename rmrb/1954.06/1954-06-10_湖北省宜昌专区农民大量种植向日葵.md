Farmers in Yichang Prefecture, Hubei Province, are responding to the government's call to extensively plant sunflowers, utilizing vacant spaces beside houses, at the edges of fields, and around ponds. Generally, each household plants more than ten plants, with some planting over a hundred. Based on the number of seeds already sown in various areas, it is estimated that farmers throughout the prefecture will sell one million jin of sunflower seeds to the state in the autumn, which will be a significant new income for the farmers.

Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and rural Party and Youth League members have taken the lead in responding to the call for planting sunflowers. Fan Yiying, the deputy head of Dianjun Township in Yichang, took the lead in mobilizing her entire family to plant more than fifty plants. Youth League member Zhao Changxiu planted more than eighty plants on field embankments and barren dams by herself. Under their influence, a planting movement of "one plant per person" was launched throughout the township. All sixty-two agricultural production cooperatives in the prefecture planted an average of more than four hundred plants each.

The staff of the Yichang Prefectural Party Committee and the directly affiliated organs and organizations of the Yichang Prefectural Commissioner's Office also used their spare time to plant sunflowers in the vacant spaces around the organs. The cadres of the Prefectural Party Committee organs planted more than twenty plants each. (Xiao Chuanrong)

    湖北省宜昌专区农民大量种植向日葵
    湖北省宜昌专区农民响应政府号召，利用宅边、地头、田边、塘角等空地大量种植向日葵。一般每户都种十棵以上，多的种有一百多棵。根据各地已经播种数量，估计秋后全区农民可卖给国家一百万斤葵花子，这是农民们一笔很大的新收入。
    农业生产合作社、互助组以及农村党、团员，都带头响应了种植向日葵的号召，宜昌点军乡副乡长范一英首先动员全家种了五十多棵，青年团员赵长秀一个人在田堤荒坝上种了八十多棵，在他们影响下，全乡掀起了一人一棵的种植运动。全专区六十二个农业生产合作社，平均每社都种了四百多棵。
    中共宜昌地委和宜昌专署直属机关、团体的工作人员，也利用工作余暇，把机关周围的空地都种上了向日葵，地委机关的干部每人都种了二十多棵。　　（萧传荣）
