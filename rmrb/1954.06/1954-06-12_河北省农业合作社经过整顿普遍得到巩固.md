Hebei Province's more than 31,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been largely consolidated after vigorous rectification in April and May.

According to incomplete statistics from seven special districts, out of 24,108 cooperatives, 19,601 have been rectified, accounting for 81.3 percent. All cooperatives that have undergone rectification have improved in quality.

In the work of rectifying the cooperatives, all localities generally focused on increasing production, helped the agricultural production cooperatives to formulate and revise practical and feasible plans for increasing production, thereby arousing the production enthusiasm of the members, and pushing the cooperatives forward from the perspective of production. For example, the Chen Rui Cooperative in Nanzhang Village, Mancheng County, mobilized its members to tap the potential for increased production, and found nine ways to increase production, including expanding paddy fields, leveling slopes, building more public pigsties, and promoting artificial pollination of corn, which could increase grain production by more than 12,500 kilograms, with each household receiving more than 770 kilograms more.

In the process of rectification, the class line of the Party in rural work was conscientiously implemented, the class consciousness of the members was raised, and the organization of the cooperatives was purified. In many agricultural production cooperatives in Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Tongxian, and Dingxian special districts, landlords, rich peasants, and reactionary leaders who had infiltrated the cooperatives have been purged.

In order to improve labor organization, the "contract labor system" was universally promoted during the rectification, which overcame and reduced the phenomena of idling and absenteeism in the cooperatives, and improved production efficiency. For example, after the Luojiagou Cooperative in Pinggu County implemented the "contract labor system," it saved more than 30 man-days and more than 60 animal-days during spring plowing and sowing alone.

While consolidating agricultural production cooperatives, various localities have also rectified and developed mutual aid teams. The number of organized farmers in the province has increased from 42 percent to more than 50 percent. Due to the strengthening of education in collectivist ideology, a new atmosphere of unity and production has emerged in the countryside, with unity and production between villages, cooperatives, teams, and households. Seven cooperatives and twenty-one mutual aid teams in Yimen Village, Anping County, and seventeen cooperatives and sixty-one mutual aid teams in Gaoli Township, Xingtang County, have signed contracts for the exchange of manpower and animal power, financial exchanges, and technical assistance.

    河北省农业合作社经过整顿普遍得到巩固
    河北省三万一千多个农业生产合作社，经过四、五月份的大力整顿，大部都已巩固起来。
    据七个专区的不完全统计，二万四千一百零八个社，已经整顿了一万九千六百零一个，占百分之八十一点三。凡是经过整顿的社，质量上都有提高。
    各地在整顿社的工作中，一般掌握了从增产着眼，帮助农业生产合作社制订和修订切实可行的增产计划，从而激发起社员的生产积极性，从生产上把社向前推进一步。如满城县南章村陈瑞社，发动社员挖掘增产潜力，找出了扩大水田，平整坡地，增修公有猪圈，推行玉米人工授粉法等九种增产办法，共计能增产一万二千五百多斤粮食，每户多分七百七十多斤。
    在整顿过程中，认真贯彻执行了党在农村工作中的阶级路线，提高了社员的阶级觉悟，纯洁了社的组织。在石家庄、张家口、通县、定县四个专区的许多农业生产合作社内，已把混入社内的地主、富农和反动道首清洗出去。
    为了改进劳力组织，整顿时普遍推行了“包工制”，克服和减少了社内的窝工旷工现象，提高了生产效率。如平谷县罗家沟社实行“包工”后，只在春耕播种当中就节省了三十多个人工，六十多个畜工。
    各地在巩固农业生产合作社的同时，也整顿与发展了互助组，全省组织起来的农户已由百分之四十二，发展到百分之五十以上。由于加强了集体主义思想的教育，使农村出现了团结生产的新气象，村、社、组、户之间团结生产。安平县义门村七个社与二十一个互助组，行唐县高里乡十七个社与六十一个互助组，订立了人力、畜力换工、财务串换、技术互助的合同。
