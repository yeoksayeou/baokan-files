    Central and South China Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
    Vigorously Supply Production Materials
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in the Central and South China region are vigorously carrying out the work of supplying production materials. In the first quarter of this year, supply and marketing cooperatives in Central and South China have supplied farmers with more than 277,500 tons of various fertilizers, more than 7,000 new-style farm tools, more than 7,510,000 old-style farm tools, more than 9,000 head of draught animals, and a large number of pesticides and machinery, seeds, etc. The supply of fertilizer is five times that of the first quarter of last year. In the second quarter, the region plans to supply about 90 percent of the total fertilizer supplied last year; the number of farm tools to be supplied is about four times that of the total supplied last year. In April, the amount of production materials supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas increased significantly compared with the monthly average in the first quarter. For example, the fertilizer supplied by the Mi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province in early April accounted for 40 percent of the total supplied in the entire first quarter, and small farm tools accounted for half of the first quarter.
    In supplying production materials, supply and marketing cooperatives in Central and South China generally pay attention to combining it with the pre-purchase of agricultural products. The supply and marketing cooperatives of Chengnan Township, Yuhuang Township, and Panzhuang Township in Linru County, Henan Province, supplied farmers with production materials worth more than 62.6 million yuan while paying more than 95.9 million yuan in pre-purchase deposits to farmers. The No. 3 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, supplied farmers with chemical fertilizers, cake fertilizers, and large and small farm tools worth more than 17 million yuan in the pre-purchase of rice, accounting for 66.4 percent of the pre-purchase deposit.
    In order to ensure the completion of the supply plan for production materials in the second quarter, supply and marketing cooperatives in Central and South China are actively organizing local sources of goods. For example, the Xinhui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Guangdong Province organized farmers to collect night soil, cow bones, garbage, etc. locally, organized local handicraftsmen to manufacture farm tools for farmers, and held a cattle exchange fair.

    中南各地供销合作社
    大力供应生产资料
    中南区各地供销合作社大力进行生产资料供应工作。在今年第一季度中，中南各地供销合作社已供应给农民各种肥料二十七万七千五百余吨、新式农具七千多件、旧式农具七百五十一万多件、耕畜九千多头，以及大批农药械、种籽等。其中肥料的供应数量，相当于去年第一季度的五倍。第二季度，全区计划供应肥料的数量，约为去年全年供应量的百分之九十；准备供应农具的数量，为去年全年供应量的四倍左右。四月份，许多地区供销合作社供应生产资料的数量，比第一季度每月平均供应数量有显著增加。如河南省密县供销合作社在四月上旬供应的肥料，即为第一季度全季供应量的百分之四十，小农具为第一季度的一半。
    中南各地供销合作社在供应生产资料中，一般都注意结合农产品预购工作。河南省临汝县城北乡、玉皇乡、潘庄乡的供销合作社，在付给农民九千五百九十多万元预购定金的同时，供应了农民价值六千二百六十多万元的生产资料。广东省新会县第三区供销合作社在预购稻谷中，供应给农民价值一千七百多万元的化学肥料、饼肥、大小农具，占预购定金的百分之六十六点四。
    为了保证完成第二季度生产资料的供应计划，中南各地供销合作社正积极组织地方货源。如广东省新会县供销合作社组织农民就地收集大粪、牛骨、垃圾等，组织各地手工业者为农民制造农具，并举行了耕牛交流会。
