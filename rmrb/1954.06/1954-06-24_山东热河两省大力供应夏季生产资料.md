    Shandong and Rehe Provinces Vigorously Supply Summer Production Materials
    Before May, supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas of Shandong Province arranged for the supply of summer production materials. Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Heze and Wendeng Special Districts checked supply plans and inventories. Through inspection, the supply and marketing cooperative of Haiyang County expanded the supply plan for pesticides in the second quarter. According to incomplete statistics, in early and mid-May, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province supplied farmers with more than 400,500 pieces of old-style farm tools, more than 8,500 new-style farm tools and waterwheels, more than 321,000 jin of various pesticides, more than 4,100 sprayers, and more than 700,800 jin of various fertilizers. When supplying production materials, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places widely adopted methods such as holding small-scale material exchange meetings and signing combined contracts with organized farmers. In April, supply and marketing cooperatives in seven counties of Liaocheng Special District held 151 small-scale material exchange meetings, and signed 1,670 supply and marketing contracts with 37 agricultural production cooperatives and 154 mutual aid groups, supplying farmers with more than 160 waterwheels, more than 20 double-shared plows, more than 160 sprayers, more than 12,000 small farm tools, and more than 87,000 jin of chemical fertilizers.
    At present, the sales volume of summer production materials in various places is very large. The quantity of prepared production materials in Jinxiang, Xuecheng, and Ziyang counties is insufficient. These areas are adopting methods such as mutual adjustment, remelting and remanufacturing unqualified small farm tools, and organizing blacksmith shops to process them to solve this problem. Each grassroots cooperative in Jinxiang County has transferred 1,500 sickles and a batch of brooms and other agricultural tools; Yutai County has transferred more than 900 small agricultural tools such as wooden forks, wooden shovels, and brooms, which solved the phenomenon of backlog in one cooperative and out of stock in another. The No. 8 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Ziyang County remelted and remanufactured 300 hoe blades and a part of chaff cutters that did not meet the needs of farmers.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Rehe Province are actively preparing and supplying summer production materials. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of May, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in the province had prepared more than 370,000 pieces of various summer hoeing farm tools, more than 3,200 shovel cultivators, more than 600 waterwheels, more than 2,358,000 jin of insecticides, and more than 14,000 pieces of agricultural machinery, as well as a batch of fertilizers and seeds. These materials have begun to be supplied to farmers.
    For the summer hoeing farm tools that are in short supply locally but urgently needed by farmers, supply and marketing cooperatives in many counties have adopted methods such as mutual adjustment, purchasing from other places, and organizing handicraftsmen to produce them to ensure supply as much as possible. Farmers in Xinglong County requested the supply of new-style small weeding hoes produced in Zunhua County, Hebei Province. In April, the county cooperative federation purchased 150 units from the Zunhua County Local State-Owned Dazhong Iron Factory. Supply and marketing cooperatives in 12 counties and banners including Chifeng, Qinglong, and Pingquan signed more than 550 processing and ordering contracts for hoe blades, weeding hoes, and hoe hooks with local handicraftsmen, with a total value of 3.76 billion yuan.

    山东热河两省大力供应夏季生产资料
    山东省许多地区的供销合作社在五月份以前，就安排了夏季生产资料供应工作。菏泽专区、文登专区等地许多供销合作社对供应计划和存货等进行了检查。海阳县的供销合作社通过检查，即扩大了第二季度的农药供应计划。据不完全统计，在五月上、中旬，全省各地供销合作社已供应给农民各种旧式农具四十万零五千多件，新式农具和水车八千五百多部，各种农药三十二万一千多斤，喷雾器四千一百多具，各种肥料七十万八千多斤。各地供销合作社在供应生产资料时，广泛采用了召开小型物资交流会，和组织起来的农民签订结合合同等办法。聊城专区七个县的供销合作社在四月份召开了一百五十一次小型物资交流会，同时和三十七个农业生产合作社、一百五十四个互助组签订供销合同一千六百七十件，供应农民水车一百六十多部，双铧犁二十余部，喷雾器一百六十余具，小农具一万二千多件，化学肥料八万七千多斤。
    目前，各地夏季生产资料的销售数量很大。金乡、薛城、滋阳等县有的生产资料准备的数量已感不足。这些地区正采取互相调剂、将不合规格的小农具回炉改制、组织铁匠炉加工等办法，来解决这一问题。金乡县各基层合作社之间已调剂了一千五百把镰刀及一批扫帚等农具；鱼台县调剂木杈、木锨、扫帚等小农具九百多件，解决了此社积压、彼社脱销的现象。滋阳县第八区供销合作社将规格不合农民需要的锄板三百个及一部分铡刀等进行了回炉改制。

    热河省各地供销合作社积极进行夏季生产资料的准备与供应工作。据不完全统计，全省各级供销合作社到五月底止，已备妥各种夏锄农具三十七万多件，铲?机三千二百多台，水车六百多部，杀虫药剂二百三十五万八千多斤，农业药械一万四千多件，此外还有一批肥料和种籽等。这些物资，已开始向农民供应。
    对于当地数量不足而又为农民迫切需要的夏锄农具，许多县的供销合作社采用互相调剂、去外地采购和组织手工业者生产等办法，保证尽量供应。兴隆县农民要求供应河北省遵化县出产的新式小耘锄，该县合作社联合社在四月份即向遵化县地方国营大众铁工厂购进一百五十台。赤峰、青龙、平泉等十二个县、旗的供销合作社和当地手工业者签订了锄板、耘锄、锄钩等加工订货合同五百五十多份，总值达三十七亿六千多万元。（曾映泉　王洪顺）
