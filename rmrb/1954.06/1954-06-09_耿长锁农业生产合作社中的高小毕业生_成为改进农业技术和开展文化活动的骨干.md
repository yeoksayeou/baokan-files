Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 8th: The thirty-four senior primary school graduates in the agricultural production cooperative led by Geng Changsuo in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, Hebei Province, have become the backbone in improving agricultural techniques and carrying out cultural activities. Among them, one was elected as the vice-chairman of the cooperative, two became production team leaders, five are learning to drive tractors, nine are learning to dig new-style wells, two are working as agricultural technicians, two are working as accountants, and six are working as teachers and librarians in the people's school. Some have also participated in technical skills spare-time schools, agricultural technology spare-time schools, and maternal and child health stations.

These senior primary school graduates have first become the backbone of the cooperative in using new-style farm tools and improving farming techniques. For example, Qiao Liguang led the members in irrigating and fighting drought in 1952, saving the cooperative's crops and increasing the yield per mu by twice as much as outside the cooperative. Geng Sujuan and Li Yunfang, female students learning to drive tractors, followed the tractors all day long, practicing tirelessly, and are now able to drive tractors. Agricultural technician Li Yunmang participated in agricultural production after graduating from senior primary school. While working, he studied agricultural techniques and learned cotton seed soaking, tested corn germination rates, and sweet potato hotbed seedling raising methods, improving the quality and yield of cotton, corn, sweet potatoes, and other crops in the cooperative. After learning well-drilling techniques, Li Mingxiang and five other senior primary school graduates organized more than forty young people to drill wells. They have now drilled twenty wells, which can irrigate a total of five hundred mu of land. Senior primary school graduates in other work positions in the cooperative have also exerted their strength and wisdom.

These senior primary school graduates have enlivened the cultural life of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative. The village opera troupe, composed of fifty-five young people, includes thirteen senior primary school students. Under their active organization and leadership, they have performed Ping opera such as "Women Representatives." The cooperative has eleven production teams, each with a newspaper reading group. Most of those who lead the newspaper reading are senior primary school students, who read the newspaper to their team members once every five days. Several senior primary school graduates who work as teachers in the people's school are very serious and responsible in their teaching, especially the principal, Yang Tong, who has never been late or left early in the past two years. Due to their enthusiasm for teaching, the number of students in the people's school has increased from fifty-two to ninety-three in the past year. Many students are now able to read the first volume of the senior primary school Chinese textbook.

    耿长锁农业生产合作社中的高小毕业生
    成为改进农业技术和开展文化活动的骨干
    据新华社保定八日电：河北省饶阳县五公村耿长锁领导的农业生产合作社里的三十四个高小毕业生，已成为改进农业技术和开展文化活动的骨干。他们中间有一人被选为合作社的副社长，两人当了生产队长，五人学开拖拉机，九人学打新式井，两人当了农业技术员，两人当了会计，六人当了民校教员和图书管理员。有的还分别参加机能技术业余学校、农业技术业余学校和妇幼保健站学习。
    这批高小毕业生，首先成了社里使用新式农具、改进耕作技术等方面的骨干。例如乔利广，一九五二年领导社员浇水抗旱，挽救了社里的庄稼，使每亩土地的产量比社外提高了两倍。学开拖拉机的女生耿素娟、李云芳，整天跟着拖拉机转，不怕劳累地练习，现在已能驾驶拖拉机了。农业技术员李运忙，高小毕业后就参加了农业生产，他一边工作，一边学习农业技术，已学会了棉花浸种，试验玉米发芽率和甘薯温床育苗法，使社里的棉花、玉米、甘薯等农作物的质量和产量都有所提高。李明响等五个高小毕业生学会打井技术后，便组织四十多个青年打井，现在已经打好了二十眼井，一共可浇五百亩地。在合作社里其他工作岗位上的高小毕业生，也都发挥了各人的力量和智慧。
    这批高小毕业生使耿长锁农业生产合作社的文化生活活跃起来了。由五十五个青年组成的村剧团，里面有十三个高小学生，在他们积极组织和领导下，排演了“妇女代表”等评剧。社里有十一个生产队，每队都有一个读报组，领导读报的大多是高小学生，他们每五天向本队队员读一次报。在民校当教员的几个高小毕业生，教学都很认真负责，特别是校长杨同，两年来从不迟到早退。由于他们热心教学，一年来民校学员由五十二人发展到九十三人。许多学员现在都能读高小第一册的语文课本了。
