    Commentary on the Washington Five-Nation Military Conference
  　Cui Qi
    The Five-Nation Military Conference, orchestrated by the United States, has already been held in Washington. The participants in the conference were the chiefs of staff and other high-ranking generals from the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand. The fact that the conference was kept secret indicates that it was not an ordinary meeting. According to official sources in the United States and other countries, these generals were to "study" the military situation in the Far East, particularly Indochina.

    Britain and some other countries have stated that their participation in the Five-Nation Military Conference will not entail any obligations and that this conference is unrelated to the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. The U.S. State Department also issued a statement to this effect, but the hypocrisy of this statement is obvious. American and British news agencies have already revealed that the U.S. planned this conference in connection with its plan to assemble a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and interfere in the Indochina war. An Associated Press dispatch on May 27 stated that "the basis for any action that the chiefs of staff may agree to recommend to their governments will be found in the plans of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Military leaders will undoubtedly study the prospects for such an alliance."

    Clearly, this is a step taken by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to achieve his consistent pursuit. Before and during the Geneva Conference, Dulles's entire diplomatic activity was openly aimed at "united action" and assembling a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, attempting to tie his allies together to engage in new military adventures in Asia. Although Dulles's adventurous activities, hostile to the Asian people, have been continuously frustrated, he still makes every effort to take all possible steps to continue. It is no accident that the State Department and the Pentagon have such high expectations for the Five-Nation Military Conference.

    Recently, diplomatic personnel and military leaders in Washington have been engaging in a series of frequent conspiratorial activities surrounding the convening of the Five-Nation Military Conference. The U.S. State Department's statement on May 28 acknowledged that the Five-Nation Military Conference "will supplement (U.S.) talks conducted concurrently with other countries." The communiqué of the first day of the conference on June 3 also stated that after this conference, the United States and "other countries" in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region "may hold further meetings on a broader basis." The facts people see are exactly like this. The likes of Wilson, Van Fleet, and Murphy have held talks with the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in Taiwan, aimed at establishing and expanding various military alliances. At the same time, under pressure from the United States, the French government has signed a "independence and cooperation" treaty with the Bao Dai puppet regime in Vietnam, making it easier for the United States to drag Bao Dai Vietnam into a military bloc led by the United States. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Donovan is also stepping up the establishment of a military alliance between Thailand and the puppet regimes of Cambodia and Laos, and U.S. military negotiations with Cambodia are taking place simultaneously in Geneva and Phnom Penh. As long as people link all these activities together, they will clearly see Dulles's blueprint for squeezing out old colonial countries and assembling a Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

    Therefore, even the U.S. International News Service admitted that the Five-Nation Military Conference "is a major step toward the establishment of a Southeast Asia defense alliance." Any attempt to conceal the relationship between the Five-Nation Military Conference and the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is futile.

    If the past few Five-Nation Chiefs of Staff meetings were always inseparable from the U.S. plan to intervene in the Indochina war, then in this Five-Nation Military Conference, the U.S. attempt to promote its plan to intervene in the Indochina war is even more arrogant and blatant. Admiral Carney, who represented the United States at the military conference, issued completely irrational warmongering calls on the eve of the conference, repeating Dulles's platitudes, shouting that the "free world" cannot "lose" Indochina; he compared the current situation in Indochina with the time when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, saying that the United States and its allies are facing a "crossroads" of "fighting to the end" and that it is "necessary" to conduct "stronger fighting" along the old path of aggression against Korea. U.S. Senators Nolan, Wiley, Bridges, Mansfield, and others echoed this clamor, trying their best to "launch an administrative campaign to 'educate the American people' to prepare for U.S. intervention in Indochina."

    All the conspiratorial activities of the U.S. ruling clique prove that it has also assigned the Washington Five-Nation Military Conference the task of obstructing the Geneva Conference from restoring peace in Indochina. The U.S. propaganda machine attempts to cover up this ulterior motive of the United States, but the facts are self-defeating. They say that Washington needs this military conference to "consider" issues of "joint action and possible intervention" because of the "anticipated" "failure" of the Geneva Conference; but at the same time, they also say that "regardless of whether the Geneva Conference can reach an agreement on the Indochina issue," the United States also hopes that this military conference will "discuss" the issue of military intervention. This clearly shows where the planners of the Washington Conference are trying to lead the conference. Since the Five-Nation Military Conference is preparing to take military intervention actions regardless of the outcome of the Geneva Conference, then the United States is in fact telling some of its allies that any efforts to seek a ceasefire in Indochina at the Geneva Conference will become superfluous.

    This is consistent with the task that the U.S. delegation has carried out at the Geneva Conference from beginning to end. Dulles and Smith have not put forward any proposals at the Geneva Conference; they have only tried their best to obstruct any possible agreement, attempting to use this to prove that consultation is useless and that there is only one way to go: military adventure. Now, the U.S. delegation blatantly intends to interrupt the discussion of the Korean issue and shows extreme impatience with the discussion of the Indochina issue. The U.S. propaganda machine is spreading pessimism, clamoring that all Western countries should follow the United States to undermine the Geneva Conference and engage in military adventures. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on June 2, U.S. officials openly stated that "the U.S. delegation in Geneva is almost ready to abandon its efforts to seek a solution (!)," "At the same time, the United States is preparing its strategy for Indochina on two other fronts," which refers to the conspiracy to use the United Nations to intervene, which has already begun with the "appeal from Thailand," and the Five-Nation Military Conference that is currently being held.

    Therefore, it is very clear that the purpose of the United States in planning this Washington conference and holding other military and political talks on a broader basis is to try to obtain some military and political decisions to bind the countries participating in the conference and drag them step by step into new adventures.

    Some countries have not failed to see this serious consequence and hope to follow a path that can enable them to avoid this consequence; however, there are still some who believe that something can be gained from the U.S.'s bankrupt "policy of strength" to exert pressure on the awakened Asian people. It is this unrealistic superstition that is being used by Washington adventurers to plot "united action" conspiracies. In fact, anyone can see that the U.S.'s "policy of strength" is already fundamentally ineffective for the Asian people, and it will prove to be of little use in the future.

    The communiqué of the first day of the Five-Nation Military Conference stated that this conference is not only "valuable" to the participants, but also "valuable" to Asian countries. The U.S. ruling clique wants to use this kind of rhetoric to win over some Asian countries and try to deceive the Asian people. However, the Five-Nation Military Conference planned by the United States only further exposes to the Asian people the far-reaching goals of the U.S. ruling clique to suppress the national liberation movements of Asian countries and promote U.S. neo-colonialism.

    评华盛顿五国军事会议
  　崔奇
    美国一手策划的五国军事会议，已在华盛顿召开了。会议的参加者有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰五国的参谋长及其他高级将领。会议保持秘密这一点，就表明这不是普通性质的会议。根据美国和其他国家的官方消息，这些国家的将军们要“研究”远东特别是印度支那的军事局势。
    英国和其他一些国家曾表示，它们参加五国军事会议将不承担任何义务，并且这个会议与东南亚侵略集团无关。美国国务院也对此发表了一个声明，但这个声明的虚伪性是一目了然的。美英通讯社早已透露，美国策划这次会议是和它力图拼凑东南亚侵略集团、干涉印度支那战争的计划联系在一起的。美联社五月二十七日电称，“各国参谋长可能同意向他们的政府建议的任何行动的基础，将在东南亚公约组织的计划中找到。军事领袖们无疑将研究这样一个联盟的前景”。
    很显然，这是美国国务卿杜勒斯为达到其一贯追求的目标所采取的一个步骤。在日内瓦会议召开的前后，杜勒斯的全部外交活动，都是公开地在搞“联合行动”和拼凑东南亚侵略集团，企图把他的盟国捆在一起，在亚洲从事新的军事冒险。虽然杜勒斯这些敌视亚洲人民的冒险活动，不断遭到了挫折，但他依然千方百计地采取一切可能的步骤来继续进行。国务院和五角大楼对五国军事会议寄予那样大的期望，不是偶然的。
    最近华盛顿的外交人员和军事首脑们，围绕着五国军事会议的召开，进行着一系列的频繁的阴谋活动。五月二十八日美国国务院的声明中承认：五国军事会议“将补充（美国）跟其他国家同时进行的会谈”。六月三日会议第一天的公报也说：这次会议以后，美国和东南亚及西太平洋地区的“其他国家”，“可能在更广泛的基础上举行进一步的会议”。人们看到的事实，也正是这样。威尔逊、范佛里特、墨菲之流，就曾和菲律宾、泰国、南朝鲜以及台湾蒋介石残余匪帮进行了旨在建立和扩大各种各样军事联盟的会谈。同时，在美国的压力下，法国政府已和越南保大傀儡政权签订了“独立与合作”条约，使得美国更便于把保大越南拖进以美国为盟主的军事集团中。美国驻泰国大使杜诺万也在加紧建立泰国和高棉、寮国傀儡政权之间的军事联盟，美国和高棉的军事谈判正在日内瓦和金边城同时进行。人们只要把所有这些活动联在一起，就会很清楚地看到杜勒斯排挤旧殖民国家，拼凑东南亚侵略集团的一张蓝图。
    因此，连美国国际新闻社也承认：五国军事会议“是向成立东南亚防御联盟方面迈进了一大步”。任何要想掩饰五国军事会议和东南亚侵略集团之间关系的企图，都是徒然的。
    如果说过去几次五国参谋会议总是和美国干涉印度支那战争的计划分不开，那末在这一次五国军事会议上，美国企图推行其干涉印度支那战争计划的野心，就更加狂妄和露骨了。代表美国参加军事会议的卡涅海军上将在会议前夕，就发出了完全丧失理性的好战叫嚣，重复杜勒斯的滥调，大叫“自由世界”不能“丧失”印度支那；他并把现在印度支那的情势和一九五○年美国发动侵略朝鲜战争时相比，说美国及其盟国已面临“战斗到底”的“十字路口”，“有必要”沿着侵略朝鲜的老路进行“更坚强的战斗”。美国参议员诺兰、维利、布里奇斯、曼斯菲尔德之流，随声喧嚷，竭力“展开一项行政性运动，‘教育美国人民’为美国干涉印度支那作好准备”。
    美国统治集团的一切阴谋活动，证明了它还给华盛顿五国军事会议规定了一个阻挠日内瓦会议恢复印度支那和平的任务。美国宣传机器企图把美国这个不可告人的图谋掩盖起来，但是，事实却是欲盖弥彰。他们说华盛顿所以需要这次军事会议“考虑”“联合行动方面以及可能的干涉方面”的问题，是因为它“预料得到的”日内瓦会议的“失败”；但同时，他们又说“不管日内瓦会议是否能就印度支那问题取得协议”，美国也希望这次军事会议“讨论”军事干涉的问题。这就很清楚地说明，华盛顿会议的策划者是在企图把会议导向何方。既然不管日内瓦会议的结果怎样，五国军事会议都要准备采取军事干涉行动，那末，美国事实上就是告诉它的一些盟国，任何在日内瓦会议上谋求印度支那停战的努力，都要变成多余的了。
    这是和美国代表团在日内瓦会议上自始至终执行的任务相吻合的。杜勒斯和史密斯都没有在日内瓦会议上提出任何一个建议，他们只是竭力阻挠任何可能的协议，企图借此证明协商没有用处，只有走军事冒险一途。现在，美国代表团露骨地打算中断朝鲜问题的讨论，并对印度支那问题的讨论表示极不耐烦。美国宣传机器正在散布悲观空气，叫嚷所有西方国家都应该追随美国来破坏日内瓦会议，进行军事冒险。据六月二日合众社华盛顿电，美国官方公开表示，“美国在日内瓦的代表团差不多已准备放弃求得一项解决办法的努力（！）”，“同时，美国正在另外两条战线上准备它对印度支那的战略”，这就是指的已由“泰国的呼吁”开始的利用联合国进行干涉的阴谋，和正在举行的这个五国军事会议。
    因此，很显然，美国策划这次华盛顿会议，并要在更广泛的基础上举行其他军事和政治会谈，其目的是企图取得一些军事和政治的决定，用以束缚参加会议的国家，把它们一步一步地拖到新的冒险中去。
    有些国家并不是没有看到这个严重的后果，并希望遵循可以使自己避免这个后果的途径；但是，依然还有人迷信从美国破了产的“实力政策”中能够得到一些什么，来向觉醒了的亚洲人民施行压力。正是这个不现实的迷信，被华盛顿冒险家利用来策划“联合行动”的阴谋。事实上，任何人都可以看到，美国的“实力政策”对亚洲人民已经是根本行不通的，今后也将会证明不会有什么用处。
    五国军事会议第一天的公报说，这个会议不仅对参加者有“价值”，而且对亚洲国家也有“价值”。美国统治集团想用这种花言巧语来笼络一些亚洲国家，并企图愚弄亚洲人民。但是美国所策划的五国军事会议，只是在亚洲人民面前进一步暴露了美国统治集团力图镇压亚洲各国的民族解放运动，推行美国新殖民主义的深远目的。
