    People's Courts Across the Country
    Have Established Seventy Production Enterprise Comrades' Trial Conferences
    By the end of May, people's courts across the country had established seventy production enterprise comrades' trial conferences in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. Based on the nature of the comrades' trial conferences as mass organizations for self-education of workers, the chairmen and members of these comrades' trial conferences were all elected by the general assembly or representative assembly of workers and staff of the industrial and mining enterprises. They are all workers who are firm in their stance, upright in their style, active in production, consistently abide by labor discipline, and are good at connecting with the masses.
    These industrial and mining enterprises' comrades' trial conferences all select typical events related to labor and production discipline with educational significance among the workers of their own units for trial. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's comrades' trial conference, in fifteen trials last year, tried a total of thirty-three workers who had committed minor acts of corruption and theft, and persistently violated labor discipline and operating procedures. The No. 1 Spinning Department of the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's comrades' trial conference's first trial was of three workers who did not implement working methods, falsely reported production results, and were habitually absent from work despite repeated education. The Yongli Chemical Industries Company Nanjing Plant's comrades' trial conference's first trial was of three theft cases. In the trial, the focus was on the trial, and the masses were mobilized to conduct criticism; after the meeting, attention was also paid to caring for and uniting the defendants. Many comrades' trial conferences also sent people to help the defendants formulate individual production plans. Therefore, many of those tried have undergone changes. Of the nineteen people tried by the thirteen comrades' trial conferences established by the Kailuan Coal Mine, eighteen have now changed. Of the thirty-three people tried by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's comrades' trial conference, twelve have shown significant changes and have had their administrative sanctions revoked. Liu Yin, a worker at the Kailuan Coal Mine, had a serious history of not complying with labor discipline, and had been absent from work for eighty-six days without reason in 1953 alone, and was also very lazy in his work; after the comrades' trial conference held a general meeting for his trial, he recognized his mistakes, and after the encouragement and help of trade union cadres and comrades' trial conference members, he has never been absent from work without reason since then, and takes the initiative to help others after finishing his work.
    Many factory and mine comrades' trial conferences have paid attention to mobilizing workers to participate in the trial meeting, and after the meeting, they also coordinated with the trade union to organize workers to discuss, thereby improving the political awareness and legal awareness of the broad masses of workers, and playing a great role in consolidating labor discipline and promoting production in various factories and mines. Accidents used to occur frequently in the Third Team of the Loading and Unloading Section of the Transportation Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, but after the comrades' trial conference was established and began to work, this situation gradually changed. Twelve accidents occurred in November last year, but only six accidents occurred in December, and the number of accidents decreased to two in January this year; at the same time, the attendance rate of the entire team also increased from about 80% to 98.8%. After the Wuchang No. 1 Yarn Factory's South Field Cone Winding Workshop trial-established a comrades' trial conference, the absenteeism rate of the entire workshop quickly dropped from 10% to 5%; at present, this workshop has basically eliminated the phenomenon of absenteeism, and the workers who were tried have all changed, and are producing and studying with peace of mind.

    全国各地人民法院
    已建立了七十个生产企业同志审判会
    五月底止，全国各地人民法院已在国营工矿企业中建立了七十个生产企业同志审判会。根据同志审判会是职工进行自我教育的群众性组织的这一性质，这些同志审判会的主席和委员都是经过工矿企业的全体职工大会或代表会选举出来的。他们都是立场坚定，作风正派，生产积极，一贯遵守劳动纪律，并善于联系群众的职工。
    这些工矿企业的同志审判会都挑选本单位职工间有关劳动、生产纪律的具有教育意义的典型事件进行审判。鞍山钢铁公司的同志审判会，在去年一年的十五次审判中，共审判了犯有轻微的贪污盗窃行为和一贯违反劳动纪律及操作规程等错误的职工三十三人。国营上海第二棉纺织厂一纺部的同志审判会第一次审判的对象是三个不执行工作法、虚报生产成绩和任意旷工而又屡教不改的工人。永利化学工业公司南京厂的同志审判会第一次审判中审判了三个偷窃案件。在审判会上，以审判为主，并发动群众进行批评；会后，并注意关怀和团结被审判人。许多同志审判会还派人帮助被审判人订个人生产计划。因此，许多被审判的人，都有了转变。开滦煤矿所建立的十三个同志审判会审判的十九个人中，现在已有十八人有了转变。鞍山钢铁公司的同志审判会审判的三十三个人中，有十二人有了显著转变，并已经行政方面撤销了处分。开滦煤矿工人刘印过去不遵守劳动纪律的情况很严重，曾在一九五三年的一年中无故旷工八十六天，工作上也很疲沓；经同志审判会召开大会审判后，他认识了自己的错误，会后又经过工会干部和同志审判会委员的鼓励和帮助，从此就再没有无故缺一次工，工作做完了还主动帮助别人。
    许多厂矿的同志审判会在审判时都注意动员职工参加审判大会，会后，还配合工会组织职工讨论，因而提高了广大职工的政治觉悟和守法观念，对各厂矿巩固劳动纪律和推动生产起了很大作用。鞍山钢铁公司运输部装卸科第三队过去经常发生事故，但在同志审判会成立并开始工作后，这种情况就逐渐改变，去年十一月发生了十二件事故，到十二月只发生六件事故，今年一月事故减少到二件；同时，全队的出勤率也由百分之八十左右上升到百分之九十八点八。武昌第一纱厂南场筒摇成车间试建了同志审判会后，全车间的缺勤率很快地由百分之十降到百分之五；目前，这个车间已基本上消灭了旷工现象，被审判的工人都有了转变，安心地生产和学习。（新华社）
