Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 31st: The Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party continued on the 29th and concluded on the 30th.

At the meeting on the 30th, the Congress passed the new Constitution of the Hungarian Working People's Party and elected the Party Central Committee composed of seventy-one members and nineteen alternate members. The Congress also elected the Inspection Committee composed of thirteen members. Rakosi delivered a closing speech, in which he summarized the work of the Party Congress.

At the morning session on the 29th, the delegates concluded the discussion of the second item on the agenda, unanimously approved the report by I. Nagy on the tasks of state organs and local People's Councils, and adopted the tasks proposed in the report as guiding principles for their work. The Congress heard and approved the summary report on the work of the Central Inspection Committee made by K. Kish on the third item on the agenda.

The Congress also heard the report by R. Acs, member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, on the revision of the Constitution of the Hungarian Working People's Party. Acs pointed out that the great changes that have taken place in the lives of the Hungarian people and the life of the Party, as well as in the Party's work style, make it necessary for the Party to make important revisions to the Constitution of the Hungarian Working People's Party. The draft amendment to the Party Constitution proposes the following new provisions regarding the nature of the Party: "The Hungarian Working People's Party is the party of the working class and the working people. It unites the most progressive forces of the Hungarian people in its ranks, the outstanding representatives of the working class, working peasants, and intellectuals. The Party is a voluntary fighting alliance; it takes the doctrines of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin as its guiding principle in its activities." Acs pointed out that the issue of Party unity occupies a position of paramount importance in the Party Constitution. The unity of the Party is the foundation of all victories of the working class and the working people, and also the condition for the victorious building of socialism. Acs also talked about the importance of collective leadership, strengthening intra-Party democracy, and Party discipline. He concluded by saying that the new Party Constitution is based on Lenin's theory of the Party. The implementation of the revised Party Constitution will further consolidate the unity of the Hungarian Working People's Party, help to further strengthen Party discipline, and expand the Party's ties with the working class and all working people.

The afternoon session on the 29th discussed Acs's report.

At the meeting on the 29th, representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Iran, Denmark, Greece, Australia and many other countries delivered congratulatory messages to the Congress.

    大会通过新党章并选出党的中央委员会
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党第三次代表大会在二十九日继续开会，在三十日闭幕。
    在三十日的会议上，代表大会通过了匈牙利劳动人民党的新党章，并选出了由七十一个委员和十九个候补委员组成的党中央委员会。大会还选出了十三个委员组成的检查委员会。拉科西致闭幕词，他对这次党代表大会的工作作了总结性的发言。
    在二十九日上午会议上，代表们结束了第二项议程的讨论，一致通过了伊·纳吉所作的关于国家机关和地方人民会议的任务的报告，并把报告中所提出的任务作为工作的指导方针。大会听取并通过了卡·基什就第三项议程所作的中央检查委员会工作总结报告。
    大会还听取了党中央委员会政治局委员拉·阿契所作的关于修改匈牙利劳动人民党党章的报告。阿契指出：在匈牙利人民生活和党的生活中以及在党的工作方式中所发生的巨大变化，使党必须对匈牙利劳动人民党党章作重要的修改。修改党章草案建议对党的性质作如下的新规定：“匈牙利劳动人民党是工人阶级、劳动人民的政党。它在自己的队伍中团结着匈牙利人民的最进步的力量，工人阶级、劳动农民、知识分子的优秀代表。党是一个自愿的战斗联盟；它在它的活动中以马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的学说为指针。”阿契指出，党的团结问题在党章上占有头等重要的地位。党的团结一致是工人阶级和劳动人民一切胜利的基础，也是胜利地建成社会主义的条件。阿契还谈到了集体领导、加强党内民主和党的纪律的重要性。他最后说，新的党章是以列宁关于党的学说为基础的。实行经过修改后的党章，就将更加巩固匈牙利劳动人民党的团结，有助于进一步加强党的纪律，扩大党和工人阶级、和全体劳动人民的联系。
    二十九日下午会议讨论了阿契的报告。
