Hubei Province's work on focusing on the rectification of handicraft production cooperatives has come to a stage and is now summarizing experience for promotion. It is estimated that the rectification of handicraft production cooperatives throughout the province can be completed by the end of June.

The Hubei Provincial Handicraft Work Conference, held in late February, decided to rectify the existing handicraft production cooperatives based on the situation that some cooperative members had low awareness, and the management and financial accounting systems were chaotic. After the meeting, each special district selected twelve handicraft production cooperatives as the focus of rectification. In the rectification, all localities generally first carried out ideological mobilization and explained policies to raise the socialist consciousness of cooperative members, and then promoted democracy, inspected work, established systems, and solved existing problems. Some also developed Party and League organizations.

The handicraft production cooperatives that have been rectified have significantly improved in all aspects. For example, the Shashi Weaving Production Cooperative originally had a defective product rate of 34% because members were unwilling to disclose their techniques. After the rectification, in April, not only was the defective rate reduced to 6%, but the production plan was also overfulfilled. The Echeng County Plow Production Cooperative used to sell 80% of its products to private merchants on credit, with a credit period of up to four or five months, and the financial system was very chaotic, resulting in huge losses and very little income for the members. Most members demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. After the rectification, sales contracts worth 90 million yuan were signed with the county's six supply and marketing cooperatives, the funding problem was solved, the members' enthusiasm for production was increased, the output increased by 72%, the quality increased by 62%, and the cost decreased by 16.6%. The entire cooperative was rejuvenated.

During this period, the leading organs, commercial departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties also strengthened their leadership and support for handicraft production cooperatives. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the sixth and seventh districts of Yingcheng County signed combined contracts with handicraft production cooperatives totaling more than 320 million yuan. Yingshan County held a handicraft product exhibition and a material exchange meeting. The handicraft sections of the people's governments of various counties have been established one after another. Huangshi City, Echeng County, and Xishui County are actively preparing to establish joint organizations of handicraft production cooperatives. Ten counties and cities, including Echeng, Yichang, and Shashi, have also piloted the establishment of handicraft laborers associations.

While focusing on the rectification of handicraft production cooperatives, various localities have appropriately developed a number of handicraft cooperative organizations according to the requirements of handicraftsmen. In the first quarter, a total of thirty-nine handicraft production cooperatives and five hundred and thirty-seven handicraft production teams were newly established throughout the province.

    湖北省重点整顿手工业生产合作社有成效
    湖北省重点整顿手工业生产合作社的工作已告一段落，现正总结经验加以推广。预计全省整顿手工业生产合作社的工作，六月底可以完成。
    二月下旬召开的湖北省手工业工作会议，曾根据有些手工业生产合作社社员觉悟不高、经营管理和财务会计制度混乱等情况，决定对原有的手工业生产合作社加以整顿。会后，各专区共选择了十二个手工业生产合作社作为进行整顿的重点。在整顿中，各地一般都首先进行思想动员、交代政策，以提高社员的社会主义觉悟，然后发扬民主，检查工作，建立制度，解决存在的问题，有的还发展了党、团组织。
    经过整顿的手工业生产合作社，在各方面都有显著提高。如沙市织布生产合作社原来因为社员们不愿公开技术，产品中次品占百分之三十四；经过整顿以后，在四月份不但使次品率降低到百分之六，还超额完成了生产计划。鄂城县犁头生产合作社过去常将百分之八十的产品赊销给私商，赊期长达四、五个月，财务制度非常混乱；以致大量赔钱，社员收入很少，大部社员要求退社；经过整顿，和全县六个供销合作社订立了九千万元的销货合同，资金问题得到解决，社员生产积极性提高，产量提高了百分之七十二，质量提高了百分之六十二，成本降低了百分之十六点六，全社气象一新。
    在这个期间，各县领导机关、商业部门和供销合作社也加强了对手工业生产合作社的领导和扶植。应城县第六、七两区的供销合作社，即和手工业生产合作社订立了总值三亿二千多万元的结合合同。应山县举办了手工业品展览会和物资交流会。各县人民政府手工业科已相继建立。黄石市、鄂城县、浠水县正积极筹备成立手工业生产合作社联合社的机构，鄂城、宜昌、沙市等十个县、市还试办了手工业劳动者协会。
    在重点整顿手工业生产合作社的同时，各地根据手工业者的要求，适当发展了一批手工业合作组织。在第一季度，全省各地共新建了三十九个手工业生产合作社和五百三十七个手工业生产小组。
