Taiyuan City's Grassroots Industrial and Mining Cooperatives Actively Strengthen the Supply of Non-Staple Foods

Taiyuan City's grassroots industrial and mining cooperatives are actively strengthening the supply of non-staple foods to meet the needs of workers and staff. Currently, the supply of non-staple foods by various grassroots cooperatives accounts for 17.84 percent of total sales, nearly double the amount of last year. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Cooperative has set up many non-staple food stalls next to the workers' dormitories, increasing the variety of goods to more than eighty types. At the same time, it has entrusted processing and placed orders with handicraft workshops producing tofu, noodles, vinegar, and pastries. The Xishan Coal Mine Cooperative has also established its own non-staple food processing department. Grassroots industrial and mining cooperatives also actively purchase non-staple foods from other places. For example, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Cooperative has established contact with the Jinci Fish Farm, ensuring the timely supply of fresh fish. (Shi Lingui)

    太原市各工矿基层合作社
    积极加强副食品供应工作
    太原市各工矿基层合作社积极加强副食品供应工作，以满足职工对副食品的需要。目前，各基层合作社副食品的供应量已占销货总额的百分之十七点八四，比去年增加近一倍。太原钢铁厂合作社在职工宿舍旁边设立了许多副食品摊子，经营品种增加到八十多种，同时先后向豆腐、挂面、醋房、点心等手工业作坊进行了委托加工和订货。西山煤矿合作社还自己设立了副食品加工部。各工矿基层合作社也从外地积极采购副食品。如太原重型机器厂合作社即和晋祠鱼场建立了联系，保证了鲜鱼的及时供应。（史林贵）
