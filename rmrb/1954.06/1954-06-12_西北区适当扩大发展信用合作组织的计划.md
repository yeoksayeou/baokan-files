    Northwest Branch of the People's Bank of China, based on the spirit of the National First Rural Credit Cooperative Conference, and in conjunction with the development of credit cooperative organizations in the Northwest region in recent months and the possible conditions, has appropriately expanded the plan for developing credit cooperative organizations in the entire region in 1954.
    According to the new plan, the Northwest region will develop 1,513 credit cooperatives (the original plan was 738) and 2,994 credit mutual aid teams in 1954. Among them, the planned new credit cooperatives are equal to 395 percent of the total number of credit cooperatives developed in the region over the years, and the credit mutual aid teams are equal to 37 percent of the total number of credit mutual aid teams developed in the region over the years.
    According to this plan, the region will develop more than 599,700 members of credit cooperatives and more than 119,700 members of credit mutual aid teams this year. Together with the original members, the total number of members in the region will reach one million; the number of households participating in credit cooperative organizations will account for about 16 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the region.
    In order to ensure the smooth completion of these tasks, the region will train 7,160 cadres for running credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid teams in batches this year, including 3,100 bank cadres and 4,060 cadres from credit cooperative organizations. In addition, the People's Banks in various parts of the Northwest region will also build 486 new rural business offices and 100 bank mobile teams in the region to strengthen assistance and guidance to credit cooperative organizations.

    西北区适当扩大发展信用合作组织的计划
    中国人民银行西北区行根据全国第一次农村信用合作座谈会议的精神，结合西北地区最近几个月来信用合作组织的发展情况和可能条件，适当地扩大了一九五四年全区发展信用合作组织的计划。
    依照新的计划，西北全区在一九五四年内，将发展信用合作社一千五百一十三个（原计划为七百三十八个），信用互助组二千九百九十四个。其中计划新建的信用合作社，等于全区历年来信用合作社发展总数的百分之三百九十五，信用互助组等于历年来全区发展总数的百分之三十七。
    按照这一计划，今年全区将发展信用合作社社员五十九万九千七百多人，信用互助组组员十一万九千七百多人。连同原有的社员、组员，全区社员、组员将达到一百万人；参加信用合作组织的户数，将占全区农业总户数的百分之十六左右。
    为了保证这些任务的顺利完成，今年全区将分批训练办信用合作社和信用互助组的干部七千一百六十人，其中银行干部三千一百人，信用合作组织的干部四千零六十人。此外，西北区各地人民银行还将在全区新建四百八十六个农村营业所和一百个银行流动组，以便加强对信用合作组织的帮助和指导。
