Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 19th: TASS Moscow, June 18th: "Pravda" published an article by L. Okulov entitled "The Farce Staged by the United States in Jinhae," commenting on the "conference" held in Jinhae, South Korea, starting June 15th, with the aim of establishing a "Joint Anti-Communist Front of Asian Nations."

The article stated: This conspiracy of the insane reactionaries headed by Syngman Rhee has the support of certain American groups interested in maintaining international tension; were it not for this, the conspiracy would not be worthy of attention at all. Even the choice of the address of this "Anti-Communist Conference" proves this point. The conference was held at a US naval base in Jinhae Port.

The list of countries and places sending representatives to the conference also proves this point. For example, the list includes Taiwan—a Chinese island illegally occupied by U.S. armed forces; the puppet state of Bao Dai; Thailand and the Philippines, which follow U.S. policy; and the Ryukyu Islands, occupied by the United States. The initiators of this conference are the Syngman Rhee elements, "representatives" of South Korea who are currently suffering under the iron heel of the United States. Therefore, there is not even one independent country on this list.

Finally, the selected time for holding the conference and the process of convening it are also very special. As everyone knows, the Syngman Rhee elements, on the orders of their American masters, made many attempts last autumn, winter, and this spring to put together an Asian "Anti-Communist Group." But all their attempts ended in failure. Those who were running around to piece together this group originally dreamed of dragging countries like Indonesia, Burma, and India into this group, but now they have had to abandon this plan. The busy political salesmen had to limit their activities to visiting countries that are completely dependent on the imperialist powers. But even in these countries, they could not get them to agree to hold a conference with official representatives. Therefore, it was decided to hold a conference attended by so-called "opinion representatives" during the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. But even this plan failed, because public opposition frightened some of the aforementioned "representatives," and they dared not go to South Korea at that time. Despite Syngman Rhee's anger, the conference had to be postponed.

While the American ruling groups are doing their best to hinder further discussion of the Korean question in Geneva, they are rushing to convene the infamous "Anti-Communist Conference" in Jinhae.

It is no coincidence that the Jinhae Conference opened on the day that representatives of the United States and other Western countries interrupted negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in Geneva.

Those reactionary groups in the United States are trying hard to show that their anti-communist hysteria and policy of maintaining international tension in Asia and around the world are supported by the people of Asian countries. But it is impossible to deceive the people. A handful of traitors who serve the oppressors of their motherland cannot masquerade as representatives of the people of Asian countries. Any such attempt is doomed to failure.

    美国在镇海导演的丑剧
    ——“真理报”刊载的文章的摘要
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载了鲁·奥库洛夫的一篇文章，题为“美国在镇海导演的丑剧”，评论从六月十五日开始在南朝鲜镇海举行的以建立“亚洲反共国家联合阵线”为目的的“会议”。
    文章说：以李承晚为首的疯狂的反动派的这个阴谋有对保持国际紧张局势感兴趣的某些美国集团的支持，要不是因为这一点，这个阴谋本来是根本不值得注意的。甚至这个“反共会议”的地址的选择也证明了这一点。这个会议是在美国的一个海军基地镇海港举行的。
    派代表参加这个会议的国家和地方的名单，也可以证明这一点。例如，名单上有台湾——一个被美国武装部队非法占领的中国岛屿；保大傀儡国；追随美国政策的泰国、菲律宾；为美国占领的琉球群岛。发起这个会议的是目前正在美国铁蹄下受苦受难的南朝鲜的“代表”李承晚分子。因此，这个名单上连一个独立的国家都没有。
    最后，选定的举行会议的时间以及召开这个会议的经过也是很特别的。大家知道，李承晚分子奉他们的美国主子的命令在去年秋天、冬天和今年春天曾作了许多次拼凑亚洲“反共集团”的尝试。但是他们的一切尝试结果都失败了。为拼凑这个集团而奔走的人们本来梦想把像印度尼西亚、缅甸和印度这样的国家都拖入这个集团的，而现在不得不放弃这种打算了。到处奔忙的政治推销员们只得把他们的活动限于访问完全依附于帝国主义大国的国家。但是甚至在这些国家，他们都不可能使它们同意举行一个派正式代表参加的会议。因此就决定在日内瓦外长会议开会期间举行一个由所谓“舆论代表”参加的会议。但是，甚至连这个计划都失败了，因为人民公开的反对意见使有些上面所说的“代表”害怕了，他们不敢在那时候到南朝鲜去。尽管李承晚恼怒万分，会议不得不延期举行。
    美国统治集团一方面竭力阻挠在日内瓦进一步讨论朝鲜问题，一方面赶紧在镇海召开恶名昭著的“反共会议”。
    镇海会议是美国和其他西方国家代表们在日内瓦中断关于和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判的这一天开幕的，这不是偶然的事情。
    美国的那些反动集团竭力想表示，他们的反共歇斯底里和在亚洲及全世界保持国际紧张局势的政策是得到亚洲各国人民的支持的。但是，要欺骗人民是办不到的。一小撮为他们祖国的压迫者服务的卖国贼是不能冒充亚洲各国人民的代表的。任何这种企图是注定要失败的。
