Tanggu New Port is the first port rebuilt and expanded by the Chinese people before the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan. It is located southeast of Tianjin, only more than 160 kilometers away from the capital. Therefore, it is known as the "Gateway to the Capital" or the "Motherland's Gateway." Since the completion of the first phase of the project in October 1952, Tanggu New Port has become an important stop for the exchange of goods between the north and south of China and for foreign trade. The water area of this port is very large, and no artificial port in the world can compare with it. Four large ships of 10,000 tons can be berthed simultaneously at Pier No. 1. Pier No. 2 is equipped with automatic coal loading equipment. The transportation here is very convenient. The railway is connected to seven major railway trunk lines in the country, and the highway can reach all parts of the country. Passing through the Xingang Sluice Gate and going west along the Haihe River, it can also connect with the five inland rivers of Hebei Province. There is also a corresponding ship repair and shipbuilding factory here, which can repair domestic and foreign ships at any time. Recently, many mechanical loading and unloading tools have been added to the wharf. The workers have also promoted the advanced loading and unloading methods of Soviet ports, making loading and unloading efficiency reach unprecedented heights. The construction of Tanggu New Port is still in progress, and in the future, it will be connected with Tianjin to form a modern city.

Tanggu New Port is a huge commercial port built by the Chinese people themselves. Four 10,000-ton freighters can be berthed simultaneously at Pier No. 1. This is the situation of foreign ships berthing at Pier No. 1.

Pilotage is an integral part of national sovereignty. Before liberation, foreign ships were guided by foreign pilots, but now this task is entirely undertaken by our own pilots. This is a picture of Shi Xueliang, a model worker of Tianjin and a pilot of Tanggu New Port, guiding foreign ships out of the port. (Photo by Ding Yi)

This is the Xingang Sluice Gate. Ships from Tianjin pass through here to enter the sea; ships from overseas can also reach China's inland rivers through here. Various equipment needed for the construction of the motherland is shipped from abroad, and the steam crane is unloading large boilers. In order to make the loading and unloading work orderly, the workers promoted various advanced Soviet loading and unloading experiences. This is the scene of a "pre-ship meeting" being held to arrange unloading work.

China's export goods are loaded onto cargo ships here.

The small locomotives for mining, transported from fraternal countries, are also unloaded here.

These are the automatic coal loaders on Pier No. 2 and the suction-type dredger working to maintain the depth of the port area.

The photos in this issue of the pictorial, except where noted, are taken by Guan Shaoxi.

The construction of the new port is still in progress. The "Taishan No. 5" crane ship is repairing the breakwater.

    塘沽新港——祖国的大门
    塘沽新港是我国人民在实行第一个五年计划前改建和扩建而成的第一个港口。它在天津市的东南，离首都只有一百六十多公里。因此它有“首都的门户”或“祖国的大门”之称。自从一九五二年十月完成第一期工程后，塘沽新港已经成了我国南北物资交流和对外贸易的重要停脚点。这个港口的水区面积很大，世界上还没有人工港可以跟它相比。一号码头上可以同时停泊四艘载重万吨的巨大轮船。二号码头上有自动装煤机的设备。这里的交通非常方便。铁路可以跟全国七条主要铁路干线相通，公路可以通达全国各地，过新港船闸，溯海河西行，又可以同河北省的五条内河沟通。这里还有一个相应的船舶修造厂，随时修理国内外来船。最近以来，码头上增添了许多机械装卸工具。职工们还推广了苏联港口的先进装卸法，使装卸效率达到前所未有的高度。塘沽新港的建设工作还在继续进行，今后它将和天津联接成一个近代化城市。
    塘沽新港是我国人民自己修建的一座巨大的商港。它的一号码头上可以同时停泊四艘万吨巨轮。这是国外来船在一号码头停泊靠岸的情形。
    引水权是国家主权的一个组成部分。解放前国外来船都由外国引水员导引，现在完全是由我国的引水员来担任这一工作了。这是天津市劳动模范、塘沽新港引水员施学良导引国外船只出港的情形。　丁一摄
    这是新港船闸。从天津来的船只通过这里入海；从海外来的船只也可经此到达我国的内河。从国外运到为祖国建设所需要的各种器材，汽力起重机正在卸大型锅炉。为了使装卸工作有条不紊，职工们推广了苏联的各种先进装卸经验。这是正在召开“船前会议”布置卸货工作的情形。
    我国出口物资在这里装上货船。
    从兄弟国家运来的采矿用的小火车头，也在这里卸货了。
    这是二号码头上的自动装煤机和为维护港区的水深而工作着的吸扬式挖泥船。
