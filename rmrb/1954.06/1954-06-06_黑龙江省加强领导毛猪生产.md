Heilongjiang Province is further strengthening its leadership in hog production, planning to raise 1.2 million fattened hogs this year (an increase of 270,000 over last year). Recently, various counties have successively held meetings or issued instructions to organize farmers to develop hog production.

Local supply and marketing departments are also actively supporting the pig farming industry. State-owned native produce companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in counties such as Taonan, Suihua, Longjiang, and Zhaozhou have signed production and sales contracts with farmers and are helping farmers solve problems related to feed and procurement. Many county cooperatives have also purchased large quantities of high-quality breeding pigs from other regions to meet rural needs. In order to effectively prevent hog cholera, the province has launched a mass epidemic prevention campaign, ensuring pig safety by strengthening pig feeding management and paying attention to environmental sanitation. This spring, 130,000 pigs in the province received hog cholera vaccinations, and 80 key villages for hog cholera prevention were cultivated. Each county has assigned dedicated personnel to lead hog production, and the animal husbandry departments are conducting in-depth investigations in key villages to summarize the masses' pig-raising experience. The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station of Longjiang County has summarized the pig-raising experience of Kaoshan Village and is preparing to promote it throughout the county.

    黑龙江省加强领导毛猪生产
    黑龙江省进一步加强对毛猪生产的领导，计划今年内喂出肥猪一百二十万口（比去年增产二十七万口）。最近各县都先后召开会议或发出指示，组织农民发展毛猪生产。
    各地供销部门也积极扶植养猪事业，洮南、绥化、龙江、肇州等县国营土产公司、供销社等都与农民订立了产销合同，并帮助农民解决饲料及收购问题。还有很多县联社从外地购入大批优良种猪，供应农村需要。该省为了有效地防治猪瘟，开展了群众性的防疫运动，从加强猪的饲养管理、注意环境卫生等方面保证猪的安全。今年春季全省有十三万口猪实行了猪瘟预防注射，同时又培养了八十个防治猪瘟的重点村。各县都有专人负责领导毛猪生产，畜牧部门并深入重点村总结群众养猪经验。龙江县畜牧兽医总站已总结了靠山村的养猪经验，准备在全县推广。
