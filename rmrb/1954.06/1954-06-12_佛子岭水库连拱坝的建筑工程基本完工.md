Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, June 11th: The dam piers and arches of the Foziling Reservoir arch dam were all poured to the top on the 6th. Thus, China's first reinforced concrete arch dam has been declared basically completed. The huge arch dam, like a city of steel, connects the mountain tops more than 100 meters above sea level on both banks of the Pi River. The turbulent flow of the Pi River is blocked within the valley, and flows slowly through the opened sluice gates.

From May onwards, the builders of the arch dam accelerated the progress of the project. In May, seven dam arches were poured to the top, of which two arches were completed eight hours ahead of schedule due to improved operation methods. As the completion date approached in June, the workers became particularly tense and excited. On the 6th, the steel workers of the 6th district team only used six hours to tie the steel bars, and the carpenters pulled the formwork in four and a half hours. Then the cement workers carried out two arches in parallel pouring, and poured the two dam arches to the top in one and a half shifts. When the last cubic meter of concrete was poured, the construction site was boiling with joyous shouts. The workers beat gongs and drums, set off firecrackers, and planted red flags on all the dam piers and arches. The carpenters and cement workers who came down from the high-altitude operating frames were embraced by everyone.

    佛子岭水库连拱坝的建筑工程基本完工
    【新华社蚌埠十一日电】佛子岭水库连拱坝的坝垛、坝拱已在六日全部浇筑到顶。到此，新中国第一座钢筋混凝土的连拱坝宣告基本完工。巨大的连拱坝像一座钢铁的城，把淠河两岸拔海一百多公尺高的山头连接起来，汹涌的淠河水流被拦阻在峡谷内，由开启的几套闸门中缓慢的流下去。
    五月份起，连拱坝的修筑者加速着工程的进展。五月份有七个坝拱浇筑到顶，其中有两个拱，由于改进操作法提前八小时筑成。到了六月，接近完工的日子，工人们格外紧张和兴奋。六日这一天，六区队的钢筋工人仅用六小时就扎好了钢筋，木工四个半小时拉好模壳板，接着水泥工人实行两拱并浇，在一班半的时间内，就把两个坝拱浇到顶端。在浇完最后一方混凝土时，工地上沸腾着狂欢的呼声，工人们敲起锣鼓、放起鞭炮，把所有的坝垛、坝拱上都插起红旗。从高空操作架子上走下来的木工、水泥工人，被大家拥抱起来。
