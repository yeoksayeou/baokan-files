The Central People's Government Ministry of Education Issues Instructions on Holding Primary School Teacher Training Courses, and stipulates the teaching plans (draft) for one-year and two-year primary school teacher training courses.

The instructions argue that to run primary school education well, it is necessary to improve the quality of existing teachers, especially those who have not reached the level of graduation from a junior normal school. Among the ways to improve teacher quality, holding primary school teacher training courses is one of the main methods. The instructions clearly stipulate that the main task of the primary school teacher training course is to provide teachers (including kindergarten educators) whose actual cultural level is above that of a higher primary school graduate but not sufficient for junior normal school graduation with a certain period of training, so that they can reach the level of junior normal school graduation in major subjects. The length of study in the primary school teacher training course is determined based on the actual cultural level of the students. Teachers with a higher primary school graduation or one year of junior normal school incomplete study level should study for two years, and teachers with more than one year of junior normal school incomplete study level should study for one year. Enrollment should adopt a combination of selection by administrative organs and school review and testing. In addition to paying attention to the students' physical health conditions during enrollment, those with better political qualities, active work, younger age, and no major family burdens should be absorbed for study first. If the school review and testing determine that the selected students do not meet or temporarily do not meet the learning conditions, the original selecting agency should still be responsible for their placement. Regarding how to implement the teaching plan in various regions, the instructions point out that the principle of focusing on key points and practicality should be grasped. It is necessary to improve the students' cultural and scientific knowledge level in a focused manner, and also combine it with the needs of primary school teaching work. Therefore, without affecting the required level of the teaching plan, appropriate adjustments can be made to the subject settings and teaching hours based on local conditions. Regarding the students' studies, treatment, and work after graduation, the instructions stipulate that the results of the training course students are divided into academic performance and conduct performance. If the academic performance, even after makeup exams, still has one failing grade in Chinese or mathematics, or two failing grades in subjects other than Chinese and mathematics, they shall not be promoted or graduated, but repetition is limited to once. If the conduct performance is failing, they should be ordered to withdraw from school. During the study period, students shall not request to transfer schools. Those who are allowed to graduate upon completion of the study period shall be reported by the school to the competent administrative agency for review and issuance of a primary school teacher training course graduation certificate, which has the same effect as a junior normal school graduation certificate. After graduation, work will be assigned by the original selecting agency. During the study period, in addition to receiving a people's scholarship according to the junior normal school student standard, students will also receive a subsidy, the standard of which will be determined by each province and city based on local conditions.

The instructions finally point out that training primary school teachers (including kindergarten educators) is a long-term task and should be gradually promoted in a planned manner. However, the proportion of teachers below the junior normal school level in the old liberated areas and minority areas is larger, and more attention should be paid to this. Each region should immediately, based on its specific conditions and in combination with the rectification of primary schools, comprehensively consider ways to improve the quality of primary school teachers and formulate a primary school teacher training plan for 1954 to 1957.

    中央人民政府教育部
    就举办小学教师轮训班发布指示
    中央人民政府教育部就举办小学教师轮训班发布指示，并规定了一年制和二年制两种小学教师轮训班教学计划（草案）。
    指示认为要办好小学教育，必须提高现有教师的质量，特别是提高不到初级师范毕业水平的教师质量。在提高教师质量的办法中，举办小学教师轮训班是主要方式之一。指示中明确规定，小学教师轮训班的主要任务是将实际文化程度在高小毕业以上，但又不足初级师范毕业程度的小学教师（包括幼儿教养员），给以一定期限的训练，使在主要学科方面能够达到初级师范毕业水平。小学教师轮训班的修业年限，依据学员实际文化程度确定，具有高小毕业及初级师范肄业一年文化程度的教师修业二年，具有初级师范肄业一年以上文化程度的教师修业一年；招生应采用行政机关选送和学校审核测验相结合的方式，招生时除应注意学员身体健康条件外，凡政治品质较好，工作积极，年龄较轻，无重大家庭负担者应先吸收学习。选送学员经学校审核测验，认为不合或暂时不合学习条件时，原选送机关仍应负责安置工作。对于各地如何执行教学计划，指示指出应掌握重点与实用的原则。既要有重点地提高学员的文化科学知识水平，又须结合小学教学工作的需要。因此在不影响教学计划要求水平的情况下，可根据当地具体条件，对科目设置和讲授时数作适当调整。关于学员的学习、待遇及毕业后的工作等问题，指示中规定：轮训班学员的成绩，分学业成绩和操行成绩两种。学业成绩经补考后仍有语文或数学一科不及格或语文、数学以外学科有两科不及格时，不得升级或毕业，但留级只限一次。操行成绩不及格时，应令退学。学习期间，学员不得请求转学；修业期满准予毕业者，由学校报经主管行政机关审查，发给小学教师轮训班毕业证书，其效用与初级师范学校毕业证书相同。毕业后由原选送机关分配工作。学员在学习期间的待遇，除按初级师范生标准发给人民助学金外，并发给补助费，其标准由各省市根据当地情况规定。
    指示中最后指出，轮训小学教师（包括幼儿教养员）是一项相当长期的任务，应有计划地逐步推行。但老解放区及少数民族地区初级师范程度以下的教师比重较大，更须予以足够的注意。各地区应即根据当地具体情况，结合整顿小学的工作，全面考虑提高小学教师质量的办法，制订一九五四年至一九五七年的小学教师轮训计划。　（新华社）
