    The summer crops this year, including wheat, have been successively entering the market. In order to firmly control grain sources, guarantee the needs of the country and the people, and ensure the supply of flour to urban industrial and mining areas, some economic crop areas, and certain rural areas, all regions must complete the planned procurement of new wheat within a certain period after the new wheat harvest.
    This year's planned procurement of new wheat has many favorable conditions. In particular, since the winter of 1953, the Party has vigorously promoted the general task of the state during the transition period in the countryside, and has achieved great success and accumulated a wealth of experience on this basis by carrying out the grain unified purchase work. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been raised, and their enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation in production and selling surplus grain to the state has also been generally enhanced. The broad masses of peasants have already understood that selling surplus grain to the state not only directly supports the construction of the country's socialist industrialization and consolidates the worker-peasant alliance, which is a glorious patriotic act, but also enables them to obtain more means of livelihood and means of production at present. In a considerable period of time in the future, with the development of the national industry, peasants can also gradually obtain various agricultural machines, further improve agricultural technology, and organize collective production, so that they can eventually get rid of poverty. This shows that the broad masses of peasants have begun to have a correct and conscious understanding of the consistency of their temporary and long-term interests, and individual and national interests, which has created good conditions for the future implementation of the state's grain planned procurement and planned supply policy and this year's summer wheat planned procurement work.
    However, since the grain planned procurement work is, after all, a new and extremely complex task, we do not have much experience, and many shortcomings and errors have occurred in some areas in the past. Therefore, this year's new wheat planned procurement work is not without difficulties. For example, some areas have not publicized the general task and grain policy deeply enough, some farmers do not have a deep enough understanding of the country's grain policy, and a few even have some misunderstandings; some cadres also have a certain degree of commandism; in addition, as the lives of farmers continue to improve, they demand to eat more refined grains, and some northern farmers cannot freely purchase flour after the implementation of planned supply, which may increase the farmers' reluctance to sell wheat. These situations will of course create some difficulties for the planned procurement of new wheat. But these difficulties are entirely surmountable. In order to complete this year's new wheat procurement task and fully grasp the grain source before the autumn grain is marketed, all regions must earnestly solve several important issues in the planned procurement of new wheat.
    Grain planned procurement is an established state policy. During the planned procurement period of new wheat, under normal circumstances, all commercial wheat must be purchased by the state in a unified way, and the state must strictly manage the market and ban speculative behavior. It is a glorious patriotic act for farmers to sell surplus grain or wheat they do not need to the state at a reasonable price set by the state. Therefore, all regions must formulate various practical, effective, simple and easy-to-implement methods to ensure wheat procurement in accordance with local actual conditions, so as to ensure the rapid and timely completion of the state's new wheat procurement task. When purchasing grain, grain purchase certificates should be filled out and handed over to the farmers, so as to uniformly calculate the farmers' annual grain sales volume during the autumn grain unified purchase. This can both stabilize farmers' emotions about selling grain and make farmers' annual grain sales tasks more reasonable; if there are shortcomings in the summer procurement work, it will also be easier to find ways to make up for them. This is one of the measures that must be taken to gradually put the planned procurement and planned supply of grain in rural areas on a systematic basis. Therefore, all regions must widely publicize to cadres and the masses the rationale for uniformly calculating farmers' annual grain sales tasks during the autumn grain unified purchase, and ensure the implementation of this measure in actual work.
    When purchasing new wheat, it is also necessary to do a good job in the planned supply of other grains in rural areas. According to past patterns, many farmers need to purchase some other grains at the same time after selling wheat. Therefore, the new wheat procurement plan and the supply plan for other grains should be adapted to each other in terms of ratios, according to the different surplus and shortage of grain in various regions. On the one hand, the state should prepare the necessary amount of other grains and supply them to farmers who sell wheat through certain procedures, and in particular, farmers who sell wheat should be allowed to purchase the necessary amount of other grains on the grain market under the leadership of the state without the participation of private merchants, through certain procedures, in order to adjust the needs of production and life. On the other hand, farmers who do not need to purchase other grains or can purchase less other grains after selling wheat should be mobilized not to purchase or purchase less other grains. Doing a good job in these two aspects can not only appropriately meet the needs of wheat farmers to exchange for other grains, but also give play to the role of the grain market in adjusting surplus and shortage of grain. Of course, all regions should also do a good job in the planned supply of grain to grain-deficient households that do not sell wheat. In short, all regions must proceed from the overall grain situation, properly grasp the planned procurement of new wheat, and earnestly do a good job in the planned supply of grain in rural areas.
    In the past, in the unified purchase of grain, farmers in many regions were able to dry and winnow the grain, so that the moisture and impurities generally did not exceed the prescribed standards, and the procurement work was able to implement the policy of "pricing according to quality" well. However, in many regions, the grain purchased had high moisture content and many impurities, affecting the quality. These regions also did not implement the policy of pricing according to quality well, and inappropriately raised the prices of low-quality grain in disguise, which should not be done. Because grain with high moisture content and many impurities is prone to mildew and deterioration, making storage difficult, increasing costs, and causing losses. The result of actually raising grain prices increases the country's expenditure, which is detrimental to the country's industrial construction, and therefore detrimental to farmers. These phenomena must be changed. The reason for these phenomena is that, objectively, the grain procurement task is very tight, the procurement work is completed within a few months, the time to put it into storage is urgent, and the quantity is very large, so the quality is difficult to control, and the policy of pricing according to quality is difficult to implement. Subjectively, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of improving quality and pricing according to quality, the propaganda and mobilization work before storage is not deep enough, and they have not relied on the rural Party committee and government organizations and mass organizations to mobilize the broad masses of grain-selling farmers to treat the work of drying, winnowing, checking grain quality and pricing according to quality before storage as a major political and economic work, and have not turned improving quality and pricing according to quality into a mass work. We must accept past experience. In this year's new wheat procurement, we must fully do a good job in the grain quality inspection work and pricing according to quality work before the grain is put into storage, and create a universal mass patriotic upsurge in rural areas of improving grain quality and selling good grain. The departments responsible for procurement should formulate certain necessary quality standards, so as to generally achieve correct implementation of the policy of pricing according to quality under the existing conditions, and oppose inappropriately raising grain prices in disguise; but due to the limitations of technical conditions, the formulation of quality standards should also be simple and easy to implement, and should not be too complicated or too strict.
    In order to adapt to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, in order to meet the needs of farmers' production and life capital turnover, and in order to fully grasp the grain source, all regions should also purchase other crops that mature at the same time as wheat this year, and early rice, middle rice, and early autumn miscellaneous grains this year according to the wheat unified purchase method. Do not ignore the procurement of other grains because of the procurement of wheat.
    During the grain purchase period, banks, cooperatives and commercial departments must work together to do a good job in the issuance and withdrawal of currency and the supply of materials. The business work of the grain department must be earnestly done well, and the work of storage, safekeeping and transportation must be well combined. This is an arduous and complex task. Party and government leading organs at all levels must attach great importance to this work, mobilize the necessary forces, further publicize the general task of the transition period to the peasants in depth, carry out full political mobilization, continue to open up the minds of cadres and peasants, take agricultural production as the center, closely combine the planned supply of grain in rural areas, and make full use of existing experience, and strive to complete and overfulfill this procurement task.

### 抓紧新麦的计划收购工作

    抓紧新麦的计划收购工作
    今年的夏季农作物，包括小麦在内，都已经陆续上市了。为了确实掌握粮源，保证国家和人民的需要，保证城市工矿地区、部分经济作物区和某些农村的面粉供应，各地必须在新麦收获后的一定时间内，完成新麦的计划收购任务。
    今年的新麦的计划收购工作有着许多有利的条件。特别因为一九五三年冬季以来，党在农村中大张旗鼓地宣传了国家过渡时期的总任务，并在这一基础上展开粮食统购工作，已经获得了巨大的成就，取得了许多经验。广大农民的社会主义觉悟提高了，互助合作发展生产并把余粮卖给国家的积极性也普遍地提高了。广大农民已经懂得了把余粮卖给国家，不但直接支持了国家社会主义工业化的建设，巩固了工农联盟，是一种光荣的爱国行为；而且可以使自己在目前获得更多的生活资料和生产资料，在一个相当时期以后，随着国家工业的发展，农民还可以逐渐获得各种农业机器，进一步改进农业技术，组织集体生产，使自己最终摆脱贫困的境地。这就说明，广大农民对自己的暂时利益和长远利益、个人利益和国家利益的一致性，已经开始有了正确的自觉的认识，这就为今后贯彻国家的粮食计划收购和计划供应政策及今年夏季小麦计划收购工作创造了良好的条件。
    但是，由于粮食计划收购工作毕竟还是一项新的而又极为复杂的工作，我们的经验还不多，而过去在某些地区也发生了不少的缺点和错误。因此，今年的新麦计划收购工作不是没有困难的。例如有些地区对总任务和粮食政策的宣传还不够深入，有些农民对国家的粮食政策了解还不够深刻，个别的甚至发生了一些误解；也有一些干部还存在着一定程度的强迫命令作风；加上农民生活不断改善，要求多吃一些细粮，而一部分北方农民在实行计划供应以后又不能随便购买面粉，这就可能增加农民对小麦的惜售心理。这些情况当然会给新麦的计划收购工作造成一些困难。但是这一些困难是完全可以克服的。为了完成今年新麦的收购任务，充分掌握秋粮上市以前的粮源，这就要求各地必须切实抓紧解决新麦计划收购工作中的若干重要问题。
    粮食计划收购是国家的一项既定的政策。在新麦计划收购期间，在一般情况下，所有商品小麦必须由国家统购下来，并由国家严格管理市场，取缔投机行为。农民把余粮或用不到的小麦按照国家合理的价格卖给国家，是一种光荣的爱国行为。因此，各地必须根据当地的实际情况，规定各种切实有效的简便易行的足以保证小麦收购的办法，以保证迅速及时地完成国家新麦的收购任务。在收购粮食的时候，应填发购粮证交给农民，以便在秋季粮食统购的时候，统一计算农民全年的售粮数量。这既可以稳定农民售粮的情绪，又能使农民全年售粮的任务更趋合理；夏季收购工作中如果有缺点，也便于设法弥补。这是使农村粮食计划收购、计划供应逐步走上制度化所必须采取的措施之一。因此，各地必须对干部、群众广泛宣传秋季粮食统购时统一计算农民全年售粮任务的道理，并在实际工作中保证这一措施的贯彻。
    在收购新麦的时候，还必须做好农村其他粮食的计划供应工作。根据过去的规律，许多农民在出售小麦之后，需要同时购进部分其他粮食。因此，应该根据各地不同的余粮、缺粮情况，使新麦收购计划和其他粮食的供应计划在比率上互相适应。一方面，国家应准备必要数量的其他粮食，经过一定手续供应给出售小麦的农民，特别应允许售麦农民经过一定手续，在国家领导下的没有私商参加的粮食市场上，购买必要数量的其他粮食，以调剂生产和生活的需要。另一方面，对那些卖出小麦以后不需要再购进其他粮食或可以少购其他粮食的农民，应动员他们不购或少购其他粮食。做好了这两方面的工作，既能适当满足麦农换购的需要，又能发挥粮食市场调剂余粮和缺粮的作用。当然，各地也应做好对那些不出卖小麦的缺粮户的粮食计划供应工作。总之，各地必须从整个粮食情况出发，妥善地掌握新麦计划收购工作，并切实作好农村粮食计划供应工作。
    过去在粮食统购中，不少地区的农民都能够做到晒干、扬净，使粮食水分、杂质一般不超出规定的标准，收购工作也能够很好贯彻“以质论价”的政策。但有不少地区收购的粮食是水分高、杂质多，影响质量，这些地区也没有很好地贯彻以质论价的政策，不恰当地变相提高了质量低的粮食的价格，这是不应该的。由于粮食水分高、杂质多，就容易霉烂变质，使得保管困难，费用增加，造成损失。而实际上提高了粮价的结果，又增加了国家的支出，对国家的工业建设是不利的，因而对农民也是不利的。这些现象必须加以改变。造成这些现象的原因，在客观上固然是由于粮食收购任务很紧，收购工作集中在几个月的时间内完成，入库时间急促，数量很大，因而质量既难于掌握，以质论价的政策也就难于贯彻。在主观上则是由于某些干部对提高质量、以质论价的意义认识不足，入库前的宣传动员工作做得不够深入，没有依靠农村党委和政府组织及群众团体，发动广大售粮农民把入库前的晒干扬净、检查粮质和以质论价工作当作一个重大的政治工作和经济工作来进行，没有把提高质量、以质论价变成群众性的工作。我们必须接受以往的经验，在今年的新麦收购中，必须充分做好粮食入库前的粮质检查工作和以质论价工作，在农村中造成一个提高粮食质量、出售好粮的普遍的群众性的爱国热潮。负责收购的工作部门要规定某些必要的质量标准，以便在现有条件下大体上做到正确贯彻以质论价政策，反对不恰当地变相提高粮价；但由于技术条件的限制，质量标准的制订，也要简便易行，不要订得过分繁杂、过分严格。
    为了适应小农经济的特点，为了满足农民生产和生活资金周转的需要，为了充分掌握粮源，各地还应该按照小麦统购的方法，对今年与小麦同期成熟的其他农作物，对今年的早稻、中稻和早秋杂粮，按照计划进行收购，不要因为收购小麦而忽略了其他粮食的收购。
    在购粮期间，银行、合作社和商业部门必须协同动作，做好货币的投放、回笼和物资的供应工作。粮食部门的业务工作更要切实作好，并把入库、保管和调运工作很好地结合起来。这是一项艰巨复杂的工作。各级党、政领导机关必须十分重视这一工作，动员必要的力量，进一步向农民深入地宣传过渡时期的总任务，进行充分的政治动员，继续打通干部和农民的思想，以农业生产为中心，密切结合农村粮食计划供应工作，充分运用已有的经验，为完成和超额完成这一收购任务而努力。
