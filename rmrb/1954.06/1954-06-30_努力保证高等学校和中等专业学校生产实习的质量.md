    Strive to Ensure the Quality of Production Internships in Universities and Secondary Vocational Schools
    According to the teaching plan, the production internships for students in universities and secondary vocational schools have already begun this year. All schools and receiving units must strengthen their leadership in this work and guarantee the quality of production internships in all aspects.
    Production internships can be broadly divided into three types: introductory internships, specialized production internships, and graduation internships. Their purpose is to verify, consolidate, and enrich the theoretical knowledge students have learned, enable students to acquire certain production and work skills and experience in scientific research work, to ensure that students can immediately take up the positions needed for the socialist construction of the motherland after graduation and undertake certain work.
    Last year, 150,000 students from universities and secondary vocational schools across the country participated in production internships. This was carried out based on learning from the Soviet Union and carrying out teaching reforms, and it was China's first guided, planned, and initially teaching-oriented internship. It differs from past internships that were divorced from teaching purposes and, based on Soviet experience, treats production internships as an organic part of the entire teaching process. Therefore, last year's production internship achieved great results and provided a lot of experience for this year's production internship.
    This year's production internships for students in universities and secondary vocational schools are larger in scale and more demanding. This is not only because more than 260,000 students are participating in internships, and the quality of introductory internships needs to be further improved, but also because this is the first time that specialized production internships are being carried out on a national scale. Both schools and receiving units generally lack experience. To ensure the quality of this year's internships, the primary issue is to correctly understand the difference between specialized production internships and introductory internships.
    The main purpose of introductory internships is to use observation methods to gain a general understanding of the production and work situation of factories, mines, and other enterprises, consolidate and verify the knowledge learned, improve students' understanding of their major, and prepare for further study of professional courses. The production internships carried out by most students last year were such introductory internships. The purpose of this year's specialized production internship is to enable students to directly participate in production operations and practical work in relevant units such as workshops, factories, farms, and laboratories that are close to their major, to acquire preliminary skills in production operations and practical work, as well as preliminary experience in scientific research work; and to enable the professional knowledge learned to be practically applied to production and work and consolidated. Based on this purpose, this year's production internships in various majors have their own new characteristics. For example, the specialized production internship for mechanical manufacturing majors in higher industrial schools is an工艺性质 (gongyi xingzhi - technological nature) internship. Students need to systematically observe, learn, and study the entire machining process of machine parts in mechanical factories according to the工艺规程 (gongyi guicheng - technological regulations) of several parts, and complete certain production tasks according to the assigned individual assignments. As for other majors, they also have their own new characteristics. If, when organizing introductory internships last year, it was possible to find a major as a typical example, summarize experience, and guide other majors, then this year it is necessary to further leverage the strength of professional teaching and research groups to organize production internships based on the characteristics of each major.
    The majors offered by various types of schools have different training goals, so the methods of production internships also have certain differences. For example, students in the chemistry and physics departments of comprehensive universities need to go to factories or factory laboratories for internships in order to become familiar with relevant enterprises. However, this is mainly to study the theoretical problems of the production process, without necessarily being familiar with the specialized mechanical knowledge and engineering calculations of the production process. The content and methods of internships in comprehensive universities have a certain degree of flexibility, and under certain conditions, it is permissible to conduct internships in the form of visits. However, for students in engineering schools, participating in practical operation occupies an important position in specialized production internships, which is important for ensuring the quality of production internships. It would be wrong to fail to thoroughly study Soviet experience, ignore the difference between specialized production internships and introductory internships, deviate from professional characteristics, lack clear internship purposes, requirements, and methods, and fail to guide students to delve into production practice to learn, resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of production internships and becoming a repetition of introductory internships. However, for some majors, it is also wrong to one-sidedly emphasize practical operation and think that the difference between specialized production internships and introductory internships lies only in practical operation. In fact, for example, the specialized production internship for mechanical manufacturing majors mainly involves observing, learning, and studying the entire machining process of machine parts based on the requirements of professional courses. Practical operation is one of the methods to achieve this goal, not the goal itself. Because most of China's current mechanical factories are engaged in batch or small-batch production, machine tool operation requires a high level of technical skill. At the same time, the factory's production tasks are generally quite heavy, and it is difficult for students to operate themselves. Under such circumstances, we should guide students to actively learn from workers and technicians in the process of in-depth study of production conditions, and try their best to participate in some necessary practical operations and beneficial production activities to enrich students' practical knowledge and experience. It is wrong to insist that students participate in operations regardless of actual conditions. If not handled properly, it may even affect production and affect the country's plan. Therefore, for this year's production internships, a unified consideration should be made based on the nature, purpose, requirements, and current production conditions of each major, and Soviet experience should be deeply studied. The difference between specialized production internships and introductory internships should be distinguished in substance, not in form.
    The complexity of specialized production internships places higher demands on teachers. Every teacher should conscientiously learn from advanced Soviet experience, thoroughly study the internship syllabus, clearly understand the nature, purpose, requirements, and methods of this internship, grasp the central link of production internships in various majors, formulate an internship plan that can both implement the internship syllabus and is practical and feasible according to the production or work situation on site in conjunction with relevant technical personnel, and appropriately select and arrange individual assignments for students. During the internship, teachers should also repeatedly teach students to study the internship syllabus, implement the internship plan, correctly grasp the policy and method of linking theory with practice, inspire students to think independently in-depth into production practice, specifically guide and help students write internship diaries and internship reports, and cultivate students' ability to collect, organize materials, analyze, study problems, and work independently. In all these tasks, no matter what difficulties are encountered, they should be actively sought ways to overcome, and the quality of the internship syllabus and internship plan should not be reduced at will. It should be known that the so-called guaranteeing the quality of production internships is first and foremost to ensure the quality of the internship syllabus and internship plan.
    Because this year's production internships are large in scale and heavy in tasks, there are not enough supervising teachers available, so it is very necessary for teachers to concentrate their energy and play a greater role in production internships. Many teachers have recognized this problem. They are diligent and hardworking in their work, conscientious and responsible, and undertake the task of guiding internships; however, some teachers have not fully recognized the new situation this year and have not thoroughly overcome the idea of ​​theory being divorced from practice in last year's internship, so they inappropriately emphasize the contradiction between guiding internships and personal advanced studies, and are unwilling to engage in the guidance of production internships, which is wrong. As a teacher, one not only needs to be good at educating students in schools, but also needs to be good at educating students in internship places, guiding students to apply the theories they have learned to production or work, and helping students correctly solve the difficulties and problems they encounter in production or work. To develop this ability, one must participate in the guidance of internships. As for teachers' personal advanced studies, they can also be combined with the work of guiding internships. In the process of guiding internships, teachers can not only discover problems in their teaching content and teaching methods, so as to seek improvement and improve their teaching level; but also discover problems in production and work, collect materials for scientific research, create better conditions for scientific research work, and improve their scientific level. Therefore, guiding internships is a comprehensive exercise for teachers, and every teacher should strive to get such an exercise.
    Specialized production internships also place higher demands on students. In specialized production internships, students have their individual assignments, and the element of independent thinking has greatly increased. Therefore, students' basic theoretical studies on weekdays and their degree of effort in the internship process directly determine the internship effect. Students participating in internships should love labor, go deep into practice, humbly seek advice, study hard, and promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and exchange experiences at any time. It is necessary to prevent the tendency of not paying attention to delving into production practice, just floating on the surface, and not seeking a thorough understanding; it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of staying in a certain practical operation or delving into individual special and complicated production problems, deviating from the internship syllabus and internship plan. In addition, special attention should be paid to observing labor discipline, strictly implementing security and confidentiality systems, cherishing state property, and preventing safety and production accidents.
    For the receiving units, specialized production internships are also a new topic. Generally speaking, the receiving units, both leaders and on-site employees, attach much more importance to production internships than last year. Some factories have made appropriate arrangements to strengthen technical guidance for internships, provide internship equipment, and arrange students' individual assignments. However, some factories only have a few responsible cadres who attach importance to production internships, but have not carried out publicity and education among technical personnel, workshop cadres, and workers, resulting in a lack of communication between superiors and subordinates, and failure to provide strong support to the school. Some still emphasize difficulties and regard production internships as a burden, and are unwilling to assign certain technical personnel to be in charge of technical guidance. If these problems cannot be properly resolved, the quality of production internships will be difficult to guarantee.
    At present, the receiving units do have heavy tasks, and there are many difficulties in all aspects. However, all units must fully estimate the significance of production internships for cultivating construction talents, overcome temporary difficulties, establish and improve internship guidance institutions, assign personnel with higher technical levels to engage in technical guidance as much as possible; conscientiously cooperate with supervising teachers to formulate internship plans, arrange students' individual assignments; combine with the specific situation of the unit, organize students to study the relevant rules and regulations on security, confidentiality, labor protection, and labor discipline; actively provide advanced equipment for students to engage in practical operations, appropriately provide reference materials necessary for internships, and assist in solving other related problems to ensure that this year's production internships achieve the expected results.

    努力保证高等学校和中等专业学校生产实习的质量
    高等学校和中等专业学校的学生，按照教学计划的规定，今年的生产实习已经开始。各学校和接受实习的单位，必须加强对这一工作的领导，从各方面保证生产实习的质量。
    生产实习大体可分为认识实习、专业生产实习和毕业实习三种，它的目的在于印证、巩固和丰富学生所学的理论知识，使学生获得一定的生产和工作的技能以及进行科学研究工作的经验，以保证学生在毕业以后，能够立即踏上祖国社会主义建设所需要的岗位，担当一定的工作。
    去年全国高等学校和中等专业学校有十五万人参加生产实习，这是在学习苏联、进行教学改革的基础上进行的，是我国第一次有领导的、有计划的、初步结合教学目的的实习。它不同于过去脱离教学目的的实习，而根据苏联经验，把生产实习作为整个教学过程的有机组成部分。因此，去年的生产实习获得了很大的成绩，并为今年的生产实习提供了不少经验。
    今年高等学校和中等专业学校学生的生产实习，规模更大，任务更重，这不仅因为参加实习的学生有二十六万多人，认识实习的质量需要进一步提高；而且因为今年第一次在全国范围内进行专业生产实习，不论学校，不论接受实习的单位，一般都很缺乏经验。要保证今年实习的质量，首要的问题是正确地理解专业生产实习和认识实习之间的区别。
    认识实习主要是用观察的方法，对厂矿和企业等单位的生产和工作情况，作一般的认识和了解，巩固和印证所学的知识，提高学生对所学专业的认识，并为进一步学好专业课程作准备。去年大多数学生所进行的生产实习，就是这样的认识实习。今年专业生产实习的目的，是使学生在与其所学专业相接近的工段、车间、农场及实验室等有关单位中，直接参加生产操作和实际工作，以获得从事生产操作和实际工作的初步技能以及进行科学研究工作的初步经验；并使所学的专业知识，能够实际应用到生产和工作中而得到巩固。基于这样的目的，今年各专业的生产实习，都有着自己的新的特点。例如高等工业学校机械制造专业的专业生产实习，是工艺性质的实习，学生要在机械工厂中按照几种零件的工艺规程，比较系统地观察、学习和研究机器零件的整个加工过程，并按照指定的个人作业，完成一定的生产任务。至于其他的专业，也各有自己的新的特点。如果说，在去年组织认识实习时，可以找一个专业作为典型，总结经验，指导其他各个专业；那么，今年就必须进一步地根据各个专业的特点，充分发挥专业教研组的力量来组织生产实习。
    各种性质的学校所设的专业，各有不同的培养目标，因而生产实习的作法也有一定的差别。例如综合大学化学系和物理系的学生，为了熟悉有关的企业，有必要到工厂或工厂的实验室去实习，不过，这主要是为了研究生产过程的理论问题，而不必熟悉生产过程的专门的机械知识和工程计算。综合大学的实习内容和方法具有一定的灵活性，在某种条件下，按照参观的方式进行实习也是允许的。但是，工科学校的学生，参加实际操作在专业生产实习中占有重要的地位，对保证生产实习的质量是有重要作用的。如果不认真钻研苏联经验，忽视专业生产实习和认识实习的区别，离开专业特点，没有明确的实习目的、要求和作法，不引导学生深入到生产实践中去学习，致使生产实习的效果降低，成为认识实习的重复，那是不对的。但是，对于某些专业来说，如果片面地强调实际操作，以为专业生产实习和认识实习的区别，仅仅在于实际操作，那也是不对的。事实上，像机械制造专业的专业生产实习，主要是根据专业课程的要求，观察、学习和研究机器零件的整个加工过程，实际操作是达到这一目的的方法之一，而不是目的本身。由于我国目前的机械工厂大多是成批或小批生产，机床操作需要较高的技术水平，同时，工厂的生产任务一般相当繁重，让学生动手操作是有一定困难的。在这种情况下，我们应当指导学生在深入研究生产情况的过程中，积极地向工人和技术人员学习，尽可能地争取参加一些必要的实际操作和有益的生产活动，以丰富学生的实际知识和经验。如果不顾实际条件，坚持要学生参加操作，那是错误的，处理不当，甚至会影响生产，影响国家的计划。所以对今年的生产实习，应当根据各专业的实习性质、目的、要求和我国目前的生产条件作统一的考虑，深入地学习苏联经验，从实质上，而不是从形式上区别专业生产实习和认识实习。
    专业生产实习的复杂性，对教师提出了更高的要求。每一个教师都应当认真地学习苏联先进经验，深入地钻研实习提纲，明确地认识这次实习的性质、目的、要求和作法，抓住各专业生产实习的中心环节，根据现场的生产或工作情况，会同有关的技术人员，制订既能贯彻实习提纲而又切实可行的实习计划，并适当地给学生选择和安排个人作业。在实习过程中，教师还应当反复地教导学生钻研实习提纲，贯彻执行实习计划，正确地掌握理论联系实际的方针和方法，启发学生深入到生产实践中独立思考，具体指导和帮助学生写作实习日记和实习报告，培养学生搜集、整理资料，分析、研究问题和独立工作的能力。在所有这些工作中，不论遇到什么困难，都应当积极地想办法去克服，决不能随意降低实习提纲和实习计划的质量。须知所谓保证生产实习的质量，首先就要保证实习提纲和实习计划的质量。
    由于今年的生产实习规模很大，任务很重，指导教师不够分配，十分需要教师集中精力，在生产实习中发挥更大的作用。许多教师已经认识到这个问题，他们在工作中辛勤刻苦，认真负责，担当了指导实习的任务；然而有的教师还没有充分认识今年的新的情况，没有在去年的实习中，彻底克服理论脱离实际的思想，以致不适当地强调了指导实习和个人进修之间的矛盾，不愿从事生产实习的指导工作，这是不对的。作为一个教师，不仅需要善于在学校里面教育学生，而且需要善于在实习场所教育学生，指导学生把所学的理论运用到生产或工作中去，帮助学生正确地解决在生产或工作中所遇到的困难和问题。要锻炼这种能力，就必须参加实习的指导工作。至于教师的个人进修，也可以和指导实习的工作结合进行。在指导实习的过程中，教师不仅可以发现自己在教学内容、教学方法上的问题，从而求得改进，提高自己的教学水平；而且可以发现生产和工作中的问题，搜集科学研究的材料，为科学研究工作创造更好的条件，提高自己的科学水平。所以指导实习，乃是对教师的一种全面的锻炼，每一个教师都应当争取得到这样的锻炼。
    专业生产实习对学生也提出了更高的要求。在专业生产实习中，学生因为有了个人作业，独立思考的成分大大增加。因此，学生平日理论学习的基础，在实习过程中的努力程度，都直接地决定着实习效果。参加实习的学生，应当热爱劳动，深入实际，虚心求教，刻苦钻研，并发扬互助友爱的精神，随时交流经验。要防止不注意深入生产实际，只是浮在表面，不求甚解的偏向；也要防止停留在某项实际操作，或者钻到个别的特殊的繁复的生产问题当中，脱离实习提纲和实习计划的偏向。此外，还应当特别注意遵守劳动纪律，严格执行保安、保密制度，爱护国家财产，防止安全、生产事故的发生。
    对于接受实习的单位来说，专业生产实习也是一个新的课题。一般说，接受实习的单位，不论领导人员和现场职工，对于生产实习的重视程度，已经比去年大大进了一步。有些工厂，对加强实习的技术指导，提供实习的设备，安排学生的个人作业，都作了适当的布置。但也有些工厂，只是少数负责干部重视生产实习，而没有在技术人员、车间干部和工人中间进行宣传教育，结果上下互不通气，不能给学校以有力的支持。有的至今仍然强调困难，视生产实习为负担，不愿意指派一定的技术人员担任技术指导的工作。这些问题如果不能恰当解决，生产实习的质量也是很难保证的。
    目前接受实习的单位，任务确实繁重，各方面的困难是不少的。但是，各单位必须充分估计生产实习对于培养建设人才的意义，克服一时的困难，建立和健全实习指导机构，尽可能地指派技术水平较高的人员从事技术指导的工作；认真地协同指导教师制订实习计划，安排学生的个人作业；结合本单位的具体情况，组织学生学习有关保安、保密、劳动保护和劳动纪律的规章制度；主动提供先进的设备，让学生从事实际操作，适当地供给实习中所必需的参考资料，并协助解决有关的其他问题，以保证今年的生产实习获得预期的效果。
