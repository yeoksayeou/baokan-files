    Post Office Helps Find Family Separated for Seventeen Years
    Min Zheng, Xi Chun, Hui Lin
    On January 16th of this year, the Hebei Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration received a registered letter from Guangxi Province. The letter began with: "I implore you to do me a favor." It continued: "My name is Yang Yinfeng, and I am twenty years old this year. I don't remember much about the past, only that during the Lugouqiao Incident, I fled with my parents. My father's name was Yang Jichun, my mother's was Zhu, and I had an older sister named Yang Xiufeng. When we were wandering in Guangxi Province, our whole family, except for me, was killed by the Japanese devils. Later, I was adopted by an old woman surnamed Wei. After the Japanese devils surrendered, I was sold as a child bride. After liberation, I saw the light of day again and joined the revolutionary work. ... I remember that my home was in Hebei Province, but I don't know which 'Ning' county, the village name is 'Dongwang Yangjia Village', and there is a third uncle named Yang Tongchun. Please use these clues to help me find my family and deliver the letter to them. I will be twelve thousand times grateful to you." The signature was Yang Yinfeng, Wholesale Department of the Liujiang County Monopoly Company, Guangxi Province.
    How much bitterness and pain this letter contained, and with what eagerness the writer was waiting for a satisfactory answer. However, this was indeed a difficult matter, because Hebei Province has three counties: Ningjin, Ningjin, and Ninghe, and each county has thousands of villages. Which village should we look for? Moreover, in the long seventeen years, people have moved and changed greatly, and the villages have also changed. It was not easy to give Yang Yinfeng a satisfactory answer.
    On January 18th, the Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration first sent a letter to the Ningjin County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, hoping that they would try their best to find it. From then on, the postmen of the Ningjin County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau carried the task of finding Yang Yinfeng's home when they went to the countryside to work. Whenever they went to a place where people gathered, they would talk to everyone and ask everyone. However, a day, two days... a month passed, and they had asked almost all the villages in the county, but still there was no news. Later, the director of the Ningjin County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau raised the matter at the ongoing Ningjin County Three-Level Cadre Conference, asking everyone to help find it. So the matter of Yang Yinfeng looking for her home quickly spread throughout the county. But after searching for more than a month, nothing was found. The Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau then notified the Ningjin County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau on March 12th to continue the search.
    After receiving the letter, Feng Zhiyi, the director of the Ningjin County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, first looked for "Dongwang Yangjia Village" on the Ningjin County map, but could not find it after searching for a long time. He called Wang Qingyi, a fifty-six-year-old postman, and asked if there was such a village in Ningjin County. Wang Qingyi thought for a while and said, "There is no Dongwang Yangjia Village, but there is a Dongwang Village." Director Feng thought, "It's been more than ten years, maybe Yang Yinfeng remembered the village name wrong." He decided to inquire in Dongwang Village first.
    One day, Ma Huanzhang, the postman of the Dongwang Village postal agency, saw the instructions from the County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau and Yang Yinfeng's original letter while sorting the mail. Without even eating, he and Comrade Li Qingshun from the agency went to the village to inquire.
    Dongwang Village is very large, with more than two thousand households. They asked many people who said they didn't know, but they didn't lose heart and continued to search. Finally, they met an old man in his sixties and asked:
  "Old man, do you know if there is anyone named Yang Tongchun in this village?" The old man looked up at them and said, "Yes, I'll take you there." The old man led them into a house, and a person came out of the house. The old man pointed and said, "This is Yang Tongchun." Postman Ma Huanzhang breathed a sigh of relief, took Yang Yinfeng's letter from his pocket, and handed it to Yang Tongchun, saying: "We received a letter from Yang Yinfeng looking for her home, see if it is right?" It turned out that the old man who led the way was called Yang San, and he was Yang Yinfeng's uncle. When he heard that Yang Yinfeng had sent a letter, he quickly gathered around to read it. After reading the letter, Yang Tongchun was so moved that he couldn't speak, and Yang San was so moved that he shed tears. Yang San said: "Yang Yinfeng's family was killed by the enemy. I still thought about this when sweeping the graves during Qingming." Yang Tongchun said: "I thought Yang Yinfeng was long gone, who knew she was still alive and participating in the revolutionary work. Our family, which has been separated for seventeen years, can be reunited again."
    Yang Tongchun has already received Yang Yinfeng's family letter, which is full of the joy of finding a home and the excitement of loving the new society.

    邮电局帮助找到了离散十七年的家
    敏政、锡纯、辉林
    今年一月十六日，河北省邮电管理局收到一封从广西省寄来的挂号信。信里劈头一句就是：我拜托你们办一件事情。接着写道：“我的名字叫杨银凤，今年二十岁。过去的事情我都记不大清楚了，只是记得芦沟桥事变那年，跟父母逃难出来。父亲叫杨际春，母亲朱氏，还有一个姐姐杨秀凤。我们流浪到广西省时，一家人就被日本鬼子杀害得只剩下我这一个人了。后来我被一个姓韦的老大娘收养。日本鬼子投降后，我被卖给人家做童养媳。解放了，我重见了天日，参加了革命工作。……我记得我家是在河北省，只是不知道是‘宁’什么县，村庄的名字叫‘东汪杨家庄’，有个三叔叫杨同春。请你们依照这些线索，帮助我找到家，把信交给他们，我是十二万分地感谢你们的。”下款写着广西省柳江县专卖公司批发部杨银凤的姓名。
    这封信含着多少辛酸痛楚，写信的人又是怀着多么渴望的心情在期待着圆满的回答。不过，这确实是一件难办的事情，因为河北省有宁津、宁晋、宁河三个县，每个县都有千百个村庄，究竟到那个村庄去找呢？而且在漫长的十七年当中，人的流动变化很大，村庄也变了，要圆满答复杨银凤，是多么不容易呀。
    一月十八日，省邮电管理局先给宁津县邮电局去了一封信，希望他们想尽办法查找。从此，宁津县邮电局的邮递员们下乡工作时，就带着查找杨银凤家的任务，他们每到一个人群聚集的地方，逢人就说，见人就问。可是，一天、两天……一个月过去了，他们几乎问遍了全县的村庄，依然没有下落。后来，宁津县邮电局的局长在正在召开的宁津县三级干部会议上提出了这件事，请大家帮助找。于是杨银凤找家的事很快就传遍了全县。但是找了一个多月都没有找到。省邮电局就又在三月十二日通知宁晋县邮电局继续查找。
    宁晋县邮电局局长冯志义接到信后，先在宁晋县地图上找“东汪杨家庄”，找了半天，没有。他就把五十六岁的老邮递员王庆义叫了来，问宁晋县是不是有这个村子。王庆义想了想说：“没有东汪杨家庄，不过倒是有个东汪村。”冯局长想：“十几年的事了，可能是杨银凤把村名记错了。”他决定先在东汪村询问一下。
    一天，东汪村邮政代办所邮递员马焕章在分信时，看到了县邮电局的指示和杨银凤的原信，他没顾得吃饭，就和代办所的李庆顺同志一同到村里去打听。
    东汪村很大，有两千多户人家。他们问了好多人都说不知道，但是他们并不灰心，继续往前找。最后，他们碰到了一个六十来岁的老人，问道：
  “老大伯，你知道这村有个叫杨同春的吗？”老人抬起头来，看了看他们说：“有，我领你们去。”老人领着他们走进一家门口，这时从屋里走出一个人来。老人指着说：“这就是杨同春。”邮递员马焕章轻松地吐了一口长气，从口袋里掏出了杨银凤的信，交给了杨同春说：“我们接到了一封杨银凤找家的信，你看对不对？”原来领路的那位老人叫杨三，是杨银凤的姑父。他听说是杨银凤来了信，便也赶紧围上来看。看完了信，杨同春感动得一下子说不出话来，杨三感动得流下泪来。杨三说：“银凤的一家人都被敌人打死了，在清明扫墓时，我还想起这事来呢。”杨同春说：“我以为银凤这孩子早不在人世了，谁知道现在还活着，还参加了革命工作。我们这离散了十七年的家又可以团圆了。”
    杨同春已经接到杨银凤的家信，这封信充满着找到了家的喜悦和对新社会热爱的激动。
