Heroic Builders of the Motherland
    ——Visiting the Workers Building the Anshan Iron and Steel Second Thin Plate Mill
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Sun Minghui, Zhang Xiangbo
    On the eve of the completion of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s Second Thin Plate Mill, reporters visited the workers building this factory. In the thin plate mill, people often compare the construction site to a battlefield and the construction to a battle, and this is not an exaggeration. Here, whether it is installing huge steel beams in the air tens of feet high, or pouring foundations in steel mesh more than twenty feet deep underground; whether it is installing large and precise machines; or welding various pipes in the ditches, many difficulties are encountered almost every day. However, all these difficulties have been overcome by the heroic builders. Just when the construction was at its most intense, one day, the riggers of the mechanical installation team used a "tie-in" to lift a crane prepared for installation. While it was suspended in mid-air, the winch driving the "tie-in" suddenly broke down. The fourteen-ton crane frame swung back and forth, causing the "tie-in" soaring into the sky to shake wildly. If this dangerous situation continued, not only would the crane frame and "tie-in" be smashed, but also the factory building and the poured foundation would be damaged, causing great losses to the entire project. At this tense moment, a worker, like a soldier charging through artillery fire, directed everyone to leave the dangerous area while rushing to the winch and quickly repairing the damaged area. The giant crane frame was soon stably suspended in the place where it should be installed. The person who risked his life to repair the machine was Wang Qingsheng, an old rigger with more than twenty years of experience. When asked what force supported him in doing this, he simply said: "There was no time to think about anything at that time, but when I saw that the project was going to be affected, I didn't care about the danger!"
    People who have worked on construction sites for a long time know that building a large factory is extremely difficult and intense. Last September, a section of the factory building's large wall needed to be built in a short period of time so that the next process could be carried out successively. In order to complete this task, many workers in the bricklaying team of the third work section responsible for the construction moved to the construction site to live, working day and night in two shifts. During the construction, it rained heavily for several days, and the workers carrying bricks often fell on the muddy road, and their clothes were soaked by the rain, but no one asked to rest. The work section director, the Party branch secretary, and the technicians also worked day and night on the site like the workers. Technician Wang Zhonghui often slept only three or four hours a day in order to guide the workers on site, and his eyes were bloodshot, but he still persevered. The workers' intense labor enabled the task that usually required more than a month to complete to be completed in only ten days and nights. At the beginning of February this year, the construction of the last section of the gas pipeline outside the factory began. This section of the pipeline happened to pass over the crane of the primary rolling mill. In order not to affect the production of the primary rolling mill too much, the riveters, welders, riggers, and other workers of the metal structure engineering team participating in the construction of this project decided to carry out the construction as quickly as possible. Those days, the weather was particularly cold, and snowflakes fell on the thick pipes, quickly condensing into a layer of ice. However, the riggers, riveters, and welders were not afraid at all. When they were too cold to bear, they went to the ground to stomp their feet and ran for a while, and then went back to work. The work of welding the seams in the pipeline was particularly difficult. People who welded in that thin air pipeline for half an hour would have their snow-white masks smoked into khaki by the welding rod smoke; if the welding time was too long, people would feel dizzy. However, the welders often insisted on working there continuously for several hours. The old worker Liu Hanxiang was originally recuperating at home. When he learned that this project was urgent and there were few welders, he automatically ran to participate in the work. He and the young worker Tang Dewen sometimes welded in that stuffy pipeline for four hours at a stretch, until they had exhausted all their strength and had difficulty breathing before they were willing to come out. On the evening of the Spring Festival, at seven o'clock, people's hard work finally led to the victory of the project construction.
    We spent a long time visiting the construction site, seeing how those precise machines were firmly installed on smooth foundations, seeing those winding pipes and ingenious heating furnaces, and we further experienced why the workers were so enthusiastically pursuing the latest technology and why they had to spend days and nights racking their brains for a small creation! Because they knew that building such a complex modern factory required not only courage and a high degree of responsibility, but also skillful techniques and wisdom. On the construction site, we met the old fitter Shen Xiqi, who came to Anshan from Shanghai to participate in the construction. When the thin plate mill began construction, he led a team to undertake the installation of an important machine, which was a first for them. The members of this team were all southerners. In order to facilitate the learning of Soviet advanced installation technology and the installation experience of other teams, they used every opportunity to learn the northern dialect and first overcame the language barrier. When the formal installation began, after a day of hard work, they used their only rest time to ask technicians to explain the operating procedures, mechanical principles, and installation drawings, and often held team meetings to study installation techniques. During the installation process, in order to learn how to install a certain part using new methods, this old worker with more than twenty years of experience often stood next to the machine for several hours to observe how others installed it. Sometimes, when other teams were installing in very deep ditches, he or other workers in the team also climbed into the oily ditches and squatted or lay down to learn from others' installation experience. After more than a year of hard study, he and the workers in the team all learned the skills to install modern machines and learned many Soviet advanced experiences such as hot fitting and hot unloading. The certain number precision rolling mill they installed not only completed the installation task ahead of schedule, but also reached zero point in elevation and level
    (not a single difference), and was praised by Soviet experts. In the office of an engineering team at the thin plate mill construction site, we also visited Liu Hongxiang, a creative expert among the electrical installation workers. Over the past year, Liu Hongxiang has put forward more than ten rationalization proposals through tireless research, improved many tools, and solved major problems in the project. On the basis of the advanced experience of bending pipes created by labor model Lü Baofang, he successively created four pipe bending tools, which made the working efficiency of pipe bending more than twice the quota, greatly accelerating the progress of cable pipe installation. On the construction site, we also met the fitter Xie Xueyong, who created the lifting and moving inclined iron device. Last winter, Xie Xueyong's team encountered a major difficulty in installing a roll grinder. The base of this machine weighed 35 tons. Because there was no support point near the machine, the original inclined iron device for moving the machine could not exert force, so it was very difficult to move it when leveling and correcting. This would not only delay the project, but also make it difficult to ensure the quality. Everyone was very anxious. During those days, this old worker not only could not eat, but also could not sleep peacefully, and often stood in front of the machine in a daze. One day, he finally created an inclined iron device with a rolling device with the help of the workers in his team. With this inclined iron device, the difficulty of the machine not being able to move arbitrarily was solved, and the installation quality exceeded the standards stipulated in the design. After inspecting this machine and learning about Xie Xueyong's creation, the Soviet expert shook the old worker's hand tightly and said excitedly: "It is not easy for this machine to reach this standard. If everyone works like you, China will build socialism faster!"

    祖国英勇的建设者
    ——访问建设鞍钢第二薄板厂的职工们
    新华社记者　孙铭惠、张向波
    鞍山钢铁公司第二薄板厂建设完工前夕，记者访问了建设这个工厂的职工们。在薄板厂，人们常把工地比作战场，把施工比作战斗，这是一点也不夸张的。在这里，不论是在几丈高的空中安装巨大的钢梁；或是在两丈多深的地下钢筋网里浇灌基础；也不论是安装庞大而精密的机器；或是在地沟里焊接各种管道，几乎每天都要遇到许多困难。但是，所有这些困难，都被英雄的建设者战胜了。正当施工最紧张的时候，有一天，机械安装工程队的架工们用“铁抱子”吊起一个准备安装的吊车，正吊在半空时，带动“铁抱子”的卷扬机突然坏了，十四吨重的吊车架向回一摆动，震动得高耸云空的“铁抱子”乱抖。这种危险的情况再继续下去，不但要摔碎吊车架和“铁抱子”，并且还会碰坏厂房和浇灌好的基础，使整个工程受到很大损失。就在这紧张的一瞬间，有一个工人像冒着炮火冲锋的战士，一边指挥大家离开险地，一边冲向卷扬机，迅速地把损坏的地方修理好。巨型的吊车架很快又安稳地吊在应该安装的地方。这个冒着生命危险抢修机器的人，就是有二十多年工龄的老架工王清盛。当人问他是什么力量支持他这样做的时候，他只简短地说：“当时没有时间考虑什么，不过看见工程要受到影响，就顾不得什么危险不危险了！”
    长期工作在工地上的人们，都知道建设一座大工厂是极为艰苦和紧张的。去年九月，有一段厂房大墙需要在短期内砌出来，以便下一道工序相继施工。为了完成这一任务，负责施工的三工段瓦工队的许多工人都搬到工地来住，分两班日夜不停地工作。在施工中下了几天大雨，挑砖的工人在泥泞的路上经常跌倒，衣服被雨淋透了，却没有一个人要求休息。工段主任、党的支部书记和技术人员，也和工人一样日夜工作在现场上。技术员王忠惠为了在现场指导工人施工，常常一天只睡三四个钟头，眼睛里挂上了红丝，仍然坚持着。职工们这样紧张的劳动，使平时需要一个多月才能完成的任务，只十多个日夜就完成了。今年二月初，厂外最后一节瓦斯管道工程开始施工了。这一节管道正好通过初轧厂的吊车上边，为了不太多地影响初轧厂生产，参加这一工程施工的金属结构工程队的铆工、电焊工、架工等工人，决定以最快的速度施工。那几天，天气特别冷，雪花落到粗大的管道上，很快就凝结成一层冰。但是，架工、铆工和电焊工们，一点没有畏惧，冷得实在受不了时，就到地面上跺脚跑一阵，又上去干活了。焊接管道里缝的工作尤其艰难，人们在那空气稀薄的管道里焊上半个小时，雪白的口罩就会叫焊条烟熏成土黄色；焊的时间长了，人会头昏脑胀。但是电焊工人却常常在那里连续坚持几个小时。老工人刘汉祥原来在家里养病，当他知道这个工程紧急，电焊工人又少时，就自动跑来参加了工作。他和青年工人唐德文，有时在那闷人的管道里一气焊四个小时，直到他们全身的气力用尽，呼吸困难时才肯出来。到春节那天晚上七点钟，人们艰苦的努力，终于换取了工程建设的胜利。
    我们曾用了很长时间去参观施工现场，看到那些精密的机器如何牢实地安装在光滑的基础上，看到那些蜿蜒曲折的各种管道和精巧的加热炉，我们进一步体验到职工们为什么那样热情地追求着最新的技术，那样为了一个小小的创造而要花费几天几夜的脑筋！因为他们知道：建设这样一个复杂的现代化工厂，需要的不仅是勇敢和高度负责的精神，而且还需要熟练的技巧和智慧。在工地上，我们曾遇到过老钳工沈锡岐，他是自动从上海来鞍山参加建设的。薄板厂开始建设时，他领导一个小组，担负一台重要机器的安装，这对他们来说还是第一次。这个小组的成员都是南方人，为了便于学习苏联先进的安装技术和别的小组的安装经验，他们利用一切机会学习北方话，首先克服了语言上的障碍。正式安装开始时，在劳累一天之后，他们又利用仅有的休息时间请技术人员讲操作规程、机械原理和安装图纸，并常常召开小组会研究安装技术。在安装过程中，为了学会用新方法安装某一个部件，这位有二十多年工龄的老工人，常常好几小时地站在机器旁边观摩别人安装的情形。有时，别的组在很深的地沟下进行安装，他或是小组的其他工人，也爬到油污的地沟里蹲着或是躺着学习别人的安装经验。经过一年多的艰苦学习，他和小组的工人都学会了安装现代化机器的本领，学会了热装热卸等许多苏联先进经验。他们安装的某号精轧机，不但提前完成了安装任务，而且标高和水平都达到了零点
  （一道不差），受到了苏联专家的赞扬。在薄板厂工地一个工程队的办公室里，我们又访问了电气安装工人中的创造能手刘洪祥。一年来，刘洪祥经过艰苦不懈地研究，共提出了十多件合理化建议，改进了不少工具，解决了工程上的重大问题。他在劳动模范吕宝芳创造的弯管子的先进经验的基础上，前后创造了四件弯管子的工具，使弯管子的工作效率超过了定额两倍多，大大加快了电缆管安装的进度。在工地上，我们还会见了创造升降移动斜铁器的钳工谢学拥。去年冬天，谢学拥小组安装轧辊磨床遇到了一个重大的困难。这台机器底座重有三十五吨。由于机器附近没有支撑点，原有的移动机器的斜铁器使不上力量，因此找平找正时移动一下非常困难，这不但要使工程延期，而且难以保证质量。大家非常着急。这位老工人在那些日子里不但吃不下饭，连觉也睡不安稳，常常站在机器前边发呆。有一天，他终于在本组工人的帮助下，创造了带有滚动装置的斜铁器。有了这种斜铁器，就解决了机器不能任意移动的困难，安装质量也超过了设计规定的标准。苏联专家在检查了这台机器并了解了谢学拥的创造后，紧紧地握着这位老工人的手，兴奋地说：“这台机器达到这样标准很不容易，都像你这样干，中国就会更快地建成社会主义！”
