Lenin on State Capitalism
Fan Ruoyu

I.

Around the time of the October Revolution (1917 to the spring of 1918), Lenin, based on Marx's insights about the need for a transition period from capitalism to socialism, and drawing from the actual situation in Russia at the time, stipulated the Bolshevik Party's policies for the transition period. One of the important policies Lenin stipulated at the time was the implementation of state capitalism under the conditions of the proletariat holding state power.

Lenin believed at the time that Russia needed to go through a period of socialist statistics and supervision in the transition from capitalism to socialism. He said: "Without this period of socialist accounting and supervision, it is impossible to approach the lower stage of communism." ("The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department") He also said: "What is state capitalism under the Soviet regime? Implementing state capitalism at the present time means implementing the statistics and supervision that the capitalist class has carried out." ("Report on the Current Tasks of the Soviets") What Lenin meant at the time by implementing socialist statistics and supervision over capitalism was to implement state capitalism under the conditions of the proletarian regime. In September and October 1917, Lenin wrote: "The 'crux' of the matter is not even in confiscating the property of the capitalists, but in implementing comprehensive worker supervision over the capitalists and their various possible supporters. Confiscation alone will not accomplish anything, because this method does not contain elements of organized and statistically correct distribution. It is easy for us to replace confiscation with the collection of fair taxes (even at the 'Shingarev' tax rate) – but it is necessary to eliminate any possibility of evading responsibility, concealing the truth, and circumventing the law. And this possibility can only be eliminated by worker supervision by the worker state." ("Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?") From this, it can be seen that Lenin at that time envisioned that after the proletariat seized power, it would not necessarily immediately confiscate all the property of capitalist enterprises, that is, not first implement the nationalization of all industries, but first implement worker supervision. This method of supervising capitalism is state capitalism.

Whenever Lenin talked about the policy of state capitalism he put forward in 1917 and 1918, he always instructed people to understand its necessity and possibility from the following actual conditions of a small-peasant country in the transition period. These actual conditions were: 1. The existence of various different economic components; 2. The dominance of small production; 3. The proletariat holding state power.

Lenin pointed out that the form of the transition period between socialism and capitalism would largely depend on whether large private property or small private property, large agriculture or small agriculture, was dominant. In countries where capitalism is less developed, "small private property" and "small agriculture" exist in greater quantities. The greater the existence of this economic component, the longer and more difficult the transition to socialism will be. Because transitioning this economic component to socialism is not as easy or simple as transitioning capitalist "large private property" and "large agriculture" to socialism. Therefore, Lenin said:

"What indirect paths, methods, means, and auxiliary measures are needed to transition pre-capitalist relations to socialism? The whole key lies here." ("On the Food Tax")

When analyzing the economic situation of the Soviet Union in the early transition period, Lenin pointed out that there were five different socio-economic structures: patriarchal, i.e., largely primitive economics, small commodity production (including most farmers selling grain), private capitalism, state capitalism, and socialism. Among these five different economic components, the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie obviously dominated at the time. Under these circumstances, the proletariat seized power and confiscated capitalist enterprises into socialist economic components, but capitalism was not completely eliminated as a result. It was still inevitable to some extent. Because capitalism is a spontaneous product of small commodity economic production and exchange, as long as a large amount of small production exists, capitalism will inevitably be produced, and the proletarian regime cannot confiscate and expel small producers who spontaneously generate capitalism. Therefore, in the transition period, the economic component of capitalism inevitably exists to some extent and for a certain period. Lenin pointed out:

"Then, what does the word 'transition' mean? Does it economically mean that in this system there are both capitalist and socialist components, parts, or elements? Everyone admits that this is the case." (Ibid.)

Since the capitalist economic component inevitably exists in the transition period, what kind of policy should the proletariat, which holds state power, adopt towards it? Is it to completely prohibit and close off the occurrence and development of capitalism? Is it to allow capitalism to run rampant freely? Or is it to adopt proper methods to utilize and restrict capitalism, and finally ensure that it is transformed into socialism? The proletariat and its political party, which lead the country, must choose among these three.

Some people believed that capitalism was a scourge and socialism was a blessing, and therefore advocated that the inevitable capitalism in the transition period should be dealt with head-on, and its development should be immediately and completely prohibited and closed off. Lenin believed that this idea forgot the entire sum of the existing socio-economic structure in the transition period. It should be known that in the transition period, in addition to the two economic components of capitalism and socialism, there are other economic components, especially a large number of small productions. Lenin pointed out: "Capitalism is indeed a scourge compared with socialism. But compared with the medieval system, with small production, with the bureaucracy connected to the disorganization of small producers, capitalism is a blessing." (Ibid.) Therefore, Lenin also pointed out that if a political party attempts to implement a policy of complete prohibition or closure for all developments of capitalism that inevitably occur under the conditions of the existence of millions of small producers, "it is not only stupid, but also suicidal. It is stupid because this policy is economically unworkable; it is suicidal because the party that attempts to implement this kind of policy will inevitably go bankrupt." (Ibid.)

Some people also believed that since capitalism is inevitable, it should be allowed to develop freely "naturally," and therefore advocated not restricting, managing, or supervising the development of capitalism. Lenin pointed out that this was also very wrong. He said: "Many errors in economic problems arise from a failure to understand this fact. Speculators, profiteers, monopoly breakers—these are our main 'internal' enemies, the enemies of the Soviet regime in economic facilities. ... We know very well that the economic foundation of speculation lies in the small private owners who are very widespread in Russia, and in the private capitalism that has its own agents in every petty bourgeois." (Ibid.)

From this, it can be seen that in the transition period, the state where the proletariat holds power cannot immediately and completely prohibit or close off the development of the capitalist component, which is inevitable to some extent, nor can it allow it to run rampant freely without restriction. So, what is the only rational and possible policy? This is state capitalism. Lenin pointed out:

"The whole problem—both theoretically and practically—is to find the right method, how to guide the inevitable (inevitable to some extent and for a certain period) development of capitalism onto the track of state capitalism, what conditions must rely on, and how to ensure that state capitalism becomes socialism in the near future." (Ibid.)

"Since we are still unable to achieve a direct transition from small production to socialism, capitalism—which is a spontaneous product of small production and exchange—is inevitable within a certain range, so we should also utilize capitalism as an intermediate link between small production and socialism, as a means, path, method, and way to improve productivity (especially to guide it onto the track of state capitalism)." (Ibid.)

After reading the above two quotations, it can be known that the purpose of implementing state capitalism within a certain period and within a certain range during the transition period is to utilize the inevitable capitalism under the condition of small production as a means and method to improve productivity, and gradually transform it into socialism. Therefore, Lenin also pointed out that state capitalism "is a kind of capitalism that we can allow and should allow."

However, some people are still worried: Although state capitalism is a kind of capitalism that should be allowed, allowing capitalism is ultimately dangerous. For this reason, Lenin repeatedly explained: "Whoever is the organizer of the state capitalist enterprise can turn it into his own assistant" ("Report on the Current Tasks of the Soviets"). Because state capitalism under the capitalist regime and state capitalism under the proletarian regime are two different concepts. State capitalism in capitalist countries supports the interests of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat; while state capitalism in the proletarian state is for the benefit of the working class, and its purpose is to resist and fight against the bourgeoisie. Lenin said: "We don't want people to understand that when we say 'state,' this state is us, it is the proletariat, it is the vanguard of the working class. State capitalism is a kind of capitalism that we can limit, and we can define its boundaries." ("Political Report of the Central Committee to the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (B)")

In short: The policy of state capitalism implemented in the state where the proletariat holds power is a policy that utilizes inevitable capitalism as a means and method to improve productivity for the benefit of the working class, a policy that restricts it in order to oppose bourgeois speculation and anarchic production, and a policy that overcomes the spontaneous forces of small production in order to transition to socialism. Lenin pointed out: "It should be known that this is a completely unprecedented situation in history: the proletariat, that is, the revolutionary vanguard, possesses extremely sufficient state power, while state capitalism coexists at the same time. The key to the problem is to make us understand that this is a kind of capitalism that we can allow and should allow, and a kind of capitalism that we can restrict and should restrict." (Ibid.)

For the above reasons, the Soviet regime promulgated the "Regulations on Worker Supervision" drafted by Lenin in the first few days of its establishment. In this regulation, only the following is stipulated for capitalist enterprises: "To implement methods for workers to supervise all matters related to the production, storage, and sale of products and raw materials." ("Draft Regulations on Worker Supervision") Later, Lenin recalled in another article: "One of the first decrees promulgated at the end of 1917 was the decree on the state's monopoly of the advertising business. What does this decree contain? It contains the meaning that the proletariat, which has acquired state power, intends to transition to new socio-economic relations as gradually as possible—not to abolish private newspapers, but to subordinate them to certain state leadership and guide them onto the normal track of state capitalism. Therefore, the decree stipulating the state's monopoly of the advertising business assumed that private entrepreneurial newspapers, as a general phenomenon, would continue to exist, and the economic policy of private advertising business would also continue, and the system of private property would continue to exist, and a whole series of private enterprises that require advertising and advertising business would continue to exist. The meaning of the decree on the monopoly of the private advertising business is this, and can only be this. There are similar situations in the decree on the banking business." ("On the New Economic Policy") From here, we can also see that in the initial days after the October Revolution, that is, from the end of 1917 to the spring of 1918, Lenin still envisioned not confiscating all capitalist enterprises for the time being, but guiding capitalism towards state capitalism, and completing the transition to socialism as gradually, gently, and cautiously as possible.

However, the development of class struggle at that time prevented the above-mentioned decrees belonging to state capitalist measures from being implemented. Because the Russian bourgeoisie initially responded to these decrees of the Soviet regime with strikes. The first to appear was the strike of counter-revolutionary bank officials. Therefore, in December 1917, the Soviet regime promulgated the decree on the nationalization of banks to eliminate this strike. After that, the bourgeoisie continued to resist the Soviet regime with strikes, factory closures, and even launching a civil war. Therefore, the proletarian state also announced the confiscation of the bourgeoisie's means of production and means of production with a series of decrees.

Initially, that is, in the spring of 1918, the Soviet regime wanted to use the method of worker supervision to guide capitalism onto the track of state capitalism. However, what the Russian bourgeoisie dreamed of at that time was to fundamentally overthrow the Soviet regime. Of course, there was no question of obeying the laws of the proletarian state and accepting worker supervision. This situation, as Lenin said, "The enemy, that is, the capitalist class, responded to this decree of the state power with actions that completely denied the entire state power. (referring to the decree on advertising, etc. -- quoted by the author) There is no question of any advertising business at all, because everything bourgeois capitalism that was left in our system at that time concentrated all its forces on fighting for the very foundation of the state power. We once suggested to the capitalists: 'Obey the regulation of the state, obey the state power, and in this way, you can avoid completely abolishing the conditions that are suitable for the old interests, habits, and viewpoints of the people, and you can use the method of state regulation to gradually change all of this', but people raised the question of our own survival. The strategy adopted by the capitalist class was to push us to engage in a life-and-death and ruthless struggle, and this struggle forced us to destroy the old relations to an extent that was infinitely greater than we had originally planned." (Ibid.) Lenin's remarks clearly explained why state capitalism was not implemented after the October Revolution. Originally, the proletariat "suggested" to the capitalists that they obey the state power of the proletariat and take the road of state capitalism, so that capitalist relations could be gradually changed and transition to socialism. However, the bourgeoisie rejected this road. They wanted to maintain capitalist relations and push the proletariat to engage in a life-and-death and ruthless struggle. The reason why the Russian bourgeoisie dared to openly resist the state power of the proletariat at that time was also, as Lenin said, "How can the bourgeoisie suddenly obey this brand-new and unprecedented proletarian power without directly fighting to test its strength in this regard?" (Ibid.) Since the bourgeoisie wanted to directly fight with the then only and newly born proletarian state power in the world to test its strength, the proletariat had to give it a strong counterattack and confiscate capitalist enterprises to destroy the economic foundation of the bourgeoisie. The outcome of this direct fight proved that the bourgeoisie no longer had the power to preserve capitalist relations. On the contrary, the destruction of capitalist relations was infinitely greater than the proletariat had originally planned. This is the reason why the Soviet Union did not implement state capitalism in 1918 and had to "attack capital with the Red Guards."

Although the development of class struggle after the October Revolution prevented the policy of state capitalism from being implemented at that time and had to "attack capital with the Red Guards," this does not prove that the policy of guiding capitalism to state capitalism and gradually transitioning to socialism under certain historical conditions is wrong. Regarding this point, Lenin later commented: "Naturally, now, when evaluating events from the perspective of the future historical development after this, we cannot but think that this decree of ours (referring to the decree on the advertising business quoted earlier -- quoted by the author) was too naive and to some extent wrong, but at the same time, this decree also contains something correct, that is, the state power—the proletariat—attempted to implement the transition to new social relations, and as gradually as possible and as without special destruction as possible, and as adapted to the existing relations at that time." (Ibid.) That is to say, although the development of events was different from what was originally envisioned, it cannot be denied that the transition is necessary, nor can it be thought that the transition does not need to be gradual and steady and can be carried out regardless of all special destruction and the existing relations at that time.

II.

During the period of the civil war, in order to defeat the armed intervention of foreign imperialism and to put down the counter-revolutionary rebellions of domestic landlords and the bourgeoisie, the Soviet Union had to adopt the policy of war communism. When the civil war ended in victory, the Soviet Union changed from the policy of war communism to the New Economic Policy. Lenin summarized the experience at that time and said: "By the spring of 1921, it had become clear that we had suffered a defeat in our attempt to transition to socialist production and distribution principles in a 'storm' manner, that is, in the shortest, fastest, and most direct way. The political situation in the spring of 1921 pointed out to us that in many economic problems, it was inevitable to retreat to the position of state capitalism, and to change from a 'storm' to a 'siege'." (Ibid.) Especially under the circumstances of severe economic damage at that time, in order to restore industry and improve the lives of workers and peasants, it was still necessary to implement state capitalism. However, the specific form of state capitalism implemented since the spring of 1921 was different from the state capitalism envisioned in the spring of 1918. The state capitalism envisioned in the spring of 1918, as we have already talked about above, was not to first implement the confiscation of all capitalist enterprises, but to guide the capitalist enterprises that had not yet been confiscated to the track of state capitalism through the method of state supervision; while the state capitalism implemented in 1921 was to "retreat" a part of the enterprises that had already been confiscated into state ownership to the track of state capitalism in the form of concessions, leases, etc. But this is just a different approach to state capitalism under different historical circumstances. As for the significance of state capitalism under the conditions of the proletariat holding state power, whether in the spring of 1918 or the spring of 1921, Lenin's works equally emphasized opposing the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie - "the main enemy" during this period, equally denied that it was possible to directly transition to socialism during this period, and equally emphasized that some transitional methods of economic construction should be adopted, and state capitalism should be implemented locally as a tool to oppose the bourgeoisie and the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, and as an economic form that is higher than private capitalism that is not subject to this state control and higher than small production.

After 1921, the state capitalism that the Soviet Union once implemented mainly had two forms, namely the concession system and the leasing system. These two forms of state capitalism are external cooperation between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy. There are no socialist economic components within state capitalist enterprises. For example, for the concession system, Lenin pointed out: "What is the concession system under the Soviet system? This is a contract, alliance, or alliance formed by the Soviet regime, that is, the state power of the proletariat, with state capitalism in order to oppose the spontaneous forces of small private owners (patriarchal, petty bourgeois). The lessee is the capitalist. They operate in a capitalist way in order to obtain profits. They sign contracts with the proletarian regime in order to obtain extra profits higher than ordinary profits, or in order to obtain raw materials that cannot be obtained or are very difficult to obtain by other methods. The benefits obtained by the Soviet regime are the development of productive forces, that is, to increase the quantity of products immediately or in a very short period of time." ("On the Food Tax") The ownership of the enterprises leased by capitalists from the state is of course the state's, and the lease contract must first be based on the principle of benefiting the state, but this is only the external relationship between capitalism and the proletarian state. As for the inside of these enterprises, within the years stipulated in the contract, they are operated by capitalists in a capitalist manner, and the profits obtained by capitalists are also extra profits higher than ordinary profits. Therefore, Lenin said: "Let everyone be engaged in management! Capitalists will work side by side with you, ... they will extract hundreds of percent of profits from you, and they will make a fortune near us. Let them make a fortune, but you must learn management and operation from them." ("The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department") Regarding the leasing system, Lenin pointed out: It is "the state leases certain state-owned places or production areas, woodlands, land, etc. to entrepreneurial capitalists, and the lease contract is very similar to the concession contract." ("On the Food Tax")

As mentioned earlier, in 1921, because the socialist industry in the Soviet Union was still underdeveloped and could not meet the demand of farmers for a large number of commodities, Lenin believed that implementing state capitalism was the most appropriate method, because through the method of state capitalism, a connection between the Soviet regime and the countryside could be established, that is, a connection with the vast small producers. Therefore, Lenin once envisioned that state capitalism might become the basic form of the Soviet economy at that time. Under this vision, Lenin at that time also took the cooperative system and observed it in coordination with state capitalism, which was undoubtedly correct in the specific historical situation of 1921. However, from 1921 onwards, the situation in the Soviet Union underwent major changes. In the near future, the socialist industry, state-owned commerce, and cooperative commerce of the Soviet Union had become the dominant force. The vast small producers had been combined with the socialist industry, and the Soviet state had been able to use its own strength to establish a connection between urban and rural areas, that is, to establish a connection between socialist industry and vast small producers. At this time, the cooperative system was already cooperating with the socialist industry. Therefore, as early as 1923, Lenin no longer observed the cooperative system in coordination with state capitalism, but observed the cooperative system from another perspective. He pointed out: "Under our existing system, cooperative enterprises... are no different from socialist enterprises."
(Ibid.) Since cooperative enterprises are now enterprises that are no different from socialist enterprises, the forms of state capitalism later only had two forms: the concession system and the leasing system. In 1925, there were only 50,000 workers in concession enterprises and 35,000 workers in lease enterprises. State capitalism did not develop much at that time.

III.

State capitalism is a policy stipulated from the perspective of class struggle. In his many documents on state capitalism, Lenin repeatedly emphasized this point. Anyone who ignores this undeniable point cannot understand the essence of state capitalism.

Lenin said: "It is utterly foolish and the most absurd utopianism to think that it is possible to transition from capitalism to socialism without coercive means and without dictatorial means." ("The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime") The so-called "coercive means" and "dictatorial means" are that the proletariat must use its state power to conduct various forms of class struggle with the bourgeoisie in order to transition to socialism, and state capitalism is a form of class struggle under the conditions that the proletariat holds state power.

Lenin pointed out: "The whole question is: Who will defeat whom? If the capitalists can organize themselves first, then they will drive away the communists, and there can be no discussion here. It is necessary to observe these things calmly: Who will defeat whom? Or, the state power of the proletariat shows that it can rely on the peasants to control those capitalist masters, so as to guide capitalism to follow the track of the state and create a kind of capitalism that obeys the state and serves the state." ("The New Economic Policy and the Tasks of the Political Education Department") From Lenin's remarks, we can see that the reason why the proletarian state wants to implement state capitalism is to "create a kind of capitalism that obeys the state and serves the state." Why create such a capitalism? Of course, not for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, but as Lenin said: "It is for the benefit of the working class, and its purpose is to resist and fight against the still powerful bourgeoisie." ("The Strategy of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)") How can we create a kind of capitalism that obeys the proletarian state and serves the proletarian state? Of course, it cannot be imagined that such a capitalism that is contrary to the nature of capitalism can be created without class struggle. Lenin said: "All the habits and traditions of the bourgeoisie, especially the petty bourgeoisie, are also opposed to state supervision, and demand the inviolability of 'sacred private property' and 'sacred' private enterprises." ("The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime") Therefore, "the petty bourgeoisie and private capitalism join hands to oppose both state capitalism and socialism." ("On the Food Tax") Since the spontaneous forces of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie oppose state capitalism, how can we imagine that state capitalism can be implemented without class struggle? Therefore, whether from the purpose of implementing state capitalism or from the means of implementing state capitalism, it cannot but be class struggle. Therefore, Lenin repeatedly emphasized that state capitalism "is the continuation of another form of class struggle, and it is by no means a replacement of class struggle with class peace." (Ibid.)

Lenin's important instruction is not accidental. Because some people often cannot distinguish between class struggle and the forms of class struggle, it seems that only bloody and military struggles count as class struggle, and other forms of struggle are not class struggle, and they do not understand that class struggle is a complex struggle in various forms. Lenin said: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a persistent struggle against the forces and traditions of the old society, bloody and bloodless, forceful and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative." (Quoted from Stalin: "On the Foundations of Leninism") Lenin also talked about "forceful and peaceful" struggles here, but if this "peaceful" is understood as "class peace," then it would be a big mistake. "Class peace" is one thing, and "the form of struggle is peaceful" is another thing. The significance of this form of class struggle cannot be erased just because the form of struggle is peaceful. Similarly, the form of struggle cannot be chosen without considering the need to conduct class struggle. State capitalism is precisely an appropriate form of struggle chosen by the proletariat in order to conduct class struggle under certain historical circumstances.

As we have mentioned earlier: When the Russian bourgeoisie colluded with foreign imperialism to conduct a civil war in the summer of 1918, attempting to overthrow the Soviet regime, the proletarian state adopted the form of class struggle of attacking capital with "Red Guards" against the bourgeoisie. However, when the civil war ended in victory, Lenin wrote: "Does this mean that attacking capital with 'Red Guards' is appropriate at any time, under any circumstances, and that we have no other method of fighting against capital? If we think this way, it is infantile disorder. Although we have won with light cavalry, we also have heavy artillery. Although we have won with suppression methods, we can also win with management methods. When the situation changes, we should be good at changing the methods of fighting against the enemy. We will not refuse for a minute to use the 'Red Guards' method to suppress Mr. Savinkov and Mr. Heger Koli and all other landlord and bourgeois counter-revolutionaries. But we will not be so stupid as to put the means of 'Red Guards' attack in the first place when the era in which 'Red Guards' attack is necessary has basically ended (and ended victoriously), and when the era in which the proletarian state power uses bourgeois experts to cultivate the soil, so that any bourgeoisie can never grow out of this soil, has arrived." ("The Current Tasks of the Soviet Regime") From this, it can be seen that the form of struggle of the proletarian state against the bourgeoisie changes with different circumstances. In one situation, the form of suppression is mainly adopted, and in another situation, the form of management is mainly adopted, but whether the form of suppression or the form of management, the essence is class struggle.

As for the form of struggle of the proletarian state against the bourgeoisie, whether to adopt the form of suppression in certain situations or the form of management in certain situations, this largely depends on the different attitudes of the capitalists towards the proletarian state. In 1918 and 1921, Lenin clearly announced: "At present, we can and should connect two methods: for capitalists who are uncivilized, unwilling to accept any 'state capitalism', unwilling to think of making any compromises, and continuing to disrupt Soviet facilities with speculative actions and buying over the poor, we should take ruthless punishment methods. For capitalists who are civilized, accepting 'state capitalism', able to implement 'state capitalism', and able to be competent and experienced organizers in the largest-scale enterprises (enterprises that can actually supply the needs of millions of people with their own products), and those who are beneficial to the proletariat, we should take compromise or redemption methods." ("On 'Left' Infantile Disorder and Petty-Bourgeois Mentality") Lenin openly and directly talked about what kind of form of struggle the Soviet state at that time would adopt against the bourgeoisie. Do you want to be a civilized capitalist who accepts state capitalism? Or do you want to be an uncivilized capitalist who continues to speculate and disrupt and suffer ruthless punishment? That depends on whether he can take good care of himself.

Since state capitalism is a kind of class struggle, the victory of the proletariat in this struggle depends on the continuous growth of its own class power. What Lenin said at the time: "The effectiveness of this adjustment depends not only on the state power, but even more on the political maturity of the proletariat and the general laboring masses, and also on the level of culture, etc." ("The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions under the New Economic Policy") precisely pointed out the road to victory for the Soviet working class.

   列宁论国家资本主义
   范若愚
   一
   十月革命前后（一九一七年至一九一八年春），列宁就根据马克思关于从资本主义到社会主义需要一个过渡时期的启示，并从当时俄国的实际情况出发，规定了布尔什维克党在过渡时期的政策。列宁当时所规定的重要政策之一，就是在无产阶级掌握国家政权条件下，实行国家资本主义。
    列宁当时认为俄国从资本主义到社会主义，要经过一个社会主义的统计与监督的时期。他说：“如果没有社会主义的核算和监督这个时期，那末就不能接近共产主义的较低阶段。”（“新经济政策与政治教育部的任务”）又说：“什么是苏维埃政权的国家资本主义，在现时实行国家资本主义，就是把资本主义阶级实行过的统计和监督实行起来。”（“关于苏维埃当前任务的报告”）列宁当时所说的要对资本主义实行社会主义的统计与监督，就是要实行无产阶级政权条件下的国家资本主义。在一九一七年九、十月间，列宁曾这样写道：“问题的‘症结’甚至不在于没收资本家的财产，而是在于对资本家及其各种可能的拥护者实行全民的包罗尽致的工人监督。单用没收办法是作不好什么事情的，因为这种办法没包含有组织和统计正确分配的要素。我们以征收公平的捐税（甚至按‘盛加略夫的’税率）来代替没收，这是轻而易举的——不过得要排除任何逃避责任、隐瞒真情、回避法令的可能性。而这种可能性只有工人国家的工人监督才能加以消除。”（“布尔什维克能否保持国家政权？”）从这里可以看到，列宁当时曾设想无产阶级在取得政权之后，并不一定立即全部没收资本主义企业的财产，即不首先实行全部工业国有，而是首先要实行工人监督，对资本主义实行监督的这种办法，就是国家资本主义。
    列宁每逢谈到一九一七年至一九一八年他所提出的国家资本主义政策时，总是指示人们要从小农国家在过渡时期的下列实际情况来了解其必要与可能的。这些实际情况就是：一、各种不同经济成分的存在；二、小生产占居优势；三、无产阶级掌握着国家政权。
    列宁指出：社会主义与资本主义之间的过渡时期的形式，将大大地要随下面一点为转移：占统治地位的是大私产还是小私产，是大农业还是小农业。在资本主义愈不发展的国家里，“小私产”、“小农业”就愈大量地存在着。这个经济成分愈大量地存在，那么过渡到社会主义所需的时间就愈长而困难也愈多。因为要把这种经济成分过渡到社会主义，并不像要把资本主义“大私产”“大农业”过渡到社会主义那么容易，那么简单。因此，列宁说：
    “为了使资本主义前期关系过渡到社会主义，究竟需要哪些间接的道路、方法、手段和补助办法。全部关键就在这里。”（“论粮食税”）
    列宁分析苏联在过渡初期的经济状况时，曾指出有宗法式的，即颇大程度是原始式的经济，小商品生产（其中包括有大多数出卖粮食的农民），私人资本主义，国家资本主义和社会主义等五种不同社会经济结构的成分。在这五种不同经济成分中，当时显然是小资产阶级自发势力占优势。在这种情况下，无产阶级取得政权，把资本主义企业没收变为社会主义经济成分，可是资本主义也并不因此而彻底消灭，它在某种程度上依然是不可避免的。因为资本主义乃是小商品经济生产和交换的自发产物，只要有大量的小生产存在，就不可避免地要产生资本主义，而无产阶级政权对于自发地产生资本主义的小生产者，却是不能没收和驱逐的。因此，在过渡时期，资本主义的经济成分，在某种程度上、某种期限内依然是不可避免地存在着。列宁指出：
    “那末，‘过渡’这字又是什么意思呢？它在经济上是不是说，在这制度中既有资本主义的，也有社会主义的成分、部分或因素呢？谁都承认，是这样的。”（同上）
    资本主义经济成分，既然在过渡时期也是不可避免地存在着，那么，掌握国家政权的无产阶级对它究应采取一种什么样的政策呢？是完全禁止、封闭资本主义的发生和发展呢？是任资本主义自由泛滥呢？还是采取正当的方法对资本主义加以利用与限制，并最后保证把它变为社会主义呢？领导国家的无产阶级及其政党，就不能不在此三者之中有所抉择了。
    曾有人认为资本主义是祸害，社会主义是福利，因而就主张在过渡时期对于不可避免的资本主义应予以迎头痛击，立即完全禁止和封闭其发展。列宁认为这种想法就是忘记了过渡时期现存社会经济结构的全部总和。须知在过渡时期，除了资本主义与社会主义两种经济成分外，还有其它的经济成分，特别是大量的小生产存在。列宁指出：“资本主义，若与社会主义比较，确是祸害。但与中世纪制，与小生产，与联系着小生产者散漫性的官僚主义比较，资本主义便是福利。”（同上）因此，列宁又指出，一个政党如果对于在有千百万小生产者存在条件下所必然发生的资本主义的一切发展，企图试行一种完全禁止或封闭的政策，“就不仅是愚蠢，而且是自杀。其所以是愚蠢，因为这种政策在经济上是行不通的；其所以是自杀，因为试行这类政策的党，就必然会遭到破产。”（同上）
    也曾有人认为资本主义既然是不可避免的，就
  “听其自然”地让它自由发展去吧，因而就主张对资本主义的发展不加限制，不加管理，不加监督。列宁指出，这也是十分错误的。他说：“许多经济问题上的错误都是由于不了解这一事实才发生的。投机者，奸商，垄断破坏者——这便是我国‘内部’主要的敌人，即苏维埃政权在经济设施方面的敌人。……我们很清楚地知道，投机业的经济基础，乃是在俄国蔓延得非常广泛的小私有者阶层，以及在每一个小资产者那里都有自己的代办的私人资本主义。”（同上）
    由此可知，无产阶级掌握政权的国家，在过渡时期对于某种程度上不可避免的资本主义成分，是既不能立即完全禁止或封闭其发展，也不能任其无限制地自由泛滥。那么，唯一合理而可能的政策究竟是什么呢？这就是国家资本主义。列宁指出：
    “全部问题——无论理论上或实践上的问题——就是要找到正当的方法，应该怎样把资本主义之不可避免的（在某种程度内和某种限期内是不可避免的）发展，引导到国家资本主义轨道上去，这必须赖有一些什么条件，怎样保证在不远将来变国家资本主义为社会主义。”（同上）
    “既然我们还无力实现由小生产直接过渡到社会主义，所以资本主义——它是小生产与交换的自发产物——在某种范围内便不可避免，所以我们也就应当把资本主义作为小生产与社会主义间的中间环节，作为提高生产力的手段，途径，方法和方式来利用（特别是要把它引导到国家资本主义的轨道上去）。”（同上）
    读了以上两段引文，就可以知道，在过渡期间的一定时期以内和一定范围以内实行国家资本主义，其目的就在于要把小生产占优势条件下不可避免的资本主义，作为提高生产力的一种手段和方法而加以利用，并逐渐把它变为社会主义。因此，列宁又指出，国家资本主义“是我们能够容许和应当容许的一种资本主义”。
    可是，也还有人这样担心：国家资本主义虽然是应当容许的一种资本主义，但容许资本主义终究是危险的。为此，列宁又一再地给以解释：“谁是国家资本主义企业的组织者，谁就可以把它变为自己的助手”（“关于苏维埃当前任务的报告”）。因为在资本主义政权条件下的国家资本主义和无产阶级政权条件下的国家资本主义，这是两个不同的概念。资本主义国家里的国家资本主义，是拥护资产阶级利益反对无产阶级的；而无产阶级国家里的国家资本主义，则是为着工人阶级的利益，其目的在于抵抗资产阶级并与之作斗争的。列宁说：“我们人不愿来了解，当我们说到‘国家’时，这国家就是我们，就是无产阶级，就是工人阶级的先锋队。国家资本主义，这就是我们能够加以限制，我们能够规定它的界限的一种资本主义”。（“俄国共产党（布）第十一次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告”）
    总之：在无产阶级掌握政权的国家里所实行的国家资本主义政策，乃是为了工人阶级的利益，把不可避免的资本主义作为提高生产力的手段和方法而加以利用的政策，是为了反对资产阶级投机与无政府状态的生产而加以限制的政策，是为了克服小生产自发势力以便过渡到社会主义的政策。列宁指出：“须知这完全是历史上空前未有的情况：无产阶级即革命先锋队拥有极充分的政权，同时却有国家资本主义并存着。问题的关键就在于要使我们了解，这便是我们能够容许和应当容许的一种资本主义，是我们能够限制和应当限制的一种资本主义”。（同上）
    由于上述原因，苏维埃政权在其成立的头几天，就颁布了列宁所起草的“工人监督条例”。在这个条例中，对资本主义企业，只规定“施行由工人监督一切产品和原料之生产、保存和买卖事宜的办法”。（“关于工人监督条例草案”）后来，列宁在另一篇文章中回忆道：“在一九一七年末所颁布的最初的法令之一，就是国家对于广告事业的独占的法令。这个法令包含着什么样的意味呢？它含有这样的意思，即：取得了国家政权的无产阶级，预定尽可能更逐渐地过渡到新的社会经济关系上去——不是废止私人的报纸，而是使它从属于一定的国家领导，将它引导到国家资本主义的常轨上来。因之，那规定国家对于广告事业独占的法令，曾假定，私人企业性的报纸，作为一般现象，依旧存在下去，需要私人广告事业的经济政策，也将继续下去，私有财产制度也继续存在下去，需要广告及广告事业的一整列的私人企业，都继续存在。关于私人广告事业独占制的法令，其意思，就是这样，而且也只能是这样。关于银行事业的法令中，也有与这相似的情形。”（“论新经济政策”）从这里我们也可以看到，在十月革命后的最初时日，即在一九一七年末至一九一八年春间，列宁也还是设想暂不没收全部资本主义企业，而是要把资本主义引导向国家资本主义，尽可能用逐渐的、和缓的、谨慎的办法来完成向社会主义过渡。
    可是，当时阶级斗争的发展，使上述一类属于国家资本主义措施的法令未能见诸实行。因为俄国的资产阶级一开始就用怠工来回答苏维埃政权的这些法令。首先出现的，就是反革命的银行官员的怠工事件。于是，在一九一七年十二月，苏维埃政权就颁布了银行国有化的法令，用以消灭这一怠工事件。此后，资产阶级仍继续以怠工、关厂直至发动国内战争来反抗苏维埃政权，于是，无产阶级的国家也就以一系列的法令，宣布没收资产阶级的生产工具和生产资料。
    最初，即一九一八年春，苏维埃政权曾想用工人监督的办法，把资本主义引导到国家资本主义的轨道上来。可是，当时俄国的资产阶级所梦想的，却是要根本推翻苏维埃政权，当然谈不到什么服从无产阶级国家的法令和接受工人的监督了。这种情况，正如列宁所说的：“敌人，即资本家阶级，是以完全否定整个国家政权的行动，来回答国家政权的这条法令。（即指关于广告事业一类的法令——引用者）根本就谈不到任何广告事业了，因为在我们制度中所留下的资产阶级资本主义的一切，那时都是把它的一切力量集中于为国家政权之基础本身而斗争了。我们曾经向资本家们建议：‘服从国家的调节吧，服从国家的政权吧，这样，就可以不必完全废除适合于人民的旧利益、习惯与观点的那种条件，而可以得到用国家调节的办法来逐渐的改变这一切’，但是，人家却给我们提出了关于我们自身生存的问题。资本家阶级所采取的策略，就在于推动我们来作你死我活的和无情的斗争，这种斗争迫使我们对旧关系之破坏，要比我们在最初所预定的无比之大。”（同上）列宁这一段话，十分清楚地说明了十月革命后国家资本主义为什么没有见诸实行。原来，无产阶级向资本家“建议”，要他们服从无产阶级的国家政权，要他们走国家资本主义的道路，这样，就可以逐渐改变资本主义关系而向社会主义过渡。可是，资产阶级拒绝了这条道路，他们要保持资本主义关系，并推动无产阶级来作你死我活的无情斗争。当时俄国资产阶级之所以敢于公然反抗无产阶级的国家政权，也正如列宁所说的：“因为资产阶级在这一方面不用直接搏斗的方法来考验一下自己的力量，怎样能突然地服从这个崭新的、空前未有的无产阶级的政权呢？”（同上）既然资产阶级要和当时世界上唯一的而且是初诞生的无产阶级国家政权直接搏斗以考验一下自己的力量，那么，无产阶级也就不得不给以有力的回击，就不得不把资本主义企业没收以摧毁资产阶级的经济基础。这一场直接搏斗的结局，证明了资产阶级已没有力量把资本主义关系保存下去，恰恰相反，对资本主义关系的破坏，是比无产阶级原来所预定的还要无比之大。这就是苏联在一九一八年国家资本主义未见诸实行，而不得不“用赤卫队攻击资本”的原因。
    十月革命后阶级斗争的发展，虽然使国家资本主义政策当时没有见诸实行而不得不“用赤卫队攻击资本”，但这并不能证明：在一定的历史条件下把资本主义引导到国家资本主义，从而逐渐地过渡到社会主义这一政策是错的。关于此点，列宁后来曾加以评论道：“自然，现在在从此后历史发展的前途上来评价事件时，我们不能不认为，我们的这个法令（即指前引关于广告事业的法令——引用者）乃是过于天真的，而且在某种程度上说来是错误的，但是同时，这个法令里面也包含有正确的东西，那就是国家政权——无产阶级——曾经企图实行过渡到新的社会关系上去，并且尽可能逐渐地和尽可能没有特殊破坏地、尽量适应于当时既存的关系。”（同上）这也就是说，尽管事件的发展和原来所设想的有所不同，但不能因此就否认了过渡的必要，也不能因此就认为过渡是无需逐渐地、稳步地而可以不顾一切特殊破坏、不顾当时既存关系去进行。
    二
    在国内战争时期，为了击败外国帝国主义的武装干涉，为了扑灭国内地主资产阶级的反革命叛乱，苏联不得不采取了战时共产主义政策。当国内战争胜利结束后，苏联由战时共产主义政策转变为新经济政策，列宁总结当时的经验说：“到一九二一年春天已经弄明白：我们在想用‘袭击’方式，即最缩短、最迅速、最直接的方式过渡到社会主义生产与分配原则的企图上，曾经遭受到了失败。一九二一年春季的政治形势，曾向我们指出，在许多经济问题上，退却到国家资本主义阵地去，由‘袭击’改为‘围攻’，乃是不可避免的。”（同上）特别是在当时经济遭到严重破坏的情况下，为了恢复工业，为了改善工农生活，仍有实行国家资本主义的必要。不过，在一九二一年春以来所实行的国家资本主义，其具体形式已和一九一八年春所设想的国家资本主义不同了。一九一八年春所设想的国家资本主义，正如上面我们已经谈过的，是不先实行没收全部资本主义企业，而用国家监督的办法把尚未没收的资本主义企业引导到国家资本主义轨道上去；而一九二一年所实行的国家资本主义，则是把已经没收为国有的一部分企业，以租让、租借等形式“退却”到国家资本主义轨道上去。但这只是国家资本主义在不同历史情况下的不同做法。至于在无产阶级掌握政权条件下的国家资本主义的意义，无论在一九一八年春季和一九二一年春季，在列宁的著作中，都同样着重地反对小资产阶级自发势力——本时期内
  “主要的敌人”，都同样地否认在本时期内能直接过渡到社会主义，并同样着重指出应采取一些经济建设的过渡办法，局部地施行国家资本主义作为反对资产阶级和小资产阶级自发势力的工具，并作为比不受这种国家节制的私人资本主义更高的，比小生产更高的经济形式。
    在一九二一年以后，苏联曾一度实行过的国家资本主义，主要有两种形式，即租让制和租借制。这两种形式的国家资本主义，都是社会主义经济和资本主义经济的外部合作，在国家资本主义企业内部并没有社会主义经济的成分。例如租让制，列宁指出：“苏维埃制度下的租让制是什么呢？这就是苏维埃政权，即无产阶级国家政权为了反对小私有者的（宗法式的、小资产阶级的）自发势力，而与国家资本主义结成的一种合同，同盟或联盟。承租人，这就是资本家。他们按资本主义方式经营业务，是为要获得利润，他们与无产阶级政权订立合同，是为要获得高于普通利润的额外利润，或者说，是为要获得用别的方法所不能得到或极难得到的原料。苏维埃政权所获得的利益，便是发展生产力，便是立刻或在极短期内，增加生产品量。”（“论粮食税”）资本家从国家手中所租的企业，其所有权当然是国家的，租让的契约也必须是首先以有利于国家为原则的，但这只是资本主义与无产阶级国家的外部关系。至于这些企业的内部，在契约所规定的年限内，则是由资本家按照资本主义方式经营的，而资本家所获得的利润也是高于普通利润的额外利润。因此，列宁说：“人人都从事管理吧！资本家将和你们并列工作，……他们将会从你们这里敲取百分之好几百的利润，他们将在我们近旁发财致富。让他们去发财吧，但你们要向他们那里学会管理经营”。（“新经济政策与政治教育部的任务”）关于租借制，列宁指出：它是“国家把国有的某种场所或产区，林地，土地等租予企业资本家，而且租借合同与租让合同极相类似。”（“论粮食税”）
    前面已经叙述到，在一九二一年时，由于苏联社会主义工业还不发达，还无法满足农民需要大量商品的要求，因而列宁认为施行国家资本主义是最妥善的办法，因为经过国家资本主义的办法，就可以建立苏维埃政权与农村间的联络，即与广大小生产者的联络，所以列宁曾设想国家资本主义可能成为当时苏联经济中的基本形式。在这种设想下，列宁当时曾把合作制也拿来和国家资本主义配合观察，这在一九二一年的具体历史情况下来说，无疑是正确的。可是，也就从一九二一年起，苏联情形起了重大的变化，在以后不久时期内，苏联社会主义工业和国营商业以及合作社商业，已经成了占优势的力量，广大的小生产者已经和社会主义工业结合起来，苏维埃国家已经能够用自己的力量来建立城乡间的联络，即建立社会主义工业与广大小生产者的联络了。而这时候的合作制已经是和社会主义工业配合着，因此，还在一九二三年，列宁就不再把合作制和国家资本主义配合观察了，而是用另外一种看法去观察合作制。他指出：“在我们的现存制度下，合作社企业……与社会主义企业没有区别”。
  （“论合作制”）合作社企业这时既已是与社会主义企业没有区别的企业，因此，到了后来，国家资本主义的形式，只有租让制和租借制两种了。一九二五年，在租让制企业中只有五万工人，在租借企业中只有三万五千工人。国家资本主义在当时并未得多大的发展。
    三
    国家资本主义，是从阶级斗争的观点出发而规定的政策。列宁在其论证国家资本主义的许多文献中，都一再强调地阐述了这一观点。谁要忽略了这一不容忽略的观点，谁就不可能了解国家资本主义的实质。
    列宁说：“如果认为不用强迫手段，不用专政手段，便可以由资本主义过渡到社会主义，那就是绝顶愚蠢和最荒唐的空想主义。”（“苏维埃政权的当前任务”）所谓“强迫手段”“专政手段”，就是无产阶级为了过渡到社会主义要运用自己的国家政权和资产阶级进行各种形式的阶级斗争，而国家资本主义，正是无产阶级在掌握国家政权条件下的一种阶级斗争形式。
    列宁指出：“整个的问题乃是：谁将战胜谁？如果资本家能够首先组织起来，那时他们就要赶走共产党人，这里再不能有任何讨论了。必须冷静地来观察这些事情：谁将战胜谁？或者是，无产阶级的国家政权，表明能够依靠农民，控制那些资本家老爷们，以便引导资本主义循着国家的轨道来进行，并创造出一种服从国家和为国家而服务的资本主义”。（“新经济政策与政治教育部的任务”）从列宁这一段话里，我们可以看到：无产阶级国家所以要实行国家资本主义，乃是要“创造出一种服从国家和为国家而服务的资本主义”，为什么要创造这样一种资本主义呢？当然不是为了资产阶级的利益，而正如列宁所说：“是为着工人阶级的利益，目的在抵抗依然强大的资产阶级，并与之斗争。”（“俄国共产党（布尔什维克）的策略”）怎样才能创造出一种服从无产阶级国家和为无产阶级国家服务的资本主义来呢？当然不能设想，不经过阶级斗争，就会创造出这样一种与资本主义本性相反的资本主义来。列宁说：“资产阶级尤其是小资产阶级的一切习惯与传统，也是反对国家监督，而要求‘神圣私有财产制’和‘神圣’私有企业的不可侵犯性。”（“苏维埃政权的当前任务”）因此，“小资产阶级和私人资本主义共同携手，既反对国家资本主义，又反对社会主义。”（“论粮食税”）资产阶级和小资产阶级自发势力既然反对国家资本主义，又怎么能设想不经过阶级斗争而能实行国家资本主义呢？因此，无论从实行国家资本主义的目的来说，或者从实行国家资本主义的手段来说，都不能不是阶级斗争。所以列宁曾一再强调指出，国家资本主义“是阶级斗争另一形式的继续，而决不是用阶级和平来代替阶级斗争。”（同上）
    列宁这一重要指示，并不是偶然的。因为有些人往往不能把阶级斗争和阶级斗争的形式分清，似乎认为只有流血的、军事的斗争，才算阶级斗争，其它形式的斗争就不是阶级斗争，而不了解阶级斗争乃是多种形式的复杂斗争。列宁说：“无产阶级专政是为反对旧社会势力及其传统而进行的坚持的斗争，流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争”。（转引自斯大林：“论列宁主义基础”）列宁在这里也讲到“强力的与和平的”斗争，可是如果把这个“和平”了解为“阶级和平”，那就大错特错了。“阶级和平”是一回事，“斗争的形式是和平的”这又是一回事。不能因为斗争的形式是和平的，因而就抹煞了这种形式的阶级斗争意义，同样，也不能因为必须进行阶级斗争，因而就可以不选择斗争的形式。国家资本主义，正是无产阶级为了进行阶级斗争，在一定的历史情况下所选择的一种恰当的斗争形式。
    前面我们已经叙述过：当一九一八年夏，俄国资产阶级勾结外国帝国主义进行国内战争，企图推翻苏维埃政权的时候，无产阶级国家对资产阶级就采取了用“赤卫队”攻击资本的阶级斗争形式。可是，当国内战争胜利结束后，列宁就写道：“这是不是说用‘赤卫队’攻击资本在任何时候都是适当的，在任何情势之下都是适当的，此外我们再没有别种同资本作斗争的方法呢？如果这样设想，那就是幼稚病。我们虽用轻骑队获得了胜利，可是我们也有重炮队。我们虽用镇压方法获得了胜利，可是我们也能够用管理方法来取得胜利。当情势改变的时候，应该善于改变反对敌人的斗争方法。我们连一分钟都不会拒绝用‘赤卫队’方式去镇压沙温可夫辈和黑格启科利辈先生们以及其他一切地主和资产阶级的反革命派。可是我们并不会如此蠢笨，竟在须用‘赤卫队’攻击的时代大体已告结束（而且胜利地结束了）的时候，在由无产阶级国家政权利用资产阶级专门家来精耕土壤，使这土壤上绝不能再生长出任何资产阶级来的这种时代已经到临的时候，还将‘赤卫队’的攻击手段摆在首要地位。”（“苏维埃政权的当前任务”）由此可见，无产阶级国家对于资产阶级的斗争形式，是随着不同的情况而改变的。在某一情况下就主要采取镇压的形式，在另一情况下就主要采取管理的形式，但无论镇压的形式，或者管理的形式，其实质则都是阶级斗争。
    至于无产阶级国家对于资产阶级的斗争形式，究竟在何种情况下采取镇压的形式，在何种情况下采取管理的形式，这在颇大程度上，是以资本家对无产阶级国家的不同态度为转移的。在一九一八年和一九二一年，列宁都明白地宣告过：“现时我们能够，而且应该联贯两种方法：对于不文明的、不愿接受任何‘国家资本主义’、不想到作任何妥协、而继续以投机行动和收买贫民等行动来破坏苏维埃设施的资本家，应采取无情惩治的办法，对于文明的、接受‘国家资本主义’的、能实行‘国家资本主义’的、能充当最大规模企业（实际上能以自己的生产品供给千百万人之需要的企业）中能干的和有经验的组织者而对于无产阶级有益的那种资本家，却应采取妥协或赎买的办法。”（“论‘左’倾幼稚病和小资产阶级性”）关于苏维埃国家当时对于资产阶级究竟采取何种形式的斗争，列宁就是这样公开地、直截了当地讲了的。要做一个接受国家资本主义的文明的资本家呢？还是要做一个继续投机破坏而遭受无情惩治的不文明的资本家呢？那就要看他能否善以自处了。
    国家资本主义既然是一种阶级斗争，那么，无产阶级要在这个斗争中取得胜利，就取决于自己阶级力量的不断增长了。列宁当时所说的话：“此种调剂的功效，不仅有赖于国家政权，而且更加有赖于无产阶级和一般劳动群众政治上的成熟程度，再则有赖于文化水准等等。”（“新经济政策下职工会的作用与任务”）正是给苏联工人阶级指出了走向胜利的道路。
