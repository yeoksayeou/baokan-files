Sichuan Province Has Overfulfilled Rapeseed Procurement Plan

Since April, the farmers of Sichuan Province have been selling large quantities of rapeseed to the state. As of early June, the province's rapeseed procurement plan has been overfulfilled, and many farmers are still continuing to sell. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various localities have played a leading role in selling rapeseed. In Xindu County, three agricultural production cooperatives and eight hundred and fifteen mutual aid teams signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives in April to pre-sell rapeseed to the state. Five agricultural production cooperatives in Mianzhu County sold more than 80,000 jin of rapeseed to the state. After selling rapeseed, farmers in various localities invested large amounts of funds in production. The Hu Guangsong mutual aid team in Niupi Township, Chongqing County, sold 2,300 jin of rapeseed to the state, and then bought back twelve seedling rakes, 1,000 jin of oil cake, and a batch of manure buckets and other means of production from the supply and marketing cooperative. Farmers in Jintang County bought 1.27 million jin of fertilizer from the supply and marketing cooperative within a month of starting to sell rapeseed. At present, oil pressing workers in various places are actively pressing rapeseed oil. The Sichuan Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Company has begun to transport a batch of new rapeseed oil to Chongqing, Shanghai and other places. (Wu Zhichen et al.)

    四川省收购菜籽计划已经超额完成
    四川省农民从四月份以来，把大批菜籽卖给国家。截至六月初，全省收购菜籽的计划已经超额完成，许多农民还在继续出售。各地农业生产合作社和互助组在出售菜籽时起了带头作用。新都县三个农业生产合作社和八百一十五个互助组在四月间和供销合作社签订合同，把菜籽预售给国家。绵竹县五个农业生产合作社就卖给国家八万多斤菜籽。各地农民卖出菜籽以后，把大批资金投入生产。崇庆县牛皮乡胡光松互助组卖给国家二千三百斤菜籽，接着从供销合作社买回十二把秧耙、一千斤油枯和一批粪桶等生产资料。金堂县农民在开始卖菜籽以来的一个月内，从供销合作社买的肥料有一百二十七万斤。目前，各地榨油工人正在积极榨制菜油。中国油脂公司四川省公司已开始把一批新菜油运到重庆、上海等地。（吴之琛等）
