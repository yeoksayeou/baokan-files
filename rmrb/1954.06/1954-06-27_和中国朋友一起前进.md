    Advancing Together with Chinese Friends
    Li Zhongxie, Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Republic Labor Hero
    During my visit to various parts of China, I saw many things that moved me. In particular, the great creative labor shown by the Chinese worker brothers in order to build their own motherland and to support the reconstruction of the Korean people left me with an indelible impression. In the factories I visited, I could see slogans like "Learn from Wang Chonglun" posted in front of the machines operated by the workers, and they were working hard. The movement for technical innovation in production has been widely carried out. At the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, we met Comrade Zhu Shunyu, a labor model, who created 24 new tools in two years, increasing work efficiency by 18 times. He said, "In order not to feel ashamed in front of the Party and the people of the motherland, I have to work a hundred times harder."
    This is not just Zhu Shunyu's idea alone, but the common idea of ​​thousands upon thousands of Chinese workers who are working selflessly.
    The creative labor of the Chinese worker brothers has achieved great achievements, which not only accelerates the process of China's socialist industrialization, but their lives have also gradually improved with the development of production. Magnificent workers' cultural palaces can be seen everywhere. The beautiful Summer Palace and West Lake have also become places for worker brothers to rest and recuperate.
    The enthusiasm of the Chinese worker brothers in supporting the Korean anti-aggression war and supporting Korean reconstruction also moved me very much. After the armistice, they manufactured many freight cars, passenger cars, ships, and machinery and transported them to Korea. Some even went directly to Korea to participate in construction. During a visit to the Shanghai Textile Machinery Factory, I met Comrade Yang Yuanbao, who is known as the "glorious father." When we went to see him, this old worker in his fifties was standing in front of a lathe, enthusiastically cutting steel bars. In the past, his son worked on this machine. Later, his son joined the Volunteer Army. From then on, the old man took over his son's work. On the first day the old man stood in front of the machine, he wrote to his son, saying: Although I am old, I will not fall behind you. I will definitely strive to be a model. I hope you will kill more enemies and strive for meritorious service in Korea. Later, the father did fulfill his promise and became a model, and the son also made meritorious service and won two Korean military medals.
    When I saw these respectable and lovely Chinese worker brothers, when I heard these touching stories, my heart was surging with infinite excitement and gratitude. At the same time, a firm conviction arose: with such reliable friends advancing with us, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. I will definitely bring the valuable experience of the Chinese worker friends back to my country and apply it to my work. At the same time, I will also convey this experience and friendship to the Korean workers and encourage them to accelerate the recovery and construction of the motherland under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung.

### 和中国朋友一起前进

    和中国朋友一起前进
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员  共和国劳动英雄  李锺燮
    在中国各地访问中，我看到很多使我感动的事，尤其是中国工人兄弟为了建设自己的祖国，为了支援朝鲜人民的恢复建设，表现的那种伟大的创造性劳动，给我留下了永远不可磨灭的印象。在我访问过的工厂里，几乎到处都可以看到在工人们操作的机器前面贴着“向王崇伦学习”的标语，紧张地劳动着。生产技术革新运动已经普遍开展。在上海的汽轮机厂里我们和劳动模范朱顺余会见了，他在两年中创造了二十四种新工具。提高工作效率达十八倍。他说：“为了在党和祖国人民面前不觉惭愧，我不能不百倍地努力工作。”
    这不是朱顺余一个人的想法，而是正在忘我劳动的中国千千万万工人们共同的想法。
    中国工人兄弟的创造性劳动，已经得到了巨大的成就，不但加速着中国社会主义工业化的进程，他们的生活也随着生产的发展逐渐改善了。到处可以看到华丽的工人文化宫。风景幽美的颐和园和西湖也成了工人兄弟休息和疗养的地方。
    中国工人兄弟支援朝鲜的反侵略战争，支援朝鲜重建的热情也是使我非常感动的。停战以后，他们制造了很多货车、客车、船舶和机械运到了朝鲜，有的还直接到朝鲜去参加了建设。在访问上海纺织机械制造厂时，我会见了被人们称为“光荣的父亲”的杨元宝同志，我们去看他时，这位五十多岁的老工人，正站在旋盘机前，热心地削着钢棒。过去，他的儿子在这架机器前工作，以后他的儿子参加了志愿军，从那时起，这位老人就代替了儿子的工作，老人站在机器前的第一天，就给儿子写信说：我虽然年纪大了，但也不会落在你的后边，我一定争取当模范，希望你也要在朝鲜多杀敌人，争取立功。以后父亲果然实现了诺言，当了模范，儿子也立了功，获得了两枚朝鲜的军功章。
    当我看到这些可敬可爱的中国工人兄弟时，当我听到这些动人的故事时，我的心里汹涌着无限的兴奋和感激。同时产生了一种坚定的信念：有如此可靠的朋友和我们一起前进，是没有克服不了的困难的。我一定要把中国工人朋友们的宝贵经验带回祖国，应用到我的工作上。同时也把这经验和友情传达给朝鲜工人们，鼓舞他们在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下，加速祖国的恢复和建设事业。
