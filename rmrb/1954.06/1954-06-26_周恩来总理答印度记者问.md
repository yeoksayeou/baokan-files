Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai's response to questions raised by Mr. Shelvankar, a reporter from the Indian newspaper "The Hindu."

June 22, 1954.

Question: Is Premier Zhou satisfied with the progress made at the Geneva Conference? What does he consider to be the main obstacle to the complete success of the conference? What are his views on the future of the Geneva Conference?

Answer: The Geneva Conference, which has lasted for eight weeks, has made some progress. However, in the discussions on the Korean question, the U.S. delegation mainly refused to consider all reasonable proposals. Even on the last day, they rejected the Chinese delegation's proposal that participating countries express their continued willingness to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This prevented any agreement on the Korean question. Nevertheless, the Korean question has not been removed from the agenda. The Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification, national independence, and democratic freedom must be satisfied. Regarding the Indochina issue, progress at the conference has been slow. However, the two agreements reached by the conference have paved the way for resolving the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. We hope that in the next three weeks, the belligerent parties in Indochina will sincerely negotiate to reach a glorious armistice agreement on fair and reasonable terms acceptable to all parties. The responsibility of other participating countries should be to promote and support, rather than obstruct and undermine, the achievement of an armistice agreement between the two sides. At the same time, we must be vigilant against certain forces inside and outside the conference attempting to internationalize the Indochina war, a conspiracy opposed by the Colombo Conference.

Question: Is it fair to say that the people of Asian countries have certain common major problems? How does Premier Zhou think the people of Asian countries can help each other to solve these problems?

Answer: The aggressive policy of dividing Asian countries into mutually hostile military blocs is increasingly threatening the peace and security of Asian countries. This is the main problem facing the people of Asian countries today. We believe that in order to safeguard peace in Asia, and to protect the national independence and autonomy of the people of Asian countries, Asian countries should consult with each other and work together, by assuming corresponding obligations, to maintain peace and security in Asia.

Question: Does the Chinese government believe that the relations between China and India, two great neighbors, are developing satisfactorily? Can Premier Zhou suggest some new ways to further develop the relations between the two countries and to make the joint cooperation between the two countries beneficial to world peace and welfare?

Answer: The Chinese people are very happy to have India as a peace-loving neighbor. Recently, China and India, based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, signed an agreement on trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India after full consultation. This agreement not only strengthens

    周恩来总理答印度记者问
      【新华社日内瓦二十五日电】周恩来总理对印度“印度教徒报”记者雪尔凡伽所提问题的答复。
    一九五四年六月二十二日。
    问：周总理对于日内瓦会议取得的进展是否满意？认为阻挠会议完全成功的主要障碍是什么？对于日内瓦会议的前途有什么看法？
    答：八周以来的日内瓦会议是取得了一些进展的。但是，在朝鲜问题的讨论中，主要是美国代表团拒绝考虑一切的合理建议，甚而在最后一天，对于中国代表团所提出的要求与会各国表示继续努力获致和平解决朝鲜问题的协议的共同愿望的建议，也都加以拒绝。这就使关于朝鲜问题的讨论没有达成任何协议。虽然如此，朝鲜问题并没有从日程上抹掉。朝鲜人民要求和平统一、民族独立和民主自由的愿望是必须予以满足的。在印度支那的问题上，会议的进展是迟缓的。但是，会议所达成的两项协议已经替恢复印度支那和平问题的解决开辟了道路。我们希望在最近的三周内，印度支那交战的双方应该真诚协商，以求在各方面都能接受的公平合理的条件的基础上，达成光荣的停战协议，而与会的其他各国的责任，应该是推动和支持，而不是阻挠和破坏双方停战协议的达成。同时，我们对于会内、会外某种势力企图使印度支那战争国际化的阴谋，不能不提高警惕，而这种阴谋正是科伦坡会议所反对的。
    问：是不是可以说亚洲各国人民都有某些共同的主要问题？周总理认为亚洲各国人民如何能相互帮助来解决这些问题？
    答：把亚洲国家分裂成为互相敌对的军事集团的侵略政策正日益威胁着亚洲各国的和平和安全。这是亚洲各国人民当前面对着的主要问题。我们认为，为了保障亚洲的和平，为了维护亚洲各国人民的民族独立和自主权利，亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应义务的方法，共同努力，来维护亚洲的和平和安全。
    问：中国政府是否认为中印两个伟大邻邦之间的关系正在满意地发展？周总理是否能建议一些新的方法使两国的关系得以进一步的发展，两国之间的共同合作得以有利于世界的和平和福利？
    答：中国人民很高兴有印度这样致力于和平的邻邦。最近中印两国基于互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则，经过充分的协商而签订了关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定。这个协定不仅加强了中印两个伟大国家之间的关系，还给亚洲各国之间的合作提供了良好的范例。我们深信，在这样新的基础上，中印两国在国际事业中的合作必将进一步的发展，中印两国人民间的友谊也将日益加深。这对于巩固亚洲及世界的和平有着重大的意义。
    问：请周总理谈一下你对甘地的生活和工作的看法。
    答：中国人民对于甘地为争取民族独立的长期奋斗生活是表示敬意的，这种奋斗生活在印度人民中有着深刻的影响。
