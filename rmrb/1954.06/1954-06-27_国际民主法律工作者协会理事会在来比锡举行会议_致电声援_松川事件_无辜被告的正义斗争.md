Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 24th: The Council of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, at its recent meeting in Leipzig, passed a cable addressed to the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The cable stated: We believe that you innocent workers have been subjected to unwarranted accusations by international fascism, and we believe that you should be released. Our belief in this is further strengthened after studying the Dimitrov case in Leipzig—he was previously falsely accused by the Leipzig court of arson in the Reichstag.

We recognize and commend the wisdom and courage you have shown in the struggle to uphold justice, freedom, and peace, and to oppose fascism and provocative forces.

The same meeting passed a cable addressed to the Supreme Court of Japan, stating: "The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers urges you to pay attention to the absolute importance of making a fair and objective judgment in the 'Matsukawa Incident'.

We, legal professionals from many countries around the world, representing hundreds of thousands of other legal professionals, are watching the development of this case with great concern. Because in our view, there is no evidence against the defendants other than confessions obtained by force or violence.

We condemn attempts to convict based on such evidence, and we believe this is the same as the actions taken under fascist rule."

    国际民主法律工作者协会理事会在来比锡举行会议
    致电声援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】国际民主法律工作者协会理事会在最近在来比锡举行的会议上通过了致“松川事件”被告的电报，电报说：我们相信你们这些无辜的工人是受到了国际法西斯主义的莫须有的控告，我们认为你们应该得到释放。我们在来比锡对季米特洛夫案件——他从前被来比锡法庭莫须有地控以在国会纵火的罪名——加以研究后，在这一点上的信念更巩固了。
    我们认识到并赞扬你们在维护正义、自由与和平，反对法西斯主义和挑衅的势力的斗争中所表现的智慧和勇敢。
    同一会议上通过致日本最高裁判所的电报说：“国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议要求你们注意在‘松川事件’中作严正和客观的裁判的绝对重要性。
    我们，来自世界上许多国家的法律工作者、代表着其他成千成万的法律工作者，正极为关切地注视着这一案件的发展。因为在我们看来，除了用强力或暴力取得的供词以外，没有不利于被告的证据。
    我们谴责企图根据这种证据判罪的行为，我们认为这和在法西斯统治下采取的行动如出一辙。”
