    要求立即召开安理会会议审查危地马拉问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：苏联常驻联合国副代表谢·克·查拉普金在六月二十四日交给联合国秘书长转给安全理事会主席洛奇的一封信。信件内容如下：
    “六月二十三日晚，我接到危地马拉驻联合国代表的一封电报，电报通知我，危地马拉政府要求安全理事会召开紧急会议，因为其他联合国会员国违反联合国宪章第二十五条，仍然没有实行安全理事会在六月二十日所通过的决议。电报也说到危地马拉已有几十个城市和村庄受到飞机轰炸和扫射。
    危地马拉代表要求安全理事会在今天（六月二十四日）开会，以采取措施，制止侵略。
    由于以上所述，我要求您、主席先生立刻召开安全理事会会议，以审查危地马拉的问题。”
