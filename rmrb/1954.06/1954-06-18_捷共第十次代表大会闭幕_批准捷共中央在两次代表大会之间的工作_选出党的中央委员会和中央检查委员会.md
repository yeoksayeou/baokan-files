Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 16th: The 10th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party continued its sessions on the 14th and 15th and closed on the 15th.

The delegates' discussion of the reports made by Novotný, Štrougal, and Široký on the second, third, and fourth items on the agenda concluded on the 15th. Over the past five days, fifty-four delegates spoke, and they unanimously agreed with the reports.

At the meeting on the 15th, the delegates heard and approved the report by Bačílek, chairman of the Credentials Committee. He announced that a total of 1,393 delegates attended the congress.

The congress unanimously adopted a resolution approving the work of the CPCz Central Committee between the ninth and tenth congresses and taking Novotný's report as a guideline for the future activities of the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

At the meeting on the 15th, the congress delegates also heard the "Report on Amendments to the Party Constitution" made by Pášek on the fifth item on the agenda. Pášek said that the Party Constitution had helped the Party purify its ranks, strengthen Party and state discipline, and oppose incorrect views, opportunism, and the influence of alien ideologies. The Party Constitution has also improved the Party's working methods. However, due to the increasing severity of our national economic tasks, the requirements for the efficiency and level of Party work have also increased. Pášek cited some suggestions made by the Presidium of the Party Central Committee regarding amendments to the Party Constitution. He pointed out that, according to the suggestion of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee, Article 32 of the Party Constitution should be amended to read: "The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party elects a Political Bureau to lead the work of the Party during the recess of the plenary session of the Central Committee, and elects a Secretariat to lead the day-to-day work, mainly organizing the implementation of the Party's resolutions and checking their implementation, and selecting cadres."

The congress approved the amendments and supplements to the Party Constitution suggested in the report.

At the closing meeting, the congress elected the Party Central Committee, composed of 84 members and 28 alternate members. The congress also elected the Central Auditing Commission.

Finally, Zápotocký delivered a closing speech at the congress.

    捷共第十次代表大会闭幕
    批准捷共中央在两次代表大会之间的工作
    选出党的中央委员会和中央检查委员会
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会在十四、十五两日继续开会，并在十五日闭幕。
    大会代表对于诺沃提尼、什蒂特卡和西罗基分别就二、三、四项议程所作的报告的讨论，已在十五日结束。五天来共有五十四个代表发言，他们一致同意这些报告。
    在十五日会议上，代表听取并批准了资格审查委员会主席巴契列克的报告。他宣布：出席这次代表大会的共有一千三百九十三个代表。
    大会一致通过了一项决议，批准捷共中央在第九、第十两次代表大会之间的工作，把诺沃提尼的报告作为捷克斯洛伐克共产党今后活动的指针。
    在十五日会议上，大会代表还听取了帕歇克就第五项议程所作的“修改党章的报告”。帕歇克说，党章帮助党纯洁了自己的队伍，加强了党和国家的纪律，反对了不正确的观点、机会主义和异己的思想的影响。党章还使党的工作方法有了改善。但是，由于我们国民经济任务的日渐繁重，所以对党的工作效率和水平的要求也就提高了。帕歇克举出了党中央委员会主席团提出的关于修改党章的一些建议。他指出：根据党中央委员会主席团的建议，党章第三十二条应修改为：“捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会选举政治局以领导中央委员会全体会议休会期间党的工作，选举书记处以领导日常工作，主要是组织党的决议的执行和检查执行情况及选拔干部的工作。”
      大会批准了报告中建议的对党章的修改和补充。
    在闭幕会议上，大会选出了由八十四个委员和二十八个候补委员组成的党中央委员会。大会还选出了中央检查委员会。
    大会最后由萨波托斯基致闭幕词。
