    Looking to the Past, Comparing the Present, Hoping for the Future
    —A Record of the Constitution Draft Discussion Meeting at the Hongxing Collective Farm in the Suburbs of Beijing
    By Our Reporters Yu Ming and Jian Yuan
    On the night of the 15th, some members of the Hongxing Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing held a discussion meeting on the draft constitution after finishing a day's work. Every member, connecting with the past suffering, today's happy life, and the happy future, expressed their feelings about the draft constitution.
    Yu Chaokai, Chairman of the Collective Farm, said: The state is formulating a constitution to protect our fruits of victory. After reading the draft constitution, I had many thoughts. Since I was a child, I fled famine to NanYuan in Beijing, renting land from landlords and suffering from their exploitation and oppression. After liberation, this miserable life ended. I actively participated in the struggle to reform the land system, received land and houses, and gloriously joined the Party. Under the education of the Party, we initially organized mutual aid groups, and in the autumn of 1952, we established the collective farm. When the farm was first established, we encountered many difficulties, but with the help of the Party and the state, all the difficulties were overcome. In 1953, we had a bumper harvest, with an average cotton yield of 162 jin per mu, an increase of 62% compared to when we worked individually. As income increased, the lives of the members improved, and more than 20 households even installed electric lights. After last autumn, we cultivated a lot of land with tractors, and the farm gradually consolidated. After studying the general line, this year the number of members of the farm has expanded to 560 households; public property is increasing, now with 12,000 mu of land, 161 livestock, 54 carts, two cars, and two wells using electric pumps. The state has also built schools for us, and many of the members' children have enrolled. A flat road has been built from NanYuan to the farm, telephones have been installed, and a health clinic will also be built. This year, the farm responded to the call of the state and planted 7,000 mu of cotton. We will also develop the production of Chinese chives and grapes, and raise a large number of sheep and pigs. We are now doing a lot of breeding of dairy cows. We have already started planting trees, and in a few years, the entire farm will be greened. After the constitution is formulated, our lives will be even more guaranteed. We must join hands with our worker brothers to build our country into a socialist country.
    Qi Donghai, Secretary of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China at the Hongxing Collective Farm, said: After reading the draft constitution, I am indescribably happy. The Communist Party cultivated me, admitted me to the Party, and helped us establish the collective farm. Our township has more than 980 households, and it is the responsibility of all our Party members to guide them to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Now, there are dozens of Party members in the farm, and we must expand the Party ranks, cultivate activists, and improve the farm's production. We must also use the facts of running the farm well to promote all farmers in the country to take the socialist road. The constitution guarantees our fruits of victory, and we must better build the motherland in the future and live a happy socialist life.
    Zhang Fengqi, Vice Chairman of the Collective Farm, said: Today we are discussing the fundamental law of the country, and in the past, we did not have this right. Since I was a child, I have been doing handicrafts and have also been oppressed. Carrying tools to work, I could only do work if there was work today, and I would starve if there was no work tomorrow. After liberation, I was allocated land and became my own master, and I was able to live a peaceful life. We have now broken away from the poverty of the past. The draft constitution says that the state will help organized farmers develop production, which shows that our lives will get better and better in the future. Now, our farm is not yet ideal, but as long as everyone is of one mind, we will definitely be able to run it well.
    Zeng Lianyin, a member of the farm, said: In the past, I didn't understand what the constitution was, but now I know that the state is formulating a constitution to guarantee our happy life and let us move towards socialism. Every clause in the draft constitution is for building socialism, and I am really happy to read it. Since I was a child, I have been oppressed by landlords. Now I have land, a house, and I have also gotten married. In 1952, I joined the production cooperative and received more than six million yuan in one year. Last year, after joining the farm, my income increased to nine million yuan, but when I worked individually, I only earned three million yuan a year. Now we have used machines for production, and after the first five-year plan, the farm's production will definitely be greatly improved. At that time, everyone will live a better life, and it will not be difficult for every family to install electric lights and buy a radio.
    Zhao Xikai, a member of the farm, said: After reading the draft constitution, I thought of many things after liberation. For example, in 1950, there was a major flood in our area, and the state used the method of work-for-relief to help us overcome the difficulties in life; in the old society, it would have been difficult for people like me to survive. Today, I no longer worry about the lives of my family, I am just thinking about how to improve the farm's production. I think we can only produce more grain and supply the state, so that the worker brothers can build more machines for us, and our lives will get better. The draft constitution says that it is necessary to help our farms develop and to let us live a good life.
    Wang Dehai, a member of the farm, said: I feel that the provisions in the draft constitution are all to protect us working people. When I was a teenager, I was forced to run around and escape because the reactionaries were conscripting soldiers. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, I was really happy to see that those who had oppressed us in the past were suppressed. The Three-Anti and Five-Anti struggles also punished those unscrupulous merchants who made it impossible for us farmers to live in peace, and these things were all beneficial to us working people. Two years ago, I became seriously ill, and the cooperative sent me to Beijing for treatment. In the old society, no one would care about people like me who became seriously ill, but it is different in the new society. The concern of the members for me made me very moved. With the constitution, the happy days of the people are even more guaranteed. I will definitely lead everyone to produce well and build our farm even better.
    Li Liancheng, a member of the farm, said: I am a young man. I feel that living on the farm is really happy. I participate in labor production and learn culture and agricultural technology at the same time on the farm. The state values me very much, and this spring I was transferred to Beijing to study agricultural technology. I will work hard to apply it to production. In the future, I will also intensify my study of how to use machines to cultivate the land. The draft constitution stipulates that the state should care about us young people, which was something that could not even be dreamed of in the old society.
    Zhao Shuzhen, a female member of the farm, said: Because I am a woman, I feel particularly close to the rights of women stipulated in the draft constitution. In the old society, women were not allowed to be on paper. When I was eleven years old, my parents sent me to my husband's family, and because I couldn't do anything, I was oppressed by them. Now, women have turned over and not only have the right to discuss national affairs, but also have the right to manage national affairs. I participate in labor and enjoy the same economic status as men. It is also the same in politics. This year, I was elected as a people's representative in the general election.
    Gao Shuzhen, a female member of the farm, said: After listening to people explain the draft constitution, I thought of the past days. Before liberation, the oppression of us women by landlords and counter-revolutionaries need not be mentioned. After liberation, just as we women were participating in labor, landlords and remaining counter-revolutionaries spread rumors everywhere to obstruct us from participating in production and prevent us from turning over. The draft constitution says that it is necessary to protect the rights of us women, so I particularly support it.
    Wang Defu, a member of the farm, said: I am very happy today. We just elected our own representatives a few days ago, and now the draft constitution has been announced to protect our own rights with the constitution. After joining the farm, my family's life has improved. Last year, I received seven million yuan, and I don't feel any difficulty in life. Some people say that my spirit is particularly good this year compared to previous years, and this is because my life is getting better and better. The draft constitution says that it is necessary to guarantee our good life and to help our farms and cooperatives develop. We must study the draft constitution well and lead the members to study it well as well. We must tell them everything we know, so that everyone can work hard to run the farm well.
    He Shangyou, a model agricultural worker in Beijing and a member of the farm, said: I have never lived a good day in the old society. After liberation, my family was allocated land and joined the mutual aid group, and our life was a little better. When the farm was established two years ago, I thought that Chairman Mao's call would never be wrong, so I joined. Last year, my net income was seven million yuan, and my life improved. This year, my wife is taking care of seven children alone in the baby-holding group, and the family income is even higher, and life will be more prosperous. After last autumn, I was elected as a labor model and attended a meeting in Beijing. I was really happy in my heart. I also became a people's representative in the general election. The constitution is going to protect the rights we have already obtained, and it is also going to protect us to live better. I am even happier today.
    Chen Xiuxiang, a female member of the farm, said: Last year, when others guided me to join the farm, I was unwilling to join, and I even said that people were going to "take our land" and "calculate our livestock." Later, the crops on the farm grew better and better, and I slowly changed my mind. The year before last, my family income was only four million yuan, but last year, after joining the farm, my income reached eight million yuan, and I alone earned more than three million yuan. When I worked individually, I often brought my children to the field, which made adults tired and children suffer. After joining the farm, the baby-holding group takes care of the children, so I can participate in labor with peace of mind. I now know the benefits of the farm. Today, after hearing everyone say that the draft constitution stipulates that the state will also help us, I am even happier.
    Liu Jun, Du Xiliang, and other members also spoke at the discussion meeting, and they all expressed their inner thoughts. (Attached pictures)

    看过去，比现在，望将来
    ——记京郊红星集体农庄的宪法草案座谈会
    本报记者　于明  鉴远
    十五日夜里，北京郊区红星集体农庄的部分庄员，在结束了一天的劳动以后，开了一个关于宪法草案的座谈会。每一个庄员都联系着过去的苦难日子、今日的幸福生活以及幸福的未来，发表了自己对宪法草案的感想。
    集体农庄主席于朝凯说：国家制定宪法，是为了保护我们的胜利果实。我看了宪法草案，心里发生很多感想。我从小逃荒到北京南苑，租种地主的土地，受尽了地主的剥削和压迫。解放以后，这种苦难的生活便结束了。我积极参加了改革土地制度的斗争，分到了土地和房子，而且光荣地参加了党。在党的教育下，我们最初是组织互助组，一九五二年秋天就成立了集体农庄。农庄刚成立的时候，我们遇到了不少的困难，但在党和国家的帮助下，所有的困难都被克服了。一九五三年我们得到了丰收，棉花每亩的平均产量是一百六十二斤，比单干时提高了百分之六十二。由于收入增加，庄员们的生活改善了，有二十多户庄员还安装了电灯。去年秋后，我们有很多地都用拖拉机耕，农庄慢慢地巩固下来了。学习总路线以后，今年农庄的成员扩大到五百六十户；公共财产越来越多，现在已有土地一万二千亩，牲口一百六十一头，大车五十四辆，汽车两辆，用电力抽水的井两眼。国家又为我们修建了学校，庄员们的子弟很多都入了学。平坦的公路已从南苑修到了农庄里，电话也安装起来了，卫生所也将修建起来。今年农庄响应国家的号召，种了七千亩棉花。我们还要发展韭菜和葡萄的生产，养大批的羊和猪。现在正在大量配种繁殖乳牛。我们已经开始植树，用不了多少年，整个农庄就要绿化了。宪法制定以后，将使我们的生活得到更大的保证。我们要和工人兄弟拉起手来，把我国建设成社会主义的国家。
    中共红星集体农庄总支书记齐东海说：我看了宪法草案，有说不出的高兴。共产党培养了我，吸收我入了党，并帮助我们成立了集体农庄。我们这个乡共有九百八十多户，引导他们走互助合作的道路，是我们全体党员的责任。现在，农庄里已有几十个党员，我们还要扩大党的队伍，培养积极分子，把农庄生产搞好。我们还要用办好农庄的事实，推动全国农民都走社会主义的路。宪法使我们的胜利果实有了保障，我们以后要更好地建设祖国，过社会主义的幸福日子。
    集体农庄副主席张凤岐说：今天咱们讨论的是国家根本大法，过去咱们可没有这个权。我从小就耍手艺，也受压迫，背着工具做活，今天有活今天做，明天没活就得挨饿。解放以后，分了土地，自己当家作主了，才过上安心的日子。我们现在已经摆脱了过去的贫困日子。宪法草案中说，国家要帮助组织起来的农民发展生产，可见咱们的日子以后会越来越好。现在，我们的农庄还不是理想的，只要大家一条心，一定能把它办好。
    庄员曾连印说：过去我不懂得宪法是什么，现在我知道国家制定宪法就是要保障我们的幸福生活，让我们往社会主义走。宪法草案里的每一条，都是为了建设社会主义，我看了真高兴。我从小受地主的压迫，现在有了土地、房子，又结了婚。一九五二年，我参加了生产合作社，一年分到六百多万元，去年参加农庄后收入增加到九百万元，可是单干时，我一年才收入三百万元。现在我们已经用机器生产了，第一个五年计划以后，农庄的生产一定会大大提高。那时，大家生活过得更好，每家都将安上电灯，买个收音机也不会有什么困难了。
    庄员赵锡凯说：我看了宪法草案以后，想起了解放以后的很多事情。例如，一九五○年，我们这里发生了大涝灾，国家用以工代赈的办法，使我们克服了生活方面的困难；要是在旧社会，像我这样的人，怕是很难度过的。今天，我再也不耽心一家人的生活了，我只是想着怎样才能把农庄生产搞好。我想，我们只有多打粮食，供给国家，让工人老大哥给我们多造点机器，日子才能更好起来。宪法草案里说的也正是要帮助我们的农庄发展，要我们过好日子。
    庄员王德海说：我感觉到，宪法草案中规定的，都是为了保护我们劳动人民。我在十几岁时，因为反动派抓兵，被逼得东跑西逃，不得安生，在镇压反革命运动中，我看到那些过去压迫我们的人都被镇压了，真是高兴。三反、五反斗争又惩办了那些使我们农民不能过安生日子的奸商，这些事都是对我们劳动人民有好处的。我前二年得了重病，合作社把我送到北京去治疗。在旧社会里，像我这样的人得了重病，是不会有人管的，可是在新社会里就不一样了，社员对我的关心，使我很是感动。有了宪法，人民的幸福的日子更有了保障了。我一定带领大家好好生产，把我们的农庄建设得更好。
    庄员李连成说：我是个青年。我觉得生活在农庄里真是快乐。我在农庄一边参加劳动生产，一边学文化和农业技术。国家很看重我，今年春天把我调到北京学习农业技术，我要努力把它用到生产上去。今后我还要加紧学习用机器种地的方法。宪法草案规定，国家要关心我们青年，在旧社会里，那是连做梦也想不到的。
    女庄员赵淑祯说：因为我是个妇女，对宪法草案里所规定的妇女权利，感到特别亲切。旧社会里妇女是上不得纸张的。我十一岁时，父母把我送到婆家，因为不会做事，就受人家的压迫。现在，妇女翻了身，不但有权利讨论国家的事，还有权管理国家的事。我参加了劳动，在经济上享受到了同男子平等的地位。在政治上也是这样，今年普选时我就被选为人民代表。
    女庄员高淑珍说：我听人讲解了宪法草案以后，就想起了过去的日子。解放前，地主、反革命分子对我们妇女的压迫就不用提了。解放以后，我们妇女刚刚参加了劳动，地主和残余的反革命分子还给我们到处造谣言，阻挠我们参加生产，不让我们翻身。宪法草案里说要保护我们妇女的权利，所以我特别拥护。
    庄员王德福说：我今天很高兴。我们前些日子才选举了自己的代表，现在又公布了宪法草案，要用宪法来保护我们自己的权利了。参加了农庄，我家的生活才提高起来。去年，我分了七百万元，生活不感到困难了。有的人说，我今年的精神比往年特别好，这就是因为我的日子越过越好了。宪法草案里说要保障我们的好日子，要帮助我们的农庄、合作社发展，我们一定要学习好宪法草案，并带领庄员们也学习好。我们要把自己知道的都告诉他们，使大家都来努力，把农庄办好。
    北京市农业劳动模范、庄员贺尚友说：我在旧社会从来没有过过一天好日子。解放以后，我家分了地，又参加了互助组，生活才过的好了点。前年农庄成立时，我想到毛主席的号召总不会错，就参加了。去年净收入七百万元，生活好起来了。今年我的老婆在抱娃娃组一个人带着七个孩子，全家收入更多了，生活会更富裕。去年秋后，我被选为劳动模范，到北京开了会，我心里真高兴。在普选时我又当了人民代表。宪法要保护我们已经得到的权利，并且还要保护我们过的更好，我今天更是高兴了。
    女庄员陈秀香说：去年，当别人引导我参加农庄时，我不愿意参加，还说人家要“收我们的土地了”，“计算我们的牲口了”，到后来农庄的庄稼越长越好，我才慢慢把思想转变过来。前年，我家收入才四百万元，去年参加了农庄，收入就达到八百万元，我自己一个人就收入三百多万元。单干时我常把孩子带到地里，使得大人受累，孩子受罪。参加了农庄，抱娃娃组把孩子管起来了，我才能放心参加劳动。我现在可知道农庄的好处了。今天听大家都说，宪法草案里规定，国家还要帮助我们，我就更高兴。
    在座谈会上发言的还有庄员刘俊、杜希良等，他们也都说出了自己的心里话。（附图片）
