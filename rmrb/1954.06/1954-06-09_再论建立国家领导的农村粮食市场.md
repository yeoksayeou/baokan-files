A nationally led rural grain market is being established across the country. Initial reports indicate that this new type of market, utilizing old forms while changing its content, is simple, easy to implement, suits farmers' habits, and meets the needs of the state. Therefore, once established, it demonstrates positive effects and is welcomed by the masses. Although some difficulties are inevitable in the initial establishment due to lack of experience, these difficulties can be overcome with careful leadership and continuous improvement of working methods. It would be inappropriate, and would lead to greater difficulties, to doubt the role of this market and relax the establishment of the market, or even adopt other unrealistic methods to solve the extremely urgent and important task of grain regulation and supply in rural areas.

Now, the question is no longer whether to establish a rural grain market, but how to further solve the practical issues of establishment time, steps, and methods. To this end, we believe it is necessary to reiterate the following points for attention in various regions:

First, the establishment of markets should be widespread, timely, and rapid. Before the summer harvest, it is the most critical and vigorous period for rural grain exchange and regulation. The state must seriously and responsibly do a good job in supplying grain to grain-deficient households during this period. However, when organizing planned supply, we must consider the complexity of commodity distribution in the vast scope, short time, and extremely dispersed rural economic conditions; we must consider the unavoidable contradictions between planned supply and farmers' habits. How to ensure that the planned supply work avoids being time-consuming and inefficient, and is timely, effective, reasonable, and cost-effective is a major issue. As a supplementary form of commodity distribution, the new type of grain market can mobilize the reserve force of marketable grain in rural areas to compensate for the weakness of the state's planned supply in terms of single grain varieties; on the other hand, it can make up for certain imbalances and unreasonable distribution caused by the lack of widespread institutions and in-depth work of state-owned commercial and cooperative organizations. This new type of grain market is an indispensable form that must be widely adopted by the state when implementing the grain planned supply policy. It not only needs to be established quickly, but also should be established universally. Delay will delay the work, and too few will not work. Spring has passed and the summer harvest is approaching, but the market establishment work in many areas is still in the pilot stage, preparing to wait until mature experience is gained from the experiment before slowly promoting it. Many comrades overestimate the difficulties of the work and underestimate the objective needs, progressing slowly, lagging behind the demands of the masses, thus delaying the serious resolution of grain problems in some areas. This situation is obviously incorrect and should be changed quickly. We must strive to establish primary markets in all small towns that were originally grain distribution centers in a relatively short period of time, so as not to miss the opportunity, affect production, and fall into a passive position.

Second, once the rural grain market is established, the state's leadership must be strengthened. Because the establishment of this new type of market is both an economic task and a political task. As an economic task, it requires a series of organizational tasks, such as establishing offices, establishing systems, introducing transactions, statistical inspection, controlling prices, etc. As a political task, it requires extensive publicity and education work to explain policies to farmers, explain systems, and raise farmers' awareness, etc. From the experience of various regions, these two aspects of the task are closely integrated and must be strengthened simultaneously. Because this market is different from the old free market. The old free market was manipulated by commercial capital, and the farmers who entered the market participated in transactions blindly, completely controlled by prices. No one cared whether they should buy or sell, or whether they were getting a good deal. The new market is led by the people's government, so it must fully take care of the interests and demands of all farmers participating in the transaction. To achieve this, we must resolutely restrict commercial speculation to safeguard common interests, and at the same time adapt to the original habits of farmers and give them as much convenience as possible. It is indeed a complex task to meet the needs of farmers, adapt to the habits of farmers, and fight against capitalist forces. Therefore, we must never give up leadership and let it go its own way. Party and government leading organs at all levels must designate specialized organs such as industrial and commercial administrative departments, grain commercial departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives to be responsible for guiding market operations, implement management by division of labor, and pay attention to selecting and training a group of trading personnel who understand policies and are good at mass work to do a good job in the necessary organizational work. In addition, and more importantly, all party and government and mass organization personnel should work together to carry out mass political work. This political work must be carried out not only in the market, but also in every village. It is necessary to clearly explain to the farmers: After each farmer completes the task of delivering and selling to the state, it is completely legal to take the surplus grain to the national market to sell, and no one is allowed to interfere casually. When conducting transactions, the market stipulates various necessary systems, the purpose is to prevent speculative merchants from destroying, not to embarrass farmers, these regulations are good for everyone, and will never cause losses to individuals. This publicity and explanation work should be carried out simultaneously with the good management of the rural market, so that the market is easy to manage well, and farmers are easy to accept.

Third, management systems should be established and improved according to local conditions and time. The basic system that must be adhered to in the nationally led grain market is that grain merchants are not allowed to participate. Allowing grain merchants to participate will inevitably change the nature of the market and also affect the stability of grain prices. In order to prevent grain merchants from mixing in, it is necessary to stipulate some necessary procedures for farmers to participate in transactions. The boundary between the strictness and leniency of these procedures is that leniency cannot be so lenient as to abandon restrictions on merchants, and strictness cannot be so strict as to hit farmers' trading interest. Generally speaking, in the initial establishment, if the local national supply power is sufficient to meet the needs and stabilize grain prices, and private grain merchants have no opportunity to speculate; or if it is estimated that there is still a lot of surplus grain in the local area, and there are not many grain-deficient households, in this case, it is beneficial and harmless to relax a little and simplify a little in terms of transaction limits, issuing certificates, and price increases and decreases. In different situations where strict procedures are required, it should naturally be stricter. If the procedures are relaxed and simplified, it will inevitably cause some unreasonable phenomena, such as households that should buy less buy more, and households that should not buy also buy in, but as long as the ones who buy more are farmers and handicraft workshops, and they are for self-consumption, not for speculative purposes, there is no need to pursue too much. Because the system needs a working process from being relatively reasonable to being more reasonable, and the procedures need a working process from being not very meticulous to being more meticulous. The primary requirement at present is to activate the normal commodity grain exchange. Once this requirement is met, with the further close relationship between the government and farmers, and the further improvement of farmers' awareness, the system and procedures will also be further improved, which is more practical and effective.

In addition to grain and oil, farmers can bring other products to the market for free exchange, and all commodity exchanges should not be restricted with quota prices and other restrictive procedures. In addition to grain-deficient households, general handicraft workshops such as flour mills, tofu workshops, and pasta industries should also be allowed to purchase the necessary grain and oil crops in the market and should not be ignored. Many places arbitrarily expand the scope of restricted transactions, thereby promoting a tense situation in the entire rural economic exchange, which is wrong and must be corrected quickly.

### 再论建立国家领导的农村粮食市场

    再论建立国家领导的农村粮食市场
    国家领导的农村粮食市场，正在全国各地开始建立。初步的情况说明，这种新型市场，由于利用了旧的形式，又改变了它的内容，既简便易行，适合农民习惯，又符合于国家需要。因此，一经建立，就显示出良好的作用，受到群众欢迎。虽然在初建立的时候，由于缺乏经验，不可免地会遇到一些困难；但这种困难，只要注意领导，不断改进工作方法，就会得到克服。遇到一点困难，就怀疑这种市场的作用，放松市场的建立工作，甚至采用另外一些不切实际的办法，去解决极其紧迫重大的乡村粮食调剂和供应任务，那是很不妥当的，是会引来更大困难的。
    现在已经不是讨论应不应该建立农村粮食市场的问题，而应该是进一步解决建立的时间、步骤、方法等实际工作问题了。为此，我们认为有必要再次提出以下几点，请各地加以注意：
    第一、市场的建立要普遍，要及时，要迅速。夏收以前，正是农村粮食交换与调剂最紧要最旺盛的时机，国家一定要在这个时机内认真负责作好对缺粮户的粮食供应工作。但当组织计划供应时，我们不能不考虑到在极大的范围，极短的时间，极度分散的农村经济条件下，进行商品分配工作的复杂性；不能不考虑到计划供应和农民习惯势力之间的难以避免的某些矛盾，如何使计划供应工作避免费时误事，能做到及时有效而又合理合算，乃是一个极大的问题。新型的粮食市场，作为一种辅助性的商品分配形式，一方面可以调动乡村商品粮的后备力量，以弥补国家计划供应时粮食品种单纯的弱点；
  一方面又可以弥补国家商业、合作组织由于机构不普遍和工作不深入而形成的某种分配不平衡、不合理的缺陷。这种新型的粮食市场，正是国家执行粮食计划供应政策时必须广泛采用的不可缺少的一种形式，它不但需要很快建立，而且应该普遍地建立。迟了，耽误工作，少了，不起作用。春季已过夏收将届，但许多地区的市场建立工作，还停留在试点阶段，准备等到试验工作取得成熟经验，而后再慢慢推广；许多工作同志过高估计了工作困难，而过低估计了客观需要，稳步不进，落后于群众要求，从而延缓了某些地区对于粮食问题的认真解决。这种情况，显然是不正确的，应当迅速改变。必须争取在较短的时期内，在一切原来就是粮食集散点的小市镇上，将初级市场普遍建立起来，以免丧失时机，影响生产，陷于被动。
    第二、农村粮食市场既经建立，就必须加强国家的领导。因为建立这种新型市场，既是一项经济工作，又是一项政治工作。作为经济工作，需要一系列的组织任务，如设立办事机构，建立制度，介绍交易，统计检查，掌握价格等等。作为政治工作，需要极广泛的宣传教育工作，向农民交代政策，讲解制度，提高农民觉悟等等。从各地经验看来，这两方面的任务是密切结合，必须同时加强的。因为这种市场，不同于旧的自由市场。旧日的自由市场，是被商业资本操纵着，上市的农民们盲目地参加交易、完全被价格所支配，该买该卖，便宜吃亏是没有人来关怀他们的。而新型的市场，则是人民政权领导的，那就不能不充分照顾所有参加交易的农民的利益与要求。而要做到这一点，就必须一方面坚决限制商业投机，以维护共同利益，一方面要适应农民原有习惯，尽量给农民以便利。既要满足农民需要，适应农民习惯，又要和资本主义势力进行斗争。这的确是一个复杂的任务。因此，绝不可放弃领导，任其自流。各级党政领导机关，必须指定专门的机关如工商行政部门、粮食商业部门、供销合作社等负责指导市场业务，分工实行管理，并注意挑选、培养出一批懂得政策、会做群众工作的交易员来，做好必要的组织工作。此外，更其重要的，是全体党政及群众团体工作人员一齐动手，进行群众政治工作。这种政治工作，不但在市场上，也须在各个乡村中进行。要清楚地向农民解释：每个农户完成向国家的交售任务后，拿余粮到国家市场上出卖是完全合法的，任何人不得随便干涉。在进行交易时，市场规定各种必要的制度，目的是为了防止投机商人破坏，而不是去为难农民，这些规定对大家都有好处，对个人也绝不会吃亏的。这种宣传解释工作要结合着办好农村市场同时进行，这样边讲边做，边做边讲，市场就容易办好，农民也就容易接受。
    第三、要因地、因时制宜，建立与改进管理制度。在国家领导的粮食市场上必须坚持的基本制度，是不许粮商参加。允许粮商参加，必然使市场变质，还会影响到粮价的稳定。为了防止粮商混入，对于农民参加交易就不能不规定一些必要的手续。这些手续的宽严界线，是宽不能宽到放弃对商人的限制，严不可严到打击农民的交易兴趣。一般地讲，在初创办时，当地国家供应力量足够满足需要与稳定粮价，私人粮商无机可投；或者估计当地余粮还不少，而缺粮户又不太多，在这种情况下，在交易限额方面，在开具证明，价格升降诸方面，放宽一点，简便一点，是有利无害的。在与此不同的情况下需要严密手续时，就自然应该严密一点。手续放宽些，简便些，必然引起某些不很合理的现象，如应少买的户多买了，不该买的户也买进了，但，只要多买进的是农民，是手工作坊，他们是为了自食自用，不是为了套购投机，也不必过多追究。因为制度由比较合理到更合理，手续由不很周密到更周密，需要一个工作过程，当前首要的要求是要将正常的商品粮食交流活跃起来，这个要求达到了，随着政府与农民的关系进一步密切，农民觉悟进一步提高，制度与手续也进一步改善，这才是更切合实际、更有效果的做法。
    除粮食和油料以外，农民自带其他产品来市场交易，更可以任其自由交换，而不应把所有商品交换都去规定限额价格等限制手续。除缺粮户外，一般手工作坊如粉坊、豆腐坊、面食业等，也应允许到市场采购其所必需的粮食与油料作物，不应置之不理。不少地方任意扩大限制交易范围，从而促成整个农村经济交流的紧张状况，是错误的，必须迅速得到纠正。
