    Shanghai Communications Factory Supports Korean Construction
    300 Telephones Completed Ahead of Schedule
    The Shanghai Communications Factory of the Ministry of Railways, which is undertaking the production of 400 portable leather bag telephones to support peaceful construction in Korea, has already completed 300 units ahead of schedule.
    When the factory received the order from Korea in January, the original plan was to complete it by the end of August. The factory workers believed that helping the Korean people rebuild their homeland meant that the delivery date should be as early as possible. Inspired by the spirit of internationalism, they completed 200 units in March ahead of schedule. On June 19, they completed another 100 units. The remaining 100 units will be ready for delivery by the end of June.

    上海通信工厂支援朝鲜建设
    提前造好电话机三百台
    铁道部上海通信工厂承造支援朝鲜和平建设的四百台携带式皮包电话机，已有三百台提前造好。
    这批电话机在一月份接受朝鲜订货时，原定八月底完成。该厂职工认为帮助朝鲜人民重建家园，交货日期应该愈早愈好，在国际主义精神的鼓舞下，三月份即提前完成了二百台；六月十九日又完成了一百台。还有一百台在六月底即可全部出厂。
