    Our workshop is now entirely using machines for production
    Model Laborer of Mudanjiang City, Wang Haide
    Our medicinal material processing workshop at the Mudanjiang State-Owned No. 1 Rubber Factory specializes in processing raw materials for the production workshops. In the past, more than two-thirds of the work in the entire workshop relied on manual labor. For example, to sieve medicinal materials, one had to hold a clumsy wooden sieve with both hands and shake it back and forth. After a long time, the arms would ache. Some older workers said, "Using arms and legs as machines, it's really exhausting all day." Another example is cutting mixed rubber, which used to be done by hand with a knife. After a while, blisters would form on the hands. Smashing medicinal materials was also done manually, with people squatting on iron plates and swinging small iron hammers, causing sore backs and aching legs. Because our workshop relied on manual labor, production efficiency was very low. No matter how hard the workers tried, they couldn't meet the needs of the production workshops. Our workshop also had a very poor working environment, with medicinal powder flying all over the place, affecting the workers' health. Therefore, the sick leave rate was very high. Our workshop had the highest sick leave rate in the entire factory. To solve this problem, the factory installed dust extraction machines for us and distributed sponge oxygen cylinders, work clothes, and masks. However, this couldn't completely solve the problem. Later, I started thinking about how to make the workers' work less tiring and ensure their health at the same time. Initially, we built a bathhouse, and I thought this might reduce some of the workers' fatigue, but the workers were still using clumsy sieves and small iron hammers, medicinal powder was still flying all over the place, and workers were still taking sick leave every three days and getting sick every two days. Medicinal materials couldn't be processed, and the workers in the production workshops were urging us closely. What to do? This really stumped me.
    Once, I was watching a Soviet movie. The movie showed an excavator, and a Soviet worker moved a small lever, and the excavator's large iron shovel "whoosh" scooped up a large chunk of soil. I was inspired by this, and I immediately shouted, "Our processing workshop needs to do the same!" After watching the movie, I made up my mind to find a way to replace manual labor with machines, just like the Soviet workers. I took on this task at the Party branch meeting. From then on, I often pondered the matter of creating machines. The Party branch secretary often came to ask me about any difficulties and requests and helped me think of many solutions. To help me succeed in the creation, the Party also extracted a comrade from the production post to specifically assist me. In addition, many people helped me solve the difficulties encountered in the creation.
    After more than four months of painstaking research, I finally created a closed electric sieve, an electric hard material pulverizer, an electric lifting cutter, and an electric waste cord fabric cutting machine in succession. With the closed electric sieve, there is no need to shake the medicinal materials by hand at all. In the past, using hand shaking, only 36 kilograms could be sieved per hour, but now 190 kilograms can be sieved per hour. In the past, smashing rawhide glue was done by hand with a hammer on an iron plate, and only 27 kilograms could be smashed per hour. Now, with a push of the switch, the electric hard material pulverizer automatically smashes, and 170 kilograms can be smashed per hour. In the past, cutting mixed rubber by hand with a knife only cut 8 kilograms per hour. Now, with the electric lifting cutter, as long as one person refills the material next to it, 40 kilograms can be cut per hour. In the past, cutting waste cord fabric rubber required four people to hold it down and two people to cut it. Now, one person stands next to the electric waste cord fabric cutting machine to manage it, and the electric knife cuts it. The work efficiency is three times higher than manual operation. From then on, except for sieving zinc oxide, which is done manually, all other operations in our workshop are done by machine. Production efficiency has increased fivefold compared to before, and the workshop no longer sees medicinal powder flying all over the place. The number of people taking sick leave has also been greatly reduced.
    On April 13th, I also successfully made a special electric sieve for zinc oxide. From then on, our medicinal material processing workshop was completely operated by machines. I am very happy now. This is not only because the machines have been made, but more happily is that I have completed the task assigned to me by the Party. The little thing I have done for the country is far from enough compared to the Party's painstaking education of me and the enthusiasm of everyone helping me. I must not be arrogant or complacent, and I will work hard to improve my cultural and technical level, earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and unite with all the workers to solve key problems in production and make more achievements to answer the Party's education and everyone's expectations of me.

    我们车间全部使用机器来生产了
    牡丹江市特等劳动模范　王海德
    我们牡丹江国营第一橡胶厂的药料加工车间，是专门给生产车间加工原材料的，过去全车间的工作有三分之二以上要靠手工操作。例如，筛药料就得用两手拿着笨木筛子前后摇荡，时间长了胳膊就痛，有的老工人说：“拿胳膊腿当机器用，一天真够累的。”再如，割混合胶，过去也是用手拿刀割，时间一长手就要磨出血泡来。砸药料也是同样用手工操作，人蹲在铁板上抡起小铁锤子砸，累的腰疼腿酸。因为我们车间都用手工操作，所以生产效率很低，工人们无论怎样加劲干，也供应不上生产车间的需要。我们车间工作环境也很坏，药粉满屋飞扬，影响了工人们的健康，因此，病假率很高，我们车间是全厂请病假最多的车间，厂里为了解决这个问题，曾给我们安了抽尘机，并发给大家海绵氧气瓶、工作服、口罩等。但还不能彻底解决问题。后来我就想办法要使工人工作既不累，又能保证身体健康。开始我们修了一个澡堂子，我以为这回可能减少一些工人的劳累，但工人们工作仍旧是用笨筛子、小铁锤，药粉仍是满屋飞扬，工人仍是三天请假，两天生病的，药料加工不出来，生产车间的工人跟在屁股后面紧催。怎么办呢，这下可真把我难住了。
    有一次我看苏联电影，电影里照出一台挖土机，一个苏联工人搬了一下小杆，挖土机的大铁铲子“哗”的一下就掀起来一大块土。从这上面我得到了启发，当时我就喊出来：“我们加工车间也得这样干！”看完电影，我就下定决心，要像苏联工人一样想办法用机器代替手工操作，我在党支部会上就把这个任务要过来了，从此，我就经常琢磨创造机器的事。党支部书记经常来问我有什么困难和要求，并且帮助我想了不少办法，党为了帮助我创造成功，又从生产岗位上抽出一个同志来专门帮助我。另外还有许多人帮助我解决了创造中所遇到的困难。
    经过四个多月的苦心钻研，我终于连续创造了密闭式电动筛子，电动硬质粉碎机，电动升降切刀机和电动割废帘线胶机。有了密闭式电动筛子，筛药料时根本用不着拿手去摇荡了，从前用手摇，每小时才筛三十六公斤，现在每小时可筛一百九十公斤。过去砸牛皮胶是用手拿着锤子在铁板上砸，一小时只能砸二十七公斤，现在一推电门，电动硬质粉碎机就自动地砸起来，一小时能砸一百七十公斤。过去用手拿刀切混合胶，一小时只切八公斤，现在用电动升降切刀机，只要一个人在旁边续料，一小时就切四十公斤。过去割废帘子线胶要四个人按住，两个人割，现在一个人站在电动割废帘线胶机旁边管理，电刀就割起来了，工作效率较人工操作提高三倍。从此我们车间除筛氧化锌用手工操作外，其余全部用机器操作了。生产效率较前提高五倍，车间再也看不到药粉满屋飞扬，因病请假的人也大大减少了。
    四月十三日，我把氧化锌专用电动筛子也制作成功了，从此我们药料加工车间就完全用机器操作了。我现在的心情很愉快，这不光是机器已经做成了，更愉快的是我完成了党所交给我的任务。我给国家所作的这点事，要和党教育我的苦心比起来，要和大家帮助我的热情比起来还差得很远，我一定不骄傲，不自满，努力提高文化和技术水平，认真学习苏联先进经验，和全体工人团结在一起，解决生产上的关键问题，作出更多的成绩来回答党对我的教养和大家对我的期望。
