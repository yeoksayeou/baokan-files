Xinhua News Agency, June 11th: The national population survey confirms that China's population mortality rate is declining rapidly. This downward trend is particularly evident among infants. Many survey figures show that mortality rates have fallen sharply in just the two to three years of China's economic recovery. According to a Beijing survey, the population mortality rate in November 1950 was 11 per 10,000, and it decreased year by year, falling to 6 per 10,000 in November 1953. In Wuhan, the average daily death toll in 1950 was 72, but by 1953, the average daily death toll had fallen to 47. Due to the improvement of people's living standards, better medical and health conditions, and the implementation of the New Marriage Law, the unfortunate phenomena of infanticide and early death due to poor medical and health conditions have been greatly reduced. Sichuan Province has established more than 2,300 maternal and child health institutions, widely promoting new methods of midwifery, and changing the past situation of large-scale infant mortality. In Peng County, Sichuan Province, a woman named Wen Yangshi had eleven children who all died in the past; when she gave birth to her twelfth child, she received new-style midwifery, and now the child is growing up healthy and chubby. In the early days of liberation, the phenomenon of drowning and abandoning infants was still very serious in Huanjing and Huimin townships in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province; after last year's campaign to promote and implement the Marriage Law, the phenomenon of drowning and abandoning infants has been basically eliminated. In 1949, in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, infants who died from "Si Liu Feng" (a local infant disease) accounted for 57% of births. In Xiacuan Village, Lingchuan County, this prefecture, the population had not grown since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, remaining at around 470 people; since the implementation of new-style midwifery, the infant mortality rate has decreased, and by 1953, the village population had quickly increased to 515 people.

The decline in infant mortality has relatively shown an increase in the number of children in society. Surveys from various regions all indicate that the proportion of children in the total population has been increasing year by year since liberation. The increase in the number of the new generation has brought new changes to the age structure of China's population. According to statistics from 14 centrally-administered municipalities and 5 provinces, the population under 29 years of age averages 64.1% of the total population. According to 1939 statistics, the population under the age of 29 in the Soviet Union accounted for 63.1% of the total population, while in the United Kingdom, those under 29 accounted for only 50%, and in France, only 47%.

Xinhua News Agency, June 12th: Many centenarians have been discovered in China's population survey. According to statistics from 166 counties (banners) and the Lushun-Dalian city in Rehe, Jilin, Liaodong, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Fujian, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Gansu, Sichuan, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are 51,255 people aged 80 to 100, and 286 people over 100 years old. Among them, Xinjiang Province has 15 people who are 130 years old.

These centenarians are all from working-class backgrounds. Diligent labor has made them physically healthy. Many centenarians still have good eyesight and hearing, and continue to engage in labor. Fu Cai, a 125-year-old man from Jilin Province, has been diligently engaged in labor for more than a century and was elected as a forestry model in Jilin Province last year. Lan Lishi, a 135-year-old Yao woman from the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province, was an outstanding labor model in her early years. Now she is still in good health, able to sweep the yard, wash and dry clothes, and walk without a cane.

Local people's governments respect and care for these centenarians, organizing farmers to help them with production, or allocating grain and funds to help them solve their livelihood problems. When Cui Xin, a 106-year-old man from a tenant farmer background in Zhongning County, Ningxia Province, celebrated his 106th birthday, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government sent a special representative and county and district cadres to congratulate him and presented him with gifts such as bedding, clothing materials, and food. Dong, an old woman of 103 years old, lives in Shengli Village, Changbai County, Liaodong Province. Her son, Dong Licai, is also 79 years old. Mother and son came here from Shandong Province more than 50 years ago. Before liberation, they had been farming for landlords and living in poverty. During land reform, they were given land and their lives improved. This spring, the local people's government gave the mother and son two sets of bedding and some clothes, and gave them some rice, flour and other food; the staff of local organs also donated some gifts to the centenarian, and specially invited a doctor to examine her. Many old people enjoy a happy life in their later years, are healthy, and have a more cheerful spirit.

    从全国人口调查中证实
    我国人口死亡率正在迅速下降
    各地已发现长寿老人五万一千多人
    【新华社十一日讯】从这次全国人口调查中，证实我国人口死亡率正在迅速下降。下降的趋势特别明显地表现在幼儿中。许多调查数字表明，仅仅在我国经济恢复时期的两三年内，死亡率就直线地降低下来。根据北京市调查，一九五零年十一月人口死亡率是万分之十一，以后逐年下降，到一九五三年十一月已降为万分之六。武汉市一九五零年平均每天死亡七十二人，到一九五三年，平均每天死亡的数字已降低到四十七人。由于人民生活的提高，医疗卫生条件的改善和新婚姻法的贯彻，历史上虐杀婴儿和因医药卫生条件不好早期死亡的不幸现象已大大减少。四川省由于建立了二千三百多个妇幼卫生机构，广泛地推广了新法接生，改变了过去婴儿大批死亡的状况。四川省彭县有一个妇女名叫文杨氏，过去生了十一个孩子都死了；她生第十二个孩子时，接受了新法接生，现在孩子长得胖胖的。江苏省太仓县璜泾、惠民两乡在解放初期，溺婴、弃婴的现象还很严重；经过去年宣传和贯彻婚姻法运动月以后，溺婴、弃婴的现象已基本消灭了。山西省长治专区在一九四九年时，婴儿死于“四六风”的占出生数百分之五十七。这个专区的陵川县下川村，从清朝光绪年间起，人口始终没有增长，停留在四百七十人上下；自从实行新法接生后，婴儿死亡率减少了，到一九五三年，全村人口很快增到五百一十五人。
    幼儿死亡率的下降，相对地显示出社会上孩子的增多。从各地的调查中都说明解放后幼儿在总人口中的比重逐年增大。新生一代人口数量的增加，使我国人口在年龄组合上出现了新的情况。根据十四个中央直辖市和五个省统计，二十九岁以下的人口平均占总人口的百分之六十四点一。根据一九三九年的统计，在苏联未满二十九岁的人口占总人口百分之六十三点一，在英国，二十九岁以下的仅占百分之五十，在法国仅占百分之四十七。
    【新华社十二日讯】在我国人口调查中，发现很多长寿老人。据热河、吉林、辽东、新疆、青海、陕西、福建、江苏、云南、甘肃、四川、内蒙古自治区等地一百六十六个县（旗）和旅大市的统计，八十岁到一百岁的老人有五万一千二百五十五人，一百岁以上的有二百八十六人。其中新疆省一百三十岁的老人就有十五个。
    这些长寿老人都是劳动人民出身。辛勤的劳动生活使他（她）们的体质都很健康。很多百岁以上的老人至今眼不花耳不聋，继续从事劳动。吉林省有一位一百二十五岁的名叫傅财的老人，辛勤不息地从事了百年多的劳动，去年还被选为吉林省林业模范。广西省桂西僮族自治区有一位一百三十五岁的瑶族老太太蓝李氏，早年是一个出色的劳动能手。现在她的身体还很健康，能打扫院子、洗晒衣服，走路不用拐杖。
    各地人民政府都十分尊重和照顾这些长寿老人，组织农民帮助他们进行生产，或者拨粮拨款帮助他们解决生活上的困难。宁夏省中宁县雇农出身的一百零六岁的崔信老人，在他一百零六岁的寿辰时，宁夏省人民政府派了专人和县区干部一起去给他祝寿，并赠送了被褥、衣料、食品等寿礼。辽东省长白县胜利村有一位一百零三岁的董老大娘，她的儿子董立财也已经七十九岁了。母子俩在五十多年前就从山东省来到这里。解放前一直给地主种地，过着贫困的生活。土地改革时分得了土地，生活好转了。今年春天当地人民政府赠给他母子两人两套被褥和几件衣服，并送给一些大米、白面等食品；当地各机关职工也为这位百岁老人捐献了一些礼品，还特意请医生为她检查身体。许多老人因享受了晚年的幸福生活，身体健康，精神更加愉快。
