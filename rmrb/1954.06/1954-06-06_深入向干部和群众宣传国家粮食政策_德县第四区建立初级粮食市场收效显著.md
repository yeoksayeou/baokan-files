Intensify the Promotion of National Grain Policies to Cadres and the Masses
    Significant Results Achieved in Establishing Primary Grain Markets in the Fourth District of De County

    The establishment of state grain markets in the Fourth District of De County, Shandong Province, has yielded excellent results.

    During the process of establishing grain markets, the district first conducted propaganda and mobilization work in six townships, reaching from Party members to non-Party members, and from cadres to the masses. Addressing the ideological obstacles among cadres at the time, the importance of establishing national grain markets was explained, and the national grain policy was comprehensively clarified, enabling cadres to distinguish between various policy boundaries. Simultaneously, the nature of the national grain market and related policies were explained. At meetings of rural Party members, League members, activists, and the masses, it was officially announced that the previous year's grain unified purchase work had concluded, and the state's grain policy, as well as policies related to the national grain market, were comprehensively publicized, dispelling the ideological concerns of some of the masses. The grain market in Aifangji, the central market town of these six townships, opened on April 26th, with over 990 jin of grain entering the market that day. In subsequent market days, the number of people coming to the market to exchange grain seeds, adjust surpluses and deficits, and buy raw materials gradually increased to one or two thousand. Farmer Li Yongcai, who originally requested grain supplies from the state, said: "I originally had 200 jin of corn stored, so I wanted the state to supply some millet and beans to mix in, but now I can exchange them myself with others." Farmers in Biejiliu Township originally planned to plant only 5,500 mu of cotton, but after hearing the publicity about establishing grain markets, they quickly increased the planting area by 120 mu. Some farmers also plan to raise more hairy pigs.

    深入向干部和群众宣传国家粮食政策
    德县第四区建立初级粮食市场收效显著
    山东省德县第四区建立国家粮食市场收到很好效果。
    在建立粮食市场的过程中，该区首先在六个乡从党内到党外，从干部到群众进行了宣传动员。根据当时干部中的思想障碍，说明了建立国家粮食市场的重要意义，全面地交代了国家粮食政策，使干部划清了各种政策界限，同时说明了国家粮食市场的性质和有关政策。在农村党员、团员、积极分子以及群众会议上，正式宣布上一年度粮食统购工作已经结束，全面宣传了国家的粮食政策以及有关国家粮食市场的政策，解除了部分群众的思想顾虑。这六个乡的中心集市——艾坊集的粮食市场在四月二十六日开张，即上市粮食九百九十多斤；以后的集日，到市场上调换粮种、调剂有无、买原料粮的，陆续增加到一两千人。原来要求国家供应粮食的农民李永才说：“我本来还存着二百斤玉米，所以想让国家供应点谷子和豆子掺着吃，现在我自己和别人调换就行了。”簸箕刘乡的农民原来只准备种五千五百亩棉花，听到关于建立粮食市场的宣传以后，很快就增种了一百二十亩棉花。有些农民还计划增养毛猪。
