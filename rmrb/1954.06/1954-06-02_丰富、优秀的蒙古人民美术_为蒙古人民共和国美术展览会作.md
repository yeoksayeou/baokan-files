    Rich and Excellent Fine Arts of the Mongolian People
    ——On the Occasion of the Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of Mongolia
    Liu Kaiqu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association
    The Art Exhibition of the People's Republic of Mongolia has opened in our capital city. Our people and our artists warmly welcome this exhibition, because it enriches the cultural life of our people and provides a valuable opportunity for our artists to observe the brilliant achievements of the Mongolian people's artists.
    When the exhibits were taken out of the boxes one by one, I watched them one by one, and I was deeply attracted by them. After being introduced by Comrade Dorjiin Choidog and other artists from the People's Republic of Mongolia who were invited to visit our country and prepare for the exhibition, I had a deeper understanding and experience of the works, so I was even more moved by these works and loved these works even more.
    The themes of these works are very broad and the content is very rich. "Mao Zedong and Tsedenbal," "Giving Advice to Herdsmen," "Choibalsan in Irkutsk," "Sükhbaatar," "Choibalsan and Stalin Together," and the statues of Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan are all outstanding representative works with the theme of portraits of leaders in modern Mongolian fine art creation. These works truly and movingly express the images of the great leaders, especially their great thoughts and noble feelings of caring for the people everywhere.
    "Miners' Morning," "In the Field," "After Work," "Milking Mares," "The Crops are Ripe," "At the Construction Site," "Building Livestock Sheds," "New Female Teacher," and "Female Herdsman" are all excellent creations with the theme of expressing the peaceful construction of the Mongolian people in various fields. At the same time, the beautiful scenery of Mongolia's grasslands, mountains, and blue lakes, as well as the rich national resources, are also depicted in the paintings. We know that the various labors and struggles of the people to strive for the establishment of a new society and a new life are the richest and most vivid themes in artistic creation and the only source of truly great works. From many works in the exhibition, it can be seen that the efforts of the artists of the People's Republic of Mongolia in this regard have achieved excellent success.
    From the organized herdsmen and productive farmland to the factories and mines of socialist production, from the enthusiastic advanced workers to the criticism of the lazy and truant backward thinking, from the depiction of happy children to the elderly, no matter what kind of theme, the themes of the Mongolian artists' works are optimistic, affirmative, and positive. From the works, we see and recognize how the Mongolian people, under the correct leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, are earnestly, bravely, diligently, and full of confidence and optimism in building their own country and opposing those remaining old ideas and old habits. These works not only truly reflect life, but also educate the people with socialist ideas and encourage the people to advance victoriously.
    In terms of artistic expression, whether it is a portrait, a multi-person composition, people's labor, or a natural landscape, whether it is a large-scale creation or a small sketch, Mongolian artists pay great attention to highlighting the theme, the completeness of the structure, and the vividness of the image. Many works have moving plots, comfortable pictures, and clear ideas, which can be easily understood by the viewer. In terms of color and brushwork, the techniques are concise, the emphasis is clear, and the colors are bright. Mongolian artists are good at using contrasting primary colors to highlight the subject matter and enhance the touching effect of the works. At the same time, they are also very good at using intermediate colors and appropriate treatment of light and dark dividing lines, so that the contrasting colors and light and dark degrees are cleverly connected in a process, so that the entire picture has a sufficient sense of space and a harmonious rhythm. In this way, the painting can first arouse the viewer's aesthetic feeling, and then make him understand the ideological content of the work and receive an unforgettable education. In terms of brushwork, it is both calm and powerful, and elegant and brisk, which also adds interest to the work and helps to clarify the image and the theme.
    The works exhibited this time total more than 200 pieces (excluding small works and student works), including 28 sculptures. We can say that the structure and modeling of all the works are rigorous and complete, and can accurately explain the ideological content. These works clearly and concretely tell us that the Mongolian people since liberation have victoriously built their motherland, their lives are happy and beautiful, and they not only care about themselves, but also work together with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries in the spirit of internationalism for lasting world peace and against imperialist aggression. Among these many excellent works, the works of Dorjiin Choidog, winner of the Choibalsan Prize and meritorious artist, are very kind and moving. He expressed the theme of the meeting between Premier Tsedenbal, the leader of the Mongolian people who came to visit China, and Chairman Mao. This painting is not large, but the great spirit of the two great people's leaders of the two countries is deeply expressed. Others include Manibadar, Tsebzhab, and Yadam Süren, all of whom are winners of the Choibalsan Prize and meritorious artists. Their creations, as well as those of Chultem, Odun, Damdinsüren, Gombosüren, and sculptors Chembul and Ranzhuba, are all works with high ideological and artistic qualities. These representative works of theirs are what Chinese artists need to learn more from. Many small landscape oil paintings, although in the nature of collecting materials, are very emotional and poetic, with harmonious colors and a comfortable tone, making people feel real, kind, and lovely. The remaining secular paintings, decorative paintings, and craft patterns all show the excellent tradition of Mongolian folk art.
    This exhibition is a major event in cultural exchanges between China and Mongolia. It will not only enable artists from China and Mongolia to exchange experiences and learn from each other, but also further strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the people of China and Mongolia through this exhibition. The arrival of Comrade Choidog and the other four comrades in our country will surely play a great role in strengthening the ties between Chinese and Mongolian artists in the future.
    I wish the exhibition success! Long live the friendship between the people of China and Mongolia!

    丰富、优秀的蒙古人民美术
    ——为蒙古人民共和国美术展览会作
    中国美术家协会副主席　刘开渠
    蒙古人民共和国美术展览会，在我国首都开幕了。我国人民和我国美术家们热烈欢迎这个展览会，因为它丰富了我国人民的文化生活，给与了我国美术家一个宝贵的机会来观摩蒙古人民美术家的辉煌成就。
    当展览会的展品一件一件地从箱子里取出来的时候，我一件一件地看了，不禁深深地被它们所吸引。经应邀来我国访问和筹备展览会的蒙古人民共和国艺术家多吉因·却多克等同志介绍后，我对作品就有了更深刻的认识和体会，因而我更为这些作品所感动，更爱这些作品。
    这些作品，题材非常广泛，内容非常丰富。“毛泽东和泽登巴尔”、“向牧畜者提意见”、
  “乔巴山在伊尔库茨克”、“苏赫·巴托尔”、“乔巴山和斯大林在一起”以及苏赫·巴托尔、乔巴山的雕像等，都是蒙古人民共和国现代美术创作中以领袖像为主题的杰出的代表作品。这些作品真实动人地表现了伟大领袖们的形象，尤其是表现了他们伟大的思想和处处关心人民的高贵的感情。
  “矿工们的早晨”、“在田地里”、“工作之后”、
  “挤马奶”、“庄稼熟了”、“在建筑工地上”、
  “建筑畜棚”、“新的女教师”和“女畜牧员”等，都是以表现蒙古人民在各方面的和平建设为主题的优秀创作。同时，蒙古的草原、群山和碧蓝的湖，这些美丽的景色和丰饶的国家富源，也都被刻划在画幅上。我们知道，人民为争取建立新社会新生活的各种劳动和斗争，是艺术创作上最丰富最生动的题材，是产生真正伟大作品的唯一源泉。从展览会上的许多作品看，可以看出蒙古人民共和国的美术家们在这方面的努力都获得了优越的成功。
    蒙古美术家的作品，从表现组织起来的牧民和丰产的农田到社会主义生产的工厂、矿场，从表现热情的先进工作者到批判懒惰、旷职的落后思想，从描写幸福的儿童到年迈的老人，不管那一类的题材，其主题思想都是乐观的、肯定的和积极的。从作品里，我们看见和认识到蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的正确领导之下，他们是怎样的认真、勇敢、勤劳、充满了信心和乐观的精神，去建设他们自己的祖国，去反对那些残存的旧思想、旧习惯。这些作品，不仅做到了真实地反映了生活，同时也做到了以社会主义思想去教育人民，去鼓舞人民胜利地前进。
    就表现艺术说，不论是肖像、是多人构图、是人的劳动、是自然风景，也不论是大幅创作或是小品速写，蒙古美术家都十分注意主题思想的突出、结构的完整和形象的生动。许多作品都是情节动人，画面舒适，思想明确，能让观者一目了然。在设色用笔方面，手法简洁，轻重分明，色彩明朗。蒙古美术家在色彩上善用对比的鲜明的原色，以突出题材内容，加强作品的感人效果。同时他们又很会利用中间色和适宜的处理明暗交界线，这样便巧妙地使对比的颜色，明暗光度，有过程地连接起来，使整个画面有充足的空间感，有和谐的韵律。这样画幅就能首先引起观者的美感，进而使其体会作品的思想内容，受到不易忘怀的教育。在用笔方面，是既沉着有力，又潇洒轻快，这也就使作品增多了趣味，有助于形象的鲜明化和主题的明确。
    这次展出的作品共二百余件（小幅作品和学生作品在外），内中有雕塑二十八件。我们可以说，全部作品结构、造型都是严谨完整的，都能确切地说明思想内容。这些作品明白具体地告诉我们，解放以来的蒙古人民是胜利地建设了祖国，他们的生活是幸福和美丽的，他们不仅关心着自己，他们还以国际主义精神和苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家人民一起，为世界持久和平，反对帝国主义侵略而斗争。在这许多优秀作品中，乔巴山奖金获得者、功勋艺术家多吉因·却多克的作品是非常亲切动人的。他表现了来中国访问的蒙古人民领袖泽登巴尔总理和毛主席会见的这一题材，这幅画并不大，但两个国家的两位伟大的人民领袖的伟大精神是深刻地表现出来了。其他还有马尼巴达尔、采布格札布、亚达姆苏伦，都是乔巴山奖金获得者、功勋艺术家。他们以及楚勒图姆、奥敦、达姆金苏伦、高姆波苏伦和雕刻家却姆布尔、然巴诸家的创作，都是思想性和艺术性很高的作品。他们的这些代表作，都是中国美术家需要多多学习的。有许多小幅风景油画，虽是收集素材的性质，但却十分富有感情和诗意，色彩调和，调子舒畅，令人感到真实、亲切、可爱。其余展出的世俗画、装饰画和工艺图案，都显示出了蒙古民间美术的优秀传统。
    这个展览会在中蒙两国文化交流上是一件大事，它不仅使中蒙两国的美术家得以交换经验，互相学习，而且将通过这次展出，更进一步地加强和巩固中蒙两国人民的友谊。此次却多克同志和其他四位同志的来到我国，对今后中蒙美术家的加紧联系，必将起极大作用。
    祝展览会成功！中蒙两国人民的友谊万岁！
