    On the morning of the 15th, many cadres and soldiers from various departments of the Volunteer Army Headquarters and Political Department gathered in front of loudspeakers to listen quietly to the full text of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The workers of the Volunteer Army Political Department Printing Factory worked together to publish this issue of "Xinhua Telegraph," which contained the Draft Constitution, more than an hour ahead of schedule.

    Cadres and soldiers of various departments under the leadership organ of the Volunteer Army warmly support the Draft Constitution. Huang Yixin, the gunner of a certain anti-aircraft artillery company, said excitedly at the discussion meeting: "We resolutely support the Draft Constitution. This is a great joyous event for our motherland, the result of the heroic struggle of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in leading the people of our country for decades, and a new victory for our great motherland! We must, in accordance with Article 20 of the Draft Constitution, wholeheartedly strive to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of territorial sovereignty."
