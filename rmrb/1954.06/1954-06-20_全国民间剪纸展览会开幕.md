    National Folk Paper-cutting Exhibition Opens
    The National Folk Paper-cutting Exhibition, sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, is scheduled to open today (20th) at the Chengqian Palace in the Forbidden City, Beijing. This exhibition features more than 400 works from sixteen provinces and cities including Shandong, Shanxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hubei, and Zhejiang.
    The art of paper-cutting is popular in the vast rural areas of our country and has a long historical tradition. After liberation, many new contents were added. Paper-cutting production methods include both cutting and carving, and there are various forms. Most paper-cuttings are made by rural women. The paper-cuttings on display include vividly posed opera figures, delicate and beautiful flowers, birds, and animals that are both delicate and lively, as well as hearty northern window decorations. These works express the love of the working people of our country for their lives, and at the same time, they express their rich artistic talents.

    全国民间剪纸展览会开幕
    中国美术家协会主办的全国民间剪纸展览会，定今日（二十日）在北京故宫承乾宫开幕。这次展览，共展出山东、山西、广东、福建、湖北、浙江等十六个省、市的四百余件作品。
    剪纸艺术流行于我国广大农村，具有悠久的历史传统，解放后增加了不少新的内容。剪纸制作方法有剪、刻两种，形式多种多样。大部分剪纸都出自农村妇女之手。这次展出的剪纸中，有姿态生动的戏曲人物，有纤细秀美、生动活泼的花草鸟兽，还有风格茁实的北方窗花。这些作品表现了我国劳动人民对于自己的生活的热爱，同时表现了他们的丰富的艺术才能。
