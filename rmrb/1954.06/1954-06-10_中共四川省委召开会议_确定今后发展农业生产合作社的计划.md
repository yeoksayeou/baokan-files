The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting to determine a plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives in the future.

In the autumn and winter of this year and the spring of next year, Sichuan Province will develop another 18,000 agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of the existing 604 agricultural production cooperatives. The provincial conference on cooperative establishment work convened by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party determined that the first batch of 6,000 cooperatives will complete all preparations for establishment before the autumn harvest and will be formally established and put into production after the autumn harvest; the second batch will begin after the autumn harvest and will complete 12,000 cooperatives before the spring ploughing next year. The areas where cooperatives are established should pay attention to grasping key points and taking care of the development of the overall area. The Wenjiang Special District plans to establish five to seven cooperatives in each township in the plains area, three to five cooperatives in each township in the hilly area, and one or two pilot cooperatives in each county in the mountainous area. Next year, 430,000 farm households throughout the province will join agricultural production cooperatives, which is about 22 times the current number of households joining the cooperatives. Suining Special District and the suburbs of Chengdu can achieve having cooperatives in every township, Jiangjin and Neijiang Special Districts can have cooperatives in 80% of the townships, and other Special Districts can have cooperatives in 50% of the townships. In accordance with the policy of "active leadership and steady progress," all localities are currently stepping up the training of leading cadres for cooperative establishment and cultivating targets for cooperative establishment. The province plans to train 18,950 chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives, and 18,000 accountants and agricultural technicians each, around this autumn. Starting in June, local Party committees will transfer district-level cadres to train leading cadres, while county Party committees will train key members of the cooperative establishment targets. After the cooperative establishment targets are determined, their training will be strengthened, and Party building will be carried out in conjunction with cooperative establishment.

    中共四川省委召开会议
    确定今后发展农业生产合作社的计划
    四川省今年秋冬两季和明年春季，将在现有六百零四个农业生产合作社的基础上，再发展一万八千个农业生产合作社。中共四川省委召开的全省建社工作会议，确定第一批完成六千个，秋收前完成建社的一切准备，秋收后正式成立投入生产；第二批秋收后开始，明年春耕前完成一万二千个。建社地区注意掌握重点，并照顾面的发展。温江专区计划平坝区每乡建社五个到七个，丘陵区每乡建社三个到五个，大山区每县试办一两个。明年全省将有四十三万农户加入农业生产合作社，约为目前入社农户的二十二倍。遂宁专区、成都市郊可做到乡乡有社，江津、内江专区百分之八十乡有社，其他专区百分之五十乡有社。各地本着“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，目前正抓紧调训建社领导骨干和培养建社对象。全省计划今秋前后训练农业生产合作社社长一万八千九百五十人，会计、农业技术员各一万八千人。从六月开始各地委抽调区级干部，训练领导骨干，各县委则训练建社对象骨干。建社对象确定后，即将加强对它们的培养工作，并结合建社进行建党。　　（本报西南记者站）
