Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: According to TASS, the Security Council held a special meeting on the 20th at the request of the Guatemalan representative. The agenda included a telegram from the Guatemalan Foreign Minister on the 19th regarding aggression against Guatemala by the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua "at the instigation of certain foreign monopolies."

    Guatemalan representative Ariola spoke at the meeting, pointing out that this aggression against Guatemala was the result of an international conspiracy. Ariola spoke about the preparations for the aggression, emphasizing that US monopolies and the US State Department had carried out long-term hostile activities against Guatemala, threatening it with intervention. He reported that some American-made aircraft had bombed and strafed many Guatemalan cities and villages, and that two pilots forced to land after the air raid were found to be American pilots belonging to an expeditionary force.
    The Guatemalan representative requested the Security Council to immediately intervene in this matter, stop the aggression, send a commission of inquiry to Guatemala and its neighboring countries, and issue a warning to the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua.
    The representatives of Brazil and Colombia put forward a joint proposal suggesting that the issue raised by the Guatemalan government be submitted to the Organization of American States (an agency used by the United States to implement its policies in Latin America) for discussion. The representatives of the United States, Britain, Turkey, New Zealand, Brazil, Colombia, and France supported this joint proposal, while the French representative put forward an amendment suggesting that the Security Council should issue a request to immediately stop the actions leading to bloodshed in Guatemala.
    Soviet representative Tsarapkin accused the Brazilian-Colombian proposal of aiming to encourage the US policy of aggression and of being a serious blow to the prestige of the United Nations. He pointed out that submitting the issue of intervention in Guatemala to the Organization of American States would mean further intervention. The Security Council, acting in the spirit of the Charter, should stop the aggression, rather than evade resolving this issue as the true drafters of the Brazilian and Colombian proposal hoped.
    Due to the Soviet Union—a permanent member of the Security Council—voting against the joint proposal including the French amendment, the proposal was not passed.
    The French representative then re-submitted the following proposal: The Security Council, having urgently discussed the telegram from the Guatemalan government to the President of the Security Council, requests the immediate cessation of all actions leading to bloodshed, and recommends that all members of the United Nations, in the spirit of the Charter, not aid such actions.
    The Security Council unanimously passed this proposal.

    危地马拉代表在安理会上揭露美国侵略罪行
    苏联代表指出应本着联合国宪章精神制止侵略
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：安全理事会应危地马拉代表的要求，在二十日举行了特别会议。议程包括危地马拉外交部长十九日的关于“洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜政府在某些外国垄断企业的教唆下”对危地马拉进行侵略的电报。
    危地马拉代表阿里奥拉在会上发言，指出这次对危地马拉的侵略是国际阴谋所引起的结果。阿里奥拉讲到侵略的准备情形，他强调说，美国垄断企业和美国国务院对危地马拉进行了长期的敌意活动，向它威胁说要进行干涉。他报告说，一些美国制造的飞机向许多危地马拉城市和乡村进行了轰炸和扫射，他们发现在空袭后被强迫降落的两个驾驶员竟是属于一个远征军团的美国驾驶员。
    危地马拉代表要求安全理事会立刻过问这件事情，制止侵略，派遣一个视察委员会到危地马拉和它的邻国去，并向洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜政府提出警告。
    巴西和哥伦比亚代表提出一个联合提案，建议把危地马拉政府所提出的问题交给美洲国家组织（美国用来实行它在拉丁美洲的政策的一个机构）去讨论。美国、英国、土耳其、新西兰、巴西、哥伦比亚和法国代表支持这个联合提案，同时法国代表提出一个修正案，建议安理会应该发出立刻停止导致危地马拉流血的行动的要求。
    苏联代表查拉普金指责巴西—哥伦比亚提案的目的是鼓励美国的侵略政策，并且是对联合国威望的严重打击。他指出：把干涉危地马拉问题提交美洲国家组织便意味着进一步进行干涉。安全理事会本着宪章的精神行事，便应该制止侵略，而不要像巴西与哥伦比亚所提的提案的真正草拟人所希望的，逃避解决这个问题。
    由于苏联——安全理事会常任理事国之一——投票反对这个包括法国修正案在内的联合提案，提案未获通过。
    法国代表然后重新提出如下提案：安全理事会紧急讨论了危地马拉政府致安全理事会主席的电报，要求立刻停止导致流血的一切行动，并建议联合国所有会员国本着宪章的精神，不要援助这种行动。
    安全理事会一致通过了这个提案。
