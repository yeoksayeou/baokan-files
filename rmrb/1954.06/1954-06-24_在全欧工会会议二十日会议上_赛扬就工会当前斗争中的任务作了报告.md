Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 21st (TASS dispatch) World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Louis Saillant gave a report at the All-Europe Trade Union Conference on the agenda item "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions in the Struggle to Establish Peaceful Relations Between European Countries, to Achieve Genuine Guarantees of Security, to Fight for Peace, and to Improve the Living Standards of Working People."

    Saillant said that one of the main reasons for the current unrest in Europe is the remilitarization of revanchist and Nazi West Germany. The Paris Treaties, under the guise of the “European Defense Community” plan, in fact provide West Germany with the possibility of building twelve divisions, while West German revanchists are demanding the establishment of twenty-five or even sixty divisions. Supporters of the “European Defense Community” insist that rearming West Germany is necessary for European "security." Its purpose is to oppose other European countries, allowing West German revanchists and American imperialists to benefit. Saillant said that the "European Defense Community's" policy has created a mutually antagonistic split within Germany, undermining European unity and forming a dissected Europe comprising a limited number of countries, while the real center of such a Europe is in the United States. The economic purpose of this policy is to ensure that American financiers and industrialists can control the European economy, creating the necessary economic foundation for them to realize their aggressive plans.

    Saillant then cited examples of increased taxes and rising unemployment in European capitalist countries. He said that one of the main reasons for this situation is the establishment of the “European Coal and Steel Community,” which has intensified competition. The “European Defense Community” is further fueling the flames. Continuing to implement the so-called "unified Europe" policy will lead to the disintegration of entire industrial sectors.

    Speaking on the issue of European collective security, Saillant said that the working people and trade union organizations of European countries cannot tolerate the replacement of a solution to European collective security with the rearmament of revanchist West Germany, and they do not want a Europe controlled by arms dealers and international financiers.

    The real guarantee of European peace and security lies in the establishment of a collective security system for all European countries (regardless of their social systems), in which no one country dominates. The principles for establishing such a collective security system are:

    1.  Peace is indivisible. To make collective security a reality, it should be based on the cooperation of all European countries without exception. It requires the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems.

    2.  Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Interference aimed at preventing or inciting changes in the political system of any country should be prohibited.

    3.  Equality among all countries. Collective security should be established in such a way that no country can impose its will on other, currently weaker, contracting states. For example, the stationing of foreign troops, the establishment of foreign military bases, and the forced subordination of a country's army to foreign command are intolerable.

    4.  Consultation. If any contracting state has a dispute with other contracting states, it shall not use force to resolve the issue for its own benefit. Collective security requires seeking the resolution of disputes through peaceful means and through consultation.

    5.  Continuous and supervised disarmament. The establishment of collective security should create an atmosphere of mutual trust, allowing mutually assisting countries to substantially reduce armaments. Collective security and disarmament are inseparable.

    Saillant concluded by saying that in order to prevent the outbreak of a new world war, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions suggests:

    1.  The conference calls on all working people in Europe to take immediate action to unite in a resolute struggle against the "European Defense Community," against the remilitarization of West Germany, for European collective security, and for broad trade and peace between East and West;

    2.  The conference calls on the working people of Europe and the world to demand an immediate halt to the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to declare these weapons illegal, as they threaten the very survival of humanity. At the same time, the same appeal should be made to the American working people, charging them with fully playing their important role in the struggle against the use of atomic weapons;

    3.  To launch a movement calling for mass rallies with broad participation from foreign trade union guests to explain clearly to all working people the extent of the threat to the security of the people of Europe and the world due to the remilitarization of West Germany and the policy of dividing Europe;

    4.  To use every possibility to establish the broadest cooperation among trade union organizations of various tendencies in all countries in the struggle for bread, peace, and freedom;

    5.  To take all measures to send more delegations to each other among trade unions to enhance mutual understanding among the working people of different countries and to strengthen the great international solidarity of the workers.

### 在全欧工会会议二十日会议上  赛扬就工会当前斗争中的任务作了报告

    在全欧工会会议二十日会议上
    赛扬就工会当前斗争中的任务作了报告
    世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬在全欧工会会议上，就会议议程“工会在争取欧洲各国之间建立和平关系、争取安全的真正保证、争取和平和争取劳动人民生活水平提高的斗争中的作用和任务”作了报告。
    赛扬说，目前欧洲不安的主要原因之一是复仇主义和纳粹的西德的重新军国主义化。巴黎条约以
  “欧洲防务集团”计划为幌子，事实上替西德提供了建立十二个师的可能，西德复仇主义者却要求建立二十五个甚至六十个师。“欧洲防务集团”的拥护者硬说，重新武装西德是欧洲“安全”所必需的。它的目的是要反对其他一些欧洲国家，使西德复仇主义者和美国帝国主义者从中取利。赛扬说，“欧洲防务集团”的这种政策造成了德国内部互相对立的分裂局面，这种政策破坏了欧洲的团结和形成了一种包括有限的国家在内的被肢解了的欧洲，而这样一个欧洲的真正的中心却在美国。这种政策在经济上的目的是保证使美国的金融界和实业界人士能控制欧洲的经济，造成他们实现侵略计划的必要的经济基础。
    赛扬接着举例叙述了欧洲资本主义国家赋税增加、失业人数增多的情况。他说，造成这种情况的最主要原因之一，就是“欧洲煤钢联营集团”的成立，它加强了竞争。而“欧洲防务集团”更进一步火上加油。继续执行所谓“统一欧洲”的政策，将使整个工业部门瓦解。
    赛扬在谈到欧洲集体安全的问题时说，欧洲各国劳动人民和工会组织不能容忍以重新武装复仇主义者的西德来代替解决欧洲集体安全的问题，不要军火商人和国际大金融家所控制的那样的欧洲。
    欧洲和平与安全的真正保证是在于建立所有欧洲国家（不问其社会制度如何）的集体安全体系，在这个体系中没有任何一个国家占统治地位。这样的集体安全体系建立的原则是：
    一、和平是不可分割的。为了使集体安全成为现实，它应当建立在毫无例外的全部欧洲国家的合作的基础上。它要求社会制度不同的国家和平共处。
    二、不干涉其他国家的内政。应当取缔目的在阻止或策动改变任何国家的政治制度的干涉。
    三、各国一律平等。应该建立这样的集体安全：任何一个国家都没有可能将自己的意志强加于其他的现时比较弱的缔约国。例如，驻扎外国军队、建立外国军事基地、迫使一国的军队屈从于外国司令部等都不能容忍。
    四、协商。任何缔约国一旦与其他缔约国发生分歧，不得为了自己的利益使用武力来解决问题。集体安全要求通过和平的方法、通过协商谋求争端的解决。
    五、连续不断的、有监督的裁军。集体安全的建立应当造成一种互相信任的气氛，使互相帮助的国家大量裁减军备。集体安全和裁减军备是彼此不可分的。
    赛扬最后说道，为了阻止新的世界大战的发生，世界工联书记处建议：
    一、会议号召欧洲所有的劳动人民立即采取办法，以联合起来为反对“欧洲防务集团”、反对西德重新军国主义化、争取欧洲集体安全、争取在东西方之间的广泛的贸易来往与和平而进行坚决的斗争；
    二、会议号召欧洲和全世界的劳动人民要求立即停止继续试验原子武器与氢武器，并宣布这些武器为非法。因为它们使人类生存本身受到威胁。同时应该也向美国劳动人民发出同样的呼吁，责成他们在反对使用原子武器这一斗争中充分发挥他们本身的重要作用；
    三、发起一个运动，号召举行有工会外宾广泛参加的群众集会，以向所有的劳动人民解释清楚：由于西德的重新军国主义化和分裂欧洲的政策，对欧洲和全世界各国人民的安全产生的威胁已达到怎样的程度；
    四、利用一切可能来建立各个国家各种倾向的工会组织在为面包、和平和自由的斗争中的最广泛的合作；
    五、采取一切措施使各工会更多地互相派遣代表团，以增进各种不同国家劳动人民之间的相互了解，和加强工人的国际大团结。
