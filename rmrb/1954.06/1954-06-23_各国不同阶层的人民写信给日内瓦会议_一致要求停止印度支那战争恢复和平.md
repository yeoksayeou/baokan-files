Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 20th (By our correspondent Li Ping): The number of letters to the Geneva Conference demanding peace in Indochina is increasing. These letters come from France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, North Africa, and the United States, and the writers belong to various professions and have different political views.

In addition to receiving copies of letters written to the Geneva Conference, the Chinese delegation has also received letters praising its firm stance in upholding peace at the conference. Eight thousand five hundred and thirty workers from an aeronautical mechanical factory in Paris wrote a letter to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, expressing their respect for his unremitting efforts at the Geneva Conference to achieve peace in the Far East.

Among the letters received by the Geneva Conference, most of them came from France. This shows that the French people universally hope to end the pointless Indochina War. A group of retired railway workers and widows of railway workers wrote from Marseille, saying: "Our successive governments have consistently refused to increase our meager pensions and allowances. It is time to end this dirty war and use the huge military expenditures to improve the tragic lives of us and our compatriots." They said that only by stopping the Indochina colonial war can France restore its reputation for loving freedom and peace.

One hundred and fifty female students from a secondary school in Paris—the Fénelon Lycée—said that they opposed the continuation of the Indochina War because they did not want to see their brothers conscripted and transported to Indochina, as the Laniel government planned. They demanded that the conference achieve a ceasefire in Indochina, which should be "a prelude to lasting peace, and not a breathing space to expand the war."

The French National Federation of Prisoners of War sent the Geneva Conference a resolution passed by 450 representatives at a recent meeting, which called for a ceasefire and a political settlement of the Indochina issue.

A letter from the remote Aurès Mountains in Algeria stated that local residents met on May 24 to demand a peaceful settlement in the three Indochinese countries in accordance with the principles of national independence and self-determination.

Construction workers, housewives, writers, and peace committees from West Germany wrote letters and postcards to the Geneva Conference, demanding an agreement on the Indochina issue.

The letter from Otto, the mayor of Ochsenhausen, talked about the situation of the Swiss police driving him back to West Germany from Geneva. He brought two thousand copies of his pamphlet and originally planned to distribute them to the delegations attending the Geneva Conference. He wrote: "Peace can only be achieved by not interfering in the internal affairs of other countries."

Among the letters from Italy, one was sent from a small town in Sicily called Mazzarino. The letter said that eight thousand residents (80% of the town's total population) had just signed a declaration demanding the success of the Geneva Conference.

Some Americans wrote to the Geneva Conference expressing their opposition to American intervention in Indochina. An American from Chicago, who for obvious reasons did not write his name, said: "We oppose Secretary of State Dulles' series of steps to drag us into another war in Indochina." He enclosed a letter he had already sent to Eisenhower. This letter said: "It would be better not to send our young men to die in the jungles of Asia, but to let them live. Of course, it would be much better to send you and all your ministers in Washington to the front lines to help with the actual fighting, rather than hiding in Washington as parasites. I think this is the result of the country electing a still-warlike soldier as president."

### 各国不同阶层的人民写信给日内瓦会议  一致要求停止印度支那战争恢复和平

    各国不同阶层的人民写信给日内瓦会议
    一致要求停止印度支那战争恢复和平
    【新华社日内瓦二十日电】本社记者李平报道：写给日内瓦会议要求印度支那和平的信件越来越多了。这些信来自法国、西德、比利时、意大利、北非和美国，写信的人属于各种职业，他们具有不同的政治见解。
    中国代表团除了收到写给日内瓦会议的信件的副本以外，还收到了一些赞扬它在会议上维护和平的坚决立场的信件。巴黎一家航空机械工厂的八千五百三十名工人写了一封信给周恩来外长，对他在日内瓦会议上坚持不渝地为实现远东和平而作的努力表示敬意。
    在日内瓦会议收到的信件中，法国来信占了大部分。这说明法国人民普遍希望结束毫无好处的印度支那战争。一批退休的铁路工人和铁路工人的寡妇从马赛来信说：“我们的历届政府一直拒绝增加我们的菲薄的养老金和抚恤金。现在是结束这个肮脏战争、把巨额军事开支用来改善我们以及我们的同胞的悲惨生活的时候了。”他们说，只有停止印度支那殖民战争，法国才能恢复它的爱好自由和爱好和平的声名。
    巴黎的一所中学——费纳龙中学的一百五十个女学生说，她们反对继续印度支那战争，因为她们不愿意看到她们的兄弟被征召，并被运到印度支那去，像拉尼埃政府所计划的那样。她们要求会议实现印度支那停火，这个停火应该成为“持久和平的先声，而不应该是用来扩大战争的喘息机会”。
    法国全国战俘联合会把四百五十名代表在最近的会议上通过的决议寄给日内瓦会议，决议要求停火和印度支那问题的政治解决。
    从遥远的阿尔及利亚索利埃高原来的信说，当地居民在五月二十四日开会，要求按照民族独立和自决的原则在三个印度支那国家实现和平解决。
    西德的建筑工人、家庭妇女、作家和和平委员会写了信和明信片给日内瓦会议，要求在印度支那问题上达成协议。
    奥赫森豪森市长奥托的信谈到瑞士警察把他从日内瓦赶回西德去的情况。他带了两千份他著的小册子，本来打算分发给参加日内瓦会议的代表团。他写道：“只有不干涉其他国家人民的内政，和平才能实现。”
    来自意大利的信中，有一封是从西西里岛的一个小镇马查里诺寄来的。这封信说，八千个居民（这个镇的全部居民的百分之八十）刚在一个宣言上签了名，要求日内瓦会议成功。
    有些美国人写信给日内瓦会议，表示他们反对美国对印度支那的干涉。一个由于明显的原因而没有写名字的美国人从芝加哥来信说：“我们反对国务卿杜勒斯用来把我们引到印度支那的另一次战争中去的一连串步骤。”他随信附来他已经寄给艾森豪威尔的信。这封信说：“不要把我们的青年男儿赶到亚洲的丛林中去送死，还是让他们活下去的好。当然，要把你以及华盛顿的你的所有部长们送上前线去帮助进行实际战斗，而不是躲在华盛顿做寄生虫的话，那倒是要好得多。我想，这就是这个国家选出一个仍然好战的军人做总统所得到的结果。”
