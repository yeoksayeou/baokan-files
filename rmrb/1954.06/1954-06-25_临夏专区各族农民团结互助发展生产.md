Farmers of Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Baoan, Sala, and other ethnic groups in Linxia Special District, Gansu Province, have further strengthened and consolidated ethnic unity in agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

The Dongxiang Autonomous Region, Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region, and the four counties of Linxia, Kangle, Hezheng, and Yongjing under the jurisdiction of Linxia Special District are all areas where various ethnic groups live together or are mixed. In recent years, with the development of agricultural production, farmers of all ethnic groups in these areas have been eager to organize together, further helping each other to develop production. Therefore, from last winter to the present, the number of mutual aid teams that have been gradually developed and consolidated throughout the special district has reached more than 11,190. In addition, three agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the Guangtong Hui Autonomous Region and Linxia County. Some of these mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are composed of farmers from two or more ethnic groups. One of the agricultural production cooperatives is composed of Hui, Han, Dongxiang, and Baoan ethnic groups.

After the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups organized, they were able to take care of and respect each other in terms of life and customs. In various agricultural activities, they fully demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance and love. Some farmers of minority ethnic groups had poor farming techniques. After organizing, they quickly mastered techniques such as plowing, sowing, and weeding with the patient help of Han farmers. During the spring plowing and sowing this year, farmers of all ethnic groups also exchanged what they had for what they needed, exchanging seeds to ensure the smooth completion of spring plowing and sowing. Farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations generally overfulfilled the sowing plans for summer fields and oil crops according to the state plan. After the spring plowing, in the activities of constructing small-scale water conservancy projects, farmers of all ethnic groups helped and supported each other, repairing more than 150 channels. In order to promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among ethnic groups, they named their mutual aid teams "Unity and Mutual Aid Team" or "Fraternity Mutual Aid Team," etc. Some also named the canals or cart roads they jointly built "Unity Canal" or "Unity Road," etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    临夏专区各族农民团结互助发展生产
    甘肃省临夏专区回、汉、东乡、保安、撒拉等族农民在农业生产和互助合作运动中，进一步加强和巩固了民族团结。
    临夏专区所辖的东乡族自治区、广通回族自治区以及临夏、康乐、和政、永靖四个县，都是各民族聚居或杂居地区。几年来随着农业生产的发展，这些地区的各族农民都迫切要求共同组织起来，进一步互相帮助，发展生产。因此，全专区从去年冬季到现在，逐步发展和巩固起来的互助组已有一万一千一百九十多个。此外，在广通回族自治区和临夏县还建立了三个农业生产合作社。这些互助组和农业生产合作社，有一部分是由两个以上民族农民组成的。其中有一个农业生产合作社是由回、汉、东乡、保安四个民族组成的。
    回、汉等族农民组织起来后，在生活和风俗习惯方面，都能互相照顾和互相尊重。在各种农事活动中，充分发挥了互助友爱的精神。少数民族中有些农民耕作技术较差，组织起来之后，在汉族农民耐心帮助下，很快就掌握了犁地、撒种、锄草等技术。今年春耕播种中，各族农民还互通有无，调换籽种，使春耕播种工作顺利完成。参加互助合作组织的农民，一般都按照国家计划超额完成了夏田和油料作物的播种计划。春耕后在兴修小型水利的活动中，各族农民互相帮助和互相支援，整修了一百五十多条渠道。为了发扬民族间的团结互助精神，他们给自己的互助组取名为“团结互助组”或“友爱互助组”等。有的并把他们共同兴修的水渠或大车路定名为“团结渠”或“团结路”等。（新华社）
