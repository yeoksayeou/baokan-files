Xinhua News Agency report:

    Several old workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike discussed their thoughts on the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China."

    Lin Maoxiang (a cousin of martyr Lin Xiangqian), an activist of the Jiang’an Railway Trade Union during the "February 7th" era and now the Minister of Living, Housing, and Labor Insurance of the Zhengzhou District Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union, said: I have read the draft constitution from beginning to end several times, and I can't bear to put it down. Everything said in it is the truth, and everything is what I want to say in my heart. The purpose of our desperate struggle during the "February 7th" strike—to fight for human rights, freedom, and national independence—has now been realized. The draft constitution stipulates that our working class is the leading class of the country. Our workers must take the lead in earnestly discussing the draft constitution. I also hope that all worker brothers across the country will always remember one sentence: Strive to overfulfill the state's production plan. The word "overfulfill" is very important. To build socialism, we must not only be fast, but also as fast as possible. Building socialism is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country.

    Jiang Haishi, former vice chairman of the Zhengzhou branch of the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway during the "February 7th" era and now deputy director of the Zhengzhou "February 7th" Memorial Hall Management Office, said: After reading the draft constitution, I feel unspeakably happy. All one hundred and six articles of the draft constitution are for the people. In the past, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang repeatedly clamored for "returning power to the people," but they only clamored and did nothing. The power was always in the hands of a few of them. After liberation, our country was run by the people as masters, and now we must clearly stipulate this principle in the constitution. After reading the draft constitution, I deeply feel that the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is entirely for the people. If we support the draft constitution and support socialism, we must always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Li Quande, a daring member of the Zhengzhou railway workers during the "February 7th" era and now the vice chairman of the trade union of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, said: I am fifty-six years old this year, and I spent fifty years in the old society. In the old society, we people had never heard of a constitution, nor had we ever heard of laws that would allow us workers to discuss. In the old society, if a rich and powerful person did something that deserved to be beheaded, it would not be considered a crime. If working people were beaten to death and buried for no reason, no one would even know. Today, our draft constitution is truly for the benefit of the working people. If our working class supports the draft constitution, we must contribute all our abilities to the country and the people so that the country can reach socialism as soon as possible. This requires everyone's efforts, especially to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle.

    Liu Tong, deputy director of general affairs of the Zhengzhou branch of the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway during the "February 7th" era and now a worker in the fitter group of the Zhengzhou Rolling Stock Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, said: The content of our draft constitution is so democratic, and it even calls for the people of the whole country to discuss and make suggestions. This has never happened in thousands of years. Seeing this draft constitution, I forget the years of suffering I endured before liberation. After the "February 7th" strike, I was wanted by the reactionaries and fled outside, begging for food for many years. But no matter how much I suffered, I was determined not to surrender to the reactionaries. At that time, while begging for food, I encouraged myself, saying, "Liu Tong! Liu Tong! You are not poor! Your reputation is good, your bones are hard, and you are poor but your ambition is not!" After liberation, I returned to work on the railway. Now, seeing the draft constitution, everything I longed for day and night at that time is here, and it is more thoughtful than I thought. But our ideals have not been fully realized. Socialist construction has just begun. To achieve socialism, we still have to work hard. If we work hard now, we can enjoy more happiness in the future, and our children and grandchildren will thank us too.

    Zheng Guojun, a worker at the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot Factory of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, did propaganda work at the Zhengzhou branch of the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway during the "February 7th" strike. He said: The draft constitution is to protect the fruits of our struggle and to safeguard the interests of the working people. It is exactly what our working people want. In the old society, labor was a lowly profession, and workers were called "stinky workers," lower than others; the draft constitution stipulates that labor is a glorious thing, and we strongly support it. The state has given us the rights we deserve, and we must also fulfill our obligations. As workers, we must work better every day, not stay the same. In the past, our group only paid attention to saving materials and shortening working hours, and did not pay much attention to quality. This is actually a great waste of state property. In the future, I must play a backbone role in the group and change this situation.

    Liu Yulian, an old "February 7th" worker from the Xi'an Locomotive Depot of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, served as a picket member in the front ranks of the "February 7th" strike. After liberation, he not only obtained normal work and life, but was also promoted to director of the locomotive depot's preparation plant. During the general election in 1953, he was elected as a representative of the People's Congress of the Eighth District of Xi'an and a member of the People's Government of the Eighth District. On the day the draft constitution was announced, he excitedly said: "After reading the draft constitution in today's newspaper, I feel like a big red flower has bloomed in front of my eyes. The socialist ideals pursued by the revolutionary martyrs are being realized step by step. How can I not be happy?"

    Wu Dongshan, an old worker from the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory on the Beijing-Hankou Railway line during the "February 7th" era, is now over fifty years old. This spring, he was elected by all the factory's employees as a representative of the People's Congress of the Jiang'an District of Wuhan. On the day the draft constitution was announced, he pulled his son Hengxiang to his side and asked Hengxiang to read the draft constitution to him word by word. Wu Dongshan said: The announcement of the draft constitution is really a great happy event for the people of the whole country. The blood of the revolutionary martyrs was not shed in vain! The rights of democracy and freedom that we have been fighting for for many years are now fixed in the draft constitution. At noon on the 18th, he sat in front of the broadcaster and told his voters—all the factory's employees—in an excited voice his infinite joy after reading the draft constitution.

### “二七”老工人谈对宪法草案的感想

    “二七”老工人谈对宪法草案的感想
    据新华社讯：参加过“二七”大罢工的一些老工人，叙述他们对“中华人民共和国宪法草案”的感想。
    “二七”时代江岸铁路工会活动分子之一、现任中国铁路工会郑州区委员会生活住宅及劳动保险部部长林茂湘（林祥谦烈士的堂弟）说：我把宪法草案从头到尾看了几遍，舍不得放手。这上面说的句句是真理，句句是我心里要说的话。“二七”大罢工时我们拚命斗争的目的，争人权，争自由，争取民族独立，现在都实现了。宪法草案规定了我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级。我们工人必须带头认真讨论宪法草案。我还希望全国的工人兄弟们时刻记着一句话：努力超额完成国家生产计划。“超额”这两个字非常重要。我们建设社会主义不但要快，而且要尽量地快。建成社会主义，就是全国人民最大的幸福。
    “二七”时代京汉铁路总工会郑州分会副会长、现任郑州“二七”纪念堂管理处副主任姜海世说：我看了宪法草案，心里有说不出的高兴。宪法草案一百零六条，条条是为了人民。过去蒋介石匪帮一再嚷着“还政于民”，可是光嚷不做，政权始终操在他们少数人手里。解放后，我们的国家就由人民当家作主了，现在更要把这条原则明文规定到宪法里边。看过宪法草案，我更深深感到共产党、毛主席的领导完全是为了人民。我们拥护宪法草案，拥护社会主义，就要永远跟着共产党、毛主席走。
    “二七”时代的郑州铁路工人敢死队员、现任郑州铁路管理局郑州机务段工会副主席李全德说：我今年五十六岁了，有五十年是在旧社会过的。在旧社会，我们这些人从来没听说过宪法，也从来没听说过法律要让我们工人讨论。在旧社会，有钱有势的人作了该杀头的事也不算犯法，劳动人民无故被打死埋掉了还没人知道。今天我们的宪法草案真正是为劳动人民的利益。我们工人阶级拥护宪法草案，就要把全部能力贡献给国家和人民，使国家早日到达社会主义，这要靠大家的努力，特别要发扬艰苦奋斗的精神。
    “二七”时代京汉铁路总工会郑州分会庶务副主任、现在是郑州铁路管理局郑州车辆段钳工组的工人刘桐说：我们的宪法草案内容规定的这样民主，还叫全国人民讨论提意见，这是几千年没有过的事情。看到这个宪法草案，我就忘不了解放前我受苦的那些年月。“二七”罢工以后，我被反动派通辑，逃在外边，讨了好多年的饭。但是无论怎样受苦，我立志不向反动派屈服。那时我一面讨饭，一面鼓励自己说：“刘桐！刘桐！你不穷！你的名誉好，你的骨头硬，你人穷志不穷！”解放后，我才又回到铁路上了工。现在看到宪法草案，凡是那时候我日夜盼望的东西，现在都有了，而且比我想的周到得多。可是我们的理想还没有完全实现。现在社会主义建设才刚刚开头。要达到社会主义，还得艰苦奋斗。我们现在艰苦奋斗，将来就可以多享些幸福，子子孙孙也都会感谢我们。
    郑州铁路管理局郑州机务段工厂的工人郑国钧在“二七”罢工时在京汉铁路总工会郑州分会做宣传工作。他说：宪法草案是为了保护我们的斗争胜利果实，是为了保障劳动人民利益，正合我们劳动人民的心意。在旧社会，劳动是下贱的职业，工人被叫作“臭工人”，比人低一头；宪法草案规定了劳动是光荣的事情，我们非常拥护。国家给了我们应有的权利，我们也必须尽到自己的义务。我们做工人的干活必得一天比一天干得好，不能老样子。我们小组里过去干活光注意节省材料、缩短工时，不大注意质量，这实际上也是对国家财产的很大浪费。今后我一定要在小组里起骨干作用，改变这种情况。
    郑州铁路管理局西安机务段的“二七”老工人刘玉琏，在“二七”大罢工时曾站在队伍前列担任着纠察员的职务。解放后，他不仅获得了正常的工作、生活，而且被提升为机务段整备厂的主任。一九五三年普选时，他被选为西安市第八区人民代表大会的代表和第八区人民政府的委员。在宪法草案公布的当天，他兴奋地说：“看了今天报上的宪法草案，我眼前就像开放了一朵大红花，革命先烈们追求的社会主义理想正一步步地实现了，我怎能不高兴呢？”
    “二七”时代京汉铁路线上江岸机车车辆修理工厂的老工人吴东山，现在已经五十多岁了。今年春天，他被全厂职工选举为武汉市江岸区人民代表大会的代表。宪法草案公布的那一天，他把儿子恒祥拉到跟前，叫恒祥把宪法草案逐字逐句念给他听。吴东山说：宪法草案公布了，真是全国人民一桩大喜事，革命烈士的血没有白流！我们多少年来所争取的民主自由的权利，现在都在宪法草案上固定下来了。十八日中午，他坐在播音器前，用激动的声音把他读了宪法草案后无限喜悦的心情告诉了他的选民——全厂职工。
