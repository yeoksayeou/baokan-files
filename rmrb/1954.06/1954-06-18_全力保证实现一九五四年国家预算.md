The 31st meeting of the Central People's Government Committee approved the 1954 National Budget Report. This budget vividly records the brilliant achievements of our people in the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, and fully reflects the ardent desire of our people to further develop the national economy, improve the people's welfare, and consolidate national defense in 1954. This is a constructive budget for peaceful economic development. The task of the people of the whole country is to transform the enthusiasm for construction and the desire for peace into the power of action, and to make every effort to ensure the implementation of the 1954 National Budget.

A prominent feature of our national budget is that it is built on a solid foundation of national economic development and continuously promotes national economic growth. Both the budget revenue and budget expenditure this year have increased significantly compared to 1953, which fully demonstrates the healthy development of China's economy. In the budget expenditure, the allocation for economic construction in 1954 is more than any other year, amounting to more than 110 trillion yuan, which is six and a half times that of 1950. This part of the allocation is mainly used for investment in capital construction, with investment in heavy industry taking the lead. This further illustrates the highly constructive nature of China's finance. The principle of budget expenditure is to concentrate the use of funds to build socialist industry, and correspondingly develop agriculture, commerce, and transportation. It fully meets the requirements of the general task during the transition period and the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. All sectors of the national economy must ensure that every penny of investment in the budget plays its role in accordance with the state plan. If this is achieved, the national economy in 1954 will be further developed, and the total output value of industry and agriculture will increase by 12.6 percent compared with 1953. The speed of China's economic development is undoubtedly beyond the reach of capitalist countries.

The purpose of developing production is to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people. This is the law of socialist economics. The 1954 National Budget not only reflects the development of China's economy and the growth of socialist elements, but also reflects the state's concern for culture, education, science, health, and social welfare. This year's expenditure on social, cultural, and educational affairs increased by 15.2 percent compared with last year, which is more than the total amount of social, cultural, and educational appropriations in 1951 and 1952. In addition, the average wage of employees in state-owned enterprises, cultural and educational departments, and state organs will increase by 5.2 percent this year, and social purchasing power will increase by 13.8 percent. These provisions of the national budget will inevitably be widely supported by the people of the whole country, and will greatly stimulate labor production enthusiasm and further promote the country's various construction undertakings.

Of course, the development of national construction and the improvement of people's living standards require a peaceful and safe environment, which requires us to continue to strengthen our national defense forces to defend our peaceful life. We must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the war policies of the warmongering elements of American imperialism and their actions hostile to our country. The 1954 budget stipulates that national defense expenditure accounts for 21.11 percent of the total expenditure, which is absolutely necessary.

The foundation of the 1954 budget is indeed reliable, and the guidelines are completely correct. The distribution ratio of budget revenue and expenditure fully demonstrates the superiority of China's people's democratic system. The implementation of this budget will further bring great benefits to the people of our country. However, we must not think that there are no shortcomings and difficulties, let alone that the remaining problem is only how the financial departments should control revenue and expenditure according to the plan and has nothing to do with the people as a whole. Such a view is obviously incorrect. The 1954 budget is solid, and the implementation in the past five months has also been good, but we must understand that some new investments may often have to be increased in large-scale economic construction, and we must also prevent the attacks of certain natural disasters at any time, and we may also encounter some difficulties in credit planning and cash turnover. Therefore, we must never take a carefree attitude towards the implementation of the budget. Since the national budget reflects the activities of the entire national economy, it is closely related to everyone. Therefore, all our state organs, enterprise departments, employees of cultural and educational units, and all the people have the responsibility to supervise the implementation of the budget and ensure the realization of the budget; and they also have the responsibility to overcome all possible difficulties. Only in this way can the victorious realization of the national budget be reliably guaranteed.

The important key to ensuring the realization of the 1954 National Budget lies in comprehensively fulfilling and over-fulfilling the 1954 National Economic Plan, which is the foundation of the National Budget. Up to now, many enterprises and units still have insufficient understanding of the important significance of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan, and cannot complete the plan on a monthly or quarterly basis; or although they have completed the total output value plan, they have not comprehensively completed the financial cost, profit delivery, and labor productivity improvement plans, which will inevitably affect the national budget. As for the scattered rural economy, although it is difficult to formulate accurate plans, it is also necessary to educate farmers to recognize the importance of planning and guide them to develop production in accordance with the requirements of the state. If agricultural and sideline production cannot meet the needs of the country, such as the fact that the national cotton planting area is 1% less than the plan, more than 10,000 tons of cotton will be produced less, and more than 50,000 spindles will not be able to obtain raw materials; if each township (village) in the country raises one less pig, more than 200,000 fewer pigs will be produced, which will make millions of people feel that the supply of meat is insufficient. It can be seen from this how important it is to complete production according to plan for increasing national wealth, developing the national economy, and meeting the consumption needs of the people.

Another positive and important step to ensure the realization of the national budget is to practice strict economy. This is an important method for the state to accumulate industrialization funds and continuously enrich the state's financial reserves. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Increasing production, practicing economy, and leaving more reserves are the three reliable lines of defense for consolidating the national budget." This is the guiding principle that must be implemented in financial work in the future. At present, there are many ways for us to save money, such as streamlining state administrative organs, reducing miscellaneous expenses of economic departments, improving product quality, implementing economic accounting systems, reducing production costs, rationally using state funds, and overcoming extravagance and waste, which can save a lot of wealth for the state. According to the 1954 plan, if the commodities produced by state-owned and local state-owned industries complete the plan to reduce costs, they can save more than 4 trillion yuan of funds for the state; if state-owned commercial departments complete the plan to reduce commodity circulation costs, they can save trillions of yuan of funds; if the construction and installation costs in various basic construction projects across the country can be reduced by 8%, they can also save trillions of yuan of funds for the state. These show that the potential and possibility of saving are very huge.

However, according to the inspection of many departments, the phenomena of large administrative institutions, stockpiling of state funds, and low product and construction quality are still very serious. This shows that our enterprise management work is still far behind the requirements of national construction. For example, the proportion of non-production personnel in many central economic departments has increased compared with the past; some departments have increased personnel, but the workload has not increased, resulting in overstaffing; some departments have poor work order, resulting in uneven workload, or although they all have dedicated responsibilities, their work efficiency is not high. Effective measures must be taken to change these phenomena. The phenomenon of waste in the use of state funds by some enterprise departments must also be overcome. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the third quarter of last year, the actual reserve funds of various production departments exceeded the plan by about 30%; about 10% of the appropriations for basic construction throughout the year were invested in idle and stockpiled materials and equipment. This made a large amount of funds not play a role in the current year. In the expenditure of operating expenses and construction expenses of other departments, unreasonable or not entirely reasonable waste phenomena are by no means in the minority. We must fight against all phenomena that violate the principle of thrift.

To ensure the realization of the 1954 National Budget, it is also necessary to strengthen financial supervision and resolutely oppose various behaviors that undermine the financial system and financial discipline. At present, the phenomenon of violating financial discipline in state-owned enterprises is still very common; the phenomenon of tax evasion and avoidance in private industrial and commercial households is also quite serious. As a result, either the budget expenditure is wasted, or the income is reduced. In either case, the national budget will suffer losses. Last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry inspected 54 construction units and found that 20 of them had experienced varying degrees of violations of financial discipline: some used start-up funds to purchase cameras, some used transportation expenses to purchase loudspeakers; some units retained surplus and disposed of it privately. They found that a factory in the Northeast had extremely chaotic financial work, and built temporary sheds without approval, and the cost was extremely high. Among them, only more than 20,000 square meters of buildings exceeded the general quota by 48 billion yuan; they did not pay attention to the economic accounting system, and the winter construction cost exceeded the plan by 4 billion yuan; new quilts were used as insulation equipment, which cost more than 500 million yuan; the company manager did not handle affairs according to the system, and casually approved 26 million yuan when celebrating the "May 1" Labor Day. The workers were extremely dissatisfied with this situation and said that this factory was "rich in money and people, and gold was paved everywhere." The Ministry of Heavy Industry checked out these problems, proving that it still paid more attention to financial work and financial supervision. As for those departments that do not pay attention to financial work and do not pay attention to work inspection, the severity of the situation is completely conceivable. Therefore, we must never tolerate the behavior of undermining financial discipline and wasting state funds, and we must check and supervise it. The budget report stipulates that strengthening financial supervision should be one of the important tasks of this year, which is completely correct. All state administrative organs, financial and economic enterprises and institutions, and all employees should warmly welcome this supervision, support and help the supervision work.

The 1954 National Budget is of great significance to the national economy. Correctly implementing this budget will promote the further development of China's construction undertakings in all aspects. All the people must exert all their strength to ensure the victorious realization of this budget.

### 全力保证实现一九五四年国家预算

    全力保证实现一九五四年国家预算
    中央人民政府委员会第三十一次会议批准了一九五四年国家预算报告。这个预算生动地记载了我国人民在第一个五年计划第一年度中所取得的光辉成就，也充分地反映了我国人民在一九五四年进一步发展国民经济、增进人民福利和巩固国防力量的热烈愿望。这是一个建设性的和平发展经济的预算。全国人民的任务，就是要把建设的热情及和平的愿望变为行动的力量，尽一切努力保证一九五四年国家预算的贯彻实现。
    我国国家预算的显著特征，在于它是建立在国民经济发展的稳固基础上而又不断促进着国民经济的增长。今年的预算收入和预算支出，都比一九五三年有不少的增加，这充分说明了我国经济健康发展的状况。在预算支出中，一九五四年经济建设的拨款比任何一年都多，实数达一百一十多万亿元，为一九五○年的六倍半。这部分拨款，主要用于基本建设的投资，其中又以重工业的投资占居首位。这又说明了我国的财政带着高度的建设性。预算支出的原则就是集中使用资金来建设社会主义的工业，相应地发展农业、商业和交通运输业，它完全符合过渡时期总任务的要求和全国人民的根本利益。国民经济各部门必须按照国家计划使预算中的每一文投资都发挥它的作用。作到这一点，一九五四年的国民经济就会得到进一步的发展，工农业总产值就将比一九五三年增长百分之十二点六。我国经济发展的速度，无疑地是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。
    发展生产的目的是为了满足人民日益增长的物质和文化的要求，这是社会主义经济的法则。在一九五四年的国家预算中，不仅反映了我国经济的发展和社会主义因素的增长，也反映了国家对文化、教育、科学、卫生和社会福利事业的关怀。今年预算中社会文教费的支出，比去年增长百分之十五点二，比一九五一年和一九五二年两年社会文教拨款的总额还多。此外，今年国营企业职工、文教部门和国家机关人员的平均工资将提高百分之五点二，社会购买力将提高百分之十三点八。国家预算的这些规定，必然会得到全国人民的广泛拥护，必然会大大地激发劳动生产热情，把国家各种建设事业推进一步。
      当然，国家建设的发展和人民生活的改善，都需要有一个和平安全的环境，这就必须继续加强我国国防力量，来保卫和平的生活。对于美帝国主义好战分子的战争政策和敌视我国的行动，我们必须随时保持着高度的警惕。一九五四年的预算规定了国防费支出占总支出的百分之二十一点一一，这是完全必要的。
      一九五四年预算的基础是确实可靠的，方针是完全正确的。预算收支的分配比例，充分说明了我国人民民主制度的优越性。实现这个预算，就将进
  一步为我国人民带来巨大的利益。但是决不能认为这就没有缺点和困难了，更不能认为剩下的问题只是财政部门如何按计划掌握收支而和全体人民无关了。这样的看法显然是不正确的。一九五四年预算是巩固的，过去五个月的执行情况，也是良好的，但是，必须了解，在大规模经济建设中常常可能要增加一些新的投资，我们还必须随时预防某些自然灾害的袭击，而我们在信贷计划和现金周转方面，也还可能遇到一些困难。因此，对于预算的执行，我们决不能抱着万事大吉的态度。国家的预算既然是反映了全部国民经济的活动，这就和所有的人都发生着密切的关系，因此，所有我们的国家机关、企业部门、文化教育单位的职工以及全体人民，都有责任监督预算的执行，保证预算的实现；也都有责任来克服一切可能产生的困难。只有这样，国家预算的胜利实现才有可靠的保障。
    保证实现一九五四年国家预算的重要关键，在于全面地完成和超额完成一九五四年的国民经济计划，这是国家预算的基础。直到目前为止，还有不少企业单位对全面完成国家计划的重要意义认识不足，不能按月按季完成计划；或者虽然完成了生产总值计划，却没有全面完成财务成本、上缴利润和提高劳动生产率的计划，这对国家预算是不会没有影响的。至于分散的农村经济，虽然难于制订准确的计划，但也必须教育农民认识计划的重要，引导他们按照国家的要求发展生产。假若农副业生产不能适应国家的需要，如全国棉田播种面积比计划少百分之一，就要少产一万多吨棉花，就要使五万多纱锭得不到原料；全国每个乡（村）少养一条猪，就要少产二十多万头猪，就将使成百万人口感到肉类供应不足。由此可见，按计划完成生产，对于增加国家财富、发展国民经济和满足人民消费需要有着多么重要的意义。
    保证实现国家预算的另一个积极的重要步骤，就是要厉行节约。这是国家积累工业化资金和不断充实国家财政后备力量的重要方法。毛主席指示我们：“增产、节约、多留后备力量，是巩固国家预算的可靠的三道防线。”这是今后财政工作必须贯彻的方针。目前我们节约的道路是很多的，比如精简国家行政机构，缩减经济部门的杂费开支，提高产品质量、贯彻经济核算制、降低生产成本，合理使用国家资金，克服铺张浪费现象等，都可以为国家节约大量的财富。根据一九五四年的计划，国营及地方国营工业生产的商品如果完成了降低成本的计划，就可以为国家节约四万亿元以上的资金；国营商业部门如果完成降低商品流通费用计划，就可以节约数万亿元的资金；全国各项基本建设中的施工安装费用，如果能够争取降低百分之八，也能为国家节约几万亿元的资金，这些就说明了节约的潜力和可能性是十分巨大的。
    但是，根据许多部门的检查，行政机构庞大，积压国家资金，以及产品和施工质量低劣等现象仍然很严重。这说明了我们的企业管理工作还远远落后于国家建设的要求。例如中央不少经济部门非生产人员的比重比过去还有增加；有些部门人员增加了，工作并没有增加，结果人浮于事；有些部门工作秩序不良，以致忙闲不均，或者虽然都有专责但工作效率不高。对于这种种现象必须采取有效措施加以改变。有些企业部门在使用国家资金上的浪费现象也必须克服。根据重工业部去年第三季度统计，各生产部门实际储备资金超过计划百分之三十左右；全年基本建设的拨款，约有百分之十投入了闲置和积压的材料设备中。这就使大量的资金没有在当年发生作用。在其他部门的事业费用和建设费用的开支上，不合理或不尽合理的浪费现象也决不在少数。我们必须和一切违反节约原则的现象作斗争。
    要保证一九五四年国家预算的实现，还必须加强财政监督，坚决反对各种破坏财政制度和财政纪律的行为。目前在国家企业中违反财政纪律的现象还很普遍；在私营工商业户中偷税漏税现象也还相当严重。结果或者是使预算的开支浪费，或者是使收入减少。无论是那种情况，都会使国家预算遭到损失。重工业部去年检查了五十四个建设单位，就发现其中有二十个单位曾经发生过程度不同的违犯财政纪律的事情：有的用开办费购买照像机，有的用运输费购买扩音机；有的单位将盈余扣留私自处理。他们发现东北的一个工厂，财务工作极端混乱，不经批准就增建临时工棚，而且造价极高，其中只二万多平方公尺的建筑，就比一般定额超过四十八亿元；不讲求经济核算制度，冬季施工费用超过计划四十亿；用新棉被作保温设备，只这一项就花费五亿多元；公司经理不按制度办事，庆祝“五一”劳动节时随手批用二千六百万元。工人们对这种情况极为不满，说这个工厂是“钱多人多，到处黄金铺地”。重工业部检查出了这些问题，证明它还是比较注意财务工作和财政监督的，至于那些不注意财务工作和不注意工作检查的部门，其严重的程度，是完全可以想见的。所以，我们对于破坏财政纪律、浪费国家资金的行为，是万万不能容忍的，一定要加以检查和监督。预算报告中规定了本年度应以加强财政监督为重要任务之一，这是完全正确的。一切国家行政机关、财经企业和事业部门以及全体职工，都应该热烈地欢迎这种监督，支持和帮助监督工作的进行。
    一九五四年的国家预算，对于国民经济具有重大的意义。正确地执行这个预算，将促进我国各方面建设事业的进一步发展。全体人民必须发挥一切力量，保证这个预算的胜利实现。
