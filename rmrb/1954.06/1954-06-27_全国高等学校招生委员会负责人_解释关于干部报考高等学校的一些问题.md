Xinhua News Agency, June 26th: Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Guaranteeing the Completion of the 1954 National College Enrollment Plan" to Party committees at all levels on May 20th, young cadres across the country who meet the application requirements have enthusiastically applied for the entrance examinations with the approval of their respective organizations. Among them are many in-service cadres with years of revolutionary experience. However, due to the relatively late allocation of quotas for cadres applying for the entrance examinations, many cadres were afraid of missing the original application deadline set by local enrollment institutions. Some people also raised other questions regarding cadres applying for the entrance examinations. The person in charge of the National College Entrance Examination Committee now explains: In order to allow approved cadres to catch up with the application procedures, without affecting the examination date of July 15th, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government has instructed local enrollment institutions to uniformly extend the application deadline for in-service cadres to July 5th. The cadres selected for the entrance examinations are not limited to the quotas already allocated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Units without allocated selection quotas or those with eligible cadres in addition to the allocated quotas are still welcome to apply with the approval of their respective organizations. The phrase "selected from young cadres in Party, government, and people's organizations at and above the county level throughout the country according to the prescribed conditions" in the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China refers to in-service cadres in organizations at and above the county level. Some people think that only cadres at the county level or above can apply for the entrance examinations, which is incorrect. The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China fully embodies the deep concern of the Communist Party and the People's Government for cultivating and improving young cadres. It is hoped that in-service cadres applying for the entrance examinations will model compliance with the enrollment system, correctly choose their college aspirations based on the overall needs of the country's socialist construction and in combination with their personal experiences and expertise; after being admitted, they should consciously obey the state's allocation and report for enrollment on time; those who are not admitted should work even better in their original organizations; and it is not permissible to be admitted but refuse the state's planned allocation.

    全国高等学校招生委员会负责人
    解释关于干部报考高等学校的一些问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】中共中央自五月二十日向各级党委发出“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”以后，全国各地合乎报考条件的青年干部，经所在机关批准，踊跃报考。其中有不少是有多年革命经历的在职干部。但是由于报考干部的名额分配较迟，有不少干部怕赶不上各地招生机构原订申请报考日期，也有一些人提出了干部报考的其他一些问题。现据全国高等学校招生委员会负责人解释：为了使批准报考的干部能赶上办理报考手续，在不影响七月十五日考期的情况下，中央人民政府高等教育部已指示各地招生机构统一将在职干部申请报考的日期延期到七月五日。选送报考的干部并不限于中共中央已经分配的名额，没有分配选送名额的单位或除分配名额外还有合乎条件的干部，经过所在机关批准，仍欢迎报考。中共中央的决定中所指“从全国县以上各级党、政、人民团体等各机关青年干部中按规定条件选送”，这是指县以上各级机关的在职干部，有人认为是指县级以上的干部才能报考，是不对的。中共中央的决定充分体现了共产党和人民政府对于培养提高青年干部的深切关怀，希望报考的在职干部，模范地遵守招生制度，根据祖国社会主义建设的全面需要结合个人的经历、专长，正确地选择升学志愿；考试录取后应该自觉地服从国家分配，按期报到入学；未考取的，应该更好地在原机关工作；考取而不服从国家计划分配是不能允许的。
