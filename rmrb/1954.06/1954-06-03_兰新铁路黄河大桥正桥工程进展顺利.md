Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd. The north and south abutment bodies of the main bridge of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge have risen from the bottom of the Yellow River; the foundations of two bridge piers have also been laid. On the construction site, dozens of large and small machines have replaced manual labor in a series of processes such as lifting, transporting, and pouring concrete. The bridge project is progressing smoothly.

　　April and May are the low-water season for the Yellow River, but the mainstream water velocity is still about two meters per second, much faster than many major rivers in our country. Because the crane operators inserted the steel sheet piles very straight and closed them very accurately, the turbulent flow was subdued, and it had to flow to both sides when it encountered the steel sheet piles. The circle formed by the steel sheet piles has a diameter of more than ten meters, and the filled sand and soil are about one meter above the water surface, becoming a "small island" in the middle of the Yellow River, ensuring construction safety.

　　The bridge engineering team of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, which is building the main bridge of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Yellow River Bridge, launched a labor competition since the official start of construction on April 1, and put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals. Most of these rationalization proposals revolve around key issues such as how to drive steel sheet piles in the rapid flow of the Yellow River and how to improve the quality of concrete. Labor models Li Sanbao, Xu Jiafu, and others, under the guidance of engineers, collectively created a "turntable pile driver," which made the steel sheet piles inserted very accurately, shortened the construction period, and saved more than 40 million yuan. Old worker Yang Yunsheng advocated "double-layer digging bottom burlap cofferdam" to prevent a large amount of water leakage during the excavation of the foundation, and saved three large water pumps, saving about 12 million yuan in machine usage fees. The workers also created a "wing-shaped steam lifter," which can lift 15 tons at a time, and is more stable than ordinary cranes when operating on a boat, greatly reducing the difficulty of water transportation and lifting. Due to the coordinated and meticulous work of various types of work according to the operation plan instruction chart and construction regulations, the quality of the project has also been significantly improved.

    兰新铁路黄河大桥正桥工程进展顺利
   【新华社兰州二日电】兰新铁路黄河大桥正桥的南北两座桥台台身，已经从黄河底层上矗立起来；有两座桥墩的基础也已经打好了。工地上，数十台大型机器和小型机械，代替了起重、运输、灌注混凝土等一系列工序中的体力劳动。大桥工程正在顺利地进行着。
    四、五月里，是黄河小水季节，但水流速度主流每秒钟仍在两公尺左右，比我国许多大河的流速快得多。由于起重工人把钢板桩插得很直，合拢很准确，湍急的流水被制服了，它碰到钢板桩只得向两侧流去。钢板桩围成的圆圈内直径有十多公尺，填进去的砂土高出水面约一公尺，成了黄河中间的一座“小岛”，施工安全得到保障。
    修建兰新铁路黄河大桥正桥的中央人民政府铁道部第一工程局桥梁工程队，从四月一日正式施工以来就展开了劳动竞赛，提出了四十多件合理化建议。这些合理化建议多数是围绕着在黄河急流中怎样打好钢板桩、怎样提高混凝土质量等关键问题提出的。劳动模范李三保、徐家富等在工程师指导下，集体创造了“转盘打桩架”，使钢板桩插得很准确，并缩短了工期，节省四千多万元。老工人杨运生倡议“双层挖底麻袋围堰”，防止了在挖基当中大量漏水现象，并省出三部大型抽水机，节省机器使用费约一千二百万元。工人们还创造了“翼形蒸汽起重器”，这种起重器每次能起重十五吨，在船上操作比一般吊车更加稳当，大大减少了水上搬运和起重的困难。由于各工种按照作业计划指示图表和施工规程协同一致地精工细作，工程质量方面也有显著提高。
