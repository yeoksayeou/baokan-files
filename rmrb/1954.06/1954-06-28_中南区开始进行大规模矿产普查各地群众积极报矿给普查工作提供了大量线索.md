Large-Scale Mineral Survey Begins in Central South China
People in Various Regions Actively Report Mineral Deposits, Providing a Wealth of Clues for the Survey Work
    According to the Central Geological Department's deployment of mineral surveys, a large-scale mineral survey has begun in the Central South region.
    The Central South region is rich in mineral resources. This year's survey focuses on coal, lead, zinc, manganese, and copper, and the scale of the survey is very large. The mineral survey targets of Team 451 alone include eight kinds, such as iron, copper, lead, and zinc; the survey area of the Yuxi Coalfield Team covers as many as nine counties. The main force undertaking the mineral survey in the Central South region is the teachers and graduating students of the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Northeast Institute of Geology, and Huainan Coal Mining College. The Central South Geological Bureau has also transferred a group of technical and administrative cadres to participate and specifically lead the mineral survey work in the entire region.
    This year's mineral survey in the Central South region aims to find urgently needed minerals and provide mineral raw material bases for the country's long-term construction. Therefore, the survey teams will conduct comprehensive surveys in the Funiu Mountains, peripheral surveys in existing exploration mining areas such as Taolin, and reconnaissance surveys in northeastern Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places. The complete completion of these tasks is of great significance in meeting the country's urgent needs for coking coal, non-ferrous metals, and ferrous metals, and may discover more and better reserve bases for mineral raw materials.
    In order to do a good job in the mineral survey work in the entire region, the Central South Geological Bureau held its first mineral survey conference in early June, and representatives from the Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi Provincial Finance and Economic Committees also participated. Teachers and students participating in the survey work also made preparations for internships at their respective schools before departure and studied the survey design.
    Currently, teachers and students from the Northeast and East China schools who are responsible for the Central South mineral survey have concentrated in Xuchang and then departed for designated work areas north of the Yangtze River. Teachers and students from the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy who are participating in the survey are also departing from Changsha one after another to various survey areas south of the Yangtze River.

    The number of mineral reports from the masses in various parts of Central South China is increasing, providing the country with a large amount of valuable mineral information.
    The Central South Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government received 329 letters reporting mineral deposits last year. The number of letters reporting mineral deposits in the first five months of this year is equivalent to 81 percent of the total for last year. In the seventeen months from last year to May of this year, the letters reporting mineral deposits provided information on more than 2,000 mineral sites. The reported minerals include 25 major minerals such as coal, iron, and copper, which are of great help to this year's mineral survey. The people reporting mineral deposits include farmers and workers, soldiers guarding the frontier, as well as teenagers and elderly people in their sixties. Many people collected mineral specimens and drew simple maps of the mining areas and sent them to the geological departments.
    Many people who reported mineral deposits showed a high degree of patriotism, reflecting their deep concern and active support for the country's socialist industrial construction. Li Lianhe (Zhuang nationality), a farmer in Wuming County, Guangxi, discovered copper, manganese, and other minerals in the Daming Mountains. At that time, he did not know how to report the minerals, so he put the ore into an envelope and tried to mail it to Wuhan. After receiving the letter, the Central South Geological Bureau immediately replied, and he contacted several farmers in the local area to send the successively discovered ores to the Geological Bureau. Li Wenbai from Zhenping County, Henan Province, has often gone deep into the nearby mountains to find minerals since the year before last. He overcame many difficulties and found a variety of useful minerals in the area of ​​one or two hundred miles around Zhenping and Neixiang, providing many clues for this year's survey. The copper mine reported by Chen Zaili, a teacher at Wuchang Fifteenth Elementary School, was preliminarily investigated by the Central South Geological Bureau and believed to be a copper mining area with industrial value.

    In the Southwest region, the number of mineral reports from the people of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces increased month by month. In January of this year, the Southwest Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government received 57 letters reporting mineral deposits, and in May, it received 111 letters. In the five months of this year, a total of 911 letters were received, equivalent to 82.2 percent of the letters received throughout last year.
    In these five months, the mineral information provided by the masses involved more than 1,300 mineral sites, including 138 iron ore sites, 57 coal mine sites, and 12 oil sites. Among these mineral reporting materials, many have been identified as clues for this year's survey, and some iron ore mines have already begun to be surveyed.

    中南区开始进行大规模矿产普查
    各地群众积极报矿给普查工作提供了大量线索
    根据中央地质部开展矿产普查的部署，中南区已开始进行大规模矿产普查。
    中南矿藏十分丰富，今年普查以煤、铅、锌、锰、铜为主，普查的规模很大。仅四五一队的普查矿产对象就有铁、铜、铅、锌等八种；豫西煤田队的普查范围达九县之广。担任中南区矿产普查的主要力量是中南矿冶学院、东北地质学院、淮南煤矿专科学校的教师与应届毕业学生；中南地质局也抽调了一批技术干部和行政干部参加，并具体领导全区矿产普查工作。
    中南区今年的矿产普查一方面是寻找目前迫切需要的矿产，另一方面还要为国家长远建设提供矿产原料基地。因此，普查队要分别在伏牛山区进行综合性普查，在桃林等现有勘探矿区作外围普查，在赣东北、湖南等地作检查性普查。这些任务的全部完成，在满足国家对炼焦煤、有色金属、黑色金属的迫切需要上具有重要意义，并可能发现更多、更好的矿产原料后备地。
    为了做好全区矿产普查工作，中南地质局已于六月上旬召开了第一次矿产普查会议，河南、湖南、江西、广西四省财经委员会也派人参加。参加普查工作的教师、学生，在未出发前也分别在各校作好了实习的准备工作，并研究了普查设计书。
    目前，担任中南矿产普查的东北、华东两校师生，已在许昌集中后分赴长江以北各指定工作地区。中南矿冶学院参加普查的教师、学生也由长沙陆续出发到长江以南各普查地区。

    中南各地群众报矿日益增多，为国家提供了大量的宝贵的矿产情报。
    中央人民政府地质部中南地质局去年收到群众报矿信件三百二十九件，今年头五个月中的报矿信件就相当于去年全年的百分之八十一。从去年到今年五月的十七个月中，报矿信件总计提供了两千多处矿产情报。所报的矿包括煤、铁、铜等二十五种主要矿产，对今年的矿产普查有很大帮助。报矿群众中有农民和工人，有保卫边疆的战士，也有十几岁的小学生和六十多岁的老人。很多人采集了矿石标本，绘制了矿区简图寄给地质部门。
    许多报矿的群众表现了高度的爱国热情，反映了他们对国家的社会主义工业建设的深切关怀和积极支持。广西武鸣县农民李联合（僮族），在大明山中发现了铜、锰等矿，当时他不知怎样报矿，便将矿石装入信封试寄武汉。中南地质局收到后立即复信，他又在当地联系几个农民把陆续发现的矿石寄给地质局。河南镇平县李文白从前年就经常深入附近山中找矿。他克服了许多困难，在镇平、内乡一带纵横一、二百里的地区内找到多种有用矿物，给今年普查提供了很多线索。武昌第十五小学教师陈再厉报告的某地的铜矿，经中南地质局初步调查，认为可能是具有工业价值的铜矿区。

    西南区四川、云南、贵州、西康等省人民群众报矿的一月比一月多。今年一月份，中央人民政府地质部西南地质局收到的群众报矿信是五十七件，五月份收到了一百十一件。今年五个月内共计收到九百十一件，相当于去年全年收到报矿信件的百分之八十二点二。
    这五个月内群众报矿所提供的矿产情报地有一千三百多处，其中铁矿一百三十八处，煤矿五十七处，石油十二处。在这些报矿资料中，有许多已被确定为今年普查的线索，有的铁矿并已开始普查。
