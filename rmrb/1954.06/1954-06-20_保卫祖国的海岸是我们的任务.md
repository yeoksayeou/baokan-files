    Defending the Coast of the Motherland is Our Task
    People's Navy Soldier Song Sihui
    On June 15th, I heard that the draft constitution was going to be announced. On this day, in our office, whenever we heard the door open, everyone would invariably turn around to see if the newspaper had arrived. At ten o'clock in the morning, the door opened with a crash, and the comrade delivering the newspaper walked in with a joyful face. Everyone jumped up and surrounded him, vying to read the paper. Comrade Zhou Qinsheng took the newspaper first, spread his hands, and said, "Comrades, quiet down!" He moved a chair, sat down among us, and began to read aloud. He read word by word, and when he read Article 20 of the General Program: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Its task is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty," everyone cheered and almost said in unison: "Read it again, read it again! We must especially remember this article, it is prescribed for us."
    Comrade Zhou Qinsheng read on word by word, and everyone listened attentively: some with smiles, some staring ahead, deep in thought. At this time, who could not recall those difficult years of the past? In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the three years of the People's Liberation War, the Chinese people went through all kinds of hardships and overcame numerous difficulties to have what we have today. The draft constitution affirms this extremely precious victory of the people's revolution and points out the path for our country to move towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. How can I not be excited and jubilant! I read the draft constitution repeatedly and couldn't help but recall those martyrs. I am a naval soldier, and I will study harder to defend the motherland.

    保卫祖国的海岸是我们的任务
    人民海军战士　宋嗣徽
    六月十五日，听说要公布宪法草案。这天，在我们办公室里，只要听到门响一下，大家都不约而同地回过头去看看：是不是报纸送来了。上午十点钟，门哗啦一响，送报的同志满面喜气地走进来，大家就跳起来围住他争着看报。周芹生同志首先接过报纸，他把两手一摊说：“同志们，静一静！”他搬过一只椅子坐在我们当中，高声朗读起来。他一个字一个字地念着，当他念到总纲第二十条：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整。”时，大家都欢呼起来，几乎齐声说：“再念一遍，再念一遍！特别要记住这一条，这是给我们规定的。”
    周芹生同志逐字逐句往下念，大家聚精会神地听着：有的含着微笑，有的凝视前方，若有所思。这时候，谁能不回忆起过去那些艰难的岁月呢？在八年的抗日战争和三年的人民解放战争里，中国人民历尽千辛万苦，克服了重重困难，才有了今天。宪法草案肯定了这一极其珍贵的人民革命的胜利成果，指出了我国走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的道路，我怎能不激动、欢欣鼓舞呢！我反复地读了宪法草案，不由自主地回忆起那些先烈们。我是一个海军战士，我将更好地学习，保卫祖国。
