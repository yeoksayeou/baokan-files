    Hunan Province Completes Mid-Season Rice Transplanting
    The mid-season rice transplanting work in Hunan Province has basically concluded. All one hundred and fourteen state-owned farms in the province have completed transplanting, generally several days earlier than the farmers. Currently, the seedlings are growing well in various locations. Farmers and farm workers are now generally shifting to tasks such as weeding, applying fertilizer, and irrigation.
    This year, various regions have paid attention to studying and improving transplanting techniques, universally implementing uniform and dense planting. Various farms have also adopted methods such as holding symposiums and organizing visits to teach dense planting techniques to farmers. The area of paddy fields with promoted dense planting throughout the province will reach 30% of the total area, with each mu generally planting one to two thousand more seedlings than in the past. The province has also expanded the double-cropping rice area by 600,000 mu and promoted improved varieties on 2 million mu. These measures have created conditions for increased grain production this year.

    湖南省完成中稻插秧
    湖南省中稻插秧工作已基本结束。全省一百一十四个国营农场已全部完成插秧工作，一般比农民都要早几天。目前各地秧苗生长情况良好，农民和农场职工正普遍转入耘田、追肥和排灌等工作。
    今年各地都注意研究和改进了插秧技术，普遍实行了均匀密植，各农场还采用召开座谈会和组织参观等方式，向农民传授密植技术，全省推广密植的水田将达总面积的百分之三十，每亩田一般比过去要多插一千余蔸到两千蔸。全省还扩大了双季稻面积六十万亩，推广良种二百万亩。这些都为今年粮食增产创造了条件。
