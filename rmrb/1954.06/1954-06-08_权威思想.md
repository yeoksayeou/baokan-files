    "Authoritative Thinking"
  　 Xiaoyuan
    Around 11:00 AM on May 7th, a jeep drove along the highway. Sun Yanxiang, a vehicle inspector at the Liuting Highway Management Station, waved a red flag to stop the car and went forward to inspect it.
      "Why doesn't this vehicle have a road maintenance fee certificate or a free pass?" Sun Yanxiang asked politely.
      "Let me tell you," a passenger wearing yellow-rimmed glasses replied impatiently, "This car was requisitioned from the Qingdao Transportation Company. Do I have to pay road maintenance fees for a trip from Yantai to Qingdao?"
    At this point, Sun Yanxiang patiently explained the regulations that "temporary free passes are available for single trips, and annual free passes are available for long-term use." He then proceeded to inquire why the driver didn't have a license.
    "I'm not talking to you, I'm going to find the station chief." The passenger began to lose his temper.
    He instructed the driver, "Don't bother with him." Then he ordered Sun Yanxiang, "You're not allowed to inspect this car! Go find the station chief."
    The inspector was puzzled and asked, "Why?" The passenger scolded, "I am Zhou Yunxiang, the director of the Highway Bureau. You are not allowed to inspect this car, so you don't need to inspect it."
    According to the implementation details of the interim measures for motor vehicle management, a driver not carrying a driver's license is a major violation, and at the very least, it must be registered for processing. Just as the driver walked into the management station to complete the registration procedures, a loud shout was heard: "You're deliberately making trouble!" Director Zhou stormed in after the shout. "I don't need you to inspect the car today, inspect your own authoritative thinking!" He took off his hat and threw it more than two meters away, demonstrating how much he hated these subordinates with "authoritative thinking."
    The station chief returned, and as soon as Director Zhou saw him, he angrily questioned, "What's going on? We can't leave!"
    The station chief was confused. Comrade Xing, who was in the car with the director, explained the situation to him. However, the director began to sternly rebuke: "Who told you to inspect the car? Humph! Who told you to inspect the car?" He then "instructed" that the management station should no longer inspect vehicles from the transportation company in the future, and that they should all be the responsibility of the Vehicle Supervision Office.
    The superiors' "instructions" must be obeyed. However, what about the violation that had already been registered at the management station according to previous regulations? Should it be transferred to the Qingdao Vehicle Supervision Office for processing? This question once again offended Director Zhou, who was still in a rage. He immediately erupted in anger: "How much power does the Vehicle Supervision Office have? The Supervision Office can't handle it."
    All the cadres at the management station were intimidated by the director's authority, and no one dared to speak.
    Finally, Director Zhou said in a relatively softer tone: "In my opinion, it's better not to inspect the transportation company's vehicles." Shortly after, he left this group of cadres, whom he had scolded for having "authoritative thinking," and the management station, which he had turned upside down, with lingering anger, and got into the jeep to go to Qingdao. Seeing Director Zhou off were the discussions of nearby people who had witnessed the dispute: "That kind of director is really powerful." "Does it mean that traffic rules only apply to others and not to himself?"

    “权威思想”
  　 晓园
    五月七日上午十一时左右，一辆小吉普沿着公路驶来。流亭公路管理站检车员孙延祥红旗一挥，让车停下来，就上前去检查。
      “为什么车上没有养路费证。也没有免费证？”孙延祥谦和地问。
      “我告诉你，”车上一位戴着黄腿眼镜的乘客不耐烦地回答：“这车是我向青岛运输公司调来的，从烟台到青岛去一趟，还得交养路费吗？”
    这时，孙延祥还是耐心地说明“出车一次有临时免费证，长期的有年度免费证”的规定。并继续检查驾驶员又为什么没有执照。
    “不跟你说，找站长去。”这位乘客不禁发起脾气来了。
    他一面吩咐驾驶员：“不用和他叨咕。”接着就对孙延祥下起命令来了：“不准你检查！找站长去。”
    检车员感到奇怪，问了一句“为什么”。这位乘客训斥道：“我是公路局局长周云祥。这车不准你检查，你就不用检查。”
    按照汽车管理暂行办法实施细则的规定，驾驶员不带驾驶执照是重要违章，至少也得登记一下，以便处理。当着驾驶员走进管理站正要办理登记手续时，忽听得一声大喝：“你们存心找麻烦！”周局长随着喝声进门来了。“我今天不用你们检查车啦，检查检查你们的权威思想吧！”他摘下自己的帽子，一下摔出两公尺多远，显示了他对这些有着“权威思想”的下级是感到如何的痛恨。
    站长回来了，周局长一见站长，劈头就气呼呼地责问：“怎么办？走不了啦！”
    站长弄得摸不着头脑，一位和局长同车的邢同志向他说明了情况，局长却在一旁厉声训斥开了：“谁叫你们检查车？哼！谁叫你们检查车？”接着又“指示”说，今后运输公司的车管理站再也不准检查，一律由车辆监理所负责。
    上级的“指示”不能不服从，但是，根据以往的规定已经在管理站登记了的违章事件怎么办呢？是否移交到青岛车辆监理所去处理？这一问，又触犯了怒气未息的周局长。他马上大发雷霆：“车辆监理所有多大的权力？监理所管不了。”
    全管理站的干部都被局长的声威所震慑了，谁也不敢再讲话。
    最后，周局长总算用比较缓和的口气说了一句：“我的意见，运输公司的车还是不检查好。”不一会，就带着余怒离开了这批被他训斥为有
  “权威思想”的干部和被他闹得天翻地覆的管理站，乘上小吉普上青岛去了。给周局长送行的，是亲眼看到这场纠纷的附近群众的议论声：“这样的局长真厉害。”“难道交通规则光管别人，不管自己吗？”
