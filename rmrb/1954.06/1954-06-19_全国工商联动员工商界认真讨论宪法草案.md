    National Federation of Industry and Commerce Mobilizes Workers and Business Community to Seriously Discuss Draft Constitution. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a notice regarding the widespread organization of the industrial and commercial sectors to discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The notice requires local federations of industry and commerce, under the unified arrangement and leadership of governments at all levels, to vigorously organize and promote private industrialists and merchants to participate in the discussion of this constitutional draft, striving for widespread and in-depth participation, ensuring everyone takes part and discusses it seriously. After explaining the great political significance of our country's formulation of a constitution and the promulgation of the draft constitution, the notice pointed out that private industrialists and merchants should be as concerned about this major event as the people of the whole country. Everyone must adopt a serious and responsible attitude and put forward their own opinions on the draft constitution. Through various reports, discussions, and reading documents, they should gain a deep understanding of the basic content of the draft constitution. In particular, they should appreciate that our people's constitution is a truly democratic constitution of the socialist type, which, on the one hand, protects the various forms of ownership existing in our country according to the actual situation during our transition period; on the other hand, it clearly stipulates that our entire national economy is developing under the leadership of the socialist economy, moving forward towards the goal of building a socialist society. The notice also requires private industrialists and merchants, through the discussion of this draft constitution, to more clearly understand their status, future, and direction of efforts during the country's transition period, enhance their sense of patriotism and law-abidingness, and their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation, actively operate their businesses, create conditions, strive to gradually transform into various forms of state capitalism economy, and work hard to realize our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.
