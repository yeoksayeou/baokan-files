    To welcome the peak season of the wheat harvest and strengthen the material resources of state-owned grassroots stores, the Commercial Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee held an internal materials exchange meeting of the North China Department Store System in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, from May 9th to 18th. The total value of commodities traded at the meeting reached over 157.7 billion yuan, of which small commodities accounted for 79 percent of the total turnover.

    Through the materials exchange meeting, various regions replenished supplies for the peak wheat harvest season. The Hebei Provincial State-Owned Department Store System purchased goods worth over 128 billion yuan at the meeting, and the Shanxi Provincial Company of the China Department Store Company purchased over 18.7 billion yuan worth of commodities. Many state-owned stores in Hebei Province purchased goods worth 7 to 8 billion yuan, increasing the variety of goods by more than 200 types, preparing supplies for the second and third quarters, and arranging part of the supply for the fourth quarter.

    Through the materials exchange meeting, the quantity of industrial products sent to the countryside was expanded. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company alone released commodities worth 101.7 billion yuan at the meeting. At the same time, because representatives of grassroots state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hebei Province also participated in the materials exchange meeting and met with representatives of the purchasing and supply stations, they introduced production and sales situations to each other through seminars, sample exhibitions, and individual visits. This will play a significant role in organizing commodity exchanges in a planned manner and promoting the improvement of products by production departments. (Liu Zhiqing, Zhou Tongxi)

    迎接麦收旺季，充实基层商店物资力量
    华北区百货系统举行内部物资交流会
    为了迎接麦收旺季，充实国营基层商店的物资力量，华北行政委员会商业局等于五月九日到十八日在河北省石家庄市召开了华北区百货系统内部物资交流会。会上成交商品的总值达一千五百七十七亿余元，其中小百货占总成交额的百分之七十九。
    通过物资交流会，各地充实了麦收旺季供应的物资。河北省国营百货系统在会上购进了价值一千二百八十余亿元的货物，中国百货公司山西省公司购买了一百八十七亿余元的商品。河北省许多国营商店都进货价值达七、八十亿元，商品品种增加二百多种，准备了第二、第三两季度的供应物资，并安排了第四季度的一部分货源。
    通过物资交流会，扩大了工业品下乡的数量。仅中国百货公司天津市采购供应站，即在会上下放了一千零一十七亿元的商品。同时，由于河北省基层国营商店和供销合作社的代表也参加了物资交流会，和采购供应站的代表见了面，通过座谈、样品展览和个别访问等方式，彼此介绍了产销情况，这对有计划地组织商品交流和推动生产部门改进产品将起不小作用。　（刘志庆　周同熙）
