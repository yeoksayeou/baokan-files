    Workers' Heartfelt Words
    ——A Record of the Constitution Draft Discussion at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    By Our Correspondents Pei Lan and Dian Yi

    On the afternoon of the 15th, the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a forum on the draft constitution. Twelve people participated, including model workers, advanced producers, engineers, technicians, and staff. At the meeting, everyone expressed their opinions on the promulgation of the draft constitution.

    Liu Zhenwu, an engineer from the Iron Smelting Department, said: The formulation of the draft constitution shows the further development of our country. It fully conforms to the demands and wishes of the people, and it reflects the fundamental requirements of the country's transition period. After the draft constitution is discussed and adopted by the National People's Congress, it will continue to consolidate our revolutionary achievements and ensure the early arrival of a socialist society. As an engineer, I welcome it with joy, and I will welcome it with practical actions. I will learn more from the Soviet Union, earnestly implement the advanced Soviet experience, humbly learn from the workers, further develop the technical innovation movement, and strive to increase the production of pig iron by 10,000 tons in 1954.

    Hou Decheng, the blast furnace foreman of the Iron Smelting Department and a Beijing model worker, continued: The promulgation of the draft constitution makes me feel indescribably happy. The draft constitution proposes the gradual elimination of exploitation and poverty and the establishment of a socialist society, which fundamentally reflects our wishes. In the future, our entire group will help each other, improve the equipment of the blast furnace, and improve product quality so that our wishes can be realized as soon as possible. In the old society, we were oppressed and exploited and had no right to manage national affairs. Today is different. I was elected as a district people's representative, and I must serve the people and promptly reflect the people's opinions and demands to the state organs.

    Chen Hongzhi, a female worker and advanced producer from the General Machinery Room, said: After seeing the draft constitution, I was really extremely happy. The article in the draft constitution stipulating that women enjoy equal citizenship rights as men particularly caught my attention. When I was a child, I asked my mother to let me go to school. My mother replied: A girl should stay at home and not step out of the gate. When she grows up, she should find a husband's family where she has food and drink. Why go to school? At that time, I was very unconvinced. Why can't girls study and work like boys? Today, I understand that in the old society, women suffered more oppression than men. Only in the new society can women enjoy equal rights as men. Now, I am only a teenager, but I can operate automated machines and have been awarded the glorious title of advanced producer. What an extraordinary thing this is! I will definitely work hard, learn my skills, and build my motherland.

    Cao Xiuren, a technician from the Coking Workshop, said: The General Program of the draft constitution stipulates that labor is an honorable thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work. The state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor. I have the deepest understanding of this. In the past, I suffered deeply from the pain of being out of school and unemployed. After graduating from high school in 1938, I dropped out of school because my family couldn't afford to support me. At that time, I was only eighteen years old and wandered everywhere. Today I teach at this school, and tomorrow I may be forced to get out. In the old society, how could a person like me find a fixed occupation! In 1950, I joined the work at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. At the end of last year, I was transferred here. The leadership attaches great importance to me. In the past, an engineer could not do the coke oven work even after working for seven or eight years, but I was allowed to take charge of the coke oven work after working for less than two years. This shows that only in a country led by the Communist Party and the working class can people give full play to their wisdom and talents.

    An Kun, a worker in the Transportation Department and a Beijing model worker, said: After listening to people read the draft constitution, I have many thoughts in my heart. Before liberation, our workers had no status, were exploited and oppressed. Today, the General Program of the draft constitution stipulates that the working class is the leading class of the country, and the lives of workers are guaranteed by law. Take me as an example, I am just an ordinary worker and was also elected as a people's representative in the district. I have already attended the factory's night school, and soon I will be able to read newspapers. Today, our group has calculated that we will continue to promote the advanced experience of Bai Xiaosheng's freight car repair method and strive to complete this year's production tasks ahead of schedule at the end of October. This is what our workers must do when they say it.

    Doctor Qiu Lianyin said: I am a medical worker. In the old society, I also wanted to do something for the working people, but I didn't have the conditions and couldn't fulfill my wish. After liberation, I joined the medical work and felt very honored to be able to do my part for the health of the broad masses of workers. In the past few years, our factory has achieved a lot in medical and health work. Protecting the health of workers so that they can contribute more to the national construction is the greatest glory of our medical staff and our sacred duty. Today, the state has promulgated the draft constitution, which on the one hand guarantees the work of every medical worker, and on the other hand, enables workers to fully enjoy their due rights in terms of social insurance and social relief.

    Gao Jun, an old worker with thirty years of service and a Beijing model worker, said: Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I often thought: When I get old, I might be fired at any time. It's really living one day at a time with no tomorrow. After liberation, I don't think about these things at all, because the state has promulgated labor protection regulations, which have improved the lives of workers day by day, and I no longer have to worry about unemployment or not being able to retire. Now, the draft constitution clearly stipulates that workers have the right to receive material assistance in their old age. Today, the only thing I think about is how to use my labor to fulfill my due obligations.

    Li Congzhi, a worker in the Power Department and a Beijing model worker, said: When I was a child, I heard my father say that in feudal society, only the emperor had the final say, and his words were the golden rule. I have also heard that the Kuomintang reactionaries engaged in some kind of "constitution," but they did not let us workers know. Today, the draft constitution stipulates that the people are the masters of their own affairs. This is a world of difference. Since we are the masters of the People's Republic of China, we should do our best to increase production, realize national industrialization, and make a socialist society come as soon as possible, and do everything possible to fulfill the sacred duty of defending the motherland.

    Wu Chunze, a staff member of the Technical Education Section, said: The promulgation of the draft constitution is a great happy event for our country. It stipulates that the people have the power to manage the country. This is fundamentally different from the so-called "constitution" of capitalist countries. The wording of the draft constitution is simple and easy to understand, and even a person with a not very high level of education can understand it. I think this is also a characteristic of the people's constitution. The draft constitution also clearly stipulates that citizens have the right to education, and the state establishes and gradually expands various schools and other cultural and educational institutions to ensure that citizens enjoy this right. Take our factory as an example, in the past few years, the factory has established many night schools, and this year it will gradually increase the number of cultural classes and technical classes and other spare-time learning organizations. I am a technical education cadre of the factory, and I will definitely be loyal to my duties and improve these organizations in order to improve the political, cultural, scientific and technological level of the workers.

    Wen Yingqi, a staff member of the Staff Welfare Section and a Hui nationality person, said: After seeing the draft constitution, what moved me the most was that the draft constitution clearly stipulates that people of all ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights in all aspects. All ethnic groups have the freedom to develop their own languages and writing, and to maintain or reform their own customs and religious beliefs. In the old society, our ethnic minorities did not even have the right to live, let alone any freedom. I support the draft constitution with great enthusiasm. In the future, I will do my job well with the attitude of being the master of my own affairs to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Wang Zhiguo, an old worker in the Foundry Department and a Beijing model worker, said: After seeing the draft constitution, I feel unspeakable excitement and joy in my heart. In the old society, we worked from morning to night every day, and the money we earned could not even buy two catties of cornmeal. We often didn't have enough to eat or wear, and we often worked while sick. Old Liu, who used to work with me, was frozen and starved to death. Now, we are the masters of the country. In the past, labor was considered lowly, but now labor is an honorable thing. In the past, the working people had no rights, but now the working people can enjoy the right to rest and the right to education. Our factory now has night sanatoriums, sanatoriums, hospitals, as well as spare-time schools and technical schools, etc., where employees can go to recuperate and study. We must continue to work hard to create a happier life.

    The last to express his opinion at the meeting was Yang Kui, a worker in the Electrical Repair Shop of the Power Department and a Beijing model worker. He said: I was really happy when I saw the full text of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China published in the newspaper. As a member of the working class, I must support the draft constitution with practical actions. We have established a technical innovation group, and now everyone is studying several rationalization proposals for improving equipment. After these proposals are implemented, they will greatly improve product quality and improve work efficiency. But we are not satisfied with this achievement, and we must rely more on the Party, unite the masses, and further deepen the technical innovation movement.

    工人们的心里话
    ——记石景山钢铁厂的宪法草案座谈会
    本报记者　培兰　甸义
    十五日下午，北京石景山钢铁厂召开了一个关于宪法草案的座谈会，参加座谈的有劳动模范、先进生产者、工程师、技术人员、职员等十二人。会上，每一个人都对宪法草案的公布发表了自己的意见。
    炼铁部工程师刘振武说：宪法草案的制订，表明了我们国家的进一步发展。它完全符合人民的要求、人民的愿望，它反映了国家过渡时期的根本要求。这个宪法草案经过全国人民代表大会讨论通过以后，将继续巩固我们的革命成果，保证社会主义社会的早日到来。我是一个工程师，我以欢欣的心情来迎接它，并且要以实际行动来迎接它。我要更好地向苏联学习，认真贯彻苏联先进经验，虚心向工人学习，进一步开展技术革新运动，为一九五四年增产一万吨生铁而奋斗。
    炼铁部高炉值班工长、北京市劳动模范侯德成接着说：宪法草案的公布，使我心里感到说不出的高兴。宪法草案提出逐步消灭剥削、消灭贫困，建立社会主义社会，这根本反映了我们的愿望。今后，我们全小组要互相帮助，改善高炉的设备，提高产品质量，使我们的愿望早日实现。在旧社会里我们是受压迫、受剥削的，没有权去管什么国家大事，今天可不同了，我被选为区人民代表，我一定要为人民办事，及时地向国家机关反映人民的意见和要求。
    总机械室女工、先进生产者陈鸿芝说：看到宪法草案以后，我真高兴极啦。宪法草案中规定妇女享有同男子平等的公民权利这一条，特别引起我的注意。小时候我要求母亲让我去上学，母亲回答我说：做闺女的就应该大门不出、二门不迈才对，大了找个婆家有吃有喝，上学干吗？当时我听了很不服气，为什么女孩子就不能和男孩子一样念书和做事呢？今天我懂得了在旧社会妇女比男子多受一重压迫，只有在新社会妇女才可能享受同男子平等的权利。现在，我只不过十几岁，已能操纵自动化机器，并且得到先进生产者的光荣称号，这该是多么不平凡的事呀。我一定努力工作，学好本领，建设自己的祖国。
    炼焦车间技术员曹修仁说：宪法草案总纲规定劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情。国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性。我对这一条体会最深。过去我深受失学失业的痛苦。一九三八年高中毕业后，因为家里没有钱供给我念书，我就失学了。当时我才十八岁，到处流浪，今天在这个学校教书，明天说不定就得被迫滚蛋。在旧社会里像我这样的人，那里能找到个固定的职业呢！一九五○年我参加了太原钢铁厂的工作，去年年底被调到这里来。领导方面很重视我。过去，一个工程师做了七、八年工作，还不能做烤炉工作，而我参加工作不到两年，就让我担任烤炉工作。这说明只有在共产党、工人阶级领导的国家中，人们才能够发挥自己的智慧和才能。
    运输部工人、北京市劳动模范安崑说：我听人读了宪法草案，心里有很多感想。解放以前，咱们工人是没有地位的，受剥削、被压迫；今天宪法草案总纲规定工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，工人的生活从法律上得到了保障。就拿我来说吧，我只是一个普通的工人，也当选了区里的人民代表。我已经上了工厂的夜校，不久以后我也可以看报了。今天，咱们小组核计了一下，要继续推广白晓生货车检修法的先进经验，争取在十月底提前完成今年的生产任务，这是我们工人说到了就一定要做到的。
    医生邱连荫说：我是一个医务工作者。在旧社会里，我也想为劳动人民做点事情，但是没有条件，不能如愿。解放后，我参加了医疗工作，能为广大职工的卫生事业尽一点力，感到很光荣。几年来我们工厂在医疗卫生工作方面收到了不少成绩。保护劳动者的身体健康，使他们能够为国家建设事业多出一把力，就是我们医务工作人员的最大光荣，也是我们的神圣义务。今天，国家公布了宪法草案，它一方面保障了每一个医务工作者的工作，另一方面又使工人在社会保险、社会救济等方面充分享受到了自己应享的权利。
    有三十年工龄的老工人、北京市劳动模范高俊说：在国民党反动派统治下，我常常想：年纪老了，说不定什么时候就会被辞退。真是过了今天没了明天。解放以后，我根本就不想这些事了，因为国家公布了劳动保护条例，使工人的生活一天天提高，我再也不用担心失业或者没法养老的问题。现在，宪法草案中更明文规定劳动者在年老的时候，有获得物质帮助的权利。今天，我唯一想到的就是怎样用自己的劳动，完成自己应尽的义务。
    动力部工人、北京市劳动模范李聪智说：小时候我曾经听父亲说过，在封建社会里只有皇帝说了算，他的话就是金科玉律。我也曾听说国民党反动派搞过什么“宪法”，但不让我们工人知道。今天宪法草案规定人民当家做主。这真有天上地下的差别。我们既然是中华人民共和国的主人，就应该尽自己最大的力量，提高生产，实现国家工业化，使社会主义社会早日到来，并且尽一切力量完成保卫祖国的神圣职责。
    技术教育科职员吴春泽说：宪法草案的公布，是我们国家的一件大喜事。它规定人民有管理国家的大权。这是和资本主义国家的所谓“宪法”根本不同的。宪法草案的文字，通俗易懂，一个文化水平不很高的人都可以看得懂。我认为这也是人民宪法的特点。宪法草案还明白规定公民享有受教育的权利，国家设立并且逐步扩大各种学校和其他文化教育机关，以保证公民享受这种权利。就拿我们的工厂来说，过去几年工厂办了很多夜校，今年还要逐步增办文化班和技术班等业余学习组织。我是工厂的技术教育干部，我一定忠于自己的职守，把这些组织健全起来，为提高工人的政治、文化和科学技术水平而努力。
    职工福利科的一个职员、回族人文颖琦说：我看到宪法草案后，使我感动最深的，是宪法草案中明确规定了各少数民族人民在各方面享有平等权利。各民族都有发展自己的语言、文字，保持或改革自己的风俗习惯和宗教信仰的自由。在旧社会，我们少数民族人民连生活的权利都没有，那里还有什么自由。我以万分热烈的心情拥护宪法草案。今后我要以主人翁的态度，把工作做好，来感谢共产党和毛主席。
    铸造部老工人、北京市劳动模范王治国说：看到宪法草案后，心里有说不出的兴奋和喜悦。在旧社会里，我们每天从早到晚工作，赚来的钱还买不到二斤玉米面，经常吃不饱、穿不暖，还常常带病工作。曾经和我在一起工作的老刘，就是这样冻饿死的。现在，我们是国家的主人了。过去，劳动被认为是卑贱的，现在劳动是一件光荣事情。过去，劳动人民没有任何权利，现在劳动人民可以享受休息权利、受教育的权利。我们厂里现在有夜间休养所、疗养院、医院，还有业余学校、技术学校等，职工们可以到那里去休养、学习。我们必须继续努力，创造更幸福的生活。
    在会上最后发表意见的是动力部电气修理场工人、北京市劳动模范杨奎。他说：我看到报纸上公布了中华人民共和国宪法草案全文以后，心里真高兴。我是工人阶级的一分子，一定要以实际行动来拥护宪法草案。我们已成立了一个技术革新小组，现在大伙正在研究几个改进设备的合理化建议，这些建议实现后，将大大提高产品质量，提高工作效率。但我们并不满足这点成绩，要更好地依靠党，团结群众，进一步深入地开展技术革新运动。
