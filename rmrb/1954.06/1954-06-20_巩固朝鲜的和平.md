Consolidating Peace in Korea

The Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question was forced to end without any agreement due to the United States' unreasonable refusal of all peaceful efforts made by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union. However, the proposals put forward by Korea, China, and the Soviet Union for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question cannot be obliterated. Today, after the negotiations on the Korean question have been sabotaged by the United States, guaranteeing and striving to consolidate peace in Korea has become an urgent task.

The six suggestions for guaranteeing peace proposed by Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Nam Il at the last meeting discussing the Korean question, and fully supported by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov, provide a clear direction for the future struggle to consolidate peace in Korea. Foreign Minister Nam Il pointed out in his speech that maintaining and consolidating peace in Korea would help realize the task of unifying Korea in the future and would help ease tensions in international relations. The speeches of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Molotov also believed that consolidating peace in Korea is very important for the interests of the Korean people and the interests of peace in the Far East and the world.

As everyone knows, the U.S. delegation rejected Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion and refused to undertake the obligation to jointly maintain peace in Korea. This more clearly exposes the conspiratorial goals of the U.S. ruling clique and shows how guaranteeing and consolidating peace in Korea is a practical requirement and how important it is for peace-loving people and countries around the world to take on this responsibility.

The armistice state in Korea is not yet a consolidated peace; the primary condition for promoting the transition from the armistice state to a state of peace is the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. Article 60 of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that this issue must be resolved after the armistice, and the countries concerned have the task of implementing this provision. This is completely reasonable. Since there is an armistice, there is no need for foreign troops to remain in Korea. The people of all countries who have children stationed in Korea all demand that their children return home to live peacefully as soon as possible; the Korean people also hope to live freely without foreign interference. The withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea will undoubtedly satisfy the Korean people and the people of the countries concerned. The Chinese People's Volunteers' arrival in Korea is fundamentally different in nature from the American troops; they went there to resist American aggression. Nevertheless, the Chinese people still advocate the simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

The withdrawal of all foreign troops is inseparable from maintaining the Korean armistice and eliminating the threat of war in Korea. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique insist that U.S. troops must remain in Korea and have signed a so-called "Common Defense Treaty," allowing U.S. troops to permanently occupy Korean territory. This clearly not only hinders Korea's independence but also aims to turn South Korea into a springboard for the United States to launch new military adventures in the Far East. The Korean people and peace-loving people of all countries must stop this sinister plan of the U.S.-Rhee clique.

While trying to maintain U.S. military and colonial rule in South Korea, the United States is expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Since the armistice, the South Korean puppet army has increased from sixteen divisions to twenty divisions; and the American Van Fleet is also undertaking a task, which is to build fifteen more infantry divisions and a huge air force for South Korea in the near future. The active expansion of armaments and war preparations by the U.S.-Rhee clique not only threatens the stability of the Korean armistice but also makes the post-war life of the South Korean people even more difficult. According to the revelation of Syngman Rhee's puppet "Prime Minister" Baek Too-chin alone, the taxes borne by the South Korean people for expanding armaments and war preparations account for an average of 48.9 percent of their income. In contrast, the Korean Democratic People's Republic immediately turned to peaceful construction work after the armistice and began implementing a three-year plan to restore and develop the economy this year, and the people's lives have therefore seen initial improvements. The Korean Democratic People's Republic's advocacy of reducing the military strength of North and South Korea is precisely to ensure the conditions for the peaceful development of North and South Korea in the future and to reduce military expenditures so that the lives of the people of both North and South Korea can be improved. This plan vividly embodies the Korean Democratic People's Republic's deep concern for peace and the vital interests of the people. The South Korean people also yearn for reduced armies and reduced burdens after the armistice, and for a lasting peaceful life.

The consolidation of peace in Korea should be jointly promoted and maintained by all the Korean people. Korea is a single nation with a long history; the people of North and South Korea are fully capable of cooperating to promote peace. At the same time, the existence of the military demarcation line should never cause the economic and cultural ties between the people of North and South Korea, which have existed since ancient times, to be cut off for a long time. Therefore, the joint efforts of the people of North and South Korea to eliminate the state of war and promote the restoration of economic and cultural ties will undoubtedly normalize the situation in Korea and create favorable conditions for the restoration of the peaceful unification of Korea. Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion to organize an all-Korea committee to establish and develop economic and cultural relations between North and South Korea has clearly expressed the Korean people's strong desire for peaceful cooperation and mutual rapprochement, which cannot be ignored.

Peace in Korea is related to peace in Asia and the world, and countries related to the Korean question should assume the obligation to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union have repeatedly expressed their willingness to assume this obligation together with other countries. The U.S. ruling clique refuses to assume this obligation; it not only does not want peace in Korea to be guaranteed but, on the contrary, is trying to expand the military obligations borne by South Korea to the United States. Van Fleet's travels between South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan are to expand the U.S.-Rhee "Common Defense Treaty" into a so-called "North Pacific Alliance" including the Syngman Rhee clique, the Yoshida government, and the Kuomintang remnants, and to use this "alliance" as the "foundation" of a Southeast Asian aggression group. From this, it is of course not difficult for people to see what sinister deeds the U.S.-Rhee clique is preparing to do.

The day after the United States sabotaged the meeting on the Korean question, South Korea's Pyun Yung-tai publicly declared at a press conference that South Korea "no longer considers itself obligated to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement." Pyun Yung-tai's clamor quickly and thoroughly revealed the ulterior motives of the United States in sabotaging the Korean question negotiations.

It can be seen from this that although Foreign Minister Nam Il's suggestion on consolidating peace in Korea failed to reach an agreement at the Geneva Conference, the various tasks proposed by this suggestion should still become the common goals of the Korean people and all those who support a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

Peace in Korea is not only directly related to the interests of the Korean people but is also inseparable from the interests of peace and security in all countries, especially those in the Far East. The Korean people who have awakened and stood up, the peace-loving people and countries of all countries, must not allow the United States to undermine peace in Korea, and they have the power to maintain peace in Korea.

    巩固朝鲜的和平
    高集
    日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的会议，由于美国横蛮无理地拒绝朝、中、苏三国所作的一切和平努力，而被迫结束，没有获得任何协议。但是，朝、中、苏三国为和平解决朝鲜问题所提出的建议，不可能被抹煞掉。今天，在朝鲜问题的谈判被美国一手破坏之后，保证和争取巩固朝鲜的和平，成了迫切的任务。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在讨论朝鲜问题的最后一次会议上提出的、并为周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长全力支持的关于保证和平的六项建议，为今后巩固朝鲜和平的斗争提供了明确的方针。南日外务相在发言中指出，维护和巩固朝鲜的和平将有助于实现将来统一朝鲜的任务，并将有助于国际关系中紧张局势的缓和。周恩来外长和莫洛托夫外长的发言，也都认为巩固朝鲜的和平对于朝鲜人民的利益和远东与世界和平的利益是非常重要的。
    大家知道，美国代表团拒绝了南日外务相的这个建议，拒绝承担共同维持朝鲜和平的义务。这就更加清楚地暴露了美国统治集团的阴谋目的，并显示出保证和巩固朝鲜的和平是如何切合实际的要求，全世界爱好和平的人民和国家把这个责任担负起来又是如何的重要。
    朝鲜的停战状态还不是巩固的和平；促使停战状态转入和平状态的首要条件是从朝鲜撤退一切外国武装力量。朝鲜停战协定第六十款中曾明文规定在停战后必须解决这一问题，有关各国负有执行这一规定的任务。这是完全合理的。因为既然停战了，外国军队就没有留在朝鲜的必要。有子弟驻在朝鲜的各国人民无不要求他们的子弟早日回家过和平生活；朝鲜人民也都希望过自由生活而不受外国干涉。外国军队从朝鲜的撤退，无疑将使朝鲜人民和有关各国人民感到满意。中国人民志愿军到朝鲜与美国军队在性质上根本不同，他们是为了反抗美国的侵略而去的。虽然如此，中国人民仍然主张一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜。
    撤退一切外国军队，对维护朝鲜的停战，消除在朝鲜的战争威胁，是不能分开的。美国和李承晚集团坚持美国军队必须留在朝鲜，并签订了所谓
  “共同防御条约”，使美国军队得以永久占领朝鲜领土，这显然不但妨碍朝鲜的独立，并且是为了要把南朝鲜变成美国在远东发动新的军事冒险的跳板。朝鲜人民和各国爱好和平的人民一定要阻止美李集团的这种罪恶计划。
    和力图保持美国在南朝鲜的军事殖民统治的同时，美国正在扩充李承晚伪军。自停战以来，南朝鲜伪军已从十六个师增加至二十个师；并且美国的范佛里特还负担了一个任务，就是要在不久的将来再为南朝鲜建立十五个步兵师和巨大的空军部队。美李集团积极扩军备战的措施，不但威胁着朝鲜停战状态的稳定，而且使南朝鲜人民战后的生活陷于更加困苦的境地。仅据李承晚的伪“国务总理”白斗镇的透露，南朝鲜人民为扩军备战而负担的税金，平均已占他们收入的百分之四十八点九。与此相反，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在停战后，立即转入和平建设的工作，并已于今年开始执行恢复和发展经济的三年计划，人民生活因而已有了初步的改善。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国主张缩减南北朝鲜的军队力量，正是为了要使南北朝鲜今后和平发展的条件得到保证，并减轻军费负担，以使南北朝鲜人民的生活都能有所改善。这个计划，生动地体现了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国对于和平与人民切身利益的深切关怀。南朝鲜人民也渴望停战后缩减军队，减轻负担，过持久的和平生活。
    朝鲜和平的巩固要由全体朝鲜人民共同来促进和维护。朝鲜是一个历史悠久的单一民族；南北朝鲜人民完全能够为促进和平而协同合作的。同时，军事分界线的存在，也绝不应该使南北朝鲜人民自古以来的经济和文化的联系长期遭受切断。因此，由南北朝鲜人民共同努力，来消除战争状态，促进经济和文化联系的恢复，无疑将会促使朝鲜的局势正常化，并为恢复朝鲜的和平统一创立下有利的条件。南日外务相关于组织全朝鲜委员会以建立和发展南北朝鲜之间的经济和文化关系的建议，已清楚地表达了朝鲜人民的要求和平合作和相互接近的强烈愿望，这种愿望是不能够被漠视的。
    朝鲜的和平关涉到亚洲及全世界的和平，与朝鲜问题有关的国家应当承担保证朝鲜和平发展的义务。中华人民共和国和苏联已经一再表示愿意与其他国家一道来承担这种义务。美国统治集团拒绝承担这个义务，它不但不愿意朝鲜的和平得到保证，并且相反的正在企图扩大南朝鲜对美国所负担的军事义务。范佛里特在南朝鲜、日本和台湾之间的奔走，就是为了要将美李“共同防御条约”扩大成为一个包括李承晚集团、吉田政府和国民党残匪的所谓“北太平洋联盟”，并要把这个“联盟”作为东南亚侵略集团的“基础”。人们由此当然不难看出，美李集团是要准备干什么罪恶的勾当了。
    就在美国破坏了关于朝鲜问题的会议的第二天，南朝鲜的卞荣泰就公开在记者招待会上宣称南朝鲜“不再认为有义务遵守朝鲜停战协定”了。卞荣泰的叫嚣把美国破坏朝鲜问题谈判的不可告人的目的，迅速而彻底地揭开了。
    由此可见，南日外务相关于巩固朝鲜和平的建议，虽未能在日内瓦会议上达成协议，但这个建议所提出的各个任务，仍然应该成为朝鲜人民和一切支持和平解决朝鲜问题的人们共同奋斗的目标。
    朝鲜的和平，不仅直接有关朝鲜人民的利益，而且同各国特别是远东各国的和平和安全的利益不可分割。已经觉醒和站起来了的朝鲜人民，各国爱好和平的人民和国家，都一定不能容许美国破坏朝鲜的和平，他们是有力量来维护朝鲜的和平的。
