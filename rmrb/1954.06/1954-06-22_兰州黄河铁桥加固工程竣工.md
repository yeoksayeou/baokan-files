    Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge Reinforcement Project Completed

    The Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge reinforcement project was completed on June 12th.

    The Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge was built in 1909 and had long exceeded its warranty period. Following the advice of Soviet experts, comprehensive reinforcement work began on April 1st this year and was successfully completed on June 12th. At 1:00 PM on the same day, vehicles fully loaded with building materials and daily necessities passed through this magnificent iron bridge in a continuous stream.

    In the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge reinforcement project, thanks to the guidance of Soviet experts and the workers' initiative and creativity, this high-altitude operation was completed 18 days ahead of the revised plan. Moreover, no accidents occurred throughout the project, and more than 100 million yuan was saved for the country.

    The reinforcement of this iron bridge received support from Anshan Iron and Steel's steel, Northeast's pine wood, Hankou's cement, and Yumen's asphalt. The quality of the project is very good. Previously, vehicles crossing the bridge could only travel in one direction and at a very slow speed; after the reinforcement of the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge, two lines of vehicles can simultaneously travel in opposite directions, greatly improving transportation efficiency.

    At the completion ceremony on June 12th, the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge Reinforcement Project Committee presented silk banners to nine units, including the Lanzhou Iron Factory, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Gansu Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, and awarded prizes to thirty-four advanced workers.

    兰州黄河铁桥加固工程竣工
    兰州黄河铁桥加固工程已于六月十二日竣工。
    兰州黄河铁桥是一九○九年修起的，早已超过保固年限。经苏联专家建议，从今年四月一日起全面开工加固，到六月十二日胜利竣工。当天下午一时，满载建筑材料和日用品的车辆，源源不绝地通过了这座壮丽的铁桥。
    兰州黄河铁桥加固工程中，得到了苏联专家的指导，工人们发挥了积极性和创造性，所以，这项高空作业工程比修订后的计划提前十八天完工，而且一直没有发生事故，还为国家节约了一亿多元。
    这座铁桥的加固工程，得到了鞍钢的钢材，东北的松木，汉口的水泥、玉门的沥青的支援，工程质量很好。以前过桥的车辆只能单向行车，而且速度很慢；加固后的兰州黄河铁桥，两行车辆可以同时对开，大大发挥了运输效率。
    在六月十二日的竣工典礼大会上，兰州黄河铁桥加固工程委员会，给兰州铁工厂、铁道部第一工程局、甘肃省建筑工程局、兰州通用机器厂等九个单位发了锦旗，并给三十四位先进工作者发了奖品。
