Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 19th: Cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army East China Military Region organs and units warmly welcome the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Yu Genlian, a Red Army veteran and model worker who was wounded seventeen times during the revolutionary war, said excitedly after reading the Draft Constitution: "This is the victorious outcome of the heroic struggle of the Chinese people for more than a century, the blood sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, and also our long-cherished wish." Combat heroes Zhang Ming, Wei Laiguo and others were very happy after reading the Draft Constitution. Zhang Ming said: "When I visited the Soviet Union, I saw the happy life of the Soviet people under the guarantee of the Soviet Constitution. Our Draft Constitution is also of the socialist type, and it will guarantee that our people will live an increasingly happy life." Wei Laiguo said: "The promulgation of the Draft Constitution is another great victory for the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the future, we must resolutely use practical actions to loyally defend the revolutionary achievements of the people of our country and the socialist construction of our motherland."
    When the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution reached an air force airport, pilots and ground crew jumped up with joy. The pilots who had just landed from flying in the sky jumped out of the cockpit to grab and read the Draft Constitution. A certain team that achieved excellent results in flight training used the gap in flight preparation to read the Draft Constitution and held informal discussions. Most of the cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the East China Navy bought newspapers containing the Draft Constitution. Chen Dangdi alone bought three copies of the newspaper, one for himself and two to send to relatives and friends. He said: "This is the people's own Draft Constitution, and it should be conscientiously publicized and discussed."

   【新华社南京十九日电】中国人民解放军华东军区各机关、部队的干部和战士热烈欢迎中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布。曾在革命战争中负伤十七次的红军老战士、模范工作者余根连看了宪法草案后，激动地说：“这是中国人民一百多年来英勇奋斗，无数革命先烈流血牺牲取得的胜利成果，也是我们多年来的愿望。”战斗英雄张明、魏来国等看了宪法草案，都非常高兴。张明说：“我到苏联访问时，看到了苏联人民在苏联宪法保障下的幸福生活。我国的宪法草案也是属于社会主义类型的，它将保障我国人民过着日益幸福的生活。”魏来国说：“宪法草案的公布是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下取得的又一巨大胜利。今后，我们要坚决用实际行动忠诚地保卫祖国人民的革命成果和祖国的社会主义建设。”
    宪法草案公布的消息传到空军某机场，飞行员和地勤人员们都高兴得跳起来。在天空飞行刚刚着陆的飞行员们，从座舱里跳出来就去抢着阅读宪法草案。在飞行训练中获得优良成绩的某队，利用飞行准备的空隙阅读宪法草案，并进行了漫谈。华东海军某部大部分干部、战士买了登载着宪法草案的报纸。陈当弟一人就买了三份报纸，一份自己看，两份寄给亲友。他说：“这是人民自己的宪法草案，应当认真地进行宣传和讨论。”
