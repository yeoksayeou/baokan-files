Since the Central Transportation Department, in the National Highway Transportation Conference in September 1952, targeted the three major shortcomings of high accident rates, high costs, and low efficiency in automobile transportation at the time, it called on automobile transportation enterprises in various regions to launch the "Safety, Four Fixes (implementing fixed quotas for fuel and lubricants, tires, repair mileage, and repair labor and materials), Two Thousand Ton-Kilometers (each ton of transport capacity transports two thousand ton-kilometers per month)" campaign, and vigorously promote advanced driving and advanced repair experiences. The vast number of employees in various regions responded to this call, demonstrated their enthusiasm, and achieved great results. In 1953, the national average accident-free mileage increased by 52% compared to before the campaign, and various quotas have generally approached or exceeded the original targets, with many new records emerging; the average ton-kilometer production per vehicle per month increased by 93% compared to before the campaign, and the national average ton-kilometer production per vehicle per month for both passenger and freight vehicles exceeded 2,000 ton-kilometers in the fourth quarter, an increase of 41% compared to the same period in 1952; costs and freight rates have been significantly reduced in various regions, such as the national average freight rate for gasoline trucks in 1953 being 44% lower than in 1951. With the development of the campaign, some scientific management systems have also been gradually established within enterprises, such as preliminary planning management systems, new dispatching systems, quota management, and three-level maintenance systems, thereby improving the level of enterprise operation and management and accumulating some operation and management experience. In particular, many advanced individuals and advanced experiences have emerged during the campaign. Among the advanced individuals, Zhejiang driver Chen Rongcai has safely driven more than 169,000 kilometers, with an annual ton-kilometer production per vehicle per month of 3,594 ton-kilometers in 1953, fuel consumption lower than the central quota by 7.7% to 24.9%, and engine repair mileage has reached over 120,000 kilometers and is still running, and tire mileage exceeds the central quota by 105%. During the campaign, according to incomplete statistics from 21 enterprises, a total of 2,537 rationalization proposals were put forward, of which 1,272 were related to machine improvements. Due to the implementation of many rationalization proposals, many manual operations have been transformed into machine operations. With the development of the campaign, the material living standards of employees have also improved.
    In order to summarize experience, the Central Transportation Department convened an automobile transportation and technology conference in April and May of this year. Based on the reports of various enterprises and model workers, the conference affirmed the achievements of the campaign, criticized the blindness and conservative thinking in transportation, as well as incorrect business ideas such as neglecting safe transportation, neglecting maintenance and repair, neglecting political and ideological work, and purely pursuing profits. It focused on summarizing advanced experiences in planning management, safe driving, repair and maintenance, fuel conservation, extending tire life, and improving machinery, and formulated new technical standards and operating procedures, and revised various technical and economic quotas. The conference called on automobile transportation enterprises in various regions to continue to improve the level of enterprise operation and management, conscientiously promote planning management, enhance the accuracy of consignment plans, establish and improve operational plans and dispatching work, strengthen technical management, and carry out technical innovation movements to ensure safe transportation, improve transportation quality, continue to reduce costs and freight rates, and complete and overfulfill the transportation tasks for 1954.

    开展“安全、四定、两千吨公里”运动以来
    各地汽车运输工作有显著改进
    一九五二年九月中央交通部在全国公路运输会议上，曾针对当时汽车运输事故多、成本高、效率低等三大缺点，号召各地汽车运输企业开展“安全、四定（贯彻燃润料、轮胎、修理里程、修理工料等四项定额）、两千吨公里（每一吨运力每月运输两千吨公里）”运动，大力推广先进驾驶与先进修理经验。各地广大职工响应了这一号召，发挥了积极性，取得很大成绩。一九五三年全国平均肇事间隔里程比运动前延长百分之五十二，各项定额一般已接近或突破原订指标，出现了许多新纪录；平均车吨月产量比运动前提高百分之九十三，第四季度客货汽车全国平均车吨月产量均超过二千吨公里，比一九五二年同期提高百分之四十一；成本和运价各地均有显著降低，如一九五三年全国平均汽油货车运价较一九五一年降低百分之四十四。随着运动的开展，企业内部也逐步树立了一些科学的管理制度，如初步的计划管理制度，新的调度制度，定额管理及三级保养制度等，从而提高了企业经营管理水平，积累了一些经营管理经验。特别在运动中涌现了许多先进人物与先进经验。先进人物中，如浙江司机陈荣材已安全行驶十六万九千多公里，一九五三年全年车吨月产三千五百九十四吨公里，燃料消耗低于中央定额百分之七点七到百分之二十四点九，引擎修理里程已达十二万公里以上尚在行驶，轮胎里程超过中央定额百分之一百零五。在运动期间，据二十一个企业的不完全统计，共提出合理化建议二千五百三十七件，其中有一千二百七十二件属于机具改进方面的，由于许多合理化建议的实现，把许多手工作业变为机具作业。随着运动的开展，职工物质生活水平也有所提高。
    中央交通部为了总结经验，在今年四、五月份召开了汽车运输暨技术会议。会议根据各企业及劳动模范汇报，肯定了运动的成绩，批判了运输中的盲目性、保守思想以及忽视安全运输，忽视维护检修，忽视政治思想工作和单纯营利观点等不正确的经营思想，并着重总结了计划管理、安全驾驶、修理保养、节约燃料、延长轮胎寿命、改进机具等先进经验，制订了新的技术标准与操作规程，修订了各种技术经济定额。会议号召各地汽车运输企业继续提高企业经营管理水平，认真推行计划管理，增强托运计划的准确性，建立与健全作业计划与调度工作，并加强技术管理，开展技术革新运动，以确保安全运输，提高运输质量，继续降低成本与运价，完成与超额完成一九五四年的运输任务。
