Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 18th: The nine-nation delegations continued their discussions on the restoration of peace in Indochina at a restricted meeting of the Geneva Conference on June 18th. Another meeting will be held on June 19th regarding this issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 18th: Special correspondent for this agency reports: As previously reported, the proposals made by the Chinese delegation at the June 16th restricted meeting of the nine-nation delegations regarding the issues of Laos and Cambodia have aroused great interest from all parties. Public opinion generally believes that the hope of reaching an agreement has increased.

As everyone knows, the Chinese delegation's proposals are based on the actual situations in Laos and Cambodia and take into account the opinions of all parties. Their fairness, reasonableness, and relevance to reality are beyond doubt. According to available information, at the June 18th meeting, each delegation expressed its opinion on the Chinese delegation's proposals. The situation at the June 18th meeting showed that almost all delegations believed that the Chinese delegation's proposals were constructive and in the spirit of consultation, although some delegations still had some reservations. For example, the Laotian delegation believed that the Chinese delegation's proposals provided favorable conditions for work, had no points to oppose, and could be accepted as a basis for discussion. The Cambodian delegation believed that the Chinese delegation's proposals were in the spirit of consultation, with many points close to the views of the Laotian delegation. The French delegation believed that the Chinese delegation's proposals were reasonable, and some points were acceptable. The French delegation had no objections.

At the June 18th meeting, the only exception was the opinion of the US delegation. As is known, US representative Smith at the June 16th meeting considered the Chinese delegation's proposals to be "moderate, reasonable," and "many points were agreeable." However, at the June 18th meeting, US representative Robertson declared that this proposal was "unacceptable" to the United States. It was noted that Smith did not attend the June 18th meeting, and Robertson's statement was considered to be the official opinion of the United States, approved by the Washington authorities.

At the June 18th meeting, the Chinese delegation pointed out that Robertson's speech on the 18th and Smith's speech on the 16th were significantly different. The task Robertson was undertaking at the June 18th meeting was very clear. The Chinese delegation pointed out that the US representative wanted to provoke disputes to prevent an agreement from being reached. The Chinese delegation stated that it was not difficult to deal with this challenge but preferred to work towards reconciliation to reach an agreement in principle.

The Soviet delegation also pointed out that the US representative's speech raised many questions. The US representative seemed to feel there was a danger of reaching an agreement, a danger of finding common ground, and therefore wanted to threaten others. The Soviet delegation believed that there was no need to fear the possibility of reaching an agreement; on the contrary, efforts should be made to overcome difficulties and reach an agreement. The Soviet delegation also pointed out that it was strange that delegations directly concerned considered the Chinese delegation's proposals could serve as a basis for discussion, but the US representative opposed doing so.

People here generally felt that the route followed by the US delegation was not to reach any agreement. Once the possibility of reaching an agreement appeared, the US delegation would sabotage it. People remember that such a situation occurred when an agreement was reached on May 29th regarding the meeting of representatives of both command headquarters to study the deployment of the two sides' troops after the cessation of hostilities. Now, when the conference is approaching an agreement due to the Chinese delegation's constructive proposals, the threat of US sabotage has reappeared. This deserves serious vigilance.

At the June 18th meeting, some delegations raised some different opinions while discussing the Chinese delegation's proposals. The Laotian and Cambodian delegations also put forward their own proposals.

In response to the opinions of some delegations, the Chinese delegation pointed out at the meeting that the Chinese delegation's speech and proposals at the June 16th meeting were very clear and did not allow for any misunderstanding. There are two aspects to the situation in Laos and Cambodia. On the one hand, there are indeed resistance armies led by the resistance government; on the other hand, due to the war, both sides have had foreign troops enter, or foreign troops have entered in the past, and some have already withdrawn. Now, in order to achieve a genuine and effective ceasefire, an agreement should be reached on the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Laos and Cambodia, just as an agreement should be reached in Vietnam. The Chinese delegation believed that in order to facilitate a principled agreement on the Lao and Cambodian issues and to facilitate consultations between the two sides' command headquarters, the original text of Article 2 of the Chinese delegation's June 16th proposal (i.e., representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties should begin direct negotiations in Geneva and locally on issues related to the cessation of hostilities within the territories of Laos and Cambodia) was appropriate. Because this would include the opinions put forward by all parties, which is conducive to discussion and resolution. The Chinese delegation also believed that a ceasefire in the three Indochinese countries must be achieved simultaneously; one country cannot have a ceasefire while another does not; otherwise, there cannot be a genuine ceasefire. The Chinese delegation also believed that international supervision of the ceasefire should be implemented in the three Indochinese countries. This principle applies not only in Vietnam but also in Laos and Cambodia, but the special circumstances of each country should be taken into account. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believed that the Chinese delegation's proposals had a positive effect on the conference. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully agreed with this proposal. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that some delegations had noticed the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Laos and Cambodia during the discussion. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had long put forward this principle. As far as Vietnam is concerned, there used to be Vietnamese volunteer soldiers fighting in Cambodia and Laos, but these troops have already withdrawn from the two countries. If these troops still exist now, they should naturally also withdraw. However, the resistance armies of the Cambodian and Laotian people exist there, and this is undeniable. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that it is dangerous if some delegations do not recognize these facts and do not consider a reasonable solution to this issue. The fact is that in many parts of Laos and Cambodia, there are resistance forces, which are organized by the local people themselves and are gradually developing and growing. The representatives of Laos and Cambodia cannot treat these resistance armies as defeated parties and disarm them. These resistance armies are not only not defeated, but they are far from giving up their weapons and are victoriously fighting for national independence and freedom. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believed that the facts should be recognized, and the national liberation movements in Laos and Cambodia should be recognized, as well as the resistance armies of the local people. Therefore, the issue should not be considered based on the unilateral opinions of the representatives of Laos and Cambodia, but rather the opinions and suggestions of the Chinese delegation should be taken as the basis for discussion, because this proposal takes into account the opinions of all parties.

The Soviet delegation pointed out that the Chinese delegation's proposals have moved the conference forward in discussing the issues of Laos and Cambodia. On many points, the opinions of the delegations have become closer. The Chinese delegation's proposals and the proposals of the Laotian and Cambodian delegations certainly have differences, but they also have common points. The Soviet delegation believed that there was reason to believe that the three proposals could be merged. The Soviet delegation pointed out that it is difficult to deny that there are national liberation movements in Laos and Cambodia. Some people put forward some so-called "facts" that clearly only exist in their imagination. The Soviet delegation believed that the issue is not whether to determine which facts are acceptable and which need to be clarified, but whether to resolve the issue through war or negotiations. The Soviet delegation is concerned with restoring peace in Indochina and is willing to see disputed issues resolved through consultations between the directly concerned parties. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the resolution passed by this conference on May 29th led to the start of talks between the representatives of the two sides' command headquarters. Now, we should continue to move forward in this direction and make the same resolutions on the issues of Laos and Cambodia.

According to available information, the participating delegations agreed that the next meeting will seek common ground on the Chinese delegation's proposals and the Laotian and Cambodian delegations' proposals to reach a resolution that is acceptable to everyone.

It is reported that political issues were also discussed at the June 18th meeting. The Chinese delegation supported the six-point proposal on political issues made by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 16th. The Chinese delegation pointed out that although political issues have not been specifically discussed in the previous discussions of this conference, in fact, the speeches of the representatives of all participating countries have also involved many political issues. In terms of restoring peace in Indochina, military issues and political issues are interconnected and cannot be completely separated. The Chinese delegation believed that only when political issues are resolved can peace in Indochina be consolidated and lasting. Therefore, the Chinese delegation suggested that this conference should set a date to discuss political issues based on the proposals of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    日内瓦会议关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的讨论
    各国代表认为我建议富有建设性
    唯有美国代表团表示反对，企图阻挠达成协议
   【新华社日内瓦十八日电】九国代表团在日内瓦会议六月十八日的限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。关于这一问题，将在六月十九日再举行会议。
   【新华社日内瓦十八日电】本社特派记者报道：前已报道，中国代表团在六月十六日九国代表团限制性会议上提出的关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的建议，引起了各方的极大兴趣。舆论界普遍认为，达成协议的希望增长了。
    如大家所知道的，中国代表团的建议是根据老挝和柬埔寨的实际情况并考虑到了各方的意见而提出的，其公正、合理以及切合现实是无可怀疑的。据已获得的消息说，在十八日的会议上，各代表团都对中国代表团的建议表示了意见。十八日会议的情况表明：几乎所有的代表团都认为中国代表团的建议是富有建设性和协商精神的建议，虽然某些代表团还有若干保留意见。例如，老挝代表团认为，中国代表团的建议对工作提供了有利的条件，并没有可以反对之点，可以被接受为讨论的基础。柬埔寨代表团认为，中国代表团的建议具有协商的精神，有许多地方与老挝代表团的意见相接近。法国代表团认为中国代表团的建议是合理的，其中有些点是可以接受的。法国代表团并无反对意见。
    在十八日会议上，唯一例外的是美国代表团的意见。如已知道的，美国代表史密斯在六月十六日的会议上曾认为中国代表团的建议是“温和的、合理的”，“许多地方是可以同意的”。然而，在十八日的会议上，美国代表罗伯逊却宣称这个建议是美国“不能接受的”。人们注意到，史密斯没有出席十八日的会议，罗伯逊的声明被认为是经过华盛顿当局批准了的美国的正式意见。
    中国代表团在十八日会议上曾指出：罗伯逊十八日的发言和史密斯十六日的发言有显著的不同。罗伯逊在十八日会议上担任的任务是很清楚的。中国代表团指出，美国代表想挑起争论，使协议不能达成。中国代表团表示对付这种挑战并不困难，但宁愿致力于求得和解，以期在原则上达成协议。
    苏联代表团也指出，美国代表的发言引起了许多问题。美国代表似乎感觉到有达成协议的危险，有找到共同点的危险，因而要威胁别人。苏联代表团认为，无需害怕达成协议的可能性，相反，应该设法克服困难，达成协议。苏联代表团还指出，奇怪的是：直接有关各国的代表团都认为中国代表团的建议可以作为讨论的基础，但是美国代表却反对这样做。
    此间人士普遍感觉到，美国代表团遵循的路线是不要达成任何协议。一旦出现达成协议的可能性时，美国代表团就加以破坏。人们记得，在五月二十九日达成关于双方司令部代表会晤研究停止敌对行动后的双方军队的部署问题的协议时，就曾发生这样的情况。现在，当会议由于中国代表团的建设性的建议而接近于达成协议时，美国的破坏威胁又出现了。这是值得严重警惕的。
    十八日的会议上有些代表团在讨论中国代表团的建议时提出了一些不同的意见。老挝和柬埔寨代表团也提出了自己的建议。
    在回答某些代表团的意见时，中国代表团在会上指出，中国代表团在十六日会议上的发言和建议是很清楚的，不容有任何误解。在老挝和柬埔寨有两方面的情况，一方面确实有抵抗政府所领导的抵抗军队；另一方面，由于作战关系，双方都有外国军队的进入；或者曾经有外国军队的进入，而且有的已经撤出。现在为要达到真正的有效的停战，应该达成一切外国武装力量从老挝和柬埔寨撤退的协议，正如同在越南要达成的协议一样。中国代表团认为，为了便利于在老挝和柬埔寨问题上达成原则协议，使双方司令部便于协商，中国代表团六月十六日建议的第二条原文（即交战双方司令部的代表就有关在老挝和柬埔寨境内停止敌对行动的问题在日内瓦并在当地开始直接谈判）是适当的。因为这样就可以把各方面所提出的意见包括进去，利于讨论解决。中国代表团还认为，印度支那三国的停战必须同时实现，不能一国停战而另一国不停战，否则，就不能有真正的停战。中国代表团还认为，国际监察停战应实施于印度支那三国，这一原则不仅在越南，而且在老挝和柬埔寨也适用，但是要照顾到各该国的特殊情况。越南民主共和国代表团认为，中国代表团的建议对会议有积极的作用。越南民主共和国代表团完全同意这个建议。越南民主共和国代表团指出，在讨论过程中有些代表团注意到外国军队从老挝和柬埔寨撤退的问题。越南民主共和国代表团早就提出了这个原则。就越南方面而言，过去曾有越南人的志愿军在高棉和寮国作战，但是这些军队已经撤出两国。如果现在还有这些部队，自然也应撤出。然而，那里存在着高棉和寮国人民的抗战军队，这是不容否认的。越南民主共和国代表团指出，有些代表团不承认这些事实，不考虑这个问题的合理解决，那是危险的。事实是在寮国和高棉的许多地方，都有抗战部队，他们是当地人民自己组织起来的，而且在逐渐发展壮大。老挝和柬埔寨的代表不能把这些抗战军队看做战败者那样要解除他们的武装。这些抗战军队非但不是战败者，而且他们远非放弃武器，而是正在胜利地为民族独立和自由而斗争着。越南民主共和国代表团认为，应该承认事实，承认寮国和高棉都有民族解放运动，都有当地人民的抗战军队。因此，不能根据老挝和柬埔寨代表之单方面的意见来考虑问题，而应以中国代表团的意见和建议为讨论的基础，因为这个建议是考虑到各方面的意见的。
    苏联代表团指出，中国代表团的建议使会议在讨论老挝和柬埔寨问题上前进了一步。在许多点上，各代表团的意见接近了。中国代表团的建议和老挝及柬埔寨代表团的建议当然有分歧点，但是也有共同之点。苏联代表团认为，有理由设想三个建议是可以融合的。苏联代表团指出，很难否认在老挝和柬埔寨有民族解放运动。有些人提出一些显然仅仅存在于想像中的所谓“事实”。苏联代表团认为，问题不在于应否确定那些事实可以接受，那些需要澄清，而在于是用战争还是用谈判来解决问题。苏联代表团关心的是恢复印度支那和平，愿意看见有争论的问题由直接有关方面协商解决。苏联代表团指出，本会议五月二十九日通过的决议导致了双方司令部代表会谈的开始。现在应继续按这个方向前进，对老挝和柬埔寨问题作出同样的决议。
    据已获得的消息说，与会代表团同意下次会议将就中国代表团的建议和老挝及柬埔寨代表团的建议寻求共同之点，以达成大家都可以接受的决议。
    据悉，十八日的会议上还讨论了政治问题。中国代表团支持越南民主共和国代表团六月十六日关于政治问题的六点建议。中国代表团指出，在本会议的历次讨论中，虽然没有专门讨论政治问题，然而事实上在与会各国代表的发言中，也都涉及了许多政治问题。就恢复印度支那和平而言，军事问题与政治问题是互相关联而不可能完全分开的。中国代表团认为，只有政治问题获得解决，印度支那的和平才能巩固和持久。因此，中国代表团建议本会议应确定日期，以越南民主共和国代表团的建议作为基础，对政治问题进行讨论。
