    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China Embody the Superiority of the Socialist Democratic System
    He Li
    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China not only records the achievements of the people's democratic revolution over the past century but also greatly improves our existing democratic system. Our constitution is a socialist type of constitution, and the democracy stipulated in our Draft Constitution is also a socialist democracy with great superiority.

    What is the most fundamental difference between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy? Stalin said in "Foundations of Leninism": "Democracy under the capitalist system is capitalist democracy, democracy for the exploiting minority, based on restricting the rights of the exploited majority and aimed against this majority. Only under the dictatorship of the proletariat is it possible for the exploited to enjoy true 'freedom', for the proletarians and peasants to truly participate in state administration. Democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat is proletarian democracy, democracy for the exploited majority, based on restricting the rights of the exploiting minority and aimed against this minority.” ("Problems of Leninism," pp. 48-49, People's Publishing House edition)

    Although Stalin's explanation compares the Soviet Union under the dictatorship of the proletariat with capitalist countries, the characteristics of proletarian democracy that he expounds are basically also the characteristics of our democracy. Because today China is a new democratic country, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and belongs to the socialist type of country. Since its establishment in 1949, our country, because the working people have become the main body of the country and have grasped state power, has been carrying out economic recovery and construction according to socialist principles and gradually transitioning to socialism. This stipulates that our country's democratic system belongs to the socialist type and has fundamental differences from capitalist democratic systems.

    Since the democratic system stipulated in the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China belongs to the socialist type, it must have the superiority of the socialist democratic system. This superiority is mainly manifested in two aspects: first, all power of the state belongs to the people, and second, the people enjoy full democratic rights.

    All Power of the State Belongs to the People

    The people of our country have supreme power in the country's political life. Article 2 of Chapter 1 of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." Sections 1 and 4 of Chapter 2 also stipulate the functions and powers of the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels. Through the National People's Congress, the people can amend the Constitution; enact laws; supervise the implementation of the Constitution; elect the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, decide on the choice of candidates for the State Council, and have the right to dismiss them; and have the right to decide on all important events related to the people of the whole country.

    The people's power stipulated in our Draft Constitution is something that the people of all capitalist countries do not have and cannot have. The bourgeoisie once put forward the slogans of democracy and civil rights during the democratic revolution, but from the very first day the bourgeoisie stepped onto the national stage, it tried everything possible to break its own promises. As Lenin wrote in "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky": "Bourgeois democracy, although it has made great historical progress compared with the medieval system, it is always – and under capitalism cannot but be – narrow, truncated, hypocritical, and sanctimonious democracy, paradise for the rich and a trap and deception for the poor and exploited." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 2, p. 438)

    In the world, only the Soviet Union, which practices the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the people's democratic countries led by the proletariat can truly enable the people to grasp state power. Because the bourgeoisie relies on state power to suck the blood and sweat of the working people, it is most afraid of the working people grasping state power. The proletariat relies on state power to seek welfare for the working people, and only by truly enabling the working people to grasp state power can the development of the social economy be promoted.

    Therefore, the democratic systems of the Soviet Union and our country have a major characteristic that is fundamentally different from that of capitalist countries, that is, they stipulate in the Constitution the state organizational form that enables the people to fully exercise their power. This form, in the Soviet Union, is the Soviet of Workers' Deputies (Soviet means "council"), and in our country, it is the People's Congress. Without this organizational form, all the provisions on the people's power in the Constitution will become empty words. Capitalist countries superficially say that parliament represents the people's power, but in reality, parliament does not represent the people.

    Our country's People's Congress system has incomparable superiority over the parliamentary system of capitalist countries. Its most important characteristic lies in the unity of legislative and executive power. According to Article 21 of the Draft Constitution: "The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China is the highest organ of state power." Article 22 stipulates: "The National People's Congress is the sole organ exercising the legislative power of the state." Article 47 stipulates: "The State Council of the People's Republic of China, that is, the Government of the People's Republic of China, is the executive organ of the highest organ of state power and the highest organ of state administration." These three articles stipulate that our National People's Congress not only has independent legislative power itself but also directly controls executive power. Although the State Council is the highest administrative organ of the state, it is only the executive organ of the National People's Congress and must perform its tasks in accordance with the decisions of the National People's Congress and is subject to the supervision of the National People's Congress and its standing committee. In this way, due to the unity of legislative and executive power, all the power of the state is concentrated in the hands of the people, and the people can directly manage the state.

    The parliaments of capitalist countries only have legislative power, and executive power can completely separate from and be independent of the parliament. For example, the President of the United States and the British Cabinet have their independent executive power. The President of the United States' veto power can veto congressional bills because he has different opinions. Moreover, the administrative organs of many countries also have their own legislative power, and the legislative power of the British Cabinet is even increased to the greatest extent. The parliaments of capitalist countries simply have no power to supervise the activities of the administrative organs. Due to the separation of legislative and executive power, parliament degenerates into a "talking shop" that decorates false democracy. The real power to manipulate the state is not the people, nor is it the parliament, but the monopoly capital groups. As Stalin said in "Conversation with the First American Workers Delegation": "...as long as financial pressure is applied, government officials fly from their posts as if possessed by a demon. This is the real manipulation of the government by the banks, unlike the false control of Congress."

    Of course, such a parliamentary system cannot be allowed in countries led by the working class. It is necessary to get rid of this system and create another system that unifies legislative and executive power. Regarding this point, Marx had already proposed it during the Paris Commune, and Lenin elaborated on it in "State and Revolution" based on Marx's instructions: "The way out of parliamentarianism is, of course, not to abolish representative institutions and the electoral principle, but to convert the representative institutions from talking shops into 'working' bodies. 'The Commune should be a working, not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 2, pp. 199-200. The quotation in the text is Marx's words.) Therefore, the Soviet of Workers' Deputies in the Soviet Union and the People's Congress in our country have adopted a system that combines legislative and executive power to facilitate the people's direct exercise of power to manage the government. Regarding the benefits of combining legislative and executive power, Lenin said: "In the institution which the Commune was to substitute for corrupt, rotten parliamentarism, freedom of opinion and discussion does not degenerate into deception, for here the members of parliament must themselves work, must themselves execute their own laws, must themselves verify their results in actual life, and must themselves be directly responsible to their constituents." (Ibid., p. 201)

    The representatives of our country's People's Congress, like the representatives of the Soviet Union's Soviets, have another point that is particularly worth mentioning, that is, the representatives must be responsible to the voters. According to the provisions of Articles 23, 38, 56, and 61 of the Draft Constitution, the people have the right to elect their own representatives, and at the same time, they also have the right to supervise and replace their representatives, so that the representatives must obey the will of the people. However, the representatives of the parliaments of capitalist countries do not bear any responsibility to the people. In his speech at the voters' meeting in the Stalin electoral district of Moscow City on December 11, 1937, Stalin described a peculiar relationship between the representatives of the parliaments of capitalist countries and the voters: "When elections are held, the representatives flirt with the voters, flatter them, swear that they are absolutely loyal, and utter a lot of various promises. It seems that the representatives are completely dependent on the voters. As long as the election has been held and the candidate has become a representative, this relationship changes fundamentally. It is not the representative who depends on the voters, but the representative who is completely independent. For four or five years, that is, until the next election, the representative feels completely free, independent of the people, independent of his own constituents. He can turn from one camp to another, he can turn from the right path to the evil path, he can even do some not very clean tricks, he can somersault at will – he is independent." This shows that the representatives elected by the people of capitalist countries do not bear any responsibility to the voters, and the people have no right to supervise their own representatives. No wonder their representatives are most easily bought by monopoly capital, and the parliament composed of such representatives is of course extremely easy for monopoly capital to manipulate. Therefore, the parliament, cabinet, and president of capitalist countries faithfully serve the bourgeoisie, or even only serve a very small number of monopoly capitalists.

    The representatives of our country's People's Congress must be responsible to their electoral units and voters. As in the Soviet Union, the function of the voters does not end with the election but continues throughout the entire period of the current People's Congress. Therefore, the representatives do not have their own independence. The People's Congress composed of such representatives can of course become a true people's representative organ and an organ for the people to exercise power.

    The People Enjoy Full Democratic Rights

    Our citizens enjoy all the political, economic, and cultural rights that the citizens of all capitalist countries do not enjoy. Such as the right to work, the right to rest for workers, the right for workers to receive material assistance when they are old, sick, or lose their ability to work, the right to education, the right to elect and be elected, as well as freedom of person, religious belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration, etc. It is particularly worth mentioning that the provisions on our citizens' right to work, the right to rest for workers, the right to education, and the right for workers to receive material assistance when they are old, sick, or lose their ability to work can only be found in socialist-type constitutions, but are impossible in all capitalist countries' constitutions. Although the exercise of these rights in our country is currently only possible to expand gradually because economic construction has just begun and social material conditions are not fully available. However, our country's economy is led by the socialist state-owned economy, the entire national economy is subject to the socialist basic economic law, our country's social production will continue to grow and improve, and the people's material and cultural needs will gradually be met to the greatest extent. It will not produce economic crises, as well as the destruction of productive forces caused by crises, causing unemployment and poverty for the working people. Therefore, the rights stipulated in our Draft Constitution have reliable material guarantees. With the development of the country's socialist construction, it will enable citizens throughout the country to gradually and extensively enjoy these rights. In capitalist countries, the working people cannot enjoy these rights. The capitalist economic system constantly creates a large number of unemployed people and throws them into the streets. Before the start of World War II, the number of unemployed people in various capitalist countries reached 20 to 30 million each year. Due to the recent economic crisis, American imperialism has caused massive unemployment among workers. According to the estimate of Varga, an academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, there are currently about 6 million fully unemployed people in the United States, and the number of semi-unemployed people is even greater. The situation of American farmers has become unprecedentedly serious, and medium and small capitalists have also been hit by the crisis. The crisis is still developing. The capitalist economic system cannot give the people these rights.

    The other political rights enjoyed by our citizens are also incomparable to those enjoyed by the citizens of capitalist countries. Such as the right to elect and be elected. According to Article 86 of the Draft Constitution, except for people with mental illness and people who are deprived of the right to elect and be elected in accordance with the law, "Citizens of the People's Republic of China who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of their nationality, race, sex, occupation, social origin, religious belief, education level, property status, and length of residence, have the right to elect and be elected."
  "Women have equal rights with men to elect and be elected." In the national grassroots elections that our country has just victoriously completed, the registered voters in the electoral districts account for 97.18% of the total population over the age of 18 in the electoral districts, and the voters who participated in the voting account for 85.88% of the total number of registered voters. The number of women voters who participated in the voting accounted for 84.01% of the total number of registered women voters. This shows that our citizens have full electoral rights. However, capitalist countries impose heavy restrictions on the people's elections. For example, the election laws of various states in the United States stipulate that voters must have certain property, must pay poll taxes; must be literate, and even stipulate that they must be able to read the Constitution; voters must have
  a certain period of residence. In many states, blacks, soldiers, and women cannot get the right to vote at all. In the seven southern states alone, nearly 11 million blacks and white proletarians are deprived of the right to vote, and nearly 20 million people are deprived of the right to vote nationwide. Every election season, the lackeys of monopoly capital chase after the voters everywhere, carrying out shameless intimidation and bribery, and can even arbitrarily deprive voters of their right to vote. In the 1948 presidential election, out of 93 million voters, only more than 48 million people participated in the election. In the 1950 congressional election, only 40 million people participated in the election. Elections in capitalist countries are manipulated by a small number of people, and the working people have no right to free elections at all. As for the so-called freedom of person, speech, publication, assembly, and association, due to the increasing fascism of capitalist countries, it has become a foul-smelling fig leaf.

    Stalin said in his 1952 "Speech at the Nineteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union": "In the past, the bourgeoisie sang the praises of liberalism and defended the freedom of bourgeois democracy, thereby building up its prestige among the people. Now, not even a shadow of liberalism remains. The so-called 'personal freedom' no longer exists – now, only those who possess capital are recognized as having personal rights, while all other citizens are treated as human material only suitable for exploitation. The principle of equality between people and equality between nations has been trampled upon; this principle has been replaced by the principle that the exploiting minority enjoys full rights while the exploited majority of citizens has no rights at all."

    The banner of bourgeois democracy has been discarded. But in our people's China, the Communist Party has raised high the banner of democracy – the banner of socialist democracy, leading the people of the whole country towards socialism.

    We Must Uphold the People's Democratic Dictatorship

    The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China not only stipulates that all power of the state belongs to the people, enabling the people to enjoy full democratic rights, but also stipulates in the Draft Constitution that in order to protect the people's democratic system, it is necessary to suppress all treasonous and counter-revolutionary activities, punish all traitors and counter-revolutionary elements; stipulate that the state deprives feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists of their political rights within a certain period of time in accordance with the law; stipulate that the state prohibits all illegal acts by capitalists that endanger public interests, disrupt social economic order, and undermine state economic plans. These are of extreme importance to ensuring the democratic life of our people. The facts of the past four years have proven that if our country does not carry out land reform and suppress the counter-revolutionary movement, if landlords and despots are not overthrown, and if bandits and special agents are not wiped out, the people cannot be the masters of their own affairs. If we do not carry out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, and if the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks are not repelled, our new democratic system will inevitably be destroyed. The Paris Commune, which suffered a tragic defeat in history, was destroyed because they were "lenient" to class enemies after seizing power. Therefore, Lenin told us in "State and Revolution" that we cannot limit ourselves to expanding democracy. In addition to expanding democracy on a large scale to become the first democracy enjoyed by the poor and the democracy enjoyed by the people, we must also implement many means of depriving freedom to the oppressors and exploiters. Lenin also said: "Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and the forcible suppression, that is, exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and oppressors of the people – this is the modification of democracy during the transition from capitalism to communism." ("Selected Works of Lenin," Two-Volume Edition, Vol. 2, p. 237) These words are worth remembering deeply by each of us.

    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China consolidates the democratic rights that our people have already obtained and points out the path forward for the people of the whole country. Under the shining light of our country's Constitution, the people of the whole country will continue to advance towards a higher level of socialist democracy.

    中华人民共和国宪法草案体现了社会主义民主制的优越性
    贺笠
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，不仅纪录了全国人民一百多年来民主革命所已经获得的成果，而且把我国现有的民主制度大大地提高了一步。我国的宪法是社会主义类型的宪法，我国宪法草案所规定的民主制也是属于具有极大优越性的社会主义的民主制。
    社会主义的民主制和资本主义民主制最根本的区别是什么呢？斯大林在“论列宁主义基础”中说：“资本主义制度下的民主是资本主义的民主，是剥削者少数底民主，是以限制被剥削者多数底权利为基础，是以反对这多数为目标的。只有在无产阶级专政下，被剥削者才有可能享受真正‘自由’，无产者和农民才有可能去真正参加国家管理。无产阶级专政下的民主是无产阶级的民主，被剥削者多数底民主，是以限制剥削者少数底权利为基础，是以反对这个少数为目标的。”（“列宁主义问题”第四八页至四九页，人民出版社版）
    斯大林这个解释虽然是以无产阶级专政的苏联和资本主义国家对比来说的，但他所阐述的无产阶级民主的特点，基本上也是我国民主的特点。因为今天中国是新民主主义国家，是工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，是属于社会主义类型的国家。我们的国家，由于劳动人民已成为国家主体，掌握了国家权力，自一九四九年成立，就已按照社会主义原则进行经济恢复和建设，并且逐步过渡到社会主义。这就规定了我们国家的民主制是属于社会主义类型，而与资本主义民主制有原则上的区别。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案所规定的民主制，既然是属于社会主义的类型，它就必然具有社会主义民主制的优越性。这种优越性主要表现在两个方面：第一，国家的一切权力属于人民，第二，人民享有充分的民主权利。
    国家的一切权力属于人民
    我国人民在国家政治生活中具有最高无上的权力。中华人民共和国宪法草案第一章第二条规定：“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”第二章第一节、第四节又规定全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的职权，人民通过全国人民代表大会可以修改宪法；制定法律；监督宪法的实施；选举中华人民共和国主席，决定国务院人选，而且有权罢免他们；一切有关全国人民的重要事件它都有权决定。
    我国宪法草案所规定的人民权力，是一切资本主义国家人民所没有，而且也不可能有的。资产阶级在民主革命时曾提出过民主和民权的口号，但是自从资产阶级登上国家舞台最初的一天起，就想尽一切办法毁弃他自己的诺言。正如列宁在“无产阶级的革命与叛徒考茨基”一书中所写的：“资产阶级的民主制较之中世纪制度虽有伟大的历史进步作用，但它始终是——而且在资本主义之下不能不是——狭窄的，残缺的，虚伪的，假仁假义的民主，对于富者为天堂，对于贫人和被剥削者为陷阱为骗局。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第二卷第四三八页）
    在世界上使人民真正能够掌握国家权力的，只有实行无产阶级专政的苏联和以无产阶级为领导的人民民主国家。因为资产阶级依靠国家权力来吸吮劳动人民的血汗，它是最怕劳动人民掌握国家权力。而无产阶级依靠国家权力来为劳动人民谋福利，只有使劳动人民真正掌握国家权力才能推进社会经济的发展。
    因此，苏联和我国的民主制都具有一个与资本主义国家根本不同的重大的特点，就是在宪法上规定了使人民能够充分行使权力的国家组织形式。这种形式，在苏联就是劳动者代表苏维埃（苏维埃即会议的意思），在我国是人民代表大会。如果没有这种组织形式，宪法中一切对人民权力的规定，都将变成一纸空文。资本主义国家在表面上说代表人民权力的是议会，但在实际上议会并不代表人民。
    我国人民代表大会制度比资本主义国家议会制度具有不可比拟的优越性，它的一个最为重要的特点就在于立法权和行政权的统一，根据宪法草案第二十一条规定：“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关。”第二十二条规定：“全国人民代表大会是行使国家立法权的唯一机关。”第四十七条规定：“中华人民共和国国务院，即中华人民共和国政府，是最高国家权力机关的执行机关，是最高国家行政机关。”这三条规定，使我国全国人民代表大会不仅本身具有独立的立法权，而且直接控制着行政权。国务院虽是最高国家行政机关，但它只是全国人民代表大会的执行机关，必须根据全国人民代表大会的决定执行任务，而且受着全国人民代表大会及其常设机关常务委员会的监督。这样，由于立法权与行政权的统一，就使国家的一切权力都集中在人民手里，人民就可直接管理国家。
    资本主义国家的议会只有立法权，行政权完全可以脱离议会而独立。如美国的总统和英国的内阁都有它独立的行政权。美国总统的否决权可以因自己有不同的意见而否决国会的法案。而许多国家的行政机关还有它自己的立法权，英国内阁的立法权更增加到极大限度。资本主义国家的议会对于行政机关的活动简直没有进行监督的权力。由于立法权与行政权的分立使议会堕落到装饰虚伪民主的“清谈馆”的地位，真正操纵国家大权的不是人民，也不是议会，而是垄断资本集团。正如斯大林在“与第一届美国工人代表团谈话”中所说：“……只要施用财政的压力，政府大员就由他们的岗位上飞舞起来，好似着魔一样。这是银行对于政府真正的操纵，和国会的假控制不同。”
    当然，在以工人阶级为领导的国家是不能容许这样的议会制度的，必须摆脱这种制度，而另外创立一种立法权与行政权统一的制度。关于这一点，马克思早在巴黎公社的时候就已提出，列宁在“国家与革命”一书中曾根据马克思的指示加以阐述：“摆脱国会制的出路，当然不在于取消代表机关和废除选举制，而是在于把代表机关由清谈馆变为‘工作的’机关。‘公社应当不是国会式的，而是同时兼任立法和行政的工作团体。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第二卷第一九九页至二○○页。文中的引文是马克思的话）因此在苏联的劳动者代表苏维埃和我国的人民代表大会都采取了立法权与行政权合一的制度，以便于人民直接行使权力管理政府。关于立法权和行政权合一的好处，列宁说：“在公社用以代替资本主义社会那贪污腐败的国会制的机关中，论断和讨论的自由不会堕落为骗局，因为议员们应当亲自来工作，亲自来执行自己通过的法律，亲自来检查在实际生活中所得的结果，亲自来直接对选举者负责。”（同上书第二○一页）
    我国的人民代表大会的代表，和苏联苏维埃的代表一样，还有一点特别值得提出的，就是代表必须对选民负责。根据宪法草案第二十三、三十八、五十六、六十一各条的规定，人民有权选举自己的代表，同时也有权监督、撤换自己的代表，这样就使代表必须遵从人民的意志。但是资本主义国家议会的代表并不对人民负任何责任。斯大林在一九三七年十二月十一日在莫斯科城斯大林选区选民大会上的演说中，曾这样描写资本主义国家议会的代表和选举人之间的一种奇特的关系。他说：“当着进行选举的时候，代表向选举人献媚眼，向他们阿谀逢迎，睹咒发誓说自己绝对忠实，说出一大堆各种各样的诺言。看来，代表是完全依赖于选举人的。只要选举已经举行，而候选人已变成代表的时候，这种关系就根本改变了。不是代表依赖于选举人，而是代表完全独立。在四年或五年间，即直到下次选举时为止，代表是觉得自己完全自由，不依赖于人民，不依赖于自己选举人的。他可以从一个营垒转到另一个营垒中去，他可以从正路上转到邪路上去，他甚至可以干一些不很清白的勾当，他可以任意打筋斗，——他是独立的。”这说明资本主义国家人民所选举的代表并不对选民负什么责任，人民也无权监督自己的代表，无怪乎他们的代表最容易为垄断资本所收买，由这样的代表所组成的议会当然又极便于垄断资本的操纵。因此，资本主义国家的议会、内阁和总统都是忠实为资产阶级服务，甚至只是为极少数垄断资本家服务的。
    我国的人民代表大会的代表必须向他的选举单位和选举人负责，也如苏联一样，选举人的职能并不以选举而终结，而是在本届代表大会存在的整个时期内都继续着的，因此代表并没有自己的独立性。由这样的代表组成的代表大会，当然就能够成为真正的人民代表机关，成为人民执行权力的机关。
      人民享有充分的民主权利
    我国公民享有一切资本主义国家公民所享受不到的政治、经济、文化各方面的权利。如劳动的权利，劳动者的休息的权利，劳动者在年老、疾病或丧失劳动能力时有获得物质帮助的权利，受教育的权利，选举和被选举的权利，以及人身、宗教信仰、言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由等等。特别值得提出的是我国公民的劳动的权利、劳动者的休息的权利和受教育的权利，以及劳动者在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力的时候，有获得物质帮助的权利，这些权利的规定只有在社会主义类型的宪法里才可能有，而在一切资本主义国家宪法里是不可能有的。虽然这些权利的行使，在我国目前由于经济建设刚刚开始，社会物质条件还不充分具备，因而还只能逐步扩大。但是我国的经济是以社会主义的国营经济为领导的，整个国民经济受着社会主义基本经济法则的支配，我国的社会生产将不断地增长和完善，人民的物质和文化需要将逐渐获得最大限度的满足。它不会产生经济危机，以及由危机所引起的生产力的破坏，引起劳动人民的失业和贫困。因此我国宪法草案所规定的这些权利是有着可靠的物质保证的。它将随着国家的社会主义建设的发展，使全国公民能够逐步扩大地享受这些权利。在资本主义国家，劳动人民是不能享受这些权利的。资本主义的经济制度经常制造出大批失业者，并把他们抛在街头。第二次世界大战开始前，各资本主义国家的失业者每年达两千万至三千万人之多。美国帝国主义最近由于经济危机的降临，已引起工人大量的失业，据苏联科学院院士瓦尔加的估计，目前美国完全失业者已达六百万人左右，半失业者还要更多。美国农民的处境已空前严重起来，中、小资本家也已受到危机的打击，目前危机还在发展。资本主义的经济制度是不可能给予人民这些权利的。
    我国公民所享受的其他政治方面的权利，也是资本主义国家公民所不能相比的。如选举权和被选举权，根据宪法草案第八十六条规定，除有精神病的人和依照法律被剥夺选举权和被选举权的人外，“中华人民共和国年满十八岁的公民，不分民族、种族、性别、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰、教育程度、财产状况、居住期限，都有选举权和被选举权。”
  “妇女有同男子平等的选举权和被选举权。”我国刚刚胜利完成的全国基层选举，在选举地区所登记的选民，要占选举地区十八周岁以上人口总数的百分之九十七点一八，参加投票的选民占登记选民总数的百分之八十五点八八。妇女选民参加投票的占登记的妇女选民总数的百分之八十四点零一。这说明我国公民的选举权是充分的。但是资本主义国家对于人民的选举则给予重重的限制，如美国各州的选举法，规定选民必须有一定的财产，必须缴纳人头税；必须识字，甚至规定要能阅读宪法；选民要有
  一定的居住日期。有很多州的黑人、士兵、妇女根本得不到选举权利，仅在南部七个州，黑人和白人无产者被剥夺选举权的就将近一千一百万，全国被剥夺选举权的近两千万人。每到选举时期，垄断资本的走卒到处追逐着选举人，进行无耻的恫吓和收买，甚至可以任意剥夺选民的选举权利。一九四八年选举总统，在九千三百万选民中，参加选举的人只有四千八百多万人，一九五○年选举国会，参加选举的人只有四千万人。资本主义国家的选举是被少数人操纵的，劳动人民根本没有什么自由选举的权利。至于所谓人身、言论、出版、集会、结社等自由，由于资本主义国家日益法西斯化，那已成为一幅臭不可闻的遮羞布了。
    斯大林一九五二年“在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说”中说：“从前，资产阶级高唱自由主义，维护资产阶级民主的自由，从而在人民中间为自己树立了声望。现在，连自由主义的影子也一点没有了。所谓“个人自由”已经不再存在了，——现在，仅仅那些拥有资本的人们才被承认有个人权利，而其他的一切公民则被当作只适于供剥削的人料。人们平等和民族平等的原则被践踏了；这种原则已代之以从事剥削的少数人享有充分权利而公民中被剥削的大多数人则毫无权利的原则。”
    资产阶级民主的旗帜已经被抛在一边了。但是在我们人民的中国，共产党则高举起了民主的旗帜——社会主义民主的旗帜，领导着全国人民向着社会主义迈进。
      必须坚持人民民主专政
    中华人民共和国宪法草案不只是规定国家的一切权力属于人民，使人民享有充分的民主权利，而且为了保护人民民主制度，在宪法草案中又规定要镇压一切叛国的和反革命的活动，惩办一切卖国贼和反革命分子；规定国家依法律在一定时期内剥夺封建地主和官僚资本家的政治权利；规定国家禁止资本家的危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为。这些对保障我国人民民主生活有着极为重要的意义。四年多来的事实证明，如果我们国家不进行土地改革和镇压反革命运动，地主恶霸不打倒，土匪、特务不肃清，人民是不可能当家作主的。如果不进行“三反”“五反”斗争，资产阶级的猖狂进攻不打退，我们的新民主主义制度就难免被破坏。历史上曾经遭受惨痛失败的巴黎公社，就是由于他们在夺取政权以后，对阶级敌人“宽大为怀”，致遭覆亡。所以列宁在“国家与革命”中告诉我们，不能仅仅以扩大民主制为限。除了把民主制大规模地扩大成为第一次供贫民享受的民主制，供人民享受的民主制而外，还要对压迫者、剥削者实行许多剥夺自由的手段。列宁并说：“使绝大多数民众享有民主，而以强力镇压那些剥削和压迫人民的份子，即是把他们摒除于民主制之外，——这便是从资本主义进到共产主义的过渡时期内的那种民主制。”（“列宁文选”两卷集，第二卷第二三七页）这话值得我们每个人深刻记取。
    中华人民共和国宪法巩固了我国人民已经取得的民主权利，指示了全国人民前进的道路。全国人民将在我国宪法的光辉照耀下，向更高级的社会主义的民主制继续迈进。
