    Fishermen on the Zhoushan Fishing Ground
    Catch 400,000 Dan of Large Yellow Croaker
    On the Zhoushan fishing ground, fishermen have already caught 400,000 dan of large yellow croaker. The majority of these large yellow croakers have already been transported by the supply and marketing cooperative's refrigerated ships to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places. The remaining portion is being processed into salted fish by processing plants in various fishing ports and will soon be transported to Jiangxi, Anhui, North China, and Northeast China to supply the needs of the people.
    This year, due to abnormal weather conditions, the large yellow croaker season on the Zhoushan fishing ground arrived later than in previous years. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of fish, the fishermen going out to sea are working hard to "go out to sea early, return to port late, and cast nets more often." Many fishermen are also responding to the call of the Zhoushan Fishing Ground Production Headquarters and have decided to fish for twenty days after the usual large yellow croaker season. Currently, more than 20,000 fishermen are continuing to fish at sea.

    舟山渔场上的渔民
    捕到大黄鱼四十万担
    在舟山渔场上，渔民已捕到大黄鱼四十万担。这些大黄鱼大部分已由供销合作社的冰鲜船运往上海、杭州和宁波等地，其余部分正由各渔港的加工场腌制成咸鱼，即将运到江西、安徽、华北和东北等地，供应人民需要。
    舟山渔场今年大黄鱼汛由于气候反常，鱼来得比往年迟。为了争取鱼产丰收，出海渔民都努力做到“早出海、晚归港、多下网”。许多渔民并响应舟山渔场生产指挥部的号召，决定在通常的大黄鱼汛期后再捕二十天。目前有两万多渔民正继续在海上捕鱼。
