U.S. and French Colonialists and the "Dirty War"
The Misfortune of "L'Express Weekly"

On the night of May 27th, the Paris police suddenly sealed off "L'Express Weekly" and confiscated the fifty-fourth issue of "L'Express Weekly," which was scheduled to be published on May 29th. It is said that this was because "L'Express Weekly" leaked some military secrets and angered the highest French authorities. What military secrets did the fifty-fourth issue of "L'Express Weekly" leak? It is reported that this issue of the weekly published the report of the "inspection team" sent by the French government to Indochina. The report stated: "The inspection team found that France's 'war card' was worse than expected," "The fall of Dien Bien Phu had a serious impact on the morale of (French colonial) officers and soldiers," "The hope of organizing a Vietnamese (Bao Dai) army that can play an important role in the war has been completely shattered," and so on.

Of course, the "leak" of the French colonial army's embarrassing situation in the Indochina War was not conducive to Mr. Bidault's display of a "victorious" posture at the Geneva Conference. Therefore, not only did "L'Express Weekly" suffer the misfortune of being "sealed off," but also, due to the implication of the "L'Express Weekly" incident, the French Secretary of State, Jacquinot, had to "resign" from his post.

A Secretary of State for Less Than Ten Hours

According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on June 1st, after Jacquinot, the Secretary of State in charge of Indochina's "Federal Member States" and a member of the de Gaulle faction, was dismissed, another de Gaulle figure, Hummel, who was newly appointed, hastily resigned after less than ten hours in office. Reuters called Hummel's tenure "the shortest in French political history." It is said that Hummel's resignation was the result of a vote against him by most members of de Gaulle's Republican Union for Social Action. De Gaulle's parliamentarians believed that since their own man, Jacquinot, had fortunately escaped the post, it would be too foolish for Hummel to take responsibility. The de Gaulle faction is a well-known right-wing faction in the French ruling group, and now they are unwilling to take on the affairs of the Indochina "Federal Member States." From this, it can be seen how isolated the Lanier clique, which attempts to continue the Indochina War with the support of the United States, is within the French parliament!

An Accounting of the Lanier Government

Recently, Wall Street applauded the French rulers' decision to forcibly recruit 80,000 young men domestically to continue the "dirty war." On May 30th, the Associated Press also said in a telegram: "This emergency conscription can provide France with 20,000 trained troops, a number greater than the number of troops (French colonial army) killed or captured at Dien Bien Phu."

Indeed, anyone can calculate that 20,000 so-called trained troops (assuming it is as easy as the Associated Press says) is certainly more than the 16,000-plus French troops annihilated at Dien Bien Phu. However, how many times can the Lanier government withstand the annihilation of "16,000-plus people"? Of course, Wall Street does not care about this, because it is French youth who are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves. But the Lanier government should do its accounting properly!

Someone Provides Money, But No One Sells Their Life

On June 2nd, a staff officer named Nguyen Van Hung of the Bao Dai puppet army said to his subordinates: "Before the end of this year, the growth and development of the National Army (Bao Dai puppet army) will surprise you," "The National Army will soon enter a new stage." There is a reason why Nguyen Van Hung suddenly started bragging. According to a United Press dispatch from Hanoi on May 31st, the American boss has "reached an agreement" with the Bao Dai puppet army headquarters, promising to train five divisions of troops for Bao Dai before the end of this year. However, less than two days after Nguyen Van Hung's boasting, the Saigon correspondent of the American "New York Times" said that on June 3rd, Bao Dai's puppet Minister of Defense, Phan Huy Quat, had already admitted that his deceptive mobilization for the conscription plan had "failed."

This failure should be said to have been expected. Because although Wall Street is willing to provide money, the Vietnamese people are unwilling to sell their lives! (Attached picture)

### 美法殖民者和“肮脏的战争”

    美法殖民者和“肮脏的战争”
    “快报周刊”的厄运
    五月二十七日夜晚，巴黎的警察突然查封了“快报周刊”，并把将在五月二十九日出版的第五十四期“快报周刊”没收了。据说，这是因为“快报周刊”泄露了什么军事秘密，触怒了法国最高当局。五十四期的“快报周刊”泄露了什么军事秘密呢？据悉：这一期的周刊曾刊载了法国政府派往印度支那的“视察团”的报告，这个报告中写着：“视察团发现法国的‘战争王牌’比预料的更为糟糕”、“奠边府的失陷使得（法国殖民军）官兵的士气受到严重的影响”、“组织一支能够在战争中起重要作用的越南（保大）军队的希望已经完全覆灭了”等等……。
      当然，法国殖民军在印度支那战争中狼狈情况的“泄露”，对在日内瓦会议上摆“胜利”驾子的皮杜尔先生是不利的，因此，不仅“快报周刊”遭到了“查封”的厄运，而且由于“快报周刊”事件的牵连，法国政府的国务秘书雅盖也不得不“引咎辞职”了。
    不到十小时的国务秘书
    据路透社巴黎六月一日电讯消息，负责印度支那“联邦成员国”事务的国务秘书、戴高乐派的雅盖丢官以后，新任命的另一个戴高乐派人物许米特兰走马上任不到十个小时，就匆匆地辞职了。路透社把许米特兰的任职称为“法国政界历史上任职期间最短的一次”。据说许米特兰的辞职是由于戴高乐的社会行动共和联盟内部大多数成员投票反对的结果，戴高乐派的议员们认为，既然他们的自己人雅盖幸运地摆脱了这个职务，许米特兰再去承担责任那就未免太笨了。戴高乐派是法国统治集团中著名的右派，现在都不愿担负印度支那“联邦成员国”的事务。由此可见，企图依靠美国继续进行印度支那战争的拉尼埃之流在法国国会内部是如何的孤立！
    拉尼埃政府的一笔账
    最近，法国统治者为继续进行“肮脏的战争”而决定在国内强拉八万名壮丁以后，华尔街曾经大加喝采。五月三十日，美联社在一则电讯里也说：“这次紧急征兵行动可以使法国得到两万名经过训练的军队，这个数目比在奠边府战死或被俘的军队（法国殖民军）数目为多”。
    不错，任何人都能算出，两万名所谓经过训练的军队（假定能像美联社说的那么容易），当然比法国在奠边府被歼灭的一万六千多人要多。但是，拉尼埃政府能经得住几次“一万六千多人”的被歼灭呢？当然，华尔街是不管这些的，因为流血牺牲的是法国青年。但拉尼埃政府却应该好好地算算账！
    有人出钱，没人卖命
    六月二日，一个叫阮文兴的保大伪军的参谋长对他的下属说：“在今年年底以前，国民军（保大伪军）的壮大和发展将使你们大吃一惊”，“国民军不久将进入新阶段”。阮文兴突然吹起牛来是有原因的。据合众社河内五月三十一日电讯报道，美国老板已同保大伪军司令部“获致协议”，答应在今年年底以前给保大训练五师军队。但是，阮文兴的牛皮吹过不到两天，美国“纽约时报”驻西贡的记者就说，保大的伪国防部长潘辉凯在六月三日已经承认，他为征兵计划而进行的骗人的动员工作已经“失败了”。
    这种失败应该说是意料中的事情。因为虽然华尔街愿意出钱，但是越南人民却不愿意卖命！（附图片）
