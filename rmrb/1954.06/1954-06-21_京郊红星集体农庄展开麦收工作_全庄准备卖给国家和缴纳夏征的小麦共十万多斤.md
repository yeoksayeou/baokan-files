    Red Star Collective Farm in the Suburbs of Beijing Begins Wheat Harvest
    The Entire Farm Prepares to Sell Over 100,000 Jin of Wheat to the State and Pay Summer Grain Tax
    The members of the Red Star Collective Farm in the suburbs of Beijing have completed their preparations for the wheat harvest and have begun the intense work of harvesting wheat on over two thousand mu of wheat fields. Twenty-two threshing grounds have been prepared, and the management committee has uniformly procured all necessary equipment from the supply and marketing cooperative. The swivel-arm horse-drawn harvester for harvesting densely planted wheat has been installed with the help of workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. The workers from the machinery factory carefully taught the farm members how to use it. A portion of the densely planted wheat will be harvested by machine by the tractor station. The members of the farm management committee and the members of each small team have studied the contract system for harvesting wheat; professors and students from the Agricultural University and technicians from other units who are interning at the farm are guiding the farm members in selecting and retaining superior varieties.
    Based on the wheat's growth, the farm has made a preliminary estimate of the yield, and after discussion by the management committee and the leaders of each small team, a method for distributing the wheat harvest has been determined. The farm's more than 2,700 mu of wheat fields are estimated to have an average yield of 130 jin per mu, with a total yield of more than 350,000 jin. After deducting wheat seeds for the farm's own use, returning wheat seeds to farm members themselves, and taking care of some elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed farm members, the farm plans to sell over 100,000 jin of wheat to the state and pay the summer grain tax, with the remaining portion being distributed according to the farm members' workdays.

    京郊红星集体农庄展开麦收工作
    全庄准备卖给国家和缴纳夏征的小麦共十万多斤
    北京郊区红星集体农庄的庄员们，已完成了麦收准备工作，在二千多亩的麦地上，展开了紧张的麦收工作。二十二个打麦的场地已整理出来，场里用具也已由管理委员会统一向供销合作社置办齐备。收割密植小麦的摇臂式马拉收割机在华北农业机械总厂工人的帮助下安装起来了，机械总厂的工人仔细地教会了庄员们使用的方法。一部分密植小麦，并将由拖拉机站用机器收割。农庄管理委员会的委员们，和各小队的庄员们研究了收割小麦的包工办法；在农庄实习的农业大学的教授、同学们以及其他各单位的技术人员们，正在指导农庄庄员选留优良品种。
    农庄根据小麦成长的情况，初步估计了产量，并经管理委员会和各小队长的讨论，作出了麦收分配办法。全庄二千七百多亩麦地，估计每亩平均产量可达一百三十斤，总产量可达三十五万多斤。除去庄内自留麦种、归还庄员自己麦种、照顾部分老弱孤寡的庄员外，农庄准备卖给国家和缴纳夏征的小麦有十万多斤，剩余部分则按庄员劳动日进行分配。　（陈铸）
