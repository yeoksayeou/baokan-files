Title: US Conspiracy to Swiftly Interrupt Negotiations on the Korean Question

    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 3rd (Special Correspondent Shen Jiantu) – Negotiations on the Korean question have been deadlocked for six weeks. The head of the US delegation, Smith, told American reporters here on the 2nd that the conference on the Korean question must be quickly interrupted because the US is in an unfavorable position. One of the reasons for the unfavorable US position is that the US has refused to withdraw foreign troops from Korea and stubbornly insisted that the belligerent parties supervise the elections with hostility, thus exposing the true face of the US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries. Another reason is that the US's stubborn position makes it difficult for Washington to force its allies to support this position without bearing the responsibility for sabotaging the conference.
    Before Smith spoke to the American reporters, the American propaganda machine had created an atmosphere for several weeks, clamoring that the negotiations on the Korean question were going to fail and threatening to interrupt the negotiations. American observers here always grimace when they hear that the Korean question might be resolved peacefully.
    Observers here point out that the US delegation is worried that if negotiations on a peaceful settlement of the Korean question continue, world opinion may force the US delegation to abandon its unacceptable demands, thereby reaching an agreement. Smith has recently failed to get the full support of Western allies to openly interrupt the negotiations. US sources indicate that the US's recent conspiracy is to find a way to bury the negotiations.
    The "New York Times" of May 31 stated that the Thai Foreign Minister in Geneva "will recommend that this Far East Conference interrupt negotiations on the Korean question, establish a seven-nation committee to study the issue," and "submit a report to the United Nations General Assembly." The newspaper said that Prince Wan Waithayakon believes that "the discussion of the Korean question at the conference may have to end." This is clearly another step in the US's conspiracy to use the United Nations to sabotage the negotiations. Western newspaper commentators point out that Thailand's actions are in collusion with the US's conspiracy to use the United Nations as a tool to undermine the Geneva Conference. This type of action is causing distrust among Asians, because it stems from US instigation.
    The US's refusal to negotiate puts its Western allies in a very difficult position: they must support impractical demands that are despised by the people of Asia. Since the beginning of the negotiations, American and British newspapers have deliberately avoided mentioning the US's refusal to withdraw US troops from Korea, which is the main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The "New York Times" correspondent in Geneva reported: "There is a general feeling here among observers and some non-communist delegations that the United States has failed on the Korean question." He went on to say that the proposals put forward by the North Korean and Chinese delegations "appear to neutral Asians as fair and reasonable plans for the reunification of Korea."
    Another reason for the US's eagerness to quickly end negotiations on the Korean question is the fear that its allies may become uncontrollable and put forward suggestions that differ from the US position, thereby further exposing the US's refusal to negotiate. The "New York Times" dispatch of May 27 confirmed this: "The United States, which leads the countries that participated in the Korean War on the UN side, is preventing some countries from putting forward their own specific proposals on the Korean question." Later, the US delegation instructed the Foreign Minister of the Syngman Rhee puppet regime to put forward a 14-point proposal to further deadlock the conference. These proposals only "received limited support among some UN member states participating in the Korean War." Subsequently, a British spokesman said at a press conference that these "proposals" were subject to "revision."
    Following this, it was widely rumored here that the US was trying to find an excuse to sabotage the negotiations at a "restrictive conference." One of its favorite excuses is to put forward the unacceptable demand that the United Nations supervise the Korean elections, and the so-called United Nations supervision is clearly American-made.
    The spokesman for the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea clearly stated at a press conference on the 2nd: "The Korean people will never agree to proposals that allow foreign interference in their internal affairs." The United Nations, as a belligerent party to the Korean War, signed the Korean Armistice Agreement and is therefore not qualified to conduct impartial supervision. The South Korean puppet Foreign Minister's request to allow US troops to remain in South Korea actually means US armed interference in the Korean elections.
    Nevertheless, the spokesman for the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea emphasized: We will continue to do our utmost to make this conference a success. All fair-minded observers recognize that the reasonable proposals of Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai have opened the door to a peaceful settlement of the Korean question. However, due to the US's refusal to negotiate, this door remains closed to this day. To break the six-week deadlock on the Korean question, the US delegation must abandon its unacceptable demand for interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.

### 美国阴谋迅速中断关于朝鲜问题的谈判

    美国阴谋迅速中断关于朝鲜问题的谈判
   【新华社日内瓦三日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道，关于朝鲜问题的谈判陷入僵局已经第六周了，美国代表团团长史密斯二日对此间的美国记者们说，由于美国处境不利，关于朝鲜问题的会议必须迅速中断。美国处境不利的原因之一是，美国拒绝自朝鲜撤退外国军队，顽固地主张交战一方对选举进行敌意监督，因而暴露了美国干涉亚洲国家内政的政策的真面貌。另一个原因是，美国的顽固的立场使得华盛顿很难一方面驱使它的盟国支持这种立场，同时又不负破坏会议的责任。
    在史密斯对美国记者发表谈话以前，美国宣传机关已经制造了几周的空气，叫嚣说，关于朝鲜问题的谈判是要失败的，并扬言要中断谈判。这里的美国观察家在听到朝鲜问题有可能解决时，总是做鬼脸。
    此间观察家指出：美国代表团耽心的是，假若关于和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判继续进行，世界舆论也许可能迫使美国代表团放弃它的不能被接受的要求，因而达成协议。史密斯最近没有得到西方盟国的充分支持以公开中断谈判。美国的消息表明，美国最近的阴谋是要找出埋葬谈判的办法。
    五月三十一日的“纽约时报”说，在日内瓦的泰国外交部长“将建议这个远东会议中断关于朝鲜问题的谈判，成立七国委员会来研究这个问题”，并且“向联合国大会提出报告”。这个报纸说，旺·威泰耶康亲王认为，“会议上朝鲜问题的讨论也许要结束”。这显然是美国要利用联合国来破坏谈判的阴谋的另一个步骤。西方报纸的评论指出：泰国的行动是和美国的利用联合国作为破坏日内瓦会议的工具这个阴谋串通一气的，这种行动正引起亚洲人的不信任，因为这种行动是出于美国的唆使。
    美国的拒绝谈判，使西方盟国处于一个很为难的地位：它们必须支持为亚洲人民所不齿的不切实际的要求。自从谈判开始以后，美国和英国报纸就故意不谈美国拒绝从朝鲜撤退美军的做法，而这种做法正是和平解决朝鲜问题的主要障碍。“纽约时报”驻日内瓦记者报道说：“这里的观察家和某些非共产党代表团中间有一种普遍的感觉，即：美国在朝鲜问题上失败了。”他接着说，北朝鲜和中国代表团“所提出来的建议，在中立的亚洲人看来，是重新统一朝鲜的公平合理的计划”。
    美国急于迅速结束关于朝鲜问题的谈判的另一个原因是，害怕它的盟国可能不受控制，迳自提出一些和美国立场不同的建议，从而更加暴露了美国的拒绝谈判的态度。“纽约时报”五月二十七日的消息就证实了这一点：“领导站在联合国一边参加朝鲜战争的国家的美国，阻止某些国家在朝鲜问题上提出它们自己的具体的建议。”后来，美国代表团指使李承晚的外务部长官提出了十四点建议来使会议进一步陷入僵局。这些建议只“在参加朝鲜战争的一些联合国会员国中得到有限的支持”。随后，英国发言人在记者招待会上说，这些“建议”是可以“修改的”。
    接着，此间就盛传：美国企图寻找借口在“限制性的会议”上破坏谈判。它的一个得意的借口就是提出由联合国监督朝鲜选举这一不能接受的要求，而所谓联合国监督显然是美国制的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团发言人二日在记者招待会上明确地说过：“朝鲜人民是永远不会同意容许外国干涉他们的内政的建议的。”联合国作为朝鲜战争的交战一方在朝鲜停战协定上签字，因而没有资格进行不偏不倚的监督。南朝鲜傀儡外务部长官所要求的让美国军队驻留南朝鲜，实际上就意味着美国武装干涉朝鲜选举。
    尽管如此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的发言人仍强调说：我们将继续竭尽全力使这个会议获得良好的结果。一切公正的观察家都认识到，南日外务相和周恩来外长的合理的建议为和平解决朝鲜问题打开了大门。但是，由于美国拒绝协商，这个大门直到如今还是被关着。要打破为时六周的朝鲜问题僵局，除非美国代表团放弃它的干涉朝鲜人民内部事务的这种不能接受的要求。
