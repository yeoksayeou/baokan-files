Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    Letter from Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column published on April 2nd contained a letter from Comrade Zhao Hui and others criticizing our office for not allocating materials on time after assigning the Mechanical Repair Factory "a task that must be completed on schedule." This criticism is correct, and we sincerely accept it.

    Due to the heavy basic construction tasks this year, we convened a repair meeting in November of last year and assigned a batch of repair tasks to the Kailuan Mechanical Repair Factory. Among them, fifteen clam-shell wagons (mistakenly written as twelve in the original criticism letter) were stipulated to be delivered on February 15th of this year, and it was decided to supply the materials immediately. However, because it was not determined at the time which department would submit the material plan, the materials were never allocated to the Mechanical Repair Factory. The Mechanical Repair Factory sent official letters three times urging the supply of materials and also contacted the mine companies and the Basic Construction Office. We inspected this matter in mid-January and held a balancing meeting at the Linxi Machinery Factory, deciding that the machinery factory would temporarily provide a portion of the materials, with the remainder to be allocated after the meeting. However, the materials were not delivered to the Mechanical Repair Factory until February 15th. This seriously affected the factory's production and the workers' morale, causing losses to the country.

    This incident reflects our insufficient understanding of the complexity of basic construction work and our bureaucratic attitude towards work, resulting in only assigning tasks without diligently solving problems for those below in a timely manner. We must use the lessons learned from this incident to examine the shortcomings in all aspects of our basic construction work and improve them.

### 开滦煤矿总管理处检讨拨料不及时的缺点

    开滦煤矿总管理处检讨拨料不及时的缺点
    开滦煤矿总管理处来信：四月二日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了赵惠等同志的来信，批评我处给机械制修厂布置了“一项必须按期完成的任务”后却不按期拨给材料。这个批评是正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    由于今年基本建设任务繁重，我们在去年十一月间召开了制修会议，给开滦机械制修厂布置一批制修任务。其中十五辆蛤子车（原批评信误为十二辆）规定在今年二月十五日交货，并决定立即供给材料。但由于当时没有确定由那个部门提出材料计划，因此材料一直没有拨到机械制修厂。机械制修厂曾三次用公函催促供料，并曾向矿井公司和基本建设处联系。我们在一月中旬检查了这件事，在林西机厂开了平衡会议，决定由机厂暂垫一部分材料，其余的会后拨去。但结果到二月十五日才将材料拨到机械制修厂。这样就严重地影响了该厂的生产和工人生产情绪，给国家造成了损失。
    这个事件反映了我们对基本建设工作的复杂性认识不足，用官僚主义态度对待工作，因而形成只布置任务，而不认真给下面及时解决问题。我们一定要根据这件事情的教训来检查我们基本建设各方面工作中的缺点，并加以改进。
