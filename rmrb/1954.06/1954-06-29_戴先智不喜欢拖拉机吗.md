Does Dai Xianzhi Dislike Tractors?
By Our Correspondent Liu Heng, Lin Mo

"What's going on?"

The first newly built agricultural machinery station in Southwest China—the state-run Pixian Agricultural Machinery Station—was about to bring in tractors the next day. On the afternoon of April 22, Luo Shifa, the head of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan, along with Cai Xi and other comrades stationed in the cooperative, were inspecting the fields, checking the route for the tractor to plow.

The rapeseed and wheat in the fields had not yet been harvested. The tractor was coming tomorrow to plow the *sweet potato vine* [Note] fields. Hearing that the tractor was coming, the cooperative members cut and carried, and in a few days, they harvested all the more than 70 mu of sweet potato vines. Luo Shifa and everyone looked at one place after another, pointing from time to time: "The tractor will come in from here, turn around at the end of that field, and then go to the field in front."

Several people turned onto the road. Cai Xi saw Dai Xianzhi, the leader of the Fifth Production Team, urging his ox to plow the field in the distance, and asked Luo Shifa, "Why is he plowing? Doesn't he know the tractor is coming tomorrow?" Luo Shifa said, "That field is small, and the tractor can't turn around inside, so it can only be plowed with an ox." As they talked, they walked to Dai Xianzhi's side. There they looked at two more fields: the one next to the road was a little over one mu, and next to it on the southeast corner was one that was more than five mu. The tractor had to come off the road and into this small field to plow that large field.

Cai Xi pointed to the two fields and called to Dai Xianzhi, "Dai Xianzhi, tell the team members that these two fields should be plowed by the tractor, so they don't have to waste their energy!"

"Got it," Dai Xianzhi replied indifferently, without even a smile on his face.

Cai Xi could see that the young man was a bit unhappy and said, "Dai Xianzhi, do you know that the tractor is coming tomorrow?"

"Got it," Dai Xianzhi raised his head and smiled, but the smile looked very unnatural.

Cai Xi felt a bit strange: "He wasn't like this in the past! In the past, this Youth League member would jump higher than anyone else when he heard about something new!"

Luo Shifa thought that the young man was tired from urging the ox and wanted him to take a break, so he called to him, "Come on, Dai Xianzhi! Let's go see how the tractor will enter the fields tomorrow!"

Dai Xianzhi grunted and dropped the plow to walk with everyone. However, after walking a short distance, he seemed to suddenly remember something and turned back to plow the field.

This time, even Luo, the cooperative leader who was usually best at understanding the members' feelings, couldn't figure it out: "What exactly is going on?"

"So that's what it is!"

That day, Dai Xianzhi had a heavy heart.

Dai Xianzhi and two others fed an ox, which was used by the three families in turn. The work points earned by the ox plowing the field for one day were equivalent to one person working for three days. Dai Xianzhi had long been hoping that it would be his turn to use the ox, so he could earn more work points. But who knew that it would be his turn just as the tractor was about to come!

Everyone knew the benefits of the tractor, right? Dai Xianzhi had told the team members more than once. But now, it just so happened to be his family's turn to use the ox, and the tractor was about to come!

When Luo Shifa and the others came to inspect the fields, Dai Xianzhi was feeling gloomy in the field. When he heard Luo Shifa calling him, he wanted to go with Luo Shifa and the others to look around, to clear his mind. However, after walking a short distance, he thought of his ox: "What's the point of going to play for a while? I won't even earn the work points for the ox!" Therefore, he turned back.

He finished plowing the field before it got dark. Dai Xianzhi was preparing to stop work and go home when he looked up and saw the two fields that were to be plowed by the tractor tomorrow. He thought, "If the tractor came a few days later, those two fields would have been plowed by my ox! The work points I would have earned would be more than I could earn in ten days!" As he led the ox home, the shadows of the two fields were still shaking in front of his eyes. At this moment, a thought occurred to him: "If I flood this small field, won't the tractor be unable to enter the muddy field! Then the large field inside will also be unable to be plowed!" However, he was afraid that doing so would be opposed by everyone. As he walked to his doorstep, he ran into his younger sister coming out. As soon as he saw his sister, he had an idea: "I'll get her to release the water. If someone complains, I'll say the child doesn't understand."

At dusk, Luo Shifa finished inspecting the fields and passed by the field where Dai Xianzhi was releasing water. He saw that the field was already flooded and understood a large part of what was going on: "Oh, so that's what it is!" If there weren't so many people waiting for him in the office to hold a meeting, he would have immediately gone to find Dai Xianzhi and ask him for an explanation.

After the meeting, Luo Shifa used a flashlight to knock on the door of Dai's house, asking them to drain the water from the field. After knocking for a long time, Dai Xianzhi's mother finally put on her clothes and opened the door. She said that her sons had already gone to bed, and also said:

"Cooperative Leader Luo, the field is already flooded, so let's just leave it at that! The tractor has plenty of fields to plow, why bother about these few mu?" Hearing this, Luo Shifa completely understood what was going on.

"He should be educated! He is a production team leader and a Youth League member, he should be educated!" Luo Shifa thought as he walked back, making up his mind.

"This is selfishness!"

That night, Dai Xianzhi didn't sleep well. When Luo Shifa came to knock on the door, he felt even more distressed, tossing and turning all night. When he got out of bed the next day, he didn't dare to go out to face people and just sat in the house in a daze. Suddenly, his younger brother, Dai Xiangui, ran in from outside. The news he brought back scared Dai Xianzhi even more!

It turned out that all nine production teams in the cooperative were holding meetings to discuss the matter of flooding the field. There was widespread discussion and severe criticism. Even the old men and women who usually didn't like to speak up were red-faced and furious.

"The People's Government is using tractors to help us with our work, and Dai Xianzhi is flooding the tractor, deliberately causing us trouble!"

"Is he still a team leader? He's not even qualified to be a cooperative member! He should be expelled and driven out of the village!"

Dai Xiangui roughly described the situation at the meeting outside. Then, he said, "Brother, do you still remember Article Five?"

Dai Xianzhi knew what he was asking and replied, "Oppose selfishness!"

"You put it too simply, let me read it to you..." In the past, this younger brother, who was also a Youth League member, never liked to say anything about his older brother, it was always Dai Xianzhi, who was both the team leader and the older brother, who would teach him a lesson. At the end of March, Dai Xiangui attended a training class for party members in the county for more than twenty days. After coming back, he was somewhat different and often gave his older brother advice. This time, he took out a book from the drawer that he had brought back from the party member training class: "The Eight Requirements of a Communist Party Member." As he flipped through it, he said:

"Brother, you used to say that the Youth League is the party's reserve force, and we should follow the requirements of party members and strive to join the party. Listen, this is Article Five of the party member requirements." Then he read on:

"All party members must place the public interest of the people, that is, the interest of the party, above their own private interests. The private interests of party members must be subordinate to the public interest of the people, that is, the party. All selfish people..."

Before he could finish reading, Dai Xianzhi rushed out the door. He ran to the flooded field and drained all the water. Then he hurried to the office, because they were waiting for him there to hold a cooperative affairs committee meeting.

At the meeting, Dai Xianzhi finished explaining the process of how he flooded the field, and then said: "This is selfishness, putting private interests above the public interest! I only thought that the cooperative has more than seventy mu of sweet potato vine fields, and flooding six or seven mu is less than one-tenth of the total. I didn't think that the cooperative has a total of more than one thousand one hundred and eighty mu of fields, and the tractor only plows more than seventy mu, which is not even a fraction of the total! I only saw my own ox, and I didn't see the entire cooperative's land! I'm still a team leader, and I'm still a Youth League member! If everyone learned from me, I... I..." He could not continue as his voice changed.

He is paving the way for the tractor

In the afternoon, there were many people on the road of the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative! People from the entire village had gathered, and even farmers from twenty or thirty li away had rushed over! Those who came first were crowding around the tractor, and those who came later were anxiously milling around outside.

This is it, this is it, this is the tractor! Look at it, its body is strong and solid, with a pair of glass eyes in the front, and two large plows behind its rear. It roars as it moves, with sound even louder than a car, and even more majestic than a car!

Old Man Shi, with his white beard, stroked the hair of a little child next to him and kept saying, "You guys are so lucky, so lucky!" Tears streamed down his face.

Dai Xianzhi was among the crowd. He no longer had the worried face of yesterday, nor did he have the appearance of wanting to cry this morning. He was also smiling and watching there. However, in the blink of an eye, how did he disappear from the crowd?

Where did he go?

It turned out that he had walked to the field that had been flooded. He was stepping on it with his feet, testing to see if the field had dried. Most of the area could already support a person, but in a few small areas, the soil was still soft, and his feet would sink in when he stepped on it.

Dai Xianzhi quickly brought over a few wooden boards and laid them on the areas where the soil was soft. Because in a little while, the tractor would be driving into this field.

[Note] *Sweet potato vine*, also known as pigweed, is a local spring crop that can be eaten as a vegetable or used to feed livestock.

    戴先智不喜欢拖拉机吗
    本报记者　刘衡　林沫
    “怎么回事？”
    西南第一个新建的农业机器站——国营郫县农业机器站的拖拉机第二天就要开进来啦。四月二十二日下午，四川新繁县新民农业生产合作社社长罗士发跟驻社干部蔡曦等同志在转田坎，查看拖拉机耕田的路线。
    田里的菜籽、麦子还没收割。明天拖拉机来，是耕苕子〔注〕田。听说拖拉机要来，社员们割的割，背的背，几天功夫，就把七十多亩苕子全部收割干净了。罗士发和大家看了一处又一处，不时地用手指点：“拖拉机从这边开进来，那边地头上打拐，再到前边那块田里去。”
    几个人转到了马路上。蔡曦远远看见第五生产队队长戴先智在吆着牛耕田，就问罗士发：“他怎么耕开了？他不知道拖拉机明天就来吗？”罗士发说：“那块田小，拖拉机到里边拐不过弯，只能用牛耕。”大家一路说着，走到了戴先智旁边。在那里又看了两块田：靠马路边上这一块有一亩多，紧靠这一块的东南角上，是一块五亩多大的。拖拉机下了马路，开进这块小田，才能去耕那块大田。
    蔡曦指着两块田，喊戴先智：“戴先智，给队员说声呀，这两块田要使拖拉机耕，免得他们费劲啦！”
      “晓得啦。”戴先智带理不理地回答了一声，脸上一笑也不笑。
    蔡曦看出小伙子有些不高兴，就说：“戴先智，你晓不晓得拖拉机明天就来了呀？”
      “晓得啦。”戴先智抬起头来笑了笑，可是笑得很不自然。
    蔡曦心里有些奇怪了：“往日他不是这样呀！往日这位青年团员，一听到什么新鲜事，比哪个都跳得高！”
    罗士发以为小伙子吆牛吆喝累了，想让他歇歇气，就喊他：“走啊，戴先智！一块儿去看看明天拖拉机来了怎么下田！”
    戴先智“嗯”了一声，丢下犁头跟大家一块儿走了。可是，走不多远，他好像是突然想起什么事情，又转身回去犁田去了。
    这一下，连平常最会摸社员心事的罗社长也摸不清了：“到底是怎么回事？”
    “原来是这个！”
    这天，戴先智有很重的心事。
    戴先智跟另外两家伙喂了一头牛，由三家轮流使唤。牛耕一天田挣的工钱要顶一个人做三天活，戴先智老早就在盼望牛轮过来，好多挣点工分。可是，谁知道，早不轮，迟不轮，刚刚拖拉机要来，牛就轮到他家了！
    拖拉机的好处，谁不知道呀？戴先智就跟队员们讲过不止一次。可是，现在，早不来，迟不来，偏偏轮到他家使牛，拖拉机就要来了！
    当罗士发他们来转田坎的时候，戴先智正在田里发闷，听到罗士发喊他，他本想跟罗士发他们一块儿到处转转，好散散心。可是，才走一节路，他又想起了他那一头牛：“去耍一阵顶啥？连一个钱的牛工都挣不回啦！”因此，他又转身走回去了。
    天还没黑，就把田耕完了。戴先智准备收工回家，抬头就看见了那两块明天要用拖拉机耕的田。他想：“要是拖拉机晚几天来，这两块田就该我的牛来耕哪！挣的工分呀，比我一个人做十天活还多！”他牵着牛往家走，那两块田的影子还在他眼面前乱摇乱晃，这时，他心头一动：“要是把这块小田淹上水，拖拉机不就是开不进稀泥巴田了吗！连里边那块大田也会耕不成啦！”可是，他又害怕这样做，会受到大家的反对。走到家门口，正碰见妹妹从里面走出来。他一看见妹妹，心里就有了主意：“叫她去放水好啦。要是有人反映，就说小娃不懂事。”
    傍黑，罗士发转完了田坎，走过戴先智放水的田边，他看见田里已是水汪汪的一片，一下把事情明白了一大半：“哦，原来是这个！”要不是办公室里好些人在等他开会，他马上会去找戴先智问个明白。
    开完会，罗士发打着手电筒到戴家院子叫门，要他们把田里的水放走。叫了半天，戴先智的妈才披衣出来把门打开。她说儿子们早就睡了觉，还说：
  “罗社长，田淹都淹了，那就算了嘛！拖拉机有的是田耕，还在乎这几亩？”罗士发听了这句话，就完全弄清楚这到底是怎么回事了。
      “应该教育！他是生产队长，又是青年团员，应该教育！”罗士发一边往回走，一边拿定了主意。
    “这就是自私自利！”
    这天晚上，戴先智并没有睡好觉。当罗士发跑来叫门的时候，他心里更是难过，翻腾了一夜。第二天爬下床，他还不敢出门见人，在屋子里直发呆。忽然，他的弟弟戴先贵从外面跑了进来。他带回的消息呀，更是把戴先智吓坏了！
    原来全社九个生产队都在开会讨论这件放水淹田的事。到处都在纷纷议论，严厉批评。连平时不爱吭气的老大爷、老大娘也一个一个说得脸红气胀。
    “人民政府用拖拉机给我们帮工，戴先智水淹拖拉机，是存心整我们哪！”
      “他还是队长？连社员条件都不够！应该开除，赶出村去！”
    戴先贵把外边开会的情形大概讲了讲。之后，他说：“哥呀，你还记得第五条吧？”
    戴先智晓得他问的是什么，就回答：“反对自私自利呗！”
      “说得太简单了，你听我念一遍……”以前，这位也是青年团员的弟弟从来不爱说哥哥什么话，总是这位又是队长，又是哥哥的戴先智在教训他。三月底，戴先贵到县上的党员训练班受了二十几天训。回来之后，他就有些不同了，常常也给哥哥提个意见。这一次，他从抽屉里找出了一本从党员训练班带回来的书：“共产党员的八个条件”。他一边翻，一边说：
      “哥呀，你往日老说青年团是党的后备军，我们应该跟着党员的条件走，争取入党。你听，这就是党员条件第五条。”接着他往下念：
      “一切党员必须把人民群众的公共利益，即党的利益，摆在自己私人的利益之上，党员的私人利益必须服从人民的即党的公共利益。一切自私自利的人……”
    没等念完，戴先智就冲出门了。他跑到那块淹了水的田里，把水全部放走。又赶紧跑到办公室里去，因为那儿正在等他开社务委员会。
    会上，戴先智讲完了他放水淹田的经过，接着又说：“这就是自私自利，把私人利益摆在公共利益之上呀！我光想到合作社有七十多亩苕子田，淹上六、七亩，连十分之一都不到。我就没想一想：合作社一共有一千一百八十多亩田，拖拉机才耕七十多亩，连个零头都没有呀！我光看到自家的牛，就没看到整个合作社的地！我还是队长呀，还是青年团员呀！要人人都学我，我……我……”说到后面，他声音都变了，说不下去了。
    他在给拖拉机铺路
    下午，新民农业生产合作社的马路上，好多人呀！全村的人都围拢来了，连二、三十里路外的农民也赶来哪！先来的人都挤在拖拉机的周围，后来的人急得在外边乱打转。
    这就是呀，这就是呀，这就是拖拉机呀！你看它呀，身子壮壮实实，前头一对玻璃大眼，屁股后面拖上两匹大铧，走起路来轰轰直响，比汽车的声音还大，比汽车还要威武呀！
    白胡子的史六爸用手摸着旁边一个小娃的头发，不住嘴地说：“你们倒好啊，好啊！”眼泪就流下来了。
    人群里，有戴先智。他已经不是昨天那付发愁的面孔了，更不是今天上午那个要哭的样子了。他也在那儿笑，在那儿看。可是，只一袋烟的功夫，人群里怎么就看不见他了？
    他到哪里去了？
    原来他走到了那块被水淹过的田里。他在用脚踩，用脚试，看看田晒干了没有。大部分地方已经能够站得住人，只有几小块地方，土泡软了，踏进去还拔不出脚。
    戴先智赶紧抱来了几块木板，铺在土被泡软的地方。因为一会儿，拖拉机就要开进这块田里来啦。
      〔注〕“苕子”又名猪草，是当地一种小春作物，
