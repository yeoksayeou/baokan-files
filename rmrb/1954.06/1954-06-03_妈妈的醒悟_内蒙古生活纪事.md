Mother's Awakening
    ——A Chronicle of Life in Inner Mongolia
    Li Yi

Biligen the old woman deeply believed in the gods, just as she believed in any ordinary truth of life—such as the ticks biting as painfully as needle pricks. In her view, the gradually improving life since Liberation, and the health of her one and only boy, Daoerji, a member of the Youth League, were all blessings from the gods—from Heaven!

After a rare heavy snowstorm of many years, many weak ewes and lambs died. The real reason was this: last autumn, they had not built up enough fat reserves; before lambing, there were many consecutive days of moving around; and the shelters to protect against wind and snow were poorly constructed. Although the specific circumstances varied from household to household, the only publicly acknowledged reason was: the human effort had not been enough.

Biligen the old woman, like those who devoutly believed in the gods, believed that this was the will of Heaven, that Heaven was angry.

She said such things to people:
      "Heaven knows best. In recent years, the livestock on our Hulunbuir grassland, especially the sheep, have been breeding too fast. Heaven wants to take some back..."

    "Heaven, I dare not ask you to leave too many livestock. You watch our fate and leave what you will. As long as we can keep enough sheep to eat meat, and one dairy cow to make milk tea, we will be content..."

Thus, Biligen the old woman, who usually participated in labor, was unwilling to pay attention to the feeding of those weak ewes and lambs that had lost their mothers. She fell into a state of being at the mercy of fate, expecting a severe blow. Her back, which was usually fairly straight, was now hunched over. Her eyes scanned everything around her blankly. Her whole body seemed to gather strength in only one thing: scattering milk and milk tea into the sky, squinting and praying to Heaven.

Biligen the old woman's boy, Daoerji, was a member of the Youth League. He had been educated at school and had always been an active member in various tasks in the district. His view of the snowstorm disaster was naturally different from his mother's.

Daoerji thought with melancholy:
    "Having such a backward mother at home, the mother who raised me, believing in Heaven so much that she doesn't even bother to look at the sheep, how embarrassing! People, especially comrades in the Youth League, will laugh at me like this: 'Haha! His mother is so superstitious...' But what can I do?"

Daoerji gradually stepped from the narrow path of his own thoughts onto the broad road.
      "I must have a good talk with her... I should use ironclad facts to show her, to shake her fatalistic thinking from the heart, just like uprooting a tree, so the tree falls cleanly."

On the fourth night after the heavy snowstorm, when the reddish-purple moon rose solemnly from the cloud net on the eastern horizon, Daoerji brought fifteen or sixteen lambs that had lost their mothers, one after another, from the sheepfold, bound their waists with broken felt pieces, and placed them in a large circle around the stove. The lambs, because they were weak and had no mother's milk to eat, emitted a kind of sorrowful cry in unison. Daoerji patiently fed them one after another with a feeding device made of cow horn. He held the lambs in his arms, like a gentle woman. The mother, however, was still praying to Heaven and Earth, showing an unusual aversion to the lambs' cries, as if afraid that the lambs' cries would scare away the spirits she was about to invite down.

She finally said excitedly:
      "You quickly take them back to the sheepfold. These annoying things, listening to their cries, can they even survive? Heaven won't let them live, so it took away their mothers. Humans can't keep suckling creatures alive!... Don't think that putting them by the stove will help. The stove fire can't do much. Those that are meant to live will live even in a heavy snowstorm. That's what happened in the spring of the second year after the Japanese were defeated at Nomonhan: the large and small sheep that were penned up in the sheepfold and yurt all died, but those that were swept away by the wind and snow, not one of them died!..."

People don't have time to talk in the most urgent labor. Daoerji was like that too. At first, he didn't pay any attention to his mother's words. In his mind, he was only thinking about how to rescue this group of lambs. "There will always be a time to talk to mother clearly... Feeding this batch of lambs alive is better than talking to her for half a day. Anyway, this is something that will 'work' in a few days." He secretly rejoiced at his work. However, once, being incautious, he even laughed out loud at his mother's devout prayer. This aroused his mother's dissatisfaction.

      "Good! You're laughing at me, you bad boy. You must know that laughing at me is also laughing at the gods! The gods won't spare you. If you don't believe me, just watch, there will definitely be retribution..."

Biligen the old woman deliberately expanded the power of the gods, glaring, as if she were the god herself.

Words stuck in the throat are itchy and panicky if not spoken. Daoerji was like that at this time. He suddenly had an idea:
  "I'm busy with this (rescuing sheep), and mother is busy with that (praying), we must explain it clearly. One's own mother should walk the same path as oneself." Thus, a debate began.
   "Mother, you say every day that the death of livestock is the will of Heaven, that people can't do anything about it. I ask you, have you really seen Heaven? What kind of thing is it?" Daoerji said to his mother with a half-smile. As soon as he said these words, memories of his childhood immediately surfaced in his mind. He thought, "I seem to have returned to when I was a child. At that time, I only acted spoiled with my mother, speaking without knowing the depth, sometimes making her angry for half a day. Now I'm grown up, and I'm still like this to her... But the home of a Youth League member, the mother of a Youth League member, should also be progressive. How can these things not be made clear?"

Biligen the old woman was silent for a moment, pursing her lips several times, clearly taken aback by the too rude words that her son suddenly said. However, when she slowly moved her gaze to her son, the congealed words finally came out.

    "Child, you are sinning by saying this! Can't you see Heaven? Last year, not a single one of our lambs died. What is that if not the will of Heaven? What you eat and wear is all given by Heaven. You don't thank Heaven, but instead scold Heaven, you are a really bad boy!"

    "Mother, let me ask you another question," Daoerji blinked, smiling, obviously intentionally teasing his mother. "How many livestock will Heaven let us die this year?"

Biligen the old woman eagerly threw the words back to her son, as if counterattacking:
      "Heaven can't tell you yet. It won't tell you until June. Before then, if you don't properly worship Him, maybe almost all the livestock in our family will die. It's just like people often say: when you're old, if all the livestock dies, you can only move with your belongings strapped to a dog's neck..."

Daoerji felt that what his mother said was funny. He thought to himself, "Take this opportunity to expose her old secrets."

    "Mother, you're still talking about Heaven. What you're talking about isn't Heaven. Who doesn't know that in June, the grass will grow tall, and the livestock will have green grass to eat, so they won't die. Is that what you mean by Heaven!..."

Biligen the old woman became angry because of her son's words and became excited.

     "You bad child, you are not talking to me properly, you are intentionally trying to anger me. You must know that if you anger me, Heaven will not spare you either. Don't think that you are feeding so many lambs by the stove, none of them will live. If you don't believe me, just watch, they will all die within three days. Heaven wants to take them back, mortals can't stop it... In a few days, you won't even be able to squeeze much milk, the cow's milk will dry up. Heaven will make you unable to even borrow milk from the cow!"

    "Okay, then let's see if this group of lambs can survive. You pray for yours, and I'll feed my lambs. Just like you said, it will 'work' in less than three days."

An unpleasant argument ended there. Biligen the old woman was still passive, depressed, and waiting. Except for eating, she prayed, holding her pipe, smoking one bag after another, taking a deep breath, then exhaling with a sound, watching the smoke gradually disappear from thick to thin, flowing from the yurt to the sky window, and then flying with the wind to an unknown place. Daoerji, because he had made a bet with his mother, was even more enthusiastic about raising the lambs. During the day, in addition to helping others feed weak ewes in the sheepfold, or grazing sheep on the grassland, he sat in front of the stove, feeding the lambs one by one, tying the felt pieces on their bodies, singing cheerful tunes to the lambs, and watching their gradually active movements with full enthusiasm, thinking in his heart, "Maybe this is my achievement, according to mother's words, this may be the retribution the gods give me. The retribution is that the lambs are all alive..." At night, he changed the habit of sleeping next to his mother that he had for many years, pulling the carpet close to the lambs, stroking them with his hands, listening only to their cries, without sleeping peacefully all night, his eyelids were swollen, and he ate very little, occasionally taking one or two pieces of dried milk from the hanging cabinet, soaking some milk tea and eating it... He really looked like a tender mother. In his heart, the competitive spirit of when he was a child and played the game of breaking sheep leg bones with his companions, hitting hard several times in a row, fearing that it would not break, was like the small grass on the spring grassland, wriggling under a layer of dry yellow grass crumbs.

Biligen the old woman, because of her child's few words, silently became angry, just like milk in a pot that had boiled, uncontrollably bubbling upwards.

      "He is my own son, my one and only child, not adopted... I have held him in my arms since he was a child, washing, brushing, sewing, and connecting him after he peed and pooped, and I don't know how many tens of thousands of times I have sung the 'Bu Wai' [note] tune. I never thought that he would anger me like this... I care about him so much, but he angers me..."

Biligen the old woman recalled her care for her child since childhood, and a feeling of grievance surged up. This memory was like a deep abyss that went deeper and deeper, like a tape without a head, slowly and painfully unfolding in her fragile heart. A recent event vividly surfaced.

Yes! Not many days ago, Daoerji and other members of the mutual aid team brought back a large cart of willow branches to cover the sheepfold, Biligen the old woman greeted him with a smile, brushed the sand and soil off his body, and warmed some water for him to wash his face. As soon as Daoerji sat down by the stove, Biligen the old woman quietly brought him a large silver bowl of milk tea with dried milk and milk skin, watching the child eat and drink with a smile on her face. Because Daoerji crisply chewed the dried milk, Biligen the old woman also felt a kind of fragrance... As soon as Daoerji finished drinking the milk tea and chewing the last piece of dried milk, Biligen the old woman brought a large basket of dry cow dung from outside, added a large handful to the stove, washed her hands, and began to make meat noodles.

    "Should I put more or less dried meat?" Biligen the old woman asked pleadingly.

    "Mother, you decide," Daoerji replied gently with a sense of gratitude.

    "The meat in spring has a bit of a taste, it's not as delicious as fresh meat, so less..."
      "..." Daoerji only stroked his mother with his eyes, without saying anything.

A kind of happy tenderness rippled between mother and son.

Biligen the old woman pondered over this matter for a long time. Her heart was like the spring ice, gradually melted by a warmth. It was also like milk that had boiled but the lid had not been lifted, dousing the fire below so that it was about to go out. She gradually understood her child's actions from her maternal instinct. She was really taking steps of thought along a wide road.

    "...Maybe the child is somewhat right. How could one's own child deliberately be angry with oneself for fun. 'Man will conquer nature,' the cadres in the district say that, and he also says that. Could it be that this thing I have never heard of is really reasonable? The cadres in the district said: Because Anjide's family rescued early and took good care, less than thirty of their thousands of sheep died. Because Habuke's family rescued slowly and did not take good care, only two hundred were left out of eight hundred sheep. Would the cadres lie? Probably not. They can deceive one person, but they can't deceive everyone... Thinking like this, what the child says and does may be reasonable. Maybe I am wrong. Could it really be like the old neighbor Dunburri said; now the young boys, girls, and daughters-in-law are riding in cars to the golden country, and we old women are taking the slow and shaky old ox carts, falling behind?..."

Reality is the most ruthless. In the face of reality, you can be stubborn. Biligen the old woman was like this. The lambs around the stove were the most real to her.

When Daoerji had just brought the lambs home from the snowstormy grassland, death was looming so powerfully, the lambs even had difficulty calling out, only their little bellies were still breathing a little. Among them, there was a lovable little lamb with a red nose that couldn't even stand on its limbs, lying paralyzed on the felt, making what seemed like pre-death convulsions. "This one is probably going to die first." Even Daoerji was worried about it. However, when he wrapped it up in an old sheepskin, held it in his arms, warmed the lamb's body with the warmth of his whole body, placed its tender little lips, and fed it drop by drop with a feeding device, it really gradually turned around. After several days of patient feeding, this lamb gradually managed to stand up with its hind legs, and slowly its front legs could also stand up. In less than three days, like the other lambs, it could already call out sharply, jumping, and wagging its little tail, asking for milk. In Biligen the old woman's heart, thoughts of secretly admitting her mistake surged up like a tide.

An occasional small thing further aggravated Biligen the old woman's mood of secretly admitting her mistake: when she came back from milking the cow outside the yurt with the milk dedicated to Heaven, walking past the lambs, this red-nosed lamb, as if it was the first to smell the milk fragrance on her hand, suddenly shrugged its body and burrowed straight into her crotch. When she bent down to pull it away, it really found something like a nipple--Biligen the old woman's finger, and sucked frantically, waving its tail diligently to express its gratitude. From the lamb's warm little tongue, Biligen the old woman concretely and intimately felt the warmth of the lamb's life.

Biligen the old woman naturally and instinctively reasoned for the child.

      "...It's this little thing, a few days ago, I once determined that it was going to die, and I felt very uncomfortable arguing with the child. The gods sent such a big snowstorm, and they really wanted them to die. But, in a few days, it (they) actually wagged its little tail and begged me for milk. If it weren't for the child taking care of them day and night, like me, praying all the time, then they would have only been asked to make lambskin coats..."

Biligen the old woman's heart, which had been made very nervous by Heaven, really relaxed. It was like a clod of earth thrown into a lake, gradually and silently dissolved by the water of reality.

At night, when Biligen the old woman and Daoerji went together to participate in a small group meeting of the mutual aid team, after listening to the speech of the leader of the mutual aid team, the thought that she was wrong made her feel like an ant on a hot pot. She deeply felt in her heart that if she didn't quickly explain her mistake, it wouldn't work.

After narrating the general situation, the leader of the mutual aid team said with a pointed summary:
      "In the work of rescuing livestock after this heavy snowstorm, it can be said that there are two different attitudes. One is fatalism, believing that this is destined by Heaven; Heaven gave too many livestock after Liberation, and wants to take some back, and will give more next year. One kind of person is resolutely resisting the disaster, and believes that human power can overcome the disaster, and can reduce the death of livestock to the lowest number. There are such living examples in this district: Anjide's family actively strengthened the sheepfold, used various methods to enhance the nutrition of weak sheep, and did a good job of caring for the lambs, and only a few dozen died out of thousands of sheep; Habuke's family waited passively, and two-thirds of the big sheep died. Aren't the sheep of both families grazing on the same grassland? Don't they all run and call? Those who believe in Heaven should think about it..."

In Biligen the old woman's ears, the words of the leader of the mutual aid team all seemed to be talking about herself. These words were like sharp needles, pricking her heart one by one. And the most painful pricks were the following words:

    "What is Heaven? What is God? Everyone can understand this very clearly from the above two examples. God is nothing else, it is our good sheepfolds, more foreign grass, more soybean cakes, better feeding management, better attention to feeding those weak ewes and lambs. God is the good ideas given by our Communist Party and the cadres sent by the People's Government to help us with disaster relief. Who, which old person, even if he is eighty years old, has seen or heard of cadres walking hundreds of miles to our homes, giving us ideas for disaster relief, helping us strengthen the sheepfold, cutting soybean cakes with a knife, feeding the lambs drop by drop... With them, there is nothing to fear from any disaster..."

When the leader of the mutual aid team spoke, Biligen the old woman constantly searched for Daoerji's gaze from the gaps between people, as if praying for the child's understanding and comfort. Her eyes seemed to be repeatedly saying: "Child, I was wrong..." But, coincidentally, Biligen the old woman never found her child's gaze along the place illuminated by the candle. The child was sitting with his back to the stove, close to the yurt wall. The child was feeling very ashamed of his mother's mistake.

The leader of the mutual aid team told everyone:
    "The district received a notice from above saying that there will be heavy snowstorms in the next few days. In addition to continuing to strengthen the sheepfold, our mutual aid team should organize a group of people to rush to the neighboring mutual aid teams whose sheepfolds have not been built too well overnight. Whoever wants to go, please sign up quickly."

Daoerji and the young lads and girls signed up in unison. Then, after a candle shook for a while, everyone crowded out of the yurt door together, and in less than the time it took to pack a bag of tobacco, they rode their horses, shouting and galloping into the grassland, disappearing into the darkness.

At this time, in Biligen the old woman's heart, a burst of shame that she had never experienced in her life attacked her.

    "I was wrong, and I even scolded the child, letting others say this and that about his mother in front of him, making him lose face... I should find a way to make him forgive me..."

"The feeling of fear, like when I accidentally broke my grandfather's beloved green jade pipe when I was a child," (Biligen the old woman later told people when she recalled) could not be suppressed no matter what. She finally stood up strongly from the carpet, pushed open the yurt door, and shouted loudly to the people who had long since disappeared into the darkness:
    "Child, Daoerji... Leader of the mutual aid team... Wait... Wait... I... Have... Something... To... Say..."

A gust of wind挟着隆隆威势刮过来from the willow bushes in the north, scattered her words like sand. Even she herself could not detect the pitch of her own voice.

Biligen the old woman stood blankly on the grassland outside the yurt that had been damaged by cattle, thinking this in her heart, moving her lips like this, but not saying anything out loud:
      "I have believed in Heaven enough... I can't believe it anymore... I should believe in the child..."
            May 11, in Hailar, Inner Mongolia
    [Note] "Bu Wai" is a tune sung by Mongolian women to soothe infants.

    妈妈的醒悟
    ——内蒙古生活纪事
    李翼
    比利根老婆婆笃信天神，就好像是笃信任何一条平凡的生活真理——比如说草爬子吸血吸得针刺一样疼——那样的深刻。在她看来，解放后逐步向上的生活，她和她独一无二的男孩子青年团员道尔基的健康，全是神家——老天爷的保佑啊！
    好多年少见的一场大风雪以后，瘦弱的母羊和小羊死得很多。真正的原因是这样的：去年秋天没有抓好膘水；接羔前又是接连很多天的游动；防避风雪的棚圈打得不好。各家的具体情况虽然不同，原因却只有公认的一条：人尽的力量还不够。
    比利根老婆婆与那些笃信天神的人们一样，认为这是老天爷的意思，是老天爷发了脾气。
    她向人们诉说着这样的话：
      “老天爷知道的最清楚。这几年，咱们呼伦贝尔草原上的牲畜，特别是羊，繁殖得太快了，天要向回要一些……”
    “老天爷，我不敢请您留下太多的牲畜啊。你看着我们的命运留吧。只要能留下够吃肉的羊，够做奶茶的一头乳牛，我们就很知福了……”
    这样，平时还经常参加劳动的比利根老婆婆，对于那些瘦弱的母羊和死了妈妈的小羔子的饲养，就不愿意加以理睬了。她陷入一种任天摆布，期待严重打击的心理中了。平时她那还算直溜的脊背，现在也伛偻起来了。眼睛无神地扫视着周围的一切。她的全身似乎只在一件事情上聚集着力量：向天空里撒牛奶，撒奶茶，眯缝着眼向天祈祷。
    比利根老婆婆的男孩子道尔基，是青年团员，在学校里受过教育，在本区里一向是各项工作中的积极分子，对于风雪灾害的看法，自然与妈妈有所不同了。
    道尔基忧郁的暗想：
    “家里有这样一个落后的妈妈，养育自己的妈妈呀，信天信得连揽羊的事情看也懒得看一眼了，这叫我多丢人！人家，特别是团里的同志们会这样笑话我：‘哈哈！他的母亲是这样子的迷信……’可是，又怎么办呢？”
    道尔基从自己的思想的窄路上渐渐踏上了大路。
      “我总得和她好好说说……我应该用铁的事实让她看看，从心里动摇她听天由命的思想，就好像从根底刨树，树会倒的干脆一样。”
    大风雪后的第四天晚上，当赤紫色的月亮从东方地平线的云网里严肃的升起来时，道尔基从羊圈里接二连三的抱来了十五、六只死了妈妈的小羔子，用破毡片子缚住它们的身腰，围绕着火炉子整整放了一大圈。小羔子们因为体弱又无母奶可吃，交错的发出了一种悲伤的呼唤声。道尔基一个接连一个耐心的用牛角做的喂奶器喂它们。他把小羔子抱在怀里，宛如一个温柔的女性。妈妈呢，依然天呀地呀的在祈祷着，对于小羔子们的叫声，显现着异常的憎嫌，好像是生怕小羔子们的叫声，吓跑了她的就要请下来的神灵一样。
    她终于激动的说出了口：
      “你快把它们弄回羊圈里去吧。这些讨人厌的东西，听这叫声，它们还能活得了吗？天不让它们活，所以才夺走了它们的妈妈。吃奶的生灵，人是喂不活的呀！……别看你把它们放在火炉边上，炉火是顶不了什么事的。该活的，就是放在大风雪里也是要活的。日本人在诺门坎吃败仗的第二年春天一场大风雪里就是这样的：揽在羊圈、包里的大羊、小羔子都死了，随着风雪卷走了的那一些，反倒一个也没有死啊！……”
    人在最紧迫的劳动里是顾不上说话的。道尔基也是这样。开始，他根本没有理睬妈妈的这一套话。在他的脑子里，净是盘算着怎样才能把这一批小羔子抢救过来。“总有跟妈妈说个清楚的时候……喂活了这一批小羔子，比跟她说半天还要强。反正这是要在几天的时间见‘灵验’的事儿。”他暗自为自己的工作高兴起来。可是，偶一不谨慎，对于妈妈那种虔诚的祈祷，竟‘?儿’的一下笑出声来。这可惹起了妈妈的不满。
      “好！你笑我啦，你这坏小子。要知道，笑我也就是笑神哪！神要不依你的。不信你就看着，准有报应……”
    比利根老婆婆有意的扩大着神的权力，瞪着眼，威胁着，活似她就是神的本身。
    话到了喉咙里，不说出去，就痒的发慌。这时候的道尔基就是这样。他忽然涌上了一种想法：
  “我忙着这（抢救羊），妈妈忙着那（祈祷），总得说个清楚。生自己的妈妈应该和自己走一条路。”于是，一场争辩开始了。
   “妈妈，您天天说牲畜死是天意，人没一点办法，我问您，您真的看到过老天爷吗？它是一个什么样儿的东西？”道尔基半笑着向妈妈说。当他刚把这些话说出去以后，心里立刻浮现了童年时代的回忆，他想：“我好像是回到了小孩子的时候。那时候我净向妈妈撒娇，说话不知深浅，有时惹的她生半天气。现在我大了，还向她这样……可是，青年团员的家，青年团员的妈妈应该也是进步的。这些话不说清楚可怎么能行呢。”
    比利根老婆婆沉静了片刻，把嘴努了好几努，显然是为儿子突然说出来的太无礼貌的话感到失措了。可是，当她把眼光缓慢的移向儿子时，凝块般的语句终于吐出来。
    “孩子，你这么说是有罪的啊！难道你看不到天？去年咱们的羊羔子连一个也没有死，不是天意是什么？你吃的穿的都是老天爷给的。你不感谢天，反倒骂天，真是一个坏小子！”
    “妈妈，我再问您一句，”道尔基眨着眼睛，微笑着，显然是有意打趣妈妈。“今年老天爷叫咱们死多少牲畜？”
    比利根老婆婆急切的把话抛给了儿子，好像是反击：
      “天还不能告诉你。要等到六月里才能告诉你。在这以前，如果你不好好供奉着他老人家，说不定咱家的牲畜要死个差不多呢。就像是人们常说的：老年里，牲畜死光了，只能用狗脖子驮着包椽子搬家……”
    道尔基感觉到妈妈说的好笑。暗想：“趁机会揭一揭她老人家的老底子吧。”
    “妈妈，您还说天哩，您说的不是什么天啊。谁不知道，六月里草都长的高高的了，牲畜有了青草吃，就不会死了。您说的天就是这个样子吧！……”
    比利根老婆婆因为儿子的话生气了，激动了起来。
     “你这坏孩子，不是好好对我说，你是诚心想气我的。要知道，气了我，天也是不依你的。别看你在火炉旁边喂着这么多的小羊羔，没有一个是会活的了。不信你就看着，不到三天就会死得一个也不会剩的。天要要回去的，凡人是拦挡不了的……等两天，你还会连牛奶也挤不出多少来了，母牛的奶要干瘪了。天是要叫你向牛也借不到奶汁儿的呀！”
    “好吧，那咱们就看看这一批小羔子能不能成活。您祈祷你的，我喂我的小羔子，真就像您说的，不到三天就会见灵验的。”
    一场不愉快的争论，就此结束了。比利根老婆婆照旧是消极、沉闷、等待，除了吃饭，就是祈祷，就是把着烟管，一袋一袋的吸着，深吸一口，再带着声音吐了出来，眼睛看着烟雾由浓密逐渐消失，由包里逐渐流向天窗口，然后随着风儿飞向不知道的地方去了。道尔基呢，由于同妈妈打了赌，对于小羔子的饲育就更加热心了。白天他除了到羊圈里帮助别人喂瘦弱的母羊，或是到草场上放羊以外，就坐在火炉跟前，一个一个的喂小羔子，缚一缚它们身上的毡片，为小羔子唱着愉快的调子，用满腔的热情看着小羔子逐渐活跃起来的动作，心里想：“也许这就是我的成绩吧，照妈妈的话说，这也许就是神给我的报应了。报应得小羔子都活起来了……”夜晚呢，他改变了多少年来一直挨着妈妈身边睡的习惯，把地毡子拉的离小羔子近近的，手儿抚摸着它们，耳朵单听着它们的叫声，一夜都没有安睡的时候，眼皮肿了，饭也吃的很少，偶尔从挂厨上拿下一两块奶干子，泡点奶茶吃一吃……他真的像是一个柔情的妈妈了。在他心里，童年时代和同伴们作折羊腿骨游戏时，一连用全力打好几下，惟恐打它不断的一种竞争心，就像是春天草原上的小草儿一样，在一层枯黄的草末子下面蠕动了。
    比利根老婆婆因为孩子的几句话，暗自无声的生起气来，就好像是开了锅的牛奶一样，不可抑止的向上泛冒着。
      “他是我的亲生子啊，是我独一无二的孩子啊，又不是抱养的……我从小就把他揽在怀里，尿一把，屎一把的替他洗、刷、缝、连，吃一嘴，喂一嘴，‘布歪’〔注〕声不知道唱过多少万遍。真想不到他竟这样气起我来了……我对他是那样关心，他却气我……”
    比利根老婆婆回忆起从小对孩子的关心来，一种委曲的心情猛涌的袭了上来。这回忆就像是越走越深的深渊，就像是一条没有头儿的带子，缓慢而又痛苦的在她脆弱的心灵里舒展开来。一件新近的事，鲜明的浮了上来。
    是啊！不多几天以前，道尔基和互助组的别个组员，割了一大车盖棚圈的柳条子回来，比利根老婆婆满面笑容的迎着他，给他打了打身上的砂土，温了点水洗了洗脸。道尔基刚在火炉边坐下，比利根老婆婆就悄然无声的给他端来了一大银花碗放有奶干子、奶皮子的奶茶，嘴上挂着笑意，眼巴巴的看着孩子吃着喝着。因为道尔基清脆的嚼着奶干子，比利根老婆婆也感到了一种香意……道尔基刚喝完奶茶，嚼完了最后一块奶干子，比利根老婆婆就从外边弄来一大筐子干牛粪，大把的加在火炉里，洗了洗手，就做起肉面条来。
    “多放还是少放些干肉？”比利根老婆婆祈求似的问。
    “妈妈，你看着放吧。”道尔基轻柔的带着一种感谢的意味回答。
    “春天的肉有点味儿，不如新鲜的肉好吃，还是少……”
      “……”道尔基只用眼睛抚摸了妈妈一下，没有说什么。
    母子之间荡漾着一种幸福的柔情。
    比利根老婆婆在这件事情上凝思良久。她的心像是春天的冰凌一样，渐渐为一种暖意所溶化了。也好像是冒出了锅的但还不曾揭开锅盖子的牛奶一样，把下边的火浇得快要熄灭了。她从母性的本能上逐渐的理解着孩子的行动了。她真的是沿着宽阔的道路迈开思想的步子了。
    “……也许孩子是有些道理的。自己的孩子怎么会故意同自己生气玩呢。‘人定胜天’，区上的干部们这么说，他也这么说。莫非这个我从没有听到过的话，真的是有道理的吗？区上的干部们说：安基得家因为抢救的早，护理的好，上千只羊只死了不到三十只。哈不科家因为抢救的慢，护理的不好，八百只羊只剩下了二百多只。干部们会说谎？大概不会吧。骗了我一个人，可骗不了大伙儿呀……照这样的想，孩子说的做的可就有道理了。也许我是不对的了。莫非真的像邻舍顿布尔日老嫂子说的；如今的年轻小子、姑娘、媳妇们，坐着汽车向金子国里奔，我们这老婆子们坐着又慢又摇晃的老牛车走，落后了？……”
    现实是最冷酷的。在现实面前，不怕你嘴硬。比利根老婆婆就是这样的。火炉周围的小羔子们，对她说来，是最现实不过的了。
    当道尔基刚从刮着暴风雪的草场上，把小羔子们弄回家里来时，死神是那样威武的笼罩着，小羔子们连呼唤的声音也已费力了，只是小肚子还在喘着一点儿气。其中有一只红鼻梁的叫人喜爱的小羔子，四肢连站也站不起来了，瘫在毡片上，作着好像是死前的抽搐。“可能是这个先要死了。”连道尔基也为它耽心。可是，当他用一张老羊皮把它包卷起来，揽在怀里，用他全身的温暖，温暖着小羔子的身子，摆着它那洁嫩的小嘴唇，用喂奶器一点一滴的喂起它来时，它果然逐渐的有了转机了。又经过了几天耐心的喂养，这个小羔子，由后腿能艰难的站起，慢慢的前腿也能站起来了。不到三天的工夫，它和其他的小羔子一样，已是能尖厉的呼叫着，蹦跳着，摇着小尾巴，向人要求着奶汁儿了。在比利根老婆婆的心里，暗自认错的想法，像潮水
  一般的涌了上来。
    偶然的一件小事情，更加重了比利根老婆婆暗自认错的心情：当她在包外从母牛身上挤了献给老天爷的奶汁儿回来，走过小羔子们的身边时，这只红鼻梁的小羔子，好像是第一个闻到了她手上的奶香，突然耸起了身子，向着她的腿裆里直钻。当她伏下身子去拨开它时，它真的找到了像是奶头儿似的东西——比利根老婆婆的手指头，就疯狂的吸吮了起来，尾巴殷勤的摇摆着表示感谢。比利根老婆婆从小羔子热呼呼的小舌头上，具体地、亲切地感觉到了小羔子生命的温暖。
    比利根老婆婆自然而又本能的为孩子圆理了。
      “……就是这小东西呀，几天以前，我曾经断定它是要死的，与孩子争的心里怪难受的。神刮了这么大的风雪，也真的是要让它们死的呀。可是，没有几天，它（们）竟摇着小尾巴向我乞求起奶汁儿来了。如果不是孩子黑夜当白天的这样照顾，像我这样，一个劲儿的祷告，那它们也只能叫人家去做羔子皮袄穿了……”
    比利根老婆婆被老天爷弄得十分紧张的心，真的松弛下来了。就像是抛向湖里的一块土疙瘩，渐渐无声的被现实的水溶化了。
    夜晚，当比利根老婆婆与道尔基一同去参加互助组的一次小组会，听了互助组组长的讲话后，自己错了的想法，使她像热锅上的蚂蚁一样。她心里深深的感觉到，如果不赶快把自己的错误说个清楚不行了。
    互助组长在叙述了一般情况以后，带着总结的口吻若有所指的说：
      “在这次大风雪后抢救牲畜的工作中，可以说有两种不同的态度。一种是听天由命，认为这是天注定的；解放后天给的牲畜太多了，要要回去一些，来年再给。一种人就是坚决的抵抗灾害，而且相信人的力量可以战胜灾害，可以使牲畜的死亡减到最低的数字。本区就有这样活生生的例子：安基得家积极加强棚圈，使用各种方法增强瘦弱羊的营养，做好了小羔子的护理工作，上千只羊里仅有几十只死亡；哈不科家消极等待，只大羊就死了三分之二。难道他两家的羊不都是在一样的草场上放牧吗？不都是会跑会叫的吗？那些信天的人就该想一想……”
    在比利根老婆婆听起来，互助组长的话都好像是说的自己。这些话就像是尖针一样，一针一针的把她的心刺痛了。而刺得最痛的，要算是下边的几句话：
    “什么是天？什么是神？大家从上边两个例子来看，就十分明白了。神不是别的，就是咱们的好棚圈，更多的洋草，更多的豆饼，更好的饲养管理，更好的注意饲养那些瘦弱的母羊和小羔子。神就是咱们共产党和人民政府派来帮助咱们救灾的干部出的好主意。有谁，有那个老人，就算他是八十岁的人吧，看到过或是听到过干部徒步走上百八十里地，来到咱们家里，给咱们出救灾的主意，帮助咱们加强棚圈，一刀子一刀子的切豆饼，一点一滴的喂小羔子……有了他们，什么灾害都不怕……”
    比利根老婆婆在互助组长讲话时，不时从人的隙缝里寻找着道尔基的眼光，似乎是祈求着孩子的谅解，温慰。她的眼睛好像在反复的说：“孩子，是我错了……”可是，也巧，比利根老婆婆始终没有沿着蜡烛照亮的地方，寻找到孩子的眼光。孩子背着火炉坐在紧靠包墙那边哩。孩子在为妈妈的错误感到十分的惭愧。
    互助组长告诉大家说：
    “区上接到上边的通报说，这几天还要有大风雪，咱们互助组除了继续加强棚圈，应该组织一部分人，连夜赶到棚圈还没有打的太好的邻近互助组上去。谁愿意去，谁就快些报名。”
    道尔基与年轻的小伙子、姑娘们，异口同声的报了名。于是，在蜡烛一阵摇晃以后，大家一齐拥出了包门，没有装一袋烟的工夫，就骑上了马，吆喝着驰入草原，消失在黑暗里了。
    这时，比利根老婆婆的心里，袭来了一阵一生从没有过的羞惭。
    “是我错了呀，我还骂了孩子，叫别人在他面前说他妈妈这个那个，叫他丢人……我应该想法让他谅解我……”
    “像是童年时代曾经打坏祖父心爱的绿色玉烟嘴时那样害怕的心情，”（比利根老婆婆后来回忆时对人们说）无论如何也抑止不下去了。她终于坚强的从地毡子上站了起来，推开了包门，向早已消失在黑暗中的人们大声的喊：
    “孩子，道尔基……互助组长……等……等……我……有……话……要……说……”
    从北面柳丛边挟着隆隆的威势刮过来的一阵风，把她的话像砂粒似的吹散了。连她自己也觉察不出自己语调的高低来了。
    比利根老婆婆呆呆的站在包外被牛踏坏了的草地上，心里这样想着，嘴唇这样动着，只是没有说出声：
      “老天爷可信够了……我可不能信了……我该信孩子……”
