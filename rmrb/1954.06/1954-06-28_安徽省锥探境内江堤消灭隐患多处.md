The Anhui District Jiangdi (Yangtze River bank) Repair and Protection Office of the Downstream Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, using the experience of cone penetration of the Yellow River dikes, conducted comprehensive cone penetration on the Jiangdi and discovered 645 hidden dangers. This fact not only powerfully shattered the paralyzing thought among some cadres and masses that "the Jiangdi is foolproof," but also provided reliable data for future Jiangdi repair and protection work.

The hidden dangers discovered by cone penetration on the Anhui Jiangdi generally required over 100 jin of sand to fill, and the largest required 2,200 jin of sewage. In the Tongma Dike of Susong County, a badger den was found, and after excavation, nine badgers of various sizes were caught. In the Guangji Embankment of Huaining County, a hidden danger was discovered, and after excavation, it was found to be interconnected, with the largest place large enough for a person to crawl into. Most of these hidden dangers have been repaired after being discovered; the few that could not be repaired due to rising river water have also had reserve soil selected and flood control equipment prepared, in case of emergency.

After several years of construction since liberation, the Anhui District Jiangdi has changed the appearance of being riddled with holes left by the reactionary government and has basically reached the required standards. However, some projects were constructed hastily and the quality was not high; at the same time, old dangerous spots and hidden dangers have not been completely eliminated. In July 1953, the Anhui District Jiangdi Repair and Protection Office invited two cone penetration technicians from the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, which had achieved good results in learning from the Yellow River cone penetration experience, to help train a group of cone penetration technical cadres. This year, five cone penetration teams were established and conducted universal cone penetration on the Jiangdi of fifteen counties and cities along the river from early March to the end of May.

### 安徽省锥探境内江堤消灭隐患多处

    安徽省锥探境内江堤消灭隐患多处
    长江水利委员会下游工程局安徽区江堤修防处，运用黄河大堤锥探经验，在江堤上全面锥探，共发现隐患六百四十五处。这一事实不仅有力地打破了某些干部群众认为“江堤万无一失”的麻痹思想，也为今后的江堤修防工作提供了可靠的资料。
    在安徽江堤上用锥探发现的隐患，一般的灌沙一百多斤，最大的灌汙二千二百斤。在宿松县同马堤发现一个獾子洞，开挖后捉到大小獾子九只。怀宁县广济圩有个隐患，开挖后发现里面四通八达，最大的地方可钻进一个人。这些隐患在发现后，大部分都进行了翻修；少数因江水上涨不能翻修的，也都已挑好预备土，准备了防汛器材，以备抢险。
    安徽区江堤在解放后经过几年来的兴修，已经改变了反动政府遗留下来百孔千疮的面貌，基本上达到要求的标准。但因有些工程施工草率，质量不高；同时旧有险工隐患还没能完全消灭。一九五三年七月间，安徽区江堤修防处就向学习黄河锥探经验有成绩的江西省水利局请来两位锥探技师，帮助培养了一批锥探技术干部，今年成立了五个锥探队，三月初至五月底，在沿江十五个县、市江堤上普遍进行了锥探。
