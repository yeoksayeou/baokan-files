Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, June 12th:

　　The Huang Fan District in eastern Henan Province has seen a rapid increase in population since liberation, and is now a prosperous region with villages and a dense population. In Xihua and Fugou counties, which suffered the most during the Yellow River floods, there are now 706,943 people, more than ten times the population at the time of liberation in 1947, exceeding the population before the Yellow River floods.

　　The Huang Fan District was originally a rich area in the Central Plains, with a large population and abundant products. In 1938, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang breached the Yellow River dyke, and the turbid Yellow River flooded southward, engulfing the entire plain. Farmland and villages were submerged, and countless people died. In Xihua and Fugou counties alone, 140,000 to 150,000 people were drowned at the time. The survivors were scattered everywhere, almost all over China. Ling Gao Wu, a farmer from Nanling Village in Xihua County, drifted through several provinces and eventually ended up in Hami County, Xinjiang Province. In these wandering and miserable days, countless victims were tortured to death by hunger and disease, or brutally murdered by Kuomintang bandit troops and bandits. In Hudangcheng Village, Xihua County, with less than a thousand people, seven or eight hundred people died for these reasons. After eight or nine years of flooding, when the floodwaters receded, the Huang Fan District became a desolate area full of yellow sand, weeds, and mud, with no sign of human habitation for dozens of miles. In 1947, the counties in the Huang Fan District were liberated one after another, and the victims who had been away from their homes for a long time gradually returned under the call and assistance of the People's Government. The People's Government distributed a large amount of grain, livestock, and farm tools to help them rebuild their homes. Afterwards, large-scale land reclamation, river management, and drainage projects were carried out. By 1949, the flooded land had been turned back into farmland. In the winter of 1950, the great land reform movement was launched in the Huang Fan District, and when the good news spread, the victims who had remained elsewhere brought their old and young back to their hometowns. By this time, the population of the Huang Fan District had basically recovered. Xihua County quickly increased from more than 30,000 people in the early days of liberation to 339,331 people.

　　Since then, under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of the Huang Fan District have launched a lively patriotic production movement. The yield of the land has rapidly increased from 30 to 40 jin per mu per year to more than 300 jin, with the highest reaching more than 700 jin. The places that were originally filled with shacks and straw sheds have gradually become villages with new houses hidden among green willows, and the living conditions of the people in the Huang Fan District have changed. At the same time, the central leading organs and the Henan Provincial People's Government have successively sent a large number of medical personnel to cooperate with the local government to carry out large-scale sanitation work, and to eliminate infectious diseases such as kala-azar, diphtheria, smallpox, measles, and cholera that were prevalent after the Yellow River floods. New methods of midwifery were widely promoted, and maternal and child health care work was carried out, so that the health of the broad masses of the people was guaranteed.

　　In these happy days, the birth rate in the Huang Fan District has increased year by year, and the mortality rate has gradually decreased. In Xihua and Fugou counties alone, 93,721 babies have been born in the three years since the land reform, almost twice the number of children born in the three years before the land reform. The Ling Heini Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanling Village, Xihua County, has a total of 44 households, and has had 39 babies in the past two years, with only three elderly people dying. The Yu Erfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinzhuang Village, Fugou County, has only 24 households, and added seven children last year, with another seven women pregnant, and no deaths in the entire cooperative for more than three years.

    河南省黄泛区人口迅速增加
    【新华社开封十二日电】河南省东部的黄泛区，解放以来人口逐年增加，如今已是村落棋布、人烟稠密的繁荣之乡了。在黄水泛滥期间受灾最重的西华、扶沟两县，现在共有七十万六千九百四十三人，比一九四七年解放时增加了十倍以上，已超过黄河泛滥以前的人口。
    黄泛区原是中原富庶的地区，人口众多，物产丰饶。一九三八年蒋介石匪帮扒开黄河堤，黄水浊浪滔天，滚滚南来，把这块大平原整个吞没，农田、村庄沉于水底，人民死亡无数，仅西华、扶沟两县当时被淹死的就有十四、五万人。侥幸逃出的灾民，到处飘泊，几乎遍于全中国。西华县南凌村农民凌高五即曾飘荡数省，最后流落到新疆省哈密县。在这种辗转飘泊的愁苦日子里，无数灾民被饥寒疾病折磨而死，或惨遭国民党匪军和土匪杀害。西华县有一个不足千人的护当城村，就因为这些原因死了七、八百人。黄泛区经过八、九年的水患，到黄水退后，变成了满布黄沙、荒草和泥淖数十里不见人烟的荒凉地带。一九四七年，黄泛区各县先后解放，久别家乡的灾民，在人民政府的号召和援助下陆续归来。人民政府发放了大批粮食、牲口和农具，帮助他们重建家园。而后，又进行了大规模的开荒、治河、修筑排水工程，到一九四九年，被水淹没的土地重新变成农田。一九五零年冬季，伟大的土地改革运动在黄泛区轰轰烈烈地展开，喜讯传出，留在外地的灾民都扶老携幼赶回故乡，至此，黄泛区的人口基本恢复。西华县由解放初期的三万多人很快增加到三十三万九千三百三十一人。
    此后，黄泛区人民在人民政府领导下，展开了热火朝天的爱国丰产运动，土地的产量迅速由每亩每年收获三、四十斤提高到三百多斤，最高的达到七百多斤。原来杂列着窝铺、草棚的地方，逐渐变成了绿柳掩映新屋幢幢的村庄，黄泛区人民的生活面貌改变了。和此同时，中央领导机关和河南省人民政府又先后派来大批医务人员，协同当地政府开展了大规模的卫生工作，把黄河泛滥以后流行的黑热病、白喉、天花、麻疹、霍乱等传染病扑灭，并广泛推行了新法接生，开展妇婴保健工作，使广大人民的身体健康得到保障。
    在这幸福的日子里，黄泛区的婴儿出生率逐年提高，人口死亡率逐渐降低，仅西华、扶沟两县从土地改革后至今三年内出生的婴儿就有九万三千七百二十一人，几乎等于土地改革前三年出生儿童的两倍。西华县南凌村凌黑妮农业生产合作社共有四十四户，近两年来就生了三十九个婴儿，死亡的只有三个老年人。扶沟县新庄村郁二斧农业生产合作社只有二十四户，去年一年就添了七个孩子，另有七个妇女怀了孕，而三年多来全社无一死亡。
