Xinhua News Agency Report:

The people of Yan'an, the sacred site of the revolution, regard the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China as a major event that can never be forgotten. On the afternoon of the 15th, when the news of the publication of the Draft Constitution was broadcast by the Yan'an Broadcasting Station, more than 5,000 cadres, students, soldiers, and residents from various organizations in Yan'an gathered around more than a dozen loudspeakers, listening attentively. The representatives of the Yan'an County Cooperative Union, who were in a meeting, became even more enthusiastic after hearing the good news of the publication of the Draft Constitution. Everyone expressed their determination to vigorously promote and organize farmers to develop supply and marketing cooperatives on a voluntary basis, in accordance with the spirit of the Draft Constitution. Yang Buhao, a famous agricultural labor model in Yan'an, said excitedly: "The people of Yan'an, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao, overcame numerous difficulties and supported the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. The publication of the Draft Constitution is the result of our many years of struggle, and it will become a powerful guarantee for us to realize a socialist society. We must do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, and strive to build a prosperous and strong socialist society." Liang Zhihong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Yan'an County People's Congress and a model worker and soldier, believes that the publication of the Draft Constitution is "the happiest event in his life that he will never forget."

Xinhua News Agency Report: The people of Western Fujian, a famous old revolutionary base area in our country, are welcoming the publication of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" with joy and excitement. Several comrades who had persisted in the struggle for a long time expressed their feelings about the publication of the Draft Constitution.

Chen Jinsheng, who participated in the armed uprising in Houtian Village, Longyan County in 1928 and is now the director of the Houtian Village Farmers' Association, said: "This Draft Constitution was exchanged for the blood and heads of countless martyrs. In our Houtian Village alone, more than 60 people sacrificed in the revolutionary struggle against the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now the rights we have fought for have been registered in the Draft Constitution, and we must cherish and protect them." Qiu Maurong, a farmer from Xietou Village, Longyan County, is one of the oldest rural Communist Party members in Western Fujian. He is 63 years old and participated in revolutionary activities in 1926. He said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates that we must 'eliminate exploitation and poverty and build a prosperous and happy socialist society.' We warmly support this. This is the wish of the people in our old base area for many years. We have struggled for it for more than 20 years, and we must continue to work hard to achieve a socialist society as soon as possible." Zhang Sangu, a famous "revolutionary old mother" from Houtian Village, Longyan County, is 73 years old. Before liberation, she worked as a "contact person" (liaison officer) for more than ten years, was imprisoned twice, and suffered six tortures, but never revealed any secrets of the Party. She said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates many basic rights of citizens. Before liberation, poor people only suffered from hunger and beatings. Where were any rights? How happy it is to be a Chinese person now! It will be even happier in the future. When I was arrested and tortured by the enemy, I was determined to die to repay the Party. Now I want to live a few more years and do more for the people. I hope to live to be a hundred years old and see the realization of socialism and communism."

[Jiangxi Daily Dispatch] The people of Shazhouba, Ruijin County, where the Chinese Soviet Worker-Peasant Democratic Government was located during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, warmly support the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The Shazhouba Agricultural Production Cooperative held a discussion meeting on the Draft Constitution on the evening of June 19. Yang Yanqiu, a former Red Army soldier and member of the production cooperative, said: "If it were not for Chairman Mao leading us in the struggle for decades, there would be no Draft Constitution of the people!" Yang Chafu, the director of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have stood up and gained democratic rights. The Draft Constitution is the result of a long struggle." The farmers of Shazhouba used many specific examples to expose the false democracy during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Yang Rongfen, a member of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "Before liberation, the landlord Yang Fulin used more than 1,000 dan of grain to buy a seat as a fake senator. Was that for the people? During the election of fake National Assembly representatives, the landlord Liu Jianchang sent his lackeys to force us to vote for him, saying, 'If you don't vote, you'll suffer.'" Through this exposure, everyone further recognized the preciousness of the people being the masters of their own affairs today. Farmer Yang Haifa said: "Today, the power of the country is in the hands of the people. The people have the right to elect the people they are satisfied with as representatives, and they also have the right to remove those who are incompetent and do not work for the people." The publication of the Draft Constitution has inspired the members of the agricultural production cooperative. They expressed their determination to celebrate the publication of the Draft Constitution with practical actions to run the agricultural production cooperative well. Now, the members are carrying out summer harvest preparations, repairing water conservancy projects, and accumulating fertilizer for late rice, striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

    延安、闽西、瑞金革命老根据地人民
    热烈欢迎宪法草案的公布并发表感想
    据新华社讯：革命圣地——延安的人民把中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，看成是一件永远不能忘记的大喜事。十五日下午，当宪法草案公布的消息由延安广播站播出后，延安各机关干部、学生、军队和居民五千多人，聚集在十多个扩音器下全神贯注地听着。正在开会的延安县合作社联合社社员代表会的代表们，听到宪法草案公布的喜讯后，会议进行得更加热烈。大家表示要根据宪法草案的精神，大力宣传和组织农民在自愿的基础上发展供销合作。延安著名农业劳动模范杨步浩兴奋地说：我们延安人民曾在毛主席直接领导下，克服了重重困难，支援了抗日战争和解放战争。宪法草案的公布，是我们多年斗争的成果，它将成为我们实现社会主义社会的有力保证，我们一定要搞好互助合作，为建设繁荣富强的社会主义社会而奋斗。延安县人民代表大会常务委员会副主席、工属模范梁志鸿认为：宪法草案的公布，是他“一生最不能忘记的一件大喜事”。
    据新华社讯：我国著名的革命老根据地闽西地区的人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接“中华人民共和国宪法草案”的公布。几位曾经长期坚持斗争的同志，都发表了自己对于公布宪法草案的感想。
    曾参加过一九二八年龙岩县后田村武装起义、现在担任后田村农民协会主任的陈金盛说：“这个宪法草案是无数烈士用鲜血和头颅换来的，单是我们后田村，在反对地主和国民党反动派的革命斗争中就牺牲了六十多人。现在我们争取到的权利已在宪法草案中登记上了，我们一定要好好地保住它。”闽西地区最老的农村共产党员之一、龙岩县斜头村农民丘茂荣，今年六十三岁，在一九二六年就参加革命活动。他说：“宪法草案中规定要‘消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会’，我们热烈拥护，这是我们老根据地人民多少年来的愿望，我们为了它已斗争了二十多年，我们要继续努力，争取社会主义社会早日到来。”现年七十三岁的龙岩县后田村著名的“革命老妈妈”张三姑，她在解放前曾做过十多年“接头户”（联络员），坐过两次牢，挨过六次拷打，但始终没有泄露过半点党的秘密。她说：“宪法草案里规定了许多公民的基本权利，在解放前，穷人只有挨饿挨打，那里有什么权利，现在做个中国人多么幸福呀！将来会更加幸福。当年我被敌人抓去拷打逼供的时候，我是决心一死来报答党，现在我想多活几年为人民多做些事情，我希望活到一百岁，看到社会主义、共产主义实现。”
      【江西日报专电】第二次国内革命战争时期、中华苏维埃工农民主政权所在地——瑞金县沙洲坝的人民热烈拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。沙洲坝农业生产合作社，在六月十九日晚上举行了宪法草案讨论会。当年的红军战士、生产合作社社员杨衍球说：“要不是毛主席领导我们斗争了几十年，那里有人民自己的宪法草案呀！”农业生产合作社社长杨茶富说：“我们在共产党的领导下，翻了身，有了民主权利。宪法草案就是经过了长期的斗争得来的。”沙洲坝的农民们用很多具体事例，揭露国民党反动派统治时期的假民主。农业生产合作社社员杨荣芬说：“解放前，地主杨傅霖用一千多担谷子，买了一个伪参议长当，那里是为了人民？伪国大代表竞选的时候，地主刘建昌派他的狗腿子强迫我们选他，并说‘不选不行，你们当心吃亏’。”通过这种揭露，大家进一步认识到今天人民当家作主的可贵。农民杨海发说：“今天国家的权力掌握在人民手里，人民有权选自己满意的人当代表，也有权罢免不称职的、不为人民办事的人。”宪法草案的公布，鼓舞了农业生产合作社社员们。他们表示要用办好农业生产合作社的实际行动来庆祝宪法草案的公布。现在，社员们正在进行夏收准备工作，修补水利工程，积晚稻的肥料，争取全年丰收。
