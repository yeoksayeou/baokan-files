Xinhua News Agency, June 29th: After conducting activities in Japan and South Korea to carry out aggressive deployments in the Far East, Van Fleet, the former commander of the US Eighth Army in Korea, who was assigned this mission, led a group of military experts to Taiwan from Tokyo for the third time on the 27th. According to Western news agencies, after arriving in Taiwan, Van Fleet will investigate the training and equipment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops and inspect several islands occupied by them. He will also study a plan to expand the Chiang Kai-shek ground forces and a draft of a US-Chiang bilateral treaty. After his activities in Taiwan, he will go to Manila. US Secretary of Defense Wilson recently revealed at a press conference that Van Fleet's mission to the Far East is to draft a plan to expand the puppet armies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

    While in South Korea, Van Fleet held intense meetings with Syngman Rhee. According to Reuters, Syngman Rhee demanded that the United States greatly expand the Rhee puppet army's ground forces, provide jet fighters and larger naval vessels, including 10,000-ton cruisers, and provide $300 million in annual military "aid." Syngman Rhee also demanded that every Allied division withdrawn from South Korea be replaced by three expanded South Korean divisions, and he stated that he was ready to send two divisions to serve the United States in expanding its war of aggression in Asia. According to the Associated Press, Van Fleet presented Syngman Rhee with a plan for the United States to help South Korea strengthen its military forces. At the same time, US President Eisenhower also wrote to Syngman Rhee, "discussing the potential of using American money and equipment to strengthen the South Korean army," and "assured" him that the United States would "continue to support" his arrogant demand to establish a fascist dictatorship in all of Korea. This action by the US authorities to encourage Syngman Rhee is clearly an attempt to deepen the instability and division of Korea in order to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, maintain tension in the Far East, and use Syngman Rhee to carry out new activities to disrupt peace in the Far East.

    During his stay in Tokyo, Van Fleet held a series of meetings with senior Japanese officials and owners of arms companies. According to Western news agencies, these meetings discussed the issue of Japan further expanding its puppet army and participating in the US-organized military aggression group in Asia. They also studied a plan to expand Japan's arms production "to make Japan the arsenal of the Far East." According to the provisions of this plan, the Japanese arms industry will resume large-scale production with the "assistance" of US capital, producing large quantities of weapons and ammunition for the United States to expand its puppet armies and carry out aggressive actions in Asia.

### 范佛里特在远东进行活动  图谋扩充在亚洲的傀儡军队

    范佛里特在远东进行活动
    图谋扩充在亚洲的傀儡军队
   【新华社二十九日讯】奉命到远东来进行侵略部署的前侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特在日本和南朝鲜进行活动后，已在二十七日从东京第三次率领一批军事专家到达台湾。据西方通讯社报道，范佛里特到达台湾后，将调查蒋匪军的训练和装备情况，并视察蒋匪军盘踞的若干岛屿；他还将研究一个扩充蒋匪地面部队的计划和一项美蒋双边条约草案。他在台湾活动后将再去马尼拉。美国国防部部长威尔逊最近在记者招待会上透露，范佛里特到远东来的任务是拟订一项扩充日本、南朝鲜、台湾和菲律宾傀儡军队的计划。
    范佛里特在南朝鲜时，与李承晚进行了紧张的会议，据路透社报道，李承晚要求美国大力扩充李伪军地面部队；给予喷气式战斗机和更大的海军舰只，包括一万吨级的巡洋舰；给予每年三亿美元的军事“援助”。李承晚还要求在撤退在南朝鲜的任何一个联军师时都应以扩充三个南朝鲜师来代替，他并表示他随时准备派遣两个师为美国扩大亚洲的侵略战争卖命。据美联社报道，范佛里特向李承晚提出了一个由美国帮助南朝鲜加强军事力量的计划。同时，美国总统艾森豪威尔还写信给李承晚，与他“讨论利用美国的金钱和装备加强韩国军队的潜力的问题”，并且向他“保证”美国将“继续支持”他在全朝鲜建立法西斯独裁统治的狂妄要求。美国当局的这种鼓励李承晚的行动，显然是企图加深朝鲜不稳定和分裂的状态，以阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，保持远东的紧张局势，并利用李承晚来进行新的破坏远东和平的活动。
    范佛里特在东京期间，与日本高级官员和军火企业的老板举行了一系列的会议。据西方通讯社报道，这些会议讨论了日本进一步扩充傀儡军队和参加美国在亚洲组织的军事侵略集团的问题，并研究了扩大日本军火生产，“使日本成为远东兵工厂”的计划。根据这项计划的规定，日本军火工业将在美国资本的“援助”下恢复大规模的生产，为美国在亚洲扩充傀儡军队和进行侵略行动生产大量的武器和军火。
