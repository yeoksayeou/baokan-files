    Thoughts Inspired by the Draft Constitution
    National Model Worker of Industry Liu Qingxiang
    I am reading the draft Constitution with a joyful and solemn feeling. I don't know why, but my heart is pounding nervously.
    I can't help but think about the past and present life. I lived in the old China for seventeen years, and I had enough of the dark life that was worse than that of an animal. I tasted the pain of unemployment, endured hunger, suffered the trampling of the Kuomintang "masters," and endured the beatings and scolding of the military police. At that time, we workers worked eighteen or nineteen hours a day and were still beaten and scolded by the factory owners. What could we do? We had to bury this hatred in our hearts. No one spoke for the workers. The power of the state was in the hands of the enemy, and they held the knife!
    After liberation, the world changed completely. The country thought of the people in everything and planned for the people in everything. The life of hunger and cold is gone forever. I created the surface grinder and, after being elected as a national model worker of industry, I met our great leader Chairman Mao. He warmly congratulated us, shook hands with us, talked to us, and guided our work. An ordinary worker can have so many opportunities to dine at the same table with the leader of his country, shake hands, and talk. How glorious is that!
    On May 6, 1952, I also participated in the World Federation of Trade Unions conference held in Beijing as a representative of China's machine manufacturing industry. This gave me a very profound education. In September 1952, I also joined many worker representatives from all over the country in the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to慰问 the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers on behalf of the Chinese working class. This is also something I will never forget.
    Under the cultivation of the Party and the government, and with the help of the broad masses of workers, my work level has also improved. Therefore, I went from being an ordinary worker to being a team leader, then a vice chairman of the trade union, and in 1952, I became a deputy factory director. In the future, I am determined to do my current work with the greatest effort and maintain and develop the glory of the working class.

    从宪法草案想起的
    全国工业劳动模范  刘庆祥
    我以喜悦而严肃的心情读着宪法草案，不知怎的，我的心紧张地跳动着。
    我不由得想起过去的和现在的生活。我在旧中国生活了十七年，过够了牛马不如的黑暗生活。我尝过失业的痛苦，忍受过饥饿，受过国民党“老爷”们的蹂躏，挨过宪兵的打骂。那时候，我们工人一天干十八、九个钟头的活，还被厂主们打来骂去。有什么办法呢？我们只好把这种仇恨埋在肚子里，工人是没有人给作主的，国家权力被敌人掌握着，刀把子在人家手里！
    解放后，世道根本改变了，国家处处为人民着想，处处为人民打算。饥寒交迫的生活一去不复返了。我创造了对板精磨机，当选为全国工业劳动模范以后，会见了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。他亲切地向我们祝贺，和我们握手，谈话，指导工作。一个普通工人居然能有这样多的机会和自己国家的领袖同桌共餐，握手谈话，该是多么光荣啊！
    一九五二年五月六日，我也以中国机器制造业代表的资格参加了在北京召开的世界工联代表会议。这给了我极为深刻的教育。在一九五二年九月，我还和全国许多工人代表一起参加了中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团，代表中国工人阶级到朝鲜慰问朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，这也是使我永远不能忘记的。
    在党和政府的培养下，在广大工人群众的帮助下，我的工作水平也提高了，因此，我从一个普通工人当上了组长，又当上工会副主席，在一九五二年又当了副厂长。今后我决心以最大的努力，做好现有的工作，保持并发扬工人阶级的光荣。
