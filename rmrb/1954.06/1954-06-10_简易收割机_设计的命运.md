    The Fate of the "Simplified Harvester" Design
    Xiao Ying
    In October of 1952, a young student named Song Jiong took his design drawings for a "simplified harvester," filled with hope, to the agricultural implements department of the Ministry of Agriculture, requesting assistance with trial production. The comrade who received him at the agricultural implements department looked at the drawings and said that there were already many good harvesters available… implying that there was no need to bother creating and testing new machines.

    Song Jiong's enthusiasm for design did not dissipate as a result. He continued to study his design drawings and contacted engineer Wang Guren of the State Farm Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture. Engineer Wang replied, "Your sketch and description of the simplified harvester have been carefully reviewed by me and the comrades in the mechanical engineering department, and we have exchanged opinions. We believe that there are basically no errors in the design principle and that it can be experimentally manufactured." Therefore, the designer once again requested assistance from the agricultural implements department. At that time, the head of the agricultural implements department promised that they could help with trial production and provide a subsidy of "around 100,000 yuan."

    However, after a long time, the agricultural implements department of the Ministry of Agriculture was changed to the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery. The bureau assigned this work to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Bureau. The comrades of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau felt that it would be very difficult to trial-produce this kind of machinery, as they had no technical personnel, no trial production funds, and no factory. Therefore, they introduced him to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for handling.

    In this back-and-forth, more than a year had passed. The designer received a reply from the General Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on May 6th of this year, stating: "...We believe that the trial assembly (manufacture) of harvesters is still difficult to apply universally in rural areas, and the academy does not intend to subsidize it. We have contacted the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and they can assist you in conducting experiments at the factory during the summer vacation..." This reply was both laughable and absurd: since it has not been trial-produced, how can one talk about "universal application in rural areas"? If it is a unusable thing, why introduce it to a factory for experimentation?

    Later, the chief engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory gave him a reply: agreeing that he could conduct experiments, as long as he went through the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery of the Ministry of Agriculture, he could borrow their Soviet-style turning harvester and start experimenting.

    So, the matter that had gone out from the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery had gone around in a circle and returned to the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery.

    In the year and seven months, this young designer took his "simplified harvester" sketches and ran to many organizations, persuading everyone who received him to give him assistance. At the same time, he wrote many letters to those he believed could help him. Unfortunately, besides receiving phrases such as "the design principle is basically correct, it can be trial-produced," he did not receive any real concrete assistance. Although he had also received a letter from the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery on April 30, 1953, expressing concern, asking him "whether the harvester you designed has been successfully trial-produced? Can the wheat harvest be used for testing? What difficulties have you encountered in the trial production?" However, now that the second wheat harvest is approaching, there is still no opportunity for trial production, and the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery has not continued to inquire.

    "Care about the inventions and creations of the masses!" This young designer is earnestly appealing. What will be the fate of this simplified harvester? Now it depends on the attitude of the General Administration of Agricultural Machinery and other relevant organizations!

    “简易收割机”设计的命运
    萧颖
    在一九五二年的十月，青年学生宋炯拿了自己设计的“简易收割机”图样，怀着满腔的希望到农业部农具处去请求帮助试制。农具处接待他的同志看了看图样，说现有的好的收割机很多……，意思是用不着麻烦地去创造试验什么新的机器了。
    宋炯的设计热情并不因此而消散，他一面继续研究自己所设计的图样，一面又和农业部国营农场管理局王顾人工程师联系，王工程师的回信说：“你设计的简易收割机草图及说明，我和机务处的同志已仔细看过，并交换过意见，认为这种设计原理基本上没有什么错误，可以实验制造。”于是设计人再次地向农具处要求帮助，当时农具处处长答应：可以帮助试制，补助“十万块钱”左右。
    但是，过了很久，农业部农具处已改为农业机械管理总局。该局把这一工作批交北京市人民政府农林局去办理。农林局的同志感到试制这种机械，困难很大，既无技术人员，又无试制经费和工厂，于是就介绍他到中国科学院处理。
    这样一来一去时间已经过了一年多了。设计者接到中国科学院办公厅今年五月六日给他的复函说：“……收割机的试装（制）工作我们认为尚难在农村普遍应用，本院不拟补助。我们曾与华北农业机械总厂联系过，暑假可以协助你在该厂进行实验……。”这个答复令人啼笑皆非：既然还没有经过试制，怎能谈得上“在农村普遍应用”？既是一个不能用的东西，又为什么介绍到工厂实验？
    以后，华北农业机械总厂总工程师给了他一个答复：同意他进行试验，只要他通过农业部农业机械管理总局，可以将他们那里的苏式翻收割机借去，着手试验。
    原来从农业机械管理总局出去的事，就这样转了一个圈，又回到农业机械管理总局了。
    一年零七个月的时间内，这位青年设计者带着他的“简易收割机”草图，跑了很多机关，说服每一个接待他的人给他帮助，同时，又写了很多信，给他认为能够帮助他的人；不幸，他除了得到“设计原理基本正确，可以试制”等话句以外，却没有得到任何真正的具体帮助。他虽然也曾经收到农业机械管理总局一九五三年四月三十日给他的一封表示关切的信，询问他“所设计的收割机，不知是否已试制成功？麦收能否进行试验？试制中有何困难？”但是，现在第二个麦收即将来临了，试制的机会还是没有，而农业机械管理总局也并没继续过问。
      “关心群众的发明创造吧！”这位青年设计者在恳挚地呼吁着。这个简易收割机的命运究竟如何？现在要看农业机械管理总局等有关机关对它的态度了！
