    Central Institute of Foreign Trade to be Established Soon
    The Central Institute of Foreign Trade will be formally established this summer.
    The Central Institute of Foreign Trade is formed by merging the former Beijing Institute of Foreign Trade and the Foreign Trade specialty of the Department of Trade of Renmin University of China. Its task is to cultivate high-level specialized personnel in foreign trade for the country. Currently, it has four departments and nine specialties, including Foreign Trade Economics, Russian, Western Languages, and Oriental Languages. The teaching plan stipulates that students majoring in Foreign Trade Economics will have two internships in "Foreign Trade Organization and Technology" and "World Market Conditions." In addition, relevant departments will be invited to regularly report to students on the state of the motherland's industrial and agricultural production and foreign trade work. The school's library has prepared a certain amount of books and materials for the students, including economic historical materials since the imperialist invasion of China, as well as practical materials related to foreign trade and customs. In order to educate students to understand the actual situation of exports, the school has also specially set up a commodity exhibition room, which displays many Chinese export specialties that have been exhibited abroad.

    中央对外贸易学院即将成立
    中央对外贸易学院将在今年暑假正式成立。
    中央对外贸易学院由原北京对外贸易专科学校和中国人民大学贸易系对外贸易专业合并组成，它的任务是为国家培养高级对外贸易专门人材。现在共设置有对外贸易经济、俄语、西方语、东方语等四个系、九个专业。教学计划中规定对外贸易经济专业的学生将有“对外贸易组织与技术”和“世界市场行情”两次的实习，此外并将请有关部门经常向学生报告祖国工农业生产状况和对外贸易工作情况。这个学校的图书馆为学生们准备了一定数量的图书资料，其中包括自帝国主义侵略我国以来的经济史料，以及有关对外贸易和海关的实际资料。为教育学生了解出口的实际状况，学校还专门设置了一个商品陈列室，里面陈列了许多曾经出国展览过的中国出口的土特产品。（新华社）
