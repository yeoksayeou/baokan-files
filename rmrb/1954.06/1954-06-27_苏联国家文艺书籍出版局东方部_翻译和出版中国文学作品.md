    The Soviet National Literary Book Publishing Bureau has an Oriental Department, which organizes the translation, publication, and distribution of Eastern, primarily Chinese, literary works.
    In recent years, several collections of Lu Xun's works have been published: "Lu Xun's Collection of Short Stories and Essays," "Selected Works of Lu Xun," and "Lu Xun's Collection of Novels." A total of approximately 200,000 copies have been distributed. Currently, the first and second volumes of the four-volume "Selected Works of Lu Xun," compiled by the National Literary Book Publishing Bureau, are being published. The third and fourth volumes will be published in 1955. "Selected Works of Guo Moruo" has been distributed in 90,000 copies. "A Collection of Short Stories by Chinese Writers" has been distributed in 30,000 copies, and other collections of short stories have also been distributed in large quantities.
    Soviet readers are very familiar with Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, and others.
    Thanks to the efforts of Soviet translators, the Soviet people are able to read the works of Zhang Tianyi, Liu Baiyu, Zhao Shuli, Wei Wei, and other writers.
    The translation of the historical novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has been underway for several years, translated by the young expert Vladimir Panasyuk. The first volume of the book, edited by Professor V.S. Kolokolov, is beautifully printed and decorated with Chinese woodcuts.
    The famous collection of short stories "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," translated by Academician V.M. Alekseyev and with a postscript by Doctor of Linguistics Fedelin, has been published.
    The Oriental Department has now prepared for printing collections of novels by Lao She and Mao Dun, a collection of poems by the great poet Qu Yuan, and the first volume of the long novel "Water Margin." In addition to these books, the second volume of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," the first and second volumes of "Water Margin," and a large volume of selected works by Mao Dun will also be published this year. A total of thirteen Chinese literary works will be published, with hundreds of thousands of copies being distributed.
    In 1955, it is estimated that approximately one million copies of translated Chinese literary works will be published.
    "Selected Works of Lao She," "Selected Works of Guo Moruo," "Collection of Novels by Chinese Writers," "Collection of Novels by Ye Shengtao," "Collection of Novels by Ba Jin," "Collection of Novels by Zhang Tianyi," "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," and "Selected Works of Sima Qian" will all be printed as single volumes of 500 to 600 pages. "Selected Tang Poems" is nearing completion, and a collection of poems by Du Fu will also be published.
    The work of the Oriental Department has just begun, and the scale of this work will be further expanded in the future.
