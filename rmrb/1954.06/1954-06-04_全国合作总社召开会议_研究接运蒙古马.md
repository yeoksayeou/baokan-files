The All-China Federation of Cooperatives will soon begin receiving 10,000 draught horses imported from the Mongolian People's Republic. In mid-May, the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Inner Mongolia Federation of Cooperatives held a meeting in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to study the methods and steps for receiving and managing Mongolian horses. Representatives from relevant cooperative federations in Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, Liaodong, Rehe, Songjiang, Hebei, Changchun, Harbin, and Shenyang attended the meeting. Representatives from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and other relevant units attended and introduced their experience in raising and managing horses.

The meeting decided that relevant cooperative federations should establish Mongolian horse management organizations to carry out receiving and management work under the joint leadership of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Inner Mongolia Federation of Cooperatives. Before June 10, cooperative federations in relevant provinces and cities should hold a Mongolian horse management meeting to study issues such as setting up mechanized farming, determining transportation routes, establishing horse farms, preparing tools, and distribution and sales. In management, in addition to county cooperative federations and grassroots cooperatives organizing farmers to select and purchase horses at the horse farms, pre-sales can also be carried out. The meeting especially requested that attention be paid to ensuring the health and safety of people and horses during transportation and management.
