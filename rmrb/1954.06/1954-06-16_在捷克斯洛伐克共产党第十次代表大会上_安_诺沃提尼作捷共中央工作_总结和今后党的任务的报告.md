At the 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia
A. Novotny Reports on the Work Summary of the CPC Central Committee and the Party's Tasks for the Future

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, A. Novotny, delivered a report on the work summary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the party's tasks for the future at the 11th session of the 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on the 11th.

In his report, Novotny said that the past five years have been an extremely important period in the life of our party and the whole country, as well as in the development of international relations.

During this period, thanks to the Soviet Union's liberation of our country and the liberation struggle of our people led by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, our people's democratic system was born, and this system was further strengthened and victoriously developed forward.

The Ninth Party Congress held four years after our liberation (held in May 1949) put forward the general line of building socialism in our country. During this period, the regime was completely in the hands of the united working class, which formed a solid alliance with the working peasants, and took the lead in the revitalized National Front, which resolutely smashed the bourgeoisie's open attempt to restore capitalism through a counter-revolutionary coup in the memorable month of February 1948.

Before the Ninth Party Congress, we had successfully completed the period of industrial recovery, and strong and continuously strengthening socialist economic components had appeared in our economy. In the countryside, with the support of the working class, the laboring peasants changed their attitude towards collective agricultural management and socialist large-scale production through a brutal struggle with the last and most brutal exploiting class—the rich peasant class. This is the main characteristic of the domestic situation.

Our international political situation is also conducive to the further development of our people's democratic system, because we are closely linked with our liberator, best friend, and strong pillar of our freedom, independence, and peaceful construction—the great Soviet Union, and because we are a solid component of the powerful democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Today, we can proudly say that the 10th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is being held in the situation of great and victorious progress in our socialist construction. In the period mentioned in the summary report, we have grown and strengthened in the spirit of the resolutions of the Ninth Congress, and we cherish the unity, strengthening, and combat effectiveness of our party as we cherish the apple of our eye. The increasingly arduous tasks of socialist construction and the struggle to complete the tasks of socialist construction have strengthened and tempered the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia—the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of our people. The vicious gang of Slansky was exposed and eliminated, thus smashing the extensive conspiracy against the Czechoslovak Republic and its people, which attempted to overthrow the people's democratic system and restore the old capitalist system in our country.

We incapacitated this gang, we cut off the head of the imperialists' dangerous fifth column, and thus, the party once again showed its unwavering loyalty to the working class, the people, and socialism.

When talking about international trade, the international situation, and Czechoslovakia's foreign policy, Novotny pointed out that the characteristic of the international situation in the period after the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is the continuous growth of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Novotny talked in detail about the achievements made by the countries of the peace camp. He said that during the period of the summary report, the internal solidarity of the democratic camp was further consolidated. The economic and cultural cooperation between the countries in this camp developed and strengthened. The leading force of this camp—the Soviet Union—has taken an important step towards the lofty goal of communism during this period.

Novotny said that the notorious "strength" policy pursued by American imperialists has suffered a complete failure. People of all countries have condemned this policy. They demand a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction and the establishment of a collective security system.

Novotny said that recently, we have witnessed extremely important events that could lead to the elimination of the two sources of war in Asia. We are referring to the Geneva Conference proposed by the Soviet Union, which is currently underway. The broad international public welcomes the convening of this conference. From the beginning of the conference, two proposals for solving international problems have emerged. One proposal is to maintain colonial rule over Asian countries at all costs, even though historical changes have taken place in this region. This is the policy represented by the group of American reactionary militarists. The second proposal is that people of all countries who want to build their own lives in peaceful conditions should have independent rights and the right to decide their own destiny. This is the policy of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist democratic camp.

The primary task of the foreign policy of our party and government is to implement the policy of fighting to defend world peace and ensure the peaceful socialist construction of our country.

This policy is in line with the vital interests of our people, who are wholeheartedly striving for peace. Therefore, our party and government now and in the future fully support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

We must always follow Comrade Gottwald's teachings, who taught us that "to build socialism, safeguard our national freedom and national independence, and maintain peace—all this is unimaginable without forming a solid alliance with the powerful Soviet Union."

We will continue to strengthen the alliance and fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union, and we will care for the mutual development of the economic and cultural ties between our two countries, which can greatly promote our country's prosperity.

Novotny then talked about the increasingly strengthened ties of friendship between the Czechoslovak people and the great Chinese people and the people of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Korea, and Mongolia. He said that we will tirelessly strengthen the mutual ties with the countries that stand with us on the impregnable front of defending peace.

Novotny said that most of our country's borders are currently borders of peace, friendship, and mutual respect. The development of our mutual relations with the German Democratic Republic is a historically significant fact. Since all the factors that oppress the German people have been permanently eliminated in the German Democratic Republic, and militarism and fascism have been permanently eliminated, a new era of mutual relations, namely the era of friendly cooperation, has arrived, and it will continue to develop.

Currently, Czechoslovakia maintains diplomatic relations with sixty-two countries. Our people warmly support the Soviet Union's proposal to ensure solid security in Europe and the world. We are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries, regardless of their systems and political systems, and we will do everything we can together with the true defenders of peace and international security to ensure the realization of the European Collective Security Treaty. We must continue to resist all attempts to restore German militarism in West Germany. We must strive against the planning of a new German-Austrian merger, and we must fully support the forces fighting for a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. We must fully support the struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of the production and use of weapons of mass destruction.

Novotny then talked about the domestic situation in Czechoslovakia. He said: The achievements made in socialist construction clearly demonstrate the great vitality of our people's democratic system, its indestructible solidity, and its ever-growing strength. The creativity and energy of the working people who have been liberated from the ugly rule of capitalism are endless. The face of our country is changing, and the lives of our people are changing, and they are gradually becoming socialist nations.

The solid foundation of our people's democratic system is the strong public socialist component in the national economy. The socialist component has become the only dominant factor in all sectors except agriculture.

The socialist management method in various sectors of the national economy proves that it is completely superior to the old capitalist mode of production, which is evidenced by the unprecedented increase in our country's productivity.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, our working people have victoriously completed the tasks of the first five-year plan. The People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia has achieved a level of national economic development that has never been seen in the history of our people. It took the capitalist economy almost one hundred and forty years to reach the industrial level of 1937. Under the people's democratic system, we have exceeded this level by more than one time in five years. We have made unprecedented achievements in the industrialization of Slovakia. Slovakia was intentionally turned into an agricultural appendage of the Czech Republic and a supplier of cheap labor during the capitalist era, but now it is rapidly becoming a highly developed industrial area. Slovakia's industrial production has increased to more than four and a half times the pre-war level.

Due to the fundamental changes in the national economy, tremendous changes have also taken place in the social and class conditions. The exploiting class of factory owners, bankers, and landlords has been eliminated.

We are implementing a policy of restriction and squeezing out towards the last capitalist class in the country—the rich peasant class. Thoroughly implementing this policy towards the rich peasants can gradually reduce their possibility of economically oppressing small and middle peasants and exploiting the labor of others.

Our country's most progressive social force—the working class—has grown and strengthened. The working class in Slovakia has become particularly strong.

Under the leadership of our party, the working class and the laboring peasants have formed an alliance—the foundation for the survival of the people's democratic state. The unbreakable worker-peasant alliance and its continuous consolidation and strengthening are the guarantee for building socialism in our country.

Our intellectuals are also changing. New people's intellectuals who are connected with the working class in terms of class relations and ideology are gradually growing up. Their numbers are constantly increasing. Our entire intellectual class is a huge force, and they are actively participating in the fruitful work in our country's economy and culture.

The tremendous achievements we have made in all aspects of construction are clearly reflected in the improvement of the people's lives and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural lives of the working people.

Novotny also pointed out the great victory that the working people have achieved in the recent election of the People's Committees. He said that anyone who takes a look at the results of the election will understand that our working people firmly support the people's democratic system. Only six percent voted against the candidates of our National Front—this is indeed a negligible proportion! Moreover, many of these six percent of negative votes are against individual candidates proposed by the National Front, and by no means disagree with our system and our policies.

When talking about the situation in individual sectors of the national economy, Novotny said: Our country has extensively launched basic construction according to the policy of socialist industrialization in order to transform and further develop industry and transportation. During the five-year plan, the state's investment reached 83.2 billion crowns. During the first five-year plan, the production of means of production increased by 118.7 percent, and its proportion in the total industrial output increased from 57.6 percent to 62.3 percent. During the same period, the production of consumer goods increased by 79.8 percent.

Calculated on a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia's coal mining volume in 1951-1952 ranked ninth in the world, pig iron production ranked seventh, and steel production ranked sixth.

During the five-year plan, our electricity production has exceeded France and Italy, steel production has exceeded Sweden and France, and is almost catching up with the United Kingdom.

The reason why we have achieved these achievements is because our country belongs to the peace and socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

According to the party's general line, heavy industry has developed particularly rapidly: the machinery manufacturing industry has become the leading sector of our industry, and the current production volume of this sector has increased to 3.3 times that of 1948.

The metallurgical industry has also had tremendous development. During the five-year plan, the production of pig iron increased by 69 percent, steel increased by 67 percent, and steel materials increased by 73 percent.

Novotny also pointed out the tremendous achievements in light industry, the chemical industry, and the construction industry.

He then pointed out that during the five-year plan, the structure of our industry and the entire national economy has fundamentally changed. We have greatly exceeded the pre-war level. Nevertheless, the phenomenon of disproportionate development left over from capitalist Czechoslovakia has not been eliminated in our national economy until now; we have not sufficiently adhered to the principle of planned and proportionate development of the national economy.

During the five-year plan, the labor productivity of industry increased by 60 percent, and the construction industry increased by 52 percent.

Comrade Novotny then talked about the draft directives of the 10th Party Congress on the plan for the development of the national economy in 1955 and the draft directives of the short-term plan for greatly increasing agricultural production in the past two or three years.

Novotny said that the purpose of the proposed drafts and the national plan for 1954 is to eliminate the disproportionate phenomena between the various sectors of industry and between industry and agriculture, so as to create the premise for the proportionate development of the national economy in the coming years.

When talking about agriculture, Novotny said: Since the Ninth Party Congress, the face of our countryside has fundamentally changed. Under the leadership of the party and with the active support of the working class, the laboring peasants have established many unified agricultural cooperatives. Almost 47 percent of the rural areas have cooperatives, and these cooperatives cultivate about 33 percent of the total cultivated land area. The land of the cooperatives plus the state-owned farms accounts for 43 percent of the total cultivated land area. Two hundred and fifty-six machine tractor stations are vigorously helping the development of agriculture, especially helping the development of unified agricultural cooperatives. The total value of crop products increased by 12.4 percent. The average unit area yield per hectare of grain increased by 21 percent, and potatoes increased by 13 percent. Due to the expansion of the cultivated land area, the harvest of industrial raw material crops has also increased.

In 1953, the proportion of agricultural cooperatives in the production of various crops was: wheat—44.4 percent, naked rye—37.6 percent, barley—44.2 percent, oats—39.2 percent, potatoes—34.4 percent, sugar beets—46.6 percent.

We have also achieved achievements in improving animal husbandry. The number of cattle has increased by 11 percent compared with 1948, and the number of pigs and sheep has greatly exceeded the pre-war level.

In the total number of livestock, the proportion accounted for by the socialist agricultural economic component is: cattle—38 percent, pigs—51 percent.

Novotny pointed out that the leading agencies have not paid enough attention to solving the problems in agriculture and overcoming the shortcomings in agriculture. Novotny emphatically pointed out that it can even be said that the relevant agencies, from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture to the organizations in various regions, often underestimated these important issues. Not enough attention was paid to land cultivation and the mechanization of agricultural production.

The party and government have taken resolute measures to create all the conditions for vigorously improving our country's agriculture.

The increase in the purchase price of agricultural products and the great reduction in the price of industrial products have brought great benefits to the peasants. Other measures, such as lowering the compulsory sales quota and issuing loans to agricultural production cooperatives, are also of the same importance.

The cooperatives have resisted the attacks of the rich peasants and the enemies of our democratic system.

The increase in the degree of agricultural mechanization and the transition to the socialist mode of production have promoted the increase in agricultural labor productivity.

In 1953, the cultivation work carried out by the machine tractor stations accounted for 49 percent of the total cultivation work, and harvested 35 percent of the grain.

When talking about the work of state-owned farms, Novotny pointed out that some great achievements have been made in this regard. The foundation of state-owned farms has expanded three times compared with 1949.

The part played by state-owned farms in the food supply to residents is particularly important. Novotny said that the achievements made by state-owned farms cannot satisfy us.

Our state-owned farms should prove with their exemplary management methods that they are truly the highest form of large-scale socialist agricultural production.

Novotny criticized the work of the procurement agencies, and he particularly pointed out that extensive support and assistance must be provided to all small peasant economies and middle peasants.

Novotny then said that the development of our country's agricultural production in the past two or three years must be considered a major link in the development of Czechoslovakia's national economy. All working people, all state agencies, and all parties and mass organizations must concentrate their attention and strength on vigorously improving agricultural production. This task is arduous, but it is also pleasant. This is the task of all the people in our country, a truly national task.

Further strengthening unified agricultural cooperatives politically, organizationally, and economically is the main prerequisite for developing agricultural production.

We must constantly touch the hearts and minds of the laboring peasants, patiently persuade them, and absorb them into the socialist cooperatives on the principle of voluntariness. For their own interests, and in order to make our countryside live a good, pleasant, and prosperous life, we have done this in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future.

Novotny also made a detailed analysis of the situation in domestic trade and foreign trade, and he pointed out that the turnover of goods is increasing, and Czechoslovakia's trade with many countries has greatly expanded. He also talked about the situation in transportation.

Novotny also used a special part to talk about the improvement of the material and cultural level of the working people.

Novotny said that in the process of implementing the five-year plan, the achievements made in the economic aspect have created the premise for vigorously improving the people's living standards. In five years, the national income increased by 59 percent. In 1954, the expenses for private needs accounted for 58 percent of the national income, and the expenses for public needs accounted for 16 percent. A large part of the national income is used to expand socialist production.

During the five-year plan, with the development of production, the number of employees in various sectors of the national economy increased by more than one-fourth, and the number of employees in the industrial sector increased by more than one-third.

In order to consolidate the economy and to eliminate the circulation of excess currency in the hands of the remaining capitalist elements and parasitic elements, we implemented currency reform.

The currency reform normalized our economy, issued stable Czechoslovak crowns, thus enabling us to embark on the road of planned price reduction.

He pointed out that three price reductions have been implemented in the country in the past year, giving residents a benefit of 10.7 billion crowns. The prices of some industrial products, electricity bills, and gas bills are now greatly reduced compared to before the war.

During the first five-year plan, more than 131,100 houses were built for residents. Private houses accounted for 47,200 houses. Living conditions have improved considerably compared to the capitalist era. However, due to the increase in population, housing construction cannot meet the growing needs, especially in the most important economic areas.

Therefore, the total investment in housing construction in 1954 has increased, in order to build at least 40,000 new houses for residents. In addition, private individuals can also obtain state assistance to build 10,000 new houses.

Currently, 97 percent of the residential areas have been electrified. All residential areas in the country have telephones.

In the past five years, health care has also been greatly improved. New hospitals have been built, and many health care institutions have been renovated and newly built. Now, there is one doctor for every 760 people, while in 1937, there was one doctor for every 1,218 people.

The working people's recuperation in the sanatoriums and rest homes of the trade unions helps to improve the people's health. Last year, about 300,000 working people recuperated in these places, which is twice as many as in 1948.

During the five-year plan, the number of nurseries increased more than four times, and many new kindergartens were established.

All these measures have helped to reduce infant mortality. The annual increase in the population of our republic is 3.3 times that of the capitalist era. Due to this favorable development, in the past five years, the number of Czechoslovak residents has increased by almost 500,000, so that in 1953 the total population reached 12,815,000. This is another proof of the superiority of the people's democratic system over the capitalist system.

When talking about the development of national education, Novotny said that the number of students in technical schools has increased by 88 percent compared to 1948. Now Czechoslovakia has 39 universities with 47,000 students.

He also pointed out the great achievements in the development of science, literature, and art.

Novotny said that our people's democratic system has created all the prerequisites for the rapid development of literature and art. To fully develop these possibilities and enrich our lives and culture with new excellent works depends on cultural workers.

Novotny then said that the instructions of the Ninth Congress on improving the material and cultural level of the working people have been basically completed. The material and cultural level of the people has reached a height that has never been reached and could not be reached at any time under the capitalist system. This is the result of the constructive labor of our people, and it also confirms the correctness of the Communist Party's policies.

Novotny then talked about the issue of further strengthening the people's democratic social and state system. He said that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is the leading force and organizational force of our society, and the policy it implements is to tirelessly strengthen our country. For this reason, it is necessary to first attract the broad masses of the people to actively participate in the management and construction of the country. In the daily struggle for their own basic vital interests—for peace, for socialist construction, for improving material and cultural levels. The vast majority of all citizens (although there are still differences among our workers) have formed a solid unified whole. In the process of expanding the socialist economic system, eliminating the landlord and capitalist classes, restricting the rich peasants, and educating the working people with socialist ideas, the spiritual and political unity of the Czechoslovak people has gradually been formed and strengthened. The embodiment of this unity of the working people in urban and rural areas is the National Front. The Ninth Party Congress put forward a task to the entire party, to make the National Front devote itself to thoroughly eradicating all attempts to restore capitalism, and to unite our people to actively participate in the cause of socialist construction and defending peace.

The worker-peasant alliance is the political basis of the National Front, and it is the indispensable condition and guarantee for the victorious transition from capitalism to socialism.

Novotny pointed out that in the period mentioned in the report, there were some mistakes in the relationship between workers and peasants.

Novotny then emphatically pointed out that vigorously improving the work of the state agencies—an important tool for socialist construction—has particularly important significance today.

Novotny emphatically pointed out that in order to achieve the complete victory of socialism, and in order to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the working people, the party's work must focus on the following very important tasks in domestic affairs:

Guarantee the completion of the 1954-1955 national economic development plan, and create conditions for the proportionate development of the economy in the second five-year plan;

Vigorously improve agricultural production in the next two or three years;

Quickly overcome the phenomenon that the fuel, power, and mining base lags behind the needs of the national economy, increase the production of consumer goods and improve their quality;

Reduce costs in all departments of the national economy and state management agencies, and strictly abide by the system of thrift;

Through socialist competition, increasingly broadly develop and utilize the creative initiative of the working people;

Tirelessly strengthen national defense forces and educate the people to further improve political vigilance.

We will consolidate the people's democratic state and social system in all aspects, and attract the working people to actively participate in the work of state power and managing the country.

Novotny then said: Our Communist Party is convening the Tenth Congress in a situation where it is united, well-tempered, and closely united around the Central Committee.

The party's ideological and organizational unity, and its unwavering loyalty to the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, are the main characteristics of our party's life.

The Tenth Congress represents 1,385,610 party members and 103,624 alternate party members. The entire party has a total of 1,489,234 party members and alternate party members.

The Central Committee of the Party recognizes that the strength of the Communist Party lies not only in the number of party members, but first of all in the quality of party members. Therefore, during the period mentioned in the report, it has taken several important measures to conduct political and ideological education for party members, and to improve the party's social composition and adjust the party's development.

Due to the fact that the conspirators and traitors adopted incorrect and harmful methods of recruiting party members, some opportunists, passive elements, careerists, and hostile elements sneaked into the party. The party has purged these elements.

Novotny continued to say that the great tasks of socialist construction require the party's work to conform to the level of these tasks, and to systematically improve to the appropriate level. Therefore, what urgently needs to be done is to pay attention to the party's ideological and political work and organizational work, and to correctly realize the party's leading role in all aspects of our country's life. It is a great mistake to think that bourgeois ideology and its influence only exist outside the party. The Communist Party is not separated from the outside world by an insurmountable high wall. Class enemies are constantly trying to infiltrate the party from the outside and influence certain party members.

Novotny talked about the need to continue to oppose various bourgeois nationalism and opportunism, to continue to oppose the remnants of social democratic ideas that have not yet been eradicated, and to further improve the party's educational level and the level of the party's propaganda among the masses.

Novotny concluded by saying: In the period after the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, we have achieved great victories in the struggle to realize our party's general line, and in the struggle to achieve socialism. Our people's democratic motherland has become stronger, and the people's lives have become better and happier.

Our people have the right to be proud of the work achievements they have achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

Our current task is to continue to fight for the final victory of socialism in our country.

Novotny shouted: Long live the great peace camp! Long live the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union! Long live the unbreakable worker-peasant alliance! Long live the People's Democratic Republic of Czechoslovakia and the Czechoslovak people! Long live the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia!

Advance to new victories of socialism under the invincible banner of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin!

    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会上
    安·诺沃提尼作捷共中央工作
    总结和今后党的任务的报告
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记安·诺沃提尼，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会十一日会议上，作了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会工作总结和今后党的任务的报告。
    诺沃提尼在报告中说，过去的五年，在我们党和全国的生活中是一个极其重要的时期，从国际关系的发展上来看也同样是一个极其重要的时期。
    在这个时期中，由于苏联解放了我国，由于以共产党所领导的工人阶级为首的我国人民进行的解放斗争，我国的人民民主制度产生了，这一制度进
  一步加强和胜利地向前发展了。
    在我国解放四年后所举行的第九次党代表大会
  （按在一九四九年五月举行）提出了在我国建设社会主义的总路线。这个时期，政权已完全掌握在团结一致的工人阶级的手中，工人阶级和劳动农民结成了巩固的联盟，它在共产党所领导的复兴了的民族阵线中居于首位，在一九四八年二月这个值得纪念的月份里，它坚决地粉碎了资产阶级公开企图以反革命政变方式使资本主义复辟的阴谋。
    在第九次党代表大会以前我们已胜利地结束了工业恢复时期，在我国的经济中已出现了强大的和不断加强着的社会主义经济成分。在农村中，劳动农民在工人阶级支持下，与最后一个也是最残忍的一个剥削阶级——富农阶级进行残酷斗争的过程中改变了对农业集体经营方式、对合作化的社会主义大生产的态度。这就是国内情况的主要特点。
    我国的国际政治形势也有利于我们人民民主制度的进一步发展，这是因为我们与我们的解放者、最好的朋友和我们自由、独立与和平建设的强大支柱——伟大的苏联紧密地联结在一起，并因为我们是以苏联为首的强大的民主阵营的一个牢固的组成部分。
    今天我们可以自豪地说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会是在我国社会主义建设事业大踏步胜利前进的情况下举行的。在总结报告所谈到的时期中，我们本着第九次代表大会的决议的精神成长壮大了，并且像爱护眼珠一样地爱护我们党的团结一致、壮大和它的战斗力。社会主义建设的日益繁重的任务和为完成社会主义建设任务而进行的斗争，加强了并锻炼了捷克斯洛伐克共产党——我们人民一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者。斯兰斯基恶毒的匪帮被破获了和消灭了，从而也就粉碎了反对捷克斯洛伐克共和国及其人民的广泛阴谋，而这种阴谋是企图推翻人民民主制度和在我国恢复旧的资本主义制度。
    我们使这个匪帮无能为害，我们砍掉了帝国主义者的危险的第五纵队的头，从而，党再一次地显示了它对工人阶级、人民和社会主义是不可动摇地忠诚的。
    诺沃提尼在谈到国际贸易、国际形势以及捷克斯洛伐克的外交政策时指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九次代表大会之后的时期中的国际形势的特点是和平、民主和社会主义力量的不断壮大。
    诺沃提尼详细地谈到和平阵营国家所获得的成就。他说，在总结报告的时期中，民主阵营的内部更加巩固了。这个阵营里的国家相互间的经济和文化合作发展并加强了。这个阵营的领导力量——苏联，在这段时期中在通往共产主义的崇高目标的道路上迈进了很重要的一步。
    诺沃提尼说，美国帝国主义者所执行的臭名远扬的“实力”政策遭到了彻底的失败。各国人民都指责这种政策。他们要求禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器，要求建立集体安全体系。
    诺沃提尼说，最近时期，我们亲眼看到足以导致消除亚洲的两个战争策源地的极重大的事件。我们指的是由苏联提议召开的、目前正在进行的日内瓦会议。国际广泛的舆论界都欢迎这一会议的召开。会议一开始就出现了两种解决国际问题的主张。一种主张是，无论如何要保持对亚洲各国的殖民统治，虽然这一地区已经发生了历史性的变革。这是美国反动军国主义者集团代表的政策。第二种主张是，希望在和平的条件下建设自己生活的各国人民应有独立的权利，有自己决定自己命运的权利。这是苏联、中华人民共和国和民主社会主义阵营的其他国家的政策。
    我们党和政府的外交政策的首要任务就是执行为保卫世界和平、保证我国和平的社会主义建设而斗争的政策。
    这个政策是符合一心一意争取和平的我国人民的切身利益的。因此，我们的党和政府现在和将来都完全支持苏联的和平外交政策。
    我们要永远遵循哥特瓦尔德同志的遗训，他教导我们说，“要建设社会主义、保障我国民族自由和国家独立、维护和平——这一切，如果不和强大的苏联结成巩固的联盟，是不可想像的。”
    我们将继续加强与苏联的联盟和兄弟友谊，关心能大大促进我国繁荣的我们两国的经济和文化的联系的相互发展。
    诺沃提尼接着谈到捷克斯洛伐克人民与伟大的中国人民及波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜和蒙古人民友谊的日益加强的联系。他说，我们将不倦地加强和我们共同站在保卫和平这条牢不可破的战线上的国家的相互联系。
    诺沃提尼说道，目前我国国境的大部分是和平、友好和互相尊敬的国境。我们与德意志民主共和国相互关系的发展是有历史意义的事实。由于在德意志民主共和国内已永远消灭了压迫德国人民的各种因素，永远消灭了军国主义和法西斯主义，我们相互关系的新时代即友好合作的时代来到了，它并将一直发展下去。
    目前捷克斯洛伐克和六十二个国家保持有外交关系。我国人民热烈拥护苏联关于确保欧洲和世界的巩固的安全的建议。我们愿意与所有的国家和平共处，不管这些国家的制度和政治制度如何，我们与和平和国际安全的真正捍卫者们一道将尽一切努力使欧洲集体安全条约得以实现。我们要再接再厉地反抗在西德恢复德国军国主义的一切企图。我们要竭力反对策划新的德奥合并，我们要全力支持为统一、民主与和平的德国而斗争的力量。我们要全力支持为争取裁军及禁止生产和使用大规模毁灭性的武器的斗争。
    诺沃提尼接着谈到捷克斯洛伐克国内的情况。他说：在社会主义建设方面所达到的成果极其明显地证实了我们人民民主制度的巨大的生命力，它的牢不可破的坚固性与不断增长的力量。从丑恶的资本主义统治之下解放出来了的劳动人民的创造力和精力是无穷无尽的。我国的面貌正在改变，我国各族人民的生活也在改变，他们都逐渐成为社会主义的民族。
    我国人民民主制度坚固的基础是国民经济中强大的公有的社会主义成分。社会主义成分已在农业之外的一切部门中成了唯一占统治地位的因素。
    国民经济各部门的社会主义经营方式证实它完全优越于旧的、资本主义的生产方式，我国生产力的空前提高就是证明。
    我国劳动人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下，胜利地完成了第一个五年计划的任务。人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国达到了我国人民历史上从未有过的国民经济的发展。资本主义经济差不多花了一百四十年的功夫才达到一九三七年的工业水平。而在人民民主制度的条件下，我们五年功夫就超过了这一水平的一倍以上。我们在斯洛伐克工业化方面取得了空前的成就。斯洛伐克在资本主义时代，被有意地变成了捷克的农业附属地和廉价劳动力的供应地，而现在它正在迅速地变成工业高度发达的地区。斯洛伐克的工业生产量已经增为战前水平的四倍半以上。
    由于全国的经济发生了根本的变化，社会状况和阶级状况也发生了巨大的变化。剥削阶级的工厂主、银行家和地主阶级都被消灭了。
    对国内最后一个资本主义的阶级——富农阶级，我们正实行限制和排挤的政策。彻底实行这一对富农的政策，就可以逐渐缩小他们在经济上压迫小农和中农以及剥削别人的劳动的可能性。
    我国最进步的社会力量——工人阶级已经壮大和坚强起来。斯洛伐克的工人阶级特别强大起来了。
    在我们党的领导下，工人阶级和劳动农民结成了联盟——人民民主国家生存的基础。牢不可破的工农联盟及其不断巩固和加强，是我国建成社会主义的保证。
    我们的知识分子也在变化着。新的、在阶级关系和思想方面同工人阶级联系在一起的人民知识分子正逐步成长起来。他们的数目在不断地增加。我们的整个知识分子阶层是一支巨大的力量，他们正积极地参加我国经济和文化等方面的有成果的工作。
    我们在建设的各方面所取得的巨大成就，明显地反映在人民生活的改善上，反映在劳动人民物质与文化生活的不断提高上。
    诺沃提尼还指出了劳动人民在最近一次人民委员会的选举中所获得的巨大胜利。他说，无论是谁，只要一看选举的结果就会明白：我国劳动人民是坚决地拥护人民民主制度的。投票反对我们民族阵线候选人的只有百分之六——这的确是一个微不足道的比例！况且这百分之六的反对票中，有许多票是反对民族阵线提出的个别的候选人，而决不是不同意我们的制度和我们的政策。
    诺沃提尼在谈到国民经济中个别部门的情况时说：我国已根据社会主义工业化的政策广泛地展开了基本建设，以改造并进一步发展工业及运输。五年计划期间国家的投资已达八百三十二亿克朗。在第一个五年计划期间，生产资料的生产已增加了百分之一百一十八点七，它在工业总产量中的比例已由百分之五十七点六增加到百分之六十二点三。在同一时期内，消费品的生产增加了百分之七十九点八。
    如按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克一九五一年—一九五二年的采煤量占世界第九位，铣铁产量占第七位，钢的产量占第六位。
    五年计划期间，我们电力的生产已超过了法国和意大利，钢的生产已超过了瑞典和法国，并几乎赶上了英国。
    我们之所以获得了这些成就，是因为我们的国家是属于苏联领导的和平、社会主义阵营的。
    根据党的总路线，重工业发展得特别迅速：机器制造业成了我们工业的领导部门，目前这一部门的生产量已增为一九四八年的三点三倍。
    冶金工业也有了巨大的发展。五年计划期间铣铁的生产增加了百分之六十九，钢增加了百分之六十七，钢材增加了百分之七十三。
    诺沃提尼并指出了轻工业，化学工业和建筑工业方面的巨大成就。
    他接着指出，五年计划期间，我们工业和整个国民经济的结构已经根本改变了。我们大大地超过了战前水平。虽然如此，但我们国民经济中直到现在还没有铲除资本主义捷克斯洛伐克遗留下来的发展不成比例的现象；我们对有计划、按比例发展国民经济的原则遵守得还不够。
    五年计划期间，工业的劳动生产率提高了百分之六十，建筑业提高了百分之五十二。
    诺沃提尼同志接着谈到第十次党代表大会关于一九五五年发展国民经济计划的指示草案和最近两三年内大大提高农业生产的短期计划的指示草案。
    诺沃提尼说，所提出的各项草案以及一九五四年的国家计划的目的是为了消除工业各部门之间以及工业和农业之间的不成比例的现象，以便为今后几年中国民经济的按比例发展创造前提。
    诺沃提尼谈到农业时说道：自第九次党代表大会举行以来，我国农村的面貌已经根本地改变了。劳动农民在党的领导下，在工人阶级的积极支援下已建立起许多统一农业合作社。几乎百分之四十七的农村都有合作社，这些合作社耕作着约占全部耕地面积百分之三十三的土地。合作社加上国营农场的土地共占全部耕地面积的百分之四十三。有二百五十六个机器拖拉机站在大力帮助农业的发展，特别是帮助统一农业合作社的发展。农作物产品的总值增加了百分之十二点四。每公顷谷物的单位面积产量平均提高了百分之二十一，马铃薯提高了百分之十三。由于耕地面积的扩大，工业原料作物的收获量也增加了。
    一九五三年农业合作社在各种作物生产中所占的比重为：小麦——百分之四十四点四、裸麦——百分之三十七点六、大麦——百分之四十四点二、燕麦——百分之三十九点二、马铃薯——百分之三十四点四、甜菜——百分之四十六点六。
    在畜牧业提高方面我们也获得了成就。牛的头数比一九四八年增加了百分之十一，而猪和羊的只数已大大超过战前水平。
    在总牲畜头数中，社会主义农业经济成分所占的比重为：牛——百分之三十八，猪——百分之五十一。
    诺沃提尼指出，领导机构对于解决农业中的问题和克服农业中的缺点，没有予以足够的注意。诺沃提尼着重指出，甚至可以说，有关机关，从国家计划委员会和农业部起到各区的组织，对于这些重要的问题往往估计不足。对于土地耕作和农业生产机械化工作没有加以足够的注意。
    党和政府已采取了坚决措施，来为大力提高我国农业创造一切条件。
    农产品采购价格的提高和工业品价格的大大降低使农民得到了很大的好处。其他如降低义务交售定额、对农业生产合作社发放贷款等措施也具有同样重要的意义。
    合作社抵抗住了富农和我们民主制度的敌人的进攻。
    农业机械化程度的增长和向社会主义生产方式的过渡推进了农业劳动生产率的提高。
    一九五三年，机器拖拉机站所进行的耕种工作占全部耕种工作的百分之四十九，收割了百分之三十五的谷物。
    诺沃提尼谈到国营农场工作时指出，在这方面已取得了一些巨大的成绩。国营农场的基础比一九四九年扩大了三倍。
    国营农场在对居民的粮食供应中所占的部分是特别重要的。诺沃提尼说道，但是国营农场方面所取得的成绩还不能使我们满足。
    我们的国营农场应该以模范的经营方式证明：它们是真正最高级的大规模社会主义农业生产的形式。
    诺沃提尼对采购机关的工作进行了批评，他特别提出，必须对所有的小农经济和中农进行广泛的支持和帮助。
    诺沃提尼接着说，最近两三年中我国农业生产的发展，必须认为是捷克斯洛伐克国民经济发展的一个主要环节。全体劳动人民、所有的国家机关、所有的党派和群众团体必须把注意力和力量集中在大力提高农业生产上。这一任务是艰巨的，但也是愉快的。这是我国全体人民的任务，真正的全民的任务。
    进一步在政治上、组织上和经济上加强统一农业合作社是发展农业生产的主要前提。
    我们要不断地打动劳动农民的内心和思想，耐心地说服他们，依据自愿的原则吸收他们参加社会主义性质的合作社。为了他们自己的利益，为了使我国农村能过美好的、愉快的和富裕的生活，我们过去已经这样做了，今后还要这样做。
    诺沃提尼对国内贸易与对外贸易的情况也作了详细的分析，他指出，商品流转额正在增加，捷克斯洛伐克和许多国家的贸易已大大扩展了。他并谈到了运输方面的情况。
    诺沃提尼还以专门的一部分来谈劳动人民物质和文化水平提高的情况。
    诺沃提尼说道，在执行五年计划过程中，在经济方面所取得的成绩已为大力提高人民的生活水平创造了前提。在五年中，国民收入提高了百分之五十九。一九五四年，私人需要方面的费用占国民收入的百分之五十八，用在公共需要方面占百分之十六。国民收入的很大部分是用来扩大社会主义生产的。
    在五年计划期间，随着生产的发展，国民经济各部门中职工的人数增加了四分之一以上，工业部门的职工数量增加了三分之一以上。
    为了巩固经济和为了取缔残余的资本主义分子和寄生分子手中的过剩货币的流通，我们实行了币制改革。
    币制改革使得我们经济正常化，发行了稳定的捷克斯洛伐克克朗，从而使我们有可能走向有计划地减低物价的道路。
    他指出，最近一年国内实行了三次减低物价，使居民获得一百零七亿克朗的好处。有些工业品的价格、电费和煤气费，现在已比战前大大减低了。
    在第一个五年计划期间，为居民建筑了十三万一千一百余幢住宅。私人建筑的住宅有四万七千二百幢。居住条件比资本主义时代有了相当的改善。但是，由于人口的增加，住宅建设还不能满足日益增长的需要，特别是在最重要的经济地区尤其如此。
    因此，一九五四年对住宅建筑的投资总额增加了，为的是至少给居民建筑四万幢新的住宅。此外，私人还可获得国家的帮助来建筑一万幢新的房屋。
    目前，百分之九十七的居民区已经电气化了。国内所有的居民区都有了电话。
    在过去的五年中，保健事业也有了很大的改善。新的医院建筑起来了，并且改建和新建了许多卫生医疗机构。现在，每七百六十个人就有一个医生，而在一九三七年，一千二百一十八个人中才有一个医生。
    劳动人民在工会的疗养院和休养所中休养，有助于增进人民的健康。去年约有三十万劳动人民在这些地方休养，比一九四八年多一倍。
    在五年计划期间，托儿所的数目增加为四倍多，并建立了许多新的幼儿园。
    所有这些措施都有助于减低儿童的死亡率。我们共和国每年人口的增加数目为资本主义时代的三点三倍。由于这种有利的发展，在过去的五年当中，捷克斯洛伐克居民的数目几乎增加了五十万人，于是在一九五三年人口总数达到一千二百八十一万五千人。这又是人民民主制度优越于资本主义制度的一个证明。
    诺沃提尼谈到国民教育的发展时说，技术学校学生的数目已比一九四八年增加了百分之八十八，现在捷克斯洛伐克有高等学校三十九所，学生四万七千人。
    他还指出了科学、文学和艺术发展方面的巨大成就。
    诺沃提尼说，我们的人民民主制度为迅速发展文学和艺术创造了一切前提。充分发挥这些可能性，以新的优秀作品来丰富我们的生活与文化，这就有赖于文化工作者了。
    诺沃提尼接着说，第九次代表大会关于提高劳动人民的物质与文化水平的指示已基本上完成了。人民的物质和文化水平已达到了在资本主义制度下任何时候都不曾达到过而且也不可能达到的高度。这是我国人民建设性的劳动的成果，同时也证实了共产党的政策的正确性。
    诺沃提尼接着谈到进一步加强人民民主的社会和国家制度的问题。他说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党是我国社会的领导力量与组织力量，它所实行的方针是不倦地加强我们的国家，为此，就首先要吸引广大的人民群众积极参加国家的管理和建设。在为了自己的基本切身利益——为和平、为社会主义建设、为提高物质和文化水平——而进行的日常斗争中。全体公民的绝大多数（尽管我们的劳动者之间还存在着区别）结成了一个巩固的统一的整体。在扩大社会主义的经济制度、消灭地主和资本家阶级、限制富农及用社会主义思想教育劳动人民的过程中，逐渐形成和加强了捷克斯洛伐克人民在精神上和政治上的团结一致。城乡劳动人民的这种团结的体现就是民族阵线。第九次党代表大会向全党提出了一个任务，使民族阵线致力于彻底根除一切想使资本主义复辟的企图，致力于团结我国人民来积极参加社会主义建设和保卫和平的事业。
    工农联盟是民族阵线的政治基础，是由资本主义胜利地过渡到社会主义的不可少的条件和保证。
    诺沃提尼指出，在报告所谈到的时期内，在工农关系问题上曾存在过某些错误。
    诺沃提尼接着着重指出，大力改进社会主义建设的重要工具——国家机关的工作，在今天具有特别重要的意义。
    诺沃提尼着重指出，为了取得社会主义的彻底胜利，为了最大限度地满足劳动人民的经常增长的物质和文化需要，党的工作必须集中在下列的内政方面的十分重要的任务上：
    保证完成一九五四—一九五五年国民经济发展计划，为第二个五年计划的经济的按比例发展创造条件；
    在今后两三年内大力提高农业生产；
    迅速克服燃料、动力和采矿基地落后于国民经济需要的现象，增加消费品生产量并提高其质量；
    在国民经济和国家管理机关的各部门中降低成本，最严格地遵守节约制度；
    通过社会主义竞赛，日益广泛地发挥和利用劳动人民的创造积极性；
    不倦地加强国防力量，教育人民进一步提高政治警惕性。
    我们将从各方面巩固人民民主的国家和社会制度，吸引劳动人民积极参加国家政权和管理国家的工作。
    诺沃提尼接着说：我们共产党是在团结一致的、久经锻炼的、紧密地团结在中央委员会周围的情况下召开第十次代表大会的。
    党的思想上和组织上的团结、对于马克思—列宁主义思想毫不动摇的忠实，是我们党的生活的主要特点。
    第十次代表大会代表了一百三十八万五千六百一十个党员和十万零三千六百二十四个候补党员。全党共有一百四十八万九千二百三十四个党员和候补党员。
    党中央委员会认识到，共产党的力量不仅在于党员的数量，而首先在于党员的质量，因此在报告所谈到的期间内采取了若干重要措施，对党员进行政治和思想的教育，并改善党的社会成份和调整党的发展。
    由于阴谋分子——叛徒采取不正确的和有害的接收党员的方法，使一些机会主义分子、消极分子、名利分子和敌对分子钻进党内。党已经清洗了这些分子。
    诺沃提尼继续说，进行社会主义建设的伟大任务要求党的工作符合这些任务的水平，有计划地提高到应有的水平。因此，迫切需要做的是注意党的思想—政治工作和组织工作，以及在我国生活的各方面正确地实现党的领导作用。认为资产阶级思想及其影响只有党外才有，那是极大的错误。共产党并没有不可逾越的高墙和外界相隔绝。阶级敌人不断地企图从外面渗入党里来，并影响某些党员。
    诺沃提尼谈到必须继续反对各种资产阶级民族主义和机会主义的表现，必须继续反对依然未根绝的社会民主思想的遗毒，必须进一步提高党的教育水平和党在群众中进行宣传的水平。
    诺沃提尼最后说：在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第九次代表大会以后的时期中，我们在为实现我们党的总路线的斗争中，在争取实现社会主义的斗争中，获得了巨大的胜利。我们的人民民主的祖国已变得更加强大，人民的生活更加美好和幸福了。
    我国人民有权以在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下所获得的工作成果而自豪。
    我们当前的任务是继续为实现社会主义在我国的最终胜利而斗争。
    诺沃提尼高呼：伟大的和平阵营万岁！苏联和苏联共产党万岁！牢不可破的工农联盟万岁！人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国和捷克斯洛伐克人民万岁！捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁！
    在马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的战无不胜的旗帜下，向社会主义的新的胜利前进！
