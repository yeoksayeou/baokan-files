The draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao and adopted by the Central People's Government Committee, has been promulgated. This is a matter of great historical significance.

I participated in the discussion of the initial draft of the Constitution. At first, I thought, how could I understand the Constitution? I held a learning attitude aside. However, after participating in the actual discussion, I quickly realized that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, closely related to the lives of the broad masses of the people. Everyone needs to understand it, which made me further realize the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, and also deepened my love for the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and made me more aware of the close relationship between myself and the country.

The draft Constitution specifically and practically, in accordance with the state's transitional period, stipulates the general task of the transitional period, the social system and state organs, as well as the basic rights and obligations of citizens, etc. These provisions fully embody our country's democratic system and the requirements and will of our people to gradually realize a socialist society. Our draft Constitution is completely opposite to the constitutions of capitalist countries that guarantee the exploitation system. Our draft Constitution is a powerful guarantee of the power and interests of the people. The draft Constitution stipulates that all citizens are equal before the law; it stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life, and that marriage, family, mothers and children are protected by the state, and the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people; it stipulates the citizens' right to work, right to rest, right to education, the right of workers to receive material assistance when they are old, sick or lose their ability to work, and the state's encouragement and assistance to scientific, educational and cultural workers... All these provisions are in stark contrast to the oppression and exploitation of the people, the discrimination against ethnic groups, and the lack of political status of working women in capitalist countries.

I am a female medical scientist who has experienced the dark period of reactionary rule and encountered oppression and discrimination. We had no security, let alone the rights of democracy and freedom. The revolution was victorious. In our new country, the people became the masters of the country, science was valued by the Party and the government, scientists were respected by the people, and they could better serve the people. Now, the draft Constitution also stipulates the protection and encouragement and assistance to scientific workers. This is something that could not have been imagined in the past. How could it not make me excited and proud of my motherland!

This draft Constitution has been carefully and repeatedly studied word by word, and will be discussed among the people of the whole country after its promulgation. I wholeheartedly support it, and I am determined to work hard under the leadership of the Party for its thorough realization, and in my own work post, learn from the Soviet Union and strive for the country's health construction cause.

### 宪法草案给了我最大的鼓励

    宪法草案给了我最大的鼓励
    中国协和医学院妇产科学系主任　林巧稚
    毛主席亲自参加起草的，经过中央人民政府委员会通过的中华人民共和国宪法草案公布了。这是一件具有伟大历史意义的事情。
    我参加了宪法草案初稿的讨论。起初，我想我怎能懂得宪法呢？我抱着在一旁学习的态度。但参加实际讨论后，很快我就体会到宪法是国家根本大法，密切关系着广大人民的生活，每一个人都需要懂得它，因而使我更进一步地体会到我们国家的人民民主制度的优越性，也使我更加深了对中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，更体会到自己和国家的亲切关系。
    宪法草案具体而又实际地按照国家过渡时期的情况，规定了过渡时期的总任务，规定了社会制度和国家机构以及公民的基本权利和义务等等。这些规定都充分体现了我国的民主制度和体现了我国人民逐步实现社会主义社会的要求和意志。我们的宪法草案和保障剥削制度的资本主义国家的宪法完全相反，我国宪法草案是人民权力和利益的有力保证。宪法草案规定了公民在法律上一律平等；规定了妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利，婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童受国家的保护，国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展；规定了公民的劳动权、休息权、受教育权，劳动者在年老、疾病或丧失劳动能力的时候有获得物质帮助的权利，以及国家对科学教育文化工作者的鼓励和帮助……。所有这些规定，都和资本主义国家的人民受压迫剥削、民族受歧视、劳动妇女没有政治地位等，形成明显的对比。
    我是一个女医学科学工作者，经历过反动统治的黑暗时期，遭遇到压迫和歧视。我们没有保障，更谈不上民主和自由的权利。革命胜利了，在我们新国家里，人民作了国家的主人，科学受到党和政府的重视，科学家受到人民的尊敬，能够更好地为人民服务。现在宪法草案中又规定了对科学工作者的保障和给予鼓励和帮助，这是过去多少年来不可想像的事，怎能不使我兴奋和为祖国而骄傲啊！
    这个宪法草案，一字一句都经过了认真的、反复的研究，公布以后还要在全国人民中进行讨论。我衷心地拥护它，并决心在党的领导下，为它的彻底实现而努力，在自己的工作岗位上，学习苏联，为国家卫生建设事业而奋斗。
