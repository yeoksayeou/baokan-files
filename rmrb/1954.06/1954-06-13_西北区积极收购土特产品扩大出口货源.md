The trade corporations in various parts of the Northwest Region are actively purchasing native and special products to expand export sources. The total value of native and medicinal products purchased by trade corporations in the region during the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year increased by 26.42 percent compared to the total value of purchases in the fourth quarter of 1952 and the first quarter of last year. Among the thirty-three kinds of export native products, all except for black moss and almonds have overfulfilled the purchase plans.

The Northwest Region has many kinds of native and special products that can be exported. In the past, many products were wasted or discarded because the masses did not know their value. This year, trade corporations in various places have strengthened publicity work in this regard during the purchase process. The Yili Trade Branch of Xinjiang Province held small-scale symposiums for herdsmen of various ethnic groups, explaining the benefits of purchasing native and special products to the country and the herdsmen. In addition to publicizing the significance of purchasing native and special products at the county's three-level cadre meeting, the Minhe County Trade Branch of Qinghai Province also went deep into the countryside to widely publicize the role of exporting native and special products in supporting national construction. From October last year to March this year, the company purchased native and special products such as walnuts and melon seeds worth more than 340 million yuan. The Liquan County and Yangxian County Trade Branches of Shaanxi Province have strengthened their investigation and research work, and discovered a batch of new native products such as Cyperus rotundus, Rubia cordifolia, and Bupleurum in the local area, and are now launching purchase work.

    西北区积极收购土特产品扩大出口货源
    西北区各地贸易公司积极收购土产、特产，以扩大出口货源。该区各地贸易公司去年第四季度和今年第一季度收购土产、药材的总值，比一九五二年第四季度和去年第一季度的收购总值增加了百分之二十六点四二。其中三十三种出口土产，除发菜、杏仁外，都超额完成了收购计划。
    西北区可以出口的土特产品种类很多，过去由于群众不知道它们的价值，许多产品被浪费或抛弃掉了。今年，各地贸易公司在收购中大都加强了这一方面的宣传工作。新疆省伊犁贸易分公司曾召开各族牧民的小型座谈会，说明了收购土特产品对国家和牧民的好处。青海省民和县贸易支公司除在该县三级干部会议上宣传了收购土特产品的意义以外，还深入农村广泛宣传了出口土特产对支援国家建设的作用。从去年十月到今年三月，该公司就收进了价值三亿四千多万元的核桃、瓜子等土特产品。陕西省醴泉县和洋县贸易支公司由于加强了调查研究工作，在当地发现了一批香附子、茜草、柴胡等新土产，现正展开收购工作。
