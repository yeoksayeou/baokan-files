The urgent desire of the broad masses of the French people for a swift realization of peace in Indochina was once again reflected extremely clearly in the vote of confidence in the Laniel government by the French National Assembly on June 12. The result of the vote of confidence was 306 votes against and 293 votes in favor; the Laniel cabinet was defeated and thus had to submit its collective resignation.

Since the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference decided to hold the Geneva Conference to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina, people from all walks of life in France have expressed widespread welcome and launched a powerful movement demanding an end to the Indochina colonial war. This movement was quickly reflected in the debates of the National Assembly held in March this year, after which a resolution was passed welcoming the Geneva Conference "to end the painful Indochina war." However, during the Geneva Conference, the Laniel government did not act in accordance with the will of the people and national interests. Members of the National Assembly repeatedly requested a debate on the Indochina issue. Laniel insisted on continuing to implement his foreign policy and even used political blackmail to deal with the parliament, demanding a vote of confidence to resist parliamentary debate. Although Laniel barely survived the crisis with a slight majority in the last two votes of confidence, the number of votes of confidence he received had decreased to a majority of only two votes. At that time, the French newspapers warned that for the Laniel government, these two votes were only enough for it to seek peace, but not enough for it to continue the war. But Laniel obviously did not learn the lessons he should have, and continued to play a double game at the Geneva Conference, taking measures to continue the war, and eagerly negotiating with the United States to expand the war, so that the Geneva Conference failed to reach an agreement on the Indochina issue quickly. This practice of the French warmongers could not but arouse extreme dissatisfaction among the people of all strata in France, and the Laniel government was finally unable to avoid the fate of collapse.

The collapse of the Laniel cabinet proves that it is impossible for the French warmongers to disregard the will of the people and implement policies that violate French interests, and that the will and strength of the French people are not to be insulted.

Although the vote of no confidence cast by the French National Assembly this time was less than the statutory absolute majority of 314 votes, Laniel still had to submit his collective resignation, and French President Coty also announced his acceptance and the formation of a new cabinet. This shows that the result of the vote is far from reflecting the degree of people's distrust of the Laniel government's Indochina policy. It is enough to point out that before the vote of confidence was held, Laniel had requested that a motion favorable to the government, advocating that the National Assembly "express its confidence" in it, be put to a vote first, but was rejected by the National Assembly by 324 votes to 269. More importantly, the movement of people from all walks of life in France to strive for a swift end to the Indochina war is growing. Hundreds of delegations from people's organizations and organizations from all walks of life went to Geneva every day to express their desire for peace, which clearly shows this.

People can see from the speeches of members of various parties in the French National Assembly that the current foreign policy of the Laniel-Bidault group is extremely unpopular.

The French Communist Party (which has 96 seats in the National Assembly), which has always advocated seeking a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue, expressed a clear attitude in the parliamentary debate. Communist MP Raymond Guyot pointed out that the question now is: are you willing to truly seek peace in Indochina, or, on the contrary, do you want to sabotage negotiations and expand the war? When he spoke of Bidault's so-called "consistency of policy," he said that this consistency "has brought only shame, bankruptcy, poverty and disregard for national interests in seven years." He said: "Today, in the interests of France, we must seek an agreement that is honorable to both sides, because the breakdown of negotiations means that France is heading for a new catastrophe."

The speeches of many members of other parties also powerfully exposed the essence of the Laniel government's foreign policy. French Radical Socialist MP Daladier accused the government of adopting a policy toward Indochina that was "wrong and absurd." He protested the plan to internationalize the Indochina war and called for efforts to negotiate. Non-party MP Louis Vallon also pointed out: "French government figures have ruined France's independence... The government must stop implementing the policies required by the United States. On the contrary, the government should implement an independent policy and reach an agreement with the people of Indochina." Pierre Meunier, MP of the Republican Union of Progress, criticized the government for not being sincere in seeking a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue in Geneva, saying: "An agreement is possible. The proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam prove this. We must not miss today's opportunity."

What does this show? Recently, in order to cover up its conspiracy to interrupt the Geneva Conference and drag France and other allies into expanding the Indochina war, the US ruling group has tried its best to reverse the facts, confuse the truth, and distort the position and propositions of the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union in striving for an agreement, fabricating rumors that "the attitude of the Soviet Union and China is tough," which has "deteriorated the situation of the conference." However, the speeches of members of various parties in the French National Assembly and the collapse of the Laniel cabinet are not a powerful answer to these rumors with ulterior motives?

The strong will of the general public against the current policy of the Laniel government, as reflected in the French National Assembly debate, is also manifested in the fact that despite the French warmongers and their Washington backers exhausting all means of threats and inducements to treat this parliament, they finally failed to allow the Laniel government to get away with it, maintain its regime, and continue to implement policies that violated the wishes of the French people at the Geneva Conference.

In his speech to the parliament, Bidault tried his best to conceal the true situation of the Geneva Conference, distort the reasons for the slow progress of the conference, avoid the responsibilities that the French delegation should bear, and dress himself up as hoping to restore peace in Indochina. He deceived the parliament, saying that the Laniel government did not play a double game or follow the policy of the United States, but was "doing everything possible to make the negotiations a success" and was working "for France and for peace." Laniel more openly threatened the parliament not to overthrow his government. He even wanted to use the French people's desire for a swift and peaceful solution to the Indochina issue as his life-saving circle, ridiculously "warning" that "to provoke a (government) crisis is to sacrifice the most serious opportunity to seek peace in Indochina. You must consider the consequences of having no government."

This struggle of the Laniel government has received the active support of the United States. The series of speeches recently made by the heads of the US government are obviously intended to give a helping hand from across the Atlantic to the crumbling Laniel government. Dulles, not sooner or later, precisely on the eve of the French parliamentary vote, loudly threatened that the United States would take "decisive" independent action in Indochina "when necessary," regardless of the attitude of the United States' allies. Reuters Washington, June 11, reported that Washington diplomats believe that Dulles' speech was "an attempt to help the Laniel government to counter those influential groups who advocate a peaceful solution at the Geneva Far East Conference..." and attempted to threaten the succeeding French government not to "make drastic changes to the policy toward Indochina."

However, this effort of mutual cooperation between the US ruling group and the French authorities did not produce the expected effect. The French "Liberation" newspaper also wrote on June 10: "Bidault used his skill and determination to defend his policy, but he failed to convince the National Assembly that his policy was in line with the wishes of the National Assembly or the true interests of France."

Now, the work of forming a cabinet in France is underway. People from all walks of life in France demand the establishment of a new government that implements a new policy. However, the French warmongers are still trying their best to obstruct the realization of this wish of the people. The parliamentary group of the Popular Republican Party publicly issued a statement stating that it "will never support a prime minister who tends to change French foreign policy" and clamored for the continued control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Popular Republican Party in order to continue to follow the US war policy. At the same time, the US ruling group also openly continues to exert a strong influence on the French political situation with the rude attitude of habitually interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. US Senator Knowland actually claimed on June 12 that if the new French government changes its current policy, then the puppet regime in Indochina can "immediately declare independence" and become a docile tool for the United States to expand its intervention in the Indochina war. The United States also clamored to use the French political situation to break up the Geneva Conference discussing the Indochina issue. However, news from Geneva shows that the US delegation is very anxious and uneasy because it sees that the French delegation, which is in a period of cabinet crisis, cannot agree to break up the conference. The French people will never allow these conspiracies of the French warmongers and the US ruling group to succeed. The situation reflected in the French parliament shows that the French people firmly demand a change in France's current policy and the implementation of a peaceful foreign policy to promote the success of the Geneva Conference and restore peace in Indochina.

    法国人民的意志不可侮
    吴全
    法国广大阶层人民要求在印度支那迅速实现和平的迫切愿望，在法国国民议会六月十二日对拉尼埃政府进行的信任投票中又一次极其明显地反映出来。信任投票的结果，三百零六票反对，二百九十三票赞成；拉尼埃内阁遭到了失败，因而不得不提出集体辞职。
    自从柏林四国外长会议决定举行日内瓦会议，讨论恢复印度支那和平以后，法国各阶层人民即表示普遍的欢迎，并展开了要求结束印度支那殖民战争的强大运动。这个运动很快就在今年三月举行的国民议会的辩论中反映出来，辩论后通过决议，欢迎日内瓦会议“能结束痛苦的印度支那战争”。但在日内瓦会议举行的期间，拉尼埃政府并没有按照人民意志和民族利益行事，国民议会议员就曾一再要求就印度支那问题进行辩论。拉尼埃却仍坚持继续执行他的外交政策，并居然以政治的讹诈手段来对付议会，要求举行信任投票来抗拒议会的辩论。虽然在最近两次信任投票中，拉尼埃仅以微弱的多数度过了危机，但是他所获得的信任票却减少到了两票多数的地步。当时法国的报纸就曾提出警告说：对于拉尼埃政府，这两票只足够它去谋求和平，而不够它去继续战争。但是拉尼埃显然并没有汲取应有的教训，依然在日内瓦会议上玩弄两面手法，采取继续战争的措施，并热中于与美国进行扩大战争的谈判，使日内瓦会议未能就印度支那问题迅速达成协议。法国主战派的这种做法，不能不引起法国各阶层人民的极度不满，拉尼埃政府也终于无法避免垮台的命运了。
    拉尼埃内阁的垮台，证明法国主战派不顾人民的意志，执行违反法国利益的政策，是行不通的，法国人民的意志和力量是不可侮的。
    这次法国国民议会投的不信任票，虽然不足法定的三百一十四票的绝对多数，但是，拉尼埃还是不得不提出集体辞职，法国总统戈蒂也宣布接受，另组新阁。这说明投票的结果还远不足以反映人们对拉尼埃政府的印度支那政策的不信任的程度。只要举出这一点就够了，在举行信任投票之前，拉尼埃曾要求首先将一个有利于政府的、主张国民议会“对它表示信任”的提案进行表决，但被国民议会以三百二十四票对二百六十九票予以否决了。更重要的事实是，法国各阶层人民争取迅速结束印度支那战争的运动正在日益高涨。各阶层人民团体和组织派遣了数以百计的代表团，每日川流不息地到日内瓦去表达他们的和平愿望，这就清楚不过地说明了这一点。
    人们可以从这次法国国民议会各党派议员的发言中，看到拉尼埃—皮杜尔集团的现行外交政策是多末不得人心。
    一贯主张谋求印度支那问题和平解决的法国共产党（它在国民议会中拥有九十六个议席），在议会辩论中表示了明确的态度。共产党议员雷蒙·葛约指出，现在问题在于：愿意真正地求得印度支那和平呢，还是相反地，要破坏谈判和扩大战争？他谈到皮杜尔所说的“政策的一贯性”时说：这种一贯性“在七年中所带来的只是耻辱、破产、贫困和把民族利益置之脑后”。他说：“今天为法国利益着想，就要寻求一项对双方都是光荣的协定，因为谈判破裂就意味着法国走向新的浩劫。”
    其他各党派的许多议员的发言，也有力地揭露了拉尼埃政府的外交政策的实质。法国激进社会党议员达拉第指责政府对印度支那采取的政策是“错误的和荒谬的”。他抗议把印度支那战争国际化的计划，并要求努力进行谈判。无党派议员路易·伐隆也指出：“法国的政府人物已经断送了法国的独立……政府必须停止执行美国需要的政策。相反地，政府应当执行一个独立的政策，与印度支那人民达成协议。”进步共和联盟议员皮埃尔·麦尼埃抨击政府没有诚意在日内瓦求得印度支那问题的和平解决，他说：“协议是可能的。越南民主共和国的建议就证明了这一点。我们决不能错过今天的机会。”
    这说明了什么呢？最近美国统治集团为了掩盖它企图中断日内瓦会议，把法国和其他盟国拖到扩大印度支那战争中去的阴谋计划，竭力颠倒事实，混淆真相，曲解越南民主共和国、中国和苏联三国代表团争取协议的立场和主张，胡诌什么“苏中态度强硬”使“会议情况恶化”的谰言。但是，法国各党派议员的发言，拉尼埃内阁的垮台，不正是对这些别有用心的谰言的有力的答复吗？
    法国国民议会辩论中所反映的广大公众反对拉尼埃政府现行政策的坚强意志，还表现在：尽管法国主战派和他们的华盛顿靠山，用尽了种种威胁利诱的手段来对待这次议会，但终于未能使拉尼埃政府蒙混过关，维持它的政权，继续在日内瓦会议上执行违背法国人民愿望的政策。
    皮杜尔在议会上的发言中，拚命掩饰日内瓦会议的真实情况，歪曲会议所以进展迟缓的原因，避免法国代表团所应负的责任，而把自己打扮成希望恢复印度支那和平的模样。他欺骗议会说，仿佛拉尼埃政府并没有玩弄两面手法，也没有追随美国的政策，而是“尽一切力量来使谈判成功”，是“为了法国和为了和平”而工作的。拉尼埃更公开威胁议会不要推翻他的政府。他甚至想利用法国人民渴望印度支那问题迅速和平解决的心情来作为自己的救命圈，荒唐地“警告”说，“挑起一次（政府）危机，就是牺牲求得印度支那和平的最严重的机会。你们必须考虑没有政府的后果。”
    拉尼埃政府所进行的这种挣扎，得到了美国的积极支持。最近美国政府首脑们所发表的一连串演说，显然是想从大西洋彼岸为摇摇欲坠的拉尼埃政府助一臂之力。杜勒斯不迟不早，恰恰在法国议会投票前夕，大声恫吓说，美国在“必要时”将对印度支那“断然”采取独立行动，而不问美国的盟国态度如何。路透社华盛顿十一日报道说：华盛顿外交人员认为，杜勒斯的这篇演说，是“企图帮助拉尼埃政府，以对抗那些主张在日内瓦远东会议上……取得和平的解决办法……的有势力集团”，并且企图威胁继任的法国政府，不得“对印度支那的政策作剧烈的改变”。
    然而，美国统治集团和法国当权人物互相配合的这个努力，并没有发生预期的效果。六月十日法国“解放报”也写道：“皮杜尔用手腕和决心来维护他的政策，但是他未能使国民议会相信他的政策是符合国民议会的愿望或符合法国的真正利益的。”
    现在，法国的组阁工作正在进行。法国各阶层人民要求成立执行新的政策的新政府。但法国主战派仍在竭力阻挠实现人民的这个愿望。人民共和党议会党团竟公开发表声明，表示它“决不支持一个倾向于改变法国外交政策的总理”，并扬言要求仍然由人民共和党控制外交部，以便继续追随美国的战争政策。同时美国统治集团也公开地继续以惯于干涉别国内政的粗暴态度对法国政局施行强烈的影响。美国参议员诺兰于六月十二日居然声称，如果法国新政府改变现行政策，那末印度支那的傀儡政权就可以“立即宣布独立”，成为美国扩大干涉印度支那战争的驯服工具。美国并扬言要利用法国政局来破裂讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议。但是，来自日内瓦的消息表明，美国代表团人士看到处在阁潮期间的法国代表团不可能同意破裂会议，因而他们表现十分的焦急和不安。法国人民决不容许法国主战派和美国统治集团的这些阴谋活动得逞。法国议会所反映的情况说明，法国人民坚决要求改变法国的现行政策，而实行和平的外交政策，以促进日内瓦会议的成功，恢复印度支那的和平。
