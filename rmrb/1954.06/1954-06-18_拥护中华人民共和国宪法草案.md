Endorse the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China
Member of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Zheng Zhenduo

    I greet the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee, with infinite joy and excitement.
    This draft constitution fully embodies the spirit of the people being masters of their own house. It is a democratic and also a socialist-type constitution.
    This draft constitution consolidates the fruits of the great victory of the people's revolution, achieved by the Chinese people in more than a hundred years, especially in the last thirty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in their heroic struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    This draft constitution also consolidates the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people in social reform movements and economic recovery work over the past four years. At the same time, it further embodies the common desire of the people of the whole country to build a socialist society, and specifically and clearly stipulates the general task of the country during the transition period: to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.
    In this way, this draft constitution summarizes the revolutionary and construction experiences of the Chinese people and also clearly points out the bright road for the Chinese people to build a socialist society. It is a great masterpiece produced by combining the experience of the socialist revolution with the reality of the Chinese revolution.
    We must be determined to study this draft constitution hard. We literary and art workers should especially use various forms of literature and art to publicize it to the masses of the people.
    Studying and publicizing the draft constitution at the same time is our literary and art workers' primary political task at present. Literary and art workers have particularly keen senses, sharp eyes, and hearts full of passion. To struggle for the bright future of a socialist society is the responsibility of every literary and art worker. Similarly, we fully believe that our literary and art workers will contribute all their strength to the arduous and glorious work of building a socialist society.
    In the history of the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for more than a hundred years, and in the various great social reform movements in the past four years, literary and art workers have done their part, sharing the same pulse, breathing the same air, sharing the same joys and sorrows, and even sharing life and death with all revolutionaries. This proves that our literary and art workers are completely worthy of being outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.
    As a citizen of the People's Republic of China and as a literary and art worker, how excited and encouraged I am! I wholeheartedly support this draft constitution!

    拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席团委员　郑振铎
    我以无限欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接中央人民政府委员会公布的中华人民共和国宪法草案。
    这部宪法草案充分地表现了人民当家作主的精神。它是一部民主的，同时也是一部社会主义类型的宪法。
    这部宪法草案把中国人民在一百多年来，特别是近三十多年来，在中国共产党领导下，与帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义作英勇斗争，而终于取得了人民革命的伟大胜利的果实巩固了下来。
    这部宪法草案也把中国人民四年多来在社会改革运动和经济恢复工作等方面所取得的辉煌成就巩固了下来。同时，它进一步体现了全国人民对于建设社会主义社会的共同愿望，具体而明确的规定了国家在过渡时期的总任务：逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    就是这样，这部宪法草案一方面既总结了中国人民的革命的和建设的经验，同时也明白地指出了中国人民建设社会主义社会的光明大道。它是社会主义革命经验结合了中国革命实际而产生的大杰作。
    我们要下决心，努力学习这部宪法草案。我们文艺工作者们尤应该用各式各样的文艺形式来向人民群众进行宣传。
    学习同时宣传宪法草案，正是我们文艺工作者目前首要的政治任务。文艺工作者的感觉是特别敏锐的，眼光是特别尖利的，心胸里是充满了热情的。为了社会主义社会的光明前途而奋斗，乃是每
  一个文艺工作者的责任。同样，我们完全相信，我们的文艺工作者们是会在建设社会主义社会的艰巨而光荣的工作中贡献出自己的全部力量来的。
    就在一百多年来的反帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争历史上，就在四年多来的种种伟大的社会改革运动里，文艺工作者们尽了应尽的
  一部分力量，是和所有的革命者们同脉搏，同呼吸，同甘苦，甚至同生死的。这证明了：我们的文艺工作者们是完全无愧于作为中华民族的优秀儿女的。
    作为中华人民共和国的一个公民，作为一个文艺工作者，我是多么兴奋，多么欢欣鼓舞！我以全心拥护这部宪法草案！
