The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement on the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, expressing warm support on behalf of the national industrial and commercial circles for the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The statement said: The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, based on the actual conditions of our country's transition period, stipulates the protection of all existing forms of ownership in our country, and points out that capitalist industry and commerce will gradually replace capitalist ownership with socialist ownership through the path of state capitalism, clearly affirming that building a socialist society is the statutory goal of our country. This makes the industrial and commercial circles more clearly aware of their position and direction of effort. The statement then called on the national industrial and commercial circles to actively participate in the discussion of the Draft Constitution, and put forward opinions on the Draft Constitution; at the same time, through discussion, further enhance understanding, and greet the formal promulgation of our country's Constitution with practical actions of striving for production and operation, obeying the management of the people's government, accepting the leadership of the state-owned economy and the supervision of the workers, and actively realizing socialist transformation.
