Chengdu is preparing to build a "Du Fu Memorial Hall"

    The Chengdu Municipal People's Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau is preparing to establish a "Du Fu Memorial Hall" at the thatched cottage (草堂寺, Caotang Temple) of Du Fu, a poet of the Tang Dynasty. Caotang Temple is located on the banks of Huanhua Creek in the western suburbs of Chengdu. In the late 759 AD, Du Fu came to Sichuan from Shaanxi and built his thatched cottage here, writing many famous poems.

    The Chengdu Municipal People's Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau will send personnel to the poet's hometown, the place of his death, and the places he once roamed to collect relevant cultural relics for the "Du Fu Memorial Hall." These cultural relics include: various editions of Du Fu's poems from different eras, legends about Du Fu, and physical objects or pictures, rubbings, and copies of ancestral halls, statues, inscriptions, and biographies of Du Fu built by later generations to commemorate him. In addition, works and cultural relics of poets Li Bai and Gao Shi, who were contemporaries of Du Fu and had close friendships with him, as well as Song Dynasty poets Huang Tingjian and Lu You, who highly praised Du Fu's poems, will also be collected. Inside the memorial hall, a large number of trees such as pine, nanmu, catalpa, and bamboo, which the poet praised during his lifetime, will also be planted. (Xinhua News Agency)

    成都筹建“杜甫纪念馆”
    成都市人民政府文化事业管理局正在我国唐代诗人杜甫的故居——草堂寺筹建“杜甫纪念馆”。草堂寺在成都市西郊浣花溪畔。公元七五九年末杜甫由陕西到四川后曾在此营建草堂，写出许多著名的诗篇。
    成都市人民政府文化事业管理局将派专人到诗人的故乡、逝世的地方和诗人曾漫游过的地方为“杜甫纪念馆”搜集有关文物。这些文物包括：不同时代的各种杜诗版本，有关杜甫的传说和后人纪念杜甫的祠宇、造塑、碑铭、传记的实物或图片、拓片、抄本等。此外，并将搜集和杜甫同时代且有亲密友谊的诗人李白、高适以及极力推崇杜诗的宋代诗人黄庭坚、陆游等的作品及文物。在纪念馆内，还将大量栽培诗人生前曾歌颂过的松、楠、桤、竹等树木。　（新华社）
