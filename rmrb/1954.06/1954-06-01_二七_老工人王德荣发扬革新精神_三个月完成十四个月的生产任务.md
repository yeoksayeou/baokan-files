"February 7th" Old Worker Wang Derong Promotes Innovative Spirit
Completes Fourteen Months of Production Task in Three Months
[Our Newspaper] Wang Derong, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" struggle, completed a production task equivalent to one year and two months in February, March, and April of this year.
Wang Derong is a planer at the turnout factory of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's engineering workshop. Starting in February this year, Wang Derong successively accepted the task assigned by the group to plane 11,520 flat fishplates. According to his existing target—a quota of fifteen minutes per piece—this task would require 360 working days, approximately one year and two months to complete. Wang Derong said: "Although I am already over fifty years old this year, I want to dedicate all my strength to the country and to the cause of socialism." He carefully studied the time spent on each process: "Now we are using one side of the planer for production. If we can find a way to make the other side of the planer work equally well, and find a way to shorten the time for each process, we can plane one more bed per day and increase production." Later, he and the workers in the group studied the issue, fully estimated the cutting capacity of the planer, and installed three tool holders on the other side of the planer, doubling the output. While working, he carefully pondered the problem and gradually reduced the time to plane one bed of flat fishplates (84 pieces) from more than one day to only three hours.
Although it only takes three hours to produce one bed of products, it was still not possible to plane three beds a day. Therefore, he proposed at the group meeting to strengthen joint labor among the planers. This suggestion was immediately supported by young planers Dong Nianxiang, Zheng Zhiliang, Chen Guorong, and others, who all agreed to help Wang Derong assemble and disassemble screws, tool holders, and products; Wang Derong would help them watch the planer during this time. This further shortened the planing time by more than twenty minutes. Starting in March, Wang Derong's planer created a new record of planing three beds a day, producing 252 flat fishplates, and increasing work efficiency by more than six times. By the end of April, he had completed all his tasks ahead of schedule.

    “二七”老工人王德荣发扬革新精神
    三个月完成十四个月的生产任务
    【本报讯】曾参加“二七”斗争的老工人王德荣，在今年二、三、四三个月内，完成了一年零两个月的生产任务。
    王德荣是上海铁路局工务修配所道岔工厂刨工。今年二月份起，王德荣陆续接受了小组分配给他的刨削一万一千五百二十块平直夹板任务。按照他已达到的指标——每块工时定额十五分计算，这批任务须要三百六十个工作日，约一年零两个月完成。王德荣说：“我今年虽然已有五十多岁，但我要把全部力量贡献给国家，贡献给社会主义事业。”他细心研究了每一工序所耗费的时间：“现在是用刨床的一边生产，如果想法使刨床另一边也起同样作用，再想法使每一工序都缩短些时间，每天多刨一床，就可以增加更多的产品了。”后来，他和组内工人研究，充分估计了刨床的吃刀能力，在刨床另一边安装了三付刀架子，产品多出了一倍。他一边工作，一边又细心琢磨，逐渐把出一刨床平直夹板（八十四块）的时间，由一天多缩短到只要三个钟点。
    虽然每生产一刨床产品，只要三个钟头了，但一天还不能刨到三床。于是，他就在小组会议上提出在刨工之间加强联合劳动。这一意见，立刻得到青年刨工董年祥、郑志良、陈国荣等的热情支持，他们都答应帮助王德荣装拆螺丝、刀架、产品；王德荣就在这一时间帮他们看刨床。这样一来，刨削时间又缩短了二十多分钟。三月份起，王德荣这台刨床，就创造了每天刨三床、生产二百五十二块平直夹板的新纪录，工作效率提高了六倍多。四月底，他就提前完成了全部任务。
