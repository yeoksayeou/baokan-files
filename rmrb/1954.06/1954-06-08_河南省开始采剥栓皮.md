Henan Province Begins Harvesting Cork Bark

    Henan Province is currently harvesting cork bark. Before harvesting, various regions convened cork bark production meetings to disseminate cork bark harvesting techniques and formulate cork bark harvesting plans.

    Last March, the Forestry Bureau of the Henan Provincial People's Government, acting on instructions from the Central People's Government, specifically organized a cork bark survey team to conduct a preliminary survey of the province's cork bark resources. Statistics from just over ten counties, including Xinyang, Luoshan, Luanchuan, Songxian, Neixiang, Lushi, and Xixia, indicate that cork bark reserves reach tens of millions of catties. To assess its quality, in January of this year, Soviet cork experts personally visited the Xinyang mountain area to observe the quality of the local cork bark and the growth of trees after bark removal, and offered many suggestions for improvement in harvesting techniques.

    Cork bark is the bark of the cork oak and is the main raw material for manufacturing cork. It is fine and light, elastic, and has special properties such as non-heat conduction, non-electricity conduction, air impermeability, friction resistance, pressure resistance, durability, fire resistance, acid resistance, sound insulation, shock resistance, and non-extensibility, so it has a wide range of industrial uses.

    河南省开始采剥栓皮
    河南省目前正在采剥栓皮。各地在采剥栓皮前，都曾召开栓皮生产会议，传播采剥栓皮技术，拟定采剥栓皮计划。
    去年三月河南省人民政府林业局根据中央人民政府的指示，专门组织了栓皮调查队，对该省栓皮资源作了初步调查，仅据信阳、罗山、栾川、嵩县、内乡、卢氏、西峡等十余县的统计，栓皮蕴藏量即达数千万斤。为了鉴定其质量，今年一月间，苏联软木专家又亲赴信阳山区，对该地栓皮质量和剥皮后树木生长情况作了观察，并在采剥技术上提出了很多改进意见。
    栓皮就是栓皮栎的树皮，是制造软木的主要原料。它质细而轻软，富有弹性，还有不传热、不传电、不透气、耐摩擦、耐压力、耐久、耐火、抗酸、隔音、防震、无延展等特殊性能，因此在工业上用途很广。
