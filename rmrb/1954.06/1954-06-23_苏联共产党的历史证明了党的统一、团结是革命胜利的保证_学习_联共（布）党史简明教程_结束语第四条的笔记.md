The great revolutionary teachers and leaders Lenin and Stalin often taught us to protect the unity and solidarity of the Party as we protect the apple of our eye, because the unity and solidarity of the Party is the foundation of the Party's invincible strength and the basic guarantee for the victory of the revolutionary cause.

The unity and solidarity of the Party are built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of correct political and organizational principles. It is the law of development of a Marxist party to overcome principled differences within the Party through struggle to achieve unity, solidarity, and development. If it is believed that principled differences within the Party can be resolved by means of reconciliation and concealment rather than struggle, then it will inevitably become an agent of the bourgeoisie in the workers' movement and a pillar of imperialism, like all social democratic parties of the Second International.

Ideological differences within the Party are not someone's fabrication, but are related to social class conditions. The contradictions and differences within the Communist Party stem from two situations: one situation is the pressure of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois ideology on the proletariat and its political party under the conditions of proletarian struggle. This pressure often causes the most unyielding strata of the working class and the most unyielding members of the proletarian political party to succumb; the other situation is the impure composition of the working class. The proletariat is composed of three strata: the "purebred" proletariat, those who have recently separated from the petty bourgeoisie and joined the ranks of the proletariat, and the labor aristocracy. Among them, the "purebred" proletariat is the most reliable pillar of Marxism, while the latter two strata are fertile ground for cultivating general opportunism. When the sentiments of the labor aristocracy prevail, open opportunism arises, while when the sentiments of the semi-petty bourgeois strata of the working class who have not completely broken with the petty bourgeoisie prevail, opportunism arises disguised by "leftist" slogans.

The historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union tells us: "A working-class party cannot preserve the unity and discipline of its ranks, cannot fulfill its mission as the organizer and leader of the proletarian revolution, and cannot fulfill its mission as the builder of a new socialist society, if it does not wage an irreconcilable struggle against the opportunists in its ranks, if it does not crush the capitulationists in its ranks." [1] The history of the CPSU is a history of struggling against and eliminating various opportunist factions, and thus a history of constantly gaining consolidation and development in the struggle with them, thereby guaranteeing the continuous victory of the revolutionary cause.

Before the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the struggle against opportunism was to establish a new type of party, to defend and consolidate this new type of party. The basic task of the proletariat at that time was to seize power. In order to seize power, there must be a party with ideological consistency, organizational unity, which can organize the broad masses of the proletariat and revolutionary peasants into a strong political army and lead them to seize power by taking advantage of the revolutionary high tide. Otherwise, the victory of the revolution is impossible. From the beginning of his revolutionary activities, Lenin waged a principled struggle to establish such a political party. Lenin crushed the opportunist lines of the Economists and Mensheviks in ideology, organization, and tactics, and at the Prague Party Conference in 1912, formed the independent Bolshevik Party. This was a new type of party with an essential difference from the social democratic parties of various countries in the Second International. It adopted an attitude of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship towards the bourgeoisie, and an irreconcilable attitude towards opportunism. It had iron discipline that must be observed by every party member, thereby ensuring its strong unity and organizational unity. It was precisely under the leadership of such a party that the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution of 1917 was guaranteed.

After seizing power, the Party was the tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leading and guiding force of Soviet society. The basic tasks facing the Party were to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and to build socialism. This was a more arduous and complex task than seizing power, because the forces of the overthrown class enemies were still very strong, and the encirclement of imperialism always threatened the life of the Soviet regime, while Russia at that time was an economically backward country. This made the issue of the Party's unity and solidarity particularly important. Stalin once pointed out: "When other countries are still ruled by imperialism, when one country—only one country—can break through the battle line of capital, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot exist for a minute under such conditions without the unity of the Party armed with iron discipline." [2] Therefore, after the proletariat seized power, the struggle against opportunism within the Party was a necessary condition for defending and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and building socialism.

During this period, the Party was filled with the most complex and acute struggles. The struggle against opportunism within the Party was also a struggle that determined the success or failure of the revolutionary cause and determined whether socialism could be built in one country. At the same time, this struggle was made more complex and intense by the collusion of imperialism and counter-revolutionaries with degenerate elements within the Party, and the internal Party struggle took on the nature of a part of the external Party struggle.

The victory of socialism on one-sixth of the earth's surface caused shock and hatred among imperialists, and they colluded with the counter-revolutionaries of the Russian reactionary classes who had been overthrown, trying every means to sabotage, attempting to eliminate the Soviet regime and restore capitalism. When they failed time and time again, they adopted more despicable and vicious means to carry out their conspiracies. One of the most important was to create divisions within the Communist Party and look for agents from within the Communist Party in order to seize the fortress from within. They also found Trotsky, Bukharin, Kamenev, Zinoviev, and even the like of Beria within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. These shameful careerists and enemies of the people turned out to be the running dogs of the fascist intelligence agencies, becoming spies, assassins, murderers, military saboteurs, and traitors. They began their anti-Party and anti-people criminal activities very early on.

In the most difficult period after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Trotsky gang took advantage of the "leftist" sentiments of some petty bourgeois elements at that time, used "leftist" slogans to sabotage the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and colluded with the Social Revolutionaries to plot the arrest and murder of Lenin, Stalin, and Sverdlov; in the summer of 1918, they used despicable means to stab Lenin, the leader most respected by the working people of the world; during the period of imperialist armed intervention and civil war, these shameful enemies of the people used various means to assist foreign armed intervention, attempting to make the Red Army fail, split the Soviet Union, eliminate the Soviet regime, and restore the capitalist enslavement system.

After the end of the foreign armed intervention, due to years of war, industry and agriculture were severely damaged, and the Soviet regime was in an extremely difficult situation. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union at that time had to replace the surplus grain requisition system with a grain tax in order to first restore agriculture, create conditions for the restoration and development of industry, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on this economic relationship. However, at this turning point, the Trotsky gang deliberately deepened and sharpened the then existing differences of opinion within the Party, attempting to split the working class, undermine the worker-peasant alliance, and shake the Party and overthrow Lenin's leadership from within. Subsequently, they took advantage of Lenin's illness and death and the economic tension caused by their own implementation of price policies that violated Soviet principles to attack the Party, attempting to replace Leninism with Trotskyism, which believed that socialism could not be victorious in one country, and attempted to overthrow the Party's leadership headed by Stalin.

When the recovery period ended, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, in order to build socialism, had to start with heavy industry and implement national industrialization in order to create the basic conditions for building socialism. At this time, the anti-Party group headed by Zinoviev and Kamenev put forward the traitorous "plan" that the Soviet Union should still be an agricultural country to oppose the Party Central Committee's socialist industrialization plan and carried out serious anti-Party activities. When the entire Party and the entire working class were waging a tenacious struggle for national industrialization and making the industrialization cause move forward smoothly, the Trotsky and Zinoviev gang stepped up their anti-Party activities in coordination with the imperialist provocations against the Soviet Union, attempting to sabotage the progress of the industrialization cause.

When the Communist Party of the Soviet Union launched an offensive against the rich peasants in order to realize agricultural collectivization and establish a foundation for socialism in the countryside, the Bukharin and Rykov anti-Party group, who originally wanted to place their hope of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union on the rich peasant class, rose up to openly oppose the Party's policy. They said that the rich peasants could peacefully grow into socialism, creating an absurd "theory of the extinction of class struggle," thereby paralyzing the working class and opposing the Party.

All the criminal activities of the Trotsky, Zinoviev, Bukharin, and Rykov gangs were intensified in the most tense situations of class struggle. They gathered all the unstable elements within the Party, adopted the most despicable means, and took advantage of every gap to undermine the Party's unity. They put forward countless anti-Party "programs," regardless of whether these "programs" were concealed by "leftist" slogans or openly put forward in a rightist way, all of which were ultimately aimed at destroying the Party from within, undermining the Soviet regime, and restoring capitalism.

"A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" pointed out: "The Party is the leading force of the working class, the advanced fortress of the working class, and the combat headquarters of the working class. In the leading headquarters of the working class, it is absolutely not allowed for those who lack faith, opportunists, capitulationists, and traitors to stand. To engage in a life-and-death struggle with the bourgeoisie while leaving capitulationists and traitors in one's own headquarters and in one's own fortress will put one in a position of being attacked from both the front and the rear. Such a struggle will obviously only end in failure. The fortress is most easily breached from within." [3] Therefore, socialism could not be built in this period without defeating the Trotskyites and Bukharinites.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to and unfolded the struggle against various anti-Party groups. At all critical junctures and on key issues, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has exposed and defeated all anti-Party conspiracy groups with firm and correct principles. The Party educated and united the entire Party and the entire working class with the firm belief that the socialist revolution can be victorious in one country and that socialism can be built in one country, and with a correct and specific program for building socialism. The Party became more united and consolidated in the struggle with various anti-Party groups, and the prestige of the Party Central Committee was further enhanced, which guaranteed the smooth progress of socialist construction beyond the planned schedule.

However, it would be extremely naive to think that the greater the success achieved in socialist construction, the more the class enemies will weaken their resistance, to the point of surrendering. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that the closer the class struggle gets to the end, the more acute it becomes, and the more the class enemies lose their foothold, the more they intensify their resistance. The history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union fully proves this principle. When the anti-Party activities and absurd propositions of the Trotsky and Bukharin gangs, the agents of imperialism within the Party, were shattered by the facts of the victory of the Party and socialist construction, they adopted the means of political double-dealing. They superficially praised the Party's achievements and excessively blamed their own mistakes in order to hide within the Party. Secretly, they were engaged in plots to assassinate revolutionary leaders. The assassination of Comrade Kirov, the most respected of the entire Party and the working class, in December 1934 was the first step in this extreme means. In the years of interrogation after this incident, it was completely ascertained that the enemies of the people, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, Rykov, and their accomplices, had colluded to conspire against Lenin, against the Party, and against the Soviet state from the earliest days of the October Revolution. All these criminal acts of the bandits were carried out in accordance with the instructions of foreign bourgeois intelligence agencies.

The basic lesson that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union learned from the tragic event of Kirov's assassination was to eliminate political paralysis and raise the revolutionary vigilance of all Party members. The Party Central Committee pointed out in its letter to all Party organizations at all levels on the Kirov assassination: "Bolsheviks should not be complacent and careless. What we need is not harmony, but vigilance, true Bolshevik revolutionary vigilance."

In his report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) in March 1937, Stalin once again emphasized the importance of political vigilance, exposed the roots and harms of political paralysis, and pointed out ways to overcome them. He pointed out that the reason why bandits such as Trotsky were able to lurk within the Party for a long time and carry out their sabotage activities was because we Bolsheviks in the past were intoxicated with economic victories and ignored the capitalist encirclement, and therefore underestimated the importance of strengthening the Party's political work and the struggle against assassination plots. He said: "The dark side produced by economic victories is manifested in complacency, carelessness, and dull political sense," "To be too intoxicated with economic work and economic victories and to underestimate and forget the Party's political issues will lead to a dead end." He emphasized that as long as the capitalist encirclement exists, foreign intelligence agencies will send assassins, military saboteurs, spies, and murderers to the rear of the Soviet Union.

The exposure and punishment of the Trotsky and Bukharin gangs by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1937 was of great significance, as it brought the Party to an unprecedented level of unity, thereby guaranteeing the victory of the Great Patriotic War. At the same time, the experience of discovering and exposing the Trotsky and Bukharin gangs also helps fraternal parties in various countries to discover and eliminate the agents and spies of imperialism within the Party in a timely manner, so as to consolidate the Party and thus ensure the smooth development of the revolutionary cause of their countries.

Of course, it would be equally naive to think that because the Trotsky and Bukharin gangs have been eliminated, there will be no more agents of imperialism within the Party. The Beria anti-Party group, an agent of imperialism, exposed by the CPSU last year, is a vivid example. The Beria anti-Party group was more despicable and filthy than any anti-Party conspiracy group in history. They deceived the Party's trust and lurked within the Party for a long time. After Stalin's death, when the anti-Soviet activities of the imperialists became rampant, they began their most despicable and insidious activities. The timely exposure and punishment of this conspiratorial anti-Party group by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union proved the unity of the CPSU and its high level of vigilance. However, it also once again reminded us that we must raise our political vigilance at all times and in all places, and maintain the Party's unity and solidarity under collective leadership.

After clearing out the Beria conspiratorial anti-Party group, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made the entire Party and the entire people more united and, under the banner of Lenin and Stalin and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Malenkov, advanced victoriously along the road of communism with full confidence.

Our Chinese Communist Party was established in accordance with Lenin's principles of Party building. Our Party has gone through various sacrifices and struggles, forming a unified leadership headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the unity of the entire Party. This unity has been strengthened and consolidated in the struggle against various erroneous tendencies within the Party, finally making the Party an invincible force. It is precisely because of the correct leadership of our Party that the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution was guaranteed.

Now, our Party is leading the people of the whole country to struggle for the realization of the Party's general line in the transition period. Due to our country's economic backwardness and the complexity of the domestic and international environment, this task is very arduous. Throughout the entire transition period, it contains extremely complex and extremely acute struggles. This requires our Party to be further united and consolidated. This February, our Party Central Committee held the Fourth Plenary Session. At this meeting, the historically significant "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" was adopted. This resolution is wise and timely. It accepts the historical lessons of the CPSU and fraternal parties in various countries, combines them with the practical experience of the Chinese Communist Party, and makes creative and specific provisions on how to strengthen Party unity. It will awaken the sense of responsibility of all Party members, cadres, especially senior cadres, for the revolutionary cause, the vigilance against the enemy's conspiracies, and the vigilance against individualistic careerists who may appear within the Party. It will ensure and further enhance the unity of our Party. This resolution is a heavy blow to imperialism and reactionaries. Party unity is the fundamental guarantee for the smooth realization of the general line in the transition period. Our task is to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, lead the people of the whole country, and strive to overcome any conspiracies and sabotage by domestic and foreign enemies, and to guarantee the victory of the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    苏联共产党的历史证明了党的统一、团结是革命胜利的保证
    ——学习“联共（布）党史简明教程”结束语第四条的笔记
    校纪英
    伟大的革命导师和领袖列宁、斯大林经常教导我们，要像保护眼珠一样地保护党的统一和团结，因为党的统一和团结就是党不可战胜的力量的基础，是革命事业取得胜利的基本保证。
    党的统一和团结是建立在马克思列宁主义基础上，建立在正确的政治原则和组织原则基础上的。以斗争来克服党内的原则分歧而达到统一、团结和发展，是马克思主义政党的发展规律。如果认为党内的原则分歧可以不用斗争的方法而用调和与掩饰的方法来解决，那就必然会像第二国际的一切社会民主党一样，成为资产阶级在工人运动中的代办，成为帝国主义的支柱。
    党内的意见分歧，并不是什么人的臆造，而是与社会阶级条件相联系的。共产党内部的矛盾和分歧根源于两种情况：一种情况是在无产阶级斗争条件下，资产阶级和资产阶级思想对无产阶级及其政党的压力，这种压力常常使工人阶级中的最不坚定的阶层，无产阶级政党中的最不坚定的分子屈服；另一种情况是工人阶级成分不纯。无产阶级是由三个阶层组成的，即“纯血统的”无产阶级，不久以前才从小资产阶级分化出来，参加到无产阶级队伍者，工人贵族。其中“纯血统的”无产阶级是马克思主义最可靠的柱石，后两个阶层则是培养一般机会主义的园地。在工人贵族的情绪占上风时，就产生公开的机会主义，而在和小资产阶级还没有完全断绝关系的工人阶级半小市民阶层的情绪占上风时，就产生以“左”的词句掩盖着的机会主义。
    苏联共产党的历史经验告诉我们：“工人阶级政党不与自己队伍中的机会主义者作不调和的斗争，不把自己队伍中的投降主义者粉碎，就不能保存自己队伍的统一和纪律，就不能实现其为无产阶级革命底组织者和领导者的使命，就不能实现其为社会主义新社会的建设者的使命。”〔一〕苏共底历史，就是与各种机会主义派别进行斗争并把它们清除出去的历史，也就是在与它们斗争中不断获得巩固和发展因而保证革命事业节节胜利的历史。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命胜利以前，反对机会主义的斗争，是为了建立新型的党，是为了捍卫并巩固这个新型的党。无产阶级在当时的基本任务便是夺取政权，为了夺取政权，就必须有一个思想一致，组织统一，能把无产阶级广大群众及革命农民组成为一支强大的政治军队并领导他们利用革命高潮夺取政权的党。不然，革命的胜利是不可能的。列宁开始进行革命活动时起，就为建立这样的政党而进行了原则的斗争。列宁粉碎了经济派和孟什维克在思想上、组织上和策略上的机会主义路线，在一九一二年普拉加党代表会议上，形成了独立的布尔什维克党。这是与第二国际各国社会民主党有着本质区别的新型政党，它对资产阶级采取无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的态度，对机会主义采取不调和的态度，它有着为每个党员所必须遵守的铁的纪律，因而确保了它的坚强团结和组织统一。正是这样党的领导，才保证了一九一七年伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利。
    在夺取政权后，党便是无产阶级专政的工具，是苏维埃社会的领导和指导力量。党所面临的基本任务，便是捍卫并巩固无产阶级专政和建设社会主义，这是比夺取政权还艰巨复杂得多的任务，因为被推翻了的阶级敌人势力还很强大，同时帝国主义的包围随时都威胁着苏维埃政权的生命，而俄国当时又是一个经济落后的国家。这就使党的统一和团结问题显得特别重要。斯大林曾指出：“当其他各国还被帝国主义统治着的时候，当一个国家——仅仅一个国家——能够冲破了资本底战线的时候，无产阶级专政在这种条件下如果没有以铁的纪律为武装的党底统一，那是一分钟都不能存在的。”〔二〕所以，在无产阶级夺取政权以后，党内反机会主义的斗争，便是捍卫并巩固无产阶级专政和建设社会主义的必要条件。
    在这一时期，党内充满了最复杂最尖锐的斗争。党内反机会主义的斗争，也就是决定革命事业胜败的斗争，决定社会主义能否在一国建成的斗争。同时，这种斗争又由于帝国主义和反革命分子与党内蜕化变节分子相勾结，使党内斗争更复杂更激烈，并且使党内斗争会带着一部分党外斗争的性质。
    社会主义在地球六分之一地面上的胜利，引起了帝国主义的震惊和痛恨，它们便和俄国已被推翻了的反动阶级的反革命分子勾结起来，想尽办法进行破坏，企图消灭苏维埃政权，复辟资本主义。当他们一次又一次失败以后，他们便采取更加卑鄙和毒辣的手段进行其阴谋活动。其中最重要的一个，便是制造共产党内部的分裂，从共产党内部寻找代理人，以便从内部夺取堡垒。他们在苏联共产党内部也找到了托洛茨基、布哈林、加米涅夫、季诺维也夫直到贝利亚之流。这些可耻的野心家和人民公敌，结果变成了法西斯侦探机关的走狗，变成了间谍、暗害者、杀人凶手、军事破坏者和卖国贼。他们很早就开始了反党反人民的罪恶活动。
    在十月社会主义革命胜利后的最困难的时期，托洛茨基匪帮利用当时一部分小资产阶级的“左”倾情绪，以“左”的词句破坏布列斯特和约的签订，并勾结社会革命党人图谋逮捕并杀害列宁、斯大林和斯维尔德洛夫；他们在一九一八年夏以卑劣的手段刺伤了全世界劳动人民所最敬爱的领袖列宁；在帝国主义进行武装干涉和国内战争时期，这些可耻的人民公敌又以各种手段协助外国武装干涉，企图使红军失败，分裂苏联，消灭苏维埃政权和恢复资本主义奴役制度。
    在外国武装干涉结束后，由于多年战争，工农业遭到严重破坏，因而苏维埃政权处于极端困难的情况。苏联共产党当时必须用粮食税代替余粮收集制，以便首先恢复农业，为工业的恢复与发展创造条件，并在这一经济关系上巩固工农联盟。但是，托洛茨基匪帮在这一转变关头却故意加深当时党内意见分歧，并使其尖锐化起来，企图分裂工人阶级，破坏工农联盟，从内部来动摇党并推翻列宁的领导。接着，他们利用列宁卧病和逝世以及在他们自己执行违反苏维埃的价格政策而造成的经济紧张情况，向党进攻，企图以认为社会主义不能在一国胜利的托洛茨基主义代替列宁主义，并试图推翻以斯大林为首的党的领导。
    当恢复时期结束，苏联共产党为了建设社会主义，必须从重工业着手实行国家工业化，以创造建设社会主义的基本条件。这时以季诺维也夫和加米涅夫为首组成的反党集团，提出了苏联仍应为农业国的叛逆“计划”，来反对党中央的社会主义工业化计划，并进行了严重的反党活动。当全党和全体工人阶级正为国家工业化进行着顽强的斗争并使工业化的事业顺利向前推进时，托洛茨基、季诺维也夫匪帮就配合帝国主义加紧对苏联的挑衅行为，加强了反党活动，企图破坏工业化事业的进行。
    在苏联共产党为实现农业集体化，为社会主义在农村建立基础而向富农开展进攻时，原想把在苏联复辟资本主义的希望寄托在富农阶级身上的布哈林、李可夫反党集团，便起而公开反对党的政策。他们说富农可以和平长入社会主义，制造了一种荒谬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”，以此麻痹工人阶级和反对党。
    所有托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、布哈林、李可夫匪帮的这一切罪恶活动，总是在阶级斗争最紧张的情况下加紧进行的。他们收罗了党内一切不稳定的分子，采取了各种最卑劣的手段，利用每一个空隙，来破坏党的团结。他们提出了无数反党的“政纲”，不管这些“政纲”是以“左”的词句来掩盖，或是公开以右的方式提出，归结起来都是为了从内部来毁灭党，破坏苏维埃政权，复辟资本主义。
    “联共（布）党史”指出：“党是工人阶级底领导部队，工人阶级底先头堡垒，工人阶级底战斗司令部。在工人阶级底领导司令部中，决不能容许有缺乏信念者，机会主义者，投降主义者和叛徒立足。在自己的司令部中，在自己的堡垒中留有投降主义者和叛徒而要去同资产阶级作殊死斗争，就会陷于腹背受击的地位。这样的斗争分明只会遭到失败的结局。堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。”〔三〕所以，在这一时期内如果不击破托洛茨基分子和布哈林分子，便不能进行社会主义建设。
    苏联共产党一贯坚持了和展开了反对各种反党集团的斗争。在一切紧要关头和关键问题上，苏联共产党都以坚定而正确的原则，揭露和击破了一切反党的阴谋集团。党用社会主义革命可以在一国胜利和在一国内可以建成社会主义的坚强信念，用正确而具体的建设社会主义的纲领，教育了团结了全党和全体工人阶级。党在与各种反党集团作斗争中更加团结更加巩固了，党中央的威信更加提高了，这也就保证了社会主义建设超过预定计划地顺利进行。
    但是，如果认为由于社会主义建设取得的成功越大，阶级敌人就越会减弱他的反抗，以至于俯首就降，这便是极端幼稚的想法。马克思列宁主义教导我们，阶级斗争越到最后越尖锐，阶级敌人愈是失去其立足基地则其反抗也就愈是加紧。苏联共产党的历史充分地证明了这一原理。帝国主义在党内的代理人，托洛茨基、布哈林匪帮的反党活动和荒谬主张，被党和社会主义建设的胜利的事实所粉碎时，便采取了政治上两面派的手段。他们表面上过分地颂赞党的成绩和过分地责备自己的错误以便藏身党内。他们暗地里却干着谋刺革命领袖的勾当。一九三四年十二月全党和工人阶级最敬爱的基洛夫同志的被刺，便是他们这种极端手段的第一步。在这一事件发生后的几年侦讯中，完全查明了人民公敌托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、加米涅夫、布哈林、李可夫及其同伙们，从十月革命最初几天起，就勾结起来阴谋反对列宁，反对党，反对苏维埃国家。匪徒们的这一切罪恶行为，都是遵照着外国资产阶级侦探机关的指令进行的。
    苏联共产党从基洛夫被刺这一惨痛事件中所得的基本教训，就是要消灭政治上的麻痹和提高全体党员的革命警惕性。党中央因基洛夫被刺事件告全党各级组织的信上指出：“布尔什维克不应当高枕无忧和马马虎虎。我们所需要的不是一团和气，而是警惕性、真正的布尔什维克的革命警惕性。”
    斯大林在一九三七年三月联共（布）中央全会上的报告中，再一次强调了政治警觉性的重要意义，揭露了政治上麻痹的根源和危害性，并指出了克服的办法。他指出，托洛茨基等匪徒之所以能长期潜伏党内，进行其破坏活动，是由于我们布尔什维克过去迷醉于经济上的胜利而忽略了资本主义包围，因而轻视了加强党的政治工作以及与暗害勾当作斗争的重要性。他说：“因经济胜利而产生的阴暗方面，表现在自满自足、漫不经心、政治嗅觉迟钝上面”，“过分迷醉于经济工作和经济胜利而过低估计和忘记党的政治问题，就会陷入绝境。”他强调指出，只要有资本主义包围存在，外国侦探机关就会派遣暗害者、军事破坏者、间谍、杀人凶手到苏联的后方来。
    苏联共产党在一九三七年，对托洛茨基、布哈林匪帮的揭露和惩办，有着巨大的意义，它使党达到了空前的团结一致，因而保证了伟大卫国战争的胜利。同时，发现和揭露托洛茨基、布哈林匪帮的这一经验，也有助于各国兄弟党及时发觉和清除党内帝国主义的代理人和间谍分子，以巩固党，因而也就保证了他们国家的革命事业的顺利开展。
    当然，如果认为由于托洛茨基、布哈林匪帮的被清除，党内再不会有帝国主义的代理人出现，这同样是极端幼稚的想法。苏共在去年所揭露的帝国主义的代理人贝利亚反党集团就是一个鲜明的例证。贝利亚反党集团，是比历史上任何一个反党的阴谋集团都更卑鄙龌龊。他们骗取了党的信任，长期潜伏在党内。在斯大林逝世以后，帝国主义者的反苏活动猖獗起来的时候，他们开始了其最卑鄙阴险的活动。苏联共产党对这一阴谋反党集团的及时揭露与惩办，证明了苏共的团结一致和它的高度警惕性。但是，也再一次提醒了我们必须随时随地提高政治警惕性，并在集体领导下保持党的团结和统一。
    苏联共产党，在清除了贝利亚阴谋反党集团后，使全党和全国人民更加团结一致，在列宁斯大林的旗帜下、在以马林科夫同志为首的党中央领导下，满怀信心地沿着共产主义大道胜利前进。
    我们中国共产党，是根据列宁的建党原则建立起来的。我们的党，曾经历了种种牺牲奋斗，形成了以毛泽东同志为首的统一领导和全党的团结一致，这种团结一致在与党内各种错误倾向斗争中日益加强和巩固，终于使党成为一个不可战胜的力量。正是由于我们党的正确领导，才保证了中国人民革命的伟大胜利。
    现在，我们党正领导着全国人民，为实现党在过渡时期的总路线而斗争。由于我国经济上的落后和国内外环境的复杂，这一任务是十分艰巨的，在整个过渡时期内，都包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。这就要求我们党更进一步的团结和巩固。今年二月，我们党中央举行了四中全会。在这次会议上通过了具有历史意义的“关于增强党的团结的决议”。这个决议是英明的和适时的。它接受苏共和各国兄弟党的历史教训，结合中国共产党的实践经验，对如何增强党的团结作了创造性的具体规定。它将唤起全体党员、干部特别是高级干部对于革命事业的责任心，对敌人阴谋的警惕性，对于党内可能出现的个人主义野心家的警惕，它将确保和进一步增强我们党的团结。这个决议是对帝国主义和反动派的沉重打击。党的团结是顺利实现过渡时期总路线的根本保证。我们的任务是更紧密地团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，领导全国人民，为战胜国内外敌人的任何阴谋破坏，为保证社会主义建设与社会主义改造的伟大事业胜利而奋斗。
