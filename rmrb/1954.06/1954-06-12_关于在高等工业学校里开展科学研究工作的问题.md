On the Issue of Conducting Scientific Research Work in Higher Industrial Schools
Li Guohao, Dean of Academic Affairs, Tongji University

Higher industrial schools bear a dual mission: on the one hand, to cultivate qualified talents for the country's socialist construction; on the other hand, to solve engineering theory and technology problems for the country's socialist construction and to improve the level of engineering theory and technology. To successfully complete these two tasks, teachers must master the latest scientific achievements in their courses, possess high theoretical attainments, and continuously improve themselves. This requires teachers to conduct scientific research work while carrying out teaching work. Because only when teachers themselves engage in scientific research, transforming from mere transmitters of scientific knowledge into active participants in the invention and creation of science and technology, and deeply understand and develop theory through study and practice, can teachers' scientific knowledge be continuously enriched and improved. Only in this way can teachers cultivate qualified students and solve problems arising in economic construction. Therefore, scientific research in higher industrial schools is not a "cherry on top" beyond teaching work, but a fundamental task.

Some comrades believe that our teaching reform has not yet been completed. For example, issues such as teaching syllabi, textbooks, curriculum design, and graduation design have not yet been resolved. It is premature to talk about scientific research at this time. This view is not comprehensive. Because although the teaching reform work has not yet been completed, the specific tasks of each teaching and research section in the school are not completely the same. For example, the teaching and research sections of non-major courses do not need to prepare curriculum design and graduation design work; on the other hand, the work development of each teaching and research section has also been different since the beginning of the teaching reform work. For example, in some teaching and research sections, the textbook problem has been initially resolved, and the Soviet teaching methods have been initially familiarized. Therefore, some teaching and research sections are already equipped to start scientific research; moreover, teachers, in order to improve their professional level and teaching quality, have also felt the need to start scientific research work and have begun to explore in this area. For example, several thematic reports held by Tongji University's teaching and research sections in conjunction with the work of improving teachers can be regarded as a relatively elementary form of scientific research activity. Therefore, we believe that it is not only already possible but also necessary to gradually carry out scientific research work in schools now.

There are also some comrades who, although they also feel the importance of scientific research, make excessive and hasty demands. Excessive demands are manifested in raising the level of scientific research work too high at once, thus making it difficult or impossible for us to start. This is due to a lack of correct assessment of the domestic and school's actual situation. The level of science is determined by the development of production. In old China under reactionary rule, production was declining, and scientific research was not needed. Therefore, there was little or no scientific research in schools, so the research equipment was very poor, and our own research capabilities were not high. Today, the country has just begun socialist construction, and we want to start scientific research on the old basis. If the requirements are set too high, it is obviously also unrealistic. Hasty demands are manifested in seeing scientific research as very easy, eager for quick success, and thus unwilling to start from small things and make long-term plans. This is due to an underestimation of the arduousness and long-term nature of scientific research. Today, all sciences have developed to a considerable level. If we want to conduct research work, we need to accept this achievement and then move forward. This requires a lot of work, year after year, day after day, to carry out systematic, in-depth, meticulous, and small work. It is impossible to quickly achieve amazing results by suddenly having a flash of inspiration or taking shortcuts. Therefore, the ideas of demanding too much and being too hasty in scientific research hinder the development of scientific research work and need to be overcome. We should combine domestic production realities, based on the school's research equipment conditions and our own research capabilities, and carry out scientific research work from small to large, from shallow to deep, and gradually improve scientific research work through scientific research work itself.

Based on the above-mentioned understanding, Tongji University has raised the issue of scientific research this semester and has begun to experiment, deliberate, and prepare. In the teaching and research sections that have the strength to conduct research and have appropriate specific problems to study, we will start scientific research in order to gain experience. For example, the geodetic surveying and mapping teaching and research section has begun to draft research work on surveying and mapping regulations suitable for China's conditions, based on the Soviet surveying and mapping work regulations as a blueprint. For teaching and research sections that still lack appropriate research topics, we will try to gradually clarify their scientific research direction. For example, in the basic course teaching and research sections of our Civil Engineering and Architecture College, such as mathematics and physics teaching and research sections, its scientific research direction should be different from that of comprehensive universities. It needs to be determined in combination with the school's teachers, equipment conditions, and the scientific research direction of other relevant teaching and research sections in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to have a good discussion and research in the teaching and research section so that future scientific research work has a clear and correct direction. For other teaching and research sections, they are required to prepare conditions according to their own specific circumstances. For example, several teaching and research sections strive to complete the work of organizing textbooks this semester so that scientific research can begin next semester. We are conducting experiments, deliberations, and preparations in different teaching and research sections mainly to make some preliminary ideological preparations among teachers and school leaders so that more teaching and research sections can start scientific research work next semester.

In our future work of conducting scientific research, we will also learn from the Soviet Union as we do in conducting teaching reform. The characteristics of Soviet scientific research are: close contact with reality and full use of collective strength. In the future, we need to do a lot of ideological and organizational work in schools to implement this policy. However, we deeply feel that it is especially important to organize the scientific research forces, which are not many and therefore particularly valuable, on a national scale, to cooperate under unified leadership to study the current and future problems of the motherland's economic construction and national defense construction. Only in this way can potential forces be brought into play nationwide, avoid duplication and waste, and ensure that the problems of national construction are studied and resolved. The Central Government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have attached great importance to this issue, but we are still willing to repeat the reflection of this opinion in schools for the leadership's reference so that our scientific research work can be gradually carried out under correct leadership.

    关于在高等工业学校里开展科学研究工作的问题
    同济大学教务长　李国豪
    高等工业学校担负着双重的任务：一方面要为国家的社会主义建设培养合乎标准的人才；另一方面要为国家的社会主义建设解决工程理论和工程技术问题，提高工程理论和工程技术水平。要圆满地完成这两方面的任务，教师必须掌握本门课程中最新的科学成就、具备高度的理论修养并不断地进步。这样，就要求教师在进行教学工作的同时，必须进行科学研究工作。因为只有教师本身进行了科学研究，从仅仅是科学知识的传授者变成为科学技术的发明创造的积极参与者，通过钻研和实践来深刻认识理论并把它向前发展，教师的科学知识才能够不断地丰富和提高。只有这样，教师才能够培养出合乎标准的学生，才能够解决经济建设中所产生的问题。所以，科学研究在高等工业学校里并不是教学工作之外的“锦上添花”，而是根本性的工作。
    有一些同志认为，我们的教学改革尚未完成，例如教学大纲、教材、课程设计、毕业设计等等问题都还没有解决，此时谈科学研究，未免过早。这种看法是不全面的。因为教学改革工作虽说还没有完成，但在教学改革中，学校里各个教研室的具体任务是不完全相同的，例如非专业课程的教研室，就毋须做准备课程设计和毕业设计的工作；另一方面，自开始教学改革工作以来，各个教研室的工作发展也是不相同的。例如在一些教研室中，教材问题已经初步解决，苏联的教学方法也已经初步熟悉。所以在一部分教研室中是已经具备了开始科学研究的条件的；而且，教师们为了提高自己的业务水平和教学质量，也已经感到有开始科学研究工作的需要，并在这方面开始摸索。例如同济大学若干教研室，结合提高师资的工作举行的若干专题报告，就可以看作是比较初级形式的科学研究活动。所以我们认为，现在在学校里不但已经有条件，而且也已经有必要来逐步开展科学研究工作。
    还有一些同志，虽然也感到科学研究工作的重要，但是要求过高过急。要求过高表现于把科学研究工作的水平一下提得太高，因而使我们自己难于下手或者不敢下手。这是由于对国内、校内的实际情况缺乏正确估计所致。科学水平是决定于生产的发展的。在反动统治下的旧中国，生产落没，不需要科学研究，因此在学校里也就很少或者没有科学研究，所以研究的设备很差，我们本身的研究能力也不高。今天国家刚才开始社会主义的建设，我们要在旧的基础上开始科学研究，如果把要求提得太高，显然也是不切合实际的。要求过急的表现是，把科学研究看得很容易，急于求成，因而不愿从小处着手、作长远打算。这是由于对科学研究的艰苦性和长期性估量不足所致。今天各门科学都发展到了相当高的水平，我们要进行研究工作，就需要接受这一成果，然后再向前进步。这就需要做很多的工作，穷年累月、日复一日地进行有系统的、深入细致的、平凡细小的工作。想灵机一动、抄捷径来迅速取得惊人的成绩，是不可能的。所以，对科学研究要求过高和要求过急的思想，都妨碍着科学研究工作的开展，都需要加以克服。我们应当结合国内的生产实际，根据校内的研究设备条件和我们本身的研究能力，由小到大、由浅到深地来开展科学研究工作，通过科学研究工作本身来逐步提高科学研究工作。
    在以上所说的认识基础之上，同济大学于本学期已提出了科学研究的问题，并已开始试验、酝酿、准备。在有力量进行研究而又有适当的具体问题可以研究的教研室中，我们就开始科学研究，以便取得经验。例如大地测量教研室，已开始以苏联的测量工作细则为蓝本来拟订适合我国情况的测量工作细则的研究工作。对于尚缺乏适当研究题目的教研室，则求其逐渐明确认识它的科学研究的方向。例如在我们土木建筑学院的基础课教研室，如数学、物理等教研室，它的科学研究的方向应当和综合大学中的有所不同，它需要结合本校的师资、设备条件和其他有关教研室今后的科学研究的方向来加以规定，因此需要在教研室里很好地讨论研究，使以后的科学研究工作有明确的而且是正确的方向。对于其他教研室，则要求其根据本身的具体情况准备条件。例如有几个教研室，争取在本学期内完成整理教材的工作，以便下学期开始科学研究。我们这样在不同的教研室中进行试验、酝酿、准备，主要是为了在教师中和学校领导方面作些初步的思想准备，使下一学期有更多的教研室开始科学研究工作。
    在我们今后进行科学研究的工作中，我们也要和进行教学改革一样来学习苏联。苏联科学研究的特点是：密切联系实际和充分发挥集体力量。今后我们在学校里需要做许多思想上和组织上的工作来贯彻这个方针。但是，我们深切感到，在全国范围之内把现在并不算多因而格外宝贵的科学研究力量组织起来，在统一领导下分工合作来研究祖国经济建设上和国防建设上今天的和明天的问题，尤其重要。只有这样才能够在全国之内发挥潜在力量，避免重复浪费，并使国家建设上的问题都得到研究、解决。中央和中国科学院已十分重视这个问题，但我们仍愿重复反映学校里的这种意见，以供领导方面参考，使我们的科学研究工作能够在正确的领导下逐步开展。
