Actively Supply Industrial Equipment
The Shenyang City Company of China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation has supplied a large amount of industrial equipment to factories, mines, and basic construction units this year. By the end of April, it had supplied nearly 10,000 tons of steel pipes, steel plates, and other steel products, as well as 118 machine tools. The supply of steel products increased threefold compared to the same period last year. They have also actively sought ways to supply special specifications of equipment needed for some key projects. For example, regarding serpentinite steel, which the company had never handled before, they overcame various difficulties to supply the needs of the Dahuofang Reservoir project. In light of the increasing installation of Soviet-style machinery, small hardware stores have prepared more than 200 specifications of precision screws. Currently, the company is gradually strengthening the planning of its supply work, striving to connect the supply plan with the procurement plans of most factories and mines, in order to better carry out the supply work.

Actively Manage Means of Production
Stepping into the means of production sales department of the Nanguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, one can see waterwheels hanging from the roof beams and plows and harrows placed on the ground. Whether it's sickles, hoes, buckets, manure buckets, bamboo baskets, rice winnows, or fertilizers, everything is available. In addition, behind the sales department, there are six workers diligently repairing old farm tools for farmers at two blacksmithing stoves.

In the past, this supply and marketing cooperative was also unwilling to manage means of production. Under the guidance of the general task of the state's transition period, in February of this year, they went to nearby agricultural production mutual aid organizations to understand their needs for means of production. At the same time, they signed supply and marketing combination contracts with six agricultural production cooperatives, including Huangzhuang and Hewei, and organized more than 40 mutual aid groups to submit orders for spring production materials. Later, they established two blacksmithing stoves to repair farm tools for farmers and organized local blacksmiths, carpenters, and bamboo craftsmen to vigorously process various farm tools. In the first quarter, the cooperative supplied farmers with more than 1,000 farm tools, repaired more than 1,300 old farm tools for farmers, and supplied eight draught cattle. Many local farmers said, "This year, the Nanguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative has everything from draught cattle and waterwheels to needles and thread. It has really changed!"

Timely Delivery of Pesticides to Pest-Infested Areas
In order to help farmers combat insect pests, the Guanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, transported a large quantity of 666 insecticide powder. Because the local villages are scattered and farmers are busy with rush planting, they adopted the method of delivering pesticides to the countryside. Dou Hongfa, a cadre and member of the Youth League of the cooperative, took on this task. One day, he carried 50 kilograms of 666 insecticide powder and other items to Xintuan Village. With the help of village cadres, he introduced the effectiveness and usage of 666 powder for pest control to the farmers that evening. Farmers bought 40 kilograms of 666 insecticide powder in one night.

Supply a Large Quantity of Medicines to Industrial and Mining Areas
This year, the Yunnan Provincial Company of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has established close contact with the infirmaries of various factories in Kunming City, signed contracts, and supplied medicines according to plan. At the same time, it organized sales teams to go deep into various factories to supply nutritional products such as vitamins and over-the-counter medicines such as pain relievers, so that workers could conveniently buy the medicines they needed. The company has also strengthened its supply work to important factories and mines in Gejiu, Dongchuan, and other places. In the past, it often took months for the medicines needed by Gejiu to be allocated. Now, the medicines can be delivered within seven days. The company also sent people to Dongchuan to investigate the drug needs of employees and signed a long-term drug supply contract with the Dongchuan Mining Bureau infirmary.

In March, the company began preparing for summer medicines. Now, a large number of DDT powder, cool oil, emergency water, and other medicines, as well as DDT sprayers and other epidemic prevention and insecticide equipment, have been transported from Shanghai and Chongqing. At the same time, local pharmaceutical factories were organized to process a batch of DDT insecticide solution. These medicines and insecticide equipment, in addition to being supplied in Kunming, have been successively transported to Gejiu, Xiaguan, Zhaotong, and other places to meet the needs of employees.

Deliver Goods to Mountainous Areas
On April 15th, the Naji Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Arong Banner, Inner Mongolia, delivered a truckload of goods to Dayouzhuang in the mountainous area. The next day, as soon as dawn broke, the people of Dayouzhuang flocked to the stall set up by the supply and marketing cooperative. Next to the farm tools stall, farmers surrounded it, selecting various small farm tools and new-style farm tools. Women selected their favorite colorful silks and inexpensive, novel-colored Soviet fabrics at the silk and calico stalls. Some housewives sold baskets of fresh eggs, apricot kernels, and other products to the supply and marketing cooperative and bought daily necessities such as oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar at the daily commodities stall.

In this remote mountain village, in three days, the supply and marketing cooperative supplied farmers with goods worth more than 5.6 million yuan and purchased agricultural and sideline products worth more than 3.9 million yuan.

Exhibit Samples, Solicit Consumer Opinions
From mid-April to early May, the Northwest District Company and Xi'an City Company of China National Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Corporation, together with the Supply and Marketing Department of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau, the Xin Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the Northwest Art College, jointly organized a flower cloth sample exhibition. The exhibition was held successively in factories and rural areas in Xi'an, Chang'an, Xingping, and other places. The exhibited samples included more than 800 kinds of flower cloth and a part of silk fabrics, as well as a batch of newly designed flower cloth patterns. According to incomplete statistics, more than 35,000 people visited the exhibition. After the exhibition in the Northwest Second State-owned Cotton Textile Factory and Xingping County, a symposium was also held to solicit opinions widely.

Workers, farmers, and others enthusiastically commented on the exhibited samples and design patterns, and put forward many opinions. Some flower cloths at the exhibition had not met the broad consumers in the past, and many viewers criticized the commercial departments for this. At present, relevant units are studying the opinions of the masses and preparing to improve flower cloth design, color matching, supply, and other work.

Sign Non-Staple Food Production and Sales Contracts with Farmers
In the past, the Tangshan Mine Consumers Cooperative of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration purchased most of the vegetables and other non-staple foods supplied to employees from the market. When there were not many non-staple foods on the market, it could not meet the needs of employees, and sometimes the prices were also expensive. In order to improve the supply of non-staple foods, in March, the cooperative sent cadres to the suburbs to contact agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. In May, on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, it signed non-staple food production and sales contracts with eight agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in the suburbs. The contract stipulated that the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups are responsible for supplying vegetables and other non-staple foods according to plan, and the consumers cooperative is responsible for supplying raw materials for making non-staple foods such as tofu according to plan. From the beginning of May to May 22, these agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups supplied the Tangshan Mine Consumers Cooperative with more than 50,000 catties of vegetables and a large number of non-staple foods such as tofu and liangfen, worth more than 61.8 million yuan. In this way, the consumers cooperative can fully supply fresh and inexpensive non-staple foods, while supporting the agricultural and sideline production of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and saving farmers time to sell non-staple foods on the market.

Fresh Fish and Shrimp in the Freezing Plant
The Changchun City Company of China National Food Corporation has newly built a freezing plant this year. This freezing plant has an area of 200 square meters. There are five freezing rooms in the plant, and the indoor temperature is constantly maintained at about minus seven degrees Celsius, which can freeze fresh fish into ice blocks. Currently, a large number of flatfish, carp, prawns, and other aquatic products and pork are stored here. It is expected that people in Changchun City can eat fresh-smelling prawns until National Day this year.

Go Deep into the Heart of the Lake to Purchase Fresh Fish
This year, Liangzi Lake in Echeng County, Hubei Province, has had a bumper harvest of fish. According to incomplete statistics, the current daily output of fresh fish is about 70,000 to 80,000 catties, exceeding the output of the same period last year by 30% to 40%. In the past, after fishermen caught fresh fish, they had to transport them 40 li by water to Liangzi Town to sell, which not only delayed production time, but also often suffered from the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants who suppressed prices. This year, the Liangzi Fishermen's Cooperative leased ten fishing boats, organized four mobile working groups, and went deep into the heart of the lake to purchase fresh fish, and supplied fishermen with the means of production and means of subsistence they needed. According to the statistics of 45 days in the first quarter, the cooperative sold 350,000 catties of fresh fish for fishermen, and supplied fishermen with various production tools worth more than 54 million yuan and means of subsistence worth more than 873 million yuan, which was warmly supported by more than 10,000 fishermen in the whole lake.

    更好地为生产和消费者服务
    大力供应工业器材
    中国五金机械公司沈阳市公司今年已供应给工厂、矿山和基本建设单位大量工业器材。到四月底，即供应了近万吨的钢管、钢板等钢材和一百一十八台工作母机；其中钢材供应量比去年同时期增加三倍。有些重点工程需要的特殊规格的器材，也积极设法供应。如蛇龙钢，该公司从来没有经营过，为了支援大伙房水库工程，他们也克服各种困难，供应了水库工程的需要。根据安装苏联式机器日益增多的情况，小五金商店准备了二百多种规格的精密螺丝。目前，该公司正逐步加强供应工作的计划性，争取使供应计划和大部分厂矿的采购计划衔接起来，以便更好地进行供应工作。　（王曾）
      积极经营生产资料
    走进安徽省桐城县南关供销合作社的生产资料门市部可以看到屋梁上挂的水车，地上放的犁、耙，不论镰刀、锄头、水桶、粪桶，还是笆斗、稻箩、肥料，真是应有尽有。另外，门市部后面还有六个工人在两盘铁匠炉上钉钉当当地为农民修理旧的农具。
    这个供销合作社过去也不大愿意经营生产资料。在国家过渡时期总任务的照耀下，今年二月间，他们到附近的农业生产互助合作组织中了解了需要生产资料的情况，同时和黄庄、和圩等六个农业生产合作社签订了供销结合合同，组织四十多个互助组提出了春季生产资料的订货单。后来，他们建立了两盘铁匠炉，为农民整修农具；同时组织当地的铁工、木工、篾工大力加工各种农具。该社在第一季度就供应给农民一千多件农具、为农民修理旧农具一千三百多件，并供应了八条耕牛。当地许多农民说：“今年，南关供销合作社从耕牛、水车到针线，样样齐全，真是变了样啦！”
    及时把农药送到有虫害地区
    江苏省东海县官庄供销合作社为了帮助农民战胜虫灾，运到了大批六六六杀虫粉。由于当地村庄分散，农民又正在忙着抢种，他们便采用了送药下乡的办法。该社干部、青年团团员窦洪法担负了这一任务。有一天，他挑了五十斤六六六杀虫粉和其他物品到新疃村，在村干部的帮助下，当天晚上向农民介绍了六六六药粉治虫的效能和用法。农民们一晚上就买了四十斤六六六杀虫药粉。
    供应工矿区大批药品
    中国医药公司云南省公司今年和昆明市各工厂的医务室建立了密切的联系，订立合同，按计划供应药品；同时，组织推销小组，深入各工厂供应维生素等营养品和止痛片等成药，使工人们能很方便地买到自己需要的药品。对个旧、东川等地的重要厂矿，该公司也加强了供应工作。过去，个旧需要的药品，常常拖延几个月才能调拨到，现在七天以内就能把药品送去。该公司还派人到东川调查了职工需要药品的情况，并和东川矿务局医务所订了长期的药品供应合同。
    三月间，该公司即着手准备夏令药品。现在，已从上海、重庆运到大批滴滴涕粉、清凉油、救急水等药品和滴滴涕喷雾器等防疫和杀虫器械。同时，组织当地制药厂加工了一批滴滴涕杀虫液。这些药品、杀虫器械，除在昆明供应外，已陆续运往个旧、下关、昭通等地，供应职工需要。
      把货物送到山区
    四月十五日，内蒙古阿荣旗那吉供销合作社把一车货物送到山区的大有庄。第二天，天刚蒙蒙亮，大有庄的人们就成群结队地奔向供销合作社摆摊的地方。农具摊的旁边，围满了选购各种小农具和新式农具的农民。妇女们在绸缎摊和花布摊上，选购着可心的各色绸缎和物美价廉、色彩新颖的苏联花布。有些家庭主妇把一筐筐的鲜蛋、杏核等卖给供销合作社，又在日用商品摊上买了油、盐、酱、醋等生活必需品。
    在这偏僻的山村里，三天的工夫，供销合作社就供给农民价值五百六十多万元的货物，收购了价值三百九十多万元的农、副业产品。
    展览样品，征求消费者意见
    中国花纱布公司西北区公司及西安市公司和西北纺织管理局供销处、新西北印染厂、西北艺术专科学校等五个单位，在四月中旬到五月上旬，联合组织了一次花布样品展览会。先后在西安、长安、兴平等地的工厂和农村等处进行了展览。展览的样品，有八百多种花布及一部分绸缎，另外还有一批新设计的花布图案。据不完全统计，参观展览的有三万五千多人。在国营西北第二棉纺织厂和兴平县展览以后，还召开座谈会，广泛征求了意见。
    工人、农民等对展览样品和设计图案热烈加以品评，提出不少意见。展览会上有些花布过去没有和广大消费者见面，许多观众也为此向商业部门提出了批评。目前，有关单位正在研究广大群众的意见，准备改进花布设计、配色、供应等工作。

    和农民订副食品产销合同
    开滦煤矿总管理处唐山矿消费合作社过去供应职工的蔬菜等副食品，大部分是从市场上采购的，碰到市场上副食品不多，就不能满足职工需要，有时价钱也贵。为了改进副食品供应工作，该社在三月间派干部到郊区和农业生产合作社、互助组进行了联系，五月份，在自愿和互利的原则下，和郊区的八个农业生产社、互助组签订了副食品产销合同。合同中规定，农业生产合作社和互助组负责按计划供给蔬菜等副食品，消费合作社按计划供给制造豆腐等副食品的原料。从五月初到五月二十二日，这些农业生产合作社和互助组就供给唐山矿消费合作社五万多斤蔬菜和大批豆腐、凉粉等副食品，共值六千一百八十多万元。这样，就使消费合作社能充分地供应新鲜、便宜的副食品，同时支持了农业生产合作社和互助组的农、副业生产，节省了农民到市场上出卖副食品的时间。

      冷冻厂里的新鲜鱼虾
    中国食品公司长春市公司今年新建设了一个冷冻厂。这个冷冻厂的面积有二百平方公尺。厂中有五个冻结室，室内温度经常保持在零下七度左右，可以把鲜鱼冻成冰块。目前，这里保藏着大批偏口鱼、鲤鱼、对虾等水产和猪肉。预计今年长春市的人们，一直到国庆节都可以吃到气味新鲜的对虾。
      深入湖心收购鲜鱼
    今年，湖北省鄂城县梁子湖鱼产丰收，据不完全统计，目前每日出水鲜鱼约七、八万斤，超过去年同期产量百分之三十到四十。以往，渔民捕得鲜鱼后，须水运四十里到梁子镇出卖，不仅耽误生产时间，而且常受奸商压价收买的剥削。今年，梁子渔民合作社租赁了十只渔船，组织四个流动工作组，深入湖心流动收购鲜鱼，并供应渔民需要的生产资料和生活资料。据第一季度中四十五天的统计，合作社为渔民推销的鲜鱼即有三十五万斤，供应给渔民的各种生产工具值五千四百多万元，生活资料值八亿七千三百多万元，受到全湖一万多渔民的热烈拥护。
