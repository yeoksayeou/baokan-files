    [Report from this newspaper] The promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has greatly inspired the political enthusiasm and labor activism of the vast working class across the country. They have expressed their desire to conscientiously discuss the Draft Constitution and support it with practical actions in production.

    On the morning of June 19th, workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works took advantage of their break time to hold a symposium on the Draft Constitution. Li Shaokui, leader of Team C of Open Hearth Furnace No. 8, said: "To celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, we must strive to produce steel according to the steel grade from now on, implement fixed material smelting methods to ensure significant savings in steelmaking raw materials, reduce costs, better implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, protect the furnace body, and strive for the furnace roof to be used more than the current record of 228 times (originally stipulated at 160 times)." Wang Songwen, leader of Team B of Open Hearth Furnace No. 8, said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates that the state-owned economy is the leading force in the national economy and the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation. The state guarantees the priority development of the state-owned economy. After reading this, I feel that my job is more glorious than ever! In the future, I will not only better fulfill the state production plan, but also help others fulfill the state production plan." Steelworker Ni Fuqing said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates our rights and also stipulates our obligations. In the future, I must exemplaryly abide by labor discipline and technical operating procedures to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the plan assigned to me by the state." Zhang Ju'an, a steelworker, said: "I have calculated it many times in my heart. I think the best way to support the Draft Constitution is to strive for newer achievements in production and guarantee to produce more and better steel for the country."
    On the morning of the 15th, when miners, steelworkers, and petroleum workers in Fushun City—the coal capital—were on their way to work, they heard the good news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. Many people immediately gathered around the loudspeaker to listen attentively. Miners at the Liushan Inclined Shaft construction site held a symposium on the Draft Constitution in their spare time. Hou Detang, an old coal miner at Longfeng Mine, immediately told everyone in the palm of his hand the good news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. After hearing this, everyone's enthusiasm for production increased, and the first shot hit an eye one meter seven deep.
    The masses of workers and staff in Harbin City, greatly encouraged by the Draft Constitution, expressed their determination to work harder in production. Li Mingshun, an advanced producer in Harbin City and a lathe operator at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, said: The Draft Constitution stipulates that the state-owned economy is the material basis for the state to realize socialist transformation, and the state uses economic plans to guide the development and transformation of the national economy to improve the material and cultural life of the people. Our working class must take on this great task. We must push the technical innovation to a climax. Liu Jinlan, a female worker at the Harbin Flax Factory, said: The Draft Constitution stipulates that women are equal to men in political and economic status. We must use the action of overfulfilling production tasks to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. The Meng Zhaoming Advanced Production Team of the Harbin Flax Factory has overfulfilled the state plan every month from October last year to May this year. The day before the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, they completed the task for the first half of June one day ahead of schedule. Meng Zhaoming said that he would fulfill the obligations of citizens stipulated in the Draft Constitution with exemplary actions.
    When the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution reached Taiyuan City, the broadcasting stations of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Works, the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and the 360 Engineering Company broadcast the full text of the Draft Constitution to the workers and staff. Many workers expressed their feelings during the discussion. Huang Qingtai, a 23-year-old young labor model in the electric furnace steelmaking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Works, who was born into a poor peasant family and gradually promoted from an apprentice to a workshop director since 1950, said with emotion at the symposium: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given me the right to work and study, and I must become a model for abiding by and implementing the Constitution. Gong Caibian, a female worker at the Jinsheng Textile Factory who suffered endless torture in the old society, said: The laws of the old society were chains on the working people, and today's Constitution is the backing of our happy life. The Liu Qinglin team of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Works said that they would complete the task of overhauling the hard coal hoist in the coal washing plant, which would normally take twelve hours, in ten hours.
    The news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution caused great jubilation among the workers on the Wushaoling construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and among the workers building the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. Loudspeakers on the construction site constantly broadcast the news of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution. On the construction sites of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the workers jumped up excitedly after hearing the news. Hu Youmei, a famous female bulldozer operator, was recently elected as a people's representative of Gulang County, Gansu Province. She was particularly excited about Article 96 of the Draft Constitution, which states that women have equal rights with men; and she said that she would better master bulldozer technology in the future and work like male workers. Xiong Guanghua, the worker who created the "fast backfilling method for scraper," said that he would better lead everyone in road construction so that steel rails could be quickly laid to Yumen and transport the oil needed for the construction of the motherland to various places. In recent days, many advanced workers in Shanghai have expressed their feelings about the Draft Constitution. Wang Derong, an old planer at the switch factory of the Shanghai Railway Administration Engineering Repair Shop, who participated in the "February 7th" strike struggle and completed fourteen months of production tasks in February, March, and April of this year, said with emotion after seeing the Draft Constitution: In the past, money was the law, and assemblies and parades were illegal. Workers' jobs were not guaranteed. Now, the rights of the people are clearly stipulated in the Draft Constitution. Shi Xiaomei, a female textile worker who has told her story of more than 30 years of revolutionary struggle to more than 23,000 workers, students, and women in more than two months, said: I am over sixty years old and can still see the promulgation of my Draft Constitution. I am really happy. This is really a great event for the people of the whole country. On the 16th, at a symposium held at the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory for labor models, advanced workers, and elderly workers, Huang Jingshun, a 66-year-old worker who was worried about being fired in his old age in the old society, said with emotion: Our Draft Constitution protects labor, encourages labor, and stipulates that labor is a glorious thing. This is impossible in any country except China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. Zhang Xiaomei, a national textile industry labor model, Xiang Fengqi, a Shanghai labor model, and others said after seeing the Draft Constitution stipulating that workers have the right to rest and the right to work: Our status has been improved, and the burden we shoulder is also heavier. We must study hard and take the lead in completing socialist construction.
    The technical innovation movement in the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Wuhan City has been promoted a step further by the encouragement of the Draft Constitution. On the evening of the 17th, twenty outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and young workers, including Hu Guoding and Zhang Dexin, who were commended for their pioneering spirit, made a suggestion to more than 400 young workers in the factory. The suggestion said: We are determined to express our heartfelt support for the Draft Constitution with greater labor achievements and strive to improve product quality and save national wealth by means of technical innovation. These twenty young workers also formulated three guarantees for improving product quality, saving materials, and saving man-hours, as well as a system for checking the implementation of these guarantees. This suggestion spread like wildfire throughout the factory. Young workers were studying drafts of improved tools in twos and threes. The assembly of bogies is a relatively weak link in the production of the passenger car workshop. Chen Desheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, excitedly studied the method of improving bogie assembly in the dormitory until late at night on the 17th, and he was still drawing drafts on the dining table with chalk during lunch on the 18th.

    【本报讯】中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布，大大鼓舞了各地广大工人阶级的政治热情和劳动积极性。他们纷纷表示要认真讨论宪法草案，并用生产上的实际行动来拥护宪法草案。
    六月十九日上午，鞍钢炼钢厂的工人，利用歇班时间举行了宪法草案座谈会。八号平炉的丙班炉长李绍奎说：“为了庆祝宪法草案的公布，今后我们一定要争取做到按钢种出钢；实行定料炼法，保证大量节省炼钢原料，降低成本，更好地贯彻苏联专家的建议，保护好炉体，争取今后的炉顶使用次数超过现在的二百二十八次的纪录（原规定一百六十次）。”八号平炉乙班炉长王宋文说：“宪法草案规定：国营经济是国民经济中的领导力量和国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础。国家保证优先发展国营经济。我看了这一条以后，感到我的工作岗位再光荣不过了！今后我不但要更好地完成国家生产计划，还要帮助别人完成国家生产计划。”炼钢工人倪福清说：“宪法草案规定了我们的权利，也规定了我们的义务，以后我一定要模范地遵守劳动纪律、技术操作规程，保证完成与超额完成国家交给我的计划。”平炉炼钢工人张居安说：“我在心里核计好多次了，我想拥护宪法草案的最好方法就是争取在生产上取得更新的成绩。保证为国家炼出更多更好的钢。”
    十五日清晨，煤都——抚顺市的矿工、炼钢工人、石油工人们正上班工作的时候，听到了宪法草案公布的喜讯，许多人立即围在广播筒下，倾耳静听。刘山斜井工地建设新矿井的矿工们利用业余时间举行了一次宪法草案座谈会。龙凤矿老采煤工人侯德堂听见公布宪法草案的消息，马上把这个喜讯告诉掌子里的每个人。大家听后生产的劲头更大了，头一遍炮就打了一公尺七深的眼。
    哈尔滨市职工群众，受到宪法草案的极大鼓舞，纷纷表示要更加努力生产。哈尔滨市先进生产者、哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂车工李明顺说：宪法草案中规定国营经济是国家实现社会主义改造的物质基础，国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，这个伟大任务，我们工人阶级一定得担当起来。我们一定要把技术革新推向高潮。哈尔滨亚麻厂女工刘金兰说：宪法草案规定妇女在政治、经济地位上和男子平等。我们一定要用超额完成生产任务的行动来庆贺宪法草案的公布。哈尔滨亚麻厂孟昭明先进生产小组从去年十月到今年五月，月月超额完成国家计划，宪法草案公布的前一天又提前一天完成了六月上半月的任务。孟昭明表示要以模范的行动履行宪法草案中规定的公民的义务。
    当宪法草案公布的消息传到太原市后，太原钢铁厂、太原矿山机器厂、三六○工程公司的广播站都向职工们播送了宪法草案的全文。座谈时许多工人发表了自己的感想。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部二十三岁的青年劳动模范黄庆泰，是一个出生在贫农的家庭里并从一九五零年由学徒逐步提升到当工场长的人，座谈会上他感动地说：共产党、毛主席给了我劳动和学习的权利，我一定要成为遵守和执行宪法的模范。在旧社会里受尽折磨的晋生纺织厂女工弓彩变说：旧社会的法律是劳动人民身上的锁链，今天的宪法是我们幸福生活的靠山。太原钢铁厂刘庆林小组表示要用十小时完成十二小时才能完成的检修洗煤场硬煤提升机的任务。
    宪法草案公布的消息，在修筑兰新铁路的乌鞘岭工地上和修筑宝成铁路北段的职工中，引起了巨大的欢腾。工地上的扩音器不断地播送着宪法草案公布的消息。在修筑宝成铁路北段的各工地上，职工们听到消息后，都兴奋地跳跃起来。著名女推土机手胡友梅，最近被选为甘肃省古浪县的人民代表，她对宪法草案第九十六条妇女同男子有平等权利一点特别感到兴奋；并且表示今后要更好地掌握推土机技术，像男工人一样地工作。创造“铲运机快速倒土法”的工人熊光华表示要更好地带动大家筑路，让钢轨迅速铺向玉门，把建设祖国需要的石油运往各地。几天来，上海许多先进工人纷纷发表对宪法草案的感想。曾经参加过“二七”罢工斗争的上海铁路管理局工务修配所道岔工场老刨工王德荣，在今年二、三、四三个月中完成了十四个月的生产任务，他看到宪法草案后感动地说：过去，有钱就是法律，集会、游行都是犯法，工人职业没有保障，现在宪法草案上把人民的权利都明确规定下来了。曾经在两个多月来向二万三千多工人、学生、妇女讲过自己三十多年革命斗争故事的纺织女工施小妹说：我六十多岁还能看到自己的宪法草案的公布，真高兴，这实在是全国人民的大喜事。十六日，在国营上海第一棉纺织厂举行的劳动模范、先进工作者和老年工人的座谈会上，曾在旧社会里耽心年老被开除的六十六岁的老工人黄景顺感动地说：我们的宪法草案保护劳动、鼓励劳动，规定劳动是光荣的事情，这除了我们中国、苏联和人民民主国家外，任何国家都是不可能有的。全国纺织工业劳动模范张小妹、上海市劳动模范相凤祁等看到宪法草案上规定了工人有休息权和劳动权后说：我们的地位提高了，挑的担子也重了，我们得好好学习本领，带头完成社会主义建设。
    武汉市江岸机车车辆修理工厂的技术革新运动受到宪法草案的鼓舞已向前推进了一步。十七日晚，因为具有首创精神而受到表扬的胡国定、张德馨等二十个优秀青年团员和青年工人，向全厂四百多个青年工人提出了一项建议。建议中说：我们决心以更大的劳动成就来表示对宪法草案衷心的拥护，用技术革新的办法努力提高产品质量，节约国家财富。这二十个青年工人同时订出了提高产品质量、节约材料、节约工时的三项保证和实现这些保证的检查制度。这个建议像风一样在全厂传开了。青年工人们三三两两地在一起研究着改进工具的草图。台车的组装工作是客车工场生产上比较薄弱的一环，青年团员陈德胜十七日晚上就兴奋地在宿舍里研究改进台车组装方法直到深夜，十八日吃中午饭时他还用粉笔在饭桌上画着草图。
