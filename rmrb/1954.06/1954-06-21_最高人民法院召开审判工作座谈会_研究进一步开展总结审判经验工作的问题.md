    Supreme People's Court Holds Symposium on Judicial Work
    Studying the Issue of Further Developing the Work of Summarizing Judicial Experience
    The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government held a symposium on judicial work from May 20th to June 15th, focusing on studying the issue of further developing the work of summarizing judicial experience.
    At the beginning of the symposium, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, explained the significance of holding this symposium. He said: The task of our courts is to use the weapon of law to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and ensure the smooth progress of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. In order to accomplish this task, our judicial work must be further strengthened. Today, everyone is here to meet, exchange and summarize judicial experience, and put forward opinions on further promoting this work in the future. This is very important for strengthening future judicial work and consolidating the people's democratic legal system; it is also of great significance for further improving the political ideology, policy, and professional level of judicial personnel.
    Zhang Zhirang, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, delivered a speech at the meeting on the summary of judicial experience work and future promotion methods.
    After discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed that since the Second National Judicial Conference in 1953 proposed summarizing judicial experience, the vast majority of people's courts above the provincial and municipal levels and many grassroots people's courts have successively carried out the work of summarizing judicial experience. Through summarizing judicial experience, the ideological and policy level of judicial personnel has been effectively strengthened and improved. For example, some capitalists in Shanghai cut corners and used inferior materials to replace good materials when undertaking the manufacture of rubber oil pipes, causing the products to be substandard and accidents to occur. The judicial personnel of the local people's court only gave the capitalists a reprimand and returned the goods. In summarizing judicial experience, the errors in the handling of this case were discovered and corrected in a timely manner, which improved the judicial personnel's vigilance against the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists. People's courts in various places can also summarize judicial experience in conjunction with the central work, so that judicial work can better serve the central work. In the spring plowing production in Jiangxi Province, the judicial experience in handling disputes over mountains, forests, and water conservancy was summarized, and the disputes that had occurred were quickly resolved, and the increase in such disputes was prevented. The peasants said: When disputes are resolved, production is reassured. Through the work of summarizing judicial experience, the causes of various crimes and disputes can be found, so that crime can be prevented and disputes can be reduced in all aspects. In summarizing the judicial experience related to economic construction, the Nanning Municipal People's Court in Guangxi Province discovered that merchants who operated building timber had transformed into itinerant merchants, colluding with rich peasants to engage in speculation and disrupt the market. After the People's Court reported the summary to the local Party and government leading organs, the Party and government leaders made a decision on the unified sales of important building materials based on the summary, effectively cracking down on unscrupulous merchants. In summarizing the corruption cases after the "Three-Anti" campaign, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court discovered that among the 78 corrupt officials accepted in the first half of 1953, 21 were from the cooperative system. After the People's Court pointed out the reasons for the occurrence of corruption crimes to the leaders of the cooperatives, it aroused the attention of the leaders of the cooperatives, and they actively prevented the occurrence of corruption incidents, and the phenomenon of corruption in the cooperative departments decreased in the second half of the year. In addition, through summarizing judicial experience, the supervision and guidance of higher-level courts over lower-level courts has also been strengthened, which has gradually strengthened the work of judicial organs at all levels.
    The meeting unified its understanding of summarizing judicial experience in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. The meeting believes that regularly and conscientiously summarizing the practical experience of judicial activities is an important link in making judicial work adapt to the continuous changes and development of the economic foundation of the country during the transition period and the increasingly sharp and complex class struggle, and giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of judicial work in serving the country's overall tasks. The meeting also believes that people's courts above the provincial and municipal levels should generally carry out the work of summarizing judicial experience this year, and grassroots people's courts should promote this work with emphasis.

    最高人民法院召开审判工作座谈会
    研究进一步开展总结审判经验工作的问题
    中央人民政府最高人民法院在五月二十日到六月十五日召开审判工作座谈会，着重研究进一步开展总结审判经验工作的问题。
    座谈会开始，最高人民法院院长沈钧儒说明召开这次座谈会的意义。他说：我们法院的任务是要用法律的武器来巩固人民民主专政，保障国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。为了完成这项任务，我们的审判工作必须进一步加强。今天大家来开会，互相交流和总结审判经验，提出今后进一步推行这项工作的意见，这对加强今后的审判工作，巩固人民民主法制是非常重要的；对审判工作人员的政治思想和政策业务水平的进一步提高也有很大意义。
    最高人民法院副院长张志让在会上作了关于总结审判经验工作的总结和今后推行办法的发言。
    会议经过讨论，一致认为：自从一九五三年第二届全国司法会议提出总结审判经验以来，全国绝大多数省市以上人民法院和许多基层人民法院先后进行了总结审判经验的工作。通过总结审判经验，有效地加强和提高了审判工作人员的思想和政策水平。如上海的一些资本家在承制橡皮输油管时，偷工减料，以次料顶好料，使产品不合规格，并发生了事故。当地人民法院审判人员对这个案件的处理，仅仅给予资本家以训诫的处分，退货了事。在总结审判经验中，发现这个案件在处理上的错误，及时予以纠正，提高了审判人员对不法资本家“五毒”行为的警惕。各地人民法院并能结合中心工作总结审判经验，使审判工作能更好地为中心工作服务。江西省人民法院在春耕生产中，由于总结了山林水利纠纷的审判经验，迅速解决了已发生的纠纷，并防止了这种纠纷的增多。农民们说：纠纷解决了，生产就安心。通过总结审判经验的工作，可以找出各种犯罪和纠纷产生的原因，这样就可以从各方面预防犯罪和减少纠纷。广西省南宁市人民法院在总结有关经济建设的审判经验中，发现经营建筑木材的坐商化为行商，勾结富农投机倒把，破坏市场。经人民法院把总结向当地党政领导机关报告后，党政领导方面根据总结，作出了关于重要的建筑器材统一销售的决定，有效地打击了奸商。天津市人民法院在总结“三反”后的贪污案件时，发现一九五三年上半年受理的案件内贪污犯七十八人中，有二十一人是合作社系统的。经人民法院向合作社领导方面指出发生贪污犯罪的原因后，引起了合作社领导方面的注意，并积极防止贪污事件的发生，下半年合作社部门内贪污的现象便减少了。此外，通过总结审判经验，还加强了上级法院对下级法院的监督和指导作用，这就使各级审判机关的工作逐步加强起来。
    会议根据批评和自我批评的精神，统一了对总结审判经验的认识。会议认为经常地、认真地总结审判活动的实践经验，是使审判工作适应国家在过渡时期经济基础不断变革、发展，阶级斗争日益尖锐和复杂的特点，充分发挥审判工作为国家总任务服务的主动性、积极性的重要环节。会议并认为今年各省、市以上人民法院应普遍进行总结审判经验的工作，基层人民法院应有重点地推行这项工作。
