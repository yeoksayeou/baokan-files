France Bleeds, Wall Street Profits
    Yan Nan
    In the eight-year war of aggression against Indochina, the French colonialists lost nearly 400,000 troops. In the Dien Bien Phu campaign, they lost all the stakes they had placed—more than 16,000 men. However, they are still not reconciled. In order to continue this adventurous gamble, the French government recently decided to call up 80,000 young men in advance to replace the regular army, so that they can be transferred to the Indochina battlefield to fight.
    Undoubtedly, this French government's attempt to continue the "dirty war" with the blood of French youth will arouse the anger of hundreds of thousands of French mothers and wives, and will also arouse the anger of people all over the world who hope for a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue. However, for the American monopoly capitalists on the other side of the Atlantic, this is excellent news. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on May 29, the French government's "decision was welcomed by the (US) Department of Defense, the State Department, and members of Congress, who considered it an encouraging sign that France was determined to oppose appeasement (should be read as peaceful negotiation) and will continue to fight."
    It is not surprising that American monopoly capitalists regard the news that France "will continue to fight" as an "encouraging sign," because expanding the Indochina war is precisely what Wall Street has been praying for day and night and is putting great pressure on the French government to do. Its mouthpiece, "The Wall Street Journal," openly stated: "We are standing on the threshold of an economic decline deeper than in 1949... We do not know of any new ways to stimulate production, but if Indochina becomes a new Korea, our economy can rebound like in 1950 (i.e., the year the Korean War broke out)."
    The fact is also true: the blood shed by French youth in Indochina has caused stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange to rise continuously. Recent news from New York said that by May 8, the average price of 60 stocks on the New York Stock Market had risen to a new high since April 7, 1930. American economist Bi Bosheng pointed out that the reason for the current rise in American stocks is due to "military speculation," "because Wall Street believes that we will lead a war against China and threaten to use atomic bombs. We are already supplying aircraft, weapons, and ammunition to Indochina and France." Bi Bosheng also said that if the Far East issue is resolved through negotiation, stock prices will fall.
    Therefore, it is not difficult for us to understand why the United States sends a large number of aircraft, weapons, and ammunition to the hands of the French colonial army in Indochina, and why the United States airlifts troops from its country to Indochina for France from thousands of miles away. It turns out that Wall Street merchants regard pouring in the blood of French youth as a good way to "stimulate production"!
    In this way, the Lanier government's decision to invest another batch of bets in the war of aggression against Indochina is naturally "welcomed" and "encouraged" by Wall Street. Wall Street bosses seem to see more dollars stained with the blood of French youth falling into their pockets...
    However, Wall Street's "wishful thinking" does not seem to be so wishful. The fact that the Geneva Conference has made progress in the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and that the two headquarters are preparing to discuss the issue of cessation of hostilities, proves this.

    法兰西流血，华尔街赚钱
    燕南
    法国殖民者在侵略印度支那的八年战争中，输去了将近四十万兵员，在奠边府战役中压上的一批赌注——一万六千多人又一下子输得精光。然而，它还不甘心，为了继续进行这场冒险的赌博，最近法国政府又决定提前征召八万青年入伍，以便顶替正规军，使他们能够抽调到印度支那战场上去作战。
    无疑地，法国政府这种企图用法国青年的鲜血继续进行“肮脏的战争”的做法，将会激起成千成万法国母亲和妻子们的愤怒，也会引起全世界期望和平解决印度支那问题的人们的愤怒。然而，对于大西洋彼岸的美国垄断资本家说来，这却是一桩上好的消息。据路透社华盛顿五月二十九日电讯报道：法国政府“这一决定受到了（美国）国防部、国务院以及国会人士的欢迎，他们认为这是一种令人鼓舞的迹象，表明法国坚决反对姑息（应读作和平协商），并将继续打下去”。
    美国垄断资本家把法国“将继续打下去”的消息看成是“令人鼓舞的迹象”，这是不足为奇的，因为扩大印度支那战争正是华尔街日夜祈祷并且以很大的压力压迫法国政府去进行的事情，它的喉舌“华尔街日报”公开地说：“我们正站在比一九四九年更深重的经济下降的门坎……我们不知道任何新的刺激生产的办法，但是假如印度支那变成新的朝鲜，我们的经济就可以像一九五○年（按即朝鲜战争爆发的一年）那样重新上升”。
    事实也是这样，法国青年在印度支那流的鲜血，已使纽约交易所的股票价格不断上升。最近来自纽约的消息说，到五月八日为止，纽约股票市场中六十种股票的平均价格已上升到自一九三○年四月七日以来的新高峰。美国经济学家拜柏逊指出，目前美国股票上涨的原因，是由于“军事投机”，“是因为华尔街认为：我们将领导反对中国的战争，并以使用原子弹来作威胁。我们已在供给印度支那和法国飞机、武器和弹药等。”拜柏逊并且说，如果以协商的方法解决远东问题，股票价格就会下跌。
    因此，我们不难了解：为什么美国把大批的飞机、武器和弹药送到印度支那法国殖民军的手里，为什么美国不远千里为法国从国内空运兵员到印度支那去。原来华尔街的商人把倾注法国青年的鲜血看成是“刺激生产”的好办法！
    这样，拉尼埃政府决定再投一批赌注到侵略印度支那的战争中去，华尔街自然是“欢迎”的，“鼓舞”的。华尔街老板们仿佛看见更多的染满法国青年的鲜血的美元落到了自己的口袋里……
    然而，华尔街的“如意算盘”似乎是不怎么如意的。目前日内瓦会议在和平解决印度支那问题上已获得进展，双方司令部已准备讨论停止敌对行动问题的事实正说明了这一点。
