(Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 2nd) Kim Myung-gu, spokesman of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Geneva Conference, held a press conference here on the afternoon of the 2nd. At the press conference, he answered questions raised by reporters from various countries regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The following are questions raised by a reporter from the Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Rights." These questions encompass nearly all questions raised by other reporters.

Q: How can the peaceful development of Korea and non-interference in Korean internal affairs be guaranteed?

A: The third point of our proposal answers the question of guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that major powers can play a particularly significant role in this task. These countries should consult with each other and undertake certain obligations to prevent the recurrence of the Korean War, thereby guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. Representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have already stated their willingness to jointly undertake corresponding obligations with other countries to ensure the peaceful development of Korea. However, the United States opposes this. The opposition of the United States clearly demonstrates that the United States does not want a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

We believe that major powers undertaking certain international obligations toward Korea will not only guarantee the peaceful development of Korea but also make a great contribution to consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

As for guaranteeing non-interference by foreign countries, the primary issue is the withdrawal of foreign troops from the entire Korean territory. After the withdrawal of foreign troops, all-Korean elections should be held in a free environment without any external interference.

Our delegation still believes that the presence of foreign troops on Korean soil is incompatible with the execution of the task of holding free all-Korean elections and unifying the whole country on a democratic basis.

Q: What are the fundamental differences between Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal to establish a neutral nations supervisory commission to assist the All-Korean Committee in conducting all-Korean elections and to supervise the elections, and the proposal by Byun Young-tae to hold elections under United Nations supervision?

A: As the question itself indicates, there are obvious differences between the two. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal proceeds from the principle of not allowing any foreign interference in Korean internal affairs, while Byun Young-tae's proposal proceeds from a plan to allow the United States to interfere in Korean internal affairs without restriction. It should be remembered that international supervision of all-Korean elections does not violate the principle of resolving the Korean issue by the Koreans themselves. A committee composed of representatives of neutral nations is capable of assisting the All-Korean Committee to ensure that all-Korean elections are held in a situation where the Korean people can freely express their will. However, Byun Young-tae's proposal expresses an untenable objection. His proposal stipulates suppressing the free will of the entire Korean people under the military supervision of the United States. Supervision of all-Korean elections by the United Nations precisely means military supervision by the United States. The United States has seriously violated the Charter and principles of the United Nations, and has tried every possible means to use this international organization as its tool of aggression. No one can deny the fact that the United Nations was a belligerent party in the Korean War and signed the armistice agreement as a belligerent party. This is an undeniable concrete fact. This fact proves that the United Nations is irrelevant to the deliberation of the Korean issue, and this organization is no longer able to resolve the Korean issue. We cannot but conclude that, with U.S. troops remaining, UN supervision of elections would inevitably result in U.S. military supervision. Of course, Byun Young-tae, who complains that there is not enough U.S. interference, begs the U.S. military to continue to stay. But the Korean people will never agree to suggestions that allow foreign interference in their internal affairs.

Q: What do you think the recent elections to the South Korean National Assembly demonstrate?

A: It once again clearly demonstrates the anti-people nature of the elections held under the so-called United Nations supervision with the presence of U.S. armed interventionists. According to a Reuters dispatch from Seoul on May 21, a strange thing happened in Busan when counting the votes. Officials found a large pile of ballots in a ballot box that voted for Jang Gil-wan (transliteration), the Liberty Party candidate. It was revealed that these ballots were cast into the ballot box in stacks. However, the General Election Commission considered these ballots to be valid. The recent South Korean elections brought such results, proving that their proposal to hold elections under United Nations supervision is absurd. Yet, Byun Young-tae insists on such elections.

Q: What are the Korean people's expectations for the Geneva Conference?

A: The Korean people's expectations and concerns for the Geneva Conference are very deep. Koreans at home and abroad have expressed the same concern for the Geneva Conference.

Our delegation received a telegram from Korean residents in the Hawaiian Islands to the South Korean representative, which read as follows:

"Byun Young-tae: We hope that you will agree to a plan that allows the Korean people to decide their own destiny without foreign interference or the stench of colonialism and to unify the Korean people."

Every Korean is eagerly awaiting positive results from the Geneva Conference. Our delegation and the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are doing everything in our power to make the Geneva Conference a success.

However, due to the unreasonable demands and lack of sincerity on the part of the United States, the conference has encountered difficulties. The progress of the conference for more than a month clearly shows that the United States does not want a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. It is constantly trying to create difficulties for the discussion of the Korean issue.

    朝鲜代表团发言人举行记者招待会
    答复关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一些问题
    【新华社日内瓦二日电】参加日内瓦会议的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团发言人金明龟，二日下午在此间举行记者招待会。在招待会上，他答复了各国记者向代表团提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的一些问题。
    以下是捷克斯洛伐克报纸“红色权利报”记者提出的问题。这些问题差不多包括了其他记者所提出的所有问题。
    问：朝鲜的和平发展和外国不干涉朝鲜内政怎样才可以得到保证？
    答：我们的建议的第三点就对保证朝鲜的和平发展问题作了答复。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团认为，大国在这个任务上能够起特别重大的作用，这些国家彼此之间应进行协商，以承担一定的义务的方法防止朝鲜战争再起，来保证朝鲜的和平发展。苏联和中华人民共和国的代表已经表示，它们愿意和其他国家共同承担保障朝鲜和平发展的相应的义务。可是美国反对这个。美国的反对清楚地说明，美国不想和平解决朝鲜问题。
    我们认为，大国对朝鲜承担一定的国际义务，不仅将保证朝鲜的和平发展，而且对巩固亚洲和全世界的和平也有极大的贡献。
    至于保证外国不加干涉问题，这首先是从朝鲜全境撤出外国军队的问题。在外国军队撤出之后，应该在自由的环境中没有任何外来干涉地举行全朝鲜选举。
    我们代表团仍然认为：在朝鲜的土地上驻有外国军队是和执行举行全朝鲜自由选举以及在民主的基础上统一全国的任务不相容的。
    问：周恩来外长提出的关于成立中立国监察委员会以协助全朝鲜委员会进行全朝鲜选举的工作并对选举进行监察的建议和卞荣泰提出的在联合国监督下举行选举的建议，两者之间有什么基本区别？
    答：就像问题本身所显示的，两者之间有明显的区别。周恩来外长的建议是从不容许外国对朝鲜内政进行任何干涉的原则出发的，而卞荣泰的建议是从准许美国无限制地干涉朝鲜内政的计划出发的。应该记住的是：对全朝鲜选举实行国际监察并不违背朝鲜问题由朝鲜人自己解决的原则。由中立国代表组成的委员会是能够协助全朝鲜委员会使全朝鲜选举在朝鲜人民自由表达意志的情况下举行的。但是卞荣泰的建议表示了站不住脚的异议。他的建议规定了在美国的军事监督之下压制朝鲜全体人民的自由意志。联合国对全朝鲜选举的监督恰恰就是意味着美国的军事监督。美国严重地破坏了联合国的宪章和原则，千方百计地企图利用这个国际组织作为它的侵略工具。谁也不能否认这一事实：联合国是朝鲜战争中的交战的一方，并作为交战的一方在停战协定上签了字。这是无可否认的具体事实。这个事实证明：联合国是和朝鲜问题的审议无关的，这个机构已不能解决朝鲜问题。我们不能不得出结论：在美国军队驻留的情况下，联合国监督选举不可避免地会造成美国军队的军事监督。当然，抱怨美国干涉得还不够的卞荣泰，苦苦哀求美军继续留着。而朝鲜人民是永远不会同意容许外国干涉他们的内政的建议的。
    问：你以为最近举行的南朝鲜国会的选举说明了什么？
    答：它再一次清楚地说明了在美国武装干涉者驻留的情况下在所谓联合国监督之下举行的选举的反人民性质。据路透社五月二十一日汉城电，在计算选票的时候，在釜山传来了一件奇怪的事情。官员们在一个票箱中发现了一大堆选举自由党候选人张吉万（译音）的选票。据透露，这些选票是整叠地投进票箱去的。但是，普选委员会却认为这些选票是有效的。最近的南朝鲜选举带来了这样的结果：证明他们要在联合国监督下举行选举的建议是荒谬的。然而，卞荣泰却坚持这样的选举。
    问：朝鲜人民对日内瓦会议的期望如何？
    答：朝鲜人民对日内瓦会议的期望和关心是很深切的。国内和国外的朝鲜人对日内瓦会议表现了同样的关心。
    我们的代表团收到了夏威夷群岛朝鲜侨民打给南朝鲜代表的一个电报，电文如下：
      “卞荣泰：我们希望你同意准许朝鲜人民在毫无外来干涉或殖民主义气味的情况下决定自己的命运的、统一朝鲜人民的计划。”
    每一个朝鲜人都热切地期待着日内瓦会议获得积极的成果。我们的代表团和苏联及中华人民共和国的代表团竭尽全力，要使日内瓦会议胜利完成它的任务。
    但是，由于美国方面的无理要求和缺乏诚意，会议遭到了困难。一个多月以来会议的进程明显地表明：美国不想和平解决朝鲜问题。它不断地企图给朝鲜问题的讨论造成困难。
