Promote Street-Level Nurseries to Solve the Difficulties of Women Participating in Production
Li Jing

    With the progress of national economic construction, a vast number of women are actively participating in production and various construction works. Those who were originally able to raise their children themselves are now unable to do so. To adapt to this situation, in recent years, nurseries in many factories, government offices, organizations, and for various working women have developed rapidly. For example, with the total number of nurseries in December 1949 taken as 100, by the end of April this year, it had developed to over 1,300. These nursery organizations have indeed relieved a great deal of hardship for some female workers, enabling them to work and produce with peace of mind. However, these nursery organizations are still far from meeting actual needs. The number of children requesting admission each month and each season far exceeds the capacity of existing nurseries.
    Because the child problem is not resolved, many mothers have to lock their children at home during work hours to cry, or bring them to the workplace, or let them run around on the streets. This situation inevitably affects the safety of the children and the work of the mothers.
    What to do? The best solution is to organize street-level nurseries. Since 1952, 420 street-level nurseries have been established in 22 large and medium-sized cities across the country. These nurseries cost very little; each child generally only needs to pay tens of thousands of yuan per month. For those who go home for meals, only several thousand yuan per month are charged. In this way, many children who cannot find a nursery have a place to be cared for, enabling their mothers to work and produce with peace of mind. Wei Lianjie, a female employee of the Tianjin People's Bank, created the bank's highest record in counting banknotes after her child entered the nursery and was commended three times. Liu Bingru, a laboratory technician at Chongqing's Factory 501, used to be unable to get adequate rest after working night shifts because her child was noisy at home, resulting in poor spirit and low work efficiency during her shifts. After her child entered the nursery, she greatly improved her work efficiency. In the jurisdiction of the Nanjiang City Zhalanmen Residents' Committee, there were more than 30 households receiving relief. After the nursery was established, the mothers participated in production, increased their income, and no longer needed relief. In Beijing, more than 200 housewives participating in nursery work have improved their political understanding and ideological awareness by participating in collective undertakings, and have gradually acquired professional knowledge of childcare work, which has been welcomed by mothers and parents.
    However, when it comes to childcare work, some people still say, "The state will always take care of it in the future." Therefore, they hold a passive waiting attitude. This attitude is wrong. The state will increasingly take care of childcare work in the future, but at present, we must concentrate our efforts on industrial construction, and it is difficult to devote more attention to childcare work. Some people also think, "If we want to do it, we have to do it properly." This is also unrealistic. It is a good wish to require nurseries to be perfect and ideal, but we must act according to our capabilities and proceed step by step, without detaching ourselves from reality and engaging in empty fantasies. Although the nurseries we are running now are simpler, they can provide an initial solution to the current problems. It is actually impossible to have complete equipment and "standardization" from the beginning. Therefore, it must be affirmed that street-level nurseries are a practical and effective way to solve the problem of mothers taking care of their children after participating in production and work, and therefore should be actively promoted and popularized.
    The Yuanfuli Nursery in Tianjin's Third District initially organized a preparatory committee by the members of the Women's Representative Assembly and the leaders of the residents' groups, based on the needs of the mothers, and conducted extensive publicity to the masses through various opportunities and organizations, which gained the support of the masses and smoothly solved many problems of the nursery: A room for storing sundries was found, and the women representatives negotiated with the owner, who agreed to lend the nursery the room without compensation. The house was damp and had no windows. The plasterers and electricians among the masses automatically plastered the house and opened windows, turning it into a bright and tidy room. To establish this nursery, some old ladies lent out their unused bed boards, stoves, and iron pots; some old ladies sent small bowls and chopsticks. Some also sent bottles and jars for holding oil and salt to the nursery. A nearby doctor volunteered to examine the children and was responsible for the sanitation of the nursery. Some female activists with light housework and few children signed up to be nursery workers. The children also brought some small daily necessities themselves. In this way, a nursery was established with the active support of the masses. This can represent the situation of the establishment of nurseries in Tianjin and general cities.
    According to the experience of various regions, the general principles for smoothly running and operating nurseries are to rely on parents, rely on the masses, and rely on street-level activists.
    The leadership problem of the nurseries is solved by organizing a "Nursery Management Committee" in many areas. Its members are generally street-level activists, resident committee members, street women representatives, mother representatives, nursery worker representatives, etc. In addition, the city and district women's federations provide necessary assistance through grassroots women's organizations; government health departments and education departments provide certain professional guidance. Regarding the problem of nursery houses, many places have borrowed or rented from the masses based on mobilizing the masses. Chongqing, Nanjing, and other places have borrowed vacant houses from reading groups, literacy classes, mass night schools, etc., or borrowed or rented vacant rooms, halls, corridors, garages, temples, ancestral halls, etc. of residents. Regarding the equipment of the nurseries, the experience of many places is also to carry out donations, fundraising, and mutual assistance under the principle of the masses' voluntary participation, and then gradually purchase what is lacking. Other matters such as the method of consignment and the charging standards are determined according to the actual situation of the mothers.
    The First National Conference on Women and Children's Welfare Work of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation determined that childcare work must serve production, face the vast number of working women, give play to the wisdom of the masses of all strata, use the power of the masses, and use various forms to meet the needs of the masses. The establishment of street-level nurseries is precisely the implementation of this spirit. Women's organizations and other relevant departments in various regions should attach importance to the promotion of street-level nurseries, pay attention to summarizing and exchanging experiences, and do the work better.

    推广街道托儿站，解决妇女参加生产的困难
    李镜
    随着国家经济建设的进展，广大妇女积极参加了生产和各种建设工作，原来能够自己抚养孩子的，现在不能自己抚养了。为适应这种形势，几年来许多工厂、机关、团体和各种职业妇女托儿所有了迅速的发展。如以一九四九年十二月的托儿所总数为一百，到今年四月底已发展到一千三百以上。这些托儿组织确实为一部分女职工解除了很大困难，使她们得以安心生产，安心工作。但是这些托儿组织还远远赶不上实际的需要。每月、每季要求入所的孩子，远远超过现有托儿所的容量。
    由于孩子问题得不到解决，许多母亲在工作时间只得把孩子锁在家里任其哭闹，或带到工作地方，或任其在马路上乱跑。这种情形，不能不影响到孩子的安全和母亲的工作。
    怎么办呢？最好的办法就是组织街道托儿站。一九五二年以来，全国二十二个大中城市举办了四百二十个街道托儿站。这种托儿站费用极小，每个孩子一般只需要每月缴纳数万元。回家吃饭的，每月只缴数千元。这样，许多找不到托儿所的孩子就有了寄托处，使母亲们得以安心生产和工作。天津市人民银行女职员魏莲杰，在孩子入了托儿站以后，她在点钞票中创造了该行的最高纪录，受到三次表扬。重庆五○一厂化验室化验员刘冰如过去每逢值夜班以后，由于孩子在家吵闹，得不到充分休息，以致值班时精神不好，工作效率很低。孩子入了托儿站以后，她大大提高了工作效率。南京市栅栏门居民委员会辖区内有三十多家被救济户，在托儿站成立以后，母亲们参加了生产，增加了收入，就不再需要救济了。北京市有二百多位参加托儿站工作的家庭妇女，都因参加集体的事业而提高了政治认识和思想觉悟，并且渐渐地有了保育工作的业务知识，受到了母亲们和家长们的欢迎。
    可是一提起托儿工作，仍然有些人会说：“国家将来总是要办的。”因此他们抱着消极等待的态度。这种态度是错误的。国家将来会越来越多地照顾托儿工作，但目前必须集中力量进行工业建设，很难更多地照顾托儿工作。还有人想：“要办就要办得像样点。”这也是不切实际的。要求把托儿站办得完美，合乎理想，是好的愿望，但我们必须量力而行，一步一步地走，不能脱离实际去空想。现在我们举办的托儿站虽然简陋一些，但却可以使眼前的问题得到初步解决。想要一开始就设备完善，
  “标准化”，实际办不到。所以必须肯定：街道托儿站是解决母亲们参加生产、参加工作之后带孩子问题的实际而有效的办法，因此也就应该积极提倡和推广。
    天津市三区元福里托儿站，开始时是由妇女代表会委员和居民小组长们根据母亲的需要，组织了筹备委员会，通过各种机会、各种组织向群众进行了广泛的宣传，得到了群众的支持，顺利地解决了托儿站的许多问题：找到了一间堆杂物的房间，由妇女代表和房主协商，房主同意无代价借给托儿站。房子潮湿，没有窗户，群众中的泥水工人、电灯工人就自动地把房子粉刷过，开了窗户，结果变成了一间明亮而整洁的房子。为建立这个托儿站，有的老大娘把自己用不着的铺板、炉子、铁锅等借了出来；有的老大娘送来了小碗、筷子。有的把盛油盐的瓶子、罐子也送给了托儿站。附近的一位医生自愿给孩子们检查身体，负责托儿站的卫生工作。有些家务轻、孩子少的妇女积极分子报名做了托儿站的保育员。孩子们再自带一些日用的小东西。就这样，一个托儿站在群众积极支持下成立起来了。这可以代表天津市和一般城市托儿站成立的情况。
    根据各地经验，要顺利地举办托儿站和把托儿站办好，总的原则是依靠家长、依靠群众和依靠街道积极分子。
    托儿站的领导问题，许多地区是组织“托儿站管理委员会”解决的。其成员一般都是街道积极分子、居民委员、街妇女代表、妈妈代表、保育员代表等。另外，市、区妇联会通过基层妇女组织给以应有的协助；政府卫生部门、教育部门则给以一定的业务指导。托儿站的房子问题，不少地方是在发动群众的基础上，向群众借或者租。重庆、南京等地就曾经借用了读报组、识字班、群众夜校等的空房子，或借用、租用了居民的空房、厅堂、走廊、汽车间以及庙宇、祠堂等。托儿站的设备，不少地方的经验也是在群众自觉自愿的原则下进行捐助、筹借、互助解决，不足的再逐渐购置。其他如寄托办法、收费标准等，根据母亲的实际情况决定。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会第一次全国妇幼福利工作会议确定：保育工作必须为生产服务，面向广大劳动妇女，发挥各阶层群众的智慧，运用群众的力量，以多种多样的形式来满足群众的要求。街道托儿站的举办，正是贯彻了这种精神的。各地妇女组织和其他有关部门应该重视街道托儿站的推广工作，注意总结和交流经验，使工作做得更好。
