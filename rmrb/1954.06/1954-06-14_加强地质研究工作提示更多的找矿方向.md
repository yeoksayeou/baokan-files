Strengthening Geological Research to Suggest More Prospecting Directions
Hou Defeng, Director of the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Geological scientific research is an important component of geological work. In the past three years, China's geological scientific research work has accepted the guidance of advanced Soviet science and utilized various exploration data to carry out some work, enabling us to correctly understand some issues and propose some prospecting directions and bases, which have played a certain role in both prospecting and exploration work. For example, there are many copper deposits in China, but in the past, we couldn't discern which locations were promising and worth exploring. In previous years, some regions had carried out a lot of work with little success. Only after studying advanced Soviet geological science did we gradually recognize which types of deposits were promising, which were moderate, and which were unimportant. As a result, huge deposits were discovered in the Northwest, promising areas were explored in North China, and prospecting directions were pointed out for certain regions. Under the guidance of the theory of geotectonics, there have also been new and important gains in the search for coalfields in China. In particular, manganese ore has not received enough attention. As heavy industrial construction rapidly unfolded, with the increase in steel production, the demand for manganese greatly increased. But where to find enough manganese ore? In the spring of 1953, we first studied the properties of manganese element based on advanced Soviet theories, conducted experiments, and then went to the field to observe and collect practical materials. We affirmed the importance of sedimentary manganese deposits and confirmed that several manganese ore areas in China were sedimentary deposits, expanding the manganese ore prospecting in these mining areas, finding new mining areas and new ore layers, and opening up the path of manganese ore exploration in our country.

This year, China will launch large-scale geological prospecting work to conduct multi-faceted surveys and understanding of underground mineral resources in the vast territory. This large-scale prospecting work will, on the one hand, provide abundant practical materials for geological scientific research, thereby improving the level of Chinese geological scientific research and deriving geological scientific theories that conform to China's natural facts; on the other hand, such a large-scale prospecting work, organizing such a large team to prospect and find minerals in such a wide area, requires geological scientific research to suggest more prospecting directions and solve various theoretical problems in prospecting and mineral exploration. Therefore, strengthening geological scientific research is a very important task at present.

In order to strengthen geological scientific research, efforts need to be made in several aspects. First, we must strengthen the view of geological workers to seek welfare for the people, that is, the overall view of serving the national interest. Only by establishing such a basic view can we correctly understand and solve problems, and can we promote the further development of geological science. In the past three years, Chinese geological workers have made basic changes and progress in their understanding of this aspect, but in the rapid development of large-scale socialist construction, it is necessary to further improve their ideological and political level. In the past, when investigating copper, molybdenum and nickel were ignored; only mineral exploration was considered, neglecting hydrogeology or other factors; only the task of exploration footage was emphasized, ignoring the nature of the ore deposit; when collecting specimens, only the ore body was considered, ignoring the surrounding rock; only familiar locations were emphasized, ignoring the currently urgently needed industrial areas, etc., are all one-sided understandings that must be overcome.

Second, we must truthfully and comprehensively collect materials and conduct in-depth identification, analysis, and research on practical materials. Only by strengthening this step of work can we further understand and comprehend nature; scratching the surface and swallowing dates whole cannot solve problems. For example, last year's research on a certain refractory material was carried out through mineral identification, electron microscope observation, experiments on physical properties, and coordination with mass production trials by industrial departments. As a result, the properties of the ore were understood, and it was proven that this refractory material has a wide range of application values, making seventy percent of the abandoned ore sand usable. In front of our geological workers, there are still many topics to be solved. For example, there are many oil shale producing areas in China, but none have been well identified and studied, requiring our continuous efforts.

Third, learn from the Soviet Union and establish correct scientific theories. When the prospecting team unfolds its work, it will encounter complex geological phenomena. What should be taken and what should be recorded? When the work is completed, how should tens of thousands of specimens and boxes of records be analyzed and summarized? This requires theoretical guidance. A manganese mining area that has been mined for decades has undergone several geological surveys, but no clear explanation of the deposit has been made. Last year, the mining department believed that the surface ore was about to be exhausted. Recently, based on Soviet geological science theory, the mineralization law of the surface deposit was recognized, and the existence of the primary ore layer was confirmed, confirming that the mining area still has prospects for exploitation. This clearly illustrates the importance of theoretical guidance. The level of our Chinese geological science is still relatively low, and we cannot make clear conclusions on some geological issues in China. We should and must solve such a key problem, that is, learning from the Soviet Union and deeply identifying and studying China's actual materials, and gradually summarizing the theory of Chinese geological science.

Finally, we must strengthen organizational ties, cultivate research forces, and support prospecting and resource exploration work. The purpose of prospecting is clear, and the purpose of research work is also clear. The problem is that research work should have a certain arrangement. What methods should be used for which type of problem? It is especially important that research work should be well organized. Various research institutions should separately or jointly undertake some work. At present, the research force is indeed very weak, but strengthening organizational ties can play a greater role. For example, in the research of refractory clay, the research institutions of the production department can test its fire resistance, plasticity, thermal expansion coefficient, etc., but cannot test what mineral properties and existing structures make it exhibit this property; the latter part of the work can be done by the Geological Institute. Many practical problems are like this, and joint efforts can solve them smoothly.

The Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is strengthening this aspect of work, uniting with various production departments and schools. We are willing to make our best efforts to expand the effect of the prospecting team in a timely manner.

    加强地质研究工作提示更多的找矿方向
    中国科学院地质研究所所长　侯德封
    地质科学研究工作是地质工作的一个重要组成部分。近三年来，我国地质科学研究工作接受了苏联先进科学的指导，利用了各种勘探资料，作了一些工作，使我们正确地认识了一些问题，提出了一些找矿的方向和根据，对普查和勘探工作都起了一定的作用。例如中国铜矿的产地很多，但是那个地点有希望，值得勘探，我们在过去看不出门道。前几年，有的地区曾进行了很多工作，收获并不大。学习了苏联先进的地质科学，才逐渐认识了那一种矿床类型是有希望的，那一种是中等的，那一种是不重要的，因而在西北探明了巨大的矿床，在华北探勘了有希望的地区，对某些地区也指出了找矿的方向。根据大地构造理论的指导，对寻找中国的煤田也有新的重要收获。特别是锰矿，一向注意不够，当重工业建设迅速展开时，随着钢铁产量的提高，锰的需要量大大增加。可是，到那里去找足够的锰矿呢？一九五三年春天，我们首先根据苏联的先进理论，研究了锰元素的性质，作了实验，又到野外观察，搜集实际材料，肯定水成锰矿的重要性，并肯定中国的几个锰矿区是水成矿床，扩大了这些矿区的锰矿普查，找到了新的矿区和新的矿层，开辟了我国锰矿勘探的道路。
    今年我国要开展大规模的地质普查工作，对广大国土的地下矿产进行多方面的调查了解。这个规模巨大的普查工作，一方面将为地质科学研究工作提供丰富的实际材料，从而提高中国地质科学研究工作的水平，得出合于中国自然事实的地质科学理论；另一方面，这样一个规模巨大的普查工作，组织这样大的队伍到这样广的地区去普查找矿，又要求地质科学研究工作提示更多的找矿方向和解决普查找矿中的各种理论问题。因此，加强地质科学研究工作，是当前一个十分重要的任务。
    为了加强地质科学研究工作，需要从几方面来努力。首先要加强地质工作者为人民谋福利的观点，也即是服从国家利益的整体观点。树立这样一个基本观点，才能正确地认识问题和解决问题，才能促进地质科学的进一步发展。中国的地质工作者近三年来对这一方面的认识是有了基本的改变和进步的，但在大规模社会主义建设的迅速发展中，还需进一步提高思想水平与政治水平。过去调查铜就不管钼、镍；只顾找矿而忘了注意水文地质或其他；只顾完成探矿进尺任务，不注意矿床性质；采标本只管矿体不管围岩；只强调自己熟悉的地点而不管目前迫切需要的工业区等等，都是片面的认识，必须克服。
    第二、要真实地、全面地收集材料和对实际材料进行深入的鉴别、分析、研究。只有加强这一步工作，才能进一步认识和理解自然界；擦皮搔痒、囫囵吞枣是不能解决问题的。例如去年对某种耐火材料的研究，是通过矿物鉴定、电子显微镜观察、物理性质的实验和产业部门大量生产试验配合进行的。结果认识了矿石的性质。证明了这种耐火材料有广泛应用的价值，使百分之七十的遗弃矿砂得到利用。在我们地质工作者的面前，还有许多课题尚待解决，例如中国油页岩产地很多，但都没有进行很好的鉴别研究，需要我们作不断的努力。
    第三、学习苏联，建立正确的科学理论。当普查队展开工作的时候，要遇到繁复的地质现象，采取什么又记录什么？工作结束的时候，上万的标本，成箱的记录，又怎样分析总结？这需要理论的指导。有一个开采数十年的锰矿区，曾经过几次地质调查，但没有能对矿床作出明确的解释，去年采矿部门认为地表矿石即将采完，最近根据苏联的地质科学理论，才认识了地表矿床的成矿规律，并且证实了原生矿层的存在，证实了这个矿区还是有开采前途的。这清楚地说明理论指导的重要性。我们中国地质科学的水平还比较低，对中国地质上一些问题还不能都做出明确的结论。我们应当，也必须解决这样一个关键问题，那就是学习苏联和深入鉴别、研究中国的实际材料，逐步地总结出中国地质科学的理论。
    最后，要加强组织联系，培养研究力量，支持普查和资源勘探工作。普查的目的是明确的，研究工作的目的也是明确的。问题是研究工作应当有一定的布置。属于哪一类问题应该采用什么方法来进行。特别重要的是研究工作应该很好地组织。各研究机构应分别或联合担任一些工作。目前研究力量的确很薄弱，但加强组织联系是可以发挥更大作用的。例如耐火粘土的研究，生产部门的研究机构可以试验它的耐火度，可塑性、热膨胀系数等，而不能试验因为什么矿物性质和存在结构使它表现这种性质；后一部分工作是地质研究所可以作的。许多实际问题都是这样，联合起来就可以顺利解决。
    中国科学院地质研究所正在加强这方面的工作，同各生产部门和学校联合起来。我们愿尽最大的努力，使普查工作队及时地扩展效果。
