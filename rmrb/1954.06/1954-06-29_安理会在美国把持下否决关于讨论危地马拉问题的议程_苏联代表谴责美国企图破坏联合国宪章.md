(Xinhua News Agency, June 28th) According to TASS, New York: The Security Council held a meeting on the 25th. This Security Council meeting was convened under the blatant opposition of the U.S. delegation.

The agenda submitted for the meeting's approval included the complaint by the Guatemalan Foreign Minister requesting the cessation of armed aggression against Guatemala. During the meeting, those opposed to stopping the aggression against Guatemala created fierce debate when approving the meeting's agenda. The Brazilian representative opposed the approval of the proposed Security Council agenda to discuss the Guatemalan issue, using the excuse that the Organization of American States was "handling" the Guatemala issue. However, it is well known that the Guatemalan government opposes its complaint being discussed by this organization. Because the Brazilian representative essentially began discussing the issue before the agenda was approved, Soviet representative Tsarapkin opposed passing important resolutions on the Guatemala issue without the participation of the representative of the nation suffering aggression. The Soviet representative suggested inviting the Guatemalan representative to participate in the discussion of this issue in accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter.

U.S. Representative Lodge said that he, in his capacity as chairman, ruled against inviting the Guatemalan representative to the Security Council. He believed that only after the Security Council approved the agenda could the Guatemalan representative be invited to attend the Security Council meeting. The Soviet representative opposed the chairman's ruling and demanded that the UN Charter be followed. The U.S. representative, acting as chairman, disregarded the Soviet representative's opposition and flagrantly violated the provisions of the UN Charter by insisting in his ruling against inviting the Guatemalan representative.

Subsequently, the representatives of Colombia, Turkey, and the Kuomintang spoke. They all declared that they would vote against the adoption of the preliminary agenda. The British and French representatives said that they would abstain from voting on this issue. They admitted that the Security Council should not ignore the situation in Guatemala, but they insisted that the Security Council should discuss the Guatemala issue only after receiving supplementary materials regarding the situation in Guatemala. They said that such materials could be provided to the Security Council by the Organization of American States after reviewing the Guatemala issue.

Representatives of some council members opposed this unjust and essentially illegal position that undermined the UN Charter. The representatives of Lebanon, Denmark, and New Zealand expressed their support for adopting the preliminary agenda. The Lebanese representative emphasized that refusing to include a UN member's request to include its complaint on the agenda would be incorrect and would jeopardize the Security Council's prestige and dignity. The Security Council cannot evade its primary responsibility for maintaining peace and international security.

The Soviet representative spoke in favor of adopting the agenda. The Soviet representative emphasized that behind the effort to transfer the Guatemala issue to the Organization of American States under various pretexts lies another conspiracy: to undermine the UN Charter and to further undermine the prestige and role of the Security Council as the primary body for maintaining peace and international security. Tsarapkin said that the Soviet delegation firmly opposes these conspiracies and will vote in favor of approving the agenda.

U.S. Representative Lodge opposed the adoption of the preliminary agenda, hinting in a threatening tone that the United States regards Latin America as its hereditary territory and would not allow the Security Council to consider the issue of aggression on the American continent. He implied that otherwise, the United States would cause the United Nations to collapse.

Finally, the Security Council voted on the proposal to approve the preliminary agenda. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Lebanon, Denmark, and New Zealand voted in favor of approval. The representatives of the United States, Brazil, Colombia, Turkey, and the Kuomintang voted against. The representatives of Britain and France abstained.

Therefore, the agenda of the Security Council meeting was rejected by only one vote.

    安理会在美国把持下否决关于讨论危地马拉问题的议程
    苏联代表谴责美国企图破坏联合国宪章
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：安全理事会二十五日举行了会议。这次安理会会议是在美国代表团的露骨的反对下召开的。
    在提交会议批准的议程中列有危地马拉外长提出的要求制止对危地马拉的武装侵略的控诉。在会议进行中，反对制止对危地马拉的侵略的人们在批准会议议程时制造了激烈的讨论。巴西代表反对批准建议中的讨论危地马拉问题的安理会议程。借口说美洲国家组织正在“处理”危地马拉问题。但是大家都知道危地马拉政府是反对由这一组织讨论它的控诉的。由于巴西代表在未批准议程以前就实质上开始讨论这一问题，苏联代表查拉普金反对在没有遭受侵略的国家的代表的参加下，就危地马拉问题通过重要的决定。苏联代表建议按照联合国宪章的规定，邀请危地马拉代表参加这一问题的讨论。
    美国代表洛奇说，他以主席的身份裁决不邀请危地马拉代表到安理会来。他认为要待安理会批准议程后，才能邀请危地马拉代表出席安理会会议。苏联代表反对主席的裁决，并要求按联合国宪章办事。担任主席的美国代表不顾苏联代表的反对，粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章的规定，竟在裁决时坚持不邀请危地马拉代表。
    随后由哥伦比亚、土耳其代表和国民党分子发言。他们都声言将投票反对通过初步议程。英国和法国代表说，他们将在就这一问题表决时弃权。他们承认，安理会不应对危地马拉的局势置之不理，但是他们硬说，在安理会讨论危地马拉问题应在获得了关于危地马拉局势的补充材料之后才行。并说，这种材料可由美洲国家组织在审查危地马拉问题之后向安理会提供。
    有些理事国代表反对这种不公正的而且实质上是非法的、破坏联合国宪章的立场。黎巴嫩、丹麦和新西兰代表表示赞成通过初步议程。黎巴嫩代表强调说，拒绝把联合国会员国请求把它的控诉列入议程的要求，将是不正确的，并且将危及安理会的威信和尊严。安理会不能规避维持和平和国际安全的主要职责。
    苏联代表发言主张通过议程。苏联代表强调指出，力图在各种借口之下把危地马拉问题转交给美洲国家组织的这种努力后面，隐藏着另一种阴谋，即：要破坏联合国宪章，要更加破坏作为在维持和平和国际安全的主要机构的安理会的威信和作用。查拉普金说，苏联代表团坚决反对这些阴谋，并将投票赞成批准议程。
    美国代表洛奇反对通过初步议程，以威胁的口吻暗示美国把拉丁美洲看作自己的世袭领地，它不让安理会考虑关于美洲大陆上的侵略问题。他暗示说，否则，美国就要使联合国垮台。
    最后安理会就关于批准初步议程的提案进行表决。投票赞成批准的有苏联、黎巴嫩、丹麦和新西兰的代表。美国、巴西、哥伦比亚、土耳其的代表和国民党分子投票反对。英国和法国的代表弃权。
    因此，安理会会议的议程仅以一票之差遭到否决。
