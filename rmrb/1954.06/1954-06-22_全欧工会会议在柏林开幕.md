Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: The Pan-European Trade Union Conference opened on June 20th in the People's Chamber Hall of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin. Many guests from Asian, Latin American, and African countries attended. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, also attended the conference. Herbert Warnke, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, presided over the opening of the conference on behalf of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    Warnke emphasized that the task of the conference was to discuss the role and tasks of trade unions in safeguarding peace and improving the living standards of the working people. Warnke said that the Pan-European Trade Union Conference would help the unity of the working class, help strengthen the struggle for peace, for the establishment of a European collective security system, and for the improvement of the living conditions of the working people.

    Subsequently, the conference elected a presidium, which included Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions; Herbert Warnke, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation; Alain Le Leap, Vice-Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of France; and Shevchenko, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, among others.

    The following agenda was unanimously adopted by the attendees: Louis Saillant's report on "The role and tasks of trade unions in the struggle to establish peaceful relations between European countries, to strive for genuine guarantees of security, to fight for peace, and to improve the living standards of the working people." Following this, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the report.

    After Saillant's report, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, spoke. Grotewohl congratulated the conference on behalf of the government and all the working people of the German Democratic Republic. He believed that this conference, attended by representatives from thirty-one European countries, would speak with weight in the cause of defending peace and the security of the peoples of Europe.

    Grotewohl then said that the regime of the German Democratic Republic already belongs to the workers and peasants, and the people decide everything. Our trade unions and the government are not opposed to each other, but cooperate closely like friends, but in capitalist countries, they are opposed to each other.

    Grotewohl emphasized that the "European Defense Community" treaty is not only a threat to the German people, but also a threat to the peoples of European countries. Therefore, we should do our best to abolish this treaty so that we can establish a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany. This can only be achieved under the condition of guaranteeing European collective security.

    Grotewohl emphasized that the German Democratic Republic is ready to be among the first to participate in the all-European treaty to guarantee European collective security.

    After Grotewohl finished speaking, the conference began to discuss Louis Saillant's report.

    全欧工会会议在柏林开幕
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十日讯：全欧工会会议六月二十日在柏林德意志民主共和国人民议院大厅开幕。到会者中有许多来自亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲国家的宾客。德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥也参加了会议。世界工会联合会副主席、自由德国工会联合会主席赫伯特·瓦恩克代表世界工联执行局主持会议开幕。
    瓦恩克强调指出，会议的任务是要讨论工会在保障和平与提高劳动人民的生活水平的事业中的作用和任务。瓦恩克说，全欧工会会议将有助于工人阶级的团结、有助于加强为和平、为建立欧洲集体安全体系和为改善劳动人民的生活状况而斗争。
    接着，会议选出了主席团，其中有世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬，世界工会联合会副主席、自由德国工会联合会主席赫伯特·瓦恩克，世界工会联合会副主席、法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普，全苏工会中央理事会书记谢夫钦科等人。
    到会者一致通过了下列议程：路易·赛扬报告“工会在争取欧洲各国之间建立和平关系、争取安全的真正保证、争取和平和争取劳动人民生活水平提高的斗争中的作用和任务”。接着，世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬做报告。
    赛扬报告之后，德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥讲话。格罗提渥代表德意志民主共和国政府和全体劳动人民向大会祝贺。他相信，欧洲三十一个国家代表参加的这次会议，在保卫和平和欧洲各国人民的安全的事业上会说出有份量的话。
    格罗提渥接着说道，德意志民主共和国的政权已属于工人和农民，人民决定一切。我们的工会和政府不是互相对立的，而是像朋友一样地密切合作，但在资本主义国家，它们是互相对立的。
    格罗提渥着重指出，“欧洲防务集团”条约不仅是对德国人民的威胁，而且是对欧洲各国人民的威胁。因此，我们应该尽最大努力来取消这一条约，以便能建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国。只有在保障欧洲集体安全的条件下才能做到这一点。
    格罗提渥着重指出，德意志民主共和国准备在第一批参加保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约。
    格罗提渥讲完后，会议开始讨论路易·赛扬的报告。
