    Extensive Propaganda and Discussion of the Draft Constitution Unfolds in Four Provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Cities such as Xi'an, Shenyang, and Anshan
    The activities of propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces have penetrated into some special districts, autonomous regions, counties, and cities.
    In Yulin Special District of Shaanxi Province, about 300 reporters and propagandists trained by various counties are about to go to various places to carry out propaganda to the broad masses. In Weinan Special District, the discussion of the Draft Constitution will be one of the main contents of the upcoming People's Congress meetings, and people's representatives will be organized to report to the masses and organize mass discussions. Eighty-nine reporters and propagandists trained in Hanzhong City will soon be able to start propaganda. Fifty-seven blackboard newspapers and eight radio stations in the city have published or broadcast news about the propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution. Reading groups distributed in urban and suburban areas use work or production breaks to organize discussions on the Draft Constitution.
    In Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region, and Tianshui, Jiuquan, and other special districts and their subordinate counties in Gansu Province, the Draft Constitution Discussion Committees have formulated specific plans to launch propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution among the masses. Counties in Wuwei County have successively convened representatives' meetings of propagandists to discuss the propaganda of the Draft Constitution.
    The provincial-level reporters in Ningxia Province set off on the 21st to report on the Draft Constitution to the reporters, propagandists, and cadres of autonomous regions, counties, and cities throughout the province, and to assist the local Draft Constitution Discussion Committees in their work. Cadres in various parts of the Hedong Hui Autonomous Region are nearing the end of reading and discussing the "Preface" section of the Draft Constitution and are about to begin discussing the "General Principles." More than 310 reporters and propagandists trained in Jinji, Lingwu, and Wuzhong counties and cities in the agricultural area will depart successively after the 25th to carry out propaganda to farmers during production breaks. Some propagandists in Tongxin County in the semi-pastoral area have also gone deep into some districts and townships to start propaganda and organize discussions.
    The Draft Constitution Discussion Committees of various autonomous regions and counties and cities in Qinghai Province have been established successively since the 13th, and now most of them have begun to train propagandists. The Huzhu Tu Autonomous County has also decided to establish Draft Constitution discussion groups in various districts to specifically organize district and township cadres to discuss and publicize to the masses.

    The activities of propaganda and discussion of the Draft Constitution in Xi'an City have been universally launched among the people of all walks of life. Thirty-two branches of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, including districts, federations of trade unions, major factories, universities and colleges, ethnic minorities, and industrial and commercial circles in Xi'an City, have been established successively. Most of the more than 10,000 reporters, propagandists, and grassroots cadres in the streets of the city have started propaganda activities after being trained. The reporting group of the Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, composed of 28 full-time cadres transferred from various units, has also gone to various districts and factories to make reports. Now, the radio stations, reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and wall newspapers of factories and construction sites throughout the city mainly introduce the Draft Constitution or publish articles related to the Draft Constitution. People's representatives, workers, youths, women, and industrialists and businessmen in the Second District have successively held seven symposiums. The seven spare-time cultural schools in the Fifth District have also been teaching the Draft Constitution during political classes since the 20th. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The work of discussing the Draft Constitution in Shenyang and Anshan is gradually unfolding. Seventeen branches of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee have been established in Shenyang City; at the same time, more than 100 units in the city have established organizations to discuss the Draft Constitution. Tiexi District is training street propagandists and activists, and will adopt the method of reporters and propagandists contracting areas to carry out propaganda to residents. In addition to conducting propaganda and organizing discussions among the workers of their own factories, the factories in Tiexi District also plan to transfer some reporters and propagandists to conduct propaganda to the family members of the workers, and to lead the family members of the workers to conduct discussions. Shenhe District plans to first convene representatives of workers, women, youth, and other aspects to discuss the content of the Draft Constitution in order to prepare for the development of discussions in the entire district. In terms of ethnic minorities, they have been divided into three groups according to Hui, Korean, and Mongolian nationalities, and the discussion dates have been determined. Some factories in the city have initially launched propaganda activities. The Fifty-Three Factory, Smelting Plant, Water Pump Factory, Heavy Machinery Factory and other units have trained reporters and propagandists. The Water Pump Factory and Heavy Machinery Factory also held general meetings of all employees to report on the significance of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution and the basic content of the Draft Constitution. The reporter of the Huanggu Tun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has made a report to the workers on the Draft Constitution. The Shenyang Gunny Bag Factory also began to train reporters and propagandists from the 19th, and is about to launch propaganda and discussion activities.
    In the steel capital of Anshan, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a report on the Draft Constitution to more than 1,700 responsible cadres, reporters, and worker political instructors of the city's various organs, groups, factories, mines, and basic construction units. More than 400 people in the propaganda team and 3,000 propagandists composed of cadres from various organs, groups, factories, and mines will go deep into various factories, mines, urban areas, and suburbs after training to publicize the Draft Constitution to workers, workers' families, farmers, and urban residents, and help with small-scale seminars and discussions. More than 30,000 cadres, engineering technicians, and staff members who originally participated in political theory studies have begun to use their usual theory study time to read the Draft Constitution. The first meeting of the Anshan Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, held on the 21st, stipulated that when conducting propaganda and discussion among the broad masses of workers, attention should be paid to closely combining production, deeply developing technical innovation and labor emulation movement, and mobilizing workers to support the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with actions to fully complete and overfulfill steel production tasks.
