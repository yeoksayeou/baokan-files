Construction workers in the Central-South region have created advanced construction experiences. Workers in various parts of Central-South China have learned Su Changyou's advanced bricklaying method, Xie Wanfu's advanced carpentry operation method, and Yang Dezhong's advanced plastering operation method, and have achieved results. They have also created and improved a variety of advanced tools, which greatly improved work efficiency. Employees of the Wuhan Construction Company recently created an automatic bricklaying machine. As long as two and a half workers (one technician and three young workers) operate it, they can lay 16,200 bricks in nine hours a day, which is five and a half times higher than ordinary manual bricklaying. Workers of the First Construction Engineering Company of Central-South China use a self-made mortar spreader, squeezing the mortar with both hands, and each worker can also lay 5,500 bricks per day. Employees of the company created a plaster spraying machine, which can increase work efficiency by fifteen times compared to ordinary manual spraying, and can guarantee quality. The woodworking drilling machine created by construction workers in Guangdong Province can drill four to eight square window holes at the same time, which can be completed in 56 seconds. According to the measurement of one window hole, the work efficiency is six times higher than manual drilling. Workers in Guangzhou created a tool for installing copper screens, which can be installed completely without nails by pressing and plugging. The quality is very good, and ordinary young workers can install it. Carpenters from several construction sites in Guangxi, Henan and Guangzhou use universal scribing machines, which increase work efficiency by eight to twelve times compared to ordinary manual scribing. The Third Construction Team of Jiangxi Construction Company uses prefabricated brick walls, and the construction site of China Tea Company in Hunan Province uses movable awnings to solve the difficulties of construction in the rainy season and has achieved successful experience.
In order to exchange advanced experience in building construction, the Central-South Region will hold an advanced experience observation and promotion conference for building engineering in Wuhan in late June.

    中南区建筑工人创造先进施工经验
    中南区各地建筑工人，创造先进施工经验。中南各地职工学习苏长有砌砖先进操作法、谢万福木工作业先进操作法和杨德重粉刷作业先进操作法，取得了成绩，并且创造和改进了多种先进工具，使工作效率大大提高。武汉市修建公司职工最近创制了自动砌砖器，只要两个半工（一个技工和三个青工）操作，每天九小时就可砌砖一万六千二百块，比一般人工砌砖提高工作效率五倍半。中南第一建筑工程公司工人采用自制的铺灰器，用双手挤浆，每个工每天也能砌砖五千五百块。该公司职工创制粉刷喷粉器，比一般人工喷粉可提高工作效率十五倍，并能保证质量。广东省的建筑工人们创制的木工钻眼机，每次可同时钻四个至八个方形窗眼，五十六秒钟即可完成。按一个窗眼来测定，比手工钻眼提高工作效率六倍。广州市工人创制了安装铜纱窗的工具，可以完全不用钉子，以压塞办法安装，质量很好，一般青工即可安装。广西、河南及广州市若干建筑工地的木工，使用万能划线机，比一般手工划线提高工作效率八倍至十二倍。江西省修建公司第三施工所使用预制砖墙和湖南省中国茶业公司工地用活动雨棚，解决雨季施工困难，已取得成功的经验。
    为交流建筑施工的先进经验，中南区将于六月下旬在武汉举办建筑工程先进经验观摩推广大会。
