Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th.  Jianghai intermodal transport has been implemented in many ports along the Yangtze River and major ports north of Ningbo on the coast of our country. In May, goods jointly transported by Yangtze River and sea vessels could fill over a thousand railway cars if transported by rail.  In June, the volume of goods transported by Jianghai intermodal transport will increase by 70% compared to May. This will greatly reduce the burden on land transportation, especially railway transportation.

Jianghai intermodal transport includes many coastal ports and ten ports along the Yangtze River, including Nanjing, Huangshi, Hankou, and Chongqing. Intermodal transport has further promoted the exchange of goods between provinces on both sides of the Yangtze River and coastal areas. In May, edible salt and aquatic products from the East China coast, as well as hardware and machinery from the Northeast region, were continuously transported to various provinces along the Yangtze River through intermodal transport; abundant grain from both sides of the Yangtze River and asbestos from Xikang were also transported eastward along the Yangtze River to coastal ports. At the same time, as inland river lines along the Yangtze River in Hunan and Anhui provinces and various ports along the Yangtze River have implemented intermodal transport, inland river routes extending to the vast rural areas of Hunan and Anhui provinces have also been connected to the long coastal routes.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Kutu-to-Tulihe section of the railway, which started construction last year in the Greater Khingan Range forest area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, officially opened to traffic on May 21. A passenger train directly from Qiqihar Station arrived at Tulihe Station on schedule at 1:40 pm that day.

This section of the railway is 71 kilometers long. The railway has to pass through undulating mountains and many swampy areas covered with tussock grass. In the past, when Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, it attempted to plunder the timber from the Sanhe forest area, but could not build a railway leading to the forest area. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, workers in the new China completed the construction of this section of railway in only one year and two months. The opening of this railway will promote the construction of the forestry industry and cultural development in the Inner Mongolia forest area, and connect new forest areas such as Tulihe and Xiniqi with major cities across the country. A large amount of timber can be directly transported to all parts of the country through this transportation line to support basic construction.

On the day the Kutu section of the railway officially opened to traffic, the employees of the Tulihe forest area greeted the first passenger train arriving in Tulihe at the station with particularly excited hearts. The employees congratulated each other, saying: We have finally waited for the passenger train. The forest area will be built even more beautifully in the future. Let us produce well.

    长江沿线和沿海许多港口实行江海联运
    大兴安岭森林区库图段铁路正式通车
   【新华社武汉八日电】长江沿线和我国沿海宁波以北的主要港口已实行江海联运。五月份由长江和海上船舶联运的物资，如果由铁路运输，可以装满上千个火车车皮。六月份江海联运的物资又将比五月份增加百分之七十。这样就大大减轻了陆上交通特别是铁路运输的负担。
    江海联运包括沿海许多港口和长江沿线的南京、黄石市、汉口、重庆等十个港口。联运已使长江两岸各省和沿海地区的物资交流进一步地开展起来。五月份，华东沿海的食盐、水产和东北地区的五金器材、机器，经过联运已源源地运到长江沿线各省；长江两岸丰富的粮食和西康的石棉等，也都沿着长江东下转运到沿海各港。同时，由于湖南、安徽两省内河沿线和长江各港已实行联运，伸延到湖南、安徽两省广大农村的内河航线也已和漫长的沿海航线联系起来了。
   【本报讯】内蒙古自治区大兴安岭森林里去年动工修筑的库都尔至图里河段铁路，已在五月二十一日正式通车。由齐齐哈尔站直接开往图里河的旅客列车在当天下午一点四十分正点到达图里河车站。
    这段铁路全长七十一公里。铁路要通过峰峦起伏的山岭和很多长着塔头草的泥沼地带。过去日本帝国主义侵占我国东北时，曾企图掠夺三河林区的木材，但没有办法修通一条通往林区的铁路。在共产党领导下的新中国的工人，仅用一年零两个月的时间就把这段铁路修筑成功了。这段铁路的通车，将促进内蒙古森林工业建设和林区的文化建设，并使图里河、西尼气等新林区与全国各大城市连接起来，大批木材可以经过这条运输线直接运送到全国各地去支援基本建设。
    库图段铁路正式通车这天，图里河林区职工怀着特别兴奋的心情，到车站迎接这第一次开到图里河的旅客列车。职工们互相庆贺着说：我们可把旅客列车盼来了，以后林区要建设得更美了，我们好好生产吧。
