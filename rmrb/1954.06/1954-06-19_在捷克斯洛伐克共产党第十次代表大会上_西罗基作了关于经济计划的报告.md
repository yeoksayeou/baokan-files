At the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
    Siroky Delivers Report on Economic Plan

At the 13th session of the Tenth Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Siroky delivered a report on the fourth item on the agenda, "Instructions on the 1955 National Economic Development Plan and the Short-Term Plan to Greatly Increase Agricultural Production in the Next Two to Three Years."

Siroky emphasized that the purpose of the draft instructions mentioned above is to improve the people's living standards in accordance with the basic economic laws of socialism.

Siroky said that the Czechoslovak Republic has followed the example of the Soviet Union and embarked on the road of socialist construction. The Czechoslovak working people have learned from the Soviet Union the most advanced and progressive methods and means of national economic work and planning. Siroky emphasized the great significance of the industrial raw materials and food supplied by the Soviet Union, as well as orders for shipbuilding, boilers, and complex electrical machinery for Czechoslovakia.

Siroky said that the development of the economic base and the significant improvement of the living conditions of the working people have consolidated our people's democratic state and the political foundation of our system – the alliance of the working class and the working peasants. The Czechoslovak working people – workers, peasants, and intellectuals – have united more closely and inextricably around the Communist Party and the National Front government to jointly build socialism. In the process of completing the Five-Year Plan, our country's economic strength has been greatly strengthened, and its international prestige has been greatly enhanced.

However, the shortcomings in our work, especially the backwardness in the basic sectors of our economy, namely, the great backwardness of agricultural production, have become a serious obstacle to our continued progress. Siroky pointed out that the following basic tasks must be accomplished without delay to ensure the balanced development of the national economy: First, due to increasing demands, agricultural output must be greatly increased in the near future in order to supply the people with a sufficient amount of food, especially meat, and to supply raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

Second, the equipment for coal mining, power generation, and mining must be expanded rapidly and effectively to ensure the development of industry and other sectors of the national economy, and to improve the supply to residents;

Third, increase the production of consumer goods and improve the quality of consumer goods;

Fourth, greatly improve the work of railway and road transport;

Fifth, implement strict and thorough thrift, which is an indispensable condition for implementing the policy of lowering prices and improving living standards.

Siroky said that we have stipulated that greatly increasing agricultural production and ensuring the maximum development of agricultural productivity are our most urgent and important tasks.

The following figures show the current state of agricultural production: Compared with the average index of the pre-war years 1934-1938, the yield of wheat per hectare increased by 18.7 percent; the yield of rye per hectare increased by 13.1 percent; the yield of barley per hectare increased by 17.1 percent; and the yield of oats per hectare increased by 3.7 percent. On the other hand, the yield per hectare of potatoes, sugar beets, flax, hops, and some other crops has not yet reached the pre-war level. The number of pigs has increased by 32.8 percent, the number of sheep has more than doubled, and the number of cattle (including cows) has decreased slightly. In addition to the above, the sown area of potato crops has decreased by more than 500,000 hectares compared with the pre-war level.

While emphasizing the need to greatly increase agricultural production, Siroky analyzed the basic reasons for not utilizing all the potential to develop agricultural production, especially the shortcomings of the Party's organs and land management organs in managing agriculture, and the fact that agricultural production was not fully mechanized. He pointed out the fact that farmers and members of unified agricultural cooperatives did not receive sufficient material encouragement to increase production.

Siroky said that, according to the draft instructions, by 1957, the unit area yield per hectare must be increased compared with 1953 as follows: wheat by an average of 12 percent, rye by 10 percent, potatoes by 15 percent, sugar beets by 18 percent, rapeseed by 50 percent, flax by 29 percent, and hops by 34 percent. Meat products will increase by 26 percent compared to 1953, pork and oils by 51 percent, and milk by 31 percent.

In order to supply the people with food, it is necessary to cultivate every hectare of land. The task is to increase the crop cultivation area by at least 200,000 hectares by 1957.

From 1954 to 1957, 320,000 people, especially young people, must be mobilized to engage in agricultural work.

Siroky continued, machine tractor stations play a decisive role in the development of agricultural production. The instructions require a substantial increase in tractors, doubling the number of tractors, including increasing crawler tractors by three and a half times, grain harvesters by more than six times, sugar beet harvesters by twenty times, and flax harvesters by six times. Not only should the degree of mechanization be greatly increased in grain production, but also in the cultivation of root crops, sugar beets, and potatoes, as well as in livestock production.

By 1955, 300 agronomists with higher education, 140 mechanical engineers, 3,100 agronomists with specialized education, and 650 engineering and technical personnel must be added to the machine tractor stations. In addition, by 1957, 27,000 staff members must be transferred from industry and other sectors of the national economy to work in machine tractor stations.

Siroky continued, efforts to increase agricultural production will expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and consolidate the political alliance between the working class and the working peasants. We are convinced that our efforts to greatly increase agricultural production will not only gain the full understanding of the members of the unified agricultural cooperatives, but also the understanding of the small and medium-sized individual farmers.

The Party and the government's concern for agricultural development further confirms the beneficial significance of the alliance between the working class and the small and medium-sized farmers. The staff of state-owned farms bears a great responsibility for ensuring the development of agricultural production. The instructions stipulate that a large amount of funds should be allocated for the construction of state-owned farms, to meet the needs of production and cultural life welfare, and to build housing. State-owned farms should be equipped with the most advanced machinery.

The reporter emphasized that the central issue of our policy in rural areas is to ensure the further development of unified agricultural cooperatives. The proportion of unified agricultural cooperatives in the total cultivated land area accounted for nearly 33 percent as of February 15, 1954. These unified agricultural cooperatives, together with state-owned farms and machine tractor stations, are an important foundation for building socialism in rural areas. The fact that unified agricultural cooperatives have greatly developed in recent years proves that the majority of small and medium-sized farmers have correctly understood that taking the road of socialist cooperative large-scale production is the only correct and beneficial road.

Siroky pointed out the shortcomings in establishing unified agricultural cooperatives, and then he said: The development of unified agricultural cooperatives fully proves the correctness of our agricultural policy and the correctness of fully supporting unified agricultural cooperatives. Unified agricultural cooperatives are the main way to ensure a substantial increase in agricultural production.

We believe that the achievements of our unified agricultural cooperatives will be a convincing evidence for small and medium-sized farmers who are still engaged in individual production, proving that joining the cooperatives is the right decision to improve their own welfare.

He put forward some specific tasks for the victorious development of the cooperative movement in the Czechoslovak Republic.

When Siroky spoke about the instructions on the 1955 National Economic Development Plan, he said: The backwardness of the main departments and the long-term disproportion caused by this backwardness are one of the central issues of the economic policy focused on by our Party. The instructions stipulate that coal mining should be increased by at least 5 percent in 1955, peat by 7 percent, and lignite by 21 percent. Special attention will be paid to the coal areas of Slovakia. The mining volume and electricity production should also be greatly increased. According to the draft plan for 1955, it is planned to increase electricity production by 11 percent, and the power generation capacity of power stations by 9 percent.

Siroky continued, according to the tasks we have put forward in building our economy, we must ensure the improvement of railway transport work.

Siroky said that after the currency reform, the supply of industrial products and food to the working people has improved, which undoubtedly proves the great achievements we have made in socialist production. After the abolition of the rationing system, socialist trade has generally expanded. The policy of improving the living standards of the working people requires the consistent implementation of a thrift system in production. This year, the cost of all industrial products should be reduced by 2.3 percent, and according to the instructions, it should be reduced by 3 percent by 1955.

Siroky also talked about the fact that the draft instructions on the short-term plan to greatly increase agricultural production in the recent two or three years and the draft instructions on the 1955 National Economic Development Plan have won unanimous support and enthusiastic support from all walks of life. He said: The Party and the government have put forward the following as our basic economic tasks for 1954 to 1955: developing agricultural production, ensuring the further development of raw materials, fuel and power bases, improving transportation, supplying the working people with sufficient high-quality goods, improving the methods of serving the people, and consistently practicing thrift. All the strength of our national economy should be concentrated to successfully carry out these basic tasks.

Siroky concluded by saying that we have achieved great historical achievements in socialist construction. These achievements have been achieved by our heroic working people, who, under the leadership of our Party, have ensured our country's unprecedented economic and cultural prosperity. Our people are facing a new and brilliant prospect of continuous progress, continuous improvement of material and cultural standards, and the increasing strength of our People's Democratic Republic.

Siroky shouted long live the heroic working people, long live the unbreakable alliance of the working class, peasants and working intellectuals, long live the Czechoslovak Communist Party, long live the eternal brotherly affection and friendship between the people of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会上
    西罗基作了关于经济计划的报告
    在捷克斯洛伐克共产党第十次代表大会十三日会议上，西罗基就第四项议程作了“关于一九五五年发展国民经济计划和最近两三年内大大提高农业生产的短期计划”的指示的报告。
    西罗基着重指出，上述指示草案的目的在于按照社会主义的基本经济法则提高人民生活水平。
    西罗基说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国已经效法苏联的榜样，走上了社会主义建设的道路。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民向苏联学到了国民经济的工作和计划的最先进和最进步的方式与方法。西罗基着重指出苏联供给的工业原料和粮食，以及造船、锅炉和复杂电气机械的订货对于捷克斯洛伐克的巨大意义。
    西罗基说，经济基础的发展以及劳动人民生活条件的大大改善巩固了我们的人民民主国家，巩固了我们的制度的政治基础——工人阶级与劳动农民的联盟。为共同建设社会主义，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民——工人、农民和知识分子已更紧密地、牢不可破地团结在共产党与民族阵线政府的周围。在完成五年计划的过程中，我们国家的经济力量已大大加强，它的国际威望也大大提高了。
    但是，我们工作中的缺点，特别是我们经济的基本部门中的落后现象，也就是农业生产的大大落后已经成了我们继续进展的严重障碍。西罗基指出，必须毫不迟延地完成下列基本任务以保证国民经济的平衡发展：一、由于要求日益增加，要在最近的将来大大提高农业产量，以便以足够数量的食品，特别是肉类供给人民，并以原料供给轻工业和食品工业。
    二、加速地、有效地扩大采煤、发电和采矿的设备，以保证工业和国民经济其他部门的发展，并改善对居民的供应；
    三、增加消费品的产量，改善消费品的质量；
    四、大大改进铁路和公路运输的工作；
    五、实行严格而彻底的节约，这是执行降低物价和提高生活水平政策的必不可少的条件。
    西罗基说，我们规定大大提高农业生产以及保证农业生产力的最大限度的发展作为我们最迫切和最重要的任务。
    下面的数字表明目前农业生产的状态：和战前一九三四—一九三八年那几年的平均指数比较，小麦每公顷的产量增加了百分之十八点七；裸麦每公顷产量增加了百分之十三点一；大麦每公顷产量增加了百分之十七点一；燕麦每公顷产量增加了百分之三点七。另一方面，马铃薯、甜菜、亚麻、蛇麻草以及一些其他作物每公顷的产量还没有达到战前的水平。猪的数目增加了百分之三十二点八，羊的数目增加了一倍以上，牛（包括母牛在内）的头数稍有减少。除了上面所说的情况以外，马铃薯作物的播种面积比战前水平减少了五十万公顷以上。
    西罗基在强调必须大大提高农业生产的时候，分析了没有利用一切潜力以发展农业生产的基本原因，尤其是党的机关和土地管理机关在管理农业方面的缺点，以及农业生产没有充分机械化。他指出了这样的事实：农民和统一农业合作社的社员们都没有得到足够的物质鼓励来增加生产。
    西罗基说，根据指示草案，到一九五七年，必须把每公顷的单位面积产量比一九五三年增加如下：小麦平均增加百分之十二，裸麦百分之十，马铃薯百分之十五，甜菜百分之十八，菜子百分之五十，亚麻百分之二十九，蛇麻草百分之三十四。肉类产品比一九五三年增加百分之二十六，猪肉和油脂百分之五十一，牛乳百分之三十一。
    为了供给人民食品就有必要耕种每一公顷的土地。任务就是：到一九五七年至少要增加二十万公顷的作物耕种面积。
    从一九五四年到一九五七年，必须动员三十二万人，首先是青年来从事农业工作。
    西罗基继续说，机器拖拉机站在发展农业生产方面起决定性的作用。指示要求大量增加拖拉机，即将拖拉机的数目增加到两倍，其中包括履带拖拉机增加到三倍半，谷物收割机六倍以上，甜菜采掘机二十倍，亚麻收割机六倍。不仅在谷物生产方面应该大大提高机械化的程度，而且在根类作物、甜菜和马铃薯的耕种方面以及畜牧生产方面也应该大大提高机械化的程度。
    到一九五五年时，必须给机器拖拉机站增添三百名受过高等教育的农艺师、一百四十名机械工程师、三千一百名受过专门教育的农艺师和六百五十名工程技术人员。除此之外，到一九五七年为止，必须还要使二万七千名工作人员自工业和国民经济其他部门转入机器拖拉机站工作。
    西罗基继续说，努力增加农业生产，将会扩大城乡物资交流，巩固工人阶级与劳动农民的政治联盟。我们确信，我们争取大大地提高农业生产的努力不仅会获得统一农业合作社社员们的完全了解，并且也会获得中小个体农民的了解。
    党和政府对农业发展的关心进一步证实了工人阶级和小农及中农联盟的有益的意义。国营农场的工作人员对保证农业生产的发展负有很大的责任。指示规定拨出大量资金用于建设国营农场、满足生产和文化生活福利的需要以及建筑住宅。国营农场应以最先进的机器装备起来。
    报告人强调指出，我们在农村的政策的中心问题是保证进一步发展统一农业合作社。统一农业合作社在耕地总面积中所占的比重截至一九五四年二月十五日已将近占百分之三十三。这些统一农业合作社和国营农场及机器拖拉机站一起，是在农村建设社会主义的重要基础。近几年来统一农业合作社大大地发展了，这一事实证明：大多数小农和中农已正确地了解到走社会主义合作化大生产的道路是唯一正确和有利的道路。
    西罗基指出了在建立统一农业合作社中的缺点，接着他说道：统一农业合作社的发展充分证明了我们农业政策的正确性，全面支持统一农业合作社的正确性。统一农业合作社是保证大力提高农业生产的主要途径。
    我们相信，我们的统一农业合作社获得的成绩，对于还在进行个体生产的小农和中农来说，将是一个令人信服的证据，证明要提高他们自己的福利，加入合作社是一个正确的决定。
    他提出了一些捷克斯洛伐克共和国胜利发展合作社运动的具体任务。
    西罗基讲到关于一九五五年发展国民经济计划的指示时说道：主要部门的落后和由于这种落后而产生的长时期的不成比例的现象，是为我们的党所集中注意的经济政策的中心问题之一。指示规定一九五五年煤的开采量至少增加百分之五，泥煤增加百分之七，褐煤增加百分之二十一。对斯洛伐克的煤区将予以特别注意。矿藏的开采量和电力生产量也要大大增加。根据一九五五年的计划草案，预定要增加电力产量百分之十一，电力站的发电能力增加百分之九。
    西罗基继续说，根据我们在建设我国经济方面所提出的任务，必须保证改善铁路运输工作。
    西罗基说，在实行币制改革之后，对劳动人民供应工业品和食品的情况改善了，这毫无疑义地证明了我们在社会主义生产方面所获得的巨大成就。在取消配给制之后，社会主义贸易已普遍地扩展起来。提高劳动人民生活水平的政策要求在生产中始终不渝地实行节约制度。在今年，全部工业产品的成本应当减低百分之二点三，而根据指示到一九五五年，就要减低百分之三。
    西罗基还谈到关于最近两三年内大大提高农业生产的短期计划的指示草案和关于一九五五年发展国民经济计划的指示草案获得各界人民一致拥护和热烈支持的情形。他说：党和政府提出下列几项作为我们一九五四年到一九五五年的基本经济任务：发展农业生产，保证进一步发展原料、燃料和电力基地，改进运输事业，供给劳动人民以足够的上等货品，改进为人民服务的方法和始终不渝地厉行节约。我国国民经济的全部力量都应集中来胜利执行这些基本任务。
    西罗基最后说，我们在社会主义建设事业中已取得了历史性的巨大成就。这种成就是我们英勇的劳动人民取得的，他们在我们党的领导下保证了我国取得空前的经济和文化的繁荣。我国人民正面临着不断进步、物质和文化水平不断提高、我国人民民主共和国的力量日益增长的新的光辉的远景。
    西罗基高呼英勇的劳动人民万岁，工人阶级、农民和劳动知识分子的牢不可破的联盟万岁，捷克斯洛伐克共产党万岁，捷克斯洛伐克和苏联两国人民之间的永恒的兄弟感情和友谊万岁。
