    Progress of the "August" Young Pioneers of Vietnam in the Past Year
    Huang Shi'ai, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Women's Union

    The Vietnamese "August" Young Pioneers, named after the great "August Revolution" of the Vietnamese people, is an advanced organization of Vietnamese children and a mainstay of the vigorously developing children's movement in Vietnam. If we ask any child, "Do you want to be a member of the 'August' Young Pioneers?" they will all answer, "Yes!" Becoming a member of the "August" Young Pioneers is the common aspiration of every Vietnamese child. They believe that members of the "August" Young Pioneers should be brave children, good children, and excellent students... Some have a deeper understanding: the "August" Young Pioneers are the most honorable. The members of the "August" Young Pioneers are now assistants to the Vietnam National Salvation Youth League, future members of the League, and successors to President Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary cause.
    In the past year, in order to be worthy of being members of the "August" Young Pioneers, each of them has followed President Ho Chi Minh's six teachings (namely, love the motherland, love compatriots, be diligent in labor, abide by discipline, pay attention to hygiene, study culture, know how to love and hate, and unite with children all over the world) to study, and therefore have made significant progress.
    The most fundamental progress is the strengthening of the love for the motherland and hatred for the enemy among the vast number of children. In the Jian'an, Haiyang, and Taiping provinces on the left bank of the Red River in North Vietnam alone, according to incomplete statistics, the number of children hailed as the bravest has now increased to forty-four. Many famous young guerrilla heroes have emerged throughout Vietnam. Such as Nguyen Hoi Nghi, a young guerrilla hero in the Viet Bac inter-zone; Huang You Shu, a young guerrilla hero in Bac Giang province, who was awarded the third-class military medal; Pham Van Hung, a young guerrilla hero in Jian'an province; Tran Quoc, a special-class young guerrilla hero in Quang Binh province; and many children who have played exemplary roles in the struggle. For example, fourteen-year-old Le Quang Yang, the child of a poor peasant, worked as a messenger in the enemy-occupied area. Once, when the enemy came to his village to "sweep," he cleverly led the cadres to hide in secret tunnels. As soon as he disguised the tunnel, the enemy chased after him and arrested him. The enemy used extremely barbaric methods to torture him severely, and when they got tired of beating him, they soaked him in a puddle. After he swallowed a bellyful of water, they dragged him up and stepped on his stomach. But this brave young man never revealed anything. As a result, the enemy had to release him, and he actively resumed his activities. Le Quang Yang not only showed heroism in battle, but also studied diligently and actively participated in labor and production to help the families of cadres and soldiers. He was therefore elected as a young guerrilla hero in Ha Nam province in the Third Inter-zone. Another example is fifteen-year-old Du Thi Min, the captain of a young guerrilla team in Jian'an province on the left bank of the Red River in North Vietnam. She was unfortunately arrested by the enemy during an operation. The extremely barbaric enemy killed her mother and threatened to beat her two younger brothers to death if she didn't confess. But she still didn't confess. The enemy, enraged, shot her in the chest, but she didn't die. Later, she finally found a way to escape the clutches of the enemy. Although her wounds have not yet healed, she resolutely requested the village guerrilla headquarters to assign her work immediately because of her bitter hatred for the enemy.
    A young man in the enemy-occupied area of ​​Xianlang County, Jian'an Province, wrote a letter to President Ho Chi Minh saying: "The enemy captured Sun Sun [Note] in the rice fields. They beat me with gun butts, punched me hard in the chest, and put a knife on my neck to threaten me. But Sun Sun resolutely didn't say a word. The enemy threatened, 'If you don't point out the tunnel, I'll kill you.' Then they fired a shot 'bang' next to my ear. Sun Sun thought of Uncle's teachings and followed the example of his comrades who had heroically sacrificed themselves. The enemy is just pretending. They couldn't scare me, so they enticed me, 'Then write me a few songs and I'll let you go back.' Sun Sun wrote them a few songs 'Welcome to surrender to the enemy.' They had tortured, threatened, and enticed me many times, but all failed, and finally they had to let Sun Sun go back."
    Chen Yu Duo of Xianlang County, Jian'an Province, is a model of the Vietnamese children's unyielding patriotic spirit. The enemy's methods against the children were brutal. They gouged open Chen Yu Duo's ankles and cut his knees with knives. But Chen Yu Duo still scolded those murderous robbers angrily, pointing to the enemy's ugly faces, despising them. Finally, the enemy even cut open his stomach. Chen Yu Duo would rather sacrifice heroically than confess, which made the despicable enemy feel extremely surprised.
    In many villages in the enemy-occupied areas, Vietnamese children also resisted the enemy's "sweeps" and defended their hometowns together with the people. In October 1953, when the enemy carried out large-scale "sweeps" on the left bank of the Red River, the children of Xianlang County, Jian'an Province, fought heroically together with the people to defend the revolutionary base areas. No matter how bad the situation was, the children always maintained contact with the team and helped the people evacuate. Therefore, the Xianlang County Young Pioneers were commended by the People's Government of the left bank of the Red River, and were selected as a model Young Pioneers team in Vietnam in 1953.
    The above are just a few typical examples. Generally speaking, all the children who were tortured by the enemy refused to confess in the same way. This fully shows the strong feelings of Vietnamese children for their country, their love for cadres, the People's Army, and the people, and their deep hatred for the imperialist aggressors. This is a major achievement of the "August" Young Pioneers in educating Vietnamese children.
    Because of their love for their motherland, Vietnamese children are working hard to study. They realize that if they study well, President Ho Chi Minh will be happy, and studying well is also contributing to the war of resistance. Many model students have emerged among them.
    Nong Wen Yi, a student of the fourth grade of a first-level school in Ben Heng Township, Cao Bang Province, wrote a letter to President Ho Chi Minh saying: "Because I remember Uncle's teachings and realize the benefits of studying, I study hard. I have helped the Tax Committee do calculations for six days, broadcast military victory news seven times, dug a covered toilet, eliminated 1,253 flies, and caught 22 rats. Based on the above achievements, especially academic performance, the students of the whole school elected me as the special model student of 1953."
    Due to their high love for the motherland, they actively participate in the "Tran Quoc Toan work" (Tran Quoc Toan was a young Vietnamese hero in the anti-aggression war in the 13th century. Tran Quoc Toan work refers to the fact that children must follow President Ho Chi Minh's six major teachings in their daily study and work) to help soldiers and martyrs' families. The children in the Fifth Inter-zone were awarded by the Central and Southern Resistance War Administrative Committee because they achieved many results in the "Tran Quoc Toan work." For example, the children in Quang Ngai Province helped military dependents and families of martyrs with weeding, fetching water, sweeping the floor, husking rice, holding babies, and taking care of cattle for two thousand three hundred and fifty-three workdays. People asked them, "Why are you doing this?" They replied, "This is to express our heartfelt gratitude to the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves to protect us and the soldiers who are fighting heroically to protect us."
    Children whose parents, brothers, and sisters have joined the People's Army, supported the front lines, or participated in other resistance war work, actively help with housework and participate in production work. They are also very active in the patriotic health movement.
    In order to protect the crops, they have organized many cattle-watching teams. Every day when grazing cattle, they pay attention not to let the cattle trample on the dikes, not to let the cattle eat the farmers' rice ears, feed the cattle well, and actively collect cow dung. They also wash the cattle clean in the evening. They have come up with many ways to protect the cattle from enemy bombing. The children of Nam Lien Township, Yi An Province, weave bamboo mats and tie tree leaves to camouflage the cattle, so that enemy planes can only see it as a grave. The children of Xin An Township, Quang Ngai Province, have an even more clever method. They train the cattle to avoid airplanes. When enemy planes come, as long as a "command" is issued, the cattle will automatically disperse and hide.
    In mobilizing the peasant masses and the land reform movement, the children also gave the peasants enthusiastic support. They hold babies, take care of the house, and graze cattle, so that peasants can have time to attend meetings and study. They have organized many propaganda teams to encourage peasants to attend meetings and write slogans. Some children have also helped the public security and guerrillas to uncover landlords who are hiding property and sabotaging the land reform.
    In general, the most significant progress of Vietnamese children in the past year is that they increasingly love their country. It is precisely because of their high love for their country that they also have a very high love for the leaders of the people of all countries, the people of all countries, and the children. Internationalism is being fostered in the hearts of Vietnamese children. Nguyen Hue, a young man from Nan Jin Township, Nan Zhi County, Nan Dinh Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Malenkov saying: "We thank you, Uncle, and promise to overcome all difficulties and never bow to the enemy."
    The Vietnamese Young Pioneers of Mao Lin Village, Dong Tuo Township, Xian Lang County, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong saying: "During the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, we miss you, and we will further strengthen the unity and friendship between Vietnamese and Chinese children, and closely unite with children all over the world."
    The progress of the members of the Vietnamese "August" Young Pioneers and all Vietnamese children in all aspects in the past year is the result of the education and care of children by the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese People's Government, and President Ho Chi Minh, and the result of the love of all the Vietnamese people for children. Despite the extremely difficult environment of the war of resistance, President Ho Chi Minh still cares about children's issues all the time. No matter how busy he is, he still writes letters to Vietnamese children every year on "June 1st" International Children's Day or Mid-Autumn Festival. The Vietnam National Salvation Youth League follows President Ho Chi Minh's instructions and always pays attention to educating children to become excellent children who study well, work well, are healthy, happy, united, and strive to compete. Schools and parents also pay attention to educating children to become new construction talents in the future—talents with strong will and physical strength to fight for the war of resistance and national construction and to defend world peace.
      〔Note〕In Vietnam, men, women, old and young, all intimately call
        President Ho Chi Minh as Uncle, and the children call themselves Sun Sun.

    越南“八月”少年先锋队队员一年来的进步
    越南妇女联合会副主席  黄氏爱
    以越南人民伟大的“八月革命”命名的越南“八月”少年先锋队，是越南少年儿童的先进组织，是越南全国现正有力地发展着的少年儿童运动的中坚。我们不论问任何一个少年儿童：“你们想做一个‘八月’少年先锋队的队员吗？”他们将一致回答说：“想！”能够成为“八月”少年先锋队的队员是每一个越南少年儿童的共同愿望。他们认为“八月”少年先锋队的队员都应该是勇敢的少年儿童，是好孩子，是优秀的学生……。有的还更深刻地了解：“八月”少年先锋队是最荣誉的。“八月”少年先锋队的队员现在是越南救国青年团的助手，是未来的团员，是胡志明主席革命事业的继承者。
    过去一年来，他们为了不愧为“八月”少年先锋队的队员，个个都遵循着胡志明主席的六大教导（即爱祖国、爱同胞、勤劳动、守纪律、讲卫生学文化、会爱会恨并和世界的少年儿童们团结一起）去学习，因此获得了显著的进步。
    最根本的进步是加强了广大的少年儿童对祖国的热爱和对敌人的憎恨。仅在北越红河左岸地区的建安、海阳、太平三省，据不完全的统计，被誉为最勇敢的少年儿童现已增加到四十四人。越南全国已涌现出许多著名的少年游击英雄。如越北联区的少年游击英雄阮会仪；北江省少年游击英雄黄有书，他曾荣膺三级军功章；建安省的少年游击英雄范文兴；广平省的特等少年游击英雄陈国，以及许多在斗争中曾发挥模范作用的少年儿童。如十四岁的黎光扬，他是一个贫农的孩子，在敌后地区做通讯员。有一次敌人到他村里来“扫荡”时，他曾机警地把干部带到秘密坑道里去躲避，刚把坑道伪装好，敌人就追上来把他抓了去。敌人以极其野蛮的手段严刑拷打他，打得厌烦了便把他浸在水坑里，等到他吞饱了一肚子水后又拖上来用脚在他的肚上踩。但这位英勇的少年却始终不泄露半点东西。结果敌人只好把他释放出来，他又积极进行活动了。黎光扬不仅在战斗中表现了英雄气概，而且还勤勉学习，积极参加劳动生产以帮助干部和军人的家属。他因而被选为第三联区河南省的少年游击英雄。又如十五岁的杜氏珉，她是北越红河左岸地区建安省一个少年游击队的队长，在活动中不幸被敌人逮捕了。野蛮透顶的敌人杀死了她的母亲，并威胁她要是不招供连她的两个弟弟也要被打死。但她依然不招供，敌人老羞成怒地在她的胸旁打了一枪，可是她还没死，后来她终于想办法逃脱了敌人的魔掌。虽然伤痕还没痊愈，然而由于对敌人的切齿痛恨，她坚决要求村游击队部立即给予分配工作。
    在建安省先浪县敌后区的一个少年写信告诉胡志明主席说：“敌人在稻田里把孙孙〔注〕捉了去。他们用枪托来拷打我，狠狠地捶我的胸膛，又把刀子架在我的脖子上恐吓我。但孙孙坚决一句话也不说。敌人又威胁说‘要是不指出坑道，老子就要你的命。’接着就在我的耳朵旁‘隆’的打了一枪。孙孙心里想着伯伯的教导，仿照着曾经英勇牺牲的战友们的榜样。敌人是会装腔作势的。他们恐吓不了我，就引诱说：‘那你给我写几首歌，就把你放回去’。孙孙就给他们写了几首‘欢迎降敌’的歌曲。他们曾经三番四次地拷打、恐吓和引诱，可是全都落空了，最后只好把孙孙放回来。”
    建安省先浪县的陈玉多，是越南少年儿童坚贞不屈的爱国精神的典范。敌人对少年儿童的手段惨绝人寰，他们剜开陈玉多的脚踝，用刀砍他的膝盖。但陈玉多还是怒声叱骂着那些嗜杀成性的强盗，指着敌人丑恶的面目，蔑视他们。最后敌人甚至剖开他的肚子。陈玉多这样宁愿英勇牺牲而决不招供，使得卑鄙的敌人也感到无比惊讶。
    在敌后区的许多乡村里，越南少年儿童们也和人民一起抵抗敌人的“扫荡”，保卫家乡。一九五三年十月间，敌人在红河左岸地区进行大规模“扫荡”时，建安省先浪县的少年儿童们曾和人民一道英勇战斗，保卫革命根据地。尽管情况如何恶劣，少年儿童们还是始终保持和队的联系，并协助人民疏散避难。因此先浪县的少年先锋队曾获得红河左岸区人民政府的嘉奖，并在一九五三年被选为越南全国的模范少年先锋队。
    上述仅是几个较为典型的事例，一般来说所有被敌人拷问的少年儿童，他们都一样地拒绝招供。这充分地说明了越南少年儿童爱国家、爱干部、爱人民军、爱人民的浓厚情感，和对帝国主义侵略者的深刻憎恨。这是“八月”少年先锋队对越南少年儿童们教育的重大成就。
    由于对自己祖国的热爱，越南少年儿童们正在努力学习。他们认识到要学习好，胡志明主席才会高兴，学习好，也就是对抗战出力。他们中间涌现出不少的模范学生。
    高平省本硬乡一级学校四年级的一位少数民族学生农文仪，他写信给胡志明主席说：“由于记住伯伯的教导，并认识到学习的好处，所以孙孙努力学习。孙孙已经帮助税务委员会做计算工作六天，广播军事胜利的消息七次，挖掘一个有面盖的厕所，扑灭苍蝇一千二百五十三只，捕鼠二十二只。根据上述的成绩，尤其是学习成绩，全校同学公选孙孙为一九五三年特等模范学生。”
    由于对祖国的高度热爱，他们积极参加“陈国钻工作”（陈国钻是在十三世纪前反侵略战争时的一位越南少年英雄。陈国钻工作系指少年儿童每天的学习和工作都必须遵照胡志明主席的六大教导）以帮助军人和烈士家属。第五联区的少年儿童们曾获得中南部抗战行政委员会的奖励，因为他们在“陈国钻工作”中获得了许多成绩。如广义省的少年儿童就曾帮助军属烈属耘草、吊水、扫地、砻米、抱娃娃、看牛二千三百五十三个工作日。人们问他们说：“你们为什么这样做？”他们就回答说：“这是为了表示对曾经为保卫我们而光荣牺牲的烈士们和正在为保卫我们而英勇战斗的战士们的衷心感谢。”
    家里有父母、哥哥和姊姊去参加人民军、支援前线或其他抗战工作的少年儿童，他们就积极帮助料理家务和参加生产工作。他们在爱国卫生运动中的表现也非常积极。
    为了保护庄稼，他们组织了许多看牛小组。每天放牛时他们都注意不让牛踏坏水堤，不让牛吃农民的稻穗，把牛喂得饱饱的，并且还积极捡牛粪，晚上回来又给牛洗刷得干干净净的。他们想了很多办法在敌机滥炸时保卫耕牛不受损害。义安省南联乡的少年儿童，织竹箔、扎树叶给牛伪装，敌机飞来时也只能看出像一个坟墓一样。广义省新安乡的少年儿童的办法更巧妙，他们训练耕牛，躲避飞机。敌机来时，只要一发出“号令”，牛就会自动分散隐蔽起来。
    在发动农民群众和土地改革运动中，少年儿童们也给予农民以热烈的支援。他们抱娃娃、看家、放牛，让农民能够有时间去开会和学习。他们组织了许多宣传队鼓动农民去开会和写标语。有些少年儿童还帮助公安和游击队破获地主分子隐藏财物，破坏土地改革的违法行为。
    总的来说，越南少年儿童在过去一年最显著的进步，就是日益热爱自己的祖国。也就是由于对自己祖国的高度热爱，所以他们对于世界各国人民的领袖，各国的人民和小朋友也非常的热爱，在越南少年儿童的心上孕育着国际主义的幼苗。南定省南直县南进乡的少年阮惠，他给马林科夫主席写信说：“我们感谢伯伯，并向伯伯保证克服一切艰难，决不向敌人低头。”
    先浪县东驼乡茂林村的越南少年先锋队写信给毛泽东主席说：“在越苏中友好月期间我们想念您，我们就更加强越南和中国少年儿童间的团结友谊，并紧密地和世界各国少年儿童团结一起。”
    越南“八月”少年先锋队队员和所有越南少年儿童，一年来在各方面的进步，是越南劳动党、越南人民政府和胡志明主席对少年儿童教育和关怀的结果，是越南全体人民对少年儿童的爱护的结果。尽管在极其艰苦的抗战环境中，胡志明主席还是时时刻刻关怀着少年儿童问题，工作不论怎样忙，每年逢到“六一”国际儿童节或中秋节时，他还是一样给越南少年儿童写信。越南救国青年团遵照胡志明主席的指示，时时注意教育少年儿童们成为学习好、工作好、身体好、愉快、团结、努力竞赛的优秀的少年儿童。学校和家长们也注意教育少年儿童们在将来成为新的建设人才——具有坚强的毅力和体力为抗战和国家建设以及保卫世界和平而斗争的人才。
      〔注〕在越南，无论男女老少，都亲密地称呼
        胡志明主席为伯伯，孩子们自称为孙孙。
