On the Significance of Archival Work and Existing Problems
Wu Baokang, Director of the Archives Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China

I.

Archives are all documents and materials (including photographs, films, and audio recordings, etc.) formed by various agencies, organizations, troops, enterprises, schools, and individuals in their entire work activities, and which have been processed and stored in archives (offices, repositories). The entire archives of an agency, organization, troop, enterprise, or school reflect all its work activities, and the national archives reflect the national work situation and the actual social life. Therefore, archives are a true historical record of all past work activities. Archives are one of the important assets of our Party and the state.

In order to manage archives well and make them effectively serve the country's socialist construction and historical research, a systematic archival work must be established. The basic contents of archival work include six parts: collection, arrangement, appraisal (research and determination of the preservation value of documents and materials, deciding on retention or destruction), storage, statistics, and utilization. These six parts are closely interdependent and inseparable. Any agency, organization, enterprise, troop, or school will generate documents in its work activities, and these documents should be scientifically organized and preserved for future use. This is not only because archival documents are indispensable for the daily work of agencies, organizations, enterprises, troops, and schools, but also because they can reserve document materials for the country, serve the country's various constructions and the development of historical science research, and at the same time prevent leakage of secrets. Therefore, archival work is one of the important parts of our Party and state's work, and is a work with political, historical, scientific, and practical significance.

Chairman Mao once said: "The basic task of the leading organs of the Communist Party lies mainly in knowing conditions and mastering policy, the former involving knowing the world and the latter involving changing the world." ("Reform Our Study") Archival documents and materials are precisely one of the bases on which our Party and state and every leader use to understand the situation, determine policies, and implement policies. Chairman Mao has taught us more than once about the importance of "detailed possession of materials" ("Reform Our Study"), and strengthening archival work is one of the ways to possess materials.

In political struggles, archival documents are often used. For example, the Soviet Union once used archival documents to publish a thirteen-volume collection entitled "International Relations in the Era of Imperialism," which revealed the imperialist nature, causes, and culprits of World War I. The Soviet Union's publications such as "Materials of the Trial in the Case of Former Japanese Army Servicemen Accused of Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons," "Exposing Falsifiers of History," and "Documents and Materials on the Eve of World War II" are examples of using archival documents and materials to conduct political struggle against the enemy.

Archival documents and archival work also play an important role in the study of revolutionary theory and historical science. Many of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism are based on a large number of archival documents and materials. Marx's "Capital," Lenin's immortal works "The Development of Capitalism in Russia" and "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," as well as "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," etc., were written using vast amounts of authentic historical document materials. Studying history and compiling history is impossible without archival documents as authentic historical materials.

In the period of planned economic construction, whether it is heavy industry, light industry, geological departments, water conservancy departments, or construction engineering departments, archival documents and materials can be used to serve the country's economic construction. In its economic construction, the Soviet Union often correctly formulated plans and accelerated the development of economic construction, reduced the country's economic expenditure, and avoided many wastes because it used archival documents and materials. Our country has now entered a period of planned economic construction, and scientific research work in various fields is more important than ever, which requires the use of a large number of archival documents and materials. Without archives, it is difficult to carry out scientific research work.

Doing a good job in archival work is also very important for agencies to prevent and overcome bureaucracy, improve work efficiency, and improve the work of agencies.

It can be seen that archival work is a very important work. Whether from the current or long-term interests of the Party and the state, doing a good job in archival work has far-reaching significance.

II.

The long-term war and the environment of white terror, the scattered and backward rural conditions, once made it impossible for us to build up the archival work of the revolutionary cause scientifically and completely; but even so, we still preserved many historical document materials of the Party and the state through heroic struggles in extremely difficult circumstances, and these materials have become invaluable treasures for us to study the historical development of our country's revolution.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, on April 21, 1951, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government convened the first National Secretaries-General Conference, which discussed and adopted the "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets" and "Provisional Measures for Handling Official Documents" and other proposals. The Government Administration Council promulgated these two documents on June 8 and September 29 of the same year, respectively. The "Provisional Regulations on Guarding State Secrets" stipulates that archives are one of the basic scopes of state secrets, and the "Provisional Measures for Handling Official Documents," in addition to stipulating the principles and methods for handling documents, also stipulates in its Chapter VII that each agency should set up an agency specifically for archives under the secretarial department, and central management should be the principle of archival work. This is a concrete manifestation of our Party and the state's emphasis on archival work and document processing work.

In just over four years, thanks to the attention of the Party and the state, my country's archival work has made certain progress and achievements. However, this work is not without problems. The original foundation of archival work is very weak, and the archival work of various agencies, organizations, enterprises, troops, and schools is not yet sound. Many archives before the revolution are still scattered in various agencies, various places, and even in the hands of individuals; the phenomenon of arbitrarily destroying archival documents still exists. Therefore, we must earnestly rectify and reform our country's archival work so that archival materials can be better utilized for national economic, cultural construction, and scientific services.

At present, the first thing to do in rectifying and reforming archival work is to establish a unified management system for archival work and improve the handling of documents in agencies; implement national supervision and planned centralization of historical archives. In order to realize the centralization of archival work, in order to overcome the chaotic phenomenon in the handling of documents and archival work in many agencies, before the establishment of a national archival work leading agency and the promulgation of unified archival management methods, the immediate task is to concentrate and protect all historical archives on the spot and improve the work of agency archives.

Second, actively study and publicize the Soviet Union's advanced and scientific archival theory in order to correctly organize archival documents and make full use of them to serve national construction and science. At present, the archival work of many agencies and organizations in our country still uses the decimal book classification method. This classification method comes from the United States and other capitalist countries. According to the Soviet Union's advanced archival principles, this decimal book classification method is not suitable for the classification of archival documents. Confusing library science with archival science will inevitably bring great harm to the correct organization of archival documents in the archives. We must learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in archival work, which is based on Marxist-Leninist theory and summarized from more than 30 years of practical work, to reform our archival work.

Third, we must train cadres and organize professional studies. At present, many archival work cadres and cadres who do other work in agencies do not have sufficient understanding of the important significance and role of archival work, and their professional knowledge is also insufficient. Some people think that: "Archives are a pile of old and waste paper, archival work is drilling into piles of old paper," "archival work is a boring, troublesome, affair, and trivial work," "archival work is a simple technical work," "doing a good or bad job in archival work has little to do with national construction and the interests of the people." These incorrect ideas are caused by their insufficient understanding of the significance of archival work or lack of professional knowledge. Archives are by no means a pile of waste paper, but an important asset of the country; archival work is by no means drilling into piles of waste paper, but preserving document materials for the country, conducting scientific organization with the Marxist-Leninist point of view and method, in order to serve national construction. The content of archival work is extremely rich, and to do a good job in archival work, one must have extensive scientific and historical knowledge in various aspects. Archival work is by no means a simple, boring, empty, troublesome work, but an important work with universality, political nature, scientific nature, and confidentiality. Archival work is one of the important parts of our Party and state's indispensable work, and it is closely related to the interests of the people. Failure to pay attention to archival work will inevitably bring great losses to the interests of the Party, the state, and the people. Regarding archival work merely as technical work is a reflection of bourgeois views in archival work. Only by overcoming the above-mentioned erroneous understanding can we lay an ideological foundation for rectifying and reforming archival work and create favorable conditions. At present, Renmin University of China has established an archival specialty course to systematically train archival work cadres, who will spread the Soviet Union's advanced experience and study together with archival workers across the country to reform our archival work.

In rectifying and reforming archival work, we must also pay attention to overcoming conservative and rash advance ideologies. The main manifestation of conservative ideology is sticking to conventions and unwillingness to reform. This ideology will make our archival workers stand still. Rash advance ideology is disregarding the actual situation and attempting to make things perfect all at once, and even having the idea of mechanically transporting the Soviet Union's advanced experience. It should be affirmed that the Soviet Union's experience is generally suitable for our country, but we must also consider the current actual situation and proceed step by step. The important task currently facing our archival workers is to raise archival work to the principle height of serving the country's socialist construction, regard archival construction as one of the basic construction works on the country's ideological front, strive to learn from the Soviet Union, vigorously publicize the superiority of the Soviet Union's advanced archival theory, follow the principle of combining Soviet experience with China's reality, actively rectify and reform our country's archival work, and strive to build socialism.

    论档案工作的意义及目前存在的问题
    中国人民大学档案教研室主任　吴宝康
    一
    档案是各个机关、团体、部队、企业、学校以及个人在其全部工作活动中所形成并已处理完毕保存在档案馆（室、库）中的一切文件材料（包括照片、影片和录音片等）。一个机关、团体、部队、企业、学校的全部档案，反映着这一单位的一切工作活动，全国的档案反映着全国的工作情况和实际的社会生活状况。因此，档案是过去一切工作活动的真实历史纪录。档案是我们党和国家的重要财富之
  一。
    为了管理好档案，使其有效地为国家社会主义建设和历史研究服务，必须建立系统的档案工作。档案工作的基本内容有搜集、整理、鉴定（研究和确定文件材料的保存价值决定存毁问题）、保管、统计和利用等六个部分。这六部分工作之间是互相有着密切的依存关系而不可分割的。任何机关、团体、企业、部队、学校在其工作活动中都会产生文件，这些文件就应该加以科学的整理和保管，以为日后利用。这不仅由于档案文件是机关、团体、企业、部队、学校的日常工作上不可缺少的，而且能为国家储备文件材料，为整个国家的各项建设以及开展历史科学的研究而服务，同时并能防止失密现象的发生。因此档案工作是我们党和国家工作中的重要部分之一，是一个具有政治、历史、科学以及实际意义的工作。
    毛主席曾说：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”
  （“改造我们的学习”）档案文件材料就正是我们党和国家以及每一个领导者用以了解情况，决定政策，执行政策的依据之一。毛主席曾经不止一次地教导我们关于“详细地占有材料”（“改造我们的学习”）的重要性，加强档案工作正是占有材料的办法之一。
    在政治斗争中，经常要利用档案文件。如苏联曾经利用档案文件，出版过一部十三册的文集，名为“帝国主义时代的国际关系”，它揭露了第一次世界大战的帝国主义的性质、起因及其祸首。苏联出版的“前日本陆军军人因准备和使用细菌武器被控案审判材料”、“揭破历史捏造者”、“第二次世界大战前夜的文件和材料”等书，就是利用档案文件材料来和敌人作政治斗争的例子。
    档案文件和档案工作在革命理论和历史科学的研究中也起着重要的作用。马克思列宁主义的经典著作很多都是以大量的档案文件材料为基础写成的。马克思所著作的“资本论”，列宁的不朽著作“俄国资本主义底发展”和“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”，以及“苏联共产党（布）历史简要读本”等书都是利用了庞大的真实历史文件材料写成的。研究历史，编纂历史，没有作为真实历史材料的档案文件是不可能的。
    在有计划经济建设时期，无论是重工业、轻工业、地质部门、水利部门以及建筑工程部门等，都可以利用档案文件材料，使它为国家的经济建设服务。苏联在经济建设中，常常因为利用了档案文件材料，得以正确地制定计划并加速经济建设的发展，减少国家的经济开支，避免许多浪费。我国现已进入有计划经济建设时期，各门科学研究工作比任何时候都更重要，这就更需要利用大量的档案文件材料。没有档案，要进行科学研究工作是困难的。
    做好档案工作对于机关防止和克服官僚主义，提高工作效率，健全机关工作，也是很重要的。
    由此可见，档案工作是一个十分重要的工作，无论从党和国家的目前利益与长远利益来说，把档案工作做好都是有着深远的意义的。
    二
    长期的战争和白色恐怖的环境，分散的落后的农村条件，曾使我们不能把革命事业的档案工作科学地完整地建设起来；但纵然如此，我们也仍在万分艰苦困难的环境下，经过英勇的搏斗，保存下许多党和国家的历史文件材料，这些材料已经成为我们研究我国革命历史发展的无价之宝了。
    中华人民共和国成立后，一九五一年四月二十一日，中央人民政府政务院召开了全国第一次秘书长会议，讨论通过了“保守国家机密暂行条例”和
  “公文处理暂行办法”等建议案。政务院并分别在同年六月八日和九月二十九日颁布了这两个文件。在“保守国家机密暂行条例”中规定了档案是国家机密的基本范围之一，在“公文处理暂行办法”中除规定了文书处理的原则和方法外，其第七章还规定各机关应于秘书部门之下设置专管档案的机构，并以集中管理为档案工作的原则。这正是我们党和国家重视档案工作和文书处理工作的具体表现。
    在短短四年多的时间中，由于党和国家的重视，我国的档案工作已经有了一定的发展和成绩。然而这一工作中并不是没有问题的。档案工作的原有基础非常薄弱，各机关、团体、企业、部队、学校的档案工作还不健全，革命前的许多档案仍分散在各机关各地方甚至各个人的手里；任意销毁档案文件的现象仍然存在。因此我们必须认真地对我国的档案工作进行整顿和改革，以便使档案材料更好地被利用为国家经济、文化建设与科学服务。
    目前整顿与改革档案工作中首先要做的，就是建立档案工作的统一管理制度，健全机关的文书处理工作；对于历史档案实行国家的监督和有计划的集中。为了实现档案工作的集中，为了克服许多机关中文书处理工作和档案工作中的混乱现象，在全国性的档案工作领导机构尚未建立、统一的档案管理办法尚未颁布以前，就地集中和保护所有历史档案和健全机关档案室的工作，就成为当前的迫切任务。
    第二，积极学习和宣传苏联先进的科学的档案学理论，以便正确地整理档案文件，并充分地利用它来为国家建设和科学服务。目前我国许多机关、团体的档案工作还采用着十进的图书分类法。这种分类法是从美国及其他资本主义国家传来的。根据苏联先进的档案学原则，这种十进图书分类法是不适合于档案文件分类的。将图书馆学与档案学相混淆，必然会给正确地在档案馆中整理档案文件带来极大的坏处。我们必须学习苏联建立在马克思列宁主义理论基础上的，从三十多年实际工作中总结出来的档案工作先进经验来改革我们的档案工作。
    第三，必须培养干部，组织业务学习。现在许多档案工作干部以及机关内做其他工作的干部，对档案工作的重要意义和作用还认识不足，业务知识也很不够。有的人认为：“档案是一堆古纸废纸，档案工作是钻古纸堆”，“档案工作是个枯燥、麻烦、事务、琐碎的工作”，“档案工作是一个简单的技术工作”，“档案工作做好做坏，与国家建设、人民利益没有多大关系”。这些不正确的思想是由于他们对档案工作的意义了解不够或缺乏业务知识而产生的。档案绝不是一堆废纸烂纸，而是国家的重要财富；档案工作也绝不是钻废纸堆，而是为国家保存文件材料，用马克思列宁主义的观点方法去进行科学整理，以服务于国家建设。档案工作的内容极其丰富，要做好档案工作必须具有广泛的各方面的科学知识和历史知识。档案工作也绝不是一个简单、枯燥、空洞、麻烦的工作，而是一个具有普遍性、政治性、科学性以及机要性的重要工作。档案工作是我们党和国家不可缺少的工作的重要部分之一，它密切地关联着人民利益，不重视档案工作必将给党和国家以及人民的利益带来莫大的损失。把档案工作仅仅看作是技术工作，是资产阶级观点在档案工作中的反映。只有克服上述错误认识，才能为整顿和改革档案工作打下思想基础，并创造有利条件。目前中国人民大学已设立了档案专修科，系统地培养着档案工作干部，他们将把苏联的先进经验传播开来，和全国的档案工作者一起学习，以改革我们的档案工作。
    在对档案工作进行整顿和改革中，还必须注意克服保守思想和冒进思想。保守思想的主要表现，是墨守成规，不愿改革。这种思想会使我们的档案工作者裹足不前。冒进思想，则是不顾实际情况，企图一下子搞得尽善尽美，甚至发生机械搬运苏联先进经验的想法。应该肯定：苏联经验一般都是适合我国的，但也必须考虑到目前的各种实际情况，一步一步地走。目前摆在我们档案工作者面前的重要任务，就是把档案工作提到为国家的社会主义建设服务的原则高度，把档案建设看作是国家思想战线上的基本建设工作之一，努力向苏联学习，大力宣传苏联的先进档案理论的优越性，遵循着苏联经验与中国实际相结合的方针，积极整顿和改革我国的档案工作，为建设社会主义而奋斗。
