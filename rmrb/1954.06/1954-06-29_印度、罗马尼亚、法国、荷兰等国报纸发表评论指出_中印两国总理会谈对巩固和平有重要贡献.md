Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 28th: "New Century" weekly published an editorial on its front page on the 27th, entitled "Welcome Zhou Enlai." The editorial said:

	"The Indian people warmly welcomed the birth of the People's Republic of China. Since then, our people's admiration for our great neighbor has increased day by day. The friendly ties between our two peoples have been strengthened. Our people hope that Zhou Enlai's visit will further greatly strengthen this friendship and goodwill."

	"Zhou Enlai's visit and his talks with our Prime Minister will have historic significance - not only for our two countries and the relations between our two peoples, but also for all of Asia and the world."

	"The New Delhi talks between India and China will powerfully illustrate that if the imperialists ignore Asia and the Asian people, they will only put themselves in danger."

	The editorial said that the new China stands as the vanguard of awakened Asia. The Indian people hope to get closer to our great neighbor. India and China together will lay a solid foundation for collective security among Asian countries. This will be the most serious blow to imperialism in Asia. The Asian people have foiled the imperialists' plot to wage war against the Asian people, which will be their greatest contribution to crushing the imperialists' conspiracy for world war, thereby greatly strengthening the cause of world peace.

	The editorial believes that "India and China, united in striving for the noble cause of freedom for the Asian people and defending peace in Asia and the world, will further consolidate the friendship between the peoples of our two ancient and great countries, which will guarantee peace in Asia and the world."
Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: According to a report by the Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, June 27th: "Free Romania" newspaper published a commentary on the meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru, saying that this meeting once again pointed out the special role that the People's Republic of China, as a great power, is playing today in resolving some issues that are very important for consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

	The commentary said that the participation of representatives of People's China in the Geneva Conference meant that the activities of the US ruling clique to isolate the People's Republic of China and obstruct it from obtaining its due position in international relations had been miserably defeated. During the Geneva Conference, the prestige of the People's Republic of China greatly increased throughout the world, especially in Asian countries. At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet delegation, carried out tireless and active activities to resolve the Korean and Indochina issues. In view of these facts, the meeting between Zhou Enlai and Nehru is a new affirmation of the efforts made by the People's Republic of China to maintain and consolidate peace in Asia and the world.

	The commentary said that people all over the world are paying extremely close attention to the results of the New Delhi talks. They believe that the understanding reached between the People's Republic of China and India on the resolution of some important issues related to Asia and the world will be an important contribution to maintaining and consolidating world peace.
Xinhua News Agency, June 28th: French and Dutch newspapers believe that the meeting between Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China and Prime Minister Nehru of India is of great significance.

	The French newspaper "Liberation" called the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru "historic talks" and believed that the friendly coexistence between China and India "greatly enhances the chances of peace."

	The Dutch newspaper "World Daily" of Rotterdam published an article on the 26th saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India "is a historic event, and its political significance cannot be overestimated."

    印度、罗马尼亚、法国、荷兰等国报纸发表评论指出
    中印两国总理会谈对巩固和平有重要贡献
    【新华社新德里二十八日电】“新世纪”周报二十七日在首页以“欢迎周恩来”为题发表社论，社论说：
    “印度人民曾热烈欢迎中华人民共和国的诞生。自此以后，我们的人民对于我们伟大邻邦的赞美一天比一天增加。我们两国人民之间的友好联系日益加强。我们的人民希望周恩来的访问能进一步大大加强这种友好和亲善联系。”
    “周恩来的访问以及他与我们的总理举行的会谈将有历史性的重要意义——不仅是对于我们两个国家以及我们两国人民之间的关系，而且对于全亚洲和全世界都有历史性的重要意义。”
    “印中两国的新德里会谈将强有力地说明：帝国主义者要是无视亚洲和亚洲人民的话，只会使自己遭到危险。”
    社论说，新中国作为觉醒了的亚洲的先锋屹立着。印度人民希望更加接近我们的伟大邻邦。印中两国一道将为亚洲各国之间的集体安全奠定巩固的基础。这将是使帝国主义在亚洲遭到的最严重打击。亚洲人民使帝国主义者对亚洲人民进行战争的阴谋遭到失败，这将是他们对粉碎帝国主义者的世界战争阴谋的最大贡献，从而他们将大大加强世界和平事业。
    社论认为，“印中两国联合起来致力于争取亚洲人民自由、保卫亚洲和世界和平的崇高事业，将进一步地巩固我们这两个历史悠久的伟大的国家人民之间的友谊，而这将保障亚洲和世界和平。”
    【新华社二十八日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十七日讯：“自由罗马尼亚报”就周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理会谈一事发表评论说，这次会见再一次指出了中华人民共和国作为一个大国，今天在解决一些对巩固亚洲和世界和平非常重要的问题方面所起的特殊作用。
    评论说，人民中国代表的参加日内瓦会议意味着美国统治集团想孤立中华人民共和国、并阻挠它在国际关系中取得应有的地位的活动遭到了惨败。在日内瓦会议过程中，中华人民共和国在全世界，特别是在亚洲国家中的威望大大提高了。在日内瓦会议上，中华人民共和国代表团和苏联代表团一道进行了不倦的、积极的活动，来解决朝鲜和印度支那问题。从这些事实来看，周恩来和尼赫鲁的会见是对于中华人民共和国为维护并巩固亚洲与世界和平所作的努力的新的肯定。
    评论说，全世界人民正极其注意地等待着新德里会谈的结果。他们相信，中华人民共和国和印度就一些有关亚洲和世界的重要问题的解决获得谅解，将是对维护并巩固世界和平的重要贡献。
    【新华社二十八日讯】法国和荷兰的报纸都认为中华人民共和国总理周恩来和印度总理尼赫鲁的会见意义重大。
    法国“解放报”把周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的会谈称为“历史性的会谈”，并认为中印两国友好相处“大大地增强了和平的机会”。
    荷兰鹿特丹的“世界日报”二十六日发表文章说，中华人民共和国总理周恩来访问印度“是一件历史性的事件，它的政治意义是怎样估计都不会过高的”。
