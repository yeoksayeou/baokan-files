    [Report from this newspaper] The Fourth Session of the Fourth Beijing People's Representative Conference closed on the 28th.

    On the 28th, the conference continued to discuss the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the issue of improving the quality of primary and secondary education. Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a concluding speech. He first pointed out that primary and secondary education had made great achievements in the past, but there were many serious shortcomings and problems. He said: The quality of education must be improved, and it is possible to improve it. First, there must be a unified and practical plan to gradually improve the quality of education, so that all parties can work together consistently. The current requirement for principals and teachers is only one: to run the school well, to teach students well, and to cultivate students who meet the requirements of "good health, good learning, and good work." Educational administrative departments and school leaders should pay special attention to improving the level of teachers and helping to solve the specific difficulties of teachers in schools. At present, it is necessary to solve the problem of compiling teaching guidelines and reference materials, summarize advanced teaching experience, and effectively promote it. It is also necessary to help schools solve the problem of a few bad teachers who hinder teaching work in a timely manner, but it is necessary to seriously and cautiously distinguish between them. Those who should be punished should be limited to criminals, because leniency towards them is cruelty to the next generation of the people. Bad students who seriously violate discipline or even violate laws and regulations should also be earnestly educated and dealt with appropriately. It is necessary to conscientiously correct the past chaotic phenomenon of excessive extracurricular burdens on principals and teachers. Relevant departments such as the government, trade unions, and women's federations should pay attention to appropriately solving the difficulties and welfare issues of teachers, especially the difficulties of female teachers with children. He emphasized that the key to improving the quality of education is for the educational administrative leadership to quickly and resolutely focus its main energy on teaching work and improve the level of teachers. This summer vacation should focus on solving the problem of compiling teaching guidelines and reference materials and the further training of some teachers with poor professional skills.
    The conference unanimously passed two resolutions on supporting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and on improving the quality of secondary and primary education in Beijing. In the "Resolution on Supporting the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," all representatives unanimously agreed that this draft constitution is one of the results of the great victories of the people's revolution and national construction achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. They expressed their warm support. All representatives decided to actively participate in and promote the study, discussion, and publicity of the draft constitution by people of all strata in the city after the meeting and to put forward opinions for the reference of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. They also guaranteed that all citizens would consciously abide by the constitution after its official promulgation and actively strive to complete the general task of the state's transition period and build a great socialist country.
    In the "Resolution on Improving the Quality of Secondary and Primary Education in Beijing," the conference unanimously agreed that the analysis of the situation of secondary and primary education in Beijing by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct, and the work tasks proposed by the Municipal Committee regarding the improvement of the quality of secondary and primary education are feasible. The conference agreed with the specific measures proposed in Director Weng Dujian's report and charged the Beijing Municipal People's Government with effectively leading the educational administrative departments to quickly and resolutely focus their main energy on teaching research and educational leadership, leading the principals, teachers, and students of various schools to effectively implement these specific measures. The resolution also pointed out that the issue of improving the quality of secondary and primary education is a major issue related to the more than 360,000 current students in the city, the more than 400,000 students after the summer vacation, and their parents, as well as all teachers and the people of the city, and the future construction of the entire country. The conference called on all secondary and primary education workers, parents of secondary and primary school students, and all students to actively work to achieve this task; people from all walks of life in the city should also work together to help various secondary and primary schools complete this task.

    北京市各界人民代表会议闭幕
    通过关于拥护宪法草案和提高中小学教育质量问题两项决议
    【本报讯】北京市第四届第四次各界人民代表会议在二十八日闭幕。
    二十八日，大会继续讨论了中华人民共和国宪法草案和关于提高中、小学教育质量的问题，最后并由彭真市长作了总结发言。他首先指出过去中、小学教育工作有很大成绩，但是缺点和问题很多很严重。他说：教育质量必须提高，也可能提高，首先要有一个统一的逐步提高教育质量的切实的计划，以便各方面共同一致地努力，当前对校长、教师们的要求只有一条，就是把学校办好，把学生教好，培养的学生要达到“身体好、学习好、工作好”的要求。对教育行政部门和学校的领导干部，要求特别注意提高教师水平，帮助解决学校教师中的具体困难，目前要解决编辑教学指导和参考材料问题，总结先进的教学经验，切实加以推广；还要帮助各学校及时解决阻碍教学工作的少数坏教员的问题，但必须严肃慎重地区别对待，要处罚的应限于违法犯罪分子，因为对他们的宽大，就是对人民后一代的残忍。对少数严重违反纪律甚至违法乱纪的坏学生也应认真教育，作恰当处理。要认真纠正过去校长、教师的课外活动负担过多的忙乱现象。政府、工会、妇联等有关部门要注意适当解决教师的困难和福利问题，特别是女教师带孩子的困难。他强调指出，提高教育质量的关键是教育行政领导部门把主要精力迅速地、坚决地放在教学工作上去，提高教师水平。今年暑期就应集中解决编写教学指导和参考材料的问题以及业务水平较差的部分教师的进修问题。
    会议一致通过了关于拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案和关于提高北京市中学和小学教育质量问题的两个决议。“关于拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案的决议”中，全体代表一致认为这个宪法草案是中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下取得的人民革命和国家建设伟大胜利的结果之一，表示热烈的拥护，全体代表决定在闭会后积极参加和推动全市各阶层人民对宪法草案的学习、讨论和宣传工作，并提出意见，以供中华人民共和国宪法起草委员会参考；并保证全体市民在宪法正式颁布后，自觉地遵守宪法，积极地为完成国家过渡时期总任务，为建设伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    在“关于提高北京市中学和小学教育质量问题的决议”中，大会一致认为：中国共产党北京市委员会对于北京市中学和小学教育状况的分析是完全正确的，市委所提出的关于提高中学和小学教育质量的工作任务是切实可行的。大会同意翁独健局长报告中所提出的各项具体措施，责成北京市人民政府切实领导教育行政部门迅速地坚决地把主要精力放到教学研究和教育领导上去，领导各学校校长、教师和学生，切实贯彻执行这些具体措施。决议并指出提高中学和小学教育质量的问题，是关系到全市现有三十六万多名、暑假后将关系到四十万多中小学学生和他们的家长，关系到全体教师和全市人民以及整个国家今后建设事业的重大问题。大会号召全市的中小学教育工作者、中小学学生家长和全体学生都要积极地为实现这个任务而努力；全市各界人民也都要为帮助各中小学校完成这个任务而共同努力。
