    中央司法部邀请文艺界人士举行座谈会
    研究运用文艺形式进行司法宣传的问题
    【新华社十八日讯】中央人民政府司法部在十八日下午邀请文艺界人士，座谈如何运用文艺形式来进行司法宣传的问题。会上，司法部向到会的文艺界人士介绍了目前我国的司法工作情况，并对文艺界今后配合司法宣传的问题提出一些要求和希望。参加座谈会的文艺界人士对这个座谈会表示非常欢迎，纷纷在会上发言。他们都表示愿意创作一些有关司法工作方面的文艺作品。
    会上，司法部副部长魏文伯对文艺界人士提出的问题作了说明和解答。他说：我们国家正处在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的时期；同时，我国已公布了第一个宪法草案。这个宪法草案将在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上通过后，作为中华人民共和国的根本大法。因此，加强人民的爱国守法教育，培养和提高人民的社会主义道德，用法律武器来保障国家经济建设的顺利进行，是我们国家当前一项重要的工作。他指示司法部今后要和文艺界代表经常取得联系，供给创作方面的必要材料，积极协助文艺界进行创作。
