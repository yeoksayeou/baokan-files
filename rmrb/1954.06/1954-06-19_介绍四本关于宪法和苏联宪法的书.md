    Bourgeois "scholars" have a chaotic understanding of the constitution. They explain the constitution's characteristics by referring to the origin of the word "constitution." They also make unscientific classifications of the forms of bourgeois constitutions based on superficial features. They believe that anything that uses one or more written documents to stipulate matters concerning the fundamental organization of the state is called a written constitution, and anything that expresses matters concerning the fundamental organization of the state through the state's ordinary laws and customs is called an unwritten constitution; they call constitutions that are not passed by so-called people's representative bodies but are granted by the monarch "imposed" constitutions, and constitutions that are passed by parliament or so-called national referendums are called "popular" constitutions; they also divide constitutions into so-called "rigid constitutions" and "flexible constitutions" based on the procedures for amending or supplementing the constitution.

    However, do modern bourgeois constitutional states truly have strict written and unwritten constitutions? The United States is a so-called written constitutional state, but we see that the Smith Act and the McCarran Act, implemented by the US ruling clique, which violate constitutional principles and are fascist in nature, are of more practical significance than its constitution. The so-called "imposed" or "popular" constitutions are also the same in essence. What they represent in bourgeois countries is not the will of the people, but only the will of the bourgeoisie. Finally, the so-called "rigidity" or "flexibility" of these constitutions does not depend on the forms adopted in the constitution itself, but on the political situation of the country and the changes in the class forces in the class struggle. Thus, it can be seen that the form of the bourgeois constitution obscures the essence of the constitution. Only Marxism-Leninism reveals the essence of the constitution: "What the constitution expresses is the concrete social relationship whose content is the will of the ruling class"; "The main mission of the constitution is to fix the social and state order that is favorable and pleasing to the ruling class."
  (From "The Concept and Essence of the Constitution," pages 9 and 11) The constitution is the superstructure of society, which arises from and is suitable for that foundation. Therefore, in different periods and countries, due to different political and economic conditions, there are also different bourgeois state and legal doctrines. Therefore, the constitution, as the fundamental law of the state, is a manifestation of the relationship of class forces in the class struggle. It is impossible to understand the essence of the constitution without this point.

    The first constitution of the modern bourgeoisie was the American Constitution, adopted in 1787, which arose as a result of the War of Independence. In Europe, written constitutions first appeared in France in 1791. Since the end of the 18th century, France has experienced many bourgeois revolutions, and has also replaced many constitutions accordingly.

    "The main foundation of the constitutions of the various bourgeois countries is the principle of capitalism, the basic cornerstone of capitalism: the private ownership of the means of production and the means of production; the system of man exploiting man and the existence of exploiters and the exploited; the poverty of the majority of workers and the luxurious extravagance of a small number of people who live in idleness without labor." (From "Constitution · Soviet Constitution," page 1) Therefore, no matter what form the constitution of a bourgeois country takes, in the past and now, it always reflects the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and reflects the fundamental law of the rule and exploitation of the majority of the exploited by the minority of the exploiters. Kotov's "The Concept and Essence of the Constitution" analyzes the essence and forms of constitutions of different types of countries, and criticizes the reactionary nature of bourgeois constitutional theory, explaining the concept and class essence of the constitution. In addition to classifying bourgeois constitutions into various categories from a formal point of view, bourgeois "scholars" have also created various idealist and metaphysical constitutional principles in an attempt to defend the consolidation of bourgeois rule. However, as "The Concept and Essence of the Constitution" points out, "The bourgeois constitution, like the entire capitalist system, is currently encountering a profound crisis." (Page 50) The signs of the constitutional crisis are that the bourgeois constitution is no longer the legal basis for the daily legislative activities of the legislative body, the reservations, restrictions, and constraints of bourgeois democracy are being applied on an increasingly large scale, and the policies of bourgeois states are becoming increasingly fascist. Emphasizing the crisis of modern bourgeois constitutions and the reasons for the crisis is one of the characteristics of this book. The original book is a record of the report by Soviet expert Comrade Kotov at the Renmin University of China, which is more suitable for Chinese readers. The "Constitution" article in "Constitution · Soviet Constitution" (originally two entries in the original book, now merged into one volume), translated from the "Soviet Encyclopedia," clarifies the meaning of "constitution" and the constitutions of various countries in principle, and focuses on summarizing the development of the constitution, from the American "Petition of Right" in 1628 to the new bourgeois constitutions implemented by various capitalist countries after World War II and the constitutions of people's democratic countries of the socialist type. The "Soviet Constitution" article explains the various aspects of the Soviet Constitution.

    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution led to the emergence of the Soviet socialist state, and with it, the first socialist constitution – the Soviet Russian Constitution. The first Soviet constitution was adopted on July 10, 1918, by the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets. This constitution, for the first time in human history, declared that the working people had seized power, and that the organizational form of the power was the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies. In 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was established. With the development of politics and economy and the changes in the class structure, the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets adopted the first Soviet Constitution on January 31, 1924.

    The socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production are the economic foundation of the Soviet Union. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist property in the means of production accounted for 98.7 percent of all means of production in the Soviet Union; the capitalist private ownership based on the exploitation of others' labor had been completely eliminated; the most difficult task of the socialist revolution had been solved – the collectivization of agriculture had been completed. The socialist production system occupied an absolute dominant position in the Soviet national economy. As the Soviet economy underwent socialist transformation, the class structure of Soviet society also changed accordingly. The working class became a completely new class; the peasants became completely new peasants; the Soviet intellectuals also changed, closely linked to the people and loyally serving the people; there were no longer any antagonistic classes in the Soviet Union, and Soviet socialist society was composed of two fraternal classes – workers and peasants. Due to the construction of Soviet socialist society, and the increasing strength and consolidation of the unity and friendship of the Soviet nationalities, the 1924 Constitution could no longer reflect these fundamental changes, and it was necessary to formulate a new constitution. Therefore, on December 5, 1936, the Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets adopted a new constitution reflecting the fact that the Soviet Union had built a socialist society.

    If the development of the Soviet Constitution is divided into two stages, the first stage includes the period from the October Revolution to the elimination of the exploiting classes, and the second stage is from the elimination of capitalist elements in urban and rural areas to the complete victory of the socialist system and the adoption of the new constitution. Denisov's "The Soviet Constitution and Its Historical Development" provides a more detailed discussion of the formulation and characteristics of the constitutions of these two stages, especially the discussion of the constitution in the first stage of the development of the Soviet state, which occupies about seven-tenths of the book. Before the first Soviet Constitution was formulated in July 1918, the Soviets had not had any constitution, but had passed many constitutional decrees. The author summarized them into four main categories: the first category was decrees related to breaking the old state apparatus and establishing new Soviet state organs, the second category was decrees related to destroying the old economic foundation and establishing the socialist economic foundation, the third category was decrees related to abolishing national oppression and realizing national equality, and the fourth category was decrees related to stipulating the basic rights and obligations of citizens. This book provides an analysis of these aspects, and the materials are detailed, with the nature of the Soviet constitutional history. However, some arguments have become outdated since the original book was published earlier (1948). For example, on page 21 of the book, Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-constitution of 1947 is broadly listed among the constitutions of bourgeois republics, and the Chinese translation (published in November 1953) does not add any annotations, which is a major oversight. As mentioned earlier, bourgeois states are further becoming fascist, and the book does not analyze these new developments.

    The new 1936 Constitution of the second stage is the fundamental law of the entire life, work, and struggle of the Soviet people, and the banner of the Soviet people's struggle against fascism during the Patriotic War. Karpinsky's "General Theory of the Soviet Constitution" is an excellent work explaining this constitution. The author first uses "Our Great Motherland" as an introduction, arguing that the Soviet Union is the most powerful country in the world, based on the Soviet territory, resources, socialist industry, agriculture, and the victory of the Great Patriotic War. In addition to the introduction, it is divided into fourteen chapters, which vividly and detailedly explain the two forms of socialist ownership fixed by legal procedures and their significance, the organizational forms and organizational principles of the Soviet state organs, and the basic rights and obligations of Soviet citizens. What are the characteristics and advantages of socialist state power organs and state management organs over capitalist countries? How does it differ from the so-called congresses of capitalist countries? The answers to all these questions can be found in this book. As a Soviet citizen, the Soviet Constitution grants him the rights and freedoms that are not available and impossible in capitalist countries. The hypocritical democracy of the bourgeoisie is usually limited to stipulating the formal rights of citizens, without paying attention to the conditions, possibilities, and material basis for realizing these rights; the Soviet Constitution does not have any preconditions and restrictions on all the rights and freedoms of citizens, and specifically guarantees the realization of these rights and freedoms of citizens by legislative procedures and material conditions. "General Theory of the Soviet Constitution" uses the method of comparing with the bourgeois constitution everywhere to explain the preciousness of the Soviet Constitution. This book is valuable for our discussion of our draft constitution.

    介绍四本关于宪法和苏联宪法的书

    “苏联宪法通论”苏联卡尔宾斯基著　沈颖　等译

    资产阶级“学者”们对于宪法的认识是混乱不堪的。他们从宪法一词的来源来解释宪法，说明宪法的特性。他们又根据外表上的特征，对资产阶级宪法的形式作不科学的分类。他们认为凡是以一个或数个书面文件来规定关于国家根本组织的事项，就叫做成文宪法，凡是以国家的普通法律和惯例来表现国家根本组织事项的，就叫做不成文宪法；他们把不是由所谓人民代表机关通过的，而是由君主所赐予的宪法叫做“钦定”宪法，把由国会通过或者所谓按全民投票方式通过的宪法叫做“民定”宪法；他们又根据宪法修改或补充的程序，把宪法分为所谓“刚性宪法”和“柔性宪法”。
    但是，现代的资产阶级立宪国家，是不是真正有严格的成文宪法和不成文宪法呢？美国是所谓成文宪法的立宪国家，但是，我们看到，美国统治集团所执行的破坏宪法原则的法西斯化的史密斯法，麦卡伦法，比它的宪法是具有更实际的意义的。所谓“钦定”或“民定”宪法，在本质上也都一样。它们在资产阶级国家里所表现的，都不是人民的意志，而只是资产阶级的意志。最后，这些宪法的所谓“刚性”或“柔性”，决不是取决于记载在宪法本身中的所已采取的形式，而是取决于它这个国家的政治局势，取决于阶级斗争中阶级力量的变化。由此可见，资产阶级宪法的形式，掩盖了宪法的本质。只有马克思列宁主义才道出了宪法的实质：“宪法所表现的就是以统治阶级的意志为内容的具体社会关系”；“宪法的主要使命在于固定有利于和惬意于统治阶级的社会秩序和国家秩序”。
  （“宪法的概念与本质”，第九、第十一页）宪法是社会的上层建筑，它是从那个社会产生并适合于那个基础的。因此，在不同的时期和国家中，由于不同的政治和经济的条件，也就有不同的资产阶级国家和法权的学说。因此，作为国家根本法的宪法是阶级斗争中阶级力量对比关系的表现。如果脱离这一点，就不可能了解宪法的实质。
    现代资产阶级的第一个宪法，是一七八七年通过的美国宪法，它是由于独立革命战争的结果而产生的。在欧洲，成文宪法在一七九一年首先出现于法国。从十八世纪末开始，法国曾经历多次的资产阶级革命，同时也相应地更换了许多宪法。
    “构成各资产阶级国家宪法主要基础的是资本主义的原则，资本主义的基本柱石：生产工具与生产资料的私有制；人剥削人的制度和剥削者与被剥削者的存在；劳动者大多数人的贫困和不事劳动而生活富足的少数人的奢侈挥霍。”（“宪法·苏联宪法”第一页）所以无论资产阶级国家的宪法是以何种形式出现，过去和现在总归是反映资产阶级专政的，反映少数剥削者对多数被剥削者的统治和剥削的根本大法。科托夫的“宪法的概念与本质”一书，对于不同类型国家的宪法的本质及其形式作了分析，并批判了资产阶级宪法理论的反动性，说明了宪法的概念与宪法的阶级本质。资产阶级“学者”们除从形式上来把资产阶级宪法分为哪种哪类外，并创造了各种唯心论的、形而上学的宪法原理，来企图为巩固资产阶级的统治而辩护。但是，正如“宪法的概念与本质”一书所指出的，“资产阶级宪法也如同整个资本主义体系一样，现时正遭遇着深刻的危机。”（第五十页）宪法危机的标志在于资产阶级宪法已不再是立法机关日常立法活动的法律根据，资产阶级民主主义的保留条件以及限制和拘束都被越来越大规模地加以运用，资产阶级国家的政策变得越来越法西斯化。着重地指出现代资产阶级宪法的危机和危机产生的原因，是这本书的特点之一。原书是苏联专家科托夫同志在中国人民大学的报告记录，比较适宜于我国读者阅读。译自“苏联大百科全书”的“宪法·苏联宪法”一书（在原书中是两个条目，现在合并为一册）中的“宪法”一条，对“宪法”的涵义和各国的宪法作了原则上的阐明，并着重地概述了宪法的发展，从一六二八年美国的“权利请愿书”起说到第二次世界大战后各资本主义国家所实行的新的资产阶级宪法以及社会主义类型的人民民主国家的宪法。“苏联宪法”一条则说明了苏联宪法的各个方面。
    十月社会主义革命的胜利，出现了苏维埃社会主义国家，并随着出现了第一部社会主义宪法——苏俄宪法。第一个苏维埃宪法，是在一九一八年七月十日由第五次全俄苏维埃代表大会通过的，这个宪法在人类历史上第一次宣告了劳动人民掌握了政权，政权的组织形式是工兵农代表苏维埃。一九二二年，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟（苏联）成立了。随着政治经济的发展和阶级对比的变化，一九二四年一月三十一日第二次全苏联苏维埃代表大会通过了第一个苏联宪法。
    社会主义经济制度和生产资料社会主义所有制，是苏联的经济基础。到第二个五年计划结束时，生产资料方面的社会主义财产，已占苏联全部生产资料的百分之九十八点七；以剥削他人劳动为基础的资本主义私有制，已经完全消灭；社会主义革命的最困难的任务已经解决——农业集体化事业完成了。社会主义生产体系在苏联国民经济中占了绝对的统治地位。由于苏联经济实行了社会主义改造，苏维埃社会的阶级结构也与此相应地有了变化，工人阶级变成了完全新的阶级；农民变成了完全新的农民；苏联的知识分子也有了变化，他们是和人民密切联系着，并忠诚地服务于人民；苏联再也没有对抗的阶级，苏联的社会主义社会是由两个互相友爱的阶级——工人和农民所组成。由于苏联社会主义社会的建成，以及苏维埃各民族的团结与友谊已日益增强和巩固，一九二四年的宪法已不能反映这些根本变化，有必要制定新的宪法。于是，一九三六年十二月五日第八次全苏联苏维埃代表大会通过了反映苏联已经建成社会主义社会事实的新的宪法。
    如果把苏维埃宪法的发展分为两个阶段，那就是第一阶段包括从十月革命起到消灭剥削阶级的这一段时间，第二阶段是从消灭城乡资本主义分子起到社会主义体系完全胜利和通过新宪法为止。杰尼索夫的“苏维埃宪法及其发展史”对于这两个阶段宪法的制定和特点，都作了比较详细的论述，特别是对苏维埃国家发展第一阶段中的宪法的论述占据了全书篇幅十分之七左右。在一九一八年七月第一个苏维埃宪法制定以前，苏维埃虽没有过任何宪法，但是曾通过多次宪法性的法令，作者把它归纳为四个主要种类，第一类为有关打碎旧的国家机器和建立新的苏维埃国家机关的法令，第二类为有关摧毁旧经济基础和建立社会主义经济基础的法令，第三类为有关取消民族压迫实现民族平等的法令，第四类是有关规定公民基本权利和义务的法令。这本书对这方面都有分析，而且材料翔实，具有苏联制宪史的性质。但是，由于原著出版得较早（一九四八年），有些论点已经过时。例如，该书第二十一页把一九四七年蒋介石的伪宪法笼统地列于资产阶级共和国宪法之中，而中译本（出版于一九五三年十一月）对此未加注释，是一个重大的疏忽。如前所说，资产阶级国家正在进一步法西斯化，而对于这些新的发展，本书也未及加以剖析。
    第二阶段的一九三六年新宪法，是苏维埃人民整个生活、工作和斗争的根本法，是苏维埃人民在卫国战争期间反抗法西斯斗争的旗帜。卡尔宾斯基的“苏联宪法通论”一书是阐述这个宪法的一本优良著作。作者首先以“我们伟大的祖国”作为引言，从苏联领土、富源、社会主义的工业、农业、伟大卫国战争的胜利来论证苏联是世界上最强大的国家。引言以外，共分十四章，生动地、详细地说明了用法律手续固定下来的社会主义所有制的两种形式和它的意义，苏联国家机构的组织形式和组织原理，苏维埃公民的基本权利和义务等。社会主义国家权力机关和国家管理机关对资本主义国家有哪些特点和优越性？它与资本主义国家的所谓国会有什么不同？对于所有这些问题，都可以在这本书中得到解答。作为一个苏维埃公民，苏联宪法赋予了他那种在资本主义国家里所没有的也不可能有的权利和自由。资产阶级的虚伪民主通常是以规定公民的形式权利为限，而不注意于实现这些权利的条件、可能和物质基础；苏联宪法对于公民的一切权利和自由，没有任何附带条件和限制，并特别地按立法手续用物质条件保证公民的这些权利和自由之实现。“苏联宪法通论”一书处处用与资产阶级宪法对比的方式来说明苏联宪法的可贵。对于我们讨论我国宪法草案，这本书是有参考价值的。
