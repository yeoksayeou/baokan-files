    PingShun County Constructs a Large Reservoir
    The state has helped the people of ChengGuan District, PingShun County, Shanxi Province, to build a large reservoir. This reservoir can hold 171,000 dan of water and has silt removal and water filtration equipment. The reservoir can supply people with drinking and domestic water all year round. In the past, it was very difficult for the people of ChengGuan District, PingShun County, located in the Taihang Mountains, to obtain drinking and domestic water. No springs could be found within a radius of 160 li. Whenever there was a water shortage in the spring and winter, people had to cross mountains and ridges to carry water from Shixia Gou, which was 20 li away. It was difficult to buy a dan of water even for several thousand yuan. In order to save water, people often did not bathe for years or wash clothes for months, which affected their health. At the same time, the time spent carrying water affected production. In order to solve the problem of drinking and domestic water for the people of PingShun ChengGuan, the Water Conservancy Bureau of Shanxi Provincial People's Government conducted a detailed survey in the local area last year. After trying to drill for spring water under the rocks and drilling deep wells without success, the state invested more than 300 million yuan in November last year to start building the reservoir. In mid-May of this year, the large reservoir named "People's Pool" was completed. (Xinhua News Agency)

    平顺县修建一座大型蓄水池
    国家帮助山西省平顺县城关区人民建成一座大型蓄水池，这个蓄水池可容水十七万一千担，并有澄泥、滤水设备。蓄水池可以常年供应人民饮水和用水。座落在太行山中的平顺县城关区人民，过去吃水用水，非常困难。方圆一百六十里内寻不到泉水，每当春、冬缺水时，人们为了吃一担水，就要翻山越岭到二十里开外的石匣沟去担水。一担水数千元都不易买到。人们为了节约用水，甚至常年不洗澡、终月不洗衣，影响到卫生健康，同时因为担水误工多影响生产。为了解决平顺城关人民饮水、用水问题，去年山西省人民政府水利局曾在当地做了详细的勘查，经过试凿石下泉水和凿锥深井未得到成效后，去年十一月即由国家投资三亿多元，开始修建蓄水池。今年五月中旬，建成了这座命名为
  “人民池”的大型蓄水池。　（新华社）
