　　New Three-Tube Radios Now Available

　　The first batch of inexpensive and high-quality AC three-tube regenerative radios produced by the state-owned Shanghai People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory has recently become available.

　　This newly produced three-tube radio has a trapezoidal shape, is small and elegant, and comes in four attractive and harmonious colors: coffee, cream, crimson, and blue-gray. The knobs on the radio are made of colored translucent plastic. The factory's technicians conducted test listening sessions in the suburbs and downtown areas of Shanghai, and the results were excellent. When listening to broadcasts from the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station, only a two-meter-long trailing wire was needed to hear the sound clearly and loudly without any noise. With a good outdoor antenna, it is also possible to receive broadcasts from strong power stations in other cities. This radio is very energy-efficient, using only the equivalent of twenty light bulbs. Each unit is priced at 630,000 yuan. Since its launch, the three-tube radio has been welcomed by the general public, with one unit in Shenyang purchasing 200 units at once.

　　Successful Trial Production of High-Top Linen Canvas Boots

　　The Dalian Rubber Factory has successfully trial-produced high-top linen canvas boots and has now signed a production and sales contract with the China Department Store Lüda Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station for official production.

　　In the past, the Lüda area has always experienced a shortage of high-top boots due to insufficient rubber for manufacturing them. After research, Zhang Qichao and Yue Yongqing, commodity researchers at the Lüda Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station, believed that water-resistant linen canvas could replace rubber for the boot uppers. This would allow for mass production of high-top boots to meet the needs of the people. This suggestion was welcomed by the leaders and workers of the Dalian Rubber Factory. After three trial productions, the factory workers overcame technical and operational difficulties and finally succeeded.

　　The quality of the trial-produced high-top linen canvas boots is the same as that of boots made entirely of rubber, and the price is lower. According to preliminary estimates, each pair can be sold for approximately 40,000 yuan less. Using linen canvas for the uppers saves rubber materials that, based on the wholesale station's annual intake of high-top boots, could be used to make more than 37,000 pairs of "Hercules" brand shoes.

　　Increasingly Beautiful and Novel Printed Fabrics

　　In the sample room of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, beautiful and novel patterns are designed every day. Among the many designers, there is a young designer named Wu Zhiyin, who joined the workforce last summer after graduating from the Central Academy of Fine Arts. While still studying, she collected many patterns from the Forbidden City and folk paper-cuts. Over the past year, she has repeatedly studied these classical and folk arts, and more than twenty patterns she designed have already been printed on fabric.

　　In mid-April, designers from the sample room, together with representatives from the China Cotton Yarn Fabric Company Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station and other units, took various colored fabrics and more than 600 samples to rural areas to hold printed fabric exhibitions and solicit farmers' opinions in order to design more new patterns based on the preferences of the vast number of farmers.

　　Now, while people are still buying beautiful summer printed fabrics, batches of new winter dark-colored fabric patterns have already been sent to printing and dyeing factories. This winter, people will be able to buy "Snowflake Serge" with its simple elegance, "Butterfly Lovers" with its beautiful colors, and various other patterned fabrics.

　　"Ukrainian" Style Projectors

　　Our country's first state-owned factory for manufacturing movie projectors, the State-owned Nanjing Film Machinery Factory, has produced more than 1,000 projectors since its establishment more than two years ago, supplying the needs of various parts of the country. This year, the factory will manufacture a large number of "Ukrainian" style projectors to equip more film projection teams across the country. The "Ukrainian" style projector is a lightweight, new type of projector that is better suited to the open spaces and large audiences required for outdoor screenings. The film machinery factory has already produced fifty "Ukrainian" style projectors.

　　Beautiful Enamelware

　　Zhu Zhaozhi, a technician at the Jilin Enamel Factory, and the workers successfully trial-produced a bleached creamy-yellow enamel. Using this enamel can produce creamy-yellow enamelware that has more beautiful colors, better gloss, finer porcelain, and lower costs than enamelware made with antimony-platinum enamel.

　　In the past, our country used antimony-platinum enamel to manufacture various enamelware products and could not produce bleached creamy-yellow enamel. Last year, Zhu Zhaozhi visited Shanghai and learned that countries such as Czechoslovakia had a bleached creamy-yellow enamel that could be used to enamel various beautiful creamy-yellow products without adding any pigment. After returning to the factory, Zhu Zhaozhi began to trial-produce this enamel. The work did not go smoothly, and he failed seven times in a row. The bleached creamy-yellow enamel was supposed to be very fresh, but the enamel he made was dark and muddy. However, Zhu Zhaozhi did not lose heart and continued to experiment, often consulting with veteran workers. After more than a year of hard work, he finally succeeded in trial-producing bleached creamy-yellow enamel.

　　Successful Manufacturing of Calcium Gluconate Using Fermentation Method

　　The Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry has successfully researched the manufacturing of calcium gluconate using the fermentation method.

　　Calcium gluconate is a widely used calcium-based pharmaceutical agent in medicine. It can be taken by people suffering from chronic diseases caused by calcium deficiency, and it is especially needed by pregnant women, lactating women, and young children.

　　Calcium gluconate is also the main raw material for manufacturing the special drug for schistosomiasis, sodium stibogluconate. In addition, calcium gluconate has recently been used in veterinary medicine to treat milk fever in dairy cows. Therefore, the annual demand for calcium gluconate is very large.

　　In the past, although some pharmaceutical factories in our country used the electrolytic method to manufacture calcium gluconate, the electrolytic method had low efficiency and high production costs, making it unsuitable for mass production. Therefore, most of the supply still relied on imports from abroad.

　　Since signing a contract with the State-owned Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory in April 1953 to manufacture calcium gluconate using the fermentation method, the Shanghai Industrial Experiment Institute of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Light Industry has successfully manufactured it through the continuous efforts of the researchers in the institute's fermentation group. Using the fermentation method to manufacture calcium gluconate not only results in excellent quality and lower costs, but also increases production by more than double compared to the electrolytic method, making it suitable for mass production.

　　The institute has now submitted all of its research results to the State-owned Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory. It is expected that mass production will begin in the second half of the year to meet the needs of the people nationwide.

　　Mass Production of Mosquito Repellent Oil with Eight-Hour Effectiveness

　　The State-owned Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully trial-produced mosquito repellent oil and has begun mass production. Recently, more than 200,000 bottles have been shipped to various locations.

　　The mosquito repellent oil successfully trial-produced by the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory has a strong insect-repelling effect. Applying the mosquito repellent oil to the body once can prevent bites from any insects for eight hours. This oil can prevent bites from more types of insects than the mosquito repellent oil made in the United States in the past, and it lasts more than twice as long, while the price is one-third cheaper. This mosquito repellent oil has a slight fragrance, does not irritate the skin when applied, and does not stain clothing. Many units in various places have already placed orders with the Nanjing Pharmaceutical Factory, with the Northeast Forest Industry Bureau ordering 200,000 bottles. To meet the needs of various units, the factory's employees are actively improving their operating techniques to increase production.

　　Colored Fabrics Produced in Yunnan

　　Yunnan Province has built a new bleaching and dyeing factory, and the people of the province can now buy various colored fabrics produced in the province.

　　Since liberation, Yunnan Province's textile industry has developed to a certain extent. In particular, after the expansion of the Yunnan Textile Factory's fabric mill last year, the output of fabrics has increased by about tenfold. However, there was a complete lack of modern bleaching and dyeing industry to match this. As a result, various colored fabrics such as the crimson fabric most loved by young women in rural areas, the gray fabric worn by government officials, and the An'an blue fabric and black fabric worn by the elderly and middle-aged people still had to be transferred from other provinces.

　　The newly built Yunnan Bleaching and Dyeing Factory not only has equipment for bleaching and dyeing general low-grade colored fabrics, but also has singeing machines, mercerizing machines, naphthol machines (An'an blue machines), and fabric finishing equipment such as stretching machines and fabric folding machines for bleaching and dyeing high-grade colored fabrics. The same gray cloth, after singeing, mercerizing, and other processes, followed by dyeing, not only has a good color and luster, but is also more durable.

　　Shenyang Woolen Mill to Increase Production of Serge and Yarn

　　The Shenyang Woolen Mill will repair a 3,200-square-meter sawtooth-shaped combing workshop this year, and construction has already begun. A complete set of combing machines will be installed in this workshop. At the same time, complex raising machines, raising preparation machines, shearing machines, breaking twister machines, steaming and drying machines, and other equipment will also be installed in the existing workshops. By 1955, the factory's output of serge and yarn will be greatly increased. If calculated based on eight hours of production per day, the extra serge produced annually can be used to make 41,600 sets of serge uniforms; the extra yarn produced can enable 159,400 people to each wear a set of woolen sweaters and trousers. After the factory's expansion is completed, it can also produce raising velvet, which it could not produce in the past.

    供应人民更多样的生活用品
    新出产的三灯收音机开始供应
    国营上海人民广播器材厂最近生产的第一批价廉物美的交流三灯再生式收音机已开始供应。
    这种新出产的三灯收音机，外壳为方梯形，小巧大方，漆色分咖啡、奶油、紫红、蓝灰四种，美观调和。收音机上之旋钮为塑胶制彩色半透明体。这批收音机曾经该厂技术人员在上海市近郊和市中心进行试听，效果良好，在收听上海市人民广播电台的广播时，只需用二公尺左右的拖线即可听到，声音宏亮清晰，没有杂音。在有良好的户外天线情况下，并可收听到外埠强力电力的播音。这种收音机很省电，只等于二十支电灯泡的用电量。每架的售价是六十三万元。三灯机上市后，受到广大人民的欢迎，沈阳某单位一次就买去二百架。
    亚麻帆布高腰水靴试制成功
    大连橡胶工厂试制亚麻帆布高腰水靴成功，现在已经和中国百货公司旅大采购供应批发站签订了产销合同，正式生产。
    过去，旅大地区因为制造高腰水靴用的橡胶不足，所以高腰水靴一向供不应求。旅大采购供应批发站商品研究员张起超和岳永庆两人经过研究后，认为具有防水性能的亚麻帆布可以代替橡胶，制高腰水靴的靴腰，这样高腰水靴就可以大量生产，满足人民需要。这个建议得到大连橡胶工厂领导人员和职工的欢迎，经过该厂职工三次试制，克服了技术和操作上的困难，终于获得成功。
    试制成功的亚麻帆布高腰水靴质量和全用橡胶制成的水靴质量相同，而且价格低廉，据初步统计，每双可贱四万元左右。用亚麻帆布制靴腰，所节省的胶料，以批发站全年高腰水靴进货量推算，可做三万七千余双力士鞋。
    美丽新颖的花布越来越多
    在华东纺织管理局的打样室里，每天都有美丽新颖的花样被设计出来。在许多设计人员中，有一个年轻的设计人员，名叫吴智音，她是去年夏天从中央美术学院毕业后参加工作的。还在学习的时候，她就搜集了许多故宫图案、民间剪纸；一年来，她参考这些古典和民间艺术反复研究而设计的二十多种花样，都已经印出布来了。
    今年四月中，打样室设计人员和中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站等单位一起，带了各色花布和六百多种样本到农村去开花布展览会，征求农民的意见。以便根据广大农民们的爱好来设计更多的新花样。
    现在，当人们还在购买漂亮的夏季花布的时候，一批批新的冬季深色布花样已经被送进印染厂去了。今年冬天，人们将可以买到素静大方的“雪花呢”、美丽多采的“蝶恋花”等各种不同花样的
  花布。
    “乌克兰”式放映机
    我国第一家制造电影放映机的国营工厂——国营南京电影机械厂开办两年多以来，已经生产了一千多台放映机，供应了全国各地的需要。今年该厂要制造大批“乌克兰”式放映机，为全国各地装备起更多的放映队。“乌克兰”式放映机是一种轻便的新型放映机，更能适应野外放映时场地空旷、观众多的要求。现在，这个电影机械厂已制成了五十台“乌克兰”式放映机。
    漂亮的搪瓷品
    吉林搪瓷厂技术员朱肇志和工人一起试制汰白奶黄珐琅成功。使用这种珐琅可制出比用锑铂珐琅色彩更美、光泽更好、瓷更细致、成本也更低的奶黄色的搪瓷品来。
    我国过去都用锑铂珐琅制造各种搪瓷品，不会制汰白奶黄珐琅。去年，朱肇志去上海参观，听说捷克斯洛伐克等国有一种汰白奶黄珐琅，用这种珐琅不加任何色素，就能搪制出各种漂亮的奶黄色产品。朱肇志回到工厂后，就开始试制这种珐琅。工作进行得很不顺利，一连试制了七次都没成功。汰白奶黄珐琅本来是非常新鲜的，他做出的珐琅却乌涂涂的像一团泥。但朱肇志没有灰心，继续试制，并经常找老工人一起研究，经过一年多的艰苦努力，终于把汰白奶黄珐琅试制成功了。
    用发酵法制造葡萄糖酸钙成功
    中央人民政府轻工业部上海工业试验所，研究用发酵法制造葡萄糖酸钙成功。
    葡萄糖酸钙是医药上应用很广的钙质药剂，凡患有缺乏钙质的慢性病的人可以服用，尤其是孕妇、哺乳妇和幼儿更为需要。
    葡萄糖酸钙又是制造血吸虫病的特效药——葡萄糖酸锑钠的主要原料。此外，新近兽医学上也采用葡萄糖酸钙来治疗乳牛的乳热病。所以每年所需葡萄糖酸钙的用量为数甚巨。
    过去，我国虽曾有一些制药厂用电解法来制造葡萄糖酸钙，但由于电解法的效率低，生产成本高，不适宜大量生产，所以大部供应仍由国外输入。
    中央人民政府轻工业部上海工业试验所自一九五三年四月和国营山东新华制药厂签订用发酵法制造葡萄糖酸钙的合同后，在该所发酵组研究人员的不断努力下，已经制造成功。用发酵法来制造葡萄糖酸钙，非但品质优良，成本降低，而且产量要比电解法提高一倍以上，适宜大量生产。
    现在该所已将全部研究结果送交国营山东新华药厂。预计下半年就可以正式生产，供应全国人民的需要。
    大量生产时效八小时的防蚊油
    国营南京制药厂试制防蚊油成功，并开始大量生产。最近已有二十多万瓶运往各地。
    南京制药厂试制成功的防蚊油防虫效能很强。人体擦用一次防蚊油，可以保持八小时不受任何昆虫叮咬。这种油比过去美国制造的避蚊油能防止的叮咬虫类要多，保持不被叮咬的时间要长一倍以上，而价格则便宜三分之一。这种防蚊油略有香味，擦用时对人的皮肤不含刺激作用，也不沾人的衣服。现在各地已有很多单位向南京制药厂订购，东北森林工业管理局就订购二十万瓶。为满足各单位需要，这个厂的职工积极地改进操作技术，使产量日益提高。
    云南出产的色布
    云南省新建了一座漂染厂，该省人民可以买到本省出产的各种色布了。
    解放以来，云南省纺织工业有了一定程度的发展，特别是去年云南纺织厂布场扩建以后，布匹的产量增加了约十倍，但与此相适应的现代化漂染工业却完全没有。这样，广大农村姑娘们最喜爱的紫红布、机关干部穿的灰布和老年人、中年人穿的安安蓝布、黑布等各种色布，仍然要从省外调拨。
    新建的云南漂染厂不但有漂染一般低级色布的设备，还有能漂染高档色布的烧毛机，丝光机、纳夫妥机（安安蓝机），以及整理布匹的拉幅机、码布机等。同样的毛胚布、经过烧毛、丝光等工序再染色后，不但颜色光泽好，同时又比较耐穿。
    沈阳毛织厂将增产哔叽、绒线
    沈阳毛织厂今年要修复一座三千二百多平方公尺锯齿形的梳毛场房，现在已经开始动工了。在这个场房里将安装一整套梳毛机。同时，还要在现有的场房里安装复式立毛机、立毛准备机、割绒机、破捻机、蒸烘机等。到了一九五五年，该厂哔叽、绒线的产量就要大大提高了。如果以每天八小时生产量计算，全年多生产的哔叽，就可以做四万一千  六百套哔叽制服；多生产的绒线，就可以使十五万九千四百多人每人穿上一套毛衣毛裤。该厂扩建完成后，还可以生产过去不能生产的立毛绒。
