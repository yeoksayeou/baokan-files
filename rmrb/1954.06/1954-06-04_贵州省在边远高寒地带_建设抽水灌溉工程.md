Guizhou Provincial People's Government Agricultural and Forestry Department Water Conservancy Bureau, in order to help ethnic minorities in remote high-altitude areas overcome the threat of drought, is constructing a mechanical pumping irrigation project in Libo County. This work has been warmly welcomed by local farmers, who are automatically helping the installation personnel with their work. Therefore, the station construction project is progressing very smoothly and will be able to pump water for farming in early June. After the completion of the project, more than 800 mu of rice paddies on both sides of the Zhang River can completely avoid the dangers of drought.

In the past few years, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government has successively helped fraternal ethnic groups in high-altitude areas develop the large water source of Yudan Mountain, built the Maolan and "Little West Lake" large reservoirs, as well as many new ditches, canals, ponds, and weirs, making many lands into fertile fields free from drought and flood, and capable of obtaining bumper harvests every year.

    贵州省在边远高寒地带
    建设抽水灌溉工程
    贵州省人民政府农林厅水利局为了帮助边远高寒地带的少数民族战胜旱灾威胁，正在荔波县建设
  一处机械抽水灌溉工程。这一工作受到了当地农民的热烈欢迎，他们自动地帮助安装人员进行工作，因而建站工程开展得十分顺利，六月上旬便可抽水养田。工程完成后，樟河两岸的八百余亩稻田可以完全避免旱灾的危害。
    过去几年中，贵州省人民政府曾先后帮助高寒地区兄弟民族开发了鱼胆山的大水源，兴修了茂兰和“小西湖”大水库，以及不少新的沟、渠、塘、堰，使很多土地变成了水旱无忧的良田，可以年年获得丰产。（丁亦侬）
