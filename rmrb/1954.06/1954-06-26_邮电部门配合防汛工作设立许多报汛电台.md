    The postal and telecommunications departments are deploying personnel to establish numerous flood reporting radio stations along rivers and waterways to meet the needs of water conservancy and flood control work. The Yellow River system's flood reporting radio stations will be established and begin communication before July 1st; personnel for the remaining river systems' flood reporting radio stations have departed successively and have already begun communication. The radio stations that have been established and are communicating are experiencing good communication conditions.
    Every year during the flood season, the postal and telecommunications departments send personnel to establish flood reporting radio stations at the flood control stations of water conservancy and flood control agencies in various locations along rivers and waterways that do not have telecommunications bureaus. This is done to quickly transmit flood information, promptly direct flood control efforts, and protect the industrial and agricultural production and the lives and property of the people on both sides of the rivers from the disasters of river flooding. The number of these flood reporting radio stations is increasing year by year; this year, it has increased by 83 percent compared to 1950. In addition, to ensure the safe production of hydropower stations is not affected by flood conditions, the postal and telecommunications departments have specially dispatched personnel to establish a batch of flood reporting radio stations.
    In order to ensure that this task is completed even better, the postal and telecommunications departments and the water conservancy departments have made full preparations in advance this year. The postal and telecommunications departments organized telegraph personnel to undergo short-term training before departure, stipulated the communication methods for flood reporting radio stations, and simplified the methods for sending identical text telegrams, making telegram transmission faster and more accurate.

    邮电部门配合防汛工作设立许多报汛电台
    邮电部门为配合水利防汛工作的需要，正派出人员在沿江沿河设立许多报汛电台。黄河系统的报汛电台将在七月一日前设立通报；其余各江河系统的报汛电台人员已先后出发，并已开始通报。已设立通报的电台，通信情况都很好。
    每年到了汛期，在没有电信局的沿江、沿河各处的水利防汛机关的防汛站，都要由邮电部门派出人员设立报汛电台，以便迅速传达汛情，及时指挥防汛，保障江河两岸的工农业生产和人民生命财产免受河水泛滥的灾害。这些报汛电台的数量是逐年增加的，今年就比一九五零年增加百分之八十三。另外，邮电部门为保障水力发电站的安全生产不受汛情影响，专门派出人员设立了一批报汛电台。
    为了保证这一任务完成得更好，邮电部门和水利部门今年在事前都作了充分的准备工作。邮电部门组织电报人员在出发前进行短期训练，规定了报汛电台通报办法，简化了同文电报拍发办法，使电报传递更加迅速准确。　（新华社）
