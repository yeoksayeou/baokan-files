The Beijing Film Actors Troupe Undertakes Systematic Study

    The Beijing Film Actors Troupe has been conducting systematic political and professional studies since early November of last year. In terms of political study, the focus was on the general task of the nation during the transition period. The study enabled the actors to clearly understand the tasks of the film industry in the process of the country's transition to a socialist society, to clearly understand that film actors should strive to create typical character images, especially the images of advanced heroic figures, and to profoundly and vividly guide the broad masses of working people towards a better socialist society.
    In terms of professional study, because the vast majority of actors had not undergone systematic study of acting theory in the past, this time they all seriously studied Stanislavsky's "An Actor Prepares," Volume 1, and referred to books such as Abalakin's "The Stanislavsky System and Soviet Drama." After more than three months of study, they gained a preliminary, comprehensive, and holistic understanding of the basic spirit of the Stanislavsky system. They realized that mastering the Stanislavsky system means mastering the creative method of socialist realism in acting, and understood that the art of experience starts from life and requires reflecting the truth of life. The actors also examined their own performances.
    The study was conducted on the basis of self-study. After reading books, they held informal talks and discussions. At the same time, in order to integrate the study of performance theory with practice, they rehearsed three one-act plays: "Two Sisters," "People Strive for Progress," and "Moon Bay." They are now preparing to study articles such as "In-depth Study and Creative Development of Stanislavsky's Legacy," "Striving for Further Improvement in Stage Art," and "Preparation for Roles," to further understand and study the Stanislavsky system.

    Viewing Czechoslovakian Puppet Art

    The Czechoslovakian Puppet Show Exhibition has been loved and praised by visitors from all walks of life since it opened in Beijing. During the exhibition, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Chinese Dramatists Association invited drama, art, and puppet show experts to hold a symposium. Those attending included Hong Shen, A Ying, Lao She, Chen Baichen, and Wu Cun, totaling more than twenty people. At the symposium, they believed that the Czechoslovakian puppet show exhibition in China is of great significance. In Czechoslovakia, whether during the dark era of fascist rule or after liberation, puppet shows have always maintained close ties with the people, exposing the darkness of the old society and praising the peaceful and happy life after the people's liberation. Under the care of the Party, government, and people of Czechoslovakia, the art of puppet shows has achieved vigorous development and high achievements. This is inseparable from the dramatists providing it with good scripts, the artists creating vivid and typical images for the characters in the play, and the musicians composing beautiful music that is suitable for the development of the plot. Therefore, it can also fully exert the characteristics of comprehensive art.
    At the meeting, comrades who had visited Czechoslovakia also introduced the warm welcome that puppet shows receive from Czechoslovakian children. Czechoslovakian artists have spent a lot of time collecting and studying the psychological state of children and the language they like, and through the artistic form of puppet shows, they cultivate children's wit, courage, and clear-cut feelings of love and hatred.
    The participants all believed that this exhibition has given great encouragement to our Chinese puppet show workers. Our country's puppet shows have a long history and a unique national style. Our puppet artists will learn from the advanced experience of Czechoslovakian puppet artists to promote our country's classical puppet show art tradition. (Rui Ning)

    Holding a "Literary Works Recitation"

    In order to enrich the people's cultural life and improve the people's literary appreciation ability, the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles recently invited literary and art workers and propaganda work cadres from industrial, mining, and mass organizations to hold a "Literary Works Recitation." Those who performed the recitation were mostly writers and actors. The recited works included excerpts from Mayakovsky's long poem "Good!" written to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the writer Ai Wu's novella "Returning Home at Night" describing the new appearance of young workers and rural women, the narrative poem "Ashima" that has been circulating among the Sani people of Yunnan for a long time, praising labor, freedom, and love, as well as some excellent works by Chongqing workers. This recitation is a new attempt by the literary and art circles in Chongqing and will continue to be held in the future. (Zhang Caizhen)

    Literary and Art Festival Promotes Employee Amateur Literary and Art Activities

    Harbin City held the city's sixth Employee Literary and Art Festival in March. In this festival, through mutual observation, exchange of experience, and rewarding excellent performances, excellent works, and amateur literary and art workers, the participants further clarified the orientation and importance of employee amateur literary and art activities, and effectively promoted employee amateur literary and art activities. After the meeting, the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant immediately formulated an amateur literary and art activity plan based on the specific situation of the plant and in conjunction with the central work of the second quarter, and designated a special person to be responsible. At the same time, it also corrected the past chaotic phenomenon of only doing rush performances to celebrate festivals. The Harbin Flax Textile Factory reorganized its literary and art activity organization, and in order to improve the level of literary and art activities, it opened an amateur music training class.
    The festival also greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of amateur literary and art workers in various units and increased the interest of employees in participating in literary and art activities. For example, Yan Boyu, a female worker from the Harbin Flax Textile Factory who won the Excellent Actor Award at the conference, actively led workers in her workshop to rehearse Ping opera programs such as "Xiao Gu Xian" and "Liu Hai Cutting Firewood" during the "May 1st" International Labor Day, which were warmly welcomed by all workers. Hu Hengchang, an old worker of fifty-three years from the Harbin Cigarette Factory, also took out the dulcimer he had stored for many years and actively participated in amateur literary and art activities.

    提高艺术修养，努力艺术实践
    北京电影演员剧团进行系统的学习
    北京电影演员剧团自去年十一月初起开始系统的政治学习和业务学习。政治学习方面，着重学习了国家过渡时期的总任务。学习使演员们明确认识了电影事业在国家过渡到社会主义社会的过程中的任务，明确认识了电影演员要努力创造典型人物形象，特别是先进的英雄人物的形象，深刻地、生动地引导广大的劳动人民走向美好的社会主义。
    业务学习方面，由于演员绝大多数过去未经过系统的表演理论学习，这次都认真学习了史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的“演员自我修养”第一卷，参考了阿巴尔金的“史达尼斯拉夫斯基体系与苏联戏剧”等书。经过三个多月的钻研，对史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系的基本精神有了初步的较全面、较整体的认识。认识到掌握了史氏体系也就能在表演上掌握社会主义现实主义的创造方法；了解了体验艺术是从生活出发，它要求反映生活的真实。演员们并检查了自己的表演。
    学习是在自学的基础上进行的，他们在阅读书籍后，并进行了漫谈、讨论；同时，为了使表演理论的学习能与实践相结合，并排练了“姐妹俩”、
  “人往高处走”、“月亮湾”等三个独幕剧。现正准备学习“深刻地研究和创造地发展史坦尼斯拉夫斯基的遗产”、“争取舞台艺术底进一步提高”、
  “角色的准备”等文章，对史坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系作更进一步的理解与研究。　（吴青）
    观摩捷克斯洛伐克木偶艺术
    捷克斯洛伐克木偶戏展览，在北京开幕以来，受到了各界参观者的喜爱与赞扬。在展览期间，中国文学艺术界联合会和中国戏剧家协会曾邀请了戏剧、美术、木偶戏专家举行了座谈会，到会的有洪深、阿英、老舍、陈白尘、吴村等二十余人。在座谈会中，他们认为：捷克斯洛伐克木偶戏在中国展览是有很大意义的。在捷克斯洛伐克无论是在法西斯统治的黑暗时代，或解放以后，木偶戏总和人民保持着紧密的联系，揭发了旧社会的黑暗，歌颂了人民解放后和平幸福的生活。在捷克斯洛伐克党、政府、人民的关怀下，木偶戏艺术获得了蓬勃的发展和高度的成就。这与戏剧家供给它好的剧本、美术家为剧中人物创造出生动典型的形象、音乐家为它配作了优美而适合剧情发展的乐曲分不开的，因此它也能够充分地发挥了综合性艺术的特质。
    会上，曾访问过捷克斯洛伐克的同志还介绍了木偶戏受到捷克斯洛伐克儿童热烈欢迎的情况。捷克斯洛伐克的艺术家们，花了很多时间去搜集和研究儿童的心理状态，和儿童喜爱的语言，通过木偶戏的艺术形式，来培养儿童的机智、勇敢、爱憎分明的思想感情。
    与会者都认为：这次展览会给了我们中国的木偶戏工作者很大的鼓舞。我国的木偶戏具有悠久的历史和独特的民族风格。我们的木偶艺术家将学习捷克斯洛伐克木偶艺术家们的先进经验，以发扬我国的古典木偶戏艺术传统。　（瑞宁）
    举办“文学作品朗诵会”
    重庆市文学艺术界联合会为了丰富人民文化生活，提高人民文学欣赏力，最近邀请文艺工作者和工矿、群众团体的宣传工作干部，举办了“文学作品朗诵会”。担任朗诵的大都是作家和演员，朗诵的作品有马雅可夫斯基为纪念苏联十月革命十周年而写的长诗“好啊”的片断，作家艾芜的描写青年工人和农村妇女新的面貌的小说“夜归”，云南撒尼族人民长期流传的歌颂劳动、自由与爱情的叙事诗“阿诗玛”，以及重庆市工人的一些优秀作品。这次朗诵会是重庆市文艺界一个新的尝试，今后还将继续举办。　（张彩珍）
    文艺会演推动职工业余文艺活动
    哈尔滨市曾在三月份举行了全市第六届职工文艺会演大会，在这次会演中，通过互相观摩、交流经验，和奖励优秀的演出、优秀的作品和业余文艺工作者，使与会者进一步明确了职工业余文艺活动的方针和重要性，有力地推动了职工业余文艺活动。会后，哈尔滨车辆厂即根据厂里的具体情况，结合第二季度中心工作，订出了业余文艺活动计划，指定了专人负责；同时，也纠正了过去只为庆祝节日才作突击演出的忙乱现象。哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂整顿了文艺活动组织，并为提高文艺活动水平，开办了业余音乐训练班。
    会演也大大鼓舞了各单位业余文艺工作者的工作热情，提高了职工参加文艺活动的兴趣。如获得大会优秀演员奖的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂的女工颜伯玉，在“五一”国际劳动节时，就积极带领本车间工人，排演了评剧“小姑贤”、“刘海砍樵”等节目，受到全体工人热烈欢迎；哈尔滨制烟厂五十三年的老工人胡恒昌，也把他存放了多年的洋琴拿出来，积极参加业余文艺活动。　（逢雁）
