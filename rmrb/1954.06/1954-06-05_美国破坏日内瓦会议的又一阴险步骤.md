    Another Insidious Step by the U.S. to Sabotage the Geneva Conference
    Wu Quan
    Just as the Geneva Conference reached its first agreement on promoting a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina as soon as possible, another cold arrow aimed at sabotaging the Geneva Conference was shot from across the Atlantic by the United States. Under the direct instruction of Dulles, the Thai representative to the United Nations, Mr. Kohmant, submitted to the United Nations Security Council on May 29 a "proposal" requesting the discussion of sending an "observation group" to Indochina. On June 1, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge took advantage of his turn as President of the Security Council to convene a meeting of the Security Council on the 3rd, and, disregarding the legitimate opposition of the Soviet representative, included Thailand's "proposal" on the Security Council's agenda. However, the United States' long-planned adventurous step of using the United Nations to expand its interference in the Indochina war has aroused dissatisfaction and opposition from peace-loving people of all countries and countries willing to see an easing of international tensions.
    When Thai representative Kohmant submitted this adventurous request to the Security Council, he used the excuse that the situation in Indochina was "a threat to Thailand's security." But this excuse cannot hide the fact that he is faithfully executing Washington's orders. Indeed, the U.S.'s actions of interfering in the Indochina war and trying to expand it have long constituted the most serious threat to peace in Southeast Asia, Asia, and even the world. The people of Indochina and the people of all countries, especially all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and Southeast Asia, have unanimously called for an end to this war and resolutely opposed U.S. interference. But what has the Thai ruling group done during this period? It has not only turned a deaf ear to this call for peace but has also actively acted as a pawn for the U.S. in expanding the war, handing over dozens of air force bases within the country to U.S. adventurers, stationing troops on the Cambodian and Laotian borders and announcing a "state of martial law," and docilely being dragged by the U.S. to the dangerous edge of interfering in the Indochina war. Now, the opportunity that the people of all countries have consistently longed for, to eliminate the threat of war and end the Indochina war, has appeared, and the issue of a ceasefire in Indochina has begun to be discussed in Geneva and has made some progress; however, Thailand has suddenly cried out about some kind of "threat." This blatantly shows that what the Thai ruling group cares about is not international peace and security but only the setbacks that the U.S.'s policy of expanding the Indochina war has suffered. The French "Le Monde" pointed out in an editorial on May 29: "Bangkok has announced that Thai territory is not threatened, therefore this action is preparing for collective intervention (in the Indochina war)." This exposes the conspiracy being played out in the United Nations by the likes of Lodge and Kohmant.
    This farce of manufacturing UN intervention was entirely directed by Dulles. When Kohmant hurriedly flew from Geneva to New York to the United Nations, the French "Combat" immediately pointed out: "According to reliable sources, it can be confirmed that this initiative by the Bangkok government was entirely proposed after instructions from the U.S. State Department." Prior to this, U.S. diplomatic personnel had carried out a series of activities from New York to Geneva, from Washington to the capitals of many Western countries, to plan the transfer of the Indochina issue to the United Nations. The U.S. propaganda machine admitted that what Dulles was considering was only the question of who to send, and "with what strategy" and "at what time" to formally propose it. By May 25, the United Press International openly declared that this conspiracy plan was "almost completely completed," and the United States had designated Thailand as a mouthpiece, waiting only for "the United States to send the final signal," and Thailand would "appeal" to the United Nations. Sure enough, when Dulles announced at a press conference in Washington that "if someone makes such an appeal, the United States will support it," the next day, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge "hosted a banquet" for Thai Representative Kohmant and representatives of other countries participating in the Korean War to discuss Thailand's "proposal" and put pressure on certain countries. Immediately afterward, Thailand submitted the "proposal" to the Security Council. Could there be a more ugly performance of such a double act on the international stage!
    Transferring the Indochina issue to the United Nations is what U.S. war instigators have been pursuing day and night for the past six months. Since the peaceful proposition expressed by President Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam to the Swedish "Expressen" on November 26 last year aroused enthusiastic responses around the world, especially in French public opinion, the United States has attempted to take over and expand the Indochina war through the United Nations. Last December and this April, the U.S. successively instructed the puppet regimes of Laos and Cambodia to submit "appeals" to the UN Secretary-General, and Dulles openly wrote letters of encouragement. U.S. reactionary public opinion issued a series of calls for the United Nations to intervene in the Indochina war. On May 8 this year, the same day that the Geneva Conference began discussing the Indochina issue, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Lodge shouted in New York that the United States was still considering bringing the Indochina issue to the United Nations. In recent days, because the Geneva Conference began to make progress against the wishes of the United States, Dulles' activities to piece together the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and hold French-American talks to undermine the Geneva Conference and expand the Indochina war were not very satisfactory. Therefore, the U.S. ruling group recklessly used the United Nations in an attempt to intervene.
    As Soviet representative Tsarapkin pointed out, this hasty and reckless behavior by the United States is to obstruct the Geneva Conference and prepare conditions for it to expand its intervention in the Indochina war. The "Hindustan Times" also pointed out that "there is no doubt that the result of doing so is to internationalize the Indochina war"; it is "an attempt to replace the Geneva Conference with the United Nations...rather than an attempt to increase the possibility that the Geneva Conference will reach a ceasefire in Indochina and establish the basis for a final political settlement, which the Geneva Conference is by no means without." Even the U.S. ruling group does not hide this. Dulles reiterated at a press conference on May 25 that the purpose of doing so was to seek the United Nations' "moral approval" for the United States to directly participate in the Indochina war. U.S. warmonger and Chief of Naval Operations Carney more frantically clamored that "the options before the United States now are the same as in 1950...but now they are more serious than ever before."
    From this, it can be seen how anxious the U.S. ruling group is about the progress made by the Geneva Conference in discussing the Indochina issue, and how eager it is to create new intervention by the United Nations to expand the Indochina war. Everyone will not forget that in 1947, in order to split Korea and create war, the United States also began by betraying the agreement of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference and illegally submitting the Korean issue to the United Nations. When Dulles personally went to Korea in June 1950 to plan the war of aggression, he also sent a group of so-called UN "observers" to operate near the "38th parallel" beforehand, and then used their fabricated "reports" to create an illegal resolution in the Security Council. What Dulles wants to do today is exactly the same old trick.
    Dulles, Smith, and others at the Geneva Conference repeatedly and shamelessly talked about how the United States "respects" the "power and moral strength of the United Nations"; however, their hypocritical and shameless words have never been able to conceal the fact that the United States placed the United Nations in the position of a belligerent party in the Korean War, and seriously insulted and damaged the UN's moral authority. Now the United States wants to trample on the UN flag again on the Indochina battlefield, putting the United Nations in danger of eternal destruction. According to a report in the French "Le Monde" on May 28, some Western delegations to the United Nations also admitted that "if the United Nations is mainly to support U.S. military intervention in the Far East, it will be ruined."
    It is precisely because of this that world public opinion and all those who are willing to promote the Geneva Conference to seek the restoration of peace in Indochina express dissatisfaction and opposition to this behavior by the United States, which is completely understandable. According to a report by the International News Service on May 29, "France, along with Britain, still believes that immediate discussion in the Security Council may jeopardize the Geneva Conference." French Representative to the United Nations Hoppenot also told Western reporters on May 28: "When it is possible to seek a solution to the Indochina issue at the Geneva Conference, bringing this issue to the United Nations will only undermine this prospect." However, after the United States used Thailand to create a fait accompli, a spokesman for the French Embassy in the United States said: "France originally hoped that Thailand would make this suggestion later, but now that it has come to this, France fully agrees and supports it." This contradictory attitude of France echoes its current two-faced approach to the Indochina issue. French public opinion shows that the French public does not agree with this approach. Britain should not create a position that is detrimental to itself on this issue either.
    Now, the true moral authority of the United Nations is again seriously threatened by the new conspiracy of U.S. adventurers. Any country willing to uphold the UN Charter and restore the United Nations as a tool for peace has a responsibility to stop this new conspiracy by the United States. Countries that are willing to restore peace in Indochina should not allow this conspiracy by the United States to succeed. Soviet representative Tsarapkin has solemnly expressed opposition to the Security Council discussing the issue raised by Thailand at the Security Council. This is a just stance that truly safeguards the United Nations and seeks peace in Indochina. The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's position and resolutely oppose the United Nations being used again by the United States as a tool to expand the Indochina war.

    美国破坏日内瓦会议的又一阴险步骤
    吴全
    正当日内瓦会议就促进早日在印度支那全境同时停战的问题达成了第一个协议的时候，美国破坏日内瓦会议的另一枝冷箭又从大西洋对岸射出来了。在杜勒斯的直接指使之下，泰国驻联合国代表科曼在五月二十九日向联合国安全理事会提出它要求讨论派遣“观察团”到印度支那去的“建议”。六月一日美国驻联合国代表洛奇就利用他轮值安理会主席的便利，在三日召开了安理会会议，并不顾苏联代表的正当的反对，把泰国的“建议”列入安理会的议程。但是，美国策划已久的利用联合国扩大干涉印度支那战争的冒险步骤，引起了各国爱好和平的人民和愿意看到国际紧张局势缓和的国家的不满和反对。
    泰国代表科曼在向安理会提出这一冒险的要求时，借口所谓印度支那的情势“对于泰国的安全是一种威胁”。但是这种借口丝毫也不能掩饰他是在忠实地执行华盛顿的命令。的确，美国干涉印度支那战争并力图加以扩大的行为，早就构成了对东南亚、亚洲以至世界和平的最严重的威胁。印度支那人民和各国人民，尤其是亚洲和东南亚所有爱好和平的国家和人民，一致呼吁停止这一战争、坚决反对美国的干涉。但是，泰国统治集团在这一时期做了些什么呢？它不仅对这个和平呼吁充耳不闻，而且积极地充当美国扩大战争的马前卒，把国内的数十处空军基地交给美国冒险家，陈兵高棉和寮国边界并宣布“进入戒严状态”，驯服地被美国拖到干涉印度支那战争的危险边缘。现在，各国人民所一贯渴望的解除战争威胁、停止印度支那战争的机会出现了，印度支那停战问题已在日内瓦开始讨论并获得一些进展；可是，泰国却又突然叫起什么“威胁”来了。这就露骨地表明，泰国统治集团所关心的不是国际和平与安全，而只是因为美国扩大印度支那战争的政策受到了挫折。法国“世界报”在五月二十九日的社论中指出：“曼谷方面已宣布，泰国领土并未受到威胁，因此这一举止乃是准备着（对印度支那战争的）集体的干预”。这就把洛奇、科曼之流在联合国玩弄的阴谋和盘托出了。
    这场制造联合国干涉的把戏，完全是杜勒斯一手导演的。当科曼匆匆忙忙从日内瓦飞赴纽约去联合国的时候，法国“战斗报”立刻指出：“据可靠消息，可以肯定曼谷政府的这个倡议完全是在美国国务院授意之后提出的。”在此以前，美国外交人员从纽约到日内瓦、从华盛顿到西方许多国家的首都，为策划把印度支那问题搬到联合国去展开了一系列的活动。美国宣传机器承认，杜勒斯所考虑的只是派遣谁、以及“用什么战略”、“在什么时候”正式提出的问题。到五月二十五日，合众社公然宣称这个阴谋计划“差不多完全完成了”，美国已指定泰国当传声筒，只等“美国发出最后信号”，泰国就要向联合国“呼吁”。果然，当杜勒斯在华盛顿的记者招待会上宣布“如果有人提出这样的呼吁，美国会支持它”之后，第二天，美国驻联合国代表洛奇就“设宴招待”泰国代表科曼和其他参加侵朝战争国家的代表，讨论泰国的“建议”并对某些国家施用压力。紧跟着，泰国就向安理会提出了
  “建议”。还有比这样的双簧在国际舞台上表演得更丑恶的么！
    把印度支那问题搬到联合国去，这是半年来美国战争挑拨者所旦夕追求着的。自从去年十一月二十六日越南胡志明主席向瑞典“快报”所表示的和平主张在全世界、特别是在法国舆论中引起了热烈反响之后，美国就企图通过联合国来接管和扩大印度支那战争。去年十二月和今年四月，美国先后指使寮国和高棉的傀儡政权向联合国秘书处提出“呼吁”，杜勒斯并公开去信鼓励。美国反动舆论发出了一连串的由联合国干涉印度支那战争的叫嚣。今年五月八日日内瓦会议开始讨论印度支那问题的同一天，美国驻联合国代表洛奇就在纽约叫喊说，美国仍在考虑把印度支那问题提到联合国去。最近这些天来，由于日内瓦会议不合美国的意愿而开始获得进展，杜勒斯拼凑东南亚侵略集团和举行法美会谈等来破坏日内瓦会议和扩大印度支那战争的活动，并不怎么称心，于是，美国统治集团就不顾一切地来利用联合国企图进行干涉了。
    正如苏联代表查拉普金所指出的，美国这种迫不及待的胡作非为，是为了阻挠日内瓦会议，替它扩大干涉印度支那战争准备条件。“印度斯坦时报”也指出，“毫无疑问，这样做的结果就是使印度支那战争国际化”；就是“企图以联合国代替日内瓦会议……而不是企图增进日内瓦会议达成印度支那的停火和确立最后的政治解决的基础的可能性，而日内瓦会议绝不是没有这种可能性的”。就连美国统治集团也毫不掩饰这一点。杜勒斯在五月二十五日的记者招待会上就再度表明，这样做是为了给美国直接参与印度支那战争寻求联合国的“道义上的认可”。美国好战分子、海军作战部长卡湼更疯狂地叫嚣，“现在摆在美国前面的可供抉择的办法与一九五○年……一样——但是现在它们要比过去任何时候都更为严重”。
    由此可见，美国统治集团对日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题取得的进展是如何的焦虑，它是怎样地急于要制造联合国的新的干涉来扩大印度支那战争。大家不会忘记，美国在一九四七年为了分裂朝鲜、制造战争，也是从背弃莫斯科三国外长会议的协议、非法地硬把朝鲜问题提交联合国而开始的。一九五○年六月杜勒斯亲赴朝鲜策划侵略战争时，也是事先派一批所谓联合国“观察员”到“三八”线附近去活动，然后假手他们捏造的“报告”来在安理会造成非法决议的。杜勒斯今天想走的正就是当年的老路。
    杜勒斯、史密斯之流在日内瓦会议上一再大言不惭地说什么美国如何“尊重”“联合国的权力和道义力量”；但是，他们的这种伪善和无耻的言词，始终无法掩饰美国在侵朝战争中把联合国置于交战一方的地位，并严重地污辱和损害了联合国的道义权威。现在美国又想在印度支那战场上来践踏联合国的旗帜，使联合国遭到万劫不复的威胁了。据法国“世界报”五月二十八日报道，联合国的某些西方代表团也承认，“如果联合国仅仅主要是为了给美国在远东军事干预以撑腰的话，它将一蹶不振”。
    正是因为这样，世界公众舆论和一切愿意促进日内瓦会议来谋求恢复印度支那和平的人士对美国这种行径表示不满和反对，是完全可以理解的。据五月二十九日国际新闻社报道称，“法国仍和英国一起认为，立即在安全理事会上进行讨论可能会危害日内瓦会议。”法国驻联合国代表奥培诺五月二十八日也曾对西方记者说：“在有可能在日内瓦会议上就印度支那问题求得解决的时候，如果把这个问题提到联合国来，那只会破坏这种前途。”但是，在美国假手泰国造成既成事实之后，法国驻美大使馆发言人又说：“法国原来希望泰国以后再提出这个建议，但是事已至此，法国完全表示同意，并予以支持。”法国这种前后矛盾的态度，是和它目前在印度支那问题上玩弄的两面手法相呼应的。法国舆论表明法国公众不同意这样的做法。英国也不应该在这个问题上造成对自己不利的地位。
    现在，联合国真正的道义权威又受到美国冒险家新阴谋的严重威胁，任何愿意维护联合国宪章、恢复联合国作为和平工具的国家，都有责任制止美国的这个新阴谋。愿意恢复印度支那和平的国家，也不应该使美国这个阴谋得逞。苏联代表查拉普金已在安理会上严正表示反对安理会讨论泰国提出的问题。这是真正维护联合国和谋求印度支那和平的正义立场。中国人民完全支持苏联的主张，坚决反对联合国再度被美国利用来作为扩大印度支那战争的工具。
