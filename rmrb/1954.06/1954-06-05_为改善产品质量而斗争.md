Editorial:

    From the perspective of fulfilling the gross output value plan, the production of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises from January to April this year was generally good. The six central industrial ministries actually completed 105% of their gross output value plan for the first quarter, a 132% increase compared to the same period last year, and a 102% increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year (calculated by working days); April also completed 103.9% of the monthly plan. This shows that state-owned industry has begun to change the old habit of "slack at the beginning of the year, tight at the end," which is a progress in enterprise production management.
    However, during this period, there were still some shortcomings and problems in enterprise leadership. A particularly prominent issue was that the product quality standards of some state-owned factories and mines, as well as local state-owned factories and mines, were unstable, and the amount of waste and substandard products increased. The quality of some products from some enterprises even showed a downward trend compared to the previous month and quarter. For example, the compressive strength of some cement factory products in the first quarter of this year was lower than in the past; the quality of castings in some machinery manufacturing factories was still inconsistent, and the precision of certain products did not meet the required standards; the yarn breakage rate in some spinning mills also increased; and the quality of certain brands of cigarettes also declined. Similar situations existed to varying degrees and were fairly widespread in various regions and industrial sectors. This phenomenon deserves the deep attention of cadres and economic workers at all levels of enterprises.
    The reason for poor or inconsistent product quality is that some enterprise leaders have varying degrees and forms of complacency. They are content with the status quo, satisfied with their existing achievements, and stagnate. These comrades seem to feel that since there are no problems with the sales of the current products, their quality is also "not a problem"; or they believe that product quality has already greatly improved, and further improvement is unlikely; or they show blind confidence in the quality of the products produced by their own units; some attribute all the reasons for poor product quality to external conditions; or they believe that some technical problems causing poor product quality are fundamentally unsolvable. Because of these one-sided ideas, efforts to improve product quality are hindered subjectively.
    Poor quality of some products from some factories and mines is related to the one-sided task view of the staff in these units, who simply pursue product quantity and neglect product quality. These comrades only care about pursuing product quantity (of course, ensuring the completion of the plan is necessary), while neglecting other planned indicators and requirements, pitting increased production against improved product quality, failing to consider the economic effect and political impact of a substandard product, and failing to take effective measures to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of the state plan. This cannot but reduce the overall work performance of these enterprises. Because simply pursuing quantity and producing unqualified products will cause significant damage to the country.
    Poor product quality is also due to the fact that the quality management work in some enterprises is not sound. Some factories and mines lack certain product quality standards and technical operating procedures; or although there are product quality standards and technical operating procedures, they are not entirely suitable for the new situation and should be supplemented and revised in a timely manner but have not been; or there are product quality standards and operating procedures but they are not well implemented; some factories and mines also lack a sound quality responsibility system, and when a certain part, component, or product is found to be of poor quality, no one can be found specifically responsible. In particular, due to the lack of strict technical inspection of raw materials, technical supervision in the process, and product ex-factory inspection systems, problematic products are even allowed to leave the factory "with illness." Some factories and mines neglect the education of workers, and therefore some workers violate operating discipline, causing rework and scrap, and even serious accidents. Some enterprises have also not adequately supplemented the product inspection tools, gauges, and instruments that should be supplemented and could be supplemented, and the physical performance analysis of raw materials and products is insufficient. Technical supervision and laboratory organizations have not been established or improved; some enterprises also have technical difficulties that have not been vigorously organized for special research, conclusions have not been drawn, and they have not been resolved step by step. These are some of the reasons for poor or unstable product quality.
    In the production of industrial and mining enterprises, continuously improving product quality has extremely important economic and political significance. In his report to the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1934, Comrade Stalin said: "Improve the quality of products, stop producing incomplete goods, and ruthlessly punish all comrades who violate or evade the laws of the Soviet government regarding the production of excellent and complete products." Comrade Malenkov also pointed out in his speech at the meeting of the Nationalities Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on April 26, 1954: "Many enterprises do not comply with production technology standards, which is also a major shortcoming in industrial work. This exactly explains why the goods produced by many factories are of poor quality and do not meet the specifications and consumer needs. ... All departments must more quickly restore production order in enterprises that have violated production technology standards, and they must ensure that every enterprise only produces high-quality products." These have extremely valuable educational significance for us who are beginning to carry out large-scale economic construction.
    Making products meet certain quality standards is an indispensable condition for ensuring the normal development of national construction. Because if it is a consumer good, the quality of the product is directly related to the people's lives and health; if it is a means of production, the quality of the product directly affects the production and collaboration of other production sectors and affects national construction. Therefore, a product of poor quality is like an infectious disease, infecting others and bringing huge or even long-term damage to the national economy. This is an intolerable phenomenon.
    Improving product quality and eliminating incomplete products will bring huge economic benefits to all the people. Conversely, if the waste rate and substandard rate increase, the production cost of this enterprise will be very high, profits will be reduced, or it will simply be piled up in warehouses. This will undoubtedly hinder the accumulation of enterprises and the country, and hinder the progress of the entire national economy.
    State-owned factories and mines must continuously improve the quality of their products, continuously increase the variety, and produce large quantities of inexpensive and high-quality products to supply the needs of society, so as to strengthen the leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy; conversely, if any state-owned factory produces products of poor quality, it will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among the majority of consumers and users, and this may lead to these state-owned products being withdrawn from the market, thereby shrinking the socialist front and objectively helping the development of the capitalist economy. This situation is of course not conducive to the country's socialist construction.
    So, what effective measures should we take to improve product quality?
    First, we must continue to deeply publicize the general task of the transition period, raise the awareness of workers and staff, and start with summarizing the current implementation of the specified product quality indicators, and conduct specific ideological education for workers and staff, raising the task of improving product quality to all workers and staff, and repeatedly explaining to them the political and economic significance of improving product quality. We must make everyone realize that producing a large number of high-quality products is an extremely important and glorious task for workers and staff. The leading cadres of enterprises should combine the study of the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee, criticize those confused ideas, oppose complacency, and establish a comprehensive view of the plan to ensure that production is increased on the conditions of improving quality, reducing costs, ensuring safe production, and balancing supply and marketing, so as to comprehensively and balancedly complete the state plan. On the basis of the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of all workers and staff, various regions and departments should, under leadership, carry out regular labor competitions to improve product quality in enterprises, and promote the creativity of the masses. Enterprise administrative leaders and technicians should often go deep into the workshops to help solve technical problems, so that the labor enthusiasm and scientific knowledge of the masses are combined, and theory is combined with practice.
    Second, we must establish and improve the quality and related responsibility systems. From the technical supply of raw materials, technical operation to the ex-factory of products, there should be strict technical supervision and technical inspection systems. The important significance of the inspection of the technical supply of raw materials lies in ensuring the quality of products from a material perspective; the technical supervision of the process operation lies in being able to correct unqualified and incomplete parts in a timely manner; the ex-factory technical inspection system is an important means of strictly checking the quality specifications of products and preventing incomplete products from leaving the factory. Personnel who have contributed to quality improvement in enterprises should be commended and rewarded; piecework wages and excess production must also be carried out on the premise of ensuring that the products meet the specified standards, rather than giving "rewards" for producing bad goods. For those personnel and departments that seriously violate operating discipline or produce a large number of unqualified products, if the nature is serious, they should be given appropriate punishment according to the circumstances to educate cadres and the masses and improve their work. In addition, related to this, some larger enterprises or enterprises with conditions should immediately strengthen inspection institutions, supplement necessary inspection tools and equipment, strengthen experimental work and scientific research work, so as to technically ensure the improvement and upgrading of quality.
    Third, for some important products, the various industrial departments should generally actively formulate ministerial standards (and thereby transition to national standards), or appropriately adopt Soviet standards, to ensure the standardization of products, parts, and components. This is an extremely important measure to improve product quality, and the various industrial departments should pay close attention to it. At the same time, technical operating procedures should be formulated, revised, and reviewed based on the quality performance of the products and the experience of advanced workers, and the workers and staff should be fully and proficiently mastered these procedures and strictly abide by these procedures, and resolutely overcome those shortcomings in work caused by failure to comply with operating procedures and failure to familiarize themselves with new process procedures. For those departments that are tasked with producing new products, they must very conscientiously strengthen the design and trial production of products. This work is not only an important work to increase product variety, meet social needs, and give play to the potential capabilities of enterprises, but also a very important link in rapidly improving my country's industrial technology level and fundamentally improving product quality. All enterprise personnel must greet this task with high enthusiasm and unremitting fighting spirit.
    Fourth, strengthening the inspection and supervision of enterprise production is an effective method and step to overcome bureaucracy in leadership, promote enterprise progress, and ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan. Party and government organs in various places must continue to strengthen the inspection and supervision of local industrial enterprises, especially for those enterprises whose product quality is declining, and those products that are of poor quality and have already flowed into the market or have been distributed to user departments, they should promptly organize special inspections and draw conclusions to gain experience and lessons.
    When enterprise leaders arrange their work, they should be good at combining the central work of various periods with the regular work of the enterprise. This is necessary to establish and consolidate the normal production order of enterprises. Those "single-handed" practices are unsound practices and should be gradually improved. Our general slogan is: strive to improve product quality. Enterprise leaders should not relax this point when deploying any work. Only in this way can product quality be continuously improved and the tasks given by the state be successfully completed.

    为改善产品质量而斗争
    今年一月至四月份国营工矿企业的生产，从完成总产值计划的情况来看，一般是比较好的。中央六个工业部第一季实际完成总产值计划的百分之一○五，与去年同期比较为百分之一三二，与去年第四季（以工作日计算）比较为百分之一○二；四月份也完成了月计划的百分之一○三·九。这说明国营工业已开始改变了历来“年初松，年末紧”的老毛病，这是企业生产管理工作上的一个进步。
    但是在这期间，企业领导上还存在着若干缺点和问题，比较突出的就是部分国营厂矿和地方国营厂矿的产品质量标准还不稳定，废品和次品增多。部分企业部分产品的质量，比上月上季还有下降的趋势。例如有的水泥厂今年第一季的产品，其耐压强度就比过去下降；有的机器制造厂的铸件质量仍然时好时坏，某些产品的精密程度也没有达到要求的标准；有的纱厂的断头率也比以前上升；某些牌号的卷烟的质量也下降了。诸如此类的情况，在各地区、各工业部门都或多或少地相当普遍地存在着。这种现象，值得引起各级企业干部和经济工作人员的深切注意。
    造成产品质量不好或时好时坏的原因，是某些企业领导人员存在着不同程度不同形式的骄傲自满情绪。他们安于现状，满足于已有的成绩而停滞不前。这些同志似乎觉得目前那些销路既然没有问题的产品，其质量也“没有问题”了；或者认为产品质量已经有了很大改善，再进一步的改善已不太可能了；或者对本单位出产的产品质量，表现了盲目自信；有的则把产品质量不好的原因统统归结到外部条件；或者认为造成产品质量不好的一些技术问题是根本没有办法解决的。因为存在这些片面思想，就妨碍了主观上对改善产品质量的努力。
    部分厂矿部分产品质量不好是和这些单位的工作人员单纯追求产品数量，忽视产品质量的片面任务观点相关联的。这些同志只顾追求产品数量（当然保证完成计划是应该的），而忽视了其他计划指标和要求，把提高产量和改进产品质量对立起来，没有考虑到一个质量低劣的产品的经济效果和政治影响，没有采取有效措施保证全面地完成国家计划。这就不能不降低了各该企业的工作总成绩。因为单纯追求数量，生产不合格的产品，就会给国家造成重大的损害。
    产品质量不好，也由于某些企业的质量管理工作还不健全。有些厂矿缺乏一定的产品质量标准和技术操作规程；或者虽然有产品质量标准和技术操作规程，但也不完全适合新的情况，应该加以及时补充修正而未补充修正；或者有了产品质量标准和操作规程却未很好贯彻；也有的厂矿缺乏健全的质量责任制，当发现某一种零件、部件或产品质量不好的时候找不到专人负责。特别是由于缺乏严格的原材料的技术检验、工艺过程中的技术监督和产品出厂的检验制度，竟至使那些有毛病的产品“带病”出厂。有的厂矿忽视对工人的教育，因而也发生某些工人违反操作纪律，造成返工报废，甚至造成严重事故。也有的企业对应该补充和可能补充的产品检验工具、量具、仪器等没有得到应有的补充，对原材料和产品的物理性能分析不够，技术监督和化验机构没有建立或健全起来；有的企业存在着一些技术上的困难问题也没有大力组织专门研究，作出结论，有步骤地加以解决。这些，都是造成产品质量不好或不稳定的一些原因。
    在工矿企业生产中，不断改进产品质量具有极其重大的经济和政治的意义。一九三四年斯大林同志在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上所作的报告中说：“要改良产品质量，停止出产不完备的物品，不顾情面地惩办一切违反或回避苏维埃政权关于出产优良和完备产品的法律的那些同志”。马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃民族院一九五四年四月二十六日会议上的演说中也指出：“许多企业不遵守生产技术标准也是工业工作中的一个大缺点。这恰恰可以说明，为什么许多工厂生产的货物质量不好，不符合规格和消费者的需要。……各部必须更迅速地恢复违反了生产技术标准的企业的生产秩序，它们必须保证每一个企业只生产质量高的产品。”这些对于正在开始进行大规模经济建设的我们，具有极其宝贵的教育意义。
    使产品符合一定的质量标准，是保证国家建设正常发展的必不可缺少的条件。因为如果是消费资料，产品质量的好坏直接关系到人民的生活和健康；如果是生产资料，产品质量的好坏则直接影响到其他生产部门的生产和协作，影响到国家建设。因而一个质量低劣的产品就好像害流行症似的传染给别人，给国民经济带来巨大的甚至是长期的损害，这是不能容忍的现象。
    改进产品质量，消灭不完备的产品，会对全体人民带来巨大的经济利益。相反的，如果废品率、次品率增大，这个企业的产品不是生产成本很高，利润减少，就是干脆积压在库房里。这无疑会妨碍企业和国家的积累，妨碍整个国民经济的进展。
    国营厂矿必须不断改善自己产品的品质，不断地增加品种，大量生产价廉物美的产品供应社会需要，才能加强国营经济在国民经济中的领导作用；相反的，任何一个国营工厂如果生产质量低劣的产品，它势必引起广大消费者和使用部门的不满，并由此可能使这些国营产品退出市场，从而缩小了社会主义的阵地，客观上帮助了资本主义经济的发展。这种情况，当然是不利于国家的社会主义建设的。
    那么，我们应该采取那些有效的措施来改进产品的质量呢？
    第一、必须继续深入地宣传过渡时期的总任务，提高职工们的觉悟，并从总结当前执行规定的产品质量指标入手，向职工进行具体的思想教育，把为改进产品质量的任务提到全体职工面前，向他们反复说明改进产品质量的政治、经济意义。要使大家认识：生产大量质量优良的产品，是职工们极其重大的光荣任务。企业的领导干部，应结合学习中共四中全会文件，批判那些糊涂观念，反对骄傲自满情绪，树立计划的全面观点，以保证在提高质量、降低成本、安全生产、供销平衡等条件下来提高产量，全面地均衡地完成国家计划。在全体职工政治觉悟不断提高的基础上，各地区各部门应该有领导地开展企业的经常性的改善产品质量的劳动竞赛，发扬群众的创造才能。企业行政领导人员和技术人员应经常深入车间，帮助解决技术问题，使群众的劳动热忱和科学知识相结合，理论和实践相结合。
    第二、必须建立和健全质量及其有关的责任制，从原材料的技术供应、技术操作到产品出厂，都应有严格的技术监督和技术检查制度。原材料技术供应的检验的重要意义，就在于从物质上来保证产品的质量；工艺操作过程的技术监督就在于能够及时纠正不合格和不完备的零件部分；出厂技术检验制度则是严格检查产品的质量规格，防止不完备的产品出厂的重要手段。企业中对质量改善有贡献的人员应该受到表扬和奖励；计件工资和超额生产也必须在保证产品合乎规定标准的前提下进行，而不是生产了坏货色也给予“奖励”。对那些严重违犯操作纪律，或大批出产不合格的产品的人员和部门，如果性质严重，应该分别情况给予应得的处分，以教育干部和群众，改进工作。此外，与此相关的是某些较大的企业或有条件的企业，应即加强检验机构，补充必要的检验工具和设备，加强实验工作和科学研究工作，以便从技术上保证质量的改进和提高。
    第三、各工业部门对某些重要产品，一般的应积极地制定部颁标准（并由此过渡到国家标准），或适当地采用苏联标准，以保证产品、零件、部件的标准化。这是提高产品质量的一项极其重要的措施，各工业部门应给予深切的注意。与此同时，应根据产品的质量性能和先进工作者的经验，制定、修正、审订技术操作规程，并使职工群众充分地熟练地掌握这些规程和严格地遵守这些规程，坚决克服那些由于不遵守操作规程、不熟悉新的工艺程序所产生的工作缺点。对于那些负有生产新产品任务的部门，必须十分认真地加强产品的设计和试制工作。这项工作不仅是增加产品品种、满足社会需要、发挥企业潜在能力的一项重要工作，而且是迅速地提高我国的工业技术水平，从根本上改进产品质量的一个极重要的环节。全体企业人员必须用高度热情和奋斗不懈的精神来迎接这项任务。
    第四、加强对企业生产的检查督促，是克服领导上的官僚主义，推动企业前进，保证全面地完成国家计划的一个有效的方法和步骤。各地党政机关必须继续加强对当地工业企业的检查和督促，特别对于那些产品质量有下降趋势的企业，以及生产那些质量低劣并业已流入市场或分配到使用部门的产品，应及时地组织专门的检查，做出结论，以取得经验教训。
    在企业领导干部安排自己工作的时候，应该善于把各个时期的中心工作和企业的经常工作完满地结合起来。这是建立和巩固企业的正常生产秩序所必需的。那些“单打一”的作法是一种不健全的作法，应该逐步加以改进。我们的普遍口号是：努力为改善产品质量而斗争。企业的领导干部布置任何工作，都不应放松这一点。只有这样，才能使产品质量不断提高，胜利地完成国家所给予的任务。
