    Conscientiously Perform Unloading Work
    I
    A letter from the Beijing Branch of the Beijing Railway Administration's Loading, Unloading, and Supply Company: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on April 8th published a letter from reader Zhang Weixiang, reflecting damage to drilling tools shipped to Shuangqiao Station in late December due to careless unloading. After our investigation, the facts cited in this criticism are entirely accurate. Due to insufficient inspection before unloading, the cargo weigher failed to fulfill their supervisory responsibility, and the loading and unloading workers violated safe operating procedures during unloading, resulting in a loss of state property. We dispatched cadres to Shuangqiao Station on April 9th to handle this incident, educated the loading and unloading workers about the accident, and improved the method of carrying and unloading steel pipes (lowering heavy ones with ropes). At the same time, we instructed the branch director and team leader to improve their working methods and strengthen ideological education for the workers to ensure improved quality of loading and unloading work and prevent the recurrence of damage accidents.

    A letter from the Shijiazhuang Transportation Branch Loading, Unloading, and Supply Company of the Tianjin Railway Administration: The criticism from a reader published in the "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on April 8th regarding the damage to wooden beams caused by workers at our Linmingguan Station Loading and Unloading Branch during unloading is correct. After our investigation, the main reason for this situation is that workers have a tendency to simply seek speed in their work, neglecting safe operating procedures. We humbly accept the lessons of this incident and are determined to strengthen safety education and education on cherishing materials for workers in the future, and do a good job in line inspection, promptly correcting violations of operating procedures. The clerk acting as director of the branch and the stationmaster have also made written self-criticisms about this incident, and all workers have guaranteed that they will use safety ropes for unloading in the future to prevent the recurrence of accidents.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    认真做好卸车工作
    一
    北京铁路管理局北京分局装卸供应社来信：四月八日“读者来信摘要”栏发表了读者张维相的来信，反映去年十二月下旬运到双桥站的钻探工具因卸车不小心而破损的情况。经我们检查，这个批评所举的事实完全属实。由于卸车前检查不够，货物司磅员未尽到监卸责任，装卸工人卸车时违反了安全作业办法，以致使国家资财受到损失。我们已在四月九日派干部到双桥站处理这个事件，针对事故情况对装卸工人进行教育，并改善卸钢管的扛卸办法（重大的用绳溜下）；同时责成分社主任和班长改进工作方法，加强对工人的思想教育，以保证提高装卸工作的质量，防止毁损事故继续发生。

    天津铁路管理局石家庄运输分局装卸供应社来信：四月八日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者对我社临洺关车站装卸分社工人卸车时损毁元木的批评是正确的。经我们检查，发生这种情况的主要原因是工人们在工作中有单纯求快而忽视安全作业细则的偏向。我们虚心接受这件事故的教训，今后决心加强对工人的安全教育和爱护物资的教育，并做好线路监察工作，及时纠正违章作业的现象。该分社代行主任职务的事务员和站长对这个事件也都作了书面检讨，全体工人也都保证今后卸车一定要用保险绳，防止事故的再次发生。
