Working People Have the Right to Education
—A Record of a Constitution Draft Symposium at Renmin University of China
By Our Correspondent Bai Sheng

    The day after the draft constitution was published, a symposium was held at Renmin University of China, attended by renowned industrial labor models, combat heroes, and outstanding cadres from ethnic minorities studying in the preparatory course and the affiliated Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School. Everyone present expressed their inner joy with enthusiastic words.
    Li Fenglian, a national industrial labor model, said: "I am the daughter of a hired farmhand, and I was sold to a landlord's family as a child bride. I worked day and night for the landlord, and was often beaten and scolded. Even now, I still have scars all over my body. If it weren't for the Communist Party, how could I have this today! I can study at Renmin University, something I never would have imagined in the past! Now, the draft constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to education. How happy we are!"
    Chen Shulan was originally a young female worker at the Shashi Yarn Factory in Chongqing. After her production team studied and promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, they improved the fine yarn doffing work method and gloriously created a new national record for doffing. Today, she seemed very excited when she spoke. She said:
    "In the past, workers were slaves. When they were crushed to death by machines, they were dragged out like dead dogs. Today, the draft constitution guarantees the lives of workers, which makes me deeply feel the concern of the state for us. I must intensify my studies and prepare myself to build a beautiful and happy motherland."
    Xu Aihua is a spinning worker from Shanghai. She said excitedly: "Hearing the news of the publication of the draft constitution was truly exhilarating. It stipulates that citizens have the right to education. I started working in a factory at the age of twelve. At that time, I really envied those who could go to school. I asked the capitalists to let me work and study at the same time, but the answer I got was: you are only destined to work, you are not worthy of going to school. Today, I can also go to university!"
    Hang Peilan, a national textile industry labor model, said emotionally: "Today, the working class is the master of the country, and labor has become a glorious right for everyone. I worked in a factory from a young age and suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation. In the old society, we workers were not treated as human beings, and our lives were not guaranteed. But today, an ordinary textile worker like me has become a labor model, and the country and the people have given me honor. The draft constitution also stipulates our due rights in articles. In the future, I must overcome all kinds of difficulties in my studies and complete my study tasks well."
    Liu Keqin, a Southwest China industrial labor model, compared the Kuomintang's pseudo-constitution with today's draft constitution. He said:
    "Today, our working people are truly masters of the country and have the right to discuss the fundamental law of the country. In the era of Kuomintang reactionary rule, we workers did not have this right."
    Maimaitiniyazi (Uyghur), who was awarded the title of "People's Hero," is an outstanding ethnic minority trade worker. He excitedly expressed his heartfelt feelings. He said: "The draft constitution embodies the country's concern for the rights of our ethnic minorities and stipulates it in legal terms. This has never happened in history before. During the Kuomintang rule, ethnic minorities were oppressed everywhere and lived an extremely painful life. After liberation, we gained a happy life. The state not only cares about our economic life but also helps us ethnic minorities develop cultural and educational undertakings and cultivates our own cadres for us ethnic minorities. I was sent to Renmin University of China to study under the care of the Party. Today, so many of our ethnic minority youth can happily study all over the country, which is so exciting! In the future, we will work with all fraternal ethnic groups to build a socialist society."
    The talks of Chun Jiacai and Zhou Tiancai, who participated in the 25,000-li Long March, were even more profound and touching. They joined the revolutionary ranks at a very young age and went through difficult years. Chun Jiacai said: The draft constitution was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs, and we should cherish it. Today, I deeply feel the importance of my responsibility. I will work harder to study and improve my cultural level. Zhou Tiancai won the title of "Artillery Search Hero" in the People's Liberation War. He said that the draft constitution is a great symbol of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Every article in it is condensed with the blood of the martyrs. We should cherish it.
    Wang Youshan said: "I used to work in the judiciary, so I have a deeper understanding of the draft constitution. It is a powerful guarantee for our people to build socialism."
    As the symposium was about to end, Ma Zhanzhong, deputy director of the preparatory course at Renmin University of China, expressed his opinion. He kindly encouraged everyone to study the draft constitution carefully and publicize it to the people. (Attached picture)

    劳动人民有了受教育的权利
    ——记中国人民大学的一个宪法草案座谈会
    本报记者　柏生
    宪法草案公布的第二天，在中国人民大学预科和附设工农速成中学学习的著名工业劳动模范、战斗英雄、少数民族的优秀干部，开了一个宪法草案座谈会。到会的每一个人，都用热情的话语表达了自己内心的喜悦。
    全国工业劳动模范李凤莲说：“我是雇农的女儿，从小被卖到地主家做童养媳，黑夜白日给地主干活，经常挨打受骂。直到现在我浑身都还留着伤痕呢，要不是共产党，我那能有今天！我能上人民大学学习，过去是怎么也不会想到的啊！现在，宪法草案规定了公民有受教育的权利，我们是多么幸福啊！”
    陈树兰原是重庆市沙市纱厂的青年女工，她的生产小组在学习和推广了郝建秀工作法以后，改进了细纱落纱工作法，并光荣地创造了全国落纱的新纪录。今天，她讲话的时候显得那样激动。她说：
  “过去工人是奴隶，被机器压死时，像死狗似地被拖出去。今天，宪法草案保障了工人的生活，这使我深刻地体会到国家对我们的关怀。我一定要加紧学习，为建设美好幸福的祖国而准备力量。”
    徐爱华是上海的纺纱女工。她兴奋地说：“听到宪法草案公布的消息，真是高兴极啦。它规定了公民有受教育的权利。我十二岁就进了工厂做工。那时，我看到别人能上学，真是羡慕。我向资本家要求一边做工，一边读书，可是得到的回答是：你只有做工的命，不配上学。今天，我也能上大学了！”
    全国纺织工业劳动模范杭佩兰激动地说：“今天工人阶级当家作了主，劳动成为每个人光荣的权利。我从小就在工厂里做工，受尽压迫和剥削。在旧社会里我们工人不被当人看，生活也没有保障。但是今天，像我这样一个普通的纺织女工居然成了劳动模范，国家人民还给了我荣誉。宪法草案中又把我们应享的权利用条文规定了下来。今后，我一定要在学习中战胜各种困难，很好地完成自己的学习任务。”
    西南区工业劳动模范刘克勤，把国民党的伪宪法和今天我们的宪法草案作了一个比较，他说：
  “今天，咱们劳动人民真正当家作了主，有权讨论国家的大法。在国民党反动统治时代，我们工人那有这个权利。”
    曾获得“人民功臣”称号的买卖提尼雅孜（维吾尔族），是一个优秀的少数民族贸易工作干部，他兴奋地道出了心里话。他说：“宪法草案体现了国家对我们少数民族人民权利的关怀，并用法律条文把它规定下来，这是历史上从来也没有过的事情。国民党统治时期，少数民族人民处处受到压迫，过着极端痛苦的生活。解放以后，我们才获得了幸福的生活。国家不但关怀我们的经济生活，还帮助我们少数民族发展文化教育事业，为我们少数民族培养自己的干部。我就是在党的关怀下送到中国人民大学来学习的。今天我们许多少数民族的青年能够幸福地在祖国各地学习，这是多么令人兴奋的事情啊！今后，我们将和各兄弟民族一起为建设社会主义社会而努力。”
    参加过二万五千里长征的淳家彩、周天才的谈话，更是深刻感人。他们都在年纪很小时就参加了革命队伍，度过了艰难的岁月。淳家彩说：宪法草案是用革命先烈们的鲜血写成的，我们应该爱护它。今天我深感到自己责任的重大。我要更努力学习，提高自己的文化水平。周天才在人民解放战争中曾获得了“搜炮英雄”的称号。他说宪法草案是中国人民革命胜利的伟大标志。它的每一条文里都凝结着烈士们的鲜血。我们应该珍视它。
    王有山说：“我过去曾经作过司法工作，因此我对宪法草案有更深刻的体会。它是我国人民建设社会主义的有力保证。”
    座谈会快要结束的时候，中国人民大学预科副主任马占忠发表了意见，他亲切地鼓励大家好好学习宪法草案，并向人民群众进行宣传。（附图片）
