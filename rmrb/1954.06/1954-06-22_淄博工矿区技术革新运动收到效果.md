    The technical innovation movement in the Zibo industrial and mining area has yielded results. A large number of advanced production units and model figures have emerged. According to statistics from eight state-owned coal mines in the area, there are already fourteen advanced shifts and teams, one hundred and sixty-two advanced groups, and one hundred and seven advanced workers. In the state-owned Boshan Electric Motor Factory, labor models and advanced producers account for 20% of the total number of employees. These advanced figures are driving the broad masses of workers and staff throughout the area to create new achievements on the road of technical innovation.
    Under the influence of the technical innovation movement in Anshan Iron and Steel Works, the workers and staff of various factories and mines in the Zibo industrial and mining area, starting from the first quarter of this year, have launched a technical innovation movement throughout the area, focusing on discussing the national plan and solving key current production issues. According to incomplete statistics from the first quarter, workers and staff throughout the area proposed a total of 2,250 rationalization proposals, including improvements to tools, equipment, and operating methods. Among them, 976 were adopted and implemented, which played a significant role in completing or overfulfilling the national plan. For example, the biggest problem in the state-owned Boshan Electric Motor Factory was the shortage of lathe operators, with a total shortage of more than 40,000 work hours throughout the year. After the workers came up with ways to improve tools and operating methods, the shortage of lathe operators was basically solved. Another example is the "May Fourth" coal mining team of the state-owned Hongshan Coal Mine, which proposed thirteen solutions to overcome the natural obstacles and increase daily coal production from 270 tons to 385 tons in response to the production difficulties of having coal seams with rock bursts and encountering faults in the lower part. The Pharmaceutical Department of the Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory improved the method of low-temperature filling of liquid medicine and the continuous device for filtering liquid medicine, which greatly reduced the rejection rate. The rejection rate of calcium chloride has been reduced from 10% to about 5%. The Shandong Pesticide Factory established a working group including the factory director, engineers, technicians, and managers to go deep into the workshops and combine with the workers, and actively launched a mass technical innovation movement throughout the factory. The nitration department of this factory improved the operating method, increasing production efficiency by 2.37 times; the chlorination department shortened the chlorination time, increasing chlorination efficiency by 1.06 times. By solving the above key production problems, it will be possible to increase production and save 12.2 billion yuan for the country this year.
    In the technical innovation movement, the leadership of most factories and mines attached great importance to and supported the technical innovation of the workers and staff, and paid attention to strengthening the ideological education and organizational leadership of the workers and staff. The Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory changed the original rationalization proposal committee to a production innovation committee, and each workshop established a technical innovation group to promptly and conscientiously handle the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers and staff, thus greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers and staff for technical innovation. The Boshan Electric Motor Factory also held an exhibition to showcase the major achievements of technical innovation in the factory with objects and pictures, and made the six major production key problems that currently exist into pictures to mobilize the workers to actively think of solutions, so that the technical innovation movement has a clear direction of effort.

    淄博工矿区技术革新运动收到效果
    山东淄博工矿区在技术革新运动中已涌现出大批先进生产单位和模范人物。据全区八个国营煤矿的统计，已出现了十四个先进的班、队和一百六十二个先进小组，以及一百零七个先进工人。国营博山电机厂涌现出的劳动模范和先进生产者就占全厂职工总人数的百分之二十。这些先进人物，正带动着全区广大职工在技术革新的道路上创造新的成就。
    淄博工矿区各厂矿职工，在鞍钢技术革新运动的影响下，从今年第一季度开始，就针对讨论国家计划和解决当前生产关键等问题，在全区内展开了技术革新运动。据第一季度不完全统计，全区职工共提出合理化建议两千二百五十件，包括改进工具、改进设备和改进操作方法等方面，其中被采纳执行的有九百七十六件，对完成或超额完成国家计划起了显著作用。如国营博山电机厂最大的问题是车工不足，全年共缺四万多个工时，经工人想办法改进工具和操作方法以后，车工不足的问题基本上得到解决。又如国营洪山煤矿“五四”采煤队，针对采煤面有喷出岩及下部遇到断层的生产困难，提出了十三条解决办法，克服了自然障碍，使产煤每日由二百七十吨提高到三百八十五吨。新华制药厂针药部改进了药液低温充填和药液过滤连续装置的办法，废品率大大降低，其中氯化钙废品已由百分之十降低到百分之五左右。山东农药厂成立了包括厂长、工程师、技术员和管理人员的工作组深入车间和工人结合，积极在全厂展开群众性的技术革新运动。这个厂硝化部改进了操作方法，提高生产效率二点三七倍；氯化部缩短了氯化时间，使氯化效率提高了一点零六倍。由于解决了以上生产关键，今年就能为国家增产节约一百二十二亿元。
    在技术革新运动中，多数厂矿领导方面都很重视和支持职工群众的技术革新，并注意加强职工的思想教育和组织领导。新华制药厂将原来的合理化建议委员会改为生产革新委员会，各车间建立了技术革新小组，及时认真处理职工提出的合理化建议，因而大大鼓舞了职工技术革新的热情。博山电机厂还举办展览会，以实物和图片展出了全厂技术革新的重大成就，并将目前存在的六大生产关键问题制成图片，发动工人积极想法解决，使技术革新运动有了明确的努力方向。
