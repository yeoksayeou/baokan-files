    Yumen Oil Mine Implements Soviet Expert Advice
    Prepares for Waterflooding on Oilfield Periphery

    Yumen Oil Mine is implementing Soviet expert advice and executing a new oilfield development plan, and is now preparing for waterflooding on the periphery of the oilfield.

    Waterflooding on the periphery is the most important part of the new oilfield development plan, and also one of the key tasks of the petroleum industry this year. Once waterflooding takes effect, the crude oil production of a certain oil layer in the Laojunmiao Oilfield can be increased by at least one to two times. At the same time, waterflooding on the periphery can maintain the oil well's production pressure above the oilfield's saturation pressure, so the most economical and simplest method of self-flowing oil extraction can be maintained for a long time. If waterflooding on the periphery is not carried out, the oilfield pressure will gradually decrease, causing a sharp decline in oil well production. After self-flowing stops, mechanical oil extraction must be used, which increases oil extraction costs and also increases technical difficulties.

    Last October, Soviet expert Academician A. Atrafeymk put forward principled suggestions on the development of the Laojunmiao Oilfield. Then, under the direct guidance of Soviet experts, preparations were made for the design of the waterflooding scheme. In February of this year, this work was initially completed, and with the consent of the Petroleum Management Bureau, it was formally used as the basis for the design of the waterflooding project. Based on this preliminary plan, the design of the waterflooding project and the supplementary water supply project, as well as the preparation of various equipment and materials, were started. Now, various equipment and materials are being shipped in continuously, and the design of the waterflooding project and the water supply project have been largely completed, and a preliminary construction plan has also been compiled. According to the construction plan, at least one water injection well will be tested for water injection in August of this year. At present, the well locations of all water injection wells have been determined, and the first water injection well officially started drilling on May 24.

    In order to train specialized waterflooding personnel, a waterflooding training class will also be organized in June this year.

### 玉门油矿贯彻苏联专家建议  准备进行油田边缘注水工作

    玉门油矿贯彻苏联专家建议
    准备进行油田边缘注水工作
    玉门油矿贯彻苏联专家建议、执行新的油田开采方案，现在正准备进行油田边缘注水的工作。
    边缘注水工作是新的油田开采方案中最主要的一环，也是石油工业今年的重点工作之一。注水发生效果后，老君庙油田某一油层的原油产量至少能提高一倍到二倍。同时，边缘注水之后能保持油井产油压力在油田饱和压力之上，因此，最经济最简单的自喷采油方法能够维持长久。如果不进行边缘注水，油田压力将会陆续下降，使油井的产量锐减；停止自喷后，必须采用机械采油，使采油费用增加，技术上也增加了困难。
    去年十月，苏联专家阿·阿特拉费姆克院士就提出了关于老君庙油田开采的原则性建议，然后在苏联专家的直接指导下，进行了注水方案设计的各项准备工作。今年二月，初步完成了这一工作，经石油管理总局同意正式作为注水工程设计的基础，并依据这一初步方案着手进行注水工程和补充给水工程设计、以及各项器材设备的准备工作。现在，各项器材正源源运到，注水工程设计和给水工程设计大体上都已经完成，并且还编制了初步的施工计划。根据施工计划，今年八月里至少将有一口注水井进行注水试验。目前，各个注水井的井位都已经确定，同时第一口注水井也已于五月二十四日正式开钻。
    为了培养注水专门工作人员，今年六月里并将筹办一次注水训练班。
