Wheat Bumper Harvest

According to preliminary statistics, the national wheat planting area this year reached approximately 400 million mu. Currently, the harvesting of winter wheat, which accounts for over 85% of the total, is nearing completion. Due to the expansion of the planting area and the increase in yield per unit area, the achievement of wheat production increase is substantial. This is a major victory on the grain production front in our country this year.

The Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government have implemented a series of policies to develop agricultural production and have carried out a series of specific tasks to develop agricultural production. This is an important reason for this year's bumper wheat harvest.

The improvement of agricultural production technology has played a significant role in this year's bumper wheat harvest. Therefore, in the future, agricultural science and technology must be more closely integrated with farmers' production experience, and mass production technology improvement work should be further expanded to strive for continuous improvement in yield per unit area to meet the needs of national construction.

Farmers in wheat-producing areas across the country recognize the great significance of selling surplus grain to the state to support the country's socialist industrial construction, and are enthusiastically selling new wheat.

    小麦丰收
    今年全国小麦种植面积据初步统计约达四亿市亩。目前占总额百分之八十五以上的冬小麦收割已近完成，由于种植面积的扩大和单位面积产量的提高，小麦增产的成绩很大。这是今年我国粮食生产战线上的一大胜利。

    中国共产党和中央人民政府实行了一系列发展农业生产的政策，作了一系列发展农业生产的具体工作。这是今年小麦所以得到丰收的重要原因。

    农业生产技术的改进，对今年小麦丰收起着很大的作用。因此，今后必须把农业科学技术和农民生产经验更密切地结合起来，进一步展开群众性的生产技术改进工作，争取单位面积产量的不断提高，以适应国家建设的需要。
