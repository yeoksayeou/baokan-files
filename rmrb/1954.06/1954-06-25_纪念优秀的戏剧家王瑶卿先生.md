    In Memory of the Outstanding Dramatist Mr. Wang Yaoqing
    Ma Shaobo
    The death of the famous dramatist Mr. Wang Yaoqing is a major loss to the Chinese drama community.

    Mr. Yaoqing made creative contributions to the development of Peking Opera art and Peking Opera education. His spirit of daring to innovate in art and his attitude of tireless, serious dedication to art education left us with a deep impression that we will never forget.

    Mr. Yaoqing's prime was during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, Peking Opera art had gone through nearly a hundred years of vigorous creation, and its form had gradually become fixed. Except for a very few senior artists in the Peking Opera world who were determined to innovate in form, most adhered to the old ways. Taking female roles as an example, at that time, the divisions between Qingyi Dan, Comic Dan, Sword and Horse Dan, Assassination Dan, Boudoir Dan, and Martial Dan were very strict. Qingyi Dan was originally Zhengdan (principal female role), and was not allowed to play other Dan roles. Qingyi Dan mostly played chaste women and virtuous wives. In performance, it was strictly stipulated that the skirt should not move, and the teeth should not be exposed when smiling. The general demeanor was very restrained, "only allowed to hold the belly with both hands and sing foolishly" (Mr. Yaoqing's words), so there was no vivid expression or delicate movement at all. Each Dan role had its own performance requirements, and such strict division of labor severely limited the complete and vivid creation of characters and the expression of emotions. Mr. Yaoqing's predecessors and contemporaries, such as Mei Qiaoling, Yu Ziyun, Shi Xiaofu, Lu Sanbao, Li Zishan, and Chen Delin, had all made certain efforts to break this boundary; however, starting clearly from the characters, not being restricted by old rules in performance, and resolutely breaking through this restriction, started with Mr. Yaoqing and achieved significant results.

    He integrated the performance methods of Qingyi and Huadan according to different roles, and when necessary, also incorporated the techniques of Daomadan. In performance, he particularly emphasized "inner drama," and especially emphasized "plot," "reasoning," and "emotion." For example, the three plays "Sangyuan Hui" (Mulberry Garden Meeting), "Fenhe Bay," and "Wujia Slope" are roughly the same in terms of plot structure and artistic image; however, Mr. Yaoqing made strict distinctions between the three characters Luo Fu, Liu Yingchun, and Wang Baochuan. He said: "Don't think they are all about the same. 'Teasing the Wife' has a mother; 'Shooting the Goose' has a son; 'Running the Slope' is single. There's something to it. If you sing it all as one soup, is that still a play!" He was not only able to accurately grasp the circumstances and the truth of the characters' personalities and emotions specified in a play; but also good at using techniques to concisely and centrally portray characters and express life. With the changes and development of the plot, diverse movements and actions were formed, eye contact and facial expressions were strengthened during singing, and the singing voice was tactful and free, so that the voice and appearance complemented each other to express emotions. All of this is in line with the principles of realism. Many of the old plays he performed, such as "Sacrificing to the River," "Sacrificing to the Pagoda," "Leaving the Garden," "Teaching the Son," "The Women's Army," "Hujiazhuang," "The Blazing Flag," "Marriage on Horseback," "Mukezhai," and "Nengren Temple," "Female Escort," etc., have significant developments in the expression of the characters' personalities; especially the plays he performed with Tan Xinpei, such as "Sangyuan Jizi" (Mulberry Garden Sending Son), "Bao Lian Deng" (Lotus Lantern), "Killing the Fisherman," "The Woman Who Killed Her Son," "Fenhe Bay," "The Shepherd's Circle," "Ganzanguan," "Wujia Slope," and "Battle of Puguan," can be said to have reached the point where they were equally matched, each showing their strengths. Xiao Guiying in "Killing the Fisherman" and Thirteenth Sister in "Nengren Temple" began with Mr. Yaoqing with such prominent character portrayals. The plays he arranged in his early years, such as "The Mirror of Fortune and Longevity," "Hua Mulan," "Qipanshan," and "The Biography of Geng Niang," more systematically put his performance methods into practice. He often said: "I never pick roles. Whether there are many or few scenes, whether the play is light or heavy, I sing. I think the road is made by people walking, and the play is sung by people. Even a small play, as long as you are willing to put in the effort to understand it, you can still sing it well; if you only look for important roles to play, it will be ruined if you don't sing well." This is something that some actors who are unwilling to work hard to improve their art and only blindly care about their status should deeply think about. He advocated that "a dead play can be sung alive; a dead play can be brought to life." He took a serious and meticulous attitude towards many cold plays and unimportant roles, such as Mi Furen in "Changban Slope," Cheng Niangzi in "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans," and Wang Baochuan in "Three Slaps," and greatly enriched the art of performance from the aspects of gesture and expression. He had a broad mind and did not stick to one pattern. He was good at learning from and absorbing the strengths of others, and was unwilling to stick to the old ways and be complacent. He was most opposed to "factions" and sticking to the old ways, and often said that he was "North-South combined." He once said: "People ask me what school I am, and I say I am a miscellaneous school! A person who studies art should humbly learn from the strengths of others, and they will feel that the road is wider; if they drill into the dead end of a faction and imitate blindly, they will be useless for the rest of their lives!"

    In his early years, in addition to the creation of scripts and performing arts, he also boldly made some improvements in singing, clothing, and makeup. For example, Thirteenth Sister's abolishing foot-binding and wearing small boots was his innovation. His various reforms once caused ridicule and criticism from many people. We can fully imagine that in such a dark and corrupt society, even reforms in stage image and atmosphere could not be fundamentally achieved; however, even partial reforms were so difficult and arduous. Mr. Yaoqing once said: "In everything, there must be a rush. If you are afraid of getting burned, afraid of being scolded, you are guaranteed to achieve nothing." This can fully express his spirit of engaging in his career. This spirit was maintained until his later years. He assisted the China Peking Opera Troupe in rehearsing "Liuyin Ji" (The Story of Liuyin) and guided the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera's Opera School in rehearsing "The Legend of the White Snake" and many other plays. In the creation of singing and movements, he had breakthroughs beyond the old rules. The reason why he was able to do this was on the one hand because he earnestly inherited the excellent artistic traditions of his predecessors. He not only had a Kunqu opera foundation, but also worked hard to learn and practice Qingyi, Huadan, and Daomadan. He had a very deep and solid foundation himself, and also had a higher cultural accomplishment, moving from extensive knowledge to proficiency; on the other hand, it was because he had a creative and courageous spirit of innovation. This spirit has been influencing the Chinese opera world, and even today, it still has practical educational significance for opera reform work.

    Mr. Yaoqing had disciples in his early years. At the age of forty-six, because his voice lost its moisture, he ended his stage life and devoted himself to teaching opera art. In the past thirty years, he has taught hundreds of disciples.

    After the national liberation, Mr. Yaoqing, at the advanced age of nearly seventy, actively participated in the opera reform work under the leadership of the People's Government. In 1949, he served as a professor at the Chinese Academy of Traditional Opera's Opera School; in 1951, he served as the principal. He wholeheartedly led all the teachers and students of the school to create and accumulate certain experiences for the development of Chinese opera education. He usually cared very much about teaching work, and he himself never interrupted teaching, and his teaching methods were patient and strict. He not only taught his skills to the students without reservation; but also analyzed the characters for the students in exceptionally detailed and practical ways, and taught the students the skill of "coming to life and entering death" to transform themselves into characters. His teaching principles are: First, tailor the teaching to the individual and make the best use of their talents; Second, teach good plays and learn good plays; Third, learn without taking shortcuts, and teach without hiding secrets; Fourth, have inner drama, and become whoever you play; Fifth, pay attention to the waist, legs, and feet in movements, pay attention to the water sleeves in actions, and pay attention to the eyes in expressions. The so-called "hands, eyes, body, steps, methods," "correct pronunciation and round cavity," and comprehensive training; Sixth, oppose mechanical imitation and flaunting factions.

    Mr. Yaoqing had profound insights in art and also had a high degree of enthusiasm in politics. At the conference where he took office as the principal of the Opera School three years ago, he said excitedly: "I am already seventy-one years old. Seeing the liberation of artists in New China, and the country looks up to me, what else can I say? I can only vow to dedicate myself to the people and serve the people wholeheartedly! Students, you must study hard. Everything I have learned and known, I will give to you without reservation!" Facts have proved that Mr. Yaoqing fully carried out his oath. In the five years that I spent with him, every time I saw him, I was deeply moved by his loyal and diligent work spirit. When the movement to resist America and aid Korea began, I was also deeply moved by the internationalism and patriotism he showed when he took the lead in organizing veteran artists in the opera world to hold donation performances. In 1952, he pinned the gold medal of honor awarded to him by the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government after the first National Opera Observation and Performance Conference on his chest, and I could feel the happiness and comfort that this respectable and beloved old man had received. In August 1953, he suddenly suffered from cerebral hemorrhage. When I went to see him, he could no longer speak, but he was very clear-headed. After that, he stayed in the hospital for eight months. When I went to see him, he almost always conveyed his emotions in silent language. He was saying: "Look, I can't teach opera anymore, how can I live up to Chairman Mao! Isn't this going to make people anxious to death!"

    Mr. Yaoqing was not only an outstanding performing artist in China, but also had extremely high talents in opera directing, composing, and teaching. The creative spirit, innovative spirit, and responsible spirit in cultivating talents that he showed in his sixty years have set a brilliant example in the Chinese drama community.

    Mr. Yaoqing, your art has been correctly inherited and developed in the motherland. For us, is there anything more lasting than combining one's own efforts with the happiness of the people, and flowing endlessly with the happy life of the people!

    纪念优秀的戏剧家王瑶卿先生
    马少波
    著名戏剧家王瑶卿先生的逝世，在中国戏剧界是一个重大的损失。
    瑶卿先生对于京剧艺术的发展和京剧教育工作，是有创造性的贡献的。他在艺术上勇于革新的精神和在艺术教育上诲人不倦严肃认真的态度，给了我们深刻的印象，使我们永远不能忘怀。
    瑶卿先生的盛年，是正当清代光绪年间，那时京剧艺术经过了将近百年蓬勃的创成阶段之后，在形式上已经逐渐趋于定型。京剧界除极少数前辈艺人在形式上锐意革新以外，多半是墨守成规。以旦角来说，那时候，青衣旦、玩笑旦、刀马旦、刺杀旦、闺门旦、武旦各行分界是很严的。青衣旦原为正旦，依例不许兼演其他旦角。青衣旦扮演的大多是贞女节妇，在表演上严格规定行不动裙，笑不露齿。一般的举止十分拘谨，“只许双手捧着肚子傻唱”（瑶卿先生语），因而根本谈不上有什么生动的表情和细腻的动作。各旦行在表演要求上各有所偏，这样严格的分工，对于完整地生动地创造人物，表达感情，是有严重限制的。瑶卿先生的前辈艺人、同辈艺人如梅巧玲、余紫云、时小福、路三宝、李紫珊、陈德霖等为了打破这种界限，都曾经作了一定程度的努力；但是明确地从人物出发，在表演上不受旧规限制，坚决突破这种限制，是从瑶卿先生开始，而且有了显著成效的。
    他根据不同角色把青衣和花旦的表演方式融合起来，而且必要时兼收刀马旦的技巧。他在表演上特别讲究“心戏”，特别注重“戏文”、“戏理”、“戏情”。例如“桑园会”、“汾河湾”、“武家坡”这三出戏，在剧情结构、艺术形象上是大体相同的；但是瑶卿先生对于罗敷、柳迎春、王宝钏这三个剧中人是有严格区别的。他说：“你别以为都差不多，‘戏妻’有个母亲；‘打雁’多个儿子；‘跑坡’才是单身，这里面就有文章了。要唱成一道汤，那还算是戏吗！”他不但能够准确地掌握一出戏中所规定的情境和人物的性格、感情的真实；而且善于运用技巧，精炼地集中地刻划人物，表现生活。随着剧情的变化和发展，形成身段动作的多样化，歌唱时加强眼神和面部表情，并使唱腔婉转自如，来使声容互为配合地表现感情。这一切，是符合现实主义的原则的。他演的许多老戏如“祭江”、“祭塔”、“落园”、“教子”、“娘子军”、“扈家庄”、“烈火旗”、“马上缘”、“穆柯寨”、“能仁寺”、“女起解”等，在人物的性格表现上都有显著的发展；尤其是和谭鑫培合演的戏，如“桑园寄子”、“宝莲灯”、“打渔杀家”、“女斩子”、“汾河湾”、“牧羊圈”、“赶三关”、“武家坡”、“战蒲关”等戏，与谭老先生可以说是达到了工力悉敌，各展所长的地步。“打渔杀家”里的萧桂英、“能仁寺”里的十三妹，性格表演之特别突出，是从瑶卿先生开始的。他早年编排的“福寿镜”、“花木兰”、“棋盘山”、“庚娘传”等戏，更有计划地实践了他的表演方法。他常说：“我素来不拣角色。无论戏多戏少，戏轻戏重，我都唱。我认为路是人走出来的，戏是人唱出来的。哪怕是一出小戏，只要肯用功夫去体会，一样可以唱出采声来；如果专找重要角色扮演，唱不好也是砸。”这对于现在有些不肯努力提高艺术、只是盲目地计较地位的演员，是多么值得深思。他主张“死戏可以活唱；死戏可以唱活”。他对于不少的冷戏和不重要的角色，如他扮演的“长板坡”中的麋夫人、“搜孤救孤”中的程娘子、“三击掌”中的王宝钏等，不但在表演态度上严肃认真，一丝不苟；而且从身段表情上大大丰富了表演艺术。他胸襟宽博，不拘一格，他善于学习和吸收别人的专长，不肯抱残守阙，故步自封。他最反对“派别”和墨守成规，常说自己是“南北合”。他曾这样说过：“人家问我是什么派，我说我是杂派！一个学艺的人，应该虚心学习别人的长处，就会觉着路宽了；若是钻进派别的牛角尖，依样画葫芦，那是一辈子没出息！”
    他在早年除了剧本和表演艺术的创造之外，在唱腔、服装、扮相各方面也都大胆地进行了若干改进。例如“十三妹”的废蹻，改着小蛮靴，就是他的创举。他的种种改革，当时是曾经引起了许多人的讥笑和非难的。我们完全可以设想到，在那样黑暗腐败的社会里，就是舞台形象和风气的改革，也绝不可能作到根本的改革；但是，即便是枝节的改革，也是多么艰难困苦啊。瑶卿先生曾这样说过：“凡事总得有个冲劲，怕烧着烫着，怕挨骂，保管一事无成。”这可以充分表现他从事事业的精神。这种精神一直保持到他的晚年，他协助中国京剧团排演了“柳荫记”、指导中国戏曲研究院戏曲学校排演了“白蛇传”等许多戏，在创造唱腔、身段的工作上，都有着突破旧规的成就。他所以能够这样，一方面是由于认真地继承前辈的优良艺术传统，他不但有昆曲底子，而且无论青衣、花旦、刀马旦，都曾苦学勤练过，自己有很深厚坚实的根基，又有较高的文化修养，由博通而趋于精湛；另方面是由于他富有创造和勇于革新的精神。这种精神，在中国戏曲界一直发生着影响，直到今天，对于戏曲改革工作，还有它的现实的教育意义。
    瑶卿先生早年就收过弟子。四十六岁那年，因为嗓音失润，结束了自己的舞台生活，就全力以赴地传授剧艺。近三十年来，所授弟子，达数百人。
    全国解放以后，瑶卿先生以将近七十岁的高龄，积极参加在人民政府领导下的戏曲改革工作。一九四九年即在中国戏曲研究院戏曲学校任教授；一九五一年任校长。他全心全意地领导着全校师生，为中国戏曲教育事业的发展，创造和积累了一定的经验。他平素十分关心教学工作，而且自己也从来没有间断过教学，教学方法耐心而又严格。他不但毫无保留地把自己的技艺教授给学生；而且异常详尽切实地为学生分析人物，教给学生“出死入生”化身为角色的功夫。他在教学上的主张：第一、量体裁衣，人尽其才；第二、要教好戏，要学好戏；第三、学不取巧，教不藏私；第四、要有心戏，演谁是谁；第五、身段注重腰腿脚步，动作注重水袖，表情注重眼神。所谓“手、眼、身、步、法”、“字正腔圆”、全面训练；第六、反对机械摹仿，标榜派别。
    瑶卿先生在艺术上是有深刻见解的，在政治上也是有高度热情的。在三年前他就任戏曲学校校长的大会上，他激动地说：“我已经是七十一岁的人了，看到了新中国的艺人翻身，国家瞧得起我，我还有什么说的呢，我只有发誓献身于人民，全心全意地为人民服务！同学们，你们要好好地学习。凡是我所学所会的，将毫无保留地倾囊以赠！”事实证明，瑶卿先生完全执行了他的誓言。在他和我相处五年的日子里，每次见到他，他那种忠诚勤劳的工作精神，深深感动着我。当抗美援朝运动开始的时候，他带头组织戏曲界老艺人举行捐献义演时所表现的国际主义、爱国主义热情，也深深地感动过我。一九五二年他在胸前挂上了中央文化部在第一届全国戏曲观摩演出大会后颁发给他的金质荣誉奖章，我体会得到这位可敬爱的老人得到的幸福和安慰。一九五三年八月他突然患了脑溢血症，我去看他的时候，他已经不能说话了，但是神志很清醒；此后，他在医院住了八个月，我去看他，他几乎每次都用无声的语言传达感情。他是说：“你看我不能教戏了，怎么对得起毛主席！不是要把人活活地急死吗！”
    瑶卿先生不但是中国优秀的表演艺术家，而且在戏曲的编导、作曲、教学工作上，都有极高的才能，他在六十年中所表现的创造精神、革新精神、培养人才的负责精神，在中国戏剧界树立了光辉的榜样。
    瑶卿先生，你的艺术在祖国已经得到正确的继承和发展了。生命对于我们，还有比把自己的心血和人民的幸福结合在一起，而且跟着人民的幸福生活长流不息更久远的么！
