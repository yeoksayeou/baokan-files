    Agricultural Technology Extension Stations in Various Regions
    Help Farmers Improve Spring Field Operations
    In order to help farmers improve agricultural technology and promote the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, the state has established a number of agricultural technology extension stations in various regions. By the end of last year, there were 3,632 agricultural technology extension stations nationwide, and there have been increases this year. The number of agricultural technology extension stations in the Northeast region has increased from more than 900 last year to 1,060, and Anhui Province has newly established 68 agricultural technology extension stations this year.
    During the spring plowing production period, agricultural technology extension stations in various regions provided a series of technical guidance to local farmers in terms of crop cultivation, planting, seed selection, and pest and disease control, so that the quality of field operations has generally been improved. Before the spring plowing, agricultural technology extension stations in various regions of the Northeast region went deep into villages and settlements, and through forums with experienced farmers, technical research meetings, and other forms, starting from summarizing local high-yield experiences, they provided specific technical guidance for spring plowing field operations. Before the spring plowing, the extension stations in various parts of Liaodong Province trained more than 10,000 technicians for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Under the guidance of the extension stations, most of the seeds for more than 4,000 hectares of cotton fields in Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, were treated with warm water soaking and Ceresan dressing. All 840 cadres from 126 extension stations in Shaanxi Province, except for more than 200 who are currently receiving training, have gone deep into the countryside and provided specific guidance for spring plowing production based on the key to increased production in various situations, and have taught technology to farmers through various methods. During the cotton sowing period, the extension stations in various parts of Hebei Province promptly provided technical guidance on seed selection, soaking, dressing, seizing moisture, borrowing moisture for sowing, close planting, and checking seedlings, replanting, and protecting seedlings. This spring, agricultural technology extension work in Zhejiang Province has greatly developed compared with last year, and 84 percent of the paddy fields in Xindeng County have undergone salt water and mud water seed selection. Before transplanting rice seedlings, Yong'an and Ningyang counties in Fujian Province trained more than 1,000 rice seedling transplanters, and 80 percent of the paddy fields implemented close planting, generally shortening the row spacing by one to two inches on the original basis. The extension stations in various parts of Hunan Province focused on promoting five technologies: "early plowing, deep plowing," "cultivating strong seedlings," "uniform close planting," "rational fertilization," and "pest control," so that spring plowing in various places was generally advanced by six to ten days, and uniformly closely planted fields accounted for more than 50 percent of the total acreage. Xiangtan County trained more than 15,000 technicians in uniform close planting, an average of 53 people per township, and uniformly closely planted fields in the county accounted for about 82 percent of the total acreage.

    各地农业技术推广站
    帮助农民改进了春季田间作业
    为了帮助农民改进农业技术，促进农业生产互助合作运动的开展，国家在各地建立了一批农业技术推广站。到去年年底，全国已有农业技术推广站三千六百三十二个，今年又有增加。东北区的农业技术推广站，已由去年的九百多个增加到一千零六十个，安徽省今年新建立的农业技术推广站有六十八个。
    春耕生产期间，各地农业技术推广站在农作物的耕作、栽培、选种及防治病虫害等方面，对当地农民进行了一系列的技术指导，使田间作业质量普遍有所提高。东北区各地农业技术推广站在春耕以前，都深入村屯，通过老农座谈会、技术研究会等形式，从总结当地丰产经验入手，对春耕田间作业进行了具体的技术指导。辽东省各地推广站在春耕以前，为农业生产合作社、互助组培养和训练了一万多名技术员。在推广站的指导下，辽西省义县四千多垧棉田的种籽，大部分进行了温汤浸种和赛力散拌种。陕西全省一百二十六个推广站的八百四十多名干部，除正在受训练的二百多人以外，其余都深入农村，根据各种不同情况的增产关键，对春耕生产进行了具体指导，并通过各种方式，向农民传授了技术。河北省各地推广站在棉花播种期间，及时进行了关于粒选棉种、浸种、拌种、抢墒、借墒播种，密植及查苗、补苗、保苗等的技术指导。浙江省今春的农业技术推广工作比去年有很大开展，新登县水稻田经过盐水、泥水选种的，已占百分之八十四。福建省永安、宁洋两县在插秧前训练了一千多名插秧手，百分之八十的稻田实行了密植，普遍在原有基础上缩短株行距一到二寸。湖南省各地推广站着重推广了“早耕、深耕”、“培育壮秧”、
  “均匀密植”、“合理施肥”、“防治虫害”等五项技术，使各地春耕一般提早六天到十天，均匀密植的田，占总田亩数的百分之五十以上；湘潭县训练了均匀密植的技术人员一万五千多人，平均每乡五十三人，全县均匀密植的田，占总田亩数的百分之八十二左右。
