The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Youth Federation have separately issued notices to women's federations at all levels, Youth League organizations at all levels, and democratic youth federations at all levels, requesting them to publicize the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China to the broad masses of women and youth under the leadership of the local Communist Party organizations and the people's governments, and to organize study and discussion.

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation's notice first requires women's federations at all levels to earnestly, actively, and systematically conduct propaganda and organize discussions on the draft Constitution among the broad masses of women, so that the broad masses of women understand the significant political meaning of formulating the Constitution, the spirit and content of the draft Constitution, and the close relationship between the Constitution and the masses of women. The notice also requires women's federations at all levels to strive to further enhance the political consciousness of the masses of women, so that they not only enthusiastically and actively participate in the discussion of the draft Constitution, but also lay the foundation for a sense of law-abiding and responsibility to abide by the Constitution and safeguard its implementation with practical actions, and further enhance their high enthusiasm for loving the motherland and actively participating in socialist construction. To this end, the notice requires cadres of women's federations at all levels to earnestly study the draft Constitution, accurately understand the draft Constitution, and at the same time participate in and, through the local draft Constitution discussion committee, implement the principle of mobilizing both men and women, and promote all forces to conduct propaganda among the masses of women. When training propagandists for the draft Constitution, women's federation organizations at all levels should send a certain number of women propagandists to participate in the training, and participate in pilot work to publicize the draft Constitution. They should also keep abreast of the ideological situation of the masses of women, give full play to the strength of women's federation organizations, use grass-roots women's representative conferences to conduct "processing" and "make-up lessons" among the masses of women; in particular, they should go deep into families to conduct publicity and explanations, striving to achieve the effect that every woman hears the publicity and explanations, and mobilize as many women as possible to participate in the discussion.

The notice from the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League pointed out: The promulgation of the draft Constitution and the formal enactment of the Constitution are matters of great historical significance for our country. According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, during the period when the people of the whole country are discussing the draft Constitution, it has become the most important political task in our Youth League work to universally and deeply conduct propaganda and earnestly organize study and discussion among all Youth League members and young people across the country. It is also the most vivid and practical subject for conducting socialist education among young people across the country. The notice then pointed out: The main requirements for publicizing the draft Constitution and mobilizing young people across the country to study and discuss the draft Constitution are to enable them to understand the great significance of formulating the Constitution, the basic spirit and content of the draft Constitution, and the close relationship between the Constitution and the youth of our country. It is necessary to enable the broad masses of young people to fully understand the arduous road our country has experienced and the great goals ahead, understand the superiority of the people's democratic system, understand the basic rights and obligations of citizens, and understand the special care and ardent expectations of the country for young people, so as to further enhance the socialist consciousness of young people, carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism of being loyal to the people and working hard, establish a fine character of loving the motherland, working actively, studying hard, abiding by discipline, cherishing public property, and maintaining social morality. In different Youth League grass-roots organizations, the study and discussion of the draft Constitution should be combined with their own actual situation, and young people should be mobilized to use their pioneering role and exemplary role to complete the work, production and study tasks they undertake even better, and use these practical actions to express their support for the Constitution. In order to enable young people across the country to study and discuss the draft Constitution well, the notice requires Youth League cadres to take the lead in earnestly studying and researching it. In mobilizing the broad masses of young people inside and outside the League to participate in unified study and discussion, the Youth League organization can also, according to the characteristics of young people and according to specific conditions, take a variety of measures to deepen young people's understanding of the draft Constitution in a planned way. The opinions of the youth masses on the Constitution should be promptly forwarded to the local draft Constitution discussion committee. In addition, the provincial and municipal Youth League committees should also pay attention to publishing popular articles in the Youth League newspapers and periodicals explaining the basic content of the draft Constitution, and reporting on the discussion of the draft Constitution by the broad masses of Youth League members and young people, as well as the speeches and actions of supporting the draft Constitution. At the end of this work, the provincial and municipal Youth League committees must earnestly summarize it.

The notice from the All-China Youth Federation pointed out: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which is about to be formulated, will be the fundamental law of the country that must be observed by the people of the whole country and all state organs. It points out the correct path to strive for the realization of a great socialist society and will guide the broad masses of people and young people to more actively and consciously fight for the great cause of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of the national economy. Therefore, in addition to widely listening to the opinions of young people and reflecting them to the local draft Constitution discussion committee, organizing the propaganda and discussion of the draft Constitution among the broad masses of young people should also be conducted through this propaganda and discussion, on the basis of the general line study, to carry out a profound patriotic education for the broad masses of young people. It is necessary to enable young people to understand the main content of the draft Constitution, further understand the loveliness of the motherland and the superiority of the people's democratic system, so as to enhance their awareness and better strive for the great cause of socialist construction.
