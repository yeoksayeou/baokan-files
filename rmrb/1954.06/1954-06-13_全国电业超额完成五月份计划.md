    National Electricity Industry Exceeds May Plan
    [This newspaper] National state-owned power industry overfulfilled the May national production plan. The total industrial output value reached 100.7% of the plan; power generation reached 101.2%; major technical and economic indicators also exceeded the plan. In this month, power plants saved more than 500 million yuan in electricity consumption, and the coal consumption quota was reduced, saving approximately more than 2,000 tons of standard coal.
    Many power industrial enterprises across the country carried out pilot programs or preparations for establishing a one-chief system and a chief engineer system in May. At the end of April, the General Bureau of Electricity Management of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry organized a working group under the guidance of Soviet experts to conduct typical training work at the Shijingshan, Tangshan and other power plants. The Central South Electricity Management Bureau and the Central South Electricity Trade Union formed a joint working group to conduct pilot work at the First Power Plant. Electricity units in Northeast and East China also carried out preparatory work. In the preliminary pilot work, Shijingshan Power Plant has overcome the long-standing phenomenon of "too many meetings"; the plant director and chief engineer carried out their work in accordance with the scheduled "work schedule," overcoming the phenomenon of being too busy, and established a daily production meeting system.
    Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the decision to launch a technical innovation campaign nationwide, the technical innovation movement of electricity workers in various places has made new progress. Many units have used "grabbing topics" to exert the collective wisdom of the vast number of workers to solve key problems in production, and have also set off a surge of proposing rationalization proposals. For example, the workers of Baoding Power Plant put forward 179 rationalization proposals in May, of which 149 have been adopted. More than 80% of these proposals are about ensuring safe power generation and supply.
    At present, the national electricity industry's inter-plant safety competition has also made new progress. In addition to North China and Central South regions, which had already launched inter-plant safety competitions last year, in May, the Northeast region further launched inter-plant competitions in depth with the conditions of eliminating serious accidents, reducing frequent accidents, improving technical management level, and doing a good job in tidiness and hygiene. East China region is also actively carrying out preparatory work.

    全国电业超额完成五月份计划
    【本报讯】全国国营电力工业超额完成了五月份国家生产计划。工业总产值完成计划百分之一○○·七；发电量完成百分之一○一·二；主要技术经济指标也都超额完成，在这一月份里，发电厂节省厂用电价值五亿多元，煤耗定额降低节省约两千多吨标准煤。
    全国有不少的电力工业企业，在五月份进行了建立一长制和总工程师制的试点或准备工作。中央燃料工业部电业管理总局，在四月底就组织了在苏联专家指导下的工作组，到石景山、唐山等发电厂进行培养典型工作。中南电业管理局和中南电业工会组成联合工作组到第一发电厂进行试点工作。东北和华东等地的电业单位，也都进行了准备工作。石景山发电厂在初步试点工作中，已克服了长期存在的“会议多”的现象；厂长和总工程师按照预定的“工作日程计划表”进行工作，克服了忙乱现象，建立了每日的生产会议制度。
    在中华全国总工会发表关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定以来，各地电业职工的技术革新运动又有了新的进展。许多单位都通过“抢课题”来发挥广大职工的集体智慧，解决生产中的关键问题，同时也掀起了提合理化建议的热潮。如保定发电厂的职工，五月里就提出了一百七十九件合理化建议，已经采纳了一百四十九件，这些建议百分之八十以上是关于保证安全发供电的。
    目前，全国电力工业厂际安全竞赛也有了新的发展。除华北和中南区去年就已开展了厂际安全竞赛外，在五月份，东北区也进一步以消灭严重事故、减少频发事故、提高技术管理水平、做好整洁卫生为条件，深入地展开了厂际竞赛。华东地区也正在积极进行准备工作。
