Xinhua News Agency, 1st. According to Vietnam News Agency: Professor Hurel, representative of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Corps in Indochina, recently answered questions from a reporter of the Vietnamese "Save the Nation" newspaper regarding the evacuation of wounded and captured French soldiers from Dien Bien Phu.

Professor Hurel, in explaining the efforts made by the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, said: The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army dispatched engineering units of the Vietnamese People's Army to repair the metal runway for light aircraft; at the same time, it allowed light aircraft of various types of the French army to land; and allowed a Dakota aircraft to fly over the Dien Bien Phu basin in the morning to investigate weather conditions, in order to ensure the safety of the ambulance planes. The delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army was also responsible for concentrating the wounded and captured near the airport. Thanks to the arrangements made by the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army and its care for the wounded and captured, one hundred and fifty-one wounded and captured were evacuated in one day.

Professor Hurel said: The agreement signed by the delegations of both sides on May 13, 1954, which was later rejected by the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Corps, has always been considered valuable by the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, which implemented Chairman Ho Chi Minh's lenient policy. Thanks to this correct attitude, the work of evacuating the wounded and captured was not interrupted, thus avoiding any delays in the repatriation of the wounded and captured.

Regarding the results of the evacuation of wounded and captured French soldiers, Professor Hurel said: The French press and world newspapers have followed with great interest the evacuation of eight hundred and fifty-eight wounded and captured of various nationalities from the French Expeditionary Corps. These results have made these wounded and captured and their families deeply satisfied and reassured.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st. According to Vietnam News Agency: Wounded and captured French soldiers released by the Vietnamese People's Army wrote letters to Chairman Ho Chi Minh before leaving Dien Bien Phu to express their gratitude.

Sergeant Major Madan, formerly of the Third Battalion of the Third Algerian Field Regiment, expressed his heartfelt thanks to Chairman Ho Chi Minh in his letter. He said, we thank the Vietnamese People's Army for its correct attitude and care towards the wounded and captured. We are especially grateful to the medical staff of the Vietnamese People's Army for all the care they gave us and for their kind concern. Madan expressed in his letter his hope for the establishment of a lasting friendship between the French and Vietnamese people.

Sergeant Jean Biron, formerly of the First Colonial Parachute Battalion, said in his letter to Chairman Ho Chi Minh that in the past few days of living with the Vietnamese People's Army, we have learned that the wishes of the Vietnamese people are very similar to the wishes of the French people, namely: labor, peace, happiness and freedom. Jean Biron expressed in his letter his hope that Vietnam would soon return to peace.

Thirteen puppet soldiers wounded and released in Dien Bien Phu also wrote a letter to Chairman Ho Chi Minh to express their gratitude. They said in the letter that we have received careful care from the Vietnamese People's Army. We deeply regret that we were deceived by the French colonialists and betrayed our people. These thirteen wounded soldiers stated that they would never serve as puppet soldiers again after returning.

    印度支那法国远征军总部代表胡尔教授发表谈话
    感谢越南人民军安排和协助撤运法军伤俘
    被释放的奠边府法军伤俘写信感谢胡志明主席
    【新华社一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：印度支那法国远征军总司令部代表胡尔教授最近就撤运奠边府法军伤俘事回答了越南“救国报”记者的问题。
    胡尔教授在说明越南人民军总司令部代表团所作的努力时说：越南人民军总司令部代表团调遣越南人民军工兵部队修复了轻型飞机用的金属跑道；同时准许法军各种类型的轻型飞机降落；并让一架达科他式飞机在早晨飞到奠边府盆地上空调查气候情况，以保证救护机的安全。越南人民军总司令部代表团还负责把伤俘集中在机场附近。由于越南人民军总司令部代表团的安排和它对伤俘的照顾，曾经一天之内就撤运了一百五十一名伤俘。
    胡尔教授说：双方代表团于一九五四年五月十三日所签订的、后来被法国远征军总司令部所摒弃的协定，在执行胡志明主席的宽大政策的越南人民军总司令部代表团方面，一直认为是有价值的。由于这种正确的态度，撤运伤俘的工作没有中断，因此避免了遣返伤俘工作中的任何耽误。
    对于撤运法军伤俘的结果，胡尔教授说：法国报界和世界报纸以极大的兴趣注视着法国远征军的八百五十八名各种国籍的伤俘的撤运。这种结果使这些伤俘和他们的家属深感满意和放心。
    【新华社一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：被越南人民军释放的法军伤俘在离开奠边府以前写信给胡志明主席表示感谢。
    原属第三阿尔及利亚野战团第三营的伤俘马丹上士在信中对胡志明主席表示衷心的感谢。他说，我们感谢越南人民军对待伤俘和俘虏的正确态度和关怀。我们特别感激越南人民军的医疗工作人员给予我们的所有照顾，感激他们给予我们的仁慈关怀。马丹在信中表示希望法国和越南人民之间建立永久的友谊。
    原属殖民伞兵第一营的伤俘让·毕龙中士在写给胡志明主席的信中说，在过去几天和越南人民军相处的日子里，我们知道越南人民的愿望是和法国人民的愿望十分相同的，那就是：劳动、和平、幸福和自由。让·毕龙在信中表示希望越南早日恢复和平。
    在奠边府被释放的十三名伪军伤俘也写信给胡志明主席表示感谢。他们在信中说，我们受到了越南人民军的细心的照顾。我们深深地感到后悔，因为我们受了法国殖民者的诱骗背叛了我们的人民。这十三位伤俘表示他们回去以后将永不再充当伪军。
