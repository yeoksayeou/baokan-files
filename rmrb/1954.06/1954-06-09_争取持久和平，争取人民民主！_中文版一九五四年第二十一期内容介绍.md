"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Introduction to the Chinese Edition, 1954, Issue 21

The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" 1954, Issue 21, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Great Strength of the Leninist Organizational Principles." The editorial points out: Lenin, in his book "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," published fifty years ago, stipulated the basic organizational principles of a new type of party, for the first time expounding the theory of the party, explaining that the party is the leading organization of the proletariat, the fundamental weapon in the hands of the proletariat, without which it is impossible to overthrow the bourgeois regime, implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, and establish socialism and communism. The past fifty years have vividly proven the great vitality of the Leninist theory of the new type of party. Lenin attached great importance to the organization of the proletariat and the organization of the working-class party. The new type of party is the advanced, conscious, and organized detachment of the working class, armed with revolutionary theory, with the knowledge of the laws of social development and class struggle, and with the experience of the revolutionary movement. Whether the entire activity of the Communist and Workers' Parties can achieve success, whether they have strength, and whether they can accomplish their tasks depends entirely on whether they can connect with the broad masses of the people and gain the support of the people. The editorial finally emphasizes the importance of strengthening party unity, strengthening the party's ties with the masses, promoting inner-party democracy, implementing collective leadership, and developing criticism and self-criticism, all Leninist principles.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Vigorously Develop Agriculture in the Romanian People's Republic" by Gheorghe Apostol, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; "The Road to Struggle for and Safeguard Austrian Independence" by Johann Koplenig, Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party; and "The Future Tasks of the Communist Party of India" by Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India.

Apostol's article points out: The Romanian Workers' Party and the government have now placed the issue of agricultural development in a primary position. On the one hand, the Party and the government are further developing socialist industry in a planned way. On the other hand, they are leading the working class, the working peasants, and all working people to fight together to vigorously develop agriculture and increase the production of consumer goods. The grain issue is the key issue in our country's agricultural production. To completely solve the grain issue, fundamentally eliminate various supply difficulties, and ensure a high standard of living for all working people is inseparable from the completion of the socialist transformation of the countryside. In the struggle to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, our main task is to strengthen the existing collective farms organizationally and economically, making them examples to attract working peasants to embark on the road of socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, we must eradicate the tendency to let things drift in the matter of the socialist transformation of agriculture and help individual peasants improve their production level and improve their technical equipment.

Ghosh's article talks about the situation of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India held in April. The article introduces the analysis of the domestic and international situation since the Third Party Congress and several important resolutions on mass movements and party organizational work passed by the meeting. The article points out that the Central Committee of the Party believes that the main task of the Communist Party of India today is to carry out regular mass work in various ways on the political, economic, and ideological fronts.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第二十一期已经出版。
    本期以“列宁主义的组织原则的伟大力量”为题发表社论。社论指出：列宁在其五十年前出版的
  “进一步，退两步”一书中规定了新型政党的基本组织原则，第一次阐明了关于党的学说，说明党是无产阶级的领导组织，是无产阶级手中的基本武器，没有这个武器就不可能推翻资产阶级政权、实行无产阶级专政及建立社会主义和共产主义。过去的五十年已经生动地证明列宁主义关于新型政党的学说的伟大生命力。列宁非常重视无产阶级的组织，非常重视组织工人阶级的政党。新型政党是工人阶级的先进的、有觉悟的和有组织的部队，它是用革命理论、用社会发展规律和阶级斗争的知识以及革命运动的经验武装起来的。共产党和工人党的全部活动能否取得成就，它们是否有力量，能否完成自己的任务，完全决定于它们是否能联系广大人民群众和得到人民的支持。社论最后着重指出了加强党的团结、加强党与群众的联系、发扬党内民主、贯彻集体领导、展开批评和自我批评等列宁主义原则的重要性。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记格·阿波斯托尔的“大力发展罗马尼亚人民共和国的农业”，奥地利共产党主席约·柯普勒尼希的“争取和保障奥地利独立的道路”和印度共产党总书记阿·高士的“印度共产党今后的任务”等。
    阿波斯托尔的文章指出：罗马尼亚工人党和政府现在已经把发展农业的问题提到首要地位。党和政府一方面进一步有计划地发展社会主义工业，一方面领导工人阶级、劳动农民和全体劳动人民，共同为大力发展农业和增加消费品生产而斗争。谷物问题是我国农业生产的关键问题。要彻底解决谷物问题、根本消灭供应方面的各种困难并保证全体劳动人民的高度生活水平，是和完成农村的社会主义改造分不开的。在进行农业的社会主义改造的斗争中，我们的主要任务是要在组织上和经济上加强现有的集体农庄，使它们成为吸引劳动农民走上农业的社会主义改造的道路的榜样。同时，我们必须铲除在农业的社会主义改造问题上听其自流的偏向，并帮助个体农民提高生产水平、改进技术装备。
    高士的文章谈到了印度共产党中央委员会四月间举行全体会议的情形。文章介绍了会议对于第三次党代表大会举行以来的国内和国际形势的分析，以及会议通过的关于群众运动和党的组织工作的若干重要决议。文章指出，党中央委员会认为印度共产党今天的主要任务是：在政治、经济和思想等各个战线上，通过各种方式进行经常的群众工作。
