Xinhua News Agency: The organs directly under the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the various services and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, the organs and units of the North China Military Region stationed in Beijing, the various units of the Northeast Military Region stationed in Shenyang, the Southwest Military Region, and the cadres and commanders and combatants of the Central South Military Region warmly hailed the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    On the day the Draft Constitution was promulgated, the wired broadcasting station of the organs directly under the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission broadcast the full text of the Draft Constitution to all cadres and soldiers in the early morning. After the newspapers containing the Draft Constitution were delivered to various units, cadres and soldiers rushed to read and study them carefully. The wall newspapers in the organs also published special issues on the Draft Constitution, featuring articles by many cadres and soldiers. All cadres and staff members of the organs, units, and schools of the General Logistics Department stationed in Beijing also celebrated the promulgation of the Draft Constitution with excitement. Many people have already read the Draft Constitution two or three times.

    When the leading organs of an air force unit stationed in Beijing received the newspapers containing the Draft Constitution, they temporarily decided to take an hour to read the newspaper and have informal discussions in groups. On the airfield, mechanics inspecting aircraft and pilots held informal discussions under the wings. Pilot Wu Huazhen said, "The Draft Constitution stipulates that the task of the people's armed forces is to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to protect the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. As an air force soldier, I am determined to more vigilantly fulfill the responsibilities stipulated in the Draft Constitution." The Political Department of the Air Force directly affiliated organs also organized the first study report meeting on the Draft Constitution on the 17th.

    A naval unit stationed in Beijing, during a discussion, particularly discussed the provisions regarding the tasks of the armed forces. Everyone deeply felt the glory and importance of being a people's soldier. Everyone expressed their determination to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army in strictly abiding by government laws and decrees, and to celebrate the promulgation of the first people's draft constitution.

    The Political Department of the Railway Corps convened a meeting of responsible cadres of directly affiliated organs on the 17th to discuss the publicity and discussion of the Draft Constitution. The meeting decided on specific measures to organize all personnel to read and discuss the Draft Constitution.

    The cadres and soldiers of the Armored Forces Command also cheered this great historical document. Wang Jinan, a third-class merit recipient, said, "After reading the Draft Constitution, I have a deeper understanding of the greatness of our motherland. Our goal of realizing a socialist society is even clearer. I must conscientiously do my job well to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution."

    All commanders and combatants of the Public Security Forces stationed in Beijing welcomed the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China with great enthusiasm. Yang Xingwu, a hero of a certain unit, shed tears when he heard the broadcast of the Draft Constitution. He herded cattle for landlords from the age of eleven, his parents both starved to death, and his four sisters had nowhere to go. After liberation, he was allocated land and a house in his hometown and had a happy family. Now he sees that the Draft Constitution not only fixes the victorious achievements gained by our people but also stipulates that the people will be guaranteed a happier life. He said excitedly, "I fully support the Draft Constitution and faithfully fulfill the glorious duties of a revolutionary soldier." Many units, such as the directly affiliated team of a public security unit, the cultural fast-track school, and a certain public security regiment, held celebration meetings that afternoon.

    Cadres and soldiers of the searchlight and anti-aircraft artillery units stationed in Beijing enthusiastically discussed the Draft Constitution. Zhao Huanwen, the platoon leader of the fifth company of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, loudly read the Draft Constitution to the soldiers on the position. Afterwards, the soldiers began to discuss it, and the soldiers composed clappers to sing the praises of the Draft Constitution.

    Liao Changlin, a veteran Red Army cadre from a certain department of the headquarters of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who participated in the Long March, said, "Seeing our people's Draft Constitution reminds me of the arduous struggles of the past. This is the result of the heroic struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice of our people under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We must support the Draft Constitution!"

    The commanders and combatants of the various units of the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenyang generally felt very excited after seeing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China published in the newspaper. They rushed to read it, expressed their thoughts one after another, and unanimously agreed that the Draft Constitution is the great achievement of the long-term revolutionary struggle of our people. Yang Shishou, the company commander of a certain unit and a first-class merit recipient who was participating in voluntary labor in the urban area of Shenyang, saw the Draft Constitution published in the newspaper at the construction site and said excitedly to his comrades, "Now we are participating in voluntary labor for socialist construction, and we are determined to work harder to improve labor efficiency to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution." The cadres and soldiers of a certain company of the Public Security Forces, who were guarding a factory, immediately began discussions after seeing the Draft Constitution.

    The commanders and combatants of the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly welcomed and supported the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Public Security soldiers Long Jingxiong and Zhang Junyu, guarding a certain factory, returned from guarding the steelmaking furnace. When they heard that the Draft Constitution had been promulgated, although they were covered in sweat, they couldn't even bother to wipe it off and rushed to find a newspaper to read. After listening to the broadcast of the Draft Constitution and reading the newspaper, the Public Security soldiers held a forum. Many soldiers expressed that we must carefully discuss the Draft Constitution and continue to improve our political and military qualities to be sentinels of socialist construction. The troops stationed on the Yunnan border listened to the broadcast of the Draft Constitution on the border line of high mountains and ridges. The commanders and combatants were very happy. They said: Over the past few years, we have guarded the gate of the motherland and have not relaxed the duties of the people's army in the slightest. Today, the state's Draft Constitution clearly stipulates the tasks of the people's armed forces. We must be more vigilant and faithfully fulfill the duties of the people's army. Many ethnic minority soldiers in the various units of the Southwest Military Region also expressed their support for the Draft Constitution. The Sichuan Military Region troops are currently actively carrying out activities to publicize the Draft Constitution. The Political Department of the Guizhou Military Region is also organizing propagandists to publicize the Draft Constitution to the troops and the masses in the garrison.

    The commanders and combatants of the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly supported the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China and actively prepared to launch publicity and discussion. Commanders, combatants, staff members, students, and convalescents of the various organs, units, schools, and hospitals of the entire army felt that the Draft Constitution brought them new strength and a firm belief in defending the motherland. After the promulgation of the Draft Constitution, the Political Department of the Central South Military Region issued instructions, making specific arrangements for the work of publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution throughout the army. The leading organs of the Central South Military Region also decided to hold a report meeting on the Draft Constitution on the 19th, and the various units will also hold report meetings in their respective garrisons.
