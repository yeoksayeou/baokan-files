Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan - Forty-seven state-owned and locally-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have overfulfilled the first half-year's national production plan ahead of schedule by the end of May. These factories and mines include the state-owned Yangquan Mining Bureau, the locally-owned Hanhegou Coal Mine, Taiyuan Iron Factory, Yuncheng Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Flour Mill, Yuci Flour Mill, Datong Flour Mill, Linfen Flour Mill, Taiyuan Printing and Dyeing Factory, and Taiyuan Leather Factory. From January to May, these factories and mines have completed 58.87 percent of the annual national plan, an increase of 53.17 percent compared with the same period last year.

These units are also better in comprehensively fulfilling the national plan. For example, the Yangquan Mining Bureau, Taiyuan Flour Mill, Yuci Flour Mill, and Taiyuan Printing and Dyeing Factory have all reduced the cumulative product cost from January to May by 2.6 to 15.72 percent compared with the original plan. From January to May, 100% of all products from the Taiyuan Flour Mill met the standards. Currently, the workers of these factories and mines are stepping up preparations for the second half-year's production, further carrying out the technical innovation movement and improving management to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual national plan.
   Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th - The state-owned Asia Steel Plant in Shanghai has completed this year's first half-year's production tasks half a month ahead of schedule. As of June 14, the total output value of the plant has exceeded the first half-year's national plan by 19.39 percent. The output of major products such as high-quality steel ingots, carbon steel ingots, and steel castings has exceeded the plan. Among them, the output of high-quality steel ingots exceeded the plan by 10.63 percent.

The labor productivity of workers at the Asia Steel Plant has also increased in the first half of this year. In May, the average production value of each worker in the plant increased by more than 3.4 million yuan compared to January.

In the first quarter, the employees of the Asia Steel Plant actively studied advanced experiences, which continuously improved the production level. In May, the time for each furnace of steel in the smelting workshop was shortened by about half an hour compared with the target; a total of 150 hours of steelmaking time was saved throughout the month, and many more furnaces of steel were produced. After the foundry workshop implemented advanced experiences such as high-pressure risers, blind risers, and template molding in the first half of this year, a large amount of molten steel was saved, and the quality and output were improved.

    提前完成上半年国家生产计划
    上海亚细亚钢铁厂上半年生产任务提前完成
    【新华社太原电】山西省已有四十七个国营和地方国营厂矿，在五月底提前超额完成了上半年的国家生产计划。这些厂矿包括国营的阳泉矿务局，地方国营的汉河沟煤矿、太原铁工厂、运城机械厂、太原面粉厂、榆次面粉厂、大同面粉厂、临汾面粉厂、太原印染厂、太原皮革厂等。这些厂矿一月到五月份总计已完成全年国家计划百分之五十八点八七，和去年同期比较，提高了百分之五十三点一七。
    这些单位在全面地完成国家计划方面也是较好的。如阳泉矿务局、太原面粉厂、榆次面粉厂、太原印染厂等单位，一月到五月份累计的产品成本都比原计划降低百分之二点六到十五点七二。太原面粉厂一月到五月份的全部产品质量都百分之百的达到标准。现在，这些厂矿的职工正在加紧进行下半年生产的准备工作，进一步开展技术革新运动和改进管理工作，以保证超额完成全年的国家计划。
   【新华社上海十八日电】上海国营亚细亚钢铁厂已提前半个月完成了今年上半年的生产任务。到六月十四日止，全厂的生产总值已超过上半年国家计划百分之十九点三九。优质钢锭、炭素钢锭、钢铸件等主要产品的产量，都已超过了计划。其中优质钢锭的产量超过计划百分之十点六三。
    亚细亚钢铁厂工人的劳动生产率，在今年上半年也有了提高。五月份全厂每个工人的生产价值，平均比一月份增加了三百四十多万元。
    亚细亚钢铁厂的职工在第一季度积极学习了先进经验，使生产水平不断提高。五月份冶炼车间每炼一炉钢的时间，比指标缩短了半小时左右；全月共节省了一百五十小时的炼钢时间，多炼出了许多炉钢。翻砂车间今年上半年推行了高气压冒口、暗冒口、型板造型等先进经验后，节约了大量钢水，并提高了质量和产量。
