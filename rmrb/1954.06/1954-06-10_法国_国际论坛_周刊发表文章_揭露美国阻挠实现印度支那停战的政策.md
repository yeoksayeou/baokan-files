Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th. The Paris weekly "International Forum," published on the 4th, featured an article by André Ulmann on its front page, titled "In Indochina and Elsewhere, France's Choice Remains: War or Peace," commenting on France's policy in Geneva and the United States' obstruction of a peaceful resolution to the Indochina issue.

   "International Forum" said: Nowhere can we understand better than in Geneva how a group is influencing French policy and what the consequences of this situation are. The weekly said: With a political and parliamentary trick, France has given itself another eight days to decide again on its policy towards Indochina. … In order to clarify the French situation, Mr. Bidault said: The Geneva negotiations have made real progress; please do not hinder me from seeking a delicate situation. It is not enough for Mr. Bidault to say this kind of thing. It is a much-used political blackmail. Of course, the Geneva negotiations have indeed made considerable progress in six weeks, but Mr. Bidault has nothing to do with this progress—quite the contrary. On the other hand, the negotiations have reached such a delicate stage that relieving Mr. Bidault of his responsibilities would not make the negotiations more difficult—but quite the contrary.

   "International Forum" said, referring to the attitude taken by the United States in the negotiations over the past week: Smith accepted Eden's plan "silently and angrily." Since then, Smith has been looking for an opportunity to take real revenge. This explains why he decided to determine the course of action on the pre-prepared position on the issues of supervision and guarantees.

   "International Forum" said: At this time, the United States, Britain, France, Australia, and New Zealand held a five-nation military conference in Washington. Here, we can see the US plan to conclude an Asian military and strategic pact. We said at the beginning of this conference that this plan was the main goal of Mr. Dulles, the State Department, and the Pentagon.

   "International Forum" implied that Bidault played an important role in all of this. "International Forum" continued: Some advisors to the French delegation—not unimportant figures—are still saying: Only by playing the American card 100% in front of the communist bloc, or by threatening until the last second that the United States has been persuaded to participate in the war, can we hope to obtain the necessary (if we believe this argument) concessions from the communists in Indochina.

   "International Forum" further stated: We can see the danger of this game. One of the most ardent proponents of this argument spoke of this danger, saying: The danger is twofold, and its consequences are impossible to estimate. First, we do not know to what extent Bidault is playing this game. We even have reason to believe that he is not playing a game, and believes that the desire to get the United States to participate in the war and make the war clearly internationalized is a matter of life and death, and that he has submitted to this need. The second danger is equally important, namely that the United States, after the necessary delays for preparation, will also put away its cards and plunge into a tragic reality. … Internationalizing the war, and ultimately expanding the war to the entire Asia.

   "International Forum" concluded: These factors must be synthesized and presented to the government and our parliamentarians. If French foreign policy is indeed on the verge of a nervous breakdown, then Parliament and public opinion should be reminded that Parliament and public opinion should take action and should take political action based on new facts, and in this regard, the timing has never been more ripe than now.

   The same issue of "International Forum" weekly also published an article entitled "The US Plan to Continue the Indochina War." The article said: The US plan to continue the Indochina War is about to be implemented. The article, based on information from a document sent by Washington to Smith after the US National Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Indochina, detailed the US plan. According to that document, the article summarized the important conclusions of the US National Security Council as follows:

   1. The first consequence of a political solution to the Indochina peace issue, under conditions where the communists maintain their advantage, will be to strengthen all nationalist movements in Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, such a solution does not conform to the basic purpose of the United States' policy in this region.

   2. Therefore, the task of the US delegation at the Geneva Conference is to obstruct this solution in every possible way, or to obstruct any political agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina on a larger scale. If this is not possible, the agreement must not contain any conditions that could hinder or prohibit the resumption of hostilities in the future—if one of the Western countries deems it necessary—or make it difficult. In this case, the armistice itself should mainly be used to reorganize the French-Vietnamese forces and immediately prepare for the Indochina War.

   3. At the same time, the US delegation should not object to the French delegation shifting all responsibility for taking this attitude to the United States itself and US policy. On the contrary, the National Security Council believes that this is an opportunity to implement a real political shift. This shift would allow the United States to take a series of actions in Indochina without being affected by the domestic situation in France, which often makes it difficult to implement plans in this regard. Similarly, bilateral agreements must be rapidly concluded between the United States and members of the French Union within the framework of "common security," and the necessity of replacing existing governments with those that are more willing to act in accordance with US plans should also be considered.

   4. Since the current French government does not seem to object to the internationalization of the Indochina War in some form, a Southeast Asian security treaty must be concluded as soon as possible to rapidly implement this internationalization.

   5. Whether considered from the perspective of domestic or foreign policy, it is important for the US government to try to get British and American troops to participate in this action and in possible new military operations in Indochina.

    揭露美国阻挠实现印度支那停战的政策
   【新华社日内瓦七日电】四日出版的巴黎“国际论坛”周刊在首页地位以“在印度支那和其他地方，法国的抉择仍旧是：战争还是和平”作标题登载了安德烈·余尔门的一篇文章，评论法国在日内瓦的政策以及美国阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决。
    “国际论坛”说：在日内瓦，我们比在其他任何地方更能够了解一个集团在如何左右法国的政策，以及这种情况的后果是什么。周刊说：用一种政治和议会的把戏，法国又给了它自己八天的时间来再次决定它对于印度支那问题的政策。……为了澄清法国的局面，皮杜尔先生说：日内瓦谈判已取得了真正的进展，请不要阻挠我寻求一种微妙的局面。皮杜尔光是说这一类的话是不够的。这是一种用得太多的政治讹诈。当然，日内瓦谈判在六个星期中确实取得了相当大的进展，但是皮杜尔先生和这种进展毫无关系——而是正好相反。另一方面，谈判已经达到这样一个微妙的阶段，就是解除皮杜尔先生的责任不会使谈判更加困难——而是正好相反。
    “国际论坛”谈到美国过去一周在谈判中所采取的态度时说：史密斯“沉默和愤怒地”接受了艾登的计划。从那时起，史密斯一直在找寻采取真正报复的时机。这说明了他为什么决定要确定在预先准备好的关于监督和保证问题的立场上的方针。
    “国际论坛”说：就在这个时候，美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚和新西兰在华盛顿举行了五国军事会议。这里，我们可以看到美国的关于缔结亚洲军事和战略公约的计划。我们在这个会议开始时就说，这个计划是杜勒斯先生、国务院和五角大楼的主要目标。
    “国际论坛”暗示说：对所有这些事情，皮杜尔都起了一种重要的作用。“国际论坛”继续写道：法国代表团的某些顾问——并非不重要的人物——还在说：只有在共产党集团面前百分之百地玩弄美国这张王牌，或者在最后一秒钟以前还是扬言美国已被说服参加战争，才能希望从共产党那里得到在印度支那的必不可少的（假使我们相信这种论点的话）让步。
    “国际论坛”又说：我们可以看出这种玩意的危险。有一位鼓吹这种论调最力的人谈到这种危险说：危险是双重的，它的后果是不可能估计到的。第一，我们不知道皮杜尔的玩意玩到什么地步了。我们甚至有理由相信，他不是在玩牌，并相信，对于他来说，使美国参加战争并使战争明确地国际化的愿望是一种有关生死的需要，而他已经服从了这种需要。第二重危险是同样重要的，那就是美国在经过了必要的为从事准备而进行的拖延以后，也会收起牌来，投入一个悲剧的现实中去。……使战争国际化，最后把战争扩大到整个亚洲。
    “国际论坛”最后写道：必须把这些因素加以综合，并向政府和我们的议员们提出。假若法国的外交政策的确濒于神经衰弱的状态，那就应该提醒议会和舆论，议会和舆论应该采取行动，应该根据新的事实采取政治行动，而在这方面，时机从来没有现在这样成熟。
    同一期的“国际论坛”周刊还刊载了一篇题为“美国继续印度支那战争的计划”的文章。这篇文章说：美国继续印度支那战争的计划就要实行了。这篇文章并根据在美国国家安全委员会开会讨论了印度支那局势问题以后，由华盛顿送给史密斯的一个文件的情报，详细地介绍了美国的计划。这篇文章根据那个文件将美国国家安全委员会的重要结论摘述如下：
    一、在共产党保持优势的条件下，印度支那和平问题的政治解决的第一个后果，将是加强东南亚各国的一切民族主义运动。因此，这样的一种解决办法不符合美国在这一地区的政策的基本目的。
    二、因此，美国代表团在日内瓦会议上的任务是千方百计地阻挠这种解决办法，或是在更大的规模上阻挠在停止印度支那敌对行动的问题上达成任何政治协议。如果这样做不可能的话，绝不能使这种协定包含可以妨碍、禁止在将来恢复敌对行动——如果西方国家之一认为有必要的话——或使之发生困难的任何条件。在这种情况下，停战本身主要应当被用来整顿法越部队及立刻为印度支那战争进行必要准备。
    三、同时，美国代表团不应反对让法国代表团把采取这种态度的全部责任推到美国自己和美国政策身上。相反地，国家安全委员会认为这是实行真正的政治转移的机会。这种转移可以让美国不受法国国内局势的影响而在印度支那采取一系列的行动，按法国国内的局势往往使实现这方面的计划发生困难。同样，美国和法兰西联邦成员国之间必须在“共同安全”的范畴内，迅速签订双边协定，而且，以那些更愿意按照美国计划办事的政府来代替现有政府的必要性，也应当得到考虑。
    四、目前的法国政府既然似乎并不反对以某种形式把印度支那战争国际化，必须尽速缔结东南亚安全条约来迅速实行这种国际化。
    五、无论从内政政策还是从外交政策上来考虑，美国政府设法使英国军队和美国军队一起来参加这种行动和一起来参加印度支那可能发生的新的军事行动是很重要的。
