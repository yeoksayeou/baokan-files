The successful straight release experiment of rafts on the Nanping-Fuzhou section of the Min River in Fujian Province is of great significance for timber rafting operations in Fujian Province.

For nearly a hundred years, timber rafting operations along the entire Min River have been characterized by an unreasonable situation where feudal "Ba Tou" (bosses) dominated their respective areas, keeping the secrets of dangerous shoals and waterways, and forming a long-term pattern of segmented transshipment. At that time, timber released from Nanping could only reach Shuikou, timber released from Shuikou could only reach Zhuqi, and timber released from Zhuqi could only reach Hongshan Bridge. The short section from Hongshan Bridge to Fuzhou even required another group of people for transportation. This not only increased many unnecessary exchange procedures but also wasted a large amount of manpower and financial resources. After liberation, through various democratic movements, the feudal rule of the "Ba Tou" system was destroyed, and the situation improved somewhat. Workers had canceled the handover procedures for the Zhuqi section, but due to unfamiliarity with the port and shoal conditions in other sections, transportation was still carried out in segments. After the propaganda of the general line last winter and this spring, more than 3,300 workers along the river received universal and profound education, and initially recognized the important significance of carrying out production increase and thrift in timber production. In February of this year, they responded to the call of the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau and successfully organized two straight release experiments of rafts by early March. The results of the straight release shortened the rafting time between Nanping and Fuzhou, a total distance of 400 li, from the past five to seven days to only four days. Manpower savings were reduced from twelve people per "kang" (eight rafts linked together) to only eight people. According to the usual amount of timber rafting in the Min River basin, if the straight release method can be universally applied, it can save more than 1.7 billion yuan for the country annually and reduce the need for more than 10,000 workers.

    福建省闽江南平福州段
    木排直放试验成功
    福建省木材流送作业上具有很大意义的闽江南平福州间木排直放试验已获得成功。
    近百年来，整个闽江木材流送作业由于封建把头制度各霸一方，沿江险滩港道各守秘密，长期形成各据一段辗转接运的不合理局面。那时由南平放出木材只能到达水口，水口放出木排只能到达竹岐，竹岐放出木排只能到达洪山桥，洪山桥到福州一小段间还要换一批人运送。这不但增加许多不必要的交换手续，而且浪费大批人力财力。解放后经过各种民主运动，摧毁了封建把头统治制度，情况有所改变，工人曾把竹岐一段交接手续取消了，但其他各段因港道滩险情况外地工人不熟，仍然分段接运。经过去冬今春总路线的宣传，沿江三千三百多个工人受到了普遍深刻的教育，初步认识了在木材生产中开展增产节约的重要意义，今年二月间响应了省森林工业局的号召，至三月上旬前后两次组织木排直放试验成功。直放结果，使南平福州间全长四百里的木排流送时间从已往的五天到七天缩短到仅需四天，人力节约由过去每扛（八连）十二人节省到只需八人；按照闽江流域通常木排流送数量，直放办法如能普遍运用，全年可为国家节约十七亿多元，而且可少用一万多个人工。
