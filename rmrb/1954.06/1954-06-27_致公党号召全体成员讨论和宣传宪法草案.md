The notice stated: The Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China is a truly democratic draft constitution, which concentrates the common will and common demands of all the people of our country; at the same time, it also cares about the rights and interests of overseas compatriots and returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in China. In addition to warmly supporting it, our party comrades must also, under the unified leadership of the local constitution draft discussion committees, enthusiastically and conscientiously participate in the discussion and study of the constitution draft, actively organize the study and discussion of the constitution draft among party members and the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives with whom they are connected, and widely publicize the constitution draft to the masses, mobilizing the masses to actively put forward their opinions on the constitution draft. The notice also required organizations at all levels to mobilize their local members and the returned overseas Chinese and their relatives with whom they are connected to write letters to relatives and friends overseas, correctly explaining the content of the constitution draft. The notice finally called on everyone to strive to transform their own thinking and behavior and fight for the construction of a socialist motherland.
