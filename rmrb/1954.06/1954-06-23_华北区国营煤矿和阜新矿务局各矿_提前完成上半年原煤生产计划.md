    State-owned Coal Mines in North China Region and Various Mines of Fuxin Mining Bureau
    Complete First Half of Year's Raw Coal Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    [Reported by this newspaper] State-owned coal mines under the North China Coal Mining Administration have completed the first half of the year's national production plan on June 21. It is estimated that by the end of June, they will exceed the national plan by more than 400,000 tons, an increase of 47 percent over the same period last year.
    In the first half of this year, state-owned coal mines in North China strengthened planning management. More than 95 percent of the working faces in the region had operation plans, reversing the previous situation of slack production before and tight production after in coal mines. In February, various mines focused on production propaganda before and after the Spring Festival. The attendance rate of workers reached 90 percent, enabling February to exceed the national production plan by 11 percent, an increase of 72 percent over the same period last year. Various mines have strengthened holiday maintenance and planned maintenance of mechanical equipment. For example, more than 460 pieces of mechanical equipment were repaired during the Spring Festival, preventing the occurrence of major hidden accidents. In addition, various mines have initially established geological institutions, began to pay attention to production geology and tunneling work, and promoted the parallel crack method on the basis of multi-channel tunneling method, which improved the tunneling progress and ensured the continuous production of coal mines.
    Now, the staff and workers of various mines are working hard to complete the annual production plan ahead of schedule.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Fuxin Mining Bureau overfulfilled the first half of the year's national raw coal production plan 18 days ahead of schedule. As of June 12, the total output of the bureau has completed 100.5 percent of the first half of the year's plan.
    In the first half of this year, the Fuxin Mining Bureau further strengthened planning management and technical management, reversing the previous situation of slack production before and tight production after. Not only did the overall output complete the plan on a monthly basis, but also, among the affiliated mines, except for the Ping'an Mine, which did not complete the plan in February, all of them overfulfilled the task on a monthly basis. Due to the vigorous organization of regular cyclic operations, strengthening tunneling work, concrete solutions to several key engineering technical problems, and the implementation of technical operation regulations, except for February, the wellhead output has exceeded the plan every month. From January to May of last year, the overall wellhead output did not complete the plan in any month. All the staff and workers in the mining area are now actively learning and promoting advanced Soviet experience in the labor competition centered on technological innovation, striving to achieve greater victories in the second half of the year.

    华北区国营煤矿和阜新矿务局各矿
    提前完成上半年原煤生产计划
    【本报讯】华北煤矿管理局所属国营煤矿已在六月二十一日完成了上半年国家生产计划，预计到六月底可超过国家计划四十余万吨，比去年同期增加百分之四十七。
    今年上半年，华北各国营煤矿加强了计划管理，全区百分之九十五以上的工作面都有了作业计划，扭转了历年来煤矿生产前松后紧的情况。在二月份，各矿抓紧了春节前后的生产宣传工作，工人出勤率达到百分之九十，使二月份超额百分之十一完成了国家生产计划，比去年同期提高了百分之七十二。各矿都加强了假期检修和机械设备的计划检修工作，如春节检修机械设备四百六十余件，防止了重大隐形事故的发生。此外，各矿初步建立了地质机构，开始重视生产地质和掘进工作，并在多孔道掘进法的基础上，推广了平行龟裂法，提高了掘进进度，使煤矿连续生产得到了保证。
    现在，各矿职工正为提前完成全年生产计划而努力。
    【本报讯】阜新矿务局提前十八天超额完成了上半年国家原煤生产计划。到六月十二日，全局总产量已完成上半年计划的百分之一百点五。
    阜新矿务局在今年上半年进一步加强计划管理与技术管理，扭转了历年来前松后紧的情况。全局不仅产量按月完成计划，在所属各矿中除平安矿二月份未完成计划外，都按月超额完成了任务。由于大力组织正规循环作业，加强掘进工作，具体地解决了若干关键性的工程技术问题，贯彻技术作业规程，除二月份外，井口产量各月都超额完成，而去年一月至五月份，全局井口产量没有一个月完成计划。矿区全体职工现正在以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛中，进一步积极学习与推广苏联先进经验，争取在下半年中取得更大的胜利。
