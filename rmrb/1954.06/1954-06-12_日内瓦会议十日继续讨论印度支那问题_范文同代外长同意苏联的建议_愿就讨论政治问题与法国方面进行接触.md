Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 10th: The Geneva Conference continued its plenary session discussing the Indochina issue on the 10th. British representative Eden served as chairman.

　　Eden first spoke in his capacity as the British representative. Eden said: Two days of open discussion have clarified the differences between the two sides, and in his opinion, have also deepened these differences.

　　Eden then talked about the British delegation's opinions on three main issues. First, Eden said: Everyone has agreed that the cessation of hostilities should be simultaneous and that the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam should be studied first. Eden expressed the hope that he would soon hear the results of the meeting between the representatives of the two command headquarters.

　　Second, Eden talked about the issue of armistice supervision. On the issue of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, he reiterated the British delegation's proposal that the Neutral Nations Commission should be composed of India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Burma. He said: He believes that an institution composed of four countries, with two countries supporting one side's point of view, will only create a "stalemate." Eden said: His reason for refusing to do so is not ideological, but simply because it is "unworkable." However, everyone knows that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for supervising the Korean armistice has basically completed its task.

　　Eden believes that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should make decisions by majority vote when no agreement can be reached, and there should be no veto power. Here, Eden negated the principle of unanimous agreement, which is an important guarantee of post-war international cooperation.

　　Eden said: He believes that a joint supervisory committee composed of the belligerent parties can do useful work in Vietnam. However, he also said: This committee will have differences, and may often have differences. Eden said: It is here that the international committee will play its role. He believes that this international committee will always try to mediate disputes. However, he also believes that when mediation is unsuccessful, the international committee should have the right to make decisions.

　　The third issue Eden talked about was the issue of Cambodia and Laos. Eden repeated the already refuted assertion, slandering the Vietnam People's Army for "invading" Cambodia and Laos. However, even he himself could not completely deny the existence of the Cambodian and Laotian people's resistance movement.

　　Eden said: Negotiations between the representatives of the two command headquarters are underway. However, he believes that the current differences on the issue of armistice supervision and the future of Cambodia and Laos are "broad and deep." Eden said: Unless these differences can be narrowed without delay, we cannot complete our mission. We have tried every feasible procedure we can think of to help our work. We have no other choice but to overcome these differences or admit defeat. Eden stated that the British delegation is still willing to try to overcome these differences in plenary sessions, limited sessions, or in any other way that everyone may be willing to take. However, he also said that if the positions of all parties remain as they are today, then our clear responsibility is to explain this to the world and admit that we have failed.

　　Everyone knows that the open discussions of the past two days have fully demonstrated that the responsibility for artificially creating the current differences lies with the Western countries. In these two days of discussion, the delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and China have all put forward constructive suggestions to advance the progress of the conference. If they are sincere in restoring peace in Indochina, the Western countries should seriously consider these suggestions.

　　Cambodian representative Tep Phan then spoke. In his speech, Tep Phan routinely slandered the Cambodian National Liberation Movement and the resistance government. Tep Phan also expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Asian countries such as India and Pakistan did not recognize his government. However, he could not help but admit that these countries did not recognize the Cambodian government because they did not believe that the regime was "independent."

　　Vietnamese Democratic Republic representative Pham Van Dong spoke. Pham Van Dong first talked about the issue of Cambodia and Laos. He pointed out: The absurd distortion of facts by the representatives of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos cannot deceive anyone. The fact is: the Cambodian and Laotian people, closely united, have been and are waging a war of resistance against the imperialist aggressors. This war of resistance includes people from all walks of life in the two countries and covers the entire territory of the two countries. The Cambodian people enthusiastically support the proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Geneva Conference with their actions.

　　Pham Van Dong also recounted the history of the Laotian and Cambodian people's resistance and described the economic construction and democratic reforms carried out by the Cambodian and Laotian people in the course of the resistance.

　　Pham Van Dong pointed out that the claim that the governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos have obtained "independence" from France is false. In fact, the domestic affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, economy, finance, culture, and education of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos are all controlled by the French. In the economic aspect, all relatively important enterprises are in the hands of the French. In the military aspect, the puppet troops of these two countries are commanded by the commander-in-chief of the French forces in Indochina.

　　After pointing out that the claim that the Vietnamese People's Army has "invaded" Cambodia and Laos is completely inconsistent with the facts, Pham Van Dong said: In order to restore peace in Cambodia and Laos, the truth must be taken into account. It cannot be imagined that the problem can be easily solved with the so-called "Viet Minh invasion." The national liberation movements of Cambodia and Laos are the same as the national liberation movements of Vietnam and other countries.

　　Pham Van Dong then talked about the issue of Vietnam's unification. Pham Van Dong pointed out that Bao Dai's so-called "unification" is to unify Vietnam under Bao Dai alone. Obviously, this is a denial of the most basic concepts of people's rights and democracy and is a contempt for reality. The "unification" envisioned by the Bao Dai delegation is to make the imperialists enslave all the Vietnamese people. On the contrary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward a reasonable and practical plan to achieve Vietnam's unification. According to this plan, Vietnam's unification must be realized according to the will of the people. This unification can only be achieved through free, democratic elections without any foreign interference. However, in order to hold this election, the prerequisite is to achieve a ceasefire, implement a ceasefire and study and demarcate the assembly areas of both sides. There is no other way. Precisely because of this, the conference agreed to the proposals put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in this regard.

　　Pham Van Dong pointed out that Bao Dai's representatives clamor against division. The problem is that they are unwilling to hold free and general elections, they are afraid of the people. Pham Van Dong then cited many remarks from French and American newspapers to illustrate that Bao Dai has no prestige or authority among the Vietnamese people. Pham Van Dong said: Precisely because of this, Bao Dai's representatives put forward a proposal that everyone knows is absurd and unacceptable, with the purpose of obstructing the work of the conference, obstructing the restoration of peace, continuing and expanding the war, so as to maintain a regime that serves foreign countries and exploits and oppresses the people.

　　Pham Van Dong then talked about the issue of national independence. Pham Van Dong especially pointed out the falseness of the treaties signed between Bao Dai and France. Pham Van Dong also cited the words of French military advisers and generals about the low morale of the Bao Dai army to illustrate that the Vietnamese people do not believe at all that they have gained independence.

　　Pham Van Dong said: Based on the above, the proposals submitted by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the conference on May 10th are of particular and real importance.

　　1. First of all, the principle of independence of Vietnam and other countries in Indochina should be recognized. This should be complete, real, practical, unconditional, and not false independence. France should bear its responsibilities.

　　2. France's recognition of the independence of the three Indochinese countries involves the principled question of withdrawing foreign troops occupying the three countries. Because the former is the result of the latter. If, as we propose, the Indochinese countries can establish friendly relations with France on the basis of equality and mutual benefit in the future, then what is the use of the French expeditionary force? But if the hardliners who advocate a new colonial war want to realize their attempts, then naturally there is every reason to say that the French expeditionary force will inevitably suffer defeat.

　　3. After the ceasefire, a general election must be able to be held within six months. This is a fundamental, broad, and simple basis for discussing Vietnam's unification, which is of utmost concern to all Vietnamese people and people friendly to our country. Vietnam's unification is an inviolable principle. No one has ever thought that this would become a problem. So we suggest to all Vietnamese people, regardless of their class, gender, political and religious beliefs, to join us in realizing our country's unification in the only way required by the current situation, which is to hold free and democratic elections.

　　These are some of the main issues concerning the various countries of Indochina, and now we should mention the relationship between these countries and France, especially the economic and cultural relationship. More and more (French) delegations are visiting us in Geneva and expressing their sympathy and support for our proposal to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality and friendship. When they hear us talk about the possibility of our country joining the French Union, they are deeply moved.

　　After the regional adjustments, consideration should be given to ensuring the life, property, freedom, security, and personal democratic rights of supporters on either side.

　　Pham Van Dong pointed out: The above are some of the main issues in the political aspect of restoring peace in Indochina, and these are the issues that we need to discuss at the conference, and also the issues that have already occurred in our actual lives.

　　Pham Van Dong pointed out that in order to restore peace in Indochina, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward fair and reasonable proposals. On the one hand, this proposal will give the Vietnamese people peace, independence, unification, and democracy, and on the other hand, it will enable the Vietnamese and French people to establish friendly relations. Currently, everyone understands that all the proposals of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are based on a pragmatic spirit, respect for the legitimate interests of both sides, and a clear sense of responsibility. Pham Van Dong said that he hopes that the French delegation will also adopt this attitude and policy, be consistent in words and deeds, instead of talking about peace on the one hand, while supporting a government that denies peace and engaging in negotiations that will inevitably lead to adventure. Is this sincere and logical? Some people complain that we have said unpleasant things. It is useless to be picky about the wording; the facts must be responsible. For the sake of the cause of peace and understanding between peoples, the above facts must be specially pointed out.

　　Pham Van Dong finally said: Ceasefire negotiations are underway, and representatives of the two command headquarters have already made contact in Geneva. The same contact must also begin in Indochina. This is an encouraging fact. But both sides must express the same will to reach an agreement. The Geneva Conference is to seek peace in Indochina, and the belligerent parties are most relevant to the issue, so direct contact between the two sides is necessary. In this regard, the negotiations on military issues have taken the first step. However, this cannot be the end, and other steps must be taken. This is the purpose of the Soviet delegation's proposal. This proposal hopes to enable the French and Vietnamese Democratic Republic delegations to contact each other to discuss political issues between the two sides. Pham Van Dong said that the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agrees with this proposal, and now it depends on the attitude of France. In this way, while the representatives of both sides hold military meetings, political meetings of the same nature should also be held. The General Assembly should also alternately discuss military issues and political issues. This is the only way that is in line with the task entrusted to us by the conference—to solve all the problems that need to be solved in order to restore peace in Indochina as soon as possible.

　　The meeting resumed after a fifteen-minute break. Cambodian representative Tep Phan spoke first. He tried in vain to overturn the facts pointed out by Pham Van Dong in his speech that the Cambodian people are resisting French aggression and demanding freedom and independence, but he could not help but admit that there are French officers in the Cambodian army. From this alone, it can be seen what kind of "independence" the Cambodian representative claims to have obtained. He refused to discuss the political issues of Cambodia, attempting to continue to maintain French colonial rule in Cambodia.

　　Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke. (Full text issued separately)

　　Laotian representative Phoung Sananikone and Bao Dai representative Nguyen Quoc Dinh then spoke. They all tried to deny well-known facts, insisting that they had obtained "independence."

　　U.S. representative Smith then spoke. Smith still insisted that the resistance armies of Cambodia and Laos withdraw from their own countries, and declared that the issue of restoring peace in Vietnam does not include matters related to the so-called "sovereignty" and "independence" of the Bao Dai regime. In this way, he clearly expressed that the United States wants to continue to use Bao Dai to obstruct the solution of Vietnam's political problems. Smith also said that the U.S. delegation fully agrees with the statement made by the British representative today.

　　Since no one asked to speak, the chairman announced that a plenary session on the Korean issue will be held on the 11th. The time for the conference on the Indochina issue will be notified after consultation between the two chairmen. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.

    日内瓦会议十日继续讨论印度支那问题
    范文同代外长同意苏联的建议
    愿就讨论政治问题与法国方面进行接触
    据新华社日内瓦十日电：日内瓦会议十日继续举行讨论印度支那问题的全体会议。英国代表艾登担任主席。
    艾登首先以英国代表的身份发言。艾登说：两天公开的讨论已经澄清了双方的分歧，而且据他看来，还加深了这种分歧。
    艾登接着谈到英国代表团对三个主要问题的意见。首先，艾登说：大家都已同意了停止敌对行动应该是同时实现，并先研究在越南停止敌对行动的问题。艾登表示希望不久就能听到双方司令部代表会谈的结果。
    其次，艾登谈到停战监察问题。在中立国监察委员会的成员问题上，他重申了英国代表团所提的由印度、巴基斯坦、印尼、锡兰、缅甸五国组成中立国委员会的主张。他说：他相信，由四个国家组成一个机构，每两个国家支持一方的观点，只会造成“僵局”。艾登说：他拒绝这样做的理由不是思想意识方面的，而仅仅是因为“行不通”。然而，大家知道，监察朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会基本上是完成它的任务的。
    艾登认为：中立国监察委员会在不能得出协议时，应该以多数票作出决定，不能有否决权。艾登在这里否定了一致协议的原则，而这个原则是战后国际合作的一个重要保证。
    艾登说：他认为由交战双方组成的联合监督委员会可以在越南作出有益的工作。但是，他又说：这个委员会将会有分歧，而且可能经常有分歧。艾登说：正是在这里，国际委员会将起它的作用。他认为这个国际委员会总是会设法调解纠纷的。但是，他又认为在不能调解成功的时候，国际委员会应有权作出决定。
    艾登谈到的第三个问题是高棉和寮国问题。艾登重复早已被驳倒了的说法，诬蔑越南人民军“侵略”了高棉和寮国。然而，就连他自己也不能完全否认高棉和寮国人民抵抗运动的存在。
    艾登说：双方司令部代表的谈判正在进行。但是，他认为在停战监察的问题上和高棉、寮国的前途问题上，目前的分歧是“广泛而深刻”的。艾登说：除非能不迟延地缩小这种分歧，否则我们就不能完成我们的任务。我们已经想尽了我们所能想出的一切可行的程序办法来帮助我们的工作。我们没有别的选择，只有克服这些分歧或是承认失败。艾登表示：英国代表团仍愿试图在全体会议上或在有限制性会议上或以大家可能愿意采取的任何其他方式来克服这些分歧。但是，他又说，如果各方立场仍像今天这样，那么我们清楚的责任就是向世界说明这一点，并承认我们已经失败。
    大家知道两天来的公开讨论，充分证明：人为地造成目前分歧的责任在于西方国家。在这两天的讨论中，越南民主共和国、苏联和中国代表团为了推进会议的进展，都已提出了建设性的意见。如果对于恢复印度支那和平抱有诚意，西方国家就应该认真严肃地考虑这些意见。
    柬埔寨王国代表泰普潘接着发言。泰普潘在发言中照例对高棉民族解放运动和抗战政府大肆诬蔑。泰普潘还对印度、巴基斯坦等亚洲国家不承认他的政府表示不满。但是，他也不能不承认，这些国家之所以不承认柬埔寨王国政权是因为他们不相信这个政权已经“独立”。
    越南民主共和国代表范文同发言。范文同首先谈到高棉和寮国问题。他指出：柬埔寨王国和老挝王国代表对事实的荒谬绝伦的歪曲是欺骗不了任何人的。事实是：高棉和寮国人民紧密地团结起来已经并正在进行反对帝国主义侵略者的抗战。这个抗战包括了两国各阶层的人民，范围及于两个国家的整个领土。高棉人民以自己的行动热烈拥护越南民主共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上提出的建议。
    范文同也叙述了寮国和高棉人民抗战的历史，并叙述了高棉和寮国人民在抗战过程中所进行的经济建设和民主改革。
    范文同指出：所谓柬埔寨王国政府和老挝王国政府已从法国手中取得“独立”的说法是虚伪的。事实上，柬埔寨王国和老挝王国的内政、外交、军事、经济、财政、文化和教育都掌握在法国人的手里。在经济方面，一切比较重要的企业都掌握在法国人手中。在军事方面，这两个国家的伪军都是由法国驻印度支那军队总司令指挥的。
    在指出所谓越南人民军“侵略”了高棉和寮国的说法完全不符合事实以后，范文同说：为了恢复高棉和寮国的和平，必须考虑到事实真相。不能设想用所谓“越盟侵略”的说法就可以很容易地解决这个问题。高棉、寮国的民族解放运动是和越南以及其他国家的民族解放运动一样的。
    范文同接着谈到越南的统一问题。范文同指出：保大代表所谓的“统一”就是要把越南统一在保大一个人的下面。显然，这是否认人民权利和民主的最基本的概念并且是蔑视现实的。保大代表团所设想的“统一”就是要使帝国主义奴役全体越南人民。相反地，越南民主共和国却提出了一个实现越南统一的合理的切实可行的方案。根据这个方案，越南的统一必须根据人民的意志来实现。这个统一只能靠自由的、民主的和没有任何外国干涉的普选来实现。然而，为了要举行这个选举，先决条件是实现停战，实现停火并研究和划定双方集结地区。除此以外没有其他的办法。正因为如此，会议才同意了越南民主共和国在这方面所提出的建议。
    范文同指出：保大代表叫嚣反对分治。问题在于：他们不愿意举行自由的普选，他们害怕人民。范文同接着举出了许多法国和美国报纸的言论来说明保大在越南人民中没有任何威信和权威。范文同说：正因为如此，保大代表才提出了一个大家知道是荒谬的、不能接受的建议，其目的就是要阻挠会议的工作，阻挠恢复和平，继续和扩大战争，从而维持一个为外国服务的、剥削和压迫人民的政权。
    范文同接着谈到民族独立问题。范文同特别指出了保大和法国所签订的条约的虚伪性。范文同还引证法国军事顾问和将军们所说的保大军队士气低落的话，来说明越南人民完全不相信已经获得了独立。
    范文同说：根据以上所说，越南民主共和国代表团在五月十日提交会议的建议是有着特别的真正重要性的。
    一、首先应该承认越南及印度支那其他国家的独立原则，这应该是完全、真正、实际、无保留、不虚假的独立。法国应负其责任。
    二、法国承认印度支那三国的独立就牵涉到撤退占领三国的外国军队的原则问题。因为前者是后者的结果。如果像我们所建议的，印度支那国家在将来能与法国在平等互利基础之上建立友好关系，那么法国远征军还有什么用处呢？但是假如主张进行新的殖民战争的主战派要实现他们的企图的话，那么自然有一切理由来说法国远征军将遭到不可避免的失败。
    三、在停火之后，必须可以在六个月之内进行普选。这是讨论越南统一的根本的、广泛的、简单的基础，这种统一是全体越南人民及与我国友好的人民所最关心的。越南的统一是不可侵犯的原则。任何人也没有想到这是会成为问题的。所以我们向所有越南人建议：绝对不管他们的阶级、性别、政治及宗教信仰如何，和我们一起用目前情况所需要的唯一方法来实现我国的统一，这个方法就是举行自由与民主的选举。
    这些就是有关印度支那各国的主要问题，现在应该提到这些国家与法国的关系，尤其是经济与文化上的关系。愈来愈多的（法国）代表团来日内瓦访问我们，对于我们提议在平等与友谊的基础之上与法国建立经济与文化关系，表示他们的同情与支持。当他们听到我们谈到我国参加法兰西联邦的可能性时，他们深深地感动。
    在地区调整之后，就应该考虑到无论属于那一方面的支持者，他们的生命、财产、自由、安全及个人的民主权利都应得到保证。
    范文同指出：以上就是恢复印度支那和平的政治方面的一些主要问题，这就是我们会议上所要讨论的，也是我们实际生活中已经发生了的问题。
    范文同指出，为了在印度支那恢复和平，越南民主共和国代表团已提出公平、合理的建议。这个建议一方面会给越南人民和平、独立、统一和民主，
  一方面将使越南和法国人民建立友好关系。目前人人了解越南民主共和国的一切建议都是出于实事求是的精神，尊重双方的合法利益和明确的责任感。范文同说，希望法国代表团也采取这种态度和政策，言行要一致，而不是一边谈和平，一边在支持
  一个否定和平的政府和进行必然会走向冒险的谈判。难道这是有诚意和合乎逻辑吗？有人抱怨我们
  说了不动听的东西。挑剔字句是没有用的；事实必须负责。为了和平事业和人民间的了解，以上事实必须特别指出。
    范文同最后说：停火谈判正在进行，双方司令部代表已经在日内瓦接触。同样的接触也要在印度支那开始。这是令人鼓舞的事实。但是双方必须表示同样想达成协议的意志。日内瓦会议是为了寻求在印度支那和平，交战双方对问题最有关系，因此双方直接接触是必需的。在这方面，就军事问题的谈判已经走了第一步。不过不能到此为止而必须采取其他步骤。这就是苏联代表团建议的目的。这个建议希望使法国和越南民主共和国代表团就讨论双方之间的政治问题进行接触。范文同说，越南民主共和国代表团同意这个建议，现在要看法国的态度。这样双方代表举行军事会议的同时，也要举行同样性质的政治会议。大会也要轮流讨论军事问题和政治问题。这是符合会议委托我们的任务——解决一切为了尽速恢复印度支那和平所要解决的问题——的唯一办法。
    会议休息十五分钟后复会。柬埔寨代表泰普潘首先发言。他徒然地企图推翻范文同在发言中所指出的高棉人民抵抗法国侵略、要求自由独立的事实，可是他不能不承认，柬埔寨的军队中有着法国军官。仅从这一点也可以看出柬埔寨代表自称已经得到的“独立”是怎么一回事了。他拒绝讨论高棉的政治问题，企图继续保持法国在高棉的殖民统治。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接着发言。（全文另发）
    老挝王国代表冯·萨纳尼空和保大代表阮国定接着发言。他们都企图否认众所周知的事实，硬说已经获得了“独立”。
    美国代表史密斯接着发言。史密斯仍然坚持要高棉和寮国的抵抗军队撤出它们的本国，并且宣称在越南恢复和平的问题不包含与保大政权的所谓“主权”与“独立”有关的事情。这样他就明白地表示美国要继续利用保大阻挠越南的政治问题的解决。史密斯并说，美国代表团完全同意英国代表今天所作的发言。
    由于没有人要求发言，主席宣布：十一日将举行关于朝鲜问题的全体会议。关于印度支那问题的会议何时召开由两位主席商定后再行通知。会议于下午七时休会。
