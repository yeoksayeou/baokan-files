    French National Assembly Vote of No Confidence Results
    Laniel Cabinet Suffers Defeat
    [Xinhua News Agency, June 13th] Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly conducted a vote of no confidence on the Laniel cabinet on the 12th. The results of the vote were 306 against, 293 in favor, resulting in the defeat of the Laniel cabinet.
    The Laniel cabinet has already submitted its resignation to French President Coty.
    The results of the National Assembly vote reflect the strong dissatisfaction of broad segments of the French people with the Laniel cabinet's Indochina policy. Laniel requested the vote of confidence after the National Assembly's debate on the Indochina issue on the 8th and 9th. During the parliamentary debates, many members of various parties criticized the Laniel cabinet, especially Foreign Minister Bidault, for following the United States' attitude at the Geneva Conference. The members expressed their opposition to continuing the war and demanded the realization of peace in Indochina.
