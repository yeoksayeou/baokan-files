Kunyushan Forest Farm in Shandong Province

    Eliminates Over 3 Million Jin of Pine Caterpillar

    Kunyushan Forest Farm in Shandong Province has achieved remarkable results using medicated powder to eradicate pine caterpillars. The farm has over 40,000 mu of red pine forest. Since the outbreak of insect pests in 1951, although the masses have been continuously mobilized for manual capture, it has not been possible to stop the spread of the pests. This year, the farm formulated a prevention and control work plan for pine caterpillars very early on, prepared a large quantity of "666" medicated powder, and organized five insect-catching teams. In late April, they went to various forest areas to spray the medicine. After more than 50 days of medicinal treatment, approximately 3 million jin of pine caterpillars were poisoned and killed, and the prevention and control area reached more than 18,000 mu, basically eliminating the pine caterpillar infestation. This has also motivated farmers in five nearby townships to carry out medicated killing of pine caterpillars. (Lü Baochen, Sun Yujia)

    山东省崐崳山林场
    消灭松毛虫三百多万斤
    山东省崐崳山林场用药粉扑灭松毛虫，已获得显著成绩。该场有赤松林四万余亩，自一九五一年发生虫害以来，虽经连续发动群众进行人工捕捉，但仍未能制止虫害的蔓延。今年该场很早就制订了防治松毛虫工作计划，并准备了大批的“六六六”药粉，组织了五个捕虫队，于四月下旬，分赴各林区进行喷药。经过五十多天的药治，毒死松毛虫约三百多万斤，防治面积达一万八千余亩，基本上已经消灭了松毛虫害。并且还带动了附近五个乡的农民开展药杀松毛虫工作。（吕宝琛　孙渔稼）
