Report on the Draft National Budget for 1954 (Abstract)
Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government Deng Xiaoping

After listening to and discussing the report on the draft national budget for 1954 by Deng Xiaoping, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, the 31st meeting of the Central People's Government Committee approved the national budget for 1954.

Deng Xiaoping first explained that the draft national budget for 1954 was prepared based on the general task of the state during the transition period and on the basis of the successful completion of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan for national economic construction. This draft budget is adapted to the requirements of national economic development in 1954. He then reported on the execution of the 1953 national budget and the 1954 draft budget.

The following is a summary of the draft budget report:

Execution of the 1953 National Budget

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and thanks to the joint efforts of all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, and governments at all levels, economic organs, financial organs, and trade unions, as well as the soaring enthusiasm and creativity of the working people of the whole country, and the multifaceted assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, the national economic plan and national budget for 1953 have achieved tremendous success.

In 1953, the total value of national industrial and agricultural production increased by 11.4 percent compared to 1952 at constant prices in 1952 (estimated, same below). Of the total industrial and agricultural output value, modern industry accounted for 31.6 percent (28 in 1952), workshop handicrafts accounted for 7.8 percent, individual handicrafts accounted for 6.2 percent, and agricultural and sideline production accounted for 54.4 percent. The proportion of modern industry in the national economy has obviously increased, which means that we have taken another step towards socialist industrialization.

1953 was the first year of our country's large-scale economic construction. The speed of national economic development during the construction period cannot, of course, be the same as during the recovery period, but even so, the total industrial output value in 1953 still increased by 28 percent compared to 1952. Among them, the output value of state-owned industries increased by 33.7 percent, the output value of cooperative industries increased by 46.5 percent, the output value of joint state-private industries increased by 39 percent, and the output value of private industries increased by 18.5 percent. The main products of state-owned industries, especially heavy industrial products that develop the foundation of the national economy, mostly overfulfilled the plan: pig iron completed 102.4 percent of the plan, steel completed 107.4 percent of the plan, coal completed 111.6 percent of the plan, power generation completed 103.1 percent of the plan, and crude oil completed 109.7 percent of the plan. The production of daily consumer goods generally also completed or exceeded the plan.

A total of 173 major projects were started or continued construction in economic construction in 1953, and a total of 107 industrial construction projects with limits above the quota (i.e., light industry investment above 30 billion, heavy industry investment above 50 billion to 100 billion) were completed, among which many major projects such as Anshan Iron and Steel's large rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, and the seventh and eighth blast furnaces were completed in 1953 and have begun to be put into production.

In agriculture, 1953 was a year with relatively serious natural disasters since the national liberation. Therefore, agricultural production did not reach the original plan, but the total output value still increased by 1.5 percent compared to 1952. The correct way to develop the agricultural economy is to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. What is particularly important at present is to develop cooperation and mutual assistance. In the past year, great achievements have also been made in this regard. As of October 1953, the number of farmers organized in agricultural production mutual aid teams and cooperatives had reached 43 percent of the total number of farmers in the country, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives reached 14,192.

In terms of transportation: 589 kilometers of new railway lines were laid, close to the original plan. The total railway freight volume increased by 19.9 percent compared to 1952, and the total passenger volume increased by 36.8 percent. Transportation and postal and telecommunications all overfulfilled the plan.

In terms of domestic trade, the total retail sales of commodities in 1953 increased by about 20 percent compared to 1952, of which the retail sales of state-owned commercial enterprises increased by 56.6 percent compared to 1952. In order to ensure the needs for grain after the people's living standards have increased day by day, the planned purchase and supply of grain began in the winter of 1953, and this work has achieved remarkable results. This is a major victory on the national grain front, especially in promoting the advance of agricultural socialist transformation.

With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in labor productivity, the people's cultural and material lives have also been further improved, which fully reflects the care of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the people's lives. In 1953, the enrollment plan for universities and colleges was completed by 109.3 percent, the enrollment plan for senior high schools was completed by 113.6 percent, the enrollment plan for secondary normal schools was completed by 104 percent, and the enrollment plan for junior high schools was completed by 128 percent. The number of hospital beds in national hospitals under the Ministry of Health increased by 25,000 compared to 1952. Other cultural and scientific aspects have also developed accordingly. In terms of people's income, the average actual wage of employees in various departments of the state-owned economy in 1953 increased by more than 5 percent compared to 1952. Due to the increase in the wages of employees, the income of farmers, and the profits of industrialists and businessmen, the expansion of employment, and the large increase in national economic construction investment, social purchasing power increased by about 20 percent compared to 1952.

The above figures show that the tasks stipulated in the national economic plan for the first year of my country's first Five-Year Plan, except for agriculture due to natural disasters and four kinds of products in industry such as sacks, salt, flour, and sugar due to climate, raw materials, and other reasons, the rest have overfulfilled the plan. The proportion of socialist and semi-socialist economy has increased considerably. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has advanced to varying degrees. The people's material and cultural life has also been further improved on the basis of production development. This shows that the national plan is correct and fully meets the requirements of the general line and the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country.

On the basis of the above-mentioned national economic development, the execution of the 1953 national budget was good. According to the received final accounts and estimated figures, in terms of budget revenue, not counting the 41,232.2 billion yuan surplus in 1952, the total revenue in 1953 was 2,154,774 billion yuan, completing 105.92 percent of the original budget. In terms of expenditure, the total expenditure was 2,138,826 billion yuan, accounting for 91.60 percent of the original budget.

As a result of the execution of the 1953 budget, the expenditure on economic construction, social culture and education, and administrative management was less than the original budget. This is because some figures in these projects were originally over-budgeted; and more importantly, while fully ensuring all necessary expenses, we paid attention to saving all possible expenses. The national defense expenditure item in 1953 increased compared to the original budget. This was mainly because the United States attempted to actively expand the Korean War in the first half of 1953. In order to cope with various possible situations, we had to take some effective measures in national defense.

The above revenue and expenditure figures show that the execution of the 1953 national budget obviously achieved results. It not only guaranteed the necessary funds for the country in economic, cultural, educational, and national defense construction, but also, due to over-revenue and reduced expenditure, not only did not use the surplus from 1952, but also had a surplus in the current year's revenue and expenditure. By the end of 1953, we still had a surplus of 428,270 billion yuan, which enriched the state's credit funds, consolidated monetary credit, increased the financial turnover funds, and enhanced the financial reserve strength.

However, there are still many errors and shortcomings in the financial work in 1953. The changes to several tax systems at the beginning of 1953 were a principled error. The management of local finances also had the shortcoming of not paying attention to adapting to local conditions. When preparing the budget, due to lack of experience, all the previous year's surplus was included in the budget and invested in the same year, which once put the state's credit and financial quarterly turnover in a difficult state. The investment in some aspects was not rationally stipulated when formulating the budget, which also contributed to the tendency of blindly advancing divorced from reality. In terms of income, the planned industrial and commercial tax and enterprise income were somewhat conservative, which also affected the accuracy of the national budget. These errors and shortcomings were quickly changed due to the important instructions issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a series of effective measures taken in the work, and the result of the budget execution was good. However, we must deeply remember the experience and lessons in the preparation and execution of the 1953 budget to improve future work.

National Budget for 1954

The task of the 1954 national budget is to increase income, accumulate funds, and ensure the country's needs for the second year of the first Five-Year Plan, first of all the needs of industrial construction, and continue to strengthen national defense forces, and further improve the material and cultural lives of the working people on the basis of developing production, through a series of measures such as increasing production, expanding material exchanges, increasing labor productivity, reducing costs, vigorously practicing thrift, and correctly executing tax revenue plans and tax policies. In order to achieve this task, the national budget must be established on a reliable and stable basis, adhere to the principle of balancing revenue and expenditure, and strive to achieve more revenue than expenditure and maintain considerable reserve strength.

The 1954 national budget stipulates that the total revenue is 2,747,086 billion yuan, of which the actual total revenue for the current year is 2,318,816 billion yuan, and the surplus carried over from the previous year is 428,270 billion yuan. The total expenditure is 2,494,578 billion yuan, of which 175,762 billion yuan is used from the surplus of the previous year. The surplus of 252,508 billion yuan in the total revenue of the current year will be used as the surplus of the current year, all of which will be used as the state's credit funds and the financial quarterly difference turnover funds. The revenue and expenditure of the national budget are based on a reliable basis, so it is a healthy budget.

Source of Budget Revenue

Among the budget revenue, industrial and commercial taxes totaled 1,044,551 billion yuan, accounting for 45.05 percent of the total revenue, an increase of 12.9 percent compared to 1953. The amount of agricultural tax collected will remain at the 1952 level.

The income of state-owned enterprises totaled 833,418 billion yuan, accounting for 35.94 percent of the total revenue, an increase of 10.46 percent compared to 1953. If the incomparable factors are removed, it will increase by 16.58 percent compared to 1953.

As of the end of April, the 1954 National Economic Construction Public Bonds have been subscribed to 81,600 billion yuan, exceeding the estimate by 36 percent. This is also a component of the national budget revenue, which shows the active support of the Chinese people for national economic construction and the full trust in the People's Government.

In the 1954 national budget revenue, the income from socialist enterprises continues to occupy the first place. The proportion of state-owned economic contributions has increased from 62.60 percent in 1953 to 63.58 percent. The proportion of cooperative economic contributions has increased from 2.48 percent to 2.56 percent; the proportion of joint state-private economic contributions has increased from 1.23 percent to 2.93 percent. The total of the above three items has increased from 66.31 percent to 69.07 percent. Since the People's Government resolutely implemented the measures to stabilize the burden on farmers within three years, although farmers' income has increased rapidly in recent years, their burden has not increased. The proportion of agricultural tax in the budget in 1954 has decreased from 13.48 percent to 13.43 percent. The proportion of private industrial and commercial tax in the budget has also decreased from 17.02 percent to 15.4 percent. The allocation of national financial income sources in 1954 is in line with the further development of my country's national economy, the growth of socialist economic components, and the actual situation of changes in the proportion of public and private economies.

Allocation of Budget Expenditure

Our national budget is a budget for constructive, peaceful development of the economy. The vast majority of budget funds are used in the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, joint state-private enterprises, and social, cultural and educational undertakings. The distribution is as follows:

The appropriation for economic construction is 1,132,270 billion yuan, accounting for 45.39 percent of the total national budget expenditure, an increase of 31.63 percent compared to 1953. The huge investment in economic construction will further promote the development of the national economy. According to the national plan, the total value of my country's industrial and agricultural output in 1954 will increase by 12.6 percent compared to the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1953.

The focus of national economic construction is to develop industry, especially heavy industry. Therefore, the national budget allocated 541,218 billion yuan to the industrial sector, accounting for 47.8 percent of the economic construction expenditure; an increase of 26.27 percent compared to the funds allocated to the industrial sector in 1953. Among the industrial appropriations, the appropriations for heavy industries such as coal, electricity, petroleum, steel, chemical industry, and machinery manufacturing account for 78.3 percent, and light industry accounts for 21.7 percent. These appropriations not only ensure the funds needed for the basic construction plan centered on the 141 construction projects in the current year, but also ensure the development of industrial production in the current year. The output value of modern industry in 1954 will increase by 18.3 percent compared to the output value of modern industry in 1953. Among the several major products of the central industrial departments, comparing 1954 and 1953, pig iron will increase by 31.1 percent, steel will increase by 18.8 percent, power generation will increase by 14.9 percent, cotton yarn will increase by 6.2 percent, paper will increase by 14 percent, sugar will increase by 23.2 percent, and cigarettes will increase by 16.6 percent.

The national economic development plan and budget also stipulate that agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy should be further developed this year to adapt to the development of industry. The appropriation in this regard for the current year is 119,429 billion yuan, accounting for 10.55 percent of the economic construction expenditure; an increase of 5.53 percent compared to the appropriation in this regard in 1953. In 1954, it is required that the output of grain and cotton continue to increase, 54 more state-owned mechanized farms should be added, and the number of farmers organized to participate in mutual assistance and cooperation will reach about 59 percent of the total number of farmers in the country, and more than 80,000 agricultural production cooperatives will be added.

In 1954, it is also required to further expand commodity circulation to meet national construction and people's needs. The appropriation for the commercial sector, the foreign trade sector, and the grain sector for the current year is 127,907 billion yuan, accounting for 11.29 percent of the economic construction expenditure; an increase of 28.05 percent compared to the appropriation in this regard in 1953. The total retail sales of commodities in the country in 1954 will increase by 13.8 percent compared to the total retail sales of commodities in the country in 1953, of which the total retail sales of state-owned commercial enterprises will increase by 8.2 percent compared to 1953, and the total retail sales of cooperative commercial enterprises will increase by 35 percent compared to 1953. The total retail sales of private commercial enterprises in the country will also increase.

In order to steadily expand the state capitalist economy of joint state-private operation, the state's investment in joint state-private enterprises from all aspects is 25,000 billion yuan.

Due to the increase in production and the expansion of commodity circulation, railways, transportation, postal and telecommunications and other undertakings should also be developed accordingly. The appropriation in this regard for the current year is 176,493 billion yuan, accounting for 15.59 percent of the economic construction expenditure; an increase of 42.09 percent compared to the appropriation in this regard in 1953. In 1954, 603 kilometers of new railway lines will be laid, the total freight volume will increase by 15.5 percent compared to 1953, and the total passenger volume will increase by 14 percent compared to 1953. The inland waterway freight volume will increase by 26.6 percent compared to 1953, and the sea freight volume will increase by 44 percent compared to 1953.

The national budget for 1954 not only reflects the development of the national economy and the strengthening of socialist economic factors, but also reflects the state's concern for culture, education, science, health, and social welfare.

The national budget for 1954 allocates 366,920 billion yuan to social, cultural, education, science, and health (social labor insurance costs are not included), accounting for 14.71 percent of the total national budget expenditure, an increase of 15.2 percent compared to the appropriation in this regard in 1953. Among them, 279,048 billion yuan is used for culture, education, and health expenditure; 46,578 billion yuan is used for social relief and preferential treatment expenditure. In 1954, universities and colleges plan to enroll 90,505 people, an increase of 13,988 people compared to 1953. Secondary technical schools and worker-peasant short-term middle schools will enroll 127,130 people, an increase of 24,535 people compared to 1953. Ordinary middle schools, including senior and junior high schools, will enroll a total of 1,349,650 people, an increase of 353,476 people compared to 1953. The number of hospital beds in national hospitals under the Ministry of Health will reach 207,533, an increase of 16,468 compared to 1953.

On the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity (the 1954 regulations stipulate that state-owned industries should increase labor productivity by 13.2 percent), the average wages of employees of state-owned enterprises, cultural and educational departments, and state organs across the country will increase by 5.2 percent compared to 1953. Social purchasing power will increase by 13.8 percent compared to 1953, and the living standards of the working people will be further improved.

While our country is vigorously carrying out economic construction, we must pay attention to strengthening national defense forces, which is an important factor in ensuring our peaceful construction. Although our country has consistently pursued a policy of peaceful construction since the day it was founded, we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against the war policy of the warmongering elements of US imperialism and their hostile actions against our country. Therefore, the national defense expenditure stipulated in the 1954 national budget is still listed at 526,700 billion yuan, accounting for 21.11 percent of the total expenditure, which is completely necessary.

Arrangement of Local Budgets

In the 1954 national budget, a more appropriate arrangement has also been made for local budgets. In financial management, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of decentralized management under the unified leadership and planning of the central government.

The total amount of local budget expenditure in various provinces (cities) in 1954 is 596,462 billion yuan, accounting for 23.91 percent of the national budget, an increase of 14.9 percent compared to the total amount of local budget expenditure in 1953, of which local economic construction expenditure accounts for 23.86 percent of the local budget; social and cultural expenditure accounts for 40.64 percent of the local budget; administrative management expenditure accounts for 29.16 percent of the local budget. In 1954, the total output value of local state-owned industries will increase by 31.3 percent compared to the total output value of local state-owned industries in 1953.

Whether the execution of local budgets is stable or not is one of the important factors related to the balance of revenue and expenditure of the national budget. Governments at all levels should strictly control the execution of the budget. The general reserve fund and cross-year expenses should stipulate the method of use and strictly review them. The surplus of the previous year should be used as much as possible to increase working capital or supplement the working capital of local state-owned enterprises to strengthen the reserve strength of local budgets.

Strive to Increase Production, Practice Thrift, and Successfully Complete the 1954 Budget

The allocation ratio of national budget revenue and expenditure in 1954 fully illustrates the superiority of my country's people's democratic state system. The preparation of the 1954 national budget is also more advanced than in 1953. The listed revenue and expenditure are more in line with reality, and attention has been paid to combining with the national credit plan, which makes the national budget have a more reliable foundation. But we must not therefore hold an attitude of everything is fine; we must continue to work hard to increase revenue and save expenditure in the process of executing the budget, and strive for the result of the 1954 budget execution, not only not to use the surplus of the previous year, but also to obtain more surplus, in order to further enhance the national financial reserve strength. Chairman Mao instructed us: "Increasing production, practicing thrift, and leaving more reserve strength are three reliable lines of defense for consolidating the national budget," which is the policy we must earnestly implement in financial work.

In order to ensure the realization of the 1954 national budget, the following tasks must be completed:

First, fully complete and over fulfill the 1954 national economic plan. This is the basis for ensuring the successful realization of the 1954 national budget. Governments at all levels and all enterprise units must fully mobilize the broad masses of employees and people, continue to implement the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, and strive to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. The cost reduction indicators for various departments are: state-owned and local state-owned industries reduce by 5.2 percent, railway transportation reduces by 5.3 percent, construction and installation costs in basic construction should strive to reduce by 8 percent, and the circulation cost rate of state-owned commercial trade should be reduced by 13.7 percent. Completing the cost reduction plan can accumulate huge amounts of funds for the country.

Strengthening the financial management of enterprises is an important task to ensure the completion of the above plan. Although the preparation and execution of the financial plan of state-owned enterprises in 1953 has made a big step forward compared to previous years, except for individual departments, the profit and basic depreciation payment of most departments exceeded the plan. However, there are still serious shortcomings in this work. Generally, the production plan, especially the enterprise income plan, is set too low, and the potential is not fully explored. For example, the enterprise income plans of domestic commerce and railway transportation are set too low, so the execution results exceed a lot. The payment of profits and basic depreciation funds is mostly not timely and loose in the front and tight in the back, and some even occupy the payable funds for a long time. The key construction is not tightly grasped, the use of investment is still scattered, the project budget and project cost are generally too high, the use of wide and narrow, and the backlog of materials and other situations are still serious. Some construction and installation projects have experienced serious idleness in the early stage of 1953 due to insufficient design strength and poor construction preparation. There are also phenomena of rework and reconstruction of completed projects due to substandard quality. This has caused a waste of national funds.

In order to overcome these shortcomings, party committees, governments, economic organs, and enterprise units at all levels must strictly abide by the thrift system, resolutely fight against waste; must pay attention to finding tricks, tapping potential, strengthening technical measures, improving labor organization, increasing labor productivity, and correctly formulate reasonable production quotas and technical quotas; strengthen the management of raw materials and materials, strengthen the warehouse management of various economic departments, cherish machines, strengthen maintenance and repair and safety measures; accelerate the turnover of funds, reduce the standard of miscellaneous expenses, and pay profits in a timely and sufficient amount.

Second, complete various tax revenues. This is the key to the smooth realization of the national budget. Therefore, it is necessary to earnestly implement tax policies, seize income, and further improve collection and management work. On the one hand, we must strengthen the ideological education of patriotism, law-abiding, and tax payment for industrial and commercial households, and on the other hand, we must continue to fight seriously against tax evasion and tax evasion. The agricultural tax work must continue to implement the various principles stipulated in the instructions on agricultural tax work issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government in June 1953, and further implement the burden policy of fairness, rationality, and encouraging increased production.

Third, reduce the expenses of state organs and streamline state administrative institutions. This is an important method for the state to accumulate industrialization funds. In the past, in terms of economic construction undertakings and cultural and educational undertakings, there were still unreasonable phenomena in fixed personnel and quotas. It is necessary to formulate establishment quotas and necessary physical use standards and financial expenditure standards that are both practical and in line with the principle of thrift from bottom to top, and approve and verify them at each level as the basis for calculating the budget, allocating funds, and implementing financial supervision.

In state organs, there are still large institutions, many levels, and redundant personnel. Some departments or units still have extravagance and waste in their expenses. It is necessary to effectively streamline institutions, appropriately reduce the number of personnel, so as to improve work efficiency and reduce the expenses of administrative organs. The establishment of state organs should adhere to the regulations that no personnel shall be increased without the approval of the Central Establishment Committee.

Fourth, strengthen financial supervision and strictly enforce financial discipline. Financial supervision is an important method to help enterprises, business departments, and administrative organs improve organizational management, implement economic accounting, and implement a strict thrift system. At present, this work is still very weak, and the inspection is not in-depth. The financial department must be determined to correct bureaucracy and red tape, and list financial supervision as one of the important tasks of this year's financial work, and conduct on-site inspections of certain departments and regions with emphasis: for enterprise departments, check whether their cost reduction plan, financial plan, and profit depreciation payment plan are completed, whether there is a backlog of raw materials and funds, and whether non-production expenses are too large; for basic construction units, check whether their project costs are too high, whether the funds are used according to plan, and how effective the use is; for cultural and educational institutions, check whether their fixed personnel and quotas are reasonable, and whether the business plan is consistent with the financial plan; for administrative organs, check whether they are reducing their establishments and streamlining their personnel in accordance with the central government's regulations, and whether there are phenomena of large institutions and overstaffing.

Fifth, financial organ personnel must improve their political and professional level, combine politics and business, combine theory and practice, carry out criticism and self-criticism, oppose the emotion of pride and complacency, and fulfill their due responsibilities in the execution of financial discipline. It is necessary to recognize that financial work is a comprehensive political work that relates to all aspects. It must obey the leadership of the party and the government, rely on the support of the broad masses of the people, and obtain the cooperation and assistance of other departments to do a good job. The strengthening of the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels over financial work, frequent care and inspection of their work, is always the guarantee for us to complete the task of financial work.

We believe that as long as we can implement the above requirements in our work, then there is no doubt that the smooth realization of the 1954 national budget will be achieved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告（摘要）
    中央人民政府财政部部长　邓小平
    中央人民政府委员会第三十一次会议在听取和讨论了中央人民政府政务院副总理兼财政部部长邓小平关于一九五四年国家预算草案的报告之后，批准了一九五四年的国家预算。
    邓小平首先说明了一九五四年国家预算草案是依据国家在过渡时期的总任务，在第一个五年建设计划第一年度国民经济计划胜利完成的基础上编制的。这个预算草案是与一九五四年国民经济发展的要求相适应的。他接着就一九五三年国家预算执行情况和一九五四年预算草案作了报告。
    预算草案报告摘要如下：
    一九五三年国家预算执行情况
    一九五三年的国民经济计划和国家预算，在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，由于各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体和各级人民政府、各经济机关、财政机关、职工会的共同努力，由于全国劳动人民劳动积极性、创造性的高涨，以及我国伟大友邦苏联的多方援助，已取得巨大的成就。
    一九五三年全国工农业生产总值，按一九五二年不变价格计算，比一九五二年增长了百分之一一点四（预计数，下同）。工农业总产值中，现代工业占百分之三一点六（一九五二年为二八），工场手工业占百分之七点八，个体手工业占百分之六点二，农副业占百分之五四点四。现代工业在国民经济中的比重，显然是增加了，这意味着我们向社会主义工业化又迈进了一步。
    一九五三年是我国开始大规模经济建设的第一年，建设时期国民经济发展的速度，当然不能与恢复时期一样，但是即使如此，一九五三年工业总产值仍比一九五二年增长百分之二八。其中国营工业产值增长百分之三三点七，合作社营工业产值增长四六点五，公私合营工业产值增长三九，私营工业产值增长一八点五。国营工业中的主要产品，特别是发展国民经济基础的重工业产品，大部超额完成了计划：生铁完成计划的百分之一○二点四，钢完成计划的百分之一○七点四，煤完成计划的百分之一一一点六，发电量完成计划的百分之一○三点一，原油完成计划的百分之一○九点七。日用消费品的生产，一般也都完成或超额完成了计划。
    一九五三年经济建设中开始施工或继续施工的重大项目共一七三项，工业建设限额以上的项目（即轻工业投资在三百亿以上的项目，重工业投资在五百亿到一千亿以上的项目）共一○七项，其中有不少重大项目如鞍钢的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七和第八号炼铁炉等，已在一九五三年建设完成，并已开始投入生产。
    农业方面，一九五三年是全国解放以来自然灾害比较严重的一年，因此农业生产没有达到原定的计划，但总产值仍比一九五二年增长百分之一点五。发展农业经济的正确道路，就是实现农业的社会主义改造，目前特别重要的就是发展合作互助。过去一年中，在这方面也取得了很大的成绩，组织在农业生产互助组和合作社中的农户，截至一九五三年十月的统计，已达全国农户总数的百分之四三，农业生产合作社达到一四、一九二个。
    交通运输方面：铁道新线铺轨五八九公里，接近原订计划，铁道货运总量比一九五二年增长百分之一九点九，客运总量增长百分之三六点八。交通、邮电均超额完成了计划。
    国内贸易方面，一九五三年的商品零售总额比一九五二年增长百分之二○左右，其中国营商业的零售额比一九五二年增长百分之五六点六。为了保证人民生活水平日益增长后对粮食的需要，一九五三年冬季开始实行了粮食的计划收购和计划供应，这项工作已收到显著的成效。这在国家的粮食战线上，尤其在推动农业社会主义改造的前进上，是一个重大的胜利。
    随着工农业生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，人民的文化与物质生活也进一步提高了，这充分反映了中国共产党和人民政府对人民生活的关怀。一九五三年高等学校招生计划完成百分之一○九点三，高级中学招生计划完成百分之一一三点六，中等师范学校招生计划完成百分之一○四，初级中学招生计划完成百分之一二八。卫生部所属全国医院病床比一九五二年增加二五、○○○张。其他文化科学方面亦均有相应的发展。在人民的收入方面，一九五三年国营经济各部门职工全年平均实际工资比一九五二年增长百分之五以上。由于职工工资、农民收入与工商业者的利润均有增加，就业人数扩大，以及国家经济建设投资大量增长等因素，社会购买力比一九五二年约提高百分之二○左右。
    上述数字表明，我国第一个五年建设计划第一年度的国民经济计划所规定的各项任务，除农业因有自然灾害和工业中的麻袋、盐、面粉、糖等四种产品因气候、原料等原因没有完成计划外，其余都已超额完成了计划。社会主义和半社会主义经济的比重，有相当大的增加。对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，都在不同程度上前进了一步。人民的物质和文化生活，也在生产发展的基础上有了进一步的改善。这就说明国家的计划是正确的，是完全符合总路线的要求和全国人民的根本利益的。
    在上述国民经济发展的基础上，一九五三年国家预算的执行情况是良好的。根据已收到的决算和预计数字来看，预算收入方面，不算一九五二年结余四一二、三二二亿元，一九五三年本年总收入共完成二、一五四、七七四亿元，完成原预算的百分之一○五点九二。支出方面，总支出共计二、一三八、八二六亿元，为原预算的百分之九一点六○。
    一九五三年预算执行的结果，经济建设费、社会文教费和行政管理费的支出，比原预算为少。这是因为这些项目中，某些数字原来编列过大；而更重要的是，我们在充分保证一切必需费用的同时，注意了节省一切可以节省的开支。一九五三年的国防开支项目，比原预算有所增加，这主要是因为一九五三年上半年美国图谋积极扩大朝鲜战争，为了应付各种可能发生的情况，我们必须在国防上采取一些有效的措施的原故。
    上述收支数字表明，一九五三年国家预算执行的结果，显然是有成绩的，既保证了国家在经济、文化教育和国防建设各方面必需的资金，又由于收入超过，支出节减，不仅没有动用一九五二年的结余，而且本年收支相抵尚有结余。到一九五三年年终为止，我们尚有结余四二八、二七○亿元，这就给国家充实了信贷资金，巩固了货币信用，增加了财政的周转资金，增强了财政后备力量。
    但是，一九五三年的财政工作还有不少错误和缺点。一九五三年年初对若干税收制度的改变，是犯了带原则性的错误的。对地方财政的管理，也有未注意因地制宜的缺点。在编制预算时，由于经验不足，把上年结余全部列入预算，并且作了当年的投资，因而使国家信贷和财政季度周转一度处于困难的状态；在某些方面的投资在制定预算时规定得不尽合理，也助长了脱离实际的盲目冒进倾向。在收入方面，工商税和企业收入计划订得有些保守，这也影响到国家预算的准确性。这些错误和缺点，由于中国共产党中央发出了重要的指示和在工作中采取了一系列的有效措施而迅速地获得了改变，预算执行的结果是良好的。但是，我们必须深刻记取一九五三年预算编制和执行中的经验教训，用来改进今后的工作。
    一九五四年国家预算
    一九五四年国家预算的任务，就是要从增加生产、扩大物资交流、提高劳动生产率、降低成本、厉行节约和正确地执行税收计划和税收政策等一系列的措施中，增加收入，积累资金，保证我国第一个五年建设计划第二个年度的国家需要，首先是工业建设的需要，并继续加强国防力量，和在发展生产的基础上进一步改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活。为了实现这个任务，就必须将国家预算建立在可靠的、稳妥的基础上，坚持收支平衡的原则，并力求达到收多于支和保持相当的后备力量。
    一九五四年国家预算规定总计收入为二、七四七、○八六亿元，其中本年实际总收入二、三一八、八一六亿元，结转上年结余四二八、二七○亿元。总支出为二、四九四、五七八亿元，其中使用上年结余一七五、七六二亿元。本年总计收入中所多余的二五二、五○八亿元，作为本年结余，全部充作国家信贷资金和财政的季度差额周转资金。国家预算的收支都是建立在可靠的基础之上的，因此它是一个健康的预算。
    预算收入的来源
    预算收入中，工商各税共列一、○四四、五五一亿元，占总收入的百分之四五点○五，比一九五三年增长百分之一二点九。农业税征收量仍维持一九五二年的水平。
    国营企业收入共列八三三、四一八亿元，占总收入的百分之三五点九四，比一九五三年增长百分之一○点四六，如果除去不可比的因素，则比一九五三年增长百分之一六点五八。
    一九五四年国家经济建设公债，到四月底止已认购了八一、六○○亿元，超过预计百分之三六。这也是国家预算收入的一个组成部分，它表明了我国人民对国家经济建设的积极支持和对人民政府的充分信任。
    一九五四年国家预算的收入中，来自社会主义性质的企业收入继续占居首位。国营经济缴纳所占的比重，已由一九五三年的百分之六二点六○，增长到百分之六三点五八。合作社经济缴纳所占的比重，由百分之二点四八，增长到百分之二点五六；公私合营经济缴纳所占的比重，由百分之一点二三，增长到百分之二点九三。上三项合计起来，已由占百分之六六点三一增长到占百分之六九点○七。由于人民政府坚决贯彻在三年内稳定农民负担的措施，近年来农民收入虽然增加较快，但其负担仍未增加，一九五四年农业税在预算中的比重由百分之一三点四八，降到百分之一三点四三。私营工商业税在预算中的比重，也由百分之一七点○二，降到百分之一五点四。一九五四年国家财政收入来源的分配，是与我国国民经济进一步的发展，社会主义经济成份的增长和公私经济比重变化的实际情况相符合的。
    预算支出的分配
    我们的国家预算是建设性的和平发展经济的预算。预算资金的绝大部分，是用在发展工业、农业、交通运输业、商业、公私合营企业和社会文化教育事业方面。其分配情况如下：
    用于经济建设的拨款为一、一三二、二七○亿元，占国家预算总支出的百分之四五点三九，比一九五三年增长百分之三一点六三。对经济建设的巨大投资，将进一步促进国民经济的发展。根据国家的计划，一九五四年我国工农业的总产值，将比一九五三年的工农业总产值增长百分之一二点六。
    国民经济建设的重点是发展工业，特别是发展重工业。因而国家预算拨给工业部门的资金为五四一、二一八亿元，占经济建设费的百分之四七点八；比一九五三年拨给工业部门的资金增长百分之二六点二七。在工业拨款中，煤炭、电力、石油、钢铁、化学、机械制造等重工业的拨款又占百分之七八点三，轻工业占百分之二一点七。这些拨款，不但保证了以一四一项建设工程为中心的基本建设计划在本年度需要的资金，也保证了本年度工业生产的发展。一九五四年的现代工业产值将比一九五三年的现代工业产值增长百分之一八点三。在中央各工业部的几种主要产品中，一九五四年和一九五三年比较，生铁将增长百分之三一点一，钢增长百分之一八点八，发电量增长百分之一四点九，棉纱增长百分之六点二，纸增长百分之一四，糖增长百分之二三点二，卷烟增长百分之一六点六。
    国民经济发展计划和预算也规定了本年要进一步发展农业、林业、水利事业，使之和工业的发展相适应。本年度在这方面的拨款为一一九、四二九亿元，占经济建设费用的百分之一○点五五；比一九五三年在这方面的拨款增长百分之五点五三。一九五四年要求粮食棉花产量继续提高，国营机械化农场增加五十四个，组织起来参加互助合作的农户将达全国农户总数的百分之五九左右，农业生产合作社增加八万余个。
    在一九五四年，也要求进一步扩大商品流转，以适应国家建设和人民需要。本年度给商业部门、对外贸易部门和粮食部门的拨款为一二七、九○七亿元，占经济建设费用的百分之一一点二九，比一九五三年在这方面的拨款增长百分之二八点○五。一九五四年全国商品零售总额将比一九五三年的全国商品零售总额增长百分之一三点八，其中国营商业的零售总额将比一九五三年增长百分之八点二，合作社商业的零售总额将比一九五三年增长百分之三五。全国私营商业的零售总额也将有所增加。
    为了稳步地扩大公私合营的国家资本主义经济，国家从各方面用于公私合营企业的投资为二五、○○○亿元。
    由于生产增加和商品流转额的扩大，铁道、交通、邮电等事业也应相应发展。本年度在这方面的拨款为一七六、四九三亿元，占经济建设费用的百分之一五点五九；比一九五三年在这方面的拨款增长百分之四二点○九。一九五四年铁道新线铺轨六○三公里，货运总量要比一九五三年增长百分之一五点五，客运总量要比一九五三年增长百分之一四。内河货运量要比一九五三年增长百分之二六点六，海上货运量要比一九五三年增长百分之四四。
      一九五四年的国家预算，不仅反映了国民经济的发展和社会主义经济因素的加强，也反映了国家对文化、教育、科学、卫生和社会福利事业的关心。
     一九五四年国家预算对社会、文化、教育、科学、卫生的拨款为三六六、九二○亿元（社会劳动保险费尚未计算在内），占国家预算总支出的百分之一四点七一，比一九五三年在这方面的拨款增长百分之一五点二。其中用于文化、教育、卫生支出为二七九、○四八亿元；用于社会救济和优抚支出四六、五七八亿元。一九五四年高等学校计划招生九○、五○五人，比一九五三年增加一三、九八八人。中等技术学校和工农速成中学招生一二七、一三○人，比一九五三年增加二四、五三五人。普通中学高中、初中共招生一、三四九、六五○人，比一九五三年增加三五三、四七六人。卫生部所属全国医院病床达到二○七、五三三张，比一九五三年增加一六、四六八张。
    在发展生产、提高劳动生产率（一九五四年规定国营工业提高劳动生产率百分之一三点二）的基础上，一九五四年全国国营企业职工、文化教育部门和国家机关工作人员的平均工资将比一九五三年提高百分之五点二。社会购买力将比一九五三年提高百分之一三点八，劳动人民的生活将获得进一步的改善。
    我们国家在大力进行经济建设的同时，必须注意加强国防力量，这是保证我们和平建设的重要因素。虽然我国从建国的那一天起，就一贯奉行着和平建设的政策，但对于美帝国主义好战分子的战争政策和敌视我国的行动，必须随时保持着高度的警惕。因此一九五四年国家预算中所规定的国防费，仍列了五二六、七○○亿元，为总支出的百分之二一点一一，这是完全必要的。
      对地方预算的安排
      一九五四年国家预算中，对地方预算也作了比较恰当的安排。在财政管理上，必须认真贯彻在中央统一领导和计划下的分级管理方针。
    一九五四年各省（市）地方预算支出总额为五九六、四六二亿元，占国家预算的百分之二三点九一，比一九五三年的地方预算支出总额增长百分之一四点九，其中地方经济建设费占地方预算的百分之二三点八六；社会文教费占地方预算的百分之四○点六四；行政管理费占地方预算的百分之二九点一六。一九五四年地方国营工业生产总值将比一九五三年的地方国营工业生产总值增长百分之三一点三。
    地方预算执行的稳妥与否，是关系国家预算收支平衡的重要因素之一，各级地方政府对于预算的执行，应进行严格的控制。总预备费和跨年度费用，要规定动用办法，严加审核。上年结余应尽可能用于增加周转金或补足地方国营企业的流动资金，以加强地方预算的后备力量。
    为增加生产，厉行节约，胜利完成一九五四年预算而奋斗
    一九五四年国家预算收入与支出的分配比例，充分说明了我国人民民主国家制度的优越性。一九五四年国家预算的编制，也比一九五三年有进步，所列收支都更加合乎实际，并注意结合了国家的信贷计划，这就使国家预算具有了更为确实可靠的基础。但是我们决不能因此就抱着万事大吉的态度；我们必须在执行预算的过程中，继续不断地努力增加收入和节约支出，争取一九五四年预算执行的结果，不但不至于动用上年结余，还要求获得更多的结余，以期更进一步地增强国家财政的后备力量。毛主席指示我们：“增产、节约、多留后备力量，是巩固国家预算的可靠的三道防线”，这就是我们在财政工作上必须认真贯彻的方针。
    为了保证一九五四年国家预算的实现，必须完成以下各项任务：
    第一、全面完成与超额完成一九五四年国民经济计划。这是保证圆满实现一九五四年国家预算的基础。各级政府、各企业单位，必须充分动员广大职工及人民，继续贯彻增产节约运动，努力增加产量、提高质量，降低成本。各部门降低成本的指标是：国营及地方国营工业降低百分之五点二，铁道交通运输降低百分之五点三，基本建设中的施工安装费用争取降低百分之八，国营商业贸易流通费率降低百分之一三点七。完成了降低成本的计划，就可以为国家积累巨量的资金。
    加强企业的财务管理，是保证完成以上计划的
  一项重要工作。一九五三年国营企业财务计划的编制和执行，虽然已较往年前进了一大步，除个别部门外，利润及基本折旧的提缴，大多数部门都超过了计划。但这方面的工作仍然存在着严重的缺点。一般的是生产计划特别是企业收入计划订得偏低，挖掘潜力不够。例如国内商业、铁道运输的企业收入计划就订得较低，因而执行结果超过很多。对利润、基本折旧基金的解缴，大多不及时和前松后紧，有的甚至长期占用应缴的款项。对重点建设抓的不紧，投资使用仍有分散现象，工程预算及工程造价普遍偏高，宽打窄用，积压材料等情况仍然严重。某些建筑安装工程，由于设计力量不够，施工准备不好，在一九五三年初曾发生严重的窝工现象。已完工程也有质量不合标准而返工重造的现象。这就造成了国家资金的浪费。
    为了克服这些缺点，各级党委、政府、经济机关、企业单位，必须严格遵守节约制度，与浪费现象进行坚决的斗争；必须注意寻找窍门、挖掘潜力、加强技术措施、改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，正确地制定合理的生产定额和技术定额；加强原材料物资管理工作，加强各经济部门的仓库保管工作，爱护机器，加强维护检修和安全措施；加速资金的周转，降低杂费开支标准，并及时地足额地提缴利润。
    第二、完成各项税收。这是顺利实现国家预算的关键。因此必须认真贯彻税收政策，抓紧收入，进一步改进征收管理工作。对工商户一面要加强爱国守法纳税的思想教育，一面要继续与偷税漏税现象作严肃的斗争。农业税工作必须继续执行中央人民政府政务院一九五三年六月关于农业税工作的指示所规定的各项原则，进一步贯彻公平合理和鼓励增产的负担政策。
    第三、节减国家机关经费，精简国家行政机构。这是国家积累工业化资金的一个重要方法。过去在经济建设事业费、文化教育事业费方面，定员定额仍有不合理现象，必须从下而上订定既切合实际又符合节约原则的编制定额和必要的实物使用标准与财务开支标准，逐级批准核定，作为核计预算、拨付资金和实施财务监督的依据。
    在国家机关中，目前仍然是机构大、层次多、冗员多，有些部门或单位的经费开支还有铺张浪费现象。必须切实地实行精简机构，适当地减少编制人员，以便提高工作效率，紧缩行政机关经费的开支。国家机关的编制，要坚持不经中央编制委员会批准，不得增加人员的规定。
    第四、加强财政监督工作，严格财政纪律。财政监督工作是帮助企业、事业部门和行政机关改善组织管理，贯彻经济核算，实行严格节约制度的重要方法。目前这项工作还很薄弱，检查也不深入。财政部门必须下决心纠正官僚主义和文牍主义，将财政监督列为本年财政工作的重要任务之一，有重点地对某些部门、地区进行实地检查：对企业部门，要检查他们降低成本计划、财务计划、利润折旧缴款计划是否完成，有无积压原材料和积压资金的现象，非生产的开支是否过大；对基本建设单位，要检查他们的工程造价是否过高，款项是否按计划使用，使用的效果如何；对文教事业机关，要检查他们的定员定额是否合理，事业计划与财务计划是否相符；对行政机关，要检查他们是否按中央规定，紧缩编制，精简人员，有无机构庞大，人浮于事的现象。
    第五、财政机关人员必须提高自己的政治业务水平，使政治与业务结合，理论与实际结合，展开批评和自我批评，反对骄傲自满的情绪，并在执行财政纪律上，尽到自己应尽的责任。要认识财政工作是一种综合性的关系到各方面的政治工作，必须服从党和政府的领导，必须依靠广大人民群众的支持，取得其他部门的配合和帮助，才能做好工作。而各级党委和政府对于财政工作领导的加强，经常关心和检查他们的工作，始终是我们完成财政工作任务的保障。
    我们相信，只要能够在工作中贯彻上述各项要求，那么，一九五四年国家预算的顺利实现，将是没有疑问的。　　　　（新华社）
