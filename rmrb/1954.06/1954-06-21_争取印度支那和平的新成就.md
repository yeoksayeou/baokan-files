Geneva dispatches

    New Achievements in the Struggle for Peace in Indochina
    By Our Correspondent Dù Bō

    At the sixteenth restricted meeting on June 19, the nine delegations participating in the discussion of the Indochina issue unanimously adopted a proposal on the issues of Laos and Cambodia. This proposal aims to make specific arrangements on the Laos and Cambodia issues, so as to promote the ceasefire in these two countries and the simultaneous ceasefire in Vietnam. The achievement of this agreement is an important progress in the discussions of the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue, and a new achievement following the agreement reached on May 29 on a rapid and simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina.

    The agreement on the issues of Laos and Cambodia was reached based on the proposal made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai at the fourteenth restricted meeting on June 16. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal pointed out that the cessation of hostilities in Laos and Cambodia should be realized simultaneously with the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam. To this end, representatives of the command headquarters of the belligerent parties should begin direct negotiations in Geneva and locally; and after the cessation of hostilities, no new troops, military personnel, weapons and ammunition should be allowed to enter from outside Indochina. The issue of the quantity and types of weapons needed for self-defense could be negotiated; the powers of the International Supervisory Commission should be extended to Laos and Cambodia, but the special circumstances of the two countries should be taken into account. This proposal is fully in line with the six-point proposal made by the Chinese delegation on May 27 and the spirit of the agreement on May 29. It demonstrates the sincerity and consistent spirit of consultation of the democratic and peace-loving countries in seeking a rapid and simultaneous ceasefire in Indochina.

    At that meeting on the 16th, the delegations participating in the meeting all considered Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal to be reasonable and "worthy of careful study." Even Smith, the US representative who deliberately tried to end the discussion on the Indochina issue immediately after sabotaging the discussion on the Korean issue, had to say at the time: "This proposal is moderate and reasonable," "Many points can be agreed upon, and some points are close to the proposals of the Lao and Cambodian representatives at today's meeting, so I think this proposal is worthy of careful study." As for the Western public opinion circles, they believe that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal has brought new hope for an early ceasefire in Indochina. France's "Combat" newspaper said on the 17th: "Mr. Zhou Enlai's proposal has aroused new hope for reaching an agreement; the worst has finally been avoided." London's "Times" said: "After the noisy and chaotic quarrel on the Korean issue ended on the 15th, the Indochina part of the Geneva Conference on the afternoon of the 16th seemed to have taken a welcome step forward... Mr. Zhou Enlai made a very conciliatory speech." London's "Daily Mail" even believed that "Zhou Enlai's speech has raised new hopes for achieving results at the Indochina conference in Geneva." The efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at the Indochina conference on the 16th brought a glimmer of hope for peace to the Geneva Conference, which had been overshadowed by the United States' sabotage of the Korean negotiations.

    However, it would be a big mistake for people to think that the US delegation's speech on the 16th meant that it was satisfied after destroying the Korean negotiations and would allow the Indochina issue to be resolved smoothly. In fact, at the same time as sabotaging the Korean negotiations, the United States was also actively conspiring to sabotage the Indochina negotiations, and wanted to strangle the discussion of the Indochina issue before the new French government was formed. This forced the spokesman of the French delegation in Geneva to issue a special statement late at night after the end of the Korean issue conference on the 15th, saying: "Any...attempt to end the Indochina negotiations would cause serious misunderstandings in French public opinion, which is most concerned about the seven-year war in Indochina," "and the issue of ending the nine-nation Indochina negotiations cannot occur before the French government expresses its consent."

    At almost the same moment, Dulles announced at a press conference in Washington that the United States had invited Churchill and Eden to visit the United States. Dulles brazenly said: "The United States has always believed that the Geneva Conference will not have any results or benefits, and this view is no secret. The United States still holds this view today." The "New York Herald Tribune" stirred up trouble on the same day, saying: "Now that the Geneva negotiations are nearing their end, Britain's hopes have been thwarted, and the consequences that the United States is 'worried' about have been realized... It is appropriate to convene a new brief and informal meeting." Public opinion generally believes that the United States' invitation to Churchill and Eden to visit the White House is betting on the failure of the discussion of the Indochina issue. Therefore, London's "Times" also said: "Probably the American leaders will suggest starting discussions on the establishment of a Southeast Asia Defense Treaty without delay." This fully illustrates the true intention of the United States to sabotage the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue.

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal on the 16th was an irresistible blow to the United States, which was painstakingly trying to continue to sabotage the Indochina negotiations. The unexpected and rapid formation of the new French government showed that the French people were determined to stop the war in Indochina, which once again thwarted Washington's wishful thinking. But as mentioned earlier, the United States never wants to give up. According to a report by a reporter from the London "Times" on the situation of the fifteenth restricted meeting on the 18th: "Today's Indochina restricted meeting began in an astonishing form (referring to the US representative speaking first), US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson first commented that Mr. Zhou Enlai's speech on Wednesday was 'unreasonable'. Robertson is attending the meeting on behalf of Mr. Smith, which is exactly the opposite of what Mr. Smith expressed on Wednesday." According to Western reporters familiar with the situation: Smith did not attend the Indochina issue meeting on the 18th and suddenly announced that he was going to Bern to visit the Swiss Federal Government. Robertson represented him at the meeting because Smith said on the 16th that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal was "reasonable." Later, he received a telegram from Washington asking him not to agree to any agreement under any circumstances. This made Smith's situation very embarrassing, so he had to slip away, and Robertson came forward to deny what he had said on the 16th.

    The US representative's trick to sabotage the agreement on the Indochina issue was immediately exposed by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and other representatives. It is reported that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai clearly pointed out in his speech that Robertson's task was to provoke disputes and agitate. It is worth noting that countries directly related to the Indochina issue such as France, Laos, and Cambodia still believe that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal can be used as a basis for discussion. The US representative's unreasonable attempt to sabotage the meeting failed.

    The final agreement on the issues of Laos and Cambodia, achieved on the basis of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal after breaking through the United States' multiple obstacles, shows that as long as both parties to the negotiations have a spirit of consultation and are willing to truly solve the problem, the meeting can progress. The United States' obstruction and sabotage activities can be defeated. There is no doubt that the achievement of the second agreement in the discussion of the Indochina issue is a new achievement for the people of Indochina and the French people, as well as the people of the world, in striving for the realization of peace in Indochina.

### 争取印度支那和平的新成就

    争取印度支那和平的新成就
    本报记者　杜波
    在六月十九日第十六次限制性会议上，参加印度支那问题讨论的九国代表团一致通过了一项关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的建议，以便在老挝和柬埔寨问题上作出具体安排，促使这两个国家的停火和越南的停火同时实现。这个协议的取得，是日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论的一个重要进展，是继五月二十九日达成在印度支那迅速同时停火协议之后的新的成就。
    关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的协议，是根据周恩来外长在六月十六日第十四次限制性会议上所提出的建议为基础达成的。周恩来外长的建议指出，老挝和柬埔寨境内的敌对行动应与越南敌对行动的停止同时实现。为此，交战双方司令部的代表应在日内瓦和当地开始直接谈判；而在敌对行动停止后，便不许从印度支那境外进入新的部队军事人员以及武器和弹药，为自卫所需要的武器的数量和种类问题则可协商；国际监察委员会的权力应扩展到老挝和柬埔寨，但要照顾到两国的特殊情况。这个建议是与中国代表团五月二十七日提出的六点建议和五月二十九日的协议精神完全一致的，它表现了民主和平国家谋求在印度支那迅速同时停火的诚意和一贯的协商精神。
    在十六日的那次会议上，参加会议的各国代表团都认为周恩来外长的这个建议是合理的，“值得仔细研究”。甚至蓄意立即继破坏朝鲜问题的讨论之后结束印度支那问题讨论的美国代表史密斯，当时也不得不说：“这个建议是温和的、合理的”，
  “许多地方是可以同意的，而且某些点与老挝、柬埔寨代表今天会议中提案也有接近的地方，因此我认为这个提案是值得仔细研究的”。至于西方各国的舆论界，更认为周恩来外长的这个建议给印度支那的早日停火带来了新的希望。法国“战斗报”十七日说：“周恩来先生的建议引起达成协议的新希望；最坏的事终于避免过去了。”伦敦“泰晤士报”说：“十五日在朝鲜问题上一阵乌烟瘴气与混乱的争吵结束之后，十六日下午日内瓦会议印度支那部分似乎向前走了可以欢迎的一步……周恩来先生作了一个十分和解的演说。”伦敦“每日邮报”更认为“周恩来的演说，提高了在日内瓦的印度支那会议获致结果的新希望。”中国、苏联和越南民主共和国在十六日印度支那会议上的努力，使得因美国破坏了朝鲜问题谈判而笼罩暗影的日内瓦会议又呈现了和平的希望。
    但是，人们如果认为美国代表团在十六日会上的讲话是表示它在破坏了朝鲜谈判之后已经心满意足，会让印度支那问题顺利地得到解决，那就大错特错了。事实上就在破坏朝鲜问题谈判的同时，美国也在积极进行破坏印度支那问题谈判的阴谋，想在法国的新政府还没有组成以前就一手把印度支那问题的讨论加以扼杀。这就使得在日内瓦的法国代表团发言人，在十五日朝鲜问题会议结束后不得不在深夜特别声明说：“任何……想要结束印度支那谈判的企图，都会引起最关心印度支那七年战争的法国的舆论严重的误解”，“而在法国政府表示同意之前，不能发生结束九国印度支那谈判的问题。”
    差不多就在同一个时刻，杜勒斯在华盛顿的记者招待会上宣布了美国邀请邱吉尔和艾登访问美国。杜勒斯肆无忌惮地说：“美国始终认为日内瓦会议是不会有什么结果或好处的，这种看法不是什么秘密的事情。美国今天还是这样的看法。”“纽约先驱论坛报”同一天更兴风作浪地说：“现在日内瓦谈判已趋于结局，英国的希望受到挫折，美国
  ‘担心’的后果已实现……召开一个新的简短和非正式的会议是适当的。”一般舆论认为，美国邀请邱吉尔艾登访问白宫就是把“宝”押在印度支那问题的讨论失败的基础上的。因此，伦敦“泰晤士报”也说：“大概美国领导者们会建议不延迟地开始讨论成立东南亚防御公约。”这就完全说明了美国要破坏印度支那问题和平解决的真意所在。
    周恩来外长十六日的建议，对于处心积虑要想继续破坏印度支那问题谈判的美国来说，是一个不可抗拒的打击。法国新政府的得以出乎华盛顿的意料而迅速成立，表明法国人民坚决要求停止印度支那的战争，使华盛顿的如意算盘再一次失算。但是正如前面所说的，美国是绝不想善罢甘休的。据伦敦“泰晤士报”记者报道十八日第十五次限制性会议的情况说：“今日印度支那限制性会议以令人惊异的形式而开始（按指美国代表首先发言），负责远东事务的美国助理国务卿罗伯逊首先评论周恩来先生在星期三的发言是‘不合理的’。罗伯逊是代理史密斯先生出席会议的，而与史密斯先生在星期三所表示的意见刚好相反。”据熟悉情况的西方记者透露：史密斯十八日没有参加印度支那问题的会议，突然宣布往伯尔尼去拜访瑞士联邦政府，而由罗伯逊代表他出席会议，是因为史密斯在十六日说了周恩来外长的建议“合理”，以后又接到了华盛顿的电报，要他无论如何不要同意任何协议，这就使史密斯的处境非常狼狈，只好溜之大吉，而由罗伯逊出面来抵赖他十六日所说过的话。
    美国代表这种破坏印度支那问题取得协议的诡计，立刻被周恩来外长和其他代表所揭破。据悉，周恩来外长在发言中明确指出，罗伯逊所担任的任务是想挑起争论，并进行挑动。值得注意的是，直接与印度支那问题有关的国家如法国、老挝、柬埔寨都仍认为周恩来外长的建议可以做为讨论的基础。美国代表蛮不讲理地硬想破坏会议的进行遂未得逞。
    关于老挝和柬埔寨问题终于在击破美国的多方阻挠下，在周恩来外长的建议的基础上取得协议，说明只要谈判的双方都具有协商精神，愿意真正解决问题，会议是可以进展的。美国的阻挠和破坏活动是可以被击败的。毫无疑问，印度支那问题的讨论取得第二个协议，是印度支那人民和法国人民以及全世界人民争取实现印度支那和平的一个新的成就。  六月十九日
