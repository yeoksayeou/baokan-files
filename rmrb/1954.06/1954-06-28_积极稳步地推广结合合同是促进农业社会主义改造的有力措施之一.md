The General Situation of Combined Contract Development in North China

As early as 1950, basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural mutual aid groups in the old liberated areas of North China began to have combined contract forms such as "statistical supply," "deposit and order," and "order form." With the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and in response to the needs of the national economy, under the vigorous promotion of party committees at all levels, and on the basis of the above forms, they gradually developed into one-time contracts, monthly, quarterly, and even annual supply and marketing combined contracts. After 1952, combined contracts were widely developed. According to incomplete statistics, in 1952, 2,500 basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives signed various forms of combined contracts with more than 90,000 mutual aid groups (including a small number of agricultural production cooperatives). In the four special districts of Tangshan, Hebei, alone, a total of 34,804 contracts were signed, with a total supply and marketing value of 225.9 billion yuan, accounting for 13 percent of the total business volume of supply and marketing cooperatives. The contract forms are diverse. In addition to the "counter-current" supply and marketing combined contracts, there are also cotton and grain "pre-purchase," "deposit and pre-sale," and "deposit and order" contract forms. However, in many places, due to rapid development, insufficient leadership experience, and the adoption of the methods of "universal promotion" and "guaranteed supply and sales" regardless of conditions, many contracts became mere formalities. Under this influence, some local leading cadres developed views of doubt, wavering, and even cancellation of combined contracts, such as thinking that "there are not many benefits, but a lot of trouble," and "it's the same whether you order or not." In addition, in 1953, some rural areas did not fully understand the spirit of opposing "five excesses," and most areas abandoned specific leadership, causing combined contracts to fall into a state of free flow. However, in some areas, such as the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province and certain counties in the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province, this advanced form of trade was still promoted. In counties such as Wuxiang and Pingshun, due to the better foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, combined contracts have become a regular economic system for farmers to contact supply and marketing cooperatives in an organized manner. According to statistics from the Wuxiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in 1953, the total value of contract operations for the year accounted for more than 50 percent of the total business volume. Especially in terms of production materials, contract operations accounted for 87 percent of the total value, with the largest proportion; in terms of living materials, it accounted for 53 percent, and in terms of agricultural product procurement, it accounted for 36 percent. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's North China Bureau Rural Work Department publicized the general task of the state during the transition period last winter, the leading organs in various parts of the North China region have once again attached importance to combined contracts, so the development has been rapid since last winter, and combined contracts have shown new characteristics. For example, the Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi, which had relatively poor combined contract development in the past, has had new developments since February this year. According to incomplete statistics, basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives in the district have signed 3,202 annual and seasonal contracts with 339 agricultural production cooperatives and 2,563 mutual aid groups, with a total value of more than 20.9 billion yuan. The new characteristics of these contracts are: the promotion of agricultural and sideline products occupies the main position. For example, in the total value of more than 20.9 billion yuan, the promotion of agricultural and sideline products accounts for more than two-thirds, followed by production materials accounting for 23 percent, while living materials only account for one-tenth. This feature reflects the new situation in the rural market after the unified purchase and sale of grain, that is, urban and rural economic exchanges are carried out through new channels—socialist commercial channels. Therefore, combined contracts have not only become a popular form of exchange for farmers, but also the content of the contracts has undergone new changes.

      The Superiority of Combined Contracts

    Practice over the years has proven that the role and superiority of combined contracts are very significant. It provides an important and practical method for the country to promote the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, to further organize urban and rural trade in a planned way, to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and to guide farmers' production according to the national economic plan so as to gradually bring it into the orbit of the national plan, and to improve the management of supply and marketing cooperatives and better implement the policy of serving agricultural production. Specifically:

    First, from the perspective of production: (1) Farmers have obtained guarantees from supply and marketing cooperatives for the promotion of products and the supply of major production and living materials, which makes it easier for farmers to concentrate on production, so it is beneficial to agricultural production. As many farmers have said: "In the past, we had to worry about three things (production, buying, and selling), but in the future, we only need to worry about one thing (production)." (2) Through the signing of contracts, agricultural production has been guided, so that the types, specifications, and quality of products are better in line with the needs of the state, and the planning of agricultural production has been strengthened. (3) Because it promotes agricultural production, it powerfully attracts farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation and promotes the socialist transformation of agriculture. In 1952, the Wanglanzhuang Basic-level Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengnan County signed 53 combined contracts with the Gaoxiandian Village Agricultural Production Cooperative and mutual aid groups, with a total value of 1.6644 billion yuan. Not only was the supply timely and the price cheap, but it also saved 26 workdays (no need to go to market). The Baijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wuxiang County signed a contract with the Li Wuqi Mutual Aid Group for the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools, saving the mutual aid group 52 workdays and 354,000 yuan. Therefore, the members reflected: "Priority, insurance, labor saving, and money saving, who would be willing to work alone!" It is precisely because combined contracts have these benefits that they powerfully promote farmers' participation in the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    Secondly, from the perspective of supply and marketing cooperatives: (1) This kind of contract, which starts from production and is based on the production plans of the groups and cooperatives, lays a reliable foundation for strengthening the planning of supply and marketing cooperatives and points out the way for supply and marketing business to serve production. Therefore, the previous blind operation, commodity backlog (or out-of-stock), and slow turnover of supply and marketing cooperatives have been reduced, and the speed of capital and commodity turnover has been increased. (2) Turning possible transactions into guaranteed transactions in the form of contracts expands the business volume, reduces farmers' activities in the free market, and gradually cuts off farmers' ties with capitalism. For example, the Daizhao Basic-level Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wuxiang County, due to the promotion of combined contracts, the total business volume in 1952 increased nearly three times compared with 1951. The expansion of the business of supply and marketing cooperatives is the shrinking of the capitalist commercial position in the countryside. (3) In the process of signing contracts, we further understand the needs of members and ordinary residents and better rectify the policy of serving agricultural production. Before the development of combined contracts, the masses reflected: "The supply and marketing cooperative says it is serving production, but in fact, we do our production, and they do their business. They don't have what we want, and we don't want what they have"; after the implementation of combined contracts, the masses' statement changed to: "Whatever we want, they supply, which saves labor and worry. We can't do without the cooperative."

    Finally, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups achieve organized and planned production and transactions through combined contracts, which is conducive to the development of the entire national economy and creates conditions for the smooth development of industrial production.

    Preliminary Experience in Developing Combined Contracts

    (1) The production plans of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups are the basis of contract trade. Therefore, the supply and marketing plans based on the production plans of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups are the main basis for signing combined contracts. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups should, with the active assistance of supply and marketing cooperatives, learn from household visits, typical investigations, and publicity of the state's support for agricultural production and the types and specifications of agricultural products needed by the state, so that members can better arrange the production and sales quantities of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products and the needs of members' production and living materials, formulate annual or seasonal purchase and sales plans, and formally sign combined contracts after full consultation.

      (2) Starting from the current situation of the small-scale peasant economy, the promotion of combined contracts must adhere to the principle of gradual transition from simple to complex, from short-term to long-term, acting according to capacity, and steady development. Generally speaking, most of them start from relatively simple supply and marketing contracts and then gradually develop into a combination of production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperative forms. Whether it is a simple supply and marketing combination or a more complex three-party combination, it is based on the production and needs of members and group members. The types of commodities stipulated in the contract are currently mainly based on the supply of production materials and major living materials and the promotion of large-volume agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. The blind practice of "guaranteed supply and sales" and "full response and permission" is not feasible. Many regions have failed to grasp this characteristic, so they have failed to implement according to the provisions of the contract and lost the credibility of the contract; some have also stipulated too many types of products in the contract, with more than 40 types of living materials alone, making it difficult to distinguish between "contract commodities" and "non-contract commodities," which also weakens the role of the contract. In addition, the contract period should proceed from reality and can be long if possible, and short if possible, depending on different conditions. Generally speaking, under the current conditions, except for better agricultural production cooperatives that can sign annual combined contracts, it is generally better to adopt the method of "annual plans, signing contracts on a quarterly and monthly basis, and supplying and purchasing in batches"; as for signing contracts with seasonal temporary mutual aid groups and individual farmers, it is advisable to adopt simple forms such as "one contract per item," and the more feasible of such contracts are supply and marketing and pre-purchase contracts. After the contract is signed, it should be binding on both parties, and the seriousness of the contract must be maintained as much as possible. However, because the entire national economy is currently in a process of transformation and various plans are difficult to be completely accurate, attention should also be paid to not being too mechanical in the implementation of the contract. When it is necessary to renegotiate under changing conditions, it is necessary to re-change the contract terms after consultation under the principle of taking care of both parties.

    (3) "Voluntary combination, mutual guarantee of two benefits" is the principle that must be observed in combined contracts, and the granting view is wrong. For example, the past emphasis only on the various guarantees of supply and marketing cooperatives to farmers (which is necessary), but not educating farmers to abide by the provisions of the contract, forming the practice of executing the contract when it is beneficial and tearing up the contract when there is little benefit, is extremely wrong. This one-sided peasant view harms the interests of the state and also promotes the spontaneous trend of peasants, so it must be opposed.

    (4) Strengthening the party's ideological and political leadership and the economic support of state-owned commerce is the main guarantee for the realization of the contract. In the entire process of signing the contract, the party's leadership must oppose the purely profit-seeking view of supply and marketing cooperatives, and at the same time must oppose the idea of farmers hoarding and selling at high prices. The experience of the Beidan Che Basic-level Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi, in signing contracts is very good. They held a members' representative meeting before signing the contract to conduct "democratic evaluation," "publicize costs," and "announce profits," which made the price issue reasonably resolved, so the members' trust in the contract was also enhanced.

    Issues to be Noted in Developing Combined Contracts in the Future

    (1) Conscientiously summarize existing experience, educate cadres and the masses, actively promote, and steadily advance. In areas with a good foundation for combined contracts, vigorous development can be carried out, and the coordination of various rural economic tasks should be strengthened so as to coordinate with each other to serve agricultural production increase. In areas with a poor foundation for combined contracts, serious typical experiments should also be carried out, and experience should be gained before gradually developing.

    (2) While promoting the supply and marketing combined contracts of supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, various contract forms such as "deposit and pre-purchase," "deposit and order," "purchase and sale on behalf," and "credit contracts" should continue to be adopted according to different conditions in order to promote the development and socialist transformation of agricultural production in many ways. However, do not relax the normal supply of production and living materials to individual farmers because of emphasizing the combined contract between supply and marketing cooperatives and mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

      (3) In the future promotion of combined contracts, attention must be paid to the new changes in the rural market. In the past, the large-volume materials stipulated in the contract for promotion were grain, but now grain and other large-volume local and special products are basically purchased by the state in a unified manner. Some of the supplies that were supplied in the past are now sold by the state in a unified manner. Therefore, when signing contracts, it is necessary to study the content of the contract from this situation, so that the supply and sales aspects stipulated in the contract can be planned to meet the needs of the state and be conducive to the development of production. In this regard, we need to continue to create experience.

      (4) Supply and marketing cooperatives must pay attention to the combined contracts with handicraft production cooperatives and production groups, which is of great significance for supporting handicraft production, meeting the production and living needs of farmers, and promoting the socialist transformation of handicrafts. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives should also strengthen contacts with credit cooperatives and credit groups to achieve the goal of each of the three rural mutual aid and cooperation organizations having its own division of labor and cooperating with each other and promoting each other.

      (5) Party committees and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must strengthen the leadership of combined contract work. In addition to carrying out extensive publicity and strengthening the political and ideological education of cadres and the masses, they should conduct in-depth inspections, discover and solve problems in the promotion, summarize experience in a timely manner, improve cadres, cultivate typical examples, and demonstrate and promote.

    积极稳步地推广结合合同是促进农业社会主义改造的有力措施之一
    华北地区结合合同发展的一般情况
    华北老解放区的基层供销合作社与农业互助组远在一九五○年就开始出现了“统计供应”、“存实订购”、“订货单”等结合合同形式。随着农村互助合作运动的发展和适应国民经济的需要，在各级党委的大力提倡下，在上述形式的基础上，逐步发展为一事一合同、按月、按季以至常年的供销结合合同。一九五二年以后，结合合同有了广泛的发展。据不完全统计，一九五二年有二千五百个基层供销社与九万多个互助组（内有少数农业生产合作社）签订了各种形式的结合合同。仅河北唐山等四个专区即共订合同三万四千八百零四件，供销总值达二千二百五十九亿元，占供销合作社经营总额的百分之十三。合同形式是多样的，除“对流式”的供销结合合同外，还有棉粮“预购”、“存实预售”、“存实订购”等合同形式。但很多地方因发展迅速，领导经验不足，且不顾条件地采取“普遍推广”、“包供包销”的办法，致使很多合同流于形式。在这一影响下，有些地方领导干部对结合合同产生了怀疑、动摇以至取消的观点，如认为“好处不多，麻烦不少”、“订不订都一样”，加以一九五三年若干农村对反对“五多”的精神领会不全面，大部地区放弃了具体领导，使结合合同陷于自流。但在部分地区，如山西省的长治专区与河北省唐山专区的某些县份，还是坚持推行了这一先进的贸易形式，如武乡、平顺等县，由于互助合作基础较好，结合合同已成为农民有组织地与供销合作社联系的一种经常的经济制度。据武乡县供销合作社一九五三年统计，全年合同经营总值占经营总额的百分之五十以上，尤其是生产资料方面，合同经营即占总值的百分之八十七，比重最大；生活资料中占百分之五十三，农产品收购中占百分之三十六。中共中央华北局农村工作部自去年冬季国家在过渡时期总任务宣传后，华北区各地领导机关对结合合同再次引起了重视，因而去冬以来发展较快，同时结合合同出现了新的特点。如山西运城专区，是过去结合合同开展比较差的地区，但从今年二月份之后，有了新的发展。据不完全统计，该区基层供销合作社与三百三十九个农业生产合作社和二千五百六十三个互助组签订了常年的与季节的合同共三千二百零二份，总值二百零九亿余元。这些合同的新的特点是：推销农、副业产品占了主要的地位，如在二百零九亿余元的总值中，推销农、副业产品即占到三分之二还强，其次是生产资料占到百分之二十三，而生活资料仅占十分之一。这一特点反映出粮食统购统销后农村市场的新情况，即城乡经济交流是经过新的渠道——社会主义的商业渠道进行的，因此结合合同不仅是成为农民所欢迎的交流形式，而且合同的内容也引起了新的变化。
      结合合同的优越性
    几年来的实践证明，结合合同的作用及其优越性是很显著的。对于国家促进小农经济的社会主义改造，为进一步地有计划组织城乡贸易、巩固工农联盟和根据国家经济计划指导农民生产，使之逐步纳入国家计划轨道，以及改善供销合作社的经营管理，更好地贯彻为农业生产服务的方针等方面，都提供了一个重要的切实的方法。具体说来：
    首先，从生产方面看：（一）农民从供销合作社方面取得了推销产品和供应主要生产、生活资料的保证，这就便于农民们集中精力安心生产，所以对农业生产是有利的。正如许多农民所说：“过去操三条心（生产、买、卖），今后操一条心（生产）就行了”。（二）通过订立合同，指导了农业生产，使产品种类、规格、质量更好地符合于国家的需要，加强了农业生产的计划性。（三）由于促进了农业生产，就有力地吸引了农民走互助合作的道路，推动了农业的社会主义改造。丰南县王兰庄基层供销合作社与高先甸村农业生产合作社、互助组在一九五二年订立结合合同五十三件，总值十六亿六千四百万元，不仅供应及时，价格便宜，还省工（不用赶集）二十六个。武乡县白家庄供销合作社与李五七互助组订立了供应肥料、农具的合同，使互助组省工五十二个，省钱三十五万四千元。所以组员们反映：“优先、保险、省工、省钱，谁还愿意单干哩！”正因为结合合同有这些好处，因而它就有力地促进了农民参加互助合作运动。
    其次，从供销合作社方面来说：（一）这种从生产出发，并以组、社生产计划为基础的合同，为供销合作社的加强经营计划性打下了可靠的基础，也为供销业务服务生产指出了道路。因此，以往供销合作社的盲目经营、商品积压（或脱销）、周转迟缓的现象减少了，资金和商品周转的速度提高了。（二）把可能的交易用合同形式变为有保证的交易，扩大了经营额，减少了农民在自由市场上的活动，逐步地割断了农民与资本主义的联系。如武乡县岱照基层供销合作社，由于推广了结合合同，一九五二年经营总值较一九五一年扩大近三倍。供销合作社业务的扩大，便是资本主义商业在农村阵地的缩小。（三）在订立合同中进一步了解了社员和一般居民的需要，更好地端正了为农业生产服务的方针。未开展结合合同以前，群众反映：“供销社说的是为生产服务，实际是咱搞咱的生产，他做他的买卖。咱要的他没有，他有的咱不要”；推行了结合合同以后，群众的说法变为：“咱要啥，他供啥，又省工，又省心，不靠合作社可不行了”。
    最后，供销合作社与农业生产合作社、互助组通过结合合同达到有组织有计划的生产和交易，有利于整个国民经济的发展，并为工业生产创造了顺利发展的条件。
    发展结合合同的初步经验
    （一）农业生产合作社、互助组的生产计划是合同贸易的基础，因此，围绕着农业社、互助组的生产计划及在此基础上所产生的供销计划是签订结合合同的主要依据。农业生产合作社、互助组应在供销合作社的积极协助下，通过逐户了解，典型调查，宣传国家对农业生产的支援和国家对农产品需要的种类、规格，使社员们更好地安排农、副、土、特产品的产销数量与社员生产、生活资料的需求，订出全年的或季节性的购销计划，并经过充分协商，正式签订结合合同。
      （二）从小农经济现状出发，推广结合合同必须坚持由简到繁，由短期到长期，量力而行，稳步发展的方针。一般地说，大都是从比较简单的供销合同开始而后逐步发展为生产与供销和信用三种合作形式的结合，不论简单的供销结合，还是比较复杂的三方面的结合形式，又都是以社员、组员的生产和需求为基础的。合同中所规定的商品种类，目前大都是以供应生产资料及主要的生活资料和推销大宗的农、副、土、特产品为主。盲目的“包供包销”、“满应满许”的作法是行不通的。许多地区由于对这一特点掌握不够，所以发生不能按照合同的规定执行，丧失了合同信用；也有在合同中所订产品种类过多，仅生活资料即达四十余种，使“合同商品”和“非合同商品”区分不清，这也减弱了合同的作用。此外，合同期限应从实际出发，根据不同条件，可长者长，可短者短。一般地说，在目前条件下，除和较好的农业生产合作社可订立常年结合合同外，一般地以采用“常年计划，按季、按月签订合同，分批供应、分批收购”的办法较好；至于和季节性的临时互助组和个体农民订立合同时，以“一事一合同”等简单的形式为宜，而此种合同比较易行者为供销、预购合同。合同订立后，对双方应具有约束性，必须尽可能地保持合同的严肃性。但因目前整个国民经济正处于改造过程，各种计划很难完全准确，因此，在执行合同时，还应注意不要过分机械，在条件变化的情况下，有必要重新议定时，需要在双方照顾的原则下，经过协商重新改变合同条件。
    （三）“自愿结合，互保两利”是结合合同必须遵守的原则，恩赐观点是错误的。如以往曾经发生过的只强调供销合作社对农民的各种保证（这是必要的），而不教育农民遵守合同规定，形成有利即执行合同，利少即扯毁合同的作法是极端错误的。这种片面的农民观点，既损害了国家的利益，又助长了农民的自发趋势，因而必须反对。
    （四）加强党的思想政治领导和国营商业的经济支持，是实现合同的主要保证。在订立合同的全部过程中，党的领导必须反对供销合作社的单纯营利观点，同时也必须反对农民中的高价惜售的思想。山西平顺县北耽车基层供销合作社在订立合同中的经验是很好的，它们在订立合同前召开社员代表会，进行“民主评价”、“公开成本”、“公布利润”，这就使得价格问题得到了合理解决，所以社员们对合同的信任也就增强。
    今后发展结合合同应注意的问题
    （一）认真总结已有经验，教育干部和群众，积极推广，稳步前进。在结合合同基础较好的地区，可以大力发展，应加强农村各种经济工作的配合，以便互相协调地为农业增产服务。在结合合同基础较差的地区，也应认真进行典型试验，取得经验后再逐步开展。
    （二）在推广供销合作社与农业生产合作社、互助组的供销结合合同的同时，应根据不同条件，继续采用“存实预购”、“存实订购”、“代购代销”、“信用合同”等多种合同形式，以便从多方面促进农业生产的发展和社会主义的改造。但不要因为强调供销合作社与互助合作组织之间的结合合同，而放松了对单干农民的生产与生活资料的正常供应。
      （三）今后推广结合合同中，必须注意到农村市场新的变化情况，过去合同中规定推销的大宗物资是粮食，而今粮食和其他大宗土、特产品基本上由国家统购了，过去供应的部分今天有的由国家统销了，因此签订合同时，就必须从这一情况出发去研究合同的内容，使合同中所规定的供、销两方面更能够有计划地达到既照顾到国家的需要而又有利生产的发展。在这一方面还需要继续创造经验。
      （四）供销合作社必须注意与手工业生产合作社和生产小组之间的结合合同，这对支持手工业生产，满足农民生产、生活需要，促进手工业的社会主义改造具有其重大意义。同时，供销合作社还应加强与信用合作社、信用小组的联系，实现农村三种互助合作各有分工而又相互配合、相互促进的目的。
      （五）各级党委和供销合作社必须加强对结合合同工作的领导，除进行广泛宣传、加强干部和群众的政治思想教育外，应深入检查，发现与解决在推广中的问题，及时总结经验，提高干部，培养典型，示范推广。
