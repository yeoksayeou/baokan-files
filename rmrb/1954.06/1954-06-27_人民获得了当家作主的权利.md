    The People Have Gained the Right to Be Masters of Their Own Affairs
    Apprentices Have Come to the Fore
    Kang Shaoqi is the chairman of the trade union of the private Wuyi Iron Factory in Beijing. He lost his parents at a young age and became an apprentice in a private iron factory at the age of twelve, enduring oppression and torment.
    Every day, he would get up at dawn and work until midnight. In addition to blacksmithing, he also had to cook, carry water, and clean the house... He was perpetually underfed and poorly clothed, living in a small, airless shack like a dog kennel. Physical abuse and verbal insults were commonplace. When the boss was angry, he would slap him a few times; when he was really angry, he would swing the blacksmith's hammer at him. Once, he accidentally overheated the iron, and the boss used a red-hot iron rod to beat him, leaving him covered in wounds. In the dead of winter, on nights with northwest winds, he often had to go a long way to fetch water. Sometimes, he would accidentally slip on the icy ground and be unable to get up for a long time. Four years later, when he became a worker, he only earned fourteen catties of millet per month. The year before the liberation of Beijing, because he was underfed, he worked during the day and pedaled a rickshaw at night. But even then, he suffered indignities. Once, on Huguosi Street, a Kuomintang military officer accidentally bumped into his rickshaw. The fellow was utterly unreasonable and rushed up to slap him several times. Kuomintang police also ran over and cursed him: "Damn it, none of you people are any good."
    Now, things are completely different. He said with a smile: "Comrades, don't laugh at me. Back then, I couldn't even afford clothes. Now, I've completely changed. Look! I'm dressed neatly, and I even bought a watch and a brand-new bicycle with my wages! Compared to then, how can this life not make me happy!"
    After liberation, with the help of the Party, Kang Shaoqi's political awareness improved. He actively participated in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, and resolutely struggled against the capitalists' illegal activities such as using substandard materials. Later, he mobilized workers to improve production and organized workers to participate in the factory's management, greatly improving the factory's production situation. This time, he was elected as a people's representative and participated in the first session of the first People's Congress of Chongwen District. After studying the draft constitution, his enthusiasm increased even more. In his own words: "I am a worker in a private factory, and now I am also responsible for trade union work. The people trust me and elected me as a representative. I must show the spirit of a worker being the master of his own affairs and serve the people and the country in my own work. I will help my fellow workers improve their enthusiasm for production, mobilize the workers to supervise and help the capitalists take the path of state capitalism. I will actively improve the factory's management and give play to the positive role of private enterprises in the national economy."
    Old Rickshaw Worker Xie Hong Elected as a City Representative
    This January, old rickshaw worker Xie Hong was elected as a district people's representative in the Haibeisi Street police station election district in Qianmen District, Beijing. He took the certificate of election with trembling hands, looked at it again and again, touched it again and again, and his eyes moistened. He said: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I, Xie Hong, wouldn't be where I am today."
    Xie Hong is forty-nine years old this year. His father died when he was four months old. His mother took him and his older brother and sister, but they had no way to make a living, so they gave the older sister away. When he was ten years old, he saw other children going to school and wanted to study too, but he couldn't afford it after a few days. At the age of sixteen, he became an apprentice at a beer company. Originally, the term was five years, but he was laid off after only three years. Xie Hong had no choice but to pull a rickshaw to earn a living.
    In the old society, rickshaw pullers were always subject to others' anger and were often beaten. Xie Hong said: "Once, I pulled someone to a destination, and the customer hadn't paid yet, but the police wanted to drive me away. I said one sentence, and the police said fiercely: You're still arguing! He beat me mercilessly, leaving my upper body black and blue, and my leg was also injured, making me limp for more than ten days. Even then, I still had to pull the rickshaw. If I didn't work, I wouldn't have food to eat."
    Not long after the liberation of Beijing, rickshaw workers organized a trade union. Xie Hong had his own organization and a place to speak, and he was extremely happy. He was elected as the leader of the trade union group. In 1951, he was also elected by the Haibeisi Street residents as a public security committee member and a street propagandist. When people are happy, they are full of energy, and Xie Hong worked harder and harder. He started a reading group, pedaling his rickshaw during the day and coming back at night to read the newspaper and talk about current affairs. In the political movements such as suppressing counter-revolutionaries, resisting America and aiding Korea, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, Xie Hong was always busy day and night. He set up a blackboard newspaper in the alley. Sometimes he would pedal his rickshaw for half a day and then run back to write on the blackboard newspaper, draw cartoons, and still read the newspaper as usual in the evening.
    During the general election last year, Xie Hong became even busier. One night, several women from the alley visited him and said: The residents of Haibeisi Street elected you as a representative to the District People's Congress. Xie Hong was stunned when he heard this, and it took him a long time to say one sentence: "What can I do?" The women unanimously praised his spirit of serving the masses. Xie Hong was both excited and uneasy, and he didn't sleep all night.
    Xie Hong was not only elected as a representative to the Qianmen District People's Congress and a juror of the Qianmen District People's Court, but was also recently elected as a representative to the Municipal People's Congress at the first session of the first Qianmen District People's Congress. Xie Hong said: "The draft constitution stipulates that the National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power. This time, I was elected as a representative to the Municipal People's Congress, and soon I will participate in the Municipal People's Congress meeting and elect representatives to the National People's Congress. The masses trust me so much, I must collect the opinions of the masses and complete the tasks assigned to me by the masses."
    The Honor of the People's Police
    Among the people's representatives of Dongdan District, there is a people's policeman named Yao Ronghua. He is only twenty years old this year.
    Last January, Yao Ronghua was transferred from the Public Security Cadre School to the police station. The leadership assigned him a responsibility area, and he tried to maintain close contact with the masses.
    During the rainy season, some residents' houses often collapsed. Therefore, no matter day or night, whenever it rained, Yao Ronghua couldn't stay in the station. One evening, it was pouring rain, and he estimated that the house of Grandma Guo at No. 4 Pailouguan, Nanxiaojie, might be in danger. This young people's policeman appeared at the gate of Grandma Guo's house. At this time, the water in the courtyard was rising, and it was about to flood into the south room. The old lady was worried in the north room. Yao Ronghua knew that there was a culvert in the courtyard, so he rolled up his pants without hesitation, braved the rain and went into the water to open the ditch, so that the rainwater that was about to enter the house slowly drained away.
    Yao Ronghua was soaked to the bone, standing in front of Grandma Guo with a smile. The old lady said with emotion: "Comrade Yao! To tell you the truth, in the past, when the police encountered rain, they were eager to take shelter from the rain, but I have never seen one like you. Times have changed, and the police have become the people's own."
    Recently, he participated in the first session of the Dongdan District People's Congress and discussed the draft constitution. He cited a fact that he had personally experienced and said: "The draft constitution was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. During the Laishui Campaign in 1947, he was the head of the village's children's corps. He and other children and women went to the front line to comfort the wounded. Many wounded soldiers were transported from the front to the rear. Although they were bleeding, they did not look troubled and were always concerned about the victory on the front line. The draft constitution records the victorious achievements of these soldiers and the people of the whole country. Who can say that the draft constitution was easily obtained?"
    Yao Ronghua spent more than four years as an apprentice in the Senmao Leather Shoe Store. In the store, he had to make the bed for the boss, cook, and empty the chamber pot every day. If he did something wrong, he would be beaten and scolded. When Beijing was about to be liberated, the Kuomintang ordered every store to send people to dig trenches outside Chaoyangmen. The boss saw that his hand had festered, but still insisted on sending him. As a result, his right arm swelled up and he couldn't move it. He discussed with the boss about seeing a doctor, but the boss said: "If you have money, go and treat it yourself!" It was winter at that time, and he felt both pain and cold.
    After liberation, the hard days finally came to an end. Yao Ronghua, like many young apprentices, was among the first to join the trade union. In 1952, he entered the Public Security Cadre School. He said: "Compared with the past, it is really heaven and earth."
      A Shop Assistant's Recollection
    Zuo Xinru is a shop assistant at the Qingyitang Pharmacy in Qianmen District, Beijing, and the deputy director of the Qianmen District Shop Assistants' Work Committee. He said: "Now, we can sit on an equal footing with the manager and discuss matters together, and we can also give the manager advice. In the past, that was something we couldn't even dream of. I started my life as a shop assistant at the age of sixteen, and I went to five pharmacies in a row. At that time, in order to keep my job, I worked diligently, but I was still often fired for no reason."
    Speaking of this, he recalled an incident in his twenty years of shop assistant life. In 1943, Zuo Xinru was forced to run to Rehe to ask relatives and friends for help, and finally became a shop assistant at the Chengde branch of Hongdatang in Beijing. One day, a Kuomintang secret agent came to the counter to buy medicine without paying. Zuo Xinru was a shop assistant, how could he dare not ask for money? The fellow turned his face and said, "Do you know who I am?" Zuo Xinru said: "No matter who you are, we are doing business, and it won't work without paying." This sentence caused trouble. The fellow wanted to beat him, and the shop assistants had to intercede repeatedly. Zuo Xinru also said repeatedly: "Sir, we are shop assistants, if you don't pay, we have no way to explain to the owner." The more he said, the fiercer the fellow became. Seeing that the situation was not right, Zuo Xinru took the opportunity to slip away. That night at ten o'clock, the fellow came to the counter to make trouble again. The next day, the owner saw Zuo Xinru and said: "Good boy, you have caused me trouble, but you are fine." Before Zuo Xinru could open his mouth, the owner said: "Get out of here, I can't afford to hire you."
    Zuo Xinru lost his job again. In the old society, he was forced to run around, and he couldn't feed himself, so of course he couldn't take care of his wife and children.
    The dark night finally came to an end. After the national liberation, Zuo Xinru turned over. His family was allocated five mu and seven fen of land, his wife joined the mutual aid group, and life slowly improved. He can get more than 600,000 yuan in salary every month. In addition to using it himself, he can also send some home. Now, Zuo Xinru is a representative to the Qianmen District People's Congress. He thinks about the past, looks at the present, and thinks about the bright future, and says: "In the past, people like me who wandered around had no freedom of speech. Today, I have become a people's representative and have the right to manage state affairs. How can I not work hard and support our draft constitution with practical actions!"

    人民获得了当家作主的权利
    做学徒的出了头
    康绍彝是北京市私营五一铁工厂的工会主席。他从小失去了父母，十二岁就在一家私营铁工厂里做学徒，受尽了压迫和折磨。
    每天天一亮，他就爬起来，一直干到夜晚十二点。除了打铁，他还要做饭、挑水、收拾屋子，……。他终年吃不饱、穿不暖，住的是狗窝一样不透气的小屋子。挨打受骂更是常事，老板一生气，上来就是几个嘴巴子；气大时，就抡起打铁的锤子往他身上抡。有一次，他不小心把铁烧过了火，老板就用烧红的铁棍打得他满身是伤。在深冬腊月，刮着西北风的夜晚，他常常跑远道去挑水，有时一不小心在冰地上滑倒了，半天都起不来。四年以后，他当了工人，每月也只赚得十四斤小米。北京解放的前一年，因为吃不饱，他就白天做工，晚上出去蹬三轮。但是就这样也还是受够了气。有一次，在护国寺街道上，一个国民党军官不小心撞上了他的三轮，那家伙竟蛮不讲理，跑上来打了他好几个耳光，国民党警察也跑过来骂他：“他妈的，你们这等人就没有一个好人。”
    现在的日子可就完全不同了。他笑着说：“同志，你们可别笑我。那时我连衣服都穿不上，现在，我完全变了样。瞧！我身上穿得挺整齐的，我还用工资买了一只手表和一辆全新的自行车呢！比起那时，这生活怎么不让我高兴！”
    解放后，康绍彝在党的帮助下，政治觉悟有了提高。他积极地参加了三反、五反运动，向资本家的偷工减料等违法行为进行了坚决的斗争。后来他又发动工人积极搞好生产，并组织工人参加工厂的经营管理，大大改善了工厂的生产情况。这次他当选了人民代表，参加了崇文区第一届第一次人民代表大会会议。学习宪法草案以后，他的干劲更足了。用他自己的话来说：“我是个私营工厂的工人，现在又负责工会工作。人民信任我，选我当代表，我一定要拿出工人当家作主的气魄来，在自己的工作岗位上给人民和国家办事：帮助工人同志们提高生产积极性，发动工人群众监督和帮助资本家走国家资本主义的道路。积极改善工厂的经营管理，发挥私营企业在国民经济中的积极作用。
    老三轮工人谢宏当选为市代表
    今年一月间，老三轮工人谢宏在北京前门区海北寺街派出所的选区当选为区人民代表。他两手颤抖地接过了当选证书，看了又看，摸了又摸，他眼圈润湿了。他说：“要不是共产党毛主席，我谢宏那能有今天。”
    谢宏今年四十九岁，生下四个月时就死了父亲。母亲带着他和哥哥、姊姊，没有办法生活，就把姊姊送了人。他十来岁时，看见别家的小孩子上学，也想念书，但是念了几天就念不起了。十六岁时他在一家啤酒公司当学徒，本来五年期满，但只学了三年多，就被解雇了。谢宏没有办法，只好去拉车挣碗饭吃。
    在旧社会里拉车的人，处处受别人的气，经常挨打。谢宏说：“有一次我拉到一个地点，客人还没有给钱，警察就要轰我走。我说了一句话，警察凶狠地说：你还强嘴！他没头没脸地打得我上半身青一块紫一块，腿也碰坏了，跛了十几天。就这还得拉车。不干活就吃不上饭。”
    北京解放后不久，三轮工人组织了工会。谢宏有了自己的组织，有了说话的地方，他高兴极了。他被选为工会小组长。一九五一年，他又被海北寺街群众选为治安委员和街道宣传员。人逢喜事精神爽，谢宏越干越有劲。他开始组织了一个读报组，白天蹬车，晚上回来给大家读报，讲时事。在镇压反革命、抗美援朝、三反、五反等政治运动中，谢宏总是白天黑夜地忙着。他在胡同里办了一个黑板报。有时候他蹬半天三轮，就跑回来写黑板报，画漫画，晚上还照常读报。
    去年普选时，谢宏更忙起来。一天晚上，胡同里好几个妇女去访问他，说：我们海北寺街群众选你当区人民代表大会代表。谢宏一听就楞住了，半天才说出了一句话：“我能办什么事？”妇女们一致称赞他为群众服务的精神。谢宏又兴奋，又不安，
  一夜没有睡着。
    谢宏不仅当选了前门区区人民代表大会的代表和区人民法院的陪审员，最近在前门区第一届第一次区人民代表大会会议上，又被选为市人民代表大会代表。谢宏说：“宪法草案上规定了全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关。我这次被选为市人民代表大会代表，不久就要去参加市人民代表大会会议，选举全国人民代表大会代表。群众这样信任我，我一定要多多搜集群众的意见，完成群众交给我的任务。”
    人民警察的荣誉
    在东单区的人民代表中，有一个人民警察，名叫姚荣华。他今年才二十岁。
    去年一月间，姚荣华从公安干部学校被调到派出所，领导上给他分配了一个责任区，他就设法去和群众保持密切的联系。
    雨季里，有些居民的住屋常常倒塌。所以，不管白天、夜晚，天一落雨，姚荣华就怎么样也在所里呆不住了。一天傍晚，大雨滂沱，他估计到南小街牌楼馆四号郭老太太家的住屋可能出危险。这位年轻的人民警察就在郭老太太的家门口出现了。这时，院里的水越来越多，眼看就要涌进南屋，老太太一个人正在北屋里发愁。姚荣华知道院里有暗沟，就毫不犹豫地卷起裤子，冒着雨下水掏开了沟，使快进屋的雨水慢慢地泄去。
    姚荣华全身淋得像个落汤鸡，笑嘻嘻地站在郭老太太的面前。老太太感动地说：“姚同志！说老实话，过去警察遇到下雨时，都是急着躲雨，可从没看到像你这样的。时代不同了，警察也成了人民自己的了。”
    最近，他参加东单区首届人民代表大会会议讨论了宪法草案。他举出自己亲身经过的一件事实说：“宪法草案是革命先烈的鲜血写成的。一九四七年的涞水战役时，他是村里的儿童团长，他和别的孩子们、妇女们一道去前线慰问过伤员。许多伤员从前线被运往后方，他们虽然流着血，却面无难色，总还是关心着前线的胜利。宪法草案记录了这些战士和全国人民取得的胜利成果，谁能说宪法草案是轻易得来的？”
    姚荣华曾在森茂皮鞋店里度过了四年多的学徒生活。他在店里每天给老板搭铺、做饭、倒夜壶，稍一不对，就要挨打受骂。北京快解放的时候，国民党叫每家商店都出人去朝阳门外挖战壕。老板眼看他的手已化了脓，却还硬派他去。结果，他一只右胳臂肿了起来，动弹不得。他和老板商量，要去看病，老板说：“你有钱自己去治！”那时正是冬天，他感到又痛又冷。
    解放了，苦日子才熬到了头。姚荣华和许多青年徒工一样，第一批加入了工会。他在一九五二年又进了公安干部学校。他说：“现在和过去比起来，真是天上地下。”
      一个店员的回忆
    左信如是北京前门区庆颐堂药店的店员、前门区店员工作委员会副主任。他说：“现在，我们可以和经理平起平坐，一起商量事情，还可以给经理提意见，在过去那是做梦也想不到的。我从十六岁就开始了店员生活，一连走了五家药店。那时候为了饭碗，虽然勤勤恳恳地干活，结果还是常常无故被解雇。”
    讲到这里，他回忆起了自己二十年店员生活中的一件事。一九四三年，左信如被迫跑到热河，求亲拜友，好容易在北京宏达堂承德分号当了店员。一天，一个国民党特务分子到柜上买药不给钱。左信如是一个店员，怎么敢不要钱呢？那家伙脸一翻说：“你知道我是谁？”左信如说：“不管你是谁，我们是做买卖的，不给钱不成。”这一句话可惹了祸。那家伙要打他，伙计们只得连连给说好话。左信如也再三说：“老总，我们是当伙计的，你不给钱，我们没有办法向掌柜交代。”越说那家伙越凶。看见势头不对，左信如找个机会溜走了。当夜里十
  一点多钟，那家伙又到柜上找麻烦。第二天掌柜看见左信如就说：“好小子，你给我闯下祸，你倒没事了。”没等左信如开口，掌柜又说：“你给我滚蛋，我雇不起你。”
    左信如就这样又一次丢掉了饭碗。在旧社会，他被迫东奔西跑，自己吃不饱饭，当然对老婆、孩子也就没法照顾。
    黑夜终于到头了。全国解放以后，左信如翻了身。他家里分到五亩七分地，老婆参加了互助组，生活也就慢慢好起来。他每月可拿到六十多万元薪金，除了自己用，还可以寄给家里一点。现在，左信如是前门区人民代表大会代表。他想想过去，看看现在，再想想美好的将来，说：“过去像我这样四处流浪的人，连说话的自由都没有，今天竟然当了人民代表，有权管理国家大事，我怎能不好好工作，用实际行动来拥护我们的宪法草案呢！”
