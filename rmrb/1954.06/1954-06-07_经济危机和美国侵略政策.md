    Economic Crisis and US Aggression Policy
    Tan Wenrui
    Since August 1953, the US economic crisis has been developing significantly. Industrial production has declined month by month, and by February of this year, the production index had fallen from 137 in July last year to 124. Eisenhower had pinned his hopes on the seasonal upturn in March, expecting an improvement in business conditions in this "critical month." However, the economic situation in March further deteriorated. According to official US statistics, the industrial production index in March fell again from 124 in February to 123, a decrease of 14 points, or 10.2 percent, compared to July last year. This decline in production has affected all basic industrial sectors, with the steel industry being the most severely affected. Due to the reduction and closure of factories and mines, the number of unemployed has reached a new peak. According to unofficial estimates, the number of unemployed exceeded five million in March.
    Currently, the US propaganda machine is making a big fuss about the temporary halt in production decline in April, attempting to use this to calm people's minds. But this still cannot hide the anxiety of the US monopoly capitalist groups about the economic future.
    It is precisely because of this that the US ruling clique, cornered by the economic crisis, is urgently pursuing new military adventures and intensifying the creation of international tension, in order to use large military orders and the stimulating factor of "military speculation" to save the economic crisis. The war-mongering outbursts of Washington's diplomats and generals illustrate this point.
    The US "Business Week" reported on May 22:
  “Washington is willing to risk a hot war (referring to the expanded intervention in the Indochina war). … The trend is towards intervention.” Therefore, “it is now possible to foresee in general, rather than in detail, some of the commercial effects of involvement in the war.” What effects? "Business Week" said:
  "Currently, they (Washington's defense policymakers) estimate that an additional $10 billion or even $15 billion in arms demand can be added," "A full mobilization plan is being formulated," so "the threat of a new hot war and the increase in military spending may trigger a buying spree. This buying spree may be temporary, but it will most likely cause sharp price increases for many kinds of goods."
    Not only that, the US "economist" Baiberson published an article in the "Journal of Commerce and Financial Chronicle" on May 6, saying that "military speculation" had already begun and caused "the recent rise in stock prices." Baiberson nakedly reflected the US ruling clique's despicable intention to create bloody deals. He complained that "seeking a solution to the Far East issue through negotiation has led to a decline in stock prices." Then he shamelessly said: "We will do this: soldiers from Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and other directly related neighboring countries will wage war, and we will supply weapons. This will help adjust commodity prices, increase employment, and enable the Republicans to win the congressional elections in November of this year."
    This proves all too clearly why the US ruling clique is so afraid of peace and afraid of consultation, stubbornly obstructs and undermines the Geneva Conference, and is keen on engaging in "united actions," piecing together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and is bent on "internationalizing" the Indochina war.
    The US ruling clique's intensifying the creation of international tension in order to pursue the war profits of the monopoly capitalist groups has aroused the unease of the people and governments of various countries and has been met with increasing opposition.
    At the same time, the increasingly significant impact of the US economic crisis on the world capitalist economy has also sharpened the contradictions between the United States and all countries that value their own interests. Capitalist countries have expressed increasing concern about the development of the US economic crisis. British and other Western European newspapers fully reflect this sentiment. The British "Daily Herald" quoted economic experts at the beginning of this year, warning: "Based on the experience of past US 'recessions,' a mere 3 or 4 percent cut in US production would reduce our dollar earnings by 20 or even 30 percent. As things stand, our dollar earnings are not sufficient. Such a large reduction in dollar earnings will have very serious implications for Britain." According to preliminary materials published by the British "Economist" magazine, Britain's exports to the United States in the first quarter of this year decreased by 4 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and by 15 percent compared with the second and third quarters of last year, when Britain's exports to the United States were at their highest. The British Board of Trade pointed out that this sharp drop in exports "is largely due to the continuous decline in US industrial production for several months."
    The US monopoly capitalist groups are trying to shift the economic crisis to other capitalist countries. It is well known that the United States has been implementing a selfish "sell but not buy" trade policy since World War II. Now, the extremely selfish US monopolists are even more unscrupulously excluding foreign goods from the US market, while intensifying the dumping of US surplus goods abroad. Eisenhower's message to the US Congress at the end of March regarding foreign economic policy showed that the United States will continue to build high tariff barriers; US lawmakers are also brewing the passage of so-called bills to protect US industries from the harm of imports, making it more difficult for other capitalist countries to sell goods to the United States. In fact, the recent US import volume has decreased quarter by quarter. On the other hand, these countries are threatened by the large-scale dumping of US goods. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on March 22, "The US government is preparing to launch the largest agricultural product export campaign in world history, the overall purpose of which is to export more agricultural products to foreign countries to reduce the surplus agricultural products in the United States." US Foreign Aid Administrator Stassen recently even openly announced that the US government will use so-called "foreign aid" to dump surplus agricultural products. Argentina's "La Prensa" recently criticized the US dumping policy, saying that the US dumping threatens the economic stability of Latin American and other continents that export agricultural products (Canada, Australia, the Union of South Africa, and New Zealand), and it pointed out that "Argentina's economy has never been threatened by such obvious and serious deceptive competition as it is now."
    Therefore, many capitalist countries are increasingly feeling the harm of continuing to follow US foreign policy to their own interests and are actively taking measures to avoid the transfer of the US economic crisis to them. The main aspect of this active measure is to get rid of the shackles of the US economic blockade and trade restriction policy and strive to restore and develop international trade. The meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers held in Sydney at the beginning of this year focused on discussing how to protect the Commonwealth from the impact of the US economic crisis. The meeting showed that expanding trade with the countries of the peaceful democratic camp would improve their own economic situation, and the meeting communiqué clearly stated: "We must not ignore any market, and we must develop our export trade to all possible places."
    This call for expanding East-West trade is also rising in other capitalist countries. The Secretary-General of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, Macjorin, also pointed out: "One of the most important steps that European countries can take together to mitigate the impact of the US economic depression is to expand and consolidate the unified European market."
    The desire of capitalist countries to develop East-West trade has been supported by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. As is well known, the countries of the peaceful democratic camp have always advocated the restoration and development of normal international trade and believe that expanding economic ties between countries will help promote the relaxation of international tension.
    The US ruling clique is doing its best to use various hypocritical words and unreasonable excuses to cover up its selfish foreign policy and economic expansion policy, trying to make people unable to see its actual intention to create new wars, drive others to take chestnuts from the fire for it, and strengthen its control and monopoly of the capitalist world market in order to maintain the high profits of the US monopoly capitalist groups. However, this clumsy means has become increasingly difficult to succeed. The US ruling clique's intensifying the implementation of its aggressive policy will not only fail to save the economic crisis, but will only make the United States increasingly isolated internationally and its political and economic status increasingly lowered.

    经济危机和美国侵略政策
    谭文瑞
    自一九五三年八月以来，美国经济危机显著地发展着。工业生产逐月下降，到今年二月，生产指数已从去年七月的一三七下降到一二四。艾森豪威尔曾把希望寄托在三月份的季节性上面，期待在这个“关键性的月份”企业情况会有好转。但是结果三月份的经济情况却是进一步恶化。根据美国官方的统计，三月份的工业生产指数再从二月的一二四下降到一二三，和去年七月比较生产指数已下降了十四点，达百分之十点二。这种生产下降的现象已波及各基本工业部门，其中尤以钢铁工业的情况最为严重。由于各厂矿的减产和倒闭，失业人数达到了新的高峰，据非官方估计，三月份失业者已超过五百万。
    目前，美国宣传机器对四月份生产暂时停止下降的现象大事渲染，企图借以安定人心。但这依然不能掩饰美国垄断资本集团对经济前途的焦虑。
    正是因为这样，被经济危机逼到墙角的美国统治集团，正在迫切地追求新的军事冒险，加紧制造国际紧张局势，以便用大量的军事订货和“军事投机”的刺激因素来挽救经济危机。华盛顿的外交家和将军们战争狂的大发作，就说明了这一点。
    五月二十二日的美国“商业周刊”报道说：
  “华盛顿愿意干冒一场热战（指扩大干涉印度支那战争）的危险。……趋势是走向干涉”。因此，“目前已能一般地而不是详细地预见到卷入战争对于商业的某些影响”。什么影响呢？“商业周刊”说：
  “目前他们（华盛顿的国防决策者）估计可以再增加一百亿甚至一百五十亿美元的军火需求”，“全面动员计划正在制定之中”，这样，“新的热战的威胁以及军事费用的增加可能引起一场抢购。这种抢购可能是暂时的，但这多半将引起许多种货物的价格猛烈上涨。”
    不仅这样，美国“经济学家”拜柏逊在五月六日的“商业与金融纪事报”上发表文章说，“军事投机”已经开始，并引起了“最近股票价格的上涨”。拜柏逊露骨地反映了美国统治集团准备制造血腥的交易的卑鄙意图。他抱怨“以谈判方式谋求远东问题的解决已导致股票价格的下跌”。然后他竟不知羞耻地说：“我们将会这样做：由朝鲜、菲律宾、澳大利亚及其他直接有关的邻国的士兵进行战争，由我们供给武器。这将有助于调整商品的价格、扩大就业人数并可以使共和党人在今年十一月国会选举中获胜。”
    这就再清楚不过地证明了，美国统治集团为什么那样地害怕和平，害怕协商，顽固地阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议，而热中于搞“联合行动”，拼凑东南亚侵略集团，一心要把印度支那战争“国际化”。
    美国统治集团为了追求垄断资本集团的战争利润，加紧制造国际紧张局势，已经引起了各国人民和政府的不安，并遭到日益加强的反对。
    同时，美国经济危机对资本主义世界经济的日益显著的影响，也使美国与所有重视自己利益的国家之间的矛盾日益尖锐化。资本主义各国对美国经济危机的发展，表示日益深切的忧虑。英国及其他西欧国家的报纸充分反映了这个情绪。英国“每日先驱报”今年年初就曾引用经济专家的话提出警告说：“根据美国过去历次‘衰退’的经验，美国生产只要削减百分之三或百分之四，便会使得我们的美元收入减少百分之二十，甚至百分之三十。按照目前的情况，我们的美元收入并不足够。美元收入减少这样多将对英国有非常严重的影响。”根据英国
  “经济学家”杂志发表的初步材料，今年第一季英国对美国的出口比去年第四季减少了百分之四，比去年英国对美国输出最多的第二、第三季度减少了百分之十五。英国贸易部指出，这种输出额的急遽跌落，“很大程度上是由于美国工业生产若干月来的一直下降”。
    美国垄断资本集团正在力图把经济危机转嫁到其他资本主义国家的身上。人所共知，美国在第二次世界大战后就一直实行着一种损人利己的“卖而不买”的贸易政策。现在，极端自私的美国垄断资本家更加不顾一切地要把外国货物排斥出美国市场，同时加紧向国外倾销美国的过剩商品。艾森豪威尔三月底向美国国会提出的关于对外经济政策的咨文，表明美国将继续高筑关税壁垒；美国议员且在酝酿通过所谓保护美国工业不受进口危害的法案，使其他资本主义国家向美国销售商品遭遇更大的困难。实际上最近美国的进口额已一季比一季减少。另一方面，这些国家受到美国商品大量倾销的威胁有加无已。据合众社华盛顿三月二十二日消息，“美国政府在准备着开展全世界历史上空前最大的一次农产品外销运动，总的目的是要向外国多输出一些农产品，以减少美国本国过剩的农产品。”美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生不久以前甚至公开宣布美国政府将利用所谓“对外援助”来倾销过剩农产品的计划。阿根廷的“新闻日报”最近就抨击美国的倾销政策说：美国的倾销威胁着拉丁美洲和其他大陆上输出农产品的国家（加拿大、澳大利亚、南非联邦和新西兰）的经济稳定，它并指出
  “阿根廷的经济从来也没有像现在这样遭到如此明显，如此严重的欺骗性的竞争的威胁”。
    因此，许多资本主义国家愈来愈感到继续追随美国外交政策对自己的危害性，并在积极采取措施来避免美国经济危机对它们的转嫁。这种积极措施之主要方面，就是摆脱美国经济封锁和限制贸易的政策的束缚，力求恢复和发展国际贸易。英联邦各国财政部长今年年初在悉尼举行的会议，就是把讨论如何保护英联邦不受美国经济危机打击作为中心的议题。会议表明要与和平民主阵营国家扩大贸易来改善自己的经济处境，会议公报明白表示：“我们是决不能忽视任何市场的，我们必须向一切可能的地方发展我们的出口贸易。”
    这种要求扩展东西方贸易的呼声，在其他资本主义国家中也日益高涨。欧洲经济合作局秘书长麦乔林也指出：“欧洲国家为了缓和美国经济萧条的冲击，可以联合采取的一个最重要的步骤，就是扩大和巩固欧洲的统一市场。”
    资本主义国家要求发展东西方贸易的愿望，获得了苏联和各人民民主国家的支持。众所周知，和平民主阵营各国一向主张恢复和发展正常的国际贸易，并且认为扩大各国间的经济联系有助于促使国际紧张局势的缓和。
    美国统治集团竭力使用各种伪善的言辞和无理的借口，来掩盖它的损人利己的外交政策和经济扩张政策，企图使人看不到它为了维持美国垄断资本集团的高度利润，不惜制造新战争，驱使他人替它火中取栗，以及加强它对资本主义世界市场的控制和垄断的实际意图。但是，这种拙劣手段已愈来愈难以得逞了。美国统治集团加紧推行侵略政策，不仅不能挽救经济危机，而且只有使得美国在国际上日益陷于孤立，它的政治经济地位日益降低了。
