Shaoshan—Mangyongdae
—A Record of the Visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China to Chairman Mao's Hometown
Zhang Xianyou, Tian Fangmu, Guang Yu

May 30th was an unforgettable day. The envoys of the heroic people—the Korean People's Delegation to China and the accompanying art troupe—visited Shaoshan, the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

That day, the sky cleared after the rain. When the mountains around Shaoshan were still immersed in a white morning mist, the people of Shaoshan were already busy. The gates of the Shaoshan Guest House and Shaoshan School were decorated with a new look, with large banners written in both Chinese and Korean characters hanging on the gates: "Welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China." The national flags of China, Korea, and the Soviet Union fluttered in the morning breeze. "...Today, the glorious garland of free Korea shines with a sacred light..." This was the joyful singing of "General Kim Il-sung's Song" by the children of Shaoshan School. Before nine o'clock, a crowd of welcomers had gathered in front of the Shaoshan Guest House. Among them were Wang Shulan, the widow of martyr Mao Zemin and an old Communist Party member; Mao Yueqiu, a seventy-year-old veteran Communist Party member who had persisted in underground revolutionary struggle for more than twenty years; Liu Xiuhua, the wife of Volunteer Army soldier Mao Zhiming and the director of the Shaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative; and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and young girls in festive attire. They came to greet their long-awaited relatives with infinite joy. Among the welcomers was Mao Renqiu, the secretary of the Shaoshan Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, who had represented the people of Shaoshan on the National People's Delegation to Korea in 1952 to慰问 the Korean and Chinese People's Army and the Korean people. In Korea, he witnessed the heroic struggle of the Korean people and received their deep affection and hospitality. He remembered very clearly that on the day of their departure from Korea, a combat hero of the People's Army said to him at the farewell: "After the victory, I will definitely strive to go to China to see, and definitely visit Chairman Mao's hometown. Then, we will meet in Shaoshan." Now, these envoys of the heroic people are coming, how could he not be excited! At more than ten o'clock in the morning, the relatives arrived. At this time, the entire Shaoshan, surrounded by mountains, boiled over. The welcoming crowd raised a wave of enthusiastic cheers of "Long Live Mao Zedong—Kim Il-sung!" Four Young Pioneers wearing red scarves ran over with bright flowers and presented them to the head and deputy head of the delegation. They raised their hands to salute the Korean uncles who defended their happy childhood. Liu Xiuhua, the wife of Volunteer Army soldier Mao Zhiming, saw these heroic envoys of the Korean people as if she saw the close brothers who had lived and fought with her husband and warmly helped and cared for him. She really wanted to run up to greet the representatives and say a few words of gratitude. But at this moment, she was so excited that she couldn't say a word. She just silently followed the representatives, carefully looking at their faces and their clothes. She wanted to clearly see and remember everything about these relatives from afar.

Mao Huachu, secretary of the Xiangtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, expressed a warm welcome to the delegation and introduced the life of the people of Shaoshan after liberation and the struggle they waged for the construction of the motherland and for resisting America and aiding Korea. Indeed, the people of Shaoshan deeply understand the relationship between their increasingly happy life since liberation and the heroic and arduous struggle of the Korean people. In the past, the mothers and daughters of Shaoshan sent their sons and husbands to the front lines in Korea because they knew that their happiness was linked to the happiness of the Korean people. That year, when the General Association for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued a call for the people of the whole country to actively donate airplanes and cannons to support the struggle of the Korean people, the people of Shaoshan worked hard, increased production, and donated more than 32,000 jin of rice to purchase airplanes and cannons. But what is this compared to the sacrifices and contributions of the Korean people in the war? Therefore, the people of the entire Shaoshan have a common wish: in the future, they must make even greater efforts to increase grain production, support the construction of the motherland, and support the construction of the Korean people.

During the break, Mao Huachu, Wang Shulan, Mao Yueqiu, and head of the delegation Kim Ung-gi sat together, and they narrated the stories of Chairman Mao's childhood to head of the delegation Kim Ung-gi. They talked intimately like family members who had reunited after a long separation. Then, the delegation and the people of Shaoshan exchanged gifts as souvenirs. The Korean People's Delegation to China presented the people of Shaoshan with ninety-eight photos of Marshal Kim Il-sung and three hundred commemorative badges. The people of Shaoshan also gave many gifts to the Korean friends. Among them was five volumes of "Shaoshan Photo Album" presented by Mao Renqiu on behalf of the Shaoshan Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, reflecting the historical relics of the revolutionary struggle in Shaoshan Township. Head of the delegation Kim Ung-gi repeatedly expressed his deep gratitude to the people of Shaoshan. At this time, several Young Pioneers wearing red scarves met Choi Űn-hŭi. They gave Choi Űn-hŭi various gifts they had prepared, such as schoolbags, ping-pong paddles, and pen cases, and asked him to pass them on to the Korean children. He Haiqing, a thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer and the younger brother of a Volunteer Army soldier, said excitedly: "Brother Choi Űn-hŭi, I am very happy to see you. I have two elder brothers, the eldest is in the Volunteer Army, and the second is in the People's Liberation Army. I must study hard and train my body well, and be prepared to build the motherland, defend the motherland, and defend peace." After saying this, he took off his red scarf and tied it on Choi Űn-hŭi. After they hugged each other for a long time, Choi Űn-hŭi also said excitedly: "Seeing the children of Chairman Mao's hometown is as close as seeing my own brothers. Although the Korean children and the Shaoshan children are far apart, their hearts are always connected. I hope we can communicate more in the future and use letters to connect and express the feelings of the youth of our two countries." The Young Pioneers of Shaoshan School handed the letters they wrote to the children of Mangyongdae, the hometown of Marshal Kim Il-sung, to Choi Űn-hŭi on the spot and asked him to take them with him. They hoped to establish a long-term communication relationship with the children of Kim Il-sung's hometown through this letter. Yes, although Shaoshan and Mangyongdae are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, they are so close to each other in people's hearts. The seeds of peace and friendship will continue to grow and sprout in the hearts of the youth of Shaoshan and Mangyongdae, and bloom beautiful flowers.

After the break, the delegation and all members of the art troupe visited Chairman Mao's former residence and the Mao Family Ancestral Hall with infinite respect. They lingered for a long time in Chairman Mao's study and bedroom in his youth. They felt particularly cordial to the books Chairman Mao used to read and the things he used. Here, they saw photos of Chairman Mao in his childhood and youth, photos of Chairman Mao in the "May Fourth" era, and also saw the "Xiangjiang Review" once sponsored by Chairman Mao. They were particularly interested in every tree and grass in Chairman Mao's hometown. They constantly praised the beautiful scenery of this Chinese countryside bathed in sunlight: the green mountains surrounding it like a barrier, the clear flowing water in the mountains, the green fields in the distance and near, and the brilliant wildflowers exuding fragrance. All this strongly attracted them. The famous Korean artist Gil Jin-seop meticulously painted a panoramic view of Chairman Mao's former residence into his album.

It was afternoon, and in order to return to Changsha that day, the representatives had to bid farewell to Shaoshan with reluctance. At this time, the people who saw them off became excited again. How short was the rare meeting! When the representatives' cars drove out of sight, the people who saw them off were still gazing at the distance on the highway.

    韶山——万景台
    ——记朝鲜人民访华代表团访问毛主席故乡
    张先友　田放牧　光羽
    五月三十日，这是一个令人难忘的日子，英雄人民的使者——朝鲜人民访华代表团和同行的艺术团来到我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席的故乡韶山访问了。
    这一天，雨后初晴。当韶山周围的群山还浸沉在一片白茫茫的晨雾里，韶山的人们就忙碌起来了。韶山招待所、韶山学校的大门打扮得焕然一新，门上悬挂着用中朝两国文字写着的大幅标语：“欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团”，中、朝、苏三国国旗在晨风中招展。“……今天自由朝鲜光荣花环上，灿烂地放射着神圣光芒……”，这是韶山学校的孩子们在练习“金日成将军之歌”的愉快的歌声。不到九点钟，韶山招待所门前就聚集起了欢迎的人群。这里有毛泽民烈士的爱人、老共产党员王淑兰，有七十多岁曾经坚持地下革命斗争二十多年的老共产党员毛月秋、有志愿军毛志铭的爱人——韶山农业生产合作社社长刘秀华，也有系着红领巾的少年先锋队队员们和穿着节日盛装的年轻的姑娘们，他们带着无限欣喜的心情来迎接自己久盼的亲人。欢迎的人群中，还有中共韶山乡支部书记毛仁秋，他在一九五二年曾经代表韶山人民参加全国人民赴朝慰问团到朝鲜慰问过朝中人民军队和朝鲜人民。在朝鲜，他亲眼看到了朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，也受到了朝鲜人民深情厚意的接待，他记得很清楚，离开朝鲜的那天，一位人民军的战斗英雄送别他们的时候对他说：“等到胜利以后，我一定争取到中国去看看，一定到毛主席的故乡去拜访，那时，我们在韶山见。”现在，这些英雄人民的使者就要来了，他怎么能不兴奋呢！上午十点多，亲人们来到了。这时，群山环抱的全韶山沸腾起来了，欢迎的人群中扬起一片“毛泽东——金日成万岁”的热烈的欢呼声，四个系着红领巾的少年先锋队员捧着鲜艳的花朵飞跑过去，将花献给代表团团长和副团长，他们举手向保卫了他们幸福的童年的朝鲜伯伯、叔叔致敬。志愿军毛志铭的爱人刘秀华看到了这些英雄的朝鲜人民的使者，就像看到了那些和她丈夫在一起生活过，战斗过，热情地帮助和照顾过她丈夫的亲兄弟一样，她真想立刻跑上去向代表们问个好，说几句感谢的话。但是，这时，她激动得一句话也说不出来，她只是默默地跟随在代表们的身边，仔细地看着他们的面孔、他们的衣服，她要好好儿把这些远方的亲人们的一切都看清楚，记清楚。
    中共湘潭县委书记毛华初对代表团表示了热烈的欢迎，并且向代表们介绍了韶山人民解放后的生活和为了建设祖国，为了抗美援朝所做的斗争。的确，韶山人民深深懂得：解放以后的一天好似一天的幸福生活和朝鲜人民的英勇艰苦斗争的关系。过去，韶山的母亲们和姑娘们把自己的儿子和爱人送到朝鲜前线，就是因为他们知道自己的幸福和朝鲜人民的幸福是连在一起的。那年，抗美援朝总会发出号召，要全国人民踊跃捐献飞机大炮支援朝鲜人民的斗争时，韶山人民辛勤劳动，增产捐献了三万二千多斤稻谷，购买飞机大炮。但是，这比起朝鲜人民在战争中的牺牲和贡献又算得什么呢？因此，全韶山人民有一个共同的心愿：今后，要尽更大的努力，增产粮食，支持祖国的建设，支持朝鲜人民的建设。
    在休息中，毛华初、王淑兰、毛月秋和金应基团长坐在一块，他们向金应基团长叙述着毛主席少年时代的故事，他们就像久别重聚的家人一样亲切地倾谈着。接着，代表团和韶山人民互相赠送了礼物，留作纪念。朝鲜人民访华代表团送给韶山人民九十八张金日成元帅的照片和三百个纪念章。韶山人民也送给朝鲜友人许多礼品。其中有毛仁秋代表中共韶山乡支部送的反映韶山乡革命斗争史迹的五本“韶山影集”。代表团金应基团长一再表示对韶山人民深深的感谢。这时几个戴着红领巾的少年先锋队员和崔?会面了。他们把自己准备好的书包、乒乓球拍、钢笔套等各种礼物交给崔?，请他转送给朝鲜小朋友。志愿军战士的弟弟、十三岁的少年先锋队员贺海清激动地说：“崔?哥哥，我见到了你，非常高兴，我有两个哥哥，大哥是志愿军，二哥是解放军。我一定要好好学习，把身体锻炼好，准备着建设祖国，保卫祖国，保卫和平。”说完，他就把自己的红领巾取下来给崔?系上，在他们两个长久地拥抱后、崔?也激动地说：“见到毛主席故乡的小朋友，就和亲兄弟一样亲。朝鲜小朋友和韶山小朋友虽然相距很远，但彼此的心是永远连在一起的，我希望我们今后多多通讯，用书信来联系和表达我们两国少年的感情。”韶山学校的少年先锋队员当场把他们写给金日成元帅故乡万景台的小朋友的信交给崔?，请他带去。他们希望通过这封信，和金日成故乡的小朋友长久地建立起通讯关系来。是的，韶山—万景台这两个地方虽然是隔着千山万水，但是，它们在人们的心中却是这样地相亲相近，和平和友谊的种子将在韶山—万景台的少年心中不断生长发芽，开放出美丽的花朵来。
    休息以后，代表团和艺术团全体人员怀着无限崇敬的心情参观了毛主席的故居和毛家祠堂。他们在毛主席少年时代的书房和寝室里停留了许久，他们对毛主席过去读过的书，用过的东西都感到格外亲切。在这里，他们看到了毛主席幼年和少年时代的照片，看到了毛主席在“五四”时代的照片，也看到了毛主席曾经主办的“湘江评论”。他们对毛主席故乡的一草一木都特别感到兴趣，他们不断地赞叹着这个在阳光照耀下的中国农村的秀丽景色：那四周像屏障一样的青翠的山林，那山间的清澈的流水，那远远近近绿色的田野，那散发着芳香的灿烂的野花，这一切都是如此强烈地吸引着他们。朝鲜著名的美术家吉镇燮聚精会神地把毛主席故居的全景画进了画册。
    已是下午了，代表们为了当天赶回长沙，只好带着依依不舍的心情和韶山挥手告别。这时，欢送的人们又激动起来，难得的会见是多么短暂啊！当代表们的汽车开得望不见影子的时候，送别的人们还在凝视着公路的远方。
