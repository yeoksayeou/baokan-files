    Small Factories Can Also Innovate Technically
    Yang Mu
    Some people say: small factories have few people and small machines, so they cannot carry out technological innovations. The local state-owned Hohhot Oil Factory refuted this claim with facts. This oil factory only has thirty-some workers, and before March of this year, it frequently failed to meet its production plan. At that time, the state plan stipulated that each team should produce 492 kilograms of oil per day, but each team could only actually produce 480 kilograms of oil per day.
    The Li Shuangxi team of the factory responded to the leadership's call and carefully inspected the oil press. They found the root cause of the low oil yield: mainly, the sesame seeds stayed in the oil press for too short a time, and were not pressed sufficiently. Why did this happen? After further inspection of various parts of the machine, it was found that this was due to the same width of the inlet and outlet. After the problem was identified, technician Zhang Qingyuan and worker Chai Lin, among others, proposed widening the inlet, thereby relatively narrowing the outlet, which would increase the pressure on the sesame seeds in the machine. The experiment was conducted in the Li Shuangxi team in mid-March, and the results were very good, with the oil output increasing by 10 kilograms per day. Later, all the oil presses in the factory were improved in the same way. From late March, the average hourly output of the factory's oil presses increased from 8 kilograms to 10.9 kilograms; the oil yield increased from 32.8 percent to 34.5 percent, with a maximum of 35 percent. The daily output of each team increased from 480 kilograms to 700 kilograms. The daily output of the entire factory increased from 1,500 kilograms to 2,000 kilograms.
    How valuable is a technological innovation carried out by such a small factory? According to preliminary calculations, it can increase the nation's wealth by more than 2.2 billion yuan from April to December this year.
    This figure is equivalent to the total output value of the entire factory for three months in the past.
    Recently, the factory successfully tested the oil residue re-pressing method, which increased the oil yield from 34.5 percent to an average of 35.5 percent, with a maximum of 37 percent, and it is still filtered pure oil, creating the highest oil yield record of all oil factories in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and also exceeding the oil yield standard stipulated by the North China Oil Industry Conference.

    小工厂也能革新技术
    杨木
    有人说：小工厂人少、机器小，无法进行技术革新。地方国营呼和浩特制油厂用事实否定了这种说法。这个制油厂只有三十来个工人，今年三月以前，经常完不成计划。那时，国家计划规定每小组每天出油四百九十二公斤，但是每小组每天实际只能出油四百八十公斤。
    该厂李双喜小组响应领导上的号召，对榨油机进行了仔细的检查。找出了出油率低的根源：主要是胡麻籽在榨油机内的停留时间太短，压榨的不够。为什么会造成这种情况呢？经过进一步对机器各个部分的检查，查出了这是由于进口和出口的宽度一样而造成的。问题找出以后，技术员张庆远和工人柴林等，提出加宽进口的建议，相对地使出口狭窄了，这样就使胡麻籽在机器中受到的压力加大了。三月中旬在李双喜小组试验，成绩很好，出油量一天增加了十公斤。后来全厂的榨油机就照样改进。从三月下旬起，全厂榨油机每小时产量从八公斤平均提高到十点九公斤；出油率从百分之三十二点八提高到百分之三十四点五，最高达到百分之三十五。小组每天的产量从四百八十公斤提高到七百公斤。全厂每天产量由一千五百公斤增加到两千公斤。
    这样一个小厂所进行的一项技术革新，它的价值有多么大呢？据初步计算，从今年四月至十二月即可为国家增加财富二十二亿多元。
    这个数目字相当于以前全厂三个月生产的总值。
    最近，该厂试验油渣回榨法成功，使出油率由百分之三十四点五又提高到平均百分之三十五点五，最高达到百分之三十七，并且还是滤过的纯油，创造了内蒙古自治区所有油厂的出油最高纪录，也超过了华北油脂工业会议所规定的出油标准。
