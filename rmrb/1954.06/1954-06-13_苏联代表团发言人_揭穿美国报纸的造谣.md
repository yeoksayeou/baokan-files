Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 11th: The TASS news agency in Geneva reported on the 11th that after the nine-nation delegation held a plenary meeting on June 10th, the Soviet delegation held a press conference.

At the meeting, someone asked Ilichev, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the following question: An American newspaper published a message saying that a certain Soviet-Chinese agreement was signed in Moscow on April 12, 1950. What is your opinion on this message?

The spokesman for the Soviet delegation replied:

Yes, I also know about the above message. It was published in the June 9th issue of the Hearst-owned New York "American Journal." This newspaper, based on information from Chinese Kuomintang figures and British sources, insisted that representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China signed an agreement in Moscow on April 12, 1950. This newspaper said that this "document" "stipulated that the Soviet Union would provide military, economic, and ideological guidance to develop China's red republic and expand its borders to all of Asia."

The supposed "agreement" then stated: "Due to the difficulty of lacking materials, the population of the People's Republic of China must be reduced by 100 million, otherwise, there is no way to maintain it."

In commenting on the message published by the New York "American Journal," it must be stated:

First, everything reported by this newspaper is a complete lie, the purpose of which is to deceive readers;

Second, the agreement reported by this newspaper simply does not exist. Only someone who has lost all sense of reality would hope that any sensible person would believe such a shameless fabrication. If the authors of this recent lie hoped to find believers in this slander among the readers, then it is clearly too disrespectful to the readers. This slander was obviously deliberately spread during the Geneva Conference.

    苏联代表团发言人
    揭穿美国报纸的造谣
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社日内瓦十一日讯：在六月十日九国代表团举行全体会议以后，苏联代表团举行了记者招待会。
    会上，有人向苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫提出了下列问题：一家美国报纸登载了一条消息，据说是一九五○年四月十二日在莫斯科签订了某种苏中协定。请问你对这一消息有何意见？
    苏联代表团发言人回答说：
    是的，上述消息我也知道了。它登载在六月九日的美国赫斯特系的纽约“美国人日报”上。这家报纸根据中国国民党人士和英国消息灵通人士那里来的消息，硬说苏联和中华人民共和国代表在一九五○年四月十二日在莫斯科签订了一个协定。这家报纸说，这个“文件”“规定苏联给予军事、经济和思想指导来发展中国的红色共和国、并把它的国境扩大到全亚洲去。”
    这个据说的“协定”接着说：“由于存在着缺少物资的困难，中华人民共和国的居民必须减少一亿，否则就没有法子加以维持。”
    在评论纽约“美国人日报”所发表的这个消息时，必须说明：
    首先，这家报纸报道的一切都是彻头彻尾的谎话，目的是要欺骗读者；
    第二，这家报纸所报道的协定是并无其事的。只有丧失了一切现实感的人，才会希望任何有理智的人会相信这种无耻的捏造。如果最近这次谎言的作者希望在读者中间找到相信这个诬蔑的人，那显然是太不尊重读者了，这种诬蔑显然是有意在日内瓦会议期间散布的。
