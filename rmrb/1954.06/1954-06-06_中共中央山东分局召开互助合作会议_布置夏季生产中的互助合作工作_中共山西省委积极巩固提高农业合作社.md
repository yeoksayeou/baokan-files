    The CCP Central Committee Shandong Branch Convenes Mutual Aid and Cooperation Meeting
    Arranging Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work in Summer Production
    The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee Actively Consolidates and Improves Agricultural Cooperatives
    In mid-May, the CCP Central Committee Shandong Branch convened the province's fourth Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference. In addition to stipulating specific measures for consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the coming period based on the current situation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shandong Province, the conference made detailed arrangements for mutual aid and cooperation work in summer production. The meeting unanimously agreed that consolidating and improving the existing 20,000+ agricultural production cooperatives and 1 million+ permanent and temporary mutual aid teams through summer production is the key to the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations after this autumn. Therefore, first, Party committees at all levels should lead agricultural production cooperatives in doing a good job in the current summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer hoeing, and overcome natural disasters; and improve production efficiency by rationally using labor, identifying key factors for increasing production, and effectively providing technical guidance in production. Second, lead agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in the preliminary distribution of spring income; improve the operation and management of agricultural production cooperatives according to production needs, and rectify and improve the organization of agricultural production cooperatives. Regarding mutual aid teams, the meeting believed that Party committees at all levels should first mobilize them to conduct summary appraisals of spring production, commend achievements, solve problems, and carry out work clearing and settlement, and then help them make mutual aid plans for summer production, thereby doing a good job in summer production. In summer production, it is necessary to help mutual aid teams rationally arrange agricultural work, correctly organize and use labor, democratically resolve contradictions in the order of agricultural work, and study key factors for increasing production. In particular, it is necessary to organize and lead seasonal agricultural work such as summer harvesting, summer planting, and summer hoeing to avoid "June disbandment" and "summer collapse." In order to adapt to the needs of busy summer production, various forms of temporary and seasonal mutual aid teams should be developed, and leadership should be strengthened and gradually improved. In the work of rectifying mutual aid teams, it is necessary to carefully check and implement mutually beneficial policies and strengthen the unity of middle peasants and poor peasants. Party committees at all levels should also cultivate a certain number of perennial mutual aid teams according to the needs of developing agricultural production cooperatives, so as to prepare for establishing cooperatives after autumn.

    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has adopted various concrete measures to further consolidate and improve the province's more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives.

    On the basis of more than 2,000 old cooperatives last year, Shanxi Province established 7,894 new cooperatives this spring. In order to help cooperative members clarify the nature of the cooperative and the guiding principles and policies for running the cooperative, from March to May, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province universally carried out the work of studying the cooperative charter and formulating and revising the cooperative charter. Now, nearly 60% of the cooperatives have revised or formulated their charters. Through studying, formulating, and revising the charter, many specific problems have also been resolved, such as adjusting cooperative affairs cadres, rectifying labor discipline, implementing the principle of distribution according to labor as the main factor, taking care of the interests of cooperative members with more land and less labor, and removing bad elements who had sneaked into the cooperative, thereby enhancing the collectivist ideology and labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members.

    The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee also closely integrated with various agricultural activities, and mobilized agricultural production cooperatives to vigorously rectify labor organizations with the promotion of the contracting experience of advanced cooperatives as the center. According to statistics from more than 5,600 cooperatives in 37 counties including Pingshun, Jiexian, Yuci, and Yanggao, more than 4,900 cooperatives have implemented the contracting system, and a few cooperatives have also implemented the contracting production system, which has played a significant role in completing the spring plowing and sowing tasks and overcoming the chaotic production phenomenon in the early stage of establishing the cooperative. According to the investigation of some typical cooperatives, after rectifying the labor organization, the average newly established agricultural production cooperative generally increased labor efficiency by 10% to 14%; the old cooperatives with a foundation, such as the agricultural production cooperatives led by Li Shunda and Guo Yu'en in Pingshun County, increased labor efficiency by 20% to 30%.

    The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee is now strengthening the consolidation and improvement work of cooperatives with a relatively poor foundation, which account for about 10% of the total number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province; adopting methods such as promoting the experience of advanced cooperatives through the "mutual aid and cooperation network," organizing mutual visits and comparisons, dispatching necessary cadres to carry out rectification, and helping to solve specific difficulties, so as to gradually balance the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. After the sowing of large autumn crops is completed, all localities will conduct a comprehensive inspection and rectification of financial management under leadership, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production, guaranteeing the income of cooperative members, and vigorously saving, tightening non-productive expenditures within the cooperative, overcoming the tendency of blind production and disregard for costs, and further formulating reasonable income and expenditure plans for the entire cooperative and specific plans for summer production investment.

    中共中央山东分局召开互助合作会议
    布置夏季生产中的互助合作工作
    中共山西省委积极巩固提高农业合作社
    中共中央山东分局于五月中旬召开了全省第四次互助合作会议，会上除根据山东省当前互助合作运动情况规定出今后一个时期内巩固和发展互助合作组织的具体办法外，对夏季生产中的互助合作工作作了详细安排。会议一致认为通过夏季生产把现有的二万多个农业生产合作社和一百多万个常年和临时的互助组巩固和提高一步，是今年秋后互助合作组织大发展的关键。因此，首先各级党委应领导农业生产合作社作好当前的夏收、夏种、夏锄工作，战胜自然灾害；并在生产中合理使用劳力、找出增产关键、确实作好技术指导，以提高生产效率。其次，领导农业生产合作社作好春季收益的预分工作；根据生产需要改善农业生产合作社的经营管理，整顿和提高农业生产合作社的组织。对于互助组，会议认为各级党委应首先发动他们进行春季生产的总结评比，表扬成绩，解决问题，进行清工结账，然后帮助他们作出夏季生产的互助计划，从而做好夏季生产工作。在夏季生产中要帮助互助组合理的进行农活排队，正确地组织使用劳力，民主解决农活的先后矛盾，并研究出增产关键。特别要组织和领导好夏收、夏种、夏锄等有时间性的农活，以避免“六月散”和“夏垮台”。为着适应夏季繁忙的生产需要，应发展各种形式的临时和季节性的互助组，并加强领导、逐步提高。在整顿互助组的工作中要认真检查和贯彻互利政策，加强中农和贫农的团结。各级党委并应根据发展农业生产合作社的需要，培养一定数量的常年互助组，为秋后办社做好准备工作。

    中国共产党山西省委员会，采取各种具体措施，使全省一万多个农业生产合作社进一步得到巩固和提高。
    山西省在去年两千多个老社的基础上，今春又建立了新社七千八百九十四个。为了帮助社员明确社的性质、办社的方针政策，在三月至五月间，全省农业生产合作社普遍进行了学习社章和制订、修订社章的工作，现在已有近百分之六十的社修订或制订了社章。通过学习、制订、修订社章，还解决了许多具体问题，如调整了社务干部、整顿了劳动纪律，贯彻了以劳力分红为主的方针，又照顾了土地多劳力少的社员利益，清除了钻进社内的坏分子，从而提高了社员的集体主义思想和劳动积极性。
    中共山西省委还密切结合各项农事活动，发动农业生产合作社以推广先进社的包工经验为中心，大力整顿了劳动组织。据平顺、解县、榆次、阳高等三十七个县的五千六百多个社的统计，已有四千九百多个社实行了包工制，有少数社还实行了包工包产制，对完成春耕播种任务、克服建社初期的生产混乱现象，起了很大作用。据一些典型社的调查：经过整顿劳动组织，一般新建的农业生产合作社，平均提高劳动效率百分之十到十四；有基础的老社，如平顺县李顺达、郭玉恩所领导的农业生产合作社，劳动效率提高了百分之二十到三十。
    中共山西省委现正加强对基础较差的社的巩固提高工作，这些社约占全省农业生产合作社总数的百分之十左右；采用通过“互助合作网”推广先进社的经验、组织相互参观评比、派遣必要的干部进行整顿和帮助解决具体困难等办法，使农业生产互助合作运动逐步走向平衡。在大秋作物播种结束后，各地将有领导地进行一次财务管理的全面检查整顿，根据增加生产、保证社员收入和大力节约的精神，紧缩社内的非生产开支，克服盲目生产、不计成本的偏向，进一步做出全社合理的收支计划和夏季生产投资的具体计划。
