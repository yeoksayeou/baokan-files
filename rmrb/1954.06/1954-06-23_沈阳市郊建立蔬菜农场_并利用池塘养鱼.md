    Vegetable Farms Established in the Suburbs of Shenyang and Ponds Used for Fish Farming
    In order to solve the growing need for non-staple foods for the people of the city, the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry has established a vegetable farm in Gufazi District in the suburbs of the city. Starting this year, fish farming in suburban ponds will also be carried out in a planned manner.
    In one or two years, the vegetable farm will become a new type of semi-mechanized vegetable farm. The vegetable farm plans to open up 1,000 square meters of solar greenhouses in late autumn this year, and build 3,000 square meters of glass greenhouses in the winter. In this way, with artificial control, citizens can still eat fresh peppers, eggplants, cucumbers and other vegetables even in the severe winter.
    In terms of fish farming, since January this year, with the strong assistance of the Northeast Bureau of Agriculture and its affiliated Harbin Aquatic Products Experimental Farm, a pond survey has been conducted in the suburbs. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 220 ponds in 14 districts including Masanjia and Panjiantai, covering an area of 4.49 million square meters. At present, seven ponds have been repaired and newly opened in seven locations in the suburbs such as Daqing, Xiaoyu, and Guanlibao villages, with an area of 100,000 square meters. More than 65,000 carp fry have been released successively. Now the small fish have grown to more than four inches long. This autumn, more than 100,000 silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp, and black carp fry will continue to be released into the above-mentioned ponds.
    Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry transported a total of 300,000 fish fry of various types such as silver carp, bighead carp, grass carp, and black carp from Hankou, and they have been released into the fish ponds of the local state-owned vegetable farm for breeding. It is planned to let the fish fry grow here for a period of time, and then hand them over to the masses for their own breeding. It is expected that in the autumn of next year, the citizens of Shenyang will be able to eat a large number of fresh fish produced by the farmers in the suburbs themselves.

    沈阳市郊建立蔬菜农场
    并利用池塘养鱼
    沈阳市农林局为了解决城市人民对副食品日益增长的需要，已在市郊孤家子区成立了一个蔬菜农场。并从今年开始，有计划地在郊区池塘养鱼。
    一、二年后，蔬菜农场将成为一个半机械化的新型蔬菜农场。蔬菜农场计划在今年晚秋开辟一千平方公尺的阳畦，冬季新建三千平方公尺的玻璃温室，这样由于人工的控制，虽然在严寒的季节里，市民仍然可以吃到新鲜的辣椒、茄子、黄瓜等蔬菜。
    在养鱼方面，自今年一月开始，在东北农业局及其所属哈尔滨水产试验场的大力协助下，已在市郊进行了池塘调查，据初步统计，在马三家、潘建台等十四个区内，共有池塘二百二十余个，面积达四百四十九万余平方公尺，目前，已在市郊大青、小榆、官立堡村等七处，修理和新辟了七个池塘，面积达十万平方公尺，已先后放养了鲤鱼苗六万五千余尾。现在小鱼已长到四寸多长，今年秋季，将继续在上述池塘内放养白鲢、花鲢、草鱼、青鱼等鱼苗十余万尾。
    最近，市农林局又从汉口运到白鲢、花鲢、草鱼、青鱼等各种鱼苗共三十万尾，现已放养在地方国营蔬菜农场的鱼池内进行饲养，准备让鱼苗在这里生长一个时期后，就分别交给群众自己养殖，预计在明年的秋季，沈阳市的市民就可以吃到由市郊农民自己生产出来的大批鲜鱼。（张庆福  张海）
