The experience of the Cuiqiao District in Fugou County, Henan Province, in piloting a new type of national grain market in two market towns (Cuiqiao and Liqiao) proves that establishing a national grain market plays a significant role in stimulating the rural economy and promoting mutual exchange among farmers. This is primarily reflected in the frequent transactions within the market and the increasing amount of grain being brought to market. For example, at the Liqiao market, the first fair saw 691 jin of grain brought to market, of which the state purchased 463 jin, in addition to mutual adjustments made by the people. The amount of grain brought to market at the second fair increased by 105% compared to the first, and the state's purchase volume increased by 115%. At the Cuiqiao market, the first fair saw 1,127 jin of grain brought to market, and subsequently, the amount brought to market at each fair increased to around 2,000 jin. As the amount of grain brought to market increased, the state's grain supply in the area significantly decreased. The district's daily sales volume in early April was 12,000 jin, which decreased to 8,500 jin in mid-April. Due to the active grain market, the amount of cotton brought to market also increased sharply. The district purchased over 3,000 jin in early April and over 5,000 jin in mid-April, an increase of 70%, further stimulating the rural economy.

Farmers welcome this type of grain market. Seeing the difference between the new type of national grain market and the old free market, they actively assist in the management of the market. For example, at the first fair in the Liqiao market, farmers reported a private merchant for rushing to purchase and hoard grain. Farmers in Cuiqiao also reported the illegal behavior of a landlord who was trying to purchase grain by improper means. Farmers said, "Trading and adjusting in the national grain market is convenient for both exchange and trade with reasonable prices. Who would be willing to sell grain to private merchants again?"

The experience of the Cuiqiao District in establishing a national grain market tells us that to establish a new type of national grain market in rural areas, first, district and township cadres must be educated to fully understand the state's grain policy and recognize the necessity of establishing a new type of national grain market. Initially, some district and township cadres in the Cuiqiao District lacked confidence in establishing the market, harboring concerns such as fearing trouble and "inviting ghosts by burning incense," and their resistance was significant. In response to these concerns, the state's grain policy was explained comprehensively, emphasizing the importance of establishing a national grain market in stimulating the economy, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and supplementing the state's supply. The local situation was also analyzed, which greatly educated the cadres. For example, in the district, due to the stagnation of the grain market, some farmers with surplus grain secretly sold grain at dawn or traded in the black market at night (400 jin were traded in Donggu Village in one night). Many farmers lacked food grain because they could not obtain proper free adjustments; some farmers had to grind wheat twice to use it as feed or feed livestock with mung beans because they could not adjust grain seeds. This fueled the activities of black market merchants, and the phenomenon of buying and selling green crops also occurred (Wei Xiaohai's family bought 1,500 jin of green crops at 1,000 yuan per jin). After educating the cadres based on these facts, they began to recognize the necessity and importance of establishing a national grain market, and their confidence increased.

Second, it is necessary to rely on Party and League members, organize village cadres and activists, and conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda, education, and organizational work among mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Emphasize: (1) The state's policy of guaranteeing the supply to grain-deficient households, ensuring that no household or individual is left out. (2) The policy of allowing farmers to sell surplus grain and adjust surpluses and deficiencies after the unified grain purchase. Those who should have sold more but sold less or did not sell during the unified grain purchase are now selling in the market, indicating their increased awareness, which should be welcomed and not discriminated against or suppressed. (3) The purpose, nature, methods of establishing a new type of market, and the benefits of mutual adjustment among the masses. Through propaganda, break down concerns (such as: fearing to be seen as surplus grain households by bringing grain to the market, fearing being accused of violating the law or being dishonest, thinking that selling directly to the state grain store is more honorable and does not interfere with production, etc.). Create an atmosphere where increasing production, selling surplus grain, and adjusting grain are considered honorable. As a result, the masses sold surplus grain in large numbers. For example, Gu Zichun of Yuanzhuang Village sold 2,000 jin of grain during the unified purchase and still wants to sell grain to buy a mule but was afraid to do so. After alleviating his concerns, he sold 500 jin at the first fair and said: "If I can buy a cart, I will sell another 500 jin of wheat." Liu Cailan, a woman from Zhangwugang, used to ask cadres to buy grain every day, but now she has sold 200 jin of wheat. Through propaganda, education, and the establishment of a new type of grain market, the masses have further realized the Party and government's grain policy.

Finally, appropriate measures must be determined and agreed upon by the masses. Our measures are: (1) Under the leadership of the district grain work committee, the supply and marketing cooperative in the market town takes the lead, absorbing neighboring townships to form a market management committee responsible for mobilizing mass supervision and management. (2) To prevent speculation and profiteering, private merchants are not allowed to participate in transactions. (3) To prevent chaotic transactions and hoarding, towns, government institutions, and organizations implementing planned supply are not allowed to enter the market for transactions. Grain-deficient households must buy grain with grain purchase certificates, fill in the amount of grain purchased, and explain to the masses that this is mainly to prevent grain merchants from speculating. Those with special circumstances are allowed to purchase a little more. Those who need to purchase or adjust grain without a grain purchase certificate must have a certificate from the township, but it is only valid for buying grain in the market and not valid at state-owned grain stores (market transaction certificates are currently being trialed). (4) Exchange fine grains for coarse grains. If there is not enough coarse grain in the market, the state can, with the consent of the masses, first collect their fine grain, issue a certificate, and give them priority when the next batch arrives. However, for grain-deficient households or those who genuinely need adjustment but repeatedly fail to obtain it, the grain store will provide necessary support based on its capacity. (5) Regarding the price and handling fee, adopt a principle that benefits both the seller and the buyer. Stipulate that the selling price for farmers is slightly higher than the state purchase price by about 1.5%, charge a handling fee of 2% to 2.5%, and the purchase price is lower than the state unified sales price. (6) Currently, no taxes are levied on those who buy more grain temporarily (supply and marketing cooperatives still pay income tax), and quantity limits are only imposed on grain purchasing households without grain purchase certificates, limited to 60 jin each time (the masses currently buy mostly 20 to 30 jin). (7) Flour mills, tofu workshops, and oil presses after the unified purchase are allowed to buy raw materials in the market according to the actual production volume (issue a certificate). The other grains exchanged for raw materials are allowed to be sold to the state, and the grain department provides raw materials as needed. These measures have been implemented from lenient to strict and have been effective.

    崔桥区建立国家新型粮食市场的经验
    中共许昌地方委员会
    从河南扶沟县崔桥区的两个集市（崔桥、李桥）试办国家新型粮食市场的结果证明，建立国家粮食市场对活跃农村经济和促进农民互通有无方面的作用很大。这首先表现在市场内交易频繁，粮食上市量日趋增多。如李桥市场第一集上市粮食六百九十一斤，除群众相互进行调剂外，国家收购粮食四百六十三斤。第二集粮食上市量较第一集上升百分之一百零五，国家收购量增加了百分之一百一十五。崔桥市场第一集上市粮食一千一百二十七斤，以后每集上市量都增加到二千斤左右。随着粮食上市量增加，国家在当地粮食供应量也大大减少。该区四月上旬日销量为一万二千斤，中旬降为八千五百斤。由于粮食市场活跃，棉花上市量也骤然增加。全区四月上旬收购三千余斤，中旬收购五千余斤，增加了百分之七十。从而进一步活跃了农村经济。
    农民对这样的粮食市场是欢迎的。他们看到国家新型的粮食市场与旧的自由市场的不同，就积极协助做好市场的管理工作。如李桥市场第一集农民就检举了一私商抢购囤积粮食，崔桥农民也检举了
  一个地主套购粮食的违法行为。农民说：“在国家粮食市场进行交易、调剂，价格合理，换购、买卖都方便，谁肯将粮食再卖给私商。”
    崔桥区建立国家粮食市场的经验告诉我们，要在农村建立国家新型的粮食市场，首先要教育区乡干部全面了解国家的粮食政策，认识建立国家新型粮食市场的必要性。开始时崔桥区有些区乡干部对建立市场没信心，存在怕麻烦、怕“烧香引了鬼来家”等顾虑，抵触情绪很大。针对这种顾虑，全面说明国家的粮食政策，说明建立国家粮食市场对活跃经济、调剂有无、补助国家供应等的重要性，又结合当地情况进行分析，对干部的教育很大。如该区由于粮食市场停滞，一部分有余粮的农民在拂晓时，偷偷卖粮或夜间黑市成交（东谷村一夜成交四百余斤），很多农民因为得不到正当的自由调剂，缺乏口粮；有的农民因粮种不能调剂，只得将麦子磨两遍后当饲料，或拿绿豆喂牲口。因此就助长了商贩黑市活动，买卖青苗的现象也随着发生。（魏肖海一户买青苗一千五百斤，每斤一千元）。根据这些事实向干部进行教育后，干部对建立国家粮食市场的必要性和重要性开始有了认识，信心也增强了。
    其次，要依靠党团员，组织村干部、积极分子，向互助组与单干农民展开广泛深入的宣传教育与组织工作。着重说明：（一）国家对缺粮户保证不漏掉一户一人的供应政策。（二）粮食统购后，允许农民出卖余粮和调剂有无的政策。粮食统购时应多卖而少卖、不卖的人，现在到市场出售，是有了觉悟，应该欢迎，不得歧视和打击。（三）建立新型市场的目的、性质、办法与群众互相调剂有无的好处。经过宣传，打破顾虑（如：怕把粮食拿到市上当余粮户丢人、怕说违法、不老实，到市场卖不如直接到国家粮食店去又光荣又不误生产等）。造成了劳动增产、卖余粮、调剂粮食是光荣的空气。因此群众纷纷出卖余粮。如院庄村谷子春，统购时卖粮二千斤，现在仍想卖粮买骡子，但不敢卖，解除顾虑后，第一集卖出五百斤，并说：
  “如能买到大车，我还要卖小麦五百斤。”张坞岗的妇女刘采兰，过去天天找干部要买粮，现在又卖出小麦二百斤。通过宣传教育与新型粮食市场的建立，使群众进一步体会到党和政府的粮食政策。
    最后，要确定恰当的措施，并征求群众同意。我们的措施是：（一）在区粮食工作委员会的领导下，以集市所在地的供销合作社为主，吸收邻乡成立市场管理委员会，负责发动群众性的监督管理。（二）为了防止投机倒把，不许私商参加交易。（三）为了防止交易混乱与贩运囤积，凡实行计划供应的城镇与机关团体等，不得进市交易，缺粮户须持购粮证买粮，并填写购粮数量，向群众说明这样做主要是为防止粮商投机。有特殊情况者，允许农民多购一点。无购粮证需要购粮与调剂者，要有乡的证明，但只在市场买粮有效，到国营粮食店无效
  （现正试制市场交易证）。（四）以细粮换粗粮。如市场粗粮不够，可征得群众同意，先由国家将其细粮收下，开具证明，下次上市后有优先权，但对缺粮户，或确实需要调剂而又一再换不到的，粮食店视实力给以必要支持。（五）价格与手续费的问题，采取卖粮与买粮人都有利的原则，规定农民出售价格稍高于收购牌价百分之一点五左右，收手续费百分之二到二点五，购粮价格低于统销牌价。（六）目前对多买粮者暂不收税（供销合作社仍交所得税），只对无购粮证的买粮户，实行限量，每次以六十斤为限（群众目前多是二十斤至三十斤）。（七）准许粉坊、豆腐坊及统购后的油坊，在市场上按生产实数买原料（发证明），其用成品换原料时，所换来的其他粮食，准许卖给国家，粮食部门，视需要给予原料。以上措施执行时，均由宽到严，效果良好。
