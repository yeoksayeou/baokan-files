    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 31st: The Geneva Conference discussing the restoration of peace in Indochina held a restricted session on May 31st. The following communique was released after the meeting:
    "The delegations of the nine countries continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina in a restricted meeting. The meeting was informed that military representatives of both sides would hold a preliminary meeting on June 1st to arrange a meeting of representatives from both sides' commands. The next restricted meeting will be held on June 2nd."
    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 31st: This agency's special correspondent reports: The restricted conference on Indochina held its ninth meeting on the afternoon of May 31st. As the conference has decided that military representatives of both sides will hold a preliminary meeting in Geneva on June 1st, the work of delineating the regroupment areas for the armed forces of both sides in Indochina is about to begin.
    According to information already obtained, the restricted meeting on the 31st focused on the fourth point of the six-point proposal made by the Chinese delegation on May 27th, namely, the implementation of the armistice agreement and international supervision. An important development in the meeting was the constructive proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation for the resolution of this issue, namely: that a neutral nations supervisory committee composed of representatives from India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan be responsible for international supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement.
    The meeting on the 31st was based on the six-point proposal made by the Chinese delegation on May 27th for discussion. As previously reported, the Chinese delegation's proposal summarized the common points in the opinions expressed by all parties at the meeting regarding the military armistice, with the aim of affirming them in order to further negotiate and resolve the remaining differences. The first and second points of the Chinese delegation's six-point proposal have already been embodied in the resolution unanimously adopted at the previous restricted meeting (May 29th). The current issue is to affirm the other points one by one. It is understood that the statements made by the delegations of various countries at the meeting on the 31st focused on the issue of international supervision of the implementation of the armistice agreement. Naturally, other issues should also be discussed.
    As previously reported, the principle of implementing international supervision has been agreed to by the delegations of the participating countries. The question lies in determining what kind of organization will carry out the task of international supervision, how this organization will be composed, and what its scope of authority will be.
    In its supplementary proposal to the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation on May 10th, put forward on May 14th, the Soviet delegation advocated that neutral countries supervise the armistice in order to ensure the impartiality and effectiveness of the supervision. This reasonable proposal was agreed to by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delegation and supported by the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation pointed out that in order to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement, it is absolutely necessary to establish two types of supervisory organizations: one is a mixed commission composed of representatives of the belligerent parties, and the other is a neutral nations supervisory committee composed of representatives of neutral countries. The former is the supervisory organization of the belligerent parties, and the latter is the international supervisory organization.
    News released after the meeting indicates that at the meeting on the 31st, no one opposed the establishment of a neutral nations supervisory committee, but the delegations of some Western countries deliberately tried to obliterate the necessity for the simultaneous existence of the above-mentioned two organizations, either actually canceling the neutral nations supervisory committee or actually canceling the mixed commission of the belligerent parties. The US delegation made particular efforts to make the neutral nations supervisory committee lose its neutrality.
    The future development of the meeting's discussion on the issue of neutral countries supervising the armistice will depend on whether the delegations of Western countries agree to the principles of fair and effective supervision.

### 日内瓦限制性会议继续讨论印度支那问题  印度支那双方军事代表定于一日举行会议

    日内瓦限制性会议继续讨论印度支那问题
    印度支那双方军事代表定于一日举行会议
    【新华社日内瓦三十一日电】五月三十一日讨论关于恢复印度支那和平问题的日内瓦会议举行了限制性的会议。会后发表公报如下：
    “九国代表团在限制性会议中继续讨论恢复印度支那和平问题。会议获悉，双方军事代表将于六月一日举行初步会议，以安排双方司令部代表的会议。下次限制性的会议将于六月二日举行。”
    据新华社日内瓦五月三十一日电：本社特派记者报道：关于印度支那问题的限制性会议三十一日下午举行了第九次会议。由于会议确定双方军事代表将于六月一日在日内瓦举行初步会议，划定印度支那双方军队的重新集结地区的工作就要开始了。
    据已获得的消息说，三十一日的限制性会议着重讨论了中国代表团五月二十七日的六点建议中的第四点，即关于停战协定的履行和国际监督问题。会议的重要发展是苏联代表团对这个问题的解决提出了建设性的建议，即：由印度、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及巴基斯坦四个中立国的代表组成中立国监督委员会，负责对停战协定的履行进行国际监督。
    三十一日的会议是以中国代表团五月二十七日的六点建议为基础进行讨论的。如以前所报道的，中国代表团的建议归纳了各方面在会议上所发表的关于军事停战部分的意见中的共同点，目的是把它们肯定下来，以进一步协商解决尚存的分歧意见。中国代表团的六点建议中，第一和第二两点原则已体现在前一次（五月二十九日）限制性会议上一致通过的决议中。现在的问题是逐一肯定其他各点。据悉：三十一日的会议上各国代表团的发言都集中在对停战协定实施的国际监督问题上。自然，其他问题亦应加以讨论。
    如过去所报道的，实行国际监督这一原则是与会各国代表团所同意的。问题在于确定由一个怎么样的机构来执行国际监督的任务，这个机构如何组成，它的职权范围如何。
    苏联代表团在五月十四日所提出的对越南民主共和国代表团五月十日建议的补充建议中，曾主张由中立国监督停战，以保证监督的公正和有效。这个合理的主张曾经得到越南民主共和国代表团的同意和中国代表团的支持。中国代表团曾经指出：为了监督停战协定的实施，设立两种监督组织是完全必要的，一种是交战双方代表组成的混合委员会，一种是由中立国代表组成的中立国监督委员会。前者是交战双方的监督组织，后者是国际监督组织。
    会后传出的消息表明，在三十一日会议上，没有人反对成立中立国监督委员会，但是，某些西方国家的代表团有意抹煞上述两种组织同时存在的必要，他们不是实际上取消中立国监督委员会，就是实际上取消交战双方的混合委员会。美国代表团特别努力于使中立国监督委员会失去它的中立性。
    会议关于中立国监督停战问题的讨论的今后发展，将决定于西方国家的代表团是否同意公正和有效的监督的原则。
