    Northeast Coal Mines Hold Safety Production Meeting to Criticize Complacency, Exchange Safety Production Experiences
    The Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department and the Northeast Committee of the China Coal Mine Trade Union recently jointly convened the Northeast Coal Mine Safety Production Meeting.
    Northeast coal mines have made considerable achievements in safety production in recent years. Some pits have implemented the policy of safe production, promoted new mining methods, strengthened roof and ventilation management, and eliminated fatal accidents. However, because many units are satisfied with the achievements they have made, and some units have not well accepted instructions from higher authorities, expert suggestions, advanced experiences from brother mining areas, and technological reforms, technical management has almost remained at the level of 1951 for several years. This is reflected in the continued severity of fatalities caused by accidents.
    Li Jianping, Director of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau, examined the reasons for the serious accident situation, mainly the pride and complacency of leading cadres, and the incompatibility of technical management level with the development of production. Song Zhichun, Deputy Director of the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Department, severely criticized the pride and complacency of leaders at all levels, as well as the phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline including leaders at all levels in his concluding remarks, and pointed out specific ways to improve safety production in the future.
    In order to do a good job in safe production, the meeting made five resolutions: First, it is necessary to correct the ideological understanding of leading cadres, firmly establish the idea of "production must be safe, and safety is for production" among all employees; overcome the lack of long-term planning and non-overall concept thinking; establish the idea of ​​trusting science and relying on technology; and overcome pride, complacency, and conservative thinking, and learn from advanced experience with an open mind.
    Second, continue to strengthen planning management, taking the promotion of the regional responsibility system and strengthening technical management as the center, vigorously implement the operating procedures for mining and excavation sites, promote regular cycle chart operations, and strengthen production geology and tunneling work, mastering the balanced development of the three links of production geology, tunneling and coal mining.
    Third, implement the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to launch a technical innovation campaign nationwide. The meeting called on all coal mine workers in Northeast China to deeply carry out labor emulation centered on safety production and with technical innovation as the content.
    Fourth, strengthen labor discipline education and oppose tendencies towards disorganization and indiscipline. Leading cadres must oppose bad practices such as "failure to implement instructions and resolutions from higher authorities, emphasizing objective difficulties, and perfunctorily handling matters." Among grassroots cadres and workers, oppose failure to implement rules and regulations and the destruction of labor discipline.
    Fifth, strengthen several measures for safety production work: 1. The business security system must be vigorously promoted. 2. Establish and improve mass safety supervisors and safety supervision networks to give full play to their role. 3. Strengthen the organizational leadership of safety activity days to give full play to the role of employees in supervision, inspection, and self-education. 4. Safety inspection agencies of various bureaus and mines must be established and improved; technical inspectors must have duties and powers. 5. Strengthen labor protection work, and labor protection committees in pits and workshops must be established and improved.

    批判自满情绪交流安全生产经验
    东北煤矿举行安全生产会议
    中央燃料工业部东北煤矿管理局和中国煤矿工会东北委员会最近联合召开了东北煤矿安全生产会议。
    东北煤矿几年来在安全生产方面是有不少成绩的。有些坑口贯彻了安全生产方针，推行了新式采煤方法，加强了顶板、通风管理，消灭了死亡事故。但是由于不少单位满足于既得成绩，有些单位对于上级指示、专家建议、兄弟矿区的先进经验及技术改革等，没有很好地接受，因而几年来技术管理几乎还停留在一九五一年的水平。表现在因事故而死亡的现象仍很严重。
    东北煤矿管理局局长李建平检查了事故情况严重的原因，主要是领导干部有骄傲自满情绪，和技术管理水平与生产发展的不相适应。中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局副局长宋之春在会议总结中对各级领导骄傲自满情绪以及包括各级领导在内的无组织无纪律现象给予严厉的批评，并且指出了今后做好安全生产的具体办法。
    为了做好安全生产，会议作出五项决议：第一、必须端正领导干部思想认识，在全体职工中牢固地树立“生产必须安全，安全为了生产”的思想；克服缺乏长远打算的与非整体观念的思想；树立相信科学，依靠技术科学的思想；克服骄傲自满情绪和保守思想，虚心学习先进经验。
    第二、继续加强计划管理，以推广区域负责制和加强技术管理为中心，大力贯彻采掘场子作业规程，推行正规循环图表作业，并加强生产地质与掘进工作，掌握生产地质，掘进采煤三个环节的平衡发展。
    第三、贯彻全国总工会关于在全国范围内开展技术革新运动的决定，会议号召在东北全体煤矿职工中，深入开展以安全生产为中心，以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛。
    第四、加强劳动纪律教育，反对无组织、无纪律的倾向。在领导干部中必须反对“对上级指示决议不执行，强调客观困难，敷衍了事”等不良作风。在基层干部和工人中，反对不执行规程制度，破坏劳动纪律现象。
    第五、加强安全生产工作的几个措施：一、必须大力推行业务保安制。二、建立与健全群众性安全监察员和安全监察网，使其充分发挥作用。三、加强安全活动日的组织领导，使其充分发挥职工群众监督检查与自我教育的作用。四、各局矿安全检查机构要健全起来；技术检查员要有职有权。五、加强劳动保护工作，坑口、车间劳动保护委员会必须建立与健全起来。
