    [This newspaper reports] On the basic construction sites in Beijing, fifty-nine youth shock brigades have emerged in fourteen basic construction units. When the first carpentry youth shock brigade was established in the Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area in January of this year, it had only eighteen people. Now, the number of youth shock brigade members has grown to nine hundred and seventy-nine, distributed across various major trades, playing an active role in completing the national plan. On the construction site of the single dormitory and cafeteria of the North China Directly Subordinate First Construction Engineering Company, the plastering youth shock brigade continuously exceeded the state quota in thirteen plastering projects of various sizes, completing over 10,000 square meters of plastering work, ensuring the on-schedule completion of the main structure of the entire construction area. On the construction site of the Military Commission Directly Subordinate Engineering Company, Xiao Yaoqin, a bricklayer in the youth shock brigade, and an assistant laid 12,000 bricks in one day. The weight of these bricks alone was more than 33,000 kilograms. In their team, the quota for laying foundation trenches was originally 2,000 bricks, but on the first day, they reached 2,887 bricks, the second day 3,300 bricks, and finally reached 5,134 bricks. Everyone said that the youth shock brigade is a "locomotive," driving many workers to improve labor productivity. The Jie Qijue strong labor group was originally a relatively backward group on a construction site of the Beijing First Construction Engineering Company. Influenced by the excellent achievements of the youth shock brigade and through their own efforts, they have now become a very good group on the construction site. From March 19th to April 29th, the carpentry, bricklaying, and rebar youth shock brigades of the Beijing Hotel construction area continuously completed the fourteen tasks they were assigned ahead of schedule and exceeding quotas, reducing project costs. The rebar youth shock brigade of the Beijing Second Construction Engineering Company used three advanced tools: "large iron cutting machine," "manual rebar bending machine," and "electric rebar straightening machine." The sheet metal youth shock brigade of the Soviet Exhibition Hall construction area adopted a "seaming tool" created by two young people when laying iron sheets on the roof, increasing efficiency by seven times. The rebar youth shock brigade of the Beijing Second Construction Engineering Company put forward the slogan "Finish the day's work on the same day, calculate on the same day." Every evening, they studied the advantages and disadvantages of the day's work, calculated the amount of work, and arranged the work for the next day.

    北京市基本建设工地上
    青年突击队努力提高劳动生产率
    【本报讯】北京市十四个基本建设单位的许多工地上，出现了五十九个青年突击队。今年一月，苏联展览馆工区成立第一个木工青年突击队时，只有十八个人，现在青年突击队员已发展到九百七十九人，他们分布在各主要工种中，在完成国家计划中发挥了积极作用。华北直属第一建筑工程公司单人宿舍、食堂工地上，抹灰工青年突击队在大小十三项抹灰工程中，不断地超过国家定额，完成了一万多平方公尺的抹灰任务，保证了整个工区主体工程按期完成。军委直属工程公司工地上，突击队员瓦工青年萧耀勤和一个助手一天砌了一万两千块砖，单说这些砖的重量，就有三万三千多公斤。在他们队里，砌地槽的定额原是两千块，但是第一天，他们就达到两千八百八十七块，第二天三千三百块，最后达到了五千一百三十四块。大家都说青年突击队是“火车头”，他们带动了许多工人提高了劳动生产率。解倛觉壮工小组原来是北京市第一建筑工程公司某工地比较落后的小组，受到青年突击队优良成绩的影响，并经过了他们自己的努力，现在成为工地上一个很好的小组。北京饭店工区的木工、瓦工、钢筋工三个青年突击队，从三月十九日到四月二十九日，在所接受的十四项任务中，不断地提前超额完成任务，降低了工程成本。北京市第二建筑工程公司钢筋工青年突击队运用了“大型断铁机”、“人力钢筋弯曲机”、“电力抽筋机”三种先进工具。苏联展览馆工区白铁工青年突击队在铺房顶铁皮时，采用了两个青年新创造的“压口器”工具，提高效率七倍。北京市第二建筑工程公司钢筋工青年突击队提出“当天活当天完，当天算”的口号。他们每天晚上都要研究当天工作的优点和缺点，计算工作数量，安排第二天的工作。
