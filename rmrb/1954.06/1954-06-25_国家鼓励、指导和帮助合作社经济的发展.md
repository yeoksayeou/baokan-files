The Existing Achievements are Protected

    Bian Yongsheng, Chairman of the Dongzhuangzi Cooperative Farm in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, couldn't bear to put down the newspaper containing the draft constitution after reading it several times. He was delighted that all 127 households in their village had already been organized to establish a cooperative farm, and they had received help from the worker brothers in production, using electric irrigation and tractors for plowing. As a result, the land that originally yielded 200 to 300 jin of grain per mu has increased to 700 jin; the lives of the farmers have become prosperous. All the farmers received education on the general task of the transition period last year. Due to the improvement of their ideological awareness, people's production enthusiasm has become even higher. Just at this time, the draft constitution was published, affirming the achievements that the people have already obtained. He said that he will better lead and motivate all the farmers to actively respond to the call of the state and produce more grain to support industrial construction in the future. Now we need to do the following things well: First, vigorously accumulate fertilizer. In addition to immediately planting eight mu of Amorpha fruticosa, we will also call on the farmers to dig more fertilizer pits. Secondly, we must dig 136 ditches to store sweet water before the salt water comes, so that the rice will not be harmed and a bumper harvest can be achieved, and various pests must be controlled and treated at any time. By doing these things well, we can increase the yield of the village's 2,003 mu of rice fields from 700 jin per mu last year to 740 jin, increasing grain production by more than 80,000 jin for the country.

Our Heartfelt Words are All Written Down

    Wang Chaoyou, a Shandong Provincial Agricultural Labor Model, kept thinking about the articles written in the draft constitution after reading it. He remembered two of them very clearly. One is "All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at all levels." This is something he has personally experienced. He himself is now a representative of the county people's congress and participated in the first people's congress of Licheng County, discussing major issues of the county and becoming the master of the country. The other is "The State guides and helps individual peasants to increase production and encourages them to organize production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation based on the principle of voluntariness." He said: "I especially like this one because I have tasted the sweetness of taking the road of mutual assistance and cooperation." Their cooperative now has two new-style walking plows, three sprayers, five waterwheels, one large rubber-tired cart, three mules, six donkeys, and fifteen oxen. They have also dug 17 new wells, expanding the irrigated area; and they have also renovated 70 mu of land. Because they are organized, production has been continuously improved, and life has gradually gotten better. Out of the 58 households in the cooperative, 37 households did not have enough income to eat and use throughout the year before joining the cooperative. Now, except for 7 households that can only be self-sufficient, the remaining 30 households have surplus grain. There are now more than 20 children in the cooperative attending elementary school; adults also attend literacy classes. Wang Chaoyou, who was illiterate in the past, can now recognize eight or nine hundred characters and can keep accounts and records. Wang Chaoyou said, "If it weren't for the state led by the working class, it wouldn't be like this." He also said, "Now the leadership of the worker brothers, the people being the masters of the country, and helping farmers take the road of collectivization are all written in the draft constitution. These are all our heartfelt words, so of course we warmly welcome this draft constitution."

The Bright Road for Peasants

    Yang Hongyi, director of the Victory Vegetable Production Cooperative in Dazhaizai Town, Suburbs of Dalian City, is a member of the Dalian City Constitution Draft Discussion Committee. After seeing the draft constitution, he felt particularly close to three of the articles. The draft constitution stipulates that the state encourages, guides, and helps the development of cooperative economy, and takes the development of production cooperation as the main road for transforming individual agriculture and individual handicrafts. He said: Experience has proved that this road is the bright road for working farmers. I and another twenty-five households formed a mutual aid team in 1951 and produced 7,000 jin of vegetables per mu. In 1952, we formed an agricultural production cooperative and produced 9,600 jin of vegetables per mu. Last year, the cooperative expanded. Although the natural conditions were not good, it still increased production compared to 1952. He said: If we didn't have the help of the People's Government and the working class, let alone the agricultural production cooperative, even the mutual aid team wouldn't be able to run well! Our cooperative now has fourteen electric wells, and only fourteen people are needed to watch the waterways, and the work is easy. Vegetable gardens far from the wells can also be watered. There are two thousand glass windows to protect the seedlings, and a large number of vegetables can be produced as usual in winter. However, if there are no pesticides and sprayers, what can be done if 228 mu of vegetable gardens are infested with pests and diseases? Speaking of this, I think of the great significance of Article 1 of the draft constitution, which stipulates that "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." With such a country, we can be guaranteed to transition to a socialist society step by step. The draft constitution also stipulates: "The State guides the development and transformation of the national economy by means of economic plans, so as to continuously improve the productive forces, improve the material and cultural life of the people, and consolidate the independence and security of the State." He also felt that this article was very important from his personal experience. He said that in the past, our production was not in accordance with the national plan, and as a result, too many vegetables were produced during the peak season, and the city could not use them; too few vegetables were produced during the off-season, and the people in the city lacked vegetables. However, since the second half of last year, we have signed "triangular contracts" with supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives to carry out planned production according to the needs of the city, and supplied 730,000 jin of vegetables to the city on time. In April this year, although our cooperative produced more than 10,000 jin of vegetables every day, not only could they be sold, but the price of vegetables was also more reasonable than in the past. I want to study and discuss the draft constitution with the members of the cooperative, and respond to all the calls of the Party and the State, work hard to produce, and support national construction.

The Two Articles Remembered Most Clearly

    Pu Zhongzhi, director of the "July 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, said after listening to the cadres read the draft constitution that the draft constitution wrote down many things that the people of the whole country have done under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao; and it also wrote down what should be done in the future. What I remember most clearly are Articles 7 and 8. Article 8 states that the state guides and helps individual farmers to increase production and encourages farmers to organize production cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation based on the principle of voluntariness. These provisions have already been implemented in our Wangmang Village. Facts have proved that this is completely correct. Among the 166 households in Wangmang Village, about 75 percent of the households did not have enough to eat in 1948 (the year before liberation). Now, because more than 80 percent of the farmers in our village have joined the agricultural production cooperative, and more than 90 percent of the farmers have joined the supply and marketing cooperative and credit cooperative organizations, not only do they all have enough to eat and use, but more than half of the farmers also have surplus grain. Last year, our village sold more than 110,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Article 7 of the draft constitution also points out the road for further development for us. The four agricultural production cooperatives in our village plan to merge into one large cooperative after the autumn harvest, and will also develop into a higher form of agricultural production cooperative in the future according to the road pointed out in Article 7 of the draft constitution.

If It Weren't for Cooperativization, How Could It Be So Good?

    The members of the Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, after studying the draft constitution together one night, many people said what was in their hearts with emotion. Cooperative director Xu Zhangcheng said: "In the past, there was no place for us working people in the laws of the reactionaries. They treated us farmers like cattle and horses. Now, the draft constitution made under the leadership of Chairman Mao has our working people's 'place' in all 106 articles. The first article says that the worker brothers lead, and the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation..." Everyone felt most deeply about the point stipulated in the draft constitution that the state should encourage, guide, and help the development of cooperative economy. The members said: Which of the water pump in front of the village and the threshing machine in the cooperative was not assisted by the state. Last year, the entire cooperative increased production by 33 percent. The more than 90 mu of rice seedlings in the cooperative that were replanted this year are growing the best in the whole township. The ears of rice have already drooped, and they will be harvested in more than ten days. Every day, dozens of people from agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams from nearby townships come to visit. If we don't take the road of cooperativization, how could it be so good? He Yingdi, the production team leader and female member, said: "The draft constitution stipulates that men and women are equal, and it's not false at all. Land is divided into seven shares for men and seven shares for women. Now, labor scoring is the same for women and men." Vice-director Zeng Shuilian patted the child in her arms and said: "The draft constitution expresses our wishes. Socialism is not waited for, it depends on everyone's efforts. We are confident of a bumper harvest of early rice, and we will also strive for a bumper harvest of late rice and strive for bumper harvests every year. This year, we will guarantee to pay good public grain and sell 10,000 jin more rice to the state than last year." Lin Zenglin, an old cooperative director from a neighboring village who participated in the study with them, said with a smile: "In the past, some people laughed at me: 'You're already old, what are you looking forward to socialism for!' Now the draft constitution stipulates that socialism should be realized. As long as everyone works hard, everyone can live a happy socialist life."

    The evening breeze brought the fragrance of rice, and the smiling people were reluctant to leave for a long time.

A Picture of a Happy Life

    Lu Hongbin, an agricultural labor model and director of the Lu Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shandong Province, felt that with the guarantee of the constitution after seeing the draft constitution, the days of being exploited and oppressed in the past would never come again, and a picture of a happy life appeared before his eyes. He said: Our agricultural production cooperative has been established for nearly three years, and it has now expanded from the initial five households to 116 households. Land yields have increased year by year. In 1952, the average yield per mu was only 347 jin, and last year the average yield per mu was already 404 jin; while the land yield per mu before liberation was only 149 jin. This is because, at that time, "people were poor and the land was bad, and only shepherd's purse grew"; but now, with the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of the People's Government, coupled with the active labor of all members, the yield has increased year by year. The increase in land yields has greatly improved our lives. In the past, most of the members of our cooperative had half a year of grain and vegetables, and clothes were not divided into winter and summer, but last year, 59 members had 21 households with surplus grain. When I went to Beijing in 1950 to attend the representative meeting of labor models of workers, peasants and soldiers, I saw the girls there dressed very beautifully, and I thought: When will the girls in our rural areas be like this? Now my hope has become a reality. Most of the girls in our cooperative are wearing brightly colored calico and colored cloth clothes. With the improvement of life, children also have the opportunity to receive education. In the past, there was only one student in the whole village, and now there are more than 50 in the cooperative alone. Lu Jun's family had no schooling for three generations, and now there are three children in the family who are attending school. From the above facts, I deeply feel that agricultural collectivization is the road to prosperity for everyone. Now our cooperative has implemented a fixed land dividend system and is piloting contract work and production in four production teams, laying the foundation for further implementing a higher level of agricultural production cooperative. Therefore, I feel that Article 7 of the draft constitution, which stipulates that "the State protects the property of cooperatives, encourages, guides and helps the development of cooperative economy, and takes the development of production cooperation as the main road for transforming individual agriculture and individual handicrafts" is very correct.

Two Societies, Two Kinds of Life

    Rao Xingli, director of the Rao Xingli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, Hubei Province, deeply felt the superiority of our country's social system after seeing the draft constitution. He said that before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries had formulated a pseudo-"constitution," which was for the benefit of a small number of ruling classes and was specially designed to oppress and exploit us working people. We working people did not recognize it at all. Take Wan Dongan, a member of our agricultural production cooperative, for example. In the past, he cultivated 28 shi of land for the landlord and had to pay 24 shi of rent a year. He couldn't even take care of his life. How could he have the heart to produce? The land became thinner and thinner, and if he couldn't get grain to pay the rent, the landlord would forcibly take away his farming cattle and farm tools, and if he didn't give them, he would be said to be breaking the law. After liberation, we peasants were allocated land and became masters of our own affairs, and we were no longer oppressed and exploited. Wan Dongan was allocated 28 shi of land, and farming cattle and farm tools were also allocated. In 1952, under the support and leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we established an agricultural production cooperative. In the past two years, the government has given us loans to help us improve our farming techniques, so that our production has been continuously improved. This year, the worker brothers in Wuhan City sent us a water pump, which saved us a lot of labor and allowed us to use it for intensive farming and develop agricultural production. ... We understand that it is because of the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the support of industry, that we have increased production, produced more grain, and continuously consolidated and expanded the cooperative, and are moving towards a happy life day by day. And these have been clearly embodied and fixed in the draft constitution, how can we not be delighted and wholeheartedly support it!

### 国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展

专栏：

    国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展
    已有的成果得到保护
    河北省宁河县董庄子合作农庄主席边永生，接到登载着宪法草案的报纸以后，看了好几遍都舍不得放下。他高兴的是他们全村一百二十七户农民，现在都已经组织起来建立了合作农庄，在生产上又得到了工人老大哥的帮助，使用电力灌溉和拖拉机耕地，因此，原来每亩产二百斤至三百斤粮食的地，已经增到七百斤；庄员的生活富裕起来了。全体庄员在去年都受到了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，由于思想觉悟的提高，人们的生产情绪更高涨起来了。正在这个时候，宪法草案公布了，它把人民已经得到的这些成果肯定下来了。他说，我今后要更好地领导和带动全体庄员积极响应国家的号召，多打粮食来支援工业建设。现在我们要作好以下几件事：首先是大力积肥。除马上栽培八亩紫穗槐外，并号召庄员多挖积肥坑。其次，要挖渠沟一百三十六道，做到咸水来前储满甜水，使稻子不受危害，达到丰收，并要随时除治各种虫害。做好这些，就能使庄里二千零三亩稻田由去年每亩产七百斤增到七百四十斤，为国家增产八万余斤稻谷。
    咱们心里的话都写上了
    山东省农业劳动模范王朝佑，看了宪法草案以后，老是想着宪法草案里写的那些条条。其中有两条，他记得很清楚。一条是“中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。”这是他亲身体验到的，他自己现在就是县人民代表大会的代表，参加了历城县第一次人民代表大会，讨论了全县大事，做了国家的主人。另外一条是“国家指导和帮助个体农民增加生产，并且鼓励他们根据自愿的原则组织生产合作、供销合作和信用合作。”他说：“我看了这条特别喜欢，因为我尝过走互助合作道路的甜头了。”他们社现在已有新式步犁两部、喷雾器三架、水车五部、大胶皮车一辆、骡子三头、驴六头、牛十五头。他们还打新井十七眼，扩大了灌溉面积；又整修了七十亩土地。他们因为组织起来，生产不断提高，生活也逐渐好起来了。全社五十八户，在未入社前有三十七户全年收入不够吃用，现在除七户只能自给自足外，其余三十户都有余粮。社里现在有二十多个小孩上小学；大人也上了识字班，过去一字不识的王朝佑，现在也认到八、九百字，能记账、记事了。王朝佑说：“要不是工人阶级领导的国家，怎么也不会这样。”他又说：“现在宪法草案里把工人老大哥的领导、人民当家作主和帮助农民走合作化的道路都写上了，这都是咱心里的话，咱们当然热烈欢迎这个宪法草案。”
    农民的光明大道
    旅大市郊区大辛寨子镇胜利蔬菜生产合作社主任杨洪义，是旅大市宪法草案讨论委员会的委员。他看到宪法草案以后，对其中三条感到特别亲切。宪法草案里规定着国家鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并且以发展生产合作为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路。他说：经验证明，这条道路是劳动农民的光明大道。我和另外二十五户，一九五一年成立互助组，一亩地产了七千斤菜，一九五二年成立了农业生产合作社，一亩地产了九千六百斤菜。去年合作社扩大，虽然自然条件不好，但还是比一九五二年增产了。他说：假如没有人民政府和工人阶级帮助我们，别说生产合作社，就连互助组也办不好啊！我们合作社里现在已有十四眼电井，只用十四个人看水道就行了，干活还轻快，离井较远的菜园也能浇到。有两千扇玻璃窗子，保护菜秧，冬天照常能生产大批蔬菜。可是，若没有农药和喷雾器，二百二十八亩菜园生了害虫得了病，那还有法治吗？说到这里，我想到宪法草案第一条规定“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”的重大意义，有了这样的国家，就能保证我们一步步过渡到社会主义社会。宪法草案里还规定：“国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全。”这一条，他从切身体验，也感到很重要。他说，过去我们的生产不按国家计划，结果是旺季出的菜过多，城市用不了；淡季的菜过少，城市人民缺菜。可是从去年下半年起，我们跟供销合作社、消费合作社订了“三角合同”，根据城市需要进行有计划的生产，把七十三万斤菜按时供给了城市。今年四月，我们合作社虽然每天出产一万多斤菜，不但能卖出去，而且菜价还比过去合理了。我要和社员们好好学习和讨论宪法草案，并且要响应党和国家的一切号召，加劲生产，支援国家建设。
    记得最清楚的两条
    陕西省长安县王莽村“七一”农业生产合作社主任蒲忠智，听干部读了宪法草案以后说，宪法草案把全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下作过的许多事情，都写上了；把以后应该做的事情，也写上了。我记的最清楚的是第七条和第八条。第八条中说，国家指导和帮助个体农民增加生产，并鼓励农民根据自愿的原则组织生产合作、供销合作和信用合作。这些规定在我们王莽村都已经实现了。事实证明，这样作是完全正确的。王莽村一百六十六户人家中，在一九四八年（解放的前一年），有百分之七十五左右的户数不够吃，现在，因为我们村子有百分之八十以上的农民加入了农业生产合作社，百分之九十以上的农户加入了供销合作和信用合作的组织，不只都够吃够用，而且一半以上的农户还有了余粮。去年我们村子就卖给国家十一万多斤余粮。宪法草案第七条，还给我们指出了进一步发展的道路。我们村子的四个农业生产合作社，打算在秋收后合并成一个大社，还要按着宪法草案第七条中指出的道路，在将来发展成为高级形式的农业生产合作社。
    不是合作化，哪能这样好
    福州市郊区许章成农业生产合作社的社员们，一天晚上在一起学习宪法草案以后，许多人都感动的说出了自己心里的话。社长许章成说：“过去反动派的法律中那有我们劳动人民的地位，他们把我们农民当牛马使唤。现在毛主席领导订出的宪法草案，一百零六条条条都有我们劳动人民的‘地位’，头一条就说工人老大哥领导，工农联盟是基础……”。大伙儿对宪法草案上规定的国家要鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展这一点感受最深。社员们说：村前的抽水机、社里的打谷机那一样不是国家援助的。去年全社增产了三成三，今年社内改种连作的九十几亩稻苗，长得是全乡第一，稻穗已经垂头，再过十多天就要收割了。附近各乡每天都有几十个农业生产合作社和互助组的人来参观，如果不走合作化道路，哪能这样好？生产小组长、女社员何英俤说：“宪法草案规定男女平等，一点不假。分土地是男七分，女七分。现在劳动评分，女的和男的也一样。”副社长曾水莲拍着搂在怀中的幼儿说：“宪法草案说出了我们的心愿。社会主义不是等来的，要靠大家努力。我们早稻有把握丰收，还要争取晚稻丰收，争取年年丰收。今年我们保证缴好公粮，比去年多卖一万斤谷子给国家。”和他们一起参加学习的邻村的一个老社长林增霖笑着说：“过去有人笑我：‘你头发都白了还望什么社会主义！’现在宪法草案上规定要实现社会主义，只要大家努力，人人都能过社会主义的美满日子。”
    晚风吹来了稻子的清香，微笑着的人们久久舍不得散去。
    幸福生活的图景
    农业劳动模范、山东省吕鸿宾农业生产合作社社长吕鸿宾，看到宪法草案以后，感到有了宪法的保证，过去受剥削压迫的日子不会再来了，在他的眼前浮现了幸福生活的图景。他说：俺们的农业生产合作社成立将近三年了，现在已由起初的五户扩大到一百十六户。土地产量逐年增加。一九五二年每亩平均产量还才三百四十七斤，去年每亩平均产量已经是四百零四斤了；而解放前的土地产量每亩只是一百四十九斤。这是因为，那时“人穷地坏，光长荠荠菜”；而现在有共产党的领导和人民政府的扶持，加上全体社员劳动积极，产量便逐年增长。土地收获量的增加，使俺们的生活大大改善了。过去，俺社的大部分社员是糠菜半年粮，衣服不分冬夏，但是去年五十九户社员，就有二十一户有余粮。一九五○年我到北京开工农兵劳动模范代表会议时，看到那里的姑娘们打扮得很漂亮，心想：俺们农村的姑娘几时能这样呢？现在我的希望已经成了事实，俺社的姑娘们，多数都穿上了鲜艳的花布和色布衣服。随着生活的提高，孩子们也有了受教育的机会。过去全村只有一个学生，现在光社里就有五十多个。社员吕俊家三辈子都没有上学的，现在家里有三个孩子上了学。从以上事实中我深深感到农业集体化是大家富裕的道路。现在俺社已经实行了土地固定分红制，在四个生产队里试行了包工包产，为进一步实行更高级的农业生产合作社打下基础。因此，我感到宪法草案第七条中规定“国家保护合作社的财产，鼓励、指导和帮助合作社经济的发展，并且以发展生产合作为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路”是很对的。
    两个社会，两种生活
    湖北省浠水县饶兴礼农业生产合作社社长饶兴礼，看到宪法草案以后，深深体会到我国社会制度的优越性。他说，解放前，国民党反动派曾制定过伪“宪法”，那是为了少数统治阶级的利益，专门压迫和剥削我们劳动人民的。我们劳动人民根本不承认它。就拿我们农业生产合作社的社员万登安来说，过去种地主二十八石田，一年就要交二十四石租子，生活都顾不到，那里有心生产呢？地越种越瘦，打不到谷子交不起租，地主硬把耕牛农具抢走，如果不给，就说是犯法。解放以后，我们农民分得了土地，当家作了主人，再不受压迫和剥削了，万登安分到二十八石田，耕牛、农具也都分到了。一九五二年，我们在党和人民政府的支持和领导下，成立了农业生产合作社。两年来，政府给我们贷款，帮助我们改进耕作技术，使我们生产不断提高。今年，武汉市工人老大哥又送了一部抽水机给我们，使我们节省了很多劳动力，用来精耕细作，发展农业生产。……我们明白，是由于有了共产党和人民政府的领导，有了工业的支持，我们才增加了生产，多打了粮食，不断地巩固和扩大了合作社，一天一天地走向了幸福的生活。而这些，在宪法草案中都明确的体现和固定了下来，这怎能不叫我们欢欣鼓舞衷心拥护呢！
