    Downstream Yangtze River Area
    High-Voltage Power Grid Expansion Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The expanded high-voltage power grid in the downstream Yangtze River area, stretching over 280 kilometers, has been officially energized.

    This high-voltage power grid, centered on Nanjing, extending east to Wuxi in Jiangsu Province and west to Wuhu in Anhui Province, was gradually expanded starting in August 1952 and completed in late May of this year. Due to the development of industry and agriculture in this power grid area, the electricity consumption this year will increase by approximately 24 million kilowatt-hours compared to last year. After the power grid is officially energized, the entire region's power can be centrally dispatched, more fully supplying the electricity needs for industrial production and some agricultural production in the area. Places like Wuxi and Changzhou will be able to increase the electricity supply equivalent to the annual production of 40 million pounds of yarn. At the same time, after the power grid is energized, the cost per kilowatt-hour can be reduced.

    长江下游地区
    高压输电网扩建完成
    据新华社南京讯：长江下游扩建的长达二百八十多公里的高压输电网已正式通电。
    这个高压输电网以南京为中心，东到江苏省无锡，西到安徽省芜湖，是一九五二年八月开始陆续扩建，并在今年五月下旬扩建完成的。这个输电网地区由于工、农业的发展，今年用电量要比去年增加两千四百万度左右。输电网正式通电后，整个地区的电力就可以统一调度，更充分地供应这个地区工业生产和部分农业生产的用电需要。像无锡、常州等地，就可以增加相当于年产四千万磅纱所需的电力供应。同时，输电网通电后，并可使每度电的成本降低下来。
