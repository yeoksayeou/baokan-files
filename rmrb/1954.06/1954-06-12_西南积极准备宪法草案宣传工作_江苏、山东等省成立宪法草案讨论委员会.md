Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th: The Southwest region's provinces and cities are actively preparing for the discussion and propaganda work related to the draft constitution. Sichuan, Guizhou, Chongqing and other provinces and cities have formally established constitution draft discussion committees. Yunnan and Xikang provinces will also soon be established.

    The Sichuan Provincial Constitution Draft Discussion Committee was established on the 5th, and the first plenary meeting of the committee was held on the same day. The meeting determined that all levels of organs, people's organizations, faculty and staff of universities, colleges and middle schools, and members of democratic parties in Sichuan Province should generally read and discuss the initial draft of the constitution in order to initially understand the spirit and essence of the draft constitution. At the same time, it was decided that concentrated short-term training should be conducted for reporters and propagandists in various regions, so that after the formal publication of the draft constitution, large-scale publicity can be carried out to the people, and the masses can be led to conduct discussions. The meeting also determined that constitution draft discussion committees or sub-committees should be established in all special districts, cities, counties, universities, and colleges throughout the province.

    The Chongqing Constitution Draft Discussion Committee and the sub-committees of each district were established before June 4th. Units such as construction, railways, shipping, and transportation, as well as the Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, universities, literary and art circles, and the industrial and commercial sectors are also establishing sub-committees or offices. On June 5th, Cao Diqiu, Mayor of Chongqing Municipality, made a mobilization report on studying the draft constitution to cadres above the section chief level and reporters in the city. The city's work of training propagandists is actively underway. Each district and large-scale factory and mine has formulated a training plan. More than 13,000 propagandists are to be trained throughout the city. At present, each district and factory and mine have begun training, which is generally required to be completed by the 20th.

    After the official establishment of the Guizhou Provincial Constitution Draft Discussion Committee, 45 people were selected from the provincial-level organs to prepare as reporters, and 150 people were selected from Guiyang City to prepare for study, and then report to cadres and the masses separately.

    The Yiliang Special District of Yunnan Province has formally established a Constitution Draft Discussion Committee. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government began to arrange for cadres to study on the 8th.

    Xikang Province has selected more than ten prefectural committee and county-level cadres from provincial-level organs to report on the draft constitution in counties with convenient transportation, and to help the county train propagandists. From the 10th to the 20th, counties under the Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts of Xikang Province will hold a representative meeting of propagandists to study the propaganda work related to the draft constitution.

    [Our Newspaper] Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui and other provinces have recently established the People's Republic of China Constitution Draft Discussion Committee respectively, and discussed issues such as training reporters and propagandists of the draft constitution and how to carry out propaganda activities among the people. The Jiangsu Provincial Constitution Draft Discussion Committee has begun training reporters and propagandists from the province, cities, and counties since the 5th.
