Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    The Henan Provincial Department of Finance reports in a letter on their investigation of the problem of the Shangqiu Special Commissioner's Office's backlogged brick and tile machines:

    In September 1951, the Shangqiu Special Commissioner's Office ordered two brick presses with a daily output of 40,000 bricks each, one tile making machine, and one mud grinding machine from Qingdao, at a cost of over 150 million yuan. However, after surveying in December 1951, it was discovered that the soil in Shangqiu City was loose, with a shallow layer of red silt, unsuitable for installing such large brick and tile machines. At that time, the Special Commissioner's Office considered selling the machines in Qingdao; however, because they could not find a buyer, they had to transport the machines back to Shangqiu in December 1952.

      Initially, these machines were stored in a dilapidated grain depot belonging to the Special Commissioner's Office's Grain Bureau, where the roof leaked and the interior was damp, resulting in poor storage conditions and rust. Later, after comrades offered suggestions, the storage conditions for the machines were slightly improved. In July 1953, this warehouse was in danger of collapsing, so the machines were moved to the No. 3 warehouse of the Shangqiu City Grain Company. In November, the City Grain Company needed the warehouse, and the machines were moved again to the shed where vehicles were parked at the warehouse (with wooden planks underneath).

    Regarding the problem of blindly purchasing machines, the leading comrades of the Special Commissioner's Office conducted a self-criticism. As for the handling of the machines, the Special Commissioner's Office requested instructions from our department in May and July 1953, and our department also reported to the stagnant materials exchange meeting organized by the Provincial Finance Committee for research, but no results were obtained. In October 1953 and January of this year, the warehouse inspection team of the Shangqiu City Finance Committee twice offered suggestions to the Special Commissioner's Office. On February 20th of this year, Yuan Dengyun also made criticisms about this matter, and the Finance Committee of the Special Commissioner's Office convened relevant departments to study the issue. It was decided to report the situation to higher authorities and contact other regions in order to find ways to transfer the machines elsewhere; on the other hand, efforts would be made to find someone to remove the rust and oil the machines, and to find a house to store the machines. However, it was not until April 6th that rust removal workers were found, and the house problem has not yet been resolved, with the machines still stored under the shed.

    After the People's Daily published the reader's letter of criticism on April 4th, we reported this issue to the Provincial Finance Committee and the Department of Industry. The Provincial Finance Committee has notified the Shangqiu Special Commissioner's Office to report the detailed specifications of the machines before taking further action. The above situation shows that we have not paid enough attention to this long-term backlog of state stagnant equipment, and after introducing the machines to the stagnant materials meeting, we have not continued to urge and inquire, nor have we actively studied solutions. Similar situations exist in our work: for example, the oil presses stored by the Zhengzhou Special Commissioner's Office and the coal mine boilers stored by the Anyang Special Commissioner's Office have not been handled in a timely manner (they have been reported to the Provincial Finance Committee and the Department of Industry). We are determined to strengthen the concept of cherishing state assets and actively contact all parties to study the handling of these machines, so as to avoid further losses to state property.

### 河南省财政厅准备积极处理商邱专署积压的砖瓦机

    河南省财政厅准备积极处理商邱专署积压的砖瓦机
    河南省人民政府财政厅来信反映他们对于商邱专署积压砖瓦机问题的检查情况：
    一九五一年九月，商邱专署以一亿五千余万元在青岛定购了日产四万块砖的压砖机二部，制瓦机、泥碾机各一部。但在一九五一年十二月经勘察后，发现商邱市土质松、红淤泥层浅，不适于安装这样大型的砖瓦机。当时专署曾想将机器在青岛出卖；但是因为找不到顾主，在一九五二年十二月只得将机器运回商邱。
      开始时，这些机器存放在专署粮食局所属一个屋顶漏雨、室内潮湿的废粮库里，保管条件很差，因而生了锈。后来经同志们提出意见，机器保管条件才稍有改善。一九五三年七月，这个库房有倒塌危险，把机器就搬入商邱市粮食公司第三库房内，十一月，市粮食公司需用仓库，机器又被搬到该库停放车子的席棚下边（下垫有木板）。
    对于盲目采购机器问题，专署领导同志曾作了检讨。至于机器的处理问题，一九五三年五月和七月专署曾向我厅请示，我厅也曾报告省财委所组织的呆滞材料交流会议研究，但未得结果。一九五三年十月与今年一月，商邱市财委检查仓库小组曾二次向专署提出意见，今年二月二十日袁登云对此也提出批评，专署财委又召集了有关部门研究，曾决定一面向上级反映和与外地联系，以便设法将机器外调；另一方面则找人替机器擦锈上油，并寻找存机器的房子。但到四月六日才找到擦锈工人，房子问题至今尚未解决，机器仍存在席棚下边。
    四月四日人民日报发表了读者的批评信后，我们又向省财委及工业厅反映这个问题。省财委已通知商邱专署详细报明机器规格后再作处理。以上情况说明，我们对这一长期积压国家的呆滞器材的问题是不够重视的，把机器介绍到呆滞材料会议后即未曾继续督促催问，也没有积极研究处理办法。类似情况在我们工作中还存在着：如郑州专署存放的榨油机、安阳专署存放的煤矿用锅炉，都没有得到及时处理（已向省财委和工业厅反映）。我们决心加强爱护国家资财的观念，并积极和各方面联系，研究这些机器的处理办法，免使国家财产继续遭受损失。
