    Beijing Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference Calls on All City Employees to Further Carry Out Technological Innovation Movement
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Industrial Labor Model Representative Conference, after two consecutive days of meetings on the 4th and 5th, has now successfully concluded.
    The labor model representatives who attended the meeting unanimously responded to the call to carry out the technological innovation movement. The labor model representatives who spoke at the conference included: Li Kezuo, Chief Engineer of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory; Liu Shimei, a female spinner at Qinghe Woolen Mill; Li Zhengrong, leader of the excavation team four at Fangshan Coal Mine; Liu Dezhen, former director of the steam turbine workshop at Shijingshan Power Plant; Hou Decheng, shift foreman of the No. 2 blast furnace at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant; Ni Jiying, foreman of the foundry workshop at Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory; Cheng Yongxiang, leader of the plastering team of the Engineering Company directly under the Military Commission; and Yu Kaitai, a worker at Yili Food Company. They vividly introduced their experiences in relying on the masses, working hard to study, and innovating technology with the enthusiasm and creative spirit of building a socialist society. They used concrete facts to illustrate the great significance of carrying out the technological innovation movement. For example, Li Kezuo said that the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory's production of horse-drawn harvesters this year increased sevenfold compared to the original plan, and it was relatively difficult to complete this plan. However, since the start of the technological innovation movement in February this year, the vast number of employees have put forward more than 170 rationalization proposals, which have solved many key problems in production, powerfully guaranteed the completion of the production plan, and reduced the working hours for manufacturing harvesters by 55% and the cost by 59% compared to last year. Liu Dezhen used the fact that Shijingshan Power Plant safely passed the winter peak load last year by conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts to illustrate that actively learning from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and developing the creativity of employees is one of the main contents of the technological innovation movement. Hou Decheng emphasized the importance of giving play to collective wisdom in the technological innovation movement. More than a dozen improvements made by their mechanization and automation technology research group were the result of the collective efforts of workers and technicians. He also proposed to complete the two improvements of automatic tapping machine for the iron outlet and cold air flow meter before "July 1" to celebrate the birthday of the Party. Ni Jiying said that carrying out the technological innovation movement is a powerful guarantee for overfulfilling the national plan. Their team improved 13 kinds of models in the first quarter of this year, and therefore completed the national plan 18 days ahead of schedule in the first quarter of this year. Cheng Yongxiang said that in the technological innovation movement, we must humbly learn from the advanced experience of others. Last year, their team actively learned from the advanced experience of the Shi Tingchen team, used advanced tools, and the average plastering efficiency of the whole team reached 49.77 square meters per day.
    Yin Weichen, Beijing's agricultural labor model and director of Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative, attended the conference on the 4th and congratulated the conference on behalf of 500,000 farmers in the city's suburbs. He expressed that he would learn from the working class's spirit of hard struggle, study, and creation, carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and produce more and better grain, vegetables, cotton, oil and other crops to support national construction and supply the needs of the people.
    Under the high enthusiasm of all labor model representatives actively supporting the technological innovation movement, the conference unanimously adopted the "Letter to All City Employees on Responding to the Call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to Carry Out the Technological Innovation Movement."
    The conference also passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government awarded prizes to the labor model representatives. All labor model representatives expressed their gratitude for the care and encouragement of the Party, the government, and the trade union, and promised that after returning, they would definitely play the role of locomotives in the technological innovation movement, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, study diligently, learn humbly, closely connect with the masses, and unite all employees around the Party to jointly strive for the realization of the country's socialist industrialization.
    Before the end of the conference, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, congratulated the conference and expressed his gratitude to all labor models. He encouraged the labor models to continue to carry forward the noble communist morality in their future work, on the one hand, to continue to dedicate all their abilities and wisdom to active labor, and create more material and spiritual wealth for the country and society, and on the other hand, to cherish public property and save national resources bit by bit. In this way, using their own advanced behavior to drive all employees and all working people to jointly carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation, and gradually build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society. Comrade Peng Zhen briefly described the work situation in Beijing. He said: The work in various aspects of the city has achieved certain results, but some comrades only see the achievements and do not see the shortcomings and errors, and do not use a higher level to demand their own work, but use a lower scale to measure their own work, so a "just about right" mentality has grown relatively universally, and this mentality is a reflection of bourgeois ideology; in fact, our work is still far from good enough in any aspect. If we do not resolutely criticize and conscientiously overcome this arrogant and complacent mood that we think our work is already "just about right," the city's work will stagnate. He said that the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Government are currently inspecting the shortcomings and errors in the leadership and work of various departments of the city in order to overcome these shortcomings and errors and promote our work. He hopes that labor models will boldly expose the shortcomings in the work of the city and their own units and assist in improvement. Finally, he hoped that labor models will also constantly expose and overcome their own shortcomings and errors in their work, and constantly find and learn from the advanced experiences of others, other units, and other regions, so as to constantly improve themselves and improve their work. Only in this way can they constantly progress and continue to maintain the glory of labor models.

    北京工业劳动模范代表大会号召全市职工
    进一步开展技术革新运动
    【本报讯】北京市工业劳动模范代表大会，经过四、五日两天连续开会，现已胜利结束。
    到会的劳动模范代表一致响应开展技术革新运动的号召。在大会上发言的劳动模范代表有：华北农业机械总厂总工程师李克佐、清河制呢厂细纱女工刘世梅、房山煤矿掘进四组班长李正荣、石景山发电厂原汽机车间主任刘德珍、石景山钢铁厂第二高炉值班工长侯德成、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间工长倪吉英、军委直属工程公司抹灰小组长程永祥、义利食品公司工人俞开泰等。他们生动地介绍了自己如何以建设社会主义社会的热情和创造精神，依靠群众，刻苦钻研，革新技术的经验。他们用具体的事实说明开展技术革新运动的重大意义。例如李克佐说，华北农业机械总厂今年生产的马拉收割机比原计划提高了七倍，要完成这个计划是比较困难的。但是，从今年二月起开展了技术革新运动，广大职工提出了一百七十多件合理化建议，解决了生产上许多关键问题，有力地保证了生产计划的完成，并使制造收割机的工时比去年减少了百分之五十五，成本降低了百分之五十九。刘德珍通过石景山发电厂去年认真执行苏联专家建议，安全度过冬季高峰负荷的事实，说明积极学习苏联先进的科学技术，认真贯彻苏联专家建议，发扬职工的创造性，就是技术革新运动的主要内容之一。侯德成着重说明在技术革新运动中发挥集体智慧的重要性。他们机械化自动化技术研究小组的十多项改进，都是工人、技术人员集体努力的结果。他并提出要在“七一”以前完成出铁口自动打眼机、冷风流量表两项改进，来庆祝党的生日。倪吉英说，开展技术革新运动是超额完成国家计划的有力保证，他们小组今年第一季度又改进了十三种模型，因而今年第一季度提前十八天完成了国家计划。程永祥说，在技术革新运动中一定要虚心学习别人的先进经验。去年他们小组积极学习史廷臣小组的先进经验，使用先进工具，全组抹灰效率平均每天达到四十九点七七平方公尺。
    北京市农业劳动模范、黄土岗农业生产合作社主任殷维臣四日参加大会，代表全市郊区五十万农民向大会祝贺。他表示要学习工人阶级艰苦奋斗、钻研创造的精神，开展互助合作运动，生产更多更好的粮食、蔬菜、棉花、油料等作物来支援国家建设和供应人民需要。
    大会在全体劳动模范代表积极拥护开展技术革新运动的高涨热情下，一致通过了“为响应中华全国总工会号召开展技术革新运动告全市职工书”。
    大会还通过了向毛主席致敬电。
    北京市人民政府向劳动模范代表颁发了奖品。全体劳动模范代表对党、政府和工会的关心和鼓励表示感谢，并保证在回去以后，一定在技术革新运动中起到火车头的作用，戒骄戒躁，刻苦钻研，虚心学习，密切联系群众，把全体职工团结在党的周围，共同为实现国家社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    大会结束前，中共北京市委员会书记彭真向大会致贺，并向全体劳动模范表示感谢。他勉励劳动模范在今后工作中继续发扬高贵的共产主义的道德品质，一方面要继续献出全部的能力和智慧积极劳动，为国家为社会创造更多的物质和精神财富，另一方面要爱护公共财物，一点一滴地节约国家资财。这样用自己的先进行为来带动全体职工和全体劳动人民，共同进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造，逐步地把我们国家建设成为繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。彭真同志扼要地叙述了北京市的工作情况。他说：本市各方面的工作是有一定成绩的，但是有些同志光看到成绩而看不到缺点和错误，不是用更高的水平来要求自己的工作，而是用较低的尺度来衡量自己的工作，因而就比较普遍地滋长了一种“差不多”的思想，这种思想是资产阶级思想的反映；其实，我们的工作现在不论在哪一方面都还是差得很多的。如不坚决批判和认真克服这种自以为工作已经“差不多”的骄傲自满情绪，就会使本市工作停滞不前。他说，目前市委和市人民政府正在检查市的领导和各部门工作中的缺点和错误，以便克服这些缺点和错误推进我们的工作，希望劳动模范大胆揭发本市和本单位工作中的缺点，并协助改进。最后他希望劳动模范也不断地揭发和克服自己在工作中的缺点和错误，不断地寻找和学习别人、别的单位和别的地区的先进经验，以不断地提高自己和改进工作，只有这样，才能使自己不断地进步和继续保持劳动模范的光荣。
