Tea Producing Areas in Central and Southern Provinces
    Enter Tense Stage of Spring Tea Picking and Production
    The spring tea picking and production work in the tea producing areas of the Central and Southern provinces is entering a tense stage. Some areas are nearing completion and are actively preparing for summer tea production. The Central and Southern region is one of the main tea producing areas in China, especially the black tea and green tea produced in Jiangxi and Hunan, which are well-known at home and abroad. This year, before the spring tea picking and production, all provinces trained a large number of tea farmers and promoted tea-making tools. Hunan Province has trained 3,180 tea farmers and promoted 905 tea rolling machines and 28,200 baking cages. Jiangxi and the southern tea producing areas of Hubei held tea farmer representative meetings at the county level. Henan held a tea production technology symposium. At these meetings, experiences were exchanged and new technologies were learned. And a standard of "rational picking" was put forward in light of local conditions. In addition, "Huangchuan Maojian" in Henan, "Ninghong" and "Raolv" in Jiangxi, etc., have all paid attention to improving production methods, laying a favorable foundation for the future development of tea production.

    中南各省产茶地区
    采制春茶进入紧张阶段
    中南各省产茶地区的春茶采制工作，正进入紧张阶段。部分地区已接近尾声，正积极准备夏茶的生产工作。中南区是我国出产茶叶的主要地区之一，特别是江西、湖南出产的红茶和绿茶，在国内外都很著名。今年在春茶采制前，各省都训练了大批茶农，推广了制茶工具。湖南省已训练茶农三千一百八十人，推广揉茶机九百零五部，焙笼二万八千二百个。江西及湖北南部产茶区都以县为单位召开了茶农代表会。河南召开了茶叶生产技术座谈会，这些会上，都交流了经验，学习了新技术。并因地制宜地提出了“合理采摘”的标准。此外，如河南的“潢川毛尖”、江西的“宁红”、“饶绿”等，都注意改进了制作方法，为今后发展茶叶生产打下有利的基础。（高长任）
