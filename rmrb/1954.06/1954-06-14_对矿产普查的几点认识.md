    Some Understandings of Mineral Prospecting
    Li Chunyu, Chief Engineer of the North China Geological Bureau
    Large-scale mineral prospecting work has started this year. Although the main force of the geological department has been focused on key exploration in the past few years, it has also done some mineral prospecting work to varying degrees. From these works, we have corrected, enriched, and improved our understanding of mineral prospecting, which is helpful for the development of mineral prospecting work in the future.
    First, we have clarified that mineral prospecting is to prepare for key exploration and is one of the scientific procedures of geological exploration. It is difficult to avoid blindness if key exploration is carried out without mineral prospecting. Although the current focus of exploration is mostly on locations that have been discovered before, many of these locations have undergone mineral prospecting, and key exploration was arranged only after a correct understanding of the mineral deposit. For example, there is a copper mine that we have always regarded as an iron mine for many years. After mineral prospecting in 1951, theoretical research was carried out, and exploration confirmed that it is a pyrite-type copper mine with economic value. There is also a coalfield that everyone already knew about, but the law of coal seam thickness changes was unclear. After prospecting, the direction of the ore body's progress was clarified, and the location of exploration and the direction of future development were determined. As for those areas with absolutely no clues, it is unimaginable to rashly arrange key exploration without mineral prospecting. We also had many lessons in this regard in the past. Often, in order to achieve quick results, exploration designs were made based on incomplete data, and the geological conditions often did not match the original assumptions. As a result, either the original design was changed, or the expected results were not obtained. This year, one of our coalfield exploration teams is in this situation. It was originally thought that the coalfield was very simple, and there were many small kilns nearby. As a result, within a distance of 1,200 meters, there were more than a dozen faults of various sizes, which cut the coalfield into a more disorderly state. The coal seams were also thin, and the reserves were reduced, so it was necessary to relocate the exploration, wasting the state's investment and delaying the time. Therefore, the mineral prospecting work stage cannot be skipped.
    Second, many minerals in China were discovered a long time ago, and many minerals can be recognized by the general public. Therefore, some people think that mineral prospecting is a very simple task. Practical experience tells us that this is not the case. Mineral prospecting is a large-area work, and it is necessary to understand the relationship of geological structures and the changes in rocks, and to evaluate mineral deposits from geological laws. Without a certain geological theoretical training and experience in mineral prospecting, it is difficult to correctly understand mineral deposits, and it is often a case of losing sight of one thing while paying attention to another. After walking dozens of miles, the observed phenomena cannot be connected. Moreover, the area is large, the phenomena encountered are numerous, and the problems are complex, so mineral prospecting can never be regarded as a very simple task. Some people also think that mineral prospecting is a very complex task, and it must be participated in by people with geological theory and practical experience. This is also incorrect and unrealistic. If this is the requirement, there will be no power to carry out large-scale mineral prospecting work, and it will not be able to meet the needs of the country. Our experience is that in a certain area, a skilled geologist can lead several geological work groups, first concentrating on one place for research, reaching a common understanding of the geology, making stratigraphic sections, unifying the division of strata, identifying rock properties, and understanding the relationship between changes, mineral deposits, and surrounding rocks, etc. Then, each group starts work separately, recording the observation results point by point, and then the skilled geologist checks, comprehensively researches, and introduces the research results to all geological workers at any time. This can not only ensure the progress and quality but also specifically help the learning of young geological workers.
    Third, mineral prospecting is not key exploration. In the absence of encountering ore bodies with industrial value, it is not necessary to measure and draw large-scale detailed geological maps. Therefore, some people think that mineral prospecting does not require a formal geological team, and strict requirements can be waived. If a mine is found, just take a look at it; if there is no mine, just walk away. There is also no need to make geological maps or route geological maps, which is incorrect. The so-called "finding a mine" is not about whether there are outcrops, but about geological inferences. If the area passed through does not have a geological map or route geological map, but is hurriedly passed through like a "wandering Taoist," it is impossible to connect the geological conditions and impossible to have correct theoretical inferences. Some people do make geological maps, but they do not systematically fill in geological maps. Instead, after running for a day or a few days, they record what they remember, piecemeal, on the map. In this way, there cannot be a comprehensive and correct understanding of the geological conditions of an area. We must understand that mineral prospecting is a basic work in geology and must start with the formal and systematic filling in of geological maps. In this way, there can be a more comprehensive understanding of an area, and a more correct evaluation of the minerals in this area, so as not to run in vain and return empty-handed.
    Fourth, according to our experience in field work over the past few years, mineral prospecting work must obtain the support of the broad masses and party and government at all levels. In November last year, the North China Geological Bureau invited representatives from various counties in the North China mountain area to hold a mass mineral reporting meeting, introducing some ore conditions and distributing dozens of rock and mineral specimens to help everyone understand minerals. After the meeting, the number of letters and mineral samples sent by the masses increased significantly compared with before. Once, when we were prospecting in Yaoxian, Shaanxi, we were very hot and thirsty. That area is on the Loess Plateau and is very short of water. We had to fetch water from a place more than ten miles away to drink, but the villagers knew that we were looking for minerals, so they boiled water for us to drink. In 1952, an engineer from the North China Geological Bureau introduced to the masses in the field that malachite was a clue to finding copper mines. Last year, when he went to Chicheng to work, an old man recognized him and told him that he had discovered malachite, and personally took him up the mountain to investigate. These all show that the masses are enthusiastically supporting mineral prospecting work, and this force cannot be ignored.

    对矿产普查的几点认识
    华北地质局总工程师  李春昱
    大规模的矿产普查工作从今年开始了。过去几年来地质部门的主要力量虽然是放在重点勘探上，但多多少少也作了一些矿产普查工作，从这些工作中端正了、丰富了和提高了我们对矿产普查的认识，这是有助于今后矿产普查工作的开展的。
    首先，我们明确了矿产普查是给重点勘探作准备的，是地质勘探的科学程序之一，不作矿产普查就进行重点勘探是难以避免盲目性的。现在勘探的重点虽然大都是以前已发现的地点，但这些地点有许多是经过矿产普查，对矿床有了正确的认识，然后才布置重点勘探的。例如有一个铜矿，多年来我们一直把它当作铁矿，经过一九五一年的矿产普查，从理论上加以研究，并经过勘探，证实了是一个有经济价值的黄铁矿型铜矿。又有一个煤田，本来是大家已经知道的，但对煤层厚薄变化的规律是不清楚的，经过普查之后，摸清了矿体进展的方向，才确定了勘探的地点和今后发展的方向。至于那些完全没有线索的地区，不进行矿产普查就贸然布置重点勘探，更是不可想像的事，过去我们在这方面也有许多教训，常常为了急于求成，根据不完全的资料即作勘探设计，而地质情况往往和原来的预想不符，因而不是变更原有设计，就是得不到预期效果。今年我们有一个煤田勘探队便是这样的情况，本来以为煤田是很简单的，而且附近还有很多小窑，结果在一千二百公尺的距离内，大大小小的断层竟有十几条，把煤田割得更凌乱，煤层也薄，储量因而减少，不得不迁地勘探，浪费了国家的投资，而且推延了时间，因此，矿产普查的工作阶段是不能超越的。
    第二，中国许多矿是在很久以前就被发现了的，许多矿是一般群众也可以认识的。因而有人就以为矿产普查是一项很简单的工作。实际经验告诉我们，事实并不如此。矿产普查是一个大面积的工作，必须了解地质构造关系，岩石变化情况，从地质规律作出矿床评价。没有一定地质理论修养和矿产普查的经验，就难以正确地认识矿床，并往往顾此失彼，走了几十里路，观察到的现象连结不起来，而且面积大了，所遇到的现象多了，问题也复杂了，决不能把矿产普查当作很简单的工作。也有人认为矿产普查是很复杂的工作，必须都是有地质理论和实际经验的人参加才行。这也是不对的，不切实际的。如果这样来要求的话，就没有力量开展大规模的矿产普查工作，不能适应国家的需要。我们的经验是在一定的地区内可以由一个熟练的地质工作者率领几个地质工作组，先集中在一处进行研究，对地质取得了共同认识，作出地层剖面，统一划分地层，鉴定岩石性质，了解变化现象、矿床和围岩的关系等等，然后各组分头展开工作，把观察结果逐点记录，再由熟练的地质工作者检查，综合研究，并随时把研究的结果介绍给全体地质工作人员。这样既可以保证进度和质量，也具体地帮助了青年地质工作者的学习。
    第三，矿产普查不是重点勘探，在没有遇到有工业价值的矿体时，不需要测制大比例尺的详细地质图。因此有人认为矿产普查不需要一个正规的地质队伍，可以不作严格要求，找着矿就看看，没有矿就走路，也不需作地质图或路线地质图，这是不对的。所谓“找着矿”，不是有没有露头，而是要根据地质理论推断的，如果所经过的地区，不作地质图或路线地质图，而是像“云游道人”式地匆匆走过，则不可能把地质情况联系起来，不可能有正确的理论推断。也有人虽作地质图，但不是有系统地填绘地质图，而是在一天或几天跑完之后，就记忆所及，东鳞西爪记在图上，这样对一个区域的地质情况也不能有一个全面的和正确的认识。我们必须了解矿产普查是地质学里一项基本工作，一定要从正式的、有系统地填绘地质图作起，这样对一个地区才能有较全面的认识，对这一个地区的矿产才能有较正确的评价，才不致白跑一趟，空手而回。
    第四，根据几年来我们在野外工作的经验，矿产普查工作必须取得广大群众和各级党、政的支持。去年十一月华北地质局邀请华北山区各县派遣代表，召开了一次群众报矿会议，介绍了一些矿石情况，分发了数十种岩石矿物的标本，借以帮助大家对矿物的认识。会后群众报矿来信和送来的矿样较以前显著增加。有一次，我们在陕西耀县进行普查，走得又热又渴，那一带在黄土高原上，非常缺水，要到十里以外的地方挑水喝，但老乡们知道我们是找矿的，就烧了开水给我们喝。华北地质局有一个工程师一九五二年在野外工作时，向群众介绍过孔雀石是寻找铜矿的线索，去年他到赤城工作时，有一位老乡还认识他，并告诉他自己发现了孔雀石，亲自带他上山勘察。这些都说明了群众是热烈支持矿产普查工作的，这支力量是不能忽视的。
