Henan and Shaanxi Provinces Begin Harvesting Wheat

    Wheat harvesting has begun in Henan Province. Along the Huai River, the Yellow River, and both sides of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways, the joyous laughter of farmers celebrating the harvest can be heard everywhere. The average yield per mu of wheat in Xinxiang Special District this year is expected to increase from 117 jin per mu last year to 121.9 jin. The several thousand mu of wheat already harvested in the hilly areas of the 30 townships in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City generally show an increase of about 10% compared to last year.
    The characteristics of this year's summer harvest and planting in the province are thorough preparation and good soil moisture. Therefore, farmers are mostly organized to harvest wheat on one hand and plant while the soil moisture is good, striving for continued increases in autumn crop production. Xinxiang Special District requires farmers to expand the area of replanting, widely promote improved varieties, increase fertilizer application, and plant in a timely manner to increase yield per unit area, striving to increase autumn crop production by 7% compared to last year. Currently, the summer harvest and planting in the counties near the Taihang Mountains in the special district have entered a climax. The Xiazaozhuang Increased Production Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the first district of Ji County revised its summer harvest and planting plan, arranged labor, and on the first day harvested 55 mu of wheat and planted immediately. In addition, they also intercropped 15 mu while the soil moisture was good, driving all the mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the village to take action together, and they followed up harvesting with planting on more than 300 mu in half a day. According to statistics from 18 mutual aid teams in Juyuan Village and Dazhancheng Village in Huojia County, the autumn planting area this year will be expanded by 759 mu compared to last year, which can increase grain production by 68,000 jin; at the same time, all late autumn land will be planted with improved varieties, with close planting and increased fertilizer application, and the yield per unit area is also required to increase by 50 jin per mu compared to last year. The "Tongsheng Agricultural Producers' Cooperative" in Mengjin County, Luoyang Special District, organized the labor force of the entire cooperative to implement a continuous operation method of harvesting, threshing, and distributing at the same time. During the harvest, millet, corn, and beans are planted in a timely manner, and at the same time, some labor is allocated to autumn field management. (Lü Jianzhong)

    It is estimated that Shaanxi Province will have a bumper harvest of winter wheat this year. Based on the actual growth of wheat in some areas and the results of field predictions, if there are no unexpected disasters during the harvest, the total wheat output this year is expected to reach 3,672 million jin, an increase of 5.82% compared to last year. The average yield per mu will be 155.7 jin, an increase of 3.16% compared to last year.
    The reasons for the overall bumper harvest of winter wheat in Shaanxi Province this year are: farmers' enthusiasm increased after the propaganda of the General Line, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations developed. Cultivation techniques have been widely promoted in various places, and the Bima No. 1 improved wheat variety, which is suitable for growth in Guanzhong, has been promoted to more than 7 million mu this year. The No. 6028 variety, which avoids wheat midge damage, has been replanted in the humid areas along the river. Although the wheat midge damage was more serious this year than last year, the Guanzhong area did a lot of prevention and control work early with a large amount of chemical powder, which greatly reduced the pest damage. In addition, the expansion of fertilizer sources, the implementation of close planting, and timely rainfall have created conditions for a bumper harvest.
    Various places in Shaanxi Province have made more adequate preparations for the summer harvest this year. The Xingping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has supplied about three times as much means of production as in the same period last year, and two-thirds of the reserves are still being promoted. The CCP Wu Gong, Pu Cheng, and Qi Shan County Committees solved the problem of mutual benefit among farmers in the summer harvest and promoted simple and easy-to-implement methods of calculating work points and accounts. Eight agricultural producers' cooperative accountants in Heyang County learned three new types of accounting books before the summer harvest. The CCP Baoji Prefectural Committee convened 26 agricultural producers' cooperative accountants and resident cadres to jointly study the summer harvest distribution methods.
    Winter wheat in the Guanzhong area began to be harvested on May 18th and entered the climax of the summer harvest around the end of May. (Gen Di)

    河南陕西两省开始收割小麦
    河南省的麦收开始了。沿淮河、黄河两岸和京汉、陇海铁路两侧，到处都可以听到农民们丰收的欢笑。新乡专区今年小麦的单位面积产量可由去年每亩平均一百一十七斤增至一百二十一斤九两。郑州市郊区三十个乡山岗地已收割的数千亩小麦一般都比去年增产一成左右。
    今年全省夏收夏种的特点是准备充分，墒情又好。因此农民大都是有组织地一面收麦，一面趁墒播种，争取大秋作物继续增产。新乡专区要求农民扩大复播面积，普遍推广良种，增施肥料，适时播种以提高单位面积产量。争取大秋作物产量比去年提高百分之七。现在该专区靠近太行山麓各县夏收夏种已进入高潮。汲县一区下枣庄增产农业生产合作社修订夏收夏种计划，安排劳力，第一天收完了五十五亩小麦，随时就播种完毕，另外还趁墒串种了十五亩，带动全村互助组和单干农民一齐出动，半天就随收随种了三百多亩。获嘉县据原村、大占城两村十八个互助组统计：今年秋季播种面积比去年扩大了七百五十九亩，可增产粮食六万八千斤；同时晚秋地全部播种良种，实行密植和增施肥料，单位面积产量也要求每亩比去年增加五十斤。洛阳专区孟津县“同升农业生产合作社”组织全社劳力实行边收边打边分配的连环作业法，在收割中，及时播种谷子、玉米和豆子，同时分配一部分劳力进行秋田管理。（吕建中）

    陕西省今年冬小麦预计可以丰收。依据目前部分地区小麦实际生长情况和田间预测的结果，如在收获时无意外灾害，今年小麦总产量可望达到三十六亿七千二百多万市斤，较去年提高百分之五点八二。平均每亩产量将为一百五十五点七斤，比去年提高百分之三点一六。
    陕西省今年冬小麦全面丰收的原因是：总路线宣传后农民积极性提高了，互助合作组织发展了。各地普遍推广了耕作技术，适宜关中生长的碧蚂一号小麦良种，今年推广到七百万亩以上。沿河潮湿地带改播避免吸浆虫为害的六○二八号品种。今年吸浆虫为害虽较去年严重，但关中地区以大量化学药粉及早做好防治工作，大大减少了虫害。加上肥源扩大、推行密植和雨水及时等，为丰收创造了条件。
    陕西省各地今年夏收的准备工作较充分。兴平县供销合作社已供应生产资料约为去年同期三倍，还有三分之二的储备品正在推销。中共武功、蒲城、岐山等县委，解决了夏收中农民间的互利问题，推广了简单易行的计工算账办法。郃阳县八个农业生产合作社会计在夏收前学会了三种新式账簿。中共宝鸡地委召集了二十六个农业生产合作社会计和驻社干部，共同研究了夏收分配办法。
    关中区冬小麦于五月十八日开始收割，五月底前后进入夏收高潮。（根蒂）
