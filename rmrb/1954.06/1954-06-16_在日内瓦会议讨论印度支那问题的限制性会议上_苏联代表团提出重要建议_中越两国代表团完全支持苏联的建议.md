Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 14th: At the restricted session of the Geneva Conference on June 14, the nine-nation delegations continued to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The next restricted session on this issue will be held on June 16.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 14th: This agency’s special correspondent reports: The nine-nation delegations held a restricted session on the 14th to continue discussing the Indochina issue.

According to obtained information, the Soviet delegation made significant constructive efforts at the meeting on the 14th to resolve differences of opinion from all parties in the past two weeks of meetings, in order to reach an agreement on the issue of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. The Soviet delegation put forward an important proposal, making clear and reasonable provisions for the composition, scope of authority, general rules, and international guarantees of the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for supervising the Indochina armistice. The Soviet delegation's proposal is as follows:

	I. Joint Commission (Military Armistice Commission)
	Composition:
	1. The Joint Commission (Military Armistice Commission) shall be composed of an equal number of representatives from both commands. The chief commissioner of the Joint Commission shall be a general-level officer. The Joint Commission shall establish joint inspection teams composed of an equal number of personnel from both sides (the number to be agreed upon by both sides).
	Authority:
	2. The responsibilities of the Joint Commission are to supervise the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement. The main terms are as follows:
		(1) Supervise the accurate execution of the adjustment of areas and the plan for the concentration of armed forces by both sides;
		(2) Supervise the simultaneous, comprehensive, and complete ceasefire;
		(3) Consult and resolve various issues related to any violation of the terms of the armistice agreement.
	3. The Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Commission have a parallel rather than subordinate relationship. The two commissions cooperate according to the division of labor within the scope of their authority stipulated in the armistice agreement to ensure the effective implementation of the armistice agreement.

	II. Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
	Composition:
	4. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission for supervising the implementation of the terms of the Indochina armistice agreement shall be composed of representatives from countries such as…
	The definition of "neutral countries" used here refers to those countries that do not have armed forces participating in the hostile actions in Indochina.
	The commission shall be composed of an equal number of representatives designated by the above-mentioned neutral countries.
	The commission shall establish inspection teams composed of an equal number of officers designated by each neutral country.
	Authority:
	5. The responsibilities of the Neutral Nations Commission are to observe, supervise, inspect, and investigate the implementation of the various terms of the armistice agreement. Its main terms are as follows:
		(1) Supervise the implementation of the regulations regarding the demarcation of military demarcation lines and the establishment of demilitarized zones by both sides according to the armistice agreement;
		(2) Supervise the troop transfer work carried out for the adjustment of areas;
		(3) Supervise the work of mutual repatriation of prisoners of war and detained civilians;
		(4) At the request of both sides or one side of the Joint Commission, investigate and verify incidents in the demilitarized zone that violate the armistice agreement and make recommendations for correction to both sides;
		(5) Supervise the cessation of the entry of all new armed forces and military personnel, as well as various weapons, ammunition, and military technical equipment from outside Indochina at the agreed sea, land, and air ports in Indochina;
		(6) Provide possible amendments and supplements to the terms of the agreement in order to ensure the more effective implementation of the armistice agreement.
	The Neutral Nations Commission performs its duties through inspection teams stationed at various locations stipulated in the armistice agreement.
	General Rules:
	6. The Neutral Nations Commission for supervising the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement shall make decisions with the appropriate consent of all commissioners.
	The commission shall notify the Joint Commission of its decisions; the Joint Commission shall take appropriate measures accordingly, or return it to the Neutral Nations Commission for reconsideration. If this review does not yield results, the Neutral Nations Commission shall immediately notify the Joint Commission and the guarantor countries.
	If disagreements arise within the Neutral Nations Commission when reviewing a matter related to the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement, the entire commission or individual commissioners shall report the issues under mediation, including the positions of each member state of the commission, to the Joint Commission and the guarantor countries.
	If both sides of the Joint Commission are unable to resolve the disagreement on this issue, the guarantor countries shall immediately take appropriate measures to eliminate incidents of violation of the agreement or the threat of such incidents.
	7. It is stipulated that decisions on the following issues must be made without disagreement in the commission:
		A. Issues related to incidents that violate the terms of the agreement or create a threat of violation of the agreement (including the invasion of territory, territorial waters, and airspace by the armed forces of all parties) that may cause the resurgence of hostilities;
		B. Issues related to amending and supplementing the terms of the armistice agreement.
	8. Decisions on the following issues can be made by a simple majority vote:
		A. Issues related to the commission's exercise of its authority to prohibit the entry of new armed forces—army, air force, navy—various weapons (assembled or disassembled), ready-made ammunition, and various military technical equipment from outside Indochina;
		B. Issues related to investigating incidents of violation of the armistice agreement alleged by the Joint Commission or one party;
		C. Other issues within the scope of the Neutral Nations Commission's authority.
	When mediating the above-mentioned issues, once the votes are equally divided, the chairman's vote shall be decisive.
	9. Investigations by the Neutral Nations Commission in places other than those stipulated in the armistice agreement can be conducted immediately after agreement with the commander of the relevant party.
	10. The Neutral Nations Commission shall formulate its rules of procedure in accordance with this resolution.

	III. International Guarantees
	11. The countries participating in the Geneva Conference undertake to guarantee the implementation of the armistice agreement.
	12. When the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are unable to take appropriate measures to eliminate incidents of violation or threat of violation of the armistice agreement in Indochina, as well as the threat of the resurgence of hostilities arising therefrom, the countries participating in the guarantee agreement shall immediately convene a meeting for consultation to take collective measures to guarantee the implementation of the agreement.

As previously reported, in the past two weeks, the meeting has been discussing the issue of establishing a Joint Commission and a Neutral Nations Commission to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement, as outlined in the six proposals of the Chinese delegation. The discussion indicated that all participating countries recognized the need to establish a Joint Commission and a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the necessary agreement has not yet been reached among the participating countries regarding the authority of the above-mentioned commissions and the procedures that the Neutral Nations Commission should follow to make decisions.

It is reported that at the meeting on the 14th, the Soviet delegation believed that the necessity of the Joint Commission having these authorities arises from the nature of the armistice agreement itself. Compliance with the agreement is primarily the task of both parties. Therefore, they should bear the primary responsibility for the implementation of the agreement. If any party does not comply with the various provisions of this agreement, then no neutral nations commission can guarantee the implementation of the agreement.

Regarding the issue of the relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Soviet delegation pointed out that the Soviet delegation still maintains that these commissions should cooperate with each other in their work in the closest possible manner, but the work of one commission should not depend on the actions of the other commission. Otherwise, it may only cause unnecessary confusion regarding the relationship between the commissions and have a negative impact on these commissions completing their direct tasks. The view that one commission should be subordinate to another commission is fundamentally wrong. The implication of this view is that the Joint Commission should act on the orders of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In this case, what is the backing for the order? Military force? Troops? This would be suggesting that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should have troops in Indochina and occupy the area under discussion, which is not in line with the purpose of restoring peace in Indochina.

Regarding the issue of the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and how to make decisions within the commission, the meeting encountered the greatest difficulties during the discussion process. The Soviet delegation pointed out that one-sidedness must not be allowed when deciding on the composition of the commission. Otherwise, the Neutral Nations Commission cannot be regarded as an impartial body that acts in consideration of the interests of both parties. The Soviet delegation believes that in the issue of how the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission makes decisions, it is necessary to consider the various issues that the commission will review. One-sidedness should not be allowed when making certain decisions, especially on issues that greatly involve the interests of both parties. The Soviet delegation agrees with the possibility that the commission can use the majority voting method to make decisions on certain issues. In this case, the special role of the chairman of the commission is stipulated, that is, in the case of an equal division of votes among the members of the commission, the chairman's vote has a decisive meaning. The Soviet delegation further stated that in the list of four neutral countries that the Soviet Union has proposed, India can serve as the chairman of the commission.

The Soviet delegation pointed out when making the above-mentioned suggestions that the Soviet delegation took into account the statements made by other meeting participants when discussing the issue of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. The Soviet delegation believes that this suggestion will help us reach an agreement on this important issue, which will first promote the reaching of agreements on other issues related to the restoration of peace in Indochina.

It is reported that the Soviet delegation's proposal received the full support of the delegation of the People's Republic of China and the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Chinese delegation pointed out at today's meeting that in the recent conferences, some delegations were not interested in the common points of various opinions, but tried to expand on many differences, making it difficult to approach, and even intentionally creating some artificial deadlocks to create an excuse for certain attempts. The Chinese delegation stated that it is still willing to continue to work hard, seek methods, and overcome difficulties so that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible.

The Chinese delegation supports the Soviet delegation's proposal, believing that this proposal is fair, reasonable, and can solve practical problems. The Chinese delegation also expressed that it does not object to consultations outside the meeting based on the Soviet delegation's proposal on the issue of the composition of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to obtain a solution.

Regarding the issue of the relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the Chinese delegation believes that the Indochina armistice should basically rely on the sincerity of both parties. If the active role of the Joint Commission composed of representatives of the commands of both parties is erased, it is expressing distrust in the sincerity of the warring parties in demanding an armistice. Differences in the relationship between the two commissions should be overcome by dividing the scope of authority of the two commissions. The Soviet delegation's proposal has clearly stipulated the scope of authority of the two commissions. The Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be parallel rather than subordinate institutions. The Chinese delegation pointed out that the U.S. delegation's argument is untenable. Since it recognizes the necessity of the warring parties' sincerity in the armistice, it cannot deny the major role that the Joint Commission will play in the armistice.

Regarding the principle of unanimous agreement and the method of majority voting, the Chinese delegation believes that the Soviet delegation's proposal appropriately divides and coordinates the principle of unanimous agreement and the method of majority voting, thus providing a basis that is most likely to reach an agreement. This conference should accept the Soviet delegation's proposal as the basis for discussion in order to quickly reach an agreement on the issues of armistice supervision and international guarantees.

The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in announcing its support for the Soviet delegation's proposal, emphasized that the relationship between the Joint Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be parallel rather than the former being subordinate to the latter. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that only the Joint Commission is fully equipped with the necessary conditions to smoothly implement the armistice agreement.

At the meeting, some people believed that the warring parties in Indochina have been fighting for eight years, making it difficult to effectively implement the armistice agreement. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out that when the French and Vietnamese sides signed preliminary agreements and provisional agreements eight years ago, the French side still considered itself the stronger party and attempted to conquer Vietnam by force. But since then, in the eight years of war, many people have learned their lessons. Today, the vast majority of officers and soldiers of the French expeditionary force fighting in Indochina hope and demand peace because they understand that war is of no benefit to their country; and they believe that it is a sin not to obtain peace when there is an opportunity to obtain it under glorious conditions. The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that once the armistice agreement is concluded, the vast majority of officers and soldiers of the French expeditionary force are willing to implement it. As for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it has consistently demanded peace. It will sincerely and strictly implement all the terms of the armistice agreement.

The Soviet delegation's proposal and the opinions of the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam provide a way to resolve the differences of the past two weeks and reach an agreement quickly. As long as there is no intention to disrupt the meeting, there is no reason not to adopt the Soviet delegation's proposal. However, according to obtained information, the representatives of some Western countries, led by the United States, are not interested in reaching an agreement. The U.S. representative hurriedly adopted an attitude of negating everything without seriously studying the Soviet delegation's proposal. The U.S. representative even described the reasonable division of the voting procedures of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in the Soviet proposal as complicating the issue. The British representative, one of the chairmen of the meeting, did not express that he would work towards reaching an agreement based on the Soviet delegation's constructive proposal, but instead doubted whether it would be advisable to continue the discussion, and said that it could be considered to adjourn the meeting for a period of time. Observers here clearly see that the delegations of some Western countries, led by the United States, are intentionally creating artificial obstacles to prevent any agreement from being reached.

It is reported that at the meeting on the 14th, some representatives mentioned the issues of Cambodia and Laos. The delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet Union stated that they did not object to discussing the issues of these two countries at future meetings, but hoped that this would not hinder the discussion of the current issues.

    在日内瓦会议讨论印度支那问题的限制性会议上
    苏联代表团提出重要建议
    中越两国代表团完全支持苏联的建议
    【新华社日内瓦十四日电】在日内瓦会议六月十四日的限制性会议中，九国代表团继续讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。下次关于这一问题的限制性会议将在六月十六日举行。
   【新华社日内瓦十四日电】本社特派记者报道：九国代表团十四日举行限制性会议，继续讨论印度支那问题。
    据已获得的消息说，苏联代表团在十四日的会议上作了重大的建设性的努力，谋求解决在过去两周的会议中各方面的意见分歧，以期在关于履行停战协定的监察问题上达成协议。苏联代表团提出了一个重要建议，对监督印度支那停战的联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的组成、职权范围、一般规则以及国际保证等问题，作了明确而合理的规定。苏联代表团的建议如下：
    壹、联合委员会（军事停战委员会）
    组成：
    一、联合委员会（军事停战委员会）由双方司令部同等数目的代表组成。联合委员会首席委员应为将级人员。联合委员会设立由双方同等人数组成的联合视察小组（其数目由双方议定）。
    职权：
    二、联合委员会的职责为监督停战协定条款的履行。其中主要条款如下：
    （1）监督双方地区调整及武装力量集结计划的确切执行；
    （2）监督同时、全面并完全的停火；
    （3）协商解决各种有关任何违反停战协定条款的问题。
    三、联合委员会与中立国委员会系平行而非隶属的关系。两委员会根据停战协定规定的职权范围分工合作，以保障停战协定的有效实施。
    贰、中立国监察委员会
    组成：
    四、监察履行印度支那停战协定条款的中立国监察委员会由……等国代表组成。
    这里所用“中立国家”一词的定义，系指那些没有武装力量参加印度支那敌对行动的国家。
    该委员会由上述各该中立国所指定的同等数目的代表组成。
    该委员会设立由各中立国指定的同等数目的军官组成的视察小组。
    职权：
    五、中立国委员会的职责是，对停战协定各条款的执行进行观察、监察、视察和调查。其主要条款如下：
    （1）监察双方根据停战协定实施关于划分军事分界线和建立非军事区的规定；
    （2）监察为调整地区而进行的部队转移工作；
    （3）监察互相遣返战俘和被拘平民的工作；
    （4）根据联合委员会双方或者一方的要求，调查和审定非军事区违反停战协定的事件，并向双方提出纠正建议；
    （5）在印度支那各商定的海、陆、空口岸监督停止自印度支那境外运入一切新的武装力量和军事人员及各种武器、弹药和军事技术器材；
    （6）为了保证更有效地执行停战协定，对该协定条款提供可能的修正和补充的建议。
    中立国委员会通过驻在停战协定所规定的各地点的视察小组执行它的职务。
    一般规则：
    六、监察履行停战协定条款的中立国委员会在各委员的适当的同意下作出决定。
    该委员会应将它的决定通知联合委员会；联合委员会据此采取适当的措施，或者交回中立国委员会进行重新审查。如果这种审查得不到结果，中立国委员会应即通知联合委员会和保证国。
    如果在审查某一有关履行停战协定条款的问题时，中立国委员会内发生分歧，则整个委员会或其个别委员应将该调解的问题、包括委员会中各委员国的立场，报告联合委员会和保证国。
    如果联合委员会双方竟无法解决该问题上的分歧，则保证国应即采取适当措施以消除违反协定的事件或这种违反协定事件的威胁。
    七、兹规定，对下列问题须在委员会中无分歧的情况下作出决定。
    甲、与可能引起敌对行动之再起的违反协定条款的事件或产生违反协定的威胁（包括各方武装力量对领土、领海及领空的侵犯）有关的问题；
    乙、有关修正和补充停战协定条款的问题。
    八、对下列问题可经简单多数表决作出决定：
    甲、与本委员会执行其禁止自印度支那境外运入新的武装部队——陆军、空军、海军，各种武器
  （装配成的或拆散的），现成的弹药，以及各种军事技术器材这一职权有关的问题；
    乙、与调查联合委员会或一方指称违反停战协定事件有关的问题；
    丙、中立国委员会职权范围内的其他问题。
    在调解上述各项问题时，一旦票数各占半数，则以主席一票决定。
    九、中立国委员会对停战协定规定的各地点以外的地方的调查，经与有关一方的司令官协议后即可立即进行。
    十、中立国委员会根据本决议制订它的工作细则。
    叁、国际保证
    十一、日内瓦会议与会各国承担对停战协定履行的保证。
    十二、当联合委员会和中立国监察委员会无法采取适当措施，以消除在印度支那违反或威胁停战协定的事件以及因此产生敌对行动之再起的威胁时，参加保证协定的各国应即召开会议进行协商，以采取保证履行协定的集体措施。
    前已报道，在过去两周中，会议一直讨论中国代表团的六项建议中关于成立联合委员会和监察履行停战协定的中立国委员会的问题。讨论的情况表明，与会各国都承认应该成立联合委员会和中立国监察委员会。但是，在关于上述委员会的职权以及中立国委员会应通过什么程序来作决定的问题上，在与会各国之间尚未达成必要的协议。
    据悉，在十四日的会议上，苏联代表团认为，联合委员会应该具有这些职权的必要性，是根据停战协定本身的性质而产生的。遵守协定，这首先是双方的任务。因此，他们应对协定的履行承担主要责任。如果任何一方不去遵守这一协定的各项规定，那么任何一个中立国委员会也不能保证协定的执行。
    关于联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的相互关系问题，苏联代表团指出：苏联代表团仍然主张，这些委员会应以最密切的方式在其工作上互相配合，但不应使一个委员会的工作依赖于另一委员会的行动。否则，可能只会造成关于委员会之间关系的不必要的混乱，并对这些委员会完成其直接任务发生否定的影响。主张一个委员会应隶属于另一个委员会的观点基本上是错误的。这种观点的含义就是联合委员会应按中立国监察委员会的命令行事。在这种情况下，以什么作命令的后盾呢？用武力吗？用军队吗？这就是建议中立国监察委员会应在印度支那有军队，并对讨论中的地区予以占领，这是不符合恢复印度支那和平的宗旨的。
    关于中立国监察委员会的成员问题和在该委员会内部如何采取决定的问题，会议在讨论过程中遇到了最大的困难。苏联代表团指出：必须在决定委员会成员问题时不允许有片面性。不然的话，中立国委员会就不能被看作是考虑双方利益而行动的公正机构。苏联代表团认为，在中立国监察委员会如何作决定的问题上，必须考虑到委员会将审查各种意义的问题。在采取某些决定时，不允许有片面性，特别在那些在极大程度上涉及双方利益的问题上，这一点尤为重要。苏联代表团同意下述可能性，即在某些问题上委员会可以利用多数表决办法采取决定。在这种情况下，规定了委员会主席的特别作用，即在委员会委员的票数平分的情况下，主席的一票具有决定意义。苏联代表团在进一步说明这个问题时认为，在苏联已提出的四个中立国名单中，第一名印度可以充当委员会的主席。
    苏联代表团在提出上述建议时指出，苏联代表团在提出建议时曾考虑到其他会议参加者在讨论监察履行停战协定问题时所作的声明。苏联代表团认为，这一建议将有助于我们在这一重要问题上达成协议，这将首先促成在其他涉及恢复印度支那和平的问题上达成协议。
    据悉，苏联代表团的建议得到了中华人民共和国代表团和越南民主共和国代表团的完全支持。
    中国代表团在今天的会议上指出，在最近几次大会中，某些代表团对于各方意见中的相同点不感兴趣，对于许多差异点却尽量加以扩大，以致很难接近，甚至有意造成一些人为的僵局，为某种企图制造借口。中国代表团表示仍愿继续努力，寻求方法，克服困难，以便能尽快达成协议。
    中国代表团支持苏联代表团的建议，认为这个建议是公平的、合理的、能够解决实际问题的。中国代表团并表示不反对在会外根据苏联代表团的建议就中立国监察委员会的成员问题进行商谈，以求获得解决。
    关于联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的关系问题，中国代表团认为，印度支那停战基本上应该依靠双方的诚意，如果抹煞由双方司令部代表组成的联合委员会的积极作用，就是对交战双方要求停战的诚意表示不信任。应当通过划分两个委员会的职权范围来克服在这两个委员会的关系上的分歧。苏联代表团的建议中已经对两个委员会的职权范围规定得很清楚。联合委员会和中立国监察委员会应该是平行的而不是隶属的机构。中国代表团指出：美国代表团的论据是站不住的，它既然承认交战双方对于停战诚意的必要性，就无法否认联合委员会对停战将起的主要的作用。
    关于一致协议的原则和多数表决的方法问题，中国代表团认为，苏联代表团的建议将一致协议的原则和多数表决的方法加以适当划分和配合，因而提供了一个最能达成协议的基础。本会议应当接受苏联代表团的建议作为讨论的基础，以便就停战的监察和国际保证问题迅速达成协议。
    越南民主共和国代表团在宣布赞成苏联代表团的建议时，着重说明联合委员会和中立国监察委员会的关系应当是平行的，而不是前者隶属于后者。越南民主共和国代表团认为，只有联合委员会才完全具备顺利执行停战协定的必要条件。
    会议上曾有人认为印度支那交战双方打了八年仗，很难有效地执行停战协定。越南民主共和国代表团指出，八年前法越双方签订初步协定和临时协定时，法方还自认为是强者，企图用武力征服越南。但自那时以后，在八年的战争中，许多人已得到了教训。今天在印度支那作战的法国远征军的广大军官和士兵们，希望并要求和平，因为他们了解战争对他们的国家毫无益处；而且他们认为，当和平有机会在光荣的条件下获得时而不去获得就是罪恶。越南民主共和国代表团相信，一旦停战协定缔结，法国远征军的广大军官和士兵是愿意执行的。至于越南民主共和国方面，它一贯要求和平。它将真诚地严格地履行停战协定的所有条款。
    苏联代表团的建议和中华人民共和国及越南民主共和国的代表团的意见，提供了解决过去两周中的分歧并迅速达成协议的途径。只要不是存心破坏会议，没有任何理由不采纳苏联代表团的建议。然而，据已获得的消息说，以美国为首的某些西方国家的代表们，对于达成协议并不感到兴趣。美国代表还没有认真研究苏联代表团的建议，就急忙采取了抹煞一切的态度。美国代表竟把苏联建议中关于中立国监察委员会的表决程序的合理的划分，说成是把问题复杂化。作为会议主席之一的英国代表，并没有表示他将根据苏联代表团的建设性的建议而致力于达成协议，反而怀疑继续讨论是否得策，并且说可以考虑休会一个时期。此间观察家明显地看到，以美国为首的某些西方国家代表团有意制造人为的障碍，阻挠达成任何协议。
    据悉，在十四日的会议上，有些代表提到高棉和寮国的问题。越南民主共和国、中国和苏联的代表团表示不反对在以后的会议上讨论这两个国家的问题，但希望这并不阻挠对目前问题的讨论。
