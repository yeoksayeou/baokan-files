    East China
    Over Two Million Mu of Land Afforested This Spring
    Xinhua News Agency: This spring, mountainous areas and suitable afforestation areas in hills and plains of East China have afforested a total of 2,487,000 mu, completing more than 92% of the annual afforestation plan. In Fujian Province's Min River, Zhejiang Province's Ou River and Qu River, Anhui Province's Xin'an River, and Shandong Province's Yi River and Shu River, large quantities of Chinese fir and eucalyptus trees have been planted for use as construction materials for factories, mines, railways, bridges, and other construction projects when they mature. In addition, various types of water conservation forests, shelter forests, fuel forests, special economic forests, and scenic forests have also been established in various regions. At present, most of the planted saplings are growing well. In Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces, the survival rate of seedlings generally reaches 80% to 90% or more.
    This spring's afforestation in East China witnessed a significant development of forestry mutual aid and cooperative organizations. According to incomplete statistics from some mountainous areas in Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, twenty-six forestry production cooperatives, one hundred and one agricultural-forestry and forestry-animal husbandry production cooperatives focusing on forestry, and two thousand eight hundred and fifty-two agricultural-forestry mutual aid teams were newly established this spring. This spring, Shandong Province afforested more than 377,000 mu of land, of which 80% was planted by farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. According to the needs of national industrial timber, farmers organized in Kaihua and Wencheng counties, Zhejiang Province, planted nearly 30,000 mu of Chinese fir forests, accounting for more than 80% of the total afforestation area of the two counties this spring. In order to green the Foziling Reservoir, the Foziling Forestry, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Anhui Province planted 310 mu of water conservation forests and formulated a three-year afforestation plan. This spring, fifteen agricultural and forestry production cooperatives in Tangkou Township, Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, planted 600,000 Chinese fir trees using the advanced Soviet "dense planting method". At present, many afforestation areas have begun to close the mountains for forest protection and to nurture seedlings.

    华东区各地
    春季造林二百多万亩
    华东各地山区和适宜造林的丘陵、平原地区，今年春季共造林二百四十八万七千多亩，完成全年造林计划百分之九十二以上。福建省的闽江，浙江省的瓯江、衢江，安徽省的新安江和山东省的沂河、沭河等地营造大批杉树、桉树，以备长成后供作建筑工厂、矿山、铁路、桥梁等建设用材。此外，各地还营造有水源林、防护林、薪炭林、特种经济林和风景林等。目前各地栽植的幼树，大部分生长良好。福建、浙江、江苏等省幼苗的成活率一般达百分之八十到九十以上。
    今年华东区春季造林中，林业互助合作组织有显著发展。据山东、安徽、江苏等三省部分山区的不完全统计，今春新建了二十六个林业生产合作社、一百零一个以林业为主的农林、林牧生产合作社和二千八百五十二个农林互助组。山东省今春造林三十七万七千多亩，其中百分之八十是参加互助合作组织的农民栽植的。浙江省开化、文成两县组织起来的农民根据国家工业用材的需要，栽植了近三万亩杉木林，占两县今春造林总面积的百分之八十以上。安徽省佛子岭林农牧生产合作社为了绿化佛子岭水库，造了三百一十亩水源林，并订出了造林的三年计划。浙江省开化县塘口乡十五个农林生产合作社，今春采用苏联先进的“密植法”栽植了六十万株杉树。目前很多造林地区已开始封山护林和抚育幼苗。（新华社）
