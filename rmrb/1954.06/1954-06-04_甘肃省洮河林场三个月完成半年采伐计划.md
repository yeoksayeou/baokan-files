Taohe Forest Farm of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, with thorough preparation before production and attention to safety, completed 50% of this year's timber harvesting plan in the first quarter.

This year, in terms of timber harvesting, the Taohe Forest Farm formulated an operational plan based on the targets issued by higher authorities. After discussion among all employees, the shortcomings of on-site operations were corrected, and the policy of combining harvesting and cultivation was implemented. The direction of felling was controlled to avoid damaging young trees. Sawing was implemented to reduce the height of stumps, save timber, and increase its utilization value. As a result, 50% of the annual timber harvesting plan was completed in the first quarter.

More than 700 water transport workers of Han, Hui, Dongxiang, and Tibetan ethnicities in the Taohe Transport Team are transporting timber on the 500-kilometer-long waterways of the Taohe and Yellow Rivers. The first batch of timber arrived in Lanzhou on May 16th. It is expected that 45,000 cubic meters of timber will be successively transported by the end of September this year to meet the needs of national construction.

Before the start of timber transportation, the employees of the Taohe Transport Team had already blasted more than 4,600 cubic meters of dangerous reefs in narrow gorges, and built more than 11,000 meters of walkways on cliffs and steep slopes in the gorges. They also formulated new delivery quotas based on the annual delivery tasks, providing favorable conditions for the smooth transportation of timber this year.

    甘肃省洮河林场三个月完成半年采伐计划
    甘肃省人民政府农林厅洮河林场，在生产前准备充分，注意安全生产，第一季度已完成了今年采伐计划的百分之五十。
    洮河林场今年在采伐方面，根据上级颁发的指标，编定了作业计划，经过全体职工的讨论，纠正了现场作业的缺点，贯彻采育结合的方针，控制倒向，避免打伤幼树，实行锯伐，降低伐根，节约木材，增加利用价值。因此在第一季度，即完成了全年采伐计划的百分之五十。
    洮河运输队的七百多名汉、回、东乡、藏族等水上运输工人，正在洮河、黄河长达五百多公里的水路上运输木材，第一批木材已于五月十六日运抵兰州。预计到今年九月底，将陆续运完四万五千立方公尺的木材，供应国家建设需要。
    洮河运输队的职工在木材运输开始以前，就已炸除峡道险要礁石四千六百多立方公尺，从峡道悬崖陡坡上修筑了一万一千多公尺长的走道，又根据全年放运任务，制订了新的放运定额，为今年顺利运送木材提供了有利条件。
