Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, June 24th: Jakarta newspapers on the 23rd prominently featured the arrival of the Chinese trade delegation in Jakarta and the remarks made by the delegation leader, Kong Yuan, on their front pages. Many newspapers published photographs of the members of the Chinese trade delegation and issued editorials expressing their welcome.

    The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported that Indonesian business circles hoped that the Sino-Indonesian trade agreement signed in 1953 would be implemented as soon as possible. These business figures said that Indonesia suffered greatly when it still relied on the so-called "dollar area" market. The "People's Daily" stated that conducting trade with the People's Republic of China is one of the ways out of Indonesia's economic difficulties.

    The "Eastern Star" quoted an international trade observer as saying that he hoped that the negotiations between China and Indonesia on trade issues would proceed smoothly.

    The "Indonesia Torch" stated that China has a large demand for raw materials such as tin and rubber, and China will be one of the main buyers of Indonesian products.

    The "Social Messenger" stated that the implementation of the Sino-Indonesian trade agreement is beneficial to both China and Indonesia.
