    The Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing and Wuxi purchasing and supply stations of China National Department Store Company and other units have dispatched visiting supply groups, carrying samples, to various provinces for circuit exhibitions and visits to understand consumers' needs.
    The visiting supply group organized by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store Company, carrying department store production samples produced in Shanghai, visited more than 30 representative key cities and counties in six provinces including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan, and Henan, as well as grassroots department stores and cooperatives in the Shanghai area, to investigate the sales of Shanghai department store products in various regions, as well as the production and sales of local industrial products, and widely solicit opinions in order to guide production. The visiting group from the station to Jiangsu Province held an industrial product exhibition and farmer symposium in Dongtai Department Store, listening to farmers' opinions and requirements on department store supply. According to the opinions of the visiting groups sent to the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Northwest, and Hebei and Shanxi, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store Company has changed the specifications and styles of 42 kinds of processed products. The Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store Company organized a commodity circuit exhibition visiting group, carrying more than 1,000 kinds of samples to exhibition visits in 14 key areas such as Hechuan and Nanchong, gaining a further understanding of farmers' purchasing power. For example, farmers in Hechuan used to buy towels and socks worth 3,000 yuan, but now they want to buy about 5,000 yuan worth; many farmers also want to buy wool yarn costing 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per pound. At the same time, they put forward many constructive suggestions on the commodities supplied by state-owned department stores. Through the exhibition visit, according to the opinions of cooperatives and farmers, Hechuan State-owned Department Store added 80 kinds of commodities that had never been operated before to the goods plan. Nanchong State-owned Department Store supplemented 123 kinds of commodities.
    At present, the Tianjin and Shanghai purchasing and supply stations of China National Department Store Company and other units are actively improving the specifications, styles, and quality of incoming goods based on the opinions from various regions. (Wang Shutian)

    分赴各省巡回访问了解消费者的需要
    中国百货公司上海、天津、重庆及无锡采购供应站等单位派出访问供应组，携带样品，分赴各省巡回展览访问，了解消费者的需要。
    中国百货公司上海采购供应站组织的访问供应组，携带上海生产的百货生产样品，分别到浙江、江苏、安徽、山东、湖南、河南六省的三十多个有代表性的重点市、县和上海市地区的基层百货商店、合作社进行访问，调查上海百货产品在各地销售情况，以及当地工业品的产销情况，广泛地征求意见，以便指导生产。该站去江苏省的访问组，在东台百货商店举行工业品展览和农民座谈会，听取了农民对百货供应上的意见和要求。中国百货公司天津采购供应站根据派往东北、内蒙古、西北及河北、山西的访问组访问的意见，已改变了四十二种商品加工生产的规格式样。中国百货公司重庆采购供应站组织商品巡回展览访问组，携带了一千多种样品到合川、南充等十四个重点地区展览访问，对农民购买力有了进一步了解。如合川农民过去多买三千元的毛巾、袜子，现在要买五千元左右的了；十二、三万元一磅的毛线也有很多农民要买。同时对国营百货商店供应的商品提了不少建设性的意见。通过展览访问，合川国营百货商店根据合作社和农民的意见，要货计划中增添了八十种从未经营过的商品。南充国营百货商店补充商品一百二十三种。
    目前，中国百货公司天津、上海采购供应站等单位，正根据各地访问意见，积极改进进货的规格式样和质量。　（王书田）
