    This year, the number of high school graduates cannot meet the needs of university enrollment. It is necessary to select and send a number of young cadres in service to apply for universities. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has given clear instructions in its "Decision on Ensuring the Completion of the 1954 National University Enrollment Plan" on May 20. This is not only necessary for improving the skills of young cadres in service, but also an important measure to ensure the quantity and quality of future cadres and to realize the national construction plan. Many departments, in accordance with the spirit of this decision of the Party Central Committee, have proceeded from the overall interests of the country, overcome temporary difficulties, and actively carried out the selection and sending work. However, there are also some department leaders who have not only failed to do so, but have instead emphasized difficulties and adopted various incorrect attitudes towards young cadres who meet the application requirements and request to apply. Some require young cadres who want to apply to resign first before applying; some pass the buck up and down, delaying answering cadres' application requests; some superficially agree to the application, but do not give time to prepare for the exam; some even use words like "It would be embarrassing to return to the office if you fail the exam" to discourage the enthusiasm of young people in service to apply. These are all completely wrong.
    Of course, for general work departments, drawing out some outstanding young cadres will have some impact on the current work, but as long as we are good at exploring the potential within each department, the difficulties can be overcome. This requires the responsible persons of each department not only to see the immediate needs of their own departments, but also to be good at taking care of the overall and long-term interests of national construction. If this year's university enrollment plan cannot be completed, and the quantity and quality of new students cannot be guaranteed, it will affect the entire country's cadre training plan. Of course, there are also a small number of young cadres in certain positions who cannot apply for universities this year due to work needs, and they should obey the urgent needs of the current work and not force themselves to apply.
    We request that all relevant departments conscientiously implement the spirit of the Central Committee's decision, seize the time, and earnestly carry out the work of selecting and sending young cadres to apply for universities. Not only must the departments assigned enrollment quotas complete their tasks, but even departments that have not been assigned enrollment quotas should actively select and send young cadres who meet the selection conditions. Only in this way can this year's university enrollment plan be completed on schedule, and the quality of new students can be appropriately improved.

### 必须积极地选送在职青年干部报考高等学校

    必须积极地选送在职青年干部报考高等学校
    今年高中毕业生不能满足高等学校招生的需要，必须选送一部分在职青年干部投考高等学校，中共中央在五月二十日“关于保证完成一九五四年全国高等学校招生计划的决定”中已有明确指示。这不仅是提高在职青年干部所必需，也是保证未来干部的数量和质量、实现国家建设计划的重要措施之一。许多部门都已根据党中央这一决定的精神，从国家整体利益着眼，克服一时困难，积极进行选送工作。但也还有些部门的领导人员，不仅没有这样做，反而强调困难，对于适合报考条件、要求报考的青年干部，采取了种种不正确的态度。有的要要求报考的青年干部先辞职，再报考；有的上下推诿，对干部的报考要求，延不作答；有的表面上同意报考，但不给准备考试的时间；有的甚至用“考不上再回机关多丢人”一类的话来打击在职青年报考的积极性。这些都是完全错误的。
    当然，对一般工作部门来说，抽出一些优秀青年干部，眼前工作是会受到一些影响的，但只要善于发掘各部门内部的潜力，困难是能够克服的。这就要各部门的负责人不要只看到本部门的眼前需要，而应善于照顾国家建设的整体利益和长远利益。如果今年高等学校的招生计划不能完成，新生的数量和质量得不到保证，那就要影响整个国家的干部培养计划。当然，也有少数工作岗位上的青年干部，因工作需要，今年是不可能报考高等学校的，这就应该服从当前工作的迫切需要，不要强求报考。
    我们要求各有关部门，都能切实根据中央决定的精神，抓紧时间，认真进行选送青年干部报考高等学校工作。不仅分配到选送名额的部门必须完成任务，就是没有分配到选送名额的部门，如有具备选送条件的青年干部，也应主动积极地选送。只有这样，今年高等学校的招生计划才能按期完成，新生质量才能适当提高。
