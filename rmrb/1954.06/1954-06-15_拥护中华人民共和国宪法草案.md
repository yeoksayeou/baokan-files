Huang Yanpei's Speech

The People's Republic of China is approaching its fifth anniversary. Under the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in the past four years and more, in various aspects of political power construction, economic construction, cultural construction, and military construction, a good and solid foundation has been laid victoriously in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This draft constitution is based on these foundations, and at the same time, it is their development, as has been made clear in the preamble to the draft constitution. I have been holding some responsibilities in the Central People's Government and among the democratic parties. Regarding this draft constitution, during the drafting process unfolded by the Constitution Drafting Committee, from March 23 to June 11, 1954, I had the opportunity to participate in all these meetings, and I had the opportunity to understand the "profound meaning in simple words" of this draft constitution in general.

I would like to first state that this draft constitution will soon be submitted to the National People's Congress. After its formal promulgation, this constitution will be the first people's constitution in China's history, and the only constitution to lead the Chinese people onto the socialist road. It belongs to the socialist type, the same as the constitutions of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. For the broad masses of the people, this completely conforms to their actual situation and demands. Moreover, after the draft constitution is published, discussions will be organized among the people throughout the country, and after extensive and in-depth, extremely cautious procedures, this constitution will ultimately and truly become the people's constitution, and the constitution upon which the people throughout the country rely to embark on the socialist road.

It is necessary to recognize certain basic points, which have already been written in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Some points have been further written into this draft constitution.

In the first chapter, General Principles, among the twenty articles, two should be given special attention: Article 4, " The People's Republic of China, relying on state organs and social forces, shall, through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, ensure the gradual elimination of the system of exploitation and the building of a socialist society”; Article 15, "The state guides the development and transformation of the national economy through economic planning, so as to continuously improve the productive forces, improve the material and cultural life of the people, and consolidate national independence and security.” From these articles, the clear goal and path of leading the new China onto the socialist road can be seen.

The draft constitution, based on the current situation, writes out four forms of ownership of the means of production. Among them, for individual farmers and individual handicraft workers, in Articles 7, 8, and 9, it indicates the direction and methods of transformation. For capitalist industry and commerce, especially in Article 10, it specifically writes out the "policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation," requiring gradual replacement of capitalist ownership with ownership by the whole people. On the one hand, it prohibits its illegal activities, and on the other hand, it provides the same protection of property ownership according to law as farmers and handicraft workers. We have not found such provisions in the constitutions of general countries, which shows that these are specifically combined with China's actual situation. The policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved some successes after several years of implementation. After the constitution is promulgated, efforts will be made to promote it until the ultimate goal is realized step by step. I firmly believe that these provisions will provide a good model for countries that voluntarily embark on the socialist road and have the same situation in the future.

We call this constitution the people's constitution, and there are main reasons for this. Where does the power of the state come from? It comes from the people of the whole country. Where is it embodied? It is embodied in the National People's Congress. "The National People's Congress is the highest organ of state power" (Article 21), "and is the sole organ exercising the legislative power of the state" (Article 22). The passage of this constitution is due to it, and the power to amend it in the future belongs to it (Article 27, paragraph 1). Even the Chairman of the People's Republic of China can be removed by it (Article 28, paragraph 1), and the deputies to the National People's Congress can only be replaced by the original electoral units in accordance with the law (Article 38), which can be said to fully promote democracy. However, judging from the various provisions in the entire chapter on the state structure, the lower level obeys the higher level, the minority obeys the majority, and the local obeys the central government, which can be said to fully and correctly embody democratic centralism.

The armed forces of the state also belong to the people. In Article 20, its mission is also defined as "defending the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and safeguarding the security of the country and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty." It is clearly and fully written that it is a force for defending peace. This is tantamount to giving a powerful answer to the imperialists' rumors.

Since the founding of the new China, the policy of national unity has been implemented particularly correctly and powerfully, and some achievements have already been made. This draft constitution, regarding the basic provisions of the system of national autonomy, in Section 5 of Chapter 2, very kindly and fully takes into account the characteristics of minority nationalities. Article 67 clearly states: "The form of autonomous organs may be stipulated according to the wishes of the majority of the people of the nationality implementing regional autonomy."

This draft constitution gives special encouragement to scientific research and literary and artistic creation (Article 95). What is more noteworthy is the special care for the physical and intellectual development of young people (Article 94, paragraph 2), and the protection of women, marriage, family, mothers, and children (Article 96). This not only guarantees the soundness of the nation's future but also leads the people of the whole country to take a step forward ideologically.

I dare say that this draft constitution fully demonstrates its constructiveness, peacefulness, unity, and progressiveness.

I only want to raise two more points that I believe cannot be ignored during implementation.

First, the procedures through which this draft constitution was formed have been made clear earlier. After the Central People's Government Committee promulgates this draft constitution, it also requires "organizing discussions among the people throughout the country." Then, all parties and aspects, including all democratic parties, must call on everyone to offer opinions on this draft constitution as much as possible, even if there are inevitable discrepancies in policies or facts. Let the central government consider and adopt them. In the position of the people, we must learn and study at the same time, knowing everything and saying everything. Only in this way can we be worthy of the great Chairman Mao's humble inquiries and earnest expectations of the people throughout the country. Only in this way can it become a truly people's constitution.

Second, the preamble to the draft constitution has pointed out: "In the great struggle to establish the People's Republic of China, our people have formed a broad people's democratic united front of all democratic classes, democratic parties, and people's organizations, led by the Chinese Communist Party. In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the state during the transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, our people's democratic united front will continue to play its role." This is completely correct. Over the past few years, we have deeply recognized the superiority of our country's people's democratic system and the significant role played by the people's democratic united front in various aspects. As a democratic party—the China Democratic National Construction Association—we will make greater efforts in the future to organize all members, together with private industrialists and businessmen, to unite around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, faithfully accept leadership, and strive to consolidate the people's democratic system and build a prosperous and happy socialist society.

I propose that this draft constitution of the People's Republic of China be approved and promulgated by the Central People's Government Committee.

Zhang Nanxian's Speech

I am very excited and very satisfied after reading this draft constitution. This draft constitution is completely based on the truth of the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and completely conforms to the wishes of our people. It eradicates the patriarchal politics and bureaucratic politics of our country for thousands of years, and smashes the old legal shackles of the people for thousands of years, so that the people can all be guaranteed freedom and equality under the law. If it were not for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, such a constitution would be unimaginable. I endorse this draft constitution with twelve thousand points of enthusiasm.

Ma Xulun's Speech

Please allow me to express my complete agreement and support for the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China proposed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and discussed many times by the Constitution Drafting Committee with infinite excitement and gratitude.

This draft constitution, which our people throughout the country have longed for for many years and shed blood to fight for, has finally been produced. I really cannot fully express my heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to the Party and Chairman Mao in words!

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China writes down the experience and summary of the social changes since the people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China, fixes the achievements of the people's revolution, fully embodies the fundamental requirement of our country's gradual transition to socialism, and points out the possibilities and correct paths for our people to strive to achieve this requirement. This is the fundamental law guiding the future life, work, and struggle of our people throughout the country.

The draft constitution fully reflects the characteristics of our country's transition period, especially the comparison of class forces during the transition period. The draft constitution stipulates that the state protects the existing various ownership systems, and at the same time, it stipulates the leading position of the state-owned economy of ownership by the whole people in the entire national economy and its priority development, and stipulates that the capitalist ownership will be gradually replaced by the socialist ownership by the whole people, and the ownership of individual laborers will be gradually changed into the socialist collective ownership.

The draft constitution stipulates the national political system of true people's democracy, which in essence belongs to the advanced type of socialism, the same as the constitutions of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

The various provisions in the draft constitution on guaranteeing the equality of all nationalities in the country are a brilliant embodiment of the Marxist-Leninist theory of nationality combined with China's actual situation. This is unimaginable in capitalist countries that practice national oppression.

The chapter on the basic rights and obligations of citizens in the draft constitution writes down guarantees for the interests of the people as much as practically possible, and stipulates measures to gradually expand material guarantees, which forms such a strong contrast with the provisions of the constitutions of capitalist countries that only seek benefits for a few people.

This is a document of historical significance. It records the existing achievements of the Chinese people's revolution in simple and clear words, and also points out the correct direction for the Chinese people to continue to work hard under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the lighthouse that illuminates the life and work of our people throughout the country and the banner of our struggle. There is no doubt that the promulgation of the draft constitution will surely arouse unparalleled joy and jubilation among the people throughout the country, spiritually arm the people throughout the country, inspire the people throughout the country to move forward, and strive for the complete realization of a beautiful socialist society!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Ulanhu's Speech

I fully agree with and support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I suggest that the Central People's Government Committee approve and promulgate it.

The draft constitution of the People's Republic of China is a victorious summary of the great achievements of the long-term heroic revolutionary struggle of the people of all nationalities in China; it is a fundamental guarantee that our country can build a prosperous and happy socialist society through peaceful means. It fully reflects and expresses the common aspirations of the people of all nationalities throughout the country, which they have dreamed of for a hundred years, and which have been realized and will be realized.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government have guaranteed the rights of all minority nationalities in the country in terms of politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and have implemented the policy of regional autonomy. Now, all of them are clearly fixed in the draft constitution, which enables all minority nationalities in the country to develop their political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings along with the progress of the motherland's construction, and have a fundamental guarantee for raising from backward nationalities to advanced nationalities. Therefore, the draft constitution will surely be enthusiastically supported by the people of all minority nationalities throughout the country, and the people of all minority nationalities throughout the country will surely be as enthusiastically excited and encouraged as the Han people, further enhance their spirit of loving the motherland, and more sincerely love and support the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, thereby greatly strengthening the unity of the people of all nationalities in the motherland, and actively and jointly strive to build a happy and prosperous socialist society.

He Xiangning's Speech

I felt very excited just now after listening to the report of the Constitution Drafting Committee. I fully endorse the spirit, content, and articles of the draft constitution, word for word. And I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere and lofty respect to our great leader Chairman Mao, who personally led the drafting of the constitution.

This constitution is the first constitution of our People's Republic of China, and I feel deeply honored to have the opportunity to participate in the drafting of this constitution. Everyone has expressed many opinions on the content of the draft constitution, and I myself have also expressed many opinions. Now I will add a little bit of feelings:

First of all, the current international situation is complicated and complex, and American imperialism has always been engaged in conspiracy activities. In order to ensure our domestic peaceful construction and to maintain peace in the Far East and the world, we need strong central leadership. Therefore, I think it is very necessary for Chairman Mao to personally lead the Supreme State Conference and the National Defense Commission. In this way, we can quickly and timely deal with state affairs. I also hope that Chairman Mao can lead us to victoriously complete the three five-year plans, build socialism, and achieve a position of freedom, equality, prosperity, and strength.

Secondly, when discussing the preamble to the constitution, I originally advocated adding a section on the revolutionary history of the past hundred years. Because the preamble should not be too long and not conform to the style, I gave up this opinion. Because I once followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to participate in the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Sun made certain contributions to overthrowing the feudal autocratic rule of the Qing Dynasty. I think this period of history has the value of being preserved. I personally feel that there is a responsibility to record the historical facts of the revolutionary martyrs. Therefore, I hope that when compiling history textbooks, we can write more about the revolutionary facts in this regard.

Finally, I hope that the people of the whole country, with one heart and one mind, will support this draft constitution, strive to publicize and explain it, and launch extensive and enthusiastic study and discussion.

Chen Shutong's Speech

Today, the Constitution Drafting Committee presented this draft constitution of the People's Republic of China to the Central People's Government Committee. When the people of our country read this draft, they should first feel that our constitution was made with the blood of countless martyrs. The preamble also mentions the struggle of more than a hundred years, and I think especially the arduous struggle of the Communist Party in the past thirty years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, liberated China and established a people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants. It was only after a series of political and economic victories in the past four years that this constitution could be formulated. Therefore, when the people of the whole country see this constitution, they should always remember the immortal martyrs.

Regarding the constitution:

1.  Our constitution is a socialist type of constitution, which is based on the interests of all the people, and is different from the capitalist constitution, which is based on the interests of a few people.
2.  Our constitution is to fix the experience of more than four years, or it can be said that it is the achievement of more than four years, in the form of legal provisions, because this achievement is worth cherishing.
3.  Our constitution is the constitution of the transition period, so we cannot be the same as the constitution of the Soviet Union, which has already built a socialist society, but is a constitution that is moving towards a socialist society, but the essence is completely the same as the Soviet constitution.
4.  Our constitution has a programmatic nature, which is what the preamble says, based on the Common Program, and it is also the development of the Common Program; that is, to fix the achievements that have been made, and at the same time reflect the common aspirations of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society, which can also be said to be the general task of the transition period.
5.  There is not a single empty word in our constitution. What should be done is what should be written on it, but what should be done but can only be done to a certain extent now is written on it to a certain extent; for example, the substitution of ownership by the whole people for capitalist ownership is inevitable; but now it is still impossible not to recognize capitalist ownership, so the constitution stipulates both the protection of capitalist ownership and points out that it will be gradually replaced by ownership by the whole people through utilization, restriction, and transformation; for example, the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to education are all should be stipulated, but now they can only be done to a certain extent, and they are also written on it.
6.  After the draft constitution is promulgated, it will undoubtedly attract the attention of the people all over the world. The people all over the world will realize from this draft constitution that the Chinese people are engaging in peaceful domestic construction with great strength under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so this will have a significant impact on the cause of world peace.

In short, our constitution conforms to the wishes of the broad masses of the people. The constitution is the constitution of the Chinese people themselves. The content of the constitution belongs to the socialist type of constitution, and it is also a constitution that embodies the general task of the transition period, and it is also a constitution for peaceful construction. Finally, I express that I absolutely support this constitution.

Saifuding's Speech

The emergence of the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China is the only new historical event in the lives of our people. This draft guarantees by law that our people will fight to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship based on the leadership of the working class and the alliance of workers and peasants and to jointly build a new socialist China.

The draft constitution especially takes care of and attaches importance to the various minority nationalities within the People's Republic of China. The draft clearly stipulates that the various minority nationalities, like the great Han people, have their freedom and equal rights guaranteed, and the great possibilities for development in political, economic and cultural aspects are also guaranteed. This, on the one hand, fixes the actual experience of the correct ethnic policy that has been implemented for more than four years and is strongly supported by the various minority nationalities - the ethnic policy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; on the other hand, the various minority nationalities are closely united in the great family of the People's Republic of China. , and the desire to work together with the great Han people to build a great socialist China is also fixed in the constitution.

The various minority nationalities, who have suffered serious devastation in all aspects in the past hundreds of years, must feel extremely excited that their future happy life can be guaranteed by this kind of law.

Our draft constitution is a correct people's constitution that effectively guarantees all the wishes and requirements of the people throughout the country.

Therefore, I fully agree with and support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, and I suggest that the Central People's Government Committee pass and promulgate it.

Cheng Qian's Speech

I fully support the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China. The first draft of this constitution was proposed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Constitution Drafting Committee. This draft constitution was drafted under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao. The Constitution Drafting Committee and the National Committee of the CPPCC, major regions, provinces, and cities have discussed the draft constitution article by article and repeatedly, and put forward some amendments. The Constitution Drafting Committee studied these opinions separately and appropriately adopted them, and made meticulous and detailed revisions to the draft constitution before forming this draft constitution. During more than two months of study and participation in discussions, I was able to have the opportunity to study the spirit and essence of the draft constitution in a relatively in-depth manner, and at the same time study the constitutions of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, so I gained a basic understanding of the draft constitution. I think: Our draft constitution is based on the general scientific principles of Marxist-Leninist constitutional theory, combined with China's historical development status and national conditions. This draft constitution is the brilliant crystallization and brilliant creation of Mao Zedong Thought. This draft constitution summarizes the struggle experience and organizational experience of our people against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism for more than a hundred years, especially in the past thirty years, and records the great achievements of the victory of the people's revolution. This draft constitution illustrates the multi-component nature of the economic structure and the leading position of the socialist economy in our country during the transition period, clearly stipulates the basic principles for the development of socialist economic components and the transformation of non-socialist economic components, profoundly reflects the essence of the general line and general task during the transition period, and definitely points out the direction of the country's advance towards socialism. This draft constitution systematically summarizes the political system that our people have gradually created and developed in the revolutionary struggle, and stipulates the state organs of the people's democratic state. This draft constitution also fixes the basic rights and obligations of citizens in the form of legal provisions. Therefore, this draft constitution embodies the highest and long-term interests of our people, and it has unparalleled superiority. The root cause of this superiority lies in our country's people's democratic system.

In his report "On the Draft Constitution of the Soviet Union," Stalin once pointed out several basic characteristics of the Soviet constitution and explained the principled differences between the Soviet constitution and the bourgeois constitution. Our country is now in the historical stage of transitioning to socialism, and of course there are many differences from the situation when the Stalin constitution was passed in 1936 when socialism had already been victoriously built. However, if we observe from the essence, our draft constitution and the Stalin constitution are the same in their basic characteristics. This is mainly reflected in: First, the draft constitution is not fabricated out of thin air, but is based on facts, and uses legislative procedures to fix what our people have achieved and won; second, the draft constitution reflects the economic structure of the country during the transition period, and points out the leading position of the socialist economy, and expounds the internal and external conditions that non-socialist economic components undergo transformation to gradually achieve socialist ownership and the path that should be followed; third, the draft constitution correctly reflects the actual situation of our country's class relations and the comparison of class forces. In the first article of the draft constitution, the class components of the people's democratic state are explained, and at the same time, it is stated that the leadership of the country belongs to the working class; fourth, the draft constitution has a profound internationalist nature, and its starting point is the complete equality of all races and nationalities. Chairman Mao's brilliant thinking on solving domestic ethnic issues is concentratedly reflected in the preamble to the draft constitution and Article 3 of the general program in Chapter 1 and some articles in Section 4 of Chapter 2 and all the articles in Section 5, which provides a powerful guarantee for solving the most complex ethnic problems in history; fifth, the draft constitution makes appropriate provisions on the basic rights and obligations of citizens according to the current situation and trends of national development. The stipulations of these rights are not empty words, but will be guaranteed and gradually realized with the development and progress of the country in all aspects, especially the development and progress of economic undertakings. This shows that our draft constitution follows the principles of socialist democracy, which is completely different from the hypocritical, multi-restricted, formal, and pseudo-democratic so-called constitutions of capitalist countries. It is precisely because the draft constitution has the above-mentioned basic characteristics and embodies the most progressive idea of the contemporary era—that is, the idea of carrying out socialist transformation of mankind—that our draft constitution and the Stalin constitution, the constitutions of various European people's democratic countries, all belong to the same highest historical type of constitution—the socialist type.

Our draft constitution is "based on the Common Program and is also a development of the Common Program." Obviously, it itself has profound practical significance. Since we have been able to victoriously complete the tasks planned by the "Common Program" in nearly five years, then we have every reason to firmly believe that the socialist prospects of our country revealed in the constitution and the struggle to be carried out to achieve this prospect can also be victoriously realized. At the same time, the passage of the constitution will play a very important role in ensuring the realization of the general line. Because the "Common Program" and the constitution both represent the ideals and aspirations of our people in different historical stages, and represent the demands and interests of our people, so it can be sincerely supported by the people and is willing to strive for its complete and thorough realization.

### 拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案

专栏：

    拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案
    黄炎培的发言
    中华人民共和国成立快到五年了。在中国共产党、毛主席英明的正确的领导之下，四年多以来，关于政权建设、经济建设、文化建设、军事建设种种方面，都根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的规定，胜利地打下了良好而坚实的基础。这部宪法草案，依据这些基础，同时又是它的发展，在宪法草案序言上已经说清楚了。我是一直在中央人民政府，在民主党派中间负一部分任务的，对这部宪法草案，在宪法起草委员会展开起草工作过程中间，从一九五四年三月二十三日至六月十一日，所有这些会议我都获得机会参加，这部宪法草案，它的“微言大义”，我在大体上都获得机会领会到。
    我愿首先说明：这部宪法草案不久将向全国人民代表大会提出，经过正式公布以后，这部宪法，将是中国自有历史以来第一部人民的宪法，也是唯一的领导中国人民走上社会主义大道的宪法，和苏联以及各人民民主国家的宪法是同属于社会主义的类型的。对广大的人民群众说来，这是完全符合他们的实际情况和要求的。而且在宪法草案公布以后，还要在全国人民中组织讨论，经过广泛而深入的极度慎重的手续，最后将使这部宪法切切实实地成为人民的宪法，成为全国人民依据了它走上社会主义大道的宪法。
    必须认识若干基本要点，已经写在人民政协共同纲领上边的了。有若干点进一步写上了这部宪法草案。
    第一章总纲共二十条中间，有两条应该特别注意：就是第四条“中华人民共和国依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会”；第十五条“国家用经济计划指导国民经济的发展和改造，使生产力不断提高，以改进人民的物质生活和文化生活，巩固国家的独立和安全”。从这些条文中间，可以看出领导新中国走上社会主义大道的明确目标和途径。
    宪法草案根据现在情况，写出四种生产资料所有制，其中对于个体农民、个体手工业者在第七、第八、第九各条中间，指示了方向和改造的方法，而对资本主义工商业，特别在第十条具体地写出“采取利用、限制和改造的政策”，要求逐步做到把全民所有制来代替资本家所有制，一方面禁止它的非法行为，另一方面和农民、手工业者同样地予以依照法律对它财产所有权的保护。我们读一般国家宪法，没有发现到这样的规定，可见这些是特别结合着我们中国的实际情况的。对资本主义工商业利用、限制和改造的政策，经过这几年的实施，已经获得些成就了，宪法公布以后，定将努力推行，直到一步一步胜利地实现最终目的为止。我对这些规定，深信将对今后志愿走上社会主义大道而有同样情况的国家，予以良好的楷模。
    我们称这部宪法，为人民的宪法，是有主要理由的。国家权力从那里产生的呢？是全国人民。从那里体现出来的呢？是全国人民代表大会。“全国人民代表大会是最高国家权力机关”（第二十一条），“是行使国家立法权的唯一机关”（第二十二条）。这部宪法的通过由于它，以后修改权就属于它（第二十七条第一款），虽中华人民共和国的主席，它也有权罢免（第二十八条第一款），而全国人民代表大会的代表，只有原选举单位可以按照法律来撤换（第三十八条），可以说充分发扬民主的了。但从整个的国家机构一章里种种规定看来，下级服从上级，少数服从多数，地方服从中央，可以说完全正确地体现了民主集中制。
    国家的武装力量也是属于人民的。在第二十条中间还把它的任务规定为“保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的安全和领土主权的完整”。明白地、充分地写出它是保卫和平的力量。这不啻对帝国主义者的造谣，予以有力的答复。
    新中国成立以来，对民族团结政策，执行得特别正确而有力，也已经获得了一些成就。这部宪法草案，关于民族自治制度的基本规定，在第二章第五节中间很亲切地充分照顾了少数民族的特点，第六十七条明确地写着：“自治机关的形式可以按照实行区域自治的民族大多数人民的意愿规定”。
    这部宪法草案，对科学研究和文学艺术创作特别予以鼓励（第九十五条）。更值得注意的，是对于青年体力和智力发展的特别关怀（第九十四条第二款），对妇女、婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的保护
  （第九十六条），这样不但保证了民族前途的健全，且将导使全国人民在思想上提高一步。
    我敢说：这部宪法草案充分表现了它的建设性、和平性、团结性和进步性。
    我只愿再提出两点，认为是施行时不可以忽视的。
    第一、成立这部宪法草案的经过手续，前边已经说清楚了。中央人民政府委员会公布这部宪法草案以后，还要求“在全国人民中组织讨论”，那么各方各面包括各民主党派都必须号召大家对这部宪法草案尽量提出意见，尽管说出来对于政策，对于事实，或者不免有所出入，尽让中央斟酌取舍，在人民地位必须一面学习、一面研究，知无不言，言无不尽，对这部宪法草案，只有这样，才符合伟大的毛主席对全国人民虚怀的下问和殷切的期望，只有这样，才成为真正的人民的宪法。
    第二、宪法草案序言已经指出：“我国人民在建立中华人民共和国的伟大斗争中已经结成以中国共产党为领导的各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体的广泛的人民民主统一战线。今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”这是完全正确的。几年来我们都深切地认识到我国人民民主制度的优越性和人民民主统一战线在各个方面所发生的重大作用。作为一个民主党派——中国民主建国会，我们今后要以更大的努力组织全体会员，和私营工商业者一道，团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，忠诚地接受领导，为巩固人民民主制度，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。
    我主张这部中华人民共和国宪法草案由中央人民政府委员会予以批准公布。
    张难先的发言
    我看了这个宪法草案，十分的兴奋，十分的满意。这部宪法草案是完全根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林学说的真理，并完全符合于我国人民的愿望而制定的。它把我国几千年的宗法政治、官僚政治铲除得干干净净，把人民几千年的旧法律锁镣粉碎得干干净净，使人民都得到自由平等的法律保障。这种宪法如果不是中国共产党和毛主席的领导，是梦想不到的。我用十二万分的热情，拥护这部宪法草案。
    马叙伦的发言
    请允许我以无限兴奋和感激的心情，对于中国共产党中央委员会所提出的、经过宪法起草委员会多次讨论的中华人民共和国宪法草案，表示完全赞同和拥护。
    这个为我们全国人民多少年来渴望着的、并为之而流血奋斗的宪法草案，现在终于产生了。我实在难以用言语来完全表达出我对于党和毛主席的衷心感激和最崇高的敬意！
    中华人民共和国宪法草案写下了我国人民革命和中华人民共和国成立以来的社会变革的经验总结，固定了人民革命的成果，充分体现了我国逐步过渡到社会主义这一根本的要求，并指出了我国人民为着实现这个要求而奋斗的可能和正确的道路。这是指导我们全国人民今后生活、工作和斗争的根本法。
    宪法草案充分反映了我们国家过渡时期的特点，特别是过渡时期阶级力量的对比。宪法草案既规定了国家分别保护现在的各种所有制，同时又规定了全民所有制的国营经济在整个国民经济中的领导地位和它的优先发展，规定了逐步用社会主义的全民所有制代替资本主义的所有制，逐步改变个体劳动者的所有制为社会主义的集体所有制。
    宪法草案规定了真正人民民主的国家政治制度，实质上是和苏联以及各人民民主国家宪法同属于社会主义的先进类型。
    宪法草案中关于保证国内各民族平等的各项规定，是马克思列宁主义的民族理论与中国实际情况相结合的光辉体现。这在实行民族压迫的资本主义国家是不能想像的。
    宪法草案中关于公民的基本权利和义务一章，按照实际可能尽量地为人民的利益写下保证，并规定逐步扩大物质保证的措施，这跟资本主义国家宪法仅仅为少数人谋利益的条文形成了多么强烈的对照。
    这是一个具有历史意义的文件。它用简单明了的文字，记录了中国人民革命已有的成就，也指出了中国人民在共产党领导下继续努力的正确方向。这是照耀我们全国人民生活和工作的灯塔，是我们战斗的旗帜。毫无疑问，宪法草案的公布，必将在全国人民中间引起无比的快乐欢腾，在精神上武装全国人民，鼓舞全国人民向前迈进，为争取美好的社会主义的彻底实现而奋斗！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    乌兰夫的发言
    我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并建议中央人民政府委员会予以通过和批准公布。
    中华人民共和国宪法草案，是中国各民族人民长期的英勇革命斗争所获得的伟大成果的胜利总结；是使我国能够通过和平的道路，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的根本保证。它充分地反映与表达了全国各民族人民百年来梦寐以求的，已经实现和将要实现的共同愿望。
    中华人民共和国成立后，中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府在政治、经济、文化等各方面，业已保证了全国各少数民族人民的权利，实行了区域自治政策，现在更在宪法草案上全部明确地固定了下来，这就使全国各少数民族随着祖国建设事业的前进，发展其政治、经济、文化等事业，由落后民族提高到先进民族有了根本的保证。因此宪法草案一定能够为全国各少数民族人民所热诚拥护，全国各少数民族人民也一定和汉族人民一样，为之而空前热烈地欢欣鼓舞，更加增强热爱祖国的精神，更加衷心地爱戴与拥护中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府，从而大大加强祖国各民族人民的团结，为建成幸福繁荣的社会主义社会而主动积极地共同奋斗。

    刚才我听了宪法起草委员会的报告，感到非常兴奋。对于宪法草案的精神、内容、条文，一字一句，我完全拥护。并趁此机会，对亲自领导宪法起草的我们的伟大领袖毛主席，致以衷诚的崇高的敬意。
    这个宪法是我们中华人民共和国的第一个宪法，我能有机会参加这次宪法的起草工作，深感光荣。对于宪法草案的内容，大家发表的意见已经很多了，我自己也发表过不少的意见，现在我再补充一点感想：
    首先，目前国际形势错综复杂，美帝国主义一贯进行阴谋活动，为了保证我们国内的和平建设，为了维护远东与世界的和平，我们需要强有力的中央领导，因此，我以为毛主席亲自领导最高国务会议和国防委员会是非常必要的，这样才能迅速及时处理国家大事，我并且希望毛主席能领导我们胜利完成三个五年计划，建设社会主义，达到自由、平等、繁荣、富强的地位。
    其次，在讨论宪法序言的时候，我本来主张加添关于近百年来革命历史一段，因序言不好太长，不合体例，我便放弃这一意见。因为，我曾追随中山先生参加辛亥革命，孙先生对于推翻满清的封建专制统治，是有一定的功绩的，对于这一段历史，我认为有保存的价值。我个人觉得对于革命先烈有记录他们的史实的责任，因此，我希望在编历史教科书时，多写一点这方面的革命事实。
    最后，我希望全国人民，万众一心，来拥护这一宪法草案，努力宣传解释，并展开广泛的热烈的学习和讨论。
    陈叔通的发言
    今天由宪法起草委员会将这个中华人民共和国宪法草案向中央人民政府委员会提出。我们全国人民看了这个草案应该首先感觉到，我们的宪法是无数先烈鲜血制成的。序言中也说到百余年的斗争，我认为尤其是近三十年来共产党艰苦奋斗，在毛主席英明领导下解放了中国，建立了以工人阶级为领导以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的政权，又经过四年来政治上、经济上一系列的胜利，才能制定出这个宪法。所以全国人民看到了这个宪法是应该时时刻刻记住永垂不朽的先烈。
    就宪法说：
    一、我们宪法是社会主义类型的宪法，是从全体人民利益出发的，不同于资本主义宪法是从少数人利益出发的。
    二、我们宪法是将四年多以来经验，也可以说就是四年多以来的成果，以法律条文固定下来，因为这个成果是值得珍视的。
    三、我们宪法是过渡时期的宪法，所以我们尚不可能同于苏联已经建成了社会主义社会的宪法，而是正在走向社会主义社会的宪法，但本质是完全与苏联宪法相同的。
    四、我们宪法有纲领性，这是序言中所说，以共同纲领为基础，而又是共同纲领的发展；也就是如上所说把已取得的成果固定下来，同时也把广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望反映出来，也可以说就是过渡时期的总任务。
    五、我们宪法没有一句空言，应该做到的是应该写上去的，但是应该做而现在只能做到某种程度的，就做到某种程度写了上去；例如全民所有制代替资本家所有制是必然的；而现在尚不能不承认资本家所有制，所以宪法上既规定保护资本家所有制，同时又指出由利用、限制、改造而逐步做到以全民所有制来代替它；又如劳动权、休息权、教育权等都是应该规定的，但现在只能做到某种程度，亦写了上去。
    六、我们宪法草案公布以后，无疑地将受到全世界人民的注意。全世界人民将从这个宪法草案中认识到中国人民正以伟大的力量在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下从事于国内和平建设，所以这对于世界和平事业将有重大影响的。
    总之，我国宪法是符合于广大人民愿望的。宪法是中国人民自己的宪法。宪法内容是属于社会主义类型的宪法，又是体现国家过渡时期总任务的宪法，也是和平建设的宪法。最后，我表示我是绝对拥护这个宪法的。
    赛福鼎的发言
    中华人民共和国宪法草案的产生，是我国人民在生活上的唯一的新的历史事件。这一草案用法律保证我国人民为巩固以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政及共同建设社会主义新中国的伟大愿望而斗争。
    宪法草案中特别照顾和重视了中华人民共和国境内的各少数民族，草案中明确地规定了各少数民族和伟大的汉族人民一样，他们的自由和平等的权利得到保证，并在政治、经济和文化方面发展的巨大可能也得到保证。这在一方面将过去四年多来所实行的各少数民族极力拥护的正确的民族政策——共产党、毛主席民族政策的实际经验固定起来；另一方面，各少数民族紧密地团结在伟大的中华人民共和国大家庭之中，和伟大的汉族人民一起共同为建成伟大的社会主义中国而奋斗的愿望，也在宪法上固定下来。
    过去几百年来在各方面遭受严重蹂躏的各少数民族，必定为未来的幸福生活能以得到这种法律的保证而感到万分兴奋。
    我们的宪法草案是切实保证全国人民的一切愿望和要求的正确的人民宪法。
    因此，我完全同意和拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案，并建议中央人民政府委员会通过公布。
    程潜的发言
    我完全拥护中华人民共和国宪法草案。这个宪法草案初稿是中国共产党中央委员会向宪法起草委员会提出的，这个宪法草案是在毛主席亲自领导下起草的。宪法起草委员会和政协全国委员会、各大区、各省市等领导机关，曾经逐条地、反复地讨论过宪法草案，提出了一些修改意见。宪法起草委员会分别研究了并适当采择了这些意见，对宪法草案进行了缜密周详的修改，才形成了这个宪法草案。我在两个多月的学习和参加讨论中，能够有机会比较深入地钻研宪法草案的精神和实质，同时学习苏联及各人民民主国家的宪法，因而对宪法草案得到了一个基本的认识。我认为：我们的宪法草案是根据马克思列宁主义关于宪法学说的一般科学原则，结合中国的历史发展状态和国情而制订出来的。这个宪法草案是毛泽东思想的光辉结晶和天才创造。这个宪法草案总结了我国人民百余年来，特别是近三十年来反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的斗争经验和组织经验，纪录了人民革命胜利的伟大成果。这个宪法草案说明了我们国家在过渡时期经济结构的多成份性和社会主义经济的领导地位，明确地规定了社会主义经济成份的发展和对非社会主义经济成份进行改造的基本方针，深刻地反映了过渡时期总路线和总任务的实质，肯定地指出了国家向社会主义前进的方向。这个宪法草案把我国人民在革命斗争中逐步创造和发展起来的政治体制系统地进行了总结，规定了人民民主国家的国家机构。这个宪法草案同时还把公民的基本权利和义务，用法律的条文固定了下来。所以说，这个宪法草案体现了我国人民最高的和长远的利益，它具有无比的优越性。这种优越性，归根结底，正是导源于我们国家的人民民主制度。
    斯大林在“论苏联宪法草案”的报告中，曾经指出苏联宪法的几个基本特点，阐明了苏联宪法和资产阶级宪法的原则区别。我们国家现在正处于向社会主义过渡的历史阶段，和斯大林宪法一九三六年通过时社会主义已经胜利建成的情况，当然有许多不同。但是，如果从本质上来观察，我们的宪法草案与斯大林宪法，在基本特点上则是相同的。这主要表现在：第一、宪法草案不是凭空臆造，而是以事实为根据，把我国人民已经达到、已经争得的东西用立法手续固定起来；第二、宪法草案反映了国家在过渡时期的经济结构，指出了社会主义经济的领导地位，阐明了非社会主义经济成份经过改造，逐步达到社会主义所有制的内外条件和应该遵循的道路；第三、宪法草案正确地反映了我国阶级关系及阶级力量对比的实际情况，在宪法草案的第一条里，说明了人民民主国家的阶级成份，同时说明了国家的领导权属于工人阶级；第四、宪法草案具有深刻的国际主义性质，其出发点是一切种族和民族完全平等，毛主席关于解决国内民族问题的光辉思想，集中地反映在宪法草案的序言和第一章总纲第三条及第二章第四节部分条文、第五节的全部条文上面，这就为历史上最复杂的民族问题的解决，提供了有力的保证；第五、宪法草案根据国家发展的现状及趋势，作出了恰当的关于公民的基本权利和义务的规定，这些权利的规定不是徒托空言，而将要随着国家在各方面的发展进步，特别是经济事业的发展进步，予以保证和逐步实现。这就表明，我们的宪法草案遵循着社会主义民主主义的原则，完全不同于资本主义国家的虚伪的、多方限制的、形式的、假民主主义的所谓宪法。正是因为宪法草案具备了上面这些基本特点，体现了当代最进步的思想——即对人类进行社会主义改造的思想，所以我们的宪法草案和斯大林宪法、欧洲各人民民主国家的宪法，都属于宪法的同一最高历史类型——社会主义类型。
    我们的宪法草案是以“共同纲领为基础，又是共同纲领的发展”，显而易见，它本身就具有深刻的实践意义。既然我们能够在将近五年中胜利地完成了“共同纲领”规划的任务，那么，我们就有一切理由坚信，宪法所揭示的我们国家的社会主义远景，及为达到这一远景所当进行的斗争，也是能够胜利实现的。同时，宪法的通过，对于保证总路线的实现，又将起着十分重大的作用。因为“共同纲领”和宪法，都代表着我国人民在不同历史阶段的理想和愿望，代表着我国人民的要求和利益，所以它能得到人民的衷心拥护，并愿意为它的全部、彻底实现而努力。
