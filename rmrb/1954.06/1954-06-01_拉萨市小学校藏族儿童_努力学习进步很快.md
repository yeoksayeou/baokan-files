Tibetan children at Lhasa Primary School, under the influence of patriotic education, are studying diligently and making rapid progress. In their spare time, with the help of counselors, the children often practice Tibetan calligraphy and read picture books. Older students have organized reading groups and read Tibetan "News Briefs" to study current affairs. Many students also come to school during holidays to review their lessons. During last year's winter vacation, most of the students who were able to do homework completed vacation assignments. Currently, two-fifths of the students in the school have learned Tibetan phonetics and calligraphy, and more than seventy students are able to read Tibetan newspapers and write simple articles. In the past, it would have taken six or seven years to learn these skills.

Through their studies, and from newspapers, movies, slideshows, and picture books, the children have learned about the achievements of national construction and have become even more patriotic. After representatives from the Tibetan Tribute Delegation and the Tibetan Youth Visiting Group returned to Tibet, they gave the children detailed accounts of the progress of the motherland, further increasing their understanding of the great motherland. Tibetan children are very fond of stories of heroic figures, and many Soviet and New China heroes have become figures they admire. After listening to the stories of Zoya and Shura, many older female students wrote in their composition books about their admiration for the heroes. Chuique, a fourteen-year-old female student, learned from Zoya's spirit of helping others. During the winter vacation, she organized the neighbor's children to teach them to read and sing. After watching the slideshow film "Chicken Feather Letter," the elementary school students often play Haiwa's game, learning from Haiwa's exemplary actions of cherishing the country and loving the people's army. They regard protecting public property, helping each other, and studying diligently as expressions of patriotism. Every day before school ends, the students close the school's glass windows. Older students often help younger students review their lessons, wash writing boards, and sweep the floor.

    拉萨市小学校藏族儿童
    努力学习进步很快
    拉萨市小学校的藏族儿童在爱国主义教育下，努力学习，进步很快，在课外时间，儿童们也经常在辅导员帮助下练习藏文书法和阅读画报。高年级的学生们组织了读报小组、阅读藏文“新闻简讯”，学习时事。许多学生在假期和节日里还到学校来复习功课。去年寒假期间，全校有作业能力的学生大都作了假期作业。现在全校已有五分之二的学生学会了藏文拼音和书法，有七十多个学生已能读藏文书报，写简单的文章。这些成绩，在过去需要六七年的时间才能学到。
    儿童们从学习中，从报纸、电影、幻灯和画报上了解了祖国建设的成就，更加热爱祖国。西藏致敬团和西藏青年参观团的代表回西藏后，给儿童们详细地介绍了祖国前进的情况，更增加了他们对伟大祖国的认识。藏族儿童们非常喜欢英雄人物的故事，许多苏联和新中国的英雄已成为他们敬仰的人物。高年级的女学生们听了卓娅和舒拉的故事后，很多人都在作文本上写下自己羡慕英雄的心情。十四岁的女学生的却学习卓娅帮助别人的精神，寒假期间，她把邻居的孩子们组织起来教他们认字、唱歌。小学生们看了“鸡毛信”的幻灯影片后，经常做海娃的游戏，学习海娃爱护国家、爱护人民军队的模范行动。他们把爱护公共财物、互相帮助、努力学习当做热爱祖国的表现。每天放学前，学生们便把学校的玻璃窗关好，年龄较大的学生经常帮助小学生温习功课、洗习字板和扫地。
