Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The People's Vote on the question: "Do you support a peace treaty and the withdrawal of foreign occupying forces, or do you support the 'European Defense Community' treaty and the 'General Treaty' and the continued stationing of occupying forces for fifty years?" began at 6:00 AM on June 27th in the German Democratic Republic.

All citizens of the German Democratic Republic who are sixteen years of age or older have the right to vote. The People's Vote is direct and secret.

As previously reported, in the days leading up to the vote, rallies were held throughout the Republic, with participants expressing their support for the German Democratic Republic government's decision to hold the vote. Berlin's democratic newspapers reported that mass meetings were held on June 26 in Leipzig, Schwerin, Magdeburg, Frankfurt an der Oder, Halle, Weimar, and other cities in the German Democratic Republic. Approximately 16,000 employees of the state-owned "Leuna" chemical plant participated in a staff meeting, at which Karl Schirdewan, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, delivered a speech.

In the Democratic districts of Berlin, adorned in festive attire, more than 800 polling stations opened their doors simultaneously at 6:00 AM on the 27th. Workers just finishing their night shifts and passengers arriving and departing by train were among the first voters at the polling stations in the factory districts and the East Station. Many residents of Stalin Avenue and other residential areas went to the polls in groups to vote. Elderly couples supported each other, young couples carried their children, and disabled people sat in wheelchairs, creating a very touching scene. An elderly woman nearly eighty years old, the first to vote at the tenth polling station on Stalin Avenue, told the polling station staff before voting: "I have experienced too much, and I know what I am voting for. Only peace can ensure that us elderly mothers no longer have to worry." At the "Home for the Blind" special polling station on Gottwald Street, 100% of the votes were cast by the morning.

The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Walter Ulbricht, both voted early in the morning at the polling station located in the Presidential Palace.

In other regions of the German Democratic Republic, the People's Vote is also proceeding enthusiastically. Workers, collective farmers, and citizens in Leipzig, Halle, Dresden, Stalinstadt, Rostock, Frankfurt an der Oder, Karl-Marx-Stadt, and other places are also actively casting their votes. According to the German News Agency, residents of Wiesendal village in the Frankfurt district cast 100% of their votes by 10:15 AM. Members of the "Red Star" agricultural production cooperative in the Wittstock district had all voted by 6:30 AM.

Voting continues until June 29th.

    德意志民主共和国人民积极参加人民投票
    据新华社讯：“你赞成和约和撤退外国占领军呢？还是赞成‘欧洲防务集团’条约和‘一般性条约’以及让占领军继续留驻五十年呢？”这个问题的人民投票已于六月二十七日上午六时在德意志民主共和国开始。
    德意志民主共和国的全体公民，只要年满十六岁，都有权利投票。人民投票是直接而秘密的。
    如前所报道的，在举行投票以前的一些日子里，共和国各地纷纷举行集会，与会者表示拥护德意志民主共和国政府举行投票的决定。柏林民主报纸报道，在来比锡、什未林、马格德堡、奥得河畔法兰克福、哈雷、魏玛和德意志民主共和国的其他城市，在六月二十六日举行了群众大会。国营“伦那”化学工厂的职工大会大约有一万六千人参加，在会上，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员卡尔·希德万发表了演说。
    在披上节日盛装的柏林民主区，八百多个投票站在二十七日早晨六点钟都一齐开了门。刚刚下了夜班的工人和上下火车的旅客分别在工厂区和东车站的投票站抢先作了第一批的投票人。在斯大林大街和其他住宅区的许多居民都成群结队到投票站去投票。老年的夫妇互相搀扶着、年青的夫妇携带着儿女、残废的人坐在手推车里，情景十分动人。在斯大林大街第十投票站最先投票的一位年近八十岁的老太太，在投票前向投票站的人员说：“我经历得太多了，我知道投票赞成什么。只有和平才能保证我们这老年的母亲不再忧愁。”在哥特瓦尔德大街的“盲人之家”特别投票站在上午就百分之百的投完了票。
    德意志民主共和国总理奥·格罗提渥和副总理瓦·乌布利希都一早就在总统府所在地的投票站投了票。
    在德意志民主共和国其他地区，人民投票也正在热烈进行。来比锡、哈雷、德累斯顿、斯大林斯塔特、罗斯托克、奥得河畔法兰克福、卡尔·马克思斯塔特等地的工人、集体农民和市民也都踊跃地投了票。据德意志通讯社消息：法兰克福区维森达尔乡的居民在上午十点一刻就百分之百的投了票。威特史托克区“红星”农业生产合作社的社员在早晨六点半钟就全部投完了票。
    投票还在继续进行，直到六月二十九日为止。
