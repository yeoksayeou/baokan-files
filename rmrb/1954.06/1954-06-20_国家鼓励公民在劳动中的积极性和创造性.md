The warm feeling of Zhang Mingshan
Zhang Mingshan, Deputy Director of the Small Rolling Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel, and Special-Class Labor Model of Anshan City, thought of his research on anti-overturning discs in 1952 when he saw the draft constitution. One day, he went to the factory director and said, "I want to test the anti-overturning disc I'm researching. I'm not sure if it will work, but it would be best if you could give me four hours of testing time." The factory director said, "I'll reply tomorrow." At the time, he thought: The factory is currently promoting advanced experience, how could they give me four hours! But the next day, the factory director called him in and said with a smile, "Go ahead, Lao Zhang! I'll give you eight hours to experiment." Hearing this, his confidence in the research was greatly strengthened. This is just a small example. Throughout the entire process of trial-producing the anti-overturning disc, the Party and the state gave him a lot of help in terms of ideology and material. Therefore, he felt very close to the provisions in the draft constitution regarding encouraging and helping citizens in creative work in science, education, etc. He said: I support this draft constitution from the bottom of my heart, and I will more actively participate in the ranks of technological innovation and ensure that I play a key role in the movement.

Creating Greater Happiness with Labor
After receiving the newspaper on the 15th, Wang Chonglun, Special-Class Labor Model of Anshan City and planer in the tool workshop, read every article of the draft constitution. He said: After reading the draft constitution, I thought of my creation of the universal tool tire last year, which was successful only with the strong support of the leadership. This kind of support for workers' inventions and creations is now fixed in the draft constitution: "The state encourages the initiative and creativity of citizens in labor." "The state encourages and assists the creative work of citizens engaged in science, education, literature, art, and other cultural undertakings." I feel that only creative labor can bring us greater happiness, and this is precisely protected by the constitution.

Remembering the Past from the Scar on His Head
Wang Wenshan, Director of the Workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and City Labor Model, said after seeing the draft constitution: If I had lived in such a society six years ago, I wouldn't have such a scar on my head. When the Japanese devils were here, I remember one day I was eating lunch, and a Japanese devil insisted that I put down my lunch box and get him hot water. Before I could understand him, another Japanese devil hit me on the head with a pair of tongs. I couldn't dodge in time, and my head was broken, and blood flowed straight down. I will never forget this incident in my life. After the Japanese devils surrendered, the Kuomintang bandits, relying on the support of the American devils, looted the factory's equipment, the factory closed down, and I lost my job and had to go to the countryside to farm. However, during the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, it was difficult for farmers to survive. Our family of several people couldn't even afford sorghum bran, and we hadn't bought a foot of cloth in several years. At that time, the work and life of our workers and peasants were not guaranteed, let alone freedom, democracy, and equality!

After liberation, I returned to the factory. Comrade Ma Zhengkun, the secretary of the Party branch in the workshop, told me: The factory belongs to the working class. Now that we workers are working in the factory, we are working for ourselves, and the Communist Party is the party of our working class. At first, I didn't understand it, but later I saw a management committee in the factory, with many workers in it. I also saw them often meeting with the factory director and other responsible comrades. I asked them what they were doing? They said that everyone was discussing and solving some major problems in the factory. I thought: We workers are really the leading class. In the old society, we had no right to speak. Now we not only have legally stipulated working hours and enjoy labor insurance, but also have the power to manage the factory. We are really masters of our own affairs.

Now, the draft constitution fixes the rights of the working class through legislative procedures. This is such an exciting thing! I want to work with everyone in the spirit of technological innovation to do a good job in the preparations for the official production of the 1A62 workshop, especially the personnel training. We must ensure that the machine tools are not damaged, strictly implement the machine tool maintenance system, issue machine tool operating licenses after examinations, implement machine tool use contracts signed by workers and workshop directors, and implement a pre-repair system to ensure that the precision machine tools from the Soviet Union achieve maximum effectiveness. This will lay the foundation for the mass production of the 1A62 workshop. This is my practical action to support the draft constitution.

Labor is the Most Glorious
Zhu Shunyu, a labor model in Shanghai's hardware industry, read the draft constitution word by word several times, and the more he read, the happier he became. Article 1 of the draft constitution stipulates that "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." This is something to be very happy about!

Zhu Shunyu started working at the age of thirteen. When he worked at the Shanghai Far East Steel Drum Factory, he worked more than ten hours a day in that dark and stuffy workshop, but the wages he earned were not even enough to eat porridge. But the boss took the money and lived a licentious and shameless life. Later, he lost his job and became a rickshaw puller and peddler. In 1948, he entered the pseudo-Resources Committee General Machinery Factory as a fitter. One day, he went to work on an empty stomach. He felt dizzy and weak while working, and was hit in the waist by the drill press plate. He vomited blood on the spot, but the bureaucratic capitalists did not take it seriously, did not give him any medical expenses, and kicked him out of the factory.

When Zhu Shunyu saw the article in the draft constitution stipulating that "Labor is a glorious thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work," he couldn't help but feel a surge of emotions. He said: "To stipulate labor as a glorious thing in the constitution is something that has never happened in Chinese history. In the old society, labor was regarded as a 'base' thing, and the reactionaries scolded us as 'stinky workers.' They said, 'You can't find a three-legged dog, but you can find two-legged people.' Now it's different, labor is the most glorious, and the working class has become the leading class."

He deeply realized that being a worker is the greatest happiness. He made the following guarantees: actively participate in the discussion and study of the draft constitution, and at the same time, continue to cooperate with workers and technicians in the technological innovation movement, strive to innovate technology, and mobilize the workers of the whole factory to complete the trial production of the blades of China's first steam turbine before National Day as a gift to National Day.

Maintain Honor
The workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory were all beaming with joy, talking about the draft constitution everywhere. Feng Yunyuan, a quiet and taciturn excellent old worker, felt particularly deeply about the article in the draft constitution that "Labor is a glorious thing for all citizens of the People's Republic of China who have the ability to work." Forty years of hard work have trained him to become an experienced and skilled worker, but in the old society he was always despised. In 1945, as his old age approached, the thing he feared most finally happened, and he was fired from the factory. Driven by life, he wandered to Shanghai and fell ill there, suffering all kinds of hardships. After liberation, he returned to the factory. His excellent skills were respected by all the workers in the factory, and he was elected as a labor model of the factory. Now, Master Feng personally saw that the glory of labor was going to be written into the fundamental law of the country, and he could not suppress the joy in his heart. He said, "I want to maintain my honor. Everyone calls me Master, but in the future I will also be an apprentice and earnestly learn advanced experience."

Continue to Work Hard to Expand Achievements
Huang Demao, a special-class labor model in Anshan City, was a construction worker before liberation. At that time, he suffered from unemployment every year, ate bran, wore "regenerated cloth," and his family of two or three shared a quilt, and the children cried from the cold at night. He himself was beaten by the Japanese devils in the factory every now and then. Life was not guaranteed, let alone any creativity and invention. After liberation, this kind of life ended, the workers became the masters of the country, and were taken care of by the state. The year before last, he got sick, and the factory sent him to a sanatorium for more than two months of recuperation; his creative labor in production was also encouraged. After seeing the draft constitution, he happily said: The vital interests of our working class will be further guaranteed. Using our newly researched and successfully manufactured steel bar forming machine, the output in the first and second weeks has already exceeded this year's new quota by an average of more than 22 percent. We will work hard to continue to improve the machine and expand our achievements so that our country can transition to a socialist society as soon as possible.

### 国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性

    国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性
    张明山的亲切感觉
    鞍钢小型轧钢厂副厂长、鞍山市特等劳动模范张明山，在看到宪法草案以后，想起了他在一九五二年研究反围盘时的情况。他有一天去找厂长说：“我研究的反围盘想试验一下，好不好使还没准，可是最好你能给我四个钟头的试验时间。”厂长说：“明天答复。”当时他想：厂子里正在搞推广先进经验的工作，那能给我四个钟头呀！可是第二天厂长把他找去，笑着对他说：“干吧，老张！给你八个钟头时间试验。”他一听，大大加强了研究的信心。这不过是一个小例子。在试制反围盘的整个过程中，党和国家在思想上和物质上给了他很多的帮助。因此，他对宪法草案上关于鼓励和帮助公民在科学、教育等方面的创造性工作的规定，感觉到十分亲切。他说：我从心里拥护这个宪法草案，我将更积极地参加到技术革新的行列中来，并保证在运动中起骨干作用。
    用劳动创造更大幸福
    鞍山市特等劳动模范、工具车间刨工王崇伦接到十五日的报纸后，把宪法草案的每一条都读过了。他说：看了宪法草案，就想起了自己去年创造万能工具胎的事情，那是在领导方面大力支持下，才得到成功的。这种对工人发明创造的支持，今天在宪法草案中固定下来了：“国家鼓励公民在劳动中的积极性和创造性”。“国家对于从事科学、教育、文学、艺术和其他文化事业的公民的创造性工作，给以鼓励和帮助”。我感到只有创造性的劳动，才能使我们有更大的幸福，而这正是受宪法所保护的。
    从头上的疤痕想起往事
    沈阳第一机床厂车间主任、市劳动模范王文山看到宪法草案后说：如果我在六年以前是生活在这样一个社会里，头上就不会有这样一个疤痕了。日本鬼子在时，记得有一天我正在吃午饭，一个日本鬼子硬叫我放下饭盒，给他去打开水，我还没有听懂他的话，另外一个日本鬼子就劈头一火钳子打来，我来不及躲避，头被打破了，鲜血直流。这件事情我一生也忘记不了。日本鬼子投降了，国民党匪帮靠着美国鬼子撑腰，劫走了工厂里的器材，工厂关了门，我失了业，只好到乡下种地。但是，在国民党匪帮统治时期，农民也是难得活命的。我们一家几口人，连高粱糠都吃不上，几年来没有买过一尺布。那时，我们工人、农民的工作和生活都没有保障，还谈得上什么自由、民主和平等！
    解放后，我又回到了工厂。车间党支部书记马正坤同志告诉我：工厂是工人阶级自己的，现在咱们工人在工厂里干活，就是为自己干的，共产党就是咱们工人阶级的政党。我起初还弄不通，往后我看见工厂里有一个管理委员会，里面还有很多工人，我又看见他们时常和厂长这些负责同志在一起开会。我问他们干什么？他们说是大伙商量解决工厂里的一些主要问题。我想：咱们工人真是领导阶级了，旧社会哪有咱们说话的权利，现在不光有法定的工作时间，享受劳动保险，还有管理工厂的大权，我们真是当家作主了。
    现在，宪法草案中用立法的手续把工人阶级的权利固定起来。这是一件多么使人感到兴奋的事情啊！我要和大家一起以技术革新的精神，搞好一A六二车间正式生产前的各项准备工作，特别是人员培训工作，要做到机床不损坏，严格执行机床保养制度，经过考试后，发给机床使用执照，实行工人与车间主任签订机床使用合同，实行预修制，保证苏联的精密机床发挥最大效果。以便给一A六二车间大批生产打下基础。这就是我拥护宪法草案的实际行动。
    劳动是最光荣的
    上海五金工业劳动模范朱顺余一字一句地把宪法草案看了几遍，越看心里越高兴。宪法草案第一条就规定“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家”。这是多么值得高兴的呀！
    朱顺余十三岁就出来做工。在上海远东钢桶厂做工时，他每天在那又黑又闷的车间里工作十多个钟点，但所得的工资连吃稀饭都不够。可是老板却把钱拿去过着荒淫无耻的生活。后来他失了业，去踏三轮车、跑单帮。一九四八年，进了伪资源委员会通用机器厂做钳工，有一天他饿着肚子上工，做工时眼花无力，被钻床压板打中腰部，当场口吐鲜血，而官僚资本家却没有把这事看在眼里，医药费分文不给，就把他一脚踢出厂子。
    朱顺余看到宪法草案中规定的“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情”这一条时，不禁万感交集。他说：“把劳动作为一件光荣的事情订到宪法里来，在我们中国历史上是从来没有的事。在旧社会，劳动被看成是‘下贱’的事情，反动派骂我们是‘臭工人’，他们说，‘找三条腿的狗没有，找两条腿的人有。’如今不同了，劳动是最光荣的，工人阶级成了领导阶级。”
    他深深地体会到作一个工人是最大的幸福。他提出如下保证：积极地参加宪法草案的讨论和学习，同时要在技术革新运动中继续和工人、技术人员合作，努力革新技术，动员全厂工人在国庆节前夕完成我国第一台汽轮机的试造叶片任务，作为向国庆节的献礼。
    要保持荣誉
    北京人民印刷厂的工人个个心花怒放，到处谈论着宪法草案。沉默寡言的优秀老工人冯允元对宪法草案中“劳动是中华人民共和国一切有劳动能力的公民的光荣事情”这一条感触特别深。四十来年的辛勤劳动，把他锻炼成为一个经验丰富技术熟练的工人，但在旧社会他一直被人卑视。一九四五年，随着晚年的到来，他最担心的事情终于发生了，他被工厂开除了。被生活所迫，他流浪到上海，病倒在那里，受尽了折磨。解放后，他才又回到了这个工厂。他的优良技术受到了全厂职工的尊敬，并当选为厂的劳动模范。现在冯师傅亲眼看到把劳动光荣这一条要订到国家根本大法上去了，捺不住心头的喜悦，他说：“我要保持荣誉。大家都叫我师傅，可是今后我还要作徒弟，认真地学习先进经验。”
    继续努力扩大成果
    鞍山市特等劳动模范黄德茂，解放以前就是建筑工人。那时他每年都受到失业的痛苦，吃的是糠皮，穿的是“更生布”，家里两三口人盖一床被子，晚间小孩冻得直叫。他自己在工厂里做工，三天两头挨日本鬼子打。生活没有保障，更谈不到什么创造发明了。解放以后，这种生活才结束了，工人做了国家的主人，受到国家照顾。前年，他得了病，工厂就把他送到休养所休养了两个多月；他在生产中的创造性劳动也得到鼓励。他看到宪法草案后高兴得说：我们工人阶级的切身利益将要得到进
  一步的保障了。我们使用自己新研究成功的钢筋成型机，在第一、二周的产量已经平均超过今年的新定额百分之二十二多。我们将要努力继续改进机器，扩大我们的成果，使我国早日过渡到社会主义社会。
