How the Tian'e Agricultural Production Cooperative Implemented Short-Term Contract Production
Zheng Guowu

The Tian'e Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hedong Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, has a total of eighteen member households. In order to avoid idling, the cooperative initially implemented division of labor and group production, but without contract setting and quality standards. As a result, there was mutual suspicion among the production groups when evaluating work and recording points, and the enthusiasm of the members could not be fully utilized. Therefore, some members raised the demand for implementing short-term contract production.

Several Ideological Concerns Encountered in Implementing Short-Term Contract Production

Local farmers were accustomed to contract work in many tasks such as water pumping, rice transplanting, and grain harvesting. In addition, the cooperative had previously contracted out the task of digging pond mud for fertilizer, and most members were able to appreciate the benefits of contract labor. Of the cooperative's twenty-two male laborers, seventeen basically agreed to contract work, including four who actively advocated it, and five who disagreed. This shows that there was a preliminary mass ideological basis for implementing short-term contract production. However, the benefits of contract production had not been systematically summarized in the past, and the members did not have a comprehensive and profound understanding of its advantages. The cadres also felt that they lacked experience and did not know how to proceed. When starting to implement contract work, the following ideas were found:

First, there was a widespread fear of inaccurate contracts. Cooperative member Xie Kaishan said, "I am willing to contract, but I am afraid that the contract will not be accurate." Xie Songdong said, "Some fields are large, some fields are small, some fields have long banks, and some fields have short banks. How can the contract be accurate?"

Second, a small number of people with weak labor power were worried about keeping up with the work and getting fewer work points.

Third, people who were not diligent in their work were afraid of suffering after contracting. Cooperative member Song Xiaoxi was relatively lazy and said, "With contract work, the elderly will die quickly, and the young people will age quickly!"

Fourth, people with strong labor power wanted to contract, but were afraid that others would say they wanted to get more work points, and did not dare to express their attitude.

The cooperative committee also hesitated when faced with these ideological situations of the members. Of the seven members, only one insisted on implementing contract work, two were "indifferent," three reluctantly agreed, and one disagreed. With inconsistent ideological understanding among the leadership core, short-term contract production was difficult to implement.

Taking the Method of Typical Analysis and Comprehensive Summary to Conduct Ideological Mobilization at All Levels

In response to the ideological situation of the cadres and members, the Party branch first convened a meeting of Party members to persuade and mobilize them to unify their thinking. Then, it convened an enlarged meeting of the cooperative committee with the participation of production team leaders and work recorders, and used the method of typical analysis and comprehensive summary to educate them on the advantages of contract work. The person presiding over the meeting first asked, "Let's talk about how Xie Kaishu's production was before joining the cooperative?" Some said, "Xie Kaishu is a diligent person." Some said, "Xie Kaishu has always worked hard, and he is skilled in all kinds of farming tasks." The person presiding over the meeting then asked, "How is his production after joining the cooperative?" No one answered this question for a long time. Later, someone said, "Xie Kaishu got up especially early one day, and his work was fast and good. When recording work points, he was rewarded with half a point, and many members had opinions and shouted loudly. Xie Kaishu was a little annoyed, and has never gotten up early since then, and his enthusiasm for work has also declined." The person presiding over the meeting then asked, "How did Xie Kaishu perform last time when he contracted to dig pond mud?" Everyone rushed to say, "Ah ha! He worked very hard that day! He did the work of two days in one day, and he didn't even bother to rest." In this way, everyone naturally talked about the benefits of contract work. Some said, "Contract work is called remuneration according to labor!" Some said, "Do as much work as you eat, the more you do, the more energetic you are!" "In the past, calculating workdays was like sharing the work equally, which hurt feelings and became increasingly boring. Who would be willing to work hard?" On the basis of analyzing typical examples, the person leading the meeting further comprehensively summarized the situation of the last contract to dig pond mud: Before the contract, nineteen laborers dug pond mud at the entrance of Fu's house, dug little, and walked slowly. Six hundred loads of pond mud had not been dug in a whole day, which was lower than the general work efficiency, wasting about five workdays. After the contract, thirteen laborers dug pond mud at the entrance of Hua's house. Everyone not only did not rest, but even did not bother to drink tea. Eight hundred loads of pond mud were dug in less than a day. Through comprehensive summary, the people attending the meeting further realized the advantages of contract production and the necessity of implementing the contract system. Some said, "Contract work has three speeds - fast eating, fast walking, and fast working." Some said, "After the contract, there are three no-calls - no need to call to get up in the morning, no need to call to go to the fields after meals, and no need to call to arrange production." They also realized that contract work can reasonably calculate workdays, promote the responsibility system in production, and strengthen the planning in production. In this way, the differences in opinions among the leadership members on the implementation of the short-term contract system were eliminated, and ideological understanding was unified.

After unifying ideological understanding and deciding to implement contract work, in view of the ideological situation of some people and the possible deviations after contract production, the boundaries between rest and laziness, active production and blindly increasing labor intensity were clarified, and the slogans "Work hard and rest easily" and "Reasonably arrange production time, do what must be done, and rest when necessary!" were put forward to dispel the concerns that contract production would exhaust people, and to eliminate the misunderstandings of some people who believed that implementing contract work was to whip production and was labor reform.

The number of people participating in this enlarged meeting of the cooperative committee accounted for more than half of the cooperative's male labor force. After the meeting, they immediately went to the production teams and explained the benefits of short-term contract work, starting from summarizing the previous stage of production and combining it with the current production. In-depth mobilization was also carried out individually for members who had resistance or too much misunderstanding and concern. A special symposium for female members was also held to mobilize women. After such publicity and mobilization, the members had a consensus on the implementation of short-term contract work.

Fully Promote Democracy and Formulate Contract Plans

When studying the contract methods, the members were very nervous. Everyone demanded that the contract be reasonable and feared being at a disadvantage. In order to make the contract accurate and good, a meeting of cadres was first convened, starting from checking and summarizing leadership methods, criticizing departmentalism, and conducting education on the overall concept. At the meeting, production team leader Zhou Zhongbi said, "Last time when we contracted to carry manure, we originally planned to contract it to another team, and I advocated setting the quantity higher and the work points lower. As a result, it was contracted to our team, and we had to suffer in our hearts and complain while holding our noses. In the future, when implementing contract work, whether it is contracted to Zhang San or Li Si, we must have a fair mind." Zhou Zhongmei said, "That's right. As a cadre, we must think for the whole cooperative and make big plans. If the contract is not accurate in the future, we will not be able to give play to the members' enthusiasm for production, and we will not be able to produce more grain. In the end, everyone will suffer."

After correcting the attitude of the cadres, a meeting of the cooperative committee was convened to draft a contract plan. According to the specific situation of the cooperative, the farmland was first classified into two major categories: white fields and spring-harvested fields. White fields and spring-harvested fields were each divided into four grades. Dry land was classified according to the types of crops such as cotton fields, sesame fields, bean fields, and sweet potato fields. After the farmland was classified and ranked, representative plots were selected from each category and each grade of farmland as standard fields, and then, according to the principle of "starting from reality, doing what one can, contracting what can be contracted, and not forcing what cannot be contracted," it was determined which tasks in the standard fields were contracted and which tasks were not. After finding the tasks to be contracted, the quality standards were determined, and the amount of labor used per unit area, that is, the standard amount of labor, was calculated according to the quality standards. Then, based on the standard amount of labor, the same type and grade of farmland were brought closer together, subtracting points for those that were easy to cultivate and adding points for those that were difficult to cultivate.

After the draft contract plan was drawn up, democracy was fully promoted, and all members were mobilized to discuss it; opinions were widely solicited through various methods. When mobilizing members to discuss, sufficient time was stipulated, and it was stated that revisions were welcome and "reversals" were allowed. After full deliberation, discussion, democratic review, and revision, it was finally passed as a plan, so the members felt satisfied.

After the democratic decision was made, collectivism education was further carried out for the members, starting from improving the production of the whole cooperative, and following the principle of "basing on proximity of residence and contiguity of farmland, appropriately taking into account the quality of the farmland, the strength of the labor force, the level of technology, the distribution of key personnel, and the appropriate combination of white fields and spring-harvested fields," the land was divided into plots and the labor force was divided into groups. Absolute equality was not emphasized between groups, but attention was also paid to not making the disparity too great. Some farmland was not easy to divide, so some groups contracted a little more appropriately, and some groups contracted a little less.

After the contract, the members' enthusiasm for labor was brought into play, and production efficiency was significantly improved. According to preliminary summary: the production efficiency of strong laborers increased by 30% to 50% compared to before the contract; the production efficiency of medium laborers increased by 20% to 30%; and even people with weak labor power could complete the contract amount, and some even slightly increased their production efficiency compared to before the contract. From this aspect, it can also be seen that the quotas formulated through full discussion and democratic formulation are generally more accurate.

Three Issues to Pay Attention to After Contract Production

Judging from the situation of the cooperative, attention should be paid to solving three problems after contract production:

(1) Organize and lead labor competitions in an organized and led manner. After dividing into groups, dividing into plots, and contracting production, competition naturally appeared between groups. Allowing this emotion to develop freely would inevitably lead to the phenomenon of mutual "sabotage" and disunity. It is necessary to seize the members' enthusiasm for production in a timely manner, conduct patriotic production increase education and collectivism education, guide the enthusiasm of the masses for labor to the correct path, and conduct labor competitions between groups and individual members in a led and organized manner. Carrying out labor competitions is an effective method to give play to the members' enthusiasm for labor and improve production efficiency, and leadership must be emphasized.

(2) Conduct regular inspections and evaluations to promote advanced production experience and ensure that the quality of work is not reduced. Although quality standards have been set for short-term contracts, the phenomenon of rushing to work and seeking speed without paying attention to quality still often occurs after the contract due to the lack of production targets. It is necessary to establish a quality inspection system and conduct mass inspections and evaluations regularly while strengthening political and ideological education. Inspections and evaluations can not only ensure that the quality of work is not reduced, but also play a role in disseminating and promoting advanced production experience. Cooperative committee members can divide responsibility areas and lead this work in separate areas.

(3) After the contract, the phenomenon of exhausting cattle often occurs due to rushing to work and seeking speed. It is necessary to find ways to do a good job in the feeding and management of cattle.

    天鹅农业生产合作社是怎样实行短期包工生产的
    郑国武
    湖北省浠水县河东乡天鹅农业生产合作社共有十八户社员。为避免发生窝工现象，这个社一开始就实行分工分组生产，但没有包工定质。这样，评工记分时各生产小组间相互怀疑，社员劳动积极性不能充分发挥。因此有些社员产生了实行短期包工的要求。
    实行短期包工碰到的几种思想顾虑
    当地农民在车水、插秧、割谷等不少活路中，往年就有包工习惯。加以该社积肥时曾包工挑过塘泥，多数社员都能体会到包工干活的好处。全社二十二个男劳动力，基本同意包工的有十七个人，其中积极主张包工的四人，不同意包工的五人。这说明实行短期包工已初步具备了群众的思想基础。但包工生产的好处过去没有系统总结过，社员对它的优越性还体会得不全面、不深刻；干部也觉得缺乏经验，不好下手。在着手实行包工时，发现有这样几种思想：
    第一，普遍怕包不准。社员谢开善说：“我是愿意包的，就怕包不准。”谢宋东说：“有的田大、有的田小，有的田岸长，有的田岸短，怎么样能包得准确？”
    第二，少数劳动力弱的人打不开算盘，怕做活跟不上趟少得工分。
    第三，做活不勤快的人怕包工后受累。社员宋小西比较懒，他说：“包起工来，老年人死得快，后生家老得快！”
    第四，劳动力强的人想包，但怕人说自己想多得工分，也不敢表示态度。
    社委碰到社员这些思想情况，也犹豫了。七个委员，坚持主张实行包工的只有一个人，两个人“无所谓”，三个人勉强同意，一个人不同意。领导核心思想认识不一致，短期包工就难贯彻实行。
    采取典型分析和全面总结的方法层层进行思想动员
    党支部针对干部和社员的思想情况，首先召开了党员会议，说服动员，统一思想认识。接着召开了有生产组长和记工员参加的社务委员会扩大会议，采取由典型分析和全面总结的方法，进行包工优越性的教育。主持会的人首先提出：“大家扯扯谢开树这个人入社前生产怎么样？”有的说：“谢开树可是个勤快人。”有的说：“谢开树一向是起早贪黑地干活，庄稼活样样都得门。”主持会的人又问：“他入社后生产怎么样？”这一问，很久没人吭气。后来有个人说：“谢开树有天起得特别早，活做得又快又好，记工时奖励他半分，好多社员有意见，高声叫喊，谢开树有些呕气，从那以后再没起过早，做活劲头也不大了。”主持会的人又问道：“上次包挑塘泥谢开树表现得好不好？”大家抢着说：“啊哈！那天他干得可有劲啦！一天顶两天做的活，歇也顾不得歇了。”这样，大家自然都扯起包工的好处来。有的说：“包工做活才叫按劳取酬哩！”有的说：“做多大的活，吃多大的馍馍（指得分工），越干越有劲！”“过去算劳动日有些打伙扯平的样子，扯来扯去伤感情，越来越没味道，那个还愿意努力生产呢？”在分析典型的基础上，领导开会的人进一步把上次包挑塘泥的情况，作了全面的总结：包工前十九个劳动力在傅家门口挑塘泥，挑得少，走得慢，六百担塘泥，挑一整天还没有挑完，比一般工作效率还低，约浪费了五个工，包工后十三个劳动力在华家门口挑塘泥，大家不但没休息，连茶也顾不得喝。八百担塘泥，不到一天便挑完了。通过全面总结，到会的人进一步体会到包工生产的优越性和实行包工制的必要。有的说：“包工有三快——吃饭快、走路快、做活快。”有的说：“包工后三不叫——早晨起床不用叫，饭后下田不用叫，安排生产不用叫。”又认识到包工能合理地计算劳动日，能促进生产上的责任制，能加强生产中的计划性等好处。这样一来，领导成员间对实行短期包工制的分歧意见消除了，思想认识统一了。
    在统一了思想认识，决定实行包工的基础上，又针对某些人的思想情况和包工生产后可能发生的偏向，划清了休息与偷懒、积极生产与盲目提高劳动强度的界线，提出口号：“紧张地劳动，轻松地休息”；“合理安排生产时间，须做就做，须歇就歇！”以此解除怕包工生产累坏人的顾虑，清除某些人认为实行包工是加鞭生产，是劳动改造等误解。
    参加这次社务委员会扩大会议的人数，占全社男劳动力的半数以上。会后他们即分头以生产小组为单位，从总结前段生产入手，结合当前生产，向大家说明短期包工的好处。对抵触情绪或误解、顾虑太大的社员，还个别进行了深入发动。又专门召开女社员座谈会，发动妇女。经过这样的宣传发动以后，社员对实行短期包工有了一致的认识。
    充分发扬民主，制订包工方案
    在研究包工办法时，社员思想很紧张。人人要求包得合理，怕吃亏“上当”。为了把工包准、包好，首先召开了干部会，从检查、总结领导方法入手，批判本位主义思想，进行整体观念教育。在会上，生产组长周仲毕说：“上次包工挑粪时，原先计划包给别组挑，我主张把量定高些、工分定低些。结果包给我们组挑了，只好痛在心里，捏着鼻子叫苦。以后实行包工，不管是包给张三、李四，都得拿出公正心来。”周仲梅说：“这才说对了。当个干部，要为全社着想，打大算盘。今后包工，如果包不准，就不能发挥社员们的生产积极性，就不能多打粮食，九九归一，还是大家吃亏。”
    端正了干部的态度以后，接着召开了社务委员会，拟包工草案。根据社里具体情况，先把田地分类站队，把稻田分为白田和春收田两大类，白田和春收田又各分为四等。旱地按棉花地、芝麻地、豆地、苕地等作物种类分类。田地分类排队以后，在每一类、每一等田地中选择有代表性的田块作为标准田，再根据“从实际出发，量力而行，能包者包，不能包者不勉强包”的原则，进而确定标准田中那些活路包工做，那些活路不包。找出包的活路后，确定质量标准，并根据质量标准，算出单位面积上的用工数，即标准工数。再以标准工为基础，同一类型，同一等级田地丘丘靠拢，耕作容易的减分，耕作困难的加分。
    包工草案拟出后，充分发扬民主，发动全体社员讨论；通过各种方式、方法，广泛征求意见。发动社员讨论时，规定了充分的时间，并声明欢迎修改，允许“翻案”。经过充分酝酿讨论，民主审查修改，最后才作为方案通过，因而社员感到满意。
    民主定案以后，进一步对社员进行集体主义教育，从搞好全社生产出发，按“居住邻近、田地连片为基础，适当照顾田地好坏、劳力强弱、技术高低、骨干分布和白田、春收田适当搭配”的原则，进行田地划片、劳动力分组。组与组间不强调绝对平均，但也注意了不使悬殊太大。某些田地不便划分，有些组就适当地多包了些，有些组就少包了些。
    包工后社员劳动积极性发挥出来了，生产效率显著提高。据初步总结：壮劳动力生产效率比包工前提高百分之三十到百分之五十；中等劳动力提高百分之二十到百分之三十；劳动力弱的人也能完成包工数，有的生产效率比包工前还稍有提高。从这方面也可看出来，经过充分讨论民主制订的定额，一般都比较准确。
    包工生产后应注意解决的三个问题
    从该社情况看，包工生产后要注意解决三个问题：
    （一）有组织、有领导地开展劳动竞赛。分组、划片包工生产后，组与组间很自然地出现了竞赛情绪，任这种情绪自流发展下去，必然会出现相互“拆台”的不团结现象。要及时抓住社员比生产的热情，进行爱国增产教育和集体主义教育，把群众劳动积极性引导到正确道路上来，有领导、有组织地开展组与组间、社员个人之间的劳动竞赛。开展劳动竞赛是发扬社员劳动积极性、提高生产效率的有效方法，务须重视领导。
    （二）定期检查评比，借以推广先进生产经验、保证不降低活路质量。短期包工虽定出了质量标准，但因没有定产，包工后往往还会发生赶工求快不重质的现象，必须在加强政治思想教育同时，建立质量检查制度，定期进行群众性的检查评比。检查评比一方面能保证活路质量不降低，另方面还能起到传播、推广先进生产经验的作用。社务委员可划分责任区，分片领导这一工作。
    （三）包工后往往因赶工图快发生累坏耕牛的现象，必须想法把耕牛的饲养管理工作做好。
