Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 19th. Zhou Enlai's six proposals made at the restricted meeting on the Indochina issue on the 16th, as revealed by the press, have been widely welcomed and valued by newspapers in Paris, London, and Geneva on the 17th.

    Paris's "Le Monde" said that Zhou Enlai's proposals on the issues of Laos and Cambodia were "considered by all participants as a major step towards an agreement." The newspaper published the full text of the proposals by Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Pham Van Dong, and said that the meeting on the 16th was a "satisfactory recovery... In any case, this meeting ruled out any tendency to adjourn."

    "L'Aurore" was headlined "Something New in Geneva - Zhou Enlai Proposes 'Remarkable' Proposals." Its Geneva correspondent wrote: The meeting on the 16th "seems to have produced commendable results."

    "France Soir" published its Geneva dispatch under the headline "Conference Has a New Start as China Proposes a Conciliatory Plan on Laos and Cambodia." The dispatch said: "Zhou Enlai's six proposals have indeed revived the Indochina conference."

    "Combat" also believes that the meeting on the 16th was a new event in Geneva. Its Geneva correspondent wrote: "The Indochina conference is still continuing, which is the result of this restricted meeting. People were worried that after this meeting, the work of the nine countries would be declared over, or at least adjourned indefinitely. However, Zhou Enlai's proposals have brought new hope that a solution is still possible."

    "Le Figaro" was headlined "The Atmosphere in Geneva Has Improved Greatly - China Proposes a Conciliatory Plan on the Issues of Laos and Cambodia at an Important Indochina Meeting."

    "Liberation" said: "If the Geneva conference on the Korean part has come to an end, the Indochina part of the conference has entered a new period due to the new proposals from China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is hoped that the difficulties caused by Bidault on the issues of Laos and Cambodia will be resolved."

    The Geneva correspondent of "L'Humanité" reported in detail the proposals of the representatives of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and wrote: "Molotov, Zhou Enlai, and Pham Van Dong gave a resounding negation to those who, on the pretext of the breakdown of the Korean issue debate, announced that the discussion of the Indochina issue would enter a dead end." The delegations of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam "made extremely effective proposals to help achieve an immediate ceasefire throughout Indochina."

    Switzerland's "Lausanne Gazette" wrote: Zhou Enlai's proposals undoubtedly brought new hope, "It can be said that after this meeting, people can no longer imagine that the Geneva conference is nearing its end."

    The "Journal de Genève" was headlined "Zhou Enlai Opens a New Door by Proposing the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops from Laos and Cambodia." The "Swiss News" was headlined "A New Beginning on the Indochina Issue at the Geneva Conference." "La Voix Ouvrière" wrote: "When the enemies of peace hoped to see the Indochina issue conference follow the path of failure like the Korean issue conference, the representative of the People's Republic of China put forward proposals that were even considered 'interesting' and 'worthy of careful study' by the French and American representatives."

    The London "Times" on the 17th carried a report from its Geneva correspondent: "The Indochina part of the Geneva conference on the afternoon of the 16th seems to have taken a welcome step forward." The newspaper's reporter reported Zhou Enlai's new proposals under the headline "A Progress in Geneva." The conservative "Daily Telegraph" valued the off-site talks between Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and Foreign Secretary Eden before the meeting on the 16th, considering it a "serious and important" effort, and said that "the most important development" at the meeting on the 16th "was Zhou Enlai's speech." The headline of the "Daily Express" about the news of the meeting on the 16th was: "Mr. Zhou Enlai of China Raised Hopes for the Geneva Conference."

    The London "Daily Herald" wrote on the 17th: "There is more hope for the Indochina conference. At the secret meeting, Foreign Minister Zhou delivered a long speech that the French described as 'a step forward.'"

    The "Manchester Guardian" wrote under the large headline on the front page, "China's New Conciliatory Attitude on the Indochina Issue": "The negotiations on Indochina have new life when Mr. Zhou Enlai came up with a proposal that non-communist countries considered to be moderate and reasonable."

    The London "Daily Worker" wrote on the 17th: "The threat of the West to undermine the Indochina ceasefire negotiations after destroying the Korean talks has failed. After Foreign Ministers Molotov and Zhou Enlai put forward new and important proposals, it has been decided to hold another secret meeting at the foreign minister level on Friday."

    【新华社日内瓦十九日电】报界所透露的周恩来外长在十六日印度支那问题限制性会议上所作的六点建议，受到十七日巴黎、伦敦以及日内瓦报纸的普遍欢迎和重视。
    巴黎“世界报”说，对周恩来外长关于老挝、柬埔寨问题的建议，“所有与会者都认为是走向协议途上的一大步”。这家报纸登载了周外长和范文同副总理的建议全文，并说十六日的会议是“令人满意的复苏……无论如何，这次会议排斥了任何休会的倾向”。

    “战斗报”也认为十六日会议是日内瓦的新的事件。它的驻日内瓦记者写道：“印度支那的会议仍在继续，这是这次限制性会议的结果。人们曾担忧这次会后就要宣布九国的工作宣告结束，或至少是无限期休会。可是，周恩来的建议却带来了解决仍有可能的新的希望。”
    “费加罗报”的标题为“日内瓦的气氛大大改善——印度支那重要会议中国提出关于老挝和柬埔寨问题的和解性计划”。
    “解放报”说：“如果日内瓦会议关于朝鲜部分已告结束的话，会议的印度支那部分则由于中国和越南民主共和国的新建议已进入一个新时期。可望看到皮杜尔就老挝和柬埔寨问题所引起的困难将得到解决。”
    “人道报”的日内瓦记者详尽地报道了中、苏和越南民主共和国代表的建议，并写道：“莫洛托夫、周恩来和范文同给那些借口朝鲜问题辩论破裂从而宣布印度支那问题讨论将进入死胡同的人们一个响亮的否定。”苏、中、越三国代表团“作了有助于在印度支那全境立即实现停火的极为有效的建议”。
    瑞士“洛桑日报”写道：周恩来的建议无疑地带来了新的希望，“可以说在这次会议后，人们不能再设想日内瓦会议已近黄昏”。
    “日内瓦日报”的标题为“由于建议外国军队从老挝和柬埔寨撤退，周恩来开了一个新的门”。“瑞士报”的标题为“在日内瓦会议上印度支那问题新的开始”。“工人之声报”写道：“当和平的敌人希望看到印度支那问题会议和朝鲜问题会议一样走上失败的道路的时候，中华人民共和国的代表提出了甚至被法、美代表都认为是‘有兴趣’和
  ‘值得慎重研究’的建议。”
    十七日伦敦“泰晤士报”载驻日内瓦记者的报道：“十六日下午的印度支那部分的日内瓦会议，似乎向前走了值得欢迎的一步。”这个报纸的记者在
  “在日内瓦的一个进展”的标题下报道了周恩来外长的新建议。保守党“每日电讯报”重视十六日会前周恩来外长和艾登外交大臣的会外谈话，认为这是“认真而重要的”努力，并说十六日会上“最重要的发展是周恩来的演说”。“每日快报”关于十六日会议消息的标题是：“中国的周恩来先生提高了日内瓦会议的希望”。
    伦敦“每日先驱报”十七日写道：“印度支那会议有了更多的希望，在秘密会议上，周外长发表了一个被法国人描述为‘前进一步’的长篇演讲。”
    “曼彻斯特卫报”在首页大字标题“中国对印度支那问题新的和解态度”之下写道：“当周恩来先生拿出了一个被非共产主义国家认为是温和合理的建议时，印度支那的谈判有了新的生命。”
    伦敦“工人日报”十七日写道：“西方在破坏朝鲜会谈之后还想破坏印度支那停火谈判的威胁失败了。在莫洛托夫和周恩来外长提出新的重要的建议之后，已经决定在星期五再举行另一次外长级的秘密会议。”
