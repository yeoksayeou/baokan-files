(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th) The 11th All-Soviet Trade Union Congress continued its session on June 8th in the Moscow Kremlin, discussing the summary reports of the All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Auditing Commission.

Those who spoke during the discussion included leading cadres of Soviet trade unions, trade union workers, and advanced workers. They spoke of the achievements of the Soviet working class in developing various sectors of the national economy and the happy life of Soviet workers, as well as the achievements and experiences of Soviet trade union organizations in continuously improving the cultural and technical level of workers. They also put forward many valuable suggestions for further improving trade union work.

Rossochinsky, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Miners' Union, reported on the production achievements of the Soviet coal industry and the happy life of the miners. He said that in 1953, the Soviet Union mined 320 million tons of coal, twice as much as in 1940. In the past three years, nearly 1 billion rubles have been spent solely on improving the working conditions of miners. During the same period, more than 200,000 houses were built for coal miners, and 1,600 cultural and social service institutions were established. There are now about 700 cultural palaces and clubs, more than 1,000 libraries, 60 well-equipped sports grounds, more than 300 gymnasiums, and skating rinks for miners and their families.

Yefanov, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Steelworkers' Union, pointed out in his speech on the labor achievements of the Soviet steelworkers that the latest equipment and technology have been widely adopted in various Soviet iron and steel industry enterprises, and the production process has been automated and mechanized. In 1953, the utilization of the effective volume of blast furnaces increased by 19.5 percent. Steel production per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area increased by 31.9 percent. Due to production achievements, in the past five years alone, more than 76,000 workers, engineers, technicians, and other staff members in the ferrous metal industry sector have been awarded various orders and medals of the Soviet Union.

Maksimov, Chairman of the Factory Committee of the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky, spoke about the continuous improvement of the cultural and technical level of the factory's workers. He said that 60 percent of the workers in the factory now have an education level of 7th to 10th grade. The cultural and technical knowledge of many workers is approaching the level of engineers and technicians. From the 10th All-Soviet Trade Union Congress to this one, the factory's employees have put forward a total of 100,007 rationalization proposals. The economic value of these rationalization proposals amounts to more than 268 million rubles.
