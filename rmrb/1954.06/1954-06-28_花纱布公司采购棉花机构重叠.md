    Overlapping Cotton Procurement Organizations in China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Corporation
    Wang Shoulun from the Yuncheng Procurement and Supply Wholesale Station of the Shanxi Provincial Company of the China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Corporation writes: There is a phenomenon of overlapping organizations in the grassroots units under the China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Corporation. The cotton procurement organizations of the various national cotton yarn cloth companies are scattered throughout every cotton-producing area and along transportation lines leading to textile industrial regions. For example, our wholesale station is responsible for the cotton procurement and transfer work of seventeen counties in the Yuncheng Special District. More than 60 percent of the cotton is concentrated on the Longhai Railway and transferred to textile areas in East and Central South China. Therefore, in addition to setting up receiving and transporting organizations on the Tongpu Railway within Shanxi Province, we have also set up three receiving groups in Tongguan, Lingbao, and Shanzhou, with more than 70 cadres and guards responsible for receiving and transporting cotton, requiring a monthly expenditure of 42.52 million yuan in wages and expenses. However, in these three places, the Henan and Shaanxi cotton yarn cloth companies also have cotton purchasing organizations. Last year, we spent 1 billion yuan in Tongguan to build a freight yard covering an area of 50 mu, while the Tongguan cotton yarn cloth company also has a freight yard of almost the same size, which is often not fully utilized. If we eliminate our organizations in these three places and increase the local companies by one-third of our existing cadres and guards, they can undertake our receiving and transportation tasks (cotton can be settled at a price). In this way, transportation procedures can be unified, and the state can save several hundred million yuan in wages and other expenses each year. We hope that the China National Cotton Yarn Cloth Corporation will consider resolving this issue.

### 花纱布公司采购棉花机构重叠

    花纱布公司采购棉花机构重叠
    中国花纱布公司山西省公司运城采购供应批发站王守伦来信：花纱布公司所属的基层单位有机构重叠的现象。全国各花纱布公司的采购棉花机构遍布每一个棉产区和通往纺织工业地区的交通线上。如我们这个批发站，担任着运城专区十七个县的棉花采购调运工作，棉花的百分之六十以上是集中在陇海路上调往华东和中南各纺织区的。因此我们除在山西省内同蒲线上设有接运机构，并且在潼关、灵宝、陕州三地设了三个接运组，由七十多个干部和警卫人员负责接运棉花工作，每月需开支工薪经费四千二百五十二万元。但在这三个地方，河南、陕西的花纱布公司也同样设有收购棉花的机构。我们去年在潼关用款十亿修建一个占地五十亩的货场，而潼关花纱布公司也有差不多那么大的一个货场却经常放不满。如果将我们在这三地的机构取消，给当地公司增加上我们现有干部和警卫人员的三分之一，他们就可以承办我们的接运任务（棉花可作价结算）。这样，既可以使运输手续统一，每年又能给国家节省数亿元的工薪经费等开支。希望中国花纱布公司考虑解决这个问题。
