In international affairs, the United States has always shown great "concern" for the internal affairs of other countries. This can be clearly seen from the recent American reaction to the French cabinet crisis. When the French National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the Laniel government last time (May 13), Washington officials and members of Congress "were pleased" that Laniel had barely avoided being overthrown, even though the Laniel government had only received two more votes of confidence (Reuters). But this time, when the Laniel government finally failed to gain the trust of the National Assembly and collapsed, it immediately "caused anxiety in the United States" (United Press).

What is the reason for the United States' "concern" about the changes in the French political situation? According to Reuters, the United States "was pleased" last time because it felt that Bidault could continue to implement a foreign policy consistent with the United States. And this time, the reason for the "anxiety," according to the Associated Press, is that the new government "will weaken the Western position in Asia and may also weaken the position in Europe," especially because the French cabinet crisis may affect Dulles' plan to take "united action" in Southeast Asia. The Associated Press also said that Mendes-France, who was appointed to organize the new government, openly expressed "the determination to quickly negotiate peace in Indochina, which may dispel any hope of the Allied countries (that is, the United States' puppet states) to intervene in the three Indochinese countries," and his "open opposition to the European Army Treaty also aroused the concern (!) of American officials." In a word, the "pleasure" or "anxiety" of the United States depends on whether the French government can implement the policy of following the United States in expanding the Indochina War, and whether it can quickly approve the European Army Treaty that violates the interests of the French people.

In fact, officials and members of Congress in Washington are not only "anxious" this time, but have also used means of threats and inducements against France. U.S. Senator Knowland openly clamored on June 12 that if the new French government changes its current policy, then the United States will ask the puppet regime in Indochina to immediately "declare independence"; in addition, according to a United Press dispatch from New York on June 15, Eisenhower has stated that "he requires Congress to temporarily suspend all military aid to France and Italy until they approve the European Defense Group." People can clearly hear the sound of American whips and dollars here!

The United States does not allow the new French government to choose any path that changes its current policy. However, those responsible for organizing the new French government cannot but consider whether to listen to the voice of the people or the voice of American whips and dollars? The Laniel government, which only listened to the sound of American whips and dollars, has already collapsed. If it continues to follow Laniel's old path, it will never have a better fate than Laniel.

    美国鞭子和金元的声音
    江东
    在国际事务中，美国一向表现对别国内政十分“关心”。这从近来美国对法国内阁危机的反应上可以看得很清楚。在上次（五月十三日）法国国民议会对拉尼埃政府举行信任投票时，华盛顿的官员和国会人士曾因拉尼埃侥幸没有垮台“感到愉快”，虽然拉尼埃政府不过是仅仅多得了两张信任票而已（路透社）。而这次拉尼埃政府终于没有得到国民议会的信任垮台了，却立即“引起了美国的不安”（合众社）。
    是什么原因使美国这样“关心”法国政局的变化呢？据路透社说，美国对上次所以“感到愉快”，是觉得那样皮杜尔就可以继续执行和美国一致的外交政策了。而这次所以“不安”，据美联社说，是因为新政府“将削弱西方在亚洲的地位，也可能削弱在欧洲的地位”，特别是因为法国的内阁危机可能影响杜勒斯提出的在东南亚采取“联合行动”的计划。美联社并且说，被任命组织新政府的孟戴斯—弗朗斯公开表示“迅速谈判印度支那和平的决心，可能打消盟国（就是美国的仆从国家）对三个印度支那国家进行干涉的任何希望”，他“公开表示反对欧洲军条约一节，也引起了美国官员们的关怀（！）”。一句话，美国的“愉快”或“不安”是要看法国政府能否执行追随美国扩大印度支那战争的政策，能否很快批准违反法国人民利益的欧洲军条约。
    实际上，这次华盛顿的官员和国会人士不仅“不安”，而且已经施展对法国的威胁利诱手段了。美国参议员诺兰在六月十二日公开叫嚣，如果法国新政府改变现行政策，那末美国要叫印度支那的傀儡政权立即“宣布独立”；另外据合众社纽约六月十五日电讯透露：艾森豪威尔已表示，“他要求国会暂时停止给法国和意大利一切军事援助，直到它们批准欧洲防务集团时为止。”人们从这里可以很清楚地听到美国鞭子和金元的声音了！
    美国是不许法国新政府选择任何改变现行政策的道路的。然而，负责组织法国新政府的人却不能不考虑，应该听人民的声音呢，还是听美国鞭子和金元的声音？只听美国鞭子和金元声音拉尼埃政府已经垮台了，如果还要沿着拉尼埃的老路走去，就决不可能有比拉尼埃更好的命运。
