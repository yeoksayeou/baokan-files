    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency: The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communique stating that in the half-month period up to June 16th, the Vietnam People's Army annihilated a total of 3,800 enemy troops in various parts of Vietnam, removed and forced the enemy to withdraw from more than 50 strongholds, thereby expanding the guerrilla areas.
    The communique stated that in North Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army removed the enemy's stronghold of Dong Bien in Hai Hau District, Nam Dinh Province, annihilating 900 enemy troops. As a result, the entire Hai Hau District was liberated, giving a heavy blow to the enemy's conspiracy to occupy the southern region of Nam Dinh Province.
    At the same time, the People's Army annihilated most of an enemy battalion and another 100 troops in two ambushes in Hung Yen Province and Ninh Binh Province. The People's Army also inflicted heavy losses on the enemy troops "sweeping" in Son Tay Province and Bac Ninh Province.
    In addition, the People's Army removed eight enemy strongholds in Vinh Phuc, Ha Dong, Ninh Binh, Thai Binh, Hung Yen, and Kien An provinces, and forced the enemy to withdraw from twenty-five strongholds. The guerrilla areas in these provinces were thus expanded.
    In Central and South Vietnam, the People's Army also dealt heavy blows to the enemy, removing many strongholds. The People's Armed Forces also burned down a large French military arsenal in Phu Tho, near Saigon, containing supplies for French forces in Indochina.
   Xinhua News Agency, June 20th: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency on June 19th: The Vietnam People's Army shot down an enemy B-26 bomber in Phu Binh District, Thai Nguyen Province, North Vietnam, on the 17th. According to preliminary reports, three enemy personnel on board were killed.
    Xinhua News Agency, June 21st: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency on June 20th: The enemy troops in Viet Tri City, Phu Tho Province, North Vietnam, were forced to retreat on the 16th. On the afternoon of the same day, the local forces and guerrillas of the Vietnam People's Army in the Viet Tri area, together with representatives of the Phu Tho Provincial Resistance Administrative Committee, entered Viet Tri City.
    Viet Tri is an important strategic stronghold, located at the confluence of the Red River and the Lo River. It is the center of many important land and water transportation routes. The waterways from Hanoi to Yen Bai and from Tuyen Quang to Hoa Binh, and the land routes from Haiphong, Hanoi to Lao Cai all pass through Viet Tri. For several years, Viet Tri has repeatedly become a springboard for the enemy's offensive against the Viet Bac base area.

    北越富寿省越池城的敌军被迫撤退
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部发表公报说：越南人民军在到六月十六日为止的半个多月中，在越南各地共歼灭敌军三千八百名，拔除和迫使敌军撤出了五十多个据点，从而扩大了游击区。
    公报说：在北越，越南人民军拔除了南定省海后县的敌军据点东边，歼灭敌军九百名，因此，整个海后县解放了，这给予敌军企图占领南定省南部地区的阴谋一个沉重的打击。
    同时，人民军在兴安省和宁平省的两次截击战中，歼灭敌军一个营的大部又一百人。人民军并使在山西省和北宁省“扫荡”的敌军遭受重大损失。
    此外，人民军在永福、河东、宁平、太平、兴安、建安等省拔除了敌军据点八处，并迫使敌军自二十五个据点撤退。这些省的游击区因而扩大了。
    在中越和南越，人民军也给予敌军以沉重打击，拔除据点多处。人民武装并在西贡附近的富寿烧毁法军在印度支那的一座大军火库。
   【新华社二十日讯】据越南通讯社十九日讯：越南人民军十七日在北越太原省富平县击落敌军B—二十六型轰炸机一架。据初步消息，飞机上的敌军人员三名毙命。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：北越富寿省越池城的敌军被迫在十六日撤退。同日下午，越池地区的越南人民军地方部队和游击队，会同富寿省抗战行政委员会代表进入越池城。
    越池是一重要战略据点，它位于红河和泸江的会合处，它是许多重要水陆交通线的中心点，从河内到安沛，从宣光到和平的水路，自海防、河内到老街的陆路都经过越池。几年来，越池曾多次成为敌人进攻越北根据地的跳板。
