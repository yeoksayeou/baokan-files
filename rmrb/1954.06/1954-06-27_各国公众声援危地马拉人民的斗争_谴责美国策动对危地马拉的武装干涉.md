Public Support from Various Countries for the Struggle of the Guatemalan People
Condemnation of the US-Orchestrated Armed Intervention in Guatemala
International Democratic Women's Federation
The International Democratic Women's Federation issued a letter to the women of the world on June 25th, calling on them to fully support the Guatemalan people's struggle against aggression and for national independence.
	The letter to the women of the world said: The International Democratic Women's Federation condemns before all women of the world the brutal act of aggression launched against Guatemala, the purpose of which is to overthrow the legitimate government of Guatemala by force. Guatemalan cities are being bombed, and women and children are suffering.
	The organizations of the International Democratic Women's Federation have always been watching the preparations for aggression with unease. The military treaty concluded between the United States and Honduras has further intensified this action.
	The aggression against Guatemala shows that the warmongering forces, disregarding the peace aspirations of the people of the world, are attempting to use violence to force others to accept their will and further intensify the international situation.
	The aggressors intend to hinder the achievements of the Guatemalan people for the benefit of the United Fruit Company. The United Fruit Company is a large monopoly capital that controls the economy of Central American countries, and it cannot tolerate Guatemala breaking away from its control.
	The International Democratic Women's Federation angrily protests this aggression and expresses its respect to the heroic struggle of Guatemalan women for the independence of their country. The International Democratic Women's Federation assures them of the deepest and most enthusiastic support of the millions of women it represents. It calls on women all over the world to express their support for the Guatemalan women's struggle for national independence and to provide strong assistance.
	The International Democratic Women's Federation suggests that women of all countries ask their governments to condemn this aggression, to suggest that the United Nations Security Council take action to stop the United States from continuing to support the aggression, and to ask them to abide by the Security Council's ceasefire order.
	The International Democratic Women's Federation especially calls on the women of Latin American countries to support the powerful struggle of their Guatemalan sisters. Their maintenance of their own country's sovereignty is the maintenance of the sovereignty of all Latin American countries.
	The International Democratic Women's Federation believes that the powerful actions of peace forces around the world will once again defeat the conspiracies of those who attempt to establish new centers of war.

	United States
	The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press, signed by William Foster, Elizabeth Flynn, and Pettis Perry, condemning "the United Fruit Company's mercenaries' barbaric aggression against democratic Guatemala, which is not only a crime against the Guatemalan people but also against the American people and all mankind."
	The National Committee pointed out in the statement that there is widespread opposition throughout Latin America to the war-mongering policy pursued by US imperialism, and the statement denounced the State Department's lies that the Guatemalan incident was a "Guatemalan uprising." The National Committee pointed out that the US government, acting in the interests of the United Fruit Company, is trying to replace the democratically elected government with "such puppet autocratic regimes as are imposed on the people of Nicaragua, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and other Latin American countries." "This is part of the US government's 'liberation' policy, which is to create war or rebellion against every government that refuses to obey the US State Department."
	The National Committee called on the patriotic people of the United States to demand that the United Nations Security Council implement its resolution requiring a halt to any action that might cause bloodshed, and to demand that the White House prohibit the shipment of all weapons to the aggressors in order to implement this resolution.
	The National Committee's statement concluded with the following slogans:
  "Stop the United Fruit Company's war against Guatemala! No war between Americans! No intervention in Guatemala!"

	Latin America
	According to a United Press report, the Peruvian Socialist Party issued a statement condemning "imperialist armed forces" for invading Guatemala. A rally was held in the building of the National University in Havana (Cuba), and the participants protested against the policies of the United States.
	According to a report from Mexico City by a reporter for the American "Workers' Daily," Mexican Minister of National Defense Sanchez Hernandez said that Mexico will never allow any group intending to invade Guatemala to pass through Mexican territory.
	The news also said that the Mexican Youth League expressed its solidarity with Guatemala, and participants in the conference of the Schools of Law and Medicine and students from the University of Mexico City unanimously protested against the interference in and invasion of Guatemala.

	East Germany
	In the German Democratic Republic, the German Democratic Women's Federation, in a telegram to the Democratic Women's Federation of Guatemala, condemned the US interference in Guatemala's internal affairs and the bombing of peaceful Guatemalan residents. The peace organizations of the Magdeburg administrative region and organizations in some enterprises, as well as employees, also denounced the US monopoly capitalists' planned aggression against Guatemala and issued statements supporting the Guatemalan people.

	Indonesia
	The Indonesian working people also protested against the armed intervention in Guatemala. The leading body of the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor, representing 2.5 million members, sent a telegram to Eisenhower and the United Nations, expressing indignation at the US aggression. In the telegram to the United Nations, it said: "The Indonesian working people condemn the invasion of Guatemala and demand immediate steps to stop the intervention and guarantee Guatemala's national sovereignty." At the same time, the Indonesian General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the Guatemalan government, expressing solidarity with the Guatemalan people.

	United Kingdom
	Five student groups at the London School of Economics passed a resolution calling on the United Nations to try to achieve a ceasefire in Guatemala and to immediately send a committee to investigate the invasion of Guatemalan territory. The British magazine "New Statesman and Nation" condemned the aggression against Guatemala in an editorial. The magazine also accused the United States of encouraging this aggression.

	West Germany
	West German newspapers "Westfälische Rundschau" and "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" condemned the US-orchestrated aggression against Guatemala. The two newspapers pointed out that the reason why the United States is dissatisfied with the Guatemalan government's policies is that the government has implemented reforms that do not suit the taste of "American monopoly capital."

    各国公众声援危地马拉人民的斗争
    谴责美国策动对危地马拉的武装干涉
    国际民主妇联
    国际民主妇女联合会六月二十五日发表告世界妇女书，要求她们全力支持危地马拉人民反对侵略、争取民族独立的斗争。
    告世界妇女书说：国际民主妇联在全世界妇女之前谴责向危地马拉发动的残酷的侵略行动，这种行动的目的是想要用武力推翻危地马拉的合法政府。危地马拉的城市被轰炸，妇女和儿童遭了殃。
    国际民主妇联各组织一向不安地注视着侵略的准备行动，美国和洪都拉斯政府缔结的军事条约，使得这种行动进一步加紧了。
    向危地马拉发动的侵略说明，好战势力不顾全世界人民的和平愿望，企图借助暴力来强迫别人接受它的意旨并且使国际局势更加紧张。
    侵略者打算为了联合果品公司的利益，阻碍危地马拉人民所取得的成就。联合果品公司是一个控制着中美洲国家经济的大垄断资本，它不能容忍危地马拉摆脱它的控制。
    国际民主妇联愤怒地抗议这种侵略，并向危地马拉妇女争取她们国家独立的英勇斗争表示敬意。国际民主妇联保证它所代表的千百万妇女给她们以最深切的和最热烈的支援。它号召全世界妇女对危地马拉妇女争取民族独立的斗争表示支援，并给以有力的帮助。
    国际民主妇联建议各国妇女要求她们本国政府谴责这次侵略，要求它们建议联合国安全理事会采取行动以制止美国继续支持侵略，并要它们遵守安理会的停火命令。
    国际民主妇联特别号召拉丁美洲国家妇女支持她们的危地马拉姊妹们的有力的斗争，她们维护她们自己国家的主权，就是在维护着所有拉丁美洲国家的主权。
    国际民主妇联表示相信：全世界和平力量的有力行动会再一次击败那些企图建立新的战争中心的人的阴谋。
      美国
    美国共产党全国委员会向报界发表了一项由威廉·福斯特、伊丽莎白·弗林和佩蒂斯·佩里签署的声明，谴责“联合果品公司的雇佣军对民主危地马拉进行野蛮的侵略，这不仅是对危地马拉人民的罪行，也是对美洲人民与全人类的罪行”。
    全国委员会在声明中指出拉丁美洲各地广泛反对美帝国主义奉行的发动战争的政策，声明斥责国务院所谓危地马拉事件是“危地马拉人的起义”的谰言。全国委员会指出，根据联合果品公司的利益行事的美国政府力图以“强加于尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯、多米尼加共和国、委内瑞拉与其他拉丁美洲国家人民的那样的傀儡专制政体”来代替以民主方式选出的政府，“这是美国政府的‘解放’政策的一部分，这个政策就是制造战争或叛乱来对付每一个拒绝听命于美国国务院的政府。”
    全国委员会号召美国爱国人民要求联合国安全理事会贯彻它的要求停止任何可能引起流血的行动的决议，并要求白宫禁止以一切武器运给侵略者以执行这个决议。
    全国委员会的声明在结束时提出了下列口号：
  “制止联合果品公司对危地马拉进行的战争！美洲人之间不要进行战争！不要干涉危地马拉！”
      拉丁美洲
    据合众社报道，秘鲁社会党发表声明，谴责
  “帝国主义武装力量”侵犯危地马拉。在哈瓦那
  （古巴）的国立大学的大厦里举行了集会，与会者对美国的政策表示抗议。
    据美国“工人日报”记者自墨西哥城报道，墨西哥国防部部长桑切思·埃南德斯说，墨西哥决不许可打算侵犯危地马拉的任何集团通过墨西哥的领土。
    消息中还说，墨西哥青年联盟对危地马拉表示声援，法律和医学专科学校学生大会的与会者和墨西哥城大学的学生，对干涉者侵犯危地马拉的事情都一致表示抗议。
    民主德国
    在德意志民主共和国，德国民主妇女联合会在致危地马拉民主妇女联合会的电报中，谴责美国干涉危地马拉内政和轰炸危地马拉和平居民。马格德堡行政区的和平组织和一些企业中的组织以及员工们，也斥责美国垄断资本家所策划的对危地马拉的侵略，并发表声明支持危地马拉人民。
      印　尼
    印度尼西亚劳动人民也抗议武装干涉危地马拉。印尼总工会的领导机构代表二百五十万会员，致电艾森豪威尔和联合国，对于美国的侵略行为表示愤慨，在给联合国的电报中说：“印尼劳动人民谴责对危地马拉的侵犯，要求立即采取步骤，停止干涉，并保证危地马拉的国家主权。”印尼总工会同时致电危地马拉政府，表示与危地马拉人民团结一致。
    英　国
    伦敦经济学院的五个学生团体通过一项决议，要求联合国设法在危地马拉停火，并立即派遣一个委员会，调查对于危地马拉领土的侵犯。英国杂志“新政治家与民族”在社论中谴责对危地马拉所进行的侵略行为。杂志并指责美国鼓励这一侵略。
    西　德
    西德报纸“威斯特伐利亚评论”和“法兰克福寰球报”谴责了美国所策划的对危地马拉的侵略。这两家报纸指出，美国对危地马拉政府的政策不满意的原因是，这个政府实行了各项不合“美国垄断资本”的口味的改革。　（据新华社讯）
