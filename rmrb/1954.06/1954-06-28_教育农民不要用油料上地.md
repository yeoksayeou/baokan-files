    Educate Farmers Not to Use Oil Crops as Fertilizer

    Kou Qintian from the Agricultural Department of the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry writes: This year, the country is calling on farmers to increase the production of oil crops as much as possible without affecting the increase in grain and cotton production, in order to meet the growing needs of the people. However, in the economic crop producing areas of Henan Province, there are still many farmers who use oil crops such as cottonseed, sesame, and black beans as fertilizer. According to my understanding in Dengfeng County, a major cotton-producing area, farmers Shi Kang, Shi Wanshun, Shi Baoshan, and others in Chenyao Village, Chenyao Township, steam, fry, and crush cottonseed before applying it to sweet potato or cotton fields. Feng Yan of Xiao?? Village fried a large basket of cottonseed and applied it whole to his sweet potato field; Feng Taimao also used 54 jin of black beans on two mu of sweet potato land.

    Why don't the farmers in these areas sell cottonseed and other oil crops to the cooperative and then buy cake fertilizer for application? There are two reasons: First, the cooperative's supply of cake fertilizer is insufficient, and the price is unreasonable. After farmers sold their grain to the state last winter, everyone wanted to buy cake fertilizer for application, which made cake fertilizer even more scarce. At the same time, for a period after the Spring Festival, the prices of cottonseed and cottonseed cake were set unreasonably: cottonseed was 450 yuan per jin, while cottonseed cake was 400 yuan, so farmers felt it was more cost-effective to use cottonseed as fertilizer. Second, the local people have a habit of using cottonseed, believing that cottonseed is more effective than cake fertilizer.

    Using oil crops as fertilizer not only reduces the source of edible oil, but is also not beneficial to crops. Because cottonseed, sesame, black beans, etc., contain very rich oil content, and the components of oil are three elements: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Crops can fully obtain these three elements from water and air, and do not need to absorb them from oil crops; moreover, the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in oil are organic compounds and cannot be absorbed and utilized by crops. On the contrary, if the fertilizer contains more oil, it will hinder the activity of bacteria, affect the decomposition of fertilizer, and thus reduce or delay the fertilizer effect. According to fertilizer effect tests conducted by the North China Agricultural Science Institute, oil cake is more effective than oil crops: taking corn planting as an example, applying 8 jin of oil per mu can produce 483 jin of corn; applying 121 jin of black beans can produce 614 jin of corn; applying 111 jin of soybean cake can produce 632 jin of corn. It can be seen that applying oil cake that has been squeezed for oil to the land will yield more grain than using oil crops. If oil cake can be used to feed livestock first, and then the livestock manure can be used as fertilizer, even more grain can be produced.

    As long as we explain to the farmers the principle that applying oil cake to the land can produce more grain, and actively do a good job in supplying oil cake, the habit of farmers using oil crops as fertilizer can be changed. It is hoped that the Henan Provincial Cooperative, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the people's governments in relevant areas will pay attention to this issue together.

    Editor's Note: It is understood that the habit of using oil crops as fertilizer has not only long existed in the economic crop areas of Henan Province, but is also quite common in Shandong, Shanxi and many other regions. For example, in Buzhuang Village, District 1, Dong'a County, Shandong Province, more than 20 percent of the 521 mu of winter wheat that used basal fertilizer last autumn used soybeans. According to incomplete statistics from Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, in 1953, farmers in the county used a total of 3.8 million jin of black beans as fertilizer. If these black beans were used to extract oil, 400,000 jin of soybean oil could be extracted. This is a great waste. It is hoped that the people's governments in areas with similar phenomena will pay attention to this issue and take active and effective measures to educate farmers to change this unscientific habit.

### 教育农民不要用油料上地

专栏：读者来信摘要

    教育农民不要用油料上地
    河南省农林厅农业处寇勤田来信：今年，国家号召农民在不影响粮棉增产的情况下尽量增产油料作物，以满足人民日益增长的需要。但是，河南省各经济作物产区仍有不少农民用棉籽、芝麻、黑豆等油料上地（作肥料用）。据我在盛产棉花的登封县了解，陈瑶乡陈瑶村农民时康、时万顺、时宝善等都把棉籽蒸蒸炒炒碾碎以后上了红薯地或棉花地。小??村冯炎把一大篮棉籽炒炒囫囵着就上到了红薯地里；冯太茂也用五十四斤黑豆上了二亩红薯地。
    为什么这些地区的农民不把棉籽等油料卖给合作社，然后再买饼肥上地呢？原因有两个：第一是合作社饼肥供应不上，而且价格不合理。去冬农民把粮食卖给国家以后，大家都想买饼肥上地，因而饼肥更感不足。同时春节后有一段时期棉籽与棉饼的价格订得不合理：棉籽每斤四百五十元，棉饼四百元，农民感到还不如用棉籽上地合算。第二是当地群众有上棉籽的习惯，认为棉籽上地比棉饼壮。
    用油料上地，不但减少了食油的来源，而且对农作物也是没有好处的。因为棉籽、芝麻、黑豆等含有很丰富的油分，油的成份是碳、氢、氧三种元素。农作物可以从水和空气里充分取得这三种元素，不需要再从油料中来吸收；而且油中的碳、氢、氧是有机化合物，不能被庄稼吸收利用。相反地，如果肥料中含有较多的油分，就会妨碍细菌的活动，影响肥料的分解，因而降低或推迟了肥效。根据华北农业科学研究所肥效试验证明，油饼肥效比油料要高：以种玉米为例，每亩如施油八斤，可产玉米四百八十三斤；施黑豆一百二十一斤，可产玉米六百一十四斤；施豆饼一百一十一斤，可产玉米六百三十二斤。由此可见，用榨过油的油饼上地要比用油料上地多收粮食。如果能先用油饼喂牲畜，然后再用牲畜的粪便作肥料，还可以增产更多的粮食。
    我们只要向农民说清油饼上地能多收粮食的道理，并积极做好油饼供应工作，农民用油料上地的习惯是可以改变的。希望河南省合作社、河南省农林厅和有关地区的人民政府共同注意这个问题。
    编者按：据了解，用油料上地的习惯，不但在河南省各经济作物区长期存在，而且在山东、山西等其它不少地区也是相当普遍的。如山东省东阿县一区卜庄村去年秋小麦施用基肥五百二十一亩，其中百分之二十以上使用的是大豆。据山西省武乡县不完全的统计，一九五三年全县农民共使用三百八十万斤黑豆作肥料，如果用这些黑豆榨油，可以榨豆油四十万斤。这是一个很大的浪费。希望有类似现象地区的人民政府重视这个问题，采取积极有效的办法来教育农民改变这种不科学的习惯。
