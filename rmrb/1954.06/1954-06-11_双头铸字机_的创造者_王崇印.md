The Youth League Northwest District Directly Subordinate Organs Committee held an award ceremony in Xi'an on April 17th this year, with 900 Youth League members and young people participating. They awarded an honorary certificate to Wang Chongyin, a young worker at the Northwest Xinzhong Printing Factory and an alternate member of the Chinese Communist Party, for creating the "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine."

The electric type-casting machine currently used in China's printing industry has only one casting head. Each time a type mold is changed, it takes at least fifteen seconds, and only about 2,300 characters can be cast per hour. Wang Chongyin's "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" has two heads. While one head is casting characters, the other head can change type molds. Each mold change takes only one second, and over 3,000 characters can be cast per hour, increasing casting efficiency by 30%. The "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" has a simple structure and low cost. Some type-casting machines require three transfers to cast a lead character, while the "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" can do it in one. Because the "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" reduces many complex and unnecessary parts, the cost per unit is only 23 million yuan, while producing a "Wan Nian Type-Casting Machine" costs more than 32 million yuan. In addition, the "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" has a large lead pot, a high melting lead capacity, and sufficient pressure, resulting in very solid characters.

The creator of the "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine," Wang Chongyin, is only twenty years old this year; he was only eighteen years old when he successfully created the machine.

Wang Chongyin is from Luochuan County, Shaanxi Province. At sixteen, after graduating from elementary school, he entered the Northwest Xinzhong Printing Factory. When he was in elementary school, he loved labor courses and was especially happy when he saw machines. After being assigned to work in the type-casting group, he studied technology with great enthusiasm. In less than half a year, he mastered type-casting techniques, and his type-casting efficiency exceeded that of ordinary apprentices, earning him praise from his superiors. Because Wang Chongyin was still very young at this time, he gradually became proud.

The Party and Youth League organizations discovered this problem and talked to Wang Chongyin, and also led the workers in the type-casting group to hold four or five meetings. Wang Chongyin recalled the situation at the time, saying: "Thanks to everyone for pointing out my problems in time and helping me to correct my work attitude, otherwise, relying solely on my love for machines, the double-headed type-casting machine could not have been created."

When he realized the meaning of his work, his interests and work needs became combined. He often thought about how to improve production efficiency and overfulfill production tasks by improving mechanical equipment and operating methods. At one time, everyone believed that the speed of type-casting could not be increased any further, and any faster would affect the quality of the lead characters. Wang Chongyin doubted this statement. He carefully studied the operating methods and found that in order for the lead to solidify, workers had to press the handle down and pause, and then pull it up and pause again when casting characters. In fact, when the handle was pressed down, the lead character had already solidified, and there was no need to pause when pulling it up. At his suggestion, one procedure was reduced, and type-casting efficiency doubled.

Next, Wang Chongyin discovered that the characters cast by the hand-cranked type-casting machine had to go through complex processes such as ramming, grinding, planing, and trimming. In particular, grinding the characters required holding them by hand and grinding them on a steel file. Every day, workers would break their fingers, affecting their health and the completion of production tasks. Wang Chongyin thought about this day and night. One worker said, "Can't we use the universal type-casting machine to cast these large-sized characters?" This sentence immediately reminded Wang Chongyin. He thought that although the universal type-casting machine could not cast these large-sized characters, could he not create a character-grinding machine by imitating its character output process? (The universal type-casting machine has grinding, planing and other equipment.) Since then, his research work began. When he was making the model of the grinding and planing machine, he found that the character output process of the universal type-casting machine was swinging, which often caused problems. Later, he changed the character output process a bit, but because the model was not well made, some parts could not turn when assembled. Encountering this setback, he no longer wanted to do it. The factory director saw that he was not in high spirits and said to him: "Take your time, discuss with everyone more, learn from heroic models, think of more ways, and don't be afraid of difficulties." Wang Chongyin listened to the factory director's words and couldn't sleep at night. He thought of the achievements of many heroic models, which were obtained with the help of the masses in very difficult situations. So he cheered up again and found the old technicians in the machine group and the comrades in the type-casting group to study, and the model of the grinding and planing machine was finally successfully made. In order to make the grinding and planing machine more perfect, the factory leadership sent him to the Beijing brother printing factory for further research.

December 1952, was the third month after he arrived in Beijing. The grinding and planing machine he originally researched, at the suggestion of the comrades in the brother factory, was to be changed to a type-casting machine, but he couldn't find the right person to help him draw the drawings. Wang Chongyin was worried again at this time: "I have been here for a few months, and the affairs of the factory have not been taken care of at all. If I don't succeed in the future, how can I face people when I return to the factory?" He wrote a letter to the factory director, requesting to return to the factory immediately to work and experiment.

A few days later, Wang Chongyin received letters from the Party, administration, Youth League, and worker comrades in the factory. The factory director told him: "Creation will not be smooth sailing, don't be discouraged, put in more effort and study carefully." The letters from the workers in the type-casting group told him: "In the case of few people, everyone still has the confidence to complete the task of the group. I hope you don't worry about the work in the factory and concentrate on making the type-casting machine a success." When Wang Chongyin saw these letters, his confidence was enhanced again. He wrote back to the factory leaders and comrades, expressing "I will never return to the factory until the experiment is successful."

After being inspired and encouraged by everyone, Wang Chongyin further researched his type-casting machine. One Saturday night, the comrades in the dormitory of the brother factory had all gone to dance, and there was no sound in the dormitory. Wang Chongyin was lying on the bed alone, thinking. Suddenly, he got inspiration: "How good would it be to install two outwardly curved machine heads on the machine, one casting characters and the other able to change type molds!" He hurriedly got up and started drawing on the table. At this time, many comrades also returned, and Wang Chongyin reported his thoughts to the comrades, and everyone was also very interested. But he found that only one machine head of the double-headed machine he thought of could turn upwards, and the other was far away. He climbed on the table again and kept thinking and drawing, so that the two machine heads could turn upwards. Finally, he came up with an inwardly curved double machine head, both ends of which could turn upwards at the same time.

He didn't know how to draw, so he bought mechanical drawing books to study. He didn't recognize the English words in the book, so he bought "Basic Knowledge of Drawing" and "Maintenance Methods of Hand Tools" to learn with reference to them. The difficulty of drawing passed, and the difficulty of marking dimensions came again, but none of this stopped his perseverance and wisdom in overcoming difficulties. He used cardboard to cut out the shapes of the length and size of the parts, and used wooden rods as tie rods to experiment. If the thickness of the parts could not be tested with cardboard, he used wood to make samples for testing.

Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of his comrades, Wang Chongyin worked hard to study technology, and the electric "Double-Headed Type-Casting Machine" was finally successfully created in early 1953. But he was not satisfied. He said: "My achievements are still far from the requirements of socialist construction, and they are not as good as the achievements of many labor models. In the future, I must continue to work hard, study technology, and dedicate all my strength for the future of the motherland."

In the first month of this year, Wang Chongyin was promoted by the factory leadership to be the leader of the fourth group in the factory. This group includes three different types of work: type-casting, binding, and proofreading, two of which he is unfamiliar with. However, in more than a month, he not only became familiar with the situation of binding and proofreading work, but also began to study and manufacture collating machines and proofreading machines from February.

    “双头铸字机”的创造者——王崇印
    雷靖恒
    今年四月十七日，青年团西北区直属机关委员会在西安举行了一个有九百多团员和青年参加的颁奖大会，将一份荣誉奖状授给“双头铸字机”的创造者、西北新中印刷厂青年工人、中国共产党候补党员王崇印。
    我国印刷工业中现在普遍采用的电动铸字机只有一个铸字机头，每换一个字模需时至少十五秒钟，每小时只能铸字二千三百个左右。王崇印所创造的“双头铸字机”有两个机头，一个机头铸着字，在另一个机头上可以换字模，每换一个字模只需一秒钟，每小时可铸字三千个以上，即提高铸字效率百分之三十。“双头铸字机”构造简单，成本也低。有的铸字机要经过三次传递才能铸成铅字， “双头铸字机”一次就可以铸成。由于“双头铸字机”减少了许多复杂而又不需要的零件，所以每部成本只有二千三百万元，而制作一部“万年铸字机”却要三千二百多万元。除此以外，“双头铸字机”的铅锅大、熔铅量多、压力足，铸出的字都很坚实。
      “双头铸字机”的创造者王崇印，今年只有二十岁；而当他把“双头铸字机”创造成功的时候，才不过十八岁。
    王崇印是陕西省洛川县人，十六岁从小学毕业出来，进了西北新中印刷厂。他在小学读书的时候喜爱劳作课程，看到机器就特别高兴。他被分配到铸字组工作后，学习技术非常起劲，不到半年，他学会了铸字技术，铸字效率超过了一般的徒工，受到了领导上的表扬。由于王崇印这时还很年轻，因而慢慢地骄傲起来了。
    党、团组织发现了这个问题，就找王崇印谈话，并领导铸字组的工人开了四、五次会。王崇印现在回忆当时的情形说：多亏大家给我及时指出毛病，帮助我端正了工作态度，要不是这样，光凭我喜爱机器，双头铸字机是创造不出来的。
    当他认识到工作的意义的时候，他的兴趣和工作需要结合了。他经常想的是：如何从机械设备和操作方法上加以改进，提高生产效率，超额完成生产任务。有一时期，大家都认为铸字的速度再不能提高了，再快就会影响到铅字的质量。王崇印就怀疑这个说法，他仔细研究操作方法，发现工人为了让铅水凝固，铸字时要将把子压下去停放一下，拉起来再停一下，其实将把子压下去一停顿，铅字已经凝固，拉起来就没有停顿一下的必要。经他建议，减少了一道手续，铸字效率提高了一倍。
    接着，王崇印又发现手摇铸字机铸出的字，要经过捣把子、磨、刨、整等复杂过程，特别是磨字要用手拿着在钢锉上磨，每天都有工人将手指磨破，影响了工人身体健康和生产任务的完成。王崇印日夜地筹思着。不知那个工人说：“是不是可以用万能铸字机来铸这大号字呢？”这句话一下提醒了王崇印，他想到虽然万能铸字机不能铸这大号字，但仿照它的出字过程，不是可以制造个磨字机吗？（万能铸字机有磨、刨等设备）从此他的研究工作便开始了。他在做磨刨机的模型时，发现万能铸字机的出字过程是摆动的，经常出毛病。后来他将出字过程改了一下，但因模型作的不好，有些零件装起来转不动，遇到这个挫折，他不再想搞了。厂长见他情绪不高，便对他说：“慢慢来，要和大家多商量，要向英雄模范学习，多想办法，不要怕困难。”王崇印听了厂长的话，晚上睡不着觉，想到许多英雄模范人物的成绩，都是在十分艰苦的情况下取得群众的帮助才得来的。于是他又振作起来，找机器组的老技工和铸字组的同志们研究，磨刨机的模型终于制作成功了。为了使磨刨机更加完善，厂里领导上派他到北京兄弟印刷厂作进
  一步研究。
      一九五二年十二月，是他到了北京后的第三个月。他原来研究的磨刨机，经兄弟厂的同志建议，要改成铸字机，可是找不到合适的人帮助他画图样。王崇印这时又发愁了：“我来了几个月，厂里的事一点也没管，将来如果搞不成功，回厂去那有脸见人呢？”他给厂长写了一封信，要求马上回厂，一边工作，一边试验。
    过了不几天，王崇印接到了厂里的党、行政、青年团和工人同志的信。厂长告诉他说：创造不会是一帆风顺的，不要灰心，多下点工夫，精心研究。铸字组工人的信告诉他：“在人员少的情况下，大家仍有信心完成本组的任务，希望你不要惦念厂里的工作，安心地将铸字机搞成功。”王崇印见到了这些信，信心又增强了，他给厂里领导上和同志们写回信，表示“不试验成功，决不回厂。”
    王崇印在受到大家启发鼓励之后，进一步研究他的铸字机。在一个星期六的晚上，兄弟厂宿舍里的同志都跳舞去了，宿舍里静悄悄地没点声息，王崇印独自一人躺在床上思索着，突然他得到了启示：“机器上装上两个向外弯的机头，一个铸着字，另一个能换字模多好呀！”他急忙地爬起来，在桌子上划了起来。这时，许多同志也回来了，王崇印便向同志们报告他刚才的想法，大家也很感兴趣。但他发觉他所想的双头机只有一个机头能转到向上，另
  一个差的很远。他又爬在桌子上不停地在想、在划，使得两个机头能转到向上。到底想出了向内弯的双机头，两头同时又能转到向上。
    不会绘图，他就去买了机械制图书来学习，认不得书上的英文字，又买了“绘图基本知识”、“手工具维护法”参照着学。绘图的难关过去了，标尺寸的难关又来了，但这都没有挡住他克服困难的毅力和智慧，零件的长短大小，他用硬纸剪成样子，用木杆作拉杆来试验，零件的厚薄，硬纸试验不成，他就用木头做成样子来作试验。
    王崇印在党的领导与同志们的帮助下，刻苦钻研技术，电动“双头铸字机”终于在一九五三年初胜利地创造成功了。可是他并不满足，他说：“我这些成绩，距离社会主义建设的要求还差的很远，也比不上许多劳动模范的成绩，今后要继续努力，钻研技术，为了祖国的明天，献出自己的全部力量。”
    今年正月，王崇印经厂的领导上提拔为厂内第四组组长。这组内包括着铸字、装订、校对三种性质不同的工作，其中有两种他都很生疏，但他在一个多月的时间内，不仅熟悉了装订和校对工作的情况，并从二月份开始，研究制造配页机和校对机了。
