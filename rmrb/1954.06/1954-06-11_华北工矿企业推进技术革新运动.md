Xinhua News Agency report:

    Influenced by the achievements of technological innovation in Anshan Iron and Steel, factories and enterprises in North China are further developing the technological innovation movement in an organized and planned manner. From mid-April to early June, a total of more than 24,000 employees in North China were organized to visit the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition." The visiting representatives of various factories and mines who have returned to their factories are organizing various forums and study classes to convey and study what they learned. Shijingshan Power Plant has convened a meeting of propagandists and activists from the entire plant, using them to return to the workshops and universally mobilize employees to carry out technological innovation. Xinhua Printing Factory has organized trade union group leaders and production team leaders to form amateur training classes, preparing them to be the backbone of the technological innovation movement. The Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions also held a short-term training class in mid-May attended by grassroots trade union chairmen or workshop trade union chairmen from factories and mines. The advanced workers' night school in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant originally focused on political classes, but recently temporarily changed to technical innovation courses. In order to widely mobilize employees to actively participate in technological innovation, many regions, factories, and mines have already held or are preparing to hold technological innovation exhibitions in their regions or units. North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Beijing Electric Power Bureau and other units have held small-scale technological innovation exhibitions, displaying the achievements of employees' past technological innovations, and some also displayed a large number of accumulated stagnant equipment and waste materials, mobilizing everyone to use their brains to utilize them.
    Based on the experience of technological innovation in Anshan Iron and Steel, many factories and mines in North China have examined the problems existing in the past rationalization proposal work from top to bottom, actively clearing up accumulated rationalization proposals, adjusting and improving the rationalization proposal committees, and starting to formulate plans for comprehensively carrying out the technological innovation movement. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently decided on improved measures for the organizational structure, dedicated personnel, materials, and funding in the review and implementation process of rationalization proposals. They decided to set up a dedicated person in the technology section to be responsible for the review and appraisal of major rationalization proposals. Workshops and larger work sections established rationalization proposal groups composed of technicians and workers to be responsible for researching and reviewing innovation proposals put forward by employees of their units. The administrative leadership also decided to allocate 500 million to 1 billion yuan this year as expenses for employees to experiment with innovation proposals. In the process of implementing rationalization proposals, in terms of design, construction, and materials, it was decided that the General Machinery Office and the repair work sections of each workshop would be responsible for incorporating the approved proposals into the monthly design and construction work plan; at the same time, a certain amount of time and manpower would be reserved to deal with urgent proposals temporarily. The Technology Section of North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant has incorporated 250 rationalization proposals into the technical organization measures plan. According to preliminary calculations, the production and increased production and conservation plan drawn up by the factory's employees discussing the national plan with the spirit of technological innovation will be 52 percent higher than the original national plan. The chief engineer and chairman of the trade union of Zhangjiakou Mining Machinery Plant recently spent a week concentrating on dealing with the factory's long-term accumulation of rationalization proposals, and prepared to set up a special agency to handle rationalization proposals in response to past shortcomings. Tangshan Steel Plant is formulating a schedule plan for major technical improvements throughout the year in accordance with the factory's development plan and the needs of national tasks. Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has identified twelve key problems existing in the factory's current production as the subject of technological innovation for the entire factory.
    The achievements of technological innovation in Anshan Iron and Steel have further encouraged the confidence and enthusiasm of employees in various parts of North China in technological innovation. The whole province of Shanxi only realized twelve major technological innovation proposals in the first quarter, while there were fifteen in May. According to statistics from twelve units including Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan Steel Plant, and Tangshan Power Plant in Tangshan City, employees put forward a total of 1,075 rationalization proposals in April, while 2,111 were put forward in the first and middle ten days of May. Many of the rationalization proposals put forward by employees revolve around key issues in production, thus effectively guaranteeing the completion of the production plan. For example, in May, the steelmaking department of Tangshan Steel Plant solved the problem of the supply of molten iron from the pig iron furnace, which played a decisive role in completing the May plan, thanks to the initiatives of employees.
    Local organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels in North China attach great importance to carrying out the technological innovation movement. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee included technological innovation as one of the important contents of the industrial production and capital construction reporting meeting that began on June 5. After the first delegation from Shanxi Province to visit the "Anshan Iron and Steel Technological Innovation Exhibition" returned to Taiyuan, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately instructed its municipal and regional committees to conscientiously organize the communication and study of Anshan Iron and Steel's experience. The Industrial Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions are now convening cadres from factories and mining enterprises to report on the situation and dispatching working groups to factories to understand the situation and problems of the technological innovation movement in factories and mining enterprises throughout the city. The Industrial Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also made a decision on May 29 on inter-factory competitions centered on technological innovation. The attention and strengthened leadership of local organizations of the Communist Party of China at all levels in North China have become an important driving force for carrying out the technological innovation movement.

    华北工矿企业推进技术革新运动
    据新华社讯：华北区各厂矿、企业在鞍钢技术革新成就的影响下，正有组织、有计划地进一步开展技术革新运动。从四月中旬到六月初，华北区有组织地参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的职工共有二万四千多人。已经回厂的各厂矿参观代表正分别组织各种座谈会、学习班进行传达和学习。石景山发电厂已召开了全厂宣传员、积极分子会议，通过他们回到车间普遍发动职工开展技术革新运动。新华印刷厂已组织工会小组长、生产小组长成立业余训练班，准备作为开展技术革新运动的骨干。石家庄市工会联合会在五月中旬还举办了一期由厂矿基层工会主席或车间工会主席参加的短期学习班。太原钢铁厂先进工作者夜校原以政治课为主要内容，最近也临时改为专上技术革新的课程。为了广泛动员职工积极参加到技术革新的行列中来，许多地区、厂矿已经或正在筹备举行本地区、本单位的技术革新展览会。华北农业机械总厂、清河制呢厂、北京电业局等单位举办了小型的技术革新展览会，展出职工过去技术革新的成绩，有的还陈列了积压的大批呆滞器材和废料，动员大家开动脑筋加以利用。
    根据鞍钢技术革新的经验，华北区许多厂矿自上而下地检查了过去合理化建议工作中所存在的问题，积极清理过去积压的合理化建议，调整和健全合理化建议委员会，并着手制订全面开展技术革新运动的计划。石景山钢铁厂最近对合理化建议的审查及实现过程中的组织机构、专责人员以及材料、经费等方面，都决定了改进的措施。他们确定在技术课内设立专人，负责重大合理化建议的审查和鉴定工作。车间和较大的工段，成立由技术人员和工人组成的合理化建议小组，负责研究和审查本单位职工提出的革新创议。行政领导方面并决定在今年年内拨出五亿到十亿元，作为职工试验革新创议的费用。在实现合理化建议过程中的设计、施工和材料等方面，决定由总机械室和各车间修理工段负责把已批准的建议列入每月的设计和施工的作业计划；同时并留出一定的时间和人力，准备临时处理紧急的建议。华北农业机械总厂技术科并已把二百五十项合理化建议订入技术组织措施计划。这个厂的职工由于以技术革新精神讨论国家计划，据初步计算，订出的生产和增产节约计划将比原国家计划提高百分之五十二。张家口矿山机械厂总工程师和工会主席最近以一个星期时间，集中处理了厂内过去长期积压的合理化建议，并准备针对过去的缺点，设立处理合理化建议的专责机构。唐山钢厂依照工厂发展计划和国家任务的需要，正在制订全年重大技术改进的进度计划。太原机车车辆修理工厂找出了全厂当前生产中存在的十二项关键问题，作为全厂技术革新的课题。
    鞍钢技术革新的成就，进一步鼓舞了华北区各地职工技术革新的信心和热情。山西省全省在第一季度实现的重大技术革新创议只十二件，而五月份就有十五件。唐山市的开滦煤矿、唐山钢厂、唐山发电厂等十二个单位统计，四月份职工提出的合理化建议共一千零七十五件，而五月份上、中两旬就提出了二千一百一十一件。很多职工提出的合理化建议都是围绕生产中的关键问题，因而有力地保证了生产计划的完成。如唐山钢厂炼钢部五月份由于职工的创议，解决了对完成五月份计划有决定作用的化铁炉铁水的供应问题。
    华北区中共各级地方组织对开展技术革新运动都极为重视。中共中央华北局从六月五日起召开的工业生产、基本建设汇报会议，就把技术革新列为会议的重要内容之一。山西省第一批参观“鞍钢技术革新展览会”的代表团回到太原后，中共山西省委立即指示所属各市委、地委认真组织传达和学习鞍钢的经验。中共北京市委员会工业部和北京市总工会现正召集各厂矿企业的干部进行汇报，并派出工作组下厂，了解全市厂矿企业技术革新运动的情况和问题。中共天津市委工业部在五月二十九日并作出了以技术革新为中心内容的厂际竞赛的决定。华北区中共各级地方组织的重视和加强领导，已成为开展技术革新运动的重要推进力量。
