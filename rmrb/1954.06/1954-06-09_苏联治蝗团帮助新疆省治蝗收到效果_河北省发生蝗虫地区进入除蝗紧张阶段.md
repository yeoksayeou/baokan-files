Under the assistance of the Soviet locust control team and locust control aircraft for more than twenty days, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have controlled locust plagues on 600,000 mu of farmland and grassland. Around May 10th, ten counties in the Urumqi and Tacheng regions, as well as the suburbs of Urumqi City and parts of the Ili region and southern Xinjiang, launched locust control work. Of these areas, 450,000 mu of farmland and grassland with denser locust nymphs were treated by ten Soviet locust control aircraft, while the remaining 150,000 mu of farmland and grassland with sparse locust nymphs were treated by farmers of all ethnic groups using pesticide sprayers and manual swatting. After treatment, the mortality rate of locust nymphs generally reached over 80%. Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups are carrying out farmland management work. (Xinhua News Agency) ×××

The areas in Hebei Province affected by locusts have entered a tense phase of locust control. According to incomplete statistics from locust areas such as Huanghua, Xianxian, and Jingxian, more than 52,500 mu of land had been cleared of locusts by June 3rd.

This year, the Party and government leading organs in the general locust areas of Hebei Province have paid relatively high attention to locust control work. They started preparing for locust control as early as April, and the entire province prepared a total of 5 million jin of "666" pesticide powder, 1 million jin of wheat bran, and more than 9,600 powder sprayers. In early May, when locusts began to hatch, a large number of pesticides and equipment were transferred to the counties. Before the locusts emerged, each county held locust control meetings to implement the locust control policies, criticize complacency and empiricism. After the locusts appeared, counties, districts, and townships also dispatched a certain number of cadres to participate in locust control work.

In the process of locust control, all localities have adopted a method of first treating locusts in crop fields and those with high density, then treating locusts in wasteland areas and those with low density, according to the characteristics of this year's locusts. Continuous control methods were adopted in crop fields to minimize or eliminate damage to crops. This saves labor and pesticides and ensures that most locust nymphs are eliminated before the third instar.

    河北省发生蝗虫地区进入除蝗紧张阶段
    二十多天来，在苏联治蝗团和治蝗飞机的帮助下，新疆各族农民已防治了六十万亩农田和草场上的蝗害。五月十日前后，乌鲁木齐、塔城两专区的十个县和乌鲁木齐市郊以及伊犁专区和新疆南部部分地区，便展开了防治蝗虫工作。这些地区有四十五万亩蝗蝻较密的农田和草场，由十架苏联治蝗飞机防治，其余十五万亩农田和草场蝗蝻较稀，由各族农民用药械和人工扑打。经过防治以后，蝗蝻死亡率一般达到百分之八十以上。现在，各族农民正在进行农田管理工作。（新华社）×××
    河北省发生蝗虫的地区已进入除蝗紧张阶段，到六月三日，据黄骅、献县、景县等蝗区的不完全统计，已把五万二千五百多亩地的蝗虫消灭。
    今年河北省一般蝗区的党政领导机关对除蝗工作比较重视。从四月份就先后动手进行了除蝗的各项准备工作，全省共准备了“六六六”药粉五百万斤，麦麸一百万斤，喷粉器九千六百多架。五月上旬，蝗虫开始孵化出土时，大批药械就已调运到县。各县在蝗虫出土前都召开了治蝗会议，贯彻了治蝗方针，批判了麻痹思想和经验主义，蝗虫发生后，各县、区、乡也都抽出了一定数量的干部投入除蝗工作。
    各地在除蝗当中，都根据今年蝗虫的特点，先治作物地内的和密度厚的蝗虫，后治荒洼地区的和密度稀的蝗虫。在作物地内采取了连续除治的方法，尽量使作物少受害和不受害。这样既省工、省药，又做到了把大部蝗蝻消灭在三龄以前。
