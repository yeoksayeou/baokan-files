National Rights Cannot Be Obliterated
Hu Sisheng

The Geneva Conference has been underway for over a month. Two attitudes towards Asian issues are becoming increasingly clear.

One attitude advocates for agreements at the Geneva Conference based on respect for national rights, believing that the people of Asian countries have the right to solve their own problems, to obtain their national independence, national unification, and democratic freedoms, and to live peaceful lives on their own land without external interference and oppression. The representatives of the four democratic countries—China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Vietnam—have adopted this just and reasonable attitude.

The other attitude seeks to maintain colonial rule in Asia, expand aggressive wars in Asia, and deprive the people of Asian countries of their national rights and enslave them. The U.S. delegation and its followers have adopted this unreasonable attitude.

In the process of the Geneva Conference discussing the Korean and Indochinese issues, the principle of respecting the national rights of the Korean and Indochinese people has been neglected and obliterated by the delegations of Western countries.

The proposal put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il and supported by China and the Soviet Union advocated that all foreign troops should be withdrawn simultaneously and periodically, and that a Pan-Korean Commission should be established by North and South Korea to prepare for and preside over free elections throughout Korea, thereby establishing a national democratic and unified government. This proposal aims to realize the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people for independence, democracy, and unification on the basis of Koreans solving their own problems. The rationality of this proposal is undeniable.

However, the U.S. delegation and its followers attempted to completely disregard the national rights of the Korean people, unreasonably rejected the reasonable proposal of Foreign Minister Nam Il, and only blindly supported the unreasonable demands and so-called fourteen-point "proposal" of the Syngman Rhee government representative, who attempted to expand the fascist rule of South Korea to North Korea and have the United States rule the entire Korean peninsula.

Logically, due to the special circumstances of North and South Korea, it is necessary and reasonable for both sides to resolve the issue of Korean unification through mutual agreement. However, the United States has consistently expressed opposition. Using the disparity in population between North and South Korea as an excuse, they advocated the establishment of a Pan-Korean Commission with members elected by each side in proportion to the population and decided by majority vote. This would allow the Syngman Rhee group, which cannot represent the people of South Korea at all, to gain a majority in this commission and force the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to accept the will of the United States and the Syngman Rhee group. The United States actually wanted to use such a clumsy trick to achieve the goal of imposing the rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee on the people of North Korea, a goal that the United States had failed to achieve in more than three years of aggressive war and the loss of more than 390,000 lives.

Not only that, but the United States also insisted that the Korean elections must be supervised by the United Nations, which the United States had placed in the position of a belligerent party in Korea. At the same time, when such elections were held, U.S. troops would still remain there. The United States wanted to continue to interfere in Korean internal affairs with a bayonet in hand and under the banner of the United Nations, implementing so-called "free elections." They even shamelessly staged another "election" under "United Nations supervision" in South Korea on May 20, in which the people were deprived of basic democratic rights and freedoms by lawless acts of terror. The U.S. aggressors, who have always chanted "democracy" and "human rights," did not hesitate to discard their "democratic" masks here.

The reason why the discussion of the Korean issue has reached a stalemate is that the U.S. ruling group completely disregards and wants to deprive the entire Korean people of their national and democratic rights.

The main obstacle encountered by the Geneva Conference in discussing the Indochina issue is also that some countries, especially the United States, are unwilling to restore peace in Indochina on the basis of respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people.

Everyone knows that the eight specific proposals put forward by Deputy Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong express the will of the Indochinese people to fight for peace, independence, unity, and democracy, and their reasonable demands. They also point out the principles for establishing normal relations between the three countries of Indochina and France, thereby providing a practical basis for the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. This fair and reasonable proposal was supported by the delegations of China and the Soviet Union. However, France, already in a difficult situation, still regarded itself as a colonizer, nostalgic for its position of nearly a century of enslavement and exploitation of the Indochinese people; the ambitious U.S. interventionists seized the opportunity to interfere, harboring the arrogant plan of encompassing Indochina, obstructing the restoration of peace in Indochina, and further setting a great fire in Indochina.

These colonizers and ambitious individuals openly admit that "Ho Chi Minh is deeply loved by the people," so they nakedly peeled off the cloak of "democracy" and "freedom" and feared discussing the political issues of Indochina as if they feared the sun. They demanded to talk only about military affairs and not about politics. They said that "a political solution cannot be a condition for stopping the conflict" and that the Indochina issue "is not a question of the independence of these countries." They even wanted to cover the eyes and ears of the world, saying that the Indochina war had nothing to do with France's attempt to continue to preserve colonial rule by force and the national liberation struggle of the Indochinese people for independence and freedom. This war seems to be a war without any political content. Everyone knows that such a war has never happened in history. The nature of the Indochina war, which has continued for eight years, is even more obvious.

However, these colonizers, whether in rejecting Deputy Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong's eight-point proposal or in defending themselves and making colonial demands, cannot escape their political stance and cannot hide their political goals. Bidault used to say that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was a "ghost," and now he says that the resistance governments of Cambodia and Laos are "ghosts"; at the same time, Bidault put forward military conditions aimed at eliminating the armed forces and democratic governments of the Indochinese people. What does this show? Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that Bidault is pursuing the political goal of French colonial rule under the guise of not talking about a political solution?

Bidault's insistence on separating the issues of Laos and Cambodia from the issue of Vietnam, attempting to obliterate the growing national liberation struggle waged by the people of Laos and Cambodia for national independence for a long time, more nakedly exposes his desire to maintain its complete colonial rule in these two countries.

People see that the U.S. ruling group is taking the same colonialist position on the Indochina issue, but it harbors more sinister ulterior motives. The U.S.'s accelerated plan to piece together the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group" completely exposes this point. The U.S. ruling group does not conceal its plan, which is not only to undermine the Geneva Conference, but also to "internationalize" the Indochina war, thereby establishing a U.S. colonial empire in Asia. Eisenhower said nakedly in his speech to American business tycoons on the opening day of the Geneva Conference: "Indochina and the struggle there" are "to us like a cork in a bottle, and that bottle is the vast region including Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, and the surrounding areas of Asia, with its billions of people and geographical location controlling several lines of communication—not to mention its rich production, some of which we must obtain."

The public opinion of Asian countries clearly sees the actual intention of this conspiracy plan of the United States. The Indian "Blitz" recently pointed out: "Through this forced Southeast Asian political and military bloc, the United States can not only turn Asian countries into its colonies and deprive the people of India, Burma, and Indonesia of the freedom they gained in the long and tenacious struggle against Western rule, but also use the huge manpower of those Asian countries ruled by puppets obedient to the U.S. government as cannon fodder to carry out wars to suppress national liberation movements. In short, this plan is the highest expression of the Republican Party's formula of 'using Asians to fight Asians'."

It is completely unsuitable for the reality they are in today that the colonizers so arrogantly obliterate the national rights of the Korean and Indochinese people. If they cannot deprive these countries of their national rights on the battlefield, how can they achieve their goals at the negotiating table?

The desire of the Korean people, the Indochinese people, and the people of Asian countries to enjoy the rights of independence, freedom, and equality is legitimate and not excessive at all. The various conferences and declarations and announcements convened by the Allied countries during World War II all recognized that the principles of national equality and national self-determination are inviolable. The "Atlantic Charter" signed by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill on August 14, 1941, also stated that "the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live should be respected." What is particularly embarrassing for the colonizers is that the American Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man also affirmed that national rights cannot be obliterated. The "American Declaration of Independence" states: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." and states that "it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish" the government. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man also states: "Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good." Therefore, as Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out at the Geneva Conference on May 12: "The governments of the countries that issued these two great declarations in 1776 and 1791 should recognize that the people of Indochina, like the people of the United States and France, must fully enjoy the rights of independence, freedom, and equality."

It can be seen that it is unreasonable and untenable for these colonizers to refuse to accept the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina at the Geneva Conference on the basis of respecting national rights. It is clear that only respect for national rights is the fundamental principle for solving the Korean issue, the Indochina issue, and other Asian issues. The will of the Korean and Indochinese people, who have already stood up, to strive for and defend their national rights cannot be ignored and cannot be conquered. The people of the world who love peace, independence, and freedom support this just struggle.

    民族权利是不容抹煞的
    胡思升
    日内瓦会议已开了一个多月。对待亚洲问题的两种态度日益鲜明地显现出来了。
    一种态度是主张日内瓦会议应在尊重民族权利的基础上谋求协议，认为亚洲各国人民有权自己解决自己的事情，有权获得他们的民族独立、国家统一和民主自由，并不受外力的干涉和压迫而在他们的土地上过和平生活。中、苏、朝、越四个民主国家的代表采取的就是这种正当合理的态度。
    另一种态度所追求的目的是要保持殖民国家在亚洲的殖民统治，在亚洲扩大侵略战争，剥夺亚洲各国人民的民族权利和奴役亚洲人民。美国代表团和它的追随者采取的就是这种无理态度。
    在日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的过程中，尊重朝鲜和印度支那人民的民族权利的原则，受到了西方国家代表团的忽视和抹煞。
    南日外务相提出并得到中苏两国支持的建议，主张一切外国军队应该同时定期撤退，由南北朝鲜成立全朝鲜委员会筹备和主持全朝鲜的自由选举，从而成立全国性的民主统一的政府。这个建议就是要在朝鲜人自己解决问题的基础上实现朝鲜人民要求独立、民主、统一的正当愿望。这个建议的合理性是无可争辩的。
    但是，美国代表团及其追随者企图根本无视朝鲜人民的民族权利，毫无道理地拒绝南日外务相的合理建议，而只是一味支持李承晚政府代表妄图把南朝鲜的法西斯统治扩展到北朝鲜、由美国来统治全朝鲜的无理主张和所谓十四点“建议”。
    按道理讲，由于现存南北朝鲜的特殊情况，由南北朝鲜双方通过互相协议来解决朝鲜的统一问题是必要的，而且是合理的。但是，美国始终表示反对。他们以南北朝鲜人口不等为借口，主张成立一个每方按人口比例选举委员、依多数表决的全朝鲜委员会。这就是要由根本不能代表南朝鲜人民的李承晚集团在这个委员会中取得多数地位，来强迫朝鲜民主主义人民共和国接受美国和李承晚集团的意志。美国居然想用这种拙劣的手法来达到美国用三年多的侵略战争、损失三十九万多人都没有达到的把美李统治强加在北朝鲜人民头上的目的。
    不仅如此，美国并坚持必须由已被美国置于朝鲜交战一方的地位的联合国来监督朝鲜的选举。同时，在举行这样的选举的时候，美国侵朝军队也还要留在那里。美国想继续手持刺刀，打着联合国的旗帜来干涉朝鲜内政，实行所谓“自由选举”。他们甚至不知羞耻地在五月二十日再一次在南朝鲜导演了一场“联合国监督”的“选举”，在这次选举中，人民被无法无天的恐怖暴行剥夺了基本民主权利和自由。一直高唱“民主”、“人权”的美国侵略者在这里不惜把他们的“民主”的假面具，丢在一旁了。
    朝鲜问题的讨论所以陷于僵持局面的原因，就在于美国统治集团根本无视、并想剥夺全朝鲜人民的民族和民主权利。
    日内瓦会议在讨论印度支那问题时遭遇的主要障碍，也在于有些国家特别是美国的代表不愿在尊重印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那的和平。
    谁都知道，范文同代外长提出的八点具体建议，表达了印度支那人民为和平、独立、统一、民主而斗争的意志和他们的合理要求，同时也指出了建立印度支那三个国家和法国之间的正常关系的原则，从而为和平解决印度支那问题提供了切实的基础。这个公平合理的建议得到了中苏两国代表团的支持。但是已经陷于困境的法国居然以殖民者自居，留恋它在将近一世纪之久的奴役和剥削印度支那人民的地位；野心勃勃的美国干涉者则乘机插手，怀抱着囊括印度支那的狂妄计划，阻挠印度支那和平的恢复，进而在印度支那放起大火来。
    这些殖民者和野心家公开承认“胡志明深得人心”，因而他们就赤裸裸地剥开了“民主”“自由”的外衣，像怕见太阳那样害怕讨论印度支那的政治问题。他们要求只谈军事而不谈政治。他们说什么 “政治解决不能成为停止冲突的条件”，说什么印度支那问题“并不是一个这些国家独立的问题”。他们甚至想一手遮住天下耳目，把印度支那战争说成与法国企图用武力来继续保全殖民统治和印度支那人民争取独立自由的民族解放斗争没有什么关系。这个战争好像是没有什么政治内容的战争。谁都知道，这样的战争，在历史上从来也未发生过。继续了八年的印度支那战争的性质，更是明显不过的。
    但是，这些殖民者们不论是在拒绝范文同代外长的八点建议的时候，或是在替自己辩护和提出殖民主义要求的时候，都离不开他们的政治立场，掩藏不了他们的政治目的。皮杜尔过去说越南民主共和国是“幽灵”，现在又说高棉和寮国抗战政府是“幽灵”；同时皮杜尔提出了目的在于消灭印度支那人民的武装和民主政府的军事条件。这说明什么呢？如果说皮杜尔在不谈政治解决的幌子下追求着法国殖民统治的政治目的，不是更正确些吗？
    皮杜尔坚持把寮国、高棉问题和越南问题分开处理，企图抹煞寮国和高棉人民长期为争取民族独立而进行的日益壮大的民族解放斗争，这就更露骨地暴露了他想在这两个国家里保持其完整的殖民统治。
    人们看到，美国统治集团在印度支那问题上采取着同样的殖民主义者的立场，但它包藏着更加凶恶的阴谋目的。美国加紧拼凑所谓“东南亚防御集团”的计划彻底地暴露了这一点。美国统治集团毫不掩饰它的这个计划，不仅要搞垮日内瓦会议，而且要把印度支那战争“国际化”，从而在亚洲建立美国的殖民帝国。艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议开幕那天对美国商界巨头发表的演说就赤裸裸地说：“印度支那以及在那里进行的斗争”，“对我们来说，就像一个瓶子中的木塞一样，这个瓶子就是包括印尼、缅甸、泰国和周围的亚洲各地的巨大地区及其亿万人民和控制着好几条交通线的地理位置——更不用说它的丰富的出产了，而这些出产中有一些是我们必须得到的”。
    亚洲各国舆论对美国的这个阴谋计划的实际意图，都是看得清清楚楚的。印度“闪电”周报最近就指出：“美国通过这种强迫拼凑成的东南亚政治、军事集团，不仅可以把亚洲国家变成它的殖民地、并剥夺印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚人民在长期顽强的反对西方统治的斗争中获得的自由，而且还可以利用美国政府的顺从的傀儡所统治的那些亚洲国家的巨大人力作炮灰，来进行镇压民族解放运动的战争。总之，这个计划是共和党的‘用亚洲人打亚洲人’的公式的最高表现。”
    殖民者们如此蛮横无理地抹煞朝鲜和印度支那人民的民族权利，对于它们今天所处的现实情况，是完全不适合的。他们在战场上已剥夺不了这些国人民的民族权利，又怎么能在会议桌上达到目的呢？
    朝鲜人民、印度支那人民和亚洲各国人民要求享受独立、自由平等的权利的愿望是光明正大的，是一点也不过分的。第二次大战期间盟国召开的各次会议及其宣言、公告都承认民族平等、民族自决权的原则是不可侵犯的。一九四一年八月十四日由美国总统罗斯福和英国首相邱吉尔签署的“大西洋宪章”，也表示应该“尊重各民族自由决定其所赖以生存之政府形式之权利”。特别使殖民者难堪的是，美国独立宣言和法国民权宣言也都肯定了民族权利是不容抹煞的。“美国独立宣言”说：“一切人们生来就是平等的，他们应有这些天赋的不可剥夺的权利，那就是生存、自由和追求幸福的权利”；并说：“改变或取消政府，是属于人民底法权的”。法国民权宣言也说：“天赋人类自由和平等的权利，人们就时时都可以享受自由和平等的权利。”因此，正如周恩来外长在五月十二日的日内瓦会议上指出的：“曾经在一七七六年和一七九一年发表过这两个伟大宣言的国家的政府，应该承认印度支那人民同美国和法国的人民一样，是必须完全享受独立、自由和平等的权利的。”
    由此可见，这些殖民者在日内瓦会议上不肯接受在尊重民族权利的基础上来和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那的和平，是多末的不合理，多末的站不住脚。很显然，只有尊重民族权利，才是解决朝鲜问题、印度支那问题和其他亚洲问题的根本原则。已经站起来了的朝鲜和印度支那人民争取和捍卫他们的民族权利的意志，是不容漠视的，是征服不了的。全世界爱好和平与独立自由的人民都支持这个正义的斗争。
