    Liuzhou Machinery Factory Manufactures an Amphibious Walking Plow
    The workers of the state-owned Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi Province have manufactured a walking plow suitable for cultivation in various soil types in both paddy and dry fields. This walking plow has many advantages: the curvature of the moldboard can be flexibly adjusted to reduce the problems of sticky mud, soil build-up, and poor soil inversion; it can be equipped with three types of plowshares, five, six, or seven inches in size; the depth adjustment range of the plow beam reaches forty centimeters (while general walking plows are only around twenty-two centimeters), making it very flexible and adaptable to different situations such as varying animal power, soil texture, and livestock height. At the same time, this walking plow weighs only thirty catties in total, which is sixteen to twenty catties lighter than the seven-inch walking plows in North China, making it very easy to use.
    After more than half a year of trial production and more than a hundred experiments on different soils in Guangxi Province, the workers of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory achieved good results and were welcomed by farmers everywhere. The more than four hundred walking plows already produced by the factory were quickly bought up by farmers. The Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry originally planned to promote another five hundred units this year, but due to the urgent need for this type of walking plow among farmers, the plan has been increased to three thousand units this spring.

    柳州机械厂制造了一种水旱两用的步犁
    广西省地方国营柳州机械厂职工制造了一种适合于水田和旱地多种土壤上耕作的步犁。这种步犁有很多优点：犁镜弯度能够灵活地调节，以减少粘泥、顶胚和翻土不好的毛病；它可以配用五吋、六吋或七吋的三种犁尖，犁辕深浅调节幅度达四十公分（一般步犁为二十二公分上下）因而灵活性很大，可以适应畜力大小、土质软硬和牲口高矮等等不同情况。同时，这种步犁全重只有三十市斤，较华北地区的七吋步犁轻十六到二十市斤，所以使用起来很轻快。
    柳州机械厂职工经过半年多的试制，又在广西省各地不同的土壤上进行了百多次的试验，效果很好，受到了各地农民的欢迎。该厂已制就的四百多部步犁，很快就给农民买完了。广西省农林厅原计划在今年再推广五百部，由于农民对这种步犁的需要迫切，今春已将计划增到三千部。　（黎行）
