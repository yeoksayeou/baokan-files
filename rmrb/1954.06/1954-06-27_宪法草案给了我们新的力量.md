A Letter to the Motherland

    The Draft Constitution Gives Us New Strength
    Zheng Changhua, Second-Class Combat Hero of the Volunteer Army Air Force

Dear people of the Motherland:

We Volunteer Army Air Force soldiers, far from the Motherland, are so eager to know the situation in the Motherland. Whether in the past during breaks in fighting or now in our spare time from studying, we always make it a habit to listen to the Motherland's broadcasts. Any achievement of the Motherland directly becomes a source of encouragement for us.

On June 14th, after a day of intense study, I turned on the radio as usual to listen to news from the Motherland. What's this? Today's prelude isn't "The New Democracy March," but the national anthem. I thought to myself: There must be important news. Sure enough, as soon as the national anthem finished playing, the announcer's unusually excited voice came from the loudspeaker:

  “...The Central People's Government Committee held its thirtieth meeting on the afternoon of the fourteenth, and unanimously adopted the 'Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.' The meeting was presided over by Chairman Mao Zedong...” At this moment, how excited I was! I held my breath and listened attentively to the announcer reading the full text of the draft constitution. As I listened, I thought...

    Especially when I heard the chapter on "Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens," I couldn't help but think of the old society, my poor family, and my old father who suffered a lifetime of oppression and exploitation by the landlord class and had no right to live. Until his death, he didn't own a single piece of land. He tilled land for the landlord Zheng Changfang for twenty years, but when he died, he didn't even have a place to bury himself. On the day of my father's funeral, my kind mother went to plead with the landlord, hoping that the landlord would give my father a small plot of land for a grave in consideration of the twenty years he had tilled the land for him, but the landlord only sneered and pushed my mother out the door. Poor father, he had to be buried in a mass grave. In the old society, weren't there thousands upon thousands of working people who suffered like my father? And the laws of the old society provided no guarantee for the living rights of the working people! Recalling the past, looking at the present, and thinking about the future, I can't help but be extremely happy for the working people of China who will be able to enjoy the rights to work, rest, and material assistance stipulated in the draft constitution. But then I thought: How difficult it was to produce this draft constitution! It embodies the lives and blood of so many revolutionary martyrs!

    After listening to the broadcast, it was already late at night, but the announcer's voice kept echoing in my mind, and my excitement made it difficult for me to fall asleep. I recalled the arduous struggle that the Party and Chairman Mao led the people of the Motherland through in the past, and I recalled those comrades who sacrificed their lives for the Motherland. I will never forget Platoon Leader Lu, with whom I lived and fought. It was in the spring of 1948, during the fierce battle to besiege Linfen. He was seriously wounded, and before he died, with infinite reluctance to part with the revolutionary cause, he said to me: "Instructor, I can't work for the Party anymore. There are still many people in the country suffering oppression. The task of liberating them is left to you!" Today, on the day the draft constitution is announced, I can't help but express my deep remembrance for this close comrade who, even before he stopped breathing, was still concerned about the liberation of the people of the whole country.

    That night, I also recalled the unforgettable battle scenes during the difficult War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, I was a branch secretary in a company of the New Fourth Army. Each battle, each victory, came at a considerable cost, and the number of Communist Party members who sacrificed was often greater than that of the masses. Whenever there were casualties, I felt deeply saddened and grieved. However, whenever I calmed down and thought: To make a revolution, there will be sacrifice and bloodshed. All those who dedicate their lives to the Motherland will be rewarded in the future. I first restrained my grief for the sacrificed comrades and called on the Communist Party members and all the soldiers in the company to turn grief into strength and continue to fight the enemy. How many martyrs sacrificed their lives for the Motherland! Today, they have truly received a great reward.

    Today, I cannot forget the difficult battles in Korea. After the movement to resist America and aid Korea unfolded, I joined the Volunteer Army with the determination to help the Korean people defeat the aggressors, defend the construction of the Motherland, and defend the fruits of the people's revolution. Our love for the Motherland and our hatred for the enemy gave us infinite wisdom and strength in our battles against the American air bandits. I remember one battle in January 1953, our flight was patrolling the skies of Korea when suddenly we received a report that enemy planes, three times our number, were approaching North Korea in a three-sided encirclement formation. At this time, I calculated in my mind: The cunning enemy is using the "pocket" tactic. If we divide our forces to meet them, our strength will not be enough. If we attack one enemy force, we will be attacked by the other two. We should find the enemy's weakness. After this brief consideration, I decisively led the flight and charged head-on into the enemy in the middle. The enemy was frightened by our courageous and sudden action and hastily dodged to the side, and the enemy's formation was disrupted. At that moment, I heard the ground commander issue the order from my headphones: "Seize the enemy's weakness and hit them hard!" So I immediately commanded the entire team to sharply turn the nose of our planes and launch a fierce attack on the right wing of the enemy's formation. At first, the enemy tried to use its numerical advantage to break free of the passive position and counterattack us, but we would not allow the enemy to regain the initiative. I commanded the flight to use small formations to launch several fierce attacks on the confused enemy planes. As a result, we victoriously shattered the enemy's conspiracy to encircle us and shot down three enemy planes.

    After each flight mission, I often thought, aerial combat is different from ground combat. Every minute, we pass through countless clouds and cross countless mountains. The victory of a battle is often decided in tense seconds. How can I better complete the task that the Motherland has entrusted to me? Every night I pondered this question.

    One day, the political commissar said to me: "The people of the Motherland have entrusted us with the glorious task of supporting the Korean people, defending the construction of the Motherland, and striking at the American air bandits. As an air force commander, you must be good at summing up combat experience and concentrating everyone's wisdom, and then using it to guide everyone's actions. You must remember that the pilot's courage and wisdom must be reflected and brought into play in combat through your correct command." These profound insights generated infinite strength in me. In accordance with this correct operational guiding ideology, and with the strong support of the Motherland and the Korean people, our air force unit shot down and damaged 47 enemy planes from August 1952 to March 1953. I personally shot down two enemy planes. Our unit collectively received a second-class merit, and among the pilots, Li Lanmao, Jiang Longting, Tang Yanfeng, and Gao Yijing received first-class merits. I received the title of Second-Class Combat Hero. I also received a North Korean "First-Class National Flag Medal" and a "Second-Class Freedom and Independence Medal."

    The great People's Democratic Constitution draft has been announced. It was written with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. It is the crystallization of the martyrs' sacrifices. It is like a flower blooming in the Motherland. Let us jointly cheer and celebrate this unprecedented great event for the Motherland!

    At the same time, I also assure the people of the Motherland that we Volunteer Army Air Force soldiers will definitely use practical actions to support the draft constitution, be highly vigilant against the US imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, and strive to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction and the bright and happy socialist future. If the enemy dares to take risks, all of us comrades will use the new strength given to us by the draft constitution to give the enemy a double blow. Please rest assured, people of the Motherland.

### 宪法草案给了我们新的力量

    宪法草案给了我们新的力量
    志愿军空军二级战斗英雄　郑长华亲爱的祖国人民：
    我们远离祖国的志愿军空军战士们，是多么渴望知道祖国的情形啊，不论在过去战斗的空隙和现在学习的余暇，我们总有收听祖国广播的习惯，祖国的任何成就，都会直接变成鼓舞我们的力量。
    六月十四日这天，经过一天紧张地学习，我照例打开收音机收听祖国的消息。怎么？今天的前奏曲不是“新民主主义进行曲”，而是国歌了，我心想：一定有重要的消息啦。果然不错，国歌刚刚奏完，扩音器里就传出了广播员异常兴奋的声音：
  “……中央人民政府委员会在十四日下午举行第三十次会议，一致通过了‘中华人民共和国宪法草案’。会议由毛泽东主席主持……”这时候，我的心情是多么激动啊！我屏住气息，聚精会神地听着广播员宣读宪法草案的全文，我一面听一面想……
    特别当我听到关于“公民的基本权利和义务”那一章的时候，我不由得想起了旧社会，想起了我那贫困的家，想起了我那一辈子受尽地主阶级压迫剥削毫无生活权利的老父亲，他直到死，自己没有一垅土地，他给地主郑长方佃种土地二十年，可是死了连个埋葬自己的地方都没有，父亲出殡的那天，善良的母亲曾向地主去哀求，幻想地主会看在父亲为他种地二十年的情分上，给父亲个地头做坟地，可是地主只冷笑了一声，就把母亲推出了门。可怜的父亲，只好埋在乱坟岗上。在旧社会像我父亲这样苦难的劳动人民不是成千成万吗？而旧社会的法律对劳动人民的生活权利是毫无保障的！回忆过去，看看现在，想想将来，这就不能不使我为全中国劳动人民能够得到宪法草案中所规定的劳动权、休息权、物质帮助等权利而万分高兴。可是，我又想：这宪法草案的产生是多么不易啊！它里面凝结了多少革命先烈的生命和血汗啊！
    听完广播，已是夜深了，可是广播员的声音一直回旋在我的脑子里，兴奋的心情使我难以入睡。我在回忆着党和毛主席领导祖国人民过去所经历的艰苦斗争的道路，回忆着那些为了祖国而献出了自己生命的战友们。我永远不能忘记和我一起生活过战斗过的卢排长。那是一九四八年的春天，在围攻临汾的激烈战斗中，他受了重伤，他在临牺牲前，怀着对革命事业无限惜别的心情对我说：“指导员，我不能为党工作了，全国还有许多地方的人民受着压迫，解放他们的任务，只有留给你们了！”今天，在宪法草案公布的日子，我不能不为这临停止呼吸前还关心着全国人民解放的亲密的战友表示深切的怀念。
    这天晚上，我也忆起了在艰苦抗日战争的时期那些至今难忘的战斗情景。那时我在新四军一个连里当支部书记，每次的战斗，每次的胜利，都付出相当的代价，而共产党员的牺牲数量，往往大于群众，每逢有伤亡，都会使我从内心感到痛惜和难过。但是，每当我冷静下来一想：要革命就会有牺牲流血，一切为祖国献出生命的人们，将来总会有报偿的时候，我就首先抑制自己对牺牲的战友的痛惜心情，并号召共产党员和全连战士，把悲痛化为力量，继续跟敌人战斗。多少为祖国献出生命的烈士们啊！如今真算得到了伟大的报偿。
    今天，我更不能忘记在朝鲜的那些艰苦的战斗，抗美援朝运动展开以后，我抱着帮助朝鲜人民打败侵略者，保卫祖国建设，保卫人民革命胜利果实的决心参加了志愿军，我和我的战友们，由于对祖国的爱，对敌人的恨，就使我们在和美国空中强盗作战中，产生了无穷的智慧和力量。记得一九五三年一月的一次战斗中，我们的机群正在朝鲜天空巡逻，突然，得到三倍于我们的敌机正采取三面包围的队形向北朝鲜扑来的报告。这时，我心里盘算着：狡猾的敌人是采用“口袋”战术了，如果分路迎击，力量不够；打敌一路，又会遭到另两路敌人的袭击，应当寻找敌人的弱点。经过这短暂的考虑，我就果断地率领机群，向中路敌人迎头冲过去。敌人被我们这种勇猛的突然的动作吓住了，慌忙向旁边躲闪，敌机队形也乱了，在这一瞬间，我从耳机中听到地面指挥员下达了“抓住敌机弱点，狠狠地打”的命令，于是我立即指挥全队猛地把机头拨转回来，向敌机编队的右翼猛攻过去。开初，敌人还企图利用它数量上的优势摆脱被动向我们反扑，但是，我们绝不能让敌人恢复主动，我指挥着机群采用了小编队向混乱的敌机进行了好几次猛烈的攻击，结果，胜利地粉碎了敌人合击的阴谋，并击落了三架敌机。
    在每次完成飞行出击任务返回机场后，我经常这样想，在空中作战不同于地面，每一分钟不知要穿过多少云朵越过多少高山，一场战斗的胜利，往往是在紧张地分秒钟里决定。我怎样能够把祖国交给的任务完成得更好呢？每个夜晚我都为这个问题苦思着。
    一天，政治委员对我说：“祖国人民把支援朝鲜人民，保卫祖国建设打击美国空中强盗的光荣任务交给我们了。做一个空军指挥员，要善于总结战斗经验，并把大家的智慧集中起来，再用它来指导大家行动。必须记住，飞行员的勇敢和智慧，是要依靠你的正确指挥在战斗中体现和发挥的。”这些深刻的启示，在我身上产生了无穷的力量，依照这个正确的作战指导思想，有了祖国和朝鲜人民大力的支援，我们这支空军部队，从一九五二年八月到一九五三年三月，就击落击伤敌机四十七架。我自己亲手打掉敌机两架。我们部队集体立了二等功，在飞行员中，李兰茂、姜龙亭、唐彦峰、高义敬四人立了一等功。我得到了二级战斗英雄的称号。又得到了一枚朝鲜“一级国旗勋章”和一枚“二级自由独立勋章”。
    伟大的人民民主宪法草案公布了，这是革命先烈们用鲜血写成的，这是先烈们流血牺牲的结晶，它像一朵鲜花在祖国开放了。让我们共同为祖国这件空前未有的大喜事而欢呼庆祝吧！
    同时，我还向祖国人民保证，我们志愿军空军的战士们，一定以实际行动来拥护宪法草案，高度警惕美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋，为保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果和美好幸福的社会主义前途而奋斗。如果敌人敢于冒险，我们全体同志将用宪法草案给我们的新的力量，给敌人以双倍的打击。请祖国人民放心。（附图片）
