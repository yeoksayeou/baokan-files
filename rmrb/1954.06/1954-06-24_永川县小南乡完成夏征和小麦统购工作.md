Xiaonan Township, Yongchuan County Completes Summer Grain Tax and Unified Wheat Purchase
The farmers of Xiaonan Township, District One, Yongchuan County, Sichuan Province, enthusiastically paid their summer grain tax and actively followed the state's policy of unified grain purchase, selling their surplus wheat to the state. By May 22nd, the township's farmers had collectively delivered the summer grain tax and the state-planned wheat purchase to the state granary. The entire township paid over 46,000 catties of summer grain tax and sold over 35,000 catties of wheat to the state. Before the grain was put into storage, the farmers in each village sun-dried and winnowed the wheat, ensuring it was "dried and clean."

The township's summer grain tax and unified wheat purchase work were closely integrated with production from beginning to end. At the beginning of the work, it was the busy season for rice transplanting. The working cadres helped farmers promote the advanced experience of sparse planting with fewer seedlings. Necessary meetings were held in the evenings in small groups or during the farmers' lunch break in the fields for deliberation and discussion, ensuring that farmers had sufficient time for production, which allowed the township's rice transplanting work to be completed ahead of schedule. At the same time, they also helped mutual aid teams and individual farmers solve some problems and difficulties in production. With the help of the working cadres, the Luo Yincheng mutual aid team solved the problems of labor arrangement, score evaluation, and animal power, and successfully completed the rice transplanting task. The team members actively discussed the summer grain tax and unified wheat purchase, and in addition to paying the grain tax in a timely manner, they also sold 1,160 catties of wheat.

    永川县小南乡完成夏征和小麦统购工作
    四川省永川县第一区小南乡农民踊跃缴纳夏征公粮，积极遵照国家统购粮食的政策，把多余的小麦卖给国家。到五月二十二日，全乡农民即将夏征公粮和国家计划收购的小麦集体送入国家粮库。全乡共缴夏征公粮四万六千多斤，卖给国家小麦三万五千多斤。在粮食入库以前，各村农民还纷纷风、晒小麦，作到了“晒干扬净”。
    该乡夏征和统购小麦工作，从头到尾都紧密结合生产进行。工作开始时，正是插秧的紧张时期，工作干部就帮助农民推广少秧密植的先进经验，必要的会议也都在晚上分点联组召开，或者利用中午农民休息的时间在田间酝酿讨论，保证农民有充分的时间进行生产，使该乡插秧工作能提前完成。同时在这个期间，还帮助互助组和个体农民解决了生产中的一些问题和困难。罗银成互助组在工作干部帮助下，将排工、评分及畜力方面的问题解决以后，顺利完成了插秧任务；组员们积极讨论了夏征和统购小麦的问题，除及时缴纳公粮外，还卖出小麦一千一百六十斤。
