The Life of a Kazakh Hunter
By Shao Rui, Our Correspondent

As we were rapidly riding our horses across the grasslands of the Altai Mountains, we rounded a bend in the mountain, and in front of us appeared several tents and a flock of sheep covering the mountains and plains. As we were already galloping past the flock, amidst the barking of several dogs, onto a hillside, we suddenly heard someone shouting repeatedly from behind. Turning back, we saw an old man walking out of a tent, waving his arms urgently and shouting, "Yoldas (Comrade), sit for a while..." This scene made the local ethnic cadre who was leading us and eager to hurry on, rein in his horse and turn back, saying, "If we don't go down and sit for a while, this old man will be very upset!" Then he explained: this is a manifestation of the Kazakh people's warm welcome to the Communist Party and the cadres of the People's Government after liberation, a stark contrast to the past when they would hide in fear upon seeing the officials of the Kuomintang reactionaries from afar.

So we dismounted and walked towards the tent in front. Many of the dogs in the flock had already been chased away by their owner, and everyone's horses were led over and tied to wooden stakes in front of the tent. As soon as we entered the tent, before we could even greet him, the old man said humorously, "As soon as I heard the sound of horses' hooves outside, I knew that distinguished guests must be passing by, and when I went out to look, I was right!" His words made everyone laugh. This seventy-year-old Kazakh man, with a round face and broad shoulders, appeared strong and robust. His eyes twinkled as he looked at each of us, and his voice was as loud as a bronze bell. On the wooden frame to the right of the tent were two large eagles staring around with their round eyes, and the two slender dogs lying outside the tent entrance were also constantly pricking up their ears and looking inside, as if they were all waiting for the old man to set off for the hunt. It turned out that he was the famous old hunter, Alibai.

He told us with great interest about his experience in hunting wolves. Just by looking at the footprints of a wolf, he could judge whether it had passed by yesterday or today, morning or evening. This allowed him to immediately decide on the method of tracking and hunting the wolf. The hunting group he led was the best performing group among the eleven hunting groups in the entire district. At that time, a total of forty-three wolves were killed in the entire district, averaging less than four per group, while Alibai's group alone killed thirteen. The news of this victory in wolf hunting spread everywhere, because it was a great contribution to pastoral production. The dreaded wolves often broke into the sheep flocks, killing dozens of sheep in one go. For many years, wolf damage had been a terrible disaster for the pastoral people. After liberation, the People's Government attached great importance to the problem of eliminating wolves, regarding it as a particularly important task in the pastoral areas. Eliminating wolves not only reduced the loss of livestock, but was also a good sideline production that could increase the income of the herdsmen. Therefore, the herdsmen actively responded to the government's call and formed many hunting groups.

Alibai's group had a total of fifteen people, making it a relatively strong force. Each time they hunted, when using two slender dogs, they needed four other people riding four horses to cooperate. If they used two eagles, they needed eight people riding eight horses to cooperate, so that when these eagles and dogs were running after wolves and foxes, people could take turns riding horses to follow! Otherwise, after they caught the wolves and foxes, they would quickly tear the fur with their mouths and claws, turning the originally valuable A'shan fur into worthless scraps. Alibai's two eagles caught twenty-five foxes last winter. An ordinary fox skin was worth several hundred thousand yuan Renminbi, and a rare black fox skin could be exchanged for several sheep. As he spoke, Alibai asked people to bring over wolf skins and hang fox skins for everyone to see. He smiled, squinting his eyes, and said: this can be exchanged for so many sheep!

Speaking of sheep, he seemed to remember something. Then, he told us about his experience in developing his sheep flock: When his father was alive, his family had only one horse, five camels, and fifteen sheep. Later, after decades of hard work, Alibai's livestock had grown to more than a thousand head. At this point, the old man suddenly sighed sadly. He said: I never thought that decades of hard work would be wiped out in a few dozen days! In 1946, when the Usman bandits rebelled, they were even more terrible than wolves, and they drove away all the sheep at once, and even drove people around like livestock. When they were taken to Qinggeler in the eastern part of the Altai Mountains, he lost more than five hundred sheep in one go. What made him even more heartbroken was that he lost another hundred breeding rams and his four beloved horses.

"After liberation, the People's Government first captured and suppressed Usman, the big, harmful wolf," the old man Alibai suddenly regained his cheerful spirit and said excitedly. "Then, they came up with many good ways to organize production for the people, such as hunting groups, firewood gathering groups, fishing groups, salt digging groups, and alkali digging groups. These were things that never existed before." Alibai said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there are really many methods. Since then, Alibai has relied on his past hunting experience and adopted new methods of collective hunting, actively taking the lead and organizing hunting groups with everyone, often riding horses with everyone on the grasslands and forests of the Altai Mountains.

Now, Alibai has restored and developed his flock from the remaining few hundred sheep to more than fifteen hundred. His cattle have grown from the original five to fifty-two, and his horses have grown from forty to one hundred and twenty-five. All told, there are almost two thousand. At first, it sounds strange; how could it develop so quickly: the speed of development in just a few years has exceeded the speed of development in the past few decades. But Alibai understands very well: in the past, when he worked alone, he could not take care of everything. Now that everyone works together, not only is the grazing better, but the hunting is also more efficient. In addition, the price of fur has greatly increased, and the taxes have been reduced... Many aspects have helped the development of the sheep flock.

In the spring of 1953, the A'shan Special District (now the Altay Special District) held a pastoral area symposium, and he was invited to participate because he had made great achievements in developing livestock. After returning, he became even more enthusiastic. In May, he responded to the government's call and implemented the method of isolating sick sheep, and in July, he implemented the method of selecting rams for breeding. He held up his hands and said: The policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government are right! Responding to the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the sheep flock will develop even more in the future. As he spoke, he became even more excited, and his voice rang out like a bronze bell: "With Chairman Mao, I am not afraid of anything, I firmly support the Communist Party and the People's Government! If anyone dares to oppose it, I will dare to beat him!"

Finally, we took out a "Northwest Pictorial" with a picture of Chairman Mao printed on it and gave it to Alibai. He held it in both hands and cheered "Ah, ah."

    一个哈萨克猎人的生活
    本报记者　邵锐
    我们正骑着马在阿勒太山的草原上迅速前进的时候，拐过一个山湾，前面出现了几顶帐篷和一片漫山遍野的羊群。当我们已经在几只狗的嘶咬声中，从羊群旁边跃马奔上一道山坡时，忽听得背后有人连声喊叫，一回头看见从帐篷里走出一位老头子，他急急地摇晃着手臂喊叫着：“约勒达士（同志），坐一坐……”这情景使得在前面引着我们急于赶路的当地民族干部，也只好勒住马缰回过头来说：“如果不下去坐一坐，这老头子心里可要很难过啊！”接着他又解释说：这就是解放后哈萨克人对共产党和人民政府干部热情欢迎的一种表现，和以前远远地望见国民党反动派的官儿，就吓得连忙躲藏起来的情景是大不相同了。
    我们于是跳下马来，走向前面的帐篷去。羊群里的许多狗早都被主人赶走了，大家的马也都被拉过去拴在帐篷跟前的木橛上。刚一走进帐篷，还没有等我们问好，这位老头子就有趣地说：“忽听得外面马蹄响，就觉得这一定是贵客路过，出去一看，果然不错！”他的话引得大家一齐笑起来。这位七十多岁的哈萨克老人，圆形的大脸，宽阔的肩膀，显得身体很健壮魁梧，眼睛闪闪烁烁地看看这个又看看那个，说话的声音像铜钟一般响。帐篷里靠右边的木架上有两只大鹰一直在瞪着圆圆的眼睛东瞧西望，帐篷口外卧着的两只细狗也不时竖起耳朵向里面观看，好像都是在等待着这个老头子出发去打猎。原来他就是有名的老猎人阿勒拜。
    他很有兴趣地向我们讲了打狼的经验，只要他看看狼走过的脚印，就能判断这狼是昨天或今天，早上或晚上从这儿走过的。这样就能立刻决定跟踪打狼的方法。他领导的打猎小组是全区十一个打猎小组中成绩最好的一个组；当时全区共打狼四十三只，平均每组还不到四只，而阿勒拜这一组就打了十三只。到处都在传颂着这打狼的捷报，因为这对牧区生产是一种很大的功绩。平常那可怕的恶狼，不时闯到羊群里，一股劲就会咬死几十只羊，多少年来，狼害一直是牧区人民的一种很可怕的灾害。解放后，人民政府很重视除狼害的问题，把它看做牧区一件特别重要的工作。除狼害不仅能够减少牲口的损失，同时也是一种很好的副业生产，可以增加牧民的收入。所以牧民都积极响应政府的号召，组成了不少打猎小组。
    阿勒拜这一组共有十五个人，是力量比较雄厚的。每次打猎使用两只细狗时，要另有四个人骑着四匹马配合出发，如果使用两只鹰时，更要有八个人骑着八匹马配合出发。以便当这些鹰犬们飞跑着追赶狼狐时，有人轮替着骑马跟随前去！不然，等它们抓住狼狐之后，很快就会用嘴和爪把兽皮撕得破烂，使那本来是很名贵的阿山皮也会变成不值钱的东西了。阿勒拜的两只鹰去年一冬抓了二十五只狐狸，一只普通狐皮值几十万元人民币，另有一种很名贵的黑狐皮，一张就可以换来几只羊。说着说着阿勒拜就叫人取来一张张的狼皮摆在地上，一挂挂的狐皮提在手里请大家看。他笑得眯着眼睛说：这又可以换来多少羊啊！
    一提到羊，他好像想起了一些什么问题。接着，他向我们讲了他发展羊群的经过：当他父亲在世时，他家中只有一匹马、五峰骆驼和十五只羊。后来，经过他几十年的辛勤劳动，阿勒拜的畜群发展到了一千多头。说到这里，这老头子忽然很悲伤地叹了一口气，他说：想不到几十年的辛苦在几十天的工夫就弄完了！一九四六年当乌斯满匪徒叛乱时，比恶狼还厉害，一下子把羊全给吆走了，连人也像牲口一样被到处吆着跑。当把他们裹胁到阿勒太山东部青格勒时，一次就搞掉他五百多只羊；更使他伤心的是又一次抢去他一百多只配种的公羊和他最心爱的四匹马。
    “解放后，人民政府先把乌斯满这只害人的大恶狼活捉住镇压了。”阿勒拜老头子忽然又恢复了他那愉快的精神兴奋地说，“接着又给人民群众想了许多组织生产的好办法，什么打猎小组、打柴小组、打鱼小组、挖盐小组、挖碱小组，这些都是以前根本没有的。”阿勒拜说：在共产党和毛主席的领导下，办法真是多得很。自从那时起，阿勒拜也就一面凭着自己过去打猎的经验，一面采用了集体打猎的新办法，很积极地带头和大家在一起组织了打猎小组，经常和大家骑马奔跑在阿勒太山的草原上和森林里。
    现在，阿勒拜已经从残余的几百只羊恢复发展到一千五百多只了。他的牛也从原来的五头发展到五十二头，马从四十匹发展到一百二十五匹。全部都算上，差不多就有两千多了。最初听了使人感到很奇怪；怎么能发展这样快：短短几年的工夫竟超过了过去几十年发展的速度；但阿勒拜心里很明白：以前自己一个人干，顾了这头顾不了那头，现在大家在一起干，不仅牧放得好，打猎也打得多打得快；加上兽皮的价格大大提高了，而税收却减轻了……。许多方面都帮助了羊群的发展。
    一九五三年春天，阿山专区（即今阿勒泰专区）召开了牧区座谈会，因为他发展牲畜很有成绩，也被请去参加了。回来后，就更加起劲了。五月间，他响应了政府的号召，实行了病羊隔离的办法，七月间又实行挑选公羊配种的办法。他捧起两手说：共产党和人民政府的政策就是对！响应共产党和人民政府的号召，以后羊群发展得更要大。说着说着他更兴奋起来了，他的声音又像铜钟似的洪亮地响起来：“有了毛主席，我什么也不怕，我是坚决拥护共产党和人民政府的！如果有谁敢反对的话，我就敢揍他！”
    最后，我们拿出一份印有毛主席像的“西北画报”送给阿勒拜。他双手捧着“啊啊”地欢呼了起来。
