    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 17th. The London "Daily Worker" published a commentary on the 17th, commenting on the bellicose clamoring issued by the Rhee Syngman regime's Foreign Minister Pyun Yung-tai at a press conference the day after the breakdown of discussions on the Korean issue -- clamoring that seemed to be dictated by his American masters. The newspaper said: "The South Korean representatives, headed by Pyun Yung-tai, do not hide their happiness over the failure of the Geneva Conference and the fact that the foreign ministers have signed the shameless document dictated by Dulles and Rhee Syngman... The Western countries' actions to undermine peace negotiations in Korea have achieved preliminary results: Pyun Yung-tai has openly declared the cancellation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and demanded 'complete freedom of action' to unify Korea."
      "The Daily Worker" continued: "Pyun Yung-tai told reporters that the failure of the Geneva Conference was tantamount to 'destroying the armistice agreement,' and 'we no longer consider ourselves bound by it.'"
      "The Daily Worker" pointed out: "This warmongering rhetoric once again illustrates why the American representative Smith opposed Molotov's proposal last night for both sides to guarantee not to resume hostilities."
      The "Daily Herald," referring to Pyun Yung-tai's remarks, said: "South Korea's threat to resume military operations has shocked the representatives attending the Geneva Conference." The "Daily Herald" also said: "He (Pyun Yung-tai) was asked whether the whole world would rather have another war than more negotiations, to which he replied: 'You can draw your own conclusions. If I answer this question, you will call me a warmonger.'"
      Xinhua News Agency, June 18th. The day after the United States broke off discussions on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference, Rhee Syngman regime representative Pyun Yung-tai issued a call for war at a press conference on the 16th, declaring that the South Korean government no longer considered itself obligated to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement and would be free to take any action it pleased. The United States delegation at the Geneva Conference even refused to undertake the minimum obligation to guarantee that peace in Korea would not be threatened. Pyun Yung-tai's clamor is a further expression of this attitude of the United States. The United States is obviously harboring such a conspiracy: after dragging its "allies" participating in the Korean War to break off negotiations on a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, it is attempting to choose a time to once again use the Rhee Syngman clique to drag these "allies" into a new adventure.
    According to a Reuters dispatch from Geneva, Pyun Yung-tai's clamoring caused deep shock and unease among the representatives of many of America's "allies." The representatives said they were shocked that Pyun Yung-tai's statement was made less than twenty-four hours after the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue ended at the initiative of the United States and its "allies." One representative said that Pyun Yung-tai's statement was contrary to the mood of the people. The Reuters dispatch also said that it was generally believed that Pyun Yung-tai's remarks might prompt public opinion in some countries to express opposition to keeping troops in Korea.

    英国报纸斥卞荣泰的好战叫嚷
    【新华社日内瓦十七日电】伦敦“工人日报”十七日发表评论，评论李承晚政权外务部长官卞荣泰在关于朝鲜问题的讨论破裂后第二天在记者招待会上发出的好战叫嚣——看来这些叫嚣是他的美国主子们指使的。这家报纸说：“以卞荣泰为首的南朝鲜代表们并不隐瞒他们对于日内瓦会议失败以及外长们已在杜勒斯和李承晚口授的无耻文件上签字一事感到高兴……西方国家破坏朝鲜和平谈判的行动已经收到了初步效果：卞荣泰已公开宣告取消朝鲜停战协定，并要求有‘完全的行动自由’来统一朝鲜。”
      “工人日报”继续说：“卞荣泰告诉记者们说，日内瓦会议失败等于‘破坏了停战协定’，‘我们不再认为我们自己仍被它所约束’。”
      “工人日报”指出：“这种好战言论再一次说明了：美国代表史密斯昨晚为什么要反对莫洛托夫提出的双方保证不恢复敌对行动的建议。”
      “每日先驱报”谈到卞荣泰的言论时说：“南朝鲜的恢复军事行动的威胁使得参加日内瓦会议的代表们感到震惊。”“每日先驱报”又说：“有人问他（卞荣泰）说，是否全世界会宁愿再来进行一次战争而不愿进行更多的谈判，他回答说：‘你可以随便得出你自己的结论，假如我回答这个问题，你就会叫我是战争贩子。’”
      【新华社十八日讯】在美国破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论的第二天，李承晚政权代表卞荣泰十六日就在记者招待会上发出战争的叫嚣，宣称南朝鲜政府不再认为它有义务遵守朝鲜停战协定，而将自由采取它高兴采取的任何行动。美国代表团在日内瓦会议上甚至拒绝承担保证朝鲜和平不受威胁的起码义务，卞荣泰的叫嚣就是美国这种态度的进一步表白。美国显然怀着这样的阴谋：在拖着它的参加侵朝战争的“盟国”一道破裂关于和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判后，企图选择时机再度利用李承晚集团来把这些“盟国”拖入新冒险。
    据路透社日内瓦消息报道，卞荣泰的叫嚣使美国的许多“盟国”的代表深感震惊和不安。代表们说，他们感到震惊的是，卞荣泰的声明是在日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论在美国和它的“盟国”的创议下结束后不到二十四小时发表的。一位代表说，卞荣泰的声明是和人们的情绪相抵触的。路透社消息并说，人们普遍认为，卞荣泰这种言论可能促使某些国家的舆论表示反对把军队继续留在朝鲜。
