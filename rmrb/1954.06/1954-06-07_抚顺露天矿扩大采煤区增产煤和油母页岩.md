Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 5th. The Fushun Mining Bureau's open-pit mine will gradually expand its mining area this year to increase the production of raw coal and oil shale. Electric shovel operators are now driving powerful electric shovels across the old mining boundary line on the north side of the open-pit mine, entering a residential area that was recently established to open up new coal mining areas. The construction of the electric tram line project, which is planned to be more than thirty kilometers long this year, is also under intense construction or surveying work.

The Fushun open-pit mine has a history of forty years of mining. The open-pit mining area is more than 6,000 meters long from east to west and more than 1,000 meters wide from north to south. Last year, the raw coal produced by the open-pit mine accounted for more than 37% of the total raw coal output of the Fushun Mining Bureau, and it also produced millions of tons of oil shale, ensuring the raw material needs of the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1. This year, the planned coal production of the open-pit mine will increase by 33% compared with last year. In terms of the supply of oil shale, although the Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 has improved the oil extraction rate of oil shale, saving a lot of oil shale, the supply of oil shale this year has still increased by 13% compared with last year due to the large-scale Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 2 putting some crude oil equipment into production. The existing mining scale of the open-pit mine can no longer adapt to this new situation. Therefore, the mining boundary line of the open-pit mine must first be extended by 30 meters to 60 meters to the north this year, and the mining area will continue to be expanded in the next few years in order to increase the production of raw coal and oil shale to meet the needs of China's growing industry and transportation industry.

Expanding the mining area of the open-pit mine is a very large and complex project. This project has brought unprecedented changes to the open-pit mine in forty years. In order to rapidly expand the mining area, more than 260 residents living north of the western mining boundary line of the open-pit mine have moved into new homes, and the housing area has been demolished. In early June, when all of the more than 100 new houses are completed, more than 1,000 residents will have to move away so that the open-pit mine can further expand the mining area. Due to the expansion of the mining area of the open-pit mine, some tram lines, high-voltage power lines, telephone lines, highways, culverts and drainage ditches inside and outside the open-pit mining area and in the urban area of Fushun City must be relocated or newly built, and the amount of earth excavation and filling alone is more than one million cubic meters. In order to ensure the completion of these urgent and technically complex projects on schedule, the open-pit mine has transferred a deputy mine director and a deputy chief engineer to strengthen the leadership of these projects.

### 抚顺露天矿扩大采煤区增产煤和油母页岩

    抚顺露天矿扩大采煤区增产煤和油母页岩
    【新华社抚顺五日电】抚顺矿务局露天矿今年将逐步扩大开采范围，增产原煤和油母页岩。现在，电铲司机已经驾驶着效力强大的电铲，越过露天矿北面古老的开采境界线，进入不久以前的住宅区开辟新的采煤区了。今年计划移设和新建的总长达三十多公里的电车线路工程，也正在紧张施工或进行勘测工作。
    抚顺露天矿已有四十年的开采历史。露天采煤区东西长六千多公尺、南北宽一千多公尺。去年，露天矿产的原煤已占抚顺矿务局原煤总产量的百分之三十七以上，并出产了数以百万吨计的油母页岩，保证了东北石油一厂的原料需要。今年，露天矿的计划产煤量比去年增长了百分之三十三。在油母页岩的供应方面，虽然东北石油一厂提高了油母页岩的出油率，节省了很多油母页岩，但由于规模宏大的东北石油二厂的部分原油设备投入生产，今年油母页岩的供应量仍比去年增加了百分之十三。这一任务按照露天矿现有的开采规模，已经不能适应这种新的情况。因此，露天矿的开采境界线，必须在今年首先向北伸展三十公尺到六十公尺，并在今后数年内继续扩大开采范围，以便增产更多的原煤和油母页岩，满足我国日益增长的工业和交通运输业的需要。
    扩大露天矿的开采范围，是一项非常浩大而又复杂的工程。这项工程给露天矿带来了四十年以来不曾有过的变化。为了迅速扩大开采范围，住在露天矿西部开采境界线以北的二百六十多户居民迁入新居，那片住房已被拆除。六月初，当一百多栋新住宅全部完工后，还有一千多户居民要迁走，使露天矿能够进一步扩大开采范围。由于露天矿开采范围的扩大，露天采煤区内外和抚顺市市区的部分电车线路、高压电线、电话线、公路、涵洞和排水沟等，都必须移设或新建，其中单是挖土和填土的数量就有一百多万立方公尺。为了保证按期完成这些时间紧迫、技术复杂的工程，露天矿已抽调一个副矿长和一个副主任工程师加强对这些工程的领导工作。
