    East China's oil industry is striving to increase edible oil production by 75 million jin by the end of this year, using the raw material quantities specified in the original annual plan. All oil factories will use improved technology to increase oil yield to achieve this goal.
    Since last year, many oil factories in East China have worked hard to learn advanced oil pressing methods from the Soviet Union and the Northeast, and the oil yield has significantly improved. Since the first quarter of this year, twenty-seven factories with relatively good work, such as Qingdao No. 2 Vegetable Oil Factory, Nanjing Oil Pressing Factory, and Wuhu Oil Pressing Factory, have achieved an average oil yield increase of 2.48 percent compared to last year. In Shandong Province, the oil yield of each oil factory processing oil materials for the state has generally increased. According to statistics from the China Oil and Fat Company Shandong Province Company, in April, every 10 million jin of soybeans processed yielded more than 200,000 jin of edible oil than last year, and every 10 million jin of peanut kernels processed yielded more than 160,000 jin of edible oil than last year. Therefore, if calculated according to the same quantity of oil crops processed this year as last year, the edible oil production can be increased by at least more than 10 million jin this year. The Wuxi Oil Cake Factory of the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative adopted the "two-baking, one-rolling" method proposed by worker Li Jinlin to replace the past method of first rolling and then steaming, increasing the oil yield per hundred jin of soybeans by two to two and seven tenths jin, which can increase soybean oil production by 2.5 million jin in ten months.
    However, because the equipment and operation methods of the various oil factories in East China are different, the oil yield varies greatly. Some of the more advanced oil factories can yield 14 jin of oil per hundred jin of soybeans, while some oil factories can only yield seven or eight jin. The oil content of one hundred jin of soybeans is about eighteen jin. In order to enable all factories to generally increase the oil yield, the East China Administrative Committee Local Industry Bureau held a technical experience exchange meeting for the oil industry at the end of May and early June. Now, thirty oil factories have increased the oil yield targets for the third quarter based on the experience of advanced factories and their own conditions, and these targets are on average 1.4 percent higher than the current ones. Small factories in Anhui Province that use indigenous methods for oil pressing are also promoting the Northeast's Li Chuanjiang oil pressing operation method. According to calculations by factories that have successfully tested it, the soybean oil yield can be increased by about 20 percent. From the third quarter onwards, the East China Administrative Committee Local Industry Bureau will also lead the establishment of technical guidance stations and promotion stations in various places, absorb experienced employees to serve as technical guides, help oil factories with low oil yields to improve oil pressing technology, and generally increase the oil yield of various oil materials under the condition of ensuring quality.

### 华东油脂工业争取增产食油七千多万斤

    华东油脂工业争取增产食油七千多万斤
    【新华社上海电】华东区油脂工业争取到今年年底用原来年度计划中规定的原料数量，增产七千五百万斤食油。各油厂都将用改进技术，提高出油率的方法来达到这个目标。
    从去年以来，华东区许多油厂努力学习苏联和东北的先进榨油法以后，出油率有显著提高。青岛第二植物油厂、南京榨油厂、芜湖榨油厂等二十七个工作比较好的厂，今年第一季度以来各种油料的出油率平均比去年提高百分之二点四八。山东省为国家加工油料的各油厂，今年的出油率普遍提高。据中国油脂公司山东省公司统计，四月份每加工一千万斤大豆，比去年多收入二十多万斤食油，每加工一千万斤花生仁，比去年多收入十六万多斤食油；因此，如果按照今年加工油料作物和去年相同的数量来计算，今年最低可以增产食油一千多万斤。江苏省合作总社无锡油饼厂采用了工人李金林提出的“两烘一轧”工作法，代替过去的先轧后蒸的方法，使每百斤大豆出油率提高二斤到二斤七两，十个月就能增产豆油二百五十万斤。
    但是华东区各个油厂因为设备和操作方法不同，所以出油率的高低相差还是很大的。有些比较先进的油厂每百斤大豆能出油十四斤，有些油厂只能出七八斤。而一百斤大豆的含油量有十八斤左右。为了使各厂普遍提高出油率，华东行政委员会地方工业局在五月底六月初召开了一个油脂工业交流技术经验的会议。现在已有三十个油厂根据先进厂的经验和本厂的情况，提高了第三季度的出油指标，这些指标平均比现在提高百分之一点四。安徽省用土法榨油的小厂也在推行东北的李川江榨油操作法，据已试验成功的厂计算，大豆出油率能提高百分之二十左右。从第三季度起，华东行政委员会地方工业局并将领导各地建立技术指导站、推广站，吸收有经验的职工担任技术指导，帮助出油率低的油厂改进榨油技术，在保证质量的条件下普遍提高各种油料的出油率。
