    80,000 Kilometers

    Driver Yang Yonghu's preliminary ideal has been realized.
    On the evening of April 29, 1954, amidst a drizzle, he safely drove a "GAZ-51" truck, reaching a mileage of 80,000 kilometers, setting the highest record for safe driving mileage for trucks on the Korean battlefield in the past three years.
    Anyone who has been to Korea will deeply understand the importance of truck transportation for the Korean people's war against aggression. As Yang Yonghu himself said: "The highway is like a blood vessel, and the truck is the circulating blood." And Yang Yonghu himself is one who has made outstanding contributions to the war effort through transportation.
    One night in 1952, Yang Yonghu and his comrades were loading shells at a depot warehouse that was often blockaded by enemy aircraft and located right next to the railway and highway. Comrades at the depot told them: "Leave here quickly after loading, the enemy planes will be here in less than five minutes." At that time, Yang Yonghu's truck was at the end of the line, and just as it was his turn to load, a train full of shells stopped nearby. Immediately afterward, enemy planes arrived overhead and dropped a large number of bombs. By the time Yang Yonghu finished loading, the other trucks had already left the danger zone. At this point, the flames of the exploding bombs illuminated the surroundings, clearly exposing his truck in the light. Yang Yonghu's truck was in a very critical situation, and he had to leave immediately; otherwise, if the enemy planes turned back, they would immediately spot it, or the exploding shells on the train would hit the shells on his truck. In that case, not only would his truck be destroyed, but tens of thousands of shells in the warehouse would also be in danger of being completely destroyed. Depot personnel urged him to turn around quickly and hide nearby, because there was still time to hide. However, when he thought that if he hid, he would not be able to transport the shells to the front line that night, and when he thought about how the front-line troops needed the support of these shells, he braved the greatest danger and drove the truck full of shells, rushing out of the danger zone in one go, and completed the task of transporting the shells.
    From January to April 1953, the transportation tasks on the Korean front lines were extremely arduous. Yang Yonghu's truck was particularly busy during this period. As soon as it got dark, his truck would appear on the highway. From the depot to the position, Yang Yonghu would stop his truck and run out of the cab like a gust of wind, carrying the wooden boxes he loaded or unloaded, shouting: "Hey! Load quickly, try to finish in ten minutes!" or: "Come on! Unload together, try to make another trip before dawn!" This energetic young man, who never seemed to know fatigue, brought great encouragement to the loaders at the depot and the soldiers at the position. After a night of intense work, he didn't seem to feel tired at all, always cheerful and excited. Because every time he completed a transportation task, he seemed to see the soldiers using the ammunition he transported to strike the enemy, as if he could hear the soldiers in the tunnels reading the newspapers and letters he transported aloud, or eating the food supported by the people of the motherland. At this time, all his fatigue was replaced by a feeling of joy. Sometimes, he recited the words of the Soviet hero Matrosov to himself: "The trust of comrades, the trust of the motherland—for a person, this is the greatest reward."
    In this way, he completed six months of transportation tasks in four months. He continuously received the "Pioneer" red flag three times, and became a glorious member of the New Democratic Youth League.
    In such arduous and tense transportation tasks, how did he achieve 80,000 kilometers of safe driving? This is because he cherished his truck. He said: "Cherishing the truck is cherishing the motherland, cherishing the people, fulfilling your duty to the motherland, and being responsible to the people." In two years and five months, his truck has not undergone a major or intermediate repair, and there has not been a single accident. Even a single tool has not been lost, as the party branch secretary Li Ruiquan said: "He cherishes the truck more than he cherishes himself. If the quilt is torn, he can not mend it that day, if his face is dirty, he can not wash it immediately, but the truck has not been wiped or inspected for a single day."
    Before the Korean armistice, during the day in the truck hideout, you could often see Yang Yonghu holding pliers and wedges, climbing over the truck attentively, checking and repairing. Sometimes, after driving for several nights in a row, his body was exhausted. During the inspection and repair, he would often doze off on the engine box, sometimes suddenly bumping into the engine, waking him up. He would immediately perk up, pick up the tools, and continue the inspection and repair. He would not go back to rest until he was satisfied.
    In November 1953, Yang Yonghu received a commendation from the political organ of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army. He himself made the greatest determination to drive the truck to 80,000 kilometers. What is 80,000 kilometers? It means that one truck has completed the mileage prescribed for two trucks, which is equivalent to saving one truck, and is also equivalent to creating 150 million yuan of wealth for the country!
    After studying the general line, Yang Yonghu became even more serious, earnest, and conscientious about his work. He said: "After studying the general line, my vision has become broader. The motherland is already carrying out socialist construction. Workers are finding tricks to create wealth for the country, and farmers are selling surplus grain to the country to support national construction. What should we, the Volunteer Army, do? In addition to being vigilant at all times on the front lines, defending national construction, we must also use practical actions to support the country, save wealth for the country, and accumulate construction funds."
    Now, Yang Yonghu's preliminary ideal has been realized. A certain unit of the Volunteer Army is preparing to request a commendation for him, but he is not at all satisfied with his achievements. He is driving this truck, moving towards the target of 90,000 and 100,000 kilometers. (Attached image)

    驾驶员杨勇虎的初步理想实现了。
    一九五四年四月二十九日，一个春雨霏霏的晚上，他驾驶的一部“嘎斯——五一型”的汽车，安全地达到了八万公里的行程，创造了朝鲜战场上三年来汽车安全行驶里程的最高纪录。
    到过朝鲜的人，都会深深体会到汽车运输对于朝鲜人民反侵略战争的重要性，正像杨勇虎自己所说的：“公路好比是血管，汽车就是流通的血液。”而杨勇虎本人正是在支援战争的运输中做了出色贡献的一个。
    一九五二年的一个夜里，杨勇虎和他的战友们在一个被敌机经常封锁的，并在铁路公路紧相毗连的兵站仓库装载炮弹，兵站的同志告诉他们：装完以后赶紧离开这里，敌机隔不上五分钟就要来的。当时，杨勇虎的车子排在最后面，等挨到杨勇虎装车的时候，恰巧一辆满载炮弹的火车停在附近。紧跟着，敌机临空了，并投下大批炸弹，当杨勇虎装完的时候，其余的汽车都已离开险境，这时，炸弹爆炸的火光把四周映的通红，他的汽车清楚地暴露在火光之下，杨勇虎的汽车处境非常危急，必须立即离开这里，否则不是敌机掉回头来会马上发现它，就是火车上已经爆炸的炮弹，会把汽车上的炮弹击中，那时不但他的汽车就要炸毁，连仓库里的数万发炮弹，也有全部毁灭的危险。兵站人员催促他赶紧掉头在附近隐蔽。因为这时隐蔽还是来得及的，但是他一想到隐蔽起来当天晚上就无法把炮弹运上前线，想到前线部队如何需要这些炮弹的支援时，他就冒着最大的危险开着满载炮弹的汽车，一股劲冲出了险境，完成了运送炮弹的任务。
    一九五三年的一月到四月，朝鲜前线的运输任务十分艰巨。杨勇虎的汽车这期间的运输特别紧张。天一擦黑，他的汽车就在公路上出现了。从兵站到阵地，杨勇虎把车子一停，便一溜风似地跑出驾驶室来，扛起装上的或是卸下的木箱，喊着：“喂！快装，争取十分钟装完！”或是：“来！一齐卸，争取天亮前多拉一趟！”这个生气勃勃，似乎永远不知道疲倦的小伙子，给兵站的装卸员和阵地上的战士带来了极大的鼓舞。一夜紧张的劳动过后仿佛他并不感到是怎样疲倦，总是那样愉快和兴奋。因为他每完成一次运输任务，就仿佛看见战士们用他运去的弹药打击敌人，就仿佛听到坑道里的战士们高声读着他运去的报纸、书信，或者是吃着他运去的祖国人民支援的食品。这时，他的全部疲劳就被一种欣喜的心情代替了。有时，他背诵着苏联英雄马特洛索夫的话对自己说：“战友们的信任，祖国的信任——对于一个人，这是最大的奖励。”
    就这样，他四个月完成了六个月的运输任务，他连续得到了三次“先锋号”的红旗，并且成了一个光荣的新民主主义青年团团员了。
    在如此艰苦的紧张的运输任务中，他怎样达到八万公里的安全行车呢？这是因为他爱护自己的汽车。他说：“爱护汽车就是爱祖国，爱人民，对祖国尽职，对人民负责。”在两年零五个月中间，他的车子没有经过一次大修和中修，没有发生过一件事故。甚至连工具都没有丢失过一件，正如党支部书记李瑞泉所说的：“他爱护车子甚于爱护他自己，被子破了可以当天不补，脸脏了可以马上不洗，车子却没有一天不擦洗和不检查的。”
    朝鲜停战前，白天在汽车隐蔽部里，可以经常看见杨勇虎拿着钳子、楔子，全神贯注地爬在车上车下检查、修理。有时，一连几夜的行车，身体疲惫不堪，在检查修理中，往往在机件箱上打瞌睡，有时猛地碰在引擎上，这才醒过来，他马上又振起精神，拣起工具，继续检查修理。一直到他认为满意的时候，才回去休息。
    一九五三年十一月，杨勇虎受到志愿军某部政治机关的通报表扬，他自己下了最大的决心，争取把车子开到八万公里，八万公里是什么呢？就是一部车完成了两部汽车规定的行驶里程，等于节约一部汽车，也等于给国家创造了一亿五千万元的财富！
    在学习了总路线以后，杨勇虎对自己的工作更加严肃认真和兢兢业业了。他说：“学习了总路线后，我的眼光看的更远了，祖国已经在进行社会主义建设，工人们找窍门，给国家创造财富，农民们把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设，我们志愿军做什么呢？除了在阵地上时刻戒备，保卫祖国建设外，还要用实际行动来支援国家，给国家节约财富，积累建设资金。”
    现在，杨勇虎的初步理想实现了。志愿军某部正准备给他请功，但他丝毫也没有满足自己的成绩，他正开着这部汽车，向着九万、十万公里的指标前进。（附图片）
