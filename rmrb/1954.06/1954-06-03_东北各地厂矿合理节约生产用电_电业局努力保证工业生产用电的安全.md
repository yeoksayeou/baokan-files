Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. From January to April this year, factories and mines in Northeast China have saved more than 30 million kilowatt-hours of electricity used for production. This electricity, if used to refine electric furnace steel ingots, could refine 34,000 tons.

This year, in the process of formulating and discussing national production plans, workers in factories and mines in Northeast China have successively put forward planned targets and specific measures for conserving industrial electricity consumption. Hundreds of factories and mines in Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Jilin, and other places have continued to launch in-depth competitions for rationally conserving electricity consumption. In the competition, many factories and mines dismantled and adjusted electrical equipment, and improved production equipment and operating methods to reduce the electricity consumption quota per unit of product. In the Shenyang Smelter, the electric lead workshop adjusted the DC and AC electrical equipment, saving a large 150-horsepower motor; the electric zinc workshop also increased the current density and reduced the inter-cell voltage, and improved the operating methods. As a result, the electricity consumption quota for major products such as electrolytic copper, electrolytic lead, and electrolytic zinc in this plant in the first quarter decreased by an average of 9 percent compared to last year. Due to the promotion of advanced experience and shortened smelting time, the electricity consumption quota per unit of steelmaking in electric furnaces at the Shenyang Rubber Machinery Repair Factory and the Shenyang Machinery Factory was reduced by a quarter to a third compared to the original. The unit electricity consumption quota for raw coal produced by the Fushun Mining Bureau and electric furnace steel ingots produced by Benxi Iron and Steel Company in the first quarter of this year was also reduced by 0.7 to 7.2 percent compared to the planned targets.

Factories and mines in Northeast China began to fully implement the work of conserving industrial electricity consumption in 1952. In the second half of 1952 and throughout 1953, a total of more than 200 million kilowatt-hours of industrial electricity were saved.

(Another dispatch) Electric Power Bureaus in Northeast China have strengthened their service to users, so that the number of major accidents among electricity users in the entire region in the first four months of this year was reduced by 44 percent compared to the same period last year.

In order to ensure the safety of electricity consumption for the production of important factories and mines, twelve electric power bureaus in Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Dalian, Fushun, and Jilin sent a large number of employees to the factories and mines early this year to check the safety of electricity consumption in the spring. In addition to inspecting and testing the various electrical equipment of these factories and mines, they also inspected and supervised the implementation of various electrical regulations and systems in the factories and mines to prevent accidents related to electricity consumption. In recent months, employees of the electric power bureaus in Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Mudanjiang, and other places have helped more than 200 important factories and mines test transformer oil, relays, lightning arresters, and lightning rods on buildings. During the test, if any safety devices were found to be faulty, the users were notified to repair or replace them, so that each safety device could withstand rigorous testing. The Northeast Electric Power Administration and local electric power bureaus also regularly print and distribute various learning materials on factory and mine substation operation, maintenance, and safety regulations for the reference of electrical personnel in various factories and mines to improve their safety awareness and technical level.

In 1952, electric power bureaus in Northeast China began to reverse the past tendency of only managing safe power supply and neglecting safe electricity consumption. They successively established dedicated user supervision sections, divisions, and groups, clarified the responsibilities of supervision personnel, and promoted the specialized zone responsibility system, so that the supervision personnel of the electric power bureaus could regularly go deep into factories and mines to check the user's safe electricity consumption.

    东北各地厂矿合理节约生产用电
    电业局努力保证工业生产用电的安全
   【新华社沈阳二日电】东北各地厂矿今年一月到四月已经节约了三千多万度的生产用电。这些电力如果用来炼电炉钢锭，可炼三万四千吨。
    东北各地厂矿职工今年在制订和讨论国家生产计划中，先后提出了节约工业用电的计划指标和具体措施。沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨、吉林等地数百个厂矿的职工，并继续深入展开合理节约用电的竞赛。许多厂矿在竞赛中拆除和调整电气设备，改进生产设备和操作方法，以降低单位产品耗电定额。在沈阳冶炼厂，电铅车间调整了直流、交流电气设备，节约出一台一百五十匹马力的大电动机；电锌车间也提高电流密度和降低槽间电压，改进了操作方法。因而，这个厂第一季度电铜、电铅、电锌等主要产品的耗电定额比去年平均降低了百分之九。沈阳橡胶机械修配厂、沈阳机械厂的电炉炼钢，由于推广先进经验，缩短熔炼时间，使炼钢单位耗电定额比原来减少了四分之一到三分之一。抚顺矿务局生产的原煤、本溪钢铁公司生产的电炉钢锭，今年第一季度单位耗电定额也比计划指标降低了百分之零点七到七点二。
    东北各地厂矿在一九五二年就已开始全面展开节约工业用电的工作，一九五二年下半年和一九五三年全年共节约工业用电两亿多度。
   【又讯】东北各地电业局加强为用户服务的工作，使得今年头四个月内全区用电户的重要事故次数，比去年同期减少了百分之四十四。
    为了保证重要厂矿生产用电的安全，沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、旅大、抚顺和吉林等地十二个电业局在今年年初就派出大批职工，深入到厂矿里去检查春季安全用电。他们除检查和试验这些厂矿的各种用电设备以外，同时检查督促各厂矿贯彻各种电气规程制度，以防止用电方面事故的发生。沈阳、鞍山、旅大、牡丹江等地的电业局职工，几个月来已帮助两百多个重要厂矿试验了变压器油、继电器、避雷器和建筑物上的避雷针等。在试验中，凡发现保安装置不良，就通知用户加以修理或更换，使得每一个保安装置都能经受得住严格的考验。东北电业管理局和各地电业局还经常印发各种厂矿变电运转、检修、保安规程等方面的学习资料，供各厂矿电气人员参考，以提高他们的安全思想和技术水平。
    东北各地电业局在一九五二年开始扭转了过去只管安全供电、忽视安全用电的偏向，先后建立了用户监察科、股、组的专责机构，划清监察人员的职责范围，推行专区专责制度，使得电业局的监察人员能够经常深入厂矿检查用户安全用电的情况。
