After the Xinjiang Daily published the Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian versions of the draft constitution, and the Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the Uyghur version, the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi were overjoyed, spreading the good news to each other. Some workers and citizens also enthusiastically held seminars and discussions. Workers of all ethnic groups at the Xinjiang Local State-Owned October Automobile Repair Factory read the newspaper during their breaks. On the evening of the 17th, eight Uyghur workers gathered to discuss their thoughts. Young worker Ai Mai'er said: Since liberation, the People's Government has established factories in Xinjiang and trained a large number of ethnic minority workers. People of all ethnic groups now have the glorious right to learn technology and build the motherland. Maula Niyazi, talking about the provision in the draft constitution's general program that all ethnic groups are equal, said: The phenomena of discrimination, oppression, and disunity among ethnic groups created by the reactionaries are long gone. If it weren't for the patient help of our Han elder brothers in the factory, how could ethnic minority workers have learned the technology in just over two years? In the future, we must further strengthen ethnic unity and increase production. First-class labor model Wu Si Man Ai Yi, who came from a farmhand family, said: In the old society, what rights did we have other than working for the landlords, being beaten, and starving? After liberation, I not only participated in factory production, but also learned culture and technology, and my life is so good. I have truly gained the right to work and receive education. In the future, I will work harder to produce and protect the rights we enjoy. Young female worker Su Biya Han said: In the past, women had no right to participate in heavy industrial production. Even if they did some hard labor and did the same work as men, they could only get very little wages. After liberation, our female workers can learn and produce together with male workers, and get the same wages for the same work. Enjoying such equal rights between men and women was something I never dreamed of in the past.

More than 20 people's representatives, street chiefs, and security committee members of Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Uzbek, Tatar, and other ethnic groups in the third district of Urumqi also held a symposium. Tatar woman Wu Luma Xi used the fact that she served as a street security committee member and propagandist to illustrate that women have enjoyed equal rights between men and women since liberation. She was particularly excited about the provision in the draft constitution that "women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social and family life." Yu Su Fu A Li You Fu had many feelings after reading the draft constitution. He said: Before liberation, many seven or eight-year-old children were so poor that they had no pants to wear. In the past few years, especially during this year's Eid al-Fitr, every child was dressed up like a flower. Sha A Ti Bai Ke, a Kazakh old man who sells milk, was excited when he saw Article 3 of the general program of the draft constitution: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we elected our own people's representatives in the general election, and ethnic regional autonomy was implemented in various ethnic minority areas. We are truly equal among all ethnic groups and have become the masters of the country. (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

   乌鲁木齐各族人民畅谈对宪法草案的感想
    当新疆日报的维吾尔文、哈萨克文和蒙古文版刊登了宪法草案的三种译文，新疆人民广播电台用维吾尔语广播了宪法草案的译文以后，乌鲁木齐市的各少数民族人民欢欣鼓舞，互相传告喜讯，有些工人和市民还热情地举行座谈和讨论。新疆地方国营十月汽车修配厂的各少数民族工人，在休息时传看了报纸。十七日傍晚，有八个维吾尔族工人在一起畅谈自己的感想。青年工人艾买尔说：解放以后，人民政府在新疆建立了工厂，培养出大批少数民族工人，各族人民都已享有学习技术、建设祖国的光荣权利。毛拉尼亚孜谈到宪法草案总纲上规定的各民族一律平等时说：过去反动派制造的各民族间歧视、压迫和不团结的现象，早已一去不复返了。我们厂里的民族工人不是汉族老大哥耐心帮助，怎么能在两年多的期间就学会技术呢？今后我们要更加强民族团结，提高生产。甲等劳动模范吾斯曼艾义提出身于雇农家庭，他说：在旧社会里，我们除了给地主干活，挨打、受饿外，还有什么权利？解放后我不但参加了工厂生产，还学文化、学技术，生活又过得这样好，真正得到了劳动和受教育的权利。今后我要更努力生产，保护我们所享有的权利。青年女工苏比亚罕说：过去妇女哪有参加重工业生产的权利，就是作些苦工，和男人干同样的活，也只能得到很少的工资。解放以后我们女工能和男工一样学习，一同生产，作一样的活就能得到相同的工资，享受这样男女平等的权利是过去做梦也想不到的。
    乌鲁木齐市第三区的维吾尔、哈萨克、汉、乌兹别克、塔塔尔等民族的二十多名人民代表、街长、治安委员，也举行了座谈。塔塔尔族妇女乌鲁玛西用自己担任街治安委员、宣传员工作的事实，说明妇女在解放以后就已经享有男女平等的权利，她对宪法草案中“妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利”的规定，特别感到兴奋。玉素甫阿力由甫读了宪法草案后有许多感触。他说：解放前许多七、八岁的孩子穷苦得没有裤子穿，这几年来，特别是今年开斋节时，家家孩子打扮得像花朵一样。卖牛奶的哈萨克族老人沙阿提拜克看到宪法草案总纲第三条时，兴奋地说：在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，我们在普选中选出自己的人民代表，各少数民族地区又实行了民族区域自治，我们真正是各民族一律平等，成了国家的主人。　（新华社）（附图片）
