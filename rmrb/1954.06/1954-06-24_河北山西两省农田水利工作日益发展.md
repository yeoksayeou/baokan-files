Farmland Water Conservancy Work in Hebei and Shanxi Provinces is Developing Rapidly

In Hebei Province, according to incomplete statistics as of early June, more than 200 new canals have been opened, more than 3,500 old canals have been repaired. Together with strengthened management of old canals, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 320,000 mu. More than 3,800 brick and stone wells, 2,800 cone wells, and more than 19,000 earthen wells have been dug; more than 6,700 old wells have been repaired; and more than 38,000 waterwheels have been lent out. Together with the strengthened management of wells and waterwheels, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 190,000 mu. In addition, more than 10,000 various soil and water conservation dams have been completed, which can control a drainage area of more than 300 square kilometers. 466 water cellars and aqueducts have been completed, which can solve the drinking water problem for about 100,000 people. The acquisition of these achievements will play a great role in combating drought and sowing, preventing drought and protecting seedlings, retaining sand and storing floods, and preserving land fertility, providing a strong guarantee for increased agricultural production, especially for the increase of grain and cotton production.

Farmers in Shanxi Province are actively building flood prevention and drainage projects. These projects started before the spring plowing this year. As of the end of May, 78 of the 120 flood prevention projects have been completed. After these projects are completed, they can protect 164,000 mu of farmland, expand flood irrigation by 60,000 mu, and also protect five cities and 149 villages from flooding. With the construction of large and medium-sized flood prevention projects, mass flood prevention projects have increased. Wuxiang County alone has built 5,402 large and small flood prevention canals and dams, which can protect 42,000 mu of land. The Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaoshangou learned from the lesson of wheat being destroyed by mountain floods last year, and built 314 flood prevention canals by the end of April this year, ensuring that 878 mu of wheat would not be affected by floods. According to incomplete statistics: more than 190 large and small drainage canals and dams have been built in various places, increasing arable land by 27,298 mu, ensuring that wheat in low-lying areas is not affected by floods. While building flood prevention and drainage projects, the province has paid more attention to the construction of farmland water conservancy projects. This year, there are 300 large and medium-sized water conservancy and irrigation projects under construction directly under the guidance of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. More than 80% of the 721 large, medium and small irrigation projects built throughout the province have been completed by the end of May, increasing the irrigated area by 230,000 mu. With the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, attention has also been paid to the work of well-drilling and the use of waterwheels. By the beginning of June, 1,780 new water wells had been drilled throughout the province, increasing the irrigated area by more than 60,000 mu. At present, farmers in various parts of the province, under the call of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, are launching a year-round movement to build canals, drill wells, prevent floods and drain waterlogging, to ensure that they are free from or reduce the threat of floods and waterlogging, and strive to develop another one million mu of irrigated land throughout the province.

    河北山西两省农田水利工作日益发展
    河北省农田水利建设工作，截至六月初旬的不完全统计，已开新渠道二百多条，修旧渠三千五百多条，连同旧渠加强管理，共扩大浇地三十二万多亩。打砖石井三千八百多眼，锥井二千八百多眼，挖土井一万九千多眼，修理旧井六千七百多眼，出贷水车三万八千多辆，连同水井水车加强管理已扩大浇地十九万多亩。此外，还完成水土保持各种坝一万多座，能控制三百多平方公里的流域面积，完成水池水窖引水管四百六十六处，约可解决十来万人口的饮水困难。这些成绩的获得，对抗旱播种，防旱保苗，拦沙蓄洪，保存地力，将起很大作用，为农业增产特别是粮棉的增产提供了有力的保证。（任杰）

    山西省农民正在积极修建防洪、排水工程。这些工程在今年春耕前开始，截至五月底为止，一百二十处防洪工程已完成七十八处。这些工程修好之后，可以保护农田十六万四千亩，扩大洪水浇地六万亩，还可以保护五座城市和一百四十九个村子不受水灾。随着大中型防洪工程的修建，群众性的防洪工程已增多。武乡一个县即修成大小防洪渠坝五千四百零二条，可护地四万二千亩。窑上沟王锦云农业生产合作社接受去年山洪冲毁小麦的教训，今年四月底即修成防洪渠三百一十四条，保证了八百七十八亩小麦免受洪灾。据不完全统计：各地已修成大小排水渠坝一百九十多条，增加耕地二万七千二百九十八亩，保证了低洼地区的小麦不受洪灾。在修建防洪排水工程的同时，该省更注意了修建农田水利工程。今年在省水利局直接指导下进行修建的大中型水利灌溉工程即有三百处。全省共计修建的七百二十一处大中小型灌溉工程到五月底已完成百分之八十多，增加水地二十三万亩。随着农田水利工程的修建，还注意了打井和使用水车的工作，到六月初全省已新打水井一千七百八十眼，增加水地六万多亩。目前全省各地农民在中共山西省委号召下正在开展一个全年修渠打井防洪排涝的运动，保证免受或减少洪灾、涝灾的威胁，争取在全省再发展一百万亩水地。　（鲁生）
