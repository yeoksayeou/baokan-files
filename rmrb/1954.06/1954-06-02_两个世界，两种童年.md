    Two Worlds, Two Childhoods
    Zhu Lunzhang
    "Children are the flowers of humanity." In the real life of countries in the peace and democracy camp, this sentence has practical significance. However, in the capitalist world, this sentence is a strong satire on the lives of children, and only peace-loving and kind people are making unremitting struggles for it.
    In socialist and people's democratic countries, people have strong beliefs and brilliant ideals for the beautiful future of mankind. Therefore, they also show infinite care and love for the new generation that symbolizes the future. In these countries, children receive meticulous care from the state even before they are born. For example, in the Soviet Union, both urban and rural mothers can go to the hospital for free delivery, and the health of mothers and babies is perfectly protected, reducing the maternal mortality rate to zero and the infant mortality rate to the lowest level in the world. In Hungary, not only do mothers get paid maternity leave, but the state also gives every newborn baby a complete set of gifts such as cradles, clothes, and small beds for free. In many cities in China, the phenomenon of newborn babies dying from tetanus has almost disappeared. These countries are doing their best to protect the health of children. The Soviet Union has established dozens of research institutes and specialized agencies to study child health care, and every child grows up under the supervision and care of pediatricians. No matter where, children receive free regular health checks. In Romania, nurseries, creches, and children’s health canteens have been established throughout the country, and these organizations operate under the technical guidance of doctors. In the German Democratic Republic, there are also kindergartens specifically for correcting children's speech impediments. In these countries, children develop and grow healthily, and children with weak constitutions or illnesses receive timely care and medical treatment.
    In stark contrast, in the capitalist world, reactionary groups who have no confidence in tomorrow and believe in the absurd theories of Malthus are indifferent to the health and lives of the next generation. In these countries, as a result of the frantic arms race, people's living conditions are deteriorating and the population reproduction rate is declining. In the United States, tens of millions of children suffer from various diseases, and thirteen million children have no access to medical care at all. According to the clearly reduced figures released by the U.S. Department of Health, twelve children die every hour in the United States. In Japan, having children has become a heavy burden for the vast working people, and the birth rate has fallen to the lowest level in the past fifty years. In 1951, the shocking figure of more than 638,000 so-called legal abortions occurred. In France, many mothers commit suicide because they cannot afford to raise their children. Due to hunger and disease, the health of children is deteriorating, and their lives are seriously threatened. In West Germany, nearly a quarter of young children suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, and more than half of the children in the Netherlands suffer from anemia. The infant mortality rate in Italy is as high as 74%; nearly 200,000 children die in Spain every year. The health conditions of children in colonies and dependent countries are even worse. In Malaya, more than 1,000 babies die every month; in Sudan, 75% of children suffer from malaria, lung diseases, and other diseases, with a mortality rate of more than 50%.
    The countries of the peace and democracy camp have created all possible conditions to cultivate and educate the growing generation, so that their bodies and minds can develop normally. Children's education has become an important task of the state. In the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries, the phenomenon of children dropping out of school has been eliminated, and the laws on universal compulsory education are strictly enforced, ensuring that "no child is left out of school." In the Soviet Union, the best architects and hygienists are designing new school buildings for children, and they are studying and experimenting with special ultraviolet lights in classrooms to compensate for the lack of sunlight in winter. Bulgaria's national education expenditure in 1953 increased fourteen times compared to 1939. The number of primary school students in our country last year has more than doubled compared to the highest year before the war. In order to cultivate children's good qualities of loving the motherland, labor, and peace, and to provide them with opportunities for full development of their talents, socialist and people's democratic countries attach great importance to the cultural welfare of children. Each country has established many children's palaces, children's homes, children's theaters, scientific work stations, dance halls, and other extracurricular activity venues, so that children can enjoy a rich cultural life. Take the Soviet Union's "Artek" Young Pioneer Palace as an example, it has its own orchards, vineyards, livestock farms, bakeries, and other various workshops, and the state allocates a large amount of funds every year to maintain these undertakings. In the Soviet Union, many cities have established railways specially designed for children and managed by children themselves to develop children's labor skills. Cultural publishing institutions in various countries publish a large number of books and produce beautiful toys for children every year. In the Soviet Union, one out of every nine books printed is printed for children. The number of children's books published in Poland in the first half of last year was several times more than all the literary books published in the twenty years before the war. Children in Czechoslovakia have their own national publishing house, and writers often discuss their works with young readers and listen to their opinions and hopes. In order to make new toys for children, the Hungarian government held a toy design competition to solicit designs. All this is for one purpose: to make the new generation live happily and grow up healthily.
    All of this that children enjoy in socialist and people's democratic countries can only be a dream for children in the capitalist world. In that world, children have become victims of the war preparation policy. The reactionary group deprives millions of children of bread and the right to knowledge, leaving them to live in hunger and ignorance. In the United States, which boasts of "civilization," only a quarter of children have the opportunity to be educated. U.S. officials also admit that 33 percent of existing schools are unsafe and unsanitary. Two-thirds of school-age children in Brazil cannot attend school. Ninety percent of school-age children in Iran are out of school. The U.S. ruling group is carrying out barbaric and reactionary education on children, poisoning their minds with ideas of war terror, racial discrimination, and militarism, in an attempt to cultivate them into ignorant tools to be enslaved and driven by them. In elementary schools in the United States, atomic bomb avoidance drills have become a daily routine for children. Teachers who have a little conscience and are unwilling to instill war ideas into students are subject to dismissal or more serious persecution. Insane reactionary groups also use various books, newspapers, movies, and radio programs to poison children's minds. According to a U.S. survey, two-thirds of the 300 "funny story comics" sold on the streets of the United States every month are engaged in bestial, concentrated, and repeated descriptions of death and destruction, and they teach children various methods of robbery and murder; most American movies are also full of pornographic and criminal toxins. At the same time, this "American culture" has spread to all corners of the capitalist world.
    Due to the propaganda and education that teaches obscenity and theft, the number of children committing crimes in capitalist countries has increased dramatically. In the United States, 250,000 to 400,000 children are imprisoned for crimes every year, and 1,500 school children in New York alone are addicted to drugs. In West Germany, juvenile delinquency cases have increased by 60% in the past four years. In Japan, the number of children committing crimes in some places even exceeds the number of adults committing crimes.
    The tragic fate of children in the capitalist world does not stop there. Tens of thousands of boys and girls have even lost their personal freedom and are sold like slaves. There are organizations that buy and sell babies everywhere in the United States. The Philippines has so-called "employment agencies" that specialize in selling rural girls as prostitutes. The number of child trafficking incidents in Japan has doubled every year in recent years, and the value of a child has dropped to less than that of a dog or cat. A larger number of children are forced to engage in various heavy labor for the sake of livelihood and are subjected to cruel exploitation. According to official U.S. materials, in addition to the 500,000 child laborers employed in agriculture, there are at least 3 million child laborers engaged in various other labors in the United States, and another 1 million join the workforce during the summer vacation. In the Italian oil industry, nearly one-third of the workers are children under the age of fourteen. In Thailand, children aged seven or eight work 12 to 14 hours a day like adults, but the wages they receive are only one-tenth of that of adults.
    In the capitalist world, millions of children—humanity’s most valuable asset—are living a very miserable life under the threat of hunger, ignorance, terror, and death.
    All honest people, all kind parents who love their children, and all people who care about the fate of children in various capitalist countries are infinitely yearning for the happy lives of children in the socialist camp, and they are paving the way for the cause of the new generation all over the world in the struggle against the conspiracies of new war provocateurs and defending world peace.

    两个世界，两种童年
    朱伦璋
    “儿童是人类的花朵。”这句话，在和平民主阵营各国的现实生活中，富有实际的意义。但是在资本主义世界里，这句话却是对儿童生活的强烈的讽刺，只有爱好和平的善良的人民为此而作着不懈的斗争。
    在社会主义和人民民主国家里，人们对于人类美好的未来有着坚强的信念和灿烂的理想，因此，对于象征着未来的新生的一代也表现了无限的关怀和爱护。在这些国家中，儿童还未出生以前就受到了国家无微不至的照顾。例如在苏联，不论城市乡村产妇都能免费进医院生产，妇婴的健康得到最完善的保护，使产妇的死亡率降低到等于零，婴儿死亡率降低到世界上最低的水平。在匈牙利，不仅产妇可以得到工资照付的产假，而且国家免费送给每一个新生婴儿一整套摇篮、衣服及小床等礼物。在中国的许多城市里，新生婴儿死于破伤风的现象几乎已经绝迹。这些国家都以最大的力量来保护儿童的健康。苏联建立了几十个研究所和专门机构从事研究儿童保健工作，每一个儿童都是在儿科医生的监督和照顾下生长的。不管在什么地方，儿童都得到免费的定期的健康检查。在罗马尼亚，托儿所、托儿站、儿童卫生食堂的设立，已遍及全国，这些组织都是在医师的技术指导下进行工作。在民主德国，还成立了专门矫正儿童口齿不清的幼儿园。在这些国家中，儿童们健康地发育成长，体质羸弱或有病的儿童也得到及时的护理和医疗。
    与此完全相反，在资本主义世界里，对明天没有信心、信奉着马尔萨斯的荒谬学说的反动集团，对于下一代的健康和生命是漠不关心的。在这些国家中，由于疯狂地扩军备战的结果，人民生活条件日益恶化，人口繁殖率不断下降。美国有数以千万计的儿童害着各种各样的疾病，一千三百万儿童根本得不到医药上的照顾。根据美国卫生部公布的显然缩小了的数字，美国每小时就有十二个儿童死亡。在日本，生儿育女成了广大劳动人民沉重的负担，婴儿的出生率已降到五十年来最低的水平。在一九五一年中，所谓合法堕胎竟达六十三万八千多起的惊人数字。在法国，许多母亲因为养不活自己的孩子而自杀。由于饥饿和疾病，儿童的健康情况每况愈下，生命受到严重的威胁。在西德，差不多四分之一的幼儿染有肺结核病，荷兰有一半以上的儿童患着贫血症。意大利婴孩死亡率高达百分之七十四；西班牙每年差不多要死去二十万儿童。殖民地和附属国的儿童的健康情况则更为恶劣。在马来亚，每月夭折的婴孩在一千名以上；在苏丹，百分之七十五的儿童患有疟疾、肺病和其他病症，死亡率在百分之五十以上。
    和平民主阵营各国创造了一切可能的条件来培养和教育正在成长的一代，使他们的身心能够得到正常的发展。儿童教育成为国家的一项重要的工作。在苏联和东欧人民民主国家里，儿童失学的现象已经消灭，普及义务教育的法律被严格地执行，做到了“不使一个儿童留在学校之外”。在苏联，最优秀的建筑学家和卫生学家为孩子们设计新的校舍，他们正在研究和试验在教室中用特别的紫外线灯光来弥补冬天阳光的不足。保加利亚一九五三年国民教育的经费比一九三九年增加了十四倍。我国去年小学生的数目已比战前最高的年份增加了一倍多。为了培养儿童热爱祖国、劳动与和平的良好品质，使他们的才智获得充分发展的机会，社会主义和人民民主国家极端重视对于儿童的文化福利工作。每个国家都建立了许许多多的少年宫、儿童之家、儿童剧院、科学工作站、跳舞厅等等课外活动场所，使儿童获得丰富的文化生活。就以苏联的一个“阿泰克”少年先锋宫来说，它有着自己的果树园、葡萄园、牲畜农场、面包场和其他各种工场，由国家每年拨出大量的经费来维持这些事业。在苏联，许多城市中都建立了专为儿童而设的、由儿童自己管理的铁路，以锻炼儿童的劳动技能。各国的文化出版机关每年为儿童出版大量的读物和制造优美的玩具。在苏联每印行九册书籍中就有一册是为儿童而印的。波兰去年半年之中出版的儿童读物的数目，就比战前二十年中出版的全部文学书籍还要多好几倍。捷克斯洛伐克的儿童有自己的国家出版社，作家们经常和小读者们一块讨论自己的著作，听取他们的意见和希望。匈牙利政府为了给儿童制造新的玩具，特举办了玩具设计比赛来征求图样。这一切都是为了一个目的：使新的一代愉快地生活和健全地成长起来。
    社会主义和人民民主国家的儿童所享受的这一切，对于资本主义世界的儿童只能是一种梦想。在那个世界中，儿童成了备战政策的牺牲品。反动集团剥夺了千百万儿童的面包和求知的权利，使他们饥饿和无知地活着。夸耀“文明”的美国，只有四分之一的儿童有受到教育的机会。美国官方也承认现有的学校中，有百分之三十三是不安全和不卫生的。巴西有三分之二的学龄儿童不能念书。伊朗的失学儿童占到儿童总数的百分之九十。美国统治集团对儿童进行着野蛮、反动的教育，用战争恐怖、种族歧视、军国主义等思想毒害儿童的心灵，企图把他们培养成为任由他们奴役和驱使的愚昧的工具。在美国的小学校中，躲避原子弹的演习已成为儿童们的日常功课。稍有良心而不愿向学生灌输战争思想的教师都要遭到解雇或更严重的迫害。丧心病狂的反动集团并利用各种书报、电影、广播节目来毒害儿童的心理。据美国的一项调查说，每月在美国街头销售的三百种“滑稽故事连环画”中，就有三分之二是从事于兽性地、集中地和一再地讲述死亡和破坏的，它们教给儿童各种盗劫、杀人的方法；大部分美国的电影也是充满了色情和犯罪的毒素。同时，这种“美国文化”已经传布到资本主义世界的各个角落了。
    由于受着诲淫诲盗的宣传教育，资本主义各国儿童犯罪的数目惊人地增加。在美国，每年有二十五万到四十万儿童犯罪入狱，仅纽约一地就有一千五百个在学儿童吸毒。西德最近四年来少年儿童犯罪案增加了百分之六十。在日本，有些地方儿童犯罪的数目甚至超过了成人犯罪的数目。
    资本主义世界中儿童的悲惨命运还不止此。成千成万的男女儿童甚至丧失了人身的自由，和奴隶一样地被贩卖。美国到处都有买卖婴儿的组织。菲律宾有专门贩卖农村女孩子作娼妓的所谓“职业介绍所”。日本贩卖儿童的事件近几年来每年增加一倍，一个儿童的身价降低到还不及一只狗和猫。更大数量的儿童则为了生活被迫从事着各种沉重的劳动，受着残酷的剥削。根据美国官方材料，美国除了农业中雇用五十万童工外，至少还有三百万童工从事其他各种劳动，在暑假期间参加工作的还要增加一百万。在意大利的石油工业中，几乎有三分之一的工人是十四岁以下的儿童。在泰国，七八岁的儿童与成人一样每天工作十二至十四小时，而所得到的工资只有成人的十分之一。
    在资本主义世界中，千百万儿童——人类最宝贵的财产——就是这样处在饥饿、愚昧、恐怖和死亡的威胁下过着极悲惨的生活。
    资本主义世界各国一切正直的人们、一切热爱自己的孩子的善良的父母亲们、一切关心儿童命运的人们，对社会主义阵营各国儿童的幸福生活无限向往，他们在反对新战争挑拨者的阴谋、保卫世界和平的斗争中为全世界新生的一代的事业开辟着道路。
