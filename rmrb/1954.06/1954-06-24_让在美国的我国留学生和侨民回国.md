    Let Our Students and Overseas Chinese in the United States Return Home
    By Our Correspondent Dù Bō
    A few days ago, the Delegation of the People's Republic of China in Geneva received a letter. It was sent from Nanjing, China, dated June 1st. The letter read as follows:
    "Today is International Children's Day. Millions of children in the motherland are endlessly happy and have boundless futures under the great care and perfect education of the motherland. Our children are no exception. They are also growing up strong under the loving and warm sunshine of the motherland, but they have a family defect that others do not—their father has not returned.
      "Especially on a festival like today, they look up and ask, 'Mom, why hasn't Dad come back to celebrate the holiday with us?' They say, 'How wonderful it would be if Dad could see me join the Young Pioneers today,' 'It would be even more fun if Dad could see our performance in person.'
      "These innocent words evoke the anxieties buried deep in the hearts of mothers. We don't want to, but cannot help but let this anxiety infect the young minds of our children. We implore our delegation with extreme sincerity to convey the cries of 'I want my dad' from our children to all people with a sense of justice."
    At the end of this letter are the signatures of a mother of three children, four mothers of two children, and one mother of one child. For the safety of the children's fathers, their names cannot be published here.
    Where have the children’s fathers gone?
    They went to the United States to study five, six, seven, or even eight years ago. They finished their studies long ago. They hoped to return to China to reunite with their families and serve their motherland. However, the U.S. government refused to give them exit visas. They cannot return or even leave the United States. They have been waiting helplessly for one year, two years, almost three years.
    As stated in their letter, the statement made by Huang Hua, spokesperson of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China attending the Geneva Conference, on May 26th, denouncing the United States for detaining Chinese overseas and students, "ignited a new flame of hope" in them. They expressed their gratitude to the representatives of the motherland, and they requested the representatives of the motherland to negotiate with the United States to retrieve their loved ones.
    This letter is just one of many similar letters that the Chinese delegation receives every day. There are more than 5,000 Chinese students in the United States, most of whom have completed their studies. Along with many other Chinese overseas, they yearn to return home day and night. However, the U.S. government does not grant them this right.
    The People's Government will, of course, make every effort to rescue the Chinese students and overseas Chinese who are being forcibly detained in the United States. The four contacts between the personnel of the Chinese delegation in Geneva and the personnel of the U.S. delegation on June 4th, June 10th, June 15th, and June 21st were efforts made for this purpose.
    As a result of the contact, the U.S. representatives groundlessly rejected the various reasonable suggestions made by the Chinese representatives. The kind people of the world have once again seen the true value of the humanity, justice, and freedom that American diplomats speak of.
    On what grounds does the U.S. government forcibly detain Chinese students and overseas Chinese?
    U.S. representatives cannot but admit that the detained Chinese students and overseas Chinese have not violated any U.S. laws. The only explanation they can give is that, according to U.S. law, the U.S. president has the right to prohibit foreign nationals from entering or leaving the country during wartime, a national emergency, or when any two countries in the world are at war. Why does the U.S. specifically prohibit Chinese overseas from leaving the country? The U.S. government shamelessly and openly declares that allowing capable Chinese students and overseas Chinese to return to China violates the interests of the United States.
    For example, in September 1951, a group of Chinese students sailed from San Francisco to return to China. On September 25th, the ship passed through Honolulu, and the students were detained by the U.S. Immigration Bureau and immediately escorted back to the United States. One of them was Dr. of Medicine Wang Liangneng. On October 1st of the same year, the U.S. Department of Justice Immigration Bureau wrote to Congressman Bain, explaining the incident, stating that "Dr. Wang has recently been trying to return to China to reunite with his family. The bureau's Honolulu office temporarily prevented him from leaving because it believes that his expertise may be of considerable value to a powerful enemy of the United States, and therefore believes that this would endanger the interests of our country."
    Two years and nine months have passed, and Wang Liangneng has not yet returned to China.
    In the eyes of the U.S. government, China having one more doctor, and that doctor curing a few more Chinese patients, harms the interests of the United States; while if a few more patients die in China, it is in the interests of the United States. That is the truth of the matter.
    Even U.S. representatives dare not fully expose this unspeakable "reason" in front of Chinese representatives. They fabricated another "reason," saying that Chinese overseas do not want to return to China. They cited figures saying that among the more than 5,000 students, only 120 have applied to return to China and been rejected in recent years.
    Regarding this, one only needs to look at the letters sent by Chinese students in the United States to the Chinese delegation to understand. After Chinese students graduate from American schools, as long as they go to the Immigration Bureau to apply for return to China, they will not only be rejected, but also be told that they are not allowed to leave the country by order of the U.S. government. If they violate this order, they will be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for up to five years, or both.
    It is virtually impossible for Chinese students to violate this order, but they are not safe even if they are forced to stay in the United States, because anyone who has expressed a desire to return to China will be regarded as a "pro-communist," and in McCarthyist America, everyone knows the fate of "pro-communists." Those who want to return to China become the target of the FBI, their actions are monitored, their jobs are not guaranteed, and they live in terror all day long.
    For example, there is Huang Baotong, a Chinese student studying chemical engineering at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in New York. Because he yearned for his motherland, he was summoned to Ellis Island by the U.S. Immigration Bureau in 1952 for interrogation. He was detained there until January 1953. After being released on bail, he now has to report to the Immigration Bureau every Monday. A Chinese overseas, even though he yearns to return to his motherland day and night, if he knows that the result of his application is not to be fulfilled, but rather to suffer, why should he throw himself into the net? But persecution cannot stifle the Chinese overseas and students residing in the United States from longing for their motherland. The Chinese delegation in Geneva received many letters from the United States, many of which mentioned the ambition and ideal of contributing what they have learned to the motherland, and the depression that this ambition and ideal cannot be realized. Among the more than 5,000 Chinese students, many PhDs in engineering are working as draftsmen, PhDs in science are washing dishes in restaurants, and PhDs in liberal arts are babysitting.
    They are doing such work simply to make a living, and the wages they receive are much lower than those of Americans doing the same work, and they are constantly threatened with unemployment.
    Many letters mentioned the longing for relatives, mentioning the pain of separation. If the contents of these letters cannot be quoted, at least a letter from a reader published in the American "Christian Science Monitor" not long ago can be quoted. The author of this letter is a Chinese student named Liang. He exposed a series of actions by the U.S. government to prevent him from returning to China. He has been separated from his wife in the motherland for six years. He is not allowed to return home to reunite with her, nor is he allowed to go to England to meet his wife. He wrote at the end of the letter, "This policy unnecessarily creates human suffering... The free choice to pursue happiness is an inalienable sacred right of every individual."
    A Chinese student in the United States who recently escaped from danger and arrived in Geneva after many difficulties, complained about the painful life of Chinese overseas in the United States who have lost their freedom. Everyone hides in their hearts the desire to return to their motherland, but they dare not reveal it to anyone else. Chinese people's letters are intercepted and houses are searched. Not long ago, a group of Chinese students in New York were talking about returning to China while eating in a restaurant. Their voices were a little louder, and immediately someone ran over and warned them, "Don't talk nonsense, be careful." A few minutes later, a group of FBI agents arrived and took them away for questioning.
    Chinese people are often interrogated by the FBI, the Immigration Bureau, and the State Department. Sometimes before the interrogation, you are required to swear—raise your hand and listen to U.S. officials read a long oath that you don't know what it is, and then ask you "Do you want to return to China?" If you answer "Yes," then from now on you will become the target of special agents' terror; if you say "No," then if you want to apply to return to China in the future, you will be committing a crime, because according to U.S. law, it is a crime to be unfaithful to your oath, and your words have been recorded during the interrogation.
    Chinese people in the United States live under such extremely cruel mental torture. This is why many letters received by the Chinese government from overseas Chinese have no address or even no signature.
    Only after leaving the United States and seeing the representatives of the motherland do they feel that they have regained human dignity and human rights.
    All kinds of persecution can only deepen the love of Chinese overseas for their motherland. A Chinese student who studied at the University of Iowa wrote "Love Me Hua" every time he mentioned Iowa when recounting his history. They place their hope of saving themselves from suffering on the increasingly prosperous motherland.
    In view of this situation, the Chinese representative put forward a proposal on June 21, to issue a joint communiqué: "The Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Delegation of the United States of America attending the Geneva Conference held contacts in Geneva on the issue of overseas Chinese and students, and both sides will respect the right of law-abiding overseas Chinese and students of the other party residing in their respective countries to leave the country and return to their home country. These overseas Chinese and students should have the freedom to return to their motherland at any time."
    If it were not harboring ulterior motives to detain the other party's overseas Chinese, this joint communiqué could not be rejected, but the U.S. representative rejected it.
    The Chinese representative then suggested that the interests of overseas Chinese and students of the two countries be managed by the envoys of a third country designated by both parties stationed in China and the United States. The fairness and rationality of this suggestion is beyond doubt. If the United States did not intend to persecute Chinese overseas and students in the United States, and if the United States truly cared about American overseas in China, then it would have no reason to reject this suggestion.
    But this suggestion was also rejected for discussion by the U.S. representative.
    The only answer to this continuous refusal attitude is: the United States is afraid that the result of doing so will cause a large number of Chinese overseas and students to apply to return to China, and it will not be able to continue to detain them. It is afraid that the truth will be exposed and the conspiracy will be seen through, so it has to refuse.
    The U.S. government is detaining a large number of innocent Chinese students and overseas Chinese, but it hopes that the Chinese government will release the few Americans who have violated Chinese law and been detained and return them to the United States. The U.S. representative agreed to contact the Chinese representative in Geneva for this purpose.
    Chinese representative Wang Bingnan told U.S. representative Johnson: The Chinese government has always protected American overseas, as long as they abide by Chinese law. As long as they have no outstanding civil or criminal cases, they can leave China and return to their country at any time if they wish. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, 1,485 American overseas have left China. The Chinese government has never made things difficult for them because they were American citizens. As for the detained Americans listed on the list submitted by the U.S., some of them were engaged in espionage activities hostile to the Chinese people within China; some of them were American military personnel and intelligence personnel who intruded into Chinese airspace and territorial waters without reason; some of them had outstanding civil cases (such as unpaid debts) and were not allowed to leave the country until the case was closed. Their sentencing and detention are deserved, but after sentencing, if these prisoners behave well, the Chinese government may also consider commutation or early release. The Chinese government has done this in the past and will do so in the future.
    The situations of the overseas Chinese of the two countries are completely different, and the attitudes of the governments of the two countries towards overseas Chinese are also completely different.
    Even so, the Chinese side's suggestions took into account both sides on a fair and reasonable basis: to declare to the overseas Chinese of both sides that as long as they have not been convicted of violating the law, they have the freedom to return to their country; to entrust the envoys of third countries stationed in the two countries to manage the interests of overseas Chinese and students. Now that the United States has rejected China's suggestions, it can only make people suspect that it does not really want to solve the problem of overseas Chinese and students of the two countries, but only wants to unilaterally demand that China release those illegal Americans in China, and at the same time wants to continue to forcibly detain innocent Chinese overseas and students.

    让在美国的我国留学生和侨民回国
    本报记者　杜波
    几天以前，在日内瓦的中华人民共和国代表团收到了一封信，发信的地点是中国南京，时间是六月一日，信里写着下面的话：
    “今天是国际儿童节，千千万万的儿童们在祖国高度的爱护和完善的教养下，幸福无边，前途无量。我们的孩子当然也不例外。他们一样在祖国慈爱温暖的阳光普照下成长壮大，但是他们却有着别人所没有的家庭的缺陷——爸爸没有回来。
      “尤其是像今天这样的节日，他们仰着头问：‘妈妈，爸爸怎么还不回来和我们一起过节呀’。他们说：‘要是爸爸今天能见到我加入少年先锋队该多好哇’，‘爸爸亲眼看到我们的表演就更有趣啦’。
      “这些天真的话句勾起了做母亲的埋在心底的焦愁，我们不愿但是却无法不让这种焦愁不感染到孩子幼小的心灵。我们怀着极端恳切的心情向我们的代表团请求，请求把孩子们‘我要爸爸’的呼声传达给一切有正义感的人士。”
    在这封信的末尾署名的有一位三个孩子的母亲，四位两个孩子的母亲，一位一个孩子的母亲。为了孩子们父亲的安全，她们的名字不能在这里发表。
    孩子们的父亲到哪里去了呢？
    他们在五年、六年、七年甚至八年以前到美国读书去了，很久以前他们就读完了自己的学程，他们满怀希望地想回到中国来与自己的亲人团聚，为自己的祖国服务。但是，美国政府拒绝给他们出境签证，他们无法回来甚至无法离开美国，他们无可奈何地等待着一年、两年快三年了。
    像她们信里所说的那样，出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团发言人黄华五月二十六日斥责美国扣留中国侨民和留学生的谈话，在她们“眼前燃起了一股新的希望之火”。她们对于祖国的代表表示感激，她们要求祖国的代表向美国交涉索回自己的亲人。
    这封信只是中国代表团每天要收到的许多同类的信中间的一封。在美国的中国留学生有五千多人，他们中的绝大部分已完成了学业，与其他许多中国侨民在一起，日夜渴望归国，然而美国政府却不给他们这样的权利。
    人民的政府当然要尽一切努力来解救被强迫扣留的留美中国学生和中国侨民。六月四日、六月十日、六月十五日和六月二十一日，在日内瓦的中国代表团人员与美国代表团人员进行了四次接触，就是为此而作的努力。
    接触的结果，美国代表毫无理由地拒绝了中国代表所提出的各项合理建议。全世界善良的人们又一次看到了美国外交家嘴里所说的人道、正义、自由的真正价值是什么。
    美国政府凭什么理由强迫扣留中国的学生和侨民呢？
    美国的代表也不能不承认被扣留的中国的学生和侨民并没有触犯美国的任何一条法律，他们所唯一能给予的解释是根据美国法律，美国总统有权在战时或处于全国紧急状态时或者世界上有任何两国交战时禁止外国侨民进出。为什么美国偏偏要禁止中国侨民出境呢？美国政府不识羞耻地公开宣扬让有能力的中国学生和侨民回国就违反了美国的利益。
    可以举一个例子：一九五一年九月，有一群中国学生从旧金山乘船回国，九月二十五日船经檀香山，这批学生被美国移民局扣了下来，随即押解回美国，其中有一个医学博士汪良能。同年十月一日，美国司法部移民局致函众议员贝恩，说明这一事件时说“查汪博士最近竭力设法要回到中国去和他的家人团聚，本局驻檀香山办事处暂时阻止他离境，原因是鉴于他之所学可能会对于美国的一个强大敌人有相当大的价值，因而相信这会危害我国的利益”。
    两年九个月过去了，汪良能还没有回国。
    在美国政府看来，中国多了一位医生，多医活几个中国病人，就危害了美国的利益；而如果中国多死了几个病人，就符合美国的利益。事情的真相就是如此。
    甚至美国代表也不敢把这种不可告人的“理由”赤裸裸地当着中国代表的面全部端出来，他们捏造了另一个“理由”，说中国侨民并不想回国，他们举出数字说在五千多名留学生中，近年来要申请回国而被拒绝的只有一百二十人。
    关于这个，只要看一看中国留美学生给中国代表团寄来的信就明白了。中国学生在美国学校毕业之后，只要到移民局去办理回国手续，他所受到的不仅是拒绝，而且还被告知，不准他们离境乃是美国政府的命令，如果违反这一命令就将被判处五千美元以下的罚金或五年以下的徒刑，或同时予以两种处分。
    中国的留学生要违反这个命令，事实上是不可能的，但他们被迫居留在美国又得不到太平，因为任何表示过想回中国的，从此就将被视为“亲共分子”，而在麦卡锡主义下的美国，“亲共分子”的命运是谁都知道的。那些想要回国的人就成为美国联邦调查局的对象，行动受监视，职业无保障，整天生活在恐怖中。
    如果要例子，可以举出在纽约布鲁克林工学院读化工的中国学生黄葆同。他因为向往祖国，在一九五二年被美国移民局传到爱理斯岛审问，在那里被拘禁到一九五三年一月，在被保释以后，现在每星期一都要到移民局去报到。一个中国侨民虽然他日夜渴望返回祖国，但是如果他知道他申请的结果是不能如愿，反要遭殃，他为什么要自投罗网呢？但是迫害并不能扼杀留居美国的中国侨民和留学生对祖国的向往，在日内瓦的中国代表团收到了许多从美国寄来的信，许多信都提到想以所学贡献给祖国的抱负与理想，以及这种抱负与理想无法施展的苦闷。五千多名中国留学生中，有许多工科博士在做绘图员、理科博士在给餐馆洗碟子、文科博士在给人家看孩子。
    做的是这样的工作，仅仅是为了糊口活命，拿的工资还要比做同样工作的美国人少得多，而且随时随地都有失业的威胁。
    许多信都提到对于亲人的怀念，提到骨肉分离的痛苦，如果这些信的内容不能引用，至少不久以前发表在美国“基督教科学箴言报”上的一封读者来信是可以引用的。这封信的作者是一个姓梁的中国学生，他揭发了美国政府阻止他回国的一连串行动，他与留在祖国的妻子分别已经六年，他要求回国团圆不许，要求到英国去会见自己的妻子也不许，他在信的最后写道“这种政策不必要地造成了人生的痛苦……为追求幸福而作的自由选择是每一个人不可剥夺的神圣权利”。
    一个最近经过不少艰难脱离虎口逃到了日内瓦的中国留美学生，申诉了中国侨民在美国失掉了自由的痛苦生活，每一个人在心底藏着返回祖国的愿望，却不敢向任何别的人透露。中国人的信件被截扣，住房被搜查。不久以前，纽约有一群中国学生在餐馆吃饭的时候，大家谈到回国的心思，声音略略大了一些，马上旁边跑过来一个人，警告他们 “不要胡说八道，当心看颜色”，几分钟以后就到了一批联邦调查局的特务，把他们押去问话。
    中国人经常要受到联邦调查局、移民局、国务院的审问，有时候审问前先要你宣誓——举起手来听美国官员念完一大段根本不知是什么的誓辞，然后问你“想不想回中国”，如果回答说“想”，那末从今以后你就成了特务恐怖的对象；如果说“不想”，那么你以后再要申请回国就是犯了法，因为按照美国的法律，不忠于自己的誓言是有罪的，而且你的话在审问时已经录了音。
    在美国的中国人，生活在这样极其残酷的精神折磨下，这就是为什么中国政府收到的许多侨民来信上面没有地址甚至没有署名的原因。
    只有离开了美国，见到了祖国的代表才感到恢复了人的尊严和人的权利。
    种种的迫害只能加深中国侨民对自己祖国的热爱。有一个在伊阿华大学读过书的中国学生在叙述自己的历史时，每一次提到伊阿华时都写成“爱我华”。他们把拯救自己出于苦难的希望寄托在日益昌盛的祖国的身上。
    鉴于这种情况，中国代表在六月二十一日提出了一个建议，由双方发表一个联合公报：“出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团和美利坚合众国代表团在日内瓦举行关于侨民和留学生问题的接触，双方都对于住在各该国内的对方的守法侨民和留学生的离境回国的权利将予尊重。这些侨民和留学生应有随时返回祖国的自由”。
    如果不是怀着阴谋扣留对方侨民的鬼胎，这个联合公报是不能被拒绝的，然而美国代表拒绝了它。
    中国代表接着又建议由双方各自指定的第三国驻中美两国使节代管两国侨民和留学生的利益，这一建议的公平合理是无可怀疑的，如果美国不是有意迫害在美国的中国的侨民和留学生，同时如果美国真正关心在中国的美国侨民，那么它就没有任何理由拒绝这个建议。
    但是这个建议同样被美国代表拒绝讨论。
    对于这种连续拒绝的态度，唯一的答案是：美国害怕这样做的结果，将引起大量中国侨民与留学生的申请返国，也将无法继续扣留他们。它害怕真相暴露，阴谋拆穿，因此只好拒绝。
    美国政府扣留着大批的无辜的中国学生与侨民，然而它却希望中国政府把少数违反中国法律而被拘禁的美国人释放回国，美国代表所以同意与中国代表在日内瓦进行接触，其目的即在于此。
    中国代表王炳南告诉美国代表约翰逊：中国政府对于美国侨民，只要他们遵守中国法律，是一贯给予保护的，只要他们没有未了的民刑案件，在他们愿意时，随时可以离华返国。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，已经有一千四百八十五名美国侨民离开了中国，中国政府从来没有过因为他们是美国公民而加以留难。至于美方交来的名单上所列出的被拘禁的美国人，其中有的是在中国境内进行敌视中国人民的间谍活动的分子；有的是无端侵入中国领空领海的美国军事人员与谍报人员；有的是有民事案件未了（如债务未清）而在该案了结以前不准离境的。他们之被判刑与被拘禁是罪有应得，但是在判刑之后，如果这些犯人的行为表现良好，中国政府也还可以考虑减刑或提前释放，中国政府过去曾这样做过，今后也会这样做。
    两国侨民的情况完全不同，两国政府对待侨民的态度也完全不同。
    虽然如此，中国方面的建议还是在公平合理的基础上照顾到了双方：向双方的侨民声明，只要他们并未违法判刑，即有回国的自由；委托第三国驻两国使节来代管两国侨民和留学生的利益。现在美国既然拒绝了中国的建议，它就只能使人怀疑它并不是真正想解决两国侨民和留学生的问题，而只是想片面地要求中国方面释放那些违法的在华美国人，同时要继续强迫扣留无辜的中国侨民和留学生。
