    Several Issues to Note When Establishing a Comrades' Court in Production Enterprises
    Si Xuan

    The Comrades' Court of Production Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as the Comrades' Court) is a mass organization for self-education of workers. Since the establishment of the first Comrades' Court in Anshan Iron and Steel Company in March last year, many provincial and municipal people's courts have also sent working groups to key state-owned factories and mines with strong leadership to pilot the establishment of Comrades' Courts. As of the end of May this year, a total of seventy Comrades' Courts have been established in factories and mines in Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Shenyang, and Dalian in the Northeast; Tangshan and Tianjin in North China; Xi'an, Xianyang, and Lanzhou in the Northwest; Wuhan and Pingxiang in Central and Southern China; and Hangzhou in East China. The experience of more than a year of piloting has proved that the Comrades' Courts have played a significant role in raising workers' awareness, consolidating labor discipline, promoting production, complying with technical operations and safety regulations, and preventing accidents due to negligence. In the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Transportation Department, the attendance rate of the third and fifth loading and unloading teams was often only 80% per month. Through the publicity and education of the Comrades' Court, coupled with the influence of other publicity and organizational work, the attendance rate of the third team increased to over 98%, and the fifth team increased to over 99%, reversing the past phenomenon of not being able to complete loading and unloading tasks. After the Dalian Measuring Instrument Factory dealt with the case of worker Jia Shanbao privately misappropriating workers' savings and other violations of labor discipline through the Comrades' Court, it helped the factory rectify labor discipline and consistently overfulfilled its tasks. Jia Shanbao himself also corrected his mistakes, and his production performance broke the factory's record. In addition, in many factories and mines, due to the education of the Comrades' Courts, the phenomenon of disunity among employees has decreased, and enthusiasm for production has been further enhanced. These examples vividly illustrate the role and significance of the Comrades' Court.

    However, because the establishment of the Comrades' Court is a new task, some factory and mine leaders and workers do not fully understand its nature and role. Some factory and mine leaders believe that piloting the Comrades' Court is merely a "pilot project by the court" and "has little to do with them." Some even believe that running the Comrades' Court "will delay production." When a factory was piloting the Comrades' Court, the leadership initially thought that they were only "helping," some cadres suspected that the Comrades' Court would delay production, and some workers mistakenly thought that the Comrades' Court was "rectifying workers." Only after the Comrades' Court carried out in-depth and extensive publicity and achieved certain results in its work did the cadres and workers dispel their concerns. On the other hand, some units, due to being welcomed by the party and administrative leaders of the factories and mines and supported by the broad masses of workers, developed impetuous emotions and attempted to spread it universally immediately; some Comrades' Courts showed a pure punitive emotion or adopted erroneous methods such as naming names at meetings and arresting people on the spot.

    According to the experience of various regions, to do a good job in establishing the Comrades' Court, it is first necessary to clarify that the Comrades' Court is a mass organization for the self-education of workers, and it is necessary to adhere to the use of mass self-reform and self-education methods to fight against violations of labor discipline and old habits that endanger production, so as to achieve the purpose of educating workers, raising workers' awareness, consolidating labor discipline, and promoting production. Therefore, the process of the Comrades' Court carrying out its work is also the process of carrying out ideological education, and it must implement the principle of self-education from beginning to end, preventing the use of simple and crude purely punitive methods. This is the key to determining the success or failure of the work of the Comrades' Court. The success of the Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine's Comrades' Court in handling the case of Liu Dongxing's absenteeism was because it adhered to the principle of persuasion and education. Liu Dongxing was contaminated with some corrupt and decadent thoughts in the old society, was gluttonous and lazy, and from July 7th to the end of September last year, he was absent from work for 66 days without reason, and often feigned illness to ask for leave. After careful investigation and analysis, the Comrades' Court understood the root of his thinking, patiently persuaded and educated him, and the workers participating in the trial criticized his consistent thinking of violating labor discipline, and specifically pointed out that 66 days of absenteeism resulted in the state producing more than 150 tons less coal, and he also reduced his income. Under such sincere help, Liu Dongxing was very moved. After the meeting, the person in charge of the Comrades' Court continued to talk to him and educate him, and Liu Dongxing did not absent himself from work after that. However, some Comrades' Courts did not implement the principle of persuasion and education, and adopted a form similar to "struggle sessions" when dealing with employees' violations of labor discipline, which led to the judged person having pessimistic emotions. Some units also named backward workers at meetings, or took employees who had made mistakes to other factories to participate in the Comrades' Court, and these threatening practices are not right.

    The establishment of the Comrades' Court must implement the principle of "focusing on pilot projects and steadily promoting." We should first select state-owned key factories and mines with more serious violations of labor discipline and strong leadership to carry out pilot projects. The working group piloting the Comrades' Court should, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, combine the central work of the factory and mine, widely publicize the nature, role, and scope of authority of the Comrades' Court, and then, on the basis of a preliminary understanding by the workers, carry out deliberation of candidates and select people who have a clear history, have always been active in production, abide by labor discipline, are fair and willing to criticize, and have prestige among the masses as members of the Comrades' Court. The elected members should preferably have more workers than cadres. After the Comrades' Court has been piloted and achieved results and certain experiences through specific activities, it should be summarized, consolidate the results, and then steadily promote it, and resolutely prevent the impetuous and rash advance of eagerness to spread it. Of course, in important state-owned enterprises with strong leadership and serious violations of production discipline, or units that have gained considerable experience from the Comrades' Court, it is also wrong not to carry out pilot projects and promotions.

    Furthermore, the activities of the Comrades' Court must focus on serving production as the central link, and should use the main force to deal with cases of a nature that endangers production, that is, should focus on trying typical cases of violating labor discipline and technical operations, safety regulations, and endangering production. For general disputes among employees, they can be temporarily ignored. Moreover, the cases accepted by the Comrades' Court must be approved or handed over administratively. The disciplinary measures it takes are limited to criticism, education, public condemnation, and ordering apologies. Those who must be given administrative sanctions should be recommended to the administration for handling. In the past, the scope of cases that should be tried by the Comrades' Courts piloted in some areas was not clear enough. For example, the Zhejiang Hemp Textile Factory in Hangzhou City once held a general meeting to try cases that should have been sent to the court, and then arrested them on the spot before sending them to the court. Once they handled eleven cases, four of which should have been sent to the court. This can easily lead workers to have an incorrect understanding of the Comrades' Court, and at the same time, it distracts the Comrades' Court.

    Also, before the trial, the Comrades' Court must carefully check the materials, clarify the facts, and talk to the defendants individually, patiently helping them to get their thinking straight and dispel their concerns. At the general assembly trial, it is necessary to be realistic, have a sincere attitude, proceed from education, focus on the trial, combine it with mass criticism, and organize speeches in a leadership manner, and appropriately explain incorrect opinions of the masses when making a ruling. After the trial, the factory and mine party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must continue to carry out ideological education work, preventing the trial of the defendant from being completed in one trial, but actively helping him to formulate a personal production plan and point out the direction of his efforts. If he has made a slight change, he should be encouraged in a timely manner; if his change is more significant, if he has been subjected to administrative sanctions, it is recommended that the administration promptly cancel his sanctions. At the same time, after the trial, workers should immediately be organized to hold discussions and study and improve the group production plan and establish a system to promote production. Some units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine have basically mastered these links, so the results are relatively large.

    建立生产企业同志审判会应注意的几个问题
    司宣
    生产企业同志审判会（以下简称同志审判会）是职工自我教育的群众组织。自从去年三月鞍山钢铁公司首先建立同志审判会以来，许多省、市人民法院也先后派出工作组，深入一些领导较强的国营厂矿企业，重点试建了同志审判会。截至今年五月底为止，东北的鞍山、抚顺、本溪、沈阳、旅大，华北的唐山、天津，西北的西安、咸阳、兰州，中南的武汉、萍乡和华东的杭州等地厂矿企业共建立了七十个同志审判会。试建一年多来的情况证明，同志审判会对提高工人觉悟、巩固劳动纪律、推动生产、遵守技术操作和保安规程、防止责任事故等都起了显著作用。鞍山钢铁公司运输部装卸科第三和第五两队，原来每月出勤率经常是百分之八十，通过同志审判会的宣传和教育，加上其他宣传工作和组织工作的影响，第三队出勤率增加到百分之九十八以上，第五队增加到百分之九十九以上，扭转了过去不能完成装卸任务的现象。旅大度量衡仪器工厂经同志审判会处理了工人贾善宝私自挪用工人储蓄金案和其他违反劳动纪律的案件以后，帮助该厂整顿了劳动纪律，经常超额完成任务。贾善宝本人也改正了错误，而且生产成绩突破全厂纪录。另外在许多厂矿中，由于同志审判会的教育，职工间不团结现象减少了，生产积极性也进一步提高。这些例子生动地说明了同志审判会的作用和意义。
    但由于建立同志审判会是一个新的工作，某些厂矿领导干部和职工们对它的性质、作用还认识不够。有的厂矿领导干部对试建同志审判会，认为只是“法院搞试点”，“与自己关系不大”。有的甚至认为搞同志审判会“要耽误生产”。某工厂在试建同志审判会时，起初领导方面认为自己只是“帮助”而已，有的干部也怀疑同志审判会要耽误生产，有的工人则误认为同志审判会是“整工人的”。同志审判会经过深入广泛的宣传并在工作中取得一定成绩以后，干部和职工才解除了顾虑。另一方面，有的单位在试建同志审判会中由于受到厂矿党、行政领导干部的欢迎和职工群众的拥护，又产生急躁情绪，企图马上普遍铺开；有的同志审判会则表现了单纯的惩办情绪，或采用大会点名、当场逮捕等错误的办法。
    根据各地经验，要做好建立同志审判会的工作，首先必须明确同志审判会是职工自我教育的群众组织，必须坚持运用群众自我感化、自我教育的方法，和违反劳动纪律、危害生产的旧习惯残余作斗争，以达到教育职工、提高职工觉悟、巩固劳动纪律和推动生产的目的。因此，同志审判会进行工作的过程，也就是进行思想教育工作的过程，必须自始至终贯彻自我教育方针，防止采用简单粗暴的单纯惩办的方法。这是决定同志审判会工作成功与失败的关键。唐山开滦煤矿的同志审判会处理刘东兴旷工案件的成功，就因为是坚持了感化、教育的方针。刘东兴在旧社会沾染了一些腐化堕落思想，好吃懒做，自去年七月七日到九月底无故旷工六十六天，经常装病请假。同志审判会经过仔细调查、分析，了解了他的思想根源，对他耐心说服教育，并由参加审判会的职工对他一贯违反劳动纪律的思想作了批判，又具体指出旷工六十六天使国家少生产一百五十余吨煤，自己也减少了收入。在这样诚恳的帮助下，刘东兴非常感动。会后同志审判会负责同志又不断找他谈话，进行教育，刘东兴以后就不旷工了。但是有的同志审判会没有贯彻感化教育的方针，在处理职工违反劳动纪律等问题时，采取了类似“斗争会”的形式，以致被审判者产生悲观情绪。还有的单位在大会上点落后工人的名，或者带着犯过错误的职工到别的厂子参加同志审判会，这些带有威胁性的作法都是不对的。
    同志审判会的建立，必须贯彻“重点试建、稳步推行”的方针。应该先选择国营重要工矿企业中违反劳动纪律现象较严重而领导力量又较强的单位进行试建。试建同志审判会的工作组要在党委统一领导下，结合厂矿中心工作，广泛宣传同志审判会的性质、作用和职权范围等以后，在职工群众有了初步认识的基础上进行酝酿候选人，选出历史清楚、一贯生产积极、遵守劳动纪律、办事公正而勇于批评、并在群众中有威信的人作为同志审判会委员。当选的委员最好是工人多于干部。已经试建了同志审判会并通过具体活动，取得成绩和一定经验以后，就应该加以总结，巩固了成果再稳步推行，切实防止急于铺开的急躁冒进情绪。当然在领导力量较强而违反生产纪律较严重的重要国营企业中，或已获得同志审判会的相当经验的单位，而不去进行试建和推广，也是应该反对的。
    再就是同志审判会的活动必须抓紧为生产服务这一中心环节，应该用主要力量去处理危害生产性质的案件，即应该着重审判违反劳动纪律和技术操作、保安规程以及危害生产的典型案件。对于职工间的一般纠纷，可以暂不处理。而且同志审判会受理的案件必须是行政上批准或交付的。它所采取的处分办法，限于批评教育、当众谴责和责令道歉等。必须给以行政处分的，应该建议行政去处理。过去有的地区试建的同志审判会，对应该审判的案件范围不够明确。如杭州市的浙江麻纺织厂曾经把应该送法院处理的案件，先经过同志审判会开大会审理，然后当场逮捕，才送交法院。有一次他们处理了十一件案，其中四件就是应该送交法院的。这样很容易使职工群众对同志审判会产生不正确的认识，同时也使同志审判会分散了力量。
    还有，同志审判会在审判前，必须认真查对材料，弄清事实，并找被审人个别谈话，耐心帮助他们搞通思想，解除顾虑。在大会审判时，必须实事求是、态度诚恳，从教育出发，以审判为主、结合群众的批判，有领导地组织发言，对群众不正确的意见，在裁定时加以适当解释。在审判以后，厂矿党、行政、工会和青年团必须继续进行思想教育工作，防止对被审人一审了事，而要积极帮助他制订个人生产计划并指出努力方向。如他稍有转变，就应该及时鼓励；在他转变较显著时，如果他曾受过行政处分，则建议行政上及时取消他的处分。同时，在审判以后应即有计划地组织职工群众座谈讨论，并研究改进小组生产计划和建立制度，以推进生产。鞍山钢铁公司有的单位和唐山开滦煤矿等处的同志审判会基本上掌握了这几个环节，所以收效比较大。
