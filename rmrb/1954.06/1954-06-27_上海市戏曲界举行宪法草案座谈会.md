    Shanghai Opera Circle Holds Symposium on Draft Constitution
    Recently, the Shanghai opera circle held a symposium on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Many opera artists spoke freely about their feelings on the Draft Constitution based on their personal experiences.
    Hu Opera actress Wang Xiuying said, "Since liberation, the People's Government has continuously educated and cultivated me, enabling me to gradually become literate from being illiterate. Now, I also understand that the Constitution is our fundamental law. The state has promulgated the Draft Constitution and wants us to fully study and discuss it. This is truly a constitution for the people." Peking Opera actor Li Ruchun said, "During the reactionary rule, I performed 'Wu Song and Pan Jinlian.' Because I recited the line 'That Ximen Qing has money, power, and an yamen to support him; the yamen, ah, is not for us poor people,' speaking the truth for the working people, the reactionaries punished me by suspending my performance. At that time, the 'law' was in the hands of a few people." The actresses recalled how Xiao Danggui was forced to death by bullies in the old society, how Chen Yuanyuan was stabbed to death by gangsters, and how Zhou Caizhen was forced to commit suicide by poisoning. They said: In the past, women had no protection, and actresses in particular lived painful lives of being insulted and harmed. Now, the Draft Constitution has made clear provisions for the equal status of women. They expressed gratitude to the martyrs who shed blood and sacrificed for the pursuit of these ideals, and gratitude to the state for stipulating women's rights so specifically. Song Zhangqing, a 63-year-old Hu Opera playwright and director, said, "In the past, an artist being 'old' was equivalent to being 'finished.' Who could guarantee that a 'popular star' would not suffer in old age? Now, Article 93 of the Draft Constitution stipulates assistance and care for workers in their old age. The word 'old' will no longer be terrifying in our country. Some time ago, I saw in the newspaper that there are more than 50,000 people in our country between the ages of 80 and 100, and more than 280 people over 100 years old. I want to work for another 30 years to see a more beautiful and happier society." In discussing the Draft Constitution, opera artists all expressed that they would do a good job in publicizing the Draft Constitution. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海市戏曲界举行宪法草案座谈会
    上海市戏曲界最近举行了中华人民共和国宪法草案座谈会，许多戏曲界艺人从他们切身的遭遇中畅谈他们对宪法草案的感想。
    沪剧演员汪秀英说：“解放以来，人民政府不断对我进行教育，培植我，使我从不识字而渐渐识字；现在，也懂得了宪法是我们的根本大法。国家公布了宪法草案，还要叫我们充分研究、讨论。这真正是人民的宪法。”京剧演员李如春说：“在反动派统治时代，我演‘武松与潘金莲’，因为念了‘那西门庆他有钱、有势、有官衙替他撑腰；衙门哪，不是为咱们穷人设的’这句台词，替劳动人民说出了心里的话，反动派就罚我停演。那时候的
  ‘法律’是操在少数人手里的。”女演员们追忆起在旧社会里被恶霸逼死的筱丹桂、被流氓用刀刺死的陈媛媛、以及被迫服毒自杀的周彩贞。她们说：过去，妇女没有保障，女演员尤其是在被侮辱和被损害中过着痛苦的日子，现在，宪法草案对妇女的平等地位已作了明确规定。她们表示感激为追求这些理想而流血牺牲的先烈们，感激国家把妇女的权利规定得这样具体。六十三岁的沪剧编导宋掌轻说：“过去一个艺人‘老了’就等于‘完了’，‘红角儿’谁能保得定老来不苦。现在，宪法草案第九十三条规定了对劳动者在年老时的帮助和照顾，‘老’这个字眼在我们国家里将不再是可怕的了。我前些时看到报上登着，我国八十岁到一百岁的老人有五万多个，一百岁以上的有二百八十多人。我要再劳动三十多年，看看更美丽更幸福的社会。”戏曲艺人们在讨论宪法草案中都表示要很好地做好宪法草案的宣传工作。　（新华社）
