Xinhua News Agency, June 15th Dispatch from Paris: The People's Assembly for Independence and Peace was held at the Winter Velodrome in Paris on June 12th and 13th. Ten thousand representatives from various provinces of France, with different political beliefs, participated in the assembly.

　　Madame Fajon, a member of the Presidium of the French National Peace Council, addressed the meeting on the morning of the 13th, discussing the significance of the People's Assembly for Independence and Peace. She stated that this meeting was being held precisely at a time when a majority in Parliament condemned the government's policy in Indochina and condemned the attitude of the French delegation at the Geneva Conference. Madame Fajon said that this was the result of pressure from public opinion, which had fully recognized that French independence could not be achieved without peaceful negotiation.

　　The Socialist Halleystein cited impressive figures to show that the movement for peace in Indochina and against the rearmament of West Germany had been widely launched in the Bouches-du-Rhône. In Marseille, 400,000 people signed a petition demanding an immediate end to the war in Vietnam, and in the same province, hundreds of thousands of residents signed a petition protesting against the organization of the "European Army."

　　Among those who spoke at the meeting were the famous French scientist and Nobel Prize winner Irène Joliot-Curie; National Assembly member of the Progressive Republican Alliance, Sibert de Chambelland; Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, Pierre Le Brun; and writer Vercors, among others.

　　The assembly unanimously adopted an Open Letter to the People at the end, which stated: France is now standing at a crossroads leading to war or peace. Tomorrow, it may be thrown into a major war that breaks out in Asia. Germany may drag it into a new war in Europe.

　　In order to prevent the French government from pursuing a foreign policy and to put France on the path to peace, national unity must be established. France can only guarantee its security and resume the role played by a peace-loving country by making all decisions independently.

　　The Open Letter stated: The French people must demand: rejection of the "European Defence Community" treaty; settlement of the German question through negotiation; establishment of a collective security system for all European countries; realization of a ceasefire and political settlement in Indochina, so that the people of Indochina can freely choose their system and their government; cessation of atomic weapons tests and prohibition of their use; and reaching a just agreement on the issue of disarmament. The Open Letter said that this is the will of the vast majority of the French people.

　　The People's Assembly for Independence and Peace called on all French men and women to hold a National Peace Day on July 11th. On this day, the people must express their will for peace to their members of parliament, members of provincial councils, and members of municipal committees, as well as representatives of national authorities, and demand that this will should be reflected in the government's actions.

    法国举行争取独立与和平人民大会
    大会号召建立全国团结使法国走上和平的道路
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：六月十二日和十三日，在巴黎冬季赛车场举行了争取独立与和平人民大会，参加大会的有来自法国各省的不同政治信仰的一万名代表。
    法国全国和平理事会主席团委员法奇夫人在十三日上午会议上致词时，谈到争取独立与和平人民大会的意义。她说，举行这次会议，正是在议会大多数谴责政府在印度支那的政策，谴责法国代表团在日内瓦会议上采取的态度的时候。法奇夫人说，这是舆论施加压力的结果，舆论已经充分认识到：没有和平协商，就不能实现法国的独立。
    社会党人哈累斯坦举出了给人深刻印象的数字，说明要求印度支那和平、反对重新武装西德的运动已在罗尼河口省广泛展开。在马赛，有四十万人在要求立刻结束越南战争的呼吁书上签了名，在同一省内有几十万居民在抗议组织“欧洲军”的呼吁书上签了名。
    在会上发言的还有著名的法国科学家、诺贝尔奖金得奖人伊伦·约里奥—居里；国民议会进步共和联盟议员希伯尔·德香布兰；法国总工会书记皮埃尔·勒布朗；作家维尔高尔等人。
    大会最后一致通过了告人民书，告人民书说：法国现在正站在通向战争或和平的十字路口。明天，它可能被投入在亚洲爆发的大战。德国可能把它拖入在欧洲发生的新战争。
    为了阻止法国政府奉行一种外国的政策，并使法国走上和平的道路，必须要建立全国的团结。法国只有独立地作出一切决定，才能保障安全，重新起一个爱好和平国家所起的作用。
    告人民书说：法国人民必须要求：拒绝“欧洲防务集团”条约；通过协商解决德国问题；建立全欧国家集体安全体系；实现印度支那停火和政治解决，使得印度支那人民能够自由地选择他们的制度和他们的政府；停止原子武器试验和禁止使用它们；在裁减军备问题上达成公正的协议。告人民书说，这是绝大多数法国人民的意志。
    争取独立与和平人民大会号召法国全体男女在七月十一日举行全国和平日。在这一天，人民必须向他们的议员、省议会议员和市政委员会委员，以及国家当局代表表示他们的和平意志，并要求这种意志应该反映在政府的行动上。
