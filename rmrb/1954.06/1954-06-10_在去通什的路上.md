    On the Road to Tongshi
 	Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    The People's Comfort Delegation of the People's Liberation Army's truck was constantly burrowing into the forests of the Wuzhi Mountains, with one mountain peak after another receding behind us. Trucks laden with goods came and went in an endless stream.
    Our vehicle, having just climbed a small hill, suddenly stopped. An old woman was standing by the roadside with two girls, gesturing for us to take her daughters to Tongshi to attend the conference.
    Both girls wore black hats and red-trimmed jackets, which were long enough to cover their knees. One could tell at a glance that they were Miao girls.
    They handed a brand-new umbrella and a heavy bundle onto the truck, and then hopped into the vehicle, giggling.
    Some comrades from Hainan Island in the same car told me that these two girls were sisters. One was named Huang Guixiang, eighteen years old; the other was Huang Guili, eleven years old. Guixiang had studied for two years in elementary school, and Guili had just started the first grade.
    They sat on our luggage bags, humming songs that I couldn't understand. As the car started, they waved goodbye to their mother, and we waved back. Their mother smiled at us until the car rounded a bend and continued to burrow into the forest. We sat in the car, swaying uniformly back and forth and side to side. I casually asked them:
      "Do you often ride in cars?"
    They looked blank, neither smiling nor frowning, and I realized that we didn't speak each other's language at all. After translation, Guili stuck up her thumb and said:
      "Yes, the PLA's cars are 'top-notch'." Guixiang also smiled.
    I then asked: "How is your life now compared to the past?"
    Guixiang said: "Like comparing heaven and earth, a crow to a phoenix."
    This kind of answer aroused the interest of the old comrade next to me, who had lived through more than twenty years of war in Hainan Island. He was neither a Li nor a Miao, but in the most difficult days, he shared joys and sorrows with the Li and Miao compatriots and went through thick and thin together. He said: "The history of the Li and Miao compatriots is a history of blood and tears."
    Long ago, the Li and Miao people were driven into the deep mountains, living like savages. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan Island, the Kuomintang troops, like frightened rats, climbed into the Wuzhi Mountains in droves, snatching cattle, slaughtering pigs and sheep, raping women, and killing and setting fires. The Li and Miao compatriots abandoned their thatched huts, fleeing from forest to forest, burrowing from deep mountains into deeper mountains. They wrapped themselves in tree leaves, ate wild fruits, and returned to the life of ancient times.
    Oppression, discrimination, humiliation, and slaughter educated them. In 1943, thousands of Li and Miao men and women rushed out of the forests with sticks, stones, sickles, and muskets, joining the ranks of the Hainan Island people's struggle.
    Many Li and Miao women served as cooks, orderlies, and transporters in the army. Some of them rescued the wounded on the front lines more than once with their children on their backs, and even guarded the positions or charged at the enemy with guns in their hands.
    That's how they persevered under the leadership of the Communist Party until the whole island was liberated, and they liberated themselves.
    After the liberation of Hainan Island, the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region People's Government was established. The Central People's Government allocated hundreds of millions and hundreds of millions of yuan for production relief and water conservancy construction, and they renovated hundreds of thousands of acres of paddy fields. The People's Government also sent cadres to guide them in accumulating fertilizer, weeding, selecting seeds, plowing fields, and harrowing fields.
    They now not only have venereal disease prevention teams and malaria prevention stations, but also large-scale hospitals; they have not only established hundreds of elementary schools, but also normal schools and cultural centers.
    For the bright future of the Li and Miao people, Chairman Mao sent the PLA to split the Wuzhi Mountains, opening up a road to life for the Li and Miao people. New content has been added to the folk songs of the Li and Miao people:
    Oh, the good soldiers of Chairman Mao!
    Splitting open the Wuzhi Mountains,
    We saw the cities outside the mountains,
    We saw the blue sky outside the mountains.
    In fact, they not only saw the cities outside the mountains, they also saw their own cities.
    Tongshi—the seat of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region People's Government—has tall buildings, bright lights, and wide and long streets. The streets have department stores, cooperatives, purchasing stations, Xinhua bookstores, post offices, grocery stores, tailor shops, barbershops, photo studios, restaurants...
    As the old comrade spoke, I recalled the scene of passing through Sandao City yesterday.
    An old Li man told me that there were only three families here before, but what was in front of me was a small town and a bustling crowd. I smelled a strong smell of bricks, tiles, and lime on the street.
    You can no longer see naked people in the Wuzhi Mountains. Men wear long pants, and women wear brightly colored floral skirts. Many people also wear snow-white, large-collared shirts. They all fully understand the meaning of the new life.
    The car was still burrowing into the forest.
    Guixiang talked about the situation of her village's mutual aid group and school. Guili opened the bundle and shook out two brand-new black clothes. Various colors of silk threads were embroidered on the neckline and cuffs, and flowers and butterflies were embroidered next to the buttons. Guili happily compared them to her body and said: "We only wear these when we go to Tongshi for the conference."
    We all gave a thumbs up, praising Guili's new clothes and saying:
  "Top-notch!"
    Guili tilted her head and said, "Mom is making us flower clothes, top-top-notch."
    Guili then took out a small bag of rice from the bundle and said: "To eat after the meeting."
    Guili added: "It was grown in our own fields."
    Guili smiled happily, and we all laughed. The car carried laughter, still burrowing into the forest. At this time, Guili pointed to a vehicle full of goods that drove past us and shouted:
  "Cloth, cloth." She grabbed my shoulder and just stood up when the car suddenly stopped. I swayed, and Guili almost fell on the luggage bag, and everyone laughed even harder. Guixiang and Guili also laughed so hard that they couldn't catch their breath.
    Through the dense forest, I saw several gray buildings. I seemed to smell a strong smell of paint. Tongshi had appeared before our eyes.

### 在去通什的路上

    在去通什的路上 　 本报记者　苗风
    全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团的卡车一个劲儿地向五指山森林里钻，山峰一个接一个退到后面去。满载货物的车辆来来往往，不断头。
    我们这辆车，刚爬上一个小山坡，忽然停住。因为一个老大娘领着两个姑娘在路旁打手势，要我们带她的姑娘到通什去参加大会。
    这两个姑娘都戴着黑色的帽子，穿着镶红边的对襟衣裳，衣裳很长，可掩住膝盖。一看，就知道她们是苗家姑娘。
    她们递到车上一把崭新的雨伞和一个很重的包袱，嘻嘻哈哈地上了汽车。
    同车的几个海南岛的同志告诉我：这两个姑娘是姊妹。一个叫黄桂香，十八岁；一个叫黄桂黎，十一岁。桂香念了二年小学，桂黎刚上一年级。
    她们坐在我们的行李包上，哼着我听不懂的歌。汽车开了，她们向母亲摆手告别，我们也摆着手。母亲向我们微笑着，一直到汽车拐了弯，继续向森林里钻的时候。我们坐在汽车上，齐一地前后左右的摇晃。我随便问她们一句：
      “你们常坐汽车吗？”
    她们似笑非笑地发呆，我才想起，我们彼此的语言完全不通。经过翻译以后，桂黎翘起大拇指说：
      “嗯，大军的车，‘顶呱呱’。”桂香也笑了笑。
    我又问：“你们现在的生活比过去怎样？”
    桂香说：“差得天和地，乌鸦凤凰比。”
    这样的回答，引起了旁边那个曾在海南岛过了二十多年战争生活的老同志的兴趣。他不是黎族人，也不是苗族人，可是在最艰苦的日子里，他同黎、苗族同胞同过甘苦，共过患难。他说：“黎、苗族同胞的历史，是一部血泪史。”
    老远以前，黎、苗族人民被驱赶到深山里，过着野人般的生活。日寇侵占海南岛时，国民党的军队，就像受了惊的老鼠，成群结队地爬进五指山，抢耕牛，宰猪羊，强奸妇女，杀人放火。黎、苗族同胞撇弃自己的茅屋，从森林逃向森林，从深山钻进深山。腰里缠上树叶，采食野果，又回到了上古时代的生活。
    压迫、歧视、污辱和屠杀，教育了他们。一九四三年，几千个黎、苗族男女，举起棍棒、石块、镰刀和火枪，冲出了森林，加入了海南岛人民斗争的行列。
    很多黎、苗族妇女担任了部队炊事员、勤务员、运输员。有些人，不只一次地背着孩子在火线上抢救过伤员，甚至端着枪，守卫在阵地上或向敌人冲锋。
    他们就是这样在共产党领导下，一直坚持到解放了全岛，解放了自己。
    海南岛解放后，海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府成立。中央人民政府成百亿成百亿元地拨来生产救济款、兴修水利款，他们整修了十几万亩水田。人民政府还派来干部，指导他们积肥、除草、选种、犁田和耙田。
    他们现在不仅有了性病防治队，疟疾防治站，而且有了规模很大的卫生院；他们不仅办了几百所小学，而且办了师范学校和文化馆。
    为了黎、苗族人民美好的将来，毛主席又派解放大军劈开五指山，为黎、苗族人民开辟了一条生活大道。黎、苗族人民的民谣里又添上了新的内容：
    毛主席的好战士啊！
    劈开了五指山，
    我们看到了山外的城市，
    我们看到了山外的青天。
    其实，他们不仅看到了山外的城市，他们也看到了自己的城市。
    通什——海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府所在地，这里盖起了高大的楼房，亮起了电灯，修建了又宽又长的街市。街市上有百货公司、合作社、购货站、新华书店、邮局、杂货铺、裁缝铺、理发馆、照像馆、饭铺……。
    老同志讲到这里，我回忆起了昨天路过三道市的情景。
    一个黎族老大爷告诉我，这里原来只有三家人，可是摆在我面前的已是一个小市镇和熙熙攘攘的人群。我在街市上曾闻到了强烈的砖瓦和石灰的气味。
    在五指山区再也看不到赤身裸体的人了。男人们穿起了长裤，女人们穿起了颜色鲜艳的花裙。有许多人还穿上了洁白的大翻领衬衣。她们都完全懂得了新的生活的意义。
    汽车还是一个劲儿地向森林里钻。
    桂香讲着她村互助组和学校的情形。桂黎打开了包袱，抖出了两件崭新的黑色的衣服。领口上、袖口上绣着各种颜色的水线，钮扣旁边绣着花和蝴蝶。桂黎高兴的在身上比了又比说：“我们到了通什开大会时才穿呢。”
    我们都伸出大拇指，夸耀桂黎的新衣裳说：
  “顶呱呱！”
    桂黎歪着头说：“妈妈正给我们做花衣服，顶顶呱呱。”
    桂黎又从包袱里拿出了一小口袋大米说：“开会以后吃。”
    桂黎补充一句：“是我们在自己地里种的。”
    桂黎高兴地笑了，我们大伙都笑了。汽车载着笑声，还是一个劲地向森林里钻。这时，桂黎指着从我们旁边驶过去的一个满载着货物的车辆叫着：
  “布，布。”她扶着我的肩膀刚站起来，忽然停车。我一摇晃，桂黎差点摔倒在行李包上，大家更笑得厉害了，桂香、桂黎也笑得喘不过气来。
    透过那密密的树林，我看到了几座灰色的楼房。仿佛闻到了强烈的油漆味儿。通什已出现在眼前。
