Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 25th: Over 1,300 representatives from all circles in Pyongyang held a rally on the 24th to commemorate the "June 25th" Day of Struggle Against American Imperialism.

    Present at the meeting were Korean Party and government leaders Park Jung-ae, Choi Yong-kun, Park Chang-ok, Kim Il, Jung Il-ryong, Park Ui-wan, heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, senior generals and combat heroes of the Korean People's Army, and others.

    A delegation of 50 representatives from the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Deputy Commander Yang Yong, was invited to attend the meeting.

  Gan Yetao, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, and other diplomatic officials from fraternal countries stationed in Korea were also invited to attend the meeting.

    Choi Yong-kun, Vice-Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defense of Korea, gave a report at the meeting. He said: American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea four years ago. Under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, and with the direct assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the support of international democratic forces, our Korean people and army defeated the American aggressors and achieved the victory of the armistice. This victory not only defended our people's democratic system and democratic base but also made a significant contribution to consolidating peace in Asia and the world. After the armistice, the Korean people have risen up to carry out reconstruction work and continue to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. At the Geneva Conference, the delegations of our country, the Soviet Union, and China made their utmost efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but due to the conspiratorial sabotage of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang, the discussion of this issue did not yield positive results. American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang have recently been intensifying their arms expansion and manufacturing a series of military conspiracies. With the support of the entire peace and democracy camp, the Korean people are watching the provocative conspiracies of the American-Rhee gang and are determined to work hard to consolidate the Korean armistice, strive for the victorious completion of the three-year plan for the economic recovery and development of the Korean people, and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. If American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang dare to launch a war of aggression again, we will certainly inflict an even heavier blow on them.

    General Yang Yong, the chief representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, then spoke. He first extended warm congratulations to the meeting. He then said: The discussion on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference failed to reach any agreement due to the unreasonable sabotage of the American authorities. Facing this situation, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in addition to continuing to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life, are determined to continuously work hard to improve their military, political, and cultural levels, maintain constant vigilance, and, together with the Korean people, continue to fight to the end for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, for the defense of the socialist construction of the motherland, and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.

    The meeting concluded in song.

    平壤市各界代表举行集会
    纪念朝鲜人民反侵略战争四周年
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】平壤市各界代表一千三百多人二十四日举行集会，纪念“六·二五”反对美帝国主义斗争日。
    参加大会的有朝鲜党、政首长朴正爱、崔庸健、朴昌玉、金一、郑一龙、朴义琓，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领、战斗英雄等。
    中国人民志愿军代表五十人在首席代表中国人民志愿军副司令员杨勇将军率领下应邀参加大会。
  我国驻朝鲜大使馆代办甘野陶和其他各兄弟国家驻朝鲜的外交官员等也应邀参加了大会。
    朝鲜内阁副首相兼民族保卫相崔庸健次帅在会上作报告。他说：美帝国主义在四年前发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。我们朝鲜军民在金日成元帅的英明领导下，在中国人民志愿军的直接援助和国际民主力量的支援下，打败了美国侵略者，取得了停战的胜利。这个胜利不但捍卫了我国的人民民主制度和民主基地，而且对巩固亚洲和世界和平的事业作了巨大的贡献。停战后，朝鲜人民奋起进行恢复建设工作，继续争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。在日内瓦会议上，我国、苏联和中国的代表团都为和平解决朝鲜问题尽了最大的努力，但是由于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的阴谋破坏，使这个问题的讨论没有得到肯定的结果。美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮最近并在加紧扩军，制造一系列的军事阴谋。朝鲜人民在整个和平民主阵营的支持下，正注视着美李匪帮的挑衅阴谋，决心努力巩固朝鲜的停战，争取朝鲜人民经济恢复发展的三年计划的胜利完成和祖国的和平统一。如果美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮胆敢重新发动侵略战争，我们就必将给以更加沉重的打击。
    中国人民志愿军首席代表杨勇将军接着讲话。他首先向大会致热烈的祝贺，他接着说：日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，由于美国当局的无理破坏，未达成任何协议。我们中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员面对着这一形势，除了继续帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤、恢复和平生活以外，决心不断努力，提高自己的军事、政治、文化水平，随时提高警惕，和朝鲜人民一道，继续为和平解决朝鲜问题、为保卫祖国的社会主义建设、为保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗到底。
    大会在歌声中宣告闭幕。
