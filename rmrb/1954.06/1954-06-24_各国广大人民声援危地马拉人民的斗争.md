Xinhua News Agency report: People around the world are denouncing the U.S. imperialist-backed armed invasion of Guatemala and demanding an immediate end to the aggression against that country.

    The Executive Committee of the Uruguayan Communist Party condemned the aggression against Guatemala. The Executive Committee drafted numerous measures to mobilize the working class and the Uruguayan people to support the Guatemalan people and passed a special declaration to the people. A delegation of women visited the Council of State to protest the holding of the meeting of foreign ministers of the Americas in Uruguay. The General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay decided to hold a general strike on the day the foreign ministers of the Americas held their "consultative" meeting to express their protest, and printed and distributed tens of thousands of leaflets, notices, and slogans condemning the aggression against Guatemala. Amidst the surging public opinion, the Uruguayan House of Representatives passed a resolution on the 21st, after fierce debate, condemning the aggression against Guatemala.

    In Argentina, a major South American country, college students and public opinion unanimously protested the armed invasion of Guatemala. Students at the University of Buenos Aires held a protest rally on June 21, demanding an immediate end to the aggression against that country. The American Students' Federation, representing 14,000 students from Latin American countries studying in Argentine universities, also sharply protested the attack on Guatemala and demanded an end to the aggression.

    In Chile, workers and students continued to hold rallies to protest the aggression of the U.S. imperialists. They burned portraits of the U.S. president and marched in front of the U.S. Embassy in Santiago.

    In Panama, a group of college students raised the Guatemalan flag on the National University stadium on June 21, saying that the flag would not be lowered until the attack on Guatemala ceased.

    The Cuban University Students' Federation is preparing a demonstration, despite a ban by police authorities, to support Guatemala.

    In Ecuador and Bolivia, students also held demonstrations in support of the Guatemalan people.

    Vicente Lombardo Toledano, president of the Latin American Labor Confederation, issued a statement calling on the people of Latin American countries to rise up and support the Guatemalan government. Toledano condemned the interference in Guatemala, arguing that it showed the U.S. government's attempt to overthrow the democratic government of this Latin American country through its mercenaries in Central America. Toledano stressed that the events that took place were not a struggle of Guatemalans against Guatemalans, but an attack by U.S. imperialism, using mercenaries, against the legally elected government of Guatemala. The Latin American Labor Confederation called on its members and other trade union organizations in Latin America to give Guatemala all kinds of support.

    Indonesian newspapers have criticized the U.S.-backed armed aggression against Guatemala. The Indonesian "People's Daily" said on the 21st: "U.S. imperialists are creating a new war by launching a brutal attack on Guatemala, which upholds peace and opposes interference. Nothing is more barbaric and brutal than this attack on Guatemala." The "People's Daily" said: "This is a colonial war. In this war, the United States has shown its barbarity to the world and has been unanimously condemned by the people of the world. This war not only destroys the peaceful life of the Guatemalan people, but also endangers world peace." The newspaper pointed out: "It is the responsibility of the people of the whole world, including the Indonesian people, to stop aggression and punish the aggressors." The "Indonesia News" wrote: "The Guatemalan incident exposed the true face of the United States. The United States completely violated all democratic principles and infringed on the rights and sovereignty of the Guatemalan people." The newspaper firmly believes that the Guatemalan people will eventually win victory in the struggle to defend democratic rights and independence.

    In the United Kingdom, the London District Organization of the Communist Party of Great Britain called on all aspects of the labor movement to demand an immediate "cessation of interference in Guatemala." The Sheffield Area Peace Council and the East Ham Peace Organization (London) also passed resolutions condemning "the attack on Guatemala with the open connivance of the United States" and called on the United Nations to take immediate measures to stop the aggression.

    In the German Democratic Republic, the National Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council protesting the attack on Guatemala by U.S. mercenaries. The National Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation also sent telegrams to Vicente Lombardo Toledano, president of the Latin American Labor Confederation, and the Guatemalan Workers' and Peasants' Alliance, expressing the fraternal support of the workers and trade union members of the German Democratic Republic and their full support for the just struggle of the Guatemalan people.

    In Italy, the Italian National Peace Council called on "all Italian citizens, regardless of belief, party affiliation, or social status, to express in various ways their condemnation of the aggressors and their demand for an end to foreign interference in the Guatemalan people and government." The Council also sent a telegram to Guatemalan President Arbenz expressing its support. Representatives of many peace warrior organizations in Rome visited the Guatemalan Embassy in Rome to express the support of the residents of the Italian capital for Guatemala. In large and small factories in Turin, Milan, Genoa, Venice, Florence, Naples, Palermo, and other cities, resolutions against aggression were passed one after another.

    In Norway, a Nordic country, the bourgeois newspaper "Verdens Gang" published an editorial criticizing the United States for "not being able to escape a share of the responsibility for this bloodshed."

    The Danish newspaper "Information" pointed out that the real reason for the long-term deliberate violation of Guatemala by the United States is that the Guatemalan people confiscated part of the land formerly belonging to the United Fruit Company, a U.S. monopoly capitalist company.

    The Dutch bourgeois newspaper "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant" expressed sympathy for the Guatemalan people's struggle against aggression.
