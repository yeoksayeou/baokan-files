Jubilation on Beihai Lake
	Chang Rong
	On the morning of June 1st, despite the drizzling rain, the atmosphere of festivity at Beihai Park was undiminished. The aquatic celebration for two hundred and eighty naval soldiers and over one thousand six hundred children from the capital was about to begin.
	At exactly 8:00 AM, the public address system broadcast the order from the aquatic celebration headquarters, and hundreds of small boats departed from the three docks at Five Dragon Pavilions, the boatyard, and Double Rainbow Pavilion. Soon, they were scattered across the entire water surface, the snow-white naval uniforms contrasting with the children's bright red scarves and the colorful ribbons in the girls' hair, resembling multicolored flowers blooming on the water from a distance. A decorated pleasure boat, adorned with colorful silk, drifted around the water. From inside the boat, the beautiful melodies of accordions and violins, blended with the children's singing, echoed across the water. This was a cultural group organized by the naval soldiers, specially to celebrate the festival for the children.
	The comrades sitting with me in the same boat were all immersed in this joyful atmosphere. A boat sailed towards us, and a naval comrade on board was teaching a girl how to row, while another girl stared wide-eyed, and a boy wore the naval uncle's hat on his head, striking a heroic pose. Clearly, this child admired everything about the naval uncle, and perhaps he was imagining himself becoming a naval soldier in the future. From the conversation, we learned that this naval comrade's name was Zhang Youyi, who had celebrated with the children at Zhongshan Park until late the night before, and had come here early this morning with his comrades. He loved the motherland, loved the motherland's ocean, and also loved the motherland's children. While rowing, he also introduced the children to life at sea, letting them know that the ocean was not only beautiful but also that life at sea was arduous, and that to be a naval soldier, one must have a healthy body.
	Their friendly and pleasant conversation reminded me of the interviews I conducted with several comrades from this naval unit before "June 1st." They excitedly told me: Contact with the children has become an important part of our lives. Small-scale celebrations are mostly attended by members of the Communist Youth League; for large-scale celebrations, many responsible comrades personally attend. This year alone, we have held celebrations with students from thirty-nine schools in the capital, with a total participation of more than 27,000 students. The children, too, deeply love their naval uncles and aunts, and many children want to invite us to participate in their team days or bonfire parties; if we don't go, the children are unhappy. Sometimes, the children say: "We would be happy even if just one uncle or aunt came to see us!" Finally, they also told me: Maybe we will run into many old friends on the water at the Beihai celebration tomorrow!
	Today, they may not have all met their old friends, but the lofty sentiments of loving the motherland, loving the motherland's protectors, and loving the motherland's new generation naturally made them feel like old acquaintances at first sight.
	The rain grew heavier and heavier, hitting the water surface and splashing up countless bubbles, like a field of budding white flowers. The naval comrades immediately put their raincoats on the children, and some even put their own shirts on the children. At this moment, two boats, in order to avoid the rain, rowed to under the willow trees near the Jin'ao Yudong Bridge, and clear singing constantly came from the boats:
	The enthusiastic motor is singing,
	The driver's mood is so tense,
	The gift to the soldier,
	Is loaded on my car.
	Not afraid of the continuous Changbai Mountains,
	Not afraid of the wide Datong River,
	Not afraid of the enemy's blockade,
	Not afraid of the dark night.
	At once, one could tell that these were the lyrics to "Fly, Heroic Little Gas!"
	These two boats were carrying two female naval comrades and six children. The two female comrades, one named Hong Yajin and the other named Xie Kequn, were both members of the Communist Youth League; the children were Young Pioneers from Baozi Hutong Elementary School, all members of the brigade or squadron committees. The children had wanted to celebrate with the naval uncles and aunts for a long time, but they never had the opportunity. They were so excited when they received the news last night that they couldn't sleep all night. Before the rain got heavy, they sang several songs for the naval aunts, such as "The People's Navy Marches Forward" and "Happy Festival." The naval aunts didn't know how to sing only "Fly, Heroic Little Gas!" but they loved to listen to it, so the children taught them. The children taught very earnestly, and the naval aunts also learned earnestly, and after singing it a few times, they learned it, so they sang it together.
	On the other boat, the naval comrade Qian Ningsun and a boy both liked poetry, so they chatted casually about how to write poems. After that boy recited a section of a poem he liked to the naval uncle, he asked the naval uncle to recite a section of a poem as well. Qian Ningsun then recited spontaneously:
	Seagulls are flying on the water,
	The seawater is rolling with white waves,
	There is a green island on the sea,
	I am standing on the island, holding my gun tightly.
	……………………………
	The rain gradually stopped, and the boats sailed back into the sea one after another, making the water surface even more active. Dozens of boats gathered around the pleasure boat, everyone talking, laughing, and singing together. The six children from the Beijing Opera School had performed for the army and air force uncles and aunts when they were comforting the Liberation Army, and they usually corresponded with the Volunteer Army uncles. Today, they came to celebrate with the navy, so how could they not be happy? They all sang the part of Peking opera that they were most skilled in for the naval uncles and aunts, on the one hand to express their condolences, and on the other hand to celebrate their festival. At this time, the girls—Dong Manhua and Liu Shuwu—were invited up to the pleasure boat by the uncles. Standing at the bow of the boat, they sang to their hearts' content, accompanied by the uncles' accordion:
	The five-star red flag is flying in the wind,
	The victory song is so loud,
	Sing of our dear motherland,
	From now on embark on prosperity and strength.
	………………………
	Yes, the five-star red flag will forever fly in the sky of the motherland, the motherland will become more and more prosperous and strong, and the children, under the education and care of the Party, and under the protection of their Liberation Army and Volunteer Army uncles, will gradually grow up and shoulder the task of defending and building the motherland!

    北海上的欢腾
    长荣
    六月一日早晨，尽管淅淅沥沥地下着小雨，但北海公园还不减节日的气氛。二百八十个海军战士和首都的一千六百多个孩子的水上联欢就要开始了。
    八时整，扩音器里发出了水上联欢总指挥部的命令，数百只小船从五龙亭、船坞和双虹榭三个码头出发了。很快，它们就散布在整个水面上，雪白色的海军上衣，衬着孩子鲜艳的红领巾和女孩子头上各种彩色的发结，远远望去，就好像开放在水面上五颜六色的花朵。一只用彩绸装饰起来的画舫，在水上到处飘游，画舫里不时地传出来手风琴和小提琴的优美的曲调，和孩子们的歌声揉和在一起，荡漾在水面上。这是海军战士组织的文艺组，专为孩子们贺节的。
    和我同坐在一个船上的几个同志，都浸沉在这欢乐的气氛中。一只船向我们驶来，船上的一个海军同志正在教一个女孩子摇桨，另外一个女孩子瞪大了眼睛在凝视着，还有一个男孩子把海军叔叔的帽子戴在自己的头上，做出雄赳赳的姿态。显然，这个孩子羡慕着海军叔叔的一切，他也许在想像着自己将来也做一个海军战士。从谈话中，我们知道这个海军同志的名字叫张友怡，头天晚上在中山公园就和孩子们联欢到深夜，今天一早又和他的战友来到了这里。他，热爱祖国，热爱祖国的海洋，也热爱祖国的孩子。他一边划船，一边还给孩子们介绍海上的生活，使孩子们知道海洋不光是美丽的，同时海上生活也是艰苦的，要做一个海军战士，必须要有健康的身体。
    在他们亲切愉快的交谈中使我想起了“六一”前夕对这支海军部队几个同志的访问。他们兴奋地告诉我：和孩子们的联系已经成了我们生活中重要的一部分。小规模的联欢，多由青年团员去参加；大规模的联欢，很多负责同志都亲自去参加。光今年我们就和首都的三十九个学校的学生举行过联欢，参加的学生共有两万七千多人。孩子呢，也非常热爱他们的海军叔叔和姑姑们，很多孩子过队日或举行营火晚会，都要来请我们参加，不去，孩子们就不乐意。有时，孩子们说：“来一个叔叔或姑姑看看我们，我们也高兴啊！”最后，他们还告诉我：明天的北海联欢，说不定我们还会在水上碰到许多老朋友呢！
    今天，他们也许不一定都碰到了自己的老朋友，但是爱祖国，爱祖国的保卫者，爱祖国新的一代的崇高感情，很自然地就使他们一见如故了。
    雨越下越大起来，打在水面上，溅起无数颗水泡，好像一片含苞的白色花朵。海军同志马上把自己的雨衣给孩子们披上，有的还把自己的上衣给孩子穿上。这时，两只船为了避雨划到靠近金鳌玉蝀桥的杨柳树下，船上不断地传来清脆的歌声：
    热情的马达在歌唱，
    司机的心情多紧张，
    送给那战士的礼物，
    装满在我的车上。
    不怕那连绵的长白山，
    不怕那宽阔的大同江，
    不怕那敌机的封锁，
    不怕那黑夜茫茫。
    一听，就知道这是“飞吧！英雄的小嘎斯”的歌词。
    这两只船上坐着两个海军女同志和六个孩子。这两个女同志，一个叫洪亚锦，一个叫谢可群，都是青年团员；孩子是报子胡同小学校的少年先锋队员，都是大队或中队的委员。孩子们很早就想和海军叔叔姑姑们联欢了，总得不到机会。昨晚得到了这个消息，兴奋得一夜都没睡好觉。雨没有下大以前，他们就给海军姑姑唱了“人民海军向前进”、“快乐的节日”等好几个歌子，只有“飞吧！英雄的小嘎斯”海军姑姑们不会唱，但很爱听，孩子们就教她们学唱。孩子们很认真地教，海军姑姑也认真地学，唱不几遍就学会了，于是他们就合唱起来。
    那边一只船上，海军同志钱宁孙和一个男孩子都喜欢诗，他们就漫谈起诗的写法来。那个男孩子给海军叔叔朗诵了他喜爱的一段诗后，要求海军叔叔也朗诵一段诗。钱宁孙就随口朗诵起来：
    海鸥在水上飞翔，
    海水翻滚着白浪，
    海上有一座绿色的小岛，
    我呀，紧握着枪站在岛上。
    ……………………………
    雨，渐渐停下来，船又陆续驶向海中，水面上显得更活跃了。几十只船都靠拢在画舫的周围，大家一块说着，笑着，唱着。来自北京戏曲学校的六个孩子，在慰问解放军的时候，曾经为陆军和空军的叔叔姑姑们演出过，平常也和志愿军叔叔通过信，今天又来和海军联欢，心中怎么能不高兴呢？他们都把自己最得手的一段京剧唱给海军叔叔姑姑们听，一方面表示慰问，一方面也庆贺自己的节日。这时，女孩子——董曼华、刘淑武被画舫上的叔叔邀请上去，她们站在船头上，伴随着叔叔们手风琴的声音，尽情地唱了起来：
    五星红旗迎风飘扬，
    胜利歌声多么响亮，
    歌唱我们亲爱的祖国，
    从今走上繁荣富强。
    ………………………
    是的，五星红旗将永远在祖国的上空飘扬，祖国将越来越变得繁荣富强，孩子们在党的教育和关怀下，在他们的解放军和志愿军叔叔保卫下，会逐渐地成长起来，肩负起保卫和建设祖国的任务的！（附图片）
