    Herdsmen in Hulunbuir Grasslands to Discuss Draft Constitution

    In the Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, discussions on the draft constitution are about to be fully launched. The Hulunbuir League Draft Constitution Discussion Committee was officially established on the 19th. Considering the vastness of the grasslands and the scattered residences of herdsmen of various ethnic groups, the plan is to use the Nadam Fair and Aobao Fair (gatherings for herdsmen to trade and entertain) held in various banners, sums (districts), and bagas (villages) to carry out publicity. Then, herdsmen will be organized to discuss by baga, striving for wide and in-depth coverage, making it known to every household. This will enable people of all ethnic groups to understand the main content of the draft constitution and its close relationship to them, fully promote democracy, and put forward opinions. The committee has also studied how to carry out publicity and discussions on the draft constitution in cities, forest areas, agricultural areas, and among the concentrated Ewenki, Korean, and other ethnic minorities. The work of discussing the draft constitution throughout the league will be fully launched in early July. (Xinhua News Agency)

    牧民将讨论宪法草案
    在内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上，宪法草案的讨论即将全面展开。呼伦贝尔盟宪法草案讨论委员会已在十九日正式成立，计划根据草原辽阔、各族牧民居住分散的情况，将利用各旗、苏木（区）、巴嘎（村）举行的那达慕大会、敖包会（牧民进行交易和娱乐的集会）等来进行宣传，再以巴嘎为单位组织牧民讨论，尽力做到广泛深入、家喻户晓，使各族人民了解宪法草案的主要内容及对自己切身的关系，充分发扬民主，提出意见。委员会对在城市、林区、农区以及聚居的鄂伦春、朝鲜等少数民族中如何进行宪法草案的宣传和讨论，也进行了研究。全盟的讨论宪法草案工作，将在七月初旬全面展开。（新华社）
