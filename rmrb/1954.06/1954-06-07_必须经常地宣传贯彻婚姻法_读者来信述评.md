It is Necessary to Constantly Publicize and Implement the Marriage Law
— Commentary on Readers' Letters
Yu Zhangrui
Since the Marriage Law implementation movement was carried out nationwide last year, the broad masses of people have been educated on the Marriage Law, and new customs of marriage freedom, equal rights for men and women, and family democracy and harmony have begun to be established. However, due to the uneven depth and breadth of the Marriage Law implementation in various regions, and the fact that some regions have not treated the Marriage Law implementation as a regular task, phenomena such as lack of freedom in marriage for men and women, abuse and murder of women, arranged marriages, and early marriage still exist to varying degrees after the movement ended. Reader Hao Zhenlin said: Li Guosheng, a village cadre in Mingyu Village, Ninth District, Wu'an County, Hebei, arranged for his thirteen-year-old daughter to be engaged to someone and demanded thirteen dan of millet (250 jin per dan). Zhao Hua wrote: In Kouze Village, Sixth District, Gaoping County, Shanxi, many people still spend seven or eight dan, or even ten to twenty dan of millet to buy a wife for their sons. Chen Xing wrote: Li Huaiwa of Zhanghong Village, Sixth District, Xunyi County, Shaanxi Province, forced Li Jincan, who was under sixteen years old, to marry him. The cadre in charge of marriage registration at the district people's government hastily issued a marriage certificate, resulting in the tragic incident of Li Huaiwa killing Li Jincan and then committing suicide. In Tong'an County, Fujian Province, Yunxi County, Hubei Province, and Xiguitu Banner in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, there have been multiple incidents of women being abused to death by their husbands and daughters-in-law being poisoned by their mothers-in-law.

Readers' letters point out that the main reason for the above phenomena is that some county, district, and village cadres still have some incorrect ideas about the work of implementing the Marriage Law. Some of them believe that since the Marriage Law implementation movement has already been carried out, there will not be many problems in the future, and therefore lack necessary vigilance against the poison of the feudal marriage system. Some believe that implementing the Marriage Law is in conflict with the central work and the country's economic and cultural construction. They say: "The central work is very busy, and there is no time to implement the Marriage Law." Therefore, they send people with poor abilities to do marriage registration work to implement marriage policies. Some even believe that implementing the Marriage Law is just a trivial matter between men and women and families, and there is no need to vigorously promote it, and they hold a cold and resistant attitude towards implementing the Marriage Law.

Obviously, the above understandings are incorrect. Implementing the Marriage Law is a long-term and arduous task, which cannot be completely solved by one movement. The Supplementary Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Work of the Marriage Law Implementation Movement Month pointed out: "Marriage and family issues involve every family and everyone. In this regard, feudal ideas and feudal habits are something that has been deeply rooted in people's ideology for thousands of years. This can never be 'eliminated' in a short period of time by using crude methods, but must be gradually eliminated through continuous propaganda and education work (including punishing a very small number of serious criminals) over a long period of time." If the strength of the feudal ideology on the marriage system left over from the old society is underestimated, and there is an impatient mood to solve all problems in a short period of time or in one movement, it is wrong. However, the civil affairs and judicial departments of people's governments at all levels should treat the Marriage Law implementation as a regular task, focusing on combining it with production and the central work, carrying out propaganda and education; doing a good job in marriage registration; correctly handling marriage dispute cases, especially marriage cases of revolutionary soldiers; and conducting regular inspections and summaries to ensure the implementation of the Marriage Law.

    必须经常地宣传贯彻婚姻法
    ——读者来信述评
    余章瑞
    自从去年在全国范围进行了贯彻婚姻法运动以后，广大人民群众受到了婚姻法的教育，开始树立了婚姻自由、男女权利平等、家庭民主和睦的新风气。但是，由于各地贯彻婚姻法的深度和广度的不平衡性以及某些地区没有把贯彻婚姻法作为经常工作，以致在运动结束以后男女婚姻不自由、妇女被虐杀、买卖婚姻、早婚等现象还程度不同地存在着。读者郝振麟说：河北武安县九区明峪村村干部李国生让他十三岁的女儿与人订婚，索取小米十三石（每石二百五十斤）。赵华来信说：山西高平县第六区口则村，仍有不少群众拿七八石甚至一二十石小米的钱给儿子买媳妇。陈星来信说：陕西省栒邑县六区张洪村李怀娃强迫与不足十六岁的李金蝉结婚，该区人民政府负责办理婚姻登记工作的干部草率地发给了结婚证，结果发生李怀娃杀死李金蝉后自杀的惨事。福建省同安县、湖北省郧西县和内蒙呼纳盟喜桂图旗等地曾发生妇女被丈夫虐杀、媳妇被婆婆毒害事件多起。
    读者来信指出，产生以上现象的主要原因，是某些县、区、村干部对贯彻婚姻法的工作还存在着一些错误思想。他们有的认为已经进行了贯彻婚姻法运动，今后就不会有多大问题了，因而对封建婚姻制度的毒害缺乏必要的警惕。有的认为贯彻婚姻法和中心工作、和国家的经济、文化建设事业有矛盾。他们说：“中心工作很忙，没有时间贯彻婚姻法。”因而派一些能力较差的人去做执行婚姻政策的婚姻登记工作。有的还认为贯彻婚姻法只是男女间、家庭间的小事情，不必大力去搞它，对贯彻实行婚姻法抱冷淡和抵触的态度。
    显然，上述这些认识是不对的。贯彻实行婚姻法是长期的艰巨的工作，决不是经过一次运动即可完全解决的。中国共产党中央委员会关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示中指出：“婚姻和家庭的问题是牵涉到每个家庭每个人的问题，在这方面的封建思想和封建习惯，是几千年来根深蒂固地存在于人们思想意识中的一种东西。这是决不能在短期内采用粗暴的办法加以‘消灭’的，而必须是在很长时间内不断地进行宣传教育工作（包括惩处极少数严重犯罪分子），才能逐步地加以清除。”如果对旧社会遗留下来的婚姻制度上的封建思想的力量估计不足，企图在短期内或一次运动中解决一切问题的急躁情绪，是错误的。但是各级人民政府民政部门和司法部门，应该把贯彻婚姻法作为经常工作，有重点地结合生产、结合中心工作，进行宣传教育；做好婚姻登记工作；正确处理婚姻纠纷案件，特别是革命军人的婚姻案件；定期进行检查、总结，以保证婚姻法的贯彻执行。
