Manufacturing New Products to Meet National Construction Needs
    Soviet-style 1616 Lathe
    Workers at the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory celebrated the successful trial production of the Soviet-style 1616 lathe on May 14th with immense joy.
    The 1616 lathe is a medium-sized high-speed lathe. It was manufactured according to the advice of Soviet experts, using the latest Soviet model from 1953. Therefore, the lathe's structure is more precise. Its maximum speed can reach 1,980 revolutions per minute, and the minimum is 44 revolutions per minute. It can change into twelve speeds, and these multiple speed changes can be operated and transformed with ease by simply turning on a button and using a crank.
    In order to put the lathe into production as soon as possible, the workers worked in three shifts day and night, learning and doing at the same time. Regardless of which worker was called upon, they stepped forward. Those not called upon ensured the completion of their normal tasks and provided mutual support. In the trial manufacturing process, they also received great help from Soviet experts.
      Hard Alloy Cutter
    The Dalian Steel Plant's hard alloy workshop successfully trial-produced hard alloy cutters for high-speed cutting. In the future, China's machinery manufacturing industry can gradually use domestically produced cutters for high-speed cutting.
    Hard alloy is different from ordinary tool steel. It has high hardness and strong wear resistance. It is used to cut, stamp, draw, or grind various metals or non-metals, and its efficiency is two to ten times higher than that of ordinary tool steel. Hard alloys are divided into BK and TK types. TK has higher hardness, wear resistance, and heat resistance than BK, and is the only cutter for high-speed cutting. In the past, the TK hard alloy cutters used in China's machinery manufacturing for processing all relied on foreign orders. With the widespread promotion of advanced Soviet high-speed cutting experience in China, the limited imported TK hard alloy cutters could not meet the needs. For a considerable period, many machine manufacturing and processing departments in the LÃ¼da municipality could not implement high-speed cutting due to the lack of TK hard alloy cutters.
    The TK hard alloy cutters produced by the Dalian Steel Plant can gradually meet the needs of the mechanical processing departments in the future.
    After the TK hard alloy cutter was initially trial-produced at the end of last year, the quality was further improved during the trial use. Finally, after appraisal by the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, it was considered to have reached the Soviet quality specifications.
      Heavy-duty Electric Drill
    Workers at the Shanghai private Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory successfully trial-produced a heavy-duty electric drill on the eve of the factory's implementation of joint state-private ownership.
    Electric drills are used to drill holes in steel beams when building factory buildings and bridges with steel skeleton structures. The heavy-duty electric drill trial-produced by Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory this time can drill holes with a diameter of 19 millimeters. The rotor of this type of electric drill must rotate 12,000 revolutions per minute, with a fast speed, so the precision requirements are relatively high. The forty-five rectifier segments, which are the size of reeds in a harmonica, must be exactly the same in size, thickness, weight, and hardness, and must be tightly riveted. Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory had never made such an electric drill before, and other factories in Shanghai that made electric drills only made light-duty electric drills. This large electric drill had never been manufactured before.
      Industrial Steel Paper
    The Mudanjiang Paper Mill, a local state-owned enterprise in Songjiang Province, successfully trial-produced industrial steel paper by learning from advanced Soviet experience. It has now produced thousands of sheets of steel paper, and the quality and specifications fully meet the standards. Mass production can begin from June.
    This type of steel paper is strong and light, and has the characteristics of being resistant to swelling, insulation, oil, and fire. It is suitable for making fuel tanks, primer tubes, cylinder gaskets in the transportation industry, insulation materials in the electrical industry, high-speed silent gears and light axle tiles in the machinery manufacturing industry, various pressure-resistant gaskets, cotton sliver buckets, spools, and bearings in the textile industry, as well as safety helmets for miners, protective masks for welders, travel handbags, and so on.
    In the past, the steel paper needed by China's industry completely relied on foreign imports. With the development of the national industry, the demand for steel paper is increasing day by day. The mass production of industrial steel paper is of great significance.
      Twenty Horsepower Electric Winch
    Following the successful trial production of the electric harrow winch, the Liaoxi Machinery Factory also successfully trial-produced a new type of twenty-horsepower electric winch. Four units have been made, meeting quality standards, and are being prepared for shipment to Anshan Iron and Steel.
    This batch of electric winches is for the new No. 6 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel. Its advantages are its small size and high winching capacity, with each winch capable of lifting 3,000 kilograms. The winch's structure is also the latest. If a power outage occurs, three people can replace the electric power operation.
    All the workers in the factory felt very honored when they accepted this trial production task. They knew that putting the No. 6 blast furnace into production sooner would accelerate the industrialization of our country. During the trial production, the workers worked hard to overcome various difficulties. For example, the processing of the turbine (a major component of the winch) was done entirely using copper material that the factory had not used before. At the beginning, they couldn't find the performance of the copper and the quality was not good. After continuous research by all the workers, the casting method was improved to ensure the quality. The ball bearings used in this batch of machines are all domestically produced. In addition, when test-driving the winch, the factory leadership found that some parts of the winch were prone to personal accidents during operation, and the original design did not have safety equipment. They took the initiative to install four safety covers.
      Electric Spark Machining Machine
    The Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau has several hundred cars, most of which are old and broken. Among the parts of these cars, the main parts that bear the most force and are most easily worn are not only expensive but also difficult to buy. Therefore, a good component is often scrapped due to the wear of one part. In the past, the bureau had used electric welding, metal spraying, and other methods for repair, but spraying could only be performed on round workpieces, and electric welding would reduce the strength of the original parts. Therefore, repair work often encountered great difficulties.
    In order to solve this problem, Liao Shufan, the chief engineer of the bureau, carefully studied the advanced experience of Soviet electric spark machining, and together with Yu Fuchao, a technician from the repair shop, designed and experimented for several months and successfully trial-produced an electric spark machining machine. This machine can emit electric sparks as high as 6,000 degrees Celsius to dissolve various hard metals. Now, the Transportation Bureau of the province is using this machine to strengthen the main parts of automobiles. According to Soviet experience, the service life of strengthened workpieces can be increased to ten to twelve times the original, thus solving the difficulties that the bureau's vehicle repair work could not solve with electric welding, spraying, and other methods. At the same time, this machine can also strengthen the turning tools, reamers, twist drills, etc. used in factory machine shops, or coat workpieces that are not severely corroded with a layer of hard metal to revive waste materials. This machine is also equipped with drilling equipment, which can drill small holes of various shapes in any hard metal, and can drill holes as small as 0.12 millimeters. This machine is cheap to manufacture, costing only ten million yuan for all new materials, and ordinary workers can operate it.
    "514" Type Gear Shaper
    After the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant successfully trial-produced the "532" type gear hobbing machine, it has now begun to trial-produce the "514" type gear shaper.
    The "514" type gear shaper is also a working machine for manufacturing gears, and the products manufactured by it are more precise than the "532" type gear hobbing machine. The "532" type gear hobbing machine can only manufacture external gears and larger gears, while the "514" type gear shaper can manufacture helical gears, internal gears, and more precise gears. In the past, China did not have gear shapers, and the internal gears required by machines were all imported from foreign countries. This time, the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant is trial-producing it for the first time.
    The "514" type gear shaper is being trial-produced according to Soviet drawings, and the specifications are high. At present, the factory's administration is actively carrying out various trial production preparations. The factory organized section and stock leaders, technicians, and workshop directors to study and understand the machine's performance. The construction group of the construction section is starting to formulate process regulations. The carpentry shop has begun to trial-produce a gear shaper model. In order to cooperate with the trial production of the "514" type gear shaper, the factory's trade union club also held amateur technical lectures, inviting Deputy Chief Engineer Mao Wenjing to lecture on the machine's structural performance, etc., so that workers are familiar with the drawings in order to carry out the trial production work smoothly.
