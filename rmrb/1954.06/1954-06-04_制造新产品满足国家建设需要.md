Manufacturing New Products to Meet National Construction Needs
    Soviet-style 1616 Lathe
    Workers at the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory celebrated the successful trial production of the Soviet-style 1616 lathe on May 14th with immense joy.
    The 1616 lathe is a medium-sized high-speed lathe. It was manufactured according to the advice of Soviet experts, using the latest Soviet model from 1953. Therefore, the lathe's structure is more precise. Its maximum speed can reach 1,980 revolutions per minute, and the minimum is 44 revolutions per minute. It can change into twelve speeds, and these multiple speed changes can be operated and transformed with ease by simply turning on a button and using a crank.
    In order to put the lathe into production as soon as possible, the workers worked in three shifts day and night, learning and doing at the same time. Regardless of which worker was called upon, they stepped forward. Those not called upon ensured the completion of their normal tasks and provided mutual support. In the trial manufacturing process, they also received great help from Soviet experts.
      Hard Alloy Cutter
    The Dalian Steel Plant's hard alloy workshop successfully trial-produced hard alloy cutters for high-speed cutting. In the future, China's machinery manufacturing industry can gradually use domestically produced cutters for high-speed cutting.
    Hard alloy is different from ordinary tool steel. It has high hardness and strong wear resistance. It is used to cut, stamp, draw, or grind various metals or non-metals, and its efficiency is two to ten times higher than that of ordinary tool steel. Hard alloys are divided into BK and TK types. TK has higher hardness, wear resistance, and heat resistance than BK, and is the only cutter for high-speed cutting. In the past, the TK hard alloy cutters used in China's machinery manufacturing for processing all relied on foreign orders. With the widespread promotion of advanced Soviet high-speed cutting experience in China, the limited imported TK hard alloy cutters could not meet the needs. For a considerable period, many machine manufacturing and processing departments in the Lüda municipality could not implement high-speed cutting due to the lack of TK hard alloy cutters.
    The TK hard alloy cutters produced by the Dalian Steel Plant can gradually meet the needs of the mechanical processing departments in the future.
    After the TK hard alloy cutter was initially trial-produced at the end of last year, the quality was further improved during the trial use. Finally, after appraisal by the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, it was considered to have reached the Soviet quality specifications.
      Heavy-duty Electric Drill
    Workers at the Shanghai private Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory successfully trial-produced a heavy-duty electric drill on the eve of the factory's implementation of joint state-private ownership.
    Electric drills are used to drill holes in steel beams when building factory buildings and bridges with steel skeleton structures. The heavy-duty electric drill trial-produced by Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory this time can drill holes with a diameter of 19 millimeters. The rotor of this type of electric drill must rotate 12,000 revolutions per minute, with a fast speed, so the precision requirements are relatively high. The forty-five rectifier segments, which are the size of reeds in a harmonica, must be exactly the same in size, thickness, weight, and hardness, and must be tightly riveted. Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory had never made such an electric drill before, and other factories in Shanghai that made electric drills only made light-duty electric drills. This large electric drill had never been manufactured before.
      Industrial Steel Paper
    The Mudanjiang Paper Mill, a local state-owned enterprise in Songjiang Province, successfully trial-produced industrial steel paper by learning from advanced Soviet experience. It has now produced thousands of sheets of steel paper, and the quality and specifications fully meet the standards. Mass production can begin from June.
    This type of steel paper is strong and light, and has the characteristics of being resistant to swelling, insulation, oil, and fire. It is suitable for making fuel tanks, primer tubes, cylinder gaskets in the transportation industry, insulation materials in the electrical industry, high-speed silent gears and light axle tiles in the machinery manufacturing industry, various pressure-resistant gaskets, cotton sliver buckets, spools, and bearings in the textile industry, as well as safety helmets for miners, protective masks for welders, travel handbags, and so on.
    In the past, the steel paper needed by China's industry completely relied on foreign imports. With the development of the national industry, the demand for steel paper is increasing day by day. The mass production of industrial steel paper is of great significance.
      Twenty Horsepower Electric Winch
    Following the successful trial production of the electric harrow winch, the Liaoxi Machinery Factory also successfully trial-produced a new type of twenty-horsepower electric winch. Four units have been made, meeting quality standards, and are being prepared for shipment to Anshan Iron and Steel.
    This batch of electric winches is for the new No. 6 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel. Its advantages are its small size and high winching capacity, with each winch capable of lifting 3,000 kilograms. The winch's structure is also the latest. If a power outage occurs, three people can replace the electric power operation.
    All the workers in the factory felt very honored when they accepted this trial production task. They knew that putting the No. 6 blast furnace into production sooner would accelerate the industrialization of our country. During the trial production, the workers worked hard to overcome various difficulties. For example, the processing of the turbine (a major component of the winch) was done entirely using copper material that the factory had not used before. At the beginning, they couldn't find the performance of the copper and the quality was not good. After continuous research by all the workers, the casting method was improved to ensure the quality. The ball bearings used in this batch of machines are all domestically produced. In addition, when test-driving the winch, the factory leadership found that some parts of the winch were prone to personal accidents during operation, and the original design did not have safety equipment. They took the initiative to install four safety covers.
      Electric Spark Machining Machine
    The Hunan Provincial Transportation Bureau has several hundred cars, most of which are old and broken. Among the parts of these cars, the main parts that bear the most force and are most easily worn are not only expensive but also difficult to buy. Therefore, a good component is often scrapped due to the wear of one part. In the past, the bureau had used electric welding, metal spraying, and other methods for repair, but spraying could only be performed on round workpieces, and electric welding would reduce the strength of the original parts. Therefore, repair work often encountered great difficulties.
    In order to solve this problem, Liao Shufan, the chief engineer of the bureau, carefully studied the advanced experience of Soviet electric spark machining, and together with Yu Fuchao, a technician from the repair shop, designed and experimented for several months and successfully trial-produced an electric spark machining machine. This machine can emit electric sparks as high as 6,000 degrees Celsius to dissolve various hard metals. Now, the Transportation Bureau of the province is using this machine to strengthen the main parts of automobiles. According to Soviet experience, the service life of strengthened workpieces can be increased to ten to twelve times the original, thus solving the difficulties that the bureau's vehicle repair work could not solve with electric welding, spraying, and other methods. At the same time, this machine can also strengthen the turning tools, reamers, twist drills, etc. used in factory machine shops, or coat workpieces that are not severely corroded with a layer of hard metal to revive waste materials. This machine is also equipped with drilling equipment, which can drill small holes of various shapes in any hard metal, and can drill holes as small as 0.12 millimeters. This machine is cheap to manufacture, costing only ten million yuan for all new materials, and ordinary workers can operate it.
    "514" Type Gear Shaper
    After the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant successfully trial-produced the "532" type gear hobbing machine, it has now begun to trial-produce the "514" type gear shaper.
    The "514" type gear shaper is also a working machine for manufacturing gears, and the products manufactured by it are more precise than the "532" type gear hobbing machine. The "532" type gear hobbing machine can only manufacture external gears and larger gears, while the "514" type gear shaper can manufacture helical gears, internal gears, and more precise gears. In the past, China did not have gear shapers, and the internal gears required by machines were all imported from foreign countries. This time, the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant is trial-producing it for the first time.
    The "514" type gear shaper is being trial-produced according to Soviet drawings, and the specifications are high. At present, the factory's administration is actively carrying out various trial production preparations. The factory organized section and stock leaders, technicians, and workshop directors to study and understand the machine's performance. The construction group of the construction section is starting to formulate process regulations. The carpentry shop has begun to trial-produce a gear shaper model. In order to cooperate with the trial production of the "514" type gear shaper, the factory's trade union club also held amateur technical lectures, inviting Deputy Chief Engineer Mao Wenjing to lecture on the machine's structural performance, etc., so that workers are familiar with the drawings in order to carry out the trial production work smoothly.

    制造新产品满足国家建设需要
    苏式一六一六型车床
    济南第一机床厂职工以无限喜悦的心情，于五月十四日庆祝苏式一六一六型车床试制成功。
    一六一六车床是中型高速车床。它是根据苏联专家的建议，用一九五三年苏联最新出品的式样制造的。所以在车床构造上更加精密。它的最高转速每分钟可达一千九百八十转，最低每分钟是四十四转。它可变十二种速度，而这多种变速，只要电钮一开，用一个摇把便可以操纵变换，快慢自如。
    职工们为了使该车床尽早投入生产，昼夜分成三班，边学边做，不管调着那个工人，都挺身而出；调不着的保证完成正常任务，相互支援。在试造过程中，还得到了苏联专家很大的帮助。
      硬质合金刀
    大连钢厂硬质合金车间试制高速切削用的硬质合金刀成功。今后我国的机器制造业可以逐步使用国产的刀具进行高速切削了。
    硬质合金和一般工具钢不同。它的硬度高，耐磨性强，用来切削、冲压、引拔或磨琢各种金属或非金属，比一般工具钢的效率高两倍到十倍。硬质合金分BK、TK两种，TK比BK的硬度高，耐磨性、耐热性强，是高速切削唯一的刀具。过去我国机器制造业加工用的TK硬质合金刀全靠国外定货。随着苏联高速切削先进经验在我国的广泛推广，有限的入口TK硬质合金刀便不能适应需要了。旅大市不少的机器制造加工部门，曾有一个相当长的时期，因没有TK硬质合金刀而不能实行高速切削。
    大连钢厂生产的TK硬质合金刀，今后就可以逐步地满足机械加工部门的需要了。
    TK硬质合金刀在去年底初步试制成功后，在试用过程中，又进一步改进了质量，最后经中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局鉴定，认为达到了苏联的质量规格。
      重型电钻
    上海私营华生电器厂职工在该厂实行公私合营前夕，试制重型电钻获得成功。
    电钻是在建筑钢骨结构的厂房、桥梁时用来在钢梁上钻孔的。这次华生电器厂试造的是重型电钻，能钻直径十九公厘大的眼子。这种电钻的转子每分钟得转一万二千转，转速快，因而精密度要求较高，四十五个像口琴内的簧那样大小的整流片，其大小、厚薄、轻重、硬度要完全一样，而且要铆得很紧。这样的电钻，华生电器厂从未造过，上海其他造电钻的工厂也只造轻型电钻，这种大电钻也没有制造过。
      工业用钢纸
    松江省地方国营牡丹江造纸厂学习苏联先进经验，试制工业用钢纸成功，现在已生产出钢纸数千张，质量、规格完全合乎标准，从六月份开始就可大量生产了。
    这种钢纸质坚而轻，具有抗胀、绝缘、抗油、耐燃等特点，适于做运输工业上的油箱、引火管、汽缸垫及电器工业方面的绝缘材料、机械制造工业的高速无声齿轮、轻轴瓦、各种耐压垫片及纺织工业用的棉条桶、线轴、轴承以及矿工用的安全帽、电焊工用的防护面具、旅行手提包等等。
    过去我国工业需要的钢纸，完全依靠国外进口，随着国家工业的发展，钢纸的需要量日益增多，工业钢纸的大量生产，是有着很重要的意义的。
      二十马力电动卷扬机
    辽西机械一厂，继电耙子卷扬机试制成功以后，又试制成功了一种新式的二十马力电动卷扬机，现已做出四台，合乎质量标准，正准备运往鞍钢。
    这批电动卷扬机是给鞍钢新建的六号炼铁炉用的。它的优点是体积小，卷扬能力高，每次可卷重三千公斤。卷扬机的构造也是最新式的，如果遇到停电事故，用三个人力便可以代替电力操作。
    该厂全体职工在接受这一试制任务时，都感到很光荣。他们知道六号炼铁炉早一天投入生产，也就能加速我们国家的工业化。在试制当中，职工们努力克服了种种困难。如加工涡轮（卷扬机上的一个主要部件），完全使用过去该厂没有做过的铜料，开始做找不准铜的性能，质量不好，经过全体职工的不断研究，改进了铸造方法，保证了质量。这批机器使用的滚珠，都是本国出品。另外，试车时该厂领导上发现卷扬机上有的地方运转时容易发生人身事故，原设计没有安全设备，他们主动的给安装了四个安全罩。
      电花加工机
    湖南省运输局现有的几百辆汽车多已破旧，这些汽车机件中，受力最大和最易磨损的几项主要零件，不但价格高昂，而且不容易买到，因此，往往由于一个零件受到磨损，而使很好的部件整个报废了。过去，该局虽采用过电焊，金属喷镀等办法进行修理，但喷镀只能在圆形工件上进行，电焊又会降低原有零件的强度，因而修理工作常遇到很大的困难。
    为了解决这个问题，该局主任工程师廖庶蕃认真研究了苏联电花加工的先进经验，并和修机室技术员虞敷潮一起，经过几个月来设计和试验，试制成功了电花加工机。这种机器可以发出高达摄氏六千度的电花，来溶解各种硬质金属。现在，该省运输局正在使用这种机器强化汽车主要零件。根据苏联的经验，凡经过强化的工件，使用寿命最高的可提高到原来的十至十二倍，因而解决了该局车辆修理工作中用电焊、喷镀等办法所不能解决的困难。同时，这种机器还可以强化工厂车工间所使用的车刀、绞刀、麻花钻等，或将腐蚀不大的工件镀盖一层硬质金属，使废料复活。这种机器还同时装有钻孔设备，能在任何硬质金属上钻各种形状的小孔，一直可以钻小到零点一二公厘的小细孔。这种机器造价便宜，全部采用新料不过千余万元，而且一般工人都能够进行操作。
    “五一四”型插齿机
    重庆机床厂在试制“五三二”型滚齿机成功后，现在又开始试制“五一四”型插齿机。
      “五一四”型插齿机也是制造齿轮的一种工作母机，比“五三二”型滚齿机制造的产品精密度更高；“五三二”型滚齿机只能制造外齿轮和较大的齿轮，“五一四”型插齿机能够制造斜齿轮、内齿轮和较精密的齿轮。以前我国没有插齿机，机器所需用的内齿轮都是靠外国输入，这次重庆机床厂是首次试制。
      “五一四”型插齿机是按照苏联图纸进行试制的，规格要求高。目前，该厂行政上正积极进行各种试制准备工作，厂里组织了各科、股长、技术人员、车间主任学习，了解机器性能。施工科施工组正着手制订工艺规程。木工场已开始试制插齿机模型。厂工会俱乐部为了配合“五一四”型插齿机的试制，还举办了业余技术讲座，邀请副总工程师毛文静主讲机器的结构性能等，使工人熟悉图纸，以便顺利进行试制工作。
