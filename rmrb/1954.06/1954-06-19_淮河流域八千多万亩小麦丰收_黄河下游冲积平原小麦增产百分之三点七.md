Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, June 18th: This year, the Huai River basin has once again achieved a bumper wheat harvest. Approximately eighty million mu of wheat were sown in the southern and eastern parts of Henan Province, the northern part of Anhui Province, and the northern part of Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that nearly ten billion catties of wheat can be harvested this year. Although there were heavy rainstorms in the Huai River basin from Henan and Anhui to Jiangsu in mid-May, just as the wheat was beginning to ripen, the majority of the fierce Huai River floodwaters were contained in mountain valley reservoirs or stored in depressions and lakes.

In mid-May, Xincai County in Henan Province experienced a rainfall of 93 millimeters in a single event, Huangchuan County had 90 millimeters, and Huaibin County had 116 millimeters. Because the Hong River and Ru River were dredged and straightened as part of the Huai River project, and the Shimantan, Banqiao, and Boshan reservoirs controlled the floodwaters, there were no breaches or overflows during this period of heavy rainfall, ensuring a bumper harvest of wheat on both banks of the Hong River and Ru River. In Anhui Province, the old Wanghu depression in Suxian County and Lingbi County, covering more than 300,000 mu, used to flood with just 20 millimeters of rain. This time, it received 70 to 100 millimeters of torrential rain, but the accumulated water was quickly drained, preventing any disaster. In Wuhe County, the Hui River and Tuo River, tributaries of the Huai River, used to suffer from backflow and waterlogging from the main stream whenever the Huai River swelled. This year, the water level of the main stream of the Huai River was 1.3 meters higher than the water levels of the Hui River and Tuo River because these tributaries had been diverted from the main stream and flowed directly into Hongze Lake, thus preventing the backflow of the Huai River and protecting hundreds of thousands of mu of crops. In northern Jiangsu Province, because an irrigation canal was dug during the Huai River project, capable of draining 700 cubic meters of floodwater per second, and a drainage canal was also dug along the irrigation canal, with sluice gates built at the mouth of the irrigation and drainage canals where they enter the sea, the northern Jiangsu region received more than 100 millimeters of torrential rain in May, but in many places the land dried up soon after the rain stopped. In some places where water accumulated temporarily, it was drained within two or three days. The wheat on the vast North Jiangsu Plain not only avoided disaster but also achieved a good harvest unseen in the last seven or eight years.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, June 18th: On the alluvial plains of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the 30 million mu of wheat in 57 counties in the four special districts of Heze, Liaocheng, Dezhou, and Huimin, and parts of the Tai'an special district in Shandong Province have generally yielded a bumper harvest. The total output has increased by 3.7 percent compared to last year. After deducting what the farmers need for their own use, agricultural taxes, and wheat for seed, there will be 780 million catties of marketable wheat for sale, which is 370 million catties more than the state purchased in this region in 1953.

Now, the threshing grounds in every village are piled high with wheat stacks larger than in previous years, and the farmers are threshing and sunning the wheat while striving to sell the new wheat to the state as soon as possible. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province have organized the pre-purchase of 193.85 million catties of wheat in these areas, and farmers have begun to deliver new wheat in accordance with the pre-purchase contracts. Under the leadership of seven agricultural production cooperatives, farmers in Nanlin Township, Puyang County, will sell nearly 110,000 catties of wheat to the state this year, which is two and a half times the amount sold to the state last year.

### 淮河流域八千多万亩小麦丰收  黄河下游冲积平原小麦增产百分之三点七

    淮河流域八千多万亩小麦丰收
    黄河下游冲积平原小麦增产百分之三点七
    【新华社蚌埠十八日电】淮河流域的小麦今年又一次获得丰收。河南省的南部和东部、安徽省北部、江苏省北部播种小麦约达八千多万亩，预计今年可以收到近百亿斤小麦。虽然今年五月中旬正当小麦开始结实的时候，淮河流域从河南、安徽到江苏普遍下了暴雨，但是凶猛的淮河洪水大部分被关在山谷水库里，或者被蓄在洼地和湖泊里。
    五月中旬，河南省新蔡县一次降雨达九十三公厘，潢川县一次降雨九十公厘，淮滨县一次降雨一百十六公厘。由于治淮工程中洪河、汝河进行了疏浚整理，石漫滩、板桥、薄山等水库控制了洪水，因此这次暴雨期中没有漫堤，也没有决堤，保证了洪河、汝河两岸小麦的丰收。安徽省宿县和灵璧县三十多万亩的老汪湖洼地，过去只要下二十公厘雨就会淹了，这一次下了七十公厘到一百公厘的暴雨，雨后积水很快排出，没有成灾。五河县浍河、沱河等淮河支流过去每当淮河暴涨，干流的洪水就要倒灌入支流积涝成灾。今年淮河干流的水位比浍河、沱河等支流的水位高一点三公尺，因为这些支流已和淮河干流分流直接流入洪泽湖，因而避免了淮水倒灌，保障了几十万亩庄稼。江苏省北部因为治淮工程中开挖了一条灌溉总渠，每秒钟可排泄七百立方公尺的洪水，沿灌溉总渠又开了一条排水渠，灌溉总渠和排水渠的入海处又都建造了水闸，五月里苏北地区虽然下了一百多公厘的暴雨，很多地方也雨住地干。有些地方一时积水，两三天中也就排出去了。辽阔的苏北平原上的小麦，不仅没有遭灾，而且获得了七、八年来所没有的好收成。
    据新华社济南十八日电：在黄河下游冲积平原上，山东省菏泽、聊城、德州、惠民四个专区和泰安专区部分地区，共五十七个县的三千万亩小麦普遍丰收。总产量比去年增加百分之三点七。除了农民自用、缴农业税和小麦留种外，将有七亿八千万斤商品粮的小麦出卖，比一九五三年度国家在这个地区收购的小麦多出三亿七千万斤。
    现在，村村场上都堆满着比往年大得多的麦垛，农民们正边打场、边晒麦，争取及早把新麦卖给国家。山东省各地供销合作社组织在这些地区预购小麦一亿九千三百八十五万斤，农民们已按照预购合同开始交新麦。濮县南临乡农民在七个农业生产合作社的带动下，今年将卖给国家小麦近十一万斤，等于去年卖给国家的两倍半。
