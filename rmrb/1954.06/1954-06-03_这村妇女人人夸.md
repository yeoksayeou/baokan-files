    This Village Woman is Praised by Everyone
    By Our Correspondent Lu Sheng
    As soon as you enter North Xu Village (which belongs to the Ninth District of Yanggao County, Shanxi Province), you will see groups of piglets and fat pigs. At this time, if you ask anyone in the village: Why are there so many pigs? They will praise the women in their families.
    It turns out that the terrain of North Xu Village is very low-lying, and the water that seeps into the ground every spring is wetter than freshly watered land. If there is a lot of rain in the spring, it is impossible to plant at all. Although the summer and autumn seasons are better, once it rains for two consecutive days in the autumn, the water on the ground cannot seep away. The few scattered crops that have been painstakingly grown are damaged by the accumulated water. Local farmers say that for many years, they have not only had no grain harvest, but even the potato (i.e., potato) harvest has been poor. Before liberation, the farmers in this village lived a life of hunger and hardship all year round. After liberation, many families had to rely on government relief grain to survive. In 1950, out of 319 households in the village, 93 households relied on government relief grain all year round. In recent years, although the crops in the fields are still poor or fail, the lives of the masses have improved year by year, and some families even have surplus money to buy necessary means of production and living materials.
    The early years of farmer Xu Zhanlong's family were simply unbearable. The grain harvested in 1949 was eaten up before autumn. In winter, the whole family drank some coarse bran and wild vegetable soup during the day. At night, Xu Zhanlong's wife, Qu Manyu, and two daughters shared a broken felt blanket, while he himself wore a tattered cotton coat day and night. When Qu Manyu gave birth to her third little girl, she had to wrap her in tattered cotton pants. After receiving government relief grain in 1950, Qu Manyu discussed raising pigs with her husband. They thought: The fields don't grow grain, only wild vegetables and weeds grow, and we can't rely solely on government relief grain. We have to find a way to engage in production. After thinking about it, they came up with the idea of raising sows to breed piglets. So they used part of the government relief grain to buy a small sow. Because Qu Manyu took careful care of the pig, the small sow gave birth to a litter of piglets that year, and two more litters the following year. From then on, their lives improved year by year. The litter of piglets born last summer was sold for 630,000 yuan. Not only did the whole family of five have enough to eat, but each person also had a new single layer of clothing sewn. In the autumn, the sow gave birth to another litter of piglets, which were sold for 720,000 yuan. At this time, in addition to buying a donkey, eight pieces of farm equipment, and some furniture, Xu Zhanlong also sewed a new cotton quilt and a new cotton coat for each of the five members of the family to prepare for the winter. Qu Manyu gave birth to her fourth little girl last year. Before giving birth, she had already made the cotton quilt and small floral clothes. A few years ago, they couldn't afford to eat or wear anything during the New Year. Last year, Xu Zhanlong's family not only bought a lot of good food for the New Year, but also sewed a black twill uniform for his eldest daughter and a floral dress for each of the other three girls. When Xu Zhanlong mentioned his family's good life, he pointed to Qu Manyu and said, "Our family's good life is mostly due to her raising pigs."
    Out of the 319 households in North Xu Village, with the exception of families without women and families with sick or semi-disabled women, the women in 251 households in the village, like Qu Manyu, started raising pigs from 1950, and like Qu Manyu's family, their lives improved year by year. By 1953, the women in the village had raised more than 250 pigs, and except for 13 boars and meat pigs, all were sows. As a result, in that year alone, they gave birth to 4,356 piglets, which were sold for a total of 261,300,000 yuan. Adding their income from raising chickens that year, they bought back a total of 474,390 catties of millet, which greatly improved the lives of the villagers.
    Although the women in this village encountered many difficulties in the process of raising pigs, they actively overcame them. In the first year of raising pigs, the village suffered another flood. Only sunflower seeds and sesame seeds had a good harvest, which posed a difficult problem for them: if people didn't have enough to eat, what should they feed the pigs? Qu Manyu was troubled by this for several days. One day, she suddenly remembered what her mother had told her when she was a child: in famine years, when people had nothing to eat, everyone used sunflower seed cakes to make cakes (that is, grinding the de-seeded sunflower seed cakes into flour and then steaming them into cakes). So she thought: Sunflower seed cake flour can still be eaten by people. If sunflower seed cake flour is cooked into a paste to feed the pigs, the pigs will definitely love it. The next day, she ground the sunflower seed cakes into flour and made a paste for the pigs, and sure enough, the pigs loved it. So she told this method to all the women in the village who were raising pigs, and everyone collected all the useless sunflower seed cakes to feed the pigs. From this time on, their confidence in raising pigs not only increased, but they also paid special attention to the various things that pigs liked to eat. Once they saw pigs gnawing on corn cobs thrown in the yard, they collected the cobs, ground them into flour, and made a paste for the pigs. Another time, they saw pigs gnawing on sesame stalks placed in the yard, so they fried the sesame stalks, ground them into flour, and fed them to the pigs. Because corn cobs have a sweet taste and sesame stalks have an oily quality, the pigs not only loved to eat them, but also gained weight after eating them. In 1950, the village only raised 87 sows. In 1951, it increased to 110. In 1952, it increased to 150. Because they were always mindful of collecting feed for the pigs and prepared various feeds for the pigs in a planned way, it did not affect the breeding of pigs at all. In 1953, even more people raised pigs. At this time, in addition to piglets, boars, and meat pigs, there were 242 sows. They had even more plans to feed the pigs. When wild grass grew in the spring, it was also the busy season for agricultural production. They organized the children in the village to herd pigs in the wild and in damp places. In addition to making two meals a day for the pigs and participating in agricultural production, the women took time to collect various wild vegetables in the wild to prepare feed for raising pigs in the winter. After the autumn harvest, they first fed the grain with sand and the soaked potatoes from the autumn harvest, and then fed sunflower seed cake flour, corn cob flour, sesame stalk flour, and various dried wild grasses and vegetables. Therefore, although they raised more than 200 sows and more than 4,000 piglets, in addition to feeding each sow two dou of sorghum and several dan of rice bran each year when they gave birth, all of them were fed sunflower seed cakes, corn cobs, sesame stalks, and various dried wild grasses and vegetables. The men in this village greatly admire the women. They say, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the women's abilities are really great. They raise pigs without grain, and the pigs still grow fat. Big pigs give birth to small pigs, which benefits both the country and the family."
    The active pig raising by the women in this village has also played a great supporting role in agricultural production. In 1953, each household used the money from selling pigs to add 251 pieces of large and small farm equipment, and also bought more than 20 sheep. At the same time, due to the application of a large amount of pig manure in the farmland, the village achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in 1953. Farmer Xu Shouzheng in the village applied one and a half mu of pig manure to each mu of his 17 mu of land, which increased the yield by six shi dou of grain per mu. The total agricultural income of the village this year was 656,370 catties of raw grain, so the ability to achieve such a harvest, in addition to the villagers fighting against the flood, was also greatly related to the application of more pig manure.
    After studying the general line last winter, the women's political awareness has been further improved. They actively demand that the scattered pigs be concentrated for feeding. Because all the large and small pigs in the village run around the village all day long looking for food, this is not only bad for the sanitation of the village, but also prevents all the pig manure from being completely accumulated and used to increase grain production, and also has a great impact on the breeding of piglets. This spring, under the leadership of the Party branch, they voluntarily organized many pig raising groups based on three or five households on the left and right. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups are preparing to build 40 pig pens first. At present, these pig pens have been built one after another, and the women in the village are developing the village's pig raising sideline in an organized and planned way.

    这村妇女人人夸
    本报记者  鲁生
    一走进北徐屯村（这村属山西省阳高县第九区），就会看到一群群的小猪娃和大肥猪。这时，你随便问这村那一个人：为什么有这么多猪？他就会夸奖起他们家里的妇女来。
    原来北徐屯村的地势很洼，每年春天渗到地面上的水，比刚浇过的地还湿。要是遇到春天雨水多，就根本不能下种。夏、秋两季虽然比较好一些，但是一到秋天，只要连着下上两天雨，地面的水就渗不下去了，这样好容易捉住的几根零星庄稼苗，又被地面的积水泡坏了。当地农民说：多少年来，他们不但没有收获粮食，连山药蛋（即马铃薯）都没有好收成。解放前这村的农民整年是过着饥饿的困苦的生活，解放后不少人家要靠政府发的救济粮才能维持生活。一九五零年，全村三百一十九户人家，就有九十三户是整年吃政府发的救济粮。近几年来，地里的庄稼虽然还是歉收或不收，但群众的生活可一年比一年好起来了，有的人家还有余钱来买必要的生产资料和生活资料。
    农民徐占龙家早些年的日子简直没法过，一九四九年地里收下的粮食没出秋天就吃完了。冬天里，白天全家人喝些粗糠野菜汤，夜里徐占龙的妻子屈满鱼和两个女儿伙盖一条破毡皮，他自己白天夜里是一身破棉衣。屈满鱼生第三个小女孩时，只得用破棉裤包着裹着。一九五零年他们得到政府的救济粮后，屈满鱼就和她丈夫商议养猪生产的事来。他们想：地里不长粮食，尽长些野菜野草，不能光靠政府的救济粮生活，总得想个办法搞生产。想来想去他们想到了喂母猪繁殖小猪的生产上，于是他们就拿政府的一部分救济粮买下一只小母猪。因为屈满鱼喂猪细心，这只小母猪当年就下了一窝小猪，第二年又下了两窝，从此，他们的生活就一年比一年好起来了。去年夏天生下的一窝小猪卖了六十三万元，全家五口人不但有了吃，每人还缝了一身新单衣。秋天母猪又下一窝小猪，卖了七十二万元，这时徐占龙除了买下一头毛驴、八件农具和一些家具外，又给全家大小五口人每人缝了一床新棉被、一身新棉衣准备过冬。屈满鱼去年又生了第四个小女孩，在生前她就把棉被和小花衣服做好了。几年前每年过年吃不上、穿不上，去年过年时，徐占龙一家人除了买下许多好吃的外，又给他的大女儿缝了一身黑斜纹布制服，给另外三女孩每人缝了一身花花衣。徐占龙一提起他家的好生活来，就指着屈满鱼说：“我家的好生活，多半是靠她喂猪得来的。”
    北徐屯村共三百一十九户人家，除了没有妇女的家和有病的妇女，或半残废的妇女的家而外，全村二百五十一户人家的妇女们，都像屈满鱼一样、从一九五零年就开始养猪，而且也像屈满鱼家一样，生活一年比一年好起来。到一九五三年，全村的妇女们，就喂了二百五十多只猪，而且除十三只公猪和肉猪外，全部是母猪，因此在这年单生下的小猪娃就有四千三百五十六只，共卖两亿六千一百三十多万元，加上她们这年养鸡的收入，共买回四十七万四千三百九十多斤谷子，这样就使全村人民的生活大大提高了一步。
    这村的妇女在养猪的过程中虽然碰到了很多困难，但是被她们积极克服了。开始养猪那一年，全村又遭了涝灾，只有葵花籽和胡麻丰收了，这样就给她们出了个难题：人还没有吃的，该拿什么喂猪呢？屈满鱼为这事难为了好几天。有一天她忽然想起小时母亲曾给她说过：过荒年时人没有吃，大家就拿葵花饼子做糕吃（就是把去过籽的葵花饼磨成面再蒸成糕）。于是她就想道：葵花饼子磨成面人还能吃呢，要是把葵花饼子面煮成糊糊来喂猪，猪一定也爱吃。第二天她把葵花饼子磨成面给猪做了一顿糊糊食，果然猪挺爱吃，于是她就把这个办法告给全村养猪的妇女们，大家就都把没用的葵花饼子全收拾起来喂猪。从这时起，她们喂猪的信心不但更高了，而且还特别注意起猪喜欢吃的各种东西来。有一次她们看到猪啃吃扔在院里的玉米棒芯子，她们就把棒子收集起来磨成面打成糊糊给猪吃；又有一次她们看到猪啃吃院里放的胡麻穰子，她们就把胡麻穰子炒了磨成面给猪吃，因为玉米棒子有甜味，胡麻穰子又有油性，所以猪不但爱吃，而且吃了还爱上膘。一九五零年全村只喂八十七只母猪，一九五一年发展到一百一十只，一九五二年又发展到一百五十只。因为她们处处留心为猪收寻食料，有计划地给猪准备下了各种食料，所以丝毫没影响到猪的繁殖。一九五三年养猪的人更多了，这时除小猪、公猪、肉猪外，光母猪就有二百四十二只，她们就更有计划地来喂猪。春天野草长起时，也正是农业生产忙的时候，她们就把村里的小孩们组织起来到野地和潮湿地里去放猪。妇女们除了一天给猪做两顿食和参加农业生产外，抽空就到野地里去采集各种野菜，准备冬天养猪的饲料。秋收后她们先把在秋收中的有砂子粮食和泡坏的山药蛋喂完后，就喂葵花饼子面、玉米棒子面和胡麻穰子面及各种晒干的野菜。所以她们虽然喂了二百多只母猪和四千多只小猪，但是除了母猪下娃时每年喂它二斗高粱和几石谷糠外，全部喂的是葵花饼子、玉米棒子、胡麻穰子和各种晒干的野草、野菜。这村的男人对妇女们都很钦佩，他们说：“在毛主席领导下，妇女们的本领实在大，喂猪不用粮，猪还长的胖，大猪生小猪，利国又利家。”
    这村妇女们的积极养猪，对农业生产也起了很大的补助作用。一九五三年各家农户用卖猪的钱就增添了二百五十一件大小农具，还买下二十多只羊；同时还由于在农田里施下大批的猪粪，就使全村在一九五三年获得了多年来空前未有的丰收。该村农民徐守真在十七亩地里每亩多上一亩半猪粪，就使每亩增产了六市斗粮食。这年全村的农业总收入共折原粮是六十五万六千三百七十斤，所以能够得到这样的收成，除了全村农民和涝灾进行斗争外，和多上猪粪也有很大的关系。
    去年冬天经过学习总路线后，妇女们的政治觉悟更提高了，她们积极要求把分散的猪集中起来喂。因为全村所有的大小猪一到白天就在全村到处乱跑着寻吃的，这样既对全村的卫生很不好，也不能把全部猪粪完全积攒起来用到增产粮食上，同时对繁殖小猪也有很大的影响。今年春天她们在党支部的领导下，以左右邻居三、五户为单位，自愿地组织了许多养猪小组。农业生产合作社和互助组准备先修起四十个猪圈。目前这些猪圈已经先后都修起了，全村妇女们正在有组织地、有计划地发展全村的养猪副业。
