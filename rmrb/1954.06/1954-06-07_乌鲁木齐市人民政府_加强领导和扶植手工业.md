    Urumqi Municipal People's Government
    Strengthens Leadership and Supports Handicraft Industry
    Since the first Handicraft Representative Conference held in Urumqi City, Xinjiang Province in March of this year, the Municipal People's Government and relevant departments have jointly formulated a work plan to support the handicraft industry. State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives have actively supported handicraft producers through the supply of raw materials, organization of processing, and ordering of goods. State-owned commercial departments have successively supplied to the iron smelting, woodworking, leather and other industries more than 20 tons of pig iron, 20 tons of galvanized iron, more than 1,500 various hides, as well as a large amount of wood and hemp rope. The People's Bank has issued more than 280 million yuan in handicraft loans. Cooperatives in Xinjiang Province and Urumqi City organized handicraft production groups in ironworking, woodworking, etc., to process and manufacture a large number of iron shovels, wool shears, plowshares, iron buckets, woodenware and other items.
    Relevant departments have also focused on helping handicraft workers establish handicraft cooperative organizations. Since the city's first Handicraft Representative Conference, handicraft workers in the galvanized iron, woodworking, sewing and other industries have organized more than ten production groups and one sewing supply and marketing production cooperative. Currently, the focus is on establishing handicraft production cooperatives.
    In recent months, the production of many handicraft households in Urumqi has further developed. For example, in the past, galvanized iron workers could generally only make five water buckets or three large basins per person per day. After many handicraft workers in the industry actively improved their technology and promoted the assembly line method, now they can generally make ten water buckets or six large basins per person per day, and the quality also meets the standards. At the same time, labor-management and apprenticeship contracts have been signed in many industries, and the relationships between masters and apprentices, employers and employees, and labor and management have been further improved.

    乌鲁木齐市人民政府
    加强领导和扶植手工业
    新疆省乌鲁木齐市在今年三月召开首届手工业代表会议以后，市人民政府及有关单位共同制定了扶植手工业的工作计划；国营商业和合作社等部门都积极通过供应原料、组织加工和订货等方式，扶助手工业者生产。国营商业部门已先后供应给冶铁、木器、皮革等行业生铁二十余吨、洋铁二十吨、各种皮张一千五百多张，以及大批木料、麻绳。人民银行发放了二亿八千万余元的手工业贷款。新疆省和乌鲁木齐市的合作社组织铁工、木器等手工业生产小组加工制造了大批铁锨、羊毛剪子、犁铧、铁桶、木器等物品。
    有关部门还有重点地帮助手工业者建立手工业合作组织。自该市首届手工业代表会议以来，洋铁、木器、缝纫等行业的手工业者已组织了十多个生产小组和一个缝纫供销生产社。目前，正重点建立手工业生产合作社。
    最近几个月来，乌鲁木齐市许多手工业户的生产有了进一步的发展。如洋铁业过去每人每天一般只能做五个水桶或三个大水盆，经过该业许多手工业者积极改进技术，推行流水作业法，现在一般每人每天可做十个水桶或六个大水盆，质量也合乎标准。同时，许多行业中都签订了劳资、师徒合同，师徒、雇佣、劳资等关系有了进一步的改进。
