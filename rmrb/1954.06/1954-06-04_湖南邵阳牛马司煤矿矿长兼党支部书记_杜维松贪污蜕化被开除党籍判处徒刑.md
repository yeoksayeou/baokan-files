    Du Weisong, the chief of the Hunan Shaoyang Niumas Coal Mine Engineering Office (i.e., the mine director) and secretary of the CCP Shaoyang Niumas Coal Mine Branch, was punished with expulsion from the Party, dismissal from all administrative positions, and a three-year prison sentence by the court for embezzling and stealing state property and seriously violating laws and regulations. Du Weisong was from Huang County, Shandong Province, 31 years old, from a middle peasant family, with a student background. He joined the revolutionary work in 1944 and joined the Chinese Communist Party in the same year. He later served as secretary of the Shaoyang County Committee of the CCP and secretary of the district committee, and was transferred to his current position in June 1951. Du Weisong's criminal facts are as follows:

    In 1951, Shaoyang Construction Company contracted to build the Niumas Coal Mine project and ordered a batch of wood from lumber merchant Shi Guangwei. In 1952, when Shi Guangwei transported the wood along the river to the mine, a flash flood broke out, scattering more than 600 logs and collapsing the newly built Shangche Bridge by the masses. The local people asked Shi Guangwei to compensate for the bridge repair, and Shi Guangwei went to the Niumas Coal Mine to find Du Weisong to request a subsidy for the bridge repair costs. In November of the same year, with the approval of the mine's superior leaders, a subsidy of 2 million yuan in Renminbi was granted. After the bridge was repaired in April last year, Shi Guangwei asked Du Weisong for another subsidy of 2 million yuan. In order to take the opportunity to embezzle, Du Weisong said to Shi Guangwei: "Writing 2 million yuan may not be approved by the higher authorities. You write 5 million yuan, and the higher authorities will approve whatever they approve." Du Weisong personally changed 2 million yuan to 5 million yuan on Shi Guangwei's application for a subsidy, asked Shi Guangwei to rewrite it, and at the same time asked Shi Guangwei to write a receipt for 5 million yuan. Later, Du Weisong forwarded Shi Guangwei's application to Zijiang Industrial and Mining Company for approval. On May 5th last year, Zijiang Industrial and Mining Company replied: "A portion of the subsidy can be appropriately granted." Du Weisong changed the date on the receipt originally written by Shi Guangwei from April 5th to May 5th and withdrew 5 million yuan in cash from the finance department. Soon after Shi Guangwei went to the mine to deliver wood, Du Weisong handed 1.5 million yuan in Renminbi to Shi Guangwei and said: "The higher authorities only approved this much, don't ask any more questions in the future." Du Weisong embezzled 3.5 million yuan in Renminbi. On June 10th last year, when Shi Guangwei went to the Niumas Coal Mine to collect payment for the wood, Du Weisong instructed the cashier Zou Dingcheng to take the opportunity to steal Shi Guangwei's private seal and personally stamped a blank receipt with Shi Guangwei's private seal. In August last year, Shi Guangwei went to the mine again to collect payment for the wood and wrote a receipt for 1.5 million yuan. Du Weisong asked Shi Guangwei to hand over the receipt to him and lied, saying: "There is no one in the finance department now, I will collect it for you, and Section Chief Shen will send it to you later." After Shi Guangwei left, Du Weisong tore up the receipt for 1.5 million yuan, used his left hand to write 4 million yuan on the blank receipt previously stamped with Shi Guangwei's private seal, and signed it with his right hand, embezzling 2.5 million yuan from it. In March last year, Du Weisong went to Changsha for a meeting, and Liu Guanjun, a doctor from the mine's clinic, asked Du Weisong to buy a batch of medicines, handing over 4 million yuan in cash in person. After arriving in Changsha, Du Weisong kept all the cash for his own use and handed the medicine purchase order to Yu Zhongchu, a purchasing agent at the mine's Changsha office, asking him to purchase according to the list with public funds. Later, Yu Zhongchu advanced a total of more than 5.65 million yuan. After Du Weisong returned to the mine, he handed the medicine purchase invoice to the clinic. The clinic paid Du Weisong more than 1.65 million yuan in Renminbi based on the invoice. In this way, all the medicine money of more than 5.65 million yuan was embezzled by Du Weisong. In addition to other embezzlements, Du Weisong successively embezzled and stole state property totaling more than 26 million yuan in Renminbi. Except for 4.5 million yuan used twice to repay the embezzlement and 7 million yuan that was not obtained, the remaining 14.8 million yuan was all squandered by him.

    On November 17th last year, in order to actively raise funds to cover up the embezzlement, Du Weisong began to conspire and plan to steal and sell coke with Shen Yulu, the deputy director of the supply and marketing section. Because the higher authorities decided that the coke produced by the mine was not allowed to be sold externally, Shen Yulu felt that the procedures for selling coke were complicated and expressed hesitation. Du instructed: "Selling coke can be done without issuing invoices, or the invoices can not be transferred to the finance department; you can issue the invoices yourself, and instruct a few reliable people to weigh the coke and supervise it yourself." On December 17th last year, Du Weisong urged Shen Yulu again to steal and sell the coke, and instructed: "If it cannot be sold here, you can go to Shaoyang to sell empty plates, take the money first, and then gradually deliver the goods. I will temporarily use the money to cover the deficit and find a way to solve it later, to avoid trouble with the Industry Department's investigation." Later, Shen Yulu contacted several private merchants outside, but because the private merchants could not pay the price in one lump sum, the theft and sale failed. On December 25th, Du Weisong returned to Niumas Coal Mine from Shaoyang City. When passing through Gaochong Mountain, he personally found a private merchant to sell coke. At that time, it was agreed to sell 29 tons at a price of 310,000 yuan per ton. It was also agreed that the private merchant would come to the mine on January 10th this year to pay for the goods. But at this time, Du Weisong's embezzlement facts had been discovered, and the CCP Shaoyang Prefectural Committee began to investigate his embezzlement facts, so this theft and sale was not successful.

    In order to facilitate his own embezzlement and theft, Du Weisong once used various despicable means to win over Shen Yulu, the deputy director of the mine's supply and marketing section, who had very bad qualities. From 1952, Du Weisong repeatedly approved Shen Yulu's unauthorized borrowing of public funds (Shen Yulu still owes more than 4 million yuan), and sometimes paid off his debts for him, thus gradually making Shen Yulu a tool for Du Weisong to embezzle and steal state property. After the embezzlement facts were discovered, Du Weisong threatened Shen Yulu, saying: "If things get big, you can't get away either, we're all in trouble anyway." And instructed Shen Yulu: "If the leaders inspect in the future, you just say you don't know." In order to use Liu Guanjun, the mine's doctor, to prove that he had not embezzled the medicine money, Du Weisong arbitrarily promoted Liu Guanjun's salary from the 16th grade to the 15th grade and approved relief for his family to lure and win him over. What is particularly serious is that on January 3rd this year, in order to borrow money from private merchant Shi Guangwei, Du Weisong personally went to the Shaodong County Grain Bureau to purchase grain for Shi Guangwei, disregarding the state's unified grain sales policy. Because of the restrictions of the unified grain sales policy at that time, he did not achieve his goal. Since December last year, in order to carry out deceptive activities to cover up his crimes, Du Weisong completely ignored his work. Engineer Liu of the mine once asked Shen Yulu to bring a letter to Manager Ni of Zijiang Industrial and Mining Company (Ni was in Changsha at the time), asking Ni to urge the Xiangnan Coal Mining Bureau to approve the mine's production plan. Because if this plan could not be approved before the rainy season, the mine would not be able to add drainage equipment, and there was a danger of spring rain flooding the well. In order to continue to cover up his mistakes and avoid leadership inquiries and discovery, Du Weisong did not allow Shen Yulu to meet with Manager Ni and instructed Shen Yulu to bring back the original letter. Also, the mine's Party branch and trade union decided to buy a batch of rubber shoes for the workers working underground to prevent their feet from rotting. Du Weisong, disregarding the safety of the workers, took the opportunity to steal all the money for buying rubber shoes and never bought them back for the workers, seriously violating the Party's policy of protecting labor and arousing the workers' dissatisfaction.

    The occurrence of Du Weisong's serious crimes is not accidental. During his tenure as the secretary of the district committee in Shaoyang County, he admitted that he embezzled and stole 1,000 jin of grain and 300 jin of rice from the district peasant representatives' meeting. During the "Three-Anti" movement, Du Weisong had already been transferred to work at the Niumas Coal Mine. He never confessed to his embezzlement before the "Three-Anti" movement. As soon as the "Three-Anti" movement ended, Du Weisong began to embezzle in a planned way. After the criminal facts were exposed, with conclusive evidence, after repeated education, Du Weisong basically admitted the criminal facts, but he still tried to deny some details and individual issues, and was even more unwilling to make a thorough criticism and profound reflection ideologically.

    The Discipline Inspection Commission of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CCP, the Supervision Office of the Hunan Provincial People's Government Industry Department, the Discipline Inspection Commission of the CCP Shaoyang Prefectural Committee, the Shaoyang Prefectural Branch of the Hunan Provincial People's Procuratorate, and the Shaoyang Prefectural People's Supervision Office formed a joint investigation team in January this year and conducted a detailed investigation. Based on various reports, confessions, and the results of the audit, it was confirmed that Du Weisong had consistently embezzled, the circumstances were very serious, and the methods were extremely despicable. It proved that his character was bad, he had completely degenerated and deteriorated, lost the conditions of a communist party member and a revolutionary cadre, and became a criminal who violated national laws and regulations. In order to strictly enforce national laws and regulations and purify the Party's organization, the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the CCP submitted a request to the Hunan Provincial Committee to approve the decision to expel Du Weisong from the Party; the Shaoyang Prefectural Office submitted a request to the Hunan Provincial People's Government to approve the decision to dismiss Du Weisong from all administrative positions and send him to the People's Court for handling according to law. The Shaoyang Prefectural Branch of the Hunan Provincial People's Court sentenced Du Weisong to three years in prison in accordance with the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Embezzlement.

    湖南邵阳牛马司煤矿矿长兼党支部书记
    杜维松贪污蜕化被开除党籍判处徒刑
    湖南地方国营邵阳牛马司煤矿工程处处长（即矿长）兼中共邵阳牛马司煤矿支部书记杜维松，贪污盗窃国家财产、严重违法乱纪，受到开除党籍、撤销一切行政职务并由法院判处有期徒刑三年的制裁。杜维松是山东省黄县人，三十一岁，中农出身，学生成份，一九四四年参加革命工作，同年参加中国共产党。以后担任过中共邵阳县委会秘书和区委书记，一九五一年六月调任现职。杜维松犯罪事实如下：
    一九五一年邵阳建筑公司承建牛马司煤矿的工程，向木商石光维订购了一批木料。一九五二年石光维把木料沿河放运给该矿时，山洪暴发，冲散木材六百多根，并把群众新修的上车桥冲垮。当地群众要石光维赔修，石光维就到牛马司煤矿找杜维松，要求补助修桥费用。同年十一月间经该矿上级领导批准，补助了人民币二百万元。去年四月桥修好以后，石又向杜维松要求再补助二百万元。杜维松为了借机贪污，对石光维说：“写二百万元恐怕上级不会批准这多，你写五百万元，上级批多少算多少。”杜维松亲自在石光维要求补助的申请书上，把二百万元改成五百万元，要石光维重抄一遍，同时叫石光维写了一张五百万元的领据。以后杜维松就把石光维的申请书转报资江工矿公司审批。去年五月五日资江工矿公司批复：“可以酌情补助一部分”，杜维松就把石光维原写的领据上的四月五日改成五月五日，向财务科领出现款五百万元。不久石光维去该矿送木料，杜维松把人民币一百五十万元交给石光维说：“上级只批准这么多，以后不要再问了。”杜维松就贪污了人民币三百五十万元。去年六月十日石光维到牛马司煤矿领木料价款时，杜维松指使出纳邹定成乘机偷了石光维的私章，再亲自用石光维的私章盖了一张空白领据。去年八月间，石光维又到该矿领木料价款，写了一张一百五十万元的领据。杜维松要石光维把领据交给他，还撒谎说：“财务科现在没有人，我替你领出来，以后让申科长给你送去。”石光维走后，杜维松把这一百五十万元的领据撕毁，把先前盖有石光维的私章的空白领据用左手写上四百万元，用右手签名批准，从当中贪污了二百五十万元。去年三月杜维松去长沙开会，该矿医务所医师刘冠俊托杜维松买一批药品，当面交给现款四百万元。到长沙以后，杜维松把全部现款留作私用，把购药单交给该矿驻长沙办事处采购员禹仲初，叫他用公款照单购买，后来禹仲初共垫付价款五百六十五万多元。杜维松回矿以后，把购药发票交给医务所，医务所根据发票补交杜维松人民币一百六十五万多元，就这样全部药款五百六十五万多元被杜维松贪污了。加上其他几次贪污，杜维松先后贪污盗窃国家财产共人民币二千六百多万元，除两次用贪污款抵还贪污款计四百五十万元和贪污没有到手的七百万元以外，其余一千四百八十多万元全部被他挥霍掉了。
    去年十一月十七日，杜维松为了积极筹款搪塞贪污，就开始和供销科副科长申雨露图谋、策划盗卖焦炭。因为该矿所生产的焦炭上级决定不许外售，当时申雨露感到卖焦炭手续复杂，表示犹豫。杜就指使说：“卖焦炭可以不开发票，或者发票不转财务科；由你亲自开发票，再嘱咐几个可靠的人过磅，亲自监督。”去年十二月十七日杜维松再次催申雨露盗卖，还指使说：“如果这里无法卖出，可以去邵阳卖空盘，先取款，再逐渐交货，我暂时用价款垫付亏欠，以后设法解决，免得工业厅查出麻烦。”后来申雨露在外面找了几个私商打听，因为私商不能一次交清价款，盗卖没有成功。十二月二十五日，杜维松由邵阳市回牛马司煤矿，路过高崇山时，亲自找私商卖焦炭，当时议定出卖二十九吨，每吨价三十一万元。并约定私商在今年一月十日到该矿交钱取货。但在这时，杜维松的贪污事实已经被发现，中共邵阳地委会开始追查他的贪污事实，所以这次盗卖没有成功。
    杜维松为了便于自己贪污盗窃，曾经用各种卑鄙手段拉拢品质很坏的该矿供销科副科长申雨露。从一九五二年起杜维松就屡次擅自批准申雨露借用公款（现在申雨露还欠四百多万元），有时替他还账，因而使申雨露逐渐成了杜维松贪污盗窃国家财产的工具。贪污事实被发现以后，杜维松又威胁申雨露说：“如果事情弄大了，你也走不了，反正大家糟糕。”并嘱咐申雨露：“今后领导检查，你们只说不知道。”杜维松为了利用该矿医师刘冠俊给他证明没有贪污药款，擅自把刘冠俊的工资待遇由十六级提成十五级，批准对他家属的救济，进行利诱拉拢。尤其严重的是：今年一月三日杜维松为了向私商石光维借款，竟不顾国家粮食统销政策，亲自去邵东县粮食局替石光维购买粮食，因为当时粮食统销政策的限制，没达到目的。去年十二月以来，杜维松为了进行掩盖罪行的欺骗活动，就完全不管工作。该矿刘工程师曾经托申雨露带一封信交资江工矿公司倪经理（当时倪在长沙），要倪到湘南煤矿总局催批该矿的生产计划，因为这个计划如果不能在雨季以前批下来，该矿就不能添置排水设备，有造成春雨淹井的危险，杜维松为了继续掩盖错误、避免领导查问发觉，就不许申雨露和倪经理见面，指使申雨露仍然把原信带回。又该矿党支部和工会决定给下井工人买一批胶鞋，免得把脚浸烂，杜维松竟然不顾工人的安全，乘机窃取了全部买胶鞋的钱，一直没有给工人买回，严重违犯了党的保护劳动的政策，引起工人不满意。
    杜维松这种严重罪行的发生不是偶然的。他在邵阳县任区委书记期内，据他自己承认：贪污盗卖了区农民代表会的谷一千斤、米三百斤。“三反”运动时，杜维松已经调牛马司煤矿工作，对他在“三反”前的贪污，始终没有交代。“三反”刚结束，杜维松又有计划地进行贪污。犯罪事实被揭发以后，在证据确凿的情况下，经再三教育，杜维松才基本上承认了犯罪事实，但某些情节和个别问题，他仍然企图抵赖，更不愿意从思想上作彻底的批判和深刻的反省。
    中共湖南省委纪律检查委员会、湖南省人民政府工业厅监察室、中共邵阳地委纪律检查委员会、湖南省人民检察署邵阳专区分署和邵阳专署人民监察处等单位于今年一月组成联合调查组，进行了详细的调查，根据各项检举、坦白材料和查账的结果，证实了杜维松一贯贪污，情节十分严重，手段极其卑鄙，证明他品质恶劣，完全蜕化变质，丧失了作为一个共产党员和革命干部的条件，成为违犯国家法纪的犯罪分子。为了严肃国家法纪、纯洁党的组织，中共邵阳地委呈请湖南省委批准决定开除杜维松的党籍；邵阳专署呈请湖南省人民政府批准决定撤销杜维松一切行政职务，并送人民法院依法处理。湖南省人民法院邵阳专区分院根据中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例，判处杜维松有期徒刑三年。
