The suburban Beijing supply and marketing cooperatives have completed their agricultural product pre-purchase work, with all work completed by mid-May. A total of 4.85 million jin of rice and 2.77 million jin of cotton were pre-purchased, exceeding the original pre-purchase plan. The suburban supply and marketing cooperatives signed 1,830 contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, year-round mutual aid teams, and members' groups, with a total pre-purchase value of more than 30.5 billion yuan, and a total pre-purchase deposit of more than 1.84 billion yuan was paid.

Through pre-purchase, the state has planned to control grain and industrial raw materials, and has helped farmers solve many difficulties in production and life, stabilized farmers' production sentiment, and expanded the planting area of some cash crops. The Northeast Wang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District used the cotton pre-purchase deposit it received to buy fertilizer, which solved the problem of topdressing fertilizer. Many new members of the Huofengqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanyuan District solved the difficulties in their spring farming lives after receiving the deposit. Most of the rice farmers in Liulangzhuang in Haidian District and Huaifang Township in Nanyuan District had to sell their green seedlings in the past due to a lack of production funds, and were exploited by usury. This year, with the support of pre-purchase deposits and bank loans, the difficulties in production and life have been basically solved.

In order to cooperate with the pre-purchase work, the suburban supply and marketing cooperatives have supplied farmers with production materials and living materials in a timely manner. In the first and middle ten days of May, Nanyuan District sold various oil cakes for topdressing fertilizer, an increase of 50% over the same period in April. The East Suburban District Cooperative also appropriately increased the types of commodities at the beginning of pre-purchases in key townships.

    北京市郊区供销合作社
    超额完成农产品预购工作
    北京各郊区供销合作社的预购农产品工作，到五月中旬已经全部结束。共预购稻谷四百八十五万斤，皮棉二百七十七万斤，超额完成了原订预购计划。各郊区供销合作社共和农业生产合作社、常年互助组和社员小组签订合同一千八百三十件，预购产品总值三百零五亿多元，共支付预购定金十八亿四千多万元。
    通过预购，国家有计划地掌握了粮食和工业原料，并帮助农民解决了不少生产上和生活上的困难，稳定了农民的生产情绪，扩大了部分经济作物的种植面积。海淀区东北旺乡农业生产合作社把领到的棉花预购定金买了肥料，解决了追肥的困难。南苑区霍凤岐农业生产合作社有不少新入社的社员在领到定金后，解决了春耕中生活的困难。海淀区的六郎庄、南苑区的槐房乡的大部分稻农，往年因为缺乏生产资金，要出卖青苗，受到高利贷剥削，今年因为有了预购定金和银行贷款的扶持，生产上、生活上的困难基本上都得到解决。
    各郊区供销合作社为配合预购工作，都及时供应了农民生产资料和生活资料。南苑区在五月上、中两旬售出追肥用的各种油饼，比四月份同期的供应量增加百分之五十。东郊区社并在重点乡预购开始时适当增加了商品种类。
