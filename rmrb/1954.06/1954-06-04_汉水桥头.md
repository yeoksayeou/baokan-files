    The connecting line linking the Jinghan Railway and the Yuehan Railway is already having its roadbed built.
    Countless workers, with flexible shoulder poles on their shoulders, carry two baskets of yellow mud, running back and forth in the "line construction zone," which looks chaotic at first glance but is extremely organized upon closer inspection. Tractors chug, towing iron rollers, compacting the raised, fiery-yellow roadbed firmly.
    The roadbed stretches out like a long snake. This connecting line will cross the Han River and the Yangtze River. It branches off from the railway line in Hankou, winding its way directly to Hanyang.
    But it suddenly stops in front of the Han River. The Han River blocks it.
    When I went to the Han River Railway Bridge Engineering Section of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau, I followed this high, raised roadbed, walked to the bridge abutment, and looked down at the violently flowing Han River rushing downstream, plunging into the Yangtze River. The Han River is wide and deep. In spring and summer, it is turbid. But on that chest, which still looks sparkling, large and small ships travel busily.
    Right next to the bridge abutment, two derricks rise into the sky, becoming a visible symbol of this famous project from near and far. Red stars celebrating "May Day" shine on them.
    Citizens near Wuhan, visitors from as far as Tibet, come to the construction site every day to visit. Standing among these piles of timber, steel, pipe piles, gravel, and iron cables, behind the steam spewing from the machines, they excitedly see the engineering panorama of the "water construction zone" of the Han River Bridge, which is attracting attention and concern from people across the country.
    In this May, several bridge piers have already emerged from the water, standing majestically.
    Only in the middle of the Han River is there no bridge pier yet, but there is a huge wooden caisson, also called a wooden cofferdam. It is like a city wall, half floating on the water, half already submerged. On its left and right are two tall scaffoldings. Several mighty iron barges are docked against the wooden caisson, making this place seem like a floating island. Two crane barges stretch out a pair of steel arms towards the sky.
    Looking from the Hankou bridge abutment, the scene at the wooden caisson is magnificent and complex. It is the focus of attention for the entire construction site. In May, the Han River Bridge project reached its climax. With the completion of the bottom sealing work of the wooden caisson, the biggest difficulty in the entire project has been overcome.
    Steel beams and trusses erected on the bridge have been continuously transported from the north.
    The "riveting and pinning construction zone" is ready. Once this last pier emerges from the water, the majestic bridge will be erected. The train will pass over it, leaving the Han River behind, and travel directly to the Yangtze River ferry terminal via the fiery-yellow connecting line built on the Hanyang shore.
    People who cross bridges rarely know the bridge builders. But the Wuhan Bridge will not be like that. Its builders will be known and cheered by the people of the whole country. This is certain. When I was at the Han River Bridge, I saw some bridge builders. What heroic builders they are! …
    The country's bridge construction talents are concentrated at the head of the Han River Bridge. It seems like everyone you meet has built several bridges in their experience.
    People come from the Yellow River Iron Bridge; from the Qiantang River Bridge. People come from the Jinguang Bridge and Jiefang Bridge in Tianjin and the Haizhu Bridge in Guangzhou; from the Songhua River Bridge, the Huai River Bridge and the Xiang River Bridge; from the Eighth Bridge where the hero Yang Liandi showed his skills. And the most beloved people come from the Yalu River Bridge, the Qingchuan River Bridge and the Datong River Bridge. From border to border, from northeast to southwest, the bridge builders of the country's railways, highways and cities seem to have sent their representatives here.
    At the same time, the Han River Bridge has become a bridge school. Here, people build, learn, and prepare to conquer the Yangtze River, to build one of the largest bridges in the East and in the world – the Yangtze River Bridge. The Han River Bridge will lay the technical foundation for the Yangtze River Bridge.
    And it, the Yangtze River Bridge, will further lay a new foundation for the country's bridge cause.
    Engineer Zhao also mentioned this when he spoke to me. After he handed over the shift to Engineer Zou, we sat together on the light railway in front of the command post on the Hanyang shore, looking at the waves shimmering with golden light, and talked.
    After explaining the wooden caisson to me, Engineer Zhao said:
    "I just transferred here. I originally came to the Yangtze River Bridge to do design work. Because I don’t have enough practical experience yet, I came to the Han River Bridge to work on this big guy and learn something."
    He pointed to the wooden caisson.
    "I haven't worked with wooden caissons before," he explained, "Why did the Soviet experts decide to use wooden caissons? It's to give us the opportunity to train ourselves. If we used the cofferdam method, it would be simpler, but we wouldn't learn anything, and we wouldn't be well prepared for the Yangtze River Bridge."
    The sun is setting opposite us. Under a sunset glow, the water ripples. The water construction zone becomes very beautiful. Along the banks of the Han River, countless ships are moored, their masts and sails flying red and green festive flags, which are gently moved by the evening breeze. A two-story steamer full of passengers sailed into the two bridge piers, passing through them. You can see the passengers leaning on the railings, gesticulating and talking about the Han River Bridge. You can almost see the joy and pride on their faces.
    Dusk gradually arrives. The lights on pier number five suddenly light up, illuminating the wooden caisson floating on the water like a city tower. Workers, like geckos, climb on all sides of it, reinforcing it with axes and chisels, and embedding hemp in the seams to prevent it from leaking. At this time, Engineer Zhao recalled a person:
    "In 1935, the year I graduated from Jiaotong University, a professor named Qian organized a company to bid for the Qiantang River Bridge project. The Kuomintang didn't believe in a company run by Chinese themselves, so a Dane won the bid. In fact, the Dane was doing empty business. He didn't have many people himself, so he subcontracted part of the project to Mr. Qian. I participated in the Qiantang River Bridge project at that time."
    Engineer Zhao told me that this Mr. Qian once dreamed of building the Yangtze River Bridge, and also dreamed of gathering the country's bridge talents together to establish a national bridge organization to do something big. To this end, he ran around, but the result was naturally a failure. The few people who were barely gathered together, including Engineer Zhao, only did some work on compiling regulations and determining bridge types. In the old society, all this could only be a dream.
    "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he accepted the task of repairing the Lancang River Bridge on the Burma Road. I not only participated in the design, but also went to be the captain. It was extremely difficult at that time! In the desolate mountains and wild lands, there were no people and no materials. It was difficult to build a suspension bridge, but Japanese planes bombed it. At that time, Mr. Qian was in Chongqing. When he heard the news, he immediately flew to Kunming. Unfortunately, he encountered enemy planes near Kunming. The plane caught fire under the strafing of enemy planes. This man who had great dreams for China's bridge cause was sacrificed."
    Dusk has fallen. The water waves under the lights show the whirlpools of the rapids. Engineer Zhao paused for a while, and then continued, "I haven't thought about this person for many years. After being transferred to the Han River Bridge, I thought about him again these past two days. Everything he dreamed of can now be realized. He was a man with a career. How happy he would be if he could live to see the development of China's bridge cause!"
    After a moment of silence, Engineer Zhao let out a light laugh, "Look, where did I go! Do you still want to ask me any questions about the wooden caisson?"
    The process of using the wooden caisson method is roughly as follows:
    Build a wooden caisson upstream; float it to the position of the bridge pier; sink the wooden caisson to the bottom of the river; divers clean up the riverbed; pour concrete underwater - this is the bottom sealing of the wooden caisson; after the bottom is sealed, drain the water from the wooden caisson; then you can tie steel bars and wooden molds inside and pour concrete bridge piers. When the bridge piers rise above the water, the entire foundation project of the Han River Bridge will be completed.
    Everyone understands the importance of foundation work in basic construction: without a good foundation, there can be no solid superstructure. The important problem in building the Han River Bridge, and the real difficulty of the future Yangtze River Bridge, is to build a good bridge pier foundation in deep water.
    The main key in the process is the bottom sealing of the wooden caisson, but every link in it is not simple. Taking floating and transportation as an example, how easy is it?
    This time, the floating and transportation of the wooden caisson was organized very well. The entire construction zone moved like one person. The commander-in-chief held the flag; on the shore and on the iron barges, there were people holding the flag on every winch. All the winches moved in harmony and precision like a machine. The wooden caisson, tightened up and down, left and right by iron cables, was floated down as the winch slowly released the iron cables. But suddenly it tilted.
    It is not easy to pull out a truck whose wheels have sunk into the ditch beside the road. How nervous it is to see the tilting wooden caisson!
    However, the Soviet expert remained exceptionally calm. He stood there gazing, staring intently.
    The method the expert came up with was so simple, just moving the wooden caisson 16 meters to the right bank, using the slope of the riverbed to balance it, and then pulling it to the position of the bridge pier at once.
    Everyone who talked about this was full of admiration. On the construction site, people said: Comrade Oniskov was a veteran Red Army soldier during the October Revolution. After the revolution, the Party's training made him a top technical talent in Soviet bridge engineering and a leading comrade of the Soviet Bridge Bureau. People talked happily and enviously, "It's really admirable to see these old Bolsheviks!" "They are people who take down any fortress they attack!" "With such people helping us and guiding us in the bridge school of the Han River Bridge!" …
    The young girl Xiao Cheng was assigned to the rigging class for an internship. The squad leader was Lao Bi, who had repaired the Yellow River Iron Bridge. He started working at the age of seventeen, and in twenty-eight years he had repaired countless bridges on various roads in the Northeast, the Jiaoji Road, the Shide Road, and the Shitai Road. After liberation, he repaired the sluice gates of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the Xiang River Bridge.
    Among all these qualified bridge talents, Xiao Cheng was naturally much worse. She hadn't built a bridge in her experience. She only graduated from Tongji University at the end of 1953. Because she studied bridge engineering, she was sent to the head of the Han River Bridge in early March.
    Isn't this a great happiness? She was excited. She believed that she would meet strict leaders like Batmanov in "Far from Moscow" and such political commissars, engineers, workers and Communist Youth League members; and, she thought, she would rely closely on the workers, learn from the worker brothers, etc.; on the first day she came to the head of the Han River Bridge, she wanted to know everything completely.
    When this tall girl saw the workers climbing the steep scaffolding rapidly, overlooking the abyss, but walking back and forth in big strides, when she saw a worker jumping onto the cable wind in the high sky, working almost desperately, she thought: These people are integrated with the Han River Bridge. Suddenly she heard someone shouting: "Who has a ruler? Who brought a ruler?" It happened that she had a steel ruler with her, so she hurriedly handed it over, and forgot that she was on the water. Of course, she fell into the water, fell into the wooden cage. But Lao Bi just turned around and grabbed her. This rigging squad leader was burly, energetic, but he was also rude and glared when he spoke. At first, she couldn't see that he was also a clever, meticulous, and careful person. There would be no accidents working with him.
    Rigging workers, that is, crane operators, called scaffolding workers in the Northeast, are a very simple profession. In the past, without mechanized equipment, it required extreme wit to lift heavy steel equipment back and forth. Now, the rigging workers of the Han River Bridge have highly mechanized equipment, but they still need a high degree of wit.
    Before the wooden caisson is floated to the bridge pier, it must be tied to the scaffolding on both sides with iron cables. When Lao Bi's rigging squad was passing iron cables through the middle of the scaffolding to tie it, Xiao Cheng suddenly screamed, "Stop! Stop! This tie is wrong!"
    The workers were working intensely. Her order was like pouring cold water on them. She wanted their iron cables to be tied from the outside of the scaffolding instead of from the middle. Lao Bi glared. But the girl wouldn't give in. The work stopped. She said, "We have to ask the engineer!"
    So she hurried to find the engineer.
    She didn't expect that the engineer said that the workers were doing the right thing. Rigging workers have to work flexibly according to the specific situation at the time. She didn't expect that Lao Bi gave her a criticism at the squad meeting. She was ashamed and embarrassed.
    "Xiao Cheng just doesn't believe us... She asks the engineer again and again. She keeps the engineer too busy... Her feet have just left the school gate!"
    The next day, the workers shouted slogans in the heavy rain, working with full enthusiasm. Just as they were putting the *iron pipe into the water, Xiao Cheng ran over in a hurry with red oil. She thought that she had to draw lines on the *iron pipe to measure the depth before putting it into the water.
    "Stop! Stop!" She almost shouted, "Pull the *iron pipe out of the water." The words were already in her throat, but fortunately, she suppressed herself today. She had just been warned yesterday. She thought that she shouldn't let the workers stop. As for drawing lines with red oil, she had to think of another way. Another way was quickly thought of. Can you not become more witty when working with rigging workers?
    The young intern is growing rapidly. "Everyone cares about me. Lao Bi is strict when criticizing." Xiao Cheng smiled, revealing her snow-white teeth: "But he also takes care of me carefully, helping me to walk. I feel happy working and studying here! And now, in my experience, I already have a bridge. Do you know how many bridges I can have in the future!" …
    The foreman, Lao Gao, is sometimes called "Gao Huizi" because he has a small mustache. He wears a railway bureau uniform, and his hat has a railway bureau round cap flower. There are deep wrinkles on both sides of his eyes. Looking at his ochre black face, you know that he is a highly skilled and hard-working person.
    He always has a light smile on his face. Even when the project is so tense that others' faces are strained, he is still calm and almost dashing. Sometimes, he shrugs his shoulders and spins around, because someone is calling him here and someone is calling him there. On the construction site, from workers to engineers, everyone looks for Lao Gao, because he has a way.
    At that time, when the Han River Bridge had just started construction, and people who were transferred from all directions didn't know each other yet, Lao Gao quickly mastered the technology of using universal pile drivers and water jet pile driving to drive pipe piles. As he spread his experience, his reputation spread.
    Lao Gao is the same age as this century. In his thirty-six years of work, he has repaired bridges on the Yuehan Road, Xianggui Road and Laimu Road, skyscrapers, sluices, docks and lighthouses. When the reactionaries clamored to build the Yangtze River Bridge in 1931, he came to the Yangtze River twice and drilled four holes, so he knew a lot of information about the Yangtze River Bridge and the plans that were made at that time.
    From the fact that he went to North Korea at the age of fifty-two to repair bridges, you can know that he has an incredibly passionate personality. He dedicated his third child, a brave child, to this war to defend peace, who was sacrificed on the Korean battlefield. He attended his child's memorial service.
    When the news of building the Yangtze River Bridge reached Lao Gao's ears, how that passion burned in him! When his request was approved, how that joy excited him! When he arrived at the construction site, what kind of energy was driving him to work! He immediately rented a house near the construction site. Others moved into the dormitory. Only he moved his whole family over, wholeheartedly wanting to build this great bridge, this socialist great project.
    Talking to Lao Gao, you feel a strong confidence.
    "The wooden caisson is not easy to make, right?" I said.
    He kept waving his head, smiling and saying, "Nothing! I've made wooden caissons before. Of course, not as big as this one. The big one is easier to make than the small one. The small one has iron cables everywhere, and if you trip, you'll fall!"
    He laughed heartily.
    "What about the Yangtze River Bridge?" I asked: "The Yangtze River water is big! These two days, there have been white waves..."
    "What is this? I've done it in the sea too. We repaired seven lighthouses in Dagu Port, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qingdao. The sea is very interesting, and there are yellow water, red water, green water, and black water - that is, river water, flood water, sea water, and ocean water."
    I went to Lao Gao's house. It was a small wooden house, only twenty or thirty steps away from the construction site gate. When he comes back from work, he has to drink four ounces of wine. His wife brought a bowl of mandarin fish, and poured two bowls of Fenjiu wine.
    "You speak so interestingly, but, Lao Gao, everyone is very concerned about the Yangtze River Bridge."
    His eyes sparkled happily, and his small mustache trembled. Yes, he knows that everyone is concerned, they sent so many letters of condolence, and so many people came to visit. But he said something that stunned me:
    "I don't care about what everyone cares about. If everyone cares about 'Can the bridge be built?' 'Is it very difficult!' If it's these, I don't care about these, not at all. We have confidence. We don't care about these, we care about other things."
    He told me "other things." In order to learn the craft, he didn't know how many nights he spent studying and thinking when he was young. Now it has become a habit, and he can only sleep for three or four hours every night, and he wakes up in the middle of the night. When he wakes up, he has to think, and think until dawn. Not just thinking blindly! But thinking about work, arranging everything for the next day, carefully considering every detail: who is strong in what? Who is weak, and who to find for help? As soon as it dawns, he first walks around the construction site, keeping the materials and tools in his eyes, so that whenever he needs anything, he always knows where to find it. "Can you do a good job without using your heart?" he said.
    When talking about the bottom sealing of the wooden caisson, he was beaming with joy.
    "When pier number four was bottom-sealed, there was a big wind and rain, and even snow was mixed in the rain. We fought hard in the wind and rain for a day and a night. Many funnels were clogged, and the concrete couldn't leak down. Some failed five times, but finally they were completely successful. I was in charge of one funnel that time. We started at four-thirty in the afternoon, and I completed the task by ten o'clock. If Director Peng hadn't ordered me to go back, I would have continued. I went there early the next morning, and there were still a few funnels that hadn't been completed. I helped one. Wow wow wow wow! It only took more than an hour to complete the task. It was so enjoyable."
    On the morning of the bottom sealing of the wooden caisson, the construction site was as tense as a battlefield. The already sunk wooden caisson only revealed a neck, and the iron barges surrounding it expanded the area of the floating island. Huge sleepers built high platforms, and many concrete mixers were placed on them. Along the high platforms were corridors and springboards. The outer iron barges and wooden boats were filled with cement bags, sand, and gravel. All personnel were in place, ready to go.
    At this time, dark clouds gathered, and the old friends of the Han River Bridge, big wind and rain, came to join the fun again. Eight hundred people put on green, black and blue raincoats and brown rain capes. The floating island became more and more tense. Every position was guarded; people were walking quickly in the corridors and on the springboards. Commanders appeared. The mixers started to turn, testing the vehicles. Photographers climbed to the high observation platform on the crane barge, and their lens boxes faced down, taking panoramic shots.
    Inside the wooden caisson, all the funnels had been installed, and long pipes extended from under the funnels all the way to the bottom of the water. At eleven o'clock in the morning on May 5th, the bottom sealing began. Huge sound waves crashed on the Han River, merging with the sound of wind and rain. Concrete flowed continuously from the mixer, pouring into the bottom of the water. In the midst of the intense work, I saw Lao Gao's face. Naturally, even at this time he was smiling, but he disappeared in a flash. I also saw Lao Bi and Xiao Cheng, but the concrete workers running over from the springboard covered them up again. I saw everyone I knew, but I couldn't see them again in a flash. I only saw eight hundred people working together and fighting together here. In the middle of this, time passed quickly. The Han River surged with rapid waves, as if struggling.
    Ten hours seemed like just a moment. The rain stopped, the night came, the sound waves were lighter, and the mixers stopped turning one by one. All the ships full of gravel were empty. The bottom sealing of the wooden caisson had been completed smoothly and quickly!
    When I finally saw Lao Gao, he was waving his hands and talking, his voice full of excitement and emotion: "Today's work was enjoyable, today's work was much more enjoyable than pier number four!"
    I once took the No. 1 ship of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau from the construction site. The driver held the large wheel and turned it. A sailor held a large red flag and waved it at the bow, directing the small boats on the water.
    Many ships are moored on both sides of the Han River. The masts are like a forest. It is really the scene of "ships like clouds" that the ancients said. The houses on both sides of the river are closely arranged. The steamer passed Wusheng Street, where another highway bridge across the Han River will soon be built; the steamer also approached Jijiazu, where another traffic bridge across the Han River in the Wuhan urban area will soon be built. The steamer made a turn and arrived at the confluence of the Han River and the Yangtze River.
    Here, you can fully feel the majestic situation of the three towns of Wuhan. A city of machine industry is being built. The steamer vibrated. The closer you get to the Yangtze River, the more you feel the power of this great river. A white wave surged, spreading boundlessly to the west. The steamer roared and headed upstream. Facing a flood, it seemed like a waterfall pouring down from the sky. Great river, treasure of the motherland! Strong mother! Yangtze River!
    It is on this flood that the magnificent Yangtze River Bridge will rise. The eyes of the people of the whole country will be transferred to the new task of these confident builders …

    汉水桥头
    徐迟
    使京汉铁路和粤汉铁路连接起来的联络线路已经在筑着路基了。
    数不清楚的工人们，在肩膀上担着富有弹性的扁担，挑起两筐黄泥，来回奔跑在初看时一片混乱、细看去极有组织的排着队形的“线路工区”里。拖拉机喀喀地叫着，曳引着铁滚筒，把垫高起来的火黄色的路基压得结结实实。
    路基像长蛇一样的伸长。这道联络线路要跨过汉水，跨过长江。它从汉口的铁路线上分出一支，蜿蜒而来，直奔汉阳。
    可是它突然停在汉水面前。汉水阻住了它。
    我到武汉大桥工程局的汉水铁桥工程段去的时候，就沿着这高高隆起的路基，走向桥台，俯视这性格暴烈的汉水急湍地奔向下游，投入长江。汉水宽阔而深邃。春夏季里是混浊的。但在那望去依然亮晶晶的胸膛上，大小船舶繁忙地行驶着。
    就在桥台旁边，有两座扒杆冲天而起，成为这著名工程的远近都能看见的标志。庆祝“五一”节的红星就在上面闪耀。
    近在武汉的市民，远自西藏来的访问者，每天都络绎不绝地来到工地参观。他们站在这些木料、钢料、管桩、碎石堆、铁索中间，在机器间喷出的蒸汽后面，兴奋地看到了为全国人民所瞩目和关怀的汉水桥“水上工区”的工程图景。
    在这个五月里，有几个桥墩已经抢出水面，巍然峙立着了。
    只有在汉水的中流，还没有桥墩，却有一座巨大的木沉井，也叫木沉箱。它像一座城垣，一半浮在水上，一半已经下沉。在它的左右有两付高大的脚手排架。几艘威武的铁驳靠着木沉井停泊着，使这里好像成了一个浮岛。两艘起重吊船向天空伸出一对钢铁的胳膊。
    从汉口桥台望去，木沉井那里的场景，雄伟而复杂。它是整个工地上人们注意力的集中点。在五月里，汉水桥的工程到达了它的最高潮。完成了木沉井的封底工作，整个工程中最大的困难已经战胜了。
    架在桥上的钢梁和花梁已经从北方源源运来，
  “拼铆工区”已经作好准备。等到这最后一个墩出了水面，雄壮的桥梁便将架成了。火车将要通过它，把汉水甩在后面，通过已在汉阳岸上筑起的火黄色的联络线路，直奔长江渡口。
    从来过桥人不知道修桥人。但是，武汉大桥将不是这样。它的建设者将为全国人民所熟识和欢呼。这是一定的。当我在汉水桥的时候，我看到了一些修桥人。他们是多么豪迈的建设家！……
    全国的桥梁建设人才都集中到了汉水桥头。好像你遇到的每个人的经历中，都曾经修过几座桥似的。
    人们来自黄河大铁桥；来自钱塘江大桥。人们来自天津的金钢桥、解放桥和广州的海珠桥；来自松花江桥，淮河桥和湘江大桥；来自登高英雄杨连第显身手的八号桥。还有最可爱的人，来自鸭绿江桥、清川江桥和大同江桥。从边疆，到边疆，从东北，到西南，全国的铁路、公路和城市里的桥梁建筑者们，好像都派出自己的代表，来到这里了。
    同时，汉水桥成为一座桥梁学校。在这里，人们建设着，学习着，准备着征服长江，造东方的也是世界的最大桥梁之一——长江大桥。汉水桥将为长江大桥打下技术基础。
    而它，长江大桥，更将为祖国的桥梁事业奠定新的基础。
    赵工程师在给我谈话时，也谈到了这一点。在他交班给邹工程师之后，我们一起坐在汉阳岸，指挥所前面的轻便铁道上，望着闪闪发出金色光芒的波浪，谈着话。
    给我解释过木沉井之后，赵工程师说：
    “我是刚刚调来的。到长江大桥来，本来是做设计工作的。因为实际经验还不大够，所以到汉水桥，搞一下这个大家伙，也学习一番。”
    他举手指一指木沉井。
   “以前不曾搞过木沉井，”他解释说：“为什么苏联专家决定用木沉井呢？就是为了让我们有机会训练自己。如果做围堰法，事体是简单点，可就学不到东西，为长江大桥做准备也就做不好了。”
    夕阳正在我们对面下沉。一片晚霞下，水波粼粼。水上工区变得非常的美丽。沿着汉水两岸，停泊着无数船舶，桅杆和帆索上飘着红色绿色的节日的旗帜，晚风使它们柔和地拂动。满载乘客的两层汽轮驶进了两座桥墩，从中通过，可以看见乘客们扑在栏杆上指手划脚地谈论着汉水桥，几乎可以看见他们脸上的欣喜和骄傲的表情。
    黄昏渐渐到来。五号墩上的灯火突然亮了，照明了城楼一样的浮在水面的木沉井。工人们壁虎似的爬在它的四面，用斧凿加固它，在嵌缝里嵌进使它不致于漏水的麻。这时，赵工程师回忆起一个人来：
   “一九三五年，我在交通大学毕业的那年，一个姓钱的教授组织了个公司，投标钱塘江桥的工程。国民党不相信中国人自己办的公司，结果给一个丹麦人得了标。其实，丹麦人是做空头生意的，自己没有多少人手，还是把一部分工程包给钱先生做。我就是那时参加了钱塘江桥工程的。”
    赵工程师告诉我，这个钱先生曾经梦想过修建长江大桥，也曾经梦想过要把全国的桥梁人才集中起来，成立全国性的桥梁机构，做一番事业。为此他四出奔走，结果自然失败了。勉强集中起来的少数几个人，赵工程师也在内，只做了一些编规程和定桥型的工作。在旧社会里，这一切只能是梦想而已。
   “抗战时，他接受了修滇缅路的澜沧江桥任务。我不但参加设计，还去当了队长。当时可是苦透苦透！荒山野地里，要人没人，要材料没材料。好容易把一座悬索桥修起，日本飞机把它炸坏了。那时钱先生在重庆，闻讯马上飞昆明。不幸在昆明附近遭遇敌机，座机在敌机扫射下起了火。这个对中国桥梁事业抱有远大梦想的人就这样牺牲了。”
    暮色已经四合。灯光下的水波显出急湍的回纹。赵工程师停了一会，又接下去说，“我好多年没有想到这个人了。调来汉水桥以后，这两天我又想到了他。凡是他梦想过的，现在都可以实现了。他是个有事业心的人，如果能活着看见中国桥梁事业的发达，他是多么高兴啊！”
    又静了一会儿，赵工程师发出了轻轻的笑声，“你看，我讲到什么地方去了！你还要问我什么关于木沉井的问题吗？”
    使用木沉井法的过程大致是这样的：
    在上游筑一座木沉井；把它浮运到桥墩的位置上；把木沉井下沉到河底；潜水员整理河床；在水底下浇灌混凝土——这就是木沉井封底；封底后，把木沉井里的水抽干；就可以在里面扎钢筋木模，浇灌桥墩。等到桥墩高出水面，汉水桥的全部基础工程就完成了。
    在基本建设中，基础工程的重要性谁都明白：没有良好的基础就不能有巩固的上层建筑。修建汉水桥的重要问题，以及将来长江大桥的真正困难，就是打好深水下的桥墩基础。
    过程中的主要关键在于木沉井封底，但其中的每一个环节都不简单。拿浮运来说，也谈何容易。
    这一次，木沉井的浮运组织得可好。整个工区动作得如同一个人。总指挥拿着旗；在岸上和铁驳上，每一部铁索绞车上都有人拿着旗。所有的绞车动作得如同一部机器似的合拍和精确。上下左右被铁索拉紧的木沉井，在绞车慢慢放松铁索时浮运了下来。但忽然它倾斜了。
    一辆卡车轮子陷进了公路边的沟里，也不容易拔出来，倾斜的木沉井多么叫人紧张！
    苏联专家却依然异常镇静。他站在那里凝望着，定睛凝望着。
    专家想出来的办法竟是这样简单，仅仅是把木沉井向右岸移十六公尺，利用河床的倾斜面把它平衡后，一下子拉到了桥墩位置上。
    所有的人谈到这里都钦佩不置。在工地上，人们这样传说着：奥尼斯可夫同志是十月革命时的老红军。革命后，党的培养使他成了苏联桥梁工程的头等技术人才、苏联的桥梁局的领导同志。人们高兴地、羡慕地谈论着：“看这些老布尔什维克真叫人佩服！”“他们是攻什么堡垒就拿下什么堡垒来的人！”“在汉水桥的桥梁学校里有这样的人帮助着我们，指点着我们！”……
    年轻的姑娘小成被派在装吊班里实习。班长是老毕，修过黄河大铁桥。他十七岁开始做工，在二十八年里修过东北各路、胶济路、石德路和石太路的无数桥梁。解放后，修过荆江分洪的闸门和湘江大桥。
    在所有这些有资格的桥梁人才中间，小成自然要差得多，她的经历里一座桥也还没有。一九五三年底她才从同济大学毕业出来。因为是学桥梁的，所以三月初被送到汉水桥头。
    这可不是极大的幸福吗？她兴奋。她相信她将要遇到像“远离莫斯科的地方”里的巴特曼诺夫那样严厉的领导和那样的政委、工程师、工人和青年团员；并且，她直想着，她要紧紧依靠工人，向工人兄弟学习等等；来到汉水桥头的第一天，她就希望把一切事情都全部知道。
    当这个颀长的姑娘看到工人们急速攀登陡削的排架，下临深渊，却大踏步走来走去，当她看到一个工人踪身跃上高空中的缆风，工作起来简直奋不顾身，她想：这些人是和汉水桥融成了一片的。忽然她听见有人在喊：“谁有尺？谁带了尺？”恰好她身上带有一个钢尺，赶忙递送过去，竟忘了自己在水上，当然，她跌下了水，跌进木笼中去了。但老毕只一转身就把她拉住。这个装吊班长身材魁梧，干劲儿大，就是脾气粗暴，一说话就瞪眼。最初她看不出他同时也是个灵巧细致，缜密用心的人。和他一起工作是出不了事故的。
    装吊工即起重工，东北称架工，是很不简单的工种，过去，在没有机械化设备的情况下要把笨重的钢铁器材吊来吊去，需要非常的机智。现在汉水桥的装吊工有了高度机械化的设备，可是仍然需要高度的机智。
    木沉井浮运到桥墩前，要用铁索把它拴绑在两侧的排架上。老毕的一班装吊工正用铁索从排架中间穿过去绑扎的时候，小成突然尖叫起来，“停下！停！这样绑不对！”
    工人们正干在火头上。她的命令像浇了一瓢凉水。她要他们的铁索不从排架中间而从外面绑扎。老毕瞪了眼。姑娘可也不让步。工作停下了。她说：“要问过工程师！”
    于是她急急忙忙找工程师去了。
    她没有想到，工程师却说工人做得对。装吊工就得按当时具体情况灵活地工作。她更没有想到，在班会上，老毕给了她一顿批评。弄得她又愧又羞。
   “小成就是不信我们……要一次次问工程师。把工程师忙死了……脚还刚出校门呢！”
    第二天，工人们在大雨下喊着号子，情绪饱满地工作。正在他们把?铁放下水去的时候，小成拿着红油，急急忙忙跑来。她想，先要在?铁上划好测量深度的线，才能放下水去。
      “停下！停！”她几乎要叫喊，“把?铁从水里拉起来。”话已经到了喉头，还好，她今天抑住了自己。才昨天受的警告呢。她想，她不应该让工人们停下来。至于红油划线，她必须另想办法。另外的办法很快想了出来，跟装吊工在一起工作还能不变得机智些吗？
    年轻的实习生在迅速地成长。“谁都关心我。老毕批评起来是严厉的。”小成露出雪白的牙齿笑一笑：“但是他又小心翼翼地照顾我，扶着我走路。在这里工作和学习我感到幸福！而且，现在，在我的经历里，已经有了一座桥。你知道将来我能有多少座桥啊！”……
    领工员高老头，因为蓄着小胡子，有时人们喊他“高胡子”。他披着路局制服，帽子上有路局的圆帽花。他的眼睛两旁有着深刻的皱纹。一看他的赭黑的脸就知道他是个手艺高强，一生劳动过来的人物。
    他永远轻快地含着笑容。在工程紧张到别人绷了脸的时候，他还是神情泰然，简直是潇洒的模样。有时，他耸一耸肩，打个旋，因为这边有人叫他，那边有人唤他。工地上，从工人到工程师都找高老头，因为他有办法。
    那时汉水桥刚开工，从四面八方调来的人谁还不认识谁，高老头迅速地掌握了用万能打桩机和射水沉桩法打管桩的技术，随着他传播他的经验，就传播开了他的名声。
    高老头和这个世纪同年岁。他的三十六年工龄里修过粤汉路、湘桂路和来睦路上的桥梁，摩天楼、水闸、船坞和灯塔。一九三一年反动派嚷着要修长江大桥的时候，他就两次来到长江上，钻过四回眼，因此他知道有关长江大桥的许多资料和当时定下来的计划等等。
    从他五十二岁年纪还到朝鲜去抢修桥梁这件事看来，就可以知道他有着无比热情的性格，他在这保卫和平的战争中献出了他的第三个孩子，英勇的孩子，牺牲在朝鲜战场上。他参加了孩子的追悼会。
    当建筑长江大桥的消息传到了高老头耳朵里的时候，那股子热情是怎样地燃烧了他啊！当他的请求被批准时，那一阵欢乐是如何地激动了他啊！到了工地，更是什么样精力在推动他工作啊！他立刻在工地近旁租好房子。别人住入宿舍。独有他却全家搬过来了，一心一意就要修这座伟大的桥梁，这个社会主义的大工程。
    和高老头说话，你感到的是坚强的信心。
      “木沉井这玩意儿不好搞吧？”我说。
    他连连摇幌着头，笑眯眯说：“没有什么！我以前也做过木沉井。自然没有这一个大。这大的还比小的好做。小的，到处铁索，一绊就绊你个筋斗！”
    他哈哈笑了。
     “长江大桥呢？”我问：“长江水大啊！这两天白浪滔滔……”
      “这算什么？海里我还做过呢，大沽口、烟台、威海卫、青岛，我们修了七座灯塔。海里面有趣得很呢，有黄水、红水、绿水和黑水之分——就是河水、洪水、海水和洋水之分。”
    我到了高老头家里。一座小木屋，离工地大门只二三十步路。放工回来，他要喝四两酒。他爱人端来了一碗桂鱼，又斟出两碗汾酒。
      “你说得那末有意思，可是，高老头，大家非常关心长江大桥呢。”
    他的眼睛欢乐地闪亮，小胡子也颤动起来。是的，大家的关心，他是知道的，捎来了那末多慰问信，跑来那末多参观的人。可是他说了句话，使我
  一愣：
      “大家关心的我不关心。倘若大家关心的是 ‘大桥建不建得成？’‘困难得很吧！’倘若是这些，这些我不关心，一点也不关心。我们有信心。我们不关心这些，关心别些。”
    他把“别些”告诉了我。为了学手艺，年轻的时候他不知熬了多少个夜晚，钻研着，想着。现在成了习惯，每夜只能睡三四个小时，睡到半夜就醒来。醒来了，就要想，一直想到天亮。不是瞎想！而是想工作，安排第二天的一切，仔细考虑到每一个细节：谁的能力强在哪儿？谁的能力差，找谁帮助？天一亮起来，先在工地上走一圈，把材料工具看在眼里，以便什么时候要什么，他总知道什么地方有什么。“不用心，还能做得好工作吗？”他说。
    谈到木沉井封底，他就眉飞色舞了。
     “四号墩封底的时候，正好大风大雨，雨里还夹雪珠。我们在风雨中苦斗了一昼夜。许多漏斗塞死了，混凝土漏不下去，有失败了五次的，但是最后还是完全成功了。那一次我掌握一个漏斗。我们是下午四时半开始的，到十点我就完成任务了。要不是彭局长命令我回去，我还要干下去呢。第二天清早去了，还有几个漏斗没有完成。我帮助一个。哗哗哗哗！只有一个多点钟就完成了任务，干得可痛快。”
    木沉井封底的那个早晨，工地上紧张得像在战场上。已经下沉的木沉井只露出一个颈部，围绕着它的铁驳，使浮岛的面积又扩大了。巨大的枕木垒起了高台，放上去好多盘混凝土搅拌机。沿着高台是走廊和跳板。外围的铁驳和木船上装满水泥袋、砂子和碎石。所有的人员已各就各位，摆好了阵势。
    这时，乌云四集，汉水桥头的老朋友大风大雨又来赶热闹了。八百人穿上了绿色、黑色和蓝色的雨衣和棕色的蓑衣。浮岛上愈来愈紧张了。每一个岗位上有人把守着；走廊上，跳板上有人疾行着。指挥人员出现。搅拌机转动起来，试着车。摄影记者爬到了吊船上面高高的了望台，他们的镜箱朝着下面，拍摄全景。
    在木沉井内，所有的漏斗都已经装好，长长的导管从漏斗下一直伸到水底。五月五日上午十一时，封底开始。巨大的声浪在汉水上撞响，和风雨声溶成一片。混凝土从搅拌机里川流不息地倒出来，倒到水底去。在紧张的工作中间我看见了高老头的脸。自然，即使在这时他还是含着笑容的，一晃却又不见了他。我也看见了老毕和小成，但混凝土工从跳板上奔跑过来，又遮去了他们。我认识的人都看见了，一下又看不见了。只见八百人在这里共同劳动，共同战斗。这中间，时间很快的过去。汉水涌起急浪，似乎是在挣扎着。
    十来个小时好像只是一瞬。雨止了，夜来了，声浪轻了，搅拌机一盘盘停了下来。满载砂石的船舶只只都空了。木沉井封底已经顺利地迅速地完成！
    当最后我看见高老头的时候，他扬着手说话，声音里充满了兴奋感情：“今天干得痛快，今天干得比四号墩还痛快得多哪！”
    我曾乘坐着武汉大桥工程局的壹号轮从工地下驶。驾驶员掌着大盘，转动它。一个水手举着大红旗，在船头挥动，指挥水面的小船只。
    汉水两岸，停泊着许多船舶，桅杆和森林一样，真是古人所谓船舻如云的景象。两岸屋宇，鳞次栉比。汽轮驶过武圣街，这里快要建立另一座跨汉水的公路桥；汽轮又驶近集稼咀，这里也快要建立另一座武汉市区内的跨汉水的交通桥。汽轮拐了个弯，就到了汉水与长江汇流处。
    在这里，你充分可以感到武汉三镇的雄壮的形势。一座机器工业之城正在兴建起来。汽轮震动了，愈驶近长江时，你愈感到这道大江的威力，一片白浪汹涌澎湃，浩瀚无际地向西头伸展。汽轮吼叫一声，向上游方向顶去。迎面一片洪流，好像是天上泻下来的瀑布。伟大的河流，祖国的宝！强壮的母亲！长江！
    正是在这洪流之上将升起宏丽的长江大桥来。全国人民的视线将要转移到这个信心百倍的建设家们的新任务上来了……
