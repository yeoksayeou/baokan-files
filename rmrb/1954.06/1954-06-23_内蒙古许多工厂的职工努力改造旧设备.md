Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 22nd: Influenced by the technological innovations of Anshan Iron and Steel, workers in many factories in Inner Mongolia are striving to renovate old equipment and improve labor productivity.

    The electric knitting machine, electric wool dyeing machine, and electric twisting machine converted from waste materials created by the workers of the Hohhot Woolen Mill have recently been put into production. From now on, manual operations in the main processes have been completely replaced by machines. The workers have revised the original plan, and the new production plan has been increased by 83.3% compared to the original plan, the output value has been increased by 76.5%, and the cost will be reduced by 8.37%. Qu Yifei, a worker at the Hua Bei Sugar Factory construction site lumber mill near Baotou, successfully created a new type of "running car measuring scale," which can enlarge various specifications of fine and dense scales. At the same time, it can automatically convert the wooden scales and Chinese feet of the old-fashioned measuring scale into meters. With this new type of measuring scale, it is very accurate and rapid to manufacture various specifications of wood. This is a major technological innovation in the lumber industry, which has a great effect on improving output, quality, and ensuring the health of workers. Cao Fengjiu, a worker at the Inner Mongolia Leather Factory, proposed a suggestion to improve technical operations. After this suggestion was adopted, the original backward ash soaking process caught up with the machine production level of other processes. Therefore, this factory can increase production by more than 10 billion yuan from April to December. Li Baorong, a mechanic at the Baotou Machinery Factory, with the strong support of the factory leadership, successfully improved the "screw tapping tool," increasing production efficiency by five times, and the product quality is very good. The factory contracted to produce 37.5 tons of screws for a construction unit. It was originally estimated that it would take 494 days to complete, but with the improved tool, it can be completed in 82 days. Workers in the repair team of the Tongliao Power Plant used waste materials to make an "automatic winch." Wu Yingui, the director of the repair workshop of the Hohhot Flour Mill, with the help of workers, successfully modified two sand picking machines. These creations have played a significant role in balancing production, reducing the labor intensity of workers, and ensuring the balanced completion of the production plan.

    内蒙古许多工厂的职工努力改造旧设备
    【新华社呼和浩特二十二日电】内蒙古地区许多工厂的职工在鞍钢技术革新的影响下，努力改造旧设备、提高劳动生产率。
    呼和浩特市毛织厂职工们创造的电动织毛衣机、电动染毛机和利用废料改装的电动合股机，最近已投入生产了。从此以后，主要工序的手工操作已完全为机器代替。职工们已修订了原来的计划，新的产量计划比原计划提高百分之八十三点三，产值提高百分之七十六点五，成本将降低百分之八点三七。包头附近华北糖厂工地制材厂工人曲一飞，创造成功了新型的“跑车摇尺”，它能把各种规格的细密尺码放大，同时，还可以把旧式摇尺的木尺和市尺自动换算成公尺。跑车有了这种新型的摇尺后，制造各种规格的木材就非常准确、迅速。这是制材工业上的一项重大技术革新，它对提高产量、质量和保证工人健康上都有很大作用。内蒙古制革厂工人曹风久提出了一项改进技术操作的建议，这项建议采用后，已使原来落后的浸灰工序赶上了其他工序的机器生产水平，因此可以使这个厂四月到十二月份增产一百多亿元。包头机械厂机工李宝荣，在厂的领导方面大力支持下，改进“套螺丝工具”成功，生产效率提高了五倍，而且产品质量很好。这个厂承揽某建筑单位的三十七吨半螺丝，原来估计要四百九十四天才能完成，用改进以后的工具，八十二天就可以完成了。通辽发电厂修理班的工人利用废料做成“自动卷扬机”，呼和浩特面粉厂修配车间主任武银贵在工人帮助下改装成功两部拣砂机，这些创造在均衡生产、减轻工人劳动强度和保证均衡完成生产计划方面都起了很大作用。
