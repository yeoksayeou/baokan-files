    Zhejiang Province will expand and rebuild more than 150 local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines this year, and construction is now underway.

    The expansion and reconstruction of these factories and mines are being carried out in accordance with the principles of "small investment, large returns, and quick utilization." These include more than ten types of industries, such as thermal power generation, machinery, fluorite, cement, bricks and tiles, papermaking, pharmaceuticals, and silk. The expansion and reconstruction of these industrial units will not only better guarantee the completion of this year's production plans, but also play a huge role in fully exploiting the potential of existing local industrial equipment. For example, the expansion and reconstruction of nine power plants can solve the problem of insufficient power supply for the current and future periods. The Hangzhou Power Plant can increase its power generation by more than 7 million kilowatt-hours per year by adding only one boiler, which can supply two 20,000-spindle spinning mills. After the expansion of the Wenzhou Power Plant, the problem of daytime electricity consumption in various factories can be solved. After a slight expansion, the Jinhua Power Plant will increase its hydropower capacity by one-half compared to the original, and can draw some of the electricity to supply agricultural irrigation. After four iron factories expand and balance their equipment, they will produce more and better machinery for agricultural and fishery production. The original calcium carbide production equipment of the joint state-private Datong Electrochemical Plant has been abandoned since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Now, with a small amount of investment and expansion, it can resume production on July 1st of this year. In order to supply the national steelmaking needs, Zhejiang Fluorite Mine will focus on surveying new mineral sources for expansion this year.

    The expansion and reconstruction projects include cement, oil-faced tiles, and brick and tile factories to meet the needs of basic construction. After a small-investment expansion of the Hangzhou Cement Plant, the annual output of mixed cement can be increased by more than two times. After the expansion of the Zhejiang Xishan Pottery Factory this year, semi-mechanized production will be carried out, and the output and quality of oil-faced tiles used for decorating buildings will be greatly improved, and the cost will also be reduced. The Jiashan Brick and Tile Factory, which supplies a large amount of bricks and tiles needed by Shanghai and Zhejiang Province, will also be expanded this year to use mechanical clay refining.

    The expanded and reconstructed machine-made paper, pharmaceutical, cotton cloth dyeing and weaving, silk, oil extraction, and tanning factories will soon create a large amount of wealth for the country. For example, the Huafeng Paper Mill, which has a large output of cigarette paper, can reduce the waste of one month of shutdown each year by simply adding a boiler workshop. After the Zhejiang Pharmaceutical Factory invests 1.4 billion yuan in expansion, it will use mechanical impregnation to manufacture the valuable drug caffeine, which can accumulate an additional 2 billion yuan in funds for the country each year.

### 浙江省今年将扩建改建一百五十多个厂矿

    浙江省今年将扩建改建一百五十多个厂矿
    浙江省今年有一百五十多个地方国营和公私合营厂矿进行扩建和改建，现在正陆续施工。
    这些厂矿是根据“投资少、收效大、利用快”的原则进行扩建和改建的。其中包括火力发电、机械、砩石、水泥、砖瓦、造纸、制药和丝绸等十几种工业。这些工业单位进行扩建、改建后，不仅可以更好地保证完成今年的生产计划，而且对充分发挥地方工业现有设备的潜力也起巨大的作用。例如九个电厂扩建、改建后，可以解决目前和今后相当长的时间内电力供应不足的困难。杭州电厂只增设一个锅炉，发电量每年就可增加七百多万度，能供应两个两万锭子的纱厂用。温州电厂扩建后，各个工厂的白天用电问题可以解决。金华电厂稍事扩建后，比原有的水力发电能力增加二分之一，可以抽出部分电力供应农业灌溉用。四个铁工厂进行扩建平衡设备后将为农业和渔业生产更多更好的器械。公私合营大同电化厂原有的电石生产设备从抗日战争爆发后就废置不用了，现给予少量投资扩建后，今年七月一日可以恢复生产。浙江砩石矿为供应国家炼钢的需要，今年将以勘测新的矿源为主进行扩建。
    扩建和改建的工程中有适应基本建设需要的水泥、油面瓷砖和砖瓦工厂。杭州水泥厂进行投资不大的扩建后，混合水泥的年产量可增加两倍以上。浙江西山窑业厂今年扩建后将进行半机械化的生产，装饰楼房用的油瓷砖产量质量都能大大提高，成本也将降低。大量供应上海和本省需要砖瓦的嘉善砖瓦厂今年也将扩建改用机械炼泥。
    扩建、改建的机器造纸、制药、棉布染织、丝绸、榨油和制革等厂，都将很快地为国家创造大量的财富。例如卷烟纸产量很大的华丰造纸厂只增添一个锅炉车间，每年就可减少停工一月的浪费。浙江制药厂投资十四亿元扩建后，将利用机械浸渍法制造贵重的药品咖啡因，每年可为国家多积累资金二十亿元。
