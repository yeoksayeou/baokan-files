Xinhua News Agency, June 18th: Women from all circles in the capital held a grand gathering at the Tianqiao Theater today to warmly celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China. More than 1,700 women from all walks of life participated in the meeting, including model workers in industry and agriculture, advanced producers, cultural and educational workers, doctors, nurses, and childcare workers, as well as government cadres, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, women from ethnic minorities, and religious circles.

    Wang Ziru, Second Secretary of the Women's Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke first at the meeting. After explaining the great significance of the promulgation of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, she particularly emphasized that the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates the equal rights of women in all aspects. This fully demonstrates that only in a country led by the working class, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao can women enjoy equal rights with men. She called on all women in the city to actively participate in the discussion of the Draft Constitution and to further exert their initiative and creativity, striving to produce, work, and study diligently in their respective posts, and to guarantee the implementation of the Constitution after its official promulgation with practical actions.

    Speaking at the meeting were Liu Shimei, a national textile industry labor model and female worker at the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill; Song Xiuyun, a Beijing agricultural labor model and director of the Zhoujiaxiang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District; Tao Shufan, a Beijing model teacher and vice principal of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University; Yao Shuping, a Beijing special-class model childcare worker and vice president of the June 1st Nursery; Wang Shihe, administrator of the Weijia Hutong woolen production group in Dongsi District; and Sun Ruizhi, a model family member of a Beijing railway worker. They all expressed their heartfelt approval and support for the Draft Constitution based on their own personal experiences. Liu Shimei said that in the old society, we women who were looked down upon are now written into the national law. She used the fact that the female workers of the Qinghe Woolen Mill enjoy various rights to illustrate the happiness that women in New China have already obtained. She finally expressed her intention to celebrate the promulgation of the Draft Constitution by completing their entire group's 1954 production increase and savings plan of more than 640 million yuan.

    The speech by Yao Shuping, Vice President of the June 1st Nursery, moved the entire audience. She used the misfortune encountered by her four sisters in the old society and the free and happy life they have obtained today to illustrate that New China has brought freedom and happiness to women. She said, I am a woman and an educator of children. When I saw the provisions concerning women and children in the Draft Constitution, I deeply felt the happiness of being born in New China and in the era of Mao Zedong. During the meeting, many people requested to speak, and notes were constantly passed to the rostrum, and the atmosphere was extremely warm.

    At the end of the meeting, amidst prolonged applause and cheers, a resolution supporting the Draft Constitution was unanimously passed. They raised their hands and shouted slogans: "Support the Draft Constitution!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    六一幼儿院副院长姚淑平的讲话，感动了全场听众。她以她自己姐妹四人在旧社会遭遇的不幸和今天获得的自由幸福生活，说明新中国给妇女带来自由和幸福。她说，我是个妇女，是孩子的教养者，当我看到宪法草案中有关妇女和儿童的规定时，我深深感到生长在新中国，生长在毛泽东时代的幸福。大会进行中，很多人要求发言，纸条不断传上主席台，全场情绪极为热烈。
    大会最后在经久不息的掌声和欢呼声中一致通过了拥护宪法草案的决议，她们举手高呼“拥护宪法草案！”“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号。
