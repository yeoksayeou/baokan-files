Across the country, grain departments are strengthening grain storage work to ensure the safe passage of stored grain through the summer.

[This News] With the arrival of hot and rainy weather, a season when grain is prone to mildew and insect infestation, grain departments across the country are further strengthening grain storage work to ensure that stored grain safely passes through the summer.

Since the first quarter of this year, grain departments across the country have conducted grain stocktaking to understand the status of stored grain. At the same time, they have vigorously handled unsafe grain. By mid-March, Guangdong, Hunan, and Henan provinces had essentially completed grain stocktaking in over 230 counties and had turned and sun-dried a batch of grain. By the end of April, grain departments in the North China region had processed approximately 550 million catties of grain at risk of spoilage. Grain departments in Anhui Province, under the slogan of "Not letting a sunny day pass, not leaving a drying ground idle, not stopping a single drying room, not halting a single winnowing machine or sieve," turned and dried high-moisture grain. In February, unsafe grain accounted for 37.3 percent of the total inventory in the province, but by April, it had decreased to 12 percent of the total inventory. Grain departments in many areas of the Northeast region launched grain drying competitions. By early May, the task of drying damp grain across the region was more than 55 percent complete. Combined with the grain stocktaking work, grain departments in various regions also widely carried out warehouse cleaning and sanitation work. Grain departments in the East China region widely promoted the experience of creating insect-free granaries pioneered by Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province, and carried out warehouse cleaning. According to statistics from 41 counties and cities including Fenghua, Yin County, and Wu Kang in Zhejiang Province, over 7,000 people participated in this work, removing more than 10,000 catties of insect cocoons, insect corpses, spider webs, and dust, and more than 40,000 dan of garbage and weeds. Before the arrival of the plum rain season, grain storage cadres in 95 counties in Sichuan Province launched a competition for grain storage work. In the competition, they all took Yu Hang County's insect-free granary as an example and widely carried out a major cleaning of granaries. Many grain departments in various regions have set plans to create insect-free granaries as well as mold-free granaries and standard clean and sanitary granaries. A number of insect-free granaries have already emerged in Wangjiang County and Dangtu County in Anhui Province, Boai County and Song County in Henan Province, and other places. A number of standard clean granaries have emerged in Jinxian County and Fengcheng County in Jiangxi Province, creating favorable conditions for doing a good job in summer grain storage work.

Based on local climate changes, grain departments in various regions have successively strengthened the work of turning and drying grain, preventing floods and rain, and eliminating warehouse insects. On March 17, the Grain Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government issued an urgent directive requiring grain departments in various parts of Guangdong to step up the drying and processing of grain with high moisture content and high temperatures to ensure the safe passage of stored grain through the rainy season. Since the second half of April, in addition to turning and drying grain on sunny days and spreading it out to dry on cloudy days, grain storage personnel in Changsha City, Hunan Province, have also used methods such as "greenhouse drying" to reduce grain moisture on rainy days. The Shaodong County Grain Department shortened the originally scheduled grain storage inspection period and strengthened ventilation, turning, and drying. Since May, grain depots in Beijing have launched a grain protection work competition, covering open-air grain stacks with mats, dredging and repairing ditches next to the grain stacks, "cold storing and sealing" the dried grain, and strengthening the elimination of overwintering warehouse insects. Since the beginning of June, the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Department has also launched a summer grain inspection focused on preventing mildew, killing insects, and checking the plan to create insect-free granaries.

    各地粮食部门加强粮食保管工作
    争取仓储粮食安全度夏
    【本报讯】目前已进入天热雨多的、粮食容易霉坏和生虫的季节。各地粮食部门正进一步加强粮食保管工作，争取使仓储粮食安全度过夏季。
    今年第一季度以来，各地粮食部门进行了存粮普查工作，了解了仓储粮食的情况，同时大力处理了不安全的粮食。三月中旬，广东、湖南、河南三省即有二百三十多个县基本完成了存粮普查工作，并翻晒了一批粮食。华北区粮食部门到四月末，即处理了约五亿五千万斤有变质危险的粮食。安徽省粮食部门在“不放过一个晴天，不空闲一块晒场，不冷一座烘干室，不停一个风车、筛子”的口号下，对高水分粮食进行了翻晒整理。二月间，该省不安全粮食占库存总数的百分之三十七点三，到四月份降低到占库存总数的百分之十二。东北区不少地区的粮食部门开展了粮食晾晒竞赛，到五月初，全区潮粮翻晒任务已完成百分之五十五以上。结合粮食普查工作，各地粮食部门还广泛进行了仓库清洁卫生工作。华东区各地粮食部门普遍推广了浙江省余杭县创造无虫粮仓的经验，开展了清扫仓库的工作。据浙江省奉化、鄞县、武康等四十一个县、市的统计，参加这一工作的有七千多人，清除虫茧、虫尸、蛛网、灰尘一万多斤，垃圾、杂草四万多担。四川省九十五个县的粮食保管干部在梅雨季节到来以前，开展了粮食保管工作的竞赛。竞赛中都以余杭县的无虫粮仓为榜样，广泛开展了粮仓清洁大扫除。各地许多粮食部门定出了创造无虫粮仓以及无霉仓、标准清洁卫生仓的计划。安徽省望江县、当涂县、河南省博爱县、嵩县等地已有一批无虫粮库，江西省进贤县、丰城县等地已出现了一批标准清洁粮库。这都为作好夏季粮食保管工作创造了有利条件。
    根据各地气候变化情况，各地粮食部门先后加强了翻晒粮食、防汛防雨、清除仓虫等工作。广东省人民政府粮食厅在三月十七日即发出紧急指示，要求广东各地粮食部门加紧晾晒和处理水分大、温度高的粮食，以保证存粮安度雨季。四月下半月以来，湖南省长沙市的粮食保管人员除在晴天翻晒、阴天摊晾粮食以外，在下雨天，还采用“温室烘干”等办法降低粮食水分；邵东县粮食部门缩短了原定的储粮检查期限，加强了通风、翻晒等工作。北京市各粮库从五月份以来开展了护粮工作竞赛，对露天粮囤加苫席子，疏通和整修粮囤旁的水沟，对晾晒过的粮食进行“冷存密封”，同时加强了消灭越冬仓虫等工作。浙江省粮食部门还从六月初起以防霉、杀虫、检查创造无虫粮仓计划为重点，展开了夏季粮食大会查。
