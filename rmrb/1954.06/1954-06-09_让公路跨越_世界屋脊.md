Let the Highway Cross the "Roof of the World"
By our correspondent, He Li

In these days of peace, it is difficult for the average person to imagine that our economic construction, our struggle with nature, is as arduous and intense as war. In the past revolutionary wars, our People's Liberation Army stood at the forefront of the struggle, defeating imperialism and feudalism. Today, in the struggle with nature, our People's Liberation Army is once again at the forefront, together with the advanced working class, undertaking the most arduous engineering construction. The construction of the Kangzang Highway is one of these most arduous engineering projects.

If we open a map of China, we can see that in the eastern part of our country there are railways and highways running north and south, and the railways in the northeast are as dense as a spider's web. In the northwest, there are not many railways, but highways can reach the remote Xinjiang. In the southwest, apart from the relatively developed transportation in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, there is no highway passing through the vast Kangzang Plateau. Before liberation, during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, although a Sichuan-Kang-Qing Highway was built, it was never open to traffic except for the short section from Chengdu to Ya'an. The people's transportation to and from Chengdu to Lhasa, a total of five thousand three hundred and fifty li, had to rely on the old-fashioned post roads and slow-moving yaks. A round trip often took a year.

In 1950, the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet. In order to help the Tibetan people build a happy life, there was an urgent need to build a highway to Lhasa. Thus, with the restoration of the Sichuan-Kang-Qing Highway, in June 1951, the Kangzang Highway, which is considered the most arduous project in the world, began construction.

Fighting on the "Roof of the World"

The Kangzang Highway (newly built section) is 1,661 kilometers long, starting from Manigange on the Kangqing Highway in the east, passing through Qamdo, Songzong, and Taizhao, and reaching Lhasa directly. It crosses the famous "Roof of the World," the Kangzang Plateau.

The mountains on the Roof of the World are truly extraordinary. The most famous mountains in China are the Five Great Mountains, but their height is only 900 to 2,300 meters above sea level. Most of the dozen or so large mountains crossed by the Kangzang Highway are above 4,000 meters above sea level. Taking only the highest points of the highway, Que'er Mountain is 5,050 meters, Yujila is 4,950 meters, Damala is 4,810 meters, and Yela is 4,740 meters.

The higher the mountain, the greater the difficulties it poses to us.

At altitudes above 4,500 meters, there is snow cover for at least half the year, and in some places, it is snow-covered all year round. Here, the ground is often covered with one to three or four meters of snow, and the ground is frozen to a depth of more than one meter. Construction in such areas is extremely difficult. Not to mention the extreme cold and thin air that erodes the human body every minute and every second, just digging the frozen earth is a very arduous task. You can use a new type of shovel, but sometimes you can only make a mark; you can use explosives, but you can't blast a very big hole. On Que'er Mountain, the soldiers used "fire attack" to conquer the frozen earth. But at altitudes above 4,500 meters, the climate is too cold, and trees are hard to grow. Where does the firewood come from? Therefore, the soldiers had to run tens of miles every day to chop and carry firewood. Imagine: the frozen earth on the twenty-odd-kilometer long highway across the top of Que'er Mountain, how much firewood would it take to burn it all? Digging frozen earth also has a major difficulty, which is that it freezes again tomorrow after being dug up today, and the lower layer freezes after the upper layer is dug up. But our stubborn soldiers burned it layer by layer and dug it layer by layer, finally conquering the frozen earth.

Along the highway, there are cliffs and precipices composed of solid rock everywhere, such as the Nujiang River, Ranwu Gully, and Niu Ta Gully. The cliffs on both sides stand tall, and the foot of the mountain plunges straight into the bottom of the gully. There is a mountain above and a river below, with very little space to set foot in between. In such areas, many highway design lines are in the middle of the rock wall, neither touching the sky nor the ground. It is very difficult not only to open roads but even to go up and down! What to do? Our soldiers and migrant workers all adopted suspended operations. First, they opened a trail on the top of the cliff, and then drove a row of steel brazing nails along the trail on the edge of the cliff. A thick rope with a diameter of one inch was tied to the steel brazing nails, and two or three thin ropes were tied to the lower end of the thick rope. The soldiers and technicians tied themselves to the thin ropes, tightly clung to the thick rope with both hands, and stepped on the cliff wall with their feet, and began operations suspended in the middle of the rock cliff. The soldiers worked in groups of two, one holding the drill and the other hitting the hammer. In places where the slope on the cliff was smaller, the soldiers and technicians could carve out a step and stand upright to work. In places where the slope was too steep or vertical, they could only face the cliff sideways, using one foot to hold the cliff rock and one foot to step on the rope to work. To conquer such rocks, one cannot simply rely on human strength to knock with a hammer. Explosions must be used. Therefore, the main task of people working on the cliff rock is to drill blasting holes and install explosives. Through a series of explosions, roads began to appear.

The soldiers experienced great dangers to conquer these cliffs and precipices. The Nujiang River and Niu Ta Gully were both constructed day and night. Look! Thousands upon thousands of hemp ropes hang thousands upon thousands of soldiers, like clusters of grapes hanging on the hills. Piles of firewood are arranged like a fire dragon, illuminating the dark valleys. The soldiers' songs, the sound of iron hammers, and the roar of the cold wind and the roar of the river waves formed countless heart-stirring symphonies. Soldiers and migrant workers go up and down the construction site along the ropes all day long like apes. This cannot help but remind people of acrobats, but the soft ropes they hang on high poles are only ten or so meters long, while the ropes that the soldiers hang on are thirty or forty meters long. Acrobats only perform on the ropes for a few minutes, while soldiers and technicians work all day and night. Cliffs tens of meters high have been leveled! Stone mountains have been split in two! All dangerous cliffs and solid rocks have succumbed to our soldiers and technicians.

The most troublesome projects are quicksand and "rubber roads." There are many quicksand areas on the Kangzang Highway. The area where quicksand is most concentrated is Niu Ta Gully. Niu Ta Gully is about 30 kilometers long, and in addition to the steep stone walls, there are 27 quicksand areas. The so-called quicksand is the sand slope formed by the weathering of mountain stones. People are digging below, and it flows from above. The top cannot stop flowing, and the bottom cannot stop digging. The most annoying thing is that the sand is mixed with countless large and small stones. When the sand flows down, the stones roll down silently. Our soldiers and migrant workers often work under iron buckets. They first drive wooden stakes into the sand slopes, and sometimes rows of wooden stakes are washed away. Sometimes sand leaks out from the gaps between the stakes. Now they have used the method of internal retaining walls in some areas (that is, building a stone wall where the foot of the quicksand slope meets the roadbed) to block the quicksand, and the harm of the quicksand has gradually been overcome by the heroes who built the road.

"Rubber road" is really a naughty road. This kind of road is originally in places where the soil is thick and there is a groundwater source. The soil on the ground is often soaked by water and becomes very deep sludge. When a car drives over it, it is like a trap that sinks the wheels. When this kind of road was first built, due to lack of experience, only firewood was filled on the surface, but one layer was filled and one layer sank, and there was no end to the sinking, and the problem of vehicles getting stuck was still not solved. Finally, the sludge was completely removed, and it was dug all the way to the hard bottom. Then, from the bottom to the surface, all the stones were padded, and the problem of traffic was solved.

Engineering Democracy and Technical Creation Movement

The engineering on the Kangzang Plateau is very arduous, but all the obstacles on the plateau have been conquered by our heroic People's Liberation Army and migrant workers. The "Engineering Democracy and Technical Creation Movement" carried out in the troops is the most important driving force for them to overcome all obstacles.

Many of our soldiers did not know the benefits of using technology when they started construction due to lack of scientific knowledge. At that time, they only used the simple slogan of "enduring great hardships and exerting great efforts." They worked from morning to night, from night to morning, working for more than a dozen hours a day, consuming a lot of physical strength, and suffering many injuries and illnesses, but the work efficiency was low. In 1951, when Que'er Mountain was built, many troops did not reach the standard work efficiency.

In 1952, the leading organs of the troops began to put forward the slogans of "combining physical strength and intelligence" and "combining physical strength and technology," and vigorously advocated using wisdom and technology to conquer nature. But at that time, there were still many comrades who did not believe in science and technology. When the superiors asked them to summarize their experience, they said: "Great strength is experience!" "Stones won't run without strength!"

However, this kind of thinking was only temporary after all. With the development of scientific thought, a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army put forward the slogan of "five evaluations," evaluating work efficiency, evaluating technology, evaluating labor discipline, evaluating unity, and evaluating hygiene, and implemented the spirit of "combining physical strength and intelligence" and "combining physical strength and technology." In this way, new technologies appeared. For example, originally, soil was carried by people one load at a time, which was very slow. Later, they tied the two iron dustpans for carrying soil together side by side, tied a stick behind them to push, and tied a rope in front to pull. The two people operated together, one pushing and one pulling, which doubled the work efficiency. For example, to cut down trees, it was necessary to saw down the trees first and then dig the roots. Later, they developed the "tree-felling method," which started by digging the roots, first digging half of them, and then using the natural tilting force to pull them down. This greatly improved work efficiency in forest areas. Many soldiers studied technology with heart, and some infantrymen also began to learn how to build bridges. The creativity of the masses is inseparable from the democratic movement of the masses. Due to the development of the collective wisdom of the masses, a vigorous atmosphere was aroused in the troops, and some past psychological states of lack of confidence and fear began to be overcome.

In order to further promote the role of science and technology, the leading organs of the troops combined opinions from all sides and proposed to carry out the "Engineering Democracy and Technical Creation" movement. After two years of promotion in 1952 and 1953, the technology of the road construction troops has been brilliantly developed.

For example, in the most arduous project of blasting rock cliffs, they created a series of methods. At the beginning of blasting, their work efficiency was not high because they were not good at organizing forces. Later, they gradually realized the connection between gunpowder explosions and, according to different terrains, created the plum blossom blasting method, the group blasting method, and the cascade blasting method (that is, drilling a long row of blasting holes from top to bottom in sloping areas, installing continuous fuses, and detonating them continuously layer by layer from top to bottom after ignition), which greatly exerted the power of blasting. At the beginning, they could only set off small cannons, which could only blast one or two cubic meters (one cubic meter is one cubic meter). Later, they gradually learned to set off large cannons, which could blast tens or hundreds of cubic meters in one shot. In Niu Ta Gully, one cannon once blasted more than 4,000 cubic meters. The biggest problem in blasting is flying rocks injuring people. At the beginning of blasting, the fuse burned too fast and was difficult to control, often causing casualties. In order to control the timing of ignition, Comrade Liu Moqing of a certain department created the "white twisted ignition method." He used cotton to make a wick and connected it to the fuse. Because the burning speed of the cotton wick was slow, it was 30 times slower than the fuse. This allowed the igniter to have ample time to leave the danger zone. This not only greatly ensured the safety of the work, but also saved the country a lot of wealth due to the shortening of the fuse.

The "Engineering Democracy and Technical Creation Movement" played a great role in the troops. It not only brought into play the collective wisdom of the soldiers but also enhanced the troops' confidence in conquering nature.

Heroic Spirit and Optimism

In building roads on high mountains, the People's Liberation Army and migrant workers live a hard life that ordinary people cannot imagine. But the Chinese People's Liberation Army demonstrated extremely noble heroism and optimism in the battle to conquer the Kangzang Plateau.

"Difficulty is glory, tenacity is victory!"
"The stones of Que'er Mountain are strong, but not as strong as our will!"
"The peaks of Que'er Mountain are high, but not as high as our soles!"

Listen, these are the heroic words of the heroes.

The Kangzang Plateau is subject to unpredictable weather. On the plateau, it is windy every afternoon. Road builders are often attacked by blizzards and hailstorms swept up by strong winds. The harsh wind and snow temper our soldiers every day. Whenever wind and snow come, they use iron shovels to cover their faces, and when hailstones come, they use iron buckets or dirt baskets to cover their heads. After the wind, snow, and hail pass, they continue to work. They often work day and night on the ice-covered and snow-covered mountaintops and deep valleys. When Que'er Mountain and Niu Ta Gully were under construction, it was the middle of winter, and the temperature dropped to minus 20 or 30 degrees Celsius. The soldiers' hands and feet were frozen with cracks, but they were not afraid. There is a famous allegro poem "Plateau Warriors" on the plateau, which is the collective creation of the soldiers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit. It is most sufficient to express the heroic spirit and optimism of ordinary soldiers. They wrote in the poem:

	"Hail, it's nothing!
	We say it's playing the sanxian.
	Washing clothes, very convenient,
	It's hygienic and doesn't cost money.
	Hail is like mothballs,
	Snowflakes are like good washing soda.
	Washed all over,
	It dries immediately when the sun comes out,
	Wash it several times a day,
	It doesn't hinder our construction!"

Building roads on high mountains can only be accommodated on high mountains. Without houses on the mountain, you can only set up tents on the ice and snow. Tents cannot withstand strong winds and heavy snow. Sometimes a heavy snowfall collapses the tent, and people who are sleeping soundly in their fatigue at night are buried in the snow along with the tent. Sometimes a gust of wind blows the tent away, and people have to get out of bed and chase the tent. In the rainy season, some old and poor-quality tents are even more troublesome: "It rains heavily outside, it rains lightly inside, it doesn't rain outside, and it still rains inside." In low-lying areas, sometimes it rains so heavily that even the tents float up. Soldiers and migrant workers sleep on the ice-covered and rain-soaked ground with wooden sticks and branches a foot thick laid on them. People sleep soundly on them, and water rushes below. Tent life is so hard, but what do they say?

	"Tents are set up on icebergs,
	We sleep on glass beds at night,
	There is the sound of running water under the glass bed,
	Comrades say it sounds like music."

The longer the highway extends, the more convenient the supply to the forward troops. This is the general situation. But this is not the case at road construction sites, because there are many troops and migrant workers building roads, and the first phase of the project extends from seventy or eighty kilometers to more than one hundred kilometers. Many work sections are fortunate to have a small road to walk on when construction starts. In high mountains and deep valleys and on cliffs and precipices, there is often not even a small road. In such areas, even yaks are useless, and only people can carry it on their backs. Sometimes, even carrying people on their backs and yaks cannot keep up, and food and clothing cannot be supplied. Soldiers and migrant workers work selflessly in a state of insufficient food supply. For example, the troops in Nujiang encountered floods during road construction. There were no bridges and no roads, and food could not be transported across the river. The troops who crossed the river first often ate porridge and had not eaten oil or salt for almost two months.

Although the supply on the Kangzang Plateau is very difficult, the soldiers, especially the comrades in the cooking班, overcome the difficulties with incomparable perseverance. The cooking class of the Fourth Company of a certain unit (this is the most famous cooking class on the plateau) once put forward such heroic words: "We must make rice even without rice!" In order to provide food and drink for the entire company, they often spent a lot of manpower to hunt wild animals and dig wild vegetables in the wild. They also wanted to find a way to sprout soybeans on the snowy mountains. The same soybeans can be made into dozens of different dishes after grinding into tofu and sprouting bean sprouts. Therefore, even in the most difficult times, they ensured that the entire company had two meals a day, and each meal did not have the same dishes. Their exemplary actions moved all the soldiers of the company to say: "Whether we eat or not, work efficiency must be increased by one and a half times!"

The heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army road construction troops treat difficulties with such optimism. Therefore, no difficulty cannot be conquered.

Why does the Chinese People's Liberation Army have such noble heroism and optimism? We can answer with the words of a young soldier. When a comrade saw a young soldier working in the mud in the rain, he asked him: "Comrade, do you feel bitter?" The young soldier glanced at him and replied calmly: "Comrade! It is difficult for anyone to give us a good explanation of whether it is bitter or not. We are working here day and night, it is bitter! Of course, there is a little bit. But there is a lot of sweetness in our bitterness! You know, when we succeed in construction, how much power will the motherland have increased! As long as there is this sweetness, our bitterness is nothing!" Just as a comrade in the troops wrote in a poem: "Sow a seed in the spring, and get ten thousand grains in return. Shed one more drop of sweat, and get good times in return!" This is the source of all their power.

    让公路跨越“世界屋脊”
    本报记者　贺笠
    在这和平的日子里，一般人很难想到我们的经济建设，我们与大自然的斗争，也和战争一样的艰巨与剧烈。在过去的几次革命战争中，我们的解放军是站在斗争的最前列，打败了帝国主义和封建主义。今天，在与大自然的斗争中，我们的解放军又是站在最前列，与先进的工人阶级一起，担负了最艰巨的工程建设。修筑康藏公路正是这种最艰巨的工程建设之一。
    如果我们把地图翻开，在我国的东部有着贯通南北的铁路和公路，东北的铁路更是密如蛛网。在西北，铁路是不多了，但公路还可通达辽远的新疆。在西南，除四川、云南、贵州有比较发达的交通之外，在广阔的康藏高原，却无一条公路通行。解放前国民党匪帮统治时期，虽曾修筑过一条川康青公路，但除成都到雅安短短一段之外，素来是不通车的。人民的往返运输，由成都到拉萨，共有五千三百五十华里，都不能不依赖旧式的驿道和行动迟缓的毛牛。往返一趟常常要费一年的时间。
    一九五○年中国人民解放军进军西藏，为了帮助藏族人民建立幸福生活，不能不急迫地要求修筑一条通往拉萨的公路。这样随着川康青公路的修复，在一九五一年六月，这条在世界上也认为是最艰巨的工程——康藏公路，就开始修筑了。
    战斗在“世界屋脊”上
    康藏公路（新建部分）全长一千六百六十一公里，东边自康青公路上的马尼根果起，经昌都、松宗、太昭，直达拉萨。它跨越着著名的“世界屋脊”康藏高原。
    世界屋脊上的山，真是异乎寻常的山，中国最著名的山莫过于五岳了，但五岳的高度也不过拔海九百公尺至二千三百公尺，而康藏公路所经过的十几座大山，大部海拔都在四千公尺以上。单以公路通过的最高点来说，在雀儿山是五千零五十公尺，育吉拉是四千九百五十公尺，达马拉是四千八百一十公尺，业拉是四千七百四十公尺。
    山势越高，给我们造成的困难越大。
    在四千五百公尺以上的高山，每年至少有半年以上的时间积雪，有的地方甚至是终年积雪。在这里地面经常覆盖着一公尺至三、四公尺的大雪，地下凝结着一公尺多厚的冻土，在这样的地区施工是非常艰苦的，且不说极度的寒冷与稀薄的空气每分每秒都在侵蚀着人身，光挖掘冻土就是非常艰巨的。你用新式挖，有时只能划一个印；你用炸药炸，也炸不了多大的窟窿。在雀儿山上，战士们为了征服冻土，实行用“火攻”。但在四千五百公尺以上的高山上，由于气候太冷，草木难生，那里来的柴呢？因此战士们每天要跑到数十里以外的地方去砍柴背柴。可以想想：在横跨雀儿山山顶二十多公里长的公路线上的冻土，那不知要多少柴才能把它烧得化哟！挖冻土还有一个最大的困难，就是今天挖开明天又冻了，上层挖开下层又冻了。但是我们倔强的战士，就这样一层一层地烧，一层一层地挖，终于把冻土征服了。
    在公路沿线，到处都有由坚石构成的悬崖绝壁，如怒江、然屋沟、牛踏沟，两岸峭壁矗立，山脚直插沟底，上面是山，下面是河，中间很少有能够插足之地。在这样的地区，公路设计线很多都在石壁的中腰，上不着天，下不着地，不要说开辟道路，连上下都十分困难！怎么办呢？我们的战士和民工都采取悬空作业，先在绝壁的顶上开出一条便道，然后沿着便道在崖边打下一列钢钎，在钢钎上系上一条直径一寸的粗绳，在粗绳的下端再系上两三条细绳，战士和技工把自己捆在细绳上，用两手紧攀着粗绳，用两脚登着崖壁，就这样吊在石崖的半腰开始作业了。战士们作业是以两个人为一组，一人掌钎，一人打锤。在崖上坡度较小的地方，战士和技工还可以掏出一个台阶直立作业，在坡度太陡或垂直的地方，就只能侧身向着崖边，用一只脚登住崖石，一只脚踩住绳子工作。要征服这样的岩石，绝不能单凭人力一锤锤的敲打，必须采用爆炸的办法。因此人在崖石上的作业主要是打炮眼，装炸药，通过一系列的爆炸，道路就开始出现了。
    战士们为了征服这些悬崖绝壁，曾经历了很大的艰险。怒江与牛踏沟都是昼夜施工的。看啊！成千成万的麻绳吊着成千成万的战士，好像累累的葡萄挂满了山岗。一堆堆的柴火，排列得像一条火龙，把幽暗的峡谷照得通明。战士们的歌声，铁锤声，与寒风的怒吼，江涛的轰鸣，奏成了无数支动人心魄的交响曲。战士和民工们成天如猿猴一样地沿着绳子上下工地，这不禁使人想起玩杂技的人，但是他们在高杆上所吊的软绳也不过十来公尺，而战士们所吊的绳子则是三、四十公尺；玩杂技的在绳子上不过数分钟的表演，而战士们和技工则是成天累夜的劳动。数十公尺的高崖夷为平地了！一座座的石山劈成两截了！一切险崖坚石都在我们战士和技工的面前屈服了。
    最麻烦的工程莫过于流沙与“橡皮路”。康藏公路上有许多流沙地带，流沙最集中的地区在牛踏沟。牛踏沟长约三十公里，除峻峭的石壁外，就有二十七处流沙。所谓流沙就是山上石头经过风化所形成的沙坡。人在下面开，它从上面流，上面流不尽，下面挖不尽。最讨厌的是沙里还夹杂着无数大小石块，当沙在下流的时候，石头也不声不响地滚下来，我们的战士和民工常常顶着铁皮桶施工。他们先在沙坡上打木桩，有时候一排排的木桩被冲垮了。有时候石沙从桩缝中漏出来。现在他们已在一些地区用内堡坎的办法（即在流沙坡脚与路基相接处修一道石墙）来堵流沙，流沙的危害也逐渐被筑路的英雄克服了。
    “橡皮路”真是一种顽皮路。这种路原是在泥土厚而又具有地下水源的地方，地面的泥土常常被水浸渍而变成很深的污泥，汽车从上面驶过，它好像陷阱一样就把车轮陷下去了。这种路初修时由于没有经验，只在表面填木柴，但是填一层陷一层，填一层陷一层，陷得没有止境，仍然解决不了陷车问题，最后还是彻底排除了污泥，一直挖到硬底，然后从底到面，全部垫上石头，才解决了通车问题。
      工程民主技术创造运动
    康藏高原的工程是非常艰巨的，但是高原上的一切障碍都被我们英雄的人民解放军和民工所征服了。部队中所开展的“工程民主技术创造运动”，正是他们克服一切障碍最重要的推动力。
    我们许多战士开始施工时，由于缺乏科学知识，还不知道利用技术的好处。那时他们只是以简单的
  “吃大苦，出大力”的口号相号召，他们从早到晚、从夜到明的劳动，一天工作十几个钟头，体力消耗很大，伤病很多，但是工作效率低。在一九五一年修雀儿山时许多部队都未达到标准工效。
    一九五二年，部队的领导机关开始提出“体力与智力结合”、“体力与技术结合”的口号，大力提倡用智慧用技术征服自然。但是当时仍有不少同志是不相信科学与技术的。上级要他们总结经验，他们说：“力气大就是经验！”“不用力气石头就不会跑！”
    但是，这种思想毕竟只是暂时的。随着科学思想的发展，解放军某团提出了“五评”的口号，评工效，评技术，评劳动纪律，评团结，评卫生，贯彻了“体力与智力结合”、“体力与技术结合”的精神，这样，新的技术出现了。如挑土原来是由人一担一担地挑，挑得很慢，以后他们把挑土的两个铁簸箕并排地绑在一起，后面绑一根棍子推，前面系一条绳子拉，两人一起操作，一推一拉，使工作效率提高了一倍。如砍树从前要先把树锯倒而后挖根，以后他们研究出“倒树法”，一开始就挖根，先挖掉一半，然后利用自然的倾斜力把它拉倒，这样在森林区作业就大大提高了工作效率。许多战士都用心学技术，有些步兵也开始学会搭桥了。群众的创造与群众的民主运动是分不开的，由于群众集体智慧的发展，引起部队中一股蓬勃的气象，过去某些信心不足与畏惧的心理开始克服了。
    为了进一步发挥科学与技术的作用，部队的领导机关综合各方面的意见，提出开展“工程民主技术创造”运动的号召，经过一九五二年、一九五三年两年的推行，使筑路部队的技术得到光辉的发展。
    如最艰巨的爆破石崖工程，他们创造了一系列的办法。开始爆破时由于他们不善于组织力量，工作效率不高。后来他们逐渐体会出火药爆炸的联系作用，根据不同地形，创造了梅花爆破法、集团爆破法和梯级爆破法（即在斜坡地方自上至下打一长列炮眼、装置连续的导火线，在点火后使其自上至下连续地一层层地爆炸），大大发挥了爆破的威力。他们开始时只会放小炮，一炮只炸一、二方（一方即一立方公尺），后来逐渐学会放大炮，一炮要炸数十方、数百方。在牛踏沟曾有一炮炸掉四千多方。在放炮当中最大的问题是飞石伤人。开始放炮时由于导火绳燃烧太快，难于控制，常常引起伤亡。为了控制点火的时效，某部刘墨青同志创造了
  “白捻点火法”。他用棉花搓成捻子，接在导火绳上，因棉捻燃烧速度缓慢，比导火绳要慢三十倍，这样使点火的人能够有充裕的时间离开危险圈。这不仅大大保证了工作的安全，而且由于导火绳的缩短，为国家节约了大批财富。
      “工程民主技术创造运动”在部队中发生了极大的作用，它不仅发挥了战士的集体智慧，而且增强了部队征服自然的信心。
    英雄气概和乐观主义
    在高山筑路中，解放军和民工都过着一般人想像不到的辛苦生活。但是中国人民解放军在征服康藏高原的战斗中，表现了极为崇高的英雄气概与乐观主义。
    “困难就是光荣，顽强就是胜利！”
   “雀儿山的石头坚，没有我们的意志坚！”
   “雀儿山的山峰高，没有我们的脚板高！”
    听呵，这就是英雄们的豪语。
    康藏高原风云变化无常。在高原上每天下午都是要刮风的。修路的人常常受到狂风卷着雪团和冰雹的袭击。严酷的风雪天天磨练着我们的战士，每当风雪打来的时候，他们就用铁锹遮脸，冰雹打来的时候，就用铁皮桶或土筐盖头。等风雪冰雹过去他们又继续工作。他们常常在冰封雪盖的山顶上和深谷里昼夜施工，在雀儿山和牛踏沟施工时正遇隆冬，温度降至零下二、三十度，战士两手两脚冻得满是裂口，但是他们并不畏惧。高原上有一首著名的快板诗“高原战士”，是某部八连战士的集体创作，最足以表现一般战士的英雄气概和乐观主义精神，他们在诗里这样写道：
        “下冰雹，没有啥！
      咱们说是弹三弦。
      洗衣服，很方便，
      又讲卫生又不花钱。
      冰雹好比卫生球，
      雪片就是好洋碱。
      浑身上下都洗过，
      太阳一出马上干，
        一天洗它好几遍，
      并不妨碍咱修建！”
    在高山上筑路，也只能在高山上住宿。山上无房只能在冰雪上面搭帐篷。帐篷是经不起大风大雪的，有时一场大雪把帐篷压塌了，夜间在疲劳中酣睡的人，连人带帐篷都被埋在雪里。有时一阵大风又把帐篷刮跑了，人们还得从床上爬起来赶帐篷。一到雨季，有些破旧的和质量不好的帐篷就更麻烦了，“外面下大雨，里面下小雨，外面不下雨，里面还下雨”。在低洼的地方，有时雨下得太大，连帐篷也浮起来了。在冰封雨淋的地上战士们和民工都铺着一尺来厚的木棍和树枝睡觉，人在上面沉沉地酣睡，水在下面嘶嘶地奔流。帐篷生活是那样艰苦，但是他们怎样说呢？
      “帐篷架在冰山上，
      夜晚睡的玻璃床，
      玻璃床下流水声，
      同志们说是音乐响。”
    公路愈延伸长对于前面部队的供应愈便利，这是就一般状况来说的。但是在筑路工地却并不如此，因为筑路的部队和民工很多，一期工程就绵延七、八十公里到一百多公里。许多工段在兴工时有小路可走就是不错的，在高山深谷、悬崖绝壁，往往连小路也没有。在这样的地区连毛牛也用不上，只有用人背。有时人背牛驮都来不及，粮食衣服供给不上，战士和民工就在食物供应不足的状态下忘我地劳动。如在怒江的部队，筑路时正遇洪水，无桥无路，粮食运不过河，先过江的部队经常吃稀饭，差不多有两个月没吃过油盐。
    康藏高原的供应虽然非常艰苦，但战士们——特别是炊事班的同志们，都以无比的毅力来克服困难。某部四连炊事班（这是高原上最有名的炊事班）曾经提出这样的豪语：“无米也要做成饭！”，他们为了全连的吃喝，常常花很大的人力到野外去捉野物和挖野菜。在雪山上也要想出办法生豆芽，一样的黄豆经过磨豆腐发豆芽可以做出几十样不同的菜，因此即是在最困难的时候他们也保证了全连每天两顿饭，每餐不吃重样菜。他们的模范行动感动得全连战士都说：“吃饭不吃饭，工作效率也要提高一倍半！”
    英雄的中国人民解放军筑路部队，就是以这样的乐观主义来对待困难，因此，任何困难是没有不被征服的。
    为什么中国人民解放军有这样高贵的英雄气概与乐观主义呢？我们可以举一个青年战士的话来回答。当一个同志看见一位青年战士冒雨在泥地里工作，向他问道：“同志，你觉得苦吗？”这个青年战士看了他一眼，冷静地回答道：“同志！苦与不苦，谁也很难给我们作一个很好的解释。我们在这里夜以继日地干，苦！当然有一点。但我们这个苦里却有很多的甜！你知道，当我们修建成功的时候，祖国又增加了多大一份力量啊！只要有这个甜在，我们的苦就算不得什么了！”正如部队中一个同志所写的一首诗：“春撒一粒子，换来万颗粮。多流一滴汗，换来好时光！”这就是他们一切力量的源泉。
