Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Indian delegation attending the International Conference on Easing Tensions held a press conference on the 21st, inviting Swedish and foreign journalists.

The Indian delegation (comprising fourteen members, six of whom are members of the Indian Parliament) issued a statement at the press conference stating: The conference is being conducted in a friendly atmosphere, and all delegates do not wish to condemn anyone, but only to achieve mutual understanding. We are convinced that this conference will be successful.

Although our delegation is composed of people with various beliefs, we share a single opinion on certain principles:

First, we believe that disputes can and must be resolved through consultation. We believe that war is a coercive means and must be prohibited.

Second, we believe that countries with different political and economic systems can coexist peacefully.

Third, we believe that every country must enjoy full freedom and independence. No country should be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries under any pretext.

Next, the statement put forward the following suggestions from the Indian delegation:

	(1) An immediate ceasefire in Indochina should be achieved, granting the people of Indochina the right to freedom without interference from the French government.

	(2) An agreement should be reached on a lasting peace in Korea, guaranteeing the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and granting the Korean people the right to decide their own future.

	(3) All types of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, as well as all types of weapons of mass destruction, should be banned.

	(4) Armaments should be reduced gradually and proportionally, in order to achieve complete disarmament when possible.

	(5) Negotiations between the Four Powers on a peaceful solution to the German question should be resumed. This solution should guarantee the establishment of a unified, fully independent Germany with the freedom to choose any political and economic system.

	(6) Close cultural and economic relations between countries should be developed, eliminating the various obstacles and prohibitions that currently exist.

	(7) The People's Republic of China should participate in the work of the United Nations. As our Prime Minister has said, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, problems in Asia or the world cannot be resolved.

Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, June 24th, TASS dispatch: The Japanese delegation attending the International Conference on Easing Tensions held a press conference on the 22nd, with reporters from Swedish and other countries' newspapers in attendance.

Fukushima, the chief delegate of the Japanese delegation and a member of the Science Council of Japan, said that the forty Japanese delegates attending the conference represented Japan's major political parties, as well as commercial, cultural, and religious circles.

Fukushima emphasized that the significance of the conference lay in the fact that representatives of countries with different social systems had gathered together, and they could freely exchange views on international issues.

When discussing the work of the conference's various groups, he said that the issues of banning atomic weapons, Korea, and Indochina were the main issues discussed by the political group.

The chief delegate of the Japanese delegation said that we are particularly interested in the work of the conference's economic group. Japan is particularly concerned about the establishment and expansion of free trade between East and West.

Fukushima said that the delegations from Japan, the People's Republic of China, and France attending the conference held consultations with each other to discuss the situation in Asia.

At the end of the press conference, he said that the delegations from India, the People's Republic of China, and Japan, in principle, approved the proposal to convene an All-Asia Representative Conference, at which, as at this conference, methods for easing tensions in Asia would be discussed.

    印日两国出席缓和局势国际会议的代表团
    分别招待记者说明对缓和紧张局势的意见
    据新华社讯：参加缓和局势国际会议的印度代表团在二十一日举行了一次记者招待会，招待瑞典和外国记者。
    印度代表团（团员十四人，其中六人是印度国会议员）在招待会上发表了一个声明，声明说：会议是在友好的气氛中进行的，所有的代表都不想谴责任何人，而只想达到相互的了解。我们深信这次会议必将获得成功。
    我们的代表团虽然是具有各种不同信仰的人组成的，但是在一些原则上却只有一个意见：
    第一、我们认为争端能够而且必须通过协商来解决。我们认为战争是一种强制的手段，必须予以禁止。
    第二、我们认为有着各种不同的政治和经济制度的国家是能够和平共处的。
    第三、我们认为每一国家必须享有充分的自由和独立的权利。决不允许任何国家以任何借口干涉其他国家的内政。
    接着，声明提出印度代表团的建议如下：
      （一）立即实现印度支那的停火，给予印度支那各国人民以不受法国政府干涉而获得自由的权利。
      （二）就朝鲜的持久和平取得协议，保证从朝鲜撤退外国军队，给予朝鲜人民决定他们自己前途的权利。
    （三）禁止各种类型的原子武器和热核子武器以及各种类型的大规模毁灭性武器。
      （四）逐步地和按比例地裁减军备，以便在可能时达到完全的裁减军备。
      （五）恢复四大国之间关于和平解决德国问题的谈判，这种解决应保证建立一个统一的、完全独立的、有选择任何政治和经济制度的自由的德国。
    （六）发展各国之间的密切的文化和经济关系，消除目前存在的各种障碍和禁令。
    （七）中华人民共和国参加联合国工作，正如我们的总理所说，没有中华人民共和国参加联合国工作，亚洲或世界上的问题都不能得到解决。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩二十三日讯：参加缓和局势国际会议的日本代表团二十二日举行有瑞典及其他国家报纸记者参加的记者招待会。
    日本代表团首席代表、日本学术会议会员福岛说，参加会议的有四十个日本代表，他们代表日本的各大政党以及商业、文化和宗教各界。
    福岛强调说，会议的意义在于：各种社会制度不同的国家的代表都聚集在一堂了，他们可以自由地就国际问题交换意见。
    在谈到会议各小组的工作时，他说，禁止原子武器问题、朝鲜问题和印度支那问题，是政治小组所讨论的主要问题。
    日本代表团首席代表说，我们对会议经济小组的工作特别感到兴趣。日本特别关心东西方自由贸易的建立和扩大。
    福岛说，出席会议的日本、中华人民共和国和法国的代表团相互间举行了商谈，讨论了亚洲的局势。
    在招待会要结束时，他说，印度、中华人民共和国和日本的代表团原则上赞成关于召开全亚代表会议的建议，在全亚代表会议上也同在这次会议上一样，将讨论缓和亚洲紧张局势的办法。
