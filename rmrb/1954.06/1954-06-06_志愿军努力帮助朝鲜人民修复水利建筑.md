Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 5th: Many units of the Chinese People's Volunteers are vigorously helping the Korean people to build water conservancy projects.

	There are many rivers in the plains along the west coast of Korea. Some of the original water conservancy structures were destroyed by the enemy during the war, and some have been in disrepair for a long time. In order to save the people from floods and expand the irrigated area, the Korean Cabinet and the water conservancy departments of South Pyongan Province and North Pyongan Province have formulated plans to restore the water conservancy structures in this area, mobilizing the people to actively build them. The CPV units stationed on the west coast have taken the initiative to participate in the local water conservancy construction projects. In May alone, they contributed more than 400,000 workdays, and worked enthusiastically with the Korean people on more than 80 construction sites in 12 counties. Most of these projects have now been completed. The 9,300-meter-long Aishan River flood control levee in Sukchon County has been repaired. The Daegyo River diversion project carried out by a certain CPV unit to help the people of Anju County and Mundok County in South Pyongan Province has also been completed. After the Daegyo River changes its course, not only will 1.5 million "pyong" of paddy fields no longer be flooded, but it will also be possible to expand the cultivated area by 30,000 "pyong". In order to commemorate the contributions of the CPV units participating in this project, the Anju County and Mundok County People's Committees erected a monument on the banks of the Daegyo River, inscribed in both Chinese and Korean: "The friendship between the Korean and Chinese people forged with blood and sweat will last forever."

	Since the beginning of spring, a certain CPV unit stationed in the Kimhwa area has helped the local people build a total of more than 17,500 meters of canals, and also built three dams and a large reservoir, which can irrigate 614,650 "pyong" of local farmland. A certain CPV unit in the Pyonggang area, while helping the Korean people returning to their hometowns to settle down, also actively helped to repair the water conservancy structures destroyed by the enemy during the war, and also built some new canals.

	The vast number of CPV cadres and soldiers have generally shown a high degree of enthusiasm for labor in helping the Korean people build water conservancy structures. In the Daegyo River diversion project, a group of recoilless gunners from a certain unit increased the amount of earth dug per person per day from 4.3 cubic meters to 17.4 cubic meters. A squad from a certain unit that won a special merit award dug 272.7 cubic meters of earth in 13 hours, completing the work originally scheduled to be completed in seven days ahead of schedule. Many CPV units stationed on the Pyonggang front built simple tents on the construction site for camping in order to save time during the project. The soldiers also went to the mountains to cut tree branches and weave baskets, etc., to overcome the difficulty of insufficient soil transportation tools in time.

    志愿军努力帮助朝鲜人民修复水利建筑
    【新华社平壤五日电】中国人民志愿军许多部队正在大力帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利。
    朝鲜西海岸一带平原上，江河很多，原来的水利建筑有的在战争中被敌人破坏了，有的日久失修。为了使人民免遭水灾和扩大灌溉面积，朝鲜内阁和平安南道、平安北道的水利部门都制订了恢复这一带水利建筑的计划，动员人民积极兴修。志愿军驻西海岸各部队都主动参加了当地的水利建设工程，仅五月份就出了四十多万个工，在十二个郡的八十多处建筑工地上和朝鲜人民一道展开了热情的劳动。这些工程目前已大部完工。肃川郡境内长达九千三百多公尺的艾山江防洪水堤已经修好。志愿军某部帮助平安南道安州郡和文德郡人民进行的大桥川改道工程也已完工。大桥川改变河道后，不但使一百五十万坪稻田不再遭受水淹，并且能扩大耕地面积三万坪。为了纪念参加这一工程的志愿军部队的功绩，安州郡、文德郡人民委员会在大桥川畔立了一座纪念碑，碑上用中朝两国文字写着“朝中人民用血汗结成的友谊永远长存”。
    驻在金城地区的志愿军某部，入春以来帮助驻地人民修筑的水渠共长一万七千五百多公尺，另外还修筑了三条挡水坝和一个大贮水池，可以使当地六十一万四千六百五十坪田地得到灌溉。平康地区的志愿军某部在帮助回乡的朝鲜人民安家时，也积极帮助修复在战时被敌人破坏的水利建筑，并且还增修了一些新的水渠。
    志愿军广大干部、战士，在帮助朝鲜人民兴修水利建筑时，普遍表现了高度的劳动热忱。在大桥川改河道的工程中，某部无座力炮连的一个小组每人每天挖土由四点三立方公尺增加到十七点四立方公尺，某部荣立特等功的一个班在十三小时中，挖土二百七十二点七立方公尺，提前完成了原定七天完成的工作任务。志愿军驻在平康前线的许多部队在工程中为了节省时间，在工地上搭起了简单的帐篷露营。战士们还到山上割树条编成筐子等，及时克服了运土工具不足的困难。
