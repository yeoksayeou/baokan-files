Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 9th: The Geneva Conference continued its plenary session on the Indochina issue at 3:00 PM today. Soviet delegation chief representative Molotov chaired the meeting.

    Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, delivered an important speech at today's meeting (full text to be published separately). Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai reviewed the previous discussions, especially those since May 27th, pointed out the common ground of the opinions of all parties and the main differences at present, criticized various incorrect opinions, and explained in detail the Chinese delegation's position on the disputed issues, pointing out the way to resolve differences. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai supported the proposal made by Acting Foreign Minister Pham Van Dong and Foreign Minister Molotov on June 8th to discuss political settlement issues while discussing military armistice issues.

    Before Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's speech, Bao Dai Vietnam's representative Nguyen Quoc Dinh and the Kingdom of Laos' representative spoke. In his lengthy and lackluster speech, Nguyen Quoc Dinh once again expressed the Bao Dai group's fear of restoring peace in Indochina. Nguyen Quoc Dinh opposed the principle of adjusting zones proposed by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is necessary to achieve a stable armistice. He stubbornly argued that this would hinder Vietnam's "unification." However, everyone knows that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently advocated for the realization of peace, independence, unification, and democracy in Vietnam. Nguyen Quoc Dinh used "unification" as an excuse to oppose the principle of adjusting zones, which is necessary to achieve a stable armistice, with the aim of hindering the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina.

    Nguyen Quoc Dinh opposed any truly neutral country monitoring the armistice. He echoed the United States' view, advocating for the United Nations to monitor the armistice. In fact, the Geneva Conference has nothing to do with the United Nations. Moreover, the United States is currently attempting to use the United Nations as a banner to expand the Indochina War. Therefore, putting forward such a proposition will only complicate the work of the conference and hinder its progress.

    The speech by the representative of the Kingdom of Laos, Phouang Sananikone, was full of slanders against the Laotian Resistance Government. Like the representative of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the representative of the Kingdom of Laos also attempted to use the withdrawal of the (in reality non-existent) Vietnamese People's Army as an excuse to eliminate the Laotian resistance forces and the Laotian national liberation movement. The representative of the Kingdom of Laos proposed that Pakistan, Thailand, India, Ceylon, and the Philippines monitor the armistice, but even he himself lacked confidence in whether these five countries would be accepted.

    U.S. representative Smith also spoke at the meeting. Smith attempted to downplay the constructive significance of the speeches by Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, apparently because these speeches made it more difficult for the United States to obstruct the progress of the conference. Smith then attempted to defend the United States' aggressive policy in Asia.

    Smith completely avoided mentioning the point that the conference should simultaneously discuss the political issues of Indochina. He also did not offer any constructive suggestions. He merely continued to insist on those propositions that have been hindering the progress of the conference, demanding that the issues of Cambodia and Laos be dealt with individually, and demanding that the resistance forces of these two countries withdraw from their own countries. He echoed the views of Britain and the Bao Dai government, believing that international supervision should be the responsibility of the five countries participating in the Colombo Conference or the United Nations. Smith's speech showed that the United States' policy of obstructing the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement has not changed.

    After Smith finished speaking, the chairman announced that the ninth meeting was adjourned. According to the agreement, a plenary session will continue on the 10th. The meeting adjourned at 7:15 PM.

    日内瓦会议九日继续讨论印度支那问题
    周外长指出解决分歧的道路
    并支持越、苏两国外长关于立即讨论政治问题的主张
    据新华社日内瓦九日电：日内瓦会议九日下午三时继续举行讨论印度支那问题的全体会议。苏联代表团首席代表莫洛托夫任主席。
    中华人民共和国周恩来外长在今日的会议上作了重要发言（全文另发）。周恩来外长回顾了历次讨论，特别是五月二十七日以来的讨论，指出了各方意见的共同点和目前的主要分歧，批判了各种不正确的意见，并详尽地阐明了中国代表团对各项争论中的问题的立场，指出了解决分歧的道路。周恩来外长支持范文同代理外长和莫洛托夫外长在六月八日提出的关于在讨论军事停战问题同时讨论政治解决问题的主张。
    在周恩来外长之前发言的有保大越南代表阮国定和寮国王国代表。阮国定在他的冗长而又内容贫乏的发言中又一次表示保大集团害怕在印度支那恢复和平。阮国定反对越南民主共和国代表团所提出的为达成稳定停战所必需的调整区域原则。他硬说，这就会妨碍越南的“统一”。然而，谁都知道，越南民主共和国一贯主张实现越南的和平、独立、统一和民主。阮国定以“统一”为借口来反对为达成稳定停战所必需的调整区域原则，其目的就是要阻挠日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平方面达成协议。
    阮国定反对由任何真正的中立国家来监察停战。他附和美国的见解，主张由联合国来监察停战。事实上，日内瓦会议与联合国完全无关。而且，美国目前正企图利用联合国的招牌来扩大印度支那战争。因此，提出这样的主张只会使会议的工作复杂化，并阻挠会议的进展。
    寮国王国代表冯·萨纳尼空的发言充满了对寮国抗战政府的诬蔑。和高棉王国代表一样，寮国王国代表也企图以撤退事实上并不存在的越南人民军为借口，来达到消灭寮国抗战军队和寮国民族解放运动的目的。寮国王国代表提出由巴基斯坦、泰国、印度、锡兰、菲律宾五国来监察停战，但是连他自己也对这五国是否被接受缺乏信心。
    美国代表史密斯也在会上发言。史密斯企图抹煞莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长发言的建设性的意义，显然是因为这些发言使美国阻挠会议的进展更为困难了。史密斯接着就企图为美国在亚洲的侵略政策辩护。
    史密斯完全避而不谈会议应该同时讨论印度支那的政治问题这一点。他也没有提出任何建设性的意见。他只是继续坚持那些一直阻挠会议进展的主张，要求将高棉与寮国的问题个别处理，并要求这两国的抵抗军队撤出它们的本国。他附和英国和保大政府的意见，认为国际监察应该由参加科伦坡会议的五国或联合国来负责。史密斯的发言表明，美国阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议的政策并没有改变。
    史密斯发言完毕后，主席宣布九日会议至此结束。根据协议，十日继续举行全体会议。会议于下午七时十五分休会。
