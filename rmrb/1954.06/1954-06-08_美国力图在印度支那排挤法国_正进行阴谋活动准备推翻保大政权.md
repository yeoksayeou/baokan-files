　　Xinhua News Agency, June 7th: TASS, Paris, June 6th: "Nation Forum" weekly published an article saying that the United States Embassy in Saigon is relying on prominent Vietnamese political activists to prepare, if necessary, to overthrow Bao Dai and form a government that dares to sever the final ties with the French Federation. The United States Embassy in Saigon hopes to rely on this new government, which dares to completely sever relations with France, to unite all nationalist parties to actively fight against the Viet Minh (referring to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam - TASS editor).

　　U.S. Ambassador Donald Heath personally participated in planning and formulating this plan, and he is currently in Geneva. This plan has also been approved by the highest U.S. military and political organs. The Americans intend to have Nguyen Huu Tri, the "Chairman" of North Vietnam, serve as the head of state. The "Dai Viet" party and the Ngo Dinh Diem group will play an important role in the new government. At the same time, Prince Buu Loc, who is currently serving as Prime Minister of Bao Dai's Vietnam, may also be appointed to an important government position. It can be seen that the American planners of this plan are trying to kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, to replace France's influence in Indochina; on the other hand, to make the struggle of Vietnamese nationalists against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam even more rampant.

    美国力图在印度支那排挤法国
    正进行阴谋活动准备推翻保大政权
    【新华社七日讯】　塔斯社巴黎六日讯：“民族论坛”周刊登载的一篇文章说，美国驻西贡大使馆正依靠越南的著名政治活动家，准备在万一必要的时候，推翻保大，组成一个敢于和法兰西联邦断绝最后联系的政府。美国驻西贡大使馆指望依靠这个敢于和法国完全断绝关系的新政府以联合一切民族主义者的党派来积极进行反对越盟（即指越南民主共和国——塔斯社编者）的斗争。
    美国大使唐纳德·海斯亲自参加了策划和拟制这个计划的工作，他目前在日内瓦。这个计划并已得到美国最高军事和政治机关的赞同。美国人打算叫北越“主席”阮友智担任国家的首领。“大越”党和吴庭艳集团将在新政府里起重要的作用。同时，现在担任保大越南总理的宝禄亲王也可能被任命担任政府的重要职务。由此可见，这个计划的美国策划者是企图一箭双雕的：一方面取代法国在印度支那的势力；另一方面，使越南民族主义分子反对越南民主共和国的斗争更加猖獗。
