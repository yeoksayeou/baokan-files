    Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, visited India and arrived in New Delhi on the 25th of this month. This is a great joyous event for the people of China and India; it is of great significance for promoting the friendly relations between China and India and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

    China and India have a population of nearly one billion, are adjacent to each other, and are both major Asian countries with the longest cultural history. The people of our two countries love peace, and we have never had a war with each other. For thousands of years, the people of the two countries have had close economic and cultural relations and profound friendship. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between China and India have developed on a new basis. The two countries have not only established friendly diplomatic relations, but also developed economic and cultural exchanges. The exchanges between the people of the two countries have become increasingly frequent, and the mutual ties have become closer.

    The Chinese government and people have always cherished and valued the friendly unity of the people of China and India. Chairman Mao Zedong said in his congratulatory message at the Indian National Day celebration in 1951: "The Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are very good people. The friendship between the two nations and the two peoples of China and India has been very good for thousands of years. ... We hope that the two nations of China and India will continue to unite and strive for peace. People all over the world need peace, and only a few people want war. India, China, the Soviet Union, and all other peace-loving countries and people unite and strive for peace in the Far East and peace in the whole world."

    The friendly relations between China and India are particularly manifested in the agreement signed between the two countries in April 1954 regarding trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his congratulatory telegram to Prime Minister Nehru after the signing of this agreement: "This agreement, concluded by China and India on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, re-establishes the relations between the two countries in the Tibet region of China on a new basis. The signing of this agreement will not only further strengthen the friendship between the people of China and India, but also fully proves that as long as all countries jointly abide by the above-mentioned principles and adopt a consultative approach, any existing problems between countries can be reasonably resolved." Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out in his reply telegram: "This agreement, concluded on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, strengthens and consolidates the friendship between the people of China and India." Obviously, these principles are the foundation for peaceful coexistence and the enhancement of friendly relations between countries. The continuous improvement of friendly relations between China and India on this basis is conducive to the peaceful development and prosperity of the two countries, and is in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of the two countries.

    China and India are both concerned about peace in Asia and the world. This is first demonstrated in the attitude of the two countries towards the Korean issue. Our country has made great efforts to promote the realization of the Korean armistice, and has continued to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. India has also made important contributions to the realization of the Korean armistice and has presided over the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea. Now, although the negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference have been disrupted due to the refusal of the United States to negotiate, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has not been erased from the agenda of international affairs, and countries related to the Korean issue will continue to work to seek a thorough solution to the Korean issue and establish an independent, democratic, and unified Korea. Similarly, in the struggle to restore peace in Indochina, our country, together with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving forces, has worked together at the Geneva Conference and has achieved two agreements, namely, the agreement to promote the early and simultaneous cessation of hostilities throughout Indochina and the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Cambodia and Laos." Indian Prime Minister Nehru's several statements on the Indochina issue in the People's House of the Indian Parliament before and after the Geneva Conference also expressed close concern for the restoration of peace in Indochina. During the Geneva Conference, Indian diplomat Menon also made many efforts in Geneva to restore peace in Indochina. All of these, as well as other activities of the people and governments of China and India in international affairs, clearly have a significant role in promoting peace in Asia and the world.

    At present, the aggressive forces of the United States harbor ever greater ambitions towards Asia. It is trying its best to establish aggressive alliances in Asia, dividing Asia into opposing blocs in order to facilitate its aggression and control of Asia and create wars here. The peace of Asia and the security of the people of Asian countries are facing major threats. The common desire of the people of Asian countries today is to do their best to safeguard peace and security in Asia. For this noble purpose, China and India shoulder a solemn responsibility. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai has repeatedly pointed out in his speeches at the Geneva Conference:

	"Asian countries should consult with each other and work together to maintain peace and security in Asia by mutually undertaking corresponding obligations." And he believes that: "Asian countries should respect each other's independence and sovereignty without interfering in each other's internal affairs; should resolve disputes between countries through peaceful consultation without using force or threats; should establish and develop normal economic and cultural relations between countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit without allowing discrimination and restrictions." In his foreign policy speech in the Indian People's House on May 15, Indian Prime Minister Nehru continued to praise the agreement signed between China and India regarding trade and communication between the Tibet region of China and India, saying: "I sincerely hope that this zone of peace can be expanded to the rest of Asia, and even to the rest of the world." Jointly maintaining peace and security in Asia is of great concern to the people of China and India, and is also an urgent need for all the people of Asian countries. The sincere unity of Asian countries can guarantee this need and, at the same time, promote peace throughout the world.

    The Chinese people are very happy to have India as a great neighbor dedicated to peace. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India will express the Chinese people's deep feelings for the Indian people. The relationship between China and India has provided a good example of friendly relations between Asian countries. There is no doubt that the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India in New Delhi will further enhance understanding between the two countries and further strengthen cooperation between China and India in international affairs. The development and consolidation of the traditional friendship of nearly one billion people in China and India will greatly help to ensure peace in Asia and the world.

### 中印两国团结起来，为远东和世界的和平而努力

    中印两国团结起来，为远东和世界的和平而努力
    我国中央人民政府政务院总理周恩来应印度共和国总理尼赫鲁的邀请，访问印度，已于本月二十五日到达新德里。这是中印两国人民的一件大喜事；这对于促进中印两国的友好关系和巩固亚洲及世界的和平有着重大的意义。
    中印两国拥有近十亿的人口，国境毗连，都是文化历史最悠久的亚洲大国。我们两国人民都热爱和平，我们相互之间从来没有发生过战争。几千年来两国人民在经济上和文化上一直是有密切的关系和深远的友谊的。从中华人民共和国建国时起，中印两国之间的友好关系，在一个新的基础上发展起来。两国不但建立了友好的外交关系，并且发展了两国的经济和文化交流，两国人民之间的往来日益频繁，相互的联系也更加亲密了。
    我国政府和人民一贯地珍贵和重视中印两国人民的友好团结。毛泽东主席在一九五一年印度国庆庆祝会上的祝词说：“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民。中国、印度这两个民族和两国人民之间的友谊，几千年以来是很好的。……我们希望中国和印度两个民族继续团结起来，为和平而努力。全世界人民都需要和平，只有少数人要战争。印度、中国、苏联及其他一切爱好和平的国家和人民团结起来，为远东和平、为全世界的和平而努力。”
    中印两国的友好关系，特别表现在一九五四年四月间两国所签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通的协定中。我国周恩来总理在这个协定签订以后致尼赫鲁总理的贺电中曾指出：“中印两国基于互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则而缔结的这个协定，使两国在中国西藏地方的关系在新的基础上重新建立起来。这一协定的签订不仅将进一步加强中印两国人民之间的友谊，并且充分证明只要各国共同遵守上述各项原则，采取协商方式，国际间存在着的任何问题均可获得合理解决。”尼赫鲁总理在复电中也指出：“此一基于互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互惠、和平共处的原则而缔结的协定，加强并巩固了中印两国人民的友谊。”显然，这些原则是各国间和平相处，增进友好关系的基础。中印两国在这个基础之上不断增进的友好关系，是有利于两国的和平发展和繁荣，符合于两国人民的利益和愿望的。
    中印两国都关心亚洲和全世界的和平。这首先在两国对于朝鲜问题的态度上得到证明。我国为促成朝鲜停战的实现作了重大的努力，并在日内瓦会议中继续为和平解决朝鲜问题而坚持奋斗。印度对朝鲜停战的实现也曾作了重要的贡献，并主持了在朝鲜的中立国遣返委员会的工作。现在，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判虽然由于美国拒绝协商而遭到破坏，但是和平解决朝鲜问题并没有从国际事务的议程上抹掉，与朝鲜问题有关的国家将继续为谋求朝鲜问题的彻底解决和建立一个独立、民主、统一的朝鲜而努力。同样，在为恢复印度支那和平而进行的斗争中，我国在日内瓦会议上与越南民主共和国、苏联以及一切爱好和平的力量共同努力，已取得了两项协议，即促使在印度支那全境敌对行动的早日和同时终止的协议和“关于在柬埔寨和老挝停止敌对行动的协议。”印度总理尼赫鲁在日内瓦会议召开前后，就印度支那问题在印度国会人民院所发表的几次声明，也表示了对恢复印度支那和平的密切关怀。在日内瓦会议期间，印度外交家梅农也在日内瓦关于恢复印度支那和平作了很多努力。所有这些，以及中印两国人民和政府在国际事务中的其他活动，对于促进亚洲和全世界和平显然都具有重大的作用。
    目前，美国的侵略势力对亚洲抱着越来越大的野心。它极力想在亚洲建立侵略性的联盟，把亚洲分裂成为对立的集团，以便于它侵略和控制亚洲，并在这里制造战争。亚洲的和平和亚洲各国人民的安全正受到重大的威胁。亚洲各国人民当前的共同愿望，就是尽力维护亚洲的和平和安全。为了这个崇高的目的，中印两国承担着庄严的责任。我国周恩来总理在日内瓦会议上的发言中，曾一再指出：
  “亚洲国家彼此之间应该进行协商，以互相承担相应的义务的方法，共同努力维护亚洲的和平和安全。”并认为：“亚洲国家应该互相尊重各国的独立和主权，而不互相干涉内政；应该以和平协商方法解决各国之间的争端，而不使用武力和威胁；应该在平等互利的基础上建立和发展各国之间的正常的经济和文化关系，而不容许歧视和限制。”印度总理尼赫鲁五月十五日在印度人民院发表的外交演说中，继续称赞中印两国签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定之后说：“我诚恳地希望这一个和平区域能够扩大到亚洲的其余部分，甚至扩大到世界的其余部分。”共同维护亚洲的和平和安全，是中印两国人民所极为关心的，也是亚洲各国全体人民的迫切需要。而亚洲各国的真诚团结就能够使这种需要得到保证，同时，也就能够促进全世界的和平。
    中国人民很高兴有印度这样致力于和平的伟大邻邦。周恩来总理这次访问印度，将表达中国人民对印度人民的亲切感情。中印两国之间的关系，已为亚洲国家之间的友好关系提供了良好的范例。毫无疑问，中印两国总理在新德里的会晤，将进一步增进两国之间的了解，进一步加强中印两国在国际事务中的合作。中印两国将近十万万人民的传统友谊的发展和巩固，将大大有助于保障亚洲及全世界的和平。
