Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently held a plenary session to discuss this year's spring planting work, crop field management work, preparation for harvest, and ensuring the completion of the 1954 agricultural product procurement and purchase plan. The meeting also adopted a resolution on these issues.

The resolution pointed out that the measures being implemented by the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union to further rapidly develop all sectors of socialist agriculture and increase the production of consumer goods have been endorsed by the people of the whole country and have set off a tremendous labor upsurge among workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals. In recent times, the Party and the government have adopted a series of new measures aimed at further enhancing the material interests of collective farms and collective farm members in increasing agricultural production. These measures have enabled collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms to conduct this year's spring sowing work in a more organized manner and to improve agricultural work. This spring, the sowing time of grain crops was shortened, and the level of work was improved. Square cluster planting was widely used for the first time in sowing cultivated crops. Mineral and local fertilizers were better utilized.

This spring, collective farms and state farms overfulfilled the state plan for sowing spring crops, sowing 9.5 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) more than in 1953. Compared with 1953, the sown area of spring grain crops was expanded by 6,429,000 hectares; the sown area of cotton was expanded by 354,000 hectares; and the sown areas of sugar beets, sunflowers, vegetables, feed, and silage crops were also expanded compared with last year. The work of machine tractor stations has been further improved. The amount of work done by tractors in the fields of collective farms, calculated as plowing, increased by 18,674,000 hectares compared with last year, and the quality of work was also improved. These achievements demonstrate the enormous potential of socialist agriculture in expanding the sown area of crops and increasing the yield per unit area of crops.

The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out that the work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land this year has become a national undertaking, which has been enthusiastically supported by collective farm members, workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, and urban residents. More than 140,000 people have responded to the call of the Party and the government to actively participate in the reclamation work in machine tractor stations and state farms. Collective farms and state farms have now overfulfilled the state-stipulated task of sowing grain crops on newly reclaimed land this spring. 3.6 million hectares of newly reclaimed land have been sown with grain crops, while the original plan stipulated that only 2.3 million hectares should be sown. The work of reclaiming virgin land for sowing crops next year is progressing smoothly. This spring, 124 new state grain farms with a total cultivated area of 2,532,000 hectares have been established in the reclamation areas. The machine tractor stations and state farms reclaiming wasteland have received 50,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 6,300 trucks, and many other machines, equipment, and materials. 400 million rubles have been allocated to build residential and production houses for the new state grain farms, and prefabricated houses with an area of 250,000 square meters have been supplied.

The resolution then pointed out some shortcomings of various agencies and organizations in spring sowing work, reclamation work, the establishment of new state farms, the supply of necessary equipment to agriculture, and the organizational and economic consolidation of collective farms. The resolution charged the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, the Soviet Ministry of State Farms, and local Party, government, and agricultural organs to eliminate these shortcomings in the leadership of agricultural work, unite the collective farm members and the workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, and mobilize them to ensure a significant increase in the yield per unit area of crops, increase the total output of grain and other crops and the output of livestock products, ensure the timely and good field management of crops, conduct the harvesting work in an organized and lossless manner, and complete the national plan for the requisition and purchase of agricultural products in a timely manner.

The resolution then stipulated specific measures for carrying out crop field management work and for preparing and carrying out harvesting work. The resolution charged the central and local agricultural organs and mass organizations to concentrate the strength of agronomists to carry out field management work. In carrying out this work, all localities should strictly abide by the agricultural technology standards formulated according to local conditions, and regard the full implementation of field management work as the most important condition for striving for a bumper harvest of crops this year. In terms of preparing for and carrying out harvesting work, the resolution pointed out that Soviet agriculture has first-rate technical equipment, which enables the main harvesting work, especially the harvesting of grains, to be mechanized. During this year's harvest, machine tractor stations and state farms will receive more than 350,000 combines, about 33,000 flax threshers and flax harvesting combines, 11,000 sugar beet harvesting combines, more than 24,000 cotton pickers, about 10,000 potato harvesting combines, and a large number of grain cleaning machines and other machines and equipment. Now, machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms have skilled workers and experts as well as experienced agricultural machine operators, which ensures that the existing equipment can be fully utilized.

The resolution then pointed out some shortcomings in the work of preparing for the harvest and stipulated ways to eliminate these shortcomings, as well as the specific tasks of the departments and organizations concerned in preparing for and carrying out the crop harvest work.

The resolution also stipulated the necessary measures for preparing for the sowing of winter crops, which is of great importance for the development of grain production, especially for increasing the production of edible grains.

The resolution also stipulated measures to ensure the completion of the 1954 national plan for the requisition and purchase of agricultural products, as well as the harvesting and storage of feed and the preparation of livestock for wintering.

    苏联共产党中央委员会举行全体会议
    就今年春播工作等问题通过决议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会最近举行的全体会议，讨论了今年的春播工作、作物的田间管理工作、准备收获和保证完成一九五四年农产品的收购和征购计划等问题。会议并就这些问题通过了一项决议。
    决议指出，苏联共产党和政府正在实行的进一步迅速发展社会主义农业各部门和增加消费品生产的措施，已经得到了全国人民的拥护，并在工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子中间掀起了巨大的劳动高潮。在最近时期中，党和政府又采取了一系列旨在进一步提高集体农庄和集体农庄庄员在增加农产品产量中的物质利益的新措施。这些措施使得集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场能够更有组织地进行今年的春季播种工作，并改进农业工作。今年春季，谷物的播种时间缩短了，工作水平提高了。在播种中耕作物时，第一次广泛地使用了正方穴播法。矿质肥料和地方肥料得到了更好的利用。
    今年春季，集体农庄和国营农场超额完成了播种春播作物的国家计划，比一九五三年多播种了九百五十万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）。和一九五三年比较，春播谷物的播种面积扩大了六百四十二万九千公顷；棉花的播种面积扩大了三十五万四千公顷；甜菜、向日葵、蔬菜、饲料和青储饲料作物的播种面积也比去年扩大了。机器拖拉机站的工作有了进一步的改进。拖拉机在集体农庄田间所做的工作量，如折合成犁地计算，比去年增加了一千八百六十七万四千公顷，工作的质量也提高了。这些成绩证明，社会主义农业在扩大农作物播种面积和提高农作物单位面积产量方面有着何等巨大的潜力。
    苏共中央全会指出，今年开垦生荒地和热荒地的工作已成了全民的事业，它得到了集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场工人以及城市居民的热烈支持。已经有十四万多人响应党和政府的号召，到机器拖拉机站和国营农场积极参加开垦工作。集体农庄和国营农场现在已经超额完成了国家所规定的今年春季在新垦地上播种谷物的任务。有三百六十万公顷的新垦地已播种了谷物，而原计划规定只播种二百三十万公顷。为明年播种作物而开垦生荒地的工作正在顺利进行中。今年春季，在开垦地区已成立了耕地面积共达二百五十三万二千公顷的
  一百二十四个新的国营谷物农场。开垦荒地的机器拖拉机站和国营农场已得到了五万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、六千三百辆卡车以及其他许多机器、设备和物资。已拨出了四亿卢布来为新的国营谷物农场建筑住宅和作生产用的房屋，并供应了面积共达二十五万平方公尺的预装配房屋。
    决议接着指出了各机关和组织在春播工作、开垦工作、建立新的国营农场、供给农业以必要的设备以及在组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄等工作中的一些缺点。决议责成苏联农业部、苏联国营农场部、地方党、政府和农业机关消灭农业领导工作中的这些缺点，团结集体农庄庄员和机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人，动员他们来保证大大提高农作物的单位面积产量，增加谷物和其他作物的总产量以及畜产品的产量，保证及时和很好地进行农作物的田间管理工作，有组织地、无损失地进行收获工作，及时完成征购和收购农产品的国家计划。
    决议接着规定了进行农作物田间管理工作以及准备和进行收获工作的具体措施。决议责成中央和地方农业机关及群众团体集中农学家的力量进行田间管理工作。在进行这一工作时，各地应严格遵守根据当地条件制订的农业技术标准，把充分进行田间管理工作当作争取今年农作物丰收的最重要的条件。在准备和进行收获工作方面，决议指出，苏联农业有着头等的技术装备，使得主要的收获工作、首先是谷物的收获工作能够机械化。在今年收获期间，机器拖拉机站和国营农场将得到三十五万台以上的收割联合机，约三万三千台亚麻脱粒机和亚麻收割联合机，一万一千台甜菜收获联合机，二万四千多台摘棉机，约一万台马铃薯收获联合机和大量清谷机及其他机器与装备。现在，机器拖拉机站，国营农场和集体农庄有了熟练的工作人员和专家以及有经验的农业机器操使者，这就保证了现有的设备能够得到充分的利用。
    决议接着指出了准备收获的工作中的若干缺点，并规定了消灭这些缺点的办法，以及各有关部门和组织在准备和进行农作物收获工作方面的具体任务。
    决议还规定了准备播种冬播作物的工作的必要措施，这对发展谷物生产、特别是对增加食用谷物的生产有着非常重要的意义。
    决议还规定了保证完成一九五四年国家的农产品征购和收购计划以及收割和储存饲料及准备牲畜过冬等方面的措施。
