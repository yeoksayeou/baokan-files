Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 1st: The delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a press conference on May 31st for journalists covering the Geneva Conference.

Huang Van Hoan, spokesperson for the delegation, issued a statement regarding the completion of the evacuation of seriously wounded officers and soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force from Dien Bien Phu, which took place from May 13th to 26th.

Huang Van Hoan pointed out that during this period, a total of 858 seriously wounded prisoners of war were handed over to the French authorities. He said that some time ago, some people insisted that the Vietnamese side wanted to take the opportunity of evacuating the wounded to demand that France cease its aerial attacks on Highway 41 in order to gain a strategic advantage. The fact is that the suggestion to stop bombing that highway was made by Professor Huard, representative of the General Headquarters of the French Forces in Indochina, on May 13th, and agreed to by the Vietnamese side. Therefore, the demand to stop the bombing did not come from the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Huang Van Hoan continued, saying that some people also insisted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam practiced racial and ethnic discrimination regarding wounded soldiers who were eligible for repatriation. The facts show that this statement is untrue. The 858 evacuated wounded soldiers included soldiers of 21 nationalities, including 84 Vietnamese.

Some people also insisted that the Vietnamese side deliberately obstructed the evacuation work. The facts show that it was the French authorities who violated their earlier agreements and put forward General Navarre's six-point proposal, some of which were unacceptable, and others required difficult negotiations, the outcome of which was difficult to say. All of these delayed the evacuation work. However, the Vietnamese side still allowed the evacuation work to continue, even though the French authorities unilaterally violated the May 13th agreement and resumed the bombing of Highway 41 and the areas surrounding Dien Bien Phu.

Huang Van Hoan then pointed out that French experts also admitted that it was not appropriate to repair the runway for Dakota-type aircraft to land – which the French side insisted on at the beginning. The quickest way to evacuate was actually by using helicopters.

Huang Van Hoan said that it was said in Geneva that the negotiations in the area – Vietnam – encountered great difficulties. But, in fact, the negotiations between the two sides' command posts in the area progressed smoothly until the French side violated the May 13th agreement and, at the instigation of people outside Indochina, put forward absurd conditions. Huang Van Hoan emphasized that all of this is found in the joint report signed on May 27th by Cao Van Khanh, representative of the delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, and Professor Huard, representative of the General Headquarters of the French Expeditionary Force.

Huang Van Hoan used the latter part of the press conference to explain the issues currently being discussed at the Geneva Conference, which have been distorted in recent days.

He first talked about the interrelationship between the political and military measures included in the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on establishing peace in Indochina. He explained the position of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this issue as follows:

“The ceasefire is a very important issue. A ceasefire must be achieved before political measures are taken. Item 8 of the proposal we put forward at the meeting on May 10th states very clearly: Before implementing the various measures stipulated in Items 1 to 7 of the proposal, that is: implementing measures regarding the recognition of the independence of the three Indochinese states, the withdrawal of foreign troops, the holding of free general elections, and participation in the French Union, etc., military actions must be stopped first, because we believe that without a ceasefire, the above measures cannot be implemented.

But, it would be a distortion of the issue if one were to conclude from this that the ceasefire and political measures have no relationship. The purpose of the ceasefire is to establish lasting peace, and lasting peace must be based on the recognition of the basic rights of the people of the three Indochinese states, and on the friendship between the people of the three Indochinese states and the French people.

In the past few days, the Geneva Conference has been discussing military issues. As you all know, the initial results have already been announced in the communique of the restricted meeting on May 29th. The meeting will turn to the discussion of political issues, because it is clear that in restoring peace in Indochina, political and military issues are inseparable."

Huang Van Hoan then talked about the issue of determining the regrouping areas for the troops of the belligerent parties.

Huang Van Hoan said: "Our proposal at the Geneva Conference includes this issue. Some people insist that we are suggesting the partition of the territory of our motherland by making such a proposal.

I ask: What should we do to ensure a ceasefire in Indochina? How can a ceasefire be achieved if the troops of the belligerent parties are not separated in the areas they each occupy?

From this, it can be seen that those who oppose the determination of regrouping areas in order to separate the troops of both sides do not want a ceasefire.

We were, are, and will continue to be resolute and unwavering fighters for the independence and unity of our motherland. We propose the division of regrouping areas because we know that this is the only way to achieve a ceasefire, and without a ceasefire, peace is impossible.

We believe that the division of regrouping areas – which is a necessary condition for achieving a ceasefire – is only a temporary measure, which will pave the way for holding free and democratic elections to establish the territorial and political unity of the country.

This attempt to make people believe that we advocate the partition of the territory of our country is, of course, untenable in the face of the facts.”

### 越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会  就撤运奠边府法军伤俘及印度支那问题的讨论发表声明

    越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会
    就撤运奠边府法军伤俘及印度支那问题的讨论发表声明
   【新华社日内瓦一日电】五月三十一日，越南民主共和国代表团举行记者招待会，招待采访日内瓦会议新闻的记者。
    代表团发言人黄文欢就五月十三日至二十六日自奠边府撤运法国远征军重伤官兵工作的完成发表声明。
    黄文欢指出，在这个时期内，共移交给法国当局八百五十八名重伤战俘。他说，在一些时候以前，有人硬说越南方面想借撤退伤俘的机会，要求法国停止对第四十一号公路的空中攻击，以在战略上获利。事实证明，要求停止轰炸那条公路的建议是印度支那法军总司令部代表胡尔教授在五月十三日提出，而由越南方面同意的。因此，要求停止轰炸的不是越南人民军总司令部。
    黄文欢继续说，还有人硬说，越南民主共和国对于有资格被遣返的伤员实行种族和民族的歧视。事实表明这种说法是不真实的。这八百五十八个被撤走的伤员包括二十一个国籍的士兵，其中有八十四个越南人。
    还有人硬说越南方面蓄意阻挠撤运工作。事实表明，是法国当局破坏了他们早先缔结的协议，提出了纳瓦尔将军的六点建议，其中有一些是不能接受的，另外一些需要举行困难的谈判，而其结果如何是很难说的。所有这些都耽误了撤运工作。但是，越南方面还是准许撤运工作继续进行，虽然法国当局片面地破坏了五月十三日的协议，恢复了对于第四十一号公路以及奠边府周围地区的轰炸。
    黄文欢接着指出，法国专家也承认，要修复跑道，供达科他式飞机降落——法国方面在一开始的时候这样坚持——是不适宜的。最迅速的撤运办法实际上是利用直升飞机。
    黄文欢说，在日内瓦有人说，在当地——越南——进行的谈判遭到了极大的困难。但是，事实上双方司令部在当地的谈判，直到法国方面破坏了五月十三日的协议、并在印度支那以外的人士的鼓动下提出了荒谬条件以前，是进展得顺利的。黄文欢着重指出，所有这些都见于五月二十七日由高文庆代表越南人民军总司令部代表团，胡尔教授代表法国远征军总司令部代表团签署的联合报告。
    黄文欢利用记者招待会的后一部分时间说明了目前正在日内瓦会议上讨论而在最近几天来曾被歪曲地解释的问题。
    他首先谈到越南民主共和国代表团所提出的，关于在印度支那建立和平的建议里所包括的政治性措施和军事性措施之间的相互关系。他说明越南民主共和国代表团在这个问题上的立场如下：
    “停火是一个非常重要的问题。在采取政治措施以前必须先实现停火。我们在五月十日的会议上所提出的建议的第八项说得非常清楚：在执行建议的第一项到第七项所规定的各种措施以前，即：执行关于承认印度支那三国的独立、撤退外国军队、举行自由普选以及参加法兰西联邦等等问题的措施以前，必须先停止军事行动，因为我们认为，假若不实现停火，上述各种措施是无法实行的。
    但是，假如根据这一点就认为停火和政治性的措施毫无关系，那就是曲解了问题。停火的目的是要建立持久和平，而持久和平必须以承认印度支那三国人民的基本权利为基础，以印度支那三国人民和法国人民之间的友谊为基础。
    在过去几天中，日内瓦会议一直在讨论军事问题。你们都知道，其初步结果已经在五月二十九日的限制性会议的公报中宣布了。会议将转入政治问题的讨论，因为很明显，在恢复印度支那和平方面，政治问题和军事问题是分不开的。”
    黄文欢然后谈到确定交战双方军队的集结地区的问题。
    黄文欢说：“我们在日内瓦会议上提出的建议中包括这个问题。有人硬说我们这样提就是建议分治我们祖国的领土。
    试问：我们应该怎样做才能保证印度支那的停火呢？假使交战双方的军队不在他们各自占领的地区中被隔离开来的话，怎么能实现停火呢？
    由此可见，那些反对确定集结地区以便把双方的军队隔离开来的人是不希望停火的。
    我们过去是、现在是、而且将来也将是为争取我们祖国的独立和统一而斗争的坚决的、始终不渝的战士。我们建议划分集结地区，因为我们知道，这是走向实现停火的唯一道路，而没有停火，和平是不可能实现的。
    我们认为，划分集结地区——这是实现停火的必要条件——只是一种暂时的措施，这种措施将为举行自由和民主的选举以建立国家的领土和政治的统一铺平道路。
    这种企图使人民相信我们主张分治我们国家的领土的说法在事实面前当然是站不住脚的。”
