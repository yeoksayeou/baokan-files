Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st: According to a TASS report from New York on the 20th: According to news from Guatemala, Guatemalan President Arbenz delivered a radio address calling on workers and peasants to "rise up, resist the invaders, and defend Guatemala."

Arbenz said that the invading army had penetrated several kilometers into Guatemalan territory, entering the districts of Barrio and Chiquimula. However, he believed that the Guatemalan army would be victorious.

In his speech, Arbenz condemned the United States, Nicaragua, and Honduras for supporting the invading army and inciting a rebellion against his government. Arbenz believed that the Guatemalan army would achieve victory. The threat to the people's freedom instigated by imperialist forces would thus come to an end. He angrily denounced the malicious movement orchestrated by the United States, with the support of Honduras and Nicaragua, to intensify international tensions. Arbenz said: "No Guatemalan is willing to give up freedom or be deprived of democracy. We will repay the aggressor with what he uses against us, that is, guns."

Arbenz said that the rebels declared that they would "victoriously enter Guatemala City by June 25th, but they will not enter Guatemala City on June 25th, nor will they enter at any time thereafter. Our people should know that our enemies have never taken into account such a factor, which is the people. All citizens of Guatemala should rise up to defend the country."

    危地马拉总统阿本斯发表广播演说
    号召全国人民起来抵抗侵略者保卫祖国
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十日讯：据危地马拉消息，危地马拉总统阿本斯发表广播演说，号召工人和农民“起来抵抗侵略者，保卫危地马拉”。
    阿本斯说，入侵的军队已深入危地马拉境内好几公里，进入巴利俄区和契卡穆拉区。但是他相信，危地马拉军队是会胜利的。
    阿本斯在他的演说中谴责美国、尼加拉瓜和洪都拉斯在支持侵略军队，煽动起反对他的政府的叛乱。阿本斯认为危地马拉军队会得到胜利的。帝国主义势力唆使起来的对人民自由的威胁，将就此完结。他怒斥美国所策动的、有洪都拉斯和尼加拉瓜附和的别有用心的运动，是要加紧国际紧张局势。阿本斯说：“没有一个危地马拉人愿意放弃自由，愿意被剥夺民主制度。侵略者用什么对待我们，我们也以什么回敬他，这就是枪炮。”
    阿本斯说，叛乱者宣布说，他们要“到六月二十五日胜利进入危地马拉城，但是，他们在六月二十五日进不了危地马拉城，以后任何时候也是进不去的。我们人民应该知道，我们的敌人始终没有考虑到这样一个因素，这就是人民。危地马拉的全体公民应奋起保卫国家。”
