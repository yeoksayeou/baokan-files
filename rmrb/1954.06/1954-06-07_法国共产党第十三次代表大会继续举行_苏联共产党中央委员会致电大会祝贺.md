Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 6th: According to TASS, the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party continued on the evening of June 3rd, and the afternoon and evening of June 4th.

    The evening session on the 3rd began with a discussion of Jacques Duclos' report.

    Jean Kahn, representative of the Communist Party of the Rhône department committee, spoke on behalf of the provincial committee in support of the Central Committee's summary report. He then spoke about the struggle of the provincial committee for peace. He pointed out that due to the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the Rhône department committees of both the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist Party were opposed to ratifying the Paris Treaty. The ranks opposing the "European Army" in the province are growing. Many National Assembly members representing the province are also opposed to ratifying the Paris Treaty. The province is also engaged in a broad struggle to stop military operations in Vietnam.

    The Congress unanimously passed a resolution protesting the Ranier government's refusal to issue entry visas to representatives of Communist and Workers' parties from People's Democratic countries and other countries to enter France, and protesting the government's ban on representatives of the Italian Communist Party invited to attend the Congress from entering France. The Congress also passed a resolution to send a special delegation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest.

    The morning session on the 4th continued the discussion of Jacques Duclos' report. The representatives who spoke in the discussion emphasized that the entire French people have an unstoppable desire to change the government's current policy, restore France's national independence, guarantee peace and national security, and refuse to ratify the infamous "European Defense Community" treaty. The six representatives who spoke at the morning session on the 4th attached great importance to the unity of action between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party in opposing the "European Army" and striving for peace in Vietnam, as well as in safeguarding the economic demands of the working people.

    At the afternoon session of the Congress, Political Bureau member Étienne Fajon read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party. The full text is as follows:

    To the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party:

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sends fraternal greetings to the 13th Congress of the French Communist Party.

    The glorious French Communist Party – the long-tempered leader of the French working class – has won the deserved respect and trust of the broad masses of the people through its tireless struggle for peace, democracy, and national independence.

    Under the leadership of the French Communist Party, the French working class and working people are waging a successful struggle for their own vital interests and democratic freedoms, and against the enslavement of France by American imperialism.

    The French Communist Party is the vanguard of the French people's struggle for peace and the consolidation of European and world security, against the threat of new wars, against the establishment of military blocs, and against the expansion of armaments. The French Communists are inspiring and leading all true French patriots.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wishes the French Communist Party new achievements in the cause of defending national independence and the vital interests of the working people, in organizing united action of the working class and uniting all patriotic forces in the country, in consolidating its ranks and educating all party members in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and in the struggle for peace, democracy and socialism.

    Long live the French Communist Party – the vanguard of the French working class and all the working people of France!

    Long live the friendship between the Soviet and French people!

                        The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

    The delegates attending the Congress warmly welcomed the telegram, responding with stormy applause and shouting long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee. All the delegates stood up and sang "The Internationale."

    After the telegram was read, Étienne Fajon, on behalf of all Communist Party members and the French working class, repeated the famous saying of Maurice Thorez: The French people will never fight the Soviet Union. At this time, the entire venue stood up and applauded thunderously. Then, Benoît Frachon, General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, gave a long speech. He talked about the tasks of the Communist Party in the trade union movement.

    Next, d'Astier de la Vigerie, a member of the Progressive Republican Alliance and a member of the National Assembly, congratulated the delegates to the 13th Congress.

    Louis Aragon, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a famous French writer, gave a detailed analysis of the Party's activities among intellectuals in his speech.

    At the evening session on the 4th, Marcel Servin, Secretary of the Central Committee, gave a report on the second item on the agenda, "Issues of the Party's Organizational Work." His report mainly discussed the role of Communist Party branches in various enterprises and analyzed the errors of Léopold, the former Secretary of Organizational Work of the Central Committee.

    Servin pointed out that there is currently an abnormal situation that distorts the essence of the Party, namely, there are two types of Party members: one is a Party member who works for the Party, and the other is a passive Party member. Party leaders often do not pay enough attention to the issue of recruiting new Party members. He said: We often recruit new Party members on the one hand, and lose existing Party members on the other. The report also extensively analyzed the role of Party branches in enterprises.

    Servin said that the unnecessary debates caused by Léopold on the issue of the relationship between the Party and the trade union, and the incorrect conclusions he made, limited the work of Party branches in many local enterprises to maintaining economic demands. In order to show that the Party and the trade union were organizationally different, the branches carried out abstract propaganda work.

    Servin emphasized that recently, there have been improvements in this regard, and Party branches in enterprises have been fighting more closely for extremely important issues such as opposing the "European Army" and striving to stop the Vietnam War. Party branches should unite all workers in enterprises to fight for national independence and peace, organize a united front with socialist workers to achieve common political and economic goals, explain the Party's policies, and publicize the Soviet Union's great achievements and its peace policy.

    Servin said that it should be pointed out that it is necessary to absorb tens of thousands of young people to strengthen our Party's ranks. In general, our Party must be an active and organized Party, and must take action, not just propaganda. We must be a new type of Party that, in order to successfully complete its tasks, should go deep into the working class and deep into industrial enterprises.

    Attention must also be paid to the fact that the activities of our branches should not be purely internal activities. It is necessary to study the masses, their needs, wishes and demands. It is necessary to make the masses understand our Party, cherish our Party, so that we can defend them, organize them, and attract them to participate in the struggle.

    Servin then pointed out that it is necessary to carefully select and educate cadres. He pointed out that there is still conservatism in this regard, and that capable young staff members have not been boldly promoted. The absorption of women into the Party's leadership is still very poor.

    Servin finally called for strengthening vigilance and preventing hostile elements from infiltrating the Party's ranks.

    Servin said that the principles of Leninist collective leadership, democratic centralism, criticism and self-criticism must be unconditionally observed.

    Servin hoped that the 13th Party Congress would lay the foundation for widely launching a movement to recruit new Party members and for expanding the struggle of the masses of the people for France's national independence, for peace, and for social progress.

    The meeting of the Congress on June 4th announced that a delegation from the Congress, headed by Political Bureau member François Billoux, visited the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and submitted a resolution protesting the refusal to issue entry visas to the fraternal parties from People's Democratic countries who were invited to attend the Congress. The delegation received assurances that the necessary visas would be issued. At the same time, the government allowed representatives of the Italian Communist Party who were invited to attend the Congress to enter the country.

    法国共产党第十三次代表大会继续举行
    苏联共产党中央委员会致电大会祝贺
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党第十三次代表大会于六月三日晚间和四日上下午及晚间继续举行会议。
    三日晚间会议，开始就雅克·杜克洛的报告进行讨论。
    罗尼省共产党省委员会代表让·康代表省委员会表示拥护中央委员会的总结报告。他接着讲到该省省委员会争取和平的斗争的情况。他指出，由于广大人民群众的压力，罗尼省的激进社会党和社会党的省委员会都在反对批准巴黎条约。该省反对“欧洲军”的队伍日益壮大。代表该省的许多国民议会议员也都在反对批准巴黎条约。该省还在为停止越南军事行动而展开广泛的斗争。
    代表大会一致通过了一项决议，抗议拉尼埃政府拒绝发给人民民主国家和其他国家的共产党和工人党的代表进入法国的入境签证，并抗议政府禁止应邀参加代表大会的意大利共产党代表进入法国。代表大会并通过了决议，决定派遣一个特别代表团到外交部提出抗议。
    四日上午的会议，继续讨论雅克·杜克洛的报告。在讨论中发言的代表都着重指出，全体法国人民有着不可遏止的愿望，要求改变政府的现行政策，恢复法国的民族独立，保障和平与国家的安全，并拒绝批准臭名远扬的“欧洲防务集团”条约。在四日上午会议上发言的有六个代表，他们极其重视共产党和社会党在反对“欧洲军”和争取越南和平方面，以及在维护劳动人民的经济要求方面的行动一致的问题。
    在代表大会下午会议上，政治局委员艾蒂安·法戎宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会致法国共产党第十三次代表大会的贺电，全文如下：
    法国共产党第十三次代表大会：
    苏联共产党中央委员会向法国共产党第十三次代表大会致兄弟的祝贺。
    光荣的法国共产党——久经锻炼的法国工人阶级的领导者，以它不倦的争取和平、民主与民族独立的斗争而获得了广大人民群众的应有的尊崇和信任。
    法国工人阶级和劳动人民在法国共产党领导下，为争取自己切身利益和民主自由，为反对美国帝国主义对法国的奴役进行着成功的斗争。
    法国共产党是法国人民争取和平和巩固欧洲和世界安全、反对新战争的威胁、反对建立军事集团和扩充军备的斗争的先锋。法国共产党人鼓舞着和领导着所有法国真正的爱国人士。
    苏联共产党中央委员会祝法国共产党在保卫民族独立和劳动人民切身利益的事业中，在组织工人阶级统一行动和团结国内一切爱国力量、巩固自己的队伍和以马克思—列宁主义精神教育全体党员的事业中，在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中获得新的成就。
    法国共产党——法国工人阶级和法国全体劳动人民的先锋队万岁！
    苏法两国人民的友谊万岁！
                        苏联共产党中央委员会
    参加代表大会的代表们热烈欢迎这个贺电，报以暴风雨般的掌声，并高呼伟大的苏联共产党及其中央委员会万岁。大会全体代表起立唱“国际歌”。
    宣读贺电后，艾蒂安·法戎代表法国全体共产党党员和法国工人阶级重复了莫里斯·多列士所说的一句名言：法国人民决不对苏联作战。此时全场起立，掌声雷动。然后法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商作了长篇发言。他谈到了共产党在工会运动中的任务。
    接着，进步共和联盟盟员，国民议会议员达斯迪埃·德拉维热里向第十三次代表大会代表们致贺。
    共产党中央委员会委员、法国名作家路易·阿拉贡在发言中对党在知识分子中的活动作了详尽的分析。
    在四日晚间的会议上，中央委员会书记马赛尔·赛尔文就第二项议程“党的组织工作问题”作了报告。他的报告主要是谈到了各企业中共产党支部的作用，并分析了中央委员会前组织工作书记勒戈尔的错误。
    赛尔文指出，目前有着一种会使党的本质遭到歪曲的不正常的情况，即有着两类党员：一种是为党工作的党员，另外一种是消极的党员。党的领导人往往对吸收新党员问题不加以足够的注意。他说：我们常常一方面吸收新党员，另一方面失去原有党员。报告并广泛地分析了党支部在企业中的作用。
    赛尔文说，勒戈尔在关于党和工会之间的关系的问题上所引起的无谓的争辩和他所作出的不正确的论断，使许多地方的企业党支部的工作仅限于维护经济要求。而为了要显示党和工会的组织有所不同，支部就进行抽象的宣传工作。
    赛尔文着重指出，最近，这方面已有改进，企业中的党支部已在更加紧地为反对“欧洲军”和争取停止越南战争这样一些极为重要的问题而进行斗争。党支部应当团结企业中所有的工人为民族独立与和平而斗争，组织与社会党工人的统一阵线以达到共同的政治和经济目的，解释党的政策，宣传苏联的巨大成就及其和平政策。
    赛尔文说，应当指出，必须要吸收成千成万的青年来加强我们党的队伍。总而言之，我们的党必须是一个有行动有组织的党，必须要有行动，而不仅是宣传。我们必需是一个新型的党，它为了胜利地完成自己的任务，应当深入到工人阶级中去，深入到工业企业中去。
    还必须注意，我们支部的活动不应当是纯粹的内部活动。必须研究群众，研究他们的需要、愿望和要求。必须要使群众了解我们的党，珍视我们的党，这样我们才能保卫他们，组织他们和吸引他们参加斗争。
    赛尔文接着指出，必须慎重地选拔和教育干部。他指出，在这方面到现在还有墨守成规的情形，没有能大胆提拔有能力的青年工作人员。吸收妇女参加党的领导工作做得还很差。
    赛尔文最后号召加强警惕，谨防敌对分子渗入党的队伍。
    赛尔文说，必须无条件遵守列宁主义的集体领导、民主集中制、批评和自我批评的原则。
    赛尔文希望第十三次党代表大会为广泛展开吸收新党员运动，为扩大人民群众争取法国民族独立、争取和平及社会进步的斗争奠定基础。
    代表大会六月四日的会议宣布，以政治局委员弗朗索瓦·皮佑为首的代表大会的代表团访问了法国外交部，并递交了一项决议，抗议拒绝发给应邀前来参加代表大会的人民民主国家兄弟党的来宾们入境签证一事。代表团得到了保证，将发给必要的签证。同时，政府允许应邀前来参加代表大会的意大利共产党代表入境。
