Using Mutual Aid and Cooperation Networks to Drive Mutual Aid Teams Forward
Cheng Yihua

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in Ciyun Township, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, began in 1952 during the fight against drought. At that time, 882 households, accounting for 55% of the township's total households, were organized in all eight villages of the township. Later, due to the relaxation of leadership by the cadres, many groups dissolved; by last winter, only 347 households remained in the mutual aid teams. After vigorously publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period, the broad masses of peasants raised their socialist consciousness, clearly recognized the direction of rural economic development, and actively participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The township's fifteen permanent mutual aid teams formed three agricultural production cooperatives, and the newly established mutual aid teams and the original mutual aid teams that had not transitioned to cooperatives totaled 178; the number of households participating in cooperatives and teams accounted for 87.4% of the township's total households. Such a large development brought many problems. The most important was the large number of newly established mutual aid teams, while the team backbone was weak and lacked experience. Problems such as work arrangement and equal exchange for mutual benefit could not be well resolved, affecting the production enthusiasm of the team members. Some township cadres also felt that so many mutual aid teams were difficult to lead and asked higher authorities to send more cadres.

In order to solve this problem, the Ciyun Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party first experimented with the leadership method of "using stations to lead points and points to promote the surface" in Yange Village with the Diaoshiba Agricultural Production Cooperative as the center, and absorbed experience. In March of this year, the branch general assembly studied the leadership of mutual aid teams in spring production. At the meeting, everyone studied the experience of Wangmang Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, in piloting mutual aid and cooperation networks. Based on the demands of the masses and the results of the pilot in Yange Village, it was decided to establish mutual aid and cooperation networks throughout the township. Mutual aid teams in each village were divided into areas to set up points based on the principle of voluntariness (each area elected a key team through democratic elections), and 24 points were set up in the township's eight villages, with the three agricultural production cooperatives as stations; the three stations led the 24 points respectively, and the 24 points led the township's 178 mutual aid teams respectively.

After the establishment of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the main problems existing in the mutual aid teams were resolved in a timely manner during this year's spring production, which consolidated many mutual aid teams and ensured the smooth progress of spring production.

The first was to solve the problem of work arrangement. Previously, many mutual aid teams had poorly resolved work arrangement problems, wasting labor and hindering production. Team members competed with each other and often had disagreements. The mutual aid and cooperation network exchanged experiences in this area before sowing and transplanting rice seedlings, which solved the problems of many teams. For example, the Diaoyousheng mutual aid team in the Fifth Village originally arranged farm work every morning, and there was no standard for the order of arrangement. Chen Shanshu, a team member, could have delayed the work of his rice paddies for two days, but he competed to be arranged in the front, causing a lot of resentment. Later, the team leader heard the experience of the Gujiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in arranging work at the meeting of key teams in the mutual aid and cooperation network, and after returning, he discussed with the team members and decided to arrange the work according to the urgency of various tasks through democratic discussion; this solved the problem of competing for work and time. Many members of the Yuan Jinhe mutual aid team in the Second Village also competed for work and time; later, the team leader learned the experience of other teams in arranging work at the working meeting of the cooperation network. Combining the specific situation of his team, he adopted the method of "long-term planning (once a month) and short-term arrangement (once every three days)." For example, it was decided that the main task from April 12th to May 11th would be rice transplanting, and the order would be arranged according to "transplanting first on high terrain, transplanting first on distant roads, and transplanting first where seedlings are deeply lacking." The whole team needed a total of 227 workdays for rice transplanting in one month. There were seven full laborers and one semi-laborer in the team. After reasonable allocation, the labor force was just enough; if they worked hard, they could complete the task ahead of schedule. Last year, when they transplanted rice seedlings, they did not plan the work in advance. When the time came, they could not handle it, and they hired more than 20 temporary workers and argued with each other. Now, 41 teams in the township have implemented the method of planning once a month and arranging every three days.

The second was to improve the scoring and work recording system. During the spring plowing season, sixteen mutual aid teams in the township learned advanced experience in the mutual aid and cooperation network, improved the scoring and work recording system, and improved labor efficiency. Some teams with better conditions also changed "do first, then evaluate" to "evaluate first, then do" (that is, contracting for small tasks with fixed quality and quantity). For example, the Yuan Jinhe mutual aid team originally scored points after finishing work every day. Everyone was embarrassed to criticize each other, and everyone was rated the same. Later, after learning the method of "evaluate first, then do" from the Han Jinting team in the mutual aid and cooperation network, they first evaluated the work points that each task should get and then assigned people to do it, which reduced the phenomenon of wasted work and absenteeism. The team originally planned to spend 23 workdays to build field ridges and plant soybeans. Implementing the "evaluate first, then do" method, the team members wanted to work more and earn more points, which stimulated their enthusiasm, and as a result, they finished the work in 20 workdays.

The third was to correct the phenomenon of unequal exchange for mutual benefit. The Diaoyousheng team originally used larger farm tools for public use without compensation; as a result, some team members refused to install a new plowshare even if they bought one, and some team members also slacked off in their work. After the leader of the key team discovered this problem, he specifically helped them hold a meeting, explained the principles of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit, and everyone decided to change the method of using farm tools to private ownership and rental use by team members. After this regulation was made, the person who bought the new plowshare installed it, and the whole team also added some other farm tools, and the production enthusiasm of the team members was also improved. The Yuan Jinhe team in the First Village originally had low wages, with a standard score of four points per day and 400 yuan per point, and everyone ate separately. Team members reflected: "The money for food is not enough, there is no prospect in working a day." But no one dared to say it publicly for fear of being accused of "capitalist ideas." After participating in the mutual aid and cooperation network, they understood the principle of mutual benefit and appropriately increased wages.

The mutual aid and cooperation network also played a great role in promoting advanced experience in this year's spring production. When publicizing "good seeds and strong seedlings," the Diaoshiba Agricultural Production Cooperative was first used as a typical demonstration, organized observations, and then continuously demonstrated at 17 points, promoting more than 90% of the farmers in the township to achieve seed selection with mud and water, sparse sowing of grain seeds, and new-style seedling fields. The promotion of "sparse seedlings and dense planting" during rice transplanting also adopted the method of promoting through layer-by-layer demonstrations.

The mutual aid and cooperation network has also enabled many mutual aid team leaders and village cadres to improve their leadership ability and enhance their confidence in running mutual aid teams well.

Driven by the mutual aid and cooperation network, the mutual aid teams in Ciyun Township have generally improved during the tense spring plowing season. Some mutual aid teams that were originally just formalities have become active; 48 temporary mutual aid teams in the township have been promoted to permanent mutual aid teams; 12 of the original permanent mutual aid teams have implemented methods such as planned production and contracting for small tasks, actively creating conditions for establishing cooperatives.

    运用互助合作网带动互助组前进
    程宜华
    四川江津县慈云乡的互助合作运动，是一九五二年在防旱抗旱中开展起来的。当时，全乡八个村，组织起来的农户有八百八十二户，占全乡总农户的百分之五十五。后来，由于干部放松领导，很多组散伙；到去年冬季，留在互助组里的就只有三百四十七户了。大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线以后，广大农民提高了社会主义觉悟，明确地认识了农村经济的发展方向，又积极参加互助合作组织。全乡由十五个常年互助组组成了三个农业生产合作社，新成立的互助组和原有的没有转社的互助组共有一百七十八个；参加社和组的户数占全乡总农户的百分之八十七点四。这样的大发展，带来了很多问题。最主要的是新成立的互助组多，而组内骨干较弱，缺少经验，排工调工、等价互利等问题不能很好地解决，影响到组员的生产情绪。部分乡干部也觉得这样多互助组不好领导，要求上级多派些干部来。
    中共慈云乡支部为了解决这个问题，就先在雁硚村以刁石坝农业生产合作社为中心试行“以站带点、以点推面”的领导方法，吸取经验。今年三月，支部大会研究春季生产中互助组的领导问题。在会上，大家学习了陕西省长安县王莽村试办互助合作网的经验，根据群众的要求和雁硚村试行的成绩，确定在全乡建立互助合作网。各村互助组按自愿原则分片设点（每片用民主选举的方式选出一个重点组），全乡八个村设立二十四个点，以三个农业生产合作社为站；三个站分别带动二十四个点，二十四个点分别带动全乡一百七十八个互助组。
    互助合作网成立后，在今年春季生产中及时地解决了互助组内存在的主要问题，使许多互助组巩固起来，保证了春季生产的顺利进行。
    首先是解决了排工问题。以前许多互助组因为排工问题解决得不好，多花费劳力，还妨碍生产，组员之间争先恐后，常闹意见。互助合作网在播种前和插秧前都交流了这方面的经验，解决了许多组的问题。如五村刁有胜互助组原来是每天早上安排一次农活，安排的次序也没有什么标准。组员陈善书秧田的活本来可以迟两天，但他争着要排在前头，闹得“气膨气胀”的。后来组长在互助合作网重点组的会议上听了古家庄农业生产合作社排活的经验，回来就找组员商量，决定根据各种活的缓急由大家民主讨论来安排；这样，就解决了争工抢时的问题。二村袁金和互助组的许多组员，原来也是争工抢时；后来组长在合作网的工作会上学习了别组排工的经验，结合本组具体情况，采用了“长计划
  （一月一次）短安排（三天一次）”的办法。如订出四月十二日到五月十一日一个月的活以栽秧为主，再根据“地势高的先栽、路程远的先栽、缺苗深的先栽”来安排次序。全组栽秧一个月共需二百二十七个工，组内有七个整劳动力和一个半劳动力，经过合理调配，劳动力刚好够用；如果努力，还能提前完成。他们去年栽秧时，没能事先有计划地排好活，到时候忙不过来，请了二十多个零工，还互相争工闹意见。现在全乡已有四十一个组实行了一月一计划、三天一安排的办法。
    第二是改进了评分计工制度。全乡有十六个互助组春耕生产期间在互助合作网中学习了先进经验，改进了评分计工制度，提高了劳动效率。有些条件较好的组还把“先做后评”改成“先评后做”
  （就是定质定量的小包工）。如袁金和互助组原来是每天做完了活评分，大家打不开情面，各人评得一样多。以后在互助合作网里学了韩金廷组“先评后做”的办法，先把每件活应得的工分评出来再派人去做，就减少了窝工和旷工的现象。组里原计划搭田坎点豆子要二十三个工，实行先评后做，组员想多作点多得分，发挥了积极性，结果二十个工就做完了。
    第三是纠正不等价互利的现象。刁有胜组原来把较大的农具无代价归公使用；这样一来，有的组员买了一张新铧口也不肯装到犁上去了，有些组员干活也松劲了。重点组组长发现这个问题后，专门去帮他们开了会，说明等价交换、互助互利的原则，大家决定把农具的使用办法改为组员私有、租借使用。这样规定以后，买了新铧的人就把铧装上了，全组还新添了一些别的农具，组员们的生产情绪也提高了。一村龚治荣组原来工资低，每天标准分是四分，每分四百元，又是各吃各的。组员反映：吃饭的钱都不够，干一天没想头。但是谁也不敢公开提，怕人家说是“资本主义思想”。参加互助合作网后，懂得了互利原则，便把工资适当地提高了。
    互助合作网在今年春季生产中，对推广先进经验也起了很大作用。宣传“好种壮秧”时，先以刁石坝农业生产合作社作典型示范，组织观摩，又在十七个点连续示范，推动全乡百分之九十以上的农户做到泥水选种、稀撒谷种并做了新式秧田。栽秧时推广“少秧密植”，也是采取层层示范的办法推广的。
    互助合作网还使许多互助组长和乡村干部提高了领导能力，增强了办好互助组的信心。
    在互助合作网的带动下，在紧张的春耕生产中，慈云乡的互助组普遍提高了。有些本来空具形式的互助组已经活动起来；全乡有四十八个临时互助组提高为常年互助组；原来的常年互助组中有十二个组实行了计划生产、小包工等办法，积极为办社创造条件。
