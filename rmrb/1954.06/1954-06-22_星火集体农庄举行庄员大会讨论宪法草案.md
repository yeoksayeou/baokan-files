Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 19th: The Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, held a general meeting of members on the 17th to discuss the draft constitution. They were very pleased to have the right to participate in the discussion of the draft constitution. Based on their profound experiences of living in the collective farm for the past three years, the members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm enthusiastically supported the draft constitution. Jin Baishan, the chairman of the collective farm, said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we organized the collective farm. Now the farm has grown from 36 households and 99 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of cultivated land at the time of its establishment to 121 households and 400 hectares of cultivated land. With the development of the collective farm and the increase in mechanization, the lives of the members have been greatly improved. In 1953, the average income of each member was more than 13 million yuan. Jin Baishan continued: "This draft constitution also clearly stipulates the development of the cooperative economy, which will be of greater help to the development of the collective farm." Female member Jin Caijin said: The rights of women in the Xinghuo Collective Farm in political, economic, cultural, social, and family life have been equal to those of men. The farm attaches great importance to mothers and children. When female members give birth, they have sufficient rest before and after childbirth, and they are also subsidized 10% of the workdays based on the number of days they participate in labor. The farm's nursery solves the difficulty for mothers with children who cannot go to the fields. Zheng Xinyu, the wife of Shen Zicheng, earned 120 workdays last year after entrusting her child to the nursery. At the meeting, elderly people, members who had lost their labor power, and young people also spoke enthusiastically in support of the draft constitution because they received good care on the farm. For example, when the father of member Zhu Zongyu died, Zhu Zongyu was still in middle school, and his mother could not participate in labor. The farm provided relief from the public welfare fund to provide him with two years of tuition, and now he has joined agricultural production.
    At the meeting, the members expressed one after another that they would support the promulgation of the draft constitution with practical actions. Member Jiang Jingxiao said: The central task of the farm at present is summer hoeing, to eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken spaces in the paddy fields, and to increase grain production to support industrial construction. Chairman Jin Baishan, on behalf of all the members, proposed: Do a good job in summer hoeing, and increase the yield of rice by 2,000 jin per hectare on the 180 hectares of newly reclaimed cultivated land. Strive to sell 3 million jin of rice to the state.

    星火集体农庄举行庄员大会讨论宪法草案
    【新华社佳木斯十九日电】松江省桦川县星火集体农庄在十七日举行庄员大会讨论宪法草案。他们对自己有权利参加宪法草案的讨论感到非常高兴。星火集体农庄的庄员们，根据自己三年来集体农庄生活的深刻体会，热烈拥护宪法草案。集体农庄主席金白山说：我们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，组织了集体农庄。现在农庄已由建庄时三十六户、九十九垧（每垧十五市亩）耕地，增加到一百二十一户、四百垧耕地了。随着集体农庄的发展和机械化程度的增长，庄员生活都得到很大改善，一九五三年平均每个庄员收入一千三百多万元。金白山接着说：“这个宪法草案又明确规定了发展合作社经济，对集体农庄事业的发展将会有更大的帮助。”女庄员金彩今说：星火集体农庄的妇女，在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各个方面的权利已和男子平等。农庄对母亲和儿童非常重视。女庄员生育时，产前产后有足够的休息，还根据她参加劳动的日数补助百分之十的工作日。农庄的托儿所为有小孩的母亲解决了不能下地的困难。慎自成的妻子郑信玉，去年把孩子交给托儿所照管后，得了一百二十个工作日。会上老年人、丧失劳动力的庄员和青年人也热烈发言拥护宪法草案。因为他们在农庄得到很好的照顾。如庄员朱宗郁的父亲死了的时候朱宗郁还在中学读书，母亲不能参加劳动，农庄就从公益金里给予救济，供给他两年学费，现在他已参加农业生产了。
    庄员们在大会上纷纷提出要以实际行动来拥护宪法草案的公布。庄员姜敬孝说：目前农庄中心任务是夏锄，要消灭水田中的缺苗断空现象，增产粮食支援工业建设。主席金白山代表全体庄员提出：做好夏锄工作，在一百八十垧新开垦的耕地上，每垧地增产二千斤稻谷。争取卖给国家三百万斤稻谷。
