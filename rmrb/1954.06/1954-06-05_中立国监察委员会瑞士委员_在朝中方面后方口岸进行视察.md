During his short inspection of Manpo, Sinuiju, and Sinanju, Brigadier General Gross participated in the routine inspection activities of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, inspecting the railway stations and airports of the ports. As with previous inspections by the teams, the inspection results were satisfactory, and no questions were raised, as the Korean-Chinese side strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement and the agreements between the two sides. Brigadier General Gross also participated in the meetings of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and other activities.

In his conversations with the four national members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and the local Korean-Chinese liaison officers, Brigadier General Gross emphasized that the task of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is important and arduous. He pointed out that the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has made a great contribution to peace and expressed his hope that this work would continue. He also pointed out that it is understandable that different people have different opinions. He firmly believes that if the four national personnel maintain cooperation, these opinions can be resolved well.

    格罗斯准将在和中立国视察小组的四国组员以及当地朝中联络军官的谈话中强调，中立国监察委员会的任务是重要而又艰巨的。他指出中立国监察委员会的工作为和平作了很大的贡献，并且希望把这一工作继续下去。他还指出，不同的人总是有不同的意见，这是很可以理解的。他深信四国人员保持合作，这些意见就可以获得良好的解决。
