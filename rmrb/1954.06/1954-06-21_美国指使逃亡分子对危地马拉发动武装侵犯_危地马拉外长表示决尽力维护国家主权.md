Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: An armed force of approximately 5,000 people, led by fugitive military officer and agent of the American United Fruit Company, Carlos Castillo Armas, and supported by the United States government, invaded Guatemalan territory from Honduras on the 18th in an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of Guatemala.

According to American news agencies, this armed invasion force, equipped and financially supported by the United States, was formed in Honduras. From there, the force invaded Guatemala by land and sea via Puerto Barrios on the Caribbean coast, Quetzaltenango on the Pacific coast, and Zacapa in the southeast bordering Honduras, occupying several cities bordering Honduras. According to United Press, these conspirators were supported by more than a dozen aircraft and ships. "Foreign" aircraft also bombed oil depots in Puerto San José, Guatemala, on the Pacific coast.

Prior to this armed invasion, the Guatemalan government repeatedly exposed the US government's conspiracy to plan armed intervention in Guatemala. Not long ago, the United States fabricated the story that "a large number of weapons were transported from Soviet-controlled territory to Guatemala" and used this as a pretext to begin transporting large quantities of military supplies to Honduras and other countries, stepping up the organization of this armed invasion.

Guatemalan Foreign Minister Toriello issued a statement on the armed invasion. He criticized the conspiracy supported by American companies, especially the United Fruit Company, aimed at overthrowing the Arbenz government. Toriello stated that the Guatemalan people are prepared to "accept the greatest sacrifices to safeguard Guatemalan sovereignty."

    美国指使逃亡分子对危地马拉发动武装侵犯
    危地马拉外长表示决尽力维护国家主权
    【新华社十九日讯】华盛顿消息：受到美国政府支持的、以逃亡军官和美国联合果品公司的代理人卡洛斯·卡斯蒂略·阿马斯为首所组成的为数约五千人的武装力量，十八日自洪都拉斯方面侵入危地马拉领土，企图颠覆危地马拉民主政府。
    据美国通讯社报道，这支由美国给予装备和财政上支持的武装侵犯力量，是在洪都拉斯组成的。这支武装从那里由陆海两路向危地马拉的位于加勒比海岸的巴利俄港、太平洋岸的克扎尔特纳戈和东南部接邻洪都拉斯的萨卡柏侵入危地马拉，接邻洪都拉斯边界的几个城市已被占领。据合众社透露，这些阴谋分子曾获得十多架飞机和船只的支持。并有“外国”飞机去轰炸危地马拉的位于太平洋岸的圣荷塞港的油库。
    早在这次武装侵犯发生以前，危地马拉政府就曾一再揭发美国政府阴谋策划对危地马拉的武装干涉。不久前，美国捏造“有大批武器从苏联控制的领土运往危地马拉”，并以此为借口，开始运送大批军火到洪都拉斯等国家，加紧组织这次武装侵犯。
    危地马拉外交部长托里埃略就这次武装侵犯事件发表了谈话。他抨击美国公司尤其是联合果品公司所支持的这次旨在推翻阿本斯政府的阴谋。托里埃略表示危地马拉人民准备“接受最大的牺牲，来维护危地马拉的主权”。
