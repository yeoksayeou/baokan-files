Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: "Pravda" published on the 29th a dispatch from its correspondent in Delhi, Orestov, entitled "The Great Friendship of the People." The correspondent wrote: The public in Asian countries attaches great importance to the meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and China, two major Asian countries. This meeting once again shows that the people of China and India have no other desire than peace, friendship, and cooperation, nor can they have any. This meeting sets an example for Asian countries, telling them how Asian problems can and must be solved.

The desire for peace and friendship is the main theme of all the speeches and greetings delivered by Zhou Enlai and Nehru. When speaking at the banquet hosted by the Indian Prime Minister, Zhou Enlai pointed out the five principles that form the basis of Sino-Indian friendly relations. It is extremely important that these principles have not only been announced as political declarations but have also been put into practice.

Orestov then pointed out that the meeting and talks between Zhou Enlai and Nehru in Delhi clearly demonstrated that these two major Asian countries have adopted a new approach to solving all problems. They oppose colonialism and interference from outside in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and emphatically stated that the Asian people themselves can and will determine their own destiny through peaceful consultation and cooperation.

The author then cited many examples to prove that the sincere friendship between these two great nations has grown and strengthened in recent years. He emphasized that this friendship is an extremely important factor in maintaining peace in Asia. It is a powerful force that can, to a large extent, contain the aggressors who are keen on launching new military adventures in Asia.

Orestov continued, since the founding of the People's Republic of China, India has continuously demanded that the government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal government of the country, represent the interests of the Chinese people in the United Nations. India has strongly supported the convening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, believing that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, important Asian issues cannot be resolved. Indian newspapers believe that the participation of the People's Republic of China in the Geneva Conference is a great victory for the Asian people. The Agreement on Trade and Traffic between the Tibet Region of China and India, signed on April 29, vividly reflects the friendly cooperation between India and the People's Republic of China.

The dispatch finally emphasizes that although the enemies of peace are doing their best to undermine cooperation between India and China and poisoning the relations between the two peoples with hostile propaganda, Sino-Indian friendship is developing day by day for the benefit of hundreds of millions of Asian people.

    伟大人民的友谊
    ——“真理报”二十九日刊载的通讯的摘要
   【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十九日刊载了它的驻德里记者奥列斯托夫的一篇题为“伟大人民的友谊”的通讯。记者写道：亚洲国家的公众极其重视印度和中国这两个亚洲大国的总理的会晤。这次会晤再次表明，中国和印度两国人民除了和平、友谊和合作的愿望之外，没有也不可能有任何其他愿望。这次会谈为亚洲各国树立了范例，告诉它们亚洲问题可以怎样地解决和必须怎样地解决。
    和平与友谊的愿望是周恩来和尼赫鲁所发表的一切演说和贺辞的主旨。周恩来在印度总理招待宴会上讲话时指出了作为中印友好关系的基础的五项原则。极为重要的是：这些原则不但已作为政治宣言而宣布，而且已经付诸实施。
    奥列斯托夫接着指出，周恩来和尼赫鲁在德里会晤和会谈明显地表明，这两个亚洲大国采取了新的方法来解决一切问题。他们反对殖民主义和从外面来的对亚洲各国人民内部事务的干涉，并着重声明，亚洲人民自己能够而且将会用和平协商与合作的方法来决定自己的命运。
    作者接着引述了许多例子证明，这两个伟大民族间的诚挚的友谊近几年来成长了和加强了。他强调指出：这个友谊是维护亚洲和平的一个极为重要的因素。它是一个强大的力量，可以在很大的程度上遏止住热中于在亚洲发动新的军事冒险的侵略者。
    奥列斯托夫继续写道，自中华人民共和国成立以来，印度就不断地要求让中华人民共和国政府作为这个国家的唯一合法政府在联合国代表中国人民的利益。印度曾极力支持日内瓦外长会议的召开，认为没有中华人民共和国的参加，亚洲的重要问题就不可能得到解决。印度报刊认为中华人民共和国的参加日内瓦会议是亚洲人民的一个大胜利。四月二十九日所签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定鲜明地反映出了印度和中华人民共和国的友好合作。
    通讯最后强调说，尽管和平的敌人竭力来破坏印度和中国之间的合作，以敌视的宣传来毒害这两国人民的关系，但是，印中友谊为了亿万的亚洲人民的利益而日益发展。
