Rural Party Organizations Must Educate Members to Love Agricultural Production Cooperatives

Our cooperative has seen a new atmosphere where everyone loves the cooperative and works for it.
Wu Shiping, Secretary of the Desheng Township Branch of the Communist Party of China, Jiangyou County
Director of Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative

Our cooperative was established in February this year. Because the branch relaxed its political and ideological education work after the cooperative was established, and the leading cadres were caught up in administrative affairs, the cooperative's production activities and management were very poor. At this time, I understood that political education work should be carried out among the members, but because I did not have experience in this area, I treated political education work as simply talking about grand principles, and of course, its effect was not great. Later, I realized that political and ideological education work must be combined with various production activities.

After the cooperative divided the production teams and established a division of labor responsibility system, there was a phenomenon that members simply earned work points and did not obey the distribution. The branch studied this issue and decided to solve it from two aspects. On the one hand, through concrete facts, it explained the principle that unified allocation of labor can improve production efficiency; on the other hand, it criticized and corrected the phenomenon of party members disobeying the distribution, and then educated the members through the exemplary actions of party members, League members, and activists. This worked very well. For example, party member Miao Hongzhi took the lead in repairing the embankments, influencing other members who were unwilling to repair the embankments to go as well. Youth League member Wu Shijun, in order to prevent fertilizer from being lost, not only covered the manure piles he was in charge of, but also persuaded and helped Lu Angui and Li Yongyu to cover the manure piles as well. Under their influence, Miao Changxiang and Miao Fazhi, who never covered manure piles, also covered the manure piles. The branch seized these exemplary examples and launched discussions among the members. Such discussions were very educational for the members, and everyone realized that the interests of the individual and the interests of the cooperative are consistent, and every action of the members should be for the sake of the entire cooperative. Due to the increased awareness of the members, many labor models continued to emerge, setting examples in various aspects, and ensuring the implementation of the production plan.

In order to make political education regular, the branch suggested that the cooperative management committee establish a system of criticism and self-criticism, and launched a mass inspection work among all members, which was very effective. For example, member Deng Wenzhong exposed the phenomenon of some people using small buckets to carry manure. The cooperative management committee brought it up for discussion among the members, and everyone believed that this was a personal plan to seek ease and earn work points, and criticized this behavior. Zhang Cailin, who used small buckets to carry manure, automatically made a self-criticism at the meeting; Jiang Xiangfa, Xiang Shilu, Lu Daxun and others also automatically changed to large buckets. For individual backward members, we organized party members and activists to help them regularly. As a result, our cooperative began to see a new atmosphere where everyone loved the cooperative and was enthusiastic about working for it.

Protect the cooperative's property as if it were your own.
Liu Yutian, Secretary of the Shuangshanzi Village Branch of the Communist Party of China, Kuanadian County
Director of the Meiman Agricultural Production Cooperative

Although our agricultural production cooperative has only been established for two or three months, many model members who cherish public property have already emerged. In order to make every member cherish the cooperative's property, we use these real people and real stories to educate the members. Wu Genquan, a seventy-year-old shepherd, is a model member. In March, the cooperative added a lot of lambs, and Wu Genquan had to get up one or two times every night to check on them in order to protect these lambs. Once, the little lambs were crying because their mothers didn't have milk, Wu Genquan patiently fed them bean cake flour twice. He often said: "The sheep are the property of everyone, and the death of one is the loss of everyone." Wu Genquan also cares about the affairs of the whole cooperative. On this night, when he had just fed the lambs and lay down, he heard it was raining, and he hurriedly got up again and summoned several members, braving the rain to push the cooperative's two large carts to a place to shelter from the rain. Lin Dexuan, who drove the cart in the cooperative, was different from Wu Genquan, and did not cherish the cooperative's public property, often throwing large carts, whips, livestock harnesses, etc. around. We used Wu Genquan's example to educate all the members, asking everyone to learn from Wu Genquan, and criticizing Lin Dexuan's wrong behavior. Many members said with emotion: "Uncle Wu cares about everyone's property so much, it's really worth learning from."

During the education, I also paid attention to using my own practical actions to influence all the members. Also in March, when the sheep returned to the village, a ewe rolled from the hillside into the river. At this time, I happened to be seen, I quickly jumped into the water and rescued it. Ten days later, this ewe gave birth to a fat lamb. This was very educational for the members, and everyone said: "If the branch secretary didn't care about the property of the members, not only would a big sheep be lost, but also a small sheep would be lost." In this way, everyone paid more attention to cherishing the property of the cooperative.

However, it is not easy to get everyone to cherish the property of the cooperative as if it were their own. We must constantly educate the members and fight against the phenomenon of not cherishing the property of the cooperative. Once I found out that the breeder Li Degui always got up to feed the livestock very late, which not only delayed production, but also prevented the livestock from gaining weight. At this time, I used Wu Genquan's exemplary deeds of cherishing public property to educate him. Li Degui finally realized his mistake, and he said: "It's really wrong of me to do this, I must learn from Uncle Wu." Later, according to the needs of production, after discussion at the members' meeting, the work of raising livestock was changed to be undertaken by Lin Dehai, who had experience. Since Lin Dehai has been raising livestock, he has been feeding them on time and giving them water on time, without ever delaying production.

Now, under the education of the Party and the influence of advanced figures and advanced ideas, all the members of our cooperative are gradually establishing a new socialist morality of cherishing public property.

The cooperative belongs to everyone, and everyone must work together to grow more grain.
Zhang Guisheng, Secretary of the Nanwang Branch of the Communist Party of China, Tangyin County
Director of the Huoxing Agricultural Production Cooperative

After our cooperative was established in the winter of 1952, at that time, the idea of ​​each taking care of each other was still very serious among the members. Some members worked with the attitude of "work for one day, record one day's work", and did not care about the situation of the cooperative. After the wheat turned green last spring, it was time to topdress, but due to lack of funds, it was difficult to buy some fine fertilizer. Calling on members to invest, the members were afraid that if they invested money in the cooperative, they would not know when it would be returned. Those who had already invested livestock and farm tools in the cooperative were even more reluctant to take money out. Member Li Guanglu said: "There is no end to investing in the cooperative, no matter how much you put in, it will not be enough." Some members also believed that it would be more convenient to put the money at home than to invest in the cooperative.

We brought this issue to the branch committee for research. The research result decided to conduct ideological education for the members to improve the members' love for the cooperative. At the members' meeting, I explained to everyone that the cooperative is the home of the members. Whether our production will be good in the future and whether our lives can be improved depends on whether everyone can unite to run the cooperative. The difficulties of the whole cooperative are also the difficulties of each member, which require everyone to solve. If we invest money in the cooperative to buy fertilizer and land, on the one hand, we can grow more grain and distribute more dividends, and on the other hand, we can borrow less from the bank and free up national funds to build more factories and realize socialism as soon as possible. This is a way to improve everyone's lives and an act of patriotism, which is much better than putting money at home. At this time, I also gave everyone a simple calculation: Now the wheat is just about to conceive, and topdressing is the time to get the most out of it. If each mu of land is fertilized with 15 jin of fertilizer powder, which is equivalent to 20,000 yuan, 70 mu of land will cost only 1.4 million yuan; but with these fertilizers, it can grow more ears and more grains, and it is estimated that each mu can grow 40 jin of wheat more, and 70 mu can grow 2,800 jin of wheat more. What do you think is more cost-effective? After I said this, everyone discussed it again, and most of the members' thoughts were clear. Member Wang Tianri said: "The cooperative belongs to everyone. If you want to grow more grain, you have to work together!" Yu Chuntang also said: "Putting money into the cooperative is like putting it into the bank. It's useless to leave the money at home." At this time, I took the lead in reporting the 500,000 yuan of existing funds at home. Under my influence, Li Guanglu reported 300 jin of black beans, and Qiao Wenhua reported 370 jin of millet. We praised their exemplary behavior on the spot, encouraged the enthusiasm of all the members, and reported one after another. Through this members' meeting, a total of more than 3,000 jin of jade, corn, and black beans were reported, and more than 6 million yuan in cash. With these funds, we bought back 500 jin of fertilizer powder, 30 carts of manure, and 3,000 jin of bean cake, which solved the difficulty of topdressing. Through this education, the members have initially established the collective ideology of loving the cooperative.

However, there are still individual members who dare not invest boldly, and old middle peasant Qiao Wenhua is one of them. I thought that the members' thoughts could not be improved all at once, but had to be done gradually. In order to clear his mind, when I went to work in the field, I consciously went to a field with him to hoe cotton, and slowly guided him to recall the suffering life before liberation and compare it with the good life now. I told him that in the future, when a socialist society is built, life will be better, but if you want to live a better life, you must work together to run the cooperative well. Gradually, his thoughts were clear, and he decided to invest all his remaining funds in the cooperative.

This year, our cooperative has expanded from the original 11 households to 22 households. Because the branch has strengthened political education, the ideological awareness of the members has been greatly improved, and the collective ideology of loving the cooperative has been established. Most members say: "We must take the road to prosperity for everyone, not the road of capitalism."

    农村党组织要教育社员热爱农业生产合作社
    咱社出现了人人爱社，人人为社的新气象
    中共江油县德胜乡支部书记
    新华农业生产合作社社长  吴世平
    我们社是在今年二月建立的。由于支部在建社后放松了政治思想教育工作，领导干部又陷入了事务圈子里，社里的生产活动和经营管理很不好。这时我懂得了应该在社员中进行政治教育工作，但是由于自己没有这方面的经验，把政治教育工作当做只是讲大道理，它的效果当然不大。后来我体会到政治思想教育工作必须结合各项生产活动进行。
    社里划分了生产小组和建立分工负责制以后，出现了社员单纯挣工分不服从分配的现象。支部对这个问题作了研究，决定从两方面去解决，一方面通过具体事实讲明统一调配劳动力才能提高生产效率的道理；另一方面批判和纠正党员中不服从分配的现象，然后通过党员、团员和积极分子的模范行动去教育社员。这样做起了很大作用。比如党员缪洪志第一个带头去修埝，影响其他不愿去修埝的社员也都去了。青年团员吴世均为了使肥料不受损失，除了把自己保管的粪堆盖好外，还说服与帮助卢安贵、李永玉也去盖粪堆。在他们的影响下，从来不盖粪堆的缪长祥和缪发志等也把粪堆盖起来了。支部就抓住这些模范事例，发动社员讨论。这样的讨论对社员教育很大，大家都认识到了个人利益和社的利益是一致的，社员的每一行动都要为全社着想。由于社员觉悟的提高，不断地出现了许多劳动模范，树立了各方面的榜样，保证了生产计划的实行。
    为了使政治教育经常化，支部建议社务委员会建立了批评和自我批评制度，发动全体社员开展了群众性的检查工作，收效很大。如社员邓文中揭发了有人使小桶挑粪的现象，社务委员会就提到社员中去讨论，大家都认为这是图轻松、图挣工分的个人打算，对这种行为进行了批评。使用小桶挑粪的张才林，在会上自动作了检讨；江祥发、向世禄、卢大逊等也自动地换了大桶。对于个别落后的社员，我们便组织党员和积极分子经常地去帮助他们。这样做的结果，我们社开始出现了人人爱社，人人热心为社工作的新气象。
    爱护社的财产如像爱护自己的财产一样
    中共宽甸县双山子村支部书记
    美满农业生产合作社主任  刘玉田
    我们的农业生产合作社虽然才建立两三个月，但是已经出现了不少爱护公共财产的模范社员。为了使每一个社员都爱护社的财产，我们就用这些真人真事向社员进行教育。七十多岁的放羊工武根全，就是一个模范社员。三月，社里添了不少羊羔，武根全为了保护这些羊羔，每天夜里都要起来检查一两遍。有一次小羊羔因为母羊没奶，饿得“咩咩”乱叫，武根全就耐心地喂了两次豆饼面。他常说：“羊是大伙的财产，死一只就是大伙的损失。”武根全还关心全社的事情，就在这一天的夜里，当他喂饱了羊羔，刚刚躺下，听见天下雨了，又急急忙忙起来，招唤几个社员，冒着雨把社里的两台大车推到避雨的地方去。社里赶车的林德轩和武根全不一样，不爱护社里的公共财产，常常把大车、鞭子、牲口套等乱扔。我们就拿武根全的事例去教育全体社员，让大家学习武根全，并批判了林德轩的错误行为。许多社员都感动地说：“武大爷这样关心大伙的财产，真是值得咱们学习。”
    在进行教育时，我还注意用自己的实际行动来影响全体社员。也是三月里，羊群回村时，有一只母羊从山坡上滚到河里去了。这时，正好被我遇见，我就急忙跳下水去救了出来。十天后，这只母羊生了一只肥胖的小羊羔。这对社员的教育很大，大家都说：“要不是支部书记关心社员的财产，不光损失一只大羊，还会损失一只小羊。”这样大家更注意爱护社的财产了。
    但是，要大家把社里的财产当作自己的财产一样爱护，不是一件容易的事情，一定要不断的对社员进行教育，并向不爱护社里财产的现象作斗争。有一次我检查出饲养员李德贵每天都是天大亮了才起来喂牲口，不光耽误了生产，牲口也不能长膘。这时我就用武根全爱护公共财产的模范事迹来教育他。李德贵终于认识了自己的错误，他说：“我这样做真是太不对了，一定要向武大爷学习。”后来根据生产的需要，经过社员大会讨论，饲养牲口的工作改由有经验的林德海来担任。林德海饲养牲口以来，每天都是按时喂料，按时给牲口饮水，从没有耽误过生产。
    现在我们社的全体社员，在党的教育和先进人物先进思想的影响下，一步一步地在树立起爱护公共财产的社会主义的新道德。
  社是大家的，要大家齐动手才能多打粮食
    中共汤阴县南王支部书记
    火星农业生产合作社社长    张贵生
    我们社在一九五二年冬天建立以后，当时社员中，各顾各的思想还很严重，有些社员抱着“作一天活，记一天工”的态度来工作，对社里的情况不管不问。去年春天小麦返青后，正是需要上追肥的时候，但由于缺乏资金，想买一部分细肥就很困难。号召社员投资，社员怕把钱投到社里不知啥时候才还，已经把牲口农具入了社的更不愿再往外拿钱。社员李光禄就说：“往社里投资没边，有多少也填不满。”也有的社员认为：有钱投资入社不如放在家里方便。
    我们把这个问题提到支委会上去研究，研究结果，决定对社员进行思想教育，提高社员的爱社思想。在社员大会上，我向大家讲明社就是社员的家，今后咱们生产搞的好不好，生活能不能提高，就看大家能不能团结起来办社；全社的困难，也就是每个社员的困难，就需要大家来解决。咱们把钱投到社里买肥料上地，一来可以多打粮食多分红，二来可以少从银行里贷款，腾出国家资金来，建设更多的工厂，早日实现社会主义，这是改善大家生活的办法，又是爱国的行为，怎么也比把钱放在家里强。这时，我还给大家简单地算了一笔账：现在小麦正要?股怀胎，上追肥正是带劲的时候，如果每亩地上十五斤肥田粉，折合两万元来算，七十亩地不过花一百四十万元；可是加上这些肥料，就能多?股多结穗，估计每亩多打四十斤麦子，七十亩就能多打两千八百斤麦子。大家想想到底怎么样合算呢？经过我这样一讲，大家又讨论了一遍，大部分社员的思想通啦，社员王天日说：“社是大家的，要想多打粮食，就得齐动手才行哩！”于春堂也说：“钱入了社等于入了银行，把钱留在家里也是白放着。”这时，我首先带头把家里现存的五十万元报出来。在我的影响下，李光禄报出三百斤黑豆，乔文华报出三百七十斤小米。我们当场表扬了他们的模范行为，鼓舞了全体社员的情绪，接二连三的就报开啦。通过这次社员大会，一共报出玉茭、黑豆三千多斤，现款六百多万元。用这些资金买回肥田粉五百斤，粪肥三十车，豆饼三千斤，解决了上追肥的困难。通过这次教育，社员们初步树立了爱社的集体主义思想。
    但是还有个别社员还不敢大胆地投资，老中农乔文华就是其中的一个。我想，社员的思想不是一下子就能提高的，总得逐步地来。为了打通他的思想，下地做活时我就有意识地跟他到一块地里去锄棉花，从扯闲话慢慢引导他回忆起解放前的受苦生活，对比现在的好日子。我告诉他，将来建设成了社会主义社会，日子会过的更好，可是想要过更好的生活，现在就得同心协力把社办好。渐渐他的思想通了，决定要把全部余资投到社里。
    今年，我们社由原来的十一户扩大到二十二户，由于支部加强了政治教育工作，社员的思想觉悟已大大提高，树立了爱社的集体主义思想。大部分社员都说：“要走大家富裕的路，不走资本主义的路。”
