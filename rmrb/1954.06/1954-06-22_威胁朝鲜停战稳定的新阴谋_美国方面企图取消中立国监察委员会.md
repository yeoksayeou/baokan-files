    New Conspiracy Threatening the Stability of the Korean Armistice
    U.S. Side Attempts to Abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
    Xinhua News Agency, 21st - After the breakdown of the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, the U.S. authorities are intensifying the planning of a new conspiracy aimed at undermining the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and threatening the stability of the Korean armistice.
    Under the instigation of the U.S. authorities, Cho Jeong-hwan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, publicly stated on the 18th that the South Korean government would like the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to cease its monitoring and inspection activities in South Korea. Two days before this, Byun Young-tae, Minister of Foreign Affairs of South Korea, publicly stated in Geneva that the armistice agreement was invalid and that the South Korean government was not bound by any restrictions of the armistice agreement. The U.S. directing the Rhee Syngman group to issue this threat is clearly an attempt to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to recklessly violate the armistice agreement and transport a large amount of military reinforcement materials to South Korea. At the same time, this is also clearly related to the new conspiracy of the United States to obstruct the progress already made at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue.
    The facts have irrefutably proven that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has played a significant role in ensuring the stability of the Korean armistice and restricting the unbridled violation of the armistice agreement by the United States. The U.S. authorities have long carried out malicious attacks on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in order to remove this obstacle that restricts its violation of the armistice agreement. Now, after disrupting the Geneva Conference negotiations on the Korean issue, the U.S. authorities are attempting to openly use Rhee Syngman to undermine the clauses of the armistice agreement related to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure the stability of the Korean armistice and facilitate the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it is the duty of the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to safeguard the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its authority to perform its legitimate duties, and to oppose and thwart this serious conspiracy of the United States and Rhee Syngman to undermine the armistice agreement. If some members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission attempt to withdraw from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, then their actions will undoubtedly only encourage the destructive actions of the United States and Rhee Syngman, and have a detrimental impact on the implementation of the armistice agreement and the stability of the Korean armistice.
    It is quite clear that this new move by the U.S. authorities is extremely dangerous. If the provisions of the Korean armistice agreement regarding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are thereby undermined, the United States must bear the primary responsibility.

    威胁朝鲜停战稳定的新阴谋
    美国方面企图取消中立国监察委员会
    【新华社二十一日讯】美国当局在破裂日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判以后，正在加紧策划一个旨在破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会和威胁朝鲜停战的稳定的新阴谋。
    南朝鲜外务部副长官曹正焕十八日又在美国当局的授意下公开表示南朝鲜政府将要中立国监察委员会停止在南朝鲜的监察和视察活动。在这以前两天，南朝鲜外务部长官卞荣泰就已在日内瓦公开声称，停战协定已经无效，南朝鲜政府不受停战协定的任何约束。美国指挥李承晚集团发出这种威胁，显然是企图取消中立国监察委员会以便无所顾忌地违反停战协定，向南朝鲜运入大量军事增援性作战物资。同时，这也显然和美国阻挠在印度支那问题上已取得进展的日内瓦会议的新阴谋有关。
    事实已无可辩驳地证明：中立国监察委员会对保证朝鲜停战的稳定和限制美国肆无忌惮地违反停战协定起了很大的作用。美国当局长期以来对中立国监察委员会进行恶毒的攻击，就是为了要取消这个限制它违反停战协定的障碍。现在，美国当局在破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的谈判以后，就企图公开利用李承晚来破坏停战协定中有关中立国监察委员会的条款。因此，为了保证朝鲜停战的稳定，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决，作为中立国监察委员会的委员的职责应该是维护中立国监察委员会以及它执行合法职司的权力，反对和挫败美国以及李承晚的这种严重破坏停战协定的阴谋。中立国监察委员会有的委员如果企图退出中立国监察委员会，那么，他们的这种行动无疑只会使美国以及李承晚的破坏行动受到鼓励，使停战协定的实施和朝鲜停战的稳定受到有害的影响。
    十分明显，美国当局的这种新策动是十分危险的，朝鲜停战协定关于中立国监察委员会的规定如果因此遭受破坏，美国必须承担最主要的责任。
