Since the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Notice on Carrying Out Calisthenics and Other Sports Activities in Government Offices" in March this year, government offices in major regions, provinces, and cities across the country have widely carried out calisthenics and other sports activities.

According to statistics from directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, some organs of the Central People's Government, as well as first-level organs in North China, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northeast, and provincial-level organs in Jiangsu, Liaoxi, Guangdong, and Songjiang, the number of people who regularly participate in calisthenics has reached about 60 percent of the total number of people in the offices. Among them, 20 units directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, 42 first-level units of the Central People's Government, 25 units of the North China Administrative Committee, and 52 units of the Beijing Municipal People's Government have achieved more than 80 percent participation in calisthenics. Many units, such as the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Central South Cultural and Educational Committee, the East China Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, directly subordinate organs of Sichuan Province, and first-level organs of the Chongqing and Guangzhou Municipal People's Governments, and Shanghai Customs, have reached more than 90 percent. Although the Northwest Region has been lagging behind in this effort, some county-level organs have also begun to carry out calisthenics activities.

After the implementation of calisthenics in government offices, the interest of government cadres in participating in other sports activities has also greatly increased. Directly subordinate organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and directly subordinate organs of the Central People's Government have held competitions in table tennis, volleyball, and badminton. From mid-April to early May, directly subordinate organs of Hebei Province held ball games and gymnastics meets during holidays. The first sports meet for government staff in Tianjin, held in mid-May, was attended by 1,888 athletes. Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, held a county-level group broadcasting calisthenics competition on May 1st. As for holiday outings and various competitions within the organs, they are even more common and active. Government cadres in various places have reported that calisthenics and various sports activities not only enrich everyone's spare-time cultural life but also improve everyone's health.

    各地机关普遍开展工间操等体育活动
    自今年三月中央人民政府政务院发出“关于在政府机关中开展工间操和其他体育运动的通知”以来，全国各大区、省、市的机关普遍开展了体操及其他体育活动。
    据中共中央直属机关、中央人民政府部分机关，以及华北、华东、中南、西南、东北一级机关，江苏、辽西、广东、松江等省级机关的统计，经常参加工间操的人数，已达到机关总人数的百分之六十左右。其中中共中央直属二十个单位、中央人民政府一级的四十二个单位、华北行政委员会二十五个单位、北京市人民政府五十二个单位，做操人数达到百分之八十以上；有不少单位如中央燃料工业部、中南文委、青年团华东工委、四川省直属机关、重庆、广州市人民政府一级机关和上海海关等则已达到百分之九十以上。西北区虽然开展得较差，但也有一部分县级机关开展了工间操活动。
    机关的工间操开展以后，机关干部参加其他体育活动的兴趣也大大地提高了。中共中央直属机关、中央人民政府直属机关都曾举行了乒乓球、排球以及羽毛球竞赛。河北省直属机关在四月中到五月上旬，利用假日举行了球类、体操运动大会。天津市在五月中举行的第一届机关工作人员体育运动大会，参加的运动员有一千八百八十八名。浙江省宁海县在五月一日开了县级机关团体广播体操比赛大会。至于假日的郊游、机关内的各种竞赛活动，则更是普遍和活跃。各地机关干部都反映：工间操和各种体育活动，不仅丰富了大家的业余文化生活，而且提高了大家的健康水平。
