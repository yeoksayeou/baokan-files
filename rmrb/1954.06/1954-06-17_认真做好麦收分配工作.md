    Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Wheat Harvest Distribution
    Lan Cun
    It is now the wheat harvest season. In all wheat-harvesting areas, the members of agricultural producers' cooperatives are most concerned about how the wheat will be distributed. The peasant masses around the cooperatives also want to see whether the wheat is distributed well in the agricultural producers' cooperatives, in order to decide whether to join the cooperative after the autumn harvest. For the vast majority of agricultural producers' cooperatives that distribute once a year, wheat harvest distribution is only a pre-distribution or advance payment of the year's distribution, and one cannot see the full result of a member's labor for the year from this one distribution. However, most members rely on wheat to solve their food problems. Especially the large number of new members who joined the cooperative this year, they have not been in the cooperative for long, have not yet developed the habit of collective management, and have not personally experienced the benefits of the cooperative. Their ideological sentiments have not yet completely stabilized. When the wheat is about to ripen, the fear that the wheat will be distributed unfairly is a common concern of almost all new members. Some also want to measure the gains and losses of personal interests from the current good or bad wheat distribution, and decide their attitude towards the cooperative. For cooperatives that distribute twice a year, in the wheat and autumn seasons, the relationship between wheat harvest distribution and the interests of the members is even more important, and the members will be more concerned about this distribution. Therefore, whether this distribution work is done well is an important issue related to the continued consolidation and development of agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    According to materials from various regions, this year's wheat harvest distribution situation is quite complex, and there are many problems. Most of the original ten thousand or so old cooperatives have been expanded to varying degrees. In these cooperatives, there are old members and new members. The wheat fields of the old members were originally managed and distributed by the cooperative in a unified manner. However, most of the new members brought their wheat fields to the cooperative after the wheat was planted. After their wheat fields entered the cooperative, some were distributed by the cooperative in a unified manner, while others were planted and harvested by themselves. In the old cooperatives where new members planted and harvested their own wheat fields, most of the new members' wheat fields were processed and harvested by the cooperative in a unified manner after they joined the cooperative. This has created a special phenomenon in the cooperative where the wheat fields are managed in a unified manner, but there are two distribution methods. This raises questions such as how to calculate labor remuneration (because new members also work in the wheat fields of old members, and old members also work in the wheat fields of new members), how to evaluate the yield of wheat fields (because the yield of wheat stubble fields and spring fallow fields are different, and the wheat fields of new members and old members are also different), and how to calculate the distribution of wheat and autumn harvests. In the large number of new cooperatives that were established this year, the most important problem is a lack of experience. From the handling of wheat fields at the time of establishing the cooperative to the specific distribution after the wheat harvest, these are all new issues for them. In addition, many cooperatives were organized more hastily last winter and this spring in a relatively short period of time. After being organized, they were busy investing in spring plowing production, and a more appropriate plan was not determined for the handling of wheat fields, and the labor organization and labor accounting in spring plowing production were relatively chaotic, which further increased the difficulty of distribution work. Although most new cooperatives had regulations on the method of wheat field entry into the cooperative at the time of establishing the cooperative, some regulations were reasonable and some were unreasonable. If the regulations are unreasonable, problems will inevitably arise in the specific distribution, and even if the original regulations are reasonable, it cannot be said that there are completely no problems. For example, some members regretted it after seeing that their wheat was growing well after the wheat fields entered the cooperative, and felt that it would be more beneficial to plant and harvest by themselves, thus becoming shaken and wanting to withdraw from the cooperative. In addition to these problems, there are many other problems. In short, this year's wheat harvest distribution is an important and complex issue. If this work is not done well, it will affect the unity of new and old members, it will affect the relationship between poor and middle peasants, and as a result, it will affect the consolidation and development of the cooperative. Some comrades who lead rural work believe that the wheat harvest distribution problem is not big, and believe that "the method of handling wheat fields is already stipulated in the cooperative's charter, and it is enough to act in accordance with the charter." These are all views that do not understand the importance and complexity of the wheat harvest distribution problem, and these are all wrong.
    How can we do a good job in wheat harvest distribution? According to the experience of various regions last year, the most important thing is to conscientiously solve the various specific problems in the distribution. When solving these problems, we must proceed from the viewpoint of consolidating the unity of the middle and poor peasants, strengthening the unity of new and old members, and developing production, and solve them in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, so as to achieve fairness and reasonableness. In cooperatives where wheat fields are uniformly distributed by the cooperative, reasonable compensation should be given to new members for the labor, animal labor, and investment spent on planting wheat before joining the cooperative, and it should not be too high or too low. For the labor spent by new members before joining the cooperative, it can generally be recorded as labor days based on actual conditions, and unified remuneration can be obtained with the labor days obtained after joining the cooperative, with pre-distribution in the wheat season and settlement after the autumn harvest. The animal labor spent can be returned after the wheat harvest according to the price of hiring animal power by the cooperative and the actual quantity, the fertilizer can be returned according to the price of the cooperative buying fertilizer from members and the actual quantity, and the seeds can be returned according to the actual quantity invested. In cooperatives that adopt the method of who plants who harvests, the wheat owner should give reasonable remuneration to other members for the labor days invested in their own wheat fields. The amount of remuneration should be based on the amount of remuneration for labor days in the whole cooperative. The evaluation of the yield of wheat stubble fields that are uniformly used by the cooperative after the wheat harvest should be appropriately reduced. If it is not reduced, the cooperative should be compensated for a certain output (because the harvest amount of wheat stubble fields is lower than that of spring fallow fields). In the past, some cooperatives in the 15th district of Laixi County, Shandong Province, stipulated that wheat should be weeded and harvested for the wheat owner without compensation, and the wheat owner was given land remuneration according to the use of wheat land throughout the year. Some cooperatives gave the wheat owner land remuneration that was actually higher than that of spring fallow land. These are all practices that make labor suffer and actually damage the interests of poor peasants. In Henan, some cooperatives blindly increase labor remuneration, which will also make middle peasants with more wheat land suffer. Whether it is a cooperative where wheat land is uniformly distributed by the cooperative or a cooperative where who plants who harvests, appropriate care should be given to households in difficulty or households with less labor in the spring, and a certain amount of wheat should be distributed to them, which will be deducted from the total income of the year after the autumn. This can not only solve their current difficulties, but also encourage them to work hard. In cooperatives where the proportion of wheat harvest is small and distribution is once a year, wheat harvest distribution is only a pre-distribution or advance payment, and is not a formal distribution. However, the situation is different in cooperatives where the proportion of wheat harvest is very large and distribution is carried out twice a year. In these cooperatives, after leaving funds for next year's wheat field production and the reserve fund and public welfare fund that should be left, a formal distribution should be carried out according to the original proportion of labor and land distribution. In this way, if the original proportion of land and labor distribution in some cooperatives is unreasonable, it should be appropriately adjusted. In short, no matter what problem is dealt with in the distribution, the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be adhered to, and fairness and reasonableness should be achieved as much as possible. Some cooperatives, with the consent of the members, uniformly retain a portion of the wheat to sell to the state according to the members' possibilities and the needs of the state. This method is feasible. This is a concrete manifestation of the patriotic spirit of the members of agricultural producers' cooperatives in supporting the country's industrial construction.
    Because wheat harvest distribution is directly related to the current interests of the members, at this time, various individualistic thoughts of the peasants are most likely to grow, and they often only see personal interests and ignore collective interests, or only see current interests and ignore long-term interests. Under these circumstances, if political and ideological education is not strengthened at the same time, the distribution work will be difficult to do well. Therefore, in the process of distribution, we must always pay attention to educating the members through concrete facts to consolidate the unity of the middle and poor peasants, the unity of new and old members, implement voluntariness and mutual benefit, and develop production. Here, we must first criticize the egalitarianism of the peasants. At the same time, we must also criticize the idea and practice of valuing land and devaluing labor, inappropriately increasing land dividends, reducing labor remuneration, and not taking care of households in difficulty, which harms the interests of poor peasants. Members should understand that these ideas are not conducive to the unity of the middle and poor peasants, the unity of new and old members, and do not conform to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and therefore are not conducive to giving play to labor enthusiasm and developing production. As a result, it not only hinders the current interests of the middle and poor peasants, but also hinders the middle and poor peasants from forming a solid alliance to jointly build the long-term interests of socialism. For those members who have a lot of wheat land, who are shaken and want to withdraw from the cooperative because they see that their wheat is growing well and are afraid that their interests cannot be exclusively obtained, they should be educated to understand that they should not only calculate small accounts, but also calculate big accounts, and they should not only see current interests, but also see long-term interests. Only by combining their own interests with the interests of the cooperative can it be beneficial to both the cooperative and themselves. In addition, members should be educated on socialist industrialization and patriotism, and members should be mobilized to sell the surplus grain to the state in a timely manner after distribution to support the country's industrial construction.
    At present, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have completed the wheat harvest and have completed the distribution work. How is the distribution of these cooperatives? An inspection should be carried out. For those who are distributed reasonably and the members are basically satisfied, they should be organized to further do a good job in summer hoeing and summer planting, and strive to increase the autumn field production. For those who are distributed unreasonably, some major problems that must be solved should be resolved in combination with organizing them to carry out summer production, so that the members can settle down and actively produce. Regions that have not yet implemented the wheat harvest distribution should conscientiously do a good job in the wheat harvest distribution work while organizing the summer harvest and summer planting, so that the agricultural producers' cooperatives can be further consolidated and developed.

    认真做好麦收分配工作
    蓝村
    现在正是麦收季节。在各个收麦地区，农业生产合作社的社员们最关心的一件事，就是麦子怎样分配。合作社周围的农民群众，也要看看农业生产合作社的麦子分配得好不好，好决定自己秋后入不入社。对绝大多数一年分配一次的农业生产合作社说来，麦收分配虽然还只是全年分配当中的一次预分或预支，还不能从这一次分配看出一个社员一年劳动的全部成果，但多数社员要靠麦子来解决食用问题。特别是今年才入社的大量新社员，他们参加合作社不久，还没有养成集体经营的习惯，还没有亲身体验到合作社的好处，思想情绪也还没有完全安定下来；当麦子快要成熟的时候，怕麦子分配不公，几乎是所有新社员普遍顾虑的问题。有的也要从目前麦子分配的好坏来衡量个人利益的得失，决定自己对合作社的态度。对于一年麦秋两季分配两次的社来说，麦收分配和社员的利害关系更加重大，社员们对这次分配是会更加关心的。因此，这次分配工作做得好不好，是关系到农业生产合作社继续巩固和发展的一个重要问题。
    根据各地的材料来看，今年麦收分配的情况相当复杂，问题也很多。原有的一万多个老社大部分都不同程度地扩大了。在这种社里，一个社有老社员，有新社员，老社员的麦地原来是归社统一经营，统一分配的；而新社员大部分却是种麦以后才带着麦地入社的，他们的麦地入社以后，有的是归社统一分配，有的是自种自收。在新社员麦地自种自收的老社里，大部分社新社员的麦地入社以后，也是由社统一加工，统一收割。这就造成在一个社里，麦地是统一经营的，而分配方法却有两种的特殊现象。这里就发生了劳动报酬怎样计算（因为新社员也在老社员的麦地劳动，老社员也在新社员的麦地劳动）、麦地怎样评产（因为麦茬地和春白地的产量不一样，新社员和老社员的麦地也不一样）、麦收和秋收的分配怎样计算等问题。在今年才建起来的大批新社里，最主要的问题是没有经验。从组社时对麦田的处理到麦收后的具体分配，对它们来说都是新的问题。加上许多社是去冬今春在较短的时期内比较草率地组织起来的，一组织起来以后就忙着投入春耕生产，对麦田的处理没有定出比较妥善的方案，春耕生产中的劳动组织与劳动计工又比较混乱，这就更增加了分配工作的困难。大部分新社在建社时，对麦地入社办法虽然都有了规定，但规定得有合理的，也有不合理的。规定得不合理的，在具体分配的时候，必然会发生问题，就是原来规定得合理的也不能就说完全没有问题。如有的社员在麦地入社以后，看到自己的麦子长得很好，便又后悔了，觉着不如自种自收对自己更有利，因而发生动摇，想要退社。除去以上这些问题外，其他问题还很多。总而言之，今年的麦收分配是一个既重要又复杂的问题，如果不能把这个工作做好，就会影响新、老社员的团结，就会影响贫、中农的关系，结果就会影响到合作社的巩固和发展。有些领导农村工作的同志认为麦收分配问题不大，认为“麦田的处理办法在社章上已有规定，照章办事就行了”。这都是不了解麦收分配问题的重要性和复杂性的看法，这都是错误的。
    怎样才能做好麦收分配工作呢？根据去年各地的经验，最主要的是必须认真解决分配当中的各种具体问题。在解决这些问题的时候，要从巩固中贫农团结、加强新、老社员的团结和从发展生产的观点出发，按照自愿互利原则去加以解决，做到公平合理。在麦地统一归社分配的社里，对新社员在入社前种麦所费的人、畜工和投资要按照实际情况给予合理的补偿，不应过高或过低。对新社员入社前所费的人工，一般可以依实记成劳动日，与入社后所得劳动日统一取得报酬，麦季预分秋后结算。所费畜工可按照社雇用畜力的代价与实际数量，肥料按社收买社员肥料的价格与实际数量，种籽按实际投入的数量，在麦收以后归还。在采用谁种谁收办法的社里，麦主对其他社员在自己麦地上所投的劳动日应给予合理报酬。报酬多少应以全社劳动日的报酬多少为标准。收麦后归社统一使用的麦茬地的评产应予适当降低，不降低的应补给社一定产量（因麦茬地的收获量比春白地的产量低）。山东莱西县十五区有的社原来规定给麦主无代价地锄麦、割麦，并按全年使用麦地给麦主以土地报酬，有的社给麦主的麦地报酬实际上比春白地高，这都是使劳力吃亏，实际上是损害贫农利益的作法。河南有的社盲目提高劳动报酬，结果也会使麦地多的中农吃亏。无论是麦地归社统一分配或谁种谁收的社，对社内的困难户或春季劳动少的户都应该给予适当照顾，分给他们一定的麦子，等秋后再从一年的总收入中扣除。这样既可解决他们眼前的困难，又可以鼓励他们努力劳动。在麦收比重小一年分配一次的社里，麦收分配只是一次预分或预支，并不是正式分配。但在麦收比重很大一年进行两次分配的社里，情况就不同了。在这种社里，麦收分配要在留下来年麦田生产资金以及应留的公积金、公益金以后，按原定的劳力、土地分配比例进行正式分配。这样有的社如果原定的土地、劳力分配比例不合理，就应当适当加以调整。总之，无论处理分配中的什么问题，都要坚持自愿互利原则，尽量做到公平合理。有些社经过社员的同意，按照社员的可能和国家的需要，统一留下一部分麦子卖给国家，这种办法是可行的，这是农业生产合作社社员一种模范的支援国家工业建设的爱国的具体表现。
    因为麦收分配直接关系着社员的当前利益，在这种时候，农民的各种个人主义思想最容易滋长起来，他们常常会只看到个人利益而忽视集体利益，或者只看到目前利益而忽视长远利益。在这种情况下，如果不同时加强政治思想教育，分配工作也是难以做好的。因此，在分配的过程中，要时刻注意通过具体事实，对社员进行巩固中、贫农团结、新老社员团结、贯彻自愿互利和发展生产的教育。这里，首先要批判农民的平均主义思想。同时，也要批判那种重土地、轻劳力，不适当地提高土地分益，降低劳动报酬和对困难户不加照顾的损害贫农利益的思想和作法。应该使社员懂得：这些思想都是不利于中贫农团结、新老社员团结，不合乎自愿互利原则的，因而也是不利于发挥劳动积极性和发展生产的。结果不仅妨碍中、贫农的眼前利益，同时也妨碍中、贫农结成巩固联盟，共同建设社会主义的长远利益。对于那些麦地多，因看到自己的麦子长得好，怕利益不能独得而动摇想退社的社员，要教育他们懂得不要光算小账，还要算一算大账，不仅要看到眼前利益，还要看到长远利益，只有把自己的利益和社的利益结合起来，对社对自己才都有好处。此外，还应向社员进行社会主义工业化的教育，爱国主义教育，动员社员分配后，及时把余粮卖给国家，支援国家的工业建设。
    目前有不少农业生产合作社的麦子已收割完毕，并已完成了分配工作。这些社究竟分配得怎样？应该进行一次检查。对那些分配得合理、社员基本满意的，应组织他们进一步做好夏锄、夏种的工作，争取秋田多增产。对那些分配得不合理的，应该在结合组织它们进行夏季生产中，解决必须解决的一些主要问题，使社员安下心来积极生产。还没有实行麦收分配的地区，应该在组织夏收、夏种的同时，认真做好麦收分配工作，使农业生产合作社得到进一步的巩固和发展。
