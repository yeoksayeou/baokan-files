[Text] To further the ongoing technical innovation movement, workers in numerous factories and enterprises are adopting a focus on key production aspects and paying attention to collective creation.

Twenty-one renowned labor models and advanced producers from eighteen units in Shanxi Province, including steel, machinery, electrical, railway, coal mining, construction, and textile industries, have actively responded to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. They are committed to taking the nine goals proposed by Zhang Mingshan and six others as their common direction for effort. They will drive the broad masses of workers to push the current technical innovation movement in the province to a climax. They have also jointly proposed guarantee conditions. In Hebei Province, industrial labor models Liu Xizhen, Wu Lingjie, and eight others in Shijiazhuang City have also put forward five guarantee conditions for further carrying out technical innovations, striving to realize one or more technical innovations by themselves or with the help of the masses before the end of the year. The Harbin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened a symposium of advanced producers and organized trade union cadres to study and discuss the decision of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Recently, it also held a basic construction technology innovation exhibition to actively promote the participation of basic construction workers in the technical innovation movement. Industrial labor models in Jilin Province also held a symposium recently to respond to the call to carry out the technical innovation movement. The Qingdao Municipal Light Industry Trade Union in Shandong held its third member representative conference at the end of May, deciding to vigorously carry out the technical innovation movement in the light industry system. At the meeting, many member representatives put forward action plans for the future. Huangshi City convened a meeting of representatives of advanced producers in steel, coal mining, electrical, cement, and construction on June 4th, adopting four decisions to further deepen the technical innovation movement.

To enable the technical innovation movement to be carried out in a more planned and effective manner, many factories and mines have taken specific measures, especially focusing on the key aspects of production to propose technical innovation topics. Many state-owned and local state-owned factories in Taiyuan City have proposed technical innovation topics to workers, focusing on the weak links in production. For example, after the Shanxi Machinery Factory announced five major topics related to the trial production of new products and overcoming weak links on May 23rd, the factory's employees submitted seventy-eight rationalization proposals within a week, finding solutions to the five major topics. The Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is carrying out a technical innovation movement centered on solving the difficult problems in the trial production of new products. To solve the difficulties in the trial production of new products, the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant established a technical innovation school, absorbing veteran technicians, technical personnel, advanced producers, and relevant personnel to participate in special discussions on how to solve these difficulties during after-work hours. After discussing preliminary solutions, they took them to various workshops for experimentation and improvement, thus solving many difficulties. The rolling mill workshop of Daye Steel Plant recently doubled the number of its original technical innovation "special research groups" to further promote the technical innovation movement. At the same time, the Communist Youth League branch organized a "Wang Chonglun deeds lecture." The state-owned Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory is organizing a ranking of key production processes and manual labor tasks, preparing to guide workers to carry out technical innovation labor competitions in a more planned way. The technical innovation movements in Chongqing State-owned 101 Steel Plant and other factories are also focusing on key issues in production. To solve the problem of changing manual charging to mechanical charging, the iron smelting plant of the State-owned 101 Steel Plant proposed two topics: "Mechanization of charging" and "Mechanization of carbon tamping", guiding the masses of workers to actively put forward rationalization proposals for these two topics. Now, the charging machine and carbon tamping machine that mechanize the charging after the furnace have been designed and are being applied for manufacturing.

Many factories and mines are drawing on the experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's technical innovation movement and are actively rectifying rationalization proposal work and improving the system of implementing Soviet expert suggestions. The North China Coal Mine Administration recently convened a North China State-owned Coal Mine Mechanical and Electrical Technology Measures Organization Conference, formulated a plan for implementing Soviet expert suggestions, and arranged for the mechanical and electrical technology innovation work for the second half of the year. In rectifying rationalization proposal organizations, various factories and mines in Shanxi Province have absorbed engineering and technical personnel and veteran workers to participate. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, Shanxi Machinery Plant, Datong Mining Bureau, and Datong Power Plant have also established rationalization proposal sub-committees, technical research groups, or technical innovation topic research groups in each workshop, including workshop leaders, technicians, and veteran workers.

Many industrial and mining enterprises pay attention to collective creation in the technical innovation movement, and examples of close cooperation between workers and technical personnel have been constantly emerging. In the Taiyuan City factories and mines, more than one hundred important technical innovations have almost all been successfully researched by experienced technicians and engineering technical personnel together. For example, after Li Chunyuan, a technician from the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, proposed the suggestion of mechanizing the transportation of raw materials, he formed a design and construction team with engineer Wang Zhilun, technician Xue Shengwen, foreman He Fushou and Yang Ruguang, and others to jointly draw up blueprints and lead the construction. During the construction process, more than 800 employees automatically participated in the work in their spare time. After the Yangquan Mining Bureau proposed the topic of further improving the efficiency of coal loading, Liu Xingcai and Zhang Qingming, mechanical and electrical workers of the Second Mine, first proposed the suggestion of creating an automatic coal chute loader. However, this suggestion was not complete enough, so Zhang Yonghe, the head of the mechanical and electrical section, and technician Zhou Shouchang put forward supplementary opinions. Later, Chen Dao, a technician from the Mechanical and Electrical Department of the Mining Bureau, supplemented the opinions put forward by Zhang Yonghe and others, making the machine finally successfully created and put into production. Many technical personnel from the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau humbly studied and proposed rationalization proposals with workers. For example, the rationalization proposals collectively proposed by the power plant of the mine accounted for 40.3% of the rationalization proposals of the plant. The Shandong Pesticide Factory established a working group including the factory director, engineers, technicians, and management personnel to go deep into the workshops and combine with workers, and actively launched a mass technical innovation movement throughout the factory.

    围绕生产关键、注意集体创造
    许多厂矿深入开展技术革新运动
   【本报讯】许多厂矿、企业的职工进一步开展技术革新运动。
    山西省钢铁、机器、电业、铁路、煤矿、建筑、纺织等十八个单位的二十一名著名劳动模范和先进生产者积极响应全国总工会的号召，并愿以张明山等七人所提出的九项奋斗目标作为他们共同努力的方向，带动广大职工群众，把目前全省正在开展着的技术革新运动推向高潮，他们并共同提出了保证条件。河北省石家庄市工业劳动模范刘喜振、武苓姐等十人，也提出了进一步开展技术革新的五项保证条件，争取在年底以前，每人自己或帮助群众实现一件以上的技术革新。哈尔滨市工会联合会召集先进生产者举行座谈会，并组织工会干部学习和讨论了全国总工会的决定；最近，又举办了基本建设技术革新展览会，以积极推动基本建设职工参加技术革新运动。吉林省工业劳动模范也在最近开了座谈会，响应开展技术革新运动的号召。山东青岛市轻工业工会在五月底举行第三届会员代表大会，决定在轻工业系统大力开展技术革新运动，会上，有不少会员代表提出了今后的行动计划。黄石市在六月四日召开了钢铁、煤矿、电气、水泥、建筑等方面的先进生产者代表会议，通过了进一步深入开展技术革新运动的四项决定。
    为了使技术革新运动能够更有计划地更有成效地开展，许多厂矿采取了具体的措施，特别是针对生产中的关键，提出技术革新的课题。太原市许多国营和地方国营工厂都针对生产中的薄弱环节，向职工们提出了技术革新课题。如山西机器厂在五月二十三日公布了有关新产品试制和克服薄弱环节的五大课题以后，在一个星期内全厂职工就提出七十八件合理化建议，找到了解决五大课题的办法。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂以解决试制新产品中的困难问题为中心开展技术革新运动。为了解决试制新产品的困难，齐齐哈尔第一机床厂成立了一个技术革新学校，吸收老技术工人、技术人员、先进生产者及有关人员参加，利用工余时间专门讨论如何解决这些困难。他们在讨论出初步办法后，又拿到各车间去实验和改进，因而使得许多困难都得到解决。大冶钢厂轧钢车间最近为了把技术革新运动继续推向前进，已经把原有的技术革新“专业研究小组”的人数扩大了一倍半，同时还以青年团支部为主，举办了“王崇伦事迹讲座”。国营青岛四方机车车辆制造厂正组织进行生产关键排队、手工活排队，准备引导工人更有计划地展开技术革新劳动竞赛。重庆国营一零一钢铁厂等工厂的技术革新运动也围绕着生产中的关键问题进行。国营一零一钢铁厂炼铁场为解决把手工上料改变为机械上料的问题，提出了“上料机械化”和“打炭机械化”等两个课题，引导职工群众针对这两个课题积极提出合理化建议。现在，使炉后上料机械化的撮料机和打炭机已设计出来，正在申请制造中。
    许多厂矿吸取鞍钢技术革新运动的经验，正积极整顿合理化建议的工作和健全贯彻苏联专家建议的制度。华北煤矿管理局最近召开了华北国营煤矿机电技术措施组织会议，制定了执行苏联专家建议的方案，布置了下半年机电技术革新工作。山西省各厂矿在整顿合理化建议组织时，都吸收了工程技术人员和老工人参加。太原钢铁厂、太原机车车辆修理厂、山西机器厂、大同矿务局和大同发电厂等，还在各车间成立了包括车间领导干部、技术人员和老工人参加的合理化建议分会、技术研究组或技术革新课题研究组。
    许多工矿企业在技术革新运动中注意集体创造，工人和技术人员密切合作的事例已不断出现，太原市各厂矿有一百多件重要的技术革新几乎全部是经过有经验的技术工人和工程技术人员共同研究成功的。如太原钢铁厂炼钢部技师李春元提出原料装运机械化的建议后，就和工程师王之伦、技术员薛生文、工长贺福寿和杨如光等组成设计施工小组，共同绘制蓝图和领导施工，施工中并有八百多职工自动在业余时间参加工作。阳泉矿务局提出进一步提高煤炭装车效率的课题后，二矿机电工人刘兴才、张庆明等首先提出创造自动煤溜装车机的建议，但是这个建议不够完整，机电科长张永和和技术员周寿昌就提出补充意见。以后，矿务局机电处技术员陈道又补充张永和等提出的意见，使这部机器终于创造成功并投入生产。焦作矿务局的不少技术人员虚心地和工人共同研究提出合理化建议。如该矿发电厂集体提出的合理化建议，达这个厂合理化建议的百分之四十点三。山东农药厂成立了包括厂长、工程师、技术员和管理人员的工作组深入车间和工人结合，积极在全厂展开群众性的技术革新运动。
