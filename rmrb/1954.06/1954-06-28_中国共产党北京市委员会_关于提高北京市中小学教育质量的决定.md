    Decision of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary School Education in Beijing
    (Adopted on June 23, 1954)
    Since liberation, primary and secondary education in Beijing has greatly developed. There are currently over 81,000 middle school students, representing 203 percent of the total number of middle school students in Beijing in 1949; there are currently over 277,000 primary school students, representing 195 percent of the total number of primary school students in Beijing in 1949. The proportion of children of workers and peasants among students has greatly increased. Children of workers, peasants, and state employees now account for 72 percent of middle school students and 75 percent of primary school students. Many reforms have also been carried out in teaching content and teaching methods. Party and Communist Youth League organizations have been established and have developed considerably in middle schools and some primary schools; the political awareness of teachers and students has significantly improved. On this basis, leading cadres of some schools have begun to focus on teaching; some schools, by summarizing their own experiences and learning from Soviet experience, have achieved considerable success in improving teaching; and a small number of middle and primary schools are run relatively well.
    However, there are still many serious shortcomings and problems in the current work of primary and secondary education. The main problem is that the quality of education in many schools is very poor, and students' academic performance is not good. In 1953, the average score of high school graduates in the city who applied to universities was failing (i.e., less than 60 points), accounting for 70 percent of the total number of applicants. Among the 44 complete middle schools, only seven former public middle schools had a total average score of over 60 points for applicants; the total average scores of the remaining 37 middle schools were all less than 60 points, and the total average scores of seven schools were even less than 40 points. The performance of elementary school graduates applying to junior high school in 1953 was also poor, with the number of applicants with failing average scores accounting for 51 percent of the total number of applicants. In addition, many students despise physical labor and working people; some students do not abide by study discipline; and a small number of students, influenced by reactionary elements mixed in among teachers and the poisonous influence of the old society, have confused ideas and even engage in illegal activities.
    There are many reasons for the poor quality of education. For example, since the July 7th Incident, the quality of primary and secondary education in Beijing under Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule has generally been very low, and there has not yet been time to systematically improve it since liberation. Since liberation, primary and secondary education in Beijing has developed rapidly, and there has been no reliable source of teachers. Teachers recruited from unemployed intellectuals in the past account for 43 percent of the total number of primary and secondary school teachers. Many of them have considerable professional skills and are competent in their work, but some have very poor professional abilities and are incompetent in their work. Among the existing middle schools, many were originally private middle schools. Some of them originally had a good foundation, but most of them originally had a very poor foundation, and it is certainly difficult to generally improve quality in a short period of time. However, the most important reason is that the party and government departments in charge have not paid enough attention to the quality of education in the past and have not taken effective measures to improve quality while developing the number of schools. The phenomenon of busyness and confusion among principals and teachers caused by excessive extracurricular activities has not been thoroughly overcome. Educational administrative departments have not effectively and systematically placed the focus of leadership work on teaching work: leadership over teaching work is very weak; there is a lack of long-term plans and effective measures for the training and improvement of teachers, a lack of strict selection and necessary training when hiring new teachers, a lack of strict assessment of teachers' teaching work, a lack of due rewards for teachers with excellent work, and a lack of serious handling of teachers who are extremely irresponsible or even ideologically reactionary and morally bad; there is a lack of strict standards and systems for students' admission, promotion, and graduation, insufficient political and ideological education for students, especially labor education, and a failure to seriously deal with students who seriously disrupt school discipline and repeatedly fail to mend their ways, and even engage in illegal activities. It must be pointed out that the main reason why the above shortcomings have not been overcome for a long time is that although the Municipal Party Committee has repeatedly put forward some principled instructions and requirements for primary and secondary education, it has long lacked systematic research and strict supervision and inspection. These shortcomings and problems must be overcome and resolved quickly.
    The number of primary and secondary schools in Beijing will continue to increase in the future. We should formulate plans for the development of primary and secondary schools realistically based on needs and possibilities. In formulating plans and in actual work, we must attach equal importance to improving quality and developing quantity. Quantity should be developed on the principle of ensuring quality, and at present, we should first focus on improving the quality of education. We must recognize that in the struggle to realize the general task of the transition period, the Party and the state require schools at all levels to train qualified personnel, not "talents" who are merely nominal. If the quality of primary and secondary education is not improved, the result will inevitably affect the quality of higher education and the quality of reserve labor forces, bringing great losses to the cause of national socialist construction and socialist transformation. Party organizations and leading Party cadres in educational administrative departments at all levels and in schools should promote and help the administration to focus on leading teaching work and quickly take effective measures to generally improve the quality of education, so that the vast majority of students cultivated by each school can be qualified, and run a number of key schools well.
    In order to achieve this goal, we believe that the following work must be carried out:
    I. It is imperative to make the work of improving the quality of education a goal for the joint efforts of the vast number of teachers and students in schools. The Municipal Education Bureau should formulate a longer-term overall plan for improving the quality of education and developing primary and secondary schools, in order to further realize it in a planned way. Each school should formulate semester and academic year plans for gradually improving the quality of education, and put forward clear requirements for improving students' academic performance based on the actual situation of teaching. Teachers in charge of each major course should formulate plans to improve the quality of education in their respective courses, and homeroom teachers of each class should also formulate plans to improve the quality of education in their respective classes. Finally, the school's plan should be discussed and formulated by the school affairs meeting. From the upper grades of primary school, the plans formulated by the teachers of each major course should be announced to the students. The formulation of plans must be practical and feasible, and it is necessary to prevent greed for quantity and speed, resulting in neglecting quality or making the plans unable to be realized. Improving the quality of education mainly depends on improving the political and ideological level and professional level of teachers, improving teaching content and teaching methods, and improving students' enthusiasm for learning, so that students can obtain better academic performance under normal learning conditions. In order to improve students' academic performance, students must study hard in class and during self-study. However, principals and teachers must pay close attention to ensuring that students have appropriate entertainment, sports, and rest time to ensure and improve students' health, and oppose inappropriately increasing students' academic burden. Examination scores in each school should be real, ensuring that they fully conform to students' actual academic performance.
    II. The key to improving the quality of education at present is to guide teachers to deeply study textbooks and teaching outlines, understand and master the teaching objectives, ideological content, and scientific content of the subjects they teach, and improve teaching methods, so that teachers can correctly and systematically improve teaching work. In order to do this work well, educational administrative departments at all levels should effectively provide systematic and specific assistance to teachers in each school. At present, the main task is to organize and lead experienced teachers and staff to study and improve teaching with collective wisdom and effort, compile teaching guidance and reference materials, print and distribute them to relevant teachers in each school as they are compiled, use them while soliciting opinions from all sides to modify them in a timely manner, exchange advanced experiences, reduce the burden on teachers in preparing lessons, and improve their teaching ability. For teachers engaged in this writing work, their original teaching burden should be reduced.
    In order to continuously improve the quality of education, it is necessary to strengthen teachers' professional study and political study. For teachers with poor professional skills and difficulties in lecturing, they should improve their basic knowledge of their undergraduate studies through spare-time or off-the-job study, and require them to reach a certain professional level within a certain time limit to become competent teachers. The remaining teachers should also study systematic professional knowledge according to the different needs of the subjects they teach. In order to ensure that teachers have enough spare time for further study, the number of teachers' part-time jobs and non-teaching activities should be resolutely reduced. In order to strengthen the leadership of teachers' professional training, the existing teacher training colleges and teacher training schools should be improved and expanded. For teachers' political theory study, a relatively long-term systematic study plan should be formulated according to the situation of primary and secondary school teachers, strengthen leadership, and improve quality.
    The improvement of the quality of education must be based on the improvement of teachers' ideological awareness. According to the Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, teachers' ideological education should be strengthened through regular teaching work and political theory study, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out. At present, in addition to continuing to eliminate the residual influence of feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, it is necessary to focus on systematically criticizing and overcoming bourgeois ideas among teachers.
    In order to have enough qualified teachers for the future development of primary and secondary schools, the work of training teachers should be strengthened. In the future, new teachers should be strictly reviewed and carefully trained.
    III. There should be a systematic assessment of teachers' work, and teachers' work performance should be evaluated based on the quality of students' performance and the speed of progress. For those with excellent performance, attention should be paid to cultivating and improving them, so that they can play a leading and exemplary role in improving teaching work, and they should be rewarded and gradually and appropriately increase their salary and treatment; for those with poor performance, they should be helped to improve, and if they still cannot be qualified after being helped and improved, they should be dismissed or allowed to transfer to another industry; those who are ideologically reactionary and morally bad should be investigated and dealt with seriously, and they must not be tolerated and condoned without principle, which would mislead our education of the next generation.
    Gradually change the egalitarian phenomenon in the wage system. Distribution according to work is a socialist principle, and teachers should be given the salary and treatment they deserve based on their work performance. For teachers who edit teaching guidance and reference materials and teachers who are also teaching and research group leaders or homeroom teachers, they should be given appropriate remuneration in addition to their original salary.
    Respect for teachers should be advocated among students, and the important role of teachers in national construction should be publicized among the people, in order to improve the social status of teachers and increase teachers' enthusiasm for serving the people. Government departments in charge and relevant mass organizations should provide appropriate solutions to the difficult problems and welfare problems of teachers, especially female teachers, as much as possible.
    IV. Implement an all-round development of education, so that students can truly achieve "good health, good study, and good work." Educate students to deeply understand the purpose of learning, give full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of learning, and study hard. Resolutely change the current phenomenon of lax assessment of students' performance and inconsistent and too low standards for admission, promotion, and graduation. In the future, there must be strict standards for admission, promotion, and graduation. Students with excellent academic performance and conduct should be given appropriate spiritual and material rewards. The standards for assessing performance must be unified, and a unified examination system should be implemented step by step from the fourth grade of elementary school. The subjects for unified examination should be Chinese and arithmetic in primary schools, and in addition to Chinese and mathematics, other major courses should be appropriately added in middle schools.
    Strengthen political and ideological education for students. At present, it is especially necessary to strengthen labor education to overcome the influence of the exploiting class thinking of despising physical labor and working people among students. Strengthen conscious discipline education, implement student rules, and enable students to develop both a lively and creative spirit and a habit of abiding by discipline. Students who do not abide by discipline should be patiently persuaded and educated; those who repeatedly fail to mend their ways should be given appropriate punishment (but students must not be physically punished); those who are of very bad character and engage in illegal activities should be dealt with as necessary. It must be noted that only by effectively improving classroom teaching and strengthening the guidance of extracurricular activities can the work of rectifying student discipline be fully effective. Strengthening students' political and ideological education is mainly carried out through political classes and the teaching of other courses; at the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the work of homeroom teachers and the work of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers.
    Appropriate extracurricular activities that are beneficial to learning and can enrich and expand the field of knowledge should be carried out among students. Cultural and sports activities must be strengthened to improve students' physical and mental health. Some schools have too many student club activities, which should be appropriately reduced to avoid affecting students' learning of their lessons.
    V. Leading cadres of the Municipal Education Bureau, district cultural and education bureaus, and schools should earnestly study education business and truly become experts in the business in name and in fact; they must quickly and persistently put their main energy into teaching research and teaching leadership, systematically summarize experience, learn from advanced Soviet experience, exchange and promote the advanced experience of schools and model teachers with excellent performance, learn and promote the advanced experience of other regions, and effectively improve teaching. The Municipal Education Bureau should establish a special agency or person to be responsible for managing teaching research and teaching guidance work. Educational administrative departments should strengthen inspection work and regularly and systematically check and help schools improve teaching. Several key schools should be carefully run in a planned way to continuously gain new experience. Schools with very poor teaching performance should be rectified in stages and batches. Schools that lack the necessary books, instruments, and equipment for teaching should be appropriately supplemented.
    The main reason why principals and teachers are busy and confused is that the leading organs of the Party, government, and people's organizations at the municipal and district levels deploy work to schools in multiple ways without distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and the Municipal Party Committee lacks unified planning and adjustment, which leads to excessive burdens on principals and teachers outside of teaching. In order to ensure the improvement of the quality of education, it is necessary to effectively reduce the various complicated affairs outside of teaching for principals and teachers, and appropriately increase administrative cadres in schools with a large number of students to assist the principals in handling administrative affairs, so that the principals can concentrate on strengthening the leadership of teaching work, and the teachers can concentrate on improving teaching work. The main assistants to the principal in leading teaching are the teaching director, teaching and research group leader, and homeroom teacher. The work of teaching and research groups should be continuously improved to give full play to the collective mutual assistance of teachers; the leaders of each subject teaching and research group should be guaranteed the necessary time to conduct research work. The work of homeroom teachers should be helped and checked at any time, and the learning effect of students should be improved through the work of homeroom teachers.
    In order to strengthen leadership, the flow of education administrative department and school cadres and teachers should be reduced as much as possible in order to accumulate teaching experience.
    VI. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over education, the Municipal Party Committee should establish an education department. The Party's work in schools must be strengthened, and the Party organization must effectively play the role of ensuring teaching. Excellent teachers with considerable political awareness should be actively cultivated to become Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in order to change the weak state of the Party and the Communist Youth League in primary and secondary schools.
    Improving the quality of education is an extremely important task in school education at present, and it is also an arduous and complex task. In this work, a positive and steady approach must be adopted. On the one hand, the shortcomings and errors in the work must be overcome with a spirit of self-criticism, and the complacent mood of "it's almost there" must be overcome, and constantly demand ourselves with the standards that a people's democratic country led by the working class should have, and actively improve our work; on the other hand, we must move forward steadily, and prevent inappropriate tendencies in the work that may increase the academic burden on teachers and students, hinder the health of teachers and students, etc.
    Party organizations in educational administrative departments at all levels and in each school, Party groups of district Party committees, education trade unions, and relevant Communist Youth League organizations should seriously discuss and implement the above decision.

    中国共产党北京市委员会
    关于提高北京市中小学教育质量的决定
    （一九五四年六月二十三日通过）
    解放以来，北京市的中、小学教育有很大的发展。中学现有学生八万一千余人，为一九四九年本市中学生总数的百分之二百零三；小学现有学生二十七万七千余人，为一九四九年本市小学生总数的百分之一百九十五。学生中工农子女的比重有很大的增加，工人、农民和国家工作人员的子女，在中学生中现占百分之七十二，在小学生中现占百分之七十五。教学内容和教学方法也进行了许多的改革。在中学和部分小学中已经建立起党和团的组织并且有了相当的发展；教师和学生的政治觉悟已经有显著的提高。在这个基础上，部分学校的领导干部已经开始抓紧教学；有些学校由于总结了自己的经验，学习了苏联的经验，在改进教学方面已经取得了相当成绩；并且有少数中、小学办得较好。
    但是，目前中、小学教育工作中还存在很多严重的缺点和问题，主要是有很多学校的教育质量很差，学生的学习成绩不好。一九五三年全市高中毕业生投考高等学校，平均成绩不及格（即不到六十分）的人数竟占投考学生总数的百分之七十，在四十四个完全中学中，只有七个原来的公立中学投考学生的总平均成绩在六十分以上；其余三十七个中学总平均成绩都不到六十分，其中有七校总平均成绩甚至不到四十分。一九五三年高小毕业生投考初中的成绩也不好，平均成绩不及格的人数占投考学生总数的百分之五十一。此外，还有不少学生鄙视体力劳动，鄙视劳动人民；有些学生不遵守学习纪律；有少数学生因受了混入教师中的反动分子和旧社会污毒的影响，思想很混乱，甚至有违法行为。
    教育质量之所以很差，固然有很多原因，如自七七事变以后在日伪和国民党反动统治时期，北京市中、小学教育的质量一般很低，解放以后尚未来得及系统地予以提高；解放以后，北京市中、小学教育发展很快，师资没有可靠来源，从过去失业的知识分子中吸收的教师，占中、小学教师总人数的百分之四十三，其中有很多是有相当业务水平、工作称职的，但也有一部分是业务能力很差、工作不称职的；在现有中学中又有不少学校原来是私立中学，其中有一部分原来基础尚好，但大部分原来的基础很差，要在短期间普遍地提高质量确有一定的困难。但最主要的原因是党和政府的主管部门过去对于教育质量重视得不够，没有在发展学校数量的同时采取切实有效的措施来提高质量。对于校长和教师因课外活动过多所造成的忙乱现象，未能彻底克服。教育行政部门没有切实地、系统地把领导工作的重点放到教学工作上：对教学工作的领导很薄弱；对教师的培养和提高缺乏长期的计划和有效的措施，在聘用新教师时缺乏严格的选择和必要的训练，对教师的教学工作缺乏严格的考核，对工作优良的教师缺少应有的奖励，对工作极不负责甚至思想反动的和品质恶劣的教师缺乏严肃的处理；对学生入学、升级和毕业都缺乏严格的标准和制度，对学生的政治思想教育、特别是劳动教育进行得不够，对严重破坏学校纪律而屡教不改的甚至有违法行为的学生也没有认真地加以处理。必须指出：上述缺点之所以在长时期内未能克服，主要是由于市委对中、小学教育工作虽然也曾多次提出过一些原则的指示和要求，但却长期缺乏系统的研究和严格的监督与检查。这些缺点和问题必须迅予克服和解决。
    北京市中、小学的数量今后还将不断增加，我们应根据需要与可能，实事求是地制定中、小学的发展计划。在制定计划和实际工作中必须把提高质量与发展数量同等重视，应在保证质量的原则下发展数量，目前应首先抓紧提高教育质量。必须认识：在实现过渡时期总任务的斗争中，党和国家要求各级学校培养出合乎规格的人才，并不需要培养有名无实的“人才”；如果中、小学教育质量不提高一步，其结果就必然会影响高等学校的教育质量和劳动后备力量的质量，给国家社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业带来极大的损失。各级教育行政部门及学校中的党的组织和党员领导干部，应推动并帮助行政抓紧教学工作的领导，迅速采取切实有效的措施，以普遍地提高教育质量，使各学校培养出来的学生绝大部分都能合格，并办好一批重点学校。
    为了达到这个目的，我们认为必须进行下列工作：
    一、必须使提高教育质量的工作成为学校中广大师生共同努力奋斗的目标。市教育局应制定较长期的提高教育质量和发展中、小学的总的计划，以便进一步地来有计划地实现。各学校应订出逐步提高教育质量的学期和学年计划，并根据教学的实际情况，提出提高学生学习成绩的明确的要求。担任各门主要课程的教师应订出提高本门课程教育质量的计划，各班班主任也应订出本班提高教育质量的计划。最后经过校务会议讨论订出全校的计划。从小学高年级起，各主要课程的教师制定的计划应向学生宣布。制定计划，必须切实可行，要防止贪多图快，致忽视质量或使所订计划不能实现。提高教育质量，主要是靠提高教师的政治思想水平和业务水平、改善教学内容和教学方法、提高学生的学习积极性，使学生在正常的学习情况下，可以获得较好的学习成绩。为了提高学生的学习成绩，学生在上课和自习时必须好好学习。但校长和教师必须切实注意保证学生有适当的娱乐、体育和休息时间，以保证和增进学生的健康，反对不适当地增加学生的课业负担。各校考试分数应是真实的，保证完全符合于学生的实际学习成绩。
    二、当前提高教育质量的关键，是领导教师深入地钻研教材和教学大纲，领会和掌握自己所教学科的教学目的、思想内容、科学内容，改进教学方法，使教师能正确地、系统地改进教学工作。为了做好这一工作，各级教育行政部门应有效地给各校教师以系统的具体的帮助，目前主要的是组织和领导有经验的教师和工作人员，群策群力地研究和改进教学，编辑教学指导和参考材料，随编随印，发给各校有关的教师，一面使用，一面集思广益地加以修改，及时交流先进经验和减轻教师在备课方面的负担，并提高他们的教学能力。对于从事此项编写工作的教师，应当减轻其原有的教学负担。
    为了使教育质量能够不断提高，必须加强教师的业务学习与政治学习。对于业务较差、授课还有困难的教师，应以业余或离职学习的方式提高其本科业务的基本知识，要求在一定限期内达到一定的业务水平，成为能够胜任的教师。其余的教师也应针对自己所教学科的不同需要，学习系统的专业知识。为了保证教师有足够的业余进修时间，应坚决减少教师的兼职和非教学活动。为了加强对教师业务进修工作的领导，应健全和扩大现在的教师进修学院和教师进修学校。对于教师的政治理论学习，应根据中、小学教师的情况规定比较长期的系统的学习计划，加强领导，提高质量。
    教育质量的提高必须建立在教师思想觉悟提高的基础上。应根据党的团结改造知识分子的政策，通过经常的教学工作和政治理论学习，开展批评和自我批评，加强教师的思想教育。目前除继续肃清封建、买办、法西斯思想的残余影响外，必须着重地系统地批判和克服教师中的资产阶级思想。
    为了使今后发展中、小学有足够的合格的师资，应加强培养师资的工作。今后增加新教师，必须加以严格的审查和认真的训练。
    三、对于教师的工作应有系统的考核，应根据学生成绩的优劣和进步速度的快慢来评定教师的工作成绩。对于成绩优良的，应注意培养和提高他们，使他们在改进教学工作中起带头作用和示范作用，并应给以奖励和逐步地、适当地提高其薪金待遇；对于成绩低劣的，应帮助他们改进和提高，如经过帮助、提高仍不能称职者，应予以解聘或让其转业；对于思想反动、品质恶劣的，应加以审查并作严肃处理，决不能无原则地优容姑息，贻误我们对后一代的教育。
    逐步改变工资制度中的平均主义现象。按劳取酬是社会主义的原则，应根据教师的工作成绩，给以应得的薪金待遇。对于编辑教学指导和参考材料的教师和教师兼教研组长或者班主任的，应在原有薪金以外，另给以适当报酬。
    在学生中应提倡尊师，在人民群众中应宣传教师在国家建设中的重大作用，以提高教师的社会地位，提高教师为人民服务的热忱。对于教师特别是女教师的困难问题和福利问题，政府主管部门和有关群众团体应尽可能作适当的解决。
    四、贯彻全面发展的教育，使学生切实作到
  “身体好，学习好，工作好”。教育学生深刻了解学习目的，充分发挥学习的自觉性、积极性，学好功课。切实改变目前对学生成绩考核不严，入学、升级、毕业标准不统一和过低的现象。今后入学、升级、毕业均须有严格的标准，对学习成绩和品行成绩优良的学生，应给以适当的精神奖励和物质奖励。考核成绩的标准必须统一，从初小四年级起，应有步骤地实行统一考试的办法。统一考试的科目，小学为语文、算术，中学除语文、数学外，应酌量增加其他主要的课程。
    加强对学生的政治思想教育。当前要特别加强劳动教育，以克服学生中的鄙视体力劳动、鄙视劳动人民的剥削阶级思想的影响。加强自觉纪律教育，贯彻学生守则，要使学生养成既有活泼创造的精神，又有遵守纪律的习惯。对于不遵守纪律的学生，应进行耐心的说服教育；对屡教不改的，应给以适当惩罚（但不得对学生施行体罚）；对品质十分恶劣的和有违法行为的，应作必要的处理。必须注意只有切实改进课堂教学和加强课外活动的指导，整顿学生纪律的工作才能充分有效。加强学生的政治思想教育，主要是通过政治课和其他课程的教学来进行；同时还必须加强班主任的工作和青年团、少先队的工作。
    在学生中应适当开展有益于学习、能够丰富与扩大知识领域的课外活动。文娱体育活动必须加强，以增进学生的身心健康。有些学校的学生中社团活动过多，应予适当减少，以免影响学生对课业的学习。
    五、市教育局、区文教科和学校的领导干部，应切实钻研教育业务，在业务上真正成为名实相符的内行；必须把主要的精力迅速地、坚持地放到教学研究和教学领导上去，系统地总结经验，学习苏联先进经验，交流和推广成绩优良的学校和模范教师的先进经验，学习和推广其他地区的先进经验，切实改进教学。市教育局应设立专门机构或专人负责管理教学研究和教学指导工作。教育行政部门应加强视察工作，经常地、系统地检查和帮助学校改进教学。应有计划地认真办好几个重点学校，以不断取得新的经验。对于教学成绩很差的学校，应分期分批地加以整顿。对于在教学方面缺乏必需的图书仪器设备的学校，应适当加以补充。
    校长和教师工作忙乱的主要原因，是党、政府和人民团体的市区两级领导机关多头地不分轻重缓急地向学校布置工作，市委缺乏统一地筹划和调整，以致使校长和教师教学以外的负担过多。为了保证教育质量的提高，必须切实减少校长和教师在教学以外的各种繁杂事务，在学生数量较多的学校中并应适当增加行政干部，协助校长处理行政事务，使校长能集中精力加强对教学工作的领导，使教师能集中精力改进教学工作。校长领导教学的主要助手是教导主任和教研组长，班主任。应不断地改进教研组的工作，充分发挥教师的集体互助作用；对各科教研组的组长，应保证他们有必要的时间进行研究工作。对班主任的工作，应随时加以帮助和检查，通过班主任的工作，提高学生的学习效果。
    为了加强领导，应尽可能减少教育行政部门和学校干部与教师的流动，以便积累教学经验。
    六、为了加强党对教育工作的领导，市委应设立教育部。学校中党的工作必须加强，党的组织必须切实起保证教学的作用。应积极地培养有相当政治觉悟的优秀教师成为党员、团员，以改变中、小学中党和团的力量薄弱的状况。
  提高教育质量，是当前学校教育的一项极端重要的工作，也是一项艰巨、复杂的工作。在这一工作中，必须采取积极稳步的方针，一方面要以自我批评的精神来克服工作中的缺点和错误，克服“差不多了”的自满情绪，不断地以工人阶级领导的人民民主国家应有的标准来要求自己，积极改进工作；另一方面，要稳步前进，防止在工作中可能产生的不适当的加重师生课业负担、妨碍师生健康等偏向。
    各级教育行政部门中和各学校中的党组织、各区区委、教育工会党组和有关的青年团组织，都应认真地讨论并贯彻执行上述决定。
