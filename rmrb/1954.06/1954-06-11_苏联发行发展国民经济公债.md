    The Soviet Union Issues National Economic Development Bonds
    By our correspondent Li He
    The Soviet people are dedicating their selfless labor to the lofty ideal of realizing communism. They are not complacent, but are always ready to contribute more strength to their motherland and their ideals. Their enthusiastic subscription to the 1954 National Economic Development Bonds is another manifestation of this Soviet patriotic spirit.

    After the news of the issuance of new national bonds was broadcast, people all over the Soviet Union enthusiastically subscribed. Ovchinnikov, a steelworker at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Moscow, said: "We all know that when we lend our hard-earned funds to the state, we will speed up the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Let our savings, like our steel, be used for the further development and prosperity of the Soviet state. I wholeheartedly subscribe to the new bonds."

    The Soviet Union is issuing 16 billion rubles in bonds this time, to be repaid in installments over 20 years. Subscription to the bonds is based entirely on the strict principle of voluntarism, and can be paid in installments over ten months. This year's bond issuance is close to last year's 15 billion rubles, both of which are half of the 30 billion rubles in 1951 and 1952. Like last year, this year's bonds limit workers' subscriptions to no more than two weeks' wages, and employees to no more than half a month's wages. This shows the government's care for the people. But regardless of the year, the bonds are subscribed to within a few days. In 1952, 70 million people subscribed.

    This is only natural. Because regardless of the social and economic situation, or the use of bonds, the Soviet Union is completely different from capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, workers are living in the shadow of economic crisis. Industrial and agricultural production levels in the United States have begun to decline sharply, and there are now about 15 million fully unemployed and semi-unemployed workers. Bonds issued by capitalist countries are usually used to make up for budget deficits caused by expanding armaments, that is, for preparing for war and for the enrichment of a few monopoly capitalists.

    In the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people are achieving one victory after another in communist construction. Now, on the basis of a strong heavy industry, while continuing to develop heavy industry, they are vigorously developing agriculture, consumer goods industry and commerce. On the basis of the development of production, the Soviet people are constantly improving their national income and living standards. After seven post-war price reductions, the Soviet people can now buy two or three times as many necessities with the same amount of rubles as in 1947. Therefore, the Soviet people have ample cash and savings from their hard work, and they are also willing to use their surplus resources to support the country's construction and help realize the great undertakings proposed by the Communist Party, such as opening up vast new lands and producing abundant necessities, which have never been seen in human history.

    Issuing national bonds is a regular and effective way for the Soviet Union to support national construction. The main source of construction funds in the Soviet Union is the income of the socialist economy, such as the 497 billion rubles in the 1954 national budget, which is nearly 87 percent, relying on the income of the socialist economy. But the issuance of national bonds is a reliable supplementary source of funds, both in the period of socialist construction and communist construction. The Soviet Union issued the first Industrialization Bonds in August 1927, and 6 million workers subscribed at that time. The second and third Industrialization Bonds were issued in 1928 and 1929, achieving even greater results. From 1930 to 1941, five-year plan construction bonds were issued every year (except for the national defense bonds issued in 1937). In the several five-year plans before the war, the Soviet Union supplemented a total of about 50 billion rubles of funds from the issuance of bonds. In 1939, the number of subscribers increased to 50 million. These funds played a huge role in supporting the Soviet Union's rapid construction into a strong country with industry and collectivized agriculture. June 10

    苏联发行发展国民经济公债
    本报记者　李何
    苏联人民以忘我的劳动献给在实现中的共产主义的崇高理想。他们不以此自满，而时刻准备好为自己的祖国，为自己的理想拿出更多的力量。他们热烈认购一九五四年发展苏联国民经济公债，便是这种苏维埃爱国主义精神的又一次表露。
    在国家发行新公债的消息从广播传出之后，全苏联各地人民就踊跃地进行认购。莫斯科“镰刀和铁锤”工厂炼钢工人奥甫钦尼科夫说：“我们每个人都知道，我们借给国家自己劳动得来的资金，我们就会加快完成第五个五年计划。让我们的储蓄，像我们的钢一样，放在苏维埃国家的进一步发展和繁荣上去。我全心地签购新公债”。
    苏联这次发行公债一百六十亿卢布，分期在二十年内还清。认购公债完全根据严格的自愿原则，可以在十个月内分期付款。今年公债发行额与去年一百五十多亿卢布相近，都比一九五一、一九五二年的三百亿卢布少一半。像去年一样，今年公债限制工人认购的数目不超过两星期工资，职员不超过半个月工资。这说明政府对人民的关怀。但是不论那一年，公债都是在几天内认购完毕的。一九五二年认购的达七千万人。
    这是很自然的。因为无论社会的经济状况，公债的用途，苏联是完全不同于资本主义国家的。在资本主义国家，劳动者正生活在经济危机的阴影之下。美国的工业和农业生产水平开始剧烈下降，现在约有一千五百万全失业和半失业工人。资本主义国家发行的公债通常是用在弥补由于扩张军备而产生的预算赤字的，也就是用在准备战争和为了少数垄断资本家的发财。
    在苏联、在共产党领导下，人民在共产主义建设中取得一个又一个的胜利，现在，在强大的重工业基础上，在继续发展重工业的同时，大力发展着农业、日用品工业和商业。在发展生产的基础上，苏联人民不断提高着国民收入和生活水平。经过战后七次减低物价，苏联人民现在以同样数目的卢布可以买到为一九四七年的二、三倍的必需品。所以苏联人民是有从勤劳得来的充分现金和积蓄的，而他们也愿意用自己盈余的资力支援国家的建设，帮助实现共产党所提出的开垦广大的新地、生产丰富的必需品等等人类历史上还没有见过的伟大事业。
    发行国家公债，这是苏联行之有效的支援国家建设的经常办法。苏联建设资金的主要来源是社会主义经济的收入，如一九五四年国家预算中四千九百七十亿卢布即近百分之八十七是靠社会主义经济的收入。但发行国家公债是资金的一项可靠的补充来源，在社会主义建设和共产主义建设时期都是如此。苏联在一九二七年八月发行了第一期工业化公债，当时认购的有六百万劳动者。一九二八、一九二九年发行了第二、三期工业化公债，取得更大成绩。从一九三○年起到一九四一年，每年都发行了五年计划的建设公债（除了一九三七年发行的是加强国防的公债）。在战前几个五年计划中，苏联从发行公债补充了总共约五百亿卢布的资金。在一九三九年认购的增加到五千万人。这些资金对于支援苏联加快地建设成工业和集体化农业的强国，起了巨大的作用。　六月十日
