Farmers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are using kerosene lamps, saving a large amount of vegetable oil. In the past, farmers in Inner Mongolia generally used rapeseed oil, sesame oil, or soybean oil for lamps, which consumed a large amount of vegetable oil. For example, in Getuohudong Township, Wuchuan County, more than 500 households had more than 660 oil lamps, consuming more than 47,600 jin of rapeseed oil a year. Now that farmers' lives have improved, most have switched to using kerosene lamps. Kerosene lamps are clean, bright, and fuel-efficient. One lamp saves at least 24,000 yuan in oil money per year compared to rapeseed oil lamps. After switching to kerosene lamps, farmers of all ethnic groups have sold the oil they saved to cooperatives. The supply station of the Guyandengkou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Siziwang Banner supplied local farmers with 227 jin of kerosene and 67 lamps in five days, while also purchasing 710 jin of oil, 421 jin of rapeseed, and flax.

    内蒙古自治区农民
    用煤油点灯节省了植物油料
    内蒙古自治区各族农民用煤油点灯，节省了大量油料。过去，内蒙古农民普遍用菜籽油、麻油或豆油点灯，植物油的消耗量很大，如武川县圪妥忽洞乡五百多户农民有六百六十多盏油灯，一年要消耗菜籽四万七千六百多斤。现在农民生活改善了，大都改用煤油点灯，煤油灯清洁、明亮又省油，一盏灯一年至少比菜油灯省两万四千元油钱。各族农民在改用煤油灯后，纷纷将节省下来的油料卖给合作社。萨拉齐县古雁镫口乡供销合作社供应站，五天当中供应当地农民二百二十七斤煤油、六十七盏灯，同时收购了七百一十斤油脂、四百二十一斤菜籽、胡麻。（新华社）
