Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 2nd. The East China Construction Engineering Bureau recently held its first Technical Innovation Representative Meeting to actively promote the technical innovation movement. The meeting was held from May 20th to 26th, with more than 250 representatives from various provinces and cities attending. At the meeting, the representatives introduced their technical innovation achievements, gave operation demonstrations, and exchanged advanced working methods for different types of work, such as carpentry, bricklaying, painting, and steel bar binding. After discussion, the meeting identified 33 types of advanced tools that could be vigorously promoted.
	Fu Akun, a carpenter from the First Construction Engineering Company of the East China Construction Engineering Bureau, used to make a maximum of 100 window mullions per day. After he created a "mortising machine," his work efficiency increased tenfold. Zhang Jin'gao, a carpenter from the Jiangsu Construction Engineering Bureau, created a "six-sided marking machine." As long as the wood is pushed into the marking machine and the foot is pressed on the pedal, all the lines of a window mullion can be drawn. This tool improves work efficiency by 17 times compared to the general old-fashioned marking method, and by four to six times compared to the improved marking frame. Using this "six-sided marking machine," a worker can mark six to ten door and window mullions in one minute. Chen Jianyun, a painter representative from Jiangsu Province, introduced his process of using natural raw lacquer to manufacture 35 kinds of colored wide lacquer. If his successful experience is promoted nationwide, it can save the country 120 billion yuan in foreign exchange annually. In addition, 67-year-old worker Zhang Fengquan also introduced his process of creating a "steel bar rolling device"; Li Huanwen, a demobilized revolutionary soldier who had been learning technology for only a little over a year, also introduced his process of improving the "sheet metal shearing machine" and creating a "square tube machine."
	During the meeting, the representatives also visited the Construction Technology Innovation Exhibition, which displayed 272 kinds of advanced tools and featured various advanced operation demonstrations. The representatives carefully recorded various operation methods and drew tool drawings according to their needs, preparing to return and promote them to the vast number of employees.

    华东建筑工程局召开技术革新者代表会议
    【新华社上海二日电】华东建筑工程局最近举行第一届技术革新者代表会议，积极推动技术革新运动。这次会议在五月二十日到二十六日举行，出席会议的有各省市的代表二百五十多人。会上代表们介绍了技术革新的事迹，进行了操作表演，交流了木工、瓦工、漆工、扎铁工等不同工种的先进工作法。经过讨论后，会议确定了三十三种可以大力推广的先进工具。
    华东建筑工程局第一建筑工程公司木工傅阿坤原来每天最多做一百根窗梃，他创造一种“凿雀机”后，工作效率提高十倍。江苏建筑工程局木工张锦皋创造的“六面划线机”，只要把木料向划线机里一推，用脚在踏板上一踏，一根窗梃的线就全部划好。这种工具较一般旧式划线法提高工作效率十七倍，较改进后的划线架也提高工作效率四倍到六倍。用这种“六面划线机”划线，一个工人一分钟就可以划好六根到十根门窗窗梃。江苏省代表漆工陈建云介绍了他用天然生漆制造三十五种彩色广漆的过程。如把他的成功的经验在全国范围内推广，每年可为国家节省一千二百亿元外汇。此外，如六十七岁老工人张凤权也介绍了他创造“轧钢筋器”的过程；学习技术仅一年多的转业革命军人李焕文也把他改进“剪白铁机”和创造“方管机”的经过作了介绍。
    会议期间，代表们还参观了陈列着二百七十二种先进工具和进行各种先进操作表演的建筑技术革新展览会。代表们根据自己需要用心记录了各种操作方法和画了工具图样，准备回去向广大职工推广介绍。
