China's First Downhole Electrical Logging Instrument Successfully Trial-produced
The Geology Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry has successfully trial-produced China's first downhole electrical logging instrument.

The downhole electrical logging instrument is an indispensable geophysical exploration instrument in petroleum and other drilling projects. It can accurately detect the existence and location of oil, gas layers, and all metal and non-metal mineral layers, enabling geologists to understand the nature of the rock formations and changes in strata. This instrument is an extremely complex and precise piece of equipment. Before liberation, China had no access to such instruments. In the few years since liberation, the need for electrical logging instruments has become more urgent due to the increasing annual petroleum drilling tasks. To meet this need, the Petroleum Administration Bureau successfully trial-produced a semi-automatic electrical logging instrument in 1950, and began to develop an automatic downhole electrical logging instrument in 1951. In early 1953, automatic electrical logging instruments were purchased from the Soviet Union, which provided great inspiration. They modified their own design, adopted the advantages of the Soviet electrical logging instruments, and combined them appropriately with the results of their own experimental research to partially improve the instrument to suit our needs, and then began the trial production of a complete set of instruments. In the trial production process, the initiative and creativity of the working class were brought into play, and the cooperation of all parties was obtained, overcoming various difficulties in the trial production process. For example, when fine suspension wires for manufacturing galvanometers could not be bought, the workers used their ingenuity and pressed them on a glass plate by hand. Another example is the galvanometer coil, which was finally wound after more than thirty trials by the technicians. After a year of efforts, this instrument was finally completed by the end of 1953, and after repeated corrections in the past few months, it was confirmed that the trial production was completely successful.

The greatest advantage of this instrument is its high electrical logging efficiency. With it, the logging efficiency can be greatly improved, the non-production time in the drilling process can be shortened, a high degree of automation can be achieved, and the progress of various drilling operations can be accelerated. At the same time, in terms of cost, the price of this instrument is reduced by more than 60% compared with imported instruments from abroad, and each instrument saves tens of billions of yuan compared with foreign orders, thus saving foreign exchange for the country. The petroleum industry alone can save the country hundreds of billions of yuan in foreign exchange in 1954.

The successful experiment of this instrument is not only a success in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also a creative application of the advanced Soviet scientific methods, demonstrating the great creative power of the Chinese working class.

    我国第一架井下电测仪试制成功
    中央燃料工业部石油管理总局地质局试制我国第一架井下电测仪成功。
    井下电测仪是石油及其他钻探工程中不可缺少的一种地球物理探测仪器，它能正确地探测油、气层及一切金属和非金属矿物层的存在位置，使地质工作者了解地层岩石的性质及地层变化情况。这种仪器是一种极其复杂精密的仪器，解放前，我国根本得不到这种仪器。解放后几年来，由于石油钻探任务的逐年增大，电测仪的需要也就更为迫切。为了满足这一需要，一九五○年石油管理总局试制成功半自动电测仪，一九五一年又开始着手试制井下自动电测仪。一九五三年初从苏联购进了自动电测仪，得到了很大的启发，修改了自己的设计，采用了苏联电测仪的优点，加上自己试验研究的成果，适宜地结合我们的需要加以局部改进，展开了全套仪器的试制工作。在试制过程中发挥了工人阶级的积极性和创造性，并取得了各方面的配合，克服了试制过程中的各种困难。如制造检流计用的细游丝买不到，工人们开动脑筋想办法，就用手在玻璃板上压制成了。又如检流计的线圈，经技术人员三十多次的试验终于绕成了。经过一年来的努力，这架仪器终于在一九五三年底完成了试制工作，又经过今年数月来的反复校正，证实了试制工作完全成功。
    这架仪器的最大优点是电测效率很高，有了它就大大的提高测井效率，缩短了钻探过程中的非生产时间，达到高度的自动化，加速各种钻探工作的进度。同时在成本方面比国外进口的仪器价格减低百分之六十以上，每架仪器较国外订制节约数十亿元，因而给国家节约了外汇，仅石油工业一九五四年就可以为国家节省外汇数百亿元。
    这架仪器的试验成功，不仅是学习苏联先进经验的成功，而且是创造性的运用了苏联先进科学方法，显示了我国工人阶级的伟大创造力量。
