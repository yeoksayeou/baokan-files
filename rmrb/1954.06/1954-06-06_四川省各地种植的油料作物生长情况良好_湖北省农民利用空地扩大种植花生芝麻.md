In the alluvial areas along the Tuo River, Fu River, and Yangtze River, and in some hilly areas, the seedlings of more than 1.2 million mu of peanuts have already grown to half a foot high. Sesame crops in various areas have grown to over a foot tall, and soybeans have also sprouted true leaves. Farmers are now thinning, protecting, cultivating, and fertilizing various oil crops to increase yield per unit area.
    Sichuan Province plans to expand the planting area of oil crops by 12% this year compared to last year. Farmers in various areas are actively responding to the national call to plant more oil crops. Some agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous counties have planted a portion of peanuts, sesame, and other oil crops according to soil conditions. Farmers in mountainous areas of Wanxian, Fuling, Luzhou, and other special districts are also using barren mountains and wasteland to plant oil tea trees, walnut trees, and other saplings. Farmers in other areas have also made full use of the edges of fields, corners of land, and vacant spaces in front and behind houses to plant many sunflowers and soybeans.

    湖北省农民利用空地扩大种植花生芝麻
    【新华社成都五日电】四川省各地农民种植的花生、芝麻、黄豆等油料作物，目前生长情况良好。在沱江、涪江、长江两岸的冲积地带和部分丘陵地区，一百二十多万亩花生出苗已半尺高。各地的芝麻已长到一尺多高，黄豆也长出了真叶。现在农民们正对各种油料作物进行匀苗、保苗、中耕、施肥，争取提高单位面积产量。
    四川省计划今年比去年扩大油料作物播种面积百分之十二。各地农民积极响应国家号召，多种油料作物。山区各县的一些农业生产合作社，都按照土质种了一部分花生、芝麻及其它油料作物。万县、涪陵、泸州等专区的山区农民还利用荒山、荒坝，栽植油茶树、核桃树等树苗。其他地区的农民也充分利用田边、地角和屋前屋后的空地，种植了许多向日葵和黄豆。
    【新华社武汉五日电】湖北省不少地区的农民利用荒地、田埂和屋边空地，扩大芝麻、花生等油料作物的种植面积。据黄冈、汉川、胜利、宜昌等县的重点乡的调查，今年油料作物种植面积一般比去年扩大了百分之十五左右。罗田县有十三个乡今年油料作物的种植面积比去年扩大了百分之五十。鄂城县农民除完成粮、棉播种计划外，还扩大芝麻和黄豆的种植面积一万四千多亩。光化县甫洲乡农民利用荒地、已干的水槽、沙地、屋边、堤边，种上大麻一千二百多亩。现在各地农民正采用各种方法，争取提高油料作物的单位面积产量。
