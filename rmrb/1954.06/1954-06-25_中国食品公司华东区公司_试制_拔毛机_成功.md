China Food Company, East China Region, Successfully Trial-Produces "Plucking Machine"
    The China Food Company, East China Region, recently successfully trial-produced a "plucking machine" used to replace manual chicken and duck feather removal. This machine is equipped with a roller with rubber thorns. When the power is switched on, the roller rotates rapidly. Workers place scalded chickens and ducks on it one by one. In just seven or eight seconds, the rubber thorns on the roller can remove all the feathers from the chickens and ducks. According to preliminary estimates, one machine can pluck the feathers of more than 300 chickens per hour, increasing efficiency fivefold compared to manual plucking. Moreover, because the rubber thorns are elastic, the skin of the plucked chickens and ducks remains intact, and the fat under the skin can also be preserved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    试制“拔毛机”成功
    中国食品公司华东区公司最近试制成功一种用来代替人工拔鸡、鸭毛的“拔毛机”。这个机器上装着带橡皮刺的滚筒，电门一开，滚筒飞快转动，工人把一只只热水烫过的毛鸡、毛鸭摆上去，只要七、八秒钟，滚筒上的橡皮刺就可以把鸡、鸭身上的羽毛全部拔光。据初步估计，一部机器每小时可拔去三百多只鸡的毛，比人工拔毛效率提高五倍。而且因为橡皮刺富有弹性，拔毛的鸡、鸭的表皮都能完整无损，皮里的脂肪也能保持。（新华社）
