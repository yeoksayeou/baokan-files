In the vast rural areas of Southwest China, the organizations of the Chinese Communist Party are growing stronger day by day. The rural Party organizations in Southwest China were mostly established in 1952 with the completion of land reform. By March of this year, the region had a total of 117,536 rural Party members, and more than 63 percent of the townships had established CCP branches. In Sichuan Province, more than 80 percent of the townships have established branches. Under the leadership and education of the township branches, many Communist Party members lead farmers in various production and construction activities, develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, promote the work of the government, and ensure the implementation of the Party's policies. After publicizing the general task of the state during the transition period in rural areas, the rural Party organizations in Southwest China have become more consolidated and developed. Currently, county committees and some district committees regularly focus on summarizing and promoting the experiences of township branches in educating Party members and leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Many counties have focused on equipping township branches with Party class instructors to strengthen the regular education of Party members. With the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the local and county committees are continuously training rural activists in large numbers and recruiting farmers with socialist consciousness into the Party. According to the Party building plans in various places, it is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of rural Party members in the region will reach around 200,000.

    西南区广大农村中共产党组织日益壮大
    在西南广大农村中，中国共产党的组织日益壮大。西南农村党的组织大部分是在一九五二年随着土地改革的完成先后建立的，到今年三月为止，全区共有农村党员十一万七千五百三十六人，有百分之六十三以上的乡建立了中共支部。四川省则有百分之八十以上的乡建立了支部。在乡支部的领导和教育下，许多共产党员领导农民进行各项生产建设，发展互助合作组织，推动政府的各项工作，使党的政策得以贯彻执行。经过在农村宣传国家在过渡时期的总任务后，西南农村党的组织更加巩固和发展了。现各县委和一部分区委经常有重点地总结乡支部教育党员和领导互助合作运动的经验，并加以推广。许多县有重点地给乡支部配备了党课教员，加强对党员的经常教育。随着农村互助合作运动的发展，各个地委或县委正不断大批训练农村积极分子，吸收有社会主义觉悟的农民入党。根据各地建党的计划，到今年年底，估计全区农村党员可达到二十万人左右。
