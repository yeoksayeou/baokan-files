Indochina Problem's Crux
By Our Correspondents Li Zhuang and Du Bo
The Geneva Conference has been discussing the Indochina issue for a month now. During this period, the conference has made positive progress; however, it cannot be ignored that the progress is slow.

The nine delegations participating in the discussions have reached an agreement on the principle of a complete, simultaneous, and rapid ceasefire throughout Indochina. According to this agreement, representatives of both commands have begun working in Geneva, hoping to submit recommendations to the conference as soon as possible regarding the implementation of the ceasefire.

To promote the work of the conference, the Chinese delegation suggested on May 27 that the conference identify common points as a basis for further discussion. The common principles proposed by the Chinese delegation were: 1. A complete and simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina; 2. Negotiations between the two sides on issues such as territorial adjustments; 3. Cessation of the import of new troops and armaments from abroad; 4. A mixed commission composed of both sides to supervise the ceasefire, and a neutral nations commission to conduct international supervision; 5. All participating countries jointly guarantee the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; 6. Exchange of prisoners of war and detained civilians. At the same time, the Chinese delegation suggested that the conference find ways to resolve points of difference.

Currently, the conference is discussing the fourth point of the Chinese delegation's proposal, namely the issue of ceasefire supervision and international monitoring.

All impartial observers believe that the progress made by the conference so far is mainly due to the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese delegation; conversely, the US delegation has been making every effort to hinder the progress of the conference, while the French delegation is considered to have shown a lack of enthusiasm and initiative in peacefully resolving the Indochina issue. This is the key reason for the slow progress of the conference.

As everyone knows, the proposal put forward by the French delegation at the first meeting on the Indochina issue only discussed military issues, completely ignoring political issues, thereby completely disregarding the national rights of the Indochinese people. In this plan on military issues, France, acting as the victor, put forward unreasonable conditions such as disbanding the resistance forces of Laos and Cambodia. In contrast, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam put forward a reasonable, realistic, and comprehensive proposal on May 10. This proposal included not only a military solution but also a political solution; it not only met the interests of the Indochinese people but also took into account France's economic and cultural interests; it included not only a solution to the Vietnam issue but also solutions to the Cambodia and Laos issues. This proposal by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was widely welcomed by international opinion and provided a good start to the work of the conference.

Just as the conference was stagnating due to the Western countries' insistence on unreasonable demands, the Soviet delegation made two important additions to the proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 14, thereby creating the conditions for the conference to quickly begin practical work. The conference entered the stage of restricted meetings from May 17, and then, due to the efforts of the Soviet delegation with the support of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Chinese delegation, the restricted meeting decided to use Pham Van Dong's proposal, Bidault's proposal, and the supplementary proposal of the Soviet delegation as the basis for discussion, and decided to discuss both military and political issues, starting with military issues. In this way, the conference quickly moved from procedural issues to substantive discussions.

However, due to France and other Western countries insisting on first deciding to handle the Cambodia and Laos issues and the Vietnam issue separately, the secret meeting once again fell into time-consuming debates. The five questions summarized by the Soviet delegation based on the opinions of all parties helped to break this deadlock and paved the way for the beginning of discussions on military issues.

At the restricted meetings on May 24 and 25, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam put forward just principles that must be followed in resolving the ceasefire issue. This proposal, especially its provisions on demarcating the areas of concentration of the armies of both sides and adjusting areas, was considered another major contribution to restoring peace in Indochina. Public opinion generally believes that this proposal has strengthened people's hopes for an early ceasefire. In order to promote the progress of the conference, the delegation of the People's Republic of China put forward six principles on May 27 based on the common points and differences of opinion of all parties. It was due to the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, and the Soviet delegation, as well as the proposals put forward by the British delegation based on the opinions of all parties, that the conference reached an agreement on May 29 on arranging meetings between representatives of both commands.

However, due to the obstruction of the French and American delegations, the discussion on the issue of ceasefire supervision did not make due progress during this period. On several major issues, there is still considerable distance between the opinions of the two sides.

First, on the issue of the composition of the neutral nations supervisory commission, the Soviet delegation put forward a constructive proposal at the beginning of the discussion to form a neutral nations commission composed of Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, and Pakistan. This proposal drew on the experience of the Korean armistice and took into account the interests of both belligerent parties. However, Western countries, especially the United States, opposed this proposal without any reason; at the same time, it could not put forward any specific proposals of its own. They insisted that "communist countries" could not be considered "neutral countries." Obviously, this view of judging the neutrality of a country according to political ideology and social system is completely contrary to international law and also disregards the experience of the Korean armistice. In fact, this view is equivalent to denying that there are any neutral countries in the world, because all countries in the world belong to different political ideologies and social systems, belonging either to non-capitalism or capitalism. The Soviet delegation's proposal to form an international supervisory commission composed of India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Pakistan is reasonable because two of these four countries—Poland and Czechoslovakia—have diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the other two countries—India and Pakistan—have diplomatic relations with France, so that they can maintain contact with both sides, take care of the interests of both sides, and easily make practical and feasible recommendations acceptable to both sides.

On the issue of the functions and relations of the ceasefire monitoring mechanism, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Chinese delegation both pointed out that since the belligerent parties are the main bodies of the ceasefire, the implementation of the ceasefire agreement depends on the belligerent parties, and the mixed supervisory commission composed of both sides should bear the main responsibility for supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement; as for the neutral nations supervisory commission, it should be responsible for monitoring and investigating acts that violate the ceasefire agreement. The tasks of these two organizations are different, and their relationship should be parallel, with division of labor and interrelationship, and not that one organization is subordinate to another. However, the French delegation insisted that the mixed supervisory commission should be subordinate to the neutral nations supervisory commission, which is to make the mixed commission subordinate to external power. In fact, the recommendations of the neutral nations supervisory commission ultimately have to be implemented through the belligerent parties. The agreement of the belligerent parties is of decisive significance. Any approach imposed by one party on the other, rather than an agreement between the two parties, is unworkable. As a belligerent party bearing the main responsibility for implementing the ceasefire agreement, the French delegation's approach of abandoning its obligations to neutral countries cannot but arouse doubts about its sincerity in ceasing hostilities.

At the same time, the French delegation also insisted on the unreasonable demand that ceasefire monitoring should only be implemented in Vietnam and not in Cambodia and Laos. According to this view, Cambodia and Laos only have one problem, which is the withdrawal of the Vietnamese People's Army, which does not exist in these two countries. Obviously, this view actually violates the agreement already reached at the conference on a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina. Because since everyone has accepted the principle of a simultaneous ceasefire throughout Indochina, the main task of the neutral nations supervisory commission is naturally to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement throughout the territory, and Cambodia and Laos should naturally be no exception, otherwise it will concentrate hostilities in Cambodia and Laos, and it will also facilitate other countries, mainly the United States, to establish military bases in these two countries, directly threatening peace in Indochina; in this way, the ceasefire cannot be stable and lasting, and there is always a danger of leading to a full-scale conflict again.

At present, the discussions of the nine-nation delegation conference are still limited to the issue of military ceasefire, and discussions on political issues have not yet begun. The Soviet Union, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Chinese delegation have repeatedly urged to start discussions on political issues as soon as possible, but the Western delegations are deliberately delaying. All indications show that they have not seriously considered respecting the national rights of the Indochinese people. The attitude of the French and American delegations in the course of the conference has also become an important topic of discussion.

According to a Reuters report on the 5th, even British sources close to the conference expressed "surprise" at the French delegation's insistence on unreasonable attitudes and lack of initiative at the conference. These people pointed out that "although the outcome of the conference will directly affect France's vital interests, France is standing aside" and "not showing the slightest initiative." Reuters also said that the French side "seems to have directly followed the 'hard line' taken by Washington against the Viet Minh and the CCP."

Western newspapers pointed out that France's attitude is related to the pressure exerted on it by the United States inside and outside the conference. The "Journal de Genève" on June 4 said that Western diplomats, when talking about France's situation at the Geneva conference, pointed out that "France is still holding the cards, but it is no longer France playing the cards," and now it is the United States that is "playing the cards."

It is obvious to all that the US delegation has consistently obstructed the conference from making any real progress. It has been noted that the US delegation has never put forward a positive proposal during the entire discussion process. The characteristics of the US delegation's activities at the meeting are a series of oppositions, "reservations," and refusals to express their position, and the use of the three puppet delegations of Indochina to obstruct the progress of the meeting. On major issues such as stopping reinforcements from outside Indochina and the joint guarantee of a ceasefire by the nine countries, the US delegation has adopted a reserved attitude or refused to express its opinion. Just as the just principles on implementing a ceasefire put forward by the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam brought new hope to the conference, the US delegation instigated and supported the Bao Dai representative behind the scenes to clamor against regional adjustments in order to obstruct the realization of a ceasefire. And after the conference reached an agreement on the issue of meetings between representatives of both commands, the US delegation publicly stated that it would reserve the right not to agree to the recommendations that the representatives of both commands might put forward. The US delegation's practice of threatening others in advance to succumb to US will is considered a rare act of arrogance in international conferences. As for the issue of international monitoring currently under discussion, the US delegation itself has also expressed its agreement in principle to neutral nations monitoring, but in the discussion, it still raised various fallacies such as "communist countries" not being considered "neutral countries" to make trouble unreasonably, with the purpose of obstructing the conference from reaching any agreement.

On the other hand, outside the Geneva Conference, the United States is also stepping up its pressure on France to follow it in continuing and expanding the Indochina War. The United States is demanding that France send more troops to Indochina to fight, and is demanding that France hand over the command of the Indochina War to the United States. A reporter for the French "News" reported that the Pentagon is considering expanding the Indochina War in the fall, "perhaps sooner." The recent dissemination by the United States of the news that it would stop airlifting French troops to Indochina was also considered a means of forcing France to submit.

The French public and many political figures who are concerned about the restoration of peace in Indochina are demanding that France break free from the shackles of the United States and sincerely seek peace at the Geneva Conference. In the debate on the Indochina issue that has now begun in the French parliament, many parliamentarians have criticized the French government for following the adventurous policy of the United States. Motions put forward by several political parties all demand that the French government conduct serious peace negotiations at the Geneva Conference.

An article written by Professor Lévy-Bruhl published in the French "Volunteer Army News" on the 4th also reflected this sentiment of the French public. The article said: "The government cannot and will never be able to convince people that the Indochina War is in line with the needs of the country... The public has begun to realize the terrible consequences of the internationalization of the war planned by our diplomats... This is the profound reason why the Indochina War is unpopular."

Now, the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue has entered its fifth week. The restricted meetings and the meetings between representatives of both commands in Geneva are working simultaneously. As long as the Western countries adopt a serious attitude of consultation, it is entirely possible for the restricted meetings to reach an agreement on the issue of ceasefire supervision and on other issues to be discussed in the future. Similarly, as long as the representatives of both commands abandon the intention of taking advantage at the conference table in the spirit of fairness and realism, they will not find it difficult to come up with a solution that can be accepted by everyone on issues such as regional adjustments and the demarcation of the areas of concentration of the troops of both sides. The key to all issues lies in France, in the French government, which is standing at a crossroads. As a party concerned, as long as France is determined to take the path of peace, then no force can drag it towards war. At this time when the conference is about to enter another new stage, peace-loving people from all countries, especially the French people, should make unremitting efforts to strive for a quick ceasefire and lasting peace in Indochina.

    印度支那问题的症结
    本报记者　李庄　杜波
    日内瓦会议从开始讨论印度支那问题以来，已经一个月了。在这期间，会议已经获得了肯定的进展；但是不能忽视的是，会议的进展是缓慢的。
    参加讨论的九国代表团已经就完全、同时并迅速在印度支那全境停火的原则达成了协议。根据这一协议，双方司令部代表已经在日内瓦开始工作，以期早日就有关实施停火的各项问题向会议提出建议。
    为了推动会议的工作，中国代表团在五月二十七日建议会议把共同点确定下来，以作为进一步讨论的基础。中国代表团建议通过的共同原则就是：一、在印度支那全境完全、同时停火；二、双方就调整地区等问题进行谈判；三、停止从境外运入新的军队和军火；四、由双方组成的混合委员会监督停战，组织中立国委员会进行国际监督；五、与会各国共同保证停战协定的履行；六、交换战俘和被拘平民。同时，中国代表团建议会议，就差异之点找寻方法，加以解决。
    目前会议正就中国代表团所提建议中第四点，即停战监督和国际监察问题，进行讨论。
    一切公正的观察家都认为，会议迄今所获得的进展，主要地应归功于越南民主共和国、苏联和中国代表团的努力；相反地，美国代表团竭力阻挠会议的进展，而法国代表团则被认为表现出对和平解决印度支那问题缺乏热情和主动。这是会议进展迟缓的关键所在。
    大家知道，法国代表团在讨论印度支那问题的第一次会议上所提出的建议，只谈到了军事问题，完全撇开了政治问题，从而也就完全漠视了印度支那人民的民族权利。而在这个关于军事问题的方案中，法国又以战胜者自居，提出了解散寮国和高棉抗战军队等等无理条件。与此相反，越南民主共和国代表团在五月十日提出了一个合理的现实的全面建议。这个建议，不仅包括军事解决，而且包括政治解决；不仅符合印度支那人民的利益，而且照顾了法国的经济和文化利益；不仅包括越南问题的解决，而且包括高棉、寮国问题的解决。越南民主共和国代表团的这个建议，受到了各国舆论的普遍欢迎，并为会议的工作提供了良好的开端。
    正当会议由于西方国家坚持无理主张而停滞不前的时候，苏联代表团在五月十四日对越南民主共和国的建议提出了两项重要补充，从而创造了会议迅速开始实际工作的条件。会议从五月十七日开始进入了限制性会议的阶段，接着又由于苏联代表团在越南民主共和国和中国代表团支持之下所作的努力，限制性会议决定以范文同的建议和皮杜尔的建议以及苏联代表团的补充建议作为讨论的基础，并决定对军事和政治问题都要加以讨论，而先从讨论军事问题开始。这样，会议就迅速地从程序问题转入了实质问题的讨论。
    然而由于法国和其他西方国家坚持必须首先决定把高棉寮国问题和越南问题分别处理，秘密会议又一次陷入了费时的争论。苏联代表团根据各方意见所归纳的五个问题，有助于打破这个僵局，并为开始讨论军事问题开辟了道路。
    越南民主共和国代表团在五月二十四日和二十五日限制性会议上，提出了解决停火问题所必须遵循的公正原则。这个建议，特别是其中关于划定双方军队集结地区和调整区域的规定，被认为是对于恢复印度支那和平的另一重大贡献。各方舆论普遍认为这个建议加强了人们对于早日实现停火的希望。为了推动会议的进展，中华人民共和国代表团又在五月二十七日根据大家意见中的共同点和差异点，提出了六点原则。正是由于越南民主共和国、中国和苏联代表团的努力以及英国代表团根据各方意见所提出的建议，会议才在五月二十九日就安排双方司令部代表会谈问题达成了协议。
    但是由于法国和美国代表团的阻挠，关于停战监督问题的讨论，在此期间并没有获得应有的进展。在若干重大的问题上，双方意见还存在着相当的距离。
    首先，在中立国监察委员会的成员问题上，苏联代表团在讨论刚开始的时候就提出了由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度和巴基斯坦组成中立国委员会的建设性建议。这个建议吸取了朝鲜停战的经验，照顾了交战双方的利益。然而西方国家，特别是美国，却毫无理由地反对这个建议；同时，它自己又提不出任何具体的建议来。他们硬说，“共产主义国家”不能算是“中立国”。显然，这种按照政治思想和社会制度来判断一个国家的中立性的说法是完全违反国际法的，同时也漠视了朝鲜停战的经验。事实上这种说法就等于是否认世界上有任何中立国存在，因为世界上所有国家都属于不同的政治思想和社会制度的，不属于非资本主义，就属于资本主义。苏联代表团提出由印、波、捷、巴四国组成国际监察委员会是合理的，因为这四个国家中有两个国家——波兰和捷克斯洛伐克和越南民主共和国有外交关系，另两个国家——印度和巴基斯坦则和法国有外交关系，这样就能和双方保持联系，照顾双方的利益，容易作出为双方接受的切实可行的建议。
    在监督停战机构的职权和关系问题上，越南民主共和国以及中国代表团都指出，由于交战双方是停战的主体，停战协定的执行要依靠交战双方，由双方所组成的混合监督委员会应负监督执行停战协定的主要责任；至于中立国监察委员会，则应负监察和调查违反停战协定行为的责任。这两个组织的任务不同，它们的关系应该是平行、分工并相互关联的，而不应该是一个组织从属于另一个组织。然而法国代表团却主张混合监督委员会应从属于中立国监察委员会，这种主张就是要使混合委员会从属于外在的权力。实际上中立国监察委员会的建议归根到底要通过交战双方来执行。交战双方的协议有着决定性的意义。如果不是双方协议，而是一方强加于另一方的任何作法，都是行不通的。作为对执行停战协定负有主要责任的交战一方，法国代表团这种把本身义务放弃给中立国的作法，不能不引起人们对其停止敌对行动的诚意的怀疑。
    同时，法国代表团还坚持停战监察只应在越南实行而不应在高棉寮国实行的无理主张。根据这种主张，高棉和寮国只有一个问题，就是撤退在这两国中并不存在的越南人民军问题。显然，这种主张实际上是违反了会议已经达成的关于在印度支那全境同时停火的协议。因为既然大家都已接受了在印度支那全境同时停火的原则，那么中立国监察委员会的主要任务自然是监察停战协定在全境的实施，高棉和寮国自然也不应有所例外，否则就会使敌对行动集中在高棉和寮国，而且这还会便利于其他国家，主要是美国，在这两国建立军事基地，直接威胁印度支那和平；这样，停战就不能得到稳定和持久，并随时有重新导致全面冲突的危险。
    目前九国代表团会议的讨论，还仅限于军事停战问题，关于政治问题的讨论，还没有开始。苏联、越南民主共和国和中国代表团曾一再敦促尽早开始政治问题的讨论，但西方国家代表团有意拖延。种种迹象表明，他们并没有认真考虑尊重印度支那人民的民族权利。法国和美国代表团在会议过程中的态度，也成为人们议论的重要题目。
    根据路透社五日报道，连接近会议的英国方面人士都对法国代表团在会议上坚持无理态度并缺乏主动精神表示“惊讶”。这些人士指出，“虽然会议结果将直接关涉法国的切身利益，法国却站在一旁”，并且“不表现出丝毫的主动性”。路透社还说，法国方面“似乎已直接追随华盛顿所采取的对越盟和中共的‘强硬路线’了”。
    西方报纸指出，法国的这种态度与美国在会议内外对它所施加的压力有关。六月四日的“日内瓦日报”说，西方外交家在谈论法国在日内瓦会议上的处境时指出，“拿牌的还是法国，但是玩牌的已不再是法国了”，现在“玩牌”的是美国。
    美国代表团一贯阻挠会议获得任何真正的进展，这已是人所共见的了。人们注意到在整个讨论过程中，美国代表团从来没有提出过一项积极的建议。美国代表团在会上活动的特点是，用一连串反对、“保留”和拒绝表明态度的作法，并利用印度支那三个傀儡代表团来阻挠会议获得进展，在停止从印度支那境外增援和九国共同保证停战等重大问题上，美国代表团都采取保留态度或拒绝表示意见。正当越南民主共和国代表团提出的关于实施停火的公正原则给会议带来了新希望的时候，美国代表团却在幕后指使和支持保大代表，出来叫嚣反对区域调整，以便阻挠停火的实现。而在会议就双方司令部代表会谈问题达成协议之后，美国代表团又公开表示将对双方司令部代表可能提出的建议保留不予同意的权利。美国代表团这种事先威胁别人屈从于美国意旨的做法，被认为是国际会议上少见的专横行为。至于目前正在讨论的国际监察问题，美国代表团自己也曾表示过同意中立国监察的原则，然而它在讨论中却仍然提出什么“共产主义国家”不算“中立国”的种种谬论来无理取闹，其目的就是要阻挠会议获得任何的协议。
    另一方面，在日内瓦会议的外面，美国也正在加紧压迫法国追随它继续和扩大印度支那战争。美国正在要求法国派遣更多的军队到印度支那去作战，并要求法国把印度支那战争的指挥权交给美国。法国“新闻报”记者报道，五角大楼正在考虑在秋季，“也许早一些”，扩大印度支那战争。最近美国一度散布将停止空运法军到印度支那去的消息，也被认为是压迫法国就范的一种手段。
    关心恢复印度支那和平的法国的公众和许多政界人士，都要求法国摆脱美国的羁绊，真心地在日内瓦会议上谋求和平。在现已开始的法国议会关于印度支那问题的辩论中，不少议员都指摘法国政府追随美国的冒险政策。好几个政党提出的议案都要求法国政府在日内瓦会议上认真地进行和平协商。
    法国“义勇军报”在四日刊载的勒维—勃鲁尔教授所撰写的文章，也反映了法国公众的这种情绪。文章说：“政府不能也永远不能使人相信印度支那战争是符合国家的需要的……公众已开始了解到我国外交家打算的战争国际化的可怖后果了……这就是印度支那战争不得人心的深刻理由”。
    现在，日内瓦会议关于印度支那问题的讨论已经进入第五周了。限制性会议和双方司令部代表在日内瓦的会议正在同时进行工作。只要西方国家采取认真协商的态度，限制性会议在停战监督问题上以及今后讨论的其他问题上，达成协议是完全有可能的。同样，只要双方司令部代表本着公平现实的精神，放弃在会议桌上占便宜的打算，他们在区域调整和划定双方军队集结地区等问题上也不难得出能为大家所接受的解决办法。一切问题的关键在于法国，在于正站在十字路口的法国政府。作为当事一方的法国只要下定决心走和平的道路，那么就没有任何力量可以把它拖向战争。当此会议即将进入另一新的阶段的时候，爱好和平的各国人士，特别是法国人民，应该毫不松懈地再接再厉地为在印度支那的迅速停战和持久和平作更大的努力。
