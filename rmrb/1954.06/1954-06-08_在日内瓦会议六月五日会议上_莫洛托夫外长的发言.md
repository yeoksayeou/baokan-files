Molotov's Speech at the Geneva Conference on June 5th

Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

For more than a month, the discussion on the Korean question has been proceeding at this conference. The discussion of this urgent international issue, which is related to the maintenance of peace and security in the Far East, has attracted close attention in all countries.

The people of Asian countries have shown particular concern for the discussion of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference. Together with the people of all peace-loving countries, they hope that the current conference will adopt a unanimous agreement to ensure an early peaceful settlement of the Korean question, in order to promote the national reunification of Korea and the establishment of an independent, democratic Korean state, thereby easing international tensions.

All of this undoubtedly places a great responsibility on all participants of the Geneva Conference to conduct an objective and fair study of the Korean question, in order to seek a solution to the Korean question in accordance with the interests of the Korean people and for the consolidation of international peace.

It is beneficial at this point to summarize some of the results of the general debate.

The suggestions put forward by the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea, and other delegations have been discussed here. The exchange of views on these suggestions has been conducive to clarifying the attitudes of the various delegations. It can be said that, as a result of the exchange of views, there has been a certain degree of reconciliation of opinions on some of the basic principles that serve as the basis for a peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

In this regard, we should mention the opinions expressed here by the head of the British delegation, which are undoubtedly worthy of attention. I am referring to his proposal on May 13th to establish the fundamental principles for reaching an agreement on the Korean question. We agree with the opinion that a preliminary decision on the fundamental principles of a future agreement on Korea will ensure that we have a better opportunity to complete the work that has already begun.

There is sufficient reason to specifically point out some important issues on which the Soviet delegation believes that the conference can immediately make a unanimous decision, because on these issues, the opinions of the various delegations have already reached a certain degree of consensus.

What are these issues?

(1) The participants expressed their support for holding all-Korean national assembly elections throughout Korea. This election must enable the Korean people to freely express their will and realize their legitimate desire to unify the country on a democratic basis. Naturally, this election should be held in accordance with the all-Korean election law, which will stipulate universal suffrage, secret ballot, and proportional representation in the all-Korean legislative body.

(2) During the discussion, the suggestion to establish an all-Korean body to prepare for and conduct free general elections was discussed. It is impossible to imagine that, after the various events that have occurred in the past, measures as important to Korea as holding general elections can be taken without sufficient preparation throughout Korea and without taking into account the economic and political characteristics that exist within the country.

Some delegations have already expressed here their opinions on what kind of organization this body might be and according to what principles its activities should be based. For example, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed that an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea be established to prepare for and conduct elections, and to reach agreements on taking urgent measures to rebuild and develop economic and cultural relations between the two parts of Korea. If the conference agrees in principle to establish an all-Korean body for the above-mentioned purposes, that would be a step forward, because without this body, all-Korean elections would be practically impossible to hold. As for the composition, functions, and principles according to which this body conducts its activities, these issues can be discussed separately.

(3) The participants in the conference acknowledged that any solution to the Korean question should stipulate the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. The suggestion put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulates the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea before the holding of all-Korean elections. The issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops is also reflected in the proposal put forward by the delegation of the Republic of Korea, although this proposal contains reservations, believing that the withdrawal of American troops "can begin before the election, but must not be completed before the unified government of Korea has achieved complete control over the entire Korea." Despite the differences between these proposals, since all participants in the conference acknowledge the necessity of withdrawing foreign troops, it would be a positive factor if the conference were to state in principle that it agrees to the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea. As for the specific deadlines for the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from North and South Korea, this should be discussed separately.

(4) All participants agreed that all-Korean elections should be held under the supervision of an international body. However, different opinions were expressed at the meeting regarding the procedures to be followed in establishing this international body. The suggestion put forward by the delegation of the People's Republic of China advocated that a neutral nations committee, the composition of which would be the same as the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, should supervise the Korean elections. The Soviet delegation supports this suggestion, believing that it is in accordance with the goals that will be stipulated for this organization. Some participants spoke in favor of entrusting the supervision of elections to a United Nations commission.

The Soviet delegation believes that the conference can decide in principle on the establishment of an international committee to supervise the holding of elections. As for the composition and scope of authority of this committee, further exchange of views can be conducted to reach an agreement.

(5) All participants pointed out the importance of creating the necessary conditions for preventing the violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and ensuring the peaceful development of Korea. The opinions expressed in this regard are that the peaceful development of Korea can be guaranteed if the countries that are most concerned about maintaining peace in the Far East undertake appropriate obligations. This will help to complete the task of national reunification of Korea. The suggestions of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulate in detail the solution to this important issue.

Obviously, the conference must not avoid this serious issue, which is related to maintaining peace in Korea. At present, the conference has already been able to adopt a decision on the issue of the need for the countries that are most concerned about ensuring the peaceful development of Korea to undertake appropriate obligations. As for the specific countries that will undertake the aforementioned obligations and the nature of these obligations, these issues should be discussed separately.

The Soviet delegation believes that these are the issues that should be considered first. The principles on which the views of some participants differ from each other should also be carefully considered, and efforts should be made to seek practical ways to implement them. The Soviet delegation has no intention of underestimating these differences.

The existence of differences is due to important issues such as the necessity to establish an all-Korean body with authority over all the people of Korea in the near future, the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea, and guaranteeing the conditions necessary for the further peaceful development of Korea by relevant countries - it is enough to point out these.

The Soviet delegation believes that participants must strive to reconcile their views and reach mutually acceptable agreements on these principles. In this regard, the Soviet delegation believes that representatives are now able to conduct concrete discussions on the above-mentioned issues related to the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. At the same time, it is also appropriate to list in a corresponding decision the fundamental issues on which some representatives have been able to reach an agreement during the discussion.

Based on the above, the Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to submit the following draft resolution to the conference for discussion:

"The participants of the Geneva Conference have reached an agreement on the following basic principles for the peaceful settlement of the Korean question:

1.  In order to unify Korea and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state, free elections should be held throughout the territory of Korea.

Elections should be held within six months after the conclusion of this agreement.

Elections should be conducted on the basis of secret ballot and universal suffrage.

The number of representatives in the all-Korean legislative body should be proportional to the population of all of Korea.

2.  In order to prepare for and conduct free all-Korean elections, and to promote reconciliation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, an all-Korean body composed of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should be established.

The composition and tasks of this body remain to be further studied.

3.  All foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea within a prescribed period.

The time limits and stages for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea before the free all-Korean elections remain to be further studied.

4.  It should be decided to establish an appropriate international committee to supervise the holding of free all-Korean elections.

The composition of this committee remains to be further studied.

5.  In view of the importance of preventing any disruption to peace in Korea, it should be recognized that it is necessary for countries that are most directly concerned about maintaining peace in the Far East to undertake obligations to ensure the peaceful development of Korea, which will promote the solution of the issue of national unification of Korea.

The question of which countries will undertake obligations to ensure the peaceful development of Korea and the nature of these obligations remains to be further studied."

The Soviet delegation's proposal currently emphasizes such issues that, in the Soviet delegation's view, it is possible to adopt a unanimous decision. However, it is clear from the text of this proposal that even if these general provisions are adopted, there are still some issues that have not been resolved, and it is impossible to achieve the national unification of Korea without reaching an agreement on these issues. Everyone should not underestimate the complicated nature of the current situation.

Finally, I think it is necessary to talk in detail about the speech of the American representative at the meeting on May 28. Under the pretext of defending the United Nations organization, the American representative tried his best to defend the American aggression against Korea, as well as the illegal actions of the United Nations organization that directly and repeatedly violated the United Nations Charter. The American representative tried his best to portray the American aggression against Korea as the implementation of the principle of collective security, and of course, this cannot be done without distorting the facts.

The American representative even insisted that the Soviet Union denies the principle of collective security, while everyone knows that the Soviet Union is the most active fighter in defending the principle of collective security, and it was and still is in favor of the practical application of the above principle. There is no need to repeat the well-known fact that the Soviet Union struggled for collective resistance to aggression in the period before the Second World War. Everyone knows that after the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union has never stopped its struggle against the policy pursued by the United States of dividing the world into opposing military blocs.

The steps recently taken by the Soviet Union to ensure collective security are well known to everyone. The Soviet government proposed the conclusion of the "Pan-European Treaty for Ensuring Collective Security in Europe" and expressed its willingness to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because we believe that after a peace-loving country like the Soviet Union joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it would turn the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from an aggressive organization that makes this national group oppose that national group into an institution of collective security. In addition, at the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union also announced its support for the desire to ensure the collective security of the people of Asian countries expressed in the speech of the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

Everyone knows that all these steps aimed at ensuring the real collective security of all countries -- regardless of their national social systems -- have been stubbornly opposed by American officials. These are the real facts.

Speaking of the United Nations, the Soviet Union, as one of the founders of this organization, has always tried to make this organization a real organization to ensure peace and international security, because the United Nations Charter, its basic principles, and the purpose for which this international organization was established all require this. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union is struggling against attempts to turn the United Nations into a tool of the aggressive policies of the United States or certain groups of countries, and this attempt is particularly manifested in this matter: the United Nations passed illegal resolutions approving American aggression against Korea.

Even when exerting crude pressure on the United Nations and even when forcibly engaging in shameful violations of the main articles of the United Nations Charter - such as on the Korean issue and on the issue of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations - the American representative has tried to portray himself as the protector of the United Nations. But if people violate the principles of the United Nations and the United Nations Charter itself, they cannot support and consolidate the international authority of the United Nations. These violations, carried out under American pressure, undermine the foundations of the United Nations. And the Soviet Union, in struggling against acts that violate the basic principles of the United Nations and violate the United Nations Charter, has maintained the honor and power of the United Nations.

Here, there have been attempts to portray the American ruling clique as warriors fighting for justice and peace, as defenders of human rights, and as guardians of moral principles. However, it has long been known that words only have value or meaning when they are in accordance with actions and facts. But here we see a different situation. Even now, while ways to peacefully resolve the Korean question have not yet been fully discussed, new threats of American aggression have already occurred - this time in the Southeast Asian region - it is enough to point this out.

The American representative expressed full support for the proposals made by the South Korean representative at the end of his speech, but it is obvious that these proposals are not in line with the actual situation in Korea and therefore cannot serve as the basis for a resolution of the Geneva Conference.

Under the efforts of the Soviet delegation, only such articles have been included in the draft resolution to draw the attention of the representatives, which can serve as the basis for the Geneva Conference's resolution on the Korean question, if everyone shows sincerity in reaching an agreement. At the same time, the Soviet delegation also proposed to continue to exchange views on the issues under dispute.

The Soviet delegation believes that the passage of the aforementioned resolution will promote the future work of the conference and will contribute to reaching an agreement that is in line with the interests of the Korean people and the interests of strengthening world peace.

### 在日内瓦会议六月五日会议上  莫洛托夫外长的发言

    在日内瓦会议六月五日会议上
    莫洛托夫外长的发言主席先生，诸位代表先生：
    在这个会议上，朝鲜问题的讨论已经进行了一个多月了。关于这个和维持远东和平与安全有关的迫切的国际问题的讨论，在世界各国引起了密切的注意。
    亚洲各国人民对于日内瓦会议上朝鲜问题的讨论表现得特别关心，他们和一切爱好和平的国家的人民在一起，希望现在的会议通过一致协议的决定，保证朝鲜问题早日和平解决，以促成朝鲜的国家统一和建立一个独立、民主的朝鲜国家，从而缓和国际紧张局势。
    所有这些，无疑地使日内瓦会议的全体到会者负有很大的责任来对朝鲜问题作客观的、公正的研究，以按照朝鲜人民的利益并为了巩固国际和平而谋求朝鲜问题的解决。
    目前来总结一下一般辩论的一些结果是有好处的。
    在这里，讨论了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团、大韩民国代表团以及其他代表团提出的建议。就这些建议交换的意见是有利于澄清各个代表团的态度的。可以这样说，由于交换意见的结果，在作为和平解决朝鲜问题的基础的一些基本原则上，意见已经有了一定程度的调和。
    在这方面，我们应该提到英国代表团团长在这里所表示的意见，无疑的，这些意见是值得注意的。我指的是他在五月十三日提出的规定基本原则以便在朝鲜问题上达成协议的建议。我们同意这样的意见，就是，对朝鲜将来的协议的根本原则通过初步决定，将保证我们有更好的机会来完成已经开始的工作。
    有充分理由能够特别指出这样一些重要问题来，在这些问题上，苏联代表团认为，会议能够立刻作出一致协议的决定，因为在这些问题上，各代表团的意见已经有了一定程度的一致。
    这是一些什么问题呢？
    （一）与会者表示赞成在朝鲜各地举行全朝鲜国民议会选举，这个选举必须使朝鲜人民有可能自由地表示他们的意志，并实现他们的要求在民主基础上统一国家的正当的愿望。自然，这次选举应该根据全朝鲜选举法来举行，这个选举法将规定普遍的选举权、秘密投票和在全朝鲜立法机构中的比例代表制度。
      （二）在讨论过程中，曾讨论了关于设立一个全朝鲜机构来准备和举行自由普选的建议。不可能设想，在发生了以往种种事件以后，可以不经过在朝鲜全国各地的充分准备和在不考虑到国内所存在的经济和政治特点的情况下，采取像举行普选这种对朝鲜极为重要的措施。
    有些代表团在这里已经表示了它们对于这个机构可能是什么样的机构、它的活动应该根据什么原则的意见。譬如，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就提出了一个建议，主张由北朝鲜与南朝鲜的代表组成全朝鲜委员会来准备并举行选举，并就采取紧急措施以重建并发展朝鲜两部分之间的经济与文化关系获致协议。假使会议在原则上同意为了上述目的而设立全朝鲜机构，那将是向前迈进了一步，因为假使没有这个机构，全朝鲜选举实际上不可能举行。至于这个机构的组成、职务和它进行活动所根据的原则等问题，可以另行讨论。
      （三）会议的参加者承认，任何解决朝鲜问题的方案都应该规定，一切外国武装部队撤离朝鲜。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就这个问题提出的建议规定，在举行全朝鲜选举以前，自朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。撤退外国军队问题在大韩民国代表团提出的建议里面也有反映，虽然这个建议中有保留意见，认为，美国军队的撤退“可以在选举之前开始，但是一定不要在朝鲜的统一政府在整个朝鲜实现完全的控制之前完成”。尽管这些建议之间存在分歧，由于会议的全体参加者都承认外国军队撤退的必要性，因此，假使会议在原则上表明它同意所有外国武装部队撤离朝鲜，那将是一个积极的因素。至于外国武装部队撤离北朝鲜和南朝鲜的具体限期，应该另行讨论。
      （四）所有与会者一致同意全朝鲜选举应该在一个国际机构的监督下举行。不过关于产生这个国际机构所应该遵循的程序，在会上有了不同的意见。中华人民共和国代表团提出的建议主张由一个其组成与朝鲜中立国监察委员会相同的中立国委员会来对朝鲜选举进行监督。苏联代表团支持这个建议，认为这符合于将为这个机构规定的目标。有一些与会者发言赞成委托联合国委员会来监督选举。
    苏联代表团认为：会议能够在原则上决定关于建立国际委员会以监督举行选举的问题。至于这个委员会的组成以及它的职权范围，可以进一步地交换意见，以达成协议。
      （五）所有与会者都指出了为防止破坏朝鲜停战协定和保证朝鲜的和平发展而创造必要条件的重要性。在这方面已经发表的意见是：假如对维护远东和平具有最大关心的国家承担适当的义务的话，朝鲜的和平发展就能有保障。这样就会有助于完成朝鲜的国家统一的工作。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的建议详细规定了这个重要问题的解决办法。
    显然，会议决不能避开这个和维护朝鲜和平有关的严重问题。在目前，会议已经能够就最关心保证朝鲜和平发展的国家必须承担适当的义务的问题通过决定了。至于具体地由哪些国家来承担上述义务以及这种义务的性质问题，应该另行讨论。
    苏联代表团认为，这些就是应该首先加以考虑的问题。代表们对一些与会者彼此的看法还有出入的原则也应仔细地考虑，并尽力寻求实际的办法来实行。苏联代表团无意低估这些分歧。
    存在分歧的是这样一些重要问题，譬如有必要在最近的将来建立一个权力及于全朝鲜人民的全朝鲜机构、自朝鲜撤退一切外国武装部队以及有关国家对朝鲜进一步的和平发展所必须的条件加以保证等——只要指出这一些就够了。
    苏联代表团认为，与会者必须努力调和他们的意见，并就这些原则达成彼此都能接受的协议。在这方面，苏联代表团认为，代表们现在能够就上述有关和平解决朝鲜问题的问题进行具体讨论了。同时，在一个相应的决定中把一些代表们在讨论过程中能够取得协议的根本问题列下来也是适当的。
    根据上述种种，苏联代表团认为有可能向会议提出下列决议草案供会议讨论：
    “日内瓦会议的参加者已就下列关于和平解决朝鲜问题的基本原则达成协议：
    一、为了统一朝鲜，并建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家，应在全朝鲜领土上举行自由选举。
    选举应在本协议缔结后六个月内举行。
    选举应该在秘密投票和普遍选举权的基础上进行。
    全朝鲜立法机构的代表名额应该和全朝鲜人口成比例。
    二、为准备和进行全朝鲜自由选举，并促进朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的和解，应建立由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和大韩民国代表组成的全朝鲜机构。
    这个机构的组成和任务有待进一步的研究。
    三、一切外国军队应在规定期间内撤出朝鲜。
      一切外国军队在全朝鲜自由选举以前撤出北朝鲜和南朝鲜的时限和阶段问题，有待进一步的研究。
    四、应该决定成立适当的国际委员会来监督全朝鲜自由选举的举行。
    这个委员会的组成有待进一步的研究。
    五、鉴于防止对朝鲜和平的任何破坏的重要性，应该认为对维护远东和平有最直接关系的国家有必要承担义务，来保证朝鲜的和平发展，这将促进朝鲜全国统一问题的解决。
    哪些国家将承担义务来保证朝鲜的和平发展以及这种义务的性质问题，有待进一步的研究。”
    目前苏联代表团的建议强调地提出了这样一些问题，在这些问题上，苏联代表团认为，有可能通过一致的决定。不过，从这个建议的本文中可以明显地看出：即使通过了这些一般性的规定，仍然还有一些问题没有解决，而在这些问题上要是不达成协议是不可能实现朝鲜的国家统一的。大家不应该低估目前形势的错综复杂的性质。
    最后我认为有必要详细谈一下美国代表在五月二十八日会议上的发言。在保卫联合国组织的借口下，美国代表尽力想为美国对朝鲜的侵略，以及联合国组织直接地并一再地破坏联合国宪章的那些非法行动辩护。美国代表尽力想把美国对朝鲜的侵略说成是执行集体安全的原则，当然要不歪曲事实是做不到这一点的。
    美国代表竟硬说苏联否认集体安全的原则，而大家都知道，苏联是捍卫集体安全原则的最积极的战士，它过去是，现在仍然是拥护实际应用上述原则的。没有必要再重复苏联在第二次世界大战以前的时期内为集体抵抗侵略进行斗争这个大家都十分清楚的事实了。大家知道，在第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联也一直没有停止过它的反对美国所奉行的把世界分裂成为彼此对立的军事集团的政策的斗争。
    苏联最近所采取的保障集体安全的步骤是大家普遍知道的。苏联政府提出了缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议，并表示愿意加入北大西洋公约，因为我们认为，像苏联这样的爱好和平的国家加入了北大西洋公约以后，会把北大西洋公约组织从一个使这个国家集团与那个国家集团彼此对立的侵略组织变成一个集体安全的机构。此外，在日内瓦会议上，苏联还宣布它支持中华人民共和国代表团的发言中所表示的保障亚洲各国人民集体安全的愿望。
    大家知道，所有这些目的在于保障所有国家
  ——不论他们国家的社会制度如何——的真正集体
  安全的步骤，遭到了美国官方人士的顽固反对。这
  些都是真正的事实。
    谈到联合国，苏联作为这个组织的创始者之一，一向尽力促使这个组织成为保障和平与国际安全的真正组织，因为联合国宪章、它的基本原则以及这一国际组织所以成立的宗旨都要求这样做。正因为如此，苏联正在进行斗争来反对把联合国变成美国或其他国家的某些集团的侵略政策的工具的企图，这种企图特别表现在这件事上：联合国通过了批准美国侵略朝鲜的非法的决议。
    美国代表即使是在对联合国施行粗暴压力的时候，即使是在硬要对联合国宪章的主要条款进行可耻的破坏——譬如在朝鲜问题以及关于中华人民共和国在联合国的权利问题上——的时候，也尽力想把自己说成是联合国的保护者。但是如果人们破坏了联合国的原则和联合国宪章本身，他们就不能支持和巩固联合国的国际权威了。在美国的压力下进行的这些破坏，损害了联合国的基础。而苏联在和破坏联合国的基本原则及破坏联合国宪章的行为作斗争的同时，维护了联合国的荣誉和权力。
    在这里有人企图把美国统治集团说成是为正义与和平而战的战士，说成是人类权利的捍卫者和道义原则的守护者。不过，很久以来大家就知道，言论只有在符合行动和事实的时候，才有价值或意义。但是在这儿我们看到的情况却不同。就在现在，当和平解决朝鲜问题的办法还没有讨论完的时候，已经又发生了美国进行侵略的新威胁——这次是在东南亚地区——只要指出这一点就足够了。
    美国代表在结束发言时表示全力支持南朝鲜代表提出的建议，但是，十分明显，这些建议是和朝鲜的实际情况不相符合的，因此不能作为日内瓦会议的决议的基础。
    在苏联代表团方面的努力之下，列入决议草案以提请代表们注意的只是这样一些条款：这些条款可以作为日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的决议的基础，假如大家表现了对于达成协议有诚意的话，同时，苏联代表团还建议继续就争论中的问题交换意见。
    苏联代表团认为：通过上述决议将推进会议今后的工作，并将对达成符合于朝鲜人民的利益和加强世界和平的利益的协议有所贡献。
