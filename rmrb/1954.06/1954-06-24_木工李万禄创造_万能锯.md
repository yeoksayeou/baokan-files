Carpenter Li Wanlu, a Communist Party member at Fushun Fourth Engineering Company, has created a new type of "universal saw." The "universal saw" has a wide range of processing capabilities. With the exception of mortising and manual installation, it can handle almost all carpentry operations in civil engineering and construction. By simply pushing the wood material through the "universal saw's" machine platform, it can complete the three processes of rabbeting, tenoning, and cutting in one go, producing finished products such as window frames, door frames, and flooring. This "universal saw" is a highly efficient, comprehensive woodworking machine. For example, its efficiency in processing window frames is approximately 43 times higher than the efficiency of existing separate woodworking machines, and it can replace the manual labor of more than 140 carpenters.

    木工李万禄创造“万能锯”
    抚顺第四工程公司木工、共产党员李万禄创造了一种新型“万能锯”。“万能锯”加工的范围很广，除了凿眼和手工安装外，土木建筑工程中所有的木工操作几乎都可以担任。只要将木料推过“万能锯”的机台，一次就能完成拉肩、切膀、开榫三道工序，加工出窗料、门料、地板等成品。这个“万能锯”是效率高的综合性的木工机器，如加工窗料的效率，约超过现有分项木工机械加工效率的四十三倍，约能代替一百四十多个木工的手工劳动量。（附图片）
