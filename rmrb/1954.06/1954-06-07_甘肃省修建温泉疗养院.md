    Gansu Province's first hot spring sanatorium has recently begun construction. The sanatorium is located on the left side of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway in Luomen Town, Wushan County, nestled against the mountains and beside the water, with a beautiful environment. There are six large springs here, with an ample supply of hot spring water. The planned construction area of the sanatorium is more than 9,900 square meters, including a treatment department and four ward buildings, with individual and collective bathhouses, as well as a dining hall, club, and laundry for patients. The construction project will be completed next spring. Once completed, it will be able to accommodate 400 patients for recuperation and can also provide outpatient treatment.
