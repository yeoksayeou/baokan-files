As it is necessary to strengthen political and legal work in order to consolidate the revolutionary regime, it is necessary to train competent political and legal cadres to strengthen political and legal work. As such, the importance of political and legal education should not be difficult to recognize. However, I find that my understanding of political and legal work and political and legal education is still insufficient. It was not until I participated in the National Conference on Political and Legal Education convened by the Higher Education Department of the Central People's Government that I had a more correct understanding.

I.

The characteristics of political and legal work lie in its strong class nature and policy orientation. Therefore, it must closely rely on the strong leadership of the Party and must be in the hands of cadres who are loyal to the country and the people. The task of political and legal workers is to constantly strengthen the state apparatus and strive to ensure the realization of the state's general task during the transition period.

The characteristics of political and legal work bring corresponding characteristics to political and legal education.

First, political and legal science has a strong class nature and policy orientation. The old political and legal ideological system represents the interests of the reactionary ruling class, and the old political and legal education trained service tools for the reactionary ruling class. Therefore, the people's political and legal education must establish new political and legal sciences on the basis of thoroughly negating the old political and legal ideological system and thoroughly criticizing the old political and legal theories; teaching must be conducted on the basis of close integration with the actual construction of political and legal affairs. Any idea or practice that follows the old system and ignores reality will damage political and legal education.

Second, political and legal education must especially strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism theory and the Party's line and policies, so that students can understand the laws of social development, clearly recognize the direction of national development, deeply understand the policies of the Party and the state, and become agitators, propagandists, and fighters who safeguard the Party and government's policies, maintain the socialist legal system, and defend national laws and disciplines, and actively serve the state's general task during the transition period.

Third, political and legal education must especially strengthen the political and ideological education and organizational education of all teachers and students, so that students have a firm working-class stand, a political quality of serving the people wholeheartedly, and an ideological style of selflessness, hard work, seeking truth from facts, and maintaining close ties with the masses, so that students have abundant political enthusiasm, a high sense of political responsibility, and good organization and discipline.

In the past, I did not truly recognize the importance of political and legal work. I had a fairly serious objective point of view, and my own requirements as a political and legal educator were not strict enough. After correctly recognizing the importance of political and legal work and political and legal education, as well as their significance, I will correct my past shortcomings with a high sense of responsibility.

II.

In order to realize the general task of political and legal work during the transition period, it is completely correct and necessary to adopt the policy of focusing on short-term rotational training of on-the-job cadres in the next two or three years, and paying close attention to the training of students in specialized schools and above. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in the "Instruction on Strengthening the Cultural Education of Cadres": "Massively training and promoting worker-peasant cadres, and systematically improving their political, cultural, and professional levels, so that they become the backbone of various construction undertakings, is a major political and organizational task for implementing the Party's general line during the transition period." From the perspective of political and legal work, relying on worker-peasant cadres with a firm working-class stand and rich experience in class struggle is of particular importance. These cadres have made great contributions to the Party and the country in the past revolutionary struggles and have been strictly tempered politically. In the restoration and construction undertakings and various social reform movements in recent years, they have continued to stand at the forefront of the struggle and have made many achievements for the people. Many of them are the backbone of political and legal work. However, their weakness is that their cultural and theoretical levels are low, and they are not familiar with policies and business. If short-term rotational training methods are adopted to rapidly improve them, they will surely play a greater role in future socialist construction undertakings.

The School of Political Science and Law has the dual task of combining short-term rotational training and long-term training. As far as the current conditions of the Beijing School of Political Science and Law are concerned, the task is undoubtedly arduous. Therefore, we must clearly recognize the important significance of focusing on short-term rotational training and be good at organizing forces to complete this task. As for the training of undergraduate students with a longer academic system, we also recognize that it is of vital importance because only in this way can we continuously supplement new forces, strengthen the ranks of political and legal workers, and adapt to the country's increasing development and increasingly improving requirements for political and legal workers.

At the National Conference on Political and Legal Education, after discussions and exchanges, I was enlightened that: to implement the policy of focusing on short-term rotational training, it is necessary not only to have a clear understanding of this policy, but also to integrate with the workers and peasants in terms of ideological feelings in order to strive to overcome difficulties and complete this important task. I did not do enough in this regard in the past, which caused certain losses to my work. This is something I should work hard on in the future.

Increasing the proportion of worker-peasant students among undergraduate students is another aspect of the training policy that has great significance and is also one of the signs of teaching reform in universities. Since political and legal work has a strong class nature and policy orientation, worker-peasant students, after mastering systematic Marxist-Leninist theory, improving their policy and ideological level, and studying political and legal science, will be able to serve the people better and train themselves more quickly to become the strong backbone of socialist construction.

Worker-peasant students will encounter many difficulties when they first enter universities. This requires us to adopt various methods to help them, wholeheartedly care for their studies and lives, and pay attention to overcoming the erroneous attitudes of indifference or contempt that may arise on the part of leaders and teaching staff.

III.

In order to realize the basic tasks of political and legal education, it is necessary to further implement the teaching policy of "integrating theory with practice" and "combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's reality." Regarding the issue of learning from the Soviet Union, my ideological understanding has undergone a process of development. Although I originally recognized that all work should learn from the Soviet Union, in the past I always felt that some work could be learned more first, but as for short-term rotational training and two-year specialized courses, I felt that there was no place to learn, and I had to start by exploring from the existing foundation. However, the Teaching Experience Discussion Conference of the Renmin University of China reversed my one-sided understanding. Attaching importance to China's reality, closely linking with reality, and gradually developing and enriching our political and legal science on the basis of summarizing practical experience is undoubtedly completely correct; at the same time, I also recognize that China's reality—our people's democratic system and revolutionary legal system—as pointed out in the "Main Tasks of Political and Legal Work in 1954," are developing and will develop rapidly. In order to ensure the realization of the state's general task during the transition period, following the Second National Judicial Conference, the Second National Civil Affairs Conference and the Second National Procuratorial Work Conference were convened successively. Recently, the Supreme People's Court of the Central Committee convened a symposium on adjudication work. Through the above-mentioned conferences, not only have the guiding principles and tasks of various tasks become clearer, but also all aspects of work have achieved great development. These developments show that our integration with China's reality does not simply involve integrating with the existing reality, but more importantly, it must be able to adapt to this development trend, so as to be able to integrate with the actual needs and situations that are already emerging and will greatly develop in the face of new tasks. Comprehensively, systematically, and unremittingly studying the advanced political and legal science of the Soviet Union can help us summarize our own practical experience, making the people's democratic legal system increasingly sound and complete.

Of course, learning from the Soviet Union and systematically conducting political and legal teaching currently has many difficulties. But we must have the spirit of creating conditions and actively overcoming difficulties, striving to establish a solid foundation for political and legal education in four or five years. As far as the School of Political Science and Law is concerned, the next four years, which is also the study period of the first class of undergraduate students of the School of Political Science and Law, will be our most difficult days, because we still have some difficulties in terms of teachers and teaching materials. However, as long as we can successfully get through this period, our political and legal education will have favorable conditions for development. At the beginning, the Renmin University of China also had many difficulties. The great achievements made in the past four years are the result of constantly overcoming difficulties and constantly correcting various ideological deviations.

While implementing the teaching policy of "combining the advanced experience of the Soviet Union with China's reality," it is necessary to expose and criticize reactionary political and legal theories in order to further draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the bourgeoisie. This is an indispensable and important task in the process of building new jurisprudence. I myself am deeply stained with old political and legal theories, and ideological transformation is even more arduous, but striving to do this work well is still the responsibility of every political and legal science worker.

IV.

Strengthening the ideological leadership of the working class, strengthening collective leadership, correctly carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthening unity are the decisive keys to completing the basic tasks of political and legal education. In the past, I had many shortcomings in these areas. First of all, I was unable to seriously study and deeply understand the Party's policies and instructions, and earnestly implement them in my work; at the same time, I failed to carry out criticism and self-criticism well in my work to improve my leadership methods and leadership style. In the future, I will definitely strive to implement the Party's various policies under the leadership of the Party, strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and Soviet legal theory, expose and criticize bourgeois jurisprudence, and continue to transform my own ideology and style, in order to further unite all teachers, give full play to their greatest strength and creativity, and also further give play to my own enthusiasm and role.

Chairman Mao emphasized the importance of strengthening the state apparatus in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Over the past few years, we have followed Chairman Mao's instructions and achieved great victories in all aspects. Since the general task of the state during the transition period was put forward, our task has become even more important, and the National Conference on Political and Legal Education has clearly put forward and resolved important issues such as the guiding principles, tasks, and training goals. In the future, we should run our political and legal education with full confidence, and strive to complete this historical task and build a great socialist motherland.

    对政法教育方针任务的一些体会
    北京政法学院院长　钱端升
    要巩固革命政权，就必须加强政法工作；要加强政法工作，就必须培养胜任的政法工作干部。如此，政法教育的重要性应该是不难认识的了。但我发觉，我对政法工作和政法教育的认识还很不够。直到参加了中央人民政府高等教育部召开的全国政法教育会议，我才有了比较正确的认识。一
    政法工作的特点在于它具有强烈的阶级性和政策性。因此，它必须紧紧依靠党的坚强领导，必须掌握在忠实于国家和人民群众的干部的手里。而政法工作者的任务，则在于不断强化国家机器，为保障国家在过渡时期的总任务的实现而奋斗。
    政法工作的特点给政法教育带来了相应的特点。
    第一，政治法律科学具有强烈的阶级性和政策性，旧的政法思想体系代表反动统治阶级的利益，旧的政法教育是为反动统治阶级培养服务工具的。因此，人民的政法教育必须在彻底否定旧的政法思想体系，彻底批判旧的政法理论的条件下建立新的政治法律科学；必须在密切结合政法建设实际的基础上进行教学。任何因循旧制和忽视实际的想法和作法，都会给政法教育带来损害。
    第二，政法教育必须特别加强马克思列宁主义理论和党的路线政策的教育，使学生通晓社会发展的规律，明确认识国家发展的方向，深刻理解党和国家的政策，成为维护党和政府的方针、维护社会主义法制、维护国家法纪的鼓动者、宣传者及战士，积极为国家过渡时期的总任务服务。
    第三，政法教育必须特别加强全体师生的政治思想教育和组织教育，使学生具有坚定的工人阶级立场、忠心耿耿地为人民服务的政治品质和大公无私、艰苦奋斗、实事求是、联系群众的思想作风，使学生具有丰富的政治热情、高度的政治责任心和良好的组织性纪律性。
    过去我没有真正认识到政法工作的重要性。我有着相当严重的客观主义的思想，对于我自己作为
  一个政法教育工作者的要求则是不够严格的。在正确地认识了政法工作和政法教育的重要性以及它们
  的意义之后，我将以高度负责的态度来纠正我过去
  的缺点。二
    为实现过渡时期政法工作的总任务，在今后两三年内采取以短期轮训在职干部为主，并切实注意培养专科以上学校学生的方针，是完全正确和必要的。中共中央在“关于加强干部文化教育工作的指示”中指出：“大量培养与提拔工农干部，和有计划地提高他们的政治、文化、业务水平，使他们成为各项建设事业中的骨干，乃是贯彻党在过渡时期总路线的一项重大的政治任务和组织任务。”从政法工作来看，依靠具有坚定的工人阶级立场和丰富的阶级斗争经验的工农干部，更具有其特殊重要的意义。这些干部在过去的革命斗争中对党和国家有过很大的贡献，并且在政治上受过严格的锻炼。在最近几年的恢复和建设事业和各项社会改革运动中，他们继续站在斗争的前列，为人民作出许多的成绩。他们之中的许多人正是政法工作的骨干。但他们的弱点是文化水平和理论水平较低，对政策、业务不够熟悉，如采取短期轮训办法，迅速提高他们，则他们在今后社会主义建设事业中，必将发挥更大的作用。
    政法学院负有短期轮训和长期培养相结合的双重任务。就北京政法学院目前条件来说，任务无疑是艰巨的。因此我们必须明确认识短期轮训为主的重要意义，并善于组织力量去完成这个任务。至于对较长年制的本科学生的培养，我们同样认识到它具有十分重要的意义，因为只有这样，才能不断地补充新的力量，壮大政法工作者的队伍，适应国家日益发展和日益提高的对于政法工作者的要求。
    在全国政法教育会议上，经过座谈讨论，使我得到启发的是：要贯彻短期轮训为主的方针，不但需要对这个方针有清楚的认识，还必须在思想感情上和工农打成一片，才能努力克服困难，完成这一重要任务。我在这一方面过去作得还不够，因而给工作带来了一定的损失。这是我今后应该努力的一点。
    在本科学生中增加工农学生比重，这又是培养方针中具有重大意义的另一方面，也是高等学校教学改革的标志之一。因为政法工作既然具有强烈的阶级性、政策性，则工农学生在掌握了系统的马克思列宁主义理论，提高了政策思想水平和学习了政治法律科学之后，就会更好地为人民服务，更快地锻炼自己成为社会主义建设事业的坚强骨干。
    工农成份学生入高等学校学习，一开始是会有不少困难的。这就要求我们采取各种办法帮助他们，满腔热情地去关怀他们的学习和生活，注意克服领导方面和教学人员可能产生的漠不关心或轻视他们的错误态度。
  三为了实现政法教育工作的基本任务，必须进一步贯彻“理论联系实际”、“学习苏联先进经验与中国实际相结合”的教学方针。在学习苏联问题上，我的思想认识是有一个发展过程的。虽然我原也认识到一切工作都要学习苏联，但过去总觉得有些工作可以先学多学，至于短期轮训和二年制专修科则有学不上之感，得首先从现有基础上摸索。但中国人民大学教学经验讨论会扭转了我的片面认识。重视中国实际，密切联系实际，在总结实际经验的基础上逐步发展、丰富我们的政治法律科学，这无疑是完全对的；同时我也认识到：中国的实际——我们的人民民主制度和革命法制，如“一九五四年政法工作的主要任务”文件中所指出的，正在和将要迅速的发展。为了保障国家在过渡时期的总任务的实现，继第二届全国司法会议后，先后召开了第二次全国民政会议，第二届全国检察工作会议，最近中央最高人民法院又召开了审判工作座谈会；通过上述会议，不仅各项工作的方针任务更加明确，各项业务也都获得了巨大的发展。这些发展情况表明：我们结合中国实际，并不单单结合现有的，更重要的是要能适应这种发展趋势，以求能够结合已经萌芽的在新任务面前必将大大发展的实际需要和情况，而全面地系统地不懈地学习苏联先进的政治法律科学，就能帮助我们总结自己的实际经验，使人民民主法制日益健全完备。
    当然，学习苏联，系统地进行政治法律教学，目前困难是不少的。但我们必须有创造条件积极克服困难的精神，争取在四、五年内为政法教育树立巩固的基础。就政法学院来说，最近四年，也就是政法学院第一班本科生的学习时期，将是我们的最艰苦的日子，因为我们在教师、教材方面还有些困难。但是，只要我们能够胜利地度过这一个时期，我们的政法教育便有了有利的发展条件。中国人民大学一开始时，困难也是不少的，四年来所获得的巨大成就，就是不断克服困难，并不断纠正各种思想偏向的结果。
    在贯彻执行“学习苏联先进经验与中国实际相结合”的教学方针的同时，必须揭露批判反动的政法理论，以进一步划清工人阶级和资产阶级的思想界限，这是在建设新法学过程中必不可少的一项重要工作。我自己沾染旧政法理论较深，思想改造也更是艰巨，但是努力做好这一工作，仍然是我们每一个政治法律科学工作者的责任。四
    加强工人阶级思想领导，加强集体领导，正确地开展批评和自我批评，加强团结，是完成政法教育基本任务的决定关键。我过去在这些方面是有不少缺点的。首先是没有能够认真钻研和深刻体会党的政策指示，在工作中切实加以贯彻；同时我在工作中还未能很好展开批评和自我批评，改进领导方法和领导作风，今后我一定在党的领导下努力贯彻执行党的各项政策，加强对马克思列宁主义理论和苏联法学理论的学习，揭露批判资产阶级法学，继续改造自己的思想和作风，以进一步团结全体教师，发挥其最大的力量和创造性，同时也进一步发挥自己的积极性和作用。
    毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中强调提出了强化国家机器的重要性。几年以来，我们遵照毛主席的指示，从而在各方面取得了伟大的胜利。国家在过渡时期的总任务提出以后，我们的任务更为重大了，而全国政法教育会议又已明确地提出和解决了方针任务、培养目标等重要问题，今后我们应该满怀信心地办好我们的政法教育，为完成这一个历史性的任务，为建设伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
