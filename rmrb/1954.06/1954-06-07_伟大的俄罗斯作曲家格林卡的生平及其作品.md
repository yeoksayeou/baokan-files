    The Life and Works of the Great Russian Composer Glinka
    Zhao Feng, Secretary-General of the Chinese Musicians Association
    Editor's Note: June 1st is the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian composer Glinka. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, and the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries are scheduled to hold a memorial meeting in the capital on the 7th, and perform Glinka's important musical works.
    Glinka is compared to Pushkin, just as Pushkin is called the "father of Russian literature," Glinka is called the "father of Russian music." Just as Pushkin developed Russian literature and language to a new historical stage, Glinka raised Russian music to a new historical stage, laying the foundation for the Russian school of music, enriching the treasure house of world musical culture, and expressing the lofty heroic image and great patriotic ideas of the Russian people through music.
    On June 1, 1804, Glinka, whom the great Hungarian composer Liszt called the "prophet-patriarch," was born in the family of a landowner in Novospasskoye. His father was a retired military officer, his uncle organized a small band that often performed at home, and his grandmother told him stories and sang folk songs. He spent his childhood in such an environment. The stories of Russia's war against Napoleon and its victory had a great impact on the childhood of Glinka. He loved folk songs very much. When he did not yet have the knowledge of band arrangement, he began to experiment with adapting folk songs into orchestral music.
    Glinka was a diligent person. Like any master, he was trained through hard work and practice. In 1817, he went to St. Petersburg. In addition to continuing to study piano, he also studied violin. The famous poet, Decembrist, and friend of Pushkin, Küchelbecker, taught Glinka to study Russian literature and gave him great ideological inspiration. In 1825, the Decembrist uprising occurred, and he went to the uprising square. This uprising had a profound impact on Glinka. In 1823, after traveling to the Caucasus, he returned home, systematically studied Western European classical composers, and composed music for his uncle's band. In 1824, he took a job in the Ministry of Communications, began amateur writing, and studied singing. In St. Petersburg, he associated with poets Pushkin, Zhukovsky, etc. At that time, he was already an outstanding linguist and a good algebraist, and he studied natural sciences, with some research in zoology.
    From Glinka's works of this period, one can already see the process of the formation of a unique style. The composer's ingenious efforts in exploring can be seen from the bright and attractive melodies, harmonies, and tones. His popular song "The Flame of Hope Burns in the Blood" (composed in 1821, poem by Pushkin) depicts the anxiety and excitement of love and the feelings and images of hope with a simple and touching melody.
    In 1828, he went to Italy, studied Italian opera, and began to think about writing a "national" opera, which would use Russia's colorful tones as a source of themes. We know that in Russia at that time, the upper class only knew Italian opera and German music. After systematically contacting Italian opera, Glinka understood that the passionate, gorgeous, and beautiful melodies in Italian opera were rooted in the local soil. From this time on, he began to conceive his national opera.
    In 1833, he went to Germany and studied music theory there. The following year, he returned to China due to his father's death. The poet Zhukovsky introduced him to write the story of the patriotic hero peasant "Ivan Susanin" into an opera. He spent two years, with "Russian and Polish music often flashing in his mind," writing the first Russian national opera. In November 1836, it was staged at the Royal Opera House. This opera, which depicts an ordinary Russian peasant, and a patriotic peasant, also surprised and displeased the Russian rulers at the time. Therefore, in order for this opera to be staged, it was renamed "A Life for the Tsar" before it was approved. At the first performance, although the Tsar and his family were present, the royal critics said that this great opera with a moving national style was "the music of coachmen." How did Glinka respond to this slander? He said: "What does it matter, coachmen are more useful than gentlemen!"
    "Ivan Susanin" is undoubtedly a gem in the world of opera. Susanin represents the character of the great Russian people, who are unyielding and uncompromising in the face of adversity. The opera is full of drama, and the contrasting scenes and emotional changes attract people's attention from beginning to end. At the opening, the Russian peasants bid farewell to the militiamen, which is a magnificent chorus, a generous song of conscription. The militiamen leave, the peasants disperse, leaving Antonida, Susanin's daughter, singing the famous lyrical tune and rondo "Ah! Field, my field," remembering her fiancé who is fighting: "He is alive, I believe. ... The days of suffering will pass, the pain of oppression will disappear, and joy will rise like the bright sun." This piece portrays a simple girl's loyalty to love and her desire for a peaceful working life. But the music changes, and the Polish nobles who launched the invasion of Russia are dancing a waltz. Afterwards, the third act culminates in a quartet by Susanin and his adopted son, daughter, and daughter's fiancé. The engaged couple met, the enemy was temporarily driven away, "the storm has disappeared above our heads, and the sun shines on our thatched cottage," and they are preparing for the wedding banquet. But at the pinnacle of this happiness, the Polish invading army arrives, and Susanin is captured by the enemy to lead the way. The famous wedding chorus and Antonida's solo are a beautiful chapter of music: the chorus cannot suppress the joyful rhythm of celebrating the wedding, but it is surprised by the bride
  "Why are you shedding tears?" The sad solo and chorus form such a dramatic contrast: "A fierce enemy broke into my home and took my father away!" The neighbors and Antonida's fiancé are all indignant and go to pursue the enemy. After swearing to fight for the motherland with full confidence, Susanin, who led the enemy to a dead end in the great forest, knew that he would not escape death in the snowy night: "Death is near, but I am not afraid, I have fulfilled my responsibility. Rise, my dawn... Look at my Russia, you warm her with your light. Let me live a little longer, give me strength one last time when I die, my land, let my bones be with you..."
    In 1838, Glinka began to prepare for the creation of his second opera "Ruslan and Ludmila" (poem by Pushkin). Just as many typical Russian and Polish tones and rhythms appeared in "Ivan Susanin," this opera quoted oriental music, Persian-style chorus, Turkish-style dance music, and the tones of Tatar folk songs. Technically speaking, Western European critics said that the style has Italian-style suitability for human voice and beauty, French-style gorgeousness and bold innovation, and German-style rigor and highly skilled technology.
    In 1844, he went to France and Spain. In France, he had exchanges with the French composer Berlioz. As a critic, Berlioz gave Glinka's music a very high evaluation.
    In 1848, Glinka wrote the immortal "Kamarinskaya" symphonic fantasia. This can be said to be the beginning of the development of the Russian symphonic school. This, like the overtures of the two operas he wrote before and later
  (1851) written "Night in Madrid," pointed out the fundamental direction of the Russian symphonic style. Tchaikovsky said that "Kamarinskaya" "laid the cornerstone of Russian symphonic creation," and that the other interludes written by Glinka are: "The revival of Beethoven's handwriting, each piece is a small picture from a master, and they are symphonic masterpieces." The Kamarinskaya dance is based on a folk wedding song and a dance. This piece of music vividly expresses the life and character of ordinary Russian people.
    On February 15, 1857, Glinka died in Berlin and was buried in St. Petersburg.
    Glinka's life adhered to his own proposition on musical creation:
  "The foundation of a composer's creation is the music of the people. It is the people who create music, and the composer just compiles it." Although his music does not directly quote many folk tunes, he wrote many original tunes that are very expressive and infectious, but these tunes have strong national emotions and tones. The harmony of his music perfectly combines those tunes with unique personalities, and his orchestration is rich, powerful and colorful. His music is very dramatic, but there is no exaggeration in sound effects and affectation in emotions, but it is often the first to focus on describing thoughts and feelings with perfect and highly expressive melodies.
    Glinka's progressive democratic ideas brought him close to the people and understood life. He inherited the tradition of Russian people's art, followed his ideological pioneers, expressed the life of the Russian people with music with the deepest love; and expressed the character of the Russian people with music with profound knowledge of life. Together with the progressive democrats of his time, he opposed the ruling policy of the Russian feudal aristocracy to fool the people, and embodied this belief in his musical creation. Therefore, Glinka gave his successors the greatest influence. The composers of the "Mighty Handful" took "Glinka and people's nature" as their banner, and Tchaikovsky gave his music a very high evaluation.
    The people's nature and national character expressed in Glinka's creation made great writers and critics of the time, such as Pushkin, Gogol, Belinsky, Stasov, and even the great Gorky, give positive evaluations to Glinka's creative path and creative methods. Gorky affectionately called him "Magician Glinka." His idea of using folk music as the fundamental element and source of inspiration for composer's music creation is still of great significance today.
    Chinese musicians commemorate this master in the history of music with great respect, because today, when we are striving to inherit our national musical traditions and create and develop our new people's musical culture, Glinka's activities as a pioneer and pioneer of the Russian school of music, his creative ideas, and his works that highly artistically reflect the life and spirit of the Russian people, are models we must learn from. Chinese music students are greedily studying Glinka's works, and Glinka's opera music has become an important part of the repertoire of every vocal student and vocalist. This year, on the 150th anniversary of the birth of the great composer, young Chinese orchestras, choirs, and soloists performed Glinka's orchestral and vocal works in our capital. This will play a huge role in further understanding this master and learning from the great achievements of Russian classical music, and in further strengthening cultural exchanges and enhancing the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    伟大的俄罗斯作曲家格林卡的生平及其作品
    中国音乐家协会秘书长  赵沨
    编者按：六月一日是俄罗斯伟大的作曲家格林卡诞生一百五十周年纪念日。中苏友好协会总会、中国音乐家协会、苏联对外文化协会定于七日在首都举行纪念会，并演奏格林卡的重要音乐作品。
    格林卡，人们把他和普希金并称，像称普希金为“俄罗斯文学之父”一样，称格林卡为“俄罗斯音乐之父”。因为他像普希金把俄国的文学和语言发展到一个新的历史阶段一样，把俄罗斯音乐提高到一个新的历史阶段，奠定了音乐上的俄罗斯学派的基础，丰富了世界音乐文化的宝库，用音乐表现了俄罗斯人民崇高的英雄形象和伟大的爱国主义的思想。
    一八○四年六月一日，这被伟大的匈牙利作曲家李斯特称为“先知——祖师”的格林卡生在诺沃斯帕斯克一个地主的家庭里。他的父亲是退职的军官，舅父自己组织一个小乐队经常在家里表演，外祖母为他讲故事，唱民歌，他就在这样的薰陶中度过了童年。俄罗斯对拿破仑的战争和胜利的故事，给童年的格林卡以极大的影响。他非常喜爱民歌，当他还不具备乐队编谱知识的时候，便开始了把民歌改编为管弦乐的试验。
    格林卡是个勤恳的人，他像任何一个大师一样，是从勤学苦练中锻炼出来的。他一八一七年到了彼得堡，除了继续学习钢琴以外，还学习过提琴。著名的诗人、十二月党人、普希金的朋友克有赫尔伯克尔教导格林卡学习俄国文学，在思想上给他很大的启发。一八二五年十二月党人起义，他曾到起义广场去过。这次起义，给予格林卡很深刻的影响。一八二三年他到高加索旅行后又回到家里，对西欧古典作曲家进行了系统的研究，并为他舅父的乐队作曲。一八二四年到交通部任职，开始了业余的写作并且学习唱歌。在彼得堡和诗人普希金、儒可夫斯基等交往。那时，他已是一个卓越的语言学家和很好的代数家，并且学习自然科学，对于动物学很有一些研究。
    从这个时期的格林卡的作品中，已经可以看出一个独特的风格正在形成的过程。从光采的和富有吸引力的曲调、和声及音调上都看得出作曲家努力摸索的匠心。他的通俗的歌曲“希望的火焰在血液中燃烧”（一八二一年作，普希金诗）的单纯的曲调动人地刻划出了爱情的焦灼和激动，希望的情感和形象。
    一八二八年他到意大利，研究了意大利的歌剧，并且开始想写作一个“民族的”歌剧，这个歌剧要以俄罗斯的多采的音调作为主题的泉源。我们知道，在那时的俄罗斯，上流社会只知道意大利歌剧和德国音乐。格林卡在系统地接触了意大利歌剧后，了解了意大利歌剧中的热情奔放、华丽柔美的曲调是植根于本乡本土的土壤中的。从这时起，他便开始构思他的民族的歌剧了。
      一八三三年他到德国，并且在那里学习了音乐技术理论。第二年因父丧回国，诗人儒可夫斯基介绍他把“伊凡·苏沙宁”这个爱国英雄农民的故事写成歌剧。他用两年的时间，在“俄国的和波兰的音乐常在脑海中闪过”的情况下，写成了第一个俄罗斯民族歌剧。一八三六年十一月，在皇家歌剧院上演。这个歌剧，描写了一个普通的俄国农民，并且是一个爱国的农民，但也使得当时的俄国统治者们吃惊和不悦了。因此，为了这个歌剧能够上演，改了一个“为沙皇捐躯的人”的名字才被批准。首次公演时，虽然沙皇全家都到了场，但御用的批评家们都说这具有动人的民族风格的伟大歌剧是“马车夫的音乐”。而格林卡是怎样回答这种污蔑的呢？他说：“这有什么关系，马车夫比老爷们要有用些！”
    “伊凡·苏沙宁”无疑是世界歌剧中的一块宝石，苏沙宁代表了伟大的俄罗斯人民的性格，威武不屈，临难不苟。歌剧充满着戏剧性，强烈对比的场面和情感的变换自始至终吸引着人们的注意。开幕时，俄罗斯农民送别民兵们，是雄壮的合唱，慷慨的征歌。民兵走了，农民散了，留下安东尼达、苏沙宁的女儿，唱着那著名的抒情调和回旋曲“呵！田野，我的田野”，怀念着出征的未婚夫：“他活着，我相信。……苦难的日子将过去，痛苦的压迫将消逝，欢乐将升起来，像光明的太阳。”这个曲子刻划了一个朴素的少女对爱情的忠贞和对和平劳动生活的愿望。但音乐变了，发动侵略俄国的波兰贵族们在跳着圆舞。之后，第三幕以苏沙宁和他的义子、女儿、女儿的未婚夫的四重唱为顶点。未婚夫妻会面了，敌人被暂时赶走了，“雷雨在我们头顶上消失，太阳照耀着我们的草房”，他们准备结婚的宴会了。但就在这幸福的顶点上，波兰的侵略军队来了，苏沙宁被敌人抓去带路了。著名的婚礼合唱和安东尼达的独唱是一章美丽的音乐：合唱抑压不住那庆祝新婚的快乐的节奏，但却惊讶新娘
  “为什么，你泪下如流？”悲伤的独唱和合唱形成了那么戏剧性的对比：“凶恶的敌人闯进了我的家，抓走了我的父亲！”邻人们和安东尼达的未婚夫都义愤填膺地去追击敌人了。在充满信心为祖国战斗的宣誓之后，把敌人带到大森林的绝路中去的苏沙宁，在大雪纷飞的深夜，知道自己也将不免于死亡：“死近了，但我并不惧怕，我尽了我的责任。升起吧，我的朝霞……看我的俄罗斯，你用光芒温暖了她。我再活一会儿吧，我将死时再最后一次给我以力量吧，我的大地，让我的尸骨与你同在……”
    一八三八年，格林卡开始准备创作他第二部歌剧“卢斯兰和留德米拉”（普希金诗）。像“伊凡·苏沙宁”中出现了许多俄罗斯和波兰的典型的音调和节奏一样，这个歌剧中引用了东方的音乐，波斯风的合唱，土耳其风的舞曲，塔塔尔民歌的音调。从技术上说，西欧的批评家说风格上具有意大利式的适于人声和美丽，法国式的华丽而大胆革新，德国式的严谨和高度熟练的技术。
    一八四四年他到法国和西班牙，在法国曾和法国作曲家裴辽士往还，作为批评家的裴辽士对格林卡的音乐给予极高的评价。
    一八四八年，格林卡写了不朽的“卡玛琳斯卡雅”交响幻想曲。这可以说是俄罗斯交响乐学派发展的开始，这和他以前写的两个歌剧的序曲和以后
  （一八五一年）写的“马德里之夜”一样，指出了俄罗斯交响乐风格的根本方向。柴可夫斯基说“卡玛琳斯卡雅”“奠定了俄罗斯交响乐创作的基石”，说格林卡写的另外几个插曲是：“贝多芬手笔的复兴，每一篇都是一个出自名手的小幅图画，它们都是交响乐的神品。”卡玛琳斯卡雅舞曲是根据一首民间结婚歌和一首舞曲编成的，这篇音乐淋漓尽致地表现了俄罗斯普通人民的生活和性格。
    一八五七年二月十五日，格林卡死于柏林，安葬在彼得堡。
    格林卡的一生遵守着自己对音乐创作的主张：
  “作曲家的创作的基础是人民的音乐，创作音乐的是人民，作曲只是把它编制一下罢了。”虽然他的音乐中直接引用民间的曲调不是很多，他写出很多极富形象性和感染力的独创的曲调，但这些曲调具有着强烈的民族情感和色调。他的音乐的和声完美地结合着那些具有独特性格的曲调，他的管弦法丰富、有力而多采。他的音乐极富戏剧性，但绝无音响效果上的夸张和情感上的造作，而常是首先集中地用完美的极富形象性的曲调来描写思想和感情。
    格林卡的进步的民主主义的思想，使他接近人民，了解生活。他继承了俄罗斯人民艺术的传统，追随着思想上的先驱者们，以最深切的爱，用音乐表现了俄罗斯人民的生活；以深刻的生活知识，用音乐表现了俄罗斯人民的性格。他和他同时代的进步的民主主义者一起，反对俄罗斯封建贵族愚昧人民的统治政策，并将这种信念在自己的音乐创作中体现出来。所以，格林卡给予他的后进们以最大的影响，“强力集团”的作曲家们以“格林卡和人民性”为自己的旗帜，柴可夫斯基对他的音乐给予极高的评价。
    格林卡创作中所表现的人民性和民族性，使当时的伟大作家和批评家们如普希金、果戈理、别林斯基、斯塔索夫，一直到伟大的高尔基都对格林卡的创作道路和创作方法给以肯定的估价，高尔基亲切地称他为“魔术家的格林卡”，他的把民间音乐作为作曲家音乐创作的根本要素和灵感源泉的思想，直到今天仍然有着重大的意义。
    中国的音乐工作者们以十分崇敬的心情纪念这位音乐史上的巨匠，因为在我们正努力继承我们的民族音乐传统，创建、发展我们的新的人民音乐文化的今天，作为音乐上的俄罗斯学派的开拓者和先驱者的格林卡的活动，他的创作思想和他的以高度的艺术性反映了俄罗斯人民的生活和精神的作品，是我们必须学习的典范。中国的音乐学生正贪婪地研究着格林卡的作品，格林卡的歌剧音乐已经成为每个声乐学生和声乐家的节目单中的重要部分。今年，伟大的作曲家诞生一百五十周年，中国的年青的管弦乐队、合唱团和独唱家在我国的首都演出了格林卡的管弦乐作品和声乐作品，这对于我国人民进一步了解这位大师和学习俄罗斯古典音乐的伟大成就，对于进一步加强中苏两国人民之间的文化交流，增强两国人民之间的伟大友谊，将有巨大的作用。（附图片）
