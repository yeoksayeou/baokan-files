    Correctly Conduct Engineering Estimates to Ensure the On-Schedule Commencement of Capital Construction Projects
    Central-South Construction Engineering Bureau Decides to Establish a Joint Budget Office
    In order to correctly conduct engineering estimation work and ensure the on-schedule commencement of capital construction projects, the Central-South Administrative Committee Construction Engineering Bureau has decided to establish a joint budget office for capital construction units in Wuhan, with the Central-South Design Institute as the main body, absorbing construction units such as the Central-South First Engineering Company and various construction departments, to collectively conduct engineering estimation work.
    After studying the general task of the state during the transition period and criticizing the capitalist management ideology of overestimating labor and materials, the staff and workers of various engineering companies in the Central-South region and Wuhan municipality have made some improvements in the estimation work, but a wrong idea has also emerged, namely, that the estimators are afraid of overestimating and miscalculating, which prolongs the estimation time. For example, when the Central-South First Engineering Company recently estimated a certain project, the total cost was only 1.5 billion yuan, but the estimation had not been completed after a month. After the establishment of the joint budget office, the phenomenon of procrastination can be overcome. The units participating in the joint office will be responsible for their respective work, and finally, the design, construction, and construction parties will meet to negotiate, and a construction contract can be signed after a consensus is reached. In addition, the joint budget office will also invite the Bank of Communications to participate, in order to facilitate the state bank's supervision of capital construction appropriations.

    正确进行工程估算保证基本建设工程按期开工
    中南建筑工程局决定成立联合预算办公室
    为正确地进行工程估算工作，保证基本建设工程按期开工，中南行政委员会建筑工程局决定以中南设计院为主，吸收中南第一工程公司等施工单位与各兴建部门参加，成立武汉市基本建设单位联合预算办公室，集体进行工程估算工作。
    中南区及武汉市所属各工程公司职工，学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务，批判了高估工料的资本主义经营思想以后，在估算工作方面有了若干改进，但又产生了一种错误思想，就是估算人员害怕高估和估错，把估算时间拖得很长。如中南第一工程公司最近估算某工程时，总造价只有十五亿元，估算了一个月还未结束。联合预算办公室成立后，就可克服拖延不决的现象。参加联合办公室的单位分工负责进行工作，最后由设计、施工和兴建三方面开会协商，意见一致后即可签订包工合同。此外，联合预算办公室还要邀请交通银行参加，以便于国家银行对基本建设拨款进行监督工作。
