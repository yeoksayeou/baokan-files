Xinhua News Agency, London, June 29th: According to TASS, the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada, held meetings in London from May 13th to June 22nd. On June 24th, the subcommittee issued a brief communique.

The Soviet Union submitted a proposal for consideration by the subcommittee, namely: that all countries should undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

The representative of the United States and representatives of other Western countries refused to accept the Soviet proposal, and they replaced the issue of immediately banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments with discussions on the issue of collecting and reviewing information on the armaments and armed forces of various countries, that is, collecting intelligence materials.

In order to effectively solve the problem of prohibiting all types of weapons of mass destruction and substantially reducing armaments and armed forces, the Soviet representative submitted the Soviet government's proposal to the subcommittee for discussion on June 11th. The Soviet government proposed:

In accordance with the provisions of the Soviet representative's proposal submitted to the subcommittee on June 1st, all countries should undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, as the first important step towards completely eliminating atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction from national armaments, and simultaneously establishing strict international supervision to ensure the implementation of agreements prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war purposes.

The Soviet proposal for an international convention on banning atomic weapons, reducing armaments, and establishing international supervision should include the following basic principles:

A. Unconditional prohibition of the use, manufacture, and stockpiling of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

B. The United States, Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union should reduce all armaments, all ground forces, and naval and air forces by one-third within one year.

Participating countries in the convention are obligated to reduce their military expenditures by at least one-third compared to the expenditures of the 1953-1954 fiscal year within one year.

Participating countries in the convention are obligated not to maintain military, air force, and naval bases on foreign territory, and to abolish existing bases within one year.

C. Establish effective international supervision to supervise the compliance of all countries with the provisions of the convention on prohibiting weapons of mass destruction and reducing armaments and armed forces. International supervision will be established on the following basis:

	1. International supervision should be established over all enterprises engaged in the extraction of atomic materials and the production of atomic materials and atomic energy, as well as over conventional armaments.

	2. In order to implement measures for supervising atomic enterprises and conventional armaments, an international supervisory agency should be established within the framework of the Security Council. The staff of this agency should be selected on an international basis.

	3. The tasks of the international supervisory agency include monitoring enterprises engaged in the extraction of atomic materials and the production of atomic materials and atomic energy; the international supervisory agency will conduct regular monitoring and has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries. The international supervisory agency should supervise the compliance of all countries with their obligations to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces.

	4. In order to perform its duties, the international supervisory agency will monitor the activities of all enterprises engaged in the extraction, processing, and use of atomic materials and atomic energy; collect and summarize materials on the extraction, production, and use of atomic materials and atomic energy; require countries to provide information on armaments and armed forces and review them; and make recommendations to governments and the Security Council on issues related to the production, storage, and use of atomic materials and atomic energy, as well as on issues related to the reduction of armaments and armed forces of various countries.

D. All participating countries in the convention should guarantee the prohibition of propaganda aimed at inciting international hostility and hatred and preparing for another world war.

E. The convention shall enter into force upon ratification by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

Representatives of Western countries refused to accept the Soviet proposal.

    苏联曾提出了一个建议交小组委员会审议，这个建议就是：各国应承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    美国代表和其他西方国家的代表拒绝接受苏联的这个建议，他们用讨论关于收集和审查关于各国的军备和武装力量的情报、即收集情报材料的问题来代替立即禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题。
    为了有效地解决关于禁止各种类型大规模毁灭性武器并大量裁减军备和武装部队的问题，苏联代表在六月十一日把苏联政府的建议提请小组委员会讨论。苏联政府建议：

    参加公约的各国有义务不在外国境内维持军事、空军和海军基地，并在一年内取消现有的基地。
    丙、建立有效的国际监督来监督各国遵守关于禁止大规模毁灭性武器和裁减军备和武装部队的公约的规定。国际监督将在以下基础上建立：
      子、应对所有从事开采原子物资和生产原子
  物资和原子能的企业以及对常规军备建立国际监
  督。
      丑、为了对原子企业以及对常规军备实行监
  督的措施，在安全理事会范围内设立一个国际监
  督机构。这个机构的工作人员应在国际基础上选
  出。
      寅、国际监督机构的任务包括监察从事开采
  原子物资和生产原子物资及原子能的企业；国际
  监督机构经常进行监察，它无权干涉各国内政。
  国际监督机构应监督各国履行裁减常规军备和武
  装部队的义务的情况。
      卯、国际监督机构为了履行它的职务，将监
  督所有从事开采、加工和使用原子物资和原子能
  的企业的活动。收集和总结关于开采、生产和使
  用原子物资和原子能的材料；要求各国提供关于
  军备和武装部队的情报并加以审查；就原子物资
  和原子能的生产、储存和使用问题以及有关裁减
  各国军备和武装部队问题向各国政府以及安全理
  事会提出建议。
    丁、公约的所有参加国应保证禁止旨在煽动国际敌对和仇恨与准备另一次世界大战的宣传。
