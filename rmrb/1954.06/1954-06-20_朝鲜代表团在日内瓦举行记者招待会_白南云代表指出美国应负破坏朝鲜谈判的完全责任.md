Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 18th: Bai Nan-un, a delegate of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea delegation participating in the Geneva Conference, issued a statement at a press conference held at the "Press Building" in Geneva on the evening of the 16th.

At the beginning of the press conference, Bai Nan-un referred to the words spoken by Byun Yung-tai, the representative of the South Korean puppet regime, at a press conference at noon on the 16th. Byun Yung-tai said, "Since the Geneva Conference has suffered a setback, I believe South Korea can take any action to unify Korea and establish a unified, democratic country." Bai Nan-un said, "It is not difficult to understand what Byun Yung-tai meant by 'any action.' Even while the Geneva Conference was in progress, Syngman Rhee was clamoring in Seoul for 'marching north to unify Korea.' Byun Yung-tai's words even more clearly exposed the underlying intentions of the American group in causing setbacks to the Geneva Conference. Byun Yung-tai even said that since the Geneva Conference suffered a setback, the Korean Armistice Agreement seems to have lost its legal effect as well. There is absolutely no reason to believe that the setbacks the American group inflicted on the Geneva Conference would have any impact on the legal effect of the Korean Armistice Agreement."

In the latter part of his statement, Bai Nan-un summarized the entire process of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean issue, as well as the situation in North and South Korea.

Bai Nan-un said that at the beginning of the conference, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, based on the characteristics of the current situation in North and South Korea, put forward specific proposals for the peaceful reunification of Korea. These proposals received the full support of Foreign Minister Molotov and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. However, the United States and certain other countries that follow it and want to maintain colonial privileges in Asia took a different path. They did not want to establish a unified, democratic Korean state; they dreamed of expanding the Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea. It is quite obvious that such a dream is impossible to realize.

Although the American group took this action, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the utmost sincerity, spared no effort to strive for a solution to the Korean issue on an appropriate basis.

Foreign Minister Nam Il fully agreed with Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's suggestion: to establish a neutral organization composed of representatives from neutral countries that did not participate in the Korean War. At the same time, he fully agreed with Foreign Minister Molotov's suggestion that an agreement should be reached on the principled issues on which the participants almost unanimously agreed, and that unresolved issues should be further studied. The American group opposed these suggestions. However, we have not given up hope of resolving the Korean issue.

Bai Nan-un said that on June 15, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and China put forward three suggestions, but Byun Yung-tai, the representative of the Syngman Rhee group, and the protectors of this regime, opposed them without even giving our suggestions serious consideration. As a result, the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference was finally obstructed by the joint declaration of the representatives of the sixteen countries of the American group under the control of the United States.

The United States should bear full responsibility for undermining the discussion of the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference and should be severely judged by peace-loving people all over the world.

Bai Nan-un said that today American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism as the culprit for destroying peace in the East. The United States considers advocating peace a crime and sells war under the guise of morality.

The Syngman Rhee regime demands that American troops continue to stay and rejects the principle that Koreans should solve the Korean issue themselves. The Korean people absolutely do not want American troops to continue to stay, and the continued presence of American troops hinders the independence of Korea. Only Syngman Rhee and his group, who are opposed to the Korean people, want this. The withdrawal of foreign troops should be the first step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Bai Nan-un talked about the situation in South Korea. Bai Nan-un said, "I come from South Korea, and Seoul is my lovely home. I spent forty long years there. Therefore, I am very familiar with the situation in South Korea."

After the U.S. military landed in Incheon on September 8, 1945, the U.S. military government took a series of anti-people and anti-democratic tyrannical measures in South Korea. South Korea under the rule of the U.S. military government and the South Korean provisional government became a completely fascist police state. In education and culture, the U.S. military government also implemented strict fascist policies. Police terror was so rampant that the safety of people's lives was greatly threatened.

Bai Nan-un said, "On a dark night in the spring of 1948, I escaped from Seoul, and two days later I crossed the 38th parallel, thus being able to live in the air of freedom."

Bai Nan-un talked about the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Bai Nan-un said that in March 1946, North Korea implemented land reform, and farmers, who accounted for 80% of the total population, obtained more than one million hectares of land free of charge, thus becoming the owners of their cultivated land. Since August 1946, thanks to the implementation of labor laws, the lives of workers and staff have been fundamentally improved, and the prices of necessities have also been constantly reduced. In education and culture, a democratic education system that benefits the people and develops the country has been implemented. North Korea has become a completely different world from South Korea.

Bai Nan-un talked about the farce of the South Korean "parliamentary elections." Bai Nan-un said that despite the fact that they often re-enact the farce of "parliamentary elections," the task of the Syngman Rhee regime has always been to ensure American military aggression and economic plunder.

The basic purpose of American aid is to turn South Korea into a market for selling American surplus goods, a source of its military raw materials, a dollar investment area, a business place for Wall Street merchants, and a military base. More than 80% of the factories in the area from Seoul to Incheon, which has always been the industrial area of South Korea, have been destroyed and plundered. The production of the cotton textile industry, which has always been South Korea's main industry, has been reduced astonishingly, and cotton production has been reduced to one-third of the pre-liberation level.

Millions of people are unemployed in South Korea, and most farmers are struggling on the verge of starvation. By 1951, more than one million people had starved to death. According to the survey report of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Syngman Rhee regime, in 1953 alone, South Korea lacked 7.17 million seok (volume unit) of rice. Such are the consequences of American economic aid.

Generally speaking, the characteristics of the South Korean economy are: on the one hand, the people's economy is completely bankrupt, and on the other hand, the monopoly capital economy enjoys privileges and makes huge profits; the characteristics of the political aspect are: the people have no freedom and rights, and fascist dictatorship is constantly strengthened; the characteristics of the social and cultural aspects are: the phenomena of decadence, corruption, and extravagance are increasing day by day; the characteristics of the military and police aspects are: the atrocities of aggression and plunder are increasingly rampant.

In order to preserve and expand these poisonous legacies of American policies, the Syngman Rhee government carried out large-scale military adventures. The war of marching north launched in June 1950 was actually such a military adventure.

Bai Nan-un said that the armistice in Korea was to lead to the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the task at the Geneva Conference should also have been to formulate measures for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The Korean people are a single nation with a long history. Therefore, the military demarcation line splitting Korea into two parts has brought the greatest misfortune to the Korean people. Any argument that defends the permanent maintenance of this state of division of the Korean people is untenable. If the Syngman Rhee regime does not learn from the lessons of the Korean War and still dreams of "marching north to unify Korea," then he will get nothing but a repetition of his traitorous crimes. The only way to restore the inherent unity of the Korean people that has been destroyed is the peaceful reunification of Korea.

At the Geneva Conference, the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea worked hard to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and dealt with the representatives of the Syngman Rhee government with the greatest patience and tolerance. However, in the end, it was proved that the only obstacle on the road to the peaceful reunification and independence of Korea is the American warmongers.

    朝鲜代表团在日内瓦举行记者招待会
    白南云代表指出美国应负破坏朝鲜谈判的完全责任
    【新华社日内瓦十八日电】参加日内瓦会议的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团代表白南云十六日晚在日内瓦“新闻大厦”举行的记者招待会上发表了一篇声明。
    记者招待会开始时，白南云提到南朝鲜傀儡政权代表卞荣泰在十六日中午在一个记者招待会上所说的话，卞荣泰说，“由于日内瓦会议已经受到挫折，我认为南朝鲜可以采取任何行动来统一朝鲜，并建立一个统一的、民主的国家。”白南云说，“不难了解卞荣泰所说的‘任何行动’所指的是什么。甚至在日内瓦会议正在进行时，李承晚就在汉城叫嚣‘北进统一朝鲜’。卞荣泰的话更清楚地暴露了使日内瓦会议受到挫折的美国集团底目的。卞荣泰甚至说，由于日内瓦会议受到挫折，朝鲜停战协定似乎也丧失了法律效力了。认为美国集团使日内瓦会议受到的挫折会对朝鲜停战协定的法律效力发生任何影响，这是完全没有理由的。”
    白南云在他的声明的后一部分概括地叙述了日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的整个过程，以及南北朝鲜的情况。
    白南云说，在会议开始的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团就根据南北朝鲜目前情况的特点，提出了和平统一朝鲜的具体建议。这些建议得到莫洛托夫外长和周恩来外长的全力支持。但是美国和追随它的、想在亚洲保持殖民地特权的某些其他国家的代表们走了不同的道路。他们不想建立一个统一、民主的朝鲜国家，他们梦想把李承晚政权扩大到北朝鲜去。十分明显，这种梦想是不可能实现的。
    虽然美国集团采取了这种行动，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团还是本着最大的诚意，不遗余力地争取在适当的基础上解决朝鲜问题。
    南日外务相完全同意周恩来外长的建议：成立由没有参加朝鲜战争的中立国的代表组成的中立机构。他同时完全同意莫洛托夫外长的建议，即应该在与会者差不多一致同意的原则问题上达成协议，未解决的问题应进一步研究。美国集团反对这些建议。但是，我们并没有放弃解决朝鲜问题的希望。
    白南云说，在六月十五日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，苏联和中国代表团提出了三个建议，但是李承晚集团的代表卞荣泰和这个政权的保护者甚至对我们的建议没有加以认真的研究便反对它们。这样一来，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，终于被美国操纵下的美国集团十六个国家的代表的共同宣言所阻挠了。
    美国应该为破坏日内瓦会议的朝鲜问题的讨论负完全责任，应该受到全世界爱好和平的人民的严厉裁判。
    白南云说，今天美国帝国主义已经代替了日本帝国主义的地位，成为破坏东方和平的罪魁。美国认为主张和平就是罪行，并在道义的幌子下贩卖战争。
    李承晚政权要求美国军队继续留下来，并拒绝由朝鲜人自己来解决朝鲜问题的原则。朝鲜人民绝不愿意美国军队继续留驻，美军继续留驻是妨碍朝鲜的独立的。只有和朝鲜人民作对的李承晚和他的集团愿意这样。撤退外国军队应该是和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步。
    白南云谈到南朝鲜的情况。白南云说，我从南朝鲜来，汉城是我可爱的家，我在那里过了四十个漫长的年头。因此，南朝鲜的情况我是非常熟悉的。
    一九四五年九月八日美军在仁川登陆后，美军政府在南朝鲜采取了一系列反人民反民主的横暴措施。在当时的美军政府和南朝鲜临时政府统治下的南朝鲜变成了一个彻头彻尾的法西斯警察国家。在教育和文化方面，美军政府也实行严厉的法西斯政策。警察恐怖是如此猖獗，以致人民生命的安全受到很大的威胁。
    白南云说，一九四八年春季的一个黑夜，我从汉城逃出来，两天以后我越过了三八线，从而能够生活在自由的空气中。
    白南云谈到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的情况。白南云说，一九四六年三月，北朝鲜实行土地改革，占全部人口百分之八十的农民无偿地得到了一百多万公顷的土地，这样他们就变成了他们的耕地的主人。一九四六年八月以来，由于实行了劳动法令，工人和机关工作人员的生活已有了根本的改善，生活必需品的价格也在不断减低。在教育和文化方面，实行了造福人民和发展国家的民主教育制度。北朝鲜变成了一个和南朝鲜完全不同的世界。
    白南云谈到了南朝鲜“国会选举”的丑剧。白南云说，尽管他们常常重演“国会选举”的丑剧，李承晚政权的任务事实上始终是保证美国进行军事侵略和经济掠夺。
    美国援助的基本目的是把南朝鲜变为推销美国剩余商品的市场，变成它的军事原料的来源、美元投资地区、华尔街商人的营业场所和军事基地。向来为南朝鲜工业区的从汉城到仁川地区的工厂有百分之八十以上遭到了摧毁和掠夺。向来是南朝鲜的主要工业的棉纺织工业的产量已惊人地减少了，棉产量已减为解放前水平的三分之一。
    南朝鲜有几百万人失业，并且大部分农民都是在饥饿的边缘上挣扎，到一九五一年，有一百余万人饿死。根据李承晚政权农林部的调查报告，单是在一九五三年，南朝鲜就缺少七百一十七万石（桶量）大米。美国经济援助的后果就是如此。
  整个说来，南朝鲜经济方面的特点是：一方面是人民的经济完全陷于破产，另一方面是垄断资本经济享有特权，大发横财；政治方面的特点是：人民没有自由和权利，而法西斯独裁不断加强；社会和文化方面的特点是：堕落、腐化、奢华的现象与日俱增；在军事和警察方面的特点是：侵占和掠夺的暴行日益猖獗。
    为了保存和扩大这些美国政策的遗毒，李承晚政府实行了大规模的军事冒险，一九五○年六月发动的北进战争，实际上就是这样一种军事冒险。
    白南云说，朝鲜的停战是为了导致朝鲜的和平统一，日内瓦会议上的任务本来也应当是制订和平解决朝鲜问题的措施。
    朝鲜人是一个历史悠久的单一的民族。因此，军事分界线把朝鲜分裂成两部分给朝鲜人民带来了最大的不幸。任何为永远保持朝鲜人民的这种分裂状态辩护的论调都是站不住脚的。如果李承晚政权不吸取朝鲜战争的教训，仍然梦想“北进统一朝鲜”的话，那么他除了重复他的卖国罪行之外，得不到任何东西。恢复已遭破坏的朝鲜人民的固有的统一的唯一道路，就是和平统一朝鲜。
    在日内瓦会议上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团努力谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，曾以最大的耐心和容忍来和李承晚政府的代表打交道。但是，最后终于证明，在朝鲜的和平统一和独立的道路上的唯一障碍，是美国战争贩子。
