Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th: Guangxi Province has begun to systematically divide fishery and forestry management areas. It has now been determined that in the Beibu Gulf coastal area, a zone stretching over 1,000 *li* from Dadu Port in Hepu County to Luofu in Fangcheng County, six administrative districts and four directly subordinate townships will be designated as key fishery management areas. Within the Dayaoshan Yao Autonomous Region, the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous Region in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, and over twenty counties including Fusui and Huanjiang, as well as several districts and townships, seven forestry management areas will be designated, primarily to develop timber forests of Chinese fir, eucalyptus, and pine. In the future, these fishery and forestry management areas will focus their work on fishery production and forestry production respectively, in order to better support national industrial construction.

The division of fishery and forestry management areas in Guangxi Province is being carried out on the basis of increased grain production. In 1952, the province's total grain output exceeded the average annual output from 1931 to 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan by more than 21%. In 1953, the province's total grain output continued to increase, not only achieving self-sufficiency but also having a large surplus to support national construction. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry began to investigate the relevant situation of fishery and forestry production, collect reliable data, and divide management areas.

    广西省有计划地划分渔业和林业经营区域
    【新华社南宁四日电】广西省开始有计划地划分渔业和林业经营区域。现已确定在东京湾海滨，从合浦县对达港到防城县罗浮一千多里长的地带，划分六个行政区和四个直属乡为重点渔业经营区；在大瑶山瑶族自治区、桂西僮族自治区内的大苗山苗族自治区、三江县侗族自治区和扶绥、环江等二十多个县以及若干区、乡，划分七个林业经营区，以发展杉、桉、松等用材林为主。今后这些渔业和林业经营区域将分别以渔业生产和林业生产为各项工作的中心，以便更好地支援国家工业建设。
    广西省开始划分渔业和林业经营区域，是在粮食增产的基础上进行的。一九五二年全省粮食产量超过抗日战争前一九三一年到一九三六年的平均年产量百分之二十一以上。一九五三年全省粮食产量继续提高，不但能够自给，并有大批余粮支援国家建设。因此，今年年初中共广西省委员会农村工作部和广西省人民政府农林厅就着手调查渔业和林业生产的有关情况，收集可靠资料，划分经营区域。
