Dear Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Kim Ung-gi, esteemed delegates, and comrades of the art troupe:

Today, the people of all circles in our capital are here with infinite warmth and reluctance to bid farewell to the Korean People's Delegation to China as they depart Beijing to return to Korea. On behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the China People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association, and all the Chinese people, allow me to extend a warm send-off to all comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by Head Kim Ung-gi, and once again extend to all comrades of the delegation, and through you, to the Korean people, our brotherly and lofty respect.

During its visit to our country for more than three months, the Korean People's Delegation to China tirelessly conducted extensive visits throughout our country, delivering numerous reports on the situation in Korea to the broad masses of our people. The art troupe also gave one hundred and twenty-nine brilliant performances, allowing the broad masses of our people to more deeply appreciate the lofty patriotism and internationalism displayed by the heroic Korean people in their just war against American aggression, and to further recognize the tremendous struggle the Korean people are undertaking, with the same indomitable heroism they showed in defeating the aggressors, to heal the wounds of war and rebuild their country. It also allowed us to recognize the glorious achievements of the Korean people in inheriting and developing their excellent cultural and artistic traditions, thereby powerfully encouraging the enthusiasm of our people to strive for the realization of the beautiful aspiration of building socialism, encouraging the enthusiasm of our people to further support, with practical actions, the cause of the Korean brotherly nation in striving for national reunification and rebuilding a peaceful life, and further consolidating the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the people of the whole country to all comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China and to the Korean people.

As we bid farewell to the Korean People's Delegation to China here, please allow me to sincerely ask Head Kim Ung-gi and all comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China to convey to all the Korean people the infinite respect and gratitude of the Chinese people to the heroic Korean people, and the determination of all our people to continue to support the great cause of the Korean people in striving for national reunification and rebuilding a peaceful life. Please tell the Korean people that the Chinese people will, together with the Korean people, together with the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and together with all peace-loving people in the world, continue to struggle for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The firm unity of the Chinese and Korean people, the firm unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, is a reliable guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. Consolidating and developing this unity is our common sacred task. Finally, let us shout:

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the powerful unity of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the wise leader of the Korean people!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live peace in the Far East and the world!
