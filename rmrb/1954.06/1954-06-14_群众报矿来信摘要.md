    Excerpts from Letters from the Masses Reporting Mineral Deposits
    One, Dear geological work comrades:
    I am a soldier guarding the frontier of the motherland in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Whenever I pass through fertile fields and over rolling hills, I always feel that every inch of the great motherland is very lovable, and I wonder: are there any rich treasures here that have not yet been discovered? Our motherland is so vast and extensive that it is impossible for geological work comrades and drilling work comrades to travel to every corner of the motherland. I feel it is my responsibility to help you discover the treasures of the motherland.
    One day, I went to a village five or six miles away from the garrison. As I passed the rice fields, I found a layer of something floating on the surface of the water in the rice fields, reflecting colorful light in the sunlight, just like gasoline leaking from a car and dripping into a puddle on the road. At that time, I felt very strange, could there be oil buried here? After returning to the garrison, I searched all our magazines and books, read two articles about oil, and learned some methods of identifying oil. I went to the place I thought might have oil seepages to conduct experiments, and found several large patches of brownish-yellow mud on the edge of the field, with that kind of colored oily substance floating on it. These things were also gushing out of some small holes above (this area is all sandy soil). A few days later, after a heavy rain, I passed by there again. The large patches of brownish-yellow mud had been washed away by the rain, and the things gushing out of the edge of the field were even clearer. I also heard that places producing oil often have a kind of white soil, which made me think that when our troops were carrying out the patriotic health campaign, many units dug a lot of white soil near the garrison by the small river. When I got this news, I didn't even take a nap, and rushed to the place where the white soil was dug by the river, and found that many colored oily substances were also gushing out, and some even gushed out from the gaps in the white soil. I believe even more that this oily substance may be precious oil.
    I couldn't find a laboratory, and I couldn't get an answer to this question. Whenever I passed this place and saw that colored oily substance, I felt uncomfortable in my heart. Those colored oily substances seemed to be saying to me:
  “Since you have discovered this situation, why don't you hurry up and find a way to figure it out!” Therefore, I am writing this letter to you today for your reference. And I hope you will give me a reply immediately, tell me your opinions, or tell me more about how to confirm oil.

    Two, Comrade Minister of the Central Geological Department:
    I am a first-year student at the Central China Institute of Technology. Since Chairman Mao put forward the general task of the state's transition period, I have become more enthusiastic about the socialist construction of the motherland. Some time ago, I saw some news in the newspapers about geological exploration and mass reporting of mineral deposits, and I thought of two kinds of mineral deposits that I knew about, so I wrote a letter to tell you.
    The first type is what I saw when I was a child herding cattle in my hometown. This mineral deposit is square and has no luster. It is not as shiny as the native copper on mineral radios. I still don't know what kind of mineral it is. There is also a hexagonal columnar crystal there. When we were young, we often picked them up and took them home. The adults said that these crystals could cut glass; but when we tried to cut glass, it was very difficult to cut. Regarding the above-mentioned mineral deposit, I remember that when I was herding cattle, I picked up some and put them at home, but I forgot where I put them. I have already written to my mother, asking her to find it, and if she can't find it, to pick up some more and send it to me, and then I will forward it to you for testing.
    The second type is phosphate rock, which I discovered when I was studying in Guilin two years ago. The location of the phosphate rock is in a large bay of the Guilin Guijiang River (also called the Lijiang River), and the quantity is quite large. It is like chalk, appearing in small sections. When we go swimming in this bay, we can find a lot, and sometimes we bring some back to school. Later, the teacher told us that this is phosphate rock, which is very toxic and should not be played with casually. I think: phosphorus is very useful in our industrial construction, so I also tell you about this mineral deposit.
    Regarding these two types of mineral deposits, please pass them on to the comrades in the geological exploration work, and ask them to conduct on-site exploration. If the reserves are abundant, then they will become treasures for the construction of the motherland. I have drawn two maps and sent them to you. The comrades in the geological exploration work can easily find the location of the mineral deposits with these two maps.

    群众报矿来信摘要
    一亲爱的地质工作同志们：
    我是守卫在祖国边疆的中国人民解放军中的一个战士。每当我穿过肥沃的田野，越过起伏的丘陵时，总感到伟大祖国的每一寸土地都非常可爱，并且猜想着：在这里有没有丰富的宝藏还没有被发现呢！我们的祖国如此辽阔广大，地质工作同志们，钻探工作同志们是不可能走遍祖国的每一个角落的，我认为自己有责任帮助你们发现祖国的宝藏。
    有一天，我到离驻地五六里外的一个村子里去。在我经过的稻田边，发现有一层东西浮在稻田的水面上，在日光下反射着五颜六色的光彩，就像从汽车里漏下的汽油滴在公路上的水洼里一样。当时我感到很奇怪，莫非这里埋藏着石油？回到驻地后，我找遍了我们所有的杂志书籍，读到两篇有关石油的文章，了解了一些识别石油的方法，我又去到认为可能是石油油苗的地方进行试验，并在田边上找到几大滩黄褐色的稀泥，上面浮着那种彩色油质的东西，这些东西又是从上面一些小洞里涌出来的（这一带都是沙土）。过了几天，正在下了大雨之后，我又经过那里，大滩大滩黄褐色的稀泥都被雨水冲走了，那从田边上涌出来的东西看得更清楚了。我又听说出产石油的地方常有一种白土，这使我想到，我们部队在开展爱国卫生运动时，很多单位就在驻地附近的小河边挖了许多白土。我得到这个消息，连午觉也不睡，就赶到河边挖白土的地方，发现也有许多彩色油质涌出来，甚至有的是从白土的空隙中涌出来的。我更认为这种油质可能是宝贵的石油。
    我没法找到化验所，没法得到这个问题的答案，每当我经过这个地方，看到那种彩色油质时，心里总感到难受。那些彩色油质仿佛在对我说：
  “你既然发现了这种情况，为什么不赶快想办法弄清楚呢！”所以，我今天写了这封信寄给你们，供你们参考。并希望你们立即给我一封回信，告诉我你们的意见，或者再告诉我一些关于证实石油的方法。
    罗中宪
    二中央地质部部长同志：
    我是华中工学院一年级的学生。自从毛主席提出国家过渡时期总任务后，我对祖国的社会主义建设更加热爱了。前些时候，我在报纸上看到一些关于地质勘探和群众报矿的消息，联想起我所知道的两种矿藏，特写信来告诉您。
    第一种是我幼年时代在家乡放牛时所见到的，这种矿藏是方形的，没有光泽，它没有矿石收音机上的自然铜光亮，到现在我还不知道它是什么矿。在那里，还有一种六角柱水晶，小时候我们常捡了拿回家去，大人们说这些水晶可以割玻璃；但是拿玻璃来试割时，却很难割。上面所说的矿藏，我还记得放牛时曾经捡了一些放在家里，但是忘记把它放在什么地方了。我已经给母亲写了信，要她找到，如果找不到也要她再去捡一些寄给我，然后再转寄给您们进行化验。
    第二种是磷矿，这是我前年在桂林读书时发现的。磷矿的地点是在桂林桂江（也叫漓江）的一个大江湾里，数量相当多，它像粉笔一样，一小节一小节出现。我们到这个江湾游泳时，都能找到很多，有时还装一些带回校中来。后来老师才告诉我们这是磷矿，毒性很大，不许随便玩弄。我想：磷在我们的工业建设上是很有用的，所以我也把这种矿藏告诉您。
    关于这两种矿藏，请您转告给地质勘探工作的同志们，请他们实地勘探，如果藏量丰富，那就成了祖国建设的宝贝了。我画了两张地图寄给您，地质勘探工作同志们凭这两张地图，就很容易找到矿藏的所在地了。
