    Wuhan Holds First Party Congress
    Defines This Year's Tasks, Elects New Municipal Committee
   [Our Wuhan Dispatch, June 2] The Chinese Communist Party's Wuhan Municipal organization held its first representative congress from May 24 to June 1. The central topics of the meeting were to summarize and review the work of the Wuhan Municipal Committee in 1953, based on the Party's general line for the transition period and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session; to define the tasks for 1954; and to elect the Wuhan Municipal Committee.
    At the meeting, Wang Renzhong, the former First Secretary of the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the Municipal Committee, and Zhang Pinghua, the Second Secretary, delivered a report entitled "Unite Closely and Strive to Build Wuhan into a New Socialist Industrial City," proposing the future work tasks for Wuhan, which were submitted to the congress for deliberation.
    The congress reviewed and fully discussed these two reports. It unanimously agreed that the work of the former Wuhan Municipal Committee was successful and in line with the general line, and that the leadership of the Municipal Committee was basically united, thus enabling it to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people of the city to successfully complete the work of restoring and developing the economy, and to overfulfill the first annual plan of the national five-year construction plan. The meeting criticized the Municipal Committee's past shortcomings in implementing certain specific policies of the central government, pointed out the inadequacy of the Municipal Committee's political and ideological leadership and organizational leadership, and put forward suggestions. It sharply criticized the bureaucratic and red-tape style of some departments of the Municipal Committee, as well as the shortcomings and errors of individual members of the Municipal Committee, and put forward suggestions for improving work. The delegation of the Bureau of Construction Engineering and the Bureau of Construction pointed out the departmentalism of some departments in not sending good cadres to support basic construction when implementing the policy of giving priority to basic construction last year; the delegation of the machinery factory and the textile factory pointed out the slow pace of the Municipal Committee in implementing the central government's instructions on strengthening planned management in the second quarter of last year; and the suburban delegation pointed out that after the land reform in the suburbs, the Municipal Committee's leadership was not timely, and it failed to clarify the direction of mutual aid and cooperation for a long time. These shortcomings have brought losses to the work.
    The meeting clearly pointed out that with the development of the national socialist industrialization, Wuhan will gradually be built into a new socialist industrial city of our country. In the face of this great, glorious, and arduous task, the central task of the Wuhan Municipal Party organization and the people of the city is to organize forces from all sides, actively support these key construction projects, and ensure that these construction projects are completed victoriously according to the national plan. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, handicrafts, and suburban agriculture. The Party's political work, organizational work, and other aspects of work in the city must take this as the center, resolutely and closely serve this center, and at the same time rely on the development of the central work to promote all aspects of work.
    The meeting believed that the basic key and guarantee for completing the above tasks lies in promoting inner-Party democracy and strengthening Party unity, so as to further enhance the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the whole Party and the people of the city for the national construction cause. The meeting pointed out that some cadres in the Wuhan Municipal Party organization are still developing extremely dangerous pride, therefore, every Party member must be vigilant, must improve their Marxist-Leninist level, strengthen Party spirit training, and oppose decentralism, individualism, and pride. All the delegates unanimously expressed that they would unite around the Party Central Committee, strictly abide by the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity," improve the Party's political life, promote inner-Party democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, consolidate Party discipline, and strengthen the Party's collective leadership.
    The meeting, after full deliberation and discussion by all the delegates, determined the list of candidates for members of the Municipal Committee. After a secret ballot, Zhang Pinghua, Song Kanfu, Li Erzhong, Zhao Min, Song Yiping and thirty-one others were elected as members of the CPC Wuhan Municipal Committee, and Luo Yourong and thirteen others were elected as alternate members, which are being submitted to the Central Committee for approval.
    The meeting also approved the work report of the Municipal Committee, and passed the resolution on the work tasks for 1954 and the "Resolution on Implementing the 'Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity' of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party."
    During the meeting, dozens of the Party's grassroots organizations, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, the broad masses of workers and staff, and people's organizations in the city wrote letters to the congress to congratulate it, expressing their support for the congress, and expressing their determination to resolutely struggle to implement the resolutions of the congress under the leadership of the Party.

    武汉市举行第一次党代表大会
    确定今年的工作任务选出新的市委员会
   【本报武汉二日电】中国共产党武汉市党组织，在五月二十四日至六月一日，举行了第一次代表大会。会议的中心议题是根据党在过渡时期的总路线和四中全会的精神，总结和检查武汉市委一九五三年的工作，确定一九五四年任务和选举武汉市委员会。
    会议上，前中共武汉市委第一书记王任重代表市委向大会作了工作报告，第二书记张平化代表市委作了题为“紧密团结起来，为把武汉市建设成为新的社会主义的工业城市而斗争”的报告，提出了武汉市今后的工作任务，交由大会审议。
    大会对这两个报告进行了审查和充分的讨论。一致认为前武汉市委的工作是有成绩的，是符合总路线的，市委的领导基本上是团结的，因而能领导全市工人阶级和广大人民群众胜利完成了恢复发展经济的工作，并超额完成了国家五年建设计划第一年度计划。会议批评了市委过去在执行中央某些具体政策上的缺点，对市委的政治思想领导和组织领导不够，提出了意见，对市委某些部门的官僚主义、文牍主义的作风以及个别市委委员的缺点和错误，进行了尖锐的批评，并提出了改进工作的建议。建筑工程局、建设局代表团指出了去年在贯彻基本建设第一的方针时，有些部门不把好干部去支援基本建设的本位主义思想；机械工厂和纺织工厂代表团指出市委去年第二季度在执行中央关于加强计划管理的指示时的迟缓现象；郊区代表团指出郊区在土地改革结束后，由于市委领导不及时，长期未能明确互助合作的方针。这些缺点都给工作带来了损失。
    会议明确指出：随着国家社会主义工业化事业的发展，武汉市将逐渐建设成为我国新的社会主义的工业城市。在这个伟大光荣而又艰巨的任务面前，武汉市党组织和全市人民的中心任务，就是组织各方面的力量，积极支援这些重点建设，保证这些建设按国家计划胜利完成。同时要加强对资本主义工商业、手工业和郊区农业的社会主义改造。党的政治工作、组织工作以及全市其他各方面的工作都必须以此作为中心，坚决地紧密地为这一中心服务，同时又依靠中心工作的发展来推动各方面的工作。
    会议认为完成上述任务的基本关键和保证，在于发扬党内民主，加强党的团结，以进一步发挥全党和全市人民对国家建设事业的积极性和责任心。会议指出武汉市党组织内某些干部还滋长着极端危险的骄傲情绪，因此，每一个党员都必须引起警惕，必须提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，加强党性锻炼，反对分散主义、个人主义和骄傲情绪。全体代表一致表示要团结在党中央的周围，严格遵守党中央“关于增强党的团结的决议”，健全党的政治生活，发扬党内民主，开展批评和自我批评，巩固党的纪律，加强党的集体领导。
    会议在全体代表充分酝酿、讨论下，确定了市委委员候选人名单。经过无记名选举投票结果，选出张平化、宋侃夫、李尔重、赵敏、宋一平等三十一人为中共武汉市委员会委员，罗有荣等十三人为候补委员，正呈报中央批准。
    会议并批准了市委的工作报告，通过了关于一九五四年的工作任务的决议和“关于贯彻执行党的七届四中全会‘关于增强党的团结的决议’的决议”。
    会议期间，全市数十个党的基层组织、共产党员、青年团员和广大职工群众和人民团体，纷纷向大会写信祝贺，表示支持大会，并在党的领导下，坚决为贯彻大会的决议而奋斗。
