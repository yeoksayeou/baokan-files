Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 1st: Sichuan Province plans to build and expand 52 prefecture and county-level factories and mines this year. These factories are scattered throughout the province, mainly utilizing local raw materials and selling finished products locally, to supplement the inadequacies of provincial-level industries. After the planned construction of a new iron plant, the restoration of eight iron plants, and the reconstruction of eleven iron plants at the prefecture and county levels this year are completed, the iron produced by Sichuan province's prefecture and county-level iron plants will increase by one-third to two-thirds compared to last year. This year, prefecture and county iron plants plan to supply 32,200 tons of iron to rural supply and marketing cooperatives. This batch of iron will be mainly used to manufacture agricultural tools such as hoes, plows, and plowshares, as well as pots for farmers' needs. This year, the prefectures and counties will also restore one coal mine and renovate nineteen coal mines. The renovated coal mines will be equipped with ventilators and expanded tunnels to ensure safe production and increase output. One-third of the coal produced by prefectures and counties this year will be supplied to the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company's Sichuan branch, and two-thirds will be sold locally. After the increase in iron and coal production in the prefectures and counties, the high-quality iron and coal produced by provincial-level and higher local industries can fully support the Southwest state-owned iron and steel industry, as it will be able to meet the needs of local people. Another focus of industrial construction in the prefectures and counties this year is bone meal factories. Sichuan Province is rich in domestic pigs, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region is rich in horses, cattle, and sheep, but most of the bones are discarded. In 1953, the utilization rate of pig, cattle, and sheep bones in the province only reached 20%; on the other hand, farmers needed a large amount of bone meal fertilizer. In order to meet this demand of farmers, seven new bone meal factories will be built in places such as Hechuan County and Shuajin Temple in the Tibetan Autonomous Region this year, and three bone meal factories will be renovated in Nanchong and other places. In this way, the output of bone meal this year will increase by more than 70% compared to last year. In addition, small hydropower plants and refractory material plants will be built this year to further develop local industries to meet the people's demands.
    Industries directly led by prefectures and counties in Sichuan Province account for a large proportion of local industries in Sichuan. In 1953, the total industrial output value of prefectures and counties in the province was 23% higher than that of local industries directly led by the province. They played a significant role in meeting the needs of local people and serving state-owned industries.

    四川省今年计划发展专区和县属地方工业
    【新华社成都一日电】四川省今年将新建、扩建五十二座专区和县所属厂矿。这些工厂散布各地，主要是利用当地原料，并就地销出成品，以辅助省属工业的不足。今年计划在专区和县新建的一个铁厂，恢复的八个铁厂，改建的十一个铁厂完工后，四川省专区和县所属铁厂生产的铁，就要比去年增加三分之一到三分之二。今年专区、县铁厂计划供应农村供销合作社三万二千二百吨铁。这批铁将主要用来制造农民需要的锄头、犁、铧等农具和饭锅等。今年专区、县还要恢复一个煤矿、改建十九个煤矿。改建的煤矿要添置送风机和扩大坑道等，以保证安全生产并提高产量。今年专区、县所产的煤，将以三分之一供应中国煤业建筑器材公司四川省公司，三分之二就地销售。专区、县的铁和煤增产后，由于能够满足当地人民的需要，就可使省属以上地方工业所产的优质的铁和煤等产品，全力支援西南国营钢铁工业。今年专区和县工业建设的另一重点是骨粉厂。四川盛产毛猪，藏族自治区又盛产马、牛、羊等，但骨头大多被丢弃。一九五三年全省猪、牛、羊的骨头利用率只达到百分之二十；而另一方面，农民又大量需用骨粉肥料。为了满足农民这种需求，今年将在合川县和藏族自治区刷金寺等地新建七个骨粉厂，改建南充等地三个骨粉厂。这样，今年骨粉的产量将比去年增加百分之七十以上。此外，今年还将修建小型水电厂和耐火材料厂，以便进一步发展地方工业来满足人民要求。
    四川省专区和县直接领导的工业，在四川地方工业中占很大比重。一九五三年全省专区、县工业的生产总值，比省直接领导的地方工业的生产总值多百分之二十三，它们在满足当地人民需要及为国营工业服务等方面，起了很大作用。
