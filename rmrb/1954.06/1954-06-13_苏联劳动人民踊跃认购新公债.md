Workers at the Moscow Transformer Factory also held a warm gathering to subscribe to the bonds. Turner Semenov decided to use all of his two weeks' wages to buy bonds. He proudly said that in the United States, huge amounts of funds are used to expand armaments and prepare for new wars, while our budget and bonds are used for peaceful construction and improving people's lives. The workers in the assembly workshop of the Moscow Light Bulb Factory completed half a year's production plan ahead of schedule in May. In addition to enthusiastically subscribing to the bonds, they also decided that each worker should complete one and a half to two work quotas in each work shift in the future. The factory's signs indicate that workers are exceeding their targets every hour. In Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, the workers of the "Bolshevik" machine factory decided to complete the first half-year's production plan ahead of schedule in order to support the government's order to issue new government bonds. The news of the issuance of new government bonds also encouraged the people building the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station.

Collective farmers, government cadres, scientific workers, and housewives in various parts of the Soviet Union have also decided to purchase new government bonds with their labor income and savings. The members of the Ilich Collective Farm in the Lenin District near Moscow heard the news of the government's issuance of new government bonds after finishing their field labor that day, and immediately gathered to subscribe to the bonds. Production team leader Yareferova signed first, and then the villagers signed their names one by one. They believe that subscribing to new government bonds is equivalent to voting for a better present and a happier communist future. The news of the issuance of new government bonds reached the children's sanatoriums and summer camps in various parts of the Georgian Republic, where all doctors and staff regarded subscribing to the new bonds as a glorious thing. Dr. Ye Jizhalashvili of the Republic Children's Hospital said that every time a new bond is issued, it means that countless new houses, factories, power stations, hospitals, and sanatoriums will be built.

    【新华社莫斯科十二日电】苏联全体劳动人民热烈拥护苏联部长会议关于发行一九五四年发展苏联国民经济公债的命令，积极认购新公债。
    苏联各地工人在认购新公债的热潮中，表现了高涨的劳动和政治热情。在莫斯科，各工业企业的工人在听到发行新公债的消息后，当天就纷纷举行集会，踊跃认购公债。在“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂第一平炉车间工人认购公债的集会上，著名的炼钢工人奥夫钦尼科夫说，让我们认购的新公债也像我们所炼的钢铁一样，使我们苏维埃国家进一步向前发展和更加繁荣。莫斯科变压器工厂的工人也举行了热烈的认购公债的集会。车工谢麦诺夫决定拿自己两星期的全部工资购买公债。他自毫地说，在美国，庞大的资金用来扩张军备和准备新的战争，而我们的预算和公债都是用来进行和平建设和改善人民生活的。莫斯科电灯泡制造厂装配车间的工人在五月份提前完成了半年的生产计划。他们除踊跃认购了公债外，还决定今后每个工人在每个工作班内都要完成一个半到两个工作定额。工厂的指示牌表示，工人们每一小时都在超额完成任务。在乌克兰共和国首都基辅，“布尔什维克”机器制造厂的工人为了拥护政府发行新公债的命令，决定要提前完成前半年的生产计划。发行新公债的消息也鼓舞了建设古比雪夫水电站的人们，在很短的时间内，工地上的工人、职员和技术人员都认购了公债。
    苏联各地集体农民、机关干部、科学工作者和家庭主妇也决定以自己的劳动收入和积蓄购买新公债。莫斯科附近列宁区伊里奇集体农庄的庄员们，这一天在完毕了田间劳动后听到了政府发行新公债的消息，立即聚集起来认购公债。生产组长亚列费罗娃首先签名，接着庄员们一个一个签上了自己的名字。他们认为，认购新公债，就等于投票拥护美好的现在和更加幸福的共产主义的未来。发行新公债的消息传到了格鲁吉亚共和国各地的儿童疗养院和夏令营，这儿的所有医生和工作人员都把认购新的公债当作光荣的事情。共和国儿童医院的医生叶季加拉什维利说，每发行一次新的公债，这就意味着无数新的住宅、工厂、电力站、医院和疗养院将要建立起来。
