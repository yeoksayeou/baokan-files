    Do not give glass marbles and glass horns to children as toys
    (I)
    Reader Liu Yu's letter: It is very common for children to use glass marbles as toys. In the streets and alleys of various places, it is often possible to see children in groups of three or five crawling on the ground and playing with glass marbles. I think that using glass marbles as toys for children not only has no beneficial effect on their physical strength and intelligence, but also poses a danger to their lives. For example, in the former Zhangli County of Shandong Province, an unfortunate incident occurred where a farmer, Li Hongze's child, swallowed a glass marble into his trachea and died. In order to protect children's health and prevent possible dangerous incidents in this regard, I believe that primary school teachers and children's parents in various places should pay attention to educating and guiding children to engage in other beneficial recreational activities, and should not buy glass marbles for children to play with. The industrial and commercial administrative departments of local people's governments should, based on the specific situation, mobilize manufacturers who produce glass marbles to stop manufacturing and selling them, or mobilize them to convert to other toys that are beneficial to children.
   (II)
    Readers Zhou Shuming, Zhou Jingyu, etc., wrote: We often see vendors selling glass horns for children in some cities. These horns are shaped like half a gourd, with a flat bottom and a long, thin tube. If you hold it in your mouth and inhale and exhale, it will make a "guda" "guda" sound. We believe that this kind of glass horn is not suitable for children to play with. I once saw a child playing with this kind of glass horn, and because he used a little too much force, he actually broke the bottom of the horn, sucking the glass shards into his mouth, almost swallowing them into his throat. For this reason, it is recommended that the industrial and commercial administrative departments of local governments stop private manufacturers from producing and selling similar toys that are harmful to children.

### 不要把玻璃球和玻璃喇叭给儿童作玩具

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不要把玻璃球和玻璃喇叭给儿童作玩具
    （一）
    读者刘毓来信：儿童用玻璃球作玩具的情况很普遍。在各地街头巷尾，经常能够看到儿童们三五成群地匍伏在地上弹弄玻璃球。我觉得用玻璃球给儿童作玩具，不仅对体力和智慧没有什么良好作用，而且会造成生命的危险。如山东省原章历县就曾发生过农民李洪泽的孩子把玻璃球咽入气管致死的不幸事件。为了保障儿童的身体健康，免除儿童在这方面可能发生的危险事件，我认为各地小学教师和儿童家长应注意教育、引导儿童作一些其它有益的娱乐活动，切勿买玻璃球给儿童玩弄。各地人民政府的工商行政管理部门对于经营玻璃球的厂商，应根据具体情况，动员他们停止制造和销售，或者动员他们改制其它对儿童有利的玩具。
   （二）
    读者周淑明、周静宇等来信：我们在某些城市里常常看到商贩们贩卖小孩玩的玻璃喇叭。这些喇叭的形状像半个葫芦，底部是平的，有个很长的细管。如果把它衔在嘴里一呼一吸，就可以发出“古达”“古达”的响声。我们认为：这种玻璃喇叭是不宜给儿童作玩具的。我曾亲眼看到一个孩子在玩弄这种玻璃喇叭时，因为用力稍大，竟将喇叭的底部吸破，把玻璃碎片吸到嘴里，险些咽入喉咙。为此，建议各地政府的工商行政管理部门制止私营厂商的生产和经营类似这种对儿童有害的玩具。
