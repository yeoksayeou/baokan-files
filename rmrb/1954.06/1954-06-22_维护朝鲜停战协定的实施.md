    Upholding the Implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement
    Recently, following the United States' disruption of the Korean issue negotiations, the Syngman Rhee clique has repeatedly issued provocative clamors. After Byun Young-tae publicly stated that South Korea "no longer considers itself obligated to abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement," and Syngman Rhee also threatened to formulate a "new policy of marching north to unify Korea," Cho Chung-hwan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Syngman Rhee clique, shamelessly declared on June 18 that South Korea would demand that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "cease its inspection activities in South Korea." The Syngman Rhee clique's arrogant and destructive attitude towards the Korean Armistice Agreement and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is clearly a dire consequence of the United States' disruption of the Korean issue negotiations. The United States must bear the primary responsibility for this.
    The United States has long been deliberately trying to undermine the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Not long ago, the United States extensively slandered the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, one of its purposes being to create a pretext in an attempt to abolish this organization. Now, Cho Chung-hwan's clamor even more bluntly exposes this ulterior motive of the United States. In the eyes of the United States, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is a thorn in its side, an obstacle. If this organization is abolished, it will greatly benefit the United States in carrying out its conspiracy plans in Korea as it pleases, massively transporting large quantities of weapons and ammunition to arm Syngman Rhee's army, and expanding the United States' military bases and military strength in South Korea, making the already achieved Korean armistice even more unstable, so as to threaten the peace and security of Korea, China, and Asia. People cannot but notice that while the United States is brazenly disrupting the Korean issue negotiations, its conspiracy activities are becoming even more intense.
    However, everyone knows that the establishment and authority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are stipulated by the Korean Armistice Agreement, and it is an inseparable component of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Moreover, the facts since the Korean armistice show that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has made positive and active achievements in assisting the implementation of the armistice agreement. It has effectively monitored the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials entering and leaving Korea, conducted regular inspections at designated rear ports throughout Korea, and conducted special investigations into violations of the agreement. All these favorable contributions to ensuring the Korean armistice cannot be erased by any American liars. In fact, it is the United States that has created difficulties for the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and these difficulties are not insurmountable.
    Today, after the United States has disrupted the negotiations on the Korean issue, the urgent task is to ensure the continued implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and strive to consolidate peace in Korea. At such a time, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission must be given greater respect, and its role should be strengthened, not weakened. Therefore, the demands of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to stop the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission are fundamentally untenable and illegal. This arrogant clamor cannot but be regarded as a step in an attempt to dismember the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is bound to be resolutely opposed by all people who care about peace in Korea and the world. Today, the neutral member states of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should more resolutely safeguard the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the implementation of the armistice agreement. If some of their members waver on this issue, it will only benefit the destructive activities of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, and peace-loving people around the world cannot forgive this attitude.
    The attempt by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the current armistice situation in Korea is not allowed. The Korean Armistice Agreement is a historic victory won by the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world against the forces of aggression, and it must not be undermined in any way. Since the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world have the power to achieve peace in Korea, they also have the power to strive to consolidate this peace and to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. If the US warmongering clique dares to act recklessly, it will suffer even greater pain.

### 维护朝鲜停战协定的实施

    维护朝鲜停战协定的实施
    最近，在美国破坏朝鲜问题谈判之后，李承晚集团接连发出挑衅性叫嚣。在卞荣泰公开声称南朝鲜“不再认为有义务遵守朝鲜停战协定”，李承晚也扬言将拟订“北进统一朝鲜的新政策”以后，李承晚集团外务部副长官曹正焕竟又于六月十八日狂妄地表示，南朝鲜将要求中立国监察委员会“停止其在南朝鲜的视察活动”。李承晚集团对朝鲜停战协定和中立国监察委员会所采取的这种狂妄的破坏态度，显然是美国破坏朝鲜问题谈判的恶劣后果。美国必须对此负起主要的责任。
    美国早就蓄意要破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会。不久以前美国曾大肆诽谤中立国监察委员会，其目的之一就是要制造借口，企图取消这个机构。现在曹正焕的叫嚷更加露骨地把美国这个不可告人的目的揭穿了。在美国看来，中立国监察委员会是它的眼中钉，是碍手碍脚的东西，如果把这个机构取消，就会大大有利于美国在朝鲜为所欲为地实行它的阴谋计划，大规模地运进大量武器和军火以武装李承晚的军队，并扩充美国在南朝鲜的军事基地和军事力量，使已经取得的朝鲜停战处于更加不稳定的状态中，以威胁朝鲜、中国和亚洲的和平和安全。人们不能不注意到，美国在悍然破坏朝鲜问题谈判的同时，它的这种阴谋活动是更为紧张了。
    但是，谁都知道，中立国监察委员会的成立及其职权，乃是朝鲜停战协定所规定的，它是朝鲜停战协定的不可分割的组成部分。而且朝鲜停战以来的事实表明，中立国监察委员会对于协助实施停战协定，是有着肯定的和积极的成绩的。它有效地监察了进出朝鲜的军事人员的轮换和作战物资的替换，在朝鲜全境的特定后方口岸进行了经常的视察，并对违反协定的事件进行了特别的调查。所有这些对于保障朝鲜停战有利的贡献，都是任何美国说谎家所不可能抹煞的。事实上，给中立国监察委员会的工作造成困难的就是美国，而这些困难并不是不能解决的。
    今天，在美国破坏了朝鲜问题的谈判以后，迫切的任务在于保证朝鲜停战协定的继续实施，并争取巩固朝鲜的和平。在这样的时候，中立国监察委员会必须受到更大的尊重，它的作用应当加强，而不是削弱。因此，美国和李承晚集团关于停止中立国监察委员会活动的要求，是根本站不住脚的，而且是非法的。这种狂妄的叫嚷不能不认为是一种企图肢解朝鲜停战协定的步骤。它必然遭到所有关心朝鲜及世界和平的人民的断然反对。今天，朝鲜中立国监察委员会各中立国委员应该更加坚决维护中立国监察委员会，维护停战协定的实施。他们之中有的委员如果对于这个问题发生动摇，那就只能有利于美国和李承晚集团的破坏活动，世界爱好和平人民对于这种态度是不能原谅的。
    美国及李承晚集团企图破坏现在朝鲜的停战局面，是不能容许的。朝鲜停战协定是朝、中人民及全世界和平人民反对侵略势力所赢得的历史性的胜利成果，它是绝对不容任何破坏的。朝、中人民及全世界和平人民既然有力量取得了朝鲜的和平，也就有力量争取巩固这个和平，并有力量争取和平解决朝鲜问题。美国好战集团如果胆敢蛮干下去，它就要吃更大的苦头。
