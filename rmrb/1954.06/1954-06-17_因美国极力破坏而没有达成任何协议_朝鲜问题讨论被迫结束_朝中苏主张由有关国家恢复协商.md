Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 15th: The Geneva Conference discussion on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue held its 15th, and final, plenary meeting on the 15th. British Foreign Secretary Eden served as chairman.

At the meeting on the 15th, the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China, in line with their consistent sincere desire and spirit of consultation to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, made constructive and significant efforts in succession, putting forward three new proposals to help reach an agreement, in the hope of saving the conference from collapse at the last moment. However, the delegations of certain countries, headed by the United States, summarily rejected these proposals without even carefully studying them. What they pursued was to prevent the conference from reaching any agreement. They only cared about reading the joint declaration of the sixteen nations to make the conference finally break down on the 15th. Even when the delegations of some of the sixteen nations expressed agreement with the Chinese delegation's proposal to resume appropriate negotiations in the future in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the American representative Smith hurriedly opposed it. The Geneva Conference discussion on the Korean issue, which lasted fifty-one days, finally ended without reaching any agreement due to the sabotage of the US authorities.

The chief representative of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Foreign Minister Nam Il, spoke first at the meeting on the 15th (full text to be published separately). Foreign Minister Nam Il put forward a new proposal on guaranteeing the peaceful state of Korea in order to break the deadlock of the conference. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

	Regarding Guaranteeing the Peaceful State of Korea
	The countries participating in the Geneva Conference agree that they will continue to strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.

	In order to guarantee the peaceful state of Korea:
	1. It is recommended that the governments of the relevant countries take measures to withdraw all foreign troops from Korean territory as soon as possible in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
	The time limit for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea shall be agreed upon by the countries participating in the Geneva Conference.
	2. Within a period not exceeding one year, reduce the military strength of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, and neither side's military strength shall exceed 100,000.
	3. A committee composed of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea shall be formed to study the conditions for gradually ending the state of war, converting the forces of both sides into peacetime status, and recommending the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea to conclude corresponding agreements.
	4. It is considered that the fact that this or that part of Korea has treaties involving military obligations with other countries is incompatible with the interests of the peaceful reunification of Korea.
	5. In order to create conditions for bringing North and South Korea closer together, establish an all-Korean committee to formulate measures for establishing and developing economic and cultural relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, and to implement the agreed measures. (Including trade, account settlement, transportation, border relations, freedom of passage and communication for residents, cultural and scientific relations, and others.)
	6. It is considered necessary for the countries participating in the Geneva Conference to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, and thereby create favorable conditions for the task of peacefully unifying Korea into a unified, independent, and democratic country as soon as possible.

The chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, then spoke (full text to be published separately). Zhou Enlai fully supported the six proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il on the 15th to guarantee peace in Korea, and stated the reasons point by point.

Zhou Enlai said: The six proposals of Foreign Minister Nam Il provide the basic conditions for guaranteeing the peaceful development of Korea. We have no reason not to reach an appropriate agreement on the basis of these six proposals. To this end, the delegation of the People's Republic of China proposes that this conference convene a restricted meeting attended by China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Republic of Korea to discuss relevant measures to consolidate peace in Korea.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke (full text to be published separately). Molotov supported the six proposals put forward by Foreign Minister Nam Il on the 15th and stated his reasons.

Molotov suggested that, in addition to Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal, a joint declaration should be issued by all participants. The draft declaration is as follows:

	“Declaration on Korea
	The countries participating in the Geneva Conference have agreed that, pending the final settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic country, no action shall be taken that may threaten the maintenance of peace in Korea.
	The participants express their belief that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea will act in accordance with this declaration for the sake of peace.”

Obviously, Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal and Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal for a joint declaration caused panic among the United States and its followers. The delegations of the fifteen countries participating in the aggression against Korea and South Korea held a tense consultation for forty minutes during the conference recess.

The first to speak after the break was the American representative Smith. Smith did not mention Foreign Minister Nam Il's six proposals at all. He rejected Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal for a joint declaration, using the excuse that the Korean Armistice Agreement already had provisions. Smith even refused to accept such a declaration expressing the desire to maintain peace in Korea, which can only be explained as the United States pursuing a recurrence of war.

Australian representative Casey then spoke. He admitted that there was not enough time to study Foreign Minister Nam Il's proposal, but he rashly rejected it. Casey admitted that there was nothing to oppose in Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal. He vaguely said that the proposal was "generally" acceptable.

The statement by Philippine representative Garcia, in addition to defending the United Nations' act of aggression against Korea under the manipulation of the United States, had nothing new.

Belgian representative Spaak then spoke. Spaak said: He hoped that even if the conference was not successful, the war would not break out again. He also expressed the hope that in the near future, he could come back to see if an agreement could be reached on the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, he also stated that he did not accept Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal for a joint declaration. Spaak said: The reason for not accepting this proposal is because the American representative opposed it just now. He said: Otherwise, this proposal would have been acceptable.

South Korean representative Byun Young-tae, in his speech, made shameless slanders against Foreign Minister Nam Il's and Foreign Minister Molotov's proposals. He refused to reach any agreement at the meeting.

Then, Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon read out the joint declaration of the sixteen nations. In this declaration, the countries that invaded Korea announced their determination to end the meeting without reaching any agreement. This declaration also vainly attempted to shirk the responsibility for sabotaging the Geneva Conference on the United States and its vassal states. Everyone knows that the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, China, and the Soviet Union have repeatedly put forward constructive proposals during the discussion process. Even at today's meeting, Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Molotov put forward proposals aimed at strengthening peace in Korea. However, the United States and its vassal states brazenly rejected these proposals without any consideration. Ironclad facts prove that it was not others who sabotaged the Geneva Conference's discussion on the Korean issue, but the United States and its vassals.

Foreign Minister Molotov then spoke. Molotov said, we are facing the end of our meeting on the Korean issue. The motion to end the meeting was put forward by those who just read a declaration on behalf of sixteen countries that had been fighting in Korea for several years.

Molotov said that the proposal made by the Soviet delegation, synthesizing the views of various delegations, has been rejected by some other delegations today. The sixteen countries that fought in Korea for three years have not been able to propose a counter-proposal to our proposals. They are unwilling to accept the Soviet proposal, but they cannot put forward a counter-proposal to summarize the general principles that this conference can agree on. Moreover, the proposals previously put forward by these delegations have suddenly disappeared. I don't know why. But this is an important fact that I think is worth noting. The significance of the discussions we have had on unification and the various views that have been expressed are now completely clear after what has happened today.

Molotov said that people can draw the following conclusions from all the debates: these delegations have a very clear goal. They are trying to impose the anti-national, anti-democratic South Korean regime on North Korea, and they want to use the Geneva Conference to achieve this goal. However, these attempts have not been realized, and that is why no agreement can be accepted by the Lee Seung-man delegation and those who support it.

Molotov said that the meeting also considered the second important issue, namely the issue of strengthening peace in Korea. Foreign Minister Nam Il's six-point proposal was aimed at achieving this specific goal. However, these proposals were also rejected by the South Korean delegation and those who supported it. Molotov pointed out that the arguments of those who opposed Nam Il's proposal were very poor, and their purpose was only to put aside the issue of strengthening peace in Korea.

Molotov said that the significance of the joint declaration proposed by the Soviet delegation is simple and clear. Even those who try to find fault with the proposals of the Korean and Soviet delegations cannot find anything to use against this declaration. Molotov said that the American representative Smith tried to use Article 62 of the Armistice Agreement to oppose this declaration. But is there only an armistice agreement? There is also the Geneva Conference convened for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and the Korean people are hoping that this conference will say a word for peace, a word that will make the Korean people believe that peace will be strengthened in their country. Molotov pointed out that South Korea, under the protection of the United States, is saying day after day that it will launch a new crusade against North Korea. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Geneva Conference should speak for strengthening peace in Korea and for world peace.

Molotov pointed out that the representatives of the so-called capitalist countries have attempted to link their policies and their proposals with the Lee Seung-man regime. This group of countries has expressed the conclusion of the work of the Geneva Conference in the declaration they took out of their pockets and read this afternoon. There is not a word in this declaration that can be considered beneficial to the cause of peace in Korea.

After stating the Soviet Union's position on the Korean issue, Molotov said that the democratic classes of the whole world will say that the sixteen-nation declaration is not conducive to the unification of Korea, nor is it conducive to strengthening the peaceful development of Korea. Molotov hoped that the proposals that the DPRK, China, and the Soviet Union have put forward as honest and fair steps towards the early unification of Korea and the strengthening of peace in Korea will be of great interest to the Korean people. He said that we will continue our struggle in this regard. We will continue to work for the interests of the Korean people, for the unification of Korea, and for the peace of the world.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai then spoke.

Zhou Enlai said that the delegation of the People's Republic of China cannot agree with the attitude and position of the sixteen-nation declaration read by the relevant countries of the United Nations Command through the Thai representative. Because the Geneva Conference was convened in accordance with the agreement of the Berlin Conference, it has nothing to do with the United Nations, and the People's Republic of China has been deprived of its legitimate rights and status in the United Nations. At the same time, the sixteen-nation declaration is resolutely expressing its intention to stop our meeting, which cannot but make us feel extremely regretful.

Zhou Enlai expressed his full support for Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal that the participating countries issue a joint declaration. Zhou Enlai said that it is regrettable that even such a proposal expressing a common desire was unreasonably and resolutely rejected by the American representative. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the arguments used by the American representative to reject Molotov's proposal are untenable. Because the Korean Armistice Agreement can only bind the belligerent parties in Korea, while the Geneva Conference is convened on a new and broader basis, and it must have its own agreement. Zhou Enlai pointed out that the American representative and some of its adherents are not only deliberately obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, but also want to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching any agreement on the issue of maintaining and consolidating peace in Korea.

Zhou Enlai said that although the situation is like this, we still have the obligation to reach some kind of agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and he believes that the desire to continue to strive to achieve a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state should be common. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai put forward the following suggestion:

	"The countries participating in the Geneva Conference reach an agreement that they will continue to strive to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korean state.
	The time and place for resuming appropriate negotiations will be agreed upon separately by the relevant countries."

Zhou Enlai said that if such a proposal is rejected by the relevant countries of the United Nations Command, then this spirit of rejecting consultation and reconciliation will leave a very bad influence on international conferences.

Foreign Minister Nam Il then spoke. Nam Il pointed out that the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward proposals for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue at the beginning of the meeting, and later accepted the proposals of the delegations of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, but these proposals were rejected by the South Korean representative and those who supported him. Nam Il said that we have put forward proposals to strengthen the conditions for peace in Korea today, but they have also been rejected by them. Nam Il pointed out that those people have not been able to put forward any decent arguments against these proposals. They are just trying to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Nam Il said that the responsibility for the interruption of the Geneva Conference will be borne by the representatives of the sixteen countries who issued the declaration today and those who support this declaration. Nam Il said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is loyal to its peace-loving policy and will continue to fight for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Nam Il wholeheartedly supported the proposal just put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai.

Thai representative Prince Wan Waithayakon then spoke. He only vainly tried to convince people that the sixteen-nation declaration he read was not an attempt to sabotage the meeting.

Belgian representative Spaak spoke. He said: Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal are not contradictory to the spirit of the sixteen-nation declaration. He insisted: Molotov's proposal and Zhou Enlai's proposal are already included in the Korean Armistice Agreement. Spaak also expressed the hope that discussions on the Korean issue would resume in "more favorable circumstances" in the future.

Molotov then spoke. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation fully and wholeheartedly supports the proposal just put forward by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai.

British representative Marquess of Reading spoke. He said: If the meeting has not achieved results, this does not mean that we have given up hope for the future. He agreed with Spaak's opinion.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai spoke again. He said: Spaak just said that the final proposal of the delegation of the People's Republic of China has been included in the Korean Armistice Agreement, this statement is unfounded. The Korean Armistice Agreement does not stipulate that the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should reach an agreement, expressing their willingness to continue to strive to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and establish a unified, independent, and democratic Korea.

Zhou Enlai said: The Chinese delegation participated in this international conference for the first time with the spirit of consultation and reconciliation. If the last proposal we put forward today is rejected by the relevant countries of the United Nations Command, then we cannot but express our greatest regret for this fact. Peace-loving people all over the world will judge this fact.

Spaak then spoke. He said that he wanted to clarify his previous statement. He said that he meant that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal was consistent with the spirit of the sixteen-nation declaration and also consistent with his own opinion. He expressed his belief that the British representative and other representatives of the participating countries also agreed with his opinion.

After Spaak spoke, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said: If the sixteen-nation declaration and the final proposal of the Chinese delegation have a common desire, then the sixteen-nation declaration is only a one-sided declaration, and nineteen countries participated in the Geneva Conference. Why can't we express this common desire in the form of a common agreement? Don't we have even this spirit of reconciliation to participate in this meeting? If this is the case, then I cannot but express great regret.

Spaak then said: In order to eliminate any doubt, I myself approve of everyone accepting the proposal of the delegation of the People's Republic of China.

Molotov spoke. He said: We are about to end the discussion on the Korean issue. We can end the discussion with a unilateral declaration, or with a declaration expressing the opinion of one side or another, or with a declaration expressing the opinion of all of us. We must answer this question. Are we prepared to issue a declaration representing the opinions and wishes of all of us? I think this is precisely the purpose of our meeting in Geneva. That is why I am willing to support without reservation the proposal of the Chinese delegation, which has just been approved by the Belgian representative.

Chairman Eden then spoke. He said: As far as I understand it, we have a proposal before us made by the representative of the People's Republic of China. If my understanding is correct, the Belgian representative believes that this proposal expresses the spirit of the work of this conference. If everyone agrees, may I assume that this statement has been generally accepted by the conference?

After Eden spoke, there was a short silence in the conference hall, and no one expressed opposition to Eden's opinion.

Because he was very afraid that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal was about to be adopted, the American representative Smith hurriedly spoke. He pretended not to understand the "scope and real issues" of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal. He said he was not prepared to agree to the proposal without consulting the US government.

Eden spoke. He said in his capacity as chairman that this conference is working in a manner of common agreement. According to him, the conference has been unable to reach an agreement on any document. He believes that the conference has noted the speeches at today's meeting and can take these speeches as part of the conference record.

Foreign Minister Molotov spoke. Molotov said: We have heard the speech of the chairman of the meeting, who proposed that the meeting note the speech of the Belgian representative. In his speech, the Belgian representative expressed his support for the proposal of the Chinese representative, because this proposal reflects the opinion of this conference. I believe that this conference can note this speech. The American representative also made a speech. This conference can also express its attention to the speech of the American representative.

Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai spoke. He said: I am very satisfied with the spirit of reconciliation shown by the Belgian Foreign Minister. The chairman of the meeting asked the meeting to note the proposal put forward by the Chinese delegation and seconded by the Belgian Foreign Minister, which I think is also worth mentioning. However, at the same time, I must point out that the American representative immediately expressed opposition and obstructed it. This makes us all understand how the American representative is obstructing the Geneva Conference and preventing the achievement of even the minimum and most conciliatory proposals. I request that this statement I just made also be part of the record of this conference.

South Korean representative Byun Young-tae opposed reaching any agreement at the meeting. He said: Belgium cannot represent all the countries that invaded Korea, nor can it represent South Korea.

After Eden explained the proposal he had just made in his capacity as chairman, Australian representative Casey disagreed with the section in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's proposal that the time and place for resuming appropriate negotiations would be agreed upon separately by the relevant countries. Casey also advocated that if negotiations were to resume in the future, they should be conducted within the scope of the United Nations.

Molotov once again pointed out that the meeting needed to note the speech of the Belgian representative, which expressed its endorsement of the Chinese delegation's proposal and expressed the expectation that this proposal would reflect the opinions of the participating countries. This opinion was also affirmed by the chairman of the meeting. Therefore, I believe that the meeting should note these speeches and other speeches that express individual opinions. If this is the case, then the Soviet delegation is very willing to agree.

Belgian representative Spaak spoke. He said that he supports the Chinese delegation's proposal, which expresses the hope that the discussion on the Korean issue has not come to an end. He said that he must agree to express this hope. Because, it is unthinkable that anyone would want to no longer discuss the Korean issue in the future. It would be a very serious and very unfortunate thing to oppose such a discussion. However, Spaak also stated that future discussions should be conducted within the scope of the United Nations.

Zhou Enlai then spoke. He said: Can what some representatives said be interpreted as the People's Republic of China will be excluded from any future negotiations on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue? If so, then we believe that it seems impossible to reach an agreement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in the future. Because, ladies and gentlemen, you know that the People's Republic of China has been deprived of its legitimate rights and due status in the United Nations.

Eden spoke. He said that in his capacity as chairman, he proposed that the meeting not adopt any of the documents that have been put forward as a collective agreement of the meeting. However, these documents, along with the speeches, will become part of the record of the meeting. Eden finally expressed the hope that the day when the work of the meeting can be successfully completed will come soon.

The meeting ended at 8:36 pm.

### 因美国极力破坏而没有达成任何协议  朝鲜问题讨论被迫结束  朝中苏主张由有关国家恢复协商

    因美国极力破坏而没有达成任何协议
    朝鲜问题讨论被迫结束
    朝中苏主张由有关国家恢复协商
    据新华社日内瓦十五日电：日内瓦会议关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论在十五日举行第十五次、也是最后一次的全体会议。英国外交大臣艾登担任主席。
    在十五日的会议上，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国的代表团，本着一贯的谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望和协商精神，接连作了建设性的重大努力，先后提出了三个有助于达成协议的新建议，以期在最后时刻挽救会议免于破裂。然而，以美国为首的某些国家的代表团，根本没有仔细研究这些建议，就断然加以拒绝。它们追求的是使会议不能达成任何协议。他们只关心以宣读十六国共同宣言来使会议在十五日最后破裂。甚至当十六国中的某些国家的代表团表示同意中国代表团关于在将来恢复适当谈判以期和平解决朝鲜问题的建议时，美国代表史密斯仓皇加以反对。历时五十一天的日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，终于因美国当局的破坏而没有达成任何协议就告结束。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团首席代表南日外务相在十五日会议上首先发言（全文另发）。南日外务相提出一个关于保证朝鲜的和平状态的新建议，以期打开会议的僵局。建议全文如下：
      关于保证朝鲜的和平状态
    日内瓦会议参加国同意，它们将继续努力谋求在成立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    为了保证朝鲜的和平状态：
    一、建议各有关国家的政府采取措施，遵照按比例的原则尽速从朝鲜境内撤退一切外国军队。
    从朝鲜撤退外国军队的期限，由日内瓦会议的参加国协议决定。
    二、在不超过一年的期限中，缩减朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的军队力量，双方军力不得超过十万人。
    三、由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国的代表组成一个委员会，来研究创造逐步解除战争状态的条件、将双方军队转入和平时期状态等问题，并建议朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和大韩民国政府缔结相应的协定。
    四、认为朝鲜的这一部分或者另一部分和其他国家订有牵涉到军事义务的条约，是和和平统一朝鲜的利益不相容的。
    五、为了创造使南北朝鲜接近的条件，成立一个全朝鲜委员会来拟订建立和发展朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的经济和文化关系的措施，并执行已取得协议的措施。（其中包括贸易、账目结算、运输、边境关系、居民的通行和通信自由、文化和科学关系及其他。）
    六、认为日内瓦会议的参加国有必要保证朝鲜的和平发展，并从而为尽速解决把朝鲜和平统一为一个统一、独立和民主的国家的任务创造有利的条件。
    中华人民共和国代表团首席代表周恩来接着发言（全文另发）。周恩来完全支持南日外务相十五日提出的保证朝鲜和平的六项建议，并逐点申述了理由。
    周恩来说：南日外务相的六项建议提供了保证朝鲜和平发展的基本条件。我们没有理由不能在这六项建议的基础上达成适当协议。为此，中华人民共和国代表团建议本会议召开中、苏、英、美、法、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国七国参加的限制性会议，讨论巩固朝鲜和平的有关措施。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接着发言（全文另发）。莫洛托夫支持南日外务相十五日提出的六项建议，并申述了自己的理由。
    莫洛托夫建议：除了南日外务相的建议以外，由所有与会者发表一项共同宣言。宣言的草案如下：
      “关于朝鲜的宣言
    参加日内瓦会议的各国业已同意：在等待朝鲜问题在建立一个统一、独立、民主国家的基础上最后解决期间，不得采取任何可能足以对维持朝鲜和平构成威胁的行动。
    与会者表示相信，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国将为了和平的利益依照本宣言而行动。”
    显然，南日外务相的建议和莫洛托夫外长关于共同宣言的建议，在美国及其追随者中引起了慌乱。参加侵略朝鲜的十五个国家和南朝鲜的代表团在会议休息期间进行了四十分钟紧张的会商。
    休息后第一个发言的是美国代表史密斯。史密斯根本不提南日外务相的六项建议。他以朝鲜停战协定已有规定为借口，拒绝莫洛托夫外长所提出的关于共同宣言的建议。史密斯甚至连这样一个表示对维持朝鲜和平的愿望的宣言都拒绝接受，这只能解释为美国追求的是战争之再起。
    澳大利亚代表凯西接着发言。他承认还没有充分时间来研究南日外务相的建议，但是他却轻率地拒绝了这个建议。凯西承认莫洛托夫外长的建议中没有什么可以反对的。他含糊其辞地说，这个建议“大致上”是可以同意的。
    菲律宾代表加西亚的发言除了为联合国在美国操纵下侵略朝鲜的行为辩护以外，没有任何新的东西。
    比利时代表斯巴克接着发言。斯巴克说：他希望即使会议没有得到成功，战事也不会再起。他还表示，希望不久将来能再来看看能不能在和平统一朝鲜方面达成协议。然而，他却又表示不接受莫洛托夫外长关于共同宣言的建议。斯巴克说：不接受这一建议的理由就是因为刚才美国代表反对这一建议。他说：否则，这一建议本来是可以接受的。
    南朝鲜代表卞荣泰在发言中对南日外务相和莫洛托夫外长的建议，进行了无耻的诬蔑。他拒绝会议达成任何协议。
    接着，泰国代表旺亲王宣读了十六国共同宣言。侵朝国家在这个宣言中宣布他们决心使会议在未达成任何协议的情况下结束。这个宣言还徒劳地企图替美国和它的仆从国推卸破坏日内瓦会议的罪责。大家知道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中国和苏联代表团在讨论过程中曾经多次提出了建设性的建议。就是在今天的会议上，南日外务相和莫洛托夫外长还提出了旨在加强朝鲜和平的建议。然而，美国和它的仆从国家却毫不加考虑就悍然拒绝了这些建议。铁的事实证明，破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题讨论的不是别人，而是美国和它的仆从。
    莫洛托夫外长接着发言。莫洛托夫说，我们正面临结束我们关于朝鲜问题的会议。结束会议的动议是由那些刚才代表十六个在朝鲜作战了几年的国家的宣读了一项宣言的人提出来的。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团综合各代表团的观点而提出的建议，今天已经被其他一些代表团所拒绝。十六个在朝鲜进行了三年战争的国家没有能够对我们已经提出的建议提出反建议。他们不愿意接受苏联的建议，然而他们提不出反建议来总括出本会议能够同意的一般原则。而且，这些代表团以前提出过的建议都忽然不见了。我不知道为什么。但是这是我认为值得注意的重要事实。我们在统一问题上有过的讨论和曾经表示过的各种观点的意义，在今天发生的事情以后，现在完全清楚了。
    莫洛托夫说，人们从所有的辩论中可以得出下列结论：这些代表团有一个很明确的目标。他们企图把反民族、反民主的南朝鲜政权强加于北朝鲜，并且他们要利用日内瓦会议来达到这个目的。然而，这些企图没有实现，而这就是再也没有任何协议可以为李承晚代表团以及那些支持它的代表团所接受的原因。
    莫洛托夫说，会议也考虑了第二个重要的问题，即加强朝鲜和平的问题。南日外务相的六点建议就是为了达到这个特定的目标。然而这些建议也遭到了南朝鲜代表团和那些支持它的代表团的拒绝。莫洛托夫指出，那些反对南日建议的人的论据都是十分可怜的，他们的目的只是为了要抛开加强朝鲜和平的问题。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团所建议的共同宣言的意义是简单明了的。甚至那些企图在朝、苏两国代表团的建议中找岔子的人也找不出可以用来反对这个宣言的东西。莫洛托夫说，美国代表史密斯企图用停战协定第六十二款来反对这个宣言。但是不是只有一个停战协定，还有一个为了和平解决朝鲜问题而召开的日内瓦会议，而朝鲜人民都在希望这个会议为和平说一句话，说一句会使朝鲜人民相信和平将在他们国内加强的话。莫洛托夫指出在美国保护之下的南朝鲜，一天接一天地说着要对北朝鲜发动新的十字军。因此，日内瓦会议应当为加强朝鲜和平、为世界和平说话，这是用不着奇怪的事情。
    莫洛托夫指出，所谓资本主义国家的代表已经企图把它们的政策和它们的建议和李承晚政权连结在一起。这一国家集团对于日内瓦会议工作的结论，已经表示在他们从口袋里掏出来的、在今天下午念过的宣言中。在这个宣言中没有一句话可以被认为是对朝鲜和平事业有利的。
    莫洛托夫申述了苏联在朝鲜问题上的立场以后说，全世界的民主阶层将要说，十六国宣言不是有助于朝鲜的统一的，也不是有助于加强朝鲜的和平发展的。莫洛托夫希望朝、中、苏三国已经提出的作为走向及早统一朝鲜以及加强朝鲜和平的诚实而公正的步骤的建议，将使朝鲜人民感到巨大的兴趣。他说，我们将继续我们在这方面的斗争。我们将继续为朝鲜人民的利益，为统一朝鲜的利益，为全世界和平的利益而努力。
    周恩来外长接着发言。
    周恩来说，中华人民共和国代表团不能同意联合国军方面有关各国经过泰国代表所宣读的十六国宣言的态度和立场。因为日内瓦会议是根据柏林会议的协议召开的，它和联合国并无关系，而中华人民共和国又被剥夺了它在联合国中应享受的合法权利和地位。同时，十六国宣言是在断然表示要停止我们的会议，这不能不使我们感到极大的遗憾。
    周恩来表示完全支持莫洛托夫外长关于与会各国发表共同宣言的建议。周恩来说，很遗憾的是，就连这样一个表示共同愿望的建议，都被美国代表毫无道理地断然拒绝了。周恩来指出，美国代表用来拒绝莫洛托夫的建议的论据是站不住的。因为朝鲜停战协定只能约束朝鲜交战双方，而日内瓦会议是在新的更广大的基础上召开的，它必须有它自己的协议。周恩来指出，美国代表和它的一些附和者们不仅蓄意阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，而且要阻挠日内瓦会议对于维持和巩固朝鲜和平的问题达成任何协议。
    周恩来说，情况虽然如此，我们仍然有义务对和平解决朝鲜问题达成某种协议，他认为对于继续努力以期在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上获致和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望应该是共同的。周恩来外长提出了如下的建议：
    “日内瓦与会国家达成协议，它们将继续努力以期在建立统一、独立和民主的朝鲜国家的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。
    关于恢复适当谈判的时间和地点问题，将由有关国家另行商定。”
    周恩来说，如果这样一个建议都被联合国军有关国家所拒绝，那么，这种拒绝协商和和解的精神，将为国际会议留下一个极不良的影响。
    南日外务相接着发言。南日指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团在会议一开始的时候就提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，后来又接受了中华人民共和国和苏联代表团的建议，但是这些建议都遭到了南朝鲜代表和支持他的人的拒绝。南日说，我们今天又提出了加强朝鲜和平条件的建议，但又同样地遭到了他们的拒绝。南日指出，那些人反对这些建议并没有能够提出任何像样的论据来。他们只是企图阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。南日说，日内瓦会议中断的责任，将由今天发表宣言的十六国的代表以及那些支持这个宣言的人担负。南日表示，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国忠于它的爱好和平的政策，并将继续为和平统一朝鲜而斗争。南日衷心支持周恩来外长刚才提出的建议。
    泰国代表旺亲王接着发言。他只是徒然地企图使人相信他所宣读的十六国宣言并不是企图破坏会议。
    比利时代表斯巴克发言。他说：莫洛托夫外长的建议以及周恩来外长的建议是和十六国宣言的精神不矛盾的。他硬说：莫洛托夫的建议和周恩来的建议已经包括在朝鲜停战协定中。斯巴克还表示希望以后将在“更有利的环境下”恢复关于朝鲜问题的讨论。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。莫洛托夫表示苏联代表团完全并衷心地支持周恩来外长刚才提出的建议。
    英国代表里丁侯爵发言。他说：如果会议没有达到结果，这并不意味着我们放弃了对将来的希望。他同意斯巴克的意见。
    周恩来外长再次发言。他说：斯巴克刚才说中华人民共和国代表团最后的建议已被包括在朝鲜停战协定中，这种说法是没有根据的。朝鲜停战协定并没有规定日内瓦会议与会各国应该达成一个协议，表示他们愿意继续努力以和平解决朝鲜问题，建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜。
    周恩来说：中国代表团带着协商和和解的精神第一次参加这个国际会议。如果我们今天提出的最后一个建议被联合国军方面有关国家拒绝了，那么我们不能不对这一事实表示最大的遗憾。全世界爱好和平的人民将对这一事实作出判断。
    斯巴克接着发言。他说，他要澄清他刚才的发言。他说，他的意思是说，周恩来外长的建议是和十六国宣言的精神一致的，也和他自己的意见一致。他表示相信英国代表和其他与会各国代表也同意他的意见。
    斯巴克发言后，周恩来外长说：如果十六国宣言和中国代表团的最后建议有着共同的愿望，那么，十六国宣言只是一方面的宣言，而日内瓦会议则有十九个国家参加。我们为什么不可以用共同协议的形式来表示这一共同愿望呢？难道我们来参加这一会议却连这点和解的精神都没有吗？如果是这样的话，那么我不能不表示很大遗憾。
    斯巴克接着说：为了消除任何怀疑，我本身赞成大家接受中华人民共和国代表团这个建议。
    莫洛托夫发言。他说：我们就要结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论了。我们可以用一个单方面的宣言来结束讨论，也可以用一个表示一方或另一方意见的宣言来结束讨论，还可以用一个表示我们大家意见的宣言来结束讨论。我们必须回答这个问题。我们是不是准备发表一个代表我们大家的意见和愿望的宣言呢？我认为，这正是我们在日内瓦开会的目的。这就是为什么我愿无保留地支持刚刚得到比利时代表赞成的中国代表团的建议。
    主席艾登接着发言。他说：据我了解，我们面前有一个中华人民共和国代表所提出的建议。如果我的了解是正确的话，比利时代表认为这个建议表达了本会议工作的精神。如果大家同意，我可否认为，这个声明已为会议所普遍接受？
    艾登发言后，会场短时寂静，没有人表示反对艾登的意见。
    由于十分害怕周恩来外长的建议眼看就要被通过，美国代表史密斯仓皇发言。他假装做不了解周恩来外长的建议的“范围和真正的问题”。他说他不准备在未向美国政府请示的情况下同意这个建议。
    艾登发言。他以主席的身份说：本会议是以共同协议的办法来工作的。据他看来会议已无法就任何文件达成协议。他认为会议已注意到今天会议上的发言，可以把这些发言作为会议记录的组成部分。
    莫洛托夫外长发言。莫洛托夫说：我们听到了会议主席的发言，他提议会议表示注意到比利时代表的发言。比利时代表在发言中表示支持中国代表的建议，因为这一建议反映了本会议的意见。我相信，本会议可以注意到这一发言。美国代表也作了一个发言。本会议也可以表示注意到美国代表的发言。
    周恩来外长发言。他说：我对比利时外交大臣所表现的和解精神感到很满意。会议主席要求会议注意到中国代表团所提出的并为比利时外交大臣所附议的建议，我认为也是值得提及的。然而，同时我必须指出，美国代表立刻表示反对并进行阻挠。这就使我们大家都了解到美国代表如何阻挠日内瓦会议，并阻止达成即使是最低限度的、最具有和解性的建议。我要求，我刚才所作的这一发言也作为本会议记录的一部分。
    南朝鲜代表卞荣泰表示反对会议达成任何协议。他说：比利时不能代表全体侵朝国家，也不能代表南朝鲜。
    在艾登解释他刚才以主席身份所作的提议后，澳大利亚代表凯西表示不同意周恩来外长建议中关于恢复适当谈判的时间和地点问题将由有关国家另行商定的一节。凯西还主张，将来如果恢复谈判，应在联合国范围之内进行。
    莫洛托夫再次指出会议有必要注意到比利时代表的发言，这一发言表示附议中国代表团的建议，并表示期望这一建议将反映与会各国的意见。这一意见也为会议的主席所肯定。因此，我认为，会议应注意到这些发言以及那些表示个别意见的其他发言。如果是这样的话，那么苏联代表团很愿意同意。
    比利时代表斯巴克发言。他说，他支持中国代表团的建议，这一建议表示希望关于朝鲜问题的讨论没有最后结束。他说，他必须同意表示这一希望。因为，不能设想任何人会希望以后不再讨论朝鲜问题。如果反对这种讨论，将是一个很严重的事情和很不幸的事情。但是，斯巴克又表示将来的讨论应在联合国范围内进行。
    周恩来接着发言。他说：对于有些代表所说的话，是否可解释作中华人民共和国将被排斥在将来关于和平解决朝鲜问题的任何谈判之外？如果是这样，那么我们认为，将来就和平解决朝鲜问题达成协议似乎是不可能的。因为，诸位先生知道，中华人民共和国被剥夺了它在联合国中的合法权利和应有地位。
    艾登发言。他说，他以主席身份提议会议不通过任何已经提出的文件作为会议的集体协议。但是，这些文件和发言一起将成为会议记录的一部分。艾登最后表示希望使会议的工作得以圆满成功的日子及早到来。
    会议于下午八时三十六分结束。
