In order to further consolidate and develop the profound friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean people, and to further strengthen the cultural exchange that has a long historical tradition between the two peoples, the Art Troupe of the Korean People's Delegation to China came to visit our great neighbor, China. Today, it has successfully completed this glorious mission and is about to return home.

It has been more than three months since our delegation's Art Troupe began performing at Huairentang in Beijing on March 16th. During this time, we visited vast areas of China, reaching Lanzhou in the west, Guangzhou in the south, Chongqing in the southwest, and Harbin in the northeast, passing through twenty-eight major cities, performing one hundred and twenty-nine times. We received a warm welcome from the Chinese people and enthusiastic assistance, enabling us to successfully complete this visiting performance mission. All members of our Art Troupe would like to express our deepest gratitude and pay our highest respects to the fraternal Chinese people.

Every time we performed, whether in a theater or in a square, the Chinese people greeted us with enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause. Chinese newspapers and magazines, including the People's Daily, published introductions and reviews of our performances, expressing their love for our performances. At the same time, among the many precious gifts given to us by the Chinese people, many were related to culture, which will play a significant role in developing the cultural and artistic exchange between our two peoples.

We clearly know that the Chinese people's welcome and understanding of our art is precisely a welcome and understanding of Korean artists who have undergone the arduous trials of war and are selflessly striving to develop their new national culture.

During our performance in Chongqing, the stage was soaked by heavy rain, so we sprinkled sawdust on it and continued to perform the dance "Son of the Motherland." At that moment, many of the 35,000 audience members were moved to tears by the heroic deeds of Park Suk-bong, who used his fiery youthful chest to block the enemy's gun muzzle. Especially when the audience erupted in狂热 applause and shouts, we immediately recalled such a day -- it was on the Korean front line, when it was raining heavily, and we were still performing this dance in the front-line trenches.

When thousands upon thousands of audience members listened to the "Song of the Automobile Driver" and burst into enthusiastic applause, we thought of the brave soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers transportation units who transported grain and ammunition to the front line day and night while enemy planes bombed the Xin'gaoshan seventy-mile plain; and we also thought of the scene when we created this song together with them in underground tunnels, sharing hardships and singing this song together.

When the performance of the "Rose" dance received thunderous cheers and applause from the audience, we couldn't help but recall the scene when we persisted in practicing this dance in the fields by the Yalu River, in the biting cold wind, during the temporary retreat period. In Baoding, we performed "Korea in Battle" for the wounded and honored veterans of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. When we were moved by the enthusiastic emotions of these veterans covered in glory, we thought of the scene when we first performed this program in the Peony Peak underground theater: although enemy planes were constantly bombing above our heads, we continued to perform with even deeper hatred for the enemy. The fraternal Chinese people understand all of this. It is precisely because they have such an understanding that they have shown welcome and love for our art. Through each performance, not only has our enthusiasm been further encouraged, but also it has made us more deeply appreciate that the friendship between our two peoples forged with blood is becoming increasingly consolidated.

During this visiting performance, we also visited the great socialist construction taking place on the vast land of China and learned a lot. We were all inspired by this solemn construction cause, and we were also excited to regard the achievements of the Chinese people's "blooming of a hundred flowers" art and culture as our own achievements. Learning from Chinese art was a major hope of our visit to China. Today, we have seen that the comrades in the Chinese art circles, following the teachings of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, are delving into the masses to experience their lives in order to correctly inherit and develop their own national classical heritage and to collect and organize folk art, while also learning from the advanced art of the Soviet Union in order to better develop their own national art. We have learned from their accumulated experience in this regard and seen their excellent artistic creations.

Our comrades in the dance troupe have learned beautiful dances of Chinese ethnic minorities, the comrades in the opera troupe have learned many Chinese folk songs and new songs, our classical art department has also learned a lot of songs and dances and classical music, and the stage art department has also learned a lot of valuable stage design experience.

Today, the art of New China, based on its own nation's rich and outstanding artistic heritage and following Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, has achieved the unity of national form and socialist content. It is also cultivating new artistic talents, and Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line has illuminated their path forward. Chinese art has the guarantee of a people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and its development will be brilliant and magnificent. No one will doubt this.

Here I would like to especially mention the brilliant development of the art of various ethnic minorities in China under the correct ethnic policy leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In Inner Mongolia, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Changsha, and other places, we saw that the art of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Miao ethnic groups is developing freely and vigorously, and we also saw the brilliant development of Korean ethnic art and culture in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. They use their beautiful and diverse national forms to vividly express their own happy lives, their sense of honor in labor, and their infinite gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

We have also seen that the fraternal Chinese people continue to extensively and deeply carry out the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

These facts deeply moved us, greatly inspired us, and gave us new strength. After returning to our country, we will convey the gains from this visit and the friendship of the fraternal Chinese people to the Korean people. We believe that this will greatly inspire our people who are struggling to rebuild our country. At the same time, we also believe that this will have a tremendous inspirational force for the development of our national culture, and we will do our best to strengthen the cultural exchange between our two peoples.

We sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese artists new victories and greater achievements.

    为加强中朝两国人民的文化交流事业而努力

    为了进一步巩固和发展中朝两国人民以鲜血结成的深厚友谊，为了进一步加强中朝两国人民具有悠久历史传统的文化交流事业，朝鲜人民访华代表团艺术团来访问我们伟大的邻邦——中国，今天已圆满地结束这一光荣的使命，就要回国了。
    我们代表团艺术团三月十六日在北京怀仁堂开始演出以来，有三个多月了。在这期间，我们访问了中国广大的地区，西到兰州，南到广州，西南到重庆，东北到哈尔滨，经过二十八个大城市，演出了
    一百二十九次，受到了中国人民热烈的欢迎并得到了中国人民热情的协助，使我们能够顺利地完成这次访问演出的任务。我们艺术团全体成员谨向兄弟般的中国人民表示深深的感谢和致以崇高的敬意。
    我们每次演出，不管在剧场或在广场，中国人民都给以热烈的欢呼和雷动的掌声。中国的报纸杂志，包括人民日报都为我们的演出发表介绍和评论，对我们的演出表示了热爱。同时在中国人民给我们的许多珍贵礼品中，有很多礼品是文化方面的，这对发展我们中朝两国人民的文化艺术交流事业将起很大的作用。
    我们清楚地知道：中国人民对我们的艺术抱着这样的欢迎和理解，正是对于经过战争的艰苦考验，为发展自己新的民族文化而忘我奋斗的朝鲜艺术工作者的欢迎和理解。
    在重庆演出时，大雨淋湿了舞台，我们就洒上锯末继续演出舞蹈“祖国的儿子”。这时，三万五千观众中有很多人都被那用自己的火热的青春的胸膛堵住敌人枪眼的朴石峰英雄的事迹感动得流出了眼泪。特别当观众响起狂热的掌声和高呼时，我们立刻就想起这样的一天——那是在朝鲜前线，当时外面下着大雨，我们仍在前沿的战壕中上演这个舞蹈。
    当成千上万的观众听完“汽车司机歌”而鼓着热烈的掌声时，我们就想起在敌机轰炸新高山七十里平野时，不分昼夜向前线运送粮食弹药的英勇的人民军和中国人民志愿军的输送部队的勇士们；又想起我们在地下坑道和他们一起同艰共苦创造了这歌曲，并和他们一起高唱这歌曲的情景。
    当“蔷薇”舞蹈的演出受到观众雷动般的欢呼和鼓掌时，我们也不得不想起在暂时后退时期，在鸭绿江边的田野上，在刺骨的寒风中，坚持练习这个舞蹈的情景。在保定我们曾给在抗美援朝战争中负伤的荣誉军人演奏了“朝鲜在战斗”。当我们被这些满身荣誉的观众的热烈情绪感动时，就想到了我们在牡丹峰地下剧场初次上演这个节目时的情景：虽然敌机在我们的头上不断轰炸，可是我们怀着对敌人更深的仇恨继续演奏。兄弟般的中国人民，都理解这些。正因为他们有这样的理解，所以他们对我们的艺术表示了欢迎和热爱，通过每一次的公演，不仅更加鼓舞了我们的热情，并且使得我们更深刻地体会到我们两国人民用鲜血结成的友谊是越发巩固了。
    在这次访问演出中，我们还参观了在中国辽阔的大地上进行着的伟大的社会主义建设，并且学习到了很多的东西。我们都被这庄严的建设事业所鼓舞，我们也把中国人民“百花怒放”的艺术文化的成就当做自己的成就而兴奋。学习中国的艺术，这是我们这次访问中国的一大希望。今天我们看见了中国艺术界的同志们遵循着光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的教导，为了正确的继承和发展自己民族的古典遗产，为了收集和整理民间艺术，他们深入人民群众体验群众的生活，同时学习苏联的先进艺术，以便更好地发展自己的民族艺术。我们学习到了他们在这方面所积累的经验，看到了他们优秀的艺术创作。
    我们舞蹈团的同志们学会了中国少数民族优美的舞蹈，歌剧团的同志学会了很多中国民谣和新歌谣，我们古典艺术部门也学会了不少的歌舞和古典乐，舞台美术部门也学得了许多宝贵的舞台设计经验。
    今天新中国的艺术，依据毛主席的文艺方针，在自己民族丰富的卓越的艺术遗产的基础上，达到了民族形式和社会主义内容的统一。并且正在培养新的艺术人才，毛泽东同志的文艺路线，照亮了他们前进的道路。中国的艺术有着工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度的保障，它的发展将是灿烂辉煌的。这是谁也不会怀疑的。
  这儿我要特别提到在中国共产党正确的民族政策领导下的中国各少数民族艺术的辉煌发展。我们在内蒙古、西安、兰州、长沙等地看见了蒙古族、藏族、苗族的艺术正在自由地生气勃勃地发展着，并且看到了延边朝鲜族自治区朝鲜族艺术文化的灿烂的发展。他们运用自己美丽而多样的民族形式把他们自己的幸福生活，把他们对劳动的荣誉感、把他们对中国共产党和毛主席的无限感激形象地表现出来。
    我们还看到了兄弟般的中国人民继续广泛地深入地展开着抗美援朝运动。
    这样的事实深深地感动了我们，大大地鼓舞了我们，给我们增加了新的力量。我们回到祖国之后，要把这次访问中的收获和兄弟般的中国人民的友情传达给朝鲜人民，我们相信，这一定会极大地鼓舞为重建祖国而斗争的我国人民的。同时，我们也相信，这对我们民族文化的发展也将产生巨大的鼓舞力量，我们将尽全力来加强我们中朝两国人民的文化交流事业。
    我们谨祝兄弟般的中国人民艺术家们取得新的胜利和更大的成就。
