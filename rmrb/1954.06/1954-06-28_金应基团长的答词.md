Dear citizens of Beijing, dear Chinese brothers and sisters:

Our Korean People's Delegation to China has completed its glorious work of visiting the great neighbor—the People's Republic of China—and is now about to return home.

We are about to part with you with a feeling of reluctance. During our visit, our delegation received a warm welcome from the fraternal Chinese people, and we express our heartfelt thanks to you, and respectfully extend our greatest honor and respect to Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people.

For more than three months, under the deep care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, our delegation has visited many proud and great cities of China with a long history of culture and the history of the people's revolutionary struggle. In this process, we have come into contact with cadres of the Chinese Party and government organs, various social organizations, as well as workers, farmers, youth, women, scientific workers, literary and art workers, and some ethnic minorities.

During our visits in various places, we conveyed to the fraternal Chinese people the sincere gratitude and admiration of the Korean people, conveyed the fighting situation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting side by side in the just war of liberation of the fatherland against the American aggressors, and conveyed the achievements of the Korean people in the cause of restoring the post-war people's economy and the unanimous desire and new fighting will for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, China, and the people of various people's democratic countries.

We also visited the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and their families.

We have seen that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, unanimously hope that the Korean people will achieve more brilliant victories, and we have also deeply realized how lovely and precious the friendship and solidarity forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people in the struggle to defend their sacred motherland is.

We have also seen with infinite gratitude the fraternal Chinese people continuing to carry out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and devoting all their strength to helping the Korean people restore post-war economic construction and achieve the just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

As our delegation leaves the capital of the great People's Republic of China—Beijing—let us once again express our heartfelt thanks and high respect to our Chinese brothers and sisters who continue to help us in our post-war construction with practical actions under the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

During our stay in China, we saw the ideological and political unity of the multi-ethnic Chinese people, united like steel around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, fighting for the endless prosperity of the glorious motherland. We also saw the rapid development of the new China in economic and cultural construction and the increasing improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards; and learned the valuable experience created by production innovators in the construction struggle.

The great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong in building a happy new life, as well as the high degree of labor enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people in construction, have greatly encouraged us. We sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on achieving even greater achievements and victories in their future construction endeavors.

Everything great and solemn that we have seen and heard in China over the past three months has left us with an indelible impression. After returning home, we will definitely introduce everything we have experienced in detail to the Korean people, in order to further strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese and Korean people, and to inspire and mobilize the fighting will of the Korean people who are engaged in restoring the post-war people's economic construction and striving for the peaceful reunification of their fatherland.

Dear friends! Goodbye! Although we are separated from you today, our hearts are closely connected in the common cause of justice. For the further consolidation and strengthening of economic and cultural cooperation between China and Korea and the traditional friendship and solidarity between the two peoples, for the defense of the freedom of the Chinese and Korean peoples, for the security of Asia and the lasting peace of the world, let us advance hand in hand!

The Korean people are deeply convinced that the further consolidation and development of the internationalist friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood, will become a powerful guarantee for achieving our common cause. With the support of the socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the great Soviet Union, the unwavering friendly and united force of the Chinese and Korean people will surely shatter any conspiracy by the imperialists who attempt to undermine our just cause.

Finally, as our Korean People's Delegation to China leaves the ancient Chinese capital with a long history, the capital of the People's Republic of China—Beijing—we sincerely congratulate the fraternal Chinese people on achieving new victories in the glorious and lofty cause of China's prosperity, strength, and the defense of peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!

Long live the invincible internationalist friendship and solidarity of the people of all countries in the socialist camp of peace and democracy headed by the great Soviet Union!

    金应基团长的答词亲爱的北京市民们、亲爱的中国兄弟姊妹们：
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团已经结束了访问伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国的光荣工作，现在就要回国了。
    我们怀着惜别的心情要和各位分别了。我们代表团在进行访问期间，受到兄弟般的中国人民的热烈欢迎，我们向你们表示衷心的感谢，并谨向中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席致以最大的荣誉与敬意。
    三个多月来，我们代表团在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席的深切关怀下，访问了中国许多值得自豪的具有悠久文化历史和人民革命斗争历史意义的伟大城市。在这个过程中，我们曾接触过中国的党、政机关、各社会团体的干部以及工人、农民、青年、妇女、科学工作者、文艺工作者和一部分少数民族。
    我们在各地访问中，向兄弟般的中国人民传达了朝鲜人民对他们的热诚感谢和敬仰的心情，传达了在反对美国侵略者的正义的祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军紧密地并肩作战的斗争情形，传达了在伟大的苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民的援助下，朝鲜人民在恢复战后人民经济的事业上取得的成就以及为祖国的和平统一而表示的一致愿望和新的斗争意志。
    我们还访问了中国人民志愿军伤病员及其家属。
    我们看到在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民都一致希望朝鲜人民取得更加光辉的胜利，也深刻地体会到在保卫自己神圣的祖国的斗争中，中、朝两国人民以鲜血凝结成的友谊团结是多么可爱和多么可贵。
    我们还怀着无限感激的心情看到了兄弟般的中国人民为了援助朝鲜人民恢复战后经济建设和达成祖国的和平统一的正义斗争而继续深入开展抗美援朝运动和献出一切力量的高度的热情。
    当我们代表团离开伟大的中华人民共和国首都——北京的时候，让我们再次向在抗美援朝的旗帜下，以实际行动继续帮助我们战后建设的中国兄弟姊妹们表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    我们在中国期间，看到了多民族的中国人民在思想上和政治上的统一，像钢铁般地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东主席周围，为了光荣的祖国无穷无尽的繁荣进行斗争的情形，同时也看到了新中国在经济、文化建设各方面迅速发展和人民物质、文化生活水平日益提高的情况；并学习了生产革新者在建设斗争中所创造的宝贵经验。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在创造幸福的新生活的建设上所取得的巨大成就以及中国人民在建设事业中所表现的高度的劳动热情，大大地鼓舞了我们。我们衷心地祝贺中国人民在今后的建设事业上，获得更大的成就和胜利。
    三个多月来，我们在中国所见所闻的一切伟大的、庄严的事实，使我们留下了永远不可磨灭的印象。我们回国后，一定把我们所体验的一切事实详细地介绍给朝鲜人民，以进一步加强中、朝两国人民的友好团结，并鼓舞和动员投入恢复战后人民经济建设和为祖国的和平统一而奋斗的朝鲜人民的斗争意志。
    亲爱的朋友们！再见吧！今天我们虽然与你们分别了，但在正义的共同事业上，我们的心是互相密切地联系着的。为了中、朝两国经济及文化合作的进一步巩固和加强两国人民传统的友谊团结，为了保卫中、朝两国人民的自由，保卫亚洲的安全与世界持久和平，让我们手挽着手共同前进吧！
    朝鲜人民深信，以鲜血凝结成的中、朝两国人民国际主义的友谊团结的进一步巩固与发展，在达成我们的共同事业上将成为有力的保证。在以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营的支持下，中、朝两国人民的坚定不移的友好团结的力量，必将粉碎企图破坏我们正义事业的帝国主义者的任何阴谋活动。
    最后，当我们朝鲜人民访华代表团离开具有悠久历史的中国古都、中华人民共和国首都——北京的时候，我们衷心地祝贺：兄弟般的中国人民在为中国的繁荣、富强和保卫亚洲及世界和平的光荣的崇高的事业上获得新的胜利。
    中、朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各国人民战无不胜的国际主义友谊团结万岁！
