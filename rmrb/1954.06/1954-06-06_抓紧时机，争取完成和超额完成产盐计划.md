    Seize the Opportunity to Strive to Complete and Overfulfill the Salt Production Plan
  　Liu Jia
    Currently, the days are long and the weather is warm, the sunning time for salt production is long, and seawater evaporates quickly, making it a good season for salt production. The national salt production plan stipulates that by around July 15th, 90% of the annual plan should be produced. However, the current actual salt production is less than 40% of the annual plan. Therefore, whether 50% of the annual salt production plan can be completed in June and the first half of July is the key to whether the annual salt production plan can be completed and overfulfilled.
    This year, Party committees in various regions have strengthened their leadership over salt production; cadres in salt affairs work in various regions have gone deeper into their work than before; inspired by the general task of the country's transition period, salt workers have shown greater enthusiasm for production than before; this year, each salt field has seasonal and monthly production plans (which they did not have last year); preparations are more based on facts than last year and have been done better than last year; some advanced experiences have also been adopted and promoted. For these reasons, state-owned salt fields produced 39% more salt in the first four months of this year than in the same period last year. These achievements and progress should be affirmed.
    However, the national salt production in the first quarter and April of this year did not meet the state plan. Taking April as an example, state-owned salt fields only completed slightly over 93% of the monthly plan, and the production plan for the first quarter was completed even worse. The May plan was also not completed. Some people have questioned whether this year's salt production plan is set too high. But that is not the case. Because not all regions and salt fields across the country failed to complete their plans for the first four months of this year. For example, most salt fields in the Northeast and North China regions overfulfilled their April production plans. However, some salt fields in the Shandong region and all salt fields in the Huaibei region did not complete their production plans, especially the Huaibei region, which was even worse. What are the reasons for not completing the plan? Objectively, excessive rainfall in these areas since the beginning of spring has affected salt production. Subjectively, however, it is because the leaders of the enterprises are complacent, their work is mediocre, and they have not focused on preparing for the rain and taking remedial measures after the rain, given the heavy rainfall in these areas since the beginning of spring. This has not only affected production but also resulted in the loss of a large amount of formed salt. The Huaibei Salt Field completed its March plan very well, but its production situation deteriorated in April due to complacency and relaxation. This is a very serious lesson. Therefore, preventing and overcoming complacency and relaxation, and striving to complete and strive to over fulfill 50% of the annual salt production plan in June and the first half of July, is the current urgent task for all regions and salt fields.
    The biggest problem currently existing in salt production is the general lack of brine in salt fields across the country. Only with a steady supply of sufficient brine can the salt production plan be completed or overfulfilled. However, leaders in some regions or salt fields do not fully recognize this problem. They say: seawater is brine when it is drawn up, how can there be a shortage of brine? This is incorrect. They do not understand that many parts of our salt field structure are still unreasonable, the total storage capacity of water storage ponds is small, and the crystallization ponds are not fully utilized. To make full use of the current good season to increase salt production, all crystallization ponds must be fully utilized, which will inevitably lead to a situation where the supply of brine cannot meet the demand. This problem has already begun to emerge and cannot be ignored.
    Another problem is to adapt to the requirements of a large increase in salt production and strive to improve technical operations. Most of our salt fields have backward equipment and technical operations, and most salt workers lack scientific knowledge. They rely mainly on past experience and old operating methods for production and hold a skeptical attitude towards advanced experience and advanced operating methods. Therefore, salt field management cadres, especially cadres in grassroots management organizations, should personally study and master production technology to specifically lead and help salt workers implement and master advanced experience and improve technology.
    Third, we should strengthen the fight against natural disasters, especially against overcast and rainy weather. Last year, the work of preventing rain was not done well, and the country lost about one million dan of salt. This year, the work of preventing rain in the Huaibei region was not done well, and more than 200,000 dan of salt were lost. Currently, the Salt Affairs Bureau and the meteorological department have strengthened contact and strengthened weather forecasts for various regions and salt fields to help them strengthen prevention work. But the main thing is that various regions and salt fields should earnestly do a good job in the actual preparation for rain and disaster prevention, so as to minimize or avoid losses in salt production.
    At present, it is the tense season for salt production, the labor load of salt workers has increased, and work-related injuries and equipment damage accidents are most likely to occur. This requires leaders of salt fields to earnestly educate workers to pay attention to safety and try to ensure safety in order to carry out production normally.
    While increasing salt production, it is necessary to ensure that the quality of salt is not reduced. In the past, it was often the case that when production increased, attention was not paid to quality, or even quality was intentionally reduced, which is wrong. In places where well salt is produced, attention should also be paid to protecting the work of salt wells.

### 抓紧时机，争取完成和超额完成产盐计划

    抓紧时机，争取完成和超额完成产盐计划
  　刘甲
    目前昼长、天暖，晒盐时间长，海水蒸发快，正是产盐的好季节。全国产盐计划规定：到七月十五日左右止，要生产占全年计划百分之九十的盐。但目前实际产盐还不到全年计划的百分之四十。因此，六月份和七月上半月内能否完成全年产盐计划的百分之五十，是能否完成和超额完成全年产盐计划的关键。
    今年，各地党委加强了对盐业生产的领导；各地盐务工作干部的工作较前深入了一些；盐工们在国家过渡时期总任务的鼓舞下，生产积极性比以前更高了；今年各盐场都有了按季按月的生产计划（去年没有）；准备工作比去年更有依据，也做得比去年好；还采用和推广了一些先进经验。有了这些原因，今年一至四月份，国营盐场就比去年同期多产了百分之三十九的盐。这些成绩和进步都是应该肯定的。
    但是，全国今年第一季度和四月份盐的生产并没有完成国家计划。以四月份为例：国营盐场只完成月计划的百分之九十三强，第一季度生产计划完成得更差些。五月份计划也未完成。有人曾经怀疑过：今年的产盐计划是否订得过高了呢？事实并不是这样。因为并不是全国各地区各盐场都没有完成今年头四个月的计划。例如东北及华北区大多数盐场超额完成了四月份生产计划。而山东区部分盐场和淮北区各盐场就没有完成生产计划，尤其是淮北区更差些。没有完成计划的原因是什么呢？在客观方面，由于这些地区入春以来雨水过多，影响了产盐。在主观方面：却是由于企业的领导者有自满情绪，工作做得一般化，没有针对这些地区入春多雨的情况，着重做好雨前的准备工作和雨后的补救措施，这就既影响了生产，且损失了大量成盐。淮北盐场三月份计划完成很好，四月份因为自满而松劲，生产情况就很坏。这是很严重的教训。因此，防止和克服自满、松劲情绪，努力在六月份和七月上半月完成和争取超额完成全年产盐计划的百分之五十，这就是各地区各盐场当前的紧急任务。
    盐业生产中目前存在的最大问题，是各地盐场卤水普遍缺乏。而只有在源源供给充足的卤的情况下，才能够完成或超额完成产盐计划。但有些地区或一些盐场的领导人对这一问题还认识不足。他们说：海水引上来就是卤，那里能缺卤呢？这是不对的。他们不了解我们的盐田构造上还有很多地方不合理，储水池总量小，结晶池并未充分利用。要充分利用现在良好的季节来增加盐的产量，就必须充分利用所有结晶池，这必然会产生卤水供不应求的情况，目前这个问题已开始呈现，不可不予重视。
    另外一个问题是：要适应大量增产盐的要求，努力改进技术操作。我们的盐田大多是设备和技术操作落后，盐工们大都缺乏科学知识，他们从事生产多靠过去的经验和旧的操作方法，对先进经验和先进操作方法抱着怀疑态度，因此，盐场的管理干部特别是基层管理组织的干部，应该亲自钻研和掌握生产技术，以便具体领导和帮助盐工们推行和掌握先进经验，提高技术。
    第三、应加强与自然灾害的斗争，特别是对阴雨的斗争。去年防雨工作作得不好，全国损失了约一百万担盐，今年淮北区防雨工作作得不好，损失了二十多万担盐。目前，盐务总局与气象部门已经加强联系，加强对各地各盐场的气象预报，以帮助各地各盐场加强预防工作。但主要的是：各地各盐场应切实做好防雨防灾的实际准备工作，以求盐产少受或不受损失。
    目前正是盐业生产的紧张季节，盐工们的劳动负荷加重了，最容易发生工伤及设备损坏事故。这就要求各盐场领导上切实教育工人重视安全，并设法保障安全，才能正常地进行生产。
    在增加盐产量的同时，要保证不降低盐的质量。过去往往是产量一增加，便不注意质量，甚或有时有意降低质量，这是不对的。在生产井盐的地方同时还要注意保护盐井的工作。
