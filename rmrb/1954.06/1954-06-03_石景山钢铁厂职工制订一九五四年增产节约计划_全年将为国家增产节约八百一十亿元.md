Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers Formulate 1954 Production Increase and Savings Plan
Annual Production Increase and Savings for the State Will Total 81 Billion Yuan
    Following discussions on the 1954 national plan, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently formulated a plant-wide production increase and savings plan, aiming to achieve an annual production increase and savings of 81 billion yuan for the state.
    This year's national plan for the plant sets a production value target that is 9.18% higher than the actual production value completed last year. To exceed this plan, in addition to strengthening factory management and labor organization, it is necessary to address the following key issues: further implementing advanced Soviet experiences, launching a technical innovation movement, increasing equipment utilization rates, and improving operational methods. During the plan's discussion, workers generally examined the implementation of advanced Soviet experiences, using their brains, finding clever solutions, and proposing rationalization suggestions. The iron smelting department promoted four advanced experiences: "graded charging," "steam blowing," "furnace top regulation," and "raw material management." According to preliminary calculations, the "graded charging" alone could increase pig iron production by 1.8% annually and reduce coke ratio by 1.5%. The No. 2 hot blast furnace team, when discussing the hot blast temperature targets, first studied the advanced Soviet experience of "rapid combustion method," overcoming the past thinking of "the furnace is old and cannot burn quickly"; they also improved the equipment, increasing the hot blast temperature from 630 degrees to 680 degrees. Coal washing machine workers previously believed that "there are no rules for operating coal washing machines, it's just blind luck," so the production task for the first quarter of this year was not completed. During the discussion of the national plan, the Party branch summarized the work experience of coal washing worker Ren Jinghua, found a set of rational operating methods, significantly improved ash recovery rate, and overfulfilled the national production plan in May. The workers of No. 2 blast furnace put forward many rationalization proposals; eight of these proposals alone can save 58 labor units. Power department workers, in response to the issue of safe power supply, put forward 143 suggestions. Foundry workers proposed three technical measures such as mechanization of push tube work, which can save 340 labor units.
    After repeated deliberations and discussions, all the workers of the plant formulated the production increase and savings plan for 1954: an annual production increase of more than 25.4 billion yuan, a reduction in costs of more than 14.4 billion yuan, a saving in working capital of more than 32.2 billion yuan, and other savings of 9 billion yuan, totaling 81 billion yuan in annual production increase and savings.

    石景山钢铁厂职工制订一九五四年增产节约计划
    全年将为国家增产节约八百一十亿元
    石景山钢铁厂最近在讨论一九五四年国家计划以后，制订了全厂的增产节约计划，全年为国家增产节约八百一十亿元。
    该厂今年国家计划比去年实际完成的生产总值提高了百分之九点一八。要超额完成这个计划，除必须加强工厂管理、劳动组织以外，还要解决以下几个关键问题：进一步贯彻苏联先进经验，开展技术革新运动，提高设备利用率，改进操作方法。在讨论计划中，职工们普遍检查了贯彻苏联先进经验的情况，动脑筋、找窍门、提合理化建议。炼铁部推行“分级入炉”、“蒸气鼓风”、“炉顶调剂”、 “原料管理”等四项先进经验。据初步计算，仅 “分级入炉”一项，全年就可以多生产生铁百分之一点八；焦比可降低百分之一点五。二热风炉小组在讨论风温指标时，首先学习了苏联“快速燃烧法”先进经验，克服了过去“炉子老，不能快速燃烧”的思想；又改进了设备，使风温由六百三十度提高到六百八十度。洗煤机工人过去一向认为“洗煤机操作没有什么规律，就是瞎碰”，因此，今年第一季度的生产任务没有完成。在讨论国家计划时，党支部总结了洗煤工人任景华的工作经验，找出一套合理的操作方法，使灰分回收率显著提高，五月份超额完成了国家生产计划。二高炉职工提出了很多合理化建议；其中八项建议就可节省五十八个劳动力。动力部工人针对安全供电问题，提出了一百四十三项建议。铸造部工人提出了推管工作机械化等三项技术措施，可节省三百四十个劳动力。
    经过反复酝酿讨论，全厂职工制订出了一九五四年的增产节约计划：全年增产二百五十四亿余元，降低成本一百四十四亿余元，节约流动资金三百二十二亿余元，其他可节约九十亿元，总计全年增产节约八百一十亿元。
