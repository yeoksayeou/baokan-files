Xinhua News Agency, 19th: At the 32nd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Deng Xiaoping, member and secretary-general of the Central Election Committee, delivered a report on the completion of basic-level election work.

The report first pointed out that the nationwide basic-level election work was carried out entirely in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law. With the exception of a few areas where basic-level elections were temporarily not held, there were a total of 214,798 units conducting basic-level elections nationwide, covering a population of 571,434,511. In the election work, election committees at the township, county, city, and provincial levels were established in various places in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law. A total of 2,579,390 cadres were mobilized to participate in the guidance of the election work, and typical trials of basic-level elections were conducted in selected areas of different types to gain experience before launching them in batches. Now this widespread basic-level election movement has been successfully completed nationwide.

The report then stated that in the basic-level election work, various places first carried out population survey and registration work. Due to the adoption of practical and relatively scientific methods, and a series of meticulous work such as review, verification, supplementary registration and reporting, the population survey basically achieved the requirements of no duplication, no omission, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. According to preliminary statistics from the Central Population Survey and Registration Office, the total population of the country at 24:00 on June 30, 1953, was 601,912,371. Among them, 573,876,670 were the figures directly surveyed; 8,708,169 were the figures indirectly surveyed in ethnic minority areas where basic-level elections were not conducted; over 7 million were the estimated figures for Taiwan; and the rest were the figures for overseas Chinese. This is the first accurate population figure obtained through a comprehensive census in the history of our country. Through this survey, not only was a foundation laid for the progress of the election work, but also a reliable basis was provided for the country's planned construction.

Simultaneous with the population survey work, voter registration work was carried out in various places, and the issue of voter qualifications was correctly handled in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law. According to statistics from the Central Election Committee, in areas where basic-level elections were conducted nationwide, the result of voter qualification review showed that the total number of registered voters was 323,809,684, accounting for 97.18 percent of the total population over 18 years of age in the election areas. The number of people deprived of their right to vote according to law, plus mentally ill patients, accounted for only 1.64 percent of the total population in the election areas, and 2.82 percent of the total population over 18 years of age in the election areas. This demonstrates the universality and equality of our electoral system, and also proves that our people's democratic regime has an extremely broad mass base.

Judging from the election situation in various places, the broad masses of voters attached great importance to their democratic rights and enthusiastically participated in the elections. According to statistics from the Central Election Committee, 278,093,100 voters in the election areas nationwide participated in voting, accounting for 85.88 percent of the total number of registered voters. The proportion of women voters participating in the voting accounted for 84.01 percent of the total number of registered women voters. The people regarded the election date as a festival, decorating with lanterns and colors, and conducting the election solemnly and grandly. Jiang Baozhen, a young woman from Guozhuangzi, in the Fourth District of Tianjin, happened to be getting married during the election. In order to vote, she waited two hours before getting on the wedding car. She said: "Marriage is a major event, and election is even more important. Marriage is a happy event, and election is an even happier event." Pang Liangfang, a woman from Puzhen, Nanjing, could not attend the election meeting because she had just given birth to a child, so she named her child "Xuanyu" as a memento. Chen Cong, an overseas Chinese returning from Da Wan Township, Taishan County, Guangdong Province, excitedly said after attending the election meeting: "I have lived for more than ninety years and have been to many countries, but I have never seen such a democratic election."

In this basic-level election, a total of 5,669,144 representatives to the basic-level people's congresses were elected nationwide, of which women representatives accounted for 17.31 percent. The election results show that due to the in-depth education on the general task of the state's transition period during the election campaign, the political consciousness of the people has been raised, and "taking the road of socialism" has become the goal of struggle for the broad masses of the people. "Socialist leaders" have become the main criteria for selecting representatives under the choice of the masses. Many outstanding figures on the industrial and agricultural production fronts and in other fields have been elected as people's representatives. These outstanding figures are distributed in urban and rural areas and maintain close ties with the broad masses of the people, which is greatly conducive to the further consolidation of the people's democratic system.

The basic-level election work in various places has been closely integrated with the central work, and therefore has played a significant role in promoting various tasks. In the basic-level elections, many workers in factories and mines launched production competitions to greet and celebrate the elections, and completed their production plans ahead of schedule. After this election, the attendance rate on many construction sites was greatly improved. In terms of agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation, "Do a good job in production to welcome the general election" has become the action slogan of the broad masses. Many areas have developed mutual aid teams, consolidated and built new agricultural producers' cooperatives, and expanded and improved production during the election campaign. Some disaster areas started the general election by focusing on production and disaster relief, thereby solving the current living and production difficulties of the masses, and also successfully completed the election work.

The report pointed out that in the general election movement, democracy was fully promoted, and voters inspected the work of basic-level governments and the work style of cadres, so that all cadres were subjected to a profound democratic education under the appraisal of the masses, which played a positive role in supervising and promoting the improvement of work and the improvement of work style. Through inspection, the masses essentially realized that the vast majority of cadres were loyal, hardworking, and had done a lot of work for the people, so they elected them as representatives again this time. For some cadres whose work style was rigid and whose work had shortcomings, the masses pointed out their shortcomings, but also affirmed their achievements. After the cadres' sincere self-criticism, the masses understood and said: "People make mistakes, and horses slip," "Knowing mistakes and correcting them is not a mistake," and still elected them as representatives. In addition, some cadres were not elected as representatives because of their weak working ability and inability to play a leading role; and more importantly, in the basic-level elections, those who violated laws and discipline and committed serious commandism errors, and bad elements who occupied basic-level governments, were discovered and removed from the basic-level governments. This has further purified the organization of basic-level governments, strengthened the ties between the people's government and the people, and consolidated the unity of the people internally.

After the election, the work of the cadres became more active and they became more concerned about the production and life of the masses. They said: "In the past, being active was for liberation; now, being active is for arriving at a socialist society as soon as possible." In many backward villages, after the election, the people's political consciousness was raised, and the elected representatives actively led the masses, worked hard in production, and developed mutual aid and cooperation, so the entire township's work showed a new look. In the process of the election work, the general basic-level governments have reorganized their organizations and systems, adjusted their institutions, reduced levels, and the division of labor has become clearer, and the efficiency of the work has been greatly improved.

Regarding the elections in ethnic minority areas, the report pointed out that with the exception of some ethnic minority areas that did not conduct basic-level elections due to unmet conditions, basic-level elections were conducted in areas accounting for more than three-quarters of the national ethnic minority population. In addition, in conjunction with the election work, the national policy was further implemented in depth, and the unity among the various ethnic groups was strengthened. The basic-level election work in these areas mainly relied on local ethnic cadres and paid attention to consultation with representative figures of various ethnic groups, respecting the customs, habits, languages, and scripts of various ethnic groups. In this way, people of all ethnic groups felt more deeply from the elections that they were the masters of their own affairs, and further deeply realized that the People's Republic of China is a large family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups in our country.

The report finally said that this general election is a large-scale democratic movement, which has great historical significance in the political life of our people. The successful completion of the nationwide basic-level elections has greatly promoted the development of our country's people's democratic system and laid the foundation for people's congresses at the county level and above. On this basis, our country's first National People's Congress will be able to concentrate the will of the people of the whole country and realize its solemn mission. The people of all ethnic groups in the country will unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and strive to realize the general task of the state's transition period and ensure that our country is steadily built into a great socialist society.

    邓小平同志向中央人民政府委员会报告
    全国基层选举胜利完成
   【新华社十九日讯】在中央人民政府委员会第三十二次会议上，中央选举委员会委员兼秘书长邓小平作了基层选举工作完成情况的报告。
    报告首先指出：这次全国基层选举工作是完全按照选举法的规定进行的。除少数暂不进行基层选举的地区外，全国进行基层选举的单位共为二十一万四千七百九十八个，进行基层选举地区的人口共为五亿七千一百四十三万四千五百一十一人。在选举工作中，各地按照选举法的规定，建立了乡、县、市、省的各级选举委员会，动员了二百五十七万九千三百九十名干部参加选举的指导工作，并选择了不同类型的地区，进行了基层选举的典型试办，取得经验，然后分批展开。现在这个在全国范围内普遍展开的基层选举运动已经全部胜利完成了。
    报告接着说：在基层选举工作中，各地首先进行了人口调查登记工作。由于采取了切合实际的比较科学的办法，并作了复查核对和补登补报等一系列的细致工作，人口的调查基本上达到了不重复、不遗漏、全面、确实的要求。根据中央人口调查登记办公室的初步统计，一九五三年六月三十日二十四时的全国人口总数是六亿零一百九十一万二千三百七十一人。其中五亿七千三百八十七万六千六百七十人为直接调查的数字；八百七十万八千一百六十九人为没有进行基层选举的少数民族地区的间接调查的数字；七百余万人为台湾的估计数字；其余为国外华侨的数字。这是我国有史以来第一次经过全面的普查所得到的准确的人口数字。通过这次调查，不仅为选举工作的进行打下了基础，而且也为国家的计划建设提供了可靠的根据。
    和人口调查工作进行的同时，各地进行了选民登记的工作，按照选举法的规定，正确地处理了选民资格的问题。根据中央选举委员会的统计，在全国进行基层选举的地区，选民资格审查的结果，登记选民总数为三亿二千三百八十万九千六百八十四人，占进行选举地区十八周岁以上人口总数的百分之九七点一八。而全国依法被剥夺选举权利的人并加上精神病患者，只占进行选举地区人口总数的百分之一点六四，占进行选举地区十八周岁以上人口总数的百分之二点八二。这说明了我们选举制度的普遍性和平等性，也证明了我国人民民主政权具有极为广泛的群众基础。
    从各地选举的情况来看，广大选民都十分重视自己的民主权利，热烈地参加了选举。根据中央选举委员会的统计，全国进行选举地区的选民，参加投票的有二亿七千八百零九万三千一百人，占登记的选民总数的百分之八五点八八。选民中妇女参加投票的占登记的妇女选民总数的百分之八四点零一。人民把选举的日期当作节日，张灯结彩，庄严隆重地进行选举。天津市四区郭庄子青年妇女蒋宝珍，结婚时正赶上选举，她为了投票，等了两个钟头才上花车，她说：“结婚是大事，选举更是大事，结婚是喜事，选举更是喜事。”南京市浦镇妇女庞良芳，生了小孩子不能参加选举大会，就把孩子起名
  “选玉”作为纪念。广东省台山县大湾乡归国华侨陈聪，参加选举大会后兴奋地说：“我活了九十多岁，到过许多国家，从来没有见过这样民主的选举。”
    在这次基层选举中，全国各地共选出五百六十六万九千一百四十四名基层人民代表大会的代表，其中妇女代表占百分之一七点三一。选举结果表明：由于在选举运动中深入地进行了国家过渡时期总任务的教育，人民群众的政治觉悟提高了，“走社会主义的路”成为广大人民群众奋斗的目标，“社会主义带路人”成为挑选代表的主要标准。在群众的选择下，很多工业和农业生产战线上以及其他各方面的优秀人物被选为人民代表。这些优秀人物分布在城市和乡村中，和广大人民群众保持着密切的联系，这就大大有利于人民民主制度的进一步的巩固。
    各地的基层选举工作都是密切结合着中心工作进行的，因此对于各项工作也起了重大的推动作用。在基层选举中，许多厂矿企业的工人为了迎接和庆祝选举，掀起了生产竞赛，提前完成了生产计划。许多工地经过这次选举，出勤率大大提高了。在农业生产和互助合作方面，“搞好生产迎接普选”成为广大群众的行动口号。很多地区在选举运动中发展了互助组，整顿和新建了农业生产合作社，扩大和提高了生产。有些灾区从生产救灾入手进行普选，从而解决了群众当前生活上和生产上的困难，也顺利地完成了选举工作。
    报告指出：在普选运动中，充分地发扬了民主，选民们检查了基层政权的工作和干部的工作作风，使所有干部在群众鉴别下，受到了一次深刻的民主教育，对于改进工作，改善作风，起了积极的监督和推动作用。群众通过检查，从本质上认识到绝大多数干部都是忠心耿耿、任劳任怨的，为人民作了许多工作，因而这次又选举他们当了代表。对于一部分作风生硬、工作有缺点的干部，群众指出了他们的缺点，也肯定了他们的成绩，再经过干部诚恳的自我检讨，群众谅解说：“人有失脚，马有漏蹄”，
  “知过改过不算过”，仍然选举他们作了代表。此外，也有一部分干部由于工作能力不强，不能起领导作用，没有被选为代表；而更重要的是在基层选举中，把那些违法乱纪犯有严重命令主义错误的分子和窃踞在基层政权中的坏分子发现出来，并从基层政权中剔除了出去。这就更加纯洁了基层政权的组织，密切了人民政府与人民群众的联系，巩固了人民内部的团结。
    经过选举，干部的工作更加积极了，更加关心群众的生产和生活，他们说：过去积极是为了翻身；现在积极，为了早到社会主义社会。不少工作落后的乡村，经过选举，人民的政治觉悟提高了，当选的代表积极领导群众，努力生产，发展互助合作，因而全乡工作出现了新气象。在选举工作过程中，一般基层政权都整顿了组织和制度，调整了机构，减少了层次，分工更加明确了，工作效能有了很大的提高。
    关于少数民族地区的选举，报告指出，除部分少数民族地区由于条件未具备没有进行基层选举外，占全国少数民族人口四分之三以上的地区都进行了基层选举，并且都结合选举工作，进一步深入地贯彻了民族政策，加强了各民族之间的团结。这些地区的基层选举工作主要是依靠当地的民族干部，并注意和各民族代表性人物协商，尊重各民族的风俗习惯和语言文字。这样，各族人民从选举中便更深刻地感到自己在当家作主，并进一步深切体会到中华人民共和国是我国各族人民友好合作的大家庭。
    报告最后说：这次普选是一个规模巨大的民主运动，它在我国人民政治生活中具有重大的历史意义。全国基层选举的胜利完成，大大推动了我国人民民主制度的发展，并为县以上各级人民代表大会奠定了基础。在此基础上，我国的第一次全国人民代表大会将能够集中全国人民的意志，实现其庄严的使命。全国各族人民将更加紧密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的周围，为实现国家过渡时期的总任务，为保证我国稳步地建设成为伟大的社会主义社会而奋斗。
