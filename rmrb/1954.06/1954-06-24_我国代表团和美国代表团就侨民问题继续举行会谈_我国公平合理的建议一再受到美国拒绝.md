Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 21st: The delegations of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America attending the Geneva Conference held their fourth meeting on the 21st on the issue of nationals of both countries and Chinese students in the United States. Participating in this meeting were Wang Bingnan and Ke Bonian from the Chinese side, and Johnson and Martin from the American side.

During this meeting, the Chinese representative suggested that both parties draft a joint communiqué announcing that law-abiding nationals and students residing in each other's country would have complete freedom to return to their homeland. Subsequently, the Chinese representative also suggested that a third country manage the rights and interests of nationals and students of both sides on the basis of mutual equality. However, because the United States was unwilling to stop detaining Chinese nationals and students, the American representative expressed disagreement with all these proposals.

The Chinese representative, Wang Bingnan, explained the preliminary results of the investigation into the list of Americans in China submitted by the American representative on June 10, and pointed out that two of them had already been granted permission to leave the country and had already departed from China.

The American representative, Johnson, said in his speech that out of more than 5,000 Chinese students, only 120 had applied to leave the United States and return to China. Moreover, he said that half of these 120 had withdrawn their applications, and that of the other half, fifteen would be approved to leave the country, while the others would remain under "review." Everyone knows that the reason why many Chinese students are afraid to apply to return to China is precisely because the US government has adopted means of oppression and intimidation against them. The US government has notified them that they must not leave the United States, and has threatened them that if they violate this order of the US government, they will be sentenced to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to five years, or both. According to information already received, Chinese students who have applied to return to China have recently been interrogated by the US Immigration Bureau, some for as long as two hours, and are not allowed to have their lawyers present. All of this has increased the concerns of Chinese students who are eager to return to their homeland, making them afraid to request to return to China. Obviously, if the US government removes these means of oppression and intimidation, there would be far more Chinese students requesting to return to their homeland than are currently applying.

In order to affirm the rights that law-abiding nationals and Chinese students in the United States should have and to reassure them, the Chinese representative, Wang Bingnan, suggested that the two sides draft the following joint communiqué:

"The delegations of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America attending the Geneva Conference have held discussions in Geneva on the issue of nationals and students, and both sides will respect the right of law-abiding nationals and students of the other party residing in their respective countries to leave the country and return home. These nationals and students shall have the freedom to return to their homeland at any time."

However, the American representative, Johnson, unreasonably expressed disagreement with this suggestion. Johnson said that the American side would issue a separate statement affirming that Chinese nationals would have "complete freedom to go wherever they want in accordance with US laws and regulations." However, at the same time, he was unwilling to issue a joint communiqué to affirm this point. As for whether the United States is actually prepared to fulfill their promise with action, it remains to be seen by future facts. Wang Bingnan then suggested that this be recorded as a common record as a common understanding between the two sides on this issue. But Johnson also refused to agree.

In order to seek a mutually acceptable solution to fairly and reasonably resolve this issue, Wang Bingnan suggested that the envoys of a third country stationed in both countries manage the interests of nationals and students of both countries. Wang Bingnan pointed out that the US side had requested the negotiating representative of the United Kingdom stationed in Beijing in 1950 to manage the interests of American nationals in China. Due to the circumstances at the time, it was not possible for the Chinese People's Government to consider this issue. Now that the situation has changed, the Chinese People's Government believes that such measures can be considered on a mutual and equal basis. The United States can ask an envoy of a third country that has diplomatic relations with both parties stationed in China to manage the interests of American nationals in China, and similarly, China can ask an envoy of a third country that has diplomatic relations with both parties stationed in the United States to manage the interests of Chinese nationals and students in the United States. Wang Bingnan also said that if both parties agree to adopt this measure in accordance with the principle of mutuality and equality, it would be beneficial to the nationals and students of both sides.

However, Johnson was unwilling to enter into discussion on this fair and reasonable proposal.

The attitude of the American representative makes one wonder: Will the US side truly stop detaining Chinese nationals and students? It also makes one wonder: Is the US government truly concerned about their nationals?

### 我国代表团和美国代表团就侨民问题继续举行会谈  我国公平合理的建议一再受到美国拒绝

    我国代表团和美国代表团就侨民问题继续举行会谈
    我国公平合理的建议一再受到美国拒绝
    【新华社日内瓦二十一日电】出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团和美国代表团于二十一日就两国侨民和留美中国学生问题进行第四次会谈。参加这一会谈的，中国方面有王炳南、柯柏年；美国方面有约翰逊和马丁。
    在这次会谈中，中国代表建议由双方起草联合公报，宣布住在一方的对方的守法侨民和留学生将具有返回祖国的完全自由。随后中国代表又建议在相互平等的基础上由第三国代管双方侨民和留学生的权益，但是由于美国方面不愿停止扣留中国侨民和留学生，美国代表对所有这些建议都先后表示不予同意。
    中国代表王炳南对美国代表在六月十日所交来的在中国的美国人的名单说明了初步调查结果，并指出其中二人已获得出境许可，并已启程离开中国。
    美国代表约翰逊在他的发言中说，在五千多名中国留学生中，只有一百二十人要求离美返国，而且据他说，在这一百二十人中有一半已经撤销申请，在另一半的留学生里面有十五人将予批准离境，其他人则仍将“审查”。大家知道，许多中国留学生之所以不敢申请回国，正是由于美国政府对他们采取了压迫和威胁的手段。美国政府通知他们不得离开美国，并威胁他们说，如果违反了美国政府这一命令，将被判处五千美元以下的罚金或者五年以下的徒刑，或者同时予以两种处分。根据已经得到的消息，已经申请回国的中国留学生最近又受到美国移民局的讯问，这种讯问甚至长达两个小时，并且不许申请者的律师到场。所有这些都增加了渴望返回祖国的中国留学生的疑虑，使他们不敢要求回国。显然，如果美国政府撤销了这种压迫和威胁的手段，就会有远远超过目前申请返国者数目的中国留学生要求返回祖国。
    为了肯定两国守法侨民和留美中国学生得以行使他们所应有的权利并使他们放心，中国代表王炳南建议双方起草下述的联合公报。
    “出席日内瓦会议的中华人民共和国代表团和美利坚合众国代表团在日内瓦举行关于侨民和留学生问题的接触，双方都对于住在各该国内的对方的守法侨民和留学生的离境回国的权利将予尊重。这些侨民和留学生应有随时返回祖国的自由。”
    然而美国代表约翰逊却毫无理由地表示不同意这一建议。约翰逊说，美国方面将单独发表声明，肯定中国侨民“依照美国的法律和规章，有完全自由到他们所愿意去的任何地方”。可是同时他又不愿意发表一个联合公报来肯定这一点。至于美国方面究竟是否准备以行动来实现他们的诺言，有待于今后事实的证明。王炳南接着又建议把这一点作为共同记录，以作为双方关于这一问题的共同谅解。但是约翰逊同样也表示不予同意。
    为了谋求双方都能接受的办法来公平合理地解决这一问题，王炳南又建议由第三国驻两国使节代管两国侨民和留学生的利益。王炳南指出美方在一九五○年曾经请联合王国驻北京的谈判代表代管在中国的美国侨民的利益。由于当时的情况，使得中国人民政府没有可能来考虑这一问题。现在情况既已有所改变，中国人民政府认为在相互的、平等的基础上，这样的措施是可以考虑的。美国可请一个和双方有外交关系的第三国驻中国使节代管美国在中国的侨民的利益，同样地中国也可请一个和双方有外交关系的第三国驻美使节代管在美国的中国侨民和留学生的利益。王炳南又说，如果双方同意采取这一符合相互的、平等的原则的措施，对于双方侨民和留学生都是有好处的。
    但是约翰逊也不愿就这一公平合理的建议进入讨论。
    美国代表的这种态度使人怀疑：美国方面是否会真正停止扣留中国侨民和留学生？也使人怀疑：美国政府是否真正关心他们的侨民？
