Xinhua News Agency, London, June 24th (TASS): During the debate on various foreign policy issues in the British House of Commons on June 23rd, all speakers acknowledged the necessity of resolving international disputes through peaceful means and ensuring that the People's Republic of China receives the major power status it deserves in the international family. During the debate, many speakers praised the efforts of Soviet Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov to achieve success at the Geneva Conference. At the same time, speakers criticized the policies of the United States.

According to the official parliamentary report, Conservative MP Robert Boothby criticized the American position at the Geneva Conference, particularly that of Dulles. Boothby said that Dulles "walked away at the beginning of the conference, which indicates that he did not approve of the entire conference." Boothby continued: "Frankly, American policy has not been very constructive in recent weeks. I can also point out that the Americans initially expressed opposition to any negotiations. In fact, they are not satisfied with the Geneva Conference. Things like this make people doubt whether the Americans really want any peaceful solution. I think the House should express such doubts."

Turning to Europe, Boothby pointed out that the Americans were putting great pressure on the French government to formulate a draft of a "European Defense Community" treaty.

Boothby then spoke on the German issue, saying: "I personally believe that the unification of Germany is best resolved through an agreement between the Western world and the communist world."

Labour MP Woodrow Wyatt emphasized in his speech that the Ho Chi Minh government enjoys the support of public opinion in Vietnam. He said: "At the Geneva Conference, one factor was clearer than anything else, and that is that whether the Americans like it or not, China has now stepped onto the world stage, and any future negotiations on Asian issues cannot be conducted without its participation."

Labor MP Harold Davies said that Churchill and Eden should first do in Washington is: "Insist on China's entry into the Security Council, regardless of whether American officials are happy about it. The American people understand the realities of the situation."

Davies pointed out the responsibility of the United States for launching the Korean War and declared that he did not want to see Britons die because of the conclusion of the so-called Southeast Asia Security Pact, which aims to support notorious figures like Syngman Rhee and Bao Dai.

    英国下院二十三日进行外交政策问题辩论时
    发言的议员赞成用和平方式解决国际分歧
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十四日讯：六月二十三日在英国下院进行外交政策各项问题的辩论时，所有发言人都承认，必须用和平方式解决国际分歧，必须使中华人民共和国得到它在国际大家庭中所应有的大国地位。在辩论时，许多发言的人都赞扬苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫为谋求日内瓦会议成功所做的各种努力。同时，发言人都抨击了美国的政策。
    根据正式议会报告书记载，保守党议员罗伯特·布斯比抨击了美国在日内瓦会议上的立场，特别是杜勒斯的立场。布斯比说，杜勒斯“在会议开始的时候就走掉，这表示他对整个会议是不赞同的”。布斯比继续说道：“老实说，美国政策在最近几周来是没有很大的建设性的。我还可以指出一点，美国人一开始就表示反对任何谈判。实际上，他们是不满意日内瓦会议的。类似这样一些事情就使人们怀疑美国人是不是真的要求任何和平解决。我认为下院应当表示这样一些怀疑。”
    布斯比转而谈到欧洲时指出，美国人对法国政府施加了很大的压力，力求制订出一个“欧洲防务集团”条约的草案。
    布斯比接着谈到德国问题时说：“我个人认为，德国的统一最好是靠西方世界和共产主义世界之间取得协议的方法来解决”。
    工党议员伍德罗·怀阿特在发言中强调说，胡志明政府在越南享有社会舆论的支持。他说：“在日内瓦会议上，有一个因素比一切都表现得更清楚，那就是不管美国人愿意与否，中国现已走上了世界舞台，今后关于亚洲问题的任何谈判没有它的参加就不能进行”。
    工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯说，邱吉尔和艾登在华盛顿首先要做的应该是：“力主让中国进入安全理事会，而不问美国的官员们对这点是否高兴。美国人民是了解事情的现实情况的”。
    戴维斯指出了美国对发动朝鲜战争所负的责任，并声明说，他不愿看到英国人由于缔结了目的在支持像李承晚和保大这样声名狼藉的人的所谓东南亚安全公约而死亡。
