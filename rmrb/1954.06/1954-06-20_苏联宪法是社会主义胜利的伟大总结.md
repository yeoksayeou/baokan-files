The Soviet Constitution is the fundamental law of a victorious socialist country. It truly reflects the will of the entire Soviet people under the conditions of the dictatorship of the working class, legally fixes the basic principles of the socialist social system and state system that have been won, and becomes the legal basis for the current legislation of the Soviet state.

The current Soviet Constitution was adopted on December 5, 1936, by the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union. This constitution marks the complete and thorough victory of the socialist system and socialist democracy in the Soviet Union. It is a milestone in the Soviet Union's entry into a new historical period of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning to a communist society.

The new Soviet Constitution (hereinafter, "new Soviet Constitution" refers to the one adopted in 1936) was adopted after national discussion, which alone demonstrates its democratic nature. Before the constitution was formally adopted, the Soviet people participated in the nationwide discussion of the draft constitution with great enthusiasm, actively, and conscientiously. The discussion lasted for more than five months. A total of 458,441 meetings of various laborers, 100,572 meetings of Soviet representative groups, and 59,171 meetings of Soviets at all levels and their executive committees were held, with a total of more than 51.5 million people participating in these meetings. The total number of suggestions and supplements to the draft constitution proposed by the workers exceeded 1.5 million. These figures vividly and powerfully prove that the new Soviet Constitution "was not conceived by any committee, it was not drafted by lawyers, nor was it copied from any other constitution" (Lenin), but was personally drafted by the entire Soviet people who had been liberated and completely freed from the system of exploitation. The working people used this constitution to record their experience in the struggle and organization against the exploiters, and legally fixed the fruits of the socialist victory that had been achieved.

The new Soviet Constitution records in concise terms that the socialist system has become a living reality in the Soviet Union. In the first Soviet Constitution (the Constitution of the Russian Soviet Republic), adopted in July 1918, it was clearly stipulated that the basic tasks of the Soviet state were to relentlessly suppress the resistance of the exploiting classes, eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man, and establish a socialist social system. Under the banner of the first constitution to strive for socialist victory, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the working class and all working people smashed the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, defeated the joint offensive of landlords, capitalists, and foreign imperialists; and, in accordance with the New Economic Policy formulated by Lenin, realized the socialist industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, finally making the socialist public ownership the only unshakable economic foundation of Soviet society. By 1935, 96 percent of the means of production had been controlled by the state, collective farms, and cooperatives, capitalist elements had been completely eliminated, and the individual peasant economy had been pushed to a secondary position. Thus, as Stalin pointed out: "Facts show that we have built the foundation of a socialist society in the Soviet Union, and all we have to do now is to build the superstructure on this foundation..." The promulgation of the new Soviet Constitution was the concrete implementation of Stalin's instruction. The new Soviet Constitution legally fixed the socialist economy as the dominant economic form in the Soviet Union. The constitution clearly stipulates: "The economic foundation of the U.S.S.R. is the socialist system of economy and the socialist ownership of the instruments and means of production, firmly established as a result of the liquidation, of the capitalist system of economy, the abolition of private ownership of the instruments and means of production, and the abolition of exploitation of man by man." (Article 4) The constitution points out that public ownership and cooperative collective farm ownership are the two forms of socialist ownership, and public ownership is the highest leading form. At the same time, the constitution recognizes and guarantees citizens' personal ownership and inheritance rights to consumer goods, and allows and protects the small private economy of individual peasants and handicraftsmen who engage in self-reliant business and never exploit the labor of others. The socialist ownership of the means of production fixed by the constitution is the foundation of socialist relations of production, which determines the new type of relationship of comradely cooperation and socialist mutual assistance among people in the production process, opens up broad avenues for the development of social productive forces, and provides full possibilities for the economic law of planned and proportional development of the national economy and the basic economic law of socialism to play their role. Article 11 of the Constitution states very clearly: "The economic life of the U.S.S.R. is determined by and guided by the state national economic plan, with the object of increasing the public wealth, of steadily raising the material and cultural standards of the working people, of consolidating the independence of the
  U.S.S.R. and strengthening its defensive capacity." While fixing the socialist public ownership economy, the new Soviet Constitution also affirms the socialist principles of labor and distribution. As early as the 1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Republic, it was stipulated: "In order to eliminate the parasitic classes in society and organize the economy, universal labor conscription is implemented"; "Labor is recognized as the duty of all citizens of the Republic
  and the following slogan is announced: ‘He who does not work, neither shall he eat!’". In the new Soviet Constitution, it is further clearly stipulated: "In accordance with the principle of ‘He who does not work, neither shall he eat,’ work is the duty and a matter of honor for every able-bodied citizen of the U.S.S.R. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his work' the socialist principle is implemented." This shows that the socialist
  society is built on the basis of labor. Under the condition that the principle of "to each according to his needs" cannot be implemented due to the limitations of the level of development of the productive forces, the principle of "distribution according to work" can promote workers to actively improve labor productivity, and educate them to correctly combine personal interests with social interests, and seek the maximum satisfaction of their growing material and cultural needs on the basis of the continuous increase of social wealth. Real life has repeatedly and eloquently proved that the socialist economic system fixed by the new Soviet Constitution will never know what crises and unemployment are, what poverty and bankruptcy are, but will enable all members of society to have every possibility to enjoy an abundant material life and cultural life. Under the socialist system, all exploiting classes have been eliminated, and the entire society is composed of working people, that is, the working class, the peasantry, and the working intellectuals. Article 1 of the Constitution openly declares: "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of workers and peasants." It undisguisedly reveals the class essence of the Soviet state and clearly stipulates the state system of the Soviet Union, which is a state of the dictatorship of the working class based on a solid and lasting alliance of workers and peasants. Not only have all workers, peasants, and intellectuals been completely renewed, but their interests have become consistent with each other, and their class boundaries and essential differences are also gradually disappearing. Thus, as Stalin pointed out: "On the basis of this commonality, there is also the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union, and Soviet patriotism." Only in this way is it perfectly natural and completely understandable that the Soviet Constitution fixes the exclusive leading position of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Soviet society. Article 126 of the new Soviet Constitution writes directly: "...The most active and conscious citizens in the ranks of the working class and other sections of the working people unite in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the vanguard in the struggle of the working people for the construction of communist society and representing the guiding core of all organisations of the working people, both public and state." In Soviet society, there is no basis for the existence of several political parties, and the Communist Party is the leading force of the Soviet state; the leadership of the Party has been, is, and will continue to be the decisive fundamental guarantee for all victories of the Soviet state. The great significance of the above provisions of the Constitution lies precisely in this.

The new Soviet Constitution adapts to the new economic relations and class relations of Soviet society and fixes the basic principles of the socialist state system, which has been further democratized. The constitution confirms that all state power belongs to all urban and rural working people, and stipulates that the form of exercising state power is the Soviets of Working People's Deputies, which is also the political foundation of the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, according to the first Soviet Constitution and the 1924 Soviet Constitution, the Soviet regime established after the overthrow of the landlord-capitalist regime took the name of the Soviets of Workers', Peasants', and Red Army Deputies; adapting to the domestic political, economic, and cultural situation at that time, it implemented a restricted (depriving the exploiters and other reactionary elements of the right to vote), incompletely equal (workers' representatives outnumbered peasants' representatives), indirect (intermediate and higher Soviets of Deputies other than city and village Soviets), and open ballot election system; the legislative power was exercised separately by several state organs (All-Russian or All-Soviet Congress of Deputies, the Central Executive Committee and its Presidium, and the People's Committee). All these and other similar provisions indicate the transitional nature of the Soviet state's political and legal systems at that time, and also correctly reflect the will of the vast majority of working people who first grasped state power, effectively guaranteeing their right to be masters of their own affairs, and thereby greatly consolidating the young Soviet regime. Now, according to the new Soviet Constitution, the Soviets of Working People's Deputies at all levels—from the Supreme Soviet to the village Soviet—uniformly implement the most democratic election system of universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot, and correspondingly, the organizational system of the central and local organs of state power has been thoroughly reorganized according to the principle of democratic centralism.

According to the provisions of the new Soviet Constitution, the Soviet state organs are a unified and complete and most democratic state organ that organically combines legislative power and administrative power.

The Supreme Soviet and the local Soviets at all levels are representative organs of the Soviet Union, and they are regularly directly elected by Soviet citizens, with broad representation and democratic nature. For example, among the 1,347 representatives newly elected to the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, there are 318 worker representatives, 220 farmer representatives, and 809 Soviet intellectual representatives. The representatives of the Supreme Soviet and the local Soviets are servants of the people. They must work in accordance with the instructions of the voters, accept the direct supervision of the voters, and maintain constant and close contact with the voters, and the voters have the right to recall individual incompetent representatives ahead of time. This democratic principle regarding the relationship between Soviet representatives and voters has been legislatively confirmed in the new Soviet Constitution. Article 142 of the Constitution clearly states: "Every deputy must report to the voters on the work of himself and the Soviet of Working People's Deputies, and may be recalled at any time by a majority decision of the voters in accordance with legal procedures." According to the new Soviet Constitution, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest organ of state power in the Soviet Union, and it concentrates the legislative power of the entire Union in its own hands and becomes the sole legislative organ of the Soviet Union. In this way, the new Soviet Constitution makes the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union occupy the primary position in the Soviet state organ system, playing a role similar to that of an engine; the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union directly, as the fully empowered representative of the sovereign will of the Soviet people, decides major issues in all aspects of legislation, internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, and economy of the entire Soviet Union, elects, organizes, and appoints other supreme state organs, and leads and supervises their work. The new Soviet Constitution gives the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union such great power and superior position, which is a clear manifestation of the working people being in power and in charge of state affairs.

The local Soviets established on the basis of the principles of the new Soviet Constitution are the local state power organs of the Soviet Union. In order to ensure the unity of government decrees, the local Soviets at all levels do not enjoy legislative power, but within their respective jurisdictions (provinces, cities, districts, and villages), they are representatives of the sovereign will of the people, and all major economic and cultural construction matters in the locality are decided by them. The other state organs in the locality (except for the procuratorial organs) are produced by them and are led and supervised by them. The local Soviets enjoy full independence under the centralized leadership of the central government, and have every possibility to give play to local initiative and pioneering spirit. The new Soviet Constitution completely follows Lenin's famous instructions in resolving the issue of the relationship between the central government and the local governments: "Centralism, understood in the true democratic sense, presupposes the possibility, created for the first time in history, of a full and unhampered development not only of specific local features, but also of local inventiveness, local initiative, of diverse ways, methods and means of progress to the common goal."

From the point of view of facilitating the guarantee of the Supreme State Power organ to realize the regular leadership and supervision of the State Administration organ (that is, the administrative organ), as well as the exercise of some regular functions of the Supreme State Power, the new Soviet Constitution stipulates that during the adjournment of the Supreme Soviet, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet composed of 33 members elected by the Supreme Soviet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is a permanent organ of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and is the collective president of the Soviet Union. It demonstrates a truly democratic characteristic with strict collective leadership and collective responsibility principles and subordination to the supreme representative organ.

While stipulating the system of state power organs, the new Soviet Constitution also stipulates the system of state management organs established on the basis of the principle of democratic centralism. In the central government, the Council of Ministers is organized by the Supreme Soviet at its joint meeting of the two chambers as the government of the Soviet Union, that is, the highest state management organ, and unifies the management activities in all aspects of the state (internal affairs, diplomacy, national defense, industry, agriculture, etc.) in accordance with the laws passed by the Supreme Soviet and the orders of the Presidium. In the localities, the local state management organs—executive committees—are elected by the local Soviets at all levels to be responsible for leading local economic and cultural construction. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the state management organs of the Soviet Union carry out work under the supervision of the representative organs, and they are responsible to and report to the representative organs or their permanent organs. At the same time, in order to guarantee unified leadership and adapt to local conditions, and to give play to the initiative of the state management organs, especially the local state management organs, the Constitution stipulates that the democratic principle of dual leadership is implemented in the state management organ system. For example, Article 101 of the Constitution stipulates that the executive organs of the local Soviets (including the executive committees and their subordinate work departments) directly report to the local Soviets at the same level and the executive organs of the local Soviets at the higher level. This provision is completely based on Lenin's following instructions, namely: "In those places where it is necessary to be good at estimating that there are truly unavoidable differences, 'dual' subordination is necessary. The agriculture of Kaluga Province is obviously different from the agriculture of Kazan Province. ...The same is true for the entire administrative aspect or management organ. In all such issues, if the local characteristics are not estimated, one will fall into bureaucratic centralism, etc., and it will hinder the local staff from estimating local differences, which estimation is the basis of rational work."

Soviet state activities are not only manifested in legislation and management (administration), but also in trial and legal supervision. For this reason, the new Soviet Constitution also stipulates the system of state judicial organs headed by the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, which are elected by and responsible to the corresponding Soviets of Working People's Deputies (the people's courts are directly elected by the voters, but they are the basic link in the unified Soviet judicial organ system), so as to independently exercise judicial power. The judicial organs fixed by the new Soviet Constitution are powerful weapons for realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat and suppressing the enemies of the people, and are effective tools for educating the working masses to abide by laws and discipline. At the same time, the Soviet Constitution also stipulates the system of procuratorial organs headed by the Procurator General of the Soviet Union, which are established on the basis of the principle of vertical leadership and personal responsibility and are generated according to the appointment procedure and are subordinate to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. They are responsible for supervising the strict compliance of the state departments of the central government, local organs, judicial organs, public officials, and Soviet citizens with the law, so as to ensure the unified understanding and application of the socialist legal system throughout the Soviet Union.
      In this way, the new Soviet Constitution comprehensively confirms the unified and complete system of state organs by means of legislative procedures, and powerfully guarantees all state organs from the strict organizational system aspect. Under the participation, promotion, and supervision of the working masses, like a dexterous machine, it actively plays its due role in consolidating and developing socialist relations of production, and for the victorious realization of the task of gradually transitioning to communism.
      It must also be emphasized that the new Soviet Constitution correctly adjusted domestic ethnic relations with the great principles of internationalism and realized the sincere unity of all ethnic groups. Article 123 of the Constitution clearly stipulates:
  "Citizens of the U.S.S.R. have equality of rights, irrespective of nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life. Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of citizens or, conversely, any establishment or privileges on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law." Starting from this general principle, the Constitution stipulates on the one hand that the great socialist federation—the Soviet Union—is formed by sixteen union republics enjoying state sovereignty in accordance with the principles of equality and voluntariness; on the other hand, it stipulates that according to the different development conditions and characteristics of the minority ethnic groups living in certain union republics, sixteen autonomous republics, nine autonomous provinces, and ten ethnic regions are respectively established as different organizational forms of national regional autonomy enjoying autonomous rights in certain union republics. In order to better guarantee the equal rights of workers of all ethnic groups in state management and guarantee the harmonious unity of their common and special interests, the Constitution stipulates: the establishment of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union composed of two chambers (the Union Chamber and the Nationality Chamber) and the Soviet state management organs of all union and union-republic levels; the laws of the Supreme Soviet are published in the languages of all ethnic groups; the number of vice-chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet is equal to the number of union republics; in the state organs and schools of various ethnic republics and other national autonomous units, the languages of the ethnic groups are used, and the cadres of the ethnic groups participate in the work; in litigation, it is guaranteed that the parties use their ethnic languages to make statements in court, and so on. It is precisely through all the basic principles and implementation specific methods of the national policies fixed and further developed by the new Soviet Constitution that the Soviet ethnic groups have embarked on the road of unity and cooperation. With the selfless assistance of the Russian ethnic group, the minority ethnic groups in all border areas have been able to overcome the economic and cultural backwardness left over from history, rise to the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and jointly build a socialist society.
      Finally, the new Soviet Constitution also systematically and comprehensively stipulates the basic rights and obligations of Soviet citizens in a special chapter, which more vividly embodies the spirit of thorough socialist democracy. Compared with the 1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Republic, the new Constitution first expanded the scope of rights and freedoms. It not only stipulated democratic freedoms such as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, parade, demonstration, and freedom of religious belief, but also further stipulated the right to work, the right to rest, the right to material security in old age, sickness, and loss of working ability, and the most important socio-economic and cultural rights such as the right to education; second, it further expanded the material guarantee for the realization of these rights; third, it abolished the restrictions and differences in rights and realized complete equality in rights. As Stalin pointed out when talking about the characteristics of the new constitution: "It does not recognize the differences in rights between men and women, 'long-term residents' and 'temporary residents,' property owners and non-property owners, educated people and uneducated people, but considers that all citizens have equal rights. What determines the status of each citizen in society is not the property status, not the ethnic origin, not the gender, not the position, but each person's ability and each person's labor." All this is the inevitable result of the thorough elimination of the exploitation system and the comprehensive victory of the socialist system, and it is also one of the obvious signs of the prosperity and development of socialist democracy. In addition, the new constitution also affirms the various basic obligations of Soviet citizens that are closely related to rights and embody the combination of personal interests and social interests, socialist legal principles and communist moral standards, such as observing the constitution and laws, abiding by labor discipline, respecting the rules of socialist public life, protecting and consolidating socialist public property, defending the motherland and serving in the military, and so on. The basic rights and obligations of Soviet citizens fixed by the Constitution demonstrate the deep concern of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government for the material and cultural life of the working people, educate them to establish new communist moral customs, and encourage the Soviet people to further improve their political activism and labor activism, and to carry out selfless labor and struggle to defend and enhance the Soviet motherland. Kalinin said it well: "The provisions of the Constitution are not only the legal provisions of the rights and obligations of Soviet citizens, but also a powerful factor in educating people."
      The Soviet Constitution is a great summary of the victory of socialism and socialist democracy that the Soviet people have already won. It is a banner for the exploited working people all over the world to fight for their own social and national liberation. It illuminates the road for us to advance victoriously towards a socialist society like the sun. Today, our motherland, taking the Soviet Constitution as an example, combined with our own rich experience, has creatively formulated and promulgated the draft of our country's first truly democratic constitution, which "consolidates the achievements and the new political and economic victories scored by the people of our country in the people's revolution and since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and reflects the fundamental requirements of the state during the transition period and the common desire of the broad masses of the people to build a socialist society" (see the preface of the draft constitution), which shows the new upsurge of our people's democratic construction and socialist construction. There is no doubt that under the radiance of our great socialist-type constitution, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, through the united efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely build our motherland into a glorious, brilliant and free, happy socialist country, and we will surely further win the fruits of the victory of socialism and socialist democracy that the new Soviet Constitution has already fixed.

    苏联宪法是社会主义胜利的伟大总结
    王向明
    苏联宪法是胜利的社会主义国家的根本法，它真实地反映了在工人阶级专政条件下的全体苏联人民的意志，用立法手续固定了已经争得的社会主义社会制度与国家制度的基本原则，成为了苏维埃国家现行立法的法定基础。
    现行苏联宪法是在一九三六年十二月五日由非常第八次苏联苏维埃代表大会通过的。这个宪法标志着社会主义制度与社会主义民主在苏联的完全的彻底的胜利，它是苏联进入完成社会主义建设和逐渐过渡到共产主义社会的新的历史时期的里程碑。
    苏联新宪法（以下凡称苏联新宪法都是指一九三六年通过的）是经过全民讨论然后通过的，单是这一点就表明了它的民主性。在宪法正式通过前，苏联人民曾经怀着极大的热忱、积极地、认真地参加了宪法草案的全国规模的讨论。讨论的时间有五个多月之久。一共举行了四十五万八千四百四十一次各种劳动者的大会，十万零五千七百二十二次各苏维埃代表小组的会议，五万九千一百七十一次各级苏维埃及其执行委员会的大会，参加这些会议的共有五千一百五十多万人。劳动者对宪法草案提出的建议和补充意见总数在一百五十万件以上。这些数字生动而有力地证明了：苏联新宪法“并不是什么委员会所臆想出来的，它并不是法律家草写的，它也不是从别的什么宪法抄来的”（列宁语），而是已经解放了的、完全摆脱了剥削制度的全体苏联人民亲自来拟订的。劳动人民用这个宪法记录下了自己反对剥削者的斗争经验与组织经验，把已经取得的社会主义的胜利果实用立法手续固定起来了。
    苏联新宪法用简明的字句记载了社会主义制度已经在苏联成为活生生的现实。在一九一八年七月通过的第一个苏维埃宪法（苏俄宪法）中，曾经明确地规定了苏维埃国家的基本任务是：无情地镇压剥削阶级的反抗，消灭人剥削人的现象，建立社会主义的社会制度。在第一个争取社会主义胜利的宪法的旗帜下，在共产党的英明领导下，工人阶级和全体劳动者粉碎了内外敌人的阴谋，打败了地主资本家和外国帝国主义者的联合进攻；按照列宁所拟订的新经济政策，实现了国家的社会主义工业化和农业的集体化，终于使社会主义公有制成为了苏维埃社会巩固不移的唯一的经济基础。到一九三五年，百分之九十六的生产资料就已经为国家、集体农庄和合作社所掌握，资本主义成份已经完全消灭，个体农民经济已经被排挤到次要地位。这样，正如斯大林所指出：“事实说明：我们在苏联已建成社会主义社会底基础，我们现在所还要做的事情不过是在这个基础上建成上层建筑物……”苏联新宪法的颁布便是斯大林这一指示的具体实施。苏联新宪法用立法形式固定了社会主义经济是苏联的统治的经济形式。宪法明文规定：“由于铲除资本主义经济体系、废除生产工具和生产资料私有制及消灭人对人剥削的结果而奠定起来的社会主义经济体系及生产工具与生产资料的社会主义所有制，构成苏联的经济基础。”（第四条）宪法指出：全民所有制和合作社集体农庄所有制是社会主义所有制的两种形式，而全民所有制则是最高的领导的形式。同时，宪法承认并保障公民对于消费资料的个人所有权和继承权，容许并保护残存的自力经营而绝不剥削他人劳动的个体农民及手工业者的小私有经济。为宪法所固定的生产资料的社会主义所有制是社会主义生产关系的基础，它决定了人们在生产过程中同志般合作和社会主义互助的新型关系，为社会生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路，为国民经济有计划按比例发展的经济法则和社会主义基本经济法则发生作用提供了充分的可能性。宪法第十一条极为清楚地写道：“苏联的经济生活受国家的国民经济计划的决定及指导，以便增进社会财富，不断提高劳动者
  的物质及文化水准，巩固苏联的独立并加强其国防能力。”在固定了社会主义公有制的经济的同时，苏联新宪法并确认了劳动和分配的社会主义原则。早在一九一八年的苏俄宪法中就已规定：“为了消灭社会中的寄生阶层和组织经济起见，施行普遍劳动义务制”；“承认劳动为共和国全体公民的义务
  并宣布下列口号：‘不劳动者不得食！’”。而在苏联新宪法中则进一步明白地规定：“按‘不劳动者不得食’的原则，劳动为苏联每一有劳动能力公民的应尽义务与光荣事业。实行‘各尽所能，按劳取酬’的社会主义原则。”这就表明了：社会主义社
  会是建筑在劳动的基础上，在由于生产力发展水平的限制，还不能实行“各取所需”的分配原则的条件下，用“按劳分配”的原则就可以促使劳动者去积极提高劳动生产率，并且教育着他们正确地把个人利益与社会利益结合起来，在使社会财富不断增加的基础上，求得个人日益增长的物质与文化需要的最大限度的满足。现实生活一再雄辩地证明：苏联新宪法所固定下来的社会主义经济制度，永远不知危机和失业为何物，不知贫困和破产为何物，而使全社会成员有一切可能享受到丰裕的物质生活和文化生活。在社会主义制度下，一切剥削阶级都已被消灭，整个社会由劳动者，即工人阶级、农民阶级和劳动知识分子所构成。宪法第一条就公开地宣布：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为工农社会主义国家。”丝毫也不掩饰地揭示了苏维埃国家的阶级本质，明确地规定了苏联的国体，这便是以坚固持久的工农联盟为基础的工人阶级专政的国家。所有的工人、农民和知识分子不仅本身的面貌已经涣然一新而且彼此之间的利益已趋一致，其阶级界线和本质差别也在日益泯灭着。这样，正如斯大林所指出：“在这种共同性的基础上，也就有苏维埃社会在道义上政治上的一致，苏联各族人民友谊，苏维埃爱
  国主义这样的动力扩展了起来。”唯其如此，苏联宪法把苏联共产党在苏维埃社会中的独占的领导地位固定起来，便是十分合乎规律的、完全可以理解
  的事情。苏联新宪法第一二六条直截了当地写道：“……工人阶级、劳动农民及劳动知识分子中最积极最觉悟的公民，则自愿结合于苏联共产党，即劳动群众为建成共产主义社会而奋斗中的先锋队，劳动群众所有一切社会团体及国家机关的领导核心。”在苏维埃社会里已经没有几个政党存在的基础，共产党便是苏维埃国家的领导力量；党的领导过去是、现在是并且将来仍是苏维埃国家一切胜利的决定性的根本保证。宪法的上述规定的重大意义也正在于此。
    苏联新宪法适应着苏维埃社会的新的经济关系和阶级关系，固定了业已进一步民主化的社会主义国家制度的基本原则。宪法确认全部国家权力属于全体城乡劳动者，并规定实现国家权力的形式为劳动者代表苏维埃，它也就是苏联的政治基础。大家知道，按照第一个苏维埃宪法和一九二四年苏联宪法，在推翻了地主资本家政权后建立起来的苏维埃政权是采取工农红军代表苏维埃的名称；适应着当时国内的政治、经济与文化情况，曾经实行有限制的（剥夺剥削者及其他反动分子的选举权）、不完全平等的（工人代表多于农民代表）、间接的（市、村苏维埃以外的中级和高级苏维埃代表大会）和公开投票的选举制度；立法权是由几个国家机关（全俄或全苏苏维埃代表大会、中央执行委员会及其主席团和人民委员会）分别行使。这一切以及其他类似的规定表明了当时苏维埃国家政治制度与法律制度的过渡性质，也正确地反映了第一次掌握国家权力的社会上绝大多数劳动群众的意志，有效地保障了他们当家作主的权利，并从而大大地巩固了年青的苏维埃政权。现在，按照苏联新宪法，各级劳动者代表苏维埃——从最高苏维埃直到村苏维埃一律实行了普遍的、平等的、直接的和秘密投票的最民主的选举制度，并相应地根据民主集中制原则彻底改组了国家权力的中央机关和地方机关的组织系统。
    根据苏联新宪法的规定，苏维埃国家机构是把立法权与行政权有机结合起来的统一完整的最民主的国家机构。
    最高苏维埃与各级地方苏维埃是苏联的代表机关，它们定期地由苏联公民直接选举出来，具有广泛的代表性和民主性。比如，第四届苏联最高苏维埃新选出的一千三百四十七名代表中，共有工人代表三一八名，农民代表二二○名，苏维埃知识分子代表八○九名。最高苏维埃与地方苏维埃的代表们，是人民的勤务员，他们都要遵照选民的指示来进行工作，接受选民的直接监督，并保持与选民的经常的密切联系，而选民则随时有权先期罢免个别不称职的代表。这个关于苏维埃代表与选民相互关系的民主原则，在苏联新宪法中得到了立法上的确认，宪法第一四二条明白地写道：“每一代表必须向选民报告本人及劳动者代表苏维埃的工作，并得随时由多数选民决定按法定手续罢免之。”按照苏联新宪法，苏联最高苏维埃是苏联的最高国家权力机关，它把全联盟的立法权集中到了自己手中，成为苏联的唯一立法机关。这样，苏联新宪法就使苏联最高苏维埃在苏维埃国家机关系统中占据了首要地位，起着类似发动机的作用；苏联最高苏维埃就直接以苏联人民主权意志的全权代表者的资格，决定全苏联立法、内政、外交、财政经济等各方面的重大问题，选举、组织和任命其他最高国家机关，并领导和监督它们的工作。苏联新宪法赋予苏联最高苏维埃以这样大的权柄和优越地位，正是劳动人民当权，主管国家大事的鲜明表现。
    在苏联新宪法原则的基础上所建立起来的地方苏维埃是苏联的地方国家权力机关。为保证政令的统一，各级地方苏维埃不享有立法权，但是，它们在各自的辖境内（省、市、区、村）则是人民主权意志的代表者，地方上一切经济与文化建设的大事情都由它们决定，地方上的其他国家机关（检察机关除外）都由它们产生并受它们领导与监督。地方苏维埃在保证中央的集中领导下，享有充分的自立性，有一切可能发挥地方的积极性和首创精神。苏联新宪法在解决中央与地方相互关系问题上完全是遵循着列宁所阐述过的下述著名指示：“在真正民主意义上所了解的集中制，是预定着在历史上第一次创造出来的那种不仅完全和无阻碍地发展地方特点，而且发展地方首创性，地方倡议性，发展各种各样向共同目标迈进的道路、方法和手段的可能性。”
    苏联新宪法从便于保证最高国家权力机关实现对国家管理机关（即行政机关）的经常领导和监督，以及行使最高国家权力一些经常性的职能的观点出发，规定在苏联最高苏维埃闭会期间，由苏联最高苏维埃选出由三十三人组成的最高苏维埃主席团。苏联最高苏维埃主席团是苏联最高苏维埃的常设机关，是苏联的集体总统。它以严格的集体领导和集体负责原则以及对最高代表机关的从属性，显示出了真正民主的特色。
    苏联新宪法在规定了国家权力机关系统的同时，还规定了建立在民主集中制原则基础上的国家管理机关系统。在中央，由最高苏维埃在其两院联席会上组织部长会议，作为苏联的政府，也就是最高国家管理机关，根据最高苏维埃通过的法律和主席团的命令，统一领导国家各方面的管理活动（内政、外交、国防、工业、农业等等）。在地方，由各级地方苏维埃选举各级地方国家管理机关—执行委员会，负责领导地方的经济与文化建设。按照宪法的规定，苏联的国家管理机关是在代表机关监督下进行工作的，它们对代表机关或其常设机关负责和报告工作。同时，为保证统一领导和因地制宜，以利于发挥国家管理机关、特别是地方国家管理机关的首创性，宪法规定在国家管理机关系统中实行双重领导的民主原则。如宪法第一○一条规定：地方苏维埃执行机关（包括执行委员会及其所属各工作部门）直接对同级地方苏维埃以及上级地方苏维埃执行机关报告工作。这种规定完全是以列宁的下述指示为出发点，即：“在那些要善于估计到是有真正不免的区别存在的地方，‘两重’从属制是必要的。加路格省的农业与嘉桑省的农业显然不同。……对于整个行政方面或管理机关也是如此。在这样的一切问题中，若不估计到地方特点，就会陷入官僚主义的集中制等等，就会妨碍地方工作人员去估计地方区别，这种估计乃是合理工作的基础。”
    苏维埃国家活动不仅表现在立法与管理（行政）方面，而且还表现在审判与法制监督方面。为此，苏联新宪法还规定了由相当的劳动者代表苏维埃选举并对其负责的、以苏联最高法院为首的国家审判机关系统（人民法院由选民直接选出，但它是统一的苏维埃审判机关系统中的基层环节），以便独立行使审判职权。为苏联新宪法所固定起来的审判机关，是实现无产阶级专政、镇压人民敌人的强大武器，是教育劳动群众遵守法纪的有效工具。同时，苏联宪法还规定了建立在垂直领导和个人负责原则基础上、按任命程序产生的、以从属于苏联最高苏维埃的苏联总检察长为首的检察机关系统，它们负责监督中央国家部门管理机关、地方机关、审判机关、公务人员和苏联公民对法律的严格遵守，以保证社会主义法制在全苏联境内的统一了解和适用。
      这样，苏联新宪法便以立法手续全面地确认国家机构的统一的完整的系统，从严整的组织制度方面强有力地保证着全部国家机构，在劳动群众的参加、推动与监督下，像一部灵巧的机器一样，积极为巩固和发展社会主义生产关系，为胜利实现逐步过渡到共产主义的任务而发挥应有的作用。
      还必须强调指出，苏联新宪法用国际主义的伟大原则，正确地调整了国内的民族关系，实现了各族人民的精诚团结。宪法第一二三条明白规定：
  “苏联公民不分民族及种族，在经济生活、国家生活、文化生活、及社会政治生活各方面一律平等，是为确定不移的法律。凡因民族或种族关系对公民权利作任何直接或间接限制，或者相反，赋予公民以直接或间接特权，以及散布任何种族或民族独尊思想，宣传民族或种族仇恨轻蔑观点的行为，均受法律的惩罚。”从这个总原则出发，宪法一方面规定，按照平权与自愿的原则，由十六个享有国家主权的加盟共和国组成伟大的社会主义联邦——苏联；另一方面又规定，根据在某些加盟共和国里聚居的少数民族发展的不同情况和特点，分别成立十六个自治共和国、九个自治省和十个民族州，作为在某些加盟共和国境内享有自治权利的民族区域自治的不同的组织形式。为着更好地保障在国家管理中各民族劳动者的平等权利，保证它们的共同利益与特殊利益的和谐一致，宪法规定：建立由两院（联盟院和民族院）构成的苏联最高苏维埃和全联盟的及联盟兼共和国的苏联各部门管理机关；最高苏维埃的法律用各民族文字公布；最高苏维埃主席团副主席人数与加盟共和国数目相等；在各民族共和国和其他民族自治单位的国家机关、学校里，使用本民族语文，由本民族干部参加工作；在诉讼中保证当事人运用本民族语言在法庭陈述，以及其他等等。正是借着这一切为苏联新宪法所固定起来并进
  一步发展了的民族政策的基本原则和实施的具体办法，苏维埃各民族走上了团结合作的道路，在俄罗斯民族无私帮助下，一切边疆地区的少数民族得以克服历史上遗留下来的经济与文化的落后状态，提高到先进民族的行列，共同建成了社会主义社会。
      最后，苏联新宪法还以专章系统地、全面地规定了苏联公民的基本权利与义务，更鲜明地体现了彻底的社会主义民主主义的精神。新宪法与一九一八年苏俄宪法相比较，首先扩大了权利与自由的范围，不仅规定了言论、出版、集会、结社、游行示威、宗教信仰等民主自由，而且进一步规定了劳动权，休息权，年老、患病及丧失劳动能力时的物质保障权和受教育权等最重要的社会经济与文化权利；第二、进一步地扩大了对实现这些权利的物质保障；第三、废除了在权利上的限制与差别，实现了在权利上的完全平等。正如斯大林在谈到新宪法的特点时所指出：“它不承认男性与女性，‘久居者’与‘暂居者’，有产者与无产者，受过教育者与未受过教育者有权利上的差别，而认为所有一切公民都有平等权利。决定每个公民在社会上的地位的不是财产状况，不是民族出身，不是性别，不是职位，而是各人的能力和各人的劳动。”这一切乃是剥削制度彻底消灭、社会主义制度全面胜利的必然结果，也正是社会主义民主繁荣与发展的显明标志之一。此外，新宪法还确认了与权利密切联系的，体现着个人利益与社会利益、社会主义法律原则与共产主义道德标准相互结合的苏联公民的各种基本义务，如遵守宪法和法律，遵守劳动纪律，尊重社会主义公共生活规则，保护与巩固社会主义公共财产，保卫祖国与服兵役等等。为宪法所固定的苏联公民的基本权利与义务，表现出了苏联共产党和苏联政府对于劳动人民的物质与文化生活的深厚关怀，教育着他们树立新的共产主义的道德风尚，鼓舞着苏联人民去进一步提高政治积极性和劳动积极性，去为捍卫和增强苏维埃祖国而进行忘我的劳动与斗争。加里宁说得好：“宪法条文不仅是苏联公民之权利和义务的法律规定，而且是教育人们的强有力的因素。”
      苏联宪法是苏联人民已经争得的社会主义与社会主义民主胜利的伟大总结，它是全世界被剥削劳动人民为争取自身社会解放与民族解放而斗争的旗帜，它像太阳般地照亮了我们向着社会主义社会胜利前进的道路。今天，我们的祖国，以苏联宪法为榜样，结合我们自己的丰富经验，创造性地制定并公布了我国第一个真正民主的宪法草案，它“巩固了我国人民革命的成果和中华人民共和国建立以来政治上、经济上的新胜利，并且反映了国家在过渡时期的根本要求和广大人民建设社会主义社会的共同愿望”（见宪草序言），表现着我国人民的民主主义建设和社会主义建设的新高涨。毫无疑问的，在我们这个伟大的社会主义类型宪法的光芒照耀下，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过全国各民族人民团结一致地努力，一定能把我们的祖国建成一个光辉灿烂和自由幸福的社会主义国家，一定能进一步争得像苏联新宪法所已经固定起来的社会主义与社会主义民主的胜利果实。
