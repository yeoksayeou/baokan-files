The activities of the Chinese Young Pioneers have become more extensive and active, and their content has become richer and more substantial since the Second National Conference on Children's Work in November 1953. The organization of the Young Pioneers has further expanded. Currently, there are more than eight million Young Pioneers members nationwide, and approximately 200,000 Young Pioneers counselors.

The Young Pioneers organizations in various regions actively cooperate with schools to educate children in loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and protecting public property. They have held various meaningful team day activities to cultivate children's love for the motherland. "The Heart of the Motherland's Heavy Industry—Anshan Iron and Steel" or "The Great Project—Guanting Reservoir" are the themes of team meetings in many schools. An elementary school in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, held a team meeting with the theme "A Corner of the Great Motherland—The Lovable Shuangshan Sand." Through visits, interviews, and data collection, the children saw how their hometown of Shuangshan Sand had changed its past impoverished state and its bright future. Therefore, they loved their hometown even more and aspired to engage in agricultural labor in their village in the future and strive to build a new socialist countryside. Under the care and education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, new ideological qualities are growing in children, and their good behavior is manifested in all aspects. Five Young Pioneers members from a township elementary school in Xingyang County, Henan Province, discovered a broken rail on the railway. Just as a train was approaching, they disregarded the danger, waved their red scarves, and ran towards the train. The driver stopped the train in time, saving a trainload of passengers and goods. This courageous behavior won unanimous praise from the masses.

Paying attention to guiding children to engage in beneficial social work and public labor in daily life has become a regular task of the Young Pioneers. Many Young Pioneers squadrons have "big friends" with whom they correspond regularly and have deep friendships. Famous labor models such as Wang Chonglun and Geng Changsuo often correspond with children. Children from Huigong Elementary School in Shenyang have established correspondence friendships with more than one hundred volunteer soldiers. The children also often have get-togethers with local troops and offer condolences to workers. It has become a habit for many Young Pioneers members to visit military families and families of martyrs during festivals, and they enthusiastically help military families with some tasks they can manage. This spring, 1,800 children in Beijing participated in the labor of greening the capital. Recently, the China Young Pioneers News published a letter written by Young Pioneers members from the First Central Elementary School in Dongsi District, Beijing. They suggested to children in various regions to respond to the government's call to use the school's open space to plant sunflowers and produce some industrial and edible oil for the country.

The organization of the Young Pioneers has increasingly become a powerful assistant in implementing new education in schools. The Young Pioneers organizations in various schools have carried out many activities to help children study hard and enrich their knowledge. At the beginning of the school year, they help newly arrived children become familiar with the learning environment and stabilize their learning emotions. They also hold team meetings named "Arithmetic World," "Music Evening," and "For a Socialist Society, We Should Become Healthy People." During holiday trips, they guide children to observe nature and collect specimens. Children have gained a lot of living knowledge in these activities. The Young Pioneers organizations in various regions also regularly hold meetings between children and writers and hold reading seminars, greatly increasing children's interest in reading newspapers and books. Since the Second National Conference on Children's Work, the circulation of the China Young Pioneers News has increased from 1.1 million copies to 1.7 million copies.

In the past six months, the cultural, recreational and sports activities of Young Pioneers members and children have also become more active. Most middle and elementary schools in Changchun City have established basketball and volleyball teams and regularly hold competitions. Many schools in Qinhuangdao, Changchun, and Liaodong Province have held ice skating activities. Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other cities have held city-wide children's art festivals or evening parties. Beijing and Shanghai have also held city-wide art exhibitions of children's works.

    少年先锋队已有八百多万队员
    日益成为学校中实施新教育的有力助手
    【新华社三十日讯】从一九五三年十一月第二次全国少年儿童工作会议召开以来，中国少年先锋队的活动更加广泛和活跃，内容也更加丰富和充实了。少年先锋队的组织进一步壮大起来。目前，全国已有少年先锋队队员八百多万名，少年先锋队的辅导员大约有二十万人。
    各地少年先锋队的组织，都积极配合学校向儿童进行爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物的教育，举行了各种有意义的队日活动，培养儿童热爱祖国的思想。“祖国重工业的心脏——鞍钢”或“伟大的工程——官厅水库”，是许多学校举行队会的主题。江苏省江阴县有一个小学举行了以“伟大祖国的一角——可爱的双山沙”为主题的队会。儿童们通过参观、访问和搜集资料，看到自己的家乡双山沙如何改变了过去的贫困面貌，以及它的美好前途，因而更加热爱自己的家乡，立志将来从事本村的农业劳动，为建设社会主义的新农村而努力。在共产党和人民政府的关怀教育下，儿童中正成长着新的思想品质，他们的优良行为表现在各方面。河南省荥阳县??乡小学的五个少年先锋队队员，发现铁路上的一根铁轨断了，这时正有一列火车驶来，他们便不顾危险，挥舞着红领巾，向火车跑去，司机及时停下车来，救出了一列车的乘客和货物。这种勇敢的行为，博得群众异口同声的称赞。
    注意在日常生活中引导儿童从事于有益的社会工作和公共劳动，已成为少年先锋队经常的任务。许多少年先锋队中队都有经常通讯的友谊深厚的“大朋友”。著名的劳动模范王崇伦、耿长锁等都经常和儿童们通信。沈阳惠工小学的儿童和一百多个志愿军战士建立了通信友谊。儿童们并经常和当地驻军联欢，向工人进行慰问。许多少年先锋队队员每逢节日去慰问军属、烈属已经成为习惯，他们热情地帮助军属做一些自己力所能及的工作。今年春季，北京市有一千八百个儿童参加了绿化首都的劳动。最近中国少年报发表了北京市东四区第一中心小学少年先锋队队员写的一封信，他们向各地的儿童建议，响应政府号召，利用学校的空地种植向日葵，为国家生产一些工业和食用的油料。
    少年先锋队的组织已日益成为学校中实施新教育的有力助手。各学校的少年先锋队组织开展了许多帮助儿童好好学习和丰富知识的活动。在开学时，帮助新到校的儿童熟悉学习环境，安定学习情绪。还举行命名为“算术世界”、“音乐晚会”、
  “为了社会主义社会，我们应该成为健康的人”的队会。在假日旅行时，引导儿童观察自然，搜集标本。儿童们在这些活动中，得到了许多活的知识。少年先锋队各地组织并经常举行儿童和作家的见面会，举行读书座谈会，使儿童们阅读书报的兴趣大大提高。第二次全国少年儿童工作会议以来，中国少年报的发行量已由一百一十万份增加到一百七十万份。
    半年来，少年先锋队队员和儿童们的文娱体育活动也更加活跃了。长春市大部分中、小学都成立了篮、排球队，经常举行比赛。秦皇岛、长春等市和辽东省的很多学校，都曾举行过滑冰活动。北京、上海、武汉、西安、南京、昆明、贵阳等市都举行过全市性的儿童文艺会演或晚会。北京和上海还举办了全市性的少年儿童美术作品展览。
