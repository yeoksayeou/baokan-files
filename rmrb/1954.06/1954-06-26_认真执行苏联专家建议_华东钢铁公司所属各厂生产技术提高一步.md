    Seriously Implement Soviet Experts' Suggestions
    Production Technology of Factories Affiliated with East China Steel Company Takes a Step Forward
    The steel factories affiliated with the East China Steel Company have seriously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, raising production technology to a new level. Of the more than 240 suggestions made by Soviet experts at the end of last year, the factories have already implemented more than 150.

    At the beginning of this year, the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, switched to smelting rimmed steel, eliminating the "shrinkage cavity" phenomenon in steel ingots when smelting killed steel, thereby improving quality and increasing output. In the past five months, this open-hearth furnace workshop has increased the production of steel ingots worth billions of yuan for the country, exceeding the national plan for January to May by 1.94 percent. Now, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 is experimenting with using converters to smelt rimmed steel. The open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 also began smelting a portion of rimmed steel from June.

    In the past, the steel rolling workshops of various factories generally had a situation where the steel heating capacity could not keep up with the steel rolling capacity, which limited the increase in steel production. In the first half of this year, New Shanghai Steel Plant and Shanghai Steel Plants No. 2 and No. 3 all improved their steel heating furnaces based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. After the steel rolling workshop of New Shanghai Steel Plant added a waist furnace to the steel heating furnace, the steel heating capacity increased by 27 percent compared to the original, and the output of rolled steel billets increased by 24.7 percent accordingly. Because Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2's second workshop improved its steel heating furnace, it can create 3 billion yuan more wealth for the country throughout the year.

    After Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2's second workshop improved its steel heating furnace, it changed the operation method of rolling angle steel according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, and the daily output of angle steel increased month by month. The average daily output of this workshop in May was equal to the average daily output plus five hours in January. In the past, when rolling angle steel, this factory had to manually lift a red-hot steel from the first rolling mill to the third rolling mill, and then from the second rolling mill to the fourth rolling mill. Such back-and-forth running was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Later, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, they rolled the steel in the order of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth rolling mills, which greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers, and the time for rolling each angle steel was shortened by three seconds compared to the original. The thousands of seconds saved every day can produce many more tons of angle steel.

    The factories have also implemented various suggestions made by Soviet experts in steelmaking, steel rolling, heat treatment, and other aspects, with good results. Some suggestions are still being actively prepared for implementation.

### 认真执行苏联专家建议  华东钢铁公司所属各厂生产技术提高一步

    认真执行苏联专家建议
    华东钢铁公司所属各厂生产技术提高一步
    华东钢铁公司所属各钢铁厂认真执行苏联专家建议，把生产技术提高到了新的水平。去年年底苏联专家提出的二百四十多条建议，各厂已经执行了一百五十多条。
    今年年初，上海钢铁一厂平炉车间根据苏联专家的建议改炼沸腾钢，消灭了原来炼镇静钢时钢锭的“缩孔”现象，因而提高了质量，增加了产量。五个多月来，这个平炉车间给国家增产了价值几十亿元的钢锭，超额百分之一点九四，实现了一月到五月份的国家计划。现在，上海钢铁一厂正在试验用转炉冶炼沸腾钢。上海钢铁三厂平炉车间从六月份起也开始冶炼一部分沸腾钢。
    各厂的轧钢车间，过去普遍存在烘钢能力赶不上轧钢能力的情况，限制了钢材产量的提高。今年上半年，新沪钢铁厂、上海钢铁二厂、三厂都根据苏联专家建议，改进了烘钢炉。新沪钢铁厂轧钢车间在烘钢炉上增设了腰炉以后，烘钢能力比原来提高了百分之二十七，轧钢胚的产量便跟着提高了百分之二十四点七。上海钢铁二厂第二车间因为改进了烘钢炉，今年全年可为国家多创造三十亿元的财富。
    上海钢铁二厂第二车间改进烘钢炉后，又根据苏联专家建议改变了轧制三角钢的操作方法，三角钢的日产量便逐月上升。这个车间五月份的平均一天的产量，等于一月份中平均一天又五小时的产量。这个厂过去在轧制三角钢时，要用人工把一根火红的钢从第一架轧钢机抬到第三架轧钢机，又从第二架抬到第四架轧钢机。这样的往返奔跑，既费时间又费人力。后来他们根据苏联专家的建议，顺着第一、第二、第三、第四、第五等架轧钢机的排列次序轧制下去，就大大减轻了工人的劳动强度，每轧一根三角钢的时间比原来缩短了三秒钟。每天节省下来的几千秒钟，可以多生产许多吨三角钢。
    各厂在炼钢、轧钢、热处理等方面，还实现了苏联专家提出的各种建议，效果都好。还有一些建议，各厂正在积极准备执行。　（新华社）
