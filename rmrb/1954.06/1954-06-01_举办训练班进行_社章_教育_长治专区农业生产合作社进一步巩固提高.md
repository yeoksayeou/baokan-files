The Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province held training classes for leading members of new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the district in January, providing "Charter" education to 14,068 participants. In the months following the training, agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the district universally carried out the work of studying and formulating cooperative charters.

Through the study and formulation of charters, not only did members further clarify the nature of the cooperative, the guiding principles, policies, and future of cooperative management, but they also resolved many specific problems. For example, the Zhang Zijie Cooperative in Yangcheng corrected its tendency towards speculative commercial production within the cooperative after studying the charter. After studying the charter, eight agricultural cooperatives in Tunliu County re-elected their cooperative cadres, with eleven cadres with poor work styles and selfishness being voted out of office. At the same time, the cooperative's organization was purified, and thirteen households of landlords and former rich peasants who had not changed their class status were removed from the cooperative. After studying the charter, the Xiaodonggou Cooperative in Jincheng launched criticism and self-criticism, inspiring the members' sense of ownership and initiative, actively proposing rationalization suggestions, and actively seeking fertilizer sources, accumulating more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer, so that each mu of land in the cooperative could be fertilized by an additional 11 dan. This improved the members' collectivist ideology and labor enthusiasm, further consolidating the cooperative's organization.

At present, county and district Party committees are continuing to summarize and promote the experience of studying and formulating charters in the previous stage, overcoming shortcomings such as charters being too large, too complex, or too simple, strengthening the leadership of members' charter education and charter formulation, and requiring that each cooperative formulate a charter before weeding, and that they be able to act in accordance with the charter.

    举办训练班进行“社章”教育
    长治专区农业生产合作社进一步巩固提高
    中共山西省长治地委，在一月份先后举办了全专区新老农业生产合作社的骨干分子训练班，对参加训练的一万四千零六十八人进行了“社章”教育。训练结束后的几个月中，全区的农业生产合作社普遍进行了学习社章和制订社章的工作。
    通过学习与制订社章，不仅使社员进一步明确了社的性质，办社的方针、政策和前途，而且也解决了许多具体问题。如阳城张子杰社经过学习社章纠正了社内经营商业投机生产的偏向。屯留县经过社章学习，有八个农业社重新选举了社务干部，其中有十一个作风不好和自私自利的社务干部落选；同时纯洁了社内组织，清洗了十三户未改变成份的地主与旧富农分子出社。晋城小东沟社经过学习社章，开展了批评与自我批评，启发了社员主人翁的思想自觉，积极提出合理化建议，主动寻找肥源，积肥二千余担，社内每亩地能增施肥料十一担。从而提高了社员的集体主义思想和劳动积极性，进一步巩固了社的组织。
    目前，各县、区党委，正在继续总结与推广前段学习与制订社章的经验，克服订社章中过大、过复杂或太简单等缺点，加强对社员的社章教育和制订社章的领导，要求在锄苗前，各个社订出社章，并能按章办事。
