Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: The twenty-seven French medical personnel released by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam left Dien Bien Phu for Hanoi at 12:30 on June 1st, according to Vietnam News Agency on June 3rd. The reason for the delay in their departure was that the Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Indochina did not provide his representative, Colonel Droum, with an official letter regarding the evacuation of the aforementioned French medical personnel.

Before leaving Dien Bien Phu, Major Dr. Grovin, on behalf of the aforementioned twenty-seven released French medical personnel, expressed gratitude for President Ho Chi Minh's humanitarian policy and stated that they would tell the French people the truth about Vietnam to promote the movement demanding the restoration of peace in Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, June 3rd: According to Vietnam News Agency, the twenty-seven French Expeditionary Corps medical personnel captured by the Vietnamese People's Army and released by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam jointly wrote a letter to President Ho Chi Minh to express their gratitude before leaving Dien Bien Phu. The letter stated that after you released our wounded and Miss Geneviève de Galard, you released us. We are excited to be able to return to our homeland and reunite with our families. After returning to our country, we will fight for the peace that we fervently desire.

The released French medical personnel also wrote individual letters to President Ho Chi Minh. Major Dr. Grovin said in his letter that after returning to France, I will strive to make my family and those around me understand the reasons why you have been waging this fervent and indomitable struggle. I will make those around me hope for an end to France's futile war. Captain Dr. Radamani's letter said, when I return to France, I will do my best for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and for peace among all peoples.

   越南政府释放二十七名法军医务工作人员
   他们离奠边府前联名写信感谢胡志明主席
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：越南民主共和国政府释放的二十七名法军医务工作人员在六月一日十二时三十分离奠边府去河内。他们启程延迟的原因是印度支那法军总司令部没有给它的代表德劳姆上校带来关于撤运上述法军医务工作人员的公函。
    在离开奠边府之前，法军少校军医格罗温代表上述二十七名被释放的法军医务工作人员，对胡志明主席的人道政策表示感谢，并表示要把越南的真实情况告诉法国人民，以促进要求恢复越南和平的运动。
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府释放的被越南人民军俘掳的二十七名法国远征军医务工作人员，在离开奠边府以前联名写信给胡志明主席表示感谢。信中说，在释放了我们的伤员和杰尼维夫·德格拉尔小姐以后，您释放了我们。我们为得以重返祖国跟我们的家属团聚而感到兴奋。我们回国以后将为我们所热烈期望的和平而斗争。
    这些被释放的法军医务工作人员还单独写信给胡志明主席。少校军医格罗温在信中说，回到法国以后，我将努力使我的家属和我周围的人了解你们所以一直在进行热烈的、不屈不挠的斗争的原因。我将使我周围的人希望停止法国这场徒劳无益的战争。上尉军医拉达马尼的信说，我回到法国的时候，要为越南人民的正义斗争以及各国人民之间的和平而尽我最大的努力。
