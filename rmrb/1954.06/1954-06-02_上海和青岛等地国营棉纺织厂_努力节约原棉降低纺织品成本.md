State-owned Cotton Textile Factories in Shanghai and Qingdao etc.
Strive to Save Raw Cotton and Reduce Textile Costs
[Our newspaper's report] State-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and the Northwest are striving to save raw cotton and reduce costs.

　　Many state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai have been working hard to save cotton consumption this year. In April, twelve factories reduced their cotton consumption compared to the first quarter. The state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory, which has had relatively low cotton consumption since the fourth quarter of last year, further reduced its cotton consumption per yarn in April by more than four catties compared to March. The state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory has seen a monthly decrease in cotton consumption since January. In April, the average amount of raw cotton used per yarn was four catties less than in the first quarter. According to the factory's calculations, if it can maintain the cotton consumption level of April, the factory can save nearly 250,000 catties of raw cotton throughout the year, which, when spun into yarn and woven into cloth, would be enough to make 160,000 sets of uniforms. In many factories, saving raw cotton and improving quality has become the most important thing for employees. In April, the employees of the state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory proposed 56 rationalization proposals, 14 of which were about saving raw cotton. With the spirit of technological innovation, the employees of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory have continuously improved the efficiency of the opener and carding machines, strengthened the removal of impurities and the recovery of effective fibers. One hundred catties of cotton can now be made into ninety-six catties of cotton lap, an increase of three catties compared to last spring, and the impurities contained in the cotton lap are less than one percent. Many factories, due to strengthened technical measures, reuse all "chop-cut flowers" (抄斩花), which not only saves raw cotton, but also does not affect product quality.

　　The eight state-owned cotton textile factories under the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau have made some achievements in saving cotton consumption over the past few years. However, the cotton consumption per yarn in each factory is still unstable. If the cotton consumption per yarn in the eight factories can reach the level of the Tianjin area in 1953 this year, then 2 million catties of raw cotton can be saved throughout the year. In order to bring the cotton consumption of each factory closer to normal and further save raw cotton and reduce costs, the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau decided to implement fixed quota management of raw cotton this year, and will first conduct experiments in the state-owned Qingdao No. 3 and No. 4 Cotton Textile Factories. Now, the Raw Cotton Quota Working Group organized by the Qingdao Textile Administration Bureau has gone to the state-owned Qingdao No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory to assist in carrying out the work. In the process of trial implementation, combined with the factory's promotion of job planning, the focus will be on formulating the finished product rate of each section and establishing corresponding management responsibility system, doing a good job in setting the fixed length and weight of semi-finished products in the workshop and the quota of reserves, and correspondingly rectifying and improving the workshop's receipt, payment, inventory and scheduling statistics.

　　In order to save raw cotton, the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory manufactured a fiber impurity separator on May 23, and trial operation proved that it worked well. In the future, using this machine to process chop-cut flowers and fallen cotton, extracting effective fibers from them for spinning, according to preliminary estimates, can save 200,000 catties of raw cotton throughout the year. The factory's employees clearly recognized that the earlier the "fiber impurity separator" is successfully trial-produced, the more raw materials will be saved, so they played an active role and overcame many difficulties in the trial production process. For example, when the trial production started, there were no detailed construction drawings, so the technicians drew construction drawings by groping according to simple instructions; the veteran workers Xu Songqiao and Hu Weichen took the initiative to learn drawing methods from the technicians and helped draw six or seven kinds of drawings. In the production of parts, the employees continued to improve tools and improve work efficiency. During the test run, the workshop director Wang Muzeng and the veteran workers Li Yixing and Zhou Jiayi often studied the machine by the machine until late at night before returning. Throughout the trial production process, the repair shop also received help and support from all sides.

### 上海和青岛等地国营棉纺织厂  努力节约原棉降低纺织品成本

    上海和青岛等地国营棉纺织厂
    努力节约原棉降低纺织品成本
    【本报讯】上海、青岛和西北等地的国营棉纺织厂，努力节约原棉，降低成本。
    上海市许多国营棉纺织厂今年努力节约用棉量，四月份，有十二个厂的用棉量比第一季度减少。去年第四季度以来用棉量一直比较低的国营上海第十六棉纺织厂，四月份每件纱的用棉量又比三月份减少了四斤多。国营上海第十九棉纺织厂从一月份以来，用棉量逐月下降，四月份每件纱平均比第一季少用四斤原棉。据这个厂计算，如果能继续保持四月份的用棉数量，全厂全年可以比计划节省原棉近二十五万斤，把这些棉花纺成纱织成布，足够做十六万套制服。在许多厂里，节约原棉提高质量已成为职工们最关心的事情。国营上海第十九棉纺织厂职工在四月份提出了五十六条合理化建议，其中有十四条是关于节约原棉的。国营上海第十六棉纺织厂的职工们以技术革新的精神，不断提高清花机和梳棉机的效能，加强了排除杂质和回收有效纤维的作用，一百斤棉花可以制成九十六斤棉卷，比去年春季提高了三斤，棉卷中含的杂质不到百分之一。许多厂由于加强了技术措施，抄斩花全部回用，不但节省了原棉，产品质量也未受影响。
    青岛纺织管理局所属八个国营棉纺织厂，几年来在节约用棉方面已经获得了一些成绩。但是，各厂每件纱的用棉量现在还不稳定，如果八个厂今年每件纱的用棉量能够达到天津地区一九五三年的水平，那么全年就能节约原棉二百万斤。青岛纺织管理局为了使各厂的用棉量能够接近正常，并进一步节约原棉、降低成本，决定今年试行原棉定额管理，并先在国营青岛第三和第四两个棉纺织厂进行试验。现在，青岛纺织管理局组成的原棉定额工作组，已经到国营青岛第三棉纺织厂协助展开工作。在试行的过程中，将结合该厂推行作业计划的工作，以制订各工段的制成率和建立相应的管理责任制度为重点，做好车间半成品的定长、定重和储备量定额，并相应地整顿和健全车间收付盘存和调度统计等工作。
    国营西北第一棉纺织厂为节约原棉，已在五月二十三日制造了一部纤维杂质分离机，试车证明效果良好。将来运用这种机器处理抄斩花、落棉，从中提取有效纤维，用来纺纱后，据初步估计，全年可节约原棉二十万市斤。该厂职工明确认识到“纤维杂质分离机”早一天试制成功，就会节约更多的原料，所以在试制过程中发挥了积极性，克服了许多困难。如开始试制时没有施工详图，技术人员就根据简单说明，摸索着绘施工图；老工人许松乔、胡维臣主动向技术人员学习绘图方法，帮助绘制了六、七种图纸。在制作配件当中，职工们更不断地改进工具，提高工作效率。在试车中，车间主任王慕曾，老工人李义兴、周家义常常在机器旁研究到深夜才回去。在整个试制过程中，修机间还得到了各方面的帮助和支持。
