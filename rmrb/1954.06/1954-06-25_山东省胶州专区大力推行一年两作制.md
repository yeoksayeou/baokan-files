    Jiaozhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, Vigorously Promotes a Double-Cropping System Per Year
    Jiaozhou Prefecture in Shandong Province is vigorously promoting a double-cropping system per year to increase the yield per unit area of farmland.
    Currently, 250,000 mu of land in Jiaozhou Prefecture have been converted from a three-crops-in-two-years system to a double-cropping system per year. After the change, the yield per mu generally increased by more than 30% compared to the past. The Xiao Peiming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaowang Gezhuang, Jiaoxian County, planted eight mu of autumn corn after the wheat harvest in 1952, and then planted wheat after the autumn harvest. After calculating after the wheat harvest in 1953, the income per mu was 37% higher than the three-crops-in-two-years system. Li Yuzhen, a family member of a revolutionary martyr in Hexitun Village of the county, intercropped autumn corn and early-maturing soybeans after the wheat harvest in 1952. At the autumn harvest, each mu yielded 197 jin of soybeans and 158 jin of corn, an increase of 52% compared to before the change. Based on existing experience, Jiaozhou Prefecture plans to expand the double-cropping area by 500,000 mu this year, which is expected to increase grain production by more than 100 million jin.
    In order to ensure the thorough completion of this task, Jiaozhou Prefecture, in addition to having responsible party and government cadres personally take charge and strengthen leadership, has also allocated more than 2 million jin of high-quality autumn corn seeds from Laiyang Prefecture in terms of materials, and the region has independently solved more than 4 million jin of early-maturing small green soybean seeds. In terms of fertilization, in addition to mobilizing farmers to increase the accumulation of natural fertilizers, 5 million jin of chemical fertilizers have also been prepared. The Jiaozhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office also convened a regional agricultural technology conference in early June to solve specific problems such as sowing, fertilization, close planting, and prevention and control of natural disasters in the double-cropping system.

    山东省胶州专区大力推行一年两作制
    山东省胶州专区大力推行一年两作制，提高农田单位面积产量。
    胶州专区现已有二十五万亩土地改变了两年三作制，实行一年两作制。改变以后，一般每亩收成都比过去增加百分之三十以上。胶县小王戈庄萧培明农业生产合作社，在一九五二年麦收后种了八亩秋玉米，秋收后又种上小麦，到一九五三年麦收后计算一下，比两年三作制每亩多收入百分之三十七。该县河西屯村烈属李玉珍，一九五二年麦收后，进行秋玉米和早熟大豆间种，秋收时，每亩收豆子一百九十七斤，玉米一百五十八斤，比改变前增产百分之五十二。根据已有经验，胶州专区今年计划扩大一年两作面积五十万亩，约可增产一亿多万斤粮食。
    胶州专区为了保证这一任务的彻底完成，除党政负责干部都亲自掌握，加强领导外，在物资方面，从莱阳专区调拨秋玉米良种二百多万斤，本区自行解决了早熟小青豆种籽四百多万斤。施肥方面，除动员农民增积自然肥料外，还准备了化学肥料五百万斤。胶州专署并在六月初召开了全区性的农业技术会议，解决了一年两作中的播种、施肥、密植和防治自然灾害等具体问题。           （宋秉钧）
