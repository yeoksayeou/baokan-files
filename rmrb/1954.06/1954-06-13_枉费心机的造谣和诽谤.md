The Geneva Conference fully exposed the U.S. ruling clique's fear of negotiation and peace. To cover up its policy of obstructing and undermining the Geneva Conference, and to intimidate other countries into following its lead, it has resorted to distorting facts and even fabricating slander.

The U.S. ruling clique's shameful acts of fabricating slander have reached such a point that U.S. official institutions are constantly publishing so-called documents and reports that fabricate facts. On May 12, the U.S. government administrative department published a document purportedly compiled by "probably a CCP organization," the "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Aiding Vietnam," part of which was titled "Handbook for Political Workers Going to Vietnam." On May 15, the U.S. Department of Defense issued an "intelligence report." On June 2, Republican Senator Nolan released a so-called "memorandum" by a Chinese revolutionary leader on a new program for world revolution, which was also supposedly provided by the U.S. Department of Defense. It is astonishing that the U.S. Department of Defense and other government agencies have become places for publicly fabricating rumors.

What exactly did U.S. official institutions fabricate in these documents and reports? They are all extremely absurd and ridiculous lies. For example, the fabricated document released on May 12 insisted that "China and the Soviet Union have infiltrated Indochina." But how to prove this "infiltration"? According to the document, it was based on "six Molotov factory trucks" discovered "when French forces attacked Lang Son in July 1953," and a so-called Chinese "Handbook for Political Workers Going to Vietnam," while these "political workers" were part of "tens of thousands" of the so-called "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Aiding Vietnam." Of course, the so-called "six Molotov factory trucks" can only be laughed at, and where are the "tens of thousands" of the so-called "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Aiding Vietnam"? Obviously, the hapless American fabricators cannot prove the existence of this non-existent "volunteer army" to the people. All they could do was resort to the most despicable means of fabrication, distorting a three-year-old article from the "Moscow University Bulletin" discussing China, to "scientifically" demonstrate this so-called "infiltration," even though this article did not mention Indochina at all. Students at Moscow University can smash the U.S. official slander to pieces.

The "intelligence report" published by the U.S. Department of Defense also insisted that there were "Russian corps" in Korea and that "the initial definite steps of Chinese intervention in Korea" "began in 1939." What a foolish fantasy. The American aggressors themselves never discovered such "Russian corps" during the three years of the Korean War. How could a normal person imagine that in 1939, when part of China's territory and the whole of Korea were occupied by Japanese imperialists, and the Chinese people and patriotic Korean people were fighting against Japanese imperialist aggression and enslavement, there would be any "steps" of "Chinese intervention in Korea"?

However, the American madmen are so incredibly foolish. Thus, Nolan also fabricated that "memorandum" which stipulated that "victory must be achieved before 1973" and that "the entire Asia and Africa should be plunged into the communist camp," which was supposedly the "Communist Party's policy on world revolution." Look, achieving "world hegemony" precisely in 1973, this is the "policy" that Nolan, the guardian of Chiang Kai-shek's political corpse, could easily obtain from Taiwan.

What is the purpose of the U.S. ruling clique publishing these purely fabricated documents and reports one after another without shame? Huang Hua, the spokesperson for our delegation to the Geneva Conference, pointed out in a statement on the 5th of this month: "Obviously, this is fabricated according to the needs of the U.S. situation at the Geneva Conference, and its purpose is to create a tense atmosphere, intimidate countries and people who demand peace, and obstruct the efforts of the Geneva Conference to ease international tensions."

People know that the U.S. ruling clique's situation at the Geneva Conference is unfavorable. Before and during the conference, both inside and outside the conference, they have carried out and are continuing to carry out a series of conspiracies, and have consistently adhered to arrogant and unreasonable demands and a stubborn attitude of refusing to negotiate on both the Korean issue and the Indochina issue. All these practices of the U.S. ruling clique revolve around one goal: to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Conference in order to expand the Indochina War and establish a U.S. colonial empire in Asia. It is precisely because of this that U.S. diplomatic representatives are eager to interrupt the Korean issue negotiations and obstruct the realization of a ceasefire in Indochina, while doing everything possible to cobble together a Southeast Asian aggressive bloc. This approach of the U.S. ruling clique has made the people of all countries, especially the people of Asia, see more clearly the ambitions of the U.S. colonialists. Public opinion in various countries, especially in Asian countries, unanimously condemns the U.S. aggressive and adventurous activities, and even some U.S. allies are unwilling to completely follow it. The U.S.'s "policy of strength" has repeatedly been frustrated, and its international status has been declining.

It is this situation that has made the U.S. ruling clique basely resort to fabrication. The Associated Press reporter revealed that the purpose of U.S. official institutions publishing a series of documents fabricating facts is to "strengthen the power of the U.S.'s position, which is to try to make Britain interested in the issue of jointly assisting Indochina, and to use objective examples to illustrate that it is not possible to deal with Asian red elements as equal members on the diplomatic stage." In other words, to create an atmosphere of terror to intimidate other countries to follow the United States.

Therefore, after U.S. official institutions manufactured the lies of "China and the Soviet Union infiltrating Indochina" and "the Communist Party's new program for world revolution," U.S. President Eisenhower, at a press conference on June 10, and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in a speech delivered on the same day, also talked at length about "communist aggression" and the Communist Party's "new imperialist colonialism." However, Eisenhower did not seem to believe Nolan's "memorandum" that the Communist Party would "achieve world hegemony" within twenty years, and instead invented a claim that "communist aggression" would "last for forty years." In any case, in the United States, those who are keen on fabricating and slandering are no longer just professional specialists.

However, this base tactic of the U.S. ruling clique cannot conceal their aggressive and adventurous conspiracies in any way. People remember that just before the Geneva Conference, Dulles shouted that China was "very close" to participating in the Indochina War, using this to incite fear of war and demand that Britain, France, and other countries jointly "take risks" to expand the Indochina War. But what was the actual result? On the one hand, Dulles's fabrication and intimidation did not scare anyone, and the "united action" he shouted about has not been realized; on the other hand, the United States has further interfered in the Indochina War. Now, along with the lies manufactured by U.S. official institutions, the U.S. ruling clique is openly emphasizing the need for the U.S. to take "tough action." In this uproar, powerful figures of the U.S. ruling clique, such as Senators Nolan, Wiley, Bridges, and U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney, all appeared. In a speech delivered on June 5, Nolan openly demanded that people abandon the "extremely dangerous idea" of "continuing to negotiate at the Geneva Conference," and said that the U.S. "should face the fact" that "the U.S. may have to fight in Indochina as it did in Korea." Do these facts not clearly prove that the lies fabricated by U.S. official institutions, including Nolan, are precisely to create excuses for the U.S. to directly intervene in and expand the Indochina War?

It is precisely because of this that the U.S. ruling clique's slander against China and the Soviet Union cannot but be futile. The peace-loving Asian people who are fighting for their national independence and all honest people in the world see very clearly that it is none other than the U.S. ruling clique itself that is trying to expand the war in Asia and use it to establish a new colonial rule. Among honest people in Asia and around the world, U.S. lies have no market. Even U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, who recently returned to the United States from the Far East, could not help but sadly admit: "The Asian people do not believe that the Communists are carrying out aggression in Indochina." Of course, this fact will not stop the U.S. government from lying. On the contrary, it is acting according to Hitler's instructions, hoping that the bigger and more numerous the lies, the more likely people will believe them someday. But Hitler lied all his life, and who believes him now?

    枉费心机的造谣和诽谤
    高集
    日内瓦会议充分暴露了美国统治集团害怕协商、害怕和平的面目。他们为了掩饰自己阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议的政策，并为了恫吓其他国家跟着它走，不惜乞灵于歪曲事实以至造谣诽谤的手段。
    美国统治集团造谣诽谤的可耻行径，甚至达到了这样的地步，竟由美国官方机构不断发表捏造事实的所谓文件和报告，五月十二日，美国政府行政管理部门公布了一个据说由“大概是一个中共的组织”“中国人民援越志愿军”编纂的文件，其中有一部分名为“赴越政工人员手册”；五月十五日美国国防部又发表了一份“情报报告”；六月二日美国共和党参议员诺兰公布的一个所谓中国革命领袖关于世界革命新纲领的“备忘录”，据说也是美国国防部提供的。美国国防部和其他政府机构竟成为公开造谣的场所，是十分惊人的。
    美国官方机构在这些文件和报告中，都捏造了些什么呢？那都是极端荒谬和可笑的谎言。譬如，五月十二日公布的那个捏造的文件硬说“中苏两国渗入印度支那”。但是，怎样来证明这种“渗入”呢？根据这个文件所提供的是：“一九五三年七月法军进攻谅山的时候”发现的“六辆莫洛托夫工厂的载重汽车”，和所谓中国“赴越政工人员手册”，而这些“政工人员”又是“成千成万名”所谓“中国人民援越志愿军”的一部分。当然，所谓“六辆莫洛托夫工厂的载重汽车”只能令人笑煞，而“成千成万名”的所谓“中国人民援越志愿军”又在那里呢？显然，倒霉的美国造谣者是无法向人们证实这种根本不存在的“志愿军”的。他们所能做到的，竟不惜采取最卑鄙的捏造手段，歪曲“莫斯科大学公报”三年前的一篇论述中国的文章，来“科学地”论证这种所谓“渗入”，虽然这篇文章根本没有只字提到印度支那。莫斯科大学的学生就可以把美国官方的造谣诽谤打得粉碎。
    美国国防部发表的“情报报告”又硬说在朝鲜有“俄国兵团”，又说：“中国在朝鲜进行干涉的最初的确定的步骤”，“是在一九三九年开始的”。这是何等愚蠢的狂想。美国侵略者自己在侵朝战争三年中就从来没有发现过这样的“俄国兵团”。正常的人更如何能够想像：一九三九年，当中国的一部分领土和全朝鲜被日本帝国主义者侵占着，中国人民和热爱祖国的朝鲜人民都在为反抗日本帝国主义的侵略和奴役而斗争的时候，会有什么“中国在朝鲜进行干涉”的“步骤”呢？
    然而，美国的狂人们就是这样不能令人置信地愚蠢。因而，诺兰也就编造了那个规定要在“一九七三年以前取得胜利”，使“整个亚洲和非洲陷入共产党阵营”的“共产党关于世界革命的政策”的“备忘录”。你看，不迟不早，竟是在一九七三年“取得世界霸权”，这就是蒋介石政治僵尸的守护者诺兰垂手可以从台湾那里取得的“政策”。
    美国统治集团毫不知耻地一个接着一个公布这些纯系捏造的文件和报告，是为了什么呢？我国出席日内瓦会议代表团发言人黄华在本月五日发表的声明中曾指出：“显然这是按照日内瓦会议上美国处境的需要而捏造的，其目的是为了制造紧张空气，恫吓要求和平的国家和人民，阻挠日内瓦会议缓和国际紧张局势的努力。”
    人们知道，美国统治集团在日内瓦会议上的处境是不妙的。他们在会议之前和会议期间，在会内和会外，进行了并正继续进行着一系列的阴谋活动，在朝鲜问题上和印度支那问题上一直坚持着蛮横无理的主张和拒绝协商的顽梗态度。美国统治集团的这一切做法，都是围绕着一个目的，那就是：阻挠和破坏日内瓦会议，以便扩大印度支那战争，在亚洲建立美国的殖民帝国。正是因为如此，美国的外交代表才急切地要中断朝鲜问题的谈判，并阻挠印度支那停战的实现，同时竭尽一切手段来拼凑东南亚侵略集团。美国统治集团的这种做法，使世界各国人民，特别是亚洲人民更加看清了美国殖民主义者的野心。各国舆论，特别是亚洲国家的舆论一致谴责美国的侵略冒险活动，甚至美国的一些盟国也不愿意完全追随它。美国的“实力政策”一再遭到了挫折，它的国际地位日益降低了。
    正是这种情势，使得美国统治集团卑劣地乞灵于造谣。美联社记者就曾透露，美国官方机构公布一系列的捏造事实的文件的目的就是要“加强美国这种立场的力量，即设法使英国对共同援助印度支那问题发生兴趣，并用客观的例子来说明没有可能把亚洲赤色分子作为外交舞台上的平等成员跟他们打交道。”换句话说，要制造恐怖空气恫吓其他国家跟美国走。
    因此，在美国官方机构制造了“中苏两国渗入印度支那”和“共产党关于世界革命新纲领”的谎言之后，美国总统艾森豪威尔在六月十日的记者招待会上和美国国务卿杜勒斯在同日发表的演说中，也大谈其“共产主义的进攻”和共产党的“新的帝国主义殖民主义”了。不过，艾森豪威尔似乎并不相信诺兰的“备忘录”中所谓共产党将在二十年内“取得世界霸权”的说法，而另外发明了一个“共产主义的进攻”将“持续四十年之久”的说法。不论如何，在美国，热中于造谣诽谤的人，已不单是职业的专门家了。
    可是，美国统治集团的这种卑劣手法无论如何掩饰不了他们的侵略冒险阴谋。人们记得，就在日内瓦会议举行之前，杜勒斯就曾叫嚷过中国已“十分接近”于参加印度支那战争，借此煽动战争恐惧，要求英法等国与美国共同“担当风险”来扩大印度支那战争。但是，实际的结果是怎样的呢？一方面是杜勒斯的造谣恫吓没有吓倒任何人，他所叫嚷的“联合行动”还没有实现；另一方面则是美国更进一步地干涉印度支那战争了。现在，随着美国官方机构所制造的谎言，美国统治集团又在公开强调美国有采取“强硬行动”的必要了。在这阵喧嚷里，美国统治集团的有势力的人物，像参议员诺兰、维利、布里奇斯以及美国海军作战部部长卡涅都一齐出了场。诺兰在六月五日发表的演说中就公然要求人们放弃“继续在日内瓦会议上进行谈判”的“极其危险的想法”，并说美国“应该正视一个事实”，
  “那就是美国可能不得不一如它在朝鲜作战那样在印度支那作战”。这些事实难道不是清楚地证明了美国官方机构包括诺兰在内所捏造的那些谎言正是为了给美国直接干涉和扩大印度支那战争制造借口吗？
    正是因为如此，美国统治集团对中苏两国的诽谤就不能不是徒劳的。爱好和平并为自己的民族独立而斗争的亚洲人民及全世界一切正直的人们都看得很清楚，在亚洲力图扩大战争并借此以建立新的殖民统治的不是别人，正是美国统治集团自己。在亚洲以及在全世界的正直人民当中，美国的谎言是没有市场的。甚至最近从远东回到美国的美国国防部长威尔逊也不能不悲哀地承认：“亚洲人民并不认为共产党在印度支那进行侵略”。当然，这种事实不会使美国政府停止撒谎。正相反，它正在按照希特勒的指示行事，希望撒谎撒得大，撒得多，总有一天人家会相信的。但是，希特勒撒了一辈子的谎，现在有什么人相信他呢？
