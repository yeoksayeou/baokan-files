Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 21st: TASS Vienna, June 21st dispatch: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement to the press on Guatemala on the 21st.

The statement said that, acting according to the plans of the American ruling clique, mercenary troops supplied with American arms and aircraft have invaded Guatemalan territory, thus threatening the national independence, social and economic fruits, and democratic freedoms of the Guatemalan people.

The cause of this aggression is that the working people and the people of Guatemala have been struggling for years against the inhumane exploitation and cruel plunder of the American "United Fruit Company."

The statement then said that the U.S. government is openly pressuring the governments of Latin American countries to force them to support its plans to deal with the Guatemalan people by force. At the same time, the U.S. government instigated certain Latin American governments that are completely subservient to the "United Fruit Company" to provoke Guatemala, and supplied them with large quantities of arms, thus creating a hotbed of war in Central America.

The statement concluded: "The World Federation of Trade Unions expresses the feelings of the working masses of the world, expresses deep sympathy to the working people and the people of Guatemala who are fighting for their independence, and extends warm and fraternal greetings to them and their trade unions and peasant organizations.

"The World Federation of Trade Unions hopes that the workers of Guatemala will unite their ranks more closely in the struggle against armed aggression, and consolidate their alliance with the peasants and all the people. The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on trade union organizations and working people in all countries, especially in Latin America, to organize support for the working people and the people of Guatemala, and to support their just struggle against imperialist aggression and to defend their national independence."

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: The people of Latin America condemn the armed aggression against Guatemala supported by U.S. imperialists, and express their support for the just struggle of the people of Guatemala.

The Mexican Communist Party issued a statement on the evening of the 18th, calling on the people of the country to "regard aid to Guatemala as a matter of directly defending the Mexican people." The statement emphasized that the responsibility for the armed aggression against Guatemala lies with the United States. On the 19th, many university students in Mexico visited the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico in batches to express their support for the struggle of the people and government of Guatemala against the forces of aggression. At the request of public opinion, General Hernandez, a representative of the Mexican Ministry of National Defense, told the press that Mexico would oppose the use of Mexican territory as a military base for invading Guatemala.

In Chile, South America, many trade union organizations and youth organizations belonging to various parties have held rallies to support the struggle of the Guatemalan people against the aggressors. A demonstration was held in Santiago on the 19th to protest against U.S. imperialist aggression against Guatemala. The Chilean students participating in the parade shouted slogans such as "Unite our strength, unite our ranks to defeat the aggression against Guatemala." They also burned the American flag in the commercial district of Santiago.

In Cuba, despite police interference, the people still held marches and demonstrations under the slogan of defending Guatemala.

In Argentina, the opposition Radical Party issued a statement calling on the American people to support the Guatemalan people who are fighting a defensive battle against intervention.

    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十一日讯：世界工会联合会书记处二十一日向报界发表关于危地马拉的声明。
    声明说，按照美国统治集团的计划行动，得到美国的军火和飞机供应的雇佣军队侵入了危地马拉领土，因而使危地马拉人民的民族独立、社会和经济果实及民主自由遭到威胁。
    造成这一侵略的原因是：危地马拉的劳动人民和全国人民几年来一直在进行反对美国“联合果品公司”的惨无人道的剥削和残酷的掠夺的斗争。
    声明接着说，美国政府公开对拉丁美洲各国的政府施加压力，强迫它们支持它的用强力对付危地马拉人民的计划。同时，美国政府唆使拉丁美洲某些完全屈从于“联合果品公司”的政府对危地马拉进行挑衅，并供给它们大量的军火，从而在中美造成了一个战争温床。
    声明最后说：“世界工会联合会表达全世界劳动群众的感情，对正在为自己的独立而斗争的危地马拉的劳动人民和全国人民表示深切的同情，向他们和他们的工会和农民组织致热烈的、兄弟的敬礼。
      “世界工会联合会希望，危地马拉的工人们在反抗武装侵略的斗争中，更加紧密地团结自己的队伍，巩固和农民及全体人民的联盟。世界工会联合会号召世界各国的工会组织和劳动人民，特别是拉丁美洲各国的工会起来组织对危地马拉劳动人民和全国人民的声援，声援他们反对帝国主义侵略、保卫自己的民族独立的正义斗争。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】拉丁美洲人民指责在美帝国主义者支持下对危地马拉所进行的武装侵犯，并表示声援危地马拉人民的正义斗争。
    墨西哥共产党在十八日晚上发表声明，号召全国人民把“对危地马拉的援助看作是直接保卫墨西哥人民的事”。声明强调指出：危地马拉遭受武装侵略的责任在于美国。在十九日那天，墨西哥有许多大学生分批访问了危地马拉驻墨西哥大使馆，表示声援危地马拉的人民和政府反对侵略势力的斗争。在舆情的要求下，墨西哥国防部代表埃尔南迪斯将军已对新闻界表示：墨西哥将反对利用墨西哥的领土作为侵入危地马拉的军事基地。
    在南美洲的智利，许多工会组织和属于各种不同党派的青年组织纷纷举行集会，支持危地马拉人民抵抗侵略者的斗争。圣地亚哥城在十九日举行了抗议美帝国主义侵犯危地马拉的示威游行。参加游行的智利学生高呼“联合我们的力量，团结我们的队伍来击败对危地马拉的侵略”的口号。他们并在圣地亚哥的商业区烧掉了美国的国旗。
    在古巴，尽管警察的干涉，但是人民仍然在保卫危地马拉的口号下举行了游行示威。
    在阿根廷，在野的激进党发表声明，要求美国人民声援正在反对干涉、进行防御战斗的危地马拉人民。
