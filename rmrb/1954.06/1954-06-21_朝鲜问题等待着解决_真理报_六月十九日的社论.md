The Geneva Conference concluded its discussions on the Korean question. Throughout the conference, the delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea maintained initiative, proposing clear plans for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

However, the conference did not reach an agreement on the Korean question because the U.S. delegation and the representatives of other countries participating in the Korean War, who followed it, obstructed the final decision on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

It was the United States and its allies in the Korean War who initiated the termination of discussions on this extremely important issue. They issued a declaration stating their refusal to continue negotiations at the Geneva Conference. This clearly exposed that the United States, along with several other countries participating in the U.S. intervention in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, were unwilling to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean question in any way.

From the outset, the United States attempted to use the Geneva Conference to extend the anti-people Syngman Rhee regime to North Korea. They wanted to obtain in Geneva what they had failed to seize by force during the brutal three-year war. The aggressors, threatening a resumption of the war, vainly attempted to obtain favorable conditions for themselves and impose the anti-people, utterly corrupt, and semi-fascist Syngman Rhee regime on North Korea.

When this policy “from a position of strength” failed in Geneva, the U.S. delegation made every effort to undermine the discussion of the Korean question. To this end, it adopted a tactic of obstruction. This tactic involved the U.S. delegation rejecting all suggestions from the delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union without offering any proposals of its own that would demonstrate its sincerity in reaching an agreement.

As early as April 27th, the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, put forward proposals for restoring Korean national unity and holding free all-Korean elections. These proposals were based on the premise that the peaceful resolution of the Korean question should be a matter for the Korean people themselves. Holding free all-Korean elections based on the free expression of the will of all Korean residents should be the most important step in practically achieving national unity. To this end, the proposals put forward by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stipulated the establishment of an all-Korean committee composed of representatives from North and South Korea, and drafting a draft of the all-Korean election law would be one of the committee’s primary tasks. The proposals also stipulated the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korean territory before the elections, which is one of the most important conditions for guaranteeing voters the freedom to express their own will. Finally, the proposals pointed out the need for countries with the greatest concern for maintaining peace in the Far East to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea.

All of these just proposals were rejected by the representatives of the countries participating in the U.S. armed intervention in Korea.

As for the delegations of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they continued their efforts to seek a mutually agreeable agreement in the spirit of consolidating peace in Korea. In particular, the supplementary proposal put forward by Zhou Enlai on May 22nd regarding the establishment of a commission composed of representatives of neutral countries to monitor the free all-Korean elections was of great significance.

However, this proposal was also rejected by the U.S. delegation and its allies in aggression. In an effort to obstruct the achievement of a mutually agreeable agreement, they countered the reasonable proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by demanding that the United Nations monitor the all-Korean elections. This demand was clearly unacceptable because the United Nations was in the position of one of the belligerents, especially since it had long lost the possibility of acting as an impartial international organization and could no longer play an objective role in resolving the Korean question.

On June 5th, the Soviet delegation put forward proposals aimed at bringing the views of the participants closer and facilitating agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov suggested the adoption of a resolution stating that the participants in the Geneva Conference had reached agreement on the following issues: free elections would be held throughout the territory of Korea within six months; in order to prepare and conduct free all-Korean elections and promote reconciliation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, an all-Korean body composed of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea should be established; all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea; an appropriate international commission should be established to monitor the holding of free all-Korean elections; and countries most concerned with maintaining peace in the Far East need to undertake obligations to guarantee the peaceful development of Korea, thereby promoting the solution of the issue of national reunification of Korea.

Adopting this proposal would have facilitated further progress at the Geneva Conference and enabled further exchange of views and agreement on disputed issues. The Soviet proposal received the full support of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. However, the countries participating in the U.S. war of aggression in Korea under the banner of the United Nations once again rudely refused to give concrete consideration to this proposal.

Thus, the discussions on the Korean question at the Geneva Conference clearly demonstrated two policy lines. One is the line of guaranteeing the free development of the peoples of Asia on the basis of national independence and national autonomy; the other is the line of clinging to the outdated colonial privileges in Asia, which are resolutely resisted by the peoples of Asia.

From the entire process of discussions at the Geneva Conference, it is clear that the Korean question can only be effectively resolved by taking into account the legitimate interests of the Korean people themselves. It is no longer possible to impose the will of the colonizers on the heads of those who heroically defend their national independence. The ruling groups of certain imperialist countries should now understand that no "policy of strength" can turn back the wheel of history. The peoples of Asia are very determined to open a path to permanent national independence and democratic development.

The situation of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean question illustrates that the peaceful resolution of the Korean question depends first and foremost on the attitude of the United States. If the United States' policy on the Korean question continues to depend on the military plans of some generals who do not fully understand the pressing need for democratic reforms in Asian countries, then such a policy will not contribute to the resolution of the Korean question and will inevitably end in bankruptcy.

The Soviet Union, on the Korean question as well as on other international issues, has strived to defend the interests of peace and the interests of the free development of all peoples. While the ruling groups of the United States and some other countries are attempting to use the Korean question to exacerbate tensions in the Far East and establish military blocs of colonial countries, the Soviet Union advocates a peaceful resolution of the Korean question and insists on the interests of collective security of all countries.

The United States obstructed the resolution of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference. The last meeting to discuss the Korean question particularly illustrated the tactics of the United States; at this meeting, certain differences were shown between the U.S. delegation and the delegations of certain other Western countries. When the head of the U.S. delegation saw that certain representatives of Western countries agreed with the proposals put forward by the People's Republic of China at the last meeting, he immediately reprimanded them rudely and forced them to retract what they had said. Certain figures in the United States are attempting to use the interruption of the resolution of the Korean question to prove: isn’t it so? Consultations are not in line with the current situation, and we should more resolutely pursue a "policy of strength." The Geneva Conference's work to resolve the Korean question had not yet ended, and representatives of the South Korean puppet regime rushed to make provocative remarks at a press conference, saying that the Korean Armistice Agreement had failed, which in reality was shouting to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea again. These words show the dire consequences of the interruption of the Geneva Conference's work to resolve the Korean question.

However, no matter how the U.S. imperialists and their agents shout, no matter how they intensify the "Cold War," they cannot force the peoples of Asia to abandon their own vital rights for the greedy interests of the colonizers.

The people of the whole world must strive with greater effort for the peaceful unification of Korea and for the final resolution of the Korean question.

As for the Soviet Union's position on the Korean question, it has been clearly expressed by the Soviet delegation in Geneva. This position is based on the premise that any disputes in current international relations, no matter how difficult they may be, should be resolved by peaceful means. The Soviet Union is in favor of convening such an international conference, in which the representatives of all countries enjoy equal rights and are sincerely engaged in work that is conducive to easing international tensions and constantly seeking peaceful ways to resolve disputes. Following this policy, the Soviet Union actively participated in the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference not long ago and put forward proposals that could effectively solve some international problems.

Following this policy, the Soviet Union is now actively participating in the Geneva Conference.

The People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have actively fought together with the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference for the resolution of the Korean question. The People's Republic of China attended the conference as a great power enjoying equal rights. This is a historically significant fact.

After the Western countries interrupted the discussion of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference, they attempted to submit the Korean question to the United Nations for discussion. This is in effect an attempt to prevent the People's Republic of China from participating in the resolution of the Korean question. Everyone knows that the People's Republic of China is still being deprived of its legitimate status in the United Nations. However, the entire process of the Geneva Conference shows that it is impossible to resolve the Korean question without the participation of the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet Union was, is, and will continue to be on the side of the democratic forces of the Korean people who demand the early unification of the Korean state into an independent and democratic country. The Soviet Union was, is, and will continue to be on the side of the democratic forces of Korea and other countries that demand further guarantees of peaceful conditions for Korea's development.

There is no doubt that, no matter what conspiracies the enemies of peace may have, the joint efforts of the forces of peace will inevitably lead to a just resolution of the Korean question, transforming Korea from armistice to peace and restoring the national unification of Korea.

This is urgently needed in order to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

The Korean question still awaits resolution!

    朝鲜问题等待着解决
    ——“真理报”六月十九日的社论
    日内瓦会议结束了关于朝鲜问题的讨论。苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国三国代表团在会议的整个过程中始终保持主动，提出了和平解决朝鲜问题的明确方案。
    但是，会议没有就朝鲜问题达成协议，因为美国代表团以及追随它的其他参加侵朝战争的国家的代表，阻挠作出最终和平解决朝鲜问题的决定。
    倡议结束关于这个极端重要的问题的讨论的是美国和它的参加侵朝战争的盟国。他们发表了一篇宣言，表示他们拒绝在日内瓦会议上继续谈判。这样就明显地暴露了：美国以及在联合国旗帜下参加美国对朝鲜的干涉的其他若干国家，不愿意在任何程度上促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    美国从一开始就企图利用日内瓦会议来把反人民的李承晚政权扩展到北朝鲜。他们想在日内瓦得到在残酷的三年战争中用武力没有夺到手的东西。侵略者以恢复战争为要挟，妄图取得有利于自己的条件，把反人民的、腐朽透顶的、半法西斯的李承晚政权强加于北朝鲜。
    当这种“从实力地位出发”的政策在日内瓦没有成功时，美国代表团就竭力来破坏朝鲜问题的讨论。为此，它采取了阻挠策略。这种策略就是：美国代表团拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联三国代表团的一切建议，而又不提出它自己的任何可以表明它有达成协议诚意的建议。
    早在四月二十七日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日就提出了关于恢复朝鲜国家统一和举行全朝鲜自由选举的建议。这些建议的出发点是：用和平方式解决朝鲜问题应该是朝鲜人民自己的事情。在全朝鲜居民自由表示他们的意志的基础上举行全朝鲜的选举，应当是实际实现国家统一的最重要的一个步骤。为了这个目的，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团所提出的建议规定建立一个由南北朝鲜的代表组成的全朝鲜委员会，草拟全朝鲜选举法草案将是这个委员会的首要任务之一。建议中并规定在进行选举前撤退朝鲜领土上的一切外国军队，这是保证选民自由表示他们的自己意志的最重要的条件之一。最后，建议中指出了对维护远东和平具有最大关心的各国保证朝鲜的和平发展的必要性。
    所有这些公正的建议，都被参加美国对朝鲜的武装干涉的各国的代表所拒绝。
    至于苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表团，他们本着巩固朝鲜和平的愿望，继续努力以谋求达成大家都同意的协议。特别是五月二十二日周恩来所提出的关于成立由中立国的代表组成的委员会来对全朝鲜自由选举进行监察的补充建议，是有着重要意义的。
    然而这项建议也被美国以及它的在进行侵略中的盟国的代表团所拒绝。他们竭力企图阻碍取得大家都同意的协议，提出了由联合国来监察全朝鲜选举的要求来反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的合理的建议。这种要求显然是不能被接受的，因为联合国处于交战一方的地位。尤其是因为它早已失去作为不偏不倚的国际组织的可能，并且在解决朝鲜问题时已不能起客观的作用。
    六月五日，苏联代表团提出了目的在于使会议的参加者的观点获得接近并易于达成协议的建议。苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫建议通过一项决议，在其中说明日内瓦会议的参加者已就下列问题达成协议：在六个月内在全朝鲜领土上举行自由选举；为准备和进行全朝鲜自由选举，并促进朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国之间的和解，应建立由朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和大韩民国代表组成的全朝鲜机构；一切外国军队撤出朝鲜；成立适当的国际委员会来监察全朝鲜自由选举的举行；对维护远东和平最有关系的国家有必要承担义务，来保证朝鲜的和平发展，以此促进朝鲜全国统一问题的解决。
    采纳这项建议就会有利于日内瓦会议的进一步进展，就能继续就争执问题交换意见并达成协议。苏联的建议得到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的完全支持。但是，参加打着联合国旗帜的美国侵朝战争的国家，又一次粗暴地拒绝对这项建议加以具体研究。
    由此可见，日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题的讨论，十分明显地表现出了两条政策路线。一条是保证亚洲人民在民族独立、国家自主的基础上自由发展的路线；另外一条是要在亚洲死抱着受到亚洲人民坚决反抗的已过时的殖民国家特权的路线。
    从日内瓦会议全部讨论过程来看，只有考虑到朝鲜人民本身的合法利益，才能使朝鲜问题得到有效的解决。现在已不可能把殖民者的意志强加在那些英勇地捍卫自己民族独立的人民的头上了。某些帝国主义国家的统治集团现在应该明白：任何“实力政策”已不能再使历史的车轮倒退。亚洲人民十分坚决地要打开一条通往永久的民族独立和民主发展的道路。
    日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题的情况说明，朝鲜问题的和平解决首先要看美国的态度。如果美国对朝鲜问题的政策今后还是取决于一些完全不理解亚洲各国迫切需要的民主改革的将军们的军事计划，那末这种政策是不会促成朝鲜问题的解决，也不会不以破产告终的。
    苏联在朝鲜问题上，也和在其他国际问题上一样，是尽力保卫和平的利益和各国人民自由发展的利益的。美国和其他一些国家的统治集团企图利用朝鲜问题来使远东的紧张局势加剧并建立殖民国家的军事集团，而苏联则主张和平解决朝鲜问题并坚持各国人民集体安全的利益。
    美国阻挠了在日内瓦会议上解决朝鲜问题。讨论朝鲜问题的最后一次会议特别说明了美国的策略，在这次会议上表现出美国代表团和其他一些西方国家代表团之间的某些分歧。当美国代表团团长看到，西方国家某些代表同意中华人民共和国在最后一次会议上提出的建议时，他立即就粗暴地对他们加以申斥，并迫使他们收回自己所说过的话。美国某些人物企图利用中断解决朝鲜问题来证明：可不是吗？协商是不符合目前的局势的，应该更加坚决地推行“实力政策”。日内瓦会议讨论朝鲜问题还没有结束，南朝鲜傀儡政权代表就连忙在记者招待会上发表挑衅性的言论，说朝鲜停战协定失效了，实际上这也就是在叫嚣要再度进犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。这种话表明了日内瓦会议解决朝鲜问题的工作的中断的恶劣后果。
    但是，美帝国主义者和他们的代理人无论怎样叫嚣，无论怎样加紧“冷战”，都不能逼使亚洲人民为了殖民者的贪婪的利益而放弃自己的切身权利。
    全世界人民还要以更大的努力来为朝鲜的和平统一、为最后解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
    至于苏联对朝鲜问题的立场，已由苏联代表团在日内瓦十分明显地表示出来了。这种立场的出发点是：目前国际关系中的任何纠纷，无论它是怎样的困难，都应该是能以和平方式求得解决的。苏联赞成召开这样一种国际会议，在这种会议上，各国的代表享有平等的权利，大家真心诚意地从事有利于缓和国际紧张局势的工作，不断地寻求解决争执问题的和平途径。苏联遵循着这一方针，在不久以前积极地参加了柏林四国外长会议，并提出了能使一些国际问题得到有效解决的建议。
    苏联遵循着这一方针，现在又积极地参加了日内瓦会议。
    中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在日内瓦会议上和苏联共同为解决朝鲜问题而积极地奋斗。中华人民共和国是作为一个享有平等权利的大国而出席会议的。这是一件具有历史意义的事实。
    西方国家在日内瓦会议上中断了朝鲜问题的讨论之后，又企图把朝鲜问题提交联合国讨论。这实际上就是企图不让中华人民共和国参加解决朝鲜问题。大家知道，中华人民共和国直到现在还是被剥夺了它在联合国中的合法地位的。但是，日内瓦会议的整个过程说明，没有中华人民共和国的参加，要解决朝鲜问题是不可能的。
    苏联过去是、今后仍然是站在要求朝鲜国家早日统一为一个独立和民主的国家的朝鲜人民民主力量这一边的。苏联过去是、今后仍然是站在朝鲜以及其他要求进一步为朝鲜的发展保证和平条件的国家的民主力量这一边的。
    毫无疑问，不管和平的敌人要什么阴谋诡计，和平力量的共同努力必然要导致朝鲜问题的公正解决，使朝鲜由停战转入和平并恢复朝鲜的国家统
  一。
      为了维护和巩固全世界和平的利益，迫切需要这样做。
    朝鲜问题还等待着解决！
