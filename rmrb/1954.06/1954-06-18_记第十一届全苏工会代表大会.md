    Record of the 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions
    By our correspondent Li He
    The 11th All-Union Congress of Trade Unions was held from June 7th to 15th. 1,364 delegates attended this congress, representing 40.4 million trade union members. This is a significant increase compared to the 28.5 million members five years ago. This reflects the enormous growth of the working class and Soviet intellectuals accompanying the continuous development of the Soviet economy and culture. This demonstrates the strength of the trade unions under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the enormous growth of the role of the trade unions in communist construction. Thirty-nine percent of the delegates were women. There were many production innovators.
    Following the direction indicated in the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers, and in the spirit of high responsibility and broad criticism and self-criticism, the delegates, without being complacent about the great achievements of the past, actively explored the direction of further developing the role of trade unions as communist schools and combat organizers of the masses. The congress discussed and adopted the summary reports of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and the Central Auditing Commission, and the report on amending the articles of association, and re-elected the Central Council and the Auditing Commission. Of particular importance and most worthy of our attention were the improvement of socialist emulation leadership and the amendment of the articles of association. In the Soviet Union, socialist emulation has already reached a national scale. Soviet trade unions have played a huge role in mobilizing, organizing, and leading socialist emulation. Now that the Soviet Union is vigorously developing all sectors of the national economy and improving the welfare of workers, the role of trade unions is even greater. However, shortcomings in the leadership of socialist emulation had been discovered before the congress. The Party and the government called on trade unions to better launch socialist emulation in all sectors of the national economy. Therefore, this congress attached great importance to improving the leadership of socialist emulation. The principles taught by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the rich experience of Soviet trade unions prove that the most important thing in socialist emulation is to raise the backward to the advanced level; the experience of production innovators is the wealth of the whole people, and promoting these experiences can accelerate communist construction. The reporters and delegates at this congress criticized some economic departments and trade union workers, pointing out that they also talked about advanced experiences, but in reality, they rarely promoted them. For example, Duvanov's rapid brick-making method can double brick production. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry recognized the importance of this advanced experience and issued many instructions, but did not take effective measures to promote it, and the building materials trade union did not strive to change this situation.
    The principles taught by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the rich experience of Soviet trade unions prove that socialist emulation is the living creation of millions of people, and it cannot tolerate any bureaucracy or formalism. Reporters and delegates criticized some enterprises for not conducting meticulous and lively organizational work, but instead being busy producing various reports, notifications, and documents, with numerous competitions being held simultaneously in the workshops. For example, each workshop in the Moscow Machine Manufacturing Plant had to submit twenty-two types of forms to the plant department every month, of which one form alone required four hundred lines to be filled in monthly. Delegates criticized the fact that when summarizing the All-Union Socialist Emulation, only advanced enterprises were selected for awards, without paying attention to and helping backward enterprises. Delegates also demanded that leading staff of trade unions should have closer contact with advanced workers in production, as this is a necessary condition for leading socialist emulation well.
    The tasks instructed by the Soviet Communist Party and the government and the work experience of Soviet trade unions in recent years have all been summarized into the new articles of association, which form the foundation of the trade union organization. According to the report on amending the articles of association, the following addition was made to the introduction of the new articles of association: "Trade unions unite workers and staff around the Party, mobilize them to fight for the construction of a communist society, to continuously improve the material and cultural level of society, and to strengthen the active defense of the Soviet motherland against the aggression of its enemies as much as possible, to educate workers and staff in the spirit of internationalism, and to establish fraternal ties with the laborers of all countries." The introduction also added: "Trade unions actively participate in national construction and economic construction, participate in the formulation of laws on production, labor, life, and cultural issues, and fight for the continuous implementation of these laws."
    The delegates all agreed that the new articles of association should stipulate in more detail that trade unions have the obligation to organize such socialist emulations: "Striving to maximize labor productivity, striving to complete and exceed state plans, striving to continuously develop all sectors of industry, transportation, and agriculture, improving product quality and reducing costs, and striving to fully utilize all the potential of the socialist economy." Delegates emphasized that the work of organizing competitions should be evaluated based on concrete production results. Adhering to the articles of association means resolutely eliminating formalism in the organization of competitions, delving deeper into issues such as technical norms, labor organization, and wages, persistently publicizing and promoting the advanced experiences of innovators, and paying more attention to each producer.
    Soviet trade unions are educational and democratic organizations, so the articles of association made clear additions regarding working methods: "All activities of trade unions are based on the methods of persuading the masses, giving play to the initiative, creativity, and independence of workers and staff. Trade unions have the task of broadly unfolding self-criticism, especially criticism from below, fighting against bureaucracy and shortcomings in work, and attentively listening to the needs and demands of laborers."
    The first obligation of members in the old articles of association was very simple: "Trade union members must strictly abide by state laws and labor discipline." The new articles of association require members not only to abide by labor discipline themselves, but also to fight against phenomena that violate labor discipline: "...fighting against any kind of indiscipline in production, because violating labor discipline will harm the interests of the state." This reflects the high sense of responsibility of Soviet people towards labor discipline.
    The articles of association also made certain revisions regarding the organization and role of trade union organs and grassroots organizations, with the aim of focusing the attention of all trade union workers not on the preparation of resolutions and notices, but on lively organizational work and on checking the implementation of adopted resolutions.
    This congress was filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The World Federation of Trade Unions and delegations from workers and laborers of various countries paid tribute to the congress. On the second day of the congress, Lai Ruoyu, head of the Chinese trade union delegation and chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, entrusted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress and, through the congress, to the great Soviet people who are victoriously building communism, on behalf of the Chinese working class. The delegation also presented a banner to the congress. The entire hall repeatedly cheered and applauded for the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The executive chairman of the congress, Goroshkin, expressed gratitude on behalf of the congress, paid tribute to the Chinese working class, and wished the great Chinese laborers further achievements in socialist construction.

    记第十一届全苏工会代表大会
    本报记者　李何
    第十一届全苏工会代表大会从六月七日举行到十五日。有一千三百六十四名代表参加了这次代表大会。他们代表四千零四十万工会会员。比起五年前二千八百五十万会员来说增长了很多。这反映了随着苏联经济和文化的不断发展而来的工人阶级和苏维埃知识分子的队伍的巨大增长。这表现了在苏联共产党领导之下的工会力量的强大，表现了工会在共产主义建设中作用的巨大增长。代表中有百分之三十九是妇女。有许多生产革新者。
    代表大会根据苏共中央和部长会议的贺电所指示的方向，在代表们高度负责和广泛的批评和自我批评的精神下，不自满于过去的巨大成就，而积极地探讨了今后更加发挥作为共产主义学校和群众的战斗组织者的工会的作用的方针。代表大会讨论和通过了全苏工会中央理事会和中央监察委员会的总结报告，修改会章的报告，改选了中央理事会和监察委员会，其中特别重要和最值得我们注意的是关于社会主义竞赛领导的改进和会章的修改。在苏联，社会主义竞赛已经具有全民的规模。苏联工会在动员、组织和领导社会主义竞赛上起了巨大的作用。现在苏联在大力发展国民经济各部门和提高劳动者的福利，工会的作用更大了。但在大会前已发现社会主义竞赛领导上存在着缺点。党和政府号召工会更好地在国民经济各部门展开社会主义竞赛。因此这次代表大会非常重视改进社会主义竞赛的领导问题。苏联共产党所教导的原则和苏联工会的丰富经验证明：社会主义竞赛中最主要的在于把落后的提高到先进的水平；生产革新者的经验是全民的财富，推广这些经验可以加速共产主义建设。这次代表大会的报告人和代表们批评了一些经济部门和工会工作者，指出了他们对于先进经验也嚷嚷说说，但实际上很少推广。例如杜瓦诺夫的快速烧砖方法可以提高产砖量一倍。建筑材料工业部承认这个先进经验的重要，发了不少指令，但没有采取有效的推广措施，建筑材料工会也没有争取改变这种情况。
    苏联共产党所教导的原则和苏联职工会的丰富经验证明：社会主义竞赛是千百万人的活的创造，它不能忍受任何官僚主义、形式主义。报告人员和代表们批评了有些企业不去细致地进行活的组织工作，而忙于制造各种汇报、通知和文件，在车间中同时进行着名目繁多的竞赛。例如莫斯科机器制造厂各车间每月要交给厂部二十二种形式的表报，其中仅一种表报每月就要填写四百行。代表们批评了这样的事实：在总结全苏社会主义竞赛时，只挑选先进的企业来评奖，而没有注意和帮助落后的企业。代表们也要求工会的领导工作人员同生产先进的工人们更密切地联系，因为这是很好地领导社会主义竞赛的必要条件。
    苏联共产党和政府指示的任务和苏联工会最近几年来的工作经验，都归纳作为工会组织基础的新会章里面。根据修改会章报告、新会章的导言部分作了这样的补充：“工会团结工人和职员在党的周围，动员他们为建设共产主义社会而斗争，为不断提高社会的物质和文化水平和尽量加强苏维埃祖国的积极国防以免受其敌人的侵略而斗争，以国际主义的精神教育工人和职员，并且建立与各国劳动者的兄弟联系。”导言部分也补充说：“工会积极参加国家建设和经济建设，参加制订关于生产、劳动、生活和文化问题的法律，为不断实现这些法律而斗争。”
    代表们都赞成在新会章中更详细地规定工会有义务组织这样的社会主义竞赛：“争取尽量提高劳动生产率，争取完成和超过国家计划，争取不断发展工业各部门、运输业和农业，改善产品质量和降低成本，争取充分利用社会主义经济的一切潜力。”代表们着重指出，组织竞赛的工作要以具体的生产结果来评价。遵守会章就要坚决消除组织竞赛上的形式主义，就要更深入到技术定额、劳动组织和工资等问题中去，就要坚持地宣传和推广革新者的先进经验，更加关注每个生产者。
    苏联工会是教育性质、民主性质的组织，所以会章中关于工作方法作了明确的补充：“工会的一切活动是建立在说服群众、发挥工人和职员的积极性、首创性和独立性的方法的基础之上。工会有任务要广泛地展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，对工作中的官僚主义和缺点进行斗争，关心地倾听劳动者的需要和要求。”
    旧会章关于会员的第一项义务很简单：“工会会员必须严格遵守国家法令和劳动纪律。”新会章要求会员不仅自己遵守劳动纪律，而且要向破坏劳动纪律的现象作斗争：“……向生产中不论什么样的无纪律现象作斗争，因为破坏劳动纪律将损害国家利益。”这反映着苏联人对劳动纪律的高度负责精神。
        关于工会机关和基层组织的机构和作用，会章也作了某些修改，目的是为了使一切工会工作者的注意力不放在编制决议和通告上，而放在活的组织工作上，放在检查被通过的决议的执行上。
    这次代表大会充满了无产阶级国际主义的精神。世界工联和各国工人阶级和劳动者的代表团都向代表大会致敬。大会第二天，中国工会代表团团长、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚受中华全国总工会的委托，代表中国工人阶级，向代表大会并通过大会向胜利地建设共产主义的伟大苏联人民致贺词，代表团并向大会献旗。全场一再为中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊欢呼和鼓掌。大会执行主席戈罗希金以大会名义表示感谢，向中国工人阶级致敬，并且祝伟大的中国全体劳动者在社会主义建设中取得进一步的成就。　　　　　　六月十五日
