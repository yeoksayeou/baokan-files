    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 26th: TASS Moscow, June 25th: On June 24th, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister V.A. Zorin visited Mr. Charles Bohlen, the American ambassador to Moscow, and gave him a note. The contents of the note are as follows:
      "The Soviet government deems it necessary to inform the U.S. government of the following incident.
    On June 23rd, at 4:00 AM local time, the Soviet tanker ‘Tuapse,’ belonging to the Black Sea Shipping Company and loaded with kerosene, was detained in international waters south of Taiwan by a warship of destroyer type. The location was 19 degrees 55 minutes north latitude and 120 degrees 23 minutes east longitude. Under the threat of force, the tanker was forced to change course and follow the warship. After receiving a message from the tanker's captain about the attack on the tanker by a destroyer-type warship, radio contact with the tanker was lost. The fate of this Soviet vessel and its entire crew is now unknown.
    Obviously, the detention of the Soviet tanker by a warship in waters controlled by the U.S. Navy can only be the work of the U.S. Navy.
    The Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will take steps regarding the attack on the Soviet merchant ship in international waters to immediately release the merchant ship, its cargo, and its entire crew. At the same time, the Soviet government firmly demands that the American officials responsible for organizing this illegal action be severely punished, and that measures be taken to prevent similar actions of blatant violation of freedom of navigation on the high seas from recurring.
    The Soviet government considers it necessary to state that it cannot remain indifferent to this intolerable behavior and will have to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of navigation of Soviet merchant ships in that region."
    Bohlen promised to forward the note to the U.S. government.

    苏联政府照会美国政府
    立刻放还被美国海军非法扣留的苏联商船
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日讯：六月二十四日，苏联外交部副部长瓦·亚·佐林访问美国驻莫斯科大使查尔斯·波伦先生，并交给他照会一份。照会内容如下：
      “苏联政府认为有必要把下列事件通知美国政府。
    属于黑海航运公司装载灯油的苏联油船‘图阿普斯’号在六月二十三日当地时间四时，在台湾以南的公海上被一艘驱逐舰型的军舰所扣留，地点是北纬十九度五十五分和东经一百二十度二十三分，油船在武力的威胁下，被迫改变航道，跟随军舰航行。在接到油船船长关于油船受到驱逐舰型军舰的袭击的消息后，和油船的无线电联络就中断了。这艘苏联船只和它的全体船员此后的命运即不得而知。
    显然，苏联油船在美国海军所控制的海面上被军舰扣留一事只能是美国海军所干的。
    苏联政府希望美国政府就苏联商船在公海上受到袭击一事采取步骤，以便立刻放还商船、船上的货物和全体船员。同时，苏联政府坚决要求严惩负责组织这次非法行动的美国官员，并且采取措施，以防可能再度发生悍然侵犯在公海上的航行自由的类似行动。
    苏联政府认为有必要说明，它不能够对这种不能容许的行为采取不过问的态度，并且将不得不采取适当措施以保证苏联商船在那一地区的航行安全。”
    波伦答应把这份照会转交给美国政府。
