Farmers in some areas of Southwest China are battling natural disasters such as drought, flooding, and pests. Party and government organs in various localities are leading farmers in the fight against the primary disasters in their areas. In parts of Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces that have suffered from flooding, Party and government organs are actively leading the masses to replant or change crops. In Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, 95 percent of the disaster-stricken land has been replanted with seedlings. Soil worms have been widely discovered in the major cotton-producing areas throughout the region. Insect pests have occurred in seven special districts of Yunnan Province, and a campaign to eliminate pests and protect seedlings is underway in various places. In Changning County, Sichuan Province, the sixth district head went deep into the pest-infested areas, mobilizing more than 1,600 people to participate in pest elimination, basically eradicating the pests.

While leading the masses in the fight against various natural disasters, various localities are also providing farmers with material support and assistance. The Guizhou Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's more than 230 tons of pesticides have been supplied to farmers at reduced prices by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places. This batch of pesticides can protect more than one million mu of crops from pests and diseases or reduce their impact. In addition, 1 billion yuan worth of pesticides and equipment will be distributed free of charge to farmers in minority areas and remote mountain areas. (Lu Yun)

    西南区农民积极除虫保苗
    西南部分地区发生旱涝病虫等自然灾害，各地党政机关正领导农民向当地主要灾害作斗争。云南、四川、贵州等省部分遭受水害地区，党政机关正积极领导群众补种或改种，贵州省金沙县已有百分之九十五的受灾地补种上秧苗。全区各主要产棉区普遍发现土蚕，云南省有七个专区发生虫害，除虫保苗运动正在各地展开，四川省长宁县六区区长深入虫害区域发动一千六百多人参加除虫，基本上扑灭了虫害。
    各地在领导群众向各种自然灾害作斗争中，并给农民以物质上的支援和帮助，贵州省农林厅二百三十多吨农药已经由各地供销合作社减价供应农民，这批农药可使一百多万亩农作物不受或少受病虫害，另有十亿元的农药和药械将无偿发放给少数民族地区及边远山区的农民。（卢云）
