To the Central People's Government Committee:

    The Drafting Committee of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, based on the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (First Draft)" proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, carried out the drafting work. From March 23 to June 11, it lasted 81 days. In addition to holding multiple informal meetings to collect and exchange opinions, it held seven formal meetings. After detailed and thorough research and discussion, the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" was adopted. During the drafting process, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the leading organs of major administrative regions, provinces and cities, the local organizations of democratic parties and people's organizations, and the leading organs of the armed forces, organized more than 8,000 people from all walks of life to participate in the discussion of the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China (First Draft)." More than 5,900 revision suggestions were put forward in the discussion. Many of these suggestions were useful and gave great help to the drafting work. The "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" adopted by the Drafting Committee is divided into five parts: "Preamble," "General Principles," "State Organs," "Fundamental Rights and Duties of Citizens," and "National Flag, National Emblem, and Capital"; excluding the "Preamble," it consists of a total of 106 articles. We believe that this "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" is appropriate. Now, we submit this draft to the Central People's Government Committee for review and approval, and request that it be published after approval, and that discussions be organized among the people nationwide to collect opinions for further revision, and to submit a report on the draft constitution to the First Session of the First National People's Congress.
