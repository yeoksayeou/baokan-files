Organizing Production Coordination is an Important Way to Improve the Production Capacity of the Machinery Industry

    I.

    Since last year, the machinery industry departments in East China, Northeast China, and Southwest China have started to develop production coordination among factories in a planned and organized manner. The basic content of this production coordination is to organize many enterprises with different leadership systems, different natures, and different production capacities within a certain region, under the leadership of the local relevant leading departments, to give full play to their strengths and jointly complete a certain production task according to the needs of the country.

    The development of production coordination in the machinery industry is an important development in China's machinery industry production activities.

    In recent years, with the restoration and development of the country's economic undertakings, China's machinery industry has also undergone complex transformation work, that is, turning enterprises that were mainly engaged in repair and assembly into enterprises that are mainly engaged in manufacturing; and gradually implementing professional division of labor according to needs for enterprises with complex production content and a lack of professional division of labor in the past. This is completely necessary to improve the production capacity of the machinery industry, because only in this way can these enterprises make the fullest use of equipment capacity, adopt the latest technological achievements, greatly improve labor productivity and reduce product costs, and finally get rid of the various weaknesses left over by colonial industry. However, with the increasing specialization of the machinery industry and the increasing complexity of technology, it is inevitable that the industry must correspondingly strengthen connections and coordination. It is certainly impossible to improve the production capacity of the machinery industry without gradually implementing professional division of labor, but professional division of labor must be built on the basis of high-level coordination and cooperation. They are interconnected and mutually influential. The development of specialization and the separation of new industrial sectors require that the production links and cooperation between departments and enterprises must be strengthened day by day; and the development of production cooperation provides conditions for further specialization. Therefore, production cooperation is put on our production agenda, which is the inevitable result of the development of China's machinery industry production.

    Production cooperation has more practical significance for improving the current situation of China's machine manufacturing industry. At present, on the one hand, due to the vigorous development of the country's construction undertakings, the production capacity and technical level of the machine industry are far from meeting the needs of various sectors of the national economy. The country needs many complete sets of products and various precision and high-quality machinery and equipment, but we cannot fully manufacture them to meet the needs of the country. On the other hand, due to historical reasons, the capacity of enterprises in China's machine industry is extremely unbalanced. Generally, small machine tools are abundant, while large and precision equipment are lacking; and some enterprises have surplus capacity for large and precision equipment. These factories are widely distributed, and there has been a long-term lack of close contact and cooperation in production; coupled with other reasons, this has created the current serious contradiction in the production of the machine industry: on the one hand, it is "unable to eat" (not keeping up with the needs of the country), and at the same time, it is "not full" (enterprises have a large amount of surplus production capacity that has not been utilized). According to incomplete statistics, last year, about one-third of the machine tools in state-owned machine factories across the country were not fully utilized. To change this serious contradiction in the current machine industry production in our country, we need to do a lot of work, but the fact that East China and other regions organize production cooperation tells us that organizing different enterprises to carry out production cooperation in a planned way is one of the most practical and effective ways to tap the huge potential capacity of the machine industry and solve the contradiction between national needs and insufficient capacity of the machine industry.

    II.

    Organizing production cooperation has a significant role in promoting the development of the machinery industry. Judging from the initial achievements made in organizing production cooperation in East China, Northeast China, Southwest China, and other regions, its role is mainly reflected in:

    First, organizing production cooperation can improve the existing technical level of enterprises, and on this basis, manufacture complete sets of machinery and equipment and various important new products to ensure the needs of complete sets of equipment for key construction projects and equipment modification of existing enterprises, and promote the development of production undertakings.

    During the first five-year plan period, China will carry out the construction of 141 key projects with the assistance of the Soviet Union. The main equipment for these projects is supplied by the Soviet government, but many of the equipment need to be manufactured domestically. And the equipment for construction projects other than the 141 projects is mainly manufactured domestically. This is an extremely vast task for the machine manufacturing industry during the first five-year plan period. These tens of thousands of new equipment and new products with high quality requirements, from translating drawings, or carrying out product design, material supply, product trial production, to mass production, the work is extremely complex. However, China's machine manufacturing industry has a backward technical level and uneven equipment distribution. It is impossible for one enterprise or a few enterprises to complete the manufacturing of these new products. Only by organizing extensive cooperation and mutual support and cooperation can this difficulty be overcome and the purpose of mastering new technologies and increasing new varieties be achieved. For example, China urgently needs complete sets of hydropower equipment, but it could not be manufactured domestically in the past. Last year, several factories organized to implement production cooperation. Harbin Electric Motor Factory manufactured generators, Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory manufactured turbines, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory manufactured rotors in turbines, Anshan Iron and Steel Company Machinery General Factory manufactured large shafts, and Fushun Heavy Machinery Factory manufactured flanges. As a result, ten sets of hydropower equipment were finally manufactured, supplying the Foziling Reservoir Hydropower Station in the Huaihe River and construction projects in Yunnan, Fujian, and other places. Because complete sets of products can be manufactured through cooperation, it is also possible to change the phenomenon that the relevant product specifications of various factories are inconsistent and cannot be assembled into complete sets of equipment, resulting in product backlog.

    On the other hand, during the first five-year plan period, the equipment of many old factories and mines in our country must also be transformed in a planned manner, gradually changing manual labor operations to mechanization, improving enterprise operating conditions, balancing the machine equipment capacity of enterprises, etc., to improve the production capacity of these enterprises. This is another major task for the machine manufacturing industry during the period of national industrialization. This is also a very complex task, which requires organizing many enterprises to cooperate in order to complete it.

    Second, organizing production cooperation can remedy the shortcomings of unbalanced capacity within the machinery industry, overcome weak links, and enable the surplus production capacity of enterprises to be reasonably used and developed, and improve the equipment utilization rate and labor productivity of enterprises.

    China's machinery industry is now in the transformation stage from being mainly engaged in repair and assembly to being mainly engaged in manufacturing. State planning work and enterprise production management work are not yet perfect. Therefore, the production tasks and production varieties in enterprises are still frequently changed, and the unbalanced phenomenon of being busy at times and idle at times inevitably occurs in production, making it impossible to fully utilize the production capacity of enterprises. Organizing production cooperation can greatly improve this situation. For example, from October to December last year, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory had more than 10,000 hours of planned workload without equipment to do each month, and the completion of production tasks was threatened, while the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory and other factories had lathes idle at this time. Later, several enterprises cooperated to enable the Diesel Engine Factory to smoothly complete its production plan and increase the production of 60 sets of oil pumps to support the Qiuxin Shipyard, and the idle equipment of the Xinzhong Power Factory and other factories was also fully utilized.

    Third, implementing production cooperation can quickly gather the strength of various enterprises, so that many key major problems encountered in industrial production, or temporary urgent production tasks, can be solved smoothly and quickly. For example, the lack of spare parts and pinions in the Northeast mining machinery seriously threatened the production of mines and had not been resolved for a long time. Last year, the Northeast factories adopted the method of production cooperation, and carried out specific division of labor according to the size of the potential of various equipment in each factory. Factory A made models, Factory B cast, and Factory C processed, so that the spare parts and pinions urgently needed by the mines were smoothly resolved. Such problems will often occur in our industrial production activities, and their impact is often very large. For example, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory failed to complete its production plan for fifteen consecutive months due to production problems, affecting the failure of more than 40 construction units across the country to start construction on schedule. And such problems can only be solved by gathering the strength of many enterprises through the form of cooperation. The problem of Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory was later solved by the local state-owned factories in Liaoyang and other factories in Lushun quickly gathering strength to cooperate, and the state plan was completed five days ahead of schedule.

    Fourth, in some areas, in the organization of production cooperation, under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, joint state-private and private machinery industries were absorbed to participate together, so that the production of joint state-private and private machinery factories was more effectively incorporated into the track of the state plan, and the socialist transformation of private enterprises was accelerated.

    In addition, production cooperation can also solve many other problems, such as mutual technical support and exchange of technical experience between enterprises. Different enterprises can have different cooperation contents. With the development of cooperation work, the content in this area will undoubtedly be infinitely enriched in the future.

    III.

    Production cooperation has opened up a broad road for further tapping the huge potential within China's machinery industry. It does not require the state to increase investment, but it can create huge amounts of wealth for society. But this is a very complex and detailed organizational work. It is still a very unfamiliar topic for us.

    There are two main types of production cooperation in the machinery industry. One is cooperation mainly based on regions. This kind of cooperation is often organized to use the surplus capacity of local factories, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and carry out production according to a certain temporary task. There is no fixed long-term production relationship between the enterprises, and the cooperative relationship changes with the changes in product varieties and the increase or decrease of tasks, as well as new situations that occur in production. The form of cooperation is flexible and diverse. This type of cooperation accounts for the majority of production cooperation in East China and other places. Its advantage is that because they are all in one region, problems can be solved quickly and timely, and there is no need for long-distance transportation. In the organization of production cooperation, this regional cooperation is an important form that cannot be ignored. In the past, some departments in the machinery industry were unwilling to carry out cooperation within their own business system due to departmentalism, and were unwilling to first achieve balance in the region, which caused many losses to the country. For example, a factory in Fushun urgently needed screws and steel frames for construction projects. At that time, cooperation was arranged according to the business system. As a result, it was assigned to produce in Guizhou, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou. The factory in Guizhou was more than 200 miles away from the railway. The 11-meter-long steel frame had to be cut off by electric fire before it could be transported by car, and then welded back after arriving at the destination. This not only wasted transportation capacity, but also affected product quality, while these screws and steel frames could have been produced in cooperation in other enterprises in Northeast China at that time. For example, last year, the Northeast Electric Engineering Ten Factory needed a Lancashire boiler. The Electric Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry of the Central Committee organized cooperation within the bureau's system, requiring the Electric Engineering Nine Factory to design and manufacture it from scratch, which took a long time, while the Machinery Seventeen Factory, which did not belong to the bureau but had been manufacturing this type of boiler for many years, did not receive an order. There are many similar examples, so future production cooperation should first strive for regional balance, and avoid any wasteful practices that emphasize departmental interests and cause long-distance transportation or two-way transportation.

    Another type of production cooperation is cooperation mainly based on departments. With the development of machinery industry production, the division of labor between factories is becoming increasingly clear. To produce complete sets and complex products, each factory cannot complete it alone, but needs to obtain some parts or semi-finished products from other factories. Such as the cooperation and coordination between machinery and electrical machinery, the cooperation and coordination between machinery and power machines, etc. This type of cooperative relationship is not like the previous type, but is relatively long-term and fixed. As long as the product is fixed, the cooperative relationship is also fixed. This type of production cooperation is generally carried out within the department, and it is a very important form of production cooperation implemented by the machinery industry.

    In short, both regional cooperation and departmental cooperation are forms that cannot be ignored. These two forms should be flexibly used according to the state's plan and the principle of combining balance between the competent system and regional balance. When organizing departmental cooperation (i.e., system cooperation), regional cooperation should be considered first; when organizing regional cooperation, departmental cooperation should also be considered. For example, when organizing regional cooperation, enterprises in the same department in the region should be organized to cooperate first; when organizing departmental cooperation, enterprises in the same department in the same region should be organized to cooperate first.

    Strengthening organizational leadership is an important link to ensure the further development of production cooperation at present. The regional financial and economic committees and relevant industrial departments should implement a clear division of labor and cooperation. To ensure the implementation of cooperation, specialized institutions can be formed, using the form of contracts and agreements, and gradually incorporating cooperation into a regular and institutionalized track. At present, the development of production cooperation work is still very uneven in various places. Even in some cities with a very concentrated machinery industry, regional cooperation has not yet been carried out in a planned way, and cooperation plans have not been generally included in the production plans of departments and bureaus. Due to the imperfect organizational work, the equipment orders of newly built enterprises requiring cooperation are often "submitted late and required urgently," so that the manufacturing factory cannot fully carry out production preparation work, which affects the smooth progress of production cooperation.

    The organization of production cooperation is basically still in the exploration stage. It still needs us to continuously enrich it and supplement it in practice so that it can become more perfect.

    IV.

    Production cooperation has put forward serious tasks in ideological work. Many facts show that departmentalism and isolationist viewpoints are the biggest ideological enemies of production cooperation. Some of our enterprises, especially comrades in large enterprises, only want to turn the factory they lead into a "universal factory," "I don't ask for help from others, and others don't ask for help from me." They would rather let the equipment in the factory sit idle than cooperate with others. Some enterprises treat cooperation with a "do less is better than do more" attitude, regarding cooperation as "troublesome" and refusing with various excuses, and even put forward conditions such as "no profit, no work," "no ready-made materials, no work," "complex nature, no work," and "small quantity, no work." Some factories pay too much attention to the "interests" of their own units, and do not realize the important significance of cooperating with key projects and actively cooperating. Some only want their own factories to "give full play to their potential" and go around looking for work to complete their own factory's "output value plan," but are unwilling to cooperate with the needs of nearby key projects. All these thoughts and behaviors reflect that the comrades in these enterprises lack an overall concept and economic knowledge of modern industry. They should know that production is social production at any time and under any conditions. People must have certain connections and cooperation in production activities, otherwise production will not be possible. And modern industry has developed the connections in production to a higher stage, which requires a higher degree of cooperation and collaboration. The isolationist viewpoint of "not asking for help from anyone" and "everyone sweeps the snow from their own door" is essentially a reflection of the natural economy of individual farmers and small handicraftsmen, and it is incompatible with the collectivist ideology of socialist large-scale industry. As for the idea of being unwilling to cooperate for the needs of key projects, it is of course even more wrong. Supporting national industrialization, first of all, is to support key projects (the foundation of national industrialization). This is the most important task of the machinery industry. We must oppose this isolationist viewpoint and departmentalism, and advocate the idea of proceeding from the overall interests of the country and actively cooperating and collaborating with other enterprises to carry out production cooperation.

    The above-mentioned chaotic thinking on the issue of cooperation also reflects the weakness of the party's political and ideological work in enterprises and the lack of research on industrial economic knowledge by enterprise leaders. Therefore, strengthening ideological work is an urgent task. The party committees of relevant economic organs and regional party committees should raise the issue of cooperation to the height of political principle, and include it as an important part of the political and ideological work of enterprises, and continuously educate the management personnel of grassroots enterprises in the machinery industry, so that they clearly recognize that ensuring the supply of equipment for key projects and transforming the old equipment of existing enterprises is the glorious task of the machinery industry to realize national industrialization, and it is also a concrete measure for the machinery industry to increase varieties and tap potential. It is necessary to actively solve the difficulties and problems for key projects, and overcome the incorrect thinking of regarding key project orders as "troublesome" and "money-losing" work. Enterprise leaders should tirelessly and systematically study industrial knowledge, especially the experience of Soviet socialist industrial construction, and eliminate various erroneous ideas that are harmful to the cause of national construction, such as departmentalism and local viewpoints.

    组织生产协作是提高机械工业生产能力的重要途径
    季音
    一
    华东、东北和西南等地区的机械工业部门，从去年开始，分别有领导有计划地展开了各厂相互之间的生产协作。这种生产协作的基本内容，就是根据国家的需要，在一定地区内，由当地的有关领导部门把许多不同领导系统、不同性质、不同生产能力的企业组织起来，各展所长，共同完成某项生产任务。
    机械工业生产协作的开展，是我国机械工业生产活动中一个重要的发展。
    几年来随着国家经济事业的恢复和发展，我国机械工业也进行了复杂的改造工作，即把过去以修配为主的企业转向以制造为主的企业；把过去生产内容庞杂的、缺乏专业分工的企业，逐步根据需要实行专业分工。这对于提高机械工业的生产能力是完全必要的，因为只有这样，才能使这些企业最充分地利用设备能力，采用最新的技术成就，大大地提高劳动生产率和降低产品的成本，并最后地摆脱殖民地工业遗留下来的各种弱点。但是，随着机械工业分工日益专业化和技术日益复杂的同时，就必然要求工业内部必须相应地加强联系和协作。不逐步实行专业分工，固然不可能提高机械工业的生产能力，但是专业分工必须建筑在高度协作配合的基础上，它们是相互联系，相互影响的。专业化的发展，新工业部门的分离，要求部门间与企业间生产的联系和协作必须日益加强；而生产协作的发展又为进一步实行专业化提供了条件。所以生产协作被提到我们的生产日程上来，正是我国机械工业生产发展的必然结果。
    生产协作对于改善我国机器制造工业的现状更有着现实的意义。我国目前机器制造工业一方面由于国家建设事业的蓬勃发展，机器工业的生产能力和技术水平远远不能满足国民经济各部门的需要。国家需要许多成套性的产品和各种精密的、质量高的机器设备，但我们却不能充分制造以满足国家的需要。但另一方面，我国机器工业由于历史的原因，企业内部的能力极不平衡，一般的是小型机床富裕，大型和精密设备缺乏；而有的企业大型、精密设备的能力又有剩余。这些工厂又分布很广，相互之间生产上长期缺乏密切的联系和配合；再加上其他种种原因，因此造成了今天机器工业的生产一方面是“吃不了”（赶不上国家的需要），而同时又“吃不饱”（企业有大量富余的生产能力没有利用）。据不完全的统计，去年全国国营机器工厂中没有充分利用的机床，约占全部机床的三分之一。要改变我国当前机器工业生产中的这种严重矛盾，我们需要作许多的工作，但华东等地区组织生产协作的事实告诉我们：有计划地组织不同企业进行生产协作，正是发挥机器工业大量的潜在能力，解决国家需要与机器工业能力不足这一矛盾的最实际有效的方法之一。
    二
    组织生产协作对于促进机械工业的发展具有重大的作用。我们从华东、东北、西南等地区组织生产协作所取得的初步成绩中来看，它的作用主要表现在：
    第一，组织生产协作，能够使企业现有的技术水平提高一步，并在这一基础上制造成套的机器设备和各种重要的新产品，以保证重点建设工程配套设备和现有企业设备改装的需要，促进生产事业的发展。
    我国在第一个五年计划期间，将要在苏联援助下进行一百四十一项重点工程的建设。这些工程的主要设备是由苏联政府供应的，但其中有不少的设备要在国内制造。而一百四十一项以外的工程建设，其设备更主要是由国内制造的。这是机器制造工业在第一个五年计划期间的一个极为浩繁的任务。这些数以万计的、质量要求很高的新设备和新产品，从翻译图纸，或进行产品设计，材料供应，产品试制，到大量生产，其中的工作极为复杂。但是我国机器制造工业技术水平落后，设备分布很不平衡，一个企业或少许企业不可能完成这些新产品的制造，只有组织广泛的协作，相互支援相互配合，才可能克服这个困难，达到掌握新技术和增加新品种的目的。例如我国目前急需整套的水力发电设备，但过去国内不能制造，去年好几个厂组织起来实行生产协作，哈尔滨电机厂制造发电机，沈阳高压开关厂制造透平，沈阳重型机器厂制造透平中的转子，鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂制造大轴，抚顺重型机械厂制造法兰盘，结果终于制造完成了十套水力发电的设备，供应了淮河佛子岭水库水电站和云南、福建等地的建设工程。由于通过协作能够制造成套性的产品，也就可能改变过去各厂有关产品规格不一致，不能装配成套设备而使产品积压的现象。
    另一方面，在第一个五年计划期间，我国许多旧有工厂矿山的设备也要有计划的实行改造，把体力劳动的操作逐步改为机械化，改善企业作业条件，平衡企业的机器设备能力等等，以提高这些企业的生产能力。这是机器制造工业在国家工业化时期的另一个重大任务。这同样是一件十分复杂的工作，需要把许多企业组织起来进行协作，才能完成。
    第二，组织生产协作，能够补救机械工业内部能力不平衡的缺点，克服薄弱环节，使企业剩余的生产能力得到合理的使用和发挥，提高企业的设备利用率和劳动生产率。
    我国机械工业现在正处在由过去以修配为主转向以制造为主的改造阶段，在国家计划工作和企业生产管理工作等方面都还不完善，因此企业中生产任务和生产品种还经常变更，生产中不可免的不断出现着时忙时闲的不平衡现象，使企业生产能力不能充分利用。而组织生产协作，就可能大为改善这种状况。例如，上海柴油机器厂去年十月到十二月，每月都约有一万多小时的计划工作量没有设备来做，生产任务的完成受到了威胁，而上海的新中动力机器厂等厂这时候却有车床闲置着。以后几个企业共同协作，使柴油机器厂顺利完成了生产计划，并增产了六十套油泵支援了求新造船厂，而新中动力厂等厂的闲置设备也得到了充分利用。
    第三，实行生产协作，能够很快地把各企业的力量集结起来，使工业生产中遇到的许多关键性的重大难题，或者临时性的紧急生产任务，能够顺利地迅速地获得解决。例如，东北矿山机械中缺乏配件和牙轮，严重威胁了矿山的生产，长期没有得到解决，去年东北各厂采取了生产协作的办法，根据各厂各种设备潜力的大小进行具体分工，甲厂造模型，乙厂铸造，丙厂加工，使矿山急需的配件和牙轮得到顺利解决。像这样的问题，在我们的工业生产活动中是会经常出现的，而且其影响往往很大。例如沈阳的高压开关厂因生产上存在问题，一连十五个月完不成生产计划，影响全国四十多个建设单位不能按期开工。而这样的问题只有通过协作的形式，把许多企业的力量集结起来，才能解决。沈阳高压开关厂的问题，以后由辽阳地方国营工厂和旅大的其他工厂迅速集结力量进行协作，才得到了解决，并使高压开关厂提前五天完成了国家计划。
    第四，有些地区在组织生产协作中，在国营企业领导下，吸收了公私合营和私营机械工业共同参加，这样就使公私合营和私营机械工厂的生产更有效地纳入了国家计划的轨道，加速了对私营企业的社会主义改造。
    除此之外，生产协作也还能解决其他许多问题，例如企业之间相互技术力量的支援，技术经验的交流等等。不同的企业都可以有不同的协作内容。随着协作工作的发展，这方面的内容今后无疑的必定会无限地丰富起来。
    三
    生产协作为进一步发掘我国机械工业内部的巨大潜力开辟了一条广阔的道路。它不需要国家增加投资，却能为社会创造巨量的财富。但这是一个很复杂细致的组织工作。它对我们来说还是一个很生疏的课题。
    机械工业组织生产协作主要有两种类型。一种是以地区为主的协作。这种协作常常是根据某个临时性的任务，来组织当地各厂的剩余能力，相互取长补短，进行生产，企业的相互之间在生产上没有固定的长期的联系，协作关系随着产品品种的变换和任务的增减，以及生产中发生的新情况而变更，协作的形式灵活多样，华东等地的生产协作以这类协作占多数，它的优点是：因为都在一个地区，因此解决问题迅速及时，可以不必长途运输。在组织生产协作中，这种地区性的协作是不可忽视的重要形式。过去机械工业中有些部门由于存在本位主义思想，只愿在本业务系统内部进行协作，不愿首先在地区实行平衡，曾给国家造成许多损失。如抚顺某厂建设工程急需螺丝、钢架，当时是根据业务系统布置协作的，结果就分在贵州、兰州、广州去生产，贵州的工厂距铁路二百多里，十一公尺的钢架要用电火切断后才能用汽车运，到目的地后再焊好，这样既浪费运输力，又影响产品质量，而这些螺丝、钢架当时在东北其他企业中是可以协作生产的。又如，去年东北电工十厂需要兰克夏锅炉一台，中央第一机械工业部电工局就在局的系统内组织协作，要电工九厂从头设计制造，费时很久，而当时不属该局的、但长年制造这类锅炉的机械十七厂，却没有接到定货。类似这样的例子还很多，所以今后的生产协作首先应力求地区平衡，要避免任何强调本位利益而造成远程运输或相向运输的浪费做法。
    生产协作中的另一种类型，是以部门为主的协作。随着机械工业生产的发展，厂与厂之间的分工日渐明确，要生产成套性的和复杂的产品，每个工厂都不可能单独完成，而需要从其他工厂取得一部分部件或半成品。如机械与电机的协作配合，机械与动力机的协作配合等等。这类协作关系不像前类那样，而是比较长期的和固定的，只要产品固定了，协作关系也就固定了。这种类型的生产协作一般的是在本部门内进行的，它是机械工业实行生产协作的一个很重要的形式。
    总之，地区协作和部门协作两种形式都是不可忽视的，应当根据国家的计划，及主管系统平衡与地区平衡相结合的原则，来灵活运用这两种形式。在组织部门的协作（即系统的协作）时，应先考虑到地区协作；在组织地区的协作时，也应考虑到部门协作。如组织地区协作时，要先组织地区内同一部门的企业去协作；组织部门协作时，应先组织该部门在同一地区的企业去协作。
    加强组织领导，是目前保证生产协作进一步开展的重要一环。地区的财政经济委员会和有关工业部门应当实行明确的分工和合作。为保证协作的执行，可以组成专门机构，运用合同和协议的形式，并把协作逐步纳入经常化和制度化的轨道。现在生产协作工作在各地开展情况还很不平衡。甚至有些机械工业很集中的城市，地区协作还未有计划地开展，协作计划还未普遍列入部、局生产计划。由于组织工作尚不完美，要求协作的新建企业的设备订货，常常是“提得迟，要得急”，以致制造厂不能充分地进行生产准备工作，影响生产协作的顺利进行。
    组织生产协作现在基本上还处于摸索阶段，它还有待于我们在实践中不断地丰富它，充实它，使能更臻于完善。
    四
    生产协作在思想工作方面提出了严重的任务。许多事实说明：本位主义和孤立观点是生产协作最大的思想敌人。我们有些企业、特别是大企业的同志，他们一心只想把自己领导的工厂变成一座“万能工厂”，“我不求人，人不求我”，宁愿让厂里的设备闲置着，而不愿与人协作。有的企业又以“多一事不如少一事”的态度对待协作，把配合协作视为“麻烦”，以种种借口来拒绝，甚至提出了“不赚钱不干”、“材料不现成不干”、“性质复杂不干”、“数量少不干”等条件。有的工厂多偏重本单位的“利益”，没有认识配合重点工程的重要意义，主动进行配合，有的只愿本厂“发挥潜力”，为完成本厂的“产值计划”而四出揽活，而对就近的重点工程的需要却不愿协作。所有这些思想和行为，都反映了这些企业的同志缺乏整体观念和现代工业的经济知识。他们应当知道，生产在任何时候和任何条件下都是社会的生产。人们在生产活动中都必须要有一定的联系和协作，否则便不可能进行生产。而近代工业更把生产中的联系发展到了更高的阶段，这就必须有更高度的配合和协作，那种
  “万事不求人”，“各人自扫门前雪”的孤立观点，实质上都是个体农民和小手工业者的自然经济的反映，它与社会主义大工业的集体主义思想是不相容的。至于不愿为重点工程的需要而协作的思想，当然是更加错误了。支援国家工业化，首先是支援重点工程（国家工业化的基础），这是机械工业头等重要的任务。我们必须反对这种孤立观点和本位主义，提倡从国家整体利益出发，积极与其他企业配合和协作的思想，来开展生产协作工作。
    协作问题上的上述混乱思想，也反映了企业中党的政治思想工作的弱点，和企业领导人缺乏钻研工业经济知识。因此加强思想工作是迫切的任务。有关经济机关的党委和地区的党委，应当把协作问题提到政治原则高度来认识，并把它列为企业政治思想工作的重要内容，经常不断地对机械工业基层企业管理人员进行教育，使他们明确认识到保证供应重点工程设备与改造现有企业旧设备，是机械工业实现国家工业化的光荣任务，也是机械工业增加品种发挥潜力的具体措施，必须积极为重点工程解决困难问题，克服把重点工程订货视为“麻烦事”和“赔钱活”的不正确思想。企业领导干部更应不倦地系统地钻研工业知识，尤其是钻研苏联社会主义工业建设的经验，排除本位主义、局部观点等各种有害于国家建设事业的错误观念。
