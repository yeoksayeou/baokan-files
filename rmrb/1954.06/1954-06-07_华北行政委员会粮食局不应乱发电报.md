Reader's Letter Summary:

	The North China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau Should Not Send Telegrams Indiscriminately

	Reader Na Wenrui writes: The North China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau sent three telegrams to the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau in late March regarding the allocation of burlap sacks. From this, I believe there are two issues that must be brought to the attention of the North China Grain Bureau and improved. First, the Bureau is located in the suburbs of Beijing, while the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau is located in the city, not far apart. Originally, these issues could be resolved with a phone call or a letter, but they sent lengthy telegrams, which not only wasted telegram fees but also wasted manpower and time due to sending and receiving telegrams. Second, some telegrams overlap with the instructions of the Central Ministry of Grain. For example, on March 19th, the Central Ministry of Grain instructed the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau to complete the April allocation plan for burlap sacks in advance in March to meet the urgent needs of other provinces. After receiving this instruction, comrades in our bureau actively arranged for various grain depots to ship in advance. However, on March 25th, the North China Grain Bureau sent another telegram stating: "The Central Ministry of Grain has notified and issued the inter-regional burlap sack allocation and transportation plan for April 1954. This bureau will not issue a separate notice. Please comply accordingly..." The entire text consists of seventy-nine characters. I feel that there was no need to send such a telegram.

	The North China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau's Response

	The North China Administrative Committee Grain Bureau writes: Comrade Na Wenrui of the Beijing Municipal Grain Bureau is completely correct in his criticism of our bureau's indiscriminate sending of telegrams. To thoroughly correct this shortcoming, our bureau recently held a meeting to conduct research and inspection.
		In March and April, our bureau sent a total of five clear-text telegrams, totaling one thousand three hundred and ninety-seven characters, to seventeen units. Among them, it was found that ten units, totaling one thousand and fifty-eight characters, did not require telegrams at all and could have been resolved with other forms of official documents, resulting in waste. The reasons for this shortcoming are: on the one hand, our bureau was newly established, and comrades were not very familiar with the business, fearing delays in work and failure to complete tasks, thus generating the idea of "rather more documents and telegrams than delaying matters." On the other hand, we were not specific enough in arranging work and lacked serious and timely inspection after the arrangements were made. To correct this shortcoming, we plan to pay attention to the following aspects: 1. We will resolutely not send telegrams that do not need to be sent. If a telegram needs to be sent but can be resolved by other means (including substitute telegrams, official documents, informal letters, telephone calls, etc.), we will also not send telegrams. 2. If a matter is sent to multiple locations simultaneously and truly needs to be sent by telegram, a telegram will be sent, but for nearby areas such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, other forms of official documents will be used instead. 3. If a telegram truly needs to be sent, we will adhere to the spirit of economy, and the language will be as concise and to the point as possible to avoid lengthy telegrams. 4. Regarding the issue of repeated documents and telegrams, our bureau has consulted with the Central Ministry of Grain to study a unified solution.

### 华北行政委员会粮食局不应乱发电报

专栏：读者来信摘要

    华北行政委员会粮食局不应乱发电报
    读者那文瑞来信：华北行政委员会粮食局为了调拨麻袋事，曾在三月下旬向北京市粮食局发来三份电报，从这里我觉得有两个问题必须引起华北粮食局注意和改进。第一、该局在北京市郊，而北京市粮食局就住在城里，相隔不远，本来像这些问题只要通一下电话，或者写一封信即可解决，但他们却发来长篇大论的电报，这不仅浪费了电报费，而且由于收发电报还浪费了人力和时间。第二、个别电报还与中央粮食部的指示发生重复现象。如三月十九日，中央粮食部指示北京市粮食局必须将四月份调拨麻袋计划提前在三月份完成，以利他省急需。我局经办同志接到这一指示后已积极布置各粮库提前发运。但到三月二十五日，华北粮食局又发来一份电报，电文说：“一九五四年四月份大区间麻袋调拨运输计划，中央粮食部已通知下达，本局不另通知，希遵照执行……。”全文共计七十九个字。我觉得像这样的电报实在没有发的必要。
    华北行政委员会粮食局的答复
    华北行政委员会粮食局来信：北京市粮食局那文瑞同志对我局乱发电报的批评完全正确。为彻底纠正这种缺点，我局在最近召开了会议，进行了研究和检查。
      三、四月份我局共发明码电报五份，计一千三百九十七字，发往十七个单位，其中检查出根本不需用电报而可以用其它公文形式解决的，有十个单位，计一千零五十八字，因而造成了浪费。产生这
  一缺点的原因：一方面因我局成立不久，同志们对业务不太熟悉，惟恐耽误工作，完不成任务，遂产生了“宁多些文电，不要误了事”的思想。另一方面，我们在布置工作时不够具体，既布置之后又缺乏认真和及时的检查。为纠正这一缺点，我们计划从下列几方面加以注意。一、可以不用电报发出者就坚决不发，应该用电报发出而又可以改用其他形式解决者（包括代电、公文、便函、电话等），也不拍发电报。二、一事兼发多处，同时也确实须以电报发出者，则拍发电报，但对北京、天津、河北等附近地区当改以其他公文形式。三、确实需要拍发电报者，则本节约精神，文字力求简明扼要，避免电文冗长现象。四、关于文电重复问题，我局已商请中央粮食部统一研究解决。
