    Newly Built Lake Celebration Vessel Has Shallow Draft and High Speed; Trial Voyage on Xiang River Shows Good Results
    A shallow-draft, high-speed steam-powered iron-hulled shallow water tugboat has been successfully trial-produced. The trial voyage ceremony was held on the Xiang River on June 3, and the trial voyage went well.
    This tugboat, named the Lake Celebration (湖庆轮), was designed last October by Long Zhaoxia, a technician from the Hunan Provincial Inland Navigation Administration Bureau, and manufactured by the jointly owned public-private Minsheng Shipping Company's Chongqing Shipyard. In the process of design and manufacture, it received assistance from the Central Ministry of Communications River Transport Administration Bureau and the Central South Administrative Committee Transportation Bureau. The biggest features of this tugboat are its shallow draft and high speed. Generally, tugboats have a draft of about five or six feet when sailing, while the Lake Celebration’s average draft is about three feet and three inches. Therefore, it can still travel on various shipping channels within the province even during the dry season. During the trial voyage of the Lake Celebration on the Xiang River, its single-sailing speed was 16.5 kilometers per hour, which is about 17 percent faster than the speed of ordinary tugboats.

    新制湖庆轮吃水浅航速快
    在湘江试航情况良好
    一艘吃水浅、航速快的蒸汽铁壳浅水拖轮试制成功，六月三日在湘江举行试航典礼，试航情况良好。
    这艘拖轮命名为湖庆轮，是去年十月，由湖南省内河航运管理局技术员龙肇夏设计，由公私合营民生轮船公司重庆船舶修造厂承制的。在设计、制造过程中，曾得到中央交通部河运管理总局、中南行政委员会交通局多方协助。这条拖轮最大的特点是吃水浅、航速快。一般拖轮航行时吃水约五、六市尺，湖庆轮平均吃水约三尺三寸左右。因此，即在枯水季节，仍可在省内各轮船航道上行驶。湖庆轮在湘江试航时，单驶航速为每小时十六公里半，比一般拖轮的航速快百分之十七左右。
