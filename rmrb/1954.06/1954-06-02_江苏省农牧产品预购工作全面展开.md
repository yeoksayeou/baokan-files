Jiangsu Province Fully Launches Pre-Purchase of Agricultural and Animal Products

The pre-purchase work of agricultural and animal products in Jiangsu Province has been fully launched. According to statistics from twenty-nine counties, supply and marketing cooperatives have signed more than 14,000 pre-purchase contracts for wheat and rapeseed with farmers, and the state has paid farmers over 3.8 billion yuan in pre-purchase deposits.

Various regions in Jiangsu have vigorously carried out the pre-purchase work of agricultural and animal products, supporting spring plowing and production, and boosting farmers' enthusiasm for production. After the farmers of Xisu Township in Kunshan County pre-sold a large amount of rapeseed to the state, they immediately planted more than 60,000 sunflower plants in order to sell more oil to the state. After the Xinxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pi County signed a pre-sale contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, it formulated an agricultural production increase plan, deciding to plant 4,000 sunflower plants, increase the production of 17,000 jin of soybeans through wasteland reclamation and intercropping, and use wild grass to feed pigs to save grain and sell more to the state.

    江苏省农牧产品预购工作全面展开
    江苏省预购农业和牧业产品的工作已经全面展开。据二十九个县的统计，供销合作社已和农民签订小麦、菜籽预购合同一万四千多件，国家已付给农民三十八亿余元预购定金。
    江苏各地大力开展农业和牧业产品预购工作，支持了春耕生产，鼓舞了农民的生产热情。昆山县西宿乡农民把大批菜籽预售给国家以后，立即种植了六万余棵向日葵，以便将更多的油料卖给国家；邳县新星农业生产合作社和供销合作社订预售合同以后，订出了农业增产计划，决定种四千棵向日葵，用开荒、间种等办法增产一万七千斤大豆，并用野草等喂猪，以节省粮食，多卖给国家。（陈开甲）
