Strengthening the Transformation of Draft Animal Traffickers and Traders
Zhou Jun

With the increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production, the demand for draft animals is becoming more urgent, while the breeding of livestock cannot keep up with the needs. Under this circumstance, doing a good job in the allocation of livestock plays a significant role in increasing agricultural production.

At present, farmers in various regions have a very urgent need for draft animals. Farmers who have not raised livestock for generations are now asking to buy them, and farmers who have already organized are generally asking to change small livestock for large livestock. At present, the main source of livestock relies on livestock markets, mule and horse fairs, and exchange meetings. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, more than 21,000 head of livestock were traded at primary market exchange meetings. In Keshan County, more than 2,000 head of livestock were put on the market in five districts over twelve days, with 555 head traded. In Hebei Province's Xushui County, 7,213 head of livestock were traded in seventeen livestock markets in the first quarter of this year. In Shandong Province's Pingyuan County, more than 200 head of livestock were put on the market in the town of Chengguan at each fair, with a transaction volume of 30 percent. Among the livestock traded, some were exchanged between farmers through traders (brokers), and some were purchased from livestock traffickers through traders. The proportion accounted for by the supply and marketing cooperative system is very small. Last year, the proportion of livestock operated by cooperatives in thirteen provinces and cities, including Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Gansu, averaged only 0.27 per thousand of the market adjustment volume, while in the suburbs of Beijing and other places, it accounted for 1.5 percent. This proves that the livestock needed by farmers today is mostly supplied by livestock traffickers and traders.

Currently, there are approximately 200,000 livestock traders across the country. In the old society, livestock brokers and livestock traffickers were extremely dishonest in their operations. They often made secret gestures and whispered prices, secretly deceiving farmers. They did not publicly bargain during transactions, but shook hands or used jargon instead of numbers, using secret language to deceive farmers. They sold sick and old livestock as good livestock to farmers. In addition, there were various ways to exploit farmers. Farmers suffered from this feudal exploitation for a long time. After liberation, these personnel have not been well reformed.

At present, due to the fact that the livestock on the market cannot meet the needs of farmers, coupled with speculation by livestock traffickers, the price of livestock in some areas has risen unreasonably, and the livestock market in some areas has fallen into disorder. In March of this year, the price of livestock in the Luohe market in Henan Province increased by 40 percent compared with December of last year, with a large cow rising from 1.8 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan. Farmers in Harbin City spent more than 10 million yuan extra in buying 25 horses. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will be extremely detrimental to agricultural production. Therefore, strengthening the education and transformation of livestock traffickers and traders so that they can serve agricultural production is a task that must be done well by local industrial and commercial administrative departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and tax departments.

First, we should strengthen the education of livestock traffickers and traders. Livestock traffickers and traders have more abundant technical experience because they have been engaged in livestock trafficking and trading for a long time, with some having four or five decades of history and others having eight or nine years. Although they have been deeply poisoned by the old society and their ideological transformation is slow, they have rich experience in the selection, purchase, trafficking, conservation, training, disease treatment, and appraisal of livestock. If they are patiently educated and transformed, and their experience and technology are used for adjustment and exchange, it will greatly help in supplying the livestock needed by farmers. In order to transform livestock traders, in addition to carrying out patient education, we must also strengthen management work, such as establishing meeting systems, market management methods, and supervision and inspection systems (those with better thinking and rich experience can be drawn from traders to specialize in transaction review work), and formulate traders' codes of conduct, reward and punishment methods, etc., so that the combination of education and management can achieve greater results. Any laissez-faire approach is incorrect.

Second, traders should be identified, registered, and employed according to their abilities. Because the exploitation of livestock transactions was serious in the old society, farmers themselves mostly engaged in livestock trading, thus forming the current surplus of traders. Therefore, local grassroots commercial administration, supply and marketing cooperatives, and tax departments should carefully register and identify traders, determine the number of traders to be retained according to the size of the livestock market and the workload of traders, and then retain them separately based on technical experience and the attitude of serving farmers. Those who remain should be persuaded to specialize in agriculture or turn to handicrafts, which is beneficial to the development of production and is also possible. For example, among the nineteen traders in the town of Chengguan in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, all have land, and three of them can also weave leggings. Among the six traders in Shizilu, only one has no land.

Third, under the current circumstances where the proportion of livestock operations by supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels is extremely small (the statistics of thirteen provinces and cities last year were 0.27 per thousand, and although this year there has been an increase, it will not be too much), adjusting livestock through the original livestock traffickers can both solve the needs of farmers and invigorate the rural market. Therefore, local supply and marketing cooperatives should take measures such as entrusting purchases, consigning transportation, or other methods according to the conditions, or absorbing them to participate in the work, so that they can serve agricultural production. However, in order to prevent livestock traffickers from taking the opportunity to deceive farmers, we should promote measures such as "guaranteeing the trough, guaranteeing survival, and guaranteeing the mouth," and prohibit their illegal activities in transactions. For example, Xushui County in Hebei Province has promoted this method, which is very popular among the masses of farmers. Some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have adopted the method of "clearly marked prices" when selling livestock, which the masses are also very satisfied with. The above methods can be tried out in key livestock markets in various regions and gradually promoted.

    加强对耕畜贩运商和交易员的改造
    周　钧
    农民生产积极性提高后，对耕畜的要求更加迫切，而牲畜的繁殖赶不上需要，在这种情况下，作好牲畜的调剂工作，对增加农业生产有很大的作用。
    目前各地农民对耕畜的要求是很迫切的。几代没有养过牲畜的农民，今天也要求买牲畜，已经组织起来的农民则普遍要求变小牲口为大牲口。而目前牲畜的来源主要依靠牲口集市骡马大会及交流会供应。如黑龙江全省在初级市场的交流会上，成交牲口二万一千余头，其中克山县五个区十二天上市牲口二千余头，成交五百五十五头；河北省徐水县十七个牲口集市，今年第一季度成交牲口七千二百十三头；山东省平原县城关镇每集上市牲口二百余头，成交量占百分之三十。在成交的牲口中，一部分由农民通过交易员（牙纪）互相交换，一部分通过交易员购自牲口贩运商。供销合作社系统所占比重很小。去年山东、山西、河南、甘肃等十三省市合作社经营牲口的比重，平均只占市场调剂数千分之二点七，北京郊区等地占百分之一点五。由此证明：今天农民所需的牲口，极大部分是通过牲畜贩子、交易员供应的。
    目前全国从事牲口交易的牙纪，约有二十万人左右。在旧社会里，牲口牙纪与牲口贩子的经营极不老实，他们经常拉手暗语、双方瞒价。成交时不公开讲价，袖统拉手或用行话代替数字、说暗语瞒哄农民。把病、老牲口当好牲口卖给农民。此外还有各种剥削农民的办法。农民长时期受着这种封建剥削。解放后，这些人员还未得到很好改造。
      目前由于上市牲口不能满足农民的需要，再加上牲口贩运商从中投机，形成有些地区的牲畜价格不合理的上涨，有些地区的牲畜市场陷于紊乱。河南省漯河市场今年三月牲畜价比去年十二月上涨百分之四十，一头大牛由一八○万元涨至二五○万元。哈尔滨市农民在买二十五匹马中即多花一千余万元。如果听任这种情况继续发生，对农业生产是极为不利的。因此，加强对牲畜贩子交易员的教育和改造，使其为农业生产服务，是各地工商行政部门、供销合作社以及税务部门，必须作好的一项工作。
    首先应加强对牲口贩子交易员的教育工作。牲口贩子交易员因长期从事牲口贩运与交易，技术经验均较丰富，多者有四、五十年，少者也有八、九年的历史，虽然他们受旧社会的遗毒较深，思想作风的改造较慢，但对牲口的选购、贩运、保育训养、疾病治疗，以及对牲口的鉴别评议等，是有丰富经验的。如果经过耐心教育，加以改造，利用其经验技术，进行调剂交换，对供应农民所需的牲口帮助很大。为了改造牲口交易员，除进行耐心教育外，还必须加强管理工作，例如建立会议制度，市场管理办法，监督检查制度（可从交易员中抽调思想较好、经验丰富者专作成交复查工作）订出交易员守则、奖惩办法等，使教育与管理相结合，可收到更大的效果，任何放任不管的作法，是不对的。
    其次，对交易员应进行鉴别登记，量才录用。由于在旧社会成交牲口剥削严重，故农民自己多从事牲口交易，因而形成今天交易员的过剩。因此各地基层商业行政、供销合作社、税务部门，应认真地把交易员进行登记，加以鉴别，按牲口市场的大小，交易员的工作量，确定应留交易员数目，再根据技术经验及为农民服务态度，分别留用，余者劝其专事农业或转向手工业，这对发展生产是有利的，并且，这也是可能的。例如山东省平原县城关集的十九个交易员中，全部有土地，其中有三户还会织腿带，十字路六个交易员，只有一人无土地。
    第三、在目前各级供销合作社对牲畜经营比重极其微小的情况下（去年十三个省市的统计为千分之二·七，今年虽有提高，但也不会太多）通过原有牲口贩运商，调剂牲畜，既能解决农民的需要，亦可活跃农村市场，因此，各地供销合作社应根据条件，采取委托代购、代运或其他方式，或吸收其参加工作。使其为农业生产服务。但为了杜绝牲口贩运商乘机欺骗农民，应推行“保槽、保活、保口”等办法，禁止其在交易中的不法行为。如河北省徐水县推行这一办法，颇受农民群众欢迎。有的基层供销合作社卖牲口，曾采用“明码标价”办法，群众也很满意。以上办法，各地牲口市场可重点试办，逐步推广。
