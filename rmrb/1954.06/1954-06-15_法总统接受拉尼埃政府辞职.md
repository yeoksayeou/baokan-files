Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 14th: After consulting with the leaders of various French political parties, French President Coty accepted the resignation of the Laniel government on the 13th.

After the Laniel government failed in the National Assembly vote on the 12th, and because the number of votes against the Laniel government fell eight votes short of an absolute majority (314 votes), Bidault and others made every effort to persuade Laniel to continue in office. However, the Radical Socialist Party, which participated in the current government, indicated to Coty on the 12th that it did not intend to remain in the current government, causing the attempt to have Laniel continue in office to fail.

    法总统接受拉尼埃政府辞职
    【新华社十四日讯】巴黎消息：法国总统戈蒂在和法国各政党领袖会商后，已在十三日接受拉尼埃政府辞职。
    拉尼埃政府在十二日国民议会的投票中失败后，由于反对拉尼埃政府的票数差八票没有达到绝对多数（三百一十四票），皮杜尔等人曾竭力要求拉尼埃继续执政。但是，参加现政府的激进社会党却在十二日向戈蒂表示激进社会党不打算再留在现政府中，使得要拉尼埃继续执政的企图遭到失败。
