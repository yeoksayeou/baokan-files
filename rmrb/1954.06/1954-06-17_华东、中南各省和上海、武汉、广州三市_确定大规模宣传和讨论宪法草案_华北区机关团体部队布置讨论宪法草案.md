East China and Central South Provinces, and Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou Determine Large-Scale Propaganda and Discussion of Draft Constitution
North China Region Organs, Organizations, and Troops Deploy Discussion of Draft Constitution
The provinces of East China and many special districts, cities, and counties have successively established draft constitution discussion committees. The draft constitution discussion committees of Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces have separately formulated plans for conducting propaganda and discussion of the draft constitution among the people. Most provinces have begun to concentrate on training reporters and propagandists for cities and villages. Anhui Province's institutions of higher learning, the Huai River Management Committee, Bengbu Railway Transportation Sub-bureau, and other units have successively established draft constitution discussion committees. Reporters and propagandists from all over the province are about to set out to give reports and propaganda to people from all walks of life. Special districts, cities, and most counties in Fujian Province have also successively established draft constitution discussion committees. Constitution draft discussion committees at all levels and local leading organs have selected and trained a group of reporters and propagandists. The provincial draft constitution discussion committee is also preparing to assist the upcoming people's congresses of various cities and counties in organizing people's representatives to study and discuss. The draft constitution discussion committees of special districts, cities, and counties in Jiangsu Province were successively established in early June. Before the promulgation of the draft constitution, leading cadres and people from all walks of life in local organs, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, and universities and middle schools had already begun reading and discussing the initial draft of the constitution. From the 3rd to the 14th of this month, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China concentrated 237 leading cadres from special districts, cities, and counties to study and discuss the initial draft of the constitution. Nanjing City has concentrated on training reporters, and counties throughout the province plan to train reporters and section-level cadres in batches. In addition, cadres of Zhejiang Province's first-level organs also began discussing the draft constitution on the 16th.

The Shanghai Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee was established on the 15th. At the inaugural meeting, the work of publicizing and discussing the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China throughout the city was also discussed. The Shanghai Municipal Draft Constitution Discussion Committee includes 39 responsible persons from various aspects such as the Municipal People's Government, the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, local organizations of democratic parties in Shanghai, and people's organizations. Chen Yi, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, is the director, Pan Hannian, Sheng Pihua, Liu Jiping, and Shen Zhiyuan are the deputy directors, and an office is established to preside over daily work. Branches or sub-branches of the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee will also be established in the near future by units such as districts in the city and suburbs of Shanghai, local organizations of democratic parties in Shanghai, people's organizations, government departments, and the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At present, propaganda and discussion will first be carried out among cadres and a large number of reporters and propagandists. Then propaganda will be carried out among the people of the city and discussions will be organized.

The draft constitution discussion committees of Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces in the Central South Region, as well as Wuhan and Guangzhou, have been successively established. The Guangxi Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee also decided to be established on June 15. The draft constitution discussion committees of all provinces and cities have determined to organize the study of the draft constitution among the vast number of cadres, and will vigorously launch propaganda and discussion among the broad masses of the people. The specific plan for the study of the draft constitution by cadres in Wuhan has been determined. More than 800 reporters in the city have heard the mobilization report on studying the draft constitution. After a short period of training, they are prepared to conduct large-scale propaganda activities among the people from the 21st. More than 2,000 reporters and propagandists in Guangzhou have also been concentrated for training. More than 700 reporters from various special districts, cities, and counties in Henan Province, as well as the railway system and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission system, were concentrated in Kaifeng on the 7th for training, which ended on the 15th. The provinces and cities also stipulated that when convening the people's congresses of counties and cities, the report and discussion of the draft constitution should be listed as an important agenda item to mobilize representatives to fully discuss it. The draft constitution discussion committees of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi Province and Nanning and Wuzhou have also been established successively. According to the situation in the remote mountainous areas of Guixi, where there are many mountains, a wide area, and a sparse population, the Draft Constitution Discussion Committee of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region determined that, in addition to the counties combining with the county people's congresses to discuss it, cadres of the directly subordinate organs of the autonomous region will first study it, and then organize forces to go deep into the counties to assist county-level organs, schools, factories, mines, and troops in studying and discussing it.

Organs and organizations at the first level in the North China region and the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have deployed the work of discussing the "Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China" to all cadres. The party organizations of the organs directly under the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the North China Administrative Committee have made plans to discuss the draft constitution, and have distributed them to their respective subordinate branches. On June 10 and 12, Ping Jiesan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, reported the basic contents of the initial draft of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China to some cadres and reporters from various organs, organizations, and troops. He particularly emphasized the importance of strengthening the concept of abiding by the law through the discussion of the draft constitution for staff members of organs and revolutionary soldiers. After listening to the report, some reporters from the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army went to the companies to convey it. Units such as the North China Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Health Bureau and Construction Engineering Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee have now formally begun to discuss the draft constitution.
