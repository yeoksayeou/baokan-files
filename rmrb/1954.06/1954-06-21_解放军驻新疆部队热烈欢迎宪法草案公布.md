Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 20th: Cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang warmly hailed the publication of the draft constitution and expressed their support for the draft constitution with practical actions.

    Zhong Fei, deputy company commander of the Ninth Company of a certain unit, risked his life during the Liberation War to blow up the Fengxiang city gate in Shaanxi, which was guarded by bandit troops, wiped out the defending enemy, and captured more than seventy enemies with his comrade Yu Qiyuan, earning a first-class merit. After reading the draft constitution, he said with emotion: "In the past, our purpose in going through life and death and shedding blood was to strive for the independence of the motherland and the democratic rights of the people. Today, the draft constitution has been published, and our ideals of many years have been realized. We must work hard to learn military science, lead soldiers to practice their skills, defend the independence of the motherland, and consolidate the people's democratic system."

    Cadres and soldiers of a certain guard unit of the Xinjiang Military Region held a discussion after the publication of the draft constitution. Chen Qingyu, a model Communist Party member who had been awarded three major merits and four minor merits in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, said: "The draft constitution specifically stipulates the national system of the People's Congress system. People's representatives are elected by voters and are supervised by voters. It shows the superiority of our country's political system. Every one of our citizens, especially revolutionary soldiers, must be loyal to the people's democratic system, abide by the constitution and laws, and be a model executor of the constitution and laws."

    Wu Sidong, a military instructor of a tank company of a certain unit, said: "Our country is a multi-ethnic country. The draft constitution specifically stipulates that all ethnic groups enjoy the same equal rights and obligations. Therefore, we, who live on the frontier of the motherland, should better respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, implement the Party's ethnic policies, and serve the interests of all ethnic groups wholeheartedly."

    Gao Zi'e, a special-class meritorious hero of a certain artillery company, said: "After liberation, we working people have become masters of our own affairs. The soldiers of our people's army must take the lead in publicizing and discussing the draft constitution, and pass on the opinions put forward by everyone in future study and discussion to the provincial draft constitution discussion committee."

    新疆军区某警卫部队的干部、战士，在宪法草案公布后举行了座谈。曾经在抗日战争和解放战争中荣立三次大功和四次小功的模范共产党员陈庆玉说：“宪法草案具体规定了人民代表大会制的国家制度，人民代表由选民产生，并受选民监督，它显示了我们国家政治制度的优越。我们每一个公民，特别是革命战士，必须效忠人民民主制度，服从宪法和法律，作一个宪法和法律的模范执行者。”
    某部战车连军事教员武肆栋说：“我们国家是一个多民族的国家，在宪法草案中特别提出了各民族享有同样的平等权利和义务，因此，我们生活在祖国边疆，就更应该很好地尊重少数民族风俗习惯，执行党的民族政策，全心全意为各族人民的利益服务。”
    某炮兵连特等功臣高子鹅说：“解放后我们劳动人民当家作主了，我们人民军队的战士一定要带头宣传和讨论宪法草案，并把大家在今后学习讨论中所提出的意见转给省的宪法草案讨论委员会。”
