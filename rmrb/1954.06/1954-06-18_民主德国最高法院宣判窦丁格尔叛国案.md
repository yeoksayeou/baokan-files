Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 16th: According to a report from the German News Agency, the trial of the treason case of Georg Dödinger, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, by the Supreme Court of the German Democratic Republic has concluded. The trial proved that the Dödinger treasonous group helped the enemies of the German Democratic Republic to undermine the republic's democratic order, thus committing a serious crime of betraying national interests.

The Supreme Court ruled that the crimes of the Dödinger treasonous group were: attempting to subvert the German Democratic Republic; destroying the achievements gained by the democratic regime; and attempting to restore the power of monopoly capital, large landlords, and fascists. The Supreme Court sentenced the principal offender Dödinger to fifteen years in prison, and the other five criminals to terms ranging from thirteen to three years.

As early as 1946, the Dödinger treasonous group established contact with the spy organizations of American and British imperialism, providing them with intelligence on the strength, outposts, strongholds of the People's Police, the locations and equipment of the Soviet occupation forces, and the production of major factories.

The defendant Dödinger held talks in West Berlin with Otto Lenz, State Secretary of the Bonn government, Adenauer's confidant, and an American agent, to formulate detailed plans to subvert the government of the German Democratic Republic. The defendant Dödinger had close ties with Officer Dilger of the American spy organization, Asendorf, an agent of the American spy organization, and Kronika, an agent of the British spy organization. Dödinger accepted the task from American and British spy organizations to organize armed fascist bandits to cross the border into the German Democratic Republic.

The defendant Dödinger and his accomplices have fully admitted to the above-mentioned serious crimes.
