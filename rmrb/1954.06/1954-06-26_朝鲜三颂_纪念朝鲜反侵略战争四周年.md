Three Odes to Korea
——Commemorating the Fourth Anniversary of the Korean War Against Aggression Wei Yang
	A sharp knife, flashing in the smoke of war.
	Cutting off the bloody hands of the aggressors, making MacArthur and Van Fleet break their legs and lose their arms;
	Piercing the illusions of Wall Street, turning their war timetable into a blank sheet of paper;
	Making them haul back, not the gold and silver treasures of the East, but a thick book of casualty statistics!
	Ah, Korea! You are a sharp knife, forever held high on those peaks where heroic names endure, forever flashing coldly before the ambitious.

	A wall of iron and bronze, not bricks or tiles, but thirty million hearts, standing firm on the 38th parallel!
	You defended yourselves, and also defended your Chinese brothers;
	You defended Moranbong, and also defended the land and sky of Asia.
	Ah, Korea! You are a wall of iron and bronze, you defend the happiness that the people have already obtained, and also defend the beautiful dreams of the future of mankind!
	A graceful azalea, you bloom in the East of Asia.
	The corpses of robbers have become your fertile soil;
	The blood of heroes is the rain and dew that irrigates you.
	Your fragrance permeates the hearts of peace-loving people.
	Every kind person in the world looks up to your handsome face.
	Ah, Korea! You are a graceful azalea, blooming so beautifully!
	You bloom in the awakened East, you bloom in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people!

     朝鲜三颂
     ——纪念朝鲜反侵略战争四周年　未　央一把锋利的刀，在烟火里闪光。斩断侵略者的血手，叫麦克阿瑟、范佛里特断腿缺膀；戳破华尔街的迷梦，叫他们的战争时间表变成白纸一张；叫他们捞回去的，不是东方的金银财宝，却是厚厚的一本伤亡统计账！啊，朝鲜！你是一把锋利的刀，永远高举在那些英名长存的山峰上，永远在野心家的面前闪着寒光。
  一道铁壁铜墙，不是砖也不是瓦，是三千万颗心，屹立在三八线上！你保卫了自己，也保卫了中国兄弟；你保卫了牡丹峰，也保卫了亚洲的陆地天空。啊，朝鲜！你是一道铁壁铜墙，你保卫了人民已经得到的幸福，也保卫了人类的未来的美梦！一朵挺秀的金达莱啊，你开在亚洲的东方。强盗的尸骨做了你的沃土；英雄的鲜血是灌溉你的雨露。你的香透入和平人民的心胸。世界上每一个善良的人都抬头仰望着你英俊的面容。啊，朝鲜！你是一朵挺秀的金达莱，开得多好啊！你开在觉醒了的东方，你开在亿万人的心上！
