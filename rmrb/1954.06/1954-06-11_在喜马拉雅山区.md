　　At the end of March, I followed the agricultural loan work team of a certain unit of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from Xigaze to the Himalayan Mountains. We arrived in the Guma area near the foot of the Himalayas, where the altitude was already over 4,000 meters above sea level. There are large grasslands here, grazing herds of cattle and sheep. In the distance, the towering snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas soar into the clouds, standing like giants on the border of the motherland.

　　In April, the land in the Himalayan Mountains had just begun to thaw, and the Tibetan people were busy lambing, repairing irrigation canals, and drying dung. There are crisscrossing irrigation canals in the mountains. These canals pass through the rock walls and divert melted snow water from the mountains to irrigate the fields. Lush pastures grow by the Zhuomudeng Glacier Lake at the foot of the mountain, with countless cattle and sheep. The big fat sheep produced in Kangba Zong weigh up to 130 jin each. The wool fibers are fine and long and can be spun into even fine wool yarn. The herdsmen dye the wool in various colors with pigment-containing grass, and the pulu and Tibetan felt woven from it are of good quality and beautiful. There are also large forests in the mountains, producing many kinds of medicinal materials.

　　Last year, the Tibetan farmers in the mountainous areas received interest-free grain and loans from the Central People's Government, overcame difficulties in production, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with yields more than double those of the previous year. In the Taikong area of Kangba Zong, there are two glacier lakes. Six years ago, floods caused by rising snow water caused continuous water disasters in the nearby areas. Last year, the farmers built a large canal and built a dam to block the snow water flowing down from the mountain, which not only prevented water disasters, but also irrigated many fields. The farmers heard that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa had successfully tried planting various vegetables, and they also tried planting lettuce and greens. The 23 farmers of Jinlong Xidui who had fled famine before liberation have now returned to their hometowns. After receiving interest-free loans from the People's Government, they applied fertilizer to the fields and are determined to grow good crops on the barren land. In Kongma Village, Kangba Zong, a newly established small school has appeared. When we visited, the children were sitting in the sun practicing Tibetan with bamboo pens on small blackboards. Teacher Nima Wangdui introduced the school's situation to us. He said excitedly: "When I see these children put down their shepherd's whips and pick up bamboo pens to study, I think of Chairman Mao. This is the happiness that our ancestors never had!"

    在喜马拉雅山区
    新华社记者　赵家烈
    三月底，记者随中国人民解放军西藏军区部队某部农贷工作组，从日喀则向喜马拉雅山区进发。我们到达靠近喜马拉雅山脚的古马地区，地势已是拔海四千公尺以上。这里有大片草原，牧放着成群的牛羊。远处，巍峨的喜马拉雅山的群峰雪顶，直插云霄，像巨人一样矗立在祖国的边疆。
    四月，喜马拉雅山区的土地刚刚开始解冻，藏民们正忙着接羔、修水渠和晒粪。山区里有纵横相接的水渠，这些水渠通过岩壁，把山上融化了的雪水引下来灌溉田地。山下卓木登冰川湖畔长着茂盛的牧草，有无数的牛羊。康巴宗出产的大肥羊，最大的有一百三十斤重，羊毛纤维细长，可纺成均匀的细毛线。牧民们用含有色素的草把羊毛染成各种颜色，织出来的氆氇和藏毡，质地良好而且美观。山区里还有着大片森林，出产很多种药材。
    去年，山区藏族农民，得到了中央人民政府的无息贷粮和贷款，克服了生产中的困难，得到从未有过的丰收，产量超过前年一倍。在康巴宗的台孔地方，有两个冰川湖，六年前因雪水暴涨，曾使附近地区连年遭受水患。去年农民们修了一条大水渠，筑坝拦住从山上流下来的雪水，不但防止了水患，而且还灌溉了很多田地。农民们听说驻拉萨的人民解放军试种各种蔬菜成功，也试种了莴苣和青菜。金龙溪堆解放前逃荒在外的二十三户农民，现在也都回到了家乡，他们得到人民政府的无息贷款后，在地里加施了肥料，决心在荒芜的土地上种出好庄稼来。在康巴宗的孔马村，出现了一座刚办起来的小学校。当我们去访问时，孩子们正坐在阳光下用竹笔在小黑板上练习藏文。教员尼玛旺堆向我们介绍了学校的情况，他激动地说：“当我一看到这些放下牧羊鞭子拿起竹笔学习的孩子，就要想到毛主席。这是我们祖辈从没得到的幸福！”
