After the establishment of the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee on the 1st, twenty-three sub-committees were successively established in the city, and the training of speakers began on June 4th. Currently, city speakers have listened to three reports by Zhang Youyu, Chairman of the Beijing Draft Constitution Discussion Committee, on the basic spirit and main content of the draft constitution, as well as the interpretation of the articles of the draft constitution. After the establishment of the Tianjin Draft Constitution Discussion Committee on June 8th, it has begun preparations for training city speakers and propagandists. The Shanxi Provincial Draft Constitution Discussion Committee was officially established on the 8th and held its first plenary meeting. The meeting studied the plan for publicizing and discussing the draft constitution among the people of the province. Subsequently, the draft constitution discussion committees of Taiyuan, Yangquan, and Changzhi cities, as well as Changzhi, Xinxian, and Yanbei special districts, were also established successively and formulated specific plans for publicizing and discussing the draft constitution. The draft constitution discussion committees of Yuci Special District and counties throughout the province are also being prepared for establishment. Local plans stipulate that the discussion of the draft constitution will be the main agenda item at the people's congresses to be convened in counties and cities throughout the province, and reports will be made to the voters after the meetings. The work of training speakers and propagandists by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanxi provincial committees at all levels is also underway or about to begin. The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee recently issued a notice to CPC committees at all levels throughout the province regarding the discussion of the draft constitution. The CPC Taiyuan Municipal Committee began training 250 speakers and propaganda cadres on the 5th, which is expected to end on the 15th; the training of 1,000 propagandists also began on the 13th. The Taiyuan Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau is organizing forces to prepare to cooperate with the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution. The remaining special districts and CPC county committees have also begun preparations for training speakers and propagandists. The draft constitution discussion committees of special districts, cities, and counties in Hebei Province have been established and have begun working. Currently, Hebei Province is carrying out the training of speakers and propagandists to publicize the draft constitution to the broad masses of the people after it is promulgated.

After the establishment of the draft constitution discussion committees in the provinces and cities of Northeast China, the first plenary meetings were held to formulate plans for the publicity and discussion of the draft constitution, and the various tasks that should be carried out at present were determined. At present, the provinces and cities have started or are about to start training speakers and propagandists, so that after the draft constitution is promulgated, in-depth publicity and discussion can be carried out among the people of all walks of life. Since June 7th, Heilongjiang Province has trained 108 propaganda ministers of the CPC county (city) committees and civil affairs section chiefs of the county (city) people's governments. Shenyang City has organized 2,000 speakers to listen to reports on constitutional issues and answered questions raised in the study. The Benxi City Draft Constitution Propaganda Backbone Training Class started training on June 9th, with more than 300 people participating in the study, including speakers, propaganda cadres, and worker political instructors. Benxi City plans to train for two consecutive periods of five days each. From June 3rd to 7th, Jilin Province has trained 807 speakers. Harbin City will concentrate 600 speakers and conduct training through methods such as listening to reports, group discussions, and answering questions. It also plans to train 2,400 propaganda cadres. Dalian City also plans to train 600 speakers first, and then continue to train 5,000 propagandists. In addition to planning to train speakers in a concentrated manner and train propagandists through teaching methods, Liaoxi Province will convene the second people's congress in each city and county after the draft constitution is promulgated, earnestly discuss the draft constitution, and listen to various beneficial opinions put forward by the people on the draft constitution. The provinces have also decided to establish draft constitution discussion committees in each city, county (banner). The districts, factories, mines, basic construction sites, organs, schools, and people's organizations in each city will also establish draft constitution discussion committees, sub-committees, or discussion groups.

[This newspaper reported] Fujian Province, Qinghai Province, and Qingdao City have established draft constitution discussion committees and held their first meetings.
