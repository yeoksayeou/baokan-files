    An Indelible Impression
    Ju Fuli, Member of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Model of Support for the Front in the Republic
    I have been visiting China for more than three months. During this not-so-short period, I have been living in the great friendship and warm care of the Chinese and Korean people all the time.
    In Chengdu, Sichuan Province, I met Deng Fangzhi, the mother of the Volunteer Army hero Huang Jiguang. Mother Huang went to the local people's government several times to ask to send her son to join the Volunteer Army; after her son arrived in Korea, she encouraged him, saying: Tell me often how many American devils you have killed. For the sake of the Korean people, for the sake of the Chinese people, come home after victory! The blood of the martyrs was shed on our country's land, and the hero's mother was standing beside me. I could not restrain my excitement and hugged this hero's mother tightly.
    I will never forget the meeting with Comrade Chen Lanxiu in Shanghai. Her son also sacrificed on our country's land, but she wiped away her tears and continued to work. Her job is to take care of bicycles, and she often works until three or four in the morning. She also donated her savings to the Korean front, donating more than 700,000 yuan in just three times. This mother also represents the strong character of Chinese mothers, but when she saw us, she could not help but shed tears of excitement. She said to us: "Late at night, I often think of Korea, of the Korean mothers and children. Whenever I think of their tragic experiences and their spirit of fighting the enemy, I feel that only by working harder can I be worthy of the Korean mothers and children!" What a strong and compassionate mother's heart!
    Such noble feelings can be found in the Chinese mothers I have met. Many Chinese mothers write to their children in Korea, instructing them to help the Korean people with construction.
    I am especially pleased that the wounded and sick of the Volunteer Army can recuperate in well-equipped hospitals or sanatoriums in their motherland, and are often cared for and loved by the Chinese people. When they saw us, they treated us like long-lost relatives, warmly entertained us, and talked to us to their heart's content. In Nanjing, we visited Liu Dengyun (transliteration), a wounded soldier of the Volunteer Army. He held my hand tightly and said: "On the Korean battlefield, whenever I saw the bridges and roads destroyed by the enemy, my heart burst with uncontrollable flames of revenge, and I was determined to help the Korean people rebuild their homes after the war. However, my leg was blown off by the enemy's artillery shells, and now I am still lying in bed, which is what I regret most. However, as soon as my injury heals, I will immediately go to the construction post of the motherland, work hard to produce, and support the recovery and construction of the Korean people!" What a noble friendship! At that time, I could no longer restrain my gratitude. I hugged him tightly in my arms and stroked him for a long time.
    Now, I am about to leave China, but I will never forget those warm handshakes, tight hugs, and conversations full of friendship and enthusiasm. They will become the strength to inspire me and countless Korean mothers. We must, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, contribute everything to the unification, independence, and democracy of the motherland, and to the post-war recovery and reconstruction of the Republic!

    不可磨灭的印象
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团员  共和国支前模范  具富力
    访问中国已经三个多月了。在这并不算短的时间里，我无时无刻不是生活在朝中人民的伟大友谊和亲切的关怀中。
    在四川成都市，我会见了志愿军英雄黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝妈妈。黄妈妈为了送自己的儿子参加志愿军，曾好几次到当地人民政府去要求；儿子到了朝鲜，她还这样鼓励儿子说：经常告诉我你打死了多少美国鬼子。为了朝鲜人民，为了中国人民，胜利后再回家来吧！烈士的鲜血洒在我们国家的土地上，而英雄的母亲就站在我身旁，我抑制不住自己感情的激动，紧紧地拥抱了这位英雄的妈妈。
    我永远也不会忘记在上海和陈兰秀同志的会见。她的儿子也牺牲在我们国家的土地上，但是她擦干了眼泪，仍然坚持工作。她的工作是保管自行车，每晚经常工作到夜里三、四点钟，还把积蓄下来的钱捐出来，送到了朝鲜前线，仅三次就捐了七十多万元。这位母亲同样代表着中国母亲的坚强性格，但当她看到我们时，却抑制不住流下了激动的热泪。她对我们说：“深夜，我经常会想起朝鲜，想起朝鲜的母亲和孩子。一想起他们的悲惨遭遇和对敌人斗争的精神，我就觉得只有更好地工作，才能对得起朝鲜的母亲和孩子！”多么坚强而慈善的母亲的心啊！
    像这样崇高的感情，在我接触过的中国母亲们的身上都可以找到。很多中国妈妈都给自己在朝鲜的儿女写信，嘱托他们帮助朝鲜人民建设。
    特别使我高兴的，是志愿军的伤病员都能在他们祖国设备完善的医院或疗养院休养，并且经常得到中国人民的关怀和热爱。他们看到我们，就好像看到了久别重逢的亲人一样，亲切地招待，尽情地畅谈。在南京，我们慰问了一位志愿军伤员柳登云（译音），他紧握着我的手这样说：“在朝鲜战场上，每当我看到被敌人炸毁的桥梁和道路，心中就迸发出抑止不住的复仇火焰，并下定决心战后要帮助朝鲜人民重建家园。可是，我的腿叫敌人的炮弹炸断了，现在还躺在病床上，这是我觉得最遗憾的事。但是，只要我的伤一好，马上就要走到祖国的建设岗位，努力生产，来支援朝鲜人民的恢复建设！”这是多么高尚的友谊啊！当时，我再也忍不住感谢的心情，我把他紧紧抱在怀里，抚摸了好久。
    现在，我就要离开中国了，可是，那些热烈的握手，紧紧的拥抱，充满友谊和热情的谈话，我将永远不会忘记，它们将成为鼓舞我和无数朝鲜母亲的力量。我们一定要在朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅的领导下，为了祖国的统一、独立和民主，为了共和国的战后恢复重建，贡献自己的一切！
