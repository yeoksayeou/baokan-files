    For the Happiness of the People
    Lu Naitao, Special-Class Model Worker of Anshan City

    I cannot express my feelings when I first saw the draft Constitution; I felt tears welling up in my eyes, especially when I saw the article “Citizens of the People's Republic of China have the right to work. The State, through planned development of the national economy, shall gradually expand employment, improve working conditions and wage treatment, to ensure that citizens enjoy this right.” I was even more moved and immediately felt I had so much to say to people.

    I am an old technical worker. In the old society, although I wanted to work, I could not get into a factory. During the period when Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, I worked in a small plant of Anshan Iron and Steel. As soon as the Japanese devils surrendered, the entire factory closed down, and hundreds of thousands of workers were immediately unemployed. I asked many people to help me find a job, but nothing came of it, so I had to sell junk; my family was so poor that we couldn't even afford sorghum porridge, eating one meal and not knowing where the next would come from. Later, the Kuomintang bandits ordered the factory to resume operation, and I tried every means to get back into the factory. But from the beginning to the end of the month, I often couldn't get paid, so I had to borrow from the factory, and each time I borrowed money, it was only enough for the whole family to eat half a month of sorghum. My eldest child was already twelve years old at that time, but we didn't have money for him to go to school, so he gathered firewood at home. Near the time of liberation, the factory shut down again, and I returned to my hometown to farm, where my family of five spent their days eating wild vegetable dumplings. The children were so hungry that they were just skin and bones, and my third child, with a big head and thin neck, couldn't even lift his head even when he was over a year old.

    After Anshan was liberated in October 1948, these things disappeared. As soon as I entered the factory, the factory gave me 150 jin of grain every month. By February 1949, I was getting more than 200 jin. Now I am living a life that is really too good to be true. In addition to a fixed salary of more than one million yuan each month, I also receive bonuses for exceeding my quota; because I work well, the factory has also rewarded me with bicycles, radios, watches, blankets, etc. My house has a bedroom, living room, study, and kitchen. I never even dared to dream of such a life in the past.

    Let me also talk about the working conditions in the factory. Before liberation, the factory treated us workers like dogs, and no one cared if a worker died on duty. I remember one summer, a steel bar scraped past my leg, burning away a large piece of flesh, and no one in the factory cared. I stayed at home for a month to recover, and not only did they not give me medical expenses, but they even deducted all my wages. The new society is not like that. The factory has installed safety shields on the machines; when workers are thirsty during work, they can drink soda and eat popsicles in the summer, and soybean milk is provided in the winter.

    After the draft Constitution was published, we saw even more clearly the bright future of our motherland. In the future, I will work hard to increase production so that the lives of our people will be happier and more fulfilling!

    为了人民的幸福
    鞍山市特等模范　卢乃涛
    我说不出我刚看宪法草案时的心情；我觉得眼泪直往外涌，特别是当我看到“中华人民共和国公民有劳动的权利。国家通过国民经济有计划的发展，逐步扩大劳动就业，改善劳动条件和工资待遇，以保证公民享受这种权利”这一条文时，更受感动，顿时感到心里有许多话想对人说。
    我是个老技术工人。在旧社会里，我虽想劳动，却进不了工厂。日本帝国主义占领东北时期，我在鞍钢小型厂作活，鬼子一投降，整个工厂关了门，十几万工人立刻失了业。我托了许多人找事，结果没有着落，只好卖破烂；家里穷得连高粱糊糊都吃不上，吃了这顿没那顿。后来国民党匪帮叫开工，我想尽办法总算回了厂。可是从月初忙到月底，常常领不到工资，只好向厂里借，而借一次钱，又只够全家吃半个月的高粱。我的大小孩那阵已经十二岁了，没钱念书，在家拾柴火。快解放的时候工厂又停工了，我回到家乡种地，一家五口整天吃野菜团子混日子。孩子们饿得只剩下一把骨头，我的第三个孩子，头大脖子细，长到一岁多，头还抬不起来。
    鞍山在一九四八年十月解放后，这些事儿就没了。我一进厂，厂里每月就给我一百五十斤粮食。到一九四九年二月我就拿二百多斤了。现在我过的日子真是好得没法说，每月除了固定工资一百多万元外，还有超额奖金；因为我工作得好，工厂还奖给我自行车、无线电、手表、毛毯等。我住的房子除寝室、客厅、书房外，还有厨房。这种生活，过去我真是连想都没敢想过。
    再谈一谈工厂的劳动条件。解放前，工厂把我们工人当只狗似的看待，工人因公死了也没人管。我记得有一年夏天，钢条从我的腿边擦过，一下子就烧去了一大块肉，厂里没人过问。我在家养了一个月，不但不给我医药费，连工资都给我扣光。新社会可不是那样，厂里给机器安装了安全罩设备；工人上班口干了，夏天可以喝汽水、吃冰棍，冬天准备有豆浆。
    宪法草案公布后，我们更清楚地看到了祖国的光明前途，今后我要努力增加生产，使我国人民的生活更加幸福，更加美满！
