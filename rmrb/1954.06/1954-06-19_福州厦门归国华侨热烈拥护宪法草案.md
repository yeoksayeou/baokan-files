Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th—Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Fuzhou and Xiamen are cheering the publication of the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

    Mr. Xu Man, a returned overseas Chinese from the Philippines residing in Fuzhou and a professor in the Chinese Department of Fujian Normal College, said: "The Draft Constitution clearly stipulates that 'The People's Republic of China protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad.' This embodies the meticulous care of the motherland for overseas Chinese and also embodies the firm will of the motherland to protect overseas Chinese." Zhang Zhuangfei, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya and vice chairman of the Fuzhou Overseas Chinese Federation, said: "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled China for more than 20 years, and only on the eve of their collapse did they pretend to convene a pseudo 'National Assembly' and pass the infamous pseudo 'Constitution.' The People's Republic of China was founded only four years ago, and today the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated. This Draft Constitution fully reflects the spirit of democracy. It guarantees various rights of citizens and also stipulates measures to gradually expand material guarantees. This is fundamentally different from the bourgeois constitution. I believe that millions of overseas Chinese will cheer for the promulgation of the Draft Constitution."
    More than 50 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese from the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation held a meeting to discuss the Draft Constitution. Yan Xiyue, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaya, recalled the suffering and persecution he had endured abroad. Thinking about how he was elected as a representative to the Xiamen Municipal People's Congress shortly after returning to China and is now living a free and happy life in the motherland, he deeply appreciated the value of the provision in the Draft Constitution that protects the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese abroad. He said: "The Draft Constitution has a total of 106 articles, and every article is beneficial to the people." More than 60 members of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation Textile Industrial Cooperative used their lunch break to recite all the articles of the Draft Constitution. Lin Bihua, Zhang Huiqing, and other relatives of overseas Chinese were originally housewives. After liberation, they entered the Textile Industrial Cooperative to work, learned weaving techniques, and gained employment opportunities like men. They said: "The Draft Constitution stipulates that the motherland should be built into a prosperous and happy socialist society. We must produce more actively so that this beautiful society will arrive soon." Chen Qushui, principal of the Fujian Province Jimei Overseas Chinese Students' Preparatory School, who worked in education abroad for more than 20 years, said: "Overseas Chinese students yearn for the motherland. After returning to the motherland, they receive the care and attention of the motherland and live a happy life in the motherland. Now, the Draft Constitution clearly stipulates that the state pays special attention to the physical and intellectual development of young people. This will not only stimulate the learning enthusiasm of returned overseas Chinese students, but also bring great encouragement to us educators."

    福州厦门归国华侨热烈拥护宪法草案
    【新华社福州十八日电】福州、厦门两市的归国华侨和华侨眷属为中华人民共和国宪法草案的公布而欢呼。
    居住在福州市的菲律宾归国华侨、福建师范学院中文系教授许曼老先生说：宪法草案明文规定“中华人民共和国保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益”，这体现了祖国对华侨的无微不至的关怀，同时也体现了祖国保护华侨的坚决意志。马来亚归国华侨、福州市归国华侨联谊会副主席张壮飞说：过去国民党反动派统治了中国二十多年，直到崩溃前夕，才装模作样地召开伪“国民大会”，通过臭名远扬的伪“宪法”。中华人民共和国成立才四年多，今天就公布了中华人民共和国宪法草案。这个宪法草案充分反映了民主的精神，它保证公民的各种权利，同时又规定逐步扩大物质保证的措施，这和资产阶级的宪法有着本质的不同。我相信，千百万国外华侨都会为宪法草案的公布而欢呼。
    厦门市归国华侨联谊会五十多位归国华侨和华侨眷属开会座谈宪法草案。马来亚归国华侨颜西岳回忆在国外遭受的痛苦和迫害，想到自己回国不久，就当选为厦门市人民代表大会代表，在祖国过着自由幸福的生活，因而深刻地体会到宪法草案规定保护国外华侨的正当的权利和利益这一条的可贵。他说：“宪法草案共有一百零六条，条条都对人民有利。”厦门市侨联纺织工业社六十多位社员，利用午后休息时间，朗诵宪法草案的全部条文。华侨眷属林碧华、张慧卿等，原来都是家庭妇女，解放后，进入纺织工业社作工，学会织布技术，和男子一样得到就业的机会。她们说：宪法草案规定祖国要建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，我们要更加积极生产，使这个美好的社会早日到来。曾经在国外从事二十多年教育工作的福建省集美华侨学生补习学校校长陈曲水说：“华侨学生向往祖国，他们回到祖国后，受到祖国的关怀和照顾，在祖国过着幸福的生活。现在，宪法草案又明文规定国家特别关怀青年的体力和智力的发展，这不但会激发起归国华侨学生的学习热情，同时也给我们教育工作者带来了极大的鼓舞。”
