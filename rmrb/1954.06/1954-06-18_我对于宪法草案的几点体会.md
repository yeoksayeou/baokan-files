My Reflections on the Draft Constitution
Zhong Huilan, Director of Beijing Central People's Hospital

Since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the wise Chairman Mao put forward the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China, enthusiastic discussions have been launched throughout the country. I had the honor of participating in the discussion of the initial draft of the Constitution. After repeated discussions, I have the following insights into the draft Constitution: First, I clearly realize that this draft Constitution could only be obtained after the Chinese Communist Party and the brilliant Chairman Mao led the Chinese people's revolution, overthrew the reactionary rule, and established a people's democratic system. It represents the common will of the Chinese people, is an innovation in Chinese history, and is also a major event in human history. It will play its due role in the cause of liberating all mankind and safeguarding world peace. Second, this draft Constitution is written based on the actual situation after the victory of the Chinese revolution. It fully expresses the fundamental requirements of our country's gradual transition to a socialist society and the common desire of the broad masses of people to further build a new life. The constitutions of past eras in China and other capitalist countries only represented the interests of a few people and were tools for oppressing the broad masses of people. Our Constitution is fundamentally different from them. Third, this draft Constitution is a document of historical significance. It was put forward from top to bottom, widely solicited opinions from bottom to top, fully promoted democracy in the discussion, unfolded debates, and finally used simple and clear language to record the existing achievements of the Chinese people's revolution. In terms of social and economic structure, national institutions, and basic rights and obligations of citizens, it is based on the actual situation of our country and draws on the experience of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to be revised into this complete draft Constitution. It fully meets the current needs of the Chinese people. The draft Constitution also stipulates that all citizens of the People's Republic of China are equal before the law, guaranteeing citizens' freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, demonstration, and religious belief. Citizens have the right to education, workers have the right to rest, and the right to obtain material assistance in old age, illness, or loss of working ability. These fully demonstrate that it is a constitution that truly represents the will of the broad masses of people and has great superiority, which forms a sharp contrast with the constitutions of the bourgeoisie that only seek the welfare of a few people. For these reasons, this draft Constitution will surely be supported by the broad masses of people.

    我对于宪法草案的几点体会
    北京中央人民医院院长  钟惠澜
    自中共中央和毛主席提出中华人民共和国宪法草案后，全国都热烈地展开讨论，我预先光荣地参加了关于宪法草案初稿的讨论。经过反复讨论，我对宪法草案有以下几点体会：一、我明确认识到，这个宪法草案是在中国共产党和英明的毛主席领导中国人民革命，推翻了反动统治，建立了人民民主制度之后，才能得到的。它代表了中国人民共同的意志，在中国历史上是个创举，在人类历史上也是一件大事，它对全人类的解放事业和维护世界和平，将起其应有的作用。二、这个宪法草案，是根据中国革命胜利后的实际情况而写出的，它充分表达了我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的根本要求和广大人民进一步建设新生活的共同愿望。中国过去各时代的和其他资本主义国家的宪法，只是代表少数人的利益，用以压迫广大人民的工具，我们的宪法和它们的有本质的不同。三、这个宪法草案是具有历史意义的文件，是自上而下提出，自下而上广泛征求意见，在讨论中充分发扬民主，展开争论，最后用简单明了的文字，记录了中国人民革命已有的成就，在社会经济结构和国家机构、公民基本权利义务各方面，均系以我国实际情况为基础，并吸取苏联和各人民民主国家的经验，而修改成为这一完整的宪法草案，它完全合乎中国人民当前的需要。宪法草案中还规定了：中华人民共和国全体公民在法律上一律平等，保障公民言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威和信仰宗教的自由，公民有享受教育的权利、劳动者有休息权利、以及在年老、疾病或者丧失劳动能力时获得物质帮助等权利，这都充分表明了它是一个真正代表广大人民意志、具有很大优越性的宪法，这与资产阶级那种仅仅为少数人谋福利的宪法，形成了强烈的对比。由于这些原因，所以这个宪法草案一定会得到广大人民的拥护。
